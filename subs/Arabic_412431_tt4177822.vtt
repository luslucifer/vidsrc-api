00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:49.702
Oh!

2
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:53.406
Come on, that's ridiculous.
Get over here, buddy.


3
00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:55.341
- Ahh!
- Hey!


4
00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:57.977
- That is so unfair!
- What do you mean it's unfair?


5
00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.046
- He was cheating!
- No way, he does not cheat,


6
00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:02.214
he has never
cheated in his entire life.


7
00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:05.685
Do you hear your mother?
What kind of weight advantage?


8
00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:06.752
Oh, you mean this weight
advantage?


9
00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:10.256
I do like that kind
of weight advantage.


10
00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:11.791
- Come here.
- Hi.


11
00:02:11.793 --> 00:02:12.792
Hi!

12
00:02:12.794 --> 00:02:15.795
Eww! Dad!

13
00:02:15.797 --> 00:02:18.364
- Eww!
- So gross! It's so yucky.


14
00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:21.967
Get a room.

15
00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.904
- Oh, shit.
- No! No, no!


16
00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:27.073
I'm sorry!
Hold on, hold on.


17
00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:31.477
It's price. Be right back!

18
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.945
<i>Hey, what up, handsome?</i>

19
00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:35.081
Hey, what's up?

20
00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:37.016
You throwin' the ball
around with the little one?


21
00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:38.484
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>
- Alright, well listen.


22
00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:40.052
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday.

23
00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:43.389
<i>I got this work to do,</i>
<i>we're gonna deal with it.</i>


24
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:48.160
We have some new information
but I think we have to walk
the client through it.


25
00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:50.963
- Okay.
- Okay, what about tomorrow
morning, is that good?


26
00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:53.833
- Yeah, Monday it is.
- Great, well say hi
to little fella for me.


27
00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:56.068
-<i>Of course.</i>
- Okay, mate. Alright, bye.


28
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.436
<i>Alright, bye.</i>

29
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.410
Hello, my dear.

30
00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:42.014
Alright, everything in order?

31
00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:44.183
- Yep.
- Thank you.


32
00:03:44.185 --> 00:03:46.051
We're good to go.

33
00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:55.161
My fellow Americans.

34
00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:58.931
Today in America, a teacher
spent extra time with a student


35
00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:00.900
who needed it,
and did her part


36
00:04:00.902 --> 00:04:03.569
to help lift America's
graduation rate to levels that


37
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:07.540
have been unsurpassed
for the past three decades.


38
00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:11.544
<i>An entrepreneur flipped</i>
<i>the lights on in her</i>
<i>high-tech start up company,</i>


39
00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:15.181
<i>and did her part to help add to</i>
<i>the more than eight million</i>


40
00:04:15.183 --> 00:04:21.153
<i>new jobs that American</i>
<i>businesses have created</i>
<i>over the past four years.</i>


41
00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:23.989
<i>An auto worker fine-tuned</i>
<i>some of the best,</i>


42
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:26.492
<i>most fuel efficient</i>
<i>cars in the world,</i>


43
00:04:26.494 --> 00:04:31.397
<i>and did his part to help</i>
<i>wean America off her dependence</i>
<i>on foreign oil.</i>


44
00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:34.433
<i>Now innovators</i>
<i>in America's top industries</i>


45
00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:38.237
<i>are leading the world on</i>
<i>a path to a brighter future.</i>


46
00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:41.207
<i>And it's time that our sworn</i>
<i>leaders...</i>


47
00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:42.308
Smells good, baby.

48
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.276
I'm starving!

49
00:04:44.278 --> 00:04:51.984
<i>Since the cold war,</i>
<i>our government has</i>
<i>employed a task force...</i>


50
00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:55.187
This guy's going to
make a difference.


51
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.123
<i>Now for decades, they've kept</i>
<i>a close watch on us.</i>


52
00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.059
<i>As we've slowly</i>
<i>given up our rights...</i>


53
00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:04.063
<i>- ...our privacy,</i>
- you're such a pessimist.


54
00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:08.133
No, I'm a realist.
Four years isn't that long.


55
00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:10.135
People like empty promises,
you know?


56
00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:12.137
<i>There is no domestic threat</i>
<i>great enough to warrant</i>


57
00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.907
<i>the violation of the rights</i>
<i>of the American people.</i>


58
00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.645
<i>And while the</i>
<i>us constitution contains</i>
<i>no express right to that end...</i>


59
00:05:19.647 --> 00:05:22.114
Speaking of promises...

60
00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.053
I think you owe me
one, don't ya?


61
00:05:28.055 --> 00:05:30.155
- Hm?
- Mm-hm, I might.


62
00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:33.025
I think this is collecting.
That's right.


63
00:05:33.027 --> 00:05:34.426
K, papi.

64
00:05:34.428 --> 00:05:38.998
Oh, by the way--
no, no, no, no, no, come on.


65
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.967
Where do you think
he learns it from? Hmm?


66
00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:49.074
Come on, can you go help him
wash up?


67
00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.210
Sure.

68
00:05:53.146 --> 00:05:54.179
What?

69
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:56.215
I'm just lookin' at you.

70
00:06:01.655 --> 00:06:03.322
You gotta take out the trash.

71
00:06:03.324 --> 00:06:09.528
<i>incurred by the American</i>
<i>people at the hands of the NSA,</i>


72

<i>the FBI, CIA,</i>
<i>or any other special</i>
<i>intelligence task force.</i>


73
00:06:18.204 --> 00:06:19.972
<i>My fellow Americans,</i>

74
00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:22.341

75
00:06:22.343 --> 00:06:26.178
<i>that privacy of</i>
<i>the American people is upheld.</i>


76
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.015
<i>And that the American people</i>
<i>are neither surveilled,</i>

77
00:06:30.017 --> 00:06:32.584
<i>that we all feel safe</i>

79
00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:41.493
<i>My fellow Americans,</i>
<i>thank you for tuning in</i>
<i>tonight and listening.</i>


80
00:06:41.495 --> 00:06:45.297
<i>May god bless you</i>
<i>and may god bless America.</i>


81
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.368
Whoa!
Easy there, buddy.


82
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.736
I think it's a little
bit past your bedtime!


83
00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:53.272
- No way.
- No way?


84
00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:54.373
No way, what are you kidding me?

85
00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:57.176
Get over here
you little munchkin. Ooh!


86
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.412
Alright.
Time for bed.


87
00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:05.384
Alright, spider monkey, bedtime.

88
00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:08.153
But, dad?
I'm not tired.


89
00:07:08.155 --> 00:07:11.357
Alright, I'll tell you what,
if you don't tell your mother,


90
00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:12.992
I'll read you another chapter,
okay?


91
00:07:12.994 --> 00:07:16.328
- Pinky promise.
- Pinky promise.


92
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.763
You know that's real right?

93
00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:21.266
Hold on.

94
00:07:21.268 --> 00:07:23.068
Another chapter it is.

95
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.704
So, oh, this is a good one.

96
00:07:25.706 --> 00:07:29.742
"This is not what I asked for,
this is not what I planned.


97
00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:34.747
When I said, 'okay, you can bury
me, up to my neck in sand.'"


98
00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:37.416
ahh...

99
00:07:37.418 --> 00:07:38.484
Go to sleep.

100
00:07:42.422 --> 00:07:44.356
I'm turning the lights out.

101
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:57.436
- Hi.
- Hi.


102
00:07:57.438 --> 00:07:59.471
God you smell good.

103
00:08:06.346 --> 00:08:08.247
Come here...

104
00:09:15.548 --> 00:09:17.749
I love you.

105

Shit.

106

You gotta be fuckin'
kidding me with this trash.


107
00:11:25.545 --> 00:11:28.880
What the fuck is this?

108
00:11:39.392 --> 00:11:41.260
Put him in the bag.

109
00:11:58.411 --> 00:11:59.611
John?

110
00:11:59.613 --> 00:12:00.812
John?

111
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.617
John?

112
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.864
Go get the wife.

113
00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:20.699
Got it.

114
00:12:20.967 --> 00:12:22.701
I got the front.

115
00:12:22.703 --> 00:12:24.569
I'll go grab the kid.

116
00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:28.040
Come on,

117
00:12:28.042 --> 00:12:29.708
I can hear ya.

118
00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:34.713
Look, I don't know any
answers to your questions.

Please, just let me go.

120

I'm an insurance agent,

131
00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:14.086
What do you

132
00:13:14.088 --> 00:13:15.921
I have no idea about that!

133
00:13:16.523 --> 00:13:21.126
- Who's your contact?
- I got no fuckin' contact.

00:13:21.128 --> 00:13:24.896
- Who's your contact? Huh?
- You got the wrong guy.


135
00:13:24.898 --> 00:13:27.599
Give me something.

136
00:13:27.601 --> 00:13:30.969
You gotta give me something.
We're gonna do this all night
until you give me something.


137
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:33.672
Who are your contacts?
Hmm?


138
00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:35.640
Come on, buddy.
Tell me something.


139
00:13:35.642 --> 00:13:37.676
I don't have
any fucking contacts.


140
00:13:37.678 --> 00:13:38.677
I don't have

You can torture me
all day, fool.


145
00:13:53.694 --> 00:13:54.993
I don't have any
answers for you.


146
00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:58.397
I can't hear you!
Who are you working with?!


147
00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:59.531
I don't know what to tell ya.

148
00:13:59.533 --> 00:14:01.133
I'm a fucking

Alright, you're an
insurance salesman, right?

- Yeah, that's it!
- I hope you life insurance,
mother fucker.


152
00:14:13.746 --> 00:14:15.580
Let me get something
out of this guy.


153
00:14:15.582 --> 00:14:17.682
You're a fuckin' dead man
if you don't start talking.


154
00:14:17.684 --> 00:14:18.984
Come on, give me something.

155
00:14:18.986 --> 00:14:20.819
Wait.

156
00:14:23.656 --> 00:14:26.558
You fucking confess.

157
00:14:27.026 --> 00:14:28.660
Alright.

158
00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:30.762
Alright, you're right.

159
00:14:31.998 --> 00:14:34.633
My name is Steven white. Okay?

160
00:14:34.635 --> 00:14:37.035
I used to be an agent.
I retired.


161
00:14:37.037 --> 00:14:39.805
They forced me
out of the agency.


162
00:14:39.807 --> 00:14:42.174
I have no fucking idea what
operation jackknife is.


163
00:14:42.176 --> 00:14:44.743
I have no idea!

164
00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:46.845
I don't work for
anybody anymore. Okay?


165
00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:49.748
I'm a family man.
I got a wife, a kid, that's it.


166
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.917
<i>I swear to god.</i>

167
00:15:00.927 --> 00:15:02.694
Hi, babe.

168
00:15:32.225 --> 00:15:33.225
- Mark?
- - Mom!


169
00:15:33.227 --> 00:15:35.894
- Help! Mom!
- Mark! Mark!


170
00:15:35.896 --> 00:15:37.629
- Mom! Help.
- Mark!


171
00:15:37.631 --> 00:15:40.799
- No, no, no!
- Mom! Help!


172
00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:43.768
No! My little baby!

173
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.904
What do you want from me? Huh?

174
00:15:51.712 --> 00:15:52.744
Rebecca?

175
00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:55.714
<i>Listen to me, is mark with you?</i>

176
00:15:55.716 --> 00:15:56.948
<i>Huh?</i>

177
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.817
- No!
<i>- Do what I say, okay?</i>


178
00:15:58.819 --> 00:16:04.055
I'm gonna come get you.
Okay? Hold on, I love you.


179
00:16:04.057 --> 00:16:06.525
Rebecca!

180
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.094
You're getting the picture now,
Johnny.


181
00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:12.898
Yeah. Don't fuck with my family.
You understand me?


182
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.566
You are not gonna do shit.

183
00:16:14.568 --> 00:16:16.868
You're not giving the orders
here, pal. We are.


184
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.973
And we'll let your family go
after you do something for us.


185
00:16:21.975 --> 00:16:25.911
You mess with my family, I swear
to god I'm gonna hunt you down.


186
00:16:25.913 --> 00:16:28.647
You fuckin' be easy, buddy.

187
00:16:28.649 --> 00:16:30.916
I'm gonna kill you.

188
00:16:30.918 --> 00:16:31.883
All in good time.

189
00:16:31.885 --> 00:16:33.118
Kill my family, 
I swear to god.

190
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.320
Prep this son of a bitch
for transport.


191
00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:40.191
Your family, their lives
are in your hands.


192
00:16:40.193 --> 00:16:42.794
Your life is in my hands.

193
00:16:42.796 --> 00:16:47.632
You hurt my family, I will
find you, I will hunt you down,


194
00:16:47.634 --> 00:16:50.635
and I will kill you.
Do you understand me?


195
00:16:50.637 --> 00:16:52.938
You ain't gonna do
a goddamn thing!


196
00:17:45.224 --> 00:17:47.792
Number three
step forward please.


197
00:17:51.664 --> 00:17:55.000
- Is that the man?
- No.


198
00:17:55.002 --> 00:17:58.703
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.


199
00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:00.839
Step back.

200
00:18:01.674 --> 00:18:03.908
Number four,
step forward please.


201
00:18:10.716 --> 00:18:12.217
Is this the man?

202
00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:15.954
That's him.

203
00:18:15.956 --> 00:18:19.057
It was dark. This is the man
who climbed in your window?


204
00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:21.126
- That's him.
- You're sure?


205
00:18:21.128 --> 00:18:22.894
I'm sure.

206
00:18:25.698 --> 00:18:28.767
Take number four
to a conference room please.


207
00:18:31.003 --> 00:18:32.971
Detective Weston...

208
00:18:32.973 --> 00:18:34.873
Can you come with me, please?

209
00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:37.108
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

210
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:50.055
Well, that looks like
precision shooting.


211
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.424
We got five dead bodies,

212
00:18:52.426 --> 00:18:55.727
enough physical evidence to fill
a couple of evidence lockers.


213
00:18:55.729 --> 00:19:00.165
I'm busy just thinking about all
the paperwork that's gonna
come from this one.


214
00:19:00.167 --> 00:19:02.901
Who was the primary
on the scene?


215
00:19:02.903 --> 00:19:06.004
We got a call from
a couple kids, thought
they heard firecrackers.


216
00:19:06.006 --> 00:19:07.972
Needless to say,
it wasn't firecrackers.


217
00:19:07.974 --> 00:19:10.742
These kids gonna need
a lot of therapy
in the near future, huh?


218
00:19:10.744 --> 00:19:12.911
- Probably.
- Where you going?


219
00:19:12.913 --> 00:19:14.879
Get back here,
I'm talkin' to you.


220
00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:17.015
- You got a problem with me?
- No.


221
00:19:17.017 --> 00:19:21.086
Carle, why don't you
fix your fuckin' name tag?


222
00:19:21.088 --> 00:19:23.421
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Yes, sir.


223
00:19:31.897 --> 00:19:33.098
Detective Walsh.

224
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.066
- Detective--
- walk me through it.


225
00:19:35.068 --> 00:19:39.003
Well, evidence is scarce
and CSI has not shown up yet.


226
00:19:39.005 --> 00:19:41.072
We've pulled what we can
from their drivers' licenses.


227
00:19:41.074 --> 00:19:43.475
Based on time of death
and weapons used,


228
00:19:43.477 --> 00:19:46.010
we can give you an approximate
idea of what we think happened--


229
00:19:46.012 --> 00:19:48.813
at this stage of the game,
approximate is fine.
Let's go, come on.


230
00:19:48.815 --> 00:19:51.182
Okay, so here we have
a Jim Lee and Damon Reeves.


231
00:19:51.184 --> 00:19:53.118
Jim was an accountant.

232
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.353
Damon, he worked at a bank.

233
00:19:55.355 --> 00:19:58.022
The thing with Damon,
is that his wallet was missing.


234
00:19:58.024 --> 00:20:02.961
we're thinking
the guy who killed him,
also took his wallet.


235
00:20:02.963 --> 00:20:05.196
His weapons were
missing as well.


236
00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:07.031
So our boy is armed.

237
00:20:07.033 --> 00:20:09.300
Considering the carnage,
I'm not surprised.


238
00:20:09.302 --> 00:20:13.304
Over here we have Sean Reeves,
a Mike power and Martin chance.


239
00:20:13.306 --> 00:20:17.542
Sean was a teacher, Mike was
a vet and Martin well, uh,
he was a nurse.


240
00:20:17.544 --> 00:20:20.345
That's a pretty rough
looking nurse.


241
00:20:20.347 --> 00:20:22.113
How bout this guy,
the black guy?


242
00:20:22.115 --> 00:20:23.882
Well,
that's the interesting thing.


243
00:20:23.884 --> 00:20:25.550
See we can't find
anything on this guy.


244
00:20:25.552 --> 00:20:27.886
When we pulled up the
driver's license we found,


245
00:20:27.888 --> 00:20:30.054
it came up with
a Peter Morris.


246
00:20:30.056 --> 00:20:33.925
The thing is, the Peter Morris
we found has actually been
dead for over ten years.


247
00:20:33.927 --> 00:20:36.327
We'll know more when we get
the test results back.


248
00:20:40.833 --> 00:20:43.067
What about the guy in the chair,
what do you have on him?


249
00:20:43.069 --> 00:20:47.906
Well, what we can tell so far,
it looks like he single handedly
killed every single guy here.


250
00:20:47.908 --> 00:20:50.141
We have no idea who this guy is.

251
00:20:50.143 --> 00:20:55.280
Once we get the test results
back from his blood, urine
and whatever he had for lunch,


252
00:20:55.282 --> 00:20:56.381
we should know
a little bit more.


253
00:20:56.383 --> 00:20:59.150
So, they beat the shit
out of this guy,


254
00:20:59.152 --> 00:21:02.187
and he still manages to get
loose and kill all five of them


255
00:21:02.189 --> 00:21:06.524
Well, that's just perfect,
we should close this case
by lunch tomorrow.


256
00:21:06.526 --> 00:21:08.059
Fuck.

257
00:21:09.396 --> 00:21:11.162
Why is this funny?

258
00:21:15.534 --> 00:21:18.069
Officers found that
with a bunch of kids.


259
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:20.171
Well, that's a high end cell
phone for a kid, isn't it?


260
00:21:20.173 --> 00:21:22.207
That's exactly what
the officer said.


261
00:21:22.209 --> 00:21:24.509
We ran some tests
on the last calls made


262
00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:27.912
and they match up with the exact
time of the victims' death.


263
00:21:27.914 --> 00:21:32.150
On top of that, we have a
John and Rebecca niles address.


264
00:21:32.152 --> 00:21:33.952
We don't have anyone
here with that name.


265
00:21:33.954 --> 00:21:36.120
Did you send a black
and white to this address?


266
00:21:36.122 --> 00:21:40.391
Well, you better send backup
because if John niles is the guy


267
00:21:40.393 --> 00:21:43.995
who was in this chair, it's
gonna be a fuckin' disaster.


268
00:21:43.997 --> 00:21:47.065
So what are you thinking,
it's some sort of undercover
operation gone wrong?


269
00:21:47.067 --> 00:21:51.302
I have no idea,
but these mother fucking fake
ids are getting me pissed off.


270
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:56.641
Yeah, Weston.

271
00:21:57.476 --> 00:21:59.177
Sorry, sir.

272
00:22:00.112 --> 00:22:04.148
Carle.
Assist detective Walsh.


273
00:22:05.384 --> 00:22:07.652
I can't hear you,
you got, you gotta..


274
00:22:07.654 --> 00:22:10.955
Wait 'til I'm outside.
Hang on.


275
00:22:14.194 --> 00:22:18.096
Take the next exit,
let's get out of this mess.


276
00:22:28.274 --> 00:22:33.444
Okay, there you are.
No, I couldn't hear you inside,
so now I'm going outside.


277
00:22:33.446 --> 00:22:37.015
Marie, I couldn't get any
reception inside, now I got it.


278
00:22:37.017 --> 00:22:38.216
Is everything alright?

279
00:22:46.592 --> 00:22:50.128
Marie, call 911.

280
00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:03.401
<i>I am really impressed, Johnny.</i>

281
00:24:03.403 --> 00:24:05.336
You aren't rusty at all.

282
00:24:05.338 --> 00:24:08.339
You hurt them, I swear
on my life I'll kill you.


283
00:24:08.341 --> 00:24:11.509
After what you pulled at the
warehouse, I don't doubt that.


284
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:13.644
Listen, John, this is simple:

285
00:24:13.646 --> 00:24:16.247
<i>Do what we ask when we ask.</i>
<i>Alright?</i>


286
00:24:16.249 --> 00:24:20.118
This is a time sensitive
situation. So no more games!


287
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.787
You don't need them.
All you need is me.


288
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:24.389
Tell me what you want me to do.

289
00:24:24.391 --> 00:24:28.493
Oh, and John, you might
want to leave your house.


290
00:24:28.495 --> 00:24:30.128
<i>Right now.</i>

291
00:24:37.703 --> 00:24:42.373
Dispatch, we're on a site
at 15925 Dawson Lane.


292
00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:44.776
It's pretty quiet,
we're gonna go check it out.


293
00:24:50.282 --> 00:24:52.316
Hold up. Door's open.

294
00:25:01.326 --> 00:25:03.194
Drop your gun, drop your gun!

295
00:25:03.196 --> 00:25:05.263
Drop your gun!
Drop your gun, man.


296
00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:06.731
Drop your gun!

297
00:25:06.733 --> 00:25:08.433
Drop your fucking gun, man.

298
00:25:13.472 --> 00:25:15.273
Think about
what you're doin', man.


299
00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:18.409
What the hell do you think
you're doing?


300
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:22.146
What the fuck?
Don't be stupid.


301
00:25:22.148 --> 00:25:23.781
Think about what you're doing.

302
00:25:30.457 --> 00:25:32.323
Are you kidding me?

303
00:25:39.398 --> 00:25:41.265
There you are, captain.

304
00:25:43.368 --> 00:25:46.437
Your itineraries are in the
final draft of your remarks.


305
00:25:46.439 --> 00:25:47.472
Thank you, Roger.

306
00:25:47.474 --> 00:25:49.674
Any updates on that, uh,

307
00:25:49.676 --> 00:25:53.244
on that CIA bt 85
legislation, you know,


308
00:25:53.246 --> 00:25:57.415
I want to move quickly on this,
as we've made privacy our
central theme and main focus.


309
00:25:57.417 --> 00:26:00.118
I can have you a copy,
sir, in a couple of hours.


310
00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:04.889
- Do you have my glasses, Roger?
- No, no I don't have 'em.


311
00:26:04.891 --> 00:26:09.193
Alright, well, looks like
that's gonna have to wait.


312
00:26:10.129 --> 00:26:11.462
Cheers.

313
00:26:25.545 --> 00:26:29.514
- Mr. president, five minutes.
- Thank you, Roger.


314
00:26:33.185 --> 00:26:34.519
Here, let me help you with that.

315
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:36.587
- Ahh...
- Mm.


316
00:26:38.491 --> 00:26:40.892
Almost.

317
00:26:40.894 --> 00:26:43.461
You know how much I hate
these dog and pony shows.


318
00:26:43.463 --> 00:26:46.464
- Oh, I know.
- Be a love and go for me?


319
00:26:46.466 --> 00:26:49.534
- You'll be fine.
- Says you.


320
00:26:52.504 --> 00:26:54.338
Oops.

321
00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:00.678
showing up to this dog
and pony show wearing,
oh, good, lipstick.


322
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.880
Well, might be an improvement.

323
00:27:02.882 --> 00:27:05.550
I don't think so.

324
00:27:08.453 --> 00:27:10.755
I still feel like
it needs some help.


325
00:27:41.753 --> 00:27:43.487
Yeah, it's me.

326
00:27:43.489 --> 00:27:45.623
<i>Meet me at the spot</i>
<i>in one hour.</i>


327
00:27:46.391 --> 00:27:47.625
<i>Yeah.</i>

328
00:27:47.926 --> 00:27:49.594
Be there.

329
00:28:06.478 --> 00:28:08.479
Look, I'm trying
to tell you what happened.


330
00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:11.983
This guy, he went through us
like we weren't even there.
Cut right through us.


331
00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:13.985
Shit, he had me dead to rights
he could have killed me.


332
00:28:13.987 --> 00:28:15.553
Shit, for that matter
he could have killed us both.


333
00:28:15.555 --> 00:28:16.487
Just sit down.

334
00:28:16.489 --> 00:28:18.022
- Green.
- Waters.


335
00:28:19.858 --> 00:28:22.960
It doesn't change the fact
that we have what used to be


336
00:28:22.962 --> 00:28:25.963
a warehouse full of dead cops.

337
00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:28.399
Well, I mean seriously,
ask yourself...


338
00:28:28.401 --> 00:28:30.568
If this guy's such a stone cold
killer than why the hell


339
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.902
would he go through
the trouble of taking us down


340
00:28:31.904 --> 00:28:33.904
with his hands
instead of using a gun?


341
00:28:33.906 --> 00:28:35.773
I mean, Christ, he had
a gun in each hand by the time


342
00:28:35.775 --> 00:28:37.642
he was done dancing with us.

343
00:28:38.577 --> 00:28:41.712
I don't know.
That's what I have to find out.


344
00:28:42.814 --> 00:28:44.949
Sir, I'm just sayin, I think,

345
00:28:44.951 --> 00:28:47.518
I think you should look
a little deeper because I'm...


346
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.890
Well for the moment he's my
only lead, which makes him
my only suspect.


347
00:28:52.892 --> 00:28:55.826
Real question is,
who is John niles?


348
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.735
What the fuck did you
get me involved in?


349
00:29:37.737 --> 00:29:39.103
We had solid intelligence,

350
00:29:39.105 --> 00:29:41.572
there was a major threat
on some government officials.


351
00:29:41.574 --> 00:29:44.608
We wanted to get you
on the inside to find out
what their planning.


352
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.344
You didn't tell me
the risk factor.


353
00:29:46.346 --> 00:29:49.113
- You threw me in blind.
- We didn't know the facts.


354
00:29:49.115 --> 00:29:51.582
Oh, you didn't know the facts?
Well, now people are dead.


355
00:29:51.584 --> 00:29:53.517
And they have my family.

356
00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:55.753
You threw me
into the fucking lion's den.


357
00:29:55.755 --> 00:29:59.457
And I apologize. We didn't know
they'd get your family.


358
00:29:59.459 --> 00:30:03.127
- Do they know I'm a plant?
- No, absolutely impossible.


359
00:30:03.129 --> 00:30:05.029
I did this because I owed you.

360
00:30:05.031 --> 00:30:07.998
You said it would
be a no risk operation.


361
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.768
They have
my fucking family, Mike.


362
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:15.706
- That's not low risk.
- I know. I apologize for that.


363
00:30:15.708 --> 00:30:18.909
Stand by me,
I'll give you my word.
We'll get your family back.


364
00:30:20.078 --> 00:30:21.746
The men you took pictures of...

365
00:30:21.748 --> 00:30:23.714
- Mm-hmm?
- They report to this man.


366
00:30:24.616 --> 00:30:27.084
- David Marino.
- Yeah, we met.


367
00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:28.753
Who is he?

368
00:30:28.755 --> 00:30:32.890
Not only does he do
a lot of killing, he enjoys it.


369
00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:36.026
Who does he work for?

370
00:30:36.895 --> 00:30:39.096
The CIA.

371
00:30:39.098 --> 00:30:40.498
You're kidding me.

372
00:30:48.073 --> 00:30:49.874
Be ready at 12:00.

373
00:31:07.859 --> 00:31:09.093
Marino's lost it.

374
00:31:09.095 --> 00:31:11.762
He's got his men
hunting everybody.


375
00:31:11.764 --> 00:31:12.830
If he gets out of prison--

376
00:31:12.832 --> 00:31:14.698
so this is operation jackknife?

377
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.834
Until recently
it was just theory.


378
00:31:16.836 --> 00:31:18.636
The president signed
his own death warrant


379
00:31:18.638 --> 00:31:20.171
when he tried to
decommission the CIA,


380
00:31:20.173 --> 00:31:21.739
but now they want to make sure
that you're involved.


381
00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:23.808
Why the fuck
do they want me involved?


382
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.843
You're the perfect scapegoat,
John.


383
00:31:25.845 --> 00:31:27.845
- You're off everybody's radar.
- This is happening?


384
00:31:27.847 --> 00:31:29.480
Yeah, but we've got you covered.

385
00:31:29.482 --> 00:31:30.781
They're gonna fuckin'
hang me out to dry.


386
00:31:30.783 --> 00:31:32.983
They're gonna leave me
on the fucking roof, Mike.


387
00:31:32.985 --> 00:31:35.085
John, you fucked up,
you got to pull it together.


388
00:31:35.087 --> 00:31:38.088
Your family's side of it,
we'll deal with.


389
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.524
But you gotta
stay off the radar.


390
00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:44.094
Now, listen, if anything gets
too hot, this is your fail safe.


391
00:31:44.096 --> 00:31:48.065
It's got everything about
the president, CIA, Marino,


392
00:31:48.067 --> 00:31:50.534
9/11, the fucking works.

393
00:31:50.536 --> 00:31:52.736
This is your get out of
jail free card, John.


394
00:31:52.738 --> 00:31:56.073
This mother fucker
will save your life.


395
00:31:56.075 --> 00:31:58.075
So guard it with your life.

396
00:31:59.744 --> 00:32:01.212
- Thank you.
- Good luck.


397
00:32:04.716 --> 00:32:06.550
Let's go, John.

398
00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:11.822
- Take the roof, John.
- Yep.


399
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:26.237
Here, take the keys.

400
00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:29.139
There's a car downstairs, go!
Go!


401
00:34:13.612 --> 00:34:15.012
He's out cold.

402
00:35:45.004 --> 00:35:46.303
<i>- Dad!</i>
- Mark?


403
00:35:46.305 --> 00:35:48.105
<i>- Dad!</i>
- Mark!


404
00:35:48.107 --> 00:35:50.107
- You okay, buddy?
<i>- Dad!</i>


405
00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.843
You've had your proof of life.

406
00:35:52.845 --> 00:35:54.178
Now the next 30 seconds

407
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.080
will determine whether
your family lives or dies.


408
00:35:56.082 --> 00:35:58.415
So you better be
pretty fucking convincing!


409
00:36:00.085 --> 00:36:01.985
Why did you contact this man?

410
00:36:04.723 --> 00:36:07.057
Price was my handler
back when I was an agent.


411
00:36:07.059 --> 00:36:08.392
I knew I couldn't
go to the cops,


412
00:36:08.394 --> 00:36:10.127
he was the only one
i could turn to.


413
00:36:10.129 --> 00:36:13.163
He said the guys
at the warehouse were CIA.


414
00:36:13.165 --> 00:36:15.899
But he had no fucking idea
why I was involved.


415
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:17.034
- And?
- That's it.


416
00:36:17.036 --> 00:36:18.368
Your goons showed up.

417
00:36:22.874 --> 00:36:24.408
Alright, I suppose since we
don't have the luxury of time


418
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:26.143
we're gonna have to trust you.
You find anything?


419
00:36:26.145 --> 00:36:28.479
Nothing. Price didn't have
anything on his computer.


420
00:36:28.481 --> 00:36:31.014
No mention of either
jackknife or niles.


421
00:36:33.118 --> 00:36:35.052
Alright, we move forward.

422
00:36:35.054 --> 00:36:37.087
John, you do what we say
when we say it,


423
00:36:37.089 --> 00:36:39.056
and your family will be okay.

424
00:36:39.058 --> 00:36:41.859
And this will all be over.
Alright, go ahead.


425
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:44.228
Sweet dreams, John.

426
00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.774
- Everything ready, Marino?
<i>- We're in good time.</i>


427
00:36:56.776 --> 00:37:01.411
<i>I don't have to remind you</i>
<i>what's at stake here,</i>
<i>do I, agent?</i>


428
00:37:01.413 --> 00:37:07.284
The surveillance program is
a critical part of our national
defense system.


429
00:37:07.286 --> 00:37:11.054
This bill our president passed
is not only unconstitutional,


430
00:37:11.056 --> 00:37:15.192
but it undermines the exact
fiber of all of our defense
organizations.


431
00:37:15.194 --> 00:37:19.029
<i>Our enemies are no longer</i>
<i>faceless foreigners.</i>


432
00:37:19.031 --> 00:37:23.167
<i>We have snakes in the garden,</i>
<i>Marino. Wolves at our gates.</i>


433
00:37:23.169 --> 00:37:26.837
And we must do anything
and everything in our power
to protect this country.


434
00:37:26.839 --> 00:37:29.973
We can no longer
trust the president to do so.


435
00:37:29.975 --> 00:37:31.875
<i>Don't disappoint me.</i>

436
00:37:31.877 --> 00:37:33.911
Don't let your country down.

437
00:37:33.913 --> 00:37:35.312
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

438
00:38:31.102 --> 00:38:31.103
Yeah?

439
00:38:31.103 --> 00:38:34.037
<i>John? You do what we say,</i>

440
00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:35.272
<i>this will all be over soon.</i>

441
00:38:40.879 --> 00:38:42.112
I got it.

442
00:38:57.929 --> 00:39:00.297
Roger, I'm going over
the bt 85 document


443
00:39:00.299 --> 00:39:01.632
and everything looks good.

444
00:39:01.634 --> 00:39:04.268
So I'll sign off on when I,
uh, wrap up this circus.


445
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.237
Just make sure to let the
director know it's being signed.


446
00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:09.239
It won't go into effect
immediately,


447
00:39:09.241 --> 00:39:11.408
so, I want a smooth transition.

448
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.076
It'll be best for everyone,
alright?


449
00:39:13.078 --> 00:39:16.013
I don't want any fallout
on this one. Thank you.


450
00:39:27.592 --> 00:39:30.560
Now look,
we're watching everything.


451
00:39:31.462 --> 00:39:33.463
You getting the picture now,
Johnny?


452
00:39:33.465 --> 00:39:35.933
Move east along 42nd street.

453
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.470
Turn north.

454
00:40:28.353 --> 00:40:30.153
Enter the building.

455
00:40:53.244 --> 00:40:56.046
- You ready for this?
- Yes, sir.


456
00:40:57.515 --> 00:41:01.485
Poacher's on site, we'll meet
you at location foxtrot.


457
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:12.131
Why you doin' this to me?

458
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:16.333
<i>Sometimes a great</i>
<i>sacrifice is necessary.</i>


459
00:41:16.335 --> 00:41:18.568
<i>Your leader is weak</i>
<i>and you're in combat.</i>


460
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.304
<i>You remove him</i>
<i>in order to survive.</i>


461
00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:25.409
You're never going to
get away with this.


462
00:41:25.411 --> 00:41:29.479
<i>Look people still argue as to</i>
<i>whether or not oswald acted</i>
<i>alone</i>


463
00:41:29.481 --> 00:41:31.348
<i>or if he even took the shot.</i>

464
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:33.050
At the end of the day
it didn't matter.


465
00:41:33.052 --> 00:41:34.751
The president was still dead.

466
00:41:35.553 --> 00:41:37.421
<i>Pick up his rifle.</i>

467
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:39.423
What if I can't do it?

468
00:41:39.425 --> 00:41:41.324
<i>Can't is the cancer of can.</i>

469
00:41:41.326 --> 00:41:42.659
<i>Now for the sake</i>
<i>of your family,</i>


470
00:41:42.661 --> 00:41:44.561
I suggest you give it
your best effort.


471
00:41:44.563 --> 00:41:46.363
<i>The clock is ticking, John.</i>

472
00:41:46.365 --> 00:41:48.331
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>time to debate this.</i>


473
00:41:49.801 --> 00:41:51.701
And you're the best there is.

474
00:41:51.703 --> 00:41:53.503
<i>Take the shot, John.</i>

475
00:41:56.607 --> 00:41:58.642
Take this shot,
John or your kid's gonna suffer.


476
00:41:58.644 --> 00:42:00.243
Fuck you.

477
00:42:01.646 --> 00:42:05.182
Just take the goddamn shot,
niles, stop being a pussy!


478
00:42:30.274 --> 00:42:32.342
Negative, sir.
No sign of him anywhere.


479
00:42:32.344 --> 00:42:34.511
About to do a sweep
of the perimeter.


480
00:42:55.633 --> 00:42:57.667
It's done.
The president's down.


481
00:42:57.669 --> 00:43:00.403
You got your patsy.
Now release my family.


482
00:43:00.405 --> 00:43:02.906
<i>You're not giving</i>
<i>the fuckin' orders here, pal.</i>


483
00:43:03.541 --> 00:43:05.509
<i>You got that?</i>

484
00:43:05.511 --> 00:43:08.345
or I'll walk to the nearest
television station


485
00:43:08.347 --> 00:43:10.447
and tell them what I did
and why I did it.


486
00:43:10.449 --> 00:43:12.516
You really think anybody's
gonna believe you?


487
00:43:12.518 --> 00:43:14.217
Especially after what
you've done?


488
00:43:14.219 --> 00:43:16.553
I'll shout so loud
they'll have to listen.


489
00:43:17.188 --> 00:43:19.322
You want me, let 'em go.

490
00:43:19.324 --> 00:43:22.459
<i>Niles, you're in no</i>
<i>position to bargain.</i>


491
00:43:23.628 --> 00:43:25.428
Fucker hung up on me.

492
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:28.431
Release the kid. See if we can
flush the daddy out.


493
00:43:56.661 --> 00:43:59.229
You better find your daddy, kid.

494
00:44:03.467 --> 00:44:04.801
Does anyone have eyes on niles?

495
00:44:04.803 --> 00:44:06.369
Negative.

496
00:44:10.408 --> 00:44:12.242
Go, you go!

497
00:44:28.726 --> 00:44:32.729
Dad! Dad!

498
00:44:50.781 --> 00:44:53.850
- Dad?
- Come on, kid,
show us where your father is.


499
00:44:59.523 --> 00:45:02.792
- Anything?
- Nothing, no eyes on target.


500
00:45:05.563 --> 00:45:07.797
Mark, come here, buddy.

501
00:45:09.567 --> 00:45:12.269
Fuck it, just shoot
the little bastard.


502
00:45:12.603 --> 00:45:14.271
Come on, buddy.

503
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:20.944
Come on, buddy, come on.
Come on, come on.


504
00:45:33.658 --> 00:45:35.292
Fuck.

505
00:45:40.564 --> 00:45:45.468
I am not paying 400 dollars for
aspirin. Four hundred dollars?!


506
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.470
For aspirin?
Four hundred dollars?


507
00:45:47.472 --> 00:45:49.806
Are you guys kidding me?!
I don't have insurance.


508
00:45:49.808 --> 00:45:52.442
What happened to
affordable healthcare?


509
00:45:52.444 --> 00:45:54.944
You better get your supervisor,
you better find the president,


510
00:45:54.946 --> 00:45:58.915
somebody needs to come to this
counter and talk to me today
cause I'm not leavin'.


511
00:45:58.917 --> 00:46:01.885
Uh, ma'am, I'm, 
I'm just a temp.

512
00:46:01.887 --> 00:46:04.587
The receptionist will be
back sometime later.


513
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:06.556
She's at lunch right now.

514
00:46:08.726 --> 00:46:10.727
I need a doctor.

515
00:46:10.729 --> 00:46:11.895
I need a doctor.

516
00:46:11.897 --> 00:46:13.496
It's gonna be okay, buddy.

517
00:46:13.498 --> 00:46:15.398
Look at me,
you're gonna be fine. Okay?


518
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.600
I said I need a doctor!
Now!


519
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.738
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay, okay?


520
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.407
- Daddy!
- I got you.


521
00:46:24.409 --> 00:46:26.042
You're alright.
I'll be right here.


522
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.551
Don't worry, sir,
he's gonna be okay.


523
00:46:34.952 --> 00:46:36.653
I'm right here, son.

524
00:46:54.572 --> 00:46:56.773
This is standard procedure
every time we have
a gunshot victim.


525
00:46:56.775 --> 00:46:58.942
- Yeah.
- We need to...


526
00:46:58.944 --> 00:47:00.777
Make a report, you understand?

527
00:47:00.779 --> 00:47:01.778
Yeah, I understand.

528
00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:02.645
Let me start with
your first name,


529
00:47:02.647 --> 00:47:06.916
It's just company policy,
we have to get this report done.


530
00:47:06.918 --> 00:47:08.051
I know I understand
company policy,


531
00:47:08.053 --> 00:47:11.621
my son is down there,
he's been shot. Okay?


532
00:47:11.623 --> 00:47:12.956
Sir, at least let me
help you, okay?


533
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:14.157
I just need this for the report.

534
00:47:14.159 --> 00:47:15.658
Okay, okay. Alright, fine.
Go ahead.


535
00:47:16.661 --> 00:47:17.961
Security?

536
00:47:18.763 --> 00:47:19.929
Yes.

537
00:47:19.931 --> 00:47:22.599
- It's for you.
- It's for me?


538
00:47:24.602 --> 00:47:27.070
- Hello.
- Hey, Johnny.
How's little mark?


539
00:47:27.072 --> 00:47:29.172
Hold on a second.

540
00:47:29.174 --> 00:47:31.408
Hey, bud, it's my father.
He doesn't know about this yet.


541
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.743
Will you give me
a couple seconds? Please?


542
00:47:33.745 --> 00:47:36.746
- Sure, make it fast.
- I appreciate it.


543
00:47:36.748 --> 00:47:38.648
- Yeah.
- <i>- Johnny.</i>


544
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.117
Johnny. You know how
this ends, don't you?


545
00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:43.620
I did everything you asked me
to, what are you doing?


546
00:47:43.622 --> 00:47:46.689
Johnny be careful,
you don't want that guard
to hear too much.


547
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:49.592
Alright? It might be
hazardous to his health.


548
00:47:49.594 --> 00:47:52.629
You don't want his death on your
conscience now, too, do you?


549
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:54.697
Yeah. That's right.

550
00:47:54.699 --> 00:47:58.568
<i>Now, look,</i>
<i>you turn yourself over to us,</i>


551
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.538
then I let your family live.
This just ends, right now.


552
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.806
You touch my family
i swear to god I'm--


553
00:48:02.808 --> 00:48:07.010
<i>Your family's lives</i>
<i>are in your hands, not mine.</i>


554
00:48:07.012 --> 00:48:11.448
and your family can't afford
for you to get arrested.


555
00:48:12.683 --> 00:48:15.718
Now you take out that guard
and you take his cell.


556
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.820
<i>- Alright?</i>
- Yeah.


557
00:48:16.822 --> 00:48:18.555
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

558
00:48:19.023 --> 00:48:20.123
Ciao.

559
00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:22.058
No, he's gonna be fine, he..

560
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:25.829
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm here with him right now.


561
00:48:25.831 --> 00:48:28.832
And she knows. Yep.

562
00:48:29.667 --> 00:48:32.035
No, it's gonna be okay, dad.
I promise.


563
00:48:55.759 --> 00:48:58.761
Weston,
captain wants to see you.


564
00:49:24.922 --> 00:49:26.256
You wanted to see me, captain?

565
00:49:26.258 --> 00:49:27.957
Sit down.

566
00:49:29.093 --> 00:49:32.795
Your perp just hit the
number one most wanted list.


567

- Dead or alive?
- I don't care!

00:51:47.065 --> 00:51:51.901
I want everyone with a gun
and a badge after this shithead!


607
00:51:53.237 --> 00:51:55.738
Well, what are you waiting for?!

608
00:52:14.024 --> 00:52:16.025
Excuse me,
detective Weston with the pd.


609
00:52:16.027 --> 00:52:17.427
I'm looking for
the head of security.


610
00:52:54.364 --> 00:52:56.499
Someone's giving him orders.

611
00:53:53.323 --> 00:53:55.191
This is your fail safe.

612
00:53:59.062 --> 00:54:05.201
It's got everything about
the president, CIA, Marino,

613
00:54:05.203 --> 00:54:07.904
This is your get out of
jail free card, John.


614
00:54:19.983 --> 00:54:22.151
Modest storage for rent.

615
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:10.900
What the fuck does John niles
have that he needs to hide
in a storage unit?


616
00:55:20.377 --> 00:55:21.878
<i>LAPD.</i>

617
00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.579
Yeah, can you get me
through to the secret service?


618
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:24.647
<i>Please hold.</i>

619
00:55:24.649 --> 00:55:29.085
<i>- Yeah, this is Thompson.</i>
- Hello, detective Weston here.


620
00:55:29.087 --> 00:55:33.256
I'm investigating a case
that involves the prime suspect
in the presidential shooting.


621
00:55:33.258 --> 00:55:35.191
<i>What can I do for you,</i>
<i>detective?</i>


622
00:55:35.193 --> 00:55:38.027
Well, we just discovered
that John niles has acquired


623
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:40.396
a substantial amount of fire
power from a storage locker.


624
00:55:40.398 --> 00:55:42.398
<i>How is that possible</i>
<i>when he's on every agency's</i>


625
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.166
<i>and police force</i>
<i>most wanted list?</i>


626
00:55:44.168 --> 00:55:46.002
Listen, maybe you can
read about that in the report


627
00:55:46.004 --> 00:55:48.104
written by somebody who has
the time to write it,


628
00:55:48.106 --> 00:55:49.472
but right now
I'm more concerned about


629
00:55:49.474 --> 00:55:52.141
why he wants that fire power.

630
00:55:52.143 --> 00:55:54.176
You see, I haven't heard
anything in the news


631
00:55:54.178 --> 00:55:55.478
about the president's condition

632
00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.179
so I'm assuming
he's still alive,


633
00:55:57.181 --> 00:55:59.315
which worries me
that maybe John niles


634
00:55:59.317 --> 00:56:02.385
<i>His condition is classified</i>
<i>and I'll take what you said</i>


635
00:56:02.387 --> 00:56:05.621
<i>But rest assured that</i>
<i>the president has sufficient</i>


636
00:56:05.623 --> 00:56:08.291
<i>protection from both the secret</i>
<i>service and homeland security.</i>


637
00:56:08.293 --> 00:56:11.661
<i>We don't need city police</i>
<i>clouding the issue with</i>
<i>their theories and ideas.</i>


638
00:56:11.663 --> 00:56:14.163
Okay. You're right.

639
00:56:15.098 --> 00:56:16.399
President's already been shot

640
00:56:16.401 --> 00:56:18.601
and you guys have been
doing a fine job.


641
00:56:18.603 --> 00:56:20.303
Congratulations.

642
00:56:21.605 --> 00:56:23.973
These fucking assholes.

643
00:56:34.284 --> 00:56:36.419
- This is Pete.
<i>- Yeah, Pete, it's tom.</i>


644
00:56:36.421 --> 00:56:38.187
I meant to get
back to you earlier.


645
00:56:38.189 --> 00:56:41.190
You have any news on the victims
in the warehouse explosion?


646
00:56:41.192 --> 00:56:43.359
Listen, the explosion didn't
leave us much to work with.


647
00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:46.595
It's gonna take awhile
for the lab to piece together
anything from the remains.


648
00:56:46.597 --> 00:56:50.032
I ran the names that you gave me
and nothing came
back on our systems.


649
00:56:50.034 --> 00:56:53.235
<i>These guys are a little</i>
<i>too clean if you ask me.</i>


650
00:56:53.237 --> 00:56:55.404
Maybe you should try the CIA.

651
00:56:55.406 --> 00:56:57.606
You think these guys are spooks?

652
00:56:57.608 --> 00:56:59.308
I don't know what to think.

653
00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:02.144
Weston, I wish I could
but I don't have
access to their systems.


654
00:57:02.146 --> 00:57:05.114
Pete, you may have to break
a few laws, okay?


655
00:57:05.682 --> 00:57:07.650
Alright, man.
But you owe me.


656
00:57:08.518 --> 00:57:09.752
Thanks.

657
00:58:00.103 --> 00:58:01.303
Sir.

658
00:58:01.305 --> 00:58:03.406
Someone has got to find me
John niles.


659
00:58:03.408 --> 00:58:04.473
- Sir.
- What?


660
00:58:04.475 --> 00:58:05.508
Can't you see that I'm talking?

661
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:07.710
I think I got him.

662
00:58:22.426 --> 00:58:24.627
- I want this guy dead!
- Understood.


663
00:58:59.796 --> 00:59:02.131
Get up.

664
00:59:02.133 --> 00:59:03.332
Get up!

665
00:59:13.777 --> 00:59:15.377
We got a hit on our guy.

666
00:59:15.379 --> 00:59:17.513
We got a hit on niles from
two separate street cams.


667
00:59:17.515 --> 00:59:20.449
Fucking beautiful.
Finally, a break.


668
00:59:34.264 --> 00:59:36.866
Hun, run now!
To the broken window, go!


669
00:59:36.868 --> 00:59:39.535
Hurry up!
I'll meet you there.


670
00:59:39.537 --> 00:59:42.304
That was a pretty ballsy move.
Non-lethal shot.


671
00:59:42.306 --> 00:59:43.372
Well, maybe I was just rusty.

672
00:59:43.374 --> 00:59:46.475
You just guessed
there was a second shooter.


673
00:59:46.477 --> 00:59:48.277
But you've won nothing here,
John.


674
00:59:48.279 --> 00:59:50.412
This doesn't change
a fuckin' thing.


675
00:59:50.414 --> 00:59:51.780
Mission isn't complete.

676
01:00:04.461 --> 01:00:06.495
Let's go,
down the fire escape.


677
01:00:25.949 --> 01:00:27.516
Okay. Please take her.

678
01:00:27.518 --> 01:00:28.617
Take her into custody.

679
01:00:28.619 --> 01:00:30.319
Take her
into protective custody.


680
01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:31.620
I'll take care of this fuck.

681
01:00:31.622 --> 01:00:34.590
Come on, boss.
Let's go. Come on!


682
01:00:36.193 --> 01:00:37.426
Tough guy, huh?

683
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:04.553
John niles, I did that for your
own safety to make it look real.


684
01:01:04.555 --> 01:01:07.523
You're lucky someone didn't
shoot you dead back there.


685
01:01:07.525 --> 01:01:10.392
You really know how to ruin
a man's day, John.


686
01:01:10.394 --> 01:01:13.295
I spoke to forensics, it's gonna
take like a year to fill out


687
01:01:13.297 --> 01:01:15.264
the report of everything
that you've done.


688
01:01:15.266 --> 01:01:16.732
Yeah, well if they're lookin'
for the answers
they'll find 'em.


689
01:01:16.734 --> 01:01:19.468
The truth is out there.
I just draw attention to it.


690
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:24.640
but another man might say that
the guy who shot the president


691
01:01:24.642 --> 01:01:26.575
decided to go to war
with the CIA.


692
01:01:26.577 --> 01:01:28.811
My family's okay.
That's what matters.


693
01:01:28.813 --> 01:01:30.613
I need 24-hour
protection on them.


694
01:01:30.615 --> 01:01:32.715
That includes mark,
in the hospital, you understand?


695
01:01:32.717 --> 01:01:35.484
I already, I already
got a man at the hospital.


696
01:01:35.486 --> 01:01:38.020
But I doubt you're gonna be
able to talk your way out of


697
01:01:38.022 --> 01:01:40.256
all the shit you've done today.

698
01:01:41.424 --> 01:01:41.425
Now I spoke to the doctor

699
01:01:41.425 --> 01:01:45.261
he said your son's out of
surgery. He's gonna be okay.


700
01:01:45.263 --> 01:01:46.462
Thank you.

701
01:01:51.468 --> 01:01:53.035
<i>This is unit 3-4-2-1,</i>

702
01:01:53.037 --> 01:01:56.505
<i>president is out of surgery</i>
<i>and is stable.</i>


703
01:01:56.507 --> 01:01:59.541
<i>Please dispatch all available</i>
<i>units to the hospital now.</i>


704
01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:03.512
- So he's not dead.
- No, he's not dead.


705
01:02:03.514 --> 01:02:05.781
Because I'm a soldier,
not an assassin.


706
01:02:05.783 --> 01:02:07.583
But he's lucky it was me
on that roof.


707
01:02:07.585 --> 01:02:09.852
Otherwise he would be dead.

708
01:02:09.854 --> 01:02:11.954
That'd be pretty hard to prove.

709
01:02:11.956 --> 01:02:14.523
Yeah. Why don't you come
look at my pocket.


710
01:02:14.525 --> 01:02:16.558
Maybe that'll help you
out a little bit.


711
01:02:20.897 --> 01:02:23.399
Been working
with homeland security.


712
01:02:42.986 --> 01:02:45.454
Time to set
the dogs on Mr. niles.


713
01:02:45.456 --> 01:02:48.324
<i>Once niles is dead,</i>
<i>we move forward.</i>


714
01:02:48.326 --> 01:02:50.459
<i>The president</i>
<i>doesn't leave alive.</i>


715
01:03:00.937 --> 01:03:02.838
Listen to me,
something's not right.


716
01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:07.576
It's a road work.
They're workin' on
the fuckin' road. Calm down.


717
01:03:07.578 --> 01:03:10.079
I'm telling you,
it's not road work.


718
01:03:18.655 --> 01:03:20.622
Hey, come on, guys.

719
01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:24.426
Pd. You gotta let us through.

720
01:03:24.428 --> 01:03:26.428
Hey, just let us make some room.

721
01:03:35.438 --> 01:03:36.505
Weston!

722
01:03:36.507 --> 01:03:38.874
Weston! Weston! Weston!

723
01:03:38.876 --> 01:03:40.743
- Hey!
- - Weston!


724
01:05:06.529 --> 01:05:07.963
It's about time.

725
01:05:08.698 --> 01:05:10.632
Hey.

726
01:05:10.634 --> 01:05:11.834
I was shot.

727
01:05:14.103 --> 01:05:15.904
But you're wearin' a vest.

728
01:05:16.706 --> 01:05:18.507
It still hurts.

729
01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:46.101
I should've went in the FBI.

730
01:05:46.103 --> 01:05:47.836
They got better body armor.

731
01:05:47.838 --> 01:05:49.238
I take it you believe me then.

732
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.840
I believe they wanted him
to take you alive, John.


733
01:05:51.842 --> 01:05:52.875
So what's your play?

734
01:05:52.877 --> 01:05:54.676
Go to the hospital, save my son.

735
01:05:54.678 --> 01:05:56.245
Stop 'em killin' the president.
That's the play.


736
01:05:56.247 --> 01:05:59.781
You kill every treasonous,
cop killing bastard
along the way.


737
01:05:59.783 --> 01:06:01.216
Only one problem with that.

738
01:06:01.218 --> 01:06:03.252
My face is plastered
all over the news.


739
01:06:03.254 --> 01:06:04.753
Can't just
walk through the front doors.


740
01:06:04.755 --> 01:06:06.555
I got it. I got it.

741
01:06:12.196 --> 01:06:16.231
Mike, you still got that
relative in the fire department?


742
01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:19.968
Weston, we just got word from
the secret service director.


743
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:22.070
They're moving
the president today.


744
01:06:22.072 --> 01:06:24.540
That means
it's David's last chance.


745
01:06:24.542 --> 01:06:28.911
Once the president gets
on air force 1 and lands in DC,
he's untouchable.


746
01:06:28.913 --> 01:06:31.613
Shit, the only window
they have to get him


747
01:06:31.615 --> 01:06:36.552
Nah. Security's
way too tight on his floor.
They'll never get to him.


748
01:06:36.554 --> 01:06:38.720
Maybe they don't have to
actually have to get to him.


749
01:06:38.722 --> 01:06:39.855
What do you mean?

750
01:06:39.857 --> 01:06:41.857
Maybe they just have to
get close to him.


751
01:06:42.892 --> 01:06:46.828
- What floor is he on again?
- Same as your son.


752
01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:50.165
Shit come on, let's get ready.
Put you under. Put your feet up.


753
01:06:50.167 --> 01:06:51.600
Slow down.

754
01:07:00.043 --> 01:07:02.277
- Careful.
- Alright, get the end.


755
01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:03.979
Ready?

756
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:08.817
Excuse me.

757
01:07:08.819 --> 01:07:11.186
Yeah, I'm detective Weston,
LAPD.


758
01:07:11.188 --> 01:07:14.656
We got a prisoner here.
I gotta get him checked out
before I take him upstate.


759
01:07:14.658 --> 01:07:15.991
Can you help me out?

760
01:07:18.928 --> 01:07:20.295
Right this way.

761
01:07:31.941 --> 01:07:35.177
Okay, so we'll put him
here in room a for now.


762
01:07:35.179 --> 01:07:37.913
And we'll send in a doctor
as soon as we have one ready.


763
01:07:47.223 --> 01:07:48.957
Alright, come on, come on.

764
01:07:51.127 --> 01:07:53.028
Ma'am, excuse us, please.

765
01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:54.963
President's on the next floor.
Let's go.


766
01:07:54.965 --> 01:07:56.264
Get down.

767
01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.774
Move.

768
01:08:08.879 --> 01:08:10.712
Shit!

769
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.980
Fire alarm.

770
01:08:11.982 --> 01:08:16.318
You guys split up;
See if you can find
another way off this floor.


771
01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.954
- Yes, sir. Copy that.
- Let's go let's go.


772
01:08:39.409 --> 01:08:41.910
Shit, fire alarm.
Get to the stairwell, go.


773
01:08:41.912 --> 01:08:43.945
This is Thompson 1-5
with the president,


774
01:08:43.947 --> 01:08:45.380
fire alarms goin' off.

775
01:08:54.457 --> 01:08:56.158
Secure the room right now,
secure the whole floor,


776
01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.726
send me five more agents.

777
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.831
<i>Potus is secure.</i>

778
01:09:23.119 --> 01:09:24.920
End of the hall.

779
01:09:26.956 --> 01:09:27.956
Move!

780
01:09:40.103 --> 01:09:43.138
- I'm callin' backup!
- <i>911, what is your emergency?</i>


781
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:47.476
We are under attack.
We're at the St. rose hospital.


782
01:09:47.478 --> 01:09:50.112
Send backups.
Send everything fucking
thing you have.


783
01:09:50.114 --> 01:09:52.247
Regard every fucking agent is--

784
01:09:53.516 --> 01:09:55.217
fuck!

785
01:09:55.219 --> 01:09:57.385
Fuck this,
I'm waiting for backup.


786
01:09:57.387 --> 01:10:00.021
Theirs or yours?
If I get to the president first
at least we have some hope.


787
01:10:00.023 --> 01:10:01.923
- You're sure of that?
- Here's what I am sure of:


788
01:10:01.925 --> 01:10:07.496
Because you know what?
To the untrained eye, it looks
like we're shootin' our way in!


789
01:10:08.431 --> 01:10:10.932
You're not making me feel
very safe, John.


790
01:10:23.179 --> 01:10:25.247
- Hey. You okay?
- Hey.


791
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:29.985
I was shot twice in one day,
John, go fuck yourself.


792
01:10:29.987 --> 01:10:31.219
- You'll live.
- What are you waiting for?


793
01:10:31.221 --> 01:10:33.088
Go get the motherfucker.

794
01:10:35.925 --> 01:10:37.392
Ah, fuck.

795
01:10:39.428 --> 01:10:41.396
- Hey, fucker.
- Back off, Johnny!


796
01:10:41.398 --> 01:10:43.265
Hold it right there, pal.

797
01:10:48.004 --> 01:10:49.938
Pullin' that fire alarm
was a nice touch.


798
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:51.206
I didn't expect that.

799
01:10:51.208 --> 01:10:52.874
But now you're
stuck in here with me.


800
01:10:52.876 --> 01:10:54.176
This is the detonator.

801
01:10:54.178 --> 01:10:56.077
And your car is packed
with enough semtex


802
01:10:56.079 --> 01:10:57.946
to blow up
this place to fuckin' hell.


803
01:10:57.948 --> 01:10:59.948
So let me tell you how
tomorrow's headline's
gonna play out.


804
01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:02.551
- Please do.
- After his botched attempt
on the life of the president,


805
01:11:02.553 --> 01:11:04.319
John niles went on
a killing spree,


806
01:11:04.321 --> 01:11:07.055
which included several CIA
agents, secret servicemen


807
01:11:07.057 --> 01:11:08.824
and local law
enforcement personnel.


808
01:11:08.826 --> 01:11:12.093
Niles then returned to the
hospital on a suicide mission,


809
01:11:12.095 --> 01:11:14.563
intent on
killing himself, his son,


810
01:11:14.565 --> 01:11:16.565
and the president
of the United States.


811
01:11:16.567 --> 01:11:18.200
A suicide bomber?
That's your plan b?


812
01:11:18.202 --> 01:11:21.002
Sometimes a great sacrifice
is necessary.


813
01:11:21.004 --> 01:11:22.237
And you know what?

814
01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:25.473
You're still the patsy
and I'm gonna die a hero!


815
01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:02.611
- Hold that.
- Hm...


816
01:12:02.613 --> 01:12:08.251
Got it?

817
01:12:08.251 --> 01:12:10.185
Hey, what are you
doing over there, bud?


818
01:12:12.188 --> 01:12:14.155
Huh?

819
01:12:14.157 --> 01:12:16.224
I think we got a little
Picasso on our hands, hun.


820
01:12:16.226 --> 01:12:18.193
Let me see.

821
01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:24.266
Daddy kick bad guy butt.

822
01:12:25.201 --> 01:12:28.470
Yeah, daddy's definitely
kicking bad guy butt.


823
01:12:28.472 --> 01:12:31.539
- Wow.
- What did you say?


824
01:12:31.541 --> 01:12:33.208
Daddy kicking bad guy butt.

825
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:35.143
- Yeah.
- Wow.


826
01:12:35.145 --> 01:12:36.478
You know he's your son.

827
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.980
No, no, no, he actually
comes from your loins.


828
01:12:38.982 --> 01:12:40.181
That's correct.

829
01:12:42.652 --> 01:12:44.486
You know what I think
we should do?


830
01:12:44.488 --> 01:12:49.958
I think we should take these
two pictures of daddy's, um,
butt kicking.


831
01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.227
- Yeah.
- And put them
in a very special place,


832
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:54.963
and then we'll take this picture
and put it on the fridge.


833
01:12:54.965 --> 01:12:57.132
Nah, I think we should do this
one on the fridge.


834
01:12:57.134 --> 01:12:58.233
- Yeah.
- Special place.


835
01:12:58.235 --> 01:13:00.168
Yeah, okay.

836
01:13:01.203 --> 01:13:03.939
So I'm just gonna take
these two right here


837
01:13:03.941 --> 01:13:05.407
and then let's take this
one over to the fridge.


838
01:13:05.409 --> 01:13:08.510
- Good job, bud.
- Very good job.


839
01:13:08.512 --> 01:13:09.945
Yes.

840
01:13:15.284 --> 01:13:16.284
Hi, price.

841
01:13:17.486 --> 01:13:20.155
Turn the TV on.
Channel seven.


842
01:13:20.157 --> 01:13:22.325
Channel seven?

843
01:13:22.325 --> 01:13:24.292
<i>Good morning America.</i>

844
01:13:24.294 --> 01:13:26.661
<i>Today we are here</i>
<i>to honor two men.</i>


845
01:13:26.663 --> 01:13:31.566
<i>Who have not only demonstrated</i>
<i>great strength of character</i>
<i>but remarkable bravery.</i>


846
01:13:31.568 --> 01:13:34.602
<i>They're willingness to put</i>
<i>their lives on the line</i>


847
01:13:34.604 --> 01:13:37.605
<i>and in harm's way,</i>
<i>to save my life</i>


848
01:13:37.607 --> 01:13:41.142
<i>and the lives of hundreds</i>
<i>of Americans by preventing</i>


849
01:13:41.144 --> 01:13:43.178
<i>a terrorist attack</i>
<i>on American soil</i>


850
01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.447
<i>is nothing</i>
<i>short of inspiring.</i>


851
01:13:45.449 --> 01:13:47.649
Our guy Weston's looking
pretty photogenic.


852
01:13:47.651 --> 01:13:49.484
After you gave him
all the credit.


853
01:13:49.486 --> 01:13:51.753
Well, they couldn't exactly put
a medal on you for shooting


854
01:13:51.755 --> 01:13:53.321
the president, could they?

855
01:13:53.323 --> 01:13:55.223
Besides, you two
are a good team.


856
01:13:55.225 --> 01:13:56.658
<i>By the way, there are only</i>
<i>three people in the world</i>


857
01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:58.193
<i>that could take that shot.</i>

858
01:13:58.195 --> 01:14:00.295
President should be grateful
that I was one of 'em.


859
01:14:00.297 --> 01:14:02.464
And I'm the one that should be
getting the medal here.


860
01:14:02.466 --> 01:14:05.300
You know how much shrapnel I'm
pullin' out of my ass right now?


861
01:14:05.302 --> 01:14:08.370
Yeah, you bored
at your day job yet?


862
01:14:09.372 --> 01:14:12.674
Oh, no.
I'm not bored at all.


863
01:14:13.676 --> 01:14:15.410
I got something
a little bit special


864
01:14:15.412 --> 01:14:17.345
could use your expertise.

865
01:14:17.347 --> 01:14:18.747
<i>Okay, let me guess.</i>

866
01:14:18.749 --> 01:14:20.415
So you can give all
the credit away, right?


867
01:14:20.417 --> 01:14:21.549
<i>Absolutely.</i>

868
01:14:23.053 --> 01:14:24.686
At least tell me
you'll think about it.


869
01:14:24.688 --> 01:14:27.322
Okay, thanks for nothin'.

870
01:14:30.327 --> 01:14:33.261
Alright, I'll talk to you.

871
01:14:36.432 --> 01:14:38.199
Looks great.

872
01:14:40.603 --> 01:14:42.270
Perfect.

873
01:14:42.272 --> 01:14:45.306
I still like daddy
kill bad guy look.


874
01:14:48.444 --> 01:14:51.312
<i>I'd like to introduce</i>
<i>to you, America,</i>


875
01:14:51.314 --> 01:14:55.050
<i>captain Jake Barlow</i>
<i>and detective Thomas Weston.</i>


876
01:14:55.052 --> 01:14:58.420
<i>Two true Americans.</i>

877
01:14:58.422 --> 01:15:01.122
<i>Thank you, Mr. president.</i>
<i>Just doin' my job.</i>


878
01:15:01.124 --> 01:15:03.425
<i>- Thank you, Mr. president.</i>
<i>- Thank you, sir.</i>


879
01:15:03.427 --> 01:15:05.827
<i>We are just glad</i>
<i>that we could be</i>


880
01:15:05.829 --> 01:15:08.263

<i>And remember,</i>
<i>Barlow for mayor 2016.</i>


883
01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.775
<i>There you have it,</i>

884
01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:26.314
<i>May god bless you, and may</i>
