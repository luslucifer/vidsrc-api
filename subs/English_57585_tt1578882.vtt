1
00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:18.581
Come on, come on, come on.

2
00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.290
Shit.

3
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.456
Don't look at me.
This guy's the one who shot you.


4
00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:12.331
Hey.

5
00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:07.497
Six men.

6
00:05:07.497 --> 00:05:09.081
Ten grand a head. 
Sixty thousand.

7
00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:15.914
Wherever my daughter's spirit is,
I hope she's a little happier.


8
00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:19.831
I thought I would feel better, but--

9
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:21.622
somehow--

10
00:05:25.082 --> 00:05:26.956
That's my little girl.

11
00:05:26.956 --> 00:05:28.539
They turned her into an addict.

12
00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.414
I saw her body
and it was hard to recognize.


13
00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:34.581
I keep thinking she's still alive.

14
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.165
# Let's go Put some
sake in my cup #

15
00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:44.998
# Fill it up Fill it up #

16
00:05:44.998 --> 00:05:48.998
# Put some sake in my cup
Fill it up Fill it up #


17
00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:18.123
You deserve to lose.

18
00:06:18.123 --> 00:06:19.831
Watching me instead of looking

19
00:06:19.831 --> 00:06:22.456
at all that beautiful Siamese
kitty cat out there.


20
00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:24.330
Boss, problem with the check.

21
00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:54.330
English. Why you running?

22
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.123
because I know why you're here.

23
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.831
I just need a favor.

24
00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:11.289
Wait. Just hear me out.

25
00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:12.372
Forget it.

26
00:07:43.665 --> 00:07:45.456
Oh, no. Not now.

27
00:08:00.874 --> 00:08:02.247
Hey.

28
00:08:08.582 --> 00:08:09.831
Get off my car.

29
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.706
Moron. You want it?

30
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:21.581
Look, I have a gun.

31
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:23.789
You'd already be dead if
I was here to kill you.


32
00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:25.789
You want to ask me questions first.

33
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.081
Hey. Hey.

34
00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:29.748
How do you even think that
shit about me?


35
00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:33.289
They always send--

36
00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.539
someone you know.

37
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.706
I am on a job here.
And you're not it.


38
00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:39.622
I just need some weapons.

39
00:08:39.622 --> 00:08:43.205
Why didn't you say so?

40
00:08:43.205 --> 00:08:48.497
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You know, this is Versace.


41
00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:50.664
It's not a knockoff, either.

42
00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:55.247
Do you know what it
is to get Versace into Thailand?


43
00:08:55.247 --> 00:08:57.664
Is that my button?

44
00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:02.706
I think all them titties are
going to your head.


45
00:09:02.706 --> 00:09:04.330
What could you possibly know
that would bring....


46
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.914
that kind of heat from the agency?

47
00:09:05.914 --> 00:09:09.748
You know that I was deep cover.

48
00:09:09.748 --> 00:09:13.122
I was too deep for them to take
responsibility....


49
00:09:13.122 --> 00:09:15.664
...once it was blown to fucks.

50
00:09:15.664 --> 00:09:17.330
So what about you?

51
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
If you're not here for me,
then what's the job?


52
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.831
Are you working for the agency
or are you moonlighting?


53
00:09:23.831 --> 00:09:26.247
A guy lost his
daughter to a few punks.

54
00:09:26.247 --> 00:09:27.330
They put her to work.

55
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.247
Bullshit.

56
00:09:29.247 --> 00:09:31.664
What would have you slumming
in with the likes of that?


57
00:09:31.664 --> 00:09:33.831
He's paying the rate.

58
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:35.622
Okay, fine. Here.

59
00:09:35.622 --> 00:09:39.164
Oh, fuck. I fucking knew it.

60
00:09:39.164 --> 00:09:40.413
Here.

61
00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:44.831
Okay. Maybe I was mistaken.

62
00:09:44.831 --> 00:09:49.039
You know,
I have been a bit tense lately.


63
00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:51.330
I don't know what came over me.

64
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
Here. We're tight.

65
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.831
No. You hold onto it.

66
00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:58.122
No, no. Never carry a gun.

67
00:09:58.122 --> 00:09:59.831
People get shot that way.

68
00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:01.789
Good point coming from you.

69
00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:03.164
Precisely.

70
00:10:03.164 --> 00:10:06.247
You sure living here's been
good for you? Huh?


71
00:10:06.247 --> 00:10:08.247
It's paradise.

72
00:10:30.707 --> 00:10:32.414
Whoa. Who's that?

73
00:10:32.414 --> 00:10:35.289
Relax. Only guy I can trust.

74
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:48.080
I have got to
do something with my hair.

75
00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:57.289
This is where the magic happens.

76
00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:11.247
Right this way. Welcome...

77
00:11:11.247 --> 00:11:13.706
to my little slice of heaven.

78
00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.581
Oh, this might become handy.

79
00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:17.080
No, no. Sorry, sorry.

80
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.289
Wrong section. Not for rent.

81
00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:21.456
Not just any M76.

82
00:11:21.456 --> 00:11:23.956
That was used by
Lee Marvin in Prime Cut.

83
00:11:23.956 --> 00:11:25.456
He shot Gene Hackman with it

84
00:11:25.456 --> 00:11:27.706
and I have got
the papers to prove it.

85
00:11:27.706 --> 00:11:30.831
I am starting my own Planet Hollywood
here. But all guns.


86
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:32.706
It's genius. Right?

87
00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:34.664
You ever hear of Pretty Boy Floyd?

88
00:11:34.664 --> 00:11:37.164
Not the bank robber. The movie.

89
00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:40.330
This is the first piece I grabbed.

90
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.955
This M1 was used by Clint himself
in Pink Cadillac.


91
00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:48.122
Grease gun. Charlie Bronson.
Dirty Dozen.


92
00:11:48.122 --> 00:11:50.789
I know, it's a franchise, right.

93
00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:51.997
I am going legit.

94
00:11:51.997 --> 00:11:54.414
All I need is a name.

95
00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.664
I was thinking, you know, CafÄ‚Â© AK.

96
00:11:56.664 --> 00:11:59.748
Or Guns Zone. Like Fun Zone.

97
00:11:59.748 --> 00:12:03.205
But Gun Zone. Uh huh?

98
00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:05.581
Well, I need something long.
Working from a distance.


99
00:12:05.581 --> 00:12:09.497
Accuracy international. Real light.

100
00:12:09.497 --> 00:12:13.414
That will do you.
It's a thousand a day.


101
00:12:13.414 --> 00:12:15.205
That's the buddy rate.

102
00:12:21.582 --> 00:12:22.748
You got a suppressor for this?

103
00:12:22.748 --> 00:12:24.164
No. Not for that.

104
00:12:24.164 --> 00:12:25.873
What about a scope, 30 times?

105
00:12:25.873 --> 00:12:29.622
You trying to hit something in Cambodia?
Uh, 15.


106
00:12:29.622 --> 00:12:34.581
Best I can do.
But I will throw in night vision.


107
00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:48.997
How much for this?

108
00:12:48.997 --> 00:12:50.539
You golf?

109
00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:55.080
You know,
even if you find this guy's daughter


110
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.414
they make them all addicts
so they won't leave.


111
00:12:59.414 --> 00:13:00.664
And it's one needle for everybody.

112
00:13:00.664 --> 00:13:03.497
I already found her.

113
00:13:03.497 --> 00:13:07.456
Whoa. Feel that?

114
00:13:07.456 --> 00:13:10.872
Fucking chill just went through me.

115
00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:16.080
So, where you staying?

116
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.080
Wouldn't you like to know.

117
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.456
Got to be careful.
This whole city's haunted.


118
00:13:21.456 --> 00:13:25.080
There's a lot of unhappy spirits
looking for you.


119
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.831
There's going to be a lot more.

120
00:15:17.748 --> 00:15:19.955
Initiation of a monk.

121
00:15:23.415 --> 00:15:25.080
What are you doing here?

122
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.830
I tried to follow you.

123
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.872
Why?

124
00:15:27.872 --> 00:15:30.497
I don't know yet.

125
00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:31.997
Are you alone?

126
00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:34.497
Yes. I couldn't keep up with you.

127
00:15:34.497 --> 00:15:37.205
Then I followed the sound of the chanting.

128
00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:38.747
And you were here.

129
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:42.997
It's not a coincidence.

130
00:15:42.997 --> 00:15:44.747
It was meant to
be that I find you.

131
00:15:44.747 --> 00:15:47.830
You shouldn't have followed me.

132
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.456
It's okay. It's okay.

133
00:15:50.456 --> 00:15:53.038
Do it. Do it.

134
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.330
I won't leave.

135
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.997
I have seen your tracks.

136
00:16:05.997 --> 00:16:08.539
Know you will be trying soon enough.

137
00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:14.913
Open your mouth.

138
00:16:58.706 --> 00:17:02.788
Heroin withdrawal. It will pass.

139
00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:05.497
Please let me go.

140
00:17:05.497 --> 00:17:07.038
I need to go back.

141
00:17:07.038 --> 00:17:08.414
I will do whatever you want.

142
00:17:08.414 --> 00:17:11.497
I will love you. I will.

143
00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:20.372
You will feel better when it's over.

144
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.414
Come here. Time to get up.

145
00:19:08.415 --> 00:19:09.414
Good?

146
00:19:11.123 --> 00:19:14.038
There's water there for you to clean up.

147
00:19:14.038 --> 00:19:15.538
Here.

148
00:19:31.415 --> 00:19:33.663
You will kill me for following you?

149
00:19:33.663 --> 00:19:36.080
No. For knowing where I am staying.

150
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.496
Why is it important you stay here?

151
00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:46.663
Why didn't you do it?

152
00:19:46.663 --> 00:19:48.913
Because you said it was okay.

153
00:19:48.913 --> 00:19:49.632
It is.

154
00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:55.830
Nothing's ever that bad to want
to give up on life.


155
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.830
I didn't see it as an escape.

156
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.372
It was all right for other reasons.
Jai yen.


157
00:20:01.372 --> 00:20:04.080
I am comfortable with whatever comes.

158
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.247
The settlement for past wrongs.

159
00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:07.997
Then why not just stay there
and settle up....


160
00:20:07.997 --> 00:20:09.496
...instead of following me?

161
00:20:09.496 --> 00:20:12.663
You were sent because my time
there was finished.


162
00:20:12.663 --> 00:20:15.372
Shh. Come here.

163
00:20:26.248 --> 00:20:29.705
Now you stay there and be quiet.

164
00:20:29.705 --> 00:20:33.164
My name is Mae. 
What is yours?

165
00:20:37.914 --> 00:20:40.413
I have to get some sleep.

166
00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:42.621
You're going to watch that
club down there....


167
00:20:42.621 --> 00:20:44.164
...for the guys who had you.

168
00:20:44.164 --> 00:20:46.788
That is not their club.

169
00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.372
I know.
But they will be showing up there anyway.


170
00:20:49.372 --> 00:20:50.830
Because you made it look like

171
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.830
one of the guys from the club
just attacked them.


172
00:20:58.581 --> 00:21:00.788
Wake me up when
you see somebody you know.

173
00:21:00.788 --> 00:21:03.122
I can't help you kill anyone.

174
00:21:03.122 --> 00:21:04.913
You will.

175
00:21:04.913 --> 00:21:06.705
Why do you kill them?

176
00:21:06.705 --> 00:21:09.122
Why do you think?

177
00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:11.413
Because they're hurting people.

178
00:21:43.165 --> 00:21:45.205
Don't. You have to stop.

179
00:21:45.205 --> 00:21:46.913
This is wrong.

180
00:21:54.497 --> 00:21:55.538
Shhh.

181
00:21:59.165 --> 00:22:00.247
Shut up.

182
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:18.413
Thanks for the help.

183
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.080
I need to know the other places

184
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.747
where they take you girls.

185
00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:33.621
I don't understand why you won't help me.

186
00:24:33.621 --> 00:24:36.329
It is always wrong to kill.

187
00:24:36.329 --> 00:24:38.163
It is possible the people you shoot

188
00:24:38.163 --> 00:24:39.747
might become better people.

189
00:24:42.456 --> 00:24:47.204
Maybe I can persuade you.

190
00:24:47.204 --> 00:24:49.080
No. It is forbidden.

191
00:24:52.247 --> 00:24:53.496
If killing is always wrong

192
00:24:53.496 --> 00:24:55.329
then I get the same points against me

193
00:24:55.329 --> 00:24:56.621
for a holy man as a pimp.

194
00:24:56.621 --> 00:24:58.038
The only choice you have here is

195
00:24:58.038 --> 00:24:59.621
whether you will be part
of getting him killed....


196
00:24:59.621 --> 00:25:02.455
...or the guys who had you.

197
00:25:02.455 --> 00:25:05.038
Okay. I will take you to them.

198
00:25:08.247 --> 00:25:09.872
If you won't tell me your name

199
00:25:09.872 --> 00:25:12.329
please tell me the month and day
of your birth.


200
00:25:12.329 --> 00:25:15.788
Your luck today may depend on it.

201
00:25:15.788 --> 00:25:17.788
You can wear colors which may help.

202
00:25:17.788 --> 00:25:21.246
That's not the kind of help
I am looking for.


203
00:25:21.246 --> 00:25:22.997
I make my own luck.

204
00:25:28.956 --> 00:25:30.580
Why do you talk like a monk?

205
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.371
A long time ago, 
I joined them.

206
00:25:32.371 --> 00:25:33.496
To escape those pimps?

207
00:25:33.496 --> 00:25:36.371
No, my father sold me.

208
00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:40.538
This is it.

209
00:25:43.831 --> 00:25:45.830
Why would they bring anyone here?

210
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.830
To get rid of them.

211
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.371
There's one right there.

212
00:25:51.706 --> 00:25:56.621
May Ying. She loved to sing.

213
00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.788
You misunderstood me.

214
00:25:58.788 --> 00:26:03.830
I want to know where else they
had you working. Working.


215
00:26:07.831 --> 00:26:10.788
This is one place.

216
00:26:10.788 --> 00:26:11.997
Wow.

217
00:26:11.997 --> 00:26:15.455
You look troubled.

218
00:26:15.455 --> 00:26:17.913
Well,
I didn't think there'd be as many.


219
00:26:17.913 --> 00:26:21.163
Or this organized.

220
00:26:21.163 --> 00:26:25.663
So will we stop this and leave?

221
00:26:25.663 --> 00:26:28.455
You're going to have to tell
me everything you know.


222
00:26:28.455 --> 00:26:31.955
Eleven more? Seems like a lot.

223
00:26:31.955 --> 00:26:33.496
I will take your word for it.

224
00:26:33.496 --> 00:26:35.079
Must be all of them.

225
00:26:37.748 --> 00:26:39.079
What are you doing?

226
00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:40.997
Chang Kao.

227
00:26:40.997 --> 00:26:43.037
Oh, my God.

228
00:26:43.037 --> 00:26:44.830
Do they know who you are?

229
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.455
If they find out,
they're going to kill me.


230
00:26:47.455 --> 00:26:50.079
Hey, listen,
I am sorry to have involved you in this.


231
00:26:50.079 --> 00:26:52.413
But we can walk away from this, right?

232
00:26:52.413 --> 00:26:55.329
Maybe they don't know who you are.

233
00:26:55.329 --> 00:26:57.788
I won't say anything
if they come to me.

234
00:26:57.788 --> 00:26:59.705
I will just keep going.

235
00:26:59.705 --> 00:27:01.997
I don't want you to. I am out.

236
00:27:01.997 --> 00:27:06.705
The deal was all of them.
You're out when it's done.


237
00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.663
Put some ice on that shit.

238
00:27:10.663 --> 00:27:12.037
You hear me? I am out.

239
00:27:13.664 --> 00:27:14.997
Hi.

240
00:27:14.997 --> 00:27:17.329
I told you to wait downstairs.
Come on.


241
00:27:17.329 --> 00:27:19.621
And I told you I'd help.

242
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:21.204
You talk back, too.

243
00:27:21.204 --> 00:27:23.037
It's time you learned to behave.

244
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.830
Hm?

245
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.455
What does a painted elephant mean?

246
00:28:00.455 --> 00:28:04.079
It's not paint.
It's naturally white.


247
00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:09.204
Buddha's mother dreamed a white elephant

248
00:28:09.204 --> 00:28:10.621
gave her a lotus flower three nights

249
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:13.037
before she gave birth to him.

250
00:28:13.037 --> 00:28:16.163
And so he's there for a truce.

251
00:28:16.163 --> 00:28:18.455
Nobody will risk hitting him.

252
00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:21.954
I am happy that you have decided
to stay here and continue.


253
00:28:21.954 --> 00:28:26.872
Not what you would normally do, is it?

254
00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:28.913
It will mix up what comes for you.

255
00:29:28.913 --> 00:29:30.246
Hey, Jimmy here?

256
00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:32.954
No, no, no, no.

257
00:29:32.954 --> 00:29:34.538
Okay, okay, okay.

258
00:29:44.913 --> 00:29:46.204
Get out.

259
00:29:47.456 --> 00:29:50.996
Wait, no. Not you.

260
00:29:50.996 --> 00:29:52.621
Did you happen to notice

261
00:29:52.621 --> 00:29:56.329
that the girls were mostly
naked when you came in?


262
00:29:56.329 --> 00:29:58.912
Are those lovely breasts any clue

263
00:29:58.912 --> 00:30:03.037
as to who in this city might
allow me to operate here?


264
00:30:03.037 --> 00:30:05.580
It's the same gang you're shooting at.

265
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.496
Do I have to tell you what happens
if Bhun realizes....


266
00:30:08.496 --> 00:30:11.829
....that you're using my
specialized weaponry to do it?


267
00:30:11.829 --> 00:30:13.912
I didn't know who I was up against.

268
00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:15.496
Well, you do now.

269
00:30:15.496 --> 00:30:18.163
Does the guy that hired you
know who he's fucking with?


270
00:30:18.163 --> 00:30:19.455
He fired me.

271
00:30:19.455 --> 00:30:23.079
Oh, perfect.
Well, no need to apologize.


272
00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:26.663
Just stay as far away from me as--

273
00:30:29.913 --> 00:30:31.871
Where's the gun?

274
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.621
Why bring the bag and no gun?

275
00:30:33.621 --> 00:30:35.747
I needed to carry another one.

276
00:30:35.747 --> 00:30:36.788
That's funny.

277
00:30:36.788 --> 00:30:38.371
Only you're never funny.

278
00:30:38.371 --> 00:30:40.455
You're dark.

279
00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:43.829
And I don't mean skin tone.

280
00:30:43.829 --> 00:30:48.163
Remember what you said to me
last time I saw you?


281
00:30:48.163 --> 00:30:49.912
"That's twice you saved my life."

282
00:30:49.912 --> 00:30:52.079
No. There was a time before that.

283
00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:56.079
Hmmm. "I swear I will get this
cash back to you."


284
00:30:56.079 --> 00:30:57.747
No, that was even further back.

285
00:30:57.747 --> 00:30:59.747
"Take your hands off of me,
I don't go that way."


286
00:31:00.913 --> 00:31:01.996
You owe me.

287
00:31:01.996 --> 00:31:04.163
Another life.

288
00:31:04.163 --> 00:31:07.538
I don't owe anybody anything
from back then.


289
00:31:16.414 --> 00:31:17.787
Oh, fuck me.

290
00:31:24.122 --> 00:31:27.371
Go see this guy.
They call him the Thai Stick.


291
00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:32.329
Why are you doing this?

292
00:31:32.329 --> 00:31:33.746
They're hurting people.

293
00:31:37.122 --> 00:31:38.663
"They're hurting people."

294
00:31:41.122 --> 00:31:43.746
Christ. Even you're smiling.

295
00:31:43.746 --> 00:31:47.663
And you don't smile.

296
00:31:47.663 --> 00:31:49.912
You owe me.

297
00:31:49.912 --> 00:31:52.371
Now, I have seen the cigar room.

298
00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:53.912
Must be a place in that warehouse

299
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:55.163
where you keep the Cubans.

300
00:31:55.163 --> 00:31:57.246
Yeah.

301
00:32:05.247 --> 00:32:07.288
The Cubans aren't in the warehouse.

302
00:32:33.247 --> 00:32:35.413
Welcome to my humidor.

303
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.996
I suppose you don't need...

304
00:32:46.996 --> 00:32:47.745
No.

305
00:32:48.872 --> 00:32:53.329
Colt, M4 sniper. HK PSG-1.

306
00:32:53.329 --> 00:32:56.163
Anything in a bigger caliber?

307
00:32:56.163 --> 00:32:57.787
You want to go out with a bang?

308
00:33:11.247 --> 00:33:13.996
For the man who has everything.

309
00:33:13.996 --> 00:33:17.163
Ho... wow.

310
00:33:17.163 --> 00:33:20.413
Barrett 82,
.50 caliber.


311
00:33:20.413 --> 00:33:21.704
Just what I need.

312
00:33:21.704 --> 00:33:24.829
It's 35 pounds with the bipod.

313
00:33:24.829 --> 00:33:27.580
It's a lot of weight
if you have to run the hundred.


314
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.996
I suppose there's not much point in
you running, though, is there?


315
00:33:31.996 --> 00:33:35.163
Who's running?

316
00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:36.246
It's 10 Gs a day.

317
00:33:36.246 --> 00:33:37.829
And that's the pay up front

318
00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:43.246
because you're going to be dead buddy rate.

319
00:33:43.246 --> 00:33:46.746
Throw in the crotch gun.

320
00:33:46.746 --> 00:33:47.954
I like this one.

321
00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.455
Here.

322
00:33:53.455 --> 00:33:54.174
Sweet.

323
00:33:56.414 --> 00:33:59.121
Well, happiness is a warm gun.

324
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:01.704
Hey. One more thing. Right here.

325
00:34:01.704 --> 00:34:02.538
Ow.

326
00:34:04.372 --> 00:34:07.079
Ow, what the fuck are you doing?

327
00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:08.371
You said, "Hit me."

328
00:34:08.371 --> 00:34:12.037
I know. But I wasn't ready.

329
00:34:12.037 --> 00:34:14.204
I thought you were
going to ask me why.

330
00:34:14.204 --> 00:34:15.704
I know why.

331
00:34:15.704 --> 00:34:17.954
If you get caught,
you can tell them I robbed you.


332
00:34:19.414 --> 00:34:25.079
It's okay. I am okay.
It can't get much--


333
00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:26.204
Versace?

334
00:34:26.204 --> 00:34:29.996
No. It's Paul fucking Smith.

335
00:34:32.663 --> 00:34:33.662
I am back.

336
00:34:37.497 --> 00:34:40.871
Ahh... Jesus, Mae.

337
00:34:44.872 --> 00:34:46.079
I got to think.

338
00:35:12.705 --> 00:35:14.079
Mae, Mae.

339
00:35:15.788 --> 00:35:17.746
Your knots are getting sloppy.

340
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.996
What are you doing here?

341
00:35:20.996 --> 00:35:22.871
I was with the monks.

342
00:35:22.871 --> 00:35:24.204
I saw you leaving just now.

343
00:35:24.204 --> 00:35:25.746
Great.

344
00:35:25.746 --> 00:35:28.288
You think I had gone to
tell the gang about you?


345
00:35:28.288 --> 00:35:30.996
Just don't do that again.

346
00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:33.413
I am concerned about what we are doing.

347
00:35:33.413 --> 00:35:35.246
I went to talk
to the monks about it.

348
00:35:35.246 --> 00:35:37.288
Really?

349
00:35:37.288 --> 00:35:39.413
Why does everything
I say make you so angry?


350
00:35:39.413 --> 00:35:42.204
Because you actually seem to
believe what you're saying.


351
00:35:42.204 --> 00:35:43.996
No point in tying you up anymore.

352
00:35:43.996 --> 00:35:45.288
I told you that too.

353
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.288
She was something to you?

354
00:35:58.288 --> 00:36:01.329
Something to someone else.

355
00:36:01.329 --> 00:36:04.246
So you right wrongs?
Because it's the right thing?


356
00:36:04.246 --> 00:36:08.329
And because it pays.

357
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:10.329
You were discussing me with them?

358
00:36:10.329 --> 00:36:13.495
Not just you.

359
00:36:13.495 --> 00:36:15.996
Whether what I do is right or wrong?

360
00:36:15.996 --> 00:36:17.912
There is no right or wrong.

361
00:36:17.912 --> 00:36:19.662
Only what is and what comes.

362
00:36:19.662 --> 00:36:22.329
You kill those that do great harm.

363
00:36:22.329 --> 00:36:24.413
The world should punish them.

364
00:36:24.413 --> 00:36:26.871
They're not all bad.

365
00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:28.371
They're good for business.

366
00:36:33.122 --> 00:36:34.288
Take the long way back

367
00:36:34.288 --> 00:36:35.954
so their ghosts cannot follow.

368
00:36:39.621 --> 00:36:40.829
Wait here.

369
00:37:00.414 --> 00:37:02.163
Okay. Too crowded.

370
00:37:12.122 --> 00:37:15.246
Oh, I will definitely get back to you.

371
00:37:21.538 --> 00:37:24.163
Here, too.

372
00:38:55.663 --> 00:38:57.328
Ah, shit.

373
00:39:51.247 --> 00:39:52.662
Keys.

374
00:41:28.747 --> 00:41:31.287
Oh, my God. Mae?

375
00:41:31.287 --> 00:41:33.454
Come on out. Let's go.

376
00:41:33.454 --> 00:41:34.537
Come on.

377
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:40.454
You're bleeding.
You have been shot.


378
00:41:40.454 --> 00:41:41.829
Are you okay?

379
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:45.328
Not really.
I didn't know they were in there.


380
00:41:45.328 --> 00:41:46.829
Maybe you can help them.

381
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:48.746
Well, they can leave.

382
00:41:48.746 --> 00:41:50.662
Let's go. Before they come.

383
00:41:50.662 --> 00:41:52.037
Let's go.

384
00:42:00.371 --> 00:42:01.996
You can't let them do this to you.

385
00:42:01.996 --> 00:42:03.328
Come on, let's go.

386
00:42:03.328 --> 00:42:04.537
No, take us back.

387
00:42:04.537 --> 00:42:07.620
Yes, what are you doing?

388
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.829
Take us back.

389
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:11.162
What? Come on, you're free now.

390
00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:12.203
Come.

391
00:42:12.203 --> 00:42:13.120
It's okay.

392
00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.454
Come with me now.

393
00:42:14.454 --> 00:42:16.162
You're free to go now.

394
00:42:16.162 --> 00:42:17.495
No.

395
00:42:17.495 --> 00:42:21.037
They will find us.
They will kill us.


396
00:42:21.037 --> 00:42:24.579
It's because of the drugs.
They need to go back.


397
00:42:39.288 --> 00:42:41.579
What were you doing in there?

398
00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:43.912
They put us in
the truck when you attacked.

399
00:42:43.912 --> 00:42:47.245
Not the truck.
What were you doing in the house?


400
00:42:47.245 --> 00:42:48.494
Fuck.

401
00:42:51.496 --> 00:42:54.829
I went to tell them if they would
stop what they are doing


402
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:56.996
you would stop killing them.

403
00:42:56.996 --> 00:43:00.829
We shouldn't have left the girls.

404
00:43:03.163 --> 00:43:05.370
That's not what I do.

405
00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.287
Even if they get out

406
00:43:07.287 --> 00:43:13.203
what's been done to them is
who they are now.


407
00:43:13.203 --> 00:43:17.203
What do you keep staring at?

408
00:43:17.203 --> 00:43:19.454
You crazy.

409
00:43:33.705 --> 00:43:35.370
Don't touch it.

410
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:42.704
Well,
I hope you got the prick who stole this.


411
00:44:42.704 --> 00:44:44.370
You were robbed?

412
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.328
Yes. Surprised him at my warehouse
yesterday on his way out.


413
00:44:48.328 --> 00:44:50.662
So, did you get a good look?

414
00:44:50.662 --> 00:44:54.287
For as long as it took for him
to break my nose.


415
00:44:54.287 --> 00:44:55.787
White boy, you know

416
00:44:55.787 --> 00:44:57.829
about my height but, uh, packing pounds.

417
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:59.203
Blond hair. Goatee.

418
00:44:59.203 --> 00:45:01.620
Face like a smacked ass.

419
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.912
Hey, I thought I was protected.

420
00:45:04.912 --> 00:45:06.704
They hit me, they hit you. Right?

421
00:45:07.913 --> 00:45:09.162
Ah.

422
00:45:09.162 --> 00:45:12.078
You recall any details,
you will let us know.


423
00:45:12.078 --> 00:45:14.245
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

424
00:45:35.455 --> 00:45:38.120
I will take care of you.

425
00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.412
Mae?

426
00:45:39.412 --> 00:45:42.953
I will love you in so many ways.

427
00:45:44.954 --> 00:45:48.454
Touch you in so many places.

428
00:45:52.538 --> 00:45:57.412
Make you feel so good.

429
00:46:02.204 --> 00:46:03.579
You are so cold.

430
00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:11.787
Who took the bullet out?

431
00:46:11.787 --> 00:46:13.662
It went right through.

432
00:46:13.662 --> 00:46:16.162
Looks like you have attracted
a few bad spirits.


433
00:46:16.162 --> 00:46:19.454
Ah,
here you go talking that nonsense again.


434
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:25.203
Khamin chan and other herbs

435
00:46:25.203 --> 00:46:27.537
and holy ash from a sacrificial fire.

436
00:46:27.537 --> 00:46:28.746
It will protect you.

437
00:46:28.746 --> 00:46:30.662
Oh, no.

438
00:46:30.662 --> 00:46:33.620
The monks do not know what you do,
so they help.


439
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.328
I feel like I am losing my mind.

440
00:46:40.328 --> 00:46:42.328
Maybe that's a good thing.

441
00:46:45.079 --> 00:46:47.829
Maybe better to let you bleed to death.

442
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:50.953
It would be easier
for you to die and start over.


443
00:46:56.371 --> 00:46:59.662
Why are you looking at me that way?

444
00:46:59.662 --> 00:47:02.995
Oh, I am just wondering if
I am still dreaming.


445
00:47:02.995 --> 00:47:05.412
Or maybe you were awake.

446
00:47:05.412 --> 00:47:07.995
And are now dreaming.

447
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.120
I have no idea what you're talking about.

448
00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:26.162
You look like you're being followed,
English.


449
00:47:33.288 --> 00:47:34.328
Got you.

450
00:47:57.455 --> 00:47:59.287
Oh, no.

451
00:47:59.287 --> 00:48:02.579
Not you again. Upstairs.

452
00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:05.120
Come on.

453
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.911
I got your gun.

454
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:08.454
Yeah. One of them.

455
00:48:08.454 --> 00:48:10.245
They found my Barrett so
they're all over out there.


456
00:48:10.245 --> 00:48:11.786
Not anymore.

457
00:48:11.786 --> 00:48:13.454
Oh, great.

458
00:48:13.454 --> 00:48:15.870
So with that,
you just confirmed my involvement.


459
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:18.203
Don't answer it.

460
00:48:18.203 --> 00:48:20.495
Bastards can track that
as good as the government.


461
00:48:20.495 --> 00:48:24.454
It's not mine. I took it off one of
the guys outside your place.


462
00:48:24.454 --> 00:48:26.412
Then they're checking in. Come on.

463
00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:30.579
We're taking the high ground.

464
00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:32.662
I need something for up close.

465
00:48:32.662 --> 00:48:35.120
Another gun?

466
00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.162
And you lied about bringing
back the last one.


467
00:48:37.162 --> 00:48:39.495
Right. And?

468
00:48:39.495 --> 00:48:42.786
No. No. No way. No. 
Not happening.

469
00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.245
No, no, no.

470
00:48:51.246 --> 00:48:53.953
Because I am dead.
Put your boss on.


471
00:48:53.953 --> 00:48:55.620
You want to say hello?

472
00:49:01.496 --> 00:49:04.036
Now am I getting what I want?

473
00:49:04.036 --> 00:49:05.287
What is it you want?

474
00:49:05.287 --> 00:49:06.953
Not you. Hold on.

475
00:49:06.953 --> 00:49:08.202
Well?

476
00:49:10.288 --> 00:49:12.162
I will give you
some time to think about it.


477
00:49:12.162 --> 00:49:13.786
I am back.

478
00:49:13.786 --> 00:49:17.662
We should meet.
Come to some understanding.


479
00:49:17.662 --> 00:49:20.537
I will never have
any understanding of what you do.


480
00:49:20.537 --> 00:49:21.286
Hm.

481
00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:25.245
You understand that most of these girls

482
00:49:25.245 --> 00:49:28.120
are sold by their own parents?

483
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.786
To pay off debt, or just abandoned?

484
00:49:31.786 --> 00:49:34.328
That we find a place for them

485
00:49:34.328 --> 00:49:38.995
and for doing so take some small profit

486
00:49:38.995 --> 00:49:45.162
from something they will give away
or trade for less on their own.


487
00:49:45.162 --> 00:49:47.245
You understand we give

488
00:49:47.245 --> 00:49:50.661
what little they have to offer value?

489
00:49:50.661 --> 00:49:52.495
You give bullets value.

490
00:49:52.495 --> 00:49:53.703
Now you want to
give me what I want

491
00:49:53.703 --> 00:49:57.828
or you want to talk to the boss?

492
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:15.661
I am glad you find this so amusing.

493
00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:16.828
Get out.

494
00:50:16.828 --> 00:50:18.328
Just get out.

495
00:50:21.413 --> 00:50:23.162
I have to keep going.

496
00:50:23.162 --> 00:50:25.078
You're not going to shoot me.

497
00:50:25.078 --> 00:50:26.579
I might as well.

498
00:50:26.579 --> 00:50:29.162
You're as good as dead
unless I get another gun.


499
00:50:29.162 --> 00:50:30.786
Now give me another guns

500
00:50:30.786 --> 00:50:33.870
so there won't be anybody
left to come after you.


501
00:50:38.746 --> 00:50:40.454
Cobray Street Sweeper.

502
00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:43.619
I will take this.

503
00:50:43.619 --> 00:50:46.828
It's a thousand a day.

504
00:50:46.828 --> 00:50:49.828
You know, you're always out there.

505
00:50:49.828 --> 00:50:53.036
When did you start believing
that you can't be killed?


506
00:50:59.163 --> 00:51:00.245
I haven't.

507
00:51:08.912 --> 00:51:10.578
Do you like what you do?

508
00:51:15.996 --> 00:51:18.287
I do it without remorse.

509
00:51:18.287 --> 00:51:21.911
I cast no shadow about it.

510
00:51:21.911 --> 00:51:25.745
Intent is most important for
future well-being.


511
00:51:25.745 --> 00:51:27.454
Intent makes karma.

512
00:51:27.454 --> 00:51:29.495
What will you do with the money
you are paid?


513
00:51:29.495 --> 00:51:31.870
You know, all this is just
what you have come up with....


514
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:34.828
...to fool yourself
into some kind of happiness.


515
00:51:34.828 --> 00:51:36.661
And what do you use to fool yourself?

516
00:51:36.661 --> 00:51:41.036
It doesn't get any more real
than what I do.


517
00:51:41.036 --> 00:51:43.953
You do not know
as much as you think you do.


518
00:51:43.953 --> 00:51:45.661
Starting from who you are....

519
00:51:45.661 --> 00:51:47.870
...all the way to the man
in that hotel room.


520
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:49.995
What do you know about him?

521
00:51:49.995 --> 00:51:51.703
You have seen him before?

522
00:51:51.703 --> 00:51:52.703
Hm.

523
00:52:29.912 --> 00:52:32.245
You are crazy, man.

524
00:52:32.245 --> 00:52:33.995
I told you to stop killing them.

525
00:52:33.995 --> 00:52:36.745
You owe me. Ten o'clock.
Same hotel room.


526
00:52:39.246 --> 00:52:43.078
Hey, mister.
How much longer you waiting?


527
00:52:54.246 --> 00:52:55.245
Follow him.

528
00:53:37.037 --> 00:53:38.745
Hey, can I help you?

529
00:53:38.745 --> 00:53:40.661
Uh, yes.

530
00:53:40.661 --> 00:53:43.245
Twelve and, uh, fifteen are available.

531
00:53:47.704 --> 00:53:49.078
Twelve.

532
00:53:49.078 --> 00:53:50.953
She'd be my choice. Youngest.

533
00:53:50.953 --> 00:53:52.536
But don't let her age fool you.

534
00:53:52.536 --> 00:53:54.411
Down the hall. Take a left.

535
00:53:54.411 --> 00:53:55.953
Up the stairs. Green door.

536
00:54:28.912 --> 00:54:31.453
What can I do for you?

537
00:54:31.453 --> 00:54:33.661
Whatever you want, big man.

538
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:37.661
Okay. Sit. Sit... sit down.

539
00:54:37.661 --> 00:54:41.162
You know the man
with the big ruby ring?

540
00:54:41.162 --> 00:54:43.661
Where is he?

541
00:54:43.661 --> 00:54:45.578
I will do whatever you want.

542
00:54:45.578 --> 00:54:50.745
Is he the boss or a customer?

543
00:54:50.745 --> 00:54:53.162
There are many men who come.

544
00:54:53.162 --> 00:54:55.953
Where is his office?

545
00:54:55.953 --> 00:54:58.245
Where is his office?

546
00:54:58.245 --> 00:55:00.494
He is upstairs. Top floor.

547
00:57:06.287 --> 00:57:07.536
I want him alive.

548
00:57:07.536 --> 00:57:08.911
Alive.

549
00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.578
Wait. Coming out.

550
00:57:51.578 --> 00:57:53.327
Coming out.

551
00:57:54.954 --> 00:57:56.036
I can explain.

552
00:58:01.912 --> 00:58:03.244
Empty it.

553
00:58:03.244 --> 00:58:04.369
The safe.

554
00:58:04.369 --> 00:58:05.494
Okay.

555
00:58:05.494 --> 00:58:06.494
I wasn't told you were a crook.

556
00:58:06.494 --> 00:58:07.411
I am not.

557
00:58:09.287 --> 00:58:11.995
You're now paying for the numbers
I just racked up here.


558
00:58:11.995 --> 00:58:13.536
What's this really about?

559
00:58:13.536 --> 00:58:15.870
Would you have gone at the whole
gang if I'd told you?


560
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:17.286
So what gang are you?

561
00:58:17.286 --> 00:58:19.286
Am I a way of making war with
the Chang Kao....


562
00:58:19.286 --> 00:58:21.494
...without you losing men?

563
00:58:21.494 --> 00:58:22.369
Hmm?

564
00:58:22.369 --> 00:58:25.745
Do you really care?

565
00:58:26.704 --> 00:58:27.995
Huh?

566
00:58:27.995 --> 00:58:29.911
I wanted you alive

567
00:58:29.911 --> 00:58:31.870
so I could double everything.

568
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:32.953
For one more man.

569
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.244
Advisor Bhun.

570
00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:41.786
Why him and not the boss?

571
00:58:41.786 --> 00:58:45.661
The old man is sick.
He will be dead soon.


572
00:58:45.661 --> 00:58:47.286
You're thinking about it.

573
00:58:47.286 --> 00:58:50.369
because if you weren't,
I'd already be dead.


574
00:58:50.369 --> 00:58:52.119
Why are you looking at me like that?

575
00:58:52.119 --> 00:58:54.786
Does any of it really matter
why you're doing it?


576
00:58:54.786 --> 00:58:58.619
Does it have anything to do with
my story of, of the daughter?


577
00:58:58.619 --> 00:59:00.953
Another million for one man.

578
00:59:42.871 --> 00:59:46.995
Try and focus on my neck and shoulders.

579
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:49.995
Too much stress.

580
00:59:49.995 --> 00:59:51.494
Oh, you have no idea.

581
00:59:51.494 --> 00:59:53.161
But why do you say that
like it's a good thing?


582
00:59:53.288 --> 00:59:55.411
I want his name.

583
00:59:55.411 --> 00:59:56.745
And I want to know

584
00:59:56.745 --> 00:59:59.619
who needed me in my underwear for this?

585
01:00:02.412 --> 01:00:04.161
What's his name?

586
01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:05.327
Pudding Thame.

587
01:00:05.327 --> 01:00:06.494
Ask me again

588
01:00:06.494 --> 01:00:10.161
I will tell you the same.

589
01:00:14.495 --> 01:00:16.161
Oh, fuck.

590
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:17.327
His name?

591
01:00:17.327 --> 01:00:19.077
You're pissing in the wind.

592
01:00:22.746 --> 01:00:24.661
Why do you work against us?

593
01:00:24.661 --> 01:00:26.327
You are in the same business.

594
01:00:26.327 --> 01:00:29.411
No, the girls that work for me--

595
01:00:29.411 --> 01:00:32.619
have filled out an application.

596
01:00:32.619 --> 01:00:35.244
They enjoy their work.
They're artists.


597
01:00:42.746 --> 01:00:45.119
All right. All right.
I will tell you.


598
01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:46.453
I will tell you.

599
01:00:50.662 --> 01:00:52.619
Not because it hurts.

600
01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:54.619
But because

601
01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:57.411
he... wouldn't care.

602
01:00:57.411 --> 01:00:59.244
It's Church.

603
01:00:59.244 --> 01:01:01.369
Curtie Church.

604
01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:05.161
And who would want someone with
the skills of Curtie Church here?


605
01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.994
I don't know.

606
01:01:11.078 --> 01:01:12.327
Where is he?

607
01:01:12.327 --> 01:01:14.327
I don't know that.

608
01:01:15.995 --> 01:01:17.619
Who is he working for?

609
01:01:17.619 --> 01:01:20.077
I don't know that either.

610
01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:23.202
Do you think he'd be stupid
enough to tell me?


611
01:01:38.036 --> 01:01:39.952
Why do you help him against us?

612
01:01:39.952 --> 01:01:42.619
Because I am more afraid of him--

613
01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:45.952
than I am of you. 
You understand?

614
01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:48.994
And you haven't even pissed him off yet.

615
01:01:53.287 --> 01:01:58.244
What he's doing to you
is death taking a holiday.


616
01:02:03.746 --> 01:02:05.119
You're already dead.

617
01:06:49.745 --> 01:06:51.244
You don't sleep so well, do you?

618
01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:01.327
I didn't do anything
bad enough to deserve this.


619
01:07:06.412 --> 01:07:09.161
Will you go out again tonight?

620
01:07:09.161 --> 01:07:09.910
No.

621
01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:15.244
No, I am done here.

622
01:09:26.911 --> 01:09:28.327
Going to the toilet.

623
01:09:28.327 --> 01:09:32.369
You want to watch,
you handle the paperwork.


624
01:09:44.536 --> 01:09:46.327
I told them who you are.

625
01:09:46.327 --> 01:09:48.286
For real this time.

626
01:09:48.286 --> 01:09:49.702
And not because they broke me.

627
01:09:49.702 --> 01:09:52.827
But because now you have no
choice but to run.


628
01:09:52.827 --> 01:09:55.744
Already decided I am out.
What about you?


629
01:09:55.744 --> 01:09:58.161
I will figure something out.

630
01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:00.327
But you're willing to do that?

631
01:10:00.327 --> 01:10:03.577
Listen, I need one last thing.
I need to set a girl up.


632
01:10:03.577 --> 01:10:08.660
Maybe 14. Adoption and private
school. How much for that?


633
01:10:11.745 --> 01:10:15.618
Don't know.
Ten Gs will buy a family and a history.


634
01:10:15.618 --> 01:10:18.327
Another 20 will pay her way
till she graduates.


635
01:10:18.327 --> 01:10:19.702
Cool. Done.

636
01:10:19.702 --> 01:10:21.244
I told her to
wait at the Lotus Temple.

637
01:10:21.244 --> 01:10:23.202
Your half of the money's there,
and your guns.


638
01:10:23.202 --> 01:10:24.785
Hey. Hey. What are you doing in there?

639
01:10:24.785 --> 01:10:28.119
I can't concentrate in here
if you're listening.


640
01:10:30.745 --> 01:10:34.077
I guess I will, uh, you know,
see you down the road.


641
01:10:34.077 --> 01:10:37.785
Thanks, English.

642
01:10:37.785 --> 01:10:39.452
Hey. Hey. Let's go.

643
01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:49.202
Crap, oh, that feels good.

644
01:10:49.202 --> 01:10:50.827
Oh, here's an idea.

645
01:10:50.827 --> 01:10:51.869
Why don't you guys

646
01:10:51.869 --> 01:10:53.869
just go out of the room,

647
01:10:53.869 --> 01:10:55.161
one at a time come back in,

648
01:10:55.161 --> 01:10:56.660
and we will see
who's made of what, huh?

649
01:10:58.245 --> 01:11:00.161
I will take you up on that.

650
01:11:11.453 --> 01:11:13.702
Just spoke to him.

651
01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:14.910
Where is he?

652
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.827
Good news. He's going to disappear.

653
01:11:17.827 --> 01:11:20.493
And you will be your father's son
again in no time.


654
01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:21.869
We're good.

655
01:11:21.869 --> 01:11:24.161
You gave his name,
and we're going to find him.


656
01:11:24.161 --> 01:11:26.994
What do you mean? No. No, no,
you don't have to do that.


657
01:11:26.994 --> 01:11:28.994
You know he went too far.

658
01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:32.327
I need his head now to
assure the position.


659
01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:58.577
This is for you.

660
01:12:04.078 --> 01:12:07.161
No one ever gave me--

661
01:12:22.578 --> 01:12:23.577
Thank you.

662
01:12:23.577 --> 01:12:24.910
You're welcome.

663
01:12:27.453 --> 01:12:31.161
My name is Curtie.

664
01:12:31.161 --> 01:12:34.161
Curtie Church.

665
01:12:37.162 --> 01:12:39.869
Like hurt? Only friendlier?

666
01:12:39.869 --> 01:12:42.035
No, like Curtis.

667
01:12:42.035 --> 01:12:44.744
Only misspelled on my birth certificate.

668
01:12:44.744 --> 01:12:46.326
It was meant to be.

669
01:12:46.326 --> 01:12:47.577
And April second...

670
01:12:47.577 --> 01:12:50.326
month and date of my birth.

671
01:12:54.786 --> 01:13:00.035
Today's Friday,
so wear blue for luck today.


672
01:13:00.035 --> 01:13:02.994
Tomorrow wear pink.

673
01:13:02.994 --> 01:13:06.077
Ooh.
Tomorrow may be a bad day for me then.


674
01:13:06.077 --> 01:13:08.702
You can wear it underneath.

675
01:13:08.702 --> 01:13:10.285
That could make it even worse.

676
01:13:20.828 --> 01:13:27.493
Listen, I want to thank you for
taking an interest in me.


677
01:13:27.493 --> 01:13:32.243
You're wrong.
I am just doing it for me.


678
01:13:40.162 --> 01:13:41.618
You're leaving me, aren't you?

679
01:13:51.536 --> 01:13:53.910
I have someone coming for you

680
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:56.410
who will help you.

681
01:13:56.410 --> 01:14:00.201
You have to promise me
you will wait here. Hmm?


682
01:14:02.661 --> 01:14:04.161
Promise?

683
01:14:07.327 --> 01:14:08.660
Okay.

684
01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.659
Hmm.

685
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:52.243
Yeah, Jimmy?

686
01:14:52.243 --> 01:14:54.160
I was hoping I'd catch you.

687
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.243
Yeah,
the flight's just about to leave.


688
01:14:56.243 --> 01:14:58.660
At the airport already, huh?

689
01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.410
I don't blame you.
Too many ghosts.


690
01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:04.035
Did you get your money?

691
01:15:04.035 --> 01:15:07.243
Yeah. It's too much.
But, uh, thanks for that.


692
01:15:07.243 --> 01:15:09.285
The reason I am calling is, um

693
01:15:09.285 --> 01:15:12.201
your girl, she wasn't there.

694
01:15:12.201 --> 01:15:15.869
Impossible. She wouldn't leave.
Did you wait?


695
01:15:15.869 --> 01:15:16.994
I waited.

696
01:15:16.994 --> 01:15:18.785
Sorry, Church.

697
01:15:18.785 --> 01:15:19.952
Thanks.

698
01:15:23.036 --> 01:15:28.577
Well, I hope this confirms my loyalty.

699
01:15:53.494 --> 01:15:54.952
Fucking Jimmy.

700
01:15:56.745 --> 01:15:57.994
Come on. Let's go.

701
01:19:00.161 --> 01:19:01.869
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

702
01:19:04.327 --> 01:19:06.118
Wait.

703
01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:10.827
Oh, English.

704
01:19:10.827 --> 01:19:13.452
How many times did
I tell you to leave?

705
01:19:13.452 --> 01:19:14.326
Shoot the son of a bitch.

706
01:19:14.326 --> 01:19:16.493
Are you insane? No.

707
01:19:16.493 --> 01:19:21.618
Okay. Couple million dollars
and your life for the girls.


708
01:19:21.618 --> 01:19:23.368
Who paid you the money to do this?

709
01:19:23.368 --> 01:19:25.368
Ask him.

710
01:19:25.368 --> 01:19:27.034
We're going to talk to this devil

711
01:19:27.034 --> 01:19:28.785
while he holds a
gun to my father's head?

712
01:19:28.785 --> 01:19:32.160
Hey, hey.
Let this son of the bitch speak.


713
01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.744
No, it's too late for that.

714
01:19:37.244 --> 01:19:38.326
Don't move.

715
01:19:38.326 --> 01:19:40.326
Hold your fire.

716
01:19:45.286 --> 01:19:47.493
Changed my mind.

717
01:19:49.536 --> 01:19:52.368
Was it my son who arranged this?

718
01:19:52.368 --> 01:19:54.951
Was he trying to
kill the secret with you?

719
01:19:59.869 --> 01:20:02.285
Bring the girls in.

720
01:20:20.994 --> 01:20:22.785
There's one missing.

721
01:20:22.785 --> 01:20:26.118
Where's the one you took from the temple?
Mae.


722
01:20:26.118 --> 01:20:30.993
There was no one there except the monks.

723
01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:33.909
I don't remember any Mae.

724
01:20:33.909 --> 01:20:35.909
I will find you, Mae.

725
01:20:43.411 --> 01:20:49.493
Mae. Here. That's Mae for you.

726
01:20:49.493 --> 01:20:52.368
Oh, that Mae.

727
01:20:52.368 --> 01:20:54.160
Oh, yes. That Mae.

728
01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.744
You're insane.

729
01:20:55.744 --> 01:20:57.118
What are you talking about?

730
01:20:57.118 --> 01:20:58.993
I remember her.

731
01:20:58.993 --> 01:21:00.826
She was special.

732
01:21:00.826 --> 01:21:02.826
First girl that I brought in.

733
01:21:02.826 --> 01:21:05.034
And that's me beside her.

734
01:21:08.244 --> 01:21:10.744
Some 30 years ago.

735
01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:15.076
It's not a coincidence.

736
01:21:15.076 --> 01:21:17.243
It was meant to
be that I find you.

737
01:21:19.411 --> 01:21:23.909
Church. What's going on?

738
01:21:23.909 --> 01:21:28.326
Do we have a deal on the others?

739
01:21:28.326 --> 01:21:29.493
I want to thank you for

740
01:21:29.493 --> 01:21:31.160
taking an interest in me.

741
01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.368
I am just doing it for me.

742
01:21:33.368 --> 01:21:35.285
Do we have a deal?

743
01:21:35.285 --> 01:21:36.868
It's in the car.

744
01:21:49.077 --> 01:21:52.993
I will take care of you.

745
01:21:52.993 --> 01:21:53.992
Mae?

746
01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:56.743
Mae?

747
01:21:56.743 --> 01:21:58.076
Drive.

748
01:21:58.076 --> 01:21:59.702
You crazy.

749
01:21:59.702 --> 01:22:01.140
You crazy...

750
01:22:05.244 --> 01:22:08.076
Put the guns down.

751
01:22:08.076 --> 01:22:08.875
And let them go.

752
01:22:12.536 --> 01:22:13.951
So you right wrongs

753
01:22:13.951 --> 01:22:16.160
because it's the right thing?

754
01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.993
I am happy that you have decided
to stay here and continue.


755
01:22:19.993 --> 01:22:21.826
We shouldn't have left the girls.

756
01:22:21.826 --> 01:22:24.909
Maybe you can help them.

757
01:22:28.702 --> 01:22:31.076
Get your bag.

758
01:22:40.202 --> 01:22:42.243
It was all about bringing you

759
01:22:42.243 --> 01:22:45.368
to a place of understanding.

760
01:22:45.368 --> 01:22:50.160
My voice was there
to help you all along.

761
01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.118
It was about bringing you to the decision

762
01:22:52.118 --> 01:22:55.452
to stay here and right these wrongs.

763
01:23:50.952 --> 01:23:55.368
So I guess, uh,
one of those spirits really found you.


764
01:23:57.869 --> 01:23:58.951
Guess that's a good thing.

765
01:23:58.951 --> 01:24:01.326
Before you were losing your mind.

766
01:24:01.326 --> 01:24:04.410
English. Stop the truck.

767
01:24:04.410 --> 01:24:06.493
English...

768
01:24:06.493 --> 01:24:08.617
Please, stop the truck.

769
01:24:35.244 --> 01:24:37.576
I have to go back.

770
01:24:37.576 --> 01:24:40.076
I will see to
it that they get help.

771
01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:43.576
Thanks, buddy.

772
01:24:54.618 --> 01:24:57.993
I can now be with you, 
Curtie Church.

773
01:24:57.993 --> 01:25:00.243
And you can be with me.

774
01:25:00.243 --> 01:25:02.701
With the darkness which you offer.

775
01:25:02.701 --> 01:25:05.118
And which my light needs to shine.

776
01:25:05.118 --> 01:25:08.909
It was the initiation of a monk.

777
01:25:08.909 --> 01:25:09.988
A monk...
