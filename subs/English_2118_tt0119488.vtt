1
00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:28.872
Come to Los Angeles.

2
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.377
The sun shines bright, the
beaches are wide and inviting ...


3
00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:37.130
and the orange groves stretch
as far as the eye can see.


4
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.260
There are jobs aplenty
and land is cheap.


5
00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.804
Every workingman can
have his own house ...


6
00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:48.725
and inside every house,
a happy, all-American family.


7
00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.937
You can have all this.
And who knows?


8
00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:54.189
You could even be discovered ...

9
00:00:54.357 --> 00:00:57.651
become a movie star,
or at least see one.


10
00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.112
Life is good in Los Angeles.

11
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.948
It's paradise on Earth.

12
00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:09.121
That's what they tell you, anyway,
because they're selling an image.


13
00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.000
They're selling it through movies,
radio and television.


14
00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:17.045
In the hit show "Badge of Honor",
the L.A. cops walk on water ...


15
00:01:17.213 --> 00:01:19.673
as they keep the city
clean of crooks.


16
00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:23.218
Yep, you'd think this place
was the Garden of Eden.


17
00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:25.637
But there's trouble in paradise ...

18
00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:30.183
and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C to his fans.


19
00:01:30.518 --> 00:01:35.063
Local L.A. color to the nth degree.
And his number-one bodyguard ...


20
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:37.691
Johnny Stompanato.

21
00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.777
Mickey C's the head
of organized crime in these parts.


22
00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:45.991
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.
He kills a dozen people a year ...


23
00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:49.703
and the dapper little gent
does it in style.


24
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:52.831
And every time his picture's
on the front page ...


25
00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.043
it's a black eye
for the image of Los Angeles.


26
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.670
Because how can organized crime exist ...

27
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.382
in the city with the best
police force in the world?


28
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.842
Something has to be done.

29
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.095
But nothing too original,
because, hey, this is Hollywood.


30
00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:10.432
What worked for Al Capone
would work for the Mickster.


31
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.895
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.
Non-payment of federal income tax.


32
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:16.813
But all is not well.

33
00:02:17.023 --> 00:02:21.109
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum,
and it's only a matter of time ...


34
00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:25.280
before someone
with balls of brass tries to fill it.


35
00:02:25.448 --> 00:02:31.161
"Remember, dear readers,
you heard it here first.


36
00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.916
Off the record, on the q.t. ...

37
00:02:36.084 --> 00:02:39.586
and very hush-hush."

38
00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:03.235
You're like Santa Claus with that list, Bud,
except everyone on it's been naughty.


39
00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.155
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.

40
00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:08.865
Leave it for later.

41
00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.952
We gotta pick up the booze
and get it to the station.


42
00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.415
Hollywood, this is 6
-Adam-7.

43
00:03:16.582 --> 00:03:20.544
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.


44
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.422
Parole violation.
Assault arising from a family dispute.


45
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.340
We won't be here,
but they'll see him.


46
00:03:35.017 --> 00:03:36.184
Quit your whining.

47
00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:38.603
Quit whining all the time.
It makes me sick.


48
00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:40.814
Shut up.

49
00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.874
- Who in the hell are you?
- The ghost of Christmas past.


50
00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:03.211
- Dance with a man for a change.
- What are you, some kind of smart-ass?


51
00:04:16.726 --> 00:04:21.062
You'll be out in a year and a half.
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.


52
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.859
You touch her again, I'll have you
violated on a kiddie-raper beef.


53
00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:30.071
You know what they do
to kiddie rapers in Quentin.


54
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.166
You got someplace you can go?

55
00:04:42.043 --> 00:04:44.252
Go get yourself fixed up.

56
00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:49.925
Merry Christmas, huh?

57
00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:53.261
- Merry Christmas, ma'am.
- Let's go, Bud.


58
00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:55.222
The guys will be waiting.

59
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:01.228
What do you do on "Badge of Honor",
Jack?


60
00:05:01.437 --> 00:05:04.231
I'm the, um, technical adviser.

61
00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:08.109
I teach Brett Chase
how to walk and talk like a cop.


62
00:05:08.277 --> 00:05:10.445
Brett Chase doesn't
walk and talk like you.


63
00:05:10.613 --> 00:05:13.281
Well, that's because
he's the television version.


64
00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.617
America isn't ready for the real me.

65
00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:17.786
Is it true you're the one
who arrested Bob Mitchum?


66
00:05:17.954 --> 00:05:18.995
Mm-hm.

67
00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:20.789
These "Badge of Honor" guys
like to pretend ...


68
00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:23.875
but being the real thing
must be a thrill.


69
00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:25.877
Why don't you and I
go someplace quiet?


70
00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:28.296
I'd love to give you the lowdown
on Mitchum.


71
00:05:28.464 --> 00:05:31.424
- Big V. Jack Vincennes.
- Hey.


72
00:05:31.592 --> 00:05:33.176
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.


73
00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:35.679
Karen, this is Sid Hudgens
from Hush-Hush magazine.


74
00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:38.181
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello, yourself.


75
00:05:38.474 --> 00:05:39.641
Mm-hm.

76
00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:40.934
What's that about?

77
00:05:41.102 --> 00:05:44.646
We did a piece, "ingÃ©nue Dykes in
Hollywood." Her name got mentioned.


78
00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:47.023
Hey, Jackie boy ...

79
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:49.776
a friend just sold some reefer
to Matt Reynolds.


80
00:05:49.944 --> 00:05:52.904
He's tripping the "Light Fantastic"
with Tammy Jordan.


81
00:05:54.532 --> 00:05:56.533
Sorry, I lost you for a second, Sid.

82
00:05:56.701 --> 00:06:00.996
Contract players, Metro. You pinch
them, I do a nice feature next issue.


83
00:06:01.163 --> 00:06:03.623
- Plus the usual 50 cash.
- No, I need another 50.


84
00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:07.294
Two 20s for two patrolmen,
and a dime for the watch commander.


85
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:09.963
Jackie, it's Christmas.

86
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.464
No, it's not.

87
00:06:11.632 --> 00:06:13.675
It's felony possession of marijuana.

88
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.805
Actually, it's circulation 36,000
and climbing.


89
00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:21.766
There's no telling where this is gonna go.
Radio, television.


90
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.937
Once you whet the public's appetite
for the truth, the sky's the limit.


91
00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:34.029
Sergeant Ed Exley,
son of the legendary Preston Exley.


92
00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:35.864
Must be a hard act to follow.

93
00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:40.702
Why not make a mark somewhere else?
Why become a cop, Ed?


94
00:06:41.162 --> 00:06:42.954
I like to help people.

95
00:06:43.164 --> 00:06:45.790
We heard two officers
were assaulted this evening.


96
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.752
- What do you think about that?
- Goes with the job.


97
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:50.879
I took the report.
Luckily, they're okay.


98
00:06:51.088 --> 00:06:53.006
Aren't you young
to be watch commander?


99
00:06:53.174 --> 00:06:54.215
It's only tonight.

100
00:06:54.675 --> 00:06:57.218
The married men have Christmas Eve off.

101
00:06:57.386 --> 00:06:59.304
- That's a good lead for the story.
- Sure.


102
00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:01.473
Merry Christmas, captain.

103
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:04.184
- Captain Smith.
- Drop the formalities, Bobby.


104
00:07:04.352 --> 00:07:08.063
- It's Christmas Eve. Call me Dudley.
- I came up with a title for the story.


105
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.066
I'm calling it
"Silent Night With the L.A.P.D."


106
00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:12.817
That's grand.

107
00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:16.738
Now, remember, Bobby, that's "Smith."
With an S.


108
00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:21.910
- Thank you, gentlemen. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.


109
00:07:22.078 --> 00:07:23.078
Hold on there, lads.

110
00:07:26.374 --> 00:07:29.125
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.


111
00:07:30.503 --> 00:07:33.380
I saw the test results
on the lieutenant's exam.


112
00:07:33.547 --> 00:07:36.800
First out of 23.
What'll it be, then?


113
00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:39.427
Patrol Division?
Internal Affairs? What?


114
00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:41.096
I was thinking
Detective Bureau.


115
00:07:45.726 --> 00:07:48.728
Edmund, you're a political animal.

116
00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:51.981
You have the eye for human weakness,
but not the stomach.


117
00:07:53.693 --> 00:07:55.443
You're wrong, sir.

118
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:59.364
Would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty ...


119
00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:01.366
in order to ensure an indictment?

120
00:08:01.617 --> 00:08:03.702
- We've been over this.
- Yes or no?


121
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:05.036
No.

122
00:08:05.204 --> 00:08:08.289
Would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?


123
00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:09.457
No.

124
00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:12.293
Would you shoot
a hardened criminal in the back ...


125
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:14.838
in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer --?


126
00:08:15.005 --> 00:08:16.339
No.

127
00:08:16.507 --> 00:08:19.676
Then for the love of God,
don't be a detective.


128
00:08:19.844 --> 00:08:22.804
Stick to assignments where you don't
have to make those choices.


129
00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:25.306
Dudley, I know you mean well ...

130
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:29.477
but I don't need to do it
the way you did, or my father.


131
00:08:30.646 --> 00:08:32.772
At least get rid of the glasses.

132
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.608
I can't think of a man
in the bureau who wears them.


133
00:08:44.785 --> 00:08:46.911
If I get held up,
you guys better be here.


134
00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:55.587
Hi, Nick. I need a delivery.

135
00:08:55.755 --> 00:08:58.506
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.

136
00:08:58.674 --> 00:09:01.301
That sounds like a hell of a party.
Be right with you.


137
00:09:20.196 --> 00:09:21.321
Merry Christmas.

138
00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:25.116
Merry Christmas to you, officer.

139
00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:29.120
That obvious, huh?

140
00:09:29.705 --> 00:09:32.040
It's practically
stamped on your forehead.


141
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.125
There you go, White.

142
00:10:07.243 --> 00:10:09.077
See what he wants, Buzz.

143
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.915
Hey.

144
00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:16.084
Get lost, why don't you?

145
00:10:23.384 --> 00:10:25.593
Down.
Get your fucking head down.


146
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:28.763
I got a license for that.

147
00:10:31.934 --> 00:10:34.644
Cut me some slack.
I used to be a cop.


148
00:10:34.854 --> 00:10:36.938
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.


149
00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:39.440
They call me Buzz.

150
00:10:39.608 --> 00:10:43.111
I don't give a rat's ass what
they call you. Keep your head down.


151
00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:46.239
And stay there, Buzz.

152
00:10:48.117 --> 00:10:50.910
- You okay?
- She's fine.


153
00:10:51.287 --> 00:10:52.704
I'm not asking you, sir.

154
00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:58.126
- Somebody hit you?
- It's not what you think.


155
00:11:01.422 --> 00:11:02.463
What is it, then?

156
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:06.050
You got the wrong idea, mister.
I'm fine.


157
00:11:06.635 --> 00:11:09.429
But it's nice to know you care.

158
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.814
Drive safely.

159
00:11:20.774 --> 00:11:22.525
What's going on?

160
00:11:25.946 --> 00:11:29.741
- You know him?
- Yeah, I've seen him around.


161
00:11:30.993 --> 00:11:32.619
He used to be a cop.

162
00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:41.836
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on a Christmas tree.


163
00:11:42.004 --> 00:11:44.631
All right.
Put your camera right there.


164
00:11:44.798 --> 00:11:49.093
When I walk out, I'll stop here. Get
the movie premiere in the background.


165
00:11:49.303 --> 00:11:52.180
I like it. I like it.
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."


166
00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:55.433
When I walk out, I don't want
those floodlights in my eyes.


167
00:11:55.643 --> 00:11:58.186
Big V, consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?


168
00:11:58.354 --> 00:12:00.688
All right, come on.
Get down.


169
00:12:04.818 --> 00:12:06.736
Go. Pop them.

170
00:12:10.074 --> 00:12:11.324
Freeze. Police.

171
00:12:12.242 --> 00:12:15.995
Hold it.
- Come on. Come on, let's go.


172
00:12:16.163 --> 00:12:17.372
I got my family coming --

173
00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:20.833
- it'll be a nice Christmas gift.
- Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.


174
00:12:21.043 --> 00:12:22.085
Right over here.

175
00:12:22.294 --> 00:12:24.337
- Just turn.
- Hold it. Got it.


176
00:12:25.297 --> 00:12:29.467
- "The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."
- Take them in. I'll get the evidence.


177
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.232
It's Christmas Eve
in the City of Angels ...


178
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.652
and while decent citizens
sleep the sleep of the righteous ...


179
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:50.279
hopheads prowl for marijuana ...

180
00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:53.825
not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:


181
00:12:54.284 --> 00:12:57.745
Celebrity crime-stopper
Jack Vincennes ...


182
00:12:57.913 --> 00:13:02.709
scourge of grasshoppers
and dope fiends everywhere.


183
00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:05.253
You like it, Jackie boy?

184
00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:08.715
Yeah, subtle.

185
00:13:09.383 --> 00:13:10.425
What took you?

186
00:13:10.592 --> 00:13:13.469
My partner stopped
to help a damsel in distress.


187
00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:16.305
His priorities are all screwed up.

188
00:13:16.473 --> 00:13:18.266
Up to your old tricks again, Bud?

189
00:13:18.684 --> 00:13:19.767
Bye.

190
00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:23.646
Hollywood Jack, what brings
you to our humble station house?


191
00:13:23.814 --> 00:13:25.606
- How are you?
- What are you doing here?


192
00:13:25.774 --> 00:13:27.775
You know me.
Keeping the streets safe, boys.


193
00:13:27.985 --> 00:13:30.445
Take these two,
get them dressed and book them.


194
00:13:30.738 --> 00:13:33.364
- The party's upstairs.
- Okay, I'll be right up. Exley.


195
00:13:39.538 --> 00:13:40.580
What's that for?

196
00:13:40.748 --> 00:13:43.249
Well, you are watch commander tonight,
aren't you?


197
00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:44.500
Yeah. So?

198
00:13:44.668 --> 00:13:48.171
A gratuity from Hush-Hush magazine.
Buy yourself a new pair of loafers.


199
00:13:48.422 --> 00:13:50.882
No, thanks, Jack.
You keep your payoff.


200
00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:52.800
I'm not interested.

201
00:14:00.976 --> 00:14:03.895
- What the hell's this?
- Six spics.


202
00:14:04.063 --> 00:14:07.440
Mexicans, sir. The ones who assaulted
Brown and Helenowski.


203
00:14:07.608 --> 00:14:10.610
I heard Helenowski lost six pints of blood
and Brown's in a coma.


204
00:14:10.778 --> 00:14:12.487
They're home with bruises.

205
00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:15.406
- That's not what I heard.
- Get these men into the lockup.


206
00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:20.369
Stens, you guys hear what those taco
benders did to Helenowski and Brown?


207
00:14:21.622 --> 00:14:26.167
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're
reading Brown his last rites.


208
00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:31.255
That ought to make for a very merry
Christmas for Helenowski and Brown.


209
00:14:31.423 --> 00:14:35.635
Hey, guys. Guys.
They brought the Mexicans in.


210
00:14:37.012 --> 00:14:38.346
They're downstairs.

211
00:14:40.849 --> 00:14:43.518
- Let's do it.
- Come on, guys. Let's get them.


212
00:14:46.313 --> 00:14:48.147
Stensland, the party's upstairs.

213
00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:51.484
This doesn't concern you.

214
00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:55.029
Come on, guys.
Haven't you got work to do?


215
00:14:55.197 --> 00:14:56.364
Go back to the party.

216
00:14:57.658 --> 00:15:00.868
- Come on, it's Christmas. Help me out.
- Out of the way. Move it.


217
00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:05.164
- I just got a few more questions.
- You don't all have to be down here.


218
00:15:05.707 --> 00:15:06.707
Go.

219
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:12.547
Hey, White? You better put a leash
on your partner before he kills somebody.


220
00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:17.677
- Teach him a lesson.
Get him, Stens.


221
00:15:18.846 --> 00:15:20.888
This is for ours, Pancho.

222
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.391
Get him, Stens.

223
00:15:23.684 --> 00:15:24.725
Let me through.

224
00:15:26.562 --> 00:15:28.020
No. He didn't do nothing.

225
00:15:28.188 --> 00:15:30.857
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?


226
00:15:31.525 --> 00:15:34.068
- Tell that Mexican to shut up.
- Move. Move.


227
00:15:34.486 --> 00:15:35.528
You're sick.

228
00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:39.574
Stens!

229
00:15:39.825 --> 00:15:43.327
- Stens. Hey. Hey. Come on. Come on.
- Don't break it up.


230
00:15:43.912 --> 00:15:45.288
Get back. Get back.

231
00:15:45.747 --> 00:15:48.416
- Yeah, and fuck your mother.
- Fuck you.


232
00:15:51.086 --> 00:15:53.504
- Come on!
- Stop, officer. That's an order.


233
00:15:55.591 --> 00:15:57.175
Hey.

234
00:15:59.094 --> 00:16:00.970
Yeah, all right.

235
00:16:02.514 --> 00:16:05.016
- You're all going in my report.
- Let's go, Exley.


236
00:16:24.077 --> 00:16:25.453
"Bloody Christmas."

237
00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:28.497
The press love to label.

238
00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:32.126
You should know this is bigger
than the police board.


239
00:16:32.294 --> 00:16:36.464
The grand jury's convening.
Indictments may be handed down.


240
00:16:36.798 --> 00:16:39.467
- Will you testify?
- No, sir. I won't.


241
00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:44.764
District Attorney Loew?

242
00:16:44.932 --> 00:16:48.768
You and Officer Stensland
brought the liquor to the station.


243
00:16:48.936 --> 00:16:51.270
Stensland was already drunk.

244
00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:54.315
Do you see how appearing as a
voluntary witness against him ...


245
00:16:54.483 --> 00:16:57.068
could offset the damage
you've done to yourself?


246
00:16:57.236 --> 00:16:59.987
Sir, I won't testify against my partner
or anyone else.


247
00:17:00.155 --> 00:17:02.156
This man is a disgrace.

248
00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:06.160
Your badge and gun, officer.
You're suspended from duty.


249
00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:09.538
Dismissed.

250
00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:26.681
Ed.

251
00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:30.059
We need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the department.


252
00:17:30.227 --> 00:17:32.603
- I'm asking you --
- Justice has to be served.


253
00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:34.355
Of course I'll testify.

254
00:17:37.442 --> 00:17:40.486
I'm glad you feel that way, Edmund.
Most of the men don't.


255
00:17:40.696 --> 00:17:43.364
They think silence and integrity
are the same thing.


256
00:17:43.782 --> 00:17:48.828
Not exactly the image of the new L.A.P.D.
we're trying to create.


257
00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:51.998
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.


258
00:17:52.207 --> 00:17:54.792
- May I make a suggestion, sir?
- By all means.


259
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.712
The public will expect the department
to protect its own ...


260
00:17:57.879 --> 00:18:01.215
and sweep this under the carpet.
Don't.


261
00:18:01.717 --> 00:18:04.677
Shift the guilt to men
whose pensions are secured.


262
00:18:04.845 --> 00:18:06.554
Force them to retire.

263
00:18:07.848 --> 00:18:13.227
But somebody has to swing,
so indict, try and convict ...


264
00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:15.229
Richard Stensland and Bud White.

265
00:18:15.689 --> 00:18:19.233
Secure them jail time.
The message will be very clear:


266
00:18:19.818 --> 00:18:22.236
This department, your new L.A.P.D ...

267
00:18:22.404 --> 00:18:25.573
will not tolerate officers
who think they're above the law.


268
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:28.784
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman.


269
00:18:28.994 --> 00:18:32.663
He's had rotten fitness reports
from every CO he's served under ...


270
00:18:33.248 --> 00:18:35.249
but Bud White is a valuable officer.

271
00:18:35.417 --> 00:18:37.084
White's a mindless thug.

272
00:18:37.252 --> 00:18:39.045
No, Edmund.

273
00:18:39.254 --> 00:18:43.257
He's just a man who can answer "yes"
to those questions I've asked you.


274
00:18:43.842 --> 00:18:46.844
The department and the
public need role models.


275
00:18:47.012 --> 00:18:50.097
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.


276
00:18:51.767 --> 00:18:54.852
Sergeant, I'll promote you ...

277
00:18:55.103 --> 00:18:58.314
to lieutenant, effective immediately.

278
00:18:58.482 --> 00:18:59.774
Detective lieutenant.

279
00:19:02.027 --> 00:19:03.652
Ed, you're 30.

280
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.573
Your father didn't make lieutenant
until he was 33.


281
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:08.866
I know that, sir.

282
00:19:09.034 --> 00:19:11.744
I also know when he made lieutenant,
it was as a detective.


283
00:19:11.912 --> 00:19:14.330
Before we start polishing our laurels ...

284
00:19:14.539 --> 00:19:17.124
it'd look better if we had
a corroborative witness.


285
00:19:17.626 --> 00:19:21.087
That won't be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.


286
00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:23.130
Jack Vincennes.

287
00:19:23.298 --> 00:19:26.050
He hit one of the Mexicans
and saw the whole thing.


288
00:19:26.218 --> 00:19:29.887
A veteran like Vincennes might be
willing to admit his own culpability ...


289
00:19:30.389 --> 00:19:32.640
but he'd never rat out
a fellow officer.


290
00:19:33.308 --> 00:19:36.352
Jack's the technical adviser
on "Badge of Honor".


291
00:19:36.561 --> 00:19:37.895
He lives for it.

292
00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:39.814
That's the way to get to him.

293
00:19:43.276 --> 00:19:45.486
I'd like you to observe, Ed.

294
00:19:49.157 --> 00:19:50.741
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

295
00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:52.993
Bright kid.

296
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:55.162
You may well reap the benefit, Ed ...

297
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.249
but are you prepared to be despised
in the department?


298
00:19:58.917 --> 00:20:00.334
Yes, sir, I am.

299
00:20:02.337 --> 00:20:03.337
So be it.

300
00:20:09.594 --> 00:20:11.929
Well, sergeant, we'll get right to it.

301
00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:16.434
Nine civilian witnesses have identified
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.


302
00:20:16.601 --> 00:20:19.019
But we have a stellar witness
who will name names ...


303
00:20:19.187 --> 00:20:22.815
and also testify that you hit back
only after being hit.


304
00:20:22.983 --> 00:20:26.193
- And?
- And you will testify against three officers ...


305
00:20:26.361 --> 00:20:28.320
who have already
earned their pension ...


306
00:20:28.488 --> 00:20:31.115
and plead ignorance
to questions at the other men.


307
00:20:31.533 --> 00:20:33.534
No, thanks.
I'm not a snitch.


308
00:20:33.702 --> 00:20:37.204
I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist,
a brief suspension ...


309
00:20:37.372 --> 00:20:40.708
followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.


310
00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:43.794
When you transfer out of Vice,
you'll be back on the show.


311
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.842
The show?

312
00:20:50.385 --> 00:20:52.052
"Badge of Honor", Vincennes.

313
00:20:53.638 --> 00:20:56.474
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.


314
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.726
Jack ...

315
00:20:58.894 --> 00:21:03.189
I doubt you've ever taken
a stupid breath. Don't start now.


316
00:21:03.732 --> 00:21:05.024
Okay, I'll do it.

317
00:21:08.403 --> 00:21:11.155
The grand jury will hear
your testimony tomorrow.


318
00:21:11.323 --> 00:21:12.740
Dismissed, Vincennes.

319
00:21:24.002 --> 00:21:26.003
And so it goes ...

320
00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:28.255
detective lieutenant.

321
00:21:30.008 --> 00:21:32.510
Ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow, son.


322
00:21:32.761 --> 00:21:35.513
Wear a smart-looking suit
and ace them.


323
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:39.433
And, Ed, lose the glasses.

324
00:21:49.778 --> 00:21:52.530
So you're the stellar witness.

325
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:56.367
I should have known.
What's the chief throwing you?


326
00:21:56.743 --> 00:21:59.870
- Throwing me?
- Yeah, Exley, what's the payoff?


327
00:22:00.205 --> 00:22:02.039
You're the payoff expert.

328
00:22:02.457 --> 00:22:03.499
I'm just doing my duty.

329
00:22:03.708 --> 00:22:07.253
Come on, you're playing an angle here,
college boy, right?


330
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.589
You're getting something so you
don't have to hobnob with cops ...


331
00:22:10.757 --> 00:22:12.591
who are gonna hate you
for snitching.


332
00:22:12.968 --> 00:22:15.553
Well, if they're making you detective,
watch out.


333
00:22:16.054 --> 00:22:17.972
Some bureau guys
are gonna burn in this ...


334
00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:20.307
and you're gonna work
with friends of theirs.


335
00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:21.892
What about you?

336
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.313
I'm snitching three old-timers who'll be
fishing in Oregon next week.


337
00:22:26.648 --> 00:22:28.566
Next to you, I'm clean ...

338
00:22:28.817 --> 00:22:29.984
and smart.

339
00:22:30.151 --> 00:22:32.820
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

340
00:22:35.156 --> 00:22:36.198
And remember ...

341
00:22:36.408 --> 00:22:39.868
Bud White will fuck you for this
if it takes him the rest of his life.


342
00:22:43.748 --> 00:22:45.332
Captain, what do you want?

343
00:22:46.501 --> 00:22:47.751
Call me Dudley.

344
00:22:48.253 --> 00:22:51.422
Dudley, what do you want?

345
00:22:52.674 --> 00:22:56.176
Look, lad, I admire
your refusal to testify ...


346
00:22:56.595 --> 00:22:58.596
and your loyalty to your partner.

347
00:22:59.097 --> 00:23:01.056
I admire you as a policeman ...

348
00:23:01.266 --> 00:23:05.686
particularly your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job.


349
00:23:05.854 --> 00:23:09.106
And I'm most impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.


350
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.358
Do you hate them, Wendell?

351
00:23:13.945 --> 00:23:15.112
What do you want?

352
00:23:19.618 --> 00:23:21.035
They're yours.

353
00:23:22.454 --> 00:23:24.288
Go ahead, take them.

354
00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:28.417
There's no goddamn bill on me?

355
00:23:28.627 --> 00:23:31.211
- Four witnesses recanted their testimony.
- Why?


356
00:23:31.379 --> 00:23:33.714
- They had a change of heart.
- What about Stensland?


357
00:23:34.215 --> 00:23:35.799
Your partner's through.

358
00:23:36.051 --> 00:23:38.177
Departmental scapegoat
on the chief's orders.


359
00:23:38.345 --> 00:23:40.304
A year from his pension.

360
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:44.433
Exley.

361
00:23:44.601 --> 00:23:46.685
Exley made his play
and got what he wanted.


362
00:23:46.853 --> 00:23:50.230
As a politician, he exceeds even myself.

363
00:23:51.066 --> 00:23:53.901
The department needs
smart men like Exley ...


364
00:23:54.402 --> 00:23:57.655
and direct men like you.

365
00:23:59.074 --> 00:24:03.077
Look, lad, I need you for an assignment
the chief's given me the go-ahead on.


366
00:24:03.244 --> 00:24:07.539
A duty few men are fit for,
but you were born for.


367
00:24:08.249 --> 00:24:10.876
You'd be working out of Homicide
down at City Hall.


368
00:24:11.086 --> 00:24:12.252
Homicide?

369
00:24:13.254 --> 00:24:14.755
Working cases?

370
00:24:15.924 --> 00:24:18.509
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.

371
00:24:19.094 --> 00:24:20.719
It's a muscle job.

372
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:27.101
You'll do as I say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?


373
00:24:27.352 --> 00:24:29.436
In Technicolor, sir.

374
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.983
Meet Tony Brancato
and Anthony Trombino ...


375
00:24:35.193 --> 00:24:38.487
two rising lieutenants
in the Mickey Cohen rackets.


376
00:24:38.697 --> 00:24:40.739
With the dapper little gent in prison ...

377
00:24:40.907 --> 00:24:45.119
who knows how far they'll go?
The sky's the limit.


378
00:24:51.751 --> 00:24:52.793
Oh, well.

379
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.352
Meet Deuce Perkins,
Mickey Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.


380
00:25:10.562 --> 00:25:11.979
Could he be behind the hits?

381
00:25:12.731 --> 00:25:15.566
Is he consolidating
organized-crime power?


382
00:25:21.656 --> 00:25:23.323
I suppose not.

383
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.372
One thing's for sure:

384
00:25:30.582 --> 00:25:33.834
Two-man triggers are punching the tickets
on the Mickster's muscle.


385
00:25:44.512 --> 00:25:47.097
Meanwhile, rumor has it the L.A.P.D ...

386
00:25:47.265 --> 00:25:52.144
has set up a not-so-welcome wagon to
dishearten out-of-town criminal element ...


387
00:25:52.353 --> 00:25:55.647
from filling the void left by
Mickey's absence.


388
00:25:55.857 --> 00:25:58.776
When I know more, dear readers,
so will you.


389
00:25:59.027 --> 00:26:01.695
Off the record, on the q.t. ...

390
00:26:02.113 --> 00:26:05.699
and very hush-hush.

391
00:26:06.868 --> 00:26:10.871
With Mickey Cohen in prison,
Los Angeles is organized-crime free.


392
00:26:11.206 --> 00:26:12.956
The chief wants to keep it that way.

393
00:26:14.334 --> 00:26:17.294
Now, in Cleveland, you're an
organized-crime associate ...


394
00:26:17.462 --> 00:26:21.298
in desperate needs of re-education
in the ways of polite society.


395
00:26:23.718 --> 00:26:25.511
I hear things.

396
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.679
Like those two-man shooter teams.

397
00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:31.725
Bang, bang. They're eighty-sixing Cohen's
lieutenants. Tell me, what do you want?


398
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.311
We want you to go home.

399
00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:40.692
Picture-book smut, gentlemen.

400
00:26:40.902 --> 00:26:44.571
There's been a bunch of this
found at collateral crime scenes lately.


401
00:26:44.823 --> 00:26:49.868
Quality ranges from piss-poor
to very well done.


402
00:26:50.787 --> 00:26:53.497
- Look who's back from suspension.
- Here, Jack.


403
00:26:53.665 --> 00:26:55.707
We're honored, 
Sergeant Jack.

404
00:26:55.917 --> 00:26:59.336
Ah, look at that.
The great jerk-off case of 1953.


405
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:01.880
There someplace you'd rather be,
Vincennes?


406
00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:05.592
Yeah, working Narcotics,
looking for Cohen's missing H.


407
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.972
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.


408
00:27:10.181 --> 00:27:12.641
Maybe you should've thought of that
before "Bloody Christmas."


409
00:27:12.809 --> 00:27:13.934
Oh.

410
00:27:14.352 --> 00:27:16.270
Make a major case, sergeant.

411
00:27:16.437 --> 00:27:18.939
It's the only way
you're getting out of here.


412
00:27:19.691 --> 00:27:21.108
Dismissed, gentlemen.

413
00:27:29.284 --> 00:27:31.243
Go get the facts, Jack.

414
00:27:31.452 --> 00:27:33.287
Just the facts.

415
00:27:40.795 --> 00:27:42.337
Whatever you desire.

416
00:27:42.547 --> 00:27:45.299
Hi. I'd like to get a delivery
to Beverly Hills.


417
00:27:45.508 --> 00:27:46.592
I don't know you.

418
00:27:47.135 --> 00:27:50.304
Well, a friend just gave me this number
and I just wanted to find out if --


419
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.685
Ginger, you grab a reverse directory
and shag a name and address for me?


420
00:27:56.895 --> 00:27:58.812
Crestview 2239.

421
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.405
Hush-Hush, off the record,
on the q.t.


422
00:28:08.823 --> 00:28:10.574
Sid, it's Vincennes.

423
00:28:10.742 --> 00:28:14.161
Jackie! Hey, you back on Narco?
I need some good copy.


424
00:28:14.329 --> 00:28:16.413
No, but I do
have something going with Vice.


425
00:28:16.581 --> 00:28:18.206
Something juicy for the Sidster?

426
00:28:18.416 --> 00:28:20.667
Tracking porn.
Arty, high-class stuff.


427
00:28:20.835 --> 00:28:24.004
What do you know about Fleur-de-Lis?
Slogan's "Whatever you desire."


428
00:28:24.172 --> 00:28:25.797
No, I've heard bupkes.

429
00:28:26.007 --> 00:28:29.676
Get me some Narco skinny.
I want to do an all-hophead issue.


430
00:28:29.844 --> 00:28:33.764
Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.
You like it?


431
00:28:33.932 --> 00:28:36.266
Yeah, I'll talk to you later, Sid.
What do you got?


432
00:28:36.434 --> 00:28:39.519
- Number's not assigned, sergeant.
- Thanks, Ginger.


433
00:28:41.356 --> 00:28:42.689
A bootleg.

434
00:28:49.656 --> 00:28:51.198
Hey.

435
00:28:51.783 --> 00:28:52.991
Take it easy.

436
00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:54.660
Tough break, Stens.

437
00:28:54.869 --> 00:28:56.995
Good man.
We're gonna miss you around here.


438
00:28:57.205 --> 00:28:58.872
Raw deal, Stensland.

439
00:29:02.168 --> 00:29:04.044
Here comes the snitch.

440
00:29:15.223 --> 00:29:16.848
Sorry about that, lieutenant.

441
00:29:33.825 --> 00:29:35.659
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

442
00:29:38.162 --> 00:29:40.372
I got a couple hours.
I'll buy you a drink.


443
00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.708
- Rain check. No, I got a hot date.
- Come on.


444
00:29:43.668 --> 00:29:46.920
Yeah? Who is she
and what did you arrest her for?


445
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.797
It's confidential.

446
00:29:49.007 --> 00:29:53.927
Like that magazine that Vincennes
scams for. Hush-Hush.


447
00:29:55.096 --> 00:29:56.930
I'll see you later in the week.

448
00:29:57.515 --> 00:29:59.474
We'll do the town, on me.

449
00:29:59.684 --> 00:30:02.686
Yeah. I'll bring my wallet
just in case.


450
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:09.192
- See you tomorrow.
- Hang on a minute.


451
00:30:10.028 --> 00:30:11.445
I'll walk down with you.

452
00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:22.789
- Punk kid.
Who the hell is he trying to impress?


453
00:30:23.708 --> 00:30:27.461
- Yeah, I wonder.
- Got himself a real career going.


454
00:30:31.716 --> 00:30:34.134
Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.

455
00:30:35.303 --> 00:30:36.970
Sergeant Williams?

456
00:30:40.224 --> 00:30:43.060
Is there anybody up there in Homicide?

457
00:30:44.062 --> 00:30:45.645
Anybody there?

458
00:30:47.899 --> 00:30:49.107
Lieutenant Exley.

459
00:30:49.317 --> 00:30:51.276
You've got a homicide downtown.

460
00:30:51.486 --> 00:30:55.739
- The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
- I got it. it's mine.


461
00:31:07.335 --> 00:31:10.128
Sir, at least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee.


462
00:31:10.338 --> 00:31:12.672
No one comes through the front door.
Understand?


463
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.549
Yes, sir.

464
00:32:49.395 --> 00:32:52.063
I want barricades at both ends
of the street. Make sure --


465
00:32:52.231 --> 00:32:55.692
Sir? I took the call. It's my case.

466
00:32:56.277 --> 00:32:58.528
You don't want it, Edmund,
and you can't have it.


467
00:32:58.696 --> 00:33:01.740
- I took the call.
- It's mine.


468
00:33:02.116 --> 00:33:03.450
I'll make you
my second-in-command.


469
00:33:03.618 --> 00:33:05.452
Captain Smith? 
Over here, please.

470
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.455
- The back door.
- Nobody else inside.


471
00:33:10.291 --> 00:33:12.626
Looks like the cook drew a handgun
and set it off.


472
00:33:12.793 --> 00:33:14.711
The rest were killed in the men's room.

473
00:33:19.217 --> 00:33:20.383
Sir ...

474
00:33:20.635 --> 00:33:24.387
we got a total of 15 spent

475
00:33:24.555 --> 00:33:28.767
I'm betting three men, five-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.


476
00:33:28.935 --> 00:33:31.895
Excuse me, sir, we got an ID
on one of the victims.


477
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.897
It's Dick Stensland.

478
00:33:36.484 --> 00:33:39.027
When I first saw her, I thought
she was Rita Hayworth.


479
00:33:39.237 --> 00:33:40.654
Yeah, me too.

480
00:33:50.373 --> 00:33:52.499
Hell of a way to avoid
a prison sentence.


481
00:34:03.177 --> 00:34:04.469
You tell me what happened?

482
00:34:05.012 --> 00:34:07.597
Appears three men
held up a coffee shop.


483
00:34:07.807 --> 00:34:10.642
The guy at the register pulled a .38,
so they killed him.


484
00:34:11.143 --> 00:34:14.521
Then they took everyone else out back
and killed them too.


485
00:34:15.815 --> 00:34:18.858
Lieutenant, we're ready
with that Nite Owl ID.


486
00:34:24.365 --> 00:34:26.324
Is this your daughter, Mrs. Lefferts?

487
00:34:27.034 --> 00:34:28.702
I don't know.

488
00:34:29.495 --> 00:34:32.163
We know this is difficult.
Just take your time.


489
00:34:33.874 --> 00:34:36.209
It seems like my Susan ...

490
00:34:36.377 --> 00:34:39.337
but my Susan was a blond,
not a redhead.


491
00:34:39.505 --> 00:34:41.381
When was the last time you saw her?

492
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:43.842
Just before Christmas.

493
00:34:44.385 --> 00:34:47.304
We'd fought.
I didn't like her boyfriend.


494
00:34:47.888 --> 00:34:51.850
Mrs. Lefferts, does your daughter
have any distinguishing characteristics?


495
00:34:52.893 --> 00:34:55.854
You got the wrong idea, mister.
I'm fine.


496
00:34:56.689 --> 00:34:59.858
She has a birthmark on her hip.

497
00:35:05.698 --> 00:35:07.240
It's her.

498
00:35:07.908 --> 00:35:10.035
My baby.

499
00:35:13.247 --> 00:35:15.081
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.

500
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.668
Who's in charge of this investigation?

501
00:35:19.086 --> 00:35:20.587
Captain Smith and myself.
Why?


502
00:35:23.257 --> 00:35:24.674
"The Nite Owl Massacre."

503
00:35:24.842 --> 00:35:26.634
Hyperbole aside ...

504
00:35:26.844 --> 00:35:30.513
this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution.


505
00:35:31.432 --> 00:35:32.557
Six victims.

506
00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:35.435
One of them one of our own.
Dick Stensland.


507
00:35:35.603 --> 00:35:40.023
As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.


508
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:42.400
Robbery is the likely motive.

509
00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.694
We have rubber-glove smears
on the register ...


510
00:35:44.862 --> 00:35:48.823
and preliminary forensics strongly tend
towards a trio of shooters.


511
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:51.034
We do have one hot lead,
so listen well.


512
00:35:51.452 --> 00:35:53.411
Three Negro juveniles ...

513
00:35:53.621 --> 00:35:57.248
were seen discharging shotguns
last night in Griffith Park.


514
00:35:57.458 --> 00:36:01.503
A park ranger ID'd them as driving
a 1948 to 1950 Mercury coupe ...


515
00:36:01.712 --> 00:36:03.088
maroon in color.

516
00:36:03.547 --> 00:36:07.258
An hour ago, a canvassing crew
turned up a news vendor ...


517
00:36:07.426 --> 00:36:11.137
who saw a maroon Merc parked
across from the Nite Owl around 1 a.m.


518
00:36:11.639 --> 00:36:15.433
DMV has come up with
a registration list of Merc coupes.


519
00:36:16.644 --> 00:36:21.147
Forty-eight two-man teams will shake
three names apiece.


520
00:36:21.816 --> 00:36:24.442
Interrogations will be led by
Lieutenant Edmund Exley.


521
00:36:27.905 --> 00:36:29.656
Enough on that.

522
00:36:32.493 --> 00:36:36.162
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.


523
00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:39.499
The people of Los Angeles demand it.

524
00:36:40.126 --> 00:36:41.459
Dismissed.

525
00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:46.840
Why not just put a bounty on them?

526
00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.432
You ready to roll?

527
00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:57.350
Take them.
I got something I gotta do.


528
00:36:57.518 --> 00:37:01.187
- What if one of these names --?
- Get somebody else.


529
00:37:02.022 --> 00:37:04.274
Well, I got our assignments, Big V.

530
00:37:04.483 --> 00:37:07.527
We go by this list, we got
zero chance of making this collar.


531
00:37:07.695 --> 00:37:10.363
I got a guy who knows what's going on
south of Jefferson.


532
00:37:10.531 --> 00:37:13.825
- He can put us at fifty-fifty.
- Jack, what are you doing?


533
00:37:14.285 --> 00:37:16.870
Same sort of thing
that got you in trouble last time.


534
00:37:17.037 --> 00:37:18.496
I'll take those odds.

535
00:37:22.543 --> 00:37:24.043
We got it from here.

536
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.715
Between the two of you,
you should bring a photographer.


537
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:37.223
I need an address on a customer
of yours. Her name is Lynn.


538
00:37:37.391 --> 00:37:39.225
- That's all I got to go on?
- Yeah.


539
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.061
I think you already know who I mean,
so cough it up.


540
00:37:42.396 --> 00:37:45.565
There's a billing address
and a delivery address.


541
00:38:12.259 --> 00:38:14.052
Are you Pierce Patchett?

542
00:38:15.095 --> 00:38:16.429
I am.

543
00:38:18.432 --> 00:38:22.560
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called at my office.


544
00:38:22.937 --> 00:38:25.897
Go on down to the driveway.
We'll talk there.


545
00:38:36.909 --> 00:38:38.451
What can I do for you?

546
00:38:39.453 --> 00:38:43.081
- Where were you last night?
- I was here hosting a party.


547
00:38:44.792 --> 00:38:48.920
- Tell me about Dick Stensland.
- I don't know him, Mr ...?


548
00:38:49.255 --> 00:38:50.630
Officer White.

549
00:38:51.715 --> 00:38:52.966
Sue Lefferts? You know her?

550
00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.593
You know I do.
You saw me with her.


551
00:38:57.304 --> 00:38:58.972
How did you find me?

552
00:38:59.598 --> 00:39:03.768
Nick's Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.


553
00:39:03.978 --> 00:39:05.603
Of course.

554
00:39:08.482 --> 00:39:10.650
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

555
00:39:11.277 --> 00:39:12.944
I'm investigating.

556
00:39:15.114 --> 00:39:18.992
- Everything all right?
- Fine, Phillip. Thank you.


557
00:39:23.163 --> 00:39:25.748
What happened to the other guy, Buzz?

558
00:39:25.916 --> 00:39:28.334
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.

559
00:39:28.502 --> 00:39:31.087
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve
but didn't act it.


560
00:39:31.255 --> 00:39:34.257
I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is --


561
00:39:34.425 --> 00:39:37.010
Was a big doubles fan.

562
00:39:37.845 --> 00:39:40.847
You're a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder.


563
00:39:41.682 --> 00:39:44.142
Wanna go downtown
and discuss this officially?


564
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.019
Is that what this is? Official?

565
00:39:46.812 --> 00:39:51.357
Somehow I have the feeling this is more
personal with you, Mr. White.


566
00:39:54.653 --> 00:39:56.154
All right, then ...

567
00:39:56.989 --> 00:40:01.451
are you concerned about criminal matters
peripheral to the Nite Owl murders?


568
00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:05.038
- Not at the moment.
- You wouldn't feel obligated to report them?


569
00:40:07.374 --> 00:40:09.542
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

570
00:40:09.877 --> 00:40:12.712
I needed a Rita Hayworth
to fill out my little studio.


571
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.047
What little studio?

572
00:40:14.214 --> 00:40:17.884
Well, there's Gardner, Russell,
Monroe, Turner ...


573
00:40:18.052 --> 00:40:20.386
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.

574
00:40:20.888 --> 00:40:23.389
I use girls that look like movie stars.

575
00:40:23.557 --> 00:40:26.184
Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.

576
00:40:26.727 --> 00:40:29.187
When the work had been done,
that's when you saw us.


577
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.731
That's why her mother couldn't ID her.

578
00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:34.817
Jesus fucking Christ.

579
00:40:35.027 --> 00:40:37.070
No, Mr. White,
Pierce Morehouse Patchett.


580
00:40:39.406 --> 00:40:42.909
I sense you're on your best behavior,
but that's all I'm gonna tell you.


581
00:40:43.285 --> 00:40:45.411
If you persist,
I'll meet you with my attorney.


582
00:40:46.538 --> 00:40:48.748
Now, would you like
Lynn Bracken's address?


583
00:40:48.916 --> 00:40:50.583
I got her address.

584
00:40:51.877 --> 00:40:53.920
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.

585
00:40:54.421 --> 00:40:56.547
I'll give you a handsome reward.

586
00:41:01.887 --> 00:41:03.971
Whatever you desire.

587
00:41:11.438 --> 00:41:13.022
Come on.
I know you're not asleep.


588
00:41:15.442 --> 00:41:17.443
You talking to me?
What do you want?


589
00:41:17.611 --> 00:41:19.278
My 5 bucks.

590
00:41:19.446 --> 00:41:21.906
It was the only one I had.

591
00:41:22.116 --> 00:41:23.282
Right now?

592
00:41:23.784 --> 00:41:26.285
Hey, doll face,
tell him to leave us alone.


593
00:41:26.453 --> 00:41:28.788
I understand.
Okay, fine.


594
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:31.457
Oh, baby ...

595
00:41:32.751 --> 00:41:34.127
bad news.

596
00:41:34.294 --> 00:41:35.461
You have to go.

597
00:41:35.629 --> 00:41:36.796
Go?

598
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:39.799
Something very important has come up
and you have to go ...


599
00:41:39.967 --> 00:41:42.719
but I'll make it up to you, okay?

600
00:41:44.096 --> 00:41:45.471
I will, I promise. Excuse me.

601
00:41:47.975 --> 00:41:49.434
Is it the cops?

602
00:41:53.981 --> 00:41:56.482
Miss Bracken, I'm Officer White.

603
00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:59.277
I've been expecting you,
just not this soon.


604
00:41:59.445 --> 00:42:02.155
Pierce called.
He told me what happened to Sue.


605
00:42:02.322 --> 00:42:05.491
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?


606
00:42:05.826 --> 00:42:07.660
Hit the road, pal.

607
00:42:09.163 --> 00:42:10.621
Maybe I will ...

608
00:42:11.165 --> 00:42:12.623
maybe I won't.

609
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.627
L.A.P.D., shit-bird. Get out of here
or I'll call your wife to come get you.


610
00:42:33.187 --> 00:42:34.771
- Officer.
- Councilman.


611
00:42:53.373 --> 00:42:56.876
- Would you care for a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch straight.


612
00:43:02.674 --> 00:43:06.344
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.


613
00:43:06.678 --> 00:43:08.012
You know what I mean?

614
00:43:08.388 --> 00:43:10.056
You sorry she's dead?

615
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.351
Of course I am.

616
00:43:13.685 --> 00:43:15.561
What kind of question is that?

617
00:43:17.731 --> 00:43:20.024
Do you know why Pierce
is humoring you?


618
00:43:20.234 --> 00:43:22.568
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.


619
00:43:22.903 --> 00:43:25.530
- But do you know?
- Yeah, I know.


620
00:43:26.532 --> 00:43:31.661
Patchett's running whores
cut to look like movie stars.


621
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:35.373
And judging by his address,
probably something bigger on the side.


622
00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:37.416
He doesn't want any attention.

623
00:43:37.709 --> 00:43:41.254
That's right. Our motives are selfish,
so we're cooperating.


624
00:43:41.421 --> 00:43:44.340
So cooperate. Why was
Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?


625
00:43:44.758 --> 00:43:47.385
I don't know. I never heard of
the Nite Owl till today.


626
00:43:47.553 --> 00:43:50.513
- How did she meet Patchett?
- Pierce meets people.


627
00:43:50.722 --> 00:43:54.559
Sue came on a bus with dreams of
Hollywood and this is how they turned out.


628
00:43:55.102 --> 00:43:58.938
Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little.


629
00:43:59.439 --> 00:44:01.774
Tell me about Pierce.

630
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:04.193
He's waiting for you to mention money.

631
00:44:05.404 --> 00:44:08.573
- You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
- It's Lynn.


632
00:44:08.949 --> 00:44:13.411
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking
bribe me or threaten me ...


633
00:44:13.579 --> 00:44:16.205
or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.


634
00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:19.750
I remember you from Christmas Eve.

635
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:24.130
You have a thing for helping women,
don't you, Officer White?


636
00:44:24.965 --> 00:44:26.757
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

637
00:44:27.092 --> 00:44:30.428
- You say "fuck" a lot.
- You fuck for money.


638
00:44:30.637 --> 00:44:34.265
There's blood on your shirt.
Is that an integral part of your job?


639
00:44:34.433 --> 00:44:36.142
- Yeah.
- Do you enjoy it?


640
00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.061
- When they deserve it.
- Did they deserve it today?


641
00:44:40.772 --> 00:44:41.814
I'm not sure.

642
00:44:41.982 --> 00:44:43.482
- But you did it anyway.
- Yeah.


643
00:44:44.276 --> 00:44:46.485
Just like the half-dozen guys
you screwed today.


644
00:44:47.779 --> 00:44:49.822
Well, actually, it was only two.

645
00:44:52.284 --> 00:44:54.243
You're different, 
Officer White.

646
00:44:54.411 --> 00:44:58.956
You're the first man in five years
who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake.


647
00:44:59.124 --> 00:45:00.917
You look better than Veronica Lake.

648
00:45:06.465 --> 00:45:07.506
Pierce Patchett?

649
00:45:09.176 --> 00:45:12.011
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.


650
00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:15.348
He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.


651
00:45:15.682 --> 00:45:19.852
Can your policeman's mentality
grasp those contradictions?


652
00:45:21.688 --> 00:45:24.023
He had you cut
to look like Veronica Lake.


653
00:45:24.191 --> 00:45:25.650
No.

654
00:45:25.817 --> 00:45:28.986
I'm really a brunette,
but the rest is me.


655
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:33.157
And that's all the news
that's fit to print.


656
00:45:34.368 --> 00:45:36.786
It was nice meeting you, officer.

657
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:44.835
- I'd like to see you again.
- You asking for a date, or an appointment?


658
00:45:46.838 --> 00:45:48.130
I don't know.

659
00:45:48.298 --> 00:45:51.968
- For a date, I should know your first name.
- Forget I asked.


660
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:54.512
It was a mistake.

661
00:46:15.075 --> 00:46:16.534
Leonard Bidwell?

662
00:46:17.703 --> 00:46:19.704
Come on down here and talk to us.

663
00:46:21.748 --> 00:46:24.667
- How's the left these days?
- What's it to you?


664
00:46:24.835 --> 00:46:28.546
Oh, I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.
I like your style.


665
00:46:31.049 --> 00:46:32.925
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

666
00:46:33.719 --> 00:46:36.262
You got a brother in Folsom.
I know, I put him there.


667
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:37.513
Until 19-fucking-70.

668
00:46:37.723 --> 00:46:39.765
How'd you like to make it 1960?

669
00:46:40.058 --> 00:46:42.435
I know the judge,
and Lieutenant Exley here ...


670
00:46:42.602 --> 00:46:44.770
is very good friends with the DA.

671
00:46:45.772 --> 00:46:47.148
Yeah.

672
00:46:47.315 --> 00:46:50.776
We're looking for three colored guys
who like to pop off shotguns.


673
00:46:50.944 --> 00:46:53.112
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

674
00:46:53.447 --> 00:46:56.615
- Wanna give me a snitch jacket?
- Wanna buy your brother 10 years?


675
00:46:56.783 --> 00:46:58.701
- It was 10 years, right?
- Yeah, 10 years.


676
00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:02.121
You don't have to say anything,
just look at this list ...


677
00:47:02.456 --> 00:47:03.956
and point.

678
00:47:06.293 --> 00:47:08.294
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.

679
00:47:08.754 --> 00:47:10.129
Sugar Ray Collins.

680
00:47:10.297 --> 00:47:12.590
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.

681
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:14.759
Beautiful ride.

682
00:47:15.427 --> 00:47:19.638
Don't know about shotguns,
but he gets his thrills killing dogs.


683
00:47:19.931 --> 00:47:21.223
He's righteous trash.

684
00:47:21.641 --> 00:47:24.810
Look at that. It's five minutes
from here. Thanks.


685
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.481
So I'll hear from you, right?

686
00:47:29.483 --> 00:47:33.444
- About my brother?
- Keep it up, Lenny. Up.


687
00:47:39.451 --> 00:47:41.744
There it is. It's in the back.

688
00:47:59.012 --> 00:48:01.639
- One of ours.
- Shit, somebody beat us here.


689
00:48:07.687 --> 00:48:09.271
- Damn it.
- What?


690
00:48:09.439 --> 00:48:12.358
- My glasses.
- You're kidding.


691
00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.861
Well, just don't shoot me.

692
00:48:24.663 --> 00:48:26.497
What are you guys doing here?

693
00:48:27.499 --> 00:48:29.208
We were just in the neighborhood.

694
00:48:29.376 --> 00:48:30.376
What do you got?

695
00:48:30.544 --> 00:48:33.963
Three 12-gauge pumps, an empty box
of double-aught buck, and some cash.


696
00:48:36.299 --> 00:48:39.051
So long, Vice.
"Badge of Honor", here I come.


697
00:48:39.219 --> 00:48:42.388
- Fuck you, Vincennes. This is our collar.
- Quiet.


698
00:48:42.556 --> 00:48:46.225
I'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team. End of story.


699
00:48:51.523 --> 00:48:52.565
Yeah, right.

700
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.528
- How many ways in?
- Only one. Up the stairs.


701
00:48:58.905 --> 00:49:00.906
He's very serious.

702
00:49:15.422 --> 00:49:17.590
- Police.
- Don't shoot.


703
00:49:17.757 --> 00:49:19.341
No!

704
00:49:19.509 --> 00:49:20.759
- Don't move.
- Ace him, Jack.


705
00:49:20.927 --> 00:49:23.262
- Shut up.
- Anxious, aren't you?


706
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:24.555
Don't kill them.

707
00:49:26.141 --> 00:49:29.393
- Hey.
- Back, back, back.


708
00:49:29.561 --> 00:49:33.105
- Man, get off me.
- Against the wall. Against the wall.


709
00:49:33.273 --> 00:49:35.608
- Put your hands up.
- Get over there. Come on.


710
00:49:36.735 --> 00:49:38.569
Now, shut up. Hands behind your back.

711
00:49:39.738 --> 00:49:40.779
So ...

712
00:49:41.406 --> 00:49:44.116
how's it feel
getting out of the office?


713
00:49:50.123 --> 00:49:51.790
This just came up from Forensics.

714
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.459
"Burning clothes.

715
00:49:54.669 --> 00:49:56.795
Casitas Youth Camp ..."

716
00:50:00.175 --> 00:50:04.386
- it's crowded in here, White.
- These guys killed Stensland.


717
00:50:20.987 --> 00:50:23.822
Ejection marks on the shells
from the suspects' shotguns ...


718
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:27.159
are identical to the marks on the
shell casings at the Nite Owl.


719
00:50:27.494 --> 00:50:29.495
I want confessions, Edmund.

720
00:50:29.663 --> 00:50:32.665
A night's stewing
ought to have softened them up.


721
00:50:33.083 --> 00:50:34.833
Oh, I'll break them, sir.

722
00:50:54.854 --> 00:50:57.856
Are you sure Golden Boy
is up to the task, cap?


723
00:50:58.525 --> 00:51:01.527
Oh, I think you'd be surprised
what the lad is capable of.


724
00:51:03.863 --> 00:51:05.823
You're 22. Aren't you, Ray?

725
00:51:11.288 --> 00:51:13.038
Did one of the officers work you over?

726
00:51:15.458 --> 00:51:18.377
- You're 22, right?
- Why do you keep asking that?


727
00:51:18.545 --> 00:51:20.963
Twenty-two makes it
a gas-chamber bounce.


728
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:23.841
You should've pulled
this caper years ago.


729
00:51:24.009 --> 00:51:27.219
Get life,
do a little Youth Authority jolt ...


730
00:51:27.387 --> 00:51:29.305
transfer to Folsom a big man.

731
00:51:29.639 --> 00:51:33.642
- Get yourself a sissy ...
- Hey, I don't truck with no sissies.


732
00:51:36.563 --> 00:51:39.356
- Louis.
- What?


733
00:51:40.984 --> 00:51:43.569
You did the Casitas Youth Camp
with Louis.


734
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.656
Why do you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.


735
00:51:47.824 --> 00:51:51.327
Sugar, Louis told me
you went sissy up at Casitas.


736
00:51:51.494 --> 00:51:55.581
You couldn't do the time, so you got
a big white boy to look after you.


737
00:51:55.749 --> 00:52:00.419
Said they called you "Sugar"
because you gave it out so sweet.


738
00:52:01.254 --> 00:52:05.424
Louis gave it up at Casitas, man.
I was the boss jock in my dorm.


739
00:52:05.592 --> 00:52:06.675
Louis was the sissy.

740
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:11.096
Louis gave it up for fucking candy bars.
He ain't got the sense of a goddamn dog.


741
00:52:12.182 --> 00:52:16.185
- I heard you like to shoot dogs.
- Dogs got no reason to live.


742
00:52:18.188 --> 00:52:21.607
- You feel the same way about people too?
- What you trying to say?


743
00:52:22.025 --> 00:52:25.194
- We got the shotguns, Ray.
- I don't own no shotguns.


744
00:52:25.362 --> 00:52:27.738
Why were you throwing clothes
in the incinerator?


745
00:52:28.031 --> 00:52:29.073
Say what?

746
00:52:29.574 --> 00:52:34.036
A neighbor said she saw you throwing
clothes in the backyard incinerator.


747
00:52:34.245 --> 00:52:35.454
It doesn't look good.

748
00:52:35.622 --> 00:52:37.790
I ain't got shit to
say till I see a judge.

749
00:52:37.999 --> 00:52:41.543
Were you on hop? You were passed out
when we arrested you. You hopped up?


750
00:52:41.753 --> 00:52:44.296
Ty and Louis fuck with that shit,
not me.


751
00:52:44.506 --> 00:52:46.256
Where do they get their stuff?

752
00:52:47.592 --> 00:52:48.759
- Man ...
- Come on.


753
00:52:49.177 --> 00:52:52.388
Give me one to feed the DA.
It'll make me look good ...


754
00:52:52.597 --> 00:52:56.308
and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk
like his sissy partners.


755
00:53:01.564 --> 00:53:02.815
All right, Raymond.

756
00:53:02.982 --> 00:53:05.234
Tell me one more thing
about Jones and Fontaine.


757
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:06.902
Where do they get drugs?

758
00:53:09.948 --> 00:53:11.490
Roland Navarette.

759
00:53:13.076 --> 00:53:15.744
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.

760
00:53:15.912 --> 00:53:17.913
And he sells red devils.

761
00:53:18.706 --> 00:53:21.583
- Exley's good, I'll give him that.
- I'm gonna take a break.


762
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:28.674
You know, Ray,
I'm talking about the gas chamber ...


763
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:32.094
and you haven't even asked me
what this is about.


764
00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.389
You got a big "guilty" sign
around your neck.


765
00:53:40.145 --> 00:53:43.355
That was masterful, Edmund.
This one's ready to go.


766
00:53:51.197 --> 00:53:53.782
Give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.


767
00:53:53.992 --> 00:53:56.326
Take the cuffs off,
so he can read it.

768
00:53:56.870 --> 00:54:00.664
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.


769
00:54:00.832 --> 00:54:04.543
I think it was Ray's idea.
You talk, I think I can save your life.


770
00:54:06.004 --> 00:54:08.881
Son, six people are dead,
and someone has to pay for it.


771
00:54:09.048 --> 00:54:12.009
Now, it can be you,
or it can be Ray.


772
00:54:14.179 --> 00:54:16.013
Louis, he called you queer.

773
00:54:16.347 --> 00:54:20.184
- Said at Casitas, you took it up the ass.
- I didn't kill nobody!


774
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.687
Son ...

775
00:54:25.523 --> 00:54:28.150
you know what's gonna happen to you
if you don't talk.


776
00:54:28.318 --> 00:54:32.237
You'll go to the gas chamber.
So for God's sake, admit what you did.


777
00:54:32.405 --> 00:54:34.156
I didn't mean to hurt her.

778
00:54:34.365 --> 00:54:37.201
- Maybe she's okay.
- Okay?


779
00:54:38.369 --> 00:54:41.830
These people are all in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.


780
00:54:41.998 --> 00:54:46.543
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don't die, so I don't die.


781
00:54:46.878 --> 00:54:49.505
She don't die, so I don't die.

782
00:54:49.672 --> 00:54:52.299
Louis, who's the girl?
What's her name?


783
00:54:52.717 --> 00:54:54.468
Who are you talking about?

784
00:54:55.053 --> 00:54:56.803
Was she at the Nite Owl?

785
00:54:57.388 --> 00:54:59.723
Louis, listen to me.
Was she at the Nite Owl?


786
00:55:07.065 --> 00:55:09.608
- This newspaper shit ain't shit.
- Where's the girl?


787
00:55:09.776 --> 00:55:11.276
Did you kill her?

788
00:55:11.444 --> 00:55:13.987
You wanted Louis to lose his cherry.
That wasn't enough.


789
00:55:14.155 --> 00:55:16.114
Things got out of hand.
You made her bleed.


790
00:55:16.282 --> 00:55:18.700
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.


791
00:55:18.868 --> 00:55:20.786
Who told you that?

792
00:55:21.079 --> 00:55:22.538
Now, listen to me.

793
00:55:22.747 --> 00:55:25.290
If that girl is alive,
she's the only chance you've got.


794
00:55:25.458 --> 00:55:28.794
- I think she's alive.
- You think? Then where is she now?


795
00:55:28.962 --> 00:55:31.964
Did you leave her someplace?
Sell her out?


796
00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:33.799
- Tell me where she is.
- Move.


797
00:55:35.885 --> 00:55:38.971
What are you doing, man? Don't.

798
00:55:40.098 --> 00:55:41.139
White.

799
00:55:42.308 --> 00:55:45.811
- One in six. Where's the girl?
- White, I have this under control.


800
00:55:45.979 --> 00:55:48.522
- Put the weapon down.
- Where is the girl?


801
00:55:53.945 --> 00:55:55.946
- Sylvester.
- What?


802
00:55:56.114 --> 00:55:59.741
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon ...

803
00:56:00.201 --> 00:56:03.787
brown corner house, upstairs.

804
00:56:15.174 --> 00:56:17.467
- Captain, just give me one minute.
- You got it.


805
00:56:23.641 --> 00:56:26.852
Nobody moves.
The rest of us are going in the front.


806
00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.396
Stay put until I give the word.

807
00:58:54.834 --> 00:58:56.626
He went around back, sir.

808
00:58:58.212 --> 00:59:00.714
Miss, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm sorry to ask you this.


809
00:59:00.882 --> 00:59:04.885
- I need to know what time they left you.
- Get her to the hospital. Excuse me.


810
00:59:05.386 --> 00:59:06.803
Give your career a rest.

811
00:59:07.305 --> 00:59:08.638
Leave her alone.

812
00:59:08.806 --> 00:59:11.475
A naked guy with a gun?
You expect anyone to believe that?


813
00:59:11.642 --> 00:59:13.894
Get the fuck away from me.

814
00:59:14.061 --> 00:59:16.938
- How's it gonna look in your report?
- It'll look like justice.


815
00:59:17.106 --> 00:59:19.524
That's what the man got. Justice.

816
00:59:19.692 --> 00:59:21.860
You don't know the meaning
of the word.


817
00:59:22.653 --> 00:59:25.947
Yeah? Well, you think it means
getting your picture in the paper.


818
00:59:26.157 --> 00:59:28.450
Go after criminals for a change,
instead of cops.


819
00:59:28.618 --> 00:59:30.786
Stensland got what he deserved
and so will you.


820
00:59:36.209 --> 00:59:37.459
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

821
00:59:40.713 --> 00:59:42.047
Take it easy. Come on, Bud.

822
00:59:43.049 --> 00:59:45.550
Come on. Let it go.

823
00:59:45.718 --> 00:59:47.719
It's best to stay away
when his blood is up.


824
00:59:47.887 --> 00:59:49.513
His blood's always up.

825
00:59:51.015 --> 00:59:53.058
You should
stay away from him altogether.


826
00:59:53.935 --> 00:59:57.312
Raymond Collins,
Ty Jones and Louis Fontaine.


827
00:59:57.522 --> 01:00:00.232
They are considered armed
and extremely dangerous.


828
01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:03.068
Repeat.
The Nite Owl suspects have escaped.


829
01:00:03.528 --> 01:00:05.403
How did they get out the window?

830
01:00:05.613 --> 01:00:07.489
They jumped from the second floor.

831
01:00:07.698 --> 01:00:10.116
Girl made her statement.
Jigs left her at midnight.


832
01:00:10.284 --> 01:00:11.910
Time to be at
the Nite Owl by 1.

833
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:16.373
The question was where did they
get their drugs. What was the answer?


834
01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.625
I haven't gotten that far yet.

835
01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:22.504
"Roland Navarette,
lives on Bunker Hill, runs a hole-up --"


836
01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:26.174
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

837
01:00:28.219 --> 01:00:31.930
- is something up, lieutenant?
- I need some backup. Come on.


838
01:00:49.156 --> 01:00:51.408
- What?
- Nothing. Let's go.


839
01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:01.334
This should be it.

840
01:01:05.923 --> 01:01:07.841
404.

841
01:01:28.654 --> 01:01:30.322
Nobody moves.

842
01:01:31.324 --> 01:01:33.909
- Stay right there. You're under arrest.
- Don't shoot.


843
01:01:34.076 --> 01:01:36.995
- Please don't shoot.
- Don't move. Don't move.


844
01:02:29.173 --> 01:02:32.300
There he is. You did good, kid.

845
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:35.762
You should've seen the place.
It was a nightmare. Blood everywhere.


846
01:02:36.347 --> 01:02:38.306
Who would have thought?
Shotgun Ed.


847
01:02:38.474 --> 01:02:41.351
- Shotgun Ed.
- Somebody get him cleaned up.


848
01:02:41.602 --> 01:02:43.228
Come on, kid.

849
01:02:45.856 --> 01:02:49.150
Edmund J. Exley
has amassed a brilliant record ...


850
01:02:49.318 --> 01:02:52.487
in his seven years
with the Los Angeles Police Department.


851
01:02:52.697 --> 01:02:55.824
Recently, he evinced spectacular bravery
in the line of duty.


852
01:02:56.033 --> 01:02:58.868
It is our privilege to present him
with our highest honor:


853
01:02:59.203 --> 01:03:00.912
The Medal of Valor.

854
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.415
- What kind of car was it?
- It was a Ford.


855
01:03:03.624 --> 01:03:06.418
My husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.


856
01:03:07.044 --> 01:03:09.838
Excuse me, ma'am.
Just the facts. Light or dark?


857
01:03:10.006 --> 01:03:13.800
Light. And that's really
all I remember, officer.


858
01:03:14.719 --> 01:03:16.720
Thank you, ma'am.
You've been a big help.


859
01:03:17.221 --> 01:03:18.930
Cut. That's a print.

860
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.142
- Hey, Big Jack.
- He's back.


861
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:25.937
Hey. Jack's back. Ha-ha.

862
01:03:57.511 --> 01:04:01.097
Tell Mr. Patchett that I have no intention
of changing my vote.


863
01:04:12.693 --> 01:04:17.530
It may surprise some that a man in office
would admit to making a mistake ...


864
01:04:18.365 --> 01:04:20.784
but after due consideration ...

865
01:04:21.368 --> 01:04:24.621
I am changing my position
on the matter before the council.


866
01:04:26.415 --> 01:04:29.751
"Go west, America,"
was the slogan of Manifest Destiny.


867
01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:33.755
Today is that last step westward
with no stop signs ...


868
01:04:33.923 --> 01:04:37.926
no traffic signals,
from downtown to the beach in 20 minutes.


869
01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:11.334
What were you gonna start with?

870
01:05:13.587 --> 01:05:15.088
Prostitution?

871
01:05:16.841 --> 01:05:18.174
Gambling?

872
01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:25.682
Go back to Jersey, sonny.
This is the City of the Angels ...


873
01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:28.017
and you haven't got any wings.

874
01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:53.209
Nice to see you again.
Take care.


875
01:06:30.539 --> 01:06:33.750
I wondered when you might
knock on my door again, Officer White.


876
01:06:34.418 --> 01:06:35.752
It's Bud.

877
01:06:37.171 --> 01:06:38.338
Bud.

878
01:07:07.701 --> 01:07:08.785
Why me?

879
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:12.121
I don't know.

880
01:07:48.742 --> 01:07:49.993
This election ...

881
01:07:50.202 --> 01:07:53.496
is about the future
of law enforcement in Los Angeles.


882
01:07:53.664 --> 01:07:56.708
City Councilman Rogers
represents that future.


883
01:07:57.084 --> 01:07:58.793
So let's dig deep ...

884
01:07:58.961 --> 01:08:02.797
and let's get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew would like a few words.


885
01:08:06.218 --> 01:08:09.971
Thank you. Thank you, Brett Chase,
the very talented star of "Badge of Honor".


886
01:08:12.266 --> 01:08:16.436
Let me tell you, I am so thrilled to be here
on the set of "Badge of Honor".


887
01:08:16.603 --> 01:08:18.855
Big V. Jackie.

888
01:08:20.107 --> 01:08:21.816
Good to see you back.

889
01:08:22.026 --> 01:08:24.777
- How they hanging, Sid?
- Down around my ankles.


890
01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:28.031
- You tight with the DA, Jackie?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.


891
01:08:28.198 --> 01:08:30.658
He tried to throw me off the force
last Christmas.


892
01:08:30.826 --> 01:08:32.535
How about some payback, big-time-?

893
01:08:32.703 --> 01:08:36.914
Plus the usual $50 donation
to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.


894
01:08:37.082 --> 01:08:41.044
- Did you know the DA was a swish?
- No kidding.


895
01:08:41.587 --> 01:08:43.212
Uh ...

896
01:08:43.589 --> 01:08:46.758
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?


897
01:08:46.925 --> 01:08:49.594
- He just got off the honor farm.
- What's he doing here?


898
01:08:50.471 --> 01:08:53.056
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.


899
01:08:53.223 --> 01:08:55.516
I'm getting him
to fuck the DA for 100 bucks.


900
01:08:55.684 --> 01:08:58.728
That's twice the 50
you got for wrecking his career.


901
01:08:59.438 --> 01:09:02.982
- Hey, Matt. Come here, come here.
- Jesus, don't bring him --


902
01:09:07.905 --> 01:09:09.572
That's DA Loew right there.

903
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:13.493
Yeah.

904
01:09:14.828 --> 01:09:16.120
You need a drink, kid?

905
01:09:16.997 --> 01:09:20.291
- Yeah.
- Jack, look after him a minute.


906
01:09:20.459 --> 01:09:24.420
Matt, this is Jack.
No secrets between me and him.


907
01:09:29.676 --> 01:09:32.095
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm okay. How are you?


908
01:09:32.262 --> 01:09:34.514
I'm good. Yeah.

909
01:09:36.517 --> 01:09:38.351
Have we, uh, met before?

910
01:09:40.687 --> 01:09:41.938
Yeah.

911
01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:46.442
- Was it at a party?
- Well, it was something like that.


912
01:09:48.028 --> 01:09:49.654
Fleur-de
-Lis party, right?

913
01:09:50.948 --> 01:09:52.115
Right.

914
01:09:52.783 --> 01:09:54.283
Fleur-de
-Lis.

915
01:09:54.868 --> 01:09:56.869
"Whatever you desire."

916
01:09:57.121 --> 01:09:59.789
Dope, hookers that
look like movie stars ...


917
01:10:00.207 --> 01:10:02.875
-Pierce Patchett has it all.
-Ha-ha-ha.


918
01:10:03.043 --> 01:10:04.919
Boy, you could say that again.

919
01:10:05.129 --> 01:10:10.716
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.
I mean, I dig him, but ...


920
01:10:12.219 --> 01:10:15.805
you know, he, um, scares me too.

921
01:10:16.557 --> 01:10:19.142
Really? How?

922
01:10:20.227 --> 01:10:25.189
When I came out to L.A., this isn't
exactly where I saw myself ending up.


923
01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:29.152
Yeah, well, get in line.

924
01:10:29.653 --> 01:10:31.737
That's courage, kid. Drink up.

925
01:10:36.034 --> 01:10:38.703
You know, I don't
think I should do this.

926
01:10:39.246 --> 01:10:40.955
It's not like you don't know how.

927
01:10:41.123 --> 01:10:43.958
And Jack here's got connections
with "Badge of Honor".


928
01:10:44.126 --> 01:10:46.210
You pull this off,
there'll be a part for you.


929
01:10:46.378 --> 01:10:49.380
I smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?

930
01:10:52.009 --> 01:10:56.095
Go on. The DA's free.
Go introduce yourself. Go on.


931
01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:59.182
Talk to him, Jack.
Tell him about the opening on the show.


932
01:10:59.349 --> 01:11:02.602
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty sure I can get you
a part on this show.


933
01:11:02.853 --> 01:11:04.812
But, uh, that's later on.

934
01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:09.484
You know, tonight, just go on over there
and pretend it's an acting job.


935
01:11:09.651 --> 01:11:12.612
- Like show biz.
- Acting, that's it.


936
01:11:12.779 --> 01:11:13.863
- Right.
- Yeah.


937
01:11:14.031 --> 01:11:16.741
- No one's gonna know about this, right?
- No.


938
01:11:18.952 --> 01:11:20.620
It'll be our secret.

939
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:25.208
Okay. All right.

940
01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:27.835
- Show biz.
- That's it. Go on.


941
01:11:31.298 --> 01:11:34.592
Show biz. Man.

942
01:11:34.968 --> 01:11:37.428
If Reynolds works his charms,
which I know he will ...


943
01:11:37.596 --> 01:11:40.389
they'll be at the
Hollywood Center Motel, Room 203.


944
01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:42.683
Meet me there at midnight
for a photo shoot.


945
01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:46.979
Maybe we can work in
the Hollywood sign this time.


946
01:11:48.482 --> 01:11:50.983
What do you know
about Pierce Patchett?


947
01:11:51.652 --> 01:11:54.320
Patchett? I know what you know.
He's very rich.


948
01:11:54.488 --> 01:11:57.740
Just invested in freeway construction,
which is gonna make him richer.


949
01:11:58.075 --> 01:11:59.158
Why do you ask?

950
01:11:59.326 --> 01:12:01.452
I just keep hearing rumors, you know.

951
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.872
High-class porn, drugs,
hookers that look like movie stars.


952
01:12:05.332 --> 01:12:09.835
Ha. Patchett's what I call twilight.
He ain't queer and he ain't red.


953
01:12:10.003 --> 01:12:13.714
He cannot help me
in my quest for prime "sinnuendo."


954
01:12:19.137 --> 01:12:23.307
As though "Badge of Honor" would
touch that guy with a 10-foot pole ...


955
01:12:23.475 --> 01:12:26.602
after he's been Hush-Hush
cover boy twice in one year.


956
01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:28.062
See you in a few hours, Sid.

957
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:32.316
Yeah, midnight. I guarantee
all kinds of illegal activity.


958
01:13:05.517 --> 01:13:07.518
- Another, Jack?
- Yeah.


959
01:13:52.064 --> 01:13:53.648
Kid?

960
01:13:59.363 --> 01:14:00.529
Matt?

961
01:14:01.073 --> 01:14:04.283
Come on, kid, you don't
have to do the --

962
01:14:35.565 --> 01:14:37.483
Thank you for what
you did for me ...

963
01:14:37.984 --> 01:14:40.611
for killing those animals
who raped me.


964
01:14:40.946 --> 01:14:43.656
Will you thank Officer White
for me, please?


965
01:14:43.949 --> 01:14:44.990
Sure.

966
01:14:46.702 --> 01:14:50.454
Seeing him come through the door
is about the only thing I remember.


967
01:14:50.664 --> 01:14:51.831
Thank God.

968
01:14:53.083 --> 01:14:55.626
You remember what time
the Negroes left you, right?


969
01:14:55.961 --> 01:14:59.130
In your statement, you said
they left you at midnight.


970
01:14:59.339 --> 01:15:00.464
They might have.

971
01:15:06.012 --> 01:15:09.432
- What do you mean, they might have?
- I don't know what time they left me.


972
01:15:09.599 --> 01:15:11.308
I wanted them dead.

973
01:15:11.643 --> 01:15:15.146
Would anyone care that they
raped a Mexican girl ...


974
01:15:15.313 --> 01:15:18.357
if they hadn't killed
those white people at the Nite Owl?


975
01:15:19.317 --> 01:15:21.610
I did what I
had to do for justice.

976
01:15:21.778 --> 01:15:25.156
Inez? Exley, over here. Smile, Inez.

977
01:15:26.074 --> 01:15:28.492
So is he your hero, Miss Soto?

978
01:15:29.202 --> 01:15:33.664
Fellas, how about this? "Rape Victim
Wheeled out of Hospital by Nite Owl Hero."


979
01:15:36.001 --> 01:15:37.501
Hey.

980
01:15:39.337 --> 01:15:41.547
All they get is Veronica Lake.

981
01:15:43.717 --> 01:15:46.051
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.

982
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:58.272
Bisbee?

983
01:15:59.232 --> 01:16:00.357
Mm-hm.

984
01:16:00.525 --> 01:16:02.067
I grew up there.

985
01:16:04.196 --> 01:16:08.699
I'm going back in a couple of years,
open up a dress shop.


986
01:16:10.702 --> 01:16:13.579
The girls in Bisbee
need a little glamour.


987
01:16:19.419 --> 01:16:21.796
Where'd this come from?

988
01:16:22.756 --> 01:16:26.801
When I was 12, my old man went after
my mother with a bottle. I got in the way.


989
01:16:28.762 --> 01:16:30.387
So you saved her.

990
01:16:31.765 --> 01:16:33.182
Not for long.

991
01:16:36.228 --> 01:16:39.522
- I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
- He tied me to the radiator.


992
01:16:40.273 --> 01:16:43.442
I watched him beat my mother to death
with a tire iron ...


993
01:16:45.904 --> 01:16:48.072
and he left me there.

994
01:16:50.158 --> 01:16:52.952
Three days before
a truant officer found us.


995
01:16:56.081 --> 01:16:57.957
They never found the old man.

996
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.301
Is that why you became a cop?

997
01:17:10.095 --> 01:17:11.470
To get even?

998
01:17:12.931 --> 01:17:14.265
Maybe.

999
01:17:16.142 --> 01:17:18.143
Do you like it?

1000
01:17:21.106 --> 01:17:22.898
I used to.

1001
01:17:24.442 --> 01:17:27.152
Now it's all strong-arm,
sitting-duck stuff.


1002
01:17:28.154 --> 01:17:29.488
I mean, if I could ...

1003
01:17:30.782 --> 01:17:33.284
If I could get a chance
to work Homicide ...


1004
01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:36.495
like a real detective ...

1005
01:17:36.955 --> 01:17:39.498
That prick Exley,
he shot the wrong guys.


1006
01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:45.087
Whoever killed Stensland's still around.
I know it in here. I know it.


1007
01:17:45.547 --> 01:17:47.464
There's something wrong
with the Nite Owl.


1008
01:17:47.799 --> 01:17:49.967
I just can't prove it, that's all.

1009
01:17:51.177 --> 01:17:53.137
I'm not smart enough.

1010
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:58.309
I'm just the guy they bring in
to scare the other guy shitless.


1011
01:18:01.688 --> 01:18:03.147
You're wrong.

1012
01:18:03.982 --> 01:18:06.525
You found Patchett. You found me.

1013
01:18:06.902 --> 01:18:08.694
You're smart enough.

1014
01:18:20.373 --> 01:18:23.959
Bud White. What brings you down
to the basement?


1015
01:18:27.213 --> 01:18:29.256
I got a couple of Nite Owl questions.

1016
01:18:29.424 --> 01:18:32.509
Don't know if you read the papers,
but that case is closed.


1017
01:18:34.512 --> 01:18:36.347
Anything bother you about it, Ray?

1018
01:18:37.057 --> 01:18:40.726
The fact that the pack-up boys haven't
hauled this shit out of here yet.


1019
01:18:45.523 --> 01:18:47.733
We got three shotguns
taken from the suspects ...


1020
01:18:47.901 --> 01:18:50.527
which match the strike marks
on the shell casings.


1021
01:18:50.695 --> 01:18:52.363
What more do you want?

1022
01:19:04.084 --> 01:19:05.918
There's blood on the wall here.

1023
01:19:06.586 --> 01:19:09.046
I thought everyone got shot
in the men's room.


1024
01:19:09.255 --> 01:19:11.715
That is Stensland's blood.

1025
01:19:12.258 --> 01:19:13.759
Stensland?

1026
01:19:13.927 --> 01:19:17.680
Blow to the head. Probably unconscious
when they dragged him in the john.


1027
01:19:19.391 --> 01:19:20.641
Did they hit anyone else?

1028
01:19:20.809 --> 01:19:24.228
No, but he was a cop.
He probably tried to do something.


1029
01:19:28.108 --> 01:19:31.694
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone sitting next to him.


1030
01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.408
Two of the victims were women?

1031
01:19:37.575 --> 01:19:41.704
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift
waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.


1032
01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:48.085
Susan Lefferts.

1033
01:19:49.921 --> 01:19:51.922
Yeah, what about her?

1034
01:19:54.384 --> 01:19:55.759
You're welcome.

1035
01:19:58.054 --> 01:20:00.139
Mrs. Lefferts.

1036
01:20:01.766 --> 01:20:05.728
Mrs. Lefferts?
I'm Officer White, L.A.P.D.


1037
01:20:07.981 --> 01:20:11.442
Tell me about the boyfriend. The one
you mentioned at the coroner's office.


1038
01:20:11.651 --> 01:20:14.028
I told you I didn't
approve of that boyfriend.


1039
01:20:14.612 --> 01:20:18.991
He was too old for you.
And you let him be fresh with me.


1040
01:20:20.785 --> 01:20:23.245
They came here one day
when I wasn't home.


1041
01:20:23.621 --> 01:20:25.539
Mrs. Jensen next door said ...

1042
01:20:25.707 --> 01:20:28.751
she thought she saw Susie's boyfriend
and another man ...


1043
01:20:28.918 --> 01:20:31.295
and she heard a ruckus.

1044
01:20:32.172 --> 01:20:36.008
- What was the boyfriend's name?
- We weren't properly introduced.


1045
01:20:36.634 --> 01:20:38.969
Susie gave him a nickname,
"Muns" or "Luns."


1046
01:20:39.137 --> 01:20:41.722
Stens? Was it Stens?

1047
01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:46.477
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Look at a picture for me.


1048
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:51.815
That's him. That's him.

1049
01:20:57.197 --> 01:20:59.364
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.

1050
01:21:00.158 --> 01:21:02.201
Was it outside? inside?

1051
01:21:03.495 --> 01:21:04.661
Outside.

1052
01:21:04.829 --> 01:21:08.916
And then Mrs. Jensen said
they kept going under the house.


1053
01:21:13.004 --> 01:21:15.339
You have to leave now, officer.

1054
01:21:16.549 --> 01:21:20.010
- What's through here?
- Just a room full of old things.


1055
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.179
Don't move that.

1056
01:21:23.556 --> 01:21:24.598
Phew.

1057
01:21:24.766 --> 01:21:28.227
Don't mind the smell.
I think a rat died behind the wall.


1058
01:21:29.521 --> 01:21:31.688
My Susie was a good girl.

1059
01:21:31.856 --> 01:21:34.858
She was never
in any kind of trouble at all.


1060
01:21:37.987 --> 01:21:39.029
Phew.

1061
01:22:46.097 --> 01:22:48.557
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.


1062
01:22:48.766 --> 01:22:50.309
They call me Buzz.

1063
01:22:57.525 --> 01:22:58.609
Was it a rat?

1064
01:22:59.485 --> 01:23:01.320
Yeah, a great big one.

1065
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:07.576
Here. Compliments of the
Los Angeles Police Department.


1066
01:23:24.802 --> 01:23:27.763
Stomach of the week
from a motel homicide.


1067
01:23:27.972 --> 01:23:31.391
Unemployed actor had frankfurter,
french fries, alcohol and sperm.


1068
01:23:31.559 --> 01:23:34.019
Hell of a last supper,
don't you think, lieutenant?


1069
01:23:34.187 --> 01:23:36.813
Anything bothering you
about the, uh, Nite Owl case?


1070
01:23:36.981 --> 01:23:39.650
Yeah, the fact that you guys
won't let it get filed away.


1071
01:23:40.818 --> 01:23:44.488
- What do you mean?
- Bud White grilled me on it this morning.


1072
01:23:45.531 --> 01:23:49.493
- Bud White?
- You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.


1073
01:23:51.704 --> 01:23:54.498
Did he say where he was going
after he talked to you?


1074
01:24:06.886 --> 01:24:08.720
Let my daughter rest in peace.

1075
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:11.139
Mrs. Lefferts,
I just wanna ask a few questions.


1076
01:24:11.307 --> 01:24:13.684
Officer White already checked
under the house.


1077
01:24:14.269 --> 01:24:15.352
Under the house?

1078
01:24:16.104 --> 01:24:18.438
- Where?
- Out back.


1079
01:24:19.857 --> 01:24:21.525
All he found was rodents.

1080
01:24:24.862 --> 01:24:28.782
I need an ID on this as soon as possible.
You talk only to me on this one.


1081
01:24:31.869 --> 01:24:33.829
Vincennes, I need your help
with something.


1082
01:24:33.997 --> 01:24:38.041
I'm busy right now. Why don't you
just go ask some of your boys in Homicide?


1083
01:24:40.295 --> 01:24:42.963
I can't. I need someone
outside of Homicide.


1084
01:24:43.589 --> 01:24:46.508
I want you to tail Bud White
till he goes on duty this evening.


1085
01:24:47.969 --> 01:24:50.220
Do me a real favor
and leave me alone.


1086
01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:53.682
Do you make the Negroes
for the Nite Owl killings?


1087
01:24:56.978 --> 01:24:59.563
- What?
- It's a simple question.


1088
01:25:01.649 --> 01:25:04.568
Why in the world
do you wanna go digging any deeper ...


1089
01:25:04.736 --> 01:25:08.196
into the Nite Owl killings, lieutenant?

1090
01:25:12.035 --> 01:25:13.744
Rollo Tomasi.

1091
01:25:15.496 --> 01:25:18.582
Is there more to that,
or am I supposed to guess?


1092
01:25:20.668 --> 01:25:22.836
Rollo was a purse snatcher.

1093
01:25:27.258 --> 01:25:29.343
My father ran into him off-duty ...

1094
01:25:31.346 --> 01:25:34.431
and he shot my father six times
and got away clean.


1095
01:25:35.933 --> 01:25:37.684
No one even knew who he was.

1096
01:25:38.519 --> 01:25:40.604
I made the name up
to give him personality.


1097
01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.565
What's your point?

1098
01:25:44.192 --> 01:25:46.943
Rollo Tomasi's the reason
I became a cop.


1099
01:25:47.695 --> 01:25:51.239
I wanted to catch the guys
who thought they could get away with it.


1100
01:25:52.658 --> 01:25:54.451
It was supposed to be about justice.

1101
01:25:55.453 --> 01:25:58.455
Then somewhere along the way,
I lost sight of that.


1102
01:26:02.627 --> 01:26:03.877
Why'd you become a cop?

1103
01:26:09.634 --> 01:26:11.134
Huh.

1104
01:26:14.639 --> 01:26:16.681
I don't remember.

1105
01:26:22.897 --> 01:26:26.608
- What do you want, Exley?
- I just wanna solve this thing.


1106
01:26:27.151 --> 01:26:30.487
- Nite Owl was solved.
- No.


1107
01:26:31.739 --> 01:26:33.073
I wanna do it right.

1108
01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:36.159
Even if it means
paying the consequences?


1109
01:26:36.702 --> 01:26:37.744
Mm-hm.

1110
01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.665
All right, college boy, I'll help ...

1111
01:26:41.833 --> 01:26:44.668
but there's a case your boys
in Homicide don't care about.


1112
01:26:44.836 --> 01:26:49.631
They think it's just another
Hollywood "homo-cide," but I don't.


1113
01:26:49.799 --> 01:26:52.926
You help me with mine,
I'll help you with yours.


1114
01:26:53.344 --> 01:26:56.179
- Deal?
- Deal.


1115
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:30.755
Johnny Stompanato.

1116
01:27:31.924 --> 01:27:34.801
Officer Wendell White.
How's tricks, paisano?


1117
01:27:35.011 --> 01:27:36.678
I ain't your paisano.

1118
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:39.556
I ain't in the snitch business anymore.

1119
01:27:39.724 --> 01:27:42.017
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?

1120
01:27:43.102 --> 01:27:44.936
Works for Pierce Patchett.

1121
01:27:45.521 --> 01:27:46.688
Should I?

1122
01:27:48.107 --> 01:27:50.984
You're muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.


1123
01:27:51.194 --> 01:27:52.527
You tell me.

1124
01:27:53.571 --> 01:27:55.947
Oh, yeah. Yeah, 
I remember now.

1125
01:27:56.115 --> 01:28:00.243
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.
Same as you're gonna be someday.


1126
01:28:00.453 --> 01:28:01.912
And that's all you're gonna get.

1127
01:28:02.788 --> 01:28:04.623
And you can keep your 20 bucks.

1128
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:13.548
What do I get if I give you your
balls back, you wop cocksucker?


1129
01:28:14.509 --> 01:28:17.719
Okay. Okay.

1130
01:28:17.887 --> 01:28:20.263
There was a rumor going around ...

1131
01:28:20.473 --> 01:28:23.600
that Meeks had a line
on a large supply of H.


1132
01:28:25.645 --> 01:28:30.607
- And?
- And nothing. He skipped out.


1133
01:28:42.995 --> 01:28:44.162
Bullshit.

1134
01:28:45.122 --> 01:28:48.291
How would Meeks get his hands
on a large supply of heroin?


1135
01:28:49.126 --> 01:28:52.462
You're right.
It's probably bullshit.


1136
01:28:52.672 --> 01:28:55.173
Even if he did,
he could never unload it.


1137
01:28:55.466 --> 01:28:57.968
Not without drawing
all kinds of attention.


1138
01:28:58.511 --> 01:29:02.514
Maybe that's why he's under a house in
Elysian Park and he don't smell too good ...


1139
01:29:04.016 --> 01:29:05.350
paisano.

1140
01:29:57.778 --> 01:30:00.322
Maybe White's
not so dumb after all.


1141
01:30:13.544 --> 01:30:17.547
We got Rita Hayworth at the morgue,
and now Veronica Lake with White.


1142
01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:22.427
I think your case and my case
are connected. It's Fleur-de-Lis again.


1143
01:30:22.595 --> 01:30:23.762
Fleur-de
-Lis?

1144
01:30:24.096 --> 01:30:26.389
Yeah. "Whatever you desire."

1145
01:30:26.599 --> 01:30:27.724
Porno.

1146
01:30:28.059 --> 01:30:30.894
High-class whores
cut to look like movie stars.


1147
01:30:31.103 --> 01:30:34.731
Who knows what else. Reynolds,
the kid that got killed, was involved.


1148
01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:36.566
So is Pierce Patchett.

1149
01:30:36.776 --> 01:30:38.068
The millionaire?

1150
01:30:38.569 --> 01:30:40.570
Yeah, I think we
should go talk to him.

1151
01:30:41.405 --> 01:30:43.406
First I wanna brace Stompanato.

1152
01:30:59.674 --> 01:31:02.133
Want an autograph?
Write to MGM.


1153
01:31:02.968 --> 01:31:06.262
Since when do two-bit hoods
and hookers give out autographs?


1154
01:31:06.639 --> 01:31:09.224
- What did you say to me?
- L.A.P.D. Sit down.


1155
01:31:09.433 --> 01:31:11.059
Who the hell do you think you are?

1156
01:31:11.227 --> 01:31:13.937
Take a walk, honey,
before I haul your ass downtown.


1157
01:31:14.105 --> 01:31:16.898
- You are making a large mistake.
- Get away from our table.


1158
01:31:17.108 --> 01:31:18.441
Shut up.

1159
01:31:19.527 --> 01:31:21.861
A hooker cut to look like Turner
is still a hooker.


1160
01:31:22.029 --> 01:31:24.406
- Hey!
- She just looks like Lana Turner.


1161
01:31:24.573 --> 01:31:27.117
- She is Lana Turner.
- What?


1162
01:31:27.284 --> 01:31:29.369
She is Lana Turner.

1163
01:31:38.003 --> 01:31:39.838
How was I supposed to know?

1164
01:31:56.188 --> 01:31:59.983
I believe the Nite Owl's
your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.


1165
01:32:00.151 --> 01:32:02.694
I saw you on television
getting your medal.


1166
01:32:04.196 --> 01:32:05.488
And you're ...

1167
01:32:05.865 --> 01:32:09.701
that other Hollywood
celebrity policeman, aren't you?


1168
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:14.664
The Veronica Lake look-alike works
for you. She's one of your whores, correct?


1169
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.169
- A vulgar term.
- Why's she seeing Bud White?


1170
01:32:19.336 --> 01:32:23.173
Why do men and women
usually see each other, Mr. Exley?


1171
01:32:26.051 --> 01:32:28.762
Let's try this on for size:
Fleur-de-Lis.


1172
01:32:29.221 --> 01:32:31.014
"Whatever you desire."

1173
01:32:31.682 --> 01:32:34.642
An actor named Matt Reynolds.

1174
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.646
No? Nothing?

1175
01:32:39.231 --> 01:32:42.358
- No?
- We want some answers, Patchett.


1176
01:32:45.029 --> 01:32:46.905
We all want something.

1177
01:32:48.532 --> 01:32:51.201
- Lieutenant Exley, come in.
- Guy's as cool as they come.


1178
01:32:53.746 --> 01:32:56.581
Lieutenant Exley,
come in, please. Over.


1179
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:58.792
This is Exley.

1180
01:32:58.959 --> 01:33:01.711
The coroner wants to talk to you.
He says he has your ID.


1181
01:33:02.254 --> 01:33:04.839
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes
is coming in to talk to him.


1182
01:33:05.007 --> 01:33:06.883
- Roger.
- I'll drop you at your car.


1183
01:33:07.051 --> 01:33:09.260
- Where the hell are you going?
- Lynn Bracken's.


1184
01:33:09.553 --> 01:33:13.056
I'm gonna find out why Patchett
has her seeing Bud White.


1185
01:33:13.224 --> 01:33:14.891
See you at the Frolic Room.

1186
01:33:15.059 --> 01:33:18.311
Oh, great. You get the girl,
I get the coroner.


1187
01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.324
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the q.t.


1188
01:33:34.161 --> 01:33:37.664
Hey, I was just coming up to see you.
You get that ID?


1189
01:33:37.832 --> 01:33:42.252
Thank God for dental records.
Stiff used to be a cop. Leland Meeks.


1190
01:33:42.419 --> 01:33:43.586
Buzz Meeks?

1191
01:33:43.754 --> 01:33:44.921
- You knew him?
- Of him.


1192
01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:48.716
He was around when I joined the force.
Bad rep. Thanks.


1193
01:33:48.884 --> 01:33:52.762
Hey. "Just the facts," Jack.
"Just the facts."


1194
01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.225
Anything else, sergeant?

1195
01:33:57.434 --> 01:34:00.603
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39 -'41.
I need to see his arrest records.


1196
01:34:00.771 --> 01:34:02.939
Okay.

1197
01:34:08.487 --> 01:34:11.114
Miss Bracken,
I'm Lieutenant Exley.


1198
01:34:11.323 --> 01:34:15.076
I know who you are.
Bud told me all about you.


1199
01:34:15.244 --> 01:34:17.120
Is that so?

1200
01:34:17.413 --> 01:34:20.123
And what did White have to say?

1201
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.959
He said you were smart.

1202
01:34:23.627 --> 01:34:27.463
He also said you were a coward, and that
you'd screw yourself to get ahead.


1203
01:34:28.132 --> 01:34:30.633
Well, let's concentrate on my smarts.

1204
01:34:30.801 --> 01:34:35.638
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.


1205
01:34:36.807 --> 01:34:38.641
I am very impressed
with the results ...


1206
01:34:39.977 --> 01:34:41.436
but I need answers.

1207
01:34:41.604 --> 01:34:44.647
And if I don't get them,
I'm gonna take you and Patchett down.


1208
01:34:45.316 --> 01:34:47.984
Pierce Patchett
can take care of himself.


1209
01:34:49.028 --> 01:34:50.987
And I'm not afraid of you.

1210
01:34:51.864 --> 01:34:54.532
And you forget one thing, lieutenant ...

1211
01:34:54.867 --> 01:34:57.493
Pierce also taught me how to fuck.

1212
01:35:01.206 --> 01:35:05.501
And he tells you who to fuck.
Why does he have you fucking Bud White?


1213
01:35:05.711 --> 01:35:08.379
What makes you think I'm not seeing Bud
because I want to?


1214
01:35:10.549 --> 01:35:13.885
It would be easier for you
if there was an angle, wouldn't it?


1215
01:35:14.678 --> 01:35:17.764
You're afraid of Bud because you can't
figure out how to play him.


1216
01:35:18.849 --> 01:35:22.060
He doesn't follow
the same rules of politics as you do.


1217
01:35:22.853 --> 01:35:24.646
It makes him dangerous.

1218
01:35:24.855 --> 01:35:27.523
- I can handle Bud White.
- Can you?


1219
01:35:31.528 --> 01:35:33.738
I see Bud because I want to.

1220
01:35:37.242 --> 01:35:40.578
I see Bud because
he can't hide the good inside of him.


1221
01:35:42.414 --> 01:35:45.166
I see Bud because he makes me feel
like Lynn Bracken ...


1222
01:35:45.376 --> 01:35:48.753
and not some Veronica Lake look-alike
who fucks for money.


1223
01:35:50.923 --> 01:35:55.218
I see Bud because he doesn't
know how to disguise who he is.


1224
01:35:57.262 --> 01:36:00.890
I see Bud for all the ways
he's different from you.


1225
01:36:03.268 --> 01:36:05.561
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.

1226
01:36:05.896 --> 01:36:08.898
The way you've underestimated Bud White?

1227
01:36:15.406 --> 01:36:18.074
Fucking me and fucking Bud
aren't the same thing, you know.


1228
01:36:18.575 --> 01:36:20.576
Stop talking about Bud White.

1229
01:36:45.477 --> 01:36:47.437
Come on.

1230
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:51.441
Shit.

1231
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:06.497
Jack Vincennes.

1232
01:37:07.499 --> 01:37:09.250
It's going on midnight, Jack.

1233
01:37:09.418 --> 01:37:11.335
I need two minutes, Dudley.

1234
01:37:11.670 --> 01:37:12.879
It's important.

1235
01:37:13.505 --> 01:37:17.800
Good thing for you my wife and daughters
are at the beach in Santa Barbara.


1236
01:37:20.929 --> 01:37:26.100
- Do you remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
- A disgrace as a police officer.


1237
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:30.480
Straight D fitness reports from every
CO he ever served under. What about him?


1238
01:37:31.190 --> 01:37:34.108
Twelve years ago, he was on a Vice roust
with Dick Stensland.


1239
01:37:34.318 --> 01:37:37.612
They questioned Pierce Patchett
about a blackmail scam.


1240
01:37:37.821 --> 01:37:41.991
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing
prominent businessmen with hookers.


1241
01:37:42.701 --> 01:37:45.661
Anyway, charges were dropped.
Insufficient evidence.


1242
01:37:45.871 --> 01:37:47.997
You were the supervising officer
on that case.


1243
01:37:48.165 --> 01:37:50.416
I was wondering if you
remember anything about it.


1244
01:37:51.668 --> 01:37:53.169
What's this all about, boyo?

1245
01:37:54.129 --> 01:37:57.673
Part of it has to do with a murder.
I've been working with Ed Exley on it.


1246
01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:00.676
You're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.

1247
01:38:00.886 --> 01:38:03.096
Since when do you work
with Edmund Exley?


1248
01:38:04.223 --> 01:38:06.682
It's a private investigation.

1249
01:38:07.184 --> 01:38:08.434
Ah.

1250
01:38:08.685 --> 01:38:11.187
I messed something up.
I'm trying to make amends.


1251
01:38:11.355 --> 01:38:13.731
Don't start trying
to do the right thing, boyo.


1252
01:38:14.233 --> 01:38:16.526
You haven't had the practice.

1253
01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:27.328
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland. Hmm.

1254
01:38:28.872 --> 01:38:32.125
So, what does Exley make of this?

1255
01:38:32.292 --> 01:38:35.378
I haven't told him yet.
I just came from the records room.


1256
01:39:01.071 --> 01:39:03.364
Have you a valediction, boyo?

1257
01:39:09.621 --> 01:39:11.247
Rollo ...

1258
01:39:12.291 --> 01:39:13.958
Tomasi.

1259
01:39:34.813 --> 01:39:38.399
Sergeant Vincennes was killed
by a .32 slug to the heart.


1260
01:39:38.609 --> 01:39:40.985
Time of death, approximately 1 a.m.

1261
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:46.157
Although he was found in Echo Park,
forensics indicates the body was moved.


1262
01:39:47.784 --> 01:39:51.245
I want two-man teams
to scour that entire neighborhood.


1263
01:39:52.122 --> 01:39:56.334
Our justice must be swift
and merciless.


1264
01:39:58.503 --> 01:39:59.545
That is all.

1265
01:40:08.096 --> 01:40:10.973
Edmund, might I have a word with you?

1266
01:40:14.478 --> 01:40:17.480
We're trying to run down a lead
on an associate of Vincennes.


1267
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:20.524
The records check has
led to a dead end.

1268
01:40:20.817 --> 01:40:22.026
What's the name?

1269
01:40:22.319 --> 01:40:24.070
Rollo Tomasi.

1270
01:40:25.822 --> 01:40:27.823
You ever heard Vincennes mention him?

1271
01:40:30.661 --> 01:40:32.370
No. No, I haven't.

1272
01:40:35.874 --> 01:40:36.874
Well ...

1273
01:40:37.042 --> 01:40:39.043
It's probably nothing. Still ...

1274
01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:42.880
keep your eyes open, eh, boyo?

1275
01:40:52.557 --> 01:40:55.184
I know it's unlikely, but suppose,
just for a moment ...


1276
01:40:55.394 --> 01:40:58.813
somebody did have that much heroin,
who would they go to to move it?


1277
01:40:59.356 --> 01:41:04.235
- White, in my office.
- Captain. Look, just give me a name.


1278
01:41:05.028 --> 01:41:06.404
Mickey Cohen.

1279
01:41:12.369 --> 01:41:13.369
Captain?

1280
01:41:13.537 --> 01:41:16.205
I could use your fearsome habits
at the Victory Motel.


1281
01:41:17.541 --> 01:41:18.791
Uh, when?

1282
01:41:20.043 --> 01:41:21.127
Now, Wendell.

1283
01:41:22.212 --> 01:41:23.421
Right.

1284
01:41:23.588 --> 01:41:25.089
Close the door, lad.

1285
01:41:32.597 --> 01:41:35.433
You're a bit of a puzzlement to me
these days, Wendell.


1286
01:41:35.809 --> 01:41:38.060
You don't seem to be
your old cruel self anymore.


1287
01:41:38.729 --> 01:41:41.689
And I had such
grand plans for your future.


1288
01:41:41.898 --> 01:41:43.107
What plans?

1289
01:41:44.568 --> 01:41:48.571
You have your extracurricular activities
and I have mine.


1290
01:41:51.616 --> 01:41:54.702
We must have a clarification session
one of these days.


1291
01:41:55.787 --> 01:41:58.914
However, right now ...

1292
01:41:59.416 --> 01:42:02.626
we're gonna brace a man
who may know who killed Jack Vincennes.


1293
01:42:02.961 --> 01:42:04.754
So the question is ...

1294
01:42:05.088 --> 01:42:06.589
can I count on you, lad?

1295
01:42:06.757 --> 01:42:08.674
- Yes or no?
- Yes, sir.


1296
01:42:13.764 --> 01:42:17.475
I wanna know everything you
and Jack Vincennes talked about last night.


1297
01:42:17.768 --> 01:42:19.769
Start with the ID on the corpse.

1298
01:42:19.978 --> 01:42:23.272
An ex-cop.
Leland "Buzz" Meeks.


1299
01:42:23.482 --> 01:42:24.815
An ex-cop?

1300
01:42:25.275 --> 01:42:26.901
What did Jack say?
Did he know him?


1301
01:42:27.444 --> 01:42:29.528
Only by reputation.

1302
01:42:35.702 --> 01:42:37.912
Wendell, this is Sid Hudgens.

1303
01:42:38.121 --> 01:42:40.748
I'm willing to cooperate.
There's no need to tie me down.


1304
01:42:40.957 --> 01:42:42.666
It's for your own safety.

1305
01:42:43.668 --> 01:42:47.171
Now, what can you tell us
about Sergeant Jack Vincennes?


1306
01:42:47.339 --> 01:42:49.340
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?

1307
01:42:49.633 --> 01:42:52.593
I can tell you he's on
the night train to the big adiÃ³s.


1308
01:42:56.765 --> 01:43:00.351
I didn't have anything to do with him
getting killed, if that's what you mean.


1309
01:43:00.644 --> 01:43:04.563
- But you were business associates.
- What's that got to do with anything?


1310
01:43:05.816 --> 01:43:08.651
Okay, okay, so we worked together.

1311
01:43:09.111 --> 01:43:11.153
It was an information exchange.

1312
01:43:11.363 --> 01:43:13.864
I got him first-class collars,
he got me good stories.


1313
01:43:14.032 --> 01:43:15.825
We were friends, for chrissake.

1314
01:43:15.992 --> 01:43:17.493
We'll drop that for the moment.

1315
01:43:17.994 --> 01:43:19.829
Care to comment on Pierce Patchett?

1316
01:43:19.996 --> 01:43:23.416
Patchett? You think he had something
to do with Vincennes getting iced?


1317
01:43:23.583 --> 01:43:28.629
Wendell, I'd like full and docile cooperation
on every topic.


1318
01:43:28.797 --> 01:43:31.298
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1319
01:43:32.843 --> 01:43:35.761
Everybody knows that Patchett's
worth a boatload of greenbacks.


1320
01:43:36.179 --> 01:43:38.055
But the man has hobbies too.

1321
01:43:38.265 --> 01:43:40.850
He bankrolls B-movies under the table.

1322
01:43:41.268 --> 01:43:42.893
And try this one on:

1323
01:43:43.103 --> 01:43:45.354
He's rumored to be a periodic
heroin sniffer.


1324
01:43:45.522 --> 01:43:48.607
All in all, a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o.


1325
01:43:48.775 --> 01:43:50.776
- And?
- And what?


1326
01:43:54.865 --> 01:43:58.659
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is
the key to every relationship.


1327
01:44:01.788 --> 01:44:03.372
He runs call girls.

1328
01:44:05.292 --> 01:44:08.377
Primo tail fixed up
to look like movie stars.


1329
01:44:11.131 --> 01:44:13.883
- And?
- Blackmail shit.


1330
01:44:14.050 --> 01:44:17.761
In my car, in the trunk,
under the rug ...


1331
01:44:18.054 --> 01:44:22.349
Patchett got me to photograph this cop
screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.


1332
01:44:22.517 --> 01:44:24.643
Looks just like Veronica Lake.

1333
01:44:24.811 --> 01:44:28.898
Wendell. Wendell. Leave him be.
I said, leave him be.


1334
01:44:29.065 --> 01:44:32.651
- Get him off me. Get him away from me.
- Back off, Wendell. Back off.


1335
01:45:16.863 --> 01:45:21.784
I wouldn't trade places with Edmund Exley
right now for all the whiskey in Ireland.


1336
01:45:22.702 --> 01:45:23.744
Dudley.

1337
01:45:25.872 --> 01:45:29.333
Dudley, I thought you were gonna
let the dumb bastard kill me.


1338
01:45:29.501 --> 01:45:32.670
And you, learn to pull your punches
a little better.


1339
01:45:32.879 --> 01:45:34.964
You can uncuff me now, fellas.

1340
01:45:40.595 --> 01:45:42.263
Fellas ...

1341
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:44.765
Dudley, we had a deal.

1342
01:45:44.933 --> 01:45:46.600
You, me and Patchett, we're a team.

1343
01:45:51.648 --> 01:45:52.982
Hush-hush.

1344
01:45:54.150 --> 01:45:56.151
- Anything?
- Nothing.


1345
01:45:56.319 --> 01:45:59.154
Meeks never made an arrest
the entire time he worked Vice?


1346
01:45:59.322 --> 01:46:01.323
Someone must've pulled the files.

1347
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:05.828
What about the daily report books?

1348
01:46:05.996 --> 01:46:07.830
They'd be buried in the basement.

1349
01:46:07.998 --> 01:46:09.248
Find them.

1350
01:46:40.238 --> 01:46:41.822
Did you talk to Exley?

1351
01:46:42.324 --> 01:46:44.074
Come in out of the rain.

1352
01:46:46.077 --> 01:46:48.162
I wanna know
what happened with Exley.


1353
01:46:49.914 --> 01:46:51.248
Just come in.

1354
01:46:52.626 --> 01:46:55.210
Are you gonna tell me
what happened with you and Exley?


1355
01:46:55.837 --> 01:46:57.171
We talked.

1356
01:46:57.756 --> 01:46:59.840
- So tell me about him.
- Later.


1357
01:47:00.008 --> 01:47:02.968
No! Now.

1358
01:47:05.513 --> 01:47:12.186
You fucked him.

1359
01:47:12.937 --> 01:47:14.980
I thought I was helping you.

1360
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:08.283
Bud, I'm glad you're here.
I need you to see this.


1361
01:48:17.836 --> 01:48:18.877
Wait.

1362
01:48:45.697 --> 01:48:47.239
Dudley killed Jack.

1363
01:48:47.866 --> 01:48:49.700
He wants you to kill me.

1364
01:48:52.787 --> 01:48:54.788
He showed you the photo, didn't he?

1365
01:48:55.623 --> 01:48:56.665
Didn't he?

1366
01:48:59.294 --> 01:49:02.755
Think. Goddamn you, think!

1367
01:49:04.007 --> 01:49:06.175
Get the fuck out of here.

1368
01:49:18.813 --> 01:49:20.189
Dudley.

1369
01:49:21.566 --> 01:49:23.734
I checked the daily report books.

1370
01:49:24.903 --> 01:49:28.363
Dudley, Buzz Meeks
and Stensland go way back.


1371
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:33.827
I knew Stensland lied to me.

1372
01:49:36.831 --> 01:49:39.917
Lefferts' mother ID'd
Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend.


1373
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:46.256
Stensland pretended he didn't know
Meeks or her the night that I met ...


1374
01:49:47.592 --> 01:49:49.051
Lynn.

1375
01:49:49.677 --> 01:49:51.261
Stensland and Meeks ...

1376
01:49:51.763 --> 01:49:53.430
what the hell were they up to?

1377
01:49:54.224 --> 01:49:57.643
I don't know, but I think
Stens killed Meeks over heroin.


1378
01:49:58.102 --> 01:49:59.228
What heroin?

1379
01:50:05.193 --> 01:50:08.779
Johnny Stompanato told me
that Meeks had heroin for sale.


1380
01:50:09.113 --> 01:50:10.781
Meeks ends up dead.

1381
01:50:11.282 --> 01:50:13.408
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.

1382
01:50:14.369 --> 01:50:16.119
It wasn't the Negroes.

1383
01:50:17.121 --> 01:50:19.081
The rape victim lied
in her statement.


1384
01:50:19.624 --> 01:50:23.252
The first guys to the Mercury coupe
were Breuning and Carlisle.


1385
01:50:23.461 --> 01:50:24.962
Dudley's guys.

1386
01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:27.172
They planted the shotguns.

1387
01:50:27.382 --> 01:50:30.717
And they'd have killed the Negroes, too,
if Jack and I hadn't shown up.


1388
01:50:31.719 --> 01:50:34.888
Dudley framed them because
they were Negroes and had records.


1389
01:50:35.223 --> 01:50:37.808
He knew there'd be no questions asked ...

1390
01:50:39.227 --> 01:50:41.603
if they were killed resisting arrest.

1391
01:50:42.647 --> 01:50:45.023
Somehow this is all connected
to Jack's angle.


1392
01:50:45.650 --> 01:50:47.484
Sid Hudgens ...

1393
01:50:47.652 --> 01:50:49.820
the pictures
to blackmail Ellis Loew ...


1394
01:50:50.905 --> 01:50:52.573
A kid got murdered.

1395
01:50:53.241 --> 01:50:56.285
If we're gonna figure this out,
we need to work together.


1396
01:51:01.165 --> 01:51:02.833
Why are you doing this?

1397
01:51:04.836 --> 01:51:06.670
The Nite Owl made you.

1398
01:51:08.506 --> 01:51:10.132
You wanna tear all that down?

1399
01:51:11.759 --> 01:51:13.510
With a wrecking ball.

1400
01:51:14.012 --> 01:51:15.846
You wanna help me swing it?

1401
01:51:28.151 --> 01:51:30.152
Let's go see Ellis Loew.

1402
01:51:30.695 --> 01:51:33.447
Find out what
the district attorney knows.


1403
01:51:38.661 --> 01:51:39.912
May I --?

1404
01:51:40.079 --> 01:51:43.123
Hey. You can't go in there.

1405
01:51:45.376 --> 01:51:47.127
Want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?

1406
01:51:47.295 --> 01:51:48.629
Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.

1407
01:51:48.796 --> 01:51:52.591
Tell him we're having a discussion
about the death of an actor at a motel.


1408
01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.926
These are the police.

1409
01:52:00.642 --> 01:52:01.850
What do you want?

1410
01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:06.355
I want DA bureau men to tail Dudley
Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.


1411
01:52:06.522 --> 01:52:10.025
I want you to get a judge to authorize
wiretaps on their home phones.


1412
01:52:10.234 --> 01:52:12.527
I want authorization
to check their bank records.


1413
01:52:13.071 --> 01:52:14.529
On what evidence?

1414
01:52:15.073 --> 01:52:16.740
Call it a hunch.

1415
01:52:17.992 --> 01:52:19.701
Absolutely not.

1416
01:52:19.911 --> 01:52:22.871
Dudley Smith is a highly decorated
member of this department.


1417
01:52:23.081 --> 01:52:25.290
I'm not gonna smear his
and Patchett's name --


1418
01:52:25.458 --> 01:52:26.708
Without what?

1419
01:52:27.085 --> 01:52:29.169
Them smearing yours first?

1420
01:52:29.337 --> 01:52:32.881
What do they have? Pictures of you
and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?


1421
01:52:35.259 --> 01:52:36.343
You have any proof?

1422
01:52:37.011 --> 01:52:38.720
The proof had his throat slit.

1423
01:52:40.098 --> 01:52:42.265
So far, you're not denying it.

1424
01:52:43.601 --> 01:52:45.560
I'm not gonna dignify this with answers.

1425
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:48.230
Now, if you gentlemen will excuse me ...

1426
01:52:48.439 --> 01:52:52.275
I have a press conference for Jack
Vincennes that I have to prepare for.


1427
01:53:02.954 --> 01:53:07.416
Unless you came in to wipe my ass,
I believe we're through.


1428
01:53:11.462 --> 01:53:16.425
Don't pull that good-cop-bad-cop crap.
I practically invented it.


1429
01:53:16.592 --> 01:53:18.885
So what if some homo actor is dead.

1430
01:53:19.053 --> 01:53:21.805
Boys, girls, 10 of them
get off the bus to L.A. every day.


1431
01:53:29.981 --> 01:53:33.525
- Pull him off me, Exley!
- I don't know how.


1432
01:53:36.404 --> 01:53:39.990
I know you think you're the A-number-one
hotshot, but here's the juice.


1433
01:53:40.158 --> 01:53:42.951
If I take you out, 10 lawyers
will take your place tomorrow.


1434
01:53:43.119 --> 01:53:44.661
They just won't come on a bus.

1435
01:53:58.926 --> 01:54:00.844
All right! Okay!

1436
01:54:01.262 --> 01:54:05.515
Dudley and Patchett, they --
Oh, my God.


1437
01:54:05.975 --> 01:54:10.020
I wouldn't play ball, so they set me up.
I gave in, but the kid heard everything ...


1438
01:54:11.856 --> 01:54:13.899
so they killed him.
- Why?


1439
01:54:14.067 --> 01:54:17.486
- What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
- Taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.


1440
01:54:17.945 --> 01:54:22.157
Because of those pictures,
I couldn't prosecute them.


1441
01:54:22.325 --> 01:54:24.534
Oh, Jesus. Help me up.

1442
01:54:33.836 --> 01:54:36.838
Is that how you used to run
the good-cop-bad-cop?


1443
01:54:38.633 --> 01:54:41.009
Patchett?

1444
01:55:15.294 --> 01:55:18.713
Looks like his bodyguard
had a conflict of interest.


1445
01:55:24.387 --> 01:55:25.720
Suicide note.

1446
01:55:25.888 --> 01:55:30.517
Says he killed Jack because Jack
had figured out a pornography scam.


1447
01:55:30.685 --> 01:55:32.477
Slicing himself open wasn't his idea.

1448
01:55:34.230 --> 01:55:37.983
- Two of his fingers are broken.
- They must have held him there.


1449
01:55:39.068 --> 01:55:40.986
Or drugged him.

1450
01:55:43.406 --> 01:55:45.907
I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.

1451
01:55:46.075 --> 01:55:49.161
Patchett's dead.
He sent you after me.


1452
01:55:50.913 --> 01:55:52.205
Lynn.

1453
01:55:53.124 --> 01:55:54.166
West Hollywood.

1454
01:55:54.333 --> 01:55:57.419
- They're closer than we are.
- I'll get the car. Keys.


1455
01:56:04.177 --> 01:56:07.596
Hey. We took her to the station
for safekeeping.


1456
01:56:08.598 --> 01:56:11.850
Hold her as Joan Smith.
And no one sees her unless I okay it.


1457
01:56:12.935 --> 01:56:16.938
Somebody worked her over.
She wouldn't say who.


1458
01:56:21.777 --> 01:56:23.111
- See you, Exley.
- Sure.


1459
01:56:26.532 --> 01:56:30.410
- We should talk to Lynn.
- You do it.


1460
01:56:30.661 --> 01:56:31.745
What are you gonna do?

1461
01:56:35.291 --> 01:56:37.751
I'm gonna talk to Sid Hudgens.

1462
01:56:37.919 --> 01:56:40.837
Compliment him on his
performance at the Victory Motel.


1463
01:56:41.005 --> 01:56:45.383
- Remember, Bud, we need evidence.
- I'll get the evidence.


1464
01:56:58.272 --> 01:57:00.273
Are you okay?

1465
01:57:01.984 --> 01:57:03.985
You okay?

1466
01:57:13.663 --> 01:57:15.330
Bud hates himself for what he did.

1467
01:57:16.874 --> 01:57:18.625
I know how he feels.

1468
01:57:21.295 --> 01:57:23.797
I need to know what you
can give me on Dudley Smith.


1469
01:57:26.175 --> 01:57:29.177
He's a police captain.
He's in business with Patchett.


1470
01:57:29.345 --> 01:57:30.637
I've never heard of him.

1471
01:57:35.142 --> 01:57:37.602
Do you have someplace you can stay?

1472
01:57:38.354 --> 01:57:40.272
I'll be okay.

1473
01:57:46.570 --> 01:57:49.197
Nobody goes in without official ID.

1474
01:57:53.536 --> 01:57:55.787
He's okay. Let him through.

1475
01:57:58.916 --> 01:58:00.625
What happened?

1476
01:58:00.793 --> 01:58:03.670
Somebody beat him to death
and stole a bunch of files.


1477
01:58:03.838 --> 01:58:06.214
Must have dug up garbage
on the wrong guy.


1478
01:58:06.382 --> 01:58:09.217
We got it narrowed down
to 1,000 suspects.


1479
01:58:09.385 --> 01:58:11.720
Sergeant White ...

1480
01:58:11.887 --> 01:58:13.388
Dispatch got a call for you.

1481
01:58:13.556 --> 01:58:17.058
Lieutenant Exley wants you
to meet him at the Victory Motel.


1482
01:58:50.676 --> 01:58:52.761
You wanted to meet here?

1483
01:58:54.347 --> 01:58:57.974
- You called it. I thought Hudgens was --
- Hudgens is dead.


1484
01:59:08.903 --> 01:59:10.904
Let's get out of here.

1485
01:59:17.828 --> 01:59:19.537
It's too late.

1486
02:00:08.754 --> 02:00:11.172
You figured this was a setup
and showed up anyway?


1487
02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:13.508
A lot of bad stuff happened here.

1488
02:00:13.676 --> 02:00:16.594
It's as good a place
as any for it to end.


1489
02:00:25.771 --> 02:00:27.564
Here. Clip.

1490
02:00:32.236 --> 02:00:35.780
All I ever wanted was to
measure up to my father.


1491
02:00:36.198 --> 02:00:37.991
Now's your chance.

1492
02:00:39.785 --> 02:00:42.412
He died in the
line of duty, didn't he?

1493
02:01:41.597 --> 02:01:42.722
Bud.

1494
02:02:40.906 --> 02:02:42.365
Goddamn it!

1495
02:03:42.676 --> 02:03:45.887
- You okay?
- Yeah.


1496
02:04:04.073 --> 02:04:05.990
Come on. Easy. Come on.

1497
02:04:12.831 --> 02:04:14.415
Move!

1498
02:04:36.355 --> 02:04:37.522
Rollo Tomasi.

1499
02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.278
- Who is he?
- You are.


1500
02:04:46.907 --> 02:04:49.450
You're the guy who gets away with it.

1501
02:04:52.746 --> 02:04:55.206
Jack knew it and so do I.

1502
02:05:21.316 --> 02:05:26.195
Are you gonna shoot me
or arrest me?


1503
02:05:31.535 --> 02:05:32.577
Good lad.

1504
02:05:33.662 --> 02:05:35.329
Always the politician.

1505
02:05:36.248 --> 02:05:38.499
Let me do the talking.

1506
02:05:38.667 --> 02:05:42.628
After I'm done,
they'll make you chief of detectives.


1507
02:06:09.573 --> 02:06:14.076
Hold up your badge
so they'll know you're a policeman.


1508
02:07:04.086 --> 02:07:07.380
You think you can talk
your way out of this, lieutenant?


1509
02:07:09.508 --> 02:07:10.800
No ...

1510
02:07:10.968 --> 02:07:13.302
but I think I can tell the truth.

1511
02:07:13.470 --> 02:07:16.055
During our investigation ...

1512
02:07:16.473 --> 02:07:20.101
of events surrounding
the Nite Owl case ...


1513
02:07:20.727 --> 02:07:23.855
Jack Vincennes, Bud White
and I learned the following.


1514
02:07:24.857 --> 02:07:27.316
Your golden boy's
throwing his whole life away.


1515
02:07:27.484 --> 02:07:29.902
The three Nite Owl suspects ...

1516
02:07:30.070 --> 02:07:33.030
while guilty of
kidnapping and rape ...


1517
02:07:33.323 --> 02:07:36.826
were innocent of the
multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.


1518
02:07:37.619 --> 02:07:39.579
The actual gunmen were most likely ...

1519
02:07:39.746 --> 02:07:44.625
Los Angeles Police Department officers
Michael Breuning and William Carlisle ...


1520
02:07:44.793 --> 02:07:46.794
and a third man ...

1521
02:07:47.045 --> 02:07:50.965
who may or may not have been
Captain Dudley Smith.


1522
02:07:51.717 --> 02:07:53.467
The objective:

1523
02:07:54.177 --> 02:07:56.721
The elimination
of another police officer ...


1524
02:07:56.889 --> 02:07:59.140
Richard Stensland ...

1525
02:07:59.725 --> 02:08:05.646
who, along with former L.A.P.D.
Officer Leland "Buzz" Meeks ...


1526
02:08:05.814 --> 02:08:09.984
also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of Captain Smith ...


1527
02:08:10.152 --> 02:08:13.988
and then betrayed him
over 25 pounds of heroin ...


1528
02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:17.325
the retrieval of which ...

1529
02:08:17.492 --> 02:08:20.995
was the ultimate motivation
behind the Nite Owl killings.


1530
02:08:23.707 --> 02:08:27.335
Beginning with the incarceration
of Mickey Cohen ...


1531
02:08:27.502 --> 02:08:32.965
Captain Smith has been assuming control
of organized crime in Los Angeles.


1532
02:08:33.133 --> 02:08:34.842
This includes the assassinations ...

1533
02:08:35.010 --> 02:08:37.678
of an unknown number
of Mickey Cohen lieutenants ...


1534
02:08:38.639 --> 02:08:42.099
the systematic blackmail
of city officials ...


1535
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:48.189
and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens ...


1536
02:08:49.191 --> 02:08:51.817
and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.

1537
02:08:54.529 --> 02:08:57.198
Captain Smith admitted as much to me ...

1538
02:08:57.991 --> 02:09:02.453
before I shot him
at the Victory Motel.


1539
02:09:04.331 --> 02:09:06.165
That's it.

1540
02:09:07.876 --> 02:09:09.919
Well ...

1541
02:09:10.337 --> 02:09:12.171
the press is gonna have
a field day.


1542
02:09:14.091 --> 02:09:18.010
This -- Christ, it'll stain the department
for years.


1543
02:09:18.178 --> 02:09:20.054
Decades.

1544
02:09:20.555 --> 02:09:23.474
If we can get the
kid to play ball ...

1545
02:09:24.184 --> 02:09:26.352
who's to say what happened?

1546
02:09:27.062 --> 02:09:29.563
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.

1547
02:09:29.731 --> 02:09:32.066
- Good idea.
- If we get the press to play.


1548
02:09:40.033 --> 02:09:43.494
You wanna tell me what
you're smiling about?


1549
02:09:48.375 --> 02:09:49.500
A hero.

1550
02:09:50.252 --> 02:09:52.253
How'd he know what
we're talking about?


1551
02:09:52.421 --> 02:09:54.338
He couldn't have heard us.

1552
02:09:56.383 --> 02:09:57.425
And?

1553
02:09:57.592 --> 02:09:59.760
In this situation ...

1554
02:09:59.928 --> 02:10:02.263
you'll need more than one.

1555
02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:11.605
It is with great pleasure
that I present this award ...


1556
02:10:11.773 --> 02:10:13.691
to Detective Lieutenant
Edmund Exley ...


1557
02:10:14.276 --> 02:10:17.486
two-time Medal of Valor recipient.

1558
02:10:26.371 --> 02:10:30.624
Next year, the L.A.P.D.
will move into its new facility.


1559
02:10:30.792 --> 02:10:32.543
With leaders like Edmund Exley ...

1560
02:10:32.711 --> 02:10:36.047
the image of fat cops stealing apples
will be left behind ...


1561
02:10:36.214 --> 02:10:39.717
and Los Angeles will finally
have the police force it deserves.


1562
02:10:53.899 --> 02:10:55.816
You just couldn't resist.

1563
02:10:56.276 --> 02:10:58.569
They're using me,
so for a while, I'm using them.


1564
02:11:00.822 --> 02:11:02.198
Come on.

1565
02:11:21.093 --> 02:11:22.760
Hey.

1566
02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:39.110
Thanks for the push.

1567
02:11:48.703 --> 02:11:50.162
Yeah.

1568
02:11:59.673 --> 02:12:02.383
Congratulations, 
Lieutenant Exley.

1569
02:12:05.345 --> 02:12:07.680
Some men get the world ...

1570
02:12:07.848 --> 02:12:11.225
others get ex-hookers
and a trip to Arizona.


1571
02:12:23.113 --> 02:12:26.907
- Bye.
- Bye.
