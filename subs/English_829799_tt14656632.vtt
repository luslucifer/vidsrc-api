If this is your ring,

164
00:10:31.085 --> 00:10:32.786
then you're harboring
an escaped felon.


165
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.221
I can pull your license

166
00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:35.889
and shut down
this little shit show for good.


167
00:10:35.923 --> 00:10:38.459
Guys, take it down--
Look, you spooked him!


168
00:10:38.492 --> 00:10:39.860
Don't even blame me!

169
00:10:39.893 --> 00:10:41.328
Hey! Hey! Stop!

170
00:10:43.397 --> 00:10:44.431
[grunts]

171
00:10:50.104 --> 00:10:51.171
Hey!

172
00:10:51.205 --> 00:10:52.506
[men grunts]

173
00:10:57.878 --> 00:10:59.313
[Koa groaning]

174
00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:01.248
[panting]

175
00:11:04.218 --> 00:11:06.320
Hey, relax. Hey, relax!

176
00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:08.355
One move and I'll light you up
like New Year's Eve.


177
00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:13.894
Hey!

178
00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:15.529
I saw you in pursuit.
Looked like you needed a hand.


179
00:11:15.562 --> 00:11:17.965
Oh yeah? No, I had him. Thanks.

180
00:11:17.998 --> 00:11:19.266
I'm the arresting officer.

181
00:11:22.136 --> 00:11:25.606
You're Robbie Cole, right?
You knew my dad.


182
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.874
Who is this?

183
00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:29.943
You're Ian Swann's son?

184
00:11:36.884 --> 00:11:39.553
Alright, Bernie,
Koa Kahale was my bounty.


185
00:11:39.586 --> 00:11:41.588
Tell the paymaster
to have my check ready.


186
00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:44.224
Your commission
is a standard 10% of bail.


187
00:11:44.258 --> 00:11:45.627
That's 100 bucks, man.

188
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.196
What? 10% of

189
00:11:49.229 --> 00:11:51.532
There was a typo.
His bail is actually a $1,000.


190
00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:53.500
I mean, the kid
is not exactly El Chapo.


191
00:11:53.534 --> 00:11:54.568
[laughs]

192
00:11:57.304 --> 00:11:58.472
Happy now?

193
00:11:58.505 --> 00:12:02.109
No. Barely covered my bar tab.

194
00:12:02.142 --> 00:12:05.245
Ryan, meet Savannah Tui,
homicide detective.


195
00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.147
Don't get fooled
by her pretty face.


196
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:08.582
She's a real pit-bull.

197
00:12:08.615 --> 00:12:11.218
I love you too, Robbie.

198
00:12:11.251 --> 00:12:14.054
So, you're Ian Swann's son?
I'm sorry for your loss.


199
00:12:14.088 --> 00:12:15.522
I've been on the case
from the start.


200
00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:17.324
Then you must have
some idea who did it.


201
00:12:17.358 --> 00:12:20.160
Look, Ryan, your dad and I
used to work together.


202
00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:21.962
He made a lot of enemies
on this island.


203
00:12:21.995 --> 00:12:24.331
Yeah. He had that effect
on people, so?


204
00:12:24.365 --> 00:12:26.433
If anything, what we've got
is too many suspects.


205
00:12:26.467 --> 00:12:27.635
Yeah, well gimme a list,
I'll run 'em down.


206
00:12:27.669 --> 00:12:29.269
You're not a cop.

207
00:12:29.303 --> 00:12:31.338
Yeah, I'm better than a cop.
Fewer rules.


208
00:12:31.372 --> 00:12:33.675
Oh, shit.
Another bounty hunter?


209
00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:36.610
This island's way too small
for another ass-kicking cowboy.


210
00:12:36.644 --> 00:12:39.046
Yeah. Well, if that's
what you thought of my dad,


211
00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:40.280
then you've got him all wrong,

212
00:12:40.314 --> 00:12:41.448
which means
you'll never solve shit.


213
00:12:41.482 --> 00:12:42.983
Hey.

214
00:12:43.016 --> 00:12:44.551
Savannah's the last cop
on this island


215
00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:46.220
that actually gives a damn.

216
00:12:46.253 --> 00:12:48.188
You're gonna want her
on your side.


217
00:12:48.222 --> 00:12:49.624
Give us a little time, Ryan.

218
00:12:49.657 --> 00:12:51.024
Why don't you take
a couple of days off


219
00:12:51.058 --> 00:12:52.426
and enjoy our beaches, okay?

220
00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:56.631
What did dad do to get himself--

221
00:12:56.664 --> 00:12:59.400
Hey, you got daddy issues?
Don't talk about him here.


222
00:12:59.433 --> 00:13:01.703
I know a good, quiet place.
Hannah's bar.


223
00:13:01.736 --> 00:13:03.570
You're a smart kid,
you'll find it.


224
00:13:03.604 --> 00:13:05.272
Meet me there at four.

225
00:13:18.218 --> 00:13:19.253
[sighs] Go ahead.

226
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:24.291
Oh, jeez.

227
00:13:24.324 --> 00:13:27.461
I know. Sharks.

228
00:13:27.494 --> 00:13:29.062
That... that isn't much
of a body.


229
00:13:29.096 --> 00:13:30.998
It's... it's just...

230
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:33.066
The body wasn't recovered
for at least 24 hours.


231
00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:37.070
The DNA was a match
to his Chicago PD records.


232
00:13:40.775 --> 00:13:42.476
They recovered a few things
from his car,


233
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:44.478
including his ID.
It's over there.


234
00:13:51.385 --> 00:13:52.986
Yeah. Yeah, that's uh...

235
00:13:54.588 --> 00:13:59.593
that's him.

So, he left you a message
same day he got killed?


241
00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:19.046
He must have known
he wasn't gonna make it.


242
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:20.682
Told me to contact you.

243
00:14:20.715 --> 00:14:23.183
That figures.
[chuckles]


244
00:14:23.217 --> 00:14:24.686
He always thought
I owed him one,


245
00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:27.287
but he was wrong
about that shit.


246
00:14:27.321 --> 00:14:29.556
What do you say
we make it interesting?


247
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.225
Wanna 20 to the winner?

248
00:14:38.232 --> 00:14:39.399
Nice.

249
00:14:39.433 --> 00:14:40.601
Thanks.

250
00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:43.170
Your dad was the real deal.

251
00:14:43.203 --> 00:14:45.239
Little hard to handle sometime.

252
00:14:45.272 --> 00:14:46.473
Yeah, tell me about it.

253
00:14:48.141 --> 00:14:50.544
He was hell of a bounty hunter,
though.


254
00:14:50.577 --> 00:14:52.613
Best I'd ever seen.
And a good partner.


255
00:14:54.481 --> 00:14:57.317
'Course, then there was
that little misunderstanding


256
00:14:57.351 --> 00:14:58.653
about your mom and I.

257
00:15:00.354 --> 00:15:02.089
Wait, that was you?

258
00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:05.793
I ain't proud of it,
but shit happens.


259
00:15:05.827 --> 00:15:08.428
Hey, shit happens.
They got divorced over it.


260
00:15:08.462 --> 00:15:12.299
You know that, right?
You--you ruined my childhood.


261
00:15:12.332 --> 00:15:15.269
It was nothing, okay.
Your dad over reacted.


262
00:15:15.302 --> 00:15:16.537
Your mom was half his age.

263
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.072
I think she just wanted
his attention.


264
00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:21.408
[indistinct chattering]

265
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.444
What, am I just supposed
to agree with you?


266
00:15:24.478 --> 00:15:26.748
Like I said,
I ain't proud of it.


267
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.483
I fucked up.

268
00:15:29.516 --> 00:15:31.786
I lost a great partner
and a friend.


269
00:15:33.821 --> 00:15:36.189
Do you know why my dad
came back to Hawaii?


270
00:15:38.325 --> 00:15:41.128
Your dad hadn't talked to me
in over 10 years, man.


271
00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:47.267
Word was, he was tracking
a real whale.


272
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:48.870
A big ass bounty.

273
00:15:48.903 --> 00:15:52.874
I figured he must have died
trying to collect it.


274
00:15:52.907 --> 00:15:55.375
You ever hear
of Terrance Billford?


275
00:15:55.409 --> 00:15:57.244
Yeah.

276
00:15:57.277 --> 00:15:59.814
Biggest bounty on record.
Set at eight figures.


277
00:15:59.847 --> 00:16:02.583
Here's why.

278
00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:05.285
Took out three cops
execution style.


279
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:08.856
I think Dad was obsessed
with him.


280
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.758
Well, he wasn't the only one.

281
00:16:10.792 --> 00:16:14.561
I mean everybody in the game
knows Billford's story.


282
00:16:14.595 --> 00:16:18.700
He skipped bail on murder,
drug trafficking charges.


283
00:16:18.733 --> 00:16:22.235
I mean, the son of a bitch
was El Gringo Narco,


284
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:24.304
biggest meth operation
in the Midwest.


285
00:16:24.338 --> 00:16:27.140
I mean, he killed cops,
even his own kin.


286
00:16:27.174 --> 00:16:28.843
I mean,
who allows bail on that?


287
00:16:28.876 --> 00:16:30.544
Judge set the bail
at 10 million.


288
00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:31.879
He didn't even think
that Billford


289
00:16:31.913 --> 00:16:33.413
or anybody else
could ever pay it.


290
00:16:33.447 --> 00:16:35.482
Billford paid in cash, man.

291
00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:37.785
Then he walks straight
out of the court.


292
00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:39.319
Nobody sees him again.

293
00:16:40.788 --> 00:16:43.223
I don't know...

294
00:16:43.256 --> 00:16:46.828
I think dad might have
finally found him.


295
00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:48.896
It's a small jungle, kid.

296
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.198
I mean, if there was a tiger
that big on the island,


297
00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:52.332
I'd know about it.

298
00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:53.668
Yeah, whatever happened,

299
00:16:55.602 --> 00:16:57.672
I'm not leaving until
I find out who killed him.


300
00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:01.441
-Nice game.
-Yeah, thanks.


301
00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:02.710
I mean, you let me win,
and we both know it.


302
00:17:02.744 --> 00:17:05.445
But I'm keeping this anyway.

303
00:17:05.479 --> 00:17:08.382
So uh, who's helping you
organize everything?


304
00:17:08.415 --> 00:17:09.483
Organize what?

305
00:17:09.516 --> 00:17:11.753
Funeral... the stuff.

306
00:17:11.786 --> 00:17:14.956
Right, yeah. Look um...

307
00:17:14.989 --> 00:17:18.660
yeah, that's me.
I guess, I uh...


308
00:17:18.693 --> 00:17:22.295
There's not much left
of him to bury.


309
00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:24.899
They gave me some things
they found in his car.


310
00:17:24.932 --> 00:17:26.834
Including this.

311
00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:30.604
Lelani Arms, yeah.
I know the hotel.


312
00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:31.973
Yeah, if dad had
a lead on Billford,


313
00:17:32.006 --> 00:17:34.976
I might still find
it here, right?


314
00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:38.245
Look, your dad was a harder
man than both of us.


315
00:17:38.278 --> 00:17:40.715
Whatever he was on to
got him killed.


316
00:17:40.748 --> 00:17:42.416
What are the chances
I can convince you


317
00:17:42.449 --> 00:17:43.818
to just stay out of this?

318
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:46.219
Look man, I didn't
come here for a tan.


319
00:17:46.253 --> 00:17:48.956
Right.

320
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.459
Well, don't think I'm letting
you score a bounty


321
00:17:52.492 --> 00:17:54.862
like Billford
right under my nose.


322
00:17:54.896 --> 00:17:57.230
Without splitting it 50-50.

323
00:18:02.536 --> 00:18:04.571
You wanna get to work or not?

324
00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:07.675
Let's do it.

325
00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:09.342
Let's do it.

326
00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:20.655
[indistinct chatter]

327
00:18:35.803 --> 00:18:37.304
Mr. Buckley.

328
00:18:38.773 --> 00:18:40.407
Oh, hello. How are you?

329
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.543
Wonderful to see you.
What a fabulous affair!


330
00:18:43.577 --> 00:18:47.581
Now, my husband is telling me
that your plans for Maui


331
00:18:47.614 --> 00:18:49.784
will make it a new
international business hub.


332
00:18:49.817 --> 00:18:52.820
Well, I know your husband.
He's a very wise man.


333
00:18:52.854 --> 00:18:55.022
And that's not
just because he chose you.


334
00:18:55.056 --> 00:18:57.591
Oh, thank you.

335
00:18:57.625 --> 00:19:01.729
Now, you love Hawaii,
I love Hawaii.


336
00:19:01.763 --> 00:19:03.330
We all love Hawaii.

337
00:19:03.363 --> 00:19:06.433
But, being said,
we have to diversify.


338
00:19:06.466 --> 00:19:08.435
We have to expand.

339
00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:11.939
And, with due respect,
these grandfather laws,


340
00:19:11.973 --> 00:19:14.842
I mean really, it's like
every third banyan tree


341
00:19:14.876 --> 00:19:16.677
is a sacred tribe.

342
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:20.014
We know. It's like the word
"profit" is a dirty word.


343
00:19:20.047 --> 00:19:23.985
Exactly. And that's why,
I'm supporting Thomas Kane.


344
00:19:24.018 --> 00:19:27.021
It should be our privilege
to expand opportunities


345
00:19:27.054 --> 00:19:28.623
for all of Hawaii.

346
00:19:28.656 --> 00:19:30.725
-Here, dad.
-Oh, good. Time for a toast.


347
00:19:30.758 --> 00:19:32.026
Excuse me.

348
00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:33.493
Everyone!

349
00:19:33.527 --> 00:19:34.662
[laughs]

350
00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:36.898
A toast to Thomas Kane.

351
00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:39.734
The next great senator
of Hawaii.


352
00:19:39.767 --> 00:19:42.569
[speaks in Hawaiian, chuckles]

353
00:19:42.602 --> 00:19:43.971
[speaks in Hawaiian]

354
00:19:44.005 --> 00:19:47.108
-And who is this handsome
young man?
-Mm.


355
00:19:47.141 --> 00:19:50.077
This is my son, Ern.
And this is Mrs. Tilly.


356
00:19:50.111 --> 00:19:52.579
-Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
-Well, it's always
a pleasure


357
00:19:52.612 --> 00:19:53.948
to meet
a well-mannered young man.


358
00:19:53.981 --> 00:19:55.650
[both chuckles]

359
00:19:55.683 --> 00:19:58.786
And, his mother's here tonight?

360
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.488
No, his... his mother
passed away a few years ago.


361
00:20:01.521 --> 00:20:03.758
But we're healing,
doing fine.


362
00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:05.893
Well, it would be our pleasure
to have you two


363
00:20:05.927 --> 00:20:07.728
for dinner one night.

364
00:20:07.762 --> 00:20:10.463
You just name the evening
and I will have our chefs


365
00:20:10.497 --> 00:20:12.900
whip up some fine
Louisiana cooking.


366
00:20:12.934 --> 00:20:14.769
That is an unexpected
invitation.


367
00:20:14.802 --> 00:20:16.037
-[Mrs. Tilly] Hmm.
-[Buck] What do you think, son?


368
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.104
Yeah. Yes, I am.

369
00:20:17.138 --> 00:20:18.673
Let's do then.

370
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.380
So, what's the plan?

371
00:20:27.414 --> 00:20:28.749
There's too many eyes
at the front desk.


372
00:20:28.783 --> 00:20:30.117
Let me give you the tour.

373
00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:43.097
Yeah, it's me.

374
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.967
You know that bastard, who used
to partner with Ian Swann?


375
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.400
He just showed up.

376
00:20:51.538 --> 00:20:54.507
-Jesus.
-Holy shit.


377
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.485
Well, whatever
they were looking for,


378
00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:07.454
-I doubt they found it.
-Why do you say that?


379
00:21:07.487 --> 00:21:10.858
Because they would've stopped
before they trashed everything.


380
00:21:12.994 --> 00:21:15.129
Hey.

381
00:21:15.162 --> 00:21:17.430
Whoever was here,
we must have just missed them.


382
00:21:17.464 --> 00:21:19.432
We'll try to think like
your old man, alright?


383
00:21:19.466 --> 00:21:20.768
He had evidence
on these bastards,


384
00:21:20.801 --> 00:21:22.136
where would he hide it?

385
00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:30.477
One of my guys spotted
Robbie Cole heading upstairs.


386
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.913
Cole?

387
00:21:31.946 --> 00:21:33.881
That's not
a fucking coincidence, is it?


388
00:21:44.792 --> 00:21:46.627
Is one of our men
still in the room?


389
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:47.795
Fuck no.

390
00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:56.569
Hey, hey. Check it out.

391
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.642
Billford.

392
00:22:01.676 --> 00:22:04.078
Yeah. He looks dead.

393
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.615
I can't let Cole find something
you fucking idiots missed.


394
00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:14.521
Housekeeping.

395
00:22:14.554 --> 00:22:15.890
No thanks.

396
00:22:16.924 --> 00:22:19.060
Turn down your bed, sir?

397
00:22:19.093 --> 00:22:20.928
Uh, bed's already turned down.

398
00:22:24.231 --> 00:22:26.067
Hey!

399
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.567
Get down!

400
00:22:29.103 --> 00:22:30.570
[grunts]

401
00:22:34.008 --> 00:22:36.677
[people screaming]

402
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.816
[Robbie grunts]
What the fuck!


403
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.252
She's gone. Stay low.

404
00:22:47.788 --> 00:22:49.156
Fuck, Nikki!

405
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.825
Shit!

406
00:23:11.245 --> 00:23:14.015
[grunts]

407
00:23:21.989 --> 00:23:25.860

[breathes heavily]

409
00:23:31.632 --> 00:23:32.767
It's gone to shit.

410
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.934
Jam the police band.

411
00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:35.236
Copy that.

412
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:38.639
[both grunts]

413
00:23:43.944 --> 00:23:46.213

[women scream]

415
00:24:11.906 --> 00:24:14.108
What's happening?

416
00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:15.810
The guy jumped overboard.

417
00:24:15.843 --> 00:24:17.711
From the tenth floor?
Is he dead?


418
00:24:17.745 --> 00:24:19.914
I can't tell.
He hit the goddamn pool pond.


419
00:24:19.947 --> 00:24:23.851
[indistinct chattering]

420
00:24:25.786 --> 00:24:28.756
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm so sorry.


421
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:30.891
There's been a disturbance
next door


422
00:24:30.925 --> 00:24:34.195
and I'm told that we need
to evacuate immediately.


423
00:24:34.228 --> 00:24:37.665
I apologize
but please allow Maui's best


424
00:24:37.698 --> 00:24:39.333
to escort you to your cars.

425
00:24:39.366 --> 00:24:41.001
And have a wonderful night.

426
00:24:41.035 --> 00:24:44.872
Don't forget to...
to vote for Thomas Kane.


427
00:24:44.905 --> 00:24:46.307
What the fuck is happening?

428
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.742
[indistinct whispering]

429
00:24:50.377 --> 00:24:52.313
I think he still might be
under the water.


430
00:24:52.346 --> 00:24:55.382
Well, finish him.
And don't stop till
the fucking body floats.


431
00:24:58.719 --> 00:24:59.753
[gasps]

432
00:24:59.787 --> 00:25:01.889
[people screaming]

433
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.830
[grunts]

00:25:09.864 --> 00:25:12.800
[pants]

435
00:25:14.768 --> 00:25:15.803
Freeze!

436
00:25:24.278 --> 00:25:26.147
Ryan Swann!

437
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.250
Let's go, come with me.
Somebody wants to talk to you.


438
00:25:31.152 --> 00:25:33.187
[indistinct chatter]

439
00:25:52.373 --> 00:25:53.874
Get in.

440
00:25:53.908 --> 00:25:55.743
-Where am I going?
-Nowhere.


441
00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:58.379
Now, get your ass in the car
or go back in the cell.


442
00:25:58.412 --> 00:25:59.446
Doesn't matter to me.

443
00:26:07.788 --> 00:26:09.490
Coffee?

444
00:26:09.523 --> 00:26:12.393
No thanks.

445
00:26:12.426 --> 00:26:15.930
Oh, that's a shame.
Double espresso.


446
00:26:15.963 --> 00:26:18.766
Vanilla spiced, seasoned huh.

447
00:26:20.201 --> 00:26:23.003
I'm Buckley.
Pleasure to meet you.


448
00:26:23.037 --> 00:26:24.838
Hey, you wanna tell me
what I'm doing here?


449
00:26:24.872 --> 00:26:27.174
Well, it's just
a friendly conversation,


450
00:26:27.208 --> 00:26:28.242
that's all.

451
00:26:30.477 --> 00:26:33.881
Do you know
why I have a double espresso?


452
00:26:35.883 --> 00:26:38.152
Because I didn't sleep
last night.


453
00:26:38.185 --> 00:26:41.789
Those fireworks in the hotel
were spectacular.


454
00:26:41.822 --> 00:26:43.457
I thought it was a goddamn
fourth of July.


455
00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.859
Put an early end
to a party of mine.


456
00:26:45.893 --> 00:26:47.027
I'm sorry to hear that.

457
00:26:47.061 --> 00:26:48.829
Hm.

458
00:26:48.862 --> 00:26:52.266
And I understand that
you are lucky to be alive.


459
00:26:54.201 --> 00:26:56.136
It's funny I don't feel lucky.

460
00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.440
I wouldn't either.
You lost your father.


461
00:26:59.473 --> 00:27:02.109
Very sorry about that.
My sympathies.


462
00:27:02.142 --> 00:27:03.177
Did you know him?

463
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.878
Well, I met him once only

464
00:27:04.912 --> 00:27:08.148
but he did made quite
an impression on me.


465
00:27:11.518 --> 00:27:13.020
Mr. Buckley?

466
00:27:13.053 --> 00:27:14.321
The gentleman over there
just told me


467
00:27:14.355 --> 00:27:15.789
to put his drink
on your bill.


468
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.565
You know him?

469
00:27:24.598 --> 00:27:27.134
I have no idea who he is.

470
00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:30.104
So, why don't you go over there
and ask him who he is?


471
00:27:30.137 --> 00:27:32.039
And if he doesn't have
the right answer,


472
00:27:32.072 --> 00:27:34.375
make sure that
he doesn't bother us again.


473
00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:16.116
Your man needed some fresh air.

474
00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:20.254
Do you mind?

475
00:28:21.922 --> 00:28:23.257
Well, let's see
you have managed


476
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.426
to invite yourself
to my table


477
00:28:25.459 --> 00:28:27.361
and interrupt my dinner.

478
00:28:27.394 --> 00:28:29.063
Now, who the hell are you?

479
00:28:29.096 --> 00:28:32.199
My name is Swann,
like the bird.


480
00:28:32.232 --> 00:28:35.336
Now, why would I buy you
a drink, Mr. Swann?


481
00:28:37.504 --> 00:28:39.239
I'm looking for a friend
of yours.


482
00:28:42.644 --> 00:28:45.112
I have no idea who this is.

483
00:28:45.145 --> 00:28:47.448
And if I did,
why the hell would I tell you?


484
00:28:47.481 --> 00:28:49.116
Now, if you don't mind,

485
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:52.519
I would like to go back to
my delicious Wagyu steak.


486
00:28:52.553 --> 00:28:56.156
You're funding a candidate
for Senator.


487
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.661
If this man is anyone near you,
you need my help.


488
00:28:59.694 --> 00:29:02.129
Are you saying that
this man is dangerous?


489
00:29:02.162 --> 00:29:05.332
The FBI thinks so.

490
00:29:05.366 --> 00:29:09.269
What about you, Mr. Swann?
Are... are you dangerous?


491
00:29:09.303 --> 00:29:11.105
Not to my friends.

492
00:29:11.138 --> 00:29:14.074
Well, that's too bad.
Because I have enough friends.


493
00:29:16.243 --> 00:29:18.345
[groans]

494
00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:25.052
Funny, he said
the same kind of thing.


495
00:29:29.022 --> 00:29:30.424
Thanks for the drink.

496
00:29:33.227 --> 00:29:37.064
You find out everything you can
about that son of a bitch.


497
00:29:37.097 --> 00:29:38.365
You got it, boss.

498
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.236
[groaning]

499
00:29:46.607 --> 00:29:49.376
Ah, such a tragedy, really.

500
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:54.281
Did he ever um, tell you why,
he came to Hawaii?


501
00:29:54.314 --> 00:29:58.585
No. No, we ah... we lost touch.

502
00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:01.388
Well, that's a shame,
now that he's gone.


503
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.394
Now, what... what transpired
last night though?


504
00:30:07.428 --> 00:30:10.297
I want to forget about it.

505
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.099
It's kind of hard to forget.

506
00:30:12.132 --> 00:30:13.300
People died.

507
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.636
I mean yes, but there's...

508
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:16.270
there's surveillance
cameras there


509
00:30:16.303 --> 00:30:18.640
and I'm told,
that it was self-defense.


510
00:30:18.673 --> 00:30:20.642
They fired at you first.

511
00:30:20.675 --> 00:30:22.342
And now you wouldn't wanna
make a mountain


512
00:30:22.376 --> 00:30:23.645
out of molehill.

513
00:30:23.678 --> 00:30:25.512
I would just leave it...
leave it alone.


514
00:30:28.015 --> 00:30:29.349
You're free to go.

515
00:30:39.526 --> 00:30:42.463
May I ask you uh,
what your plans are?


516
00:30:44.131 --> 00:30:45.165
I don't know.

517
00:30:46.567 --> 00:30:49.136
I'm thinking of sticking around.

518
00:30:49.169 --> 00:30:52.339
Yeah, someone killed my dad.

519
00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:53.675
I wanna know who.

520
00:30:53.708 --> 00:30:55.008
Hm, of course.

521
00:30:55.042 --> 00:30:56.210
You will, you'll find out.

522
00:30:56.243 --> 00:30:58.011
I mean, we're on it.

523
00:30:58.045 --> 00:31:00.414
This is Hawaii's best
looking after this.


524
00:31:00.447 --> 00:31:02.349
Why do you care?

525
00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:04.551
Well, because I believe
that there's some bad
players involved


526
00:31:04.585 --> 00:31:06.186
with your father's death.

527
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.255
I liked to see them
come to justice.


528
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:11.058
Yeah, so do I.

529
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:12.526
Yes.

530
00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:15.062
Now, a word of advice,

531
00:31:15.095 --> 00:31:18.098
I would leave this island
and not come back.


532
00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:21.201
You've got a bright future,
but it's on the mainland,


533
00:31:21.235 --> 00:31:23.070
not here.

534
00:31:23.103 --> 00:31:24.471
If you stay till tomorrow, I...

535
00:31:24.505 --> 00:31:27.508
I can't promise
I can protect you.


536
00:31:27.541 --> 00:31:29.343
Protect me from who?

537
00:31:29.376 --> 00:31:30.577
I don't know.

538
00:31:30.611 --> 00:31:32.379
Maybe... maybe yourself.

539
00:31:32.412 --> 00:31:34.081
Oh, and by the way,

540
00:31:34.114 --> 00:31:36.416
there's a midnight flight,
Hawaiian airlines,


541
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.586
and I understand
that they actually serve a meal.


542
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.288
Well, who knows
they might throw in


543
00:31:41.321 --> 00:31:44.157
a complimentary pineapple
or a coconut.


544
00:31:44.191 --> 00:31:45.559
Something like that.

545
00:31:46.861 --> 00:31:48.462
Have a good trip.

546
00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:55.803
[grunts]

547
00:32:03.645 --> 00:32:06.079
Ryan! What's going on?

548
00:32:06.113 --> 00:32:07.414
I heard you just got arrested.

549
00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:08.750
Well, they haven't even
charged me


550
00:32:08.783 --> 00:32:10.350
thanks to some guy
named Buckley.


551
00:32:10.384 --> 00:32:11.819
Oh, of course.

552
00:32:11.853 --> 00:32:13.655
He has a lot of influence
on this island.


553
00:32:13.688 --> 00:32:15.623
So, I noticed.

554
00:32:15.657 --> 00:32:17.457
So, I've been taken off
your father's case.


555
00:32:17.491 --> 00:32:19.593
Apparently being seen with you
is bad for my career.


556
00:32:19.627 --> 00:32:21.228
None of this makes any sense.

557
00:32:21.261 --> 00:32:22.462
You know,
what I'm really worried about


558
00:32:22.496 --> 00:32:24.364
right now is Robbie.

559
00:32:24.398 --> 00:32:26.533
I've been looking for him.
Was he with you last night?


560
00:32:26.567 --> 00:32:27.869
Yeah, last time I saw him,

561
00:32:27.902 --> 00:32:29.637
he had a bag pulled
over his head.


562
00:32:29.671 --> 00:32:31.204
Oh, my God.

563
00:32:31.238 --> 00:32:33.641
Yeah, we have to do something.

564
00:32:33.675 --> 00:32:36.276
Look, right now the police
are no help.


565
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.746
The whole case
has been put on ice.


566
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.849
But there's another way
we can find out
what happened to Robbie.


567
00:32:41.883 --> 00:32:44.117
There's some friends of mine
I want you to meet. Come on.


568
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:49.256
Welcome to the Rip Tide Club.

569
00:32:49.289 --> 00:32:51.826
Nice place.
It's kind of above my pay grade.


570
00:32:51.859 --> 00:32:54.261
Don't worry,
your money's no good here.


571
00:32:54.294 --> 00:32:55.663
This is Nikki's club.

572
00:32:55.697 --> 00:32:57.431
When I need intel
the force can't get,


573
00:32:57.464 --> 00:32:59.433
she always comes through.

574
00:32:59.466 --> 00:33:00.868
I'm about to show you

575
00:33:00.902 --> 00:33:02.402
how we know
what's going on in this club


576
00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:05.673
way before the cops do.
This way.


577
00:33:09.644 --> 00:33:13.146
[indistinct chattering,
whistling]


578
00:33:18.452 --> 00:33:21.188
Gentlemen,
I need you to clear out.


579
00:33:21.221 --> 00:33:23.256
Drinks on the house
at the bar.


580
00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:31.498
Ladies, ladies, gather around.

581
00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:35.202
These ladies have given me
more leads than the entire MPD.


582
00:33:35.235 --> 00:33:36.804
-[all chuckles]
-Sooner or later,


583
00:33:36.838 --> 00:33:39.306
every bad boy on this island
winds up on this club.


584
00:33:39.339 --> 00:33:40.708
And after a few drinks,

585
00:33:40.742 --> 00:33:41.876
they just love to talk
to the girls.


586
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:43.510
Damn right.

587
00:33:43.543 --> 00:33:44.946
Kai may look sweet,
but don't cross her.


588
00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:46.848
She did two tours
in Afghanistan.


589
00:33:46.881 --> 00:33:49.516
Semper Fi. Muah!

590
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:51.618
Oh, it's nice to meet you. Oh!

591
00:33:51.653 --> 00:33:53.520
Hey, I like the vibe back here.

592
00:33:53.553 --> 00:33:54.588
[Gerry chuckles]

593
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:55.957
Relax, baby.

594
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.925
You look like a rabbit
in a fox den.


595
00:33:57.959 --> 00:33:59.559
[girls chuckle]

596
00:33:59.593 --> 00:34:01.796
We wanna get a line on Robbie.

597
00:34:01.829 --> 00:34:04.932
You can trust everybody here.
They're devoted to the cause.


598
00:34:04.966 --> 00:34:06.600
What cause?

599
00:34:06.634 --> 00:34:09.236
The locals, their land
and their families.


600
00:34:09.269 --> 00:34:11.271
You taken him
to Paradise City yet?


601
00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:12.640
What's that, another club?

602
00:34:12.674 --> 00:34:14.474
[chuckles]
It's better than any club.


603
00:34:14.508 --> 00:34:17.210
It's the most beautiful place
on the island.


604
00:34:17.244 --> 00:34:18.578
And we want to keep it that way.

605
00:34:18.612 --> 00:34:19.947
The only problem is Buckley.

606
00:34:19.981 --> 00:34:21.481
I take it you're not a fan?

607
00:34:21.515 --> 00:34:22.850
Oh, hell no!

608
00:34:22.884 --> 00:34:24.618
Mining is off-limits in Hawaii.

609
00:34:24.652 --> 00:34:26.520
Especially the sacred mountains.

610
00:34:26.553 --> 00:34:29.489
There are clan Elders
who control Home Land resources.


611
00:34:29.523 --> 00:34:31.425
And Buckley,
bought off all of them.


612
00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:32.994
What... what that's
gotta to do with...


613
00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:34.561
with Robbie? Or my dad?

614
00:34:34.594 --> 00:34:35.930
Maybe nothing.

615
00:34:35.963 --> 00:34:37.932
Or maybe that's what
last night was all about


616
00:34:37.965 --> 00:34:41.301
and the reason why Buck
is so interested in you.


617
00:34:41.334 --> 00:34:42.904
Okay, ladies.

618
00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:45.238
You've all heard about the hit
at the Lelani Hotel.


619
00:34:45.272 --> 00:34:47.407
I need you to go out there
tonight, work the floor.


620
00:34:47.441 --> 00:34:49.811
Find out who wants to brag on
what happened to Robbie.


621
00:34:49.844 --> 00:34:51.311
-We got it.
-Alright. Go, girls.


622
00:34:51.344 --> 00:34:52.647
-I love you, Ma.
-Bye, Ryan.


623
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.782
Go. Go, girls go!

624
00:34:54.816 --> 00:34:57.350
Bye, Ryan.

625
00:34:57.384 --> 00:34:58.886
Get out there.

626
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.788
That was a nice place.

627
00:35:00.822 --> 00:35:02.322
It was only the lunch crowd.

628
00:35:02.355 --> 00:35:04.257
-I know, right.
-[Ryan chuckles]


629
00:35:06.761 --> 00:35:10.597
I know it's only been 24 hours
since you've been locked up.


630
00:35:10.631 --> 00:35:12.767
How you holding up?

631
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.570
I'm feeling kinda nuts,
to be honest, you know?


632
00:35:16.603 --> 00:35:19.941
Back at the hotel, it was crazy.

633
00:35:19.974 --> 00:35:21.709
Tell me about it.

634
00:35:21.743 --> 00:35:24.779
I've never killed anyone before.

635
00:35:24.812 --> 00:35:26.681
I put a guy in a wheelchair
once in Jersey,


636
00:35:26.714 --> 00:35:28.983
but never killed anybody.

637
00:35:29.016 --> 00:35:31.284
I know. I pulled your file.

638
00:35:31.318 --> 00:35:33.855
Non-lethal force.

639
00:35:33.888 --> 00:35:35.522
I admire that,

640
00:35:35.555 --> 00:35:36.858
as long as you don't
get yourself killed.


641
00:35:36.891 --> 00:35:39.627
[chuckles]

642
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.595
You know, Robbie's gone.

643
00:35:41.629 --> 00:35:43.497
I should be in jail,
but I'm not.


644
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.733
And as far as I can tell,
nobody else is.


645
00:35:45.767 --> 00:35:47.902
Law doesn't work that way here.

646
00:35:47.935 --> 00:35:49.436
Buck will spin it.

647
00:35:49.469 --> 00:35:51.005
Yeah, well he already has.

648
00:35:51.038 --> 00:35:52.874
Local news just claimed
that a gas main blew


649
00:35:52.907 --> 00:35:55.308
at the Lelani,
nothing about a shootout.


650
00:35:55.342 --> 00:35:56.443
Can you believe it?

651
00:35:56.476 --> 00:35:57.912
He's that deep into this town?

652
00:35:57.945 --> 00:36:01.082
Yes, and worse,
word is one of the Elders


653
00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:04.551
was a hold out
on Buck's mining scheme.


654
00:36:04.584 --> 00:36:06.386
One day he just disappeared.

655
00:36:06.419 --> 00:36:09.690
There's no body,
so no investigation.


656
00:36:09.724 --> 00:36:11.092
But there were rumors...

657
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.727
[man screaming]

658
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.762
That the Elder was still alive

659
00:36:14.796 --> 00:36:16.798
when they dumped him
into Haleakala.


660
00:36:20.868 --> 00:36:22.703
You think that's
what happened to Robbie?


661
00:36:22.737 --> 00:36:25.006
Ah, no.
Don't you count Robbie out.


662
00:36:25.039 --> 00:36:27.407
He can take care of himself.

663
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.945
Okay still, we can't just
here and wait for a lead.


664
00:36:30.978 --> 00:36:32.445
What do you have in mind?

665
00:36:32.479 --> 00:36:33.915
I, uh...

666
00:36:36.951 --> 00:36:39.987
can you... can you take me
to the crime scene?


667
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:41.789
Where they shot my father down.

668
00:36:41.823 --> 00:36:44.457
There's not much to see,
the waves have them washed away.


669
00:36:46.593 --> 00:36:49.864
But yeah, what are you doing
tomorrow morning?


670
00:36:49.897 --> 00:36:51.398
Free as a bird.

671
00:36:51.431 --> 00:36:52.800
-Great.
-[chuckles]


672
00:36:52.834 --> 00:36:55.402
Yeah. I'll see you.

673
00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:34.942
It happened in this cove.

674
00:37:34.976 --> 00:37:37.912
There were shell cases
everywhere.


675
00:37:37.945 --> 00:37:41.448
And your dad's rental car
was up there.


676
00:37:41.481 --> 00:37:42.884
It was shot to pieces.

677
00:37:42.917 --> 00:37:44.484
He must have put up
a good fight.


678
00:37:44.517 --> 00:37:45.953
Yeah, he always did.

679
00:37:52.793 --> 00:37:54.061
You okay?

680
00:37:54.095 --> 00:37:55.663
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

681
00:37:55.696 --> 00:37:57.597
Just ah, just give me
a moment, yeah?


682
00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:06.741
What's that?

683
00:38:06.774 --> 00:38:08.843
It's a very sophisticated
piece of equipment.


684
00:38:11.946 --> 00:38:13.446
That's a beach ball.

685
00:38:15.883 --> 00:38:17.151
It's about to become a part

686
00:38:17.184 --> 00:38:19.754
of an underwater
metal detector.


687
00:38:19.787 --> 00:38:21.521
$19.99 on Amazon.

688
00:38:21.554 --> 00:38:22.690
It's... it's brilliant.

689
00:38:22.723 --> 00:38:25.693
-It really is.
-Yes, it is.


690
00:38:25.726 --> 00:38:28.863
The dive team combed
this entire cove.


691
00:38:28.896 --> 00:38:31.098
But you know what,
I think it's worth a try.


692
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.175
[Ryan] <i>Little Swann,</i>

693
00:38:41.208 --> 00:38:42.977
<i>we haven't talked much</i>
<i>in a while.</i>


694
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.246
<i>Just wanted to give you</i>
<i>some advice.</i>


695
00:38:45.279 --> 00:38:48.149
<i>You wanna be in this</i>
<i>fucked up business?</i>


696
00:38:55.588 --> 00:38:57.658
Drop the gun! Now!

697
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:03.563
<i>Yep, you're a good kid.</i>

698
00:39:03.596 --> 00:39:06.133
<i>Yeah, I love you, son.</i>
<i>I gotta go.</i>


699
00:39:14.976 --> 00:39:16.609
Hey, what do you got?

700
00:39:16.644 --> 00:39:18.012
I'm not sure.

701
00:39:54.315 --> 00:39:57.785
Sleep is so important.

702
00:39:57.818 --> 00:40:02.056
And it's something that
I did not get any up last night.


703
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:04.225
[groans]

704
00:40:04.258 --> 00:40:06.060
How did you sleep?

705
00:40:10.097 --> 00:40:12.633
Ain't that California King
something?


706
00:40:12.666 --> 00:40:15.102
I think it's the uh,
the memory foam.


707
00:40:15.136 --> 00:40:18.005
Ain't nothing like
in the world.


708
00:40:18.039 --> 00:40:20.641
The bed was fine.

709
00:40:20.674 --> 00:40:23.177
But the doors and the windows
were bolted shut.


710
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.979
That's a precaution.

711
00:40:25.012 --> 00:40:27.948
Now, old buddy, old pal,

712
00:40:27.982 --> 00:40:31.719
did you attack my people
at a hotel last night?


713
00:40:31.752 --> 00:40:34.088
Did you kill Ian Swann?

714
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:35.289
I... I don't know.

715
00:40:35.322 --> 00:40:37.291
What... what is an Ian Swann?

716
00:40:37.324 --> 00:40:39.026
What about his son?

717
00:40:42.696 --> 00:40:46.233
I think that my guys
dropped you on your head


718
00:40:46.267 --> 00:40:48.601
when they were bringing
you here.


719
00:40:48.636 --> 00:40:52.039
The kid you were with last night
was picked up by the cops.


720
00:40:52.073 --> 00:40:55.943
But because they're friends
of mine, I let him go.


721
00:40:55.976 --> 00:40:59.046
Why make enemies
when you could make friends?


722
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.216
But you... you're here
as a professional favor.


723
00:41:02.249 --> 00:41:06.053
Oh, so you did me a favor
by kidnapping me?


724
00:41:06.087 --> 00:41:08.289
Kidnapping! Sir...

725
00:41:08.322 --> 00:41:10.157
That's what this is.

726
00:41:14.862 --> 00:41:16.630
Oh, great.

727
00:41:16.664 --> 00:41:17.798
Voila.

728
00:41:17.832 --> 00:41:21.268
You are free to go as you wish.

729
00:41:21.302 --> 00:41:26.006
Word is you got a lot riding
on this Kane getting elected.


730
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.708
Why didn't you run yourself?

731
00:41:27.741 --> 00:41:29.310
What's the number one rule
of Hawaii?


732
00:41:29.343 --> 00:41:30.845
Everyone's family.

733
00:41:30.878 --> 00:41:33.147
Everyone is family
except for us.


734
00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.117
We've been here for years
and you know what, the locals,


735
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.751
still think of us as...

736
00:41:37.785 --> 00:41:40.221
as tourists, as colonizers.

737
00:41:40.254 --> 00:41:43.691
I can raise a fucking
mountain from the sea,


738
00:41:43.724 --> 00:41:46.994
name it after myself
and still...


739
00:41:47.027 --> 00:41:48.362
You'd still be a tourist.

740
00:41:48.395 --> 00:41:49.763
Still.

741
00:41:50.731 --> 00:41:51.765
[sighs]

742
00:41:51.799 --> 00:41:53.234
But there is a...

743
00:41:53.267 --> 00:41:55.202
There is hope for these people.

744
00:41:55.236 --> 00:41:57.905
A lot of untapped resources.

745
00:41:57.938 --> 00:41:59.840
Yeah, and you'll get
quite a slice I'm sure


746
00:41:59.874 --> 00:42:01.275
if he gets elected, right?

747
00:42:01.308 --> 00:42:05.746
What's good for me,
is good for Hawaii.


748
00:42:05.779 --> 00:42:07.114
You must be hungry.

749
00:42:07.148 --> 00:42:08.282
Are you hungry?

750
00:42:08.315 --> 00:42:09.917
Please.

751
00:42:10.985 --> 00:42:12.286
Well, here.

752
00:42:15.923 --> 00:42:17.258
Suit yourself.

753
00:42:17.291 --> 00:42:20.194
You know,
my guys did some extensive


754
00:42:20.227 --> 00:42:22.830
background research on you.

755
00:42:22.863 --> 00:42:25.799
And you know what,
it was a page turner.


756
00:42:25.833 --> 00:42:27.935
I... I couldn't put it down.

757
00:42:27.968 --> 00:42:30.838
Well, don't believe
everything you read.


758
00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:34.875
Mm-hm. Chicago, what about
Chicago? You left the force.


759
00:42:34.909 --> 00:42:36.443
A great pension. Why?

760
00:42:36.477 --> 00:42:38.312
Why would you do
something like that?


761
00:42:38.345 --> 00:42:41.048
I didn't love bein' a cop.

762
00:42:41.081 --> 00:42:44.752
But bounty hunting,
it's a whole different animal.


763
00:42:44.785 --> 00:42:46.954
There's no rules, no superiors.

764
00:42:46.987 --> 00:42:49.857
And I can learn a lot
about the scum I'm chasing.


765
00:42:51.525 --> 00:42:52.927
You know,

766
00:42:54.395 --> 00:42:57.398
there's a story
going around about you.


767
00:42:57.431 --> 00:43:00.868
Oh good. I love a good story.

768
00:43:00.901 --> 00:43:02.870
Especially if it's about me.

769
00:43:04.872 --> 00:43:08.943
You're no billionaire,
although you'd like to be.


770
00:43:08.976 --> 00:43:11.412
And this whole act of yours
is being bankrolled


771
00:43:11.445 --> 00:43:14.982
by Terrance Billford
and his cartel buddies.


772
00:43:15.015 --> 00:43:16.417
That's what I hear.

773
00:43:18.986 --> 00:43:23.057
Ern, go upstairs and fire up
your video game.


774
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.291
I'll be right up.

775
00:43:25.993 --> 00:43:28.996
Now, that is a good story.
Now, who is this?


776
00:43:29.029 --> 00:43:30.998
Who is this Blifferd...
Billford...


777
00:43:31.031 --> 00:43:32.433
Who is this?

778
00:43:32.466 --> 00:43:35.002
Well, real piece of shit,
slung meth.


779
00:43:35.035 --> 00:43:38.038
Big time operator
back in the day though.
Made a fortune.


780
00:43:38.072 --> 00:43:41.041
Well, I'm sure
he didn't force people
to take drugs.


781
00:43:41.075 --> 00:43:43.410
If they did, it was on them.

782
00:43:45.112 --> 00:43:47.214
You're right to be scared.

783
00:43:47.248 --> 00:43:50.284
Cause it wouldn't take much for
me to blow the whistle on you.


784
00:43:50.317 --> 00:43:52.353
You know, see if you're running
this campaign


785
00:43:52.386 --> 00:43:54.021
with laundered drug money...

786
00:43:54.054 --> 00:43:56.490
The only thing
that I'm scared of is me.


787
00:43:56.523 --> 00:44:00.060
And I am me, so...

788
00:44:00.094 --> 00:44:02.029
There's nothing to be scared of.

789
00:44:02.062 --> 00:44:04.231
But what about you, Robbie?

790
00:44:04.265 --> 00:44:07.201
Maybe it's time
that you tell me


791
00:44:07.234 --> 00:44:09.203
where you heard
this good story


792
00:44:09.236 --> 00:44:12.306
and who else knows about it.

793
00:44:12.339 --> 00:44:14.241
And why the fuck
would I do that?


794
00:44:19.246 --> 00:44:22.916
[grunts]

795
00:44:25.452 --> 00:44:27.321
[people chattering, laughing]

796
00:44:27.354 --> 00:44:28.555
Any luck?

797
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:30.357
The FBI gave us this tech.

798
00:44:30.391 --> 00:44:32.593
It's supposed to help
reconfigure damaged data.


799
00:44:32.627 --> 00:44:34.595
What about water damage?

800
00:44:34.629 --> 00:44:36.497
We're about to find out.

801
00:44:43.103 --> 00:44:44.371
Here we go.

802
00:44:44.405 --> 00:44:46.440
Hey, let me see.

803
00:44:46.473 --> 00:44:48.142
They're on the beach.

804
00:44:48.175 --> 00:44:49.543
Do you recognize him?

805
00:44:49.576 --> 00:44:52.012
I can't see his face.

806
00:44:52.046 --> 00:44:56.483
Dad's body is bleeding heavy,
drawin' in the sharks.


807
00:44:58.653 --> 00:45:01.989
Fuck. He never had a chance.

808
00:45:02.022 --> 00:45:03.390
That's just weird.

809
00:45:03.424 --> 00:45:05.225
What's weird?

810
00:45:05.259 --> 00:45:08.329
That beach hasn't seen
a single shark attack ever.


811
00:45:08.362 --> 00:45:10.197
There's no access.
They get hung up on the coral.


812
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.335
He's dead. I saw the body,
the blood tests.


813
00:45:14.368 --> 00:45:16.203
I think there are people
who might be able to help us.


814
00:45:16.236 --> 00:45:18.138
They watch over this part
of the island.


815
00:45:18.172 --> 00:45:20.107
A watch over?

816
00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.042
They still honor the old ways.

817
00:45:22.076 --> 00:45:23.444
Well, where do they live?

818
00:45:23.477 --> 00:45:26.213
This place Buck calls
Paradise City.


819
00:45:27.682 --> 00:45:31.485
Look, I'll take you there
if you promise


820
00:45:31.518 --> 00:45:33.187
you'll behave yourself.

821
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.888
Behave myself?

822
00:45:34.922 --> 00:45:37.224
Uh, they're pretty touchy
about strangers.


823
00:45:45.065 --> 00:45:46.934
Yeah?

824
00:45:46.967 --> 00:45:49.203
I just saw that guy
you asked about...


825
00:45:49.236 --> 00:45:50.938
Swann.

826
00:45:50.971 --> 00:45:52.506
Where did he go?

827
00:45:52.539 --> 00:45:54.308
I don't know, but he's headed
to Paradise City.


828
00:45:54.341 --> 00:45:55.943
Right, I got it.

829
00:46:03.517 --> 00:46:05.085
It's just beyond
these mountains.


830
00:46:05.119 --> 00:46:06.920
I thought you said
this was a shortcut?


831
00:46:06.954 --> 00:46:08.288
It is to me.

832
00:46:08.322 --> 00:46:10.157
Come on, it's worth it,
I promise.


833
00:46:39.486 --> 00:46:41.522
Oh, you're gonna walk
through there barefoot?


834
00:46:41.555 --> 00:46:45.192
Yup. You ought
to try it sometimes.


835
00:46:45.225 --> 00:46:46.593
Connects you to the earth.

836
00:46:46.628 --> 00:46:48.996
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty
connected to my boots.


837
00:46:49.029 --> 00:46:50.497
Fine, suit yourself.

838
00:46:55.335 --> 00:46:58.305
When I was a little girl,
we never wore shoes here.


839
00:46:58.338 --> 00:47:00.675
This is considered sacred land.

840
00:47:00.708 --> 00:47:02.476
You grew up here?

841
00:47:02.509 --> 00:47:06.180
Yup. My mom and her sister
raised me here when I was a kid.


842
00:47:06.213 --> 00:47:07.749
I never knew who my dad was.

843
00:47:07.782 --> 00:47:11.518
But that didn't matter,
'cause this place, the people...


844
00:47:11.552 --> 00:47:13.554
it's all the family
I ever needed.


845
00:47:18.525 --> 00:47:20.294
Are we almost there?

846
00:47:20.327 --> 00:47:21.495
Just few more minutes.

847
00:47:21.528 --> 00:47:22.764
Okay, well just give me a sec

848
00:47:22.797 --> 00:47:24.031
to return
some of my sacred


849
00:47:24.064 --> 00:47:26.233
water back to the earth.

850
00:47:26.266 --> 00:47:28.569
Oh, shit.

851
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:33.373
[groans]

852
00:47:53.695 --> 00:47:56.230
Holy shit!

853
00:47:56.263 --> 00:47:59.667
Whoa! Hey, hey guys...
Sorry, I was just ah...


854
00:47:59.701 --> 00:48:02.569
Shut your mouth, haole!
What you doing here?


855
00:48:02.603 --> 00:48:05.439
He's with me! He's with me.

856
00:48:05.472 --> 00:48:06.440
Savannah!

857
00:48:06.473 --> 00:48:07.642
Yeah.

858
00:48:07.675 --> 00:48:11.545
Hey! Auntie, look who's here.

859
00:48:11.578 --> 00:48:14.214
Savannah!

860
00:48:14.248 --> 00:48:17.451
My little girl,
so glad to see you.


861
00:48:17.484 --> 00:48:21.088
But why you bring this
smooth talking haole over here?


862
00:48:21.121 --> 00:48:24.358
I came to this island to find
out who killed my father.


863
00:48:24.391 --> 00:48:26.326
His name's Ian Swann.

864
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.629
Is that true?

865
00:48:29.631 --> 00:48:31.532
You're a friend or foe?

866
00:48:31.565 --> 00:48:34.134
I was a fighter but yeah,
I'm feeling really peaceful


867
00:48:34.167 --> 00:48:35.335
looking at that Remington.

868
00:48:35.369 --> 00:48:36.738
Do you think you
could just ah...


869
00:48:36.771 --> 00:48:38.372
Yeah, that's nice. Thanks.

870
00:48:38.405 --> 00:48:41.074
We can always use
another fighter.


871
00:48:41.108 --> 00:48:43.377
But you don't try fighting
with me, okay,


872
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.713
because you no can't win.

873
00:48:45.747 --> 00:48:48.115
[men laugh]

874
00:48:48.148 --> 00:48:49.550
Ah-huh-huh.

875
00:48:52.352 --> 00:48:56.423
Who's hungry? Let's eat.

876
00:48:56.456 --> 00:48:58.860
After you.

877
00:48:58.893 --> 00:49:00.294
No, okay. That's fine.

878
00:49:00.327 --> 00:49:01.796
Come on.

879
00:49:16.911 --> 00:49:19.279
[children laughing]

880
00:49:30.625 --> 00:49:33.895
Welcome to Paliuli village.

881
00:49:33.928 --> 00:49:35.730
Locals call it Paradise City.

882
00:49:35.763 --> 00:49:37.331
Lives up to the name,
don't you think?


883
00:49:37.364 --> 00:49:38.565
Yeah, I can see that.

884
00:49:44.706 --> 00:49:48.542
They're the only homestead that
refused to be bribed by Buck.


885
00:49:48.575 --> 00:49:50.210
They're the resistance.

886
00:50:02.322 --> 00:50:07.594
[speaking Hawaiian]

887
00:50:07.629 --> 00:50:09.529
What's he saying?

888
00:50:09.563 --> 00:50:12.232
He said he wants you to prove
that you're Ian Swann's son.


889
00:50:12.265 --> 00:50:13.600
Yeah, sure.

890
00:50:13.635 --> 00:50:16.303
Oh, no. Not that kind of proof.

891
00:50:16.336 --> 00:50:18.271
Charlie's an old school Kahuna.

892
00:50:18.305 --> 00:50:20.273
One of the last in the islands.

893
00:50:20.307 --> 00:50:21.475
So, what does he want?

894
00:50:21.508 --> 00:50:26.480
[speaking Hawaiian]

895
00:50:26.513 --> 00:50:28.615
He'd like you to sit
with him for a while.


896
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.718
Cause he has a way
of knowing your truth.


897
00:50:30.752 --> 00:50:33.688
[speaking Hawaiian]

898
00:50:35.455 --> 00:50:36.724
Just the boy.

899
00:50:36.758 --> 00:50:38.458
We can save him a plate.

900
00:51:22.937 --> 00:51:24.739
Do I get to ask
what's in this first?


901
00:51:24.772 --> 00:51:26.206
No.

902
00:51:36.751 --> 00:51:39.721
Ah, something tells me
these aren't portobello.


903
00:51:43.658 --> 00:51:44.892
Cheers.

904
00:52:07.648 --> 00:52:09.717
[coughs]

905
00:52:11.485 --> 00:52:16.490
[Ryan coughing]

906
00:52:16.523 --> 00:52:18.760
[indistinct chattering]

907
00:52:18.793 --> 00:52:20.995
Hey, we got to restock
the whiskey.


908
00:52:28.803 --> 00:52:30.838
[indistinct]

909
00:52:36.409 --> 00:52:37.678
Robbie?

910
00:52:37.712 --> 00:52:39.714
[Robbie grunting]

911
00:52:39.747 --> 00:52:41.048
Robbie!

912
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:50.057
[Ryan coughing]

913
00:52:52.526 --> 00:52:55.797
It's been nice.
I think I'll be going.


914
00:52:57.899 --> 00:53:00.067
[groans, coughs]

915
00:53:00.101 --> 00:53:02.770
Thanks for sharing
your stash and I uh...


916
00:53:02.804 --> 00:53:04.872
and I hope I passed the test.

917
00:53:04.906 --> 00:53:06.373
-No.
-Yeah.


918
00:53:06.406 --> 00:53:09.442
Be still!
Think of your father.


919
00:53:09.476 --> 00:53:13.681
What did he teach you,
to help you become a man.


920
00:53:13.714 --> 00:53:14.949
Not much.

921
00:53:14.982 --> 00:53:16.449
Think of something.

922
00:53:18.485 --> 00:53:20.353
I uh...

923
00:53:24.558 --> 00:53:26.493
He taught me
how to handle a gun.


924
00:53:28.562 --> 00:53:30.397
And after he left home,

925
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:31.666
I swore
I'd never touch one again.


926
00:53:31.699 --> 00:53:33.734
I had to do things my way.

927
00:53:36.971 --> 00:53:38.673
Hey, what more proof
do you need, man?


928
00:53:38.706 --> 00:53:41.075
I can't just sit here.

929
00:53:41.108 --> 00:53:43.110
No more words.

930
00:53:43.144 --> 00:53:46.147
Picture him in your mind,

931
00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.349
then we'll both know
whose son you are.


932
00:54:01.996 --> 00:54:04.832
Go ahead, Ryan.
First, the barrel.


933
00:54:06.634 --> 00:54:08.970
Not that hard, go easy.

934
00:54:11.105 --> 00:54:14.407
I'm not like you!
I don't need to use a gun.


935
00:54:14.441 --> 00:54:16.110
It might save your life one day.

936
00:54:16.143 --> 00:54:18.746
I'm never gonna kill
anyone, ever!


937
00:54:18.779 --> 00:54:20.513
Ryan, pick it up.

938
00:54:20.547 --> 00:54:22.582
Ryan! Ryan!

939
00:54:24.618 --> 00:54:27.088
He is your son.
It's safe to show your face now.


940
00:54:27.121 --> 00:54:28.990
What the hell, Charlie?

941
00:54:29.023 --> 00:54:30.758
I could have told you
that myself.


942
00:54:30.791 --> 00:54:33.094
It's not just your life at risk
if you're found here.


943
00:54:33.127 --> 00:54:34.527
It's the whole settlement.

944
00:54:34.561 --> 00:54:36.030
How strong is this dope?

945
00:54:36.063 --> 00:54:38.199
Because I... um...

946
00:54:38.232 --> 00:54:42.003
It's me, Ryan.

947
00:54:42.036 --> 00:54:44.672
I wouldn't blame you
if you'd rather see me dead.


948
00:54:44.705 --> 00:54:45.873
You're alive?

949
00:54:45.907 --> 00:54:47.174
Yeah.

950
00:54:47.208 --> 00:54:51.979
Took a couple of bullets
but I'm fine.


951
00:54:52.013 --> 00:54:53.546
You listened to my message.

952
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.649
That's a first.

953
00:54:54.682 --> 00:54:55.850
Is that all you can say?

954
00:54:55.883 --> 00:54:57.685
I... I thought you were dead.

955
00:54:57.718 --> 00:54:59.754
I dropped everything.
People tried to kill me.


956
00:54:59.787 --> 00:55:02.455
Easy, kid. Come here.

957
00:55:06.961 --> 00:55:08.528
I'm sorry, Ryan.

958
00:55:16.103 --> 00:55:17.939
Charlie,
what the hell did you do?


959

Your father first came to us

963

to learn about
that evil man, Buck.


964
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.856
So, the enemy of my enemy
is my friend?
That kind of thing.


965
00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:40.628
More than that.
If Mr. Buck wins,
all of Hawaii loses.


966
00:55:40.661 --> 00:55:43.596
We helped Ian that day,
because he was helping us.


967

Oh. Not just us.

969

It was the island herself
that wanted you to win.


970
00:55:56.944 --> 00:56:00.781
The tide dragged him under,
away from his enemies.


971
00:56:00.815 --> 00:56:04.218
And we saw him
and pulled him ashore in time.


972
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:09.123
But what about that body
they showed me at the morgue?


973
00:56:09.156 --> 00:56:12.927
It was a drowning victim,
borrowed from the morgue.


974
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.229
-Sorry.
-Yeah, but why?


975
00:56:15.262 --> 00:56:17.064
I needed Buck to think
I was dead


976
00:56:17.098 --> 00:56:19.166
at least 'till I got back
on my feet.


977
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.168
You said you had evidence
on Terrance.

979
00:56:23.037 --> 00:56:25.206
And his trail led me to Buck.

980
00:56:25.239 --> 00:56:26.974
I had all the proof I needed.

981
00:56:27.008 --> 00:56:29.010
Yeah, whatever you had,
your intel is long gone.


982
00:56:29.043 --> 00:56:30.911
I figured that.

983
00:56:30.945 --> 00:56:32.880
I had a backup
on my cell phone.


984
00:56:32.913 --> 00:56:35.883
That's somewhere
under Honolulu Bay.


985

Well, maybe not.

986

[groans]

988

Now, let me show you a trick
Terrance played on all of us.


989
00:56:48.229 --> 00:56:51.098
I got these from a surgeon
who lost his license,


990
00:56:51.132 --> 00:56:52.867
working for the cartel.

991
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:59.673
Holy shit!
So, Terrance is Buck!


992
00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:01.942
The devil may change his face,

993
00:57:01.976 --> 00:57:04.178
but the spirit of evil
is the same.


994
00:57:04.211 --> 00:57:06.180
So, that day at the cove?

995
00:57:09.984 --> 00:57:13.320
I had Buck in custody
and proof that he was Terrance.


996
00:57:13.354 --> 00:57:15.622
And it all went off the rails.

998

is more than just a land grab


999
00:57:31.672 --> 00:57:33.274
by some dirty politicians?

1000
00:57:33.307 --> 00:57:35.810
I mean,
Buck is a stone-cold killer.


1001
00:57:35.843 --> 00:57:37.610
He's tied to the cartels.

1002
00:57:37.645 --> 00:57:40.047
He'll strip mine the land
and make Maui


1003

You got your boy in office,
Terrance.


1120
01:04:01.195 --> 01:04:03.030
You sure he's gonna play ball?

1121
01:04:03.063 --> 01:04:06.099
He has no choice.
Don't ever call me Terrance.


1122
01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:08.268
He's dead, he's gone.

1123
01:04:08.302 --> 01:04:10.037
I'll call you whatever you like.

1124
01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:11.538
As long as can move
the type of volume


1125
01:04:11.572 --> 01:04:13.273
you're talking about.

1126
01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:15.175
As a matter of fact,

1127
01:04:15.209 --> 01:04:18.412
I feel a little placed out
here myself you know, post op.


1128
01:04:18.445 --> 01:04:20.380
Well, if you're serious
about that,


1129
01:04:20.414 --> 01:04:23.150
you have to acquire a piece
of property that you...


1130
01:04:23.183 --> 01:04:25.018
you might be interested in.

1131
01:04:25.052 --> 01:04:26.553
Everybody, raise your glasses.

1132
01:04:26.587 --> 01:04:28.489
A toast to Senator Kane.

1133
01:04:28.522 --> 01:04:30.023
And the new Maui,

1134
01:04:30.057 --> 01:04:33.193
which I have officially
renamed "Heaven",


1135
01:04:33.227 --> 01:04:37.064
because from now on
everybody's wishes come true.


1136
01:04:37.097 --> 01:04:39.266
Cheers!

1137
01:04:41.201 --> 01:04:43.638
Don't you ever doubt me,
mother fucker.


1138
01:04:51.378 --> 01:04:52.579
Thanks.

1139
01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:59.286
-Hello, car door boy.
-[Ryan chuckles]


1140
01:04:59.319 --> 01:05:00.621
My ears are still ringing
from that time you


1141
01:05:00.655 --> 01:05:02.222
smack me in the head...

1142
01:05:02.256 --> 01:05:03.691
Yeah, as I recall,
you ran into my car,


1143
01:05:03.725 --> 01:05:05.259
not vice versa.

1144
01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:06.527
Yeah.

1145
01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.795
Nice get-up.

1146
01:05:11.164 --> 01:05:13.433
You think this shit
will fool anybody?


1147
01:05:13.467 --> 01:05:15.369
Your about to get your ass
killed in here.


1148
01:05:15.402 --> 01:05:17.639
Now, I thought
they had you locked up.


1149
01:05:17.672 --> 01:05:19.573
Guess they let
all the animals out, huh?


1150
01:05:19.606 --> 01:05:22.609
Buck pulled some strings,
charges were dropped.


1151
01:05:22.644 --> 01:05:25.813
Buck holds more power over
these islands than anyone.


1152
01:05:25.847 --> 01:05:27.715
And with the fall
of Paradise City,


1153
01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:29.583
there's no one left
to keep him in check.


1154
01:05:29.616 --> 01:05:31.451
Am I right?

1155
01:05:31.485 --> 01:05:35.823
Some of the best people
on this island... motherfuckers!


1156
01:05:35.857 --> 01:05:38.091
You don't seem too happy
about your boss's success.


1157
01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.526
He's not my boss!

1158
01:05:41.295 --> 01:05:44.832
I had family in Paliuli, okay?

1159
01:05:44.866 --> 01:05:47.301
He's sure as fuck not my boss.

1160
01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:50.571
You know it was no accident.

1161
01:05:50.604 --> 01:05:53.841
Buck's try to run them
off their homestead.


1162
01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:56.678
If you're here
to give Buck a headache,


1163
01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:58.512
I wouldn't say no
to your helping out.


1164
01:05:58.545 --> 01:06:00.547
And I wouldn't say no
to your help.


1165
01:06:03.851 --> 01:06:08.155
They're holding Robbie Cole
somewhere on this property.


1166
01:06:08.188 --> 01:06:09.556
If Robbie's alive,

1167
01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:11.525
he'll be somewhere
in the underground.


1168
01:06:11.558 --> 01:06:13.560
The word is Buck built tunnels
underneath the property.


1169
01:06:13.594 --> 01:06:15.262
Do you know where?

1170
01:06:15.295 --> 01:06:17.699
I can take a look around.

1171
01:06:17.732 --> 01:06:19.867
I'll get caught
if I'm seen with you.


1172
01:06:22.169 --> 01:06:25.172
Give me a few minutes,
I'll meet you back here.

My God, you think he'll drown?

If we're lucky. Come on.

1191
01:08:42.009 --> 01:08:44.444
I thought you guys were playing
on the down low. Not brawling.


1192
01:08:44.478 --> 01:08:46.446
Your pal Manu didn't give me
much of a choice.

Guys, they know who we are now.

1196
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.889
I have to warn Nikki and
the others they are in danger.


1197
01:08:54.922 --> 01:08:56.556
Meet us on the north end
of the property.


1198
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:58.592
Koa and I will take
a last look for Robbie.


1199
01:08:58.626 --> 01:09:00.895
-Be careful, alright?
-Okay.


1200
01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:03.463
This door leads to a part
of the property they keep
off-limits.


1201
01:09:03.497 --> 01:09:04.665
I've seen Zyatt go
from this door


1202
01:09:04.699 --> 01:09:05.967
and literally disappear
for hours.


1203
01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:10.872
Okay. Hey, hey,
let's try this the easy way.


1204
01:09:13.808 --> 01:09:15.308
Move, haole!

1205
01:09:23.483 --> 01:09:24.752
Hold it!

1206
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.529
What are you waiting for,
Christmas?


1207
01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:37.330
How did you get down here?

1208
01:09:37.364 --> 01:09:38.900
Tunnels under the house.

1209
01:09:38.933 --> 01:09:41.736
Cowards always leave a way out.

1210
01:09:41.769 --> 01:09:43.537
You make a friend?

1211
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:45.673
I'm a friend
of this island, sir.


1212
01:09:45.706 --> 01:09:46.941
I've heard you were too.

1213
01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:50.377
Good for you. Let's move.

1214
01:10:01.388 --> 01:10:03.724
Keep moving. Look at your six.

1215
01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:24.411
Oh, shit.

1216
01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.552
We're too late.

1217
01:10:36.623 --> 01:10:38.759
If you'd shown up
a few hours ago,


1218
01:10:38.793 --> 01:10:40.061
you could have watched him
jump start me


1219
01:10:40.094 --> 01:10:42.797
with that fucking car battery.

1220
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:44.065
You wanna give me
a hand here?


1221
01:10:44.098 --> 01:10:45.800
Oh, I got it, Robbie.

Koa, what are you doing here?

1224
01:10:56.911 --> 01:10:58.746
He's a mutual friend.

1225
01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:02.650
Ian!

1226
01:11:02.683 --> 01:11:05.019
Jesus, you're still alive.

1227
01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:07.688
You too.
Like an old cockroach.


1228
01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.556
Can you still walk?

1229
01:11:09.589 --> 01:11:12.492
I should be asking you
that question, old man.


1230
01:11:12.525 --> 01:11:14.427
I swore the next time
I saw you,


1231
01:11:14.461 --> 01:11:16.563
I'd punch you
in the fucking face.


1232
01:11:16.596 --> 01:11:18.766
Wait, how did you manage
to stay alive down here?


1233
01:11:18.799 --> 01:11:22.435
Told Buck I had proof,
Billford was funding him.


1234
01:11:22.469 --> 01:11:23.838
Took a wild guess.

1235
01:11:23.871 --> 01:11:25.706
You're wrong just like usual.

1236
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.908
Buck is Billford.

1237
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:28.075
What the fuck?

1238
01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:29.677
You're always bullshitting me.

1239
01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:32.479
Shut up, Robbie.
Or I'll tie you back up.


1240
01:11:32.512 --> 01:11:35.082
Will you guys please shut up?

1241

Now, Dad I get it.

1242
01:11:36.817 --> 01:11:38.185
That he hooked up with mom
on Thanksgiving.


1243
01:11:38.219 --> 01:11:40.187
Get over it.

1244
01:11:40.221 --> 01:11:43.556
And you, apologize.

1245
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.458
I have apologized.

1246
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.665
Ian, I'm sorry man.

1247
01:11:50.698 --> 01:11:53.067
I'm fucking sorry, okay?

1248
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.567
I want that in writing.

1249
