00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.410

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550
Oh, good dog.

12
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.480
That's a good boy.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.050

18
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.880
Here you go, boy.

19
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.300
<i>I was a little boy growing up</i>
<i>deep in the Ozark mountains,</i>


20
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.670
<i>with my mom and dad</i>
<i>and my two little sisters,</i>


21
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.240

<i>as far as the eye could see.</i>


22
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.750
<i>My ma was part Cherokee,</i>

23
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.190
<i>and there was a legend in those parts</i>
<i>that a little Indian boy and girl</i>


24
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.350
<i>got lost in a blizzard and died.</i>

25
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.050
<i>When they found them in the spring,</i>

26
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.960
<i>a beautiful red fern</i>

27
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.730

- Howdy.

- What can I do for you?


30
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.220
<i>-</i> You Will Coleman?
- That's right.


31
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.050
Well, this is Hud Bellington,
and I'm Ben Kyle.


32
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.990
Good to meet you.
That's my wife, Jenny.


33
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.490
- Howdy, ma'am.
- Howdy.


34
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.490
And my daughter, Sarah.

35
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.460
Alice, hiding behind the post.
And there's my son, Billy.


36
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.260
We're up from Tulsa.

37
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.270
Oh, really?
We got some kinfolk up there.


38
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.960
We know that. Your uncle Fred's
the one that sent us out here.


39
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.340
Says you got the finest
coon-hunting in the Ozarks.


40
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.310
How about that? You hear that, Jenny?
Uncle Fred sent 'em down here.


41
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.810
How's he doing?

42
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.070
Feed and grain business
doing right good.


43
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.620
Says he wants to sell,
move back East.


44
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.020
Yeah, we heard about that.
We were hoping to...


45
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.820
Hoping to make him an offer sometime.

46
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.690
Boy, that sure would be
a fine thing for a family like yours.


47
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.990
'Course, it'd be mighty tough
giving up country like this, too.


48
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.830
- You'll stay for supper?
- Why, that's mighty kind of you, ma'am.


49
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.030
Well, if we're going
to get any hunting done,


50
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.970
we're going to
have to set up camp before dark.


51
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.230
That is, of course,
if we have your permission.


52
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.640
Oh, that'd be fine.

53
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.770
There's a nice spot
just down the river,


54
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.710
called Dripping Springs.

55
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.570
Well, this road'll take you right to it.

56
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.710
With hounds like these,
you're bound to tree a few.


57
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.750
Well, they're the best
in Mr. Bellington's kennel.


58
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.480
They're sure fine ones, mister.

59
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.920
- They're champions.
- Yep.


60
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.860
Won the coon-hunting competition
three years running.


61
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.260
Is that right?

62
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.560
Hey, you got any hounds
of your own, son?


63
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.430
Well, ain't that a shame?
All this fine hunting...


64
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.990
It's getting late, Kyle.
Maybe we ought to go.


65
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.030
Sure thing, Mr. Bellington.
It's mighty nice meeting you folks.


66
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.300
Yeah, y'all take care, now.

67
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.840
I'm out back, son.

68
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.200
Thank you, Billy.

69
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.380
I was down at Grandpa's
store yesterday, and he said


70
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.850
that old man Stanton's
collie's about to have pups.


71
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.620
- And I'm sure he'd be glad to--
- Pa?


72
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.520
I don't want no collie.

73
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.850
I want hunting dogs.

74
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.920
I know what you want, son.
But hunting dogs cost money.


75
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.090
Right now there's a bluetick pup outside
Grandpa's store. It's going for $35.


76
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.360
Can I go see him?

77
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.840
Did you hear what I said, boy?
I said $35.


78
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.310
Can I at least go look at him?
Please, Poppa?


79
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.070
- Did you finish stacking that cordwood?
- Yes, sir.


80
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.170
Well, I guess it won't hurt nothing.

81
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.580
Be back by noon. You gotta
fix that fence down by the south end.


82
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.980
OK.

83
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.320
<i>Every town has its characters,</i>
<i>and every boy has his nemesis.</i>


84
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.450
<i>Mine was the Pritchards.</i>

85
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.360
<i>We didn't have no train</i>
<i>running through our neck of the woods,</i>


86
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.790
<i>and no train tracks, neither.</i>

87
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.800
<i>But if we did, the Pritchards would</i>
<i>definitely be on the other side of 'em.</i>


88
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.140
I don't know. $35 is a lot
to pay for a dog like that.


89
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.640
- He ain't worth more than 20, Pa.
- Hey, Billy. How you doing?


90
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.940
Not even that much.

91
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:12.750
Well, if you don't like the price, you better
talk to Chet Parker. It's his hound.


92
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.580
I'm just trying to sell it for him.

93
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.120
All right. We'll take it.

94
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.090
It ain't no $35 dog.

95
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.390
But I promised these boys a hound, I'm
gonna get 'em one. Even if it is a poor one.


96
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.270
Now, there's five, 25, 35.

97
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.070
Come on, boys.

98
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.310
I sure seen better dogs in my day.

99
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.410
It'll be hard,
but we'll make something out of him.


100
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.440
Guess it's better than no dog at all.

101
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.520
Well, that's a real shame.

102
00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:02.160
And, sure as I'm living, that's dog's gonna
end up being just as mean as they are.


103
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.260
Bootleg money, that's for sure.

104
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.440
Well...

105
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.170
Oh, Billy.

106
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.230
I wish I could have
bought him for you myself,


107
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.150
but I ain't much
better off than your pa.

108
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.180
Don't you worry, son.

109
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.550
You'll have
your own hound before too long.


110
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.950
I don't know, Grandpa. Sometimes
I think God don't want me to have any.


111
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:31.350
Well, maybe that's 'cause
you ain't doing your fair share.


112
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.400
- What do you mean?
- Ah, Billy.


113
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:40.600
If God was a-minded to get you a dog,
that'd be easy as cutting lard.


114
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.700
But then he'd be doing all the work.
That ain't good for your character.


115
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.140
I don't want character. I want dogs.

116
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.840
I know.

117
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.780
And if you want dogs bad enough,
you're gonna have dogs.


118
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.290
But if you want God's help,
you gotta meet Him halfways.


119
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.020
- What does that mean?
- What, about meeting Him halfways?


120
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.090
Well...

121
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.100

- Thanks.
- Take care, now.


152
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.490
Where in blue blazes
did that come from?


153
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.830
- I saved it.
- You saved it?


154
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.990
So I can buy two hound pups.

155
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.330
Will you order 'em for me?

156
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.500
- How long you been saving up, boy?
- A long time.


157
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.770
I did what you said,
about meeting God halfway.


158
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.680
He's the one that helped me.

159
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.810
- Your pa know you have this?
- Pa needs a new mule real bad.


160
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.410
But I want them dogs real bad, too.

161
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.550
Oh.

162
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.920
Hmm.

163
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.490
You must have worked
real hard for that.


164
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.840
Earned it.

165
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.700
That there is your money.

166
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.400
You want them dogs,
you're gonna get them dogs.


167
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.050
I'll guarantee that.

168
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.830
Billy? You done your schoolwork?

169
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.160
I'm doing it now, Ma.

170
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.980
I want you
to understand something, Billy.


171
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.380
I love this place. It was my mother's land,
and her people before her.


172
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.040
And it'll break my heart to leave,
and it'll break your father's heart as well.


173
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.990
But I know we gotta go to where
my children can get a proper education.


174
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.650
Better than I can give you here.

175
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.220
Now, finish your schoolwork.

176
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.230
Hey, Billy.

177
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.080
- Need some help with that feed?
- No, I got it.


178
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.950
I was just down at Grandpa's store.
He said he's got something for you.


179
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.810
All right, baking powder,

180
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.810
a pound of pork,

181
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.410
- and... Hey, Billy. How you doing?
- Ah, hey, Billy.


182
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.650
Well, I sure thank you,
Miss Carter, and I, uh...


183
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.590
I'm just gonna put this on your bill.

184
00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.250
- Appreciate it.
- OK.


185
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.160
- D.J., here you go.
- Thank you.


186
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.780
Well? Are they here?

187
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.690
What are you talking about?
Is what here?


188
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.060
Oh, you know what?

189
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.800
I think something did come for you...

190
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.860
Oh, I had it on me.
Wait a minute, now. Just...


191
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.500
There it is, yeah. There you go.

192
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.440
What's this?

193
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.140
- Where are they?
- Tahlequah.


194
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.650
- Tahlequah?
- Yes, sir.


195
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.780
Doggone.

196
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.910
That's halfway down the river.

197
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.720
Well, why didn't they come here?

198
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.660
Well, the mail buggy
don't deliver dogs, that's why.


199
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:35.950
Tahlequah?

200
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.720
Well, don't get all upset.
I already talked to Jim Hedges.


201
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.100
He's going over there Saturday,
he'd be happy to give you a ride.


202
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.360
- What if he forgets?
- Well, he ain't gonna forget.


203
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.960
Have a piece of licorice here, and stand
on your head. That'll calm you down.


204
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.970
Oh.

205
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.910
I have something else for you.
It'll make you feel better.


206
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.970
There you go.

207
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.740
- Well, what's this for?
- Well, that's the Depression.


208
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.480
Price is going down on everything,
including hounds. That's your change.


209
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.810
A whole week.

210
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.150
Hey, Billy. You waited this long.
Few more days ain't gonna hurt.


211
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.210
Now, go stand on your head.

212
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.470
Didn't think hunting dogs
was on the schoolwork schedule, Billy.


213
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.710
I'm sorry, Ma.

214
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.610
I just get so excited,
thinking about having my own little pups.


215
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.950
Now, I need you to promise me
that you'll put your schoolwork first


216
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.480
and you put away
this daydreaming about dogs.


217
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.150
I promise.

218
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.560
Cross your heart?

219
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.530
Cross my heart and hope to die.

220
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.100

Morning.

251
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.900
- Morning. I was wondering--
- Kinda warm out there today, isn't it?


252
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.840
- Yes, sir, sure is.
- Might be fixing to rain, though.


253
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.240
We could use some
up where I come from.

254
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.330
Oh, where might that be?

255
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.440
Up the river a ways. About ten,
twelve miles as the crow flies.


256
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.250
You know, I've got a crate back there
making some strange noises,


257
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.510
for a boy who lives up the river.

258
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.020
The name is Billy Coleman.

259
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.680
Yes, sir. That's me.

260
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.820
Come on back here, now. 
I'll show you.

261
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.320
Well, there they are.

262
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.800
What do you think?

263
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.840
Aren't you gonna pick 'em up?

264
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.590
They already know you.

265
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.680
You're gonna need
a gunny sack to carry them in,


266
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.290
and I've cut a couple of slits
in them so that they won't smother.


267
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.920
- Do I owe you anything?
- Oh, no.


268
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.270
There's a small feed bill, but I'll
take care of that. T'ain't much, anyway.


269
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.300
Well, now, ain't that something?

270
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.170
Well, thanks again.

271
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.230
OK.

272
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.050
- Good luck, and good hunting.
- Thanks.


273
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.970
Hey, boy. What's your name?

274
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.970
Billy Coleman.

275
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.700
- How come you ain't wearing no shoes?
- He's one of them hill people.


276
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.330
Think he can feel that?

277
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.470
What you got there?

278
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.010
Don't do that.

279
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.410
I said, don't do that.

280
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.290
So, you want to fight, huh?

281
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.080
Nah. But don't touch my dogs again.

282
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.950
- Beat him up.
- Come on, you can lick him.


283
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.590
He's just a hillbilly.

284
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.060
He's busted my nose!

285
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.720
Grab him.

286
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.040
You're dead meat.

287
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.140
All right, all right.
Break it up. That's it.


288
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.740
- Get up, get up.
- Sheriff.


289
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.110
You boys get on home.
Your parents are going to hear about this.


290
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.710
Go on.

291
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.250
Get!

292
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.120
You all right, son?

293
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.360
My dogs.

294
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.560
Here's your dogs.

295
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.360
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


296
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.630
Come over here and sit down.

297
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.750
Here you go.

298
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.080
There you go.

299
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.150
These are fine-looking dogs.

300
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.850
Where'd you get 'em?

301
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.520
From a dog kennel in Kentucky.

302
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.890
They cost me $40.

303
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.730
You mean to tell me
you paid for 'em yourself?


304
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.270
Yes, sir.

305
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.770
Well, you had to
slop a lot of hogs

306
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.800
and cut a lot of cordwood
to get that kind of money together, son.


307
00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.240
I sure did.

308
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.600
What's your name?

309
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.410
- I'm Billy Coleman.
- I'm Sheriff O'Donnell.


310
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.210
You any kin to Will Coleman
up the river?


311
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.050
Yes, sir. He's my daddy.

312
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.990
That explains a lot.

313
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:20.750
Is there a place nearby
that sells things like overalls?


314
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.760
And candy?
Candy with mushy centers?


315
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.710
One of 'em's calling for you.

316
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.150
You cleaned up good.
Good-looking shoes, mm-mmm.


317
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.810
Listen. Let me buy you a soda pop
before you head for home.


318
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.360
Oh, I ain't never had any before.

319
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.390
Well, for one who's just
starting a soda pop habit,


320
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.920
I would suggest strawberry.

321
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:47.210
<i>Well. that strawberry soda</i>
<i>was about the best thing I'd ever tasted.</i>


322
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:04.130
<i>I couldn't figure out why anyone'd put</i>
<i>these things on their feet on purpose.</i>


323
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:09.220
<i>But I had my pups. and them dogs</i>
<i>was already about to bust my heart in two.</i>


324
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.500
<i>I tried not to think about that black cloud</i>
<i>hanging over me when I got home.</i>


325
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.930
Yaa, yaa!

326
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.000
Dan! Ann! Come here.

327
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.380
Well, I'll be.

328
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.620
- Billy.
- Ma, I--


329
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.460
Don't you say a word, Billy Coleman.
You broke a promise to me.


330
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.050
I had to get my pups, Ma.
They might have died.


331
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.890
You never would have let me go.

332
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.130
<i>Turns out it was</i>
<i>Billy Coleman's lucky day.</i>


333
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.470
This here's little Ann, and that's Dan.

334
00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.200
<i>Just as I'd hoped.</i>
<i>the sight of me all beat up and sore...</i>


335
00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.040
<i>Well, it was too much for her.</i>

336
00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.510
Poppa went over the hill looking for you.
Come on home, now.


337
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.610
- Well, Jenny, will you looky here?
- Are those your dogs, Billy?


338
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.810
Mm-hm.

339
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.850
Did you bring me a treat?

340
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.760
- There you go.
- What about me?


341
00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.880
Thanks, Billy.

342
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.860
Here you are.

343
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.530
- They're sure fine hounds, son.
- I figure they'll do.


344
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.900
Here. This is for you, Pa.

345
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.000
Thank you, son.

346
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.540
This is for you, Momma.

347
00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.770
Let's open these up.

348
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.210
Oh, well, now.

349
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:46.810
Will you looky here? And just in time.
These old ones are barely keeping me in,


350
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.360
and the breeze out.

351
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:50.590
Jenny.

352
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.220
Your momma's
been wanting a new dress.


353
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.320
Looks like there's enough
material there for half a dozen.


354
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.890
You like it, Momma?
The colors are all right?


355
00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.100
It's perfect.

356
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.140
Thank you, Billy.

357
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.370
Yeah, thank you, son.
It's mighty thoughtful of you.


358
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.910
- Tell your pa their names.
- Well,


359
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.710
this one is old Dan,
and this one's little Ann.


360
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.520
I'd say that fits 'em both just fine.
What do you say, Jenny?


361
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.610
I think it's about time
this boy has a decent meal.


362
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.160
Go find Dan.

363
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.640
Over here, Dan.

364
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.650
Come on, old Dan. Get it. Get it.

365
00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.250
All right. Come here, Dan.

366
00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.260
Time for the big test.
You two wait here.


367
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.790
All right, let's go.
Come on. Come on!


368
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.280
Gimme a little more water, son.

369
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.560
Just a little.

370
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.960
That's it.

371
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.830
You know,
Grandpa says in New England


372
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.430
everyone's going crazy
over coonskin coats.


373
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.170
- Is that right?
- So we should be getting a good price.


374
00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.110
Well, I'll tell you what.

375
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:06.380
You can use the side of the smokehouse
wall if you think your hounds can cover it.


376
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.010
It ain't hardly big enough.

377
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.420
It's not, huh?

378
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.760
What are you gonna
do with all that money?


379
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:22.060
Well... you were always saying
how you could use another mule.


380
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.900
Well, you be careful
with this axe, son.


381
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.560
I put a fine edge on that hatchet.

382
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.570
It's for cutting down trees
with coons in, and that's it.


383
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.740
Yes, sir.

384
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.880
Look at them.
They're sure enough ready to go hunting.


385
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.820
Here's a little something
for when you get hungry.


386
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:45.650
Don't worry, Momma. I'll be fine.

387
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.450
Yeah, well, put this on.

388
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.520
I just don't understand why
you have to do your hunting at night.


389
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.190
Well, that's when
ringtails are up and about.


390
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.290
Come on, Billy. 
Better get going.

391
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:00.830
And good luck, son.

392
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.740
I expect to see a big coonskin on
the smokehouse wall in the morning, OK?


393
00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.510
All right. See y'all in the morning.

394
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.700
- Bye, Billy.
- Bye, Billy.


395
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.420
<i>I hope he'll be all right.</i>

396
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.450
Will?

397
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.030
What are we going to do
about Uncle Fred's offer?


398
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.870
Oh, it'll take a miracle to get that
$1000 he's asking us to put down.


399
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.880
I mean, Uncle Fred
wants to go back East by springtime.


400
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.880
Well.

401
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.470
I suppose I can do some patchwork
and mending and such.


402
00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.730
You're working your fingers
to the bone as it is.


403
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:06.330
Pretty as they are. I sure wish
I could have given you an easier life.


404
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.740
You're doing fine.

405
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.610
I just want my children to be able
to go to school so they can read and write.


406
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.010
And go to church.

407
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.310
I'm ashamed of you, little girl.

408
00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:57.120
You let that ringtail fool you like this,
you'll never be a coonhound.


409
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.490
You either, Dan.

410
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.220
You'll never fool them again.
Not never.


411
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:06.180
Doggone.

412
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.920
All right.

413
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.860
Now, I made a
promise and I'll keep it.

414
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.990
We'll get that coon,
whatever it takes.


415
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.630
Yeah.

416
00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.710
<i>Those dogs must have</i>
<i>thought I'd lost my marbles.</i>


417
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.310
<i>Anyone else would have.</i>

418
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:43.620
<i>I didn't know how I was gonna do it.</i>
<i>but a promise is a promise.</i>


419
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.290
Billy. Billy.

420
00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.850
Come on, son.

421
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.090
I couldn't come home.
My dogs put one up a tree.


422
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.570
Oh, that's a big sycamore.

423
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.300
Biggest in the whole river bottom.

424
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:29.400
There ain't no use cutting down
a tree like this just for one coon.


425
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:33.070
- Come on, Billy. Let's go home.
- I can't, Poppa.


426
00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.440
You can't? Why?

427
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.780
I made a bargain with the dogs.

428
00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.840
I told 'em if they
put one up a tree, I'd do the rest.


429
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.050
They done their part.
It's up to me to do mine.


430
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.320
Let me take a look at those hands.

431
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.690
- Does that hurt?
- It's all right.


432
00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.830
You gonna cut down a tree like this,
Billy, you need a man-size axe.


433
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.370
- Here are my gloves.
- Thanks, Pa.


434
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.470
And before you swing that axe,
I want you to eat these eggs.


435
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.640
You can share the biscuits
with the hounds. OK?


436
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.480
All right.

437
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.420
Billy, can you handle this?

438
00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:23.720
Yes, Grandpa.

439
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.560
Well, I guess every boy should have a tree
like this to chop down once in his lifetime.


440
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.290
We're gonna have
enough wood for three seasons.


441
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.840
You take care now, all right?

442
00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.460
I just can't do it, little girl.

443
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.170
My strength's all gone.

444
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.910
Haven't I done my fair share?

445
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.450
Can't you help me a little?

446
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.580
Come on, Ann. Come on, Dan.

447
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:44.520
<i>Ma always regretted the cap</i>
<i>she made me out of that first coonhide.</i>


448
00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:48.260
<i>She said after that</i>
<i>I had raccoon on the brain.</i>


449
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.470
<i>Lucky for me, it turns out</i>
<i>the price we were getting for those skins</i>


450
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.230
<i>was turning what</i>
<i>I loved doing most in the world</i>


451
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.470
<i>into a whole lot
of money for the family.</i>

452
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:04.170
<i>Meanwhile. me and my dogs</i>
<i>were getting known in those parts,</i>


453
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.380
<i>on account of bringing in</i>
<i>the most skins to Grandpa's store.</i>


454
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.420
I tell you, I never seen
anything like it in my life.


455
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:13.050
When that male redbone
grabbed that raccoon by the tail,


456
00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.680
he wasn't anywhere nears a tree.

457
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.250
- Is that right?
- That's right.


458
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:19.780
And last week, we sent
a bundle of furs like you wouldn't believe.


459
00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.030
If they're as good as you say they are, you
ought to enter in that fall competition.


460
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.860
Might have a chance to win,
and find out how good they really are.


461
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.730
Oh, they're good. They're good.

462
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.200
- There's the boy now.
- Hey, Billy. How you doing?


463
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.470
Your grandpa's been
bragging up a storm about you, boy.


464
00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.210
If you and your redbones
is half as good as he says,


465
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.880
I got a pesky ringtail out there been
getting into my chickens, stealing eggs.


466
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.890
- Could use your help one of these nights.
- Just tell me when.


467
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:44.940
Anytime this week.
How's Thursday night?


468
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.790
- That should be all right.
- All right. I gotta get going.


469
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.830
- All right. Take it easy.
- Barley's waiting in the field.


470
00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.450
All righty.

471
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.330
- We'll see you later.
- All right.


472
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.560
Hey.

473
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.930
Where's them hounds
we been hearing so much about?


474
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.160
Back home.

475
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.400
- Ma needs a big sack of cornmeal.
- All righty.


476
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.500
Here you go. And here's the Pritchards'.

477
00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.630
You boys need anything else?

478
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.980
Uh... gimme two plugs of tobacco.

479
00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:15.040
- Little young for that, ain't you?
- It's for my pa.


480
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.810
<i>Is them hounds of yours really as good</i>
<i>as the old man says they are?</i>


481
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.720
My grandpa doesn't lie. Why?

482
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.760
Well, since you're so sure
of yourself, wanna make a bet?


483
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.060
- No.
- What's the matter? You chicken?


484
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.700
No. I just don't wanna.

485
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.000
Billy, get yourself a peppermint there.

486
00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.910
- Sure this is for your pa?
- It's for my pa, all right.


487
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.070
Tobacco...

488
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:45.410
So what--

489
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.710
Now, what do you boys think you're doing?
What do you think you're doing in here?


490
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.650
Get out of my store, right now!

491
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.120
You're gonna have a fine time
explaining this to your pa.


492
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.680
Two plugs of tobacco he never seen.

493
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.490
I better get going.

494
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.960
Remember to tell your folks.
Sunday, supper at my place.


495
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.930
- OK. - OK. - Thanks.
- Take care now.


496
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.590
- See you on Sunday.
- OK.


497
00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.100
Hey, Billy boy.
How you doing, you chicken?


498
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.610
Come on.

499
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.670
Come on, here we go. Come on.

500
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.900
- Come on!
- What's going on out here?


501
00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.610
- Come on.
- Hey, hey!


502
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.910
Can't you Pritchards do
nothing but make trouble?


503
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.750
We ain't looking
to cause trouble. Just bet.


504
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.310
- Bet?
- Bet.


505
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:27.450
- On what?
- Well, we got a ringtail out near our place


506
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.520
that no dog's been
smart enough to tree yet.


507
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.860
Every time they think
they got him treed, he just disappears.


508
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:36.190
Twice as big as you ever saw,
and they call him the ghost coon.


509
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.890
We got $5 says
yours dog can't tree him.

510
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.230
I know my dogs can tree him,
but we don't hold to betting.


511
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.930
Told you he was too chicken.

512
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.370
Wait there, whoa, whoa, hold it.
You say $5?


513
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.410
- $5.
- Just count Billy in on that.


514
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.950
- Grandpa.
- Now, you just take this. OK?


515
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:54.680
Hold onto that. You hold onto
your money, he'll hold onto his money.


516
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:58.280
But Grandpa, you said the Good Book
says a wager's a fool's argument.


517
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.350
The Good Book never had
to deal with no Pritchards.


518
00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.190
This better be on the fair and square,
or I'll be talking to your pa.


519
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.760
Oh, it'll be fair. My pa would
beat us to a pulp if he caught us cheating.


520
00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:13.290
'Bout meeting old Billy and his hounds
in our pasture today? Around sunset.


521
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:15.300
- I'll be there.
- He'll be there.


522
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.740
Don't forget the $5.

523
00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:20.470
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey.


524
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.670
- We're gonna be rich.
- Easiest $5 I'll ever see.


525
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.910
You mean two.
I'm getting three, you know.


526
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.780
It was my idea.

527
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.220
Billy, I have never asked
nothing of no man on earth,


528
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:35.350
but I am asking you
to get that so-called ghost coon.


529
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.260
All right, all right.
Come here. Come here.


530
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:50.430
OK, you two. We gotta find this ghost coon
tonight, and show those Pritchards.


531
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:53.970
Grandpa's counting on us,
you understand?


532
00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.700
All right.

533
00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.870
Come on. Come on.

534
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.640
Come on, little girl.

535
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.320
This'll hold him. We don't want him
fighting with those cooning dogs.


536
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.220
That's them. Come on.

537
00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.600
Attagirl.

538
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.200
They got the scent.

539
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.650
Get him, Dan. Come on, let's go.

540
00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.470
Attagirl. Come on.

541
00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.170
- It's the ghost coon, all right.
- Yep.


542
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:07.840
He always goes this way. Come on.

543
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.050
Hurry up, Rainie. Let's go.

544
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.700
That's him.
He always finds that tree.


545
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:03.900
There's no holes up there or nothing.

546
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:07.070
We've been up there.
He just disappears.


547
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.610
He's gone.

548
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.020
- He's the ghost coon.
- We want our five bucks.


549
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.500
What you doing up there, boy?

550
00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.640
He ain't up there. He's gone.

551
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.990
Come on down here and pay up.

552
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.920
That son of a gun.

553
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.330
You were right.

554
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.430
He's gone. He's disappeared.

555
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.610
He's the ghost coon, all right.

556
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.010
It's old Blue.

557
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.210
Look out, Dan.

558
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:30.480
Hey, get off him.

559
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.930
He's hurt real bad.
I'm gonna get my pa.

Don't go blaming yourself, Billy.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.500
I'm the reason he's dead.

578
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.440
Billy, if anybody's at fault, it's me.

579
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:29.880
- I'm the one who called those boys' bet.
- It's nobody's fault. It was an accident.


580
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:45.520
You can stop worrying, Momma,
'cause I ain't never going hunting again.


581
00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.910
Come on, now, girls.

582
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.540
Hurry up. Grandpa's waiting.

583
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.020
I have an idea, Jenny, this ain't
just a Sunday dinner we're going to.


584
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:14.850
Why? Do you think he's got
something else up his sleeve?


585
00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.020
Knowing your father,
it could be anything,


586
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:21.060
especially where Billy's concerned.

587
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.900
All right, Jenny.

588
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.460
- I know you want some more tater pie.
- Thank you, no.


589
00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:33.170
- Uh, Will? You? How about some?
- No, no. I couldn't.


590
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.940
Girls? Huh?

591
00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:39.070
- No thanks, Grandpa. I'm stuffed.
- I'm full, too.


592
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:42.410
Sarah, did you know
this is your grandma's favorite recipe?


593
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.450
No more, Grandpa.

594
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.780
Now, what are you
trying to do to us, George?


595
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:48.350
I'll just throw it to the critters, then.

596
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.980
All right, Poppa. What is it?

597
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.260
- What's on your mind?
- Mind? I--


598
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:56.130
Well, you must have some purpose
for laying out a feed like this.


599
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.060
No, I just wanted Jenny
to get out of the kitchen


600
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.430
and sample some real cooking here.

601
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.160
Poppa, will you stop your teasing?

602
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.040
You've got something
up your sleeve, and what is it?


603
00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:07.240
I don't. I got nothing
up my sleeve, that's a promise.


604
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:09.240
But, uh...

605
00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:13.750
I do have a little thing here in my pocket
that might be of interest to you.


606
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.610
Billy, why don't you read that out?

607
00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:23.320
"Ozark championship
coon hunt to be held."


608
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.120
There you go.

609
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:26.060
I don't know about y'all,

610
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:30.030
but I've always been interested
in being in a real coon hunt.


611
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.930
Billy, all you have to do is enter old Dan
and little Ann and we're in the contest.


612
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.270
I told you, Grandpa.

613
00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.900
I ain't never going hunting again.

614
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.970
I ain't talking about you entering,
I'm talking about entering the dogs.


615
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.840
Giving them dogs a chance
to prove how good they are.


616
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:47.410
Best in Oklahoma.

617
00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.610
Do you know I made
a record of every coon he treed?


618
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:53.780
I took it over to J.B. Johnson,
down at the courthouse.


619
00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:58.230
He made some kind
of notary's affidavit, or something like that.


620
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:01.060
Turns out there ain't a pair of dogs
in this county can hold a candle to his.


621
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:03.000
- That's enough, now.
- Enough?


622
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:07.830
Well, they're Billy's dogs. He worked
for 'em. It's gotta be his decision.


623
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:15.010
Maybe I will have one more
tiny slice of that tater pie.


624
00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.340
Then I think I need
to get started on cleaning up the dishes.


625
00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:19.780
Oh, no you don't.
That's Alice and me and Sarah.


626
00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:21.580
We're gonna do that, aren't we, girls?

627
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:25.490
- I'll wash, and Sarah can dry.
- Maybe I wanna wash.


628
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.520
Maybe Billy and I can take a look at
the pump and see what's causing that leak.


629
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.750
No, Will. No, no. Relax.
Wilkins are coming Tuesday--


630
00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:32.590
I'll do it.

631
00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:33.690
Hmm?

632
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.820
Grandpa's right.

633
00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.300
Dan and Ann are the best.

634
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.800
They have the right to prove it.

635
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:45.210
Well, I think that settles it.

636
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.470
All right, then.

637
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:13.400
Howdy.

638
00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:20.910
Well, I expected a mess
of people, but nothing like this.


639
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.210
There's those fellers who were
hunting over at our place a while back.


640
00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.110
Mr. Bellington.
He won the competition last year.


641
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:33.850
- He must be here to win again.
- We'll see about that. Right, Billy?


642
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:36.790
- Afternoon, folks.
- Howdy.


643
00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.260
- How you doing?
- Good.


644
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.630
I'm collecting for the pool,
if you're interested. Cash pool.


645
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.130
- Cash pool?
- Uh-huh.


646
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.030
Howdy, Sheriff.

647
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:55.770
Well, if it isn't the boy
who tried to fight every kid in town.


648
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.110
All at the same time.

649
00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.550
Ain't that right?

650
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.880
- Are these the same pups?
- Yes, sir. They sure are.


651
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:05.250
They sure grew into
some fine-looking dogs.


652
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.220
Ah, thank you.

653
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.490
Pa, Grandpa? This is the sheriff
I told you about, from Tahlequah.


654
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.050
Abe O'Donnell.
I'm pleased to meet you at last.


655
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:16.460
Will Coleman.
Thank you for looking after my boy.


656
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.160
George Randall.

657
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:20.570
You said, uh, you said
something about a cash pool?


658
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.730
Oh, yeah. Yeah, each contestant
puts in $5. Make up a cash pool.


659
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.610
Whoever wins, wins it, and the cup.

660
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.110
- $5?
- Now, now wait a minute.


661
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:33.150
I think we'd better
go along with that, there.


662
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.450
That's like finding money.

663
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:39.010
That ought to be $5.
Put it in their name, though, if you will.


664
00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:41.390
- Coleman.
- Coleman.


665
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:16.750
But the point is,
there ain't a pair of hounds out here


666
00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:19.160
that ain't gonna be struggling
to keep up with these two dogs.


667
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:21.560
That's a promise, there.

668
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.070
Let me have your attention
in here, gentlemen.


669
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.370
All right?

670
00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.300
<i>I got a special bulletin.</i>

671
00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:38.340
<i>Carl Brown's dogs have treed the first</i>
<i>coon of this contest, not 20 minutes ago.</i>


672
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.040
And the dogs
are on the trail of another one.


673
00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.520
Hate to tell you this, but old Carl may whip
you before you even get a chance to start.


674
00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:47.680
- Hear that, Grandpa?
- Yeah, I heard it.


675
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.780
They almost have two coons already.

676
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:53.390
Now, don't you start quitting
before you get started here.


677
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:56.800
I don't know. There's some
mighty fine hounds out there.


678
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:59.490
Isn't what they're doing, they're just
stirring 'em up for when you get out there.


679
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:04.200
You're gonna lick 'em, boy.
You're gonna lick 'em good.


680
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:11.740
- Sounds like they're onto one already.
- Yeah.


681
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.340
- Well, howdy, folks.
- Hey, Mr. Kyle.


682
00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.890
- You remember my boy.
- Sure do.


683
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:19.350
Well, say, them your hounds, son?

684
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:24.880
Oh, I figured you'd get you some, but boy,
I didn't think that they'd be such fine ones.


685
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.090
- Uh, what line'd you draw?
- Third.


686
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.690
- Say, you're a little unlucky.
- How come unlucky?


687
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:35.400
Well, our Mr. Bellington
has got his hounds in the best shape ever.


688
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:40.880
<i>There may not be any ringtails left</i>
<i>by the time you boys get out there.</i>


689
00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:44.670
Mr. Bellington better not start shining up
that award before he gets his hands on it,


690
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:45.810
I'll tell you that.

691
00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.440
<i>These two dogs here</i>
<i>are gonna smell out</i>


692
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.880
<i>every coon from here</i>
<i>to Arkansas and back.</i>


693
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:57.220
I'm gonna go get a little shuteye, fellas.
Good luck.


694
00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.590
♪ He was dead

695
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.190
♪ I rammed my finger down his throat

696
00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.230

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:05.830

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.530
♪ Fare thee well, old Joe Clark

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.400
♪ Haven't got long to stay

701
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.250
Them's nothing.

702
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:19.870
- We just got started.
- I can't wait.


703
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:22.140
All right, all right.

704
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.280
Come on, everybody. Come on.

705
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:26.510
The eliminations are over.

706
00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:30.250
Finalists are:
no surprise, Hud Bellington.


707
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:34.290
All right, all right.

708
00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.350
Carl Brown.

709
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:43.530
And our newcomer, 
Billy Coleman.

710
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:51.010
Now, we're gonna start at sundown.

711
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:54.450
And the hounds
that bring in the most coonskins


712
00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:58.010
by sunup tomorrow morning's
gonna win that cup.


713
01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.890
Not to mention that cash pool.

714
01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:10.660
Good luck.

715
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.540
- Well, these hounds are raring to go.
- So am I, Kyle. So am I.


716
01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.400
Get outta there.

717
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:19.700
How you doing, boys?

718
01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.500
- Howdy.
- Hey, how you doing?


719
01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:22.910
Pretty good.

720
01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.500
- Good luck, Mr. Bellington.
- Well, thank you, young man.


721
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.640
Course, I won't be relying on good luck.

722
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.350
I'm gonna be relying on the finest
pair of coonhounds I've ever owned.


723
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.120
Good luck to you. See you.

724
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:38.790
- Let's go feed these guys.
- Sure thing, Hud.


725
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.890
Come on, Billy.
We got a long night.


726
01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:47.300
Let's get some rest.

727
01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.810
<i>-</i> We're in luck.
- How's that, boy?


728
01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.820
You know how coons
like to feed before a coming storm.


729
01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.480
Lots to feed on in them pools.

730
01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.710
- Crawdads and minnows.
- Let's stop here, then.


731
01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.760
- OK.
- Whoa.


732
01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.880
Come on, let's go, Ann. Come on.

733
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.760
OK, little girl.
Get ready to go.


734
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:14.890
- Sounds like they're onto one already.
- Let 'em go, let 'em go.


735
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.260
OK. Go!

736
01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:20.100
<i>-</i> Come on, let's go.
- Yeah!


737
01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:23.970
- Yeah, all right! Come on, let's go.
- Here we go.


738
01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.450
Son, are you ready for number two?

739
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.620
Ready as I'll ever be.

740
01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:46.090
Let's get 'em.

741
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:50.260
<i>-</i> First one. That's the first one.
- Yeah.


742
01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.840
Whoa. Whoa!
Ain't this the Coleman buggy?


743
01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:00.000
How they gonna
make it back to camp?


744
01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:08.240
- How did you and Mr. Bellington do?
- Yeah, we got lucky.


745
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.780
We got three of 'em,
before this blasted storm blew in.


746
01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:14.850
That puts you ahead.
Brad and me got skunks.


747
01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.790
And the Coleman boy?
He still out there?


748
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.990
He hasn't come in yet. If I know
that boy, he ain't got no quit in him.


749
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.550
Billy. Hold up. Hold up, Billy.

750
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:25.990
Son.

751
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:28.730
OK, in a storm like this
the coons'll be heading towards the den.


752
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.330
Hope Dan and Ann
tree 'em before they get there.


753
01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.570
Hope they're about
as hungry and cold as we are.


754
01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:40.240
- I hear 'em.
- Billy! Hold on, Billy.


755
01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.690
Son.

756
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:45.910
Wait a minute.

757
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:47.980
Hold on, boy.

758
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.760
Sounds like they're up ahead.

759
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:01.660
Billy.

760
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.730
Come here!

761
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:28.160
<i>-</i> They got one.
- Hell, would you believe it?


762
01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.560
- All right.
- Yeah.


763
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:32.730
Wait.

764
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.200
- There's two.
- Two?


765
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.210
No. No.

766
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:38.870
- There's three.
- Three coons?


767
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.340
Ain't that something, Grandpa?

768
01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:42.570
Grandpa?

769
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.340
- George?
- Grandpa?


770
01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:47.610
- He was right behind me.
- Grandpa.


771
01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.150
The dogs can find him.

772
01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.590
Son, we better go find your grandpa.
It's getting bad.


773
01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:57.060
The dogs'll stay on that tree
with them coons up there.


774
01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:00.890
Dan, Ann?
You need to understand something.


775
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.590
Grandpa's in trouble,
and we need to help him.


776
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:06.760
Now, you two are the only ones
who can find him in this here storm,


777
01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:08.770
so you have to forget about the hunt...

778
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.830
and winning.

779
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:16.740
Come on, now. Let's go.
Come on, let's go. Come on!


780
01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:28.290
- Come on this way, boy.
- Seems this storm is letting up.


781
01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.090
Pa, they can't find him.

782
01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.530
Here, smell for Grandpa. Here, smell
for Grandpa. Smell for Grandpa.


783
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.030
Smell. Smell.

784
01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.090
They lost him.

785
01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.000
Oh, they're onto another coon, now.

786
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:54.710
They got something.

787
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.770
Go get Billy. Go on.

788
01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:04.750
That's them. They found him.

789
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.590
- George.
- Grandpa.


790
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.300
Grandpa.
Grandpa, are you all right?


791
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.600
- I'm all right, boy.
- Where you hurt?


792
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:21.770
It's the leg. I think it broke.

793
01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.410
OK. Billy, I need...
I need a fair-sized branch, OK?


794
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.570
Is he gonna be all right?

795
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:29.080
- OK.
- He's gonna be fine.


796
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:32.920
I'm gonna go for help.
It's starting to let up.


797
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:39.480
OK. Sorry, Grandpa. I'm sorry.

798
01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.020
- We didn't get those coons, though.
- Aw...


799
01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:46.560
- We got Grandpa, though.
- You got no coons?


800
01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.080
Hey, Billy. They're about to give
that trophy away. Ain't you gonna come?


801
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:03.140
I'd rather not, Pa.

802
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:07.310
Well, if that's the way you feel,
I ain't gonna tell you otherwise.


803
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:10.720
You're a good man.
You proved it again last night.


804
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:13.520
Yeah.

805
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.500
Hey, George.
Better late than never.


806
01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:28.410
You know, I think he broke this leg
just to get some attention, don't you?


807
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.670
I bet I could still
beat you in a footrace, Sheriff.


808
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.910
Bet you can.

809
01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:36.920
I think it's safe to say this is
the most exciting hunt I've ever been on.


810
01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.250
I'll say amen to that.

811
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.420
All right, everybody. Now we come
to the moment we've all been waiting for.


812
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:45.720
Presentation of this beautiful cup.

813
01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:49.700
I don't think anybody's gonna be
surprised when I call the winner up here,


814
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.830
'cause this is the fourth year
in a row for this fella.


815
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:59.670
I declare the winner of the 20th
Annual Coonhound Championship


816
01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:02.470
to be Hud Bellington.

817
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:09.210
Here you go, sir.
Congratulations.


818
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.620
Thank you, Sheriff.

819
01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.960
Thank you, young man. That was
a sportsman-like thing for you to do.


820
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.300
I know how you felt
about winning this cup,


821
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:29.270
'cause I know how you feel
about your dogs,


822
01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.860
and for good reason.

823
01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:34.270
Now, about this trophy.

824
01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.310
To be truthful, folks,
I didn't sleep real good last night.


825
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.640
And the reason
I didn't sleep real good is 'cause


826
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:42.710
I knew that young Coleman's
dogs here treed three coons,


827
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.910
in addition to the one earlier,

828
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:49.320
which would've given him
four to my dogs' three.


829
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:53.190
I also know that
he called his dogs off them coons


830
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.660
and abandoned them there
to go find his grandpa.


831
01:07:56.730 --> 01:07:58.290
Now, I know the rul ebook states

832
01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:00.960
that you're supposed to
present the skins to the judges.


833
01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.230
But, in all honesty,

834
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.400
I don't want my dogs winning
a championship that wasn't theirs clear.


835
01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:13.540
So I hereby declare
Billy Coleman and his fine redbones


836
01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:17.950
champions and winners
of this beautiful trophy.


837
01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:21.780
Come on up here, son.

838
01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:28.350
There you go.

839
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:31.490
Take it, son.
You won it fair and square.


840
01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:34.730
But you better be ready to give it back
next year, 'cause me and my Walkers


841
01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.240
are gonna beat the britches
off you and these redbones here.


842
01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:43.270
Folks. Folks.

843
01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.400
Folks.

844
01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.680
I don't know how you feel right now,
but from where I'm standing, I...


845
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:55.250
I think Mr. Bellington deserves
a real Oklahoma hand for this here.


846
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.890
Uh... how about this cash pool?

847
01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:06.900
Well, I reckon he won that
fair and square too, Sheriff.


848
01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.700
Whoo! Yes, all right.

849
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:46.410
Billy. Where's your father?

850
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:50.810
Grandpa hurt his leg a bit.
Pa's fixing him up. He'll be here soon.


851
01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.810
What happened?

852
01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.120
He just had a little fall.
Pa says he'll be all right.


853
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.920
What is it, Billy?

854
01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.430
We won.

855
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.590
- You what?
- We won.


856
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:14.070
Little Dan and Ann and me,
we won first prize.


857
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:18.130
Here. This is for you, Ma.

858
01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:21.330
We won the best-looking dogs prize, too.

859
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:23.970
Or at least, little Ann did.

860
01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:27.210
So we can move to Tulsa.

861
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.770
So you can have your dream, too.

862
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.150
What about you and your dogs, Billy?

863
01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:41.360
We'll be all right.
They can chase cars and squirrels.


864
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.630
<i>I knew our days</i>
<i>on the farm were numbered.</i>


865
01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:22.000
<i>so me and my dogs took to the woods</i>
<i>whenever my schoolwork was done.</i>


866
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:30.570
<i>It was like we were</i>
<i>drinking up the moonlight while we could,</i>


867
01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.240
<i>and we couldn't get enough of it.</i>

868
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.580
Ann, get back. Get back.

869
01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.700
Dan!

870
01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.080
Ann!

871
01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.110
Yaa, yaa!

872
01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.790
Ann, come back.

873
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.770
Stay, Dan. Stay.

874
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:20.750
Dan.

875
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.520
It's OK, Dan.

876
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:31.570
It's all right.

877
01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.070
Good girl. Good girl.

878
01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:51.140
It's all right.

879
01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:43.470
<i>In the days that followed.</i>
<i>we all grieved for old Dan.</i>


880
01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:47.700
<i>It was hard to know</i>
<i>whose heart was broke the most.</i>


881
01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.680
Pa, I'm gonna go check on little Ann.

882
01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:03.920
What's wrong, little girl?

883
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:06.430
You have to eat something.

884
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:10.020
Please?

885
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:24.070
<i>Sometimes you just know</i>
<i>what's gonna happen.</i>


886
01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:28.280
<i>even if you won't listen</i>
<i>to the voice that tells you so.</i>


887
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:32.080
<i>And as sure as I knew that winter was</i>
<i>coming and we were moving to Tulsa.</i>


888
01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:37.390
<i>I knew little Ann's heart was broke. and</i>
<i>she didn't want to live without old Dan.</i>


889
01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.520
<i>But I wasn't gonna admit it,</i>

890
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:42.500
<i>and I wasn't gonna</i>
<i>let her go without a fight.</i>


891
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.190
Little Ann.

892
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:48.360
Little Ann.

893
01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:53.440
Ann.

894
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:55.570
Little Ann.

895
01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.910
Where is she?

896
01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.040
She ain't in the barn, son.
Have you checked in the house?


897
01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:01.450
I looked there already.

898
01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.750
I don't understand.

899
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:43.160
I prayed for both of my dogs.

900
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.390
And now they're both dead.

901
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.790
Your momma said
some prayers, too, Billy,


902
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:56.300
and 'cause of your dogs
those prayers were answered.


903
01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:01.970
I need to get started.
Little Ann deserves a proper burial box.


904
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.520
Momma?

905
01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:25.190
Do you think God
made a heaven for dogs?


906
01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:28.900
I'm sure He did, Billy.

907
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.140
I'm sure He did.

908
01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.220
If we want to get to Wagoner
by night, we better get going.


909
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:49.880
We're just about ready.

910
01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.220
- You're supposed to sit in the back.
- Uh-uh.


911
01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:53.850
I don't want to hear
any more out of either of you now.


912
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:56.950
I want you to just sit where
I told you. Here, hold that.


913
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:59.090
I want to hold Momma's hat.

914
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.600
I want to hold Momma's hat.

915
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.430
That's everything, Pa.

916
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:07.700
Can I go down the river
just one more time?


917
01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:10.110
All right, son.

918
01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:14.540
Don't linger.

919
01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.630
Momma, Poppa.

920
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.140
Come here, hurry.

921
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.250
Ain't that something?

922
01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.460
It's a red fern.

923
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:08.260
It's beautiful.

924
01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.830
Maybe the Lord's
trying to tell you something, Billy.


925
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:19.440
<i>They say only an angel</i>
<i>can plant those seeds.</i>


926
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:23.080
<i>and whenever that happened</i>
<i>those ferns never died,</i>


927
01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:25.850

928

930

931

932
01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:52.570

933
01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:57.780
