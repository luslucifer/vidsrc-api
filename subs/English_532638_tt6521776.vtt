12
00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:18.587
Shot that one myself.

13
00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:21.389
Really?

14
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:24.826
He was a tough old
son of a bitch.


15
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.528
Shot him nine times.

16
00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:28.930
But I got him.

17
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.433
Are you all finished?

18
00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:33.702
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:35.236
Ah, you can call me Ed.

20
00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:37.438
Follow me.

21
00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:44.245
You ever work at a
gas station before?


22
00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:45.513
No.

23
00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:46.915
You own your own car?

24
00:02:48.784 --> 00:02:49.885
Uh, not yet.

25
00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.623
But my friend can drive me
here, and I can get the bus.


26
00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:55.489
Okay.

27
00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:03.765
Well, what we're
looking for is someone


28
00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.966
to work the night shift.

29
00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:08.603
From ten to six in the morning.

30
00:03:08.937 --> 00:03:09.971
Just to let you know,

31
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.774
we don't get a lot of
business during the night.


32
00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:15.811
You will get some hunters
and farmers rolling


33
00:03:15.844 --> 00:03:17.646
in around four or five.

34
00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:19.848
These hours work for you?

35
00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:22.918
Yeah, I can work
whenever you want.


36
00:03:26.888 --> 00:03:29.490
I wish you had a
little more experience.


37
00:03:29.524 --> 00:03:31.760
I'm a really fast learner.

38
00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:33.294
And a hard worker.

39
00:03:36.865 --> 00:03:38.967
So, you were
convicted of a felony.


40
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.771
Yeah.

41
00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:45.306
Did you go to prison?

42
00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:49.811
For a little while.

43
00:03:52.313 --> 00:03:52.848
For what?

44
00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:02.858
I set my boyfriend on fire.

45
00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.000
Did he deserve it?

46
00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:16.972
Yeah.

47
00:04:18.472 --> 00:04:19.608
When did you get out?

48
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:21.375
Two weeks ago.

49
00:04:22.744 --> 00:04:24.913
My parole officer told
me about this place.


50
00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:26.882
So you have a parole officer?

51
00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:28.016
Tom Doogan.

52
00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:31.586
He's the one told
me about this job.


53
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.888
I know Tom.

54
00:04:33.922 --> 00:04:34.956
I...

55
00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:41.630
I really need this job.

56
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.399
Well, I had an
interview this morning.


57
00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:47.869
And to be honest, I
didn't like him too much.


58
00:04:47.903 --> 00:04:49.938
He reminded me of my
daughter's husband,


59
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:51.840
and he's an asshole.

60
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.044
I go a lot on my gut feelings.

61
00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:00.514
You promise you won't
give me any shit?


62
00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:01.850
Yeah, I promise.

63
00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:04.786
All right.

64
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.954
You got the job.

65
00:05:08.857 --> 00:05:09.858
Thank you.

66
00:05:11.827 --> 00:05:15.362
I've just been, I've looking
for a job since I got out.


67
00:05:15.396 --> 00:05:18.099
So, this is really great.

68
00:05:19.034 --> 00:05:20.902
You won't regret it.

69
00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:22.403
Can you start tonight?

70
00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:24.005
Yeah, absolutely.

71
00:05:24.973 --> 00:05:27.943
Do you have a number
I can reach you at?


72
00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:31.646
No, I don't have a
cell phone right now.


73
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.747
Home phone?

74
00:05:33.982 --> 00:05:36.651
Get here around 9:30.

75
00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:38.086
Bobby will give
you the walk-through


76
00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:40.421
and show you how to
run the register.


77
00:05:42.023 --> 00:05:42.858
Okay.

78
00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:46.161
It's good meeting you, Mary.

79
00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:47.796
And good luck.

80
00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:48.964
Thanks.

81
00:05:50.098 --> 00:05:52.601
Tell Tom he
owes me a six pack.


82
00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:05.981
So?

83
00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:08.449
I got it.

84
00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:11.086
Oh my God, Mary!

85
00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:12.486
Congratulations.

86
00:06:13.154 --> 00:06:14.890
It doesn't pay very very will.

87
00:06:14.923 --> 00:06:16.992
And I'll have to work
the graveyard shift.


88
00:06:17.025 --> 00:06:19.995
But, I'll take what I
can get, right?


89
00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:20.896
Absolutely.

90
00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:21.930
You need a job.

91
00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:23.798
It's a great first step.

92
00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:25.934
So, when do you start?

93
00:06:26.134 --> 00:06:27.636
Tonight.

94
00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.436
Wow, that was fast.

95
00:06:30.705 --> 00:06:31.773
Yeah.

96
00:06:31.806 --> 00:06:34.175
I'm going to take you to
lunch today to celebrate.


97
00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:35.043
What are your plans?

98
00:06:35.476 --> 00:06:38.079
Uh, I need to meet my
parole officer at 11.


99
00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:40.982
Let's meet at Canton
Square at like, 12:30?


100
00:06:41.515 --> 00:06:42.483
Okay.

101
00:06:42.717 --> 00:06:45.086
I think this is the
start of a new life.


102
00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.113
12:30.

103
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:46.982
I'll see you then.

104
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.558
Stop!

105
00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:33.061
Oh my God.

106
00:08:34.162 --> 00:08:37.298
I did it all for you, Mary.

00:09:02.724 --> 00:09:04.192
I know you like to watch.

113
00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:05.060
No.

114
00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:12.100
You're not real.

115
00:09:17.205 --> 00:09:18.640
You're not real.

116
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.175

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.338
Hey, are you okay?

120
00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:52.841
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:09:52.874 --> 00:09:53.708
I'm fine.

122
00:09:56.878 --> 00:09:58.379
Why, why didn't you knock?

123
00:09:58.413 --> 00:10:00.315
You can't just walk
into people's apartments.


124
00:10:01.983 --> 00:10:02.750
The door was open.

125
00:10:03.818 --> 00:10:05.286
Is it 11 o'clock already?

126
00:10:05.554 --> 00:10:06.387
Yeah.

127
00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:09.691
Who's in the bathroom?

128
00:10:11.392 --> 00:10:12.293
Nobody.

129
00:10:28.343 --> 00:10:30.712
Who were you talking to?

130
00:10:31.412 --> 00:10:32.847
I wasn't taking to anybody.

131
00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:53.868
I tried calling you.

132
00:10:53.902 --> 00:10:54.869
What's wrong with your phone?

133
00:10:57.472 --> 00:10:59.107
It's not plugged in.

134
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.108
Why?

135
00:11:00.808 --> 00:11:02.243
Because I don't want a phone.

136
00:11:02.277 --> 00:11:03.978
Plug your phone in.

137
00:11:04.946 --> 00:11:06.981
This isn't a request.

138
00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:08.249
If I can't get hold of
you things are going


139
00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:09.384
to get very difficult.

140
00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:14.923
Listen, I know all about
you and your boyfriend.


141
00:11:14.956 --> 00:11:16.024
I'm sure you're going
to carrying that


142
00:11:16.057 --> 00:11:17.258
around with you your whole life.

143
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.230
But you have a chance now to
do something with yourself.


144
00:11:23.264 --> 00:11:25.166
So don't fuck it up.

145
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.302
I'm not crazy, you know.

146
00:11:27.335 --> 00:11:30.305
The file says paranoid
and delusional,


147
00:11:30.338 --> 00:11:32.273
who suffers from hallucinations.

148
00:11:34.876 --> 00:11:36.311
You know, I didn't do anything.

149
00:11:36.344 --> 00:11:38.479
Then why are you here?

150
00:11:38.513 --> 00:11:41.316
You need to save the denial
speeches for someone who cares.


151
00:11:45.386 --> 00:11:47.288
I got a job.

152
00:11:47.322 --> 00:11:48.356
Good for you.

153
00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:51.326
Where?

154
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.328
Deer Gas Market.

155
00:11:54.195 --> 00:11:55.430
I see.

156
00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:57.232
You took my advice.

157
00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:00.101
Ed says you owe him a six pack.

158
00:12:00.134 --> 00:12:03.404
Yeah, I owe that old bastard
more than a six pack.


159
00:12:03.438 --> 00:12:05.106
When do you start?

160
00:12:06.007 --> 00:12:06.808
Tonight.

161
00:12:07.508 --> 00:12:09.444
Well that's good.

162
00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:10.278
Thanks.

163
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.281
I'll check in with you tonight.

164
00:12:24.192 --> 00:12:26.562
Just to fill you in
on a little secret.


165
00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:28.496
There were a lot of people
didn't want you released.


166
00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:31.499
They think you're
still highly unstable.


167
00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:34.836
A lot of families and
officials want you to fail.


168
00:12:34.869 --> 00:12:36.404
They'd like nothing
better than for you


169
00:12:36.437 --> 00:12:37.805
to do something stupid.

170
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:40.375
So they can use it
against you, lock you up


171
00:12:40.408 --> 00:12:41.509
and throw away the key.

172
00:12:43.144 --> 00:12:44.946
Just like your boyfriend.

173
00:12:44.979 --> 00:12:47.815
And guess who's their only
source of information?


174
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.818
- You.
- That's right.


175
00:12:50.852 --> 00:12:54.289
So walk the line, report
back to me everyday,


176
00:12:54.322 --> 00:12:57.292
and I'll make sure
you stay out of jail.


177
00:12:57.325 --> 00:12:58.192
Is that understood?

178
00:13:00.428 --> 00:13:01.963
I thought you didn't care.

179
00:13:01.996 --> 00:13:02.830
I don't.

180
00:14:21.442 --> 00:14:22.544
Hey.

181
00:14:22.578 --> 00:14:24.045
Are you okay?

182
00:14:26.047 --> 00:14:27.248
Yeah.

183
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:28.550
What were you looking at?

184
00:14:28.584 --> 00:14:29.585
Oh, nothing.

185
00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:32.186
I just thought I saw someone.

186
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.954
Who?

187
00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:34.389
Nobody.

188
00:14:34.422 --> 00:14:35.123
Are you ready?

189
00:14:35.156 --> 00:14:36.157
Yeah.

190
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.593
You want to go to
Harmond's or the Mayflower?


191
00:14:38.426 --> 00:14:39.227
Mayflower is fine.

192
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.340
♪ Make up my mind ♪

193
00:14:52.373 --> 00:14:54.942
So come on, tell
me more about this job.


194
00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:57.111
What do you want to know?

195
00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:00.348
What did the owner say?

196
00:15:01.349 --> 00:15:03.585
He wished I had more experience.

197
00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:05.086
It's a gas station.

198
00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:06.988
It's not like it's
rocket surgery.


199
00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:10.391
Yeah but, I've never worked
in a gas station before.


200
00:15:10.425 --> 00:15:11.993
Well, my cousin does.

201
00:15:12.026 --> 00:15:13.394
And he's a fucking idiot.

202
00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:15.329
So you'll be just fine.

203
00:15:16.598 --> 00:15:18.600
I can't eat, I'm so nervous.

204
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.636
What the Hell are
you nervous about?


205
00:15:22.638 --> 00:15:23.938
I don't know.

206
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.074
Well, if you're not going
to eat it, can I have it?


207
00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:29.243
Sure.

208
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.953
Remember outside when you
asked what I was looking at?


209
00:15:40.556 --> 00:15:41.557
Yeah.

210
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.292
Someone was staring at me.

211
00:15:44.325 --> 00:15:44.992
Who?

212
00:15:45.594 --> 00:15:47.629
He looked like James.

213
00:15:47.663 --> 00:15:49.430
James is in jail.

214
00:15:51.098 --> 00:15:52.366
Yeah, I know.

215
00:15:54.402 --> 00:15:57.539
And, even if by some
miracle he got out,


216
00:15:57.573 --> 00:15:59.507
I doubt he could even walk.

217
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:00.776
You burnt the guy to a crisp.

218
00:16:14.455 --> 00:16:16.692
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

219
00:16:18.493 --> 00:16:20.294
Uh, yeah.

220
00:16:22.363 --> 00:16:24.065
Are you taking your medicine?

221
00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:26.602
Yeah.

222
00:16:27.669 --> 00:16:30.137
Yeah... but?

223
00:16:31.072 --> 00:16:33.241
I'm still having those
episodes every now and again.


224
00:16:34.843 --> 00:16:35.677
Jesus.

225
00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:40.549
Don't tell your parole officer
or your doctor any of this.


226
00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:42.083
I won't.

227
00:16:42.116 --> 00:16:43.619
They'll throw your
ass away for life.


228
00:16:45.687 --> 00:16:47.388
Do you think I'm
going to be alright?


229
00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:53.562
Listen, you've been
through a lot of shit.


230
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:56.665
I can't even imagine
what it was like.


231
00:16:56.698 --> 00:17:00.067
But you can't keep
living in the past.


232
00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:02.571
You did your time.

233
00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:04.606
And what's done is done.

234
00:17:05.874 --> 00:17:07.543
You have to move on.

235
00:17:08.677 --> 00:17:09.510
Yeah.

236
00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:12.380
You're right.

237
00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:16.585
Everything's gonna be great.

238
00:17:17.653 --> 00:17:18.185
Come on.

239
00:17:18.219 --> 00:17:19.220
Let's get out of here.

240
00:17:56.825 --> 00:17:57.726
Hello?

241
00:17:57.759 --> 00:18:01.830
I'm glad you
plugged your phone in.


242
00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.431
I told you I would.

243
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:05.466
Good job, Mary.

244
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:07.636
I hope your job goes well.

245
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:08.870
Thanks.

246

00:20:08.724 --> 00:20:09.858
Well...

272
00:20:11.358 --> 00:20:14.029
James would call
me every time it rained


273
00:20:14.062 --> 00:20:18.466
and play that song
over the phone.


274
00:20:22.403 --> 00:20:24.940
That's how I knew he was
going to kill someone.


275
00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:29.410
God, that's so fucked up.

276
00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:35.917
Is that why you
don't want a phone?


277
00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:40.387
One of the many reasons.

278
00:20:43.892 --> 00:20:48.496
You know, you're the only
one who has stuck by me.


279
00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:51.700
I never would have been able

280
00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:54.002
to do any of this without you.

281
00:20:56.337 --> 00:20:57.471
So, thank you.

282
00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:01.810
You don't have to thank me.

283
00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:03.511
We've been friends
since we were five.


284
00:21:03.545 --> 00:21:05.046
You're like family to me.

285
00:21:07.348 --> 00:21:09.885
I'll never turn my back on you.

286
00:21:10.719 --> 00:21:13.387
I know what everyone
says about me.


287
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.056
Yeah, well you know
what I say to them?


288
00:21:15.991 --> 00:21:16.825
What?

289
00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:17.926
Go fuck yourself.

290
00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:44.853
Are you sure you
want to work here?


291
00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:49.991
I don't really have a choice.

292
00:21:52.527 --> 00:21:54.763
This place is in the
middle of nowhere.


293
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.866
I don't like you being
out here all by yourself.


294
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.467
I'll be fine.

295
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.705
What are you doing?

296
00:22:03.972 --> 00:22:05.006
I'm coming in.

297
00:22:05.472 --> 00:22:07.843
I need to see what this shithole
looks like on the inside.


298
00:22:25.026 --> 00:22:25.760
Hi.

299
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:26.928
Can I help you?

300
00:22:26.962 --> 00:22:27.863
I'm Mary.

301
00:22:29.931 --> 00:22:31.867
I'm supposed to
start work tonight.


302
00:22:33.034 --> 00:22:34.035
Oh, right.

303
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.470
Hi, I'm Bobby.

304
00:22:36.503 --> 00:22:38.073
- Hi.
- Hi.


305
00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:39.406
And this is Deb.

306
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.407
Oh, hi.

307
00:22:40.441 --> 00:22:41.109
Do you sell beer?

308
00:22:41.142 --> 00:22:42.077
Oh yeah.

309
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.844
It's right in the back.

310
00:22:45.747 --> 00:22:47.883
So, Ed says this
is your first time


311
00:22:47.916 --> 00:22:49.516
working in a gas station?

312
00:22:49.985 --> 00:22:50.652
Yeah.

313
00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:52.587
Okay. Well, it's
pretty easy.


314
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:54.789
So, you don't have to
worry about a thing.


315
00:22:55.757 --> 00:22:58.026
Do you want to see what's
going on back here.


316
00:22:58.059 --> 00:22:59.527
Yeah.

317
00:23:00.528 --> 00:23:02.797
So this is the cash register.

318
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:05.033
And this is the scanner.

319
00:23:05.066 --> 00:23:06.935
You just scan the item.

320
00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:08.870
Press this button
and this button.


321
00:23:08.904 --> 00:23:10.572
And when people pay
for gas they have


322
00:23:10.605 --> 00:23:12.040
to come inside because
the pumps are old


323
00:23:12.073 --> 00:23:13.074
and they're not automated.

324
00:23:15.043 --> 00:23:16.611
I'll take a pack of Spirits.

325
00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:17.979
Okay.

326
00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:21.116
Just make sure that you card

327
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:23.051
because I got in
trouble once for selling


328
00:23:23.084 --> 00:23:24.052
to a 12-year-old.

329
00:23:24.819 --> 00:23:26.988
You sold cigarettes
to 12-year-old?


330
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:29.591
She had boobs.

331
00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:31.726
So, it was confusing.

332
00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:34.495
Uh...

333
00:23:34.529 --> 00:23:36.798
Yeah, so you want
to ring her up?


334
00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:39.167
Uh... uh sure.

335
00:23:39.433 --> 00:23:40.635
All right.

336
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.471
And, is that
debit or credit?


337
00:23:44.706 --> 00:23:46.007
Uh, is that debit or credit?

338
00:23:46.708 --> 00:23:48.176
- Debit.
- Okay.


339
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.113
That will be $9.75, please.

340
00:23:59.921 --> 00:24:00.922
See?

341
00:24:00.956 --> 00:24:02.057
Easy as that.

342
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.824
Good job!

343
00:24:03.024 --> 00:24:04.726
- Thanks.
- All right.


344
00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:06.995
Okay, so I'll get
you a set of keys


345
00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:08.263
and I'll show you around
the rest of the store.


346
00:24:08.296 --> 00:24:09.731
- Okay.
- All right.


347
00:24:15.303 --> 00:24:17.005
He's kind of cute.

348
00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:18.740
For a guy that works
at a gas station.


349
00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:23.244
So, are you going to
stay here all night?


350
00:24:23.278 --> 00:24:25.280
No, I'm leaving.

351
00:24:25.313 --> 00:24:27.816
I just wanted to make sure
everything was all right.


352
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.218
Everything's fine.

353
00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:33.521
I'll call and check
up on you later.


354
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:34.189
Okay.

355
00:24:36.658 --> 00:24:38.593
And don't get too drunk.

356
00:24:38.626 --> 00:24:40.161
You have to pick me up at six.

357
00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:41.997
When have I <i>ever</i>
gotten too drunk?


358
00:24:55.877 --> 00:24:56.745
Ok.

359
00:25:26.141 --> 00:25:27.275
Fuck!

360
00:25:52.267 --> 00:25:53.935
We only have five channels.

361
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.237
That's fine.

362
00:25:56.271 --> 00:25:58.039
I'm not going to be watching
that much television.


363
00:25:58.473 --> 00:25:59.474
You say that now,

364
00:25:59.507 --> 00:26:01.209
but by three a.m., you're
going to be begging


365
00:26:01.242 --> 00:26:04.212
for some crappy
TV show to watch.


366
00:26:04.913 --> 00:26:05.747
Trust me.

367
00:26:06.881 --> 00:26:08.083
Okay.

368
00:26:08.116 --> 00:26:10.151
Here are the keys to this store.

369
00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:13.321
This round one opens
the front door, okay?


370
00:26:13.354 --> 00:26:15.190
So if you leave the market,
you're going to have to


371
00:26:15.223 --> 00:26:17.058
use this to lock the
door behind you.


372
00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:21.262
This thin one opens the back
door and the bathroom door,


373
00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:24.032
and Ed likes to keep that
door locked at all times.


374
00:26:24.065 --> 00:26:24.833
Okay?

375
00:26:25.233 --> 00:26:27.235
And what's that one for?

376
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:29.003
What do you think it's for?

377
00:26:30.105 --> 00:26:31.106
Outdoor bathroom?

378
00:26:33.308 --> 00:26:34.676
You are a fast learner.

379
00:26:36.344 --> 00:26:38.680
Alright, I think
that's pretty good.


380
00:26:39.414 --> 00:26:41.916
Uh, I think you're ready
for your first night.


381
00:26:43.251 --> 00:26:45.153
Uh, it should be a slow one.

382
00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:46.788
Monday's are always slow.

383
00:26:47.755 --> 00:26:48.923
Mmmm.

384
00:26:54.629 --> 00:26:57.365
Just call me if you
have any problems.


385
00:26:57.398 --> 00:26:58.366
Okay?

386
00:26:58.399 --> 00:27:02.370
Ed wants me to check in
on you later on tonight,


387
00:27:02.403 --> 00:27:04.205
to see if everything's okay.

388
00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:05.039
Okay.

389
00:27:05.073 --> 00:27:07.208
Got anymore questions
before I go?


390
00:27:07.242 --> 00:27:08.243
Uh...

391
00:27:09.978 --> 00:27:11.746
has this place
ever been robbed?


392
00:27:13.314 --> 00:27:15.416
Uh, well...

393
00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:17.252
I mean...

394
00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:22.423
only by me.

395
00:27:24.058 --> 00:27:26.127
Now, you can eat and
drink anything you want.


396
00:27:26.494 --> 00:27:28.997
Just keep your hands off,
these babies are mine,


397
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.198
and I have seniority.

398
00:27:30.498 --> 00:27:31.933
I'm okay, thanks.

399
00:27:33.034 --> 00:27:34.169
Ed never notices.

400
00:27:34.202 --> 00:27:35.737
Leave it in the
dumpster out back.


401
00:27:38.273 --> 00:27:40.175
Uh, and if you smoke,
do it outside.


402
00:27:41.342 --> 00:27:42.177
Okay.

403
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.181
Well, I guess that's it.

404
00:27:46.714 --> 00:27:48.316
I'll see you later, Mary.

405
00:27:48.651 --> 00:27:49.717
See ya.

406
00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:55.256
I hate the rain.

407
00:28:46.274 --> 00:28:47.508
Ew, gross.

408
00:29:23.444 --> 00:29:25.380
<i>The brain is ready.</i>

409
00:29:27.415 --> 00:29:28.449
<i>The patient is ready.</i>

410
00:29:28.483 --> 00:29:29.484
<i>Good.</i>

411
00:30:44.992 --> 00:30:45.893
Ugh.

412
00:32:26.662 --> 00:32:27.495
Hello?

413
00:33:27.656 --> 00:33:29.525
Deer Gas Market, this is Mary.

414
00:33:29.558 --> 00:33:30.726
<i>How late
are you open until?</i>


415
00:33:31.627 --> 00:33:32.761
We're open 24 hours.

416
00:33:33.027 --> 00:33:33.762
<i>Thank you.</i>

417
00:33:48.376 --> 00:33:49.745
Deer Gas Market, this is Mary.

418
00:33:49.778 --> 00:33:51.145
<i>How late
are you open until?</i>


419
00:33:52.648 --> 00:33:54.315
Didn't you just call?

420
00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:21.743
Deer Gas Market, this is Mary.

421
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:23.612
<i>How late
are you open until?</i>


422
00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:25.681
You already...

423
00:34:25.714 --> 00:34:27.114
<i>Do you like
watching people die?</i>


424
00:34:55.978 --> 00:34:56.912
<i>Hey, this is Debbie.</i>

425
00:34:56.945 --> 00:34:58.446
<i>Thanks for Calling.</i>

426
00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:00.181
Hey Deb, it's me calling.

427
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:03.284
Could you call me at
the number I left?


428
00:35:03.317 --> 00:35:05.554
I really need to talk to you.

429
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:17.959
Get a grip.

430
00:36:34.475 --> 00:36:35.309
Shit.

431
00:36:54.696 --> 00:36:55.429
Hey.

432
00:36:55.864 --> 00:36:56.598
Hi.

433
00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:57.364
Is Ed here?

434
00:36:57.866 --> 00:36:59.400
No, he's not in until morning.

435
00:36:59.601 --> 00:37:00.334
Uh-huh.

436
00:37:01.837 --> 00:37:03.839
Uh, fill her up, diesel.

437
00:37:05.073 --> 00:37:05.807
Um...

438
00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:07.843
Is that pump number two?

439
00:37:08.543 --> 00:37:09.544
Yes ma'am.

440
00:37:11.412 --> 00:37:12.246
Okay.

441
00:37:49.885 --> 00:37:51.953
It's not a good
night to be outside.


442
00:37:51.987 --> 00:37:53.655
I'll tell you that for free.

443
00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:57.058
I haven't seen you
around here before.


444
00:37:57.092 --> 00:37:59.460
Oh, it's my first night.

445
00:38:01.428 --> 00:38:01.997
How do you like it?

446
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:03.932
Yeah.

447
00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:04.833
It's good.

448
00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:06.001
So what are you?

449
00:38:06.034 --> 00:38:07.002
You a student or something?

450
00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:08.435
No.

451
00:38:09.905 --> 00:38:11.840
Well, it's about time they got

452
00:38:11.873 --> 00:38:14.341
someone pretty working here.

453
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:18.914
So, why does a beautiful
young woman like yourself


454
00:38:19.948 --> 00:38:21.550
work in a dump like this?

455
00:38:22.516 --> 00:38:23.952
'Cause I needed a job.

456
00:38:24.786 --> 00:38:26.688
You should get a boyfriend
to take care of you.


457
00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:28.790
I don't have a boyfriend.

458
00:38:28.824 --> 00:38:29.658
Oh.

459
00:38:32.594 --> 00:38:33.862
Now how come you haven't
got a boyfriend?


460
00:38:34.529 --> 00:38:35.564
Because I tried to kill him.

461
00:38:35.597 --> 00:38:38.800
That'll be $159.75, please.

462
00:38:43.805 --> 00:38:45.040
Hot damn.

463
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:46.741
I think I'm in love.

464
00:38:47.809 --> 00:38:49.711
Is that debit, or credit?

465
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:50.579
Credit.

466
00:38:53.949 --> 00:38:55.984
If you ever get tired of
not having a man around,


467
00:38:56.017 --> 00:38:59.988
you know, I'm always
open 24 hours.


468
00:39:01.823 --> 00:39:02.858
Thanks,

469
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:04.893
but I'm not going to be
dating anyone for a while.


470
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.493
Ah.

471
00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:11.432
What a waste of machinery.

472
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:29.651
Oh, shit.

473
00:39:33.121 --> 00:39:36.091
Hey, hey, you forgot
your credit card!


474
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.491
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.


475
00:40:10.525 --> 00:40:11.126
Oh, shit.

476
00:40:13.762 --> 00:40:14.996
What the Hell are you doing?

477
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.563
I was screaming your name.

478
00:40:15.597 --> 00:40:16.998
I thought you'd hear me.

479
00:40:17.198 --> 00:40:17.933
I didn't.

480
00:40:18.867 --> 00:40:19.634
What are you doing out here?

481
00:40:19.668 --> 00:40:21.870
Someone forgot
their credit card.


482
00:40:22.671 --> 00:40:23.437
God damn.

483
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:24.973
Oh my God.
Your lip is bleeding.


484
00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:25.907
Well, yeah, no shit.

485
00:40:25.941 --> 00:40:27.008
You punched me in the face.

486
00:40:27.042 --> 00:40:28.143
Sorry.

487
00:40:28.176 --> 00:40:29.244
Come on, let's go inside.

488
00:40:29.277 --> 00:40:30.078
Shit.

489
00:40:34.716 --> 00:40:36.217
That is some right
hook you got there.


490
00:40:37.085 --> 00:40:38.920
I'm sorry.

491
00:40:38.954 --> 00:40:40.221
I thought it was somebody else.

492
00:40:40.255 --> 00:40:42.123
I'd hate to be
that somebody else.


493
00:40:42.924 --> 00:40:43.758
Yeah.

494
00:40:44.759 --> 00:40:45.593
You would.

495
00:40:47.662 --> 00:40:49.965
Oh, I'm sorry.

496
00:40:49.998 --> 00:40:51.566
It's fine.

497
00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:52.600
It's fine.

498
00:40:52.634 --> 00:40:53.168
Sorry.

499
00:40:56.604 --> 00:40:58.907
So, what are you doing here?

500
00:40:59.975 --> 00:41:03.144
Ed said that he wanted me
to come check up on you.


501
00:41:06.147 --> 00:41:07.248
How's everything going?

502
00:41:07.282 --> 00:41:11.052
Well, I've had one customer.

503
00:41:13.822 --> 00:41:14.389
You know him?

504
00:41:14.823 --> 00:41:17.125
Big, tall, bald-headed
guy, drives a truck?


505
00:41:17.158 --> 00:41:18.126
That's him.

506
00:41:18.326 --> 00:41:18.994
Yeah.

507
00:41:19.027 --> 00:41:20.795
He left that here on purpose.

508
00:41:21.296 --> 00:41:23.565
Why would he do that?

509
00:41:23.765 --> 00:41:26.634
Well, because he fucked the
last girl that worked here,


510
00:41:26.668 --> 00:41:28.003
until Ed walked in on them.

511
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:30.205
Ugh.

512
00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:32.741
How could anyone
sleep with that guy?


513
00:41:32.774 --> 00:41:35.509
He paid her.

514
00:41:37.312 --> 00:41:39.180
That's disgusting.

515
00:41:39.881 --> 00:41:41.816
He used to fuck her right there.

516
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:42.684
Oh!

517
00:41:50.725 --> 00:41:52.894
So how is everything going?

518
00:41:56.998 --> 00:41:57.899
I'm fine.

519
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.735
Ed told me you were in prison?

520
00:42:02.704 --> 00:42:03.304
Right.

521
00:42:04.205 --> 00:42:06.708
So that's why he wanted
you to check up on me.


522
00:42:07.275 --> 00:42:09.210
Make sure I'm not
stealing anything?


523
00:42:09.244 --> 00:42:11.846
No, he just want to make
sure everything is okay.


524
00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:14.582
So?

525
00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:16.584
Looks pretty good from
where I'm standing.


526
00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:25.293
Can I ask you a question?

527
00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:29.798
Sure.

528
00:42:30.999 --> 00:42:33.835
Why did you set your
boyfriend on fire?


529
00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:45.046
I guess word gets
out pretty fast.


530
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:53.154
Do you really want to know?

531
00:42:54.856 --> 00:42:56.157
Do you want to talk about it?

532
00:43:00.061 --> 00:43:01.162
Not really.

533
00:43:02.363 --> 00:43:03.665
Yeah, okay.

534
00:43:08.236 --> 00:43:09.904
My boyfriend was, um...

535
00:43:12.307 --> 00:43:14.042
James Lincoln Fields.

536
00:43:16.211 --> 00:43:17.812
The Rain Ripper?

537
00:43:19.948 --> 00:43:20.782
Yeah.

538
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.418
He killed like 30 women.

539
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:24.285
35.

540
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:30.725
So I guess that makes
you <i>The Watcher.</i>


541
00:43:31.993 --> 00:43:32.827
Yep.

542
00:43:34.762 --> 00:43:36.264
That's what the press called me.

543
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.735
You watched all those
girls get killed?


544
00:43:43.304 --> 00:43:44.806
Not all of them.

545
00:43:46.241 --> 00:43:47.842
How'd that
make you feel?


546
00:43:53.381 --> 00:43:55.183
Like I wanted to die.

547
00:44:00.455 --> 00:44:03.124
I still want to die every day.

548
00:44:03.592 --> 00:44:05.226
You don't have to
talk about this.


549
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.394
No, it's fine.

550
00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:11.299
How did you find out?

551
00:44:13.168 --> 00:44:14.135
You know, that he was...

552
00:44:14.169 --> 00:44:15.336
Killing people?

553
00:44:20.842 --> 00:44:22.844
Can I get a sip of that?

554
00:44:24.279 --> 00:44:25.113
Thanks.

555
00:44:38.193 --> 00:44:42.230
I came home from work
one night and...


556
00:44:44.899 --> 00:44:48.369
the house smelled really bad.

557
00:44:51.973 --> 00:44:54.242
<i>I thought
it was an animal</i>


558
00:44:54.275 --> 00:44:57.011
<i>or a backed up sewer pipe.</i>

559
00:44:57.845 --> 00:45:02.750
<i>So, I want down
into the basement.</i>


560
00:45:03.484 --> 00:45:05.320
<i>And...</i>

561
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:09.257
<i>it was completely flooded.</i>

562
00:45:14.462 --> 00:45:16.164
The smell was...

563
00:45:17.999 --> 00:45:18.967
too much to take.

564
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.072
So, I was about to go
upstairs to get James.


565
00:45:25.506 --> 00:45:26.341
<i>Then I saw.</i>

566
00:45:29.578 --> 00:45:30.878
<i>The body parts.</i>

567
00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:36.818
<i>That's when I knew.</i>

568
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.923
<i>He'd been burying bodies
underneath our house.</i>


569
00:45:43.825 --> 00:45:46.361
<i>And I turned around
to get James.</i>


570
00:45:48.896 --> 00:45:51.065
And he was waiting for me.

571
00:45:53.968 --> 00:45:55.503
That's how you knew it was him?

572
00:46:01.009 --> 00:46:04.412
I always thought there
was something going on, but...


573
00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:09.851
like, I guess I didn't
want to believe it.


574
00:46:19.227 --> 00:46:20.061
Gosh.

575
00:46:23.464 --> 00:46:24.299
What did you do?

576
00:46:29.137 --> 00:46:29.971
Nothing.

577
00:46:32.907 --> 00:46:34.976
I just let it all happen.

578
00:46:37.211 --> 00:46:38.279
Why didn't you run?

579
00:46:38.313 --> 00:46:40.148
Why didn't you go to the cops?

580
00:46:42.651 --> 00:46:46.888
He said he was going to
kill me and my whole family.


581
00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:52.927
I'm not making
excuses or myself, but...


582
00:46:55.496 --> 00:46:57.533
I was young and scared,

583
00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:03.137
and... I didn't know
what else to do.


584
00:47:11.079 --> 00:47:13.981
He made me watch after that.

585
00:47:16.451 --> 00:47:18.319
What made you stop?

586
00:47:20.355 --> 00:47:23.491
Her name was Christine Rogers.

587
00:47:26.628 --> 00:47:28.262
She was so young.

588
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.634
After that I didn't
want to live anymore.


589
00:47:34.435 --> 00:47:35.436
So...

590
00:47:37.972 --> 00:47:39.040
while he was sleeping...

591
00:47:41.342 --> 00:47:43.010
I set the house on fire.

592
00:47:46.114 --> 00:47:47.415
With you inside?

593
00:47:54.989 --> 00:47:56.391
He's still alive, right?

594
00:48:00.328 --> 00:48:01.496
And why the rain?

595
00:48:03.364 --> 00:48:06.234
So their souls
could be cleansed.


596
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:17.445
I got really sick.

597
00:48:20.649 --> 00:48:23.351
I couldn't tell what was real,

598
00:48:24.419 --> 00:48:25.420
what was not.

599
00:48:29.157 --> 00:48:32.994
I was seeing the
victims everywhere.


600
00:48:35.631 --> 00:48:36.665
How are you doing now?

601
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:43.171
Good days and bad.

602
00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.375
But I'm getting better.

603
00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:50.178
That's good to hear.

604
00:48:59.588 --> 00:49:00.988
Could you, uh...

605
00:49:02.156 --> 00:49:03.592
Could you not tell anyone?

606
00:49:04.526 --> 00:49:07.061
I won't tell anyone.

607
00:49:07.094 --> 00:49:08.463
I think people are going
to find out though.


608
00:49:10.097 --> 00:49:11.232
Yeah, I know.

609
00:49:13.602 --> 00:49:15.203
Look, I gotta go.

610
00:49:16.705 --> 00:49:19.608
- Okay.
- You going to be okay?


611
00:49:19.641 --> 00:49:20.475
Yeah.

612
00:49:27.248 --> 00:49:29.585
Got any questions
for me before I go?


613
00:49:32.721 --> 00:49:34.355
Does anyone actually eat those?

614
00:49:35.557 --> 00:49:37.593
Oh, these little things?

615
00:49:41.162 --> 00:49:42.396
Let's see here.

616
00:49:46.835 --> 00:49:47.669
Mmmm.

617
00:49:49.771 --> 00:49:52.608
Oh, ewwww.

618
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:54.676
You don't know what
you're missing.


619
00:49:55.711 --> 00:49:56.545
Oh, God.

620
00:49:57.746 --> 00:49:59.046
That's so gross.

621
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:04.586
Thanks for the
pig's tongue, Mary.


622
00:50:05.386 --> 00:50:07.321
I'll tell Ed you're
doing just fine.


623
00:50:08.857 --> 00:50:09.591
Thanks.

624
00:50:10.124 --> 00:50:11.425

Do you have a bathroom?

627
00:50:36.284 --> 00:50:38.185
Yeah, it's just outside.

What are you doing here?

657
00:56:05.479 --> 00:56:06.380
I was driving by

658
00:56:06.413 --> 00:56:07.949
and I thought I'd
see how you're doing?


659
00:56:08.984 --> 00:56:10.852
It's kind of late for
you to be out, isn't it?


660
00:56:10.886 --> 00:56:11.953
I don't sleep much.

661
00:56:12.621 --> 00:56:13.788
Don't the phones work here?

You know you really don't have
to keep checking up on me.


663

I'm not checking up on you.

664
00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:20.461
Ed called me and asked me
some questions about you.


665
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:21.563
Great.

666
00:56:22.631 --> 00:56:23.832
Did you tell him everything?

667
00:56:25.667 --> 00:56:26.334
You know what?

668
00:56:26.368 --> 00:56:27.936
Why don't you just send me back?

Is that what you want?

670
00:56:30.105 --> 00:56:31.306
For your information, I told him

671
00:56:31.339 --> 00:56:34.075
that you were a good person
caught up in a bad situation.


672
00:56:34.376 --> 00:56:36.044
And now trying to put
your live back into order.


673
00:56:37.012 --> 00:56:38.013
Thanks.

674
00:56:38.445 --> 00:56:39.681
Are you okay?

675
00:56:41.049 --> 00:56:41.917
I'm fine.

676
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.922
I'm going to use the
bathroom, where is it?


677
00:56:48.489 --> 00:56:49.925
The one outside's out of order.

678
00:56:50.859 --> 00:56:52.594
You'll have to use
the one in the back.


679
00:56:52.627 --> 00:56:53.561
The thin key will let you in.

680
00:56:55.563 --> 00:56:56.131
Thanks.

681
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.114
Can I help y...?

682
00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:27.494
Hello, Mary.

683
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:33.001
You're not real, you're
not real, you're not real.


684
00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:44.145
I'm real.

685
00:57:54.189 --> 00:57:55.156
I heard they let you out,

686
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.125
so I thought I'd come
see how you're doing.


687
00:58:00.795 --> 00:58:02.163
You still don't think
I'm real, do you?


688
00:58:04.599 --> 00:58:06.067
Mmm.

689
00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:07.936
You still seeing things
you don't want to believe?


690
00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:12.540
Well, you're just like me, Mary.

691
00:58:12.574 --> 00:58:14.242
You liked watching them die.

692
00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:16.111
I'm not like you.

693
00:58:17.078 --> 00:58:18.146
You're worse.

694
00:58:19.881 --> 00:58:21.750
You could have stopped me.

695
00:58:21.783 --> 00:58:23.051
But you didn't.

696
00:58:24.185 --> 00:58:25.754
You let people die.

697
00:58:26.988 --> 00:58:28.223
<i>Innocent</i> people die.

698
00:58:29.257 --> 00:58:30.291
I was sick.

699
00:58:30.325 --> 00:58:33.094
Still believing in your lies?

700
00:58:34.729 --> 00:58:35.563
<i>Still.</i>

701
00:58:39.134 --> 00:58:41.136
This is not happening.

702
00:58:44.272 --> 00:58:46.007
You will watch
people die tonight.


703
00:58:48.176 --> 00:58:51.813
And I'll bet you 10 to one

704
00:58:51.846 --> 00:58:53.281
that you will like it.

705
00:58:53.948 --> 00:58:54.783
And then

706
00:58:57.118 --> 00:58:58.853
I'll watch you die.

707
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:03.658
And there is nothing
you can do about it.


708
00:59:09.264 --> 00:59:11.900
You know, my parole
officer is in the back.


709
00:59:11.933 --> 00:59:13.101
You don't think I know that?

710
00:59:14.002 --> 00:59:15.136
Well, I'm going to tell him.

711
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:16.204
Mmm.

712
00:59:19.674 --> 00:59:21.242
What if I'm not real?

713
00:59:24.179 --> 00:59:27.115
They'll put you
away forever, Mary.


714
00:59:30.018 --> 00:59:32.087
I know you're not real.

715
00:59:33.054 --> 00:59:35.824
And I'm going to
prove it to you.


716
00:59:49.704 --> 00:59:50.872
I'd like some gas, please.

717
00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.875
Sure.

718
00:59:53.908 --> 00:59:56.377
Can I have $10 on
pump number three?


719
00:59:57.378 --> 00:59:58.213
Okay.

720
01:00:00.815 --> 01:00:02.617
It's really coming
down out there.


721
01:00:03.985 --> 01:00:04.819
Yeah.

722
01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:08.289
And $10 is your change.

723
01:00:09.924 --> 01:00:10.925
Thank you.

724
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.329
How late are you open until?

725
01:00:21.302 --> 01:00:23.838
Why do you keep calling me?

726
01:00:23.872 --> 01:00:24.939
What do you mean?

727
01:00:24.973 --> 01:00:26.241
You called me.

728
01:00:26.274 --> 01:00:27.108
Earlier.

729
01:00:27.976 --> 01:00:29.277
I know it was you.

730
01:00:30.311 --> 01:00:31.846
I'm sorry, do I know you?

731
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.381
You know who I am.

732
01:00:33.414 --> 01:00:35.250
What the fuck do you want?

733
01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:38.219
I think you are mistaking
me for someone else, dear.


734
01:00:38.253 --> 01:00:39.220
Don't you lie to me.

735
01:00:39.254 --> 01:00:40.688
I am on to you.

736
01:00:40.722 --> 01:00:43.024
- I am fucking on to you, lady.
- Hey!


737
01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:43.825
What's going on?

738
01:00:44.058 --> 01:00:46.294
This woman has been
calling me all night.


739
01:00:46.327 --> 01:00:48.163
I don't know what
she is talking about.


740
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:49.330
She's one of them.

741
01:00:49.364 --> 01:00:50.231
One of who, Mary?

742
01:00:51.232 --> 01:00:55.069
Okay, someone has been
calling me and making threats.


743
01:00:55.103 --> 01:00:56.271
You think that lady was her?

744
01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:00.308
I don't know.

745
01:01:00.341 --> 01:01:01.476
Well, why didn't
you tell me this?


746
01:01:01.509 --> 01:01:03.444
Because I'm paranoid
and delusional.


747
01:01:03.478 --> 01:01:04.279
Remember?

748
01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:05.747
Well, you should
have told me this.


749
01:01:08.183 --> 01:01:09.150
Look, you need to
tell me everything


750
01:01:09.184 --> 01:01:10.351
and be honest with me.

751
01:01:11.286 --> 01:01:12.754
That's the only way
this is going to work.


752
01:01:14.856 --> 01:01:15.323
You understand?

753
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.791
Okay.

754
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.261
It's late.

755
01:01:24.199 --> 01:01:25.700
Have a nice night.

756
01:01:28.136 --> 01:01:28.970
Thanks.

757
01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:54.329
Debbie?

758
01:03:32.193 --> 01:03:33.294
<i>You've
reached Tom Doogan.</i>


759
01:03:33.328 --> 01:03:34.429
<i>Leave your name and number.</i>

760
01:03:35.396 --> 01:03:37.498
Tom, I need you to call me.

761
01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:39.467
I think something's happening.

762
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:42.170
Please call me.

763
01:03:53.481 --> 01:03:54.482
<i>9-1-1.</i>

764
01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.488
Everything's fine.

765
01:04:02.023 --> 01:04:03.358
Everything's fine.

766
01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:05.059
Nothing's happening.

767
01:04:11.533 --> 01:04:12.634
Hello?

768
01:04:12.668 --> 01:04:14.636
<i>This is Sam from
emergency services.</i>


769
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:16.504
<i>We received a call
from this number?</i>


770
01:04:16.538 --> 01:04:20.576
Sorry, I thought I hung
up before I connected.


771
01:04:20.609 --> 01:04:21.577
<i>Do you have an emergency?</i>

772
01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:24.078
No, I didn't mean to call.

773
01:04:24.112 --> 01:04:24.946
Sorry.

774
01:05:12.628 --> 01:05:13.695
<i>If you'd
like to make a call...</i>


775
01:05:13.729 --> 01:05:14.563
Fuck.

776
01:07:05.641 --> 01:07:08.376
You're not real,
you're not real.


777
01:07:17.786 --> 01:07:18.787
Mary.

778
01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:19.721
Oh my God.

779
01:07:33.669 --> 01:07:35.102
Help me.

780
01:07:35.136 --> 01:07:36.137
Help me, please.

781
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.674
Hey, settle down.

782
01:07:38.707 --> 01:07:41.777
We need to call the police.

783
01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:43.444
He's trying to kill me.

784
01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:44.880
Everything is going
to be all right.


785
01:07:44.913 --> 01:07:45.747
You don't understand.

786
01:07:47.649 --> 01:07:48.650
Oh fuck.

787
01:07:48.684 --> 01:07:49.585
The phone's still dead.

788
01:07:57.759 --> 01:07:59.595
Do you remember her?

789
01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:10.271
She was 18 years old.

790
01:08:11.773 --> 01:08:14.610
She was a freshman in college.

791
01:08:16.612 --> 01:08:18.714
She was gonna be a doctor.

792
01:08:20.448 --> 01:08:22.216
But you and that monster,

793
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:24.720
you took all of
that away from her.


794
01:08:26.287 --> 01:08:26.888
I didn't.

795
01:08:27.623 --> 01:08:31.526
You watched him
kill my daughter!


796
01:08:44.973 --> 01:08:47.408
When I heard they let you out,

797
01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:49.611
I just had to come and
do something about it.


798
01:08:50.078 --> 01:08:51.713
No!

799
01:10:57.939 --> 01:10:58.940
No!

800
01:11:05.847 --> 01:11:06.848
Are you okay?

801
01:11:06.882 --> 01:11:07.682
Yeah.

802
01:11:19.728 --> 01:11:20.695
Is she dead?

803
01:11:20.729 --> 01:11:21.563
Yeah.

804
01:11:22.531 --> 01:11:24.566
I tried to call you but
the phones are down.


805
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.734
I know.

806
01:11:26.968 --> 01:11:29.503
She said that I
killed her daughter.


807
01:11:30.806 --> 01:11:33.108
Her name is Carol Rogers.

808
01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:34.375
Her daughter was Christine.

809
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:36.443
No.

810
01:11:42.784 --> 01:11:44.986
Is anyone ever
going to forgive me?


811
01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.487
No.

812
01:11:52.694 --> 01:11:53.795
Fuck.

813
01:11:53.829 --> 01:11:54.596
What's wrong?

814
01:11:55.897 --> 01:11:56.965
We have to get
hold of the police.


815
01:11:58.700 --> 01:11:59.835
Why did you come back?

816
01:12:01.603 --> 01:12:03.004
I have something to tell you.

817
01:12:03.038 --> 01:12:03.839
What?

818
01:12:04.873 --> 01:12:05.807
Come on we have to go.

819
01:12:05.841 --> 01:12:07.709
No, tell me what it is.

820
01:12:07.742 --> 01:12:08.977
There was an accident
at the prison.


821
01:12:09.945 --> 01:12:11.046
What kind of accident?

822
01:12:11.613 --> 01:12:13.982
A major storm shut
the power down.


823
01:12:14.249 --> 01:12:15.416
Some prisoners escaped.

824
01:12:16.751 --> 01:12:18.385
James was one of
those prisoners.


825
01:12:20.956 --> 01:12:21.823
He's real.

826
01:12:22.389 --> 01:12:23.457
They didn't want me to tell you

827
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:24.559
because they didn't think
he would come after you.


828
01:12:26.728 --> 01:12:27.562
He was here.

829
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.865
What?

830
01:12:41.442 --> 01:12:42.143
No.

831
01:12:42.177 --> 01:12:43.011
Don't.

832
01:12:44.145 --> 01:12:45.113
Please.

833
01:13:59.187 --> 01:14:00.989
I told you I was real.

834
01:14:03.692 --> 01:14:05.160
I'm sorry for hitting you.

835
01:14:05.193 --> 01:14:06.493
You okay?

836
01:14:11.733 --> 01:14:12.734
I've been watching you.

837
01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:21.843
I really thought that woman
was going to kill you.


838
01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.856
Then Tom did me a favor.

839
01:14:34.889 --> 01:14:36.925
He killed her so
I didn't have to.


840
01:14:38.226 --> 01:14:39.594
And now we're together again.

841
01:14:43.865 --> 01:14:45.533
Just like old times.

842
01:14:47.168 --> 01:14:48.103
What are you going to do?

843
01:14:49.637 --> 01:14:50.772
You know what I'm going to do.

844
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:54.743
No, please don't.

845
01:15:02.017 --> 01:15:02.817
Debbie.

846
01:15:06.721 --> 01:15:08.256
You don't have to do this.

847
01:15:09.224 --> 01:15:10.191
Yes I do.

848
01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.748
I trusted you.

849
01:15:36.051 --> 01:15:38.053
And this is how you repay me.

850
01:15:38.086 --> 01:15:40.088
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

851
01:15:40.955 --> 01:15:41.823
You should be.

852
01:15:43.124 --> 01:15:44.125
No.

853
01:15:52.734 --> 01:15:53.735
Watch me, Mary.

854
01:15:54.936 --> 01:15:55.637
No.

855
01:15:55.904 --> 01:15:56.738
Watch!

856
01:16:24.799 --> 01:16:26.167
Watch me, Mary.

857
01:16:26.401 --> 01:16:29.938
No, no, no.

858
01:16:51.793 --> 01:16:53.728
Please, please don't.

859
01:16:54.362 --> 01:16:56.297
Please, please.

860
01:16:56.331 --> 01:16:57.765
Debbie.

861
01:16:57.966 --> 01:16:58.867
Please stop.

862
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.068
Tell me you love me.

863
01:17:01.269 --> 01:17:02.303
No.

864
01:17:03.037 --> 01:17:05.240
Tell me you love me and
I won't let her die.


865
01:17:12.347 --> 01:17:13.648
I love you.

866
01:17:14.415 --> 01:17:16.017
I love you too.

867
01:17:27.929 --> 01:17:30.064
I love you so much.

868
01:17:30.098 --> 01:17:30.965
Fuck!

869
01:17:32.066 --> 01:17:33.001
I do this all for you.

870
01:17:33.034 --> 01:17:34.235
You know that, don't you?

871
01:17:59.327 --> 01:18:00.128
Debbie.

872
01:18:12.273 --> 01:18:13.508
Phew.

873
01:18:25.086 --> 01:18:26.487
You like to watch, don't you?

874
01:18:31.993 --> 01:18:32.827
Say it.

875
01:18:34.495 --> 01:18:35.330
No.

876
01:18:39.334 --> 01:18:41.302
You disappoint me, Mary.

877
01:18:47.442 --> 01:18:49.244
You like watching
people burn, don't you?


878
01:18:51.279 --> 01:18:52.180
Fuck you.

879
01:19:19.007 --> 01:19:21.175
Soon we'll be together again.

880
01:19:21.476 --> 01:19:24.345
I will never be with you.

881
01:19:29.551 --> 01:19:31.119
Help me!

882
01:19:31.152 --> 01:19:32.120
Help me!

883
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:30.378
Ed keeps a gun in his locker.

884
01:20:30.411 --> 01:20:31.412
What?

885
01:20:31.446 --> 01:20:32.180
In his locker, 37.

886
01:20:32.213 --> 01:20:32.715
It's right there.

887
01:20:32.748 --> 01:20:34.015
- Go get it.
- Ok.


888
01:20:34.048 --> 01:20:35.551
Go get it before he comes back.

889
01:20:37.251 --> 01:20:39.588
The one with the lock.

890
01:20:39.621 --> 01:20:40.421
Do you have a key?

891
01:20:40.455 --> 01:20:41.456
No.

892
01:20:41.489 --> 01:20:42.457
Fuck.

893
01:20:44.192 --> 01:20:46.994
Mary, Mary, there's
a pipe right there.


894
01:20:47.028 --> 01:20:48.062
There's a pipe right there.

895
01:20:57.372 --> 01:20:58.172
Hello?

896
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:15.390
Shit.

897
01:21:22.497 --> 01:21:23.599
Hey, darling!

898
01:21:23.632 --> 01:21:24.465
You here?

899
01:21:25.567 --> 01:21:27.135
I forgot my credit card.

900
01:21:28.136 --> 01:21:28.903
Hey.

901
01:21:28.936 --> 01:21:30.972
See that little
lever, on the top?


902
01:21:31.372 --> 01:21:32.273
That opens the rifle.

903
01:21:34.743 --> 01:21:36.411
Put two shells in.

904
01:21:38.446 --> 01:21:39.180
That's a girl.

905
01:21:41.449 --> 01:21:42.417
Hurry up.

906
01:21:43.652 --> 01:21:46.187
Hurry up, hurry, hurry.

907
01:22:11.512 --> 01:22:12.313
Shit.

908
01:22:14.182 --> 01:22:14.982
Oh, Jesus.

909
01:22:17.418 --> 01:22:19.555
Untie me, untie me.

910
01:22:19.588 --> 01:22:20.622
There you go.

911
01:22:25.059 --> 01:22:26.461
Come on.

912
01:22:32.366 --> 01:22:34.502
<i>9-1-1, please
state your emergency.</i>


913
01:22:34.837 --> 01:22:37.405
I'm at Deer Gas
Market, off Highway Six.


914
01:22:37.438 --> 01:22:40.441
I think someone might
have robbed the place.


915
01:22:40.475 --> 01:22:41.509
You better send a car down here.

916
01:22:42.544 --> 01:22:43.645
<i>Sir, please
stay in your car</i>


917
01:22:43.679 --> 01:22:45.413
<i>until the authorities arrive.</i>

918
01:22:45.446 --> 01:22:47.381
Uh-huh, will do.

919
01:23:10.471 --> 01:23:13.407
Just keep that rifle
trained on the door.


920
01:23:14.008 --> 01:23:16.277
As soon as he walks
in, pull the trigger.


921
01:23:17.478 --> 01:23:19.280
I won't die here.

922
01:23:19.313 --> 01:23:20.682
I won't fucking die here.

923
01:23:26.688 --> 01:23:28.489
I'm supposed to
pick you up at six.


924
01:23:36.532 --> 01:23:38.634
Keep it covered.
Keep it covered.


925
01:23:42.136 --> 01:23:46.107
As soon as he walks
in, blow him away.


926
01:24:08.362 --> 01:24:09.698
Shit.

927
01:24:09.731 --> 01:24:10.732
Get ready.

928
01:24:39.828 --> 01:24:41.362
Come on, you fucker.

929
01:25:02.751 --> 01:25:04.485
- I shot him.
- Come on.


930
01:25:17.833 --> 01:25:18.667
Oh, no.

931
01:25:26.642 --> 01:25:27.676
It's not him.

932
01:25:28.977 --> 01:25:31.847
I shot someone.

933
01:25:32.213 --> 01:25:33.915
It's not your fault.

934
01:25:37.218 --> 01:25:37.686
You didn't know.

935
01:25:38.787 --> 01:25:40.622
I did, I pulled the trigger.

936
01:25:41.023 --> 01:25:42.223
Give me the gun.

937
01:25:43.925 --> 01:25:45.393
And the shells. Come on.

938
01:25:50.231 --> 01:25:51.600
It's my fucking fault.

939
01:26:05.847 --> 01:26:07.683
If he walks through that door,

940
01:26:07.716 --> 01:26:09.183
I'll blow his fucking head off.

941
01:26:09.951 --> 01:26:12.486
No, no we can't stay here.

942
01:26:13.855 --> 01:26:14.723
We'll die.

943
01:26:15.557 --> 01:26:16.390
Come on.

944
01:26:38.613 --> 01:26:39.681
Stay close to me.

945
01:26:41.717 --> 01:26:43.719
How many rounds you got?

946
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.519
Two.

947
01:26:46.287 --> 01:26:46.922
Okay.

948
01:26:47.656 --> 01:26:48.489
Okay.

949
01:27:06.908 --> 01:27:07.776
The Police are here.

950
01:27:07.809 --> 01:27:08.810
Yeah.

951
01:27:08.844 --> 01:27:09.878
Okay, let's go.

952
01:27:11.512 --> 01:27:12.346
Come on.

953
01:27:28.530 --> 01:27:29.363
Oh fuck.

954
01:27:41.977 --> 01:27:43.377
This is Officer Collins.

955
01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:46.982
I'm out on Old Cold Bank
Road, Deer Gas Market,


956
01:27:47.015 --> 01:27:48.917
responding to a 9-1-1 call.

957
01:27:50.118 --> 01:27:51.485
Hopping out to have a look.

958
01:27:57.025 --> 01:27:57.993
Oh, please!

959
01:27:58.026 --> 01:27:58.860
Get on the ground!

960
01:27:58.894 --> 01:27:59.928
He's gonna kill me!

961
01:27:59.961 --> 01:28:00.796
- No, on the ground.
- Please.


962
01:28:00.829 --> 01:28:01.730
Calm down.

963
01:28:01.763 --> 01:28:03.064
Is anybody else in there?

964
01:28:03.865 --> 01:28:05.567
Yes, he's coming.

965
01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.902
We need to leave now.

966
01:28:07.135 --> 01:28:07.936
Stand up.

967
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:09.704
Slowly.

968
01:28:10.705 --> 01:28:11.873
Tell me what's going on.

969
01:28:12.774 --> 01:28:13.875
He's in the store.

970
01:28:14.276 --> 01:28:15.309
<i>Who's</i> in the store?

971
01:28:15.911 --> 01:28:17.813
James Lincoln Fields.

972
01:28:17.846 --> 01:28:18.947
He's coming after me.

973
01:28:19.881 --> 01:28:20.882
Get in the car.

974
01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:21.583
Get in the car.

975
01:28:34.095 --> 01:28:34.996
This is officer Collins...

976
01:28:35.396 --> 01:28:36.665
No, no!

977
01:29:37.926 --> 01:29:38.760
Hello?

978
01:29:58.246 --> 01:29:59.080
Hello?

979
01:32:34.302 --> 01:32:35.103
Hey!

980
01:32:35.136 --> 01:32:37.138
Stop, stop, stop!

981
01:32:37.172 --> 01:32:38.740
Hey, stop!

982
01:32:38.773 --> 01:32:39.874
Please, stop!

983
01:33:35.196 --> 01:33:36.364
Mary!

984
01:33:42.203 --> 01:33:43.238
Fuck.

985
01:34:10.198 --> 01:34:11.299
Stay with me.

986
01:34:23.444 --> 01:34:26.047
I'm not leaving here
without you, Mary.


987
01:34:35.323 --> 01:34:37.091
It's time to go home.

988
01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:33.474
<i>9-1-1, Please
state your emergency.</i>


989
01:36:45.353 --> 01:36:46.421
I love you.
