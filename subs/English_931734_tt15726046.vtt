I'm alone, and I
don't want to die alone.

You have me.

97
00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.184

101
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.106
Okay, first of all, it was

102
00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:43.726
an erectile dysfunction commercial, okay?

103
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.511

Now I just have her,
and you know how she is.


112

be in her own diva-denise way.

115
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.761
opened up at tea
time and I told them

116
00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.946
I was gonna go for it,
my dad was 100% in my corner,


117
00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.016
and 100% sure I
would get it, you know?

118
00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:26.851
But my mother,

119
00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:30.221

to save face if I didn't.


120
00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.141
But, that's why you gotta do it.

121
00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.944
You gotta do it for yourself,
you gotta do it for you father,


122
00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.512
you gotta prove her wrong.

123
00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.795
You got this,

124
00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.615

right there cheering you on.

162
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.564
mmm, that's all that's left of that one.

163
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.633
Where'd you hide the body?

164
00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:24.369
- Monica: Ha ha.
- Really, mrs. Fletcher?


165
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:25.903
It's 8 a.M.

166
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.658
Calm your tits, it's just a
little peach schnapps.


167
00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:30.826
You know, I swear I'm gonna
come over there one day


168
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.628
and make you something other
than a liquid breakfast.


169
00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:35.546
No, you not. I don't have
people in my house.


170
00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:38.473
I hate company like I hate
people in my business.


171
00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:40.937
Monica: Mrs. Fletcher,
your door!


172
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.488
Ooh!

173
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.391
Oh, yup,
I'm sure that's safe. Bye.


174
00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:47.925
Bye.

175
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.248
Monica: This is probably a
good time to tell you


176
00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:54.632
that andre and I broke up.

177
00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:57.568
- What? When did this happen?
- Where was I?


178
00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:59.221
It happened a few days after the funeral.

179
00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.305
What happened?

180
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.241
Long story short, he cheated.

181
00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:04.709
How'd you find out?

182
00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:06.678
Girl, someone dm'd me a picture

183
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.380
of him having sex in
club savoy's bathroom.


184
00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:11.200
I'll have to see it to believe it.

185
00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.584
I'm not showing
you a picture, be. No.


186
00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:15.186
Sorry.

187
00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:18.956
Your father, and now this?
Are you okay?


188
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.078
- You know what, be?
- I actually am.


189
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:23.479
You know, I woke up this morning,

190
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.415
and all I could think about was
what's next for me.


191
00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.865
Okay.

192
00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.318
Yeah, and hopefully that's tea time.

193
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.087
But yeah, it's
time for me to chase my dreams


194
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:32.054
without any fears,

195
00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.338
like my dad would've wanted me to do.

196
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.992
Monica: Now, that's true tea.

197
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.875
Elodie price: Pinkie's out.

198
00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:42.413
And as always, thank y'all for
tuning in to kqnb's hey h-town.


199
00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.549
- Hey hey, y'all.
- Hey hey.


200
00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:47.136
Director: And we're out.

201
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.188
- Elodie: Woo!
- Yes, oh, that felt so good.


202
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.490
Yes, she is back.

203
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.925
Monica: Mm-hmm.

204
00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:55.745
Tell you what, it is so good
to have you back.


205
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:57.013
It was not the same without you.

206
00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.263
- Oh, stop it.
- Seriously.


207
00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:03.101
- Nice show, ladies.
- Thank you, ms. Rochelle.


208
00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:05.103
Thanks, clark.

209
00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.228
- Monica: Yeah!
- Oh my god!


210
00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:10.274
Monica: Oh my god,

211
00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.294
I'm so glad I didn't know clark
was watching was watching us.


212
00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:13.663
You're already imagining yourself

213
00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:15.297
spinning in her host chair, aren't you?

214
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.215
What? No.

215
00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:20.351
- It's okay.
- I've been doing it, too.


216
00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:23.305
Her longevity, I mean...

217
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:25.174
The power to call her own shots?

218
00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:27.391
Yeah, I want that kind of career.

219
00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:30.328
I'm going for it, and you should too.

220
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.699
- But, let's just make a deal.
- Okay, what?


221
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.802
Promise me that whoever gets it,

222
00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:40.089
we won't let it affect our friendship.

223
00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:42.173
Oh, absolutely.

224
00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:44.108
- I gotta run.
- Okay, girl.


225
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.577
- So glad you're back.
- Yes.


226
00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:52.350
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let me help you with that.


227
00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:55.286
Uh, okay, uh, you're new.

228
00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:57.740
Actually, um, I worked in the control room

229
00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.659
for over a year, and then got
promoted to floor director


230
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:05.930
when sam went to early retirement.

231
00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.666
Aka went back to rehab.

232
00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:12.154
Well, his secret is safe
with me, I love sam.


233
00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.105
Alright.

234
00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.743
It's your job.

235
00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.912
Alright.

236
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.180
Gotcha.

237
00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:23.766
- Thank you.
- You're all done.


238
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.216
Thank you.

239
00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:26.684
- Oh, eric.
- Eric.


240
00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:28.804
- Eric lawson.
- Eric lawson, thank you.


241
00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:31.055
It's my pleasure.

242
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:36.227
- Excuse me.
- Jeff, can we talk?


243
00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:37.862
Jeff: Of course.

244
00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:39.982
Actually, I'd like
the host spot on tea time,


245
00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.784
and I wanted your advice
on what I could do


246
00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.035
to improve my chances.

247
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.425
Truth be told, if it
were solely up to me,

248
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:51.494
tea time would be yours, hands down.

249
00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:53.129
You work harder than anyone here,

250
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.030
and your charisma's undeniable.

251
00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:57.615
Monica, you're a star.

252
00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.050
But, of course,

253
00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:01.036
some people will
say the same about elodie.


254
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.621
Well, elodie's a great choice, too.

255
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.074
See that? That humility?

256
00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:06.842
That's gonna lose you the job.

257
00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:08.960
You've gotta be assertive, monica.

258
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.380
Solo hosting your own show
is a big responsibility,


259
00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.349
and you've got to prove to the higher-ups

260
00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:15.584
that you're up to the task,
that's my advice.


261
00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:17.869
Show us what you're made of.

262
00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:20.356
So, in other news, your
assistant, nate, quit.


263
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.406
- Wait, what?
- When? Why?


264
00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:25.127
I guess you can only be a
low-paid intern for so long,


265
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.611
but don't worry,

266
00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.230
we scrambled and found somebody
to replace him.


267
00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.481
Whoa, without my input?

268
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.434
I know, feel free to fire her
if you don't like her,


269
00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.552
but I'm pretty sure you will.

270
00:12:34.654 --> 00:12:36.153
Monica: Oh my god.

271
00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.433
Let me introduce you to her, come on.

272
00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.660
Monica, this is simone hicks.

273
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.962
Simone, monica harris.

274
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.767
Hi.

275
00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:52.503
Uh, sorry, hi.

276
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.106
- It's nice to meet you.
- Likewise.


277
00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:56.574
Wow.

278
00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:59.977
Side by side, you two actually
look a little alike.


279
00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:03.032
Wow, that's such a compliment.

280
00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:06.450
Let me show you my office, just...

281
00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.237
Simone: You
really paid your dues.


282
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.321
Starting out as an intern,

283
00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:13.925
giving your blood, sweat, and
tears to this station.


284
00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:16.294
Even before you became a tv host.

285
00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:17.913
Nobody, not even elodie price,

286
00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.215
can hold a candle to that.

287
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.850
I even know how
you like your ginger tea

288
00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:23.523
with honey, and not sugar.
I did my research.


289
00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:28.105
I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?

290
00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:31.842
- No. No, it's not you.
- Please, sit down.


291
00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:33.010
Okay.

292
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:38.983
So, enough about all the
research you did on me,


293
00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:41.103
tell me something about you, simone.

294
00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:43.321
Oh, there's not much to tell there.

295
00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:46.108
Um, came here from virginia a
couple of weeks ago.


296
00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:48.225
Virginia? Big leap.

297
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.695
Yeah, I'm still apartment hunting.

298
00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:52.930
Well, welcome to h-town.

299
00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:56.018
I take it you don't have any
friends or family here?


300
00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:58.903
- Yeah, family.
- Pretty distant, though.


301
00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.158
I'm going to look for an
apartment later today.


302
00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:05.561
Well good for you, 
I hope that pans out.

303
00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:07.878
Me too.

304
00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:18.656
- Uh, is everything okay?
- Yup, just my cheating ex.


305
00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:20.124
Sorry. You know what?

306
00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:21.810
I think you should take
the rest of the day off.


307
00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:23.379
Yeah, we can start fresh tomorrow.

308
00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:24.813
I'm all ready to start today.

309
00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:26.263
That's okay.

310
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.517
I have some things I need to
handle anyway, so.


311
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:30.001
Tomorrow.

312
00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:31.120
Alright, thank you monica.

313
00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:34.105
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you, simone.


314
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:37.408
Monica?

315
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.028
Sometimes to see the rainbow,

316
00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:41.879
you gotta put up

Monica: That's
a good question.


475
00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.313
My dad was, um...

476
00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:07.017
He was kind.

477
00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:11.460
He wasn't afraid to make,
like, hard decisions.


478
00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:14.943
You know, no matter
who disagreed with him,


479
00:23:15.027 --> 00:23:17.616
you know, he did what
was right all the time,


480
00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:23.131
and he was just the perfect dad.
He was perfect.


481
00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.438
- Hm. Hm.
- Monica: What?


482
00:23:30.943 --> 00:23:33.710
Oh, it's just, you
know, in my life path,

483
00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:37.080
I've found that nobody is perfect.

484
00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:39.516
He was. To me.

485
00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:40.851
He was perfect,

486
00:23:40.953 --> 00:23:42.871
and I don't know what
I'm gonna do without him.


487
00:23:42.955 --> 00:23:46.690
- Oh, oh monica, okay.
- I'm sorry.


488
00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:49.910
I just don't know what I'm
supposed to do without him!


489
00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:55.465
- Simone: I'm here.
- I'm here now.


490
00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.906
Hey! How you feeling?

491
00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:04.041
Like hell.

492
00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:08.412
- Well, not for long.
- Here we go...


493
00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:11.748
Now this,

494
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.018
all the hangover essentials
I thought you needed,


495
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.154
for work.

496
00:24:22.595 --> 00:24:24.628
Work. Yup.

497
00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:30.267
You didn't have to
do all of this, simone.

498
00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:37.040
Um, don't take this the wrong way,

499
00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:39.876
but how did you get into my
house this morning?


500
00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:48.118
Oh, you're serious?

501
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.121
Oh, after a much needed emotional release,

502
00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:52.823
you begged me to stay.

503
00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.659
- Emotional release?
- Like, I cried?


504
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:57.194
Like a baby.

505
00:24:57.296 --> 00:24:59.080
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

506
00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:02.132
I'm just glad that I was
here in your time of need.


507
00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:05.086
If you're looking for an early
pay raise, it's above me.


508
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.189
Okay, alright, I'm gonna head
back to mrs. Fletcher's


509
00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:10.038
so I can get dressed for work.

510
00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:13.744
Uh, simone?

511
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:17.314
Shirt.

512
00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:19.349
Oh.

513
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.923
It's a little sweaty, sorry.

514
00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:28.291
Mm-hmm.

515
00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:32.863
Just chill for a second,
I'm gonna go, um...


516
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.400
I got you.

517
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.943
Okay...

518
00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.882
Yes.

519
00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:57.220
So, I'm getting rid of some
pieces, and I don't know,


520
00:25:57.322 --> 00:26:00.257
maybe you can take them off my hands.

521
00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:01.825
Yeah!

522
00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:06.630
Oh my god, this stuff is so gorgeous.

523
00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:08.999
Why do you want to throw it away?

524
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:10.819
Sometimes you gotta get rid of the old

525
00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:12.536
to welcome in the new.

526
00:26:12.638 --> 00:26:14.838
But yeah, it's all yours.

527
00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.640
Okay.

528
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.210
Oh, this is beautiful.

529
00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.812
Oh no, no, no, no, no,

530
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:24.432
that wasn't supposed to be
in that pile, I'm sorry.


531
00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:28.752
Um, my dad, he...
He bought this for me.


532
00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:31.822
He said it looked gorgeous
on my dark skin,


533
00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:35.058
and I just, I don't know,
I could never part with it.


534
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.060
I'm sorry.
But, um...


535
00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:41.916
This one, yes. This one here,
this is a good one.


536
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.435
Yeah, I think this will look
amazing on you.


537
00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:48.739
Yeah. Uh, monica, can I talk
to you about something?


538
00:26:50.576 --> 00:26:51.942
Monica: Yeah.

539
00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:57.881
Um, yesterday I overheard elodie price

540
00:26:57.983 --> 00:27:02.819
being pretty shady about you
and hosting tea time.


541
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:06.423
Wait, what did she say?

542
00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:11.995
She was saying stuff like
you're not any competition,


543
00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:16.099
and she would do anything
to get the show over you.


544
00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:20.303
Uh, okay.

545
00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:25.108
Thank you for telling me.

546
00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:30.313
- Of course.
- I'm your assistant now.


547
00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:32.516
I got your back, always.

548
00:27:44.797 --> 00:27:47.631
- Ooh, mrs. Fletcher.
- You stink.


549
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:02.112
There's a lot of stuff in here...

550
00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:09.386
What?

551
00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:11.588
No way.

552
00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:15.759
Wow.

553
00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:16.694
♪

554
00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:30.040
"when they go low,
we go high."


555
00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:35.644
Michelle obama: Chapter two...

556
00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.552
Uh, ma'am,

557
00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.305
you're interrupting my becoming session.

558
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.755
Becoming what, girl?

559
00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:47.876
Somebody who ain't texted
back their best friend?


560
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.226
No, my new assistant

561
00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:51.446
got me michelle obama's audio book, honey.

562
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.281
You got an assistant that buy you gift?

563
00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:54.998
Sound like my type of girl.

564
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.951
Right? She makes a mean
breakfast, too.


565
00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.702
Bebe: Come again?

566
00:28:58.804 --> 00:29:00.822
Oh, right, I've been meaning to tell you,

567
00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:03.240
my new assistant moved right next door,

568
00:29:03.342 --> 00:29:04.875
in mrs. Fletcher's house.

569
00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:06.810
She came over, you know,

570
00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:08.963
we kind of got to talking and drinking,

571
00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:10.565
and that's all I really can remember,

572
00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:12.826
but she was there
when I woke up, so.

573
00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:16.186
So, your new assistant
spent the night at your house?


574
00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:17.539
You don't think that's

575
00:29:17.623 --> 00:29:19.140
a little bit too work friendly, monica?

576
00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:22.210
She's my new assistant,
not my new best friend, bebe.


577
00:29:22.294 --> 00:29:23.812
I'm not worried about that,

578
00:29:23.896 --> 00:29:25.747
that position been filled for years.

579
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:27.382
I'm just trying to call you
because I got some tea


580
00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:29.651
to tell you about my dating adventures,

581
00:29:29.735 --> 00:29:30.919
but I found someone I like.

582
00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:32.535
Oh, really?

583
00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:34.989
Yes, he's an engineer,
south carolina university,


584
00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:38.842
he's sexy, he's smart,
and he ain't no liar.


585
00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:41.329
And I know, because I did a
background check on him.


586
00:29:41.413 --> 00:29:46.816
- Bebe, a background check?
- Really? Girl, you're crazy.


587
00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.488
I am crazy. That's me.

588
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.409
Do you think that's why I ain't
got me no man, though?


589
00:29:54.493 --> 00:29:57.494
Oh no, no girl, of course not.

590
00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.404
You know, I heard
monica was a tough boss,

591
00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:25.406
but making you stare
at her picture like that?


592
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.557
That's like a whole 'nother level.

593
00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.210
You look good in
this blue, by the way.

594
00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:31.328
Oh, thank you, it's a new dress.

595
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.615
Yeah, well that's definitely your color.

596
00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:34.883
Were you headed somewhere?

597
00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:36.499
I'm actually kind of lost.

598
00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:37.719
Monica's not here yet,

599
00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:40.121
and I don't know where to go
get a good cup of coffee.


600
00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:41.676
Well see, you're in luck,

601
00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:43.191
because I'm in need
of a pick me up.

602
00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:45.593
I'll show you where you can get
the best cup in the building,


603
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.844
- so follow me.
- Okay.


604
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:54.517
- Eric: Come on.
- Miss first day.


605
00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:02.110
- Monica: Andre?
- Please don't hang up!


606
00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:03.878
Look, baby, I won't make any more excuses,

607
00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.662
but just know I...

608
00:31:05.764 --> 00:31:07.448
Baby, I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.


609
00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.827
- Do not call me again.
- Andre: Monica!


610
00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:18.108
- Knock knock.
- I got lunch.


611
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.261
Yeah? Well you can
come on in, then.


612
00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.696
Alright. Where do you want it?

613
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.979
Right here's fine.

614
00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:25.882
Here's your drink that you ordered.

615
00:31:26.785 --> 00:31:28.618
Well, look at you.

616
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.072
Girl, you look stunning.
You are wearing that dress.


617
00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:32.407
- You like it?
- Monica: Yes.


618
00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:33.841
Well, it's from a private collection,

619
00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.944
maybe you've heard of it, chez monica.

620
00:31:36.028 --> 00:31:37.660
Familiar.

621
00:31:37.763 --> 00:31:38.880
Look, it is a long way,

622
00:31:38.964 --> 00:31:40.648
and way nicer than any thrift store

623
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.032
I been to back home.

624
00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:44.185
What part of virginia did you
grow up in, again?


625
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.987
Oh, well see, I tell people richmond,

626
00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:47.922
but I'm really from
like a little pin dot

627
00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.525
next to richmond,
that nobody's ever heard of.


628
00:31:50.609 --> 00:31:52.293
- Okay, alright.
- Born and raised?


629
00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:55.311
Yeah, just me, my mom,
and my grandma, that's it.


630
00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:57.047
What about your father?

631
00:31:58.216 --> 00:32:00.917
- Uh...
- Never met him.


632
00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.303
I'm sorry to hear that, simone.

633
00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:03.653
Oh no, don't be.

634
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.708
You can't really be sad

635
00:32:06.792 --> 00:32:08.910
about somebody you never met, right?

636
00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:11.713
Monica: Daddy the tooth fairy.

637
00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:14.297
- Oh.
- Oh my goodness.


638
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:17.067
Do you know how much I was teased

639
00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:18.686
and how many fights I almost got into

640
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.439
for believing in make believe
for way too long?


641
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:25.675
Well, I hope you don't blame
your father for that.


642
00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:28.845
He just wanted to make you happy.

643
00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:31.165
There's nothing wrong with
somebody caring about you


644
00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:34.484
so much they want
to shield you from the truth.


645
00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:37.387
Yeah, I guess so.

646
00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:40.957
- This is so nice.
- Yeah, it is.


647
00:32:43.195 --> 00:32:44.561
As a matter of fact,

648
00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:46.381
I need some of that shielding right now.

649
00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:48.531
Why? What's the matter?

650
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:53.002
After smiling all up in my face, elodie,

651
00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:55.456
I don't think she's the friend
I thought she was.


652
00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.692
Simone overheard her talking
bad behind my back.


653
00:32:57.776 --> 00:32:59.042
Simone?

654
00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:01.295
Oh yeah, simone, she's my new assistant.

655
00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:05.315
Yeah, the station finally
hired another sister.


656
00:33:05.417 --> 00:33:07.083
- Oh, really?
- Yes, mm-hmm.


657
00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:09.656
She's from some
backwater town in virginia.


658
00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:12.589
Oh, virginia, oh.

659
00:33:12.691 --> 00:33:14.375
Monica: Yes, and
she dresses like a mom.


660
00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:15.843
Oh my goodness, 
I couldn't take it.

661
00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:18.222
I had to give her
some of my old stuff.

662
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:21.698
- Hey, h-town.
- Hey, h-town.


663
00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:30.273
Doesn't like...
If you do it like this...


664
00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:39.649
Oh, like this.

665
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:50.660
This is simone hicks,
and you're watching hey h-town.


666
00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.871
This is simone harris, and
you're watching hey h-town.


667
00:34:05.227 --> 00:34:09.863
♪

668
00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:12.799
Monica, these are for you.

669
00:34:13.668 --> 00:34:15.235
You brought me flowers?

670
00:34:15.337 --> 00:34:17.688
Actually, I ran into your ex downstairs,

671
00:34:17.772 --> 00:34:20.067
and he begged me
to bring those to you.

672
00:34:21.443 --> 00:34:22.827
"I know you don't believe me,

673
00:34:22.911 --> 00:34:25.879
but I'm gonna prove it to you.
Love, andre."


674
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:27.347
Wait.

675
00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:30.268
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!


676
00:34:30.352 --> 00:34:31.869
Those are some beautiful flowers.

677
00:34:31.953 --> 00:34:34.038
Yes, and if anyone else
would've given them to me,


678
00:34:34.122 --> 00:34:35.473
- I would've kept them.
- Really?


679
00:34:35.557 --> 00:34:37.757
- Really.
- Wait right there. Don't...


680
00:34:44.466 --> 00:34:47.600
An exquisite bouquet
for an exquisite lady.


681
00:34:47.702 --> 00:34:49.102
Exquisite?

682
00:34:49.204 --> 00:34:52.438
Oh, you shouldn't have.
For me?


683
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.540
- You're too much.
- No card?


684
00:34:54.643 --> 00:34:57.277
- No card.
- But, I do have a question.


685
00:34:57.379 --> 00:35:00.046
Mm-hmm? Okay.

686
00:35:00.148 --> 00:35:02.248
Would you go out with me?

687
00:35:03.752 --> 00:35:07.654
Now how could I say no to a
guy with such great taste?


688
00:35:07.756 --> 00:35:10.456
Thursday?

689
00:35:11.493 --> 00:35:12.725
Thursday.

690
00:35:13.595 --> 00:35:15.228
Thank you.

691
00:35:18.466 --> 00:35:19.799
There you two are.

692
00:35:19.901 --> 00:35:21.935
So, got somebody here

693
00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:24.021
who wants to have
a word with you both.

694
00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:26.306
- Hi ladies.
- I got this, jeff.


695
00:35:26.408 --> 00:35:28.174
I know you do.

696
00:35:29.744 --> 00:35:32.630
I'm not naive enough to
believe that I have any say


697
00:35:32.714 --> 00:35:34.714
in who's going to replace me,

698
00:35:34.816 --> 00:35:36.667
but I wanted to
have a little face time

699
00:35:36.751 --> 00:35:39.222
with the two women who
are vying to do so.

700
00:35:40.221 --> 00:35:42.755
Well, you're irreplaceable,
ms. Rochelle.


701
00:35:42.857 --> 00:35:44.090
I like you.

702
00:35:44.192 --> 00:35:45.892
Well, luckily for me,

703
00:35:45.994 --> 00:35:48.828
when monica was
recently out on vacation...


704
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.664
Vacation? I was grieving my
father's death.


705
00:35:51.766 --> 00:35:53.166
The viewers got a taste

706
00:35:53.268 --> 00:35:55.353
of how I would and could
carry a show on my own.


707
00:35:55.437 --> 00:35:58.155
Tea time with elodie price
has a distinct ring to it,


708
00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.639
don't you agree?

709
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:03.009
No more distinct than
tea time with monica harris.


710
00:36:03.111 --> 00:36:06.612
This feistiness between the two of you,

711
00:36:06.715 --> 00:36:08.081
it'll serve you well.

712
00:36:08.183 --> 00:36:12.251
I wish both of you luck,
and may the best woman win.


713
00:36:12.354 --> 00:36:14.707
- Elodie: Thank you.
- Monica: Thank you.


714
00:36:17.726 --> 00:36:19.010
Have you lost your mind?

715
00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:22.762
What the hell was that, elodie?
What happened to our promise?


716
00:36:22.864 --> 00:36:24.949
Oh girl, that was just some fun shade.

717
00:36:25.033 --> 00:36:26.684
Friendly banter between two friends.

718
00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:28.101
Friendly banter?

719
00:36:28.203 --> 00:36:30.922
You called me grieving my
father's death a vacation.


720
00:36:31.006 --> 00:36:33.324
Please, it was just a little dig, monica.

721
00:36:33.408 --> 00:36:34.774
Don't be so sensitive.

722
00:36:34.876 --> 00:36:36.260
Only one of us is
going to get that job,

723
00:36:36.344 --> 00:36:37.395
and we can't always play nice.

724
00:36:37.479 --> 00:36:38.678
Yeah, obviously not.

725
00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.331
Elodie: You really need
to toughen up.


726
00:36:40.415 --> 00:36:41.799
You'll be better off if you just admit

727
00:36:41.883 --> 00:36:43.868
you don't have
what it takes to do the job.


728
00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:45.651
Okay.

729
00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:52.625
Okay.

730
00:37:16.017 --> 00:37:17.683
Bebe: The party is here!

731
00:37:17.786 --> 00:37:21.487
I got me a bottle, 
I got you a bottle.

732
00:37:23.458 --> 00:37:25.024
I didn't get you a bottle.

733
00:37:26.194 --> 00:37:29.829
I didn't know you were here.
Thought it was just us today.


734
00:37:29.931 --> 00:37:32.932
Okay, well, you know
simone is new to town

735
00:37:33.034 --> 00:37:34.885
and she doesn't have any friends,

736
00:37:34.969 --> 00:37:38.905
so I figured she should join us,
alright? Right.


737
00:37:39.007 --> 00:37:41.174
Monica said that you wouldn't mind.

738
00:37:41.276 --> 00:37:44.710
- Monica: Yeah.
- If you said that now, okay.


739
00:37:44.813 --> 00:37:47.480
I'll take these.

740
00:37:48.216 --> 00:37:49.949
Thank you.

741
00:37:52.387 --> 00:37:55.655
- I heard so much about you.
- Likewise.


742
00:37:57.759 --> 00:37:59.977
I am so happy that
the women in my life

743
00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:01.594
are finally together.

744
00:38:04.265 --> 00:38:06.432
That didn't sound right.

745
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:08.534
Ooh, alright guys.

746
00:38:08.636 --> 00:38:11.571
The wine is almost gone, who's thirsty?

747
00:38:11.673 --> 00:38:14.107
Besides you?

748
00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:18.335
Yeah. You know, mon' said that
you were really funny.


749
00:38:19.147 --> 00:38:20.813
Mon' said I was funny?

750
00:38:20.915 --> 00:38:22.982
Monica: Alright,
let's go outside.


751
00:38:24.619 --> 00:38:25.669
So, what do you think

752
00:38:25.753 --> 00:38:27.787
about the whole elodie situation?

753
00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:28.973
What elodie situation?

754
00:38:29.057 --> 00:38:30.423
Okay, so simone thinks

755
00:38:30.525 --> 00:38:32.825
elodie has it out for me at work.

756
00:38:32.927 --> 00:38:35.061
No, not thinks, knows.

757
00:38:35.163 --> 00:38:36.547
Monica: No,
I just think it's elodie


758
00:38:36.631 --> 00:38:39.732
being a little
overly ambitious, that's all.


759
00:38:39.834 --> 00:38:41.234
I trust you.

760
00:38:41.336 --> 00:38:43.521
I know you can handle
your own, keep it cute.


761
00:38:43.605 --> 00:38:45.271
Hmm.

762
00:38:45.373 --> 00:38:48.359
I mean, but isn't that the point
of having girlfriends?


763
00:38:48.443 --> 00:38:50.795
So you don't have to handle
things on your own?


764
00:38:50.879 --> 00:38:53.030
When exactly does
ms. Fletcher come home?


765
00:38:53.114 --> 00:38:54.999
You know, that is a good question though,

766
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:56.616
where is ms. Fletcher?

767
00:38:56.718 --> 00:39:00.987
- Um, texted me today.
- Ms. Fletcher? Text you?


768
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:04.390
Yes. She said she was
extending her trip.


769
00:39:04.492 --> 00:39:06.792
- Where?
- I don't know, bebe.


770
00:39:06.895 --> 00:39:08.746
I was taught to mind my own business.

771
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.515
I find that when you get into
other people's business,


772
00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:12.817
you get into some trouble.

773
00:39:12.901 --> 00:39:14.433
And you know what I find?

774
00:39:14.536 --> 00:39:16.720
That when people run they mouth too much,

775
00:39:16.804 --> 00:39:18.804
they cause trouble.

776
00:39:18.907 --> 00:39:22.208
Or people who date their
friend's old ass uncles,


777
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.494
because they can't find love.

778
00:39:23.578 --> 00:39:25.278
No she didn't.

779
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.064
Monica: Okay, alright,
it's time to wrap this up.


780
00:39:27.148 --> 00:39:28.866
I think we've had too much to drink.

781
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.584
Thank you.
Thank you, simone.


782
00:39:31.686 --> 00:39:33.686
- We can wrap it up.
- Alright.


783
00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:35.339
Bebe: Yeah,
that's a good idea, bye.


784
00:39:35.423 --> 00:39:36.774
We don't need that, either.

785
00:39:36.858 --> 00:39:39.192
Good night, monica, see you tomorrow.

786
00:39:39.294 --> 00:39:41.627
Goodnight. Goodnight.

787
00:39:43.865 --> 00:39:46.484
Okay, I may have said something

So wait, you think simone did this?

793
00:40:32.413 --> 00:40:34.899
I don't think she did it,
I know she did it.

Hm, interesting, that's exactly

about you in high school.

No, I'm good crazy, you know?

Big difference.

Oh.

Okay. Strong possibility
I did that, okay?

Mm-hmm.

805
00:41:11.919 --> 00:41:14.954
But being serious, 
I don't trust her.

806
00:41:16.457 --> 00:41:19.225
She's like creepy.
The way she looks at you...


807
00:41:19.327 --> 00:41:21.111
- Be, you're overreacting.
- No, I'm not,

00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:27.718
before you sage her out of our lives.

812
00:41:27.802 --> 00:41:29.835
Alright. For you?

813
00:41:29.937 --> 00:41:32.238
But if she kill me, 
I'm killing you.

What is that?

815

Well, you was out of sage, so
I used lawry's seasoning


816

that was good on everything.

What? Is she okay?

823

- She's beat up pretty bad.
- Oh my god, that is terrible.

Yo, first...

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:16.161
Bebe: All done!

966
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:17.396
My signature.

967
00:50:17.498 --> 00:50:19.015
Bebe: Yes, you look beautiful.

968
00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:20.150
So check this out,

969
00:50:20.234 --> 00:50:22.768
I did some digging on your girl, simone.

970
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:25.355
- You googled the girl?
- I Google everybody.


971
00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:26.490
You should be googling everybody, too,

972
00:50:26.574 --> 00:50:27.758
all these random people around,

973
00:50:27.842 --> 00:50:29.559
you need to tighten up your game.

974
00:50:29.643 --> 00:50:32.411
So wait, my game is not tight
because I choose


975
00:50:32.513 --> 00:50:34.464
to get to know
people before I judge them?

976
00:50:34.548 --> 00:50:36.199
This girl's all in your business,

977
00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:37.968
you don't even know the damn girl.

978
00:50:38.052 --> 00:50:39.603
Is she on, like, some single white female,

979
00:50:39.687 --> 00:50:42.855
or in our case, single black
female, type shit?


980
00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:44.456
Jeff hired her.

981
00:50:44.558 --> 00:50:46.058
And if he hired her,

982
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.844
I'm sure a background check was done,

983
00:50:47.928 --> 00:50:50.762
simone is good people, and I trust her.

984

but you know what you can do?


990

Do your own little lip stain.

991
00:51:07.214 --> 00:51:08.899
Handle you, handle your own life,

992

I mean, they didn't have any proof,

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.705

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.179
So, you wouldn't let met
explain back in your office,


1260
01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:46.827
I didn't have sex
with andre to hurt you.

1261
01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:52.660
I did it so you'd know that
he's not good enough for you.


1262
01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:57.022
And that idiot had
to show up to your apartment


1263
01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:59.773
with the dvd and...

1264
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:03.511
I had no choice but
to take care of him.

1265
01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:08.852
Just like I took care
of mrs. Fletcher.


1266
01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:15.155
And elodie, that backstabbing bitch.

1267
01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.925
Monica...

1268
01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:20.679
You've really got to be more careful

1269
01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:22.763
about who you let in your life.

1270
01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.601
Bebe: Monica,
where are you?


1271
01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:30.638
Monica? Are you here?
Monica!


1272
01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.073
Monica!

1273
01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:43.617
God, I wanted a room like this
when I was growing up.


1274
01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:49.123
Nothing like mine, let me tell you that.

1275
01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:52.343
But you can tell a lot about a
person from their room.


1276
01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:59.300
Oh, see, take this picture for example.

1277
01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:01.268
See, this picture,

1278
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:05.639
this tells me that you
came from a loving family,


1279
01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:09.410
parents that loved you.
Aw.


1280
01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:16.016
Aw, look at this.
See, this tells me


1281
01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.752
that you were taught to love yourself,

1282
01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:20.502
and the skin that you're in.

1283
01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:24.858
Gross.

1284
01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:37.037
Come on. Monica, pick up.

1285
01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:45.679
Simone: Bye, bebe.

1286
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.034
- Simone: What?
- Why are you doing this?


1287
01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:52.419
- Seriously?
- You haven't figured it out?


1288
01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:56.657
- Figured out what?
- What is going on?


1289
01:14:56.759 --> 01:14:59.760
Damn, you really don't know.

1290
01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:01.713
You know, I would say,
"let's ask your mother,"


1291
01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:04.098
but that bitch is dead to me.

1292
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.367
Simone!

1293
01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:09.903
Ew! Ew!
I'm coming in.


1294
01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:12.858
What did you do to my mother?

1295
01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:15.648
Where is my mother?
Where is my mother, simone?


1296
01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:22.182
Oh, god.

1297
01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.258
Relax!

1298
01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.933
- Mom!
- Alright, that's enough.


1299
01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:44.038
Monica: Mom!

1300
01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.706
- No!
- Yes.


1301
01:15:45.808 --> 01:15:48.876
That's enough of that.
Enough of that.


1302
01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.746
You know monica, you know
what I can appreciate?


1303
01:15:56.652 --> 01:16:00.421
I can always appreciate
your family dynamic.


1304
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:05.125
You guys would do anything for each other.

1305
01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:08.495
Yeah, I never had that growing up.

1306
01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:10.931
Nobody ever chooses me.

1307
01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:15.002
I blamed your mother, 
I blame my mother,

1308
01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:17.771
but you know who I blame the most?

1309
01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:21.141
Our father.

1310
01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:27.833
Sorry bebe, monica can't come
to the phone right now,


1311
01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.249
she's with family.

1312
01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:33.153
Simone! I swear,
if you touch her,


1313
01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.788
I'ma beat your ass.

1314
01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.241
Simone: You
ain't gonna do shit!


1315
01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:39.460
'Cause if you were, you'd
already be here, bff.


1316
01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:45.432
I got you. Chimes!

1317
01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:49.021
I really thought things

1318
01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.105
would be different for us, monica.

1319
01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.512
I thought his death would bring us closer.

1320
01:16:55.578 --> 01:16:58.812
But if I can't have
my dream family in life,


1321
01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:02.739
then we'll all just
have to be together in death.


1322
01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:10.457
Why hello, mrs. Fletcher.
I'll take that.


1323
01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:15.562
Formaldehyde.

1324
01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.573
Monica, what?

1325
01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:30.811
Simone, I didn't know.

1326
01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.668
I wish I would've known we were sisters.

1327
01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:41.121
I would've chosen you over everybody.

1328
01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:45.559
It's not too late.

1329
01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:49.730
I could still choose you.

1330
01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.932
- Really?
- Really.


1331
01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:59.139
Now, can you please tell me
about your mom and our father?


1332
01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:01.842
Because I don't know. I don't.

1333
01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:11.785
They met on his, uh, first
campaign. You were just born.


1334
01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:16.641
And they were
working together out in d.C.


1335
01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:19.359
My mother said
they only slept together once,


1336
01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:23.230
but that's all it took to have me.

1337
01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:26.077
Simone: You know, they paid
her a lot of money


1338
01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:28.795
to keep me a secret.

1339
01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:30.530
Didn't they, denise?

1340
01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:34.334
Didn't they, denise?

1341
01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.473
On the anniversary of her death,

1342
01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:42.576
he called out of the blue,

1343
01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:44.878
said that he wanted to meet up.

1344
01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:50.417
I couldn't believe
I was finally meeting him.


1345
01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:59.226
And he was everything
I always imagined he'd be.


1346
01:19:59.328 --> 01:20:03.630
He was handsome, and nice,
and funny and smart.


1347
01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:06.400
The perfect dad.
Just like you said.


1348
01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:10.755
He said he was sorry about not
being there for me


1349
01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.673
when my mom died.

1350
01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:14.908
Wished he could make it up to me.

1351
01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.979
I told him he could,
that we could be a family now.


1352
01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:20.781
And you know what he said?

1353
01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:22.701
Me coming into y'all's lives now

1354
01:20:22.785 --> 01:20:26.453
would be bad for your reputation.

1355
01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:30.123
So when he wasn't looking, 
I got payback.

1356
01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:41.201
He broke my heart, so I stopped his.

1357
01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:48.575
You probably hate me now.

1358

Monica: Simone, simone,
no, I don't blame you.


1359

We can fix this.
