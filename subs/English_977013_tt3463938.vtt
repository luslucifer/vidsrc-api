Last one there
goes to prison!


2
00:01:24.473 --> 00:01:25.974
Wait, that's not fair.
Wait for me!


3
00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:27.642
I said if you want to
see a clattering engine,


4
00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:29.644
stop by the Commons
on the first Friday
of the month.


5
00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:33.356
What do you
think is?


6
00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:35.025
Might just be a drill.

7
00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:36.610
- Very strange,
don't you think?
- Haven't you heard?


8
00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:37.861
Heard what?

9
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:39.070
A rupture of some sort
in the engine.


10
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.280
Oh, here comes someone.

11
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.907
Excuse me,
where do you think he's going?


12
00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:42.949
Hello?

13
00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:56.713
Take one, keep moving please.

14
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.799
Take one.

15
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.133
- Did you say this way?
- Everything will be fine.


16
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.385
Upstairs and turn left.

17
00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:02.928
I don't like this madness.

18
00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:05.764
Are we sinking?
No.
Upstairs, turn left.


19
00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:06.807
Everything will be fine.

20
00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:08.391
Just continue upstairs,
please.


21
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:09.600
Keep moving, please.

22
00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:11.603
Sir, keep moving, please.

23
00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.021
There you go, Sir.

24
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:14.940
Are there at least enough
lifeboats this time?


25
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.608
Keep calm, go upstairs please.

26
00:02:28.954 --> 00:02:30.372
Hello?

27
00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:35.544
Mrs Ratch?

28
00:02:49.057 --> 00:02:51.018
The porter found her
twenty minutes ago.


29
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:52.394
And?

30
00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.396
Apparently, her husband
used an axe.


31
00:02:54.438 --> 00:02:55.896
Oh my God.

32
00:02:56.106 --> 00:02:58.942
The lunatic
hasn't stopped
whistling since he got here.


33
00:02:59.943 --> 00:03:01.403
The little girl?

34
00:03:01.403 --> 00:03:02.738
We're still looking.

Stop worrying. Apparently
Mrs Howe's weak stomach


63
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.446
caused her so much upset,

That's a terrible name.

I was fine in
third class dining.


70
00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:43.208
I wasn't.

71
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.085
-Were you?
-Mm-hmm.


72
00:06:45.752 --> 00:06:47.462
Oh, what does
a seven-year-old know?

-Eight!
-Really?


74
00:06:48.964 --> 00:06:50.424
Have you any idea
what will happen


75
00:06:50.424 --> 00:06:52.592

Thank you.

77
00:06:58.515 --> 00:07:01.643
We, err, reserved
a table.
The name is Howe.


78
00:07:01.643 --> 00:07:03.020
William Howe?

79
00:07:03.437 --> 00:07:05.272
Ah, yes. Er, you cancelled.

80
00:07:05.272 --> 00:07:06.857
Well, we're here now.

81
00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:08.442
That table is no longer
available.


82
00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:10.819
I'm sorry, Mr Howe.

83
00:07:11.653 --> 00:07:13.822
And it was for two guests, only.

84
00:07:13.822 --> 00:07:15.949
Captain...Howe.

85
00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:17.951
Army, Sir?

86
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.455
Infantry. Northern Ireland.

87
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.167
Did you serve?

88
00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:28.420
Royal engineers. Palestine.

89
00:07:30.338 --> 00:07:32.257
Oh, bugger.

90
00:07:33.467 --> 00:07:34.718
Blasted lighter.

91
00:07:34.718 --> 00:07:36.678
Could have sworn I brought it
with me.


92
00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:48.940
Well...Captain Howe.

93
00:07:49.566 --> 00:07:51.568
Shall we see about that table?

94
00:07:55.822 --> 00:07:57.240
Happy Halloween!

95
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.910
And boy, oh, boy, have
we got a show
or you tonight!


96
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.787
So, come and join us
on the dance floor


97
00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:03.872
and let's 'raise some spirits'!

98
00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:17.511
This is you, Sir.

99
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:21.848
Ah, perhaps you have something
a little more...


100
00:08:22.265 --> 00:08:24.476
central, for an old army pal?

101
00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:26.186
My usual table.

102
00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:36.570
Reserved, I'm afraid.

103
00:08:37.906 --> 00:08:39.449
Typical army engineer.

104
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.661
Technically correct,
but of no use to anyone.


105
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:44.538
Enjoy your evening, Sir.

106
00:08:44.538 --> 00:08:45.831
Oh, fuck off.

107
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:47.582
Darling, please.

110
00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:53.839
Made the one about a couple who
have a child out of wedlock,


111
00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:55.841
with hilarious consequences.

112
00:08:55.841 --> 00:08:58.468
One Up, One Down?
-Yeah, yeah.
Quite liked it.


113
00:08:58.969 --> 00:09:01.221
Heard he was in London
making a picture
with Fred Astaire.


114
00:09:01.221 --> 00:09:02.180
Really?

115
00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:04.433
I should go over
and introduce myself.


116
00:09:04.433 --> 00:09:05.392
-No.
-No.


117
00:09:05.392 --> 00:09:06.435
You always say,

118
00:09:06.435 --> 00:09:08.770
"If an opportunity comes along,
grab it."


119
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.605
Yeah, I do, but never beg.

120
00:09:10.605 --> 00:09:12.858
Opportunity is slippery.

121
00:09:12.858 --> 00:09:15.861
It's like trying to catch a fish
with bare hands.


122
00:09:15.861 --> 00:09:18.780
The trick is to wait
and let it come to you,


123
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.365
then when it gets close...

124
00:09:20.365 --> 00:09:21.992
...grab it!

125
00:09:21.992 --> 00:09:23.410
And don't let it go,

126
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.704
no matter how much it begs
and tries to slip away.


127
00:09:26.204 --> 00:09:27.497
Hold on tight.

128
00:09:28.707 --> 00:09:31.168
And don't be afraid
to get your hands dirty.


129
00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:32.753
How long must I wait?

Er, I'm not sure that's

Yep.
Feels that way.

00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:41.446
He might as well
live in a different country.


158

Well, it's kind of appropriate,
then,

-Or a different continent.
-Honey, you're being

00:10:49.955 --> 00:10:51.206
You just needed time

00:10:57.379 --> 00:10:58.797
-Nothing.
-I told you,


165
00:10:58.797 --> 00:11:00.090
those kids don't know
what they're talking about.


166
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.258
That is why they're kids.

167
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:03.844
Do you believe them?

168
00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:06.555
Then you are just as stupid
as they are.


169
00:11:06.763 --> 00:11:09.641
-No, I'm not!
No, you're not. You're not.


170
00:11:13.603 --> 00:11:17.566

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:27.242

182
00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:04.863
Okay.

183
00:12:05.489 --> 00:12:07.616
Go do some of that
ghost hunting, honey.


184
00:12:47.364 --> 00:12:48.824
For thirty-one years,

185
00:12:48.824 --> 00:12:51.743
the Queen Mary served
as a majestic city of the sea.


186
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.955
Now she's dropped anchor
for the final time.


187
00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:56.373
Closing out a career

188
00:12:56.373 --> 00:12:59.668
unequalled in the history of
commercial sea voyaging.


189
00:12:59.668 --> 00:13:01.712
A career that took her
through a depression,


190
00:13:01.712 --> 00:13:05.215
a world war,
a period of unequalled glory,


191
00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:06.967
and a last great voyage.

192
00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:09.553
Well, I would describe
this Queen Mary's
the most elegant


193
00:13:09.553 --> 00:13:12.931
and the finest ship that has
ever sailed any of the oceans.


194
00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:15.308
The saddest
thing is,
I think, to ever happen


195
00:13:15.308 --> 00:13:18.770
because this has got to
be one of the most
beautiful ships that was, er...


196
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.147
anyone's ever built.

197
00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:24.484
We feel that The Queen Mary
will be sort of


198
00:13:24.484 --> 00:13:27.487
the crown jewel in what
we hope will be


199
00:13:27.487 --> 00:13:32.284
the foremost water recreation
development in the entire
United States.


200
00:13:32.284 --> 00:13:35.495
Their predictions
are as high as
two and a half million
people a year


201
00:13:35.495 --> 00:13:40.250
will be coming down
to visit and board
The Queen Mary for its
various activities.


202
00:13:42.794 --> 00:13:47.090
The quality of the work
and the story that you
tell, the pictures,


203
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.177
that's all very...quality,
the quality...


204
00:13:50.886 --> 00:13:53.095
-Dad! Dad!
-Hey, son!


205
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.223
I have missed you.

206
00:13:55.223 --> 00:13:56.350
Me too!

207
00:13:57.017 --> 00:14:00.145
-Hi, Patrick.
-Hey...Anne.


208
00:14:00.562 --> 00:14:01.730
Glad you made it,

209
00:14:01.938 --> 00:14:03.482
although you are a little late,
but that's fine.


210
00:14:03.482 --> 00:14:05.275
-Sorry.
-I rung ahead, let them know.


211
00:14:05.442 --> 00:14:06.902
You wanna go through it again,
or...?


212
00:14:07.402 --> 00:14:08.445
-The pitch?
-Yeah.


213
00:14:09.154 --> 00:14:10.655
Um, I'm good if you are?

214
00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:13.367
I'm, I'm good.
-Er, well, although, er...


215
00:14:13.658 --> 00:14:17.162
the publisher thinks a more
holistic approach is needed.


216
00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:22.959
Um, books, website, 3D tour?

217
00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:25.003
Guests have reported

218
00:14:25.003 --> 00:14:26.755
seeing a woman in white,
playing piano.


219
00:14:26.755 --> 00:14:29.216
A war bride, who,
after learning her husband died


220
00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:31.635
serving in France,
took her own life.


221
00:14:32.386 --> 00:14:35.389
You can pick up a
limited-edition
doll
of the woman in white


222
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:37.224
in the gift shop
on your way out.


223
00:14:37.516 --> 00:14:41.311
Next, we'll see where
Fred Astaire
once danced the cha cha.


224
00:14:41.311 --> 00:14:44.564
I'm half expecting Fred Astaire
to jump out and try
sell me a hoover.


225
00:14:44.564 --> 00:14:46.858
-So, what's this
about a 3D tour?
-Oh, sorry.


226
00:14:47.317 --> 00:14:49.236
Er, you know, I just thought
you could mention it to him.


227
00:14:49.236 --> 00:14:50.904
It, it's a
big thing to just
mention.


228
00:14:50.904 --> 00:14:51.905
There are no visuals,
no concept work.


229
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.907
Besides we've been
through this...
-Hey, uh...


230
00:14:53.907 --> 00:14:55.492
-...the ship's almost

231
00:14:55.492 --> 00:14:56.952
- It deserves
something...
- I'm thirsty.


232
00:14:56.952 --> 00:14:58.453
...you can feel and touch.
Something that lasts.


233
00:14:58.453 --> 00:14:59.538
- Can I get a frappe?
- Er, sure.


234
00:14:59.538 --> 00:15:00.872
No, honey.
Who lets a kid drink coffee?


235
00:15:00.872 --> 00:15:02.374
- Oh, come on!
- Fine.


236
00:15:02.374 --> 00:15:03.542
Hang on,
I'll give you water.


237
00:15:03.542 --> 00:15:04.501
Oh, forget it.

238
00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:05.836
With or without all this.

239
00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:07.546
But, er, you don't agree?

240
00:15:07.546 --> 00:15:09.840
No, I do, I do.
I think you're incredibly noble.


241
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.466
-Well, thank you.
-And righteous.


242
00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:13.093
-Yeah, keep going.
-And have amazing intentions.


243
00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:15.137
I feel like the idea
is a little dated.


244
00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:16.471
I don't know what a book
is gonna do


245
00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:17.764
to save The Queen Mary.

246
00:15:17.848 --> 00:15:19.641
Get your God damn
freaking hands off me!


247
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.272
If I catch you sneaking
in here one more time,


248
00:15:25.272 --> 00:15:27.482
I swear to God,
I'll crack your head open.


249
00:15:27.482 --> 00:15:29.151
So, I've been published
three times.


250
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:31.069
Oh, we're counting
academic papers now?


251
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:32.654
All warmly received.

252
00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:39.661
Welcome to L.A.

253
00:15:39.661 --> 00:15:40.954
These days.

254
00:15:41.163 --> 00:15:42.831
So, what do you think?

255
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:45.000
Look, isn't
the real reason
you wanted to work on this...


256
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.585
so you can spend time with...

257
00:15:49.004 --> 00:15:50.172
Hey, buddy.

258
00:15:50.172 --> 00:15:51.673
Huh? Yeah?

259
00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:55.135
Er...you wanna go on the
haunted tour


260
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:57.345
while your mom has her
boring meeting?


261
00:15:58.555 --> 00:15:59.639
Yeah!

262
00:16:01.058 --> 00:16:02.601
-Good luck.
-Thank you.


263
00:16:03.727 --> 00:16:04.770
Yeah.

264
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.772
-Come on.
-Bye, Mom!


265
00:16:10.567 --> 00:16:11.526
I'll be fine.

- Captain.
- Oh, Gibson.


283
00:17:25.475 --> 00:17:26.727
I've looked at your proposal.

284
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.770
-Oh, right.
-Let's be clear,


285
00:17:28.895 --> 00:17:31.231
we're on the world's
fastest ocean liner.


286
00:17:31.815 --> 00:17:35.193
And all you're thinking about
is how to make us go faster.


287
00:17:36.194 --> 00:17:37.612
I like it.
-Yes, Sir, about that...


288
00:17:37.612 --> 00:17:38.989
-Passengers travel
on The Queen Mary


289
00:17:39.448 --> 00:17:41.908
because of two words,
Blue Riband.


290
00:17:42.534 --> 00:17:45.328
Not just an award for fastest
transatlantic crossing,


291
00:17:45.328 --> 00:17:46.663
but a guarantee.

292
00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.457
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Captain.


293
00:17:48.582 --> 00:17:51.626
So, if our rivals
want the title of
world's fastest,


294
00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:54.963
well, fuel consumption
is the new battle ground.


295
00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:56.715
Not propulsion.

296
00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.761
Slow? Gibson, why haven't you
rung off full ahead?


297
00:18:00.969 --> 00:18:03.680
Yes, Sir, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.


298
00:18:04.097 --> 00:18:06.141
Standing
still would mean


299
00:18:06.141 --> 00:18:09.019
almost certain death
for a project of this magnitude.


300
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.857
So, when the Great
Depression halted
construction for over a year,


301
00:18:13.857 --> 00:18:14.941
a deal was struck

302
00:18:15.067 --> 00:18:18.153
for Cunard to merge
with White Star Line.


303
00:18:18.487 --> 00:18:21.114
Owners of the ill-fated Titanic.

304
00:18:21.531 --> 00:18:24.534
Creating Cunard White Star.

305
00:18:25.327 --> 00:18:29.247
Steam was generated
in massive furnaces,


306
00:18:29.498 --> 00:18:34.503
superheated and passed to engine
at seven-hundred degrees
Fahrenheit.


307
00:18:34.503 --> 00:18:38.048
About four-hundred
pound per square inch. Phew!


308
00:18:38.298 --> 00:18:40.509
Now, I don't mean
to scare y'all,


309
00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:45.222
but this was the scene of an
accident in 1938,


310
00:18:45.222 --> 00:18:47.974
when steam built up
behind an emergency door,


311
00:18:48.141 --> 00:18:50.394
escaped, killing an engineer...

312
00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:52.270
...shutting down
the main engine.


313
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.441
Guests have since reported
hearing his haunting scream...


314
00:18:56.692 --> 00:18:58.110
-Dad!
...throughout the ship.


315
00:18:58.235 --> 00:18:59.486
Hey, Dad!

316
00:19:00.904 --> 00:19:02.948
Dad!

317
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.239
Dad!

318
00:19:45.699 --> 00:19:47.409
She survived
head on collisions,


319
00:19:47.409 --> 00:19:51.538
Hitler's relentless
wolf packs and even
a one-hundred-foot rogue wave,


320
00:19:51.538 --> 00:19:54.166
causing many to believe
her blessed.


321
00:20:10.515 --> 00:20:11.683
Mrs Calder?

322
00:20:17.314 --> 00:20:18.815
Mrs Calder.

323
00:20:19.566 --> 00:20:21.985
-Miss.
-Oh, Miss Calder.


324
00:20:21.985 --> 00:20:24.321
Yes, yes. Hello, hello.

325
00:20:24.321 --> 00:20:25.739
Um, Mr Torres?

326
00:20:25.739 --> 00:20:27.824
Er, no, er, Charles Bittner.

327
00:20:30.702 --> 00:20:31.828
Are you the historian?

328
00:20:31.828 --> 00:20:34.414
I'm our, er, humble Captain.

329
00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:40.629
I work directly with Mr Torres,
our historian. You were delayed?


330
00:20:41.338 --> 00:20:43.131
He asked if I'd fill in.

331
00:20:43.131 --> 00:20:44.674
Oh, please.

332
00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:48.929
Shit.

333
00:21:01.441 --> 00:21:02.609
Hello?

334
00:21:50.866 --> 00:21:51.992
Pipes started shaking,

335
00:21:51.992 --> 00:21:53.243
so I reduced the speed.

336
00:21:53.243 --> 00:21:55.037
-And?
-Problem's coming from in there.


337
00:21:57.164 --> 00:21:58.290
It's hot to the touch.

338
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.000
I wouldn't venture in there.

339
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.878
My guess is cracked steam pipes
and a cocktail of
superheated oil.


340
00:22:02.878 --> 00:22:05.088
That room is probably

341
00:22:05.088 --> 00:22:06.423
We need to shut her
down, Captain.


342
00:22:06.423 --> 00:22:07.674
Let the engineers do their work.

343
00:22:07.674 --> 00:22:08.884
No.

344
00:22:08.884 --> 00:22:10.510
Reduce speed to 15 knots.

345
00:22:10.635 --> 00:22:14.097
-Captain, it only takes
a spark from...
- All that clatter down here,


346
00:22:14.097 --> 00:22:15.849
you must've lost your hearing.

347
00:22:16.016 --> 00:22:18.435
I said do not stop.

348
00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:21.271
By all means, find
a way to reduce
the pressure and speed.


349
00:22:21.271 --> 00:22:22.314
Gradually.

350
00:22:22.314 --> 00:22:24.149
But do not stop.

351
00:22:24.691 --> 00:22:28.403
And the next time you decide
to slow my ship without
my consent,


352
00:22:28.904 --> 00:22:30.447
I'll leave you at
the nearest port.


353
00:22:30.447 --> 00:22:31.615
Yes, Captain.

354
00:23:12.489 --> 00:23:13.448
H-hello?

355
00:23:37.264 --> 00:23:39.683
Are you lost?

356
00:23:40.809 --> 00:23:41.935
How old are you?

357
00:23:42.686 --> 00:23:43.645
Eight.

358
00:23:44.563 --> 00:23:45.564
Me too.

359
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:12.591
Hello?

360
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.134
Down here.

361
00:24:37.115 --> 00:24:39.076
I didn't know there still was
a ship's Captain.


362
00:24:39.076 --> 00:24:41.661
There is not.
But don't tell anyone.


363
00:24:44.247 --> 00:24:46.124
I just like the suit.

364
00:24:46.124 --> 00:24:50.003
So, why a book about
us, exactly?


365
00:24:50.003 --> 00:24:51.755
I am a digital marketing
consultant...


366
00:24:51.755 --> 00:24:53.173
and my...

367
00:24:53.173 --> 00:24:55.133
...my son is obsessed
with ghost stories.


368
00:24:55.133 --> 00:24:57.135
A little too obsessed
actually and...


369
00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.970
Bittner, are you there?

370
00:24:59.262 --> 00:25:01.014
Well, er, one day
he has this dream
and he says to me,


371
00:25:01.014 --> 00:25:03.100
"Mom, I had a dream
that I was on The Queen Mary."


372
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.060
And I was like,
"Oh, you know, we
should go visit."


373
00:25:05.435 --> 00:25:08.522
And he said,
"No, I had a dream
we lived there."


374
00:25:11.358 --> 00:25:12.442
Not kidding.

375
00:25:12.818 --> 00:25:14.569
And so, you know, it
got me thinking,


376
00:25:14.736 --> 00:25:18.365
um, what about doing a book
from a child's perspective?


377
00:25:18.365 --> 00:25:22.285
-Hmm.
-Exploring the ship
and some of the...


378
00:25:23.495 --> 00:25:24.830
stranger stories.

379
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.375
-Ghost stories?
-Yes, the ghost stories.


380
00:25:29.793 --> 00:25:32.838
And also explore the
ship's rich history


381
00:25:32.838 --> 00:25:35.799
and we could raise awareness
and we could help save it.


382
00:25:38.176 --> 00:25:40.178
I didn't know we needed saving.

383
00:25:41.138 --> 00:25:42.639
Just what I see in the media.

384
00:25:44.766 --> 00:25:45.809
Stories.

385
00:25:46.184 --> 00:25:47.602
Right. Stories.

386
00:25:51.148 --> 00:25:53.275
You know, we're pretty
used to stories
around here,


387
00:25:53.275 --> 00:25:57.571
I mean, people have said we're
a doorway for the dead.


388
00:25:57.571 --> 00:26:00.407
And although we're famous
for our fiction,


389
00:26:00.407 --> 00:26:03.201
you know, sometimes facts
can be much stranger.


390
00:26:05.328 --> 00:26:10.917
Did you know in 1942, while, er,
transporting German and
Italian prisoners,


391
00:26:11.293 --> 00:26:13.795
she collided with one of our own
escort ships?


392
00:26:13.962 --> 00:26:18.633
Sank it.
Killing all but 99 of
its 400 sailors.


393
00:26:19.259 --> 00:26:23.555
And she just continued on
with little more than a scratch.


394
00:26:24.806 --> 00:26:26.308
Would you take me on a tour?

395
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.819
Beautiful.

396
00:26:37.819 --> 00:26:40.864
Oh, yes, we have exactly
five hundred and ninety-six
working clocks


397
00:26:40.864 --> 00:26:41.907
aboard The Queen Mary.

398
00:26:41.907 --> 00:26:44.659
Wow. Really is a time
machine in here.


399
00:26:45.744 --> 00:26:47.829
We should definitely get
all these details in the book.


400
00:26:47.829 --> 00:26:50.248
Well, the Queen's Salon
was a social hub at night.


401
00:26:50.248 --> 00:26:51.833
Winston Churchill used
to sit over there,


402
00:26:51.833 --> 00:26:53.835
Alfred Hitchcock drank
his martini there,


403
00:26:53.835 --> 00:26:55.879
and Bob Hope wrote his
column over there.


404
00:26:56.296 --> 00:26:57.672
Tourists, they love that.

405
00:26:57.672 --> 00:26:59.925
You know, knowing what
famous people did,


406
00:27:00.175 --> 00:27:01.134
where they went.

407
00:27:01.259 --> 00:27:02.969
Is there anything else
you can show me?


408
00:28:21.298 --> 00:28:23.675
People came here
to enjoy glamour.


409
00:28:24.134 --> 00:28:25.135
They still do.

410
00:28:25.469 --> 00:28:27.387
We host brunch on Sundays.

411
00:28:27.387 --> 00:28:29.389
Wedding receptions.
Corporate parties.


412
00:28:29.598 --> 00:28:31.516
You know, Bar-mitzvahs
and what-not.


413
00:28:32.517 --> 00:28:33.810
Oh, throughout the voyage,

414
00:28:34.311 --> 00:28:38.065
er, those ships marked
The Queen's Mary's
location along the Atlantic.


415
00:28:38.315 --> 00:28:42.861
Unfortunately, they
stopped working
after we permanently
docked in '67.


416
00:28:42.861 --> 00:28:46.406
We could capture these
fascinating details
in a wholly original way.


417
00:28:47.157 --> 00:28:48.950
Well, other people have
taken pictures.


418
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.078
How do you propose
your book will be any different?


419
00:28:51.745 --> 00:28:54.122
The quality of the work
and the story you tell
with the pictures,


420
00:28:54.122 --> 00:28:55.916
that's all very important.
But...


421
00:28:56.249 --> 00:28:58.043
...have you ever thought about
virtual reality?


422
00:28:58.293 --> 00:29:00.420
Imagine taking a tour
of The Queen Mary.


423
00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:02.339
Not as it is now, but...

424
00:29:03.382 --> 00:29:08.387
as it was in, I don't know,

425
00:29:08.512 --> 00:29:10.180
What would that entail?

426
00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.766
On site time. Just the scanning.

427
00:29:13.058 --> 00:29:15.018
The coding we could
do from anywhere.


428
00:29:15.227 --> 00:29:20.607
But we would need to cover...
every inch of the ship.


429
00:29:24.778 --> 00:29:27.447
You're fucking kidding me?

430
00:29:28.281 --> 00:29:29.449
I'm sorry?

431
00:29:30.784 --> 00:29:32.452
Thank you, Miss Calder.

432
00:29:32.452 --> 00:29:35.497
I'll, er, pass this
along to Mr Torres
and we'll get back to you.


433
00:29:44.339 --> 00:29:46.717
Over here is the grand salon

434
00:29:46.717 --> 00:29:50.095
and, er, if you'll
all come this way,
we'll go to our...


435
00:29:58.603 --> 00:30:00.272
He seems traumatised.

436
00:30:00.647 --> 00:30:03.859
I just...sorry, I turned around,
he was just gone and I ...


437
00:30:05.485 --> 00:30:06.820
How'd the meeting go?

438
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.238
Fine.

439
00:30:08.238 --> 00:30:10.365
Um, I was thinking,
if this book thing goes well,


440
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.742
maybe we could try again.

441
00:30:11.867 --> 00:30:13.702
Settle down, buy a house.

442
00:30:13.702 --> 00:30:16.121
I'm the only one still
renting at my firm, so...


443
00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.834
Does now feel like
the right time
to be talking about this?


444
00:30:21.752 --> 00:30:22.919
All I wanna do is know

445
00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:25.297
that we're thinking
the same thing
for our son.


446
00:30:25.297 --> 00:30:28.008
'Cause Lukas needs stability,
we, we both need stability,
right?


447
00:30:28.008 --> 00:30:29.468
There is no 'we'.

448
00:30:29.468 --> 00:30:32.054
-And he's not your son.
-Come on.


449
00:30:32.054 --> 00:30:33.597
We, we, we raised him together.

450
00:30:33.597 --> 00:30:35.932
You can't just move
to another town
and shut me out.


451
00:30:35.932 --> 00:30:38.018
Stop it, it's way overdue
we all moved on.


452
00:30:38.018 --> 00:30:41.229
I, I hear what
you're saying,
but it's a house, not a prison.


453
00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:42.397
You always made it feel

454
00:30:42.397 --> 00:30:44.232
so God damn permanent.

455
00:30:44.858 --> 00:30:46.902
Jackie, darling.

456
00:30:47.361 --> 00:30:49.404
If I'm doing that I,
I'm not aware...


457
00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:51.365
You mustn't worry.

458
00:30:54.284 --> 00:30:55.911
-...move to another town and...
-We have to move forward.


459
00:30:56.036 --> 00:30:58.205
You're going
to a new home.


460
00:30:58.538 --> 00:31:00.123
This is your home.

461
00:31:00.248 --> 00:31:03.752
You die here,
you stay here forever.


462
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:07.839
Honey, are you okay?

463
00:31:07.964 --> 00:31:09.841
Wait for us there.

464
00:31:11.676 --> 00:31:15.347
And we'll be
a family again.


465
00:31:15.514 --> 00:31:17.474
We found him. No big deal.

466
00:31:17.474 --> 00:31:19.559
-He's wet.
-Yeah, I can see that.


467
00:31:19.768 --> 00:31:21.520
You know, but otherwise
unharmed.


468
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.230
Come on,
let's get you home and dry.


469
00:31:23.355 --> 00:31:24.648
You poor thing.

470
00:31:24.856 --> 00:31:27.818
Miss Calder!
Wait, wait! Miss Calder!


471
00:31:44.292 --> 00:31:46.294
Miss Calder?
Charles Bittner.


472
00:31:46.294 --> 00:31:47.337
Good news.

473
00:31:47.337 --> 00:31:49.423
We'd like you and your
family to come back


474
00:31:49.423 --> 00:31:51.341
and work on that exciting
project.


475
00:31:51.925 --> 00:31:54.720
Mr Torres thinks
is a great idea.


476
00:31:54.928 --> 00:31:57.848
Luckily, we've renovation
scheduled
this weekend,


477
00:31:57.848 --> 00:32:01.184
so, you'll have the, er,
the entire ship to yourself.


478
00:32:01.893 --> 00:32:05.313
♪Good times are finally back♪

479
00:32:05.814 --> 00:32:09.359
♪ Here to stay and
that's a fact ♪


480
00:32:09.776 --> 00:32:12.487
♪Living free again...♪

481
00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.700
♪Good times are finally back♪

482
00:32:26.126 --> 00:32:28.628
I'm on the lookout for
my next big star.


483
00:32:28.628 --> 00:32:31.256
She could be right here,
in this room,


484
00:32:31.256 --> 00:32:33.633
you just never know.

485
00:32:37.137 --> 00:32:39.181
You
just never know.


486
00:32:43.477 --> 00:32:45.020
Where are you going?

487
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.522
How's he supposed to notice me
if I'm planted to a chair?


488
00:32:47.647 --> 00:32:49.941
I told you, we don't beg, ever.

489
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:52.361
Well, I say let the
cards decide.


490
00:32:52.361 --> 00:32:53.904
No, we shouldn't draw attention.

491
00:32:54.696 --> 00:32:56.448
What if somebody else questions
and we've to explains things?


492
00:32:56.448 --> 00:32:57.532
-Things?
-Things.


493
00:32:57.532 --> 00:32:59.368
We were offered tickets
to America
and we took 'em.


494
00:32:59.368 --> 00:33:00.786
What's wrong with that?

495
00:33:01.161 --> 00:33:03.121
They paid me to read
their fortune.


496
00:33:03.538 --> 00:33:05.540
I told them they'd die
if they left London.


497
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.625
Who's to say they wouldn't?

498
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.127
That was wrong.
It's not what the cards said.


499
00:33:09.878 --> 00:33:11.671
We were fine in third class.

500
00:33:12.589 --> 00:33:15.133
We don't belong there
and neither does she.


501
00:33:22.265 --> 00:33:23.642
Hmm-mm.

502
00:33:23.642 --> 00:33:26.103
Now then, put that in your pipe.

503
00:33:55.632 --> 00:33:57.509
Have you seen George's new film?

504
00:33:57.801 --> 00:33:59.386
Oh, it's simply divine.

505
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.680
Hepburn lights up every room.

506
00:34:02.472 --> 00:34:04.016
Including the box office.

507
00:34:04.182 --> 00:34:06.643
I don't know how to compare it
to some of his earlier pictures,


508
00:34:06.935 --> 00:34:10.272
probably not as entertaining as
Two Dinosaurs Meet
While Ice Skating.


509
00:34:10.897 --> 00:34:12.149
But it is just magical,
wouldn't you agree?


510
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:13.692
Excuse me, Sir.

511
00:34:13.692 --> 00:34:15.068
Now, you may ask,
what is the distinction between


512
00:34:15.068 --> 00:34:16.444
subject matter and style.

513
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:18.196
-But this is a cinematic...
-I'm a dancer.


514
00:34:18.196 --> 00:34:20.323
-...experiment in style.
-I'd to audition for
your next movie.


515
00:34:21.575 --> 00:34:22.617
What now, my dear?

516
00:34:22.617 --> 00:34:23.702
I'm a dancer.

517
00:34:23.702 --> 00:34:25.787
I'd like to audition for
your next movie.


518
00:34:25.995 --> 00:34:27.873
I'm the star
you've been looking for.


519
00:34:32.294 --> 00:34:35.504
Did your parents not teach you
that it is very rude


520
00:34:35.504 --> 00:34:39.426
to come to a table uninvited?
-Oh, Viktor. Come now.


521
00:34:48.393 --> 00:34:50.270
Good evening, your name please.

522
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.730
Mr and Mrs Howe.

523
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.399
Frightfully sorry I had
to cancel earlier.


524
00:34:54.691 --> 00:34:56.902
My wife is feeling
much better now.


525
00:34:57.652 --> 00:34:59.279
Is there a table still free?

526
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.873
What happened?

527
00:35:12.876 --> 00:35:13.835
Oh.

528
00:35:20.759 --> 00:35:23.261
David.

529
00:35:23.261 --> 00:35:25.055
He once asked,
can I give him a scoop?


530
00:35:25.347 --> 00:35:27.766
A scoop, I said, of what
ice cream?!


531
00:35:27.974 --> 00:35:29.142
Well, I'm a sherbet...

532
00:35:29.142 --> 00:35:30.102
Excuse me.

533
00:35:30.977 --> 00:35:32.646
Sir, that's my girl
you just spoke to.


534
00:35:32.646 --> 00:35:35.107
She's, er, just a little upset.

535
00:35:42.447 --> 00:35:43.407
Now...

536
00:35:44.908 --> 00:35:46.868
I apologise that she
interrupted you,


537
00:35:46.868 --> 00:35:50.163
but she wants to be in movies
more than anything and, er...


538
00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:52.082
and now she's just
a little upset.


539
00:35:52.082 --> 00:35:54.042
She's talking about
abandoning her dream,


540
00:35:54.042 --> 00:35:55.669
which upset my wife.

541
00:35:55.669 --> 00:35:57.295
Oh, we're also performers.

542
00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:01.216
Now, she's a dancer.
A very good one.


543
00:36:01.508 --> 00:36:02.592
Better than that Ginger Rogers.

544
00:36:02.592 --> 00:36:04.553
-Oh, she is?
-Oh!


545
00:36:04.553 --> 00:36:07.639
You'll be doing
me a big favour
if you just reconsider.


546
00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:10.058
You, you see what see can do,
you won't be sorry.


547
00:36:22.529 --> 00:36:25.741
Please.

548
00:36:40.338 --> 00:36:41.465
Please.

549
00:36:42.883 --> 00:36:44.760
And who are you?

550
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:47.137
My thought exactly.

551
00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:54.644
Go home.
We'll reschedule.


552
00:36:54.644 --> 00:36:56.521
Why would you
invite us here
and then tell us to go home?


553
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:58.106
Isn't the book from
your son's perspective?


554
00:36:58.106 --> 00:36:59.358
Er, yeah, but...

555
00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:01.109
Well, so he
should be here.


556
00:37:01.276 --> 00:37:03.403
It's empty now.
It's the perfect time to do it.


557
00:37:03.528 --> 00:37:07.532
Oh, we refurbish
all the time.
Yeah, tourism is eating
this ship alive.


558
00:37:07.532 --> 00:37:09.117
People come, they take things.

559
00:37:09.368 --> 00:37:11.620
Souvenirs that cost
us a fortune.


560
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.456
You know the worst offender?

561
00:37:14.706 --> 00:37:17.042
I mean, you'll laugh.

562
00:37:17.209 --> 00:37:18.251
Mould.

563
00:37:18.251 --> 00:37:19.586
-What, mould?
-Hmm.


564
00:37:19.586 --> 00:37:21.880
Such a tiny nuisance, you know.

565
00:37:22.547 --> 00:37:24.966
We got leaking roofs,
dripping air ducts,


566
00:37:24.966 --> 00:37:28.553
sweating plumbing pipes
and all this...damp.


567
00:37:29.429 --> 00:37:31.598
I mean, you wouldn't think it
when you're up there
in the fresh air.


568
00:37:31.598 --> 00:37:33.350
But below deck
is the perfect breeding ground


569
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.520
for some really...
nasty organisms.


570
00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:41.233
Which might explain
why your son is sick.


571
00:37:41.233 --> 00:37:43.360
Tell me, did Lukas
mention the ship
when you got home?


572
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.612
He said he left his camera
in the pool area.


573
00:37:45.612 --> 00:37:47.572
-Pool?
-His clothes were wet.


574
00:37:47.572 --> 00:37:49.282
No, pockets of stagnant water.

575
00:37:49.282 --> 00:37:50.492
Poor ventilation.

576
00:37:50.784 --> 00:37:51.827
He said the pool.

577
00:37:51.827 --> 00:37:54.162
When we docked in '67,
the boilers came out,


578
00:37:54.162 --> 00:37:55.747
so did the pool above it.

579
00:37:55.747 --> 00:37:58.583
It was a tragedy, really.
She was a real pearl. But...


580
00:37:59.626 --> 00:38:03.338
Look, er, I know this
isn't the same
without Lukas.


581
00:38:03.797 --> 00:38:05.465
So how about when you come back,

582
00:38:05.465 --> 00:38:08.552
I'll give you a deluxe,
all access, tour.


583
00:38:08.844 --> 00:38:10.262
With me as your guide, yeah?

584
00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:13.015
And, er, this is you.

585
00:38:14.891 --> 00:38:18.478
I had to leave my
very sick son...
at home


586
00:38:19.354 --> 00:38:23.108
in order to come here
because he knows this is, um...


587
00:38:24.526 --> 00:38:26.153
a last chance for us.

588
00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.865
I even had to call my very
unpleasant mother


589
00:38:30.157 --> 00:38:31.533
to ask her to watch him.

590
00:38:32.034 --> 00:38:35.495
And as you can imagine,
I don't like calling
her for anything.


591
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.249
We are just not leaving here
empty handed...


592
00:38:40.625 --> 00:38:41.835
Captain.

593
00:38:43.879 --> 00:38:47.382
I am not asking you,
I am begging you.


594
00:38:48.383 --> 00:38:49.342
Okay.

595
00:38:50.886 --> 00:38:51.928
Okay!

596
00:38:53.138 --> 00:38:56.975
But, er, anything below M deck
is restricted.


597
00:38:57.976 --> 00:39:00.145
He's not exactly Captain
material,
is he?


598
00:39:08.153 --> 00:39:10.447
If you don't wanna do this,
I understand.


599
00:39:12.574 --> 00:39:15.202
I'm here, aren't I?

600
00:39:39.601 --> 00:39:41.812
Your mask, Sir. Remove it.

601
00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:44.022
My mask?
What does that have to
do with anything?


602
00:39:44.147 --> 00:39:45.691
There is a special place in hell

603
00:39:46.191 --> 00:39:48.318
for men who impersonate
war heroes.


604
00:39:53.949 --> 00:39:55.951
If you're not who
you claim to be,
then who are you?


605
00:40:01.581 --> 00:40:05.335
Should anything happen
to your father or I, stay here.


606
00:40:07.504 --> 00:40:08.547
Come with me, Sir.

607
00:40:08.547 --> 00:40:10.132
What on earth are you doing?

608
00:40:10.132 --> 00:40:11.883
Give me your hands. Come on.

609
00:40:13.385 --> 00:40:16.763
...just see what she can do.
Just see what she can do.


610
00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:21.101
♪Might be a curse♪

611
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:24.021
♪It makes your mind
all into a blur


612
00:40:24.146 --> 00:40:25.856
♪You won't be feeling...♪

613
00:40:28.191 --> 00:40:33.196
Your, er, film, One
Up, One Down.
Didn't think much of it.


614
00:40:34.072 --> 00:40:35.866
The plot wasn't very realistic.

615
00:40:36.158 --> 00:40:38.118
Oh, a critic.

616
00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:42.581
This, no doubt, is why
he hides his face.


617
00:40:48.754 --> 00:40:50.338
A parent would do anything
for their child.


618
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:53.425
Even if it requires looking
rather...foolish.


619
00:41:01.183 --> 00:41:03.602
Enjoy the rest
of your evening.


620
00:41:13.236 --> 00:41:15.947
I told you, I told you,
I told you he'd be there.


621
00:41:15.947 --> 00:41:17.282
-Darling.
-Yeah?


622
00:41:17.449 --> 00:41:18.700
-Your mask.
-Oh.


623
00:41:21.828 --> 00:41:23.080
D'you think she bought it?

624
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.623
-Yes.
-Hmm.


625
00:41:24.623 --> 00:41:25.957
You were magnificent.

626
00:41:26.208 --> 00:41:28.460
A little part of me feels bad

01:03:59.019 --> 01:04:00.145
Take it.

791
01:04:04.316 --> 01:04:07.194
Just tell me.

792
01:04:33.053 --> 01:04:36.723
My service to this ship has...
come to an end.


793
01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:40.352
Thank your family
for me, will you?


794
01:04:41.687 --> 01:04:44.231
Eight years without sport was...

795
01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.109
...tough.

796
01:05:07.254 --> 01:05:08.755
No, no, no, no, no!

797
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.845
Urgh!

So, find the exit.

807

In
a few moments,
the Ghost and Legends tour


823
01:08:25.243 --> 01:08:29.164
will disembark from
the grand staircase
on the promenade level.


824
01:08:29.539 --> 01:08:32.667
Join our resident guides
as they lead you into the depths


825
01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:37.005
of the RMS Queen Mary
in an effort to connect
with spirits


826
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:39.466
who still call the ship home.

827
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:44.596
Stops include the
isolation ward,
door number 13,


828
01:08:44.762 --> 01:08:46.222
the boiler room,

829
01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:50.185
and the infamous B-474
state room.


830
01:08:50.601 --> 01:08:54.189
That's Ghosts and Legends
departing soon.


831
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:04.408
Bittner.
Yeah?


832
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.534
Will you turn it down?

833
01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:17.878
It's Torres.

834
01:09:18.213 --> 01:09:20.382
Yeah?
You're closed for business?


835
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:21.758
Yeah.

836
01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.510
Management is concerned.

837
01:09:23.635 --> 01:09:25.220
Yeah, we're, er...

838
01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.889
we're renovating.

839
01:09:27.889 --> 01:09:29.975
Must be
a pretty big job?


840
01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:33.228
Well, it's an emergency.
It's just a couple of days.


841
01:09:35.021 --> 01:09:38.108
We've creditors crawling
up our ass
threatening to call in loans.


842
01:09:38.108 --> 01:09:40.193
I mean, do we look
like Disney Land?


843
01:09:41.903 --> 01:09:45.699
Look, I've been
doing this a long
time, Mr Torres,


844
01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:49.494
and I'm telling you,
it's better to cut
a problem off at the root.


845
01:09:50.162 --> 01:09:51.538
What problem?

846
01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:57.294
Bittner, are you there?

847
01:09:59.838 --> 01:10:01.048
Bittner!

848
01:10:01.256 --> 01:10:04.885
One of our guests
stole a vessel.


849
01:10:05.343 --> 01:10:06.553
A lifeboat?

850
01:10:07.012 --> 01:10:08.388
Er, no.

851
01:10:09.681 --> 01:10:10.640
Oh?

852
01:10:11.516 --> 01:10:14.394
A little girl, er,
took one home.


853
01:10:15.103 --> 01:10:18.231
I called the parents,
requested they return it,


854
01:10:18.648 --> 01:10:20.567
but they fed me some bullshit.

855
01:10:21.276 --> 01:10:22.778
Said she wasn't coming back,

856
01:10:22.778 --> 01:10:26.073
so I need time to find out
what they know and fix it.


857
01:10:26.198 --> 01:10:29.409
Soon as I'm done,
doors will open.


858
01:10:30.243 --> 01:10:31.703
Get rid of them.

859
01:10:32.454 --> 01:10:34.748
I don't think you understand.

860
01:10:34.748 --> 01:10:36.666
No, no. We agreed.

861
01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:41.588
You sell The Queen
Mary experience,
tours, merchandise,
churro and whatnot,


862
01:10:41.713 --> 01:10:43.924
and we ignore whatever
goes on there.


863
01:10:43.924 --> 01:10:46.176
But if you go and make
an even bigger mess,


864
01:10:46.176 --> 01:10:47.636
that's a problem.

865
01:10:47.636 --> 01:10:49.805
Call me tomorrow
when doors are open.


866
01:10:49.805 --> 01:10:51.348
-And Bittner?
-Yeah?


867
01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:53.725
You're a security guard.
Don't fucking...


868
01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:11.618
Hey, Jesus!

869
01:11:11.618 --> 01:11:13.537
I'll make you a Manhattan later
if you want.


870
01:11:13.829 --> 01:11:15.706
I think it was the
girl's mother.


871
01:11:15.997 --> 01:11:17.666
-Ow!
-Yeah, I believe you.


872
01:11:19.918 --> 01:11:22.421
That wasn't your son
you left with...


873
01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.881
Our son.

874
01:11:32.931 --> 01:11:38.145
I know you only stayed
for Lukas,
all these years.


875
01:11:38.145 --> 01:11:39.187
I know that.

876
01:11:39.187 --> 01:11:40.522
Wait, wait, please.

877
01:11:41.815 --> 01:11:42.816
But, um...

878
01:11:46.111 --> 01:11:47.487
what happens if he is here?

879
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.118
Then I'll stay.

880
01:11:57.205 --> 01:11:58.290
Okay.

881
01:12:00.876 --> 01:12:04.379
It's just that I don't know
where to find the pool.


882
01:12:07.174 --> 01:12:08.133
I do.

883
01:12:10.177 --> 01:12:11.553
I think we're done here.

884
01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.779
Anne, Captain Bittner here.

885
01:12:28.779 --> 01:12:30.822
Oh, hello.

886
01:12:31.198 --> 01:12:33.200
I'm sorry, the power is down.

887
01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.410
This whole place is a death trap
when it rains.


888
01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:36.453
Look, I called maintenance,

889
01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:38.330
but they said they won't be here
until tomorrow.


890
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:39.664
I mean, "Tomorrow?" I said.

891
01:12:39.664 --> 01:12:41.750
"We've guests working on
a special project."


892
01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:45.796
They apologised and all,
but tomorrow's the
best they can do.


893
01:12:45.796 --> 01:12:46.880
We brought torches.

894
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.006
Yeah, if it was up to me,

895
01:12:48.006 --> 01:12:49.633
I wouldn't care
if you looked around,


896
01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:51.385
but it's an insurance
risk, you know.


897
01:12:51.385 --> 01:12:53.637
Those guys, they're
a pain in the ass,
you understand?


898
01:12:53.637 --> 01:12:55.013
We'll be careful.

899
01:12:55.013 --> 01:12:56.723
Yeah, no doubt.
Still, we shouldn't
take any risks.


900
01:12:56.723 --> 01:12:58.308
Let's reschedule, I insist.

901
01:12:58.433 --> 01:13:00.686
Pour yourself a drink,
I'll come get you.


902
01:13:01.061 --> 01:13:03.063
We'll walk to your cabin,
collect your stuff.


903
01:13:03.522 --> 01:13:06.525
And, er, I can tell
you about the time
Walt Disney and I smoked cigars


904
01:13:06.525 --> 01:13:09.111
in the bar until the
wee hours. Huh?


905
01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:12.364
Okay, Captain.

906
01:13:12.906 --> 01:13:14.783
We gotta go.

907
01:13:14.783 --> 01:13:15.909
You know what?

908
01:13:16.576 --> 01:13:18.036
Think I will have that drink.

909
01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:25.752
Hell are you going?

910
01:13:38.015 --> 01:13:40.392
Go! Clear!

911
01:13:40.392 --> 01:13:41.852
- My face!
- Move!


912
01:13:41.852 --> 01:13:43.228
- My face!
- Wait!


913
01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:44.938
Make way
for the Captain!


914
01:13:46.273 --> 01:13:48.025
Give it here.

915
01:13:50.902 --> 01:13:53.321
Not...my...swally!

916
01:13:53.321 --> 01:13:54.656
Easy, easy!

917
01:13:57.451 --> 01:13:59.619
Go. Go!

918
01:14:12.257 --> 01:14:13.884
Oh God, oh God.

919
01:14:29.483 --> 01:14:30.567
Captain.

920
01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:32.027
Gibson! Bloody hell.

921
01:14:36.323 --> 01:14:39.117
Forward generator burned out.
All the flood doors are closing.


922
01:14:39.534 --> 01:14:40.994
Shall we contact New York?

923
01:14:40.994 --> 01:14:42.579
The navy? I mean,
maybe they have a craft
in the area.


924
01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:44.331
No, no. Just,
just......


925
01:14:44.331 --> 01:14:47.000
just tell them
it's part of tonight's
entertainment.


926
01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:48.502
Sir?

927
01:14:48.752 --> 01:14:50.212
-Why aren't you upstairs?
-Well, I was.


928
01:14:50.212 --> 01:14:52.172
But an incident occurred
with one of the passengers.


929
01:14:52.172 --> 01:14:54.800
-Well, take care of it.
-There's been a murder.


930
01:15:08.188 --> 01:15:09.356
David Ratch.

931
01:15:09.356 --> 01:15:11.733
Travelling third class
with his family.


932
01:15:11.733 --> 01:15:15.070
Appears Mr Ratch lost his senses
some time after dinner.


933
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:17.614
Found him covered in
his wife's blood
trying to launch a life vessel.


934
01:15:17.823 --> 01:15:19.574
Took three men to restrain him.

935
01:15:19.574 --> 01:15:20.951
He's in the infirmary now.

936
01:15:21.493 --> 01:15:22.953
Bloody hell,
how did they get down here?


937
01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:24.663
Captain!
Why's she so slow this
evening, huh?!


938
01:15:24.663 --> 01:15:26.289
Party's upstairs, gentlemen.

939
01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:28.041
- Are we sinking?!
- Alright, alright. That'll do.


940
01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.961
The fastest ship, my
arse.


941
01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:33.463
Where is Mrs Ratch?

942
01:15:33.463 --> 01:15:35.132
Cabin B-474.

943
01:15:35.132 --> 01:15:37.259
Apparently, he did
it with an axe.
Made a frightful mess.


944
01:15:37.384 --> 01:15:39.720
They have a young daughter.
Our people are trying
to locate her.


945
01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.139
She was last seen leaving
the grand salon by herself,


946
01:15:42.139 --> 01:15:43.598
approximately eight thirty.

947
01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:51.606
How dare you make a joke
about my wife?!


948
01:15:51.606 --> 01:15:52.649
I wasn't...

949
01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:56.611
Sir, respectfully,
why are we here


950
01:15:56.611 --> 01:15:58.071
and not at the scene
or on the bridge?


951
01:15:58.363 --> 01:15:59.906
I needed to see for myself.

952
01:16:00.574 --> 01:16:02.534
Clock stopped at seven.

953
01:16:02.909 --> 01:16:05.245
Same time you reported
the accident downstairs.


954
01:16:06.079 --> 01:16:07.372
The prisoner say anything?

955
01:16:07.706 --> 01:16:08.665
Well, like what?

956
01:16:08.957 --> 01:16:10.792
Other than the obvious crazy?

957
01:16:11.293 --> 01:16:13.503
Was there anything
that stood out?


958
01:16:13.795 --> 01:16:15.630
Well apparently, his
friends call him
Clarky.


959
01:16:15.964 --> 01:16:18.133
Thought it was a bit odd
for someone with the
surname Ratch.


960
01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:21.678
He then used some rather
choice words
to indicate how the
officer could


961
01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:24.014
use a 'so-and-so' and insert it.

962
01:16:24.598 --> 01:16:26.141
- A cigarette?
- No.


963
01:16:27.225 --> 01:16:29.061
-Have you a cigarette, Gibson?
-Oh.


964
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:34.441
It must be time to send an SOS.

965
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:38.862
Have you witnessed
a ship go down?


966
01:16:40.781 --> 01:16:41.740
No.

967
01:16:42.908 --> 01:16:43.867
I have.

968
01:16:45.369 --> 01:16:47.162
My father did everything
he could.


969
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.665
Gave the order within
plenty of time.


970
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:54.086
People get scared.

971
01:16:55.545 --> 01:16:58.632
They panic...and
fight like rats.


972
01:16:59.841 --> 01:17:01.885
I won't let that happen
on this ship.


973
01:17:02.552 --> 01:17:04.262
Not while we can still save her.

974
01:17:04.888 --> 01:17:06.348
Well, shall I report
to the bridge and...


975
01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:08.975
coordinate our resources
from there?


976
01:17:11.937 --> 01:17:13.146
You don't understand.

977
01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:16.566
Our only concern now

978
01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.152
is Mr Ratch.

979
01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:53.562
Frightfully sorry to bother you.

980
01:17:54.688 --> 01:17:57.107
But I'm supposed to
meet my husband in New York.


981
01:17:57.357 --> 01:17:59.860
And the captain said
I can't disembark.


982
01:18:01.236 --> 01:18:05.157
If you see my husband,
can you send him a message?


983
01:18:06.033 --> 01:18:08.201
I need...

984
01:18:08.201 --> 01:18:09.536
Oh!

985
01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:14.499
...to leave...

986
01:18:16.126 --> 01:18:17.753
...this...

987
01:18:17.878 --> 01:18:20.297
...ship...

988
01:18:21.256 --> 01:18:23.884
I need to leave this ship,
I need to leave this ship!


989
01:18:23.884 --> 01:18:28.305
I need to
leave this ship!
I need to leave this ship!


990
01:18:28.513 --> 01:18:34.061
I need to leave this ship!
I need to leave this ship!


991
01:18:34.227 --> 01:18:37.522
I need to leave this...!

992
01:19:09.262 --> 01:19:11.556
The pool.
It's below M deck.


993
01:19:13.183 --> 01:19:15.769
Bittner, you sneaky
little prick.


994
01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.110
Shit.

995
01:19:23.694 --> 01:19:26.238
It's all wet. Even the scanner.

996
01:19:26.405 --> 01:19:28.323
This'll need time to dry.

997
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:41.503
Friend of Bittner's, you think?

998
01:19:50.887 --> 01:19:53.390
You know, I thought
if we did this project together,


999
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.309
you and Lukas would come home
and we'd be...


1000
01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:59.438
a...a kind of family again.

1001
01:20:00.313 --> 01:20:02.357
But honestly, the last
thing I expected


1002
01:20:03.233 --> 01:20:06.278
was to get your answer
before we even started.


1003
01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:08.405
So, I, I guess...

1004
01:20:10.198 --> 01:20:11.950
how come I wasn't enough?

1005
01:20:13.076 --> 01:20:14.036
Oh no.

1006
01:20:14.745 --> 01:20:16.329
No, no, that's not what it is.

1007
01:20:16.705 --> 01:20:18.331
I just don't believe
in marriage.


1008
01:20:18.999 --> 01:20:20.208
I failed once.

1009
01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.672
I still want to escape.

1010
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:30.052
It's just that the urge
to be with Lukas is stronger.


1011
01:20:36.892 --> 01:20:38.518
You know, if you stay here,

1012
01:20:40.103 --> 01:20:42.773
you'll get trapped
like that shrieking woman.


1013
01:20:45.734 --> 01:20:49.821
You'll end up as a footnote
in one of Bittner's
haunted tours.


1014
01:20:49.821 --> 01:20:52.407
A historical curiosity,
nothing more.


1015
01:20:57.537 --> 01:20:58.497
Patrick.

1016
01:20:59.289 --> 01:21:00.248
Yeah?

1017
01:21:00.916 --> 01:21:03.210
I can't leave my son alone here.

1018
01:21:08.799 --> 01:21:09.925
Fine.

1019
01:21:10.384 --> 01:21:13.178
We can be the dead family
still walking the deck.


1020
01:22:07.816 --> 01:22:09.609
Ugh, that smell.

1021
01:23:49.209 --> 01:23:51.294
Motherfuckers!

1022
01:24:30.959 --> 01:24:32.085
Look.

1023
01:24:33.712 --> 01:24:35.630
He's still here, Patrick.

1024
01:25:01.948 --> 01:25:07.412
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1025
01:25:41.029 --> 01:25:42.447
Oh, Christ.

1026
01:25:47.953 --> 01:25:49.746
Send the distress code.

1027
01:25:49.746 --> 01:25:52.624
It won't
make a difference,
don't you see?


1028
01:25:52.624 --> 01:25:56.461
The man roaming freely
is why the ship is faltering.


1029
01:26:06.888 --> 01:26:08.015
Hello?

1030
01:26:09.725 --> 01:26:11.143
Miss Calder?

1031
01:26:20.110 --> 01:26:21.820
Are you alright in there?

1032
01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:51.475
Oh, fuck!

1033
01:26:58.482 --> 01:27:00.901
Wow, he used
the whole roll.


1034
01:27:01.276 --> 01:27:02.402
Be careful.

1035
01:27:12.913 --> 01:27:14.915
I need to know
what Bittner's hiding.


1036
01:27:21.046 --> 01:27:22.506
Is that it?

1037
01:27:23.715 --> 01:27:24.883
Damn.

1038
01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.010
I've never seen a doorway to...

1039
01:27:28.136 --> 01:27:29.221
...fuck knows.

1040
01:27:33.975 --> 01:27:35.018
Anything?

1041
01:27:39.481 --> 01:27:42.567
Is that a...child?

1042
01:27:44.653 --> 01:27:45.737
No.

1043
01:27:47.364 --> 01:27:49.700
No, judging by the size,
I'd say an adult.


1044
01:27:50.826 --> 01:27:52.160
And it's in the structure,

1045
01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.954
so probably from the time
the ship was built.


1046
01:27:54.371 --> 01:27:56.665
Also, there's no way
they could put the metal
poles in there


1047
01:27:56.665 --> 01:27:58.542
after pouring the concrete.
Which...


1048
01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:01.545
...which tells me the workers
knew about it.


1049
01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.382
Or they did it.

1050
01:28:05.507 --> 01:28:11.138
After Wall
Street tumbled in
'29, Clydebank shipyard
closed its doors.


1051
01:28:12.389 --> 01:28:15.600
While this vessel was
just bare bones.


1052
01:28:17.936 --> 01:28:21.314
The ship spent three long years
overlooking that town.


1053
01:28:21.314 --> 01:28:22.357
Like a coffin.

1054
01:28:23.025 --> 01:28:24.568
As if they needed reminding

1055
01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.113
what would happen if her future
couldn't be secured.


1056
01:28:29.823 --> 01:28:31.908
Then with the nation's
pride at stake,


1057
01:28:32.784 --> 01:28:35.495
the British Government
stepped in
with a financial commitment,


1058
01:28:35.495 --> 01:28:36.788
to guarantee completion.

1059
01:28:38.373 --> 01:28:41.126
With Clydebank's
future at stake,


1060
01:28:42.127 --> 01:28:43.545
the workers stepped in.

1061
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:46.339
To guarantee her success.

1062
01:28:47.799 --> 01:28:49.760
And that of future generations.

1063
01:28:52.345 --> 01:28:54.598
Crime locks many doors.

1064
01:28:57.976 --> 01:28:59.353
But for one prisoner,

1065
01:29:00.771 --> 01:29:02.230
it required...

1066
01:29:04.107 --> 01:29:05.359
sacrifice.

1067
01:29:05.359 --> 01:29:07.736
Foundation sacrifice,
to be exact.


1068
01:29:09.029 --> 01:29:11.406
According to an old engineering
tradition,


1069
01:29:11.573 --> 01:29:13.241
to guarantee structural
integrity,


1070
01:29:13.241 --> 01:29:15.786
one ought to bury a human
inside of the walls.


1071
01:29:16.036 --> 01:29:18.080
And the more pain he suffers,

1072
01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:21.875
the greater the bind...

1073
01:29:23.335 --> 01:29:24.920
...between his spirit...

1074
01:29:25.796 --> 01:29:27.005
and the ship.

1075
01:29:27.714 --> 01:29:30.300
Until both are inseparable.

1076
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:39.309
The workers selected
their victim,
Edward Clark.


1077
01:29:39.309 --> 01:29:41.770
Or Clarky as he was
known to them.


1078
01:29:42.354 --> 01:29:46.900
A riveter and former inmate,
rumoured to have murdered.


1079
01:29:47.818 --> 01:29:51.613
They inflicted on him
the most miserable of ends.


1080
01:29:53.782 --> 01:29:55.784
His sacrifice protected them.

1081
01:30:05.043 --> 01:30:07.921
Gave them the success
and peace of mind


1082
01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.965
they so badly craved.

1083
01:30:14.219 --> 01:30:15.679
That's a real thing?

1084
01:30:15.887 --> 01:30:17.431
What, foundation sacrifice?

1085
01:30:17.431 --> 01:30:19.516
Yeah.

1086
01:30:19.516 --> 01:30:21.768
Well, it's not exactly
on the curriculum at university,


1087
01:30:21.768 --> 01:30:23.228
but yeah, sure.

1088
01:30:23.812 --> 01:30:25.856
From time-to-time cases
have occurred.


1089
01:30:26.148 --> 01:30:27.607
I mean, it's an open secret.

1090
01:30:27.774 --> 01:30:30.152
Even kids' rhymes are about it.

1091
01:30:30.318 --> 01:30:32.446
London Bridge keeps
falling down until...


1092
01:30:32.446 --> 01:30:34.990
Until they lock
a man inside.


1093
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:37.743
Yeah.
Folklore based on
a grain of truth.


1094
01:30:38.785 --> 01:30:40.454
My God, that is barbaric.

1095
01:30:40.912 --> 01:30:43.165
And you actually believe
we're unsinkable?!


1096
01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:48.295
Might explain
how the ship
survived a World War


1097
01:30:49.087 --> 01:30:51.506
a dozen botched face lifts,

1098
01:30:52.132 --> 01:30:53.300
a rogue wave.

1099
01:30:55.510 --> 01:31:00.974
rTo reinstate the ship's power,
we must reinstate Mr Clark,


1100
01:31:01.683 --> 01:31:05.062
and kill whatever
flesh he is in.


1101
01:31:18.492 --> 01:31:19.785
Should we fail...

1102
01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:24.206
...your question as to whether
this ship is unsinkable...


1103
01:31:27.084 --> 01:31:29.461
...will most certainly
be answered.


1104
01:31:35.384 --> 01:31:36.343
Oh, my God!

1105
01:31:37.511 --> 01:31:39.763
Oh, my fucking God.

1106
01:31:42.057 --> 01:31:44.226
Shit!

1107
01:31:47.646 --> 01:31:48.772
Lukas?!

1108
01:31:48.772 --> 01:31:49.815
Patrick!

1109
01:31:49.815 --> 01:31:50.899
I see him.

1110
01:31:50.899 --> 01:31:52.651
-Baby, come back!
-Wait!


1111
01:32:08.625 --> 01:32:09.710
Anne!

1112
01:32:19.469 --> 01:32:22.139
Anne? Are you there?

1113
01:32:32.315 --> 01:32:35.652
Patrick, come in! Patrick.

1114
01:32:35.652 --> 01:32:36.611
Yeah, I'm here.

1115
01:32:39.448 --> 01:32:42.034
I followed Lukas to an elevator,
but he's gone.


1116
01:32:42.534 --> 01:32:43.577
Where are you?

1117
01:32:45.787 --> 01:32:49.124
I don't know, er,
cabin numbers are E-100s.


1118
01:32:49.291 --> 01:32:50.542
Okay, stay where you are...

1119
01:34:03.323 --> 01:34:05.117
Clear the
way, coming through!


1120
01:34:05.867 --> 01:34:07.077
Keep moving, upstairs.

1121
01:34:07.077 --> 01:34:08.453
And follow the safety orders.

1122
01:34:13.875 --> 01:34:15.043
Where is it?

1123
01:34:38.066 --> 01:34:39.234
Come on!

1124
01:34:45.365 --> 01:34:46.450
Keep moving!

1125
01:34:46.575 --> 01:34:48.243
Out of the way! 
Coming through!

1126
01:35:17.647 --> 01:35:20.067
You're not from
here, are you?


1127
01:35:23.695 --> 01:35:26.740
I'm sorry, excuse
my impertinence.


1128
01:35:28.075 --> 01:35:29.534
- Mum?
- Stay with us, please.


1129
01:35:29.659 --> 01:35:30.702
Lukas?

1130
01:35:30.702 --> 01:35:32.079
If you wish to stay,

1131
01:35:32.287 --> 01:35:34.289
y- y- you could take my place!

1132
01:35:34.289 --> 01:35:36.583
I really don't mind!

1133
01:35:37.084 --> 01:35:40.003
It's wonderful,
wonderful fun!


1134
01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:41.838
And I could leave...

1135
01:35:42.798 --> 01:35:44.841
just for
a little while.


1136
01:35:44.841 --> 01:35:46.510
You don't understand!

1137
01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:47.928
I've been here for so long!

1138
01:35:47.928 --> 01:35:49.554
I promise,
I'll come back.


1139
01:35:49.554 --> 01:35:51.056
None of this is real.

1140
01:35:51.848 --> 01:35:54.059
- None of this is real.
- Need your body!


1141
01:35:54.059 --> 01:35:55.602
But I need you more!

1142
01:35:56.019 --> 01:35:57.771
Why should you go and not me?!

1143
01:35:57.771 --> 01:35:59.898
Fuck me.
People are waiting for me!


1144
01:36:00.148 --> 01:36:02.359
Please! I'm begging you!

1145
01:36:02.359 --> 01:36:03.527
Lukas!

1146
01:36:03.527 --> 01:36:04.653
Where are you?!

1147
01:36:06.822 --> 01:36:08.448
Give me your body!

1148
01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.494
I must get off
of this boat!


1149
01:36:14.871 --> 01:36:16.164
Stop!

1150
01:36:17.082 --> 01:36:18.583
Where are you?

1151
01:36:23.088 --> 01:36:25.173
I thought you'd gone home.

1152
01:36:28.635 --> 01:36:29.720
Er...

1153
01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:32.139
yeah, we got lost
on the way out.


1154
01:36:36.810 --> 01:36:38.437
Have you seen Anne anywhere?

1155
01:36:39.146 --> 01:36:40.272
No.

1156
01:36:45.193 --> 01:36:46.236
Who's that?

1157
01:36:46.528 --> 01:36:47.863
That's nobody.

1158
01:36:51.074 --> 01:36:52.034
You sure?

1159
01:36:52.659 --> 01:36:53.618
Yeah.

1160
01:36:56.955 --> 01:36:58.415
So, so that...

1161
01:36:58.832 --> 01:37:00.542
that's not her on the trolley?

1162
01:37:01.376 --> 01:37:02.461
Oh, him?

1163
01:37:03.587 --> 01:37:05.380
No, it's just, er...

1164
01:37:07.299 --> 01:37:11.970
just some vagrant I caught,
er, sneaking around.


1165
01:37:16.725 --> 01:37:17.934
Okay.

1166
01:37:18.977 --> 01:37:20.604
Okay.

1167
01:37:20.604 --> 01:37:23.231
Er, we, we found the
swimming pool,
by the way.


1168
01:37:23.231 --> 01:37:25.734
You're right, she's,
she's a, she's a pearl.


1169
01:37:26.401 --> 01:37:29.738
And the, er, little brat
who absconded in your
son's place?


1170
01:37:29.738 --> 01:37:31.198
She told us everything.

1171
01:37:33.825 --> 01:37:35.994
Now, I was hoping you'd, er,
return with her,


1172
01:37:35.994 --> 01:37:39.456
so I could give you back
your son.


1173
01:37:42.584 --> 01:37:44.002
We left instructions.

1174
01:37:44.044 --> 01:37:46.088
If we don't walk out
of here tomorrow,
call the cops.


1175
01:37:46.171 --> 01:37:48.423
Tell them everything. Okay?

1176
01:37:48.673 --> 01:37:53.887
So even if that was true,
who'd believe her stories?


1177
01:37:54.012 --> 01:37:58.809
Well, actually,
a lot of people would.


1178
01:37:59.935 --> 01:38:02.729
Whatever secrets you've kept
hidden down here,


1179
01:38:02.729 --> 01:38:03.939
Lukas saw.

1180
01:38:04.314 --> 01:38:05.607
Okay, he saw them.

1181
01:38:07.943 --> 01:38:09.069
Give that to me.

1182
01:38:09.194 --> 01:38:10.570
No. No, no, no.

1183
01:38:10.862 --> 01:38:14.032
Not until we're safely
off the ship.


1184
01:38:25.419 --> 01:38:28.046
Move, move, move!
Where's that boy?


1185
01:38:31.842 --> 01:38:33.176
Clarky!

1186
01:38:42.477 --> 01:38:45.439
As we approach
the next stop of our tour,


1187
01:38:45.564 --> 01:38:47.899
we are reminded in these
hallowed halls


1188
01:38:47.899 --> 01:38:51.236
of how insignificant
we really are.


1189
01:38:51.236 --> 01:38:53.989
When even a ship as hardy
as the Queen Mary


1190
01:38:53.989 --> 01:38:55.949
could be brought to her knees.

1191
01:38:56.366 --> 01:39:00.328
The year 1942,
she was en route to Scotland


1192
01:39:00.328 --> 01:39:03.790
with ten thousand, three hundred
and ninety-eight soldiers,


1193
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:06.710
and nine hundred and fifty
crew on board.


1194
01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.048
Duly recorded on the ship's log
is the date and time,


1195
01:39:11.298 --> 01:39:14.593
the course, the destination,
weather conditions,


1196
01:39:15.093 --> 01:39:16.511
temperature,

1197
01:39:16.511 --> 01:39:18.722
longitude and latitude.

1198
01:39:18.930 --> 01:39:23.310
But what is never recorded
is the fear that washes
over a deck


1199
01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.604
like fog and ocean spray,

1200
01:39:25.604 --> 01:39:28.648
as a ninety foot rogue
wave appears.


1201
01:39:28.774 --> 01:39:32.527
Yes, the RMS Queen Mary
is a frightened ship,


1202
01:39:32.527 --> 01:39:36.990
and she carries with her
a premonition...of death.


1203
01:40:29.835 --> 01:40:32.754
Lukas. Oh, Lukas, baby.

1204
01:40:34.005 --> 01:40:35.090
Is that you?

1205
01:40:37.134 --> 01:40:38.176
Is that you?

1206
01:40:42.305 --> 01:40:45.517
What happened to Jackie,
Mommy?


1207
01:41:00.866 --> 01:41:01.867
Where are you?

1208
01:41:02.117 --> 01:41:03.326
Anne, please come in.

1209
01:41:03.326 --> 01:41:04.661
Fuck.

1210
01:41:10.792 --> 01:41:12.002
Oh.

1211
01:41:19.426 --> 01:41:20.427
Lukas?

1212
01:41:22.179 --> 01:41:23.221
Where are you?

1213
01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.245
Keep moving and stay calm.

1214
01:41:47.579 --> 01:41:49.456
It's all part of the show!

1215
01:41:51.958 --> 01:41:52.918
Move!

1216
01:41:54.586 --> 01:41:56.338
Move, move, move!

1217
01:42:02.677 --> 01:42:04.096
Don't let
him off the ship!


1218
01:42:08.183 --> 01:42:09.393
Reverse the winch.

1219
01:42:12.062 --> 01:42:15.190
No, lower it! Lower it!

1220
01:42:27.744 --> 01:42:30.872
Mom, why can't I move on?

1221
01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.500
Oh, Lukas baby.

1222
01:42:34.167 --> 01:42:36.253
Jackie told me what happened.

1223
01:42:37.129 --> 01:42:39.506
We left him in the pool.

1224
01:42:41.007 --> 01:42:42.634
- To rot...
- with the others.


1225
01:42:45.762 --> 01:42:47.097
Dad used to say...

1226
01:42:49.474 --> 01:42:52.769
...opportunity is
slippery


1227
01:42:53.812 --> 01:42:55.397
Like...

1228
01:42:56.565 --> 01:42:58.358
Like trying to catch a fish...

1229
01:42:59.484 --> 01:43:00.902
with your bare hands.

1230
01:43:02.112 --> 01:43:06.158
No matter
how much it begs,


1231
01:43:08.785 --> 01:43:10.287
tries to slip away,

1232
01:43:12.956 --> 01:43:14.583
hold on tight.

1233
01:43:21.006 --> 01:43:23.258
And don't be afraid

1234
01:43:24.551 --> 01:43:27.220
to get your hands dirty.

1235
01:43:27.596 --> 01:43:32.309
Where...is...she?

1236
01:43:35.228 --> 01:43:37.814
She's waiting for her mom.

1237
01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:44.821
Stay with me...forever.

1238
01:43:45.822 --> 01:43:47.616
We'll be a family again.

1239
01:43:49.117 --> 01:43:51.995
Yes, I'll stay.

1240
01:44:03.423 --> 01:44:05.759
It's useless trying
to leave, Clarky.


1241
01:44:05.759 --> 01:44:08.261
Even if I have to swim,
I'm getting off this ship.


1242
01:44:18.647 --> 01:44:24.027
Outside, there are laws
and obstacles to freedom.


1243
01:44:24.403 --> 01:44:26.071
Inside, there's only her.

1244
01:44:33.161 --> 01:44:34.663
I served my time.

1245
01:44:37.457 --> 01:44:39.126
I served my time!

1246
01:44:41.628 --> 01:44:43.004
I served my time!

1247
01:44:43.338 --> 01:44:45.382
You're the guardian, Clarky.

1248
01:44:45.924 --> 01:44:48.677
It's what they call
'a job for life'!


1249
01:44:50.345 --> 01:44:52.806
-Gibson!
-Captain, the man is unarmed!


1250
01:44:53.056 --> 01:44:54.224
Let go, you fool.

1251
01:44:54.224 --> 01:44:56.518
Or he'll take us all
to a watery grave.


1252
01:45:00.188 --> 01:45:01.898
Captain! Lower your rifle,

1253
01:45:01.898 --> 01:45:04.568
or I will have you
forcibly removed
and relieved of your duties.


1254
01:45:04.735 --> 01:45:06.778
If you are unwilling
to perform your duty,


1255
01:45:07.029 --> 01:45:08.447
I won't hesitate.

1256
01:45:20.375 --> 01:45:23.086
Get back in your box!

1257
01:46:04.586 --> 01:46:05.712
Play something.

1258
01:46:09.341 --> 01:46:10.675
Something nice.

Oh, fuck!

1276
01:51:16.064 --> 01:51:17.774
Oh, Captain Bittner.

1277
01:51:26.742 --> 01:51:28.201
Perhaps you can tell us.

1278
01:51:29.661 --> 01:51:30.620
Yeah?

1279
01:51:31.079 --> 01:51:32.080
Your secret?

1280
01:51:34.166 --> 01:51:36.376
I'm afraid I, er, I
don't know what...


1281
01:51:36.752 --> 01:51:39.004
I, I don't know what
you mean, I...


1282
01:51:40.881 --> 01:51:43.341
As the ship's longest
serving employee,


1283
01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:45.719
how she survived for so long?

1284
01:51:52.976 --> 01:51:55.395
Well, er,

1285
01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:00.233
young lady, I can, er,
I can recommend just the book.


1286
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:02.986
Available from our gift shop!

1287
01:52:04.279 --> 01:52:06.281
Okay, who wants a picture?
Come on, bring it in.


1288
01:52:06.406 --> 01:52:07.366
There you go.

1289
01:52:07.616 --> 01:52:10.827
This your first time
with a captain?


1290
01:52:12.788 --> 01:52:14.623
Ah.

1291
01:52:22.047 --> 01:52:23.215
Where is she?

1292
01:52:23.423 --> 01:52:24.466
She?

1293
01:52:24.591 --> 01:52:26.718
He. My son.

1294
01:52:28.678 --> 01:52:31.014
We would like to
speak with you about
the statement


1295
01:52:31.014 --> 01:52:33.642
you provided detectives
three days ago.


1296
01:52:37.396 --> 01:52:40.023
After Lukas climbed out
his bedroom window,


1297
01:52:40.273 --> 01:52:42.693
you said he accidentally
slipped.


1298
01:52:44.486 --> 01:52:45.487
And fell.

1299
01:52:46.196 --> 01:52:49.282
Well, a neighbour
has come forward
with an account


1300
01:52:49.491 --> 01:52:51.910
which...contradicts yours.

1301
01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:55.288
Help me! Please!

1302
01:52:56.206 --> 01:52:58.125
I'm sorry about your boy.

1303
01:53:01.378 --> 01:53:02.796
I had to escape.

1304
01:53:08.218 --> 01:53:09.177
No.

1305
01:53:11.221 --> 01:53:12.180
No, no.

1306
01:53:13.974 --> 01:53:14.933
No...er...

1307
01:53:16.893 --> 01:53:20.063
We, er...we escaped.

1308
01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:24.401
Miss Calder.

1309
01:53:24.401 --> 01:53:25.861
Sir, we, we escaped.

1310
01:53:25.986 --> 01:53:27.320
Miss Calder,

1311
01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.197
you're being charged with
second degree murder.


1312
01:53:37.539 --> 01:53:39.332
You have the right
to remain silent.


1313
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:41.460
Anything you say can

1314
01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:44.171
and will be used against you
in a court of law.


1315
01:53:45.213 --> 01:53:46.923
You have the right
to an attorney...


1316
01:53:54.931 --> 01:53:55.891
Hmm.

1317
01:53:59.686 --> 01:54:00.979
Hmm.

1318
01:54:01.688 --> 01:54:02.981
Hmm.

1319
01:54:07.069 --> 01:54:08.487
Miss Calder?

1320
01:54:11.907 --> 01:54:13.658
Miss Calder?

1321
01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.504
Captain Bittner for Torres.

1322
01:54:25.712 --> 01:54:26.671
Please hold.

1323
01:54:45.232 --> 01:54:46.983
Mr Torres on line two.

1324
01:54:50.195 --> 01:54:51.822
Bittner? You there?

1325
01:54:51.822 --> 01:54:52.864
In the flesh.

1326
01:55:23.645 --> 01:55:25.564
They lived their hopes
and dreams


1327
01:55:25.564 --> 01:55:28.859
buried in her lavish woods
and polished decks.


1328
01:55:28.859 --> 01:55:34.364
Now, resting and all
but forgotten,
they wait to return to life.


1329
01:55:35.991 --> 01:55:39.244
In a few moments,
the new Ghosts and Legends tour,


1330
01:55:39.244 --> 01:55:40.871
No Escape,

1331
01:55:40.912 --> 01:55:44.249
will disembark from
the grand staircase
on the promenade level.


1332
01:55:45.125 --> 01:55:47.044
Join our resident guides

1333
01:55:47.044 --> 01:55:50.589
as they lead you into the depths
of the RMS Queen Mary


1334
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:55.427
in an effort to connect
with spirits
who still call this ship home.


1335
01:55:56.178 --> 01:56:01.141
That's Ghosts and Legends,
No Escape, departing soon.
