5
00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.304
Hi!

6
00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:03.724
[audience cheering]

7
00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:08.479
[music fades and ends]

8
00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:09.438
Hi.

9
00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:12.942
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

10
00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:15.778
Wowee, good evening, everyone.

11
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:18.280
[audience cheering]

12
00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:23.243
It is cool to be here. [laughs]

13
00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:25.871
I did my dressage,
so now I feel good.

14
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:30.125
Hi, everyone. How are you feeling?

15
00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.003
[audience cheering]

16
00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:35.798
That sounds awesome.

17
00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:40.177
I am just jacked up
on the vibes of this spooky theater.


18
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.720
[audience laughing]

19
00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:45.474
Ah, to perform in
a ruin, I mean, whoo.

20
00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:50.229
- On a slice of eternity... [grunts]
- [audience laughing]


21
00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:52.898
Honestly, thank you. Yeah.

22
00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:57.152
Um, this theater reminds me
of what I think


23
00:01:57.236 --> 00:02:00.531
that the play
<i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> is about.


24
00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:02.825
[audience laughing]

25
00:02:02.908 --> 00:02:06.412
Obviously, I'm too afraid to see that play
'cause they made the title too scary.


26
00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:07.579
[audience laughing]

27
00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:12.084
And also, not to, like,
be like this right away,


28
00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:14.086
but, like, I don't wanna see a play.

29
00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.463
[audience laughing and applauding]

30
00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:20.426
Are you fucking kidding me? Like...
[groans]


31
00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.720
I honestly, like, don't get it.

32
00:02:22.803 --> 00:02:25.597
Like, I just, I'm just, like,
I'm not sure I understand you.


33
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:27.558
Like, okay, so what is it?

34
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:30.144
It's like the curtain comes up

35
00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:32.771
- and then like...
- [audience laughing]


36
00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.607
...a person comes out.
And they're like a person


37
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:38.527
and you can see them
and they're like clip-clomp-clomp.


38
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.988
They're like... 
[panting] "Mamma!"

39
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.906
[audience laughing]

40
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.784
You're like, "I know you're you."

41
00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:47.411
[audience laughing]

42
00:02:47.494 --> 00:02:50.622
"I know your name is, like, Kaitlyn,
I saw the playbill. What is this?"


43
00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:52.499
I don't get it. Um...

44
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.171
You're like, "Ah,
that sounds like the complaint


45
00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:59.673
of an actress who was not asked
to be in a play."


46
00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:01.800
- [audience laughing]
- Um...


47
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.219
I am here tonight

48
00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:07.014
because a hypnotist told me
that I'm a seasoned professional


49
00:03:07.097 --> 00:03:09.183
and I believe it
now deep in my psyche.

50
00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:12.686
- [audience cheering and applauding]
- Thank you so much.


51
00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:21.070
I do believe it. I put in the hours.
But, um, I am here, I do this


52
00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:26.241
because I just wanna, like,
share as much as possible,


53
00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:28.952
like as much as you can share
without going to jail.


54
00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:31.705
Um, that's my limit.

55
00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.624
And so, um,

56
00:03:33.707 --> 00:03:37.169
I would just like to, like, start off
by being very intimate


57
00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:40.547
and say hello, my name is Jenny Slate.

58
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:43.092
And I am addicted to microphones.

59
00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:44.718
[audience laughing]

60
00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:47.471
I don't wanna, like,
bum us all out, um,

61
00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:50.974
by talking about the pandemic right away,
but I think, like,


62
00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:52.601
our community needs this conversation,

63
00:03:52.684 --> 00:03:56.438
which is, like, I think
this was the hardest thing for all of us,


64
00:03:56.522 --> 00:03:58.524
um, during lockdown,

65
00:03:58.607 --> 00:04:02.945
which was that, like,
we couldn't get on the mic every day.


66
00:04:03.028 --> 00:04:03.987
[audience laughing]

67
00:04:04.071 --> 00:04:05.989
You know, like,
I think that was, like, very difficult


68
00:04:06.073 --> 00:04:09.743
to not be able to just, like,
immediately process your psyche


69
00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:11.787
to like 300 to 1,200 people.

70
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.667
I did get to use a microphone
during the pandemic,


71
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.838
um, but it was, um,
it was during my wedding.


72
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.383
'Cause both of us
have Boomer dads with hearing aids.


73
00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:25.717
[audience laughing]

74
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:28.262
And they're constantly
walking into the ocean with them on,


75
00:04:28.345 --> 00:04:29.555
being like, "Goddammit!"

76
00:04:29.638 --> 00:04:31.849
[audience laughing]

77
00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:33.851
My mom's, like, calling me up. She's like,

78
00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:37.980
"Your dad walked into the JCC pool
with his hearing aid again."


79
00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:40.065
[audience laughing]

80
00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:42.109
[groans] Snooze.

81
00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:44.444
Call a different daughter.

82
00:04:44.528 --> 00:04:46.155
[audience laughing]

83
00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:48.657
Fuck you, Nancy, you gave me everything!

84
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.453
My mom's really nice. Um...

85
00:04:53.537 --> 00:04:56.206
She really let me use her MasterCard
for a long time


86
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.334
- and I've never paid her back. Um...
- [audience laughing]


87
00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:01.086
You idiot!

88
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.297
Uh... [giggles]

89
00:05:04.798 --> 00:05:08.552
And, uh, clock this as the time
when my mom turns this comedy special off.


90
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.764
She's like, "I'm turning in, Ron." Um...

91
00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:14.683
Yeah, I had a mic during our wedding

92
00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:16.810
'cause we wanted our dads
to hear our vows.


93
00:05:16.894 --> 00:05:19.688
Um, even though they were five feet away.
And, um...


94
00:05:20.898 --> 00:05:24.943
I swear, like,
I got that mic in my little paw...


95
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:31.408
It was like, okay, like,
I truly, like, I was like,


96
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:34.703
everything inside of me
had to stop myself from just being like,


97
00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:37.789
"What's the deal with going
to the dentist? Help me figure this out."


98
00:05:37.873 --> 00:05:39.499
You know, it was like, chill.

99
00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:43.879
Just walk down the isle,
and tell the best person you've ever met


100
00:05:43.962 --> 00:05:46.006
that you hope
they'll fucking marry you right now.


101
00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.965
Just stop being weird.

102
00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:49.718
Like, this is my rule, like,
when you're getting married,


103
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:52.262
or when you're in therapy,
it's just, like,


104
00:05:52.346 --> 00:05:53.222
be real.

105
00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:56.558
[audience laughing]

106
00:05:56.642 --> 00:05:59.436
Don't just, like, try to make them laugh
so that they'll never leave.


107
00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.980
[high-pitched laugh]

108
00:06:02.064 --> 00:06:03.815
[audience laughing]

109
00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:04.816
[high-pitched] You hearing me?

110
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.319
[audience laughing]

111
00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:11.657
Oh, um, okay, and then the other thing

112
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.243
that I think I should say,
just so that, like, I set the scene


113
00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:15.827
and you know
who you're dealing with tonight


114
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:18.163
in terms of where my identity is, um...

115
00:06:19.122 --> 00:06:25.128
I'm trying to make an effort to say
the word, um, "breasts" more, like...


116
00:06:25.212 --> 00:06:26.546
[audience laughing]

117
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.757
Not just like "breasts," like randomly,

118
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.968
- but, like, um...
- [audience laughing]


119
00:06:31.051 --> 00:06:34.471
But, yeah, I started saying "breasts," um,

120
00:06:34.554 --> 00:06:39.226
because, like, have you ever
wanted to seem smart, um,


121
00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:41.353
for the doctor,

122
00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:43.313
so that they won't give up on you?

123
00:06:43.397 --> 00:06:45.565
[audience laughing]

124
00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:48.360
Maybe you don't have this problem,
but, like,


125
00:06:48.443 --> 00:06:52.531
I recently found myself
moments away from being like,


126
00:06:52.614 --> 00:06:54.283
"So are we doing a titty exam

127
00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:56.910
or are you just gonna
take a peek-a-roonie at my pussy?"


128
00:06:56.994 --> 00:06:59.079
[audience laughing]

129
00:06:59.162 --> 00:07:02.916
But speaking of, um, my titties, honestly,

130
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.461
um, just to put it
in a sentence for you, like,


131
00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:10.382
how I'm using my new,
my new vocabulary. Um...


132
00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:14.469
My breasts, um,

133
00:07:14.553 --> 00:07:16.888
before I had my baby,

134
00:07:16.972 --> 00:07:19.016
my breasts were like, uh,

135
00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:21.226
they were just like a full B.

136
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.186
It was, like, clink, hi, I'm Jenny,

137
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.856
I can go to any synagogue,
I've got a full B for you here,


138
00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:27.024
it's not a big deal.

139
00:07:27.107 --> 00:07:29.192
[audience laughing]

140
00:07:29.276 --> 00:07:31.653
You know, um, it
was sort of like, like,

141
00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:33.488
have you ever eaten a meal
where you're like,


142
00:07:33.572 --> 00:07:36.783
it was like a small bowl of pasta,
at, like, a fancy restaurant,


143
00:07:36.867 --> 00:07:38.035
and you're like, "This is all I get?"

144
00:07:38.118 --> 00:07:40.329
But then you eat it, and you're like,
"I'm actually full."


145
00:07:40.412 --> 00:07:43.915
[audience cheering and applauding]

146
00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:47.294
Um, yeah, so there was that

147
00:07:47.377 --> 00:07:49.129
and then I had my daughter

148
00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:51.214
and I was breastfeeding her.

149
00:07:51.298 --> 00:07:54.843
And to my wild surprise,

150
00:07:54.926 --> 00:07:56.219
I...

151
00:07:56.303 --> 00:07:57.971
was blessed

152
00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:02.976
with, like, an instant set
of fucking porny gazongas.


153
00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:09.358
Like, double D, milky, psycho naturals.

154
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:11.651
[audience laughing]

155
00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:14.029
I was agog. I really was.

156
00:08:14.112 --> 00:08:17.282
Like, I just, like,
I looked into the mirror


157
00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:20.327
and, like, bro'ed out so hard.

158
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.745
[audience laughing]

159
00:08:21.828 --> 00:08:25.832
I, like, negged myself
looking at these jugs.


160
00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:28.960
I was like... [deeper voice] "Oh, like,

161
00:08:29.044 --> 00:08:33.382
honestly, I don't usually think
that funny girls are attractive..."


162
00:08:33.465 --> 00:08:36.301
[audience laughing and applauding]

163
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:43.141
"...but, like,
you've caught my attention tonight, girl."


164
00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:45.894
[audience laughing]

165
00:08:45.977 --> 00:08:48.105
Yeah, and then

166
00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:51.191
I was, like, so
horny for my own physique,

167
00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:53.819
I just was like...
[slurping sounds]


168
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.072
Really wanted to just, like,
set up my phone


169
00:08:57.155 --> 00:09:00.409
and, like, make it slow-mo,
and just like, jump up and down.


170
00:09:00.492 --> 00:09:02.244
[audience laughing]

171
00:09:02.327 --> 00:09:05.205
Oh, but also, they, like,
really, really hurt, really bad.


172
00:09:05.288 --> 00:09:09.167
Um, yeah, that's the compromise. Whoo.
Um...


173
00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:11.420
After I had my baby, um,

174
00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:13.380
I just thought, you know, this is,

175
00:09:13.463 --> 00:09:15.841
they're, okay, maybe
I'm not gonna keep having double D's,


176
00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:20.470
but, like, I'll probably just stay with,
like, a full C or something.


177
00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:24.391
And instead, it was, like,
have you ever, like, let a balloon go?


178
00:09:24.474 --> 00:09:27.269
And it's just like...
[balloon deflating sounds]


179
00:09:27.352 --> 00:09:28.937
And then it just falls on the floor?

180
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.440
- Like, I was, like, no!
- [audience laughing]


181
00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:36.361
But, like, now I would say
that my breasts are, like,


182
00:09:36.445 --> 00:09:39.531
they're like a hybrid
between a pancake and a feather.


183
00:09:39.614 --> 00:09:42.951
[audience laughing]

184
00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:44.286
It's erotic.

185
00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:45.412
It's erotic.

186
00:09:45.495 --> 00:09:47.914
My husband says it's very erotic. Um...

187
00:09:47.998 --> 00:09:50.459
It's, like, almost all nip.
That's surprising.


188
00:09:50.542 --> 00:09:52.377
[audience laughing]

189
00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:54.254
Whoa, you know, and, like,

190
00:09:54.337 --> 00:09:58.091
I love it, 'cause I feel like
they remind me of, like,


191
00:09:58.175 --> 00:10:01.595
the little strict little titties that,
like, a ballerina would have.


192
00:10:01.678 --> 00:10:03.180
[audience laughing]

193
00:10:03.263 --> 00:10:06.224
You know? These are my fucking titties.

194
00:10:06.308 --> 00:10:08.768
Mm. If you want it,
you'd better fucking find it.


195
00:10:08.852 --> 00:10:12.105
[audience laughing]

196
00:10:12.189 --> 00:10:14.316
I do feel like
I kind of, I didn't,

197
00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:17.360
I sort of name-dropped
that I had a baby.

198
00:10:17.444 --> 00:10:21.198
- Like, I saw her, I know her, but, um...
- [audience laughing]


199
00:10:21.281 --> 00:10:24.201
But she's mine, um, 
I have a baby.

200
00:10:24.284 --> 00:10:27.287
She's, um, perfect and wonderful
and I don't have a joke about her


201
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.081
'cause I would never
fucking joke about her.


202
00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:33.335
Um. Um, but, yeah, I had a baby,

203
00:10:33.418 --> 00:10:35.253
I'm not trying to skirt the issue,

204
00:10:35.337 --> 00:10:36.796
or, like, deny it.

205
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.925
Like, I, I did
it. I... I did it.

206
00:10:40.008 --> 00:10:41.134
[audience laughing]

207
00:10:41.218 --> 00:10:42.093
She's there.

208
00:10:42.177 --> 00:10:44.971
But, like, it does still feel like,
I'm, like, it was me?


209
00:10:45.055 --> 00:10:47.057
Like, I did it? Like, I...

210
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.559
It's hard to wrap my mind around it
and, like...


211
00:10:49.643 --> 00:10:51.853
I was pregnant for a long time

212
00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:53.355
and I understood that I was,

213
00:10:53.438 --> 00:10:57.484
but, like, even on
the way to the hospital

214
00:10:57.567 --> 00:11:01.863
when my body was, like, really hurting
and stuff was starting to leak out...


215
00:11:01.947 --> 00:11:03.281
[audience laughing]

216
00:11:03.365 --> 00:11:04.658
I was just, like...

217
00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:08.161
kinda feels like someone's
gonna sub in here, though.


218
00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:11.623
[audience laughing]

219
00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:16.127
Like, it's just such an extreme experience
that I just was like, I don't kn...


220
00:11:16.211 --> 00:11:18.755
It just doesn't feel like something
I would do, you know?


221
00:11:18.838 --> 00:11:20.382
[audience laughing]

222
00:11:23.093 --> 00:11:26.846
Like, would I knock on someone's door
after four dates at 2:00 a.m. and be like,


223
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.141
"I just need to tell you
I'm in love with you." Like, yeah.


224
00:11:30.225 --> 00:11:34.020
Extreme stuff, I've done it. But, like,
this? I was like, "Oh, I don't know."


225
00:11:34.104 --> 00:11:37.315
It just doesn't seem like
what she would do and, like,


226
00:11:38.233 --> 00:11:41.611
anytime something's been hard
or I haven't wanted to do it,


227
00:11:41.695 --> 00:11:44.906
like, I've always
just been able to quit or be fired.


228
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.825
[audience laughing]

229
00:11:46.908 --> 00:11:48.827
It's just so, it just felt like,

230
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.122
I just don't feel like
this was meant to be sent,


231
00:11:52.205 --> 00:11:54.416
I wanted to have the
baby, but I was like,

232
00:11:54.499 --> 00:11:56.793
"Did you mean for me to do this, though?"
Like...


233
00:11:57.794 --> 00:12:01.631
The only other thing
that I had to compare to it


234
00:12:01.715 --> 00:12:05.677
was, um, just the memory of this one time
when I opened my email


235
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.515
and I had received, um, an audition
for the role of Pennywise in the movie <i>It</i>.


236
00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:13.393
[audience laughing]

237
00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:18.857
Yeah.

238
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.859
I would love for you
to all to be like,

239
00:12:20.942 --> 00:12:23.236
"What a funny, fictional joke
that she's telling."


240
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.988
[audience laughing]

241
00:12:25.071 --> 00:12:27.699
"About a fucking fake thing
that never happened


242
00:12:27.782 --> 00:12:29.409
to a nice person like she."

243
00:12:29.492 --> 00:12:31.244
[audience laughing]

244
00:12:31.328 --> 00:12:33.330
But, in fact,

245
00:12:33.413 --> 00:12:34.998
I opened my email. It's like,

246
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:37.667
"An appointment has been made
on your behalf


247
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:40.712
to audition for the role of Pennywise."

248
00:12:40.795 --> 00:12:41.671
I was like...

249
00:12:44.883 --> 00:12:45.759
"Huh?"

250
00:12:45.842 --> 00:12:47.052
[audience laughing]

251
00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:49.596
Like, I just, I truly was like,
"Wait. Huh?"


252
00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:51.389
Like, no, like, that couldn't be...

253
00:12:52.682 --> 00:12:53.558
Like the...

254
00:12:56.186 --> 00:12:57.771
Like the murdering...

255
00:12:57.854 --> 00:12:59.606
[audience laughing]

256
00:12:59.689 --> 00:13:00.940
...kidnapping...

257
00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:04.235
balding, male clown, right?

258
00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:05.862
[audience laughing]

259
00:13:08.114 --> 00:13:11.409
[short gasps] Like...

260
00:13:11.493 --> 00:13:13.912
And then I'm, like, such an optimist
and I was like,


261
00:13:13.995 --> 00:13:15.705
well, maybe it's, like,
something else, like,


262
00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:19.209
maybe this is actually, like,
best-case scenario, like,


263
00:13:19.292 --> 00:13:21.211
a very antisemitic romcom about...

264
00:13:21.294 --> 00:13:23.380
[audience laughing]

265
00:13:23.463 --> 00:13:26.675
Like, like, a whimsical woman
who, like, can't get it together,


266
00:13:26.758 --> 00:13:28.927
named, like, Penny Wise.
And, like... [farting sound]


267
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.428
[audience laughing]

268
00:13:30.512 --> 00:13:33.348
She, like, fucking farted while she was
picking up her panties, or something.


269
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:34.724
I don't know.

270
00:13:34.808 --> 00:13:37.727
I don't care. Literally anything

271
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:41.481
but imagining producers...

272
00:13:41.564 --> 00:13:44.025
[audience laughing]

273
00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:45.318
...sitting around...

274
00:13:45.402 --> 00:13:47.570
[audience laughing]

275
00:13:47.654 --> 00:13:49.447
...when they've got all the SkarsgÃ¥rds...

276
00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:52.784
[audience laughing]

277
00:13:52.867 --> 00:13:55.328
And being like, "Oh, 
I don't know, like,

278
00:13:55.412 --> 00:13:57.997
what if we did, like,
a Jenny Slate kind of thing with this?"


279
00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:00.875
[audience laughing]

280
00:14:02.544 --> 00:14:06.840
And just, like, two men
and a female misogynist being like,


281
00:14:06.923 --> 00:14:08.383
"That's interesting, Trey."

282
00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:12.178
[audience laughing]

283
00:14:12.262 --> 00:14:15.807
"There is something there, honestly.
That's fucked up."


284
00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:18.768
Or, like,

285
00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:22.313
my representatives at the time,
who I do not work with anymore...


286
00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:26.735
[audience cheering and applauding]

287
00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:29.571
Being like, "Let's fucking see
if this idiot bites." You know, like...


288
00:14:29.654 --> 00:14:30.989
[audience laughing]

289
00:14:31.072 --> 00:14:34.826
[giggles] It really,
really hurt my feelings.


290
00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:38.621
It really hurt my feelings
really badly. Um...


291
00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:40.498
And then I got really scared

292
00:14:40.582 --> 00:14:44.169
because I was like, "Imagine
if I fucking went on this audition."


293
00:14:45.378 --> 00:14:47.380
Like, you know how there are,
like, leaked tapes


294
00:14:47.464 --> 00:14:49.299
of, like, people who try to do stuff.

295
00:14:49.382 --> 00:14:51.760
[audience laughing]

296
00:14:51.843 --> 00:14:52.844
Can you imagine?

297
00:14:52.927 --> 00:14:55.513
However I did, would've done my hair
and I'm like...


298
00:14:55.597 --> 00:15:00.977
[audience laughing and applauding]

299
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.772
Ah! It hurts my feelings so much!

300
00:15:04.939 --> 00:15:09.027
And so we got to the hospital.
[clears throat] And, um, I, um,


301
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.863
I mean, I'm just gonna try
to make this, you know, brief, um,


302
00:15:11.946 --> 00:15:17.035
but I had the
baby out of my vagina.

303
00:15:17.118 --> 00:15:20.163
[audience cheering and applauding]

304
00:15:20.246 --> 00:15:21.122
Yeah.

305
00:15:22.582 --> 00:15:24.542
She's here tonight! 
Bring her out!

306
00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:26.878
[audience laughing]

307
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:28.630
It's this one, that's the craziest thing.

308
00:15:28.713 --> 00:15:30.256
Isn't that so weird? It's this.

309
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.718
It's like, just like that, like,
this is my pussy, it's my vagina.


310
00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:36.805
I did it out of this.
You don't get another one.


311
00:15:36.888 --> 00:15:38.056
[audience laughing]

312
00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:40.433
It's not, like, "Oh,
she dropped her ice cream cone,


313
00:15:40.517 --> 00:15:42.727
but she's a good girl,
she can have another," like...


314
00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:43.853
[audience laughing]

315
00:15:43.937 --> 00:15:47.649
You have it and you keep it
and you take with it, forever.


316
00:15:47.732 --> 00:15:50.527
Uh, the truth, which is,

317
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.445
and again,
not sure where the joke is here,


318
00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:55.532
and I would've loved to have
figured it out before we filmed, but...


319
00:15:55.615 --> 00:15:56.699
[audience laughing]

320
00:15:56.783 --> 00:15:59.869
You know, you can plan for your birth.

321
00:15:59.953 --> 00:16:01.913
You can have the plan and the playlist

322
00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:04.749
and if you're lucky,
you have a lovely partner,


323
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:08.461
or support people, or doctors,
or whatever you want,


324
00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:10.463
and you can really, really do that,

325
00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:12.131
but the fact is that
when you're doing it,


326
00:16:12.215 --> 00:16:13.758
you are essentially alone.

327
00:16:13.842 --> 00:16:15.760
[audience laughing softly]

328
00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:16.886
Okay.

329
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.556
[audience laughing]

330
00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:22.600
Oh, that doesn't tickle
your funny bone? Um...


331
00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:24.853
[audience laughing]

332
00:16:28.147 --> 00:16:32.694
[exhales] It was, giving birth, for me,

333
00:16:32.777 --> 00:16:34.696
was a very positive experience

334
00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:36.656
and, like, again, like,
not because I'm like,


335
00:16:36.739 --> 00:16:38.449
"Oh, I'm perfect and it went perfectly,"

336
00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:43.663
but, like, just because, um, like,
I liked, I liked the feelings,


337
00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:45.748
I guess, that I, that I had.

338
00:16:45.832 --> 00:16:49.836
And, um, I also like the response
that I got from my husband,


339
00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:51.296
like, he was very supportive.

340
00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:53.631
And then after the fact, he was like,

341
00:16:53.715 --> 00:16:57.719
"Watching the baby come out of your vagina
was like watching a magic trick."


342
00:16:57.802 --> 00:17:00.013
[audience laughing]

343
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.105
You know those magicians...

344
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.026
that just get up on stage and...

345
00:17:13.943 --> 00:17:16.696
scream for 21 hours straight?

346
00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:18.615
[audience laughing]

347
00:17:18.698 --> 00:17:23.202
Where the, uh, the magician, um,
just does that famous trick


348
00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:27.540
where they just shit out
every shit they'll ever make


349
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:30.752
in their whole entire life.

350
00:17:31.586 --> 00:17:35.089
Plus, like, callbacks to shits gone by.

351
00:17:35.173 --> 00:17:36.382
[audience laughing]

352
00:17:36.466 --> 00:17:39.594
And, like, future shits
we haven't even invented yet


353
00:17:39.677 --> 00:17:42.055
'cause we don't have that kind of food,
or whatever.


354
00:17:42.138 --> 00:17:43.932
[audience laughing]

355
00:17:44.015 --> 00:17:47.143
You know, much like, uh, uh,
when they, like, take the scarf


356
00:17:47.226 --> 00:17:48.895
out of their tuxedo, or whatever.

357
00:17:49.729 --> 00:17:52.065
Except, imagine that the scarf
is full of shit.


358
00:17:52.148 --> 00:17:54.484
[audience laughing]

359
00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:58.947
[giggles] Um, yeah, I mean,
a birth is a portal.


360
00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.699
It's a portal.
You are touching infinity.


361
00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:04.786
You're bringing someone in.
You yourself are changing.


362
00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:10.375
And also, you will make shits
that directly rocket you back...


363
00:18:10.458 --> 00:18:12.502
[audience laughing]

364
00:18:12.585 --> 00:18:15.588
...to other times
where you were emotionally impacted.


365
00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:17.006
[deep inhale]

366
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:21.928
And there was, like, this one...

367
00:18:22.011 --> 00:18:23.179
doody that I made...

368
00:18:23.262 --> 00:18:25.264
[audience laughing]

369
00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:26.849
...during my labor...

370
00:18:28.184 --> 00:18:33.773
where, I mean, I was like,
"Oh, my God, I know you."


371
00:18:33.856 --> 00:18:37.777
[audience laughing]

372
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.363
I was like, "No way! Like..."

373
00:18:40.446 --> 00:18:43.324
[audience laughing]

374
00:18:43.408 --> 00:18:47.286
"You're from the orchestra trip
to Montreal in seventh grade?"


375
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.330
[audience laughing]

376
00:18:49.414 --> 00:18:51.916
"I fucking know you, man.
I know you from Canada."


377
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.128
Little bit about me at that moment,
I was, like, in seventh grade.


378
00:18:55.211 --> 00:18:56.963
I was, like, two-eleven.

379
00:18:57.046 --> 00:19:00.133
[audience laughing]

380
00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:01.843
Terrible at the violin.

381
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.220
And everyone fucking hated me.

382
00:19:04.303 --> 00:19:06.806
[audience laughing]

383
00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:08.599
Um...

384
00:19:08.683 --> 00:19:11.352
Yeah, uh, and so before
we went on the trip,


385
00:19:11.436 --> 00:19:14.313
my mom, um, was like, "Jenny,

386
00:19:14.397 --> 00:19:17.400
remember to take your lactate pills."

387
00:19:17.483 --> 00:19:18.693
And I was like, "Yeah, right,

388
00:19:18.776 --> 00:19:21.320
I don't want anyone to actually confirm
that I'm a dork, so..."


389
00:19:21.404 --> 00:19:25.908
We went, we got taken
to the Hard Rock CafÃ© Montreal.


390
00:19:25.992 --> 00:19:28.411
[audience laughing softly]

391
00:19:30.204 --> 00:19:35.251
Which I might define as the least
Jewish place in the entire world.


392
00:19:35.334 --> 00:19:37.462
[audience laughing]

393
00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:41.132
And I had never been to a restaurant
without my parents before.


394
00:19:41.215 --> 00:19:42.800
I was, like, fucking off the leash.

395
00:19:42.884 --> 00:19:45.428
I just was, like,
"Oh, I can't believe this!" And...


396
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:49.098
I got, I got sat at a table
of popular kids


397
00:19:49.182 --> 00:19:52.185
and I was, like, expecting someone
to just be like, "Get up!"


398
00:19:52.268 --> 00:19:54.729
But, like, nobody seemed to notice,
so I was like, "Mm,


399
00:19:54.812 --> 00:19:57.356
just don't fuck this up
for yourself." Um...


400
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.025
I just was like, "Just stay here

401
00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:01.360
and maybe, like, stay next to them
and maybe they'll never ask you to leave,"


402
00:20:01.444 --> 00:20:04.363
which, honestly, has served me in
some other relationships later on in life.


403
00:20:04.447 --> 00:20:06.449
- But, um...
- [audience laughing]


404
00:20:06.532 --> 00:20:09.202
So, this kid...

405
00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:11.287
in my memory,

406
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:16.542
is like, "Okay, so we'll do, um,
double cheese pizza,


407
00:20:16.626 --> 00:20:19.504
uh, we're gonna do mozzarella sticks
for the table.


408
00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:22.298
You guys want mozza sticks?
Okay, cool. Uh...


409
00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:26.260
Uh, loaded nachos, and fully load them,
sour cream as well.


410
00:20:26.344 --> 00:20:29.889
And then a round of milkshakes
for everyone."


411
00:20:29.972 --> 00:20:30.890
[audience laughing]

412
00:20:30.973 --> 00:20:33.059
"That good? That good?
Is that what you guys wanna do?"


413
00:20:33.142 --> 00:20:35.937
I was like, "Oh, yeah, totally cool, man.

414
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.188
To... Yeah."

415
00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:40.191
[audience laughing softly]

416
00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:43.611
These fucking popular Christian kids
ordering so much dairy...


417
00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:46.114
[audience laughing]

418
00:20:46.197 --> 00:20:48.491
I'm like, "Fake it till you make it.

419
00:20:48.574 --> 00:20:50.743
Like, we're in another country.
Maybe I'm not myself."


420
00:20:50.827 --> 00:20:53.746
- And, um...
- [audience laughing]


421
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.708
[clears throat] And I, you know,
you're supposed to take,


422
00:20:57.792 --> 00:21:03.589
I guess, like, one to two lactate pills
with every dairy item.


423
00:21:03.673 --> 00:21:06.467
And in my case,
I took zero with a million.


424
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:08.803
[audience laughing]

425
00:21:08.886 --> 00:21:11.556
I was super fucking pumped.

426
00:21:11.639 --> 00:21:14.600
I was, like, feasting at the king's table.

427
00:21:14.684 --> 00:21:16.811
I'm, like, throwing down
these mozzarella sticks.


428
00:21:16.894 --> 00:21:19.647
Like, I'm just, like,
a walrus with her mackerel.


429
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.568
- I'm like... [guzzling sounds]
- [audience laughing]


430
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:26.487
Like, fracking the bottom of my milkshake.

431
00:21:26.571 --> 00:21:30.074
Just being like, "Get it all!"

432
00:21:30.158 --> 00:21:33.744
[audience laughing]

433
00:21:33.828 --> 00:21:37.957
I got up from this
table and I was like,

434
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.251
like, I could hear my sphincter yelling.

435
00:21:40.334 --> 00:21:42.044
Like, "We can't hold that!"

436
00:21:42.128 --> 00:21:43.296
[audience laughing]

437
00:21:43.379 --> 00:21:45.339
I was like this, like, 
I was, like...

438
00:21:45.423 --> 00:21:47.884
[audience laughing]

439
00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:51.262
"Okay, that was so cool to hang out
with all of you guys."


440
00:21:51.345 --> 00:21:54.974
[audience laughing]

441
00:21:56.184 --> 00:21:57.894
And in my memory,

442
00:21:57.977 --> 00:22:00.313
which in order to access
for your benefit tonight,


443
00:22:00.396 --> 00:22:02.732
I have to, like, push through
a curtain of trauma.


444
00:22:02.815 --> 00:22:04.442
'Cause it's, like, on the other side.

445
00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:06.944
It's, like, one of the worst things
that's ever occurred.


446
00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:08.446
In my memory,

447
00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:11.282
uh, at the Hard Rock CafÃ© Montreal,

448
00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:15.161
um, there are, like, 250 stairs down...

449
00:22:15.244 --> 00:22:16.829
[audience laughing]

450
00:22:16.913 --> 00:22:18.289
...out of the restaurant.

451
00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.000
And, uh...

452
00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:25.755
I lost a little bit of weight
on every stair. You know what I mean.


453
00:22:25.838 --> 00:22:27.882
[audience gasping and laughing]

454
00:22:27.965 --> 00:22:29.508
Yeah.

455
00:22:29.592 --> 00:22:30.468
Yeah.

456
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:34.305
Like, this was, like,
a full peacock tail...


457
00:22:34.388 --> 00:22:37.516
[audience laughing]

458
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.060
...of diarrhea...

459
00:22:39.143 --> 00:22:41.604
[audience laughing]

460
00:22:43.231 --> 00:22:46.734
- ...in a restaurant. And...
- [audience laughing]


461
00:22:46.817 --> 00:22:47.860
[sighs] You know...

462
00:22:50.196 --> 00:22:51.822
I, I like to be positive.

463
00:22:51.906 --> 00:22:54.575
One thing that I really like
about myself, um...


464
00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:59.163
is that I feel
that as a living thing,

465
00:22:59.247 --> 00:23:01.999
I'm, like, very in tune with my, like,
mammal rhythms.


466
00:23:02.083 --> 00:23:05.378
Like, even as, like, a young,
young, young person,


467
00:23:05.461 --> 00:23:09.006
I was, like, oh, like,
I dunno, like, do you know that feeling,


468
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.093
like, when you can tell
that you're about to pass away?


469
00:23:12.176 --> 00:23:14.220
[audience laughing]

470
00:23:17.014 --> 00:23:22.061
It's just like a deep, still know,
and you're like, "Oh.


471
00:23:22.144 --> 00:23:25.273
- I'm about to pass."
- [audience laughing]


472
00:23:25.356 --> 00:23:28.067
Like, did you ever have
a childhood pet that, like,


473
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.652
went away to die,

474
00:23:29.735 --> 00:23:34.448
like, like, a cat that, like, went behind
the computer table to just die?


475
00:23:34.532 --> 00:23:36.867
[audience laughing softly]

476
00:23:40.371 --> 00:23:43.624
If there's any Gen Z-ers in the audience,
they're like, "Computer table?"


477
00:23:43.708 --> 00:23:46.836
[audience laughing]

478
00:23:50.923 --> 00:23:53.926
"The computer's in your body now,
you idiot!"


479
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.886
[audience laughing]

480
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.938
You know, like, your friend would be like,
"We couldn't find Oreo for three days.


481
00:24:06.022 --> 00:24:09.942
And then my aunt looked
behind the computer table.


482
00:24:10.026 --> 00:24:13.029
And Oreo had, like,
pushed out one smoke-colored shit


483
00:24:13.112 --> 00:24:14.780
and then Oreo ended."

484
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.075
That's what I was like.
I was like, "She's gone!"


485
00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:19.869
And I was like, "Oh, 
I'm about to die.

486
00:24:19.952 --> 00:24:22.747
Like, I better go subterranean
and just, like, fucking find my grave."


487
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.332
- And...
- [audience laughing]


488
00:24:24.415 --> 00:24:26.625
I ducked into an underground mall

489
00:24:26.709 --> 00:24:29.503
um, as, like, a tiny seventh-grader, like,

490
00:24:29.587 --> 00:24:31.172
found a bathroom

491
00:24:31.255 --> 00:24:35.259
and alternated between propulsive diarrhea

492
00:24:35.343 --> 00:24:38.512
- and expressive vomit.
- [audience groans]


493
00:24:38.596 --> 00:24:42.350
- I know, thank you so much, honestly.
- [audience laughing]


494
00:24:42.433 --> 00:24:45.019
I would love to just get
a voice memo of that


495
00:24:45.102 --> 00:24:46.687
so I can masturbate to it later.

496
00:24:46.771 --> 00:24:50.941
[audience cheering and laughing]

497
00:24:53.152 --> 00:24:55.529
And then, like,
have you ever just been barfing


498
00:24:55.613 --> 00:24:57.114
and you're getting so weak?

499
00:24:57.198 --> 00:24:59.700
You're, like, holding on the toilet,
and you're like,


500
00:24:59.784 --> 00:25:01.994
"You will not take me down."

501
00:25:02.078 --> 00:25:03.287
[audience laughing]

502
00:25:03.371 --> 00:25:07.458
But, like, obviously, I'm, like,
a very weak person in almost every way


503
00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:09.835
and I had to lay
my little body down, but...


504
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:16.092
Right before I laid down on the tile
in that underground mall,


505
00:25:16.175 --> 00:25:18.552
I looked into the toilet...

506
00:25:19.762 --> 00:25:23.140
and while I was having my baby,
I saw the exact same shit!


507
00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:25.351
[audience laughing and applauding]

508
00:25:25.434 --> 00:25:26.977
Thank you so much.

509
00:25:28.896 --> 00:25:29.772
Oh.

510
00:25:32.316 --> 00:25:35.236
For the birth... [laughs]

511
00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:37.655
...um, I had an epidural.

512
00:25:37.738 --> 00:25:42.034
Um, and if you
don't know what that is,

513
00:25:42.118 --> 00:25:44.787
I don't really care about
describing it to you to know.


514
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.916
[laughs] It's like, if you don't know
what that is, you should know.


515
00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:50.918
Like, I know what a fucking cummerbund is.

516
00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:53.504
[audience laughing]

517
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:57.383
[sighs] Um...

518
00:25:59.844 --> 00:26:03.013
Sassy, sassy, sassy, sassy.

519
00:26:03.097 --> 00:26:04.849
- Um...
- [audience laughing]


520
00:26:04.932 --> 00:26:07.351
So I, um, I had an epidural

521
00:26:07.435 --> 00:26:08.686
because I...

522
00:26:08.769 --> 00:26:10.729
Bye, hon! Um...

523
00:26:10.813 --> 00:26:12.940
[audience laughing]

524
00:26:13.023 --> 00:26:16.485
No, no, no, no, no, no!

525
00:26:16.569 --> 00:26:19.697
[audience laughing and applauding]

526
00:26:26.078 --> 00:26:28.080
Okay.

527
00:26:29.707 --> 00:26:31.000
I got an epidural

528
00:26:31.083 --> 00:26:32.418
because I really, really wanted one.

529
00:26:32.501 --> 00:26:35.296
Um, because I was really fucking scared
of how it would feel


530
00:26:35.379 --> 00:26:38.007
to have a baby come out
of my vagina. Um...


531
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:42.011
Yeah, I was not interested
in what that would feel like at all.


532
00:26:42.094 --> 00:26:45.598
Um, it's just really, really scary.
You explode. If you're lucky.


533
00:26:45.681 --> 00:26:48.267
When you have a baby,
if you're lucky, you explode your vagina.


534
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.561
That's the best thing
that can happen to you, so...


535
00:26:50.644 --> 00:26:53.230
Again, find the funny there. But, um...

536
00:26:53.314 --> 00:26:55.691
That's the best-case scenario,
is that you fucking explode.


537
00:26:55.774 --> 00:26:59.612
But, um, I really will say

538
00:26:59.695 --> 00:27:01.780
that I, I think

539
00:27:01.864 --> 00:27:07.369
that nobody has ever reacted as positively

540
00:27:07.453 --> 00:27:09.205
to an epidural

541
00:27:09.288 --> 00:27:10.998
as I did on that...

542
00:27:11.081 --> 00:27:11.957
that evening.

543
00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:14.418
Like, I, before I got the epidural,

544
00:27:14.502 --> 00:27:18.714
I was just like, "I can't! I can't!
I can't! I can't! I can't!"


545
00:27:18.797 --> 00:27:20.674
And then I got the epidural
and I was like,


546
00:27:20.758 --> 00:27:23.219
"So what's it like
to be from Santa Fe, man?"


547
00:27:23.302 --> 00:27:27.097
[audience laughing and cheering]

548
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:28.891
"Frickin' jamming in here, right now."

549
00:27:29.892 --> 00:27:32.061
I was like,
"Can I get another Italian ice?"


550
00:27:32.144 --> 00:27:34.772
[audience laughing]

551
00:27:34.855 --> 00:27:37.733
Eating the stupid, like, wooden spoon.

552
00:27:37.816 --> 00:27:40.611
Just, like, truly being, like,
"I'll take another," like, 40 minutes


553
00:27:40.694 --> 00:27:44.615
before I fully, like, rip myself
from clit to cornhole. Just, like...


554
00:27:44.698 --> 00:27:45.616
[audience laughing]

555
00:27:45.699 --> 00:27:49.078
...not concerned at all. [laughs]

556
00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:50.871
If anyone's pregnant tonight,

557
00:27:50.955 --> 00:27:51.830
I don't know.

558
00:27:51.914 --> 00:27:53.791
[audience laughing]

559
00:27:55.251 --> 00:27:57.127
Yeah, I honestly, yeah. Um...

560
00:27:58.546 --> 00:27:59.880
Um...

561
00:27:59.964 --> 00:28:05.344
[sighs] And then
after the baby was out of my body,


562
00:28:05.427 --> 00:28:08.931
and I had exploded my vagina,
as I feel like I might've said many times.


563
00:28:09.014 --> 00:28:11.809
It's really important to keep saying it
'cause it really did happen.


564
00:28:11.892 --> 00:28:14.812
And I will not be silenced!
Um, I exploded my vagina!


565
00:28:14.895 --> 00:28:17.356
Um... [chuckles] But, um...

566
00:28:18.524 --> 00:28:21.527
Like, 15 minutes
after that event occurred,


567
00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.613
you would think, like, I would get
a call from the Surgeon General


568
00:28:24.697 --> 00:28:27.283
being like, "Congrats.
That was, like, incredible."


569
00:28:27.366 --> 00:28:29.827
- But, um...
- [audience laughing]


570
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.537
It was pretty weird what happened.

571
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.248
First of all, the weird thing was
that I immediately was like,


572
00:28:34.331 --> 00:28:36.125
"I would like to watch <i>Paddington 2</i>."

573
00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:39.920
[audience laughing and applauding]

574
00:28:40.004 --> 00:28:42.298
<i>Paddington 2</i> is better than <i>Paddington 1</i>

575
00:28:42.381 --> 00:28:44.592
and <i>Paddington 1</i> fucking ruled.
So, anyway...


576
00:28:44.675 --> 00:28:46.552
If you've seen those movies,
you would know why,


577
00:28:46.635 --> 00:28:48.721
even right after giving birth,
you would be like,


578
00:28:48.804 --> 00:28:50.264
"I have a hankering for Paddington."

579
00:28:50.347 --> 00:28:53.058
Um, great cast. Really good. But, um...

580
00:28:54.768 --> 00:28:56.562
I wasn't allowed to watch it right away

581
00:28:56.645 --> 00:28:58.606
'cause they were like,
"You have something else to do right now."


582
00:28:58.689 --> 00:29:00.524
Um, which is, you know,
what parenthood is.


583
00:29:00.608 --> 00:29:02.234
It's not all about you. Um...

584
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.989
But 15 minutes later,
the nurse came in.


585
00:29:07.072 --> 00:29:09.241
Honestly, I thought she was just
gonna, like, hit me over the head


586
00:29:09.325 --> 00:29:11.368
with a frying pan
and be like, "You're done."


587
00:29:11.452 --> 00:29:13.579
She's like...

588
00:29:13.662 --> 00:29:14.538
"Okay.

589
00:29:14.622 --> 00:29:15.539
Go peepee."

590
00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.499
I was like...

591
00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:21.587
- "What?"
- [audience laughing]


592
00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.840
She's like, "Mm, mm, go peepee."

593
00:29:24.923 --> 00:29:26.717
[audience laughing]

594
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.385
I was like... [mocking laugh]

595
00:29:29.219 --> 00:29:32.264
Like, surely, I'm not gonna, like,

596
00:29:32.348 --> 00:29:33.974
get the worst injury of my life

597
00:29:34.058 --> 00:29:36.518
and then have to, like, pee out of it.
Right? Like...


598
00:29:36.602 --> 00:29:37.728
That seems weird to me.

599
00:29:37.811 --> 00:29:39.396
If you, like, cut
your arm, you'd be like,

600
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.316
"Don't get any peepee on there."
Like, I just...


601
00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:44.985
I was just, like,
why is all this stuff that's happening,


602
00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:47.446
like, it seems, like,
like the wrong medical advise


603
00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:48.864
and it's so weird.

604
00:29:48.947 --> 00:29:51.408
But, like, I guess
you gotta go peepee, or something.


605
00:29:51.492 --> 00:29:53.410
And then, and then,

606
00:29:53.494 --> 00:29:54.912
and then they're just like, "Bye!"

607
00:29:54.995 --> 00:29:56.538
And you just have to leave.

608
00:29:56.622 --> 00:29:57.873
[audience laughing]

609
00:29:57.956 --> 00:30:00.125
Like, you just have to go. 
It's so weird.

610
00:30:00.209 --> 00:30:02.544
And everyone's like, "How's the baby?"
And you're like...


611
00:30:02.628 --> 00:30:04.338
[shrieks] "Do you know
what just happened to me?"


612
00:30:04.421 --> 00:30:06.173
[audience laughing]

613
00:30:06.256 --> 00:30:10.302
But, honestly, like, if one man

614
00:30:10.386 --> 00:30:13.472
exploded a baby
out of the tip of his peepee...


615
00:30:13.555 --> 00:30:15.099
[audience laughing]

616
00:30:15.182 --> 00:30:17.434
...everyone would be like...

617
00:30:18.644 --> 00:30:20.062
"Did you hear about Scott?"

618
00:30:20.145 --> 00:30:22.564
[audience laughing]

619
00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:28.987
Like, collectively,
we'd be devastated for him.


620
00:30:29.071 --> 00:30:30.989
We've been trained to be devastated

621
00:30:31.073 --> 00:30:33.784
if anything ever happens to the peepees.
And, like...


622
00:30:34.743 --> 00:30:37.371
If, you know, like,
if you were at a party with Scott,


623
00:30:37.454 --> 00:30:39.581
like, you,
even if he had the worst personality,


624
00:30:39.665 --> 00:30:42.960
you'd, like, look right into his eyes
and, like, give him respect, you know.


625
00:30:43.043 --> 00:30:44.545
[audience laughing]

626
00:30:44.628 --> 00:30:49.299
Scott, like, got up from the dinner table
and was like, "Excuse me."


627
00:30:50.676 --> 00:30:52.261
"I have to go to the bathroom."

628
00:30:52.344 --> 00:30:55.347
Everyone would be like, "Scott!"

629
00:30:55.431 --> 00:30:57.725
[audience laughing]

630
00:30:57.808 --> 00:31:00.394
"Do you need us to hug you
from behind, Scott,


631
00:31:00.477 --> 00:31:01.687
while you do your peepee?"

632
00:31:03.439 --> 00:31:04.815
Um...

633
00:31:04.898 --> 00:31:06.525
Much like, I'm sure, all of you,

634
00:31:06.608 --> 00:31:09.319
I got pregnant
on the very first night of the pandemic.


635
00:31:09.403 --> 00:31:11.572
[audience laughing]

636
00:31:11.655 --> 00:31:13.449
Romantic, huh?

637
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.494
Um, what happened there... 
[clears throat]

638
00:31:17.578 --> 00:31:21.457
...was that, and I'm not about to, like,
describe sex to you. Don't worry.


639
00:31:22.416 --> 00:31:24.960
Um, what happened was that, like,

640
00:31:25.043 --> 00:31:28.672
we, my husband and I, were, like, okay,

641
00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:30.758
LA is, like, about to lock down

642
00:31:30.841 --> 00:31:33.552
and maybe we should just, like,
drive back to Massachusetts.


643
00:31:33.635 --> 00:31:37.431
And, like, before even just, like,
calmly, like, looking at each other


644
00:31:37.514 --> 00:31:40.100
and being like, all right,
we're gonna do it, I was like, "Got it!"


645
00:31:40.184 --> 00:31:43.604
And, like, ran outside...

646
00:31:43.687 --> 00:31:45.189
[audience laughing]

647
00:31:45.272 --> 00:31:46.857
I was like, "We need food!"

648
00:31:48.025 --> 00:31:49.651
"We need food for the car!"

649
00:31:49.735 --> 00:31:53.906
And, like, picked 40 lemons
off of a lemon tree.


650
00:31:53.989 --> 00:31:55.491
[audience laughing]

651
00:31:58.202 --> 00:32:00.871
Like, threw them into
the back of the car.

652
00:32:02.206 --> 00:32:05.417
Ran into the house,
got a squeezy bottle of mayo.


653
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:08.462
[audience laughing]

654
00:32:08.545 --> 00:32:12.800
And, like, a packet of tortillas
from the fridge.


655
00:32:12.883 --> 00:32:15.302
And then, like, I
-I, like,

656
00:32:15.385 --> 00:32:18.972
the other thing is that we made it, like,
a lot scarier for ourselves


657
00:32:19.056 --> 00:32:22.059
'cause we were like,
we decided to leave at dawn.


658
00:32:22.142 --> 00:32:23.852
[audience laughing]

659
00:32:23.936 --> 00:32:24.812
It's like...

660
00:32:25.896 --> 00:32:29.900
Honestly, no need.
Like, leave at 11:00, 11:15, it'll be,


661
00:32:29.983 --> 00:32:31.485
like, less stressful.

662
00:32:31.568 --> 00:32:34.279
But, like, instead we were like,
"My beloved..."


663
00:32:34.363 --> 00:32:36.114
[audience laughing]

664
00:32:36.198 --> 00:32:38.116
"...when the sun peaks..."

665
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.703
Like, it was like, okay,
I guess this is what we decided to do.


666
00:32:41.787 --> 00:32:42.663
And...

667
00:32:43.997 --> 00:32:46.083
it was, I was frightened.

668
00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:47.668
Um, but also,

669
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:52.589
there is a very, very large portion
of my personality


670
00:32:52.673 --> 00:32:54.758
that is a relentless optimist.

671
00:32:54.842 --> 00:32:59.429
And I really also love
spending time with my husband


672
00:32:59.513 --> 00:33:01.807
and I liked that, like,
we would be together nonstop.


673
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.519
- And I'm sure he felt the same way! Um...
- [audience laughing]


674
00:33:05.602 --> 00:33:07.938
But, um, I just,

675
00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:09.648
there... I knew it was serious,

676
00:33:09.731 --> 00:33:11.608
but also, that part of me was like...

677
00:33:11.692 --> 00:33:15.737
[singing] "Road trip,
road trip with my boyfriend. Here I go..."


678
00:33:15.821 --> 00:33:17.531
- He's like...
- [audience laughing]


679
00:33:17.614 --> 00:33:21.159
"No, not road trip with your boyfriend.

680
00:33:21.243 --> 00:33:22.953
Plague, and you need to leave."

681
00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:25.080
[audience laughing]

682
00:33:25.163 --> 00:33:29.001
But still, I was like,
no, but I'm still alive


683
00:33:29.084 --> 00:33:31.587
and, like, I like to costume myself
for the moment.


684
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.880
Like, adornment is worth something

685
00:33:32.963 --> 00:33:34.840
and no one will ever
convince me otherwise.


686
00:33:34.923 --> 00:33:38.093
So, like, I'm gonna pick an outfit
that I can wear for this whole road trip


687
00:33:38.176 --> 00:33:40.679
that, like, represents who I am
and what I'm feeling right now.


688
00:33:40.762 --> 00:33:42.723
Like, who gives a shit? I really do.

689
00:33:42.806 --> 00:33:45.017
And I was like, what should I...

690
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.061
Like, we're not, you know,
we're not, like, taking a lot of stuff.


691
00:33:48.145 --> 00:33:50.689
And, um, I was like, well,

692
00:33:50.772 --> 00:33:53.317
what's something I could wear that, like,

693
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.694
it'll be, like, "I'm down to earth
but I'm cute."


694
00:33:55.777 --> 00:33:57.821
- And...
- [audience laughing]


695
00:33:57.905 --> 00:34:00.032
I was like, oh,

696
00:34:00.115 --> 00:34:02.075
in romcoms,

697
00:34:02.159 --> 00:34:06.371
when the, like, main person
has gone through their, like, bad time,


698
00:34:07.247 --> 00:34:10.292
and then they're like, "Actually,
I will start my cupcake store."


699
00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:11.919
[audience laughing]

700
00:34:12.002 --> 00:34:15.172
They're like, "I'm gonna put my wallpaper
up in my new cupcake store."


701
00:34:15.255 --> 00:34:16.965
And when they're doing that,

702
00:34:17.049 --> 00:34:19.217
they wear overalls.

703
00:34:19.301 --> 00:34:20.928
[audience laughing]

704
00:34:21.011 --> 00:34:22.596
Yeah. They wear overalls.

705
00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.765
Um, and I was
like, oh, that's so cute.

706
00:34:24.848 --> 00:34:26.683
I'll wear overalls. 
It'll be my one thing.

707
00:34:26.767 --> 00:34:29.311
I'll have, like, a couple of tank tops,
I'll change them out.


708
00:34:29.394 --> 00:34:32.147
Um, no bra 'cause I'm horny. And...

709
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.398
[audience laughing]

710
00:34:33.482 --> 00:34:36.193
Um, I was just
like, yeah, great, got it.

711
00:34:36.276 --> 00:34:37.861
The thing was, that, like,

712
00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:39.947
at the start of the pandemic,

713
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.033
there were many of us that were like,
what are we doing here?


714
00:34:43.116 --> 00:34:44.868
Like, do we wear the mask?
Do we wear a glove?


715
00:34:44.952 --> 00:34:46.662
Do we not wear it here?
Like, what do we do?


716
00:34:46.745 --> 00:34:48.205
Where is it? Blah-blah-blah.

717
00:34:48.288 --> 00:34:50.457
And so we were like, well,
we just shouldn't be around other people


718
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.042
as much as possible. Just not.

719
00:34:52.125 --> 00:34:55.128
So, like, if we're gonna have to pee,
we're not gonna go inside,


720
00:34:55.212 --> 00:34:56.797
we're gonna, like,
pee on the side of the road.


721
00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.548
That's, like, you know.

722
00:34:58.632 --> 00:35:02.427
And, like, not to be a snob,
but I love peeing in toilets.


723
00:35:02.511 --> 00:35:05.430
- Um...
- [audience laughing]


724
00:35:05.514 --> 00:35:08.100
It's not a fetish, it's a preference.

725
00:35:08.183 --> 00:35:10.602
I fucking love it, you know. And, um...

726
00:35:10.686 --> 00:35:16.692
And I'm not like that seasoned
at doing it a different way. And...


727
00:35:16.775 --> 00:35:20.028
I don't, you know, I don't know, like,
how many times in your life


728
00:35:20.112 --> 00:35:22.656
you've worn overalls and been outside

729
00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:25.951
and trying to go to the bathroom
on the ground, but...


730
00:35:26.034 --> 00:35:28.078
when you clip them off...

731
00:35:29.246 --> 00:35:32.958
they're not like, "Got ya!"
And, like, go to the front of the room.


732
00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:34.835
[audience laughing]

733
00:35:34.918 --> 00:35:36.586
They lay out behind you.

734
00:35:37.629 --> 00:35:40.048
Like something
waiting to be filled with shame.


735
00:35:40.132 --> 00:35:42.134
[audience laughing]

736
00:35:42.217 --> 00:35:44.720
And so I, on
the side of a road,

737
00:35:44.803 --> 00:35:46.138
because I'm a considerate person

738
00:35:46.221 --> 00:35:48.849
and didn't wanna fucking show my taint
to the entire world,


739
00:35:48.932 --> 00:35:50.475
and I was, like, thinking about that.

740
00:35:50.559 --> 00:35:53.311
I was like, "Uh, how do I,
like, cover this up?


741
00:35:53.395 --> 00:35:55.522
and, like, not let anybody see my, mm."

742
00:35:55.605 --> 00:36:00.444
And I, I sort of, like, forgot the other,
like, elements of the situation


743
00:36:00.527 --> 00:36:03.321
and I,
I just peed right into the overalls.


744
00:36:03.405 --> 00:36:05.198
[audience laughing]

745
00:36:05.282 --> 00:36:06.408
Peed right into the overalls.

746
00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:09.578
And... [sighs]

747
00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:14.041
My lord, I wish that this happened
in, like, Connecticut, more to the east.


748
00:36:14.124 --> 00:36:17.419
Um, in fact, it was in New Mexico.

749
00:36:17.502 --> 00:36:18.962
[audience laughing]

750
00:36:19.046 --> 00:36:21.631
Check your maps. 
Not that far from LA.

751
00:36:22.924 --> 00:36:24.634
How can I put this?

752
00:36:24.718 --> 00:36:25.719
Have you ever...

753
00:36:26.553 --> 00:36:28.472
peed in your pants,

754
00:36:29.556 --> 00:36:31.475
but the pee's, like, on your back?

755
00:36:31.558 --> 00:36:35.062
[audience laughing and applauding]

756
00:36:36.438 --> 00:36:38.774
It was like
it had its hand on my shoulder.


757
00:36:38.857 --> 00:36:40.609
[audience laughing]

758
00:36:40.692 --> 00:36:43.320
Like, for the whole trip,
it was just like...


759
00:36:43.403 --> 00:36:46.406
[audience laughing]

760
00:36:54.581 --> 00:36:57.084
"You're a fucking fool, girl."

761
00:36:57.167 --> 00:37:00.087
Like, whispering in my ear, you know.

762
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:02.005
And then, we were like, okay, we're gonna,

763
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:05.842
we made it to Massachusetts
from Los Angeles in three days.


764
00:37:05.926 --> 00:37:07.761
That's a very impressive pace.

765
00:37:07.844 --> 00:37:10.806
And we would drive, like,

766
00:37:10.889 --> 00:37:13.141
I'd just, like, find a place on the map
and be like, "Go to that place."


767
00:37:13.225 --> 00:37:14.768
And we would, like, get the phone number

768
00:37:14.851 --> 00:37:16.937
and, like, I would,
you know, wanna warn them,


769
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.355
like, we're coming, you know.

770
00:37:18.438 --> 00:37:20.732
Like, I would call
and be really respectful, and be like,


771
00:37:20.816 --> 00:37:22.567
[screaming]

772
00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:25.362
- [audience laughing]
- [loud thud]


773
00:37:25.445 --> 00:37:27.364
[audience laughing]

774
00:37:28.657 --> 00:37:30.659
The phantom of the opera.

775
00:37:30.742 --> 00:37:34.162
[audience cheering and applauding]

776
00:37:37.582 --> 00:37:41.545
[Jenny laughing]

777
00:37:41.628 --> 00:37:43.213
[evil laugh] Um...

778
00:37:43.296 --> 00:37:45.090
[audience laughing]

779
00:37:52.097 --> 00:37:55.350
We get to where we were going.
We had masks, we had gloves.


780
00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:56.601
We had hats?

781
00:37:56.685 --> 00:37:58.770
- [audience laughing]
- Okay.


782
00:37:58.854 --> 00:38:03.358
[inhales] Um, and, um,
we just would go in there,


783
00:38:03.441 --> 00:38:05.610
we would spray everything down.

784
00:38:05.694 --> 00:38:08.613
And then we would roll out sleeping bags

785
00:38:08.697 --> 00:38:10.031
and put them on the beds.

786
00:38:10.115 --> 00:38:11.449
[audience laughing]

787
00:38:11.533 --> 00:38:12.909
And then be like, "Goodnight."

788
00:38:12.993 --> 00:38:16.538
[audience laughing]

789
00:38:18.415 --> 00:38:21.626
Why two different sleeping bags?
I'm unsure, like,


790
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:25.922
we were unmasked in the car, together,

791
00:38:26.006 --> 00:38:29.509
with, like, free pee.

792
00:38:29.593 --> 00:38:31.136
Like, pee around, I don't know.

793
00:38:31.219 --> 00:38:32.679
I was just like, okay,
I guess this is what we're...


794
00:38:32.762 --> 00:38:35.098
Like, I dunno, this is the protocol
we're comfortable with.


795
00:38:35.182 --> 00:38:37.559
And day two...

796
00:38:38.977 --> 00:38:40.812
I got some information via the internet.

797
00:38:40.896 --> 00:38:42.314
I don't know if you guys
have ever done that,


798
00:38:42.397 --> 00:38:44.983
but sometimes it's unreliable and...

799
00:38:45.066 --> 00:38:47.903
I was, like, dismantling really fast.

800
00:38:47.986 --> 00:38:49.654
Um, like really falling apart

801
00:38:49.738 --> 00:38:51.656
and it hit, like, just Olympic rate.

802
00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.035
And, uh, I looked at him,

803
00:38:55.118 --> 00:38:58.788
I look at my phone, I look at him,
I'm like... [panting]


804
00:38:58.872 --> 00:39:00.415
He's like, "What?"

805
00:39:00.498 --> 00:39:02.834
I'm like... [breathes heavily]

806
00:39:02.918 --> 00:39:06.796
[clicks tongue] "They say
it can be in your beard."


807
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.007
- [audience laughing]
- He's like...


808
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.176
"Jenny, what?"

809
00:39:11.259 --> 00:39:14.012
I'm like... [panting]

810
00:39:14.971 --> 00:39:18.850
"It can be in your beard!"

811
00:39:18.934 --> 00:39:20.518
[audience laughing]

812
00:39:20.602 --> 00:39:22.437
"You gotta shave it."

813
00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.190
[audience laughing]

814
00:39:28.318 --> 00:39:30.445
Like, granted,
this is the time when, like,


815
00:39:30.528 --> 00:39:34.908
both my parents were getting, like,
fully nude outside of their front door.


816
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:36.618
Like, wearing gas masks

817
00:39:36.701 --> 00:39:39.704
and my mom, like, spraying down
my dad's physical penis


818
00:39:39.788 --> 00:39:42.123
while he, like, 
Windexed pita chip bags.

819
00:39:42.207 --> 00:39:45.210
Like, nobody knew
what the fuck was going on.


820
00:39:45.293 --> 00:39:47.671
[audience laughing]

821
00:39:50.548 --> 00:39:56.263
But my husband is truly, like,
he is such a darling, sweet person.


822
00:39:56.346 --> 00:39:59.391
And I made him shave his beard.

823
00:39:59.474 --> 00:40:01.309
[audience laughing]

824
00:40:01.393 --> 00:40:03.270
I didn't shave my head.

825
00:40:03.353 --> 00:40:06.147
[audience laughing]

826
00:40:06.231 --> 00:40:07.274
[audience] Whoo!

827
00:40:09.025 --> 00:40:11.653
Didn't even offer
to bleach my mustache in solidarity.


828
00:40:11.736 --> 00:40:13.655
[audience laughing]

829
00:40:13.738 --> 00:40:19.744
We left that motel with surfaces cleaner
than we had arrived.


830
00:40:19.828 --> 00:40:21.329
Beds unslept in.

831
00:40:22.872 --> 00:40:26.126
And a trashcan filled with, like,
tiny little hairs.


832
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.131
Which, by the way, if you didn't know
that a pandemic was beginning,


833
00:40:31.214 --> 00:40:34.217
you'd be like, "Oh, yeah, I saw them.
They were murderers."


834
00:40:34.301 --> 00:40:37.679
[audience laughing]

835
00:40:37.762 --> 00:40:39.973
"They for sure had done a murder."

836
00:40:40.056 --> 00:40:44.644
Um, yeah, they had all the, sort of,
the fixings of being on the lam.


837
00:40:44.728 --> 00:40:45.603
Um...

838
00:40:46.479 --> 00:40:48.898
[clears throat] Yeah. I mean,

839
00:40:48.982 --> 00:40:51.109
the third day we get to Massachusetts

840
00:40:51.192 --> 00:40:54.154
and, like, that was the official day
of the lockdown.


841
00:40:54.237 --> 00:40:58.491
I don't know how your sexualities work,

842
00:40:58.575 --> 00:40:59.909
um...

843
00:40:59.993 --> 00:41:02.454
Would love it
if you wanna email me about it.


844
00:41:02.537 --> 00:41:03.872
[audience laughing]

845
00:41:03.955 --> 00:41:07.000
It's Hanukkah42069...

846
00:41:07.083 --> 00:41:10.003
[audience laughing]

847
00:41:10.086 --> 00:41:12.047
...at jcrew.com.

848
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.591
[audience laughing]

849
00:41:14.674 --> 00:41:18.678
But, um, for me,
we arrived at the doorstep.


850
00:41:18.762 --> 00:41:21.181
I was, like, "I'm covered in piss.

851
00:41:22.057 --> 00:41:23.475
I'm exhausted.

852
00:41:23.558 --> 00:41:25.477
I'm deeply terrified.

853
00:41:26.936 --> 00:41:28.271
I'm dripping wet.

854
00:41:28.355 --> 00:41:29.356
Let's bone."

855
00:41:29.439 --> 00:41:31.983
[audience laughing]

856
00:41:32.067 --> 00:41:33.902
And I got pregnant right away.

857
00:41:33.985 --> 00:41:36.279
[audience laughing]

858
00:41:36.363 --> 00:41:39.032
Then I was like, "Oh, no!"
[nervous giggles]


859
00:41:39.115 --> 00:41:40.492
Like, not, like, 
I was excited,

860
00:41:40.575 --> 00:41:42.577
but I also was, like,
"This is fucking scary.


861
00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.954
Like, I'm pregnant during a plague?"

862
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.707
And then I was like, "Wait."

863
00:41:49.459 --> 00:41:51.378
"Isn't this in the Bible?"

864
00:41:51.461 --> 00:41:54.255
[audience laughing]

865
00:41:55.882 --> 00:42:00.053
Oh, and I don't know, I mean,
I, I don't know, like, the New Testament,


866
00:42:00.136 --> 00:42:03.390
- but...
- [audience laughing]


867
00:42:03.473 --> 00:42:06.559
From the texts that I remember,

868
00:42:06.643 --> 00:42:10.563
there's not, like, a parable about a woman

869
00:42:10.647 --> 00:42:13.900
who travels a continent
covered in her own piss,


870
00:42:13.983 --> 00:42:16.319
while taking in, like,

871
00:42:16.403 --> 00:42:17.987
and retaining no information, but...

872
00:42:18.071 --> 00:42:19.614
[audience laughing]

873
00:42:19.697 --> 00:42:21.699
Maybe it's in one of the P-salms.

874
00:42:21.783 --> 00:42:24.744
[audience laughing]

875
00:42:24.828 --> 00:42:27.914
[Jenny laughing]

876
00:42:27.997 --> 00:42:30.500
Why, why do they
call it that? Come on.

877
00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:33.795
P-salms. [inhales] Um...

878
00:42:33.878 --> 00:42:38.716
Um, anyway, speaking of religious texts,

879
00:42:39.884 --> 00:42:43.638
um, I don't know if you're, like, familiar
with my body of work,


880
00:42:43.721 --> 00:42:48.852
but, um, at the
end of my last special,

881
00:42:48.935 --> 00:42:52.188
um, I, uh, I said something

882
00:42:52.272 --> 00:42:56.860
which now, to me, just feels like, like,
cave writing on a wall, or something.


883
00:42:56.943 --> 00:42:57.944
I'm like, "Who did that?"

884
00:42:58.027 --> 00:42:59.362
But, um, you know,

885
00:42:59.446 --> 00:43:02.115
reviewing the footage, 
I seem to have said

886
00:43:02.198 --> 00:43:05.076
that, uh, I was
not going to date anymore

887
00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.287
and that I was going to

888
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:11.875
"turn my pussy into a museum
with a major alarm system."


889
00:43:11.958 --> 00:43:13.585
[audience laughing]

890
00:43:13.668 --> 00:43:15.962
She said that. Well, 
I guess I did.

891
00:43:16.045 --> 00:43:20.633
Um, and that I could only masturbate
to the full moon, um...


892
00:43:21.718 --> 00:43:24.220
because patriarchy
had ruined all men for me.


893
00:43:24.304 --> 00:43:25.638
And, um,

894
00:43:25.722 --> 00:43:30.268
you know, I really admire the specificity
of that plan, but...


895
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:32.061
[audience laughing]

896
00:43:32.145 --> 00:43:35.148
Like, it turned out to be just, like,
super impractical, I guess.


897
00:43:35.231 --> 00:43:39.152
And just, yeah, it was, like,
it was, like, hard to get done.


898
00:43:39.235 --> 00:43:40.403
And, like, there's not, like,

899
00:43:40.487 --> 00:43:42.572
there's not, like,
a full moon every night and...


900
00:43:42.655 --> 00:43:44.324
[audience laughing]

901
00:43:45.366 --> 00:43:48.953
I like, like, committed relationships.
Um, need it to be there.


902
00:43:49.037 --> 00:43:53.583
Um, and so what happened then
was that I just kind of was like,


903
00:43:53.666 --> 00:43:55.960
I'm like, I didn't wanna,
like, go on an app,


904
00:43:56.044 --> 00:43:59.214
I don't want, like,
a computer to help me find someone.


905
00:43:59.297 --> 00:44:00.715
I just, like, wanna find them on Earth.

906
00:44:00.798 --> 00:44:02.592
And so I was like,

907
00:44:02.675 --> 00:44:04.802
I don't know... [sighs]

908
00:44:04.886 --> 00:44:06.471
...sleeping with a lot of friends.

909
00:44:06.554 --> 00:44:09.265
I really miss those friendships,
wish I hadn't done that.


910
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:11.392
[audience laughing]

911
00:44:11.476 --> 00:44:12.977
Oopsies.

912
00:44:13.061 --> 00:44:14.604
[audience laughing]

913
00:44:14.687 --> 00:44:16.147
[inhales] Sorry.

914
00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:18.733
[audience and Jenny laughing]

915
00:44:18.816 --> 00:44:21.361
Come to think of it,
I shouldn't have done that. Um...


916
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:25.490
And then, um,
after I was like, "Well, who's left?"


917
00:44:25.573 --> 00:44:28.243
- Um...
- [audience laughing]


918
00:44:28.326 --> 00:44:31.412
I was just kind
of, like, on the sidewalk,

919
00:44:31.496 --> 00:44:33.957
like, hoping to make eye contact.
Like, just being like...


920
00:44:35.375 --> 00:44:39.712
"You looked into it, it's your wife now.
It's your wife now. You found me." Um...


921
00:44:39.796 --> 00:44:44.676
And then, finally, 
I met my husband.

922
00:44:44.759 --> 00:44:47.595
Um, and it was really wonderful and...

923
00:44:47.679 --> 00:44:49.764
- [audience] Whoo!
- Yeah.


924
00:44:49.847 --> 00:44:50.807
Totally.

925
00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.183
[audience cheering and applauding]

926
00:44:52.267 --> 00:44:54.060
Yeah. Yeah.

927
00:44:54.143 --> 00:44:57.272
But, um, when I
fell in love with him,

928
00:44:57.355 --> 00:45:00.149
he lived in Amsterdam.

929
00:45:00.233 --> 00:45:04.112
Um, and, like, he was here,
but then he had to go back.


930
00:45:04.195 --> 00:45:07.240
And, like, obviously, after one second,
I was deeply in love with him,


931
00:45:07.323 --> 00:45:10.827
but afraid to tell him
because I wanted to be chill. Um...


932
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:12.787
Which, by the way, is a fool's errand.

933
00:45:13.997 --> 00:45:17.083
And I'll just add
that chillness is not real.


934
00:45:17.166 --> 00:45:21.546
Uh, I don't believe
that chill people exist.


935
00:45:21.629 --> 00:45:25.592
I think it is a concept
that misogynists invented


936
00:45:25.675 --> 00:45:28.595
so that we could act
like we don't have needs.


937
00:45:28.678 --> 00:45:32.265
[audience cheering and applauding]

938
00:45:34.809 --> 00:45:37.103
Um, so I fell in love with him.

939
00:45:37.186 --> 00:45:39.897
He had to go back to Amsterdam.

940
00:45:39.981 --> 00:45:44.068
And, um, that, obviously,
deeply broke my heart.


941
00:45:44.152 --> 00:45:47.739
Um, and I wasn't gonna be like,
"So, where are we at?" You know, um...


942
00:45:50.992 --> 00:45:55.538
I wanted to be like, "I'm totally cool
if you have other lovers." Um...


943
00:45:55.622 --> 00:45:57.457
[audience laughing]

944
00:45:59.959 --> 00:46:01.586
Ugh, that was not how I felt.

945
00:46:01.669 --> 00:46:04.088
Um, and then, much to my delight,

946
00:46:04.172 --> 00:46:07.634
he was like,
"I don't wanna be apart from you."


947
00:46:10.345 --> 00:46:14.599
And he was like, "Would you like
to come to Amsterdam with me,


948
00:46:14.682 --> 00:46:15.767
um, for Christmas?"

949
00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:18.186
And, of course, I was like,
"Tickets, tickets right now!"


950
00:46:18.269 --> 00:46:20.938
Um, but I was like, "Oh,
let me check my iCal,


951
00:46:21.022 --> 00:46:24.525
as if I've ever once used that.
Um... [clears throat]


952
00:46:24.609 --> 00:46:27.487
Whenever anyone tells me
to be somewhere, I'm like, "Got it!"


953
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.074
[audience laughing]

954
00:46:31.157 --> 00:46:33.076
So he's like, "Come to Amsterdam."

955
00:46:33.159 --> 00:46:36.120
And I, you know, right now, I mean,

956
00:46:36.204 --> 00:46:40.833
I'm, like, a casual Satanist,
but, um, I was raised Jewish.


957
00:46:40.917 --> 00:46:46.214
And that means, for me,
that during the Christmas holidays,


958
00:46:46.297 --> 00:46:50.760
um, I can fly anywhere in the world
to suck anyone's dick.


959
00:46:50.843 --> 00:46:52.887
[audience laughing and applauding]

960
00:46:57.016 --> 00:46:58.893
'Cause I don't have a family obligation.

961
00:46:59.936 --> 00:47:01.771
He's like,
"What are you doing for Christmas?"


962
00:47:01.854 --> 00:47:04.273
I'm like, "Riding you, I suspect."

963
00:47:04.357 --> 00:47:07.402
[audience laughing]

964
00:47:07.485 --> 00:47:10.113
"Oinky, oinky, 
Father Christmas."

965
00:47:10.196 --> 00:47:12.323
He's like, "What?" I'm like, "Nothing."

966
00:47:12.407 --> 00:47:13.783
Um...

967
00:47:15.535 --> 00:47:18.996
So I took an airplane to Amsterdam.

968
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.458
He came to the airport with flowers,

969
00:47:22.542 --> 00:47:25.086
which, obviously, made me
have an orgasm right away.


970
00:47:25.169 --> 00:47:26.170
[audience laughing]

971
00:47:26.254 --> 00:47:28.297
And I was like, "I'm coming."
Like that, like...


972
00:47:29.424 --> 00:47:31.259
Which is, by the way,
how you have to come

973
00:47:31.342 --> 00:47:33.386
if you have a sleeping two-year-old
in your house.


974
00:47:33.469 --> 00:47:36.013
You have to, like, claw your way up
to your partner's ear and be like,


975
00:47:36.097 --> 00:47:37.140
"I'm coming right now."

976
00:47:37.223 --> 00:47:39.600
[audience laughing and applauding]

977
00:47:44.439 --> 00:47:45.732
[clears throat] Um,

978
00:47:45.815 --> 00:47:47.900
and he was like,

979
00:47:48.901 --> 00:47:51.904
um, he was like, "I've got
such a nice trip for us planned.


980
00:47:51.988 --> 00:47:53.448
Like, we're gonna go
to the Rembrandt Museum.


981
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:54.782
We're gonna get a little Christmas tree.

982
00:47:54.866 --> 00:47:56.325
And, like, we're gonna go to the circus."

983
00:47:56.409 --> 00:48:00.288
And I was like, "Don't ask me
if I need to go to the Anne Frank House."


984
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:01.873
[audience laughing]

985
00:48:01.956 --> 00:48:05.126
I do not need an epigenetic meltdown

986
00:48:05.209 --> 00:48:06.502
on my sex vacation.

987
00:48:06.586 --> 00:48:08.254
[audience laughing]

988
00:48:08.337 --> 00:48:10.173
I know it's there, 
I know what happened.

989
00:48:10.256 --> 00:48:13.384
I can feel it in my spirit.
I don't wanna talk about it right now.


990
00:48:13.468 --> 00:48:16.554
[audience laughing]

991
00:48:16.637 --> 00:48:19.348
And he's like, ba-da-da,
we'll do this and that


992
00:48:19.432 --> 00:48:22.351
and then we'll get on the bikes.
And I was like...


993
00:48:22.435 --> 00:48:24.228
[gasps] "Wh... I'm sorry?"

994
00:48:24.312 --> 00:48:25.646
[audience laughing]

995
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.733
"So sorry, I feel like I heard,
like, a, like a weird word."


996
00:48:28.816 --> 00:48:30.735
[audience laughing softly]

997
00:48:30.818 --> 00:48:33.362
He's like, "We'll get on the bikes."
And I was like...


998
00:48:37.116 --> 00:48:39.035
"Oh, there's the other fucking shoe."

999
00:48:39.118 --> 00:48:41.996
[audience laughing]

1000
00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:46.083
I'm looking at this guy, I'm like,
"I thought you were fucking perfect."


1001
00:48:46.167 --> 00:48:47.335
[audience laughing]

1002
00:48:47.418 --> 00:48:50.129
"And now you just said
the most fucked up thing


1003
00:48:50.213 --> 00:48:52.089
that anyone has ever said to me!"

1004
00:48:52.173 --> 00:48:55.051
[audience laughing]

1005
00:48:55.134 --> 00:48:56.969
"Get on the bikes?

1006
00:48:57.053 --> 00:48:58.763
How dare you!"

1007
00:48:58.846 --> 00:49:03.100
Like, the idea that
you would just be so,

1008
00:49:03.184 --> 00:49:06.729
you would just assume that someone
would do sports with you


1009
00:49:06.813 --> 00:49:08.356
in another country...

1010
00:49:08.439 --> 00:49:10.650
[audience laughing]

1011
00:49:10.733 --> 00:49:12.235
Like, I was fucking freaked out.

1012
00:49:12.318 --> 00:49:14.779
Like, I was like, "I should get
on another plane and go home."


1013
00:49:14.862 --> 00:49:17.615
Like, this is so...
And I was just, like, standing there,


1014
00:49:17.698 --> 00:49:19.909
like, like, I'm not an adrenaline junkie,

1015
00:49:19.992 --> 00:49:22.578
you know, I don't wanna
fucking ride a bike. But like...


1016
00:49:22.662 --> 00:49:25.122
[audience laughing]

1017
00:49:26.332 --> 00:49:28.084
I was just like...

1018
00:49:28.167 --> 00:49:30.711
I want to be brave for love.

1019
00:49:32.129 --> 00:49:34.549
Like, I really want
to be brave for love.

1020
00:49:34.632 --> 00:49:35.633
That's what I'm like.

1021
00:49:35.716 --> 00:49:38.135
More than I'm a person
who's afraid to ride a bike,


1022
00:49:38.219 --> 00:49:39.512
I want to be brave for love.

1023
00:49:39.595 --> 00:49:42.974
Like, I wanna go to bed at night
and be like, "I was brave for love."


1024
00:49:43.057 --> 00:49:45.518
And, like, go off into dreamland,
you know.


1025
00:49:45.601 --> 00:49:46.936
[audience laughing]

1026
00:49:47.019 --> 00:49:51.941
But have you ever been faced with, like,
a gorgeous situation


1027
00:49:52.024 --> 00:49:54.360
that you have wished for?

1028
00:49:54.443 --> 00:49:58.364
Like, that a really good person
really loves you


1029
00:49:58.447 --> 00:50:00.867
and is being super fucking nice to you.

1030
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:02.618
And they're not doing anything wrong.

1031
00:50:02.702 --> 00:50:04.495
And it's exactly what you asked for.

1032
00:50:04.579 --> 00:50:08.916
And your reaction, um,
is to be filled with fear fantasies


1033
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.251
and suspicion

1034
00:50:10.334 --> 00:50:12.628
and, um, be unable to trust.

1035
00:50:12.712 --> 00:50:16.257
And you're like, "Oh, that's a mismatched
sort of kind of thingy there."


1036
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.218
And you're like, "It feels really bad
to feel this way.


1037
00:50:19.302 --> 00:50:22.346
And also, it's, like,
a really bad fucking look."


1038
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:23.973
But you can't stop yourself.

1039
00:50:24.056 --> 00:50:26.976
You're just like, "Oh, no, but if
I trust them, then I'll let my guard down


1040
00:50:27.059 --> 00:50:28.060
and then they'll hurt me," you know,

1041
00:50:28.144 --> 00:50:30.187
and it's just, like,
a terrible, terrible cycle.


1042
00:50:30.271 --> 00:50:33.316
But then, of course,
the person's goodness shines onto you


1043
00:50:33.399 --> 00:50:35.776
and shows you the inside of yourself
where you're like,


1044
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.029
"Oh, I'm believing
some bad things about myself,


1045
00:50:38.112 --> 00:50:39.071
but I'm not bad.

1046
00:50:39.155 --> 00:50:41.991
I'm just holding some brutal beliefs
that I should get rid of."


1047
00:50:42.074 --> 00:50:44.535
For example, that, like,
my feelings are too much


1048
00:50:44.619 --> 00:50:45.953
and they happen too immediately.

1049
00:50:46.037 --> 00:50:47.413
And nobody wants to deal with them.

1050
00:50:47.496 --> 00:50:50.708
And nobody will ever be able to give me
the amount of love that I need


1051
00:50:50.791 --> 00:50:52.418
in order to actually feel loved.

1052
00:50:52.501 --> 00:50:53.794
Because most people receive love

1053
00:50:53.878 --> 00:50:55.671
and they hold it in their hearts
like a bowl.


1054
00:50:55.755 --> 00:50:57.506
But for me, I'm more like a colander,

1055
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.842
or a strange felt hat,
that just leaks away.


1056
00:50:59.926 --> 00:51:02.511
And then you're like,
"No, no, stop it. Stop it. Stop it.


1057
00:51:02.595 --> 00:51:04.388
You're doing it. You're doing it.
You don't have to do this.


1058
00:51:04.472 --> 00:51:06.515
You can do something else.
Think of something else.


1059
00:51:06.599 --> 00:51:07.475
Think of something else.

1060
00:51:07.558 --> 00:51:09.894
You're like, I can't just, like,
grab their face and scream,


1061
00:51:09.977 --> 00:51:11.228
"Don't destroy me!

1062
00:51:11.312 --> 00:51:12.605
Don't destroy me!

1063
00:51:12.688 --> 00:51:13.814
Don't destroy me!"

1064
00:51:13.898 --> 00:51:17.151
So, instead, you find yourself
standing in Amsterdam...


1065
00:51:17.234 --> 00:51:19.695
[audience laughing and applauding]

1066
00:51:19.779 --> 00:51:23.199
- And...
- [audience cheering]


1067
00:51:27.161 --> 00:51:28.621
And you're not even on drugs.

1068
00:51:28.704 --> 00:51:30.122
[audience laughing]

1069
00:51:30.206 --> 00:51:32.416
And you're like, "Oh, my God.

1070
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.670
I'm about to do
the most fucking psychedelic shit


1071
00:51:35.753 --> 00:51:37.797
I've ever done right now."

1072
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.966
And so, anyway,

1073
00:51:40.049 --> 00:51:43.803
not to be like a jock
who turned this into a sports report...


1074
00:51:43.886 --> 00:51:45.805
[audience laughing softly]

1075
00:51:45.888 --> 00:51:48.474
...but guess who rode a fucking bike?

1076
00:51:48.557 --> 00:51:51.686
[audience cheering and applauding]

1077
00:51:58.651 --> 00:52:00.069
Ring-ring! I did it.

1078
00:52:01.612 --> 00:52:03.030
I did it.

1079
00:52:03.114 --> 00:52:03.990
Um...

1080
00:52:05.449 --> 00:52:08.744
I would not be
able to be here tonight

1081
00:52:08.828 --> 00:52:11.455
telling this, like,
weird love story in reverse,


1082
00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:14.458
uh, wearing this little tuxedo
in this fancy theater,


1083
00:52:14.542 --> 00:52:17.169
um, if it were not for the fact

1084
00:52:17.253 --> 00:52:22.258
that I am dedicated
to going to see my therapist.


1085
00:52:22.341 --> 00:52:25.219
[audience cheering]

1086
00:52:25.302 --> 00:52:27.763
Yeah, I love my therapist.

1087
00:52:27.847 --> 00:52:32.685
And I know you're not allowed to say that,
but, um, I love her.


1088
00:52:32.768 --> 00:52:34.562
I love her. I love her.

1089
00:52:34.645 --> 00:52:35.771
Um, I love her.

1090
00:52:35.855 --> 00:52:38.274
And I actually find that, at this point,

1091
00:52:38.357 --> 00:52:40.568
to be the hardest part of therapy.

1092
00:52:41.402 --> 00:52:42.987
That, like, when the session is over,

1093
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:45.614
you're not allowed to be like,
"Okay, bye-bye, I love you."


1094
00:52:45.698 --> 00:52:47.658
[audience laughing]

1095
00:52:47.742 --> 00:52:49.952
But something happened
between us that really,


1096
00:52:50.036 --> 00:52:51.328
I feel like, um,

1097
00:52:51.412 --> 00:52:54.331
made a difficult impression
on our relationship.


1098
00:52:54.415 --> 00:52:59.879
And that is that, recently,
she texted me by mistake.


1099
00:52:59.962 --> 00:53:02.298
[audience] Ooh!

1100
00:53:02.381 --> 00:53:03.424
I know.

1101
00:53:05.134 --> 00:53:07.678
By recently, I mean it happened
three years ago and...


1102
00:53:07.762 --> 00:53:09.388
[audience laughing]

1103
00:53:09.472 --> 00:53:11.348
I can't fucking stop thinking about it.

1104
00:53:11.432 --> 00:53:14.018
Um, just can't stop thinking about it.

1105
00:53:14.101 --> 00:53:18.397
And, um, it was, like, on the weekend
and I saw her name pop up.


1106
00:53:18.481 --> 00:53:20.441
And it's like, have you ever
gotten a text from someone


1107
00:53:20.524 --> 00:53:23.152
who's, like, kind of out of your league?

1108
00:53:23.235 --> 00:53:27.114
And you're just like, "Oh, like, I am not
gonna open this right now, 'cause, like,


1109
00:53:27.198 --> 00:53:29.867
whatever it is,
it's gonna fucking rock my world."


1110
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:31.702
[audience laughing]

1111
00:53:31.786 --> 00:53:34.872
"Like, I'm gonna wait until I'm, like,
you know, in the bathroom."


1112
00:53:34.955 --> 00:53:36.082
Um...

1113
00:53:36.165 --> 00:53:38.584
And so, I didn't know,

1114
00:53:38.667 --> 00:53:39.877
I was, like, "The weekend?

1115
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.295
Like, from Pamela?
Like, what could it be?"


1116
00:53:41.378 --> 00:53:44.090
And I just, I don't know, like, I thought,
like, I don't know, maybe it's, like,


1117
00:53:44.173 --> 00:53:47.051
"Hey, Jennie, I'm at a botanical garden
and I saw a flower


1118
00:53:47.134 --> 00:53:48.886
that seemed like it had,
like, a really good shape,


1119
00:53:48.969 --> 00:53:51.388
but also an interesting mental thing,
and I thought of you anyway, hon."


1120
00:53:51.472 --> 00:53:53.307
You know, like, I don't know,
something normal.


1121
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:54.308
And...

1122
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:55.976
[audience laughing]

1123
00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.895
Um, I opened it up

1124
00:53:57.978 --> 00:54:00.189
and it was, like,

1125
00:54:00.272 --> 00:54:05.111
so-and-so and I had a lovely time at,
name of a fancy restaurant,


1126
00:54:05.194 --> 00:54:07.613
for his Father's Day meal.

1127
00:54:07.696 --> 00:54:08.739
And I was like...

1128
00:54:10.116 --> 00:54:13.577
- [gasps]
- [audience laughing]


1129
00:54:13.661 --> 00:54:18.749
Uh, like... Like, honestly, like,
what the fuck, Pamela?


1130
00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:21.085
- Like...
- [audience laughing]


1131
00:54:21.168 --> 00:54:24.880
Like, I was, that was so hurtful.
Like, I-I...


1132
00:54:24.964 --> 00:54:27.091
[audience laughing]

1133
00:54:27.174 --> 00:54:29.051
I mean, where do I even start? Um...

1134
00:54:29.135 --> 00:54:30.511
[audience laughing softly]

1135
00:54:30.594 --> 00:54:33.430
Mm, Pamela goes to restaurants?

1136
00:54:33.514 --> 00:54:35.474
[audience laughing]

1137
00:54:35.558 --> 00:54:36.892
Okay.

1138
00:54:36.976 --> 00:54:38.561
[deep inhale]

1139
00:54:38.644 --> 00:54:41.147
She led me to believe...

1140
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:43.023
[audience laughing softly]

1141
00:54:43.107 --> 00:54:47.611
...that she just stays in that one room
and waits for me to say stuff.


1142
00:54:47.695 --> 00:54:49.822
[audience laughing]

1143
00:54:49.905 --> 00:54:53.033
[sighs] And then, like, I guess,
the other thing that was sort of hard


1144
00:54:53.117 --> 00:54:55.828
was that I was like, so Pamela

1145
00:54:55.911 --> 00:54:58.289
went with her husband

1146
00:54:58.372 --> 00:55:01.208
to a restaurant for a Father's Day meal.

1147
00:55:01.292 --> 00:55:04.003
But I know that my father, Ron,

1148
00:55:04.086 --> 00:55:06.839
did not go to a restaurant
on Father's Day,


1149
00:55:06.922 --> 00:55:09.216
so, I guess, like,
the excruciating math on that is, like,


1150
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.968
Pamela is not my mom.

1151
00:55:11.051 --> 00:55:14.221
[audience laughing]

1152
00:55:14.305 --> 00:55:15.389
And just, what a gut punch.

1153
00:55:15.472 --> 00:55:17.766
Like, I was like, okay,
you didn't have to say it to my face,


1154
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:18.934
like you're not my mom.

1155
00:55:19.018 --> 00:55:20.227
Like, okay, I get it, like...

1156
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:21.187
'Cause, I, I know.

1157
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:23.105
Like, I have this "other mom" named Nancy,

1158
00:55:23.189 --> 00:55:24.481
who's, like, always been there.

1159
00:55:24.565 --> 00:55:26.734
- And...
- [audience laughing]


1160
00:55:26.817 --> 00:55:29.695
I, like, texted her back.

1161
00:55:29.778 --> 00:55:30.863
And I was like,

1162
00:55:31.739 --> 00:55:37.036
"I think that you meant
to send this to someone else."


1163
00:55:38.287 --> 00:55:40.998
And she wrote back...

1164
00:55:42.082 --> 00:55:43.083
"Indeed."

1165
00:55:43.167 --> 00:55:46.378
[audience laughing]

1166
00:55:50.466 --> 00:55:53.677
And, um, and so then, obviously,
I, like, never brought it up again.


1167
00:55:53.761 --> 00:55:57.556
And then, years later,
we were talking, um,


1168
00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.725
about parenthood and she was like,

1169
00:55:59.808 --> 00:56:02.144
"You know, um, when I had my daughter..."

1170
00:56:02.228 --> 00:56:03.812
And I was like... [grunts]

1171
00:56:03.896 --> 00:56:05.648
[audience laughing]

1172
00:56:05.731 --> 00:56:06.607
[gasps]

1173
00:56:08.234 --> 00:56:09.360
[gasps]

1174
00:56:10.653 --> 00:56:11.570
[loud gasp]

1175
00:56:11.654 --> 00:56:14.073
[audience laughing]

1176
00:56:17.576 --> 00:56:20.329
Have you ever seen
the exact center of your pain?


1177
00:56:20.412 --> 00:56:22.164
[audience laughing]

1178
00:56:24.208 --> 00:56:27.211
You know, like, a lot of us are, like,
concerned with the chaos around the pain,


1179
00:56:27.294 --> 00:56:29.380
but, like, really,
there's a center of the pain.


1180
00:56:29.463 --> 00:56:30.839
And if you can see it,

1181
00:56:30.923 --> 00:56:33.050
you can change yourself
and accept yourself.


1182
00:56:33.133 --> 00:56:36.387
And Pamela showed me
the center of my pain.


1183
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.306
And I was like, "Oh, my God.
I see the center of my pain


1184
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:41.058
and it's that Pamela is not my mother."

1185
00:56:41.141 --> 00:56:43.227
[audience laughing]

1186
00:56:44.144 --> 00:56:48.524
And the other thing that she taught me
to accept about myself,


1187
00:56:48.607 --> 00:56:52.111
um, is that I am, um,

1188
00:56:52.194 --> 00:56:55.906
somebody that can proudly say that I would

1189
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:57.658
stalk Pamela and her daughter.

1190
00:56:57.741 --> 00:57:01.412
[audience laughing]

1191
00:57:01.495 --> 00:57:02.746
And I'm just like,

1192
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.457
whatever, like, dangerously close to 40.

1193
00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:07.876
Um, meaning, I'm 41, so...

1194
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.586
[audience laughing]

1195
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.588
Forty itself is like, "Get away."

1196
00:57:12.548 --> 00:57:15.634
Um, and I'm just like, I don't,
I'm not here for nonsense anymore.


1197
00:57:15.718 --> 00:57:17.761
Like, I am what I am.
I'm gonna keep growing,


1198
00:57:17.845 --> 00:57:20.014
but I'm, like,
I'm not shunning myself anymore.


1199
00:57:20.097 --> 00:57:23.392
The parts of myself
that are, like, dangerous and dark,


1200
00:57:23.475 --> 00:57:27.187
I'm going to dwell in that shadow
and warm it up.


1201
00:57:27.271 --> 00:57:32.651
And what that means for me is that
in the drippy, velvety part of the night,


1202
00:57:32.735 --> 00:57:36.113
when all of the freaks
are jerking off to the real stuff


1203
00:57:36.196 --> 00:57:38.282
that they really jerk off to...

1204
00:57:38.365 --> 00:57:39.908
[audience laughing]

1205
00:57:39.992 --> 00:57:42.578
The people who are like,
"This is what I really need."


1206
00:57:42.661 --> 00:57:44.330
[audience laughing]

1207
00:57:44.413 --> 00:57:46.582
"This is what gets me to go."

1208
00:57:46.665 --> 00:57:48.334
[audience laughing]

1209
00:57:48.417 --> 00:57:50.794
When the demons are out,

1210
00:57:50.878 --> 00:57:53.005
I just sit up in my bed,

1211
00:57:53.088 --> 00:57:55.549
and I let myself have my food,

1212
00:57:55.632 --> 00:58:00.304
and what I need is that I think
about Pamela and her daughter.


1213
00:58:00.387 --> 00:58:01.680
[audience laughing softly]

1214
00:58:01.764 --> 00:58:03.015
And I'm like, "Do it.

1215
00:58:03.098 --> 00:58:03.974
[softly] Do it.

1216
00:58:04.058 --> 00:58:05.684
Think about it. Do it.

1217
00:58:05.768 --> 00:58:06.727
Give it to yourself.

1218
00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:07.686
Think about it.

1219
00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:08.645
Think about it.

1220
00:58:08.729 --> 00:58:09.605
Think about it."

1221
00:58:09.688 --> 00:58:11.523
And I think about Pamela and her daughter.

1222
00:58:11.607 --> 00:58:13.275
And they're getting into a car,

1223
00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:16.487
and they're putting on their seatbelts
'cause they love themselves so much.


1224
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.698
And they don't want anyone to get hurt
'cause we're best, best friends.


1225
00:58:19.782 --> 00:58:23.160
[audience laughing]

1226
00:58:23.243 --> 00:58:25.788
And they drive the car
because they're going out to lunch


1227
00:58:25.871 --> 00:58:26.955
in the middle of the day.

1228
00:58:27.039 --> 00:58:29.333
Because they love
to have fun with each other!


1229
00:58:29.416 --> 00:58:30.959
[audience laughing]

1230
00:58:31.043 --> 00:58:33.545
And they're like,
"Let's pick a restaurant by the sea.


1231
00:58:33.629 --> 00:58:36.965
Because we're not allergic to oysters,
like some idiots are."


1232
00:58:37.049 --> 00:58:39.218
[audience laughing]

1233
00:58:41.011 --> 00:58:43.889
And they're like, they're like,
"I can't wait to talk to you over lunch


1234
00:58:43.972 --> 00:58:45.641
about a variety of subjects.

1235
00:58:45.724 --> 00:58:47.184
Not just one conversation

1236
00:58:47.267 --> 00:58:50.979
where we talk about who has cancer,
except I never get to talk."


1237
00:58:51.063 --> 00:58:53.232
[audience laughing]

1238
00:58:59.029 --> 00:59:01.490
And then they go to their restaurant

1239
00:59:01.573 --> 00:59:03.659
and I have followed them in an Uber.

1240
00:59:03.742 --> 00:59:05.911
[audience laughing]

1241
00:59:08.455 --> 00:59:11.875
And I get to the restaurant.
I go right into the bathroom.


1242
00:59:11.959 --> 00:59:13.377
And they sit down at their table,

1243
00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.587
but after a while
Pamela's daughter goes into the bathroom.


1244
00:59:15.671 --> 00:59:18.257
And she uses the bathroom
and she comes out to the sink.


1245
00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.591
And I'm already there.

1246
00:59:19.675 --> 00:59:20.926
[audience laughing]

1247
00:59:21.009 --> 00:59:23.804
And I'm using the soap
and I'm frickin' sudsing up.


1248
00:59:23.887 --> 00:59:26.098
I've been sudsing for, like, 15 minutes.

1249
00:59:26.181 --> 00:59:30.018
I have so much fucking soap on my hands,
it's like cotton candy. I'm just like...


1250
00:59:30.853 --> 00:59:32.980
I'm the clean girl.
I'm the cleanest girl you have.


1251
00:59:33.063 --> 00:59:35.149
I'm a nice, clean girl.
I'm the cleanest girl that there is.


1252
00:59:35.232 --> 00:59:38.193
I'm a clean, clean girl. I'm a good girl.
Clean girl. Clean, clean. I'm clean.


1253
00:59:38.277 --> 00:59:39.611
I'm so clean, I'm the cleanest girl.

1254
00:59:39.695 --> 00:59:41.989
Nobody else is as clean as me.
Clean, clean, clean.


1255
00:59:42.072 --> 00:59:43.949
[audience laughing]

1256
00:59:44.032 --> 00:59:47.077
She's, like, washing her hands,
being like... [giggles]


1257
00:59:47.161 --> 00:59:48.328
"That's a lot of soap."

1258
00:59:48.412 --> 00:59:50.956
[audience laughing]

1259
00:59:51.039 --> 00:59:51.957
I'm like...

1260
00:59:53.167 --> 00:59:55.752
[audience laughing]

1261
00:59:55.836 --> 00:59:56.712
"What?"

1262
00:59:56.795 --> 00:59:58.172
[audience laughing]

1263
00:59:58.255 --> 00:59:59.715
She's like, "Oh, nothing.

1264
00:59:59.798 --> 01:00:02.509
It's just, like, that's, that's a lot,
sorry, that's a lot of soap."


1265
01:00:02.593 --> 01:00:04.386
I'm like, "Are you sorry?"

1266
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:07.014
[audience laughing]

1267
01:00:07.097 --> 01:00:09.349
She's like, "Oh, okay."

1268
01:00:09.433 --> 01:00:11.393
And I'm like, "Yeah, it is okay."

1269
01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:13.061
[audience laughing]

1270
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.440
[audience laughing louder]

1271
01:00:19.193 --> 01:00:20.819
"Are you here with your mother?"

1272
01:00:20.903 --> 01:00:22.571
[audience laughing]

1273
01:00:22.654 --> 01:00:23.780
She's like, "What?"

1274
01:00:24.907 --> 01:00:29.786
I'm like, "Are you here with your mother?"

1275
01:00:30.746 --> 01:00:33.415
She's like, "Uh, uh, yeah."

1276
01:00:33.499 --> 01:00:35.584
I'm like, "What's so fucking funny, hon?"

1277
01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:37.252
[crazy laugh]

1278
01:00:37.336 --> 01:00:39.046
"What's the hullabaloo?"

1279
01:00:39.129 --> 01:00:42.841
[audience laughing]

1280
01:00:45.344 --> 01:00:49.890
She's like, "Yeah, I'm here
with my mother. It's fine."


1281
01:00:50.891 --> 01:00:53.477
And then I, like,
get so close to her.

1282
01:00:55.145 --> 01:00:58.565
I smush my cheek into her face.

1283
01:00:59.566 --> 01:01:01.902
I stare at her in the mirror.

1284
01:01:01.985 --> 01:01:04.821
And she can't move from her spot.

1285
01:01:04.905 --> 01:01:09.618
Because she doesn't have
as strong of a character as I have.


1286
01:01:09.701 --> 01:01:12.371
[audience laughing]

1287
01:01:13.455 --> 01:01:15.958
And I'm like... [panting]

1288
01:01:16.041 --> 01:01:17.918
"I hope you know...

1289
01:01:19.294 --> 01:01:21.505
[shaky inhale] ...what you fucking have."

1290
01:01:21.588 --> 01:01:24.716
[audience laughing]

1291
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.302
[inhales] And she's like... [panting]

1292
01:01:27.386 --> 01:01:29.137
- "What?"
- [audience laughing]


1293
01:01:29.221 --> 01:01:34.017
And I'm like, "I hope you know

1294
01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:36.770
what you fucking

1295
01:01:36.853 --> 01:01:38.438
have!"

1296
01:01:38.522 --> 01:01:40.399
And she's like... [shouts]

1297
01:01:40.482 --> 01:01:46.280
And I'm like, "This is what it's like
to love Pamela!"


1298
01:01:46.363 --> 01:01:49.741
[audience laughing and applauding]

1299
01:01:49.825 --> 01:01:53.036
[audience cheering and applauding]

1300
01:02:02.671 --> 01:02:04.881
Thank you so much.

1301
01:02:06.925 --> 01:02:07.884
Be well.

1302
01:02:09.511 --> 01:02:12.180
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1303
01:02:12.264 --> 01:02:13.390
Good night!

1304
01:02:13.473 --> 01:02:15.183
Take care of yourselves.

1305
01:02:15.267 --> 01:02:16.643
I love you!

1306
01:02:16.727 --> 01:02:20.480
