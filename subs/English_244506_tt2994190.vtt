1
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.980
Get in there!

2
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.190
Spyglass, this is cobra one.
Open bravo South. Over.


3
00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:12.592
You bitches!
You bad man!


4
00:04:12.888 --> 00:04:15.308
You got to shoot them in the head!

5
00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:17.616
You torture me... 
I torture you!

6
00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:37.786
12-hour rotations.

7
00:04:37.784 --> 00:04:40.834
Suicide watch every 3 minutes.

8
00:04:41.432 --> 00:04:44.942
Do not let that repetition
lower your guard.


9
00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:48.198
That's exactly what these
guys are looking for.


10
00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:49.454
You got to remember...

11
00:04:49.453 --> 00:04:53.363
some of these dudes have been
locked up in here for eight years.


12
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.200
They've been in here before some
of you were even in high school.


13
00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:01.026
They know the procedure better than you do.

14
00:05:01.022 --> 00:05:05.492
They will test you,
and they will best you.

15
00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:11.008
And make no mistake about it...
this is a war zone.


16
00:05:11.003 --> 00:05:16.963
Now, they ain't using roadside bombs,
and we're not using F-16s.


17
00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.708
This is still a war zone.

18
00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:25.654
Now...Some of you might think you're
here to prevent them from leaving.


19
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.640
You're not.

20
00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:32.097
The walls do that for us.

21
00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:37.292
You are here to prevent them from dying.

22
00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:40.146
Yes?

23
00:05:40.145 --> 00:05:42.295
Uh, how often do we move the prisoners?

24
00:05:42.294 --> 00:05:44.524
- Detainees.
- What?


25
00:05:44.522 --> 00:05:48.982
You will refer to them as "detainees."
You will not call them "prisoners."


26
00:05:48.977 --> 00:05:50.797
You all got that?

27
00:05:50.796 --> 00:05:54.856
No exceptions.
De-tai-nees.


28
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.150
Why can't we call them prisoners?

29
00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:03.716
Prisoners are subject to the Geneva
convention... detainees are not.


30
00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:05.752
Rec yard is right down there.

31
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.380
Showers are right beside 'em.

32
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.190
Unless they're going to medical,
being transferred... that's it.


33
00:06:11.186 --> 00:06:12.786
That's their world.

34
00:06:12.784 --> 00:06:14.744
Is that door shut?

35
00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:16.292
Good.

36
00:06:18.248 --> 00:06:21.868
This... this is your world.

37
00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:24.236
No detainees back here.

38
00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:27.093
On your right, gun Sally.

39
00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:32.041
Remember, on the walk,
the only weapon you have is your radio.


40
00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:34.346
Don't be afraid to use it.

41
00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:40.164
Over here, this is our security
command or observation...


42
00:06:40.158 --> 00:06:42.828
our eyes and ears on the whole block.

43
00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:46.606
So if you find yourself going up
against an uncooperative detainee,


44
00:06:46.602 --> 00:06:49.682
remember you're being watched.

45
00:06:49.968 --> 00:06:54.248
Last but not least, the mess hall.

46
00:06:54.244 --> 00:06:58.784
Like most places on earth, the chicken
fingers are the only thing worth eating.


47
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.900
Hard to fuck those up.

48
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:05.038
And don't bother telling me the coke's flat
'cause I already fucking know.


49
00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:08.324
Echo one, cobra one, Charlie Bronson.
I'll say again.


50
00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:11.151
- Hold on... the natives is getting restless.
- Over.


51
00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:12.349
Roger, echo one.

52
00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.978
Charlie Bronson, echo one.

53
00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:15.936
Oscar Mike, over.

54
00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:21.834
"Charlie Bronson's" our brevity code
for an Irf... that's initial reaction force.


55
00:07:21.828 --> 00:07:26.918
It's a four-man team called in when
shit hits the fan on the walk.


56
00:07:29.092 --> 00:07:33.412
Anybody feel like getting their feet wet?

57
00:07:48.883 --> 00:07:53.093
Listen. All you need to worry
about is his right hand, okay?


58
00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:54.918
Each of us takes one.

59
00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:57.687
Leg, leg, arm, head.

60
00:07:57.684 --> 00:07:59.564
Don't worry about nothing else.

61
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:02.772
You just keep your eye on his right hand,
and you gain control of it... got it?


62
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.970
Roger.

63
00:08:03.968 --> 00:08:05.408
And stay behind me.

64
00:08:05.407 --> 00:08:08.837
Let us get the
rest of him under control.

65
00:08:09.024 --> 00:08:11.144
Hold up. Hold up.

66
00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:13.292
- No names on the block.
- Yeah.


67
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.890
- Okay?
- Yeah.


68
00:08:14.888 --> 00:08:18.968
You can talk to 'em, but do not let
these guys know anything about you.


69
00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:21.364
Do not let them get inside your head.
You got it?


70
00:08:21.362 --> 00:08:22.942
Yeah.

71
00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:26.859
All right, grab our shields.
Let's go.


72
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.000
Spyglass, pop 1-9.

73
00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:49.416
Stay tight.

74
00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:51.295
- Stay tight, all right?
- We got this.


75
00:08:51.294 --> 00:08:53.824
Detainee, get back!

76
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.730
Get back, detainee!

77
00:08:56.728 --> 00:08:58.438
Get back!

78
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.770
Get him pinned up.
Let's go.


79
00:09:09.146 --> 00:09:10.676
Go!

80
00:09:22.274 --> 00:09:26.254
Come on.
Private, give me those cuffs!


81
00:09:29.887 --> 00:09:31.517
Shit!

82
00:09:31.516 --> 00:09:34.646
Get your ass down!

83
00:09:45.682 --> 00:09:47.012
Ohh!

84
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.940
You piece of shit!

85
00:09:48.938 --> 00:09:50.708
Get his arm back!

86
00:09:50.816 --> 00:09:56.316
Get him on...
Get down, you piece of shit!


87
00:09:56.312 --> 00:09:58.572
Get his other hand.

88
00:09:58.569 --> 00:10:00.719
Get the fuck up.

89
00:10:01.856 --> 00:10:04.626
Out of here... get him out of here.

90
00:10:07.322 --> 00:10:10.502
That's it... get down.

91
00:10:25.064 --> 00:10:29.394
All right, pull that strap down.
You want his hand all the way secure.


92
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.140
Make it as tight as you can.
Check his waist.


93
00:10:35.264 --> 00:10:38.174
Check the belt around his waist.
Check that side.


94
00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:41.242
We don't want this guy
going anywhere on us.


95
00:10:41.238 --> 00:10:44.068
Let's roll him out.

96
00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:07.716
Welcome to gitmo.

97
00:11:25.686 --> 00:11:29.716
Oh, Jackson, did you
copy those DVDs for me?


98
00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:31.663
And when exactly was
I supposed to do that?

99
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.900
I mean, I had C.O. standing over
my shoulder all day.


100
00:11:33.898 --> 00:11:35.528
Dude, what the fuck?

101
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.728
Johnson is, like, up my ass
about getting it back.


102
00:11:37.724 --> 00:11:39.064
Copy that shit for me.

103
00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:41.044
Wait. Don't you got kids, anyway?
Why don't you...


104
00:11:41.042 --> 00:11:42.972
- Yeah.
- You ass.


105
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.310
So, what... I can't watch porn?

106
00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:46.838
Are you telling me your dad didn't
have a stack of nudie mags?


107
00:11:46.836 --> 00:11:49.286
He'd to have something to
put over your mom's face.


108
00:11:49.284 --> 00:11:50.754
Oh!

109
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.082
Oh, you're so...

110
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:54.691
That's cold.
That's cold as ice.


111
00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:57.189
You all right?

112
00:11:59.524 --> 00:12:02.604
Yeah. I'm good. Thanks.

113
00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:05.562
Yo, what was that Irf like?

114
00:12:08.006 --> 00:12:09.616
Loud.

115
00:12:10.833 --> 00:12:12.473
Shit.

116
00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:15.192
You didn't think I could handle it?

117
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.930
No, that's not what I'm trying to say.

118
00:12:17.926 --> 00:12:20.626
You know, I just didn't
think you'd want to.


119
00:12:20.624 --> 00:12:24.024
I got to say, of all the companies
I've rotated through here,


120
00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.770
I never had someone get their
ticket punched on the first day.


121
00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:31.416
Just be glad it wasn't a shit cocktail.

122
00:12:31.414 --> 00:12:33.754
What's a shit cocktail?

123
00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:36.502
What the fuck do
you think that is, Rico?

124
00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:39.329
Hey, Cole, what happened?

125
00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:40.926
Uh.

126
00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:46.123
We... we followed two other guys in,
and, um, I was on the left arm.


127
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.170
It was my only thing, and I went...

128
00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:53.357
Pop! She got an elbow right to the lip...
knocked her mask clean off.


129
00:12:53.354 --> 00:12:55.714
Ohh, does it hurt?

130
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.520
Yeah, it fucking hurts.

131
00:12:58.518 --> 00:13:01.208
It looks pretty bad.
Did medical check it out?


132
00:13:01.206 --> 00:13:02.726
It's fine.

133
00:13:02.724 --> 00:13:05.284
You know what it looks like?

134
00:13:05.282 --> 00:13:07.352
It looks like you got herpes.

135
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.840
Hey, no.

136
00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:11.858
Oh, shit! It kind of does.

137
00:13:12.186 --> 00:13:14.116
- You guys.
- No.


138
00:13:14.113 --> 00:13:16.593
You're not gonna get any on
the island now, Cole.


139
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:19.231
Fuck that... I'd hit it, anyway.

140
00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.568
What do you say, Cole?

141
00:13:24.284 --> 00:13:28.284
- Well, then, I really would get herpes.
- Ohh!


142
00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:30.699
Thank you!

143
00:13:30.698 --> 00:13:32.878
She got you...

144
00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:36.355
Oh, damn. Whoo!

145
00:14:05.794 --> 00:14:08.184
<i>- Mom?
- Oh!</i>


146
00:14:08.562 --> 00:14:11.252
<i>Honey, how are you?</i>

147
00:14:11.358 --> 00:14:13.948
Well, things are fine.

148
00:14:13.946 --> 00:14:16.826
Um, the base is real nice.

149
00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:18.654
There's a subway.

150
00:14:18.652 --> 00:14:20.032
<i>A subway?</i>

151
00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:21.611
A subway restaurant, mom.

152
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.130
<i>Oh!</i>

153
00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:26.666
<i>Yeah. And is that your room?</i>

154
00:14:26.664 --> 00:14:29.384
<i>- Yeah.
- Can I see it?</i>


155
00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:34.549
How is everything back home, mom?

156
00:14:34.546 --> 00:14:38.076
<i>Oh. Nothing much ever happens back here...</i>

157
00:14:38.074 --> 00:14:43.114
<i>nothing as exciting as what
you're doing, I'm sure.</i>


158
00:14:43.388 --> 00:14:46.348
It is what it is.
I don't know. I, um...


159
00:14:46.346 --> 00:14:49.226
<i>Honey, you can't just leave
him hanging and expect him to</i>


160
00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.592
<i>be there when you get back.</i>

161
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:54.801
I'm not leaving him hanging,
and I told you I'm not coming back.


162
00:14:54.797 --> 00:14:57.027
I'm going on another deployment, remember?

163
00:14:57.405 --> 00:14:58.965
<i>All right.</i>

164
00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:01.764
<i>So, how about on the base?</i>

165
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.580
<i>Have you met anyone down there?</i>

166
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.570
Mom, seriously, stop.

167
00:15:05.568 --> 00:15:10.188
I'm not dating an army guy, and I did not
join the military to find a husband.


168
00:15:10.183 --> 00:15:12.013
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

169
00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:13.472
<i>Oh!</i>

170
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.120
<i>Look who wants to say hello.</i>

171
00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.126
<i>Say hi, scribbles.</i>

172
00:15:19.124 --> 00:15:20.924
<i>Look who it is!</i>

173
00:15:20.922 --> 00:15:22.632
<i>Look who it is!</i>

174
00:15:22.631 --> 00:15:25.601
<i>Say hi, scribbles.</i>

175
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.730
The weather today... bright and sunny.

176
00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:40.935
High of 85...

177
00:15:40.934 --> 00:15:44.494
Tomorrow, there is a chance of rain...

178
00:15:45.798 --> 00:15:47.648
Thank you, private.

179
00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:50.748
Last week...

180
00:16:30.946 --> 00:16:32.546
Come down here.

181
00:16:32.544 --> 00:16:34.534
Make sure you...

182
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.590
Uh...

183
00:17:59.452 --> 00:18:01.902
You want a book?

184
00:18:03.858 --> 00:18:06.138
Do you want a book?

185
00:18:09.562 --> 00:18:11.762
Hey, calm down.

186
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.590
Calm down. Take a step back.

187
00:18:13.588 --> 00:18:15.458
Take one step back from the glass.

188
00:18:15.456 --> 00:18:18.156
- I can't understand what...
- Yo, Haji!


189
00:18:18.154 --> 00:18:19.814
Chill the fuck out.

190
00:18:19.812 --> 00:18:23.562
- I'll take that book, but you give it to me.
- All right, all right. Chill out.


191
00:18:23.558 --> 00:18:25.358
I got this.

192
00:18:34.408 --> 00:18:36.148
Did I do something wrong?

193
00:18:36.146 --> 00:18:39.306
No. These guys just don't like girls.

194
00:18:39.304 --> 00:18:41.914
It's an arab thing.

195
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.770
You want me to take over?

196
00:18:44.769 --> 00:18:47.949
No. It's okay.
I can handle it.


197
00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:50.556
All right. Suit yourself.

198
00:19:18.008 --> 00:19:21.298
Do you know those books?

199
00:19:24.262 --> 00:19:25.672
What about them?

200
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.250
Do you like them?

201
00:19:27.248 --> 00:19:30.838
You were watching the books.
I'm asking you a question.


202
00:19:34.642 --> 00:19:36.712
What do you want from the cart?

203
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.980
<i>Do you have the new Harry Potter book?</i>

204
00:19:44.622 --> 00:19:47.832
<i>No. This is not
the new Harry Potter book.</i>

205
00:19:47.829 --> 00:19:51.129
This is the old one.
I already read this one.


206
00:19:51.794 --> 00:19:54.164
I want the last book.

207
00:19:54.482 --> 00:19:56.282
Which one's that?

208
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.750
The last book?

209
00:19:57.749 --> 00:20:01.009
It's, you know...
You... you see that book there?


210
00:20:01.006 --> 00:20:03.346
It has no cover on it, huh?

211
00:20:03.344 --> 00:20:04.654
Uh-huh, yes.

212
00:20:04.652 --> 00:20:07.072
That book... it used to have a cover.

213
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.720
I remember I read this cover,
you know, when it has a cover on it.


214
00:20:10.716 --> 00:20:14.496
<i>It was saying that Harry Potter,
it has seven book, you know?</i>


215
00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:17.214
You guys only have six book.

216
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.240
Huh?

217
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.560
I don't know what to tell you... I...
- You know how long I'm asking for this book?


218
00:20:21.556 --> 00:20:24.226
No, you don't. You're new.

219
00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:25.394
Two years.

220
00:20:25.393 --> 00:20:29.633
Imagine, two years I'm asking you
guys to give me this last book.


221
00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:31.918
You know what happens
at the end of book six?


222
00:20:31.917 --> 00:20:33.657
- No.
- No.


223
00:20:33.656 --> 00:20:35.536
- I...
- You know, me,


224
00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:39.343
always, always thinking that
Snape is a bad guy, okay?


225
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.630
Then I was thinking, no,
actually, he is not a bad guy...


226
00:20:42.626 --> 00:20:44.066
he is the good guy.

227
00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:46.086
Then after I read the book six,

228
00:20:46.084 --> 00:20:49.314
- I don't know what to think now.
- Do you want this book or not?


229
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.820
You're not listening, huh?

230
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:53.558
- I read this book...
- No, no.


231
00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:54.726
You are not listening to me.

232
00:20:54.725 --> 00:20:55.865
...10 times.

233
00:20:55.864 --> 00:20:57.174
I read this book.

234
00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.133
- I want the new book.
- I'm telling you we don't have it.


235
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.090
It ain't here.
What we have is on the cart.


236
00:21:02.088 --> 00:21:04.268
What do you want?

237
00:21:07.632 --> 00:21:11.522
Give me the "Azkaban" instead.

238
00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:18.196
Is that one of these arab books?

239
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.710
"Prisoner of Azkaban," book number three.

240
00:21:30.002 --> 00:21:32.262
Yeah.

241
00:21:34.977 --> 00:21:36.557
Here you go.

242
00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:39.526
Hey. What... what...
what else do you got?


243
00:21:39.522 --> 00:21:43.252
I got books, and I got newspapers.
Use your eyes.


244
00:21:43.248 --> 00:21:44.848
I'm using my eyes.

245
00:21:44.847 --> 00:21:46.947
That newspaper is two months old.

246
00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:49.496
Now, why do I have to know
the news for two months old?


247
00:21:49.492 --> 00:21:50.832
So, you're good then?

248
00:21:50.832 --> 00:21:52.842
Hold on your horses, huh?

249
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.260
No one is going nowhere here...

250
00:21:55.258 --> 00:21:57.258
at least, I'm not.

251
00:21:57.256 --> 00:21:59.966
What is that picture?

252
00:22:00.502 --> 00:22:02.602
That book.

253
00:22:04.368 --> 00:22:05.618
No, no, go.

254
00:22:05.618 --> 00:22:07.248
Go, go. Go.

255
00:22:07.246 --> 00:22:08.146
Too much.

256
00:22:08.146 --> 00:22:09.506
Go back.

257
00:22:09.504 --> 00:22:11.244
Uh-huh.

258
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.570
What is it?

259
00:22:16.407 --> 00:22:19.157
"My Antonia."

260
00:22:19.614 --> 00:22:22.004
Is it a good book or...

261
00:22:22.002 --> 00:22:24.102
I don't know. I haven't read it.

262
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.940
Okay. Just tell me what the cover says,
on the back.


263
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.260
"In 19th century Nebraska,
the spirited daughter of an immigrant..."


264
00:22:37.258 --> 00:22:38.808
Nebraska?

265
00:22:38.806 --> 00:22:41.416
You said... what was it?

266
00:22:41.413 --> 00:22:44.193
It... it's a place in America.

267
00:22:44.431 --> 00:22:46.911
Okay. Uh-huh.

268
00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:49.408
That... what kind of place is this?

269
00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:51.506
Nebraska?

270
00:22:53.292 --> 00:22:54.842
Flat.

271
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.340
Flat.

272
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.730
Time's up.

273
00:22:57.728 --> 00:22:59.108
- Hey.
- Keep it moving.


274
00:22:59.106 --> 00:23:01.106
Hey, I... moptop?

275
00:23:01.124 --> 00:23:02.804
Bad timing, okay?

276
00:23:04.002 --> 00:23:06.692
Me and blondie... we were having
a very beautiful conversation.


277
00:23:06.689 --> 00:23:07.509
Uh-huh.

278
00:23:07.508 --> 00:23:11.698
And you come here always trying
to be a big fucking asshole.


279
00:23:11.694 --> 00:23:13.004
You know what?

280
00:23:13.003 --> 00:23:16.213
<i>I think you guys don't have
the lastHarry Potter on purpose.</i>


281
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.170
You like to drive us crazy.

282
00:23:18.168 --> 00:23:20.508
But I'm not going crazy.

283
00:23:20.506 --> 00:23:24.636
Huh? Happy me.
I'm not going crazy... not me!


284
00:24:02.796 --> 00:24:05.626
At 2100, detainees on Charlie block

285
00:24:05.624 --> 00:24:08.294
complained of a foul-smelling
odor coming from ventilation.


286
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.490
Maintenance was called.

287
00:24:10.488 --> 00:24:15.498
At 2200, detainee 9-1-2 was found with
seven strings of different colors.


288
00:24:15.494 --> 00:24:20.014
He appeared to be weaving them
together, possibly to form a weapon.


289
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:24.710
At 0500, detainee 4-9 was transferred
to medical for pain in the abdomen.


290
00:24:24.706 --> 00:24:27.106
Diagnosis was constipation.

291
00:24:27.102 --> 00:24:29.762
We have 3-6 moves scheduled,

292
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.070
All detainees accounted for.

293
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.840
Atten-hut!
Honor bound.


294
00:24:33.836 --> 00:24:36.096
To defend freedom.

295
00:25:31.681 --> 00:25:35.221
Hey, blondie,

296
00:25:35.218 --> 00:25:39.518
tell me...
how do you like it here so far?


297
00:25:42.642 --> 00:25:44.162
Huh?

298
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.040
Blondie.

299
00:25:49.294 --> 00:25:51.964
Where are you from?

300
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.270
Okay, tell me your name.

301
00:25:58.076 --> 00:25:59.766
No?

302
00:26:00.904 --> 00:26:03.794
My name is Ali...

303
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.020
Ali Amir.

304
00:26:06.618 --> 00:26:10.368
Here, they call me 4-7-1.

305
00:26:13.712 --> 00:26:16.352
You don't like to talk?

306
00:26:16.348 --> 00:26:20.158
Always, it's like that. Why?
I don't know why you guys...


307
00:26:20.156 --> 00:26:22.926
you don't like to talk with us.

308
00:26:22.922 --> 00:26:26.352
You and us... we are both stuck here.

309
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.260
It is boring for both of us.

310
00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:32.906
And you and me got nothing
to say to each other.


311
00:26:33.582 --> 00:26:36.732
<i>Okay. You don't like to read
Harry Potter book?</i>


312
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:41.360
You don't like to read that book about...
what was that place, the flat place?


313
00:26:41.355 --> 00:26:43.635
Uh, Nebraska?

314
00:26:43.993 --> 00:26:47.773
Tell me what you like to read, huh?

315
00:26:48.988 --> 00:26:51.968
Oh! You are a soldier.

316
00:26:51.966 --> 00:26:55.386
And soldiers... they don't like books.

317
00:26:56.601 --> 00:26:58.971
I thought you only read the Qur'an.

318
00:26:58.968 --> 00:27:01.088
The Qur'an, yes.

319
00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:04.406
We... I
-I've read it one million times.

320
00:27:04.404 --> 00:27:05.524
You know what?

321
00:27:05.522 --> 00:27:10.772
Ehan, there in 108... he has
memorized it, the whole book.


322
00:27:10.768 --> 00:27:12.178
Hey, Ehan!

323
00:27:12.176 --> 00:27:16.096
Tell something to blondie from the Qur'an.

324
00:27:25.553 --> 00:27:28.053
I think he's trying to tell
you to leave me alone.


325
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:28.951
Ehan!

326
00:27:35.254 --> 00:27:37.024
Hey, blondie.

327
00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:40.262
You know, I read your Bible, too.

328
00:27:41.158 --> 00:27:47.278
My opinion about Bible is the first
half of the book... it is very good.


329
00:27:47.412 --> 00:27:54.672
It has armies, plenty of magic,
which I like very much... things like that.


330
00:27:54.666 --> 00:27:58.966
But, you know, the second half...
it has some magic, but not too much.


331
00:27:58.962 --> 00:28:00.782
It is boring.

332
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.510
Well, you don't diss my holy book...
I won't diss yours.


333
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.180
So you're Christian?

334
00:28:13.698 --> 00:28:19.028
Tell me something...
how did you pick your Christianity?


335
00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:25.030
It was your parents, hmm?

336
00:28:25.027 --> 00:28:27.147
And cut the Hannibal Lecter shit.

337
00:28:27.144 --> 00:28:29.434
Just keep it down.

338
00:28:31.091 --> 00:28:32.751
What?

339
00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:36.631
What is Hannibal Lecter?

340
00:29:36.628 --> 00:29:38.038
I said, keep it down.

341
00:29:38.037 --> 00:29:40.737
Yeah. I'm... I'm trying to
understand what you are telling me.


342
00:29:40.735 --> 00:29:43.185
You were saying that stop Hannibal Lecter,

343
00:29:43.182 --> 00:29:46.582
so I have to know what Hannibal
Lecter is, then I stop doing that.


344
00:29:46.579 --> 00:29:49.619
He's a guy in a
movie that talks too much.

345
00:29:49.616 --> 00:29:52.556
I haven't heard about this movie.

346
00:29:52.554 --> 00:29:56.254
Well, it's probably banned
where you're from, anyway.


347
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.330
You mean in Germany?

348
00:30:00.356 --> 00:30:01.446
Huh?

349
00:30:01.444 --> 00:30:03.724
I'm... hey.
I'm... hey!


350
00:30:03.722 --> 00:30:06.882
I'm talking with you, blondie!

351
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.850
Okay. I-I-it's... it's
no more talking, huh?


352
00:30:11.126 --> 00:30:12.506
Huh?

353
00:30:12.504 --> 00:30:16.674
You are always trying to
be all of you assholes.


354
00:30:30.697 --> 00:30:37.227
I don't know how I cannot get one soldier
here who likes to talk about books.


355
00:30:40.807 --> 00:30:45.457
Okay. You don't like to talk.
Bring me some water, please.


356
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.190
Blondie. I'm thirsty.

357
00:30:52.166 --> 00:30:54.016
Where's your Qur'an?

358
00:30:54.014 --> 00:30:58.174
Are you giving me
some water, please, or not?


359
00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:03.260
Okay, you bring me the water...
I stop talking, I promise.


360
00:31:18.891 --> 00:31:22.371
You wouldn't need this if you
didn't talk so damn much.


361
00:31:24.835 --> 00:31:26.305
Ah!

362
00:31:39.822 --> 00:31:41.722
Shit.

363
00:31:45.476 --> 00:31:46.886
Shit. Are you all right?

364
00:31:46.884 --> 00:31:48.764
- Oh, man, let me help you.
- Motherfucker.


365
00:31:48.762 --> 00:31:50.342
Clean yourself up.
We'll take care of this.


366
00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:52.211
Hey, back the fuck up
and shut the bean hole.


367
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.060
He's probably got another cocktail.

368
00:31:54.548 --> 00:31:55.888
Oh, fuck.

369
00:32:05.347 --> 00:32:06.947
Quiet down.

370
00:32:06.946 --> 00:32:09.636
4-7-1, take the towel down now.

371
00:32:09.632 --> 00:32:11.352
- Fuck you!
- Take it down now!


372
00:32:11.352 --> 00:32:13.362
No, no.
We need to call an Irf.


373
00:32:14.338 --> 00:32:15.568
Hold on.

374
00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.737
Open that thing.

375
00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:18.746
No, no. No.

376
00:32:18.744 --> 00:32:20.724
- We need to call an Irf.
- Calm down.


377
00:32:20.722 --> 00:32:22.602
I'm already covered in his shit!
Open it up!


378
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.370
We are not opening the fucking bean hole.

379
00:32:24.369 --> 00:32:27.389
- Now, you need to calm down.
- No, we are not opening that up.


380
00:32:29.834 --> 00:32:31.764
You stupid fuckers...Huh?!

381
00:32:31.762 --> 00:32:36.032
I went to university!
I know my rights!


382
00:32:37.496 --> 00:32:40.296
Hey, back up, fucker!

383
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.040
Shit. One more time.
Open the fucking thing up.


384
00:32:47.037 --> 00:32:48.617
"F" you.

385
00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:50.876
Do it!

386
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.610
Back away from the door.

387
00:33:02.103 --> 00:33:03.843
Nice. Nice, nice. Nice, nice.

388
00:33:03.842 --> 00:33:05.582
Good, good, good, good, good. Good.

389
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.400
Yeah, bitch.

390
00:33:07.728 --> 00:33:10.588
- Nice.
-Shit, he's got a second towel.


391
00:33:10.584 --> 00:33:12.324
Seriously?

392
00:33:13.952 --> 00:33:15.452
Fuck.

393
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.400
Shit, man.

394
00:33:19.986 --> 00:33:21.296
Irf him.

395
00:33:21.295 --> 00:33:24.285
You Americans treat us like animals?!

396
00:33:24.282 --> 00:33:26.402
Okay, I am an animal!

397
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.310
Bravo two, code one, 
Charlie Bronson.

398
00:33:33.853 --> 00:33:36.863
Oh, watch yourselves.
If they start covering their Qur'ans,


399
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.480
it means they're gonna start
throwing shit around!


400
00:33:39.748 --> 00:33:41.348
You don't read anything!

401
00:33:41.346 --> 00:33:43.636
I read book!
I read history!


402
00:33:43.633 --> 00:33:45.973
I can't win!

403
00:33:51.436 --> 00:33:54.016
Irf! Irf! Irf!

404
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:20.410
Cocktail?

405
00:34:21.178 --> 00:34:23.108
Sir, yes, sir.

406
00:34:23.106 --> 00:34:24.956
At ease.

407
00:34:26.044 --> 00:34:29.144
Did medical check you out yet?

408
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.210
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

409
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.400
Why don't you, uh, take it easy
for the rest of the shift?


410
00:34:43.407 --> 00:34:47.407
See if observation needs any help.

411
00:34:47.842 --> 00:34:50.752
Thank you, sir.
I'm fine.


412
00:34:54.496 --> 00:34:58.746
Use the vinegar.
It helps with the smell.


413
00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.926
Hey.

414
00:35:16.924 --> 00:35:20.164
Mmm. Cole, you smell amazing.

415
00:35:20.162 --> 00:35:22.742
What's that you're wearing... chanel no. 2?

416
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.370
Mm-hmm.

417
00:35:24.368 --> 00:35:28.478
You better watch yourself with those.
They drug them to keep them docile.


418
00:35:28.474 --> 00:35:31.084
Shit. No, they don't.

419
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.620
Hey. What are you doing here?
Did medical check you out?


420
00:35:34.618 --> 00:35:35.678
I'm fine.

421
00:35:35.676 --> 00:35:38.016
We're short a meal, though.
Do you mind grabbing one?


422
00:35:38.014 --> 00:35:39.324
No, we're not.

423
00:35:39.324 --> 00:35:42.614
Your pal 471... he's not coming back today.

424
00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.780
Why?

425
00:35:43.779 --> 00:35:46.389
- I sent him on a flyer.
What's that?


426
00:35:46.387 --> 00:35:48.537
Our frequent flyer program.

427
00:35:48.534 --> 00:35:51.554
We move him from cell to
cell every two hours.


428
00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:55.802
Night shift won't like it, but fuck 'em.
Dude's got to learn somehow.


429
00:35:55.798 --> 00:35:57.968
You move him all night long?

430
00:35:57.966 --> 00:35:59.906
All night, all day, all week.

431
00:35:59.904 --> 00:36:01.584
How does he sleep?

432
00:36:01.582 --> 00:36:04.282
He doesn't, dummy... that's the point.

433
00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.160
Come on, get this shit moving.
We're on a schedule.


434
00:36:07.156 --> 00:36:08.486
It's brutal.

435
00:36:08.845 --> 00:36:10.825
What are you... the red cross?

436
00:36:10.824 --> 00:36:13.084
No, I'm just saying.
It's...Brutal.


437
00:36:13.082 --> 00:36:16.162
I mean, Jesus, Rico, Cole just got shit
flung at her face. Are you cool with that?


438
00:36:16.158 --> 00:36:17.238
Of course not.

439
00:36:17.238 --> 00:36:20.558
I mean, you don't have to do some
big thing over me. I'm... I'm fine.


440
00:36:20.554 --> 00:36:22.054
Yeah, we kind of do.

00:36:22.052 --> 00:36:23.762
And just so we're clear, 
I'm down with it.

442
00:36:23.762 --> 00:36:27.062
I just think, you know,
it's kind of hard-core, right?


443
00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:30.916
You want me to call it off?

444
00:36:31.974 --> 00:36:34.534
No. Fuck him.

446
00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:49.399

447
00:36:49.646 --> 00:36:51.686

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.980
You want me to bait it for you?

459

No, I think I'm pretty good. Thanks.

460

It's a treble hook.

get it on all three.

Like that?

464
00:37:33.485 --> 00:37:34.745
Not bad.

465
00:37:34.744 --> 00:37:36.534
Hey, give me this shit.

466
00:37:36.532 --> 00:37:37.922
Hold this.

How do you do this thing, anyways?

468
00:37:41.018 --> 00:37:42.678
How do you do the pole?

469
00:37:42.676 --> 00:37:43.766
Yeah.

470
00:37:43.764 --> 00:37:45.454
Yo, I've never done this before, man.

471
00:37:45.454 --> 00:37:47.574
Look, the hook's right there.
You got to put bait on it.


472
00:37:47.572 --> 00:37:50.722
Oh. You cast the fucker out, get a fish,
and you reel it back in.


473
00:37:50.718 --> 00:37:52.548
Real simple.

474
00:37:52.547 --> 00:37:53.987
Shit, be my guest.

475
00:37:53.986 --> 00:37:55.046
...pulling your ass out of there.

476
00:37:55.044 --> 00:37:56.814
There you go.

477
00:37:57.922 --> 00:38:00.562
I like to see the hook.

478
00:38:01.268 --> 00:38:02.708
Well, see that?

479
00:38:02.706 --> 00:38:05.046
He knows what kind of fish...

480
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.440
Here you go.

481
00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:13.209
Thanks.

482
00:38:15.185 --> 00:38:16.765
Whoo!

483
00:38:17.284 --> 00:38:20.604
Come on, girl, let's get some fish.

484
00:38:24.266 --> 00:38:27.746
You're dropping on me.
Let's go. Let's go.


485
00:38:28.642 --> 00:38:29.862
Whoo!

486
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.220
All right, listen up, you fucking faggots!

487
00:38:34.216 --> 00:38:37.396
We got fresh beer on tap,
so I want you to fall in.


488
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.800
Let's go.

489
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.270
Cole, come on.

490
00:38:44.268 --> 00:38:45.958
Come on.

491
00:38:47.564 --> 00:38:50.444
Here. Here, precious motherfucker.

492
00:38:50.442 --> 00:38:51.752
She can handle it.

493
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.270
You can't.

494
00:38:53.788 --> 00:38:57.408
Yeah, one time in, uh, high school,
freshman year, me and my boys...


495
00:38:57.404 --> 00:39:00.934
we needed to go to the
liquor store, pick up a...


496
00:39:00.932 --> 00:39:04.062
I'd take the whole fucking
thing down by myself.


497
00:39:05.776 --> 00:39:08.276
Why don't you bring
me over a hot dog?

498
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.280
<i>♪ Whoo, boy ♪</i>

499
00:39:14.279 --> 00:39:15.639

00:39:19.094 --> 00:39:21.594

Ohh!

505
00:39:46.089 --> 00:39:49.269
- Let's go.
- Can I get your autograph?


506
00:39:56.358 --> 00:39:57.638
Oh.

507
00:40:23.294 --> 00:40:24.904
Mnh.

508
00:40:46.321 --> 00:40:49.071
Shit. That's... sorry.

509
00:40:51.786 --> 00:40:53.256
Hey.

510
00:40:53.254 --> 00:40:56.104
- It's real nice.
- That ain't... that ain't mine.


511
00:40:56.102 --> 00:40:58.852
- That's the communal stash.
- Mm-hmm.


512
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.400
Is this what you like?

513
00:41:45.715 --> 00:41:49.255
Slow down a little bit, all right?

514
00:41:57.544 --> 00:41:58.844
Oh.

515
00:41:58.842 --> 00:42:00.962
Yeah. Don't move.

516
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.200
Mnh, stop, okay?

517
00:42:04.198 --> 00:42:06.298
Hey, stop!

518
00:42:06.894 --> 00:42:08.844
Fuck!

519
00:42:12.758 --> 00:42:15.048
I'm sorry.

520
00:42:18.684 --> 00:42:21.024
Fuck you, bitch!

521
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:23.281
Hey, where have you been?
You all right?


522
00:42:23.279 --> 00:42:24.809
Hey, come here.
What's wrong? What's wrong?


523
00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:26.138
I'm fine.

524
00:42:33.389 --> 00:42:35.619
Hey, Cole.

525
00:42:40.652 --> 00:42:42.062
Shit.

526
00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:43.642
Shit.

527
00:42:50.354 --> 00:42:53.054
4-7-1, wake up.

528
00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.630
No, no. Not again.

529
00:42:55.628 --> 00:42:57.588
Leave me alone.

530
00:42:57.586 --> 00:42:58.756
Come on, on your feet.

531
00:42:58.755 --> 00:43:00.745
Back to the door.
You know the drill.


532
00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:02.594
Fuck you.

533
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.440
Sleep tight.

534
00:44:01.406 --> 00:44:02.446
Hey.

535
00:44:02.444 --> 00:44:04.614
Hey, what's up?

536
00:44:04.613 --> 00:44:07.393
Is 471 still on his frequent flyer program?

537
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:09.160
Yup.

538
00:44:13.614 --> 00:44:15.574
Mecca?

539
00:44:15.952 --> 00:44:20.002
Well, it damn sure ain't
pointing to Disneyland.


540
00:44:46.942 --> 00:44:48.762
He's quite the artist.

541
00:44:48.761 --> 00:44:49.771
Mm-hmm.

542
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.520
The guy's a regular "poocasso."

543
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:58.636
What... you haven't heard that one yet?

544
00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:06.376
What will you do with that?

545
00:45:06.374 --> 00:45:09.474
Write it up and
hand it off to G.I.S.

546
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:12.930
Intelligence gathering for that?

547
00:45:12.928 --> 00:45:15.238
That's the S.O.P.

548
00:45:15.974 --> 00:45:18.224
Seems like a waste of time.

549
00:45:18.222 --> 00:45:22.092
Yeah, well, that also seems
to be the S.O.P. Around here.


550
00:45:25.836 --> 00:45:28.396
You know... hey, will you
go get the chaplain for me?


551
00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.242
I need him to search that Qur'an.

552
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:31.661
Yeah.

553
00:45:36.575 --> 00:45:39.025
It's small in here.

554
00:45:39.652 --> 00:45:43.322
Yeah, you ain't kidding.

555
00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.980
- Hey, Bergen.
- Yeah, what's up?


556
00:48:21.978 --> 00:48:24.488
You know what that brevity code means?

557
00:48:24.486 --> 00:48:26.716
- "Alfred Hitchcock on the block"?
- Yeah.


558
00:48:26.713 --> 00:48:29.543
That is a shrink visited the detainee.

559
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.390
- Really?
- Yeah.


560
00:48:34.026 --> 00:48:36.386
There's a whole bunch of 'em in here.

561
00:48:36.384 --> 00:48:38.914
Dude's a head case.

562
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.460
- Thanks.
- Yeah, man.


563
00:48:55.046 --> 00:48:56.146
Hey.

564
00:48:56.146 --> 00:48:57.756
Hey.

565
00:48:57.754 --> 00:48:59.984
Tough week, huh?

566
00:49:00.931 --> 00:49:02.651
Yeah.

567
00:49:04.437 --> 00:49:08.687
I mean, like, I handle it, you know.
I'm not tripping or anything. It's just...


568
00:49:08.684 --> 00:49:11.044
No, yeah. Um, yeah, me too.

569
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.700
Yeah.

570
00:49:16.915 --> 00:49:19.715
It's kind of a weird situation, though.

571
00:49:19.713 --> 00:49:21.753
I know, right?

572
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:25.650
Fucking detainees, man.
What's their fucking problem?


573
00:49:34.588 --> 00:49:37.548
- Well, where were you?
- Yeah.


574
00:49:42.141 --> 00:49:45.271
Hey, do you guys get any
of that detainee chow?


575
00:49:45.268 --> 00:49:46.848
That shit looks good.

576
00:49:46.846 --> 00:49:50.086
Nope. We're not supposed to touch it
if there's any left over, either.


577
00:49:50.084 --> 00:49:51.164
Fuck!

578
00:49:51.163 --> 00:49:54.623
Fucking detainees...
they get all the breaks, right?


579
00:49:58.916 --> 00:50:01.416
<i>Have you ever read Harry Potter?</i>

580
00:50:02.362 --> 00:50:04.682
The kids' book?

581
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.720
No, why?

582
00:50:09.186 --> 00:50:11.606
No reason.

583
00:51:29.489 --> 00:51:32.099
You know Sudoku?

584
00:51:32.996 --> 00:51:35.356
Yeah, sure.

585
00:51:35.873 --> 00:51:39.033
You know, I have
done all these books here,

586
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:43.600
so I have to
make my own, you know?

587
00:51:45.364 --> 00:51:47.914
Well...

588
00:51:50.769 --> 00:51:53.159
It's pretty.

589
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:03.550
You know, it's not just the drawing.
You know what I mean?


590
00:52:03.547 --> 00:52:07.737
The numbers are very hard to figure out.

591
00:52:07.732 --> 00:52:11.052
You... you cannot just put any number in.

592
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.840
Yeah, I know.

593
00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:19.048
Those men who do these books,
you know, they do it all by computers.


594
00:52:19.472 --> 00:52:24.072
But to do it in your head, it's... it's...
it's hard.


595
00:52:24.068 --> 00:52:26.358
You must be very smart, but...

596
00:52:26.355 --> 00:52:30.785
I have gone to university, you know?

597
00:52:33.908 --> 00:52:36.168
Are you sure it works?

598
00:52:36.166 --> 00:52:40.766
Of course it works, yes.
What? You don't believe me?


599
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.370
Okay. Come here.

600
00:52:43.368 --> 00:52:46.768
I will give it to you.
You can... I want you to keep it.


601
00:52:46.766 --> 00:52:48.726
Now, you can see it for yourself,

602
00:52:48.724 --> 00:52:53.374
but you don't tell me that it's
fake 'cause you cannot solve it.


603
00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.140
Yeah?

604
00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:57.138
No, thanks.

605
00:52:57.396 --> 00:52:59.566
You... you don't like puzzles?

606
00:52:59.564 --> 00:53:02.504
No, it's just... it's just the rules.

607
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:06.010
Rule? Okay, okay.
Bring this box.


608
00:53:06.008 --> 00:53:08.708
- I will put it in the box and...
- Hey, I can't.


609
00:53:08.704 --> 00:53:10.494
I'm sorry.

610
00:53:22.022 --> 00:53:23.272
Why?

611
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:28.440
You... you... you think this paper
will hurt you somehow, huh?


612
00:53:30.994 --> 00:53:35.914
Huh? You think that I will kill
you with this piece of paper?


613
00:53:35.908 --> 00:53:39.938
Huh? You say the rules.
What does fucking rule says?


614
00:53:39.936 --> 00:53:43.336
Maybe you think that you're
getting disease from me.


615
00:53:43.332 --> 00:53:44.962
Yeah? That is it, maybe?

616
00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.450
That's why you guys are always
wearing your rubber gloves.


617
00:53:48.447 --> 00:53:50.617
You guys don't even like to touch us.

618
00:53:50.615 --> 00:53:54.345
- You don't...
- Hey, calm down. I didn't say that.


619
00:53:54.341 --> 00:53:56.871
No. You know, you... let me tell you.

620
00:53:56.869 --> 00:54:00.189
You figured it out all, you know?

621
00:54:00.186 --> 00:54:03.126
This was a secret message.

622
00:54:03.124 --> 00:54:04.314
Look at this.

623
00:54:04.312 --> 00:54:08.842
I was going to send this to all
my Al-qaedas friends in New York,


624
00:54:08.838 --> 00:54:12.368
- and this was my big escape plan.
- Don't... don't do that.


625
00:54:12.364 --> 00:54:15.004
Gone. See? Whhht!

626
00:54:15.002 --> 00:54:18.292
It's now in their hands, okay?

627
00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:20.708
I was trying to be nice with you.

628
00:54:20.706 --> 00:54:23.296
I
-I
-I wasn't being asshole to you.

629
00:54:23.294 --> 00:54:25.654
I don't know why you are
being asshole to me.


630
00:54:25.652 --> 00:54:27.992
I am not being an asshole to you.
I...


631
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.500
I think you... yes, yes, yes, you are.
Yes.


632
00:54:30.498 --> 00:54:32.368
Fuck you!

633
00:54:38.489 --> 00:54:41.509
You locked up us here for years!

634
00:54:41.507 --> 00:54:43.977
For what?!

635
00:54:44.384 --> 00:54:49.064
To show the world that you are
good guy and we are bad guy?!


636
00:54:49.548 --> 00:54:51.148
Fuck you!

637
00:54:51.147 --> 00:54:53.897
You and America are the bad guy!

638
00:54:54.854 --> 00:54:59.474
- You American are the real terrorists!
- Hey, keep it down!


639
00:55:27.064 --> 00:55:30.514
I looked for your book, you know?

640
00:55:31.929 --> 00:55:37.119
<i>YourHarry Potter book...
it's not in the library.</i>


641
00:55:37.114 --> 00:55:40.714
You're fooling with me, huh?

642
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.200
No.

643
00:55:42.198 --> 00:55:45.198
No, it's really not there.

644
00:55:54.626 --> 00:55:57.856
You're sure it's not there?

645
00:55:58.404 --> 00:55:59.874
Huh?

646
00:56:00.411 --> 00:56:04.931
Are you sure the
book is not there 'cause,

647
00:56:04.928 --> 00:56:10.398
you know, once, one of these guards...
he told me that he has seen it in the library.


648
00:56:10.582 --> 00:56:13.242
You know... you know,
he... he... he... he was...


649
00:56:13.239 --> 00:56:16.069
keep telling me each week that,
"I will bring it next week.


650
00:56:16.067 --> 00:56:19.177
I will bring it next week,"
but he never bring it for me.


651
00:56:19.174 --> 00:56:23.574
He's probably fucking with you.
It's not there.


652
00:56:56.438 --> 00:57:03.288
I'm sorry for... asking you
too much about these books.


653
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:10.740
You know, it... it's been a very
long time that I have been waiting.


654
00:57:11.714 --> 00:57:17.504
And sometimes, I think that
it's making me crazy...


655
00:57:17.498 --> 00:57:21.478
A little, you know?

656
00:57:23.862 --> 00:57:29.252
Not knowing how all these
things are going to end.


657
00:57:31.256 --> 00:57:35.446
It's been a long time that I'm waiting.

658
00:57:35.441 --> 00:57:38.491
For the book?

659
00:57:40.116 --> 00:57:41.776
Yeah.

660
00:57:41.775 --> 00:57:44.445
Yeah, for the book.

661
00:57:44.442 --> 00:57:48.602
You understand what I am saying?

662
00:57:49.578 --> 00:57:55.208
I can... I can imagine
what it would be like.


663
00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.070
Can you?

664
00:58:01.596 --> 00:58:05.616
Mm. I...Try to.

665
00:58:11.406 --> 00:58:15.896
Then...I will also try.

666
00:59:59.184 --> 01:00:01.984
Hey, 3-6-1...

667
01:00:01.982 --> 01:00:05.822
Chicken piccata is really good today...
better than normal.


668
01:00:05.818 --> 01:00:08.588
You want some?

669
01:00:17.996 --> 01:00:22.186
Come on. No takers?

670
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:27.840
Come on, please?

671
01:00:40.316 --> 01:00:43.606
Well, that makes this day five.

672
01:00:43.602 --> 01:00:46.752
You all know what's coming next.

673
01:00:48.628 --> 01:00:51.458
You want to call it off?

674
01:00:58.248 --> 01:01:01.378
I'll take that as a "no."

675
01:01:14.752 --> 01:01:18.592
Mmm. Butter pecan.

676
01:01:18.878 --> 01:01:21.688
Bon appatit.

677
01:01:33.484 --> 01:01:37.204
How long are we gonna keep doing this?

678
01:01:37.201 --> 01:01:40.091
As long as they can.

679
01:01:40.598 --> 01:01:43.408
Attention on deck.

680
01:01:45.084 --> 01:01:47.044
That's the ringleader?

681
01:01:47.042 --> 01:01:48.972
Yes, sir.

682
01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:51.150
What's he want this time?

683
01:01:51.148 --> 01:01:53.648
Uh, I'm not sure, sir.

684
01:01:53.645 --> 01:01:55.225
Sir.

685
01:01:55.224 --> 01:01:56.854
Yes?

686
01:01:56.852 --> 01:02:02.112
I think I heard him say something
about an elliptical machine, sir.


687
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:24.340
You think they're gonna give him one?

688
01:02:24.336 --> 01:02:26.866
Why not?
It would be easier than this.


689
01:02:26.864 --> 01:02:29.994
Yeah, but it'd take
forever to get down here.


690
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:31.760
Are you kidding me?

691
01:02:31.759 --> 01:02:34.209
They'll just take ours.

692
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:53.750
Who's winning?

693
01:02:55.076 --> 01:02:58.486
You guys... that's who.

694
01:03:00.522 --> 01:03:02.452
I don't know about that.

695
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:04.570
You got your elliptical machine.

696
01:03:04.568 --> 01:03:06.228
Yeah.

697
01:03:08.154 --> 01:03:09.894
You gonna use it?

698
01:03:09.892 --> 01:03:11.722
No.

699
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:16.070
No one will use it.

700
01:03:16.506 --> 01:03:18.706
Why'd you demand it?

701
01:03:18.704 --> 01:03:22.704
I didn't demand this... mahmoud did.

702
01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.180
Why'd he demand it?

703
01:03:26.398 --> 01:03:28.818
I don't know.
Go ask Mahmoud.


704
01:03:28.814 --> 01:03:31.994
Maybe because he's an asshole?

705
01:03:46.488 --> 01:03:48.608
So what's the count today?

706
01:03:48.606 --> 01:03:52.906
Oh. I've only gotten to 12 kicks today.

707
01:03:52.902 --> 01:03:55.672
Do you know what I hear today?

708
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:59.840
Well, someone says sabir in "A" block...
they said he hit


709
01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.815
40 last week.

710
01:04:01.814 --> 01:04:04.184
- 40?
- Yeah. That's what they say.


711
01:04:04.182 --> 01:04:08.212
I don't know. I'm not so sure 'cause,
well, no one has seen this, you know...


712
01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:12.368
only the guards, and those guards...
they wouldn't say.


713
01:04:14.891 --> 01:04:16.791
You think you can beat 40?

714
01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.130
I don't know.

715
01:04:18.128 --> 01:04:21.878
I still think that
he's made this up, you know.


716
01:04:27.859 --> 01:04:31.769
I tell you what...
you beat 40, I'll vouch for you.


717
01:04:33.104 --> 01:04:34.404
Yeah?

718
01:04:34.402 --> 01:04:35.902
Yeah.

719
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.900
Okay.

720
01:04:39.978 --> 01:04:43.168
2...3...4...5...

721
01:04:43.164 --> 01:04:45.664
6...7...8...

722
01:04:49.978 --> 01:04:53.028
You're a long way away from 40.

723
01:04:53.025 --> 01:04:54.875
- What was that?
- 8.


724
01:04:54.872 --> 01:04:56.292
Are you sure?

725
01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:59.092
- Wasn't that 48?
- I'm sure.


726
01:04:59.089 --> 01:05:01.589
- You saw 48.
- I didn't.


727
01:05:01.586 --> 01:05:03.166
I mean, come on.

728
01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:05.885
Those guys... they don't
believe you, anyway.


729
01:05:05.882 --> 01:05:08.632
Not gonna lie for you.

730
01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:20.942
You know, compliant detainees get
to play on a real field together?


731
01:05:20.938 --> 01:05:23.638
Uh-huh. They are lucky.

732
01:05:25.974 --> 01:05:28.854
If you stop acting up,
they'll transfer you.


733
01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:31.930
- You know that, right?
- Mm-hmm.


734
01:05:36.764 --> 01:05:39.624
And you don't care?

735
01:05:41.428 --> 01:05:44.698
It's those guys who don't care, blondie.

736
01:05:44.696 --> 01:05:49.656
You know, they don't care about anything,
just the things that make their life easier.


737
01:05:49.651 --> 01:05:56.011
You guys always say, "follow these rules...
we will let you watch TV," huh?


738
01:05:56.005 --> 01:05:59.655
But if I follow your
rules, what does it means?


739
01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:03.271
It means that I'm agreeing that you
have the right to give me rules, huh?


740
01:06:03.268 --> 01:06:04.958
Well, you don't.

741
01:06:04.956 --> 01:06:07.676
You don't have the
right to give me rules.

742
01:06:07.944 --> 01:06:09.434
So, me...

743
01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:12.922
I never agree to follow your rules...

744
01:06:12.918 --> 01:06:14.958
Never.

745
01:06:16.666 --> 01:06:19.416
You know, maybe you think
I'm stupid for this.


746
01:06:19.412 --> 01:06:23.462
- No, you're not stupid.
- No. I mean, maybe you're right, but...


747
01:06:30.042 --> 01:06:33.002
You're definitely not stupid.

748
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.810
You went to university.

749
01:06:36.996 --> 01:06:39.616
You're making fun of me, huh?

750
01:06:39.614 --> 01:06:42.954
Yeah, you're making fun...
you're laughing at me, huh?


751
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:46.790
Come on. Look at you.
You're laughing at me, huh?


752
01:06:56.547 --> 01:06:59.537
- What's that about?
- Nothing.


753
01:07:00.544 --> 01:07:04.054
They don't like you talking to me, huh?

754
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.660
Private...

755
01:07:07.336 --> 01:07:09.426
Get over here.

756
01:07:09.424 --> 01:07:12.364
Neither do they, huh?

757
01:07:15.868 --> 01:07:18.208
Yes, Corporal?

758
01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:22.236
What were you just talking
about over there?


759
01:07:22.422 --> 01:07:23.812
With Ali?

760
01:07:23.812 --> 01:07:27.532
No, with detainee 471.

761
01:07:28.996 --> 01:07:31.226
- Nothing.
- Uh-huh. All right.


762
01:07:31.224 --> 01:07:35.824
Well, if you ain't talking about nothing,
then you don't need to be talking, right?


763
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.300
Hey!

764
01:07:37.618 --> 01:07:41.478
Hey, I did 20 kicks!
Hey! I did 20 kicks!


765
01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:45.344
Did you see that, blondie?
I swear I did 20!


766
01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.000
I swear I did!

767
01:07:48.408 --> 01:07:51.048
I'm gonna need your help
on the showers today.


768
01:07:51.046 --> 01:07:52.866
The showers?

769
01:07:52.864 --> 01:07:56.674
I know you don't want to, but
all my extra men are dealing


770
01:07:56.670 --> 01:08:01.110
with some dickhead in delta pod that
decided to cover his entire cell in poop.


771
01:08:01.106 --> 01:08:03.386
I can't work showers.
They won't even look me in the eye.


772
01:08:03.384 --> 01:08:06.184
- They think they're gonna shower?
- Well, that's their problem.


773
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:09.720
I mean, at least it'll speed things up.

774
01:08:10.736 --> 01:08:15.136
- S.O.P. Clearly states we are not...
- I know what S.O.P. Says.


775
01:08:16.052 --> 01:08:18.802
What's the matter?
Can't handle it?


776
01:08:18.798 --> 01:08:21.378
You want me to get
one of my other guys,

777
01:08:21.376 --> 01:08:25.946
pull him away from doing whatever
the hell he's doing, so he can do it for you?


778
01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.820
No.

779
01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:46.066
Forget her.
Get your ass in there.


780
01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.600
Let's go, skippy.

781
01:08:50.598 --> 01:08:53.238
Get undressed.
Clock's ticking.


782
01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.880
Get your pants off.

783
01:09:12.568 --> 01:09:14.388
And shorts off.

784
01:09:14.736 --> 01:09:16.396
Come on.

785
01:09:16.394 --> 01:09:19.524
Get your fucking shorts off.

786
01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.180
Get your fucking shorts off,

787
01:09:22.178 --> 01:09:25.998
or I'll call in an Irf and we'll get them
to take them off for you.


788
01:09:25.994 --> 01:09:28.634
Get them off.

789
01:09:49.103 --> 01:09:52.603
You guarding the fence,
or you guarding him?


790
01:09:53.908 --> 01:09:57.138
This is completely out of line.

791
01:09:57.136 --> 01:09:58.836
Let me ask you something...

792
01:09:58.834 --> 01:10:01.574
are you a soldier,
or are you a female soldier?


793
01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.212
'Cause I don't have these kind
of problems with soldiers.


794
01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:07.478
You got to watch him.
That's your job.


795
01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.120
Look at him.

796
01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.590
Hey, Cole, I thought that was you.

797
01:10:46.588 --> 01:10:48.278
What are you doing back here?

798
01:10:48.276 --> 01:10:51.236
- Drinking.
- No shit.


799
01:10:52.483 --> 01:10:55.863
What's wrong?
You had a bad day or something?


800
01:10:56.289 --> 01:10:59.069
Not particularly.

801
01:10:59.496 --> 01:11:02.576
Not as bad as yours, I hear.

802
01:11:03.172 --> 01:11:05.832
What do you mean?

803
01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:12.038
I heard some detainee
just covered his cell on feces.


804
01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:14.104
Probably wasn't fun.

805
01:11:14.102 --> 01:11:15.562
When... today?

806
01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.310
On delta pod?

807
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:19.210
No, it was just pretty quiet all day.

808
01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.728
Yeah.

809
01:11:23.853 --> 01:11:25.323
Must have been another pod.

810
01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:27.692
No, nothing like that
happened on any of the pods.


811
01:11:27.689 --> 01:11:30.079
If it did, I would've saw it.

812
01:11:31.526 --> 01:11:33.486
Come in, boys! 
It's shot time!

813
01:11:33.484 --> 01:11:36.584
That's what I'm talking about!
Oh, hey.


814
01:11:39.238 --> 01:11:40.818
What do you want?

815
01:11:40.816 --> 01:11:43.506
Jackie Chan got one.

816
01:12:02.046 --> 01:12:04.046
Shh! Shh!

817
01:12:05.583 --> 01:12:09.963
I'm not following you here.

818
01:13:03.348 --> 01:13:06.878
Private first class Cole
reporting as ordered, sir.


819
01:13:06.874 --> 01:13:09.384
At ease.

820
01:13:09.382 --> 01:13:12.752
Have a seat, private.

821
01:13:20.881 --> 01:13:22.831
Candy?

822
01:13:25.088 --> 01:13:27.998
No, thank you, sir.

823
01:13:30.652 --> 01:13:35.482
I've read your report.
I've also spoken to corporal ransdell.


824
01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:47.898
In your report, you say that you were...

825
01:13:47.896 --> 01:13:51.926
...escorting a detainee to the showers
after rec... is that correct?


826
01:13:51.922 --> 01:13:53.442
Affirmative.

827
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.440
And you filed the report because
this was uncomfortable.


828
01:13:57.686 --> 01:14:02.416
Well... No, I-it made him uncomfortable.

829
01:14:03.202 --> 01:14:06.222
- Who?
- The detainee.


830
01:14:07.018 --> 01:14:13.478
So you filed against a fellow soldier
because the detainee was uncomfortable?


831
01:14:14.351 --> 01:14:18.721
It was not the proper
way to treat him, sir.


832
01:14:18.716 --> 01:14:22.146
Did the detainee take a shower?

833
01:14:22.144 --> 01:14:23.834
Yes, sir.

834
01:14:23.832 --> 01:14:27.482
Sounds like he wasn't that
uncomfortable with it, then.


835
01:14:29.376 --> 01:14:32.666
It was a blatant violation of
standard operating procedure,


836
01:14:32.664 --> 01:14:34.874
which is why I filed the report.

837
01:14:34.872 --> 01:14:37.722
Since you knew what was
happening was against S.O.P.,


838
01:14:37.718 --> 01:14:40.658
what exactly were you doing there?

839
01:14:40.656 --> 01:14:43.626
I was ordered to be there, sir.

840
01:14:43.622 --> 01:14:47.672
Corporal ransdell gave you a direct order?

841
01:14:47.668 --> 01:14:50.608
He had lied about being shorthanded.

842
01:14:50.606 --> 01:14:53.386
Did he order you, or
did he lie to you?

843
01:14:53.384 --> 01:14:54.384
Sir...

844
01:14:54.382 --> 01:14:57.432
'Cause it seems to me there'd be no point
to lie to you if he simply ordered you.


845
01:14:57.430 --> 01:15:01.050
- He... he...
- And there's nothing going on?


846
01:15:03.214 --> 01:15:07.404
You don't have a personal
relationship with him,


847
01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.080
nothing going on outside the wire?

848
01:15:13.054 --> 01:15:14.904
No, sir.

849
01:15:15.292 --> 01:15:18.692
Is that what he told you?

850
01:15:22.106 --> 01:15:25.376
4-7-1, the detainee...

851
01:15:25.372 --> 01:15:28.252
you two are friends.

852
01:15:29.939 --> 01:15:31.739
No, sir.

853
01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:34.836
You're not friendly with him?

854
01:15:35.594 --> 01:15:39.624
- No, sir.
- You don't talk to him?


855
01:15:41.388 --> 01:15:43.178
We have spoken.

856
01:15:43.176 --> 01:15:46.686
I am...Not...

857
01:15:47.932 --> 01:15:50.082
I...

858
01:15:51.328 --> 01:15:54.458
- Like I said in my report...
- I've read your report.


859
01:15:54.456 --> 01:15:56.226
I know what it says.

860
01:15:56.224 --> 01:15:58.534
I also know what corporal
ransdell says about it.


861
01:15:58.531 --> 01:16:03.541
But what I don't know and will probably
never know is what is really going on here.


862
01:16:07.483 --> 01:16:10.983
Do you like it here, son?

863
01:16:11.748 --> 01:16:13.078
Sir?

864
01:16:13.078 --> 01:16:15.038
Do you like it here...

865
01:16:15.036 --> 01:16:17.786
In Guantanamo bay?

866
01:16:20.311 --> 01:16:21.891
Yes, sir.

867
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:23.520
It's fine.

868
01:16:23.518 --> 01:16:25.308
I hate it.

869
01:16:25.906 --> 01:16:29.476
This ain't the kind of post
a guy makes his stars on.


870
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:32.951
Nobody gives you a medal
when you do it right...


871
01:16:32.949 --> 01:16:36.619
they just give you a demotion
when you do it wrong.


872
01:16:36.615 --> 01:16:43.885
My granddad... he flew 25 missions over
Germany, blew up a dozen Nazi installments.


873
01:16:43.878 --> 01:16:46.108
What do we get?

874
01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:50.326
We get to babysit
a bunch of sheep farmers.

875
01:16:50.912 --> 01:16:54.592
Like I said, I hate it
here, and, yet, here I am.


876
01:16:54.588 --> 01:16:57.848
And do you know why?

877
01:16:57.846 --> 01:17:03.396
I'm here because my commanding
officer told me to come here.


878
01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:09.486
Yes, sir.

879
01:17:11.272 --> 01:17:16.822
The review board will have, uh,
a hearing for both of you next month.


880
01:17:18.236 --> 01:17:21.716
- I didn't do...
- You're dismissed.


881
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.090
Yes, sir.

882
01:17:26.088 --> 01:17:28.428
Good morning, sir.

883
01:17:30.954 --> 01:17:33.324
- Hey.
- Hey.


884
01:17:37.128 --> 01:17:40.038
How's your Enchilada?

885
01:17:40.494 --> 01:17:43.384
It's about as good as it looks.

886
01:17:43.382 --> 01:17:45.392
I should have went with
the chicken fingers.


887
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:47.890
Hard to mess those up, right?

888
01:17:53.812 --> 01:17:57.082
Hear about what happened on delta pod?

889
01:17:58.597 --> 01:18:01.237
What?
Another cocktail?


890
01:18:01.235 --> 01:18:05.505
No. A dude tried to hang
himself last night.


891
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.380
How?

892
01:18:07.379 --> 01:18:10.779
It's not even possible.
We watch these guys 24-7.


893
01:18:10.776 --> 01:18:13.336
No, not a detainee.

894
01:18:13.334 --> 01:18:17.114
It was a... it was a guard.

895
01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:23.287
The dude tied himself off to a
ceiling fan and... get this...


896
01:18:23.284 --> 01:18:25.484
the piece of shit
pulled out of the wall.

897
01:18:25.482 --> 01:18:27.902
Can you believe that shit?

898
01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:31.790
The dude's life got saved
by shitty army contractors.


899
01:18:31.786 --> 01:18:34.026
It's funny, right?

900
01:18:34.024 --> 01:18:36.014
He's lucky.

901
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:38.690
It's crazy though, right...

902
01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:40.690
that he tried to kill himself?

903
01:18:40.688 --> 01:18:42.798
I mean, I get it.
It's a tough mission, you know.


904
01:18:42.795 --> 01:18:44.435
But what the fuck, man?

905
01:18:44.434 --> 01:18:47.204
It's our fucking job.
You got to get over it, you know?


906
01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.210
Yeah.

907
01:18:51.497 --> 01:18:55.277
I know. It's got to be hard
for some people, though.


908
01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:57.423
It's...

909
01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:03.110
It's not as black and white
as they said it was gonna be.


910
01:19:03.106 --> 01:19:06.176
What's that mean?

911
01:19:06.172 --> 01:19:09.902
I don't know what he was expecting,
but I'm sure it wasn't this.


912
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.870
Come on, though.
It's not as bad as that.


913
01:19:12.866 --> 01:19:15.096
A lot of these
guys aren't even that tough.

914
01:19:15.094 --> 01:19:16.724
Exactly.

915
01:19:16.723 --> 01:19:18.953
Makes you feel fucking guilty.
It's like...


916
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:21.210
Guilty? Come... what the fuck
you got to feel guilty for?


917
01:19:21.208 --> 01:19:23.138
No, man.
Hell, you shouldn't feel guilty about shit.


918
01:19:23.137 --> 01:19:27.577
These motherfuckers did 9/11,
and now they're in jail... end of story.


919
01:19:27.572 --> 01:19:31.542
The motherfuckers that did 9/11 died there.

920
01:19:33.117 --> 01:19:35.397
You know what your problem is?

921
01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:37.686
You've been talking too much
to the fucking translators.


922
01:19:37.682 --> 01:19:41.242
They've gotten all in your head, and
you've forgotten how lucky you really are.


923
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.360
We could be in Iraq right now.

924
01:19:43.358 --> 01:19:45.048
You realize that?

925
01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:49.156
I mean, you'd rather be dodging
cocktails than bullets, right?


926
01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:53.310
No.

927
01:19:54.098 --> 01:19:56.518
Whatever.

928
01:19:56.516 --> 01:19:58.856
10 minutes, faggots.

929
01:19:58.852 --> 01:20:01.742
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

930
01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:10.904
Hey...You smoke now?

931
01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.050
Yeah.

932
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:25.060
What are you gonna do, Cole?

933
01:20:25.058 --> 01:20:27.588
Tell on it?

934
01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:29.270
Based on the detainees' preferences...

935
01:22:53.018 --> 01:22:54.568
Yo.

936
01:22:56.274 --> 01:22:59.054
- What's up?
- Here you go.


937
01:22:59.052 --> 01:23:01.222
You've been transferred.

938
01:23:01.219 --> 01:23:04.129
What? Where?

939
01:23:07.443 --> 01:23:08.973
Night shift.

940
01:23:08.972 --> 01:23:10.032
Yeah.

941
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:13.241
Just, uh, skip tomorrow.
Rotate in on the next.


942
01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:16.118
Your new O.I.C. Will come get you.
It's all there.


943
01:23:16.116 --> 01:23:17.476
Why?

944
01:23:17.474 --> 01:23:19.004
Why?

945
01:23:19.002 --> 01:23:22.672
Shit, Cole. You know ain't
no why in the army.


946
01:23:49.184 --> 01:23:50.774
Hey. Hey.

947
01:23:50.772 --> 01:23:53.412
Is that clock right?

948
01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.560
Yeah.

949
01:23:56.706 --> 01:24:00.646
So...W-where is blondie?

950
01:24:01.272 --> 01:24:02.842
Huh?

951
01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.780
Detainee 1-0-8 was heard
singing a song in Arabic


952
01:24:26.778 --> 01:24:29.788
that had the English words
"bin laden" in it.


953
01:24:29.784 --> 01:24:35.064
At 1700 hours, detainee 9-1 complained
that his chow smelled rotten.


954
01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:38.810
He was given another meal,
which he said tasted bad.


955
01:24:38.806 --> 01:24:43.706
At 1900, detainee 2-3-5
was given a water bottle.


956
01:24:43.702 --> 01:24:45.982
He drank it, asked for another,

957
01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:49.870
and proceeded to drink six more
bottles in the span of five minutes.


958
01:24:49.866 --> 01:24:53.486
He then complained of feeling bad.

959
01:24:53.482 --> 01:24:58.632
We had 2-5 moves scheduled,

960
01:24:59.626 --> 01:25:02.216
Atten-hut!

961
01:25:02.214 --> 01:25:03.684
Honor bound.

962
01:25:03.683 --> 01:25:05.833
To defend freedom.

963
01:25:40.378 --> 01:25:42.798
Blondie?

964
01:25:43.854 --> 01:25:46.274
Blondie?

965
01:25:47.062 --> 01:25:49.652
It is you.

966
01:25:51.497 --> 01:25:54.427
Hey, don't... don't get up.
Go back to sleep.


967
01:25:54.424 --> 01:25:57.064
No. No. No. I..I...I...

968
01:25:57.062 --> 01:25:58.912
I can never sleep well...

969
01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:00.740
you know, here, anyway.

970
01:26:00.738 --> 01:26:03.998
I didn't... I didn't know they
kept the lights on all night.


971
01:26:03.995 --> 01:26:06.475
All day and all night.

972
01:26:06.473 --> 01:26:09.243
How is it that you're here?

973
01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.970
I mean, uh, you're a night guard.

974
01:26:14.576 --> 01:26:17.996
Oh. Um, I'm sorry.

975
01:26:17.992 --> 01:26:20.632
You cannot say. I
-It's okay.

976
01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:24.420
No. Actually, uh...

977
01:26:26.344 --> 01:26:28.844
...I snitched on someone.

978
01:26:28.842 --> 01:26:31.372
What... what... what is it... snitch?

979
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:34.250
It's like golden snitch and...

980
01:26:34.526 --> 01:26:35.886
No.

981
01:26:35.885 --> 01:26:40.755
Um, to snitch on someone is,

982
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:47.390
uh...It's to tell... like, if someone
does something wrong, you turn them in.


983
01:26:50.262 --> 01:26:54.042
Who... who did you snitch on?

984
01:26:57.085 --> 01:26:59.505
I can't say.

985
01:26:59.502 --> 01:27:02.192
It's moptop, huh?

986
01:27:03.659 --> 01:27:07.039
What... what did he do to you?

987
01:27:09.783 --> 01:27:14.133
You should get some sleep.
See you later.


988
01:27:35.598 --> 01:27:38.758
I'm not gonna tell you what he did.

989
01:27:38.755 --> 01:27:40.575
Okay.

990
01:27:42.752 --> 01:27:47.292
So, tell me this one...
how did you end up here?


991
01:27:48.786 --> 01:27:51.266
I told you... they reassigned me.

992
01:27:51.263 --> 01:27:52.643
No, no.

993
01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:56.402
How did you end
up here in this place?

994
01:28:00.744 --> 01:28:03.494
How did you end up here?

995
01:28:03.492 --> 01:28:05.392
Me?

996
01:28:06.968 --> 01:28:10.458
How did I end up here?

997
01:28:13.982 --> 01:28:21.462
I could tell you that I was not
with Al-Qaeda or a terrorist or...


998
01:28:21.454 --> 01:28:23.964
you wouldn't believe me, anyway.

999
01:28:23.962 --> 01:28:27.332
Nobody believes me here.

1000
01:28:32.604 --> 01:28:36.464
So you're from Germany?

1001
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:38.150
Yeah.

1002
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:40.249
You remember.

1003
01:28:40.246 --> 01:28:42.036
Yeah.

1004
01:28:42.034 --> 01:28:44.594
Yeah. Yeah.

1005
01:28:44.892 --> 01:28:46.772
From Germany, yeah.

1006
01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:50.630
Actually, I was, you know, from Bremen.

1007
01:28:50.627 --> 01:28:52.617
Do you know the city... Bremen?

1008
01:28:52.614 --> 01:28:54.464
Bremen?

1009
01:28:54.782 --> 01:28:58.212
- You don't know?
- No. I can't even say it.


1010
01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:01.560
<i>Huh? Sprechen Sie Deutsch?</i>

1011
01:29:01.556 --> 01:29:04.516
<i>- No speakDeutsch?
- Mm, Dutch?</i>


1012
01:29:04.514 --> 01:29:06.394
<i>- What?
- Nein.</i>


1013
01:29:06.392 --> 01:29:08.022
Um, no.

1014
01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:11.890
Have you been in Germany before?

1015
01:29:12.866 --> 01:29:13.946
No?

1016
01:29:13.944 --> 01:29:15.444
- No.
- No.


1017
01:29:15.444 --> 01:29:19.744
No. I'd like to... plan to.

1018
01:29:19.739 --> 01:29:23.599
So, tell me... where have you been?

1019
01:29:27.022 --> 01:29:31.132
I mean, you're...
you're probably gonna laugh.


1020
01:29:31.128 --> 01:29:33.358
Me? Laugh? No.

1021
01:29:33.356 --> 01:29:34.906
At you?

1022
01:29:34.905 --> 01:29:37.925
Uh, I
-I never laugh at you.

1023
01:29:41.159 --> 01:29:45.949
This is my first time out of the country...
I mean, it's pretty lame, right?


1024
01:29:45.944 --> 01:29:47.604
No.

1025
01:29:47.603 --> 01:29:49.203
No, it's not.

1026
01:29:49.202 --> 01:29:52.172
It's... you're... you're young.

1027
01:29:52.168 --> 01:29:56.168
You're very young, and you're...
you're a beginner, huh?


1028
01:29:56.164 --> 01:29:58.174
Yeah.

1029
01:29:59.152 --> 01:30:03.182
There are more people on this
base than in my hometown.


1030
01:30:03.178 --> 01:30:04.668
Small, huh?

1031
01:30:04.666 --> 01:30:08.536
Yeah, tiny... gets smaller every day.

1032
01:30:08.532 --> 01:30:12.532
And is this the
reason that you came here?

1033
01:30:12.529 --> 01:30:15.189
Part of it, yeah.

1034
01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:18.726
What is the other part?

1035
01:30:19.892 --> 01:30:22.502
A lot of reasons.
Um...


1036
01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:33.492
I wanted to do something.

1037
01:30:33.488 --> 01:30:36.148
You know, I...

1038
01:30:36.146 --> 01:30:40.306
I wanted to do something important.

1039
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:45.990
Yeah.

1040
01:30:50.473 --> 01:30:53.333
I understand.

1041
01:31:47.988 --> 01:31:49.648
Hey.

1042
01:31:51.494 --> 01:31:53.914
Thank you.

1043
01:31:54.892 --> 01:31:57.372
It's hard making the switch, huh?

1044
01:31:57.369 --> 01:31:58.999
Yeah, it's all right.

1045
01:31:58.998 --> 01:32:01.398
It takes a few days.

1046
01:32:01.834 --> 01:32:07.354
Of course, uh, you won't be a night owl for...
for too long, right?


1047
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:09.600
I guess not.

1048
01:32:09.597 --> 01:32:11.557
Or...

1049
01:32:12.754 --> 01:32:15.124
I hated the day shift...

1050
01:32:15.122 --> 01:32:18.872
bunch of detainees chatting your ear off.

1051
01:32:20.098 --> 01:32:23.248
I'd hate that.

1052
01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:32.060
Thanks for the coffee.

1053
01:32:43.226 --> 01:32:47.366
Hey. Are you still awake?

1054
01:32:50.948 --> 01:32:54.188
What day is today?

1055
01:32:54.185 --> 01:32:56.495
Wednesday.

1056
01:32:56.493 --> 01:33:00.323
No, what date is today?

1057
01:33:00.319 --> 01:33:03.999
Um, July 14th.

1058
01:33:07.012 --> 01:33:10.902
So you're leaving next month?

1059
01:33:11.818 --> 01:33:13.778
Yeah.

1060
01:33:13.776 --> 01:33:16.176
How'd you know that?

1061
01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:21.344
They always change the guards in August.

1062
01:33:29.492 --> 01:33:35.012
So, when... when you leave,
will you sign up again here?


1063
01:33:35.006 --> 01:33:40.636
Like, you know, there are guards
here that have been for many years.


1064
01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.120
No, I don't think so.

1065
01:33:54.068 --> 01:33:59.398
So you want to go to your home, your...
your small town?


1066
01:33:59.394 --> 01:34:01.674
No.

1067
01:34:05.757 --> 01:34:09.777
What do you want to do, then?

1068
01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:14.750
I don't know yet.

1069
01:34:14.748 --> 01:34:17.828
Travel, maybe.

1070
01:34:17.826 --> 01:34:20.706
Go to Bremen.

1071
01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.600
I don't like this month.

1072
01:34:29.614 --> 01:34:33.564
Always these new guards...

1073
01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.210
Treating us like very bad guys.

1074
01:34:41.632 --> 01:34:45.522
They'll learn...Like I did.

1075
01:34:50.574 --> 01:34:53.564
What did you learn?

1076
01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.986
Huh?

1077
01:35:01.424 --> 01:35:03.464
Tell me.

1078
01:35:06.319 --> 01:35:10.779
You must learn something, huh,
when I throw that shit on you...


1079
01:35:10.776 --> 01:35:13.766
you learned something, huh?

1080
01:35:13.762 --> 01:35:17.812
Or when we're trying to
kill ourselves here,


1081
01:35:17.808 --> 01:35:21.408
with hunger strike, you learned something..
Huh? You said.


1082
01:35:21.405 --> 01:35:23.195
So tell me... what is that?

1083
01:35:23.194 --> 01:35:26.324
I want to know.
What did you learn?


1084
01:35:31.835 --> 01:35:36.135
Only you think you know,
but you know nothing.


1085
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:40.320
You know nothing about me.

1086
01:35:42.146 --> 01:35:44.996
You and me...

1087
01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:50.920
We are at war.

1088
01:35:53.425 --> 01:35:56.225
I don't see it like that.

1089
01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:00.600
Then you see nothing.

1090
01:37:07.954 --> 01:37:09.914
What is that?

1091
01:37:09.952 --> 01:37:11.822
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1092
01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:15.240
If... if you call on your radio,
you're not going to make it.


1093
01:37:16.546 --> 01:37:18.996
You're not going to make it.

1094
01:37:18.993 --> 01:37:21.333
Bring it down.

1095
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:24.590
Bring it down.

1096
01:37:25.217 --> 01:37:27.937
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1097
01:37:29.454 --> 01:37:31.144
Okay.

1098
01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.760
Just don't do anything crazy, okay?

1099
01:37:34.758 --> 01:37:36.448
You think I'm crazy?

1100
01:37:36.446 --> 01:37:41.396
No. No, I said just don't...
don't do anything crazy.


1101
01:37:41.392 --> 01:37:43.102
Is this crazy to you?

1102
01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.820
If you was me, you wouldn't do this?

1103
01:37:44.818 --> 01:37:47.998
Give me one reason why... one.

1104
01:37:49.004 --> 01:37:54.034
Maybe to try to not... not die in this...
this fucking shithole.


1105
01:37:54.898 --> 01:37:58.738
I don't like to die in this shithole!

1106
01:37:58.736 --> 01:38:02.846
But one way or another,
this is the place I will die.


1107
01:38:02.841 --> 01:38:05.451
Look, you don't know that.

1108
01:38:05.449 --> 01:38:08.659
You can't know that.

1109
01:38:09.275 --> 01:38:12.685
Ali, things can change.

1110
01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.780
Things... things can always change.

1111
01:38:15.779 --> 01:38:19.909
You... you can't just, uh...
you can't just fucking give up.


1112
01:38:19.906 --> 01:38:22.956
- You got to...
- Give up, blondie... what is "give up"?


1113
01:38:22.952 --> 01:38:26.382
Three years ago, they took
me to these interrogations.


1114
01:38:26.378 --> 01:38:27.978
And one of your guys here,

1115
01:38:27.977 --> 01:38:32.147
one of those guys who don't wear uniform...
he told me that I'm innocent.


1116
01:38:32.144 --> 01:38:36.034
He told me that he knows I'm innocent,
but I still cannot go home...


1117
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:38.420
Because there's no country, no city,

1118
01:38:38.418 --> 01:38:42.878
no fucking person in this planet
will take me because I've been here.


1119
01:38:43.692 --> 01:38:45.892
I have no place to go, blondie.

1120
01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:49.950
This is the only thing
that can change something.


1121
01:38:57.230 --> 01:38:59.050
Everything okay?

1122
01:39:01.196 --> 01:39:02.206
Yeah.

1123
01:39:02.205 --> 01:39:04.685
Yeah, everything's fine. Um.

1124
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.030
My... my radio's...
it's...it's on the Fritz.


1125
01:39:09.028 --> 01:39:10.738
Can you get me another one?

1126
01:39:10.736 --> 01:39:13.076
Uh, yeah.

1127
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:33.440
Blondie, you... you are a good guy.

1128
01:39:34.604 --> 01:39:37.654
Yeah, thanks.

1129
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:41.210
Am I a bad guy
or a good guy to you?

1130
01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:45.398
Ali...It doesn't matter right now.

1131
01:39:45.394 --> 01:39:49.044
It's the only time it matters.

1132
01:39:50.448 --> 01:39:53.308
So you're gonna just...

1133
01:39:54.366 --> 01:39:56.356
you're gonna be a martyr?
Is that what you think you're...


1134
01:39:56.353 --> 01:39:57.953
you think you're gonna go to heaven?

1135
01:39:57.952 --> 01:40:00.482
That's what you want to do?

1136
01:40:02.058 --> 01:40:05.788
I don't believe in this anymore.

1137
01:40:05.784 --> 01:40:08.554
Well, then, why are you doing this?

1138
01:40:08.552 --> 01:40:10.432
Look at me.

1139
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:14.890
You're asking me why
do I want to die,

1140
01:40:14.886 --> 01:40:18.676
but you don't see
that I'm not even living.

1141
01:40:18.672 --> 01:40:21.032
You guys control everything.

1142
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:25.900
You tell us what to eat,
when to sleep.


1143
01:40:25.896 --> 01:40:31.236
Even when we don't want to eat,
you tell me we must.


1144
01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:36.340
It is your life... it is not ours.

1145
01:40:39.812 --> 01:40:44.522
I don't expect you to understand that.

1146
01:40:45.876 --> 01:40:49.256
I
-I like you.

1147
01:40:50.852 --> 01:40:52.132
I do.

1148
01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:57.380
But... but you'll never understand this.

1149
01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:06.698
It's Amy.

1150
01:41:09.254 --> 01:41:12.624
You keep calling me "blondie," but...

1151
01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:17.410
My name's Amy Cole
from Moore haven, Florida.


1152
01:41:20.234 --> 01:41:22.604
And I like you, Ali.

1153
01:41:22.602 --> 01:41:25.192
I really do.

1154
01:41:41.164 --> 01:41:43.914
Ah, fuck!
Hey, hey!


1155
01:41:48.048 --> 01:41:51.748
Is there a... is
there a zoo in Bremen?

1156
01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.960
What?

1157
01:41:59.186 --> 01:42:03.246
When I was a kid, I went
to the zoo with my dad.


1158
01:42:04.922 --> 01:42:08.602
It was just outside where
we lived and, uh...


1159
01:42:08.598 --> 01:42:14.878
It's really small, one of those zoos where
they keep the animals locked up in these...


1160
01:42:14.872 --> 01:42:17.702
these tiny, little cages,
these tiny, little,


1161
01:42:17.699 --> 01:42:23.059
like, concrete boxes with
tires in them or something.


1162
01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.930
I was really excited about going.

1163
01:42:28.928 --> 01:42:32.628
I really wanted to see
something outside my town.


1164
01:42:32.624 --> 01:42:34.994
I wanted to be...

1165
01:42:34.992 --> 01:42:39.482
I wanted to be so close to
something so wild and...


1166
01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:45.514
It just wasn't okay.

1167
01:42:45.512 --> 01:42:48.742
I didn't... I didn't like it.

1168
01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:53.100
And my dad kept trying to fucking
tell me that it was okay, that...


1169
01:42:53.095 --> 01:42:58.095
that this lion could never
go back home because...


1170
01:42:58.090 --> 01:43:00.620
because he wouldn't be able
to survive in the wild,


1171
01:43:00.618 --> 01:43:02.198
having been locked up for so long.

1172
01:43:02.197 --> 01:43:07.507
Okay. You're trying to tell me that the
zoo people... they are not guilty.


1173
01:43:07.502 --> 01:43:10.492
They have no choice.

1174
01:43:12.906 --> 01:43:14.816
No.

1175
01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:22.970
I thought they had a choice.

1176
01:43:23.976 --> 01:43:28.246
If they had the choice,
they should've given it to him.


1177
01:43:29.490 --> 01:43:33.460
They should have let the lion choose.

1178
01:47:58.375 --> 01:48:01.185
You're the new guy, huh?

1179
01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.390
Tell me... how do you like it here?

1180
01:48:05.388 --> 01:48:08.768
Do you want a book or not?

1181
01:48:08.764 --> 01:48:11.894
Hold on your horses, big ear.

1182
01:48:11.892 --> 01:48:15.152
No one here goes anywhere.

1183
01:48:15.148 --> 01:48:17.408
At least, I'm...

1184
01:48:17.407 --> 01:48:22.027
what... what is that book there,
the big one?


1185
01:48:22.792 --> 01:48:25.342
No. No, the b... the big one.

1186
01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:28.230
The... the big yellow book!

1187
01:48:28.226 --> 01:48:31.376
The big... the yellow big book!

1188
01:48:31.374 --> 01:48:34.864
Yes, that... give it to me.

1189
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:37.610
Yeah, give that book.
