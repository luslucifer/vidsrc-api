00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.970
<i>Baby cakes.</i>

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.800
<i>Talk to the angels.</i>

<i>It's one o'clock in the morning
and you're wide awake.</i>

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.450
<i>I love you. 
Bless you.</i>

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.920
<i>What do you have to say?</i>

7
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.620
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.340
<i>There's the monkey.</i>

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.540

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.150
<i>Yeah.</i>

11
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.110
<i>You're going to fast.</i>

12
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.680
<i>Let me see.</i>

13
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.640
<i>Let me see you swim.</i>

14
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.660
<i>Are you sweeping?</i>

15
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.000
<i>Say "I love you."</i>

16
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.770
Hey, sorry. I'm here alone.

17
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.750
- Would you like coffee?
- That'd be great.


18
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.250
- I'd like a hot tea.
- Okay.


19
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.180
This is so really bad.

20
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.410
It's fine.

21
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.950
This is the grossest place
I've ever seen in my life.


22
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.620
- It's fine.
- It's dirty.


23
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.060
It's local.

24
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.230
Mom, you said we
need to leave at 11.

25
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.420
I know, honey.
But Agnes isn't here yet.


26
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.170
We have to wait for her, sweetie.
I promise, we're gonna leave soon.


27
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.610
What is that like
the third time this week?

28
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.080
Next time it's going out of your paycheck.

29
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.560
Dale, where's my eggs over?

30
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.060
- Right here. You said up.
- I said easy.


31
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.020
- Give me 5 minutes.
- Well, I don't have 5 minutes.


32
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.660
- I got to get out of here.
- Jeez.


33
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.920
Okay, darling.

34
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.860
How about you colored it up
for your mother.


35
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.520
Okay.

36
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.820
I'll get it later.

37
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.220
- Crawfish Friday?
- Crawfish are good.


38
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.050
Just peel the tail back
and suck all the juice out the head.


39
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.900
- You suck juice out of the head?
- Yeah.


40
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.060
- What?
- Yeah, you just...


41
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.560
Okay. Here's a Belgian waffle and bacon.

42
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.020
Where the hash browns?

43
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.440
- You ordered bacon.
- I want it hash browns.


44
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.260
- Okay, I can get you that. No problem.
- No, he's fine.


45
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.920
- You ordered bacon.
- I want it hash browns.


46
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.070
Come on.

47
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.040
Tyler, eat. He's fine.

48
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.410
- Okay. Short stack with eggs.
- That's grandma's.


49
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.490
Mom, breakfast!

50
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.930
I can't eat now. 
I just took my pills.

51
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.750
You know what, you can have
grandma's potatoes.


52
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.930
I don't want hers.

53
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.130
Tyler, knock it off.

54
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.110
Okay, egg white omelet for you.

55
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.170
- Honey.
- Yes, ma'am?


56
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.530
You remind me of my daughter.

57
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.720
- Doesn't she look like Stephanie?
- Mom, I'm your daughter. Stephanie.


58
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.080
I'm your daughter.

59
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.410
- Tabasco?
- Okay, I'll get your Tabasco.


60
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.990
And your eggs will be right up, sir.

61
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.150
- Where's Agnes, Bill?
- Late?


62
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.980
- You trying to be funny?
- No, she's not answering her phone.


63
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.510
She might have overslept.
Can you do a double?


64
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.120
Can't, I got plans with my kid.
Call Alan.


65
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.190
Okay, hot coffee.

66
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.600
No, no, no. I would like
herbal tea, please.


67
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.520
Okay, I'll get you an herbal tea.

68
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.410
- Did you guys get menus?
- No, but we'd like some.


69
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.320
- Claire.
- What? Like we're supposed to guess?


70
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.900
- I'll be right back.
- Do your job.


71
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.560
Okay, I'm so sorry about that.
Here you go.


72
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.580
Silverware.

73
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.010
- Is everybody good here now?
- He's sulking.


74
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.570
I am not.

75
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.400
You know what, can you
just bring us side hash browns?

76
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.010
- Burnt on the edges.
- Burnt on the edges, coming up.


77
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.230
- We're good.
- Okay.


78
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.920
Still waiting on my eggs.

79
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.630
Right. Your eggs are coming right up.

80
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.150
Yeah, and can I actually get...

81
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.680
Can I switch to wheat toast
instead of white toast, is that alright?


82
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.570
Yeah, wheat instead of white.
Yep, got it.


83
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.190
- Thank you.
- Be right back.


84
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.750
New side of hash browns,
burnt on the edges.


85
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.180
Copy.

86
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.470
Miss!

87
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.250
Don't yell.

88
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.530
Miss!

89
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.440
- Please stop yelling.
- Shut up.


90
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.280
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

91
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.180
But Karla's kid sitting here waiting
for her to take him to the park.


92
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.450
Yeah, so you can come in?

93
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.220
So come in.

94
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.090
Here you go.

95
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.150
All the herbal tea you could
possibly want and two menus.


96
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.410
Is your oatmeal steel?

97
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.670
- What?
- Cut.


98
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.550
- Are your oats steel-cut?
- No, they're Quaker.


99
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.720
- Should I come back...
- No, no.


100
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.780
Oatmeal with...

101
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.200
I'll take with with reduced fat almond.

102
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.780
Oh, let me guess,
you only have wholemeal?


103
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.650
- From the Outer?
- No, from AMP.


104
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.630
Why don't I just apply it
directly to my thighs?


105
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.010
You could use some help.

106
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.850
Karla, go ahead and go.

107
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.300
- Really?
- Yeah. Dale found Agnes.


108
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.300
- She should be here in 15 minutes.
- Awesome.


109
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.380
- Who wants to go to the park?
- I am!


110
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.570
Let's go.

111
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.550
Mommy, your turn.

112
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.770
Is daddy coming to the fair?

113
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.190
No, sweetheart.
You're gonna see daddy next weekend.


114
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.110
And maybe you'll get to see Cheryl too.

115
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.090
Do you like Cheryl?

116
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.270
- I don't know.
- I think she's nice, Frankie.


117
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.060
And she's smart.
She's very smart.


118
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.920
- She's gonna be a doctor.
- Yeah, I know.


119
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.480
And I want you to really
make friends with her, okay?


120
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.910
Are you friends with her?

121
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.990
Yeah.

122
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.540
Yeah, I am.

123
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.320
She, daddy and I,
we all love somebody like crazy.


124
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.830
- Do you know who that is?
- Me!


125
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.600
You!

126
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.010
You.

127
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.380
We all love you.

128
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.150
Mommy, can I get ice cream?

129
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.180
You know what, how about
we check out all of our options first...


130
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.580
...and then maybe we'll come back.

131
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.690
- Okay? Come on.
- Okay.


132
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.500
Can I get my face painted?

133
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.560
How about we wait until
the line is a little shorter?


134
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.740
We'll come back, okay?

135
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.830
- Marco.
- Polo.


136
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.800
- How old your boy?
- Six.


137
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.520
He obviously likes to hide.

138
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.200
Marco.

139
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.490
Oh, Marco.

140
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.740
Oh, no.

141
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.670
Am I lost my little Frankie forever?

142
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.620
Where could he be?

143
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.940
There you are.

144
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.340
Come on, let's go see the show.

145
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.030
Can I get my face painted now?

146
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.070
Yeah, as soon as this song is over,
okay sweetheart?


147
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.340
Frankie, I'm gonna need
my phone for one second.


148
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.010
There you go. Let's switch.

149
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.240
Hello?

150
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.970
Yeah.

151
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.870
Can you hold on just one second?

152
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.610
Okay. Frankie, listen.

153
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.350
I'm gonna have to go over there
and take this phone call, okay?


154
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.240
It's really important.
Don't move, okay?


155
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.630
- Marco.
- Polo.


156
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.090
Don't move.

157
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.220
Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

158
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.860
He wants what?

159
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.850
Primary custody?

160
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.590
Well, he can't have that.
I mean, can he?


161
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.990
My batteries are gonna die, Mr. Jackson.
If it does, I'll call you back, okay?


162
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.730

- Polo.


163
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.330
I'm sorry. What?

164
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.860
I can't hear you. 
Say that again.

165
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.180
Yes, yes, I have a job.
I have a regular job. Yes.


166
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.360
Is that even gonna matter to the court?

167
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.010
Well, yeah, he's in real estate.

168
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.570
And his girlfriend is a pediatrician
and I'm a waitress.


169
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.830
So you do the math. Marco.

171
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.670
Let me tell you something, Mr. Jackson.

172
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.630
If he thinks that he's gonna take
my son away from me just because...

Oh, Marco!

181

- No, I can't find him.


189
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.590
- I don't know where he is.
- Okay.


190

What's his name, honey?
Is it Marco or Frankie?

Frankie!

196
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.070

- Yes, yes, call the police.


197
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.770
Marco!

198

Where is he?

223
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.360
Don't let me lose him.

224
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:17.950
Okay, God, I know I never pray to you
unless somebody is sick.


225
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.360
Or somebody's dying or in an airplane.

226
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.920
But, God, please don't let me lose him.

227
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.030
But if you get
me this one thing, God...

228

This one thing...

229
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:38.340
I will never ever ask you
for another thing as long as I live.


230
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.080
Let them be there, God.

231
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.640
Oh, thank God.
Oh, God, thank you.


232
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.370
Let him out!

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.250
<i>I don't know, because she said...</i>

322
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.670
Oh, God.

323
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.770
The police. Thank God, the police.

324
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.500
Come on!

325
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.390
Come on, come and get me!

326
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.030
Okay.

327
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.020
Come up here. Come up here.

328
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.150
They got my son! Help me!

329
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.810
- Pull over!
- No! Stop them!


330
00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.720
- They have my son in that car!
- Pull your car over now!


331
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.360
Pull them over!
They got my son in that car!


332
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.970
My son! Help me!

333
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.550
Pull that van over now!

334
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.310
This is your last warning! Pull over!

335
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.160
- Pull the car over now!
- Help me! They got my son!


336
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.250
No!

337
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.000
Oh, God!

338
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:13.680
Frankie!

339
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.060
I'm here, Frankie!

340
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.140
Oh, God.

341
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.500
What do you want?

342
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.660
No!

343
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.080
What do you people want?

344
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.180
Money?

345
00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:37.430
There's not a lot of cash in here.
But all my credit cards are in here too.


346
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.180
So you can get
all the money I have.

347
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.750
My PIN number is 1015.

348
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.990
Here.

349
00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.470
If you let him out of that car,
I will stop chasing you.


350
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.900
I'll go away.

351
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.300
All I want is my son.
That's all I care about.


352
00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.920
If the cops asked,
I haven't seen your face.


353
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.150
I don't know your license plate.

354
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.980
You can get away.

355
00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.530
If they asked me,
I won't know anything.


356
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.110
Let me tell you something.

357
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:39.380
As long as my
son is in that car...

358
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.320
...I will not stop.

359
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.640
Wherever you go...

360
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.420
...I will be right behind you.

361
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.140
No matter what.

362
00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:38.390
- Mommy!
- Frankie.


363
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.030
Frankie.

364
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:09.800
Karla, unlock the door.

365
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.760
What do you want?

366
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.970
You got $10,000?

367
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.280
Yeah.

368
00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.690
I'm gonna ride with you,
your son is gonna ride with him...


369
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.830
...and we're gonna go get that money.

370
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.390
Or you're gonna kill me.

371
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.850
That's what he wants.

372
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.180
What he wants me to do.

373
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.750
But I told him for $10,000,
we can make a new plan.


374
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:43.090
You want your boy and I want $10,000.

375
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.500
Karla, we have to get out of this field.
Unlock the door.


376
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.580
No.

377
00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.400
I'm trying to save your child.

378
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.690
Open the door before he changes his mind.

379
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:08.010
Come on.
You want him to kill your son?


380
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.210
Follow him.

381
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.920
Where do I go?

382
00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.020
Just keep going straight,
I'll tell you where to go.


383
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.640
After we get the money,
I'll give him a call...


384
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.880
...and you'll get your boy back.

385
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.550
Okay. Okay.

386
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.670
I know.

387
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.000
Go, go, go.

388
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.370
Okay.

389
00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:49.380
So now what's the plan?

390
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:55.010
You don't really even
have a plan, do you?

391
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.550
You have no idea
what to even do right now.


392
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.530
You need her...

393
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:01.680
You need her to tell you
what to do, don't you?


394
00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.990
Shit!

395
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.960
No!

396
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.080
No! Stop!

397
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.940
Frankie!

398
00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.750
No!

399
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:06.660
Oh, God! I need help!

400
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.130
Call 911!

401
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.960
- Why?
- My son has been kidnapped!


402
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.570
- What?
- Repeat after me!


403
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:18.040
80's Green Mustang GT!

404
00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.660
- Mustang GT.
- Call the police right now!


405
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.790
Call the police now!

406
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.820
Oh, no.

407
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:25.400
Please still here.

408
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.060
Oh my God.

409
00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:37.970
Frankie!

410
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.810
Oh, God.

411
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.690
What happened to the people
that were in this car?


412
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:53.760
They have me right
when I pulled him down.


413
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.140
He was driving like a crazy man.

414
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.280
- Okay, did you see a little boy?
- Yeah, they went down that way.


415
00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.880
Just wait, the police on their way.

416
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.810
That little boy is my son and
the man he was with kidnapped him.


417
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.080
- So tell the cops that.
- They'll be here in a minute.


418
00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.630
Can't wait!

419
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.040
There's a police station
up the road right in town!


420
00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.910
My son has been kidnapped.
Has anybody contacted you?


421
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.400
His name is Frankie,
he's six years old.


422
00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.970
And he's wearing a blue and red shirt
and he's wearing little black glasses.


423
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:40.490
And this right here is something I have...

424
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.890
...a woman's voice on the exact moment
that she was taking him.


425
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.740
She's talking on here.
She's a big huge lady.


426
00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.440
And right now he is with a man...

427
00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.810
Okay, calm down.
We're gonna call it in immediately.


428
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.220
- What's your name, ma'am.
- My name is Karla Dyson.


429
00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.330
- Describe the suspect for me.
- He's tall, skinny, white.


430
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.510
He has a red baseball cap
with blonde hair sticking out of it.


431
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:06.280
And he has on like a gray or blue,
some kind of work uniform, I don't know.


432
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.340
Wait a minute.

433
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.080
- Is nobody here with you?
- No, ma'am.


434
00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:13.050
But we can have a hundred cars
looking for them in an hour, okay?


435
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:14.710
- An hour? Oh my God, in an hour?
- I just need you to be patient.


436
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:16.800
My son is gonna
be dead in an hour!

437
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.690
No, no, it's going online.

438
00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:21.680
Every cop in the Parish
is gonna be looking for him, Karla.


439
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.920
Oh, God.

440
00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.960
Issuing amber alert
for a potential kidnapping.


441
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.530
A six years old African-American boy.
Last seen wearing a blue and red shirt.


442
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.860
Responds to Frankie Dyson.
The mother is here with me at the station.


443
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.300
Do you have a
cellphone that I can use...

444
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.460
...so if I go out there I can call and
stay in touch with you?


445
00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.210
No, ma'am. But you can use that phone
right over on that wall.


446
00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.730
I cannot use that phone?
It's right there.


447
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:46.220
Anyone you need to call?

448
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.620
Your husband?

449
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.580
Okay, my husband, yes.

450
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.190
- I need to call my husband.
- 9 in the area code.


451
00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.450
I've put out an APP for Jefferson Parish.

452
00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.380
You just need to wait, Karla.

453
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.480
<i>You've reach David Dyson.
I'm away from my desk right now.</i>


454
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.150
<i>I'll get back to you
as soon as possible. Thank you.</i>


455
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:07.880
Hi, David.

456
00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:09.950
It's me.

457
00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.930
I am in a police station in Chester.

458
00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:17.050
Frankie's been kidnapped.

459
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.130
Happened at the park.

460
00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.440
The police are out doing everything
they can looking for him.


461
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:28.070
And they said that all we have to do now
is just sit right and wait.


462
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.440
That's what all these people did.

463
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.360
They waited.

464
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.560
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
Ma'am? Ma'am?


465
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.390
Excuse me, did you see a man
with a little boy?


466
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:57.560
Is that your jacket?

467
00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:02.460
That's your jacket.

468
00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:41.880
Frankie?

469
00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:16.590
I found you, you son of a bitch!

470
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:06.690
No! No, that's not it!
It's a black Volvo!


471
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.820
Goddamnit!

472
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:10.690
Goddamnit.

473
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:19.330
No! You are not opening that door!

474
00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:24.010
I said no!

475
00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.500
Fuck you!

476
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.570
No!

477
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:46.590
Oh, God. No!

478
00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:47.830
No!

479
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:51.880
No, no, no...

480
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.460
Don't stop, don't stop.

481
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.560
- I need help!
- Are you alright?


482
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.680
- Do you have a phone?
- I got a radio.


483
01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.130
Call 911.
My son has been kidnapped!


484
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.900
- Call 911.
- Okay, but I got to go this way.


485
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.300
- I don't get a reception over here.
- But they went that way!


486
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.060
That way is a dead end.

487
01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.540
Dead end? What do you mean?

488
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.670
Look out!

489
01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:49.040
Damnit! Where's my shells?

490
01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:33.780
You had to keep coming, didn't you?

491
01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.450
Where's my son?

492
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:51.200
Where's my son!

493
01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:26.380
Terrence Vicky? 
Is that who you are?

494
01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.490
Were.

495
01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.640
125, Route 77.

496
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:36.420
Okay.

497
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:38.680
Let's see.

498
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:48.590
<i>Continue on route 77 for 2 miles.</i>

499
01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:51.350
<i>Your destination will be on the left.</i>

500
01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.040
Hello?

501
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.580
He ain't here.

502
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:29.430
Yes, we got another one
and now everything is gone to shit!


503
01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.730
Okay, then the price just doubled
because this mother has become a problem.


504
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:44.830
I told you Terry ain't here.
I had to hitch a ride back.


505
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.480
He's out taking care of the problem.

506
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:54.740
Just remember,
you are just the middleman.


507
01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:57.900
It'll be a $100,000 or you get nothing.

508
01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.690
<i>911 operator, what's your emergency?</i>

509
01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:56.950
I need help.

510
01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:01.560
<i>Ma'am?</i>

511
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:04.430
<i>Ma'am, are you there? Ma'am?</i>

512
01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.010
<i>Ma'am, we're here with you.</i>

513
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:09.160
<i>We're keeping the line open,
we're gonna get you some help.</i>


514
01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.330
<i>Do not hang up.</i>

515
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:12.930
<i>I'm gonna place you on hold
while we triangulate your location.</i>


516
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.790
<i>I'll be right back with you.</i>

517
01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.020
<i>Ma'am, I'm back. 
Is it safe to talk?</i>

518
01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.960
- What is your emergency?
- My son has been kidnapped.


519
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.500
And I'm in the house where I think
they're keeping him.


520
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:50.110
<i>We think we found you.
Can you verified your address?</i>


521
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:52.390
Yes. 125, route 77.

522
01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:55.560
<i>And do you know if there's anyone else
in the house with you, ma'am?</i>


523
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.160
I don't know, I'm not sure, but...

524
01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.420
But the woman that took him is out
in a barn or some house.


525
01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:03.490
It's near where I am.

526
01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:05.270
<i>I've already contacted
the dispatch officers.</i>


527
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:06.250
<i>They're on the way.</i>

528
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.280
<i>You need to find a safe place
to wait until they're arrive.</i>


529
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.300
Okay. How long is that gonna take?

530
01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.250
<i>They'll be there very soon.</i>

531
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:13.250
<i>I just need you to stay
on the line with me, okay?</i>


532
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.970
Okay.

533
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:17.410
- Is that gonna be like 5 minutes?
- Between 7-15 minutes, ma'am.


534
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:19.860
Oh, God, 15 minutes...
That's a long time.


535
01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.690
<i>It's alright, ma'am.
The police are on their way.</i>


536
01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:25.410
<i>I need you to get to a safe place,
stay here on the line with me now, okay?</i>


537
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:30.310
<i>Would you let me know when
you find a safe place to hide?</i>


538
01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:32.770
<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

539
01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:36.320
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- Hang up, hang up.


540
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:39.000
Oh, God.

541
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:46.950
Terry!

542
01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.640
Terry, are you back?

543
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.120
Terry, was that you on the phone?

544
01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.400
Terry!

545
01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.870
Terry!

546
01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:15.190
Frankie.

547
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:44.570
Frankie?

548
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:51.390
<i>Mommy?</i>

549
01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.290
Frankie?

550
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:55.800
<i>Mommy?</i>

551
01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:58.020
Where are you, sweetheart?

552
01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.570
Frankie.

553
01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:03.040
- Where are you, honey?
- Up here.


554
01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.850
Mommy, mommy.

555
01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:08.800
- Hi, sweetheart.
- I'm scared.


556
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.940
- Where have you been?
- Yes, I'm gonna get you down.


557
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.510
I'm gonna get you down, honey.

558
01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:14.710
<i>Are you the police?</i>

559
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.890
What is that, Frankie?

560
01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:21.240
- I'm Lucy.
- I'm Libby.


561
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.210
Oh my God, there's...

562
01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.010
There's three of you up there.

563
01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:27.970
- Mommy, give me a help.
- Okay, honey, look...


564
01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:30.240
I'm gonna get you down, okay?

565
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:32.980
- Come up the ladder.
- I can't.


566
01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.950
I can't, honey,
because the ladder is locked.


567
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:40.190
So you're gonna have to come down
through this hole.


568
01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:42.460
But first I'm gonna have to get...
No, no, Frankie, don't.


569
01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:45.750
No, don't put your legs down, honey.
You can't fit through there.


570
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:49.030
- No, just wait a second.
- Grab me.


571
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:52.420
Put your legs up, Frankie,
so mommy can hit with the shovel.


572
01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:54.810
- Put your legs...
- Grab me.


573
01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.980
Okay, Frankie, listen.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?


574
01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.790
- No, mommy, wait!
- You wait right there.


575
01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.960
Frankie, Frankie, put your legs
back up in that hole, okay?


576
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.960
We're gonna have to go fast.

577
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.470
Get your legs back up in that hole,
Frankie, right now!


578
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:27.510
- Mommy, mommy...
- Frankie!


579
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.640
Okay. Okay, come on, Frankie.
Come on.


580
01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.070
- Come on, girls. Come on.
- No, I'm scared.


581
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:10.000
- Come on, you have to come down.
- I want my mommy.


582
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:13.540
Okay, okay, okay.

583
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:16.200
We're gonna play the quiet game, okay?

584
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.270
I need both of you to be very quiet,
don't make a sound, okay?


585
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:22.380
I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna come back for you, okay?


586
01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.770
Go get her! Get her!

587
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:29.020
Come on.

588
01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.290
Come on.

589
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:39.640
Okay, Frankie, we're gonna have to hide.

590
01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.140
You sit right here, okay?

591
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:35.260
I'm gonna go get the girls, okay?

592
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:37.150
We'll get them out of here.

593
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.820
Hi, you guys, I'm back.

594
01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.330
- Come on, it's time to come down now.
- I want my mommy.


595
01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:48.020
It's okay, sweetheart.
Come on down.


596
01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:50.830
Come on, honey. I'm here to help you.
It's okay.


597
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:55.770
What the hell is going on here?

598
01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.690
Who the hell are you?

599
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:02.180
- Who are you?
- I live next door.


600
01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.720
I heard gunshots.

601
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.030
Where's Margo?

602
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:10.300
- In the water.
- What?


603
01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.540
Yeah.

604
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.420
She and her husband kidnapped my son.

605
01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:18.070
I've lived next to the Vicky's
for 14 years.


606
01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:21.330
They ain't kidnappers.
You turn around.


607
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.740
I called the police, you know.

608
01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:34.020
- Who's up there?
- Those are kids. More abducted kids.


609
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.580
Yeah, they're up there in that hole.

610
01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:43.190
Dear Lord.

611
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:46.030
We have to get them down.

612
01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.130
Hey, you two.

613
01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.070
We're gonna get you down
from there right now.


614
01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.230
- I wanna go home!
- We are gonna go home right now.


615
01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:56.630
Both of you.

616
01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.910
Just come to the opening.

617
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:01.950
Come on, girls.

618
01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.590
Come on.

619
01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.590
Wait a minute.
I never told you how many.


620
01:26:08.970 --> 01:26:11.550
And I never told you they were girls.

621
01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.590
You took the wrong kid.

622
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:52.220
Oh, sweetheart...

623
01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:48.680
<i>This is Julian Buescher with
an unbelievable story...</i>


624
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.810
<i>...breaking out of
Jefferson Parish right now.</i>


625
01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:53.360
<i>Three suspected
child abductor are dead...</i>


626
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.670
<i>...and a woman is reunited
with her son tonight.</i>


627
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:59.110
<i>After what police called it
an unprecedented civilian pursuit.</i>


628
01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:03.130
<i>Amazingly, the mother got into her
own vehicle and chase the suspects.</i>


629
01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:04.840
<i>A police spokesman has confirmed...</i>

630
01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.790
<i>...the break of an overseas
child abduction ring.</i>


631
01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:12.660
<i>Arrests has been made in Paris,
