1
00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:42.256
Mea?

2
00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:47.136
Mea.

3
00:00:50.932 --> 00:00:53.017
Would you like to
come back to the table?

4
00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:09.033
Would you like to share with us
your feelings about what Kal said?


5
00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:16.082
He just sat here and told me
that I was the reason he had an affair.


6
00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:18.668
I didn't have an affair.

7
00:01:20.253 --> 00:01:21.253
So...

8
00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:25.175
...you were just sitting there,

9
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.219
in a coffee shop, holding her hand.

10
00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:31.723
Look, I told you
that Jenna is a childhood friend.


11
00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:37.061
A childhood friend who you're close enough
to hold hands with. Is that right?


12
00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:39.063
Don't lawyer me, Mea.

13
00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:41.524
That's where he goes
when I ask him hard questions.


14
00:01:41.608 --> 00:01:44.319
No, I'm sorry,
I'm not a witness on a stand.


15
00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:45.820
I'm your husband.

16
00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:47.155
Does Jenna know that?

17
00:01:48.072 --> 00:01:51.075
Better yet, does your mother know that?

18
00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:57.123
It's his mother.

19
00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:00.543
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

20
00:02:00.627 --> 00:02:03.546
I know we only have 20 minutes left,
but it's my mom's birthday.


21
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.591
- She's pretty big on birthdays.
- And Sunday dinners.


22
00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:09.886
I'm sorry, we're gonna have to go.

23
00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.512
- No.
- Mea.


24
00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:14.098
I'm gonna stay
and finish the session. You go.


25
00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:16.434
- Mea, c'mon...
- Go, Kal.


26
00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:21.855
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:28.696
Hey, Mom?

28
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.740
Yeah, I'm on the way. Yeah.

29
00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:33.826
Does that happen often?

30
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.289
She is more a part of this marriage
than anything else.


31
00:02:38.373 --> 00:02:43.461
He feels guilty because she has cancer,
and he lost his job eight months ago.


32
00:02:44.837 --> 00:02:47.340
And he keeps begging me
not to tell his brother


33
00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:50.802
or my friend,
who is also my sister-in-law.


34
00:02:51.302 --> 00:02:54.389
I know that lots of men
love their mothers,


35
00:02:55.098 --> 00:02:57.225
but this kind of devotion is...

36
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.521
I've never seen anything like it.

37
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.990
Thank you.

38
00:03:15.994 --> 00:03:16.994
Excuse me.

39
00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:19.204
Excuse me.

40
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.006
- Ah!
- Maddy!


41
00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:29.799
Oh, Mea, hi.

42
00:03:29.882 --> 00:03:32.427
Have you met Zyair Malloy?
Come on. I'll introduce you.


43
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.638
- No need.
- Mea, he's been coming here for years.


44
00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:38.725
He's a really nice kid,
but he needs a good lawyer.


45
00:03:38.808 --> 00:03:41.394
Well, this is Chicago,
and we come a dime a dozen.


46
00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:42.979
But I know <i>you.</i>

47
00:03:43.062 --> 00:03:45.648
And your brother's the assistant DA,

48
00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:47.775
and that thing you did for my Vinny.

49
00:03:48.443 --> 00:03:49.861
Can you just talk to him?

50
00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:52.155
Can I have him
call your office, please? Please.


51
00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:54.824
Sure, on one condition.

52
00:03:54.907 --> 00:03:59.037
You send me your strongest drink.
I have to deal with my mother-in-law.


53
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.955
Oh, I understand.

54
00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.166
- You got it.
- Okay.


55
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.543
Through here.
Let me take your coat.


56
00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:11.591
Oh, look! Her Majesty the Queen
has finally arrived!


57
00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:15.178
Don't worry, son,
your second wife will be on time.


58
00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:22.602
Oh, what? What?
No happy birthday for the old lady?


59
00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:25.605
Happy birthday.

60
00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:28.107
Thank you.
I mean, not bad for 60, right?


61
00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:31.277
Oh, I want you to meet someone.

62
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:33.863
This is Jenna. 
She's a wonderful girl.

63
00:04:34.447 --> 00:04:35.447
Hi.

64
00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:38.701
I mean, I know why
my son liked her so much.


65
00:04:38.785 --> 00:04:42.288
I mean, I wish
she were my daughter-in-law.


66
00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:47.210
Well, now that the queen has arrived,
let's get the dinner out.


67
00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:48.795
I have arranged the seating.

68
00:04:48.878 --> 00:04:50.505
Jenna, you sit here,

69
00:04:50.588 --> 00:04:53.758
and, um... Mea, I... 
I know you won't mind.

70
00:04:53.841 --> 00:04:56.427
I'm sure you and Charlise wanna talk.
You can sit down there.


71
00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:01.891
Mmm!

72
00:05:05.853 --> 00:05:06.853
Happy birthday, Mom.

73
00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:10.108
Thank you, son!

74
00:05:11.984 --> 00:05:15.029
- It's from Mea and I.
- Mmm!


75
00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:19.242
You see, Jenna? What a sweet boy he is.
He's always been so sweet.


76
00:05:20.243 --> 00:05:22.286
Those two
aren't doing so well.


77
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.081
What? I'm kidding.
I mean, you know what a catch he is.


78
00:05:25.164 --> 00:05:26.207
Yeah, okay, c'mon.

79
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.501
You just had to outdo
your older brother, huh?


80
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.461
- C'mon.
- Oh!


81
00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:35.633
- Now open ours.
- Oh!


82
00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:36.843
You okay?

83
00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:40.888
Damn. What did I do
to deserve you as a friend?


84
00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:43.391
Oh, I feel the same.

85
00:05:44.267 --> 00:05:46.978
I feel like we're both
knees-deep in our relationships.


86
00:05:47.061 --> 00:05:48.396
I know.

87
00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.900
I always wanted
a man who... loved his mother.


88
00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:55.319
Well, we did get that, didn't we?

89
00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:58.281
Be careful what you ask for.

90
00:05:58.364 --> 00:06:00.658
Let's just enjoy this. All right?

91
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.328
She is drunk,
and she will be passed out in no time.


92
00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:05.913
Been hitting it hard.

93
00:06:05.997 --> 00:06:07.999
Hmm. When does she not?

94
00:06:10.376 --> 00:06:12.253
What did I miss down there?

95
00:06:13.087 --> 00:06:14.589
Oh, um,

96
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.260
we were just talking about
how lovely this is... for your birthday.


97
00:06:20.344 --> 00:06:21.846
I bet you were.

98
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:27.894
Where is my drink?

99
00:06:35.485 --> 00:06:38.613
I don't know why
there are so many paparazzi out here.


100
00:06:39.113 --> 00:06:41.449
Zyair Malloy is in there.

101
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.450
What?

102
00:06:44.076 --> 00:06:47.330
Did I ever tell you
my wife thought it'd be a good idea


103
00:06:47.413 --> 00:06:50.082
to buy two of his paintings?

104
00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:51.792
I wanna get rid of it.

105
00:06:51.876 --> 00:06:53.586
I mean... we have to.

106
00:06:55.254 --> 00:06:56.756
I'm prosecuting the case.

107
00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:59.675
You know, clear conflict there.

108
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.679
I mean, what he did to that woman was,
you know, it was awful.


109
00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:05.347
Son of a bitch.

110
00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:09.018
- You don't wanna buy a painting, do you?
- Uh-uh. No, we're good.


111
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:12.271
That's right. We bought
enough expensive things for the night.


112
00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:14.732
Thank you, Maddy!

113
00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:15.858
Come on, Mom.

114
00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:18.611
Yes, take an old woman home, huh?

115
00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:21.572
Oh! I wish you lived closer.

116
00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:23.282
I know, Mom. I know.

117
00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:25.201
We could always move to the city.

118
00:07:25.284 --> 00:07:27.078
You know Ray loves the countryside.

119
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:29.956
- Mmm! I love you, boys.
- Love you too.


120
00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:31.207
Mmm!

121
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.959
Jenna, give him a hug.

122
00:07:34.335 --> 00:07:35.461
Have a great night.

123
00:07:36.963 --> 00:07:38.923
Bye, Mea!

124
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:43.970
I love you, girl. Mmm.

125
00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:46.973
I will see you at Rumble.

126
00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:49.267
Yes,
I feel like punching something.


127
00:07:56.274 --> 00:07:57.274
Go on.

128
00:08:11.414 --> 00:08:12.414
Thank you.

129
00:08:23.426 --> 00:08:26.178
Damn. Why is this Bluetooth not playing?

130
00:08:26.262 --> 00:08:29.599
I wish it would just pick up my phone
like it does in the truck or...


131
00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:31.767
No, it should just come on
when I get in the...


132
00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:34.477
In the car.

133
00:08:35.313 --> 00:08:37.898
Thank you.
I know you're mad about the watch.


134
00:08:37.982 --> 00:08:40.901
And I knew you would say no,
but... but it's my mom.


135
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:43.195
How much was it?

136
00:08:45.031 --> 00:08:46.324
I sold the piano.

137
00:08:48.618 --> 00:08:50.745
Come on!
Look, you don't even play it anymore.


138
00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:54.624
You stopped years ago, and it was just...
sat there collecting dust.


139
00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:57.793
And it was mine in the first place.

140
00:08:57.877 --> 00:09:01.756
So yours and mine now.
Is... is that where we are?


141
00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:03.382
I'm not trying to fight.

142
00:09:04.383 --> 00:09:06.719
Look, I'll buy you another piano, Mea.

143
00:09:07.303 --> 00:09:10.765
She's done everything for me and Ray,
and now she's dying.


144
00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:13.476
Did your mom invite Jenna?

145
00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:16.937
C'mon, I'm just... I'm just trying to make
her last few days happy.


146
00:09:17.563 --> 00:09:19.565
I don't care about Jenna!

147
00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:21.067
I don't want her at all!

148
00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:23.277
She's not you!

149
00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:24.945
No one is you.

150
00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:27.156
<i>♪ You will be
the end of me ♪</i>

151
00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:30.951
<i>♪ You will be
the end of me ♪</i>

152
00:10:12.076 --> 00:10:13.077
Good morning.

153
00:10:17.623 --> 00:10:20.835
- What's that look for?
- Zyair Malloy is in your office.


154
00:10:20.918 --> 00:10:21.836
What? Why?

155
00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:24.672
Everyone was staring at him out here,
so I put him in your office.


156
00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:25.923
He was supposed to call.

157
00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:29.677
- Should I push your ten o'clock...
- No, no, this won't take long.


158
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.431
Good morning.

159
00:10:36.225 --> 00:10:37.351
Mr. Malloy?

160
00:10:37.435 --> 00:10:38.686
I'm Mea Harper.

161
00:10:41.188 --> 00:10:42.188
Zyair.

162
00:10:43.774 --> 00:10:45.776
Maddy told me that you would call.

163
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.530
Police raided my loft
for the second time this morning,


164
00:10:49.613 --> 00:10:52.241
intentionally damaging
two commissioned works.


165
00:10:52.324 --> 00:10:53.701
That has to be illegal.

166
00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:56.746
Coffee?

167
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:59.498
No. That... stuff makes me crazy.

168
00:10:59.582 --> 00:11:01.751
Not... literally.

169
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.710
I did not

170
00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:06.213
kill my girlfriend.

171
00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:10.509
This is my life,
and they're trying to ruin me.


172
00:11:10.593 --> 00:11:12.136
And who would "they" be?

173
00:11:12.219 --> 00:11:13.971
That tender-dick DA.

174
00:11:14.847 --> 00:11:15.847
He hates me.

175
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.349
Why would he hate you?

176
00:11:17.933 --> 00:11:18.933
I don't know.

177
00:11:21.479 --> 00:11:23.939
Can you rep me?
Maddy tells me you're the best.


178
00:11:24.023 --> 00:11:26.776
And if he says you're the one...
you're the one.


179
00:11:26.859 --> 00:11:28.819
There's a conflict here.

180
00:11:28.903 --> 00:11:31.906
The DA has appointed your case
to the assistant DA,


181
00:11:31.989 --> 00:11:33.365
who is my brother-in-law.

182
00:11:33.449 --> 00:11:37.411
Brother-in-law.
Then I assume you love your husband. Yes?


183
00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:43.042
Imagine if your husband turned up missing,
and everyone blamed <i>you</i> for it.


184
00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:45.669
It's insane. And it's everywhere.

185
00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:48.172
Will you help me?

186
00:11:48.255 --> 00:11:49.089
Mr. Malloy.

187
00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:51.258
Zyair. Please.

188
00:11:51.342 --> 00:11:54.595
I don't tend to make decisions
based on what's popular...


189
00:11:54.678 --> 00:11:55.805
- Good.
- ...or in headlines.


190
00:11:55.888 --> 00:11:58.891
Good. Because they're all lies.

191
00:11:59.517 --> 00:12:02.561
- Our firm has a retainer of seven...
- It doesn't matter.


192
00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:07.399
I'll tell you what I'll do.

193
00:12:07.483 --> 00:12:10.110
I'll take a look at what
the prosecution has and get back to you.


194
00:12:10.194 --> 00:12:11.194
Today?

195
00:12:11.821 --> 00:12:13.572
I'll let you know when I can.

196
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:17.660
Unlock your phone.
Put my number in.


197
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.046
You can leave it with my secretary
on your way out.


198
00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:32.257
Thank you.

199
00:12:33.884 --> 00:12:35.719
I apologize for bargin' in.

200
00:12:41.058 --> 00:12:42.184
Hoo!

201
00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:44.687
My God!

202
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.691
That was a hard-ass class,
but you barely broke a sweat.


203
00:12:48.774 --> 00:12:50.192
It's cold!

204
00:12:50.276 --> 00:12:53.445
But you usually got a little sprinkle
going on on the forehead.


205
00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:56.073
I... Yo, I'm not gonna say anything else.

206
00:12:56.156 --> 00:12:57.156
Oh!

207
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.034
Ooh, speaking of cold...

208
00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:00.536
No.

209
00:13:00.619 --> 00:13:02.079
Don't do it!

210
00:13:02.162 --> 00:13:05.040
Hi! I'm gonna take a chocolate.

211
00:13:06.834 --> 00:13:10.129
- You feel better now?
- Ooooh!


212
00:13:10.212 --> 00:13:11.714
We hate Malloy!

213
00:13:11.797 --> 00:13:13.090
Put him in jail...

214
00:13:13.173 --> 00:13:16.010
They march
outside that building every day,


215
00:13:16.093 --> 00:13:19.388
and that woman refuses
to take his paintings down.


216
00:13:20.055 --> 00:13:22.516
Between you and I, 
Ray is loving this.

217
00:13:24.393 --> 00:13:25.519
He came to see me.

218
00:13:26.645 --> 00:13:27.771
- Who?
- Zyair.


219
00:13:29.273 --> 00:13:32.151
- He wants me to represent him.
- What?


220
00:13:32.234 --> 00:13:33.360
Don't do it.

221
00:13:34.028 --> 00:13:36.739
Charlise, this is what I do.

222
00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:38.657
Promise me you won't.

223
00:13:41.285 --> 00:13:43.579
I... I'm just thinking about it.

224
00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:45.706
<i>♪ He killed her ♪</i>

225
00:13:45.789 --> 00:13:47.082
<i>♪ He can go to hell ♪</i>

226
00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:56.716
Hey.

227
00:13:57.217 --> 00:13:59.428
You scared the heck out of me.

228
00:14:01.722 --> 00:14:02.722
Kal.

229
00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:05.100
- What the...
- I was looking at that.


230
00:14:05.184 --> 00:14:06.393
You can't represent him.

231
00:14:06.936 --> 00:14:08.520
Kal, give me the file.

232
00:14:08.604 --> 00:14:11.482
Look, I don't care. I said no.

233
00:14:11.565 --> 00:14:14.985
I'm not having it in the press
my wife is battling for this murderer.


234
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:18.280
I defend murderers all the time.
Hence, "defense attorney."


235
00:14:18.364 --> 00:14:19.740
Not against my brother.

236
00:14:20.282 --> 00:14:21.408
It's not happenin'.

237
00:14:23.786 --> 00:14:25.204
Oh, look, I'm...

238
00:14:28.082 --> 00:14:29.792
What are...

239
00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:30.875
Pick one.

240
00:14:31.293 --> 00:14:34.004
Tell me... which one <i>you</i> will pay,

241
00:14:34.088 --> 00:14:36.382
and then tell me
what you're not gonna let me do.


242
00:14:36.465 --> 00:14:38.258
- Mea, look...
- The house note?


243
00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:41.387
The car note? Your mom's medical bills?

244
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.473
Because... God forbid
she should have health insurance.


245
00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:47.726
Are you really saying
this is about my dying mother?!


246
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.896
We send your brother
huge checks for her every month.


247
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.816
And you don't want me
to tell them that you lost your job?


248
00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:55.651
Ugh. Go on. Say it.

249
00:14:55.734 --> 00:14:57.152
You think I'm not?

250
00:14:57.236 --> 00:15:01.073
If you hadn't gone
to work so damn high

251
00:15:01.156 --> 00:15:03.450
and reeking of alcohol,

252
00:15:03.534 --> 00:15:05.661
we wouldn't be in this situation.

253
00:15:05.744 --> 00:15:08.414
It's a really good look
for an anesthesiologist.


254
00:15:08.497 --> 00:15:12.251
Kal... addicted to his own shit.

255
00:15:12.334 --> 00:15:15.963
And now I'm here
trying to hold it all together.


256
00:15:16.547 --> 00:15:21.343
This case will earn me just enough
to get us through the next few months.


257
00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:25.764
So don't tell me
what I will or will not do.


258
00:15:30.936 --> 00:15:32.104
- Mea...
- Pick one.


259
00:15:50.122 --> 00:15:51.957
<i>Mr. Malloy, this is Mea Harper.</i>

260
00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:54.376
<i>Hi.</i>

261
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.336
<i>Please, Zyair.</i>

262
00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.049
<i>I'd like to meet with you tomorrow
at my office if I could.</i>


263
00:16:00.132 --> 00:16:03.177
<i>I've got some questions
before I can give you an answer.</i>


264
00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:06.889
<i>All right.
I'll have to ditch the paparazzi.</i>


265
00:16:06.972 --> 00:16:08.307
<i>They follow me everywhere.</i>

266
00:16:09.308 --> 00:16:11.643
<i>On second thought, 
I'll come to you.</i>

267
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:15.147
<i>Take the elevator on the right.
The door is sticky.</i>


268
00:16:35.292 --> 00:16:39.671
<i>♪ If you see me

277
00:17:23.882 --> 00:17:25.134
Apologies. Just...

278
00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:27.052
just one moment.

279
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:52.744
What do you see?

280
00:17:53.912 --> 00:17:55.289
First word.

281
00:17:57.833 --> 00:17:58.834
Longing.

282
00:18:01.378 --> 00:18:04.965
Mea... is... longing.

283
00:18:08.677 --> 00:18:11.471
There's, uh,
water and alcohol on the counter.


284
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:13.724
Cruise around, please.

285
00:18:13.807 --> 00:18:18.604
It's gotta be helpful for you to see,
being a... so-called crime scene and all.


286
00:18:30.407 --> 00:18:31.533
It's my new piece.

287
00:18:33.577 --> 00:18:35.454
It's called <i>She Lives in Notes.</i>

288
00:18:36.705 --> 00:18:38.916
You can actually play it
if you sit at the bench.


289
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.750
You play?

290
00:18:42.586 --> 00:18:43.586
No.

291
00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:48.675
- Does it speak to you?
- How could it not?


292
00:18:50.135 --> 00:18:51.261
What is she saying?

293
00:18:54.097 --> 00:18:55.807
It's actually asking...

294
00:18:57.935 --> 00:18:59.394
shall we get started?

295
00:19:03.941 --> 00:19:04.941
Please.

296
00:19:07.694 --> 00:19:10.072
What the prosecution has
is pretty damning.


297
00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:12.532
So I need to know
what you have to say about it.


298
00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:14.076
As an artist,

299
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.496
I know that you
have an eye for details.

300
00:19:17.579 --> 00:19:19.373
So don't leave anything out.

301
00:19:20.582 --> 00:19:22.834
The things you think are not important

302
00:19:23.502 --> 00:19:25.671
may be the thing
that I need to know the most.


303
00:19:29.925 --> 00:19:31.051
Portofino.

304
00:19:33.178 --> 00:19:34.388
We met in Italy.

305
00:19:35.138 --> 00:19:36.598
Beautiful place,

306
00:19:37.724 --> 00:19:39.017
super romantic.

307
00:19:39.726 --> 00:19:43.855
I was out there on vacation,
longing for inspiration,


308
00:19:44.523 --> 00:19:45.524
met this

309
00:19:46.733 --> 00:19:48.443
Mexican goddess

310
00:19:49.569 --> 00:19:50.946
at a little restaurant.

311
00:19:52.072 --> 00:19:53.323
She was my waitress.

312
00:19:55.867 --> 00:19:58.745
I was there for ten days. 
We hit it off.

313
00:20:01.331 --> 00:20:02.331
She...

314
00:20:03.375 --> 00:20:04.375
Yeah.

315
00:20:05.877 --> 00:20:07.546
There's a little photo album.

316
00:20:09.298 --> 00:20:11.925
She was a... She was a selfie queen.

317
00:20:12.009 --> 00:20:15.345
So... always taking photos.

318
00:20:16.346 --> 00:20:18.223
Every day is pretty much documented.

319
00:20:24.187 --> 00:20:28.775
I saw in the discovery
that the police have your electronics.


320
00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:32.029
But they didn't take this?

321
00:20:35.073 --> 00:20:37.451
Look, all I can tell you is,

322
00:20:38.452 --> 00:20:40.412
for six months, we were inseparable.

323
00:20:42.122 --> 00:20:46.376
And... one day, I went to an exhibit
and came back, and she was gone.


324
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.508
Have you seen these photos?

325
00:20:57.179 --> 00:20:58.930
There was so much blood

326
00:21:00.098 --> 00:21:03.477
that it seeped down
into your neighbor's apartment below.


327
00:21:06.063 --> 00:21:08.482
The blood type and DNA

328
00:21:09.441 --> 00:21:11.318
matches your girlfriend.

329
00:21:16.573 --> 00:21:20.077
These skull fragments
were found in one of your paintings.


330
00:21:20.744 --> 00:21:21.828
Her skull,

331
00:21:21.912 --> 00:21:23.121
her hair,

332
00:21:23.205 --> 00:21:24.247
her DNA.

333
00:21:25.123 --> 00:21:27.709
And that painting would have been hanging...

334
00:21:38.762 --> 00:21:40.180
would have been hanging...

335
00:21:42.432 --> 00:21:43.266
there.

336
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.895
And the blood would have been about...

337
00:21:51.525 --> 00:21:52.609
here.

338
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.031
Do you wanna explain to me
how this happened?


339
00:21:58.865 --> 00:21:59.865
I don't know.

340
00:22:08.542 --> 00:22:12.587
The painting in this photo is
the prosecution's Exhibit B.


341
00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:15.215
Can you tell me
what the name of that painting is?


342
00:22:15.298 --> 00:22:17.717
- The one with her skull fragments in it?
- Yeah...


343
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:19.010
Hydie was a...

344
00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:21.388
was a very silly girl.

345
00:22:22.764 --> 00:22:24.891
And just like I asked you
to name that painting,


346
00:22:24.975 --> 00:22:26.435
I asked her to name this one.

347
00:22:31.189 --> 00:22:32.649
She named it <i>Evil Bitch.</i>

348
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.194
I didn't think that was it,
but we had a laugh about it,


349
00:22:36.278 --> 00:22:40.323
and... I just left it.
Just wanted to make her happy.


350
00:22:40.407 --> 00:22:44.286
- And the fragments of her skull?
- Why do you keep... Why... Stop saying that.


351
00:22:44.369 --> 00:22:47.497
- Why do you keep saying that?
- The prosecution is going to say it.


352
00:22:47.581 --> 00:22:48.581
A lot.

353
00:22:50.584 --> 00:22:54.171
- How do you think this happened?
- I don't... I don't know, Mea!


354
00:22:54.254 --> 00:22:55.254
What do you...

355
00:22:58.425 --> 00:23:01.011
This is fuckin' bullshit, yo.

356
00:23:03.263 --> 00:23:06.892
<i>He is gonna kill me.
Please, I need to get away from him.</i>


357
00:23:08.435 --> 00:23:11.771
<i>If you... get this, he did it.</i>

358
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:14.983
<i>He killed me.</i>

359
00:23:17.402 --> 00:23:19.779
- You hadn't seen this?
- That's not real.


360
00:23:21.323 --> 00:23:23.325
- Why would she record this?
- I don't know.


361
00:23:26.703 --> 00:23:29.206
What about
the $3 million life insurance policy?


362
00:23:29.289 --> 00:23:32.167
I don't know anything about
a $3 million life policy.


363
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.628
I didn't take anything out on her.
I don't know...


364
00:23:35.128 --> 00:23:36.880
I didn't kill her, Mea.

365
00:23:37.964 --> 00:23:40.467
I am not going to lie to you.

366
00:23:42.135 --> 00:23:44.346
This is going to be an uphill battle.

367
00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:48.058
If I take you on, 
I have one demand.

368
00:23:48.642 --> 00:23:49.726
You can never...

369
00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:51.769
Look at me!

370
00:23:55.482 --> 00:23:56.733
Look at me.

371
00:24:01.196 --> 00:24:02.196
You

372
00:24:02.739 --> 00:24:04.366
can never lie to me.

373
00:24:05.617 --> 00:24:07.494
You have to tell me everything,

374
00:24:08.203 --> 00:24:12.999
no matter how uncomfortable
or insignificant you may think it is.


375
00:24:16.044 --> 00:24:17.044
Of course.

376
00:24:19.631 --> 00:24:20.882
You gonna take me on?

377
00:24:23.009 --> 00:24:27.097
Ah, honey, you have got to get
more than takeout in this house.


378
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.432
Look at how my boy is thinning.

379
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.852
I didn't know we were having company.

380
00:24:37.399 --> 00:24:38.608
You're not eating.

381
00:24:40.151 --> 00:24:41.653
You're insulting my cooking.

382
00:24:41.736 --> 00:24:44.573
Mea, c'mon. Mom came after chemo.

383
00:24:47.367 --> 00:24:48.367
Thank you.

384
00:24:48.994 --> 00:24:51.663
The food is great. 
I appreciate it.

385
00:24:52.914 --> 00:24:55.083
Why do I feel like
there's a "but" in there?


386
00:24:56.876 --> 00:25:00.380
Well... in all the years we've been married,

387
00:25:01.798 --> 00:25:03.174
you've never done this.

388
00:25:03.883 --> 00:25:06.428
I thought we'd have
a nice family dinner together.


389
00:25:06.928 --> 00:25:07.928
We were free.

390
00:25:08.513 --> 00:25:10.015
Mom felt up for it.

391
00:25:11.641 --> 00:25:13.476
I have some news
I wanna share with you.

392
00:25:15.729 --> 00:25:16.896
I'm running for mayor.

393
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.690
Oh, that's great.

394
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.525
And he's gonna win.

395
00:25:21.151 --> 00:25:22.360
I'm sure.

396
00:25:23.403 --> 00:25:26.281
So... what's new with you?

397
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:29.576
Ah, nothing much.

398
00:25:31.411 --> 00:25:32.662
Same ol', same ol'.

399
00:25:37.417 --> 00:25:38.543
Any new clients?

400
00:25:40.712 --> 00:25:42.380
As a matter of fact,

401
00:25:43.173 --> 00:25:47.594
I am considering repping Zyair Malloy.

402
00:25:51.348 --> 00:25:53.433
No. You're not.

403
00:25:54.225 --> 00:25:55.769
Excuse me?

404
00:25:55.852 --> 00:25:58.730
Your brother-in-law
is going to win that case.


405
00:25:59.606 --> 00:26:02.442
He's going to build his campaign
on fighting crime.


406
00:26:03.026 --> 00:26:04.026
Tell 'em, son.

407
00:26:06.571 --> 00:26:09.282
Crime is... awful here,

408
00:26:10.575 --> 00:26:12.535
and he's gonna be my poster boy.

409
00:26:15.205 --> 00:26:18.249
So, if my sister-in-law defends him,

410
00:26:19.542 --> 00:26:22.462
well, you see
the dilemma there, right, Mea?


411
00:26:24.089 --> 00:26:25.507
Did you see the discovery?

412
00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:28.468
We are gonna bury him.

413
00:26:29.844 --> 00:26:31.096
If you represent him,

414
00:26:31.763 --> 00:26:34.974
I'll have to recuse myself
because of our family connection, and,


415
00:26:35.475 --> 00:26:37.602
well, that's not something
I'm willing to do.


416
00:26:37.686 --> 00:26:40.105
So you will not represent him.

417
00:26:41.356 --> 00:26:43.274
Well, I hadn't made a decision.

418
00:26:44.109 --> 00:26:45.902
No, you have.

419
00:26:45.985 --> 00:26:47.195
<i>We</i> have.

420
00:26:48.488 --> 00:26:50.990
And you're part of this family now,
and we have a say.


421
00:26:51.074 --> 00:26:53.910
So... you're not representing him.

422
00:26:59.499 --> 00:27:01.543
I wasn't sure if I would represent him.

423
00:27:02.836 --> 00:27:03.836
And now...

424
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.881
I have my answer.

425
00:27:07.757 --> 00:27:08.842
Wonderful.

426
00:27:09.592 --> 00:27:11.302
Would you like some more lamb?

427
00:27:21.855 --> 00:27:23.273
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

428
00:27:24.274 --> 00:27:25.525
About what?

429
00:27:25.608 --> 00:27:31.072
Look, Kal called and told Ray
that you're representing Zyair.


430
00:27:31.156 --> 00:27:33.783
<i>He and his mom hit the roof.</i>

431
00:27:34.743 --> 00:27:36.286
I tried to calm them down,

432
00:27:36.369 --> 00:27:40.415
and... I told them
you're just thinking about it.


433
00:27:40.498 --> 00:27:42.542
Why would you do that?

434
00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:44.627
Well, they were going to find out,

435
00:27:44.711 --> 00:27:47.922
and... you know how it gets around here
when they're mad.


436
00:27:48.465 --> 00:27:50.467
And she's sick, so I just...

437
00:27:50.967 --> 00:27:51.967
I...

438
00:27:52.385 --> 00:27:53.678
I'm sorry, Mea.

439
00:27:53.762 --> 00:27:56.097
It's okay. I'll call you later.

440
00:27:56.181 --> 00:27:57.682
<i>- You're upset.</i>
- No.


441
00:27:57.766 --> 00:27:59.809
<i>Not at all. 
I'll call you later.</i>

442
00:27:59.893 --> 00:28:00.727
Are you sure?

443
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.479
Yes. I have an appointment.

444
00:28:02.562 --> 00:28:03.855
<i>Okay, call me later.</i>

445
00:28:03.938 --> 00:28:04.939
Yeah, I will.

446
00:28:05.899 --> 00:28:08.026
- Good morning. You're here early.
- Good morning.


447
00:28:08.109 --> 00:28:09.235
I need everything you have

448
00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:13.281
on the State of Massachusetts versus Brown
and Wilson versus the State of New Mexico.


449
00:28:13.364 --> 00:28:14.240
On it.

450
00:28:14.324 --> 00:28:17.744
- Ah, Jimmy should be here any second.
- He's... out there already.


451
00:28:17.827 --> 00:28:22.165
Oh, bring him in. And find out
who the judge is on Zyair Malloy's case.


452
00:28:22.248 --> 00:28:25.084
Ask to meet in the chambers
with the prosecution


453
00:28:25.168 --> 00:28:27.545
to talk about a family conflict.

454
00:28:27.629 --> 00:28:29.964
You're... repping Zyair Malloy?

455
00:28:30.048 --> 00:28:31.174
You're damn right.

456
00:28:34.844 --> 00:28:37.263
- Thank you. H-hey!
- Hey.


457
00:28:38.014 --> 00:28:40.141
Ah, look at you!

458
00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:42.685
How you doin'? You good?

459
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:44.437
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you okay?


460
00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:46.606
- It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.


461
00:28:46.689 --> 00:28:49.359
C'mon. I could hear it
in your voice on the phone.


462
00:28:49.442 --> 00:28:50.527
So what is it?

463
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.946
I need you. I need your help.

464
00:28:53.571 --> 00:28:54.571
Okay.

465
00:28:55.448 --> 00:28:57.742
Can we... take a walk? 
I need some air.

466
00:28:57.826 --> 00:28:58.993
- Yeah.
- Good.


467
00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:03.957
All right, so what did Kal do now?
Hmm? Am I following him again?


468
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.874
No.

469
00:29:04.958 --> 00:29:08.253
- So you guys workin' it out?
- They were just at the coffee shop.


470
00:29:08.336 --> 00:29:11.506
I know. And if it had been anything else,
I would have found it.


471
00:29:11.589 --> 00:29:15.176
I know. You told me about
his drug habit before he lost his job.


472
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.304
I wrestled with that.
I just didn't want you in the dark.


473
00:29:19.097 --> 00:29:21.516
- Always tell me what you find, Jimmy.
- Yes.


474
00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:25.144
You're the best private investigator,
so... just tell me.


475
00:29:25.228 --> 00:29:28.481
- Just don't like seeing you hurting.
- Me being in the dark is more hurtful.


476
00:29:28.565 --> 00:29:32.527
Okay. You know how I feel about you,
right? You're like a sister to me.


477
00:29:34.737 --> 00:29:36.656
- I'm okay.
- All right.


478
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.740
So,

479
00:29:39.534 --> 00:29:40.534
how's Kal?

480
00:29:41.911 --> 00:29:43.204
- Don't do that.
- What?


481
00:29:43.872 --> 00:29:45.498
- Don't do what? What I do?
- I know you.


482
00:29:45.582 --> 00:29:46.958
What?

483
00:29:47.041 --> 00:29:48.209
So just tell me.

484
00:29:49.627 --> 00:29:52.881
Fine. Fine. He goes to his rehab,
and then he goes back home.


485
00:29:53.756 --> 00:29:56.050
I <i>knew</i> you were still watching.

486
00:29:56.801 --> 00:30:00.722
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, is he still lying
to his folks about losing his job?


487
00:30:03.182 --> 00:30:04.601
It's a lot, Jimmy.

488
00:30:05.268 --> 00:30:06.268
I know.

489
00:30:08.313 --> 00:30:09.606
My work helps.

490
00:30:11.774 --> 00:30:13.776
- Did you get the information I sent you?
- Yes.


491
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.113
I already started trying to track
the girlfriend's family in Mexico.


492
00:30:17.697 --> 00:30:18.531
And?

493
00:30:18.615 --> 00:30:22.118
Well, strangely, either no one's
ever heard of them, or they're all scared.


494
00:30:22.201 --> 00:30:25.622
Which is common. I should have cell phone
metadata from his and her phones too.


495
00:30:25.705 --> 00:30:26.831
Is that legal?

496
00:30:26.915 --> 00:30:30.126
You know the rules. Don't ask me
any questions, and I'll indemnify you.


497
00:30:30.209 --> 00:30:32.378
- Sorry.
- Nah.


498
00:30:32.462 --> 00:30:34.422
The witness list for the prosecution?

499
00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:35.965
Listen, if you really wanna do this,

500
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:38.927
I'll find anything
and everything I can for you, okay?


501
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.178
But you know what?

502
00:30:41.596 --> 00:30:42.805
You don't seem sure.

503
00:30:43.598 --> 00:30:47.018
Hmm? And I know
your brother-in-law has gotta be pissed.


504
00:30:47.101 --> 00:30:49.771
- He's such a dick.
- Ah, he is!


505
00:30:50.813 --> 00:30:52.607
- But I'm doing it.
- You doin' it?


506
00:30:53.358 --> 00:30:56.861
Okay, I hope it's because of your gut
and not because you're angry with him.


507
00:30:56.945 --> 00:30:59.989
You always go with your gut, Mea.
Don't change that.


508
00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:03.033
I won't.

509
00:31:03.618 --> 00:31:05.119
So you believe this Zyair guy?

510
00:31:06.329 --> 00:31:07.747
Let's...

511
00:31:09.207 --> 00:31:11.125
let's see what happens
when we talk to him.


512
00:31:11.209 --> 00:31:13.044
All right. All right.

513
00:31:13.127 --> 00:31:14.462
- All right?
- All right.


514
00:31:16.714 --> 00:31:20.218
What <i>is</i> this?
You're the only firm he can retain?


515
00:31:20.301 --> 00:31:24.055
I'm sure there are others,
but he wants my firm, Your Honor.


516
00:31:24.138 --> 00:31:26.099
And as you know,
the defendant has the right


517
00:31:26.182 --> 00:31:27.976
to choose the counsel of his choice.

518
00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:29.644
Of course I know that.

519
00:31:31.187 --> 00:31:33.940
So, Ray, you don't want to...

520
00:31:34.023 --> 00:31:37.110
I would prefer not to recuse myself
if Your Honor would see fit.


521
00:31:37.193 --> 00:31:39.821
This is your sister-in-law.

522
00:31:40.697 --> 00:31:43.032
She knew I was prosecuting the case,

523
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.578
which I think she took on purpose
just to antagonize my brother,


524
00:31:48.079 --> 00:31:50.123
who has done everything for her.

525
00:31:52.083 --> 00:31:56.087
Well, it's obvious that this, uh... animus
will make for terrible bedfellows,


526
00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.756
so, um, I think
I'm going to allow it.

527
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.718
But if I get
a hint of anything improper,

528
00:32:02.218 --> 00:32:05.221
I will refer you both to the bar.

529
00:32:06.347 --> 00:32:07.765
Thank you, Your Honor.

530
00:32:08.474 --> 00:32:09.809
Thank you, Your Honor.

531
00:32:17.608 --> 00:32:20.611
So she never told you
where her parents lived in Mexico?


532
00:32:20.695 --> 00:32:24.323
We were actually gonna go visit
when I had a chance to take a break, but...


533
00:32:25.992 --> 00:32:27.326
we weren't together long.

534
00:32:28.995 --> 00:32:31.456
And then why did she send that video
to her sister


535
00:32:31.539 --> 00:32:33.082
saying those things about you?

536
00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:36.419
I... I didn't even know she had a sister.
I don't know.


537
00:32:36.502 --> 00:32:38.671
Hmm. You didn't know
where her parents live.


538
00:32:38.755 --> 00:32:40.423
You didn't know she had a sister...

539
00:32:40.506 --> 00:32:43.051
- I didn't do anything... to her.
- Hmm.


540
00:32:44.218 --> 00:32:46.012
Well, you did something to her.

541
00:32:46.721 --> 00:32:47.721
Yeah?

542
00:32:49.182 --> 00:32:50.558
Sex. Right?

543
00:32:50.641 --> 00:32:52.268
I mean, that was your girl.

544
00:32:52.769 --> 00:32:55.813
Now, don't look at her.
'Cause she's thinking the same thing.


545
00:32:55.897 --> 00:32:58.941
- Of course we had sex, man.
- Yeah, you had sex. Pretty erotic?


546
00:32:59.025 --> 00:33:02.070
Like your ex?
Let's see what she said, actually.


547
00:33:03.863 --> 00:33:06.282
Let's see. I read somethin'.

548
00:33:06.365 --> 00:33:07.575
Ah, there it is.

549
00:33:07.658 --> 00:33:11.204
"He liked to pull my hair
and make me gag."


550
00:33:11.788 --> 00:33:13.289
"Spit on me."

551
00:33:13.372 --> 00:33:15.583
"He got pleasure when I was in pain."

552
00:33:16.292 --> 00:33:17.710
"He was sadistic."

553
00:33:18.795 --> 00:33:21.005
Hmm. Take a look at that, Mea.

554
00:33:22.173 --> 00:33:24.217
Yeah. Right there.

555
00:33:24.717 --> 00:33:27.095
"Deep was never deep enough for him."

556
00:33:28.346 --> 00:33:30.890
"If I didn't show pleasure on my face,

557
00:33:31.891 --> 00:33:34.435
he would do things
to make me show pain."

558
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:38.689
"Things like bite my nipples
and choke me until I passed out."


559
00:33:39.816 --> 00:33:41.651
That's so one-sided. That was...

560
00:33:44.112 --> 00:33:45.279
that was her thing.

561
00:33:45.863 --> 00:33:47.198
Why you smiling about it?

562
00:33:49.867 --> 00:33:50.867
Listen.

563
00:33:51.619 --> 00:33:53.746
She was... she just was...

564
00:33:55.706 --> 00:33:56.916
that's how she was.

565
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.920
She was an insatiable woman
'cause she would do the same stuff to me.


566
00:34:01.003 --> 00:34:02.296
She would choke me.

567
00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:05.800
She would bite me,
pour hot candle wax on me.


568
00:34:05.883 --> 00:34:06.883
It was a game.

569
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.138
It was too much for me,
so I had to end it.


570
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:11.597
That's why she's angry.

571
00:34:11.681 --> 00:34:14.225
- Oh, wait. You ended it?
<i>- I</i> ended it.


572
00:34:14.308 --> 00:34:16.435
She says <i>she</i> ended it,
and you stalked her.


573
00:34:16.519 --> 00:34:17.519
No.

574
00:34:17.937 --> 00:34:18.937
Actually,

575
00:34:19.814 --> 00:34:21.149
it's the other way around.

576
00:34:21.232 --> 00:34:23.818
Ooh, man, you got
a lot of women after you, don't you?


577
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:26.487
Well, you know, sometimes it's like that.

578
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:29.073
Okay. Arrogant motherfucker too.

579
00:34:29.991 --> 00:34:31.826
I like it, though, personally.

580
00:34:32.326 --> 00:34:33.953
- How... the fuck? What is...
- Jimmy...


581
00:34:34.036 --> 00:34:35.997
- I'm sorry. I was...
- Sorry.


582
00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:38.290
I ended it.

583
00:34:39.208 --> 00:34:40.459
She couldn't take it.

584
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:44.922
She was trying to take things too far.
I didn't feel comfortable with it.


585
00:34:45.423 --> 00:34:46.423
And that was that.

586
00:34:47.717 --> 00:34:49.218
What's going too far?

587
00:34:49.302 --> 00:34:51.888
Bashing her head in?
Putting her skull in the painting?


588
00:34:51.971 --> 00:34:53.532
- How is this helping me?
- Jimmy...


589
00:34:53.556 --> 00:34:56.893
What? I'm just... He's sitting there
with a smirk on his face. I just...


590
00:34:58.644 --> 00:35:00.855
Did you do these erotic things with Hydie?

591
00:35:00.938 --> 00:35:05.026
No, Hydie wasn't that way at all.
Which is why I loved her so much.


592
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:06.109
It was

593
00:35:06.944 --> 00:35:08.321
much better with Hydie.

594
00:35:09.488 --> 00:35:11.407
I never did anything to hurt her.

595
00:35:12.241 --> 00:35:15.953
So you didn't get high,
and then y'all got into some kinky shit...


596
00:35:16.037 --> 00:35:18.206
- No!
- Maybe things got a little, you know...


597
00:35:18.289 --> 00:35:19.999
- Maybe things got out of control.
- No.


598
00:35:20.082 --> 00:35:22.752
- That's all I'm suggesting. Maybe?
- No.


599
00:35:23.419 --> 00:35:24.253
Okay.

600
00:35:24.337 --> 00:35:27.840
Well... that is my time.

601
00:35:27.924 --> 00:35:31.302
Got a plane to catch. Headed to Mexico
to see how I can help you, kid.


602
00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:36.265
You got any stairs? 'Cause, uh...
man, that elevator's some creepy shit.


603
00:35:37.183 --> 00:35:40.061
- All right. I'll be in touch.
- Yeah.


604
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.648
I'll be right back.

605
00:35:49.862 --> 00:35:50.863
Jimmy!

606
00:35:51.489 --> 00:35:52.489
Wait.

607
00:35:58.204 --> 00:35:59.204
All right.

608
00:36:01.165 --> 00:36:02.416
So what do you think?

609
00:36:04.377 --> 00:36:07.296
Well, you read body language
better than experts.


610
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.174
Give me your opinion.

611
00:36:10.675 --> 00:36:12.343
I mean, he wasn't blinking a lot.

612
00:36:12.426 --> 00:36:14.971
His inflections were up
in all the right places.


613
00:36:15.054 --> 00:36:16.305
Voice was pitched right.

614
00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:19.058
That fucker's lying.
That's what I think.


615
00:36:19.558 --> 00:36:22.186
If he's not lying, he is a psychopath.

616
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:27.024
All right? And he believes his lie so much
that he could... he could fool even me.


617
00:36:27.108 --> 00:36:28.401
Crazy, 'cause...

618
00:36:29.527 --> 00:36:32.530
- I feel the same way.
- You feel the same way. Yeah.


619
00:36:34.031 --> 00:36:34.907
Shit.

620
00:36:34.991 --> 00:36:36.575
I'll call you from Mexico?

621
00:36:37.076 --> 00:36:38.077
Okay.

622
00:36:38.786 --> 00:36:40.288
- Adios.
- Hmm.


623
00:36:51.882 --> 00:36:52.882
Zyair?

624
00:37:10.276 --> 00:37:11.276
Zyair?

625
00:37:27.543 --> 00:37:28.711
You're out on bail.

626
00:37:29.503 --> 00:37:30.838
You shouldn't do that.

627
00:37:33.007 --> 00:37:34.175
So turn me in.

628
00:37:37.887 --> 00:37:41.849
The prosecution can request a drug test
at any time.


629
00:37:42.725 --> 00:37:45.311
Do you wanna do
this entire trial from jail?


630
00:37:46.312 --> 00:37:48.105
Mr. Malloy, if I'm your attorney,

631
00:37:48.731 --> 00:37:52.234
no more going out to fancy restaurants
with the paparazzi watching.


632
00:37:52.318 --> 00:37:53.736
No more going out at all

633
00:37:53.819 --> 00:37:57.490
unless you're...
dying or trying to get to a hospital.


634
00:37:57.573 --> 00:38:00.284
If you are ever photographed,

635
00:38:00.368 --> 00:38:04.955
you need to be disheveled and look bad.
You need to look like you're in hell.


636
00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:06.290
This <i>is</i> hell, Mea.

637
00:38:07.875 --> 00:38:10.920
I can't for the life of me understand
why Hydie would make that video.


638
00:38:13.631 --> 00:38:14.632
She was my woman.

639
00:38:16.175 --> 00:38:18.302
I feel like all this
is just a bad dream.

640
00:38:20.763 --> 00:38:21.889
I feel like maybe if I

641
00:38:23.224 --> 00:38:25.184
dove off this roof, 
I might wake up.

642
00:38:26.018 --> 00:38:27.228
You're not dreaming.

643
00:38:27.728 --> 00:38:29.647
And that... will kill you.

644
00:38:31.065 --> 00:38:33.150
Why don't we go back into the apartment?

645
00:38:33.234 --> 00:38:34.860
I'm not suicidal, girl.

646
00:38:37.071 --> 00:38:38.280
That was a lie, Mea.

647
00:38:40.783 --> 00:38:42.284
I'm not a womanizer,

648
00:38:42.868 --> 00:38:44.412
despite what the paper says.

649
00:38:47.998 --> 00:38:48.998
Yes.

650
00:38:50.626 --> 00:38:52.253
I do love sex.

651
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.674
And, yes, I have

652
00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.677
done some wild shit.

653
00:39:01.554 --> 00:39:03.013
But I've never hurt nobody.

654
00:39:07.893 --> 00:39:12.273
I'm the type of man who loves to see
pleasure on my woman's face, not pain.


655
00:39:12.773 --> 00:39:13.773
Pleasure.

656
00:39:14.191 --> 00:39:15.651
And she knows that.

657
00:39:15.734 --> 00:39:17.027
So why would she lie?

658
00:39:20.072 --> 00:39:23.868
She's not my ex. She's just someone
I was fucking around with.


659
00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:27.079
Listen, I've heard
everything I need to know.


660
00:39:27.913 --> 00:39:32.084
If there's anything else to find,
Jimmy is the best, and he will find it.


661
00:39:32.168 --> 00:39:33.168
Okay.

662
00:39:37.339 --> 00:39:38.382
Try not to worry.

663
00:40:03.491 --> 00:40:04.575
How's Mexico?

664
00:40:04.658 --> 00:40:07.786
Uh, Mexico is the same everywhere.

665
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.622
<i>Meaning how's the search going?</i>

666
00:40:10.164 --> 00:40:12.583
Not so good. I traced the cell phone

667
00:40:12.666 --> 00:40:15.336
<i>to a cell tower
near where the video was sent to,</i>


668
00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:17.713
<i>and, yeah,
there's no families living in the area.</i>


669
00:40:17.796 --> 00:40:19.381
<i>It's all cartel overran, right?</i>

670
00:40:19.465 --> 00:40:23.010
I get as close as I can to the city
where the police said that she was born.


671
00:40:23.093 --> 00:40:25.137
Nobody's ever heard of this Hydie.
Excuse me.


672
00:40:25.888 --> 00:40:28.390
- Well, that's odd.
<i>- Yeah, no, it gets worse.</i>


673
00:40:28.474 --> 00:40:32.186
Uh, there are no birth records
for anyone with that name, Mea.


674
00:40:32.269 --> 00:40:36.023
And to think, like, that an American
could kill a beautiful Mexican girl,


675
00:40:36.106 --> 00:40:38.150
and there's no sign of that story here?

676
00:40:38.234 --> 00:40:39.735
<i>C'mon, something's off.</i>

677
00:40:40.694 --> 00:40:43.197
<i>Gimme a couple days.
I'll have a full report.</i>


678
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.280
Um, okay.

679
00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:46.784
<i>Yeah, oh, and there is a...</i>

680
00:40:46.867 --> 00:40:49.620
<i>there's a Renee Carter
you really need to ask him about.</i>


681
00:40:49.703 --> 00:40:51.080
Is she on the witness list?

682
00:40:51.163 --> 00:40:54.416
Yeah, I talked to her on the phone.
She's telling me she got a lot to say,


683
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.711
but she won't talk on the phone,
so I'll see her when I get back.


684
00:40:57.795 --> 00:41:00.798
Oh, okay. Well, travel safe. Thank you.

685
00:41:00.881 --> 00:41:02.466
All right. I'll try.

686
00:41:18.857 --> 00:41:19.733
What?

687
00:41:19.817 --> 00:41:21.610
You, uh...

688
00:41:21.694 --> 00:41:23.112
...you remember our honeymoon?

689
00:41:23.862 --> 00:41:24.862
Remember?

690
00:41:25.614 --> 00:41:27.616
When it rained every damn day?

691
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:33.998
When you kept getting dressed,
and we couldn't even make it to the door?


692
00:41:46.719 --> 00:41:47.720
You, um...

693
00:41:48.762 --> 00:41:50.681
you ever think we can get back there?

694
00:41:54.768 --> 00:41:56.645
I know you can't answer that. I know.

695
00:41:58.897 --> 00:41:59.898
This is on me.

696
00:42:01.483 --> 00:42:05.446
But I promise... I promise I'm gonna do
everything to get us back there.


697
00:42:07.615 --> 00:42:08.615
Okay?

698
00:42:09.658 --> 00:42:12.494
And I get it.
Um... I know why you repped him.


699
00:42:14.079 --> 00:42:15.372
It's totally my fuck-up.

700
00:42:17.666 --> 00:42:20.169
And I'm sorry. I really am.

701
00:42:21.128 --> 00:42:22.838
I love you with everything.

702
00:42:30.512 --> 00:42:32.181
I gotta get dressed, Kal.

703
00:42:32.264 --> 00:42:34.099
Yeah. Of... of course.

704
00:42:53.118 --> 00:42:54.119
Shit.

705
00:42:54.203 --> 00:42:55.412
<i>Who is Renee Carter?</i>

706
00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.831
A very bitter person.

707
00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:00.542
Did you sleep with her?

708
00:43:02.461 --> 00:43:03.461
Yes.

709
00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.757
So is everyone you sleep with bitter?

710
00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:12.471
It may sound arrogant, but

711
00:43:13.931 --> 00:43:16.100
I know what I want,
and I know what I don't.


712
00:43:17.976 --> 00:43:19.812
Sometimes, despite what I tell them,

713
00:43:21.271 --> 00:43:23.565
they think I'll fall in love with them
and stay forever.


714
00:43:25.275 --> 00:43:27.528
She is a witness for the prosecution,

715
00:43:27.611 --> 00:43:29.738
so... tell me about her.

716
00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.573
She

717
00:43:32.783 --> 00:43:34.076
owns a gallery.

718
00:43:34.159 --> 00:43:36.745
Very well-connected in the art world.

719
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:39.081
Knows... everything

720
00:43:39.164 --> 00:43:40.332
and everyone.

721
00:43:41.291 --> 00:43:42.459
I remember

722
00:43:43.252 --> 00:43:45.337
bringing one of my paintings to her

723
00:43:45.421 --> 00:43:47.339
after going to everyone in the city.

724
00:43:48.465 --> 00:43:49.883
They all said no.

725
00:43:50.759 --> 00:43:52.219
She took one look at me...

726
00:43:56.765 --> 00:43:57.975
and said yes.

727
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:04.481
Didn't even look at the work.

728
00:44:05.357 --> 00:44:06.942
It was obvious what she wanted.

729
00:44:09.903 --> 00:44:13.282
She put all my paintings up.
Took me around the country.


730
00:44:14.825 --> 00:44:16.201
Pretty much got me started.

731
00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:20.080
I was young.

732
00:44:20.873 --> 00:44:22.833
I was broke. I was desperate.

733
00:44:25.002 --> 00:44:26.128
I wasn't using her.

734
00:44:27.755 --> 00:44:28.881
I really liked her.

735
00:44:32.217 --> 00:44:34.011
We just had nothing in common.

736
00:44:35.804 --> 00:44:38.974
So, once I got a little traction,
I told her I was moving out.


737
00:44:41.185 --> 00:44:42.436
She got furious.

738
00:44:44.772 --> 00:44:46.064
Wanted to control me.

739
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:51.570
I didn't like it.

740
00:45:00.162 --> 00:45:01.162
You can relate?

741
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:06.502
Mr. Malloy...

742
00:45:08.837 --> 00:45:11.840
You may as well tell me.
My life is in your hands.


743
00:45:14.676 --> 00:45:17.095
Do you wanna die of lethal injection?

744
00:45:19.223 --> 00:45:20.516
Stay focused.

745
00:45:21.934 --> 00:45:23.060
I am your attorney.

746
00:45:23.143 --> 00:45:24.686
I am not your friend.

747
00:45:35.572 --> 00:45:37.491
No one returns my calls anymore.

748
00:45:42.996 --> 00:45:45.040
I'm sorry. Where was I at? I'm sorry.

749
00:45:57.344 --> 00:45:58.762
I got married young

750
00:45:59.263 --> 00:46:00.764
to a man that I loved.

751
00:46:03.267 --> 00:46:05.686
It wasn't the fairy tale
that I thought it would be.


752
00:46:07.479 --> 00:46:09.565
Her taking care of you is...

753
00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:14.695
something that I can... sort of relate to.

754
00:46:29.585 --> 00:46:32.546
All right,
I think that's enough for tonight.


755
00:46:32.629 --> 00:46:33.881
Wait, wait, wait.

756
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.091
Hold on. No, no, no, no.

757
00:46:36.174 --> 00:46:37.885
Come here. Come here.

758
00:46:38.385 --> 00:46:40.929
- Oh, no, I...
- Come! Come here.


759
00:46:41.013 --> 00:46:42.806
Please. Just for a minute.

760
00:46:44.391 --> 00:46:46.393
Please. Come here.

761
00:46:47.394 --> 00:46:49.271
Sit down. I wanna show you something.

762
00:46:49.354 --> 00:46:50.397
Sit down.

763
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400
Sit.

764
00:46:58.864 --> 00:47:00.198
Close your eyes.

765
00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.450
Close.

766
00:47:11.668 --> 00:47:14.296
First color that comes to mind
when you think of your marriage.


767
00:47:14.379 --> 00:47:16.465
I don't think so.

768
00:47:17.591 --> 00:47:19.468
Relax. Tell me.

769
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:26.849
Blue.

770
00:47:34.107 --> 00:47:35.107
Close.

771
00:47:37.486 --> 00:47:38.486
There you go.

772
00:47:56.755 --> 00:47:58.423
What do you see the blue making?

773
00:47:59.675 --> 00:48:00.675
Waves?

774
00:48:01.259 --> 00:48:02.259
Waves.

775
00:48:02.886 --> 00:48:05.263
Just let it go. 
Paint the wave.

776
00:48:06.723 --> 00:48:09.017
That's it. Very nice.

777
00:48:09.518 --> 00:48:10.852
I don't wanna do this.

778
00:48:12.437 --> 00:48:13.437
Trust.

779
00:48:16.191 --> 00:48:17.317
Art is subjective.

780
00:48:20.237 --> 00:48:21.405
I think it's beautiful.

781
00:48:26.785 --> 00:48:29.329
I think that's enough for tonight.

782
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.498
I'm gonna miss my train.

783
00:48:32.416 --> 00:48:33.625
Train to where?

784
00:48:37.379 --> 00:48:41.258
I see. It's... kinda hard to trust
a cat on trial for murder.


785
00:48:44.344 --> 00:48:45.595
I live in Chesterton.

786
00:48:47.431 --> 00:48:49.111
Come.
I'll take you to the station.


787
00:49:08.952 --> 00:49:10.245
Oh, no.

788
00:49:10.746 --> 00:49:12.205
I thought you had a car.

789
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:14.082
I do. This is faster.

790
00:49:15.208 --> 00:49:16.376
I don't think so.

791
00:49:17.252 --> 00:49:18.086
Why?

792
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:19.546
Well, for one,

793
00:49:20.255 --> 00:49:21.465
I have on a skirt.

794
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:23.090
So hike it up.

795
00:49:24.009 --> 00:49:25.927
That does not seem appropriate.

796
00:49:26.011 --> 00:49:27.804
You always do what's appropriate?

797
00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:34.770
- Come on, man, just ride side-saddle.
- That does not seem safe.


798
00:49:34.853 --> 00:49:36.772
You always do what's safe?

799
00:49:39.483 --> 00:49:42.235
I got a car.
Come on, it's right here. Come on.


800
00:49:43.528 --> 00:49:47.240
- My ride is pulling up right about now.
- I'll walk you.


801
00:49:48.241 --> 00:49:50.035
No, no. Thank you.

802
00:50:01.922 --> 00:50:03.381
<i>Come on, please.</i>

803
00:50:04.007 --> 00:50:06.051
Don't question it.

804
00:50:06.802 --> 00:50:07.803
Just let it go.

805
00:50:09.721 --> 00:50:11.098
I think it's beautiful.

806
00:50:12.641 --> 00:50:14.101
<i>I don't wanna do this.</i>

807
00:50:14.601 --> 00:50:15.685
<i>Don't think.</i>

808
00:50:16.645 --> 00:50:17.645
Close your eyes.

809
00:50:19.523 --> 00:50:20.732
This is wonderful.

810
00:51:17.706 --> 00:51:20.333
I'm really looking forward
to getting all the information.


811
00:51:20.417 --> 00:51:21.668
- Can you do that?
- On it.


812
00:51:21.751 --> 00:51:22.961
Okay, by Thursday.

813
00:51:23.044 --> 00:51:25.172
- Sounds good. All right. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.


814
00:51:25.255 --> 00:51:27.674
Thursday. Make it Thursday.
Okay. Thank you.


815
00:51:27.757 --> 00:51:28.757
Mea.

816
00:51:32.596 --> 00:51:34.097
- Hi.
- Hey. Um...


817
00:51:34.181 --> 00:51:37.309
You left so early this morning,
I didn't get a chance.


818
00:51:38.351 --> 00:51:40.604
I... Uh, thank you. 
I have a lot to do.

819
00:51:40.687 --> 00:51:43.023
I know. I just told you
I wouldn't stop trying.


820
00:51:47.277 --> 00:51:48.277
Thank you.

821
00:51:49.196 --> 00:51:52.199
Well, uh, I was just coming
to drop these off. I'll, uh...


822
00:51:55.243 --> 00:51:56.828
Look, I was thinkin', uh...

823
00:51:57.579 --> 00:52:00.332
How about dinner tonight?
No, after therapy.


824
00:52:01.958 --> 00:52:02.958
Okay.

825
00:52:04.419 --> 00:52:05.419
Mea.

826
00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:08.965
Must be your husband.

827
00:52:09.466 --> 00:52:10.466
Zyair.

828
00:52:12.677 --> 00:52:14.554
There's no need for the introduction.

829
00:52:21.603 --> 00:52:23.188
Wow.

830
00:52:24.147 --> 00:52:26.858
- My office?
- What happened to meeting at my loft?


831
00:52:27.692 --> 00:52:30.403
I thought it would be better
if we meet here instead,


832
00:52:30.487 --> 00:52:31.988
just to stay focused.

833
00:52:33.198 --> 00:52:34.198
I get it.

834
00:52:34.532 --> 00:52:37.452
So let's go to my office
to discuss the gallery owner.


835
00:52:37.535 --> 00:52:39.746
You know, the paps followed me
all the way here.


836
00:52:43.416 --> 00:52:44.417
I'm sorry.

837
00:52:44.501 --> 00:52:47.504
I thought that was the whole reason
for meeting at my place.


838
00:52:48.463 --> 00:52:51.174
Well, this... is better.

839
00:52:52.467 --> 00:52:54.469
Better... for who?

840
00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:57.389
I'm trying to do
a good job for you.

841
00:52:58.265 --> 00:52:59.516
That's bullshit.

842
00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:00.809
Excuse me?

843
00:53:00.892 --> 00:53:04.104
I don't wanna be here.
This place is... uptight.


844
00:53:04.187 --> 00:53:07.274
Niggas in suits,
and I don't feel I can open up here.


845
00:53:07.357 --> 00:53:09.442
Meet me at my loft. 
It's so much better.

846
00:53:10.318 --> 00:53:11.861
Are you taking this seriously?

847
00:53:12.529 --> 00:53:13.613
Are <i>you?</i>

848
00:53:15.615 --> 00:53:16.783
Meet me at my loft.

849
00:53:17.367 --> 00:53:20.203
Mr. Malloy, are you really leaving?

850
00:53:20.287 --> 00:53:22.956
By the way, I... see them jeans.

851
00:53:33.883 --> 00:53:36.261
<i>♪ Hello, it's me ♪</i>

852
00:53:37.595 --> 00:53:38.805
<i>♪ It's me, babe ♪</i>

853
00:53:39.764 --> 00:53:43.351
<i>♪ I've thought about us
For a long, long time ♪</i>


854
00:53:45.145 --> 00:53:50.191
<i>♪ Maybe I think too much
But something's wrong ♪</i>


855
00:53:51.484 --> 00:53:55.947
<i>♪ Somethin' here
That doesn't last too long ♪</i>


856
00:53:57.115 --> 00:54:00.410
<i>♪ Maybe I shouldn't think of you... ♪</i>

857
00:54:00.493 --> 00:54:01.493
You're a day late.

858
00:54:01.536 --> 00:54:03.496
I shouldn't be here at all.

859
00:54:04.581 --> 00:54:07.459
- I wanna talk about the other night.
- Mr. Malloy, <i>I</i> don't.


860
00:54:07.542 --> 00:54:08.877
Good. Then listen.

861
00:54:09.377 --> 00:54:10.503
I find you

862
00:54:11.379 --> 00:54:12.964
incredibly attractive.

863
00:54:13.965 --> 00:54:15.550
You turn me on when I see you.

864
00:54:20.263 --> 00:54:22.098
I hug you when I see you because

865
00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:24.768
I love the way you feel.

866
00:54:26.144 --> 00:54:28.938
Love the way the small of your back feels
in my hands.


867
00:54:29.689 --> 00:54:30.774
The way you smell.

868
00:54:31.816 --> 00:54:32.859
Your brilliance.

869
00:54:33.985 --> 00:54:35.153
Your confidence.

870
00:54:35.236 --> 00:54:37.947
All... very intriguing,

871
00:54:38.698 --> 00:54:39.824
very attractive.

872
00:54:50.752 --> 00:54:53.088
"Mr. Malloy, the sex murderer."

873
00:54:54.255 --> 00:54:57.175
"Zyair Malloy, an arrogant murderer."

874
00:54:57.258 --> 00:55:01.721
"Zyair Malloy killed his girlfriend
so his paintings would go up in value."


875
00:55:02.555 --> 00:55:04.474
"Malloy, the womanizer!"

876
00:55:05.016 --> 00:55:09.979
"Zyair Malloy, he makes women
fall for him and then kills them."


877
00:55:10.939 --> 00:55:12.232
I could go on and on.

878
00:55:12.732 --> 00:55:16.569
So you think I'm running game?
That's what you think of me?


879
00:55:16.653 --> 00:55:19.739
Doesn't matter what I think.
It's what the jury thinks.


880
00:55:19.823 --> 00:55:23.618
So I tell you that I'm attracted to you,
and you throw this bullshit in my face?


881
00:55:24.494 --> 00:55:25.954
I think I need a new lawyer

882
00:55:26.037 --> 00:55:29.332
because everything in your body
says you're attracted to me.


883
00:55:29.416 --> 00:55:32.043
But you won't admit it to yourself
or to me.


884
00:55:34.254 --> 00:55:35.338
I can't trust you.

885
00:55:36.631 --> 00:55:37.631
New lawyer.

886
00:55:38.049 --> 00:55:39.884
If that's what you want to do.

887
00:55:39.968 --> 00:55:42.762
But I'll just say this.
Your trial is in a month.


888
00:55:44.222 --> 00:55:48.101
And that'll be hard for any attorney
to get up to speed in such short time.


889
00:55:48.184 --> 00:55:50.270
Admit it. You find me attractive.

890
00:55:53.273 --> 00:55:54.273
That is a lie.

891
00:55:55.275 --> 00:55:56.943
I'm here to try to help you.

892
00:55:57.026 --> 00:55:59.070
Lying to me isn't helping me, Mea.

893
00:56:00.321 --> 00:56:03.158
You have my life in your hands
and can't admit a simple truth.


894
00:56:03.658 --> 00:56:06.286
Mr. Malloy, I can smell the marijuana.

895
00:56:06.369 --> 00:56:08.538
I could smell it
when you came to my office.


896
00:56:08.621 --> 00:56:10.039
I know that you're high,

897
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:11.916
and it's not helping.

898
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.211
Well, being high brings truth.
Maybe you should try it.


899
00:56:16.796 --> 00:56:17.796
Yeah.

900
00:56:18.256 --> 00:56:19.256
New lawyer.

901
00:56:39.861 --> 00:56:41.112
Where are you going?

902
00:56:41.196 --> 00:56:43.281
I need to dance. 
I'm going out.

903
00:56:44.073 --> 00:56:46.201
You cannot be seen
in public dancing.


904
00:56:46.284 --> 00:56:50.497
Where I'm going isn't public.
Get your shit. Let's go. I gotta lock up.


905
00:56:52.665 --> 00:56:54.250
Mea. Move!

906
00:57:10.725 --> 00:57:13.228
So is this what you do
when you don't get your way?


907
00:57:13.937 --> 00:57:17.232
Only person who could help me
won't tell me she's attracted to me


908
00:57:17.315 --> 00:57:20.193
or that she believes me.
And I know you are.


909
00:57:21.528 --> 00:57:23.655
I see your breathing change
when I look at you.


910
00:57:23.738 --> 00:57:25.990
Or how you avert your eyes
when I look at you.


911
00:57:27.116 --> 00:57:28.409
Trying to play cool.

912
00:57:29.953 --> 00:57:30.954
Play big girl.

913
00:57:33.748 --> 00:57:34.958
I see you, big girl.

914
00:57:36.209 --> 00:57:38.169
You shouldn't be seen going out.

915
00:57:38.962 --> 00:57:40.672
I told you, I'm not going out.

916
00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.600
Wanna fuck?

917
00:59:59.102 --> 01:00:00.102
I got X.

918
01:00:06.359 --> 01:00:09.362
All right, watch this.
I'm coming for you. Mm-hmm.


919
01:00:10.238 --> 01:00:12.156
Okay, one-on-one.

920
01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.701
All right, then,
why you running? Don't run!


921
01:00:14.784 --> 01:00:16.953
Okay, watch this. Here you go.

922
01:00:17.036 --> 01:00:18.836
- Hey.
- Oh, I see you know how to hide.


923
01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:21.040
Okay, where you at?
Oh, you think you smart?


924
01:00:21.124 --> 01:00:23.710
You think you smart. Okay... Come on!

925
01:00:25.962 --> 01:00:28.673
Come on, that's not fair. Look... Uh...

926
01:00:29.215 --> 01:00:31.801
All right, okay. C'mon, then.
One-on-one, let's go.


927
01:00:32.468 --> 01:00:35.805
Oh, you think you smart.
All right, let's go now. Okay, wait there.


928
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:39.058
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

929
01:00:39.726 --> 01:00:40.726
Okay, let's go.

930
01:00:52.196 --> 01:00:54.073
- This is Mea.
<i>- It's Maddy.</i>


931
01:00:54.824 --> 01:00:55.658
Hi.

932
01:00:55.742 --> 01:00:59.287
<i>Hi. Zyair told me he want another lawyer.</i>

933
01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:00.955
Yes.

934
01:01:01.038 --> 01:01:05.460
<i>I told him that would be a big mistake.
Please, talk to him.</i>


935
01:01:05.543 --> 01:01:06.961
<i>He doesn't want me to.</i>

936
01:01:07.044 --> 01:01:09.505
<i>Mea, he is scared out of his mind.</i>

937
01:01:10.173 --> 01:01:12.842
<i>- He said that?
- Well, there you have it.</i>


938
01:01:12.925 --> 01:01:16.679
<i>He would never admit that to anyone.
Don't give up on him. He needs you.</i>


939
01:01:17.889 --> 01:01:19.557
<i>Maddy, I really have to go.</i>

940
01:01:24.187 --> 01:01:26.189
Maddy told me you wanted to see me.

941
01:01:26.773 --> 01:01:28.983
I wanna apologize about the other night.

942
01:01:30.234 --> 01:01:31.903
I know this is hard for you.

943
01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:33.738
Yes.

944
01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:35.573
I wanted to say that first.

945
01:01:36.657 --> 01:01:42.580
Zyair, I am not... some weak woman
that you can... seduce.


946
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.125
Yes, my marriage has issues, as do most,

947
01:01:46.209 --> 01:01:48.669
but... we will work it out.

948
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:52.507
And if you wanna fire me, that's fine.

949
01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:54.926
But you won't find anyone better

950
01:01:55.635 --> 01:01:58.304
or anyone who cares as much.

951
01:02:00.097 --> 01:02:03.184
I was just trying to set some boundaries,
that's all.


952
01:02:04.811 --> 01:02:05.978
There's some truth.

953
01:02:07.772 --> 01:02:09.398
Why do you need boundaries?

954
01:02:24.372 --> 01:02:27.458
Um, call me tomorrow
if you want me to represent you.


955
01:02:34.507 --> 01:02:35.507
Hi.

956
01:02:36.259 --> 01:02:37.260
I'm Carrie.

957
01:02:38.302 --> 01:02:39.428
I live next door.

958
01:02:40.012 --> 01:02:43.015
There's no need
to introduce yourself. She's not staying.


959
01:04:23.741 --> 01:04:24.575
Hi.

960
01:04:24.659 --> 01:04:25.952
Been trying to call you.

961
01:04:27.912 --> 01:04:29.246
It's been a long day.

962
01:04:31.207 --> 01:04:32.291
What's wrong?

963
01:04:33.376 --> 01:04:35.878
Nothing. N... Nothing. 
Uh, what you got?

964
01:04:36.545 --> 01:04:38.464
Is this about Kal and that girl?

965
01:04:39.924 --> 01:04:41.300
What are you talking about?

966
01:04:41.384 --> 01:04:42.969
Shit.

967
01:04:45.221 --> 01:04:46.847
<i>What is it?</i>

968
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:48.516
Check your phone.

969
01:04:54.146 --> 01:04:56.899
<i>Hey, I... I am sorry, kid, okay?</i>

970
01:04:56.983 --> 01:04:59.694
<i>But they're at the Winston, room 714.</i>

971
01:05:00.778 --> 01:05:02.488
<i>Are you there?</i>

972
01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.616
<i>Mea? All right, listen, Mea.</i>

973
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.536
I'm back tomorrow, all right,
and I'm coming to you, Mea.


974
01:05:08.619 --> 01:05:10.621
I'm coming right to you, okay? Just...

975
01:05:10.705 --> 01:05:12.873
<i>Hey, hey, listen. 
Can you talk to me?</i>

976
01:05:14.417 --> 01:05:18.295
- I'll call you back. I'll call you back.
- Please. Just take a breath, okay?


977
01:05:18.963 --> 01:05:20.798
<i>I'll be by my phone.</i>

Zyair.

No worries.

1033
01:11:16.779 --> 01:11:17.946
It's abstraction.

1034
01:11:33.379 --> 01:11:34.380
Oh shit.

1035
01:11:35.172 --> 01:11:36.172
Come on.

1036
01:11:40.052 --> 01:11:42.388
I always saw myself
with a woman like you.

1037
01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:44.723
Honestly,

1038
01:11:45.224 --> 01:11:48.102
I always saw myself
with someone spontaneous.


1039
01:11:49.228 --> 01:11:52.356
Who makes love to me
the way I wanna be made love to.


1040
01:11:53.565 --> 01:11:55.651
Who throws caution at the wind.

1041
01:11:57.403 --> 01:11:58.529
Someone like...

1042
01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:00.530
Me?

1043
01:12:05.285 --> 01:12:06.912
Too bad we didn't meet earlier.

1044
01:12:08.288 --> 01:12:10.040
Maybe you wouldn't be with him.

1045
01:12:10.874 --> 01:12:12.626
And I wouldn't be in all this shit.

1046
01:12:14.545 --> 01:12:15.671
Where would we be?

1047
01:12:18.006 --> 01:12:21.176
Somewhere in love
in the Dominican Republic.


1048
01:12:22.219 --> 01:12:24.221
Off the beach in one of those villas.

1049
01:12:26.557 --> 01:12:27.975
That sounds perfect.

1050
01:12:29.977 --> 01:12:31.478
We'll go when you get me off.

1051
01:12:33.981 --> 01:12:35.065
I'll do my best.

1052
01:12:38.235 --> 01:12:41.822
Tell me... we'll go...
when you get me off.

1053
01:12:45.284 --> 01:12:46.284
We'll go

1054
01:12:47.619 --> 01:12:48.871
when I get you off.

1055
01:13:10.726 --> 01:13:12.311
What the fuck? 
Where have you been?

1056
01:13:12.394 --> 01:13:14.480
We have been calling you all night
and all morning.


1057
01:13:14.563 --> 01:13:17.524
Keep your voices down.
We are in my office.


1058
01:13:17.608 --> 01:13:21.653
Yes, I worked very late last night,
so... I got a hotel.


1059
01:13:22.237 --> 01:13:24.990
What? And you didn't call me?
Mea, I don't like this.


1060
01:13:25.073 --> 01:13:27.242
- Neither do I, Kal.
- I don't like this at all!


1061
01:13:27.326 --> 01:13:29.929
- Keep your voice...
- Who the fuck you think you're talking to?


1062
01:13:29.953 --> 01:13:33.457
Um, she's right. 
We <i>are</i> at her job.

1063
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.294
And now that we know she's okay,
we can leave. Let's go to the Winston.


1064
01:13:38.754 --> 01:13:39.755
The Winston?

1065
01:13:39.838 --> 01:13:43.842
Azalia said she was feeling very bad,
so we moved her into the Winston


1066
01:13:43.926 --> 01:13:47.137
so that she can be closer to the hospital
since we're so far out.


1067
01:13:47.971 --> 01:13:49.264
We were all there.

1068
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.310
- What room?
- Oh.


1069
01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:55.103
So now you wanna know.

1070
01:13:57.356 --> 01:13:58.356
714.

1071
01:14:00.025 --> 01:14:01.568
Come on, Kal. Let's go.

1072
01:14:01.652 --> 01:14:03.820
I'll, um... I'll meet you in the car.

1073
01:14:10.994 --> 01:14:14.581
You really hate me that much,
you ignore me? Shoot, Mea, I'm tryin'!


1074
01:14:15.457 --> 01:14:16.457
What the hell?

1075
01:14:18.085 --> 01:14:22.005
Look, we're in counseling.
Look, I thought we were doing better.


1076
01:14:23.507 --> 01:14:25.092
Please tell me what's goin' on.

1077
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:29.470
I'm sorry.

1078
01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640
You're sorry.

1079
01:14:33.642 --> 01:14:35.018
That's all you have to say?

1080
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.230
Can we go to my office and talk?

1081
01:14:38.313 --> 01:14:40.274
No, I'm good right here. 
In fact, uh...

1082
01:14:42.651 --> 01:14:43.819
I can't do this.

1083
01:14:45.195 --> 01:14:46.195
Kal.

1084
01:14:48.657 --> 01:14:49.950
Shit.

1085
01:14:55.289 --> 01:14:56.289
Shit.

1086
01:15:09.469 --> 01:15:11.096
Haven't heard from you all day.

1087
01:15:14.224 --> 01:15:15.934
- I brought your case files.
- Mea.


1088
01:15:16.018 --> 01:15:18.228
The rest will be delivered later on.

1089
01:15:19.688 --> 01:15:22.441
I spoke to Jason Timsdale. He is great.

1090
01:15:23.025 --> 01:15:25.736
I spoke to him this morning.
He has an excellent team.


1091
01:15:25.819 --> 01:15:27.988
- Stop.
- And they are ready to take you on.


1092
01:15:28.488 --> 01:15:29.488
Stop.

1093
01:15:30.073 --> 01:15:33.076
I understand. You're feeling guilty.

1094
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.536
You're embarrassed.

1095
01:15:35.245 --> 01:15:36.371
You wanna avoid me.

1096
01:15:37.623 --> 01:15:39.416
I get it. I already know.

1097
01:15:40.876 --> 01:15:42.711
There's no reason for any of that.

1098
01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.420
No one

1099
01:15:45.756 --> 01:15:46.756
will ever know.

1100
01:15:49.593 --> 01:15:50.593
Look...

1101
01:15:52.804 --> 01:15:55.015
I saw that wall you had up
when we first met.


1102
01:15:55.891 --> 01:15:57.267
I knew you were feeling me.

1103
01:15:59.394 --> 01:16:04.650
But that woman who can hide her emotions
in the workplace,


1104
01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.360
she can rep me.

1105
01:16:08.403 --> 01:16:11.365
I know you can do it.
You can separate the two.


1106
01:16:11.448 --> 01:16:13.617
Do you wanna gamble with your life?

1107
01:16:14.117 --> 01:16:15.702
Knowing how you feel about me?

1108
01:16:16.411 --> 01:16:17.746
Absolutely.

1109
01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:24.378
What's more important to me right now

1110
01:16:26.004 --> 01:16:27.881
is how I feel about my husband.

1111
01:16:29.257 --> 01:16:30.967
- And I can't do this.
- Mea.


1112
01:16:31.718 --> 01:16:33.845
- I won't do this.
- Mea, please.


1113
01:16:33.929 --> 01:16:37.057
It's too late. You know I need you.
You <i>know</i> I need you.


1114
01:16:38.892 --> 01:16:40.143
Please don't do this.

1115
01:16:43.772 --> 01:16:44.772
I can't.

1116
01:16:48.276 --> 01:16:49.276
Mea!

1117
01:16:53.448 --> 01:16:55.117
Mea, what am I supposed to do?

1118
01:17:00.706 --> 01:17:02.624
I can't believe
I did it, Jimmy.


1119
01:17:02.708 --> 01:17:04.835
But you're human, okay?

1120
01:17:04.918 --> 01:17:06.795
She was in there 'cause she was sick.

1121
01:17:06.878 --> 01:17:09.506
They were all in there!
Ray and Charlise too.


1122
01:17:09.589 --> 01:17:12.134
I would never judge you,
and you know that, right?


1123
01:17:12.217 --> 01:17:13.760
But I'm judging myself.

1124
01:17:15.512 --> 01:17:16.972
I was so stupid!

1125
01:17:17.055 --> 01:17:19.725
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- It's not your fault.


1126
01:17:20.225 --> 01:17:22.102
Don't beat yourself up, okay?

1127
01:17:22.894 --> 01:17:24.187
I can't rep him.

1128
01:17:24.271 --> 01:17:25.707
- No, no, no.
- But I need the money.


1129
01:17:25.731 --> 01:17:27.482
No, no. We're not gonna panic.

1130
01:17:27.566 --> 01:17:30.986
You have handled a
lot. You got this, Mea.

1131
01:17:31.069 --> 01:17:33.780
You can do it.
Don't you lose this because of my mistake.


1132
01:17:34.614 --> 01:17:36.158
How do I look at him?

1133
01:17:36.241 --> 01:17:38.243
You... can do this.

1134
01:17:38.326 --> 01:17:41.621
You take a second,
but you can do this. All right?


1135
01:17:42.122 --> 01:17:43.707
You just talk to the gallery owner.

1136
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:46.126
She refused to talk to me,
but for whatever reason,


1137
01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:47.753
she said she's willing to talk to you.

1138
01:17:47.836 --> 01:17:50.464
If you still feel like you can't,
then you drop it.


1139
01:17:50.964 --> 01:17:52.591
But you gotta try. Okay?

1140
01:17:52.674 --> 01:17:53.550
- Okay.
- All right?


1141
01:17:53.633 --> 01:17:54.676
- Okay.
- All right.


1142
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:55.760
Okay.

1143
01:18:01.224 --> 01:18:04.561
Her blood! Your walls!
Her blood! Your walls!


1144
01:18:04.644 --> 01:18:08.064
Her blood! Your walls!
Her blood! Your walls!


1145
01:18:08.148 --> 01:18:11.526
Her blood! Your walls!
Her blood! Your walls!


1146
01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:13.153
Her blood! Your walls!

1147
01:18:21.036 --> 01:18:25.707
Your walls! Her blood! Your walls!
Her blood! Your walls!


1148
01:18:25.791 --> 01:18:28.794
Her blood! Your walls!
Her blood! Your walls!


1149
01:18:28.877 --> 01:18:31.254
Her blood! Your walls!
Her blood! Your walls!


1150
01:18:31.338 --> 01:18:34.841
All you bitches can go to hell!

1151
01:18:35.967 --> 01:18:37.219
Take that.

1152
01:18:37.302 --> 01:18:40.013
Her blood! Your walls! Her blood...

1153
01:19:09.251 --> 01:19:12.546
Are you gonna stand there,
or are you gonna come have a seat?


1154
01:19:24.099 --> 01:19:25.350
You want one?

1155
01:19:25.851 --> 01:19:26.852
No, thank you!

1156
01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:33.024
Are you judging me
because it's before noon?


1157
01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:35.151
Not at all.

1158
01:19:36.653 --> 01:19:37.654
Well,

1159
01:19:38.655 --> 01:19:39.906
I've earned this.

1160
01:19:41.783 --> 01:19:44.369
I'm Renee Chester Wilson.

1161
01:19:44.995 --> 01:19:45.996
Mea Harper.

1162
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:48.498
I know who you are.

1163
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.334
He likes you!

1164
01:19:53.879 --> 01:19:55.255
You fuckin' him yet?

1165
01:19:55.338 --> 01:19:56.923
I beg your pardon?

1166
01:19:57.007 --> 01:19:58.300
Yeah, you are.

1167
01:19:59.217 --> 01:20:00.260
He's good.

1168
01:20:01.678 --> 01:20:05.807
And he has a real sizable package,
like the snake that he is.


1169
01:20:06.308 --> 01:20:08.226
<i>You</i> wanted to talk to me.

1170
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:13.189
Yes, honey.
I wanted to share with you who he is.


1171
01:20:13.273 --> 01:20:14.816
Look at these walls.

1172
01:20:17.152 --> 01:20:20.280
There's Basquiat, Warhol,

1173
01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:22.532
Jon Moody,

1174
01:20:22.616 --> 01:20:24.075
Sam Gilliam,

1175
01:20:24.159 --> 01:20:25.535
Mark Bradford,

1176
01:20:25.619 --> 01:20:26.828
and Derrick Adams.

1177
01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:29.331
He didn't belong on these walls.

1178
01:20:30.874 --> 01:20:34.461
Those bitches out there want me
to get rid of all of his paintings.


1179
01:20:34.544 --> 01:20:35.837
Not a chance.

1180
01:20:36.338 --> 01:20:38.340
He's gonna make me rich one day.

1181
01:20:39.925 --> 01:20:40.925
Well,

1182
01:20:41.635 --> 01:20:43.345
rich... er.

1183
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:46.556
I helped him.

1184
01:20:47.682 --> 01:20:50.560
And as soon as things
started going well for him,


1185
01:20:50.644 --> 01:20:54.439
it was bye-bye, old broad.

1186
01:20:55.774 --> 01:20:57.275
The world awaits.

1187
01:20:59.277 --> 01:21:03.615
I can... understand
how that kind of betrayal can feel.


1188
01:21:03.698 --> 01:21:07.786
You can't understand nothing.
You're not even 50. You have no idea.


1189
01:21:07.869 --> 01:21:11.164
Well, with that being said,

1190
01:21:12.666 --> 01:21:14.668
is there anything else you wanna say?

1191
01:21:14.751 --> 01:21:17.629
There's a lot I can say, sugar.
What do you wanna know?


1192
01:21:18.254 --> 01:21:21.299
Was he ever violent towards you?

1193
01:21:24.427 --> 01:21:25.762
You're going there.

1194
01:21:25.845 --> 01:21:27.597
I don't understand.

1195
01:21:27.681 --> 01:21:31.601
I... If you wanna defend him
in that way, okay.


1196
01:21:31.685 --> 01:21:34.479
No, he was never violent.

1197
01:21:35.188 --> 01:21:37.649
But that's not how a snake works.

1198
01:21:37.732 --> 01:21:42.153
A snake is never violent...
when they're stalking their prey.


1199
01:21:42.237 --> 01:21:46.157
It's only when they get
right into striking distance


1200
01:21:46.783 --> 01:21:49.995
that they can become very... violent.

1201
01:21:50.495 --> 01:21:53.164
Was he ever
within striking distance with you?


1202
01:21:55.291 --> 01:21:56.291
No.

1203
01:21:57.127 --> 01:21:59.462
He got what he
wanted, and he was gone.

1204
01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:01.881
He charmed me.

1205
01:22:01.965 --> 01:22:04.759
I told him I
was angry with my ex,

1206
01:22:04.843 --> 01:22:09.723
and he sat me down
in front of an easel

1207
01:22:10.807 --> 01:22:13.601
and made me paint.

1208
01:22:14.686 --> 01:22:19.733
He said, "Close your eyes,
and tell me what color you feel."


1209
01:22:20.567 --> 01:22:21.776
So I said,

1210
01:22:23.445 --> 01:22:24.445
"Blue."

1211
01:22:25.405 --> 01:22:28.241
And he made me paint waves.

1212
01:22:29.659 --> 01:22:31.036
Then he asked me,

1213
01:22:32.787 --> 01:22:34.330
"Are you angry?"

1214
01:22:34.414 --> 01:22:36.541
And I said, "Yes."

1215
01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:38.418
And then he said,

1216
01:22:38.501 --> 01:22:41.337
"Well, that feels like red to me."

1217
01:22:41.421 --> 01:22:43.089
So there I was

1218
01:22:44.424 --> 01:22:47.260
with this canvas of blue waves...

1219
01:22:49.721 --> 01:22:51.222
and red lines.

1220
01:22:51.765 --> 01:22:54.392
It was a mess. 
And you know what he did?

1221
01:22:55.685 --> 01:22:56.728
No, I don't.

1222
01:23:03.401 --> 01:23:04.527
He finished it.

1223
01:23:07.822 --> 01:23:12.410
And he put it on
the canopy over the bed.

1224
01:23:13.703 --> 01:23:15.163
And one morning,

1225
01:23:15.246 --> 01:23:18.166
I looked up, and there was my face.

1226
01:23:19.125 --> 01:23:20.668
Bigger than life.

1227
01:23:22.962 --> 01:23:24.547
I was the canvas

1228
01:23:25.465 --> 01:23:27.801
that he played with until it was done.

1229
01:23:28.802 --> 01:23:30.970
But there are many canvases.

1230
01:23:32.555 --> 01:23:35.600
Many... layers, darling.

1231
01:23:40.396 --> 01:23:41.773
Look at your face.

1232
01:24:30.572 --> 01:24:32.240
- Hey.
- Hey.


1233
01:24:34.075 --> 01:24:35.493
I've been calling you.

1234
01:24:36.244 --> 01:24:37.412
Yeah, I was out.

1235
01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:42.791
You know...

1236
01:24:44.669 --> 01:24:46.129
feeling good about all this.

1237
01:24:46.963 --> 01:24:48.089
It's all your fault.

1238
01:25:11.321 --> 01:25:13.823
I haven't felt relaxed like this
in a long time.


1239
01:25:22.415 --> 01:25:23.541
Baby, you all right?

1240
01:25:27.795 --> 01:25:28.795
Mea?

1241
01:25:34.302 --> 01:25:35.302
Mea, wait!

1242
01:25:47.273 --> 01:25:49.943
Hold on, it's not what you think.
Mea, please.


1243
01:25:51.027 --> 01:25:54.739
- Let me explain. It's not what you think.
- You need another lawyer! I quit!


1244
01:25:54.822 --> 01:25:56.741
I only did that because of the video.

1245
01:25:57.659 --> 01:25:58.659
I'm done.

1246
01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:02.330
Mea, please.
You know it's too late.


1247
01:26:02.413 --> 01:26:04.749
I need you, M... Oh my God...

1248
01:26:07.835 --> 01:26:09.712
So you take down the painting of me,

1249
01:26:09.796 --> 01:26:13.174
painted that "die, bitch,
you ruined my life," and put it back up?


1250
01:26:13.258 --> 01:26:16.511
It's not what you think.
What do you want me to do, Mea?


1251
01:26:17.303 --> 01:26:18.638
What do you want me to do?

1252
01:26:20.974 --> 01:26:21.974
Mea.

1253
01:26:26.187 --> 01:26:27.187
Mea.

1254
01:26:29.482 --> 01:26:31.693
- Start the elevator!
- Mea.


1255
01:26:31.776 --> 01:26:32.819
Start it!

1256
01:26:32.902 --> 01:26:34.404
What we had the other night...

1257
01:26:35.029 --> 01:26:36.281
Start the elevator.

1258
01:26:37.699 --> 01:26:39.575
I only have one card to play.

1259
01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:50.420
If you are talking about
telling my husband, <i>I</i> will tell him.


1260
01:26:50.503 --> 01:26:54.340
I'll go to the prosecution,
Judge Brodan, the bar.


1261
01:26:54.424 --> 01:26:58.011
That painting is enough to bury your ass!

1262
01:26:58.094 --> 01:27:00.930
- That's not what I'm saying.
- The fuck are you saying?!


1263
01:27:01.514 --> 01:27:02.765
Just that I love you.

1264
01:27:04.642 --> 01:27:06.311
You are so full of shit.

1265
01:27:22.410 --> 01:27:24.704
Start the fucking elevator.

1266
01:27:26.789 --> 01:27:28.708
Start the fucking elevator!

1267
01:27:49.228 --> 01:27:50.605
Hey. What's goin' on?

1268
01:27:56.736 --> 01:27:57.736
Hi.

1269
01:27:59.113 --> 01:28:00.113
What's goin' on?

1270
01:28:00.865 --> 01:28:01.865
Kal.

1271
01:28:02.742 --> 01:28:03.742
Come 'ere.

1272
01:28:24.889 --> 01:28:27.433
Kal, I... need to tell you something.

1273
01:28:29.352 --> 01:28:33.398
You were with him for over an hour
on the drive here. Couldn't tell him then?


1274
01:28:36.317 --> 01:28:37.568
Can we talk in private?

1275
01:28:37.652 --> 01:28:38.569
No.

1276
01:28:38.653 --> 01:28:41.614
Whatever you need to say,
you can say to all of us.


1277
01:28:41.697 --> 01:28:42.697
Yeah.

1278
01:28:43.616 --> 01:28:46.536
Tell him where you were the other night.
All night long.


1279
01:28:48.663 --> 01:28:50.706
- Kal, please...
- He's not talking to you.


1280
01:28:53.126 --> 01:28:54.460
- Kal.
- What did I say?


1281
01:28:54.544 --> 01:28:57.296
- Let's all just... calm down.
- You, shut up!


1282
01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:59.882
Nobody needs to calm down.
I am mad as hell.


1283
01:29:00.466 --> 01:29:04.220
After all that my son has done for you,
you buy these expensive suits,


1284
01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:07.181
and he has to work overtime
to pay for them. It's insane.


1285
01:29:07.265 --> 01:29:09.892
You don't deserve him.

1286
01:29:11.436 --> 01:29:13.104
You wanna tell me where you were?

1287
01:29:14.939 --> 01:29:15.939
Tell him.

1288
01:29:17.358 --> 01:29:18.358
And be honest.

1289
01:29:19.735 --> 01:29:20.735
Honest?

1290
01:29:23.656 --> 01:29:25.032
Is that what we're doing?

1291
01:29:28.995 --> 01:29:29.995
I lost my job.

1292
01:29:31.122 --> 01:29:32.039
What?

1293
01:29:32.123 --> 01:29:34.125
She's been supporting me the whole time.

1294
01:29:37.712 --> 01:29:39.464
And I'm in rehab.

1295
01:29:41.966 --> 01:29:44.927
- Kal, what are you saying?
- It's all her fault.


1296
01:29:45.011 --> 01:29:48.222
She put too much pressure on you.
She doesn't deserve you.


1297
01:29:48.306 --> 01:29:51.142
I got a call from the court
saying you went to see the judge,


1298
01:29:51.225 --> 01:29:52.268
and you're off the case

1299
01:29:52.351 --> 01:29:55.688
because of an inappropriate relationship
with your client.


1300
01:29:57.148 --> 01:29:58.274
Wanna tell him that?

1301
01:30:00.818 --> 01:30:02.570
What did you mean by that, Mea?

1302
01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.074
Where were you that night?

1303
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:12.538
I spent the night with Zyair.

1304
01:30:18.044 --> 01:30:19.462
Did you fuck him?

1305
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:24.090
Yes.

1306
01:30:24.425 --> 01:30:25.425
I knew it! Oh!

1307
01:30:26.677 --> 01:30:28.930
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1308
01:30:29.722 --> 01:30:31.849
- Fuck, man!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.


1309
01:30:31.933 --> 01:30:33.309
You need to leave!

1310
01:30:33.392 --> 01:30:34.894
- I got you.
- I'm sorry.


1311
01:30:34.977 --> 01:30:36.771
I said, you need to leave!

1312
01:30:38.105 --> 01:30:40.775
Get the fuck outta here,
you fucking bitch! Get out!


1313
01:30:40.858 --> 01:30:42.193
Get outta this house!

1314
01:30:42.735 --> 01:30:44.070
- Get out!
- I got you.


1315
01:30:45.154 --> 01:30:47.073
- I got you.
- We got you, baby.


1316
01:30:47.156 --> 01:30:49.116
I didn't do anything wrong, Mom...

1317
01:31:03.589 --> 01:31:05.091
I'm so sorry.

1318
01:31:05.925 --> 01:31:06.925
I know.

1319
01:31:11.722 --> 01:31:12.722
Charlise.

1320
01:31:15.059 --> 01:31:17.061
Get in here. The kids are crying.

1321
01:31:41.168 --> 01:31:43.004
<i>The forecast for today
is more sun.</i>


1322
01:31:43.087 --> 01:31:45.590
<i>It looks like
it will be a warmer-than-normal week.</i>


1323
01:31:46.173 --> 01:31:48.676
<i>In other news,
Chicago District Attorney Ray Harper</i>


1324
01:31:48.759 --> 01:31:51.220
<i>announced a breakthrough
in the Zyair Malloy case.</i>


1325
01:31:51.721 --> 01:31:53.306
<i>With more analysis on the case,</i>

Judy Walker and Jim Forrester.</i>


1327
01:31:57.143 --> 01:31:58.853
<i>Yes, in a surprising turn,</i>

1328
01:31:58.936 --> 01:32:02.148
<i>Zyair Malloy has agreed to a deal
with the prosecution</i>


1329
01:32:02.231 --> 01:32:05.318
<i>that will give him
the opportunity to be eligible for parole.</i>


1330
01:32:05.401 --> 01:32:08.112
<i>So doesn't this mean
no trial and no answers?</i>


1331
01:32:08.195 --> 01:32:10.364
<i>Usually, when these types
of deals are made,</i>


1332
01:32:10.448 --> 01:32:12.074
<i>the defendant has to confess</i>

1333

<i>and tell where the body is.
Is that a part of this deal?</i>


1334
01:32:15.328 --> 01:32:18.205
<i>No. Surprisingly enough,
DA Harper did not ask for that,</i>


1335
01:32:18.289 --> 01:32:19.289
<i>which is shocking.</i>

1336
01:32:19.332 --> 01:32:21.375
<i>I'm sure we'll be hearing from her family.</i>

1337
01:32:21.459 --> 01:32:23.753
<i>Yes, that is strange.
Thank you very much, Brandon.</i>


1338
01:32:29.884 --> 01:32:32.928
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hey! Hey, I've been trying to call you.


1339
01:32:33.012 --> 01:32:35.556
<i>Yeah, I just got on a plane.</i>

1340
01:32:36.349 --> 01:32:37.933
I needed to clear my head.

1341
01:32:38.017 --> 01:32:40.019
Hey, you talk to Kal?

1342
01:32:41.145 --> 01:32:42.145
No.

1343
01:32:42.772 --> 01:32:44.440
He doesn't wanna talk to me.

1344
01:32:44.523 --> 01:32:45.858
You need to call him, Mea.

1345
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:47.568
<i>Why? What did you do?</i>

1346
01:32:47.652 --> 01:32:49.278
He's been going to counseling.

1347
01:32:50.279 --> 01:32:53.991
Let me give it some time. I just need
a second to sit in all of this.


1348
01:32:54.575 --> 01:32:56.452
All right. I love you, girl.

1349
01:32:56.535 --> 01:32:58.496
Love you, Jimmy. Thanks. Bye.

1350
01:32:58.579 --> 01:32:59.579
<i>Bye.</i>

1351
01:33:49.755 --> 01:33:50.755
'Scuse me.

1352
01:33:51.716 --> 01:33:52.758
Yes, ma'am?

1353
01:33:53.592 --> 01:33:54.635
Hydie.

1354
01:33:55.636 --> 01:33:57.722
- Uh...
- You're Hydie.


1355
01:33:57.805 --> 01:34:00.808
Ah... I'm sorry.
No... No speak English.


1356
01:34:00.891 --> 01:34:03.144
You're alive!

1357
01:34:03.227 --> 01:34:04.729
You're gonna talk to me!

1358
01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:10.317
- Why are you running?
- I am not who you think I am.


1359
01:34:10.401 --> 01:34:13.362
- You're coming to the police with me.
- No. No!


1360
01:34:13.446 --> 01:34:14.446
Shit!

1361
01:34:19.452 --> 01:34:20.911
Oh my God!

1362
01:34:20.995 --> 01:34:23.164
Ah! Shit.

1363
01:34:32.548 --> 01:34:34.668
- It's me. I had to get another phone.
- Are you okay?


1364
01:34:34.717 --> 01:34:38.012
Uh... Is Ray around?
Can you put him on the phone?


1365
01:34:38.095 --> 01:34:40.639
Yeah, but he doesn't wanna speak to you.

1366
01:34:40.723 --> 01:34:42.433
Please put him on the phone.

1367
01:34:48.314 --> 01:34:49.857
- Who is it?
- Mea.


1368
01:34:57.782 --> 01:34:58.782
What do <i>you</i> want?

1369
01:34:58.824 --> 01:35:00.367
Yeah, Zyair is innocent.

1370
01:35:02.453 --> 01:35:03.287
What?

1371
01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:06.040
I just saw
the woman that he supposedly killed.


1372
01:35:06.665 --> 01:35:08.542
What are you talkin' about?

1373
01:35:08.626 --> 01:35:11.587
I saw her. She's working at the resort
that I'm staying at.


1374
01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:14.381
I'm at the police station,
but they aren't much help.


1375
01:35:14.465 --> 01:35:16.300
This sounds ridiculous.

1376
01:35:16.383 --> 01:35:18.302
You have an innocent man in jail.

1377
01:35:18.385 --> 01:35:20.505
I'm supposed to believe you
after what you did to Kal?


1378
01:35:20.554 --> 01:35:21.889
<i>You don't have to believe me.</i>

1379
01:35:21.972 --> 01:35:23.057
Well, tell the police.

1380
01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.142
I'm telling you, they're not much help.

1381
01:35:25.226 --> 01:35:28.729
An investigator I'm working with
is on a plane, and when he lands,


1382
01:35:28.813 --> 01:35:31.565
<i>- I'm gonna have him come and find her.</i>
- Where are you?


1383
01:35:31.649 --> 01:35:34.276
I'm in the DR. 
Santo Domingo.

1384
01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.194
<i>Mea.</i>

1385
01:35:35.277 --> 01:35:36.987
This looks bad.

1386
01:35:37.738 --> 01:35:38.781
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1387
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:41.242
You slept with him.

1388
01:35:41.867 --> 01:35:44.787
<i>You wanna help him, let me get
one of my investigators out there.</i>


1389
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:48.249
- No. She'll be gone by then.
<i>- And what are you gonna do to stop her?</i>


1390
01:35:48.749 --> 01:35:51.377
I'll get one of my guys
on the plane right now. Just...


1391
01:35:52.711 --> 01:35:53.711
come home.

1392
01:35:54.547 --> 01:35:56.549
Okay? Come... come here, to the house.

1393
01:35:56.632 --> 01:35:59.677
<i>Kal's here.
Mea, he's been worried sick without you.</i>


1394
01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.470
- No, Ray, I...
<i>- Come.</i>


1395
01:36:01.554 --> 01:36:04.598
- Your mother doesn't want me there.
<i>- Look, I'll talk to her.</i>


1396
01:36:04.682 --> 01:36:07.434
I need to get off the phone.
Let me get my guy on the plane.


1397
01:36:07.518 --> 01:36:08.644
Just come to the house.

1398
01:36:09.812 --> 01:36:10.812
Okay.

1399
01:36:11.438 --> 01:36:13.566
Goddammit!

1400
01:36:58.235 --> 01:36:59.945
- You.
- Mom.


1401
01:37:01.864 --> 01:37:03.157
Is Kal here?

1402
01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.618
He was in the city earlier,
but he's on his way.


1403
01:37:08.162 --> 01:37:09.788
Did you reach your investigator?

1404
01:37:10.456 --> 01:37:11.665
Landing as we speak.

1405
01:37:14.043 --> 01:37:15.502
Hey, don't worry.

1406
01:37:15.586 --> 01:37:17.004
We'll find her, okay?

1407
01:37:21.425 --> 01:37:22.425
Okay.

1408
01:37:27.473 --> 01:37:29.725
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

1409
01:37:29.808 --> 01:37:31.185
Yeah. Go on.

1410
01:37:33.479 --> 01:37:35.522
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey, did you get my message?


1411
01:37:35.606 --> 01:37:37.566
Yeah, s... so she's alive?

1412
01:37:37.650 --> 01:37:38.734
Yeah.

1413
01:37:38.817 --> 01:37:39.985
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

1414
01:37:40.486 --> 01:37:42.321
At my brother-in-law's house.

1415
01:37:42.404 --> 01:37:43.948
- Is his mother there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>


1416
01:37:44.031 --> 01:37:48.243
Okay, listen. Mea, I know I fucked up
with the whole Kal thing.


1417
01:37:48.327 --> 01:37:52.331
<i>I need you to trust me here, all right?
I want you to check your email.</i>


1418
01:38:00.839 --> 01:38:01.839
You're kidding.

1419
01:38:02.508 --> 01:38:05.344
I know it's illegal,
but I had to make it up to you somehow.


1420
01:38:06.845 --> 01:38:07.845
<i>Okay?</i>

1421
01:38:10.891 --> 01:38:11.891
<i>You hear me?</i>

1422
01:38:12.351 --> 01:38:13.727
- I can't...
<i>- Mea?</i>


1423
01:38:14.687 --> 01:38:15.687
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1424
01:38:18.107 --> 01:38:19.274
Hell... Fuck!

1425
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.275
- Mea?
- Yes?


1426
01:39:01.942 --> 01:39:05.904
Can you help me to the counter? This...
This chemo, it just makes me so sick.


1427
01:39:09.033 --> 01:39:10.033
Oh, I...

1428
01:39:10.993 --> 01:39:13.620
I don't think
your phone is working anymore.


1429
01:39:13.704 --> 01:39:16.915
I'm sorry. It just...
it makes me so weak.

1430
01:39:17.916 --> 01:39:19.460
Thank you, dear.

1431
01:39:28.135 --> 01:39:29.135
Thank you.

1432
01:39:30.054 --> 01:39:31.930
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.


1433
01:39:32.931 --> 01:39:35.100
Here. Made you a drink, Mea.

1434
01:39:38.812 --> 01:39:39.897
- Thank you.
- Yeah.


1435
01:39:43.692 --> 01:39:45.319
Kal should've been here by now.

1436
01:39:45.402 --> 01:39:48.322
Yeah. I'll call him. 
You enjoy your drink.

1437
01:39:48.947 --> 01:39:50.866
You wanna help me get this meal ready?

1438
01:39:52.451 --> 01:39:54.745
- Sure.
- Uh, you can wash those.


1439
01:39:54.828 --> 01:39:57.039
Oh! You won't be needing that.

1440
01:39:58.832 --> 01:40:00.125
I'll cut them.

1441
01:40:04.379 --> 01:40:06.965
- You haven't touched your drink.
- What did your clerk say?


1442
01:40:07.883 --> 01:40:10.052
- Think our investigator found her.
- Okay.


1443
01:40:10.886 --> 01:40:11.720
Great.

1444
01:40:11.804 --> 01:40:13.889
Tomorrow we'll talk to Judge Brodan, and...

1445
01:40:14.389 --> 01:40:17.059
...we'll see about
getting that man out of jail.


1446
01:40:17.142 --> 01:40:19.144
Why can't we just hit the judge tonight?

1447
01:40:19.228 --> 01:40:22.272
No. Come on, Mea. 
This is... family time.

1448
01:40:22.356 --> 01:40:24.274
Yeah, it's family time!

1449
01:40:29.238 --> 01:40:31.406
Ray... read your email.

1450
01:40:34.993 --> 01:40:37.371
Go on. Read it!

1451
01:40:45.337 --> 01:40:47.589
Who got you this? Jimmy? Your PI?

1452
01:40:48.298 --> 01:40:51.677
- You mean, Mom, you don't have cancer?
- No, son.


1453
01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.178
And tell her why.

1454
01:40:56.932 --> 01:40:58.725
We cooked all of this shit up.

1455
01:41:00.394 --> 01:41:02.229
I won sympathy for my votes.

1456
01:41:02.312 --> 01:41:05.107
I just don't know
why it took you so long to figure it out.


1457
01:41:05.190 --> 01:41:06.567
Does Kal know about this?

1458
01:41:07.067 --> 01:41:08.569
It would break his heart.

1459
01:41:09.236 --> 01:41:11.822
- Let's toast to family!
- Mm.


1460
01:41:11.905 --> 01:41:13.240
Here's to Charlise,

1461
01:41:13.323 --> 01:41:16.869
who decided to sleep with
a penniless, desperate artist.


1462
01:41:17.911 --> 01:41:19.538
I am so sorry, son.

1463
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.084
Ray, I...

1464
01:41:24.168 --> 01:41:25.752
Oh, shut the fuck up.

1465
01:41:25.836 --> 01:41:29.673
My boys are so good
to both of you,


1466
01:41:29.756 --> 01:41:32.426
and you two
cheat with the same fucking guy?


1467
01:41:32.509 --> 01:41:33.969
I don't believe this.

1468
01:41:34.052 --> 01:41:35.929
Oh, I begged Kal not to marry you.

1469
01:41:36.555 --> 01:41:39.141
I know that you set Zyair up.

1470
01:41:39.224 --> 01:41:41.852
I think... you should let it go.

1471
01:41:43.187 --> 01:41:46.064
Charlise, get the kids.
Let's get out of here, okay?


1472
01:41:48.901 --> 01:41:49.901
C'mon.

1473
01:41:50.319 --> 01:41:51.320
Stab her.

1474
01:41:52.571 --> 01:41:53.571
Do it.

1475
01:41:54.239 --> 01:41:56.491
- No. I won't. I won't. I wo...
- Charlise...


1476
01:41:57.534 --> 01:41:58.869
- Now.
- Charlise.


1477
01:42:02.289 --> 01:42:03.665
- No.
- C'mon.


1478
01:42:05.459 --> 01:42:06.459
You can do it.

1479
01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:09.170
Char...

1480
01:42:59.429 --> 01:43:01.890
Shit. Charlise! Please!

1481
01:43:02.641 --> 01:43:03.517
Charlise...

1482
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.600
Shit!

1483
01:43:07.187 --> 01:43:08.855
C'mon! C'mon!

1484
01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:14.111
Honey, what are you doin'?

1485
01:43:14.903 --> 01:43:16.947
DA's have incredible security.

1486
01:43:18.615 --> 01:43:20.242
That's bulletproof glass.

1487
01:43:20.993 --> 01:43:22.494
The fucking knife down.

1488
01:43:26.999 --> 01:43:30.043
Get his keys.
Get his keys. Get his keys. Run!


1489
01:43:30.127 --> 01:43:30.961
No!

1490
01:43:37.676 --> 01:43:39.261
Shit!

1491
01:44:06.913 --> 01:44:07.913
Shit.

1492
01:45:05.472 --> 01:45:07.099
Help! Please!

1493
01:45:07.182 --> 01:45:08.809
Stop! Stop!

1494
01:45:08.892 --> 01:45:11.144
Please! Please! Please!

1495
01:45:15.690 --> 01:45:18.318
- Mea! Mea! What are you... What are you...
- Kal!


1496
01:45:18.402 --> 01:45:20.129
- Baby, what you...
- We gotta get outta here.


1497
01:45:20.153 --> 01:45:21.905
Wait. What are you talking about?

1498
01:45:21.988 --> 01:45:23.907
- Ray is in on it!
- Wait, what?!


1499
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:25.659
Charlise was sleeping with him.

1500
01:45:25.742 --> 01:45:26.868
- Baby...
- We have to go.


1501
01:45:26.952 --> 01:45:28.829
- Baby, look. Breathe.
- No.


1502
01:45:28.912 --> 01:45:31.748
- Let's just go! He tried to kill me!
- I need you to calm down.


1503
01:45:31.832 --> 01:45:34.459
Who tried to kill you?
Baby, please talk. C'mon.


1504
01:45:34.543 --> 01:45:36.545
- I need you to breathe.
- Call the police!


1505
01:45:36.628 --> 01:45:38.171
C'mon. Get in the car.

1506
01:45:47.931 --> 01:45:49.307
Yeah, 911?

1507
01:45:49.391 --> 01:45:51.476
Okay, yeah, I have an emergency, please.

1508
01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.896
Yeah, I need the police.
It'll be okay. Yeah, please.


1509
01:46:06.032 --> 01:46:09.661
They're asking me what happened.
What happened, Mea? Mea, what happened?


1510
01:46:09.744 --> 01:46:12.289
I'm asking her questions,
but she's not answering.


1511
01:46:12.372 --> 01:46:15.709
Can you just send somebody
to 345 on Highway 57?


1512
01:46:16.877 --> 01:46:18.545
Yeah. Yeah, send somebody.

1513
01:46:20.088 --> 01:46:23.216
Okay, look, they're on the way.
Okay? It's gonna be all right.


1514
01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:24.676
It's gonna be all right.

1515
01:46:24.759 --> 01:46:27.804
- Why are you going to the house?
- We have to wait for the police.


1516
01:46:27.888 --> 01:46:30.432
- They tried to kill me!
- Mea, come on!


1517
01:46:32.517 --> 01:46:33.894
Uh... Yeah, 911?

1518
01:46:37.314 --> 01:46:38.314
Yeah.

1519
01:46:38.982 --> 01:46:40.066
Mm-hmm.

1520
01:46:41.693 --> 01:46:43.361
Yeah, all right, all right. Yeah.

1521
01:46:46.364 --> 01:46:50.452
<i>She figured it out.
I need you to bring her back here.</i>


1522
01:46:50.535 --> 01:46:51.661
<i>Now.</i>

1523
01:46:51.745 --> 01:46:53.330
<i>Get her back here!</i>

1524
01:47:02.255 --> 01:47:03.673
Don't look at me like that.

1525
01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.220
You know, my mom told me
you would do this.


1526
01:47:10.514 --> 01:47:13.475
I had no idea
you'd fall for him like Charlise did.


1527
01:47:16.019 --> 01:47:17.646
You're both so damn stupid.

1528
01:47:17.729 --> 01:47:20.398
Ray told me
I'll never be good enough for you. Never.


1529
01:47:21.525 --> 01:47:24.945
He told me to beat your ass
to just... to get you in line.


1530
01:47:25.445 --> 01:47:28.114
But I said no.

1531
01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:30.951
I said I wanted to
try it the sweet way.

1532
01:47:33.161 --> 01:47:34.579
But my mom was so right.

1533
01:47:36.122 --> 01:47:37.958
That shit would never work with you.

1534
01:47:39.668 --> 01:47:40.668
Why?

1535
01:47:43.088 --> 01:47:44.297
Because you're weak?

1536
01:47:44.381 --> 01:47:45.924
The fuck did you just say?

1537
01:47:48.718 --> 01:47:50.345
That's why I was with him.

1538
01:47:52.264 --> 01:47:53.264
A man

1539
01:47:54.516 --> 01:47:56.393
with money and success.

1540
01:47:58.562 --> 01:47:59.604
He is nothing.

1541
01:48:02.607 --> 01:48:03.900
If you only knew.

1542
01:48:08.947 --> 01:48:10.657
That's right. You can look at me here.

1543
01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:12.742
See, that was
a decision of mine. See that?


1544
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:26.506
What are you doin'?

1545
01:48:27.465 --> 01:48:28.465
Get off, bitch!

1546
01:48:46.359 --> 01:48:48.653
Oh my Lord, are you okay?

1547
01:48:48.737 --> 01:48:49.946
Ma'am, are you okay?

1548
01:48:56.411 --> 01:49:00.206
Debbie, we are on the scene where we are
told DA Raymond Harper has been arrested


1549
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:03.877
for covering up evidence in a crime
along with a number of other charges.


1550
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.214
We are also being told that this is all
in connection with the Zyair Malloy case.


1551
01:49:08.298 --> 01:49:10.425
The attorney general
has issued a statement


1552
01:49:10.508 --> 01:49:14.137
saying they are investigating this case,
as well as several others.


1553
01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:15.722
And our sources have revealed

1554
01:49:15.805 --> 01:49:19.351
all of the evidence that was presented
to the state's attorney against him,


1555
01:49:19.434 --> 01:49:21.102
apparently in an anonymous email,

1556
01:49:21.186 --> 01:49:24.397
gave several details on the nature
of the crimes that were alleged.


1557
01:49:24.481 --> 01:49:27.442
They are scheduled to hold
a press conference to brief the public,


1558
01:49:27.525 --> 01:49:29.527
and you can believe
Channel 7 will be there.


1559
01:49:30.236 --> 01:49:32.238
How does it feel to be free?

1560
01:49:32.322 --> 01:49:34.282
Are you angry at the prosecution?

1561
01:49:36.993 --> 01:49:38.703
Sir, please look this way!

1562
01:49:40.163 --> 01:49:42.832
Are you...
are you angry at the prosecution?


1563
01:49:45.251 --> 01:49:46.961
How does it feel to be free?

1564
01:49:47.504 --> 01:49:49.923
- Long overdue.
- Are you angry at the prosecution?


1565
01:49:50.006 --> 01:49:52.342
I'm angry at any system
that can allow this to happen.


1566
01:49:52.425 --> 01:49:54.511
Who would you like to
