00:00:19.044 --> 00:00:22.839
<i>So, what you're sayin
is that you're responsible</i>


2
00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.132
for the deaths?

3
00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:27.927
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.597
You killed all those people?

5
00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:32.474
I am responsible
for their deaths.


6
00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:34.142
Why?

7
00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.939
There are two
answers to that question,


8
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:42.151
the one that's true and the
one that you will believe.


9
00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:46.740
I'm only interested
in the truth.


10
00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:50.785
All right.

11
00:00:50.827 --> 00:00:54.415
No human was responsible
for these crimes.


12
00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.087
But, if someone must be
punished, then let it be me.


13
00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:01.171
And that's the truth?

14
00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:03.299
That's the truth.

15
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:05.176
Then why don't you
tell me what I'll believe.


16
00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:58.383
<i>Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.</i>


17
00:02:58.424 --> 00:03:01.594
That is so gorgeous.

18
00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:02.957
You didn't help
him pick this out?


19
00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:04.347
All by himself.

20
00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.449
And you didn't see it coming?

21
00:03:05.473 --> 00:03:06.766
No, totally surprised.

22
00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:07.726
Mmm. That's a keeper.

23
00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:09.229
I know.

24
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.413
All right, ladies, break it up.

25
00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:12.439
- Emily got engaged.
- Oh, yeah?


26
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:13.691
Good for you.

27
00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:16.027
Drug test for the homeless
guy in Exam Room 5.


28
00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.403
You are such a romantic.

29
00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:19.322
That's me, Dr. Love.

30
00:03:20.824 --> 00:03:21.950
Back to reality.
Mmm.


31
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.705
Hello.

32
00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.669
I need to draw some
blood, is that all right?


33
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.337
Bye-bye.

34
00:03:35.673 --> 00:03:38.384
You're not going
"bye-bye" just yet.


35
00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.303
I need to roll up your sleeve.

36
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.682
Bye-bye.

37
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.143
Bye-bye.

38
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.605
Bye-bye.

39
00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.066
What's the hurry?
You just got here.


40
00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:02.119
Okay, you're gonna
feel a little pressure.


41
00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:08.876
Bye-bye, Emily.

42
00:04:10.836 --> 00:04:12.379
Hey, how'd you know my name?

43
00:04:20.931 --> 00:04:23.142
Something's wrong.

44
00:04:26.937 --> 00:04:28.522
Oh, my God.

45
00:04:28.564 --> 00:04:30.733
God's not here, Emily.

46
00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.193
I need to get some help.

47
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.279
Fran!

48
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:35.989
You're hurting me.
Let go.


49
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.074
I haven't even started.

50
00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:39.994
Help! Somebody
help me!


51
00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:41.120
Stop!
Bye-bye.


52
00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:42.830
Stop. Let go of me.

53
00:04:43.705 --> 00:04:45.415
Bye-bye.
Why...


54
00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:10.442
<i>Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.</i>


55
00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:18.243
Oh, my God.
What in the world...


56
00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:24.125
Emily, what happened? Emily?

57
00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:26.460
<i>Emily.</i>

58
00:05:27.503 --> 00:05:28.503
<i>Emily.</i>

59
00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:31.841
Crash cart!

60
00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:39.350
I don't know what happened.

61
00:05:39.392 --> 00:05:40.726
What do you mean?

62
00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:43.187
100-year-old homeless
dude had a heart attack.


63
00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.521
Shocker, alert the media.

64
00:05:44.563 --> 00:05:46.690
Yeah, but,
why don't I remember?


65
00:05:46.732 --> 00:05:49.485
I took his blood
and next thing I know,


66
00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:51.363
Fran's yelling at me
to get the crash cart.


67
00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:54.949
Okay, Em, I know this may come
as a bit of a shock to you,


68
00:05:56.492 --> 00:05:58.662
but you're kind of
a sensitive person.


69
00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:01.165
You stuck a guy with a needle,
he had a heart attack,


70
00:06:01.207 --> 00:06:03.042
you had a momentary freak out.

71
00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:04.419
Yeah, I guess.

72
00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:08.505
People dropping dead
is part of the job.


73
00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:10.842
Don't give it another
thought, just go home.


74
00:06:10.884 --> 00:06:12.552
Have crazy fiance sex with Will.

75
00:07:22.878 --> 00:07:24.297
Emily.

76
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:31.596
Holy...

77
00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:34.808
Hey, hey, hey.

78
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.685
Oh, God.
It's just a dream.


79
00:07:36.726 --> 00:07:38.354
Yeah.

80
00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:39.938
You're safe. Huh.
Yeah.


81
00:07:40.606 --> 00:07:41.858
Yeah, okay.

82
00:07:43.193 --> 00:07:45.736
I won't let anything
bad happen to you.


83
00:07:45.778 --> 00:07:47.071
Yeah?
Yeah.


84
00:07:49.407 --> 00:07:51.326
You're stuck with me forever.

85
00:07:51.368 --> 00:07:52.619
Hello.

86
00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:55.331
Oops.

87
00:07:55.373 --> 00:07:57.542
Is that your mother?

88
00:07:57.583 --> 00:07:58.625
Welcome to the family.

89
00:08:09.304 --> 00:08:10.472
You gave her a key?

90
00:08:10.514 --> 00:08:12.057
She's my mother.

91
00:08:12.098 --> 00:08:13.766
Sorry, I should've told you.

92
00:08:13.808 --> 00:08:15.811
Yeah, you should have.
Mom.


93
00:08:15.853 --> 00:08:17.104
Hi.

94
00:08:18.772 --> 00:08:21.984
There they are,
the happy couple.


95
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.652
Hi.

96
00:08:23.694 --> 00:08:25.530
Oh...
Morning, Linda.


97
00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.741
Oh, no, no, no, you cannot
call me Linda anymore.


98
00:08:27.782 --> 00:08:29.076
Now, it's "Mom."

99
00:08:29.117 --> 00:08:30.578
Morning, Mom.

100
00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:31.888
- Morning, daughter.
- Mom, it's...


101
00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:33.414
It's 7:00 in the morning...

102
00:08:33.455 --> 00:08:36.166
I know, sweetie.
It's good to see you.


103
00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:38.127
We have got a
lot of work to do.

104
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.837
A wedding doesn't
plan itself, you know?


105
00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:44.509
So, firstly, I got all the
new bridal magazines.


106
00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:47.720
Oh, but the first order of business
is we have to choose your colors.


107
00:08:47.762 --> 00:08:49.432
Because we can't even
send invitations out


108
00:08:49.473 --> 00:08:51.353
if we don't know what
colors we're dealing with.


109
00:08:51.392 --> 00:08:53.977
And, oh, the church, of course,
we're gonna do it at St. Mark's.


110
00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:55.729
But we've gotta
call Father Avital


111
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:59.149
and get you two enrolled in the
marriage courses immediately.


112
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.027
- Marriage class?
- Yeah.


113
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:03.696
Oh, my God, I almost
forgot the best thing.


114
00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:06.908
Ta-da!

115
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.286
You bought a wedding dress?
Mom, we have a...


116
00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:12.415
What? No, I mean, this is what
I wore to marry your father.


117
00:09:12.457 --> 00:09:13.749
I just...

118
00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:15.000
I wanted Emily to have it.

119
00:09:15.793 --> 00:09:17.503
Only if you like it.

120
00:09:19.213 --> 00:09:21.674
It's pretty.

121
00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:24.177
Yes, it's gorgeous,
it's beautiful.


122
00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:25.638
I love it.

123
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.807
Gorgeous. Ooh...
It's so exciting.


124
00:09:28.848 --> 00:09:30.684
My daughter-in-law.
I'm sorry.


125
00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:31.893
Holding you too tight.

126
00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:33.353
Yeah, I'm fine.

127
00:09:34.188 --> 00:09:35.815
Come on, baby.

128
00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:39.493
Let's get coffee. Come
on, let's get to work.


129
00:09:40.445 --> 00:09:41.737
Come on, you two.
Okay.


130
00:09:43.406 --> 00:09:45.326
Can you call the lab
about the results on four?


131
00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:47.411
It's been over an hour.

132
00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:50.789
I think I can probably
make that happen for you.


133
00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:52.749
Try and work it into
your schedule, will you?


134
00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:57.880
He's so hot, don't you think?

135
00:09:57.922 --> 00:10:02.385
In like a nerdy doctor,
antisocial kind of way.


136
00:10:05.054 --> 00:10:07.891
Ah... I'm sorry, is my fantasy
office romance boring you?


137
00:10:09.226 --> 00:10:10.353
What?

138
00:10:10.394 --> 00:10:11.437
Are you with me here?

139
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.608
Yeah, yeah, sorry, I'm just...

140
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.277
I'm just so spacey, I just
keep drifting off and...


141
00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:20.447
Oh, my God.

142
00:10:20.489 --> 00:10:21.966
That's why you're getting
married, isn't it?


143
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.783
What?
You're totally knocked up.


144
00:10:24.535 --> 00:10:26.786
No, no, I'm not.

145
00:10:26.828 --> 00:10:28.497
Oh, you denying it proves it.

146
00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:30.875
I know what knocked up
sounds like, and that's it.


147
00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:32.436
Oh, you know what
knocked up sounds like?


148
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.253
Mmm-hmm.
- Emily.


149
00:10:34.295 --> 00:10:36.839
Can you assist him with
the suturing in Exam 1?


150
00:10:36.881 --> 00:10:38.717
Sure thing, Fran.

151
00:10:38.758 --> 00:10:41.093
Preggers. You heard
it here first.


152
00:10:41.135 --> 00:10:42.471
Whatever.

153
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.022
And we're done.

154
00:10:54.275 --> 00:10:56.319
There you go.

155
00:10:56.361 --> 00:10:58.739
Emily here is going to
bandage you up, all right?


156
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.281
Well done, Sporto.

157
00:11:03.034 --> 00:11:04.034
Okay.

158
00:11:04.746 --> 00:11:05.747
How we doing?

159
00:11:05.788 --> 00:11:07.331
Okay, I guess.

160
00:11:07.373 --> 00:11:09.041
You did great.

161
00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:11.502
You're, like, one of the bravest
patients we've ever had.


162
00:11:11.544 --> 00:11:13.295
Really?
Absolutely.


163
00:11:14.922 --> 00:11:17.092
So, you play baseball?
Yeah.


164
00:11:17.133 --> 00:11:18.761
What position?

165
00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:20.303
Second base.

166
00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:21.930
Well, I love baseball.

167
00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:27.604
So, what's your favorite team?

168
00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:28.854
Dodgers.

169
00:12:07.563 --> 00:12:09.315
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Bobby!


170
00:12:10.817 --> 00:12:12.210
Oh, my God! It's okay.
It's all right.


171
00:12:12.234 --> 00:12:13.445
What did you do?
My finger!


172
00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:15.947
My finger!
What did you do?


173
00:12:15.989 --> 00:12:17.907
All right.
Mom!


174
00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:27.794
Honey, it's okay.

175
00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:30.463
No, it's not okay.

176
00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:32.548
Em, it was an accident, okay?

177
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.030
You've got to pull
yourself together.


178
00:12:36.094 --> 00:12:37.638
Give us a minute?

179
00:12:38.597 --> 00:12:40.265
I'll be outside.
Yeah.


180
00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:46.939
I think we saved the finger.

181
00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:48.608
Oh, God.

182
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.819
And what the hell happened?

183
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:52.445
I don't remember.

184
00:12:54.364 --> 00:12:57.575
I was talking to him and
he was smiling and then


185
00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:00.746
next thing I know,

186
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.333
he's screaming.

187
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:07.127
Oh,
my God, what did I do?


188
00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:08.546
Emily, listen.

189
00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:14.093
The kid moved, okay?

190
00:13:14.135 --> 00:13:15.554
You told him not to but he did,

191
00:13:15.595 --> 00:13:16.698
he moved right
when you were cutting.


192
00:13:16.722 --> 00:13:18.264
It was an accident.

193
00:13:18.306 --> 00:13:21.519
An accident caused by a
squirming child, that's all.


194
00:13:21.561 --> 00:13:23.229
But he didn't.

195
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.231
He did,

196
00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:27.942
if you want to continue
working here as a nurse.


197
00:13:27.983 --> 00:13:29.193
And we need you here, Emily.

198
00:13:29.235 --> 00:13:31.070
I need you here.
You understand me?


199
00:13:33.031 --> 00:13:35.450
Thank you, Dr. BOGAN.

200
00:13:35.492 --> 00:13:39.830
Emily, come on, you're a good
nurse and a good person.


201
00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:43.710
This was just a freak accident that
will never, ever happen again, right?


202
00:13:43.752 --> 00:13:46.087
No. No, it won't.

203
00:13:46.128 --> 00:13:47.255
Good.

204
00:13:47.296 --> 00:13:49.424
Now, you need anything, anytime,

205
00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:51.509
you can always
call me. All right?


206
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:53.010
Yeah.
Good.


207
00:14:10.196 --> 00:14:12.198
I'm developing carpal tunnel.

208
00:14:14.743 --> 00:14:16.494
Girl, come on.

209
00:14:16.536 --> 00:14:19.999
Okay, I'm coming out.
Just don't laugh.


210
00:14:25.755 --> 00:14:28.507
It's gorgeous. Really, Em.

211
00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:29.843
I like it, too.

212
00:14:30.844 --> 00:14:32.220
This is without alterations?

213
00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:34.890
This is right out of the box.

214
00:14:34.932 --> 00:14:36.642
I didn't expect it
to be this awesome.


215
00:14:36.683 --> 00:14:39.185
Honestly, me neither.

216
00:14:39.227 --> 00:14:40.414
You sure you should be
wearing white, though?


217
00:14:40.438 --> 00:14:41.564
Shut it.

218
00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:43.149
I'm just saying.

219
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.484
You better watch it,

220
00:14:44.525 --> 00:14:46.128
'cause I haven't picked out
the bridesmaid dresses yet.


221
00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:48.195
Okay, I take it back.
I take it all back.


222
00:14:48.237 --> 00:14:49.799
The last thing I need
is to have to pick out


223
00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:51.617
a peach-colored
potato sack.


224
00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:52.743
With matching shoes.

225
00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:54.578
Lest we forget the shoes.

226
00:15:01.126 --> 00:15:03.087
Don't say that.
Stop.


227
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.507
What?
What?


228
00:15:06.549 --> 00:15:08.010
No, you, "What?"

229
00:15:08.051 --> 00:15:10.261
Huh? What did you
just say, weirdo?


230
00:15:10.303 --> 00:15:12.180
I didn't say anything.

231
00:15:12.221 --> 00:15:15.059
You totally just
whispered something.


232
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.770
Oh. I guess I was
talking to myself.


233
00:15:17.812 --> 00:15:19.229
Sorry, I'm changing out of this.

234
00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:20.791
It's too weird walking
around in this thing.


235
00:15:20.815 --> 00:15:23.215
I think you should rock that
dress and we should hit the bar.


236
00:15:23.985 --> 00:15:25.319
Okay, well, do what you want.

237
00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:26.780
Right.

238
00:15:34.287 --> 00:15:36.581
She's my friend.
What are you saying?


239
00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:39.752
Okay, just stop.

240
00:15:41.713 --> 00:15:43.422
No, she's my friend.

241
00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:45.174
Em?

242
00:15:45.216 --> 00:15:47.802
What are you even saying?
Just stop it.


243
00:15:49.763 --> 00:15:51.348
No, you're a liar.

244
00:15:52.892 --> 00:15:54.768
She loves me.
Just stop.


245
00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:56.562
Stop.

246
00:15:58.522 --> 00:15:59.607
No.

247
00:16:00.274 --> 00:16:01.274
No.

248
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:04.445
No, just stop it.
She's my friend.


249
00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:06.364
Em.

250
00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.366
I'm changing.

251
00:16:08.408 --> 00:16:10.159
Jesus, I'm sorry.
I just heard you talking.


252
00:16:10.201 --> 00:16:11.328
Get the fuck out!

253
00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:16.709
Damn.

254
00:16:24.134 --> 00:16:25.176
What?

255
00:16:28.346 --> 00:16:29.741
I still think
I was overdressed.


256
00:16:29.765 --> 00:16:30.974
No, no, no.

257
00:16:31.016 --> 00:16:33.268
Sweetie, you were perfect.

258
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:36.188
Surprise!

259
00:16:39.316 --> 00:16:41.318
Congratulations!
Happy engagement!


260
00:16:43.947 --> 00:16:46.283
Yay! Happy...

261
00:16:46.324 --> 00:16:49.078
This is incredible, thank you.

262
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.538
- Get some champagne going.
- Hey, congratulations.


263
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.999
Please, just listen, I
just want to say something.


264
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:56.085
I really hope you two are
gonna start a family soon.


265
00:16:56.128 --> 00:16:57.837
Linda, don't pressure the kids.

266
00:16:57.879 --> 00:16:59.464
Here we go.

267
00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:01.400
Of course, if you guys are
thinking about having a family,


268
00:17:01.424 --> 00:17:03.509
I'm sure your mother
has a lot of good advice.


269
00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:05.446
A lot of advice. Starting right now.
I'm sure she does.


270
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.599
The clock is ticking, right
now, it's gotta be happening.


271
00:17:08.641 --> 00:17:11.894
Uh... Linda. The clock is
always ticking with Linda.


272
00:17:11.936 --> 00:17:13.562
Father Avital.
Linda.


273
00:17:13.604 --> 00:17:15.731
Oh. So nice
of you to come.


274
00:17:15.773 --> 00:17:17.483
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

275
00:17:17.524 --> 00:17:19.778
William, great to see you.
It's been too long.


276
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.446
Yes, it has.

277
00:17:21.488 --> 00:17:25.492
Father, this is Emily,
my fiancee.


278
00:17:25.533 --> 00:17:30.038
Father Avital has been my priest
since, well, since I was born.


279
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.373
That makes me feel old.

280
00:17:31.415 --> 00:17:33.250
Oh, please,
you don't look a day older


281
00:17:33.292 --> 00:17:34.603
than the first day you
arrived at St. Mark's.


282
00:17:34.627 --> 00:17:36.545
I wish.

283
00:17:36.587 --> 00:17:38.255
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Emily.


284
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.303
William's mom and dad
speak very highly of you.


285
00:17:44.346 --> 00:17:46.015
Oh, yeah.

286
00:17:49.476 --> 00:17:51.228
They tell me you're in medicine.

287
00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:56.193
She's a nurse at County.
Ah!


288
00:17:56.234 --> 00:17:58.528
What an honorable profession.

289
00:18:00.071 --> 00:18:01.322
Do you like it?

290
00:18:02.532 --> 00:18:03.532
Em?

291
00:18:05.661 --> 00:18:07.163
Um...

292
00:18:07.205 --> 00:18:10.875
Father, I am sorry. She's
not been feeling very well.


293
00:18:10.916 --> 00:18:14.212
In certain cases, it's the exact
thing that needs to be done.


294
00:18:15.254 --> 00:18:16.965
Mmm. You could
be right.


295
00:18:17.007 --> 00:18:18.175
Hey.

296
00:18:18.217 --> 00:18:20.343
Can I talk to you for a second?

297
00:18:20.385 --> 00:18:21.636
Yeah, sure.

298
00:18:26.976 --> 00:18:29.311
Emily, what's going on?

299
00:18:33.399 --> 00:18:34.399
Mmm.

300
00:18:34.901 --> 00:18:36.777
What the hell?

301
00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:38.530
I've seen you looking at me.

302
00:18:38.572 --> 00:18:41.324
Emily, Jesus, this is
your engagement party.


303
00:18:41.366 --> 00:18:42.409
What are you thinking?

304
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.786
If you don't want me,

305
00:18:44.828 --> 00:18:47.330
then just tell 'me to stop.

306
00:18:58.843 --> 00:18:59.844
Well, excuse me.

307
00:19:00.303 --> 00:19:01.346
Oh, Jesus.

308
00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:10.355
Emily, what are you doing?

309
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.484
All right, everyone, it's time
for the maid of honor to talk.


310
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.379
And get comfy,

311
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:35.968
'cause I tend to get a little
chatty after champagne.


312
00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:40.764
Okay, so, I've known Emily since
freshman year of college.


313
00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:42.975
That's when she was going
through what I like to call


314
00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.726
her "mom jeans" phase.

315
00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:49.398
But with my guidance she
rebounded from fashion disaster.


316
00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:54.946
Sweetie, dial it back.

317
00:19:54.988 --> 00:19:57.616
When she met Will,
I knew it was special.


318
00:19:57.658 --> 00:20:00.286
She never talked about boys,
so when she brought him up,


319
00:20:00.328 --> 00:20:02.037
I just knew that...

320
00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:08.043
Okay, Em, kind of
doing something up here.


321
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.146
Emily.
Oh, my God.


322
00:20:25.188 --> 00:20:27.690
- Are you cut?
- Are you okay?


323
00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:29.317
It's bleeding.
You're okay.


324
00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:30.526
Oh, my God.

325
00:20:32.321 --> 00:20:34.081
- Let's get you some water.
- Okay.


326
00:20:36.074 --> 00:20:37.993
You're lucky
you didn't cut yourself.


327
00:20:39.744 --> 00:20:40.871
Are you on something?

328
00:20:40.912 --> 00:20:42.747
No! Of course not.
I just...


329
00:20:45.335 --> 00:20:48.838
I don't know. I guess I just
had too much champagne.


330
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.150
No, I've seen you drunk. I've
never seen you act like that.


331
00:20:51.174 --> 00:20:52.342
That was just plain rude.

332
00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:53.467
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:53.509 --> 00:20:54.911
You were acting
like a crazy person.


334
00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:58.598
Do you want me to call
the whole thing off?


335
00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.975
Hmm?

336
00:21:00.017 --> 00:21:01.977
Do you want out?
No.


337
00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:04.539
Well, you don't have to put on a
show, you just have to tell me.


338
00:21:07.442 --> 00:21:09.152
You are my person.

339
00:21:14.408 --> 00:21:17.536
I know I can act
crazy sometimes.


340
00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:20.581
This isn't the norm
Em crazy, this is...


341
00:21:20.622 --> 00:21:22.333
A little elevated?

342
00:21:22.375 --> 00:21:23.751
Yeah, a little.

343
00:22:02.334 --> 00:22:04.879
Hey, I'm not supposed to be there
for 20 more minutes, right?


344
00:22:04.921 --> 00:22:06.465
I know.

345
00:22:06.506 --> 00:22:08.300
Consider this
your reminder call.


346
00:22:08.341 --> 00:22:12.471
I'm sorry, honey, I'm just not thrilled
about Catholic marriage class.


347
00:22:12.512 --> 00:22:14.681
<i>I know, but
it's important to my folks.</i>


348
00:22:14.723 --> 00:22:16.350
Father Avital means a lot to us

349
00:22:16.392 --> 00:22:19.520
and if we want him to do the
wedding, we gotta do the classes.


350
00:22:19.561 --> 00:22:22.273
Okay, I'm walking
out the door right now.


351
00:22:22.315 --> 00:22:23.690
Attagirl.
<i>Love you.</i>


352
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:34.035
Shit.

353
00:22:34.828 --> 00:22:35.828
Come on.

354
00:22:42.504 --> 00:22:44.672
William.
Father.


355
00:22:44.713 --> 00:22:46.715
Emily, it's nice
to see you again.


356
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.594
Uh... Again?

357
00:22:49.636 --> 00:22:54.183
Uh. Father Avital was at our engagement
party, sweetie. I introduced you.


358
00:22:54.224 --> 00:22:57.727
Oh, right, of course. I'm sorry, Father.
It's good to see you again.


359
00:22:57.769 --> 00:23:00.690
You don't remember us meeting?

360
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:03.901
I'm afraid I celebrated a
little too much that night.


361
00:23:03.943 --> 00:23:06.363
Yes.

362
00:23:06.404 --> 00:23:08.490
And our talk in the back hallway?

363
00:23:08.532 --> 00:23:10.659
Excuse me.
Oh.


364
00:23:10.701 --> 00:23:14.163
No. Did we have
a full-on conversation?


365
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:19.168
I'm sorry, I'm so embarrassed.

366
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.419
What you must think of me.

367
00:23:21.253 --> 00:23:22.589
What did we talk about?

368
00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:27.427
Never mind, never mind.

369
00:23:27.469 --> 00:23:28.678
Let's get started, shall we?

370
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.180
Come on.
Okay.


371
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:01.023
I guess, we haven't
really talked about it.


372
00:24:01.047 --> 00:24:03.258
But I've always
wanted kids, I mean...


373
00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:05.134
I guess we both have.

374
00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:06.344
Right, sweetie?

375
00:24:06.386 --> 00:24:07.971
Yes.

376
00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:10.766
"Fill the earth
and subdue it."


377
00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:14.270
Genesis 1:28.

378
00:24:22.153 --> 00:24:23.153
Do you like it?

379
00:24:25.365 --> 00:24:26.699
No.

380
00:24:26.741 --> 00:24:28.577
Em. FATHER AVITAL:
That's quite all right.


381
00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:30.704
It is a little intense, I admit.

382
00:24:31.664 --> 00:24:33.832
But, you see,

383
00:24:33.874 --> 00:24:38.421
the Crucifixion is a
violent and gory reminder


384
00:24:38.463 --> 00:24:40.756
of the ultimate sacrifice.

385
00:24:40.798 --> 00:24:44.094
But it is also the
ultimate sign of faith.


386
00:24:46.388 --> 00:24:47.847
What the fuck
are you looking at?


387
00:24:47.889 --> 00:24:49.015
Emily!

388
00:24:49.057 --> 00:24:50.100
I'm sorry?

389
00:24:50.142 --> 00:24:51.602
Oh, you should be.

390
00:24:51.644 --> 00:24:52.812
Em.

391
00:24:52.853 --> 00:24:55.523
He's leering at me.

392
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.861
I am looking at you, Emily.

393
00:25:00.903 --> 00:25:03.531
Tell him to stop
raping me with his eyes!


394
00:25:03.573 --> 00:25:04.575
Emily!

395
00:25:21.426 --> 00:25:23.345
I don't know what to say.

396
00:25:23.386 --> 00:25:25.013
You don't have to say anything.

397
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:29.602
It's probably the flu.

398
00:25:29.644 --> 00:25:34.273
Yes, sometimes a fever can
bring on strange behavior.


399
00:25:35.065 --> 00:25:36.065
Yeah.

400
00:25:40.155 --> 00:25:42.032
William,

401
00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:44.826
I want to ask you
a delicate question.


402
00:25:44.868 --> 00:25:46.036
I don't want to upset you.

403
00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.077
Okay.

404
00:25:49.247 --> 00:25:52.460
Is there a history of mental
illness in Emily's family?


405
00:25:52.502 --> 00:25:53.961
What?

406
00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:56.047
Well, you know,

407
00:25:56.088 --> 00:25:58.591
bipolar disorder,
manic depression,


408
00:25:58.633 --> 00:25:59.860
schizophrenia,
that sort of thing.


409
00:25:59.884 --> 00:26:01.928
She's adopted. Um...

410
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.097
I don't know her family history.

411
00:26:08.644 --> 00:26:10.270
How are you feeling?

412
00:26:10.312 --> 00:26:12.399
I'm mortified.

413
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.360
I'm so sorry, Father.

414
00:26:15.402 --> 00:26:18.238
Oh. Don't be silly.

415
00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:20.823
You're not responsible
for getting ill.


416
00:26:21.408 --> 00:26:22.701
Thanks.

417
00:26:23.452 --> 00:26:25.079
Thank you, Father.

418
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.873
William, why don't you go bring the
car around? I'll walk Emily out.


419
00:26:27.915 --> 00:26:29.417
No, I don't mind.

420
00:26:29.458 --> 00:26:30.793
Go ahead, William.

421
00:26:30.834 --> 00:26:33.087
I think that's
a good idea, yeah.


422
00:26:33.504 --> 00:26:35.340
Okay.

423
00:26:35.382 --> 00:26:36.902
I'll see you in a few minutes.
Mmm-hmm.


424
00:26:45.475 --> 00:26:48.896
Emily, what happened
between you and Dr. BOGAN


425
00:26:48.938 --> 00:26:50.981
the other night at
your engagement party?


426
00:26:51.899 --> 00:26:53.276
What do you mean?

427
00:26:53.317 --> 00:26:54.860
In the hallway.

428
00:26:57.154 --> 00:27:00.367
Did I not introduce you two?

429
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:03.662
I'm sorry, I'm horrible
at the whole hostess thing.


430
00:27:03.704 --> 00:27:05.289
Emily, I saw you.

431
00:27:06.206 --> 00:27:07.874
You know I saw you.

432
00:27:08.876 --> 00:27:10.837
You saw me what, Father?

433
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:16.968
I don't... I don't know
what you're saying.


434
00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:21.348
Well, never mind.

435
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.558
Yeah.

436
00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:25.352
Never mind.

437
00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:32.944
I don't know, maybe
she does have a fever.


438
00:27:33.487 --> 00:27:35.155
Yeah.

439
00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:36.824
She's in the shower now.

440
00:27:38.116 --> 00:27:40.869
Okay, I'll check
when she's out, but...


441
00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:46.917
Mom, I gotta go.

442
00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:51.840
I want you.

443
00:27:53.007 --> 00:27:54.926
I thought you weren't
feeling very well.


444
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.681
No, I feel amazing.

445
00:28:00.516 --> 00:28:02.434
Don't I look amazing?

446
00:28:04.728 --> 00:28:07.357
What is going on with you?

447
00:28:07.398 --> 00:28:10.276
You just yacked your guts
out all over a priest.


448
00:28:10.318 --> 00:28:13.571
Right after you accused him
of raping you with his eyes.


449
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.948
He was leering at me.

450
00:28:17.284 --> 00:28:18.828
He likes my body.

451
00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:21.580
You don't?

452
00:28:22.874 --> 00:28:25.083
Emily, he thinks you're insane.

453
00:28:25.125 --> 00:28:26.960
Fuck him.
"Fuck him"?


454
00:28:27.336 --> 00:28:29.631
Oh, my...

455
00:28:29.673 --> 00:28:32.967
What is wrong with you?
Please, please, tell me.


456
00:28:38.765 --> 00:28:41.268
Everything is right.

457
00:28:48.651 --> 00:28:50.277
Hey, hey, I'm serious.

458
00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:53.323
What if this is some kind
of bipolar thing? Huh?


459
00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:55.868
Listen, we should talk about it.

460
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.452
No more talking.

461
00:29:13.763 --> 00:29:14.805
What the...

462
00:29:23.814 --> 00:29:24.900
Ow! Damn it.

463
00:29:26.902 --> 00:29:28.069
More sins.
Oh, my God.


464
00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:30.906
Hey.

465
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:34.785
Willy, Willy, Willy.

466
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.985
Enough. Enough.

467
00:30:06.444 --> 00:30:07.570
Jeez.

468
00:30:21.084 --> 00:30:24.006
Look at this.
You shredded my back.


469
00:30:24.047 --> 00:30:26.215
I might actually need stitches.

470
00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:27.257
Hey.

471
00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.636
Hey, Em.

472
00:30:29.678 --> 00:30:31.179
Where are you going?

473
00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:32.204
Jesus, Emily.
What are you doing?


474
00:31:32.246 --> 00:31:34.749
Can I sleep with you tonight?

475
00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.167
Wait. How did
you get in here?


476
00:31:38.127 --> 00:31:39.420
The door was unlocked.

477
00:31:40.671 --> 00:31:43.092
No. I locked it.

478
00:31:44.426 --> 00:31:45.677
Oh.

479
00:31:45.719 --> 00:31:48.055
I guess you didn't.

480
00:31:48.097 --> 00:31:52.059
Okay, Emily, I love you, but
you're scaring the shit out of me.


481
00:31:54.854 --> 00:31:56.856
You shouldn't be scared.

482
00:31:56.898 --> 00:31:58.691
You should be horrified.

483
00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:03.237
Why? What do you mean?

484
00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:07.618
You should be horrified because you
know I'm here to hurt you, Tara.


485
00:32:09.411 --> 00:32:11.872
Get out. Emily,
get out of my house.


486
00:32:11.914 --> 00:32:16.210
You should be horrified because you
know that when you look at me,


487
00:32:17.336 --> 00:32:18.755
I'm not Emily.

488
00:32:19.965 --> 00:32:21.007
No.

489
00:32:27.848 --> 00:32:28.848
Hmm.

490
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:33.562
Hmm.

491
00:32:38.485 --> 00:32:41.446
You're so, so pretty.

492
00:32:52.875 --> 00:32:54.627
Okay. Emily.

493
00:32:56.212 --> 00:32:57.254
Please.

494
00:33:00.383 --> 00:33:02.594
It's me.

495
00:33:02.636 --> 00:33:04.956
Emily's not
here to protect you anymore.


496
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:13.272
Hey, Tara.
What's going on?


497
00:33:13.314 --> 00:33:14.541
I need you to get
over here right now.


498
00:33:14.565 --> 00:33:16.151
Tara?

499
00:33:16.193 --> 00:33:17.610
She's gone crazy.

500
00:33:17.652 --> 00:33:19.588
Whoa. Slow down. What do you mean?
What's going on?


501
00:33:19.612 --> 00:33:22.448
She's here. She's trying
to break down my door.


502
00:33:23.325 --> 00:33:24.326
I'm calling the cops.

503
00:33:24.368 --> 00:33:26.245
No, don't. Don't.
Don't. Tara, please.


504
00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:27.705
I'm coming over right now.

505
00:33:27.746 --> 00:33:29.307
She wants to hurt me.
<i>Ten minutes, Tara.</i>


506
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:30.708
I'm walking out right now.

507
00:33:30.749 --> 00:33:34.420
Please do not call the cops.
Let me handle this.


508
00:33:34.462 --> 00:33:36.048
If you're not
here in 10 minutes...


509
00:33:36.089 --> 00:33:37.298
I will be.

510
00:33:41.553 --> 00:33:42.713
Tara.

511
00:33:43.847 --> 00:33:45.140
Let me in, Tara.

512
00:33:45.182 --> 00:33:47.143
Leave me alone!

513
00:33:47.185 --> 00:33:49.187
Why are you doing this?

514
00:33:49.229 --> 00:33:50.897
Tara.

515
00:33:51.772 --> 00:33:53.524
Take my hand, Tara.

516
00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:56.318
Tara.

517
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.363
I'm calling the cops, Emily!

518
00:34:00.365 --> 00:34:02.826
Take my hand, Tara.
Oh, God.


519
00:34:04.078 --> 00:34:05.412
Take my hand!

520
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:09.084
Tara.

521
00:34:14.422 --> 00:34:16.799
Tara, I'm not going to kill you.

522
00:34:16.841 --> 00:34:18.260
I'm not going to kill you!

523
00:34:18.301 --> 00:34:19.761
I'm not going to kill you!

524
00:34:19.803 --> 00:34:21.889
Kill you! Kill you!
Kill you!


525
00:34:21.931 --> 00:34:25.392
I'm not going to kill you! Kill you!
Kill you! Kill you! Kill you!


526
00:34:25.434 --> 00:34:27.644
Kill you! Kill you!
Kill you! Kill you!


527
00:34:27.686 --> 00:34:29.688
Kill you! Kill you!
Kill you! Kill you!


528
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:47.833
Em.

529
00:34:49.335 --> 00:34:50.795
Tara.

530
00:34:50.836 --> 00:34:52.297
Open the door.

531
00:35:08.648 --> 00:35:09.690
Em?

532
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.403
Tara?

533
00:37:05.983 --> 00:37:07.777
I know this is difficult,

534
00:37:07.818 --> 00:37:10.572
but I'm gonna need to
ask you a few questions.


535
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:13.700
Yes, of course.

536
00:37:13.742 --> 00:37:15.327
Sure.

537
00:37:15.369 --> 00:37:18.372
Can you walk us through the
events of the evening?


538
00:37:20.332 --> 00:37:23.544
We went to Father Avital's
office, and then...


539
00:37:25.797 --> 00:37:27.673
And then, I'm not so sure.

540
00:37:28.716 --> 00:37:30.051
We were at home,

541
00:37:30.093 --> 00:37:33.013
and Emily decided to come
over to Tara's for the night.


542
00:37:33.055 --> 00:37:34.390
Um...

543
00:37:34.432 --> 00:37:36.683
She came here
and then went to bed.


544
00:37:37.893 --> 00:37:40.396
Right, sweetie?
Yeah.


545
00:37:40.438 --> 00:37:41.718
Why did you
spend the night here?


546
00:37:42.523 --> 00:37:43.690
We had a fight.

547
00:37:43.732 --> 00:37:45.568
Would you let her answer?

548
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.364
We did.
We had a fight and...


549
00:37:50.532 --> 00:37:52.826
And I was upset.

550
00:37:52.867 --> 00:37:58.082
So I came over here
and next thing I know,


551
00:37:59.334 --> 00:38:00.876
Will's shaking me awake.

552
00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:04.630
And Tara...

553
00:38:06.215 --> 00:38:08.927
And then Tara just...

554
00:38:08.969 --> 00:38:10.179
Hey.
She just...


555
00:38:11.805 --> 00:38:13.182
Oh, my God.

556
00:38:13.223 --> 00:38:15.184
Why did you come
over here so late?


557
00:38:15.225 --> 00:38:17.894
Like I said,
we'd had a fight.


558
00:38:17.936 --> 00:38:21.191
And I wanted to make up,
so I came over.


559
00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:23.609
I walked in here

560
00:38:25.153 --> 00:38:26.363
and I found her.

561
00:38:27.697 --> 00:38:28.739
What was the fight about?

562
00:38:28.781 --> 00:38:31.702
That's personal.

563
00:38:31.743 --> 00:38:34.288
Look, I think that's enough
questions here, Detective.


564
00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.290
Um. We've had
a rough night.


565
00:38:36.332 --> 00:38:38.501
I'd like to take my fiancee home

566
00:38:38.543 --> 00:38:40.627
so that we can cope
with this tragedy.


567
00:38:40.669 --> 00:38:41.670
Sure.

568
00:38:51.557 --> 00:38:52.641
Hey.

569
00:38:56.354 --> 00:38:58.606
You're burning up.

570
00:38:58.647 --> 00:39:00.649
I'll get you an aspirin.
Okay.


571
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.620
Why would she do that, Will?

572
00:39:11.661 --> 00:39:13.663
Why?
I don't know, honey.


573
00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:17.293
She killed herself.

574
00:39:19.003 --> 00:39:20.004
Yeah, I know.

575
00:39:22.048 --> 00:39:23.674
She's going to burn in hell.

576
00:39:29.223 --> 00:39:30.849
You don't believe that.

577
00:39:31.934 --> 00:39:33.102
I know it.

578
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.397
She'll burn and rot.

579
00:39:37.482 --> 00:39:39.692
And there will be no reprieve.

580
00:39:40.402 --> 00:39:41.819
Emily?

581
00:39:43.572 --> 00:39:44.948
Hey, hey.

582
00:39:44.989 --> 00:39:46.241
What's happening to me?

583
00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:47.700
I have no idea.

584
00:39:49.078 --> 00:39:51.623
I really don't know, sweetie.

585
00:39:51.664 --> 00:39:53.874
Just... Can you
just hold me?


586
00:39:53.916 --> 00:39:55.126
Yeah. Okay.

587
00:39:57.587 --> 00:39:59.380
Hey.

588
00:39:59.422 --> 00:40:01.675
Tell me...
Just tell me...


589
00:40:05.762 --> 00:40:08.723
I love how you're always
cold, even in the summer.


590
00:40:10.267 --> 00:40:13.062
I love how you say you
like horror movies,


591
00:40:13.104 --> 00:40:14.730
but cover your
eyes the whole time.


592
00:40:16.524 --> 00:40:22.238
I love how you laugh
with your whole body.


593
00:40:26.743 --> 00:40:28.370
And I love that you
like me to tell you


594
00:40:28.412 --> 00:40:30.122
all the things
that I love about you.


595
00:42:01.638 --> 00:42:02.723
Help!

596
00:42:05.017 --> 00:42:06.060
William!

597
00:42:07.144 --> 00:42:08.396
William!

598
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.315
William!

599
00:42:11.357 --> 00:42:12.442
Emily!

600
00:42:14.652 --> 00:42:16.947
Oh, my God.
Help me, William. Help!


601
00:42:16.988 --> 00:42:18.865
Help me, William.
Help me.


602
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.202
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


603
00:42:22.244 --> 00:42:23.662
Oh, my God.

604
00:42:23.704 --> 00:42:25.289
What's happening?

605
00:42:33.339 --> 00:42:34.966
That should hold.

606
00:42:35.007 --> 00:42:37.803
But we're gonna have
to call an ambulance.


607
00:42:44.017 --> 00:42:45.728
Why did you do this?

608
00:42:47.938 --> 00:42:50.274
I was going to hurt you.

609
00:42:50.818 --> 00:42:51.985
What?

610
00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:56.906
I was going to stab
you while you slept.


611
00:42:57.783 --> 00:42:59.909
I went to get the knife and

612
00:43:01.244 --> 00:43:02.789
I stood over you.

613
00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:07.918
I was going to cut you.

614
00:43:11.506 --> 00:43:13.133
I wanted to do it.

615
00:43:14.677 --> 00:43:15.927
He told me

616
00:43:17.304 --> 00:43:18.681
how good it would feel.

617
00:43:19.264 --> 00:43:20.557
Who did?

618
00:43:23.143 --> 00:43:25.355
The demon inside of me.

619
00:43:28.358 --> 00:43:29.901
At first, he just

620
00:43:30.902 --> 00:43:32.069
whispered.

621
00:43:33.697 --> 00:43:35.490
I could hear him,

622
00:43:36.992 --> 00:43:39.370
but I couldn't make out
what he was saying.


623
00:43:41.455 --> 00:43:44.958
But then...
Then he got louder.


624
00:43:47.212 --> 00:43:48.380
And now...

625
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.592
And now he's overpowering me.

626
00:43:53.927 --> 00:43:57.013
And I can't fight him.

627
00:43:59.308 --> 00:44:00.727
He killed Tara.

628
00:44:03.688 --> 00:44:05.940
And he tried to kill you.

629
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.071
And the only way
I could stop him was


630
00:44:12.072 --> 00:44:13.490
to cut myself.

631
00:44:14.408 --> 00:44:16.368
You're just sick.

632
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.662
Sweetie, you're just sick.

633
00:44:20.372 --> 00:44:21.999
We're gonna fix this.

634
00:44:23.251 --> 00:44:24.460
You and me.

635
00:44:25.628 --> 00:44:27.171
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

636
00:44:27.213 --> 00:44:28.715
We're gonna get
you the best help


637
00:44:28.757 --> 00:44:29.797
that you can possibly get.

638
00:44:30.884 --> 00:44:33.512
I'm gonna go get my phone.

639
00:44:33.554 --> 00:44:34.847
Okay?
Don't. Stay.


640
00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:37.015
I'm just gonna get my phone

641
00:44:38.016 --> 00:44:39.476
and call an ambulance.

642
00:44:39.518 --> 00:44:42.229
Don't. Don't leave me.
Please don't go.


643
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:44.023
God, Will, don't.

644
00:44:44.065 --> 00:44:46.317
Will, don't go!
Will, don't go!


645
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.448
Emily?

646
00:44:54.325 --> 00:44:55.661
<i>Emily.</i>

647
00:44:55.703 --> 00:44:57.455
<i>Emily, open this door.</i>

648
00:44:59.039 --> 00:45:01.041
<i>Open this door right now!</i>

649
00:45:07.048 --> 00:45:08.091
Emily.

650
00:45:13.764 --> 00:45:15.766
Emily, what's going on in there?

651
00:45:20.021 --> 00:45:21.063
<i>Emily.</i>

652
00:45:22.231 --> 00:45:23.231
Open the door.

653
00:45:24.358 --> 00:45:26.402
Emily.

654
00:45:30.282 --> 00:45:31.282
<i>Emily!</i>

655
00:45:33.368 --> 00:45:34.578
Emily!

656
00:45:37.915 --> 00:45:39.082
Emily!

657
00:45:46.174 --> 00:45:47.174
Em?

658
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:49.552
Bye-bye.

659
00:45:51.346 --> 00:45:53.766
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

660
00:45:53.808 --> 00:45:55.100
Bye-bye.

661
00:46:00.731 --> 00:46:02.399
Emily?

662
00:46:02.441 --> 00:46:05.111
No more Emily.

663
00:46:05.612 --> 00:46:07.489
What?

664
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.533
Your bitch isn't here anymore.

665
00:46:09.574 --> 00:46:10.784
Stop it.

666
00:46:10.826 --> 00:46:12.703
I'm calling a doctor.

667
00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:16.041
He'll take care of you.

668
00:46:16.082 --> 00:46:18.209
Mmm.
You're not calling anyone.


669
00:46:31.932 --> 00:46:34.142
I think you
killed her, you know.


670
00:46:35.435 --> 00:46:36.979
No.

671
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:38.773
Tara killed herself.

672
00:46:58.086 --> 00:46:59.169
Bye-bye.

673
00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:16.147
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

674
00:47:16.188 --> 00:47:17.189
It's okay.

675
00:47:19.776 --> 00:47:21.986
You have something
to tell me, yes?


676
00:47:22.028 --> 00:47:25.198
Yes. Um... I'm not
sure how to say it.


677
00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:28.201
Is it about Emily?

678
00:47:28.702 --> 00:47:29.828
Yes.

679
00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.748
William,

680
00:47:34.208 --> 00:47:35.668
I have known you
since you were born.


681
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.379
I christened you. I gave
you first Communion.


682
00:47:38.421 --> 00:47:41.215
I saw you graduate
high school and college.


683
00:47:41.257 --> 00:47:42.717
I love you like my own son.

684
00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:45.972
I hope that is unquestionable.

685
00:47:47.514 --> 00:47:49.100
You've always been
there for me, Father.


686
00:47:49.142 --> 00:47:51.144
Then please take
what I'm about to say


687
00:47:51.185 --> 00:47:52.686
in the spirit that it's meant.

688
00:47:55.731 --> 00:47:57.067
You're having second thoughts.

689
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:58.485
And I think they're warranted.

690
00:47:58.526 --> 00:48:00.070
What?

691
00:48:00.112 --> 00:48:03.281
She's not the woman you thought she was.
Am I close?


692
00:48:03.323 --> 00:48:05.450
Yes. But it's more than that.
She's changed.


693
00:48:05.492 --> 00:48:09.080
Yes, well, that happens. The good
thing is, you saw it in time.


694
00:48:09.122 --> 00:48:10.331
No, no.
You don't understand.


695
00:48:10.372 --> 00:48:12.792
I do, I do. Look,
these things happen.


696
00:48:12.834 --> 00:48:16.171
And this is why the marriage
classes are so important.


697
00:48:16.212 --> 00:48:18.214
Look, I'm not here
because I am afraid


698
00:48:18.255 --> 00:48:19.633
that I am marrying
the wrong girl.


699
00:48:19.675 --> 00:48:24.471
I'm here because I believe
that someone or something,


700
00:48:24.513 --> 00:48:26.765
something evil, has
control of her, Father.


701
00:48:28.642 --> 00:48:29.810
She's been unfaithful.

702
00:48:29.852 --> 00:48:31.729
No. God damn it.
No. Listen.


703
00:48:32.271 --> 00:48:33.272
Listen.

704
00:48:34.941 --> 00:48:35.984
I think that...

705
00:48:38.862 --> 00:48:40.279
I think that Emily

706
00:48:42.616 --> 00:48:43.616
is possessed.

707
00:48:45.536 --> 00:48:46.829
"Possessed"?

708
00:48:53.002 --> 00:48:54.254
Hello?

709
00:48:59.843 --> 00:49:01.053
Emily?

710
00:49:13.691 --> 00:49:14.901
Honey?

711
00:49:18.321 --> 00:49:20.490
God, it smells terrible in here.

712
00:49:22.367 --> 00:49:25.495
Emily, you're
really sick, aren't you?


713
00:49:25.537 --> 00:49:28.708
Let me open the window for
you, and get some fresh air.


714
00:49:43.599 --> 00:49:44.641
Emily?

715
00:49:47.811 --> 00:49:49.354
I'm gonna fill up
the tub for you.


716
00:49:55.904 --> 00:49:58.615
Mom.

717
00:49:58.656 --> 00:50:00.658
There must be something
else here at work, Father.


718
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.203
Hold on.

719
00:50:02.245 --> 00:50:06.124
We cannot excuse her
crimes or mental disorders


720
00:50:06.165 --> 00:50:07.917
by screaming
"demonic possession."


721
00:50:07.959 --> 00:50:10.104
You're a priest! You're supposed
to believe in this shit.


722
00:50:10.128 --> 00:50:11.879
Oh...

723
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:13.882
At least take a look at her.

724
00:50:15.425 --> 00:50:17.719
Father,

725
00:50:17.761 --> 00:50:22.224
I am telling you that the woman I
love is possessed by the Devil.


726
00:50:24.435 --> 00:50:27.396
Now, you say that
you love me like a son.


727
00:50:29.065 --> 00:50:31.151
Well, I'm asking
you for your help.


728
00:50:31.192 --> 00:50:33.402
Not your judgment.
Not your jokes. Help.


729
00:50:36.198 --> 00:50:37.366
Father,

730
00:50:40.369 --> 00:50:41.912
will you help me?

731
00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:56.678
Oh, my gosh.
You scared me.


732
00:50:58.181 --> 00:51:00.224
Sweetie, what happened to you?

733
00:51:04.312 --> 00:51:05.855
What did you do?

734
00:51:06.939 --> 00:51:08.440
Why, you poor baby.

735
00:51:10.027 --> 00:51:11.444
Where the hell is William?

736
00:51:11.486 --> 00:51:13.364
He should be here to help you.

737
00:51:13.405 --> 00:51:15.448
Let me get you something, okay?

738
00:51:16.283 --> 00:51:17.450
Emily.

739
00:51:18.952 --> 00:51:20.453
What's all over the...

740
00:51:25.668 --> 00:51:26.668
God.

741
00:51:27.712 --> 00:51:28.838
Okay.

742
00:51:31.383 --> 00:51:32.467
No, no.

743
00:51:33.135 --> 00:51:34.136
No.

744
00:51:36.889 --> 00:51:39.975
No! No! No!

745
00:51:40.017 --> 00:51:42.477
<i>No! No!</i>

746
00:51:48.276 --> 00:51:49.444
No!

747
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.365
No!

748
00:51:53.907 --> 00:51:55.368
No! No!

749
00:51:56.452 --> 00:51:57.494
No.

750
00:52:17.558 --> 00:52:18.893
Where is she?

751
00:53:10.491 --> 00:53:13.327
Sweetie?
Father Avital is here.


752
00:53:32.639 --> 00:53:34.308
He's gonna help us.

753
00:53:35.058 --> 00:53:36.058
William, don't.

754
00:53:52.537 --> 00:53:54.705
Em, what happened?

755
00:53:57.082 --> 00:53:58.842
Did you hurt yourself again?
What's happened?


756
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:04.174
Get away from her.

757
00:54:06.801 --> 00:54:08.011
Talk to me.

758
00:54:09.262 --> 00:54:10.262
William.

759
00:54:11.474 --> 00:54:12.725
That's not her blood.

760
00:54:13.226 --> 00:54:14.352
What?

761
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:20.316
Oh, look.

762
00:54:22.819 --> 00:54:24.613
The marriage coach.

763
00:54:27.657 --> 00:54:30.911
Here to help us
with our cold feet.


764
00:54:32.954 --> 00:54:34.249
Who are you?

765
00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:37.335
You know who I am.

766
00:54:40.255 --> 00:54:41.381
Whose blood is this?

767
00:54:42.673 --> 00:54:44.675
Emily, what have you done?

768
00:54:46.262 --> 00:54:47.763
What I'll do to you.

769
00:54:49.306 --> 00:54:51.183
What I'll do to all of you.

770
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:58.400
I'll drink your blood
and eat your flesh.


771
00:55:01.278 --> 00:55:03.572
You too, Padre.

772
00:55:17.629 --> 00:55:19.465
Do you believe me now?

773
00:55:22.092 --> 00:55:23.343
I think...

774
00:55:26.012 --> 00:55:28.056
I think we should
call the police.


775
00:55:28.098 --> 00:55:29.724
"The police."

776
00:55:30.977 --> 00:55:32.770
She's hurt someone, William.

777
00:55:32.812 --> 00:55:35.356
Probably killed them, by the
amount of blood up there.


778
00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:39.402
And I think we can assume she was
responsible for Tara's death.


779
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.949
The police won't understand.

780
00:56:00.592 --> 00:56:01.843
What language is that?

781
00:56:03.052 --> 00:56:04.095
Latin.

782
00:56:06.015 --> 00:56:07.266
What's she saying?

783
00:56:11.228 --> 00:56:16.652
It's ancient phraseology.
A rough translation would be


784
00:56:16.694 --> 00:56:19.279
"farewell,"
or something more colloquial.


785
00:56:19.988 --> 00:56:21.406
"Bye-bye"?

786
00:56:21.448 --> 00:56:22.574
Yes.

787
00:56:24.909 --> 00:56:26.911
Yes.
She's repeating it in Latin.


788
00:56:26.953 --> 00:56:28.873
She doesn't speak Latin.

789
00:56:31.501 --> 00:56:33.586
Look at me.

790
00:56:33.628 --> 00:56:36.506
I never believed in the Devil
or demons, or any of this shit,


791
00:56:36.548 --> 00:56:39.468
but there is something
else controlling her.


792
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:41.094
Tell me you don't see that.

793
00:56:41.136 --> 00:56:42.804
I do.

794
00:56:42.846 --> 00:56:44.087
What are you gonna do about it?

795
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.977
What would you like me to do?

796
00:56:49.019 --> 00:56:50.020
An exorcism?

797
00:56:51.231 --> 00:56:52.815
Those days are gone.

798
00:56:58.697 --> 00:57:00.741
I need to talk to someone.

799
00:57:02.451 --> 00:57:04.537
You're leaving?

800
00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:06.622
You want answers I don't have.

801
00:57:07.498 --> 00:57:08.538
I need to talk to someone.

802
00:57:10.084 --> 00:57:12.211
Stay away from her, William.
She's dangerous.


803
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:15.507
I'll be back in a while.

804
00:58:02.099 --> 00:58:04.769
Henry? Have you seen Henry?
He's a janitor.


805
00:58:25.082 --> 00:58:26.082
Henry.

806
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:32.424
You?
How are you, Henry?


807
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:35.260
You've got a lot of nerve.

808
00:58:35.302 --> 00:58:37.805
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.


809
00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.139
No.

810
00:58:39.181 --> 00:58:40.932
I'm sure you wouldn't.

811
00:58:42.976 --> 00:58:44.270
What's in the bag?

812
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.941
Peace offering.

813
00:59:14.887 --> 00:59:15.970
Emily?

814
00:59:19.517 --> 00:59:21.352
You hungry?
I made you a sandwich.


815
00:59:24.564 --> 00:59:26.023
I'm scared.

816
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:30.821
I don't know what's going on.

817
00:59:30.863 --> 00:59:32.614
I don't know who
you are anymore.


818
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:35.951
I'm losing you.

819
00:59:39.663 --> 00:59:41.416
<i>Maybe I already have.</i>

820
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:55.598
I love you.

821
01:00:05.066 --> 01:00:07.068
<i>I love you, 
Emily Blair.</i>

822
01:00:15.828 --> 01:00:16.871
William.

823
01:00:17.288 --> 01:00:18.288
Em?

824
01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:22.418
Help me.

825
01:00:25.004 --> 01:00:26.047
How?

826
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.174
How?
Just tell me how.


827
01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:29.593
I don't know.

828
01:00:30.677 --> 01:00:32.053
I don't know.

829
01:00:34.389 --> 01:00:36.057
What's happening to me?

830
01:00:42.356 --> 01:00:44.442
We're gonna make
it through this.


831
01:00:44.484 --> 01:00:46.027
I promise you.

832
01:01:08.635 --> 01:01:10.930
You have to be kidding me.

833
01:01:10.972 --> 01:01:14.350
You understand it.
You know things I don't.


834
01:01:15.476 --> 01:01:17.102
Don't tell me you believe.

835
01:01:17.687 --> 01:01:20.439
Maybe. Yes.

836
01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:23.068
But you didn't believe back
then, when it mattered.


837
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:24.444
No, but you can understand...

838
01:01:24.486 --> 01:01:25.726
When you had me excommunicated.

839
01:01:30.993 --> 01:01:33.538
I did what I thought was best.

840
01:01:33.579 --> 01:01:36.708
You weren't about what's best.

841
01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:40.127
Sitting in your ivory tower, passing
judgment from way up above.


842
01:01:40.169 --> 01:01:42.005
That's what you
never understood, Jimmy.


843
01:01:42.047 --> 01:01:44.967
You can't help
people from way up there.


844
01:01:45.009 --> 01:01:47.260
You have to get down in
the dirt and the mud,


845
01:01:47.302 --> 01:01:49.388
and you have to
get your hands dirty.


846
01:01:49.429 --> 01:01:51.932
You have to sacrifice
some of your own comfort,


847
01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.642
if you want to help people.

848
01:01:53.684 --> 01:01:56.437
Oh. I've heard this sermon
from you before, Henry.


849
01:01:58.189 --> 01:02:00.692
You went against the Church.
You defied the archbishop.


850
01:02:00.734 --> 01:02:02.610
You fell from grace.

851
01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.445
I saved people.

852
01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:06.298
I did more wearing that
collar than you ever did.


853
01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.575
And I could have saved more.

854
01:02:07.616 --> 01:02:10.285
What about the ones
you hurt? Hmm?


855
01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:13.247
You forget about them, Henry.
The ones you hurt.


856
01:02:13.288 --> 01:02:15.083
Look, you may have been right,

857
01:02:16.542 --> 01:02:18.962
but you went about
it the wrong way.


858
01:02:20.047 --> 01:02:22.049
The Church has
rules for a reason.


859
01:02:23.341 --> 01:02:25.427
There's no room for mutiny.

860
01:02:25.468 --> 01:02:29.180
We can't have your kind
of chaos and insanity.


861
01:02:31.684 --> 01:02:33.019
And now you need me?
Oh, jeez.


862
01:02:33.061 --> 01:02:34.604
Now you believe?

863
01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.107
Yes.

864
01:02:37.398 --> 01:02:38.482
Yes.

865
01:02:40.359 --> 01:02:43.196
I need you to
show me how to do it.


866
01:02:44.073 --> 01:02:45.741
Get the fuck out of here.

867
01:02:45.783 --> 01:02:47.928
I'm not going anywhere until you
tell me what I need to know.


868
01:02:49.536 --> 01:02:51.288
You ruined my fucking life!

869
01:02:51.329 --> 01:02:52.329
It was my life, Jimmy.

870
01:02:58.671 --> 01:03:00.214
The past is the past.

871
01:03:02.383 --> 01:03:06.346
Now, right here, in the present
moment, I need your fucking help!


872
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.104
Father.

873
01:03:13.146 --> 01:03:14.855
Who is this?

874
01:03:14.897 --> 01:03:16.733
This is Henry Roizman.

875
01:03:17.651 --> 01:03:19.069
He can help us.

876
01:03:22.447 --> 01:03:24.491
Societal obligation's
getting in the way


877
01:03:24.532 --> 01:03:26.995
of your girlfriend's
demon possession?


878
01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:30.498
It's my dad. He's probably
calling to see how Emily is.


879
01:03:31.166 --> 01:03:33.126
Thoughtful.

880
01:03:33.168 --> 01:03:35.003
I'll let it go to voice-mail.

881
01:03:36.378 --> 01:03:38.256
I think we're out
of the woods, Father.


882
01:03:38.298 --> 01:03:40.176
I spoke to her.
I think she's better.


883
01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:41.551
I told her to come back to me,

884
01:03:41.593 --> 01:03:43.428
and she snapped right out of it.

885
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:44.972
I think it's all gonna be okay.

886
01:05:40.764 --> 01:05:42.057
Sweetie!

887
01:05:43.351 --> 01:05:44.685
Where have you been?

888
01:05:45.436 --> 01:05:46.771
Are you okay?

889
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:49.607
Will, why am I outside?

890
01:05:51.484 --> 01:05:54.154
Why am I dressed like this?

891
01:05:54.195 --> 01:05:55.572
It's okay.
Okay.


892
01:05:55.614 --> 01:05:56.824
I'll get you cleaned up, okay?

893
01:05:56.865 --> 01:05:57.908
Okay, yeah.

894
01:06:11.298 --> 01:06:13.842
What the fuck is he doing here?

895
01:06:16.178 --> 01:06:17.471
Get out!

896
01:06:19.098 --> 01:06:20.724
Get out!

897
01:06:27.398 --> 01:06:29.651
Mmm...

898
01:06:31.945 --> 01:06:33.738
Hello, Roizman.

899
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.448
Grab her.

900
01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:38.076
She's not your girlfriend. She's
a fucking demon. Grab her.


901
01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:52.591
No!

902
01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:58.974
Take it up to the bedroom.
Need some rope, a wire.


903
01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:00.393
Need to tie it down.

904
01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:02.478
Come on!

905
01:07:03.938 --> 01:07:05.481
It'll be pissed when it gets up.

906
01:07:12.447 --> 01:07:14.950
You know my fucking name.

907
01:07:28.298 --> 01:07:30.193
William, what are you doing?
Why are you hurting me?


908
01:07:30.217 --> 01:07:32.510
Em? William, please help me.
Please!


909
01:07:32.552 --> 01:07:34.012
You know my name.

910
01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:35.513
You know who I am.

911
01:07:40.603 --> 01:07:41.883
You know what I do to your kind.

912
01:07:45.108 --> 01:07:47.651
We'll wait till it's weaker.

913
01:07:47.693 --> 01:07:49.947
Hungrier, tired.

914
01:07:49.988 --> 01:07:52.283
And then we'll
exorcise this motherfucker.


915
01:07:52.324 --> 01:07:55.160
You don't
have the strength, Roizman.


916
01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.788
They kicked you out.

917
01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:02.543
Excommunicated.

918
01:08:03.962 --> 01:08:05.505
You're shamed.

919
01:08:08.633 --> 01:08:10.594
You're right.
I don't have the strength.


920
01:08:11.178 --> 01:08:12.554
But he does.

921
01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:20.146
He doesn't believe.

922
01:08:22.357 --> 01:08:23.566
He'll get there.

923
01:08:26.111 --> 01:08:27.737
And when he does,

924
01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:29.906
he'll purge you back to hell,
where you belong.


925
01:08:43.838 --> 01:08:45.719
It's gonna take
three or four sessions.


926
01:08:46.716 --> 01:08:47.777
I can't tell how
many are in there,


927
01:08:47.801 --> 01:08:49.386
but it's probably just one.

928
01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.555
We'll need to tie it down.

929
01:08:51.596 --> 01:08:52.597
Her.

930
01:08:55.017 --> 01:08:56.394
Not "it."

931
01:08:56.436 --> 01:08:57.663
Maybe you're not
paying attention


932
01:08:57.687 --> 01:08:58.956
to what's happening
to your girlfriend here.


933
01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.398
Fiancee.

934
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.942
That thing inside her,

935
01:09:02.984 --> 01:09:05.695
that's a demon that's taking
possession of her soul.


936
01:09:05.736 --> 01:09:07.532
We might be able to
send it back to hell,


937
01:09:07.573 --> 01:09:09.050
but your fiancee
is almost surely dead.


938
01:09:09.074 --> 01:09:10.368
Roizman.

939
01:09:11.369 --> 01:09:12.786
We can save her.

940
01:09:12.828 --> 01:09:14.038
Maybe.

941
01:09:14.079 --> 01:09:15.706
But when we start
driving that demon out,


942
01:09:15.747 --> 01:09:17.708
it's going to start
fighting back hard.


943
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:20.712
All the powers and dark
forces it can muster.


944
01:09:20.753 --> 01:09:22.922
Men die during exorcisms,

945
01:09:22.964 --> 01:09:24.733
killed by creatures like
that thing tied to that bed.


946
01:09:24.757 --> 01:09:25.884
What's wrong?

947
01:09:25.925 --> 01:09:27.260
Take it easy.

948
01:09:28.845 --> 01:09:31.932
And you're gonna have to
consider something, Jimmy.


949
01:09:31.974 --> 01:09:33.869
You're gonna have to consider
what's in front of you.


950
01:09:33.893 --> 01:09:35.562
It's right. I can't
do the exorcism.


951
01:09:35.603 --> 01:09:36.645
It's gonna have to be you.

952
01:09:38.064 --> 01:09:39.500
You're gonna have
to go to confession.


953
01:09:39.524 --> 01:09:41.485
Get yourself pure.

954
01:09:41.527 --> 01:09:43.362
Hold yourself
to a high standard.


955
01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:45.822
Like you did me.

956
01:09:48.658 --> 01:09:51.286
Get your Bible
and your purple stole,


957
01:09:51.328 --> 01:09:52.663
and meet us back
here at sundown.


958
01:10:31.122 --> 01:10:32.498
You confess?

959
01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.125
Yes.
Everything?


960
01:10:35.293 --> 01:10:36.335
You gotta be clean.

961
01:10:36.377 --> 01:10:38.004
I said yes.

962
01:10:39.673 --> 01:10:41.091
All right.

963
01:10:41.133 --> 01:10:42.133
Holy water on all of us.

964
01:10:42.676 --> 01:10:43.927
Bless us all.

965
01:10:52.646 --> 01:10:55.440
May the Lord protect us
as we do his bidding.


966
01:11:00.194 --> 01:11:02.448
The demon inside her,

967
01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:04.908
it has access to
all her memories.


968
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:08.287
It will tell lies to hurt
you, to piss you off.


969
01:11:08.329 --> 01:11:10.038
It wants you to lose control.

970
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.335
If you want your
girlfriend back,


971
01:11:13.376 --> 01:11:15.671
don't let it get
inside your head.


972
01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:17.755
You read me?

973
01:11:19.966 --> 01:11:20.967
Yes.

974
01:11:25.055 --> 01:11:26.599
All right, then.

975
01:11:27.224 --> 01:11:28.309
Let's do this.

976
01:11:34.733 --> 01:11:35.775
Henry.

977
01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:41.948
I'm sorry.

978
01:11:47.205 --> 01:11:48.247
I know.

979
01:11:49.248 --> 01:11:50.791
I know you are.

980
01:12:09.646 --> 01:12:11.773
Move up, both of you.
Face it.


981
01:12:27.873 --> 01:12:31.754
"From all evil,
deliver us, O Lord.


982
01:12:31.795 --> 01:12:34.923
"From all sin, from the
snares of the Devil..."


983
01:12:34.964 --> 01:12:36.216
Cut me loose!

984
01:12:36.258 --> 01:12:37.443
He's here to help you, sweetie.

985
01:12:37.467 --> 01:12:39.135
I'm not your sweetie.

986
01:12:39.177 --> 01:12:42.514
I don't love you,
and I never loved you.


987
01:12:42.556 --> 01:12:44.267
- That's not true.
- Don't listen.


988
01:12:44.308 --> 01:12:45.309
Go on, Jimmy.

989
01:12:48.438 --> 01:12:51.982
"From anger,
hatred and all ill will,


990
01:12:52.024 --> 01:12:56.781
"from all lewdness,
from everlasting death,


991
01:12:56.822 --> 01:12:59.866
"by the mystery
of your holy Incarnation..."


992
01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:01.868
Oh, William.

993
01:13:03.036 --> 01:13:05.289
I have a surprise for you.

994
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:08.084
"By your baptism
and your holy fasting."


995
01:13:08.126 --> 01:13:11.421
Your mommy came to visit
while you were gone.


996
01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:13.923
What?

997
01:13:13.965 --> 01:13:16.426
We had a little girl time.

998
01:13:16.468 --> 01:13:19.388
Don't listen to her.
Pray, damn it. Pray. Do it.


999
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:22.391
It didn't end well.

1000
01:13:22.433 --> 01:13:27.313
I killed her, and then
I broke her in half.


1001
01:13:27.354 --> 01:13:28.607
Oops.

1002
01:13:28.649 --> 01:13:31.901
Your lies will
not move us, Demon.


1003
01:13:31.943 --> 01:13:35.196
Why don't you see
for yourself, preacher?


1004
01:13:35.238 --> 01:13:37.031
She's right over there.

1005
01:13:38.742 --> 01:13:40.077
Don't believe it.

1006
01:13:41.203 --> 01:13:43.414
Don't. William, not now!

1007
01:13:45.207 --> 01:13:46.375
Do it!

1008
01:13:46.876 --> 01:13:48.336
Do it, now!

1009
01:13:48.377 --> 01:13:50.505
Don't do it. Don't.
Stay here.


1010
01:13:50.546 --> 01:13:51.882
William.

1011
01:13:51.923 --> 01:13:53.467
Jimmy.

1012
01:14:02.352 --> 01:14:03.353
Oh, my God.

1013
01:14:07.816 --> 01:14:09.192
Linda.

1014
01:14:09.233 --> 01:14:11.611
"No, no, no. You cannot
call me Linda anymore.


1015
01:14:11.653 --> 01:14:12.987
"Now, it's 'Mom.'"

1016
01:14:20.954 --> 01:14:22.289
Careful, or you let him win.

1017
01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:28.922
You killed my mother.
Mmm-hmm.


1018
01:14:28.963 --> 01:14:31.591
She begged for her life
while I ripped her in half.


1019
01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:43.229
She screamed for mercy,
it was pathetic.


1020
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.069
She told me how
much she loved me.


1021
01:14:50.612 --> 01:14:53.031
William, stop!
Stop it! Stop it!


1022
01:14:54.742 --> 01:14:57.327
It's a shame she won't
be at the wedding.


1023
01:14:57.369 --> 01:15:01.165
At least she got to wear
that dress one last time.


1024
01:15:03.626 --> 01:15:05.336
Bye-bye, lover.

1025
01:15:22.021 --> 01:15:23.481
She killed her.

1026
01:15:23.523 --> 01:15:27.903
No, no. Emily did not kill her.
You must remember that.


1027
01:15:29.028 --> 01:15:31.406
It was whatever
is controlling her.


1028
01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:36.370
We have to stay focused.

1029
01:15:36.412 --> 01:15:38.414
"Focused"?
We have got to go in there


1030
01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:39.958
and finish this.

1031
01:15:41.751 --> 01:15:44.296
My fiancee just
killed my mother.


1032
01:15:44.337 --> 01:15:45.923
I am not finishing anything.

1033
01:15:45.965 --> 01:15:48.008
I am done.

1034
01:15:48.049 --> 01:15:49.409
Hello?

1035
01:15:51.261 --> 01:15:53.680
Good evening, Mr. Regan.
Everything all right?


1036
01:15:53.722 --> 01:15:55.056
Yeah. No.

1037
01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:57.393
Just a bad time.

1038
01:15:57.978 --> 01:16:00.187
Seems like it.

1039
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:02.231
Feel like we're interrupting
something here?


1040
01:16:02.273 --> 01:16:05.109
Detectives, how can we help you?

1041
01:16:05.151 --> 01:16:06.736
- You mind if we look around?
- No!


1042
01:16:06.778 --> 01:16:08.697
Wait. No. Um...

1043
01:16:08.739 --> 01:16:10.950
Do you have a warrant?

1044
01:16:10.992 --> 01:16:13.243
You're a lawyer
or you're a priest?


1045
01:16:13.285 --> 01:16:15.704
You have no warrant.

1046
01:16:15.746 --> 01:16:19.960
And, really, you have no right
to be in this house without one.


1047
01:16:20.002 --> 01:16:22.921
Last night, when
Tara Mendez died,


1048
01:16:22.963 --> 01:16:25.089
you neglected to mention she
called your cell phone.


1049
01:16:27.509 --> 01:16:29.469
Oh, you didn't see that
one coming, did you?


1050
01:16:29.511 --> 01:16:32.849
You had a minute-long conversation
at 1:00 in the morning.


1051
01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:34.701
Ten minutes later, she's dead,
and you're in her house.


1052
01:16:34.725 --> 01:16:35.810
Can you explain that to me?

1053
01:16:37.353 --> 01:16:39.153
Listen, I... EMILY: Help me.

1054
01:16:40.481 --> 01:16:41.566
What was that?
Help me.


1055
01:16:43.276 --> 01:16:44.796
Wait. Put your hands up.
Put your hands up.


1056
01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.088
- Just sit down.
- Hey, hey, hey.


1057
01:16:46.112 --> 01:16:47.465
I wouldn't go up
there if I were you.


1058
01:16:47.489 --> 01:16:49.033
You, shut it.

1059
01:16:49.074 --> 01:16:51.451
Sit on the couch, everyone.
On the couch. Now!


1060
01:16:57.416 --> 01:16:58.543
Oh, my God.

1061
01:16:58.584 --> 01:16:59.752
Help me, please.

1062
01:17:03.089 --> 01:17:05.634
Ma'am, don't be afraid.
I'm here to help.


1063
01:17:05.676 --> 01:17:06.677
Okay?
They hurt me.


1064
01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:08.470
I know. I know.

1065
01:17:08.512 --> 01:17:10.180
Henson!

1066
01:17:10.222 --> 01:17:12.683
Call in backup
and get an ambulance!


1067
01:17:12.725 --> 01:17:14.393
Thank you.

1068
01:17:14.434 --> 01:17:17.230
Okay. You're safe now.

1069
01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:21.359
We need backup and a bus
at 414 Freakin Drive.


1070
01:17:32.454 --> 01:17:33.789
Bastards!

1071
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:35.875
Thank you so much.
Detective.


1072
01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.920
That girl is dangerous.
Shut up!


1073
01:17:37.961 --> 01:17:39.504
You're going to jail.
Cuff them.


1074
01:17:42.632 --> 01:17:43.675
Oh, shit, Miller.

1075
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:47.178
Deliver us,
O Lord, from all evil.


1076
01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.430
Shoot her!
No!


1077
01:17:48.471 --> 01:17:49.783
- No, you're wrong.
- From your wrath.


1078
01:17:49.807 --> 01:17:51.142
- Can't get a shot!
- Emily!


1079
01:17:52.184 --> 01:17:54.478
Deliver us, Lord, from sin.
Shoot her!


1080
01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520
Shoot her!

1081
01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.024
Roizman!
Henry!


1082
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:10.913
No!

1083
01:18:38.777 --> 01:18:39.987
Kill me.

1084
01:18:41.571 --> 01:18:42.656
Go ahead.

1085
01:18:43.406 --> 01:18:44.992
Kill me.
William, no!


1086
01:18:45.033 --> 01:18:46.511
Do it. FATHER AVITAL:
You mustn't say that.


1087
01:18:46.535 --> 01:18:47.870
Emily's gone.

1088
01:18:48.704 --> 01:18:51.290
I can see that now.

1089
01:18:51.332 --> 01:18:53.960
I protected this
evil thing for too long.


1090
01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:57.255
Allowed it to kill
way too many people.


1091
01:18:58.423 --> 01:18:59.508
So do it.

1092
01:19:00.843 --> 01:19:02.094
Just end it.

1093
01:19:04.638 --> 01:19:05.931
Kill me!

1094
01:19:24.368 --> 01:19:26.078
Where are you going?

1095
01:19:28.455 --> 01:19:29.498
Get back here.

1096
01:19:31.501 --> 01:19:33.294
Get back here, damn it!

1097
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.090
Kill me!

1098
01:19:37.132 --> 01:19:38.925
Call an ambulance.
No, no.


1099
01:19:38.967 --> 01:19:40.903
But... ROIZMAN: No, Jimmy.
No, no, no, no. Jimmy, no.


1100
01:19:40.927 --> 01:19:42.345
We have to save her.

1101
01:19:42.387 --> 01:19:43.723
She's still alive!

1102
01:19:44.765 --> 01:19:47.018
- Emily's gone.
- No.


1103
01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.728
The demon couldn't kill you.

1104
01:19:48.769 --> 01:19:50.104
Emily wouldn't let it.

1105
01:19:50.146 --> 01:19:52.065
She's in there.
She needs you, William.


1106
01:19:52.106 --> 01:19:53.984
Jimmy can't do it on his own.

1107
01:19:54.026 --> 01:19:57.112
She needs you to help free her.

1108
01:19:57.154 --> 01:20:00.074
But we can't do it here.
This house is tainted.


1109
01:20:00.115 --> 01:20:02.784
We gotta find hallowed ground.
Hallowed ground?


1110
01:20:02.826 --> 01:20:05.454
But we gotta go.
We gotta move now.


1111
01:20:05.496 --> 01:20:07.790
The police called it in.
Backup's on its way.


1112
01:20:09.792 --> 01:20:12.254
We gotta get her to a church
and drag that demon out,


1113
01:20:12.295 --> 01:20:14.630
or all of this
will be for nothing.


1114
01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.051
It wasn't Emily.

1115
01:20:17.093 --> 01:20:18.177
It wasn't her.

1116
01:20:18.219 --> 01:20:19.386
It was that thing inside her.

1117
01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:00.306
Get her inside.

1118
01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:27.713
There's two more
bodies upstairs.


1119
01:21:27.738 --> 01:21:29.129
One of them is Malach.

1120
01:21:29.171 --> 01:21:31.631
Rampart.

1121
01:21:31.673 --> 01:21:34.509
We're at the scene.
We've got multiple 187s.


1122
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:36.553
Release APB.
Send backup. Over.


1123
01:21:36.595 --> 01:21:38.389
<i>Roger, 1
-Adam-12.</i>

1124
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:41.100
<i>We'll triangulate suspect's cell
phone and report. Five minutes.</i>


1125
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:56.033
What's happening?

1126
01:21:59.871 --> 01:22:01.164
Stay back.

1127
01:23:03.064 --> 01:23:06.525
I've been
waiting for this for so long.


1128
01:23:14.159 --> 01:23:15.159
Roizman!

1129
01:23:36.267 --> 01:23:37.768
He's breathing.
Okay.


1130
01:23:49.906 --> 01:23:50.907
Emily?

1131
01:23:55.955 --> 01:23:57.290
Be careful.

1132
01:23:58.582 --> 01:24:00.293
I know you can hear me.

1133
01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.169
I know you're in there.

1134
01:24:10.095 --> 01:24:11.697
Speak
from the heart, William.


1135
01:24:11.721 --> 01:24:13.161
Let her know what
she's fighting for.


1136
01:24:14.976 --> 01:24:16.602
We're gonna win this.

1137
01:24:16.644 --> 01:24:18.396
You and me, together.

1138
01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.108
William!

1139
01:24:25.111 --> 01:24:26.489
William!

1140
01:24:43.756 --> 01:24:44.757
Emily.

1141
01:24:45.592 --> 01:24:47.177
You and me, Priest.

1142
01:24:49.347 --> 01:24:50.639
Emily, William loves you.

1143
01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.017
He loves you!

1144
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.994
Help us, Lord.
And deliver us from evil.


1145
01:25:11.036 --> 01:25:13.664
You will not have him, Demon.
And go to hell.


1146
01:25:16.918 --> 01:25:18.461
You first.

1147
01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:24.676
Henry!

1148
01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.639
Henry.

1149
01:25:29.515 --> 01:25:30.682
Henry.

1150
01:25:34.187 --> 01:25:36.731
"From all evil,
deliver us, O Lord.


1151

"From all sin, from your wrath,

1152

"from the snares
of the Devil, from..."


1153
01:25:47.993 --> 01:25:51.747
Roizman was right about you.

1154
01:25:53.541 --> 01:25:57.879
Roizman is dead because of you.

1155
01:25:58.755 --> 01:26:02.593
What do you know about sin?

1156
01:26:05.679 --> 01:26:09.725
You stand on your
moral high ground,


1157
01:26:10.768 --> 01:26:15.231
preaching your pathetic sins.

1158
01:26:15.273 --> 01:26:21.489
I am the sin that
purges weakness.


1159
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:27.411
I provide sanction for those
deserving of the Devil's rule.


1160
01:26:29.121 --> 01:26:30.372
Now

1161
01:26:31.791 --> 01:26:37.422
you will pay for your wasted
lifetime of weakness.


1162
01:26:40.592 --> 01:26:45.556
My snare is your only salvation.

1163
01:26:48.601 --> 01:26:51.688
"From anger and
hatred and all ill will,


1164

of earthquakes.


1166

"By the mystery
of your holy Incarnation..."


1167
01:27:08.956 --> 01:27:11.101
"You have to
get down in the mud and the dirt,


1168
01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:13.169
"and you have to
get your hands dirty.

"You have to sacrifice
some of your own comfort,

1171
01:27:24.181 --> 01:27:25.349
I love you, Emily Blair.

1172
01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:28.395
<i>I love how you
like to hold hands.</i>


1173
01:27:28.436 --> 01:27:30.689
<i>I love how you are with kids.</i>

1174
01:27:30.731 --> 01:27:32.940
<i>I love that you ride
your bike in the rain,</i>


1175
01:27:32.982 --> 01:27:35.151
and that sunlight
makes you sneeze.


1176
01:27:38.154 --> 01:27:40.408
<i>I love you.
I love how you kiss.</i>

<i>"By your
coming, by your birth."</i>


1178
01:27:42.702 --> 01:27:43.762
I love how you
always taste so sweet.


1179
01:27:43.786 --> 01:27:45.496
"By your baptism
and holy fasting."


1180
01:28:03.266 --> 01:28:04.434
"Cross and passion."

1181
01:28:04.475 --> 01:28:05.727
I love how you bite your lip

1182
01:28:05.769 --> 01:28:07.650
when you're nervous.
"By your death and burial."


1183
01:28:12.942 --> 01:28:15.237
William. William!

1184
01:28:15.279 --> 01:28:19.825
I'm losing my desire
not to hurt you, William.


1185
01:28:19.866 --> 01:28:25.540
"By your purity, by your conviction.
By your carrying your cross.

1187

1188
01:28:38.387 --> 01:28:40.108
I love that you leave
the lights on all day.


1189
01:28:40.139 --> 01:28:41.825
"By your
miraculous resurrection."


1190
01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:44.268
And I love that
a full moon makes you cry.


1191
01:28:46.353 --> 01:28:47.773
It's working.

1192
01:28:47.815 --> 01:28:48.999
Police! Open up!

1193
01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:51.067
Don't stop!
Don't stop!


1194
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:52.778
"By your
wondrous ascension..."


1195
01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.046
I love that you
agreed to marry me.

"By the coming of
the Holy Spirit."

my life is not worth living without you.
"we beg you to hear us."

"That you spare us,

You make me better.

1205
01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:14.885
I need you to fight now.

1206
01:29:14.926 --> 01:29:17.387
"Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

it is in heaven."</i>


1208
01:29:20.015 --> 01:29:21.685
Fight for me.
Fight for us!


1209
01:29:25.021 --> 01:29:27.023
Open up
this door now. Open up!


1210
01:29:27.064 --> 01:29:29.984
Deliver us from evil!
I love you, Emily.


1211
01:29:30.026 --> 01:29:31.944
Deliver us from evil.
I love you, Emily.


1212
01:29:33.155 --> 01:29:34.699
I love you, Emily!

1213
01:30:42.313 --> 01:30:43.356
Freeze!

1214
01:30:43.398 --> 01:30:44.959
Put your hands behind
your head right now!


1215
01:30:44.983 --> 01:30:47.127
You're under arrest. You
have the right to remain silent.


1216
01:30:47.151 --> 01:30:48.880
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.


1217
01:30:48.904 --> 01:30:50.614
You have the right to an...

1218
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:13.138
Move forward slowly. Slowly.
Don't make any false moves.


1219
01:31:13.179 --> 01:31:15.642
I can explain
everything, Officers.


1220
01:31:19.186 --> 01:31:20.563
I'm crazy.

1221
01:31:20.605 --> 01:31:22.064
Society must be
protected from me.


1222
01:31:25.819 --> 01:31:28.030
I know it isn't this simple.

1223
01:31:28.071 --> 01:31:30.866
And I know those two kids
had something to do with it.


1224
01:31:30.908 --> 01:31:32.994
Why are you taking it all on?

1225
01:31:34.369 --> 01:31:36.998
You probably
won't understand this,


1226
01:31:37.624 --> 01:31:40.418
but sometimes,

1227
01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:45.173
one has to be selfless and make
sacrifices for the greater good.


1228
01:31:45.214 --> 01:31:47.133
And what the hell is
that supposed to mean?


1229
01:31:49.512 --> 01:31:52.348
You wanna do good in this world?

1230
01:31:52.389 --> 01:31:54.308
You gotta get your hands dirty.

1231
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:57.310
Whatever.

1232
01:34:48.622 --> 01:34:51.292
I can't say I like what
you've done with the place.
