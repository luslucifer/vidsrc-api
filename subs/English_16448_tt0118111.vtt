1
00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:24.662
First of all, I want
to thank everybody for coming,


2
00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:26.411
Giving up your lunch hours
and all that.


3
00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:30.495
Lord knows, it's very exciting for all of us.
- Happy to be here.


4
00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:31.624
Oh, me too.
- Absolutely.


5
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.420
Let's get into it. Who wants to start?
- I'll be happy to start.


6
00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:38.002
Gwen, why don't you start?
Okay.


7
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.428
You don't need the pointer?
- No.


8
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.927
I'll hold it.
She's fine. Gwen?


9
00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.759
A concern I have that
I think needs addressing...


10
00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.471
Is that we can't have the
port-o-potties too far off the main route,

11
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:51.352
Because we have
a lot of seniors.


12
00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:52.978
We've solved that.

13
00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:55.902
We're gonna take the port-o-potties
and put 'em right over here.

14
00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:57.149
They're not gonna be
in the way.


15
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.654
We're gonna put a
receptacle near arts and crafts.

16
00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:02.450
- These are big bins?
- Yeah.


17
00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.780
We've got barrels. We're gonna
put barrels on every corner.


18
00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.160
- That's the crate?
- That's the big barrel.


19
00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:12.211
That's the big barrel, 'cause you got pie eating here.
- It's a dumpster.


20
00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:15.004
If anything happens like last
year, with that pie eating...


21
00:01:15.217 --> 00:01:17.754
Which brings me..
- Security.


22
00:01:18.303 --> 00:01:22.592
- Oh...
- I say we put a-a rifle on here,


23
00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:25.595
- A man with a rifle here and a rifle here.
- Oh, please.


24
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:28.018
- Protect the whole square.
- Is that really necessary?


25
00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:31.680
- Yes. Remember how much we got egged last year?
- Absolutely.


26
00:01:31.942 --> 00:01:33.728
What can I tell you,
we're pleased as punch.


27
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.477
We are so proud.

28
00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:40.110
Whatever we do is a first for
Blaine and a first for Missouri.


29
00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.234
Whatever we do is going to be
the standard against which...


30
00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:46.991
All other sesquicentennials...
that's the 150...


31
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.154
Will be judged.

32
00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:51.249
The people of Blaine
are can-do people.


33
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:53.543
There's an old saying
in Missouri:


34
00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:55.837
"If you don't like the weather,
just wait five minutes."


35
00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.760
In Blaine, I honestly believe with hard work we
can get that down to three or four minutes.


36
00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:05.681
Here in our sesquicentennial year,
we've gota lot to talk about.


37
00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.634
There's a lot to be proud of.
And we're very proud of it.


38
00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:10.845
It's about time the world
knows more about Blaine.


39
00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:14.097
We're chompin' at the bit from
this end to get it out there.


40
00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.193
It all started, uh,
with Blaine Fabin.


41
00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.145
He was hired
by thirty settlers...


42
00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:23.319
To lead a wagon train expedition
from Philadelphia to California.


43
00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:25.658
On the fourteenth night,
word has it,


44
00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.532
They were sitting
around the campfire.


45
00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.830
And Blaine said,
"Do you smell it?


46
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:31.747
Do you smell
the salt in the air?"


47
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.201
He said, "We're here.
I've brought you to California."


48
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:37.003
There was a big party that night.
Next morning they got up.


49
00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:40.253
They didn't see the ocean,

50
00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.084
Because they were
in Missouri.


51
00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:45.967
Uh, Blaine was able to convince
them for a little while...


52
00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:47.468
That it was just
low tide and things.


53
00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:50.141
But he had made some mistakes, bad weather,

54
00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:52.560
Wasn't familiar
with the proper route.


55
00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:55.981
But everybody was happy
where they were.


56
00:02:56.193 --> 00:02:58.559
They said, "It's okay we didn't make it
to California. We'll stay here."


57
00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.111
And that's why
I'm at this desk.


58
00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:03.480
Well, I'm
very proud to say...


59
00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:06.529
I'm a direct descendant
of Blaine Fabin.


60
00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.827
I've lived here
all my life, uh,


61
00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:12.994
As did my parents and
their parents and their parents...

62
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.121
And so on and so forth.

63
00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:17.369
I'm very excited
about the show coming up,


64
00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:21.423
Because it'll be the first time
I'll have the experience...


65
00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:25.969
Of sitting in the audience
and seeing actors portray...


66
00:03:26.223 --> 00:03:30.136
My ancestor,
the actual Blaine Fabin.


67
00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:32.182
Being a Fabin...

68
00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:33.885
Is not always easy.

69
00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:38.098
Um, I can certainly understand
how the Kennedys feel.


70
00:03:39.277 --> 00:03:41.268
I had been living in New York...

71
00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.024
And working there
as an actor...


72
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.232
And director and choreographer
for twenty five years or so.


73
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:48.908
And I really felt
I needed a change.


74
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.532
I imagined in my fantasy,
I suppose,


75
00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:54.285
That when I came here,

76
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.583
I would have
a completely different life;


77
00:03:56.795 --> 00:04:01.539
Uh, perhaps, um,
a construction worker...


78
00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:03.840
Or one of those guys
that works on those...


79
00:04:04.135 --> 00:04:07.343
High-wire things that, uh...
with the hard hat.


80
00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:09.922
You know, that
sweeping sort of hat.


81
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:12.257
And, uh, with the chaps.

82
00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:15.267
Uh, but that didn't
really work out.


83
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.811
I began to realize,
I guess,


84
00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:19.639
That the theater
was still in my blood.


85
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.351
What I had to do
was make use of that.


86
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:26.155
So I offered my services
to the high school here.


87
00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:30.071
And they accepted.
And I began to teach drama.


88
00:04:30.287 --> 00:04:34.371
And within about six months,
I had formed the Blaine community players.


89
00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:36.414
I gotta tell you,
we are very, very excited...


90
00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:39.743
About the big show that's happening
at the end of the festival.

91
00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:43.672
Everyone right now is just going
crazy getting ready to audition.


92
00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:46.667
And, unfortunately,
I won't be able to audition.


93
00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:49.757
We have to stock that day
and can't get out of it.


94
00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:52.931
And Corky will not let me
audition any other time.


95
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:55.433
"That's show business,"
is what he told me,


96
00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:58.637
And, uh, you know, he's the master.
You gotta give him credit for that.


97
00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.105
President McKinley
did a whistle-stop tour...


98
00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:02.979
Back in 1898.

99
00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:06.440
A little boy, Jimmy McBean,
made a stool for him.


100
00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:09.398
And he loved it so much
that he called back and said,


101
00:05:09.618 --> 00:05:12.405
"Look, I would like to give more
of these to dignitaries who are visiting."

102
00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:15.078
And before you knew it,

103
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.657
Uh, Blaine is manufacturing
all these footstools.


104
00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:23.204
And that's how the big... that's
how we got the stool boom.

105
00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.755
Blaine became
the stool capital of the world.


106
00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:31.131
My first show was Barefoot in the park,
which was an absolute smash.


107
00:05:31.348 --> 00:05:34.340
But my production
on the stage of Backdraft...


108
00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:36.550
Was what really
got them excited.


109
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.354
This whole idea
of "in-your-face theater"...


110
00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:42.101
Really affected them.

111
00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:45.101
The conceptualization,
the whole abstraction,


112
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.276
The obtuseness
of this production, to me,


113
00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:48.820
Was what was interesting.

114
00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:51.648
I wanted the audience
to feel the heat...


115
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.866
From the fire, the fear.

116
00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:57.162
Because people
don't like fire poked...


117
00:05:57.374 --> 00:05:58.659
Poked in their noses.

118
00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.787
You get a cinder from barbecue
on the end of your nose,


119
00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:03.413
And you kind of make
that little face.


120
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.120
That's not a good thing.

121
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.797
I wanted to have
the sense memory of that.


122
00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.419
So during the show,

123
00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:12.217
I had someone
burn newspapers...


124
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.842
And send it through
the vents in the theater.


125
00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:17.265
Well, they freaked out.

126
00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.308
Of course,
the fire marshal came over.


127
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.853
They shut us down
for a couple of days.


128
00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.144
Mr. Bluestein, Montezuma's
revenge is nothing more...


129
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.102
Than good, old-fashioned,
American diarrhea.


130
00:06:28.446 --> 00:06:31.984
Adult diapers should never
even enter the picture.


131
00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:34.608
So you lose
a few pounds.


132
00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:37.448
My mom used to say
that Blaine is...


133
00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:41.373
A little town with a big heart
in the heart of a big country.


134
00:06:42.043 --> 00:06:44.204
And to me, Blaine
is a kind of town...


135
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:46.787
Where I can have
my own business,


136
00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:50.298
Meet and marry a wonderful
woman like Sheila...


137
00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:54.511
- A-and be something, be somebody.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.


138
00:06:54.723 --> 00:06:56.429
Some people
find it ironical that,


139
00:06:56.641 --> 00:06:59.724
Though we run a travel agency,
we've never been outside Blaine.


140
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.229
With one exception.
- Well, we've never been out...


141
00:07:05.316 --> 00:07:07.352
Well, I went
to Jefferson City once.


142
00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:09.105
- It was a...
- Tell them why.


143
00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:11.319
It was a medical reason.

144
00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.613
You can tell them.

145
00:07:15.243 --> 00:07:16.528
Just minor surgery.

146
00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.914
I've been workin' here
at the D.Q. For about,


147
00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:24.957
Um,

148
00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:30.876
Eight months, seven.

149
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:33.883
I don't know.
Somethin' like that. It's fun.


150
00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.419
You just do the cones,

151
00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:38.512
Make sundaes, make blizzards...

152
00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:40.841
And put stuff on 'em.

153
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:43.598
And see a lot
of people come in.


154
00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:45.804
A lot of people
come to the D.Q.


155
00:07:46.024 --> 00:07:48.265
Burgers, ice cream,

156
00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:50.650
Anything, you know?

157
00:07:52.113 --> 00:07:55.605
Cokes. Just drive in and
get a coke if you're thirsty.


158
00:07:57.035 --> 00:07:59.902
Everybody thinks that Roswell
was the first sighting...


159
00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:01.611
Of a U.F.O.
In the United States.


160
00:08:01.831 --> 00:08:05.824
And that's bull-roar. We had
the first sighting here in 1946.


161
00:08:06.044 --> 00:08:08.126
And it wasn't just a sighting.
It didn't just fly by.


162
00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:09.956
They stopped,
and they landed.


163
00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:13.753
The people in Blaine went on
board the ship for a potluck dinner.

164
00:08:14.552 --> 00:08:18.795
I've been coming to this landing
site every day for two years...


165
00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:20.717
To measure it.

166
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:22.807
And here's the thing:

167
00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:25.594
The circumference
and the diameter...


168
00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:27.896
Change by a few inches,

169
00:08:28.358 --> 00:08:30.474
Yet the radius
remains the same.


170
00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:33.102
Which brings me back
to the number five.


171
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:36.279
There are five letters
in the name "Blaine."


172
00:08:36.658 --> 00:08:38.990
Mix the word "Blaine" up.
Mix it around.


173
00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.067
Eventually
you'll get "Nebali."


174
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:44.116
Nebali, the name
of the planet...


175
00:08:44.332 --> 00:08:47.415
In a galaxy way, way,

176
00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.618
Way far away.

177
00:08:49.838 --> 00:08:53.001
Once you step
inside this circle,


178
00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:55.965
The weather never changes.

179
00:08:56.177 --> 00:08:58.759
It is always 67 degrees...

180
00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:02.135
With a 40 % chance
of rain, always.


181
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.425
I
-I love to make people laugh.

182
00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:09.263
And I've been doing it since,
you know, school.


183
00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:12.019
People ask me,
"Were you, uh, were...


184
00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:14.851
You must have been
the class clown."


185
00:09:15.363 --> 00:09:18.196
And I say, uh,
"No, I wasn't."


186
00:09:19.617 --> 00:09:23.576
But I sat beside the class clown,
and I studied him...


187
00:09:23.788 --> 00:09:27.451
And saw how he made
people laugh.


188
00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.874
And... and so I picked
some things up.


189
00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:32.543
And, you know, at parties
and family functions,


190
00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:36.464
I have to say, I love,
you know, breaking people up.


191
00:09:36.718 --> 00:09:38.208
So there's a thing...

192
00:09:38.428 --> 00:09:41.545
I think I got
an entertaining bug...


193
00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:45.515
From my grandfather,
Chaim Pearlgut,


194
00:09:45.727 --> 00:09:48.389
Who was very, very big
in the, uh,


195
00:09:48.646 --> 00:09:50.978
Yiddish theater
back in New York.


196
00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:55.150
He was in the very...
the sardonically irreverent...


197
00:09:55.987 --> 00:09:59.275
"Dybbuk shmybbuk,
I said, 'more ham."'


198
00:10:00.074 --> 00:10:03.032
And that revue,
I believe, was 1914.


199
00:10:03.244 --> 00:10:06.407
And that revue
is what made him famous.


200
00:10:06.664 --> 00:10:10.498
Incidentally, the song,
"Bubbe made a kishke"...


201
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.246
Came from that revue.

202
00:10:12.462 --> 00:10:13.497
My-my father...

203
00:10:14.297 --> 00:10:16.629
Bless him... brought me
into the business.


204
00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:19.708
This was
his dental practice before.


205
00:10:19.928 --> 00:10:22.169
And I joke with
my wife that, you know,


206
00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.674
At that point,
that's when the, uh,


207
00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:28.975
The money started,
uh, rolling in, you know.


208
00:10:30.521 --> 00:10:32.102
"Brave making...

209
00:10:32.815 --> 00:10:35.477
"More wampum
to buy pelts.


210
00:10:38.988 --> 00:10:41.604
"One happy squaw
in wigwam.


211
00:10:41.824 --> 00:10:44.190
Happy as mongoose."

212
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:46.571
That, uh,

213
00:10:47.538 --> 00:10:49.153
Is, of course,
from Johnny Carson,


214
00:10:49.374 --> 00:10:52.912
Who, uh... one of my heroes
in a very funny bit.


215
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.910
# When I see lips #

216
00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:57.336
# Waitin' to be kissed #

217
00:10:57.674 --> 00:10:59.039
# I can't stop #

218
00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:02.217
# I can't stop
for that lightnin' #


219
00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:04.589
# Oh, it's strikin' #

220
00:11:04.806 --> 00:11:06.012
# Again #

221
00:11:06.724 --> 00:11:07.509
Yeah.

222
00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:11.551
# Lightnin' strikin' #

223
00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:15.309
# Again and again
and again and... #


224
00:11:19.237 --> 00:11:22.604
I'm gonna do a scene
from the movie, raging bull.


225
00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:27.822
"You fucked my wife?"
"What?"


226
00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:32.618
"You fucked my wife?"
"How can you ask me a question like that?


227
00:11:32.834 --> 00:11:35.371
"How can you ask me? I'm
your brother, and you ask me?


228
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.626
Where do you get balls
big enough to ask me that?"


229
00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:40.671
Basically,
for the last fifteen years,


230
00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:43.374
I have been
the music teacher...


231
00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:45.926
At, uh, Blaine High.

232
00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:47.629
Um, and...

233
00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:50.511
Part of my job,
and a very important part,


234
00:11:50.727 --> 00:11:52.342
Is to put on
a show every year,


235
00:11:52.562 --> 00:11:54.894
Which I have done
completely by myself.


236
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.346
This year it's
going to be different.


237
00:11:57.567 --> 00:12:00.809
Because Corky, uh,
being from New York,


238
00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:03.190
Being a professional, uh,

239
00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:04.316
And having put on...

240
00:12:04.532 --> 00:12:09.196
Some very theatrical
productions here,


241
00:12:09.412 --> 00:12:10.527
Uh,

242
00:12:10.747 --> 00:12:13.864
Is going to be directing
the show this year.


243
00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:18.167
And I'm going to be the musical director,
which is different for me.


244
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:23.877
# Teacher's pet #

245
00:12:24.635 --> 00:12:27.627
# I wanna be teacher's pet #

246
00:12:28.473 --> 00:12:31.761
# I wanna be
huddled and cuddled #


247
00:12:31.976 --> 00:12:34.388
# As close to you
as I can get #


248
00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:39.480
# Teacher's pride #

249
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:42.938
# I wanna be
teacher's pride #


250
00:12:50.828 --> 00:12:51.908
Dr. Pearl!

251
00:12:52.163 --> 00:12:54.028
How are you? Ron Albertson.
- Yes, Ron.


252
00:12:54.248 --> 00:12:56.489
My wife, Sheila. You remember
her from previous bills.


253
00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.165
Yes.

254
00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:00.619
- Hello, Sheila.
- What are you doing here?


255
00:13:00.838 --> 00:13:03.955
I'm here, uh, you know,
trying out for the show.


256
00:13:04.175 --> 00:13:06.666
- Congratulations.
- No, why are you here?


257
00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.969
I'm try... I told my wife
I'd come out for this show.


258
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:12.547
And, you know, I thought
I'd give it a shot, yes.


259
00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:15.304
A shot, which won't be
the first shot you ever gave.


260
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.636
Hope it doesn't
leave Corky numb.


261
00:13:17.855 --> 00:13:19.891
It's like pulling teeth
to get a discount from him.


262
00:13:20.108 --> 00:13:23.771
Hey, give some caramels to the little girl.
Future customers.


263
00:13:24.362 --> 00:13:26.193
# So I can be #

264
00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:27.862
# Teacher's pet #

265
00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:31.070
# Long after
school is through #


266
00:13:31.702 --> 00:13:34.364
# Teacher, teacher
I love you #


267
00:13:35.498 --> 00:13:36.112
Whoa!

268
00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:46.543
Maybe just...

269
00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:49.125
# I dream #

270
00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:55.011
# Of Jeannie
with the light brown hair #


271
00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:59.136
# Floating like a vapor #

272
00:13:59.355 --> 00:14:03.849
# On the soft summer air #

273
00:14:04.068 --> 00:14:06.901
Look out!
# Camptown races sing this song #


274
00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:08.899
# Doo-dah, doo-dah #

275
00:14:09.073 --> 00:14:10.859
# Camptown racetrack
five miles long #


276
00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:14.655
# Oh, doo-dah-day
goin' to run all night #


277
00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:16.532
# Goin' to run all day #

278
00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:20.410
# Bet my money on the bobtailed nag
somebody bet on the bay #


279
00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:24.118
# Bay, bay, bay #

280
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.420
# Way down
upon the Swanee River #


281
00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:39.847
# Floating like #

282
00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:42.223
# A vapor #

283
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.900
# On the soft summer #

284
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:53.778
# A... #

285
00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:58.077
# Air #

286
00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.281
- Very nice. Very good.
- Very, very... that was very good.


287
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.543
Well, thank you, Dr. Pearl.
- Thank you very much.


288
00:15:05.963 --> 00:15:07.749
- Thank you, and...
- We'll let you know.


289
00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:10.460
- Very good.
- Thank you.


290
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.670
Thank you.

291
00:15:14.388 --> 00:15:16.174
- He's good. He's good.
- He can actually sing.


292
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.096
Wow.
- Very nice.


293
00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:19.389
Albertsons?

294
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.940
Ding dong.

295
00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:36.695
Oh, I wonder who knows I'm
vacationing here at the oasis.


296
00:15:38.412 --> 00:15:40.027
- Am I late?
- You!


297
00:15:40.248 --> 00:15:43.115
- Surprised?
- How did you find me?


298
00:15:43.334 --> 00:15:44.699
I have my ways.

299
00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:47.410
Would you like
to come in for coffee?


300
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.963
# You don't need
to answer #


301
00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:53.416
# There's no need
to speak #


302
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.593
# I'll be
your belly dancer #


303
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:01.595
# Prancer #

304
00:16:01.811 --> 00:16:04.644
# And I will be
your sheik #


305
00:16:04.855 --> 00:16:08.439
# I don't need
a harem, honey #


306
00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:11.521
# When you're
by my side #


307
00:16:12.655 --> 00:16:15.988
# And you won't need
a camel #


308
00:16:16.242 --> 00:16:17.607
# No, no #

309
00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:20.234
# When I take you
for a ride #


310
00:16:21.163 --> 00:16:23.245
We'll need some coffee to go with that ride,
won't we?


311
00:16:23.457 --> 00:16:26.494
You're always
full of surprises.


312
00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:30.040
- But, say, I wonder, do we have time for that coffee?
- What time is it?


313
00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:32.998
What time is it?
Haven't you been paying attention? It's...


314
00:16:33.217 --> 00:16:38.553
# Midnight at the oasis #

315
00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.925
- Oh. Good.
- Thank you.


316
00:16:41.142 --> 00:16:43.053
That was great.

317
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.225
- Really good.
- Thanks a lot.


318
00:16:46.147 --> 00:16:47.603
Thanks for coming.

319
00:16:48.274 --> 00:16:50.640
Should we leave the...
no, put that back.


320
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.566
- Strike it?
- Yeah.


321
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.652
We've done shows for Corky, so we know the terms already.
- Thank you.


322
00:16:55.823 --> 00:16:59.361
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much. It was fun.


323
00:16:59.869 --> 00:17:02.827
Thank you.
- Wow.


324
00:17:03.831 --> 00:17:04.866
I'm feeling good...

325
00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:07.956
About where we stand now
with our cast.


326
00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:11.036
"I think that the elements,"

327
00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:13.879
As Dr. Watson said
to Sherlock,


328
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:15.627
"Are coming together, sir."

329
00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:18.881
I'm very excited
about Ron and Sheila,


330
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:21.212
The old standbys,
the workhorses.


331
00:17:21.432 --> 00:17:23.172
I call them
lunts of Blaine.


332
00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:27.886
Allan Pearl. How do these p...
where do they come from?


333
00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:29.679
Sure, I'd seen him around.

334
00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:31.890
It would never have occurred
to me to walk up to the...


335
00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:35.480
Dentist and say, you know,
"Are you interested in this?"


336
00:17:35.696 --> 00:17:37.812
But I was...

337
00:17:38.032 --> 00:17:39.772
Shopping for my wife,
Bonnie.


338
00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:42.153
I buy most of her clothes.

339
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.657
And Mrs. Pearl...

340
00:17:45.873 --> 00:17:47.534
Was in the same shop.

341
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.369
And it just was an accident.

342
00:17:49.543 --> 00:17:53.286
We started talking
about pantyhose.


343
00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:56.748
She was saying... whatever.
That's not the point of the story.


344
00:17:56.967 --> 00:18:00.880
But what the point is...
was that through this accidental meeting...

345
00:18:01.097 --> 00:18:03.634
It's like, you know,
it's like a hitchcock movie,


346
00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:06.306
Where, you know, you're thrown
into a rubber bag...


347
00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:08.805
And put in the trunk
of a car.


348
00:18:10.439 --> 00:18:13.476
You find people.
You find them.


349
00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:15.854
Something... it...
is it karma?


350
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.064
Maybe.

351
00:18:20.074 --> 00:18:22.235
But we found 'em.
That's the important thing.


352
00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:25.109
And I got Bonnie
a wonderful pantsuit.


353
00:18:25.746 --> 00:18:27.486
They took me off
into a separate room.


354
00:18:27.707 --> 00:18:31.575
I seen 'em takin' different people off,
different ones off in separate rooms.


355
00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:34.327
And put me
on a big, white table.


356
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:39.966
And the guy that take me there...
the one of them that took me...


357
00:18:40.177 --> 00:18:42.042
To examine me, I guess,
he probed me.


358
00:18:42.263 --> 00:18:46.131
And then I was in there, l bet,
more than three or four hours,


359
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.715
In that room being probed.

360
00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:51.602
At one time or another,
different ones of 'em come in.


361
00:18:51.814 --> 00:18:53.679
Four, five, six of 'em
at different times.


362
00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:55.230
And all of 'em probed me.

363
00:18:56.694 --> 00:18:58.901
Not all at once, you know.
Individually.


364
00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:02.317
Later on, years later,
now even still...


365
00:19:03.284 --> 00:19:06.071
It's a funny thing.
It happened on a Sunday.


366
00:19:06.287 --> 00:19:08.073
And every Sunday,
about the time...


367
00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:11.247
That I was taken
on board that... that ship,


368
00:19:12.209 --> 00:19:15.246
Uh, I find I have
no feelings in my buttocks.


369
00:19:16.505 --> 00:19:20.874
Casting a show is really only
the beginning of the process.


370
00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:23.960
There's also
the whole design concept:


371
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.014
What fabrics will work for
the costumes, the lighting.


372
00:19:28.434 --> 00:19:31.267
And it really becomes
a "wrasslin'" match, I guess,


373
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.387
Between me
and the muse of theater...


374
00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:38.395
And, most of all, dance.

375
00:19:55.377 --> 00:19:58.289
I'd like you to close your eyes.
I'd like you to try somethin'.


376
00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:02.252
What are you thinkin'?
What are you feelin' right now with your eyes closed?


377
00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:07.837
I feel a bree... a...
you're blowing in my ear.


378
00:20:08.057 --> 00:20:10.924
- Okay, all right. You jumped to a conclusion.
- Oh. I'm...


379
00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:12.508
See, what I'm
asking for is...


380
00:20:12.728 --> 00:20:16.061
Your first feeling was not
that I was blowing on you.


381
00:20:16.273 --> 00:20:17.388
It was more like...

382
00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:22.185
- "Virgin isles" or "Bahamanian"...
- Ohh.


383
00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:24.107
- Or "Arubian" or...
- Yes.


384
00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:28.032
Yeah, he's at his rehearsal.
He's at his first rehearsal.


385
00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:30.613
I don't know what they're doin',
'cause I never been to one.


386
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.493
But I bet they're introducing
themselves to each other.


387
00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:37.825
You know, it... it's gonna be
nice to meet some of these, um,


388
00:20:38.379 --> 00:20:42.042
New folks, 'cause, uh,
we don't socialize with, uh,


389
00:20:42.258 --> 00:20:43.213
The creative types,
you know.


390
00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:45.632
We got our scrabble club
and stuff,


391
00:20:47.972 --> 00:20:50.839
You know, and other
people with babies.


392
00:20:57.982 --> 00:21:00.564
the exercises
all mean somethin',


393
00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:03.108
Even if
you don't know what.


394
00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:06.525
Dr. Pearl, well,
he'll come around.


395
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.526
And he'll learn,

396
00:21:08.742 --> 00:21:12.826
Like, uh, Ron and Sheila
and I have learned...


397
00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:14.323
That Corky has a vision.

398
00:21:23.507 --> 00:21:24.713
Woo!

399
00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:29.677
- Oh!
- Forget about it!


400
00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:33.847
Forget about it.

401
00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:39.520
With you, it's okay.
But with him! He thought...


402
00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:42.439
I, uh...

403
00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:44.767
I'm walking... On air.

404
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:46.314
You know, I'm...

405
00:21:46.488 --> 00:21:48.604
This is a sensation
which is... forget it.


406
00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:52.111
When I became a dentist,
I thought I was happy. But this is...


407
00:21:52.328 --> 00:21:53.943
This is making me
nervous now.


408
00:21:54.163 --> 00:21:57.621
Because I could have
wasted a lot of years.


409
00:21:58.042 --> 00:22:01.580
I must say, I was very shocked
that Dr. Pearl had been cast.


410
00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:03.539
Then I thought...

411
00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:07.715
We're in a glamor profession, being travel agents.
He isn't in such a glamorous...


412
00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:10.293
You know, one project...
we have to loosen him up.


413
00:22:10.512 --> 00:22:13.970
He's a little tight,
particularly when he's around us, probably.


414
00:22:14.224 --> 00:22:15.589
I don't think
he'll mind jokes.


415
00:22:15.809 --> 00:22:18.972
- You're intimidating because you have so much experience.
- I can't help it.


416
00:22:19.188 --> 00:22:22.851
Ron is going to help everyone act,
'cause I know... Ron gives me...


417
00:22:23.025 --> 00:22:27.815
Well, in all the productions we've been in,
and when we do scene studies at home together,


418
00:22:27.988 --> 00:22:33.028
Ron will have extensive hour,
two-hour sessions of notes for me.


419
00:22:33.202 --> 00:22:36.319
- And it's so helpful...
- It's notes for both of us.


420
00:22:36.497 --> 00:22:38.158
- No, but lately...
- You get most.


421
00:22:38.415 --> 00:22:41.657
He's trying to help me change
my instincts or at least ignore them.

422
00:22:43.712 --> 00:22:47.625
Listen, let me tell you why
I'm here. We're doing a show.


423
00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:50.374
I won't beat around the bush.
We're doing a show that I've written....


424
00:22:50.886 --> 00:22:52.877
About the 150th
anniversary of Blaine.


425
00:22:53.097 --> 00:22:57.136
- And I know you're an old Blainian.
- Yes, yes.


426
00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.515
And you're really right
for one of the parts.


427
00:22:59.728 --> 00:23:02.470
It's the narrator
in the show.


428
00:23:02.898 --> 00:23:06.231
One of the actor parts? Oh, I don't know.
- Yeah.


429
00:23:06.443 --> 00:23:08.354
I've heard...
I think you're being modest.


430
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.903
I've heard you've had some
history in show business.


431
00:23:12.116 --> 00:23:12.901
Well, you know,

432
00:23:13.117 --> 00:23:16.609
I did have a hankerin'
to be an actor...


433
00:23:16.829 --> 00:23:19.571
When I was a young feller when
I got out of the coast guard.

434
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.951
But I went
to taxidermy school instead.


435
00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:25.034
Well, I took a correspondence course.
- Uh-huh.


436
00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:26.994
I'll tell you something,
Mr. Wooley.


437
00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:30.877
What I'm looking for
in my shows are actors...


438
00:23:31.218 --> 00:23:33.630
And people that are
willing to work hard.


439
00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:36.929
Well, I-I am a hard worker,
as you can see.


440
00:23:37.141 --> 00:23:40.178
- Oh, I love all the work you've done.
- Makes sense.


441
00:23:40.394 --> 00:23:45.388
That's a little gun rack made out of deer hooves.
- Oh, yeah.


442
00:23:45.941 --> 00:23:49.308
Boy, I didn't know deers
could do that, you know.


443
00:23:53.407 --> 00:23:54.817
I know this comes
outta left field,


444
00:23:55.034 --> 00:23:56.945
But I'm looking
for another actor.


445
00:23:57.161 --> 00:24:00.904
I was wondering if you had
any interest in participating in the show.

446
00:24:01.665 --> 00:24:03.451
Does that appeal to you
in any way?


447
00:24:03.792 --> 00:24:06.329
I'm not much of an actor. I'm sorry.
- Oh, I...


448
00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:09.708
I never done that... anything like that before, really.
- Uh-huh.


449
00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:13.291
Okay, fair enough. But it might
be interesting, you know.


450
00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:17.378
Well, what... do you get off tonight?
What time do you get off tonight?


451
00:24:17.598 --> 00:24:20.305
- I get off at 8:00.
- At 8:00 tonight?


452
00:24:20.517 --> 00:24:23.554
- Yeah.
- Really? That's a long day.


453
00:24:23.771 --> 00:24:26.353
Yeah. Hey, Dad,
this is Mr...


454
00:24:26.815 --> 00:24:29.022
- St. Clair.
- St. Clair. He's a drama guy.


455
00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:32.522
Yeah. And, um, at 8:00, you're off, though?
- Right.


456
00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:35.313
I have to tell ya,
I'm not much of an actor or singer.


457
00:24:35.532 --> 00:24:38.695
Well, you know, that's
what Charles Laughton said.


458
00:24:38.911 --> 00:24:40.447
And look what happened.

459
00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:44.120
Did you change the fan belt
on that blue Chevy?


460
00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:45.789
No, I haven't
done that yet.


461
00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:49.080
Well, when you get done here, will you get on that?
- Yeah.


462
00:24:50.672 --> 00:24:54.335
- Um, so how tall are you?
- 6'2".


463
00:24:54.551 --> 00:24:55.540
- Really?
- Hmm.


464
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:56.375
Wow.

465
00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:01.672
# It's all the same #

466
00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:04.717
When we say, "Nothing
ever happens in Blaine,"


467
00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:09.647
Could we try
you two singing "Blaine,"


468
00:25:09.817 --> 00:25:12.058
Where we really hear
the "N" at the end.


469
00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:15.986
And you guys just go,
"Nothing ever happens in Blay."


470
00:25:16.198 --> 00:25:17.859
Don't say the "N."
They say the "N's."


471
00:25:18.075 --> 00:25:20.817
"Nothing ever happens.
It's all the same."


472
00:25:21.078 --> 00:25:24.161
And you sing, "It's all the say."
Let's try it once.


473
00:25:24.414 --> 00:25:26.951
Okay, Jeannie, one, two, three and...

474
00:25:27.167 --> 00:25:28.998
I know it's hard
to jump into this,


475
00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:32.870
Because it must seem
like a new world.


476
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.046
But we're gonna
ease you into it.


477
00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:38.877
If you ever have any questions,
you can always call me up.


478
00:25:39.346 --> 00:25:41.712
Give you my... I have a private number.
It's not listed.


479
00:25:41.932 --> 00:25:45.424
So don't lose it, and do not
give it out to anyone.


480
00:25:45.894 --> 00:25:49.227
"How high a ridge,
I could not tell.


481
00:25:49.439 --> 00:25:50.929
- "For the sun...
- Okay, but... yeah, but not...


482
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.641
- The sun has..."
- Yeah, not pinching your shirt.


483
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:56.648
- I want... I want, you see, hook in those thumbs.
- Thumb?


484
00:25:56.864 --> 00:25:58.149
Yeah.
There you go.


485
00:25:59.867 --> 00:26:01.653
Yeah. Just...
that's right.


486
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.617
"How high a ridge,
I could not tell."


487
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.991
See what's happening
with your voice already?


488
00:26:07.207 --> 00:26:09.414
It's almost as if you're
squeezing your boobies out.


489
00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:13.377
- It's gonna be goin' out to that audience.
- Pushing it right out.


490
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:19.717
I could try it out.
"How... how high a ridge I could not tell!"


491
00:26:28.478 --> 00:26:32.346
Keep in time. Okay.

492
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.311
Right. Robin in the nest.

493
00:26:36.069 --> 00:26:38.606
Okay? Right.

494
00:26:39.448 --> 00:26:40.437
Good.

495
00:26:45.078 --> 00:26:49.321
# By the fool in the
stool by the fire of yule #

496
00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:53.079
# It's the rule #

497
00:26:53.253 --> 00:26:57.917
# Stools are where there was once
a time you'd find a chair #

498
00:26:58.133 --> 00:27:03.002
# A chair's for fools
everybody wants stools #


499
00:27:03.222 --> 00:27:04.587
# Stool boom #

500
00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:07.673
# From the parlor
to the poolroom #


501
00:27:07.893 --> 00:27:12.182
# Everyone knows our name #

502
00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:25.691
I don't want to interfere.

503
00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:28.869
But... I think
it would be...


504
00:27:31.792 --> 00:27:33.657
- I think we have to work...
- I can't hear you.


505
00:27:33.877 --> 00:27:37.244
I think we have to work
on the music a little bit more.


506
00:27:37.464 --> 00:27:40.752
Fine.
- But I don't want to make trouble. So...


507
00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:44.133
I don't really want to do this
in front of them.


508
00:27:44.346 --> 00:27:46.803
- But I think...
- Where do you want to do it?


509
00:27:47.057 --> 00:27:50.800
I think we have to sit down
and make a schedule...


510
00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:53.726
That includes
some... some music time.


511
00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:56.305
'Cause I think
Jeanne and I...


512
00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:59.316
- Have to work...
- Why are you whispering?


513
00:27:59.569 --> 00:28:01.059
I'm right here,
you know?


514
00:28:01.697 --> 00:28:04.313
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you
want me to talk louder?


515
00:28:04.533 --> 00:28:08.367
Because l-l think that...

516
00:28:08.537 --> 00:28:10.277
Now it's too loud.

517
00:28:10.497 --> 00:28:13.034
You know, just talk like
a normal person, okay?


518
00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:16.329
I think what they were doing
was good.


519
00:28:17.337 --> 00:28:19.544
- You rehearse. You rehearse. You get it perfect.
- Yes, you rehearse...


520
00:28:19.756 --> 00:28:22.498
You know exactly what you're doing,
and then you forget about it.


521
00:28:23.051 --> 00:28:26.714
You said, they learn it,
they forget it, and that's okay.


522
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.012
- That's great.
- Well, they've forgotten it.


523
00:28:29.224 --> 00:28:33.388
They never learned it. When did they learn it?
When do we have the time...


524
00:28:33.603 --> 00:28:37.016
But if they're gonna forget it anyway,
what difference does it make?


525
00:28:37.232 --> 00:28:40.474
- You see? It's like one of those...
- No, I...


526
00:28:40.694 --> 00:28:42.355
It's like a...
it's a zen thing.


527
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:44.687
It's like, you know,
you know,


528
00:28:44.906 --> 00:28:48.819
"How many babies fit in... in the... in the tire?"
Thing.


529
00:28:49.036 --> 00:28:51.368
- That whole... the old joke, you know.
- Mm-hmm.


530
00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.493
Mm-hmm. No, you have a point.
It's an interesting point.


531
00:28:55.709 --> 00:28:56.994
And how'd you find this place?

532
00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:00.373
Well, we've been, uh,

533
00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:04.123
- Coming here for many years.
- Yeah, we come every Thursday.


534
00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:08.544
- With rehearsals, we won't be able to now.
- This is true.


535
00:29:08.764 --> 00:29:13.258
In China, they'll kill a monkey at the table,
eat the brains right out.


536
00:29:15.896 --> 00:29:18.512
We have friends, Barbara and Bruce,
- Eww.


537
00:29:19.107 --> 00:29:23.316
Who went to China... I'm sure,
you're in the travel business, you've been there.


538
00:29:23.528 --> 00:29:25.439
They went to Peking,
where they make the ducks.


539
00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:30.111
And what they say is that the
food over there is not as good.

540
00:29:30.327 --> 00:29:33.865
You can't get a sauce
as thick and sweet over there.


541
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:35.867
- The food is steamed.
- They didn't have a good time.


542
00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:37.414
They should have
called you.


543
00:29:37.834 --> 00:29:40.200
Yeah, we've got
some good packages.


544
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.038
If you ever want to get to Miami beach,
we got a great package, two weeks...


545
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:46.005
- Oh, really?
- All expense... yeah.


546
00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:49.460
You get everything you need.
Every kind of food in Blaine.


547
00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:55.015
- You know, you got Chinese here, and no need to go.
- We're talking about Miami now.


548
00:29:55.227 --> 00:29:59.095
Yeah, we'd love to go.
- We got a great package, a week, two weeks.


549
00:29:59.314 --> 00:30:02.852
Like there aren't Chinese people in Miami.
- Well, we should.


550
00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:04.558
What does that have to do...
of course.


551
00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:07.273
- "We're talking about China now."
- We're talking about Miami.


552
00:30:07.489 --> 00:30:09.775
"Miami. We're talking
about Miami now."


553
00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:12.198
Put some food on your stomach
before you have more wine.


554
00:30:12.494 --> 00:30:14.200
What's it...
what's it...


555
00:30:14.413 --> 00:30:16.119
Shh. Girl talk.

556
00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:19.622
What's it like to be
with a circumcised man?


557
00:30:20.961 --> 00:30:22.167
That is interesting.

558
00:30:22.379 --> 00:30:26.042
I'd ask more, but Ron said
the whole Jew thing's...


559
00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:28.123
Hmm.

560
00:30:28.969 --> 00:30:30.379
When Ron had his surgery...

561
00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:34.554
- All right. All right.
- I said, "Hey, circumcise it while you're at it."


562
00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:36.973
I had never been
with anyone else.


563
00:30:37.227 --> 00:30:38.967
- I, well...
- Ron's the only man.


564
00:30:39.187 --> 00:30:43.305
What surgery did he have?
A minor corrective surgery.


565
00:30:43.525 --> 00:30:46.483
- Can we have some coffee at this table, please?
- It's not minor anymore.


566
00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:51.730
Well, maybe we should change the subject.
- No. It's...


567
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.657
I had what, you know,
most guys would,


568
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.826
Uh, dream of, you know.

569
00:30:56.997 --> 00:31:00.990
I had to have
a penis reduction surgery.


570
00:31:01.209 --> 00:31:02.949
- I'm sorry?
- Penis reduction.


571
00:31:03.253 --> 00:31:06.916
- There aren't many. You're gonna say, "I never heard of that."
- Penis reduction?


572
00:31:07.174 --> 00:31:08.664
I said, "Ron, do something."

573
00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:12.668
He said, "Why don't you get one
of those vagina enlargements?"


574
00:31:12.888 --> 00:31:14.753
Dear! Can we have
some coffee over here?


575
00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:18.723
Have you tried the egg rolls? Unbelievable.
- Let me ask you something.


576
00:31:18.935 --> 00:31:20.766
- You're a medical man.
- Yes.


577
00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:23.891
I want to ask you something. If you'd...
- Oh!


578
00:31:24.107 --> 00:31:27.144
Oh, for heaven's sake! No, no! No!
- Don't do that.


579
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.275
- Doctor, please...
- Medicine man not go near dances with stumpy. No.


580
00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:33.947
Everybody? Everybody?

581
00:31:34.284 --> 00:31:36.240
I have a little announcement
to make.


582
00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:38.197
I wasn't gonna tell you.

583
00:31:38.413 --> 00:31:43.533
I sent out ten letters to
different producers in New York City.

584
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.668
This is from the Oppenheimer organization.

585
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.961
"Dear Mr. St. Clair:

586
00:31:49.508 --> 00:31:50.839
"In response
to your letter,

593

with his comments."


594
00:32:12.364 --> 00:32:15.856
- How about that?
- "We thank you for the invitation."


595
00:32:16.076 --> 00:32:20.695
And it says, "Best regards,
Samuel Oppenheimer, Jr."


596
00:32:21.248 --> 00:32:24.661
Wow! What does
this mean, Corky?


597
00:32:24.918 --> 00:32:25.907
What it means is,

598
00:32:26.253 --> 00:32:29.165
We may be goin'
to Broadway!


599
00:32:31.424 --> 00:32:35.167
Oh! Oh!
This is great news!


600
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:38.257
How about that?
Did you hear?


601
00:32:38.473 --> 00:32:42.682
My aunt... I brought out
her atlas that I look at a lot...


602
00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:46.011
This big, blue book...
and opened up to "New York."


603
00:32:46.231 --> 00:32:48.187
And it's an island
is really what it is.


604
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.938
It's this island...
Full of people...


605
00:32:52.195 --> 00:32:55.528
Of different colors
and different ideas.


606
00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.356
And I can't... it sounds
like a lot of fun to me.


607
00:32:58.577 --> 00:33:00.738
You know, we don't see
much of that...


608
00:33:01.621 --> 00:33:02.656
In Blaine.

609
00:33:03.409 --> 00:33:07.100
I'd like to maybe
meet some guys and...


610
00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.916
Italian guys or...

611
00:33:09.671 --> 00:33:11.377
You know, I've
watched TV and stuff.


612
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:13.963
I'm gonna be glad to do
the show on Broadway.


613
00:33:14.175 --> 00:33:17.508
And there'll probably be other offers.
Keepin' our fingers crossed.


614
00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:20.554
But I don't know if the theater
and the stage is for me.


615
00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:24.178
For one thing,
there's an awful lot of memorizing of lines.


616
00:33:24.394 --> 00:33:28.228
- And I think you know what I'm thinkin'.
- Yeah. That's in the way.


617
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.226
Hollywood.

618
00:33:30.525 --> 00:33:33.232
Uh, even when I was a kid
doin' my impressions.


619
00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:35.777
"Here's lookin'
at you, babe," and, uh,


620
00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:40.858
"You don't c-care
about anyone but yourself."


621
00:33:41.077 --> 00:33:42.533
Who was it?

622
00:33:42.746 --> 00:33:44.828
Henry Fonda. I always
tell her who I'm doin'.


623
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.905
She always laughs and says,
"Now who is that?"


624
00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:49.366
Back there, there's always
the germ in my mind...


625
00:33:49.586 --> 00:33:52.043
- That I'd end up on the silver screen.
- Mm-hmm.


626
00:33:52.213 --> 00:33:54.420
You've got the face
for it too, darlin'.


627
00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.290
I want to try that
"less is more" kind of acting,


628
00:33:57.677 --> 00:34:00.919
Where when you're talking to someone,
you close your eyes.


629
00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:03.596
And then you look at them
when you're not talking to the person.

630
00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.806
I mean, open your eyes
when you're looking away.


631
00:34:06.019 --> 00:34:08.260
When you talk to the person,
you go like that.


632
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.313
Never open your eyes
when talking to them.


633
00:34:11.524 --> 00:34:13.014
The Guffman news
is really big.


634
00:34:16.571 --> 00:34:19.404
That the cast
understand how big.


635
00:34:19.574 --> 00:34:21.280
They don't know
the New York thing.


636
00:34:21.493 --> 00:34:23.529
They haven't been
through it, and I have.


637
00:34:23.745 --> 00:34:25.906
So it is kind of
on my shoulders.


638
00:34:26.122 --> 00:34:30.536
And going to the big apple
for the first time,


639
00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:34.290
You know, is such an experience,
you never forget it.


640
00:34:34.506 --> 00:34:36.212
It stays with you
for your whole life.


641
00:34:36.466 --> 00:34:40.129
Me, you know, right out of the navy,
you know, fresh off a destroyer,


642
00:34:40.345 --> 00:34:44.258
Uh, with a dance belt and
a tube of chap stick, basically.


643
00:34:44.474 --> 00:34:46.430
Not really much
to call my own.


644
00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:49.347
And then basically
being slammed down...


645
00:34:49.562 --> 00:34:51.769
For ten or so years.

646
00:34:51.981 --> 00:34:54.188
You know,
off-off-off-off-broadway.


647
00:34:54.401 --> 00:34:56.892
And then enough is enough,
okay? I get the joke.


648
00:34:57.237 --> 00:35:00.195
And is that gonna happen again?
I don't know.


649
00:35:00.615 --> 00:35:01.855
I don't want it
to happen again.


650
00:35:02.075 --> 00:35:06.318
In my deepest, deepest of hearts,
I do not want it to happen again.


651
00:35:06.538 --> 00:35:09.575
Mr. Guffman brings
with him... A reputation,


652
00:35:09.833 --> 00:35:13.371
Something bigger than anyone
in this town has ever known.


653
00:35:13.545 --> 00:35:18.005
And if I am to get back
to New York City on my terms,


654
00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:21.253
I cannot deliver him...
A stinky product.


655
00:35:21.511 --> 00:35:25.220
I really have to be
presenting him...


656
00:35:25.432 --> 00:35:27.844
A package,
a beautifully wrapped,


657
00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:31.426
Glossy,
sweet-smelling show.


658
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.517
What I need from you,

659
00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:37.850
Because you're the bosses
of the town, essentially...


660
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.355
And I know that... is...

661
00:35:41.448 --> 00:35:42.437
This is so hard.

662
00:35:42.657 --> 00:35:44.773
I mean, there's nothing
easy about this.


663
00:35:44.993 --> 00:35:49.578
This is like when you're gettin' your legs waxed,
and they whip that thing off real fast.


664
00:35:49.789 --> 00:35:51.905
That's what this is like.

665
00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:55.208
I need more money.

666
00:35:55.378 --> 00:35:57.369
How much do you need?

667
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:59.295
- How much?
- Steve's right. How much are you thinkin'?


668
00:35:59.549 --> 00:36:01.460
Okay.

669
00:36:02.677 --> 00:36:03.962
What I need...

670
00:36:05.889 --> 00:36:07.800
Is $100,000.

671
00:36:15.315 --> 00:36:16.725
- Oh, brother!
- Corky!


672
00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:19.353
You know, he is good.

673
00:36:19.903 --> 00:36:22.610
Let me explain.
Let me explain what...


674
00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:26.815
Oh, man, my heart stopped
for a second there.


675
00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:30.201
All right,
let me explain what that entails.


676
00:36:30.413 --> 00:36:32.199
I bought it all the way,
by the way.


677
00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:37.330
- He's serious.
- He's not kiddin'.


678
00:36:37.587 --> 00:36:39.919
Corky, our entire budget
for the entire year...


679
00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:44.090
Is $15,000 for everything,
and that includes swimming.


680
00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:47.927
I don't have swimmin' in my show.
- No, I mean the pool.


681
00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:50.630
We have to keep up the pool.
That's everything. The entire year is $15,000.


682
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.262
- We have a manager...
- $100,000?


683
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.636
Look, you're a nice fellow.
We're glad you're here.


684
00:36:55.855 --> 00:37:00.474
But if I may be blunt,
what's wrong with you?


685
00:37:03.029 --> 00:37:06.521
So what I'm understanding here,
and correct me if I'm wrong,


686
00:37:06.741 --> 00:37:10.154
Is that you're not givin' me
any money.


687
00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:12.614
So now I'm left
basically with nothin'.


688
00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:17.040
I'm left with zero. And which,
and which, what can I do with zero?


689
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.451
You know, what can I...
I can't do anythin' with it.


690
00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:21.832
I need... this is my
life here we're talkin' about.

691
00:37:22.048 --> 00:37:24.915
We're not talkin' about, you know,
somethin' else. We're talkin' about my life.


692
00:37:25.218 --> 00:37:28.085
You know?
And it's forcing me to do something I don't wanna do.


693
00:37:28.805 --> 00:37:31.717
To leave.
T-to go out and just leave...


694
00:37:31.933 --> 00:37:34.925
And go home and, say,
make a clean cut here.


695
00:37:35.144 --> 00:37:38.511
And say, "No way, Corky.
You're not puttin' up with these people."


696
00:37:38.731 --> 00:37:41.393
And I'll tell you why
I can't put up with you people.


697
00:37:41.609 --> 00:37:43.440
Because you're bastard people.

698
00:37:43.903 --> 00:37:45.814
That's what you are.
You're just bastard people.


699
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:50.774
And I'm goin' home,
and I'm gonna bite my pillow is what I'm gonna do.


700
00:37:57.625 --> 00:37:59.661
Now what do you use on your skin?
- Vaseline.


701
00:37:59.878 --> 00:38:01.869
- You use petroleum jelly on your skin?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.


702
00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:04.037
- You are getting away with murder, Libby.
- What do you mean?


703
00:38:04.257 --> 00:38:05.793
You're young, and it's okay, but...
- Libby.


704
00:38:06.009 --> 00:38:07.374
Have I told you about... hi.
- Libby, I have an announcement.


705
00:38:07.594 --> 00:38:09.550
- I have to talk to you. I'm gonna have to talk to you.
- Have I told you about...


706
00:38:09.762 --> 00:38:11.969
- Excuse me, Libby, I have to talk to you.
- All right.


707
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:14.593
- I'm gonna round this up.
- Okay. Hold on. Hold on.


708
00:38:14.809 --> 00:38:16.515
- Dr. Pearl. Good morning.
- Good morning.


709
00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:20.346
- We have an announcement. We have to talk, okay?
- All right.


710
00:38:21.608 --> 00:38:24.145
Gather around, please.
Gather around.


711
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.318
Libby, Sheila,
excuse me. Ron.


712
00:38:27.488 --> 00:38:29.604
Thank you. Dr. Pearl.
Please, be quiet.


713
00:38:29.824 --> 00:38:31.860
I have an announcement.
We've gotta listen up here.


714
00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:34.192
- Excuse me. Are we gonna be vocalizing?
- Okay, listen up.


715
00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:36.573
- We will be vocalizing.
- Before we start, I'd like to clear my throat.


716
00:38:36.789 --> 00:38:38.325
Good.

717
00:38:38.541 --> 00:38:43.456
Yes, we'll be vocalizing.
We'll be doing a lot of... excuse me, please!


718
00:38:44.005 --> 00:38:47.168
Everybody, let's be serious now
just for a moment.


719
00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.006
And let's all listen up,
okay?


720
00:38:49.177 --> 00:38:52.260
Corky has left the show,
and I am taking over.


721
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:58.597
What I want to do today is start with some music,
do dancing and work on our lines.


722
00:38:58.853 --> 00:39:01.185
And my hope is
at the end of five days,


723
00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:03.646
- What do you mean?
- We will know what we're doing, and we will have a show.


724
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.892
- Corky's left?
- You mean, he's left for today or permanently?


725
00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:09.272
Corky's quit the show,
and it's my show.


726
00:39:10.698 --> 00:39:12.939
Corky!
- Cork!


727
00:39:14.661 --> 00:39:15.946
Corky!

728
00:39:19.165 --> 00:39:22.874
- Here, you go up.
- Boy, do that twice a day. That's good exercise.


729
00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:25.118
- Corky!
- Most athletic injuries... is he not answering?


730
00:39:25.338 --> 00:39:28.125
Corky, we love you!
- Corky, open up!


731
00:39:28.341 --> 00:39:30.923
Corky, we love you.
We want you to live.


732
00:39:31.678 --> 00:39:34.294
- There may be something wrong. Try the door again.
- Oh, God. It's us.


733
00:39:45.942 --> 00:39:48.558
- He wants to be alone right now.
- I can't forgive myself if something was wrong.


734
00:39:48.778 --> 00:39:52.145
Just shut up! Just shut up!
Jesus Christ!


735
00:39:53.074 --> 00:39:57.283
Crazy people, my God!

736
00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.951
I know how he feels too.

737
00:40:00.707 --> 00:40:03.744
I guess I can just go back
to the Dairy Queen, you know.


738
00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:09.420
They said they'd take me back.

739
00:40:13.302 --> 00:40:15.588
I always have a place
at the Dairy Queen.


740
00:40:21.019 --> 00:40:21.929
You gotta stop cryin'.

741
00:40:22.145 --> 00:40:25.478
She hasn't cried this much since
the day we got married, honestly.

742
00:40:25.982 --> 00:40:28.314
You know,
this is wonderful.


743
00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:32.690
Why didn't I react like this when I was
playing football for the Blaine panthers...


744
00:40:32.905 --> 00:40:34.896
And our quarterback went down
with a dislocated knee.


745
00:40:35.158 --> 00:40:37.774
- I should've said, "time-out."
- 'Cause you're strong, Ron. You're strong.


746
00:40:37.994 --> 00:40:39.859
- You're just a big brick.
- Oh, let's delay the game.


747
00:40:40.121 --> 00:40:43.113
And my lip would tremble,
and I'd say we have an injured quarterback.


748
00:40:43.332 --> 00:40:45.368
Let's give up. No!
You know what we did?


749
00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:47.416
We brought in
the second-string quarterback.


750
00:40:47.587 --> 00:40:49.498
When he went down, we brought in
the third-string quarterback.


751
00:40:49.756 --> 00:40:52.463
And we went on,
and we whipped the pants off of Harry Truman high school.


752
00:40:52.633 --> 00:40:56.797
And next week,
went out and mopped the floor with blessed heart of Mary.


753
00:40:57.013 --> 00:40:59.470
And they went on to win
the state championship.


754
00:41:05.188 --> 00:41:08.726
To tell you the truth,
I haven't even thought about it, not for a...


755
00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:12.479
Not for a second have I dwelled
on the fact that the show's over.

756
00:41:12.695 --> 00:41:17.359
I don't, uh, I don't, uh, think about it.
I try not to think about it.


757
00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:18.985
And therefore,
I, you know, don't,


758
00:41:19.202 --> 00:41:23.491
Because it's a very healthy way
to deal with something that is very...

759
00:41:23.706 --> 00:41:25.788
Ultimately, not that important
in the long run.


760
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.992
It's not, not, uh,
not important at all,


761
00:41:29.337 --> 00:41:30.873
You know, for me.

762
00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:36.424
I'm just so sad for Corky,
you know.


763
00:41:36.636 --> 00:41:40.424
I mean, I think these creative people,
they're real emotional.


764
00:41:40.973 --> 00:41:44.682
And, um,
I think the important thing about show biz people is...


765
00:41:44.894 --> 00:41:46.555
That you gotta have
another life.


766
00:41:46.771 --> 00:41:50.013
And I know, you know, uh,
he-he-he's got a wife.


767
00:41:50.233 --> 00:41:55.148
I guess she's out of town, uh,
because I haven't seen her ln...


768
00:41:55.363 --> 00:41:59.402
I've never seen her, so, you know,
that could be the problem.


769
00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:01.858
You know, maybe she's just
not supportive.


770
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.236
Corky, without you,
there's no show.


771
00:42:04.413 --> 00:42:06.324
Without the show,
there's no celebration.


772
00:42:06.582 --> 00:42:08.743
Without celebration,
there's no Blaine.


773
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.121
So, you see how
it's a domino effect.


774
00:42:11.838 --> 00:42:13.544
You know how
dominoes do that.


775
00:42:13.756 --> 00:42:16.372
Without Blaine, I got news for you,
there's no Missouri.


776
00:42:16.592 --> 00:42:17.752
Blaine is the heart
of Missouri.


777
00:42:18.344 --> 00:42:21.177
What happens if Missouri goes down?
You tell me.


778
00:42:21.389 --> 00:42:25.052
We need the magic back in
the show is what we need.

779
00:42:25.268 --> 00:42:27.429
And it ain't gonna happen
with Lloyd.


780
00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:32.605
Lloyd is a music teacher, and he shops at Wal-Mart.
He doesn't even support the town.


781
00:42:32.942 --> 00:42:37.982
But the person who needs you most is Blaine Fabin.
- Hear, hear.


782
00:42:38.239 --> 00:42:42.448
- And I'm not just saying that because I am a Fabin.
- Okay, okay.


783
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.651
I'm saying that
because I just know...


784
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:48.034
That nobody
can touch, um,


785
00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:51.206
That whole...
Thing.


786
00:42:52.378 --> 00:42:53.959
That whole thing.
Hmm?


787
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:57.877
You could take a nickel,
and you could make it into a million dollars,


788
00:42:58.092 --> 00:43:00.333
Because this man is a genius,
and we cannot lose that.


789
00:43:00.553 --> 00:43:02.714
Look what you did with Barefoot
when you came to this town.

790
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.387
Did you have any budget then? You didn't have $100,000 then.
- Barefoot was a perfect show.


791
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.340
- And look what happened to that show.
- Great show.


792
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.428
And what about Backdraft? You took a little cellophane,
and you made it into flames.


793
00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:15.022
- You could still feel the heat.
- You know what? You're not wrong.


794
00:43:15.484 --> 00:43:19.227
We need you to take
your magic wand and wave it.

795
00:43:20.323 --> 00:43:22.985
And make this town special
again is what we need.

796
00:43:24.911 --> 00:43:25.900
Will you do it?

797
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.032
Please. Please.
- Come on back, cork.


798
00:43:43.846 --> 00:43:48.055
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.


799
00:43:48.267 --> 00:43:49.848
Please. Oh!

800
00:43:51.187 --> 00:43:53.769
All right. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.


801
00:43:55.066 --> 00:43:56.351
Thank you.
Okay.


802
00:43:57.109 --> 00:44:00.226
Let's pretend that it
never happened, okay?


803
00:44:00.821 --> 00:44:02.607
And let's just jump into
"Covered wagons."


804
00:44:02.865 --> 00:44:06.028
- All right, let's start from the dance part, all right?
- "Covered wagons."


805
00:44:15.544 --> 00:44:20.413
in a funny way,
what the city council did was really give me a challenge.


806
00:44:20.716 --> 00:44:24.334
And it's a challenge
that I am going to accept.


807
00:44:24.553 --> 00:44:27.636
It's like in the olden days,
in the days in France,


808
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.597
When men would slap each other
with their gloves,


809
00:44:31.143 --> 00:44:34.260
And say, you know,
"D'Artagnan," you know,


810
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.345
"How dare you talk to me
like that, you?"


811
00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.264
And smack him.

812
00:44:38.484 --> 00:44:40.816
# Stool boom #

813
00:44:41.028 --> 00:44:42.939
# From the parlor
to the poolroom #


814
00:44:43.906 --> 00:44:46.568
# We're in the center
of the stool boom #


815
00:44:47.326 --> 00:44:51.035
# Everybody knows our name #

816
00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.945
# Working, building #

817
00:44:53.207 --> 00:44:54.663
# Never stopping
never sleeping #


818
00:44:54.917 --> 00:44:57.875
# Working, making
some for selling some for keeping #


819
00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:06.459
# It's the rule
everyone has a stool #


820
00:45:06.887 --> 00:45:08.218
# Just three legs #

821
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:13.303
# It's a treat for which
a monarch begs hawk your jewels #


822
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:15.597
I did wanna mention one thing.
- Mm-hmm.


823
00:45:18.399 --> 00:45:19.354
Specs?

824
00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.186
1845, You know,
I think,


825
00:45:22.445 --> 00:45:26.154
it's a little problem.
- Oh! Oh-oh, oh-oh.


826
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.315
- My glasses?
- Yeah.


827
00:45:29.535 --> 00:45:31.617
You're saying, l ca...
- I don't think you should wear them.


828
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:35.071
Don't wear them in the show?
- It's mostly in "Covered wagons."


829
00:45:35.291 --> 00:45:39.580
Because I think that that's the
one where it's just not as believable.

830
00:45:39.795 --> 00:45:42.787
Of course,
when you get further up in time,


831
00:45:43.007 --> 00:45:46.044
- Historically, it's...
- I-I can see a couple of problems,


832
00:45:46.302 --> 00:45:48.258
Nothing major,
and nothing that we can't solve.


833
00:45:48.471 --> 00:45:53.340
Uh, one, uh,
contrary to public opinion,


834
00:45:53.601 --> 00:45:57.185
I don't see very well,
uh, without my glasses.


835
00:45:57.396 --> 00:46:00.888
So, you know, I'm thinking,
is that going to be a problem for me?


836
00:46:01.108 --> 00:46:02.894
Just... Look out.

837
00:46:03.444 --> 00:46:07.813
And the other thing, which,
uh, is also a problem, is...


838
00:46:08.407 --> 00:46:11.490
I have a very lazy eye,

839
00:46:17.583 --> 00:46:20.916
three, four, five, six,
seven and...


840
00:46:21.128 --> 00:46:24.712
# Blue sky,
blue sea #


841
00:46:25.091 --> 00:46:28.925
# Blue grass,
blue tree #


842
00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:33.341
# There's a fire in our hearts
that makes this country strong #


843
00:46:33.849 --> 00:46:37.808
# There's a fire in our hearts
that helps us sing this song #


844
00:46:38.145 --> 00:46:40.807
getting off the horse is not a problem.
I can get off like that.


845
00:46:41.023 --> 00:46:42.979
But the, uh...
where I'm having a problem is...


846
00:46:43.192 --> 00:46:46.229
Sometimes the horse comes out,
and I can't get past the cow.


847
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.027
So, I have to, kinda, you know,
do this when I come out,


848
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.322
"Gather 'round
for I have news."


849
00:46:51.534 --> 00:46:54.367
I don't know which is more lifelike,
the horse or Dr. Pearl.


850
00:46:57.331 --> 00:46:57.945
You.

851
00:46:58.165 --> 00:47:00.702
Corky, here's the phone.

852
00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:01.953
It's Johnny.

853
00:47:03.712 --> 00:47:06.920
Hello. Yeah.

854
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:10.374
What do you mean?

855
00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.334
- Then we back up.
- So wait 'til we turn around to you.


856
00:47:13.722 --> 00:47:16.338
What do you mean? What do you mean?
What are you saying?


857
00:47:18.144 --> 00:47:21.978
I understand that. No, I understand.
Believe me, I do understand.


858
00:47:23.023 --> 00:47:26.607
What you can do is just say,
"Absolutely not."


859
00:47:26.819 --> 00:47:28.355
Do you understand that?

860
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:30.902
I-I don't believe that.
No, I'm sorry.


861
00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:34.278
I do not accept that.
That is not an answer. No.


862
00:47:34.702 --> 00:47:38.820
It's absolutely unacceptable that you would say this now.
Not today.


863
00:47:39.123 --> 00:47:39.908
No!

864
00:47:42.334 --> 00:47:44.165
And that's the...
that's the way it is?


865
00:47:44.503 --> 00:47:48.087
Then I just hate you,
and I hate your "ass face."


866
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.457
Oh, Corky.

867
00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:53.550
- What's up?
- Johnny's not in the show.


868
00:47:53.762 --> 00:47:56.754
His dad said he has to go back to work.
He's not in the show.


869
00:47:57.558 --> 00:47:58.718
What does he
think this is, school?


870
00:47:58.934 --> 00:48:00.799
That he can be
marked absent one day?


871
00:48:01.312 --> 00:48:04.145
This is the day of the show, y'all.
- Oh, my God.


872
00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:06.973
- Just, just...
- This is very strange.


873
00:48:07.193 --> 00:48:10.185
Ron, j-j-just let me think
for a second, all right?


874
00:48:10.404 --> 00:48:12.645
I've just got to take
a breath here...


875
00:48:12.865 --> 00:48:14.856
And try to figure this out,
all right?


876
00:48:20.956 --> 00:48:22.912
- It's tight. That hurts.
- Oh, I'm sorry.


877
00:48:23.125 --> 00:48:25.867
Okay, you know what? If you could hike it up a bit,
you'd get a little more room.


878
00:48:26.086 --> 00:48:27.371
Yeah, well, I am
pulling them up.


879
00:48:27.588 --> 00:48:30.830
I'm sort of trying to commit to one side here, dear.
- This is Johnny's costume.


880
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:35.635
And Johnny is a lot... you know,
he's a different body type than you are.


881
00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:38.087
This is... I'm worried because this won't...

882
00:48:38.307 --> 00:48:40.514
- I'm about five inches away...
- I understand.


883
00:48:40.726 --> 00:48:43.763
Actors, we're at fifteen minutes.

884
00:48:43.979 --> 00:48:45.094
We're at fifteen.

885
00:48:45.314 --> 00:48:49.523
No, no, no, we gotta move now. Come on.
Come on. You're gonna have to help me here.


886
00:48:49.735 --> 00:48:51.851
- You gotta help me here.
- Wait. Okay.


887
00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:03.946
- I'm so nervous tonight, ron.
- You're gonna be great. You're gonna be great.


888
00:49:04.166 --> 00:49:06.373
- And if there's an empty space, just say a line.
- Yeah.


889
00:49:06.585 --> 00:49:08.826
That's what I like to do,
even if it's from another show.


890
00:49:16.136 --> 00:49:17.626
Agnes, where's
the lilac dress?


891
00:49:17.846 --> 00:49:19.336
- You mean, the purple one?
- Yes, where is it?


892
00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:23.141
Honey, I told you to lay off the hot fudge sundaes.
I couldn't let the seams out.


893
00:49:23.352 --> 00:49:26.435
- What? It's not here? Agnes.
- No, it is not. Hello, sweetheart.


894
00:49:40.035 --> 00:49:44.620
- Oh, I just dried my makeup.
- Hark, a rider approaches.


895
00:49:44.832 --> 00:49:47.744
Oh, god!
- That's all right. Just... careful.


896
00:49:48.168 --> 00:49:51.456
- I hope that isn't too hot.
- No, no, it's just fine.


897
00:50:33.172 --> 00:50:35.663
May I remind you, please?
No glasses for the first number, all right?


898
00:50:35.883 --> 00:50:37.544
Oh, no. No, no.
I didn't forget.


899
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.716
Actors, we're at places.

900
00:50:40.387 --> 00:50:42.378
Have a good show, everybody.
Break a leg.


901
00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:20.841
- Don't worry about anything 'cause it's gonna all roll...
- He's not here.


902
00:51:21.053 --> 00:51:22.543
- What?
- He's not here.


903
00:51:22.763 --> 00:51:24.378
Guffman?
- Not here?


904
00:51:24.598 --> 00:51:26.134
Okay, okay, look.
- Should we lower the curtain?


905
00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.432
Corky?
- No, no, no. Everybody, look, look, look.


906
00:51:28.644 --> 00:51:31.260
I've been through this
a million times.


907
00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.471
These New York types
like to come late.


908
00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:38.105
Believe me,
I've never seen one of them come on time in all my years in the theater.


909
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.605
- Take a deep breath.
- Good.


910
00:51:40.239 --> 00:51:42.070
Blow it out.
He's gonna be here.


911
00:51:42.282 --> 00:51:45.945
Let's just do a good show.
Everybody do a good show.


912
00:51:46.161 --> 00:51:47.025
Hands in the middle.

913
00:52:22.448 --> 00:52:24.063
Oh, howdy!

914
00:52:25.367 --> 00:52:29.076
I didn't see you
sneak up on me there.


915
00:52:29.663 --> 00:52:33.622
But if you'd like,
you're welcome to share my campfire with me.


916
00:52:33.834 --> 00:52:36.246
I was just fixin'
to get me some grub.


917
00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:38.369
Beans.

918
00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.625
I love beans.

919
00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:44.504
Big, fat, hot, juicy beans.

920
00:52:44.887 --> 00:52:47.253
Now don't get me goin'
on beans,


921
00:52:47.514 --> 00:52:50.551
Or I'll be jabberin' away
'til the sun comes up.


922
00:52:51.393 --> 00:52:54.180
But, you know,
now that I've got your ear,


923
00:52:54.396 --> 00:52:57.058
There is a story I wouldn't mind
sharin' with ya.


924
00:52:57.649 --> 00:53:02.188
It's a tall tale that
grows taller with each passing year.

925
00:53:02.404 --> 00:53:05.396
It's the story of Blaine.

926
00:53:20.756 --> 00:53:22.496
Well, we've traveled
long and far today.


927
00:53:22.716 --> 00:53:24.331
We must let the women
and children rest.


928
00:53:24.551 --> 00:53:27.384
Don't you rest on our account,
Daniel Potter.


929
00:53:27.596 --> 00:53:32.135
We women are just as strong
and resilient as you men.


930
00:53:32.351 --> 00:53:35.343
I do believe ya are, Rebecca.
I do believe ya are.


931
00:53:35.604 --> 00:53:38.971
California will be a sight
for these weary eyes.


932
00:53:39.191 --> 00:53:41.352
Mine as well, Rebecca,
mine as well.


933
00:53:41.568 --> 00:53:44.025
But right now,
we need a campfire to warm our souls...


934
00:53:44.238 --> 00:53:46.695
- And to cook our food.
- Done.


935
00:53:53.121 --> 00:53:57.160
- That will be quite enough of that, Billy Whitaker.
- Just one kiss.


936
00:53:57.376 --> 00:54:00.868
There will be plenty of time
for kissin' when we get to California.

937
00:54:01.588 --> 00:54:03.544
If we get
to California.


938
00:54:03.757 --> 00:54:05.167
Oh, we'll get there.

939
00:54:05.759 --> 00:54:08.296
Blaine Fabin
will lead us there.


940
00:54:08.554 --> 00:54:10.636
Hark, a rider approaches.

941
00:54:10.848 --> 00:54:12.634
Blaine Fabin
returns.


942
00:54:13.642 --> 00:54:17.726
Whoa! Hello there.

943
00:54:18.146 --> 00:54:20.432
Whoa! Steady.

944
00:54:22.276 --> 00:54:24.483
Gather 'round,
for I have news.


945
00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:28.858
What news?
What did your keen and perceptive eyes behold?


946
00:54:30.742 --> 00:54:33.154
Just up yonder,
there is a ridge.


947
00:54:33.745 --> 00:54:35.986
And how high a ridge,
I could not tell.


948
00:54:36.415 --> 00:54:40.749
For the sun had set and
darkness fell before I reached its pinnacle.

949
00:54:41.253 --> 00:54:44.336
Then a strange thing
happened.


950
00:54:45.132 --> 00:54:47.544
My nose
started twitchin'.


951
00:54:47.926 --> 00:54:51.168
There is a mysterious scent
in the night air.


952
00:54:51.597 --> 00:54:55.215
- What kind of scent?
- What was this mysterious scent?


953
00:54:55.434 --> 00:54:59.143
It was the scent
of saltwater.


954
00:54:59.354 --> 00:55:02.061
- Saltwater?
- Hub-hub, hub-hub, hub-hub.


955
00:55:02.357 --> 00:55:06.066
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have reached our destination.


956
00:55:06.278 --> 00:55:07.939
We have reached
the pacific.


957
00:55:08.572 --> 00:55:13.191
Welcome to California!

958
00:55:18.332 --> 00:55:20.618
# Grab your feller
by the hand #


959
00:55:20.834 --> 00:55:23.246
# Welcome him
to the promised land #


960
00:55:23.462 --> 00:55:25.703
# Grab your lady
by the arm #


961
00:55:25.964 --> 00:55:28.626
# Take her out
behind the barn #


962
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.505
# Everybody dance #

963
00:56:25.107 --> 00:56:26.142
That was great.

964
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:34.234
Sixty years went by and the town of
Blaine kept a-growin' and a-changin'.


965
00:56:34.658 --> 00:56:39.072
Every time you looked around,
a new house was goin' up, a new family was movin' in.


966
00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:42.988
- Oh, hurry, Agnes.
- Oh, I am trying to hurry. There we go.


967
00:56:43.208 --> 00:56:47.292
You got my hat?
- Your hat? Right here's your hat, darling.


968
00:56:47.671 --> 00:56:51.380
McGillicutty's orchard became
the Blaine elementary school.


969
00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:56.635
They even laid track for that newfangled invention,
the iron horse,


970
00:56:56.847 --> 00:56:59.964
Which brought a pretty important visitor to Blaine.

971
00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:04.472
Yea!
It's president McKinley.


972
00:57:07.274 --> 00:57:11.608
Good people of Blaine,
they told me my next stop was Wichita.


973
00:57:11.903 --> 00:57:14.064
But I said,
"What about Blaine?"


974
00:57:14.281 --> 00:57:16.567
Hurrah! Hurrah!

975
00:57:16.783 --> 00:57:18.944
I guess I need
a new travel agent.


976
00:57:21.872 --> 00:57:25.615
Mr. President,
in honor of our visit...


977
00:57:25.834 --> 00:57:28.826
Your visit...
to our town,


978
00:57:29.046 --> 00:57:33.915
I present you humbly with
this fair key to our city.

979
00:57:34.134 --> 00:57:38.844
Well, I do declare,
I believe the key to the city is larger than the city itself.


980
00:57:40.766 --> 00:57:42.006
Wait, Mr. President.

981
00:57:42.267 --> 00:57:46.636
- Well, what have we here?
- It's a footstool. I make them.


982
00:57:47.147 --> 00:57:48.432
Well, isn't that interesting?

983
00:57:48.857 --> 00:57:50.472
I'll take this back
to Washington with me.


984
00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:55.064
And every time I rest my feet,
I'll think of Blaine.


985
00:58:01.036 --> 00:58:05.279
Now we all know that politicians
aren't used to keepin' their word.

986
00:58:05.707 --> 00:58:07.117
He's here.
- Who's here?


987
00:58:07.334 --> 00:58:08.824
- He's here.
- He's here. I told you.


988
00:58:09.669 --> 00:58:13.082
Should we start over again?
Let's do "Covered wagons" again.


989
00:58:13.298 --> 00:58:14.538
Well, before you know it,

990
00:58:14.758 --> 00:58:19.843
Everyone, rich and poor alike,
had to have a Blaine stool in their home.


991
00:58:20.222 --> 00:58:22.304
The little town
never knew what hit it.


992
00:58:22.516 --> 00:58:27.135
Footstool factories sprouted up like, uh,
like toadstools.


993
00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:31.893
Everyone had a good job.
Everyone was makin' a good wage.


994
00:58:32.234 --> 00:58:34.976
Blaine was on the map.

995
00:58:47.707 --> 00:58:51.996
# By the pool in the
school by the fires of yule #

996
00:58:52.504 --> 00:58:56.588
# It's the rule there's
a stool there's a stool #

997
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.416
# Stools are where
once upon a time #


998
00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:03.003
# You'd find a chair
a chair's for fools #


999
00:59:03.223 --> 00:59:05.885
# Everybody wants stools #

1000
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:10.811
# Stool boom
from the parlor to the poolroom #


1001
00:59:11.398 --> 00:59:14.356
# We're in the center
of the stool boom #


1002
00:59:14.568 --> 00:59:18.686
# Everyone knows our name #

1003
00:59:18.905 --> 00:59:22.113
# Working, building
never stopping never sleeping #


1004
00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:25.192
# Working, making
some for selling some for keeping #


1005
00:59:25.412 --> 00:59:30.031
# You will drool
at the splendor of these magic stools #


1006
00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:31.660
# It's the rule #

1007
00:59:32.085 --> 00:59:33.996
# Everyone has a stool #

1008
00:59:34.212 --> 00:59:38.706
# Just three legs
it's the treat for which a monarch begs #


1009
00:59:38.925 --> 00:59:43.419
# Hawk your jewels
use the money for stools #


1010
00:59:43.763 --> 00:59:48.848
# Stool boom just three legs
and watch the sales zoom #


1011
00:59:49.019 --> 00:59:52.056
# Like a fever
it's a stool boom #


1012
00:59:52.272 --> 00:59:56.390
# And it's spreading out
from Blaine #


1013
00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:59.522
# Working,
building never stopping never sleeping #


1014
00:59:59.738 --> 01:00:02.775
# Working, making
some for selling some for keeping #


1015
01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:06.825
# Working, building
never stopping never sleeping #


1016
01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:08.743
# Working, making #

1017
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:14.450
# Some for selling
some for keeping #


1018
01:00:15.253 --> 01:00:17.244
Phew!

1019
01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:43.986
I can't wait
to see the second half.


1020
01:00:44.366 --> 01:00:48.075
Allan, his dramatic work.
I mean, I knew he was funny.


1021
01:00:48.286 --> 01:00:52.700
And I knew he could, you know, move, dance,
'cause he's, he's that way.


1022
01:00:52.874 --> 01:00:58.039
But I think his dramatical work
is so moving that, uh, well.


1023
01:00:58.296 --> 01:00:59.627
I mean, I called Joyce,
and I said,


1024
01:00:59.798 --> 01:01:03.882
"Joyce, bring Joshy,
'cause I gotta feed him halftime because I'm just busting."


1025
01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:05.755
This is good.
Boy, they're movin'.


1026
01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:08.136
They're dancin' all over the place.
And the songs are very catchy.


1027
01:01:08.848 --> 01:01:11.965
Uh, very catchy.
I can't get a few of 'em out of my head.


1028
01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:17.270
It's almost to annoying point,
but I think it's good when a song is catchy...


1029
01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.937
From the little experience
I have in show business.


1030
01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:24.816
You know, I knew that Corky could act,
and he could direct, and he could produce.


1031
01:01:24.823 --> 01:01:27.485
But who knew that he was
gonna act and sing and dance?

1032
01:01:27.701 --> 01:01:29.987
You know, he can just do
everything there is to do.


1033
01:01:30.203 --> 01:01:32.694
And there's only one other person
in the world that can do that,

1034
01:01:32.998 --> 01:01:34.329
And that's Barbra Streisand.

1035
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:40.536
He is, uh... I don't know...
an inspiration to this town.


1036
01:01:40.755 --> 01:01:41.790
That's what he is.

1037
01:01:42.716 --> 01:01:47.050
And I for one am very glad to see that
Johnny Savage dropped out of the show.


1038
01:01:47.262 --> 01:01:49.799
Because a couple of years ago
he came in the drugstore,


1039
01:01:50.015 --> 01:01:51.425
And he tried to steal
my stamp machine.


1040
01:01:51.683 --> 01:01:53.514
And that kid is no good.

1041
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:56.055
You could tell just by
his parents he's no good.

1042
01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:58.304
And he would not have added
anything to the show.


1043
01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:01.306
Where Corky, on the other hand...
look at him. Did you see...


1044
01:02:01.901 --> 01:02:03.437
God, I wish I was
in the show!


1045
01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:28.508
I hear that French girls
are very pretty,


1046
01:02:29.262 --> 01:02:31.253
That they wear
the finest of clothes.


1047
01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:35.849
I also hear that they are
experts in the ways of love.

1048
01:02:36.936 --> 01:02:40.099
Ima, I'm going to fight
for my country.


1049
01:02:40.315 --> 01:02:42.727
To fight,
and yes, perhaps, die,


1050
01:02:43.022 --> 01:02:46.525
so that young men
from here to Timbuktu


1051
01:02:46.631 --> 01:02:50.067
can feel the wind of freedom
blowing through their hair.


1052
01:02:50.575 --> 01:02:53.317
Oh, Monty, I didn't mean
to doubt you.


1053
01:02:54.621 --> 01:02:58.910
It's just sometimes I feel
as if I don't really know you.


1054
01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.497
I would still pay...

1055
01:03:07.175 --> 01:03:09.632
# A penny
for your thoughts #


1056
01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:12.590
# A dime for your dreams #

1057
01:03:12.847 --> 01:03:15.680
# Would a shiny
new quarter #


1058
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:19.468
# Buy a peek
at your schemes #


1059
01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:22.846
# And when you are away #

1060
01:03:23.149 --> 01:03:25.856
# So far from my side #

1061
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:29.152
# I will cherish
my penny's worth #


1062
01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:32.648
# 'til at last
I'm your bride #


1063
01:03:37.956 --> 01:03:40.493
# A penny
for your thoughts #


1064
01:03:41.209 --> 01:03:43.666
# Let's call it a deal #

1065
01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:47.082
If I don't have
any secrets #


1066
01:03:47.507 --> 01:03:50.340
# You know
how I feel #


1067
01:03:50.552 --> 01:03:52.167
That's it. No, no, here, here.
Go right there.


1068
01:03:52.512 --> 01:03:54.002
- Where, where?
- The curl. You know where I like the curl.


1069
01:03:54.222 --> 01:03:56.884
- Ron, I have to get myself ready.
- There it is. There it is.


1070
01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.592
Nice. Now a little fluff here,
and you can work on yourself.


1071
01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:06.603
# A penny for your thoughts
it's settled and done #


1072
01:04:06.985 --> 01:04:09.897
# I'd have offered
a million #


1073
01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:13.276
# I'd have done it
for none #


1074
01:04:14.242 --> 01:04:17.109
# I reckon we're in love #

1075
01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.657
# And married we'll be #

1076
01:04:20.874 --> 01:04:23.832
# And all for a penny #

1077
01:04:24.043 --> 01:04:26.705
# A bright copper penny #

1078
01:04:26.921 --> 01:04:33.292
# The penny that
brought you to me #


1079
01:05:04.417 --> 01:05:07.659
It was so good.
I told you you'd be able to lift me like that.


1080
01:05:07.879 --> 01:05:10.541
Oh, you were right.
- You lifted me up!


1081
01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:14.582
Yes, after our brave fighting
boys returned from the war,

1082
01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.835
Things got back
to normal in Blaine,


1083
01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:20.301
Until one summer night
in 1946,


1084
01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:25.435
When unexpected visitors
put us back on the map.


1085
01:05:30.318 --> 01:05:32.183
- Where are we?
- How did we get here?


1086
01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:34.190
Is this a dream?

1087
01:05:36.741 --> 01:05:39.904
Look, what is it?

1088
01:05:40.119 --> 01:05:43.327
I don't know.
It looks like one of them new feed storage bins.


1089
01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.280
That ain't
no feed storage bin.


1090
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.583
- How did it get here?
- It must've flew.


1091
01:05:48.795 --> 01:05:50.331
But it don't have
any wings.


1092
01:05:50.505 --> 01:05:54.373
Then I guess it just dropped
from somewhere up there.


1093
01:05:54.926 --> 01:05:58.760
Citizens of Blaine,
do not be alarmed.


1094
01:05:59.097 --> 01:06:00.712
We will not harm you.

1095
01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:04.883
We come in peace
from a planet far, far away.


1096
01:06:05.103 --> 01:06:07.560
A place we call Mars.

1097
01:06:07.772 --> 01:06:10.138
- I've heard of Mars.
- Where's that?


1098
01:06:10.358 --> 01:06:13.646
Stand back and your
queries will be answered.


1099
01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:19.068
Look out!

1100
01:06:26.165 --> 01:06:29.953
- What do you want from us?
- Hey, good question, earthling.


1101
01:06:30.169 --> 01:06:34.708
It seemed like it was time for a change,
time to take a trip...


1102
01:06:35.133 --> 01:06:38.500
To see the exciting places
in the galaxy.


1103
01:06:38.845 --> 01:06:40.051
For you see...

1104
01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:42.720
# Nothing ever happens
on Mars #


1105
01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:47.471
# No sports or entertainment
or swingin' bars #


1106
01:06:48.021 --> 01:06:51.479
# You stand around
you stand some more #


1107
01:06:51.733 --> 01:06:55.772
# On the planet named
for a Roman god of war ii


1108
01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:58.899
# Nothing ever happens
on Mars #


1109
01:06:59.866 --> 01:07:03.825
# No supersonic airplanes
no sporty cars #


1110
01:07:04.037 --> 01:07:07.495
# The sun comes up
the sun goes down #


1111
01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:11.745
# You can't go through the country
you can't go to town #


1112
01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:15.962
# Boring, boring
boring, boring #


1113
01:07:16.174 --> 01:07:19.007
# Boring, boring
boring #


1114
01:07:19.218 --> 01:07:20.583
# Boring #

1115
01:07:29.103 --> 01:07:33.096
Well, the town of Blaine has packed
a lot in the last 150 years.

1116
01:07:33.566 --> 01:07:36.228
We've had our ups,
and we've had our downs.


1117
01:07:36.778 --> 01:07:40.066
We've seen our past,
and we look forward to the future.


1118
01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:44.733
And when the challenges come,
we'll greet 'em the way Americans always do:


1119
01:07:44.952 --> 01:07:47.785
With grit, determination
and pride.


1120
01:07:48.039 --> 01:07:52.123
Because that, my friends,
is America.


1121
01:07:52.377 --> 01:07:55.084
And nothin' says
America more to me...


1122
01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.294
Than Blaine!

1123
01:08:57.108 --> 01:09:00.441
Corky! Corky!

1124
01:09:09.036 --> 01:09:11.197
- You were good.
- You are so brilliant. You're brilliant.


1125
01:09:11.414 --> 01:09:13.450
Cliff, you're great.
Everyone was so great.


1126
01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:15.657
- Oh, Dr. Pearl!
- Oh, man.


1127
01:09:15.877 --> 01:09:17.708
- Corky, you did it!
- Oh, thank you.


1128
01:09:18.337 --> 01:09:21.545
I'm gonna get Mr. Guffman. I'll be right backstage.
- Okay.


1129
01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.467
That was great.

1130
01:09:28.806 --> 01:09:31.092
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi.


1131
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:33.846
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.


1132
01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.556
- Boffo socko, Corky.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you.


1133
01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:39.230
- Wait'll they hear about this at the next mayor's conference.
- Thank you so much.


1134
01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.686
Well, I know we have
a lot of work to do.


1135
01:09:41.903 --> 01:09:43.359
The first act needs...

1136
01:09:43.571 --> 01:09:45.857
- It was magical. God!
- Thank you very much, Steve.


1137
01:09:46.073 --> 01:09:47.313
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.


1138
01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:51.109
We've got the first act again.
It's just, you know, it's up and down.


1139
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:52.860
Kind of dippin' and that,
and I know that.


1140
01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.071
- We don't have the time to do everything.
- Yeah.


1141
01:09:55.374 --> 01:09:57.330
So, I'm gonna ask you
point-blank.


1142
01:09:57.794 --> 01:10:00.786
- Do we have a shot to go to Broadway?
- Yes, I think so.


1143
01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:04.915
Oh, oh, mama mia.
Oh, that is such good news.


1144
01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:07.090
I can't tell you
what news that is to me.


1145
01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:09.419
- Would you like to meet the cast?
- I'd like that. Yeah.


1146
01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:13.052
Oh, great.
Come on with me, you.


1147
01:10:17.563 --> 01:10:20.396
- That Blaine babe and I...
- Everybody!


1148
01:10:27.198 --> 01:10:28.187
Yes!

1149
01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:32.530
- Our cast.
- Thank you. You were just great.


1150
01:10:35.915 --> 01:10:38.577
Well, I'd like...
please, introduce yourselves.


1151
01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:40.749
Sheila.
Sheila Albertson.


1152
01:10:40.962 --> 01:10:42.702
- You were great.
- I was?


1153
01:10:42.922 --> 01:10:45.709
Mrs. Ron Albertson. I'm Ron Albertson.
A pleasure performing...


1154
01:10:47.134 --> 01:10:48.169
This came
a couple of hours ago.


1155
01:10:48.386 --> 01:10:50.923
- I'm sorry. I'm just now getting it to you.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.


1156
01:10:51.597 --> 01:10:54.304
Clifford Wooley. Nice to meet you.
- Mr. Wooley.


1157
01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:57.099
- Allan Pearl.
- You make me laugh.


1158
01:10:57.311 --> 01:10:59.973
Oh, oh.
It's a delight to meet you, sir.


1159
01:11:00.648 --> 01:11:05.062
Well, I'm sure that Mr.
Guffman would like to say a few words to us.


1160
01:11:05.278 --> 01:11:08.862
Hear, hear.
- Speech, speech, speech.


1161
01:11:10.324 --> 01:11:11.279
Well, I think there's
some mistake.


1162
01:11:11.492 --> 01:11:14.655
My name is Loomis, Roy Loomis.
I'm down from Deming.


1163
01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.782
I came down.
My niece had her first baby.


1164
01:11:16.998 --> 01:11:19.831
Uh, it's a boy, and
that's what the balloon is for.


1165
01:11:21.085 --> 01:11:25.545
I just wanted to tell you
how absolutely wonderful you all were.

1166
01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.331
And, uh, thank you.

1167
01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:31.213
And, uh, I'll be seeing ya
and bless you.


1168
01:11:31.429 --> 01:11:34.842
He's gonna love this.
Oh, boy.


1169
01:11:43.107 --> 01:11:46.895
Take our, uh, makeup off.

1170
01:12:05.504 --> 01:12:07.290
"Snowstorm in New York.

1171
01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:10.339
"All flights canceled.

1172
01:12:12.053 --> 01:12:13.293
Mort Guffman."

1173
01:12:34.575 --> 01:12:38.534
I think the one really
important thing that I learned,


1174
01:12:38.996 --> 01:12:42.580
Uh, from my whole experience
in working with Corky...


1175
01:12:43.167 --> 01:12:49.083
Is that I do
indeed have talent.


1176
01:12:50.424 --> 01:12:53.211
And a couple of things,
actually.


1177
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:58.304
B: I have to entertain.

1178
01:12:58.516 --> 01:13:00.131
I have to entertain.

1179
01:13:00.351 --> 01:13:04.469
And you have to go
where you are needed.


1180
01:13:04.689 --> 01:13:06.600
You have to go
where the crowds are.


1181
01:13:07.108 --> 01:13:08.814
And you have to go...

1182
01:13:09.193 --> 01:13:12.481
Where the love is.

1183
01:13:12.738 --> 01:13:17.357
And the love for me,
right now, is in Miami,


1184
01:13:17.868 --> 01:13:18.983
Not Blaine.

1185
01:13:19.787 --> 01:13:23.120
# My bubbe made a kishke
she made it big and fat #


1186
01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:25.072
# My zaydeh took
one look at it #


1187
01:13:25.292 --> 01:13:26.657
# And said
I can't eat that #


1188
01:13:26.877 --> 01:13:32.417
# Oh, mama, mama, mama
oh, mama, me, oh, my #


1189
01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:34.582
well, here we are
in the land of dreams.


1190
01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:37.586
And don't let anybody tell you
dreams can't come true.


1191
01:13:37.596 --> 01:13:39.427
- We're an hour from the snow.
- Uh-huh.


1192
01:13:39.598 --> 01:13:41.509
- We're twenty minutes from the ocean.
- Uh-huh.


1193
01:13:41.767 --> 01:13:43.632
- Two hours from the Mexico.
- Uh-huh.


1194
01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:46.265
- Five hours from Vegas.
- Uh, five hours from Las Vegas.


1195
01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.471
- And we're gonna get there one of these days. Yeah.
- Soon as we get a car.


1196
01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:51.558
We don't have a car yet.
Who wants to add to the pollution?


1197
01:13:51.902 --> 01:13:53.392
We consider ourselves
bi-coastal...


1198
01:13:53.612 --> 01:13:56.149
If you consider the Mississippi
river one of the coasts.

1199
01:13:56.657 --> 01:13:59.148
Uh...
- Extras, let's go. Over here.


1200
01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:02.155
All right. Time to get back to work.
That's what they're payin' us for.


1201
01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.453
- Come on, kid.
- Why can't they refer to us by name?


1202
01:14:04.999 --> 01:14:08.537
Why can't they say, "Ron, Sheila,
over this way, please"?


1203
01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:10.960
Still the same on the paycheck. Hi, how ya doin'?
- All right.


1204
01:14:11.172 --> 01:14:12.878
You're doin' a great job, incidentally.

1205
01:14:14.508 --> 01:14:16.169
- Smile.
- Are you gonna smile?


1206
01:14:16.594 --> 01:14:18.130
I think we should
have a line.


1207
01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:20.636
I gave him some suggestions.
He didn't want to hear it. He's busy.


1208
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:22.846
- Line dancing. We should be line dancing.
- That's a great idea.


1209
01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.845
Quiet, please.
All right.


1210
01:14:25.728 --> 01:14:28.845
Put your finger up like this. Are you smilin'?
- Quiet, please.


1211
01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:35.102
I was on my way to New York,
and then my dad got out of prison,


1212
01:14:35.821 --> 01:14:36.810
Which is good.

1213
01:14:37.948 --> 01:14:39.654
He was supposed to be
in there for ten years,


1214
01:14:39.867 --> 01:14:42.233
But, I guess, since he
didn't kill anybody...


1215
01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:46.200
And just
ruined some property...


1216
01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:48.865
That, um, they let him out
after five.


1217
01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:52.706
So, it's...
I'm here with my dad,


1218
01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:54.666
And, uh...

1219
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:59.717
I've been thinkin' of ice cream and
stuff and what I can do with it.

1220
01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:03.842
Maybe come up with... we have a blizzard,
and we have a breeze.


1221
01:15:04.517 --> 01:15:07.884
We have derbies,
and the derbies are really old.


1222
01:15:08.145 --> 01:15:10.807
They've been doin' derbies,
you know, the chocolate dipped,


1223
01:15:11.023 --> 01:15:13.730
For, I think,
twenty years or somethin'.


1224
01:15:15.319 --> 01:15:18.652
I really wanna
sort of make a healthy,


1225
01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:24.025
Low-fat or nonfat,
uh, healthy...


1226
01:15:27.164 --> 01:15:27.994
Blizzard.

1227
01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:33.626
The first thing I did when
I moved back to New York City...


1228
01:15:33.838 --> 01:15:35.624
Was to look up Mr. Guffman.

1229
01:15:36.507 --> 01:15:38.043
And he was so sweet.

1230
01:15:38.342 --> 01:15:40.378
And I think he felt
a little guilty too,


1231
01:15:40.594 --> 01:15:45.008
Because he's offered me the chance to
audition for his new Broadway show,


1232
01:15:45.224 --> 01:15:47.761
Which is a revival
of My Fair Lady.


1233
01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:50.263
It's one of my favorite shows
of all time.


1234
01:15:50.896 --> 01:15:53.808
And the role is
of Henry Higgins,


1235
01:15:54.066 --> 01:15:56.899
The somewhat
stern taskmaster,


1236
01:15:57.111 --> 01:15:59.568
But he-really-likes-her-anyway-
kind-of-thing guy,


1237
01:16:00.114 --> 01:16:02.981
Who teaches Eliza
how to speak correctly.


1238
01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.614
And she, of course,
is of the cockney persuasion and drops her H's.


1239
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:11.038
And I've been workin' on that at home,
the whole cockney thing of,


1240
01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:12.660
"'ello, 'ow are 'oo?

1241
01:16:13.252 --> 01:16:18.042
Do you want to go to 'artford?
Not live in this 'ell 'ole" and that kind of thing.


1242
01:16:18.257 --> 01:16:21.499
I think I'm honing in on it
pretty close now.


1243
01:16:22.052 --> 01:16:25.965
And I suppose that the "cake and eat
it too" part of this whole story is...

1244
01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:28.264
That another dream of mine
has come true,


1245
01:16:28.475 --> 01:16:32.059
Which is, I've gotten
to open this shop,


1246
01:16:32.271 --> 01:16:37.311
Where I have all my show
business treasures and all my memorabilia.

1247
01:16:38.152 --> 01:16:41.019
This is, without a doubt,
one of my favorite items,


1248
01:16:41.238 --> 01:16:44.230
Uh, my dinner with Andre
action figures.


1249
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:47.283
And what you can do,
which is so cute,


1250
01:16:47.494 --> 01:16:51.032
Is, uh, you can reenact
the whole scene,


1251
01:16:51.624 --> 01:16:56.288
You know, where the two guys talk to each other,
and say, you know,


1252
01:16:57.129 --> 01:16:59.996
"Boy, I'm sure glad you've
found a good restaurant.


1253
01:17:00.257 --> 01:17:01.872
It's so hard these days
to get in."


1254
01:17:02.092 --> 01:17:03.377
You know,
"Who do you know?"


1255
01:17:03.844 --> 01:17:08.338
"Oh, I just called, made a call,
spur of the moment."


1256
01:17:08.849 --> 01:17:12.467
"Oh, you. You can always
get a reservation."


1257
01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:15.219
You know, that's not
from the movie,


1258
01:17:15.481 --> 01:17:17.142
But you can make up
your own dialogue,


1259
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:19.310
Which is one of the great things
about action figures.


1260
01:17:20.361 --> 01:17:22.568
I'm trying to get...
it's very rare...


1261
01:17:22.863 --> 01:17:26.401
The one... the action figures for Das Boot,

1262
01:17:26.659 --> 01:17:29.025
'Cause I love to do
that whole, you know,


1263
01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.110
Kind of claustrophobic thing
inside the sub,


1264
01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:32.490
Where they're, you know...

1265
01:17:32.706 --> 01:17:36.449
you know,
that whole German thing.


1266
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:38.876
Can't speak German,
but it sounds like, uh, you know,


1267
01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:41.204
Sort of a bunch of
barnyard animals...


1268
01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:44.415
Mach-mach-mach-mach... you know,
making that noise and sweatin'.


1269
01:17:46.136 --> 01:17:49.094
Uh, over here,
these are my big heads,


1270
01:17:49.306 --> 01:17:52.389
I call' em, starting with
Anthony Michael Hall,


1271
01:17:52.643 --> 01:17:54.224
One of the "brat packers."

1272
01:17:54.728 --> 01:17:59.267
In fact,
there's... in the background there... there's Andrew McCarthy.


1273
01:18:00.651 --> 01:18:03.142
Over here is some new
lunch boxes we've gotten in.

1274
01:18:03.362 --> 01:18:05.603
They're Remains of the Day
lunch box.


1275
01:18:05.823 --> 01:18:08.530
And the kids,
they're just havin' such a good time with these.


1276
01:18:08.742 --> 01:18:11.700
You know, kids don't like
eating lunch at school,


1277
01:18:11.912 --> 01:18:16.076
But if they've got a Remains of the Day lunch box,
they're a whole lot happier.


1278
01:22:53.527 --> 01:22:59.113
# There's not much pleasure #

1279
01:22:59.324 --> 01:23:03.067
# But not much pain #

1280
01:23:03.287 --> 01:23:06.779
# 'cause nothin' ever happens #

1281
01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:11.709
# Zero ever happens #

1282
01:23:12.337 --> 01:23:17.877
# Bupkes ever happens in #

1283
01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:33.181
