00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:48.015
Hey, come in, come in.

3
00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:49.515
God, the weather's horrible,
isn't it?


4
00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:51.282
Yeah, absolutely.

5
00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.251
Take off your coat.
Here, give me that.


6
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:56.682
- So how are you?
- Good.


7
00:00:56.684 --> 00:00:59.182
- How's school?
- It's okay.


8
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:02.149
Well, thanks a million
for doing this.


9
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:03.484
Girls?

10
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.048
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi, Sophie.


11
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.182
Isabelle?

12
00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:11.449
She's annoyed because
I won't let her see <i>Jaws.</i>


13
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:13.251
It isn't fair!

14
00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:22.416
- So is it a date?
- Hmm?


15
00:01:22.418 --> 00:01:24.449
That you're going on.

16
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.451
None of your business.

17
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.084
No. It's just an old friend
I'm having a bite to eat with.


18
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.315
Can I get you some water
to start?


19
00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:55.684
Yeah, and a glass of whatever
the house red is would be great.


20
00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.351
Hi.

21
00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:35.384
Hi.

<i>♪♪</i>

23
00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:24.799
We've gone there
three years running,


24
00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:26.665
but we're getting sick of it
now, to be honest


25
00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.066
- Well, not sick of it, but...
- You could do with a change.


26
00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:30.598
- Couldn't we, Chris?
- Yeah.


27
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.664
- So where then?
- I don't know.


28
00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:33.832
We were thinking Italy, maybe,

29
00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:35.465
somewhere along
the Amalfi Coast?


30
00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:37.066
Positano I hear is nice.

31
00:03:37.068 --> 00:03:38.898
- Where?
- Positano?


32
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.632
- Right.
- No, I didn't know it either,


33
00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:42.932
but a friend of my sister
says it's very romantic.


34
00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:44.966
- Ooh!
- It's all romantic there.


35
00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:46.832
They're a pretty romantic race,
really, aren't they?


36
00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:49.565
That hot Mediterranean blood,
isn't that what they say?


37
00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:52.532
- Jim has a bit of that in him.
- What? Yeah, right.


38
00:03:52.534 --> 00:03:54.564
- [laughs]
- Jim works on holiday.


39
00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:57.166
- Do you?
- Well, I work to commission,


40
00:03:57.168 --> 00:03:59.132
so if something needs to be
done by a certain date,


41
00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:00.966
that's when
it has to be done by.


42
00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:02.931
- Oh, I couldn't do that. God!
- Me neither.


43
00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:05.632
When I'm away, I'm away
and to hell with work.


44
00:04:05.634 --> 00:04:08.032
Are you a holiday lover
at all, Chris?


45
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:11.498
Chris complains when a holiday's
coming up, don't you?


46
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.799
[laughs]
Do I?


47
00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:14.099
You know you do.

48
00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:16.431
But once he's there,
he enjoys it.


49
00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:17.799
That's often all
it's a matter of, isn't it?


50
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.732
Getting there? Oh, it is.

51
00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:22.166
I mean, straight away, you're
in a different frame of mind.


52
00:04:22.168 --> 00:04:24.699
Oh, some of us, anyway.

53
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:27.166
Gimme a break.
I still enjoy myself.


54
00:04:27.168 --> 00:04:29.832
I know. And we do spend
most of the day as a family.


55
00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:32.498
That's the best part, I think.
Just hanging out as a family.


56
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.032
It happens so rarely for us
these days, to be honest.


57
00:04:35.034 --> 00:04:37.166
And yeah,
it's always so lovely


58
00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:39.699
seeing Chris
spend time with the girls.


59
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.899
- What does that mean?
- Hmm?


60
00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:43.564
I spend as much time as I can
with the girls.


61
00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:44.966
I know you do.

62
00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:47.132
So why are you suggesting
that I don't?


63
00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:49.166
I'm not. What are you
talking about?


64
00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:51.532
I'm talking about you
implying something to people


65
00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:52.965
that isn't the case.

66
00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:56.132
- Oh, Chris...
- I don't think she was, Chris.


67
00:04:56.134 --> 00:04:58.534
That's what I'm
fucking talking about.


68
00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:04.999
I suppose it shows there's often
more going on in a marriage


69
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:07.599
than people outside of it
are ever aware of.


70
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:10.866
True.
Fairly ignorant all the same.


71
00:05:10.868 --> 00:05:14.034
Oh, absolutely. Be a prick in
your own bloody house, you know?


72
00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:18.732
Martina was going on
about that play again.


73
00:05:18.734 --> 00:05:21.699
- Right.
- It sounds really good.


74
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:23.032
What is it?

75
00:05:23.034 --> 00:05:24.966
I can't remember the name.

76
00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:26.932
- Who's it by?
- I don't know.


77
00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:30.532
Do you wanna maybe
go next week, though?


78
00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:32.765
Yeah, I suppose.

79
00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:34.631
You suppose?

80
00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:36.132
What, you want me
to get excited


81
00:05:36.134 --> 00:05:38.865
about a play you don't
even know the name of?


82
00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:40.632
It's a date, though.

83
00:05:40.634 --> 00:05:42.066
So?

84
00:05:42.068 --> 00:05:43.500
With me.

85
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:48.665
Yeah, I suppose.

86
00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:49.901
Asshole.

87
00:05:58.534 --> 00:06:00.465
[sighs]

88
00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:01.567
Yeah.

89
00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:09.534
You put the bins out,
didn't you?


90
00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:13.765
Fuck.

91
00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:15.532
- You were talking shit!
- I wasn't.


92
00:06:15.534 --> 00:06:17.465
You were, the three of you.
"Chris always complains!"


93
00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:19.199
- When have I ever complained...
- Chris!


94
00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:20.966
about spending time
with you and the girls?


95
00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:22.699
- That wasn't what I meant.
- Of course it was.


96
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.698
Or neglected them in any way?
Never.


97
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.565
- Why are you acting like this?
- Like what?


98
00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:28.465
And why do you expect me
to socialize with people


99
00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:30.066
that I've no fucking
interest in anyway?


100
00:06:30.068 --> 00:06:31.799
You know what? Do not make me
go over there again.


101
00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:33.099
You're trying
to put us together,


102
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.799
make us those kind
of fucking friends.


103
00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:36.799
I'm not! It's me and Danielle
who are friends.


104
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:39.765
Then be fucking friends
and leave me and Jim out of it!


105
00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.166
Do you understand me?

106
00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:43.966
Or include Jim
and leave me out of it!


107
00:06:43.968 --> 00:06:46.767
Either way,
leave me fuck out of it!


108
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.001
<i>[TV playing]</i>

109
00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.565
I'm going to bed.

110
00:06:59.567 --> 00:07:00.901
Good!

111
00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:04.532
I'll be sleeping
in Sophie's room.


112
00:07:04.534 --> 00:07:07.166
What the fuck do I care?

00:07:07.168 --> 00:07:08.966
TV: <i>Still a lot of clouds,</i>

<i>but with just the odd patch
of rain and drizzle.</i>


115
00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:14.493
<i>It'll be mild enough
with highs of around 79</i>

00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:18.295
<i>or 10 degrees with mostly
moderate southwest breezes.</i>

So did you get much homework?

118
00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:26.773
About the usual.

119
00:07:26.775 --> 00:07:28.407
- Ben?
- No, not really.


120
00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:31.074
No? Have you maths?

121
00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.374
Uh-huh.

122
00:07:32.376 --> 00:07:34.940
- Sentences?
- Yeah.


123
00:07:34.942 --> 00:07:36.474
So why are you saying,
"No, not really?"


124
00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:39.939
- I don't know.
- Because he's an idiot.

Shit!

126
00:07:41.876 --> 00:07:43.341

127
00:07:43.343 --> 00:07:45.007
Nothing.

Damn!

00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:47.773
You're an idiot.

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:51.274
- DANIELLE: <i>Again?</i>
- I know.

<i>Did you knock in
to Mrs. Conway?</i>


133
00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:55.707
Yeah, there's no one in.

<i>I can't come home, Jim.</i>

<i>What day is it?
And she'll be in.</i>


139
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:08.206
No, sure, I'll leave it.

140
00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.341
<i>You'll leave it? Why?</i>

141
00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:12.373
- After the other night?
- <i>Oh, give me a break.</i>


142
00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:15.007
- It'll be awkward, Danielle.
- <i>It won't be awkward.</i>


143
00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:18.040
<i>Look, I have to go, all right?
Knock in or don't.</i>


144
00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:20.007
- All right.
- <i>All right, bye-bye.</i>


145
00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:21.042
Bye.

146
00:08:25.908 --> 00:08:26.875
Well, Dad?

147
00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:34.273
Hi.

148
00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:36.141
No, it was when you had
your bathroom done,


149
00:08:36.143 --> 00:08:38.241
I think she needed it back,
so the guy could get in and out.


150
00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:40.440
Listen, you're welcome to hang
around here until she gets home.


151
00:08:40.442 --> 00:08:43.441
Ah, no. We wouldn't
wanna get in your way.


152
00:08:43.443 --> 00:08:45.773
Don't be silly.
What's the alternative anyway,


153
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.806
wander the streets
for the afternoon?


154
00:08:47.808 --> 00:08:50.007
Well, I was thinking we might go
and see a movie.


155
00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:52.040
Well, if that's what you
wanna do, then fine,


156
00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:53.939
but just so you know,
you're completely welcome.


157
00:08:53.941 --> 00:08:55.376
Thanks, Yvonne.

158
00:08:58.175 --> 00:09:01.840
So what, you don't work
Tuesdays and Thursdays?


159
00:09:01.842 --> 00:09:03.707
Yeah, just since recently,
actually.


160
00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.007
Right, and how do you
find that?


161
00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:07.441
Oh, it's great.

162
00:09:07.443 --> 00:09:09.907
I mean, even just in terms
of commuting, you know?


163
00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:12.207
- Where do you work again?
- Killester.


164
00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:14.407
So yeah, the fact that
I only have to get out there


165
00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:15.939
three times a week now
instead of five


166
00:09:15.941 --> 00:09:18.307
just makes
an enormous difference.


167
00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:20.807
'Course, you wouldn't have
those problems, I suppose.


168
00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:22.274
Or am I being presumptuous?

169
00:09:22.276 --> 00:09:24.273
- Working from home, you mean?
- Yeah.


170
00:09:24.275 --> 00:09:26.040
No, you're not,

171
00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:29.773
but working from home
can present its own challenges.


172
00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:31.441
Really? Like what?

173
00:09:31.443 --> 00:09:33.441
Well, like
keeping disciplined.


174
00:09:33.443 --> 00:09:35.141
Right.

175
00:09:35.143 --> 00:09:38.374
Resisting the urge to
fuck around on the Internet.


176
00:09:38.376 --> 00:09:40.074
Sorry. Shit.

177
00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:41.376
Actually...

178
00:09:45.343 --> 00:09:47.441
- Isabelle?
- Yeah?


179
00:09:47.443 --> 00:09:49.174
Are you guys all okay?

180
00:09:49.176 --> 00:09:50.940
ISABELLE: Yeah, we're fine.

181
00:09:50.942 --> 00:09:52.276
[clears throat]

182
00:09:57.909 --> 00:09:58.940
Go on.

183
00:09:58.942 --> 00:10:00.940
Fuck around on the Internet.

184
00:10:00.942 --> 00:10:05.007
Yeah, or watch TV.

185
00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:07.073
- Okay.
- Or go back to bed.


186
00:10:07.075 --> 00:10:08.207
Have you done that?

187
00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:09.274
Done what?

188
00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:11.407
Gone back to bed.

189
00:10:11.409 --> 00:10:12.940
Have you not?

190
00:10:12.942 --> 00:10:15.306
Maybe once or twice.

191
00:10:15.308 --> 00:10:18.274
You see? These are
the fucking temptations.


192
00:10:18.276 --> 00:10:19.243
[laughs]

193
00:10:26.741 --> 00:10:28.939
MAN #1: And how do you know?

194
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:30.441
MAN #2: She told me.

195
00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:31.939
She told you?

196
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:34.140
Yes.

197
00:10:34.142 --> 00:10:38.407
In fact, she even went so far
as to ask my permission.


198
00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:41.408
As if I'll have a say
in anything once I'm gone.


199
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.276
Permission to what?

200
00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:47.309
To be with you.

201
00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.107
And did you give it?

202
00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:55.107
Of course I did.

203
00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:57.343
I want her to be happy.

204
00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:04.042
Although there is one thing
I need to tell you about her.


205
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.074
And that night
didn't come up at all?


206
00:11:09.076 --> 00:11:11.940
- No.
- I told you it wouldn't.


207
00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:14.107
You said
it wouldn't be awkward.


208
00:11:14.109 --> 00:11:15.873
Was it?

209
00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:18.107
It was a bit, actually.
Spending three fucking hours


210
00:11:18.109 --> 00:11:19.740
hanging around
a stranger's house.


211
00:11:19.742 --> 00:11:21.707
She isn't a stranger, Jim.

212
00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:24.274
Oh, would you mind taking the
kids to town someday this week


213
00:11:24.276 --> 00:11:26.140
and getting Alannah
a new shirt for school?


214
00:11:26.142 --> 00:11:27.273
She's complaining
the one she has


215
00:11:27.275 --> 00:11:28.874
is getting
too small for her.


216
00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:31.274
Right. Yeah, sure,
we might go in tomorrow.


217
00:11:31.276 --> 00:11:32.276
Thanks.

218
00:11:35.309 --> 00:11:38.907
So what else
did you not like?


219
00:11:38.909 --> 00:11:40.839
- About the play?
- Yeah.


220
00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:43.309
What else did you not like?

221
00:11:46.276 --> 00:11:48.007
Well?

222
00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:49.441
ALANNAH: What?

223
00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:51.374
- How is it?
- Fine.


224
00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:53.074
Does it fit?

225
00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:55.876
I wouldn't say "fine"
if it didn't, Dad.


226
00:11:58.842 --> 00:12:00.174
I'm hungry.

227
00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:03.739
[Alannah speaking Latin]

228
00:12:03.741 --> 00:12:05.875
- Now, everything good?
- Great, thank you.


229
00:12:08.376 --> 00:12:10.207
Dad.

230
00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:12.106
Oh, actually...

231
00:12:12.108 --> 00:12:14.040
were the wraps supposed
to come with chips?


232
00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:15.840
They were, yeah.
Why? Did you not get any?


233
00:12:15.842 --> 00:12:17.907
- No.
- Do you want them now?


234
00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:20.174
No, that's fine.
We're just gonna go now.


235
00:12:20.176 --> 00:12:22.407
So what do you want?

236
00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:23.974
Sorry?

237
00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:27.341
What do you want?

238
00:12:27.343 --> 00:12:28.940
Nothing. I just was wondering
if I misunderstood the menu,


239
00:12:28.942 --> 00:12:30.441
that's all.

240
00:12:30.443 --> 00:12:31.675
Right.

241
00:12:35.243 --> 00:12:37.341
Actually, sorry,
you know what?


242
00:12:37.343 --> 00:12:38.840
I hate to make a fuss,

243
00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.273
but is that the attitude
you have to take?


244
00:12:40.275 --> 00:12:42.907
- What do you mean?
- Would a simple apology


245
00:12:42.909 --> 00:12:44.473
not be possible without...

246
00:12:44.475 --> 00:12:46.473
- An apology?
- Yeah.


247
00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:48.840
It's not my fault your chips
didn't come with your wraps.


248
00:12:48.842 --> 00:12:51.307
- I never said it was.
- It's the kitchen's.


249
00:12:51.309 --> 00:12:54.174
That's fine. I'm just saying,
you know,


250
00:12:54.176 --> 00:12:56.207
out of, Jesus,
common courtesy...


251
00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:58.407
- Ah, yeah.
- What?


252
00:12:58.409 --> 00:13:01.073
Listen, I don't know
what your problem is,


253
00:13:01.075 --> 00:13:02.740
but I've far more
important things to be doing


254
00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:04.840
than dealing
with this crap.


255
00:13:04.842 --> 00:13:07.742
Go and find someone else
to fucking abuse, all right?


256
00:13:17.343 --> 00:13:19.174
Dad...

257
00:13:19.176 --> 00:13:21.707
she said the F-word.

258
00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:22.642
I know.

259
00:13:35.176 --> 00:13:37.241
YVONNE: Hey!

260
00:13:37.243 --> 00:13:39.739
- Oh, hey. How are you?
- Good. Good.


261
00:13:39.741 --> 00:13:41.174
- You going home?
- Yeah.


262
00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:43.740
- Cool. Hi, girls.
- Hi.


263
00:13:43.742 --> 00:13:45.040
So where were you, town?

264
00:13:45.042 --> 00:13:47.006
Yes, getting a shirt
for Alannah.


265
00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:48.773
I see!

266
00:13:48.775 --> 00:13:50.874
- What about you?
- Post office.


267
00:13:50.876 --> 00:13:52.474
- Mam, can we get a treat?
- No.


268
00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:55.373
- Please?
- Dad, can we get a treat?


269
00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:57.040
I tell you what. We have
some chocolate bars at home


270
00:13:57.042 --> 00:13:58.406
if you'd like one.

271
00:13:58.408 --> 00:14:01.341
- Sorry, is that okay?
- Yeah, of course.


272
00:14:01.343 --> 00:14:02.739
What do you say, guys?

273
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:04.107
What kind of chocolate bars?

274
00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:06.706
And did you complain
to the manager?


275
00:14:06.708 --> 00:14:08.707
Yeah, absolutely.

276
00:14:08.709 --> 00:14:10.174
I mean, I'm not the type
that normally would,


277
00:14:10.176 --> 00:14:13.140
but this woman was
fucking obnoxious, Yvonne.


278
00:14:13.142 --> 00:14:15.840
- No, she sounds it, all right.
- And in front of my kids?


279
00:14:15.842 --> 00:14:17.740
No, I mean, there's a limit

280
00:14:17.742 --> 00:14:20.874
to the amount of that kind of
shit you can tolerate, you know?


281
00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:22.007
Anyway...

282
00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:24.241
- [chuckles]
- Dad!


283
00:14:24.243 --> 00:14:27.174
- Yeah?
- Look at this.


284
00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:29.409
All right, hang on.

285
00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:39.276
Cool!

286
00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:45.207
Do you ever notice how
once you start measuring time


287
00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:46.707
by the age of your kids...

288
00:14:46.709 --> 00:14:49.007
What, how quickly
it seems to be passing?


289
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:50.040
Yeah.

290
00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:52.374
Oh, yeah, definitely.

291
00:14:52.376 --> 00:14:53.974
I mean,
just looking at Ben there,


292
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.939
I remember him being
six or seven months old,


293
00:14:56.941 --> 00:14:59.707
and me cleaning his shit
and thinking,


294
00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:00.939
"When is he gonna
be old enough


295
00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:02.140
I don't have to do this
anymore?"


296
00:15:02.142 --> 00:15:03.707
- And then...
- Gone.


297
00:15:03.709 --> 00:15:05.940
Like that.
I mean, eight, nine years...


298
00:15:05.942 --> 00:15:07.940
- And you're that much older.
- That's right.


299
00:15:07.942 --> 00:15:10.340
- That's the scary thing.
- Well, that's what I'm saying.


300
00:15:10.342 --> 00:15:13.406
Before we had kids, it seemed
to go by so much more slowly.


301
00:15:13.408 --> 00:15:15.474
And now it's like,
"What the fuck?"


302
00:15:15.476 --> 00:15:17.341
- I know.
- What happened?


303
00:15:17.343 --> 00:15:19.341
I'll tell you
what I find weird, will I?


304
00:15:19.343 --> 00:15:22.141
Whenever I look at photographs
of the girls,


305
00:15:22.143 --> 00:15:24.174
like when they were younger,

306
00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:26.940
I kind of don't remember them
ever looking like that.


307
00:15:26.942 --> 00:15:28.940
What do you mean?

308
00:15:28.942 --> 00:15:30.907
I mean, in my head,

309
00:15:30.909 --> 00:15:32.807
it seems like they've always
looked exactly like


310
00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:34.740
they look right now,
you know?


311
00:15:34.742 --> 00:15:37.876
Those younger kids are
different people altogether.


312
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:42.774
Or is that just me?

313
00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:45.407
It might be just you.

00:24:54.242 --> 00:24:56.173
No, I know what you mean.

475
00:24:56.175 --> 00:24:59.007
If this was an Updike novel,
we'd have an affair now.


476
00:24:59.009 --> 00:25:00.375
Mm.

477
00:25:11.409 --> 00:25:13.309
Have you ever had one?

478
00:25:15.075 --> 00:25:16.041
What?

479
00:25:17.242 --> 00:25:19.907
An affair.

480
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:22.942
No. No.

481
00:25:26.276 --> 00:25:28.307
What about you?

482
00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:30.276
Thinking about it.

483
00:25:32.343 --> 00:25:35.108
- I'm joking.
- [laughs]


484
00:25:44.408 --> 00:25:46.874
Why would you have an affair?

485
00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:48.209
I don't know.

486
00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:51.840
- To punish him?
- Chris.


487
00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:54.040
Yeah.

488
00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:55.209
Right.

489
00:26:00.808 --> 00:26:02.240
So...

490
00:26:02.242 --> 00:26:03.675
what happens next?

491
00:26:06.443 --> 00:26:08.709
Go home, I suppose.

492
00:26:10.242 --> 00:26:11.740
Is that stupid?

493
00:26:11.742 --> 00:26:14.807
No, not at all.

494
00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:18.007
I mean, I think
you should talk to him.


495
00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:19.307
Right.

496
00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:22.309
At the very least, you know?

497
00:26:34.709 --> 00:26:36.707
Would you mind terribly
if I went back up to bed


498
00:26:36.709 --> 00:26:38.074
for half an hour?

499
00:26:38.076 --> 00:26:41.141
No, not at all.
God, take as long as you need.

- I'm sorry, Jim.
- Hang on.

Danielle, my friend
and everything.

would I say that?


505
00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:00.240
- Listen...
- Jesus! I have to go, Jim.


506

Hang on a second.

507
00:27:01.408 --> 00:27:03.007
Why the fuck
would I say that?


508
00:27:03.009 --> 00:27:04.739
- Because you're emotional.
- Christ!


509
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:08.141
Listen. And upset
and whatever else. Confused.


510
00:27:08.143 --> 00:27:09.839
I understand, Yvonne,
all right?


511
00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:11.474
- I'm so fucking embarrassed.
- Don't be.

And don't think... Jesus!

Don't think that I haven't,
you know, thought about you

00:27:16.242 --> 00:27:17.707
in that way either.

515
00:27:17.709 --> 00:27:19.373
- No, you haven't.
- No, I have.


516
00:27:19.375 --> 00:27:21.206
You haven't.
You're only saying that


517
00:27:21.208 --> 00:27:22.974
to make me feel like
less of a fucking fool,


518
00:27:22.976 --> 00:27:24.473
and God bless you for it

519
00:27:24.475 --> 00:27:27.840
Look, just wait a minute.

520
00:27:27.842 --> 00:27:29.806
Give me your hand.

521
00:27:29.808 --> 00:27:32.341
Just give it to me.

that's going?


523

Feel mine.

00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:58.409
Feel my breast.

Oh, God,
I'm so fucking wet.


531
00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:28.274
That's silly because the demon
is scared of the sword,


532
00:28:28.276 --> 00:28:31.474
and there's no way a demon
would be scared of a sword

unless is was powered,
and it wasn't powered.

Not long after.

And what did she say?

She said to say thanks for
getting the kids out to school.

00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:18.142
God, what the hell
are we like?


639
00:36:51.308 --> 00:36:54.141
- Hi, guys!
- Mam!


640
00:36:54.143 --> 00:36:56.207
- We made crystals today!
- You what?


641
00:36:56.209 --> 00:36:58.407
- In school.
- You made crystals?


642
00:36:58.409 --> 00:37:01.939
And Eleanor Donoghue got sick
all over the floor.


643
00:37:01.941 --> 00:37:03.342
Oh, no!

644
00:37:08.408 --> 00:37:10.073
I'm gonna fall off!

645
00:37:10.075 --> 00:37:12.175
I'm gonna fall off!
I'm gonna fall off!


646
00:37:37.475 --> 00:37:39.143
[exhales]

647
00:37:41.908 --> 00:37:44.441
<i>Then after the girls and I
got back to the house,</i>


648
00:37:44.443 --> 00:37:46.939
<i>I had to go up to the bathroom
and masturbate.</i>


649
00:37:46.941 --> 00:37:50.140
- Yvonne...
- <i>I'm serious.</i>


650
00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:52.939
<i>That's how much
I'm aching for you.</i>


651
00:37:52.941 --> 00:37:54.440
Well, where the hell
are you anyway?


652
00:37:54.442 --> 00:37:57.273
At home. Chris is collecting
the girls from camogie.


653
00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.807
<i>Oh, right.</i>

654
00:37:59.809 --> 00:38:01.306
Are you aching for me?

655
00:38:01.308 --> 00:38:03.772
Yeah, of course.

656
00:38:03.774 --> 00:38:06.739
I can't believe it's Tuesday
before I get to see you again.


657
00:38:06.741 --> 00:38:09.473
And what'll you do
in the meantime?


658
00:38:09.475 --> 00:38:10.939
<i>What do you mean?</i>

659
00:38:10.941 --> 00:38:12.839
Well, are you gonna
masturbate?


660
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:14.374
Jesus. Stop, will you?

661
00:38:14.376 --> 00:38:15.873
<i>Are you?</i>

662
00:38:15.875 --> 00:38:17.441
Yeah, probably.

663
00:38:17.443 --> 00:38:20.406
Who will you fantasize about
while you're doing it?


664
00:38:20.408 --> 00:38:22.340
Who the hell do you think?

665
00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:25.240
- Tell me.
- You, of course.


666
00:38:25.242 --> 00:38:28.841
And what'll you fantasize about
doing to me?


667
00:39:02.208 --> 00:39:04.341
And I so much wanted
the yellow one.


668
00:39:04.343 --> 00:39:05.772
Right.

669
00:39:05.774 --> 00:39:08.273
I thought it was
so fucking beautiful.


670
00:39:08.275 --> 00:39:10.840
But no.

671
00:39:10.842 --> 00:39:14.440
My sister got that one,
and I got the pink.


672
00:39:14.442 --> 00:39:16.874
And I had
such a fucking tantrum.


673
00:39:16.876 --> 00:39:17.907
Really?

674
00:39:17.909 --> 00:39:19.209
Oh, yeah.

675
00:39:20.808 --> 00:39:24.341
I mean, I was only six.

676
00:39:24.343 --> 00:39:26.839
Even now...

677
00:39:26.841 --> 00:39:30.039
Even with her gone
these 15 years,


678
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:32.975
I still feel so guilty
about it.


679
00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:37.308
My poor mother.

680
00:39:42.841 --> 00:39:44.109
What?

681
00:39:46.975 --> 00:39:48.243
Nothing.

682
00:39:53.376 --> 00:39:54.675
You're lovely.

683
00:39:57.842 --> 00:39:59.675
This is lovely.

684
00:40:01.442 --> 00:40:02.674
What?

685
00:40:04.475 --> 00:40:08.307
Just being here.

686
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:10.109
Just talking.

687
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:18.409
I feel very close to you
these days.


688
00:40:20.108 --> 00:40:21.840
Is it all right to say that?

689
00:40:21.842 --> 00:40:24.206
Why wouldn't it be?

690
00:40:24.208 --> 00:40:27.040
I don't know.

691
00:40:27.042 --> 00:40:29.842
I feel very close to you too.

692
00:40:33.741 --> 00:40:37.975
What if, next time we met,
we did something risky?


693
00:40:40.008 --> 00:40:41.441
Like what?

694
00:40:41.443 --> 00:40:45.106
Like...

695
00:40:45.108 --> 00:40:47.773
went for a walk
on the beach.


696
00:40:47.775 --> 00:40:48.874
Why?

697
00:40:48.876 --> 00:40:49.974
To be romantic.

698
00:40:49.976 --> 00:40:52.342
To be romantic?

699
00:40:55.808 --> 00:40:58.007
But... did we not say

700
00:40:58.009 --> 00:41:01.341
we wouldn't let things
get beyond this room?


701
00:41:01.343 --> 00:41:03.973
We did.

702
00:41:03.975 --> 00:41:05.409
So?

703
00:41:07.142 --> 00:41:09.975
That's why
it'd be a risk, see?


704
00:41:12.876 --> 00:41:14.940
- She said I could.
- And what did her mother say?


705
00:41:14.942 --> 00:41:16.273
- She didn't ask her.
- Shut up.


706
00:41:16.275 --> 00:41:18.141
So this is all theoretical.

707
00:41:18.143 --> 00:41:19.406
- No.
- Until her mother's been asked,


708
00:41:19.408 --> 00:41:21.174
it is, love.

709
00:41:21.176 --> 00:41:23.274
Well, theoretically then,
would you let me stay over?


710
00:41:23.276 --> 00:41:26.739
What do you think? Chris.

711
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:29.706
Should we not invite Danielle
and Jim down some night soon?


712
00:41:29.708 --> 00:41:31.206
- And Alannah and Ben?
- What, for dinner?


713
00:41:31.208 --> 00:41:32.939
- Yeah.
- And Alannah and Ben, Dad?


714
00:41:32.941 --> 00:41:35.206
- No.
- Why?


715
00:41:35.208 --> 00:41:36.874
I don't know.
So I can apologize


716
00:41:36.876 --> 00:41:40.073
for being so obnoxious
in their house that night.


717
00:41:40.075 --> 00:41:42.440
- And, you know.
- Right.


718
00:41:42.442 --> 00:41:44.940
What does "obnoxious" mean?

719
00:41:44.942 --> 00:41:48.307
Uh, kinda nasty.

720
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:51.174
What did you do?

721
00:41:51.176 --> 00:41:54.240
- I was ignorant.
- You were ignorant?


722
00:41:54.242 --> 00:41:57.039
- Yeah.
- Of what?


723
00:41:57.041 --> 00:42:01.840
Of the fact that everything
isn't all about me.


724
00:42:01.842 --> 00:42:05.708
Something we'd all do very well
to remember occasionally.


725
00:42:07.009 --> 00:42:08.143
Huh?

726
00:42:11.143 --> 00:42:12.243
So what do you think?

727
00:42:13.875 --> 00:42:15.939
JIM: No, I suppose
that's fair enough.


728
00:42:15.941 --> 00:42:17.739
I mean, it'll be weird.

729
00:42:17.741 --> 00:42:19.039
Yeah.

730
00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:20.906
And we'll have to be,
both of us,


731
00:42:20.908 --> 00:42:23.707
careful not to refer to
conversations we've had.


732
00:42:23.709 --> 00:42:26.440
- That's true.
- Or things we've done.


733
00:42:26.442 --> 00:42:28.773
Like that time we had sex
in the dunes.


734
00:42:28.775 --> 00:42:30.373
That time we what?

735
00:42:30.375 --> 00:42:32.206
- Come over here for a minute.
- Where?


736
00:42:32.208 --> 00:42:34.373
- Just over here.
- Jim...


737
00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:36.007
I'm not gonna go in there
with you. You're joking.


738
00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:38.706
- It's the middle of winter.
- All right.


739
00:42:38.708 --> 00:42:41.674
"That time we had sex
in the dunes."


740
00:42:52.108 --> 00:42:55.140
- What?
- My legs are fucking freezing.


741
00:42:55.142 --> 00:42:56.473
Do you wanna stop?

742
00:42:56.475 --> 00:42:57.976
God, no.

743
00:43:03.176 --> 00:43:05.207
TEENAGER: Jesus!

744
00:43:05.209 --> 00:43:06.772
[laughing]

745
00:43:06.774 --> 00:43:07.975
Oh, God.

746
00:43:09.774 --> 00:43:12.342
[teenagers laughing]

747
00:43:16.342 --> 00:43:18.874
- You all right?
- Yeah.


748
00:43:18.876 --> 00:43:20.440
Have nothing better to do?

749
00:43:20.442 --> 00:43:21.940
Than watch you get
your hole, man?


750
00:43:21.942 --> 00:43:23.440
No, I don't think so.

751
00:43:23.442 --> 00:43:26.741
Would you not keep going?
You're just deadly.


752
00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:32.474
Hey, give us a look at
your fanny there, missus.


753
00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:34.772
- Ignore them.
- Ah, come on.


754
00:43:34.774 --> 00:43:37.240
- You dirty fucking slapper you.
- Jim...


755
00:43:37.242 --> 00:43:38.742
Who said that?

756
00:43:39.842 --> 00:43:40.809
I did.

757
00:43:42.408 --> 00:43:44.375
Your mother's a dirty slapper.

758
00:43:46.808 --> 00:43:48.174
Say that again?

759
00:43:48.176 --> 00:43:50.107
- Jim...
- Look...


760
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:51.376
Say it again.

761
00:43:56.741 --> 00:43:58.407
- No.
- Terrible, isn't it?


762
00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:00.740
- Jesus.
- So where did it happen?


763
00:44:00.742 --> 00:44:03.906
Lombard Street just around from
a place I'm doing some work for.


764
00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:06.039
- Were you talking?
- Just sending a text.


765
00:44:06.041 --> 00:44:07.807
- To me.
- To Danielle.


766
00:44:07.809 --> 00:44:10.206
This fella comes out of nowhere
and grabs it or tries to.


767
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:12.906
As soon as he sees I won't
let go, it was like bang!


768
00:44:12.908 --> 00:44:14.839
- God.
- Right in the... No, I know,


769
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:18.039
And off he runs down into...
You know those flats down there?


770
00:44:18.041 --> 00:44:19.374
And did you tell the police?

771
00:44:19.376 --> 00:44:21.006
His face didn't even register.

772
00:44:21.008 --> 00:44:22.906
I mean, if he was
sitting here at this table,


773
00:44:22.908 --> 00:44:24.406
I wouldn't recognize him.

774
00:44:24.408 --> 00:44:27.939
I would, of course,
but you know what I mean.


775
00:44:27.941 --> 00:44:29.874
Added to which,
I hung onto the phone.


776
00:44:29.876 --> 00:44:31.874
- Aren't you great?
- Fuck you.


777
00:44:31.876 --> 00:44:33.240
No, you did well
to hang onto it.


778
00:44:33.242 --> 00:44:34.909
- Didn't he?
- Absolutely.


779
00:44:45.376 --> 00:44:48.039
Anyway, thanks for coming,

780
00:44:48.041 --> 00:44:52.973
after my behavior
last time we were together.


781
00:44:52.975 --> 00:44:56.473
And of course,
other things that occurred.


782
00:44:56.475 --> 00:44:58.242
You can't ever
do it again, Chris.


783
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:01.473
What?

784
00:45:01.475 --> 00:45:03.774
You can't ever hit her again.

785
00:45:08.975 --> 00:45:10.075
I know.

786
00:45:11.774 --> 00:45:13.206
- I mean it. Ever.
- Danielle...


787
00:45:13.208 --> 00:45:15.342
No, no, no, that's fine.

788
00:45:16.842 --> 00:45:19.273
You have to be
better than that.


789
00:45:19.275 --> 00:45:21.940
And I will.

790
00:45:21.942 --> 00:45:24.974
I will, and, see, that's...

791
00:45:24.976 --> 00:45:28.373
I wanted to make that promise,

792
00:45:28.375 --> 00:45:31.073
and to apologize to you both

793
00:45:31.075 --> 00:45:33.374
and to you again, Yvonne.

794
00:45:33.376 --> 00:45:35.073
- Chris...
- No, seriously.


795
00:45:35.075 --> 00:45:38.806
And for the fact
that it happened first


796
00:45:38.808 --> 00:45:43.473
and for the fact that you guys
had to be such a part of it all


797
00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:45.408
in the way that you were.

798
00:45:53.475 --> 00:45:54.941
Okay.

799
00:45:56.243 --> 00:45:57.341
Is that okay?

800
00:45:57.343 --> 00:46:00.039
That's fine.

801
00:46:00.041 --> 00:46:01.342
All right.

802
00:46:05.842 --> 00:46:09.240
So will we move on to something
less, I don't know, awkward now?


803
00:46:09.242 --> 00:46:10.240
Absolutely.

804
00:46:10.242 --> 00:46:11.408
Good idea.

805
00:46:19.108 --> 00:46:20.841
[laughs]

806
00:46:33.942 --> 00:46:35.940
Hey, listen, um...

807
00:46:35.942 --> 00:46:39.306
I wanted to say
thank you for not,


808
00:46:39.308 --> 00:46:40.806
you know, not saying
anything about...


809
00:46:40.808 --> 00:46:43.241
Oh, right. No, of course.

810
00:46:43.243 --> 00:46:46.906
- How are you?
- Yeah, I'm okay.


811
00:46:46.908 --> 00:46:49.806
But how are you really?

812
00:46:49.808 --> 00:46:51.474
Not great.

813
00:46:51.476 --> 00:46:54.173
But I'm okay, okay?

814
00:46:54.175 --> 00:46:57.807
And... are you ever
gonna say anything?


815
00:46:57.809 --> 00:46:59.140
No, you know...

816
00:46:59.142 --> 00:47:00.974
But you know what it is?

817
00:47:00.976 --> 00:47:02.940
We're in a really good place
at the moment,


818
00:47:02.942 --> 00:47:05.340
and I just feel like
the later I leave it,


819
00:47:05.342 --> 00:47:09.142
the less time they'll have to
spend fucking dealing with it.


820
00:47:10.376 --> 00:47:13.206
But I know. I do, I do.

821
00:47:13.208 --> 00:47:15.806
I will tell her.
Just...


822
00:47:15.808 --> 00:47:21.974
Right. Well, look if you ever
want to talk again or...


823
00:47:21.976 --> 00:47:23.440
- I appreciate that.
- Anything.


824
00:47:23.442 --> 00:47:26.242
I appreciate that.
Cheers.


825
00:47:31.276 --> 00:47:33.341
- Anyway, I'll, uh...
- Yeah, sure, yeah.


826
00:47:33.343 --> 00:47:35.407
He says it himself.
He's only really productive


827
00:47:35.409 --> 00:47:37.873
four, five hours at the most
each day.


828
00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:40.006
So I'm lucky the rest
of the time he's around


829
00:47:40.008 --> 00:47:43.408
and willing to take care of
the responsibilities I can't.


830
00:47:46.008 --> 00:47:47.206
What?

831
00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:50.440
Nothing.
Singing your praises.


832
00:47:50.442 --> 00:47:53.107
No, but it is about valuing
what we have, isn't it?


833
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:54.440
- Definitely.
- 'Cause that's when the rot


834
00:47:54.442 --> 00:47:57.207
begins to set in
in most relationships, yeah.


835
00:47:57.209 --> 00:47:59.474
It's like you were saying,
Chris, you know,


836
00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.240
if you start with
what you have,


837
00:48:01.242 --> 00:48:03.206
taking it for granted,
am I right?


838
00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:05.306
- What's that?
- Because you can't.


839
00:48:05.308 --> 00:48:08.173
Because, Jesus, we all have a
lot of shit to be thankful for.


840
00:48:08.175 --> 00:48:09.773
I mean, don't we?

841
00:48:09.775 --> 00:48:11.406
The fact that someone,
say, could get sick,


842
00:48:11.408 --> 00:48:13.739
or one of the children
could get sick,


843
00:48:13.741 --> 00:48:15.406
it can happen
to anyone though.


844
00:48:15.408 --> 00:48:17.839
So we just have to remind
ourselves that...


845
00:48:17.841 --> 00:48:20.006
Or maybe you don't.

846
00:48:20.008 --> 00:48:21.806
- No, maybe you do though.
- Remind yourself what?


847
00:48:21.808 --> 00:48:23.973
That your happiness
is fragile,


848
00:48:23.975 --> 00:48:26.273
and we're all just hanging onto
it by the skin of our teeth.


849
00:48:26.275 --> 00:48:27.873
- All right, enough.
- What?


850
00:48:27.875 --> 00:48:29.340
Depressing talk.

851
00:48:29.342 --> 00:48:31.773
I don't wanna think
about that. We're fine.


852
00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:34.807
- We're all fine.
- All right.


853
00:48:34.809 --> 00:48:36.739
We're cool, thank God.

854
00:48:36.741 --> 00:48:40.107
Let's just open
another bottle of wine.


855
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:42.009
[laughing]

856
00:48:45.941 --> 00:48:48.741
Dad, are you gonna be
much longer in there?


857
00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:52.039
- Dad.
- What?


858
00:48:52.041 --> 00:48:54.373
- I need to brush my teeth.
- Use the other bathroom.


859
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:56.242
Isabelle's in there.

860
00:48:58.108 --> 00:48:59.942
Are you doing a poo?

861
00:49:01.108 --> 00:49:02.375
Are you doing a poo, Dad?

862
00:49:05.308 --> 00:49:08.209
Dad, are you doing a poo?

863
00:49:18.242 --> 00:49:22.874
It's kind of confusing,
I suppose,


864
00:49:22.876 --> 00:49:27.007
because now I find myself
reassessing whether it ever was.


865
00:49:27.009 --> 00:49:28.142
Right.

866
00:49:29.375 --> 00:49:31.674
Proper love, like.

867
00:49:33.209 --> 00:49:35.209
Was it something else.

868
00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:38.309
Like what?

869
00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:42.242
Convenience, maybe?

870
00:49:43.774 --> 00:49:46.173
I don't know.

871
00:49:46.175 --> 00:49:48.842
The bond we had
through the girls.


872
00:49:53.142 --> 00:49:57.839
You can just fall out of love
with someone though.


873
00:49:57.841 --> 00:49:59.209
True.

874
00:50:01.343 --> 00:50:04.142
Without even knowing it,
you know?


875
00:50:05.476 --> 00:50:08.342
Are you still in love
with Danielle?


876
00:50:14.041 --> 00:50:16.108
I suppose I am, yeah.

877
00:50:24.343 --> 00:50:26.006
What is it?

878
00:50:26.008 --> 00:50:28.073
Nothing.

879
00:50:28.075 --> 00:50:30.941
- Yvonne...
- Then why are you doing this?


880
00:50:32.142 --> 00:50:34.773
Why are you here with me?

881
00:50:34.775 --> 00:50:36.740
Because unfortunately...

882
00:50:36.742 --> 00:50:38.807
- Hey.
- What?


883
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:39.909
Look at me.

884
00:50:48.142 --> 00:50:50.140
Because unfortunately,

885
00:50:50.142 --> 00:50:54.375
what I feel for you
is far stronger.


886
00:50:58.875 --> 00:51:02.942
Then what are we still doing
in this fucking hotel room?


887
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:07.473
Yvonne...

888
00:51:07.475 --> 00:51:10.641
- Just leave it.
- I don't wanna leave it.


889
00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:15.774
Will you fucking talk to me,
for fuck sake?


890
00:51:27.008 --> 00:51:28.073
I'm sorry.

891
00:51:28.075 --> 00:51:29.974
For what?

892
00:51:29.976 --> 00:51:33.308
All along I promised myself
I wouldn't let it...


893
00:51:35.375 --> 00:51:39.341
But it's just sort of happened
without my noticing.


894
00:51:39.343 --> 00:51:40.941
What has?

895
00:51:45.075 --> 00:51:46.707
Yvonne...

896
00:51:46.709 --> 00:51:49.008
How badly I've fucking
fallen for you, Jim.


897
00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:55.040
And I don't wanna give you
an ultimatum.


898
00:51:55.042 --> 00:51:58.806
I don't, so please don't think
that's what I'm doing,


899
00:51:58.808 --> 00:52:01.641
but I just can't continue
like this. I'm...


900
00:52:04.142 --> 00:52:07.108
It's become
too fucking painful for me.


901
00:52:11.775 --> 00:52:13.742
So what do you wanna do?

902
00:52:15.708 --> 00:52:17.706
- I don't know.
- Do you wanna end it?


903
00:52:17.708 --> 00:52:20.406
- Do you?
- No.


904
00:52:20.408 --> 00:52:22.873
Me neither.

905
00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:27.073
You've no fucking idea how badly
I want to be with you.


906
00:52:27.075 --> 00:52:29.242
But not like this.

907
00:52:31.308 --> 00:52:33.275
I can't anymore.

908
00:52:42.308 --> 00:52:46.839
Uh... so what are you saying?

909
00:52:46.841 --> 00:52:50.307
Are you saying
that you'd walk out on Chris?


910
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:52.073
Yes.

911
00:52:52.075 --> 00:52:56.140
- If you wanted me to, I would.
- Yvonne...


912
00:52:56.142 --> 00:52:58.039
If you were prepared
to do the same.


913
00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:00.008
Jesus.

914
00:53:04.809 --> 00:53:07.706
You're really putting me
on the spot here, you know that?


915
00:53:07.708 --> 00:53:09.076
I know.

916
00:53:10.841 --> 00:53:12.708
I'm sorry.

917
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:30.342
The last thing I ever wanted to
do was put you on the spot.


918
00:54:25.941 --> 00:54:27.243
[phone vibrating]

919
00:54:32.275 --> 00:54:33.441
Hey.

920
00:54:33.443 --> 00:54:35.008
<i>Hey.</i>

921
00:54:36.475 --> 00:54:39.240
I didn't expect to get you.

922
00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:41.840
Right.

923
00:54:41.842 --> 00:54:44.206
I couldn't sleep.

924
00:54:44.208 --> 00:54:46.142
<i>No, neither could I.</i>

925
00:54:53.175 --> 00:54:55.106
All right.

926
00:54:55.108 --> 00:54:56.975
<i>All right what?</i>

927
00:54:58.975 --> 00:55:01.175
I am prepared to do the same.

928
00:55:03.908 --> 00:55:05.340
- Jim...
- <i>What?</i>


929
00:55:05.342 --> 00:55:07.874
Don't say it
if you don't mean it.


930
00:55:07.876 --> 00:55:11.007
<i>Seriously. I'd rather
end it now than...</i>


931
00:55:11.009 --> 00:55:13.174
I don't wanna end it now.

932
00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:15.808
I don't wanna end it ever.

933
00:55:17.209 --> 00:55:19.142
- <i>Are you sure? Because...</i>
- Yes.


934
00:55:25.208 --> 00:55:26.841
Well, neither do I.

935
00:55:28.275 --> 00:55:29.674
Okay.

936
00:55:31.942 --> 00:55:34.406
So are we still gonna
see each other on Thursday?


937
00:55:34.408 --> 00:55:37.240
- Of course.
- <i>And we'll just...</i>


938
00:55:37.242 --> 00:55:41.039
We'll have a proper,
more, you know,


939
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:44.106
practical conversation
about all this,


940
00:55:44.108 --> 00:55:45.774
Okay.

941
00:55:49.242 --> 00:55:50.908
I love you.

942
00:55:55.075 --> 00:55:56.942
I love you too.

943
00:55:59.342 --> 00:56:01.208
See you Thursday.

944
00:56:27.442 --> 00:56:28.973
Hello?

945
00:56:28.975 --> 00:56:31.406
- WOMAN: <i>Mr. Ryan?</i>
- Uh, yes.


946
00:56:31.408 --> 00:56:34.908
This is Ms. Hynes,
Alannah's teacher.


947
00:56:36.408 --> 00:56:38.906
I'm so sorry.
I was at a meeting in town.


948
00:56:38.908 --> 00:56:40.740
- That's all right.
- The thing ran on.


949
00:56:40.742 --> 00:56:42.707
I just forgot
to check the time.


950
00:56:42.709 --> 00:56:44.739
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.


951
00:56:44.741 --> 00:56:46.839
Thanks so much for looking
after them, Ms. Hynes,


952
00:56:46.841 --> 00:56:48.240
I promise this will
never happen again.


953
00:56:48.242 --> 00:56:50.107
I'm sure it won't.

954
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:51.772
Enjoy the rest of your day,
kids.


955
00:56:51.774 --> 00:56:52.906
- Bye.
- Bye.


956
00:56:52.908 --> 00:56:54.243
Thanks.

957
00:56:58.475 --> 00:57:03.073
<i>I look forward to your message.
To end, just hang up.</i>


958
00:57:03.075 --> 00:57:04.973
<i>[beep]</i>

959
00:57:04.975 --> 00:57:09.806
Hey. Uh, me again.

960
00:57:09.808 --> 00:57:13.073
Just checking to see
if everything's okay?


961
00:57:13.075 --> 00:57:14.939
It'd be great
to hear from you,


962
00:57:14.941 --> 00:57:19.906
even if it's just, you know,
a text or whatever.


963
00:57:19.908 --> 00:57:22.075
All right. Bye.

964
00:57:31.008 --> 00:57:32.440
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.


965
00:57:32.442 --> 00:57:35.039
And Stephanie says,
"Would Adam like to come?


966
00:57:35.041 --> 00:57:37.073
- Who's Adam?
- Breda's husband.


967
00:57:37.075 --> 00:57:39.406
And Breda says,
"I see him enough at home.


968
00:57:39.408 --> 00:57:41.939
Do you really think I want
to socialize with him too?"


969
00:57:41.941 --> 00:57:43.772
Completely serious-like.

970
00:57:43.774 --> 00:57:44.774
Cheers.

971
00:57:47.941 --> 00:57:50.006
She says they haven't had sex
in seven years.


972
00:57:50.008 --> 00:57:52.406
Seven? Jesus.

973
00:57:52.408 --> 00:57:53.473
I know.

974
00:57:53.475 --> 00:57:57.306
Which kind of got me thinking.

975
00:57:57.308 --> 00:57:58.708
What's this?

976
00:57:59.942 --> 00:58:02.042
I haven't a clue.

977
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:10.806
It's kinda got you
thinking what?


978
00:58:10.808 --> 00:58:13.474
Well, we could probably do
with keeping a bit of an eye


979
00:58:13.476 --> 00:58:15.340
on our own
relationship lately.


980
00:58:15.342 --> 00:58:17.839
What do you mean?

981
00:58:17.841 --> 00:58:22.073
Well, do you know when we were
last out on a date, for example?


982
00:58:22.075 --> 00:58:23.240
When?

983
00:58:23.242 --> 00:58:25.739
That play we saw.

984
00:58:25.741 --> 00:58:27.206
- Really?
- Yeah,


985
00:58:27.208 --> 00:58:29.107
I mean, that was a couple
of months ago now.


986
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:30.772
Do you know when we
last had sex?


987
00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:33.473
- Um...
- No?


988
00:58:33.475 --> 00:58:35.407
It was that same night.

989
00:58:35.409 --> 00:58:36.841
Okay.

990
00:58:38.208 --> 00:58:40.173
And does that
not bother you?


991
00:58:40.175 --> 00:58:42.839
Yeah,

992
00:58:42.841 --> 00:58:45.807
I haven't seen you,
you know...


993
00:58:45.809 --> 00:58:47.373
instigate anything either.

994
00:58:47.375 --> 00:58:49.940
And I accept that.
God, I'm not blaming you, Jim.


995
00:58:49.942 --> 00:58:52.806
We've both so busy lately,
it's hardly surprising.


996
00:58:52.808 --> 00:58:55.739
I'm just... you know?

997
00:58:55.741 --> 00:58:57.241
I'm just saying,
the flames of our marriage


998
00:58:57.243 --> 00:59:00.140
could do with
a bit of fanning lately.


999
00:59:00.142 --> 00:59:01.839
That's all.

1000
00:59:01.841 --> 00:59:03.275
A bit of fanning?

1001
00:59:04.342 --> 00:59:05.841
Yeah.

1002
00:59:07.375 --> 00:59:09.408
What do you propose?

1003
00:59:15.075 --> 00:59:16.806
[phone ringing]

1004
00:59:16.808 --> 00:59:18.674
What the fuck?

1005
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:25.006
And he said to apologize,
but he just...


1006
00:59:25.008 --> 00:59:27.240
- For not coming up?
- Yeah.


1007
00:59:27.242 --> 00:59:30.406
Oh, God, there's no need,
Yvonne.


1008
00:59:30.408 --> 00:59:34.008
He's just so many people
to tell himself, you know?


1009
00:59:37.108 --> 00:59:39.373
And is there anything
we can do?


1010
00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:42.140
At all?

1011
00:59:42.142 --> 00:59:45.406
I mean, God, you hear about
this kind of thing, but...


1012
00:59:45.408 --> 00:59:46.973
- Don't you?
- Hmm.


1013
00:59:46.975 --> 00:59:49.108
But then it happens and...

1014
00:59:50.908 --> 00:59:53.142
I don't know what to say,
Yvonne.


1015
01:00:07.808 --> 01:00:09.142
And will I...

1016
01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.408
What?

1017
01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:17.142
Will I get to see you?

1018
01:00:19.308 --> 01:00:21.206
Jim...

1019
01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:22.773
No?

1020
01:00:22.775 --> 01:00:25.941
I can't even
think about this anymore.


1021
01:00:29.275 --> 01:00:31.873
I know.

1022
01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:34.273
- He needs me.
- Right.


1023
01:00:34.275 --> 01:00:36.206
- The girls...
- I know. I know.


1024
01:00:36.208 --> 01:00:38.108
They need me.

1025
01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:41.208
And so this is it.

1026
01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:45.242
This is where it has to end.

1027
01:00:51.408 --> 01:00:53.440
And what about after?

1028
01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:55.275
After what?

1029
01:00:57.275 --> 01:00:59.274
Jim...

1030
01:00:59.276 --> 01:01:01.341
- I'm sorry.
- Jim...


1031
01:01:01.343 --> 01:01:03.175
I know. I'm sorry.

1032
01:01:11.108 --> 01:01:13.373
I have to go.

1033
01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:14.909
Okay.

1034
01:01:25.342 --> 01:01:26.908
I'll see you.

1035
01:01:27.975 --> 01:01:29.641
I'll see you.

1036
01:01:40.175 --> 01:01:41.708
[door opens]

1037
01:01:43.941 --> 01:01:44.975
[door closes]

1038
01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.839
- Ten out of ten.
- Uh-huh.


1039
01:01:52.841 --> 01:01:55.006
Aw. It's beautiful, darling.

1040
01:01:55.008 --> 01:01:57.039
- I didn't win though.
- What?


1041
01:01:57.041 --> 01:01:58.406
Joseph Carney got first.

1042
01:01:58.408 --> 01:02:00.373
- And did he get ten out of ten?
- Mm-hmm.


1043
01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:01.873
Well, that's not fair.

1044
01:02:01.875 --> 01:02:03.873
She should have let you
share first place.


1045
01:02:03.875 --> 01:02:06.340
Maybe she was annoyed at you
'cause of having to mind us.


1046
01:02:06.342 --> 01:02:08.039
When did she have to mind you?

1047
01:02:08.041 --> 01:02:10.273
The other day
when Dad was late.


1048
01:02:10.275 --> 01:02:11.873
Picking you up?

1049
01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:13.373
Yeah, I don't know
what the hell happened.


1050
01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:14.739
How late were you?

1051
01:02:14.741 --> 01:02:16.939
- About an hour.
- Ah, Jim.


1052
01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:20.073
I know, I just... I laid down
inside for 15 minutes,


1053
01:02:20.075 --> 01:02:23.006
just to rest my eyes, like,
and when I opened them.


1054
01:02:23.008 --> 01:02:25.873
That's not what you told
Ms. Hynes, Dad.


1055
01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:28.440
- What?
- You told her you were in town.


1056
01:02:28.442 --> 01:02:32.140
- No, I didn't.
- At a meeting. You did.


1057
01:02:32.142 --> 01:02:35.939
Oh, no, you're right.
That's right.


1058
01:02:35.941 --> 01:02:37.906
That's because I was
kind of embarrassed


1059
01:02:37.908 --> 01:02:39.873
about having had a nap
in the first place.


1060
01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:41.306
Why would you be embarrassed?

1061
01:02:41.308 --> 01:02:43.973
I don't know.
In case she thought I was lazy.


1062
01:02:43.975 --> 01:02:45.906
- That's silly.
- So you lied.


1063
01:02:45.908 --> 01:02:47.373
Well, it was a white one
though, wasn't it?


1064
01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:49.240
- Still.
- I know, but...


1065
01:02:49.242 --> 01:02:52.242
- Still, Dad.
- I know, I know. I know.


1066
01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:54.641
[grunts]

1067
01:02:57.142 --> 01:02:58.142
Ready?

1068
01:03:05.774 --> 01:03:07.340
Dad?

1069
01:03:07.342 --> 01:03:09.008
Mam wants you.

1070
01:03:13.742 --> 01:03:15.273
What's up?

1071
01:03:15.275 --> 01:03:18.173
What's your code?

1072
01:03:18.175 --> 01:03:20.206
What code?

1073
01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:21.408
To your phone.

1074
01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:27.039
Why do you wanna know?

1075
01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:29.173
'Cause I need to
make sure of something.


1076
01:03:29.175 --> 01:03:30.939
What?

1077
01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:34.973
That you're not up to something
I think you might be.


1078
01:03:34.975 --> 01:03:36.808
Like what?

1079
01:03:40.075 --> 01:03:42.008
Something like what?

1080
01:03:44.142 --> 01:03:46.973
Like cheating on me.

1081
01:03:46.975 --> 01:03:50.473
- Cheating on you?
- Mm-hmm.


1082
01:03:50.475 --> 01:03:53.140
What the hell are you
talking about?


1083
01:03:53.142 --> 01:03:54.706
Are you?

1084
01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:56.939
Of course not.
What the fuck?


1085
01:03:56.941 --> 01:03:59.008
So what's the code then?

1086
01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.941
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Why not?


1087
01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.839
Because it's private and because
what you're saying is nonsense.


1088
01:04:15.841 --> 01:04:18.373
You really aren't allaying
my suspicions, Jim,


1089
01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:20.073
do you know that?

1090
01:04:20.075 --> 01:04:23.008
Why the hell do you think
I'm cheating on you?


1091
01:04:26.442 --> 01:04:29.039
- I just do.
- You just do?


1092
01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:30.173
That's right.

1093
01:04:30.175 --> 01:04:32.073
Well, I'm not, Danielle.

1094
01:04:32.075 --> 01:04:34.106
So what's in the phone
you don't want me to see then?


1095
01:04:34.108 --> 01:04:35.772
Nothing.

1096
01:04:35.774 --> 01:04:39.106
So why won't you give me
the fucking code then?


1097
01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.772
Why won't you give to me?

1098
01:04:41.774 --> 01:04:44.108
The fuck are you up to, Jim?

1099
01:05:03.908 --> 01:05:05.875
- I was.
- Huh?


1100
01:05:09.308 --> 01:05:12.206
I was seeing someone,
but I'm not anymore.


1101
01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:14.973
This isn't fucking happening.

1102
01:05:14.975 --> 01:05:16.173
Who is she?

1103
01:05:16.175 --> 01:05:18.140
- <i>Was</i> she.
- Huh?


1104
01:05:18.142 --> 01:05:21.375
- I told you, I'm not seeing...
- Jesus, who was she then?


1105
01:05:26.008 --> 01:05:29.739
A girl who works with
a friend of Gary Mulhern.


1106
01:05:29.741 --> 01:05:30.906
You wouldn't know her.

1107
01:05:30.908 --> 01:05:32.808
A younger girl?

1108
01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:39.875
A younger girl.

1109
01:05:41.442 --> 01:05:44.739
You pathetic fuck!

1110
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.240
You're a fucking cliché,
do you know that?


1111
01:05:47.242 --> 01:05:49.107
Jesus Christ.

1112
01:05:52.342 --> 01:05:54.906
And how long were you
seeing her for?


1113
01:05:54.908 --> 01:05:56.839
- Actually, no.
- A few weeks.


1114
01:05:56.841 --> 01:05:59.039
You know what?
I don't wanna know.


1115
01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:01.340
I want you to just
get what you need and to go.


1116
01:06:01.342 --> 01:06:03.739
- Danielle...
- Now, please!


1117
01:06:03.741 --> 01:06:05.806
[sighs]

1118
01:06:05.808 --> 01:06:07.872
Where am I supposed to go?

1119
01:06:07.874 --> 01:06:10.406
What the fuck do I care?
To her!


1120
01:06:10.408 --> 01:06:12.240
- To her?
- To hell!


1121
01:06:12.242 --> 01:06:14.939
Who gives a fuck,
as long as it's out of here!


1122
01:06:14.941 --> 01:06:16.875
As long as I don't have to...

1123
01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:21.941
to fucking look at you!

1124
01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:33.108
[Danielle sobbing]

1125
01:06:57.175 --> 01:07:00.106
This is when they
contradicted him. Okay.


1126
01:07:00.108 --> 01:07:03.206
There was the briefest moment of
panic in his face, and I just...


1127
01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:05.406
- My heart stopped beating.
- 'Cause you knew.


1128
01:07:05.408 --> 01:07:06.873
'Cause I fucking knew,
you know?


1129
01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:08.341
Wow.

1130
01:07:10.308 --> 01:07:12.006
And you're actually gonna
go through with it?


1131
01:07:12.008 --> 01:07:15.006
Yeah, well...
What do you mean?


1132
01:07:15.008 --> 01:07:17.973
Well, you're not just,
I don't know, punishing him.


1133
01:07:17.975 --> 01:07:19.805
No. God, no.

1134
01:07:19.807 --> 01:07:23.173
- [phone vibrating]
- It's over, Yvonne. I mean...


1135
01:07:23.175 --> 01:07:25.140
Do you need to get that?

1136
01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:26.308
Oh.

1137
01:07:31.041 --> 01:07:33.706
- No, it's fine, go on.
- We're finished.


1138
01:07:33.708 --> 01:07:35.173
Okay.

1139
01:07:35.175 --> 01:07:37.206
I think even
he understands that now.


1140
01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:39.706
And who was she?

1141
01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:43.340
I don't know. Some woman that
works with a friend of his.


1142
01:07:43.342 --> 01:07:45.173
- A younger model, of course.
- Oh, no.


1143
01:07:45.175 --> 01:07:46.806
So fucking predictable.

1144
01:07:46.808 --> 01:07:48.306
- How much younger?
- I didn't ask.


1145
01:07:48.308 --> 01:07:49.973
- Really?
- No.


1146
01:07:49.975 --> 01:07:51.939
Well, the fact of it
hurts enough


1147
01:07:51.941 --> 01:07:53.906
without having to know
those fucking details.


1148
01:07:53.908 --> 01:07:55.406
- How firm were her breasts.
- Right.


1149
01:07:55.408 --> 01:07:57.006
What kind of contortions
was she capable of.


1150
01:07:57.008 --> 01:07:59.273
Fuck that.

1151
01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.308
I'm past it, Yvonne.

1152
01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:04.873
Why? Would you?

1153
01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:07.108
- Want to know?
- Yeah.


1154
01:08:08.807 --> 01:08:10.874
No, probably not.

1155
01:08:15.408 --> 01:08:16.641
What?

1156
01:08:18.174 --> 01:08:20.739
We're both gonna be alone.

1157
01:08:20.741 --> 01:08:23.806
- Oh, God, I'm sorry, Yvonne.
- What?


1158
01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:25.406
As if my problems are anything
compared to yours.


1159
01:08:25.408 --> 01:08:27.841
- Stop.
- No, but it's true.


1160
01:08:29.408 --> 01:08:31.273
How is he?

1161
01:08:31.275 --> 01:08:34.039
He's coping.

1162
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:35.938
And how are you doing?

1163
01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:39.006
Yeah, for the moment,
I am too.


1164
01:08:39.008 --> 01:08:41.006
I mean, at this point,
it's just about


1165
01:08:41.008 --> 01:08:45.041
squeezing the last few drops out
of the little time we've left.


1166
01:08:48.075 --> 01:08:50.039
You wanna say hello?

1167
01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:52.173
Okay.

1168
01:08:52.175 --> 01:08:54.073
Here, try that wee one.

1169
01:08:54.075 --> 01:08:56.839
Is it going in?

1170
01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.806
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you?


1171
01:08:58.808 --> 01:09:01.373
- Okay. How are you?
- Yeah, good, thanks.


1172
01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:04.072
- We'll see.
- That's good.


1173
01:09:04.074 --> 01:09:05.206
Just doing a bit of gardening.

1174
01:09:05.208 --> 01:09:08.006
Hey, girls, how are you doing?

1175
01:09:08.008 --> 01:09:10.373
JIM: <i>Hey, um...</i>

1176
01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:14.273
<i>I just wanna say
I hope Chris is doing okay.</i>


1177
01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:17.006
<i>I mean, given the...</i>

1178
01:09:17.008 --> 01:09:21.240
<i>Anyway, I know I'm being
a bit, um, persistent,</i>


1179
01:09:21.242 --> 01:09:25.106
<i>but I'd love to talk at some
point, if you get a minute.</i>


1180
01:09:25.108 --> 01:09:27.706
<i>I can meet you anywhere
for however long</i>


1181
01:09:27.708 --> 01:09:29.708
<i>at whatever time.</i>

1182
01:09:34.242 --> 01:09:35.741
<i>I miss you.</i>

1183
01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.273
You know Karen.
She'd be going on about,


1184
01:09:42.275 --> 01:09:45.006
"Did I make the right decision
not having kids?"


1185
01:09:45.008 --> 01:09:46.973
With having had the girls
this last few weeks,


1186
01:09:46.975 --> 01:09:52.073
I'd say she feels... not that
they haven't been well-behaved...


1187
01:09:52.075 --> 01:09:54.473
but that she probably
made the right decision.


1188
01:09:54.475 --> 01:09:56.406
[Chris laughs]

1189
01:09:56.408 --> 01:09:59.173
Hmm.

1190
01:09:59.175 --> 01:10:01.142
She doesn't know
what she's missing, does she?


1191
01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:16.340
Did you ever cheat on me, Chris?

1192
01:10:16.342 --> 01:10:18.440
What?

1193
01:10:18.442 --> 01:10:19.941
Did you?

1194
01:10:27.208 --> 01:10:28.741
I kissed someone once.

1195
01:10:30.208 --> 01:10:31.308
Who?

1196
01:10:34.242 --> 01:10:36.108
Laura McCabe.

1197
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.806
That time you were
in Birmingham?


1198
01:10:40.808 --> 01:10:42.040
Yeah.

1199
01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:46.908
Okay.

1200
01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:51.472
I almost went to her room
with her too.


1201
01:10:51.474 --> 01:10:53.142
But you didn't.

1202
01:10:54.808 --> 01:10:56.073
No.

1203
01:10:56.075 --> 01:10:57.641
Why not?

1204
01:11:00.041 --> 01:11:02.108
Came to my senses.

1205
01:11:05.975 --> 01:11:08.039
I'm sorry, Yvonne.

1206
01:11:08.041 --> 01:11:09.373
That's okay.

1207
01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:11.008
It's not.

1208
01:11:13.307 --> 01:11:18.041
I even bought fucking condoms
in the toilets.


1209
01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:25.073
- Will you forgive me?
- What about other times?


1210
01:11:25.075 --> 01:11:26.609
There were none.

1211
01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:32.074
Will you forgive me?

1212
01:11:33.841 --> 01:11:35.207
Yes.

1213
01:11:38.741 --> 01:11:40.175
Thank you.

1214
01:11:44.275 --> 01:11:45.806
I'm glad you asked.

1215
01:11:45.808 --> 01:11:47.173
- You're glad?
- Yeah.


1216
01:11:47.175 --> 01:11:49.240
Why?

1217
01:11:49.242 --> 01:11:51.772
I suppose it matters,
all of a sudden,


1218
01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.772
how you remember me.

1219
01:11:53.774 --> 01:11:58.440
Not that you'll
think well of me.


1220
01:11:58.442 --> 01:12:02.006
You'll think what you want,
I suppose,


1221
01:12:02.008 --> 01:12:04.405
but that you have no...

1222
01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:07.373
questions about to who I was.

1223
01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:08.739
Uh-huh.

1224
01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:11.473
Or what I thought or felt.

1225
01:12:11.475 --> 01:12:12.738
Okay.

1226
01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.275
Deep down.

1227
01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:28.674
It's weird, you know.
I don't fell bitter at all.


1228
01:12:29.774 --> 01:12:31.140
What do you mean?

1229
01:12:31.142 --> 01:12:32.108
About this.

1230
01:12:34.408 --> 01:12:36.406
There are people...
Jesus...


1231
01:12:36.408 --> 01:12:39.406
children who don't
even get to grow up.


1232
01:12:39.408 --> 01:12:41.440
Kids I went to school with

1233
01:12:41.442 --> 01:12:43.939
who never made it
out of their teens.


1234
01:12:43.941 --> 01:12:48.239
You know, why did I deserve
more life than them?


1235
01:12:48.241 --> 01:12:49.841
I didn't.

1236
01:12:51.407 --> 01:12:53.008
I don't.

1237
01:12:55.741 --> 01:13:00.973
And these last however many
years with you, Yvonne,


1238
01:13:00.975 --> 01:13:02.874
and the girls...

1239
01:13:04.342 --> 01:13:08.242
this whole adventure we've had,
I fuck...


1240
01:13:13.975 --> 01:13:18.373
I really loved it all,
you know?


1241
01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:21.240
So, no, I don't feel cheated

1242
01:13:21.242 --> 01:13:25.641
because I really believe
I've had a generous share.


1243
01:13:29.108 --> 01:13:31.373
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


1244
01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:33.306
Yes.

1245
01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:35.808
Of life, like.

1246
01:13:37.207 --> 01:13:40.073
A generous share.

1247
01:13:40.075 --> 01:13:41.741
And more.

1248
01:13:46.242 --> 01:13:47.705
Don't cry.

1249
01:13:47.707 --> 01:13:48.738
[chuckles]

1250
01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:50.173
[sniffles]

1251
01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:51.406
[Chris chuckles]

1252
01:13:51.408 --> 01:13:53.275
I can't help it.

1253
01:14:12.242 --> 01:14:13.873
- Give it to me.
- In a minute.


1254
01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:15.006
- Now!
- I'm using it.


1255
01:14:15.008 --> 01:14:16.706
- I don't care.
- Mam.


1256
01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:18.006
- Give me it.
- Mam!


1257
01:14:18.008 --> 01:14:20.208
Will you give her
the bloody thing?


1258
01:14:22.141 --> 01:14:23.774
[doorbell rings]

1259
01:14:31.108 --> 01:14:32.439
Here.

1260
01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:36.275
No, go on.
Just hurry up.


1261
01:14:38.108 --> 01:14:39.175
Hey.

1262
01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.306
Hey.

1263
01:14:41.308 --> 01:14:43.373
Long time no see.

1264
01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:44.839
Jim...

1265
01:14:44.841 --> 01:14:46.975
Can I talk to you
just for a minute?


1266
01:14:51.342 --> 01:14:53.339
You'll have to do it here.
The girls are inside.


1267
01:14:53.341 --> 01:14:56.973
Okay. I'm sorry about
the phone calls, I am.


1268
01:14:56.975 --> 01:14:59.306
I just... There's something
I need to know.


1269
01:14:59.308 --> 01:15:01.240
What?

1270
01:15:01.242 --> 01:15:03.740
That you're gonna
come back to me.


1271
01:15:07.708 --> 01:15:11.038
Do you any idea
what I'm going through, Jim?


1272
01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.440
- I do.
- You don't.


1273
01:15:12.442 --> 01:15:14.440
I'm barely holding on
to my sanity,


1274
01:15:14.442 --> 01:15:16.140
- and you're demanding to know...
- I am.


1275
01:15:16.142 --> 01:15:17.806
If you're gonna be with me
after he's gone.


1276
01:15:17.808 --> 01:15:19.839
- After he's gone?
- Yes!


1277
01:15:19.841 --> 01:15:21.973
Do you have any idea how fucking
insensitive you're being?


1278
01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:23.340
- Yvonne...
- How selfish?


1279
01:15:23.342 --> 01:15:24.973
- I love you.
- Right.


1280
01:15:24.975 --> 01:15:27.805
I do, and...
What the hell does that mean?


1281
01:15:27.807 --> 01:15:29.039
- What does what mean?
- "Right".


1282
01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:30.340
- It means "I see."
- You see?


1283
01:15:30.342 --> 01:15:32.140
That's right!

1284
01:15:32.142 --> 01:15:33.806
You say that as if
it's something you didn't know.


1285
01:15:33.808 --> 01:15:35.473
Let me ask you something.

1286
01:15:35.475 --> 01:15:37.006
That first time
we slept together,


1287
01:15:37.008 --> 01:15:38.406
did you know
my husband was dying?


1288
01:15:38.408 --> 01:15:40.006
What? No.

1289
01:15:40.008 --> 01:15:42.008
You did, Jim!

1290
01:15:44.374 --> 01:15:46.406
What the fu...
You seduced me, Yvonne.


1291
01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.306
You're the one
who came on to me.


1292
01:15:48.308 --> 01:15:51.273
Out of... Yes, yes!
Out of loneliness!


1293
01:15:51.275 --> 01:15:53.273
Confusion about my husband,
about his behavior,


1294
01:15:53.275 --> 01:15:54.838
which would have been
less confusing


1295
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.240
had I have known
what you knew.


1296
01:15:56.242 --> 01:15:57.873
- I promised him.
- What?


1297
01:15:57.875 --> 01:15:59.072
I promised
I wouldn't tell you.


1298
01:15:59.074 --> 01:16:00.373
You didn't have to fuck me.

1299
01:16:00.375 --> 01:16:01.873
You didn't have
to beg me to fuck you.

Mam?

1301

- Yes?
- Can we watch TV?

Clean up your
drawing stuff first.


1303
01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:13.906
Did you never think about
what'd happen once I found out?


1304
01:16:13.908 --> 01:16:15.073
- I don't know.
- You don't know?


1305
01:16:15.075 --> 01:16:16.306
No, I didn't!

1306
01:16:16.308 --> 01:16:17.973
- What did you think about?
- You!


1307

- Me.
- Yes!


1308
01:16:19.442 --> 01:16:21.739
And of how fucking amazing
it was to be with you.


1309
01:16:21.741 --> 01:16:25.406
Jim, it's a terrible thing
you did.


1310
01:16:25.408 --> 01:16:27.939
Do you even realize that?

1311
01:16:27.941 --> 01:16:30.806
And what about you, huh?

1312
01:16:30.808 --> 01:16:32.273
- You told me you loved me.
- Yes.


1313
01:16:32.275 --> 01:16:34.140
- You wanted us to be together.
- Yes, I did.


1314
01:16:34.142 --> 01:16:36.772
To destroy our fucking families.
Does he know that?


1315
01:16:36.774 --> 01:16:39.173
- Mam, Isabelle's making me...

Go inside, love.

Please go away and
leave us alone, will you, Jim?

- Mam!


1319
01:16:50.442 --> 01:16:52.440
- This is my family, Jim.
- I wanted to be...

Two gin and slimline tonics and
a vodka and Diet Coke, please.

Look, we're back
to the same fucking thing.

I accept that
it wasn't your fault.

- You accept it, do you?
- Yeah.


1335

- Why did you say it was?
- I didn't.

All I did was point out that
the fucking chips never came.

Why is that my responsibility?

01:17:47.275 --> 01:17:48.739
- It's not.
- Exactly.


1339
01:17:48.741 --> 01:17:50.140
But you have
other responsibilities.

were you there for?

- Yeah.

- Fuck you.

The customer is always right.

1427
01:22:14.374 --> 01:22:16.708
A guy I know died.

1428
01:22:19.175 --> 01:22:21.108
Was he a friend of yours?

1429
01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:28.142
- I have to go.
- Okay.


1430
01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:44.373
We had a good time,
didn't we?


1431
01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:46.140
Yeah.

1432
01:22:46.142 --> 01:22:48.140
Well, I did.

1433
01:22:48.142 --> 01:22:49.740
Yeah, no, so did I.

1434
01:22:52.175 --> 01:22:56.706
So do you wanna
get together again maybe?


1435
01:22:56.708 --> 01:22:59.906
Yeah, I don't know.

I, um...

Was what we did not just like
a one-night thing?


1439
01:23:06.708 --> 01:23:09.106
Oh, is that what it was?

1440
01:23:09.108 --> 01:23:12.273
- Well, it...
- No, that's fine.


1441
01:23:12.275 --> 01:23:13.738
That's fine.
I'll see you around.


1442

Don't be like that.

Go on.

1445
01:23:20.308 --> 01:23:22.739
- Fair enough.
- Fucking asshole.


1446
01:23:22.741 --> 01:23:25.139
It was nice having
your miserable,

I mean, you know that.

1453
01:23:46.408 --> 01:23:48.772
I mean, even as kids,
I remember


1454
01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:52.272
because you'd expect the case
to be the reverse,


1455
01:23:52.274 --> 01:23:56.306
particularly with kids,
but no.


1456
01:23:56.308 --> 01:23:59.073
I remember one time
our cousins came over,


1457
01:23:59.075 --> 01:24:01.340
- Patsy and Pudge.
- Okay.


1458
01:24:01.342 --> 01:24:04.140
And Patsy was really upset...

1459
01:24:04.142 --> 01:24:05.972
How are you? My God.

1460
01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.739
Good. It's so nice
to see you.


1461
01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:10.105
This is Robert.

1462
01:24:10.107 --> 01:24:12.172
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.


1463
01:24:12.174 --> 01:24:14.172
- So, you and Jim...
- That's right.


1464
01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.839
- I see.
- That's okay.


1465
01:24:15.841 --> 01:24:18.006
Just one of those things
we have to explain to people


1466
01:24:18.008 --> 01:24:19.407
every once in a while.

1467
01:24:22.208 --> 01:24:24.373
You know me and Lisa broke up.

1468
01:24:24.375 --> 01:24:27.039
Oh, that's right.

1469
01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:29.342
That was a while ago now
though, wasn't it?


1470
01:24:32.074 --> 01:24:33.741
Still, though...

1471
01:24:37.475 --> 01:24:39.139
- Isabelle.
- Yeah?


1472
01:24:39.141 --> 01:24:40.739
- Be careful.
- Okay.


1473
01:24:40.741 --> 01:24:42.839
And watch your sister.
Where is she?


1474
01:24:42.841 --> 01:24:45.039
Sophie...

1475
01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:46.406
Be careful.

1476
01:24:46.408 --> 01:24:48.839
Okay!

1477
01:24:48.841 --> 01:24:50.838
Sorry, Joan.

1478
01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.440
We just kind of knew each other
just from around the building.


1479
01:24:53.442 --> 01:24:55.106
We'd not talked, really, but...

1480
01:24:55.108 --> 01:24:57.739
So it was more a mutual
admiration type of thing.


1481
01:24:57.741 --> 01:25:01.373
Not exactly, but I can't deny
I found him handsome.


1482
01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:03.873
- And what about you, Robert?
- What?


1483
01:25:03.875 --> 01:25:05.706
- You think she was gorgeous?
- Martina.


1484
01:25:05.708 --> 01:25:08.206
Well, you are bloody gorgeous,
Danielle.


1485
01:25:08.208 --> 01:25:09.739
Did you?

1486
01:25:09.741 --> 01:25:12.373
You don't want to move on,
of course,


1487
01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:15.173
but what the hell choice
do you have, you know?


1488
01:25:15.175 --> 01:25:16.872
And then one day, you're like,

1489
01:25:16.874 --> 01:25:19.406
"What the fuck
was all the anger about?"


1490
01:25:19.408 --> 01:25:22.440
You know, the fucking rage
or whatever.


1491
01:25:22.442 --> 01:25:24.806
Dad, can we talk to you
for a minute?


1492
01:25:24.808 --> 01:25:26.875
- Yeah.
- Outside?


1493
01:25:36.242 --> 01:25:37.373
Sit here.

1494
01:25:37.375 --> 01:25:38.807
Okay.

1495
01:25:42.041 --> 01:25:45.440
Okay. We have a problem.

1496
01:25:45.442 --> 01:25:46.772
Uh-huh.

1497
01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:48.272
Mam has a boyfriend.

1498
01:25:48.274 --> 01:25:51.008
- Right. Robert.
- Right.


1499
01:25:53.108 --> 01:25:54.806
Is he nice?

1500
01:25:54.808 --> 01:25:57.906
Well, that's the problem,
you see.


1501
01:25:57.908 --> 01:26:00.240
- He isn't?
- He is.


1502
01:26:00.242 --> 01:26:03.306
He is, and we like him
an awful lot,


1503
01:26:03.308 --> 01:26:07.872
but that kind of makes us sad.

1504
01:26:07.874 --> 01:26:09.972
Doesn't it?

1505
01:26:09.974 --> 01:26:13.038
Because you're our dad,
you see,


1506
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.006
and it feels like,
if he's your enemy,


1507
01:26:17.008 --> 01:26:20.142
then it's like
we're betraying you.


1508
01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:24.039
But he's not my enemy.

1509
01:26:24.041 --> 01:26:25.275
No?

1510
01:26:29.075 --> 01:26:31.805
Does he make your mam happy?

1511
01:26:31.807 --> 01:26:33.706
Yes.

1512
01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:35.406
And you like him.

1513
01:26:35.408 --> 01:26:37.440
- He's so kind.
- And funny.


1514
01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:38.641
And funny.

1515
01:26:40.274 --> 01:26:43.207
Well, then that makes me happy.

1516
01:26:44.341 --> 01:26:46.073
Are you sure?

1517
01:26:46.075 --> 01:26:48.242
Because you kind of look like
you're gonna cry.


1518
01:26:51.142 --> 01:26:54.273
I thought of poor Chris,
suddenly.


1519
01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:55.674
That's all.

1520
01:27:04.141 --> 01:27:05.841
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, son.


1521
01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:10.008
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, love.


1522
01:27:19.275 --> 01:27:22.005
- I remember when Mam was dying.
- Right.


1523
01:27:22.007 --> 01:27:23.972
She was talking about
the things we did as kids


1524
01:27:23.974 --> 01:27:25.706
that meant the most to her,

1525
01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:29.239
and she said
the mornings he'd wake her


1526
01:27:29.241 --> 01:27:32.772
by blowing softly
on her eyelids.


1527
01:27:32.774 --> 01:27:36.405
I mean, he was only two
or three at the time,


1528
01:27:36.407 --> 01:27:41.838
but she said to be woken
in such a lovely, gentle way...


1529
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.771
That's okay.

1530
01:27:43.773 --> 01:27:48.206
And to see his little face
smiling down at her, she just...


1531
01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:51.272
- That's okay.
- She...


1532

When we get ourselves fixed up,

we'll go home and we'll just be

is the worst.

- But Stephanie said...
- It is the worst.

- No, it's not.
- No, it's not

01:29:12.875 --> 01:29:14.973
because Stephanie said that
because it's the rarest...

1580
01:30:18.774 --> 01:30:20.908
than I think is appropriate.

Yeah, and a glass of whatever

Hi.

1585
01:31:21.008 --> 01:31:23.771
- And where do you live now?
- Rathmines.


1586
01:31:23.773 --> 01:31:25.206
Right.

- Yeah.

so, you know,

there's still a lot of
unpacking, etcetera.


1591
01:31:32.908 --> 01:31:36.339
- Right.
- There's settling in to be done.


1592
01:31:36.341 --> 01:31:39.073
And are you still in...
What is it?


1593
01:31:39.075 --> 01:31:40.739
Brophy's. I am.

1594
01:31:40.741 --> 01:31:42.439
Though I'm back
to full-time now.


1595
01:31:42.441 --> 01:31:45.106
The necessity of being
a single parent.


1596
01:31:45.108 --> 01:31:47.905
At least you don't have as far
to commute anymore.


1597
01:31:47.907 --> 01:31:52.306
That's true. Well, that's mainly
the reason we moved out there.


1598
01:31:52.308 --> 01:31:55.005
- How are the girls?
- They're well.


1599
01:31:55.007 --> 01:31:58.205
They're well.
They miss their dad.


1600
01:31:58.207 --> 01:31:59.806
Right.

1601
01:31:59.808 --> 01:32:02.806

Or shouldn't I ask?


1602

It's fine. They're fine.

1603
01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:09.771
I get to see them every
second weekend, which is...


1604
01:32:09.773 --> 01:32:12.273
better than not at all,
I suppose.


1605
01:32:12.275 --> 01:32:17.038
Danielle and I
remain polite to each other,


1606
01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.706

1607
01:32:18.708 --> 01:32:21.473
And is she still with that guy?

1608
01:32:21.475 --> 01:32:23.939
- You don't ever see her?
- Not really, no.


1609
01:32:23.941 --> 01:32:25.405
Robert.

1610
01:32:25.407 --> 01:32:29.006
She is. He's okay.

1611
01:32:29.008 --> 01:32:30.939
They're in Blackrock.
Really big house out there,


1612
01:32:30.941 --> 01:32:33.140
so she didn't do too badly
for herself.


1613
01:32:33.142 --> 01:32:36.705
Not that that kind of stuff
was ever important to her


1614
01:32:36.707 --> 01:32:40.240
in any case, but still...

1615
01:32:40.242 --> 01:32:42.872
Go there to pick up the kids.
I feel like a tramp.


1616
01:32:42.874 --> 01:32:47.072
- Do you?
- Sometimes, yeah, a little bit.


1617
01:32:47.074 --> 01:32:50.741
But I can't say he isn't...
he isn't crazy about them.


1618
01:32:54.808 --> 01:32:57.805
I sometimes kind of think
she knows it was me.


1619
01:32:57.807 --> 01:33:00.106
- Danielle?
- Mm-hmm.


1620
01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:02.805
- Really?
- Or suspects.


1621

I don't know.

1622

She just...

1623
01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:09.873
I felt she really withdrew
from me after the funeral.


1624
01:33:09.875 --> 01:33:13.706
- Right.
- Like consciously, you know?


1625
01:33:13.708 --> 01:33:16.439
She never said anything
to you, did she?


1626
01:33:16.441 --> 01:33:18.738
No, well,
that particular subject


1627
01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:21.242
wouldn't come up
in any case, you know?


1628
01:33:32.375 --> 01:33:34.372
Are you seeing anyone
these days?


1629
01:33:34.374 --> 01:33:36.105
No.

1630
01:33:36.107 --> 01:33:39.472
Well, actually, I went out
with a guy quite recently.


1631
01:33:39.474 --> 01:33:40.839
Right.

1632

"went out with,"

1634

Why? What happened?

1635
01:33:48.008 --> 01:33:49.640

You understand why I had to do
what I had to do, Jim.

Yes, I mean,
what else could you do?
