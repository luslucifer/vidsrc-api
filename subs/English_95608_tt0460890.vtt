00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:43.388
<i>In the 20th century,</i>

2
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.957
<i>if you wanted</i>
<i>to know your neighbors,</i>


3
00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:46.758
<i>you moved to the suburbs.</i>

4
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.827
<i>If you wanted</i>
<i>to become an addict,</i>


5
00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.696
<i>you moved to New York.</i>

6
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.967
<i>The junkies are in the burbs,</i>

7
00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.804
<i>and the building next door</i>
<i>is a fucking kickball league.</i>


8
00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.774
<i>It was art against commerce,</i>
<i>and commerce won.</i>


9
00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:05.944
<i>The kids think the only place</i>
<i>to find art is in a gallery</i>


10
00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:07.713
<i>and the only place</i>
<i>to find romance</i>


11
00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:10.449
<i>is confessing your love</i>
<i>in the rain,</i>


12
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:11.917
<i>like in the movies.</i>

13
00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:13.919
<i>But it's messier than that.</i>

14
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:17.656
<i>Well, there's always mess.</i>

15
00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:21.326
<i>It's safe here now,</i>
<i>but there's still urban decay.</i>


16
00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:23.929
<i>It's just migrated</i>
<i>into the dinner parties</i>


17
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:26.398
<i>of the upper West Side.</i>

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.667
<i>The best lack all conviction,</i>

19
00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:32.437
<i>while the worst are filled</i>
<i>with passionate intensity.</i>


20
00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.307
<i>Yeats said that,</i>
<i>but so did Lou Reed,</i>


21
00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:38.844
<i>quoting him live</i>
<i>at the bottom line.</i>


22
00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:42.648
<i>Lou Reed's gone,</i>
<i>and so is the bottom line.</i>


23
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.350
<i>It's probably a soul cycle--</i>

24
00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:49.054
<i>the only soul</i>
<i>the city has left.</i>


25
00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:51.957
<i>Everyone's pretending</i>
<i>it's all okay,</i>


26
00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.925
<i>but that's a lie.</i>

27
00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:56.662
<i>Something's missing,</i>
<i>and we all feel it.</i>


28
00:01:56.664 --> 00:01:59.531
<i>Including Thomas Webb.</i>

29
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:03.468
<i>He thought he had the answer</i>
<i>and her name was Mimi.</i>


30
00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:10.409
1976. The city was
dirty, crime-ridden and broke.


31
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:13.478
It was the center
of the creative universe.


32
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.380
New York's lost its soul.

33
00:02:15.382 --> 00:02:18.517
The most vibrant neighborhood
at the moment is Philadelphia.


34
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.020
I like that.

35
00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:23.422
-Yeah?
-Yeah.


36
00:02:23.424 --> 00:02:24.790
Where'd you lift that from?

37
00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:26.525
I didn't. It's mine.

38
00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:28.727
Well, it's good.

39
00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.397
So, will you come
with me tonight?


40
00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.767
No. Your mom's last dinner
party made me feel invisible.


41
00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.337
I know, but we were
invisible together.


42
00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.706
If you don't like it,
then you don't go.


43
00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:42.908
I have to go.
My mother's unstable.


44
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.943
Throwing dinner parties
is how she medicates.


45
00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:47.012
Yeah, so what about
the lithium and Xanax?


46
00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:50.716
Not to mention
the nicotine and Shiraz.


47
00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:52.651
Semantics.

48
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:57.456
I have to tell you something.

49
00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.391
-Yeah?
-Yeah.


50
00:02:59.393 --> 00:03:01.827
I...

51
00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.797
Might be going to Zagreb.

52
00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.033
-Where?
-Zagreb.


53
00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:09.935
It's in Croatia.

54
00:03:09.937 --> 00:03:12.938
So, Helmut Graph,
he runs a workshop there,


55
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.475
and I found out that I can
transfer my credits to NYU.


56
00:03:16.477 --> 00:03:19.077
That's, um...

57
00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.780
That's...

58
00:03:21.782 --> 00:03:23.815
Terrible.

59
00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:26.752
Why?

60
00:03:26.754 --> 00:03:28.854
No, why is that terrible?

61
00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:31.156
Because you're the only thing
in my life that I'm settled on.


62
00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:33.592
Thomas, what do you think
is happening?


63
00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:35.827
Between me and you,
what do you think this is?


64
00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.897
August 8. August 8.
I think August 8 was real.


65
00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:40.999
It was amazing.

66
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:43.535
But it was just one night.

67
00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:45.937
I mean, Nick was playing L.A.

68
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.606
I was vulnerable.

69
00:03:47.608 --> 00:03:50.041
We were both on Molly.

70
00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:51.910
I
-I thought I was a pirate.

71
00:03:55.648 --> 00:03:58.150
And it was just one night.

72
00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:00.886
Well, I'm crazy about you.

73
00:04:00.888 --> 00:04:03.622
-I'm crazy about you, but...
-But don't say "as friends."


74
00:04:03.624 --> 00:04:06.158
Why? Why is that so bad?

75
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.959
Because pretty girls like
to recruit their rejections


76
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:09.127
and then call them friends.

77
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:14.199
Wow.

78
00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:42.894
<i>For Mimi, Thomas was like</i>
<i>the new New York--</i>


79
00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:45.764
<i>no danger, no deliverance.</i>

80
00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:47.532
<i>It made him nurturing</i>

81
00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:50.836
<i>and too boring</i>
<i>to fall in love with.</i>


82
00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:54.506
<i>Mimi thought Thomas</i>
<i>was a boy without mystery.</i>


83
00:04:54.508 --> 00:04:56.141
<i>Thomas agreed.</i>

84
00:04:56.143 --> 00:04:59.144
<i>But all that</i>
<i>was about to change.</i>


85
00:05:22.668 --> 00:05:24.669
Anything worth opening?

86
00:05:26.672 --> 00:05:28.673
Just bills and junk.

87
00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:33.211
W.F.

88
00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:35.013
W.F. Gerald.

89
00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:37.883
I just moved into 2
-B.

90
00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:40.719
Thomas Webb.

91
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.954
Why so troubled, Thomas?

92
00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:44.222
Excuse me?

93
00:05:44.224 --> 00:05:46.791
I know that color of stress.

94
00:05:46.793 --> 00:05:48.693
It's much brighter
than job issues,


95
00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:52.297
more subdued
than possible disease.


96
00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:53.665
Ah.

97
00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:55.667
Sorry, I'm being rude.

98
00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.236
No, I mean...

99
00:05:58.238 --> 00:05:59.905
I'm having a bad day.

100
00:05:59.907 --> 00:06:01.773
Oh.

101
00:06:01.775 --> 00:06:03.775
What's her name?

102
00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:08.213
It's Mimi.

103
00:06:08.215 --> 00:06:09.648
Ah, Mimi.

104
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.583
Derived from Williamina.

105
00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:13.818
It means "resolute protector."

106
00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.022
There you go.

107
00:06:17.024 --> 00:06:19.824
What, uh...

108
00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:22.160
What is it that you like
about this Mimi?


109
00:06:22.162 --> 00:06:24.596
You a psychiatrist?

110
00:06:24.598 --> 00:06:25.997
No.

111
00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:27.899
You ask psychiatrist questions.

112
00:06:27.901 --> 00:06:29.668
Maybe I can help.

113
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.938
Maybe I can help you
get Mimi to sleep with you.


114
00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:37.275
How do you know
she hasn't already?


115
00:06:50.122 --> 00:06:51.790
It's nice meeting you.

116
00:06:51.792 --> 00:06:54.292
Yeah.

117
00:06:54.294 --> 00:06:59.664
Well, why don't you let a new
neighbor help you out, hmm?


118
00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:03.368
What do you like about Mimi?

119
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.907
I'm in 2
-B!

120
00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:43.908
<i>Where did you meet her?</i>

121
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.113
There's this bookstore
called the Pale Fire.


122
00:07:48.115 --> 00:07:49.981
-Yeah.
-It's named after John Sh...


123
00:07:49.983 --> 00:07:53.351
John Shade's 999-line poem.

124
00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:55.687
Nabokov.

125
00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:58.690
Right. Well... they sell
rare vintage books in there,


126
00:07:58.692 --> 00:08:00.825
and I'm into that, just
reading off the beaten path,


127
00:08:00.827 --> 00:08:02.694
and Mimi works there.

128
00:08:02.696 --> 00:08:05.263
She gave me
the greatest recommendations.


129
00:08:05.265 --> 00:08:07.132
You know?

130
00:08:07.134 --> 00:08:09.134
She's putting herself
through NYU's writing program.


131
00:08:09.136 --> 00:08:10.935
She reads a book a week.
She's...


132
00:08:10.937 --> 00:08:12.937
Polishing her brain.

133
00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:14.439
Huh.

134
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:17.142
Beautiful?

135
00:08:17.144 --> 00:08:19.911
- Incredibly beautiful.

136
00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:22.714
-Like she's direct from god,
you know? -Mm.


137
00:08:22.716 --> 00:08:24.683
Not second generation,
if that makes sense.


138
00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:26.985
Complete sense.

139
00:08:26.987 --> 00:08:30.455
You know, we get each other.

140
00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:33.792
Problem was--

141
00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:37.796
is-- that she has
this boyfriend.


142
00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:41.733
Nick, and he's in that band,
Fahrenheit 185.


143
00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:44.736
The exact temperature it takes
to cook heroin.


144
00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:48.973
Properly.

145
00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:54.212
Eh, let's see what we got.

146
00:08:59.785 --> 00:09:02.120
-
-Yeah.

147
00:09:03.723 --> 00:09:07.859
Anyway, so, Nick goes on tour.

148
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:11.863
Mimi's now available, and
we're hanging out more, and...


149
00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:14.199
We end up spending...

150
00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:16.134
A magical night together.

151
00:09:16.136 --> 00:09:19.104
-Mm.
-August 8.


152
00:09:19.106 --> 00:09:23.074
And then... nothing.

153
00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:25.243
All goes platonic.

154
00:09:25.245 --> 00:09:27.846
How old is Mimi?

155
00:09:27.848 --> 00:09:30.782
She's... 22.
She just turned 22.


156
00:09:30.784 --> 00:09:33.017
She's young, you know?

157
00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:38.022
She's at an age where defense
mechanisms are very strong.


158
00:09:38.024 --> 00:09:41.526
Despite her outer veneer,
she's ruled by fear.


159
00:09:41.528 --> 00:09:44.829
Like so many of us
at that time, you know.


160
00:09:44.831 --> 00:09:46.765
What you need to do,

161
00:09:46.767 --> 00:09:50.001
mm, just make her afraid
of something more


162
00:09:50.003 --> 00:09:52.871
than being with you
in that way.


163
00:09:52.873 --> 00:09:55.974
Which is?

164
00:09:55.976 --> 00:09:58.910
Mm, not being with you.

165
00:09:58.912 --> 00:10:01.412
But how?

166
00:10:01.414 --> 00:10:03.314
How am I supposed to do that?

167
00:10:03.316 --> 00:10:06.851
Mm... let life take over.

168
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.524
Uh, find a window, then pounce.

169
00:10:14.293 --> 00:10:15.560
That's it?

170
00:10:15.562 --> 00:10:17.962
That's your sage
neighborly advice?


171
00:10:17.964 --> 00:10:19.964
-
-Can I have my money back?

172
00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:21.866
Thomas...

173
00:10:21.868 --> 00:10:23.835
-Is it Thomas or Tom?
-It's Thomas.


174
00:10:23.837 --> 00:10:25.003
Not Tommy?

175
00:10:25.005 --> 00:10:28.006
-No, never, never.
-No? Ah, Thomas.


176
00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:29.874
You're not giving life
enough credit.


177
00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:31.376
The unpredictable forces
of humanity.


178
00:10:31.378 --> 00:10:33.912
-My life is not unpredictable.
-Life is as much a dream


179
00:10:33.914 --> 00:10:35.446
-as it is a nightmare.
-My life is conventional.


180
00:10:35.448 --> 00:10:36.981
-My life is boring.
-No.


181
00:10:36.983 --> 00:10:41.186
It's as random
as it is deliberate.


182
00:10:41.188 --> 00:10:46.357
You know, as funny
as it is tragic.


183
00:10:46.359 --> 00:10:48.226
Yours is no exception.

184
00:10:48.228 --> 00:10:50.195
I got to piss.

185
00:10:56.536 --> 00:10:59.838
<i>Dinner parties were</i>
<i>Judith's safety blanket.</i>


186
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.574
<i>A tableful of artists</i>
<i>took her mind off herself.</i>


187
00:11:02.576 --> 00:11:05.844
<i>The swirl of distraction,</i>
<i>seating plans,</i>


188
00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:07.412
<i>gossip, food--</i>

189
00:11:07.414 --> 00:11:10.114
<i>anything</i>
<i>to keep away the dread.</i>


190
00:11:10.116 --> 00:11:13.218
<i>They were the perfect antidote</i>
<i>to her childhood dinners.</i>


191
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.087
<i>The silences,</i>
<i>the drunken outbursts.</i>


192
00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:18.056
<i>Artists came to New York</i>
<i>from all over,</i>


193
00:11:18.058 --> 00:11:21.059
<i>and she always took them in,</i>
<i>clinging to the illusion</i>


194
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:23.528
<i>of an open, happy family.</i>

195
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.430
Do you miss getting mugged
on central park west


196
00:11:25.432 --> 00:11:26.998
- while walking your dog?
- Exactly. Exactly.


197
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.435
No, but I do miss
the 2nd Avenue deli.


198
00:11:30.437 --> 00:11:32.237
-Uh-huh.
-I miss the Lenox Lounge.


199
00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:35.640
I mean, do you know what are
in those iconic places now?


200
00:11:35.642 --> 00:11:36.875
Urban Outfitters,

201
00:11:36.877 --> 00:11:38.409
-a Starbucks...
-Star...


202
00:11:38.411 --> 00:11:41.012
There's a John Varvatos
where CBGB's used to be.


203
00:11:41.014 --> 00:11:44.215
-
-New York's lost its soul.

204
00:11:44.217 --> 00:11:46.885
What was that, Thomas?

205
00:11:46.887 --> 00:11:49.053
Well, I was just agreeing
with David


206
00:11:49.055 --> 00:11:51.189
that New York
has lost its soul.


207
00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:53.358
Ever since he returned
from three months in Peru,


208
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.126
he's decided to hate
where he's from.


209
00:11:55.128 --> 00:11:56.661
No, it's true.

210
00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:58.396
New York's most vibrant
neighborhood at the moment


211
00:11:58.398 --> 00:11:59.464
is Philadelphia.

212
00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:04.502
That's very funny, Thomas.

213
00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:07.672
So, uh, Ethan, I heard that
you've commissioned Nick Bilton


214
00:12:07.674 --> 00:12:09.440
to write the biography
on Evan Douriff.


215
00:12:09.442 --> 00:12:11.609
Our mandate at Kenta
is very simple--


216
00:12:11.611 --> 00:12:13.511
BIOS on any haircut under 40

217
00:12:13.513 --> 00:12:16.014
as long as they're still
within their 15 minutes.


218
00:12:16.016 --> 00:12:18.116
Self-help, political rants.

219
00:12:18.118 --> 00:12:19.617
Nobody reads fiction anymore.

220
00:12:19.619 --> 00:12:21.319
And once a writer.

221
00:12:21.321 --> 00:12:24.422
- So cynical, Ethan Webb.
- -I know. -


222
00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:27.191
if I were a writer, we'd be
having this conversation


223
00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:29.060
in a two-bedroom in Bushwick.

224
00:12:29.062 --> 00:12:30.695
Oh, that's true.
-Bushwick is expensive now.


225
00:12:30.697 --> 00:12:32.263
-
-Yeah, exactly.

226
00:12:32.265 --> 00:12:33.531
I'm serious.
I'm really serious.


227
00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:35.566
I mean,
most novelists these days,


228
00:12:35.568 --> 00:12:38.202
they don't earn enough money
to support themselves.


229
00:12:38.204 --> 00:12:40.371
-True. -No matter
how talented they are.


230
00:12:40.373 --> 00:12:43.574
That's why if Thomas came to me
with a desire to be a writer,


231
00:12:43.576 --> 00:12:46.144
well... I'd talk him out of it.

232
00:12:47.614 --> 00:12:50.548
So, you're still
tutoring, right?


233
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.417
Yeah. Just for some extra cash.

234
00:12:52.419 --> 00:12:54.485
- He could be a Spanish
teacher. - Yes, he could.


235
00:12:54.487 --> 00:12:56.421
I don't know if I could be
a Spanish teacher.


236
00:12:56.423 --> 00:12:58.389
If he went back to college
for a year.


237
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:00.725
For some reason,
he refuses to do it.


238
00:13:00.727 --> 00:13:03.461
He lives on the lower east side
without any direction.


239
00:13:03.463 --> 00:13:05.663
The only thing missing
is an opium habit.


240
00:13:05.665 --> 00:13:08.099
What about
doing a smartphone application?


241
00:13:49.108 --> 00:13:51.142
This man moved in
across the hall from me.


242
00:13:51.144 --> 00:13:53.578
I don't know what he does
or who he is, but...


243
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.313
He seems familiar to me.

244
00:13:55.315 --> 00:13:56.681
He's my new friend.

245
00:13:56.683 --> 00:13:59.117
-Aw.
-Yeah.


246
00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:00.618
-He asked about you.
-Me?


247
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.153
-Mm-hmm.
-He knows me?


248
00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:12.263
What's my father doing here?

249
00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:17.335
Who's he with?

250
00:14:17.337 --> 00:14:20.371
I don't know.

251
00:14:22.107 --> 00:14:24.175
She's beautiful.

252
00:14:52.237 --> 00:14:54.238
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

253
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.575
what this is gonna do
to my mother?


254
00:14:57.577 --> 00:15:00.711
This doesn't mean
your father loves you any less.


255
00:15:03.817 --> 00:15:06.584
-Sorry. That was bad.
-That was.


256
00:15:06.586 --> 00:15:09.287
I know, like dispensing therapy
from an after-school special.


257
00:15:09.289 --> 00:15:13.124
He doesn't care about me
to begin with, I know that.


258
00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:15.259
This...

259
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:17.261
This is about my mother.

260
00:15:17.263 --> 00:15:19.430
Yeah, but...
It's their problem.


261
00:15:19.432 --> 00:15:20.832
You have your own problems.

262
00:15:20.834 --> 00:15:22.567
Like what?

263
00:15:22.569 --> 00:15:24.202
-Uh...
-Actually, don't.


264
00:15:24.204 --> 00:15:26.604
-
-Don't answer that. Not now.

265
00:15:26.606 --> 00:15:30.208
-
-Thomas.

266
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.742
Look at me.

267
00:15:31.744 --> 00:15:35.480
Look, your parents,

268
00:15:35.482 --> 00:15:39.650
their world
is nothing like ours.


269
00:15:41.753 --> 00:15:45.623
I mean, maybe
it's their generation or...


270
00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:48.159
I don't know-- this island.

271
00:15:50.195 --> 00:15:52.697
But you're kind.

272
00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:55.566
And you're real.

273
00:16:10.482 --> 00:16:13.151
Don't do that.

274
00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:22.894
I mean, look, you're young,

275
00:16:22.896 --> 00:16:24.896
and your defense mechanisms
are strong.


276
00:16:24.898 --> 00:16:26.597
But I think that you want this.

277
00:16:26.599 --> 00:16:28.199
-I really do.
-I think...


278
00:16:28.201 --> 00:16:29.734
I think that you're confused
right now.


279
00:16:29.736 --> 00:16:32.370
No, Mimi, I'm angry right now.

280
00:16:32.372 --> 00:16:34.372
I'm angry.

281
00:16:34.374 --> 00:16:36.841
Did you see that woman? Did
you see how beautiful she was?


282
00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:40.811
I could never get a woman
like that.


283
00:16:40.813 --> 00:16:42.580
But my father,
with his publishing house


284
00:16:42.582 --> 00:16:45.716
and his-his good looks
and his-his cheating...


285
00:16:45.718 --> 00:16:47.919
-Fucking hair.
-Wow.


286
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:50.755
So, what, you're gonna use
your father's affair


287
00:16:50.757 --> 00:16:54.225
as a confirmation
of your own inadequacies?


288
00:16:56.695 --> 00:16:58.629
No, Mimi.

289
00:17:00.632 --> 00:17:02.833
I have you for that.

290
00:17:05.371 --> 00:17:09.340
So, you call my office,
you say you want to have lunch.


291
00:17:09.342 --> 00:17:11.442
You never want to have lunch.

292
00:17:11.444 --> 00:17:13.444
I figured you had
a big surprise.


293
00:17:13.446 --> 00:17:15.279
Maybe you've figured out
your life.


294
00:17:15.281 --> 00:17:17.415
No. Definitely haven't
figured out my life.


295
00:17:17.417 --> 00:17:19.917
-Mm. Bruce. -I wanted
to speak to you about...


296
00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.686
-Thank you for the tickets.
-Good-good to see you.


297
00:17:21.688 --> 00:17:23.588
-Well, of course. Any time.
-Oh, she enjoyed the show.


298
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.223
-Judith. Very much. -It was...
It was good, wasn't it?


299
00:17:25.225 --> 00:17:26.791
-Yeah, it was great.
-Great. Say hi to Judith.


300
00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:28.826
I will, indeed. All right.

301
00:17:28.828 --> 00:17:32.496
I want you to move
from the lower east side.


302
00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:35.499
Why do you insist on living
in the farthest corner


303
00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:37.401
of Manhattan away from us?

304
00:17:37.403 --> 00:17:39.670
I think it's intentional.

305
00:17:39.672 --> 00:17:43.374
I think it's almost... hurtful.

306
00:17:43.376 --> 00:17:46.277
Look...

307
00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:47.979
I'm not asking for me.

308
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:50.514
I'm asking for your mother.

309
00:17:50.516 --> 00:17:52.516
She wants you closer to home.

310
00:17:52.518 --> 00:17:54.685
How is mom?

311
00:17:56.355 --> 00:17:59.023
Better.

312
00:17:59.025 --> 00:18:00.958
I guess.

313
00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:04.962
Can't get her to quit smoking.

314
00:18:04.964 --> 00:18:06.530
Well, she's fragile.

315
00:18:06.532 --> 00:18:09.000
Anything, even
the smallest thing, could...


316
00:18:09.002 --> 00:18:12.637
Create another... incident.

317
00:18:19.378 --> 00:18:21.545
I'll pay the difference
in rent.


318
00:18:21.547 --> 00:18:23.547
Hmm?

319
00:18:25.584 --> 00:18:27.652
Will you think about it?

320
00:18:27.654 --> 00:18:29.787
-Dad...
-Also, I set up an appointment


321
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:31.389
with a career counselor
for you.


322
00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:33.424
My office will e-mail you
the info.


323
00:18:33.426 --> 00:18:36.060
Dad, I know you're...
I-I know...


324
00:18:36.062 --> 00:18:38.062
You know I'm what, Thomas?

325
00:18:40.065 --> 00:18:42.566
I know you're just
trying to help.


326
00:18:42.568 --> 00:18:44.335
Don't blow it off, okay?

327
00:18:44.337 --> 00:18:46.871
-I had to call in a favor
for her to see you. -All right.


328
00:18:46.873 --> 00:18:50.408
She actually has
a waiting list.


329
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.810
<i>Are you gonna confront</i>
<i>your father?</i>


330
00:18:52.812 --> 00:18:55.713
No. Trouble talking to him.

331
00:18:55.715 --> 00:18:57.948
Why?

332
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.519
I don't think
he likes me that much.


333
00:19:01.521 --> 00:19:04.522
What, uh...

334
00:19:04.524 --> 00:19:07.958
What exactly is wrong
with your mother?


335
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.895
I don't know.
She's depressed, bipolar.


336
00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:13.998
She's a depressive bipolar.

337
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.468
She came from
a broken home, so...


338
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.570
Whenever anything threatens
our perfect family,


339
00:19:19.572 --> 00:19:22.606
she completely unravels.

340
00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:27.478
I can't tell her.
She'll be destroyed.


341
00:19:29.949 --> 00:19:32.550
Why don't you furnish
this place, hmm?


342
00:19:32.552 --> 00:19:34.685
I live in Brooklyn.

343
00:19:36.722 --> 00:19:38.589
You have two apartments?

344
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:40.591
I'm rich.

345
00:19:40.593 --> 00:19:42.760
I'm a fucking Duke.

346
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.538
Or maybe he's...
Been faithful all these years.


347
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.474
Maybe she came on to him.
I've seen her.


348
00:19:56.476 --> 00:19:58.943
-She's irresistible. I mean...
-Uh, stop.


349
00:20:00.912 --> 00:20:02.713
What do you want?

350
00:20:02.715 --> 00:20:04.715
-I want my father to stop
seeing this woman. -No, no, no.


351
00:20:04.717 --> 00:20:07.785
No, in life.

352
00:20:07.787 --> 00:20:10.921
In your life.

353
00:20:10.923 --> 00:20:12.523
You want more money?

354
00:20:12.525 --> 00:20:14.725
You want more respect?

355
00:20:14.727 --> 00:20:16.694
You know?

356
00:20:16.696 --> 00:20:19.563
What is it that you want?

357
00:20:19.565 --> 00:20:21.565
Think about it.

358
00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:24.635
Really think about it.

359
00:20:24.637 --> 00:20:26.637
I want to be better.

360
00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:28.439
-Better?
-Mm.


361
00:20:28.441 --> 00:20:30.408
Than what?

362
00:20:36.448 --> 00:20:38.849
Than them.

363
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:41.719
<i>In the '80s,</i>
<i>Ethan was intoxicated</i>


364
00:20:41.721 --> 00:20:44.188
<i>by literary New York.</i>

365
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.457
<i>But when he accepted</i>
<i>that he lacked the talent</i>


366
00:20:46.459 --> 00:20:48.058
<i>to create a fictional family,</i>

367
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.128
<i>he thought at least</i>
<i>he could create a real one.</i>


368
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.597
<i>Young Thomas loved to write.</i>

369
00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:55.466
<i>Ethan ignored this,</i>

370
00:20:55.468 --> 00:20:59.603
<i>wary of nurturing a life</i>
<i>of rejections and evictions,</i>


371
00:20:59.605 --> 00:21:03.007
<i>and Thomas learned to keep</i>
<i>his stories to himself.</i>


372
00:21:03.009 --> 00:21:05.676
<i>The intensity of Judith's bond</i>
<i>with her son</i>


373
00:21:05.678 --> 00:21:09.647
<i>left Ethan feeling like</i>
<i>a stranger in his own home.</i>


374
00:21:09.649 --> 00:21:11.782
<i>He sought refuge in work,</i>

375
00:21:11.784 --> 00:21:15.219
<i>until publishing began</i>
<i>its slow decline.</i>


376
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:18.456
<i>Then... came Johanna.</i>

377
00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:21.792
You know, private detectives
get paid by the hour.


378
00:21:21.794 --> 00:21:23.961
To just-just wait.

379
00:21:23.963 --> 00:21:25.963
To do exactly what we're doing
right now.


380
00:21:25.965 --> 00:21:28.699
I mean, what is the difficulty
in a stakeout?


381
00:21:30.735 --> 00:21:32.603
I really got to go to class.

382
00:21:32.605 --> 00:21:33.971
No, just wait, all right?

383
00:21:33.973 --> 00:21:37.107
He'll be out in a minute.

384
00:21:37.109 --> 00:21:40.044
I have to see
if he's gonna meet her again.


385
00:21:40.046 --> 00:21:42.646
Please, just wait.

386
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.951
Okay.

387
00:21:51.656 --> 00:21:53.157
Oh, my god, that's her.

388
00:21:53.159 --> 00:21:55.159
The other woman.

389
00:21:56.895 --> 00:21:58.128
I'll call you later.

390
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.930
Wait, are we waiting
for your dad?


391
00:21:59.932 --> 00:22:01.899
I'll call you later.

392
00:23:43.368 --> 00:23:47.905
<i>What is it, exactly,</i>
<i>that you want to accomplish?</i>


393
00:23:47.907 --> 00:23:50.240
I want to meet her.

394
00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:52.343
And tell her
to stop seeing my father.


395
00:23:52.345 --> 00:23:54.211
She could kill my mother.

396
00:23:54.213 --> 00:23:56.213
Well, so do it.

397
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.884
I haven't built up
the courage yet.


398
00:24:00.886 --> 00:24:02.820
Mm.

399
00:24:02.822 --> 00:24:04.888
So you stalk her, huh?

400
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.091
I shouldn't be dealing
with this at all.


401
00:24:07.093 --> 00:24:09.627
- I should be on a beach...

402
00:24:09.629 --> 00:24:12.162
With Mimi...

403
00:24:12.164 --> 00:24:15.032
Naked...

404
00:24:15.034 --> 00:24:18.636
In Croatia.

405
00:24:18.638 --> 00:24:20.237
We should be together together.

406
00:24:20.239 --> 00:24:21.939
"Should" is a dangerous word.

407
00:24:21.941 --> 00:24:24.274
I'm serious, man.

408
00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:26.644
If it wasn't for my mother,
I wouldn't be here.


409
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.216
I don't buy it.

410
00:24:32.218 --> 00:24:35.252
You don't buy what?

411
00:24:35.254 --> 00:24:39.657
I don't buy that this is just
about your mother's health.


412
00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:41.859
You want something more here.

413
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:44.662
Something more what?

414
00:24:44.664 --> 00:24:46.897
Provocative.

415
00:24:59.678 --> 00:25:01.745
Excuse me.

416
00:25:01.747 --> 00:25:03.814
- Excuse me.
- -Yes.


417
00:25:03.816 --> 00:25:05.683
Y-you don't know who I am.

418
00:25:05.685 --> 00:25:07.351
Yes, I do.

419
00:25:07.353 --> 00:25:08.886
You do?

420
00:25:08.888 --> 00:25:10.287
You're the boy who follows me.

421
00:25:10.289 --> 00:25:12.022
Yeah, well,
I have a good reason.


422
00:25:12.024 --> 00:25:15.025
You're also Ethan's son.

423
00:25:15.027 --> 00:25:17.428
He keeps a picture of you
on his desk.


424
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:21.298
Are you hungry, Thomas?

425
00:25:31.242 --> 00:25:34.978
Following someone in this city
has got to be very difficult.


426
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.281
It's so easy
to be anonymous here.


427
00:25:37.283 --> 00:25:39.850
Why didn't you say anything
when I was following you?


428
00:25:39.852 --> 00:25:41.385
Why didn't you say anything?

429
00:25:41.387 --> 00:25:43.754
Because I didn't know
what I was gonna do.


430
00:25:43.756 --> 00:25:45.723
-And do you now?
-Yes.


431
00:25:45.725 --> 00:25:48.158
Is it good?

432
00:25:51.996 --> 00:25:54.865
-Johanna.
-Johanna?


433
00:25:54.867 --> 00:25:56.333
Yeah, I'm Johanna.

434
00:25:56.335 --> 00:25:58.902
Okay, Johanna, how long
you been fucking my father?


435
00:25:58.904 --> 00:26:01.338
Is that kind of vulgarity
entirely necessary here?


436
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.440
What kind of vulgarity
would you prefer?


437
00:26:06.144 --> 00:26:08.078
A little bit over a year.

438
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.347
Why are you even seeing him?
He's married.


439
00:26:10.349 --> 00:26:12.883
He is married.

440
00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:17.321
-Do you work with him?
-Sometimes.


441
00:26:17.323 --> 00:26:22.059
I'm a freelance editor,
so I work for all the houses.


442
00:26:23.828 --> 00:26:26.163
Do you love him?

443
00:26:26.165 --> 00:26:28.766
Define love, Thomas.

444
00:26:28.768 --> 00:26:30.901
Do you think
that you're gonna marry him?


445
00:26:30.903 --> 00:26:33.370
Is that the plan? You think
you're gonna steal him away


446
00:26:33.372 --> 00:26:35.105
from my mother?

447
00:26:35.107 --> 00:26:37.508
How do you know your mother
isn't giving him to me?


448
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.177
What's that supposed to mean?

449
00:26:40.179 --> 00:26:43.914
I mean that people do things
all the time without realizing.


450
00:26:43.916 --> 00:26:46.383
Your mother may be giving me
Ethan without comprehending it.


451
00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:52.456
I mean, you're doing something
right now without realizing it.


452
00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:54.458
Yeah? And what am I doing?

453
00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.393
You're trying
to make love to me.


454
00:26:56.395 --> 00:26:58.462
I'm trying to make love to you?

455
00:26:58.464 --> 00:27:01.064
I'm trying
to make love to you?


456
00:27:03.067 --> 00:27:05.569
You just don't realize it.

457
00:27:08.072 --> 00:27:10.073
Andy Warhol was
a close, personal friend,


458
00:27:10.075 --> 00:27:12.910
and he gave us that piece
as a gift.


459
00:27:12.912 --> 00:27:16.480
And now this goddamn committee
is going to take all that away.


460
00:27:16.482 --> 00:27:18.081
Mom, it doesn't really matter.

461
00:27:18.083 --> 00:27:20.083
These people,
these non-entities in Chelsea,


462
00:27:20.085 --> 00:27:21.451
they're trying
to steal my past.


463
00:27:21.453 --> 00:27:23.554
-They're trying to
erase my memories. -Mom.


464
00:27:25.123 --> 00:27:27.324
We're gonna find the photo.

465
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.462
Look at this mess.

466
00:27:32.464 --> 00:27:34.364
I need a cigarette.

467
00:27:36.068 --> 00:27:38.068
But your father has declared

468
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.470
I'm no longer allowed
to smoke in the house, so...


469
00:27:40.472 --> 00:27:43.473
--All right, well, I'll
stay here and keep searching.


470
00:27:46.611 --> 00:27:50.981
Thomas, I want to smoke and
talk to you at the same time.


471
00:27:50.983 --> 00:27:53.851
-It makes the cigarette better.
-Okay.


472
00:27:53.853 --> 00:27:56.119
Thank you.

473
00:27:58.122 --> 00:28:00.390
It's just this perpetual cycle

474
00:28:00.392 --> 00:28:03.260
of expectations
and disappointments.


475
00:28:05.296 --> 00:28:06.597
You know?

476
00:28:06.599 --> 00:28:09.499
The farthest distance
in the world


477
00:28:09.501 --> 00:28:14.137
is between how it is and how
you thought it was gonna be.


478
00:28:14.139 --> 00:28:17.140
Don't forget that.

479
00:28:17.142 --> 00:28:19.142
I won't.

480
00:28:21.112 --> 00:28:24.615
You're my light, Thomas.

481
00:28:24.617 --> 00:28:26.984
You know?

482
00:28:26.986 --> 00:28:30.153
I don't know what I'd do
without you.


483
00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.292
It's this Klonopin.

484
00:28:35.294 --> 00:28:37.961
-Makes me so fucking emotional.
-You're fine.


485
00:28:44.535 --> 00:28:46.904
I want you
to stop seeing my father.


486
00:28:46.906 --> 00:28:48.305
Oh, hello, Thomas.

487
00:28:48.307 --> 00:28:49.907
Look, you're
a very beautiful woman.


488
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:51.909
You can get any man
you want in this city.


489
00:28:51.911 --> 00:28:53.543
Could I get you?

490
00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:55.379
-
-What?

491
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:57.915
You said I can get any man
in this city.


492
00:28:57.917 --> 00:29:01.285
So I'm asking, could I get you?

493
00:29:01.287 --> 00:29:03.587
Which actually begs
another question, really.


494
00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:05.322
Are you a man?

495
00:29:05.324 --> 00:29:07.057
My mother's in a fragile state.

496
00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:08.959
This affair could put her
over the top.


497
00:29:08.961 --> 00:29:10.661
-How am I responsible for your
mother? -Because you're fucking


498
00:29:10.663 --> 00:29:12.362
-my father. -Okay, we know
that crudeness doesn't


499
00:29:12.364 --> 00:29:13.697
-make one a man.
-Stop seeing him.


500
00:29:13.699 --> 00:29:14.965
Nor do demands.

501
00:29:14.967 --> 00:29:16.266
I'm not trying to be a man.

502
00:29:16.268 --> 00:29:17.668
I'm not trying
to make love to you.


503
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.470
I'm trying to save my mother.

504
00:29:20.472 --> 00:29:22.472
You're getting closer.

505
00:29:30.648 --> 00:29:32.950
<i>Johanna wasn't raised</i>
<i>by writers.</i>


506
00:29:32.952 --> 00:29:35.652
<i>She was raised by bankers.</i>

507
00:29:35.654 --> 00:29:39.056
<i>But the lingua franca of both</i>
<i>is fiction.</i>


508
00:29:39.058 --> 00:29:41.725
<i>When Ethan floated the idea</i>
<i>of leaving his wife,</i>


509
00:29:41.727 --> 00:29:44.728
<i>she assumed it was just talk.</i>

510
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:50.567
<i>But to her surprise,</i>
<i>his suggestion unbalanced her.</i>


511
00:29:50.569 --> 00:29:55.405
<i>Instead of feeling flattered,</i>
<i>she felt suddenly needy.</i>


512
00:29:55.407 --> 00:29:58.241
<i>Thomas's attention</i>
<i>was the perfect remedy</i>


513
00:29:58.243 --> 00:30:01.011
<i>to her rattled confidence.</i>

514
00:30:01.013 --> 00:30:04.014
Those visions of Johanna.

515
00:30:04.016 --> 00:30:08.118
She's not like anyone
I've ever met.


516
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.021
She said I was trying
to make love to her.


517
00:30:11.023 --> 00:30:13.724
Oh. Were you?

518
00:30:13.726 --> 00:30:16.259
No, I want her to stop
seeing my father.


519
00:30:18.262 --> 00:30:20.297
Isn't that between
you and your father?


520
00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:24.568
Why-why would you
want to make contact with her?


521
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.405
She's an outsider to what seems
to me to be a family issue.


522
00:30:28.407 --> 00:30:30.407
Eat that.

523
00:30:32.543 --> 00:30:34.711
-Uh-huh.
-It's good.


524
00:30:34.713 --> 00:30:36.213
What was it?

525
00:30:36.215 --> 00:30:38.415
You don't want to know.

526
00:30:38.417 --> 00:30:42.386
So what are you saying, that...
I like dealing with her?


527
00:30:42.388 --> 00:30:44.421
Uh-huh. That's precisely
what I'm saying.


528
00:30:44.423 --> 00:30:46.423
And that I want
to make love to her.


529
00:30:46.425 --> 00:30:48.225
Would you like
to make love to her?


530
00:30:48.227 --> 00:30:50.727
No.

531
00:30:50.729 --> 00:30:52.729
What kind of
a question is that?


532
00:30:52.731 --> 00:30:54.698
-It's sick.
-How is that sick?


533
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.199
It's sick.

534
00:30:56.201 --> 00:30:57.534
She's a beautiful woman.

535
00:30:57.536 --> 00:30:59.569
-So?
-Her name is Johanna.


536
00:30:59.571 --> 00:31:02.506
She's sleeping with my father.

537
00:31:02.508 --> 00:31:04.441
Would you like to make love
to Johanna?


538
00:31:04.443 --> 00:31:06.410
Will you give me
some credit, please?


539
00:31:06.412 --> 00:31:08.812
-This conversation's perverse.
-Just ans-answer the question.


540
00:31:08.814 --> 00:31:10.680
-Give me some credit.
-Stop drowning yourself


541
00:31:10.682 --> 00:31:12.482
in what you think is moral.

542
00:31:12.484 --> 00:31:14.484
You want to fuck Johanna.

543
00:31:21.826 --> 00:31:25.195
Yes. I would.

544
00:31:25.197 --> 00:31:27.230
And you said
your life was boring.


545
00:31:53.157 --> 00:31:55.459
I couldn't have
handled today without you.


546
00:31:55.461 --> 00:31:57.861
You know, I got hit on three
times coming from the bathroom.


547
00:31:57.863 --> 00:31:59.663
And I'm pretty sure
they were all married.


548
00:31:59.665 --> 00:32:01.865
Then it's a good thing
my father isn't here.


549
00:32:01.867 --> 00:32:03.867
- That's not funny.
- Oh, no.


550
00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:05.368
Groom's coming.

551
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:06.803
It's my Ninja.

552
00:32:06.805 --> 00:32:09.239
-It's my motherfucking Ninja.
-Howard.


553
00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:10.507
-Congratulations, man.
-Thanks, man.


554
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:12.142
Hey, this is Mimi.

555
00:32:12.144 --> 00:32:14.277
-Howard. -Nice to meet you.
Listen. -Congrats.


556
00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:16.246
I've been running through
Riverside Park every day,


557
00:32:16.248 --> 00:32:18.248
nine miles,
murdering sobriety.


558
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.884
I've seen a lot of your mother
lately, actually.


559
00:32:20.886 --> 00:32:22.652
-My mother?
-Yeah, yeah. I don't know.


560
00:32:22.654 --> 00:32:25.655
She's, uh, always on
the same bench reading a book.


561
00:32:25.657 --> 00:32:27.324
That's Irwin. Irwin!

562
00:32:27.326 --> 00:32:28.825
You guys got to meet
Irwin Sanders.


563
00:32:28.827 --> 00:32:30.360
He's buying the Knicks.

564
00:32:30.362 --> 00:32:31.495
Howard.
-Hey.


565
00:32:31.497 --> 00:32:32.796
How does it feel to be married?

566
00:32:32.798 --> 00:32:34.197
-Well, sex already sucks.
-Ah.


567
00:32:34.199 --> 00:32:36.266
Kidding. Kind of.

568
00:32:36.268 --> 00:32:38.735
Uh, CondÃ© Nast
took me back, actually,


569
00:32:38.737 --> 00:32:41.238
so, uh, maybe I could get
an interview at some point?


570
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.572
Maybe.

571
00:32:42.574 --> 00:32:45.442
Um, Howard,
this is my friend, Johanna.


572
00:32:45.444 --> 00:32:46.877
-Hi.
-Congratulations.


573
00:32:46.879 --> 00:32:49.246
Nice to meet you.
Thanks. This is Thomas.


574
00:32:49.248 --> 00:32:51.548
- Hi. -Johanna.
- Mimi.


575
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.250
Hi.

576
00:33:03.162 --> 00:33:04.694
You're being really obvious.

577
00:33:22.948 --> 00:33:25.916
I'm not dating Irwin.

578
00:33:25.918 --> 00:33:27.417
It's none of your business.

579
00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:29.452
I don't have to
explain myself to you,


580
00:33:29.454 --> 00:33:31.688
but nonetheless...

581
00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.690
He's a very good friend.

582
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.661
Where's your girlfriend?

583
00:33:37.663 --> 00:33:40.497
She's not.

584
00:33:40.499 --> 00:33:42.699
She's just a friend.

585
00:33:42.701 --> 00:33:45.402
Oh, you shouldn't
let her do that to you.


586
00:33:50.474 --> 00:33:52.576
He's 30 years older than you.

587
00:33:52.578 --> 00:33:54.511
He's a billionaire.

588
00:33:54.513 --> 00:33:55.779
I'm not stupid.

589
00:33:55.781 --> 00:33:58.448
You are quite stupid, Thomas.

590
00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.718
And you've got no idea
how the world works.


591
00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.520
And, actually, he's not
a billionaire anymore,


592
00:34:03.522 --> 00:34:04.888
because Nancy
got half of everything.


593
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.423
Doesn't really matter.

594
00:34:06.425 --> 00:34:08.258
No, it doesn't.

595
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.595
You look nice.

596
00:34:11.597 --> 00:34:13.363
What?

597
00:34:13.365 --> 00:34:14.965
You look very nice.

598
00:34:14.967 --> 00:34:18.468
In a suit.

599
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:20.370
I don't really think
you're stupid.


600
00:34:20.372 --> 00:34:22.372
Just...

601
00:34:22.374 --> 00:34:25.742
Confused and... young.

602
00:34:27.745 --> 00:34:30.280
Irwin's probably
looking for you.


603
00:34:30.282 --> 00:34:31.948
I'm sure he paid
for the whole night.


604
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:33.950
Oh, fuck you, really.

605
00:34:39.423 --> 00:34:41.424
Hey.

606
00:34:41.426 --> 00:34:43.526
-So, first of all--
hooker comments? -I know.


607
00:34:43.528 --> 00:34:45.262
-I'm sorry. -You actually
resorted to hooker comments?


608
00:34:45.264 --> 00:34:46.696
I'm sorry. I apologize.

609
00:34:46.698 --> 00:34:49.899
Okay, second of all,
Irwin's gay.


610
00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:51.501
Okay? He loves men.

611
00:34:51.503 --> 00:34:53.270
In fact, he loves
one man in particular,


612
00:34:53.272 --> 00:34:54.971
a man named Billy Arnaldi,
who happens to be


613
00:34:54.973 --> 00:34:57.774
an incredible art dealer
and one of my closest friends.


614
00:34:57.776 --> 00:35:00.277
So Irwin doesn't want to
come out, for business reasons,


615
00:35:00.279 --> 00:35:01.678
which is his prerogative,

616
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.580
and I come to events
like this with him.


617
00:35:03.582 --> 00:35:05.615
I'm not a glorified hooker.
He's not a sugar daddy.


618
00:35:05.617 --> 00:35:07.050
I'm his beard.

619
00:35:07.052 --> 00:35:09.653
You really don't know
how the world works.


620
00:35:09.655 --> 00:35:12.355
You're an innocent, Thomas.
You're a child.


621
00:35:13.824 --> 00:35:15.558
I know some things.

622
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.693
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm.


623
00:35:16.695 --> 00:35:17.861
Like what?

624
00:35:20.765 --> 00:35:23.433
How it went down.

625
00:35:23.435 --> 00:35:25.402
You and my dad, I know.

626
00:35:25.404 --> 00:35:27.937
-Do you?
-Mm.


627
00:35:27.939 --> 00:35:31.641
Okay, Thomas, Mr. Ace Sleuth,

628
00:35:31.643 --> 00:35:33.643
I want to hear it.

629
00:35:36.547 --> 00:35:40.583
You noticed that
he liked to come in early.


630
00:35:40.585 --> 00:35:44.754
Really early, like, what,

631
00:35:44.756 --> 00:35:46.756
So you started
coming in then, too.


632
00:35:46.758 --> 00:35:48.625
You isolate and contain.

633
00:35:48.627 --> 00:35:51.061
Told him it was because
you don't sleep well,


634
00:35:51.063 --> 00:35:53.930
that the bad dreams, they shake
you awake before daylight.


635
00:35:53.932 --> 00:35:56.366
In the mornings, you put on
music in your office.


636
00:35:56.368 --> 00:35:58.935
Brahms one day, biggie smalls
the next, because, you know,


637
00:35:58.937 --> 00:36:02.105
you can't be put into a box;
You attack all the senses.


638
00:36:02.107 --> 00:36:04.908
You went a little aggressive
on your signature scent,


639
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.710
strong on the vanilla.

640
00:36:06.712 --> 00:36:09.846
You mentioned a boyfriend,
then complained of a bad date.


641
00:36:09.848 --> 00:36:11.748
You confuse him,
make him wonder.


642
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.017
The sex.

643
00:36:14.019 --> 00:36:15.618
Ooh, the sex.

644
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.787
The sex surprised you both.

645
00:36:17.789 --> 00:36:20.056
He was just walking you home
after dinner.


646
00:36:20.058 --> 00:36:22.058
I mean, Jesus, you're not
the other woman,


647
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.060
he's not a cheating husband.
"No, this isn't something


648
00:36:24.062 --> 00:36:27.397
that we did, that is something
that happened to us."


649
00:36:27.399 --> 00:36:29.866
But what? Could it be love?

650
00:36:29.868 --> 00:36:31.501
Well, nobody wants
to acknowledge that


651
00:36:31.503 --> 00:36:33.436
so soon in the game,
but the stars are crossed


652
00:36:33.438 --> 00:36:35.672
and people
are gonna get hurt and...


653
00:36:35.674 --> 00:36:37.407
"We've done a bad,
bad thing, Ethan,"


654
00:36:37.409 --> 00:36:39.075
so, fuck, it must be, right?

655
00:36:39.077 --> 00:36:43.079
All of it was just bullshit--
calculated and manipulated--


656
00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:44.848
from that first lie
about your bad dreams.


657
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:48.718
'Cause I'm-I'm...
I'm pretty sure...


658
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.921
That you sleep like a baby.

659
00:36:55.659 --> 00:36:57.660
You are quite the storytell...

660
00:37:31.962 --> 00:37:33.563
Where have you been?

661
00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:35.732
- Bathroom. Drank too much.

662
00:37:39.637 --> 00:37:42.205
I have to
interrupt now, because, uh...


663
00:37:42.207 --> 00:37:43.940
I have to go home.

664
00:37:46.511 --> 00:37:49.546
I'm Uncle Buster.

665
00:37:49.548 --> 00:37:51.748
-Let's get out of here.
-I'm Casey's father's brother.


666
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.082
They haven't even
cut the cake.


667
00:37:53.084 --> 00:37:54.784
Fuck the cake. Let's go.

668
00:37:54.786 --> 00:37:56.219
What?

669
00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:57.887
- Come on.
- Walter's not here


670
00:37:57.889 --> 00:37:59.989
-because...
-You smell like vanilla.


671
00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:02.559
...he's doing two to five.

672
00:38:02.561 --> 00:38:03.693
It's no secret.

673
00:38:03.695 --> 00:38:05.094
As you all know,

674
00:38:05.096 --> 00:38:08.064
two to five for doing
the right thing,


675
00:38:08.066 --> 00:38:10.967
for believing in the poetry
of the constitution.


676
00:38:15.573 --> 00:38:18.741
I have only a few thoughts.

677
00:38:18.743 --> 00:38:21.244
Drama.

678
00:38:21.246 --> 00:38:24.681
The dramatics
of marital romance,


679
00:38:24.683 --> 00:38:26.683
<i>staying together.</i>

680
00:38:28.953 --> 00:38:31.554
<i>Like the gypsy told me,</i>

681
00:38:31.556 --> 00:38:34.123
<i>the poems</i>
<i>written in life lines</i>


682
00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:37.594
<i>are never guaranteed.</i>

683
00:38:37.596 --> 00:38:40.597
<i>They get busted up.</i>

684
00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:44.234
<i>Tomorrow begins new poetry.</i>

685
00:38:44.236 --> 00:38:50.240
<i>Another romance that will</i>
<i>explode from time to time.</i>


686
00:38:50.242 --> 00:38:55.011
<i>Poetry of married people</i>
<i>like the Aurora Borealis.</i>


687
00:38:57.147 --> 00:39:00.884
<i>Strewn like stars in the sky,</i>

688
00:39:00.886 --> 00:39:05.154
<i>and the drama</i>
<i>of your lives begins.</i>


689
00:39:05.156 --> 00:39:07.690
<i>Chapter after chapter.</i>

690
00:39:07.692 --> 00:39:09.225
<i>Stories.</i>

691
00:39:09.227 --> 00:39:10.827
<i>Books.</i>

692
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:16.599
<i>Revolutions, as I know,</i>
<i>will come.</i>


693
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:18.001
<i>I've seen many.</i>

694
00:39:18.003 --> 00:39:20.169
<i>Lived through them.</i>

695
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:22.772
<i>They play in</i>
<i>the least expected places,</i>


696
00:39:22.774 --> 00:39:24.774
<i>so get ready.</i>

697
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.077
Casey understands Howard.

698
00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:31.581
Howard... knows Casey.

699
00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:33.550
No.

700
00:39:33.552 --> 00:39:35.818
No, not yet.

701
00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.820
There's always mystery.

702
00:39:37.822 --> 00:39:39.656
You both know that.

703
00:39:39.658 --> 00:39:42.158
You both know it isn't perfect.

704
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.826
<i>Excitement,</i>

705
00:39:43.828 --> 00:39:47.764
<i>trust and struggle,</i>

706
00:39:47.766 --> 00:39:53.102
<i>and the unknown privacies</i>
<i>that keep us together.</i>


707
00:39:53.104 --> 00:39:55.171
<i>Glue of struggle.</i>

708
00:39:57.174 --> 00:40:00.643
<i>I raise my glass.</i>

709
00:40:00.645 --> 00:40:04.614
<i>The fragile glass</i>
<i>we stomped on and shattered</i>


710
00:40:04.616 --> 00:40:07.884
<i>and will forever</i>
<i>be putting back together,</i>


711
00:40:07.886 --> 00:40:12.889
like the puzzles
we first worked as children,


712
00:40:12.891 --> 00:40:15.625
learning to be patient,

713
00:40:15.627 --> 00:40:18.061
searching for what fits.

714
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.234
So many puzzles.

715
00:40:25.236 --> 00:40:28.204
So many books in this room.

716
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.811
And I talk too much.

717
00:40:34.813 --> 00:40:36.913
Let's dance.

718
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:51.227
<i>So I have to go to this</i>
<i>career counselor.</i>


719
00:40:51.229 --> 00:40:53.229
<i>Uh, my father</i>
<i>set up the appointment.</i>


720
00:40:54.999 --> 00:40:56.733
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>go into journalism?</i>


721
00:40:56.735 --> 00:40:58.901
You ran
the high school newspaper.


722
00:40:58.903 --> 00:41:00.803
No, that doesn't
interest me anymore.


723
00:41:00.805 --> 00:41:02.705
And you won that
advertising prize in college.


724
00:41:02.707 --> 00:41:04.841
-You could do that.
-Uh, how do you know all this


725
00:41:04.843 --> 00:41:06.409
about me, huh?
How do you know all this?


726
00:41:06.411 --> 00:41:08.945
-I know everything.
Everything about you. -You do?


727
00:41:08.947 --> 00:41:11.214
-Okay, um, yearbook committee.
-Uh-huh.


728
00:41:11.216 --> 00:41:12.982
-President of the debate club.
-Yeah.


729
00:41:12.984 --> 00:41:15.018
Arts editor
of the high school newspaper.


730
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.919
Second single
on the tennis team.


731
00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:18.054
Very impressive, Thomas.

732
00:41:18.056 --> 00:41:20.390
Huh.

733
00:41:20.392 --> 00:41:23.393
Your father has
all your awards on his desk.


734
00:41:23.395 --> 00:41:24.927
It's so awful.

735
00:41:24.929 --> 00:41:26.663
- Oh, that's awkward.

736
00:41:26.665 --> 00:41:28.665
Fuck the career counselor.

737
00:41:30.734 --> 00:41:33.069
<i>All right, here's something</i>
<i>you don't know.</i>


738
00:41:33.071 --> 00:41:34.971
That nobody knows.

739
00:41:34.973 --> 00:41:36.839
Okay.

740
00:41:39.243 --> 00:41:41.978
I wanted to write.

741
00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:44.747
-Huh.
-Hmm.


742
00:41:44.749 --> 00:41:47.116
I used to write all these
things when I was younger.


743
00:41:47.118 --> 00:41:49.686
A bunch of letters
from my dog to, like,


744
00:41:49.688 --> 00:41:51.788
the mailman and the vet.

745
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.924
And eventually I...

746
00:41:54.926 --> 00:41:57.427
Came up with a collection
of essays called


747
00:41:57.429 --> 00:42:00.296
"Mary Jane vs. Everything."

748
00:42:00.298 --> 00:42:02.765
Which I was
incredibly proud of.


749
00:42:02.767 --> 00:42:05.735
And, you know,
I show 'em to my dad.


750
00:42:05.737 --> 00:42:08.438
What did Ethan say?

751
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.007
"Serviceable."

752
00:42:11.009 --> 00:42:12.742
Ouch.

753
00:42:12.744 --> 00:42:15.111
Yeah. "Serviceable."

754
00:42:15.113 --> 00:42:17.213
That was his exact word.

755
00:42:17.215 --> 00:42:20.717
Nothing special,
just serviceable.


756
00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:22.285
He seemed pretty angry
after reading them, though.


757
00:42:22.287 --> 00:42:23.720
Well, I want to read them.

758
00:42:23.722 --> 00:42:24.987
-You do?
-Yeah.


759
00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:26.089
-You can't.
-Why not?


760
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:27.290
'Cause I threw 'em out.

761
00:42:27.292 --> 00:42:30.960
Oh, that's so sad.

762
00:42:30.962 --> 00:42:33.863
-That's so sad and lonely.
-Mm.


763
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.869
That's good.

764
00:42:39.871 --> 00:42:41.337
Really?

765
00:42:41.339 --> 00:42:45.241
Yeah. What word
did your father use?


766
00:42:45.243 --> 00:42:46.809
"Serviceable."

767
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:48.978
I disagree.

768
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.980
I think you've got talent.

769
00:42:55.519 --> 00:42:59.455
But your father's a publisher
and I'm just some...


770
00:42:59.457 --> 00:43:02.959
Strange neighbor, so you're
gonna go with serviceable, huh?


771
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.431
-Johanna wanted to read 'em.
-Oh, right.


772
00:43:08.433 --> 00:43:10.032
But I don't know if I could...

773
00:43:10.034 --> 00:43:12.802
Those visions of Johanna.

774
00:43:12.804 --> 00:43:15.037
I think about her...

775
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:19.842
...all the time.

776
00:43:23.514 --> 00:43:25.515
Maybe it's love.

777
00:43:28.552 --> 00:43:30.920
Uh...

778
00:43:30.922 --> 00:43:32.555
Love is hard to determine.

779
00:43:32.557 --> 00:43:34.190
Uh, people think
they're in love,


780
00:43:34.192 --> 00:43:36.993
and it's something
completely different.


781
00:43:36.995 --> 00:43:39.996
You know, infatuation,

782
00:43:39.998 --> 00:43:42.231
the righting
of childhood wrongs,


783
00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:44.433
you know, companionship. Um...

784
00:43:46.136 --> 00:43:47.870
Have you ever been in love?

785
00:43:47.872 --> 00:43:49.872
Yeah. Once.

786
00:43:51.508 --> 00:43:53.376
Who was she?

787
00:43:53.378 --> 00:43:55.244
Oh...

788
00:43:55.246 --> 00:43:58.915
She was this woman I knew.

789
00:43:58.917 --> 00:44:02.485
She was taken by someone else,
a dear friend.


790
00:44:04.222 --> 00:44:07.423
We had a profound connection,
but she was his girl.


791
00:44:07.425 --> 00:44:09.091
It was a mess.

792
00:44:09.093 --> 00:44:11.160
So what did you do?

793
00:44:11.162 --> 00:44:14.363
Oh, I left
the scene of the crime.


794
00:44:14.365 --> 00:44:16.833
You ran away?

795
00:44:16.835 --> 00:44:20.570
Uh, well, at the time,
I called it an adventure.


796
00:44:20.572 --> 00:44:23.072
But hindsight turned it
into something else,


797
00:44:23.074 --> 00:44:26.075
which is what hindsight
inevitably does.


798
00:44:26.077 --> 00:44:27.977
Yeah, I ran away.

799
00:44:27.979 --> 00:44:29.979
I'm gonna take this.

800
00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:31.514
Leave you with your heart on.

801
00:44:31.516 --> 00:44:32.949
With my hard-on?

802
00:44:32.951 --> 00:44:35.618
Heart. Your heart on.

803
00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.087
You know what, maybe,
in hindsight,


804
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:40.590
I'll feel guilty about Johanna,
but right now I don't.


805
00:44:44.194 --> 00:44:45.995
It's not cut or dry.

806
00:44:45.997 --> 00:44:49.232
Congratulations, Thomas.

807
00:44:49.234 --> 00:44:51.901
Your world is
becoming contextual.


808
00:44:57.241 --> 00:44:59.041
Who the fuck are you?

809
00:45:09.987 --> 00:45:12.021
Hey, dad.

810
00:45:12.023 --> 00:45:14.023
What's up?

811
00:45:14.025 --> 00:45:16.158
Sit down.

812
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.131
Is everything all right?

813
00:45:22.133 --> 00:45:24.000
Is mom okay?

814
00:45:24.002 --> 00:45:26.269
Sit down, Thomas.

815
00:45:39.082 --> 00:45:41.951
Is there anything
you want to tell me?


816
00:45:45.088 --> 00:45:46.389
No.

817
00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:48.624
No, nothing.

818
00:45:48.626 --> 00:45:51.627
Mm-hmm. Anything I should know?

819
00:45:54.364 --> 00:45:56.365
No.

820
00:45:58.669 --> 00:46:01.370
Thomas...

821
00:46:01.372 --> 00:46:04.273
You blew off
the career counselor.


822
00:46:04.275 --> 00:46:05.708
Hmm?

823
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:08.244
I told you how hard it was
to get that appointment,


824
00:46:08.246 --> 00:46:10.046
and then you just
don't show up?


825
00:46:10.048 --> 00:46:11.380
-Whoosh. Gone.
-Right.


826
00:46:11.382 --> 00:46:13.649
Um, um...

827
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:15.551
I should've called.

828
00:46:15.553 --> 00:46:16.719
-Mm-hmm, you should've called.
-I'm sorry.


829
00:46:16.721 --> 00:46:19.255
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.

830
00:46:22.727 --> 00:46:24.327
Come work here.

831
00:46:24.329 --> 00:46:26.195
-
-Hmm? Work here.

832
00:46:26.197 --> 00:46:28.130
You like to read.

833
00:46:28.132 --> 00:46:29.999
I've been conflicted
about giving you a job here--


834
00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:33.002
nepotism and all that
bullshit-- but screw it.


835
00:46:33.004 --> 00:46:35.137
You can start
under the junior editors,


836
00:46:35.139 --> 00:46:36.339
you know, learn something.

837
00:46:36.341 --> 00:46:38.007
-No, thank you.
-Why not?


838
00:46:38.009 --> 00:46:39.275
I mean,
what's wrong with learning


839
00:46:39.277 --> 00:46:40.543
-the publishing business?
-Nothing.


840
00:46:40.545 --> 00:46:43.679
It's fine. It's just it's...

841
00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:45.681
Serviceable.

842
00:46:55.726 --> 00:46:58.594
W.F.?

843
00:46:58.596 --> 00:47:01.330
I just want
to get my essays back.


844
00:47:01.332 --> 00:47:03.332
Hey.

845
00:48:04.227 --> 00:48:05.795
Thomas.

846
00:48:05.797 --> 00:48:07.797
I was in your apartment.

847
00:48:11.301 --> 00:48:14.270
You're Julian Stellars.

848
00:48:14.272 --> 00:48:17.106
- Mm, my nom de plume.

849
00:48:17.108 --> 00:48:19.675
You've had 12 books published.

850
00:48:19.677 --> 00:48:21.410
You don't have
much mass appeal,


851
00:48:21.412 --> 00:48:23.546
but you don't seem to mind.

852
00:48:23.548 --> 00:48:26.715
Hard to find
a picture of you anywhere.


853
00:48:26.717 --> 00:48:28.851
You're an alcoholic
who spends most afternoons


854
00:48:28.853 --> 00:48:30.719
drinking in the Brooklyn Inn.

855
00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:32.788
And you're probably
the only person that I've met


856
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:36.525
that's actually, actually been
to an opium den.


857
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:40.796
-And I've been googled.
-Mm-hmm.


858
00:48:45.535 --> 00:48:48.537
I didn't read it.

859
00:48:48.539 --> 00:48:50.272
Your new manuscript.

860
00:48:53.543 --> 00:48:56.445
Well, Thomas,
I appreciate that.


861
00:49:03.153 --> 00:49:04.687
So, um...

862
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:09.291
...when you said
I had talent...


863
00:49:09.293 --> 00:49:12.294
It was a professional opinion.

864
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.467
I don't know, man. I...

865
00:49:18.469 --> 00:49:20.169
You've experienced the world.

866
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:22.338
I just live here in New York.

867
00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.306
New York is the world.

868
00:49:24.308 --> 00:49:26.575
I haven't done much
with my life.


869
00:49:29.746 --> 00:49:33.482
You've had sex
with your father's mistress.


870
00:49:33.484 --> 00:49:36.485
I'd say that's something.

871
00:49:38.488 --> 00:49:40.923
Am I the only living boy
in New York?


872
00:49:46.329 --> 00:49:48.330
You are.

873
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:08.551
<i>Hey, I was</i>
<i>outside your apartment.</i>


874
00:50:08.553 --> 00:50:10.219
<i>You're not there.</i>

875
00:50:10.221 --> 00:50:12.655
I brought the essays.
I wanted to show you.


876
00:50:52.862 --> 00:50:55.264
Did you sleep with her?

877
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.970
With who?

878
00:51:04.574 --> 00:51:07.276
Johanna?

879
00:51:07.278 --> 00:51:09.545
Why would you ask that?

880
00:51:09.547 --> 00:51:12.715
They left the wedding
as quickly as we did.


881
00:51:14.352 --> 00:51:16.352
I may be oblivious,
but I'm not stupid.


882
00:51:16.354 --> 00:51:17.419
Why do you care?

883
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:18.821
-I just do.
-Why?


884
00:51:18.823 --> 00:51:20.556
Thomas.

885
00:51:20.558 --> 00:51:22.558
-Are you jealous?
-No.


886
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.293
-You sure?
-Thomas.


887
00:51:24.295 --> 00:51:26.595
-I think you're jealous.
-Did you sleep with her?


888
00:51:26.597 --> 00:51:29.431
She's my father's mistress.

889
00:51:29.433 --> 00:51:31.467
You think that I would do that?

890
00:51:33.503 --> 00:51:35.304
No.

891
00:51:35.306 --> 00:51:37.039
Thank you.

892
00:51:39.476 --> 00:51:41.443
You're sweet.

893
00:51:41.445 --> 00:51:43.579
You're not like them.

894
00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:45.714
-Like who?
-This city.


895
00:51:54.624 --> 00:51:57.593
I want you to stop seeing him.

896
00:51:57.595 --> 00:51:59.595
--Come on,
I'm putting my foot down.


897
00:51:59.597 --> 00:52:01.497
You don't get to tell me
what to do, Thomas.


898
00:52:01.499 --> 00:52:03.365
I don't care
if your foot's down or up.


899
00:52:03.367 --> 00:52:05.067
Why? 'Cause you don't care
about anything?


900
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:08.604
-What? -You obviously don't
care about anything at all.


901
00:52:08.606 --> 00:52:11.340
Oh, so I'm a nihilist now,
am I?


902
00:52:14.779 --> 00:52:18.414
I don't know anything
about you.


903
00:52:18.416 --> 00:52:20.416
Where'd you grow up?

904
00:52:20.418 --> 00:52:22.951
Brooklyn, Thomas.
That's why I have this accent.


905
00:52:25.488 --> 00:52:27.489
Did you play sports?

906
00:52:27.491 --> 00:52:30.793
No.

907
00:52:30.795 --> 00:52:32.895
When did you first have sex?

908
00:52:32.897 --> 00:52:35.964
Oh, my god, we're gonna talk
about my childhood now?


909
00:52:35.966 --> 00:52:39.034
Yeah. I want to know you.

910
00:52:39.036 --> 00:52:41.937
Where'd you grow up?

911
00:52:41.939 --> 00:52:44.106
I grew up in London.

912
00:52:44.108 --> 00:52:46.575
Which part?

913
00:52:46.577 --> 00:52:49.578
Belsize park.

914
00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.647
And then Kilburn.

915
00:52:51.649 --> 00:52:53.782
Why the move?

916
00:52:53.784 --> 00:52:57.519
Because Kilburn's
so much more real.


917
00:52:57.521 --> 00:52:58.987
What'd your dad do?

918
00:53:01.991 --> 00:53:03.659
What'd your dad do?

919
00:53:03.661 --> 00:53:07.663
He put a gun in his mouth
and pulled the trigger.


920
00:53:17.974 --> 00:53:19.975
I'm sorry.

921
00:53:24.981 --> 00:53:26.982
I didn't know.

922
00:53:30.987 --> 00:53:33.722
Why do you sleep with me?

923
00:53:33.724 --> 00:53:35.491
Because I like you.

924
00:53:35.493 --> 00:53:38.761
What do you like about me?

925
00:53:38.763 --> 00:53:41.130
Your innocence.

926
00:53:41.132 --> 00:53:44.099
Were you ever innocent?

927
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:45.834
I forgot.

928
00:53:45.836 --> 00:53:48.837
Come on. Tell me.

929
00:53:48.839 --> 00:53:50.839
I want to know
about when you were innocent.


930
00:53:50.841 --> 00:53:53.709
-Why?
-Because I like the idea of it.


931
00:53:53.711 --> 00:53:56.478
If you want someone so pure,
why are you with me?


932
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.480
Because I care about you.

933
00:54:02.485 --> 00:54:06.021
Do you care about me?

934
00:54:06.023 --> 00:54:08.590
I don't care about anyone,
remember?


935
00:54:10.894 --> 00:54:14.596
<i>But the truth was</i>
<i>she cared about them both.</i>


936
00:54:14.598 --> 00:54:16.665
<i>And that's when she knew</i>

937
00:54:16.667 --> 00:54:19.001
<i>this mess</i>
<i>would only get worse.</i>


938
00:54:19.003 --> 00:54:23.906
<i>She had to make a clean break,</i>
<i>starting with Ethan.</i>


939
00:54:23.908 --> 00:54:26.642
<i>What she didn't anticipate was</i>

940
00:54:26.644 --> 00:54:28.877
<i>he'd surrendered too much</i>
<i>of his past</i>


941
00:54:28.879 --> 00:54:30.746
<i>to give up on his future.</i>

942
00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:37.753
They're all moving
to, uh, Los Angeles.


943
00:54:37.755 --> 00:54:40.155
New York, we're becoming...

944
00:54:40.157 --> 00:54:43.625
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>he's in love with her?</i>


945
00:54:43.627 --> 00:54:44.893
This has to stop.

946
00:54:44.895 --> 00:54:47.229
Eh, you and your father,

947
00:54:47.231 --> 00:54:50.098
you suffer from
the same disease.


948
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.167
Johanna.

949
00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:56.238
"Visions of Johanna
conquer my mind."


950
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.774
-Mm.
-Why are you writing about me?


951
00:55:01.644 --> 00:55:03.645
That's what I do.

952
00:55:03.647 --> 00:55:07.716
I write about people I know
and then give it a thin veil.


953
00:55:07.718 --> 00:55:09.852
But why me?

954
00:55:11.855 --> 00:55:13.722
Look, I...

955
00:55:13.724 --> 00:55:16.058
I got the apartment
to get out of the house


956
00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.060
and write
a completely different story.


957
00:55:18.062 --> 00:55:20.529
It just, it didn't
come across, you know?


958
00:55:20.531 --> 00:55:22.798
-And mine did.
-Um...


959
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.801
And like everything good,
it happened by accident.


960
00:55:25.803 --> 00:55:28.871
I met you. Now I got 118 pages.

961
00:55:30.874 --> 00:55:32.741
My father's publishing house,

962
00:55:32.743 --> 00:55:35.010
they're throwing
an anniversary party tomorrow.


963
00:55:35.012 --> 00:55:36.812
You should come.

964
00:55:38.815 --> 00:55:40.816
No.

965
00:55:40.818 --> 00:55:44.086
You've heard all about these
people, but you never met 'em.


966
00:55:44.088 --> 00:55:47.689
Be good for the book.

967
00:55:47.691 --> 00:55:48.824
Huh.

968
00:55:48.826 --> 00:55:52.160
Find a window. Pounce.

969
00:55:52.162 --> 00:55:54.162
Pounce.

970
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:15.751
I broke up with Nick.

971
00:56:17.587 --> 00:56:19.588
Did you?

972
00:56:24.193 --> 00:56:27.930
You're supposed to be
more excited than that.


973
00:57:09.038 --> 00:57:11.039
Hey.

974
00:57:11.041 --> 00:57:13.175
Thanks for coming.

975
00:57:13.177 --> 00:57:14.710
It's a great party.

976
00:57:14.712 --> 00:57:16.812
Yeah. It always is.

977
00:57:16.814 --> 00:57:19.781
Look. That's my mother
and Mimi.


978
00:57:24.187 --> 00:57:26.722
She's beautiful.

979
00:57:26.724 --> 00:57:28.357
Mm. I told you she was.

980
00:57:28.359 --> 00:57:30.692
I was talking about
your mother.


981
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:35.697
Huh.

982
00:57:50.346 --> 00:57:51.813
It's amazing.

983
00:57:51.815 --> 00:57:53.215
It is amazing,
but I think you could...


984
00:57:53.217 --> 00:57:54.650
Uh, sorry.

985
00:57:54.652 --> 00:57:55.984
I want you to come
meet someone.


986
00:57:55.986 --> 00:57:58.253
Oh! Who are we meeting?

987
00:57:58.255 --> 00:58:00.122
-We're meeting my new friend.
-Your new friend.


988
00:58:00.124 --> 00:58:01.690
-All right, I'll be back.
-Sorry. See you later.


989
00:58:01.692 --> 00:58:02.691
I'll be back.

990
00:58:07.296 --> 00:58:09.297
He was just here.

991
00:58:09.299 --> 00:58:11.099
He was?

992
00:58:11.101 --> 00:58:13.168
Oh, well, I'll meet him later.

993
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:15.303
-Come on. He was just here.
-Oh, there's Diana.


994
00:58:28.251 --> 00:58:33.989
"I have looked down upon
the city from high windows.


995
00:58:33.991 --> 00:58:38.060
"It is then
that the great buildings


996
00:58:38.062 --> 00:58:42.431
"lose reality and take on
their magical powers.


997
00:58:45.268 --> 00:58:51.006
"Squares and squares of flame
set and cut into the ether.


998
00:58:51.008 --> 00:58:53.942
Here's our poetry, for..."

999
00:58:53.944 --> 00:58:57.212
"For we have pulled down
the stars to our will."


1000
00:58:57.214 --> 00:58:58.947
"To our will."

1001
00:58:58.949 --> 00:59:00.749
Ezra Pound.

1002
00:59:02.752 --> 00:59:04.886
Johanna, I'm assuming.

1003
00:59:04.888 --> 00:59:07.289
We haven't met, have we?

1004
00:59:07.291 --> 00:59:10.759
No, but I know you very well.

1005
00:59:10.761 --> 00:59:15.030
And I know
that you're having your fun


1006
00:59:15.032 --> 00:59:17.299
and that he's young and easy.

1007
00:59:17.301 --> 00:59:21.503
But you'll have me to deal with
if he scars.


1008
00:59:25.374 --> 00:59:29.244
I don't like
strange conversations...


1009
00:59:29.246 --> 00:59:31.246
So I'm gonna walk away now.

1010
01:00:01.144 --> 01:00:03.145
I'll be back in a second.

1011
01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:12.220
Hey.

1012
01:00:12.222 --> 01:00:14.156
Uh...

1013
01:00:14.158 --> 01:00:16.424
What?

1014
01:00:16.426 --> 01:00:19.127
I really think we should
stop seeing each other.


1015
01:00:21.097 --> 01:00:22.864
-Thomas.
-What?


1016
01:00:22.866 --> 01:00:25.300
It looks bad. Come on.

1017
01:00:25.302 --> 01:00:29.104
I was ending it
with your father as well.


1018
01:00:29.106 --> 01:00:31.373
And not because
I didn't care for him.


1019
01:00:31.375 --> 01:00:34.843
I actually really do.
I care for him very much.


1020
01:00:34.845 --> 01:00:37.546
But, Thomas,
the thing is he proposed.


1021
01:00:37.548 --> 01:00:39.247
What?

1022
01:00:39.249 --> 01:00:42.450
And I said yes.

1023
01:00:42.452 --> 01:00:44.386
No. No.

1024
01:00:44.388 --> 01:00:46.321
-No, no. -Please, I don't
want this to be disruptive.


1025
01:00:46.323 --> 01:00:48.857
-Disruptive? He's not gonna
leave her. -Stop, stop, stop.


1026
01:00:48.859 --> 01:00:50.559
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1027
01:00:50.561 --> 01:00:52.561
No, this is
the best thing for everybody.


1028
01:00:52.563 --> 01:00:54.129
-For who?
-For everybody.


1029
01:00:54.131 --> 01:00:55.831
Judith's gonna be
so much better off.


1030
01:00:55.833 --> 01:00:57.065
She won't be suffering anymore

1031
01:00:57.067 --> 01:00:58.867
under the weight
of a dead marriage.


1032
01:00:58.869 --> 01:01:00.468
He's going through a cri...
He's just going through


1033
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:02.204
a fucking crisis,
that's all this is.


1034
01:01:02.206 --> 01:01:04.039
Come on, this doesn't
have to be this difficult.


1035
01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:06.408
Please, everybody can win here.

1036
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.877
God made a mistake
when he made you beautiful.


1037
01:01:08.879 --> 01:01:10.545
Well, god's mistake
is marrying your father.


1038
01:01:10.547 --> 01:01:12.314
Not yet she isn't.

1039
01:01:12.316 --> 01:01:14.583
Look, can I just ask you
one thing?


1040
01:01:14.585 --> 01:01:17.953
If any of this comes out, who
do you think's gonna get hurt?


1041
01:01:17.955 --> 01:01:19.221
It's not me.

1042
01:01:19.223 --> 01:01:21.022
-
-It's not Ethan.

1043
01:01:21.024 --> 01:01:23.558
We both know how to land
on our feet. And it's not you.


1044
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.627
-You're so young.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.


1045
01:01:25.629 --> 01:01:28.630
There's one person... one
person who will be destroyed,


1046
01:01:28.632 --> 01:01:30.298
and we both know who that is.

1047
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.067
What do you think's
gonna happen?


1048
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:34.035
You think you can get married,
you think you can have


1049
01:01:34.037 --> 01:01:36.204
the obligatory second family
and live happily ever after


1050
01:01:36.206 --> 01:01:37.606
in your dream world?

1051
01:01:37.608 --> 01:01:40.175
Well, obviously
that can't happen.


1052
01:01:40.177 --> 01:01:43.511
What is that supposed to mean?

1053
01:01:43.513 --> 01:01:45.580
-Wait, what is that
supposed to mean? -Hey.


1054
01:01:45.582 --> 01:01:47.582
What is it supposed to mean?

1055
01:01:47.584 --> 01:01:49.317
Stop it.

1056
01:01:52.922 --> 01:01:55.390
-Stop it, Thomas. Come on.
-I'm gonna tell him everything.


1057
01:01:55.392 --> 01:01:58.126
-I'm gonna tell him. Don't...
-Thomas.


1058
01:02:49.512 --> 01:02:51.112
Thomas!

1059
01:02:53.115 --> 01:02:56.051
Thomas, what are you doing?

1060
01:02:56.053 --> 01:02:57.252
It's raining.

1061
01:03:02.158 --> 01:03:04.125
Um...

1062
01:03:04.127 --> 01:03:05.527
Okay.

1063
01:03:07.663 --> 01:03:09.431
I...

1064
01:03:09.433 --> 01:03:12.400
I broke up with Nick...

1065
01:03:12.402 --> 01:03:15.403
Because I got into Croatia.

1066
01:03:16.605 --> 01:03:19.441
And I want you to come with me.

1067
01:03:30.019 --> 01:03:32.153
I slept with Johanna.

1068
01:03:34.423 --> 01:03:35.724
No.

1069
01:03:35.726 --> 01:03:39.194
You're not like that.

1070
01:03:39.196 --> 01:03:42.197
-And I thought that I was
in love with her. -Mm-mm.


1071
01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:46.468
You're good.

1072
01:03:50.773 --> 01:03:53.174
No, Mimi, I'm not good.

1073
01:03:59.081 --> 01:04:00.448
Mimi!

1074
01:04:01.584 --> 01:04:03.184
Mimi!

1075
01:04:10.092 --> 01:04:12.527
I'm sorry.

1076
01:04:12.529 --> 01:04:15.730
You are just like them.

1077
01:04:15.732 --> 01:04:17.732
They won, Thomas.

1078
01:04:17.734 --> 01:04:20.335
God, they've fucking
bankrupted you.


1079
01:05:39.683 --> 01:05:42.117
-Hey. -Thomas!
Did you spend last night here?


1080
01:05:42.119 --> 01:05:43.785
Yeah.

1081
01:05:43.787 --> 01:05:47.822
Well, that was the best party
that Kenta has thrown in years.


1082
01:05:47.824 --> 01:05:50.492
Everybody was drunk-- and
not just our alcoholic friends,


1083
01:05:50.494 --> 01:05:52.427
but everybody.

1084
01:05:52.429 --> 01:05:54.596
- Why did you spend the night?

1085
01:05:54.598 --> 01:05:56.598
I don't know.

1086
01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.435
I just... wanted to come home.

1087
01:06:00.437 --> 01:06:02.437
Are you upset?

1088
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.841
Tell me about it.

1089
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:11.446
What?

1090
01:06:11.448 --> 01:06:13.715
Is it about a girl?

1091
01:06:13.717 --> 01:06:16.885
And I'm your mother, so...

1092
01:06:16.887 --> 01:06:19.587
Things have gotten messy,
and...


1093
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:21.723
I want to bail.

1094
01:06:23.626 --> 01:06:26.728
But I can't.

1095
01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:28.730
Well, then you know.

1096
01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.337
The only way out... is through.

1097
01:06:36.339 --> 01:06:37.872
Right?

1098
01:06:39.942 --> 01:06:41.743
Where's dad?

1099
01:06:41.745 --> 01:06:43.611
He left early.

1100
01:06:43.613 --> 01:06:46.748
He said he had to go to
the office and get some files.


1101
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:50.351
He seems to have
gotten over what a...


1102
01:07:08.537 --> 01:07:10.538
Thomas?

1103
01:07:18.514 --> 01:07:20.915
-Dad?
-Thomas. Huh.


1104
01:07:20.917 --> 01:07:22.817
-We need to talk.
-Mm-hmm.


1105
01:07:22.819 --> 01:07:24.519
There are...
There are some things


1106
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:25.787
-that you don't know that...
-Thomas, don't.


1107
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:27.789
-Don't.
-...That you need to know.


1108
01:07:29.825 --> 01:07:32.860
Johanna.

1109
01:07:32.862 --> 01:07:34.996
You two know each other?

1110
01:07:34.998 --> 01:07:36.531
Yeah.

1111
01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:40.535
What?

1112
01:07:40.537 --> 01:07:42.470
Well, Ethan,
the thing is, is that...


1113
01:07:42.472 --> 01:07:43.871
He followed me.

1114
01:07:43.873 --> 01:07:46.341
You followed her?

1115
01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.811
That's not all I did.

1116
01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:58.586
I'm sorry, I...

1117
01:07:58.588 --> 01:07:59.988
I don't understand.

1118
01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:07.562
We slept together.

1119
01:08:07.564 --> 01:08:09.897
And not just once.

1120
01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:13.835
What?

1121
01:08:33.056 --> 01:08:35.657
You slick little shit, you!

1122
01:08:35.659 --> 01:08:37.525
-I did right by you!
-No, relax!


1123
01:08:37.527 --> 01:08:38.926
-You have no idea!
-Relax!


1124
01:08:38.928 --> 01:08:40.762
You have no idea!

1125
01:08:51.507 --> 01:08:53.474
Oh.

1126
01:08:59.482 --> 01:09:00.748
Oh.

1127
01:09:12.928 --> 01:09:14.929
I deserve you.

1128
01:09:44.393 --> 01:09:46.728
-
-I'm sorry.

1129
01:09:48.731 --> 01:09:50.732
We're all sorry, Thomas.

1130
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:55.670
I really do love him.

1131
01:10:03.847 --> 01:10:06.414
And he did right by you.

1132
01:10:08.417 --> 01:10:10.151
More than you know.

1133
01:10:15.691 --> 01:10:18.092
Good-bye, Thomas.

1134
01:11:32.035 --> 01:11:34.035
Did you finish it?

1135
01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:39.640
I did.

1136
01:11:39.642 --> 01:11:41.642
Tell me about it.

1137
01:11:45.514 --> 01:11:48.649
Tell me about "the only
living boy in New York."


1138
01:11:53.989 --> 01:11:56.657
Uh, well...

1139
01:12:02.565 --> 01:12:05.800
It's about three people--
artists...


1140
01:12:05.802 --> 01:12:07.802
And great friends.

1141
01:12:10.205 --> 01:12:13.708
One of them is
a beautiful young girl.


1142
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:15.243
The other two...

1143
01:12:15.245 --> 01:12:18.246
One artist has talent,
the other doesn't.


1144
01:12:18.248 --> 01:12:20.848
You know,
no matter how hard he tries,


1145
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:23.217
and no matter
how badly he wants it,


1146
01:12:23.219 --> 01:12:25.686
he just...

1147
01:12:25.688 --> 01:12:27.989
Well, he wasn't kissed by god
in that way.


1148
01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:30.124
But he has the girl.

1149
01:12:30.126 --> 01:12:33.694
Yes. And they're married,

1150
01:12:33.696 --> 01:12:37.265
and they plan
to start a family.


1151
01:12:37.267 --> 01:12:40.234
Only they have
a little problem.


1152
01:12:40.236 --> 01:12:42.904
He's infertile.

1153
01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:45.840
And they ask
their talented friend for help?


1154
01:12:47.843 --> 01:12:50.578
Yeah, you have a knack
for a story, Thomas.


1155
01:12:52.014 --> 01:12:54.615
I get it from my father.

1156
01:12:54.617 --> 01:12:56.117
Uh-huh.

1157
01:13:05.627 --> 01:13:07.728
So...

1158
01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:12.133
So, they're artists, and they
don't want to use in vitro,


1159
01:13:12.135 --> 01:13:15.136
so they go with
a cheap bottle of cabernet


1160
01:13:15.138 --> 01:13:18.806
and, uh, some quaaludes
and a Simon & Garfunkel record,


1161
01:13:18.808 --> 01:13:20.808
and the three of them decide...

1162
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.678
And-and... the husband's
okay with that?


1163
01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.614
Well, th-they want to use
somebody that they know,


1164
01:13:26.616 --> 01:13:29.083
somebody that they love.

1165
01:13:29.085 --> 01:13:33.287
Well, and, of course,
the artist with the talent,


1166
01:13:33.289 --> 01:13:37.892
he's, uh, he's flattered,
and, of course, he agrees.


1167
01:13:39.795 --> 01:13:42.330
And, uh, he and the...

1168
01:13:42.332 --> 01:13:44.832
The beautiful girl...

1169
01:13:49.238 --> 01:13:51.639
...they...

1170
01:13:51.641 --> 01:13:54.976
Uh, they walk the city streets
that night...


1171
01:13:54.978 --> 01:13:56.243
For hours.

1172
01:13:56.245 --> 01:13:59.680
They're both so damn nervous.

1173
01:13:59.682 --> 01:14:03.184
And they end up
at Washington Square park...


1174
01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.823
...where they dance...

1175
01:14:08.825 --> 01:14:12.793
Uh... to no music.

1176
01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:17.798
And the rest comes easy.

1177
01:14:20.937 --> 01:14:22.803
And does he love her?

1178
01:14:22.805 --> 01:14:26.674
Yeah, he... he does. Mm.

1179
01:14:26.676 --> 01:14:29.677
In that moment,
he realizes he does.


1180
01:14:36.952 --> 01:14:39.954
Uh, so it turns out that...

1181
01:14:39.956 --> 01:14:44.091
That the beautiful girl,

1182
01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:46.260
she gives birth
to a wonderful son,


1183
01:14:46.262 --> 01:14:50.131
and her husband gives up art,

1184
01:14:50.133 --> 01:14:53.000
becomes a very successful
art dealer.


1185
01:14:53.002 --> 01:14:56.003
And the other artist?

1186
01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:03.244
He watches the boy grow
from afar, huh?


1187
01:15:05.013 --> 01:15:08.015
Sees his own talent alive
in this child.


1188
01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:17.058
He so desperately wants
to connect with his son...


1189
01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.060
And tell him everything.

1190
01:15:23.198 --> 01:15:26.200
And nurture
his talent, you know?


1191
01:15:34.409 --> 01:15:37.878
But, of course,
he never does make contact.


1192
01:15:40.882 --> 01:15:43.751
Until...

1193
01:15:43.753 --> 01:15:47.021
Until he decides
to make it all his next book.


1194
01:16:02.037 --> 01:16:04.038
-
-It's okay.

1195
01:16:23.525 --> 01:16:25.059
Mom.

1196
01:16:33.268 --> 01:16:35.269
Thomas.

1197
01:16:37.472 --> 01:16:39.106
What did he tell you?

1198
01:16:39.108 --> 01:16:41.475
Everything.

1199
01:16:44.079 --> 01:16:46.080
You here looking for razors?

1200
01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:48.082
Empty pill bottles?

1201
01:16:50.519 --> 01:16:52.219
Sit down.

1202
01:17:00.095 --> 01:17:02.863
What do you know, Thomas?

1203
01:17:02.865 --> 01:17:06.100
I know...

1204
01:17:06.102 --> 01:17:08.269
I know why you carry
so much guilt.


1205
01:17:11.506 --> 01:17:13.841
I know that I...

1206
01:17:13.843 --> 01:17:15.843
Already forgive you.

1207
01:17:15.845 --> 01:17:17.278
I know you're in love
with someone


1208
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.380
you haven't seen
in over 25 years.


1209
01:17:19.382 --> 01:17:22.449
And you go to Riverside Park
every day to read his books.


1210
01:17:22.451 --> 01:17:25.419
I know.
I know, and it's okay.


1211
01:17:29.124 --> 01:17:31.392
-Who told you?
-He did.


1212
01:17:31.394 --> 01:17:33.127
Julian. W.F.

1213
01:17:33.129 --> 01:17:35.062
Whatever you want to call him.

1214
01:17:35.064 --> 01:17:37.531
Is he dying?

1215
01:17:38.568 --> 01:17:40.267
He's not dying.

1216
01:17:40.269 --> 01:17:43.137
- No?
-Don't worry, he's not dying.


1217
01:17:43.139 --> 01:17:45.306
He's fine. He's just...

1218
01:17:45.308 --> 01:17:47.041
I don't know, he's tired.

1219
01:17:47.043 --> 01:17:48.609
Think he's lonely.

1220
01:17:50.612 --> 01:17:53.614
It was my idea
not to tell you, not Ethan's.


1221
01:17:53.616 --> 01:17:56.016
-You have to know that.
-Okay.


1222
01:17:56.018 --> 01:17:58.052
You were trying to protect me.

1223
01:17:58.054 --> 01:18:00.588
Yes, and...

1224
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:03.591
And I knew that
if you found out,


1225
01:18:03.593 --> 01:18:05.459
he would
come back into my life,


1226
01:18:05.461 --> 01:18:07.561
and then everything
would go to shit.


1227
01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:10.097
Well, everything went to shit
on its own, so...


1228
01:18:12.334 --> 01:18:14.201
Yeah, I guess.

1229
01:18:25.046 --> 01:18:27.314
Is he old?

1230
01:18:29.484 --> 01:18:30.918
He's messy.

1231
01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.455
Yeah, he always was.

1232
01:18:34.457 --> 01:18:36.457
An unmade bed of a man.

1233
01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:39.927
"An unmade bed of a man."

1234
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:42.930
I like that.

1235
01:18:42.932 --> 01:18:45.065
You should.

1236
01:18:45.067 --> 01:18:47.668
Your father wrote it.

1237
01:19:22.238 --> 01:19:23.671
We're closed.

1238
01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:28.542
I'm sorry, I thought
I locked the door.


1239
01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:38.118
-Hey.
-Hey.


1240
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.120
I'll be quick.

1241
01:19:40.122 --> 01:19:41.522
I know what book I want.

1242
01:19:41.524 --> 01:19:42.723
Sure.

1243
01:19:47.663 --> 01:19:49.196
Hmm.

1244
01:19:49.198 --> 01:19:52.433
What'd you think?

1245
01:19:52.435 --> 01:19:54.435
Serviceable.

1246
01:19:56.038 --> 01:19:58.138
You're lying
to make me feel good.


1247
01:20:00.175 --> 01:20:03.277
Character that surprised me
the most was the father.


1248
01:20:07.549 --> 01:20:09.149
Which one?

1249
01:20:11.019 --> 01:20:13.187
The one that didn't run away.

1250
01:20:19.027 --> 01:20:20.361
Whatever happened to Mimi?

1251
01:20:20.363 --> 01:20:22.096
She's still in Croatia.

1252
01:20:22.098 --> 01:20:23.464
She got a fellowship.

1253
01:20:23.466 --> 01:20:25.632
I don't think
she's coming back.


1254
01:20:25.634 --> 01:20:28.335
Oh.

1255
01:20:28.337 --> 01:20:30.337
Did you hear back from Viking?

1256
01:20:30.339 --> 01:20:32.172
Yeah, it was a pass.

1257
01:20:32.174 --> 01:20:34.108
I'm sorry.

1258
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.443
You want me to make
a few phone calls?


1259
01:20:38.446 --> 01:20:40.447
No.

1260
01:20:40.449 --> 01:20:42.316
I want to start something new.

1261
01:20:42.318 --> 01:20:44.118
I ha... have an idea.

1262
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.187
Well, that's good.

1263
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:49.189
You still speaking to Johanna?

1264
01:20:49.191 --> 01:20:50.591
No.

1265
01:20:53.228 --> 01:20:55.229
-You lying to me?
-Yeah.


1266
01:20:57.733 --> 01:20:59.233
-How's your mother?
-She's good.


1267
01:20:59.235 --> 01:21:01.402
She quit smoking.

1268
01:21:01.404 --> 01:21:03.737
Started writing
for<i>Artnews</i> again.


1269
01:21:03.739 --> 01:21:05.472
-That's good.
-Yeah.


1270
01:21:05.474 --> 01:21:07.074
She has a date tonight.

1271
01:21:07.076 --> 01:21:09.076
Oh, good for her.

1272
01:21:10.745 --> 01:21:12.379
- Truly.

1273
01:21:14.382 --> 01:21:16.083
"The best lack all conviction,

1274
01:21:16.085 --> 01:21:19.153
while the worst are full of
passionate intensity."


1275
