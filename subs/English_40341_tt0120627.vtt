1
00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:57.633
Mommy?

2
00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.958
Mommy?

3
00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:45.420
How many times do
I have to tell you?


4
00:03:45.463 --> 00:03:49.641
Louis, what are you doing?

5
00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:51.121
I ask for a meal...

6
00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:51.992
Stop it.

7
00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:53.036
I won't stop it!

8
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.561
Louis, please!

9
00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.783
Stop it!

10
00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:03.133
You're hurting me!

11
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.746
What's wrong with you?

12
00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:15.058
Nothin'.

13
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.756
Here's something new?

14
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.584
Stop it!

15
00:04:19.628 --> 00:04:20.759
Stop it!

16
00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:22.370
Come on!

17
00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:24.807
Stop it!
Stop it!


18
00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:35.687
You're a bitch.

19
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:37.602
Leave her alone!

20
00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:40.823
Stop it, Louis!
Leave us all alone!


21
00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:43.739
Please don't hurt my mommy.

22
00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:20.732
Alex, I gotta go.

23
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:28.958
Sid's got the bar, OK?

24
00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:31.047
Yeah.

25
00:05:34.137 --> 00:05:38.098
I forgot it was today.

26
00:05:38.707 --> 00:05:40.491
Don't you need a jacket?

27
00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:42.145
I'm fine.

28
00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.453
Don't worry about me so much.

29
00:05:47.542 --> 00:05:48.804
Bye.

30
00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:50.762
Have fun.

31
00:05:50.806 --> 00:05:52.851
Yeah.

32
00:07:56.584 --> 00:07:58.455
You all right?

33
00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:01.110
Come here.

34
00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:03.982
There we go.
Feel better?


35
00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:06.724
All right.

36
00:08:06.768 --> 00:08:08.596
Now, open up.

37
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:12.513
Open up, there we go.

38
00:08:12.556 --> 00:08:14.254
Now tell me, Alex...

39
00:08:14.297 --> 00:08:16.212
Did you miss me?

40
00:08:16.256 --> 00:08:19.128
Come on. We're going to a party.

41
00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:22.827
It is the anniversary
of your mother's death.


42
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:24.786
I suggest you start driving.

43
00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:27.832
I don't know how long
I'll be able to stay inside


44
00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:29.965
without pulling the trigger.

45
00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:32.097
All right, then.
Just drive.


46
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:34.535
Go on.

47
00:08:47.199 --> 00:08:48.549
You've really grown up.

48
00:08:48.592 --> 00:08:52.335
Turned into quite the lady,
very mature.


49
00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:55.599
And very sexy.

50
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.472
Wait a minute...

51
00:08:58.515 --> 00:08:59.821
This is new.

52
00:08:59.864 --> 00:09:02.127
I'll bet you got
all the boys dreaming


53
00:09:02.171 --> 00:09:04.956
about trying to get
their hands on these?


54
00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:09.047
The things you could tell them?

55
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:13.008
The things I could tell them?

56
00:09:13.356 --> 00:09:16.403
Now, 20 years is a long time
in between drinks,


57
00:09:16.446 --> 00:09:20.450
but I'll bet you haven't
forgotten about me.


58
00:09:21.886 --> 00:09:23.627
Well, I'm trying to forget, too.

59
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:27.501
Forget and forgive,
forgive and forget.


60
00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:31.331
You can turn right at the light.

61
00:09:39.904 --> 00:09:42.472
Where the fuck are we going?

62
00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:43.517
Don't curse!

63
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.215
It cheapens both of us!

64
00:09:46.258 --> 00:09:50.393
Where are we going?
A familiar place.


65
00:09:50.437 --> 00:09:54.179
You know,
jail is a great place to think, Alex.


66
00:09:54.223 --> 00:09:55.529
And I must say,

67
00:09:55.572 --> 00:09:59.446
not a day went by when
I didn't think about you.


68
00:09:59.489 --> 00:10:03.319
I just knew we'd work
it all out someday.


69
00:10:03.363 --> 00:10:07.758
'Cause I never hold a grudge
once I get even.


70
00:10:10.848 --> 00:10:12.546
Right, boys?

71
00:10:15.723 --> 00:10:18.856
You just take us down there
to the old fun house.


72
00:10:19.466 --> 00:10:23.470
There is one thing
I regret, though.


73
00:10:23.513 --> 00:10:25.080
What's that?

74
00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:27.563
I regret you're not going to
be around for the grand finale...


75
00:10:27.588 --> 00:10:29.258
The maddest of tea parties.

76
00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:31.478
You always were
the showman, Louis.


77
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:34.437
It's gonna be quite a show,
I promise you.


78
00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:36.439
And the best part...

79
00:10:36.483 --> 00:10:40.400
Is what I'm gonna do with that
little cupcake sister of yours.


80
00:10:40.443 --> 00:10:42.271
You stay away from her.

81
00:10:42.314 --> 00:10:45.274
"You stay away from her!"

82
00:10:45.317 --> 00:10:47.711
Well, I can't do that.

83
00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:49.452
I'm sorry you won't
be there to see it,


84
00:10:49.496 --> 00:10:53.978
but we've all got to
make our little sacrifices.


85
00:10:54.022 --> 00:10:57.068
Know what I mean?

86
00:10:57.939 --> 00:10:59.331
Yeah.

87
00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:01.638
I think I do.

88
00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:09.037
Showtime.

89
00:11:40.024 --> 00:11:42.897
What's going on in there?

90
00:11:46.074 --> 00:11:48.206
Come on, Alex, what's going on?

91
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.427
Alex, you're flooding
the whole damn place.


92
00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:54.343
I must have fallen asleep.

93
00:11:54.386 --> 00:11:56.258
Did it seep through?

94
00:11:56.301 --> 00:11:57.433
Hell, yeah, Alex...

95
00:11:57.477 --> 00:11:59.157
That's why I've been
banging the door down.


96
00:11:59.182 --> 00:12:02.795
Look at this.
What a mess.


97
00:12:28.725 --> 00:12:30.118
What a nightmare.

98
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:31.685
Yeah, well, shit happens.

99
00:12:31.728 --> 00:12:35.732
I just don't see why it needs to
happen around here so much.


100
00:12:38.866 --> 00:12:39.780
Where's Sandra?

101
00:12:39.823 --> 00:12:41.695
Said she had some singing thing.

102
00:12:41.738 --> 00:12:44.654
Left in a big hurry.

103
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:49.006
I'm sure of that.

104
00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:53.097
Hey, sweetheart...

105
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:55.143
How about exercisin'
those great legs of yours


106
00:12:55.186 --> 00:12:58.146
and bringin' a fresh beer
for an old man?


107
00:12:58.189 --> 00:13:00.670
Tell you what...

108
00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:06.110
How about an old beer
for a fresh man?


109
00:13:07.024 --> 00:13:08.722
That beer's not so old.

110
00:13:08.765 --> 00:13:10.245
By the way,
where's your partner?


111
00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:12.247
Don't know.
She's supposed to be here.


112
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.380
Maybe she thought we
could use some time alone.


113
00:13:15.424 --> 00:13:21.473
Yeah, and maybe Alex might
let us drink for free all night.


114
00:13:21.517 --> 00:13:23.780
Maybe.

115
00:13:24.476 --> 00:13:27.044
And unlikely.

116
00:13:27.088 --> 00:13:29.569
Hey, which one's the maybe?

117
00:13:42.843 --> 00:13:45.193
Alex, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.


118
00:13:45.236 --> 00:13:46.150
Hey!

119
00:13:46.194 --> 00:13:47.891
Yo, chill!

120
00:13:47.935 --> 00:13:49.632
Did you have a nice afternoon?

121
00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:50.633
Oh, please.

122
00:13:50.677 --> 00:13:52.504
They were running
two hours late.


123
00:13:52.548 --> 00:13:53.810
I was gonna blow it off,

124
00:13:53.854 --> 00:13:54.855
and then they called me.

125
00:13:54.898 --> 00:13:56.298
Do you know how
to use one of these?


126
00:13:56.334 --> 00:13:59.860
You pick it up, dial,
listen for the ringing sound...


127
00:13:59.903 --> 00:14:01.775
Alex...

128
00:14:01.818 --> 00:14:02.993
I was gonna call you. I was.

129
00:14:03.037 --> 00:14:05.692
But there was one
phone in the whole place,


130
00:14:05.735 --> 00:14:06.693
I swear.

131
00:14:09.304 --> 00:14:12.089
You've got customers.

132
00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:14.962
Hello, customers.

133
00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:39.116
Well, good night, ladies.

134
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.770
You leaving, Sid?
Yup.


135
00:14:40.814 --> 00:14:41.684
I'll miss you.

136
00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:43.033
See you tomorrow.

137
00:14:43.077 --> 00:14:44.121
Get some sleep.

138
00:14:44.165 --> 00:14:44.992
You, too.

139
00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:47.951
Hey... try a bed this time.

140
00:14:51.172 --> 00:14:54.566
I heard you had quite a bath today,
Alex.


141
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.873
I was having that
nightmare again.


142
00:14:56.917 --> 00:14:58.179
You were?

143
00:14:58.222 --> 00:15:01.573
Well,
now we just have one more thing to fix


144
00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:05.577
before we sell this taco stand.

145
00:15:05.621 --> 00:15:07.971
I'm doing everything I
can to fix this place up


146
00:15:08.015 --> 00:15:10.191
so we can get out of here.

147
00:15:10.234 --> 00:15:13.890
Well, maybe the first
part of that's true.


148
00:15:13.934 --> 00:15:15.094
What's that supposed to mean?

149
00:15:15.138 --> 00:15:16.738
What it means is that
you've been talking


150
00:15:16.763 --> 00:15:18.721
about getting us out
of here for a while.


151
00:15:18.765 --> 00:15:22.986
I'm sorry you had a bad dream.

152
00:15:26.947 --> 00:15:29.384
Good night.

153
00:15:29.427 --> 00:15:31.908
I love you.

154
00:16:42.152 --> 00:16:43.284
Watch your step.

155
00:16:43.327 --> 00:16:45.721
It's a little slippery
on the bottom.


156
00:16:45.765 --> 00:16:47.070
How bad is it?

157
00:16:47.114 --> 00:16:49.246
You'll see.

158
00:16:53.773 --> 00:16:55.687
Shit.

159
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.240
Hello?

160
00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:29.765
Hello?

161
00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:32.768
Ma'am?

162
00:17:39.296 --> 00:17:41.429
Can I help you?

163
00:17:45.389 --> 00:17:47.696
Mercer, sit.

164
00:17:51.831 --> 00:17:53.615
I need a pump.

165
00:17:53.658 --> 00:17:57.140
Oh, don't we all?

166
00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:01.797
You local?

167
00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:03.755
Yeah.

168
00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:06.410
Well, where do you live?

169
00:18:06.454 --> 00:18:08.499
The old mermaid inn,

170
00:18:08.543 --> 00:18:09.674
just down the road a bit.

171
00:18:09.718 --> 00:18:11.720
I've got a flood in my basement.

172
00:18:11.763 --> 00:18:16.246
Do you have a pump or
something that I could rent?


173
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.682
Oh, yeah.

174
00:18:17.726 --> 00:18:23.253
I-I'm sure I've got something
lying around out back.


175
00:18:39.617 --> 00:18:42.751
Would that do it for you, then?

176
00:18:42.794 --> 00:18:44.753
Yeah.

177
00:18:45.101 --> 00:18:46.842
And this.

178
00:18:51.499 --> 00:18:56.373
Did you say you were
from the old mermaid bar?


179
00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:58.114
Yes.

180
00:19:01.422 --> 00:19:03.598
Funny...

181
00:19:03.641 --> 00:19:07.732
I thought they closed
that place down.


182
00:19:07.776 --> 00:19:08.733
No.

183
00:19:08.777 --> 00:19:12.302
Not yet, anyway.

184
00:19:28.623 --> 00:19:30.190
Hey, is your car dirty?

185
00:19:30.233 --> 00:19:32.888
Well, if it is, you come on down
to Cal's car wash, all right?


186
00:19:34.368 --> 00:19:40.896

188
00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:56.999
Well, howdy.
Welcome to Cal's.


189
00:19:57.043 --> 00:19:58.522
Have we got a special today.

190
00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:01.612
Our executive car wash
is only $12.99.


191
00:20:01.656 --> 00:20:03.049
Just fluff and fold.

192
00:20:03.092 --> 00:20:04.659
You know, for only
an extra dollar


193
00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:07.102
you can get the hot wax and
the super deluxe vinyl treatment.


194
00:20:07.127 --> 00:20:08.228
No thanks.

195
00:20:08.271 --> 00:20:09.551
Well, you seem like a nice girl.

196
00:20:09.595 --> 00:20:10.915
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do...


197
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.621
I'm gonna throw it in for free.

Hello, Alex!

I'm Louis.

208
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.139
You're not here at the
carnival by yourself, are you?


209
00:26:38.182 --> 00:26:41.229
I lost my mommy.

210
00:26:41.795 --> 00:26:44.624
Lost your mommy?

211
00:26:45.189 --> 00:26:46.408
Well...

212
00:26:46.452 --> 00:26:51.065
I'm sure she's
around here somewhere.


213
00:26:51.892 --> 00:26:53.546
Wanna go to the fun house?

214
00:26:53.589 --> 00:26:55.025
It's fun.

215
00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:57.419
Thank god... there you are!

216
00:26:57.463 --> 00:26:59.682
Honey, I've been looking
all over for you.


217
00:26:59.726 --> 00:27:02.032
You can't just
wander off like that.


218
00:27:02.076 --> 00:27:06.254
Are you OK, sweetheart?

219
00:27:06.863 --> 00:27:08.778
You must be mommy.

220
00:27:08.822 --> 00:27:10.519
Elaine.

221
00:27:13.696 --> 00:27:15.350
Don't be too hard on her.

222
00:27:15.394 --> 00:27:17.831
We were just gonna come
looking for you.


223
00:27:17.874 --> 00:27:19.180
Ain't that right, Alex?

224
00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:20.573
I was terribly worried.

225
00:27:20.616 --> 00:27:22.662
I just turned around for
a minute, and she was gone.


226
00:27:22.705 --> 00:27:25.665
It's so hard to keep track
of two little ones.


227
00:27:25.708 --> 00:27:29.320
Well,
you can't be expected to do it all alone.


228
00:27:29.364 --> 00:27:31.192
Where's daddy tonight?

229
00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:35.979
Daddy's where the balloons fly.

230
00:27:36.284 --> 00:27:38.242
Well, hello there.

231
00:27:38.286 --> 00:27:39.940
What's your name?

232
00:27:39.983 --> 00:27:41.115
Sandra.

233
00:27:41.158 --> 00:27:43.291
Well, Sandra,

234
00:27:43.334 --> 00:27:45.467
if your daddy's
with the balloons,


235
00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:49.036
I bet he's having
a wonderful time.


236
00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:50.603
Do you like balloons?

237
00:27:50.646 --> 00:27:52.692
No.

238
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.826
She doesn't like balloons.

239
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:58.132
Honey!

240
00:27:58.175 --> 00:28:01.962
Well, thank you
for finding Alex.


241
00:28:02.005 --> 00:28:07.141
Actually, I didn't find her.

242
00:28:07.184 --> 00:28:10.274
She found me.

243
00:28:11.841 --> 00:28:12.842
Gotcha!

244
00:28:12.886 --> 00:28:16.455
Well, either way,
I'm very grateful.


245
00:28:16.498 --> 00:28:18.848
Then perhaps you'd let me
buy you a drink sometime?


246
00:28:18.892 --> 00:28:22.243
I tell you what...
I run the mermaid bar


247
00:28:22.286 --> 00:28:23.679
a few miles down the road.

248
00:28:23.723 --> 00:28:27.204
Why don't you come by
and I'll buy you a drink?


249
00:28:27.248 --> 00:28:30.164
It would be my pleasure.

250
00:28:30.817 --> 00:28:33.167
Enjoy the rest of the carnival.

251
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.386
And remember...

252
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.999
The fun is just beginning.

253
00:29:02.152 --> 00:29:04.546
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.


254
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.635
Are you looking for someone?

255
00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:08.245
No, I was just...

256
00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:10.421
Just looking.

257
00:29:10.465 --> 00:29:13.686
Yeah. I used to come here
when I was a kid.


258
00:29:13.729 --> 00:29:15.296
Are you a cop?

259
00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:17.080
No, no, not really.

260
00:29:17.124 --> 00:29:18.952
But I am in charge of
patrolling this property


261
00:29:18.995 --> 00:29:22.651
and technically
you are trespassing.


262
00:29:22.695 --> 00:29:24.958
I'm sorry.
I was just...


263
00:29:25.001 --> 00:29:26.350
Don't sweat it.

264
00:29:26.394 --> 00:29:29.789
It'll be our little secret.

265
00:29:30.877 --> 00:29:32.574
Nice boat.

266
00:29:33.096 --> 00:29:34.141
Thanks.

267
00:29:34.184 --> 00:29:35.882
It's not much,
but it gets me around.


268
00:29:35.925 --> 00:29:37.492
Would you like to go for a ride?

269
00:29:37.536 --> 00:29:41.061
No, I really don't
like the water.


270
00:29:41.104 --> 00:29:42.497
A harbor's a funny place to live

271
00:29:42.541 --> 00:29:46.588
for someone who doesn't
like the water.


272
00:29:46.632 --> 00:29:47.850
I'm Michael.

273
00:29:47.894 --> 00:29:48.982
Alex.

274
00:29:49.025 --> 00:29:51.941
Alex.

275
00:29:51.985 --> 00:29:55.379
Well, Alex, maybe sometime
you'll let me take you for a ride.


276
00:29:55.423 --> 00:29:57.294
Maybe I will.

277
00:29:57.338 --> 00:30:00.515
Until we meet again.

278
00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:03.605
Will we?

279
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:06.216
I think we might.

280
00:30:51.348 --> 00:30:52.698
Hey there.

281
00:30:52.741 --> 00:30:54.003
Hey.

282
00:30:54.047 --> 00:30:56.658
I got some spackle
for the ceiling.


283
00:30:56.702 --> 00:30:58.834
And a pump for the cellar.

284
00:30:58.878 --> 00:31:00.619
There's no leak in the bathroom.

285
00:31:00.662 --> 00:31:02.382
I don't know where
that water's coming from.


286
00:31:02.407 --> 00:31:06.625
It does look like I'm gonna
have to do some spackling.


287
00:31:06.668 --> 00:31:08.757
I appreciate it.

288
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:10.150
Things under control here?

289
00:31:10.193 --> 00:31:13.240
Yeah, yeah,
it's pretty dead in here tonight.


290
00:31:13.283 --> 00:31:14.589
Wait a minute...

291
00:31:14.633 --> 00:31:17.287
You left it at the bar
last night.


292
00:31:17.331 --> 00:31:18.506
I did?

293
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:19.725
Yeah. Left it in the tip jar,

294
00:31:19.768 --> 00:31:22.162
told me to hang on
to it for you.


295
00:31:22.205 --> 00:31:24.860
I... don't remember.

296
00:31:24.904 --> 00:31:26.079
Well, thanks.

297
00:31:26.122 --> 00:31:27.950
Yeah, no problem.
Hey...


298
00:31:27.994 --> 00:31:29.778
You OK?

299
00:31:29.822 --> 00:31:32.085
Yeah. Fine.

300
00:32:06.989 --> 00:32:08.774
You could bottle that stuff

301
00:32:08.817 --> 00:32:10.776
and sell shots of it for a buck.

302
00:32:10.819 --> 00:32:13.996
I know at least a couple
of people who would try it.


303
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.131
Yeah, but then they'd
want it all the time.


304
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.080
So it looks like they
might be setting up


305
00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.223
the old carnival out there?

306
00:32:23.266 --> 00:32:25.268
I doubt it.

307
00:32:25.312 --> 00:32:30.143
There hasn't been a carnival
out there in over 20 years.


308
00:33:06.396 --> 00:33:08.224
Sid?

309
00:33:16.842 --> 00:33:18.974
Who's there?

310
00:33:29.985 --> 00:33:32.771
Who's there?

311
00:33:45.784 --> 00:33:47.524
No...

312
00:33:48.787 --> 00:33:50.484
No what?

313
00:33:52.878 --> 00:33:55.315
Nothing.

314
00:34:53.895 --> 00:34:56.115
Wanna know what
little girls are made of?


315
00:34:56.158 --> 00:35:01.294
Sugar and spice
and everything nice.


316
00:35:08.518 --> 00:35:09.171
Get away!

317
00:35:09.215 --> 00:35:11.913
Alex! Stop!
It's me!


318
00:35:11.957 --> 00:35:13.219
It's me.

319
00:35:13.262 --> 00:35:15.961
I was washing my face.

320
00:35:21.053 --> 00:35:22.532
I couldn't breathe.

321
00:35:22.576 --> 00:35:26.232
Can you breathe now?

322
00:36:13.322 --> 00:36:16.238
Where did this come from?

323
00:36:16.282 --> 00:36:17.544
Told you...

324
00:36:17.587 --> 00:36:19.467
I know what you told me.
Where did it come from?


325
00:36:19.492 --> 00:36:22.375
I don't know, Alex.
I never saw it before last night.


326
00:36:22.418 --> 00:36:24.812
You didn't see anybody
leave it on the bar?


327
00:36:24.855 --> 00:36:26.901
Nobody handed it to you?

328
00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:29.817
Yes. You did.

329
00:36:32.602 --> 00:36:34.865
Is it bad?

330
00:36:35.954 --> 00:36:39.479
I don't know what it is.

331
00:36:46.007 --> 00:36:49.706
How'd you like to drink
for free tonight?


332
00:36:51.752 --> 00:36:55.625
Sounds like you need a favor.

333
00:36:56.278 --> 00:36:58.585
I do.

334
00:37:00.587 --> 00:37:02.763
This the guy?

335
00:37:02.806 --> 00:37:04.634
Yeah, that's him.

336
00:37:04.678 --> 00:37:05.896
You sure?

337
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.202
Positive.

338
00:37:07.246 --> 00:37:11.119
You went through this
pretty carefully.


339
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.256
Oh, yeah.
He was quite a charmer.


340
00:37:17.299 --> 00:37:22.739
Had numerous arrests for
questionable behavior around children.


341
00:37:22.783 --> 00:37:24.524
And quite a penchant
for little girls.


342
00:37:24.567 --> 00:37:30.399
Managed to stay out of reach by
moving from one carnival to the next...


343
00:37:30.443 --> 00:37:34.621
That is until he was convicted
of rape and murder in 1977


344
00:37:34.664 --> 00:37:37.841
and sentenced to life in prison.

345
00:37:37.885 --> 00:37:38.929
Yeah, I know that.

346
00:37:38.973 --> 00:37:40.409
I'm sure you do.

347
00:37:40.453 --> 00:37:43.934
The report says it was your
testimony that put him away.


348
00:37:43.978 --> 00:37:48.156
That's quite a lot to
handle for a 12-year-old.


349
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.332
I was 11.

350
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.469
He served his term in folsom

351
00:37:56.512 --> 00:38:00.168
and was paroled in '96.

352
00:38:01.126 --> 00:38:02.779
And?

353
00:38:02.823 --> 00:38:05.343
And I suppose you think he's
come to thank you for the vacation?


354
00:38:05.368 --> 00:38:06.348
Something like that.

355
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:09.264
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't count on it.


356
00:38:10.222 --> 00:38:13.268
Have you got a strong stomach?

357
00:38:15.488 --> 00:38:19.144
Now you tell me, Alex...

358
00:38:19.405 --> 00:38:21.233
Does that look like
someone who's about


359
00:38:21.276 --> 00:38:23.278
to come knocking on your door?

360
00:38:23.322 --> 00:38:26.499
Sometimes bad memories have
a way of following you around.


361
00:38:26.542 --> 00:38:28.805
You know what I'm saying?

362
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:31.199
I am not crazy.

363
00:38:31.243 --> 00:38:32.331
I'm sorry, Alex.

364
00:38:32.374 --> 00:38:35.290
I don't know what
I can do to help you.


365
00:38:44.386 --> 00:38:46.171
You need to wait
until it dries, Sid.


366
00:38:46.214 --> 00:38:47.694
I'll be an old man by then.

367
00:38:47.737 --> 00:38:51.567
Come on,
we're just gonna have to do it again.


368
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:55.310
Nope, I've almost got it...

369
00:39:03.449 --> 00:39:05.059
Damn it!

370
00:39:05.103 --> 00:39:06.147
I'm sorry, Alex.

371
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:07.540
"I'm sorry, Alex"?

372
00:39:07.583 --> 00:39:10.586
How about listening
to me for once?


373
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.686
Feels good, doesn't it?

374
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:10.472
I have to get
Sandy to the doctor.


375
00:40:10.516 --> 00:40:12.082
You two gonna be...

376
00:40:12.126 --> 00:40:13.214
Oh, honey, that's great!

377
00:40:13.258 --> 00:40:17.566
Is Louis turning you
into a clown?


378
00:40:18.567 --> 00:40:20.917
Will you be staying for dinner?

379
00:40:20.961 --> 00:40:22.005
Probably not.

380
00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:23.050
Mommy...

381
00:40:23.093 --> 00:40:23.964
It's OK, sweetheart.

382
00:40:24.007 --> 00:40:26.096
I'll be back in a little while.

383
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.100
You remember your bedtime, OK?

384
00:40:51.426 --> 00:40:52.906
Alex?

385
00:40:52.949 --> 00:40:55.735
Can I come in?

386
00:41:11.098 --> 00:41:14.710
It's quite a look for you.

387
00:41:20.542 --> 00:41:22.892
Bad day?

388
00:41:24.503 --> 00:41:25.721
I've had better.

389
00:41:25.765 --> 00:41:27.375
Apparently.

390
00:41:27.419 --> 00:41:29.551
I've been seeing things.

391
00:41:29.595 --> 00:41:30.552
Have you?

392
00:41:30.596 --> 00:41:32.554
Things that can't be real.

393
00:41:32.598 --> 00:41:34.556
What?

394
00:41:34.991 --> 00:41:37.951
I thought I saw Louis.

395
00:41:37.994 --> 00:41:39.648
Really?

396
00:41:39.692 --> 00:41:43.478
Was he riding the
Loch Ness monster?


397
00:41:43.522 --> 00:41:45.437
Sandra, it's not funny.

398
00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.526
No, it's not funny.

399
00:41:47.569 --> 00:41:50.572
It's not funny at all.

400
00:41:52.052 --> 00:41:55.011
Al, this place
isn't right for us.


401
00:41:55.055 --> 00:41:56.404
I can handle it.

402
00:41:56.448 --> 00:41:59.320
Can you?
And how come you look like this?


403
00:41:59.364 --> 00:42:01.322
And how come every
time I turn around


404
00:42:01.366 --> 00:42:02.802
something else is broken?

405
00:42:02.845 --> 00:42:03.977
I'm getting it together.

406
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.580
Why is it that every
time someone offers


407
00:42:05.605 --> 00:42:06.588
to buy this shithole,

408
00:42:06.632 --> 00:42:08.286
it's not good enough for you?

409
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:09.591
Not good enough for us.

410
00:42:09.635 --> 00:42:10.505
Fuck that!

411
00:42:10.549 --> 00:42:11.941
Why don't you just admit to me

412
00:42:11.985 --> 00:42:14.379
that you don't really want
to sell this place at all?


413
00:42:14.422 --> 00:42:17.164
Because I don't.

414
00:42:18.034 --> 00:42:21.386
This is mom's place.

415
00:42:26.478 --> 00:42:30.220
I know it's not much.

416
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:34.573
But it's all that
we have left of her.


417
00:42:36.575 --> 00:42:39.491
If we let it go...

418
00:42:41.623 --> 00:42:45.366
Our memories of her
will go with it.


419
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.985
I have a present for you.

420
00:42:59.902 --> 00:43:03.776
I was saving this
for your birthday.


421
00:43:09.695 --> 00:43:14.482
Remember how scared you
were to ride the Ferris wheel?


422
00:43:14.526 --> 00:43:15.527
Yeah.

423
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.964
Till mom told me
it was like jumping,


424
00:43:18.007 --> 00:43:21.881
except you never really fall.

425
00:43:25.406 --> 00:43:28.583
It's all right there.

426
00:43:29.889 --> 00:43:33.501
It's all right here.

427
00:43:33.806 --> 00:43:37.592
And no one can take that
away from you.


428
00:43:41.117 --> 00:43:44.425
I'm not ready to go.

429
00:43:45.165 --> 00:43:47.863
I know.

430
00:43:48.429 --> 00:43:52.172
But you're closer
than you think.


431
00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.004
And until then...

432
00:43:59.353 --> 00:44:03.052
I guess we'll just have
to stick around here...


433
00:44:03.096 --> 00:44:07.883
Till you feel like you can
take those memories with you.


434
00:44:12.627 --> 00:44:17.893
In the meantime,
why don't you take it easy tonight?


435
00:44:17.937 --> 00:44:18.938
But the bar...

436
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:21.506
I'll worry about the bar.

437
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:24.944
I owe you one, anyways.

438
00:44:30.123 --> 00:44:32.473
Thanks.

439
00:47:52.412 --> 00:47:55.110
Hey, get out of here!

440
00:47:55.154 --> 00:47:58.070
You're not ready yet!

441
00:48:12.214 --> 00:48:13.999
Let me out of here!

442
00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:53.647
Hi, Dr. Goldfine, please?

443
00:48:53.691 --> 00:48:58.565
Yes, this is Alex Grant.
I'm a patient of his.


444
00:48:58.608 --> 00:49:01.786
Yes, I need to see him again.

445
00:49:02.047 --> 00:49:05.703
No, no, I... I don't...

446
00:49:06.181 --> 00:49:09.054
I can't wait that long.

447
00:49:10.098 --> 00:49:13.798
Fine.
Yeah, I understand.


448
00:49:18.019 --> 00:49:20.761
Yeah. I
-I'll do that.

449
00:49:28.247 --> 00:49:31.598
How can then voice of dread,

450
00:49:31.641 --> 00:49:33.208
With bitter tidings laden,

451
00:49:33.252 --> 00:49:35.558
shall summon to unwelcome bed

452
00:49:35.602 --> 00:49:38.213
a melancholy maiden?

453
00:49:38.257 --> 00:49:40.172
But not yet!

454
00:49:40.215 --> 00:49:42.261
Wanna do my makeup?

455
00:49:42.304 --> 00:49:45.960
But your face is already done.

456
00:49:46.656 --> 00:49:50.878
We're not gonna do my face.

457
00:50:17.296 --> 00:50:18.514
Thanks.

458
00:50:18.558 --> 00:50:19.820
Yeah.

459
00:50:19.864 --> 00:50:22.344
Listen,
I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.


460
00:50:22.388 --> 00:50:26.087
I
-I'm just kind of...

461
00:50:26.653 --> 00:50:29.656
Hey. It's all right.

462
00:50:29.699 --> 00:50:33.268
I know you've been having
a hard time.


463
00:50:33.965 --> 00:50:36.271
It's gonna be OK, though.

464
00:50:36.315 --> 00:50:39.448
I hope you know that.

465
00:50:40.275 --> 00:50:42.190
Thanks.

466
00:50:42.234 --> 00:50:45.890
Look, let me get you
some more longnecks.


467
00:50:54.594 --> 00:50:57.510
Alex?

468
00:51:03.777 --> 00:51:06.475
You doing OK?

469
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:09.043
Me?

470
00:51:09.087 --> 00:51:09.957
I feel great.

471
00:51:10.001 --> 00:51:11.872
You're a great bartender, Alex,

472
00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:15.354
but you're a terrible liar.

473
00:51:15.397 --> 00:51:17.312
A penny for your thoughts.

474
00:51:17.356 --> 00:51:20.141
Henry...

475
00:51:20.446 --> 00:51:21.726
Do you ever think a person knows

476
00:51:21.751 --> 00:51:23.536
that they're going crazy?

477
00:51:23.579 --> 00:51:25.451
I don't know.

478
00:51:25.494 --> 00:51:26.974
I think there's far more people

479
00:51:27.018 --> 00:51:31.239
who think they know when
someone else is goin' crazy.


480
00:51:31.283 --> 00:51:33.372
Hey, Alex...

481
00:51:36.027 --> 00:51:36.941
Yes?

482
00:51:36.984 --> 00:51:39.552
Two beers.

483
00:51:58.223 --> 00:52:02.053
Alex, behind you.

484
00:52:02.314 --> 00:52:05.665
All right... you tip on the tabs.

485
00:52:12.541 --> 00:52:15.544
These guys wanna hear me sing.

486
00:52:15.588 --> 00:52:16.676
Do they?

487
00:52:16.719 --> 00:52:21.159
Yeah. But I told them we're busy,
so...


488
00:52:22.334 --> 00:52:25.076
So, you've got a good audience.

489
00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:28.253
Go ahead. I'll take care
of things back here.


490
00:52:28.296 --> 00:52:29.558
Yeah?

491
00:52:29.602 --> 00:52:31.604
Yeah.

492
00:52:45.009 --> 00:52:53.009
♪ Mama always warned me

493
00:52:54.757 --> 00:53:02.417

she's very good.

499
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.366
Yeah, she is.

500
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.369
You two are pretty close?

501
00:53:41.413 --> 00:53:45.460
I don't think there's
anything I wouldn't do for her.


502
00:53:47.462 --> 00:53:51.466
♪ Sinners I have known

503
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:56.950
♪ and their signs I understand

504
00:53:56.994 --> 00:54:01.520
♪ but a man whose eyes show

505
00:54:01.563 --> 00:54:05.393
♪ no lies

506
00:54:05.437 --> 00:54:09.267
♪ and no blame

507
00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:13.271
♪ no disguise

508
00:54:13.314 --> 00:54:15.708
♪ and no shame

509
00:54:15.751 --> 00:54:17.318
can I get you something?

510
00:54:17.362 --> 00:54:18.972
No thanks.

511
00:54:19.016 --> 00:54:20.582
I don't like to drink.

512
00:54:20.626 --> 00:54:25.326
A bar's a funny place for
someone who doesn't like to drink.


513
00:54:29.504 --> 00:54:31.680
What do you like?

514
00:54:34.466 --> 00:54:36.685
You know, I could be wrong,

515
00:54:36.729 --> 00:54:40.298
but I get a feeling you
might be flirting with me.


516
00:54:41.212 --> 00:54:43.779
I'm just making conversation.

517
00:54:43.823 --> 00:54:45.781
It's part of the job, you know.

518
00:54:45.825 --> 00:54:48.349
Yeah, I know.

519
00:54:48.393 --> 00:54:51.874
And she who flirts with
all is less likely to fall


520
00:54:51.918 --> 00:54:56.662
than she who flirts
with just one. Right?


521
00:54:58.142 --> 00:55:00.753
Alex?

522
00:55:04.583 --> 00:55:07.107
Let me buy you a drink.

523
00:55:07.151 --> 00:55:09.240
Take the edge off.

524
00:55:14.114 --> 00:55:17.291
Buy me one later.

525
00:55:18.423 --> 00:55:20.816
You're not afraid, are you?

526
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:23.950
I'm not afraid.

527
00:55:25.299 --> 00:55:28.302
But you will be.

528
00:55:28.346 --> 00:55:31.566
You will be.

529
00:55:39.705 --> 00:55:41.359
Great.

530
00:55:41.402 --> 00:55:43.056
What's up with you?

531
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.146
Nothing.
I'm fine.


532
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:49.323
You been sneaking
martinis behind the bar?


533
00:55:49.367 --> 00:55:52.152
No, I'm fine.

534
00:55:53.066 --> 00:55:54.937
Ok.

535
00:56:08.212 --> 00:56:11.040
Did you tell him I was here?

536
00:56:13.086 --> 00:56:15.654
Well?

537
00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:18.874
What did he say?

538
00:56:18.918 --> 00:56:23.749
He said he would be
with you shortly.


539
00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:43.986
Alex Grant.

540
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.944
Yes?

541
00:56:44.987 --> 00:56:48.948
The doctor is ready for you now.

542
00:56:53.474 --> 00:56:56.608
It's down the hall
and to the right.


543
00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:58.740
Yes, I know where it is.

544
00:57:14.713 --> 00:57:18.412
Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.


545
00:57:18.456 --> 00:57:21.807
I felt that it
just couldn't wait.


546
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:23.504
What's going on?

547
00:57:24.201 --> 00:57:29.336
Well, I've been having the... You know,
the stress thing.


548
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.512
Like right after the accident.

549
00:57:31.556 --> 00:57:33.210
Car accident?

550
00:57:33.253 --> 00:57:35.124
Yes.

551
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:41.392
I've been telling myself
that everything's... Fine


552
00:57:41.435 --> 00:57:43.394
and that I'm OK.

553
00:57:45.396 --> 00:57:48.312
Everything's not fine,

554
00:57:48.355 --> 00:57:50.096
and I'm not OK.

555
00:57:50.139 --> 00:57:51.837
What seems to be the problem?

556
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.883
I've been seeing things.

557
00:57:54.927 --> 00:57:57.408
What is it that
you've been seeing?


558
00:57:57.451 --> 00:57:59.410
Louis.

559
00:58:00.715 --> 00:58:02.630
I've been seeing Louis.

560
00:58:02.674 --> 00:58:03.805
And...

561
00:58:03.849 --> 00:58:06.591
Have you tried talking
to him about that?


562
00:58:07.592 --> 00:58:08.854
He's dead.

563
00:58:08.897 --> 00:58:10.508
I see.

564
00:58:10.551 --> 00:58:14.338
Don't you remember?
You counseled me right after the accident.


565
00:58:14.381 --> 00:58:16.427
You said...

566
00:58:17.993 --> 00:58:22.128
Look, I think I need
some help here.


567
00:58:22.781 --> 00:58:27.612
Alex, I will try
my best to help you.


568
00:58:30.876 --> 00:58:32.791
Can I smoke in here?

569
00:58:32.834 --> 00:58:34.836
Of course.

570
00:58:37.622 --> 00:58:41.930
How long ago did this
accident take place?


571
00:58:42.975 --> 00:58:44.455
5 months ago.

572
00:58:44.498 --> 00:58:48.285
Are you telling me that you
can't remember back 5 months?


573
00:58:48.328 --> 00:58:49.851
Yes, we keep excellent records,

574
00:58:49.895 --> 00:58:54.552
and I like to think I keep
very good track of my patients.


575
00:58:55.814 --> 00:58:57.511
Good, you can pull my file,

576
00:58:57.555 --> 00:59:01.472
and you can see that I'm
not some kind of wacko.


577
00:59:01.515 --> 00:59:03.212
There is no file on you.

578
00:59:03.256 --> 00:59:05.040
What do you mean
there's no file?


579
00:59:05.084 --> 00:59:08.566
I've never met you before today.

580
00:59:12.265 --> 00:59:14.093
Who are you?

581
00:59:14.136 --> 00:59:15.224
Alex, please.

582
00:59:15.268 --> 00:59:18.097
Look, I would like to...

583
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.621
Suggest...

584
00:59:22.406 --> 00:59:25.147
Alex?

585
00:59:43.862 --> 00:59:47.605
I take it that one's
not worth remembering.


586
00:59:51.652 --> 00:59:53.611
Now you're trespassing.

587
00:59:53.654 --> 00:59:55.047
I know.

588
00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:57.397
I was wondering if you're
ready for that boat ride.


589
00:59:57.441 --> 00:59:59.443
I can't leave Sandra alone.

590
00:59:59.486 --> 01:00:04.622
I have a feeling she
can take care of herself.


591
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.015
I like your necklace.

592
01:00:07.059 --> 01:00:09.757
Thanks.
It belonged to my mother.


593
01:00:09.801 --> 01:00:12.151
Before she died.

594
01:00:15.023 --> 01:00:16.460
It reminds me of her.

595
01:00:16.503 --> 01:00:19.550
Memento Mori.

596
01:00:19.593 --> 01:00:21.203
May I?

597
01:00:21.247 --> 01:00:23.641
Yeah.

598
01:00:23.684 --> 01:00:25.643
She died too soon.

599
01:00:25.686 --> 01:00:28.776
How do you know that?

600
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.517
Because I saw it.

601
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:33.694
But you can't know that.

602
01:00:33.738 --> 01:00:36.305
Only she can know if
she was ready to die.


603
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:39.047
Trust me, she wasn't ready.

604
01:00:39.091 --> 01:00:43.443
That may be true,
but it's a very personal thing.


605
01:00:43.487 --> 01:00:48.361
One dies when she wants,
as she wants,


606
01:00:48.405 --> 01:00:49.754
of what she chooses.

607
01:00:49.797 --> 01:00:54.411
My mother chose a man
she thought she could trust.


608
01:00:56.891 --> 01:01:01.069
Memento Mori doesn't mean
to remember the dead, anyway.


609
01:01:01.983 --> 01:01:04.595
What is it, then?

610
01:01:04.638 --> 01:01:10.078
To remember that
we all must die.


611
01:01:12.516 --> 01:01:15.736
I have to get to work.

612
01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.356
I know it sounds impossible,

613
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.273
but I know he's here.

614
01:01:31.317 --> 01:01:35.452
Come on, Al,
Louis is dead, remember?


615
01:01:37.628 --> 01:01:39.543
Ok...

616
01:01:39.586 --> 01:01:40.979
Let me put it this way.

617
01:01:41.022 --> 01:01:45.287
If Louis were still
creeping around the house,


618
01:01:45.331 --> 01:01:47.246
which he is not,

619
01:01:47.289 --> 01:01:51.293
but if he were,
and he wanted to get you,


620
01:01:51.337 --> 01:01:54.471
why wouldn't he have
gotten you sooner?


621
01:01:54.514 --> 01:01:57.604
Because that
wouldn't be any fun.


622
01:01:59.214 --> 01:02:02.566
OK, whatever.

623
01:02:02.609 --> 01:02:03.567
I'm out of here.

624
01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:06.395
I'm ready to get
out of here, too.


625
01:02:06.439 --> 01:02:08.615
Excuse me?

626
01:02:08.963 --> 01:02:14.882
I said I want to leave
and not come back.


627
01:02:18.582 --> 01:02:20.018
That's great.
That's great.


628
01:02:20.061 --> 01:02:24.544
I think there's
hope for you yet.


629
01:02:24.588 --> 01:02:26.633
I got to go.

630
01:02:27.808 --> 01:02:29.549
Wait...

631
01:02:29.593 --> 01:02:31.551
What?

632
01:02:31.595 --> 01:02:33.553
Take this with you.

633
01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:34.685
Thank you very much.

634
01:02:34.728 --> 01:02:36.904
You're going out like that?

635
01:02:36.948 --> 01:02:38.906
Yes, I'm going out like this.

636
01:02:40.473 --> 01:02:41.909
What?

637
01:02:41.953 --> 01:02:45.783
I said I'll be fine.
Try not to worry about me so much.


638
01:02:45.826 --> 01:02:47.611
It's supposed to rain later,
and...


639
01:02:47.654 --> 01:02:48.568
Alex...

640
01:02:48.612 --> 01:02:53.094
I'll be fine.

641
01:04:02.424 --> 01:04:05.384
Hello?

642
01:04:32.846 --> 01:04:35.632
Sandra?

643
01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:50.385
Sandra!

644
01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.377
Sorry, miss, we're not open yet.

645
01:06:09.421 --> 01:06:13.425
Oh, Alex, hi!
I didn't see it was you.


646
01:06:13.468 --> 01:06:16.167
Come on, don't
look so surprised.


647
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:20.475
I told you I never hold a
grudge once I get even.


648
01:06:20.519 --> 01:06:21.563
You know...

649
01:06:21.607 --> 01:06:24.566
I think I've figured out
your problem.


650
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.744
Well, one of your problems.

651
01:06:28.745 --> 01:06:31.443
You don't know how
to have any fun.


652
01:06:31.486 --> 01:06:34.663
See, aren't you glad we met?

653
01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:37.449
I curse the day
you ever found me.


654
01:06:38.537 --> 01:06:42.149
Am I bleeding?
I think I've been cut.


655
01:06:42.193 --> 01:06:45.500
You've still got it wrong, Alex.

656
01:06:45.544 --> 01:06:48.634
I didn't find you.

657
01:06:49.853 --> 01:06:52.377
You found me.

658
01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.249
You can find me again, Alex.

659
01:06:55.293 --> 01:06:59.079
You've always known
where to find me.


660
01:06:59.123 --> 01:07:00.689
No!

661
01:08:25.296 --> 01:08:27.602
I'll take you.

662
01:08:51.409 --> 01:08:53.933
I feel like I'm going to hell.

663
01:08:53.977 --> 01:08:59.765
Sometimes you have to face your
demons in order to see the angels, Alex.


664
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:14.823
It's time to let go.

665
01:09:14.867 --> 01:09:16.869
I can't.

666
01:09:18.915 --> 01:09:20.960
I haven't lived yet.

667
01:09:21.004 --> 01:09:24.137
Then why are you here?

668
01:10:55.402 --> 01:10:57.578
Michael.

669
01:12:53.172 --> 01:12:56.654
I'm late. I'm late
for a very important date.


670
01:12:57.524 --> 01:12:59.526
Watch where you're going.

671
01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:17.109
I told you to watch
where you're going.


672
01:13:43.135 --> 01:13:45.137
Gotcha!

673
01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:26.646
Help me, Alex!

674
01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:30.041
Please don't leave me here.

675
01:16:30.084 --> 01:16:33.000
Don't leave me alone with him.

676
01:16:33.044 --> 01:16:34.132
Please!

677
01:16:34.175 --> 01:16:37.353
It's you he wants!

678
01:17:07.383 --> 01:17:10.951
Nice of you to join us, Alex.

679
01:17:32.582 --> 01:17:33.974
Remember this?

680
01:17:34.018 --> 01:17:37.151
This is my favorite part.

681
01:17:38.504 --> 01:17:40.464
Shame you caught me
and your mother doing it, too.


682
01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.895
Might not have had to kill her.

683
01:17:41.939 --> 01:17:43.288
You would have anyway.

684
01:17:43.331 --> 01:17:45.943
She knew you could only
get it up with little girls.


685
01:17:45.986 --> 01:17:48.206
You know, guilt is
a funny thing, Alex.


686
01:17:48.249 --> 01:17:50.469
It haunts you
as real as any ghost.


687
01:17:51.731 --> 01:17:52.794
I think you're just
too scared to admit it.


688
01:17:52.819 --> 01:17:54.342
Which is fine
with us, by the way,


689
01:17:54.386 --> 01:17:55.953
because the longer you hang on,

690
01:17:55.996 --> 01:17:59.435
the longer we get to play.

691
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.266
I'm just hanging on long enough
to blow your fucking head off.


692
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:07.617
Don't be hasty.

693
01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:10.271
You wouldn't hurt
a clown, would you?


694
01:18:13.492 --> 01:18:15.799
Will I?
Won't I?


695
01:18:15.842 --> 01:18:16.930
You don't have the guts.

696
01:18:16.974 --> 01:18:20.499
Will I?
Won't I?


697
01:18:20.543 --> 01:18:24.808
Won't I join the dance?

698
01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.396
Come on, Sandra!

699
01:20:02.122 --> 01:20:07.954
Sometimes bad memories have
a way of following you around.


700
01:20:12.611 --> 01:20:18.138
I said I'll be fine.
Quit worrying about me so much.


701
01:20:24.667 --> 01:20:27.495
You're not afraid, are you?

702
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:35.025
Sid, voice-over: I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME.


703
01:20:35.068 --> 01:20:37.767
It's going to be OK, though.

704
01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:39.986
I hope you know that.

705
01:21:52.015 --> 01:21:53.843
Al?

706
01:21:56.019 --> 01:21:57.934
Alex?

707
01:22:01.067 --> 01:22:03.156
That looks like your car.

708
01:22:07.073 --> 01:22:08.771
Ain't this where they
had that carnival?


709
01:22:08.814 --> 01:22:14.254
Carnival? Hasn't been a
carnival out here in 20 years.


710
01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:51.161
Did you notice any strange behavior?
Mood swings?


711
01:22:51.204 --> 01:22:54.599
When was the last
time you saw her?


712
01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:58.516
Excuse me.

713
01:23:48.827 --> 01:23:50.916
Hello.

714
01:23:55.703 --> 01:23:57.314
Hello?
