Last one there
goes to prison!


2
00:01:24.374 --> 00:01:25.710
Wait, that's not fair.
Wait for me!


3
00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:27.444
I said if you want to
see a clattering engine,


4
00:01:27.477 --> 00:01:29.647
stop by the Commons
on the first Friday
of the month.


5
00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:33.216
What do you
think is?


6
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.852
Might just be a drill.

7
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.688
Very strange,
don't you think?
Haven't you heard?


8
00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:37.989
Heard what?

9
00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:38.990
A rupture of some sort
in the engine.


10
00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:40.190
Oh, here comes someone.

11
00:01:40.223 --> 00:01:41.859
Excuse me,
where do you think he's going?


12
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:42.894
Hello?

13
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.774
Take one, keep moving please.

14
00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.576
Take one.

15
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.044
- Did you say this way?
- Everything will be fine.


16
00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.311
Upstairs and turn left.

17
00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:02.947
I don't like this madness.

18
00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:05.750
Are we sinking?
No.
Upstairs, turn left.


19
00:02:05.783 --> 00:02:06.784
Everything will be fine.

20
00:02:06.818 --> 00:02:08.251
Just continue upstairs,
please.


21
00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:09.687
Keep moving, please.

22
00:02:10.054 --> 00:02:11.421
Sir, keep moving, please.

23
00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:12.790
There you go, Sir.

24
00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:14.692
Are there at least enough
lifeboats this time?


25
00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:16.628
Keep calm, go upstairs please.

26
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.508
Hello?

27
00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:35.647
Mrs Ratch?

28
00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:51.029
The porter found her
twenty minutes ago.


29
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:52.429
And?

30
00:02:52.497 --> 00:02:54.297
Apparently, her husband
used an axe.


31
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:55.833
Oh my God.

32
00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:59.169
The lunatic
hasn't stopped
whistling since he got here.


33
00:02:59.937 --> 00:03:01.271
The little girl?

34
00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:02.740
We're still looking.

Why aren't
you upstairs?

00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:26.624
I was. But an incident occurred

they cancelled?

Stop worrying. Apparently
Mrs Howe's weak stomach


63
00:06:30.281 --> 00:06:31.414
caused her so much upset,

64

That's a terrible name.

I was fine in
third class dining.


70
00:06:42.226 --> 00:06:43.227
I wasn't.

71
00:06:43.628 --> 00:06:45.129
-Were you?
-Mm-hmm.


72
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.365
Oh, what does
a seven-year-old know?

-Eight!
-Really?


74
00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:50.334
Have you any idea
what will happen


75
00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.737
if they catch us
impersonating other guests?

Thank you.

77
00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:01.512
We, err, reserved
a table.
The name is Howe.


78
00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:03.080
William Howe?

79
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.216
Ah, yes. Er, you cancelled.

80
00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:06.684
Well, we're here now.

81
00:07:06.717 --> 00:07:08.619
That table is no longer
available.


82
00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:10.922
I'm sorry, Mr Howe.

83
00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:13.858
And it was for two guests, only.

84
00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:16.027
Captain...Howe.

85
00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:18.029
Army, Sir?

86
00:07:18.763 --> 00:07:21.365
Infantry. Northern Ireland.

87
00:07:23.868 --> 00:07:25.202
Did you serve?

88
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.339
Royal engineers. Palestine.

89
00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:32.475
Oh, bugger.

90
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.578
Blasted lighter.

91
00:07:34.612 --> 00:07:36.814
Could have sworn I brought it
with me.


92
00:07:45.957 --> 00:07:49.026
Well...Captain Howe.

93
00:07:49.493 --> 00:07:51.461
Shall we see about that table?

94
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.101
Happy Halloween!

95
00:07:57.134 --> 00:07:59.737
And boy, oh, boy, have
we got a show
or you tonight!


96
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.639
So, come and join us
on the dance floor


97
00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:03.908
and let's 'raise some spirits'!

98
00:08:16.253 --> 00:08:17.487
This is you, Sir.

99
00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:21.959
Ah, perhaps you have something
a little more...


100
00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:24.395
central, for an old army pal?

101
00:08:24.428 --> 00:08:26.230
My usual table.

102
00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.741
Reserved, I'm afraid.

103
00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:39.443
Typical army engineer.

104
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:42.813
Technically correct,
but of no use to anyone.


105
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.448
Enjoy your evening, Sir.

106
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.683
Oh, fuck off.

107
00:08:45.716 --> 00:08:47.752

110
00:08:51.122 --> 00:08:53.691
Made the one about a couple who
have a child out of wedlock,


111
00:08:53.724 --> 00:08:55.494
with hilarious consequences.

112
00:08:55.526 --> 00:08:58.462
One Up, One Down?
- Yeah, yeah.
Quite liked it.


113
00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:01.198
Heard he was in London
making a picture
with Fred Astaire.


114
00:09:01.232 --> 00:09:02.233
Really?

115
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.368
I should go over
and introduce myself.


116
00:09:04.402 --> 00:09:05.336
-No.
-No.


117
00:09:05.369 --> 00:09:06.537
You always say,

118
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.639
"If an opportunity comes along,
grab it."


119
00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:10.509
Yeah, I do, but never beg.

120
00:09:10.541 --> 00:09:12.710
Opportunity is slippery.

121
00:09:12.743 --> 00:09:15.713
It's like trying to catch a fish
with bare hands.


122
00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:18.649
The trick is to wait
and let it come to you,


123
00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:20.317
then when it gets close...

124
00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:21.819
...grab it!

125
00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:23.154
And don't let it go,

126
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.856
no matter how much it begs
and tries to slip away.


127
00:09:26.223 --> 00:09:27.691
Hold on tight.

128
00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:31.162
And don't be afraid
to get your hands dirty.


129
00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:32.630
How long must I wait?

Er, I'm not sure that's
the angle they want to take.

Well, then change his mind.

Who wants to read about
boring old architecture

Yep.
Feels that way.


157
00:10:39.697 --> 00:10:41.398
He might as well
live in a different country.


158
00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.033
Well, it's kind of appropriate,
then,


159
00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:46.070
that we are meeting on a ship
that has travelled
the whole world.

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:49.574
-Or a different continent.
-Honey, you're being
a little dramatic.


161
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.041
You just needed time
to settle in.


162

-What?

00:10:57.381 --> 00:10:58.716
-Nothing.
-I told you,


165
00:10:58.749 --> 00:10:59.917
those kids don't know
what they're talking about.


166
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.318
That is why they're kids.

167
00:11:02.486 --> 00:11:03.787
Do you believe them?

168
00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:06.558
Then you are just as stupid
as they are.


169
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.827
-No, I'm not!
No, you're not. You're not.


170
00:11:13.565 --> 00:11:17.569
A sailor went to...

171
00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:19.403
♪sea, sea, sea...♪

172

♪...see, see, see♪

174
00:11:24.643 --> 00:11:26.143
I'm not four.

175
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.311
Right.

176
00:11:28.012 --> 00:11:30.481

182
00:12:03.648 --> 00:12:04.815
Okay.

183
00:12:05.282 --> 00:12:07.818
Go do some of that
ghost hunting, honey.


184
00:12:47.191 --> 00:12:48.560
For thirty-one years,

185
00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:51.730
the Queen Mary served
as a majestic city of the sea.


186
00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:54.832
Now she's dropped anchor
for the final time.


187
00:12:54.865 --> 00:12:56.200
Closing out a career

188
00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:59.403
unequalled in the history of
commercial sea voyaging.


189
00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:01.640
A career that took her
through a depression,


190
00:13:01.673 --> 00:13:05.242
a world war,
a period of unequalled glory,


191
00:13:05.276 --> 00:13:06.711
and a last great voyage.

192
00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.313
Well, I would describe
this Queen Mary's
the most elegant


193
00:13:09.346 --> 00:13:12.617
and the finest ship that has
ever sailed any of the oceans.


194
00:13:12.651 --> 00:13:14.918
The saddest
thing is,
I think, to ever happen


195
00:13:14.952 --> 00:13:18.690
because this has got to
be one of the most
beautiful ships that was, er...


196
00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:20.190
anyone's ever built.

197
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.261
We feel that The Queen Mary
will be sort of


198
00:13:24.295 --> 00:13:27.264
the crown jewel in what
we hope will be


199
00:13:27.298 --> 00:13:31.902
the foremost water recreation
development in the entire
United States.


200
00:13:31.935 --> 00:13:35.072
Their predictions
are as high as
two and a half million
people a year


201
00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:40.344
will be coming down
to visit and board
The Queen Mary for its
various activities.


202
00:13:42.547 --> 00:13:46.950
The quality of the work
and the story that you
tell, the pictures,


203
00:13:46.984 --> 00:13:50.287
that's all very...quality,
the quality...


204
00:13:50.821 --> 00:13:53.223
-Dad! Dad!
-Hey, son!


205
00:13:53.857 --> 00:13:55.259
I have missed you.

206
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:56.427
Me too!

207
00:13:56.927 --> 00:14:00.264
-Hi, Patrick.
-Hey...Anne.


208
00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:01.733
Glad you made it,

209
00:14:01.865 --> 00:14:03.267
although you are a little late,
but that's fine.


210
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.169
-Sorry.
-I rung ahead, let them know.


211
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:07.071
You wanna go through it again,
or...?


212
00:14:07.438 --> 00:14:08.506
-The pitch?
-Yeah.


213
00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:10.407
Um, I'm good if you are?

214
00:14:10.441 --> 00:14:13.243
I'm, I'm good.
-Er, well, although, er...


215
00:14:13.444 --> 00:14:17.281
the publisher thinks a more
holistic approach is needed.


216
00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:22.920
Um, books, website, 3D tour?

217
00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:24.888
Guests have reported

218
00:14:24.922 --> 00:14:26.490
seeing a woman in white,
playing piano.


219
00:14:26.524 --> 00:14:29.059
A war bride, who,
after learning her husband died


220
00:14:29.093 --> 00:14:31.663
serving in France,
took her own life.


221
00:14:32.229 --> 00:14:35.199
You can pick up a
limited-edition
doll
of the woman in white


222
00:14:35.232 --> 00:14:37.134
in the gift shop
on your way out.


223
00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:40.938
Next, we'll see where
Fred Astaire
once danced the cha cha.


224
00:14:40.971 --> 00:14:44.341
I'm half expecting Fred Astaire
to jump out and try
sell me a hoover.


225
00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:46.845
-So, what's this
about a 3D tour?
-Oh, sorry.


226
00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:49.079
Er, you know, I just thought
you could mention it to him.


227
00:14:49.113 --> 00:14:50.815
It, it's a
big thing to just
mention.


228
00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.116
There are no visuals,
no concept work.


229
00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:53.618
Besides we've been
through this...
-Hey, uh...


230
00:14:53.651 --> 00:14:55.285
-...the ship's almost

231
00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:56.855
It deserves
something...
- I'm thirsty.


232
00:14:56.887 --> 00:14:58.255
...you can feel and touch.
Something that lasts.


233
00:14:58.288 --> 00:14:59.490
- Can I get a frappe?
- Er, sure.


234
00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:00.792
No, honey.
Who lets a kid drink coffee?


235
00:15:00.825 --> 00:15:02.192
- Oh, come on!
- Fine.


236
00:15:02.226 --> 00:15:03.528
Hang on,
I'll give you water.


237
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:04.562
Oh, forget it.

238
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:05.830
With or without all this.

239
00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:07.431
But, er, you don't agree?

240
00:15:07.464 --> 00:15:09.768
No, I do, I do.
I think you're incredibly noble.


241
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:11.268
-Well, thank you.
-And righteous.


242
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.970
-Yeah, keep going.
-And have amazing intentions.


243
00:15:13.003 --> 00:15:15.072
I feel like the idea
is a little dated.


244
00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:16.473
I don't know what a book
is gonna do


245
00:15:16.508 --> 00:15:17.675
to save The Queen Mary.

246
00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.677
Get your God damn
freaking hands off me!


247
00:15:23.147 --> 00:15:25.115
If I catch you sneaking
in here one more time,


248
00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:27.284
I swear to God,
I'll crack your head open.


249
00:15:27.317 --> 00:15:29.019
So, I've been published
three times.


250
00:15:29.052 --> 00:15:30.954
Oh, we're counting
academic papers now?


251
00:15:30.988 --> 00:15:32.624
All warmly received.

252
00:15:37.862 --> 00:15:39.631
Welcome to L.A.

253
00:15:39.664 --> 00:15:40.931
These days.

254
00:15:41.064 --> 00:15:42.667
So, what do you think?

255
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.903
Look, isn't
the real reason
you wanted to work on this...


256
00:15:44.935 --> 00:15:46.638
so you can spend time with...

257
00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:50.240
Hey, buddy.

258
00:15:50.274 --> 00:15:51.709
Huh? Yeah?

259
00:15:52.342 --> 00:15:55.279
Er...you wanna go on the
haunted tour


260
00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.381
while your mom has her
boring meeting?


261
00:15:58.583 --> 00:15:59.617
Yeah!

262
00:16:00.984 --> 00:16:02.654
-Good luck.
-Thank you.


263
00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:04.722
Yeah.

264
00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.990
-Come on.
-Bye, Mom!


265
00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:11.596
I'll be fine.

- Captain.
- Oh, Gibson.


283
00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:26.771
I've looked at your proposal.

284
00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:28.606
-Oh, right.
-Let's be clear,


285
00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.174
we're on the world's
fastest ocean liner.


286
00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:35.345
And all you're thinking about
is how to make us go faster.


287
00:17:36.113 --> 00:17:37.414
I like it.
-Yes, Sir, about that...


288
00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:38.983
-Passengers travel
on The Queen Mary


289
00:17:39.316 --> 00:17:41.920
because of two words,
Blue Riband.


290
00:17:42.386 --> 00:17:45.389
Not just an award for fastest
transatlantic crossing,


291
00:17:45.422 --> 00:17:46.724
but a guarantee.

292
00:17:46.991 --> 00:17:48.526
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Captain.


293
00:17:48.593 --> 00:17:51.428
So, if our rivals
want the title of
world's fastest,


294
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:55.165
well, fuel consumption
is the new battle ground.


295
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.768
Not propulsion.

296
00:17:57.234 --> 00:18:00.605
Slow? Gibson, why haven't you
rung off full ahead?


297
00:18:00.738 --> 00:18:03.541
Yes, Sir, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.


298
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:05.843
Standing
still would mean


299
00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:09.013
almost certain death
for a project of this magnitude.


300
00:18:09.581 --> 00:18:13.818
So, when the Great
Depression halted
construction for over a year,


301
00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:15.019
a deal was struck

302
00:18:15.085 --> 00:18:18.121
for Cunard to merge
with White Star Line.


303
00:18:18.355 --> 00:18:21.091
Owners of the ill-fated Titanic.

304
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:24.629
Creating Cunard White Star.

305
00:18:25.228 --> 00:18:29.000
Steam was generated
in massive furnaces,


306
00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:34.338
superheated and passed to engine
at seven-hundred degrees
Fahrenheit.


307
00:18:34.371 --> 00:18:38.042
About four-hundred
pound per square inch. Phew!


308
00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:40.410
Now, I don't mean
to scare y'all,


309
00:18:40.511 --> 00:18:45.115
but this was the scene of an
accident in 1938,


310
00:18:45.148 --> 00:18:47.785
when steam built up
behind an emergency door,


311
00:18:47.885 --> 00:18:50.320
escaped, killing an engineer...

312
00:18:50.387 --> 00:18:51.956
...shutting down
the main engine.


313
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:56.360
Guests have since reported
hearing his haunting scream...


314
00:18:56.527 --> 00:18:58.096
-Dad!
...throughout the ship.


315
00:18:58.161 --> 00:18:59.597
Hey, Dad!

316
00:19:00.898 --> 00:19:03.166
Dad!

317
00:19:43.407 --> 00:19:44.408
Dad!

318
00:19:45.543 --> 00:19:47.310
She survived
head on collisions,


319
00:19:47.344 --> 00:19:51.381
Hitler's relentless
wolf packs and even
a one-hundred-foot rogue wave,


320
00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:54.351
causing many to believe
her blessed.


321
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.703
Mrs Calder?

322
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.876
Mrs Calder.

323
00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:21.746
-Miss.
-Oh, Miss Calder.


324
00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:24.214
Yes, yes. Hello, hello.

325
00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:25.550
Um, Mr Torres?

326
00:20:25.583 --> 00:20:27.885
Er, no, er, Charles Bittner.

327
00:20:30.755 --> 00:20:31.823
Are you the historian?

328
00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.559
I'm our, er, humble Captain.

329
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.732
I work directly with Mr Torres,
our historian. You were delayed?


330
00:20:41.264 --> 00:20:43.067
He asked if I'd fill in.

331
00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:44.769
Oh, please.

332
00:20:47.805 --> 00:20:48.973
Shit.

333
00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:02.720
Hello?

334
00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:51.969
Pipes started shaking,

335
00:21:52.003 --> 00:21:53.171
so I reduced the speed.

336
00:21:53.204 --> 00:21:55.006
-And?
-Problem's coming from in there.


337
00:21:57.141 --> 00:21:58.209
It's hot to the touch.

338
00:21:58.242 --> 00:21:59.877
I wouldn't venture in there.

339
00:21:59.911 --> 00:22:02.680
My guess is cracked steam pipes
and a cocktail of
superheated oil.


340
00:22:02.713 --> 00:22:05.049
That room is probably

341
00:22:05.082 --> 00:22:06.316
We need to shut her
down, Captain.


342
00:22:06.349 --> 00:22:07.718
Let the engineers do their work.

343
00:22:07.752 --> 00:22:08.886
No.

344
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.353
Reduce speed to 15 knots.

345
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.058
-Captain, it only takes
a spark from...
- All that clatter down here,


346
00:22:14.091 --> 00:22:15.927
you must've lost your hearing.

347
00:22:16.027 --> 00:22:18.395
I said do not stop.

348
00:22:18.563 --> 00:22:21.199
By all means, find
a way to reduce
the pressure and speed.


349
00:22:21.232 --> 00:22:22.233
Gradually.

350
00:22:22.266 --> 00:22:23.968
But do not stop.

351
00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:28.371
And the next time you decide
to slow my ship without
my consent,


352
00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:30.340
I'll leave you at
the nearest port.


353
00:22:30.373 --> 00:22:31.676
Yes, Captain.

354
00:23:12.617 --> 00:23:13.618
H-hello?

355
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:39.810
Are you lost?

356
00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:42.013
How old are you?

357
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.781
Eight.

358
00:23:44.481 --> 00:23:45.716
Me too.

359
00:24:11.742 --> 00:24:12.743
Hello?

360
00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:14.178
Down here.

361
00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:38.869
I didn't know there still was
a ship's Captain.


362
00:24:38.903 --> 00:24:41.806
There is not.
But don't tell anyone.


363
00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:45.910
I just like the suit.

364
00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:49.814
So, why a book about
us, exactly?


365
00:24:49.847 --> 00:24:51.816
I am a digital marketing
consultant...


366
00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:52.950
and my...

367
00:24:52.984 --> 00:24:54.919
...my son is obsessed
with ghost stories.


368
00:24:54.952 --> 00:24:56.988
A little too obsessed
actually and...


369
00:24:57.054 --> 00:24:58.856
Bittner, are you there?

370
00:24:59.056 --> 00:25:00.825
Well, er, one day
he has this dream
and he says to me,


371
00:25:00.858 --> 00:25:02.893
"Mom, I had a dream
that I was on The Queen Mary."


372
00:25:02.927 --> 00:25:04.929
And I was like,
"Oh, you know, we
should go visit."


373
00:25:05.196 --> 00:25:08.699
And he said,
"No, I had a dream
we lived there."


374
00:25:11.335 --> 00:25:12.436
Not kidding.

375
00:25:12.703 --> 00:25:14.538
And so, you know, it
got me thinking,


376
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:18.109
um, what about doing a book
from a child's perspective?


377
00:25:18.142 --> 00:25:22.513
-Hmm.
-Exploring the ship
and some of the...


378
00:25:23.447 --> 00:25:24.949
stranger stories.

379
00:25:25.516 --> 00:25:28.586
-Ghost stories?
-Yes, the ghost stories.


380
00:25:29.687 --> 00:25:32.690
And also explore the
ship's rich history


381
00:25:32.723 --> 00:25:35.926
and we could raise awareness
and we could help save it.


382
00:25:38.195 --> 00:25:40.231
I didn't know we needed saving.

383
00:25:41.165 --> 00:25:42.800
Just what I see in the media.

384
00:25:44.869 --> 00:25:45.936
Stories.

385
00:25:46.203 --> 00:25:47.772
Right. Stories.

386
00:25:50.975 --> 00:25:53.044
You know, we're pretty
used to stories
around here,


387
00:25:53.077 --> 00:25:57.481
I mean, people have said we're
a doorway for the dead.


388
00:25:57.516 --> 00:26:00.151
And although we're famous
for our fiction,


389
00:26:00.184 --> 00:26:03.187
you know, sometimes facts
can be much stranger.


390
00:26:05.122 --> 00:26:10.828
Did you know in 1942, while, er,
transporting German and
Italian prisoners,


391
00:26:11.095 --> 00:26:13.731
she collided with one of our own
escort ships?


392
00:26:13.831 --> 00:26:18.602
Sank it.
Killing all but 99 of
its 400 sailors.


393
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.474
And she just continued on
with little more than a scratch.


394
00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:26.343
Would you take me on a tour?

395
00:26:36.353 --> 00:26:37.988
Beautiful.

396
00:26:38.022 --> 00:26:40.724
Oh, yes, we have exactly
five hundred and ninety-six
working clocks


397
00:26:40.758 --> 00:26:41.859
aboard The Queen Mary.

398
00:26:41.892 --> 00:26:44.829
Wow. Really is a time
machine in here.


399
00:26:45.663 --> 00:26:47.698
We should definitely get
all these details in the book.


400
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:50.034
Well, the Queen's Salon
was a social hub at night.


401
00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:51.702
Winston Churchill used
to sit over there,


402
00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:53.704
Alfred Hitchcock drank
his martini there,


403
00:26:53.737 --> 00:26:56.006
and Bob Hope wrote his
column over there.


404
00:26:56.307 --> 00:26:57.576
Tourists, they love that.

405
00:26:57.608 --> 00:27:00.044
You know, knowing what
famous people did,


406
00:27:00.211 --> 00:27:01.112
where they went.

407
00:27:01.178 --> 00:27:03.080
Is there anything else
you can show me?


408
00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:23.861
People came here
to enjoy glamour.


409
00:28:24.195 --> 00:28:25.229
They still do.

410
00:28:25.462 --> 00:28:27.164
We host brunch on Sundays.

411
00:28:27.198 --> 00:28:29.433
Wedding receptions.
Corporate parties.


412
00:28:29.568 --> 00:28:31.735
You know, Bar-mitzvahs
and what-not.


413
00:28:32.504 --> 00:28:33.871
Oh, throughout the voyage,

414
00:28:34.238 --> 00:28:37.775
er, those ships marked
The Queen's Mary's
location along the Atlantic.


415
00:28:37.942 --> 00:28:42.547
Unfortunately, they
stopped working
after we permanently
docked in '67.


416
00:28:42.581 --> 00:28:46.450
We could capture these
fascinating details
in a wholly original way.


417
00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:48.819
Well, other people have
taken pictures.


418
00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:50.988
How do you propose
your book will be any different?


419
00:28:51.488 --> 00:28:53.958
The quality of the work
and the story you tell
with the pictures,


420
00:28:53.991 --> 00:28:55.859
that's all very important.
But...


421
00:28:56.093 --> 00:28:57.962
...have you ever thought about
virtual reality?


422
00:28:58.128 --> 00:29:00.464
Imagine taking a tour
of The Queen Mary.


423
00:29:00.798 --> 00:29:02.399
Not as it is now, but...

424
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.439
as it was in, I don't know,

425
00:29:08.506 --> 00:29:10.007
What would that entail?

426
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.743
On site time. Just the scanning.

427
00:29:12.943 --> 00:29:14.945
The coding we could
do from anywhere.


428
00:29:15.079 --> 00:29:20.818
But we would need to cover...
every inch of the ship.


429
00:29:24.723 --> 00:29:27.491
You're fucking kidding me?

430
00:29:28.325 --> 00:29:29.494
I'm sorry?

431
00:29:30.729 --> 00:29:32.363
Thank you, Miss Calder.

432
00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:35.466
I'll, er, pass this
along to Mr Torres
and we'll get back to you.


433
00:29:44.174 --> 00:29:46.443
Over here is the grand salon

434
00:29:46.477 --> 00:29:49.947
and, er, if you'll
all come this way,
we'll go to our...


435
00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.157
He seems traumatised.

436
00:30:00.424 --> 00:30:04.028
I just...sorry, I turned around,
he was just gone and I ...


437
00:30:05.497 --> 00:30:06.731
How'd the meeting go?

438
00:30:06.765 --> 00:30:08.098
Fine.

439
00:30:08.132 --> 00:30:10.434
Um, I was thinking,
if this book thing goes well,


440
00:30:10.502 --> 00:30:11.736
maybe we could try again.

441
00:30:11.802 --> 00:30:13.437
Settle down, buy a house.

442
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.040
I'm the only one still
renting at my firm, so...


443
00:30:16.373 --> 00:30:21.011
Does now feel like
the right time
to be talking about this?


444
00:30:21.713 --> 00:30:23.047
All I wanna do is know

445
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.115
that we're thinking
the same thing
for our son.


446
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:27.885
'Cause Lukas needs stability,
we, we both need stability,
right?


447
00:30:27.918 --> 00:30:29.253
There is no 'we'.

448
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:31.922
-And he's not your son.
-Come on.


449
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:33.357
We, we, we raised him together.

450
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.826
You can't just move
to another town
and shut me out.


451
00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:37.696
Stop it, it's way overdue
we all moved on.


452
00:30:37.729 --> 00:30:41.065
I, I hear what
you're saying,
but it's a house, not a prison.


453
00:30:41.098 --> 00:30:42.399
You always made it feel

454
00:30:42.433 --> 00:30:44.335
so God damn permanent.

455
00:30:44.803 --> 00:30:46.870
Jackie, darling.

456
00:30:47.204 --> 00:30:49.473
If I'm doing that I,
I'm not aware...


457
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:51.375
You mustn't worry.

458
00:30:54.178 --> 00:30:55.879
-...move to another town and...
-We have to move forward.


459
00:30:55.946 --> 00:30:58.115
You're going
to a new home.


460
00:30:58.349 --> 00:31:00.050
This is your home.

461
00:31:00.117 --> 00:31:03.954
You die here,
you stay here forever.


462
00:31:05.623 --> 00:31:07.826
Honey, are you okay?

463
00:31:07.891 --> 00:31:09.761
Wait for us there.

464
00:31:11.663 --> 00:31:15.432
And we'll be
a family again.


465
00:31:15.533 --> 00:31:17.267
We found him. No big deal.

466
00:31:17.301 --> 00:31:19.604
-He's wet.
-Yeah, I can see that.


467
00:31:19.738 --> 00:31:21.305
You know, but otherwise
unharmed.


468
00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:23.140
Come on,
let's get you home and dry.


469
00:31:23.207 --> 00:31:24.576
You poor thing.

470
00:31:24.709 --> 00:31:28.011
Miss Calder!
Wait, wait! Miss Calder!


471
00:31:44.161 --> 00:31:46.330
Miss Calder?
Charles Bittner.


472
00:31:46.363 --> 00:31:47.364
Good news.

473
00:31:47.398 --> 00:31:49.233
We'd like you and your
family to come back


474
00:31:49.266 --> 00:31:51.235
and work on that exciting
project.


475
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:54.539
Mr Torres thinks
is a great idea.


476
00:31:54.672 --> 00:31:57.575
Luckily, we've renovation
scheduled
this weekend,


477
00:31:57.609 --> 00:32:01.311
so, you'll have the, er,
the entire ship to yourself.


478
00:32:01.846 --> 00:32:05.215
♪Good times are finally back♪

479
00:32:05.583 --> 00:32:09.453
♪ Here to stay and
that's a fact ♪


480
00:32:09.754 --> 00:32:12.557
♪Living free again...♪

481
00:32:13.157 --> 00:32:16.661
♪Good times are finally back♪

482
00:32:26.036 --> 00:32:28.405
I'm on the lookout for
my next big star.


483
00:32:28.439 --> 00:32:31.108
She could be right here,
in this room,


484
00:32:31.141 --> 00:32:33.678
you just never know.

485
00:32:37.047 --> 00:32:39.316
You
just never know.


486
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:44.756
Where are you going?

487
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:47.592
How's he supposed to notice me
if I'm planted to a chair?


488
00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:49.861
I told you, we don't beg, ever.

489
00:32:49.894 --> 00:32:52.196
Well, I say let the
cards decide.


490
00:32:52.229 --> 00:32:53.898
No, we shouldn't draw attention.

491
00:32:54.499 --> 00:32:56.467
What if somebody else questions
and we've to explains things?


492
00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:57.635
-Things?
-Things.


493
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:59.203
We were offered tickets
to America
and we took 'em.


494
00:32:59.236 --> 00:33:00.805
What's wrong with that?

495
00:33:01.071 --> 00:33:03.073
They paid me to read
their fortune.


496
00:33:03.373 --> 00:33:05.543
I told them they'd die
if they left London.


497
00:33:05.577 --> 00:33:06.578
Who's to say they wouldn't?

498
00:33:06.644 --> 00:33:09.279
That was wrong.
It's not what the cards said.


499
00:33:09.848 --> 00:33:11.716
We were fine in third class.

500
00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:15.285
We don't belong there
and neither does she.


501
00:33:22.359 --> 00:33:23.628
Hmm-mm.

502
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:26.263
Now then, put that in your pipe.

503
00:33:55.459 --> 00:33:57.595
Have you seen George's new film?

504
00:33:57.795 --> 00:33:59.497
Oh, it's simply divine.

505
00:33:59.731 --> 00:34:01.733
Hepburn lights up every room.

506
00:34:02.332 --> 00:34:03.801
Including the box office.

507
00:34:03.902 --> 00:34:06.504
I don't know how to compare it
to some of his earlier pictures,


508
00:34:06.704 --> 00:34:10.207
probably not as entertaining as
Two Dinosaurs Meet
While Ice Skating.


509
00:34:10.675 --> 00:34:12.042
But it is just magical,
wouldn't you agree?


510
00:34:12.075 --> 00:34:13.511
Excuse me, Sir.

511
00:34:13.545 --> 00:34:14.979
Now, you may ask,
what is the distinction between


512
00:34:15.013 --> 00:34:16.346
subject matter and style.

513
00:34:16.446 --> 00:34:17.949
-But this is a cinematic...
-I'm a dancer.


514
00:34:17.982 --> 00:34:20.450
-...experiment in style.
-I'd to audition for
your next movie.


515
00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:22.620
What now, my dear?

516
00:34:22.654 --> 00:34:23.555
I'm a dancer.

517
00:34:23.588 --> 00:34:25.823
I'd like to audition for
your next movie.


518
00:34:25.957 --> 00:34:28.091
I'm the star
you've been looking for.


519
00:34:32.229 --> 00:34:35.332
Did your parents not teach you
that it is very rude


520
00:34:35.365 --> 00:34:39.537
to come to a table uninvited?
-Oh, Viktor. Come now.


521
00:34:48.312 --> 00:34:50.147
Good evening, your name please.

522
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.783
Mr and Mrs Howe.

523
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:54.318
Frightfully sorry I had
to cancel earlier.


524
00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:57.120
My wife is feeling
much better now.


525
00:34:57.689 --> 00:34:59.423
Is there a table still free?

526
00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:10.100
What happened?

527
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.871
Oh.

528
00:35:20.778 --> 00:35:23.146
David.

529
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.049
He once asked,
can I give him a scoop?


530
00:35:25.248 --> 00:35:27.819
A scoop, I said, of what
ice cream?!


531
00:35:27.952 --> 00:35:29.053
Well, I'm a sherbet...

532
00:35:29.087 --> 00:35:30.287
Excuse me.

533
00:35:30.955 --> 00:35:32.456
Sir, that's my girl
you just spoke to.


534
00:35:32.489 --> 00:35:35.292
She's, er, just a little upset.

535
00:35:42.533 --> 00:35:43.534
Now...

536
00:35:44.902 --> 00:35:46.638
I apologise that she
interrupted you,


537
00:35:46.671 --> 00:35:50.140
but she wants to be in movies
more than anything and, er...


538
00:35:50.307 --> 00:35:52.010
and now she's just
a little upset.


539
00:35:52.043 --> 00:35:53.978
She's talking about
abandoning her dream,


540
00:35:54.012 --> 00:35:55.680
which upset my wife.

541
00:35:55.713 --> 00:35:57.447
Oh, we're also performers.

542
00:35:59.249 --> 00:36:01.184
Now, she's a dancer.
A very good one.


543
00:36:01.385 --> 00:36:02.620
Better than that Ginger Rogers.

544
00:36:02.654 --> 00:36:04.388
-Oh, she is?
-Oh!


545
00:36:04.421 --> 00:36:07.457
You'll be doing
me a big favour
if you just reconsider.


546
00:36:07.491 --> 00:36:10.061
You, you see what see can do,
you won't be sorry.


547
00:36:22.607 --> 00:36:25.810
Please.

548
00:36:40.457 --> 00:36:41.592
Please.

549
00:36:42.894 --> 00:36:44.829
And who are you?

550
00:36:45.395 --> 00:36:47.330
My thought exactly.

551
00:36:52.436 --> 00:36:54.471
Go home.
We'll reschedule.


552
00:36:54.505 --> 00:36:56.373
Why would you
invite us here
and then tell us to go home?


553
00:36:56.406 --> 00:36:58.042
Isn't the book from
your son's perspective?


554
00:36:58.076 --> 00:36:59.309
Er, yeah, but...

555
00:36:59.376 --> 00:37:00.912
Well, so he
should be here.


556
00:37:01.012 --> 00:37:03.147
It's empty now.
It's the perfect time to do it.


557
00:37:03.213 --> 00:37:07.384
Oh, we refurbish
all the time.
Yeah, tourism is eating
this ship alive.


558
00:37:07.417 --> 00:37:09.120
People come, they take things.

559
00:37:09.286 --> 00:37:11.723
Souvenirs that cost
us a fortune.


560
00:37:13.057 --> 00:37:14.391
You know the worst offender?

561
00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:17.061
I mean, you'll laugh.

562
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:18.162
Mould.

563
00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:19.429
-What, mould?
-Hmm.


564
00:37:19.463 --> 00:37:21.933
Such a tiny nuisance, you know.

565
00:37:22.432 --> 00:37:24.736
We got leaking roofs,
dripping air ducts,


566
00:37:24.769 --> 00:37:28.472
sweating plumbing pipes
and all this...damp.


567
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.441
I mean, you wouldn't think it
when you're up there
in the fresh air.


568
00:37:31.475 --> 00:37:33.243
But below deck
is the perfect breeding ground


569
00:37:33.276 --> 00:37:36.647
for some really...
nasty organisms.


570
00:37:37.548 --> 00:37:40.952
Which might explain
why your son is sick.


571
00:37:40.985 --> 00:37:43.253
Tell me, did Lukas
mention the ship
when you got home?


572
00:37:43.286 --> 00:37:45.455
He said he left his camera
in the pool area.


573
00:37:45.489 --> 00:37:47.424
-Pool?
-His clothes were wet.


574
00:37:47.457 --> 00:37:49.193
No, pockets of stagnant water.

575
00:37:49.227 --> 00:37:50.628
Poor ventilation.

576
00:37:50.828 --> 00:37:51.863
He said the pool.

577
00:37:51.896 --> 00:37:54.098
When we docked in '67,
the boilers came out,


578
00:37:54.132 --> 00:37:55.566
so did the pool above it.

579
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.703
It was a tragedy, really.
She was a real pearl. But...


580
00:37:59.504 --> 00:38:03.306
Look, er, I know this
isn't the same
without Lukas.


581
00:38:03.641 --> 00:38:05.342
So how about when you come back,

582
00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:08.679
I'll give you a deluxe,
all access, tour.


583
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.248
With me as your guide, yeah?

584
00:38:10.447 --> 00:38:13.050
And, er, this is you.

585
00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:18.421
I had to leave my
very sick son...
at home


586
00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.326
in order to come here
because he knows this is, um...


587
00:38:24.427 --> 00:38:26.164
a last chance for us.

588
00:38:26.864 --> 00:38:29.934
I even had to call my very
unpleasant mother


589
00:38:30.134 --> 00:38:31.468
to ask her to watch him.

590
00:38:31.836 --> 00:38:35.640
And as you can imagine,
I don't like calling
her for anything.


591
00:38:36.674 --> 00:38:39.442
We are just not leaving here
empty handed...


592
00:38:40.711 --> 00:38:41.913
Captain.

593
00:38:43.714 --> 00:38:47.552
I am not asking you,
I am begging you.


594
00:38:48.318 --> 00:38:49.520
Okay.

595
00:38:50.922 --> 00:38:51.989
Okay!

596
00:38:52.924 --> 00:38:57.028
But, er, anything below M deck
is restricted.


597
00:38:57.795 --> 00:39:00.363
He's not exactly Captain
material,
is he?


598
00:39:07.939 --> 00:39:10.608
If you don't wanna do this,
I understand.


599
00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:15.412
I'm here, aren't I?

600
00:39:39.503 --> 00:39:41.639
Your mask, Sir. Remove it.

601
00:39:41.672 --> 00:39:44.075
My mask?
What does that have to
do with anything?


602
00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:45.810
There is a special place in hell

603
00:39:46.177 --> 00:39:48.246
for men who impersonate
war heroes.


604
00:39:53.784 --> 00:39:56.020
If you're not who
you claim to be,
then who are you?


605
00:40:01.491 --> 00:40:05.529
Should anything happen
to your father or I, stay here.


606
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:08.431
Come with me, Sir.

607
00:40:08.465 --> 00:40:09.901
What on earth are you doing?

608
00:40:09.934 --> 00:40:11.903
Give me your hands. Come on.

609
00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.674
...just see what she can do.
Just see what she can do.


610
00:40:19.577 --> 00:40:21.145
♪Might be a curse♪

611
00:40:21.279 --> 00:40:24.081
♪It makes your mind
all into a blur♪


612
00:40:24.148 --> 00:40:25.950
♪You won't be feeling...♪

613
00:40:27.985 --> 00:40:33.423
Your, er, film, One
Up, One Down.
Didn't think much of it.


614
00:40:34.091 --> 00:40:35.960
The plot wasn't very realistic.

615
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.162
Oh, a critic.

616
00:40:38.863 --> 00:40:42.733
This, no doubt, is why
he hides his face.


617
00:40:48.639 --> 00:40:50.341
A parent would do anything
for their child.


618
00:40:50.508 --> 00:40:53.411
Even if it requires looking
rather...foolish.


619
00:41:00.985 --> 00:41:03.754
Enjoy the rest
of your evening.


620
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.967
I told you, I told you,
I told you he'd be there.


621
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.301
-Darling.
-Yeah?


622
00:41:17.401 --> 00:41:18.836
-Your mask.
-Oh.


623
00:41:21.706 --> 00:41:23.074
D'you think she bought it?

624
00:41:23.107 --> 00:41:24.508
-Yes.
-Hmm.


625
00:41:24.542 --> 00:41:25.843
You were magnificent.

626
00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:28.245
A little part of me feels bad

to learn
to perform when it counts?


628

Still, it's one thing to have an
opportunity, it's another

With her talent,

631
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.890
she won't need to scrimp
and scrape like we did.

foot off this ship.

Yes. He was in the Varlets.

of being overly dramatic,

at the port


765

ago downstairs
I tried to give the

766
00:59:20.951 --> 00:59:23.320

-Hmm.

769
00:59:47.912 --> 00:59:50.881
I'm going to go upstairs
and try and find...


770
00:59:52.583 --> 00:59:53.918
...Cassandra.

771
00:59:55.119 --> 00:59:56.954
Perhaps she's waiting
in the playroom.


772
00:59:57.354 --> 00:59:58.355
Stay.

773
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.869
Somebody oughta tell them
to keep it down.


774
01:00:55.279 --> 01:00:57.414
Can you please keep it down?

775
01:00:58.816 --> 01:01:01.318
Or I'll call security.

780

01:03:58.929 --> 01:04:00.264
Take it.

791
01:04:04.168 --> 01:04:07.037
Just tell me.

792
01:04:32.963 --> 01:04:36.735
My service to this ship has...
come to an end.


793
01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:40.437
Thank your family
for me, will you?


794
01:04:41.673 --> 01:04:44.341
Eight years without sport was...

795
01:04:45.175 --> 01:04:47.244
...tough.

796
01:05:07.131 --> 01:05:08.966
No, no, no, no, no!

797
01:05:12.169 --> 01:05:15.038
Urgh!

So, find the exit.

807

In
a few moments,
the Ghost and Legends tour


823
01:08:24.963 --> 01:08:29.132
will disembark from
the grand staircase
on the promenade level.


824
01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:32.469
Join our resident guides
as they lead you into the depths


825
01:08:32.503 --> 01:08:37.008
of the RMS Queen Mary
in an effort to connect
with spirits


826
01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:39.376
who still call the ship home.

827
01:08:39.443 --> 01:08:44.682
Stops include the
isolation ward,
door number 13,


828
01:08:44.782 --> 01:08:46.116
the boiler room,

829
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:50.153
and the infamous B-474
state room.


830
01:08:50.454 --> 01:08:54.358
That's Ghosts and Legends
departing soon.


831
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.535
Bittner.
Yeah?


832
01:09:04.736 --> 01:09:06.638
Will you turn it down?

833
01:09:16.714 --> 01:09:17.915
It's Torres.

834
01:09:18.148 --> 01:09:20.518
Yeah?
You're closed for business?


835
01:09:20.652 --> 01:09:21.753
Yeah.

836
01:09:21.786 --> 01:09:23.621
Management is concerned.

837
01:09:23.688 --> 01:09:25.389
Yeah, we're, er...

838
01:09:26.724 --> 01:09:27.659
we're renovating.

839
01:09:27.692 --> 01:09:29.994
Must be
a pretty big job?


840
01:09:30.193 --> 01:09:33.397
Well, it's an emergency.
It's just a couple of days.


841
01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:38.036
We've creditors crawling
up our ass
threatening to call in loans.


842
01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:40.370
I mean, do we look
like Disney Land?


843
01:09:41.706 --> 01:09:45.576
Look, I've been
doing this a long
time, Mr Torres,


844
01:09:45.943 --> 01:09:49.614
and I'm telling you,
it's better to cut
a problem off at the root.


845
01:09:50.114 --> 01:09:51.649
What problem?

846
01:09:55.419 --> 01:09:57.454
Bittner, are you there?

847
01:09:59.857 --> 01:10:01.059
Bittner!

848
01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:04.929
One of our guests
stole a vessel.


849
01:10:05.262 --> 01:10:06.664
A lifeboat?

850
01:10:06.998 --> 01:10:08.533
Er, no.

851
01:10:09.734 --> 01:10:10.735
Oh?

852
01:10:11.401 --> 01:10:14.337
A little girl, er,
took one home.


853
01:10:14.872 --> 01:10:18.208
I called the parents,
requested they return it,


854
01:10:18.509 --> 01:10:20.678
but they fed me some bullshit.

855
01:10:21.211 --> 01:10:22.580
Said she wasn't coming back,

856
01:10:22.613 --> 01:10:26.084
so I need time to find out
what they know and fix it.


857
01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:29.554
Soon as I'm done,
doors will open.


858
01:10:30.188 --> 01:10:31.789
Get rid of them.

859
01:10:32.355 --> 01:10:34.759
I don't think you understand.

860
01:10:34.792 --> 01:10:36.426
No, no. We agreed.

861
01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.499
You sell The Queen
Mary experience,
tours, merchandise,
churro and whatnot,


862
01:10:41.566 --> 01:10:43.701
and we ignore whatever
goes on there.


863
01:10:43.735 --> 01:10:46.104
But if you go and make
an even bigger mess,


864
01:10:46.137 --> 01:10:47.471
that's a problem.

865
01:10:47.505 --> 01:10:49.807
Call me tomorrow
when doors are open.


866
01:10:49.841 --> 01:10:51.241
-And Bittner?
-Yeah?


867
01:10:51.274 --> 01:10:53.544
You're a security guard.
Don't fucking...


868
01:11:09.894 --> 01:11:11.461
Hey, Jesus!

869
01:11:11.496 --> 01:11:13.463
I'll make you a Manhattan later
if you want.


870
01:11:13.664 --> 01:11:15.800
I think it was the
girl's mother.


871
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.769
-Ow!
-Yeah, I believe you.


872
01:11:19.737 --> 01:11:22.573
That wasn't your son
you left with...


873
01:11:23.508 --> 01:11:24.942
Our son.

874
01:11:32.784 --> 01:11:38.089
I know you only stayed
for Lukas,
all these years.


875
01:11:38.122 --> 01:11:39.123
I know that.

876
01:11:39.157 --> 01:11:40.658
Wait, wait, please.

877
01:11:41.859 --> 01:11:42.894
But, um...

878
01:11:46.097 --> 01:11:47.632
what happens if he is here?

879
01:11:51.569 --> 01:11:53.336
Then I'll stay.

880
01:11:57.175 --> 01:11:58.475
Okay.

881
01:12:00.711 --> 01:12:04.549
It's just that I don't know
where to find the pool.


882
01:12:07.151 --> 01:12:08.351
I do.

883
01:12:10.154 --> 01:12:11.689
I think we're done here.

884
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:28.806
Anne, Captain Bittner here.

885
01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.908
Oh, hello.

886
01:12:31.175 --> 01:12:32.944
I'm sorry, the power is down.

887
01:12:32.977 --> 01:12:35.313
This whole place is a death trap
when it rains.


888
01:12:35.345 --> 01:12:36.581
Look, I called maintenance,

889
01:12:36.614 --> 01:12:38.249
but they said they won't be here
until tomorrow.


890
01:12:38.282 --> 01:12:39.550
I mean, "Tomorrow?" I said.

891
01:12:39.584 --> 01:12:41.652
"We've guests working on
a special project."


892
01:12:41.719 --> 01:12:45.823
They apologised and all,
but tomorrow's the
best they can do.


893
01:12:45.857 --> 01:12:46.891
We brought torches.

894
01:12:46.924 --> 01:12:47.825
Yeah, if it was up to me,

895
01:12:47.859 --> 01:12:49.492
I wouldn't care
if you looked around,


896
01:12:49.527 --> 01:12:51.095
but it's an insurance
risk, you know.


897
01:12:51.128 --> 01:12:53.497
Those guys, they're
a pain in the ass,
you understand?


898
01:12:53.531 --> 01:12:54.899
We'll be careful.

899
01:12:54.932 --> 01:12:56.567
Yeah, no doubt.
Still, we shouldn't
take any risks.


900
01:12:56.601 --> 01:12:58.302
Let's reschedule, I insist.

901
01:12:58.368 --> 01:13:00.605
Pour yourself a drink,
I'll come get you.


902
01:13:00.872 --> 01:13:02.907
We'll walk to your cabin,
collect your stuff.


903
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:06.409
And, er, I can tell
you about the time
Walt Disney and I smoked cigars


904
01:13:06.443 --> 01:13:09.146
in the bar until the
wee hours. Huh?


905
01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.350
Okay, Captain.

906
01:13:12.783 --> 01:13:14.819
We gotta go.

907
01:13:14.852 --> 01:13:15.987
You know what?

908
01:13:16.486 --> 01:13:18.089
Think I will have that drink.

909
01:13:24.427 --> 01:13:25.796
Hell are you going?

910
01:13:38.042 --> 01:13:40.311
Go! Clear!

911
01:13:40.344 --> 01:13:41.679
- My face!
- Move!


912
01:13:41.712 --> 01:13:43.247
- My face!
- Wait!


913
01:13:43.314 --> 01:13:45.016
Make way
for the Captain!


914
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:48.085
Give it here.

915
01:13:50.955 --> 01:13:53.257
Not...my...swally!

916
01:13:53.291 --> 01:13:54.792
Easy, easy!

917
01:13:57.395 --> 01:13:59.764
Go. Go!

918
01:14:12.243 --> 01:14:13.978
Oh God, oh God.

919
01:14:29.427 --> 01:14:30.561
Captain.

920
01:14:30.594 --> 01:14:32.096
Gibson! Bloody hell.

921
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.170
Forward generator burned out.
All the flood doors are closing.


922
01:14:39.469 --> 01:14:40.905
Shall we contact New York?

923
01:14:40.938 --> 01:14:42.472
The navy? I mean,
maybe they have a craft
in the area.


924
01:14:42.506 --> 01:14:44.075
No, no. Just,
just......


925
01:14:44.108 --> 01:14:47.078
just tell them
it's part of tonight's
entertainment.


926
01:14:47.678 --> 01:14:48.512
Sir?

927
01:14:48.679 --> 01:14:50.014
-Why aren't you upstairs?
-Well, I was.


928
01:14:50.047 --> 01:14:51.949
But an incident occurred
with one of the passengers.


929
01:14:51.983 --> 01:14:54.919
-Well, take care of it.
-There's been a murder.


930
01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:09.300
David Ratch.

931
01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:11.602
Travelling third class
with his family.


932
01:15:11.635 --> 01:15:14.872
Appears Mr Ratch lost his senses
some time after dinner.


933
01:15:14.905 --> 01:15:17.575
Found him covered in
his wife's blood
trying to launch a life vessel.


934
01:15:17.708 --> 01:15:19.477
Took three men to restrain him.

935
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:21.045
He's in the infirmary now.

936
01:15:21.445 --> 01:15:22.980
Bloody hell,
how did they get down here?


937
01:15:23.014 --> 01:15:24.548
Captain!
Why's she so slow this
evening, huh?!


938
01:15:24.582 --> 01:15:26.083
Party's upstairs, gentlemen.

939
01:15:26.117 --> 01:15:27.852
- Are we sinking?!
- Alright, alright. That'll do.


940
01:15:27.885 --> 01:15:31.055
The fastest ship, my
arse.


941
01:15:32.289 --> 01:15:33.391
Where is Mrs Ratch?

942
01:15:33.424 --> 01:15:34.925
Cabin B-474.

943
01:15:34.959 --> 01:15:37.094
Apparently, he did
it with an axe.
Made a frightful mess.


944
01:15:37.161 --> 01:15:39.597
They have a young daughter.
Our people are trying
to locate her.


945
01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:42.133
She was last seen leaving
the grand salon by herself,


946
01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:43.502
approximately eight thirty.

947
01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.510
How dare you make a joke
about my wife?!


948
01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:52.543
I wasn't...

949
01:15:54.845 --> 01:15:56.515
Sir, respectfully,
why are we here


950
01:15:56.547 --> 01:15:58.149
and not at the scene
or on the bridge?


951
01:15:58.349 --> 01:16:00.017
I needed to see for myself.

952
01:16:00.519 --> 01:16:02.521
Clock stopped at seven.

953
01:16:02.787 --> 01:16:05.289
Same time you reported
the accident downstairs.


954
01:16:06.123 --> 01:16:07.391
The prisoner say anything?

955
01:16:07.625 --> 01:16:08.626
Well, like what?

956
01:16:08.826 --> 01:16:10.928
Other than the obvious crazy?

957
01:16:11.295 --> 01:16:13.498
Was there anything
that stood out?


958
01:16:13.697 --> 01:16:15.599
Well apparently, his
friends call him
Clarky.


959
01:16:15.833 --> 01:16:18.002
Thought it was a bit odd
for someone with the
surname Ratch.


960
01:16:18.669 --> 01:16:21.572
He then used some rather
choice words
to indicate how the
officer could


961
01:16:21.605 --> 01:16:24.108
use a 'so-and-so' and insert it.

962
01:16:24.543 --> 01:16:26.210
- A cigarette?
- No.


963
01:16:27.044 --> 01:16:29.146
-Have you a cigarette, Gibson?
-Oh.


964
01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:34.652
It must be time to send an SOS.

965
01:16:36.954 --> 01:16:38.989
Have you witnessed
a ship go down?


966
01:16:40.891 --> 01:16:41.892
No.

967
01:16:42.993 --> 01:16:43.994
I have.

968
01:16:45.362 --> 01:16:47.231
My father did everything
he could.


969
01:16:48.533 --> 01:16:50.835
Gave the order within
plenty of time.


970
01:16:52.636 --> 01:16:54.171
People get scared.

971
01:16:55.507 --> 01:16:58.809
They panic...and
fight like rats.


972
01:16:59.743 --> 01:17:02.012
I won't let that happen
on this ship.


973
01:17:02.514 --> 01:17:04.315
Not while we can still save her.

974
01:17:04.782 --> 01:17:06.383
Well, shall I report
to the bridge and...


975
01:17:07.384 --> 01:17:09.086
coordinate our resources
from there?


976
01:17:11.822 --> 01:17:13.224
You don't understand.

977
01:17:15.226 --> 01:17:16.760
Our only concern now

978
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:19.230
is Mr Ratch.

979
01:17:51.695 --> 01:17:53.565
Frightfully sorry to bother you.

980
01:17:54.431 --> 01:17:57.001
But I'm supposed to
meet my husband in New York.


981
01:17:57.168 --> 01:18:00.004
And the captain said
I can't disembark.


982
01:18:01.071 --> 01:18:05.242
If you see my husband,
can you send him a message?


983
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:08.212
I need...

984
01:18:08.245 --> 01:18:09.747
Oh!

985
01:18:12.716 --> 01:18:14.451
...to leave...

986
01:18:15.986 --> 01:18:17.721
...this...

987
01:18:17.788 --> 01:18:20.357
...ship...

988
01:18:21.091 --> 01:18:23.562
I need to leave this ship,
I need to leave this ship!


989
01:18:23.595 --> 01:18:28.165
I need to
leave this ship!
I need to leave this ship!


990
01:18:28.299 --> 01:18:34.171
I need to leave this ship!
I need to leave this ship!


991
01:18:34.271 --> 01:18:37.474
I need to leave this...!

992
01:19:09.106 --> 01:19:11.775
The pool.
It's below M deck.


993
01:19:13.043 --> 01:19:15.946
Bittner, you sneaky
little prick.


994
01:19:21.819 --> 01:19:23.220
Shit.

995
01:19:23.655 --> 01:19:26.323
It's all wet. Even the scanner.

996
01:19:26.423 --> 01:19:28.392
This'll need time to dry.

997
01:19:39.671 --> 01:19:41.539
Friend of Bittner's, you think?

998
01:19:50.814 --> 01:19:53.183
You know, I thought
if we did this project together,


999
01:19:53.217 --> 01:19:56.387
you and Lukas would come home
and we'd be...


1000
01:19:56.954 --> 01:19:59.490
a...a kind of family again.

1001
01:20:00.157 --> 01:20:02.426
But honestly, the last
thing I expected


1002
01:20:03.093 --> 01:20:06.363
was to get your answer
before we even started.


1003
01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:08.465
So, I, I guess...

1004
01:20:10.067 --> 01:20:12.102
how come I wasn't enough?

1005
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:14.171
Oh no.

1006
01:20:14.706 --> 01:20:16.407
No, no, that's not what it is.

1007
01:20:16.675 --> 01:20:18.409
I just don't believe
in marriage.


1008
01:20:18.909 --> 01:20:20.311
I failed once.

1009
01:20:23.847 --> 01:20:25.684
I still want to escape.

1010
01:20:26.383 --> 01:20:30.187
It's just that the urge
to be with Lukas is stronger.


1011
01:20:36.827 --> 01:20:38.563
You know, if you stay here,

1012
01:20:39.997 --> 01:20:42.767
you'll get trapped
like that shrieking woman.


1013
01:20:45.503 --> 01:20:49.741
You'll end up as a footnote
in one of Bittner's
haunted tours.


1014
01:20:49.774 --> 01:20:52.476
A historical curiosity,
nothing more.


1015
01:20:57.549 --> 01:20:58.550
Patrick.

1016
01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:00.351
Yeah?

1017
01:21:00.851 --> 01:21:03.320
I can't leave my son alone here.

1018
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.893
Fine.

1019
01:21:10.227 --> 01:21:13.297
We can be the dead family
still walking the deck.


1020
01:22:07.786 --> 01:22:09.654
Ugh, that smell.

1021
01:23:49.119 --> 01:23:51.421
Motherfuckers!

1022
01:24:30.929 --> 01:24:32.262
Look.

1023
01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:35.700
He's still here, Patrick.

1024
01:25:01.726 --> 01:25:07.532
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1025
01:25:40.999 --> 01:25:42.366
Oh, Christ.

1026
01:25:47.939 --> 01:25:49.540
Send the distress code.

1027
01:25:49.574 --> 01:25:52.442
It won't
make a difference,
don't you see?


1028
01:25:52.476 --> 01:25:56.581
The man roaming freely
is why the ship is faltering.


1029
01:26:06.891 --> 01:26:08.225
Hello?

1030
01:26:09.761 --> 01:26:11.328
Miss Calder?

1031
01:26:20.071 --> 01:26:21.806
Are you alright in there?

1032
01:26:49.934 --> 01:26:51.334
Oh, fuck!

1033
01:26:58.375 --> 01:27:00.945
Wow, he used
the whole roll.


1034
01:27:01.211 --> 01:27:02.547
Be careful.

1035
01:27:12.724 --> 01:27:14.959
I need to know
what Bittner's hiding.


1036
01:27:21.032 --> 01:27:22.633
Is that it?

1037
01:27:23.768 --> 01:27:24.936
Damn.

1038
01:27:25.235 --> 01:27:27.237
I've never seen a doorway to...

1039
01:27:28.106 --> 01:27:29.406
...fuck knows.

1040
01:27:33.978 --> 01:27:35.245
Anything?

1041
01:27:39.382 --> 01:27:42.687
Is that a...child?

1042
01:27:44.722 --> 01:27:45.823
No.

1043
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:49.794
No, judging by the size,
I'd say an adult.


1044
01:27:50.862 --> 01:27:51.929
And it's in the structure,

1045
01:27:51.963 --> 01:27:53.798
so probably from the time
the ship was built.


1046
01:27:54.098 --> 01:27:56.501
Also, there's no way
they could put the metal
poles in there


1047
01:27:56.534 --> 01:27:58.669
after pouring the concrete.
Which...


1048
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:01.672
...which tells me the workers
knew about it.


1049
01:28:03.306 --> 01:28:05.243
Or they did it.

1050
01:28:05.308 --> 01:28:11.348
After Wall
Street tumbled in
'29, Clydebank shipyard
closed its doors.


1051
01:28:12.315 --> 01:28:15.720
While this vessel was
just bare bones.


1052
01:28:17.755 --> 01:28:21.225
The ship spent three long years
overlooking that town.


1053
01:28:21.259 --> 01:28:22.527
Like a coffin.

1054
01:28:23.027 --> 01:28:24.494
As if they needed reminding

1055
01:28:25.096 --> 01:28:28.331
what would happen if her future
couldn't be secured.


1056
01:28:29.667 --> 01:28:31.969
Then with the nation's
pride at stake,


1057
01:28:32.637 --> 01:28:35.372
the British Government
stepped in
with a financial commitment,


1058
01:28:35.405 --> 01:28:36.874
to guarantee completion.

1059
01:28:38.308 --> 01:28:41.344
With Clydebank's
future at stake,


1060
01:28:42.113 --> 01:28:43.681
the workers stepped in.

1061
01:28:44.515 --> 01:28:46.517
To guarantee her success.

1062
01:28:47.685 --> 01:28:49.854
And that of future generations.

1063
01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:54.725
Crime locks many doors.

1064
01:28:57.995 --> 01:28:59.530
But for one prisoner,

1065
01:29:00.832 --> 01:29:02.432
it required...

1066
01:29:04.101 --> 01:29:05.303
sacrifice.

1067
01:29:05.335 --> 01:29:07.839
Foundation sacrifice,
to be exact.


1068
01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.374
According to an old engineering
tradition,


1069
01:29:11.474 --> 01:29:12.977
to guarantee structural
integrity,


1070
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:15.880
one ought to bury a human
inside of the walls.


1071
01:29:16.047 --> 01:29:18.115
And the more pain he suffers,

1072
01:29:20.251 --> 01:29:21.953
the greater the bind...

1073
01:29:23.287 --> 01:29:24.989
...between his spirit...

1074
01:29:25.857 --> 01:29:27.058
and the ship.

1075
01:29:27.592 --> 01:29:30.493
Until both are inseparable.

1076
01:29:35.166 --> 01:29:39.237
The workers selected
their victim,
Edward Clark.


1077
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:41.672
Or Clarky as he was
known to them.


1078
01:29:42.106 --> 01:29:46.978
A riveter and former inmate,
rumoured to have murdered.


1079
01:29:47.678 --> 01:29:51.749
They inflicted on him
the most miserable of ends.


1080
01:29:53.651 --> 01:29:55.620
His sacrifice protected them.

1081
01:30:04.862 --> 01:30:07.999
Gave them the success
and peace of mind


1082
01:30:08.132 --> 01:30:10.034
they so badly craved.

1083
01:30:14.205 --> 01:30:15.606
That's a real thing?

1084
01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.341
What, foundation sacrifice?

1085
01:30:17.375 --> 01:30:19.210
Yeah.

1086
01:30:19.243 --> 01:30:21.812
Well, it's not exactly
on the curriculum at university,


1087
01:30:21.846 --> 01:30:23.247
but yeah, sure.

1088
01:30:23.681 --> 01:30:25.950
From time-to-time cases
have occurred.


1089
01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:27.551
I mean, it's an open secret.

1090
01:30:27.652 --> 01:30:29.987
Even kids' rhymes are about it.

1091
01:30:30.087 --> 01:30:32.156
London Bridge keeps
falling down until...


1092
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:34.792
Until they lock
a man inside.


1093
01:30:34.825 --> 01:30:37.862
Yeah.
Folklore based on
a grain of truth.


1094
01:30:38.663 --> 01:30:40.430
My God, that is barbaric.

1095
01:30:40.765 --> 01:30:43.200
And you actually believe
we're unsinkable?!


1096
01:30:45.236 --> 01:30:48.506
Might explain
how the ship
survived a World War


1097
01:30:49.106 --> 01:30:51.676
a dozen botched face lifts,

1098
01:30:52.143 --> 01:30:53.511
a rogue wave.

1099
01:30:55.246 --> 01:31:01.052
rTo reinstate the ship's power,
we must reinstate Mr Clark,


1100
01:31:01.619 --> 01:31:05.056
and kill whatever
flesh he is in.


1101
01:31:18.436 --> 01:31:19.904
Should we fail...

1102
01:31:21.339 --> 01:31:24.241
...your question as to whether
this ship is unsinkable...


1103
01:31:26.911 --> 01:31:29.647
...will most certainly
be answered.


1104
01:31:35.353 --> 01:31:36.554
Oh, my God!

1105
01:31:37.455 --> 01:31:39.890
Oh, my fucking God.

1106
01:31:41.892 --> 01:31:44.261
Shit!

1107
01:31:47.765 --> 01:31:48.632
Lukas?!

1108
01:31:48.666 --> 01:31:49.867
Patrick!

1109
01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:50.735
I see him.

1110
01:31:50.768 --> 01:31:52.603
-Baby, come back!
-Wait!


1111
01:32:08.586 --> 01:32:09.854
Anne!

1112
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:22.199
Anne? Are you there?

1113
01:32:32.309 --> 01:32:35.546
Patrick, come in! Patrick.

1114
01:32:35.579 --> 01:32:36.781
Yeah, I'm here.

1115
01:32:39.216 --> 01:32:42.119
I followed Lukas to an elevator,
but he's gone.


1116
01:32:42.486 --> 01:32:43.754
Where are you?

1117
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:48.993
I don't know, er,
cabin numbers are E-100s.


1118
01:32:49.093 --> 01:32:50.728
Okay, stay where you are...

1119
01:34:03.134 --> 01:34:05.202
Clear the
way, coming through!


1120
01:34:05.769 --> 01:34:06.904
Keep moving, upstairs.

1121
01:34:06.937 --> 01:34:08.672
And follow the safety orders.

1122
01:34:13.978 --> 01:34:15.146
Where is it?

1123
01:34:38.135 --> 01:34:39.303
Come on!

1124
01:34:45.376 --> 01:34:46.477
Keep moving!

1125
01:34:46.545 --> 01:34:48.312
Out of the way! 
Coming through!

1126
01:35:17.408 --> 01:35:20.177
You're not from
here, are you?


1127
01:35:23.648 --> 01:35:26.917
I'm sorry, excuse
my impertinence.


1128
01:35:27.952 --> 01:35:29.554
- Mum?
- Stay with us, please.


1129
01:35:29.621 --> 01:35:30.622
Lukas?

1130
01:35:30.655 --> 01:35:31.989
If you wish to stay,

1131
01:35:32.122 --> 01:35:34.091
y- y- you could take my place!

1132
01:35:34.124 --> 01:35:36.595
I really don't mind!

1133
01:35:36.961 --> 01:35:40.130
It's wonderful,
wonderful fun!


1134
01:35:40.431 --> 01:35:41.999
And I could leave...

1135
01:35:42.733 --> 01:35:44.735
just for
a little while.


1136
01:35:44.768 --> 01:35:46.470
You don't understand!

1137
01:35:46.504 --> 01:35:47.805
I've been here for so long!

1138
01:35:47.838 --> 01:35:49.507
I promise,
I'll come back.


1139
01:35:49.541 --> 01:35:51.175
None of this is real.

1140
01:35:51.775 --> 01:35:53.911
- None of this is real.
- Need your body!


1141
01:35:53.944 --> 01:35:55.614
But I need you more!

1142
01:35:55.913 --> 01:35:57.682
Why should you go and not me?!

1143
01:35:57.716 --> 01:35:59.850
Fuck me.
People are waiting for me!


1144
01:36:00.017 --> 01:36:02.353
Please! I'm begging you!

1145
01:36:02.386 --> 01:36:03.487
Lukas!

1146
01:36:03.521 --> 01:36:04.855
Where are you?!

1147
01:36:06.757 --> 01:36:08.225
Give me your body!

1148
01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:12.530
I must get off
of this boat!


1149
01:36:14.999 --> 01:36:16.267
Stop!

1150
01:36:17.167 --> 01:36:18.802
Where are you?

1151
01:36:22.973 --> 01:36:25.276
I thought you'd gone home.

1152
01:36:28.613 --> 01:36:29.714
Er...

1153
01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.249
yeah, we got lost
on the way out.


1154
01:36:36.755 --> 01:36:38.489
Have you seen Anne anywhere?

1155
01:36:39.223 --> 01:36:40.357
No.

1156
01:36:45.262 --> 01:36:46.330
Who's that?

1157
01:36:46.531 --> 01:36:48.032
That's nobody.

1158
01:36:51.168 --> 01:36:52.169
You sure?

1159
01:36:52.637 --> 01:36:53.837
Yeah.

1160
01:36:56.874 --> 01:36:58.475
So, so that...

1161
01:36:58.777 --> 01:37:00.578
that's not her on the trolley?

1162
01:37:01.412 --> 01:37:02.514
Oh, him?

1163
01:37:03.581 --> 01:37:05.449
No, it's just, er...

1164
01:37:07.151 --> 01:37:12.122
just some vagrant I caught,
er, sneaking around.


1165
01:37:16.695 --> 01:37:18.095
Okay.

1166
01:37:19.096 --> 01:37:20.364
Okay.

1167
01:37:20.397 --> 01:37:23.067
Er, we, we found the
swimming pool,
by the way.


1168
01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.737
You're right, she's,
she's a, she's a pearl.


1169
01:37:26.236 --> 01:37:29.674
And the, er, little brat
who absconded in your
son's place?


1170
01:37:29.708 --> 01:37:31.308
She told us everything.

1171
01:37:33.778 --> 01:37:35.879
Now, I was hoping you'd, er,
return with her,


1172
01:37:35.913 --> 01:37:39.517
so I could give you back
your son.


1173
01:37:42.587 --> 01:37:44.021
We left instructions.

1174
01:37:44.054 --> 01:37:46.023
If we don't walk out
of here tomorrow,
call the cops.


1175
01:37:46.056 --> 01:37:48.292
Tell them everything. Okay?

1176
01:37:48.459 --> 01:37:53.864
So even if that was true,
who'd believe her stories?


1177
01:37:53.931 --> 01:37:59.002
Well, actually,
a lot of people would.


1178
01:37:59.870 --> 01:38:02.674
Whatever secrets you've kept
hidden down here,


1179
01:38:02.707 --> 01:38:04.108
Lukas saw.

1180
01:38:04.375 --> 01:38:05.643
Okay, he saw them.

1181
01:38:07.878 --> 01:38:09.213
Give that to me.

1182
01:38:09.279 --> 01:38:10.615
No. No, no, no.

1183
01:38:10.815 --> 01:38:14.184
Not until we're safely
off the ship.


1184
01:38:25.262 --> 01:38:28.198
Move, move, move!
Where's that boy?


1185
01:38:31.803 --> 01:38:33.303
Clarky!

1186
01:38:42.312 --> 01:38:45.315
As we approach
the next stop of our tour,


1187
01:38:45.382 --> 01:38:47.619
we are reminded in these
hallowed halls


1188
01:38:47.652 --> 01:38:51.088
of how insignificant
we really are.


1189
01:38:51.121 --> 01:38:53.892
When even a ship as hardy
as the Queen Mary


1190
01:38:53.924 --> 01:38:55.926
could be brought to her knees.

1191
01:38:56.226 --> 01:39:00.164
The year 1942,
she was en route to Scotland


1192
01:39:00.197 --> 01:39:03.535
with ten thousand, three hundred
and ninety-eight soldiers,


1193
01:39:03.568 --> 01:39:06.538
and nine hundred and fifty
crew on board.


1194
01:39:06.704 --> 01:39:11.008
Duly recorded on the ship's log
is the date and time,


1195
01:39:11.175 --> 01:39:14.646
the course, the destination,
weather conditions,


1196
01:39:15.012 --> 01:39:16.514
temperature,

1197
01:39:16.548 --> 01:39:18.550
longitude and latitude.

1198
01:39:18.683 --> 01:39:23.420
But what is never recorded
is the fear that washes
over a deck


1199
01:39:23.588 --> 01:39:25.389
like fog and ocean spray,

1200
01:39:25.422 --> 01:39:28.492
as a ninety foot rogue
wave appears.


1201
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:32.329
Yes, the RMS Queen Mary
is a frightened ship,


1202
01:39:32.362 --> 01:39:37.167
and she carries with her
a premonition...of death.


1203
01:40:29.821 --> 01:40:32.790
Lukas. Oh, Lukas, baby.

1204
01:40:33.958 --> 01:40:35.259
Is that you?

1205
01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:38.061
Is that you?

1206
01:40:42.199 --> 01:40:45.603
What happened to Jackie,
Mommy?


1207
01:41:00.852 --> 01:41:01.886
Where are you?

1208
01:41:02.052 --> 01:41:03.220
Anne, please come in.

1209
01:41:03.253 --> 01:41:04.722
Fuck.

1210
01:41:10.795 --> 01:41:12.195
Oh.

1211
01:41:19.504 --> 01:41:20.538
Lukas?

1212
01:41:22.105 --> 01:41:23.373
Where are you?

1213
01:41:45.095 --> 01:41:47.197
Keep moving and stay calm.

1214
01:41:47.431 --> 01:41:49.299
It's all part of the show!

1215
01:41:51.936 --> 01:41:53.136
Move!

1216
01:41:54.639 --> 01:41:56.206
Move, move, move!

1217
01:42:02.513 --> 01:42:04.281
Don't let
him off the ship!


1218
01:42:08.118 --> 01:42:09.520
Reverse the winch.

1219
01:42:12.023 --> 01:42:15.093
No, lower it! Lower it!

1220
01:42:27.772 --> 01:42:30.908
Mom, why can't I move on?

1221
01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:33.611
Oh, Lukas baby.

1222
01:42:34.112 --> 01:42:36.413
Jackie told me what happened.

1223
01:42:37.081 --> 01:42:39.617
We left him in the pool.

1224
01:42:40.985 --> 01:42:42.720
- To rot...
- with the others.


1225
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:47.290
Dad used to say...

1226
01:42:49.359 --> 01:42:52.830
...opportunity is
slippery


1227
01:42:53.831 --> 01:42:55.533
Like...

1228
01:42:56.433 --> 01:42:58.503
Like trying to catch a fish...

1229
01:42:59.369 --> 01:43:00.938
with your bare hands.

1230
01:43:02.073 --> 01:43:06.343
No matter
how much it begs,


1231
01:43:08.813 --> 01:43:10.447
tries to slip away,

1232
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:14.686
hold on tight.

1233
01:43:20.992 --> 01:43:23.427
And don't be afraid

1234
01:43:24.428 --> 01:43:27.397
to get your hands dirty.

1235
01:43:27.665 --> 01:43:32.469
Where...is...she?

1236
01:43:35.173 --> 01:43:37.809
She's waiting for her mom.

1237
01:43:41.478 --> 01:43:44.882
Stay with me...forever.

1238
01:43:45.850 --> 01:43:47.719
We'll be a family again.

1239
01:43:49.087 --> 01:43:52.222
Yes, I'll stay.

1240
01:44:03.333 --> 01:44:05.570
It's useless trying
to leave, Clarky.


1241
01:44:05.603 --> 01:44:08.172
Even if I have to swim,
I'm getting off this ship.


1242
01:44:18.516 --> 01:44:24.055
Outside, there are laws
and obstacles to freedom.


1243
01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:26.090
Inside, there's only her.

1244
01:44:33.131 --> 01:44:34.766
I served my time.

1245
01:44:37.367 --> 01:44:39.336
I served my time!

1246
01:44:41.706 --> 01:44:43.040
I served my time!

1247
01:44:43.273 --> 01:44:45.342
You're the guardian, Clarky.

1248
01:44:45.743 --> 01:44:48.780
It's what they call
'a job for life'!


1249
01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:52.884
-Gibson!
-Captain, the man is unarmed!


1250
01:44:53.050 --> 01:44:54.185
Let go, you fool.

1251
01:44:54.218 --> 01:44:56.654
Or he'll take us all
to a watery grave.


1252
01:45:00.158 --> 01:45:01.726
Captain! Lower your rifle,

1253
01:45:01.759 --> 01:45:04.494
or I will have you
forcibly removed
and relieved of your duties.


1254
01:45:04.595 --> 01:45:06.864
If you are unwilling
to perform your duty,


1255
01:45:07.031 --> 01:45:08.599
I won't hesitate.

1256
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:23.313
Get back in your box!

1257
01:46:04.487 --> 01:46:05.823
Play something.

1258
01:46:09.293 --> 01:46:10.795
Something nice.

Oh, fuck!

1276
01:51:15.933 --> 01:51:17.668
Oh, Captain Bittner.

1277
01:51:26.677 --> 01:51:28.279
Perhaps you can tell us.

1278
01:51:29.614 --> 01:51:30.814
Yeah?

1279
01:51:31.148 --> 01:51:32.183
Your secret?

1280
01:51:34.018 --> 01:51:36.420
I'm afraid I, er, I
don't know what...


1281
01:51:36.687 --> 01:51:39.123
I, I don't know what
you mean, I...


1282
01:51:40.791 --> 01:51:43.394
As the ship's longest
serving employee,


1283
01:51:43.727 --> 01:51:45.896
how she survived for so long?

1284
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:55.239
Well, er,

1285
01:51:55.306 --> 01:52:00.311
young lady, I can, er,
I can recommend just the book.


1286
01:52:00.978 --> 01:52:02.846
Available from our gift shop!

1287
01:52:04.215 --> 01:52:06.350
Okay, who wants a picture?
Come on, bring it in.


1288
01:52:06.417 --> 01:52:07.519
There you go.

1289
01:52:07.686 --> 01:52:10.988
This your first time
with a captain?


1290
01:52:12.723 --> 01:52:14.825
Ah.

1291
01:52:22.132 --> 01:52:23.300
Where is she?

1292
01:52:23.434 --> 01:52:24.502
She?

1293
01:52:24.569 --> 01:52:26.904
He. My son.

1294
01:52:28.439 --> 01:52:30.874
We would like to
speak with you about
the statement


1295
01:52:30.908 --> 01:52:33.844
you provided detectives
three days ago.


1296
01:52:37.214 --> 01:52:39.950
After Lukas climbed out
his bedroom window,


1297
01:52:40.117 --> 01:52:42.621
you said he accidentally
slipped.


1298
01:52:44.488 --> 01:52:45.523
And fell.

1299
01:52:46.056 --> 01:52:49.360
Well, a neighbour
has come forward
with an account


1300
01:52:49.493 --> 01:52:51.862
which...contradicts yours.

1301
01:52:52.029 --> 01:52:55.366
Help me! Please!

1302
01:52:56.066 --> 01:52:58.235
I'm sorry about your boy.

1303
01:53:01.405 --> 01:53:02.973
I had to escape.

1304
01:53:08.279 --> 01:53:09.280
No.

1305
01:53:11.282 --> 01:53:12.283
No, no.

1306
01:53:14.084 --> 01:53:15.085
No...er...

1307
01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:20.190
We, er...we escaped.

1308
01:53:23.027 --> 01:53:24.395
Miss Calder.

1309
01:53:24.428 --> 01:53:25.829
Sir, we, we escaped.

1310
01:53:25.896 --> 01:53:27.197
Miss Calder,

1311
01:53:27.231 --> 01:53:29.300
you're being charged with
second degree murder.


1312
01:53:37.341 --> 01:53:39.410
You have the right
to remain silent.


1313
01:53:39.711 --> 01:53:41.245
Anything you say can

1314
01:53:41.278 --> 01:53:44.281
and will be used against you
in a court of law.


1315
01:53:45.082 --> 01:53:46.817
You have the right
to an attorney...


1316
01:53:55.059 --> 01:53:56.060
Hmm.

1317
01:53:59.664 --> 01:54:01.131
Hmm.

1318
01:54:01.666 --> 01:54:03.133
Hmm.

1319
01:54:06.970 --> 01:54:08.540
Miss Calder?

1320
01:54:11.842 --> 01:54:13.877
Miss Calder?

1321
01:54:23.921 --> 01:54:25.557
Captain Bittner for Torres.

1322
01:54:25.690 --> 01:54:26.691
Please hold.

1323
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:47.144
Mr Torres on line two.

1324
01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:51.750
Bittner? You there?

1325
01:54:51.783 --> 01:54:52.784
In the flesh.

1326
01:55:23.447 --> 01:55:25.349
They lived their hopes
and dreams


1327
01:55:25.382 --> 01:55:28.586
buried in her lavish woods
and polished decks.


1328
01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:34.458
Now, resting and all
but forgotten,
they wait to return to life.


1329
01:55:35.926 --> 01:55:39.296
In a few moments,
the new Ghosts and Legends tour,


1330
01:55:39.329 --> 01:55:40.732
No Escape,

1331
01:55:40.765 --> 01:55:44.368
will disembark from
the grand staircase
on the promenade level.


1332
01:55:45.035 --> 01:55:46.738
Join our resident guides

1333
01:55:46.771 --> 01:55:50.374
as they lead you into the depths
of the RMS Queen Mary


1334
01:55:50.407 --> 01:55:55.513
in an effort to connect
with spirits
who still call this ship home.


1335
01:55:56.079 --> 01:56:01.285
That's Ghosts and Legends,
No Escape, departing soon.
