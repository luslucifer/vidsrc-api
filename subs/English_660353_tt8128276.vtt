The only disruptive
sounds were nine evil jets.

it is very annoying.</i>


22

Need a ride, Ted?

35
00:15:47.754 --> 00:15:50.422
I can't get this,
uh... I can't get this around.


36
00:15:50.455 --> 00:15:52.190
- It's not...
- Ted, it doesn't work.


37
00:15:52.224 --> 00:15:54.627
- Huh?
- It's broke, it's broke.


38
00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:00.065
Just hold on real tight.

39
00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:03.468
Whoa!

40
00:16:07.372 --> 00:16:09.107
I couldn't help myself.

54
00:17:43.502 --> 00:17:45.370
Hi. Hi, Ma, it's me.

55
00:17:46.405 --> 00:17:48.407
It's so hot.

56
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:52.244
No, it's okay, it's always...
it always does this,


57
00:17:52.277 --> 00:17:54.546
but I only had $1.50
and I'm going to run


58
00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:57.449
out of time before
we finish the conversation.


59
00:17:57.482 --> 00:17:59.786
Nothing. I just...
I just want to talk to him.


60
00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:01.654
I just turned my back on him.

61
00:18:01.688 --> 00:18:04.657
Wouldn't talk to him.
Yeah, well, that's his issue.


62
00:18:04.691 --> 00:18:06.893
He shouldn't...
He shouldn't have got married.


63
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.394
He shouldn't
have married her, Ma.


64
00:18:09.428 --> 00:18:10.797
She's a bad influence on him.

65
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.330
If that's
not obvious to you now,


66
00:18:12.364 --> 00:18:13.633
it will be in the future.

67
00:18:15.534 --> 00:18:17.569
Well, I still love him,
Ma, but I don't...


68
00:18:17.602 --> 00:18:19.504
I have nothing
in common with David.


69
00:18:19.538 --> 00:18:21.506
He was jealous of the fact
that I could do most


70
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.775
things better than he could.

71
00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:24.342
It's a simple fact, Ma.

72
00:18:25.712 --> 00:18:28.246
Well, yeah, he was better
socially than I was, but...


73
00:18:29.314 --> 00:18:31.884
Well, if you hadn't put me
two years ahead in high school,


74
00:18:31.918 --> 00:18:34.419
perhaps I would have
the ability to... to hold


75
00:18:34.453 --> 00:18:37.289
a conversation with a woman
longer than 30 seconds.


76
00:18:37.322 --> 00:18:38.658
Two relationships in my life.

77
00:18:38.691 --> 00:18:41.293
Two. I only
got to first base, Ma.


78
00:18:41.326 --> 00:18:42.561
You know what first base is?

79
00:18:42.594 --> 00:18:44.329
Yeah, kissing, tongue rubbing.

80
00:18:44.362 --> 00:18:48.467
Yeah.
I have tongue rubbed twice.


81
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.304
Twice. That's all. Nothing.
No... no touching of breasts.


82
00:18:52.337 --> 00:18:53.706
No sexual intercourse.

83
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.273
Well,
who do you want me to tell?


84
00:18:55.307 --> 00:18:56.541
Who should I tell this to, Ma?

85
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.746
Fuck, there's people...

86
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.049
There's people listening.

87
00:19:03.082 --> 00:19:05.718
I just need to know if you're
going to send me money, Ma.


88
00:19:05.752 --> 00:19:07.419
Please, I'm desperate.

89
00:19:07.452 --> 00:19:09.922
All right,
please send me a check.


90
00:19:11.624 --> 00:19:15.628
Oh, for the love of God,
is that a yes or no?


91
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.065
Thank you.

92
00:19:19.098 --> 00:19:20.700
And do not send...
no, do not send food


93
00:19:20.733 --> 00:19:22.400
with the check,
just a check, Ma.


94
00:19:22.434 --> 00:19:24.036
I have to go.

95
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.805
The beeping... The phone...
It's the phone company, Ma.


96
00:19:25.838 --> 00:19:27.707
It's the phone company.
I can't. I have to go.

00:31:45.277 --> 00:31:48.213
<i>but the difference is that
I am now able to strike back</i>


158
00:31:48.247 --> 00:31:50.015
<i>to a degree.</i>

159
00:31:51.083 --> 00:31:55.454
<i>True, I can't strike back
to anything like the extent</i>


160
00:31:55.487 --> 00:31:58.223
<i>I wish to, but I no longer
feel totally helpless,</i>


161
00:31:58.257 --> 00:32:01.527
<i>and the anger doesn't
gnaw my guts as it used to.</i>


162
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.799
<i>Guilty feelings? 
Yes, a little.</i>

163
00:32:06.833 --> 00:32:10.670
<i>Occasionally, I have bad dreams
in which police are after me,</i>


164
00:32:10.703 --> 00:32:13.505
<i>or which I am threatened
with punishment</i>


165
00:32:13.539 --> 00:32:16.809
<i>from a supernatural source
such as the devil.</i>


166
00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:21.413
<i>But these don't occur
often enough to be a problem.</i>


167
00:32:22.682 --> 00:32:26.786
<i>I am definitely glad
to have done what I have.</i>


168
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.467
Here comes a tough one.

169
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.370
So, four numbers.

170
00:34:59.571 --> 00:35:01.540
Keeping the seven
in the same place.


171
00:35:01.573 --> 00:35:03.275
Mm-hmm.

172
00:35:03.308 --> 00:35:05.610
Create the greatest
and the smallest number


173
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:07.914
in a combination
of those four digits.


174
00:35:07.947 --> 00:35:09.782
I'm going to give you a hint.

175
00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.483
The zero, seven, five,
four is a three-digit number.


176
00:35:12.584 --> 00:35:13.820
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.


177
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:16.455
Mm-hmm.

178
00:35:16.889 --> 00:35:18.758
Yeah, what's the greatest
and smallest number


179
00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:20.727
for those four digits?

180
00:35:26.598 --> 00:35:27.834
Mm-hmm.

181
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.370
Nice. Remarkable.

182
00:35:34.573 --> 00:35:35.808
That's fantastic.

183
00:35:36.709 --> 00:35:40.445
The smallest.
He's really coming along.


184
00:35:40.479 --> 00:35:42.014
He is really smart.

185
00:35:42.048 --> 00:35:43.750
I think you've
probably done enough.


186
00:35:43.783 --> 00:35:46.853
Yeah. All this math
does give me a headache.


187
00:35:46.886 --> 00:35:48.621
That's what we want.

188
00:36:28.094 --> 00:36:31.097
<i>In Montana,
if I went to the city to mail</i>


189
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:34.734

00:36:37.469 --> 00:36:41.007
<i>In the anonymity of the big

192
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.011
<i>much safer to buy materials
for a bomb and mail it.</i>


193
00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:39.364
I wanna fuck you.

194
00:37:39.899 --> 00:37:42.134
I want to fuck you too, yeah.

195
00:37:46.739 --> 00:37:51.878
Nice ass. Nice tits. Face, meh.

196
00:37:56.883 --> 00:37:58.918
I could end this bitch.

198
00:38:47.499 --> 00:38:49.835
The psychology of women.

199
00:38:49.869 --> 00:38:52.004

200
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:54.206

- Oh, yeah?


201
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.741
Mm-hmm.

202
00:38:55.775 --> 00:38:58.543
- What do you do?
- I'm a psychiatrist.


203
00:38:58.576 --> 00:39:00.545
- No shit.
- Yeah.


204
00:39:03.115 --> 00:39:05.017
Please do not
tell me your troubles.


205
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:07.519
Right.

206
00:39:09.789 --> 00:39:11.757
What do you...
what do you do for a living?


207
00:39:13.693 --> 00:39:16.528
I just got out of prison.
I gotta go get a job.


208
00:39:16.561 --> 00:39:17.830
Sure.

209
00:39:26.639 --> 00:39:29.642
Maybe I'll go
be a psychiatrist now.


210
00:39:32.945 --> 00:39:36.649
Um, excuse me,
I have to...


211
00:39:36.682 --> 00:39:38.050
Hey.

212
00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:40.853

the fuck out of here.

214
00:40:31.203 --> 00:40:34.640

216
00:40:36.042 --> 00:40:41.080

- It's Conrad. Joseph Conrad.


217
00:40:42.915 --> 00:40:46.584
- Um, how much?
- $19.95.


218
00:41:04.804 --> 00:41:06.072
A nickel?

219
00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:08.774
Change?

220

00:41:12.078 --> 00:41:13.312

00:49:44.222 --> 00:49:46.124
<i>It didn't help much.</i>

313
00:49:46.158 --> 00:49:48.293
<i>It's a vacant lot.
So, police are hoping</i>


314
00:49:48.327 --> 00:49:51.430
<i>for better luck with clues
the explosion left behind.</i>


315
00:49:51.463 --> 00:49:54.667
<i>Today, inside
Wood's home, investigators</i>


316
00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:56.501
<i>finished picking up
pieces of the bomb.</i>


317
00:49:56.535 --> 00:49:58.638
<i>That was nerve-wracking.</i>

318
00:49:58.671 --> 00:50:00.472
<i>Metal fragments were scattered
throughout the kitchen and had</i>


319
00:50:00.505 --> 00:50:02.274
<i>to be separated
from bits of glass and paper.</i>


320
00:50:02.307 --> 00:50:04.343
<i>The evidence
recovered from the home</i>


321
00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:07.880
<i>of Mr. Hood... Mr. Wood was
in good condition and has been</i>


322
00:50:07.914 --> 00:50:09.849
<i>dispatched by courier to
the Postal Inspection</i>


323
00:50:09.882 --> 00:50:12.551
<i>Service Crime Laboratory
in Washington, DC.</i>


324
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.487
<i>The parcel wrapping,</i>

325
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.489
<i>the packing and portions
of the bomb itself</i>


326
00:50:17.522 --> 00:50:20.425
<i>will be analyzed by
the laboratory technicians</i>


327
00:50:20.459 --> 00:50:23.362
<i>and they will
furnish us a full report.</i>


328
00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:25.430
<i>At this time, we are unable</i>

329
00:50:25.464 --> 00:50:28.333
<i>to release any details
on the make up of the bomb.</i>


330
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:31.938
<i>We have initiated
an intense investigation</i>


331
00:50:31.971 --> 00:50:34.239
<i>to solve the attack
upon Mr. Wood.</i>


332
00:50:34.272 --> 00:50:36.541
<i>Recently,
Percy Wood outfitted his home</i>


333
00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:38.911
<i>with an electronic
security system</i>


334
00:50:38.945 --> 00:50:40.479
<i>and he probably wouldn't
open the front door</i>


335
00:50:40.512 --> 00:50:42.649
<i>if a stranger was outside.</i>

336
00:50:42.682 --> 00:50:44.717
<i>Like most of us,
though, he opens mail.</i>


337
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:46.184
<i>Not knowing what's inside.</i>

338
00:50:46.218 --> 00:50:48.453
<i>"It will never happen to me,"</i>

339
00:50:48.487 --> 00:50:51.256
<i>is the way that
most people look at it.</i>


340
00:50:51.289 --> 00:50:54.292
<i>Yourself, how many times
have you opened your mail</i>


341
00:50:54.326 --> 00:50:57.195
<i>and thought that there might
have been something in it?</i>


342
00:51:11.978 --> 00:51:14.312
Ugh!

343
00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:20.485
Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:51:36.636 --> 00:51:37.837
<i>Helping hand.</i>

345
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:39.806
<i>You got a...</i>

346
00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:42.607
<i>Yeah, I'm fucking angry
with the car, asshole.</i>


347
00:51:43.843 --> 00:51:45.845
<i>You wanna know
who told us my wife?</i>


348
00:51:45.878 --> 00:51:47.647
<i>Your goddamn brother.</i>

349
00:54:17.864 --> 00:54:20.532
<i>Dynamite blast all over him.</i>

350
00:54:21.868 --> 00:54:24.502
<i>Occasionally autumn at my cabin.</i>

351
00:54:25.838 --> 00:54:29.809
<i>Exxon conducting
seismic exploration for oil.</i>


352
00:54:36.581 --> 00:54:39.752
<i>Couple of helicopters
flying all over the hills.</i>


353
00:54:39.785 --> 00:54:41.921
<i>Lower, I think,
dynamite on cable.</i>


354
00:54:41.954 --> 00:54:43.956
<i>Make blast on ground,</i>

355
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:45.858
<i>instruments
smash through vibrations.</i>


356
00:54:51.831 --> 00:54:56.102
<i>I camped out mostly in
what I call the diagonal gulch,</i>


357
00:54:56.135 --> 00:55:00.472
<i>hoping to shoot up a helicopter
in an area east of Crater Mount.</i>


358
00:55:05.477 --> 00:55:07.579
<i>It proved harder than I thought.</i>

359
00:55:07.612 --> 00:55:09.782
<i>Those helicopters
always in motion,</i>


360
00:55:09.815 --> 00:55:12.084
<i>never know
where they would go next.</i>


361
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:26.866
Cocksuckers!

362
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:53.726
Fuck.

363
00:55:56.929 --> 00:55:58.864
<i>Desecration.</i>

364
00:55:58.898 --> 00:56:01.767
<i>Where can I go now
for peace and quiet?</i>


365
00:56:07.707 --> 00:56:10.042
<i>When I got
back to camp, I cried.</i>


366
00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:12.144
<i>Partly from
frustration of missing,</i>


367
00:56:12.178 --> 00:56:14.814
<i>but mostly grief about what
was happening to the country.</i>


368
00:56:14.847 --> 00:56:16.682
Fuck!

369
00:56:16.716 --> 00:56:18.583
Fuck you!

370
00:56:18.616 --> 00:56:21.053
<i>It is so beautiful.</i>

371
00:56:21.087 --> 00:56:24.991
<i>But if they did find oil...
disaster.</i>


372
00:56:25.024 --> 00:56:28.828
<i>Even if not find oil, the blast
and helicopters ruin it.</i>


373
00:57:26.018 --> 00:57:28.054
Ted Kaczynksi
reporting for duty.


374
00:57:28.087 --> 00:57:29.789
Hey, there, Ted.

375
00:57:29.822 --> 00:57:32.058
- Hello, Mrs. Hill.
- I'm so glad you're here.


376
00:57:32.091 --> 00:57:34.093
- You ready to work?
- Yes. What can I do?


377
00:57:34.126 --> 00:57:35.795
Let's head back this way.

378
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:40.232
I'm gonna put you
in the back with Becky,


379
00:57:40.266 --> 00:57:42.635
and we have
this huge pile of books


380
00:57:42.668 --> 00:57:44.236
that we have to sort through.

381
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:47.139
Unfortunately, we have
to get rid of all of them.


382
00:57:47.173 --> 00:57:51.143
So I'm gonna have you guys
split them up by genre and...


383
00:58:28.714 --> 00:58:30.349
- Hi.
- Hi.


384
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:32.184
I'm Becky.

385
00:58:32.218 --> 00:58:35.688
I'm... I'm Ted Kaczynksi.

386
00:58:44.964 --> 00:58:48.400
They should really move
from the Dewey Decimal System


387
00:58:48.434 --> 00:58:51.904
to the Library
of Congress system.


388
00:58:52.838 --> 00:58:56.909
I'd suggested it a while back,
but they still haven't, so,


389
00:58:56.942 --> 00:58:59.678
now we have
to do all this again.


390
00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:13.259
Um...

391
00:59:26.839 --> 00:59:28.107
No, we're...

392
01:00:03.142 --> 01:00:04.843
Fuck.

393
01:00:15.454 --> 01:00:18.157
Ugh. Goddamn it.

394
01:00:36.442 --> 01:00:38.477
Hi, David, it's me. Yeah.

395
01:00:41.213 --> 01:00:43.082
Yeah, because I was...

396
01:00:43.115 --> 01:00:46.919
I was calling to talk to you
and she picked up. And I...


397
01:00:46.952 --> 01:00:49.388
Well, I thought... I...

398
01:00:49.421 --> 01:00:50.990
I wanted to speak
to you, not her.


399
01:00:51.023 --> 01:00:52.491
I've never met her.
I thought it was


400
01:00:52.524 --> 01:00:54.493
a bad time to try
to meet her over the phone.


401
01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:56.528
And so I... so I hung up.

402
01:00:56.562 --> 01:00:59.798
Well, can I be trusted to say

403
01:00:59.832 --> 01:01:01.533
the right thing to...
to a woman, David?


404
01:01:01.567 --> 01:01:04.837
Especially Linda,
with the history, and...


405
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.872
Oh my God, is that her
in the background?


406
01:01:06.905 --> 01:01:08.140
David, fuck.

407
01:01:12.011 --> 01:01:15.314
Just tell her I apologize
and ask her to leave the room


408
01:01:15.347 --> 01:01:17.316
so I can talk to you
in private, please.


409
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:19.251
You domesticated yourself.

410
01:01:19.285 --> 01:01:21.854
You're like, like,
like a horse that's run


411
01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:24.456
into a farmer's field and...

412
01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:26.392
and volunteered for somebody
to jump on your back


413
01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:28.527
and put a bit in your mouth.

414
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.997
Well, I thought that
we shared a lot of values


415
01:01:32.031 --> 01:01:33.966
and I thought that we were on

416
01:01:33.999 --> 01:01:36.001
the same page of
living in the wild.


417
01:01:36.035 --> 01:01:39.938
Now you're living in a zoo like
a caged animal with a trainer.


418
01:01:39.972 --> 01:01:42.574
A trainer who, uh,

419
01:01:42.608 --> 01:01:46.211
who you need
to run everything by. Um...


420
01:01:47.379 --> 01:01:49.315
I'm sure...
oh, I bet you have too.


421
01:01:49.348 --> 01:01:51.016
Like if I...
if I asked you... I was...


422
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:52.384
I was actually gonna call to ask

423
01:01:52.418 --> 01:01:54.553
for some help,
some financial help.


424
01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:56.322
I just wanted
a little money that I could...


425
01:01:56.355 --> 01:01:59.024
that I could repay.
But I'm sure you have...


426
01:01:59.058 --> 01:02:00.592
Yeah, you would have...

427
01:02:00.627 --> 01:02:02.629
Yes, you would have to ask her,
wouldn't you?


428
01:02:02.662 --> 01:02:04.463
Mm-hmm.

429
01:02:04.496 --> 01:02:06.432
See, that's what I mean.

430
01:05:17.222 --> 01:05:18.490
Hey!

431
01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:42.080
Get off my land!

432
01:05:42.114 --> 01:05:43.615
Get off my property.

433
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:39.571
Ted!

434
01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.541
Man in the cabin.

435
01:06:43.676 --> 01:06:45.110
Ted.

436
01:07:03.528 --> 01:07:07.132
- Good morning.
- Morning. Nice day.


437
01:07:07.967 --> 01:07:09.534
Yeah.

438
01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.336
You know, just checking
through the pass


439
01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:12.939
and a little investigation

440
01:07:12.972 --> 01:07:14.907
I was hoping
you could help me with.


441
01:07:14.941 --> 01:07:16.843
You seen anyone, anything,

442
01:07:16.876 --> 01:07:19.578
people, fooling around
with any buildings around here?


443
01:07:19.611 --> 01:07:21.848
No, only those, uh...

444
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:24.884
kids who vandalized
that cabin a while back.


445
01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:26.385
Nothing since then.

446
01:07:26.753 --> 01:07:28.888
- Sure,
- You talk to Steve or Tom?


447
01:07:28.921 --> 01:07:31.791
Yeah, Steve said his mill
got wrecked a while back too.


448
01:07:31.824 --> 01:07:34.393
Yeah, a while ago. Yeah.

449
01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:37.462
Or, um, motorcyclers,
they hassling you nearby here?


450
01:07:37.496 --> 01:07:40.265
No, nothing like
snowmobile season, anyway, huh?


451
01:07:40.298 --> 01:07:42.735
Exactly. Right, um...

452
01:07:42.769 --> 01:07:44.737
The reason I had to ask
was we heard you got


453
01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:47.272
pretty upset with some riders
from up the creek.


454
01:07:47.305 --> 01:07:49.608
Yeah, I did. I did, yeah.

455
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:53.813
Yes, assholes, though.
A couple of punks tried to...


456
01:07:53.846 --> 01:07:58.350
tried to come across my...
my property and, um...


457
01:07:58.383 --> 01:07:59.618
Yeah.

458
01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.723
I wouldn't call it anything
out of the ordinary, though,


459
01:08:03.756 --> 01:08:07.727
I imagine if you were
in my position, you would...


460
01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:11.764
You might act the same way.

461
01:08:16.636 --> 01:08:19.438
Sure. Yeah, that's fair.

462
01:08:19.471 --> 01:08:21.406
I appreciate your time.
If you, uh, hear of anything


463
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.842
you let me know.

464
01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:24.309
Mm-hm.

465
01:08:53.438 --> 01:08:55.675
- Have a nice day.
- See you, Ted.


466
01:09:18.563 --> 01:09:21.333
<i>I don't want to

01:23:44.429 --> 01:23:46.365
<i>also in the late '70s.</i>

620
01:23:46.398 --> 01:23:48.868
<i>There have
been college professors.</i>


621
01:23:48.901 --> 01:23:52.471
<i>Two types of bombs
in the sense that bout half</i>


622
01:23:52.504 --> 01:23:56.575
<i>of them are mailed,
letter bombs or package bombs.</i>


623
01:23:56.608 --> 01:23:58.745
<i>And about half of them
have been placed</i>


624
01:23:58.778 --> 01:24:01.748
<i>in a position
where someone would, uh,</i>


625
01:24:01.781 --> 01:24:04.383
<i>disturb the package.</i>

626
01:24:11.256 --> 01:24:14.727
<i>Well, as long as I'm going
to throw everything away anyway,</i>


627
01:24:14.761 --> 01:24:18.430
<i>instead of having to shoot it
out with the cops or something,</i>


628
01:24:18.463 --> 01:24:21.500
<i>I will go up to Canada,
and take off into the woods</i>


629
01:24:21.533 --> 01:24:24.369
<i>with a rifle
and try to live off the country.</i>


630
01:24:24.403 --> 01:24:25.838
<i>If that doesn't work out</i>

631
01:24:25.872 --> 01:24:27.807
<i>and if I can
get back to civilization</i>


632
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.308
<i>before I starve,
then I will come back here</i>


633
01:24:30.342 --> 01:24:32.912
<i>and kill someone I hate.</i>

634
01:24:37.784 --> 01:24:40.519
I need to renew my passport.

635
01:24:41.453 --> 01:24:42.822
And...

636
01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:32.404
<i>Clearly, we are in a position</i>

637
01:25:32.437 --> 01:25:34.439
<i>to do a great deal of damage.</i>

638
01:25:34.473 --> 01:25:35.908
<i>And it doesn't appear
that the FBI</i>


639
01:25:35.942 --> 01:25:38.343
<i>is gonna catch
us anytime soon.</i>


640
01:25:40.378 --> 01:25:42.982
<i>The FBI is a joke.</i>

641
01:25:58.396 --> 01:26:02.334
<i>FBI, suck my cock.</i>

642
01:26:43.575 --> 01:26:45.745
- Morning.
- Uh, morning.


643
01:26:46.779 --> 01:26:51.083
I have a complaint about
the Montana Telephone Company.


644
01:26:51.117 --> 01:26:55.054
It concerns, uh, some of your
payphones in Lincoln, Montana.


645
01:26:55.087 --> 01:26:58.858
These pay phones consistently
malfunction in such a manner


646
01:26:58.891 --> 01:27:01.761
as to steal a caller's quarters.

647
01:27:01.794 --> 01:27:04.030
You put a quarter in and then
it either gets jammed


648
01:27:04.063 --> 01:27:05.932
or it doesn't register.

649
01:27:05.965 --> 01:27:07.599
And then the coin release
doesn't work


650
01:27:07.633 --> 01:27:09.534
so that either you can't
put the call through


651
01:27:09.568 --> 01:27:12.038
and the quarters are lost,
or the call does go through,


652
01:27:12.071 --> 01:27:14.539
but you end up paying 25 cents
or 50 cents more


653
01:27:14.573 --> 01:27:15.808
than the price of the call.

654
01:27:16.742 --> 01:27:19.377
This problem has persisted
for several years.


655
01:27:22.514 --> 01:27:24.817
This is not the first time
that I have, uh...


656
01:27:24.851 --> 01:27:27.119
that I have complained,
although it is the first time


657
01:27:27.153 --> 01:27:28.788
that I've complained in person,

658
01:27:28.821 --> 01:27:30.656
but I've spoken to
the operators about it


659
01:27:30.690 --> 01:27:32.892
several times and nothing
has been done over the years.


660
01:27:33.726 --> 01:27:36.162
The main offender
is actually the payphone


661
01:27:36.195 --> 01:27:38.764
on the corner of Highway 200
and Stemple Pass.


662
01:27:38.798 --> 01:27:40.900
I'm forced to use that one
on occasion because


663
01:27:40.933 --> 01:27:42.567
it's the only one
that the company provides


664
01:27:42.601 --> 01:27:45.171
that offers any level
of privacy at all.


665
01:27:45.204 --> 01:27:47.907
But it steals at least

666
01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.574
It swindles me.

667
01:27:49.608 --> 01:27:51.944
And the company is aware
of this offending booth.


668
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:54.546
That's a criminal act.

669
01:27:54.579 --> 01:27:56.148
My money is being stolen.

670
01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:00.485
On behalf
of the Montana phone company,


671
01:28:00.518 --> 01:28:03.656
I apologize
for your inconvenience.


672
01:28:03.689 --> 01:28:05.858
Uh, do you happen
to have a record


673
01:28:05.892 --> 01:28:07.693
of how much money
you've lost over the years?


674
01:28:07.727 --> 01:28:10.029
I do. $5.75.

675
01:28:10.062 --> 01:28:13.666
- $5.75?
- Yes. Yes, this year.


676
01:28:13.699 --> 01:28:14.934
- This year.
- Yes.


677
01:28:14.967 --> 01:28:16.736
Hmm.

678
01:28:16.769 --> 01:28:19.872
I have a letter
which, uh, you could give


679
01:28:19.906 --> 01:28:23.776
to your superiors,
and it contains all the details


680
01:28:23.809 --> 01:28:26.679
that I have
just relayed to you now.


681
01:28:26.712 --> 01:28:29.815
I would love to give
it to my superiors, but...


682
01:28:29.849 --> 01:28:33.052
we can only accept letters
through the post.


683
01:28:34.086 --> 01:28:35.988
I can't hand-deliver a letter.

684
01:28:36.989 --> 01:28:38.658
Do you see the problem?

685
01:28:45.264 --> 01:28:48.801
I came in here to bring
you the letter in person.


686
01:28:48.834 --> 01:28:50.069
I appreciate that.

687
01:28:51.603 --> 01:28:52.939
But I can't take it.

688
01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.962
You have a wonderful day.

689
01:29:15.995 --> 01:29:18.164
I'm gonna write to
my congressman about this.


690
01:29:18.197 --> 01:29:19.865
Okay.

691
01:30:16.288 --> 01:30:18.224
<i>During my romantic phase,</i>

692
01:30:18.257 --> 01:30:21.861
<i>I continued to have fantasies
of a primitive life,</i>


693
01:30:21.894 --> 01:30:23.929
<i>but I tended strongly
to embellish</i>


694
01:30:23.963 --> 01:30:28.667
<i>this with romantic details
like horns resounding through</i>


695
01:30:28.701 --> 01:30:31.837
<i>the forest, savage-looking
tunics and bearskin</i>


696
01:30:31.871 --> 01:30:33.105
<i>and so forth.</i>

697
01:31:24.757 --> 01:31:27.993
Sequence of small advances,
there will be no rational


698
01:31:28.027 --> 01:31:30.296
and effective public resistance.

699
01:31:30.329 --> 01:31:33.632
It is not possible to make
a lasting compromise


700
01:31:33.666 --> 01:31:35.901
between technology and freedom

701
01:31:35.935 --> 01:31:38.904
because technology is by far
the more powerful social force


702
01:31:38.938 --> 01:31:40.673
and continually...

703
01:31:40.706 --> 01:31:44.110
erodes on freedom
through repeated compromise.


704
01:32:02.261 --> 01:32:05.030
<i>As society
and the problems that face it</i>


705
01:32:05.064 --> 01:32:06.966
<i>become more and more complex,</i>

706
01:32:06.999 --> 01:32:10.002
<i>and as machines become
more and more intelligent,</i>


707
01:32:10.035 --> 01:32:12.872
<i>people will let machines
make more and more</i>


708
01:32:12.905 --> 01:32:14.840
<i>of their decisions for them,</i>

709
01:32:14.874 --> 01:32:17.042
<i>simply because
machine-made decisions</i>


710
01:32:17.076 --> 01:32:20.346
<i>will bring better results
than manmade ones.</i>


711
01:32:23.115 --> 01:32:25.151
<i>Eventually,
a stage may be reached</i>


712
01:32:25.184 --> 01:32:27.353
<i>at which the decisions
necessary to keep</i>


713
01:32:27.386 --> 01:32:30.022
<i>the system running will be
so complex that human beings</i>


714
01:32:30.055 --> 01:32:33.092
<i>will be incapable
of making them intelligently.</i>


715
01:32:33.125 --> 01:32:36.362
<i>At that stage, the machines
will be in effective control.</i>


716
01:32:36.395 --> 01:32:39.131
<i>People won't be able
to just turn the machines</i>


717
01:32:39.165 --> 01:32:41.167
<i>off because they will
be so dependent on them</i>


718
01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.702
<i>that turning them
off would amount to suicide.</i>


719
01:33:19.104 --> 01:33:22.341
I must have been going

720
01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:06.919
You know, my parents...

721
01:34:06.952 --> 01:34:10.889
pushed me so hard in academia,
I never really learned


722
01:34:10.923 --> 01:34:13.292
to be at ease around women.

723
01:34:13.325 --> 01:34:15.194
Can you tell me your heart, Ted?

724
01:34:16.362 --> 01:34:18.030
You're quite right.

725
01:34:18.063 --> 01:34:19.298
You love me.

726
01:34:19.932 --> 01:34:21.166
I do.

727
01:34:22.201 --> 01:34:24.970
I do. See, actually, uh...

728
01:34:25.004 --> 01:34:26.905
It's the truth. I love you.

729
01:34:26.939 --> 01:34:29.275
I love you so much I'm gonna
let go of these handlebars.


730
01:34:29.308 --> 01:34:31.410
- No, don't do it!
- I'm gonna let go!


731
01:34:31.443 --> 01:34:33.245
- No, please don't.
- Okay, one hand.


732
01:34:33.279 --> 01:34:34.913
Just one hand, okay?

733
01:34:34.947 --> 01:34:36.915
Come on, there you go,
there you go!


734
01:34:37.616 --> 01:34:39.818
- Put it down!
- Okay, okay.


735
01:34:39.852 --> 01:34:42.021
Oh, the right hand come off!
You're my right hand.


736
01:34:42.054 --> 01:34:44.256
You might have to be
the right hand of a man.


737
01:34:44.290 --> 01:34:46.225
Okay, okay.

738
01:35:16.322 --> 01:35:20.292
<i>We are an anarchist group...</i>

739
01:35:20.326 --> 01:35:24.930
...calling ourselves...

740
01:35:24.963 --> 01:35:27.533
- <i>Calling ourselves FC.</i>
- ...FC.


741
01:35:27.566 --> 01:35:31.170
<i>Notice that the postmark
on this envelope</i>


742
01:35:31.203 --> 01:35:33.138
<i>precedes a newsworthy event</i>

743
01:35:33.172 --> 01:35:36.942
<i>that will happen about the time
you receive this letter,</i>


744
01:35:36.975 --> 01:35:39.044
<i>if nothing goes wrong.</i>

745
01:35:39.078 --> 01:35:44.483
We are getting tired

746
01:35:44.516 --> 01:35:49.121
of making bombs.

747
01:35:51.658 --> 01:35:55.227
<i>It's no fun having to spend
all your evenings and weekends</i>


748
01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:57.162
<i>preparing dangerous mixtures,</i>

749
01:35:57.196 --> 01:35:59.998
<i>filing trigger mechanisms
out of scraps of metal</i>


750
01:36:00.032 --> 01:36:01.900
<i>or searching the Sierras
for a place</i>


751
01:36:01.934 --> 01:36:03.969
<i>isolated enough
to test the bomb.</i>


752
01:36:06.205 --> 01:36:08.173
<i>So we offer a bargain.</i>

753
01:36:09.208 --> 01:36:12.177
<i>We have a long article
between 29,000</i>


754
01:36:12.211 --> 01:36:15.581
<i>and 37,000 words
that we want to have published.</i>


755
01:36:15.614 --> 01:36:19.385
<i>If you can get it published
according to our requirements,</i>


756
01:36:19.418 --> 01:36:23.188
<i>we will permanently desist
from terrorist activities.</i>


757
01:36:23.222 --> 01:36:25.257
<i>If the answer is satisfactory,</i>

758
01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:27.660
<i>we will finish typing
the manuscript and send</i>


759
01:36:27.694 --> 01:36:30.362
<i>it to you. If the answer
is unsatisfactory,</i>


760
01:36:30.396 --> 01:36:32.398
<i>we will start building
our next bomb.</i>


761
01:36:37.002 --> 01:36:38.237
<i>FC.</i>

762
01:37:42.468 --> 01:37:45.404
I am choked with frustration
at my inability to get


763
01:37:45.437 --> 01:37:48.574
my stinking fucking family
off my back once and for all.


764
01:37:49.341 --> 01:37:51.143
No, it does include you, David.

765
01:37:51.176 --> 01:37:52.478
It emphatically
and specifically


766
01:37:52.511 --> 01:37:54.446
includes you, yeah.

767
01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.249
Of course, you... you're part
of my stinking fucking family.


768
01:37:57.282 --> 01:37:59.618
It's not an emotional decision.
It's a logical decision, David.


769
01:37:59.652 --> 01:38:02.254
It's logical.
Yeah, I have my own life.


770
01:38:02.287 --> 01:38:04.523
I have my own life, David,
I think my own thoughts


771
01:38:04.556 --> 01:38:06.626
and then I do what
I think I should do,

<i>a news conference
from San Francisco</i>


785

<i>headed up by the FBI today
concerning the bomb threat</i>


786
01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.302
<i>that has come in.
The person behind the threat</i>


787
01:39:23.335 --> 01:39:25.537
<i>may be the so-called Unabomber,</i>

788
01:39:25.571 --> 01:39:28.173
<i>and the threat has resulted
in heightened security</i>


789
01:39:28.206 --> 01:39:30.576
<i>at five airports in...</i>

790
01:39:30.609 --> 01:39:33.846
<i>Small debris,
big debris, dust...</i>


791
01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:36.582
<i>I'm relieved to
see a lot of security around...</i>


792
01:39:36.615 --> 01:39:38.651
<i>...and determination?</i>

793
01:39:38.685 --> 01:39:41.153
<i>Well, our position is we will
keep the security measures</i>


794
01:39:41.186 --> 01:39:43.756
<i>in place until
the matter is resolved.</i>


795
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:45.591
<i>It's been more
than five days since</i>


796
01:39:45.625 --> 01:39:48.160
<i>the Unabomber threatened
to blow up an airliner</i>


797
01:39:48.193 --> 01:39:51.530
<i>flying in or out
of Los Angeles by July 4th.</i>


798
01:39:51.563 --> 01:39:55.467
<i>But after 17 years,

799
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.437
<i>a Unabomber
is nothing to joke about.</i>


800
01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:01.406
<i>Experts say the Unabomber
is stepping up his activities</i>


801
01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:03.342
<i>because he's jealous
of the attention given</i>


802
01:40:03.375 --> 01:40:05.344
<i>to the Oklahoma City bombing</i>

803
01:40:05.377 --> 01:40:06.846
<i>which stole the thunder</i>

804
01:40:06.879 --> 01:40:08.547
<i>from his last
package bomb explosion.</i>


805
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:10.683
<i>Experts also believe
the Unabomber</i>


806
01:40:10.717 --> 01:40:12.685
<i>may be headed for a fall.</i>

807
01:40:12.719 --> 01:40:14.854
<i>I think he's on a high now.</i>

808
01:40:14.887 --> 01:40:17.155
<i>I think he's all pumped up.</i>

809
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:19.558
<i>I think he's intoxicated
with his own power,</i>


810
01:40:19.591 --> 01:40:22.461
<i>and I think at this point,
he's most vulnerable.</i>


811
01:40:24.496 --> 01:40:26.633
<i>I think he might
have made some major mistakes.</i>


812
01:41:02.635 --> 01:41:04.704
<i>The FBI is unable to catch him,</i>

813
01:41:04.737 --> 01:41:07.205
<i>and now the Unabomber
has raised the stakes again.</i>


814
01:41:07.239 --> 01:41:09.441
<i>In the letter sent
to The Washington Post</i>


815
01:41:09.474 --> 01:41:11.610
<i>and the New York Times this
week, the Unabomber has pledged</i>


816
01:41:11.644 --> 01:41:13.746
<i>to stop his murderous spree
if these leading American papers</i>


817
01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:16.214
<i>will publish
a 35,000 word manifesto.</i>


818
01:41:16.248 --> 01:41:19.217
<i>In the document the Unabomber
condemns modern technology</i>


819
01:41:19.251 --> 01:41:21.286
<i>and says computers have
created a world in which humans</i>


820
01:41:21.319 --> 01:41:24.322
<i>are mere cogs in the machine.
That proposal has led to a life</i>


821
01:41:24.356 --> 01:41:26.759
<i>or death question
for The Post and Times:</i>


822
01:41:26.793 --> 01:41:29.227
<i>should they cave in to threats
and publish, or refuse</i>


823
01:41:29.261 --> 01:41:30.963
<i>to let themselves be
used as a platform...</i>


824
01:41:30.997 --> 01:41:34.734
In paragraph 125,
we use an analogy of a weak


825
01:41:34.767 --> 01:41:38.403
neighbor who was left destitute
by a strong neighbor who takes


826
01:41:38.437 --> 01:41:41.974
all his land by forcing on
him a series of compromises.


827
01:41:42.008 --> 01:41:45.712
But suppose now that
the strong neighbor gets sick


828
01:41:45.745 --> 01:41:48.280
so that he is unable
to defend himself.


829
01:41:48.313 --> 01:41:50.950
The weak neighbor
can force the strong one


830
01:41:50.983 --> 01:41:53.720
to give him his land back
or he can kill him.


831
01:41:53.753 --> 01:41:56.856
If he lets the strong man
survive and only forces him


832
01:41:56.889 --> 01:41:59.291
to give his land back,
he is a fool,


833
01:41:59.324 --> 01:42:02.260
because when the strong man gets
well, he will again take all


834
01:42:02.294 --> 01:42:04.262
the land for himself.

835
01:42:04.296 --> 01:42:06.531
The only sensible alternative
for the weaker man is to kill


836
01:42:06.565 --> 01:42:09.736
a strong one while he has
the chance. In the same way,


837
01:42:09.769 --> 01:42:11.704
While the industrial
system is sick,


838
01:42:11.738 --> 01:42:14.907
we must destroy it.
If we compromise with it


839
01:42:14.941 --> 01:42:16.709
and let it recover
from its sickness,


840
01:42:16.743 --> 01:42:18.644
it will eventually wipe
out all of our freedom.

848

got a little bit confused about
where your property line ends.


921
01:56:18.216 --> 01:56:20.787
And we were hoping
that you could show us


922
01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:23.221
exactly where this line is.

923
01:56:26.726 --> 01:56:28.861
Yeah. Yeah, no. All right,

924
01:56:28.895 --> 01:56:31.229
let me just get my jacket...

925
01:56:31.263 --> 01:56:32.765
Get your fucking hands off me!

926
01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:36.168
Get your fucking
hands off of me!


927
01:56:36.201 --> 01:56:38.570
Get your fucking
hands off of me!


928
01:56:39.338 --> 01:56:42.842
Mr. Kaczynski, we are the FBI.

929
01:56:42.875 --> 01:56:45.845
We have a warrant
to search your cabin.


930
01:56:50.415 --> 01:56:52.551
Okay. Okay.

931
01:56:52.584 --> 01:56:54.286
Yeah.

932
01:57:03.528 --> 01:57:04.797
Got him!

933
01:58:10.029 --> 01:58:11.931
<i>... we're told
by federal law enforcement</i>


934
01:58:11.964 --> 01:58:15.600
<i>officials is that they received
a tip on this person indirectly</i>


935
01:58:15.635 --> 01:58:17.670
<i>from a family member.</i>

936
01:58:17.704 --> 01:58:20.539
<i>This man's brother contacted
a prominent Washington D.C.</i>


937
01:58:20.572 --> 01:58:23.608
<i>Lawyer, who in turn
got in touch with the FBI</i>


938
01:58:23.643 --> 01:58:25.678
<i>and told them about this person,
and they've had him under</i>


939
01:58:25.712 --> 01:58:28.447
<i>surveillance now for about
a week or so, we're told.</i>


940
01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.283
<i>They are preparing right now
to serve a search warrant,</i>


941
01:58:31.316 --> 01:58:33.753
<i>or probably in the process
of serving it now.</i>


942
01:58:33.786 --> 01:58:36.388
<i>We don't know whether this
person is at home,</i>


943
01:58:36.421 --> 01:58:38.356
<i>or what they expect
to find there.</i>


944
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:40.026
<i>If they're just going to
find evidence that they would</i>


945
01:58:40.059 --> 01:58:41.961
<i>take from the house,
possible evidence,</i>


946
01:58:41.994 --> 01:58:43.963
<i>or whether they're actually
going to find something.</i>


947
01:58:43.996 --> 01:58:45.832
<i>We don't know whether there's
been any arrest yet...</i>


948
01:59:58.465 --> 02:00:03.465
