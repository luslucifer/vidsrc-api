5
00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:20.186
Here you go.
Thank you.


6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.653
Oh, that was wonderful.

7
00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:24.553
What a beautiful day
for a ride.


8
00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:26.186
Our last ride.

9
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.920
At least we got to fit one in
before I go.


10
00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:31.186
But I don't want you to go.

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.620
It's only for the summer.

12
00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:34.620
That's a long time, Mom.

13
00:00:34.754 --> 00:00:36.153
Erin...

14
00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:38.854
...you know your dad

15
00:00:38.987 --> 00:00:40.887
doesn't want you
to call me that anymore.


16
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.387
I don't care what Dad says.

17
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.987
You're my Mom,
and you always will be.


18
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.620
But your dad and I
are divorced now and...


19
00:00:46.754 --> 00:00:48.020
he's seeing someone new.

20
00:00:48.153 --> 00:00:49.153
Yeah. Bethany.

21
00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:50.220
I hate her.

22
00:00:50.353 --> 00:00:51.854
That's because
you don't know her.


23
00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:53.286
Which is why
your dad and I thought


24
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.687
that my summer vacation
was the perfect opportunity


25
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.620
for you and Bethany
to spend time together,


26
00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:02.153
without me around
as a distraction.


27
00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:03.887
But why do you
have to go so far?


28
00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:09.253
Because Parable
is a magical place.


29
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.420
I was your age
the last time I there.


30
00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:14.253
But what if it's, like,
totally changed


31
00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:15.920
and it's really horrible now?

32
00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:17.954
Well, I guess I'll find out.

33
00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:19.286
Can I come visit?

34
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.653
That's up to your father.

35
00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:26.186
But we'll stay in touch.

36
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.653
Okay? Constantly.

37
00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:33.286
I'm gonna miss you so much.

38
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.487
Me too, sweetheart.

39
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.620
Me too. Come here.

Ma'am?

51
00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:47.487
I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.


52
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.687
Do what?

53
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.320
Well, leave your purse there
and turn your back on it.


54
00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:52.286
You're practically
begging someone to take it.


55
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.520
In Parable?

56
00:02:53.653 --> 00:02:55.653
Even Parable
isn't immune to crime.


57
00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:00.854
Well, I guess you would know.

58
00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:01.887
Thanks for the tip.

59
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.120
Have a nice day, ma'am.

60
00:03:03.253 --> 00:03:04.353
You too.

61
00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:26.387
Hi!

62
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.787
Hi.

63
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.887
Ms. Kendall?

64
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.220
Tara. Please.

65
00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:31.954
Joanna Barlow.
Nice to meet you.


66
00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.320
Welcome to Parable.

67
00:03:33.453 --> 00:03:34.587
Thank you.

68
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.020
So, how are we doing in
the first-impression department?


69
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.120
So far, so good.

70
00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.920
Come on, let me
give you the grand tour.


71
00:03:43.053 --> 00:03:44.653
Can I help you with your bags?

72
00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:45.887
Oh, no, no. I'll get--
I'll get them later.


73
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.920
Okay.

74
00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:50.020
Watch your step here.

75
00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:56.487
Well, this is it.

76
00:03:58.053 --> 00:03:59.787
Dad's a stickler
for authentic--


77
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.787
read, "fusty and musty."

78
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.854
Mom wanted
to modernize the place.


79
00:04:03.987 --> 00:04:05.487
He grumbled a bit,

80
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.887
but secretly,
I know he likes it.


81
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.286
I bet.

82
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.820
They retired to Florida
a couple of years ago


83
00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:12.787
and transferred the title
to me and my husband,


84
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.253
but we have
a bigger working ranch,


85
00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:15.453
and we're happy there.

86
00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:17.820
We should probably
sell this place,


87
00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:19.954
but, you know,
sentimental value.


88
00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:22.487
Wow. What a beautiful view.

89
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.320
Mm. Is that what
brought you here? The view?


90
00:04:25.453 --> 00:04:27.553
Because if you Google
"off the beaten track,"


91
00:04:27.687 --> 00:04:29.286
there's bound to be
a picture of Parable.


92
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.854
I came here for a few weeks
as a girl.


93
00:04:31.987 --> 00:04:33.353
Summer camp
at the dude ranch.


94
00:04:33.487 --> 00:04:34.320
Whisper Creek?

95
00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:35.720
Yeah! Yeah.
I looked it up online.


96
00:04:35.854 --> 00:04:37.186
I know
it's no longer in operation.


97
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.520
No, not anymore.

98
00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:39.653
That's too bad.

99
00:04:39.787 --> 00:04:42.320
Some of the happiest days
of my life.


100
00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:44.420
And I could really use
some happy right now.


101
00:04:44.553 --> 00:04:46.153
You know, bad divorce.

102
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.620
- Ah.
- Yeah.


103
00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.020
- I got it.
-


104
00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:51.020
What is that sound?

105
00:04:51.153 --> 00:04:52.754
Oh, let me show you.

106
00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:54.353
Bawk!

107
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.020
They're overflow
from the ranch.


108
00:04:58.153 --> 00:04:59.320
We've been roosting them here.

109
00:04:59.453 --> 00:05:01.720
I'll come by tomorrow
to collect them.


110
00:05:01.854 --> 00:05:03.220
How fun.

111
00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:05.086
Chickens? Fun?

112
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.353
Yeah! Leave 'em here!
I'll take care of them.


113
00:05:07.487 --> 00:05:09.687
Uh, chickens are a lot of work.

114
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.854
I'm not afraid of work.

115
00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:13.720
Okay, if you want.

116
00:05:13.854 --> 00:05:16.253
I'll have my son, Dawson,
come by to get you up to speed.


117
00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:17.353
He's an expert.

118
00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:19.587
Okay. Great.

119
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.320
All right.
Good to see ya.


120
00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:25.186
Hey. Don't tell me
you brought me lunch.


121
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.987
I won't,
'cause I didn't.


122
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.353
To what do I owe the pleasure?

123
00:05:29.487 --> 00:05:31.120
I just thought
I'd stop by and say hi.


124
00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:33.653
Uh-huh.

125
00:05:33.787 --> 00:05:36.286
Okay. You got me.

126
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.086
It was all Kendra's idea.

127
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.887
That sounds like it. Yep.

128
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.520
You remember her cousin, Julie,
from Billings?


129
00:05:43.653 --> 00:05:45.820
Yeah. Sure.
Got married last summer, right?


130
00:05:47.587 --> 00:05:50.220
Uh, she called that off, actually.

131
00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:52.186
Oh. Well...

132
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.086
I'm sorry to hear that.

133
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.153
Anyway, she's gonna be
visiting this weekend.


134
00:05:56.286 --> 00:05:59.053
I thought you might want
to come over for a barbecue.


135
00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:00.787
You're not trying
to set me up, are ya?


136
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.820
Absolutely.

137
00:06:01.954 --> 00:06:03.754
I really wish
you wouldn't do that.


138
00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:06.253
You told me you were ready
to start dating again.


139
00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:07.520
No, that's not what I said.

140
00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:10.387
I said I'm ready to start thinking
about dating again.


141
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.754
There's a big difference!

142
00:06:11.887 --> 00:06:12.787
Julie's a fun girl.

143
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.120
Yeah, I'm sure
she's a fun girl.


144
00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:15.320
She's also young.

145
00:06:15.453 --> 00:06:17.020
She's never been a mom.

146
00:06:17.153 --> 00:06:18.253
I got the boys.

147
00:06:18.387 --> 00:06:21.153
And the evidence would suggest
that she's marriage-shy.


148
00:06:21.286 --> 00:06:23.587
Boone, I'm not talking
about marriage.


149
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.053
I'm talking about a barbecue.

150
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.620
Look, Hutch.

151
00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.820
I appreciate it,
I really do,


152
00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:30.920
but if I'm gonna
walk through that door,


153
00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:32.253
it's gotta feel right
going in.


154
00:06:32.387 --> 00:06:33.687
That's all there is to it.

155
00:06:34.954 --> 00:06:38.887
What you had with Corrie
was really special.


156
00:06:40.553 --> 00:06:42.920
You make a lousy good ol' boy,
you know that?


157
00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:44.253
Look who's talking!

158
00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:45.754
Ah...

159
00:06:45.887 --> 00:06:46.820
love ya anyway.

160
00:06:46.954 --> 00:06:48.420
Take care.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.587
Bingo.

165
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.653
You are a genius, Tara Kendall.

166
00:07:17.153 --> 00:07:18.687
-
- Oh! Ow!


167
00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:23.120
Or not.

168
00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.453
Oh, that's a winner.

169
00:07:44.387 --> 00:07:45.487
All right, boys.

170
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.186
Time for dinner.

171
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.653
Okay? Let's go. Come on.

172
00:07:48.787 --> 00:07:51.587
That's good.
Squeezing the gloves, right?


173
00:07:52.653 --> 00:07:54.720
So what'd you guys
get up to at day camp today?


174
00:07:54.854 --> 00:07:55.920
Played baseball.

175
00:07:56.053 --> 00:07:57.387
With girls. Boring.

176
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.153
Girls? What have you got
against girls?


177
00:07:59.286 --> 00:08:00.754
There's only like
a dozen campers, Fletcher.


178
00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:02.020
If they don't team us up
with the girls,


179
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.487
we can't play baseball
or anything.


180
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.754
We don't need to play baseball.

181
00:08:04.887 --> 00:08:05.887
What?

182
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.120
Who are you and what
have you done with my son?


183
00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:09.420
My kid loves baseball.

184
00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:10.920
Nicole tagged him out
at home today.


185
00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:11.987
Ahh.

186
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.053
I was safe!

187
00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:14.720
Her mitt never touched me.

188
00:08:14.854 --> 00:08:17.553
And if it had,
it would've been icky!


189
00:08:17.687 --> 00:08:20.253
"Icky"? Let me
tell you something, young man.


190
00:08:20.387 --> 00:08:21.420
One of these days,

191
00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:23.420
you are going to like girls.

192
00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:24.754
No, I won't.

193
00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:26.387
- Mom was a girl, you know.
- Uh-huh.


194
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.186
No, she wasn't.
She was... a mom.


195
00:08:30.754 --> 00:08:31.987
Mm.

196
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.286
You know what I miss about Mom?

197
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.353
- What's that, bud?
- Her spaghetti sauce.


198
00:08:36.754 --> 00:08:37.787
What?

199
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.987
Are you saying
you don't like my sauce?


200
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.553
Mom's was better.

201
00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.020
It's the same recipe!

202
00:08:43.153 --> 00:08:44.053
It doesn't taste the same.

203
00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:46.754
Well, how's it supposed
to taste?


204
00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:48.854
I don't know,
more like Mom's.


205
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.220
May I be excused?

206
00:08:52.153 --> 00:08:54.520
Yeah. Yeah, sure, Fletch.
Go ahead.


207
00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:04.053
Any idea what's eating
your little brother?


208
00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.420
Oh, you know.

209
00:09:06.553 --> 00:09:07.520
Right.

210
00:09:08.587 --> 00:09:10.920
He doesn't like it
when we talk about Mom.


211
00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:16.020
I mean, it's sad
that she's gone and all,


212
00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:17.587
but, like...

213
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.420
we should be able
to talk about her still.


214
00:09:19.553 --> 00:09:21.320
Yeah, I agree. Absolutely.

215
00:09:21.453 --> 00:09:23.954
We should be able
to talk about her.


216
00:09:24.086 --> 00:09:25.787
But here's the thing, Griff.

217
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.987
Ahem. You're the older brother.

218
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.320
Fletch is always gonna be
playing catch-up,


219
00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.487
so I think we just have to...

220
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.020
we have to be patient with him,
that's all.


221
00:09:36.153 --> 00:09:37.653
Okay. I will.

222
00:09:37.787 --> 00:09:38.787
I'm gonna go check
on your brother.


223
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.286
You finish up and then
clear the table, okay?


224
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.353
- Okay.
- Thattaboy.


225
00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:44.754
Oh, yeah, and this time--

226
00:09:44.887 --> 00:09:45.720
when you do the dishes,

227
00:09:45.854 --> 00:09:48.920
put the dishes
in the dishwasher.


228
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.186
...Spinach, cabbage,
uh, ground-up eggshells.


229
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.186
Eggshells?

230
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.353
Isn't that
a little cannibalistic?


231
00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:07.653
Not for the chickens,
I guess.


232
00:10:07.787 --> 00:10:09.186
Uh, we'll be mixing up
a special batch for them


233
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.186
later in the week--

234
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.620
I could bring you some.

235
00:10:11.754 --> 00:10:14.320
Yeah, that would be great, thanks.

236
00:10:14.453 --> 00:10:18.987
So, um, are we raising them
to be eaten?


237
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.286
We usually just keep 'em
for the eggs.


238
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.153
Oh, okay,
well, I will too, then.


239
00:10:23.286 --> 00:10:24.387
They're gonna lay a lot of 'em.

240
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.020
The local supply store will
buy the extras off of you.


241
00:10:27.153 --> 00:10:28.120
While you're there,

242
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.954
I'd get yourself
a good pair of gloves,


243
00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:31.687
'cause, this breed...

244
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.687
they like to bite.

245
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.920
Oh. Good to know.

246
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.520
You look like
you could use some help.


247
00:10:58.754 --> 00:10:59.954
Thanks. I
-I could.

248
00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:03.053
Um, I am looking
for a pair of work gloves,


249
00:11:03.186 --> 00:11:05.854
and I don't know
what kind to--


250
00:11:06.887 --> 00:11:09.520
I'm sorry. Are you--
Are you Casey Elfman?


251
00:11:09.653 --> 00:11:11.520
My clever disguise
fails again.


252
00:11:11.653 --> 00:11:15.086
I'm sure you hear this a lot,
but I am a huge fan.


253
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.920
Well, I can
never hear it enough.


254
00:11:17.053 --> 00:11:19.220
Now, what are you gonna be
doing in these work gloves?


255
00:11:19.353 --> 00:11:21.387
Warding off chicken bites.

256
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.220
Ah!

257
00:11:22.353 --> 00:11:24.687
Follow me.

258
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.186
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hey!


259
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.854
You got a new customer here.

260
00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.086
Snag her a pair

261
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.186
of those heavy duty,
lifetime-guarantee work gloves.


262
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.286
You got it.

263
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.987
So you live here?

264
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.787
When I'm not on the road,
Parable's my safe-haven.


265
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.587
Yeah. That "safe-haven" being
a thousand-acre ranch.


266
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.920
She even has
a private runway for her jet.


267
00:11:42.053 --> 00:11:44.520
So I can get here quicker
and stay longer.


268
00:11:44.653 --> 00:11:46.286
And we wouldn't want it
any other way.


269
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.487
She's done us proud.

270
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.387
Aw.

271
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.286
I'm Tara, Tara Kendall,
by the way.


272
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.553
I'm spending the summer here.

273
00:11:51.687 --> 00:11:53.020
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Tara.


274
00:11:53.153 --> 00:11:54.854
- Yeah, welcome to Parable.
- Thanks.


275
00:11:54.987 --> 00:11:56.887
Now, you take good care of her
now, Leonard, d'you hear?


276
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.920
I'll do my darnedest.

277
00:11:58.053 --> 00:11:58.954
'Kay. See you later.

278
00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:00.053
Bye.

279
00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:01.320
Wow!

280
00:12:01.453 --> 00:12:02.653
It's pretty cool, right?

281
00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:04.653
So cool!

282
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.320
-
- Okay, okay!


283
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.086
Okay, you guys.
Sorry I'm late.


284
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.854
There you go.
There you go.


285
00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.787
Ow!

286
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.186
No! No-no-no-no!
No-no-no-no!


287
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.220
No, no.

288
00:12:39.353 --> 00:12:40.720
Get back here!

289
00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:43.520
Oh, no-no-no-no-no!

290
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.587
Come on.
Get back here.


291
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.987
Come on,
let's go see your friends.


292
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.987
Come on.

293
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.820
No, no.

294
00:12:49.954 --> 00:12:51.120
No. No. No, no, no.

295
00:12:51.253 --> 00:12:52.453
Go this way. Go this way.
Come on.


296
00:12:52.587 --> 00:12:54.186
Whoa! Almost. All right.

297
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.520
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Come on.


298
00:12:56.653 --> 00:12:58.120
Not underneath the truck!

299
00:12:58.253 --> 00:12:59.954
Oh!

300
00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:03.520
Okay. All right.
Come on.


301
00:13:03.653 --> 00:13:04.887
You can do it!

302
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.053
Tch-tch-tch-tch.

303
00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:08.220
She looks pretty comfortable
under there, huh?


304
00:13:08.353 --> 00:13:09.653
Oh!

305
00:13:09.787 --> 00:13:11.020
I'm-
- I'm sorry, I--

306
00:13:11.153 --> 00:13:12.620
No problem. No worries.

307
00:13:12.754 --> 00:13:13.720
She can't go anywhere.

308
00:13:13.854 --> 00:13:16.954
So, you, uh, you must be
renting Joanna's place?


309
00:13:17.086 --> 00:13:18.787
Yes. For the summer.

310
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920
Do you know the Barlows?

311
00:13:20.053 --> 00:13:21.487
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you could say that.


312
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.186
This is Parable, ma'am.
Everybody knows everybody.


313
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.854
Well, then it's not "ma'am,"
it's Tara.


314
00:13:25.987 --> 00:13:26.987
Tara Kendall.

315
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.820
Tara. Nice to meet you.
I'm Boone Taylor.


316
00:13:28.954 --> 00:13:30.120
This is my place.

317
00:13:31.954 --> 00:13:34.487
Now, why do I feel like
I know you from somewhere?


318
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.954
The gas station,
the other day.


319
00:13:37.086 --> 00:13:38.120
Yes, I remember--

320
00:13:38.253 --> 00:13:40.053
uh, red convertible,
New York plates?


321
00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.453
You will be pleased to know

322
00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:44.353
that I escaped
with my purse unsnatched.


323
00:13:44.487 --> 00:13:46.854
Oh, I am pleased, yeah.

324
00:13:46.987 --> 00:13:48.053
Because if it had been snatched,

325
00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:49.387
it'd make
a lot of extra work for me.


326
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.353
I'd have to hunt the guy down,
bring him to justice...


327
00:13:52.487 --> 00:13:54.787
and just imagine
all the paperwork.


328
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.286
Oh, you don't like your job?

329
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.720
I like fishing better.

330
00:13:57.854 --> 00:13:58.820
Mm.

331
00:13:58.954 --> 00:14:01.186
Ooh!

332
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.353
What happened to your hand?

333
00:14:02.487 --> 00:14:04.186
Oh, uh, chicken bit me.

334
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.286
Yeah, you need gloves
with that breed.


335
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.620
Yeah, I forgot to put them on.

336
00:14:07.754 --> 00:14:10.453
Still getting the hang
of poultry management.


337
00:14:10.587 --> 00:14:11.553
Why don't you just get
the Barlows


338
00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:12.920
to take the chickens
off your hands?


339
00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:15.053
I am in the country
for the summer,


340
00:14:15.186 --> 00:14:17.053
and I'm gonna do
country things.


341
00:14:17.186 --> 00:14:18.487
Okay, well, let's, uh,

342
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.553
let's see if we can
get this chicken.


343
00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:22.553
Come here.

344
00:14:22.687 --> 00:14:23.553
Where'd you go?

345
00:14:23.687 --> 00:14:25.453
There we go!

346
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.086
Now, you think you can
get this bad boy home safe?


347
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.553
I will give it
the old college try.


348
00:14:31.687 --> 00:14:32.754
All right,
the important part here


349
00:14:32.887 --> 00:14:34.553
is to try
and hold it tight enough


350
00:14:34.687 --> 00:14:35.553
so it can't fly away,

351
00:14:35.687 --> 00:14:37.553
but not so tight
that you smother it.


352
00:14:37.687 --> 00:14:39.620
There you go! Perfect.

353
00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:43.387
Hey. Well, thank you
for saving the day.


354
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.854
It's fine. Of course.

355
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.854
Oh, uh, you should
give me your e-mail.


356
00:14:48.987 --> 00:14:50.620
My e-mail?

357
00:14:50.754 --> 00:14:52.120
Yeah, then I'll give you mine
and my cell phone number.


358
00:14:52.253 --> 00:14:54.086
I think folks around here
ought to have a way


359
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.120
to get ahold of one another.

360
00:14:55.253 --> 00:14:56.353
Of course.

361
00:14:56.487 --> 00:15:00.653
Uh, mine is
tkendall@nyftu.org.


362
00:15:00.787 --> 00:15:03.053
"NYFTU..."
I don't know that one.


363
00:15:03.186 --> 00:15:05.353
Uh, "New York
Federated Teachers' Union."


364
00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:07.186
So you're a teacher!

365
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.854
Oh, that's would explain
the summer rental.


366
00:15:09.987 --> 00:15:11.854
Well, excellent detective work, Sheriff.

367
00:15:11.987 --> 00:15:13.186
Oh, I've been known
to summon the chops


368
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.353
from time to time.

369
00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:16.153
As long as it doesn't interfere
with your fishing?


370
00:15:16.286 --> 00:15:17.653
All right, well,
we'll be on our way.


371
00:15:17.787 --> 00:15:18.954
- Okay.
- Thanks again.


372
00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:19.820
Bye.

373
00:15:19.954 --> 00:15:20.854
Good luck!

374
00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:24.020
Hi, buddy.

375
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.186
Joanna!

376
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.286
- Hey, you.
- Hey.


377
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.453
How's everything going?

378
00:15:30.587 --> 00:15:33.086
Well, I figured out
how the gas works,


379
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.286
I've stopped looking for
the New York Times


380
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.954
on the front porch
every morning,


381
00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:38.854
a chicken hasn't
bitten me in days--


382
00:15:38.987 --> 00:15:41.453
although, I have been tempted
to bite a few of them.


383
00:15:41.587 --> 00:15:43.353
Well, if anything comes up
that needs tending,


384
00:15:43.487 --> 00:15:44.353
you let me know.

385
00:15:44.487 --> 00:15:45.620
I love to ride and--

386
00:15:45.754 --> 00:15:48.787
are there stables in the area
that I could rent a horse?


387
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.186
Uh, not that I know of,

388
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.954
but you're more than welcome
to come to the ranch


389
00:15:52.086 --> 00:15:53.086
and ride one of ours.

390
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.420
Oh, I wouldn't
want to impose.


391
00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.420
Please, it would not be
an imposition at all.


392
00:15:56.553 --> 00:15:58.987
Although, you know,
Boone Taylor has horses,


393
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.420
and he lives
right next door to you.


394
00:16:00.553 --> 00:16:02.954
Oh, yeah,
I've seen his horses.


395
00:16:04.053 --> 00:16:05.020
Do you think he'd rent me one?

396
00:16:05.153 --> 00:16:07.053
Not in a million years!

397
00:16:07.186 --> 00:16:09.353
But he'd let you ride one.

398
00:16:09.487 --> 00:16:11.720
You should get to know him.
He's a nice guy.


399
00:16:11.854 --> 00:16:13.253
Oh, we've met.

400
00:16:13.387 --> 00:16:16.286
Um, but let me
ask you something.


401
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.920
I've seen two boys...

402
00:16:20.053 --> 00:16:21.987
Oh. Yeah.
Griffin and Fletcher.


403
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.653
But no mom.
Is he divorced?


404
00:16:24.787 --> 00:16:26.487
He's widowed.
Three years now.


405
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.587
Oh, that's awful.

406
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.220
Yeah. Corrie
was pretty wonderful.


407
00:16:29.353 --> 00:16:30.720
We all loved her.

408
00:16:30.854 --> 00:16:31.720
Well, I should go.

409
00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:32.754
It was really good
to see you, Tara.


410
00:16:32.887 --> 00:16:33.887
You, too.

411
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:34.920
Hey!

412
00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:37.520
If you're not doing anything
Friday night,


413
00:16:37.653 --> 00:16:40.086
I recommend you get yourself
to the Parable Saloon.


414
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.353
How come?

415
00:16:41.487 --> 00:16:45.120
Casey Elfman is working on
material for her next album.


416
00:16:45.253 --> 00:16:47.520
Wow, uh...
yeah, I'm not missing that.


417
00:16:47.653 --> 00:16:49.220
Good!
Okay, we'll see you there.


418
00:16:49.353 --> 00:16:50.653
- Thanks! Bye.
- Bye.


419
00:16:54.387 --> 00:16:55.520
Erin! Hi.

420
00:16:55.653 --> 00:16:56.754
Hi, Tara.

421
00:16:56.887 --> 00:16:58.053
See? I'm trying.

422
00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:00.320
What's up?

423
00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:03.453
Uh, I just came in from a ride
and I was thinking about you.


424
00:17:03.587 --> 00:17:04.620
How are you?

425
00:17:04.754 --> 00:17:05.620
Not great.

426
00:17:05.754 --> 00:17:06.887
What's going on?

427
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.420
Dad wants to send me to camp.

428
00:17:08.553 --> 00:17:09.487
Oh, that could be fun.

429
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.387
It's in Maine.
For six weeks.


430
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.887
Oh.

431
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.453
The whole point
of you going away


432
00:17:16.587 --> 00:17:19.120
is for me to spend time
with Dad and Bethany,


433
00:17:19.253 --> 00:17:21.053
but now they want
to get rid of me.


434
00:17:21.186 --> 00:17:22.920
I'm sure that's not true.

435
00:17:23.053 --> 00:17:25.120
Yes, it is.

436
00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:26.553
Can you please talk to him?

437
00:17:26.687 --> 00:17:27.920
Erin...

438
00:17:28.053 --> 00:17:29.487
Please?

439
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.754
No. I can't.

440
00:17:31.887 --> 00:17:34.553
You guys have to work
these things out on your own.


441
00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:36.453
I'll be miserable
in Maine.


442
00:17:36.587 --> 00:17:38.687
Then tell your dad
that you don't want to.


443
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.920
If Bethany becomes my new mom,
I'm going to die.


444
00:17:42.053 --> 00:17:43.286
No, you won't.
You'll be fine.


445
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.520
I promise you.

446
00:17:44.653 --> 00:17:46.720
I just miss you so much.

447
00:17:46.854 --> 00:17:48.353
I miss you, too.

448
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.954
I should probably go.

449
00:17:51.086 --> 00:17:52.687
The new nanny's probably coming
to pick me up.


450
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.153
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

451
00:17:54.286 --> 00:17:55.353
Okay. Bye.

452
00:17:55.487 --> 00:17:57.220
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

453
00:18:36.687 --> 00:18:37.987
Hello?

454
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.220
Boone? It's Tara.

455
00:18:40.353 --> 00:18:42.887
There's someone in my house.

456
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.787
Okay, well, go outside.
I'll be right there.


457
00:18:54.286 --> 00:18:55.220
You all right?

458
00:18:55.353 --> 00:18:56.820
Yeah, I am. He's inside.

459
00:18:56.954 --> 00:18:57.720
You saw him?

460
00:18:57.854 --> 00:18:58.887
No, I could hear him.

461
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.186
I think he's in the kitchen.

462
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.653
Okay, you stay right here.

463
00:19:01.787 --> 00:19:02.987
Okay. Be careful!

464
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.453
Yes.

465
00:19:18.253 --> 00:19:19.153
It's Hiram.

466
00:19:19.286 --> 00:19:20.954
Who's Hiram?

467
00:19:21.086 --> 00:19:22.653
I'm goin' in.

468
00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:24.754
- Be careful!
- Shh! Quiet.


469
00:19:41.887 --> 00:19:43.620
Well, that should do it.

470
00:19:43.754 --> 00:19:44.987
Shooed him out the back door.

471
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.487
What? You didn't arrest him?

472
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.086
I was going to, but...

473
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.787
he's a raccoon,
so it'd be weird--


474
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.053
tiny handcuffs.

475
00:19:53.186 --> 00:19:55.387
Oh, come on!

476
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.754
Should we go take a look?

477
00:19:56.887 --> 00:19:58.320
Yes.

478
00:19:58.453 --> 00:20:00.820
I thought it was funny.
Come on!


479
00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.453
Well, at least
he hasn't learned


480
00:20:07.587 --> 00:20:09.620
how to open
the refrigerator yet.


481
00:20:09.754 --> 00:20:10.787
He does this a lot?

482
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.987
Whenever opportunity
presents itself.


483
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.653
The, uh, the latch on the window
that he came through


484
00:20:16.787 --> 00:20:17.954
must be broken.

485
00:20:18.086 --> 00:20:21.453
I can't believe
I was so scared of a raccoon.


486
00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.487
Oh, I wouldn't be embarrassed
about that.


487
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.887
I'll bet you
that if I was in New York


488
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.520
and heard a bunch of
weird noises like that,


489
00:20:26.653 --> 00:20:27.787
I'd be just as rattled.

490
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.387
Back there, in New York,

491
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.253
I am universally acknowledged
for my savvy and competence.


492
00:20:34.387 --> 00:20:36.487
Here... not so much.

493
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.053
Ah, you'll get the hang of it.

494
00:20:38.186 --> 00:20:39.487
Thank you for saving the day.

495
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.120
Again.

496
00:20:42.253 --> 00:20:44.787
Apparently, your new job
is to run interference


497
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.920
with me
and Parable's animal kingdom.


498
00:20:48.353 --> 00:20:50.120
Don't worry about it.
it's my pleasure.


499
00:20:50.253 --> 00:20:52.920
Ah, what do you say we start
cleaning up this mess?


500
00:20:53.053 --> 00:20:53.920
Oh, no, no, no, no.

501
00:20:54.053 --> 00:20:55.453
You should get back
to your boys.


502
00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.820
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got this.


503
00:20:57.954 --> 00:20:59.253
Let me walk you out.

504
00:20:59.387 --> 00:21:02.820
I won't argue with you.
All right.


505
00:21:08.653 --> 00:21:11.286
- Hey!
- Dad, where were you?


506
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.887
There was
an emergency next door.


507
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.687
What're you guys doing up?

508
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.186
Fletcher had
one of his nightmares.


509
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.053
Oh, buddy.

510
00:21:19.186 --> 00:21:20.186
Come here.

511
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.820
Ohh...

512
00:21:21.954 --> 00:21:23.653
it's like picking up
a baby rhino now.


513
00:21:23.787 --> 00:21:25.553
You're getting so big.

514
00:21:25.687 --> 00:21:27.820
I made him warm milk
like you do, Dad.


515
00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:31.220
Oh. Best brother
in the world, hmm?


516
00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.320
Listen, Fletch.

517
00:21:34.453 --> 00:21:35.854
Everybody has nightmares.

518
00:21:35.987 --> 00:21:37.020
Do you?

519
00:21:37.153 --> 00:21:38.887
Yes! Of course I do.

520
00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.120
Yeah. It's just...
just part of life, you know?


521
00:21:43.253 --> 00:21:44.553
But here's the thing

522
00:21:44.687 --> 00:21:46.653
that you have to remember
about nightmares,


523
00:21:46.787 --> 00:21:48.487
and this is
really important, okay?


524
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.787
You always wake up.

525
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.220
And when you do,
everything's gonna be okay.


526
00:21:56.353 --> 00:21:58.487
And your brother and I
will always be there


527
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.587
to make sure
that everything is okay.


528
00:22:03.687 --> 00:22:04.520
Yeah?

529
00:22:04.653 --> 00:22:06.120
- Yeah.
- You got it?


530
00:22:06.253 --> 00:22:07.754
Now, it's late.

531
00:22:07.887 --> 00:22:09.920
You guys got to
get to bed, okay?


532
00:22:10.053 --> 00:22:12.286
Off you go! Boom.

533
00:22:13.353 --> 00:22:14.553
Goodnight!

534
00:22:14.687 --> 00:22:16.520
Goodnight.

535
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.253
Found this on the bookshelf.
I bet it was your grandfather's.


536
00:22:49.387 --> 00:22:51.086
You should give it a try.

537
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.453
I don't think
that's on my reading list.


538
00:22:53.587 --> 00:22:55.487
I'm sure it's not!

539
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.220
Kind of looks like Montana.

540
00:22:58.353 --> 00:23:00.120
It's a Western.
It's a whole genre--


541
00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:01.253
cowboys, shoot-'em-ups--

542
00:23:01.387 --> 00:23:02.487
they can be a lot of fun.

543
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.453
More eggs?

544
00:23:03.587 --> 00:23:05.920
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you.


545
00:23:11.787 --> 00:23:13.587
Thanks again for the book.
I'll return it when I'm done.


546
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.754
Oh, no rush.

547
00:23:14.887 --> 00:23:16.820
And your grandfather
has a whole collection of those,


548
00:23:16.954 --> 00:23:17.854
if you want to read more.

549
00:23:17.987 --> 00:23:18.987
Oh, cool!

550
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120
Hey, guys!

551
00:23:20.253 --> 00:23:21.186
Hey, Dawson.

552
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.353
Hey, Dawson.
How you doin', bud?


553
00:23:22.487 --> 00:23:23.487
I'm good.
How are you guys?


554
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.587
- Good.
- Good to see you.


555
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.687
Good morning, Boone.

556
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.820
Good morning, Tara.

557
00:23:26.954 --> 00:23:28.487
Uh, I would like
to introduce you


558
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.587
to Fletcher and Griffin.

559
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.120
- Boys, this is Tara.
- Ma'am.


560
00:23:31.253 --> 00:23:32.186
Pleasure to meet you, boys.

561
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.920
Uh, a little something came up
this morning,


562
00:23:34.053 --> 00:23:36.387
and I was hoping that maybe
I could ask a favor.


563
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.420
Of course.

564
00:23:37.553 --> 00:23:39.320
I have a court appearance
in Missoula today.


565
00:23:39.453 --> 00:23:40.620
Did the lawman break the law?

566
00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:43.653
No. But a fella
who had one too many


567
00:23:43.787 --> 00:23:44.754
and took his truck
for a spin did.


568
00:23:44.887 --> 00:23:46.153
How can I help?

569
00:23:46.286 --> 00:23:48.320
Well, they up and canceled
day camp today,


570
00:23:48.453 --> 00:23:49.620
and I really didn't want

571
00:23:49.754 --> 00:23:51.020
to leave the boys at home
by themselves.


572
00:23:51.153 --> 00:23:52.920
- We'll be fine, Dad!
- Zip it.


573
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.687
I would be delighted
to have some company.


574
00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.620
I've made a fresh pitcher
of lemonade.


575
00:23:59.754 --> 00:24:01.620
I don't like lemonade.
It's too sweet.


576
00:24:01.754 --> 00:24:04.787
Well, you'll like mine, then,
because it's just sweet enough.


577
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.020
Well, there you go.

578
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:07.954
All right, you two.
You behave.


579
00:24:08.086 --> 00:24:08.987
Thank you.

580
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.320
Good luck!

581
00:24:10.453 --> 00:24:11.487
Come on, boys.

582
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.987
All right.
What do you want to do?


583
00:24:20.053 --> 00:24:21.920
I'm glad you like it.

584
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.420
Not too sweet?

585
00:24:24.553 --> 00:24:25.854
No. It's good.

586
00:24:25.987 --> 00:24:27.754
Do you have any threes?

587
00:24:28.653 --> 00:24:29.920
Ah, let's see.

588
00:24:31.587 --> 00:24:32.720
Yes.

589
00:24:36.854 --> 00:24:37.954
I win.

590
00:24:38.086 --> 00:24:39.487
Again?

591
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.587
Now I know
why you taught me this game.


592
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.387
Our mom taught it to us.

593
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.220
I wish I had the chance
to play it with her.


594
00:24:50.353 --> 00:24:53.286
She would've beat you.
Every time.


595
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.153
I'm sure she would have.

596
00:24:57.487 --> 00:24:58.854
You must miss her.

597
00:24:58.987 --> 00:25:01.086
I do. All the time.

598
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.487
But "she loved us very much,

599
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.920
and she wouldn't have left us
for anything in the world,


600
00:25:06.053 --> 00:25:07.220
if she could've helped it."

601
00:25:07.353 --> 00:25:08.487
My dad told us that.

602
00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.086
I'm sure she wouldn't have.

603
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.854
We're doing just fine.

604
00:25:12.987 --> 00:25:15.053
Not every family has a mom,
you know.


605
00:25:15.186 --> 00:25:16.520
We're not that unusual.

606
00:25:16.653 --> 00:25:18.086
That's true.

607
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.620
I still miss her.

608
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.353
Of course, you do.

609
00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:23.520
Another game?

610
00:25:23.653 --> 00:25:26.086
Sure, but I am still
not playing for money.


611
00:25:29.453 --> 00:25:30.520
-
- Hey, Dad.


612
00:25:30.653 --> 00:25:31.520
Hey, boys.

613
00:25:31.653 --> 00:25:33.553
House is still standing.
That's a good sign.


614
00:25:33.687 --> 00:25:34.553
Race ya.

615
00:25:34.687 --> 00:25:37.086
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Boys!

616
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.086
What do you say?

617
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.487
- Thank you, ma'am!
- Thanks, Tara.


618
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.520
-
- Anytime!


619
00:25:41.653 --> 00:25:42.987
They're good boys.

620
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.186
Yeah. I think so.

621
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.520
They act like tough guys,

622
00:25:46.653 --> 00:25:48.587
but they're really
a couple of softies at heart.


623
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.887
I guess they take after
their mother.


624
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.353
So, was justice served
in Missoula?


625
00:25:53.487 --> 00:25:54.820
Gotta wait for
the jury to weigh in,


626
00:25:54.954 --> 00:25:56.653
but I did my part.

627
00:25:56.787 --> 00:25:58.887
But now...

628
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.887
I'm gonna fix
that broken window latch.


629
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.954
You don't have to do that.

630
00:26:03.086 --> 00:26:04.053
Oh, I know I don't,

631
00:26:04.186 --> 00:26:06.453
but can't Hiram or his friends
waking you up--


632
00:26:06.587 --> 00:26:07.687
I need my sleep.

633
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.954
Don't worry,
it'll just take a minute.


634
00:26:09.086 --> 00:26:12.086
But I'm thinking that maybe...

635
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.120
yeah.

636
00:26:13.253 --> 00:26:14.954
Yeah, it's gonna cost you.

637
00:26:15.086 --> 00:26:16.153
Oh?

638
00:26:16.286 --> 00:26:17.887
Yeah, I wanna see how unsweet
that lemonade really is.


639
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.253
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.


640
00:26:19.387 --> 00:26:20.687
Yeah? All right.

641
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.820
Well, um, right this way.

642
00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:26.320
Great. So, really, the kids--
the kids were behaved?


643
00:26:32.186 --> 00:26:35.520
Now, that
is what I'm talkin' about.


644
00:26:35.653 --> 00:26:37.320
Too much sugar's
a deal-breaker.


645
00:26:37.453 --> 00:26:38.954
Amen to that!

646
00:26:39.086 --> 00:26:41.320
Ooh, that's good.

647
00:26:43.754 --> 00:26:45.954
Joanna told me
about your wife,


648
00:26:46.086 --> 00:26:49.120
and the boys and I talked
about it a bit today.


649
00:26:50.253 --> 00:26:51.553
I'm so sorry.

650
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.787
Thank you.

651
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.553
That must have been hard.

652
00:26:59.887 --> 00:27:01.420
Yeah.

653
00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:03.453
Yeah, it was.

654
00:27:06.153 --> 00:27:09.387
But, you know,
it's been a while and, um...


655
00:27:10.387 --> 00:27:12.653
...well, things are starting
to get a little bit better.


656
00:27:12.787 --> 00:27:13.854
Anyway, how about you?

657
00:27:13.987 --> 00:27:15.787
You, uh, you ever been married?

658
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.153
Yeah.

659
00:27:17.286 --> 00:27:18.987
Uh, divorced now.

660
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:19.820
Ah.

661
00:27:19.954 --> 00:27:21.053
It got pretty ugly.

662
00:27:21.186 --> 00:27:22.420
Now that sounds hard.

663
00:27:22.553 --> 00:27:24.687
It's pretty complicated with...

664
00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.220
with me and James.

665
00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:27.620
That's my ex.

666
00:27:27.754 --> 00:27:30.120
We share a daughter together,
it--


667
00:27:30.253 --> 00:27:31.620
his daughter, technically,

668
00:27:31.754 --> 00:27:32.987
from--
from a previous marriage,


669
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.820
but she was so little
when her mom died,


670
00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:38.820
she doesn't...
she doesn't remember.


671
00:27:38.954 --> 00:27:41.286
I'm the only mother
she's ever known.


672
00:27:42.687 --> 00:27:44.153
It's gonna be hard
to be that mom,


673
00:27:44.286 --> 00:27:45.286
now that you're divorced.

674
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.854
Yeah.

675
00:27:47.987 --> 00:27:51.053
That's what hurts the most.

676
00:27:52.153 --> 00:27:54.487
I have a question, Boone.

677
00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.153
Hmm?

678
00:27:56.286 --> 00:27:58.720
Those beautiful horses
of yours...


679
00:27:58.854 --> 00:28:02.420
I love to ride,
and, um, well,


680
00:28:02.553 --> 00:28:04.587
I was wondering if, um,

681
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.020
if you would consider renting me
one from time to time?


682
00:28:09.153 --> 00:28:12.453
No, no. Not in a million years.
I don't rent horses.


683
00:28:12.587 --> 00:28:13.553
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't--

684
00:28:13.687 --> 00:28:16.820
But if you wanna take one
for a ride sometime,


685
00:28:16.954 --> 00:28:18.120
come on by.

686
00:28:19.854 --> 00:28:22.420
Okay, it wasn't that funny.

687
00:28:22.553 --> 00:28:24.887
Joanna told me
that you would say that.


688
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.220
Well, so much
for the man of mystery, huh?


689
00:28:27.353 --> 00:28:30.020
Thank you for watching the boys.

690
00:28:30.153 --> 00:28:32.587
Well, thank you
for fixing the latch.


691
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.120
To protect and serve, ma'am.

692
00:28:34.253 --> 00:28:36.220
It's the lawman's code.

693
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.720
Oh!

694
00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:45.720
You should get yourself
to the saloon on Friday night.


695
00:28:45.854 --> 00:28:48.153
I know. Casey Elfman.

696
00:28:49.053 --> 00:28:50.120
- Joanna told me.
- Ah.


697
00:28:50.253 --> 00:28:51.186
- Yeah.
- Okay.


698
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.587
See you there.

699
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.987
- See you there.
- Okay.


700
00:29:04.053 --> 00:29:05.020
Hey! You made it!

701
00:29:05.153 --> 00:29:07.920
Oh, I wouldn't have
missed this for the world.


702
00:29:08.053 --> 00:29:09.553
- Boone.
- Hey, Tara. How're you doing?


703
00:29:09.687 --> 00:29:11.420
Everyone...

704
00:29:11.553 --> 00:29:12.687
this is Tara Kendall.

705
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.653
She's renting Mom and Dad's
place for the summer.


706
00:29:14.787 --> 00:29:15.687
- Hi.
- Hi.


707
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.153
Slade Barlow,
and I'm shackled to this one.


708
00:29:18.286 --> 00:29:21.353
And grateful
every day of his life for it.


709
00:29:21.487 --> 00:29:23.754
Hutch Carmody.
My wife, Kendra.


710
00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:26.120
Ahh. This is stunning.

711
00:29:26.253 --> 00:29:27.820
Thank you.
Nice to meet you all.


712
00:29:27.954 --> 00:29:29.120
I didn't miss anything,
did I?


713
00:29:29.253 --> 00:29:29.954
- No.
- Nope.


714
00:29:30.086 --> 00:29:31.286
Just, uh, just in time.

715
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.587
Here she comes.

716
00:29:33.487 --> 00:29:34.353
Howdy, neighbors!

717
00:29:35.987 --> 00:29:38.720

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:43.687

there could be.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.353
I just got out of
a terrible divorce


807
00:33:55.487 --> 00:33:57.053
a little over
a year ago, Kendra.


808
00:33:57.186 --> 00:33:59.086
I'm not looking
to get involved with anyone.


809
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.387
This does not
have to be a "forever" thing,


810
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.954
especially seeing as you're only
here until September.


811
00:34:04.086 --> 00:34:06.587
I came to Parable
to unclutter my life.


812
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.887
The last thing I need
is a romantic complication.


813
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.220
All right, fine.
Fair enough.


814
00:34:12.353 --> 00:34:15.620
But thanks for not saying
it's none of my darn business!


815
00:34:16.887 --> 00:34:18.353
It was really great meeting you.

816
00:34:18.487 --> 00:34:19.320
You too.

817
00:34:19.453 --> 00:34:21.453
I'll see you tomorrow.

818
00:34:26.553 --> 00:34:27.754
Morning, boys.

819
00:34:27.887 --> 00:34:28.720
Hi, Tara.

820
00:34:28.854 --> 00:34:30.153
- Hey there.
- Hey.


821
00:34:30.286 --> 00:34:32.387
So, this morning,
you get your choice,


822
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.920
but I gotta be honest,
I gotta warn ya,


823
00:34:35.053 --> 00:34:36.954
Bert...
he's a little ornery.


824
00:34:37.086 --> 00:34:38.620
And Ernie here,
he's even worse.


825
00:34:40.487 --> 00:34:42.453
Hmm.

826
00:34:43.653 --> 00:34:45.920
You don't scare me, Ernie...

827
00:34:46.053 --> 00:34:46.787
Ah-hah!

828
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.720
And I have a soft spot
for gingers.


829
00:34:48.854 --> 00:34:50.020
Well, then, Ernie it is.

830
00:34:51.053 --> 00:34:52.787
Uh, any good places
to ride?


831
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.453
Yeah, there's a good trail
behind the house--


832
00:34:54.587 --> 00:34:56.587
winds down to the river,
it's a nice run.


833
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.186
Oh, excellent.

834
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.787
Whoa. Uh...

835
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.220
Any, uh, signposts
I should look for along the way?


836
00:35:05.387 --> 00:35:06.253
I'm definitely going with you,

837
00:35:06.387 --> 00:35:07.787
and I can ride that run
in my sleep.


838
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.320
I'm an experienced rider, Boone.

839
00:35:09.453 --> 00:35:10.320
I don't need a wrangler.

840
00:35:10.453 --> 00:35:11.687
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not for you.


841
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.253
No, it's for Bert.

842
00:35:13.387 --> 00:35:14.854
Yeah, if Ernie takes off
without him,


843
00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:16.553
he's gonna get all jealous--
we can't have that.


844
00:35:16.687 --> 00:35:17.987
Seriously?

845
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.520
Oh, yeah. Right, boys?

846
00:35:19.653 --> 00:35:20.487
True, Tara!

847
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.653
We always ride 'em together.

848
00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:23.420
Always ride 'em together.

849
00:35:23.553 --> 00:35:26.587
Well, you better keep up...

850
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.920
'cause I don't like
being slowed down.


851
00:35:30.053 --> 00:35:31.120
Oh, is that right?

852
00:35:31.253 --> 00:35:32.120
That's right.

853
00:35:32.253 --> 00:35:33.954
- I'll do my best!
- All right. Keep up!


854
00:35:34.086 --> 00:35:36.687
Let's go.

855
00:35:41.086 --> 00:35:43.053
Wow. She can really ride.

856
00:35:43.186 --> 00:35:44.387
She sure can.

857
00:36:08.387 --> 00:36:10.220
This is so beautiful.

858
00:36:10.353 --> 00:36:12.820
Yeah, I never do
get tired of it.


859
00:36:14.253 --> 00:36:16.520
You know,
the first day I was here,


860
00:36:16.653 --> 00:36:19.954
Joanna asked me if--
if I'd come for the views.


861
00:36:20.954 --> 00:36:22.653
In a way, I did.

862
00:36:22.787 --> 00:36:25.186
How did you know
they were here to be seen?


863
00:36:26.286 --> 00:36:28.253
Well, I came here
to Whisper Creek


864
00:36:28.387 --> 00:36:30.253
for a few weeks
when I was 12.


865
00:36:30.387 --> 00:36:31.153
Ah...

866
00:36:31.286 --> 00:36:33.186
Those weeks,

867
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.520
I've carried them with me.

868
00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.220
When I closed my eyes,
I would...


869
00:36:40.353 --> 00:36:42.720
I would see this place.

870
00:36:42.854 --> 00:36:46.587
You know, it carried me through
a lot of rough times.


871
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.553
Yeah, I know
what you're talking about.


872
00:36:48.687 --> 00:36:53.387
This place, this land,
it just gets in your blood.


873
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.320
Now, I don't know about you, but...

874
00:36:56.453 --> 00:36:57.887
riding makes me hungry.

875
00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.720
Oh, yeah, me too.

876
00:36:58.854 --> 00:37:01.720
Oh!
I'm so happy you said that.


877
00:37:01.854 --> 00:37:03.153
No, you didn't!

878
00:37:03.286 --> 00:37:04.920
Oh, yes, I did.

879
00:37:05.787 --> 00:37:07.653
Thank you so much
for today.


880
00:37:07.787 --> 00:37:10.153
Oh, my gosh, I just--
I love to ride.


881
00:37:10.286 --> 00:37:11.487
You can tell.

882
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.887
You sit a horse as well
as anyone I've ever seen.


883
00:37:15.186 --> 00:37:17.286
Well, I might be useless
around chickens or raccoons,


884
00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.353
but I-- I have been riding
most of my life.


885
00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:21.620
Well, since I came here
as a little girl.


886
00:37:21.754 --> 00:37:23.253
Those first couple of rides,

887
00:37:23.387 --> 00:37:24.787
there's nothing quite like it.

888
00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.987
Nope.

889
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.987
No, there surely isn't.

890
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.620
Listen, um...

891
00:37:29.754 --> 00:37:31.086
tell me.

892
00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.620
How do you feel
about fish?


893
00:37:32.754 --> 00:37:34.687
I love seafood.

894
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.920
No, no, no.
Not eatin' 'em...


895
00:37:37.053 --> 00:37:38.153
catchin' 'em.

896
00:37:38.286 --> 00:37:41.120
Oh, uh, well, I--
I don't know, I've never tried.


897
00:37:41.253 --> 00:37:43.086
I was gonna go tomorrow.

898
00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.120
You could come--
show you how to do it?


899
00:37:46.186 --> 00:37:47.620
Sure. I
-I could do that.

900
00:37:47.754 --> 00:37:50.587
Um, oh,
but I refuse to touch worms.


901
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.120
Pathetic city girl.

902
00:37:53.387 --> 00:37:55.754
Come on,
I'll walk you outta here.


903
00:38:07.186 --> 00:38:08.387
Hey!

904
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.487
Hey! I brought some feed.

905
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.487
Thanks.

906
00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.153
So? How was the ride?

907
00:38:13.286 --> 00:38:14.954
It was pretty great.

908
00:38:15.086 --> 00:38:16.186
Boone rode with me.

909
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.220
Oh, right. "Bert and Ernie."

910
00:38:18.353 --> 00:38:19.954
They do not like
to be separated.


911
00:38:20.086 --> 00:38:21.220
No, they don't.

912
00:38:21.353 --> 00:38:23.220
You know what he did
that was so sweet?


913
00:38:23.353 --> 00:38:25.186
He brought along
a lunch that he'd made.


914
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.053
Oh. He's a thoughtful guy.

915
00:38:27.186 --> 00:38:28.320
Yeah, and the other day,

916
00:38:28.453 --> 00:38:30.720
he-he fixed that broken window,
without me even asking.


917
00:38:30.854 --> 00:38:32.720
You know, it has been
a long time


918
00:38:32.854 --> 00:38:35.053
since a man's done
nice things for me.


919
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.954
You're starting
to fall for him.


920
00:38:39.253 --> 00:38:41.387
I-I could. I could.
I really could.


921
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.353
But... I can't.

922
00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:44.653
Why not?

923
00:38:44.787 --> 00:38:46.787
Uh, because I'm--
I'm here to regroup.


924
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.620
T
-To heal.

925
00:38:48.754 --> 00:38:50.353
Well, maybe
he can help you do that.


926
00:38:50.487 --> 00:38:51.553
I need to do it on my own.

927
00:38:51.687 --> 00:38:53.220
Well, it's going to be hard
to avoid him--


928
00:38:53.353 --> 00:38:55.153
him living right next door
to you and all.


929
00:38:55.286 --> 00:38:56.153
I know!

930
00:38:56.286 --> 00:38:57.487
- I mean...
- "I mean" what?


931
00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.186
I-
- I--

932
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.653
He asked me to go fishing
with him tomorrow,


933
00:39:01.787 --> 00:39:02.720
and I said yes.

934
00:39:02.854 --> 00:39:04.220
Is that right?

935
00:39:04.353 --> 00:39:05.620
Why did I do that?

936
00:39:05.754 --> 00:39:08.120
I know I should keep him
at an arm's length.


937
00:39:08.253 --> 00:39:09.620
I know I should.

938
00:39:09.754 --> 00:39:10.887
Well, it sounds to me

939
00:39:11.053 --> 00:39:13.253
like you are not at all sure
about what it is you know,


940
00:39:13.387 --> 00:39:15.053
or what you want.

941
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.320
No. I'm not.

942
00:39:19.487 --> 00:39:21.653
I'm not sure at all.

943
00:39:32.987 --> 00:39:35.987
Oh, that's only because
you haven't caught anything yet.


944
00:39:36.153 --> 00:39:37.153
Do you catch a lot?

945
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.253
Most days?
Nothing at all.


946
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.520
But I'm not doing this
for the fish.


947
00:39:41.687 --> 00:39:44.053
For me, this is...

948
00:39:44.153 --> 00:39:46.620
this is meditation.

949
00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:47.787
Yeah, I can see that.

950
00:39:47.954 --> 00:39:49.787
Yeah.

951
00:39:51.153 --> 00:39:53.620
Tell me about Corrie.

952
00:39:53.787 --> 00:39:55.887
What was she like?

953
00:39:56.053 --> 00:39:58.720
My wife...

954
00:39:58.887 --> 00:40:01.520
was so full of life.

955
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.687
She really was.

956
00:40:02.854 --> 00:40:04.053
She just lit up.

957
00:40:04.153 --> 00:40:06.620
Every single day,
she just lit up.


958
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.720
We were partners.

959
00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:12.520
Best friends,
right from the get-go.


960
00:40:12.687 --> 00:40:14.987
That's the relationship
I was hoping--


961
00:40:15.153 --> 00:40:16.887
wanted--

962
00:40:16.987 --> 00:40:20.353
...expected to have
with James.


963
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.153
No matter how much I gave,

964
00:40:23.253 --> 00:40:25.520
I got next to nothing in return.

965
00:40:25.687 --> 00:40:29.687
It sounds like you're blaming
yourself for the divorce.


966
00:40:29.787 --> 00:40:31.620
Sometimes, it's hard not to.

967
00:40:31.787 --> 00:40:32.954
But no, I don't.

968
00:40:34.086 --> 00:40:36.053
Good. You shouldn't.

969
00:40:37.487 --> 00:40:40.520
You have a strange effect
on me, Boone Taylor.


970
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.086
Do I? "Strange," huh?

971
00:40:45.253 --> 00:40:46.787
"Strange" good?

972
00:40:47.987 --> 00:40:50.954
Well, when you're interested
in a man,


973
00:40:51.086 --> 00:40:53.253
you probably shouldn't
talk to him


974
00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.487
about your failed marriage,

975
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.520
yet here I am.

976
00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.086
I'm sorry, you lost me when
you said "interested in a man."


977
00:41:03.153 --> 00:41:04.320
Are you?

978
00:41:05.353 --> 00:41:06.887
I am.

979
00:41:12.987 --> 00:41:14.520
Whoa, oh, oh, you got one,
you got one.


980
00:41:14.687 --> 00:41:15.954
You got one!
There you go.


981
00:41:16.086 --> 00:41:16.954
Pull it in, pull it in.
That's it.


982
00:41:17.086 --> 00:41:17.954
You gotta reel it in!

983
00:41:18.086 --> 00:41:19.153
You gotta hold on to the rod.

984
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.420
No, you're doing great!
Just reel it in. Pull it in.


985
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.420
Yeah.

986
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.887
Okay, hold on,
I gotta get the net!


987
00:41:23.987 --> 00:41:26.220
Bring him in, bring him in!
Bring him in, bring him in!


988
00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:27.887
There you go!

989
00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.120
- Look at that!
- Look at that!


990
00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:30.720
You caught your first fish!

991
00:41:30.854 --> 00:41:31.754
Right?

992
00:41:31.887 --> 00:41:34.153
Congratulations.
That was fantastic.


993
00:41:44.253 --> 00:41:46.020
Hello, James.

994
00:41:46.153 --> 00:41:47.453
Tara, hey!

995
00:41:47.587 --> 00:41:49.220
Great to hear your voice.
How are you?


996
00:41:49.353 --> 00:41:50.920
I'm fine.

997
00:41:51.053 --> 00:41:52.687
Uh, why are you calling?

998
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.053
Well, it's... it's Erin.

999
00:41:55.186 --> 00:41:56.120
Is everything okay?

1000
00:41:56.253 --> 00:41:57.687
Not really.
She just chased off


1001
00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.086
the fourth nanny
in three weeks,


1002
00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.720
and now the agency is refusing
to send anyone else.


1003
00:42:01.854 --> 00:42:03.587
Well, she's getting
a little old to have a nanny.


1004
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.787
She's almost 13.

1005
00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.954
Yeah, I know. It's...

1006
00:42:06.086 --> 00:42:08.120
it's not just that.

1007
00:42:08.253 --> 00:42:10.954
It's Bethany--
Erin's being just awful to her.


1008
00:42:11.086 --> 00:42:12.286
I thought,
with me out of the picture,


1009
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.820
this was their time to bond.

1010
00:42:13.954 --> 00:42:15.053
Yeah, that's what I was hoping,

1011
00:42:15.186 --> 00:42:17.120
but it's not exactly
working out that way.


1012
00:42:17.253 --> 00:42:18.653
James, you want something.

1013
00:42:18.787 --> 00:42:20.286
You wouldn't be calling
if you didn't,


1014
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.520
so just tell me what it is.

1015
00:42:21.653 --> 00:42:24.253
Erin and Bethany, they need a--
a break from each other,


1016
00:42:24.387 --> 00:42:25.754
and Beth and I need
some time together,


1017
00:42:25.887 --> 00:42:27.453
just the two of us,
without, you know...


1018
00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:29.086
...Without your daughter
getting underfoot?


1019
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.653
I get it, and that's why
you wanted to send her to camp.


1020
00:42:31.787 --> 00:42:33.987
Oh! You--
You know about that?


1021
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.120
Erin and I may not be able
to see each other, James,


1022
00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:37.754
but we still talk.

1023
00:42:37.887 --> 00:42:39.987
Of course, you do.
Okay! There you go.


1024
00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.954
I was thinking that you might
enjoy a visit from her.


1025
00:42:42.086 --> 00:42:43.186
It was her idea, actually.

1026
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.020
A couple weeks in the country--
maybe longer?


1027
00:42:46.153 --> 00:42:48.687
Might be good for her.

1028
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:49.987
I-
- I could do that.

1029
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.020
Really? 'Cause I can get her
on a plane Tuesday,


1030
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:53.787
or-or Wednesday,
if that works?


1031
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.854
Yeah, either.
Either works fine.


1032
00:42:55.987 --> 00:42:56.887
That would be amazing.

1033
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.587
I'll have my office
make all the arrangements


1034
00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.687
and send you the details.

1035
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.954
Thank you so much, Tara.
I-I really appreciate it.


1036
00:43:02.086 --> 00:43:04.220
You're welcome.

1037
00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:09.653

So, that man
that helped me with my bags--


1052
00:44:09.687 --> 00:44:11.487
was he a real cowboy?

1053
00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.787
The genuine article.

1054
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.987
How do you know?

1055
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.854
Because he stepped up
and helped without being asked.


1056
00:44:18.086 --> 00:44:19.353
So... what do you think?

1057
00:44:20.387 --> 00:44:21.487
It's awesome.

1058
00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.787
Bawk!

1059
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.186
What's that noise?

1060
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.253
Oh, those are the chickens.

1061
00:44:25.387 --> 00:44:26.954
It's way past
their feeding time.


1062
00:44:27.086 --> 00:44:28.587
They're probably suffering
from low-blood sugar.


1063
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.153
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.


1064
00:44:30.286 --> 00:44:32.520
Oh. We got company.

1065
00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.954
- Oh, hey, guys!
- Hi there.


1066
00:44:35.086 --> 00:44:36.487
The boys saw you drive up

1067
00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.787
and they just had
to come and say hi.


1068
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.720
Hi. I'm Fletcher.
This is Griffin.


1069
00:44:40.854 --> 00:44:41.954
I'm Erin.

1070
00:44:42.086 --> 00:44:43.887
Dad says
you're like Tara's daughter,


1071
00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.353
but not her daughter?

1072
00:44:45.487 --> 00:44:46.253
Ooh...

1073
00:44:46.387 --> 00:44:47.954
Awkward, buddy!
Sorry!


1074
00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:51.820
Kind of.
It's a long story.


1075
00:44:53.153 --> 00:44:54.453
Okay, can I help you
with the luggage?


1076
00:44:54.587 --> 00:44:55.887
- Sure.
- Great.


1077
00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.520
Uh... Here we go.

1078
00:44:57.653 --> 00:45:00.587
Automatic. All right.

1079
00:45:02.787 --> 00:45:03.987
Oh!

1080
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.220
Okay.

1081
00:45:08.353 --> 00:45:09.520
Let me help you
with one of those.


1082
00:45:09.653 --> 00:45:10.520
They're heavy.

1083
00:45:10.653 --> 00:45:12.787
No, no, it's fine.
It's balanced this way.


1084
00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.754
These both hers?

1085
00:45:13.887 --> 00:45:14.687
Yeah.

1086
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.387
She's planning on
staying a while.


1087
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.387
I hope so.

1088
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.854
What happened
to the convertible?


1089
00:45:18.987 --> 00:45:21.387
I traded it in.
Didn't feel right anymore.


1090
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.720
Your dad's a real cowboy.

1091
00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:25.820
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

1092
00:45:34.754 --> 00:45:35.720
I'm glad, too.

1093
00:45:35.854 --> 00:45:37.754
Or make me
hang out with Bethany.


1094
00:45:37.887 --> 00:45:40.754
It know it's hard having
a new woman in your dad's life


1095
00:45:40.887 --> 00:45:42.020
and learning to get along
with her,


1096
00:45:42.153 --> 00:45:43.920
but it will be
so much better for you,


1097
00:45:44.053 --> 00:45:45.754
if you do.

1098
00:45:45.887 --> 00:45:46.587
I mean...

1099
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.286
you should at least try.

1100
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.253
I guess.

1101
00:45:53.186 --> 00:45:54.820
Oh! Do you remember
my friend Savannah?


1102
00:45:54.954 --> 00:45:56.754
Yeah, of course.

1103
00:45:56.887 --> 00:46:00.520
Well, she got a nose stud
and it looks awesome.


1104
00:46:00.653 --> 00:46:02.820
Is that right?

1105
00:46:02.954 --> 00:46:04.353
Yeah. So...

1106
00:46:04.487 --> 00:46:06.487
I was thinking, while I'm here,

1107
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.553
why don't I get one, too?

1108
00:46:08.687 --> 00:46:11.186
My answer was "no" in New York,
and it's "no" now,


1109
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.453
not without your dad's consent.

1110
00:46:13.587 --> 00:46:15.720
He didn't even want you to get
your ears pierced, remember?


1111
00:46:15.854 --> 00:46:17.887
Well, Dad doesn't even care
what I do anymore.


1112
00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.887
Well, I do.

1113
00:46:20.887 --> 00:46:22.887
Boone seems like a nice guy.

1114
00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.120
He is.

1115
00:46:24.253 --> 00:46:26.887
Are you guys, like, dating?

1116
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.653
No. Not really.
Just friends.


1117
00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:31.286
"Not really"?

1118
00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.453
He invited us over
for a barbecue this weekend.


1119
00:46:33.587 --> 00:46:35.186
You'll get to meet
some of my other new friends.


1120
00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.487
- Cool.
- Mm-hmm.


1121
00:47:29.387 --> 00:47:31.954
Too lazy to walk over here
and talk to me in person?


1122
00:47:32.086 --> 00:47:33.587
I wasn't invited.

1123
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.787
I'm about to turn in.

1124
00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.053
Yeah, I think
I might do the same thing.


1125
00:47:37.186 --> 00:47:39.620
She's out cold.

1126
00:47:39.754 --> 00:47:42.020
Fell asleep as soon
her head hit the pillow.


1127
00:47:42.153 --> 00:47:43.153
Well, of course, she did.

1128
00:47:43.286 --> 00:47:44.286
She traveled 2,000 miles today

1129
00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.453
without benefit
of covered wagon.


1130
00:47:46.587 --> 00:47:48.553
Hey, what can we bring
to the barbecue?


1131
00:47:48.687 --> 00:47:51.520
I make a killer
red cabbage coleslaw.


1132
00:47:51.653 --> 00:47:55.020
Oh, yeah, bring that.
That sounds fantastic.


1133
00:47:55.153 --> 00:47:57.520
Well, um...

1134
00:47:57.653 --> 00:47:59.053
goodnight.

1135
00:48:03.253 --> 00:48:05.220
Goodnight.

1136
00:48:17.253 --> 00:48:18.320
Thank you.

1137
00:48:18.453 --> 00:48:19.587
Tara!

1138
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.353
- Hi!
- Hi.


1139
00:48:21.487 --> 00:48:24.987
I am still buzzing from
that show you did at the saloon.


1140
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.086
Oh, me too.

1141
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:28.420
Now, how are things going
with your step-daughter?


1142
00:48:28.553 --> 00:48:30.620
News travels fast
in a small town.


1143
00:48:30.754 --> 00:48:32.653
Because we're desperate for it.

1144
00:48:32.787 --> 00:48:34.420
We're having a great time.

1145
00:48:34.553 --> 00:48:37.120
She's out riding
with Griffin Taylor right now.


1146
00:48:37.253 --> 00:48:38.320
Oh, good for her.

1147
00:48:38.453 --> 00:48:39.487
Yeah.

1148
00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:40.920
I have to admit, though,

1149
00:48:41.053 --> 00:48:42.553
it's bittersweet
having her here.


1150
00:48:42.687 --> 00:48:43.887
Why's that?

1151
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.286
Well, she's only here
because it suits my ex, James.


1152
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.186
Ah. One of those.

1153
00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.120
The kind of man I like to call
"Controllo".


1154
00:48:50.253 --> 00:48:52.520
It's always their way
or the highway.


1155
00:48:52.653 --> 00:48:53.787
Yeah. That would be James.

1156
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.620
Oh, they can charm
the pants off you at first,


1157
00:48:55.754 --> 00:48:57.687
make you feel like you're
the center of the universe,


1158
00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.820
but once
they got you hooked--


1159
00:48:58.954 --> 00:49:00.687
bam!
...the other shoe drops.


1160
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.520
Hmph. Yeah. I can relate.

1161
00:49:03.653 --> 00:49:05.053
Problem is,

1162
00:49:05.186 --> 00:49:07.186
those are the kind of guys
I'm attracted to--


1163
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.620
someone who's
as strong-willed as I am.


1164
00:49:09.754 --> 00:49:11.553
Mm. That is a problem.

1165
00:49:11.687 --> 00:49:12.854
Still...

1166
00:49:12.987 --> 00:49:15.653
might be nice to have
a kind, considerate sweetheart


1167
00:49:15.787 --> 00:49:17.687
to come home to.

1168
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.253
Who knows?

1169
00:49:19.387 --> 00:49:21.720
Okay, is everyone in Parable
a matchmaker?


1170
00:49:21.854 --> 00:49:23.487
Well, we look out for our own.

1171
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.053
-
- Good afternoon, ladies.


1172
00:49:25.186 --> 00:49:27.220
I've got two-and-a-half dozen
for you today, Leonard.


1173
00:49:27.353 --> 00:49:29.020
Okay.
I'll put it on your account.


1174
00:49:29.153 --> 00:49:30.954
I'll see you later, sweetie.

1175
00:49:43.053 --> 00:49:45.120
Okay. Try some.

1176
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.487
And... the verdict is?

1177
00:49:54.653 --> 00:49:56.220
This rocks!

1178
00:49:56.353 --> 00:49:58.520
You make the best coleslaw...
"Tara."


1179
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.787
See? It's getting easier
to say, isn't it?


1180
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.920
Not even a little bit.

1181
00:50:04.987 --> 00:50:07.086
Now let's go meet Dawson!

1182
00:50:12.987 --> 00:50:15.020
Nice hit, Dawson!

1183
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.520
That's my boy.

1184
00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.587
Well, that wasn't very good.

1185
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.754
Not very good?
That was pathetic! Boomerang.


1186
00:50:28.887 --> 00:50:29.920
Let's try that one more time.

1187
00:50:30.053 --> 00:50:31.320
I'm gonna help you
a little bit more.


1188
00:50:31.453 --> 00:50:32.887
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.


1189
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.186
Get a nice, smooth stroke going.
That's it.


1190
00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.487
And, at the top of the arc,
you let it go.


1191
00:50:38.353 --> 00:50:39.620
Here we go...

1192
00:50:40.487 --> 00:50:41.220
- Oh!
-


1193
00:50:41.353 --> 00:50:42.353
- Oh, yeah!
-


1194
00:50:42.487 --> 00:50:43.387
Yes!

1195
00:50:52.153 --> 00:50:53.020
- Babe.
- Thank you.


1196
00:50:53.153 --> 00:50:54.854
No problemo.

1197
00:50:54.987 --> 00:50:56.587
Try not to burn the next ones.

1198
00:50:57.653 --> 00:50:59.520
Okay, I never burn them!

1199
00:50:59.653 --> 00:51:00.720
He always burns them.

1200
00:51:01.787 --> 00:51:04.120
It looks like soccer's
made its way into Parable.


1201
00:51:04.253 --> 00:51:05.053
Not quite.

1202
00:51:05.186 --> 00:51:06.553
Dawson tried
to put a team together--


1203
00:51:06.687 --> 00:51:07.620
no luck.

1204
00:51:07.754 --> 00:51:09.987
Mm. It's pretty hard
to field any kind of team


1205
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.954
with a school
as small as ours.


1206
00:51:12.086 --> 00:51:13.787
Mm. And speaking of school--

1207
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.420
I can't believe the wonders
that you have worked on my boy.


1208
00:51:16.553 --> 00:51:17.587
You know, I caught him

1209
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.754
reading under the covers
the other day?


1210
00:51:19.887 --> 00:51:21.553
The Count of Monte Cristo.

1211
00:51:21.687 --> 00:51:24.787
Uh, you got Dawson reading?

1212
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.820
I just pointed him

1213
00:51:25.954 --> 00:51:27.253
towards the books
I thought he might like.


1214
00:51:27.387 --> 00:51:30.253
Aw, do you think you could
get Hutch to read next?


1215
00:51:30.387 --> 00:51:32.053
Oh, then she really would be
a wonder-worker.


1216
00:51:32.186 --> 00:51:33.487
Yeah, she would be.

1217
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.453
You know, I thought about
being a teacher


1218
00:51:35.587 --> 00:51:37.086
when I was younger.

1219
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.653
Truth is, the thought

1220
00:51:38.787 --> 00:51:42.387
of facing a room full of kids
every day


1221
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.487
scared the heck out of me.

1222
00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.153
Oh, it can be daunting,
for sure,


1223
00:51:46.286 --> 00:51:48.053
but when it clicks...

1224
00:51:48.186 --> 00:51:49.754
that's the rewarding part,

1225
00:51:49.887 --> 00:51:50.820
and that's why I do it,

1226
00:51:50.954 --> 00:51:53.453
but it's the other stuff
that drives you nuts--


1227
00:51:53.587 --> 00:51:56.153
the endless staff meetings,
budget crunches,


1228
00:51:56.286 --> 00:51:57.653
school-board interference.

1229
00:51:57.787 --> 00:51:59.787
Oh, we don't have
any of that here.


1230
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.587
Well, not a lot anyway.

1231
00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.220
I basically am
the school board.


1232
00:52:04.353 --> 00:52:05.520
Whoa!

1233
00:52:05.653 --> 00:52:07.520
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
It's on!


1234
00:52:07.653 --> 00:52:08.620
This is on.

1235
00:52:08.754 --> 00:52:10.220
- It is on!
- Yep, it is on.


1236
00:52:10.353 --> 00:52:11.720
Where are you going?

1237
00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.253
Mom?

1238
00:52:30.387 --> 00:52:32.220
So, Dawson wanted to know

1239
00:52:32.353 --> 00:52:34.820
if I can go see the movies
with him later this week?


1240
00:52:34.954 --> 00:52:36.320
Can I?

1241
00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:37.820
I don't see why not.

1242
00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.954
All right, 'kay, listen to me,
I gotta know.


1243
00:52:46.086 --> 00:52:47.286
Know what?

1244
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.220
Have you asked her out yet?

1245
00:52:50.086 --> 00:52:51.720
Yeah, well, we went, uh...

1246
00:52:51.854 --> 00:52:53.854
went riding, went fishin'.

1247
00:52:53.987 --> 00:52:56.153
Ladies like to be
wined and dined, Boone.


1248
00:52:56.286 --> 00:52:58.854
Well, sometimes, yes,
but not always.


1249
00:52:58.987 --> 00:53:01.320
Oh, now you're an expert
on women?


1250
00:53:01.453 --> 00:53:04.253
I'm just trying to get to know
and understand this one.


1251
00:53:04.387 --> 00:53:05.587
Oh, boy.

1252
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.653
You're serious about her.

1253
00:53:07.787 --> 00:53:09.954
I guess I am.

1254
00:53:10.086 --> 00:53:11.053
You know...

1255
00:53:11.186 --> 00:53:13.387
she's not what you think she is,
at first glance.


1256
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.687
City-slicker?

1257
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.053
Come on, guys.
No, no, she's, um...


1258
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.620
She's got real heart, you know?
She's got grit.


1259
00:53:21.754 --> 00:53:23.120
And she's smart as a whip.

1260
00:53:23.253 --> 00:53:24.720
Man, can she ride!

1261
00:53:26.253 --> 00:53:29.520
You know, I think we used
to know a woman just like that.


1262
00:53:29.653 --> 00:53:31.587
You're right.

1263
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.220
Corrie would've
liked her a lot.


1264
00:53:35.253 --> 00:53:38.020
I think she'd be rooting
for you, pal.


1265
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.553
All right, then.

1266
00:53:42.687 --> 00:53:46.420
You guys are too soft--
too soft.


1267
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.620
Hey there.

1268
00:53:49.754 --> 00:53:51.687
You should, uh, you should
take some of these leftovers,


1269
00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.787
'cause I don't think

1270
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.053
the boys and I are
gonna get through all this.


1271
00:53:54.186 --> 00:53:55.553
- Thanks.
- Yeah.


1272
00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.387
I had a really nice time
today, Boone.


1273
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.286
Yeah, I did, too.

1274
00:54:04.653 --> 00:54:06.286
Come on, let's get you
some more food, all right?


1275
00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:18.687
Yeah.

1276
00:54:20.053 --> 00:54:22.520
Can you brush my hair,
like you used to?


1277
00:54:22.653 --> 00:54:24.620
Sure.

1278
00:54:27.954 --> 00:54:29.153
Today was fun.

1279
00:54:29.286 --> 00:54:31.653
It sure was.

1280
00:54:31.787 --> 00:54:33.553
You really like it here,
don't you?


1281
00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:34.920
I love it here.

1282
00:54:35.053 --> 00:54:37.286
Don't you?

1283
00:54:38.387 --> 00:54:40.020
I guess.

1284
00:54:40.153 --> 00:54:42.153
What is it?

1285
00:54:42.286 --> 00:54:43.754
When summer's over,

1286
00:54:43.887 --> 00:54:45.720
you're coming back
to New York, right?


1287
00:54:45.854 --> 00:54:47.487
Of course,
I'm coming back.


1288
00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:51.553
You won't let Boone
talk you into staying?


1289
00:54:51.687 --> 00:54:52.887
Boone?

1290
00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.720
I see the way you guys
look at each other.


1291
00:54:54.854 --> 00:54:57.553
I told you, he's...
he's just a friend.


1292
00:54:57.687 --> 00:55:00.186
Even if he does love you?

1293
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.587
He doesn't love me.

1294
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.320
Well, he's never gonna love you
as much as I do.


1295
00:55:07.453 --> 00:55:08.754
Oh.

1296
00:55:08.887 --> 00:55:11.320
Sweetheart, you are
the heart and soul of me.


1297
00:55:11.453 --> 00:55:13.253
Nothing's ever
gonna change that.


1298
00:55:13.387 --> 00:55:15.587
Not Boone, not anyone.

1299
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.253
All right? Come here.

1300
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.954
I know you like her, Dad.

1301
00:55:31.086 --> 00:55:32.086
Oh, do you, now?

1302
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.553
I like her, too.

1303
00:55:33.687 --> 00:55:34.820
I don't.

1304
00:55:34.954 --> 00:55:37.086
You like her
even though she's a girl?


1305
00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.920
Moms aren't girls.

1306
00:55:39.053 --> 00:55:40.820
She's not our mom!

1307
00:55:42.086 --> 00:55:43.487
Griff. Hey.

1308
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.954
Uh, listen, pal, you just finish
brushing your teeth, okay?


1309
00:55:46.086 --> 00:55:47.820
Get in bed. I'll come tuck
you in in a minute, all right?


1310
00:55:47.954 --> 00:55:49.720
- Okay.
- Thattaboy.


1311
00:56:03.353 --> 00:56:04.787
Wanna talk about it?

1312
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.787
Tch.

1313
00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.387
Come here. Come on.

1314
00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:23.854
You hate the idea

1315
00:56:23.987 --> 00:56:26.453
of someone taking
your mom's place.


1316
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.520
I know.

1317
00:56:29.653 --> 00:56:32.020
I know because I have...

1318
00:56:32.153 --> 00:56:35.720
felt that way
for a very long time, myself.


1319
00:56:39.353 --> 00:56:41.620
You see...

1320
00:56:41.754 --> 00:56:43.687
your mom

1321
00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.954
was so special.

1322
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.720
She just loved us.

1323
00:56:49.854 --> 00:56:52.553
That's all.

1324
00:56:52.687 --> 00:56:54.653
She plain old loved us.

1325
00:56:54.787 --> 00:56:56.387
No ifs, ands, or buts.

1326
00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.220
If we were happy,
she was happy.


1327
00:57:05.487 --> 00:57:07.720
You didn't know this, though...

1328
00:57:10.387 --> 00:57:13.453
...after your mom got sick,

1329
00:57:13.587 --> 00:57:16.453
we used to have these talks--

1330
00:57:16.587 --> 00:57:17.687
late at night,
just the two of us,


1331
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.320
after you guys went to bed.

1332
00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.720
Oh, she made me laugh,

1333
00:57:25.854 --> 00:57:29.820
talking about all the good times
that we'd had.


1334
00:57:31.687 --> 00:57:33.854
And she made me promise her

1335
00:57:33.987 --> 00:57:36.253
that I would always
keep this house


1336
00:57:36.387 --> 00:57:38.887
full of love and fun.

1337
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.053
And she said...

1338
00:57:47.186 --> 00:57:48.387
"Babe,

1339
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.186
don't you spend
the rest of your life


1340
00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.553
pining for me.

1341
00:57:53.687 --> 00:57:55.587
You go live your life."

1342
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.854
Did she really say that?

1343
00:58:00.186 --> 00:58:02.620
She did, bud.

1344
00:58:02.754 --> 00:58:05.253
And she meant it, too.

1345
00:58:05.387 --> 00:58:07.086
I didn't mean
what I said before.


1346
00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:08.153
I do like Tara.

1347
00:58:08.286 --> 00:58:10.186
I know you do.

1348
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.653
But you don't have to worry.

1349
00:58:11.787 --> 00:58:14.120
She's not aiming
to be anybody's new mom.


1350
00:58:14.253 --> 00:58:15.453
Not anytime soon.

1351
00:58:15.587 --> 00:58:17.487
I'll still never forget Mom.

1352
00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.787
Not ever.

1353
00:58:20.887 --> 00:58:22.353
Attaboy.

1354
00:59:05.987 --> 00:59:07.387
Hey!
- Whoa...


1355
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.320
-
- Afternoon.


1356
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.086
Um, ahem, so...

1357
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.086
just as I was
congratulating myself


1358
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.353
on how on top of things
I was getting,


1359
00:59:16.487 --> 00:59:18.587
and how I was never gonna
have to ask my neighbor


1360
00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.687
for help for anything
ever again...


1361
00:59:21.954 --> 00:59:23.020
What's wrong?

1362
00:59:23.153 --> 00:59:25.353
A problem with my water.

1363
00:59:26.787 --> 00:59:28.420
Okay. Sure.
Let's have a look.


1364
00:59:28.553 --> 00:59:29.820
Oh!

1365
00:59:29.954 --> 00:59:31.720
Hey, Boone Taylor.

1366
00:59:31.854 --> 00:59:34.353
Are you a closet
abstract expressionist?


1367
00:59:34.487 --> 00:59:35.854
Is it that bad? Really?

1368
00:59:35.987 --> 00:59:38.053
Ah, they look like floor plans.

1369
00:59:38.186 --> 00:59:39.987
Yeah, I used to love doing
stuff like this, you know?


1370
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.820
Coming up with an idea
and then bringing it to life.


1371
00:59:44.153 --> 00:59:46.186
Yeah. Haven't done that
in a long time.


1372
00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.520
We should see about that water.

1373
00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:51.754
Okay.

1374
00:59:51.887 --> 00:59:53.487
Show me.

1375
00:59:54.653 --> 00:59:55.987
That was so funny.

1376
00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.687
Yeah, kinda
unrealistic, though.


1377
00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.320
It was a movie.

1378
01:00:00.553 --> 01:00:03.854
My favorite part
was the car chase.


1379
01:00:03.987 --> 01:00:04.887
Yeah. That was cool.

1380
01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.053
Yeah.

1381
01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:07.920
What time
does Tara pick you up at?


1382
01:00:08.053 --> 01:00:10.186
Not for a bit.

1383
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.887
Wanna get some ice cream?

1384
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.453
Yeah, sounds great.

1385
01:00:17.787 --> 01:00:19.020
Hmm.

1386
01:00:19.153 --> 01:00:20.420
What's the matter with it?

1387
01:00:20.553 --> 01:00:22.687
That's a good question. Uh...

1388
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.220
Hmm.

1389
01:00:26.353 --> 01:00:27.720
That.

1390
01:00:27.854 --> 01:00:29.253
That is the problem.

1391
01:00:29.387 --> 01:00:30.420
Come on.

1392
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.220
Wow. This is awesome.

1393
01:00:34.353 --> 01:00:35.520
Yeah, I think so,

1394
01:00:35.653 --> 01:00:38.653
but I don't really have much
to compare it to.


1395
01:00:38.787 --> 01:00:41.220
It's as good as anything
I've had in New York, for sure.


1396
01:00:41.353 --> 01:00:42.653
Wow. New York.

1397
01:00:42.787 --> 01:00:44.920
Just the idea of it
makes me nervous.


1398
01:00:45.053 --> 01:00:46.820
It's not as scary as it looks.

1399
01:00:46.954 --> 01:00:47.854
You always lived there?

1400
01:00:47.987 --> 01:00:48.820
Born and raised.

1401
01:00:48.954 --> 01:00:50.854
Wow. Same here.

1402
01:00:50.987 --> 01:00:54.553
Uh, born and raised here,
not there.


1403
01:00:54.687 --> 01:00:57.987
Thanks for the clarification.
Had me confused there.


1404
01:01:01.854 --> 01:01:03.387
Do we fix it?

1405
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.253
Well, the pipe's
gonna need to be replaced.


1406
01:01:05.387 --> 01:01:06.920
I can talk to Joanna
about that.


1407
01:01:07.053 --> 01:01:08.387
I patched it
with some plumber's tape.


1408
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.587
That ought to hold it
for a while.


1409
01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.387
You just happened
to have plumber's tape?


1410
01:01:14.854 --> 01:01:16.053
What kinda handyman
do you take me for?


1411
01:01:16.186 --> 01:01:18.487
Of course, I got plumber's tape.

1412
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.653
Will you show me how to do it?

1413
01:01:20.787 --> 01:01:22.920
In case it happens again?

1414
01:01:24.253 --> 01:01:26.553
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I can do that.


1415
01:01:27.653 --> 01:01:30.820
We should go inside
and, um, cool off.


1416
01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:32.420
I agree.

1417
01:01:32.553 --> 01:01:34.120
Okay, let's go.

1418
01:01:34.253 --> 01:01:36.420
Ahem.

1419
01:01:36.553 --> 01:01:37.754
So, uh...

1420
01:01:37.887 --> 01:01:40.920
Boone's boys tell me
that Tara's not really your mom.


1421
01:01:41.053 --> 01:01:43.620
Well, she married my dad
when I was little, so...


1422
01:01:43.754 --> 01:01:45.086
she's more like my mom
than my stepmom.


1423
01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.720
It's... complicated.

1424
01:01:46.854 --> 01:01:49.053
Yeah, they told me that, too.

1425
01:01:49.186 --> 01:01:51.086
You know, the divorce?

1426
01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.687
It's the worst.

1427
01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.553
Ahh. That is so good.

1428
01:01:57.687 --> 01:01:58.553
Mm.

1429
01:01:58.687 --> 01:02:00.053
Here. Wash off.

1430
01:02:00.186 --> 01:02:01.987
I'll... pour you another.

1431
01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:03.153
Thank you.

1432
01:02:08.453 --> 01:02:10.120
Are you sure
you don't want me to wait?


1433
01:02:10.253 --> 01:02:12.653
No. Tara's never late.

1434
01:02:13.854 --> 01:02:16.453
Um, I'd stay,
but I have chores.


1435
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.887
What?

1436
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.620
Chores. Just sounds...

1437
01:02:20.754 --> 01:02:21.687
...Parable?

1438
01:02:23.253 --> 01:02:26.053
Thanks for the movie.
And the ice cream.


1439
01:02:26.186 --> 01:02:27.353
Yeah, of course.

1440
01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:30.153
Thanks for, you know,
coming along with me.


1441
01:02:30.286 --> 01:02:32.520
Maybe we could do it again
sometime?


1442
01:02:32.653 --> 01:02:34.954
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

1443
01:02:35.086 --> 01:02:37.987
Uh, you said
something about chores?


1444
01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.987
Yeah! Yeah. You're right. Chores.

1445
01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.053
I'd better get to that.

1446
01:02:42.186 --> 01:02:43.820
Well...

1447
01:02:43.954 --> 01:02:45.653
it was really nice to see you.

1448
01:02:45.787 --> 01:02:46.954
- Yeah.
- Bye.


1449
01:02:47.086 --> 01:02:49.053
Bye.

1450
01:02:54.186 --> 01:02:57.020
You...
you missed a spot.


1451
01:02:57.153 --> 01:02:58.153
Oh, did I? Where?

1452
01:02:58.286 --> 01:03:00.754
Right... right here.

1453
01:03:00.887 --> 01:03:02.387
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


1454
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.286
Any better?

1455
01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.620
Little bit, yeah.

1456
01:03:08.253 --> 01:03:10.286
Listen...

1457
01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:16.020
I've been meaning to ask you...

1458
01:03:16.153 --> 01:03:17.787
any more, uh...

1459
01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.120
raccoon home invasions?

1460
01:03:20.553 --> 01:03:22.220
Just the one.

1461
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.420
Good.

1462
01:03:24.553 --> 01:03:26.854
I make sure
to latch the windows.


1463
01:03:28.153 --> 01:03:30.820
Well, you can never
be too careful.


1464
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.620
Hoo...

1465
01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:46.920
It's been a while
since I've done that.


1466
01:03:47.053 --> 01:03:48.220
Yeah.

1467
01:03:48.353 --> 01:03:49.587
Me too.

1468
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.687
Hmm.

1469
01:04:02.887 --> 01:04:04.787
Felt pretty good, though.

1470
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.320
Mm-hmm. Yes.

1471
01:04:07.453 --> 01:04:08.754
It did.

1472
01:04:09.787 --> 01:04:11.286
-

1473
01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.787
Oh.

1474
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.520
-
- Ahem.


1475
01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.453
It's... I'm supposed
to pick up Erin.


1476
01:04:18.587 --> 01:04:19.754
Uh, she's--

1477
01:04:19.887 --> 01:04:22.420
she went to the movies
with Dawson.


1478
01:04:22.553 --> 01:04:23.954
Dawson's a good kid.

1479
01:04:24.086 --> 01:04:27.086
Um, I guess I'll let you
get to it, then.


1480
01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.320
Yeah.

1481
01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:30.520
Okay.

1482
01:04:30.653 --> 01:04:31.787
Uh...

1483
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.520
I will come by later
with some more plumber's tape.


1484
01:04:35.653 --> 01:04:36.954
I'll show you how to do it.

1485
01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.520
Thanks. Yeah.

1486
01:04:39.653 --> 01:04:41.487
Yeah.

1487
01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.587
Right. Gotta go.

1488
01:04:57.253 --> 01:04:58.754
Uh, Tara!

1489
01:04:58.887 --> 01:05:00.954
- Hey!
- Hi, Kendra!


1490
01:05:01.086 --> 01:05:02.820
Hi.

1491
01:05:02.954 --> 01:05:03.954
Hi!

1492
01:05:04.086 --> 01:05:05.854
This is fate.

1493
01:05:05.987 --> 01:05:07.220
I was just gonna call you.

1494
01:05:07.353 --> 01:05:08.353
Oh? What's up?

1495
01:05:08.487 --> 01:05:10.220
Well, one of our teachers
got married in June.


1496
01:05:10.353 --> 01:05:11.487
Oh, that's nice.

1497
01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:14.186
Yeah, but now she's moving
and we have to replace her.


1498
01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.387
Are you interested?

1499
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.020
- In teaching?
- Yeah.


1500
01:05:17.153 --> 01:05:18.954
- Here?
- Yes!


1501
01:05:19.086 --> 01:05:21.787
Now, we can't pay as well as
you would get paid in New York,


1502
01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.687
but our cost of living
is so much lower,


1503
01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.854
and we have
super-small class sizes,


1504
01:05:25.987 --> 01:05:29.153
and you would have
a super-supportive school board,


1505
01:05:29.286 --> 01:05:30.220
who'd always have your back.

1506
01:05:30.353 --> 01:05:31.353
Hmm.

1507
01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:33.487
How much time
did you spend on this pitch?


1508
01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.387
Oh...

1509
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.820
It's pretty good though, right?

1510
01:05:36.954 --> 01:05:38.220
It's good.

1511
01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:40.954
But I have a job
back in New York


1512
01:05:41.086 --> 01:05:43.353
and-and a lease
and a social life,


1513
01:05:43.487 --> 01:05:45.453
and a daughter
that I need to be near to.


1514
01:05:45.587 --> 01:05:47.620
And endless staff meetings,
budget crunches...


1515
01:05:47.754 --> 01:05:49.453
...painful memories.

1516
01:05:49.587 --> 01:05:51.320
Oh, stop it!
You're tempting me.


1517
01:05:51.453 --> 01:05:52.320
Oh!

1518
01:05:52.453 --> 01:05:53.320
I had to ask.

1519
01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:54.387
And I appreciate it.

1520
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.353
Well, we appreciate you.

1521
01:05:56.487 --> 01:05:58.553
You know, you have made
a whole lot of friends


1522
01:05:58.687 --> 01:05:59.620
in a real short time.

1523
01:05:59.754 --> 01:06:00.687
You should know that.

1524
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.453
Thank you, and I...

1525
01:06:02.587 --> 01:06:03.620
I feel the same way.

1526
01:06:03.754 --> 01:06:04.720
Good.

1527
01:06:04.854 --> 01:06:06.620
Well, you enjoy
rest of your day.


1528
01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.387
- Thank you. You too.
- Thanks. I will.


1529
01:06:10.754 --> 01:06:12.053
Think about it!

1530
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.954
Hey!

1531
01:06:28.086 --> 01:06:30.353
Hey.

1532
01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.754
Shouldn't you be out tracking
rustlers and horse thieves?


1533
01:06:33.887 --> 01:06:35.620
Ah, it's a lot of paperwork.

1534
01:06:35.754 --> 01:06:38.086
Anyway, it's my lunchbreak
and, uh...


1535
01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.286
well, I really just wanted
to bring you those.


1536
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.420
Oh. Wow. Thank you.

1537
01:06:43.553 --> 01:06:44.620
They're beautiful.

1538
01:06:44.754 --> 01:06:47.086
I was just wondering that--

1539
01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.086
you know, maybe if you...

1540
01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.754
weren't busy--

1541
01:06:50.887 --> 01:06:52.020
I mean, obviously, you're busy,

1542
01:06:52.153 --> 01:06:54.053
but if you weren't busy
at some point,


1543
01:06:54.186 --> 01:06:56.854
maybe you would want
to go out-- with me...


1544
01:06:56.987 --> 01:06:58.120
This is going badly!

1545
01:06:58.253 --> 01:07:00.053
Um, I can do
way better than this.


1546
01:07:01.387 --> 01:07:03.754
Are you-- Are you asking me
out on a date?


1547
01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:05.687
Yes, ma'am. I am trying.

1548
01:07:07.387 --> 01:07:10.053
Should we really
be doing this?


1549
01:07:11.186 --> 01:07:13.987
I don't know, I can't really
think of any reason why not.


1550
01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.987
The problem is,

1551
01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.587
I could
really fall for you, Boone.


1552
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.854
I...

1553
01:07:20.987 --> 01:07:24.220
to be honest,
I think I already have.


1554
01:07:25.253 --> 01:07:27.820
Well, I'd be lying
if I didn't say


1555
01:07:27.954 --> 01:07:30.120
that was truly wonderful
to hear.


1556
01:07:32.954 --> 01:07:36.520
And as wonderful
as it is to say, I...


1557
01:07:39.053 --> 01:07:40.920
I don't know
that I'm ready for it.


1558
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.520
Hmm.

1559
01:07:44.653 --> 01:07:46.787
Well...

1560
01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.920
I don't know.

1561
01:07:49.053 --> 01:07:51.954
That kiss the other day
felt pretty ready to me.


1562
01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.120
It's not
that I don't want to try,


1563
01:07:57.253 --> 01:07:58.987
with you.

1564
01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.520
I do.

1565
01:08:01.653 --> 01:08:04.387
I'm just...

1566
01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.553
I'm scared.

1567
01:08:06.687 --> 01:08:08.587
So am I.

1568
01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.653
I am very scared.

1569
01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:13.920
Look.

1570
01:08:15.653 --> 01:08:18.320
Why don't we just take it
one date at a time?


1571
01:08:20.487 --> 01:08:21.754
I could do that.

1572
01:08:21.887 --> 01:08:23.887
So it's a date?

1573
01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.086
It's a date.

1574
01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.653
Hot dang!

1575
01:08:33.887 --> 01:08:35.487
I'm glad you like the flowers.

1576
01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.020
Me too.

1577
01:08:38.153 --> 01:08:39.687
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1578
01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.787
Okay.

1579
01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.120
Tara?

1580
01:08:56.186 --> 01:08:58.186
What is it, sweetheart?
What's the matter?


1581
01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.286
It's from Dad.

1582
01:09:04.587 --> 01:09:06.687
Oh, honey, come here.

1583
01:09:08.587 --> 01:09:11.186
It's gonna be okay.

1584
01:09:20.553 --> 01:09:21.787
Tara, hey.

1585
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.420
You're getting married?

1586
01:09:23.553 --> 01:09:25.653
Yeah. I am.

1587
01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:26.987
Next week.

1588
01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.353
It's-- it's kinda crazy, right?

1589
01:09:28.487 --> 01:09:29.954
This isn't right, James.

1590
01:09:30.086 --> 01:09:31.320
Okay, I know

1591
01:09:31.453 --> 01:09:32.720
you're still mourning
our marriage--


1592
01:09:32.854 --> 01:09:34.553
No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't.
This isn't about us.


1593
01:09:34.687 --> 01:09:35.754
This is about Erin.

1594
01:09:35.887 --> 01:09:36.987
Oh! You--

1595
01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.253
Right.

1596
01:09:38.387 --> 01:09:41.387
Look, I'm sorry to cut
your little visit short,


1597
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.620
but obviously, we're not gonna
get married without her here.


1598
01:09:43.754 --> 01:09:46.220
Did it occur to you,
even for a second,


1599
01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:49.320
that sending your daughter
an e-mail


1600
01:09:49.453 --> 01:09:52.553
with this monumental
piece of news might be...


1601
01:09:52.687 --> 01:09:53.587
insensitive?

1602
01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.086
Oh, come on,
you know kids today.


1603
01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.220
They never answer their phones.

1604
01:09:56.353 --> 01:09:57.820
She's really upset, James.

1605
01:09:57.954 --> 01:09:58.987
She's over-reacting!

1606
01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.320
That's what

1607
01:10:00.453 --> 01:10:01.286
She's 13.

1608
01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.453
Okay, you know what I mean.

1609
01:10:02.587 --> 01:10:04.120
Are you even thinking
about her at all?


1610
01:10:04.253 --> 01:10:06.420
What this means to,
and for, her?


1611
01:10:06.553 --> 01:10:08.553
You should've called her,
talked to her before y--


1612
01:10:08.687 --> 01:10:09.420
Okay, you know what?
We're not--


1613
01:10:09.553 --> 01:10:10.553
We're not doing this, okay?

1614
01:10:10.687 --> 01:10:12.120
I'm not gonna argue
with you about this.


1615
01:10:12.253 --> 01:10:13.286
This is happening, okay?

1616
01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:15.253
So just get her on that plane,
like I asked you.


1617
01:10:15.387 --> 01:10:16.286
My office will send

1618
01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.820
all the info.

1619
01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.587
I can't believe
he's doing this.


1620
01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.653
Sometimes,

1621
01:10:33.787 --> 01:10:35.954
people get caught up
in their own lives


1622
01:10:36.086 --> 01:10:38.987
and they don't think about
how their actions affect others.


1623
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.920
Not "people". Dad.

1624
01:10:42.053 --> 01:10:43.920
I know. He could've
handled this better.


1625
01:10:45.453 --> 01:10:46.920
It's just awful.

1626
01:10:47.053 --> 01:10:49.053
I was hoping...

1627
01:10:50.253 --> 01:10:51.220
Hoping what?

1628
01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.553
That when you came back
to New York,


1629
01:10:54.687 --> 01:10:57.420
Dad would see you and figure
it's really you he loves.


1630
01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:59.587
Oh, Erin, no.

1631
01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.220
Your father and I aren't
getting back together.


1632
01:11:02.353 --> 01:11:03.954
But you love each other.

1633
01:11:04.086 --> 01:11:06.787
We did, but things change
between people,


1634
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.453
and they did
with your father and me.


1635
01:11:09.587 --> 01:11:13.520
But one thing never changed,
and never will...


1636
01:11:13.653 --> 01:11:15.420
we both love you.

1637
01:11:16.787 --> 01:11:18.954
All I want
is for us to be a family.


1638
01:11:19.086 --> 01:11:21.320
I know.
Erin, we are family.


1639
01:11:21.453 --> 01:11:23.553
You and I
will always be family.


1640
01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:25.453
Can't I stay here with you?

1641
01:11:25.587 --> 01:11:27.787
I really love it here.

1642
01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.387
And Bethany doesn't want me!

1643
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.220
Her and Dad will send me
off to boarding school.


1644
01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:32.954
It's not my decision to make.

1645
01:11:33.086 --> 01:11:35.186
I don't want Dad and Bethany
to get married!


1646
01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.120
Bethany couldn't care less
about me.


1647
01:11:37.253 --> 01:11:40.420
To her,
I'm just a complication.


1648
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.420
To all of you!

1649
01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.153
Erin?

1650
01:11:57.954 --> 01:11:59.553
I made you something to eat.

1651
01:12:02.653 --> 01:12:04.120
Erin?

1652
01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:06.286
I'm not hungry!

1653
01:12:07.687 --> 01:12:10.020
Honey, are you okay?

1654
01:12:10.153 --> 01:12:13.020
I'm fine.

1655
01:12:13.153 --> 01:12:15.120
I'll put your plate
in the fridge,


1656
01:12:15.253 --> 01:12:17.286
if you're hungry later.

1657
01:12:40.587 --> 01:12:43.053
Boone. Hi.

1658
01:12:43.186 --> 01:12:45.453
The boys talked me into
making cookies for dessert


1659
01:12:45.587 --> 01:12:48.020
so I thought you and Erin
would like the overflow.


1660
01:12:48.153 --> 01:12:51.120
How, um...
how thoughtful.


1661
01:12:52.153 --> 01:12:54.854
You, uh...
packing up your stuff?


1662
01:13:02.387 --> 01:13:04.653
I am so sorry, but...

1663
01:13:04.787 --> 01:13:06.020
I'm leaving.

1664
01:13:07.587 --> 01:13:09.320
What do you mean, leaving?

1665
01:13:09.453 --> 01:13:11.086
I'm going back to New York.

1666
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.854
When?

1667
01:13:12.987 --> 01:13:14.687
Tomorrow,
if I can get it together.


1668
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.253
Well, when did you decide that?

1669
01:13:16.387 --> 01:13:17.987
I'm still deciding.

1670
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.086
Things are just happening
so fast.


1671
01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.020
Well, what kind of things?

1672
01:13:22.153 --> 01:13:25.420
Erin has to go back to New York
to face some big life changes.


1673
01:13:25.553 --> 01:13:27.520
I don't want her
to deal with them on her own.


1674
01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:28.787
I want to be there for her.

1675
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.653
Were you even gonna bother
telling me?


1676
01:13:30.787 --> 01:13:32.353
Of course,
I was gonna tell you.


1677
01:13:32.487 --> 01:13:34.353
I
-I haven't even told Erin yet.

1678
01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.120
I just decided.

1679
01:13:37.253 --> 01:13:41.086
Like I said, I--
things are happening so fast.


1680
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.286
You said you were scared.
I just...


1681
01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.453
I didn't think
you were this scared.


1682
01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:46.854
This isn't about us, Boone.

1683
01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:50.220
Well, it doesn't look like
there is an "us", does it?


1684
01:13:50.353 --> 01:13:52.520
Don't say that.

1685
01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.320
I gotta get back to the boys.

1686
01:13:55.453 --> 01:13:56.987
I'll-
- I'll see you later.

1687
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.320
Boone, please.
Let's talk about this.


1688
01:14:00.754 --> 01:14:02.253
Boone?

1689
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:33.954
Rise and shine, sweetie!

1690
01:14:34.086 --> 01:14:35.854
Breakfast in 10!

1691
01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.253
Erin?

1692
01:14:53.387 --> 01:14:55.320
-
- Erin, honey?


1693
01:15:05.286 --> 01:15:07.086
Erin?

1694
01:15:10.954 --> 01:15:12.820
Erin?

1695
01:15:15.854 --> 01:15:18.020
Hey. It's Erin.
Leave a message.


1696
01:15:18.153 --> 01:15:21.320
Erin, it's me.
Where are you?


1697
01:15:22.353 --> 01:15:23.954
Call me.

1698
01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.286
- Boone.
- Tara.


1699
01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.320
Morning, Tara.

1700
01:15:28.453 --> 01:15:29.720
Erin's gone.
I think she ran away.


1701
01:15:29.854 --> 01:15:31.153
I looked everywhere,

1702
01:15:31.286 --> 01:15:32.520
and she's not
picking up her phone.


1703
01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:33.954
What makes you think
she ran away?


1704
01:15:34.086 --> 01:15:35.186
The stuff with her dad
last night.


1705
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.320
She was really upset.

1706
01:15:36.453 --> 01:15:37.987
I checked all over
and she's gone.


1707
01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:38.954
Okay, tell you what.

1708
01:15:39.086 --> 01:15:41.053
You drive north,
I'll drive south,


1709
01:15:41.186 --> 01:15:43.053
and we'll see find her, okay?

1710
01:15:43.186 --> 01:15:43.954
- Okay.
- All right.


1711
01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:44.987
You come with me, buddy.

1712
01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.453
Hey, Griff,
have you seen Erin?


1713
01:15:46.587 --> 01:15:47.520
No, why?

1714
01:15:47.653 --> 01:15:48.720
She's missing.

1715
01:15:48.854 --> 01:15:51.186
I was just down at the docks
and the boat's not there.


1716
01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.387
The boat's not there?

1717
01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.120
Yeah, I was gonna go fishing,
but it's gone.


1718
01:15:54.253 --> 01:15:55.787
Does she know how to row?

1719
01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.220
- No!
- Okay, come on! Let's go!


1720
01:16:02.587 --> 01:16:04.353
Erin!

1721
01:16:04.487 --> 01:16:06.186
Erin!

1722
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.520
Erin!

1723
01:16:07.653 --> 01:16:09.687
Erin! Where are you?

1724
01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:10.954
Erin!

1725
01:16:11.086 --> 01:16:12.286
Erin...

1726
01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.286
- Give you a hand.
- Thank you.


1727
01:16:18.754 --> 01:16:20.120
Erin!

1728
01:16:22.186 --> 01:16:23.353
Erin!

1729
01:16:28.587 --> 01:16:29.954
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. whoa.

1730
01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:32.487
There's the boat.

1731
01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:34.653
Tara, take the kids
down that way--


1732
01:16:34.787 --> 01:16:35.854
there's a safer route down.

1733
01:16:35.987 --> 01:16:38.153
I'm gonna go this way.
I'll meet you there, okay?


1734
01:16:50.387 --> 01:16:52.220
Boone?

1735
01:16:54.553 --> 01:16:55.520
Erin.

1736
01:16:57.387 --> 01:16:58.453
Mom!

1737
01:16:58.587 --> 01:17:00.120
There she is!

1738
01:17:01.153 --> 01:17:02.020
Mom!

1739
01:17:02.954 --> 01:17:04.920
Erin! You okay?

1740
01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.253
You okay?

1741
01:17:06.387 --> 01:17:07.453
I think so.

1742
01:17:07.587 --> 01:17:08.687
Okay. I'm gonna
try and get you up.


1743
01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.320
Nice and easy...
there you go. I gotcha.


1744
01:17:10.453 --> 01:17:13.286
Gonna pass you up
to your mother, okay?


1745
01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.487
You got her?

1746
01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.053
Yeah.

1747
01:17:16.186 --> 01:17:18.153
- Mom.
- It's okay. I got you.


1748
01:17:18.286 --> 01:17:20.453
I got you. Okay?

1749
01:17:20.587 --> 01:17:21.954
You all right? Okay.

1750
01:17:28.653 --> 01:17:31.086
Am I gonna get arrested?

1751
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.320
Arrested?

1752
01:17:32.453 --> 01:17:34.186
For stealing the boat.

1753
01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.453
Oh. No. Of course not.

1754
01:17:36.587 --> 01:17:38.520
Oh, I never said
I wasn't gonna arrest her.


1755
01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:41.186
I should arrest you
for being so irresponsible.


1756
01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.820
And what in the world
were you thinking?


1757
01:17:43.954 --> 01:17:45.720
The map on my phone.

1758
01:17:45.854 --> 01:17:48.520
I thought the river
could take me far enough away


1759
01:17:48.653 --> 01:17:50.220
so Dad couldn't find me.

1760
01:17:52.553 --> 01:17:53.787
Please, don't be mad.

1761
01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.587
Oh, baby, I'm not mad.
I'm not mad.


1762
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.687
I'm just so grateful
you're okay.


1763
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.253
I'm so sorry.

1764
01:18:00.387 --> 01:18:01.453
It's okay.

1765
01:18:14.286 --> 01:18:15.987
Boone.

1766
01:18:18.353 --> 01:18:19.520
Thank you.

1767
01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:11.987
Tara.

1768
01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.353
James.

1769
01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:16.120
Are you calling to confirm
Erin's travel arrangements?


1770
01:19:16.253 --> 01:19:18.987
No. I'm calling to let you know
she's staying here with me.


1771
01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.286
At least, for now.

1772
01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.286
What?

1773
01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.086
She was so determined

1774
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.220
not to go back to New York,

1775
01:19:24.353 --> 01:19:25.420
that she ran away this morning.

1776
01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:26.787
She almost drowned.

1777
01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.653
Oh, come on,
you can't be serious.


1778
01:19:28.787 --> 01:19:31.353
Your daughter
is in a world of pain.


1779
01:19:31.487 --> 01:19:33.920
Right now, what she needs
more than anything


1780
01:19:34.053 --> 01:19:35.653
is a parent
who's gonna love her,


1781
01:19:35.787 --> 01:19:36.954
nurture her,

1782
01:19:37.086 --> 01:19:38.120
catch her when she stumbles,

1783
01:19:38.253 --> 01:19:41.320
and try to keep her
from stumbling at all.


1784
01:19:41.453 --> 01:19:43.453
Yeah, well, she's only got
one parent, Tara.


1785
01:19:43.587 --> 01:19:44.954
No. She has me,

1786
01:19:45.086 --> 01:19:46.887
and I'm not sending her
back to you,


1787
01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:47.987
not in the state she's in.

1788
01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120
Yeah, well,
that's not your choice to make.


1789
01:19:49.253 --> 01:19:50.120
You're not her mother.

1790
01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:51.820
Yes, I am...

1791
01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:53.387
in every way that counts.

1792
01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.620
She better be on that plane!

1793
01:19:54.754 --> 01:19:55.754
She won't be.

1794
01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.453
If you want
your daughter back, James,


1795
01:19:59.587 --> 01:20:01.620
learn how to love her.

1796
01:20:01.754 --> 01:20:03.687
She so desperately
wants you to.


1797
01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:04.887
I do love her!

1798
01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:05.987
Of course, I love her.

1799
01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.120
She doesn't know that.

1800
01:20:08.253 --> 01:20:09.220
How could she not?

1801
01:20:09.353 --> 01:20:10.754
I give--
I give her everything she wants.


1802
01:20:10.887 --> 01:20:12.653
Oh, James.

1803
01:20:12.787 --> 01:20:15.653
You're so smart, yet...

1804
01:20:15.787 --> 01:20:17.920
so blind.

1805
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.387
Did she really almost drown?

1806
01:20:21.787 --> 01:20:23.253
Yes.

1807
01:20:23.387 --> 01:20:25.653
That's...

1808
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.387
That's awful. I...

1809
01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:31.520
She needs some time, James.

1810
01:20:32.587 --> 01:20:35.153
And I don't expect you
to come and get her.


1811
01:20:35.286 --> 01:20:41.720
But, for right now,
just let me take care of Erin.


1812
01:20:42.754 --> 01:20:44.353
Please?

1813
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.520
Okay.

1814
01:20:46.653 --> 01:20:47.520
Thank you.

1815
01:20:47.653 --> 01:20:49.553
No. Thank you.

1816
01:20:49.687 --> 01:20:51.120
And hey...

1817
01:20:51.253 --> 01:20:52.854
tell Erin that I love her.

1818
01:20:52.987 --> 01:20:55.720
You can tell her that, James.

1819
01:20:56.954 --> 01:20:59.153
I will.

1820
01:20:59.286 --> 01:21:00.520
Bye.

1821
01:21:15.754 --> 01:21:17.487
- Hey.
- Hi.


1822
01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.720
You're still here.

1823
01:21:21.854 --> 01:21:23.720
I am.

1824
01:21:23.854 --> 01:21:26.253
Uh, forgive the regift.

1825
01:21:28.787 --> 01:21:31.186
I meant what I said, Boone.

1826
01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.887
I'm scared to death

1827
01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.387
to get into
a relationship again,


1828
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.820
but not if it's with you.

1829
01:21:38.353 --> 01:21:42.253
If I let this pass me by,

1830
01:21:42.387 --> 01:21:44.353
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.


1831
01:21:45.987 --> 01:21:49.653
Well, I...
I do appreciate that,


1832
01:21:49.787 --> 01:21:51.620
but it's gonna be
awfully hard to do,


1833
01:21:51.754 --> 01:21:53.120
2,000 miles away.

1834
01:21:55.186 --> 01:21:56.987
I know.

1835
01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.887
A long-distance romance...

1836
01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.720
that's a...

1837
01:22:00.854 --> 01:22:03.253
huge complication.

1838
01:22:03.387 --> 01:22:04.920
It's a...

1839
01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.286
it's a pretty big one.

1840
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.320
Which, um...

1841
01:22:09.387 --> 01:22:10.920
...is why I'm staying.

1842
01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.620
You are?

1843
01:22:13.754 --> 01:22:15.120
I'm taking a job here.

1844
01:22:15.253 --> 01:22:17.220
Um...
I might be teaching your boys.


1845
01:22:17.353 --> 01:22:18.286
Really?

1846
01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.387
They would love that.

1847
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.754
But...

1848
01:22:21.887 --> 01:22:23.120
I mean, what about Erin?

1849
01:22:23.253 --> 01:22:24.453
Doesn't she need you
in New York?


1850
01:22:24.587 --> 01:22:25.587
She's staying, too.

1851
01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.820
Until James comes to his senses

1852
01:22:27.954 --> 01:22:30.420
and becomes the father
that she needs him to be.


1853
01:22:30.553 --> 01:22:31.954
What if that doesn't happen?

1854
01:22:32.086 --> 01:22:33.286
Then I'll be one happy mom.

1855
01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.887
Well, you're a pretty good mom.

1856
01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.687
You're a pretty good dad.

1857
01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.787
Yeah. I try.

1858
01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:41.954
And that's why you are.

1859
01:22:42.086 --> 01:22:44.420
Thank you.

1860
01:22:44.553 --> 01:22:46.487
You've...

1861
01:22:47.553 --> 01:22:50.186
...restored my faith
in so many things.


1862
01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.787
Most importantly...

1863
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.053
in this.

1864
01:22:57.553 --> 01:22:58.553
Game on!

1865
01:23:00.687 --> 01:23:01.754
Where are you going?

1866
01:23:01.887 --> 01:23:03.020
Soccer game?

1867
01:23:03.153 --> 01:23:05.020
Are we gonna do this again?
Really?


1868
01:23:05.153 --> 01:23:06.120
Here we go!

1869
01:23:06.253 --> 01:23:07.420
Remember what happened
last time we did this,


1870
01:23:07.553 --> 01:23:09.186
don't you?

1871
01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.687
Huh?

1872
01:23:11.954 --> 01:23:14.020
Not so fast, cowboy.

1873
