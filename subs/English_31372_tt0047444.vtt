14
00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:36.489
A battle is about to be fought

15
00:01:36.658 --> 00:01:39.058
between the armies of the East
and the West -


16
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.652
For supremacy in medieval Japan

17
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.929
1600 A.D.

18
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.904
Miyamoto Village

19
00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.286
What will you do? Have you decided
about a woman? -Are you going?


20
00:02:46.428 --> 00:02:49.625
I am going

21
00:02:50.432 --> 00:02:52.400
I'll be famous after
my first battle


22
00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:54.967
Then what will the village
elders say!


23
00:02:57.138 --> 00:03:00.904
What do you say?
Join me


24
00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:11.812
Oh yes!
You have your mother to look after


25
00:03:12.754 --> 00:03:15.848
And Otsu to marry

26
00:03:18.293 --> 00:03:21.387
I am all alone. You are not

27
00:03:22.897 --> 00:03:24.728
I will go alone

28
00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.934
Takezo!

29
00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:32.439
Takezo!

30
00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:39.077
Bad one! Climbing trees again!

31
00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:43.916
Takezo!
The priest will scold you!


32
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.252
Really, Takezo!

33
00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:54.587
You too, Matahachi!

34
00:04:09.544 --> 00:04:11.307
Listen, Otsu!

35
00:04:12.814 --> 00:04:17.308
You are engaged to me, aren't you?

36
00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:26.022
If, well, for instance, if...

37
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:29.221
If I left for a year,
what would you do?


38
00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:36.531
Would you wait for me?
-Where are you going?


39
00:04:36.704 --> 00:04:38.797
I am not going anywhere

40
00:04:39.874 --> 00:04:42.035
I mean, "in case"

41
00:04:43.078 --> 00:04:48.983
I would wait. For a year,
even for ten years!


42
00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:50.709
You will?

43
00:04:51.853 --> 00:04:57.689
You are going to battle!
-No. Not l!


44
00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:01.517
You lie!
Takezo has tempted you


45
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:08.731
Do not go, please!
What will become of me?


46
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:15.207
I have tested your love.
-Do not go!


47
00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:20.141
I will never leave you!

48
00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:33.183
Battle of Sekigahara

49
00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:15.929
Look! What's that?

50
00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:20.228
Run for your life! Run!

51
00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:25.005
No use digging!
Run! Quickly!


52
00:07:28.142 --> 00:07:29.473
Unbelievable!

53
00:07:29.844 --> 00:07:33.439
Where are our troops?

54
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.287
Enemy crossed the river!
We've been defeated! Routed!


55
00:07:48.963 --> 00:07:51.898
Can this be the end of the war?

56
00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:56.267
They make us dig like slaves

57
00:07:56.404 --> 00:07:58.998
But the war is lost!

58
00:08:00.508 --> 00:08:03.409
You run!
-And you?


59
00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:07.947
Our cause is not lost.
I will fight on!


60
00:08:14.122 --> 00:08:17.250
Me, too!
-No! Run!


61
00:08:17.392 --> 00:08:21.954
It is not over yet.
I may get a captain's head!


62
00:10:50.912 --> 00:10:55.508
Courage! Matahachi!
Your wound is slight!


63
00:10:55.683 --> 00:10:57.310
I will die!

64
00:10:58.453 --> 00:11:03.117
Don't talk like that.
-I want to live to see her!


65
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:05.420
Courage!

66
00:11:07.361 --> 00:11:11.457
I see a house!

67
00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:16.100
I can't quite make it out.
Keep your strength up


68
00:11:18.439 --> 00:11:20.304
Otsu is an orphan

69
00:11:20.741 --> 00:11:24.905
After I am gone,
please look after her


70
00:11:31.252 --> 00:11:35.621
Spare no one!
Search everywhere!


71
00:11:56.644 --> 00:11:58.839
Look! Matahachi!
The house!


72
00:11:59.013 --> 00:12:02.414
I can't go on.
-lt is true! Look!


73
00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:51.496
Mother!

74
00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:02.742
Give us food!

75
00:13:03.678 --> 00:13:05.111
And keep quiet!

76
00:13:53.494 --> 00:13:56.327
You must be hungry.
Sorry I am late


77
00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:12.811
Thank you. I will eat later

78
00:14:13.447 --> 00:14:18.248
I'm tired of eating gruel.
-The wound is healing fast


79
00:14:19.153 --> 00:14:21.485
It has been two months already

80
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:28.187
Where is he?
-Riding again. He likes to


81
00:14:28.362 --> 00:14:32.924
It's not just that.
He's trying to conquer the horse


82
00:14:33.067 --> 00:14:35.262
He rides until he exhausts it

83
00:14:36.337 --> 00:14:41.934
He has always been ruthless.
-I like that type of man!


84
00:14:52.086 --> 00:14:56.989
How I long for home!
But this must mend itself first


85
00:14:57.158 --> 00:15:00.286
The skin has not healed over

86
00:15:01.162 --> 00:15:05.064
I can walk, though.
-Do not overexert yourself


87
00:15:05.232 --> 00:15:10.465
We cannot stay here forever.
-But we are glad to have you


88
00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:15.541
You see, we are alone.
It is lonely here


89
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:21.510
Stay until you recover.
-The enemy might discover us


90
00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:26.416
They do not look for such
unimportant... Pardon me!


91
00:15:27.555 --> 00:15:31.321
Unimportant. That's right!

92
00:15:31.492 --> 00:15:33.255
Let me do it

93
00:15:38.632 --> 00:15:42.500
We left home thinking we could
become samurai so easily


94
00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:47.171
What a dream!

95
00:15:48.275 --> 00:15:52.006
Bear it, weakling!

96
00:16:51.038 --> 00:16:54.030
Takezo!
Give me a ride!


97
00:17:02.016 --> 00:17:04.041
Otsu, my love!

98
00:17:05.486 --> 00:17:07.283
Forgive me!

99
00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:15.724
Who is this Otsu?
-A girl of our village


100
00:17:15.863 --> 00:17:20.266
Your sweetheart?
-No, Matahachi's betrothed


101
00:17:20.434 --> 00:17:24.097
Matahachi's?
-A nice, sweet girl


102
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:26.865
And she excelled a rough riding

103
00:17:27.308 --> 00:17:31.677
You think I'll be frightened?
-You will if I let him out!


104
00:17:31.846 --> 00:17:34.781
I will not! Try him!

105
00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:38.146
You'll scream.
Your mother will be angry


106
00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:42.255
Do not worry!
I will not scream. Please!


107
00:17:42.423 --> 00:17:45.290
Stubborn!
-Coward!


108
00:17:45.426 --> 00:17:48.190
Coward?
-You big coward!


109
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.270
Do not cry out!

110
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.887
Are you all right?

111
00:18:22.897 --> 00:18:25.525
That crazy mean horse!

112
00:18:25.699 --> 00:18:30.432
It is not his fault.
-You think it's mine?


113
00:18:30.571 --> 00:18:32.232
Do not be angry

114
00:18:51.292 --> 00:18:55.661
Why don't you hold me
in your arms?


115
00:18:57.665 --> 00:18:59.257
Women!

116
00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:24.051
Wench! Listen!

117
00:19:32.166 --> 00:19:34.100
Is your mother home?

118
00:19:37.905 --> 00:19:41.500
Warn her!
Tell her she's trespassing!


119
00:19:41.675 --> 00:19:46.578
We will collect our share of
the tribute soon! Remember!


120
00:19:46.714 --> 00:19:51.981
I will run you two out of this
territory unless you behave!


121
00:20:03.797 --> 00:20:05.196
Who's that?

122
00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:07.165
A brigand

123
00:20:22.082 --> 00:20:26.485
Hurry! He will be back again!

124
00:20:30.457 --> 00:20:33.824
Say! This is splendid!

125
00:20:39.266 --> 00:20:41.131
What is your trade?

126
00:20:42.436 --> 00:20:45.564
Outwardly, herb-farming

127
00:20:45.739 --> 00:20:50.142
And actually?
-Actually?


128
00:20:51.712 --> 00:20:55.478
Connected with brigands?
-To some extent


129
00:20:55.682 --> 00:20:59.049
Mother! This is solid gold!

130
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.788
It is. Splendid!

131
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:11.259
Stripping dead samurai?
-Y es. Otherwise we cannot live


132
00:21:11.432 --> 00:21:14.299
Not scared?
-So what?


133
00:21:14.468 --> 00:21:18.029
You also?
-Of course. They are dead!


134
00:21:27.748 --> 00:21:30.683
Will that brigand really come?

135
00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:35.181
Is your mother not frightened?

136
00:21:36.323 --> 00:21:38.382
Is the hiding-place far?

137
00:21:40.094 --> 00:21:42.085
Please speak to me

138
00:21:44.765 --> 00:21:46.756
Do not be angry with me

139
00:21:47.101 --> 00:21:50.935
Forget it!
You have Otsu!


140
00:22:01.949 --> 00:22:04.440
He has no right to stop me

141
00:22:04.618 --> 00:22:07.348
I can do whatever I like!

142
00:22:08.255 --> 00:22:10.587
He killed my husband

143
00:22:11.725 --> 00:22:16.856
People say so.
But I hate to believe it


144
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.433
My man was a bigger man.
Stronger and finer


145
00:22:21.568 --> 00:22:23.900
Though he too was a brigand

146
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.537
Drink?
-I cannot


147
00:22:32.846 --> 00:22:35.872
Give me that wooden sword!

148
00:22:36.617 --> 00:22:38.983
You are a child

149
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.818
I will not be here long

150
00:22:45.959 --> 00:22:50.055
I will go to Kyoto
for some real business


151
00:22:50.197 --> 00:22:52.495
What about you?

152
00:22:52.966 --> 00:22:57.994
I cannot go home yet.
-Waiting for another battle?


153
00:22:58.138 --> 00:23:01.835
First fame, then I shall
return home


154
00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:05.539
Parents?
-No


155
00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:07.909
Relatives?
-Yes


156
00:23:08.048 --> 00:23:11.347
I am wild, so they hate me

157
00:23:11.485 --> 00:23:13.851
Lonely?
-No!


158
00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:19.759
Good fortune to you!

159
00:23:28.168 --> 00:23:31.399
Already!
-The bandit!


160
00:23:31.538 --> 00:23:34.268
Good! I shall test this.
-Wait!


161
00:24:04.204 --> 00:24:07.332
Are you alone?
Where's the wench?


162
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:15.644
Bring out the treasure quietly,
quick! Or you'll regret it!


163
00:24:19.786 --> 00:24:23.813
Stubborn one!
-Let us search!


164
00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:37.660
The ceiling!

165
00:25:10.537 --> 00:25:11.970
Who are you?

166
00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:14.566
Kill him!

167
00:27:34.247 --> 00:27:38.513
I will never let you go!
-What are you doing?
Never!


168
00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.448
A woman is drawn to a strong man!

169
00:27:42.589 --> 00:27:45.080
You make me feel like a woman!

170
00:27:45.659 --> 00:27:48.628
Take me, Takezo!

171
00:27:49.629 --> 00:27:52.530
I love you!

172
00:27:52.666 --> 00:27:57.763
A woman says this,
only when she loves!


173
00:28:00.073 --> 00:28:02.701
Take me!

174
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.996
Who was that running passed us?

175
00:28:53.093 --> 00:28:56.290
Must we leave at once?
-Yes!


176
00:28:56.429 --> 00:28:58.397
We have to get out before dawn

177
00:28:58.532 --> 00:29:01.763
His bandits are bound
to come to kill us!


178
00:29:01.935 --> 00:29:03.835
We'll fight

179
00:29:04.571 --> 00:29:07.665
We'll wait for Takezo, won't we?

180
00:29:07.807 --> 00:29:09.536
He won't come back!

181
00:29:10.644 --> 00:29:12.009
Why?

182
00:29:13.346 --> 00:29:17.680
He attempted to assault me.
He is a savage!


183
00:29:19.819 --> 00:29:22.515
I repulsed him. He ran away

184
00:29:23.957 --> 00:29:30.658
You're gentle and kind, Matahachi,
not like that wild boar!


185
00:29:30.797 --> 00:29:36.030
Please help us. Will you?
Will you help us?


186
00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.989
Takezo!

187
00:31:05.191 --> 00:31:08.649
That fool!
What about your mother and Otsu?


188
00:31:36.623 --> 00:31:38.989
You fool, Matahachi!

189
00:31:42.862 --> 00:31:45.194
You fool, Matahachi!

190
00:31:58.878 --> 00:32:02.041
Give them our gold!

191
00:32:02.182 --> 00:32:05.549
Never!
-Our lives...


192
00:32:06.486 --> 00:32:09.887
Do not touch the women!
We can talk!


193
00:32:47.894 --> 00:32:49.361
Matahachi!

194
00:32:49.529 --> 00:32:52.623
You are brave!

195
00:33:08.848 --> 00:33:14.514
"All travelers must show
proper identification"


196
00:33:16.589 --> 00:33:21.390
What is your destination?
-Miyamoto Village


197
00:33:21.528 --> 00:33:23.189
He looks like a bandit

198
00:33:23.363 --> 00:33:24.591
Seize him!

199
00:34:08.141 --> 00:34:12.202
Priest Takuan! 
Look at yourself!

200
00:34:14.881 --> 00:34:18.339
"Holy I am alone..."

201
00:34:23.022 --> 00:34:26.583
Drink, my newborn Buddha!

202
00:34:26.759 --> 00:34:29.284
Find me a drying pole instead

203
00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:32.887
I washed my only clothes

204
00:34:33.066 --> 00:34:35.227
What will you do in the meantime?

205
00:34:35.401 --> 00:34:38.063
I shall stay like this

206
00:34:38.872 --> 00:34:42.569
Please! It is unbecoming!
-What do you mean?


207
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:49.307
Human beings are born naked.
-Oh! You priests!


208
00:35:19.012 --> 00:35:20.411
Mother Osugi!

209
00:35:21.648 --> 00:35:23.707
Otsu! My dear!
-What is happening?


210
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:28.549
I hear Takezo broke through the
guard and is in this area


211
00:35:28.688 --> 00:35:31.179
We may hear about Matahachi!

212
00:35:33.726 --> 00:35:36.854
So you are Takezo's relatives?

213
00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:43.232
We are quite distant relatives, sir

214
00:35:43.403 --> 00:35:47.669
And we have nothing to do with him

215
00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.276
He was such an unmanageable fellow

216
00:35:51.411 --> 00:35:55.643
We outlawed him.
We call him "The Lawless"


217
00:35:55.815 --> 00:35:57.749
Very well. Now listen!

218
00:35:59.185 --> 00:36:03.986
I am organizing a hunt for him,
with my base at this temple


219
00:36:04.123 --> 00:36:07.149
All of you will cooperate
and assist us!


220
00:36:08.962 --> 00:36:14.696
That "Lawless" Takezo is a terror

221
00:36:14.834 --> 00:36:17.302
He let my son die alone
and he shamelessly came home


222
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.267
We must punish him!

223
00:36:38.758 --> 00:36:40.749
Matahachi, where are you?

224
00:37:16.696 --> 00:37:19.893
How criminal!
Bloodshed in a temple!


225
00:37:20.066 --> 00:37:22.534
What audacity to come here!

226
00:37:22.668 --> 00:37:26.104
He is a demon!
A devil, indeed!


227
00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:33.975
The village will be penalized
for this! Understand?


228
00:37:34.614 --> 00:37:40.814
Two from each family shall
report at once for the hunt!


229
00:37:40.953 --> 00:37:42.648
That is an order!

230
00:37:48.494 --> 00:37:53.022
Hurry up!

231
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:22.460
Now arrest all villagers
related to him!


232
00:38:22.628 --> 00:38:24.823
They will be the bait!

233
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:30.588
Come on! You lazy louts!
Are you dead?


234
00:39:30.763 --> 00:39:32.355
Hurry up! Hurry up!

235
00:40:11.604 --> 00:40:13.765
Thank you for your work

236
00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:25.083
Should Matahachi be dead,
what will you do?


237
00:40:25.318 --> 00:40:28.879
I will still consider you
as my daughter-in-law


238
00:40:29.021 --> 00:40:31.148
You are, aren't you?

239
00:40:31.991 --> 00:40:33.959
Aren't you?

240
00:40:35.194 --> 00:40:37.424
I am relieved to hear that

241
00:40:44.837 --> 00:40:49.638
It would not be proper to
leave you at the temple too long


242
00:40:49.775 --> 00:40:52.300
You will live here with me!

243
00:40:55.248 --> 00:40:57.614
Or don't you like that idea?

244
00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.679
You should like it

245
00:41:04.223 --> 00:41:08.319
I shall teach you to sew and weave

246
00:41:08.461 --> 00:41:10.520
Mother Osugi!

247
00:41:18.304 --> 00:41:19.498
Takezo!

248
00:41:30.583 --> 00:41:33.074
Listen!
Matahachi is not dead!


249
00:41:35.021 --> 00:41:38.320
I came to tell you that!
He's not dead!


250
00:41:38.491 --> 00:41:40.925
Where is he?
-I do not know!


251
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.858
But he is alive!
-What is he doing?


252
00:41:44.764 --> 00:41:46.197
I cannot...

253
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:52.567
tell you that!
Do not ask me!


254
00:41:52.738 --> 00:41:54.228
Takezo!

255
00:41:55.207 --> 00:41:57.107
Where are you going?

256
00:41:58.277 --> 00:42:00.245
I hate this village

257
00:42:00.379 --> 00:42:03.576
I came to tell you of your son!

258
00:42:04.784 --> 00:42:09.983
I am glad.
But you mustn't leave so quickly


259
00:42:10.956 --> 00:42:13.481
Aren't you hungry?

260
00:42:13.893 --> 00:42:16.384
I have not eaten for days!

261
00:42:16.562 --> 00:42:21.124
Poor Takezo!
I will get you something


262
00:42:21.267 --> 00:42:23.565
No guard will ever look here

263
00:42:24.103 --> 00:42:26.628
Take a bath, too!

264
00:42:28.708 --> 00:42:30.300
Yes!

265
00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:46.019
This is wonderful,
so calm, so nice


266
00:42:48.327 --> 00:42:51.956
I thought Mother Osugi
would be bitter


267
00:42:55.568 --> 00:42:57.195
I am!

268
00:42:59.638 --> 00:43:05.235
You did not bring him back to me!

269
00:43:06.178 --> 00:43:07.702
Why?

270
00:43:09.248 --> 00:43:12.547
I'm sorry. I could not

271
00:43:12.718 --> 00:43:16.051
But why will you not
tell me the reason?


272
00:43:16.222 --> 00:43:17.587
What is he doing?

273
00:43:17.723 --> 00:43:19.748
I cannot tell you that

274
00:43:36.175 --> 00:43:39.008
Mother Osugi!
-Quiet!


275
00:44:14.647 --> 00:44:15.978
A trap!

276
00:44:28.661 --> 00:44:30.822
Osugi! Traitress!

277
00:44:32.665 --> 00:44:36.032
I came to comfort you.
And you betrayed me!


278
00:44:43.476 --> 00:44:46.172
Matahachi deserted me!

279
00:44:46.345 --> 00:44:49.314
He is weak!
A coward!


280
00:45:24.917 --> 00:45:29.047
Reinforcements arrived
from the castle today


281
00:45:29.321 --> 00:45:33.690
The roadways and hills
are covered by guards


282
00:45:33.859 --> 00:45:36.259
He is trapped

283
00:45:36.428 --> 00:45:42.697
Villagers shall continue
the hunt day and night!


284
00:45:50.042 --> 00:45:54.035
Hurry up!

285
00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:46.127
Otsu! A letter

286
00:46:58.243 --> 00:46:59.642
What happened?

287
00:47:34.213 --> 00:47:36.272
From Matahachi, and one Oko!

288
00:47:36.415 --> 00:47:39.009
Matahachi has been my lover
since the great battle


289
00:47:39.184 --> 00:47:42.085
We have since married

290
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:46.658
I learned of his betrothal to you
as he spoke in his sleep


291
00:47:46.825 --> 00:47:50.591
You must not wait for him

292
00:47:50.763 --> 00:47:54.130
Your heart must not cry

293
00:48:16.689 --> 00:48:20.921
You are out to capture me too?
-No, you are mistaken! Spare me!


294
00:48:38.077 --> 00:48:41.012
It's terrible! 
Come, somebody!

295
00:48:41.413 --> 00:48:43.506
Takezo did this!

296
00:49:06.772 --> 00:49:09.639
I'm going into the mountains

297
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:16.104
This is idiotic
just to catch a man


298
00:49:16.281 --> 00:49:19.808
The villagers are frightened.
-You... alone?


299
00:49:21.019 --> 00:49:24.614
So many men have already
failed to catch him


300
00:49:25.591 --> 00:49:30.221
Takezo is a man, with a
man's weaknesses. -No


301
00:49:30.362 --> 00:49:34.389
Wait and see. I shall
bring him back in due time


302
00:49:40.572 --> 00:49:41.766
Priest!

303
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:45.838
I'll go with you!

304
00:50:39.765 --> 00:50:42.563
That is why you came with me

305
00:50:42.734 --> 00:50:47.364
You wanted to hear more
about Matahachi


306
00:50:50.075 --> 00:50:53.408
He was unfaithful. Forget him!

307
00:50:54.179 --> 00:50:57.239
I am glad for you, you are young

308
00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:00.748
I cannot think that way

309
00:51:00.919 --> 00:51:04.320
What troubles you?
-I am confused!


310
00:51:05.591 --> 00:51:07.149
My heart is broken!

311
00:51:08.026 --> 00:51:12.520
Forgive me. I did not mean
to make you cry


312
00:51:13.966 --> 00:51:18.801
Otsu! Play the bamboo flute.
It heals sorrow


313
00:51:20.505 --> 00:51:24.100
Meanwhile the food
will get warm


314
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:45.916
Good evening. Is it not
cold and damp out there?


315
00:52:46.058 --> 00:52:47.992
Come nearer the fire

316
00:52:49.962 --> 00:52:53.420
Priest! Talking to yourself?

317
00:52:53.565 --> 00:52:58.332
Not at all, look
out there in the reeds


318
00:53:00.038 --> 00:53:01.232
Wait!

319
00:53:03.842 --> 00:53:07.676
Come here.
We will not harm you


320
00:53:08.113 --> 00:53:11.844
Here is fire and food
to warm yourself


321
00:53:12.484 --> 00:53:16.420
We're not your enemies.
No, not at all


322
00:53:16.822 --> 00:53:19.484
Let us talk by the fire

323
00:53:32.437 --> 00:53:35.338
Here. Come over here

324
00:54:27.926 --> 00:54:29.518
It is good?

325
00:54:36.768 --> 00:54:39.737
Why are you here?
-To capture you


326
00:54:45.243 --> 00:54:50.681
If you will surrender
to a Buddhist priest...


327
00:54:50.816 --> 00:54:54.582
consideration shall be given you.
-Never!


328
00:54:54.753 --> 00:54:59.383
My boy! Do you think you can win?
-Yes!


329
00:55:00.992 --> 00:55:04.621
Trying to defeat yourself, also?

330
00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:08.027
I do not mind dying
in a good fight!


331
00:55:08.166 --> 00:55:12.626
But before I die,
I will have some blood!


332
00:55:12.938 --> 00:55:17.773
What about your relatives?
They are prisoners on your account


333
00:55:17.909 --> 00:55:22.812
Who are they? Who are they?

334
00:55:22.981 --> 00:55:26.382
Some are suffering.
-Hang them all!


335
00:55:26.518 --> 00:55:29.544
Better dead! All of them!

336
00:55:29.688 --> 00:55:33.146
Even the women?
-Quiet!


337
00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:40.595
Their children?
-I don't care. Let all of them...


338
00:55:45.604 --> 00:55:46.798
Fool!

339
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.440
Wild fool!

340
00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:56.046
I punish you, with the hand
of your parents!


341
00:56:05.724 --> 00:56:08.386
Takezo has been captured!

342
00:56:11.429 --> 00:56:12.953
Takezo's captured!

343
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:49.660
I did not capture him
for the reward


344
00:56:50.602 --> 00:56:54.231
You say you will not
deliver him to me?


345
00:56:54.372 --> 00:56:59.071
If you refuse to leave him to me,
I shall free him!


346
00:56:59.644 --> 00:57:03.205
Then recapture him yourself.
-What do you mean?


347
00:57:03.381 --> 00:57:05.975
Do you want to kill me?
Good


348
00:57:06.117 --> 00:57:10.486
Deliver my head to Himeji Castle,
to Lord lkeda


349
00:57:10.655 --> 00:57:15.388
He would probably say "Good priest
Takuan, where is the rest of you?"


350
00:57:16.828 --> 00:57:19.626
Is my Lord your friend?

351
00:57:19.798 --> 00:57:24.167
Take my head and find out.
Cut it off clean


352
00:57:28.106 --> 00:57:31.269
I beg you a thousand pardons,
Your Grace!


353
00:57:31.443 --> 00:57:36.506
But what about Takezo? Will you
let me handle him my way?


354
00:57:36.648 --> 00:57:41.210
Yes. If you'll give me
his head later


355
00:57:41.353 --> 00:57:44.550
Good, Aoki.
Funerals are my job


356
00:57:44.689 --> 00:57:47.351
I would have no work if
you got the corpses also!


357
00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.999
Takuan!

358
00:58:01.039 --> 00:58:05.703
What is it?
-I have something to tell you!


359
00:58:05.844 --> 00:58:07.072
Come closer

360
00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:21.352
Here I am!
What do you want?


361
00:58:22.594 --> 00:58:24.994
Why don't you behead me?

362
00:58:26.431 --> 00:58:31.232
You shame me this way!
And you call yourself a priest!


363
00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:36.131
Do you not know how to treat
a samurai? Idiot!


364
00:58:36.675 --> 00:58:38.700
You're a spirited one!

365
00:58:40.712 --> 00:58:47.845
Lout!
I could have crushed you!


366
00:58:47.986 --> 00:58:50.921
Too bad you didn't!

367
00:58:51.089 --> 00:58:55.651
I surrendered believing you were
a man of high virtue


368
00:58:55.827 --> 00:59:00.821
A true sign of stupidity!
-I did nothing


369
00:59:00.999 --> 00:59:04.435
I am not ashamed.
I am a samurai!


370
00:59:04.602 --> 00:59:07.799
Are you? Samurai!

371
00:59:07.972 --> 00:59:11.669
With your spirit you
won't die for some time


372
00:59:13.845 --> 00:59:17.975
Priest! You trash!

373
00:59:18.149 --> 00:59:22.279
Please! Why be so cruel...
he is helpless!


374
00:59:22.554 --> 00:59:25.523
It is not your concern.
-Y es, it is!


375
00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:28.887
I helped capture him!

376
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:33.224
No! I insist that I have
my way in this!


377
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.938
I cannot believe this!

378
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:52.941
It is incredible!

379
01:00:00.792 --> 01:00:04.853
Oh, but that I had
great strength!


380
01:00:24.048 --> 01:00:25.743
Takezo!

381
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.960
Maybe he is dead!
-He's still alive!


382
01:00:45.136 --> 01:00:46.831
Let's stone him and see!

383
01:00:48.339 --> 01:00:51.775
Children! Go home!

384
01:01:03.721 --> 01:01:06.781
Whether he is dead or alive...

385
01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:11.224
you are my daughter-in-law!

386
01:01:11.362 --> 01:01:12.954
Understand?

387
01:01:14.399 --> 01:01:18.233
I would rather die!

388
01:01:18.403 --> 01:01:24.205
Fool! I'm telling you to leave
the temple and join my house!


389
01:01:25.343 --> 01:01:28.904
But to me that will mean
only death! -Why?


390
01:01:29.714 --> 01:01:34.413
A house without love
is a living death


391
01:01:34.552 --> 01:01:38.215
Quiet!
How dare you say that?


392
01:01:38.356 --> 01:01:41.484
You are a mere child!

393
01:01:41.626 --> 01:01:43.821
Ungrateful young wench!

394
01:01:58.076 --> 01:01:59.668
Priest!

395
01:02:01.646 --> 01:02:04.911
Priest! Please!

396
01:02:05.049 --> 01:02:08.485
Are you still there?
Come inside! It is cold


397
01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:12.283
Have mercy on him.
Please cut him down!


398
01:02:12.423 --> 01:02:14.323
No! Impossible!

399
01:02:15.226 --> 01:02:19.788
I am begging you!
He will die!


400
01:02:19.964 --> 01:02:24.560
No!
-Please! For mercy's sake!


401
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:31.308
I promise to do anything!
Only forgive him


402
01:02:31.442 --> 01:02:32.875
It is justice!

403
01:02:34.078 --> 01:02:36.342
You are merciless!

404
01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:39.016
A devil!

405
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:40.947
A demon!

406
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:12.948
Takezo!

407
01:03:14.852 --> 01:03:16.319
Takezo!

408
01:03:21.092 --> 01:03:23.822
What do you want, trash?

409
01:03:24.796 --> 01:03:27.424
You still have your tongue, I see!

410
01:03:27.565 --> 01:03:30.830
Maybe you will live!
-Shut up!


411
01:03:31.603 --> 01:03:33.434
Behead me!

412
01:03:34.372 --> 01:03:36.465
It is dangerous

413
01:03:36.641 --> 01:03:41.237
Even after death, your head
would jump at me


414
01:03:42.747 --> 01:03:45.238
Is the moon not beautiful tonight?

415
01:03:57.729 --> 01:04:01.563
Poor fellow. At last
he's lost his reason


416
01:04:01.699 --> 01:04:05.829
Silence! My body will
kill you when I fall!


417
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:08.097
That's the spirit, my boy!

418
01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:19.845
Easy now!
Such a futile struggle


419
01:04:20.785 --> 01:04:26.155
Could you but use that
force for humanity's good!


420
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:32.729
God and man would be moved.
Nay, even the universe!


421
01:04:37.635 --> 01:04:41.435
A man must know awe, and fear God

422
01:04:41.572 --> 01:04:46.703
Conceited in your strength,
you ignored wisdom and virtue


423
01:04:46.844 --> 01:04:49.836
You thought you could
defeat the world


424
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:51.676
Look at yourself!

425
01:04:57.255 --> 01:05:01.248
Wisdom and strong virtues
combined, make a man


426
01:05:02.827 --> 01:05:04.727
Understand?

427
01:05:08.266 --> 01:05:11.133
Think it over till dawn

428
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:13.396
I shall behead you then

429
01:05:14.639 --> 01:05:19.838
Wait!
Good priest, is it true?


430
01:05:24.682 --> 01:05:30.211
I am truly a man!
Do not let me die like an animal!


431
01:05:30.388 --> 01:05:32.083
Spare my life!

432
01:05:35.259 --> 01:05:40.253
I want to live!
God help me live!


433
01:05:43.334 --> 01:05:45.768
Well said!

434
01:05:45.937 --> 01:05:49.873
But, life is like a real battle

435
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:52.601
There's no return match

436
01:05:52.744 --> 01:05:57.841
Prepare for death,
recite the Sutras of Buddha!


437
01:06:45.329 --> 01:06:46.455
Otsu!

438
01:07:27.338 --> 01:07:30.671
Why?
-Do not ask me!


439
01:07:31.909 --> 01:07:35.777
Let us run. They will
kill us at first sight!


440
01:08:53.257 --> 01:08:57.284
Otsu! Is this a dream?
Am I alive?


441
01:09:04.702 --> 01:09:06.192
I am so hungry

442
01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:13.174
I have rice-cakes in
my parcel, Takezo!


443
01:09:14.211 --> 01:09:21.140
But I cannot open it. My hands!
I'm sorry, will you open it?


444
01:09:33.431 --> 01:09:36.525
Otsu! Thank you!

445
01:09:42.606 --> 01:09:44.096
It is all right

446
01:09:45.376 --> 01:09:49.506
I am such a fool!

447
01:09:49.914 --> 01:09:54.078
I apologize!
I apologize!


448
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:17.131
As I was gazing at you,
bound and hanging


449
01:10:17.608 --> 01:10:21.908
I saw that I too was bound
by an unseen rope


450
01:10:22.747 --> 01:10:27.582
And I could not cut
the rope by myself


451
01:10:30.488 --> 01:10:35.016
Takezo! I cannot go back!

452
01:10:35.159 --> 01:10:38.128
Take me with you!

453
01:10:38.295 --> 01:10:40.058
Do you hate me?

454
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.324
Once

455
01:10:46.203 --> 01:10:47.761
But now...

456
01:10:53.177 --> 01:10:55.805
And l...
-Please!


457
01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:01.745
What would I do
if you discarded me?


458
01:11:02.219 --> 01:11:06.019
I am alone.
All alone in this world!


459
01:11:09.326 --> 01:11:11.317
I, too

460
01:11:12.496 --> 01:11:16.557
Then you must know how I feel!

461
01:11:28.946 --> 01:11:32.040
But I have no power
to make you happy


462
01:11:33.017 --> 01:11:37.579
Takezo! Both of us are lonely

463
01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:48.721
Look! Takezo!

464
01:12:18.429 --> 01:12:21.262
Capture them!

465
01:12:24.268 --> 01:12:28.602
Fire a signal!
Use the gun and powder!


466
01:12:46.123 --> 01:12:49.217
Leave me here! 
You run alone!

467
01:12:49.393 --> 01:12:51.361
I cannot!

468
01:12:59.703 --> 01:13:02.069
Wait for me here!

469
01:13:04.975 --> 01:13:06.670
Understand? Wait here!

470
01:13:39.109 --> 01:13:40.599
Takezo!

471
01:14:03.968 --> 01:14:05.595
Takezo!

472
01:14:18.215 --> 01:14:22.777
Himeji Castle

473
01:14:23.387 --> 01:14:28.051
Mother Osugi! Mother Osugi!
-What is it?


474
01:14:28.192 --> 01:14:30.592
Otsu's been taken to the castle!

475
01:14:31.328 --> 01:14:33.421
Takezo escaped capture!

476
01:14:36.267 --> 01:14:38.701
Quiet, everybody!

477
01:14:45.209 --> 01:14:48.178
Old one!
Prepare for a trip!


478
01:14:49.113 --> 01:14:51.980
To defend the prestige of my name!

479
01:14:52.883 --> 01:14:55.579
We will kill Otsu and Takezo!

480
01:15:12.002 --> 01:15:17.235
Listen! You shall have
the first cut at Takezo!


481
01:15:17.408 --> 01:15:22.277
Me... the first cut?
-Yes. And I will do the beheading!


482
01:15:23.514 --> 01:15:27.848
Watch your step!
-Silence, fool!


483
01:15:28.018 --> 01:15:32.318
Watch it yourself.
You are no goat!


484
01:16:07.758 --> 01:16:09.055
Takezo!

485
01:16:11.628 --> 01:16:14.495
Are you still an animal?

486
01:16:14.665 --> 01:16:19.898
Otsu rescued me.
I must get her out!


487
01:16:20.637 --> 01:16:24.004
Fool! She is safe

488
01:16:24.575 --> 01:16:26.372
Follow me

489
01:17:28.739 --> 01:17:32.197
Priest Takuan! 
Priest Takuan!

490
01:17:32.342 --> 01:17:37.177
She is safely sheltered near
the bridge of Hanada


491
01:17:37.347 --> 01:17:39.713
You dirty lying rogue!

492
01:17:49.026 --> 01:17:53.019
Open here! Open the door!

493
01:17:53.163 --> 01:17:59.102
Takezo! This room is yours
for some time


494
01:17:59.269 --> 01:18:03.205
Otsu will wait!

495
01:18:03.373 --> 01:18:06.035
You lie! She is alone!

496
01:18:06.176 --> 01:18:12.479
She will wait! In those books
are many of the things you need!


497
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:15.209
Master them, and retrospect!

498
01:18:15.352 --> 01:18:17.582
I leave you, wild fool!

499
01:18:28.499 --> 01:18:31.093
Bridge of Hanada

500
01:18:31.235 --> 01:18:32.930
It may be years!

501
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:35.061
You will be waiting faithfully?

502
01:18:35.806 --> 01:18:37.831
Remember this

503
01:18:38.141 --> 01:18:40.905
As you know

504
01:18:41.078 --> 01:18:45.208
a priest has little
understanding of love matters


505
01:18:45.349 --> 01:18:46.475
Farewell

506
01:19:15.913 --> 01:19:20.782
Kyoto

507
01:20:22.913 --> 01:20:26.178
That is not the song of a child!

508
01:20:26.316 --> 01:20:29.808
When did she learn it?

509
01:20:29.953 --> 01:20:33.218
Probably in secret for tonight

510
01:20:33.357 --> 01:20:34.619
You are in love

511
01:20:37.361 --> 01:20:40.353
Akemi, how old are you?

512
01:20:40.497 --> 01:20:46.299
Guess how old I am.
-Sixteen? No, seventeen!


513
01:20:47.771 --> 01:20:51.138
Was I mistaken?
-She is already twenty-one


514
01:20:51.308 --> 01:20:55.074
Amazing!
She looks so young!


515
01:20:55.212 --> 01:20:58.010
Is it true?
I am happy


516
01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:03.547
I wish I could be sixteen forever.
-Why?


517
01:21:04.688 --> 01:21:08.749
Something wonderful took place.
-What was it?


518
01:21:09.192 --> 01:21:11.854
It was the year of the Great Battle

519
01:21:11.995 --> 01:21:15.487
I was sixteen, then.
-Y es, and?


520
01:21:16.733 --> 01:21:21.033
Akemi! Do not talk of old wars

521
01:21:21.171 --> 01:21:25.039
You see, those days bring
ugly memories to me


522
01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:27.676
But probably not to a child

523
01:21:29.312 --> 01:21:34.716
By the way, let us attend
the Kabuki Theatre!


524
01:21:34.885 --> 01:21:39.720
Y es let's. All of us! Eh, Akemi?
-Wonderful! Let us change!


525
01:21:39.856 --> 01:21:44.054
You go as you are.
Excuse me a moment


526
01:21:46.063 --> 01:21:50.261
Fetch the sedan chairs

527
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.530
I will go.
-You remain here with Seijuro


528
01:22:01.144 --> 01:22:03.738
Akemi, finish that story

529
01:22:05.382 --> 01:22:08.647
It is a secret.
-About a man?


530
01:22:14.558 --> 01:22:18.619
We will offer Seijuro
Akemi in return for wealth!


531
01:22:20.297 --> 01:22:25.132
She would displease him!
-Jealous? Ambitious?


532
01:22:25.302 --> 01:22:27.065
In truth...
-I am


533
01:22:28.939 --> 01:22:33.376
If he accepts Akemi, we
can live in luxury together!


534
01:22:57.701 --> 01:22:59.134
Where are you going?

535
01:23:06.676 --> 01:23:09.907
How long must you flatter
that young fool?


536
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.980
I know my own business

537
01:23:13.183 --> 01:23:15.310
You would even sell
your own daughter!


538
01:23:17.888 --> 01:23:19.879
You are a strange woman

539
01:23:22.893 --> 01:23:25.657
You have destroyed my life

540
01:23:25.796 --> 01:23:27.627
What kind of a man are you?

541
01:23:29.866 --> 01:23:35.429
I wish I had not rejected Takezo
that night. He is a man!


542
01:23:36.473 --> 01:23:40.603
I am your husband!
-An idiot, you mean!


543
01:23:42.946 --> 01:23:46.973
Order the sedan chairs.
Four of them!


544
01:24:08.104 --> 01:24:09.628
Otsu!

545
01:24:16.246 --> 01:24:19.181
Three years have passed.

546
01:24:19.282 --> 01:24:24.413
Priest Takuan, realizing that Takezo
ia a man of exceptional qualities,


547
01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:29.618
has intervened on his behalf. Takezo
has begun his moral training...


548
01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.328
in preparation for service
in the cause of Himeji Castle.


549
01:25:34.791 --> 01:25:39.057
We will give him a title
appropriate for a samurai


550
01:25:39.195 --> 01:25:41.493
Miyamoto Musashi!

551
01:25:44.167 --> 01:25:46.032
Musashi, it is good

552
01:25:46.169 --> 01:25:50.538
You do not wish to be
in my service? Why?


553
01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:53.832
I am far from ready, sir

554
01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:57.275
Then you shall travel
and train yourself!


555
01:25:57.447 --> 01:25:59.005
Yes, my Lord

556
01:26:01.985 --> 01:26:05.113
I pray for him, my Lord!

557
01:26:06.957 --> 01:26:09.482
What thorough protection!

558
01:26:22.806 --> 01:26:27.175
The world is vast and boundless.
Be staunch!


559
01:26:36.786 --> 01:26:38.083
What happened?

560
01:26:43.126 --> 01:26:48.996
May I bid Otsu goodbye?
-The parting will be sad, my friend


561
01:26:49.165 --> 01:26:51.156
I must tell her I am leaving

562
01:26:51.301 --> 01:26:53.496
I will tell her for you.
-But


563
01:26:53.636 --> 01:26:56.867
No!
-She is my life!


564
01:26:57.007 --> 01:26:59.134
So you must see her?

565
01:27:00.777 --> 01:27:04.577
Takezo! Is that the only reason?

566
01:27:05.715 --> 01:27:07.706
If so, I will not stop you

567
01:27:08.318 --> 01:27:12.277
But you must have another. Yes?

568
01:27:15.358 --> 01:27:19.590
Takezo! Cut off the past!

569
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:24.098
You are a new man.
Reborn as it were


570
01:27:25.101 --> 01:27:27.797
Break clean from the past!

571
01:28:41.311 --> 01:28:45.338
Thank you very much.
Please come again


572
01:29:00.897 --> 01:29:02.524
Welcome

573
01:29:12.142 --> 01:29:13.632
Takezo!

574
01:29:19.849 --> 01:29:23.615
I have waited!
It was too difficult


575
01:29:27.023 --> 01:29:30.754
Otsu! Give me up for dead!

576
01:29:31.728 --> 01:29:33.389
I cannot!

577
01:29:34.464 --> 01:29:38.457
It is our fortune!

578
01:29:41.404 --> 01:29:46.103
Then, for what have I waited
these three years?


579
01:29:46.876 --> 01:29:51.745
You told me we two would help
each other to new life!


580
01:29:52.649 --> 01:29:56.449
Was that a lie? A whim?

581
01:29:57.353 --> 01:29:59.048
Forgive me

582
01:30:00.156 --> 01:30:01.817
No, no!

583
01:30:05.562 --> 01:30:08.258
It is cruel of Priest Takuan, too!

584
01:30:09.332 --> 01:30:11.163
Please, Takezo!

585
01:30:12.902 --> 01:30:16.565
Take me with you wherever you go

586
01:30:17.207 --> 01:30:20.142
I am to travel for training

587
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:22.942
But why can't I be with you?

588
01:30:23.546 --> 01:30:28.483
Have I displeased you, Takezo?
-No


589
01:30:28.618 --> 01:30:30.415
I love you, Otsu!

590
01:30:31.788 --> 01:30:36.225
I constantly thought of you in the
castle. -Then, why?


591
01:30:36.593 --> 01:30:40.962
If you care for me, do not follow

592
01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:44.622
I will follow even beyond
the Great Seas


593
01:30:46.269 --> 01:30:48.635
Take me with you

594
01:30:49.405 --> 01:30:51.805
I will not hinder you

595
01:30:59.749 --> 01:31:03.651
Take me!
If I annoy you...


596
01:31:03.786 --> 01:31:08.018
Ieave me in a wilderness,
or anywhere you like!


597
01:31:09.158 --> 01:31:12.059
I shall be obedient

598
01:31:12.595 --> 01:31:15.189
But take me with you!

599
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.566
Oh God! Wait here my love,
I shall prepare myself


600
01:31:31.381 --> 01:31:33.076
Wait!

601
01:32:51.027 --> 01:32:54.121
Soon I will be back

602
01:33:06.175 --> 01:33:11.636
FORGlVE ME

603
01:33:26.696 --> 01:33:31.395
THE END
