1
00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:19.210
- Hello.
- Well, Philip Calvert.


2
00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:22.046
You look well. 
How was Malta?

3
00:05:22.338 --> 00:05:25.090
A bloody sight warmer than here.
How are you?


4
00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:28.761
You look smart.
Good clothing allowance in Intelligence.


5
00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:31.346
We get an allowance
for pens and paper clips.


6
00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.600
Ah, danger lurks
behind every filing cabinet.


7
00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:36.810
How's it feel to be at Headquarters?

8
00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:40.940
The Mediterranean fleet
will be floundering. Why am I here?


9
00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:44.318
- All right, sir.
- That was my idea, actually.


10
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.195
We've got this sort of problem, you see,

11
00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:51.909
and you being so clever with nautical
things, underwater and all that.


12
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:54.953
- You mean if it's wet, I'm your man.
- SO to speak.


13
00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:59.041
So am I going to be the world's
first underwater spy?


14
00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:03.378
That's funny. I like that. No.
It's about these ships. Bullion vessels.


15
00:06:03.671 --> 00:06:07.174
Hijacked off the face of the earth
or rather the high seas.


16
00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.719
- Who by? Human exiles?
- Philip, please.


17
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:13.347
It is, as they say,
a matter of national importance.


18
00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.850
I doubt the nation gives a damn.
It's not their gold.


19
00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:21.021
The same story each time. Crews
put ashore in some place in Ireland


20
00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:24.817
then released, by which time
the ships are taken to God knows where.


21
00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:28.779
What are we supposed to do
to save the nation for democracy?


22
00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:30.947
Between the two of us, Philip -

23
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.868
with my organisational genius
and your physical talents -


24
00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:38.956
we must evolve a master plan
to take before the chief.


25
00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:44.666
- Which is whom?
- Sir Arthur Arnford-Jones KCB etcetera.


26
00:06:46.047 --> 00:06:49.884
Yes. Quite an impressive record...
I suppose.


27
00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:54.180
I see that like all men employed
in highly-specialised branches,


28
00:06:54.472 --> 00:06:57.433
you have a questionable attitude
towards authority.


29
00:06:57.725 --> 00:06:59.977
I don't know that I care for that.

30
00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:04.314
It says here,
"Unsuitable for routine investigation.


31
00:07:04.607 --> 00:07:07.318
"Operates best under extreme pressure.

32
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.110
"At this level, he's unique.”
Do you suppose that's true?


33
00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:17.828
- It must be if it's on the file.
- I'm not happy about this...


34
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.456
Yes. Do sit down.
I'm not happy about this, Calvert.


35
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:26.086
I should have preferred my own men
with the assistance of Lord Charnley


36
00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.214
and Lloyds, of course.

37
00:07:28.506 --> 00:07:30.758
I have everybody breathing down my neck.

38
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.595
The Admiralty, the government,
the Americans


39
00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.722
and the insurance assessors -

40
00:07:37.014 --> 00:07:40.600
grubby little men with gabardine
raincoats and dandruff.


41
00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:43.145
I don't have dandruff, sir.

42
00:07:43.437 --> 00:07:47.774
You don't need to demonstrate
your questionable attitude to authority


43
00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:49.276
quite so early.

44
00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.071
Well, what have you and Mr er...

45
00:07:52.947 --> 00:07:55.741
- Hunslett, sir.
- Hunslett.


46
00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:57.534
Hunslett.

47
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:00.579
What have you come up with?

48
00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:03.290
Right. It's this.

49
00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:08.083
Let's conceal two men with
a transmitter on the next bullion ship,


50
00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:11.048
so if she's hijacked
we'll know where she is.


51
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.010
The men can send signals at
prearranged times and frequencies


52
00:08:15.303 --> 00:08:16.846
and we can take bearings.

53
00:08:17.138 --> 00:08:21.638
It may be that Mr Hunslett and myself
could then shadow the ship.


54
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.439
Could men be concealed like that?
It seems rather far-fetched.


55
00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:30.860
I don't like it. It's too dangerous.
Too many ifs and buts.


56
00:08:31.152 --> 00:08:34.238
With all due respect,
you haven't had an if or a but.


57
00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:38.242
The next ship is the Nanceville.

58
00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:41.203
Eight million quids' worth of gold bullion.

59
00:08:41.495 --> 00:08:43.330
Surely that's worth a risk or two?

60
00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:46.000
- 1 insist on using my own men.
- OK.


61
00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:50.045
I met them. They should be able
to take care of themselves.


62
00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:54.467
They're excellent men.
They can certainly look after themselves.


63
00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:57.303
- Show them in, Mr...
- Hunslett.


64
00:09:02.224 --> 00:09:04.226
Come in, gentlemen.

65
00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:57.446
- Henry! Up here, quickly.
- Voltec. You go round the back.


66
00:09:57.738 --> 00:09:59.865
Come on!

67
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:49.123
Pick him up.

68
00:11:06.557 --> 00:11:08.767
How did it go?

69
00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:10.977
Not good.

70
00:11:12.897 --> 00:11:16.358
- Let's get out of this arm our.
- What was not good about it?


71
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.445
- Too strong an opposition.
- They were good men.


72
00:11:20.738 --> 00:11:23.907
- The enemy were better.
- Uncle Arthur won't like this.


73
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.244
- Do you think I like it?
- SO much for our plan.


74
00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:31.665
They were able to transmit
and we were able to follow.


75
00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:36.457
It was all justified -
if you discount loss of life, that is.


76
00:11:37.004 --> 00:11:40.924
- Do you?
- No, I don't. That's the trouble.


77
00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:44.678
Here. I made something to drink.

78
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.470
- You've been having a hard night.
- I'm Intelligence, aren't 1?


79
00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:54.020
I have to stay in and think
while you go out and implement.


80
00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:56.690
I get half strangled and kicked to death

81
00:11:56.982 --> 00:12:00.402
while you sit here making... bloody cocoa.

82
00:12:00.694 --> 00:12:02.529
It's what I do well.

83
00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.740
Let's have some whisky.

84
00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:08.118
You'd better bandage my leg.

85
00:12:09.537 --> 00:12:12.706
We don't want blood
all over the floor, do we?


86
00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.624
- DO you want some?
- No.


87
00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:18.670
The Nanceville will be halfway
to God knows where by now.


88
00:12:18.963 --> 00:12:22.549
Yes, I know. But they did come here
in the first place,


89
00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:26.095
SO we could assume
that the area's significant


90
00:12:26.387 --> 00:12:29.139
and they could have people in the area.

91
00:12:29.431 --> 00:12:31.349
And we're new arrivals in Torbay.

92
00:12:31.642 --> 00:12:36.063
God Almighty! You're hurting me
more than that bastard on the ship.


93
00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:40.233
Sorry. We didn't learn first aid
in Intelligence.


94
00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:43.487
- Is that tight enough? OK?
- Yeah.


95
00:12:45.322 --> 00:12:46.781
Thanks.

96
00:12:47.908 --> 00:12:49.618
What time is it?

97
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.746
6:25. We have
to radio Uncle Arthur at eight.


98
00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:54.998
He does get to work early.

99
00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:59.294
- Good morning, Sir.
- Any news from Buttercup?


100
00:12:59.587 --> 00:13:01.714
- Buttercup?
- Daisy.


101
00:13:02.006 --> 00:13:05.134
Oh, you mean Caroline, sir. 
Any moment now.

102
00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:40.248
'This is Annabel calling Caroline.
use the scrambler procedure.'


103
00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:44.840
Good morning. This is Caroline.
May I speak to Annabel?


104
00:13:45.132 --> 00:13:47.759
Good morning, Caroline. 
This is Annabel.

105
00:13:48.052 --> 00:13:50.846
Location 481.281.

106
00:13:51.138 --> 00:13:54.141
'West of Scotland.
A place called Loch Huron.'


107
00:13:58.896 --> 00:14:01.940
I have you.
Have you located the missing vessel?


108
00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:04.234
- 'I have.'
- Where is it?


109
00:14:04.526 --> 00:14:08.863
Where was it, you mean.
Could be a hundred miles away by now.


110
00:14:09.156 --> 00:14:13.034
Different colours, different markings,
different flags.


111
00:14:13.327 --> 00:14:15.329
"What about our friends? "

112
00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:21.501
They won't be coming home.
I've been aboard but I was expected.


113
00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:24.087
'I warned you about this, Caroline.'

114
00:14:33.097 --> 00:14:34.807
Phil! Someone's coming.

115
00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:38.602
- 'You've messed up the whole thing.'
- Must pack up.


116
00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:43.394
Any usefulness or effectiveness
you might have had has been dissipated.


117
00:14:44.274 --> 00:14:45.650
Can't talk now.

118
00:14:45.943 --> 00:14:49.029
We've lost two friends.
We've lost the vessel.


119
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:52.490
- We've lost the secrecy.
- We've lost him, sir.


120
00:14:52.783 --> 00:14:55.952
Calvert? Calvert!

121
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.957
Hurry!

122
00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:19.184
Morning, gentlemen.
Have you brought the milk?


123
00:15:19.476 --> 00:15:23.188
Morning. I'm Sergeant MacDonald
from Torbay police station.


124
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.980
- These gentlemen are Customs officials.
- Are they? That's an interesting life.


125
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.781
- Is this your boat, sir?
- Yes, it is. Or rather it's my employer's.


126
00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:35.867
- And who is that?
- The government.


127
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.621
- The government?
- Yes. Didn't you see the flag?


128
00:15:39.913 --> 00:15:43.416
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
Marine biologists.


129
00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:47.963
We're a kind of floating laboratory.
All sorts of odd specimens.


130
00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:52.217
We're looking for chemicals that were
stolen from Ayrshire last night.


131
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:55.053
Apparently they came north by sea.

132
00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:59.098
This is the third port we've checked
and the 13th boat.


133
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.226
Just routine, you see.

134
00:16:01.518 --> 00:16:03.353
You must be exhausted.

135
00:16:03.645 --> 00:16:07.649
Why don't you come below -
my friend makes very good cocoa.


136
00:16:10.194 --> 00:16:11.904
- Cheers.
- Thank you.


137
00:16:12.196 --> 00:16:14.865
- Might I photocopy these?
- Sure.


138
00:16:15.157 --> 00:16:18.618
- Yes, I have a portable photocopier.
- OK.


139
00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:23.749
- You're welcome to look around.
- I don't think that's necessary.


140
00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:26.501
I'd like to see the engine rooms.

141
00:16:26.794 --> 00:16:31.215
Perhaps Mr Hunslett will show
the Sergeant the living quarters?


142
00:16:33.217 --> 00:16:35.594
This way.

143
00:16:43.644 --> 00:16:47.314
You carry a lot of batteries.
Why all the power?


144
00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:51.568
We've got eight electric motors
in the lab for when we're in harbour


145
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.360
which means we can't use the engines
to supply the juice for them.


146
00:16:56.865 --> 00:17:01.365
Then there's the central heating,
hot water and the electric winches.


147
00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:05.999
And, of course, my electric toothbrush.

148
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:10.211
Yes, of course.
Boats aren't really my line.


149
00:17:15.259 --> 00:17:19.054
The law were genuine. You can't
imitate coppers as good as that.


150
00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:22.307
The Customs weren't.
They said they'd been on 13 boats.


151
00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:25.059
They look like they've come
from the cleaners.


152
00:17:25.352 --> 00:17:29.606
One said, "Boats aren't my line."
What sort of remark is that?


153
00:17:29.898 --> 00:17:32.442
It's like Uncle Arthur
saying he's never heard of cricket.


154
00:17:32.734 --> 00:17:36.946
I'll tell you something else.
They didn't have a photocopier.


155
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.120
Ah. No respect for other people's property.

156
00:17:46.415 --> 00:17:49.835
There's blood all over it.
He must have hurt himself.


157
00:17:50.127 --> 00:17:53.255
That's why he didn't take his gloves off.
He hurt his hand.


158
00:17:53.547 --> 00:17:56.049
- Did he?
- Yes. I shoved a knife through it.


159
00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.301
Last night on the Nanceville.

160
00:17:58.594 --> 00:18:00.095
- Did you?
- 'Yes.


161
00:18:10.439 --> 00:18:12.441
- See you later.
- OK.


162
00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:31.126
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


163
00:18:31.418 --> 00:18:34.796
You've no' brought
very nice weather with you.


164
00:18:35.088 --> 00:18:37.381
May I use your phone? 
Long distance.

165
00:18:37.674 --> 00:18:41.386
- None of the phones are working.
- Where's the nearest phone?


166
00:18:41.678 --> 00:18:44.222
The mainland. But the boat's sailed.

167
00:18:44.514 --> 00:18:46.933
It won't be back for four days.

168
00:18:47.809 --> 00:18:52.309
Well, I'd better stock up on
some tobacco. Could be a long winter.


169
00:19:31.478 --> 00:19:35.565
You'll not find many marine specimens
up here, Mr Calvert.


170
00:19:35.857 --> 00:19:38.484
Just getting some exercise, Sergeant.

171
00:19:39.653 --> 00:19:42.697
Cooped up on that boat,
I just want to stretch my legs.


172
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.992
It's a long stretch from Torbay.

173
00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:47.369
Good for one, though. 
Wonderful air.

174
00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:50.955
Pity about those wires.
Didn't know it was stormy last night.


175
00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:54.209
Surely you felt it if
you were in that boat?


176
00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:59.001
- By the way, our radio was smashed.
- Was it? So was the Shangri-la.


177
00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:02.634
- We'll be looking into it.
- That is reassuring.


178
00:20:02.926 --> 00:20:06.137
- Who's on the Shangri-la?
- Sir Anthony Skouras.


179
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.724
Skouras the shipping man? 
Big oily Cypriot?

180
00:20:10.017 --> 00:20:13.520
SIR Anthony. There's not
a kinder man sailed into Torbay.


181
00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:15.980
No of fence. Good old Skouras.

182
00:20:16.273 --> 00:20:20.773
You'd be as well not to offend his name,
especially in front of me.


183
00:20:21.528 --> 00:20:23.863
I lost two sons tragically last year

184
00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:27.617
and Sir Anthony was most kind to us
in our time of grief.


185
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:29.827
Good day to you.

186
00:22:09.469 --> 00:22:13.514
That's for openers! 
We'll be watching you.

187
00:22:14.683 --> 00:22:16.810
I hope you learn something!

188
00:22:32.325 --> 00:22:34.535
Haven't I found out some things!

189
00:22:34.828 --> 00:22:37.789
How long have you been in the pub?

190
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:41.584
I had to. I needed a few whiskies
to get the locals to loosen up.


191
00:22:41.877 --> 00:22:43.295
I'll claim expenses.

192
00:22:43.587 --> 00:22:47.757
Not full of Scottish hospitality, are they?
What did you find out?


193
00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:50.760
Firstly, it's an accident-prone area.

194
00:22:51.052 --> 00:22:54.889
Disasters at sea, deaths,
disappearances - boats, yachts.


195
00:22:55.182 --> 00:22:57.642
Exactly when, I wonder. What else?

196
00:22:57.934 --> 00:23:01.646
A lot of personal tragedy ashore too.
You know who that boat belongs to?


197
00:23:01.938 --> 00:23:03.648
- Skouras. I know.
- Oh.


198
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.026
What have you discovered?
Why are you so messy?


199
00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:11.323
I bumped into this wild gypsy girl
in the heather, that's all.


200
00:23:21.416 --> 00:23:23.418
Phil, look.

201
00:23:25.712 --> 00:23:28.214
<i>-What are they signaling?
-um...</i>


202
00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:30.884
They didn't teach us that in Intelligence.

203
00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:33.636
Let's see...

204
00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:36.306
What's the message?

205
00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:39.100
Message reads...

206
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.894
drinks at ten o'clock.

207
00:23:43.563 --> 00:23:45.565
That's fine. Thank you.

208
00:23:56.076 --> 00:24:00.038
- It's like Sotheby's afloat.
- How do people get this rich?


209
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.583
Maybe they hijack bullion ships.

210
00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:06.043
We're on the wrong side, aren't we?

211
00:24:06.336 --> 00:24:10.173
There's only one side to be on -
the winning one.


212
00:24:14.177 --> 00:24:17.346
My apologies, gentlemen. My apologies.

213
00:24:17.639 --> 00:24:20.600
We were combining business with dinner,

214
00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:24.812
which is not only impolite
but bad for the digestion.


215
00:24:25.105 --> 00:24:27.398
- I'm Philip Calvert.
- How do you do?


216
00:24:27.691 --> 00:24:30.777
- This is my friend Roy Hunslett.
- How do you do?


217
00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:34.614
We thought it was time
to meet our new neighbours.


218
00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:39.368
May I introduce Mr Lavorski, 
Mr Macullum...

219
00:24:39.661 --> 00:24:41.996
Oh, and Lady Skouras.

220
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:45.166
I should have
introduced you first, darling.


221
00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:47.376
You should have

222
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:49.295
but you rarely do.

223
00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:51.756
- Charlotte.
- Lady Skouras.


224
00:24:52.048 --> 00:24:54.258
Charlotte.

225
00:24:54.551 --> 00:24:56.469
- How do you do?
- How do you do?


226
00:24:56.761 --> 00:25:01.261
Ahem. Would you chaps
prefer to stay with whisky


227
00:25:02.684 --> 00:25:04.769
or would you like a brandy?

228
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:06.937
We'll stick to whisky, thank you.

229
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.150
We've dined on my friend's
beans on toast and frozen beefburgers.


230
00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:14.154
The brandy wouldn't stand a chance.

231
00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:18.366
I'll stick to whisky too.
But out of chauvinism.


232
00:25:20.201 --> 00:25:24.701
How do you like this part of the world?
Is it wet enough for you?


233
00:25:26.041 --> 00:25:30.541
Well, we're working,
so it doesn't very much matter.


234
00:25:32.005 --> 00:25:36.505
- They're marine biologists.
- Word gets round very quickly.


235
00:25:36.843 --> 00:25:40.263
Sir Anthony knows everything
that goes on in Torbay.


236
00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:43.349
He's been cruising here
for several seasons.


237
00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:47.646
The South of France and the Aegean
can't hold a candle to these waters.


238
00:25:47.937 --> 00:25:49.229
That's true.

239
00:25:49.522 --> 00:25:53.859
Who wants to cruise around the
Greek Isles in all that boring sunshine


240
00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:57.655
when you can have a month
of freezing wind and rain up here?


241
00:25:57.947 --> 00:26:02.326
Charlotte's idea of yachting
is an expensive floating wardrobe


242
00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:04.829
permanently moored to a quay.

243
00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:08.332
- Preferably on the CN te d'Azur.
- Preferably.


244
00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:13.125
With a lot of bronzed young men
flexing their hairdos.


245
00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:18.505
Excuse the bitching. We're having
one of our generation gap evenings.


246
00:26:19.427 --> 00:26:22.721
Come along, Charlotte.
It's only a few weeks a year.


247
00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:27.184
- You know how Anthony loves it here.
- He does too.


248
00:26:27.477 --> 00:26:31.977
Sir Anthony has done many fine
and charitable things in this area.


249
00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.733
Yes. So I hear.

250
00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:38.863
Good works and public services
are very easy for the rich.


251
00:26:39.155 --> 00:26:41.991
- As easy as signing a cheque.
- Charlotte.


252
00:26:44.619 --> 00:26:48.331
- I think that's rather unfair.
- Fetch me that picture.


253
00:26:52.794 --> 00:26:54.587
Please.

254
00:27:00.802 --> 00:27:04.430
You see, gentlemen,
despite Charlotte's cynicism,


255
00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:08.268
my motives were completely genuine.

256
00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:11.437
My wife...

257
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:16.230
um, that is, my first wife, Anna.

258
00:27:17.694 --> 00:27:22.194
My wife and I grew attached to this
part of Scotland on our honeymoon


259
00:27:23.783 --> 00:27:25.576
many years ago.

260
00:27:25.869 --> 00:27:30.081
And it's never easy to sign a cheque,
Mr Calvert.


261
00:27:31.249 --> 00:27:33.584
Especially when you're rich.

262
00:27:33.877 --> 00:27:36.629
It's always good to see
how the other half sail.


263
00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:40.007
It's nice to see the other half
seeing the other half.


264
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.429
Perhaps we should drink
to those in peril on the sea.


265
00:27:44.721 --> 00:27:48.641
- Are we in peril?
- There's always peril in these waters.


266
00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:50.643
Cheers.

267
00:27:56.566 --> 00:27:58.150
Good health.

268
00:27:59.652 --> 00:28:01.654
Good wealth.

269
00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:07.952
Calling Caroline. Caroline.
This is Station SFPX.


270
00:28:08.244 --> 00:28:11.288
Repeat, SFPX. Are you receiving me?

271
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:13.916
Repeat. Are you receiving me? Over.

272
00:28:17.545 --> 00:28:19.922
You should have radioed uncle Arthur.

273
00:28:20.215 --> 00:28:24.715
The wait won't hurt him. He can have
another bottle of port at the club.


274
00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:27.763
- Is that rope tight?
- I think so.


275
00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:29.974
I'm not awfully good at knots.

276
00:28:30.266 --> 00:28:33.769
I know, they didn't teach you that
at Intelligence.


277
00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:37.356
Bloody fellow.
North of England grammar school.


278
00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:40.818
"Working his way
through the ranks of life" type.


279
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.696
- No background.
- Perhaps something's gone wrong.


280
00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:48.158
We needn't have rushed dinner.
I hate rushing dinner.


281
00:28:48.451 --> 00:28:50.286
Maybe he's in some danger.

282
00:28:50.578 --> 00:28:52.997
I might have tried some of that Stilton.

283
00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:55.624
Mind you, you never know... What?

284
00:28:55.917 --> 00:28:58.127
I said he may be in some danger.

285
00:28:58.419 --> 00:29:02.423
- Got hurt or something.
- Let's hope it's nothing trivial.


286
00:29:13.726 --> 00:29:17.563
Now we know why scruffs like us
were asked over for drinks.


287
00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:19.774
Better get on the blower.

288
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.818
Excuse me, sir. 
Caroline calling.

289
00:29:23.111 --> 00:29:25.279
It never stops. Come on.

290
00:29:26.447 --> 00:29:29.158
There's a boat here
with a definite connection.


291
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:33.370
They had their transmitter smashed too
but that could be a cover.


292
00:29:33.663 --> 00:29:37.792
They had us over for drinks.
Anyway, they searched the Fire crest.


293
00:29:38.084 --> 00:29:41.962
Strange setup. A husband and wife
who can't stand each other


294
00:29:42.255 --> 00:29:44.423
and a man who presides over them.

295
00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:48.803
'The husband's name is Skouras.
Sir Anthony Skouras.'


296
00:29:49.095 --> 00:29:51.472
Don't you know who he is?

297
00:29:51.764 --> 00:29:55.100
- 'A man with his record..."
- All right, all right.


298
00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:57.061
It's not all right.

299
00:29:57.353 --> 00:30:00.064
He's a distinguished member of my own club.

300
00:30:00.356 --> 00:30:02.524
He's on the wine committee!

301
00:30:02.817 --> 00:30:07.317
With all due respect, Annabel, sir,
there's no need to go into cardiac arrest


302
00:30:08.364 --> 00:30:12.701
because I don't share your faith
in the probity of your fellow members.


303
00:30:12.994 --> 00:30:14.996
That'll be quite enough of that.

304
00:30:15.288 --> 00:30:19.788
Report here at noon tomorrow.
A helicopter will pick you up at five.


305
00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:22.461
Sir, let me stay on
until I can at least...

306
00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:24.172
I think not, Buttercup.

307
00:30:24.464 --> 00:30:28.176
The sooner you stop chasing
red herrings, the better for all of us.


308
00:30:28.468 --> 00:30:30.887
At least check some facts for me.

309
00:30:31.179 --> 00:30:33.306
- Very well, if they're valid.
- Here.


310
00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:36.892
Hopeless fellow.
Comes of not going to a proper school.


311
00:30:37.185 --> 00:30:41.314
Where's the paper? You do it.
Carry on, Caroline.


312
00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.441
Oh. Caroline.

313
00:30:43.733 --> 00:30:45.693
Fire ahead.

314
00:31:03.544 --> 00:31:07.506
- No second thoughts?
- No. It's worth a chance.


315
00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:09.634
All I've got to lose is my job.

316
00:31:09.926 --> 00:31:13.429
I hope that's all you lose,
you mad bastard. Cheers.


317
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:09.985
- Morning.
- Lieutenant Williams. You Calvert?


318
00:32:10.278 --> 00:32:13.197
- Commander Calvert.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Sir.


319
00:32:13.489 --> 00:32:17.989
That's all right. I'm pulling rank
because I'm changing your orders.


320
00:32:18.286 --> 00:32:20.413
- You know this area well?
- Very well.


321
00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:23.791
- But I'm meant to take you to London.
- Sir.


322
00:32:24.083 --> 00:32:25.250
Yes, sir.

323
00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:30.043
We'll go to London some other time.
I take full responsibility. OK?


324
00:32:30.506 --> 00:32:32.341
OK, sir. I mean - yes, Sir.

325
00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:34.217
Good.

326
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.680
- Have a cigarette. Forget about the sirs.
- Thanks.


327
00:32:38.973 --> 00:32:41.308
I need an excuse to search the area.

328
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:44.520
Can you put out a false Mayday
on your radio?


329
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.982
- I want the BBC to pick it up.
- You're kidding?


330
00:32:49.275 --> 00:32:52.194
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir. It can be done, sir.


331
00:33:23.059 --> 00:33:26.812
...could the quality of
the Clyde shipyards be maintained.


332
00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:30.191
'A boat is in trouble
near the island of Skye.


333
00:33:30.483 --> 00:33:34.195
'A distress signal was picked up
this morning from the TSDY Moray Rose,


334
00:33:34.487 --> 00:33:37.823
'reported not under command
and making water fast.


335
00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:40.701
'Air sea rescue services
have been alerted.'


336
00:33:40.993 --> 00:33:42.703
Let's go.

337
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:12.024
I'm looking for a hide-out.
Probably a boat as well.


338
00:34:13.276 --> 00:34:17.071
A motor launch or something.
Might be a big boathouse.


339
00:34:17.363 --> 00:34:19.948
Might even be a tiny harbour.

340
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:22.993
Somewhere between Is lay and Skye.

341
00:34:23.286 --> 00:34:27.786
Can't be more than 1,000 miles
of coastline. What do we do after lunch?


342
00:34:34.297 --> 00:34:37.133
- Let's have a look at that over there.
- OK.


343
00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:10.457
OK.

344
00:35:30.519 --> 00:35:32.896
Royal Navy helicopter.

345
00:35:33.189 --> 00:35:36.609
That helicopter's not spying.
It's Air Sea Rescue.


346
00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.445
I heard something about a missing boat.

347
00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:42.239
Perhaps he'll rescue me from this monotony.

348
00:35:42.531 --> 00:35:47.031
I could suggest many ways you could
rescue yourself from this monotony.


349
00:35:47.328 --> 00:35:49.288
Shut up! Both of you.

350
00:36:30.913 --> 00:36:32.915
Craigmuir Harbour.

351
00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:36.209
- Are they whale hunters?
- Sharks.


352
00:36:36.502 --> 00:36:40.339
For the liver oil. I've been there once.
I'd vouch for them.


353
00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:43.050
Boss goes by the name of Tim Hutchinson.

354
00:36:51.434 --> 00:36:53.477
Let's go and say hello.

355
00:37:23.632 --> 00:37:25.884
- Are you Hutchinson?
- Aye.


356
00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:28.596
My name's Calvert, 
Air Sea Rescue.

357
00:37:29.722 --> 00:37:31.932
Any of you lads want to be rescued?

358
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.895
No. I don't think
anyone wants to be rescued, thank you.


359
00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:40.566
- Even from that smell?
- What smell?


360
00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.193
Listen, can you help me?

361
00:37:43.486 --> 00:37:47.948
Have you seen any strange boats
in the area over the last few months?


362
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.075
Half hidden or moored?

363
00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:54.372
- No, but we'll keep our eyes open.
- Thanks.


364
00:37:54.663 --> 00:37:57.374
- Any news of Calvert?
- I'm afraid not, sir.


365
00:37:57.666 --> 00:37:59.793
What's happened to the bloody fellow?

366
00:38:00.086 --> 00:38:03.214
All I Know is we haven't heard
from the helicopter.


367
00:38:03.506 --> 00:38:06.217
- Haven't you any proper biscuits?
- Pardon, sir?


368
00:38:06.509 --> 00:38:10.679
Proper biscuits with cream inside.
Never mind.


369
00:38:10.971 --> 00:38:14.432
- What's this?
- The information you asked for, sir.


370
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:38.499
Look at this place.
It's called Baile nan Ui.


371
00:38:38.791 --> 00:38:39.917
What?

372
00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:44.338
Baile nan Ui. It's Gaelic.
It means the "mouth of the grave".


373
00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.365
Loch Huron.

374
00:39:11.657 --> 00:39:16.157
That castle there is called Du Skea.
Home of Lord Kirkside.


375
00:40:00.206 --> 00:40:02.208
Be back in a minute.

376
00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:13.468
- Have you got engine failure?
- Air Sea Rescue, Miss... er?


377
00:40:13.761 --> 00:40:16.180
This isn't sea, this is private land.

378
00:40:16.472 --> 00:40:20.972
Why are the natives so hostile?
I only want to ask a few questions.


379
00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:25.272
- Where's your old man?
- I assume you mean Lord Kirkside?


380
00:40:25.564 --> 00:40:28.692
If you're the daughter, yes.
Where's your old man?


381
00:40:28.984 --> 00:40:31.987
The old man's over here. Kirkside.

382
00:40:33.155 --> 00:40:37.200
Calvert. There's a boat
called the Moray Rose...


383
00:40:37.493 --> 00:40:41.747
I heard the news.
There's no sign of her round here.


384
00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:46.334
No flares. I took a look round
the cliffs myself this morning.


385
00:40:46.627 --> 00:40:49.504
- OK. Sorry about dropping in.
- YOU see...


386
00:40:49.797 --> 00:40:54.297
My son and Sue's fiancé... they
disappeared recently in a flying accident.


387
00:40:55.761 --> 00:40:59.264
There's been a lot of press men
always dropping in.


388
00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.684
I understand. Sorry.

389
00:41:07.982 --> 00:41:09.942
We're running out of daylight.

390
00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:13.445
Fly over the northern end
of the island and then home.


391
00:41:43.517 --> 00:41:46.937
It's getting a bit dark.
The ground should be soggy.


392
00:41:47.229 --> 00:41:49.648
So I'll hover, you jump, Sir.

393
00:41:56.864 --> 00:41:58.866
Keep down.

394
00:42:21.221 --> 00:42:23.431
- My God, you move fast.
- Yeah...


395
00:45:02.007 --> 00:45:05.260
He won't be coming up now. Let's go.

396
00:45:35.624 --> 00:45:37.417
Hunslett?

397
00:45:40.921 --> 00:45:42.714
Hunslett!

398
00:46:22.004 --> 00:46:23.380
Hunslett?

399
00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:31.323
- I've got a gun.
- Let me up!


400
00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:35.577
You could be a dead man.
On your right, there's a light switch.


401
00:47:35.869 --> 00:47:38.663
Very slowly, switch it on.

402
00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:43.669
Thank you, Mr Calvert.

403
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:48.173
I've already got you for insolence,
insubordination and disobedience.


404
00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:52.719
Now it's armed assault. Do you
always greet your guests like this?


405
00:47:53.011 --> 00:47:56.431
I don't have guests. I don't have friends.
I only have enemies.


406
00:47:56.723 --> 00:47:59.726
Don't stand there.
Get me a whisky and soda.


407
00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:01.936
I came by RAF plane and launch.

408
00:48:02.229 --> 00:48:06.650
All the bloody people offered me
were tea bags. Where's Hunslett?


409
00:48:06.942 --> 00:48:08.777
The last time I
saw him was this morning.

410
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:12.614
I hope nothing's happened. We can't
afford to lose any more personnel.


411
00:48:12.906 --> 00:48:14.741
Personnel?

412
00:48:15.033 --> 00:48:19.533
He's not personnel to me. He's been
my friend for the last ten years.


413
00:48:20.372 --> 00:48:22.248
And I'll tell you another thing.

414
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:26.545
You can add another statistic
to your deaths in the line of duty.


415
00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.672
The helicopter pilot.

416
00:48:28.964 --> 00:48:32.717
It's only by the grace of God
you're not adding mine to it.


417
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.887
You were ordered to return. 
You disobeyed.

418
00:48:37.222 --> 00:48:39.474
I used my better judgment.

419
00:48:39.766 --> 00:48:43.603
As the person on the spot,
I considered my judgment more relevant


420
00:48:43.895 --> 00:48:47.023
that that of people
sitting in elegant Whitehall offices.


421
00:48:47.315 --> 00:48:51.815
Calm down. I understand your feelings.
You're right about the area.


422
00:48:52.237 --> 00:48:56.491
Those wheels you asked me to set
in motion, I've come up with answers.


423
00:48:56.783 --> 00:49:00.495
- It's still your job, Calvert.
- Thank you, Sir.


424
00:49:00.787 --> 00:49:05.287
Now then. You wanted to know about
missing vessels around these coasts.


425
00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:09.045
September 4th. 
Pinto - cruiser.

426
00:49:09.337 --> 00:49:13.007
Left the Kyles of Lochaish
for Arran. Vanished.


427
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.800
April 6th. Evening Star. April 10th.
Jenny Rose. Both fishing boats.


428
00:49:18.847 --> 00:49:23.347
May 17th. Sailing boat with highly
experienced crew from Londonderry.


429
00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:28.394
A few weeks ago, the Kingfisher,
on a night cruise from Torbay.


430
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.400
What about the dates?

431
00:49:30.692 --> 00:49:35.071
All within 48 hours of the disappearance
of the bullion ships.


432
00:49:36.531 --> 00:49:38.950
There've been too many accidents on land.

433
00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:42.787
A policeman and his family,
the local squire and his family.


434
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.123
And a Lord Kirkside. 
Do you know him?

435
00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:48.668
I read about that.
I think we met once, vaguely.


436
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.003
Grouse shooting in Peebles.

437
00:49:51.296 --> 00:49:54.799
What about the names 
- Lavorski and Imrie?

438
00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.177
Nothing came up before I left.

439
00:49:57.469 --> 00:50:00.763
I say, do you have anything palatable
to eat on this boat?


440
00:50:01.056 --> 00:50:02.599
Beans.

441
00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:06.519
What about sleeping accommodation?

442
00:50:06.812 --> 00:50:08.980
I don't think we will be sleeping.

443
00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:12.775
If we assume they've got Hunslett,
they'll assume they've got me.


444
00:50:13.068 --> 00:50:15.153
If they see lights, they'll come visiting.

445
00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:18.823
- What are we going to do?
- We'll manage.


446
00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.185
They're coming. Get ready.

447
00:52:01.426 --> 00:52:04.762
- Where's the other one?
- About 20 fathoms below.


448
00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:08.975
You can't go round like a one-man
execution squad. This is England.


449
00:52:09.267 --> 00:52:12.061
It's all very well for you sitting
in an office.


450
00:52:12.354 --> 00:52:15.357
People like me are
just pins on a map.

451
00:52:15.649 --> 00:52:18.610
That's what it's all about.
It's either him or me.


452
00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:21.779
I appreciate your point
but not your manner.


453
00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:24.741
- What do we do with him?
- Hand him over to the police.


454
00:52:25.033 --> 00:52:28.161
He's making a terrible mess of the carpet.

455
00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:36.085
Why don't you get something to eat?
I'll check up on the lord.


456
00:52:36.378 --> 00:52:39.631
- You won't kill anybody else?
- Good Lord, no.


457
00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:43.217
Good. I must get
some hot food inside me.

458
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:47.347
Bloody RAF with their damn cheese rolls.

459
00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:12.951
If you got yourself a walkie-talkie,
you wouldn't have to row across.


460
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.666
The Shangri-la.

461
00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:19.379
How about these boys of yours
that died recently?


462
00:53:20.547 --> 00:53:22.924
Who are you? Police?

463
00:53:23.216 --> 00:53:27.386
Sort of. I think you'd better
come and see a friend of mine.


464
00:53:27.679 --> 00:53:32.141
They said they would kill my boys.
I had no choice.


465
00:53:32.434 --> 00:53:34.894
I just have to string along with them.

466
00:53:35.186 --> 00:53:39.440
Like bringing them as Customs men
to your boat to smash the radio.


467
00:53:39.733 --> 00:53:44.233
Like keeping silent when I see all
the criminal goings-on around here.


468
00:53:44.612 --> 00:53:47.072
People and boats disappear, you know,

469
00:53:47.365 --> 00:53:50.993
and some boats get smashed up
if they go in certain places.


470
00:53:51.286 --> 00:53:53.121
It's incredible. Skouras.

471
00:53:53.413 --> 00:53:57.913
Yes, sir. There's a Captain Imrie
sometimes and a man called Quinn...


472
00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:02.922
Sergeant, let me give you
some harsh facts of life.


473
00:54:03.214 --> 00:54:07.676
My colleague is missing, a pilot was
killed today and I should have been.


474
00:54:07.969 --> 00:54:11.347
48 hours ago, two of Sir Arthur's
agents were murdered


475
00:54:11.639 --> 00:54:13.766
on a boat out in Loch Huron.

476
00:54:14.059 --> 00:54:17.187
They may or may not have your boys
in safe keeping


477
00:54:17.479 --> 00:54:20.607
but you can't afford
to take promises from them.


478
00:54:20.899 --> 00:54:24.819
- You've got to help us, and fast.
- What do you want me to do?


479
00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.782
It's the dawn.

480
00:54:30.075 --> 00:54:32.786
I've seen the dawn before, thank you!

481
00:54:33.078 --> 00:54:34.913
Duck shooting, was it?

482
00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.582
Don't be so bloody insolent!

483
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:42.712
Especially at sea.
Especially before breakfast.


484
00:54:52.514 --> 00:54:54.307
Help!

485
00:54:56.267 --> 00:55:00.020
- Hey, who's that?
- I've no idea. Come on.


486
00:55:02.857 --> 00:55:04.650
Help!

487
00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.654
All right. Come on.

488
00:55:08.947 --> 00:55:12.283
All right. You're safe. 
Give me your hand.

489
00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:14.493
Come on. Up you come.

490
00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.206
Come on.

491
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.636
I wanted to warn you.

492
00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:34.096
Last night, the policeman -

493
00:55:34.389 --> 00:55:37.683
MacDonald, I think he's called -
came aboard.


494
00:55:37.976 --> 00:55:39.936
Goon.

495
00:55:40.228 --> 00:55:44.440
When he left, they -
I mean my husband and the others...


496
00:55:45.567 --> 00:55:47.902
- They decided you must be stopped.
- Stopped?


497
00:55:48.194 --> 00:55:50.196
You know what I mean.

498
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:54.867
I've known for ages something was wrong.

499
00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:59.581
- Strange journeys. Strange men aboard.
- Why did you want to warn us?


500
00:55:59.873 --> 00:56:01.749
- That's obvious.
- Shut up!


501
00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:03.751
Goon.

502
00:56:04.043 --> 00:56:08.543
You were the only one around.
And I had to get off that boat.


503
00:56:09.048 --> 00:56:13.548
- Again, why?
- I wanted to see how the other half sail.


504
00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:18.308
You must forgive Mr Calvert.
He has naturally bad manners.


505
00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:22.436
Let me help.

506
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:27.191
You took a great
risk coming here, my dear.

507
00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:29.486
I had nothing to lose.

508
00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:34.073
We've still got a lot to lose.

509
00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:40.162
Let's go. We've wasted enough time already.

510
00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:31.672
Are you sure it's Loch Huron?

511
00:57:31.965 --> 00:57:35.468
Du Skea. Must be by process of elimination.

512
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.097
The castle's a natural base. Someone
radioed that I was in the helicopter.


513
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:44.435
If there's more intimidation,
it fits in with the Kirkside situation.


514
00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.687
The daughter's attitude.

515
00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.649
Ah, we've got company.

516
00:57:53.695 --> 00:57:55.697
They're coming for me.

517
00:57:58.449 --> 00:58:02.119
Open the wheelhouse door,
keep it back on the latch.


518
00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:06.874
Take the wheel. When I shout,
turn it about, then cut the engine.


519
00:58:20.972 --> 00:58:23.057
Now!

520
00:58:29.731 --> 00:58:32.275
Look out. He's going to ram us!

521
00:58:34.861 --> 00:58:36.612
Down!

522
00:58:48.916 --> 00:58:51.335
Stop engines.

523
00:59:18.404 --> 00:59:21.240
The ranks of the ungodly
are being depleted.


524
00:59:21.532 --> 00:59:24.326
That killing isn't necessary
just to protect me.


525
00:59:24.619 --> 00:59:27.622
Neither do I.
That was to square things for Hunslett.


526
00:59:27.914 --> 00:59:32.414
Why are we going to Du Skea?
Or do I mind my own business?


527
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:34.586
I can't take much more of this.

528
00:59:34.879 --> 00:59:37.506
We're going to prove
Britannia rules the waves.


529
00:59:37.799 --> 00:59:41.636
We're onto them and it doesn't give
them much time to unload their bullion.


530
00:59:41.928 --> 00:59:45.139
- They can't unload bullion here.
- Yes. Loch Huron.


531
00:59:45.431 --> 00:59:49.931
You can't hide a freighter the size
of the Nanceville in Loch Huron.


532
00:59:51.312 --> 00:59:54.356
It's easy to hide a ship.
Just open the sea cocks.


533
00:59:54.649 --> 00:59:57.943
They're not in Loch Huron.
They're under it.


534
01:00:05.993 --> 01:00:09.913
The young woman made this.
It ought to be drinkable.


535
01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:12.833
- Did you get through?
- Yes.


536
01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.962
Food for thought.

537
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.927
There was a Captain Imrie in charge
of a Skouras Line ship -


538
01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:26.347
a liner on a luxury cruise in 1963.

539
01:00:27.849 --> 01:00:30.268
She went down with 70 lives.

540
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.645
There would have been a big stink

541
01:00:32.937 --> 01:00:37.437
but Imrie took the whole rap
for pilot error. Interesting.


542
01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:42.279
I don't quite know what you're
getting at but never mind. Go on.


543
01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:45.783
I've told them that Annabel
is enjoying the cruise.


544
01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.785
Did you?

545
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:53.832
Tell me about the first Lady Skouras.
When did she die?


546
01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:55.918
About a year ago.

547
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:59.671
- Devoted couple?
- I always thought so. Why?


548
01:00:59.964 --> 01:01:03.008
I'm wondering
about the present Lady Skouras.


549
01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:07.346
I wonder when she met him.

550
01:01:07.638 --> 01:01:10.641
I must have a
word with the blushing bride.

551
01:01:21.652 --> 01:01:23.612
What are you doing?

552
01:01:23.905 --> 01:01:26.949
Taking this boat to Loch Huron
and trying to figure you out.


553
01:01:27.241 --> 01:01:30.661
- I don't know which is more difficult.
- Why bother?


554
01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:33.455
I want to put my mind at ease.

555
01:01:33.748 --> 01:01:35.583
There's nothing to know.

556
01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:39.879
I married a multi-millionaire
who turns out to be a crook.


557
01:01:40.171 --> 01:01:43.757
That would be all right
So long as he stays a rich crook...


558
01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:48.512
but I don't like being caged in
with all those other villains,


559
01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:51.682
I don't like being kicked around

560
01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:54.559
and I can't stand the Scottish weather.

561
01:01:56.312 --> 01:02:00.232
- So you walked out?
- I swam out. Remember?


562
01:02:00.525 --> 01:02:02.109
Yeah.

563
01:02:02.401 --> 01:02:04.820
No regrets about leaving anything behind?

564
01:02:05.112 --> 01:02:08.073
Yes. A very expensive wardrobe.

565
01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:15.994
Maybe you joined the wrong side.
Maybe we won't come out on top.


566
01:02:16.457 --> 01:02:18.292
I can always swim back.

567
01:02:30.221 --> 01:02:34.683
He wants to see you. God, you look
terrible. I hope it's not my coffee.


568
01:02:34.976 --> 01:02:39.230
Boats would be wonderful if only one
didn't have to go to sea in them.


569
01:02:48.322 --> 01:02:52.822
Keep her running up and down outside.
Don't get any nearer than we are.


570
01:03:28.821 --> 01:03:30.697
Fall out of your helicopter?

571
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.158
Yeah.

572
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:35.369
Cheers.

573
01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.706
Sorry about being so informal.

574
01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:42.209
Think nothing of it.
But next time bring a woman.


575
01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.796
Haven't you got enough?

576
01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.423
There's no pleasure
in just looking at them.


577
01:03:48.716 --> 01:03:52.010
That's like eating chocolate
with the paper on. Here.


578
01:03:52.303 --> 01:03:55.431
No, I'm driving. Listen. 
I need your help.

579
01:03:56.599 --> 01:04:01.099
I'd better tell you who I am
and what I want you to do for me.


580
01:04:01.687 --> 01:04:04.022
Not if you don't have another drink.

581
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:10.071
Look at that boat.

582
01:04:11.864 --> 01:04:13.866
It's coming here.

583
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:25.836
Here we go again.
Take the wheel, will you, dear?


584
01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:34.720
What are you trying to do?
Repel all boarders?


585
01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:37.848
Bring that gear aboard.

586
01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:51.820
Take it back to Torbay. Keep in sight
of the mainland till midnight.


587
01:04:55.408 --> 01:04:59.453
It's a hell of a story,
Sir Arthur, but we'll help.


588
01:04:59.745 --> 01:05:02.706
Anyhow, it make a change
from shark fishing.


589
01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:05.209
This boat's well known in the area.

590
01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:09.046
Tim will take us to Du Skea.
First we'll go to that place...


591
01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:12.591
I can never pronounce its name.
Mouth of the Grave.


592
01:05:12.883 --> 01:05:15.552
You'll never sail through there.

593
01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:19.473
Of course I will.
After a few more of these.


594
01:05:23.227 --> 01:05:25.229
Wish you hadn't come?

595
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.746
This is it if you're sure
it's this 14-fathom ledge.


596
01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:47.539
It must be. It's the only logical
place where you can sink a ship.


597
01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:51.087
Here at seven fathoms,
the sea bed is too flat -


598
01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.673
no place to hide masts or funnels.

599
01:05:53.966 --> 01:05:58.466
But beyond that, over here - 35 fathoms,
too deep, too much pressure.


600
01:06:00.139 --> 01:06:03.684
- 14 fathoms. The only logical place.
- Good luck.


601
01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:38.703
- It's the Shangri-la!
- Get below, you two.


602
01:12:43.208 --> 01:12:45.501
<i>On, it's Hutchinson's boat.</i>

603
01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:49.964
Yes. The local shark fisherman.
No panic. It's all right.


604
01:12:50.257 --> 01:12:52.425
Is it?

605
01:12:53.677 --> 01:12:57.764
Because nothing
has been all right so far, has it?


606
01:13:11.028 --> 01:13:14.448
I can't see them unloading
that bullion before tomorrow.


607
01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:18.243
Maybe they'll take what they've got
and get out.


608
01:13:19.578 --> 01:13:22.706
They don't know for sure
that we know about the bullion.


609
01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:26.710
Anyway, I was lucky.
Quinn's death looks like an accident.


610
01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.837
Are we going in or not?

611
01:13:29.129 --> 01:13:31.589
My lads feel like a bit of exercise.

612
01:13:31.882 --> 01:13:33.717
First we go back to your place.

613
01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:37.095
They'll get all the exercise
they need at midnight -


614
01:13:37.387 --> 01:13:39.806
after I make sure other people are safe.

615
01:13:56.114 --> 01:13:58.032
You should get some beauty sleep.

616
01:13:58.325 --> 01:14:01.619
What did you mean about making sure
other people are safe?


617
01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:06.332
You look pale.

618
01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:09.044
You're losing that jet-set tan.

619
01:14:10.337 --> 01:14:13.131
You don't trust me
one bloody inch, do you?

620
01:14:13.423 --> 01:14:15.591
Does it feel good
to be a woman of intrigue?


621
01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.886
And mystery?

622
01:14:25.102 --> 01:14:28.814
- Do you want to make love to me?
- Yes.


623
01:14:37.155 --> 01:14:40.658
- Wanted to see how the bruises were.
- They're still there.


624
01:14:40.951 --> 01:14:43.495
Do you think I
put them on with make-up?

625
01:14:43.787 --> 01:14:46.372
I'm still not sure how they got there.

626
01:14:48.375 --> 01:14:50.251
I was beaten.

627
01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.422
Maybe you bruise easily.

628
01:14:55.841 --> 01:14:59.511
Then you'd better be
very gentle with me in bed.


629
01:14:59.803 --> 01:15:02.764
I will. I'll even take my boots off.

630
01:15:03.056 --> 01:15:05.224
I still haven't worked you out yet

631
01:15:05.517 --> 01:15:08.728
and I don't trust you one bloody inch.

632
01:15:09.021 --> 01:15:11.273
Anyway, just for the record.

633
01:15:17.195 --> 01:15:20.323
You've been a long time at sea,
haven't you?


634
01:15:40.093 --> 01:15:43.137
This always worked in those war movies.

635
01:15:52.272 --> 01:15:55.858
Aye. It'll hold. 
See you at midnight then.

636
01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:58.111
Eight bells. Cheers. Good luck.

637
01:15:58.403 --> 01:16:00.196
- And to you.
- Thanks.


638
01:18:34.059 --> 01:18:37.520
Wake up. Room service.
I want to see Miss Kirkside.


639
01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:39.648
Move.

640
01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:43.401
That's right. That's my boy. Move!

641
01:18:44.611 --> 01:18:46.446
That's better.

642
01:18:56.581 --> 01:19:00.293
- What do you want? What's going on?
- Get dressed.


643
01:19:00.585 --> 01:19:03.337
- What's happening?
- Move, girl. Move.


644
01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:07.592
- I'm your knight in shining arm our.
- You're the man from the helicopter.


645
01:19:07.884 --> 01:19:12.221
Have you got a belt?
A cord or something? Wake up, girl!


646
01:19:17.561 --> 01:19:19.312
Will this do? Who are you?

647
01:19:19.604 --> 01:19:22.565
Don't ask questions. 
Get some clothes on.

648
01:19:24.109 --> 01:19:26.528
What are you doing here?

649
01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:29.489
Strangely enough, 
I'm one of the good guys.

650
01:19:29.781 --> 01:19:34.281
Which means I'm on the side of law
and order and I haven't much time.


651
01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:39.249
Right? I want some answers
and I want some help.


652
01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:43.044
No. Please. You mustn't do anything.

653
01:19:43.336 --> 01:19:45.171
You mustn't.

654
01:19:45.463 --> 01:19:49.633
There are prisoners here, aren't there?
Hostages. Aren't there?!


655
01:19:49.926 --> 01:19:51.886
They'll be in danger if you do anything.

656
01:19:52.178 --> 01:19:54.513
They'll be in a bloody sight more
if I don't.


657
01:19:54.806 --> 01:19:56.849
Things are going to happen tonight.

658
01:19:57.142 --> 01:19:59.144
I'm here to get these people away.

659
01:19:59.436 --> 01:20:01.479
Your brother and boyfriend.

660
01:20:02.647 --> 01:20:05.858
MacDonald's sons. Anyone else?

661
01:20:06.151 --> 01:20:08.111
Some fishermen and the woman.

662
01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:10.238
What woman?

663
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:12.448
Lady Skouras.

664
01:20:13.867 --> 01:20:15.869
Lady Skouras?

665
01:20:19.164 --> 01:20:21.583
- Where are they?
- In the dungeons.


666
01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:25.670
- But they're guarded and locked.
- Come on.


667
01:20:39.309 --> 01:20:42.395
- You've got to distract the guard.
- How?


668
01:20:43.521 --> 01:20:45.147
Guess.

669
01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.443
- Don't do that!
- What do you expect?


670
01:20:48.735 --> 01:20:52.196
The last thing I need is that,
especially on the staircase.


671
01:20:52.489 --> 01:20:54.991
- Just distract the guard.
- What do I do?


672
01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:59.745
- Just appear. Lust will do the rest.
- What if he doesn't fancy me?


673
01:21:00.038 --> 01:21:03.499
All we need is a guard that's queer.
Please. Go on.


674
01:21:24.938 --> 01:21:29.150
Have you?
Have you got a drink or something?


675
01:21:33.697 --> 01:21:35.615
I could get some.

676
01:21:35.907 --> 01:21:37.825
Whisky would be nice.

677
01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:41.579
Feeling the heat, are you?

678
01:21:45.208 --> 01:21:47.376
Is it loaded?

679
01:21:50.964 --> 01:21:52.966
Yeah. It sure is.

680
01:21:59.973 --> 01:22:02.141
Sins of the flesh, my friend...

681
01:22:03.268 --> 01:22:05.270
never pay.

682
01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:14.191
"Is it loaded"! You must learn more
than deer stalking in the Highlands.


683
01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:29.586
Why don't we go upstairs?
It's much warmer. Lady Skouras.


684
01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.045
Good evening.

685
01:22:31.337 --> 01:22:34.381
Take everyone to your room
and lock yourselves in.


686
01:22:34.674 --> 01:22:38.803
- What are you going to do?
- There are complications.


687
01:22:39.095 --> 01:22:43.265
I didn't realise Skouras was
a blackmail victim. He's one of us.


688
01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:46.394
- They've got one of theirs with us.
- Who's he?


689
01:22:46.686 --> 01:22:49.105
It's not a he, it's a she.

690
01:22:51.274 --> 01:22:55.194
You should know, Mr Hutchinson,
how much I appreciate your help.


691
01:22:55.487 --> 01:22:58.323
Your loyalty, sense of duty
and public spirit


692
01:22:58.615 --> 01:23:02.243
one doesn't meet with often
in this day and age.


693
01:23:02.535 --> 01:23:06.705
Your mate told us how much the
insurance companies would cough up.


694
01:23:06.998 --> 01:23:11.498
Did he? Mr Calvert is not my "mate".
He and I have little in common.


695
01:23:12.045 --> 01:23:15.089
Have you been there before?
Do you know the boathouse?


696
01:23:15.381 --> 01:23:17.216
Do you know how big it is?

697
01:23:17.509 --> 01:23:19.886
Aye. Boathouse door is 17 feet wide.

698
01:23:20.178 --> 01:23:24.307
- And this boat?
- A15-foot beam and no beacons.


699
01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:27.935
We can never take it in
without ending up on the rocks.


700
01:23:29.979 --> 01:23:32.231
There's only one way to find out.

701
01:23:32.524 --> 01:23:35.818
Besides, your mate would never forgive me.

702
01:24:10.728 --> 01:24:12.604
Take it.

703
01:24:15.275 --> 01:24:17.944
I've got it. Watch it.

704
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:24.283
Steady.

705
01:24:36.796 --> 01:24:38.714
Take the weight.

706
01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:42.343
Bring it up. Careful!

707
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.813
All right. Stop.
Hold everything. Get ready.


708
01:24:54.105 --> 01:24:56.273
Get out of sight! Quick!

709
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:03.405
Hurry up!

710
01:25:38.191 --> 01:25:41.027
There it is. Du Skea castle.

711
01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:27.824
Don't move! You're covered on all sides!

712
01:26:29.075 --> 01:26:31.243
Put down those guns!

713
01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:33.704
Slowly.

714
01:26:33.997 --> 01:26:36.165
That's it. Thank you.

715
01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:41.170
I'm so sorry. I'm afraid we're trespassing.

716
01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:45.962
Yes, you are. I believe Calvert
is loose somewhere in the grounds.


717
01:26:46.259 --> 01:26:50.137
My wife left her last radio message
rather late.


718
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:54.930
- Your wife?
- To love, hon our and obey.


719
01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:59.063
You know how it goes.

720
01:26:59.355 --> 01:27:03.855
Get out of the way, darling.
I don't want you to get hurt.


721
01:28:33.199 --> 01:28:34.950
No! Please!

722
01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.745
- You're making a terrible mistake.
- All right.


723
01:28:38.037 --> 01:28:41.165
- Charnley. Get Charniey!
- Lord Charnley of LIoyds?


724
01:28:41.457 --> 01:28:42.624
Yes!

725
01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:48.339
My God, there's nothing sacred.

726
01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:55.596
Hutchinson, stop him!

727
01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:32.883
Oh, you got him then? Well done.
I was just coming to lend a hand.


728
01:29:33.176 --> 01:29:35.928
- He had nothing to do with it.
- Nothing?


729
01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.556
Of course.
That's what I always said, wasn't it?


730
01:29:39.849 --> 01:29:41.767
Where's the girl?

731
01:29:42.894 --> 01:29:46.397
I wonder if she knows she's a widow.
Excuse me.


732
01:29:57.408 --> 01:29:59.410
Ah, there you are.

733
01:30:02.622 --> 01:30:04.707
What are you doing?

734
01:30:07.293 --> 01:30:10.587
You don't think you're going
anywhere, do you?


735
01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:19.054
You didn't kiss me goodbye.

736
01:30:20.556 --> 01:30:22.766
I would have written. Every day.

737
01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:28.773
- From sunny Acapulco or somewhere.
- Or from prison.


738
01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:33.402
You do keep rather bad company.

739
01:30:36.322 --> 01:30:38.949
I was only being a loyal wife.

740
01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:44.162
And now you're going
to be a loyal widow.

741
01:30:50.503 --> 01:30:53.964
Then I can make
a new start in life.

742
01:30:55.132 --> 01:30:57.801
Perhaps with you and...

743
01:30:58.094 --> 01:30:59.720
And what?

744
01:31:00.012 --> 01:31:01.930
Some of that gold down there.

745
01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:05.476
Perhaps. Who knows?

746
01:31:05.768 --> 01:31:09.188
Calvert had the idea...
Calvert and I had the idea


747
01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.900
of finding out the underwriters
of your shipping disaster.


748
01:31:13.192 --> 01:31:16.778
- I never thought of Lord Charnley.
- Yes. It was Charniey.


749
01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:18.697
I was being blackmailed.

750
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:22.201
They needed my finance
and they needed my cover.


751
01:31:22.493 --> 01:31:25.037
But when they took Anna, my wife,

752
01:31:25.329 --> 01:31:28.832
I had no choice
but to go along with them. No choice.


753
01:31:29.125 --> 01:31:32.586
I knew it. One has an instinct
about these things.


754
01:31:32.878 --> 01:31:34.880
A member of our wine committee.

755
01:31:35.172 --> 01:31:37.591
I told Calvert but he wouldn't listen.

756
01:31:37.883 --> 01:31:42.345
The trouble with Calvert
is he's not really a gentleman.


757
01:31:42.638 --> 01:31:44.056
Where did he get to?

758
01:31:56.652 --> 01:32:00.238
- Only one?
- Have you felt the weight of them?


759
01:32:05.036 --> 01:32:08.456
That'll keep you in luxury
in a hotel Acapulco for five years -


760
01:32:08.748 --> 01:32:12.460
SO long as you don't use room service
too much.


761
01:32:12.752 --> 01:32:14.587
Where are you going?

762
01:32:14.879 --> 01:32:16.714
It's all yours. 
I don't like the sun.

763
01:32:17.006 --> 01:32:20.676
- Gives me hay fever.
- Do you want me to stay?


764
01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:24.304
I didn't want to make
an honest woman out of you.


765
01:32:24.597 --> 01:32:27.725
I don't see us living
in domestic bliss. Do you?


766
01:32:28.017 --> 01:32:32.517
No. The nights would be good
but the days would be a drag.


767
01:32:34.732 --> 01:32:36.442
Well, bon voyage.

768
01:32:36.734 --> 01:32:39.194
Don't spend it all at once.

769
01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:42.823
What chance have I
of getting out of here without you?


770
01:32:43.115 --> 01:32:44.699
Not much, but a chance.

771
01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:48.370
All you're worried about is your job
and you do it right.


772
01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:53.163
That's all you do.
You're just a professional bastard.


773
01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:57.421
In the words of
a late friend of mine...

774
01:32:57.713 --> 01:32:59.381
it's what I do well.
