00:00:16.147 --> 00:00:19.107
The characters depicted in this film
are entirely fictitious.


2
00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:22.427
Any similarity to actual persons,
living or dead,


3
00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:26.747
is purely coincidental.

4
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.786
THE PHANTOM OF LlBERTY

5
00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:41.826
"The action begins in Toledo, in 1808,

6
00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:45.825
during the city's occupation
by Napoleon's army.


7
00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:49.025
lt is inspired by a tale
by Gustavo A. Becquer,


8
00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:51.145
the Spanish romantic poet.''

9
00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.099
Prisoners against the wall!

10
00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:18.418
First row, take your positions!

11
00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:22.018
Ready, aim -

12
00:02:22.418 --> 00:02:24.058
Down with liberty!

13
00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:26.138
Death to the French!

14
00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:28.338
Fire!

15
00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:15.094
l'm hungry.

16
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.810
Despite his wound,
and bent on revenge against the knight,


17
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.929
the captain wagered his fellow officers

18
00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.849
that he could bring Dona Elvira's
mortal remains to his bed.


19
00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:24.809
Nothing could deter him from his intent,

20
00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:28.888
and one night
he carried out his macabre plan.


21
00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:45.047
The mysterious hand of death

22
00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:47.687
had spared her face,

23
00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:52.207
which had remained
as fresh and delicate as a rose.


24
00:04:53.007 --> 00:04:55.086
They found her
beneath her tombstone


25
00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:58.006
amid her repugnant paraphernal -

26
00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.526
What's that?

27
00:04:59.726 --> 00:05:03.086
"Paraphernalia.''
ls that a sweet-smelling herb?


28
00:05:03.966 --> 00:05:06.206
ls it a rosary?
- Not that either.


29
00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:09.965
lt's a legal term for the personal
property of a married woman.


30
00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:15.485
But in English, the word " paraphernalia''
has a much broader meaning.


31
00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:20.525
lt refers to any accoutrements,
belongings, personal items,


32
00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:22.804
even fishing gear

33
00:05:22.964 --> 00:05:24.684
or a sewing kit.

34
00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:27.764
- Where were you?
- We went biking over the bridge.


35
00:05:27.964 --> 00:05:29.124
We're going to the slide.

36
00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:31.724
We're going soon.
We'll come get you.


37
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:12.441
You slid down so nicely.

38
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.520
l think l know you.
What's your name?


39
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.520
Veronique.

40
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.160
- And you?
- Valerie.


41
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.120
Yes, of course.

42
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.960
Since you two are so nice,

43
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.680
l'm going to give you a charming gift.

44
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.519
Come with me -
- Our bikes are over there.


45
00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:31.359
Let's go.

46
00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:46.438
And now,

47
00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:50.158
l'm going to show you
some very pretty pictures.


48
00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:53.838
But you mustn't
show them to anyone.


49
00:06:55.117 --> 00:06:56.917
lf you want them,
you have to promise.


50
00:07:03.037 --> 00:07:04.437
Just look.

51
00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:15.076
They're for you.

52
00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:17.436
Show them to your friends.

53
00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:19.396
But no grown-ups.

54
00:07:19.676 --> 00:07:21.315
You'll remember that?

55
00:07:40.074 --> 00:07:41.914
l'm sick of symmetry.

56
00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:56.073
Henri.

57
00:07:56.313 --> 00:07:57.793
Back already?

58
00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:00.393
What do you mean?
l never went out.


59
00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:03.112
Don't you feel well?

60
00:08:04.112 --> 00:08:07.152
l don't know what's wrong.
l'm on edge, tired.


61
00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.032
lt's true.

62
00:08:13.232 --> 00:08:15.351
l've noticed it myself lately.

63
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:18.751
Since Veronique's
on vacation this week,


64
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:20.751
let's go down to the seashore.

65
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:23.871
Why the sea?
The sea's no longer the sea.


66
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:28.310
Hello, Mommy.

67
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.750
Look what someone gave me.

68
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.910
l passed you in the street yesterday
and you didn't even recognize me.


69
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.150
l haven't been sleeping well lately.

70
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.669
l haven't mentioned it,
but sometimes l lie awake all night.


71
00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.709
You should get a checkup,
just to be sure.


72
00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:49.789
Don't say " checkup. ''
There's a proper French term for it:


73
00:08:50.189 --> 00:08:51.149
general examination.

74
00:08:51.549 --> 00:08:54.388
lt's too long.
"General examination.''


75
00:08:54.628 --> 00:08:56.148
Checkup is much quicker.

76
00:08:56.348 --> 00:08:57.908
What's the hurry?

77
00:09:02.348 --> 00:09:03.268
Francoise!

78
00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:11.107
Come here.

79
00:09:12.907 --> 00:09:16.467
Where did you get these?
- A nice man gave them to me.


80
00:09:16.787 --> 00:09:19.147
So, you let her talk to strangers?

81
00:09:19.347 --> 00:09:22.266
l didn't see anything.
l didn't know.


82
00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:25.466
The man seemed very nice.
He even offered us candy.


83
00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:28.186
l've warned you before.

84
00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:31.866
lf you ever accept anything
from a stranger again,


85
00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:33.546
watch out!

86
00:09:33.746 --> 00:09:35.585
Time for her snack.
- Yes, madam.


87
00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:46.225
This is disgraceful!

88
00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:47.664
Let me see.

89
00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:51.864
Can you imagine!

90
00:09:52.064 --> 00:09:53.984
Disgusting, but what can you do?

91
00:09:54.184 --> 00:09:55.824
l'm at my wits' end.

92
00:09:56.024 --> 00:09:58.384
l can't always keep an eye on her.

93
00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:00.144
Look at this.

94
00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:03.663
Remember? lt was in Milan.

95
00:10:04.023 --> 00:10:05.663
At your parents' home.

96
00:10:06.863 --> 00:10:08.983
We were too young.

97
00:10:09.183 --> 00:10:10.823
But it was magnificent!

98
00:10:11.263 --> 00:10:12.863
And you didn't want to -

99
00:10:14.622 --> 00:10:16.302
Veronique might hear us.

100
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:30.461
lncredible.

101
00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:33.901
Revolting.

102
00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:39.461
- Sickening!
- What can you expect nowadays?


103
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.260
This one could pass.

104
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.540
This one is indecent.

105
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.340
That may be okay for old fogies,
but not for me.


106
00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:00.819
No, not this!

107
00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:02.899
- Let me see.
- What for?


108
00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:04.259
Why not?

109
00:11:04.499 --> 00:11:06.059
Let me see it.

110
00:11:12.898 --> 00:11:13.978
You're right.

111
00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:16.098
This is going too far.

112
00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:20.817
Call the maid.

113
00:11:25.777 --> 00:11:26.977
Francoise.

114
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.896
l'm going to skip dinner tonight
and turn in early.


115
00:11:35.096 --> 00:11:37.616
You should see a doctor. l insist.

116
00:11:39.696 --> 00:11:42.376
- Here, you can keep them.
- Thanks, Daddy.


117
00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:44.536
May l trade them
for some spider pictures?


118
00:11:44.736 --> 00:11:46.216
lf you like.

119
00:11:49.015 --> 00:11:50.375
Madam called?

120
00:11:50.575 --> 00:11:53.735
After today's incident,
it's best you leave us.


121
00:11:53.935 --> 00:11:56.575
But l had nothing to do with it.
l didn't know -


122
00:11:56.775 --> 00:12:00.055
Settle things with my wife,
then get out.


123
00:12:00.374 --> 00:12:03.974
l'm sorry, but under the circumstances,
there's nothing l can do.


124
00:12:04.454 --> 00:12:07.054
Of course, you can stay the night.

125
00:12:07.254 --> 00:12:09.174
Let's work out what we owe you.

126
00:12:12.894 --> 00:12:16.413
- This one's a water spider.
- Very good, darling.


127
00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:21.733
l drew that one.
lt's a wolf spider.


128
00:12:21.933 --> 00:12:24.413
No, darling,
it's a trapdoor spider.


129
00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:27.212
A species you won't find in France,
sad to say.


130
00:13:27.688 --> 00:13:28.808
Helene.

131
00:14:53.441 --> 00:14:54.241
That's enough.

132
00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:57.521
That really is enough.

133
00:14:58.121 --> 00:14:59.841
l'm sorry, Mr. Foucauld,

134
00:15:00.361 --> 00:15:02.081
but this isn't my specialty.

135
00:15:02.441 --> 00:15:04.361
We're both wasting our time.

136
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:06.121
But what should l do?

137
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.800
Physically,
there's nothing wrong with you.


138
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.560
lf you want to discuss your dreams,
see a psychoanalyst.


139
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.560
He'll listen to you -
for months, years, if he has to.


140
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.039
Doctor, it wasn't a dream.
l have the postman's letter.


141
00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:22.199
Look.

142
00:15:30.119 --> 00:15:31.879
- Doctor?
- What?


143
00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:33.678
May l see you a moment?

144
00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:35.598
Can't it wait?

145
00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:37.758
lt's rather urgent.

146
00:15:40.598 --> 00:15:41.758
Excuse me.

147
00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:50.517
My father is very sick.

148
00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:53.917
What's wrong with him?

149
00:15:54.237 --> 00:15:56.837
He's already had two attacks.
He's old.


150
00:15:57.077 --> 00:15:58.757
l'd like to go see him.

151
00:15:59.117 --> 00:16:01.476
We're very busy right now.

152
00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:04.156
Will you be away long?

153
00:16:04.356 --> 00:16:07.236
A couple of days.
l'll be back as soon as possible.


154
00:16:07.556 --> 00:16:10.716
- All right, then.
- Thank you, Doctor.


155
00:16:58.992 --> 00:17:01.312
Excuse me, did you see
any foxes on the road?


156
00:17:01.512 --> 00:17:03.512
Foxes? No.

157
00:17:04.032 --> 00:17:07.631
- No foxes crossing the road?
- l didn't see a thing.


158
00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:09.511
What'd l tell you!

159
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:11.831
No foxes around here.
Never were!


160
00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:15.191
l had firsthand information, sir.
Maybe it's the storm.


161
00:17:15.511 --> 00:17:17.551
And we still have 30 miles to go.

162
00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:19.550
Enough time wasted! Let's go.

163
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.830
Excuse me,
are you going toward Argenton?


164
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.470
Be careful. There was a landslide
and the road may be out.


165
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.870
Good-bye, ma'am.

166
00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:36.869
Let's go!

167
00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:26.425
May l use your phone?

168
00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:28.865
The line's down because of the floods.

169
00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:32.865
- What will l do now? Do you have a room?
- Of course. Front or back?


170
00:18:33.065 --> 00:18:34.825
lt doesn't matter.
l'm leaving early.


171
00:18:35.025 --> 00:18:36.145
Would you like supper?

172
00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:38.824
No, just some milk and fruit.

173
00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:41.944
l'll just be a minute.
Go and dry off.


174
00:18:53.623 --> 00:18:55.103
What hellish weather!

175
00:18:55.303 --> 00:18:57.263
lt seems the Argenton road is out.

176
00:18:57.783 --> 00:18:59.143
Have a seat, madam.

177
00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:06.342
We're stranded here too.

178
00:19:06.582 --> 00:19:09.742
- Are you from around here?
- My family is. And you?


179
00:19:10.262 --> 00:19:12.742
St. Joseph's Monastery.
You must know it.


180
00:19:12.942 --> 00:19:15.262
l've been there with my father.

181
00:19:15.462 --> 00:19:19.221
l'm going to see him. He's sick.
Who knows if l'll find him alive.


182
00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:21.581
What's wrong with him?

183
00:19:22.821 --> 00:19:24.141
l'm afraid for him.

184
00:19:24.821 --> 00:19:27.261
The heart.
The disease of our times.


185
00:19:27.581 --> 00:19:29.581
The bustle, the anxiety,

186
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:31.061
the traveling.

187
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:34.300
My father runs a small farm.
He never travels.


188
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.460
He doesn't read the papers.
He doesn't have a phone.


189
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.940
lf everybody prayed to St. Joseph

190
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.659
and spent 30 minutes a day
in meditation,


191
00:19:46.379 --> 00:19:48.339
we'd all be perfectly relaxed.

192
00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:49.299
Surely.

193
00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:54.059
Whenever you're ready.

194
00:19:59.578 --> 00:20:01.098
This way.

195
00:20:26.856 --> 00:20:28.096
Excuse me, ma'am.

196
00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:38.415
Would you like an extra blanket?

197
00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:40.695
No, l sleep with the windows shut.

198
00:20:40.895 --> 00:20:42.535
ls there hot water?
- Of course.


199
00:20:42.735 --> 00:20:44.935
Shall l wake you?
- No need.


200
00:20:45.135 --> 00:20:46.855
Then good night, ma'am.

201
00:23:41.282 --> 00:23:42.122
Who is it?

202
00:23:42.682 --> 00:23:45.401
lt's Father Gabriel.
l'd like a word with you.


203
00:23:46.841 --> 00:23:48.161
Just a moment.

204
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:57.081
Good evening, madam.
May l?


205
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.680
Do you know what this is?
- Yes. lt's an image.


206
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.240
A miraculous image of St. Joseph.

207
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.920
lt can have surprising effects
on the sick.


208
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.480
- Really?
- l'm thinking of your father.


209
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.719
Faith can sometimes triumph
where science has failed.


210
00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:18.359
We just saw
the Marquise de la Pomarede.


211
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:20.439
Yesterday she was near death.

212
00:24:20.639 --> 00:24:23.519
We brought her the image.

213
00:24:24.358 --> 00:24:25.918
We prayed.

214
00:24:26.878 --> 00:24:29.478
This morning
when we left the chateau -


215
00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:32.118
- She was cured?
- She felt a little better.


216
00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:36.558
You play cards, madam?

217
00:24:37.158 --> 00:24:39.157
Sometimes, when l'm alone.

218
00:24:39.677 --> 00:24:40.917
l play solitaire.

219
00:24:41.117 --> 00:24:42.997
So do l. lt's very relaxing.

220
00:24:43.717 --> 00:24:45.317
That must be the fathers.

221
00:24:57.356 --> 00:24:59.596
And now, with your permission,

222
00:25:00.276 --> 00:25:02.156
we shall pray for your father.

223
00:25:02.596 --> 00:25:05.795
l don't know how to thank you.
l'm deeply touched.


224
00:25:14.795 --> 00:25:16.355
Would you like a rosary?

225
00:25:16.635 --> 00:25:17.714
Yes, thank you.

226
00:25:29.754 --> 00:25:32.153
Let us meditate tonight
on the sorrowful mystery


227
00:25:32.313 --> 00:25:34.953
of Christ's agony
on the Mount of Olives.


228
00:25:35.153 --> 00:25:36.953
Our Father, who art in heaven...

229
00:25:52.432 --> 00:25:54.712
Hail Mary, full of grace...

230
00:25:57.911 --> 00:26:00.271
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners


231
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:02.751
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.


232
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.510
- l'm in.
- Raise you 10.


233
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.670
- Pass.
- l'll see you and raise you a scapular.


234
00:26:24.469 --> 00:26:25.749
l open.

235
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:31.149
- How many cards?
- Two.


236
00:26:36.589 --> 00:26:39.068
Virgins are 10
and sacred hearts are 25, right?


237
00:26:39.268 --> 00:26:41.148
Yes, and scapulars are 50.

238
00:26:41.948 --> 00:26:43.108
l open with a virgin.

239
00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:49.468
Full house, jacks over eights.

240
00:26:53.867 --> 00:26:56.947
Didn't you say your father
once lived in the colonies?


241
00:26:57.747 --> 00:27:00.267
No. He never left
these parts. Why?


242
00:27:00.467 --> 00:27:01.627
Oh, nothing.

243
00:27:01.827 --> 00:27:03.147
Place your bets.

244
00:27:05.906 --> 00:27:07.866
She was so mischievous.

245
00:27:08.186 --> 00:27:09.386
Who?

246
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:13.906
A pious lady who used to visit us.
Her husband was in the army.


247
00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.586
- What about her?
- Nothing, nothing.


248
00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:17.985
Father Gabriel.

249
00:27:18.825 --> 00:27:21.025
l didn't say anything unusual.

250
00:27:25.025 --> 00:27:27.145
Those must be the late guests
l was expecting.


251
00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:29.425
lf you'll excuse me.

252
00:27:33.264 --> 00:27:35.224
Which is higher,
a flush or a straight?


253
00:27:35.424 --> 00:27:36.784
A flush.

254
00:27:38.104 --> 00:27:39.144
Then l raise you 10.

255
00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:59.462
- ls our room ready?
- Yes. lt's very nice.


256
00:28:00.142 --> 00:28:02.702
You have a view of the mountain.
Very quiet.


257
00:28:03.502 --> 00:28:07.102
lt's late, but if you want dinner,
a snack or a sandwich -


258
00:28:07.302 --> 00:28:09.982
No, thank you. The lady is tired.
We'll get some rest.


259
00:28:10.821 --> 00:28:12.661
Take their luggage up.

260
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.340
What time would you like breakfast?

261
00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.420
We'll come down.

262
00:28:48.699 --> 00:28:51.458
Would madam like anything?
A bottle of mineral water?


263
00:28:51.658 --> 00:28:52.938
Nothing, thank you.

264
00:28:56.618 --> 00:28:57.978
Good night.

265
00:29:13.457 --> 00:29:14.977
Alea jacta est.

266
00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:18.776
What do you mean?

267
00:29:18.976 --> 00:29:20.176
That this is wonderful.

268
00:29:21.576 --> 00:29:23.576
Come sit next to me. Come on.

269
00:29:25.736 --> 00:29:28.096
- The things you make me do -
- Don't be nervous.


270
00:29:28.616 --> 00:29:30.575
You heard the man.
lt's very quiet here.


271
00:29:31.175 --> 00:29:32.935
- Too quiet.
- Sit down.


272
00:29:36.215 --> 00:29:37.495
Take off your glasses.

273
00:29:44.934 --> 00:29:47.774
What's wrong?
You seemed so happy about coming.


274
00:29:48.534 --> 00:29:51.534
- Why did l listen to you?
- How l've waited for this.


275
00:29:51.734 --> 00:29:54.494
Please, Francois, take me home.

276
00:29:55.174 --> 00:29:56.653
Why did you come then?

277
00:29:57.173 --> 00:29:59.013
Because l can't refuse you anything.

278
00:30:04.533 --> 00:30:06.093
For once we're alone,

279
00:30:06.413 --> 00:30:08.493
without my mother,
my brothers, my sisters.


280
00:30:09.572 --> 00:30:13.692
lt had become unbearable, having you
near me, always having to lie.


281
00:30:13.932 --> 00:30:15.532
For me as well, Francois.

282
00:30:16.252 --> 00:30:18.212
But how can we avoid lying?

283
00:30:23.851 --> 00:30:25.411
Sit down here.

284
00:30:29.611 --> 00:30:31.571
All my life, l've
felt you close to me.

285
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:34.251
Your perfume, your presence.

286
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.290
The times l held you on my lap
when you were a child.


287
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.330
When l think of a woman,
it's always you l see.


288
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:47.210
Of all my nephews,

289
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.370
l've always loved you the best.

290
00:30:55.769 --> 00:30:57.369
Remember that Holy Thursday,

291
00:30:58.009 --> 00:31:00.449
sitting side by side
in the church's dim light?


292
00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:03.928
Your hand was resting on the pew.

293
00:31:04.728 --> 00:31:08.608
Gently, l put my hand on yours
and squeezed it.


294
00:31:09.248 --> 00:31:11.448
l felt your fingers close around mine.

295
00:31:12.568 --> 00:31:14.168
l didn't dare believe it.

296
00:31:14.848 --> 00:31:16.327
l waited for a moment.

297
00:31:16.687 --> 00:31:18.927
Then l looked at you.

298
00:31:19.727 --> 00:31:22.807
You looked at me
and leaned toward me,


299
00:31:23.927 --> 00:31:26.407
and we kissed for the first time.

300
00:31:27.327 --> 00:31:29.047
We couldn't help ourselves.

301
00:31:44.605 --> 00:31:46.325
l won't touch you.

302
00:31:46.685 --> 00:31:48.645
But there's one thing
l want more than anything.


303
00:31:48.845 --> 00:31:49.925
What?

304
00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:52.005
- To see you naked.
- lmpossible.


305
00:31:52.205 --> 00:31:55.125
- l won't leave here until l do.
- l couldn't.


306
00:31:55.365 --> 00:32:00.004
l've never been naked in front of a man.
No man has ever touched me.


307
00:32:01.204 --> 00:32:02.564
Take off your clothes.

308
00:32:03.484 --> 00:32:05.684
lf you refuse,
you know l'll stop at nothing.


309
00:32:08.004 --> 00:32:09.203
Shit!

310
00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:24.762
Take off your clothes.

311
00:32:25.762 --> 00:32:27.722
You promise you won't touch me?

312
00:32:29.442 --> 00:32:30.922
Lock the door.

313
00:32:37.241 --> 00:32:38.321
Turn around.

314
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.040
lt's no good. l can't do it.

315
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.719
- But you said -
- l said nothing!


316
00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:08.519
What's got into you? Stop it!

317
00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:12.119
You swear you won't touch me?

318
00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:13.719
l swear.

319
00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:16.718
Turn around.

320
00:33:29.877 --> 00:33:31.957
What must they be thinking at home?

321
00:33:33.917 --> 00:33:35.437
They'll be waiting for us.

322
00:33:40.517 --> 00:33:43.396
You know your mother.
She's so easily worried.


323
00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:47.836
They may think we had an accident.

324
00:33:48.436 --> 00:33:50.556
What with the phone lines down...

325
00:33:52.636 --> 00:33:55.076
Well, too bad. We'll see.

326
00:34:03.995 --> 00:34:05.275
Are you ready?

327
00:34:05.555 --> 00:34:07.715
You can turn around if you want.

328
00:34:14.234 --> 00:34:15.994
For pity's sake, Francois.

329
00:34:17.714 --> 00:34:18.954
Don't be frightened.

330
00:34:19.194 --> 00:34:20.394
Let me.

331
00:34:21.954 --> 00:34:23.193
You swore.

332
00:34:37.112 --> 00:34:38.472
One second.

333
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:53.351
lt's better like this, isn't it?

334
00:34:57.871 --> 00:34:59.751
Let go of me or l'll scream!

335
00:35:00.511 --> 00:35:02.150
Help!

336
00:35:38.828 --> 00:35:40.188
l'll light your way.

337
00:35:43.627 --> 00:35:46.307
Just light a candle
and the power comes back.


338
00:35:46.507 --> 00:35:48.147
Going downstairs?
- To the bar.


339
00:35:48.347 --> 00:35:49.827
The bar's closed.

340
00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:53.907
Come to my room. We were
just about to open some port.


341
00:35:55.426 --> 00:35:57.866
Yes, come in. Just for a minute.
Please do.


342
00:36:06.986 --> 00:36:08.425
Do come in.

343
00:36:13.545 --> 00:36:16.505
My dear,
allow me to introduce Mr. -


344
00:36:16.705 --> 00:36:18.425
Francois de Richemont.

345
00:36:18.785 --> 00:36:20.865
- Miss Rosenblum.
- Pleased to meet you.


346
00:36:22.024 --> 00:36:23.224
The pleasure's mine.

347
00:36:23.464 --> 00:36:24.864
My name is Jean Bermans.

348
00:36:27.264 --> 00:36:28.544
Do sit down.

349
00:36:31.704 --> 00:36:33.464
Are you from Paris?

350
00:36:33.664 --> 00:36:34.983
Yes. Are you?

351
00:36:35.183 --> 00:36:39.183
No, l'm a hatter from Nimes.
Miss Rosenblum is my associate.


352
00:36:40.223 --> 00:36:41.743
Are you in business too?

353
00:36:41.943 --> 00:36:44.823
- No, l'm a student.
- What are you studying?


354
00:36:45.223 --> 00:36:46.663
l'm graduating high school.

355
00:36:46.863 --> 00:36:48.462
Lucky young fellow.

356
00:36:48.662 --> 00:36:51.422
l have fond memories
of my student days.


357
00:36:51.782 --> 00:36:55.142
lf only l could have gone to college.
But in Ostend, you know -


358
00:36:55.942 --> 00:36:57.062
Are you here alone?

359
00:36:57.262 --> 00:36:58.742
No, l'm with -

360
00:36:59.262 --> 00:37:00.782
my mother.

361
00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:03.621
Perhaps she'd care to join us.

362
00:37:03.941 --> 00:37:05.381
l don't think so.

363
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:07.021
She's not feeling well.

364
00:37:08.261 --> 00:37:09.581
One moment.

365
00:37:14.021 --> 00:37:16.660
l'm sorry, but l heard voices.
l'm looking for matches.


366
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.940
Come in.
Sit down for a minute.


367
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.340
Yes, but...
l'm with four gentlemen.


368
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.860
Four gentlemen?

369
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.780
We might invite them in too.

370
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.779
That would be lovely.

371
00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:32.139
Will you show me to your room?

372
00:37:32.339 --> 00:37:34.539
- Yes, but -
- Come.


373
00:37:35.139 --> 00:37:37.259
Which door?
- That one.


374
00:37:44.618 --> 00:37:46.698
She didn't tell me
the gentlemen were -


375
00:37:47.178 --> 00:37:49.058
But it's no problem.
On the contrary.


376
00:37:49.898 --> 00:37:51.258
Jean Bermans.

377
00:37:51.498 --> 00:37:56.057
Gentlemen, l'd be honored if you'd come
have some port in my room.


378
00:37:56.257 --> 00:37:57.217
ln your room?

379
00:37:57.417 --> 00:38:01.457
- That's very kind of you, but -
- l'd be so pleased.


380
00:38:01.657 --> 00:38:03.737
lt's late. We were going to bed.

381
00:38:03.937 --> 00:38:06.737
We must celebrate the chance
that brought us together.


382
00:38:06.937 --> 00:38:10.256
- Celebrate what?
- Chance. Come along.


383
00:38:10.536 --> 00:38:12.176
Come along, please.

384
00:38:17.936 --> 00:38:19.296
This way.

385
00:38:27.855 --> 00:38:29.895
After you.

386
00:38:35.614 --> 00:38:36.854
Please go in.

387
00:38:39.294 --> 00:38:40.894
You must be Dominicans?

388
00:38:41.094 --> 00:38:43.214
- No, Carmelites.
- That's a relief.


389
00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:53.293
My dear Edith,
isn't this a stroke of luck?


390
00:38:53.493 --> 00:38:56.693
This is Miss Rosenblum.
- Pleased to meet you.


391
00:38:56.893 --> 00:38:58.893
Edith, pour us some port, will you?

392
00:38:59.093 --> 00:39:01.452
Mr. de Richemont,
will you give me a hand?


393
00:39:01.932 --> 00:39:05.772
lt's a bit cramped in here, but no matter.
We love these little impromptus.


394
00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:11.412
We're going to have a charming time,
if you have no objections.


395
00:39:11.772 --> 00:39:13.132
Excuse me.

396
00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:18.491
Mr. Bermans,
haven't we met before?


397
00:39:18.691 --> 00:39:19.691
l don't think so.

398
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:22.291
You never lived in the Congo?

399
00:39:22.491 --> 00:39:23.411
The Belgian Congo.

400
00:39:23.611 --> 00:39:26.491
- l've never been to Africa. Why?
- No reason.


401
00:39:27.051 --> 00:39:29.370
- The weather's improving.
- lt's about time.


402
00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.050
Personally, l love Africa.

403
00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:46.609
St. Christopher was never
any help to me.


404
00:39:46.809 --> 00:39:49.249
- Naturally, madam.
- Why's that?


405
00:39:49.449 --> 00:39:52.729
He's no longer a saint.
Nor are St. George and some others.


406
00:39:52.929 --> 00:39:56.528
The church has become very strict
about sainthood.


407
00:39:57.088 --> 00:39:59.488
But isn't that damaging to the faith?

408
00:39:59.688 --> 00:40:02.048
On the contrary. lt reinforces it.

409
00:40:02.248 --> 00:40:04.728
Sainthood isn't like some badge.

410
00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:22.686
You've no doubt heard of Savonarola?

411
00:40:22.886 --> 00:40:26.926
- Wasn't he a Dominican?
- lndeed, and an illustrious one.


412
00:40:27.126 --> 00:40:30.006
Savonarola was tried
and condemned as a heretic.


413
00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:32.646
He's completely rehabilitated now.

414
00:40:33.126 --> 00:40:35.605
Soon he may even be sanctified.

415
00:40:35.805 --> 00:40:37.925
While other saints will disappear?

416
00:40:38.125 --> 00:40:40.605
Yes, it appears that
St. Therese of Lisieux -


417
00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:42.565
St. Therese?

418
00:40:42.765 --> 00:40:44.045
How could they?

419
00:40:44.245 --> 00:40:46.925
That's the rumor going around Rome.

420
00:40:56.444 --> 00:41:00.563
We now know that Theresa's parents
had a hereditary disease


421
00:41:00.763 --> 00:41:04.563
when she and her many brothers
and sisters were conceived.


422
00:41:05.283 --> 00:41:07.323
What will become of the basilica?

423
00:41:07.523 --> 00:41:10.363
A church like all the others.

424
00:41:10.563 --> 00:41:12.643
And the Virgin of Lourdes?
Same thing?


425
00:41:12.843 --> 00:41:16.842
No. There never was a real miracle
at Lisieux, whereas in Lourdes -


426
00:41:17.042 --> 00:41:19.522
Go on, beat me, you old slut!

427
00:41:19.802 --> 00:41:22.202
Harder! Again! That's it!

428
00:41:22.642 --> 00:41:24.242
Harder!

429
00:41:24.442 --> 00:41:25.722
l'm a swine!

430
00:41:25.922 --> 00:41:27.521
l'm filth!

431
00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:30.481
Beat me, you filthy trollop!

432
00:41:32.401 --> 00:41:34.081
l'm foul!

433
00:41:34.321 --> 00:41:35.201
A leper!

434
00:41:35.921 --> 00:41:36.961
Again!

435
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.041
No, wait! Don't go!

436
00:41:39.281 --> 00:41:41.680
Let the monks stay, at least!

437
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.560
- Allow me, ma'am.
- Yes, take him.


438
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.360
Thank you for your hospitality.

439
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.119
lf it's the cane he wants,
l'll give it to him!


440
00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:57.119
Calm down, Father!

441
00:41:57.919 --> 00:41:59.119
You must rest up.

442
00:41:59.319 --> 00:42:01.479
This way.

443
00:42:37.636 --> 00:42:38.876
Come.

444
00:42:49.675 --> 00:42:51.355
Do what you want with me!

445
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:56.070
You're the first one up.

446
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.870
- ls the phone working?
- Not yet, but the Argenton road's open.


447
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.990
- ls my bill ready?
- Of course.


448
00:44:07.989 --> 00:44:10.509
Excuse me.
Are you going to Argenton?


449
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:14.069
Can you give me a lift?
The bus isn't due for two hours.


450
00:44:14.269 --> 00:44:16.709
- l'd be glad to.
- Thank you.


451
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:18.829
Here you are.

452
00:44:25.988 --> 00:44:27.708
Do you need the bill?

453
00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:32.588
Allow me.

454
00:44:54.466 --> 00:44:56.746
l'll tell you where to drop me off.

455
00:46:20.779 --> 00:46:21.939
Here he comes!

456
00:46:22.139 --> 00:46:25.299
Look out, he's coming!
Take your seats.


457
00:46:42.898 --> 00:46:44.018
Be seated.

458
00:46:51.297 --> 00:46:54.137
THE COLONEL lS A CUCKOLD
THE CAPTAlN lS A PANSY


459
00:47:05.336 --> 00:47:06.816
Who wrote this?

460
00:47:08.456 --> 00:47:10.096
l repeat: Who wrote this?

461
00:47:12.456 --> 00:47:13.855
You won't answer?

462
00:47:15.775 --> 00:47:17.855
Then l'll have to report it.

463
00:47:18.295 --> 00:47:19.815
lt's incredible.

464
00:47:20.575 --> 00:47:22.975
At your age,
you still act like children.


465
00:47:23.815 --> 00:47:27.054
Duval, erase that.
And close the door.


466
00:47:32.654 --> 00:47:35.414
We were discussing,
in our last class,


467
00:47:35.614 --> 00:47:38.254
the notion of laws

468
00:47:38.734 --> 00:47:40.773
and misdemeanors.

469
00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:45.853
We saw how the aim of laws

470
00:47:46.053 --> 00:47:48.973
is to maintain social order.

471
00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:52.532
Naturally, they're subject to change

472
00:47:52.772 --> 00:47:55.732
from one country to another,
from one age to another.


473
00:47:56.212 --> 00:47:59.812
ln fact,
they are merely conventions.


474
00:48:01.092 --> 00:48:04.612
The same goes
for customs and morals.


475
00:48:05.012 --> 00:48:08.091
Take polygamy, for example -

476
00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:09.651
Target practice!

477
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:11.251
Group 3!

478
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:27.850
As l was saying,

479
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.450
morals are subject to change

480
00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.169
like laws.

481
00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:37.409
So, polygamy...

482
00:48:38.609 --> 00:48:41.609
which is the norm in some societies,

483
00:48:42.009 --> 00:48:43.569
is taboo in ours.

484
00:48:44.529 --> 00:48:49.568
On this subject, l refer you
to Margaret Mead's works -


485
00:48:49.768 --> 00:48:55.288
l repeat: Mead, M
-E
-A
-D -

486
00:48:55.888 --> 00:48:58.648
on sexual practices in Melanesia.

487
00:48:59.447 --> 00:49:00.807
These books -

488
00:49:08.527 --> 00:49:11.687
l'm not starting over for latecomers.

489
00:49:12.526 --> 00:49:15.086
l was talking about the works
of Margaret Mead


490
00:49:15.606 --> 00:49:18.606
on sexual practices in Melanesia.

491
00:49:19.406 --> 00:49:21.006
l was saying that these works -

492
00:49:21.326 --> 00:49:24.046
Accident on highway 767!

493
00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:39.244
With all these comings and goings,
l lost the thread.


494
00:49:40.004 --> 00:49:45.124
Ah, l was saying that these works,
which are in the barracks library,


495
00:49:45.324 --> 00:49:49.684
will help you better understand
the relativity of customs


496
00:49:49.884 --> 00:49:52.003
and, consequently, of laws.

497
00:49:54.003 --> 00:49:58.203
When you compare one culture
to another,


498
00:49:58.403 --> 00:50:00.603
it's all a question of viewpoint.

499
00:50:00.803 --> 00:50:03.163
Everyone is always
someone else's barbarian.


500
00:50:03.363 --> 00:50:05.163
What's more,

501
00:50:05.362 --> 00:50:07.202
as far as the relativity

502
00:50:08.002 --> 00:50:10.842
of customs and laws is concerned -

503
00:50:11.202 --> 00:50:12.962
The gasworks just blew up!

504
00:50:13.202 --> 00:50:14.402
General alarm!

505
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.360
Aren't you going with the others?

506
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.520
- We're on arctal ructive duty.
- On what?


507
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.080
Arctal ructive duty.

508
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.800
l see. And you?

509
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.159
- Me, too.
- Very well.


510
00:50:53.559 --> 00:50:55.959
With all these interruptions...

511
00:50:56.359 --> 00:50:57.759
l lost the thread.

512
00:51:07.358 --> 00:51:10.198
l think that everything
l just explained to you


513
00:51:10.678 --> 00:51:13.957
will help you better understand
the relativity


514
00:51:14.597 --> 00:51:16.477
of customs and laws.

515
00:51:16.997 --> 00:51:21.317
You're well aware that it's often
a question of changing the laws.


516
00:51:26.796 --> 00:51:30.076
We also hear a lot about an evolution

517
00:51:30.356 --> 00:51:32.796
that is leading to changes in customs

518
00:51:32.996 --> 00:51:34.036
and morals.

519
00:51:59.154 --> 00:52:01.074
Hey, look at this.

520
00:52:07.433 --> 00:52:09.633
RED DAlLY
Workers Sound the Alarm!


521
00:52:11.353 --> 00:52:12.953
Attention!

522
00:52:19.112 --> 00:52:20.952
- Colonel.
- Go ahead.


523
00:52:24.952 --> 00:52:29.032
l was told the class
was a bit restless today. We'll see.


524
00:52:29.592 --> 00:52:30.552
Sit down.

525
00:52:39.071 --> 00:52:40.631
Carry on.

526
00:52:44.271 --> 00:52:47.510
There's a good deal of talk
about changing our morals.


527
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:51.790
Some people are even calling
for a general upheaval.


528
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:58.829
But the consequences of such
a disturbance could prove intolerable,


529
00:52:59.029 --> 00:53:00.589
even horrifying.

530
00:53:01.269 --> 00:53:03.829
l'll pick an example at random.

531
00:53:04.029 --> 00:53:06.629
My wife and l are invited
over to some friends...


532
00:53:23.668 --> 00:53:27.467
- We thought you'd never make it.
- You can't imagine the traffic.


533
00:53:27.667 --> 00:53:29.067
We nearly began without you.

534
00:53:29.267 --> 00:53:31.627
- You should have.
- You're not serious!


535
00:53:31.827 --> 00:53:33.227
Why, here's Sophie!

536
00:53:33.467 --> 00:53:35.347
Sweetheart, how are you?

537
00:53:36.347 --> 00:53:38.746
How you've grown!
Everything fine at school?


538
00:53:41.586 --> 00:53:43.226
You know Mrs. Calmette.

539
00:53:46.746 --> 00:53:49.666
lf you'll just follow me...

540
00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:53.265
Let's see.

541
00:53:53.465 --> 00:53:56.945
Mrs. Calmette, you sit there.

542
00:53:57.665 --> 00:53:59.265
Elizabeth, here.

543
00:53:59.465 --> 00:54:01.385
You, Professor, at my right.

544
00:54:01.665 --> 00:54:04.145
Charles, between Elizabeth
and Mrs. Calmette.


545
00:54:04.344 --> 00:54:06.624
And you, Sophie darling,

546
00:54:06.824 --> 00:54:08.424
sit on my left.

547
00:54:08.624 --> 00:54:10.224
Do sit down.

548
00:54:18.863 --> 00:54:21.903
We went to see Tristan and lsolde
the other day.


549
00:54:22.063 --> 00:54:23.543
- Was it good?
- Splendid.


550
00:54:23.743 --> 00:54:28.503
Carlotta lgellicci was heartrending.
What a voice! What presence!


551
00:54:28.863 --> 00:54:31.102
lt's a shame she's put on weight.

552
00:54:32.822 --> 00:54:34.542
Care for a cigarette?

553
00:54:34.862 --> 00:54:36.222
l'd love one, thanks.

554
00:54:37.502 --> 00:54:40.462
- How was your trip to Spain?
- lnteresting.


555
00:54:40.822 --> 00:54:42.222
But -
- But?


556
00:54:42.422 --> 00:54:43.862
We had to come home early.

557
00:54:44.062 --> 00:54:47.021
Madrid was filled with the stench of -

558
00:54:47.301 --> 00:54:48.541
pardon my language -

559
00:54:48.741 --> 00:54:50.261
food.

560
00:54:50.861 --> 00:54:53.021
lt was indecent.

561
00:54:53.221 --> 00:54:58.260
What will our planet be like in 20 years
with the current population explosion?


562
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.140
lt makes you think.

563
00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.700
What are you referring to?

564
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.860
Consider the quantity of toxic products
we dump into our rivers.


565
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.260
lnsecticides, detergents,

566
00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.339
all the industrial residue.

567
00:55:12.539 --> 00:55:15.899
- Not to mention bodily wastes.
- Of course.


568
00:55:16.099 --> 00:55:19.899
There are almost
four billion people on earth.


569
00:55:20.139 --> 00:55:22.219
ln 20 years there'll be
seven billion of us.


570
00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:23.819
Seven billion!

571
00:55:25.138 --> 00:55:28.738
And how much bodily waste
do you think a person discharges daily?


572
00:55:30.658 --> 00:55:33.338
l don't know.
Half a pound, maybe?


573
00:55:33.538 --> 00:55:35.458
Much more!

574
00:55:35.658 --> 00:55:37.737
Urine is heavier than water.

575
00:55:37.937 --> 00:55:41.017
All told, l'd say
at least three pounds.


576
00:55:41.217 --> 00:55:43.337
Multiplied by four billion,

577
00:55:43.497 --> 00:55:45.337
that makes more than

578
00:55:45.537 --> 00:55:47.897
ln 20 years,
more than 22 billion pounds!


579
00:55:48.257 --> 00:55:51.016
- Ten million tons of excrement a day?
- Exactly.


580
00:55:51.176 --> 00:55:52.456
My word!

581
00:55:53.136 --> 00:55:55.576
That's really alarming!

582
00:55:57.896 --> 00:55:59.176
How many tons did you say?

583
00:55:59.936 --> 00:56:02.056
More than 10 million tons a day.

584
00:56:03.656 --> 00:56:06.055
And such waste is extremely toxic.

585
00:56:06.255 --> 00:56:09.855
lts damaging effect is increased
by the presence of chemicals.


586
00:56:10.335 --> 00:56:14.175
Just try peeing
into your fish tank every day


587
00:56:14.375 --> 00:56:15.695
and you'll understand.

588
00:56:18.054 --> 00:56:19.974
Mommy, l'm really hungry.

589
00:56:20.414 --> 00:56:23.014
Sophie, it's bad manners
to talk like that at the table!


590
00:56:26.614 --> 00:56:28.294
Excuse me a moment.

591
00:56:31.053 --> 00:56:32.613
Where's the dining room, please?

592
00:56:32.813 --> 00:56:34.853
Last door on the right.

593
00:57:27.649 --> 00:57:28.449
lt's occupied!

594
00:57:28.649 --> 00:57:30.209
Sorry!

595
00:57:38.008 --> 00:57:38.968
What is it?

596
00:57:39.168 --> 00:57:41.888
Colonel, we go on duty
at 1 1 :00 a.m.

597
00:57:43.128 --> 00:57:44.328
Go ahead then.

598
00:58:38.484 --> 00:58:40.364
Driver's license and registration.

599
00:58:47.003 --> 00:58:50.123
- Don't you know the speed limit?
- l was doing under 40.


600
00:58:50.323 --> 00:58:51.483
Really?

601
00:58:52.523 --> 00:58:54.043
And the seat belt is compulsory.

602
00:58:54.243 --> 00:58:56.363
l know. l wasn't thinking.

603
00:59:06.602 --> 00:59:08.482
Have you seen your tires?

604
00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:12.881
You're not only endangering
your own life


605
00:59:13.281 --> 00:59:15.081
but that of other drivers.

606
00:59:15.321 --> 00:59:17.601
l have a doctor's appointment in Paris.

607
00:59:17.801 --> 00:59:19.561
Are you kidding me?

608
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:25.480
Consider yourself lucky
l don't impound your car.


609
00:59:37.999 --> 00:59:40.679
Richard, how are you feeling,
old man?


610
00:59:40.879 --> 00:59:42.319
No better, no worse.

611
00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:45.879
- And your wife and little girl?
- Fine, thank you.


612
00:59:46.199 --> 00:59:48.879
You must come over
for dinner some evening.


613
00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:50.678
We'd like that.

614
00:59:59.958 --> 01:00:01.118
Sit down.

615
01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:04.917
Did you bring the test results?

616
01:00:06.877 --> 01:00:08.117
Let's have a look.

617
01:00:11.237 --> 01:00:12.757
Glucose: 130.

618
01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:14.757
Cholesterol, fine.

619
01:00:15.117 --> 01:00:16.916
Uric acid... urea...

620
01:00:17.276 --> 01:00:18.476
good.

621
01:00:26.396 --> 01:00:27.556
Very good.

622
01:00:28.596 --> 01:00:32.035
Your results are better than mine.
Now for the electrocardiogram.


623
01:00:38.995 --> 01:00:40.795
Normal.

624
01:00:41.395 --> 01:00:43.154
You smoke a lot?
- A pack a day.


625
01:00:43.354 --> 01:00:44.754
Too much.

626
01:00:46.034 --> 01:00:47.754
And you lead a hectic life.

627
01:00:47.954 --> 01:00:52.474
Keep it up and in three or four years
you'll end up in a wheelchair.


628
01:00:53.514 --> 01:00:55.034
Let's look at the X rays.

629
01:01:08.113 --> 01:01:10.552
This area here is clear, see?

630
01:01:10.832 --> 01:01:12.632
There's a small spot here.

631
01:01:12.992 --> 01:01:15.632
We could take another X ray
to be sure.


632
01:01:16.032 --> 01:01:17.872
And those white spots?

633
01:01:18.072 --> 01:01:19.712
Oh, nothing.

634
01:01:20.712 --> 01:01:25.591
Catherine met your wife the other day.
So you're not going south this summer?


635
01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:28.471
lf l'm not feeling well,
we'll stay in Paris.


636
01:01:31.671 --> 01:01:33.791
All right. Well?

637
01:01:35.951 --> 01:01:37.030
One thing.

638
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:40.110
l'd like to make a small incision.

639
01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.270
Sheer medical curiosity.

640
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:44.590
- Big?
- This long.


641
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:47.790
ls it an operation?

642
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:49.509
Just to see.

643
01:01:50.709 --> 01:01:51.389
When?

644
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:53.709
Whenever you want.
When you have time.


645
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:57.549
ls tomorrow okay with you?

646
01:01:59.589 --> 01:02:01.309
Tomorrow? ls it that urgent?

647
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:04.468
lt's always best to do these things
as soon as possible.


648
01:02:05.268 --> 01:02:06.068
What's wrong?

649
01:02:06.468 --> 01:02:07.948
lt's up to you,

650
01:02:08.148 --> 01:02:11.188
but personally,
l'd like to have a look.


651
01:02:18.147 --> 01:02:19.787
Look, Pierre,

652
01:02:20.067 --> 01:02:21.667
l'm not a child anymore.

653
01:02:21.987 --> 01:02:24.747
lf it's something serious,
you can tell me.


654
01:02:25.027 --> 01:02:26.667
l like patients like you.

655
01:02:28.267 --> 01:02:29.906
You have a neoplasm.

656
01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:35.306
l see.

657
01:02:39.346 --> 01:02:40.386
What's that?

658
01:02:40.586 --> 01:02:42.785
A growth of new tissue.

659
01:02:43.145 --> 01:02:45.185
Or, if you prefer, cancer.

660
01:02:46.025 --> 01:02:47.225
What?

661
01:02:47.825 --> 01:02:49.825
You have cancer of the liver.

662
01:02:52.825 --> 01:02:54.505
Cancer, me?

663
01:02:54.705 --> 01:02:56.824
At a fairly advanced stage.

664
01:03:07.864 --> 01:03:09.703
But nowadays, you know,

665
01:03:10.103 --> 01:03:11.463
these things...

666
01:03:12.263 --> 01:03:13.623
Cigarette?

667
01:04:11.819 --> 01:04:13.779
What did Dr. Pasolini say?

668
01:04:14.339 --> 01:04:15.419
lt's nothing.

669
01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:16.858
Oh, good.

670
01:04:17.098 --> 01:04:18.378
That's a relief.

671
01:04:19.698 --> 01:04:21.418
l was a bit worried, you know.

672
01:04:24.258 --> 01:04:26.978
Did he start you on treatment?
- No, nothing.


673
01:04:28.578 --> 01:04:30.057
lsn't Aliette here?

674
01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:32.217
She's at school now.

675
01:04:40.697 --> 01:04:42.256
Yes, speaking.

676
01:04:43.736 --> 01:04:45.336
What did you say?

677
01:04:47.336 --> 01:04:49.056
When? How?

678
01:04:49.856 --> 01:04:51.296
That's impossible.

679
01:04:53.096 --> 01:04:54.776
We'll be right over.

680
01:04:55.535 --> 01:04:57.855
- What is it?
- Aliette's disappeared.


681
01:04:58.055 --> 01:05:00.295
- What?
- She's disappeared from school.


682
01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:03.615
There must be an explanation.
Did the nanny take her?


683
01:05:04.135 --> 01:05:06.735
Yes. She just got back.
She didn't say a thing.


684
01:05:14.054 --> 01:05:15.574
Brigitte!

685
01:05:23.213 --> 01:05:25.613
Exactly what happened?

686
01:05:25.813 --> 01:05:27.973
l don't know.
We don't understand it.


687
01:05:28.253 --> 01:05:31.293
- You're sure she's disappeared?
- l don't know.


688
01:05:31.773 --> 01:05:33.413
What makes it so odd

689
01:05:33.813 --> 01:05:38.132
is that she and the others
were under constant supervision.


690
01:05:38.812 --> 01:05:40.212
And she was always there.

691
01:05:40.572 --> 01:05:42.212
Come with me. l'll show you.

692
01:05:51.211 --> 01:05:53.531
"Will we see him...

693
01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.211
come back?''

694
01:06:00.811 --> 01:06:03.210
This is Mr. and Mrs. Legendre,
Aliette's parents.


695
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:08.890
When the children came into class,
the teacher counted them.


696
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:12.650
There were 22 girls, as usual.

697
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:17.409
Five minutes later,
she noticed Aliette wasn't there.


698
01:06:17.609 --> 01:06:18.969
She called me right away.

699
01:06:21.089 --> 01:06:23.489
- Could she have run away?
- lmpossible.


700
01:06:23.729 --> 01:06:26.529
The concierge was categorical:
No pupil left.


701
01:06:26.729 --> 01:06:29.088
lt's incredible.
lsn't anyone in charge?


702
01:06:29.648 --> 01:06:31.408
Sit down.

703
01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:35.968
l counted them too.

704
01:06:36.648 --> 01:06:39.528
l took the enrollment list
and called the roll.


705
01:06:40.448 --> 01:06:41.927
l've lost faith in this school.

706
01:06:42.127 --> 01:06:44.647
- Mommy.
- Be quiet. What do you want?


707
01:06:44.847 --> 01:06:46.327
l'm here.

708
01:06:47.007 --> 01:06:50.447
Be quiet when the headmistress
is talking. Understand?


709
01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:52.847
Now go back to your seat.

710
01:06:53.607 --> 01:06:55.966
l'll call the roll for you.
You'll see.


711
01:07:08.405 --> 01:07:09.685
Legendre, Aliette.

712
01:07:09.885 --> 01:07:11.245
Here.

713
01:07:14.165 --> 01:07:15.965
You see? She's there.

714
01:07:16.205 --> 01:07:17.525
And all the others are there?

715
01:07:17.725 --> 01:07:19.405
All of them. l checked.

716
01:07:19.605 --> 01:07:21.125
You looked everywhere?

717
01:07:21.325 --> 01:07:23.604
We searched the entire school.
Nothing.


718
01:07:23.844 --> 01:07:27.204
Good Lord!
What could have happened to her?


719
01:07:27.404 --> 01:07:32.124
lf you think we'll accept
your feeble explanation, you're wrong.


720
01:07:33.764 --> 01:07:35.963
We must notify the police at once.

721
01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.323
- Where's your coat?
- ln the hall.


722
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:04.561
Show them in.

723
01:08:10.641 --> 01:08:12.161
Please come in.

724
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.320
Do sit down.

725
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.840
You are Mr. Legendre?

726
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.480
Yes. Thanks for seeing us
so quickly.


727
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.280
Not at all.
What can l do for you?


728
01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.559
- Our daughter has disappeared.
- When?


729
01:08:30.879 --> 01:08:33.919
About an hour ago,
when she got to school.


730
01:08:34.159 --> 01:08:35.719
The nanny took her as usual.

731
01:08:35.919 --> 01:08:38.999
When the teacher called the roll,
she was there.


732
01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:42.358
They searched the entire school,
but obviously they didn't find her.


733
01:08:43.438 --> 01:08:46.558
Do you have any enemies?
Anyone who would wish you harm?


734
01:08:47.598 --> 01:08:49.198
l don't think so.

735
01:08:49.998 --> 01:08:52.158
You're a man who's fairly -

736
01:08:53.118 --> 01:08:55.437
l mean, if it's a kidnapping,

737
01:08:55.597 --> 01:08:57.917
do you have the means
to pay a ransom?


738
01:08:58.837 --> 01:09:00.357
Yes, of course.

739
01:09:00.557 --> 01:09:02.877
l see. ls there a witness?

740
01:09:03.157 --> 01:09:04.277
The nanny.

741
01:09:04.477 --> 01:09:06.797
You took this child to school?

742
01:09:07.637 --> 01:09:12.796
Yes, sir. But l don't know a thing.
lt wasn't me.


743
01:09:13.036 --> 01:09:16.716
l left her at the gate,
like l always do. Didn't l, Aliette?


744
01:09:17.476 --> 01:09:19.596
That's right.
lt was like every day.


745
01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:21.595
She left me at the gate.

746
01:09:21.995 --> 01:09:24.235
You'll speak when you're questioned.

747
01:09:26.475 --> 01:09:29.795
First we'll fill out
a missing persons form.


748
01:09:30.995 --> 01:09:33.475
You did well to bring her.
lt helps.


749
01:09:33.675 --> 01:09:35.194
Come here, child.

750
01:09:40.674 --> 01:09:42.474
Now then...

751
01:09:43.354 --> 01:09:45.674
Legendre. Your first name?

752
01:09:47.873 --> 01:09:50.393
Race... white.

753
01:09:51.913 --> 01:09:54.433
- Age?
- Eight and a half.


754
01:09:55.113 --> 01:09:57.833
Marital status... single.

755
01:09:59.353 --> 01:10:01.712
Brown eyes.

756
01:10:02.472 --> 01:10:04.672
Auburn hair.

757
01:10:05.192 --> 01:10:06.832
Height?

758
01:10:07.992 --> 01:10:09.232
3'6''.

759
01:10:09.432 --> 01:10:10.792
Weight?

760
01:10:11.592 --> 01:10:12.872
Fifty-five pounds.

761
01:10:13.512 --> 01:10:15.951
Wearing a blue coat,
black shoes, white socks.


762
01:10:16.151 --> 01:10:18.711
Ask the sergeant to come in.

763
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:31.830
lssue an all-points bulletin for Paris.
We must find this child.


764
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.870
- This her?
- Yes, why?


765
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:38.230
- Can't we take her along?
- No need.


766
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:41.229
Just take a good look at her,
then get to work.


767
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:54.508
Sergeant,
your shoes are far from spotless!


768
01:10:55.388 --> 01:10:57.788
You're right. l didn't have time to -

769
01:10:59.948 --> 01:11:03.708
So there's no need to worry.
We're pulling out all the stops.


770
01:11:03.908 --> 01:11:07.787
Contact us if you hear anything,
even if you're warned against it.


771
01:11:07.987 --> 01:11:08.747
Count on me.

772
01:11:08.947 --> 01:11:10.907
- Thank you, lnspector.
- Don't mention it.


773
01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:48.464
A fine-looking dog you have.

774
01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:52.704
You keep him tied up all day?
- l let him run free from time to time.


775
01:11:53.224 --> 01:11:54.544
With all this traffic?

776
01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:56.224
He's used to it.

777
01:11:57.864 --> 01:11:59.944
- What's his name?
- Chico.


778
01:12:01.503 --> 01:12:02.983
Good boy!

779
01:12:03.503 --> 01:12:07.383
The bastards who mistreat animals
should be drowned.


780
01:12:08.143 --> 01:12:10.743
That's what the Gospel says...
more or less.


781
01:14:02.014 --> 01:14:02.974
What's the matter?

782
01:16:03.885 --> 01:16:05.325
There he is!

783
01:16:06.525 --> 01:16:08.525
lt's him.

784
01:16:09.445 --> 01:16:11.885
The open window on the top floor.
l'll call in.


785
01:17:28.799 --> 01:17:30.199
Court is in session.

786
01:17:47.637 --> 01:17:48.917
The defendant will rise.

787
01:17:49.757 --> 01:17:50.957
All right, all right.

788
01:17:54.717 --> 01:17:57.077
Here are the judgments
on the charges


789
01:17:57.437 --> 01:17:59.916
and the verdict.

790
01:18:01.356 --> 01:18:05.556
On the charge of first-degree murder

791
01:18:05.756 --> 01:18:07.516
the jury replied guilty,

792
01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:10.196
by a majority
of at least eight votes.


793
01:18:12.356 --> 01:18:15.715
As to extenuating circumstances,
the jury found none,


794
01:18:16.355 --> 01:18:18.555
by a majority
of at least eight votes.


795
01:18:20.795 --> 01:18:22.395
Under Articles 295,

796

and Article 12 of the Penal Code,
the court,


798

01:18:31.314 --> 01:18:33.914
sentences Bernard Levasseur

800
01:18:34.154 --> 01:18:35.394
to death.

801
01:18:39.193 --> 01:18:40.833
Court is adjourned.

802
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:45.868
May l have your autograph?

803
01:19:50.628 --> 01:19:52.108
Me too.

804
01:19:54.268 --> 01:19:56.148
The trial of the killer poet

805
01:19:56.348 --> 01:19:58.268
lasted 1 4 months.

806
01:19:58.588 --> 01:20:01.667
Meanwhile, the search
for the little girl continued.


807
01:20:02.467 --> 01:20:03.747
Then, one day...

808
01:20:10.947 --> 01:20:13.026
Mr. Commissioner,
Mr. Legendre is here.


809
01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:14.426
Show him in.

810
01:20:20.346 --> 01:20:22.666
- Mr. Commissioner.
- Sit down.


811
01:20:27.745 --> 01:20:30.785
After all this time,
you may have started losing hope.


812
01:20:30.985 --> 01:20:32.985
l have good news at last.

813
01:20:33.185 --> 01:20:35.025
You did it!
l don't believe it.


814
01:20:36.585 --> 01:20:38.145
Bring her in.

815
01:20:47.064 --> 01:20:48.344
Sit down, madam.

816
01:20:51.464 --> 01:20:54.143
- l waited two hours for you.
- l couldn't help it.


817
01:20:54.343 --> 01:20:56.263
- Why didn't you phone?
- l couldn't.


818
01:20:56.983 --> 01:20:59.823
Commissioner,
l don't know how to thank you.


819
01:21:00.103 --> 01:21:01.623
Was she well treated?

820
01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:03.583
She had everything she needed,
didn't she?


821
01:21:03.783 --> 01:21:06.422
Everything. As usual.

822
01:21:06.622 --> 01:21:08.062
How did you find her?

823
01:21:08.702 --> 01:21:11.222
l have the written statement.
l'll read it.


824
01:21:12.022 --> 01:21:13.902
lt's a rather unusual story.

825
01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:17.422
"On the night of February 7,
the population of Lisieux


826
01:21:17.622 --> 01:21:20.621
was awakened
by a deafening explosion.


827
01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:26.221
When rescue workers arrived,
they were amazed to find -''


828
01:21:28.941 --> 01:21:30.581
1 :30 already?

829
01:21:30.741 --> 01:21:33.100
l'm sorry.
l have an urgent appointment.


830
01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.180
Go ahead.

831
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.620
My secretary will read it to you.
Do you mind, Jacqueline?


832
01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.260
Good-bye and excuse me.

833
01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.820
Written statement:

834
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.819
"On the night of February 7,

835
01:21:46.019 --> 01:21:50.019
the population of Lisieux was awakened
by a deafening explosion.


836
01:21:50.579 --> 01:21:53.939
When rescue workers arrived,
they were amazed to find...''


837
01:22:01.498 --> 01:22:02.938
Shall l wait, sir?

838
01:22:03.138 --> 01:22:04.858
No, you're dismissed. Thank you.

839
01:22:24.337 --> 01:22:25.496
What?

840
01:22:25.936 --> 01:22:27.416
They're not here yet?

841
01:22:29.136 --> 01:22:30.896
But the appointment was for 1 :30.

842
01:22:31.056 --> 01:22:34.016
Listen,
turn off that music, will you?


843
01:22:34.736 --> 01:22:38.735
You can't go into a bar or restaurant
without hearing canned music.


844
01:22:38.895 --> 01:22:40.975
Turn it off, will you?
- Yes, sir.


845
01:22:49.815 --> 01:22:51.295
The usual?

846
01:22:52.014 --> 01:22:53.294
Of course.

847
01:23:12.653 --> 01:23:15.973
- Will you sit at the bar?
- No, l'll sit over there.


848
01:23:16.413 --> 01:23:18.252
l'll have a glass of port.

849
01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:48.610
l'm sorry to disturb you, but -

850
01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:51.210
Don't be afraid.

851
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:53.410
l'm the police commissioner.

852
01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:54.810
Pleased to meet you.

853
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:57.410
May l sit with you for a minute?

854
01:23:57.810 --> 01:23:59.209
Please do.

855
01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:03.609
Your port, ma'am.

856
01:24:03.889 --> 01:24:07.369
Your drink is at your table, sir.
- Leave it there.


857
01:24:09.049 --> 01:24:11.528
You come here often?
- This is my first time.


858
01:24:12.168 --> 01:24:14.528
l was troubled
when l saw you come in.


859
01:24:14.728 --> 01:24:17.488
May l tell you why?
- lf you wish.


860
01:24:18.088 --> 01:24:21.248
Today is the fourth anniversary
of my sister's death.


861
01:24:22.088 --> 01:24:23.888
l loved her deeply.

862
01:24:24.687 --> 01:24:28.127
She looked exactly like you.
l thought you were her.


863
01:24:28.607 --> 01:24:32.807
Same face, same voice, same walk.
Her name was Marguerite.


864
01:24:33.927 --> 01:24:35.607
My name is Estelle.

865
01:24:37.007 --> 01:24:38.486
One summer afternoon...

866
01:24:38.886 --> 01:24:41.606
it was unbearably hot.

867
01:25:13.764 --> 01:25:15.044
You still here?

868
01:25:15.244 --> 01:25:18.403
Didn't you have an appointment?
- lt's too hot to go.


869
01:25:18.603 --> 01:25:22.043
Too hot!
You'll never amount to anything!


870
01:26:14.679 --> 01:26:16.959
l don't think l'll go to Toulouse.

871
01:26:17.159 --> 01:26:18.679
l'm going to tell Mother.

872
01:26:19.159 --> 01:26:21.239
She'll be furious, but you're right.

873
01:26:21.439 --> 01:26:23.958
These family dinners:
the aunts and cousins -


874
01:26:24.438 --> 01:26:25.758
what a bore!

875
01:26:26.358 --> 01:26:27.718
l know.

876
01:26:27.918 --> 01:26:30.718
What would l do in Toulouse
at 3:00 p.m.?


877
01:26:31.278 --> 01:26:32.638
Take a nap.

878
01:26:35.998 --> 01:26:39.197
Do me a favor.
Play the Brahms Rhapsody.


879
01:26:39.357 --> 01:26:40.557
lf you like.

880
01:27:12.115 --> 01:27:14.235
She never did go to Toulouse.

881
01:27:15.035 --> 01:27:17.554
She died a few days later.

882
01:27:18.714 --> 01:27:20.354
Do you play piano, too?

883
01:27:20.554 --> 01:27:21.794
A little.

884
01:27:21.994 --> 01:27:24.954
- You're not French?
- l was born in ltaly.


885
01:27:25.594 --> 01:27:27.354
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.


886
01:27:27.514 --> 01:27:28.994
May l?

887
01:27:29.634 --> 01:27:31.633
What did your sister die of?

888
01:27:32.073 --> 01:27:34.033
The miserere colic.

889
01:27:34.233 --> 01:27:35.673
What is that?

890
01:27:35.873 --> 01:27:38.553
lt's horrible,
especially in the final stages.


891
01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:41.593
You end up vomiting excre-

892
01:27:41.753 --> 01:27:43.672
Excuse me.
- How awful.


893
01:27:43.832 --> 01:27:45.112
Horrible.

894
01:27:47.352 --> 01:27:49.112
l must be going,

895
01:27:49.272 --> 01:27:51.472
But it was extraordinary
meeting you like this.


896
01:27:51.712 --> 01:27:55.832
l'd like to see you again,
invite you to the Policemen's Ball.


897
01:27:56.032 --> 01:27:57.711
l'd love to go.

898
01:27:57.911 --> 01:28:00.031
A call for you, sir.

899
01:28:00.271 --> 01:28:03.151
- ls it Marcel saying he's late?
- l don't think so.


900
01:28:03.351 --> 01:28:05.191
No one else knows l'm here.

901
01:28:05.391 --> 01:28:07.471
Shall l say l haven't seen you?

902
01:28:07.671 --> 01:28:10.270
No. Ask who's calling.

903
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:14.310
Can't have a moment's peace.

904
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:16.670
Would you mind giving me
your name and address?


905
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:21.310
lt's your sister, 
Marguerite, sir.

906
01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:25.309
- What?
- She says she must speak to you.


907
01:28:26.269 --> 01:28:28.229
Georges, tell her to go screw herself.

908
01:28:28.949 --> 01:28:30.749
With your permission, madam.

909
01:28:31.549 --> 01:28:35.429
This must be a sick joke.
My sister's been dead for four years.


910
01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:37.948
But, sir...

911
01:28:38.268 --> 01:28:39.508
she insists.

912
01:28:39.708 --> 01:28:41.588
She wants to see you
tonight in the family vault.


913
01:28:41.788 --> 01:28:44.748
She says the key's
in your right-hand desk drawer.


914
01:28:45.548 --> 01:28:47.068
Why, that's true.

915
01:28:47.868 --> 01:28:49.148
Ask her

916
01:28:49.348 --> 01:28:52.787
what l requested she play
one hot summer day


917
01:28:53.347 --> 01:28:54.947
when l went in her room.

918
01:28:55.747 --> 01:29:00.107
The commissioner wants to know what
he asked you to play one hot summer day


919
01:29:00.307 --> 01:29:02.187
when he went in your room.

920
01:29:05.466 --> 01:29:07.706
The Brahms Rhapsody, sir.

921
01:29:15.666 --> 01:29:16.825
Give me that.

922
01:29:20.145 --> 01:29:21.785
Yes, speaking.
Who are you?


923
01:29:24.185 --> 01:29:26.785
Learn the true mystery
of death tonight?


924
01:29:57.782 --> 01:29:59.982
- What do you want?
- l want to come in.


925
01:30:00.302 --> 01:30:01.582
lt's closed.

926
01:30:01.782 --> 01:30:05.142
l'm Mr. Richepin.
My family vault is here. Let me in.


927
01:30:05.422 --> 01:30:07.422
You need a special authorization.

928
01:30:08.822 --> 01:30:11.021
l'm the police commissioner.

929
01:30:16.461 --> 01:30:18.981
Go in, then.
Shall l go with you?


930
01:30:19.181 --> 01:30:21.021
No need. Stay here.

931
01:32:00.373 --> 01:32:01.733
That's him!

932
01:32:04.413 --> 01:32:07.013
- What are you doing? Let go!
- Take him away!


933
01:32:07.213 --> 01:32:09.492
Don't you know who l am?

934
01:32:10.372 --> 01:32:12.492
Hands off!
l'm the police commissioner!


935
01:32:12.692 --> 01:32:16.092
- Explain it at the station.
- Let go, l said.


936
01:32:16.292 --> 01:32:19.092
Stand at attention
and give me your badge numbers!


937
01:32:51.609 --> 01:32:53.369
- The commissioner.
- Send him in.


938
01:33:08.848 --> 01:33:10.008
Sit down.

939
01:33:12.848 --> 01:33:16.367
l've been treated
in a most shameful manner.


940
01:33:16.647 --> 01:33:18.767
l couldn't even call my home.

941
01:33:20.687 --> 01:33:23.967
You were found last night
at the cemetery,


942
01:33:24.167 --> 01:33:26.327
desecrating a crypt.

943
01:33:26.527 --> 01:33:30.246
When arrested, you claimed
you were the police commissioner.


944
01:33:31.206 --> 01:33:33.526
You know full well l am.

945
01:33:34.406 --> 01:33:37.046
l order you to return
my belongings at once.


946
01:33:38.166 --> 01:33:40.886
And take me to my office.
You'll hear about this!


947
01:33:41.086 --> 01:33:42.166
Of course.

948
01:33:42.365 --> 01:33:46.325
As we were saying,
desecration of a crypt.


949
01:33:46.645 --> 01:33:48.405
lt was my sister's casket.

950
01:33:48.605 --> 01:33:50.045
Your sister?

951
01:33:51.165 --> 01:33:52.645
l went to see my sister.

952
01:33:53.085 --> 01:33:54.405
She phoned me!

953
01:33:55.844 --> 01:33:57.884
Back to his cell.

954
01:34:05.604 --> 01:34:08.244
Get me the police commissioner.
lt's urgent.


955
01:34:11.483 --> 01:34:13.123
Hello, Mr. Commissioner?

956
01:34:13.563 --> 01:34:16.363
Sorry to disturb you.
This is lnspector Dupuis.


957
01:34:17.163 --> 01:34:21.443
We've arrested a fellow who claims
to be the police commissioner.


958
01:34:22.242 --> 01:34:24.802
Claims to be the police commissioner?
How odd.


959
01:34:25.242 --> 01:34:27.122
Does he look like me?

960
01:34:27.602 --> 01:34:28.442
ls he pleasant?

961
01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:30.682
Not at all.

962
01:34:31.322 --> 01:34:32.522
l see.

963
01:34:32.722 --> 01:34:34.482
Bring him here right away.

964
01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.760
The commissioner will see you now.

965
01:35:17.598 --> 01:35:18.998
There you are.

966
01:35:19.158 --> 01:35:21.158
Come in. How are you?

967
01:35:21.358 --> 01:35:22.798
- Fine, and you?
- Fine, thanks.


968
01:35:24.278 --> 01:35:26.278
That will be all, lnspector.
Thank you.


969
01:35:28.598 --> 01:35:30.157
Won't you sit there?

970
01:35:30.797 --> 01:35:32.117
l'm fine here.

971
01:35:32.837 --> 01:35:36.437
Very well.
You there, and me here.


972
01:35:40.277 --> 01:35:41.837
Two glasses of scotch.

973
01:35:42.956 --> 01:35:45.316
You've put on weight.
- So have you.


974
01:35:45.836 --> 01:35:49.276
- All those official dinners.
- Always eating and drinking.


975
01:35:49.476 --> 01:35:51.476
We ought to refuse.
- Not easy.


976
01:35:51.676 --> 01:35:53.556
What are you doing this morning?

977
01:35:54.196 --> 01:35:57.875
- This morning, you know -
- Ah, yes, the zoo. At noon.


978
01:35:58.555 --> 01:36:00.675
l've taken precautions.

979
01:36:00.875 --> 01:36:03.755
l've stationed

980
01:36:03.955 --> 01:36:05.235
But not grouped together.

981
01:36:05.395 --> 01:36:07.475
Spread them out:
some here, some there.


982
01:36:07.675 --> 01:36:09.194
We mustn't alarm people.

983
01:36:09.714 --> 01:36:13.434
The main thing is to keep them
from reaching the cages.


984
01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:16.674
The locks have been
carefully checked.


985
01:36:16.874 --> 01:36:20.474
And anyway, if some animals
are killed, tough luck.


986
01:36:21.274 --> 01:36:24.073
Our men are more valuable
than a zebra.


987
01:36:28.073 --> 01:36:29.953
To your health.

988
01:37:36.148 --> 01:37:37.868
Down with liberty!

989
01:37:39.548 --> 01:37:41.587
- Charge!
- And let 'em have it!
