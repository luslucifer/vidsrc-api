1
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.742
The World War is lost.

2
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:37.033
Austria, once a proud, major power,

3
00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:39.700
is turning into a small,
insignificant state.


4
00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:45.074
The emperor steps down.

5
00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:47.617
The country is proclaimed a republic.

6
00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:53.658
Soldiers returning home to a world

7
00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:56.450
where nothing is as it was before.

8
00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:02.074
Some return years
after the end of the war.


9
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:45.825
HOMEFRONT

10
00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:03.867
Everything in vain.

11
00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:08.909
Everything in vain.

12
00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:14.825
You've made a sacrifice
for our fatherland.


13
00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:17.825
And for our emperor.

14
00:02:19.825 --> 00:02:23.575
- It will never be forgotten.
- The letter...


15
00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:27.700
The letter...

16
00:02:28.742 --> 00:02:30.575
Give it to my mother.

17
00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:34.658
You promised.

18
00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:39.366
You'll give it to her yourself.
We'll be home soon.


19
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.492
<i>When after the bloody battle</i>

20
00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:48.074
<i>We return home, weary and worn</i>

21
00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:53.033
<i>Then we shall see everywhere</i>

22
00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:58.408
<i>Victory banners hoisted for us
And they herald...</i>


23
00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:10.825
Farewell.

24
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.241
He didn't make it.

25
00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:29.575
Undress him and throw him in the river.

26
00:03:35.325 --> 00:03:38.158
I promised him I'd take him home.

27
00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:40.617
Do you all want to
join him in the river?

28
00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:45.200
That wasn't the deal!

29
00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.492
It wasn't the deal.

30
00:04:07.617 --> 00:04:09.200
Too many questions at the harbor.

31
00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:11.325
No deaths, no problems.

32
00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:17.949
It means a lot to a mother
to know where her son is buried.


33
00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.949
Who knows if the mother's alive
after all these years.


34
00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.450
There. Vienna!

35
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.575
Vienna! The Freudenau harbor.

36
00:04:34.325 --> 00:04:35.909
"Cemetery of the Nameless"?

37
00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:40.033
For bodies that are washed up,
suicides, murdered,


38
00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:41.784
those who nobody misses.

39
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.492
Heresmaty, come.

40
00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:11.742
Move it. Out of my way.
Out of my way!


41
00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:15.033
- First Lieutenant Perg, Imperial...
- No more "Imperial" now.


42
00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:16.408
Move it!

43
00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:19.867
The coal should already be
in the storehouse. Clear those ropes!


44
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.241
- What's that?
- Red, white, red. Republic of Austria.


45
00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:25.991
No emperor anymore.

46
00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:28.283
Put those ropes with the other ropes!

47
00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:30.033
And take the coal to the coal storage.

48
00:06:30.116 --> 00:06:33.533
Where's Hrdlicka? 
He's snuck off again!

49
00:06:33.617 --> 00:06:36.492
Move those coals faster!

50
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:49.867
Break step.

51
00:07:26.283 --> 00:07:27.575
I myself...

52
00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:31.909
was at the southern front. Isonzo.

53
00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:35.325
Five battles.

54
00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.909
St. Germain.

55
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.116
You can't talk about the war...
People want to forget.


56
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:49.659
Colonel, if I may...

57
00:07:49.742 --> 00:07:51.950
My men and I were prisoners of war

58
00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:55.033
for over two years for our fatherland...

59
00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:56.867
Everything has changed.

60
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.242
Nothing is the way it used to be.

61
00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:02.325
Dark times...

62
00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:06.574
Here.

63
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.283
The Red House.

64
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:14.157
It's a homeless shelter.

65
00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:20.534
In case you need a place to sleep,
or something to eat.


66
00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:24.534
You are discharged from military service.

67
00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:33.242
Lieutenant, sir...

68
00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:35.283
what will become of us?

69
00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:38.950
We only have each other now.

70
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.033
In case you need anything.

71
00:09:01.242 --> 00:09:02.700
Men.

72
00:09:07.242 --> 00:09:09.117
I guess this is it.

73
00:09:12.534 --> 00:09:14.826
Heresmaty.

74
00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:20.367
Bauer, let's see
if they can cook a decent goulash.


75
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.742
Kovacs.

76
00:09:22.991 --> 00:09:24.742
Bauer, so long.

77
00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:28.867
Colonel.

78
00:09:44.742 --> 00:09:46.200
Good luck.

79
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.242
To you, too, Lieutenant, sir.

80
00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:09.784
Opium. Miracle drug from China.

81
00:10:09.867 --> 00:10:13.617
- Forget your sorrows.
- Silver? From an Aryan estate.


82
00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:14.950
I guarantee it.

83
00:10:16.117 --> 00:10:19.283
- Or are you an Israelite yourself?
- Got a groschen?


84
00:10:19.367 --> 00:10:21.909
A groschen! Officer, just a groschen.

85
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:23.617
Isonzo. Isonzo.

86
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:28.617
- Lay down your arms, comrade!
- Peace!


87
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:31.950
Very young girls. 
Anything goes.

88
00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:34.242
Or do you prefer lads?

89
00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:36.617
I have a cheeky boy for you.

90
00:11:26.617 --> 00:11:29.158
Who is there? Who are you?

91
00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:31.200
I'll call the police.

92
00:11:33.158 --> 00:11:36.909
- Come here, good boy.
- Jesus!


93
00:11:36.992 --> 00:11:39.367
- Sir...
- You've grown old.


94
00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:46.492
Mrs. Anna,
I mean, madam is no longer here.


95
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.826
For God's sake! Beggars.

96
00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:04.950
They've turned us into beggars!

97
00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:08.950
I'd rather sleep on the street
than in that... that...


98
00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:13.534
that poorhouse, damn it!

99
00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.826
Hello?

100
00:12:27.909 --> 00:12:29.701
Is anybody there?

101
00:12:32.075 --> 00:12:34.950
- Come. Come on.
- Hold on.


102
00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:36.367
Not so fast.

103
00:12:49.992 --> 00:12:53.826
I just stayed here
to take care of everything.


104
00:12:53.909 --> 00:12:55.742
Good Lord, sir.

105
00:12:55.826 --> 00:13:00.325
Take off your coat.
You'll bring fleas into the house.


106
00:13:01.742 --> 00:13:03.992
It was terrible here.

107
00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.701
Really terrible.

108
00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.075
Nobody had any money left.

109
00:13:08.158 --> 00:13:13.950
And then, your father-in-law
lost his entire fortune.


110
00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:17.242
Damn war bonds.

111
00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:21.033
So she had to go
and work at the factory.

112
00:13:21.117 --> 00:13:24.033
She is so brave, Mrs. Anna.

113
00:13:26.075 --> 00:13:31.284
- Where is she now?
- No one thought you'd come back.


114
00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:34.117
So she moved to her sister's.

115
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.701
To Gumpoldskirchen, in the country.
At least they have something to eat there.


116
00:13:42.075 --> 00:13:45.325
Is Anna... I mean...

117
00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:52.492
- Is there... Did she...
- A decent woman.


118
00:13:52.576 --> 00:13:56.534
She worked hard
to make ends meet with the child.


119
00:13:56.617 --> 00:14:00.200
Everyone has turned mad,
ever since the emperor's gone.


120
00:14:00.284 --> 00:14:03.826
Everyone does what they want. Awful.

121
00:14:09.909 --> 00:14:12.117
I'll go now.

122
00:14:13.242 --> 00:14:15.950
I have to tell madam who's back.

123
00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:19.242
- She will be thrilled.
- No, I...


124
00:14:21.325 --> 00:14:23.576
I want to surprise her.

125
00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:13.576
Superintendent, sir?

126
00:15:16.868 --> 00:15:18.492
Good morning.

127
00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:23.743
Good morning, Doctor.

128
00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:26.659
It doesn't look
like a good morning, does it?


129
00:15:26.743 --> 00:15:31.367
Male, over 20, bad physical condition.
Imperial Infantry uniform, Officer.


130
00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:35.492
Old bullet wound,
several poorly healed cuts and bruises.


131
00:15:35.576 --> 00:15:37.492
Returning soldier.

132
00:15:37.576 --> 00:15:39.534
These days, half the victims

133
00:15:39.617 --> 00:15:42.868
and two-thirds
of the murderers are returning soldiers.


134
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.451
- So you found the body?
- Yes.


135
00:15:45.534 --> 00:15:47.617
Did you see anything?

136
00:15:47.701 --> 00:15:51.242
- I was with a punter...
- A punter? His name, address.


137
00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:56.159
What? They just fuck me.
I don't know who they are.


138
00:15:56.242 --> 00:16:00.743
So it's some drunken brawl.
Severin, arrest some spivs and gypsies.


139
00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:04.617
- Question them and we'll see.
- But just because it's a poor district...


140
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:06.701
For God's sake.

141
00:16:06.784 --> 00:16:10.576
Then secure evidence, question witnesses.
The standard procedure.


142
00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:13.409
He was tortured
before losing consciousness.


143
00:16:13.492 --> 00:16:16.326
The aim was primarily to inflict pain.

144
00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:21.284
He... He's alive.

145
00:16:22.326 --> 00:16:24.367
Post-mortem flatulence.

146
00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:29.034
Farting is one of the few things
we can successfully perform after death.


147
00:16:29.117 --> 00:16:30.950
How fascinating.

148
00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:52.159
Join the Zionist Society. Palestine.

149
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:56.992
These Jewish refugees from the East.
What a filthy pack they are.


150
00:16:57.074 --> 00:17:01.576
They just want to live off us here.
Did we fight for that? I don't think so.


151
00:17:03.075 --> 00:17:06.659
Come to our meeting at the synagogue.

152
00:17:06.743 --> 00:17:09.534
A ticket to Gumpoldskirchen, please.

153
00:17:09.618 --> 00:17:11.326
Seventy groschen, please.

154
00:17:32.826 --> 00:17:34.909
Stop him!

155
00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:37.367
- Stop!
- Hey, hey! Easy!


156
00:17:37.451 --> 00:17:39.451
- Not so fast.
- My wallet!


157
00:17:39.534 --> 00:17:41.492
- That man has...
- Your identity card!


158
00:17:41.576 --> 00:17:44.743
- Are you a late returnee?
- My discharge papers are in that wallet.


159
00:17:46.117 --> 00:17:48.117
- Listen, mate...
- He stole it.


160
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.701
Now empty your pockets slowly.

161
00:17:52.326 --> 00:17:54.284
- Superintendent, sir.
- Yes?


162
00:17:54.367 --> 00:17:57.284
I found this note
in the victim's belongings.


163
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.326
And?

164
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.618
He's back.

165
00:18:28.659 --> 00:18:31.159
- Peter Perg?
- What's that racket?


166
00:18:31.242 --> 00:18:36.367
What will the neighbors think?
And you're going to wreck that door!


167
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:40.534
You can't just walk in here.
I can announce you. Maybe then...


168
00:18:40.618 --> 00:18:42.075
- What's going on?
- Peter Perg?


169
00:18:42.159 --> 00:18:43.743
- I told him...
- Come with me.


170
00:18:43.826 --> 00:18:45.618
- Why?
- But these policemen...


171
00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:49.326
We ask the questions.

172
00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:52.075
Have you been causing trouble, sir?

173
00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:06.659
- Where were you last night?
- Are the handcuffs really necessary?


174
00:19:06.743 --> 00:19:08.826
- Where were you?
- At home.


175
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.075
Witnesses?

176
00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:12.910
Did anybody see you?

177
00:19:14.075 --> 00:19:16.159
I know what witnesses are.

178
00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:21.284
We can lock you up, you know?

179
00:19:23.992 --> 00:19:27.201
Peter, it's really you. 
Good to see you.

180
00:19:27.284 --> 00:19:29.618
You had me dragged in
like a criminal for that?


181
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:31.618
A witness.
I thought you knew what that is.


182
00:19:31.701 --> 00:19:33.826
- Clever young boy.
- How dare you?


183
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.950
Let's talk in my office.

184
00:19:36.034 --> 00:19:38.576
And take off his bloody handcuffs, okay?

185
00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:42.826
Yes, Superintendent, sir.

186
00:19:45.326 --> 00:19:46.367
Sorry.

187
00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:50.534
Police Superintendent? Respect.

188
00:19:52.576 --> 00:19:54.992
You made it far, Victor.

189
00:19:58.826 --> 00:20:02.409
It's great that you're back again.
You look great.


190
00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:04.451
I survived.

191
00:20:05.493 --> 00:20:07.743
You didn't expect that, did you?

192
00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:15.992
Jubilantly running after the imperial flag
on the very first day of war!


193
00:20:17.326 --> 00:20:19.743
Out of a sense of duty, I suppose.

194
00:20:19.826 --> 00:20:23.367
You could've done your duty here,
as a policeman. Like I did.


195
00:20:23.451 --> 00:20:28.910
Grow up, Peter.
You made the wrong decision back then.


196
00:20:28.992 --> 00:20:32.159
It was also wrong because of Anna.

197
00:20:32.242 --> 00:20:34.117
Leave Anna out of this.

198
00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.326
We found a body.

199
00:20:47.743 --> 00:20:49.409
A daily occurrence
where I just came from.


200
00:20:49.493 --> 00:20:50.992
The war is over.

201
00:20:51.076 --> 00:20:53.242
Maybe he deserved to die.

202
00:21:02.826 --> 00:21:04.659
This here...

203
00:21:04.743 --> 00:21:07.326
was found on the victim, dear Peter.

204
00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:09.910
Most interesting, don't you think?

205
00:21:09.992 --> 00:21:11.659
Look.

206
00:21:18.618 --> 00:21:21.117
Probably one of his comrades-in-arms.

207
00:21:21.201 --> 00:21:23.576
A certain First Lieutenant Krainer.

208
00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:28.201
They arrived here a few days ago,
from the Black Sea via the Danube.


209
00:21:28.284 --> 00:21:30.868
They were in a Russian camp together.

210
00:21:32.242 --> 00:21:36.117
- Maybe they had a fight.
- And he nailed him to a pole?


211
00:21:36.201 --> 00:21:39.409
Is that what you do
when you fall out with a friend?


212
00:21:39.493 --> 00:21:41.034
Didn't think so.

213
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.368
Gentlemen.

214
00:21:46.284 --> 00:21:49.409
This is Dr. Körner,
our forensic pathologist.


215
00:21:49.493 --> 00:21:52.785
All her male colleagues
went to war, so...


216
00:21:52.868 --> 00:21:54.785
They forced this battle-axe on you.

217
00:21:54.868 --> 00:21:57.201
- I'd never say such a thing.
- You'd just think it.


218
00:21:59.868 --> 00:22:01.785
Welcome back, Inspector Perg.

219
00:22:01.868 --> 00:22:04.868
You know each other? Interesting.

220
00:22:34.493 --> 00:22:38.201
Yes, there are strangulation marks
on his neck, but that didn't kill him.


221
00:22:41.451 --> 00:22:44.910
- Wire snare?
- Is it him or not?


222
00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.368
First Lieutenant Hermann Krainer.

223
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:57.409
Served six years out
of a sense of duty.

224
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:00.368
One day back home.

225
00:23:28.243 --> 00:23:31.534
Those who weren't killed or crippled
in this horrible war,


226
00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:33.326
came back totally deranged.

227
00:23:36.326 --> 00:23:39.868
- I'm sorry, Inspector...
- I know you didn't mean it like that.


228
00:23:39.951 --> 00:23:41.660
And even if you did...

229
00:23:44.117 --> 00:23:45.576
you would've been right.

230
00:23:48.701 --> 00:23:50.951
- Victor.
- Peter.


231
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.201
Superintendent, sir. Madam.

232
00:23:58.868 --> 00:24:01.951
Dr. Körner, be honest,

233
00:24:02.034 --> 00:24:04.992
do you think Perg might
have something to do with this case?


234
00:24:06.576 --> 00:24:09.409
Of course
he has nothing to do with this case.


235
00:24:09.493 --> 00:24:13.284
On the contrary.
If anyone can solve this case, it's him.


236
00:24:15.326 --> 00:24:17.535
He used to be your colleague, right?

237
00:24:24.034 --> 00:24:27.368
Au revoir. Merci beaucoup, Colonel.

238
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.284
Fucking sponger.

239
00:25:12.701 --> 00:25:17.159
Mr. Perg. I wanted to ask you
to leave your keys with me


240
00:25:17.243 --> 00:25:19.701
when you go to visit your wife.

241
00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:22.034
So, when do you intend to go?

242
00:25:25.368 --> 00:25:28.326
Who supported Anna when I was away?

243
00:25:29.409 --> 00:25:32.618
Renner, the generous benefactor?

244
00:25:32.701 --> 00:25:36.868
You should be glad
that you have friends like him.


245
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:40.868
He's a friendly and generous man,
the police superintendent.


246
00:25:41.951 --> 00:25:45.159
Or should we die of hunger
because of the stupid war?


247
00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:48.326
What do you know about war?

248
00:25:50.535 --> 00:25:51.743
You're right.

249
00:25:53.034 --> 00:25:55.368
I don't understand the war.

250
00:25:55.451 --> 00:25:59.910
But a father should be with his child.
We needed you here.


251
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.493
You want to be brave?
Then stop running away.


252
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.827
You want to admit Perg
to the police corps?


253
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.368
The victim had a note
with his name on it!


254
00:26:44.451 --> 00:26:46.743
That's more proof it wasn't him.

255
00:26:47.743 --> 00:26:50.868
His name is top
of our list of suspects!

256
00:26:50.951 --> 00:26:55.992
A list? So we have other suspects
thanks to your investigation?


257
00:26:56.076 --> 00:27:00.451
Perg was hunting down criminals
before you could even pee straight.


258
00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:02.201
In the good old days,

259
00:27:02.284 --> 00:27:06.159
when the police served a bourgeois system
and arrested any poor soul?


260
00:27:06.243 --> 00:27:09.743
My brother didn't make it back from war,
while rich bastards like Perg...


261
00:27:09.827 --> 00:27:12.159
The war is over, for God's sake.

262
00:27:12.243 --> 00:27:16.034
And now go and fetch
our colleague Mr. Perg.


263
00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:19.118
We've got a new body.
Wien Valley bridge.


264
00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:21.618
Off you go to Mr. Perg. Move it.

265
00:27:33.284 --> 00:27:36.326
I don't give a shit
if you were a police inspector once.


266
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.410
As long as you have no alibi,
you're the main suspect.


267
00:27:49.493 --> 00:27:52.076
Your factories will stand still

268
00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:55.201
If it is the red fist's will

269
00:27:55.284 --> 00:28:00.660
Your factories will stand still
If it is the red fist's will


270
00:28:02.951 --> 00:28:04.993
We'll walk from here.

271
00:28:18.951 --> 00:28:20.368
- ID.
- I'm with him.


272
00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:24.368
Severin.

273
00:28:39.993 --> 00:28:42.410
- Has anything been moved?
- No.


274
00:28:42.493 --> 00:28:44.410
That guy found the body

275
00:28:44.493 --> 00:28:47.451
and we immediately
cordoned off the area by the book.


276
00:28:47.535 --> 00:28:49.827
Hey, children! Get lost! Move it!

277
00:28:50.827 --> 00:28:52.743
Filthy rabble.

278
00:28:56.243 --> 00:28:59.243
Would you mind helping me
to measure the body?


279
00:28:59.326 --> 00:29:01.410
Why don't you ask our new colleague?

280
00:29:01.493 --> 00:29:03.993
I'm stuck with him thanks to you, no?

281
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.410
I don't trust him.

282
00:29:13.868 --> 00:29:15.660
A friend of the boss.

283
00:29:19.326 --> 00:29:21.326
I don't care whose friend he is.

284
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.285
What?

285
00:29:32.702 --> 00:29:34.159
The cat-o'-nine-tails.

286
00:29:35.993 --> 00:29:37.702
The whip?

287
00:29:40.034 --> 00:29:41.159
Yes.

288
00:29:42.285 --> 00:29:46.951
Looks like tiny claws ripped
the victim's flesh from his body.


289
00:29:47.034 --> 00:29:49.243
- And the crust round the wound?
- Analysis will...


290
00:29:49.326 --> 00:29:51.577
- Salt.
- Salt?


291
00:29:53.076 --> 00:29:55.326
To make sure he stayed awake.

292
00:30:00.743 --> 00:30:02.910
You were right.

293
00:30:04.326 --> 00:30:06.159
I am deranged.

294
00:30:07.577 --> 00:30:12.243
At the crime scene just now...
Death, crime, suffering...


295
00:30:14.243 --> 00:30:19.326
It felt like home for the first time,
unlike here, in this strange world.


296
00:30:23.326 --> 00:30:25.618
Would you join me for a coffee?

297
00:30:26.869 --> 00:30:29.076
I...

298
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.577
I don't know
if I fit into this environment.


299
00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:35.993
It's on me.

300
00:30:37.118 --> 00:30:39.451
Assuming you can accept
a lady's invitation.


301
00:30:58.827 --> 00:31:00.243
I'm a war profiteer.

302
00:31:01.618 --> 00:31:06.201
Under normal circumstances, they'd have
let me rot away in the forensic archives.


303
00:31:06.285 --> 00:31:08.201
It's a new era.

304
00:31:08.285 --> 00:31:10.827
If you try, you'll see its good sides:

305
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:14.201
freedom, justice and change.

306
00:31:15.285 --> 00:31:18.326
- I like change.
- The only solution is anarchism!


307
00:31:21.201 --> 00:31:24.410
- Anarchists.
- Not really.


308
00:31:24.493 --> 00:31:27.118
Communists, at best.
Futurists, Dadaists...


309
00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:29.076
Everyone's some sort of -ist these days.

310
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.577
And you?

311
00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.702
- Realist.
- Despite the reality here?


312
00:31:34.744 --> 00:31:37.618
Because of it. And pacifist.

313
00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:41.285
The glorification of war and fatherland...

314
00:31:41.368 --> 00:31:43.493
- You can't understand.
- No.


315
00:31:45.201 --> 00:31:47.827
Putting comrades before one's own family.

316
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.076
What did your wife say
when you came back?


317
00:31:54.535 --> 00:31:56.702
I'm not sure if she wants me back.

318
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.368
How can I burden my daughter
with someone like me?


319
00:32:06.744 --> 00:32:08.535
What are you afraid of?

320
00:32:12.243 --> 00:32:15.243
I'm sorry. I've no right
to speak to you like that.


321
00:32:15.326 --> 00:32:17.618
- I'm sure your wife still loves you.
- Thank you.


322
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.118
How stupid...

323
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.285
DEAR ANNA...

324
00:33:50.827 --> 00:33:54.243
- Have you ever seen a dead person?
- My father.


325
00:33:54.327 --> 00:33:57.327
Now he has a new father
who beats the shit out of him.


326
00:34:01.702 --> 00:34:06.492
You know, I don't believe that the old man
was the first to find the body.


327
00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:08.577
Before you lads did.

328
00:34:09.619 --> 00:34:14.285
A man with just one leg,
walking on crutches, whereas you...


329
00:34:15.744 --> 00:34:17.327
are such sporty lads.

330
00:34:18.826 --> 00:34:22.201
Maybe you found... other stuff?

331
00:34:26.327 --> 00:34:29.827
Listen, I know full well
it's possible that missing soldiers...


332
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:35.368
Yes, my brother. Lieutenant Josef Severin,
Imperial and Royal Dragoons.


333
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:41.368
What's "unanswered" supposed to mean?

334
00:34:48.535 --> 00:34:49.702
What?

335
00:34:52.744 --> 00:34:54.993
I've got it.

336
00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:58.243
The cat-o'-nine-tails.

337
00:35:11.035 --> 00:35:15.535
I find it odd that the victim's fingers
and toes have been cut off.


338
00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:19.827
There's a new method to identify people
using their fingerprints.


339
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:24.076
You shouldn't believe
any new-fangled nonsense, Severin.


340
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.160
- Sorry.
- Maybe it's some kind of ritual.


341
00:35:28.452 --> 00:35:30.619
But why leave one finger?

342
00:35:42.744 --> 00:35:47.577
We've discussed
your return to the homicide squad.


343
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:51.993
It's looking good,
but there will be a probation period.


344
00:35:54.243 --> 00:35:57.827
- Probation?
- Do you know how hard I fought for you?


345
00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.910
- How are Anna and Magdalena?
- Marlene.


346
00:36:00.993 --> 00:36:05.160
- I'm sure Marlene is doing fine.
- Peter, you haven't been...


347
00:36:05.243 --> 00:36:07.118
Perg.

348
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:13.660
- Count Starkenberg.
- It's Mr. Starkenberg these days.


349
00:36:13.744 --> 00:36:17.410
Or should I have you arrested
for monarchist activities?


350
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.951
Former Inspector Perg

351
00:36:22.035 --> 00:36:24.869
returned after being a prisoner of war,
and is now helping us...


352
00:36:24.951 --> 00:36:29.619
What do they call Russia now?
The Soviet Union, right, Perg?


353
00:36:30.702 --> 00:36:33.035
You're on the red side now, too?

354
00:36:33.118 --> 00:36:36.702
- Chief Commissioner, I don't understand...
- Just a question, comrade Perg.


355
00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:39.993
I was just wondering.
Dictatorship of the proletariat.


356
00:36:40.076 --> 00:36:43.951
It's an appealing idea, no?
So are you a communist now?


357
00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:48.786
- I faithfully served my fatherland...
- See how skillfully he avoids answering?


358
00:36:48.869 --> 00:36:51.494
That's what they teach them.

359
00:36:52.494 --> 00:36:57.118
We don't need a nest of red vipers
here at police HQ.


360
00:36:57.202 --> 00:37:00.951
- Do we, Renner?
- Of course not, Count... Mr. Starkenberg.


361
00:37:01.035 --> 00:37:04.951
Could you at least solve the case
with our Bolshevik's support?


362
00:37:05.035 --> 00:37:06.786
- We are...
- Very good.


363
00:37:06.869 --> 00:37:09.827
The interior minister will hold
a press conference next week.


364
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.744
Either he talks about the solved case,

365
00:37:12.827 --> 00:37:16.744
or about a Bolshevik cell at HQ
that has been smoked out.


366
00:37:18.577 --> 00:37:20.327
Renner.

367
00:37:23.368 --> 00:37:25.744
We're feeling confident.

368
00:37:44.993 --> 00:37:47.951
FOR THE POOR OF VIENNA

369
00:38:04.327 --> 00:38:08.577
They can't cook either,
those Salvation Army women.


370
00:38:09.577 --> 00:38:13.702
We're treated like dirt,
like we're the scum of the earth.


371
00:38:13.786 --> 00:38:17.452
"Your sacrifice for your emperor
shall never be forgotten."


372
00:38:20.494 --> 00:38:23.327
An Austrian comrade gave me this.

373
00:38:24.577 --> 00:38:26.452
A private.

374
00:38:28.494 --> 00:38:30.577
National Socialists.

375
00:38:31.577 --> 00:38:36.369
The only ones who understand us,
who take care of us.


376
00:38:36.452 --> 00:38:38.910
First Lieutenant Krainer has been killed.

377
00:38:42.535 --> 00:38:45.410
Krainer didn't want to live anymore.

378
00:38:45.494 --> 00:38:47.243
He didn't.

379
00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:53.035
He's right. Bauer isn't that crazy.

380
00:38:54.285 --> 00:38:56.452
Krainer didn't want to live anymore.

381
00:38:57.577 --> 00:38:59.410
Kovacs,

382
00:38:59.494 --> 00:39:03.951
was Krainer here,
with you, in the Red House?


383
00:39:05.243 --> 00:39:08.202
No, he left.

384
00:39:08.285 --> 00:39:11.827
He left? Did anything unusual happen?

385
00:39:13.535 --> 00:39:15.452
There was this man.

386
00:39:18.327 --> 00:39:19.494
What man?

387
00:39:21.202 --> 00:39:24.952
- Bauer, what man?
- You don't look anyone in the eye here.


388
00:39:27.118 --> 00:39:29.118
Everyone's ashamed.

389
00:40:42.619 --> 00:40:45.285
Mommy. Mommy, look.

390
00:40:46.536 --> 00:40:50.661
Are you seeing things again?
Oh, my Marlene.


391
00:40:56.494 --> 00:40:59.077
And, did you visit your wife?

392
00:41:02.869 --> 00:41:06.952
The silver candleholders,
the Klimt drawings...


393
00:41:07.035 --> 00:41:10.410
Our belongings you were "looking after."

394
00:41:10.494 --> 00:41:13.410
- Bring them back again.
- Politeness doesn't hurt.


395
00:41:15.077 --> 00:41:19.744
Superintendent Renner
always gave me a tip.


396
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.619
And when he left early in the morning,
he gave me double the amount.


397
00:41:53.536 --> 00:41:56.327
Hey! Sir! Hello!

398
00:42:07.702 --> 00:42:10.536
Victor! Where are you?

399
00:42:11.577 --> 00:42:14.369
Peter, what are you doing here?
What's wrong?


400
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.869
It's all right. 
He's a friend.

401
00:42:49.035 --> 00:42:51.035
I've always loved her.

402
00:42:52.411 --> 00:42:54.411
From the very first moment.

403
00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:04.244
It happened during the darkest hours,

404
00:43:04.327 --> 00:43:06.160
back then in 1918.

405
00:43:07.702 --> 00:43:11.411
We hadn't heard from you
for three years.


406
00:43:12.619 --> 00:43:14.494
Not a word.

407
00:43:15.952 --> 00:43:18.160
It went on for four weeks.

408
00:43:20.244 --> 00:43:25.035
At some point I realized
that she was only going to bed with me


409
00:43:27.494 --> 00:43:30.661
because she knew
that she'd never fall in love with me.


410
00:43:31.828 --> 00:43:37.119
That I'd never pose a threat
to her love for you.


411
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.327
In her eyes, I was just "kind."

412
00:43:50.285 --> 00:43:53.452
I actually tried
to poison myself with Veronal.


413
00:43:53.536 --> 00:43:55.077
But...

414
00:43:56.077 --> 00:44:01.244
I'm even too dull to kill myself.

415
00:44:11.536 --> 00:44:13.369
Peter...

416
00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:16.869
Peter?

417
00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.703
Okay.

418
00:44:38.077 --> 00:44:40.536
This might hurt a little.

419
00:44:42.952 --> 00:44:44.703
But your scars are healing very well.

420
00:44:45.952 --> 00:44:47.202
Don't move now.

421
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.744
Good.

422
00:45:01.744 --> 00:45:04.910
And? It shouldn't be too tight.

423
00:45:09.077 --> 00:45:11.286
Nineteen beautiful white teeth.

424
00:45:13.703 --> 00:45:15.577
Nineteen teeth...

425
00:45:16.744 --> 00:45:18.369
I'll be right back.

426
00:45:51.703 --> 00:45:53.869
Would you buy me a drink?

427
00:46:01.994 --> 00:46:04.828
Normal costs ten. Kinky, 15.

428
00:46:48.411 --> 00:46:49.910
What do you all want from me?

429
00:46:50.994 --> 00:46:53.327
What do you all want from me?

430
00:46:53.411 --> 00:46:55.452
You know there was no other way!

431
00:47:00.286 --> 00:47:03.327
Let's go! Get lost, bastard!

432
00:47:08.494 --> 00:47:12.578
I'm sorry, Doctor, but Mr. Perg
won't be back until tomorrow morning.


433
00:47:12.661 --> 00:47:14.411
Very well.

434
00:47:14.494 --> 00:47:16.703
- Thanks. Good evening.
- Doctor.


435
00:47:26.327 --> 00:47:27.910
Excuse me.

436
00:47:28.994 --> 00:47:30.619
Pardon.

437
00:47:31.744 --> 00:47:35.161
You were just at the police station
looking for Perg.


438
00:47:35.244 --> 00:47:38.244
You withhold information from me
and give it to Perg?


439
00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:44.077
You really don't know
who Perg is, do you?

440
00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:48.035
- Ever heard of the Molden case?
- Lieutenant Molden? Yes.


441
00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:50.369
The green widow? 
The Stankowski case?

442
00:47:50.453 --> 00:47:51.703
And Perg...

443
00:47:53.494 --> 00:47:54.870
The butcher of Hernals?

444
00:47:54.952 --> 00:47:58.453
He raped and mutilated women
if they could do more than cook and pray,


445
00:47:58.536 --> 00:48:01.077
or if, God forbid,
they were better than men.


446
00:48:01.161 --> 00:48:04.536
Even if the girl was just a stenographer
in the forensics unit.


447
00:48:09.035 --> 00:48:10.536
I'm sorry.

448
00:48:14.703 --> 00:48:17.453
If it wasn't for Perg,
I wouldn't be standing here.


449
00:48:21.745 --> 00:48:26.661
A man like him has to endure humiliation
just to return to the police service.


450
00:48:26.745 --> 00:48:28.661
Nineteen wooden stakes.

451
00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:33.077
You wanted to know
what I was going to tell Perg.


452
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:37.369
The first victim was pierced
by 19 wooden stakes.


453
00:48:38.619 --> 00:48:42.910
Nineteen stakes, 19 fingers and toes.
Maybe it's a coincidence.


454
00:48:43.952 --> 00:48:45.578
You're the detective.

455
00:48:56.244 --> 00:48:59.202
- What's going on?
- Who have we got here?


456
00:48:59.286 --> 00:49:00.952
Stop.

457
00:49:02.327 --> 00:49:04.910
Arrest me, please.

458
00:49:04.994 --> 00:49:07.536
- I'm a filthy coward.
- Sure.


459
00:49:07.619 --> 00:49:12.036
Go home and sleep the booze off
and we'll arrest you tomorrow.


460
00:49:13.077 --> 00:49:16.578
- My wife, she left me.
- I can see why.


461
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:20.244
She hates me.
I lost the whole war.


462
00:49:20.327 --> 00:49:23.286
You'd rather be arrested
than go to your wife?


463
00:49:25.578 --> 00:49:26.745
Lost everything.

464
00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:26.369
Just you and me.

465
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:29.745
Look at me.

466
00:50:32.411 --> 00:50:35.119
Look at me, damn it!

467
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.620
You!

468
00:50:41.703 --> 00:50:43.494
You won't win.

469
00:50:43.578 --> 00:50:45.286
You won't break me.

470
00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:51.369
For God, Emperor and Fatherland.

471
00:50:53.453 --> 00:50:55.369
You all fucked me over.

472
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.077
I've got something for you.

473
00:51:28.077 --> 00:51:30.077
No! No!

474
00:51:30.161 --> 00:51:31.411
Hello!

475
00:51:32.411 --> 00:51:34.036
Police!

476
00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:36.161
Help! Please, help!

477
00:52:22.244 --> 00:52:25.077
No quick death.

478
00:52:25.161 --> 00:52:27.244
Wait for the suffering.

479
00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:30.495
Hey, you!

480
00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:38.994
Hey, what are you doing?

481
00:52:39.077 --> 00:52:42.244
- Got you, mate.
- You're going to prison, you prick.


482
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:46.077
Don't move.

483
00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:48.328
We'll catch your buddy later.

484
00:52:55.411 --> 00:52:57.119
- Your friend...
- He's not my friend.


485
00:52:57.203 --> 00:53:00.620
Mr. Perg pissed on an altar.
I mean urinated.


486
00:53:00.703 --> 00:53:02.578
Mr. Perg is an important witness.

487
00:53:02.661 --> 00:53:05.036
Comrades, come rally...

488
00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:08.328
Shut up or I'll lock you up
with the German nationalists!


489
00:53:09.578 --> 00:53:14.036
Whatever. This is a case
of blasphemous pissing, urinating.


490
00:53:15.536 --> 00:53:17.620
Listen, dear colleague, he is...

491
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:21.203
He's the best criminologist we've got.

492
00:53:24.578 --> 00:53:27.745
I need your signature, three copies.

493
00:53:29.328 --> 00:53:31.077
Wait here.

494
00:53:37.244 --> 00:53:39.244
You were lucky.

495
00:53:39.328 --> 00:53:42.036
If you hadn't peed on the altar,
the woman wouldn't have called the police.


496
00:53:43.661 --> 00:53:45.828
She didn't see you fighting for your life.

497
00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:50.328
Körner told me all about you.

498
00:53:50.411 --> 00:53:54.203
- Your successes, your mother...
- She shouldn't have.


499
00:53:55.203 --> 00:53:57.411
I don't think it was a coincidence.

500
00:53:57.495 --> 00:54:00.369
You're closing in on him
with your investigation.


501
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:05.078
Crime is a disease that will be healed
when social issues are resolved.


502
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:08.453
You don't believe people can be evil?

503
00:54:08.536 --> 00:54:11.244
I believe in the possibility
of a just world.


504
00:54:11.328 --> 00:54:15.453
International solidarity,
a world without wars, hunger and crime.


505
00:54:15.536 --> 00:54:18.703
- My brother was a socialist. He always...
- Severin.


506
00:54:22.244 --> 00:54:24.994
I happened to overhear your phone call.

507
00:54:26.286 --> 00:54:28.203
About your brother.

508
00:54:28.286 --> 00:54:31.078
And that you still have hope.

509
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:35.911
Missing for two years.
So there's no chance...


510
00:54:35.994 --> 00:54:37.828
Hoping in spite of everything is torture.

511
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:40.119
I knew him.

512
00:54:41.286 --> 00:54:44.828
Lieutenant Josef Severin,
Fourth Dragoons.


513
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:46.536
We were in the camp together.

514
00:54:47.745 --> 00:54:49.661
He's dead.

515
00:54:53.828 --> 00:54:55.370
You...

516
00:55:00.661 --> 00:55:02.536
I just stumbled.

517
00:55:14.495 --> 00:55:16.244
I was ten.

518
00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:20.578
There was a ship graveyard in the bay.

519
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:24.620
While playing hide-and-seek,

520
00:55:24.703 --> 00:55:26.952
I fell through the deck
of a rusty tugboat.


521
00:55:27.036 --> 00:55:29.662
The other kids frantically looked for me.

522
00:55:29.745 --> 00:55:33.453
A storm rolled in that night.
It lasted two days.


523
00:55:33.536 --> 00:55:36.994
And I was stuck in the smelly,
brackish water, with a smashed leg.


524
00:55:41.536 --> 00:55:44.536
I was too exhausted to cry for help.

525
00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.620
And too exhausted to fight
the rising water of the Danube.


526
00:55:48.703 --> 00:55:51.787
The search party had given up.

527
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.495
Everyone was sure I'd drowned
or been swept away by the current.


528
00:56:00.328 --> 00:56:02.536
Only my brother kept looking for me.

529
00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:06.828
Although it made no sense.

530
00:56:15.286 --> 00:56:17.328
Until he found me.

531
00:56:24.703 --> 00:56:26.911
He never gave up.

532
00:56:29.286 --> 00:56:30.662
He was a brave man.

533
00:56:34.078 --> 00:56:35.994
Up to the very end.

534
00:57:08.495 --> 00:57:10.286
Excuse me.

535
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:12.662
Dr. Körner.

536
00:57:12.745 --> 00:57:15.370
- May I?
- Yes. I...


537
00:57:15.453 --> 00:57:18.119
I heard about your...

538
00:57:19.828 --> 00:57:24.036
- Well...
- ...mishap.


539
00:57:24.119 --> 00:57:25.370
Well...

540
00:57:26.453 --> 00:57:28.245
He struck again.

541
00:57:28.328 --> 00:57:32.620
- I guess you haven't been informed.
- No. What happened?


542
00:57:32.703 --> 00:57:35.703
He stuck the victim's legs
in a cage full of rats.


543
00:57:36.828 --> 00:57:38.411
Two dozen hungry rats.

544
00:57:41.994 --> 00:57:44.161
- Rats?
- Who would be so inhumane?


545
00:57:51.703 --> 00:57:53.745
Inhumane?

546
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:55.495
Just look in the newspaper.

547
00:57:56.495 --> 00:57:58.620
Killing and torturing
is very human indeed.


548
00:57:58.703 --> 00:58:01.953
But he's perversely vain.
He creates tableaus of death.


549
00:58:02.036 --> 00:58:05.829
I understand killing in a moment
of passion or madness, even in a war.


550
00:58:05.911 --> 00:58:09.328
Circumstances might force people
to do gruesome things, but...


551
00:58:11.245 --> 00:58:12.870
Mr. Perg?

552
00:58:24.745 --> 00:58:29.161
- What's that?
- Negro music from America.


553
00:58:31.078 --> 00:58:33.370
They call it jazz.

554
00:58:33.453 --> 00:58:35.328
But they aren't Negroes.

555
00:58:40.411 --> 00:58:43.078
Admit it, you liked it, right?

556
00:58:43.161 --> 00:58:45.953
I saw you tapping your foot.

557
00:58:46.036 --> 00:58:50.578
Before I left this city, there was nothing
but waltzes and operettas.


558
00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.495
And then...

559
00:58:56.328 --> 00:58:58.662
a time machine belched me out here.

560
00:59:02.495 --> 00:59:04.745
Thanks for walking me home.

561
00:59:09.453 --> 00:59:11.370
It was nice.

562
00:59:19.286 --> 00:59:20.911
I liked it, too.

563
01:00:12.161 --> 01:00:13.829
What are you thinking about?

564
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.161
Whether you deserve happiness?

565
01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.704
We have to see the crime scene.

566
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.495
- Hoffmann, you stay here.
- Yes, sir.


567
01:00:55.453 --> 01:00:59.911
The victim was a day laborer
by the name of Eugen Richter.


568
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:09.161
By the way, Körner identified
the body from under the bridge.


569
01:01:09.245 --> 01:01:11.453
A former soldier. 
Lieutenant Bernfeld.

570
01:01:14.328 --> 01:01:16.036
Bernfeld?

571
01:01:19.662 --> 01:01:22.120
Eugen Richter was no day laborer.

572
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:25.995
He was a cavalry captain.

573
01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:29.328
You knew him, too?

574
01:01:29.412 --> 01:01:32.495
- We have to see Renner.
- It's Saturday afternoon. Where...


575
01:01:32.578 --> 01:01:36.453
Renner might change his beliefs,
but he never changes his habits.


576
01:01:38.453 --> 01:01:42.036
Good evening, gentlemen.
Are you members... Excuse me!


577
01:01:45.161 --> 01:01:47.662
Severin, how did he get out of prison?

578
01:01:47.745 --> 01:01:49.245
We have no time for discussions.

579
01:01:49.328 --> 01:01:51.620
Shut up, Victor.

580
01:01:51.704 --> 01:01:53.953
We know the murderer's motive.

581
01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:01.453
In our prisoner-of-war camp,
escape attempts got the maximum penalty.


582
01:02:01.537 --> 01:02:04.620
- Death?
- No. Worse.


583
01:02:04.704 --> 01:02:07.370
Running the gauntlet,
the cat-o'-nine-tails,


584
01:02:07.453 --> 01:02:09.704
the rat hole, ice swimming.

585
01:02:11.953 --> 01:02:15.662
And then at the end,
they faced the rage of their comrades.


586
01:02:15.745 --> 01:02:17.328
Why?

587
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:22.453
If your own people
didn't report an escape plan,


588
01:02:22.537 --> 01:02:25.245
they'd shoot every tenth prisoner.

589
01:02:27.328 --> 01:02:29.579
Decimation.

590
01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:33.370
There were only 50,000 of us left.
Originally, there were 240,000.


591
01:02:34.662 --> 01:02:38.412
Typhus, dysentery, hunger, cold.

592
01:02:40.745 --> 01:02:44.203
- And the shootings.
- The Russians.


593
01:02:44.287 --> 01:02:47.829
They're just as bad
as the English, the French and us.


594
01:02:50.328 --> 01:02:52.620
We had a committee in the camp.

595
01:02:52.704 --> 01:02:56.787
A committee consisting of six officers
representing our people.


596
01:02:56.871 --> 01:03:01.453
At some point, they found out that

597
01:03:01.537 --> 01:03:05.495
The committee told them not to do it.
They asked them. Begged them.


598
01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.662
The officers managed
to convince one of the 20 men


599
01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:12.245
to tell them when the escape was planned.

600
01:03:14.203 --> 01:03:16.662
The officers had no choice

601
01:03:17.745 --> 01:03:21.328
but to report the escape plan,
thus saving the lives of 5,000 men.


602
01:03:22.412 --> 01:03:25.412
And the others? The other 19?

603
01:03:25.495 --> 01:03:29.787
They were tortured so badly that
the guy who'd betrayed them lost his mind.


604
01:03:29.871 --> 01:03:32.328
You've never seen anything like it.

605
01:03:33.745 --> 01:03:36.495
But what has this got
to do with our case?

606
01:03:41.704 --> 01:03:45.203
Krainer, Bernfeld and Richter

607
01:03:47.287 --> 01:03:49.412
were members of that committee.

608
01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:55.162
Why did the murderer
spare Bernfeld's thumb?


609
01:03:57.245 --> 01:04:01.453
He didn't spare it.
He cut off 19 parts of Bernfeld's body.


610
01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:07.120
Krainer was pierced by 19 wooden stakes
and I bet there were 19 rats in the cage.


611
01:04:08.662 --> 01:04:10.871
Nineteen men were betrayed.

612
01:04:11.911 --> 01:04:14.162
And it seems one survived.

613
01:04:15.537 --> 01:04:18.328
We have to find the rest
of the committee members.


614
01:04:21.162 --> 01:04:23.537
Because they are the next victims.

615
01:04:27.078 --> 01:04:29.412
And who were
the other committee members?


616
01:04:30.412 --> 01:04:34.036
August Wehninger of Wehninger Brewery
and Count Heresmaty.


617
01:04:35.036 --> 01:04:36.871
But you said there were six.

618
01:04:40.287 --> 01:04:42.579
The sixth member never made it back.

619
01:04:44.995 --> 01:04:49.120
- We can't waste any time. Let's go.
- Peter, not you.


620
01:04:49.203 --> 01:04:52.871
Starkenberg
has heard about the altar incident.


621
01:04:52.953 --> 01:04:55.370
To him, blasphemy
and Bolshevism are the same.


622
01:04:55.454 --> 01:04:59.203
I won't dig my own grave
because you pissed in a church.


623
01:04:59.287 --> 01:05:01.245
- But you can't...
- You're out.


624
01:05:01.328 --> 01:05:03.412
I'm sorry, but it's not my fault.

625
01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:18.412
Hoffmann, get in the back.

626
01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:22.036
- Hoffmann.
- Yes, sir?


627
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.078
We're just giving Mr. Perg a lift.
Strictly private business.


628
01:05:26.162 --> 01:05:28.162
Of course, Inspector.

629
01:05:35.746 --> 01:05:37.620
Strictly private business.

630
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:52.953
- Hoffmann, you stay here.
- Yes, sir.


631
01:05:53.037 --> 01:05:56.162
The young count...
Didn't you hear about it?


632
01:05:56.245 --> 01:05:58.537
Two days after his return...

633
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:05.953
The mansion is now in the possession
of the Lower Austrian Fire Insurance.


634
01:06:06.037 --> 01:06:10.370
They let him stay
in the concierge's lodge.


635
01:06:10.454 --> 01:06:12.871
But he didn't like it.

636
01:06:12.953 --> 01:06:16.078
Well, a new era's arrived...

637
01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.329
He probably spared himself
a dreadful death.


638
01:06:24.746 --> 01:06:26.495
Or maybe...

639
01:06:30.329 --> 01:06:32.704
he missed out on an interesting life.

640
01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:52.370
Inspectors Perg and Severin.
We're looking for Mr. August Wehninger.


641
01:06:55.245 --> 01:06:56.911
Come in.

642
01:07:06.037 --> 01:07:09.203
- Where is Captain Wehninger?
- He left early in the morning.


643
01:07:09.287 --> 01:07:13.287
Maybe he's at the brewery.
Thanks, Fritz. Let's take a break.


644
01:07:15.329 --> 01:07:16.953
You like what you see?

645
01:07:19.162 --> 01:07:22.037
Captain Wehninger told me
about a certain Chouchou,


646
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.953
waiting for him back home.

647
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:30.787
Chouchou.

648
01:07:30.871 --> 01:07:32.829
He talked about her.

649
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:37.245
Him or her... Nowadays...

650
01:07:37.329 --> 01:07:39.454
love is all that matters, right?

651
01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:42.787
You're Major Perg.

652
01:07:42.871 --> 01:07:45.995
You fought with August in the war
and were held captive with him.


653
01:07:48.077 --> 01:07:51.495
He always says,
"Perg and I,


654
01:07:51.578 --> 01:07:55.578
we were strong, because we knew
someone was waiting for us back home."


655
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:58.994
Did he spend the night here?

656
01:08:00.453 --> 01:08:03.953
Surely you aren't
alluding to unnatural fornication.


657
01:08:04.037 --> 01:08:05.287
Of course he didn't.

658
01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:08.412
That's forbidden
in our ever so modern republic.


659
01:08:08.494 --> 01:08:10.370
He's lying.

660
01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:16.370
Gentlemen, it was really fascinating,
but if you don't have a search warrant...


661
01:08:16.454 --> 01:08:19.245
We may contact you
for further questioning.


662
01:08:26.454 --> 01:08:28.454
He told me about you.

663
01:08:30.204 --> 01:08:32.953
He liked you. A friend.

664
01:08:34.037 --> 01:08:36.162
Apparently not enough of a friend,

665
01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:39.746
or he wouldn't have hidden
an important part of his life from me.


666
01:08:41.662 --> 01:08:43.829
Could you have dealt with it?

667
01:08:47.078 --> 01:08:51.245
Camaraderie, the glory
of the trenches...


668
01:08:51.329 --> 01:08:55.370
If you guys weren't so afraid
of touching one another in times of peace,


669
01:08:55.454 --> 01:08:58.162
we wouldn't need any wars.

670
01:08:58.245 --> 01:09:01.204
Give August a kiss from me.

671
01:09:01.287 --> 01:09:03.621
I'm sure you'll find him at the brewery.

672
01:09:08.204 --> 01:09:10.329
- Sorry.
- I didn't mean to. Sorry.


673
01:09:22.621 --> 01:09:25.912
Maybe a blown fuse. I don't know.

674
01:09:36.454 --> 01:09:38.579
August!

675
01:09:38.662 --> 01:09:40.370
It's me, Perg.

676
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:51.329
Captain Wehninger? Hello?

677
01:10:04.329 --> 01:10:06.454
Damn it, Hoffmann.

678
01:10:06.537 --> 01:10:08.454
Sorry.

679
01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:11.704
I found this. Over there.

680
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.120
- Chloroform.
- Yes.


681
01:10:25.204 --> 01:10:27.953
- Get back-up. Now.
- Yes, sir.


682
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.454
Watch out, Perg!

683
01:11:47.412 --> 01:11:48.953
Oh, God.

684
01:11:57.162 --> 01:12:00.371
So far we've found 18 blocks of ice
with body parts in them.


685
01:12:00.454 --> 01:12:03.245
- There are 19. Keep on looking.
- Yes, sir.


686
01:12:04.871 --> 01:12:07.995
The murderer wanted
to take revenge for 19 tortured men.


687
01:12:08.079 --> 01:12:10.579
But the interesting question is:

688
01:12:10.663 --> 01:12:12.871
What about number 20,

689
01:12:12.953 --> 01:12:15.412
the one who betrayed them
to the committee?


690
01:12:17.162 --> 01:12:18.912
The one who went crazy.

691
01:12:34.621 --> 01:12:38.829
- First Lieutenant, sir.
- Private. Come with me.


692
01:12:40.496 --> 01:12:43.204
I'm looking for Bauer.
Where is he?


693
01:12:43.287 --> 01:12:45.704
Trying to get an extra serving of food.

694
01:12:47.287 --> 01:12:50.120
We found Wehninger. Murdered.

695
01:12:52.204 --> 01:12:55.663
Krainer, Bernfeld, Richter.

696
01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:58.245
They're all dead.

697
01:12:58.329 --> 01:13:00.245
The committee?

698
01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:04.037
Where is Bauer?

699
01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.079
Where is he?

700
01:13:06.162 --> 01:13:10.246
You don't think that Bauer...
You know Bauer.


701
01:13:10.329 --> 01:13:13.496
- Listen. Listen to me, Kovacs.
- No. No.


702
01:13:13.579 --> 01:13:17.287
Maybe Bauer regrets the betrayal
and wants to get his revenge...


703
01:13:17.371 --> 01:13:19.746
- You know Bauer.
- ...and he's pretending!


704
01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:22.287
Bauer, tell them it's not true!

705
01:13:22.371 --> 01:13:24.412
That's him. Arrest him.

706
01:13:24.496 --> 01:13:27.246
- Move it! Go!
- No!


707
01:13:33.079 --> 01:13:35.246
Move away! Move away!

708
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:39.454
Soldier, stand to attention!

709
01:13:42.079 --> 01:13:43.995
Let the man go.

710
01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:49.037
Bauer, I just want to talk to you.
Calm down.


711
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.329
Nobody will be harmed.

712
01:13:52.371 --> 01:13:56.663
This is Hoffmann.
He's a good man. He's innocent.


713
01:13:59.162 --> 01:14:01.412
No more innocent deaths.

714
01:14:01.496 --> 01:14:03.246
You know that.

715
01:14:06.329 --> 01:14:08.079
It's our fault.

716
01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:12.454
- The dead comrades. I just wanted...
- I know.


717
01:14:14.162 --> 01:14:16.204
Let him go.

718
01:14:17.829 --> 01:14:20.204
Good.

719
01:14:20.287 --> 01:14:21.954
Let him go.

720
01:14:24.621 --> 01:14:26.329
Give me the knife.

721
01:14:31.746 --> 01:14:33.246
Bauer!

722
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:36.663
They shot him!

723
01:14:38.329 --> 01:14:40.538
The homefront cowards!

724
01:14:42.037 --> 01:14:43.788
Bauer!

725
01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:46.037
Bauer!

726
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.538
Are you one of them again?

727
01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.454
Who doesn't give
a shit about camaraderie?


728
01:14:52.538 --> 01:14:53.746
Step back, please.

729
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:56.746
- Out of the way, please.
- Perg!


730
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:58.162
Perg!

731
01:14:58.246 --> 01:15:00.704
- He's just a witness.
- I'll take care of him.


732
01:15:07.954 --> 01:15:10.246
Well done, Peter.

733
01:15:11.496 --> 01:15:16.329
That's the case solved, I would say.

734
01:15:16.412 --> 01:15:19.121
Welcome back to the police force.

735
01:15:19.204 --> 01:15:22.454
Full salary. And entitled to a pension.

736
01:15:31.204 --> 01:15:33.663
THE MURDERER WAS CAUGHT!

737
01:15:37.079 --> 01:15:39.412
BEAST OF VIENNA HAS BEEN SHOT!

738
01:16:01.162 --> 01:16:03.246
I owe you an explanation.

739
01:16:05.538 --> 01:16:07.413
I'm so sorry.

740
01:16:08.663 --> 01:16:10.413
My wife...

741
01:16:14.329 --> 01:16:16.621
We don't owe each other anything.

742
01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:25.912
I'm enjoying the time with you now.

743
01:16:25.995 --> 01:16:27.912
And tomorrow's another day.

744
01:16:38.871 --> 01:16:41.079
Is it that simple?

745
01:16:45.079 --> 01:16:46.538
No.

746
01:16:50.912 --> 01:16:53.329
It's awfully complicated, of course.

747
01:16:55.995 --> 01:16:58.538
But not while we're dancing in the Prater.

748
01:17:51.371 --> 01:17:53.079
Marlene.

749
01:18:14.037 --> 01:18:15.830
Stop! Police!

750
01:18:19.079 --> 01:18:22.037
"Homecomer beast shot dead!
Four murders!"


751
01:18:23.912 --> 01:18:24.996
Me?

752
01:18:29.912 --> 01:18:32.037
PEACE TO ALL PEOPLE

753
01:18:36.162 --> 01:18:38.204
Excuse me. Pardon.

754
01:18:39.246 --> 01:18:40.663
Sorry.

755
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:22.413
Hi, Peter.

756
01:19:27.663 --> 01:19:29.288
You?

757
01:19:45.621 --> 01:19:46.912
Where's my daughter?

758
01:19:48.121 --> 01:19:49.830
What have you done to her?

759
01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:55.162
Where is she?

760
01:19:55.246 --> 01:19:57.329
You can't threaten me anymore.

761
01:19:58.496 --> 01:20:00.496
I'm already dead.

762
01:20:07.163 --> 01:20:08.371
Give me the gun.

763
01:20:09.746 --> 01:20:11.830
Or you'll never know
what happened to your family.


764
01:20:15.413 --> 01:20:17.912
- No.
- Go on, give me the gun.


765
01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.996
Please. Where is she?

766
01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.996
Come.

767
01:20:38.121 --> 01:20:39.996
When was Bauer not with you yesterday?

768
01:20:41.121 --> 01:20:42.705
I told you already.

769
01:20:44.079 --> 01:20:46.329
I've got nothing to do with this.

770
01:20:49.954 --> 01:20:51.746
Ever heard of complicity?

771
01:20:55.663 --> 01:20:57.329
This way.

772
01:21:00.163 --> 01:21:01.621
There.

773
01:21:06.371 --> 01:21:07.996
Look.

774
01:21:12.538 --> 01:21:14.746
- Your wife.
- Anna.


775
01:21:18.621 --> 01:21:20.288
Her husband wrote
to say he's coming home


776
01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:23.705
and wants to see her straight away.

777
01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:31.329
Now her husband has sent her
another message.


778
01:21:33.329 --> 01:21:37.413
He wants to meet her at the peace mass
in St. Stephen's Cathedral.


779
01:21:39.079 --> 01:21:40.996
See that package?

780
01:21:41.079 --> 01:21:43.788
She doesn't know it's a mustard gas bomb.

781
01:21:43.872 --> 01:21:45.496
With a time fuse.

782
01:21:49.413 --> 01:21:52.288
If she goes in there,
a few thousand people will die.


783
01:21:52.371 --> 01:21:56.288
If you shoot her,
she'll barely notice it.


784
01:21:57.371 --> 01:21:58.996
Over.

785
01:22:00.288 --> 01:22:02.037
What do you think, Perg?

786
01:22:03.079 --> 01:22:05.496
It's even simpler than back then.

787
01:22:07.329 --> 01:22:10.621
One life in exchange
for a few thousand church attendees.


788
01:22:15.954 --> 01:22:19.580
Anna will die in any case.
Will it be a bullet or the gas?


789
01:22:19.663 --> 01:22:22.912
If you shoot the mother,
you'll save the child.


790
01:22:22.996 --> 01:22:25.538
Peter, come on. Shoot.

791
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:28.788
On the other hand,

792
01:22:28.872 --> 01:22:32.747
those fools down there believe
they can pray away the war and evil.


793
01:22:33.996 --> 01:22:36.246
Let them die.
They deserve it.


794
01:22:36.329 --> 01:22:37.996
Come on, shoot!

795
01:22:38.079 --> 01:22:40.496
Your pretty Ms. 
Doctor will comfort you.

796
01:22:42.204 --> 01:22:45.621
You only have seconds left.
Then it's too late, Peter.


797
01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:49.121
Come on, shoot.

798
01:22:49.204 --> 01:22:51.079
Go on, shoot!

799
01:22:52.163 --> 01:22:53.496
Shoot!

800
01:22:57.371 --> 01:23:00.038
I'd never harm an innocent child.

801
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:01.747
You goddamn...

802
01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.330
How did you know them?

803
01:23:09.413 --> 01:23:12.371
They're high-ranking officers,
you're a private.


804
01:23:13.872 --> 01:23:15.455
From the camp.

805
01:23:17.246 --> 01:23:19.246
They were on the committee.

806
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:23.496
Richter, Bernfeld, Wehninger,

807
01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.371
Heresmaty, Krainer...

808
01:23:27.455 --> 01:23:29.455
Krainer and Perg.

809
01:23:32.663 --> 01:23:34.912
Perg was a member of the committee?

810
01:23:46.163 --> 01:23:48.288
I was already laid
to rest with the dead.

811
01:23:50.038 --> 01:23:52.371
Shot like an animal.

812
01:23:53.371 --> 01:23:57.204
God let me survive
so I can pass on my pain.


813
01:23:57.288 --> 01:24:00.330
We were responsible for 50,000 men.

814
01:24:00.413 --> 01:24:02.038
Fifty thousand!

815
01:24:07.912 --> 01:24:09.413
Men?

816
01:24:10.996 --> 01:24:14.246
They were just cripples
and invalids waiting to die.


817
01:24:16.538 --> 01:24:18.413
But we...

818
01:24:18.496 --> 01:24:20.538
We would have had a chance.

819
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:25.121
My men, who you handed over
to the torturers.


820
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:28.538
I owe them this.

821
01:24:28.622 --> 01:24:31.538
Who are you to decide

822
01:24:31.622 --> 01:24:34.246
who can live and who must die?

823
01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:35.496
Are you God?

824
01:24:36.663 --> 01:24:38.705
God died in that war.

825
01:24:40.872 --> 01:24:43.204
Now I'm the god of revenge.

826
01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:47.330
I am the harbinger
of the next great killing.


827
01:25:24.205 --> 01:25:26.872
Bauer is no killer. Believe me.

828
01:25:26.954 --> 01:25:29.246
I do, and now I
know Perg is in danger.

829
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:31.496
If he's not dead already.

830
01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:33.330
- Are you Inspector Severin?
- Yes.


831
01:25:33.413 --> 01:25:37.079
A man sent me to tell you this:
"Perg and Pummerin."


832
01:25:37.163 --> 01:25:40.288
Pummerin?
The bell in St. Stephen's Cathedral?


833
01:25:40.371 --> 01:25:42.163
And "nineteen."

834
01:25:43.246 --> 01:25:45.330
Hoffmann, raise the alarm!

835
01:26:11.497 --> 01:26:14.121
You would've let thousands die
for your wife.


836
01:26:16.163 --> 01:26:18.288
But you didn't give a shit about us.

837
01:26:42.121 --> 01:26:45.497
Don't you understand that I have
to get revenge for my comrades?


838
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:53.497
What we did was wrong.

839
01:26:56.455 --> 01:26:59.330
Wrong because there was no right.

840
01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:12.330
There's nothing right
in this world anymore.


841
01:27:21.330 --> 01:27:23.455
Nineteen of us died because of you.

842
01:27:25.038 --> 01:27:26.371
Come here, Peter.

843
01:27:30.622 --> 01:27:32.371
But I'm more dead than the others.

844
01:27:33.538 --> 01:27:36.288
Remember how they killed
the young Meyerhofer?


845
01:27:39.163 --> 01:27:42.080
He was gutted alive.

846
01:27:49.705 --> 01:27:52.372
The way he screamed, it was horrific.

847
01:27:53.538 --> 01:27:56.246
Police! Open the door!

848
01:28:00.372 --> 01:28:02.288
Hoffmann, I'll go in alone.

849
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:09.872
Freeze!

850
01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.497
I think I shot him.

851
01:28:22.747 --> 01:28:23.913
I'll get the swine.

852
01:28:24.913 --> 01:28:26.830
Get back-up. Back-up!

853
01:28:28.163 --> 01:28:29.664
Wait.

854
01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:57.330
You don't want him
to do it, do you?

855
01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:00.330
Give me your gun.

856
01:29:04.163 --> 01:29:07.246
- Perg!
- Severin, stay where you are!


857
01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:10.205
Are you crazy?
Get out of the line of fire.


858
01:29:10.288 --> 01:29:13.080
- Severin, don't move.
- You shouldn't be here.


859
01:29:13.163 --> 01:29:15.913
What did he say?
Get out of my way, Perg!


860
01:29:15.996 --> 01:29:18.664
- Do what he says!
- You shut up!


861
01:29:18.747 --> 01:29:22.538
Severin, stay where you are!
I won't let you make him a killer.


862
01:29:22.622 --> 01:29:24.330
- Move aside!
- No!


863
01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:33.288
Josef!

864
01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:39.163
You... You shot me, little brother.

865
01:29:42.330 --> 01:29:44.705
Why... Why aren't you...

866
01:29:47.038 --> 01:29:48.872
I don't understand.

867
01:29:51.288 --> 01:29:52.664
What... What have I done?

868
01:29:55.872 --> 01:29:59.205
- You shot down a murderer.
- Josef.


869
01:30:00.747 --> 01:30:03.747
Come with me. Let's go home.

870
01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.705
Let's go home.

871
01:30:09.247 --> 01:30:12.205
Please! I... I've been looking for you.

872
01:30:12.288 --> 01:30:14.288
I did everything I could.

873
01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:19.955
I know.

874
01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:23.913
I'm so glad I
saw you one last time.

875
01:30:26.455 --> 01:30:28.580
Josef, come.

876
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:38.330
Perg, go to hell!

877
01:31:12.413 --> 01:31:14.038
You knew it.

878
01:31:17.413 --> 01:31:19.330
You knew it!

879
01:31:22.913 --> 01:31:24.705
You knew it.

880
01:31:32.372 --> 01:31:34.580
You should've told me.

881
01:31:44.664 --> 01:31:48.747
He wanted to believe
that his brother was a hero and I let him.


882
01:31:49.831 --> 01:31:51.455
Hero?

883
01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:57.080
First, you shoot each other in the war
and back home you shoot your comrades.


884
01:31:58.539 --> 01:32:01.789
It's easier to kill somebody
than risk leading a meaningful life.


885
01:32:03.288 --> 01:32:07.996
Is it so bad that you need
our pretty doctor to examine your corpse?


886
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:11.831
Don't look so sorry for yourself.
Our teamwork was fantastic.


887
01:32:11.913 --> 01:32:14.247
Doctor. Peter.

888
01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:16.955
See you Monday morning
when you start your job.


889
01:32:17.038 --> 01:32:18.247
I'll bring the pastries.

890
01:32:26.038 --> 01:32:30.288
All those years, all I could think of
was returning home and now...


891
01:32:39.038 --> 01:32:41.330
You can return to life.

892
01:32:43.913 --> 01:32:45.622
To a new life.

893
01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:55.205
It could be a wonderful life.

894
01:33:06.622 --> 01:33:10.080
I'm no longer the man I was
before I went to war.


895
01:33:15.330 --> 01:33:18.330
Anna is a different person
after all these years, too.


896
01:33:20.122 --> 01:33:24.664
I don't know if these two people
have anything in common now, but...


897
01:33:28.622 --> 01:33:30.913
If I don't try it now...
