"MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL IN LAW.

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:12.228
THEN THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN."

3
00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:14.311
<i>Hey?</i>

4
00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:15.645
<i>What?</i>

5
00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:19.686
<i>Ever wondered why reggae songs
always start with a drumroll?</i>


6
00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:22.853
<i>You serious?
You wanna talk about that now?</i>


7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.020
<i>You don't wanna know?</i>

8
00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:27.895
<i>Spill, if you're bursting to tell me.</i>

9
00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:33.103
<i>The drumroll is the sound of the cannons
bringing down the walls of Babylon.</i>


10
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:34.895
<i>What's Babylon?</i>

11
00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.728
<i>Babylon is a city
putrid with capitalism and corruption.</i>


12
00:00:39.728 --> 00:00:42.145
<i>Capitalists, don't worry.
I'll take care of them.</i>


13
00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:45.145
<i>What's he doing?</i>

14
00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:51.936
Look at that son
of a bitch. Go on.

15
00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:55.978
Shit!

BREUIL & SONS
NUMBER ONE IN CHARTRES


18
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.603
<i>My name is Daniel Sauveur.</i>

19
00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:57.061
<i>I was born in Chartres. 
Central France.</i>

20
00:01:59.103 --> 00:02:00.395
<i>In the middle of nowhere.</i>

21
00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:02.520
<i>My mom had one dream.</i>

22
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.353
<i>To have a view of the cathedral.</i>

23
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.103
<i>Even though it was from a distance,
Dad gave it to her before leaving us.</i>


24
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:13.061
<i>The Breuils took that too.</i>

25
00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:17.270
<i>The Breuils are
the most loaded family in town.</i>


26
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.561
<i>From father to son.</i>

27
00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.436
<i>There are Breuils in your town too.</i>

28
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.853
<i>The ones who crush you
with the heel of their shoes.</i>


29
00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.270
<i>They don't even mean to do it,
those idiots.</i>


30
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.478
<i>I learned that if you want a nice view,
there's no choice.</i>


31
00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:35.603
<i>You have to hustle to get to the top.
Especially on top of the Breuils.</i>


32
00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:40.561
<i>So I began to watch them
to understand how they got there.</i>


33
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.728
- <i>You know what?</i>
- Hi.


34
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.186
<i>There's nothing to understand.</i>

35
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.561
- Thinking of you.
- Thanks.


36
00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:49.436
<i>Some people are born with,
and some without. That's it.</i>


37
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.853
Your mother is waiting for you.

38
00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:53.811
<i>In Chartres, there's Breuil & Sons,</i>

39
00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:57.561
<i>and way further down,
there's everyone else.</i>


40
00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.853
<i>Every Wednesday, Breuil Sr. ate
at this place with his son, Patrick.</i>


41
00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:01.978
<i>The little one there.</i>

42
00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:06.061
<i>He probably doesn't know it,
but we went to the same elementary school.</i>


43
00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.561
- Two coffees for table four.
- I only have two hands!


44
00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:10.603
<i>This is Unc.</i>

45
00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:12.103
I have the veal!

46
00:03:12.186 --> 00:03:13.686
<i>- My father's best friend.</i>
- Go!


47
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.353
<i>He looked after us after he died.</i>

48
00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:16.436
- You seen the kid?
- No.


49
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.061
<i>Every Wednesday, I spent the day
with him here, at the Beaux Arts,</i>


50
00:03:21.145 --> 00:03:23.311
<i>the Michelin-starred restaurant.</i>

51
00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:26.186
- I told you to stay in the kitchen.
- Look, Unc.


52
00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.020
Look at the woman, table 25.

53
00:03:29.103 --> 00:03:30.145
Mrs. Breuil?

54
00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:33.061
You see her bag? She's left it behind
two Wednesdays in a row.


55
00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:34.728
- So what?
- I have a plan.


56
00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:38.145
Mrs. Breuil! You forgot your bag, madam.

57
00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:41.020
Thanks, that's kind. For you.

58
00:03:41.103 --> 00:03:42.145
Mom.

59
00:03:44.728 --> 00:03:45.728
Here.

60
00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.478
<i>When you're from Chartres,
you learn it early on.</i>


61
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.645
<i>The Breuils always win.</i>

62
00:03:57.978 --> 00:04:00.686
<i>There was a time
when people started naming their kids</i>


63
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.103
<i>after their favorite brands.</i>

64
00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:05.686
<i>That's how my best friend
found himself with the name Scania.</i>


65
00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:07.186
<i>Like the trucks.</i>

66
00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:09.270
<i>He hated the Breuils too.</i>

67
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.061
<i>His dad worked as a trucker for them,
so he never got to see him.</i>


68
00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:14.645
<i>When I lost my father,</i>

69
00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:17.561
<i>some kids at school
started calling me "bastard."</i>


70
00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:20.228
<i>And Scania made them pay every time.</i>

71
00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:23.270
<i>So I share everything with him.</i>

72
00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:24.353
<i>Fifty-fifty.</i>

73
00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:26.228
Hey, see you.

74
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:27.270
<i>When we got older,</i>

75
00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:30.936
<i>we swore never to work for the Breuils
like our fathers had.</i>


76
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.686
<i>We set up our own business.</i>

77
00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:34.645
<i>It wasn't dumb. 
It worked.</i>

78
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.853
All right, Coz?

79
00:04:37.936 --> 00:04:40.645
<i>Except that here, all roads lead to...</i>

80
00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:42.686
Breuil & Sons of bitches.

81
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.478
<i>Like everyone else,
we ended up working for the Breuils.</i>


82
00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:46.520
<i>Way too much.</i>

83
00:04:46.603 --> 00:04:48.895
Over 90% of your turnover comes from us.

84
00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:53.353
Economic dependence.
Sorry. I don't make the rules.


85
00:04:53.853 --> 00:04:55.186
Hey, give me that!

86
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.853
<i>Economic dependence is when
you do too much business with one client.</i>


87
00:04:59.936 --> 00:05:02.353
- <i>Apparently, that's not good.</i>
- Let go!


88
00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:05.311
Stop.

89
00:05:06.353 --> 00:05:07.270
Get lost!

90
00:05:07.353 --> 00:05:10.645
<i>Because we didn't have any other clients
and owed money to the bank,</i>


91
00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:12.353
<i>we were done for.</i>

92
00:05:15.603 --> 00:05:16.895
<i>We had no choice.</i>

93
00:05:17.853 --> 00:05:20.186
<i>Scania had to take a job
as a driver for Breuil.</i>


94
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.186
<i>I held out another three months,
but a man's gotta eat, right?</i>


95
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.936
What the hell are you doing?
Smoke break's over. Give me that.


96
00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:29.561
That's him.

97
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.895
Is that him?

98
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:39.561
Daniel Sauveur, sir.

99
00:05:39.645 --> 00:05:42.728
- Save the formality. Call me "boss."
- Boss.


100
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:45.395
Have you told your buddy how things work?

101
00:05:46.103 --> 00:05:47.186
How things work?

102
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.353
Let me explain.

103
00:05:48.436 --> 00:05:51.311
I have free rein
over who I hire and fire around here.


104
00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:54.936
I'll give you
a short-term contract for six months.


105
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.395
At the end of that, Breuil Sr.
will pay you a 10% indemnity, 900 euros.


106
00:05:59.478 --> 00:06:02.311
That's it? 900 euros and no trade-offs?

107
00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.520
It's the law, but don't get excited.

108
00:06:05.103 --> 00:06:07.395
You're going to give me
that bonus in cash.


109
00:06:07.478 --> 00:06:11.103
- 50% now, 50% at the end of the contract.
- What?


110
00:06:11.186 --> 00:06:13.520
Otherwise, I'll fire you
during your trial period.


111
00:06:13.603 --> 00:06:15.353
Pay up and I'll keep you on.

112
00:06:15.436 --> 00:06:17.978
Same thing,

113
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.686
But I don't have 450 euros right now.
I've got nothing.


114
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.728
Your buddy said he'd take care of it.

115
00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.020
Thanks.

116
00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:35.645
- Why are you giving money to that wimp?
- This way, you have a job.


117
00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:40.145
<i>And that's how, after taking over
the whole town, the Breuils got me too.</i>


118
00:06:42.145 --> 00:06:44.895
<i>The locals see working here as a step-up.</i>

119
00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:47.270
<i>They reckon
they're doing something high-end.</i>


120
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.145
<i>The global distribution
of Parisian luxury.</i>


121
00:06:51.228 --> 00:06:53.603
<i>The quintessence of the French psyche.</i>

122
00:06:54.478 --> 00:06:56.520
<i>Givenchy, Dior, 
Saint Laurent.</i>

123
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.936
<i>The whole shebang.
Anyway, you get the picture.</i>


124
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.353
<i>In reality, those luxury brands
send their perfume to Breuil in cubes,</i>


125
00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:09.936
<i>and we put them in bottles,
boxes, cardboard boxes, and pallets.</i>


126
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.853
<i>Then we deliver them
to big clients across the world.</i>


127
00:07:13.853 --> 00:07:16.353
<i>I started out
in quality control for Colin Brown.</i>


128
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.270
<i>It's a big American luxury brand.</i>

129
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.311
<i>You know? The black and white ads
with guys and chicks in jeans.</i>


130
00:07:23.395 --> 00:07:25.103
<i>I've seen it all come through.</i>

131
00:07:25.186 --> 00:07:26.478
<i>CB Gold, of course.</i>

132
00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:29.728
<i>CB X-treme,
when techno was back on the club scene.</i>


133
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:32.311
<i>CB Green for the eco-friendly crowd.</i>

134
00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:35.770
<i>I even saw CB Red when guys wanted
to smell nice to work out.</i>


135
00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:38.978
<i>You think I'm kidding? I'm not.</i>

136
00:08:07.728 --> 00:08:09.145
Excuse me?

137
00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:10.770
What's going on here?

138
00:08:11.686 --> 00:08:13.061
The old guy croaked.

139
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:15.645
<i>Breuil?</i>

140
00:08:24.853 --> 00:08:28.520
<i>Let's just say that if there was
one less Breuil in the world, I was in.</i>


141
00:08:28.603 --> 00:08:31.978
<i>But don't forget, the Breuils always win.</i>

142
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.186
<i>At my age,
having done nothing to deserve it,</i>


143
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.353
<i>little Patrick became the big boss.</i>

144
00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:43.811
<i>His future was all mapped out,
while I didn't have one.</i>


145
00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:46.478
<i>Even so,
that's when everything changed for me.</i>


146
00:08:46.561 --> 00:08:48.895
Hello. Béatrice Breuil, 
Patrick's wife.

147
00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:52.853
A gift to celebrate his taking over
as head of the company.


148
00:08:52.936 --> 00:08:54.186
A Bois d'Argent fragrance.

149
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.520
- Hello.
- Hi.


150
00:08:56.853 --> 00:08:58.936
- A little gift from our family.
- Thanks.


151
00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:06.020
What about you, Daniel?

152
00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:09.936
How's it going with the perfumers?
Is the son any better than the father?


153
00:09:11.145 --> 00:09:12.186
Not sure.

154
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.145
They're really taking it out of you.

155
00:09:15.228 --> 00:09:17.395
Yeah. They wear us out.

156
00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:22.145
Guess what your mom and I heard
on the local news last night?


157
00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:26.895
<i>A few liters of perfume concentrate can go
for the same price as a kilo of gold.</i>


158
00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:30.936
Fuck. At that price,
you'd better smell good.


159
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.520
<i>A bit of water with some kind
of dumb flower juice... 30,000 smackers.</i>


160
00:09:35.603 --> 00:09:37.436
<i>Those guys think they're so fancy.</i>

161
00:09:50.186 --> 00:09:52.936
YOUR SALE PRICE - 50 €

162
00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:17.353
INTERESTED IN THE COLIN BROWN!

163
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:46.353
Scania, I've been watching them for days,
I'm telling you.


164
00:10:46.436 --> 00:10:49.561
There's only one time
when the boxes don't ring at the gate.


165
00:10:49.645 --> 00:10:51.436
There's piles of money to be made.

166
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.228
Enough with that bullshit.

167
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:56.395
I sold one bottle online.
I made 50 euros in one second.


168
00:10:56.478 --> 00:10:58.645
Why would we miss out
on a gold mine like that?


169
00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:02.603
Tell me. What do we have to lose here?
I'm doing it, so do it.


170
00:11:03.228 --> 00:11:05.395
What are you doing about Kowalski?

171
00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:08.603
That Polack's the one
who's gonna let us into the chicken coop.


172
00:11:08.686 --> 00:11:11.020
- I know how to handle him.
- You're killing me.


173
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.645
I'm throwing pearls before swine with you.

174
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:19.645
Evening, Patrick.

175
00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:23.895
Jacques
-Yves. I'm pleased you could come.

176
00:11:23.978 --> 00:11:25.228
He'd have been touched.

177
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:30.061
You should be proud.
Armand was a front-runner to the end.


178
00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:32.270
Thanks, Jacques
-Yves.

179
00:11:32.353 --> 00:11:36.686
None of that between us, now that we'll be
seeing more of each other.


180
00:11:37.978 --> 00:11:40.061
- How so?
- I'll swing by from time to time.


181
00:11:40.145 --> 00:11:43.270
To see that our products
are still getting the same treatment.


182
00:11:43.353 --> 00:11:45.603
I'd like to introduce you to Béatrice.

183
00:11:47.936 --> 00:11:48.770
Béa.

184
00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:55.853
My wife, Béatrice.
Jacques-Yves Rousseau from Colin Brown.


185
00:11:55.936 --> 00:11:57.020
Nice to meet you.

186
00:11:57.103 --> 00:11:59.395
- My pleasure.
- And...


187
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.811
Brice Nougarolis, Parfums VIP.

188
00:12:01.895 --> 00:12:05.103
Yes, the online discounter.
We know who you are.


189
00:12:37.436 --> 00:12:41.436
Boss! One of your Polacks ran over
one of my boxes with his Fenwick.


190
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.561
- Polack?
- Yeah.


191
00:12:43.103 --> 00:12:43.936
Hold on.

192
00:12:44.686 --> 00:12:46.395
- "One of my Polacks"?
- Yeah.


193
00:12:46.478 --> 00:12:47.811
You know what, Sauveur?

194
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.811
From now on, it won't be my Polacks
taking care of the trash.


195
00:12:51.895 --> 00:12:54.395
It's going to be you,
my little French helper.


196
00:12:54.895 --> 00:12:57.311
You can start right now. 
Get rid of this.

197
00:13:02.145 --> 00:13:05.728
<i>As David Douillet would say,
stupidity is like judo.</i>


198
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:06.645
Dick.

199
00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:08.936
<i>You need to use your opponent's strength.</i>

200
00:13:09.686 --> 00:13:10.811
- Sauveur?
- Yeah.


201
00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:12.228
He's a dick, boss.

202
00:13:16.603 --> 00:13:18.978
Hello. I'm going to the incinerator.

203
00:13:36.353 --> 00:13:37.520
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.


204
00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:54.895
<i>Take people who work in offices.</i>

205
00:13:55.395 --> 00:13:59.520
<i>They take pens home for their kids
to have something to draw with.</i>


206
00:13:59.603 --> 00:14:01.603
<i>You don't have a problem with that, right?</i>

207
00:14:02.103 --> 00:14:05.186
<i>Scania and I work in perfume,
and we don't have kids.</i>


208
00:14:05.686 --> 00:14:06.603
<i>Same thing.</i>

209
00:14:27.478 --> 00:14:30.270
<i>In six months, we made 10,000 smackers
each by selling online.</i>


210
00:14:31.895 --> 00:14:36.270
<i>I was able to help out Unc and Mom.
And Scania bought me a rollie.</i>


211
00:14:36.353 --> 00:14:37.311
Enjoying life?

212
00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:13.603
Hey!

213
00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:15.561
Go fuck yourself.

214
00:15:23.603 --> 00:15:25.436
May I buy you a drink?

215
00:15:26.228 --> 00:15:27.936
Yeah? Hey! A couple of mojitos!

216
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.395
- Two? Got it.
- Thanks.


217
00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:32.436
I'm a regular here.

218
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.103
How come I've never seen
that lovely face before?


219
00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:37.020
I just moved back to Chartres.

220
00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:37.936
Yeah?

221
00:15:38.478 --> 00:15:41.811
People usually tend to leave.

222
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:43.811
What brought you back?

223
00:15:43.895 --> 00:15:45.561
- Work.
- Perfume?


224
00:15:47.228 --> 00:15:48.061
Like everyone.

225
00:15:49.478 --> 00:15:50.978
- Like me.
- Oh yeah?


226
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:52.645
- Yeah.
- For whom?


227
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.728
For whom? For myself.
I launched a small start-up.


228
00:15:57.811 --> 00:16:01.186
I'm selling luxury brands at a discount.

229
00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:03.728
For now. Down the line, who knows.

230
00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:08.103
Growth is good for now.
Exponential, you could say.


231
00:16:08.978 --> 00:16:14.561
At the beginning,
we were more into B2B licensing,


232
00:16:15.645 --> 00:16:19.228
wanting to move into B2C,
so we went with the US straightaway.


233
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:23.645
Then we thought, in the medium term,
why not totally flood the metaverse,


234
00:16:23.728 --> 00:16:26.353
directly on the Internet, too,

235
00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:30.061
in the peripheral, secondary universes.

236
00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:33.311
And so now we're trying to...

237
00:16:33.395 --> 00:16:38.186
You've got to take a break, too, you know.
We're having a few parties with friends.


238
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.645
To blow off some steam, you know.

239
00:16:41.728 --> 00:16:45.770
Because we've just taken three million,
me and my friend over there.


240
00:16:46.936 --> 00:16:48.811
He's a mediocre dancer,

241
00:16:48.895 --> 00:16:51.645
but he's bought himself
a nice little shack for 1,5 million


242
00:16:51.728 --> 00:16:53.061
on the Opal Coast.

243
00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:56.978
He bought it with cash, just like that.

244
00:16:57.686 --> 00:17:01.603
And there's a whole group of us
in the incubator.


245
00:17:01.686 --> 00:17:06.395
Kind of like modern-day "golden boys,"
without the guns.


246
00:17:06.478 --> 00:17:08.895
We said to ourselves, "We might go crazy."

247
00:17:08.978 --> 00:17:12.395
That's the risk, so we'd better not.
So, what do you think?


248
00:17:13.061 --> 00:17:15.103
- What do you think?
- About?


249
00:17:15.186 --> 00:17:18.645
How about we go for dinner
at the Beaux Arts? Monday at 8:00 p.m.?


250
00:17:19.561 --> 00:17:20.603
No.

251
00:17:21.186 --> 00:17:22.311
- 8:30?
- Thanks.


252
00:17:22.395 --> 00:17:23.936
8:30? A little later?

253
00:17:50.895 --> 00:17:51.853
Hey!

254
00:17:51.936 --> 00:17:54.520
<i>Amigo,</i> is that a Rorolove you have there?
Let me see.


255
00:17:54.603 --> 00:17:57.061
My mother gave it
to me for my birthday.

256
00:17:57.145 --> 00:17:58.770
- Give it or you're out.
- No, boss.


257
00:17:58.853 --> 00:18:01.978
Your contract is up for renewal.
You're two days late. My 500 smackers?


258
00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:03.353
I'll pay you tomorrow.

259
00:18:04.895 --> 00:18:05.978
I don't do credit.

260
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.603
There you go. Perfect.

261
00:18:12.895 --> 00:18:15.603
I wouldn't have wanted
to put someone else on trash duty.


262
00:18:16.436 --> 00:18:18.186
Trash really suits you.

263
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.603
Go on, move it.

264
00:18:22.645 --> 00:18:23.561
Son of a bitch.

265
00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:37.186
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS

266
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.103
What?

267
00:18:39.728 --> 00:18:42.395
USERS HAVE REPORTED
THE SALE OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS


268
00:18:48.936 --> 00:18:49.770
Bastards.

269
00:18:52.686 --> 00:18:53.520
Daniel?

270
00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:56.853
Fuck.

271
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.561
Daniel?

272
00:19:03.145 --> 00:19:04.186
Yeah?

273
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.770
- Come down!
- Yeah!


274
00:19:18.728 --> 00:19:23.311
Lt. Fayard, national police.
We were called in by the customs service.


275
00:19:23.811 --> 00:19:24.645
Customs?

276
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:28.311
You must be mistaken.
I've never crossed a border in my life.


277
00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:31.020
I think you must have the wrong address.

278
00:19:34.395 --> 00:19:35.478
Do you have a computer?

279
00:19:36.311 --> 00:19:37.145
No.

280
00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:42.811
What's your job, Daniel?

281
00:19:42.895 --> 00:19:45.145
I work on the Breuil assembly line.

282
00:19:45.228 --> 00:19:46.061
Breuil?

283
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:51.061
Doesn't mean a thing. The whole town
works in perfume, so it's not...


284
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:55.770
Who mentioned perfume?

285
00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.686
You asked whether I worked for Breuil.
We make perfume, so I said "perfume."


286
00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.728
Does lebonplan. fr mean anything to you?

287
00:20:06.853 --> 00:20:10.895
Is that why you're...
Okay. So, it's very...


288
00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:13.770
So Breuil Jr. took over the company.

289
00:20:14.603 --> 00:20:20.395
His wife, very kindly,
gave a bottle to all the employees.


290
00:20:20.478 --> 00:20:24.478
And because I don't use that scent,

291
00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:28.561
I thought I'd sell it online.

292
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.061
So I sold it for 50 euros.

293
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.270
It's true that I
told my friends about it.

294
00:20:37.811 --> 00:20:40.728
And so everyone wanted me to sell theirs.

295
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:45.270
But it was really temporary.

296
00:20:45.353 --> 00:20:48.811
I mean, I wasn't planning
to have a business, you know.


297
00:20:49.978 --> 00:20:53.728
That might be why you saw multiple sales.

298
00:20:57.853 --> 00:20:59.686
- Online?
- Online, yeah.


299
00:21:02.061 --> 00:21:02.936
Without a computer?

300
00:21:03.978 --> 00:21:07.936
Without... Yeah.
Someone lent one to me just for that.


301
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.853
- We've never had one.
- Yeah.


302
00:21:13.353 --> 00:21:16.603
Actually, it'd be useful
to get one to buy stuff.


303
00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:19.228
Fencing counterfeit goods
gets you five years.


304
00:21:19.936 --> 00:21:21.520
And a 375,000 euro fine.

305
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:27.770
I'll stay in line.

306
00:21:38.645 --> 00:21:40.895
I can't call you.
The cops put a tap on my phone.


307
00:21:40.978 --> 00:21:42.520
What are you talking about?

308
00:21:42.603 --> 00:21:44.228
They searched the house.

309
00:21:44.311 --> 00:21:46.936
They know about the Internet deal.
It's over.


310
00:21:47.603 --> 00:21:49.686
What do I do with
the 200 bottles I have?

311
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.728
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

312
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:55.478
We need to make some money.
I need to leave Mom's place.


313
00:21:55.561 --> 00:21:57.811
I'm not going to get her
involved in our mess.


314
00:21:57.895 --> 00:21:58.895
It's Kowalski.

315
00:21:58.978 --> 00:22:00.145
Go.

316
00:22:31.978 --> 00:22:32.811
Come in.

317
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.561
I don't have you on my calendar,
Mr. Sauveur.


318
00:22:40.436 --> 00:22:42.603
You know my name? 
Did you look for it?

319
00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:43.811
I'm the head of HR.

320
00:22:44.603 --> 00:22:45.686
Really? Right.

321
00:22:47.436 --> 00:22:49.395
- Take a seat.
- Yes, thanks.


322
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.145
Weird that we haven't run into each other
in the halls before.


323
00:22:58.061 --> 00:22:59.811
So, where were you before?

324
00:22:59.895 --> 00:23:02.020
I was with Breuil in the Paris office.

325
00:23:02.103 --> 00:23:04.853
Then Mr. Breuil called me in
as general manager.


326
00:23:04.936 --> 00:23:06.686
Right, GM, okay.

327
00:23:08.228 --> 00:23:09.811
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.


328
00:23:12.686 --> 00:23:14.686
Did you end up
going with that other guy?

329
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.186
- Let's not discuss that.
- No?


330
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.103
- No.
- No.


331
00:23:17.186 --> 00:23:18.020
Anything else?

332
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.103
No, I just came to set things straight.

333
00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:23.020
No need.

334
00:23:23.103 --> 00:23:27.561
Just for me, just to tell you
that this whole Internet thing...


335
00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:32.895
I'd been drinking,
so I was talking nonsense.


336
00:23:33.728 --> 00:23:36.020
I don't even own a computer, so it's...

337
00:23:36.728 --> 00:23:39.436
It didn't make any sense.
It was totally ridiculous.


338
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.645
So I wanted to apologize.

339
00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:46.770
Drinking makes people exaggerate.

340
00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:50.145
- Do you see...
- Not really.


341
00:23:50.228 --> 00:23:53.645
I have a meeting in five minutes.
You've set things straight, so that's it.


342
00:23:53.728 --> 00:23:56.811
We'll have an opportunity
to discuss your personal development.


343
00:23:58.186 --> 00:23:59.061
Got it, madam.

344
00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.561
Just one last little thing.

345
00:24:01.645 --> 00:24:03.895
About the dinner, are we still on?

346
00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:04.811
No.

347
00:24:05.395 --> 00:24:06.520
- No?
- No.


348
00:24:07.061 --> 00:24:10.770
- I don't mix business and personal.
- Is it because I'm a warehouse worker?


349
00:24:11.728 --> 00:24:12.853
I never said that.

350
00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:19.020
It's just a bit hurtful.
But, hey, you get used to it.


351
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.811
- I'll pick you up at 8:00 p.m., babe?
- What are you doing?


352
00:24:27.895 --> 00:24:30.020
- Have dinner with me.
- Are you crazy?


353
00:24:30.103 --> 00:24:32.186
A quick meal. What's the harm?

354
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.561
We'll see, but not here.

355
00:24:33.645 --> 00:24:34.811
- We'll see?
- Get out.


356
00:24:34.895 --> 00:24:37.145
- "We'll see" means "we'll see."
- Leave.


357
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.811
You didn't eat them last time.
They got left in the fridge.


358
00:24:48.853 --> 00:24:49.686
Hello.

359
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:55.395
Ladies and gents, all the Apple products!

360
00:24:55.478 --> 00:24:59.895
iPhone, iPad, all the best Apple packages,
get them here!


361
00:24:59.978 --> 00:25:02.645
We've got luxury watches and glasses, sir!

362
00:25:02.728 --> 00:25:05.020
Thirty euros.
It's not expensive. They're quality.


363
00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:07.228
It's French. A luxury product.

364
00:25:07.311 --> 00:25:09.395
The latest iPhone, get it here!

365
00:25:09.478 --> 00:25:13.061
- For 350 euros, it's yours, my friend.
- Is it real, at least?


366
00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:14.270
It's 350 euros.

367
00:25:14.853 --> 00:25:15.895
I only have 300.

368
00:25:16.728 --> 00:25:19.645
Give me the 300. That's great. All right.

369
00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:22.145
Have a good day. 
It's not expensive!

370
00:25:22.228 --> 00:25:24.103
Sir, this is the real thing.

371
00:25:25.936 --> 00:25:27.353
All the Apple products!

372
00:25:27.436 --> 00:25:29.936
- I'm going to the truck.
- iPad! iPhone!


373
00:25:30.728 --> 00:25:33.186
Get them here! 
Sir, anything you like?

374
00:25:57.145 --> 00:25:59.020
- Trying to screw us over?
- Not the teeth!


375
00:25:59.103 --> 00:26:01.061
- Who are you, you little bastard?
- Stop!


376
00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:04.145
Stop!

377
00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:05.686
Tell me when it's 30.

378
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.520
You tell me when to start counting!

379
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.936
The asshole's getting away!

380
00:26:10.478 --> 00:26:14.103
Guys, stop!
I have 200 perfumes worth 100 euros!


381
00:26:14.186 --> 00:26:16.561
Sell them for 50.
You'll make 5,000 in a weekend!


382
00:26:16.645 --> 00:26:17.770
You think I believe you?

383
00:26:18.561 --> 00:26:21.478
They're luxury products, guys!
Colin Brown, come on!


384
00:26:23.478 --> 00:26:26.228
- Why didn't you say?
- Why didn't you talk to us at the stall?


385
00:26:26.311 --> 00:26:28.853
- I didn't dare.
- Come on, get up. What nonsense.


386
00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:32.186
<i>That's how I replaced the Internet
with Titou and Raoul.</i>


387
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.645
<i>You have to admit,
there's nothing better than buying local.</i>


388
00:26:58.061 --> 00:26:58.895
Right.

389
00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:03.061
Let's say 50% at
the end of every month.

390
00:27:03.145 --> 00:27:05.770
Boss, it's our first time doing this.

391
00:27:06.353 --> 00:27:07.561
- First time.
- Yes.


392
00:27:09.353 --> 00:27:12.270
You take 15 units ten times a week.

393
00:27:12.895 --> 00:27:15.686
600 units per month at 60 euros apiece.

394
00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:19.353
That means my cut is 18,000.

395
00:27:23.228 --> 00:27:25.770
We don't sell for
60 euros a unit, boss.

396
00:27:31.728 --> 00:27:33.436
You're a real asshole, Sauveur.

397
00:27:34.478 --> 00:27:35.311
Right?

398
00:27:37.311 --> 00:27:38.353
What are you doing?

399
00:27:42.311 --> 00:27:43.145
Tomorrow.

400
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.645
Fuck, tomorrow.

401
00:27:49.686 --> 00:27:50.520
Don't worry.

402
00:27:56.478 --> 00:27:58.478
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- It's us.


403
00:28:02.561 --> 00:28:04.270
He's coming out for the money.

404
00:28:10.686 --> 00:28:12.103
Come in. Not outside.

405
00:28:12.728 --> 00:28:15.061
I didn't think losers like you were
the type to save.


406
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.145
- Asshole.
- Come here!


407
00:28:20.978 --> 00:28:22.520
Hold on! Daniel!

408
00:28:22.603 --> 00:28:23.811
Relax! Stop.

409
00:28:23.895 --> 00:28:25.395
Damn it, it's broken.

410
00:28:25.478 --> 00:28:27.478
- I'm going to send you to jail.
- Shut up.


411
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.395
Scania's cousin works for Social Security.

412
00:28:30.478 --> 00:28:33.103
He loved your short-term contract deal.
Here, call him.


413
00:28:33.186 --> 00:28:35.145
- Yes.
- We'll explain it all to him.


414
00:28:35.228 --> 00:28:37.270
You're going to tell him
that it's not right.


415
00:28:37.353 --> 00:28:38.728
- Here.
- Okay, I get it.


416
00:28:38.811 --> 00:28:39.811
- You got it?
- Yes.


417
00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:42.353
Here's a six-month disability claim.

418
00:28:43.603 --> 00:28:44.686
I'll take this back.

419
00:28:45.561 --> 00:28:47.270
It was mine. Let's not argue over it.

420
00:28:48.145 --> 00:28:48.978
There.

421
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.353
You keep your mouth shut.
We'll keep business running, okay?


422
00:28:53.895 --> 00:28:54.853
Jesus.

423
00:28:55.436 --> 00:28:57.561
<i>In the time it took Breuil
to replace Kowalski,</i>


424
00:28:57.645 --> 00:28:59.020
<i>we had an open playing field.</i>

425
00:28:59.103 --> 00:29:01.020
<i>We increased our numbers</i>

426
00:29:01.103 --> 00:29:03.520
<i>to the point that
my guys at the market...</i>

427
00:29:03.603 --> 00:29:05.811
Get a Kangoo! What's this thing?

428
00:29:05.895 --> 00:29:07.311
<i>...they struggled to keep up.</i>

429
00:29:12.978 --> 00:29:15.603
<i>As for me,
I finally got to leave my mom's place</i>


430
00:29:15.686 --> 00:29:18.728
<i>and rent my own house in Croix
-Bonnard</i>

431
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:21.020
<i>where the Cosmetic Valley executives live.</i>

432
00:29:21.103 --> 00:29:23.936
Do you like it, Mr. Sauveur?
The appliances are new.


433
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.020
- Is it all in good order?
- Everything is perfect.


434
00:29:27.103 --> 00:29:28.811
- Perfect.
- Is the file okay?


435
00:29:28.895 --> 00:29:31.478
- Great.
- Enjoy your well-deserved holiday.


436
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:34.478
You'll be comfy here, right?

437
00:29:35.395 --> 00:29:36.228
To Breuil.

438
00:29:45.436 --> 00:29:48.811
So, with this robotic inventory system,

439
00:29:48.895 --> 00:29:52.520
robots scan all the boxes
but not their contents?


440
00:29:52.603 --> 00:29:54.686
That's right, Miss Van Stratten.

441
00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.770
Some of the products won't be monitored.

442
00:29:56.853 --> 00:29:59.103
1,1% across the entire stock.

443
00:29:59.853 --> 00:30:01.270
- Marginal.
- Marginal?


444
00:30:01.853 --> 00:30:05.353
1,1% is a lot of products
with the massive numbers we handle.


445
00:30:05.853 --> 00:30:07.978
If we want to stay in the race,

446
00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:09.728
or even, let's go crazy,

447
00:30:09.811 --> 00:30:11.353
if we want to win this race,

448
00:30:11.436 --> 00:30:14.020
we have to move more products
more quickly.


449
00:30:14.103 --> 00:30:17.436
So I'm the only one here who sees

450
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.770
that 1,1% of the 4,5 million perfumes
we handle a year


451
00:30:22.436 --> 00:30:25.478
represents over 2 million euros worth
of perfume that's unmonitored.


452
00:30:25.978 --> 00:30:30.186
Or you're the only one who doesn't see
that we're monitoring 200 million euros.


453
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.645
Stéphane is right. Innovation has always
been part of the company's DNA.


454
00:30:42.186 --> 00:30:45.145
It's a green light from me.
Thank you, everyone.


455
00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:48.103
Thanks, Patrick.

456
00:31:05.061 --> 00:31:06.561
Are you getting settled?

457
00:31:08.728 --> 00:31:11.895
I gave the green light
to a project to digitalize the inventory.


458
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.770
It should allow us to grow.

459
00:31:16.186 --> 00:31:17.020
But, yeah...

460
00:31:25.186 --> 00:31:27.936
I've wanted to ask you something,
but I was waiting for...


461
00:31:30.353 --> 00:31:31.186
For what?

462
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:37.395
I've always known that
you weren't made for taking over Breuil.


463
00:31:39.353 --> 00:31:41.395
That your father was pushing it a bit.

464
00:31:43.311 --> 00:31:44.561
What's your question?

465
00:31:46.395 --> 00:31:50.145
The other day at the Beaux Arts,
Brice Nougarolis put an idea in my head.


466
00:31:50.228 --> 00:31:51.561
Nougarolis?

467
00:31:52.436 --> 00:31:54.436
What the hell was he doing there?

468
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.853
He's a perfume discounter.
Everything Dad hated.


469
00:31:59.353 --> 00:32:01.645
The biggest online retailer in Europe.

470
00:32:02.478 --> 00:32:05.478
- You want me to go online. Is that it?
- I'm being serious.


471
00:32:08.436 --> 00:32:09.395
So what, then?

472
00:32:10.478 --> 00:32:15.020
He said that he'd give everything
to be in your shoes,


473
00:32:15.103 --> 00:32:18.103
at the helm of a big cruise liner,
something stupid like that.


474
00:32:18.686 --> 00:32:20.520
I'm not following. 
What's this about?

475
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.603
I think Nougarolis would buy Breuil.

476
00:32:25.561 --> 00:32:27.186
Dad and Grandad's company?

477
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.186
Your father is dead.
Your grandad for even longer.


478
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.603
You want to sell and then do what?

479
00:32:34.936 --> 00:32:35.936
Whatever we want.

480
00:32:37.936 --> 00:32:40.145
Your dad always got in the way
of your plans.


481
00:32:41.895 --> 00:32:44.686
But that's over now. So sell.

482
00:32:45.645 --> 00:32:47.561
Don't you see? 
This is what we need.

483
00:32:48.145 --> 00:32:49.145
A fresh start.

484
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:53.103
You mean the three of us?

485
00:32:55.311 --> 00:32:56.686
Are you talking about kids?

486
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.895
- Everything is copied there?
- Right.


487
00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:21.811
- Hello, Sauveur.
- Hi.


488
00:33:21.895 --> 00:33:23.645
- How are you?
- What's going on here?


489
00:33:24.145 --> 00:33:25.603
I have some good news.

490
00:33:25.686 --> 00:33:29.603
Your job is going to be taken over
by a foolproof scanner


491
00:33:29.686 --> 00:33:32.228
that won't get tired of
watching the products.


492
00:33:32.311 --> 00:33:34.145
I don't get tired. 
I'm fulfilled.

493
00:33:34.228 --> 00:33:37.186
I said it at the last meeting.
I don't want to change roles.


494
00:33:37.936 --> 00:33:41.186
It's always the same with your lot.
You complain before you understand.


495
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.061
Kowalski is on disability.

496
00:33:43.145 --> 00:33:45.061
So you'll get the assistant role.

497
00:33:45.645 --> 00:33:49.061
You'll support Lablonde,
who will replace him in stock management.


498
00:33:49.145 --> 00:33:50.395
You're getting promoted.

499
00:33:50.478 --> 00:33:54.270
I don't want it. HR didn't even warn me.
Is this mandatory?


500
00:33:54.353 --> 00:33:55.853
It was agreed at the top.

501
00:33:56.686 --> 00:33:58.186
- Breuil?
- Yes, Patrick.


502
00:34:00.103 --> 00:34:02.561
- Fucking Breuil.
- What did you say?


503
00:34:03.436 --> 00:34:06.645
<i>The French economy has created
over 100,000 jobs. Good news.</i>


504
00:34:13.395 --> 00:34:16.645
- Where are you going?
- To the incinerator. The dumpster's full.


505
00:34:16.728 --> 00:34:17.561
Sit down.

506
00:34:18.895 --> 00:34:19.728
Why?

507
00:34:19.811 --> 00:34:22.978
You're the assistant, Sauveur.
The trash is for the warehouse workers.


508
00:34:26.436 --> 00:34:29.145
I'm not gonna wait for a bedsore
from sitting on my ass.


509
00:34:29.228 --> 00:34:32.853
- I don't mind helping out a bit.
- Well, I do mind.


510
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.020
- Do you know about collective agreements?
- Yeah.


511
00:34:36.103 --> 00:34:39.603
It's not just your right
to sit on your ass. It's your duty.


512
00:34:42.228 --> 00:34:46.478
You know how many guys
have seen the wrong end of a cop's baton


513
00:34:46.561 --> 00:34:47.645
just for your ass?

514
00:34:49.561 --> 00:34:51.561
Don't mess things up for us, okay?

515
00:34:55.395 --> 00:34:56.395
Sit down!

516
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.186
<i>...there's also an issue
with a fear of recruiting...</i>


517
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.395
I left my life behind
to go to Paris for training


518
00:35:34.478 --> 00:35:35.686
because you asked me to.

519
00:35:36.478 --> 00:35:39.561
You bring me back, then give
the job you promised me to a moron.


520
00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:41.478
Stéphane isn't a moron.

521
00:35:42.228 --> 00:35:43.520
He has qualifications.

522
00:35:43.603 --> 00:35:45.936
Five years at private-sales.com.

523
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.936
Working with him is a way
for you to increase your skill set.


524
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.603
- Increase my skill set?
- Virginie.


525
00:35:51.853 --> 00:35:53.895
It's a management decision.

526
00:35:53.978 --> 00:35:55.770
You want to talk about management?

527
00:35:57.145 --> 00:36:00.478
I'm going to ask you a question
that I was given during the training.


528
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:03.186
Focus.

529
00:36:04.811 --> 00:36:06.811
In your company, who do you fire first?

530
00:36:07.728 --> 00:36:10.561
The smart person who works hard,
the smart person who doesn't,


531
00:36:10.645 --> 00:36:12.936
the idiot who works hard,
or the idiot who doesn't?


532
00:36:17.853 --> 00:36:20.936
It's the idiot who works hard.
He does the most damage.


533
00:36:22.228 --> 00:36:25.561
Now, imagine that in this company,

534
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:29.353
the idiot's the person with all the power.

535
00:36:36.186 --> 00:36:38.311
Are we talking about Stéphane?

536
00:36:51.145 --> 00:36:52.686
Sauveur, where are you going?

537
00:36:54.561 --> 00:36:55.978
Fuck, how do they do it?

538
00:37:05.436 --> 00:37:07.520
TONIGHT?

539
00:37:16.478 --> 00:37:20.020
PACKAGING AWARDS
BREUIL & SONS


540
00:38:12.478 --> 00:38:13.811
That's her, with Gégé.

541
00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:17.353
Your sweetheart is drunk as a skunk.

542
00:38:17.436 --> 00:38:19.270
Don't say that when you come over.

543
00:38:20.728 --> 00:38:22.728
Okay, you got it? 
You got the champagne?

544
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520
I'm heading over.

545
00:38:28.603 --> 00:38:29.520
Good evening.

546
00:38:32.103 --> 00:38:32.936
Evening.

547
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.270
You couldn't resist.

548
00:38:42.728 --> 00:38:43.686
Coming here.

549
00:38:46.145 --> 00:38:46.978
How are you?

550
00:38:48.853 --> 00:38:49.686
I'm great.

551
00:38:50.186 --> 00:38:52.186
He appointed a business school graduate.

552
00:38:52.853 --> 00:38:54.936
A business school graduate?

553
00:38:55.478 --> 00:39:00.353
I didn't see it coming. I'm so dumb.
Even though I did everything right.


554
00:39:00.436 --> 00:39:04.936
I believe people when they make promises,
but people don't care about promises.


555
00:39:05.436 --> 00:39:07.686
And then you're the fool. Like me.

556
00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.686
I don't really understand. It's confusing.
What's your point? I don't get it.


557
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:18.728
I told you Breuil made me come back
for the role of general manager.


558
00:39:18.811 --> 00:39:20.520
- Yes, right.
- There you go.


559
00:39:20.603 --> 00:39:24.603
Well, Breuil decided to give
the general manager role to someone else.


560
00:39:25.145 --> 00:39:27.478
Right. Because what's Breuil?
He's an asshole.


561
00:39:27.561 --> 00:39:29.311
The Breuils are bastards.

562
00:39:29.395 --> 00:39:32.270
- No, okay.
- I'm really...


563
00:39:32.353 --> 00:39:34.270
Please, let's talk outside.

564
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:39.686
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.561
That wasn't exactly a great first date.

566
00:39:43.228 --> 00:39:44.103
Second.

567
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.686
The first wasn't a raging success either.

568
00:39:56.686 --> 00:39:57.520
What?

569
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.520
Wanna get your revenge on the Breuils?

570
00:40:01.311 --> 00:40:02.520
I wouldn't know how.

571
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.353
But if you could?

572
00:40:06.145 --> 00:40:07.145
Honestly?

573
00:40:08.353 --> 00:40:09.228
Yes.

574
00:40:13.478 --> 00:40:14.478
Can I kiss you?

575
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:17.186
What's the connection?

576
00:40:18.936 --> 00:40:24.561
The connection is
that I'm about to take a big risk for you.


577
00:40:25.936 --> 00:40:27.353
<i>I told her everything.</i>

578
00:40:27.436 --> 00:40:29.686
<i>Don't ask me why. 
I just knew I had to.</i>

579
00:40:30.811 --> 00:40:32.186
<i>A champion's instinct.</i>

580
00:40:35.186 --> 00:40:36.395
Wait, just...

581
00:40:36.478 --> 00:40:38.395
Those barcode readers that scan the boxes?

582
00:40:38.478 --> 00:40:41.395
How do they scan
the bottles that are inside them?


583
00:40:41.478 --> 00:40:42.895
The robots scan the container.

584
00:40:42.978 --> 00:40:44.853
<i>- What's the container?
- Well, the boxes.</i>


585
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.061
<i>They don't count the bottles? 
That's dumb.</i>

586
00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:50.978
<i>It's dumb, but it's fast.
That's all Breuil cares about.</i>


587
00:40:58.186 --> 00:40:59.895
This is a pallet of 27 boxes.

588
00:40:59.978 --> 00:41:00.811
Listen.

589
00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:03.811
When we prepare an order,
we take a whole box<i>,</i>


590
00:41:03.895 --> 00:41:07.020
or we pick stuff out of a box
at the top of the pallet.


591
00:41:07.603 --> 00:41:11.395
Since we only scan the box,
the system tolerates a margin of error.


592
00:41:11.478 --> 00:41:13.645
It doesn't know
how many bottles there are.


593
00:41:13.728 --> 00:41:16.936
That margin of error is 1,1%

594
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.770
There. Listen to this. It's genius.

595
00:41:18.853 --> 00:41:22.728
If we take less
than 1,1% of the entire stock,


596
00:41:23.228 --> 00:41:26.145
the system won't register an error
and won't set off a warning.


597
00:41:26.228 --> 00:41:30.978
And 1,1% equals millions,
just waiting for us to take.


598
00:41:31.061 --> 00:41:33.770
2,5 million, to be precise,
which is 50,000 bottles.


599
00:41:33.853 --> 00:41:36.561
- We can't take 50,000 bottles.
- Why not?


600
00:41:37.395 --> 00:41:41.228
50,000 bottles. 
That's actual theft, son.

601
00:41:41.311 --> 00:41:43.853
50,000 bottles is nothing to Breuil.

602
00:41:43.936 --> 00:41:46.353
We won't get caught. 
Give me the notepad.

603
00:41:50.645 --> 00:41:52.895
We just need to find ten people.
Build a team.


604
00:41:52.978 --> 00:41:56.270
Ten people? How?
I'm your only friend in the place.


605
00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.603
To bring people into this,
you need to know them a bit.


606
00:42:00.686 --> 00:42:03.895
Scania, Virginie's job is
to recruit people.


607
00:42:03.978 --> 00:42:06.811
It's not her job to recruit people
to steal from their boss.


608
00:42:06.895 --> 00:42:09.436
Would lots of people refuse
an extra month's salary


609
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.103
handed to them on a platter?

610
00:42:12.186 --> 00:42:13.686
An extra salary every month.

611
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:18.228
Remember that our dream
was always to make the Breuils pay.


612
00:42:18.311 --> 00:42:20.895
With this, they'll lose 2,5 million euros.

613
00:42:20.978 --> 00:42:24.978
It'd be criminal not to take them
for every last cent.


614
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.103
Okay, maybe.

615
00:42:32.395 --> 00:42:34.228
We need to convince ten people.

616
00:42:39.103 --> 00:42:41.145
- Okay, that's good.
- Yeah.


617
00:42:41.228 --> 00:42:43.603
They're good. We can trust them.

618
00:42:44.186 --> 00:42:46.978
We're not taking him.
We're not taking Lablonde.


619
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:48.395
There's no way.

620
00:42:48.478 --> 00:42:49.561
We have to take him.

621
00:42:49.645 --> 00:42:51.270
<i>Virginie taught me something.</i>

622
00:42:51.353 --> 00:42:55.228
<i>Out of the 26 million workers in France,

623
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:56.853
<i>That's nothing, right?</i>

624
00:42:56.936 --> 00:42:58.811
<i>No one has ever heard of Buddhists.</i>

625
00:42:58.895 --> 00:43:01.686
<i>Well, actually,
there are twice as many of them</i>


626
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.895
<i>as the 400,000 union workers
who bust our balls all year round,</i>


627
00:43:04.978 --> 00:43:07.228
<i>which tells you
what a nuisance they could be.</i>


628
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:11.395
<i>If the Breuil union had the bad idea
of hitting us with a week-long strike,</i>


629
00:43:11.478 --> 00:43:14.436
<i>we'd get nothing out
and lose even more dough than Breuil.</i>


630
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.353
<i>She was right. We needed Lablonde.
He was the union rep at the company.</i>


631
00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:29.936
<i>Like they say in Japan,
"Rain falls harder on a leaky roof."</i>


632
00:43:30.603 --> 00:43:33.186
<i>So my business had to run like clockwork.</i>

633
00:43:35.478 --> 00:43:39.103
<i>I found that the trick was
to slip a duplicate of a big order</i>


634
00:43:39.186 --> 00:43:41.061
<i>into the pile of orders to be prepared.</i>

635
00:43:41.145 --> 00:43:42.061
<i>That one there.</i>

636
00:43:42.645 --> 00:43:46.395
<i>If we were caught, it could be blamed
on a small printing error.</i>


637
00:43:46.478 --> 00:43:47.728
<i>Could happen to anyone.</i>

638
00:43:48.395 --> 00:43:49.686
Mr. Lablonde!

639
00:43:54.853 --> 00:43:58.895
<i>We had to have guys at every step
of the pallet being processed.</i>


640
00:43:58.978 --> 00:44:02.353
<i>First, Lablonde decides
which team prepares what order.</i>


641
00:44:05.311 --> 00:44:08.186
<i>That's Annie Boss, supervisor.</i>

642
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:11.270
<i>She makes sure
the list gets into the right hands.</i>


643
00:44:14.811 --> 00:44:17.936
<i>Franck Schumi,
the Schumacher of forklift drivers.</i>


644
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.353
<i>I timed each of them ten times.
He's the fastest.</i>


645
00:44:22.561 --> 00:44:24.603
<i>He's in charge of
lowering the top pallets,</i>


646
00:44:24.686 --> 00:44:26.020
<i>the ones we never dip into.</i>

647
00:44:26.103 --> 00:44:28.603
There. You see
how everything is automated.


648
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.478
With our friends.

649
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.103
<i>The Seko twins.</i>

650
00:44:39.686 --> 00:44:42.853
<i>Fabrice and Fabien.
Known for their flexibility.</i>


651
00:44:42.936 --> 00:44:46.561
<i>Their job is to take stuff
from the bottom of the pallet</i>


652
00:44:46.645 --> 00:44:48.728
<i>to delay, for as long as possible,</i>

653
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:51.270
<i>the discovery that products
are missing from the stock.</i>


654
00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.270
<i>It's very easy
for the surveillance team to notice</i>


655
00:45:02.353 --> 00:45:05.436
<i>if two identical big orders
are being prepared at the same time.</i>


656
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.645
<i>It never happens,
so that'd sound the alarm.</i>


657
00:45:07.728 --> 00:45:09.645
<i>It's difficult to buy the security guards.</i>

658
00:45:09.728 --> 00:45:11.645
<i>A private company changes them each week.</i>

659
00:45:11.728 --> 00:45:13.936
<i>But watch Yasmina and Déborah.</i>

660
00:45:15.186 --> 00:45:19.436
<i>Yasmina goes down the list of products
from A to Z.</i>


661
00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.103
<i>Déborah goes up the
list from Z to A.</i>

662
00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:23.895
<i>The guys on video don't get it.</i>

663
00:45:24.478 --> 00:45:26.895
<i>Me neither. 
That must mean it's working.</i>

664
00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:34.895
<i>See the A4 sheet that Mickaël is slipping
between two boxes there?</i>


665
00:45:34.978 --> 00:45:38.520
<i>Truckers and dockers aren't allowed
inside the warehouse.</i>


666
00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:39.645
<i>We use that sign</i>

667
00:45:39.728 --> 00:45:42.728
<i>to follow the pallet
that needs to be diverted after the gate.</i>


668
00:45:42.811 --> 00:45:44.020
Okay, let's watch.

669
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.353
Watch.

670
00:45:46.186 --> 00:45:47.728
It's going to turn now. There.

671
00:45:54.561 --> 00:45:55.853
- All done.
- There you go.


672
00:45:56.353 --> 00:46:02.311
<i>There it is. 27 boxes of 72 bottles.
I'll let you do the math.</i>


673
00:46:04.603 --> 00:46:06.395
<i>- Lablonde validates the dispatch.</i>
- Okay.


674
00:46:06.478 --> 00:46:10.020
<i>Mourad, our docker,
just has to divert it to the right truck.</i>


675
00:46:10.103 --> 00:46:11.228
I'll take that one in.

676
00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:13.561
<i>And our driver,</i>

677
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:16.020
<i>you already know him.</i>

678
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.936
<i>If you're no math wizard,</i>

679
00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.603
<i>we lifted two pallets
of 1,944 bottles a week.</i>


680
00:46:27.228 --> 00:46:31.686
<i>On the market,
that's 388,000 in cash every month.</i>


681
00:46:35.061 --> 00:46:36.645
Wanna come by tonight?

682
00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:39.728
I'm not good at meeting people.

683
00:46:40.853 --> 00:46:42.936
Isn't that the essence of your job?

684
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.770
It's not the same thing.

685
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:48.478
What? You can't handle it?

686
00:46:48.978 --> 00:46:51.103
- Don't push, Sauveur.
- What?


687
00:46:51.186 --> 00:46:53.353
I'm in as deep as you are.
I'm just cautious.


688
00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:56.645
- We don't know where all this will lead.
- We do.


689
00:46:56.728 --> 00:46:58.936
We're going to rip two million
off Breuil Jr.


690
00:46:59.728 --> 00:47:01.520
I'm not talking about that. After.

691
00:47:03.145 --> 00:47:04.228
After...

692
00:47:05.895 --> 00:47:10.811
After that, we'll take our money.
We'll leave this town, and we'll see.


693
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.603
You know nothing about me.

694
00:47:16.936 --> 00:47:18.228
I know enough.

695
00:47:20.895 --> 00:47:23.520
You think I'd leave it all behind
for a warehouse worker?


696
00:47:25.228 --> 00:47:26.103
Yes.

697
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.353
No?

698
00:47:34.311 --> 00:47:35.145
Yes.

699
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:42.186
Okay.

700
00:47:43.436 --> 00:47:44.686
They'll be waiting for me.

701
00:48:00.103 --> 00:48:03.603
<i>If by chance you want
to set up a business like mine,</i>


702
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:05.686
<i>just a word of advice.</i>

703
00:48:06.436 --> 00:48:07.770
<i>Take space into account.</i>

704
00:48:08.978 --> 00:48:13.186
<i>I can guarantee that two pallets per week
take up a whole lot of space.</i>


705
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:18.145
<i>And one last thing.
Make sure to keep an eye on your team.</i>


706
00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:23.020
<i>Don't forget. The worst rich person
is the one who used to be poor.</i>


707
00:48:23.895 --> 00:48:27.770
<i>From the first payday, every team member
opened the bullshit floodgates.</i>


708
00:48:28.353 --> 00:48:29.936
<i>And I mean big-time.</i>

709
00:48:30.645 --> 00:48:34.811
<i>Schumi wanted to have cooking lessons

710
00:48:34.895 --> 00:48:35.853

Hello?

We do what we can, Daniel.

750
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:04.395
But you're pushing too much.
We can't take it.


751
00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:06.728
Tuesday, Moulins. Wednesday, Mâcon.

752
00:51:06.811 --> 00:51:10.186
Thursday, Montbéliard.
Friday, Montargis. Saturday, Montviers.

What do we do, bro?

754
00:51:12.311 --> 00:51:15.520
You've done the towns starting with M.
Do the cities starting with N!


755
00:51:16.603 --> 00:51:20.270
<i>We were reaching our limit.
But that didn't bother anyone.</i>

<i>There was only one thing on my mind.

<i>Jesus.</i>

<i>The magical child.</i>

<i>Jesus was Yasmina's half brother,

762
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:44.436
<i>During his adventures,</i>

763
00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.936
<i>he'd made friends with
two directors of the Bergamini store,</i>


764
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.395
<i>the Italian Sephora
that just came to France.</i>


765
00:51:50.478 --> 00:51:51.978
...in cash, every month.

766
00:51:52.061 --> 00:51:55.228
<i>He even talked them into
doing business with me.</i>


767
00:51:56.103 --> 00:51:57.811
<i>So we had to have structure.</i>

768
00:51:58.478 --> 00:52:01.311
<i>The first problem I had was storage.</i>

769
00:52:01.395 --> 00:52:03.645
<i>Whenever I have a problem,
Scania has a cousin.</i>


770
00:52:03.728 --> 00:52:04.686
- How are you?
- Hi.


771
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:06.853
<i>He was a dairy farmer
and broke as they come.</i>


772
00:52:06.936 --> 00:52:07.770
You good?

773
00:52:07.853 --> 00:52:10.811
<i>He'd had enough
of eating what he could hunt,</i>


774
00:52:10.895 --> 00:52:13.228
<i>so he jumped at the chance
to rent out his barn.</i>


775
00:52:13.311 --> 00:52:14.311
- So?
- Perfect.


776
00:52:14.395 --> 00:52:17.645
<i>Other than Scania and I,
no one knew where the stock was.</i>


777
00:52:17.728 --> 00:52:18.770
<i>It was better that way.</i>

778
00:52:18.853 --> 00:52:23.395
<i>All we needed was our own truck to deliver
to Bergamini, so I broke my piggy bank.</i>


779
00:52:23.478 --> 00:52:25.103
It's the least expensive one. Come.

780
00:52:25.645 --> 00:52:26.520
Shut up!

781
00:52:26.603 --> 00:52:31.895
<i>With my small company, I sold all my stock
to Bergamini like any other local company.</i>


782
00:52:31.978 --> 00:52:33.853
<i>I sold them 20% cheaper than Breuil.</i>

783
00:52:34.853 --> 00:52:38.561
<i>Apparently, Tapie said,
"The first million is the hardest."</i>


784
00:52:38.645 --> 00:52:40.686
<i>Well, I can tell you, not for us.</i>

785
00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.895
Drink!

786
00:52:51.645 --> 00:52:56.561
<i>The real France of tax-free overtime.
That was us.</i>


787
00:52:56.645 --> 00:52:59.520
<i>I mean, who would want
something like that to end?</i>


788
00:53:02.436 --> 00:53:03.311
Béa?

789
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:05.895
Béa.

790
00:53:07.353 --> 00:53:08.270
What?

791
00:53:12.645 --> 00:53:15.270
- We have a huge problem.
- What's wrong?


792
00:53:18.561 --> 00:53:21.520
After signing the agreement
in principle with Nougarolis...


793
00:53:23.853 --> 00:53:25.270
<i>I called you, remember?</i>

794
00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:27.645
- It's me.
- <i>So?</i>


795
00:53:29.186 --> 00:53:30.186
They just left.

796
00:53:31.145 --> 00:53:32.811
Is it fully signed?

797
00:53:32.895 --> 00:53:34.270
<i>Just a few formalities.</i>

798
00:53:34.353 --> 00:53:36.728
Accounts audit,
stock inventory by his auditors.


799
00:53:37.645 --> 00:53:40.186
The sale will be complete
in a month's time.


800
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.811
And? It was all going well.
What happened after that?


801
00:53:44.395 --> 00:53:47.603
<i>Once I had left, I heard a loud noise
from the warehouse.</i>


802
00:53:48.353 --> 00:53:49.228
<i>What noise?</i>

803
00:53:49.311 --> 00:53:52.770
<i>We had a metal sheet
come off the roof a few months back.</i>


804
00:53:52.853 --> 00:53:54.936
<i>Yes, you mentioned there were leaks.</i>

805
00:53:56.061 --> 00:53:59.103
<i>Leaks in the warehouse.</i>

806
00:53:59.186 --> 00:54:03.770
So with all that water,
he wanted to go take a look.


807
00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:10.895
<i>And he found them.</i>

808
00:54:17.853 --> 00:54:21.061
<i>He opened 20 boxes at random.</i>

809
00:54:22.228 --> 00:54:23.061
<i>All empty.</i>

810
00:54:23.145 --> 00:54:25.603
Why didn't you call the cops right away?

811
00:54:25.686 --> 00:54:30.311
Well, Béa, because I'd just signed
a binding agreement with Nougarolis.


812
00:54:31.186 --> 00:54:34.520
If he hears about all this
before I find the missing stock,


813
00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.186
<i>we're fucked.</i>

814
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:37.520
You know what that means?

815
00:54:39.603 --> 00:54:43.770
<i>After the stock inventory,
I'll be able to buy Breuil at half price.</i>


816
00:54:44.353 --> 00:54:47.770
Empty shelves sell at a lot less
than full shelves, even if it's perfume.


817
00:54:49.936 --> 00:54:51.020
What do you think?

818
00:54:51.728 --> 00:54:55.603
I get myself a job at Breuil
as an ex-con reentering the job market.


819
00:54:56.103 --> 00:55:00.103
That always attracts the thugs.
I identify the thieves. I infiltrate them.


820
00:55:00.603 --> 00:55:02.645
I report back on the missing stock.

821
00:55:03.145 --> 00:55:04.436
Nothing complicated.

822
00:55:05.228 --> 00:55:06.103
Great.

823
00:55:07.645 --> 00:55:10.061
You won't reveal your source?
It's your business.


824
00:55:10.561 --> 00:55:14.145
But did they give you any details
that might have drawn your attention?


825
00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:17.061
Bearing in mind your deadline,
it could save us time.


826
00:55:17.561 --> 00:55:19.686
<i>There is something,
now that I think about it.</i>


827
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.061
<i>Two, three weeks ago,
Patrick came home all upset</i>


828
00:55:22.145 --> 00:55:24.811
<i>because an employee took his spot
in the parking lot.</i>


829
00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.186
<i>It wasn't the poor guy's fault.</i>

830
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.561
<i>I took down the "Reserved for
Armand Breuil" sign when he died.</i>


831
00:55:31.645 --> 00:55:33.603
- Two minutes. I'll get him.
- Well...


832
00:55:34.478 --> 00:55:37.603
"Two minutes..." You mean, one minute.

833
00:55:38.895 --> 00:55:42.936
<i>The odd thing is that it was a young
warehouse worker with a luxury car.</i>


834
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:44.936
<i>An Audi TT, I think.</i>

835
00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.103
Sorry, boss.
There's no sign, so I thought...


836
00:55:48.603 --> 00:55:51.145
- I didn't want it to get scratched.
- Yes.


837
00:55:52.061 --> 00:55:52.978
<i>An Audi TT.</i>

838
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:55.061
<i>That's more than enough.</i>

839
00:55:55.978 --> 00:55:59.478
On the face of it, we should
get this done in under a week.


840
00:56:00.228 --> 00:56:02.145
That's what I wanted to hear.

841
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:06.311
From now on, call me Ange.

842
00:56:34.645 --> 00:56:36.270
- You good? Yeah.
- All right?


843
00:56:37.895 --> 00:56:41.270
- What are you eating?
- Where have you been, looking like a mess?


844
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.020
Daniel's been looking for you.

845
00:56:45.103 --> 00:56:46.645
Are you listening to me?

846
00:56:48.395 --> 00:56:51.395
You can't just show up here
at lunchtime every day.


847
00:56:52.228 --> 00:56:54.728
Daniel's going to replace you.
You hear, Yoni?


848
00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:56.978
Screw Daniel.

849
00:56:57.561 --> 00:56:58.395
Yeah?

850
00:57:00.436 --> 00:57:03.103
Hey. You're screwing all of us.

851
00:57:04.353 --> 00:57:06.561
Because of you,
we couldn't get it out today.


852
00:57:08.395 --> 00:57:12.353
We'll only get half our money on Friday.
What's your excuse?


853
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.353
I'm in love.

854
00:57:17.603 --> 00:57:20.436
- I'm going, or I'll punch him.
- It's no big deal.


855
00:57:21.645 --> 00:57:22.770
You dumb or what?

856
00:57:22.853 --> 00:57:25.228
What's your dad's problem?
He gets on my nerves.


857
00:57:26.061 --> 00:57:28.270
- Did you hear what you said to him?
- It's 8:00 a.m.


858
00:57:28.353 --> 00:57:29.811
"8:00 a.m."? It's noon.

859
00:57:30.645 --> 00:57:32.061
Have the clocks changed?

860
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:35.436
- Who's the girl?
- The girl from the checkroom.


861
00:57:36.061 --> 00:57:37.270
- At Pharaoh's?
- Yeah.


862
00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:40.686
- Isn't that the bouncer's girl?
- Not between 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.


863
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:43.686
- He's going to destroy you.
- I can handle myself.


864
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:44.936
I'd like to see that.

865
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.895
- She's hot though.
- Don't talk about my girl. It's serious.


866
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.728
- You bastard!
- Bruce!


867
00:58:02.811 --> 00:58:04.020
- It wasn't me!
- Leave him!


868
00:58:04.103 --> 00:58:06.728
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Bruce, let him go!


869
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:08.895
You piece of shit! Asshole!

870
00:58:08.978 --> 00:58:11.186
- Don't kill me!
- Stop!


871
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:13.228
- Hey! Let me go!
- Stop!


872
00:58:13.311 --> 00:58:17.686
- Stop! I'm begging you! Bruce!
- Let me go, asshole!


873
00:58:20.728 --> 00:58:23.270
Fuck. What is that ex-con doing there?

874
00:58:24.353 --> 00:58:26.478
Hey!

875
00:58:26.561 --> 00:58:27.478
What are you doing?

876
00:58:28.103 --> 00:58:30.103
I don't know, boss. 
I was told to fill...

877
00:58:30.186 --> 00:58:32.228
You weren't told anything.
Go see Lablonde.


878
00:58:32.311 --> 00:58:34.103
He'll move you. 
Get this done.

879
00:58:35.145 --> 00:58:37.770
What's with your cousin?
He's ditched me twice this week.


880
00:58:37.853 --> 00:58:39.978
It's serious this time.
He's in the hospital.


881
00:58:40.645 --> 00:58:43.270
- Two months on disability.
- No way. What did you do?


882
00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:46.770
We went out to the Pharaoh.
He got beaten up by some guy.


883
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.436
You messing with me?
Do you know what's at stake?


884
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.603
- I know. I'm sorry, but...
- Shut up.


885
00:58:52.686 --> 00:58:56.520
We have a pallet to get out.
How are you going to manage on your own?


886
00:58:58.436 --> 00:59:00.478
- I don't know.
- Yeah, well...


887
00:59:00.561 --> 00:59:02.478
Tell Yoni to stay tucked in bed.

888
00:59:02.561 --> 00:59:04.728
- He's fired. You tell him.
- Daniel...


889
00:59:08.436 --> 00:59:11.103
Excuse me. Can I talk
to you for a second?

890
00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:14.770
Tell me. What were you in prison for?

891
00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.270
- Armored vehicle.
- Armored vehicle?


892
00:59:21.895 --> 00:59:23.520
Okay. Were you armed?

893
00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:27.770
- It's easier than using bare hands.
- Right.


894
00:59:28.811 --> 00:59:29.770
Did you shoot?

895
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:33.061
AK47, it's enough to just show it.

896
00:59:34.895 --> 00:59:37.228
And how many years did you get?

897
00:59:40.603 --> 00:59:42.811
Eight. Four on probation.

898
00:59:43.353 --> 00:59:44.436
You snitched?

899
00:59:47.895 --> 00:59:48.895
Good behavior.

900
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.645
Would you like to make
an easy 500 smackers?


901
00:59:56.186 --> 01:00:00.311
- Forget it. I'm not interested.
- I mean it. No risk. It's really clean.


902
01:00:00.395 --> 01:00:02.978
You'll have your 500 smackers
at 2:00 p.m. It's fine.


903
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.436
You interested?

904
01:00:09.853 --> 01:00:13.270
Go see Mickaël over there,
next to the wrapper. He'll explain.


905
01:00:18.103 --> 01:00:19.561
<i>That's what you came up with?</i>

906
01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:22.728
- To hire an ex-con.
- You could've discussed it with us.


907
01:00:22.811 --> 01:00:26.520
As long as he does the job, I'm fine.
Is he doing the job, Mickaël?


908
01:00:27.228 --> 01:00:28.270
He's doing good.

909
01:00:28.353 --> 01:00:31.811
Fine, but what if he tries
to look good and tells his PO?


910
01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:33.311
- His what?
- His PO.


911
01:00:33.395 --> 01:00:36.186
Probation officer. 
What if he turns us in?

912
01:00:36.895 --> 01:00:40.395
Actually, he's involved now.
He has more to lose than we do.


913
01:00:40.895 --> 01:00:43.311
If there's an issue,
he'll get sent back to jail.


914
01:00:43.395 --> 01:00:44.228
No risk for us.

915
01:00:44.311 --> 01:00:48.103
That's all nice,
but how are you going to pay him?


916
01:00:48.686 --> 01:00:51.020
He's getting Yoni's share.
After that, we'll see.


917
01:00:51.603 --> 01:00:52.645
That's not right.

918
01:00:52.728 --> 01:00:55.311
Not right?
Weren't you in charge of your nephew?


919
01:00:55.395 --> 01:00:58.895
Hold on. You're paying him as much as us?
Seniority doesn't count?


920
01:00:58.978 --> 01:01:02.978
You're constantly plugged into the news.
It's frying your brain.


921
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.020
Is this the negotiating table
at an industrial relations meeting?


922
01:01:08.103 --> 01:01:11.353
Listen. That ex-con is a risk
that involves all of us.


923
01:01:11.436 --> 01:01:12.436
- True.
- Right.


924
01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.853
I say we take a vote. 
I vote against.

925
01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:17.645
- Same.
- There's been a misunderstanding. No vote.


926
01:01:18.145 --> 01:01:21.561
Okay? So you schedule him with Mickaël,
and that's it.


927
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:25.270
Save your saliva for your wife.

928
01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:33.103
What I'm about to tell you
is extremely serious.


929
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.770
I found out we're being robbed.

930
01:01:44.478 --> 01:01:46.728
- Here?
- Products. A lot of them.


931
01:01:48.978 --> 01:01:50.853
It's probably happening as we speak.

932
01:01:51.478 --> 01:01:54.770
No way. We have
the best security system in the valley.


933
01:01:54.853 --> 01:01:56.228
There's no doubt about it.

934
01:01:57.436 --> 01:01:59.478
It has to be one of our employees.

935
01:02:01.228 --> 01:02:02.895
No one knows them better than you.

936
01:02:06.228 --> 01:02:10.186
I want you to analyze the HR database
to look for suspect profiles.


937
01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:13.145
- Even old employees.
- Of course.


938
01:02:13.936 --> 01:02:16.936
I promise
that if we get through this together,


939
01:02:17.478 --> 01:02:19.895
this time, I won't forget you.

940
01:02:22.936 --> 01:02:25.270
- In a nutshell?
- He knows everything.


941
01:02:25.353 --> 01:02:28.228
No. He asked you to find out.
That's not the same at all.


942
01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.395
Semantics. He won't let it go.

943
01:02:30.478 --> 01:02:32.145
Breuil Jr. won't let anything go?

944
01:02:32.645 --> 01:02:34.645
You're laughing, but I see him every day.

945
01:02:34.728 --> 01:02:36.603
- Yeah.
- So, what do I tell him?


946
01:02:37.228 --> 01:02:38.770
You know it can't be traced.

947
01:02:38.853 --> 01:02:42.186
Every pallet we take
goes through the normal workflow.


948
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.561
So, if at any point there's an error,

949
01:02:44.645 --> 01:02:47.561
it's an order that was duplicated,
and that's all.


950
01:02:47.645 --> 01:02:50.686
An error. You just need to rationalize it.

951
01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:52.228
- Rationalize?
- Yeah.


952
01:02:52.311 --> 01:02:55.603
But we're in deep shit with Breuil!
Do you get that?


953
01:02:55.686 --> 01:02:57.436
Aren't you being overdramatic?

954
01:02:57.978 --> 01:03:01.020
It's a matter of time
before he finds out everything.


955
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.978
We're lucky enough to have a heads-up.
Shouldn't we cool things down?


956
01:03:06.686 --> 01:03:07.520
Not yet.

957
01:03:41.311 --> 01:03:44.603
What I found out last night is big.
Very big.


958
01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:46.853
Give me names and addresses.

959
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.478
I've got a good lead, but I need more time
before I can give you a full report.


960
01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.645
Didn't we say under a week?

961
01:03:54.395 --> 01:03:56.020
I haven't found the stock yet.

962
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.686
I'm not saying we won't,
but this isn't a small team.


963
01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:02.895
That's your problem.
Mine is to get my money's worth.


964
01:04:02.978 --> 01:04:07.770
Mr. Nougarolis, I don't earn my living
with my fees, but with the bonus I get.


965
01:04:07.853 --> 01:04:11.728
The tally is at 5,000 a week.
That bonus thing isn't funny.


966
01:04:11.811 --> 01:04:13.478
If you prefer, we
can call it a day.

967
01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.770
You wanna play it like that? With me?

968
01:04:19.395 --> 01:04:21.520
You're not very smart for a sleuth.

969
01:04:22.811 --> 01:04:26.228
You tell me people are stealing?
That the audit will confirm it?


970
01:04:26.311 --> 01:04:30.020
That's enough for me to make Breuil bleed.
I don't need your shitty report.


971
01:04:30.686 --> 01:04:33.603
You know what we're going to do?
Let's call it a day.


972
01:04:34.561 --> 01:04:37.478
I'll work things out with my contact.
We're done.


973
01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.353
That's how it is?

974
01:04:40.853 --> 01:04:41.978
Yes, that's how it is.

975
01:04:52.436 --> 01:04:53.561
I'm not following.

976
01:04:53.645 --> 01:04:57.228
You wanted to move fast. Now you want
to put the sale off for six months?


977
01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:01.395
You're going to shed staff when
you merge Breuil & Sons with Nougarolis.


978
01:05:01.895 --> 01:05:04.145
These people have worked for us forever.

979
01:05:04.645 --> 01:05:07.186
I'd like to find new jobs
for as many people as possible.


980
01:05:07.895 --> 01:05:09.520
One less job for you.

981
01:05:10.186 --> 01:05:12.061
Redundancy schemes are always a drag.

982
01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:15.853
You know that one?

983
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.603
Who would you fire first?

984
01:05:19.645 --> 01:05:22.353
- The smart guy who works...
- The idiot who works hard.


985
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.811
I need six months.

986
01:05:44.811 --> 01:05:45.728
Espresso?

987
01:06:02.103 --> 01:06:06.228
You know, since I was a kid,
I've picked up on people's energy.


988
01:06:06.728 --> 01:06:10.061
It's a kind of
gift that I was given.

989
01:06:11.395 --> 01:06:14.353
I see a lot of suffering in you.
Too much emotion.


990
01:06:15.395 --> 01:06:18.728
You need to free yourself
from that as soon as possible.


991
01:06:20.686 --> 01:06:22.311
So we're not changing the deal.

992
01:06:24.103 --> 01:06:27.520
KP2M will come take a stock inventory
by the end of the month,


993
01:06:27.603 --> 01:06:30.270
and we will close the sale as agreed.

994
01:06:33.811 --> 01:06:36.686
Breuil's freaking out.
He's increasing security.


995
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:38.270
It's all you ever talk about.

996
01:06:38.353 --> 01:06:41.478
Of course. There are ten security guards
arriving next week.


997
01:06:41.561 --> 01:06:43.270
We'll adapt. What's the big deal?

998
01:06:43.353 --> 01:06:46.311
Are you dumb?
Breuil knows how much was stolen.


999
01:06:46.395 --> 01:06:48.811
If there's one snitch,
you'll all go to prison.


1000
01:06:49.311 --> 01:06:50.436
Did you say "you"?

1001
01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.311
- What do you mean?
- Why didn't you say "we"?


1002
01:06:54.728 --> 01:06:57.103
- You made a deal with Breuil?
- Stop right there.


1003
01:06:59.061 --> 01:07:00.145
You should tell them.

1004
01:07:00.228 --> 01:07:03.561
They'll freak out over nothing.
Leave them out of my business.


1005
01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:04.895
- Your business?
- Yeah.


1006
01:07:04.978 --> 01:07:06.686
You're not doing business, Daniel.

1007
01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:09.353
You're a small-time thief
that steals a lot.


1008
01:07:09.436 --> 01:07:12.395
I'm not going back to being
a pallet-pusher for Breuil.


1009
01:07:12.478 --> 01:07:14.686
It's my way out.
Maybe it's a bit fun for you...


1010
01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:17.686
"Fun"? You have no idea
what I've had to do to get here.


1011
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:20.853
For me, it's simple.
It stops here. You should do the same.


1012
01:07:22.353 --> 01:07:26.145
If not for me, you'd still be selling
a few perfumes at the market.


1013
01:07:27.228 --> 01:07:28.270
You need to listen.

1014
01:07:28.353 --> 01:07:31.270
What do I owe you?
Go on, tell me what I owe you.


1015
01:07:37.061 --> 01:07:40.770
You're right. You owe me nothing.
We don't owe each other anything.


1016
01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:47.020
Your letting go says something
about the kind of person you are.


1017
01:07:47.603 --> 01:07:51.770
You're so desperate to fit in that mold,
your business guys have restricted you.


1018
01:07:51.853 --> 01:07:54.311
You've forgotten
what really matters in life.


1019
01:07:55.228 --> 01:07:56.311
What's that? Money?

1020
01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:57.895
No, flair.

1021
01:08:33.228 --> 01:08:34.478
That fucking idiot.

1022
01:08:39.936 --> 01:08:41.270
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Breuil?</i>


1023
01:08:41.853 --> 01:08:43.728
<i>I know who's stealing from you.</i>

1024
01:08:51.645 --> 01:08:52.520
<i>Mr. Breuil?</i>

1025
01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.520
<i>Are you still there?</i>

1026
01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:55.853
Yes.

1027
01:08:56.645 --> 01:08:59.228
<i>Like I said,
I know who's stealing from you.</i>


1028
01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:02.186
<i>I know that you've
had a lot go missing.</i>

1029
01:09:02.686 --> 01:09:06.770
<i>I also know how that could compromise
the sale of your business.</i>


1030
01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:09.186
<i>I can help you.</i>

1031
01:09:10.353 --> 01:09:12.395
<i>- That's my job.</i>
- I need the stock.


1032
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:18.020
I absolutely need to find my stock
and put it back.


1033
01:09:18.103 --> 01:09:18.978
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

1034
01:09:19.478 --> 01:09:23.561
<i>I can get you out of this in good shape
if you're willing to pay the price.</i>


1035
01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:28.145
<i>Pay 50,000 up front
and 50,000 when I deliver the report.</i>


1036
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.853
<i>It's not much compared to what's at stake.</i>

1037
01:09:37.061 --> 01:09:37.895
<i>Mr. Breuil?</i>

1038
01:09:39.061 --> 01:09:39.895
I heard you.

1039
01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.353
<i>It's essential that
you don't talk to anyone about this.</i>


1040
01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:48.311
Who am I going to talk to?

1041
01:09:54.978 --> 01:09:57.395
OPEN THE RECEIVED FILE

1042
01:10:17.061 --> 01:10:18.561
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Breuil.</i>

1043
01:10:20.228 --> 01:10:23.520
<i>Now, listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.</i>


1044
01:10:26.728 --> 01:10:29.353
I'M SORRY, PLEASE CALL ME
VIRGINIE?


1045
01:10:45.228 --> 01:10:46.311
Hello?

1046
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:55.895
Breuil knows.

1047
01:10:55.978 --> 01:10:58.436
- What?
- Is this a joke, Daniel?


1048
01:10:59.395 --> 01:11:01.520
- How is that possible?
- Fuck, no way.


1049
01:11:01.603 --> 01:11:04.353
The good thing is,
he doesn't know it's us.


1050
01:11:05.103 --> 01:11:08.853
But I hope you've set a little aside
because the source has run dry.


1051
01:11:08.936 --> 01:11:09.978
- No.
- No.


1052
01:11:10.645 --> 01:11:16.145
Well, I have a solution for you,
but it means going bigger.


1053
01:11:16.228 --> 01:11:17.270
What does that mean?

1054
01:11:17.353 --> 01:11:18.936
Lablonde, can you confirm

1055
01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:22.145
that we have 38 tons going
to Sephora Paris Rivoli this weekend?


1056
01:11:22.228 --> 01:11:24.145
No, well, I don't know...

1057
01:11:24.228 --> 01:11:26.145
- Yes or no?
- I don't have the calendar!


1058
01:11:26.228 --> 01:11:29.186
Right, okay.
I prepared the orders for Mother's Day.


1059
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:33.436
Two of the trucks are loaded up
to the max. 40,000 units each.


1060
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.853
I suggest we make them disappear.

1061
01:11:37.936 --> 01:11:39.145
What?

1062
01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.436
- What?
- That's real theft.


1063
01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.353
I'm in!

1064
01:11:41.436 --> 01:11:43.978
What if they trace it back to us?

1065
01:11:44.061 --> 01:11:45.270
They won't trace it back

1066
01:11:45.353 --> 01:11:48.270
because they'll think
that the trucks were held up


1067
01:11:48.895 --> 01:11:50.270
by a team of professionals.

1068
01:11:50.353 --> 01:11:52.895
What? Who's going to do that? Because...

1069
01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:53.811
We are.

1070
01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:55.936
- You're mad.
- Hold on.


1071
01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.603
A truck is just a big van, right?

1072
01:11:59.353 --> 01:12:00.478
Your specialty, Ange.

1073
01:12:01.978 --> 01:12:05.645
The 80,000 units will be in storage
before being sold off.


1074
01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:08.436
It's worth 2,5 million.

1075
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:10.811
And we'll split it evenly.

1076
01:12:11.853 --> 01:12:13.353
We have two days to get ready.

1077
01:12:13.436 --> 01:12:14.395
Who's in?

1078
01:12:14.478 --> 01:12:15.895
Now we get a vote?

1079
01:12:15.978 --> 01:12:16.811
Shut up, you.

1080
01:12:17.686 --> 01:12:18.520
Well, 200,000...

1081
01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:25.895
- Get down!
- Don't shoot!


1082
01:12:25.978 --> 01:12:27.853
- I don't want to die!
- Shut up!


1083
01:12:27.936 --> 01:12:29.353
No! Yes, sir.

1084
01:12:29.436 --> 01:12:30.603
No!

1085
01:12:32.061 --> 01:12:34.853
Give me your hands.
I said shut the fuck up!


1086
01:12:34.936 --> 01:12:37.686
- Shut up!
- Stop. Hold it.


1087
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.603
- Never drop your weapon.
- But how do I get the thing on?


1088
01:12:40.686 --> 01:12:42.978
Never put down your weapon or you're dead!

1089
01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.645
Is that clear?

1090
01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:45.686
Can I have a go?

1091
01:12:51.353 --> 01:12:52.186
What? You?

1092
01:12:58.353 --> 01:12:59.228
Really?

1093
01:12:59.311 --> 01:13:01.020
- Face down!
- Are you mad?


1094
01:13:01.103 --> 01:13:03.145
- Hands behind your back. Shut up!
- It hurt!


1095
01:13:03.228 --> 01:13:05.603
- It's a practice run.
- Behind your back! Shut up!


1096
01:13:05.686 --> 01:13:08.353
Asshole. Shut up!

1097
01:13:08.436 --> 01:13:10.228
There. That's how it's done!

1098
01:13:10.311 --> 01:13:13.936
She was holding the zip ties,
and she kept the gun on Mourad.


1099
01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.436
- Okay! Well done.
- Well done, Boss!


1100
01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.895
- Wanna try the truck again?
- No, it's fine.


1101
01:13:22.228 --> 01:13:23.645
Just one thing, guys.

1102
01:13:25.436 --> 01:13:28.936
Don't forget that
the second driver won't be in on it. Okay?


1103
01:13:29.561 --> 01:13:33.311
Same thing for the gas station staff
at Lionville. Okay?


1104
01:13:33.853 --> 01:13:36.770
I want us to be believable.
They'll eventually be witnesses.


1105
01:13:37.395 --> 01:13:40.895
<i>It's planned for Friday night.
The Total gas station at Lionville.</i>


1106
01:13:41.395 --> 01:13:43.603
- Well done.
- <i>Your stock must be close by.</i>


1107
01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:44.520
Very good.

1108
01:13:46.978 --> 01:13:48.520
Thanks, Jacques
-Yves.

1109
01:13:48.603 --> 01:13:49.561
Good night.

1110
01:13:50.978 --> 01:13:52.186
Same to you.

1111
01:14:10.811 --> 01:14:11.811
Sephora Rivoli.

1112
01:14:14.645 --> 01:14:15.853
Sephora Rivoli.

1113
01:14:47.311 --> 01:14:48.228
Coffee?

1114
01:15:03.978 --> 01:15:05.103
Okay, it's Mourad.

1115
01:15:05.603 --> 01:15:06.645
Let's go!

1116
01:15:08.145 --> 01:15:08.978
Hey!

1117
01:15:10.686 --> 01:15:11.603
They're off.

1118
01:15:31.145 --> 01:15:32.686
Drop that, damn it!

1119
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:36.436
- I swear I didn't do anything!
- Get down!


1120
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.353
Get out!

1121
01:15:38.395 --> 01:15:40.145
- Get out!
- Move!


1122
01:15:40.686 --> 01:15:42.311
Get out!

1123
01:15:42.395 --> 01:15:44.520
Shut up! Give me your hands!

1124
01:15:49.353 --> 01:15:51.395
Don't shoot! I have kids, please!

1125
01:15:51.478 --> 01:15:53.353
Shut your mouth!

1126
01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:05.770
The door!

1127
01:16:11.145 --> 01:16:11.978
Come on!

1128
01:16:13.686 --> 01:16:14.811
Let's go!

1129
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:16.603
Where's Ange?

1130
01:16:16.686 --> 01:16:18.020
I thought he was with you.

1131
01:16:18.103 --> 01:16:21.020
Okay, forget it! Let's go! 
To the quarry!

1132
01:16:26.978 --> 01:16:29.603
<i>- Have you located my stock?
- Not yet, but I'm close.</i>


1133
01:16:30.103 --> 01:16:32.353
- Where are you?
- <i>In one of your trucks.</i>


1134
01:16:33.645 --> 01:16:36.728
<i>Thing is, my price has changed.
I'm taking too many risks.</i>


1135
01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.270
No pay without proof.

1136
01:16:43.811 --> 01:16:45.311
Another three and we're good.

1137
01:16:45.811 --> 01:16:47.895
- Are we on schedule?
- We should get going.


1138
01:16:57.270 --> 01:17:00.395
It's sad to have to leave
two brand-new trucks behind.


1139
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.770
- Find yourself a woman, bro.
- What's the connection?


1140
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:06.520
- Fuck.
- What's wrong?


1141
01:17:07.061 --> 01:17:10.728
- I'm not getting through to Boss.
- They must be at the quarry.


1142
01:17:10.811 --> 01:17:12.436
They'll call us from the road.

1143
01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:47.936
UNDELIVERED

1144
01:18:02.228 --> 01:18:03.061
Shit!

1145
01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:19.978
Where is that dog?

1146
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:25.436
Motherfucker.
He used the hedgehog trap, look.


1147
01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.853
- The dog!
- Fuck! Look!


1148
01:18:30.145 --> 01:18:31.061
Fuck.

1149
01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.353
Damn it.

1150
01:18:39.311 --> 01:18:43.853
<i>The son of a bitch asked Breuil
for 200,000 euros to turn us in.</i>


1151
01:18:49.978 --> 01:18:52.186
<i>Monday at 7:45 a.m.,</i>

1152
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:55.395
<i>hair combed to the right,
tortoiseshell glasses, and Hermès ties,</i>


1153
01:18:55.478 --> 01:18:58.228
<i>Nougarolis's auditors arrived.</i>

1154
01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.645
Okay. Shall we start?

1155
01:19:20.853 --> 01:19:21.853
Étienne, summary.

1156
01:19:22.686 --> 01:19:24.811
In line with KP2M protocols,

1157
01:19:24.895 --> 01:19:28.436
we cross-checked the data
on the company software


1158
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.270
with the physical stock inventory.

1159
01:19:32.353 --> 01:19:35.561
This was carried out
by taking samples from 320 boxes.


1160
01:19:36.853 --> 01:19:39.103
- What did that give us in the end?
- We get...


1161
01:19:39.186 --> 01:19:41.895
<i>Unlike Nougarolis, 
I was born in Chartres.</i>

1162
01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:44.478
<i>And unlike him, 
I learned this at birth.</i>

1163
01:19:44.561 --> 01:19:49.103
The inventory confirms
the quantities declared by the seller


1164
01:19:49.186 --> 01:19:51.186
at the signing
of the agreement in principle.


1165
01:19:53.478 --> 01:19:55.936
- Nothing's missing?
- It's marginal, sir.


1166
01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:57.686
<i>The Breuils always win.</i>

1167
01:19:58.186 --> 01:19:59.020
Brice.

1168
01:20:02.895 --> 01:20:05.853
<i>You want to know
how little Patrick saved his skin?</i>


1169
01:20:10.895 --> 01:20:12.145
<i>Remember that night?</i>

1170
01:20:13.728 --> 01:20:15.145
- Hello?
<i>- Sauveur.</i>


1171
01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:16.770
<i>We need to meet.</i>

1172
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:19.561
<i>The cathedral. Now.</i>

1173
01:20:38.603 --> 01:20:43.603
TO ARMAND BREUIL
FROM THE GRATEFUL TOWN OF CHARTRES


1174
01:21:21.978 --> 01:21:23.686
You know we went to school together?

1175
01:21:25.895 --> 01:21:28.270
- At Jean Moulin.
- Doesn't ring a bell.


1176
01:21:30.061 --> 01:21:31.311
I remember you well.

1177
01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.436
What do you want?

1178
01:21:37.395 --> 01:21:39.561
I bought some information from your team...

1179
01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:43.770
I have your names. 
Pictures of your house.

1180
01:21:43.853 --> 01:21:46.561
...with the hundreds of thousands
of euros in cash


1181
01:21:47.645 --> 01:21:49.103
which you're giving back to me.

1182
01:21:51.603 --> 01:21:53.228
Why didn't you call the police?

1183
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:56.853
Because I'm selling.

1184
01:21:58.728 --> 01:21:59.561
When?

1185
01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.436
We already signed. 
That's the issue.

1186
01:22:04.061 --> 01:22:07.978
There's too much perfume missing for
the audit to go the way it needs to go.


1187
01:22:09.645 --> 01:22:14.311
I want all the products that you stole
to find their way back to my warehouse.


1188
01:22:15.686 --> 01:22:16.520
Immediately.

1189
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:19.520
That's going to be tricky. 
I sold it all.

1190
01:22:23.436 --> 01:22:25.395
I'd have preferred to avoid this.

1191
01:22:25.936 --> 01:22:27.978
<i>Here's little Patrick's plan B.</i>

1192
01:22:28.061 --> 01:22:29.353
<i>To avoid prison,</i>

1193
01:22:29.436 --> 01:22:33.020
<i>I had to fill two trucks with
an amount equal to the missing stock.</i>


1194
01:22:33.103 --> 01:22:36.020
<i>I stole them, as you know.
The insurance covered it.</i>


1195
01:22:36.103 --> 01:22:38.686
<i>We then replaced the stolen boxes
in the inventory.</i>


1196
01:22:39.436 --> 01:22:41.395
<i>The auditors wouldn't notice shit,</i>

1197
01:22:41.478 --> 01:22:44.436
<i>and Nougarolis, who thought
he was going to pay Breuil half,</i>


1198
01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.395
<i>would have to pay full price.</i>

1199
01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.061
It's that or the police.

1200
01:22:48.145 --> 01:22:49.853
<i>Except that in this story,</i>

1201
01:22:49.936 --> 01:22:52.478
<i>we did all the work and made shit.</i>

1202
01:22:52.561 --> 01:22:53.645
<i>As usual.</i>

1203
01:22:53.728 --> 01:22:57.228
And for me, that doesn't work anymore.
So let's follow my plan instead.


1204
01:22:57.895 --> 01:22:59.228
Admire the artist.

1205
01:22:59.311 --> 01:23:01.020
Wait, your story isn't clear.

1206
01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:03.311
I'll do your robbery.

1207
01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:06.020
But only if you tell me everything.
Don't hide anything.


1208
01:23:09.228 --> 01:23:10.103
My wife.

1209
01:23:13.103 --> 01:23:15.020
She talked me into selling.

1210
01:23:16.228 --> 01:23:17.645
And into selling to Nougarolis.

1211
01:23:18.936 --> 01:23:19.811
They are...

1212
01:23:21.895 --> 01:23:22.936
close.

1213
01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:30.353
So you want to hurt them.

1214
01:23:32.478 --> 01:23:33.311
Okay.

1215
01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.770
I'll do the robbery,
but whatever I steal is mine.


1216
01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:41.853
You don't get it, Sauveur.

1217
01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:47.395
All my products come back to me.

1218
01:23:47.978 --> 01:23:48.895
Calm down, man.

1219
01:23:49.728 --> 01:23:50.603
Imagine

1220
01:23:51.936 --> 01:23:56.145
<i>if people realized that the products
prepared by Breuil for Colin Brown</i>


1221
01:23:57.103 --> 01:23:58.270
<i>don't contain perfume.</i>

1222
01:24:00.311 --> 01:24:01.186
<i>What would happen?</i>

1223
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:02.811
<i>It would be a huge scandal.</i>

1224
01:24:03.311 --> 01:24:06.728
<i>We agree that Breuil & Sons
can't afford that kind of setback.</i>


1225
01:24:06.811 --> 01:24:08.686
<i>It'd be a lot more than a setback.</i>

1226
01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:11.603
<i>All our clients would terminate
their distribution contracts.</i>


1227
01:24:11.686 --> 01:24:12.811
<i>It would finish us.</i>

1228
01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.853
<i>Us? You mean Nougarolis?</i>

1229
01:24:14.936 --> 01:24:17.978
- What is this shit?
- It's water.


1230
01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.186
Nougarolis.

1231
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:24.728
Listen to me, boss.

1232
01:24:25.853 --> 01:24:29.895
We'll do the robbery.
Then we sabotage the perfume stock.


1233
01:24:30.603 --> 01:24:32.145
<i>This is how it'll happen.</i>

1234
01:24:32.895 --> 01:24:36.353
<i>The day after the robbery,
I'll offload all the stolen goods</i>


1235
01:24:36.436 --> 01:24:38.270
<i>into the professional sector.</i>

1236
01:24:38.853 --> 01:24:41.603
<i>They'll quickly sell it
through the black market.</i>


1237
01:24:41.686 --> 01:24:43.103
Look at that dick.

1238
01:24:43.186 --> 01:24:45.811
<i>You'll take care
of getting the insurance in place.</i>


1239
01:24:45.895 --> 01:24:46.728
They're pros.

1240
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:48.728
<i>Play it smart. 
They have to believe you.</i>

1241
01:24:48.811 --> 01:24:50.520
They must be from the Paris suburbs.

1242
01:24:50.603 --> 01:24:52.936
If they get into perfume now,
we're in deep shit.


1243
01:24:53.811 --> 01:24:56.395
Don't worry.
We have a solid case. It'll be approved.


1244
01:24:56.895 --> 01:24:59.270
Thank you. I'm counting on you.

1245
01:24:59.353 --> 01:25:03.895
<i>And after that, we'll meet at Breuil's
to make our own recipe for Gold.</i>


1246
01:25:06.395 --> 01:25:10.561
<i>You have thousands of empty bottles
waiting to be filled by your machines.</i>


1247
01:25:13.686 --> 01:25:17.853
<i>I have the perfect team
for implementing this gigantic plan.</i>


1248
01:25:20.478 --> 01:25:24.978
<i>Without them, it'd be impossible to pack
everything up into boxes and pallets</i>


1249
01:25:25.478 --> 01:25:26.395
<i>in just one night.</i>

1250
01:25:27.895 --> 01:25:28.978
Let's go, guys!

1251
01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.228
<i>And once we've stuffed your stock
with thousands of liters of water,</i>


1252
01:25:35.311 --> 01:25:38.311
<i>I can tell you that
we'll give Nougarolis a good cleansing.</i>


1253
01:25:43.228 --> 01:25:45.645
<i>One last thing before we agree on this.</i>

1254
01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.645
<i>You'll help get
the bastard that betrayed me.</i>


1255
01:25:50.561 --> 01:25:53.103
- Yeah?
- <i>I got your message. Where is he?</i>


1256
01:25:53.728 --> 01:25:56.353
He was in the back of a truck
on the way to your barn.


1257
01:25:56.436 --> 01:25:59.186
<i>That motherfucker.
We're not there anymore. I'll head back.</i>


1258
01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:01.270
Look at that son
of a bitch. Go on.

1259
01:26:38.145 --> 01:26:38.978
Fuck!

1260
01:26:51.145 --> 01:26:55.520
SAUVEUR, A COSMETIC VALLEY NEWCOMER

1261
01:27:11.186 --> 01:27:12.645
Did you have that put there?

1262
01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.103
It's not like I didn't owe him anything.

1263
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:17.228
That's true.

1264
01:27:20.395 --> 01:27:21.853
I came to say goodbye.

1265
01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.353
That's it. You're leaving?

1266
01:27:25.978 --> 01:27:26.978
It's about time.

1267
01:27:29.145 --> 01:27:30.145
What about you?

1268
01:27:30.936 --> 01:27:32.895
This isn't the time
for me to go anywhere.

1269
01:27:33.895 --> 01:27:38.020
I'm guessing you saw the report on
the water scandal in the perfume world?


1270
01:27:38.811 --> 01:27:41.311
Now that Nougarolis is out of the picture,

1271
01:27:41.978 --> 01:27:44.561
we're going to buy his business
through Sauveur & Sons.


1272
01:27:45.061 --> 01:27:48.103
I have a meeting with Jacques-Yves
to discuss distribution.


1273
01:27:48.978 --> 01:27:50.395
Then I'll make my offer.

1274
01:27:52.561 --> 01:27:53.811
What about my suggestion?

1275
01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:55.520
What? To invest?

1276
01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:58.436
I told you to keep it.
I don't want your money.


1277
01:27:58.936 --> 01:27:59.936
Use it as you wish.

1278
01:28:08.061 --> 01:28:11.478
By the way, there was something
I promised not to tell you.


1279
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:16.728
The whole idea about the robbery,
the insurance. It wasn't my idea.


1280
01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.353
Whose was it?

1281
01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.478
There's an angel watching over you,
Daniel.


1282
01:28:23.436 --> 01:28:24.395
A blonde angel.

1283
01:28:37.436 --> 01:28:38.436
So?

1284
01:28:39.228 --> 01:28:40.228
Is that flair?
