1
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.947
I did everything I could,
but the bank does not understand.


2
00:00:59.948 --> 00:01:02.910
If we do not have the 50 thousand
U.S. dollars payment within 7 days...


3
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.790
...lose the workshop.

4
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.726
Can I really do that?

5
00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:10.390
There's me, is the bank.

6
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.890
You are the bank, Warner.

7
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:16.590
How am I? The truth is that only
manage small accounts.


8
00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:19.490
If I give you another extension,
I said goodbye.


9
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.290
You can find another job...

10
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.590
...but this workshop is irreplaceable.

11
00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:27.190
Do we really expect
sacrifice my career for you?


12
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.390
What you do if you really interested.

13
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.190
You know that if...

14
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.290
...but I did all I could.

15
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:42.890
Sorry, Katie.
It's nothing personal.


16
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.590
Everything about this workshop,
is personal for me.


17
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:48.290
My father built it,
my brother died for him...


18
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.390
...is not only the workshop, Warner.

19
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.890
Perhaps this is a problem.

20
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.891
Then...

21
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.790
- How did it go with the bank?
- Very good.


22
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.590
It impressed by
my business plans...


23
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.240
...and seduced by my charms.

24
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.790
Already established a plan
Pay with them.


25
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.830
I thought we'd done
So last month.


26
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:14.790
And I did it again this month.

27
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.690
Listen... boys
are hungry.


28
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:20.530
So I think it
would be a good idea...

29
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:24.230
...if we do we bring
a couple of pizzas.


30
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.990
It is an excellent idea, Charlie.

31
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:30.490
Let's have fun with
the boy pizzas.


32
00:02:32.898 --> 00:02:36.117
I do not understand that
is so annoying, officer.


33
00:02:36.118 --> 00:02:37.510
Detective.

34
00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:39.790
And the sidewalk is where
people walk...


35
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:41.540
...there is where
van cars.


36
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:43.590
That's why we call streets.

37
00:02:43.803 --> 00:02:47.350
There were many cars in the middle,
that's why I decided to use the sidewalk.


38
00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:49.290
Pudo having killed someone.

39
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.570
If. I needed to do
either something stupid.


40
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:56.860
So I do a big favour,
making me a fine.


41
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.580
Tómalo how... natural selection.

42
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.850
Do you want... I will multe
a traffic violation?


43
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.314
What we wanted was to see annoying.

44
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.290
Y... judging by your appearance,
I think it worked.


45
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.940
Do not press me, ma'am.

46
00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:23.460
Pressure is what makes it fun.
You should try it sometime.


47
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.990
Damn!

48
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.135
She cree the owner of the world.

49
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.510
It is.

50
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:40.217
Look, just because they are young,
rich and sexy...


51
00:03:40.218 --> 00:03:42.130
What else can it be?

52
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.166
I need a crane.
Ah.. and a Expresso.


53
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.830
3 minutes late,

54
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.290
What kind of imbecile calls for free pizza,
for a delay of 3 minutes?


55
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.825
The rate of those who want something
for free. How the whole world on the planet.


56
00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:22.290
It is too, so I
has claimed this month.


57
00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:25.040
Do not cost anything, Sal.
What I pay my discounts.


58
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:26.041
One moment, please.

59
00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:28.890
If you arrive late again,
you will not pay.


60
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.867
You have 15 minutes to deliver these.

61
00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:33.520
Think you can accomplish?

62
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.090
I do jumping
in one foot.


63
00:04:47.034 --> 00:04:48.610
Come on!

64
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.520
<i>Calling all units,
there is a robbery in progress...</i>


65
00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:12.390
<i>suspects are...
are armed and dangerous.</i>


66
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:16.021
<i>They were last seen,
in Lashre and Schurmann.</i>


67
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.530
Try not to go too fast.

68
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.990
Shit! It is the police!

69
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.054
Do something, man!

70
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.540
What I'm doing.

71
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.311
- Go more slowly.
- I do not want to lose him.


72
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.490
- It's better than stars.
- We will not.


73
00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:04.111
Come on, man!

74
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.660
Apartat of my way!

75
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.370
Take it calmly!

76
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.250
There are 2 of them!
They are on our ass! Come on!


77
00:06:30.255 --> 00:06:31.890
It is too fast.

78
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.120
Oh, hell!

79
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.910
Move back!
I'm going to be late!


80
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.791
More slowly!
Be careful with this car!


81
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.570
- Trying to kill?
- Try to grab such.


82
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:29.871
It's the same thing.

83
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.990
Tómalo calmly!

84
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.150
That's it! For!

85
00:07:57.151 --> 00:07:58.151
Yes, Mr!

86
00:08:09.925 --> 00:08:12.050
What carajo!

87
00:08:38.222 --> 00:08:41.714
One minute and 10 seconds late!
Thank you for free pizzas.


88
00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:43.015
Is not what you do, or do you?

89
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.090
Was your crane which I delayed?

90
00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:56.322
You have a crane outside, you could
have sought pizzas yourself.


91
00:08:56.323 --> 00:08:58.390
But then had not been free.

92
00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:25.830
Lindo car.

93
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.090
It was my husband, was drunk.

94
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:30.790
I could not where
it was going to take.

95
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.750
She must be conducted savagely.

96
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:34.390
Who says that this is not the case?

97
00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:36.850
It is a tragedy.

98
00:09:36.851 --> 00:09:40.490
It is a high performance vehicle.
Must be driven hard and fast.


99
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.491
All the time.

100
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.740
That means that if
stands much time on it...


101
00:09:45.741 --> 00:09:48.860
...decks lose air,
transmission is oxidized...


102
00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:51.190
and fuel expires.
I know what he means.


103
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.390
These cars require
Pistons well lubricated.


104
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.705
How do you know?

105
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.290
I've seen a couple of engines.

106
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.440
My kids are hungry,
and the pizza is cooling.


107
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.790
Should not bring food?

108
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.190
Stay with the change.

109
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.900
Thanks for the Council,
Pizza man.


110
00:10:14.891 --> 00:10:17.660
It's all good. 
You have my number.

111
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.690
In general, is
how something simple...


112
00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:27.691
Gasoline old rubbish...
stuck in the filter...


113
00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:30.790
...or a weak battery.
But, whatever, Mrs. Devereaux.


114
00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.290
It will be ready to take
tomorrow afternoon.


115
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.290
You're the mechanic?

116
00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:38.291
Do not carry this clothing
to be in fashion.


117
00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:41.490
Of course not.
But why did not he carries?


118
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.390
By the way, perhaps you should be set at,
Samples that if you're a woman.


119
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.310
I do not need
anyone be fixed at me.

120
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.310
We call for the cost,
before doing the job.


121
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:54.591
Do not worry. Only arreglalo.

122
00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:00.205
Perra!

123
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.250
Do we really believe we
an opportunity with this woman?


124
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.662
Why not?
Why is married, and is rich.


125
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.410
The women how she,
how leeches are social...


126
00:11:14.411 --> 00:11:16.440
...and only fixing in men,
they can deal with them.


127
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.060
And you're just a
pizza deliveryman.


128
00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:23.010
Then I change my life.
Let me run for you.


129
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:25.420
You can not lead or
a pizza on time.


130
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.930
I am the best!

131
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.640
Give me the keys to the Ford,
and 5 minutes of your time...


132
00:11:30.641 --> 00:11:33.790
...and you take a walk,
you despeinará hair.


133
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.025
I can not.

134
00:11:36.026 --> 00:11:39.490
Customers expect their cars,
I can not take your time.


135
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.980
Perhaps a bit.

136
00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:43.350
Yes, today I met with Warner.
To that I referred.


137
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.930
Not everything that says a woman,
is a reflection of his men.


138
00:11:46.931 --> 00:11:48.531
If it is!

139
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.850
Grow!

140
00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:52.460
Well. When Ford is ready...

141
00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:55.504
...adjust according to what my
standards, and we are on careers.


142
00:11:55.505 --> 00:11:57.215
And who will be the driver?

143
00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.760
When the Ford is ready,
need a driver...


144
00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.391
...and I'm that type.

145
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.590
You what I will try.

146
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:05.790
Are you sure you with something
not start with a kick?


147
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.690
The motorcycle! Oh, hell!

148
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.612
I need this car in
running the streets...


149
00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:17.290
...not earn any money,
while here in the workshop.


150
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:19.750
Forge can fix it.
Can I run for you?


151
00:12:21.902 --> 00:12:24.016
First the pizza deliveryman.
Are you now?


152
00:12:24.017 --> 00:12:27.490
You do not have license, you're lucky
you leave the car park.


153
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:30.290
Your mother will return soon,
and I will kill you if I stop doing that.


154
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.990
Mom will return to Germany after
that was the fourth husband divorced.


155
00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:38.555
The fifth is already
on its way, I know.

156
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.590
The cars are how women, boy.

157
00:12:42.923 --> 00:12:46.790
Give them a lot of drinking,
not make them go faster.


158
00:12:46.791 --> 00:12:49.903
Only got drunk,
and you vomit over...


159
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.610
...before falling asleep,
after that.


160
00:12:52.611 --> 00:12:55.490
Then... How do you know
if the service did you do?


161
00:12:55.491 --> 00:12:56.491
You're wrong.

162
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.290
Who says?

163
00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:00.390
I said that.
Measure times...


164
00:13:00.391 --> 00:13:02.666
...pressure fuel,
maneuverability, oil pressure...


165
00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:04.990
...everything is here, and it is perfect.

166
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.090
Listen.

167
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.090
Who's the mechanic here?
Do you... or the computer?


168
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.390
It's me.

169
00:13:14.391 --> 00:13:16.590
Then how one starts working.

170
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.790
A true mechanic.

171
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.390
Watch.

172
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.190
Sientelo.

173
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.390
Listen.

174
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.716
What this car tells you,
how a fuel sensor...


175
00:13:31.717 --> 00:13:35.872
...is that it will be much better,
if confundirte avoid.


176
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.690
Takes.

177
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:39.190
It deals a little with my program.

178
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.090
When will you begin
write reports?


179
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.410
And where you'll be?

180
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:49.990
I will be in the library,
reading a bit.


181
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.390
Excuse me, sir.

182
00:13:57.515 --> 00:14:00.890
But we need to investigate
theft this afternoon.


183
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.023
I do not know. Treatment
investigate this pudding...


184
00:14:04.024 --> 00:14:05.870
and do not want to be...
interrupted.


185
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.440
I was in pursuit.

186
00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:10.190
You are going to be the same novice,
while I have my plate.


187
00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:11.620
Yes, sir.

188
00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:15.251
Can I ask you a question?

189
00:14:15.252 --> 00:14:19.030
Why does someone steal a cup of coffee?
They have very little money.


190
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:20.470
It's a cover.

191
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:23.090
They must have an operation
money laundering.


192
00:14:23.456 --> 00:14:25.490
Stan has been dealing
the business of the game...


193
00:14:25.491 --> 00:14:27.150
...in this territory,
and is good at that.


194
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.940
But would steal a suicide.

195
00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:31.290
Not if you think you're more
big as him.


196
00:14:31.723 --> 00:14:34.690
I think it was a banda
Gregor Gargolov.


197
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.270
The gangster who wears today,
insurance are forcibly...


198
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:38.640
...responsible for conquer
Stan territory.


199
00:14:38.641 --> 00:14:40.420
Do you think that we can arrest them?

200
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.920
All were working
in the case of coffee...


201
00:14:42.921 --> 00:14:44.290
...before we reached us.

202
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:45.590
Then...

203
00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:48.090
We have no victims or witnesses...

204
00:14:48.091 --> 00:14:51.790
It's just a robbery, and there is no
no evidence useful.


205
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.680
What is the cause for concern?

206
00:14:53.681 --> 00:14:56.470
Because officers were 2
Wounded persecution.


207
00:14:56.471 --> 00:14:57.690
Sorry for them...

208
00:14:57.691 --> 00:15:01.140
...but my experience tells me
that this case will be closed soon.


209
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.141
What if this close?

210
00:15:03.142 --> 00:15:05.790
Probably those involved
will be pressing.


211
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.112
Can you say something about who
is responsible in this case?


212
00:15:09.113 --> 00:15:10.790
I would like to help.

213
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.290
I think we need strength
extra day and night.


214
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.760
If force is the land that
needed, I am your man.


215
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.698
Do you know anything you can do
to put pressure on these guys?


216
00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:21.290
Yes, Mr!

217
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.990
Let me finish my damned
lunch in peace.


218
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.056
The blue devil is going to the front,
entering the sector.


219
00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:48.785
How much money pusiste
in this race?


220
00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:51.390
Everything that was me.

221
00:15:51.391 --> 00:15:52.391
...and another thousand in this.

222
00:15:52.392 --> 00:15:53.490
Is that all?

223
00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:55.960
It is hard to maintain
cars in good condition.


224
00:15:55.961 --> 00:15:58.290
Everything we do is make them
points and oil changes.


225
00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.970
Then... Why you did?

226
00:15:59.971 --> 00:16:03.332
Someone has to keep their engines,
and change their tyres.


227
00:16:03.333 --> 00:16:06.190
Doubles only that corner.
Did you achieve?


228
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.300
There are!. In addition, customers are.

229
00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:13.156
If you do not get 50 large in 6 days
the bank will stay with the workshop.


230
00:16:13.157 --> 00:16:14.540
Will 6 days?

231
00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:16.541
How you do that?

232
00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.490
While in all races,
and betting our drivers.


233
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:21.815
Only I say this because
we are family...


234
00:16:21.816 --> 00:16:23.990
...and so you apures
in repairing the Ford.


235
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.754
But if you say a word of
this in the workshop...


236
00:16:26.755 --> 00:16:29.200
...you beaten to death
with your laptop.


237
00:16:29.201 --> 00:16:30.990
I thought that the workshop
We were family.


238
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.670
That is different.

239
00:16:32.671 --> 00:16:35.030
If it were not, would not have
anyone that it would be.


240
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.512
How win today?

241
00:16:40.513 --> 00:16:42.062
4, maybe 5 thousand...

242
00:16:42.063 --> 00:16:43.890
...depends on how much there is at stake.

243
00:16:44.134 --> 00:16:45.670
And if we lose?

244
00:16:47.637 --> 00:16:49.390
It's all in Ford
and the Cyber morning.


245
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.270
This kind if he knows lead.

246
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:22.290
Anyone can drive.

247
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.090
Encuentrénme someone
that can compete.


248
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.235
Salame and cheese.
It's how you like, Dork.


249
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.860
<i>And the winner is... the devil blue!</i>

250
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.371
You have ghost driver
to lose one of these days.


251
00:18:17.372 --> 00:18:19.810
- Want to bet?
- Always.


252
00:18:19.811 --> 00:18:22.790
Hey, Wolf...

253
00:18:22.791 --> 00:18:25.090
Will came to running,
or take a nap?


254
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.740
Well. Who wants to beat Wolf?

255
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.790
Come on, there must be
someone with balls!


256
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.790
I do not know your pizza.

257
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.580
Perhaps you should...

258
00:18:46.581 --> 00:18:49.690
...and the cowards have to eat,
while watching the men running.


259
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.691
$ 500 bet.
If you have the cash.


260
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.690
No, but forget the money
and runs with me.


261
00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.140
Why would it?

262
00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.210
Because if not, look like you're using
the money as an excuse.


263
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.390
All will know that you have
fear of losing me.


264
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.990
If you're smart, you will.

265
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.760
Need an incentive.

266
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.790
The car is not mine.

267
00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:19.460
Oh... Do not tell me boy dealer?

268
00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:24.230
If I win, I want your hand...

269
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.490
Now let's see who is the coward.

270
00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:32.965
Do not talk seriously?

271
00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:38.352
I took this bet.

272
00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.590
Anyone who can not
Ukrainian defeat a dog...


273
00:19:41.591 --> 00:19:45.253
...on American soil, deserves
losing his dirty hand.


274
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.460
Yes, that's okay.

275
00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:52.690
I am inside.

276
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.790
If I win, I want the money,
and your Ipod.


277
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.660
Cálmense!

278
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.070
<i>guy from the pizza win!</i>

279
00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:04.240
Where to learn
driving well, man?


280
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.790
It's nothing, man.

281
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:09.090
It was a Test Drive
very silly to me.


282
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.890
I thought we should try.

283
00:23:15.904 --> 00:23:17.890
I think I should an Ipod.

284
00:23:29.177 --> 00:23:31.934
I hope you have something
of Neil Diamond.


285
00:24:40.054 --> 00:24:41.810
I wish that we had not
to hide.


286
00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.690
Whether you go very wrong, how to
leave with a man like me.


287
00:24:46.234 --> 00:24:48.290
The street racing is illegal.

288
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.614
I lose my plate, if my
chief learns what I did.


289
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.626
It could lose their lives, whether
brokers believe that treason.


290
00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:57.290
Did not.

291
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.291
Not yet.

292
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.114
Some types, robbed the bank
an operation to launder money.


293
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.790
I think we were street racers.

294
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.590
How do you know?

295
00:25:10.316 --> 00:25:12.790
The way to lead is unique,
is how the way you...


296
00:25:12.791 --> 00:25:13.791
Do Cojo?

297
00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:17.260
I was going to say, work.

298
00:25:19.462 --> 00:25:22.690
I saw Wolf, make some
how shaky yesterday.


299
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.730
You are trying to save the workshop,
and beat all runners.


300
00:25:27.432 --> 00:25:30.582
If I arrest Wolf,
VIR might against their heads...


301
00:25:30.583 --> 00:25:32.960
...might help me in my career.

302
00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:34.160
What would you stop?

303
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.790
I can not arrest Wolf,
without an order from my superiors.


304
00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:39.690
And they refuse to dármela.

305
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.440
It is all lies.

306
00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:44.201
How can understand that?

307
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.790
It is because you are too hard.

308
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.871
It was a few minutes ago.

309
00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.810
Want you double?

310
00:25:55.811 --> 00:25:58.790
Until the money knows
that can be used well.


311
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:02.690
Okay. It was a way of
get information.


312
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.065
Are you concerned that the police find out
you're a runner street?


313
00:26:10.066 --> 00:26:11.266
Why did you do?

314
00:26:15.101 --> 00:26:18.770
I never imagined that I stars
against a wall. It was terrible.


315
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.390
Never knew what happened afterwards.

316
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.206
I had no control at the races.

317
00:26:24.207 --> 00:26:25.610
Nobody has it.

318
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.660
I do not want anything to happen to me
So how in my life again.


319
00:26:29.915 --> 00:26:31.810
I am good driving a car.
Do not you think?


320
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.610
I feel that I have control of everything.

321
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.640
Experiment total calm.
Real Peace.


322
00:26:42.218 --> 00:26:44.224
It is how to be here with you.

323
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.840
Why do you think I control?

324
00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.942
No. Because I love you.

325
00:26:51.217 --> 00:26:53.890
I do not think that is racing
for much longer.


326
00:26:54.907 --> 00:26:56.590
Do not like how I drive?

327
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.710
No. I love a lot.

328
00:27:00.154 --> 00:27:02.590
But if you do not get 50 large

329
00:27:02.591 --> 00:27:04.590
the bank... I will remove the workshop.

330
00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:08.410
What's with this workshop?
Whether you find another.


331
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.190
How can you say that?

332
00:27:12.034 --> 00:27:14.422
Not only is the workshop, Eric.

333
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.220
My mother died when
I was 3 years...


334
00:27:21.221 --> 00:27:24.790
...my father when I was 16,
my brother when he was 19.


335
00:27:27.516 --> 00:27:29.944
This workshop is the only thing
share.


336
00:27:29.945 --> 00:27:31.790
If you lose...

337
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.160
...I lose them.

338
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.790
Then...

339
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.510
You win.

340
00:27:45.644 --> 00:27:47.650
How can you be sure?

341
00:27:49.423 --> 00:27:50.975
Win the next race.

342
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.930
And another after that.

343
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.250
And after another.

344
00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:57.121
Until you have your money.

345
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.750
You can not know that.

346
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:04.890
I promise.

347
00:28:13.604 --> 00:28:15.620
Let me teach you how to drive.

348
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.570
Do You Hear that?

349
00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:24.843
What? It's just someone driving.

350
00:28:24.844 --> 00:28:28.190
It is the BMW of the blonde,
Got it the radiator.


351
00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:29.140
So what?

352
00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:32.330
That car has given me problems,
since it came into my workshop yesterday.


353
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.990
Suéltame!

354
00:28:38.991 --> 00:28:41.180
- Did you're going to strike back?
- No, I'm going to kill.


355
00:28:41.181 --> 00:28:42.181
Calm down!

356
00:28:42.182 --> 00:28:44.320
It was that the car looks bad,
but... I won the race!


357
00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:48.180
I took a little for rental,
gambling debts...


358
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:49.970
...but the rest is yours.

359
00:28:49.971 --> 00:28:52.370
This is only the beginning of the
I can win for us.


360
00:28:54.026 --> 00:28:55.040
There are 4 great!

361
00:28:55.041 --> 00:28:57.590
That does not cover damage to my
you did in that car!


362
00:28:57.591 --> 00:29:00.890
This idiot, I am going to cost money
that I won the race yesterday...


363
00:29:00.891 --> 00:29:02.890
...and much more.

364
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:04.980
- Really?
- Oh, if!


365
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.990
- No!
- Why not?


366
00:29:07.991 --> 00:29:10.490
- Because you going to hit!
- You can try!


367
00:29:11.375 --> 00:29:13.590
Do you know? Strips blows
how Doblas curves...


368
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:15.890
...you put too much style.
- Who says?


369
00:29:15.891 --> 00:29:19.176
My instinct. That's why we kicked the
Rear here, or on the road.


370
00:29:19.177 --> 00:29:20.390
- You decide.
- How about now?


371
00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:23.725
The customer comes in the car tomorrow.
What would you say?


372
00:29:24.726 --> 00:29:26.570
It is only a small!

373
00:29:26.571 --> 00:29:29.410
This is a workshop, you can
fix it. It's what you do.


374
00:29:29.884 --> 00:29:31.370
It was what he was doing.

375
00:29:35.763 --> 00:29:37.090
Katie!
Come on!


376
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.080
What's your problem?

377
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.190
There is enough for both.

378
00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:46.590
I do not think so.

379
00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.680
Are you afraid that I see driving?

380
00:29:49.353 --> 00:29:51.190
You will become a memory.

381
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:54.390
I am afraid that you do not see what more
important in their lives.


382
00:29:55.027 --> 00:29:57.510
Do you? You can get something better.

383
00:29:57.511 --> 00:29:58.990
This workshop...

384
00:30:00.234 --> 00:30:02.890
If you do not
pay in 6 days, disappears.

385
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:04.790
Just more open hole.

386
00:30:04.791 --> 00:30:07.490
If she loses her business,
you finish.


387
00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.045
Oh, boy!

388
00:30:59.931 --> 00:31:01.820
It should be a great
Working plate...


389
00:31:01.821 --> 00:31:03.990
...replace the mouth
fuel.


390
00:31:03.991 --> 00:31:08.090
Fix the radiator,
and welding the clutch.


391
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.390
I hope I have wrong.

392
00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:16.053
Is there anything you do not need
be fixed?


393
00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.290
The upholstery might be intact.

394
00:31:19.013 --> 00:31:20.190
Well!

395
00:31:20.191 --> 00:31:21.801
Perhaps were very
occupied admiration...


396
00:31:21.802 --> 00:31:23.790
...how to assess
rest of the damage.


397
00:31:23.791 --> 00:31:25.390
I do not think so.

398
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:27.376
What happened to my husband indictment?

399
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.290
Yo.

400
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.490
There was a race yesterday.

401
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.660
And I wanted to go, so...

402
00:31:35.615 --> 00:31:37.032
Borrow your car.

403
00:31:37.033 --> 00:31:38.490
And you you left off?

404
00:31:38.491 --> 00:31:40.490
No. Cúlpame to me, I took it.

405
00:31:40.491 --> 00:31:42.790
- Why?
- I needed the money.


406
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.140
Y...

407
00:31:45.141 --> 00:31:47.420
...the truth, I wanted to show
Katie to what could be done.


408
00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:49.490
So, you can destroy cars?

409
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.790
I am very good conductor.

410
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:55.090
Just give me the opportunity,
or I myself.


411
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:57.630
Watch. If you want to call
the police? Okay...


412
00:31:57.631 --> 00:31:59.290
...I will stay to be arrested.
Otherwise...


413
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.820
Pagare damage, giving you everything
what they earn in the races.


414
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.450
Are you so good?

415
00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.100
I won yesterday.

416
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.602
So looks when you win?

417
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.240
Look at me.

418
00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.490
So... how it looks...
when you win.


419
00:32:19.903 --> 00:32:22.490
A car can be arranged,
only need money!


420
00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.120
You can not buy what I am!

421
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.940
Do these races... are illegal?

422
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.890
Anything as good,
usually it is.


423
00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.390
Let me mostrártelo.

424
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.255
Well, pizza man, muéstramelo.

425
00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.020
Then I will tell you that you.

426
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.990
My husband does not return until
next week.


427
00:32:54.991 --> 00:32:57.142
Until then, make them
This car runs with yours.


428
00:32:57.143 --> 00:32:59.090
Or not.

429
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.110
Do you see?
Everything will come out well.


430
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.390
- If you're lucky that this type!
- Go.


431
00:33:16.802 --> 00:33:17.802
Look!

432
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:40.530
How do?

433
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.973
When he left your car
training?


434
00:33:43.663 --> 00:33:44.974
Yesterday.

435
00:33:45.335 --> 00:33:46.660
Just before earn.

436
00:33:46.913 --> 00:33:49.190
Perhaps you shoot,
if you have a car like that.


437
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:51.605
Maybe I should shoot
face against yours.


438
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.340
Thank God llegaste
with those pizzas.


439
00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:58.790
Start.

440
00:34:00.424 --> 00:34:01.850
Please.

441
00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:15.176
You're fast!

442
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.531
What if they'd done
had been slow?


443
00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:20.790
I would have smoked a Cuban cigar...

444
00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:22.360
...and enjoyed a drink
of good white wine.


445
00:34:22.361 --> 00:34:24.390
Waiting for gourmet food.

446
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:25.830
I do not want to be interfered, but...

447
00:34:25.831 --> 00:34:27.790
...but you should not do
This whole week.


448
00:34:28.552 --> 00:34:31.200
My wife had an unexpected,
and left me with the kids...


449
00:34:31.201 --> 00:34:33.290
...and they wanted to invite
his friends.


450
00:34:33.606 --> 00:34:36.390
Now they are hungry,
and the only thing I have is caviar.


451
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.540
I hear that many
Sometimes in my work.


452
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.135
It was pizza.

453
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:42.490
Yes, pizza!

454
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.050
My name is Gregor Gargolov.

455
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:46.550
And you impressed me.

456
00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:49.832
If delayed more than 3 minutes,
the order is free.


457
00:34:49.833 --> 00:34:50.833
It is a model.

458
00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:53.110
I am talking about yesterday.

459
00:34:53.443 --> 00:34:55.590
I am something like a
fanatic careers.


460
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.015
I like how they drive.

461
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.850
- Do you know that you won your man?
- It is not over.


462
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.630
You're it.

463
00:35:07.425 --> 00:35:08.750
Does it know?

464
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:10.921
If you're smart, you know
when your time went.


465
00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.660
Perhaps only I was lucky.

466
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.590
I do not think so.

467
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.181
If driving to my...

468
00:35:21.182 --> 00:35:23.390
...you give the car,
you cover the races...


469
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:25.690
...and I'll give you 10%
of ganancías.


470
00:35:30.823 --> 00:35:33.400
I... I appreciate your offer,
Mr Gargolov, but...


471
00:35:34.425 --> 00:35:37.825
...I just want the $ 30
pizzas, and a generous tip.


472
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.890
Tired of annoying if you wonder why?

473
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.790
Any other driver,
seize this opportunity.


474
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:46.930
I imagine that I am not a
of those drivers.


475
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.590
There is more that I know...

476
00:35:58.224 --> 00:36:00.390
Is this familiar?

477
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.968
Do Brat Pitt?
Maybe Justin Timberlake?


478
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.354
Close.

479
00:36:07.355 --> 00:36:09.590
This is a police sketch,
of a thief who stole...


480
00:36:09.591 --> 00:36:11.870
...a shop in Tennessee,
last year.


481
00:36:11.871 --> 00:36:13.990
The thieves made sounded the
alarm, and captured.


482
00:36:13.991 --> 00:36:16.750
But the driver, escaped to
a dozen police cars...


483
00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:18.390
...and a helicopter.

484
00:36:18.851 --> 00:36:19.990
A great feat!

485
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.250
What happened with him?

486
00:36:23.744 --> 00:36:25.490
Nobody knows.

487
00:36:26.055 --> 00:36:29.220
But I have the hunch,
you that you were a thief.


488
00:36:32.654 --> 00:36:33.654
Dad!

489
00:36:34.194 --> 00:36:37.105
Ernie put in Pizza
DVD player.


490
00:36:38.526 --> 00:36:40.090
Okay.

491
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.030
I already there.

492
00:36:42.803 --> 00:36:44.550
So is being a parent, Mike.

493
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.660
One crisis after another.

494
00:36:46.661 --> 00:36:48.790
Already we are on the fourth
DVD player.


495
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.990
Can you find out?

496
00:36:51.233 --> 00:36:53.090
If. I have good sense
of the management.


497
00:36:53.091 --> 00:36:56.640
Well. I know that back
to see us soon.


498
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.790
More will be worth it
more fun than Bingo...


499
00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:07.090
...or take a couple of beers,
or you're going to jail.


500
00:37:56.845 --> 00:37:59.990
- How often does this happen?
- Every day, somewhere.


501
00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:01.390
And the police did not learn?

502
00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:04.790
No. It kept moving,
caring for their backs.


503
00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.390
One raid, it may happen to a
mile, and nobody knows.


504
00:38:22.434 --> 00:38:23.610
What bet?

505
00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.451
The keys to the car,
cover the bet...


506
00:38:26.452 --> 00:38:28.230
...and 20 thousand to the line.

507
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.616
Do you know something of my opponents?

508
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.936
That, the driver of the white Supra...

509
00:38:33.937 --> 00:38:37.850
...is good in narrow areas,
so be careful in grubbed.


510
00:38:37.851 --> 00:38:41.140
That's not my concern, will be tense.

511
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.255
Do you see that woman in R.S.I?

512
00:38:44.256 --> 00:38:46.980
It is a professional
the tight curves.


513
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.750
So will end in complete shock.

514
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:51.490
Sueno confident.

515
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.090
I meet my promises.

516
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.590
Do not spill.

517
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.330
Tourists!

518
00:39:50.601 --> 00:39:51.670
What is the prize?

519
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:55.730
The bet your opponent,
anything of value.


520
00:39:55.924 --> 00:39:59.060
Most do it for nothing.
Only play in the car.


521
00:39:59.061 --> 00:40:00.600
So, how to cover
the bet?


522
00:40:00.601 --> 00:40:02.506
Many can not, we must
find alguin as Katie...


523
00:40:02.507 --> 00:40:05.490
...drive their cars, and take a
percent of what they bet.


524
00:40:05.491 --> 00:40:08.601
It was my car which lead yesterday.
How then run?


525
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:18.890
I want to lead well!

526
00:40:18.891 --> 00:40:20.990
It's best to look,
is quite dangerous.


527
00:40:20.991 --> 00:40:23.120
But do not feel so
how well do it!


528
00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:25.033
It is not as easy as it sounds.

529
00:40:25.034 --> 00:40:26.390
Then, TeachMe!

530
00:40:26.391 --> 00:40:28.290
TeachMe your movements,
Pizza man!


531
00:40:33.202 --> 00:40:35.270
Would you like to leave you?

532
00:40:35.271 --> 00:40:37.290
We seek another.

533
00:41:14.133 --> 00:41:15.850
Oh, my god!

534
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.990
<i>This workshop is the only thing that remains
of what we share...</i>


535
00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.620
<i>If you lose... the lose to them.</i>

536
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.965
Thank you.

537
00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.620
Maybe next time.

538
00:41:50.464 --> 00:41:52.390
I hope that is in good condition.

539
00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:55.590
I do not want to spend money on it,
before selling it.


540
00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.170
Perhaps you want to buy it.

541
00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:01.765
She wanted to make the bet.
We are not against it.


542
00:42:01.766 --> 00:42:03.890
All they earn,
ever lose.


543
00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.550
You need a car.

544
00:42:14.971 --> 00:42:16.350
Consigámos one.

545
00:42:17.665 --> 00:42:19.690
Not for this.

546
00:43:35.153 --> 00:43:38.090
It is a waste of time
repairing this car.


547
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.472
The lady said that the arreglaramos.

548
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.910
If you start a job, terminal.

549
00:43:43.265 --> 00:43:45.090
It is going to lose workshop
anyway.


550
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.930
Well, you do not need to lose
its integrity with him.


551
00:43:52.543 --> 00:43:53.790
How are they?

552
00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.090
I do not want angustiarte...

553
00:43:57.091 --> 00:44:00.190
...but we have no credit,
Answers to buy.


554
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.290
Cash payments.

555
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.180
And where will?

556
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.590
Venda the Ford.

557
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.690
You can not.

558
00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.210
I thought we had a week
Ms. Devereaux.


559
00:44:20.211 --> 00:44:22.350
My name is Nicole, and save yourself
the problems by now.


560
00:44:22.351 --> 00:44:24.310
I'm going to give a new priority.

561
00:44:24.311 --> 00:44:26.370
I want to see me make a
auto racing.


562
00:44:28.802 --> 00:44:31.407
I have just one
I can sell.


563
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.490
Wait... Do not you
Ford talking about, no?


564
00:44:34.491 --> 00:44:36.040
It is a very good car!

565
00:44:36.041 --> 00:44:39.090
If that is so, why
you can not sell it.


566
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:40.940
You have work to do,
ve to do it!


567
00:44:40.941 --> 00:44:44.040
You can quedártelo, I am not
interested in the car of anyone.


568
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:47.490
I want to buy a new one.
And you want me manufactures a car.


569
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:50.946
I'm not toys, for
shelves of trophies wives.


570
00:44:50.947 --> 00:44:53.390
I autos, for
Serious runners.


571
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.030
Wait.

572
00:44:55.031 --> 00:44:58.226
Harás sausages to live,
if you do not get money.


573
00:44:58.227 --> 00:44:59.530
Right now!

574
00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:02.210
Make me the best car
modified for racing...


575
00:45:02.211 --> 00:45:04.435
...and forget about whatever the cost.

576
00:45:04.436 --> 00:45:08.790
I do not care how much cost.
While the car melted asphalt.


577
00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:14.910
- I think.
- Do this, because this is what I love.


578
00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:17.390
And you do not have another option.

579
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.575
This will serve to begin,
Call me when you finish.


580
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.300
Were not you supposed to say,
"Thank you, Mike, to save my rear?


581
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.490
Go here! Not back.

582
00:45:31.491 --> 00:45:33.625
That was not the appreciation
I expected.


583
00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:38.280
I can win races for you.
I need more than ever.


584
00:45:38.281 --> 00:45:40.917
I do not want to see you in
this workshop again!


585
00:45:40.918 --> 00:45:43.113
Even bringing pizza.

586
00:45:49.052 --> 00:45:50.052
Okay.

587
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.390
You were very harsh with him...

588
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:11.990
...everything you want
do is run.


589
00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.190
I heard that is good.

590
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:18.017
It is devastating, irresponsible,
and dangerous.


591
00:46:18.018 --> 00:46:19.798
How all riders
you know.


592
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.490
Only those who have died.

593
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.150
I finished with them.

594
00:46:28.151 --> 00:46:30.040
We have a car to repair,
and another to build...


595
00:46:30.041 --> 00:46:33.450
...in only 3 days
to save the workshop.


596
00:46:33.451 --> 00:46:35.110
So let us do it!

597
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.540
And the Ford?

598
00:46:38.146 --> 00:46:40.480
We stay so, for now.

599
00:46:42.632 --> 00:46:43.690
Corrado for you.

600
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:46.390
I'm so happy!

601
00:46:46.391 --> 00:46:49.610
We will make a lot of money together,
and we also have fun.


602
00:46:49.611 --> 00:46:51.290
Wait, I am your driver.

603
00:46:51.291 --> 00:46:52.090
And will remain so.

604
00:46:52.091 --> 00:46:55.620
Bring the boys to school,
and my wife shopping.


605
00:46:56.643 --> 00:46:58.472
Dale Supra keys to Mike.

606
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.450
No. Quédatelas.

607
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.040
Do not take the car to anyone.

608
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:05.990
If I'm going to drive for you
Mr Gargolov...


609
00:47:05.991 --> 00:47:08.660
...I need a car built
according to my specifications.


610
00:47:12.207 --> 00:47:13.790
Well.

611
00:47:13.791 --> 00:47:17.290
Let's go to my workshop,
and talk with my mechanics.


612
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.820
Ever lead
a aventi, Mike?


613
00:47:25.234 --> 00:47:27.790
Drove a Seat, and was afraid
to fall asleep at the wheel.


614
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:30.090
You are driving.

615
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:36.590
Listens how the engine
if a symphony.


616
00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:40.072
Each car sounds different.

617
00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:41.610
It's how...

618
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:45.540
Leopard Pearl, the BMW,
the volcanic roar...


619
00:48:45.541 --> 00:48:49.060
...the great Chevy Black...
differs from R.S.I.


620
00:48:49.061 --> 00:48:52.790
But the car that build parts
customized, is more than unique.


621
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:55.090
I remember this.

622
00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:59.190
You do not understand.

623
00:48:59.513 --> 00:49:01.210
What's with writing?

624
00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:03.211
What?

625
00:49:03.212 --> 00:49:05.790
Who says that it is not stolen,
and someone will come for him?


626
00:49:05.791 --> 00:49:09.290
Not only am rich and beautiful,
I have an education.


627
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.360
A film is sufficient
to learn that.


628
00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:15.390
What sounds so hard that?

629
00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:17.790
How the roar of a thunder.

630
00:49:17.791 --> 00:49:19.590
Let me show you to
Where was your money.


631
00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.690
We eliminate the installation
air conditioning...


632
00:49:23.691 --> 00:49:27.190
...engines windows. Basically,
everything that makes a car comfortable.


633
00:49:27.192 --> 00:49:28.290
That makes it slower.

634
00:49:28.291 --> 00:49:30.790
We take about 1000 pounds
this baby.


635
00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:34.914
To curb, has 6 packages,
in the front and rear wheels.


636
00:49:34.915 --> 00:49:37.915
These are custom rims.
But not for skidding, of course.


637
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:39.327
Of course.

638
00:49:39.328 --> 00:49:42.090
We increased the monitoring system,
The cooling system...


639
00:49:42.091 --> 00:49:44.430
...and we did more beautiful.
- Great!


640
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:47.090
We put new watches,
and pedals.


641
00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:50.530
That red button panel,
punish anything on the route.


642
00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:55.990
Sliding Doors.
They are useless, but pretty.


643
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.390
I thought you liked.
If, like me.


644
00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.340
I want the car to stay here.

645
00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:01.990
We pay rent.

646
00:50:01.991 --> 00:50:03.190
It's your money.

647
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.320
Speaking of desires, your account.

648
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:19.790
Everything is installed here.

649
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.510
Not spending enough
to cover the debt.


650
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.190
- It is a fair price.
- We want to save the workshop.


651
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.690
I can write a check now,
that will solve all your problems.


652
00:50:33.056 --> 00:50:35.390
Only change a debt for another.

653
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:37.190
I do not want
to be indebted to you.

654
00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:46.190
That would be enough,
Life would be easier.


655
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:01.360
- There are 5 minutes!
- What are you doing here?


656
00:51:01.361 --> 00:51:04.670
- Costume who ordered pizza.
- Do not asked any pizza!


657
00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:07.790
I did. I'm hungry.
And I'm ready for my lesson.


658
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:09.090
What drive?

659
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.510
My new car racing!

660
00:51:14.612 --> 00:51:15.930
Not bad.

661
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:19.190
I work with this.

662
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:23.390
First rule of racing.

663
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:26.190
Never look back,
because behind you, never mind.


664
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:28.270
Where do we go?

665
00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.721
Where we can accelerate.

666
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:35.975
Well.

667
00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:37.890
Arranquémos this baby.

668
00:51:44.503 --> 00:51:46.060
Enjoy your lunch.

669
00:52:46.061 --> 00:52:47.720
It's all in the control
of speed.


670
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:49.791
Brakes and driving.

671
00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.230
What happens if I press this?

672
00:53:00.966 --> 00:53:01.966
Register.

673
00:53:12.537 --> 00:53:15.230
The speed will put you ahead.
But not win the race.


674
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:18.070
Driving and psychology.

675
00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:33.830
Care for the drawings, Get inside,
and pressed to move your opponent.


676
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.364
O... bloquéalo, before you go.

677
00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:47.490
Now it's your turn.

678
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.690
He made some
investigations, sir.


679
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:57.161
- I did not know that.
- Now we know.


680
00:53:59.215 --> 00:54:03.120
This... is the place where Stan
moving your money laundering.


681
00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:05.180
How do you know that?

682
00:54:05.181 --> 00:54:07.475
Every day arrive
with heavy bags...


683
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:11.132
...when to go, 20 minutes later,
pockets are empty.


684
00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.690
That does not mean that the
bags have money.


685
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.990
Perhaps they are selling merchandise.

686
00:54:15.991 --> 00:54:18.220
Then... Why is this
rate monitor?


687
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.590
It is the driver we are pursuing.

688
00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:27.101
What makes watching this place?

689
00:54:27.102 --> 00:54:30.900
Five trucks, which by chance
I saw parked outside the coffee...


690
00:54:30.902 --> 00:54:32.100
...the day of the robbery.

691
00:54:34.354 --> 00:54:37.043
Do we really write down the plates...

692
00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:39.370
...of the cars we saw in
the crime scene?


693
00:54:40.254 --> 00:54:42.623
I am a detective. That we do.

694
00:54:43.205 --> 00:54:47.990
I saw the same vehicle?
where are the offices.


695
00:54:47.991 --> 00:54:50.890
I think it prepares Gargolov
to take another blow.


696
00:54:51.705 --> 00:54:54.990
If so, we may be
wait.


697
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:58.510
Arrest everyone,
remove this tumor once.


698
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.490
That was thinking, sir.

699
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.190
Let me see this.

700
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:06.990
If you've got something, get a
permission to organize everything.


701
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:09.132
Much earlier.

702
00:55:09.252 --> 00:55:11.540
I would like to be part of
this team, sir.


703
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.440
See what I can do.

704
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.135
That's not all...

705
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:22.914
You visit.

706
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:28.790
Excuse me, sir.

707
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.660
What are you doing here?

708
00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:36.620
Does not appear,
not answer your phone...


709
00:55:36.621 --> 00:55:37.840
...so here I am.

710
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:50.915
What do you want?

711
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:54.450
Dart this.

712
00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.113
Do not blame for losing
career, Eric.


713
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.790
Then there must be another reason,
so you can take to another.


714
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:05.190
Give him the keys.

715
00:56:06.623 --> 00:56:08.690
Warner is not a broker,
is a banker.


716
00:56:08.691 --> 00:56:11.960
I do not give you an extension
Payment by a fuck.


717
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.950
It seems that we will not give.

718
00:56:22.232 --> 00:56:24.870
- Are you following Mike?
- It's my job.


719
00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:29.975
I think it's a fugitive.
If so, what arrests.


720
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:32.340
You can not!

721
00:56:32.341 --> 00:56:33.967
Why would not it?

722
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.480
- What love?
- Whether that what I lost.


723
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.080
- He spoke of careers.
- I know that I speak.


724
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.430
I never said I loved you, Eric.

725
00:56:44.431 --> 00:56:46.040
Never said no.

726
00:56:46.377 --> 00:56:49.051
I can not get involved
emotionally with brokers.


727
00:56:49.052 --> 00:56:52.770
- But if another.
- Another who die on the expiry.


728
00:56:52.771 --> 00:56:55.975
Another, which is worse than me.

729
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.822
I do not want
to get you started, Eric.

730
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.690
I want it back.

731
00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:07.475
How can bet your car?
Is Selling your life?


732
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.790
It's the way it always has been.

733
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:18.790
I do not believe that.

734
00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:21.790
Cree that what you want,
but you need to run...


735
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:23.510
...and do not have a car.

736
00:57:24.516 --> 00:57:26.590
I have one for you.

737
00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.790
Evidence... test again.
Try again.


738
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:47.190
Accelerate.

739
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:49.560
Sharp inside.

740
00:58:52.956 --> 00:58:53.970
Turn right.

741
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:58.660
That's right! That's right!

742
00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:06.890
Release the accelerator, lessens,
aprienta and clutch.


743
00:59:08.275 --> 00:59:09.772
Make the turn.

744
00:59:30.173 --> 00:59:31.410
What did I do?

745
00:59:31.411 --> 00:59:32.710
Your first skidding.

746
00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:34.130
How do you feel?

747
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:41.190
You tell me.

748
00:59:42.432 --> 00:59:44.690
Tighten the accelerator. Drop them.
Use the clutch.


749
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.120
- I love my husband.
- I do not care.


750
00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.240
Well!

751
01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:40.730
Eric... We are ready.

752
01:00:40.731 --> 01:00:44.723
We started surveillance 24 hours.
Are you in?


753
01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.390
Absolutely, sir.

754
01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:03.920
Ready.

755
01:01:03.921 --> 01:01:05.920
All statistics
are perfect.


756
01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:08.041
It's great.

757
01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:10.410
Think about how to fix the BMW
by Mrs Deveraux.


758
01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:12.110
Does Brom?

759
01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:14.467
Do not spend with that,
see this car in action.


760
01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.690
There we go, we have no driver.

761
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:25.090
What's Eric?

762
01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.590
If it were to
come, would already be here.

763
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:32.840
We can not miss,
We have only one day.


764
01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.690
That's why I will
selling the car tomorrow.


765
01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.490
Can I at least give a
back to the block?


766
01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.090
Da 2 laps, not only as Ray.

767
01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:12.590
Which of these is yours?
The above.


768
01:02:14.274 --> 01:02:16.133
I imagined that was that.

769
01:02:17.107 --> 01:02:18.390
I would like to see it.

770
01:02:20.105 --> 01:02:22.034
Can have,
but you can not have that.


771
01:02:22.035 --> 01:02:24.656
I do not want to move you,
just see how you live.


772
01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:28.250
We know! But that part
My life belongs to Gustav.


773
01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:31.830
You have fear that I see.

774
01:02:32.107 --> 01:02:34.630
- We are in the car.
- He knows my needs.


775
01:02:35.157 --> 01:02:36.890
So why not worry?

776
01:02:36.891 --> 01:02:38.690
Doing so. On his way.

777
01:02:38.691 --> 01:02:42.046
I do leave my life,
and makes no questions.


778
01:02:42.047 --> 01:02:43.047
No?

779
01:02:43.048 --> 01:02:45.640
None of the expected 2
the other is faithful.


780
01:02:45.641 --> 01:02:47.630
As we continue loving.

781
01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:51.490
We are united, but we are free.

782
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:54.980
What about the money
Spending in this car?


783
01:02:54.981 --> 01:02:58.242
He is not interested, I can spend
what they give me in anything.


784
01:02:58.243 --> 01:03:00.213
No question about my bills!

785
01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:03.330
What? You can give me 100 thousand
U.S. dollars, and say that the loss.


786
01:03:05.362 --> 01:03:08.690
It was supposed to spend the money,
on things that make me happy to me.


787
01:03:08.691 --> 01:03:10.990
Do not you would
give me 100 big happy?

788
01:03:10.991 --> 01:03:12.850
In reality you want to buy?

789
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:14.840
Would you feel happy
being my property?


790
01:03:14.841 --> 01:03:16.870
- It would not be so!
- How do you know?


791
01:03:16.871 --> 01:03:19.530
Because... Gustav you bought,
and yet you're happy!


792
01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.830
Sorry. It was stupid
what I said.


793
01:03:30.034 --> 01:03:32.640
Mike, if you have a problem
with this, dilo now.


794
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.550
I do not.
Honestly.


795
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:41.580
Well. I need you to understand
something about myself.


796
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:45.155
My life is...
very safe.


797
01:03:45.523 --> 01:03:46.890
Very safe.

798
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:49.931
All dangers disappeared,
and I need that danger back...


799
01:03:49.932 --> 01:03:52.437
...to feel my heart beating,
how if it were to explode.


800
01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:55.560
To be part of something,
apart from this marriage.


801
01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.950
And I think what I found.

802
01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:02.190
But they never leave,
by anyone, not for nothing.


803
01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.080
I do not want to ask that.

804
01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:09.960
An intelligent man.

805
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:45.210
Rainer took the Ford,
and not yet returned.


806
01:04:45.211 --> 01:04:47.290
Is not that what you said
Venda, is not it?


807
01:04:47.635 --> 01:04:48.635
If.

808
01:04:48.902 --> 01:04:49.902
Damn!

809
01:04:49.903 --> 01:04:51.390
So is running with it!

810
01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:54.067
Hey, I can arrive quickly, but
I only have room for one.


811
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:55.860
I those achieved!

812
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:16.830
Oh, God!

813
01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:22.280
Rainer...
Oh my God!


814
01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:29.344
Levántenlo!

815
01:05:29.345 --> 01:05:30.790
Assortment to bring my car!

816
01:05:32.268 --> 01:05:33.790
Everything will be fine.

817
01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:40.680
Be careful with him.

818
01:05:41.781 --> 01:05:43.790
Everything will be fine.
I will go right behind you.


819
01:06:00.033 --> 01:06:01.033
Go.

820
01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.740
Will Listen?
Verifying.


821
01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.950
<i>Station 1, Cloudy.</i>

822
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:30.290
<i>Station 3, Cloudy.</i>

823
01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:33.940
Station 4, Cloudy.

824
01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:40.560
Do you know how lucky you have to stop
come with me to a novice how you?


825
01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:43.380
- I am very grateful.
- Learn a lot too.


826
01:06:43.381 --> 01:06:48.560
Starting with the introduction, at 2
most important objects of surveillance.


827
01:06:48.561 --> 01:06:49.990
What is that?

828
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:52.590
A urine bag.
What goes in, must leave.


829
01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:55.030
It would be great to have a
movies as well.


830
01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:01.834
Hello.

831
01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.530
What hospital?

832
01:07:07.665 --> 01:07:09.330
Now I go out there.

833
01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:13.190
I have to leave.

834
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.740
In the midst of a vigilance?

835
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:18.690
It's a family emergency.
'll Be back at how you can.


836
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.131
I'm here.
How are you?


837
01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:35.160
The magic, and that is what
mattered.


838
01:07:35.161 --> 01:07:36.161
Watch...

839
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.590
The doctor said I had to
tell the police.


840
01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:41.400
Which means, that will ask questions,
we do not want to answer.


841
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.870
I say that I am a doctor police.
What do you think that?


842
01:07:46.077 --> 01:07:47.077
Thank you.

843
01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:48.990
What else can I do?

844
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.620
It's my fault, if it had appeared...

845
01:07:51.621 --> 01:07:53.940
You and Katie were made
for each other.


846
01:07:53.941 --> 01:07:56.514
I do not want you to take the
responsibility for everything.


847
01:07:56.515 --> 01:08:01.290
Believe it or not, people do
stupid things for themselves.


848
01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:04.310
I recall that.

849
01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:05.630
I hope so.

850
01:08:05.631 --> 01:08:08.590
Why you're tempted,
to do something stupid now.


851
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:29.950
- What makes him here?
- Mike who was brought to Rainer.


852
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:32.790
Would you're couching it as well?

853
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.816
What do you think they do?
Will begin a fight here?


854
01:08:39.817 --> 01:08:42.890
It's just what I need now!
Grow!


855
01:08:45.476 --> 01:08:47.200
Where are the parents of the boy?

856
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:51.881
His mother is in Canada. Soy
her cousin, and I am responsible for it.


857
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.890
You can see it,
but only for a minute.

858
01:08:54.891 --> 01:08:57.290
We are about to take him to surgery.

859
01:09:19.112 --> 01:09:21.237
What were you thinking?

860
01:09:24.355 --> 01:09:27.310
Never drove a car so powerful.

861
01:09:30.047 --> 01:09:33.090
I thought it would be easy...

862
01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.226
I was so wrong!

863
01:09:39.332 --> 01:09:41.650
We do not have to do it.

864
01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:47.810
Someone has to do,
or it will lose everything.


865
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:51.330
It's just a workshop.

866
01:09:58.405 --> 01:10:00.570
It is so difficult!

867
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:12.890
We are ready to carry them.

868
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:36.620
Please stay with me.

869
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:40.360
I can not.

870
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.490
Only for a while.

871
01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:48.590
I have to go.

872
01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.190
I do not go anywhere.

873
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.380
What will.

874
01:11:06.381 --> 01:11:09.600
You have wasted half
your life with me.


875
01:11:41.501 --> 01:11:43.280
I want to see what he has.

876
01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.840
Leave go, please.

877
01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.750
He took a Hand
a boy tonight.


878
01:12:19.791 --> 01:12:21.940
So tonight boy
became a man.


879
01:12:21.941 --> 01:12:23.390
A crippled man!

880
01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:25.591
All men have scars.

881
01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:27.305
And your friend learned by himself...

882
01:12:27.306 --> 01:12:30.590
...who never let an opponent,
able to buscarte.


883
01:12:31.190 --> 01:12:34.640
In Kiev, there are many men with
a hand through me.


884
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:38.201
It is good advice, Mr Gargolov.

885
01:12:38.202 --> 01:12:41.590
Why not give me the axe?, And you
I teach the same lesson this imbecile.


886
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:44.930
It would, but...
is the nephew of my wife.


887
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.125
What luck that you are!

888
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.234
The fate of is him.

889
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:03.235
I like you. Mike.

890
01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:06.090
Well, I'm not really
a fan to you now!


891
01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:09.502
Perhaps this will
change your way of thinking.


892
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:16.550
Your car is finished,
and ready to run.


893
01:13:32.154 --> 01:13:33.610
I do not think so.

894
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:35.890
Do not like the car?

895
01:13:35.891 --> 01:13:37.790
I do not like people who
works for you.


896
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:40.323
Because you remember who you are.

897
01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.850
Has someone how I looked,
since your mother died.


898
01:13:43.851 --> 01:13:45.610
Since you left.

899
01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:48.390
It is the only way to live,
when you get what you want.


900
01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.075
Yes, but I need to change.

901
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:59.090
You have expensive tastes...
in cars, women.


902
01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:03.590
How long do you think that your girlfriend
rich soon get bored of you?


903
01:14:05.336 --> 01:14:07.690
There are still a lot of women,
who like things cheap and dirty.


904
01:14:07.691 --> 01:14:08.990
Thank God for that!

905
01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:10.740
Then...

906
01:14:11.912 --> 01:14:15.030
Just back to distribute...
pizza?


907
01:14:15.345 --> 01:14:17.440
In this cute scooter you have?

908
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:19.190
That's the plan.

909
01:14:19.191 --> 01:14:22.380
Who want to deceive, Mike?
You will not rich in that way.


910
01:14:22.381 --> 01:14:23.920
Do not go to prison either.

911
01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:27.140
This is a breakthrough.

912
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:31.240
Buy some clothes, and
get a phone number.


913
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:32.690
Corrado for me.

914
01:14:32.691 --> 01:14:36.202
And as payment for the privilege,
you get some work exhaust.


915
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:42.790
If you get my pocket money...

916
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:46.490
I feel deeply...
insulted.


917
01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:52.870
It's the last thing I would do.

918
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.265
So it should be.

919
01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:02.650
Tomorrow, you will lead to Markus
pick up some documents for me.


920
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:05.590
Need to bring it back fast.

921
01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:07.590
I am confident that you will either.

922
01:15:18.923 --> 01:15:20.530
Need to make Mead morning?

923
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:22.250
No. Thank you.

924
01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:24.790
Well, this thing is nearly full.

925
01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:26.400
I'm going to empty it.

926
01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:29.070
Stay vigilant while going.

927
01:15:29.371 --> 01:15:30.371
I'll do.

928
01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:00.790
Prepare all, we visit.

929
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.390
Keep the engine running.

930
01:16:14.391 --> 01:16:16.190
This does not take much time.

931
01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:41.907
All units,
maintain their position.


932
01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.907
Nobody moves until
return to take the car.


933
01:16:58.840 --> 01:16:59.840
Shit!

934
01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:08.590
Shit! Shit!

935
01:17:16.290 --> 01:17:17.490
Arms lists.

936
01:17:30.325 --> 01:17:31.870
We are exposed!

937
01:17:38.522 --> 01:17:40.143
All units come into action!

938
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:17.290
See you, friend!

939
01:19:23.765 --> 01:19:27.520
Rainer surgery went very well,
is now recovering.


940
01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.074
Does that mean that you can
use your hand?


941
01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:33.180
It will take months...

942
01:19:33.181 --> 01:19:36.930
...before we know how much
sensitivity and mobility won, but...


943
01:19:37.301 --> 01:19:40.677
...do not have that,
anything can happen.


944
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:44.790
I appreciate what he did, doctor.
Thank you.


945
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:47.490
Go home and rest a bit.

946
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:54.215
Let the Ford,
and llevemóslo the workshop. How well?


947
01:19:54.655 --> 01:19:57.155
I stay here, and I hope
Eric to return.


948
01:19:57.156 --> 01:19:58.690
And then return to the workshop.

949
01:19:59.103 --> 01:20:01.542
We need to pack,
before the bank comes tomorrow.


950
01:20:05.244 --> 01:20:06.790
See you later.

951
01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:46.133
You are arrested.

952
01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.930
I do not think so.

953
01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:51.180
I saw you took part
in the theft today.


954
01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:53.790
And I am sure, that is not the only
crime he has committed.


955
01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:55.470
Probably not.

956
01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:58.060
But how explanations
I recognize?


957
01:20:58.061 --> 01:21:00.100
I was reading your
American record.


958
01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:02.650
And why Mir that?

959
01:21:02.651 --> 01:21:05.055
I will say that you saw between the
Gargolov people.


960
01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:08.890
And what of you were to Gargolov,
because follow Wolf.


961
01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.590
Who know, for careers
those involved in illegal.


962
01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:14.830
Try it.

963
01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.070
I do not have to do,
I am not a policeman.


964
01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:19.760
The only thing I do
is tell your boss.


965
01:21:19.761 --> 01:21:20.961
And the damage will be done.

966
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:24.190
Are you threatening me?

967
01:21:24.191 --> 01:21:26.990
You are who aims a weapon
a man disarmed!


968
01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.290
Takes you inside.

969
01:21:32.975 --> 01:21:34.890
That can wait for
after the race.


970
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:38.990
What career?

971
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:43.490
The you are going to win today,
and Katie does not lose the workshop.


972
01:21:50.710 --> 01:21:52.090
Why did you do?

973
01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.990
Because you've seen run.

974
01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.190
I can not win this race.

975
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:01.390
You can.

976
01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:05.930
I still will be here tomorrow...

977
01:22:05.931 --> 01:22:07.791
Katie... but will no longer be the workshop.

978
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:17.590
This does not change anything between us.

979
01:22:17.591 --> 01:22:18.791
In this case you're right.

980
01:22:31.157 --> 01:22:32.465
Sweet!

981
01:22:33.274 --> 01:22:35.100
You do not need something sweeter.

982
01:22:38.814 --> 01:22:40.790
Made with customized parts...

983
01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.710
...haganme an offer.

984
01:22:43.354 --> 01:22:44.790
This is for today.

985
01:22:45.506 --> 01:22:47.310
Anything!

986
01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:05.890
I hope you brought the axe.

987
01:23:05.891 --> 01:23:08.490
If, and cut your balls
after he wins the race.


988
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:10.890
You need new balls,
because they lost yours.


989
01:23:16.203 --> 01:23:17.915
Leave it to the race!

990
01:23:20.147 --> 01:23:22.330
Can we be ready in 5 minutes?

991
01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:24.625
Let me give a return
to block first.


992
01:23:24.915 --> 01:23:25.915
Well.

993
01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.490
Try not to scratch the paintings.

994
01:24:17.134 --> 01:24:19.390
- This is how you run?
- This is how I win.


995
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:07.210
Yes!

996
01:25:28.214 --> 01:25:30.790
- Do you want me to lead?
- I have everything under control!


997
01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:38.065
That what I see!

998
01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:44.801
So how is leading in Tennessee?

999
01:26:44.877 --> 01:26:46.690
It hit me too.

1000
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:43.390
Te strange, dear.

1001
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.233
I, too, dear.

1002
01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:51.010
Are You were good?
While Will was away?


1003
01:27:51.011 --> 01:27:52.011
Hell, no!

1004
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:26.290
This is free today.

1005
01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.290
A pizza?

1006
01:28:31.097 --> 01:28:32.490
Have morrones extra.

1007
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.912
Those are too many morrones!

1008
01:28:45.846 --> 01:28:47.690
What do you expect in return?

1009
01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:51.160
Keep the workshop open,
sends to the bank to hell...


1010
01:28:51.161 --> 01:28:53.390
...and build more cars race.

1011
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:55.890
Is that all?

1012
01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.790
Perhaps let me drive one,
ever.


1013
01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.355
We'll see.

1014
01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.920
We were you, and to my left
men back, Mike.


1015
01:29:58.198 --> 01:29:59.790
That was not very fair.

1016
01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:03.540
My only loyalty is to myself.

1017
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:05.840
Some call it cowardice.

1018
01:30:05.841 --> 01:30:07.440
I call it survival.

1019
01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:26.390
Like my car wreck.

1020
01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:30.930
Wolf and I ran.

1021
01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:34.110
He lost more than his hand.

1022
01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.320
Are not you going to shoot me why?

1023
01:30:40.305 --> 01:30:41.790
What I am thinking.

1024
01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:44.790
The misfortunes occur.

1025
01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:48.690
That's good. Moreover,
Stake for you in the race.


1026
01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:51.985
I won enough to buy
Wolf to a nice coffin...


1027
01:30:51.986 --> 01:30:53.512
...and is a lot of money.

1028
01:30:56.890 --> 01:31:00.300
I am pleased, Mr Gargolov,
because this concludes our treatment.


1029
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:03.730
We no longer work for you.

1030
01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:06.590
You are an excellent driver.

1031
01:31:06.591 --> 01:31:08.670
Thank you, I can
no driver.


1032
01:31:08.671 --> 01:31:10.660
Do you think you let go?

1033
01:31:12.955 --> 01:31:14.660
We finished in any forms.

1034
01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.005
What all places
could have ido, Mike...


1035
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:35.190
...because they came to Germany?

1036
01:31:36.935 --> 01:31:38.590
I like beer and sausages.

1037
01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.790
See you soon, Mike.

1038
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:11.550
<i>Someday, you and I'll go to
a ride in this car again...</i>


1039
01:32:11.551 --> 01:32:13.764
<i>...nothing in front of ours,
other than the route.</i>


1040
01:32:13.765 --> 01:32:15.240
<i>I can not wait, daddy.</i>

1041
01:32:15.241 --> 01:32:20.914
<i>do not have to do, everything that
have to do is close our eyes.</i>


1042
01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.210
Are you going in my direction?

1043
01:32:38.425 --> 01:32:39.790
Probably.

1044
01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:41.790
Sube, and we'll see.

1045
01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:52.490
Thank you for what you did yesterday.

1046
01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.600
Not to talk about.

1047
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:58.690
Do not deny, I know what you were
you who saved my workshop.


1048
01:32:59.867 --> 01:33:01.790
The way that driving is unique.

1049
01:33:01.791 --> 01:33:03.790
- Except as you...
- Cogan.


1050
01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:06.510
I was going to say "making love".

1051
01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:09.510
There is a difference. Do you know?

1052
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:12.223
Really?

1053
01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:19.820
How can I bring?

1054
01:33:19.821 --> 01:33:22.630
- No!
- Sure, rises!


1055
01:33:25.934 --> 01:33:28.130
If pizza strips in this car,
kill you.


1056
01:33:34.678 --> 01:33:36.111
Is there any room for another?

1057
01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:41.240
Not to pick up your kind, but...

1058
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:43.850
...in this case, 
I will make an exception.

1059
01:33:54.032 --> 01:33:56.890
Do not go too fast,
or you put a fine.


1060
01:33:57.690 --> 01:33:59.790
Pressure is what
makes life fun.


1061
01:34:00.665 --> 01:34:02.343
You should try it sometime.

1062
01:34:03.855 --> 01:34:04.950
Where do we go?

1063
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:08.690
I do not know. But I am glad
you come.


1064
01:34:08.691 --> 01:34:10.490
I, too, pizza man.

1065
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:14.990
Are you sure where to go?

1066
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:18.110
What I am.
