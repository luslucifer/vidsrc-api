1
00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.325
Oh, this
is a nice house, huh?


2
00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:35.119
- Hi!
- Is that the daughter?


3
00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:36.996
Where shall we park?

4
00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.998
- Uh, right here? I don't know.
- Right here?


5
00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:40.791
- Hi.
- I'm Sarah.


6
00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.584
- Sarah, hi. I'm Mia.
- Hi, Sarah.


7
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.378
You spoke to me
on the phone earlier.


8
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.213
- I'll just give you a hug.
- Hi.


9
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.090
- I'm glad you're here. Hi.
- Gavin.


10
00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:49.967
- This is Gavin and Luis.
- What's up?


11
00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:52.970
Do I look OK?
I gotta be all...tucked in.


12
00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:55.472
- You look great.
- Sorry.


13
00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.100
I was gonna ask, do you
want me a certain way or...


14
00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:01.353
Um, no. Just...just be yourself.
Almost, like, ignore these guys.


15
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.230
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


16
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.982
- They're invisible.
- Yeah, that'll be easy!


17
00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.859
- Ignore.
- Wow!


18
00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:10.321
Ma can come off kind of salty,
but it's all an act.


19
00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.197
- OK.
- She's excited you're here.


20
00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.074
She's been cleaning and dusting

21
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.201
like the president's
coming to dinner or something.


22
00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:19.163
Ma?

23
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.165
Well, she was back here.

24
00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:23.834
You have the grant money, right?
It said so on the flyers.


25
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.627
- Yes.
- That's what we're counting on.


26
00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.504
No, no, definitely.
It's part of the deal.


27
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.298
Roanoke will also
help underwrite


28
00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.091
some of the healthcare costs
as well.


29
00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:32.968
Oh, wow. I love Roanoke.

30
00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:35.929
Yeah, it...it has to be
the right fit, though.


31
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:36.972
Of course.

32
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.849
- Please and thank you.
- OK.


33
00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:40.726
Kiss her ass.

34
00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:42.936
- Smile.
- Point noted.


35
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.356
I mean, I'm sorry.
You know all this.


36
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.067
- Hey, Ma!
- Yes, you did.


37
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.943
- Hello there!
- Oh, Harris is with her.


38
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.820
- Hi. Oh, gosh.
- Oh, yeah.


39
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:53.906
- Those people are here.
- Hey, Sarah.


40
00:01:54.073 --> 00:01:56.075
- The crew I told you about.
- Nice to meet you.


41
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.660
They're here for the pre-interview.
Remember, Ma?


42
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.537
They wanna make
a movie about me!


43
00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.247
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, hopefully.


44
00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:04.833
- What do you think of that?
- I think it's a good idea.


45
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.960
You do? Well, we'll see.

46
00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.630
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm being
a bad hostess, aren't I?


47
00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:12.174
- Here. You take that.
- Do you need...


48
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.426
I'm just gonna take this
and put this stuff away


49
00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:17.721
so that I have it
where it belongs for next time.


50
00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.807
Of course.

51
00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:23.685
What is of interest is that
this is of an educational nature.


52
00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.854
That interests me.

53
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.815
Um...

54
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.109
I'm not interested
in being exploited.


55
00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.819
Oh...

56
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.737
I'm not the butt
of anyone's joke.


57
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:35.614
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, Mom.


58
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:38.534
Mrs. Logan, that is definitely
not why we'd be here.


59
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.453
You know, actually
my grandfather had the disease


60
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.206
so it's not just a grade for me.

61
00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.377
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.


62
00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:50.421
Well...

63
00:02:51.547 --> 00:02:55.217
..I am a very private person...

64
00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:58.262
..and, um...

65
00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.556
..I'm just having
second thoughts.


66
00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.725
I think that you would be better off
with someone else.


67
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.770
I'm sorry. I know
you've driven a long way.


68
00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:11.900
But I don't think
I'm the candidate for you, so...


69
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.028
Mom?

70
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.947
What the fuck was that
about your grandfather?


71
00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:19.324
I thought they were on vacation
in New Zealand.


72
00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.493
She just needed
a little nudging.


73
00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.389
I thought you said
these people were broke.


74
00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.517
She's behind on the house,
but she won't sell,


75
00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.645
so Sarah's in a tough spot.

76
00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:17.216
Guys, I want you to be
on good behaviour, OK?


77
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.092
'Cause she's, like,
a proper old lady.


78
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.221
So I don't wanna be,
like, hounding them.


79
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.181
- Hey!
- Hi.


80
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:25.724
- Hi.
- Hi, Sarah.


81
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.976
- How's it going?
- I'm so glad you're here.


82
00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.187
Hello, hello. Welcome.

83
00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:33.941
I didn't know you guys were
gonna come in, like, right away.


84
00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.985
- Right, I know.
- We wanna capture it all, so...


85
00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:38.862
I paint in here mostly now

86
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.948
because, you know,
we don't entertain.


87
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.951
- She's an amazing artist.
- No, it's just a hobby.


88
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.912
- I'm not an amazing artist.
- You're prolific. There's a lot.


89
00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:49.706
Oh, I used to know
the name of this bird.


90
00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.750
Looks like
a blue-tailed finch, actually.


91
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.920
- Does it? Do you know birds?
- Oh, oh, dude, no.


92
00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:57.089
Well, maybe that is what it is.
I don't remember.


93
00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.007
Oh, is this Bavarian crystal?

94
00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.718
It's better... Yeah,
it's probably better not to...


95
00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.471
Yeah, we won't be touching
the old things.


96
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:07.391
You're a curious guy, huh?
You wanna touch everything?


97
00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:09.309
Do you guys have
a Starbucks in town?


98
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.186
Oh, no, no.

99
00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.480
This is Sarah's room.
You can just take a look.


100
00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:17.234
This was her room as a child.
She loved cars.


101
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:20.571
We haven't touched anything
since she was a child.


102
00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.698
I kinda like
leaving it like this.


103
00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.449
She was a big ball player.

104
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.326
I was never really
allowed in here.


105
00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.245
I guess you found your room.

106
00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:30.497
- Oh, this is us?
- There's a blow-up mattress.


107
00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.041
- I'm sorry, this is a little...
- Yeah, this'll blow up.


108
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.918
..a little more minimal,
a little rustic.


109
00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.628
Say thank you to her.
Thank you.


110
00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.505
- Oh, no, it's, uh...
- Say thank you.


111
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.591
- Thank you.
- No, you have a different room.


112
00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.427
- Oh, I didn't know.
- There's no intermingling here.


113
00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:45.971
Boys, stay there.
And the door's closed.


114
00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:47.014
- Deborah?
- Yes?


115
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.308
Thank you for your,
um...hospitality.


116
00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.310
- Appreciate it.
- We're gonna have fun.


117
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.061
- Right?
- Yeah, man.


118
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.605
OK, good.

119
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.357
- My Aunt Edna's, um...
- This is amazing.


120
00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.360
Um... What's this...
Bedroom set!


121
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.654
- Careful with that, sweetheart.
- I know.


122
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.740
Yeah, there.
That one's supposed to be there.


123
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.366
Were you ever in Germany?

124
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.076
No, I have not.

125
00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:11.580
- Always been a regret of mine.
- Mom, you went to Germany.


126
00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:13.248
Remember?

127
00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:16.418
- Well, that must, um...
- Remember?


128
00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.754
Oh, must've been
a long time ago.


129
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.883
Well, but you were there.
You loved it. Remember?


130
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.511
The story of Alzheimer's
is never about one person.


131
00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:30.432
My PhD thesis film posits
that this insidious disease


132
00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.517
not only destroys the patient,

133
00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.394
but has
a physiological influence


134
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.271
on the primary caregiver.

135
00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:39.566
<i>Alzheimer's occurs when</i>
<i>abnormal protein fragments</i>


136
00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.569
<i>accumulate in the hippocampus,</i>
<i>killing neurons.</i>


137
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.656
<i>The disease then creeps towards</i>
<i>the front of the brain,</i>


138
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.699
<i>wiping out neurons responsible</i>
<i>for logical thought</i>


139
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.576
<i>and problem solving.</i>

140
00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.662
<i>It then assaults</i>
<i>the sensory region,</i>


141
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.955
<i>sparking terrifying hallucinations.</i>

142
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:58.543
<i>Eventually, it erases a person's</i>
<i>oldest and most precious memories.</i>


143
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.005
<i>In end stage, Alzheimer's</i>
<i>destroys the part of the brain</i>


144
00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.049
<i>that regulates the heart</i>
<i>and breathing.</i>


145
00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:07.678
<i>When swallowing goes,</i>
<i>death is not far behind.</i>


146
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.430
- Take this one off.
- Huh?


147
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.933
- Well, it's so military.
- What do you think?


148
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.018
Let's just... Yeah.

149
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.354
Wouldn't you agree?
I mean, you always look so pretty.


150
00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:19.272
Whatever. OK, fine. Yep.

151
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.982
- Thank you. That's great.
- Gone.


152
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.651
- Happy?
- I am happy.


153
00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:24.528
Awesome.

154
00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:26.530
Is that
a shirt of your dad's?


155
00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:29.658
I guess I would have,
you know, a senior moment.


156
00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:32.744
Sure, you know, I'd put the toast in
and it would pop up


157
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:36.289
and I'd put the...push it
back down again or something.


158
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.166
Toast it twice. Big deal.

159
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.585
On several occasions,
she left the stove on.


160
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.004
OK? Burnt up the spice rack,
the whole wall.


161
00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.631
If you remember
your grandmother,


162
00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.258
she was frightening.

163
00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:48.343
She would leave a pot
on the stove


164
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.971
until it melted right down
to the little glass top.


165
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.014
- Maybe it's genetic.
- So that was a clue.


166
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.891
I'm just saying what was a clue.

167
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.477
Mia asked what's a clue for me,
and that was a clue.


168
00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.980
Alright. That was a clue.

169
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.232
Deborah was exhibiting
what we call MCI


170
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.025
mild cognitive impairment.

171
00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.944
Through a battery of tests,

172
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.447
we were able to diagnose
with 95% certainty


173
00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:11.450
that she was in the early stages
of Alzheimer's.


174
00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.453
How did she take the news?

175
00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:16.830
It's devastating,
obviously, for anyone,


176
00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:20.667
but Deborah's not someone
to go down without a fight.


177
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.462
<i>After the premature death</i>
<i>of her husband, Dennis,</i>


178
00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.338
<i>to a pulmonary embolism,</i>

179
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.215
<i>Deborah was forced to provide</i>
<i>for 2-year-old Sarah</i>


180
00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.092
<i>on her own.</i>

181
00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:32.220
<i>She leveraged their house</i>
<i>as collateral and would go on</i>


182
00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.347

183

<i>for the town of Exuma.</i>

184
00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.059
That was the way
that professionals


185
00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.603
received their messages

186
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.981
and, I guess, transferred information
back in those days,


187
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:44.858
was through
a professional answering service.


188
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.068
Everyone told her
she was crazy at the time.


189
00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.612
- Right?
- They certainly did.


190
00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:50.280
I was all alone
with a small child.


191
00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.282
You can't tell Mom
not to do something


192
00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:54.409
'cause then she will absolutely
make sure she does it.


193
00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.495
- I was the nexus of this town.
- Yeah!


194
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.581
Doctors, lawyers,
and Town Hall, everybody.


195
00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:03.168
Three-Martini lunches
and affairs


196
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:06.004
and philanderers
and alcoholics and...


197
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.381
I had to cover
for all of these people.


198
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.425
You didn't have to.
You chose to.


199
00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.594
Well, I did or they wouldn't
have stayed with me.


200
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.137
- True.
- I wouldn't have had a business.


201
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:15.847
You know.

202
00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:21.102
<i>As the days pass,</i>
<i>what becomes most apparent</i>


203
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:23.980
<i>is there are no small tasks</i>
<i>for an Alzheimer's patient.</i>


204
00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.359
- $27.96.
- 27?


205
00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:29.236
Let me see. Alright...

206
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.072
OK, there's some of the change.

207
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.199
- OK.
- I just need the dollars.


208
00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:36.076
Oh, right, OK.

209
00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:38.328
<i>Maintenance of daily living</i>
<i>exacts a great toll</i>


210
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.623
<i>as organisational thinking</i>
<i>is compromised.</i>


211
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.500
It didn't cook it
all the way through.


212
00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.585
I'm just gonna put this here
like this.


213
00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.004
- Why, thank you.
- Does it taste alright?


214
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:51.049
- Is it sweet enough?
- Yeah, that is good.


215
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.926
Can you taste the vanilla in it?

216
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.095
- That's my secret.
- She's a fighter.


217
00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:58.640
And she's brave.
She's generous and kind.


218
00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.351
But how do you fight your way
through something you...


219
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.854
..you can't see or know?

220
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.440
I do all my little puzzles.
I do crosswords.


221
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.359
I'm lifting weights.

222
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:13.071
I am doing everything
that I have read will help


223
00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.574
to stave off the progression
of this disease.


224
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.117
Stave it off!

225
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:19.077
There's no cure.

226
00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.997
And so when I am
in the middle of something


227
00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:26.543
and suddenly my mind
just leaves the premises,


228
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.881
there are no words to describe
how distressing it is.


229
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.059
Debbie in the garden.

230
00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.562
Zoom in.

231
00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.648
Slow push.

232
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.151
What is she...

233
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.738
Luis, you're supposed to be
working on the edit!


234
00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:56.865
- Why are you screwing around?
- I was just shooting some...


235
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.742
I'm hungry.

236
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:01.036
- You hungry?
- Um...


237
00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.829
Let's get some lunch.

238
00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.750
Mia, lunch?

239
00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.792
Am I supposed to not talk?
Should I hold my breath?


240
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.379
It doesn't matter, anyway,

241
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.798
because, wow,
your blood pressure...


242
00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:56.883
- I mean...
- What?


243
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.594
You know stress is
the real killer, right?


244
00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.596
Don't worry.

245
00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.891
I plan on dying of cirrhosis
of the liver, anyway, OK?


246
00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.851
- Right?
- Well...


247
00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:08.603
- Uh-huh?
- However you wanna go.


248
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.188
Whoa, put that down!

249
00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.065
- Hey!
- Put down the knife!


250
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.150
Hey, hey!
What, I didn't take anything.


251
00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:16.319
Look, whatever it is,
I'll help you find it.


252
00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.363
I'll help you...
Whoa, put that down!


253
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.574
Hey, hey!

254
00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.743
Get away from me!
Where is my spade?!


255
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.286
- I didn't take it.
- You took it!


256
00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.664
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Holy shit.


257
00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:29.833
Tell her
I didn't take her damn spade!


258
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.668
That's where it was!
You took it!


259
00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:33.211
OK, OK!

260
00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.132
I need that spade!

261
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:40.260
- I need it!
- Get down from there.


262
00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:43.596
- They're all in here.
- I need that spade!


263
00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.434
Where here?! Where is it?!

264
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.853
Goddammit! Goddammit!

265
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.063
My spade!

266
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.356
Just check your rooms.

267
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.275
Did you check
all locked rooms? You OK?


268
00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.318
No, I'm not OK!
I'm fucking far from OK.


269
00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.404
- I'm sorry. I hurt my back.
- Here, take these keys.


270
00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:00.947
Look, I don't know, OK?

271
00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.700
Luis, I swear to God, if you
don't fucking get off my ass...


272
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:04.909
You fucking look.

273
00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.704
I'm gonna go just see
how she is.


274
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.877
Of course not.

275
00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.596
Wow, old school.

276
00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:26.139
- Luis?
- Yeah?


277
00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.641
- Is that it?
- Yeah, it was in the freezer.


278
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.518
It's the only place
she didn't look.


279
00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.729
Hey, Mom?

280
00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.647
Mom, we found your spade.

281
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.775
Maybe you wanna sit down, Mom?

282
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.152
Ma, can you talk to me, please?

283
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.279
Please, Mom, please.

284
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.410
Mom?

285
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.746
- Mom, you're scaring me.
- She knows.


286
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:52.123
Sarah.

287
00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:00.173
- Holy shit!
- Go get help.


288
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.550
Oh, my God. Someone...

289
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.693
Would you grab this?

290
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.778
Should we put you
in front or back?


291
00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.989
- In the front, I'll sit.
- In the front.


292
00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.867
I'm...
I'm just mortified.


293
00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:12.662
I would never dream
of speaking to anyone


294
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.124
the way I evidently spoke to you.

295
00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.169
I'm terribly sorry.

296
00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:20.753
It's...it's OK.

297
00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:26.426
Oh, look at the leaves.
Aren't they beautiful.


298
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.553
Glorious time of year.

299
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.472
What do you mean 'home'?
She's got a home. What kind of home?


300
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.809
You mean someplace
she should go lay up in a bed?


301
00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.895
You know,
under fluorescent light?


302
00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:39.898
Lay there all day,
stinking like urine?


303
00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:41.774
That's where you go to die,
my friend.


304
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.986
That ain't a place to live.
This is a place to live.


305
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.488
- She loves this.
- That shirt.


306
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.365
Oh, that shirt I hate.

307
00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:52.285
- Can't you wear a nice blouse?
- I don't have a blouse.


308
00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:53.912
Nice to see you too, Ma.

309
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.830
- I missed you, yeah.
- Nice to see you.


310
00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.373
- Yes, dear.
- Complimentary valet.


311
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.834
Oh, Harris, thank you
for all your help.


312
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.170
- How's your neck?
- It's fine, it's fine.


313
00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:05.131
Told you
to stay away from here.


314
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.727
I didn't know,
I didn't know, I didn't know.


315
00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:33.618
Please...please...

316
00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.414
Stop...

317
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.500
St-stop.

318
00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.377
No.

319
00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:44.379
No.

320
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.514
<i>Deborah's brain is</i>
<i>much like the switchboard</i>


321
00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.600
<i>she so adeptly worked on</i>
<i>for decades...</i>


322
00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.477
Go away, go away...

323
00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.562
<i>.. her misfiring synapses</i>
<i>like the phone lines</i>


324
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:05.400
<i>being pulled from their jacks,</i>
<i>losing connections.</i>


325
00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.529
<i>As memories are taken</i>
<i>one by one,</i>


326
00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:13.700
<i>it soon becomes clear that</i>
<i>you can't run from Alzheimer's.</i>


327
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.828
<i>You can only face it head-on,</i>

328
00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.289
<i>hopefully with dignity</i>
<i>and grace.</i>


329
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:20.498
No, no.

330
00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:24.085
<i>It becomes clear</i>
<i>that Sarah has found</i>


331
00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:26.254
<i>her own coping mechanisms.</i>

332
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:28.339
I've got no choice, babe.

333
00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.550
She...she's not making it easy.

334
00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.802
She doesn't want my help, so...

335
00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.973
Well, I got the U-Haul
from Monday, so...


336
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.183
My girlfriend, Shelly,
I could not tell her the truth.


337
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.812
I just told her I'm moving back home
for a couple of months.


338
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.315
I didn't have the balls
to tell her the truth.


339
00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:47.400
You guys come have a drink, OK?

340
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.528
It's been a long time since
I hung out, which is nice.


341
00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.405
- It's nice.
- Really?


342
00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.490
Yeah, it's good.

343
00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.826
That's funny.

344
00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.370
Why?
What's funny about it?


345
00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.748
It's just weird.

346
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.833
It's sweet, it's sweet.

347
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.086
You know, Ma, um...

348
00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:14.677
She sent me away to Richmond
in '76, boarding school.


349
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.764
- Really?
- I was 10.


350
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.308
She caught me
out in the garage...


351
00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:23.811
We had, like, a little outboard
out there for the winter.


352
00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.897
And I was hiding out there

353
00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:29.150
with little Annie Phelps, kissing.

354
00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:32.862
We didn't know
what we were doing.


355
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.203
And then Mom...
Mom was so mad,

356
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.914
she just got
all red-faced and...


357
00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.712
She was embarrassed.

358
00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:52.715
Yeah, whatever.

359
00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:57.637
To our
fucked-up childhoods.


360
00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.722
Yeah.

361
00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:05.978
Oh, yeah,
Saint Bernardine's.


362
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.064
Hated those uniforms!

363
00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:11.442
Well,
never was comfortable in a dress.


364
00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.444
Immaculate Conception here.

365
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.571
Oh, yeah?
Good Catholic boy, huh?


366
00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:17.657
Deb'll love you.

367
00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:24.288
- What was that?
- I'm gonna go check on Mom.


368
00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:27.458
OK.

369
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.886
What?

370
00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:41.264
Hey, Deb?

371
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.724
Deb?

372
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.518
Hey, Sarah?

373
00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:02.118
Deb?

374
00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:04.704
Are you OK?

375
00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:07.290
Standing in the dark.
That's awesome.


376
00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.208
Deborah?

377
00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:17.592
Arts and crafts project
at midnight, Mom?


378
00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.344
- Jesus.
- Huh?


379
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:22.597
She's convinced
there's been an intruder.


380
00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:25.349
Some...some guy in the yard.

381
00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:27.435
Yep.

382
00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:30.146
No-one out there, Mom.
Just the deer.


383
00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.231
See?

384
00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:34.066
She's got those
RadioShack motion thingies


385
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.610
all over the house.

386
00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:37.695
Yep.

387
00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.615
We're nailing
the windows shut again.


388
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:43.242
I've learned
not to argue with her.


389
00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.997
OK, I've checked
the upstairs bathroom.


390
00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:31.874
I've checked everywhere in here.

391
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.585
She was in bed. We went to bed.
I had to pee.


392
00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:36.629
I got up. I checked.
She was not there.


393
00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.965
- I'm gonna check out here.
- Alright, thank you, guys.


394
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.716
Deb?

395
00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.635
Mom?

396
00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.220
Mom?!

397
00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:47.890
Mom, I am not kidding you!

398
00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:50.601
- Come on!
- Oh, tetanus.


399
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:52.853
Uh, hey, Sarah?

400
00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.401
Oh, fuck.

401
00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:09.245
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.


402
00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:12.415
Deb?
Deb, what are you doing?!


403
00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:14.375
Mom, come back.

404
00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.127
- Hey, don't touch her!
- Listen to me!


405
00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:17.878
- Don't touch her!
- OK!


406
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.839
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

407
00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:22.174
Mom.

408
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:24.302
- Back up! Back up!
- Please, calm...


409
00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:27.263
Give her room.

410
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.724
OK, Mom.

411
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:39.817
OK, Deb, you just tell me
if this water is too hot.


412
00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.694
How does that feel?

413
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:43.821
Is that...

414
00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:45.698
Is that OK?

415
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:51.120
Oh, you really gave us all
quite a fright


416
00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:53.706
with your late-night gardening.

417
00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:57.335
Do you remember?

418
00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:01.756
You really don't remember, huh?

419
00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:04.300
That's OK?

420
00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:08.262
My daughter
doesn't like manicures.


421
00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:10.139
Sarah?

422
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:12.183
OK.

423
00:23:13.517 --> 00:23:16.646
She never cleans her nails.

424
00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:20.524
Well, don't worry.

425
00:23:20.691 --> 00:23:22.610
We're gonna clean up
your nails, Deb,


426
00:23:22.777 --> 00:23:25.780
and they will be back
to their perfect state soon.


427
00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:31.410
Alright, so I downloaded
some footage


428
00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:34.455
before Deborah's little...night scamper
into the garden, yeah?


429
00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:36.957
- Yeah.
- About 2:58, right?


430
00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:40.670
- Yeah?
- You're gonna wanna see this.


431
00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:42.755
What's she doing?

432
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.091
- Wait for it.
- Is she asleep?


433
00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:49.387
Yeah, she's asleep. OK,
we've seen her sleepwalk before.


434
00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:51.097
Bam.

435
00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.766
Whoa. What's the code?

436
00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.851
There's no break
in the timecode.


437
00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:57.770
She must've climbed a chair
or something, right?


438
00:23:57.937 --> 00:24:00.314
- She grabbed a chair and just...
- A fucking chair?


439
00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:02.900
- There's no chair in the shot.
- Do you see a chair?


440
00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:07.154
See, yeah,
that's the weird thing,


441
00:24:07.321 --> 00:24:10.366
'cause the timecode,
it's like it's one continuous...


442
00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:12.493
Right? Is that right?
It's one continuous...


443
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.704
- There's no break there.
- It's not...


444
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.497
Because that's impossible.

445
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:18.374
- Right?
- Yeah.


446
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:20.751
This is not normal.

447
00:24:20.918 --> 00:24:23.337
This is not a normal...
whatever you're calling it,


448
00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:25.297
somnambulism, or sleepwalking.

449
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.967
I've seen her do it before.
It's not this.


450
00:24:28.134 --> 00:24:29.927
Nazir said she's gonna
up the Villaquil,


451
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:31.804
so maybe that would help.

452
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:34.890
I have no idea. I hope so.
God, I hope so.


453
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:37.143
Oh, there's Harris.

454
00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:03.002
You climbed up
on the stove, right?


455
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:05.337
You could've hurt yourself,
or set the place on fire again.


456
00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:07.173
Do you remember that?

457
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.258
So I climbed up
on the stove. Big deal.


458
00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:11.260
Look, I'm staying here.
I'm not gonna go rot...


459
00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:14.096
Listen to me! Look at your hands.
Look at your neck.


460
00:25:14.263 --> 00:25:16.182
You're a menace to yourself.
Do you know that?


461
00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.267
Go back to Richmond.

462
00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:21.353
I know you miss
your lady friend, anyway.


463
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.315
Go. That's fine. 
I'm fine here.

464
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.234
How's that sound, Luis?

465
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:28.778
That's great.
That's great.


466
00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:31.030
Can we...

467
00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:35.951
- There you go.
- There we go.


468
00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:38.496
I'm going to put
a mic on you, OK?


469
00:25:38.662 --> 00:25:40.581
It's called a 'lavalier'.

470
00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:44.668
I'm just gonna put it
on the, uh...front here.


471
00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:47.546
There we go.
It's a very nice shirt.


472
00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:49.632
Very nice.

473
00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:52.510
- Can you see the cable?
- I'm on it. I'm on it.


474
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.053
- That's looking good.
- OK.


475
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.679
How are you feeling?

476
00:25:55.846 --> 00:25:59.517
Well, I was feeling peculiar,
but, uh...not now.


477
00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:03.646
Now I feel, um...right as rain.

478
00:26:03.813 --> 00:26:08.025
Deb, we have some footage
we'd like to show you.


479
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.074
Who is that, now?

480
00:26:17.952 --> 00:26:20.913
Is that me? What am I doing?
That is obscene.


481
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.916
- Why didn't you stop me?
- Uh...


482
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:28.879
We tried to stop you,
but you were in a fugue state.


483
00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:30.756
You were hallucinating.

484
00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:33.133
Mom, it was
really scary, OK?


485
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.845
You were stabbing at the ground
with your spade over and over,


486
00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:37.721
digging hole after hole.

487
00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:39.598
That's what you were doing.

488
00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:42.893
Then when we got inside,
you were sobbing, Mom.


489
00:26:45.855 --> 00:26:47.231
Jesus, Sarah.

490
00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:51.277
- Mom?
- I'm sorry.


491
00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:53.153
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.531
Mom, you kept telling me
not to answer the phone,


493
00:26:55.698 --> 00:26:57.408
like he was calling you.

494
00:26:57.575 --> 00:26:59.743
That's what you said.
Please talk to us.


495
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.830
Sarah,
maybe we should stop.


496
00:27:09.587 --> 00:27:11.797
Mom, stop it! No!

497
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:14.133
Mom, stop! No, no! No!

498
00:27:17.428 --> 00:27:19.138
Arggh!

499
00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:22.558
- Mom?
- Oh, God.


500
00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:25.978
- You alright, Gavin?
- Am I alright?


501
00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:27.897
- Is she alright?
- Sarah?


502
00:27:28.063 --> 00:27:29.773
OK. Alright.

503
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.942
- Sarah?
- Yes, I'm here, Mom.


504
00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:38.115
What's gonna happen
is you're gonna feel


505
00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:40.200
a pinch and then a burn.

506
00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:44.455
And I need you to not move
when you feel that pinch, OK?


507
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:47.124
Here we go. OK, here we go.

508
00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:49.168
It's almost over. OK.

509
00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:50.878
OK, don't move, don't move.

510
00:27:51.045 --> 00:27:52.755
- Don't move.
- Really good.


511
00:27:52.922 --> 00:27:55.382
Yeah.

512
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:58.052
Don't move. Don't move, honey.
Don't move. Don't move.


513
00:27:58.218 --> 00:28:00.304
Don't move. OK.

514
00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:02.389
<i>Over the next few weeks,</i>

515
00:28:02.556 --> 00:28:05.100
<i>the doctors run a number of tests</i>
<i>on Deborah</i>


516
00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:08.812
<i>in an attempt to explain</i>
<i>the anomalies in her condition.</i>


517
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:11.148
<i>Despite the painful procedures,</i>

518
00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:15.027
<i>the examinations raise more questions</i>
<i>than they answer.</i>


519
00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:18.822
<i>A disturbing infection</i>
<i>has occurred, resulting in</i>


520
00:28:18.989 --> 00:28:22.201
<i>an inexplicable scaly quality</i>
<i>to Deborah's skin.</i>


521
00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:24.411
Has she been around
any heavy metals?


522
00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:26.664
She does garden.
You know, I don't...


523
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.749
We don't have poison oak
or poison ivy.


524
00:28:28.916 --> 00:28:30.376
Do you use pesticides?

525
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:33.837
Make the vertical line
of the 'T'


526
00:28:34.004 --> 00:28:36.590
with the white blocks, OK, Deb?

527
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:38.133
Take your time.

528
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.219
- I can't.
- I just wanna see you...


529
00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:42.429
Whatever you can do,
just try it, Deb.


530
00:28:42.596 --> 00:28:44.139
- Can you do that?
- I tried.


531
00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:46.266
- There.
- You did?


532
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:48.394
OK, you know what?
Can you show...


533
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.522
Deb? Deb? Deb, don't!
Stop doing that, Deb!


534
00:28:51.689 --> 00:28:53.148
Deborah, stop, stop!

535
00:28:55.109 --> 00:28:57.987
Deborah, please...

536
00:28:58.153 --> 00:29:00.948
Initially, we suspected
contact dermatitis


537
00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:04.827
or some type of allergic reaction
to the medication...


538
00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:06.537
..'cause this, uh...condition

539
00:29:06.704 --> 00:29:10.124
is not typically associated
with Alzheimer's.


540
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.003
Although, um...when the immune
system is compromised,


541
00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:17.089
sometimes co-infections
can occur.


542
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.050
That's why we've, uh...

543
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:22.594
..we're bringing in
some specialists from Richmond.


544
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:55.586
- Is somebody already here?
- Yeah.


545
00:29:55.753 --> 00:29:57.671
Fuckin' hazards are on.

546
00:30:00.382 --> 00:30:01.425
Whoa.

547
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:05.888
- Sarah?
- Hello?


548
00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:07.681
- Deb?
- Hello?


549
00:30:07.848 --> 00:30:09.641
Hey, did you hear that?

550
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:11.727
- What was that?
- It's Deborah.


551
00:30:11.894 --> 00:30:14.646
Who is it?

552
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.774
- Hello?
- Just go in there.


553
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:21.111
What's going on?

554
00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:23.197
Get her legs!

555
00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:34.750
Gentle! Be gentle with her!

556
00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:36.960
Gentle!

557
00:30:37.127 --> 00:30:40.214
OK, come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go. Luis.


558
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.467
She was swallowing those things.

559
00:30:43.634 --> 00:30:45.719
We have some scissors.

560
00:30:50.224 --> 00:30:53.727
I don't see
why we have to do this.


561
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.022
Because you like to eat them.

562
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:58.899
I d...

563
00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:01.318
- Right?
- Oh, it's silly.


564
00:31:02.903 --> 00:31:04.613
Oh.

565
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.323
OK.

566
00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:10.202
Oh!

567
00:31:11.829 --> 00:31:13.247
Snakes.

568
00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:15.124
Alright, Luis...

569
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.251
..I know you always said
don't mess with your equipment.


570
00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:19.128
Where are you at right now?

571
00:31:19.294 --> 00:31:21.213
Fucking around with
asps or serpents


572
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.465
or whatever you call 'em
these days.


573
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:26.301
I'm gonna take
my Aunt Bonny's cross


574
00:31:26.468 --> 00:31:29.179
and I'm gonna put it
on the window.


575
00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:30.556
That's right.

576
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.884
What the...

577
00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:14.099
This lady's got issues.

578
00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:41.418
Oh, hey.

579
00:32:41.585 --> 00:32:44.046
Letting all my heat out.

580
00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:46.173
What? What?

581
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:53.180
It's a closed window.
What is that?


582
00:32:53.347 --> 00:32:55.682
That is an open window, Mia.

583
00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:57.976
Oh, God.

584
00:32:58.143 --> 00:33:00.771
Yeah, OK, so it's open.

585
00:33:00.938 --> 00:33:03.023
What?

586
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.526
That could be anything, right?
A draught, whatever.


587
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:10.530
If you guys are scared of
an old woman losing her mind, go on.


588
00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:12.074
I want double my rate.

589
00:33:12.241 --> 00:33:13.867
Double my fucking rate,
or I leave.


590
00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:15.744
- Oh, fuck.
- I walk right now.


591
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:16.787
Fine.

592
00:33:16.954 --> 00:33:19.164
- OK. Oh, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.


593
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:21.959
And if he gets it,
I get it too.


594
00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:29.883
Alright, you have
sweet dreams now, OK?


595
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.593
Hmm?

596
00:33:35.597 --> 00:33:37.140
OK.

597
00:34:35.574 --> 00:34:39.077
- Ugh.
- What in the fuck?


598
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.748
Damn, that's loud.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.


599
00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.291
I was having
the best dream.


600
00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:46.668
What is that noise?

601
00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:48.420
Oh, man,
no, no, no, no, no.


602
00:34:48.587 --> 00:34:50.505
- What, what, what?
- We're bolo on the lights.


603
00:34:50.672 --> 00:34:52.883
No, it's not the phone.

604
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.553
Hey, what is that?

605
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.764
- I'll get it. It's, uh...
- Oh, my god.


606
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.307
Mom's old switchboard system.

607
00:35:00.474 --> 00:35:02.100
It hasn't worked in years.
Are you OK?


608
00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:03.643
I'm gonna check on Mom.
One second.


609
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.479
OK.
Gav, where are you going?


610
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:08.106
I don't know. I'm going
downstairs to make a sandwich.


611
00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:10.567
Oh, my God. Fuck.

612
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:13.195
Mom's not in her room!

613
00:35:13.362 --> 00:35:14.863
- Mom! Mom!
- Deb?


614
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.823
Do you think
maybe she's turned on


615
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.700
the switchboard or something?

616
00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:20.786
- I don't know.
- Shh! Ma!


617
00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.830
- Hey.
- Fuck.


618
00:35:27.542 --> 00:35:29.961
- What the fuck?!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!


619
00:35:31.088 --> 00:35:33.715
- What is...
- What?


620
00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:36.885
Fuck.

621
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.195
What's that scratch?

622
00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:57.864
- See that scratch? What is that?
- Sounds like...


623
00:35:58.031 --> 00:35:59.449
Think it's coming
from over there.


624
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:01.576
Oh, my God. What is it?

625
00:36:01.743 --> 00:36:03.620
You think she's in there?

626
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:11.253
Shh! Shh, no.

627
00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.673
What if it's...

628
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.383
Just...

629
00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:23.265
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

630
00:36:23.432 --> 00:36:25.267
Oh, my...

631
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:28.854
Now it's open to see.

632
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.397
OK.

633
00:36:30.564 --> 00:36:32.190
Can you see anything?

634
00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:34.067
No, no, no, no.

635
00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:38.989
Oh, my God, Sarah.

636
00:36:39.156 --> 00:36:41.366
Ma?

637
00:36:41.533 --> 00:36:42.534
That one.

638
00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:45.579
That door is never open.
You go in first.


639
00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:46.788
- What?
- Yeah.


640
00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:48.457
You want the brown guy
to go first?


641
00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:52.210
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

642
00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:54.963
OK. OK, shh.

643
00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:59.759
Oh, gross. What the fuck?

644
00:36:59.926 --> 00:37:03.013
This shit ain't right.
This shit ain't right.


645
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:08.560
Oh, guys? Guys?

646
00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:10.687
- What?
- Oh, my God.


647
00:37:10.854 --> 00:37:12.397
Yeah.

648
00:37:15.025 --> 00:37:16.943
What the fuck?

649
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.029
Oh, my God.

650
00:37:20.197 --> 00:37:21.698
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

651
00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:29.831
- Sarah?
- Help me.


652
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:36.379
Mom, please. Mom?

653
00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:38.673
Oh, my God.

654
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.802
Oh, you're an ugly thing!

655
00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:45.305
- Jesus.
- You're an ugly thing!


656
00:37:53.563 --> 00:37:55.857
Arggh! Arggh!

657
00:37:56.024 --> 00:37:56.900
Shit.

658
00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:01.780
Someone call Dr. Nazir.
One of you guys call Dr. Nazir.


659
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.950
- OK.
- OK.


660
00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.910
- OK, OK.
- Calm down.


661
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:13.750
Mom, Mom, it's OK.

662
00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:16.586
- Mom.
- I've just...


663
00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:18.713
What? OK.

664
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.841
- OK, just breathe.
- We're good, we're good.


665
00:38:22.008 --> 00:38:23.468
Pupils are dilating.
That's good.


666
00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:25.011
Gonna get her water.

667
00:38:25.178 --> 00:38:27.639
OK, we need to get
her breathing under control.


668
00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:29.224
OK, OK.

669
00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:31.351
Just... OK, down.

670
00:38:36.898 --> 00:38:38.817
I know, Mom.

671
00:38:41.736 --> 00:38:43.613
Breathe with me.

672
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.490
OK, breathe with me.

673
00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:47.993
Shh.

674
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:55.417
- Yeah.
- Her vitals are fine.


675
00:38:55.584 --> 00:38:57.502
- Her brain is responsive.
- OK.


676
00:38:57.669 --> 00:39:00.755
All her motor functions are working.
They're all fine.


677
00:39:00.922 --> 00:39:02.841
She really needs to rest now.

678
00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:04.593
- OK.
- OK?


679
00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:07.554
It's a short-acting sedative, OK?

680
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:09.431
OK.

681
00:39:09.598 --> 00:39:11.308
It's very safe...

682
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:12.559
OK.

683
00:39:12.726 --> 00:39:14.811
..if she has to be restrained.

684
00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:17.105
It was 337.
Over and over.


685
00:39:17.272 --> 00:39:19.858
This one? Ask her about it.
Mention the number.


686
00:39:20.025 --> 00:39:21.401
She's trying to recall
someone specific.


687
00:39:21.568 --> 00:39:23.153
Help her single it out.

688
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.696
Someone like her especially,

689
00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:26.406
who's stubborn
and strong-willed,


690
00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:28.158
she's not gonna let this go.

691
00:39:28.325 --> 00:39:30.285
And if I did this,

692
00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:32.996
if I encouraged this memory
to come out,


693
00:39:33.163 --> 00:39:35.707
would she then have some peace?

694
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.335
Remember when
you asked me to pull


695
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:40.045
the sound off the camera
from the switchboard?


696
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:42.255
Yeah, well, I pulled
the sound off and, um...


697
00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:44.924
..and it was from the onboard camera,
so it wasn't very good.


698
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:46.593
And there was
some gibberish at the end.


699
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.136
Remember the gibberish
at the end?


700
00:39:48.303 --> 00:39:50.180
Alright, well,
I modulated the inflection.


701
00:39:50.347 --> 00:39:52.807
It wasn't like any acoustic range
I've ever heard before,


702
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:55.685
so I brought it down,
I sped it up, and...


703
00:39:55.852 --> 00:39:58.188
..translated this shit
online, dude.


704
00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:07.447
Who is it?

705
00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:10.033
That's your mom,
and that's French,


706
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.994
saying some shit about snakes,
"be my fifth", or some shit.


707
00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:14.871
Ma doesn't speak French.

708
00:40:15.038 --> 00:40:16.956
Look, I'm sorry,
that's French.


709
00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:19.501
I got
the fuckin' transcripts.


710
00:40:19.668 --> 00:40:22.045
I don't care
if she knows French or not.


711
00:40:22.212 --> 00:40:25.173
I ain't ever heard anything
like that before in my life.


712
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.050
You sure this is
the right file...


713
00:40:27.217 --> 00:40:29.678
- Yes, Mia, it's the right f...
- Turn it off.


714
00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:31.846
Please, just fuckin'
turn it off.


715
00:41:03.545 --> 00:41:05.463
Forward.

716
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.465
Yeah, easy.

717
00:41:09.509 --> 00:41:12.220
Damn, how many attics
you people got?


718
00:41:12.387 --> 00:41:15.348
Her switchboard records
are in here somewhere.


719
00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:17.642
No, hold on, hold on.

720
00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:20.186
Ah, bingo. That's it.

721
00:41:20.353 --> 00:41:22.313
There's definitely something there.
Can you feel it?


722
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.358
It's like...it's like
jammed in...it's jamming it.


723
00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:28.111
It's right at the back.
Wait, wait, wait.


724
00:41:28.278 --> 00:41:30.321
Oh, yeah, I can feel it.
I can feel it.


725
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:31.865
I can feel it. Wait. Wait.

726
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:33.408
Careful.

727
00:41:33.575 --> 00:41:34.951
Oh, fuck.

728
00:41:35.118 --> 00:41:36.995
Wait, there it is.

729
00:41:37.162 --> 00:41:39.748
Yeah, this is the 1971
and 1972 index here.


730
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:41.875
Yeah, but there's
no customer profile. See?


731
00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:43.168
- Yeah.
- That's weird.


732
00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:45.086
Mom was fastidious.
Mom was like...


733
00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:47.172
This is...
There should be no holes.


734
00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:49.299
Jack 337, there's nothing.

735
00:41:49.466 --> 00:41:51.217
- 336.
- Yeah.


736
00:41:51.384 --> 00:41:53.344
336 continued, and then...

737
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:54.888
- 338.
- Exactly.


738
00:41:55.054 --> 00:41:56.765
What's that?
What are you doing?


739
00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:58.850
The one page we need is
the one that's missing.


740
00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:00.393
It's been ripped out.

741
00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:06.649
Sarah, does Deb keep charcoal
in the house?


742
00:42:06.816 --> 00:42:08.193
Yeah.

743
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:10.278
- Yeah?
- I mean, in her art room.


744
00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:14.407
Hey, Mia, do you have a notebook,
like notebook paper?


745
00:42:14.574 --> 00:42:18.495
There's this little depression
that's right here.


746
00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:21.915
Just line it up here.

747
00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:24.083
OK. Here we go.

748
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.668
Oh, yeah.

749
00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:27.212
What?

750
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.297
- Here we go, here we go.
- Is it working?


751
00:42:29.464 --> 00:42:31.382
This is some serious
Scooby-Doo shit right here.


752
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.426
Look how nice
that is. '337'.


753
00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:35.178
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, great.


754
00:42:35.345 --> 00:42:37.514
- Here we go.
- So smart.


755
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.725
I wouldn't go that far.
Oh, what is that?


756
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:43.978
- Is that 'D'?
- D, E, J, A, R...


757
00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:46.606
DJ Raj?

758
00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:49.317
- Desjardins.
- Who is it?


759
00:42:49.484 --> 00:42:51.361
Huh!

760
00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:57.909
"Local paediatrician thought to have
killed some local girls."


761
00:42:58.952 --> 00:43:01.913
"Went missing
in the early '70s."


762
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.249
Yeah, I was young,
but I still remember the curfews.


763
00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:06.125
The whole state
was looking for him.


764
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:08.211
And she never once
talked about this guy?


765
00:43:08.378 --> 00:43:10.922
No. I mean, he was infamous.

766
00:43:11.965 --> 00:43:13.675
There was a whole documentary.

767
00:43:13.842 --> 00:43:15.885
I can't believe
you guys haven't heard...


768
00:43:16.052 --> 00:43:18.263
- Yeah?
- ..that name before.


769
00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.181
<i>Still no arrests have been made</i>

770
00:43:20.348 --> 00:43:21.933
<i>in the nightmare spree of killings</i>

771
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.811

<i>were found in their blood.</i>


777
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:41.327
<i>Whoever performed the murders</i>
<i>was re-enacting</i>


778
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:43.580
<i>a very specific</i>
<i>Monacan blood ritual -</i>


779
00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:46.749
<i>the cauterised symbol</i>
<i>of the snake consuming itself.</i>


780
00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:49.794
<i>The choice of the Monacan mines</i>
<i>was no accident,</i>


781
00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:52.380
<i>built over a cave system</i>
<i>sacred to the natives</i>


782
00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:55.383
<i>which fed directly</i>
<i>into the River Rouge.</i>


783
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.343
<i>Girls were sacrificed</i>

784
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.596
<i>during the times</i>
<i>of their first menstruations -</i>


785
00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:02.348
<i>'bleeding flowers'</i>
<i>as they were called.</i>


786
00:44:02.515 --> 00:44:05.393
<i>The blood of their oestrus</i>
<i>was offered to the demon</i>


787
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.478
<i>in exchange for immortality.</i>

788
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:10.189
<i>It's only when the local</i>
<i>paediatrician goes missing</i>


789
00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:12.483
<i>that interest in</i>
<i>the River Rouge case begins again.</i>


790
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.403
<i>Henri Desjardins</i>
<i>is well known, he's respected,</i>


791
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.488
<i>he does a lot of pro bono work.</i>

792
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:19.866
<i>And a month</i>
<i>after he goes missing</i>


793
00:44:20.033 --> 00:44:23.036
<i>a local paperboy directs</i>
<i>authorities to a house,</i>


794
00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:25.330
<i>claiming there's a strange odour</i>
<i>from the building.</i>


795
00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:27.707
<i>The stench was the worst</i>
<i>I have ever smelt.</i>


796
00:44:27.874 --> 00:44:29.792
<i>I mean, guys were gagging.</i>

797
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:32.337
<i>Then we saw the snakes everywhere,</i>
<i>hundreds of them,</i>


798
00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:35.882
<i>all kinds, just constrictors,</i>
<i>rattlesnakes...</i>


799
00:44:36.049 --> 00:44:38.635
<i>Monacan totems,</i>
<i>books on rituals.</i>


800
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:42.472
<i>Henri Desjardins</i>
<i>had the ultimate motive.</i>


801
00:44:42.639 --> 00:44:45.224
<i>He was dying.</i>
<i>He had Lou Gehrig's disease.</i>


802
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:48.436
<i>You understand how debilitating</i>
<i>that disease is, don't you?</i>


803
00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:51.022
<i>The Monacan ritual</i>
<i>required 5 victims</i>


804
00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:55.276
<i>to attain immortality and</i>
<i>be free from the human body,</i>


805
00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:57.904
<i>yet only 4 victims appear.</i>

806
00:44:58.071 --> 00:45:01.157
<i>I know he didn't</i>
<i>complete the ritual.</i>


807
00:45:02.784 --> 00:45:04.827
<i>Maybe he had second thoughts.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>


808
00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:08.706
<i>Despite a massive manhunt</i>
<i>spanning two borders,</i>


809
00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:10.667
<i>Desjardins is never seen again</i>

810
00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:13.211
<i>and his whereabouts</i>
<i>become the stuff of legend.</i>


811
00:45:13.378 --> 00:45:15.463
<i>Some say that</i>
<i>he fled back to Quebec,</i>


812
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.841
<i>others that he...</i>
<i>he killed himself.</i>


813
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:24.222
I got up this morning
to make coffee


814
00:45:24.389 --> 00:45:26.099
and she was on the stoop.

815
00:45:28.893 --> 00:45:31.020
I'm going to ask her.

816
00:45:32.063 --> 00:45:33.731
Yeah.

817
00:45:36.484 --> 00:45:39.153
Do you remember
a man named, um...


818
00:45:40.196 --> 00:45:42.281
..Henri Desjardins?

819
00:45:42.448 --> 00:45:47.370
He was, uh...like, a local paediatrician
around here


820
00:45:47.537 --> 00:45:49.497
a long time ago.

821
00:45:55.837 --> 00:45:57.797
That name...

822
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.426
- Yeah.
- Yeah?


823
00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:04.178
That name sounds familiar.

824
00:46:04.345 --> 00:46:07.223
Was he, like,
a client of yours or...


825
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.142
Maybe?

826
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.731
I don't know.

827
00:46:18.818 --> 00:46:20.570
I think so.

828
00:46:22.697 --> 00:46:25.450
Well, he just
went missing a while ago,


829
00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:28.244
over 30 years ago,
so, you know...


830
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:30.621
He's not missing.

831
00:46:31.873 --> 00:46:35.084
He's dead.

832
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:42.925
How do you know that, Mom?

833
00:46:46.095 --> 00:46:49.640
Murdered.

834
00:46:51.434 --> 00:46:53.603
Murdered?

835
00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.360
Ma?

836
00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:03.696
M...Ma?

837
00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:06.157
Sarah, it's me.
Do you need a hand?


838
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:16.834
Stay with her.
I'm calling an ambulance.


839
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:18.628
- What's going on?
- Stay with her!


840
00:47:18.795 --> 00:47:20.963
Luis, what is...

841
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.924
Oh, my God. Deb?

842
00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:25.009
Oh, my God.

843
00:47:25.176 --> 00:47:27.220
Oh, Deb...

844
00:47:30.723 --> 00:47:32.725
Voice changes,
self-alteration,


845
00:47:32.892 --> 00:47:34.811
feeling as if your body
belongs to someone else


846
00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:38.773
all hallmarks of
split personality disorder.


847
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.566
We'll run a DDIS.

848
00:47:40.733 --> 00:47:42.443
What about the skin?

849
00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:44.529
The biopsies came back
negative for ichthyosis.


850
00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:47.323
We're still searching.

851
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.575
She puked fucking earthworms.

852
00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:52.245
Your mother's
a gardener, right? Your mom?


853
00:47:52.411 --> 00:47:54.205
You said she tried to
swallow some objects before?


854
00:47:54.372 --> 00:47:55.915
You can't be serious.

855
00:47:56.082 --> 00:47:58.000
Well, she's out back
in the garden,


856
00:47:58.167 --> 00:48:00.378
she scoops up some soil...

857
00:48:02.338 --> 00:48:04.757
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, you can't be in here.


858
00:48:06.843 --> 00:48:08.803
Come on. Come with us.
You come with us.


859
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.389
That's her
neighbour Harris.


860
00:48:56.601 --> 00:48:58.895
Obviously she did know him.

861
00:48:59.061 --> 00:49:01.063
Desjardins was
her client, Harris.


862
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.691
What... Don't try and bullshit.
Why are you acting like...


863
00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:06.611
Nazir told us to!

864
00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:09.238
She's speaking French,
obsessed with the guy.


865
00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:11.324
He was her fucking client!

866
00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.993
Fucker. Yeah, hang up.

867
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:18.080
We think Harris is being shady to...
I don't know. Protect Deb.


868
00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:21.751
But what if Harris is trying
to protect himself?


869
00:49:21.918 --> 00:49:23.753
It says he was
brought in for questioning.


870
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.546
- Yeah, twice.
- Look.


871
00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:27.506
Here's an article I found.

872
00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:29.634
"Eyewitnesses say Sredl skulking
around the Desjardins residence


873
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.136
"and scenes of the crime."

874
00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:34.222
Well, I'm stupid.
What are you getting at?


875
00:49:34.388 --> 00:49:37.850
Well, after
Desjardins disappears.


876
00:49:38.017 --> 00:49:39.560
Mia, come on.

877
00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:41.437
What if Sredl
for some reason


878
00:49:41.604 --> 00:49:43.522
he wants to save the girls
or whatever


879
00:49:43.689 --> 00:49:46.692
he murders this
Desjardins guy, right,


880
00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:49.695
and then Deborah, who's his best friend
in the whole world,


881
00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:52.323
has to cover for him
and take the secret


882
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.951
and she buries it,
like, so deep,


883
00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:57.870
it takes a disease
to bring it to the surface?


884
00:49:58.037 --> 00:49:59.830
Oh, come on.
It says he's missing.


885
00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:02.166
It doesn't say anything
about him being dead.


886
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:04.210
- It's so paper thin.
- It's not, though!


887
00:50:04.377 --> 00:50:06.295
I'm ordering
some dinner, OK?


888
00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:09.006
Yeah, why don't you get
on the phone and find somewhere?


889
00:50:09.173 --> 00:50:10.883
Somewhere with salad.

890
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:12.760
Oh, yeah, somewhere with salad.

891
00:50:12.927 --> 00:50:14.637
In this booming metropolis,

892
00:50:14.804 --> 00:50:17.306
I'm sure I'll find
a fucking salad emporium.


893
00:50:18.516 --> 00:50:20.226
What was that?!

894
00:50:20.393 --> 00:50:22.478
- What was that?
- I think it came...


895
00:50:22.645 --> 00:50:24.981
- Did it come from out there?
- Yeah, it came from out there!


896
00:50:25.147 --> 00:50:26.857
What the fuck was that?

897
00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:29.068
Somebody's out there.

898
00:50:29.235 --> 00:50:30.903
- There's a man out there!
- Shut up!


899
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.613
Oh, my God, Sarah,
he's walking...


900
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.156
Hit the lights.
Stay down!


901
00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:37.910
Get away from the windows!

902
00:50:38.077 --> 00:50:39.745
- It's Harris.
- What?


903
00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:41.956
Gavin,
I don't have my phone!


904
00:50:42.123 --> 00:50:44.458
I don't know.
He's shooting up the fucking...


905
00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:46.252
- He shot out the window!
- Oh, God!


906
00:50:46.419 --> 00:50:48.129
Harris,
what the fuck are you doing?!


907
00:50:48.296 --> 00:50:50.548
- Are you calling the cops?!
- That's my mom's minivan!


908
00:50:50.715 --> 00:50:52.258
Yeah, I'm at... 
Yo, the address!

909
00:50:52.425 --> 00:50:54.343
I wanna report a shooting.

910
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.387
- Calm down!
- He's shooting a gun!


911
00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:58.556
- What's the address?
- 61 Pine Hollow.


912
00:50:58.723 --> 00:51:00.266
Pine Hollow!

913
00:51:32.173 --> 00:51:34.633
Mr. Sredl will
sleep it off in the tank.


914
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.886
Like I said, you're more
than welcome to press charges...


915
00:51:37.053 --> 00:51:38.763
You're damn straight
we wanna press charges.


916
00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.973
Gavin, I told you
I'd fix your windows.


917
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.434
Y'all can just let me know
what you decide.


918
00:52:11.796 --> 00:52:13.714
Luis, get that fucking camera
out of my face.


919
00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:15.591
- Can we talk about this?
- No!


920
00:52:15.758 --> 00:52:17.718
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm fucking leaving.


921
00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:20.513
You start projects like this
and you just bounce in the middle?


922
00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:22.390
If it's just about the window...

923
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:24.266
It's not about the window, OK?!

924
00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:26.811
That's just fucking icing
on top of the shitty fucking cake.


925
00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.521
What about the switchboard, huh?

926
00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:30.398
What about the fucking window
opening and closing?


927
00:52:30.564 --> 00:52:32.233
The bitch levitated
onto a counter!


928
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.276
The Gavin train's pulling out, bro.
Last call, man.


929
00:52:34.443 --> 00:52:36.737
You need this pay cheque
as much as I do.


930
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:38.906
Luis knows how
to be a team player!


931
00:52:39.073 --> 00:52:41.033
- Fuck both of you.
- No. Gavin.


932
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.077
Gavin, I'm... Hey!

933
00:52:43.244 --> 00:52:44.870
See you later, buddy!

934
00:52:45.037 --> 00:52:46.664
God!

935
00:52:52.253 --> 00:52:55.381
Hey, Sarah?
You wanna grab some grub?


936
00:52:56.424 --> 00:52:59.468
Shit. Hey, Mia.

937
00:53:00.678 --> 00:53:02.972
I'm gonna get Nazir.

938
00:53:18.404 --> 00:53:20.197
I understand
what you guys are going through...


939
00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:21.824
We just went to the canteen.

940
00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:24.952
We...we came back
and her room was empty.


941
00:53:25.119 --> 00:53:27.955
She was gone.
I don't understand why that woman...


942
00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:29.874
We don't know.

943
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.584
We've got the hospital
on lockdown.


944
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:33.377
We believe she's still
in the building.


945
00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:35.254
- She's sick.
- I know, I know.


946
00:53:35.421 --> 00:53:37.298
We're gonna find her, OK?
Guys, just calm down.


947
00:53:37.465 --> 00:53:39.425
What are you doing
to get our daughter back?


948
00:53:39.592 --> 00:53:41.552
<i>Security, patient was seen</i>

949
00:53:41.719 --> 00:53:43.679
<i>leading the girl</i>
<i>to the abandoned wing,</i>


950
00:53:43.846 --> 00:53:46.098
<i>possibly the kitchen.</i>

951
00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:49.059
Deborah?

952
00:53:50.102 --> 00:53:51.979
There's no power here.
Watch yourself.


953
00:53:53.022 --> 00:53:55.357
Arggh!

954
00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.404
Deborah?

955
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:03.491
Why? Why would
she take her in here?


956
00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:06.118
- What is she...
- I don't know.


957
00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:07.995
When we were moving your mom
from Critical


958
00:54:08.162 --> 00:54:10.998
she saw the girl
and whispered something to her.


959
00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:19.131
All clear over here.

960
00:54:28.766 --> 00:54:31.769
- What was that?
- Let's go check it out.


961
00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:39.360
Alright.

962
00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:43.697
- Goddamn interference.
- She's not in there, man.


963
00:54:43.864 --> 00:54:47.117
- We already checked.
- Now you tell me, fucker.


964
00:55:00.089 --> 00:55:01.882
Deb?

965
00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:06.387
Deborah?

966
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:15.396
Deborah?

967
00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:21.318
Deborah, can you hear me?

968
00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:25.573
I need you to listen to me, OK?

969
00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:29.076
I know she's your friend

970
00:55:29.243 --> 00:55:32.871
and you can come visit her
any time you want.


971
00:55:33.038 --> 00:55:34.957
OK, Deborah?

972
00:55:35.124 --> 00:55:37.835
But you need
to let go of her hand.


973
00:55:42.548 --> 00:55:47.094
She can come
see you later, OK?


974
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:49.305
Let's go.

975
00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:11.535
Get her down!

976
00:56:11.702 --> 00:56:13.537
Watch it. Get her arm!

977
00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:15.289
I'm trying!

978
00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:20.836
What's happening?

979
00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:24.173
- That's my mom, OK?
- Hold her, hold her.


980
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.258
Oh...

981
00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:33.849
- Alright, it's in.
- Do something, please.


982
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.940
Thanks for
meeting me out here.


983
00:56:42.107 --> 00:56:44.109
I just...

984
00:56:44.276 --> 00:56:47.029
..I just didn't want
to talk about this in there.


985
00:56:47.196 --> 00:56:49.698
I can bless your mom with oils.

986
00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:51.742
An exorcism is really

987
00:56:51.909 --> 00:56:53.952
in the realm
of science fiction, Sarah.


988
00:56:54.119 --> 00:56:56.080
I...I used to think that.

989
00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.374
- I still do maybe, but...
- I know.


990
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.167
- But it's not gonna hurt.
- I know.


991
00:57:00.334 --> 00:57:02.127
We've tried
everything else.


992
00:57:02.294 --> 00:57:04.672
- I understand.
- No, you don't know.


993
00:57:04.838 --> 00:57:07.508
Sarah, it's something
that we just don't do.


994
00:57:07.675 --> 00:57:09.760
Yeah, you do.
You have to know someone.


995
00:57:09.927 --> 00:57:12.596
A mentor of yours. Someone.
You've gotta help me.


996
00:57:12.763 --> 00:57:14.890
You need to accept this.

997
00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:17.059
You really do.

998
00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:20.020
There's something else going on.

999
00:57:20.187 --> 00:57:23.565
There is something else going on.

1000
00:57:29.113 --> 00:57:30.864
What's Harris doing here?

1001
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:32.991
He's been visiting
the last couple of days.


1002
00:57:33.158 --> 00:57:35.035
Just give him some space.

1003
00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:44.878
I made contact with
the anthropology professor


1004
00:57:45.045 --> 00:57:47.005
from the 'River Rouge' doc.

1005
00:57:47.172 --> 00:57:49.091
I'm Mia. I spoke with you
on the phone.


1006
00:57:49.258 --> 00:57:51.343
Thank you so much
for making some time for us.


1007
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:53.387
- This is Sarah Logan.
- Hi, Sarah.


1008
00:57:53.554 --> 00:57:55.639
Luis, my cameraman. I explained
we'll be doing some shooting...


1009
00:57:55.806 --> 00:57:57.349
Right. Please, have a seat.

1010
00:57:59.727 --> 00:58:02.521
<i>I tried</i>
<i>to wash you in the river...</i>


1011
00:58:04.732 --> 00:58:07.234
The most logical explanation
for all this...


1012
00:58:09.027 --> 00:58:10.738
..is that your mother
has become obsessed


1013
00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:13.407
with the notable,
public boogieman


1014
00:58:13.574 --> 00:58:16.577
to the extent that
she believes she is Desjardins.


1015
00:58:16.744 --> 00:58:20.164
With all due respect, sir,
this is more than that, OK?


1016
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:24.001
And that's why we're here...
for your help.


1017
00:58:24.168 --> 00:58:27.963
However, the notion
of spiritual parasites


1018
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:31.216
does exists among
many thousands of cultures


1019
00:58:31.383 --> 00:58:33.427
in various incarnations -

1020
00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:36.096
the Masai, the Inuit,
Aborigines.


1021
00:58:36.263 --> 00:58:38.599
The belief is that
a weak mind is susceptible


1022
00:58:38.766 --> 00:58:42.436
to the invasion of vengeful entities
seeking a host.


1023
00:58:42.603 --> 00:58:46.064
The young and the very old
are most vulnerable,


1024
00:58:46.231 --> 00:58:48.317
as well as the infirm.

1025
00:58:49.943 --> 00:58:53.947
Living among the Bantu,
I saw a young mother


1026
00:58:54.114 --> 00:58:57.117
so overwrought by the loss
of her son to typhoid...


1027
00:58:57.284 --> 00:58:59.203
Yeah?

1028
00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:03.081
..that she held his wasting corpse
for over a month.


1029
00:59:03.248 --> 00:59:05.042
Oh, my God.

1030
00:59:05.209 --> 00:59:07.211
She fell into madness.

1031
00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:11.548
I tried to help her.
She was beyond reason.


1032
00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:13.509
She took on
the boy's affectations,


1033
00:59:13.675 --> 00:59:15.761
his personality, his voice.

1034
00:59:15.928 --> 00:59:17.888
She became him.

1035
00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:21.016
It took 2 months
before the spell was broken.


1036
00:59:21.183 --> 00:59:23.185
Broken how?

1037
00:59:25.687 --> 00:59:28.357
A witchdoctor...

1038
00:59:28.524 --> 00:59:31.318
..a witchdoctor came

1039
00:59:31.485 --> 00:59:33.237
and burned the boy's body,

1040
00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:36.490
flesh to ash,
purification by fire.


1041
01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.731
The door...

1042
01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:18.532
Oh...

1043
01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.661
We don't have to do this.

1044
01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:25.664
No, no, Debbie...

1045
01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.838
Kill me.

1046
01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:15.756
Ugh!

1047
01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:22.095
Well, this can't be good.

1048
01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:25.557
Luis, wait up! Wait!

1049
01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:28.477
Nazir said something
happened to Harris.


1050
01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:30.604
Take it easy.
Deep breath, deep breath.


1051
01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:33.732
OK, it's alright, it's alright.
Nice and easy.


1052
01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.525
- Oh, Dad...
- I'm sorry, ma'am...


1053
01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.319
I'm his daughter.
I'm his daughter.


1054
01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:39.780
- We're prepping him for surgery.
- I know. I appreciate that.


1055
01:01:39.947 --> 01:01:41.865
But, please, just one second.
I'm begging you.


1056
01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.742
- Bless your heart. Thank you.
- Security!


1057
01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.744
Dad? Yeah?

1058
01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:18.193
Where?

1059
01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.696
Ma'am,
you can't be in here!


1060
01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.322
- Harris, where? Where?
- Get her out!


1061
01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:23.907
Please come with me
right now!


1062
01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.701
Ma'am, ma'am,
please leave!


1063
01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:27.619
- Harris, where?!
- Come on, ma'am.


1064
01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:30.622
You have to go outside.

1065
01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:33.208
She buried him
in the backyard.


1066
01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.127
- Stop her, please!
- Where are you going?


1067
01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:37.295
Then she got sick
and he infected her.


1068
01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.381
- What are you looking for?
- This looks loose.


1069
01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:41.508
- Desjardins.
- Huh? Whose idea was this?


1070
01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:43.760
Was this Harris's idea,
Sarah, huh?


1071
01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.721
- This is insane.
- Help me, OK?!


1072
01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.347
- What?
- Please, Mia!


1073
01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:49.558
- Where? Sarah, tell me where.
- All around here. Just dig.


1074
01:02:49.725 --> 01:02:51.476
- Right here?
- Yes.


1075
01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:54.104
Guys, this is insane.
We're digging holes in the woods!


1076
01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.815
Either help us
or shut the fuck up!


1077
01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:59.484
Sleepwalking outside, she was
trying to find it - the remains.


1078
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:02.362
Or He was.
He was inhabiting her. Shit.


1079
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.656
- The soil...
- It's different, right?


1080
01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.533
- It is loose.
- Is it really?


1081
01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.160
OK, thank you.

1082
01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:10.162
It could've been rain,
could've been moisture...


1083
01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.789
Do we really think
that there is a body here?


1084
01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:14.666
You gotta let it go.

1085
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:17.544
It was an old man saying
some crazy stuff on a hospital bed.


1086
01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.880
I don't think so, OK?
I don't think so!


1087
01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.465
I promise...I promise you

1088
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.175
we will look somewhere else
in the morning.


1089
01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.052
- I'll do it.
- We're four feet deep.


1090
01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:26.803
- There's nothing.
- But this is where he said!


1091
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.555
We could've started here.
I don't know.


1092
01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.432
- It could be anywhere here.
- Exactly!


1093
01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:32.976
- We're gonna be here all night.
- I'm sick of this.


1094
01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.603
- Fuck!
- There's nothing here.


1095
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.438
Wait.

1096
01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.231
What was that?

1097
01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:44.404
What? No way. No way.

1098
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.281
Do you... Oh, my God.

1099
01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:48.450
- Are you kidding me?
- She got here first.


1100
01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.327
- What?
- Who? What?


1101
01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:52.662
Oh, my God. Ma got here first.

1102
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.915
Look for fresh footprints,
anything fresh.


1103
01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:57.167
Where would you hide it?
Where would you hide it?


1104
01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.044
- I don't know.
- Nothing back there.


1105
01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:00.587
I can see through.
There's nothing here.


1106
01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:02.214
The whole house,
you guys.


1107
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.757
Sarah...

1108
01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:05.550
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?!


1109
01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.636
It was sometimes her,
it was sometimes Desjardins


1110
01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:10.347
and...and he's
making her keep it.


1111
01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:12.766
She's got a cubby for everything.
She's a hoarder.


1112
01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:15.227
- She has a space for everything.
- I'm following you.


1113
01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:17.646
If we can find...
He inhabits her body.


1114
01:04:17.813 --> 01:04:19.564
She... He had her dig it up.

1115
01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.733
Even if Desjardins
had been buried in the garden,


1116
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.443
just think about it, OK?

1117
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.362
It's been years.
There would be nothing left!


1118
01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:27.447
- I mean, he'd be decomposed...
- Back here, back here!


1119
01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.241
OK, I got it, I got it.

1120
01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:31.284
Anything that
was left of him would be...


1121
01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:32.953
- Fucking shit. Nothing.
- Nothing.


1122
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.080
Hey, guys.

1123
01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.086
What are you looking at?

1124
01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:46.258
I don't know,
but it hasn't rained in a while.


1125
01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:49.344
It should not be wet.
That looks fresh as hell.


1126
01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:57.102
A third goddamn attic?

1127
01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.233
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.


1128
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.152
I'm so fucking sorry. Hello?

1129
01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:07.195
Luis, you go first.
You got the light.


1130
01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.072
- Fuck no!
- Come on, man.


1131
01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.241
We've already been through this.
You go first, OK?


1132
01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.451
White people

1133
01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:16.371
and their basements
and fucking attics.


1134
01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:19.291
Damn! It fucking stinks up here.

1135
01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.668
- Oh, my God...
- Can you shine the...


1136
01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.628
Hold on a second. Hold on.

1137
01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:25.964
Oh, my God.
What is all this shit?


1138
01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:28.675
You gotta see this.

1139
01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:32.470
What is that stuff? Oh!

1140
01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:35.307
No idea.
Don't touch that. Ugh!


1141
01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:50.572
Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia!

1142
01:05:50.739 --> 01:05:53.783
What? What is that?

1143
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:56.828
What is it?

1144
01:05:57.871 --> 01:05:59.789
- I can't...
- Jesus.


1145
01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.666
Is it stuck?

1146
01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.002
Let me...

1147
01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.129
- Ooh, Jesus!
- Jesus!


1148
01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.007
- Oh, it... Oh, my...
- Oh, it fucking smells!


1149
01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:11.509
God, that smells
fucking awful.


1150
01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:16.640
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1151
01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.351
What is it?

1152
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.814
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Nmm...


1153
01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.576
Oh!

1154
01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:38.370
- Oh!
- It's...


1155
01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:40.705
- What? What? What?
- What the hell did you see?


1156
01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:42.332
What did you see?

1157
01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:44.626
- Oh!
- Oh, fuck!


1158
01:06:44.793 --> 01:06:46.253
- It's him!
- Oh, my God.


1159
01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.129
There's
a fucking body up here!


1160
01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:50.507
- My God.
- We have to, we have to!


1161
01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.384
I'm not touching him.

1162
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.469
- I will do it. I will.
- I'm not touching him.


1163
01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:57.722
I fucking can't thank you enough,
you guys. Oh, my God!


1164
01:06:57.889 --> 01:06:59.724
- Go, go, go, go!
- Easy.


1165
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:01.476
Oh, my God.

1166
01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:04.562
What are we...
what are we doing with this?


1167
01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:06.648
- What are we doing?
- I don't...


1168
01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:09.609
- We'll just put it here for now.
- Oh, God.


1169
01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:12.570
- Ugh...
- What are we doing?


1170
01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:14.823
We burn it, right?
Isn't that what Dr. Schiffer said?


1171
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:16.700
- Right here?
- Yes!


1172
01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.869
This day just
gets better and better.


1173
01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.205
Fucking dead bodies...

1174
01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:27.335
- Did you hear that?
- Shit.


1175
01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:29.379
It's coming
from inside here.


1176
01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.172
- What are doing?
- I don't know.


1177
01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:33.008
- Mia...
- Just wait, just wait.


1178
01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.926
Don't...

1179
01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.929
Whoa! Oh!

1180
01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:41.016
- No!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!


1181
01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.310
We gotta burn this.
We gotta burn this!


1182
01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.145
- What?! Fuck!
- Please!


1183
01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:48.231
There's one more here,
there's one more here!


1184
01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:50.066
Get it in! Get it in there!

1185
01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.193
- Fuck!
- Fuck!


1186
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.987
Watch your feet, Luis!
Watch your feet!


1187
01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.407
- OK, OK...
- Fuck!


1188
01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.784
- Oh!
- Sorry! Back off.


1189
01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:01.828
- That is fucking impossible!
- You haven't put enough on.


1190
01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:04.080
You haven't put enough on.
Oh, nothing, nothing!


1191
01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.665
You have
to push the thing!


1192
01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:08.001
- I'm pushing it! I'm pushing it!
- No, you're not!


1193
01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:09.753
- Yes, yes.
- Is it going?!


1194
01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.713
- OK, OK.
- Yes!


1195
01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.340
- Back, back.
- Burn, bitch. Burn.


1196
01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.175
Now let's get the fuck
out of here.


1197
01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:17.635
What...

1198
01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:21.681
Go, go, go, go!

1199
01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.558
It didn't burn.
It didn't burn!


1200
01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.894
- Something put it out!
- What?


1201
01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.733
Get away from
the fucking house! Run!


1202
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.526
Oh!

1203
01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.737
- There was something in there.
- Are you OK?


1204
01:08:35.904 --> 01:08:38.073
- Did you see it?
- I don't know!


1205
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:40.658
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1206
01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:43.328
- Hold on. What did you see?
- Someone's ringing.


1207
01:08:43.495 --> 01:08:47.040
Wait, wait. Is that your phone?

1208
01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:49.250
Hello. What?

1209
01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:52.253
Oh... What? No.

1210
01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.880
- Oh, God.
- What?


1211
01:08:54.047 --> 01:08:56.216
- She broke out of the hospital.
- You can't go back!


1212
01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:57.926
I'm going back in.
I've gotta get him.


1213
01:08:58.093 --> 01:09:00.136
- Sarah, please! Sarah!
- Do something, do something!


1214
01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.722
We have to take
the remains with us.


1215
01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:05.683
She broke the restraints, OK?
She's out.


1216
01:09:06.726 --> 01:09:08.269
- Fuck.
- Sarah, Sarah!


1217
01:09:08.436 --> 01:09:10.271
- What the fuck happened?
- Please don't go in there.


1218
01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:12.232
- Don't go in there!
- You can't come in here.


1219
01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:14.025
- Ma'am, stop!
- Get out of my way!


1220
01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:15.819
Oh, my God...

1221
01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:17.862
- I'm coming downstairs now.
- What is that?


1222
01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.532
A security guard downstairs
is in anaphylactic shock.


1223
01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.534
- You have to stay here.
- He's being treated now.


1224
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.452
- For what, Nazir? For what?!
- Snake venom!


1225
01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:42.971
That is fucking bullshit!

1226
01:09:43.138 --> 01:09:45.515
You are not doing everything you can!
You keep saying that.


1227
01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.392
Everybody tells me
they're doing...


1228
01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:49.436
- Hey, calm down!
- We are, sir.


1229
01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.229
- We're so sorry.
- I wanna know!


1230
01:09:51.396 --> 01:09:53.189
- We'll find her.
- I wanna know what happened!


1231
01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:54.941
- Where is my girl?!
- We're trying.


1232
01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:37.817
We've got a 5-mile
perimeter...


1233
01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:41.529
We go back a long way.
I'm begging you.


1234
01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:44.115
- Of course we do. I...
- OK, OK, I'm coming, right?


1235
01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:45.992
Well, he's gotta
complete the ritual,


1236
01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.869
right, the fifth girl?

1237
01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:50.079
There's only one place he'd go
the cave system.


1238
01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.165
He's headed to Monacan Mountain.

1239
01:10:52.332 --> 01:10:54.292
She's the fifth? She's gonna
complete it all for him?


1240
01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:56.169
That's who he's picked, right?

1241
01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:59.589
I'm gonna fill
those syringes Nazir gave us.


1242
01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:03.009
There's the car.
She's walking.


1243
01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:06.596
Get in!
There's a fire trail on the other side.


1244
01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:09.599
It gets us about halfway up.
We need to get the jump on them.


1245
01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.060
- Keep going.
- Here we go!


1246
01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:17.440
This is the fire trail

1247
01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.317
so it should get us
up pretty close.


1248
01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:21.361
Requesting backup
on River Rouge trailhead.


1249
01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:23.905
We're heading north.

1250
01:11:24.072 --> 01:11:26.241
- Whoa! I see something.
- There they are.


1251
01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.284
- Oh, my God.
- She's got the girl.


1252
01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:30.286
Everybody, stay back.

1253
01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.580
Sheriff Tweed, Sheriff Tweed,
I have this sedative.


1254
01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:34.624
If you can restrain her
I can administer it.


1255
01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.417
Alright, stay behind me,
but get ready.


1256
01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:38.419
- OK.
- OK, OK, OK.


1257
01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.755
- Mrs. Logan?
- Linda, careful.


1258
01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:43.383
Can you hear me? I just
want you to know we're here.


1259
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:45.260
I don't want to alarm you.

1260
01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.220
We're here to help, OK?

1261
01:11:48.263 --> 01:11:50.515
- Deb?
- Do you see this?


1262
01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:53.810
Deb, can you hear me?
It's...it's Linda.


1263
01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:57.188
- Mom?
- No sudden movements.


1264
01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:59.524
We need you
to release the child, ma'am.


1265
01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:03.152
Deb, I need you to turn around
for me real slow, OK?


1266
01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.988
You alright, honey?

1267
01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:07.657
Cara, are you OK?
Cara, are you hurt?


1268
01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.534
Don't hurt him.

1269
01:12:09.701 --> 01:12:11.244
- He's a nice man.
- Alright, Deb?


1270
01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:13.037
He's gonna
wash me in the river.


1271
01:12:13.204 --> 01:12:15.039
- Deb, let's...
- Jesus H. Christ.


1272
01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.833
..about getting you
down this mountain, OK?


1273
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.835
No sudden movements
from anybody.


1274
01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:21.879
Real still, Deb. We're gonna do
everything real slow here, OK?


1275
01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.591
He's gonna
wash me in the river.


1276
01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:27.302
- Don't hurt him.
- Yeah, it's alright, Deb.


1277
01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:29.429
- We got it.
- He's gonna wash me...


1278
01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:31.639
Look at that. Everything's OK.

1279
01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:33.600
Don't hurt him. 
He's a nice man.

1280
01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:37.520
Alright, you gotta be real
still for me, nice and easy...


1281
01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.147
Arggh!

1282
01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:41.566
- Are you alright?!
- Ma, no!


1283
01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:48.865
- Ow!
- Are you alright?


1284
01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.159
- Get the girl, the girl...
- I'm gonna get her, alright?


1285
01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:52.952
- Come on.
- No, you gotta get the girl.


1286
01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:54.912
I need somebody to
get him down the mountain!


1287
01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:56.789
- Is he alright?
- Oh, God! It burns!


1288
01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.666
Take the sheriff's car
and get him down.


1289
01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.877
Luis, that's gotta be you, man.
That's gotta be you.


1290
01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:02.754
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm sorry.


1291
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.298
I can't...I can't leave Sarah.
I can't leave the girl.


1292
01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:07.425
You haven't learned shit.
Take it. I'm done.


1293
01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.385
- Be safe, Luis! Be safe!
- Mom!


1294
01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:10.928
We need light over here!

1295
01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:13.139
- Cara!
- Cara, honey, can you hear us?


1296
01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:16.017
- Mom!
- Cara?


1297
01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:18.603
Can we move faster?
She's taken her to the mill.


1298
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.813
- We have to go.
- Get that light up here.


1299
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.482
I'm coming,
I'm coming. Cara?


1300
01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.567
Shh! Hear anything? Quiet.

1301
01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:28.154
I hear the river.
Let's move.


1302
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.947
Sarah, hold up.

1303
01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.824
Mom!

1304
01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.077
Hey, Mia,
shine your light to the right.


1305
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.371
What's that?

1306
01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:38.081
Oh, my God. That's...

1307
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.541
Is that the River Rouge
from the documentary?


1308
01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:50.176
- What the fuck was that?
- Shh!


1309
01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:52.053
Mia, keep the light up.

1310
01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:06.234
There's blood, footprints.

1311
01:14:06.401 --> 01:14:07.860
I know it's your mom,

1312
01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.570
but whatever this is,
it's not your mom.


1313
01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:11.197
- No, Tweedy...
- You stay here.


1314
01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.074
I'm gonna bring her out,
alright?


1315
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.576
- I'm gonna bring her out.
- Be careful, OK?


1316
01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:25.837
- Are you OK?
- Sarah, I lied.


1317
01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:28.089
In the beginning I lied.
I lied about my grandfather.


1318
01:14:28.256 --> 01:14:29.966
I don't give a shit.
You're here now.


1319
01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.009
Cara?

1320
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.724
Cara, honey?

1321
01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.562
Cara, where are you?

1322
01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:45.857
Can you see anything?

1323
01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.321
Do you see... Arggh!

1324
01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.992
Linda? Linda?

1325
01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.454
Linda! Linda!

1326
01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.749
We're here! Linda?

1327
01:15:16.471 --> 01:15:18.389
Sarah?

1328
01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.808
Do you see anything?

1329
01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:25.104
Linda, where are you?
Can you hear me?


1330
01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:26.898
Come on.

1331
01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:32.403
No!

1332
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:35.156
No! Mom!

1333
01:15:35.323 --> 01:15:37.283
Mom!

1334
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:39.494
Which way? Which way?

1335
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.747
- Sarah, I'm coming!
- Mom!


1336
01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:46.709
Sarah! I'm following you!
Where are you?!


1337
01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:49.921
Sarah! Oh, my God.
This is fucking ludicrous.


1338
01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.089
We're never gonna be able
to get out of here.


1339
01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.342
Mia, calm down.
I need you to keep calm.


1340
01:15:54.509 --> 01:15:56.511
We're gonna get lost
and we're never gonna get out.


1341
01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:59.305
What? What's wrong
with the light?


1342
01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:01.516
OK, Mia,
I'm gonna give you this...


1343
01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:03.476
- Oh, my God.
- OK? Calm down.


1344
01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:06.229
- You can do it.
- Give me the camera!


1345
01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:09.273
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes, yes, yes! OK, got it.


1346
01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:12.652
Sarah?

1347
01:16:12.819 --> 01:16:15.196
Sarah!

1348
01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:21.118
I'm coming! Where are you?

1349
01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:23.079
Don't leave me, Sarah.
Don't leave me!


1350
01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:25.540
Over here!

1351
01:16:25.706 --> 01:16:27.792
They're in there.

1352
01:16:27.959 --> 01:16:30.711
Sarah, no, no!

1353
01:16:32.547 --> 01:16:34.257
- She's gonna die. Give me!
- No, no...


1354
01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.342
Then I'll go. Give me
the fucking light.


1355
01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.556
Don't touch anything.
This shit will collapse.


1356
01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:43.307
Fuck, fuck!

1357
01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:46.102
In there.

1358
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.982
Ugh!

1359
01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:52.984
Ugh!

1360
01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:54.610
Here. Take the light. Here.

1361
01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:02.535
Oh, fuck. Go fuck yourself!

1362
01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:06.914
- OK.
- Sarah?


1363
01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:09.625
- Just keep going.
- I can't do this!


1364
01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:12.169
Get...get off of me!

1365
01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:15.047
Shh, shh. It's OK.
Just stay near me.


1366
01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:19.468
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna sedate her.


1367
01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.721
I'm gonna jab her
if I can get it in


1368
01:17:21.888 --> 01:17:24.140
and then she'll be out,
he'll be weakened, right?


1369
01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:25.933
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.


1370
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.185
Then we can burn the remains
just like Schiffer said.


1371
01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:30.146
- It'll be done, alright?
- Oh, my God...


1372
01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:31.981
You grab Cara, OK?

1373
01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:33.733
Gather yourself.

1374
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.610
We gotta shut this off.

1375
01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:37.403
She's gonna...
she's gonna see us.


1376
01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:40.156
- I don't wanna do it.
- I can do this.


1377
01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:43.326
Thank you, thank you. OK.

1378
01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:55.254
Come on.

1379
01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:34.126
Get off, Ma!

1380
01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.133
Holy shit...

1381
01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:44.136
- Are you OK? Are you OK?
- Oh, my God.


1382
01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:46.305
Come on. Cara?

1383
01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:49.016
- Cara?
- What do we do?


1384
01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:51.435
Cara!

1385
01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:57.650
Cara?

1386
01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:01.946
Mom?

1387
01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:13.582
Mom?

1388
01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:22.008
No, no, no...

1389
01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:25.052
Oh, what's that?

1390
01:19:25.219 --> 01:19:26.887
What's that?

1391
01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.640
Fuck! It slipped.

1392
01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:31.517
Shh. Shut up.

1393
01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:34.603
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know...


1394
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.397
Come on.

1395
01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.524
Come on.

1396
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:47.324
Come around here, OK? Ma?

1397
01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:51.620
- OK...
- No, Sarah. Don't.


1398
01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:55.082
OK, OK, Ma. Here I come.

1399
01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:01.380
Oh...

1400
01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:04.633
Ohh!

1401
01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:14.727
Wait! No!

1402
01:20:14.894 --> 01:20:17.271
Mom, Mom! Fight him, Mom!

1403
01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:19.356
Fight him!

1404
01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:22.068
It's Sarah!

1405
01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.111
It's Sarah!

1406
01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:27.114
Mom! You can fight him!

1407
01:20:27.281 --> 01:20:29.867
Fight him, Mom!
Fight him! Fight him!


1408
01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:33.746
Sarah...

1409
01:20:33.913 --> 01:20:36.207
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1410
01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:38.417
Ma...

1411
01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:48.636
No, No! Mom!

1412
01:20:57.937 --> 01:21:00.314
Cara, Cara, come here.
Come on, come on.


1413
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.233
Mia, come here.

1414
01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:04.652
Take Cara, OK?
Keep her behind you.


1415
01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.287
OK, Ma, let's get rid
of this motherfucker


1416
01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:17.164
right now, you and me, OK?

1417
01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.669
But we've
tried this before.


1418
01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:23.712
Not here, right, Ma?

1419
01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.215
Fuck. There it goes.

1420
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.969
Arggh!

1421
01:21:37.685 --> 01:21:39.937
Oh, shit!

1422
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.152
Mom?

1423
01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:48.696
Mom?

1424
01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:51.365
- Sarah...
- Yeah?


1425
01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:56.537
- Yeah, Ma?
- Sarah...


1426
01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:58.497
Yeah, Ma.

1427
01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:06.130
Oh, she's burnt.

1428
01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:08.591
Jesus...

1429
01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.509
Are you OK?

1430
01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.574
..reportedly abducted Cara Minetti

1431
01:22:33.741 --> 01:22:35.618
from Exuma Hospital

1432
01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.204
and led local authorities
on a grisly chase...


1433
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.080
..cancer patient Cara Minetti
is resting comfortably


1434
01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:41.957
at Exuma General tonight

1435
01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:43.834
after a harrowing
kidnapping ordeal


1436
01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:46.629
that led to the death
of a Monacan County sheriff


1437
01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.839
as well as numerous
life-threatening injuries


1438
01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:51.550
to local law enforcement
and hospital staff.


1439
01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:53.510
..outside the Exuma
County Courthouse


1440
01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.888
where we're just now
finding out that Deborah Logan


1441
01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:58.390
was found medically unfit
to stand trial


1442
01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:00.142
for the murder
of Sheriff Linda Tweed.


1443
01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:03.354
Logan's physical condition
has deteriorated rapidly


1444
01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.148
in the months since the violent ordeal
and child abduction,


1445
01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:08.859
leaving her barely able
to speak or communicate.


1446
01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:10.819
I'm standing in front
of the Minetti house.


1447
01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.739
This is the home
of little 10-year-old Cara


1448
01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:15.616
who's celebrating
a special birthday today


1449
01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:17.534
and for good reason.

1450
01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:19.662
She's in full remission
from leukaemia


1451
01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.289
in what many are calling
a miracle.


1452
01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:25.084
- Get it, get it! Yay!
- Go, go, go, go! Yay!


1453
01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:27.753
We're celebrating
her birthday and we're moving on.


1454
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.172
- She's happy and...
- It's a celebration.


1455
01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:31.882
You rather have this
or hospital food?


1456
01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:34.301
Oh, my God. You're not
giving her that huge piece.


1457
01:23:34.468 --> 01:23:36.011
I'm tired of hospital food.

1458
01:23:38.973 --> 01:23:41.558
What are you
looking forward to doing


1459
01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.435
in your ripe old age?

1460
01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:46.063
- I don't know.
- You don't know?


1461
01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:50.359
- No.
- Well, you better make a plan.


1462
01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:52.236
I have one.

1463
01:23:52.403 --> 01:23:54.196
You do? What is it?

1464
01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:56.282
- It's a secret.
- Oh. Hah!


1465
01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:58.242
Well, thank you for letting us

1466
01:23:58.409 --> 01:24:00.119
come to your
wonderful party, honey.


1467
01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:02.079
You're welcome.

1468
01:24:02.246 --> 01:24:04.415
You're looking at
the healthy and happy face


1469
01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:07.001
of a remarkable

1470
01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:11.714
It's an unbelievable story
with such a happy ending.
