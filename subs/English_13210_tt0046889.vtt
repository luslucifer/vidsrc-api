1
00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:08.957
I can't find it, Daddy.
I've looked everywhere.


2
00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:11.460
All right, don't worry.
We'll find it in the morning.


3
00:02:11.593 --> 00:02:13.175
I've got another one here.

4
00:02:13.302 --> 00:02:14.884
Ready?

5
00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:20.504
Stand by.

6
00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:25.254
Four, three, two, one, fire!

7
00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:27.001
Oh, I'm sorry.
No good.


8
00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:28.876
It's over there in that flower bed
somewhere.


9
00:02:30.177 --> 00:02:33.295
- I've lost it, Daddy. I can't find it.
- I've got it.


10
00:02:34.468 --> 00:02:37.256
- Here it is, Daddy.
- Thank you.


11
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.797
Watch it, Christopher.

12
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.084
Four, three, two, one, fire!

13
00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:51.632
Fine, that's good!
Mark it, Mary.


14
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:58.668
Right, well let's...

15
00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:01.169
Hello, Doc! I'm sorry.
Have you been here long?


16
00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:03.339
No, I've just come.
What's all this going on?


17
00:03:03.468 --> 00:03:05.710
Oh, it's... just a little thing
I'm trying to find out. Look, here.


18
00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:09.336
I wonder if you'll just hold that for me.
Just over the centre of the tub.


19
00:03:10.552 --> 00:03:12.009
Got it?

20
00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:14.627
Right, we'll make a note of this one.

21
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.594
13 foot 3. That's all right now.
Thank you very much.


22
00:03:17.718 --> 00:03:19.084
- Hello, Doc.
- Hello, darling.


23
00:03:19.218 --> 00:03:21.631
Are you going to look at Elizabeth now?
I hope it isn't tonsils.


24
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.218
- She looks all right. Where's your mother?
- In the house.


25
00:03:24.343 --> 00:03:25.925
- Let's go in, shall we?
- I'll be in in a minute.


26
00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:27.668
- Stay and have some tea.
- Thanks very much.


27
00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:31.716
Well, now listen. Let's try and get
one or two more shots before it's too dark.


28
00:03:32.593 --> 00:03:34.209
Thank you.

29
00:03:34.343 --> 00:03:36.005
Watch out, Mary.

30
00:03:36.135 --> 00:03:37.876
Watch it, Christopher.

31
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.253
I don't think there's anything
to worry about here.


32
00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:43.001
Temperature's all right.

33
00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:45.172
Quite a lot of these throats
running around this spring.


34
00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:47.043
I expect you'll find she'll be all right
in the morning.


35
00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:50.625
Good. Now, run along to bed, darling,
and I'll bring you up some supper later on.


36
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.752
Oh, but I've got to help Daddy
play marbles.


37
00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:54.376
No, it's too late now, dear.

38
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.342
- Goodnight, Doctor.
- Goodnight, Elizabeth.


39
00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.801
All right, let's try once more.

40
00:03:58.927 --> 00:04:00.793
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, darling.


41
00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:03.010
...three, two, one, fire!

42
00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:06.207
He seems to be having
a fine old game out there.


43
00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:08.334
What's it all about?

44
00:04:08.468 --> 00:04:11.085
Just some problem he's trying to solve
before tomorrow afternoon.


45
00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:12.675
He's been at it for days now.

46
00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:15.215
He was out there at five o'clock
this morning in the rain.


47
00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:18.711
Doctor, when I called you this afternoon,
it wasn't really about Elizabeth.


48
00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:20.880
- It was Barnes.
- You don't think he's well?


49
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.798
Oh, he's all right at present,
but he won't be for much longer.


50
00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:25.634
He can't be if
he goes on like this:

51
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.093
two and three and four o'clock
night after night.


52
00:04:28.218 --> 00:04:30.426
And after a hard day
at his real job at Vickers.


53
00:04:30.552 --> 00:04:34.045
He hardly went to bed at all last night.
He's wearing himself out.


54
00:04:34.177 --> 00:04:37.500
I wish you'd have a talk with him,
I think he might listen to you.


55
00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:39.627
I'll see what I can do,
but you know how he is.


56
00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:43.465
- How is Elizabeth?
- Oh, she's all right.


57
00:04:43.593 --> 00:04:45.255
- You don't think it's tonsils?
- No, no, no, no.


58
00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.628
But I'll keep an eye on her,
don't you worry.


59
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.796
Ah!

60
00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:52.135
Tea's stone cold, Barnes.
I called you twice.


61
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.378
Oh, I'm sorry. But you know
I got a lot of very useful stuff here.


62
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.593
It's only a question now
of working it out on paper.


63
00:04:57.718 --> 00:05:00.506
- Another late night?
- Oh, I don't know, it depends.


64
00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:03.469
In any case, this part's easy
compared with what's coming.


65
00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:05.550
- Have a cup of tea, Doc.
- Well, if you're going to...


66
00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:07.634
- I'll make some fresh.
- Don't worry, I'll do it.


67
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.719
No, no, no. Do sit down
and take off those wet shoes.


68
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.048
- Better see to the blackout first.
- I'll give you a hand.


69
00:05:19.427 --> 00:05:20.963
Wait a sec.

70
00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:25.260
Come out here and listen.

71
00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:33.085
Hmm, sounds like another big one.

72
00:05:33.218 --> 00:05:35.710
Surely they won't be able to stand up
to many raids like these.


73
00:05:35.843 --> 00:05:38.677
They wouldn't if we could really
get at them, but we don't.


74
00:05:38.802 --> 00:05:41.670
It's like trying to kill a giant
by firing at his arms and legs


75
00:05:41.802 --> 00:05:45.716
with thousands of peashooters
instead of a clean bullet through the heart.


76
00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:49.927
You know what happened
when they tried to wipe out London.


77
00:05:50.052 --> 00:05:52.339
Here's your tea, Barnes.
Don't let this get cold.


78
00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:54.050
I'm coming.

79
00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:09.634
Doc, do you remember the night I told you
about that earthquake bomb idea of mine?


80
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.968
Yes, that was the time of Dunkerque.

81
00:06:12.093 --> 00:06:15.006
You told me the idea,
but not what you wanted it for.


82
00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:18.089
Come over here.

83
00:06:22.427 --> 00:06:25.340
Do you know how much water it takes
the Germans to make a ton of steel?


84
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.711
- Haven't the least idea.
- One hundred tons.


85
00:06:28.843 --> 00:06:30.129
Now just look at this.

86
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.424
The whole of this great arsenal
of war factories in the Ruhr


87
00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:36.545
depends for its water
on three enormous dams:


88
00:06:36.677 --> 00:06:39.875
Möhne, Eder and the Sorpe.

89
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.924
They control the level of the canals
and supply a lot of hydroelectric power.


90
00:06:44.052 --> 00:06:49.218
When those are full,
they hold 400 million tons of water.


91
00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:52.882
Just think of the chaos
if we could break those walls down.


92
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.218
Now, this is what I wanted to do.

93
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.753
Drop a 10-ton bomb
from 40,000 feet


94
00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:04.300
that would seal itself
in the roots of the wall.


95
00:07:04.427 --> 00:07:07.010
The shockwaves would be tremendous,
a real earthquake.


96
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.297
But could you hit a target that size
from eight miles up?


97
00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:12.261
I reckon that a near miss, even 50 feet,
would do the job.


98
00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:14.502
Is there an airplane that will carry
a 10-ton bomb?


99
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:17.093
- No, but I was going to design one.
- What happened?


100
00:07:17.218 --> 00:07:19.551
Well, a committee was set up
and we went into it,


101
00:07:19.677 --> 00:07:21.043
but in the end I discovered

102
00:07:21.177 --> 00:07:23.965
I hadn't made sufficient allowance
for the cushioning effect of the water.


103
00:07:24.093 --> 00:07:25.334
We should need a 30-ton bomb,

104
00:07:25.468 --> 00:07:27.755
and that's too heavy for any aircraft
we can produce at present.


105
00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:28.966
- Sugar?
- No, thanks.


106
00:07:29.093 --> 00:07:31.460
- Oh, carry on.
- Well, just a little.


107
00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:33.004
Do you know, Barnes,

108
00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:37.049
I still don't see why you need
such a special bomb.


109
00:07:37.177 --> 00:07:39.009
Look.

110
00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:43.709
This dam is about 120 feet thick -
solid masonry all through.


111
00:07:43.843 --> 00:07:47.587
We've just proved that a bomb 20 times
the size of the biggest bomb now in use


112
00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:49.254
wouldn't even tickle it.

113
00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.297
Besides, we can't float anything
down the lake


114
00:07:51.427 --> 00:07:55.046
because they've got these two huge booms
stretching right across it.


115
00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:56.713
We can't even get it in
under the water


116
00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:59.677
because these booms
support thick steel nets


117
00:07:59.802 --> 00:08:03.466
which would stop a flotilla of submarines,
let alone torpedoes.


118
00:08:03.593 --> 00:08:05.129
I see.

119
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.094
You can't bomb it,
you can't float a mine against it,


120
00:08:08.218 --> 00:08:10.084
you can't torpedo it.

121
00:08:10.218 --> 00:08:13.711
- Looks impossible.
- Yes, it does, doesn't it?


122
00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:17.336
The other day, I thought of a new...
a wonderful idea.


123
00:08:17.468 --> 00:08:19.960
- You've found a way to do it?
- Well, I think so.


124
00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:23.131
The only trouble is that the committee
that's enquiring into my original idea


125
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.001
is meeting again tomorrow and, er...

126
00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:27.502
I rather expect they'll want
to wind the whole thing up.


127
00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:29.217
Well, if they do, I'm done.

128
00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:31.630
Why not go ahead with your new idea
until you're ready


129
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.752
and then get them
to form a new committee?


130
00:08:33.885 --> 00:08:37.299
My dear fellow, you talk as if I could
pull committees out of a hat.


131
00:08:37.427 --> 00:08:41.671
It took months... well, years almost
to get Whitehall to start this one.


132
00:08:41.802 --> 00:08:46.046
No, somehow or other I must
keep it alive until I'm ready.


133
00:08:48.927 --> 00:08:52.250
Oh, I'm sorry!
You want to get back to your surgery.


134
00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:54.251
Well, I ought to really.

135
00:08:58.093 --> 00:09:00.005
- Barnes.
- Hmm?


136
00:09:00.135 --> 00:09:04.004
- Will you promise me something?
- If I can...


137
00:09:04.135 --> 00:09:07.958
Would you try to get away for Easter?
You do need a rest, you know?


138
00:09:08.093 --> 00:09:10.881
You think I'm going crazy?
A lot of people do, you know?


139
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.924
No, but you can't go on day and night.
Nobody can.


140
00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:17.467
All right, Doc.

141
00:09:31.843 --> 00:09:33.550
- Hello, Dr Pye.
- Hello, Wallis.


142
00:09:33.677 --> 00:09:35.760
- Would you do something for me?
- I'll try.


143
00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:37.968
You've got a lot of influence
over those fellows in there.


144
00:09:38.093 --> 00:09:41.006
Will you try to stop them
winding the thing up right away?


145
00:09:41.135 --> 00:09:44.299
- They'd need a very convincing reason.
- I've got a new idea.


146
00:09:44.427 --> 00:09:47.386
It's quite different,
only... I must have time.


147
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.674
- Can you explain to them what it is?
- That's just the point, I can't.


148
00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:53.874
If I were to try explain it to them now,
they'd only laugh at me.


149
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.922
It's very difficult
without knowing more about it.


150
00:09:56.052 --> 00:09:57.839
Yes, I do see that, but...

151
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.967
We'd better go in.

152
00:10:03.218 --> 00:10:06.711
Surely Mr Wallis must realise
the false position he's putting us into.


153
00:10:06.843 --> 00:10:09.176
We were appointed to examine
a definite proposition.


154
00:10:09.302 --> 00:10:12.090
I don't think we were confined
to any definite proposition.


155
00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:15.416
We were appointed to examine every
possibility of air attack on these dams.


156
00:10:15.552 --> 00:10:18.090
I know, but Mr Wallis
did put forward a theory


157
00:10:18.218 --> 00:10:20.301
that was hopelessly wide off the mark.

158
00:10:20.427 --> 00:10:21.963
And on the strength of this,

159
00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:25.586
he now asks for time
to explore a completely new theory


160
00:10:25.718 --> 00:10:27.630
that's too fantastic even to explain.

161
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.798
I want you to give me sufficient time

162
00:10:30.927 --> 00:10:34.091
to discover how much explosive
would be needed to breach these dams


163
00:10:34.218 --> 00:10:37.086
if we could explode a bomb
directly against the wall.


164
00:10:37.218 --> 00:10:39.631
How do you propose to get the bomb
directly against the wall?


165
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.092
That is what I'm working on now.

166
00:10:41.218 --> 00:10:43.380
Yes, but surely
you can give us some idea.


167
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.002
I don't think that we can press Mr Wallis
to do that.


168
00:10:46.135 --> 00:10:49.458
If I had a partly formed theory,
I certainly shouldn't want to talk about it


169
00:10:49.593 --> 00:10:51.550
until it was clearly established
in my own mind.


170
00:10:51.677 --> 00:10:53.293
Quite so.

171
00:10:53.427 --> 00:10:56.261
How long would you need
to carry out these new experiments?


172
00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:59.628
If Glanville will let me have the model dams
at Harmondsworth again,


173
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.050
- I would say... a week or ten days.
- How do you feel about that, Glanville?


174
00:11:04.177 --> 00:11:07.136
- Only too anxious to be of any help we can.
- Right.


175
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.799
Then I should like to propose
that we formally adjourn for two weeks.


176
00:11:10.927 --> 00:11:14.125
Can I take it
that the committee agrees to this?


177
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.922
Splendid!

178
00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:24.421
I'm so glad you could come down.
I think you'll find this very interesting.


179
00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:28.125
Now, er... Glanville's people
have rigged up two charges.


180
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.675
This first one is equivalent
to a 10-ton bomb, 50 feet from the wall,


181
00:11:32.802 --> 00:11:34.213
as in the earlier experiments.

182
00:11:34.343 --> 00:11:39.293
This second one is only half that charge,
but fixed to the wall itself.


183
00:11:39.427 --> 00:11:42.170
Both are at a depth
equivalent to 30 feet.


184
00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:44.715
- Are we all ready, Collins?
- All ready, Dr Glanville.


185
00:11:44.843 --> 00:11:47.256
- You want us to take cover?
- No, I don't think so.


186
00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:49.001
Not for the first one at any rate.

187
00:11:49.135 --> 00:11:51.878
Er, do stand back over there.

188
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.965
All right, Collins, go ahead!

189
00:12:11.718 --> 00:12:14.586
There. You see?
It isn't even scratched.


190
00:12:16.343 --> 00:12:19.381
You see, a very slight shock is recorded,
and then it returns to normal.


191
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.001
Now, this is where I was wrong before.

192
00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:23.377
The cushion of water
between the explosion and the wall


193
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.378
absorbs the shock almost completely.
Shall we have the second one?


194
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.877
- When you're ready.
- This should get our feet wet.


195
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.546
Watch it.

196
00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:32.800
Fire.

197
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.629
- Good heavens! That's wonderful.
- Wonderful.


198
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.832
And that is only
half the charge of the first one.


199
00:12:45.968 --> 00:12:49.040
Do you see the difference when it's placed
hard against the wall at the right depth?


200
00:12:49.177 --> 00:12:52.045
The cushion of water now acts
in our favour, instead of against us,


201
00:12:52.177 --> 00:12:53.759
and the shockwaves
go right through the wall.


202
00:12:53.885 --> 00:12:56.423
If we use this as a basis,
Glanville and I have calculated


203
00:12:56.552 --> 00:13:00.045
we should one need 6,000 pounds
of this new explosive, RDX,


204
00:13:00.177 --> 00:13:01.418
to breach the Möhne dam itself.

205
00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:03.043
I can cut the case weight down

206
00:13:03.177 --> 00:13:05.635
and make a complete bomb
of less than five tons.


207
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.752
We shouldn't need
a specially constructed aircraft either.


208
00:13:07.885 --> 00:13:11.674
The new four-engine Lancaster can carry
a five-ton bomb right through to the Ruhr.


209
00:13:11.802 --> 00:13:14.215
- If you can make the bomb...
- Naturally.


210
00:13:14.343 --> 00:13:18.087
...and get it to explode in exactly the
right position, hard against the dam wall,


211
00:13:18.218 --> 00:13:21.177
- despite the protecting torpedo nets?
- Of course, that's the essential thing.


212
00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:22.838
But you still don't tell us how.

213
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.005
Well, if you're satisfied
with what you've seen


214
00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:27.468
and I can have the proper facilities,
I think I can do it.


215
00:13:27.593 --> 00:13:31.212
- What facilities do you want?
- A testing tank, a really big one.


216
00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:34.541
The biggest I know is the experimental
ship tank at Teddington,


217
00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:38.296
- the National Physical Laboratory's.
- Could I use one of those?


218
00:13:38.427 --> 00:13:40.293
- I'll see what we can do.
- Uh.


219
00:13:40.427 --> 00:13:42.384
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.


220
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.546
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


221
00:13:43.677 --> 00:13:45.714
- Goodbye.
- And keep at it.


222
00:13:45.843 --> 00:13:47.584
I think you've got something.

223
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.628
Three, two, one...

224
00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.921
fire!

225
00:14:01.677 --> 00:14:03.714
1-1-0, 1-3-6.

226
00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.254
Thank you.

227
00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:08.093
That's no good, it's too short.
Try 2ft 6".


228
00:14:08.218 --> 00:14:11.416
Well, gentlemen, when you asked us
to let Barnes Wallis use this tank of ours,


229
00:14:11.552 --> 00:14:13.760
I didn't expect him to be still here
after five months.


230
00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:15.171
I don't think we did either.

231
00:14:15.302 --> 00:14:17.294
We've urgent experiments
waiting for this tank.


232
00:14:17.427 --> 00:14:19.760
Has he given you the slightest idea
how long he's gonna be?


233
00:14:19.885 --> 00:14:21.296
It's making things very difficult.

234
00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:24.841
He's exploring something entirely new,
you can't hurry this kind of research.


235
00:14:24.968 --> 00:14:26.880
I know and if I thought
he was getting anywhere...


236
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.378
But he doesn't seem to be doing so.
At any rate, he doesn't tell me anything.


237
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.218
He spends hours and hours
shooting golf balls up and down.


238
00:14:33.343 --> 00:14:35.209
Every now and then,
he breaks a window.


239
00:14:35.343 --> 00:14:39.007
Look, couldn't you find him
some quiet duck pond in the country


240
00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:42.708
where he could shoot things up and down
without being a nuisance to other people?


241
00:14:42.843 --> 00:14:44.300
We'd better have a word with him.

242
00:14:44.427 --> 00:14:46.089
- Is he there now?
- He's always there.


243
00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.925
Didn't go home at all last night.

244
00:14:48.052 --> 00:14:50.385
- Why was that?
- I don't know, I expect he forgot.


245
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.627
He only has lunch
about once a week.


246
00:14:56.593 --> 00:14:59.711
All right. Stand by!
Once again.


247
00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:03.878
Three, two, one...

248
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.046
fire!

249
00:15:08.468 --> 00:15:10.004
It's OK, I got that all right.

250
00:15:10.135 --> 00:15:12.969
1-5-0, 2-0-3.

251
00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:15.301
Splendid! We'll try that again.

252
00:15:16.802 --> 00:15:19.510
Oh, hello.
Hello.


253
00:15:19.635 --> 00:15:21.376
You couldn't have come
at a better time.


254
00:15:22.635 --> 00:15:24.501
It's extraordinary
how these things happen.


255
00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:27.503
One goes on and on and feels
as if one's up against a brick wall forever,


256
00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:31.254
and then suddenly, it's as if a light
flashes on and everything slips into place.


257
00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:32.921
And now...

258
00:15:34.135 --> 00:15:36.422
If you come along here...

259
00:15:36.552 --> 00:15:39.716
I've got a camera recording,
but I think that up by the middle


260
00:15:39.843 --> 00:15:41.926
you'll see everything perfectly.

261
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.967
All right.
Er, just about where you are.


262
00:15:48.052 --> 00:15:49.259
Right. Are you all ready?

263
00:15:49.385 --> 00:15:50.796
Once again.

264
00:16:04.927 --> 00:16:06.134
Right.

265
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.003
Three, two, one...

266
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.001
fire!

267
00:16:12.968 --> 00:16:15.085
1-4-0.

268
00:16:15.218 --> 00:16:16.959
We've been trying for months
to find a rule


269
00:16:17.093 --> 00:16:19.676
by which we can fix the height
of each bounce. You see...


270
00:16:19.802 --> 00:16:21.885
If the bomb is released too soon,
it won't reach the dam,


271
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.047
if it's released too late,
it'll bounce over it


272
00:16:24.177 --> 00:16:26.544
and explode directly under the aircraft,
killing everyone.


273
00:16:26.677 --> 00:16:30.626
But now, we've got it! If you just wait here
a moment and I'll do that again.


274
00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:34.334
Right.

275
00:16:34.468 --> 00:16:37.211
Three, two, one...

276
00:16:37.343 --> 00:16:38.879
fire!

277
00:16:40.843 --> 00:16:44.257
You see? It wasn't a fluke,
it works.


278
00:16:44.385 --> 00:16:46.217
Well, that seems to be conclusive.

279
00:16:46.343 --> 00:16:49.051
You know, it's extraordinarily good of you
to have been so patient.


280
00:16:49.177 --> 00:16:50.509
Not at all, glad we could help.

281
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.048
There were times when you must've
thought I was absolutely cockeyed.


282
00:16:53.177 --> 00:16:55.669
- Oh, my dear fellow, that's the last thing...
- I shouldn't blame you if you did.


283
00:16:55.802 --> 00:16:59.591
There's such a very thin dividing line
between inspiration and obsession


284
00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:02.586
that sometimes is very hard to know
which side we're really on.


285
00:17:02.718 --> 00:17:05.176
- Will you need the tank anymore?
- If I could have it till the end of the week


286
00:17:05.302 --> 00:17:07.134
just to check my calculations
and complete the report.


287
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.422
That's perfectly all right.
You'll leave on Saturday?


288
00:17:09.552 --> 00:17:10.759
Oh, yes, definitely.

289
00:17:10.885 --> 00:17:13.878
Well, after what you've seen today,
you'll put in a satisfactory report.


290
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.093
Certainly. I think this
ought to convince the committee.


291
00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:17.254
Splendid!

292
00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:20.253
After that, it's a matter
for the Ministry of Aircraft Production.


293
00:17:20.802 --> 00:17:24.170
Under normal conditions, we should go
right ahead and give you every facility.


294
00:17:24.302 --> 00:17:26.339
But I'm afraid at the present moment,
it's quite impossible.


295
00:17:26.468 --> 00:17:28.130
But why, after that report?

296
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.593
You know how difficult things are,
Mr Wallis.


297
00:17:30.718 --> 00:17:33.882
The shipping losses -
half a million tons last month alone,


298
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.127
most of it vital war material.

299
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.968
We haven't an ounce to spare
for anything except the highest priority.


300
00:17:39.093 --> 00:17:42.666
But surely, I only want to make a few
half-size dummy prototypes of my bomb.


301
00:17:42.802 --> 00:17:45.340
A new weapon like this
would need highly skilled labour,


302
00:17:45.468 --> 00:17:47.835
special machine tools, factory space.

303
00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:50.802
Our factories are stretched
to the last inch of their capacity.


304
00:17:50.927 --> 00:17:53.010
And you know the acute shortage
of skilled labour.


305
00:17:53.135 --> 00:17:54.797
But you're making
new weapons all the time.


306
00:17:54.927 --> 00:17:57.385
We're always trying to improve
upon weapons of known value.


307
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.127
It's a different matter when we come
to revolutionary ideas,


308
00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.217
I might almost say fantastic ones,
like this.


309
00:18:03.218 --> 00:18:05.926
You mustn't think
we're unimaginative or lukewarm.


310
00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:08.089
We all see the possibilities
and we'd like to go ahead.


311
00:18:08.218 --> 00:18:10.426
But at present, I'm afraid,
it's out of the question.


312
00:18:10.552 --> 00:18:12.088
Possibly next year,
when things may be easier.


313
00:18:12.218 --> 00:18:14.676
Then, for goodness sake,
let's go as far as we can now,


314
00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:17.215
even if it doesn't go beyond
these half-size prototypes.


315
00:18:17.343 --> 00:18:19.050
You could practically make those
in a bicycle shop.


316
00:18:19.177 --> 00:18:21.339
Even if we made a few dummy bombs,

317
00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.881
you say you need a Wellington bomber
for test drops.


318
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.717
They're worth their weight in gold.

319
00:18:25.843 --> 00:18:28.426
Do you really think the authorities
would lend you one?


320
00:18:28.552 --> 00:18:31.135
What possible argument could
I put forward to get you a Wellington?


321
00:18:31.968 --> 00:18:35.257
Well, if you tell them that I designed it,
do you think that might help?


322
00:18:53.385 --> 00:18:55.502
Looks a bit choppy down there.

323
00:18:57.052 --> 00:19:00.341
Smooth or choppy,
it's all the same with this bomb, Mutt.


324
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.797
- Ready?
- Yes.


325
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.217
How's the speed, Mutt?

326
00:19:18.427 --> 00:19:20.714
Set at 180.

327
00:19:22.093 --> 00:19:23.959
Are we all right for height?

328
00:19:26.427 --> 00:19:30.876
We're all right. Bet you half a crown
it doesn't work anyhow.


329
00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:53.671
Look!

330
00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:02.342
It's all right, it works!

331
00:20:04.427 --> 00:20:05.793
Oh!

332
00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:14.176
Well, I imagine
that after the success of the trials,


333
00:20:14.302 --> 00:20:16.464
they'll let me go right ahead
with the real thing.


334
00:20:16.593 --> 00:20:18.380
Personally, I'd like to see you
go straight ahead.


335
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.127
If anything, the position's more difficult
today than it was last month.


336
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.296
How so?

337
00:20:22.427 --> 00:20:24.794
We can't even produce enough
of existing types of bombs,


338
00:20:24.927 --> 00:20:27.135
much less begin to work
on something completely new


339
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.592
and completely unpredictable.

340
00:20:28.718 --> 00:20:32.086
Surely they must realise if we can burst
those dams and flood the Ruhr valley,


341
00:20:32.218 --> 00:20:35.177
they can save the thousands of bombs
that they're dropping on the factories.


342
00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:38.875
I can only pass on to you
the decision of the Ministry, Mr Wallis.


343
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.208
It might help if you could get the support
of somebody with personal influence.


344
00:20:42.343 --> 00:20:43.959
Whom do you suggest?

345
00:20:44.093 --> 00:20:45.880
Why not go and see
Sir Edward Hughes?


346
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.501
I've seen him twice.

347
00:20:47.635 --> 00:20:51.675
- Or Sir George Burnett?
- I've seen him three times.


348
00:20:51.802 --> 00:20:54.089
Well then, of course
there's Lord Mansell.


349
00:20:54.218 --> 00:20:56.881
I sat outside his office
all yesterday morning.


350
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.967
- He was too busy.
- Oh...


351
00:20:59.093 --> 00:21:01.210
Well, why not see
Sir Geoffrey Haines?


352
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:05.212
- I sat outside his office all the afternoon.
- I see.


353
00:21:05.343 --> 00:21:09.337
Well, in that case for the present I think
you've done everything you possibly can.


354
00:21:13.593 --> 00:21:16.631
- Have you seen Mr Summers?
- I think you'll find him in the testing shed.


355
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.217
Right.

356
00:21:33.468 --> 00:21:35.460
How did you get on?

357
00:21:35.593 --> 00:21:37.505
- It's hopeless.
- What happened?


358
00:21:37.635 --> 00:21:40.252
Nothing. I walked up and down Whitehall,
in and out of offices,


359
00:21:40.385 --> 00:21:42.798
up and down stairs,
sat outside rooms, I...


360
00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:46.716
I felt like a pedlar
trying to sell clockwork toys.


361
00:21:46.843 --> 00:21:48.584
I wish there was something
I could do.


362
00:21:48.718 --> 00:21:50.459
- There is, Mutt.
- What?


363
00:21:50.593 --> 00:21:52.550
Let's take the whole thing
straight to Bomber Command.


364
00:21:52.677 --> 00:21:53.713
Harris?

365
00:21:53.843 --> 00:21:55.835
Yes. You're one of the few men
who really know him.


366
00:21:55.968 --> 00:22:00.588
If he sees the films and gets interested,
well, it'll only need one word from him.


367
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:02.921
Why not?

368
00:22:03.052 --> 00:22:05.214
There's a bit of a snag there.

369
00:22:05.343 --> 00:22:09.132
You see, he gets so inundated
with fantastic inventions...


370
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.128
That's ridiculous!
Everything he's using had to be invented.


371
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.503
Look, if you tell him that it's worthwhile,
he'll listen to you, won't he?


372
00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:20.585
I'll do what I can, but don't blame me
if he throws us both out of the window.


373
00:22:38.802 --> 00:22:40.885
Will you come in, please?

374
00:22:45.885 --> 00:22:48.093
Mr Summers
and Mr Barnes Wallis, sir.


375
00:22:48.218 --> 00:22:50.881
- Hello, Mutt. Wallis.
- Good morning.


376
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.046
What is it you want?

377
00:22:53.177 --> 00:22:55.590
I've got an idea for destroying
the Ruhr dams.


378
00:22:55.718 --> 00:22:57.550
The effect on Germany
would be enormous.


379
00:22:57.677 --> 00:23:00.340
I know all that, 
I've read the report.

380
00:23:00.468 --> 00:23:04.382
But do you really think you can knock down
a dam with that thing?


381
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.001
Yes.

382
00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:10.425
It looks clever enough on paper,
but that goes for all these wheezy ideas.


383
00:23:11.093 --> 00:23:13.961
You try to make them work,
they fall down flat.


384
00:23:14.093 --> 00:23:16.255
- This one doesn't.
- How do you know?


385
00:23:16.385 --> 00:23:19.173
We've tested it and proved it.
I've got some films here I'd like you to see.


386
00:23:19.302 --> 00:23:22.295
If you've proved the thing,
why hasn't it been taken up?


387
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.549
I don't know. But the films
only take five minutes to run.


388
00:23:26.677 --> 00:23:29.294
You could see them
and decide for yourself.


389
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.546
Well...

390
00:23:33.802 --> 00:23:34.838
All right.

391
00:23:37.302 --> 00:23:39.043
Send the projectionists
out of the room.


392
00:23:39.177 --> 00:23:42.420
If this thing is as good as you say,
there's no point in letting everybody know.


393
00:23:42.552 --> 00:23:44.714
Thornby can run the film.

394
00:23:56.343 --> 00:23:59.256
- Is that you, Barnes?
- Hello.


395
00:24:01.177 --> 00:24:04.170
It's raining a bit,
I shouldn't be surprised if it turns to snow.


396
00:24:04.302 --> 00:24:06.294
Yes, it is cold, isn't it?

397
00:24:06.427 --> 00:24:08.339
How did you get on?

398
00:24:08.468 --> 00:24:10.676
With Harris?
Oh, he was all right.


399
00:24:10.802 --> 00:24:12.759
What's he like?
Is he very fierce?


400
00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:16.925
Oh, no. He listened to what I had to say
and saw the films.


401
00:24:17.052 --> 00:24:20.671
- Was he interested?
- Yes, I think so.


402
00:24:20.802 --> 00:24:23.795
It doesn't make any difference now anyway
because the whole thing's over.


403
00:24:23.927 --> 00:24:25.668
Washed out and done with.

404
00:24:25.802 --> 00:24:28.874
That's impossible.
What happened?


405
00:24:30.718 --> 00:24:33.051
When I got back to Weybridge,
they sent for me and told me


406
00:24:33.177 --> 00:24:36.045
that the people in Whitehall had decided
that I was making a nuisance of myself,


407
00:24:36.177 --> 00:24:38.089
wasting everybody's time,
including my own,


408
00:24:38.218 --> 00:24:39.834
and that the whole thing was dropped.

409
00:24:39.968 --> 00:24:41.925
What did you do?

410
00:24:42.052 --> 00:24:44.465
Well, the only thing I could do:
I resigned.


411
00:24:44.593 --> 00:24:47.552
- Resigned? From Vickers?
- Mm-hmm.


412
00:24:47.677 --> 00:24:51.045
Surely this doesn't affect
your other work.


413
00:24:52.468 --> 00:24:57.839
Sweetheart, when you believe in a thing
as much as I have believed in this,


414
00:24:57.968 --> 00:25:00.802
there really isn't any other work
until you've seen it through.


415
00:25:01.802 --> 00:25:03.759
What will you do?

416
00:25:05.093 --> 00:25:07.801
Oh, I haven't thought about that yet.

417
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.753
It's a new experience
to find myself unemployed.


418
00:25:12.885 --> 00:25:16.504
The first thing you'll do is to have a rest.
We'll get away somewhere.


419
00:25:16.635 --> 00:25:19.594
No, I don't think so. It wouldn't be
much fun in a farm house in winter


420
00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:22.961
or in some dreary wartime hotel.

421
00:25:23.093 --> 00:25:25.631
No, there's plenty to do here, too.

422
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.504
I must see about the tool-house door,
see if I can get it to work properly.


423
00:25:30.552 --> 00:25:33.716
I've meaning to repair
the chicken run for years.


424
00:25:33.843 --> 00:25:36.586
After that, I can look around
for some way of earning a living.


425
00:25:36.718 --> 00:25:39.301
I suppose I can get a job
teaching somewhere.


426
00:25:39.427 --> 00:25:42.044
Oh, a secretary rang up
just before you got in.


427
00:25:42.177 --> 00:25:44.635
The Ministry of Aircraft Production
want to see you in the morning.


428
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.674
I've had enough of the Ministry of Aircraft
Production and all the rest of them.


429
00:25:48.802 --> 00:25:51.590
- But they said it was important.
- Yes, I dare say it is to them.


430
00:25:51.718 --> 00:25:55.166
Oh, they'd enjoy giving me a lecture
on minding my own business.


431
00:25:55.302 --> 00:25:58.136
Personally, I'd prefer to dig the garden.

432
00:26:00.218 --> 00:26:03.461
If it doesn't snow,
I think I'll put in a few broad beans.


433
00:26:03.593 --> 00:26:06.631
- Isn't it a bit too early?
- I don't know. They're very hardy.


434
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.547
One year I planted a row in November,

435
00:26:08.677 --> 00:26:11.215
and they come up a couple of inches
by Christmas.


436
00:26:12.968 --> 00:26:15.301
I think you ought to go, Barnes.

437
00:26:17.427 --> 00:26:19.794
Perhaps you're right.

438
00:26:19.927 --> 00:26:24.968
It'd be a good thing if I told them exactly
what I think of the whole bunch of them.


439
00:26:30.093 --> 00:26:31.334
Mr Wallis, sir.

440
00:26:31.468 --> 00:26:34.916
Oh, hello, Wallis. I was trying all over
the place to get hold of you yesterday.


441
00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:36.634
You needn't have troubled.

442
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.877
What do you mean,
I needn't have troubled?


443
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.797
They told me the news at Vickers.

444
00:26:40.927 --> 00:26:45.126
If you've got to tell me officially, well...
I suppose you've got to have your say.


445
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.796
Then I'll have mine.

446
00:26:46.927 --> 00:26:48.589
But they know nothing about it yet.

447
00:26:48.718 --> 00:26:50.380
The news only came through
in the afternoon.


448
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.923
Naturally, I wanted you
to be the first to know.


449
00:26:53.052 --> 00:26:55.590
- What did they tell you?
- That the whole thing was off.


450
00:26:55.718 --> 00:26:57.050
Done with, finished.

451
00:26:57.177 --> 00:27:00.249
I don't know who said that,
it didn't come from us.


452
00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.342
What I'm telling you now is official.

453
00:27:02.468 --> 00:27:04.676
Orders have just come through
from Downing Street


454
00:27:04.802 --> 00:27:06.418
that it's to go ahead right away.

455
00:27:06.552 --> 00:27:08.839
The Prime Minister
is enthusiastic about it.


456
00:27:08.968 --> 00:27:10.459
Time is the vital element now.

457
00:27:10.593 --> 00:27:14.041
The dams must be attacked early in May
when the water level is at its highest.


458
00:27:14.177 --> 00:27:15.588
After that the level begins to drop.

459
00:27:15.718 --> 00:27:17.960
Naturally, I know that.
I made it clear in my report.


460
00:27:18.093 --> 00:27:21.962
It only leaves a bare two months
to train a squadron and prepare the bombs.


461
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.843
Can you do your part in that time?

462
00:27:28.302 --> 00:27:33.297
Well... I'll do my best.

463
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.458
That's how it is. I expect you all
want to get back to your groups.


464
00:27:39.593 --> 00:27:44.839
I want a maximum effort tonight and see
if we can't get a real knock at Essen.


465
00:27:44.968 --> 00:27:46.550
Right.

466
00:27:49.635 --> 00:27:52.924
Cochrane, don't go for a minute.

467
00:27:55.427 --> 00:27:59.922
What do you think of Wallis's idea
of bursting the Ruhr dams?


468
00:28:00.052 --> 00:28:03.250
It sounds a bit far-fetched,
but personally I think it can be done.


469
00:28:03.385 --> 00:28:04.967
I hope you're right.

470
00:28:05.093 --> 00:28:09.758
Anyway, I've given it my support
and I've had orders to get ready.


471
00:28:09.885 --> 00:28:12.798
- I want you to take it on.
- Right, sir, I'd like to.


472
00:28:12.927 --> 00:28:15.465
It'll mean taking a squadron out of the line
for special training.


473
00:28:15.593 --> 00:28:18.882
No, we must form
a special squadron for this


474
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:24.176
and man it with experienced crews
who've just finished their present 30 trips.


475
00:28:24.302 --> 00:28:27.215
Some of those keen youngsters
won't mind doing an extra one.


476
00:28:27.343 --> 00:28:30.006
Have you anyone in mind
to command the squadron?


477
00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:32.377
Yes. Gibson.

478
00:29:05.968 --> 00:29:07.459
Rad shutters auto.

479
00:29:09.052 --> 00:29:11.009
Rad shutters auto.

480
00:29:15.177 --> 00:29:18.215
- Brakes off.
- Brakes off.


481
00:29:43.635 --> 00:29:46.878
Nigger, come on, boy!
Come on, Nigger!


482
00:29:47.718 --> 00:29:49.380
Come on. Come on, Nigger!

483
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.799
Come on, old fellow. You won't have
to wait for me for a long, long time.


484
00:29:52.927 --> 00:29:55.590
No, you won't!
Going on holiday, down to Cornwall.


485
00:29:55.718 --> 00:29:57.084
Rabbits. Rabbits, boy!

486
00:29:58.093 --> 00:30:00.130
Come on, Skipper,
you'll miss the bus.


487
00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.673
OK! Come on, Nigger.

488
00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:04.543
Come on, boy!

489
00:30:18.177 --> 00:30:20.260
There's a show called "Let's Face It!"
at the Hippodrome.


490
00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:22.468
- That's the Cole Porter musical.
- You've seen it?


491
00:30:22.593 --> 00:30:26.166
Yeah, I saw it last fall.
But I'll see it again.


492
00:30:26.302 --> 00:30:29.374
"Full Swing" at the Palace
with Jack Halbert.


493
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.048
Can you walk straight in on these shows
nowadays or do you have to book?


494
00:30:32.177 --> 00:30:35.090
You can't get into the stalls
because of the Americans.


495
00:30:35.218 --> 00:30:37.505
Most nights you can get in somewhere.

496
00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:39.126
There's four of us for London, Skipper.

497
00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.751
If we can get the 3:15 tomorrow,

498
00:30:40.885 --> 00:30:42.751
we might do one of the shows
before we split up.


499
00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:45.844
- You can count me in.
- We'll have a couple of taxis here at 2:30.


500
00:30:45.968 --> 00:30:48.255
Excuse me, sir. There's a message
for you from Group.


501
00:30:48.385 --> 00:30:50.468
The AOC would like to see you
at eleven o'clock tomorrow.


502
00:30:50.593 --> 00:30:53.210
Oh? Right.

503
00:31:06.427 --> 00:31:07.963
You wait there, old boy.
Stay there.


504
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.173
Wing Commander Gibson, sir.

505
00:31:19.927 --> 00:31:21.668
- Good morning, Gibson.
- Good morning, sir.


506
00:31:21.802 --> 00:31:23.634
First of all, congratulations
on the bar to your DSO.


507
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.796
Thank you, sir.

508
00:31:24.927 --> 00:31:26.839
- You finished your third tour last night?
- Yes, sir.


509
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:30.040
Would you be prepared
to take on one more trip?


510
00:31:30.177 --> 00:31:31.918
What kind of trip, sir?

511
00:31:32.052 --> 00:31:33.964
I can't tell you much about it
for the present,


512
00:31:34.093 --> 00:31:37.211
but it'll be a special one
and you'll command the operation.


513
00:31:37.343 --> 00:31:39.505
I'm afraid it would mean
putting off your leave.


514
00:31:39.635 --> 00:31:41.342
How do you feel about it?

515
00:31:41.468 --> 00:31:43.551
- All right, sir.
- Good.


516
00:31:43.677 --> 00:31:45.509
It's going to need careful training,

517
00:31:45.635 --> 00:31:48.173
and the Commander-in-Chief
wants a special squadron formed.


518
00:31:48.302 --> 00:31:50.134
It will be best
if you form it yourself.

519
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.546
I'm telling all the squadrons

520
00:31:51.677 --> 00:31:55.170
they'll have to be prepared to give up
some of their most experienced crews.


521
00:31:55.302 --> 00:31:57.385
They're not going to like it.

522
00:31:59.177 --> 00:32:01.510
- Is Group Captain Whitworth there?
- He's just arrived, sir.


523
00:32:01.635 --> 00:32:03.752
- Ask him to come in.
- Very good, sir.


524
00:32:04.927 --> 00:32:08.500
What kind of training is it to be, sir?
What sort of target?


525
00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:10.968
I can't tell you the target yet.

526
00:32:11.093 --> 00:32:13.176
But it will be low-flying.

527
00:32:13.302 --> 00:32:16.500
You've got to be able to low-fly at night
until it's second nature.


528
00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:19.293
- Hello, Whitworth.
- Good morning, sir.


529
00:32:19.427 --> 00:32:21.214
- You know each other?
- Oh, yes. We're old friends.


530
00:32:21.343 --> 00:32:22.550
- Hello, Gibson.
- Hello, sir.


531
00:32:22.677 --> 00:32:25.465
You'll be forming this squadron
at Whitworth's main base at Scampton.


532
00:32:25.593 --> 00:32:27.380
I'm sorry I can't tell you any more
at the moment,


533
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.799
but the immediate job is to get your crews
and get them flying.


534
00:32:30.927 --> 00:32:33.135
you'll have to watch security.

535
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.503
As far as others are concerned,
this is just an ordinary new squadron.


536
00:32:36.635 --> 00:32:37.671
Very good, sir.

537
00:32:37.802 --> 00:32:41.466
Now go off with Group Captain Whitworth
and he'll help you to get things going.


538
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:49.718
You'll find pretty well
everyone that matters in here, sir.


539
00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:53.883
- On this board or here, in these albums.
- Right, thank you.


540
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.343
Now then... Oh, thanks.

541
00:32:58.218 --> 00:33:00.881
I'd go for these two Australians
if I were you:


542
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.421
Les Knight and Mickey Martin.

543
00:33:02.552 --> 00:33:04.134
Martin knows all there is to know
about low-flying.


544
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.003
Yes, I met him
when he was collecting a DFC.


545
00:33:07.135 --> 00:33:10.833
I know this New Zealander, Les Munro,
I'd like to have him.


546
00:33:10.968 --> 00:33:14.416
- And Joe McCarthy, he's great.
- Oh, the American. The Glorious Blonde.


547
00:33:14.552 --> 00:33:16.965
He used to be
a Coney Island beach guard.


548
00:33:17.093 --> 00:33:19.210
We mustn't forget the English.

549
00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:24.251
Here's Bill Astell.

550
00:33:26.135 --> 00:33:28.798
Oh yes, and David Maltby.

551
00:33:30.385 --> 00:33:32.547
No, he's just started another tour.

552
00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.384
And Hoppy Hopgood
from my old squadron.


553
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.377
I'd like to have Dave Shannon
and Burpee from there, too.


554
00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.342
We shan't be popular
with the other squadron commanders


555
00:33:39.468 --> 00:33:41.630
if we start squeezing
chaps like these from them.


556
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.673
Henry Maudslay and Dinghy Young.

557
00:33:44.802 --> 00:33:46.634
- Do you know them?
- I know Young well.


558
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.379
I told him to fly in the Oxford University
Air squadron. He was a rowing blue.


559
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.797
Yes, Henry Maudslay's
a darn good athlete, too.


560
00:33:52.927 --> 00:33:56.125
He's a miler, I think. Yes,
you couldn't have picked two better chaps.


561
00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.503
- What about your own crew?
- They're off on leave this afternoon.


562
00:33:59.635 --> 00:34:02.002
They've had a hard tour and must be
sick of the sight of me by now.


563
00:34:02.135 --> 00:34:03.797
I'll leave them alone.

564
00:34:15.718 --> 00:34:17.380
Come on, Nigger.

565
00:34:19.468 --> 00:34:21.050
Hurry up, Skipper,
you'll miss the train.


566
00:34:21.177 --> 00:34:23.009
You fellows had better go ahead,
I shan't be coming.


567
00:34:23.135 --> 00:34:25.092
- Why? What's happened?
- Nothing much.


568
00:34:25.218 --> 00:34:27.084
- They've given me another job.
- What, a staff job?


569
00:34:27.218 --> 00:34:31.292
- No, forming a new squadron.
- What? Not before your leave?


570
00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:32.543
Yeah...

571
00:34:34.802 --> 00:34:36.384
You tell the boys, will you, Trevor?

572
00:34:37.468 --> 00:34:40.506
Well, you chaps will have to hurry
if you're going to get the 3:15.


573
00:34:52.135 --> 00:34:54.047
You needn't bother about that, Crosby.

574
00:34:54.177 --> 00:34:55.884
- I'm not going.
- Not going, sir?


575
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.082
No, but you needn't unpack everything
again because we're moving to Scampton.


576
00:34:59.218 --> 00:35:01.585
- You go and get your dinner.
- Very good, sir.


577
00:35:07.593 --> 00:35:09.960
What are messing about for?
I told you, I'm not going.


578
00:35:10.093 --> 00:35:13.757
Skipper, this new squadron...
Are you going to fly with it?


579
00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:16.753
- Of course I'm going to fly with it.
- Well, you'll need a crew, won't you?


580
00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:18.501
Of course, but I'll get one all right.

581
00:35:18.635 --> 00:35:20.922
Ooh, you mean you've had enough of us.
You want to get rid of us.


582
00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:22.668
I didn't say that.

583
00:35:22.802 --> 00:35:24.634
Well, we've just had
a committee meeting.


584
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.797
There's a general opinion
that it's not going to be safe


585
00:35:26.927 --> 00:35:30.466
to let you fly about with a lot of new people
who don't know how crazy you are.


586
00:35:30.593 --> 00:35:33.381
It's the general opinion
that you'll need us to look after you.


587
00:35:34.593 --> 00:35:38.166
Well... if that's what you want to do,
all right.


588
00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:42.091
I think you're the crazy ones.
The whole bunch of you.


589
00:36:04.927 --> 00:36:07.590
Two more beers, please.

590
00:36:10.802 --> 00:36:13.135
There's eleven DFCs already.
Three bars.


591
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.217
You can bet your boots
it's something big.


592
00:36:15.343 --> 00:36:18.632
They say it's a special squadron
to kidnap Hitler.


593
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.501
Who's that big dark fellow by the table?

594
00:36:20.635 --> 00:36:22.877
That's Young,
Gibson's second in command.


595
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.467
Dinghy Young, they call him,

596
00:36:24.593 --> 00:36:28.041
because he always comes down in the sea
and paddles home in his rubber boat.


597
00:36:28.177 --> 00:36:32.968
Oi! Here's Gibson.
He's done 173 sorties already.


598
00:36:35.468 --> 00:36:37.926
Stay there, Nigger.
Stay there, boy.


599
00:36:39.302 --> 00:36:41.840
You know most of the chaps, I think.

600
00:36:41.968 --> 00:36:43.254
All right, carry on, please.

601
00:36:43.385 --> 00:36:45.422
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Dinghy.


602
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.673
- McCarthy, sir.
- Yes, of course. Glad to have you with us.


603
00:36:48.802 --> 00:36:50.043
Hello, Maudslay.

604
00:36:50.177 --> 00:36:52.043
You two chaps are going
to be my flight commanders.


605
00:36:52.177 --> 00:36:54.339
- What's it all about, sir?
- You'll find out, sooner or later.


606
00:36:54.468 --> 00:36:57.211
- You've met Mickey Martin, haven't you?
- Yes, of course. Hello, Mickey.


607
00:36:57.343 --> 00:36:58.550
I wanted you for this.

608
00:36:58.677 --> 00:37:00.919
You're the low-flying expert.
You'll be able to tell us all about it.


609
00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:02.338
Low-flying? Fine.

610
00:37:02.468 --> 00:37:05.211
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Hoppy. Hello, Shannon.


611
00:37:05.343 --> 00:37:07.380
I found Nigger outside.
Can I stand him a beer?


612
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.093
- Don't give him more than a pint.
- Right.


613
00:37:11.468 --> 00:37:14.302
Don't drink it too quickly
or you'll get hiccups.


614
00:37:17.177 --> 00:37:19.544
Well, sir, when are we
going to get something to fly in?


615
00:37:19.677 --> 00:37:21.760
They're sending the first batch
of Lancs tomorrow.


616
00:37:39.302 --> 00:37:41.669
That makes the ten they promised us
to get started with.


617
00:37:41.802 --> 00:37:44.340
Have them flown and tested tomorrow.

618
00:37:44.468 --> 00:37:48.166
We can begin this afternoon
dividing the crews into flights.


619
00:37:48.302 --> 00:37:51.170
The first job will be to fly over
every big lake in England and Wales


620
00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:53.214
- and photograph them.
- Lakes?


621
00:37:53.343 --> 00:37:54.459
Lakes.

622
00:37:54.593 --> 00:37:57.711
- The crews are in the briefing room, sir.
- All right, I'll come.


623
00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:18.669
Right, you can sit down.

624
00:38:23.385 --> 00:38:27.049
Well, here we are all together
for the first time.


625
00:38:27.177 --> 00:38:28.418
You're wondering what it's all about,

626
00:38:28.552 --> 00:38:31.511
and I can't tell you
because I don't know myself.


627
00:38:31.635 --> 00:38:33.217
But I do know it's a big thing.

628
00:38:33.843 --> 00:38:38.008
And if it comes off, it will have results
that may do quite a bit to shorten this war.


629
00:38:38.968 --> 00:38:41.005
Discipline is going to be essential.

630
00:38:41.135 --> 00:38:42.751
So is security.

631
00:38:42.885 --> 00:38:45.753
It's unusual for a crowd like you
to be formed into a new squadron,


632
00:38:45.885 --> 00:38:48.218
so you're going to be talked about.

633
00:38:48.343 --> 00:38:50.676
Rumours are flying about already,

634
00:38:50.802 --> 00:38:52.919
but you've got
to keep your mouths shut!


635
00:38:55.385 --> 00:38:58.503
Everything depends on secrecy
in a show like this.


636
00:38:58.635 --> 00:39:01.469
If we can surprise them,
then we'll play hell with them.


637
00:39:02.218 --> 00:39:04.210
But if they're ready for us,

638
00:39:04.343 --> 00:39:07.256
then the hell's gonna come
from the other side.


639
00:39:07.968 --> 00:39:11.666
Now I understand that the job,
whatever it is,


640
00:39:11.802 --> 00:39:13.759
has got to be done at low level.

641
00:39:17.052 --> 00:39:19.510
So the first thing
is to practise low-flying


642
00:39:19.635 --> 00:39:22.503
day and night until we can do it
with our eyes shut.


643
00:40:00.427 --> 00:40:01.918
Come in.

644
00:40:03.677 --> 00:40:05.885
- Hello, Mutt.
- This is Wing Commander Guy Gibson.


645
00:40:07.135 --> 00:40:09.377
Oh, good morning.
I'm glad you've come.


646
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.627
- My name is Barnes Wallis.
- Morning, sir.


647
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.592
Well, I'll leave you to it.
See you later.


648
00:40:13.718 --> 00:40:15.675
- Right. Thanks.
- Thanks a lot, Mutt.


649
00:40:15.802 --> 00:40:18.044
Would you like to put those things down?
Give me that.


650
00:40:18.177 --> 00:40:19.713
Thank you.

651
00:40:20.968 --> 00:40:23.460
I don't smoke, but there's sometimes
a cigarette in here.


652
00:40:23.593 --> 00:40:25.459
- Yes, there we are.
- Thank you.


653
00:40:27.843 --> 00:40:31.416
Well, I don't suppose you know
very much about all this at present.


654
00:40:31.552 --> 00:40:33.384
I don't know anything
about anything yet.


655
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.172
But you know the target.

656
00:40:35.302 --> 00:40:37.464
No, not the faintest idea.

657
00:40:37.593 --> 00:40:39.084
My dear boy...

658
00:40:39.218 --> 00:40:41.426
Well, I thought
they would have told you.


659
00:40:41.552 --> 00:40:42.918
This makes it very awkward.

660
00:40:43.052 --> 00:40:44.884
Isn't that what I've come here for,
to be told by you?


661
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.878
Oh no, not the target.
That's dreadfully secret.


662
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.833
I'm afraid I can't tell anybody
whose name isn't on this list.


663
00:40:51.968 --> 00:40:55.632
Still, I'll tell you
as much as I dare.

664
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.128
Well you see, there are certain objects
in the enemy territory


665
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.129
that are very big and quite vital
to this war effort.


666
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.378
They're so big that ordinary bombs
won't hurt them.


667
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:09.799
But I've got an idea
for a special type of bomb,


668
00:41:09.927 --> 00:41:12.294
only it would have to be dropped
at very low level.


669
00:41:12.427 --> 00:41:14.419
Oh, they've told us about low-flying.

670
00:41:14.552 --> 00:41:16.635
Oh, they have?
Oh, well that's something.


671
00:41:18.093 --> 00:41:20.631
Well, I don't know
if you're scientifically minded...


672
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.343
In any case, it wouldn't be necessary
for you or any of your crews


673
00:41:23.468 --> 00:41:25.425
to understand the theory
and mathematics of the weapon.


674
00:41:25.552 --> 00:41:27.384
I'd like to try and
understand it if I can.

675
00:41:28.468 --> 00:41:30.551
You would?
Oh, splendid.


676
00:41:30.677 --> 00:41:33.044
Well, I'll explain it all to you later
on paper.


677
00:41:33.177 --> 00:41:35.169
But first of all,
I'd like you to see some films.


678
00:41:35.302 --> 00:41:38.215
You can leave your things here,
it's only in the next room.


679
00:41:38.343 --> 00:41:39.800
Ready?

680
00:41:45.343 --> 00:41:47.209
Right, this way.

681
00:41:47.343 --> 00:41:49.551
- Er, are you ready?
- Yes, sir.


682
00:41:49.677 --> 00:41:52.135
Bring up a couple of chairs.

683
00:41:59.302 --> 00:42:00.588
Right.

684
00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:04.507
Now these are the first dropping tests
at Chesil Beach, near Weymouth.


685
00:42:05.552 --> 00:42:07.635
Here comes the Wellington.

686
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.299
Mutt Summers is the pilot
and I'm working the release gear.


687
00:42:12.635 --> 00:42:14.171
Now in a moment, you'll see the bomb.

688
00:42:15.635 --> 00:42:18.469
There it goes... Now watch.

689
00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:38.045
Now we switch to one of the big
testing tanks at Teddington.


690
00:42:38.177 --> 00:42:41.625
These pictures were taken much earlier,
when I was experimenting with miniatures,


691
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.423
but they show
what the bomb does underwater.


692
00:42:44.552 --> 00:42:45.668
There it goes.

693
00:42:49.885 --> 00:42:52.844
Now that's exactly
how a full-size bomb would behave.


694
00:42:52.968 --> 00:42:57.668
At 30 feet down, an hydrostatic pistol
would automatically explode the charge.


695
00:43:01.302 --> 00:43:04.841
Well, you can see now
why this low-flying is so important.


696
00:43:04.968 --> 00:43:06.960
Each aircraft will only be able
to carry one bomb,


697
00:43:07.093 --> 00:43:11.588
and it must be dropped from exactly

698
00:43:11.718 --> 00:43:15.962
Above or below that height and speed
and it just doesn't work.


699
00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.755
Take a chair, won't you?

700
00:43:18.593 --> 00:43:20.505
Yes, I'm sorry, we're tied so closely,

701
00:43:20.635 --> 00:43:24.083
but... well, you see, it's all a question
of gravity and mathematics.


702
00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:29.708
I'm afraid I'm asking a great deal of you.
Do you think you can fly it to those limits?


703
00:43:31.135 --> 00:43:33.218
Well, it's hard to say off hand.

704
00:43:33.343 --> 00:43:35.505
The altimeter's no good
at that level,


705
00:43:35.635 --> 00:43:37.718
but they've given me
some of the best pilots in the Air Force


706
00:43:37.843 --> 00:43:39.675
so we'll see what we can do.

707
00:43:39.802 --> 00:43:41.839
You haven't tested the full-size bomb yet,
have you?


708
00:43:41.968 --> 00:43:44.460
No, it's being assembled now.
I hope to try it in a week or ten days.


709
00:43:45.177 --> 00:43:47.134
Do you really mean
that a five-ton bomb


710
00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.377
can bounce along the water
like a ping-pong ball?


711
00:43:50.468 --> 00:43:52.801
It's been hard to persuade some people
that it will,


712
00:43:52.927 --> 00:43:55.840
but I've every reason to believe
it will behave exactly like those miniatures.


713
00:43:55.968 --> 00:43:58.176
How far from the target
do we drop the bomb?


714
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:03.880
Ah, that's the third factor that I'm afraid
requires absolute accuracy.


715
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:08.209
I've got a little more work to do on it,
but I think it'll be 600 yards.


716
00:44:08.343 --> 00:44:11.507
Did you invent this thing
out of your own head?


717
00:44:11.635 --> 00:44:15.003
Well... yes...
I think I may say I invented it.


718
00:44:15.927 --> 00:44:17.259
Well, I think it's terrific.

719
00:44:18.427 --> 00:44:20.259
I thought so at one time, but...

720
00:44:20.385 --> 00:44:22.752
I'm beginning to think
that the job of inventing it was small


721
00:44:22.885 --> 00:44:24.251
compared with the job of dropping it.

722
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.047
Well, we'll do our best.

723
00:44:27.177 --> 00:44:29.715
I'm talking right in the dark at present.

724
00:44:29.843 --> 00:44:31.300
If only I knew what the target was.

725
00:44:33.302 --> 00:44:36.875
Yes... Well, I've told you
as much as I dare.


726
00:44:37.635 --> 00:44:39.797
I hope they'll tell you the rest
when you get back.


727
00:44:40.677 --> 00:44:42.339
Well, Gibson, there it is.

728
00:44:42.468 --> 00:44:45.506
That's your main target,
the Möhne dam.


729
00:44:45.635 --> 00:44:48.673
So that's it.
I thought it was going to be the Tirpitz.


730
00:44:48.802 --> 00:44:50.259
If you can blow
a hole in this wall,

731
00:44:50.385 --> 00:44:53.378
you'll bring the Ruhr steel industry
to a standstill


732
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.593
and do much other damage besides.

733
00:44:55.718 --> 00:44:56.834
I'm showing you the targets,

734
00:44:56.968 --> 00:44:59.551
but you'll be the only man in the squadron
who knows, so... keep it that way.


735
00:44:59.677 --> 00:45:00.713
Very good, sir.

736
00:45:00.843 --> 00:45:04.507
These are the models of the two
other dams: the Eder and the Sorpe.


737
00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.752
- But the Möhne is the most important.
- I see, sir.


738
00:45:06.885 --> 00:45:08.842
Come along and study these
as often as you like.


739
00:45:08.968 --> 00:45:11.460
We're having regular reconnaissance
to see what they're doing over there


740
00:45:11.593 --> 00:45:13.300
and watch the height of the water.

741
00:45:13.427 --> 00:45:15.840
The operation must be carried out
when the lakes are full.


742
00:45:15.968 --> 00:45:17.675
When's that likely to be, sir?

743
00:45:17.802 --> 00:45:20.590
About the middle of May.
We'll need a good moon as well,


744
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:24.712
so it looks as though we're tied
to a night between the 12th and 17th.


745
00:45:24.843 --> 00:45:26.584
By the time the next full moon
comes around,


746
00:45:26.718 --> 00:45:28.300
the water level
will have started to fall again


747
00:45:28.427 --> 00:45:31.841
so that's our only chance this year,
about five weeks from now.


748
00:45:32.677 --> 00:45:34.088
How's the training going?

749
00:45:34.218 --> 00:45:36.130
Pretty well, sir.
Except for the low-flying.


750
00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.877
- I guessed you'd be in trouble over that.
- It's fairly easy by day,


751
00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.878
but night-flying over water at 150 feet
is pretty near impossible.


752
00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.673
- You can't trust your altimeters?
- Not at the limits that Mr Wallis wants.


753
00:45:44.802 --> 00:45:48.091
He insists on a 150 feet,
not a foot below or a foot above.


754
00:45:48.218 --> 00:45:50.301
I'd hoped we could
get over it by practice,

755
00:45:50.427 --> 00:45:52.009
but on still nights,
when the water is smooth,


756
00:45:52.135 --> 00:45:54.843
there's a sort of no-man's-land
between the dusk and the water.


757
00:45:54.968 --> 00:45:58.882
I've got the Farnborough experts on that.
I hope they'll come along with an idea.


758
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.548
By the way, Wallis is going to test
the full-size bomb at Reculver tomorrow.


759
00:46:01.677 --> 00:46:03.134
I'd like you to go down and watch.

760
00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.377
- Take your bombing leader with you.
- Right, sir.


761
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.548
Can I see your passes, please?

762
00:46:12.093 --> 00:46:13.129
Thank you.

763
00:46:27.343 --> 00:46:29.050
- Hello, Gibson.
- Hello, sir.


764
00:46:29.177 --> 00:46:31.214
This is Bob Hay,
my bombing leader.


765
00:46:31.343 --> 00:46:34.666
I'm sorry to drag you here so early.
We had to catch the high tide.


766
00:46:34.802 --> 00:46:36.088
It goes right out here,

767
00:46:36.218 --> 00:46:38.460
so when it's low, we can wade in
and find the bombs


768
00:46:38.593 --> 00:46:40.255
and see how they stand up
to the shock of impact.


769
00:46:40.385 --> 00:46:42.547
- Have you started yet?
- Oh, yes, we've dropped two already.


770
00:46:42.677 --> 00:46:43.963
How did they go?

771
00:46:44.093 --> 00:46:46.585
Erm, not too well,
I'm afraid the casing broke.


772
00:46:46.718 --> 00:46:48.254
We're testing another.

773
00:46:48.385 --> 00:46:50.718
Well, they're due now, any minute.

774
00:46:58.718 --> 00:47:00.300
Here it comes.

775
00:47:21.218 --> 00:47:22.629
It's broken again.

776
00:47:26.593 --> 00:47:28.835
I'm sorry to bring you all the way here
to see that.


777
00:47:28.968 --> 00:47:31.460
There's no need to worry,
I'll get it right.


778
00:47:32.593 --> 00:47:34.880
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I shall have to strengthen the casing.


779
00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.126
I'll begin work at once.

780
00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:37.842
- Well, how long will it take?
- Well, a few days.


781
00:47:37.968 --> 00:47:41.791
When the tide's out, we'll collect
the fragments and see what happened.


782
00:47:42.677 --> 00:47:44.134
I said all along it wouldn't work.

783
00:47:44.843 --> 00:47:46.709
I'm afraid you must think me
rather a fraud.


784
00:47:46.843 --> 00:47:47.959
Not at all, sir.

785
00:47:48.093 --> 00:47:50.255
But you know, things nearly always
happen like that first


786
00:47:50.385 --> 00:47:53.048
- when you're trying something new.
- Yes, I'm sure they do.


787
00:47:53.177 --> 00:47:55.385
How are you getting on
with the low-flying?


788
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:58.253
It's awfully hard to get accuracy,
I mean, to within a few feet -


789
00:47:58.385 --> 00:48:00.342
especially at night over water.

790
00:48:00.468 --> 00:48:03.302
- Still we'll find some way of doing it.
- Yes, yes, it must be very difficult.


791
00:48:03.427 --> 00:48:05.214
Bomb aiming is another headache, sir.

792
00:48:05.343 --> 00:48:07.881
The ordinary bombsight isn't
accurate enough at such a low level.


793
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.333
And you want the aircraft to drop that bomb
dead at the same spot, one after the other.


794
00:48:11.468 --> 00:48:13.300
Yes, yes, within a few feet.

795
00:48:13.427 --> 00:48:15.840
We'll look after our own headaches
and leave you to look after yours.


796
00:48:15.968 --> 00:48:18.711
I'm afraid that's all we can do at present.
Oh, I should get it right within a few days.


797
00:48:18.843 --> 00:48:21.551
- You must try and come down again.
- I'd like to, sir.


798
00:48:22.677 --> 00:48:24.669
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.


799
00:48:24.802 --> 00:48:28.170
- And to those boys of yours.
- Thanks.


800
00:48:41.177 --> 00:48:44.170
Tide's going out, I must wade in
and collect some of the pieces.


801
00:48:44.302 --> 00:48:47.215
- Can we help?
- Oh, no, no. I'm used to it.


802
00:48:47.343 --> 00:48:49.710
I just feel about in
the mud with my toes.

803
00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:52.631
Sometimes I get a bit of bomb,
sometimes it's cockles.


804
00:49:26.927 --> 00:49:29.840
How are we going to fly at a level
of 150 feet in the dark?


805
00:49:29.968 --> 00:49:31.004
That's what I want to know.

806
00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:34.583
Maybe if we left a navigator down
and we had a 150 foot wire:


807
00:49:34.718 --> 00:49:37.461
when he calls out,
we'll know we're too low!


808
00:49:37.593 --> 00:49:40.461
No bombsight that works at low level,
a bomb that falls to bits,


809
00:49:40.593 --> 00:49:42.550
no way of flying at 150 feet,

810
00:49:42.677 --> 00:49:44.714
and the raid, at all costs,
in five weeks.


811
00:49:44.843 --> 00:49:46.379
Otherwise, everything's marvellous.

812
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.173
We've got to go through London
so let's have a darn good dinner,


813
00:49:49.302 --> 00:49:51.794
a bottle of wine, a musical
with lots of dazzling girls and...


814
00:49:51.927 --> 00:49:53.043
And the night train back.

815
00:50:43.552 --> 00:50:46.420
She's nice, isn't she?

816
00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.752
- Don't you think she's nice?
- What?


817
00:51:21.885 --> 00:51:24.957
- A nice kid.
- Yes, quite.


818
00:51:51.135 --> 00:51:53.343
Up a bit...
A bit more.


819
00:51:53.468 --> 00:51:55.084
Now hold it.
Much too much.


820
00:51:58.260 --> 00:51:59.922
Down... down...

821
00:52:00.635 --> 00:52:03.343
Now, hold it now.
Fine.


822
00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.422
Sir, have a drink to celebrate.

823
00:52:20.552 --> 00:52:22.009
- We've done the trick.
- What trick?


824
00:52:22.135 --> 00:52:25.333
Flying at 150 feet. No need for altimeters,
no need for anything else.


825
00:52:25.468 --> 00:52:27.460
- How's that?
- A couple of spot lamps.


826
00:52:27.593 --> 00:52:28.959
One in the nose,
the other in the belly,


827
00:52:29.093 --> 00:52:32.052
trained to shine down and meet together
at 150 feet below the aircraft.


828
00:52:32.177 --> 00:52:34.294
All you've got to do
is to watch through the cockpit blister


829
00:52:34.427 --> 00:52:36.840
and keep the two spots plumb together
on the ground or the water,


830
00:52:36.968 --> 00:52:39.676
and there you are at 150 feet,
accurate to an inch.


831
00:52:39.802 --> 00:52:42.169
Yeah, but that would mean
carrying lights right into the attack.


832
00:52:42.302 --> 00:52:44.214
That's better than finishing up
on the drink.


833
00:52:44.343 --> 00:52:46.005
That's wonderful!
How did you think of it?


834
00:52:46.135 --> 00:52:49.048
Genius, pure genius! We gave the idea
to Farnborough and they did the rest.


835
00:52:49.177 --> 00:52:51.134
We still need a bombsight
that'll work at low level.


836
00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.751
When are we gonna get
some real bombs?


837
00:52:52.885 --> 00:52:55.468
It's getting on these fellows' nerves
not knowing a damn thing about anything.


838
00:52:55.593 --> 00:52:58.882
I know... But the old boy's got new trials
on Friday, you ought to go down again.


839
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:00.672
He's pretty sure it'll work this time.

840
00:53:19.552 --> 00:53:20.588
Oh, my God!

841
00:53:53.218 --> 00:53:56.757
- It's a bad business, isn't it?
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.


842
00:53:56.885 --> 00:53:59.878
- What are you going to do?
- I know the trouble, I must work in it again.


843
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:02.377
Well, here we are,
the 22nd of April...


844
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.469
The deadline date for the raid
is the 19th of May.


845
00:54:05.593 --> 00:54:08.586
- That's barely four weeks.
- Give me a few more days, a week at most.


846
00:54:08.718 --> 00:54:11.552
If we're going to change the design,
the factories will never do it in time.


847
00:54:11.677 --> 00:54:14.169
I shan't change the design,
I must just strengthen the casing


848
00:54:14.302 --> 00:54:15.884
and try a new method of release.

849
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.252
Well, a week from today.

850
00:54:18.385 --> 00:54:20.877
If it doesn't work then,
we shall have to call it off.


851
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:23.127
There's nothing else we can do.

852
00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:28.000
Hello, there.

853
00:54:29.177 --> 00:54:31.419
Hello, Gibson.
I was wondering if you were here.


854
00:54:31.552 --> 00:54:32.884
I was watching from down there.

855
00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:34.967
Why didn't you come
and watch it with me here?


856
00:54:35.093 --> 00:54:37.801
I knew how you must be feeling,
I guessed you'd rather be alone.


857
00:54:41.635 --> 00:54:43.342
It's a devil, isn't it?

858
00:54:44.302 --> 00:54:46.544
Yes, it is rather.

859
00:54:46.677 --> 00:54:50.045
It's most disappointing. I shall have to go
all out on some modifications.


860
00:54:50.177 --> 00:54:52.169
Er, I wonder if I could ask you
to do something.


861
00:54:52.302 --> 00:54:53.634
Of course, anything I can.

862
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.754
Well, you see, it isn't only the structure
of the bomb that's the trouble,


863
00:54:57.885 --> 00:55:02.209
it's in the dropping of it -
we muss lessen the force of the impact.


864
00:55:02.343 --> 00:55:07.213
I asked you originally if you could fly in
over water and drop the bomb at 150 feet.


865
00:55:08.552 --> 00:55:11.044
I wonder if you could
do it at 60 feet?

866
00:55:11.177 --> 00:55:13.885
- That's very low...
- Oh, yes, yes. I do realise that.


867
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.967
You'd only have to hiccup
to finish in the drink.


868
00:55:16.093 --> 00:55:19.882
Yes, I've got no right to ask you
to do a thing like that, but...


869
00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:22.593
I'm afraid it will be our only way.

870
00:55:23.385 --> 00:55:24.751
We've had a bit of luck anyway.

871
00:55:24.885 --> 00:55:27.502
We've found a way of fixing our height
with spot lamps.


872
00:55:27.635 --> 00:55:29.877
I'll have them altered for 60 feet
and have a crack at it tomorrow.


873
00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:34.801
You will?
That's... that's splendid.


874
00:55:34.927 --> 00:55:37.510
If it's too dangerous,
you mustn't hesitate to let me know.


875
00:55:37.635 --> 00:55:39.672
Oh, we'll do it all right.

876
00:55:51.468 --> 00:55:54.211
Down... down...

877
00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.796
Down...

878
00:55:57.427 --> 00:55:58.963
Steady...

879
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.797
Up a bit.

880
00:56:01.927 --> 00:56:03.543
Up a bit more.

881
00:56:04.385 --> 00:56:05.421
Steady.

882
00:56:06.593 --> 00:56:09.506
Steady... steady...

883
00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.754
Hold it now.
Hold it, hold it.


884
00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:31.340
This is bloody dangerous!

885
00:56:43.218 --> 00:56:47.963
"Sir, as a poultry farmer
doing his best in the food crisis


886
00:56:48.093 --> 00:56:50.836
"I wish to protest
against the stupid young men


887
00:56:50.968 --> 00:56:55.713
"who indulge in idiotic joy riding
at all hours of the night.


888
00:56:55.843 --> 00:56:57.709
"It may be good fun for them..."

889
00:57:01.968 --> 00:57:04.881
"...it may be good fun for them,

890
00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:08.799
"but I would point out that every time
they come over our poultry houses,


891
00:57:08.927 --> 00:57:11.419
"my hens lay premature eggs

892
00:57:11.552 --> 00:57:14.590
"that drop off the perches
and mess up the floor.


893
00:57:15.718 --> 00:57:20.918
"This means a serious loss
to both me and the country."


894
00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.501
Sir!

895
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:46.126
You've picked up something here.

896
00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:48.217
You were right about that tree,
we did take the top off.


897
00:57:48.343 --> 00:57:51.461
I know where it came from.
I suppose we'd better send it back.


898
00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:57.593
Well, it's now or never, Mutt.

899
00:57:57.718 --> 00:58:00.381
Don't you worry,
it's going to be all right.


900
00:58:01.552 --> 00:58:05.125
You'd better get a move on.
It's a good half hour's drive to Reculver.


901
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:09.343
Take a longer run in
to be certain of that altitude.


902
00:58:09.468 --> 00:58:11.300
I'll watch it.

903
00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:17.833
- Well, good luck.
- You pray for me, I'll pray for you.


904
00:58:21.718 --> 00:58:23.459
If he doesn't hurry up,
it'll be dark.


905
00:58:23.593 --> 00:58:25.710
The poor chap is probably hoping
it will be dark.


906
00:58:25.843 --> 00:58:28.802
The time I've wasted on this damn thing
is driving me crazy.


907
00:58:28.927 --> 00:58:31.920
Well, it'll all be over soon
one way or another.


908
00:58:33.177 --> 00:58:36.670
Sorry to keep you all waiting. There are
so many last minute things to attend to.


909
00:58:40.718 --> 00:58:43.301
Go ahead.
You'd better get a move on.


910
00:58:56.468 --> 00:58:57.549
Hello, Gibson.

911
00:58:58.385 --> 00:59:02.129
Ah! We've had an awful day
I never thought we'd do it.


912
00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.879
These observer fellows... I felt like a man
being driven out for execution.


913
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.252
Don't say another word
till you've looked over there and wished.


914
00:59:08.385 --> 00:59:09.466
- What?
- New moon.


915
00:59:09.593 --> 00:59:10.879
Oh!

916
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:13.218
- Have you wished?
- Oh, yes!


917
00:59:13.343 --> 00:59:15.175
- And you?
- Yep.


918
00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:17.214
That's our moon.
It's going to be a lucky one.


919
00:59:17.343 --> 00:59:20.836
I hope so.
Oh, I do hope so.


920
00:59:20.968 --> 00:59:23.756
Well, we're all right on altitude
if we can fly at 60 feet in the dark.


921
00:59:23.885 --> 00:59:26.719
My dear boy, can you do that?
That's absolutely splendid!


922
00:59:26.843 --> 00:59:28.709
Yes, we've been at it all week.

923
00:59:30.427 --> 00:59:32.134
- Here they come.
- Good luck.


924
01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:09.501
Oh, my dear God!

925
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:19.378
- Well, I must say, that was wonderful.
- I'm immensely relieved.


926
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:21.376
- Do you smoke, Wallis?
- No, thanks.


927
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.173
I'll get through to the factories tonight
and give them the green light.


928
01:00:24.302 --> 01:00:26.134
Will there be
any final instructions for them?


929
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:30.300
No, just tell them to go ahead on the same
specifications they were given last week.


930
01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:33.750
Well, Mr Wallis, it must be a wonderful
feeling to achieve a thing like this -


931
01:00:33.885 --> 01:00:35.968
to conceive something
absolutely unheard of


932
01:00:36.093 --> 01:00:38.426
and carry it through
with flying colours.


933
01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.794
How on earth did
you ever get the idea?

934
01:00:41.635 --> 01:00:46.300
Well... to be quite honest,
it isn't really my idea at all. I...


935
01:00:46.427 --> 01:00:48.009
I got it from Nelson.

936
01:00:48.135 --> 01:00:49.592
Nelson, you say?

937
01:00:49.718 --> 01:00:51.801
Yes, he discovered
that under certain conditions


938
01:00:51.927 --> 01:00:54.385
he could get more destructive results
from his cannon balls


939
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:58.003
by making them ricochet off the sea
before hitting the enemy ships.


940
01:00:58.135 --> 01:01:02.584
Usually he pitched them about two thirds
of the way between his guns and the target.


941
01:01:02.718 --> 01:01:06.962
But there is some evidence to suggest
that during the Battle of the Nile


942
01:01:07.093 --> 01:01:10.541
he dismissed the French flagship
with a yorker.


943
01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:15.967
Wing Commander Gibson, sir.

944
01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:20.047
- Good evening, Gibson.
- Good evening, sir.


945
01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:23.045
I've been looking at the reconnaissance
photographs that came in today.


946
01:01:23.177 --> 01:01:26.011
It looks as if the water will be
at the level we need in a week's time.


947
01:01:26.135 --> 01:01:29.799
The moon's full next Tuesday.
So, you see, we're pretty close to deadline.


948
01:01:29.927 --> 01:01:33.045
We're all right on low flying, but there's
still the matter of the special bombsight.


949
01:01:33.177 --> 01:01:35.464
Yes, I know, I've had
the backroom boys busy on that.


950
01:01:35.593 --> 01:01:39.587
You're going to laugh when you see this.
It looks like a coat hanger from a bazaar.


951
01:01:39.718 --> 01:01:44.167
Do you see the idea? Your bomb aimer
keeps his eye to this little peephole.


952
01:01:44.302 --> 01:01:46.510
When these two nails
at the end of the arms


953
01:01:46.635 --> 01:01:48.752
are in direct alignment with the towers,

954
01:01:48.885 --> 01:01:51.002
then you'll be exactly

955
01:01:51.135 --> 01:01:53.092
and away goes your bomb.

956
01:01:53.218 --> 01:01:54.800
Do you think it's too simple?

957
01:01:54.927 --> 01:01:57.635
No, sir. I'm all in favour
of things being simple, but...


958
01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.501
- Good Lord...
- There it is.


959
01:01:59.635 --> 01:02:02.173
Try it out on the towers
at the Derwent Water dam.


960
01:02:32.302 --> 01:02:33.338
Bomb gone.

961
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:56.091
Bomb gone.

962
01:03:17.302 --> 01:03:18.418
Bomb gone!

963
01:03:40.427 --> 01:03:44.216
Well, the sixpenny bombsight works,
and the spot lamps work.


964
01:03:44.343 --> 01:03:47.666
We've flown 2,000 hours and dropped
more than 2,000 practice bombs.


965
01:03:48.343 --> 01:03:50.960
The specially converted aircraft
start arriving tomorrow.


966
01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.675
So from now until the word go,

967
01:03:52.802 --> 01:03:55.545
I want you to practise flying them
at you're proper all-up weights.


968
01:03:55.677 --> 01:03:57.134
You can work that out, Dinghy.

969
01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.297
Don't forget that
some of the armour's been taken out.


970
01:03:59.427 --> 01:04:01.965
And don't exceed 63,000lbs,
otherwise we shan't get off.


971
01:04:02.885 --> 01:04:03.921
Any problems?

972
01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:06.260
Do you want the front gunner to stay
in his turret the whole time?


973
01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:07.876
Yes, he'll have to deal
with the flak guns.


974
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.842
The trouble about that is his feet.

975
01:04:09.968 --> 01:04:12.335
They dangle
in front of the bomb-aimer's face.


976
01:04:12.468 --> 01:04:14.380
How about fixing up stirrups
to get his feet out of the way


977
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:15.876
and make him more comfortable?

978
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:18.297
- That's a good plan.
- Have you any idea when we're going, sir?


979
01:04:20.677 --> 01:04:24.125
Probably within a week,
but keep it under your hats.


980
01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.219
You won't have to put up with being called
the armchair squadron much longer.


981
01:04:27.343 --> 01:04:29.801
Two months without an operation -
it's getting a stale joke now.


982
01:04:29.927 --> 01:04:33.420
There was damn nearly a riot when a fellow
from 57th Squadron started it again.


983
01:04:33.552 --> 01:04:35.635
Our fellows would feel better
if they blew off steam.


984
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.208
All right, the next time anyone
start's being funny, have a riot.


985
01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:42.293
All right, that's all.

986
01:04:47.385 --> 01:04:49.377
- Have you seen the squadron orders?
- Yes.


987
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:51.797
- Any news?
- No, same old stuff.


988
01:04:54.343 --> 01:04:56.255
It's good to have
an evening off for once.


989
01:04:56.385 --> 01:05:00.925
Yes, sixteen ops last month,
seven in the first two weeks in May.


990
01:05:01.052 --> 01:05:04.045
What are you fellows going to do
when you've worn those armchairs out?


991
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:12.842
It's a joke, you know?
Can't you take it?


992
01:05:12.968 --> 01:05:16.257
We're getting a little tired of it.
Come on, chaps.


993
01:05:34.635 --> 01:05:36.251
Come in.

994
01:05:37.177 --> 01:05:40.921
The Group Captain's asking for you, sir.
He's waiting outside.


995
01:05:53.052 --> 01:05:55.339
- Steady!
- Let go!


996
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:16.002
Thank you, sir.
Saved my life.


997
01:06:20.135 --> 01:06:22.001
- Hello, Guy.
- What's going on?


998
01:06:22.135 --> 01:06:25.503
One of the boys from 57th Squadron
shot his mouth off once too often,


999
01:06:25.635 --> 01:06:27.547
- set things going.
- Oh.


1000
01:06:28.635 --> 01:06:32.299
I've just had word from Group.
Weather reports are good.


1001
01:06:32.427 --> 01:06:35.625
If it holds like this,
you'll do the job tomorrow night.


1002
01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:39.427
Good. What about the bombs?

1003
01:06:39.552 --> 01:06:41.214
They're arriving now.

1004
01:06:43.677 --> 01:06:45.919
Uh... I'm glad we're going.

1005
01:06:46.052 --> 01:06:49.796
There's no harm telling your flight
commanders, but keep it to yourselves.


1006
01:06:49.927 --> 01:06:51.463
Right.

1007
01:06:52.677 --> 01:06:55.294
Well, I'll break up that show in there
and get the boys to bed.


1008
01:06:55.427 --> 01:06:57.043
Fine.

1009
01:06:59.427 --> 01:07:02.170
- I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.


1010
01:08:11.177 --> 01:08:13.043
- Would you sit there, sir, please?
- Yes.


1011
01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:20.592
Be seated gentlemen, please.

1012
01:08:25.843 --> 01:08:27.050
For the past six weeks,

1013
01:08:27.177 --> 01:08:30.136
you've been wondering
why this squadron has been formed...


1014
01:08:35.885 --> 01:08:37.717
Commander Gibson, carry on.

1015
01:08:41.968 --> 01:08:43.800
Well, the training's over.

1016
01:08:45.052 --> 01:08:46.418
For obvious reasons,

1017
01:08:46.552 --> 01:08:49.875
you've had to work without knowing
your target or even your weapon.


1018
01:08:50.718 --> 01:08:52.675
You've had to put up with a good deal
from other people


1019
01:08:52.802 --> 01:08:55.715
who think you've been having a soft time.

1020
01:08:55.843 --> 01:08:58.802
But tonight,
you're going to have the chance


1021
01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:02.841
to hit the enemy harder
and more destructively


1022
01:09:02.968 --> 01:09:05.301
than any small force
has ever done before.


1023
01:09:08.302 --> 01:09:12.000
You're going to attack
the great dams of Western Germany.


1024
01:09:16.468 --> 01:09:17.504
Here are your targets.

1025
01:09:20.135 --> 01:09:22.343
Here's the Möhne dam.

1026
01:09:22.468 --> 01:09:24.425
That's the Eder.

1027
01:09:24.552 --> 01:09:25.633
And there's the Sorpe.

1028
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.922
All just east of the Ruhr.

1029
01:09:28.885 --> 01:09:31.093
Now, we shall attack in three formations.

1030
01:09:31.218 --> 01:09:33.676
The first will take the Möhne dam
as its first target,


1031
01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:35.589
then carry on to the Eder.

1032
01:09:35.718 --> 01:09:38.461
That will be nine aircraft
in three waves,


1033
01:09:38.593 --> 01:09:41.051
taking off ten minutes
between each wave.


1034
01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:44.625
I'll lead the first
with Hopgood and Martin.


1035
01:09:45.302 --> 01:09:48.670
Young leads the second
with Maltby and Shannon.


1036
01:09:50.218 --> 01:09:53.382
And Maudslay the third,
with Knight and Astell.


1037
01:09:54.052 --> 01:09:56.886
The second formation
will consist of five aircraft.


1038
01:09:57.010 --> 01:10:02.927
Joe McCarthy, Byers, Barlow,
Rice and Munro.


1039
01:10:03.052 --> 01:10:06.796
They'll go by this northern route
to attack the Sorpe,


1040
01:10:06.927 --> 01:10:11.001
and also act as a diversion
to split up enemy fighters.


1041
01:10:11.135 --> 01:10:15.209
The third formation will follow
as a mobile reserve to fill in gaps.


1042
01:10:15.927 --> 01:10:17.759
That will be five aircraft.

1043
01:10:17.885 --> 01:10:22.630
Townsend, Anderson, Brown,
Ottley and Burpee.


1044
01:10:29.135 --> 01:10:33.175
Now, there's a full moon tonight,
so normal ops are out.


1045
01:10:33.302 --> 01:10:35.510
We'll be the only people flying.

1046
01:10:35.635 --> 01:10:41.461
And to avoid the fighters, we'll have to keep
at zero feet all the way there and back.


1047
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.627
Any questions?

1048
01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.377
- Can I say something about the route, sir?
- Yes, go ahead.


1049
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:22.083
I see you've taken it very near
a synthetic rubber factory at Hüls.


1050
01:11:22.218 --> 01:11:24.130
There's a great deal of flak around there.

1051
01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.502
It's a hot spot. We nearly got
the chop there about three months ago.


1052
01:11:27.218 --> 01:11:29.631
Can I suggest
we go a little further north?


1053
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.173
Yes, we knew about the Hüls flak
when we planned the route.


1054
01:11:32.302 --> 01:11:33.759
The trouble is,

1055
01:11:33.885 --> 01:11:38.334
if we go much further north,
we run into another hot spot round here.


1056
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:42.547
Anyway, we can take it up a little.

1057
01:11:42.677 --> 01:11:47.468
Now, the gap isn't too wide,
so watch it, you navigators.


1058
01:11:47.593 --> 01:11:49.459
What about the defences on the dam, sir?

1059
01:11:49.593 --> 01:11:52.461
Reconnaissance show's them
as being fairly light,


1060
01:11:52.593 --> 01:11:55.085
but you'll see the photos in a minute.

1061
01:11:55.218 --> 01:11:57.710
Any balloons, sir?

1062
01:11:58.468 --> 01:12:02.007
Up till yesterday, the nearest ones were
around a small factory 12 miles away.


1063
01:12:02.135 --> 01:12:03.216
We don't expect any.

1064
01:12:05.302 --> 01:12:09.296
Sorry, old boy. It's secret, you can't go in.
Now, come on, hop it.


1065
01:12:12.843 --> 01:12:14.960
Hello, Nigger, old boy.
What are you doing?


1066
01:12:15.802 --> 01:12:19.341
Who are you looking for, eh?
He's not in his office.


1067
01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:22.381
You'd better try somewhere else.
Go on, away you go. Go on!


1068
01:12:28.927 --> 01:12:32.796
Hello, Nigger.
No, not in here, old boy. Go on.


1069
01:12:38.843 --> 01:12:41.711
Hello, Nigger, old boy.
What are you doing around here?


1070
01:12:43.218 --> 01:12:45.676
Nigger!

1071
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:53.003
Well, there it is.
That's what the bomb does.


1072
01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:54.751
The rest is for you.

1073
01:12:56.177 --> 01:12:59.591
And may I say...
good luck to you all.


1074
01:13:06.385 --> 01:13:09.378
You see, the Möhne lake looks rather like
a big double tooth.


1075
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:14.084
These strips of water are the roots
with the dam here in the crown.


1076
01:13:14.218 --> 01:13:16.631
Here's the Körbecke bridge
where we assemble.


1077
01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.629
And here's the spit of land which gives us
a head-on approach for the attack.


1078
01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.296
Now study these models.

1079
01:13:22.427 --> 01:13:25.465
Get every detail of them in your heads
until you know them with your eyes shut.


1080
01:13:26.052 --> 01:13:28.135
Now get these code words off by heart.

1081
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.049
"Goner" is the word for the explosion
of a bomb in the right place.


1082
01:13:32.177 --> 01:13:35.500
"Nigger" is the code word
for a breach in the Möhne dam,


1083
01:13:35.635 --> 01:13:37.843
and "Dinghy" for a breach in the Eder.

1084
01:13:55.052 --> 01:13:58.124
- Do you want me, Crosby?
- Er, I'm sorry, sir, it's Nigger.


1085
01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.799
He's been run over. He's dead.
The car didn't even stop.


1086
01:14:01.927 --> 01:14:04.010
- Where did it happen?
- Outside the main gate.


1087
01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:06.752
He run across the road, sir,
and the car hit him.


1088
01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:09.468
- Where is he?
- In the guard room, sir.


1089
01:14:11.635 --> 01:14:13.547
I see.

1090
01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:30.296
Bacon and eggs for me, please.

1091
01:14:30.427 --> 01:14:32.293
- Are you flying tonight, sir?
- Am I flying?


1092
01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:35.420
You know perfectly well I'm the fellow
who pays you every Friday fortnight.


1093
01:14:35.552 --> 01:14:38.215
Your bread and jam
is on the centre table, sir.


1094
01:14:39.302 --> 01:14:41.214
No harm in trying.

1095
01:14:44.343 --> 01:14:46.881
- We've got the wrong oil.
- It was all checked out this morning.


1096
01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:49.468
No, I don't mean that oil.
It's the bomb release gear.


1097
01:14:49.593 --> 01:14:51.550
Wallis is chasing around
for the right kind.


1098
01:14:51.677 --> 01:14:53.543
- Can he get it?
- I hope so.


1099
01:14:53.677 --> 01:14:57.546
- Are you flying tonight, sir?
- That's the general idea.


1100
01:15:00.343 --> 01:15:02.255
Can I have you next egg
if you don't come back?


1101
01:15:02.385 --> 01:15:03.796
OK, I'll have yours if you don't.

1102
01:15:24.218 --> 01:15:25.584
We've still got an hour.

1103
01:15:25.718 --> 01:15:28.335
Let's go and put our feet up for a bit
before we change, huh?


1104
01:15:28.468 --> 01:15:30.926
Not a bad idea. Come on.

1105
01:15:32.843 --> 01:15:34.835
Got anything for me?

1106
01:15:34.968 --> 01:15:36.709
Just one, sir.

1107
01:15:39.052 --> 01:15:42.011
- It's only a missed bill!
- Eleven pound three and six.


1108
01:15:42.135 --> 01:15:44.377
I think I'll pay that tomorrow.

1109
01:15:45.885 --> 01:15:47.547
Thank you.

1110
01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:51.718
It's all right,
they had some of the lighter oil in store.


1111
01:15:51.843 --> 01:15:53.584
- Oh, good.
- They're changing it now.


1112
01:15:53.718 --> 01:15:54.834
Bit of luck you noticed it, sir.

1113
01:15:54.968 --> 01:15:57.631
I'm afraid it was my fault.
I didn't make it quite clear.


1114
01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.547
What about some supper?

1115
01:15:59.677 --> 01:16:02.260
Well... I think I'll have some later.

1116
01:16:03.718 --> 01:16:05.300
Does it worry you, having me about?

1117
01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.293
Good heavens, no.
I'm jolly glad you came!


1118
01:16:07.427 --> 01:16:08.918
Was my talk at the briefing all right?

1119
01:16:09.052 --> 01:16:11.135
Oh, fine.
You sold them that bomb hands down.


1120
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.593
Coffee, sir?

1121
01:16:13.718 --> 01:16:15.630
Er, no, thank you.

1122
01:16:17.468 --> 01:16:20.711
Go on, have some.
There's plenty of time.


1123
01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:22.630
Oh, thank you.

1124
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:44.797
Evening, sir.

1125
01:16:45.927 --> 01:16:47.793
- Flight...
- Sir?


1126
01:16:47.927 --> 01:16:49.634
Just a minute.

1127
01:16:50.677 --> 01:16:52.384
You know that Nigger was killed
this afternoon?


1128
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:54.923
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry, sir.

1129
01:16:55.052 --> 01:16:56.714
Would you do something for me?

1130
01:16:56.843 --> 01:17:00.507
I'd like you to you bury him at midnight
on the grass verge outside my office.


1131
01:17:00.635 --> 01:17:02.501
Very good, sir.

1132
01:17:02.635 --> 01:17:06.675
I'd like you to do it then just about the
time we're going into the job over there.


1133
01:17:06.802 --> 01:17:08.759
I'll see it's done, sir.

1134
01:17:11.635 --> 01:17:15.379
Hello, Hoppy. Tonight's the night,
tomorrow we'll have a party.


1135
01:17:31.593 --> 01:17:33.835
Come in.

1136
01:17:35.052 --> 01:17:38.011
- Laundry just in, sir.
- Oh, great.


1137
01:17:51.052 --> 01:17:53.135
Well...

1138
01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:56.458
I think I'll have a clean shirt
and a nice clean shave.


1139
01:17:56.593 --> 01:17:57.879
What do you want to shave for now?

1140
01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:01.549
Well, if we have to bail out,
you never know who we might meet.


1141
01:18:04.052 --> 01:18:06.009
There's no point in me bothering.

1142
01:18:06.135 --> 01:18:08.798
If we come down together
and there happens to be two about,


1143
01:18:08.927 --> 01:18:11.135
I'm bound to get the ugly one!

1144
01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.050
- All right, sir?
- Yes.


1145
01:20:54.718 --> 01:20:57.631
Well, chaps, my watch says time to go.

1146
01:22:25.427 --> 01:22:27.043
- How is she, Sergeant?
- Bang on, sir.


1147
01:22:27.177 --> 01:22:28.384
Good.

1148
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:25.717
- All set?
- Yes, sir.


1149
01:23:25.843 --> 01:23:28.130
Well, you've done a fine job
with this team.


1150
01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.172
I couldn't have asked for a better one.

1151
01:23:30.302 --> 01:23:32.669
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.


1152
01:23:32.802 --> 01:23:34.543
Good luck.

1153
01:23:36.885 --> 01:23:38.547
Come on, then.

1154
01:23:53.427 --> 01:23:54.463
OK, Hutch.

1155
01:24:05.843 --> 01:24:07.584
Contact port outer.

1156
01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:09.879
Contact port outer.

1157
01:26:09.052 --> 01:26:11.214
Pitch fully fine.

1158
01:26:11.343 --> 01:26:14.177
- Pitch fully fine.
- Check fuel.


1159
01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:18.799
- Fuel OK.
- Lamps 25 degrees.


1160
01:26:18.927 --> 01:26:21.840
- Lamps 25 degrees.
- Radiator shutters automatic.


1161
01:26:22.802 --> 01:26:24.839
Radiator shutters automatic.

1162
01:28:19.677 --> 01:28:23.045
Well, I suppose
there's nothing much we can do.


1163
01:28:24.093 --> 01:28:26.631
Except wait.

1164
01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.958
The AOC is waiting
to take us back to Grantham.


1165
01:28:47.843 --> 01:28:50.756
Send a message to Hopgood.

1166
01:28:57.927 --> 01:29:00.465
Hey, Sparks?
P-Popsy signalling.


1167
01:29:13.968 --> 01:29:16.210
Martin is having a chat with Hopgood.

1168
01:29:27.802 --> 01:29:29.043
What's he saying, Hutch?

1169
01:29:32.052 --> 01:29:34.214
He says we're going to get
speeches tomorrow night.


1170
01:29:35.343 --> 01:29:38.836
Sure we are!
Biggest binge of all time.


1171
01:30:01.677 --> 01:30:03.213
Carry on.

1172
01:30:03.343 --> 01:30:06.541
- Well, Coggie, how is it going?
- All right so far, sir.


1173
01:30:06.677 --> 01:30:09.090
The first wave is about 20 miles
from the Dutch coast.


1174
01:30:09.218 --> 01:30:12.177
Enemy radar has probably
picked them up by now.


1175
01:30:12.302 --> 01:30:16.251
Cheer up, Wallis.
This is your night as well as theirs.


1176
01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:41.877
Skipper, ground speed: 203.

1177
01:30:42.010 --> 01:30:43.592
We'll be there in one hour,
ten minutes.


1178
01:30:43.718 --> 01:30:46.176
We'll be over the Dutch coast
in two minutes.


1179
01:30:51.468 --> 01:30:54.666
There it is now.
Stand by, front gunner, we're going over.


1180
01:31:27.843 --> 01:31:30.915
The second wave should be coming up
to the Dutch coast now.


1181
01:31:52.052 --> 01:31:54.089
Enemy coast ahead.

1182
01:32:47.968 --> 01:32:50.210
Enemy coast ahead.

1183
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:21.002
We should be on
the line of the canal.

1184
01:34:25.718 --> 01:34:27.004
OK, I've got it.

1185
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:46.048
Watch out for pylons.

1186
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:52.923
- There they are.
- Pylons?


1187
01:35:06.052 --> 01:35:10.046
At the junction, we alter course.
The next thing we see is the Rhein.


1188
01:36:28.718 --> 01:36:31.005
This is new.
Hutch, warn the others.


1189
01:37:12.677 --> 01:37:16.045
New course, Skipper:

1190
01:37:38.677 --> 01:37:41.636
The northern wave's
run into trouble on the coast.


1191
01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.673
McCarthy is going on
to the Sorpe dam by himself.


1192
01:37:46.052 --> 01:37:49.375
Gibson's formation should be nearly
at the Möhne by now.


1193
01:37:59.718 --> 01:38:01.505
There's the lake now.

1194
01:38:01.635 --> 01:38:04.093
The main lake and the dam
are off to the right.


1195
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:34.967
There it is, boys.

1196
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:38.173
Bit aggressive, aren't they?
Someone's woken them up.


1197
01:38:38.302 --> 01:38:39.918
What do you think about it, Bob?

1198
01:38:40.052 --> 01:38:43.545
My goodness! It's big, isn't it?
Can we really break that?


1199
01:38:43.677 --> 01:38:45.293
How many guns
do you think there are, Trevor?


1200
01:38:45.427 --> 01:38:47.384
I say there's about ten guns.

1201
01:38:48.552 --> 01:38:51.750
Some in the fields
and some in the towers.


1202
01:38:51.885 --> 01:38:54.628
We've seem to upset them a bit.

1203
01:39:07.802 --> 01:39:09.213
P for Popsy, are you there?

1204
01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:11.046
OK, leader.

1205
01:39:11.177 --> 01:39:14.750
- Hello, M-Mother. Are you there?
- I'm here, leader.


1206
01:39:14.885 --> 01:39:17.127
- Here, leader.
- Here, leader.


1207
01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:19.468
- Here, leader.
- Here, leader.


1208
01:39:19.593 --> 01:39:20.879
Here, leader.

1209
01:39:23.968 --> 01:39:29.088
Hello, all cooler aircraft.
I'm going into attack.


1210
01:39:29.218 --> 01:39:31.551
Stand by to come in
in your order when I tell you.


1211
01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:45.708
Hello, M for Mother.
Stand by to take over if anything happens.


1212
01:39:45.843 --> 01:39:48.051
OK, leader. Good luck.

1213
01:40:06.343 --> 01:40:08.881
Check height, Teddy.
Speed control, Pulford.


1214
01:40:09.010 --> 01:40:10.171
Gunners ready.

1215
01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.217
Coming up, Spam.

1216
01:40:12.885 --> 01:40:16.708
- 220.
- This is fine, I can see everything.


1217
01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.592
- Down a little.
- 230.


1218
01:40:22.218 --> 01:40:24.551
- 230.
- Steady.


1219
01:40:24.677 --> 01:40:26.168
- Down a little.
- 235.


1220
01:40:26.302 --> 01:40:28.419
Stand by
to pull me under the seat if I get hit.


1221
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:34.217
- Steady...
- 240.


1222
01:40:34.343 --> 01:40:35.379
Steady...

1223
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:38.503
- Hold her steady.
- 235.


1224
01:40:39.427 --> 01:40:41.419
- Hold it.
- 240.


1225
01:40:41.552 --> 01:40:43.088
Hold it.

1226
01:40:43.218 --> 01:40:44.675
- 235.
- That's fine.


1227
01:40:44.802 --> 01:40:47.010
- 235.
- Bomb, gone!


1228
01:41:08.468 --> 01:41:11.211
Good shot, sir! Nice work!

1229
01:41:11.343 --> 01:41:13.585
- Nice work, Skipper.
- Bang on, Skipper.


1230
01:41:20.218 --> 01:41:23.177
It's gone, we've done it.

1231
01:41:23.302 --> 01:41:26.750
We haven't. It's still there.

1232
01:41:30.968 --> 01:41:32.800
Hello, M for Mother.
Are you there?


1233
01:41:33.468 --> 01:41:35.004
Standing by, leader.

1234
01:41:35.135 --> 01:41:37.218
Hang on a minute,
till the water calms down.


1235
01:41:38.010 --> 01:41:41.299
Hutch, send back codeword "Goner".

1236
01:41:48.593 --> 01:41:50.585
Goner...

1237
01:41:50.718 --> 01:41:52.835
from D George.

1238
01:41:56.927 --> 01:41:58.839
That's all.

1239
01:41:59.677 --> 01:42:01.760
I'd hoped one bomb might do it.

1240
01:42:12.427 --> 01:42:16.000
Hello, M-Mother.
It's your turn, you can go in now.


1241
01:42:16.135 --> 01:42:17.797
Good luck.

1242
01:42:17.927 --> 01:42:20.544
OK, leader. Attacking!

1243
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:22.921
Stand by to go in.

1244
01:42:34.468 --> 01:42:37.051
If he doesn't drop his bomb now,
it'll be too late.


1245
01:42:37.177 --> 01:42:40.011
He's dropped it. There it goes.
Oh, they've got him!


1246
01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:42.421
It's gone right over the top.

1247
01:43:06.010 --> 01:43:07.251
Hello, P for Popsy.

1248
01:43:07.927 --> 01:43:09.634
- Are you there?
- OK, leader.


1249
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.046
You can go right in.

1250
01:43:11.177 --> 01:43:14.670
I'll fly across the dam as you make your run
and try and draw the flak off you.


1251
01:43:14.802 --> 01:43:16.634
OK, thanks, leader.

1252
01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.592
Stand by, everyone.
We're going in.


1253
01:43:32.718 --> 01:43:34.129
230.

1254
01:43:35.135 --> 01:43:36.922
230.

1255
01:43:37.468 --> 01:43:39.425
- 230.
- Down a bit.


1256
01:43:39.552 --> 01:43:40.713
- 235.
- Down a bit.


1257
01:43:41.385 --> 01:43:42.717
Steady.

1258
01:43:42.843 --> 01:43:44.254
- Up a bit.
- 230.


1259
01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:45.421
It's all yours, Bob.

1260
01:43:46.135 --> 01:43:47.467
- 235.
- Steady.


1261
01:43:51.343 --> 01:43:53.505
- Hold her...
- 230.


1262
01:43:53.635 --> 01:43:55.171
Hold her, steady.

1263
01:43:55.302 --> 01:43:56.668
- 235.
- Hold her.


1264
01:43:56.802 --> 01:43:58.338
- 235.
- That's fine.


1265
01:43:58.468 --> 01:43:59.834
- 235.
- Bomb gone!


1266
01:44:09.593 --> 01:44:11.505
The starboard wing is hit!

1267
01:44:12.218 --> 01:44:14.631
Starboard out was empty, thank God.

1268
01:44:15.385 --> 01:44:17.877
- Bomb's gone, leader.
- OK, Popsy.


1269
01:44:18.010 --> 01:44:19.717
Let me know
when you're out of the flak.


1270
01:44:20.593 --> 01:44:21.925
All OK behind.

1271
01:44:35.010 --> 01:44:36.967
Goner from P
-Popsy.

1272
01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:51.546
That's all.

1273
01:45:09.135 --> 01:45:10.922
Hello, A-Apple.
Are you ready?


1274
01:45:11.552 --> 01:45:13.168
OK, leader.

1275
01:45:13.302 --> 01:45:16.966
Let me know when you're
in position, and I'll draw the flak for you.


1276
01:45:17.968 --> 01:45:19.425
P
-Popsy, are you hit?

1277
01:45:20.135 --> 01:45:23.333
Starboard wing, but we're all right,
we can make it.


1278
01:45:23.468 --> 01:45:24.879
A
-Apple is going to attack.

1279
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:27.753
Come in on his starboard side
and help me draw the flak.


1280
01:45:27.885 --> 01:45:28.966
OK, leader.

1281
01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:32.377
A
-Apple making bombing run.

1282
01:46:45.427 --> 01:46:47.259
Goner...

1283
01:46:48.010 --> 01:46:50.047
from A
-Apple.

1284
01:46:54.052 --> 01:46:56.169
That's all.

1285
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:09.217
Hello, J-Johnny.
Are you ready?


1286
01:47:09.343 --> 01:47:11.585
OK, leader.

1287
01:47:11.718 --> 01:47:14.210
All right, go ahead.
We'll come in with you.


1288
01:48:05.427 --> 01:48:08.625
- Are you there, Dave?
- Ready, leader.


1289
01:48:09.343 --> 01:48:11.585
OK. Stand by to attack.

1290
01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:21.334
It's gone! Look!

1291
01:48:21.468 --> 01:48:23.505
My God!

1292
01:48:33.135 --> 01:48:34.922
- Are you there, Dave?
- Ready, leader.


1293
01:48:36.177 --> 01:48:38.385
It's all right. Skip it!

1294
01:48:52.218 --> 01:48:55.177
All right, boys.
Nice work! You've had your look.


1295
01:48:55.302 --> 01:48:58.374
P-Popsy and J-Johnny,
set course for home.


1296
01:48:58.510 --> 01:49:00.001
The rest of you, come along with me.

1297
01:49:20.218 --> 01:49:22.005
It's Nigger! It's gone!

1298
01:49:25.635 --> 01:49:27.843
- You've done it, Wallis.
- Well done, well done!


1299
01:49:27.968 --> 01:49:29.709
Congratulations!

1300
01:49:40.677 --> 01:49:42.919
I reckon you should be able
to see it by now.


1301
01:49:49.968 --> 01:49:52.005
No sign of it.

1302
01:49:54.343 --> 01:49:55.800
Do you recognise anything, Spam?

1303
01:49:57.385 --> 01:50:00.378
Plenty of water...
No dam yet.


1304
01:50:02.385 --> 01:50:04.968
Wait... there it is!

1305
01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:14.876
All right, Dave.
You go in first.


1306
01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:16.251
There doesn't seem to be any flaks,

1307
01:50:16.385 --> 01:50:18.092
but it's not going to be easy
with all these hills.


1308
01:50:18.218 --> 01:50:21.757
- Can you see the castle?
- I've got it, leader.


1309
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:25.547
That's your way in.
Take your time.


1310
01:50:25.677 --> 01:50:28.169
We've only got three bombs.

1311
01:50:28.302 --> 01:50:30.840
OK, leader.
Going in now.


1312
01:50:52.302 --> 01:50:54.214
Down... down...

1313
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:58.879
Down... down... down...

1314
01:50:59.010 --> 01:51:00.797
- We're too high.
- Down...


1315
01:51:00.927 --> 01:51:03.260
We're too high, Skipper.
We won't make it.


1316
01:51:03.385 --> 01:51:05.547
Steady. Hold it there.

1317
01:51:05.677 --> 01:51:08.135
It's too late, Skipper.
It's too late.


1318
01:51:31.885 --> 01:51:33.751
Sorry, leader.
Made a mess of that.


1319
01:51:33.885 --> 01:51:38.425
- I'll try again.
- All right, Dave. You hang around for a bit.


1320
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:41.797
Hello, Z
-Zebra. Are you there?

1321
01:51:41.927 --> 01:51:44.169
Here, leader. I've got the target.

1322
01:51:44.302 --> 01:51:48.842
All right, you can go in now.
There's no flak, but watch those hills.


1323
01:51:48.968 --> 01:51:51.881
Take your time,
and mind the mountain on the other side.


1324
01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:55.833
- OK, leader. I'm going in.
- Good luck.


1325
01:52:28.718 --> 01:52:30.004
He's left it too late.

1326
01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:39.798
Hello, Z-Zebra.
Are you all right?


1327
01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.298
I think so, leader.
Stand by.


1328
01:53:10.385 --> 01:53:12.342
Goner Z
-Zebra.

1329
01:53:15.968 --> 01:53:18.460
That leaves two more.

1330
01:53:18.593 --> 01:53:20.380
Cocoa, sir?

1331
01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.468
- Sir?
- No.


1332
01:53:37.343 --> 01:53:39.300
Are you in touch
with the reserve formation?


1333
01:53:39.427 --> 01:53:42.841
All except Burpee, sir.
He hasn't answered for some time.


1334
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:49.718
Goner, L
-Leather.

1335
01:53:57.010 --> 01:54:00.754
OK, Dave.
Bang on, but you didn't break it.


1336
01:54:00.885 --> 01:54:03.719
Hello, N for Nuts.
Are you ready to make your attack?


1337
01:54:03.843 --> 01:54:05.800
Ready, leader.

1338
01:54:11.802 --> 01:54:15.125
Come in down mode
and dive for the point, Les.


1339
01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:17.047
Get off the air, Dave.

1340
01:54:17.177 --> 01:54:20.375
You've got the last bomb, Les,
so take your time.


1341
01:54:21.010 --> 01:54:22.171
Good luck.

1342
01:54:29.468 --> 01:54:32.632
Down... down...

1343
01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.752
Steady... hold it...

1344
01:54:35.552 --> 01:54:36.918
A little bit more...

1345
01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.877
That's fine, steady...

1346
01:54:41.010 --> 01:54:43.377
Steady... bomb gone!

1347
01:55:15.302 --> 01:55:18.921
It's Dinghy! They've done it!
They've got the Eder dam as well!


1348
01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:28.084
Wallis, when you first came to me with this,
I didn't believe a word you said.


1349
01:55:28.218 --> 01:55:31.461
But now, you can
sell me a pink elephant!

1350
01:55:41.968 --> 01:55:44.255
All right, boys, scram for home.

1351
01:55:45.177 --> 01:55:48.500
They know we're here now,
so keep your eyes open.


1352
01:59:27.885 --> 01:59:29.751
'This is London.

1353
01:59:29.885 --> 01:59:32.593
'The Air Ministry have just
issued the following communiqué.


1354
01:59:33.385 --> 01:59:37.334
'In early hours of this morning,
a force of Lancasters of Bomber Command


1355
01:59:37.468 --> 01:59:41.542
'led by Wing Commander G. P. Gibson,
DSO, DFC,


1356
01:59:41.677 --> 01:59:46.593
'attacked with mines the dams
of the Möhne and Sorpe reservoirs.


1357
01:59:46.718 --> 01:59:51.588
'These controlled two-thirds of the water
storage capacity of the Ruhr basin.


1358
01:59:52.552 --> 01:59:55.511
'Reconnaissance later established
that the Möhne dam


1359
01:59:55.635 --> 01:59:58.469
'had been breached over a length
of 100 yards


1360
01:59:58.593 --> 02:00:03.008
'and that the power station below had been
swept away by the resulting floods.


1361
02:00:03.135 --> 02:00:04.467
'The Eder dam,

1362
02:00:04.593 --> 02:00:08.041
'which controls the head-waters
of the Weser and Fulda valleys


1363
02:00:08.177 --> 02:00:10.043
'and operates several power stations,

1364
02:00:10.177 --> 02:00:13.420
'was also attacked
and was reported as breached.


1365
02:00:14.010 --> 02:00:18.175
'Photographs show the river below the dam
in full flood.


1366
02:00:18.302 --> 02:00:21.420
'The attacks were pressed home
from a very low level


1367
02:00:21.552 --> 02:00:26.422
'with great determination and coolness
in the face of fierce resistance.


1368
02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:29.875
'Eight of the Lancasters are missing.'

1369
02:01:45.135 --> 02:01:47.127
Is it true?
All those fellows lost?


1370
02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:49.673
Only two aircrafts went down
in the attacks.


1371
02:01:49.802 --> 02:01:52.135
That was Hopgood's over the Möhne
and Maudslay's over the Eder.


1372
02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:54.593
Astell got it soon after crossing the coast,

1373
02:01:54.718 --> 02:01:58.382
and Dinghy Young was shot down
over the sea on his way home.


1374
02:01:59.343 --> 02:02:01.130
The rest we don't know about.

1375
02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:03.718
They've been calling them since midnight,
but they haven't answered.


1376
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:07.344
The flak was bad,
worse than I expected.


1377
02:02:08.468 --> 02:02:10.255
56 men!

1378
02:02:11.052 --> 02:02:15.001
If I'd known it was going to be like this,
I'd never have started it.


1379
02:02:15.885 --> 02:02:17.296
You mustn't think that way.

1380
02:02:17.427 --> 02:02:19.510
If these fellows had known
they wouldn't be coming back,


1381
02:02:19.635 --> 02:02:21.001
they'd have gone just the same.

1382
02:02:21.135 --> 02:02:23.297
There isn't a single one of them
that would have dropped out.


1383
02:02:23.427 --> 02:02:25.635
I knew them all,
I know that's true.


1384
02:02:27.427 --> 02:02:29.885
Look, you've had a worse night
than any of us.


1385
02:02:30.010 --> 02:02:33.208
Why don't you go and find a doctor
and ask for one of his sleeping pills?


1386
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:36.877
Aren't you going to turn in, Gibby?

1387
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:40.048
No, I... I have
to write some letters first.
