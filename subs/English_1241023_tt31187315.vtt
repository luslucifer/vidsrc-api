Listen, we have a scheduled
meeting this morning.

I presume this is your sister.

Don't be silly, Virgil.

Let's get on with it, shall we?

I offer you the
Clashing Harmony.


359
00:14:27.689 --> 00:14:30.251
For this collection,
I was inspired


360
00:14:30.275 --> 00:14:36.007
by the flowing shapes of a
city, the evolving architecture


361
00:14:36.031 --> 00:14:40.261
that will leave him,
and the many colors

Just a warning, Diana.

to be taken seriously.

Sweet Charlotte.

1468

Her presence worked out to my,
how do you say, convenience.


1469
01:16:43.508 --> 01:16:48.596
After all, someone
had to take the blame.

And Ondine, that was
just another convenience?


1471
01:16:54.561 --> 01:16:58.874
Ondine's faux pas was that
she was a bit too nosy
