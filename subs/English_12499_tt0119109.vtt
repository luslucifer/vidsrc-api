1
00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:15.163
* He's just a young boy *

2
00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.667
* Lookin' for a way
to find love *


3
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.871
* It isn't easy *

4
00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:27.208
* Nothin' you can say
will help him *


5
00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:29.544
* Find love *

6
00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:30.879
* He's got to do it *

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.214
* For himself *

8
00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:37.418
* And it can take
so long *


9
00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:39.154
* He's just a young boy *

10
00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:42.458
* Lookin' for a way
to find love *


11
00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:46.928
* Find love *

12
00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.364
* A perfect combination *

13
00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:50.465
* Find love *

14
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.334
* Whatever you do *

15
00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:54.669
* Find love *

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.072
* A cause
for celebration *


17
00:00:57.073 --> 00:00:59.307
* And it might
come lookin' *


18
00:00:59.308 --> 00:01:01.442
* Lookin' *

19
00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:05.748
* Come lookin' for you *

20
00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:07.817
* Yeah *

21
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.742
* Find love *

22
00:01:34.743 --> 00:01:37.445
* In any situation *

23
00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:38.814
* Find love *

24
00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.282
* Whatever you do *

25
00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:43.218
* Find love *

26
00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.220
* A cause
for celebration *


27
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:48.323
* And it might
come lookin' *


28
00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:49.457
* Lookin' *

29
00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:53.495
* Come lookin' for you *

30
00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:56.832
* He doesn't need *

31
00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:00.402
* Another helping hand
from someone *


32
00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:04.940
* But don't you think *

33
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:08.576
* He doesn't understand
what he wants *


34
00:02:08.577 --> 00:02:11.146
* Someone *

35
00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:14.916
* Though independence
means a lot *


36
00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:19.520
* He's got
to still be strong *


37
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:21.322
* He's just a young boy *

38
00:02:21.323 --> 00:02:24.392
* Lookin' for a way
to find love *


39
00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:25.427
* Yeah *

40
00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:41.176
* Find love *

41
00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:44.479
* A time for meditation *

42
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.181
* Find love *

43
00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:49.951
* A source
of inspiration *


44
00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:51.987
* Find love *

45
00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:55.456
* Instead
of confrontation *


46
00:02:55.457 --> 00:02:58.026
* Find love *

47
00:02:58.027 --> 00:03:00.495
* And love will come *

48
00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:04.366
* Lookin' for you *

49
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.445
I think that would be
excellent lawyering
on your part.


50
00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:19.180
So, what do you think,

51
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.517
about 90 cents
on the dollar?


52
00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:23.551
Jack?

53
00:03:23.552 --> 00:03:24.752
90 cents on the dollar.

54
00:03:24.753 --> 00:03:26.454
I think that would
be fair.


55
00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:27.289
Uh, yeah.

56
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.724
Let's do this
after lunch, ok?


57
00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:32.994
So how long
has it been?


58
00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:34.662
17 years.

59
00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:35.696
Wow.

60
00:03:35.697 --> 00:03:36.932
Wow. Hello.

61
00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:38.166
Yeah.

62
00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:39.068
Hmm!

63
00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.036
I suppose you're
married now, huh?


64
00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:42.470
Yeah. 8 years.

65
00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:43.339
Oh.

66
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.306
Yep, 4 years
for the first wife,


67
00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:47.308
3 years
for the second wife,


68
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.445
and this one
a year so far.


69
00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:51.947
How about you?

70
00:03:51.948 --> 00:03:53.814
Yeah, I married
soon after we broke up.


71
00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:54.849
Really?

72
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.951
Mm-hmm. Any kids?

73
00:03:55.952 --> 00:03:58.886
No. No, no, no.
Not for me.


74
00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:00.422
And you?

75
00:04:01.423 --> 00:04:04.425
Uh, yeah. A son.
Scott. He's 16.


76
00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:05.461
Wow.

77
00:04:06.828 --> 00:04:08.897
He's yours.

78
00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:23.544
Is that a joke?

79
00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:24.912
Oh, no. He's your son.

80
00:04:24.913 --> 00:04:25.947
My son?

81
00:04:25.948 --> 00:04:26.982
Yes.

82
00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:28.483
I just never
said anything


83
00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:30.085
because by the time

84
00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:32.020
I found out
I was pregnant,


85
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:33.288
we had broken up,

86
00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.490
and I was in love
with Bob,


87
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:36.524
my husband.

88
00:04:36.525 --> 00:04:38.059
I married him and...

89
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.327
he thinks Scott
is his.


90
00:04:39.328 --> 00:04:41.662
How do you know
that he isn't?


91
00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:42.897
Well, I know.

92
00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:44.565
I know.

93
00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:46.367
I did the math.

94
00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:48.369
Well, not to demean
your math skills,


95
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.272
but don't you think
we should do this
the right way?


96
00:04:51.273 --> 00:04:53.274
You know,
blood tests, DNA.


97
00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:55.276
And why are you
telling me now


98
00:04:55.277 --> 00:04:57.678
after all of this time,
by the way?


99
00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:59.614
Scott ran away

100
00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:00.648
Bob...

101
00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:01.682
The husband?

102
00:05:01.683 --> 00:05:02.817
Yeah.

103
00:05:02.818 --> 00:05:05.353
Scott and Bob
had a terrible fight.


104
00:05:05.354 --> 00:05:07.555
Bob kept saying
he'd be back,


105
00:05:07.556 --> 00:05:08.956
but it's--

106
00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:11.693
it's been 2 weeks,
and we haven't...


107
00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:16.864
Do you have any idea
where he went?


108
00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:18.266
No.

109
00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:20.501
He ran away
with this girl
he was seeing--


110
00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:22.037
Nikki Trainor.

111
00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:23.304
Her parents
are divorced.


112
00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:25.506
Her father lives
in San Francisco.


113
00:05:25.507 --> 00:05:27.042
He...

114
00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:28.543
works in
a towing service.


115
00:05:28.544 --> 00:05:29.677
Tip
-Top Towing.

116
00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:31.212
Tip
-Top Towing?

117
00:05:31.213 --> 00:05:32.947
Well, when we called,

118
00:05:32.948 --> 00:05:34.482
he wouldn't even speak
to us.


119
00:05:34.483 --> 00:05:36.585
He wouldn't even speak
to the police.


120
00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:39.421
Do you have a picture?

121
00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:41.822
Of Scotty?

122
00:05:41.823 --> 00:05:43.291
Yeah.

123
00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:44.326
Oh.

124
00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:58.207
You can see
the resemblance,
right?


125
00:06:01.443 --> 00:06:04.479
Well, it's the wrong
expression.


126
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.147
When he smiles,
he's you.


127
00:06:06.148 --> 00:06:08.483
Do you have a picture
of him smiling?


128
00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:10.017
Well, sorry.

129
00:06:10.018 --> 00:06:11.852
I... I...

130
00:06:11.853 --> 00:06:14.689
wish there was something
or anything that I could do.


131
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.557
You can find him.

132
00:06:16.558 --> 00:06:19.428
Me? I don't find people.
I sue them.


133
00:06:21.363 --> 00:06:23.464
To whom it may concern.

134
00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:26.401
For years I've thought
about killing myself--


135
00:06:26.402 --> 00:06:29.270
It's the only thing
that's kept me going--


136
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.473
but something
always held me back.


137
00:06:32.474 --> 00:06:34.243
My writing.

138
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:43.918
Good-bye...

139
00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.254
my life's work.

140
00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:48.590
Au revoir, oeuvre.

141
00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:52.161
Ciao, caca.

142
00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:00.569
2 bullets
should be enough.


143
00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:12.047
Aah!

144
00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:21.490
Hello.

145
00:07:23.892 --> 00:07:25.527
Who's this?

146
00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:29.531
Collette?

147
00:07:30.932 --> 00:07:33.568
Collette Richard?

148
00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:35.570
Oh, my God.

149
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:37.606
How are you?

150
00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:40.675
Oh, me?

151
00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:42.477
Oh, I'm not bad.

152
00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:44.011
Tomorrow?

153
00:07:44.012 --> 00:07:46.582
Well, you know,
I made no plans.


154
00:07:49.618 --> 00:07:51.519
It's one face.

155
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.553
Oh.

156
00:07:52.554 --> 00:07:53.789
I have a son.

157
00:07:55.957 --> 00:07:57.958
Oh, God.

158
00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:59.594
Dale...

159
00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:00.961
Ohh...

160
00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:02.564
I'm ok.

161
00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:05.266
Just tell me
about Scotty.


162
00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:06.967
When can I see him?

163
00:08:06.968 --> 00:08:09.904
Dale, Scott is missing.

164
00:08:09.905 --> 00:08:11.339
My son is missing?

165
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.741
We think he's up here.

166
00:08:13.742 --> 00:08:15.176
Here in San Francisco?

167
00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:18.746
Since you live here,
and you were always
so understanding...


168
00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:20.315
Oh, psychic sometimes.

169
00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:22.983
But you really seem
to have a full plate.


170
00:08:22.984 --> 00:08:24.985
Collette...

171
00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:27.588
I know I seem a little...

172
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:29.156
fuzzy...

173
00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:31.427
but I can focus.

174
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.028
Let me try this.

175
00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:36.632
I can do it.

176
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.536
My son needs me.

177
00:08:43.205 --> 00:08:45.340
Don't you worry, Scotty.

178
00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:47.408
Daddy's coming.

179
00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:49.377
Why didn't somebody
call me


180
00:08:49.378 --> 00:08:51.379
before I left
Los Angeles?


181
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.813
Because we didn't know,
Jack.


182
00:08:52.814 --> 00:08:55.015
My client showed up here

183
00:08:55.016 --> 00:08:56.817
then said his cast
was too tight.


184
00:08:56.818 --> 00:08:58.819
He was in terrible pain,
and he had to go home.


185
00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.854
Terrible pain.

186
00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:01.922
It's true. He'll be
all right by tomorrow.


187
00:09:01.923 --> 00:09:03.224
Yes, but I am here
today.


188
00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:04.459
I know.
I'm sorry.


189
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.394
Rose will book you
into a hotel overnight.


190
00:09:06.395 --> 00:09:08.162
Where do you
like to stay?


191
00:09:08.163 --> 00:09:11.633
My house, but it's
in Los Angeles.


192
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.103
Hello.

193
00:09:16.104 --> 00:09:17.738
Jack: Hi, honey.

194
00:09:17.739 --> 00:09:19.540
Oh, what's wrong?

195
00:09:19.541 --> 00:09:21.276
Yeah, we have
a little problem.


196
00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:23.311
I have to stay over
tonight. I'm sorry.


197
00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:24.512
You gonna be ok?

198
00:09:24.513 --> 00:09:26.046
Yeah, I'll be fine.

199
00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:28.316
I'm just taking care of
stuff around the house.


200
00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:30.117
All right.
I'll call you later. Bye.


201
00:09:30.118 --> 00:09:31.553
Ok, bye.

202
00:09:34.956 --> 00:09:37.593
Ok, let's see.

203
00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:47.067
Do you have
a phone book?


204
00:09:47.068 --> 00:09:49.169
Hi, Scott...

205
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.273
I'm your dad.

206
00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:54.909
Hi, Scotty.

207
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.943
Oh!

208
00:09:55.944 --> 00:09:57.445
Good firm handshake.

209
00:09:57.446 --> 00:10:00.381
Scotty, how ya doin'?

210
00:10:00.382 --> 00:10:03.285
Dude, I'm your old man.

211
00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:05.520
I suppose
you're wondering


212
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.622
why your middle name
is Rainbow.


213
00:10:07.623 --> 00:10:09.256
Yo, Scott.

214
00:10:09.257 --> 00:10:10.758
What's up, homes?

215
00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:12.327
You know, Scott,

216
00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:14.094
when I was a boy
your age,


217
00:10:14.095 --> 00:10:16.997
I was pulling on myself
harder than a tractor pull
in Arkansas.


218
00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:18.065
* I'm your papa *

219
00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:19.099
* Your daddy *

220
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.435
* Your pal *

221
00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:22.337
* You got to care for me,
you see? *


222
00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:24.372
I am your father.

223
00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:25.773
Hug me...

224
00:10:25.774 --> 00:10:27.842
and let us join
our spirits.


225
00:10:27.843 --> 00:10:29.610
Mr Trainor?

226
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:30.512
What?

227
00:10:30.513 --> 00:10:32.246
Hi, my name
is Jack Lawrence.


228
00:10:32.247 --> 00:10:33.280
So?

229
00:10:33.281 --> 00:10:34.849
So, I was hoping

230
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.017
that maybe you could
help me with something.


231
00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:39.053
Have you seen this boy?

232
00:10:39.054 --> 00:10:41.088
This again. Who are you?

233
00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:43.057
I'm, uh...

234
00:10:43.058 --> 00:10:44.325
I'm his father.

235
00:10:44.326 --> 00:10:46.327
Well, what are you
bothering me for?


236
00:10:46.328 --> 00:10:48.195
I already talked to
your wife on the phone.


237
00:10:48.196 --> 00:10:50.798
Oh, no. She's not my wife.
She--she's--listen,
that's not even the point.


238
00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:53.000
The point is I don't
know anything,


239
00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:54.636
so get lost.

240
00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:58.907
When was the last time
that you saw him?


241
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:02.176
Look, I'm tired
of this bullshit,
all right?


242
00:11:02.177 --> 00:11:03.944
Now, just get the hell
out of here.


243
00:11:03.945 --> 00:11:04.979
I'll get it. Hello?

244
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.847
Give me that.

245
00:11:05.848 --> 00:11:07.348
No, he can't.
He's in a meeting.


246
00:11:07.349 --> 00:11:08.784
What is wrong with you?

247
00:11:14.656 --> 00:11:17.191
Hello? Listen, he can't
speak right now.


248
00:11:17.192 --> 00:11:20.260
No, he's having
a lot of trouble
with his testicles.


249
00:11:20.261 --> 00:11:22.229
I will tell him. Bye.

250
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.264
That was your mother
on the phone.


251
00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:25.866
Come on, now.

252
00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:27.267
There you go.

253
00:11:27.268 --> 00:11:28.302
You're gonna be ok.

254
00:11:28.303 --> 00:11:30.004
Sit there. All right.

255
00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:31.038
All right.

256
00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.072
All right.

257
00:11:32.073 --> 00:11:33.974
Ok. Come on.

258
00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:35.743
Everything's gonna be ok.

259
00:11:35.744 --> 00:11:38.779
What were we talking about?
You know, I just--


260
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.916
oh, right, right, right.
Your daughter and my son.


261
00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:43.150
Yeah, um...

262
00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:46.253
All right, they were here
with a bunch of other kids.


263
00:11:46.254 --> 00:11:47.287
Good. Good.

264
00:11:47.288 --> 00:11:49.023
And?

265
00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:51.291
And now they're gone.

266
00:11:51.292 --> 00:11:53.828
And where did they go?

267
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:57.966
Nikki said something
about trying to get money
from my ex-wife and...


268
00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:01.035
And she would be?

269
00:12:01.036 --> 00:12:04.171
The lady that runs
the marina in Tiberon.


270
00:12:04.172 --> 00:12:06.206
What's her name,
Bosco?


271
00:12:06.207 --> 00:12:07.241
Shirley.

272
00:12:07.242 --> 00:12:08.275
Shirley's marina.

273
00:12:08.276 --> 00:12:10.044
Shirley's marina
in Tiberon.


274
00:12:10.045 --> 00:12:11.813
Thank you very, very much.

275
00:12:15.316 --> 00:12:17.317
Oh, excuse me.
Mr Trainor?


276
00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:19.019
No, that's not me.

277
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.054
Oh, no?

278
00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:21.321
Uh, he's in there.

279
00:12:21.322 --> 00:12:22.957
Oh, thank you.

280
00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.560
Ok. Ok.

281
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.361
Sheesh.

282
00:12:27.362 --> 00:12:29.396
Hey, can I get a cab
out front?


283
00:12:29.397 --> 00:12:30.431
Oh, yeah.

284
00:12:30.432 --> 00:12:31.466
Hey, nice shot.

285
00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:32.701
Thanks a lot.

286
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.304
Mr Trainor?

287
00:12:37.305 --> 00:12:38.806
Yeah?

288
00:12:38.807 --> 00:12:41.876
I hope I'm not catching you
at an inconvenient moment.


289
00:12:41.877 --> 00:12:45.580
Ahem. I won't
waste an extra minute
of your valuable time.


290
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:47.516
Have you seen
this handsome boy?


291
00:12:50.285 --> 00:12:52.086
Who--who are you?

292
00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:54.421
Isn't it obvious?

293
00:12:54.422 --> 00:12:56.256
I'm his father.

294
00:12:56.257 --> 00:12:59.326
I understand that, uh,
he and your daughter are,


295
00:12:59.327 --> 00:13:01.862
shall we say, an item.

296
00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:04.364
Oh, they grow up so fast,
don't they?


297
00:13:04.365 --> 00:13:05.900
I mean, one minute,

298
00:13:05.901 --> 00:13:08.068
there you're going
"Who's the little boy?"


299
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:11.138
And the next minute
he's banging
your little girl.


300
00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:12.406
May I sit down?

301
00:13:12.407 --> 00:13:14.009
Sure.

302
00:13:16.978 --> 00:13:20.247
So, how many fathers
does this kid have?


303
00:13:20.248 --> 00:13:21.281
Oh...

304
00:13:21.282 --> 00:13:22.683
No. I see.

305
00:13:22.684 --> 00:13:26.320
No, the man you met
is not the real father.


306
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.524
I'm the real father.

307
00:13:29.357 --> 00:13:30.891
See, it's a long story.

308
00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:34.129
17 years ago,
we were biking
through the wine--


309
00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:42.837
The mother and I were,
you know,


310
00:13:42.838 --> 00:13:44.439
biking through
the wine country.


311
00:13:45.473 --> 00:13:46.874
It began to rain
a little--


312
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:49.176
Please,
you answer the phone.


313
00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:50.846
I'll finish my story
after.


314
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.247
Ow! What the--

315
00:13:53.248 --> 00:13:54.381
Wait! I'm sorry!

316
00:13:54.382 --> 00:13:56.350
Get the hell
out of here!


317
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:57.818
What's that all about?!

318
00:13:57.819 --> 00:13:59.119
Oh!

319
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.021
My God!

320
00:14:01.022 --> 00:14:02.389
That man is insane!

321
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.625
He just bludgeoned me
with a phone


322
00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:05.826
for no reason!

323
00:14:05.827 --> 00:14:07.995
He's a bad guy.
Are you ok?


324
00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:09.897
I don't know.
Is there blood?


325
00:14:09.898 --> 00:14:10.931
No.

326
00:14:10.932 --> 00:14:11.932
Good.

327
00:14:11.933 --> 00:14:13.868
I was just telling him
this lovely story


328
00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:15.903
about me and a girl
biking through
the wine country.


329
00:14:15.904 --> 00:14:18.072
Hey, those stories
aren't for everybody,
pal.


330
00:14:18.073 --> 00:14:18.907
I guess not.

331
00:14:18.908 --> 00:14:20.841
I have to talk
to him, though.


332
00:14:20.842 --> 00:14:22.943
I'm trying to find
my son.


333
00:14:22.944 --> 00:14:24.344
Your son?

334
00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:25.581
Yeah.

335
00:14:26.414 --> 00:14:28.650
He ran away.

336
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.488
Your son ran away?

337
00:14:34.489 --> 00:14:36.356
Yeah.

338
00:14:36.357 --> 00:14:37.926
So did mine.

339
00:14:39.094 --> 00:14:40.895
How richly bizarre.

340
00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:42.429
They could be together.

341
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.964
You think so?

342
00:14:43.965 --> 00:14:47.603
He said there's
a whole group of them.


343
00:14:48.436 --> 00:14:49.738
Dale Putley.

344
00:14:51.272 --> 00:14:52.439
Jack Lawrence.

345
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.710
Do you know
where Tiberon is?


346
00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:04.118
Jack: Dale, I feel like
I'm in a white Bronco.


347
00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:05.185
Dale: I'm sorry.

348
00:15:05.186 --> 00:15:07.187
I just get anxious
driving over bridges.


349
00:15:07.188 --> 00:15:09.356
That's because you're
going 11 miles an hour.


350
00:15:09.357 --> 00:15:11.425
I'm going 25 miles
an hour, Jack.


351
00:15:11.426 --> 00:15:13.293
Yeah, I can feel
the g-force.


352
00:15:13.294 --> 00:15:14.328
What?

353
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:15.362
What?!

354
00:15:15.363 --> 00:15:16.396
Son--

355
00:15:16.397 --> 00:15:17.531
Calm down.

356
00:15:17.532 --> 00:15:19.867
I'm ok. It's just
all these people.


357
00:15:19.868 --> 00:15:22.469
I don't like
a lot of people
or a lot of cars.


358
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.938
What do you do
for a living?


359
00:15:23.939 --> 00:15:24.873
Well...

360
00:15:24.874 --> 00:15:27.141
I teach English
as a third language


361
00:15:27.142 --> 00:15:29.310
at the Jewish
Community Centre.


362
00:15:31.312 --> 00:15:32.614
Excuse me!

363
00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:36.116
I'm really sort of a...

364
00:15:36.117 --> 00:15:37.584
writer at large.

365
00:15:37.585 --> 00:15:40.855
I write and perform
poetry and plays.


366
00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:43.023
Things from my soul.

367
00:15:43.024 --> 00:15:44.058
Ah. Really?

368
00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:45.059
Yeah.

369
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.961
But it's avant-garde.
Very experimental.


370
00:15:46.962 --> 00:15:49.163
You mean like
with guinea pigs and--


371
00:15:49.164 --> 00:15:52.099
you're not a mime,
are you, because I...


372
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.934
I used to be.

373
00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:54.902
Oh, you did?
Oh, I'm sorry.


374
00:15:54.903 --> 00:15:56.236
Well, what? No, please.

375
00:15:56.237 --> 00:15:57.205
Nothing. Just...

376
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.306
Oh, no, no. Tell me.
It's ok. I can...


377
00:15:59.307 --> 00:16:00.975
I hate them.

378
00:16:00.976 --> 00:16:03.944
I see the mime on the street,
I want to kick him in the face,
I'll tell you.


379
00:16:03.945 --> 00:16:05.245
Really?

380
00:16:05.246 --> 00:16:07.147
You should
talk to somebody
about that, Jack.


381
00:16:07.148 --> 00:16:08.182
They're annoying.

382
00:16:08.183 --> 00:16:09.216
Really?

383
00:16:09.217 --> 00:16:11.051
If I go out shopping
or something,


384
00:16:11.052 --> 00:16:12.853
he's got a balloon,
it's like--


385
00:16:12.854 --> 00:16:14.154
What do you do?

386
00:16:14.155 --> 00:16:15.890
And I just want
to smack him.


387
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.725
What do I do?
I'm a lawyer.


388
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:18.759
Bloodsucker.

389
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.794
Uh, I'm sorry. What?

390
00:16:19.795 --> 00:16:21.328
I didn't hear
what you said.


391
00:16:21.329 --> 00:16:22.362
Right here.

392
00:16:22.363 --> 00:16:23.397
The throat.

393
00:16:23.398 --> 00:16:24.431
Sorry.

394
00:16:24.432 --> 00:16:26.166
Dale?

395
00:16:26.167 --> 00:16:27.201
What?

396
00:16:27.202 --> 00:16:28.468
You missed the exit.

397
00:16:28.469 --> 00:16:29.870
Oh, I what?

398
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:31.471
All this
pithy conversation,


399
00:16:31.472 --> 00:16:32.873
and we missed the exit.

400
00:16:32.874 --> 00:16:35.309
You have to go off
and come back around.


401
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.343
Ohh...

402
00:16:36.344 --> 00:16:37.378
Oh.

403
00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:42.383
Oh.

404
00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:44.953
Dale!

405
00:16:44.954 --> 00:16:46.854
What are you doing?!
What was that?!


406
00:16:46.855 --> 00:16:47.955
Oh! I'm sorry.

407
00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:49.757
I turn around,
and you blacked out!


408
00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:50.791
I'm sorry.

409
00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:51.826
What was that?!

410
00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:52.860
In crisis situations,

411
00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:54.461
I have these
anxiety attacks,


412
00:16:54.462 --> 00:16:55.730
and I hyperventilate,

413
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:57.464
and I pass out
for a moment.


414
00:16:57.465 --> 00:16:58.498
Sorry. I'm back.

415
00:16:58.499 --> 00:16:59.935
Whew.

416
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.938
Jack: So have you
been driving long?


417
00:17:03.939 --> 00:17:05.172
About 30 years now.

418
00:17:05.173 --> 00:17:07.407
Oh, listen,
these things take time.


419
00:17:07.408 --> 00:17:09.409
Here. Pull in here.

420
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.412
Yeah, brake, brake, br--

421
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.148
Perfect.

422
00:17:14.149 --> 00:17:16.050
Anchovies. I gave you
the shrimp, right?


423
00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:16.885
Yeah.

424
00:17:16.886 --> 00:17:18.118
Here are the pile worms.

425
00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.354
Gentlemen,
have a good time.


426
00:17:20.355 --> 00:17:21.756
Catch some fish.

427
00:17:21.757 --> 00:17:22.990
Mrs Trainor?

428
00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:23.825
Yes.

429
00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:25.325
Hi, my name
is Jack Lawrence.


430
00:17:25.326 --> 00:17:27.194
Can I talk to you
for just a moment?


431
00:17:27.195 --> 00:17:28.628
Yeah, yeah.

432
00:17:28.629 --> 00:17:31.198
Listen, Pepe,
don't start on that till
I get over there, ok?


433
00:17:31.199 --> 00:17:32.933
I'm Dale Putley.
How do you do?


434
00:17:32.934 --> 00:17:34.201
Shirley: Fine.
What do you want?


435
00:17:34.202 --> 00:17:36.003
It's about
your daughter Nikki.


436
00:17:36.004 --> 00:17:38.038
Dale: Your ex-husband
told us to talk to you.


437
00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:39.740
Oh, God.
What'd she do now?


438
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:41.241
Oh, we're not
looking for Nikki.


439
00:17:41.242 --> 00:17:43.277
We're trying to find
our 2 boys.


440
00:17:43.278 --> 00:17:45.579
Yeah, we think
that they're moving


441
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.847
in your daughter's
social circle.


442
00:17:46.848 --> 00:17:47.882
Listen to me.

443
00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:49.884
I don't know
where Nikki is.


444
00:17:49.885 --> 00:17:52.352
Frankly,
I don't want to know.


445
00:17:52.353 --> 00:17:53.989
But we're...

446
00:17:58.226 --> 00:18:00.227
How'd you get her husband
to talk?


447
00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:02.429
I head-butted him
in the face.


448
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.998
How Joe Pesci of you.

449
00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:05.833
What are you gonna do
with her,


450
00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:07.868
run her tits
through the Visa machine?


451
00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:11.472
Hey, listen,
how about crying again?


452
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.941
Me?

453
00:18:13.942 --> 00:18:16.944
Yeah. It might reach
her maternal thing.


454
00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:18.813
Cry just like that?

455
00:18:18.814 --> 00:18:20.580
You cried when we missed
the exit.


456
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:21.615
Don't mock me.

457
00:18:21.616 --> 00:18:22.649
Listen, Chip--

458
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:23.683
Dale.

459
00:18:23.684 --> 00:18:25.052
Dale.

460
00:18:25.053 --> 00:18:26.954
You're an actor, right?
You're a performer.


461
00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:29.023
Let's make believe
that it's a play--


462
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:30.858
A very sad play.
A tragic play.


463
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:32.860
You're a tragic hero.
You're...


464
00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:34.394
You're Lou Gehrig.

465
00:18:34.395 --> 00:18:35.429
Who's that?

466
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.463
Lou Gehrig.

467
00:18:36.464 --> 00:18:37.497
Lou Gehrig.

468
00:18:37.498 --> 00:18:38.866
Everybody
knows Lou Gehrig.


469
00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:39.934
The baseball player.

470
00:18:39.935 --> 00:18:41.902
He died of Lou Gehrig's
Disease.


471
00:18:41.903 --> 00:18:44.404
Wow. What are the odds
on that?


472
00:18:44.405 --> 00:18:45.940
Oh, boy.

473
00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:47.241
Here's what I need:

474
00:18:47.242 --> 00:18:49.243
I need tears,
and I need them quickly.


475
00:18:49.244 --> 00:18:51.245
She's gonna come back.
Come on.


476
00:18:51.246 --> 00:18:52.279
I'll try.

477
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.513
Do it.

478
00:18:53.514 --> 00:18:56.283
Just need to find
something personal
from my past.


479
00:18:56.284 --> 00:18:58.185
At the actor's studio,
they call it sense memory.


480
00:18:58.186 --> 00:18:59.219
Wow.

481
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.254
Ok.

482
00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:01.089
Ok.

483
00:19:04.392 --> 00:19:05.861
Come on.

484
00:19:06.794 --> 00:19:08.997
That's nice. Good.

485
00:19:13.434 --> 00:19:15.436
Wow. That's fantastic.

486
00:19:17.005 --> 00:19:18.439
What are you doing?

487
00:19:19.474 --> 00:19:20.875
What are you doing?

488
00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:22.877
I'm at my grandmother's
funeral.


489
00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:24.912
Well, sorry
I wasn't there.


490
00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:26.313
Oh, it was great.

491
00:19:26.314 --> 00:19:27.814
Jack: Cut it out.
She's here.


492
00:19:27.815 --> 00:19:29.284
Why are you still here?

493
00:19:30.785 --> 00:19:31.818
Well...

494
00:19:31.819 --> 00:19:33.420
What's wrong with him?

495
00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:35.389
Him? He's...

496
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.224
He's upset.

497
00:19:37.458 --> 00:19:39.159
He's distraught.

498
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.995
Crying?

499
00:19:39.996 --> 00:19:41.428
Crying? He's weeping.

500
00:19:41.429 --> 00:19:42.462
Why?

501
00:19:42.463 --> 00:19:43.497
Why?

502
00:19:43.498 --> 00:19:44.865
It's his son.

503
00:19:44.866 --> 00:19:47.301
His son is his life.
His whole life.


504
00:19:47.302 --> 00:19:49.303
You know, we come here
looking for help,


505
00:19:49.304 --> 00:19:51.338
and you with your
big city ways,


506
00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:53.640
you crush his last hope
of ever finding him again.


507
00:19:53.641 --> 00:19:55.409
Y-yeah-ha-ha.

508
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.977
Ow... my boy, my boy.

509
00:19:56.978 --> 00:19:58.245
I don't know.

510
00:19:58.246 --> 00:20:00.280
Come on, you're ripping
his heart out.


511
00:20:00.281 --> 00:20:02.249
Listen, my daughter
could get into trouble.


512
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.484
No, no.
We'll keep it private.


513
00:20:04.485 --> 00:20:06.020
Strictly
in the family.


514
00:20:06.021 --> 00:20:07.821
Yeah, from one parent
to another.


515
00:20:07.822 --> 00:20:08.855
To another.

516
00:20:08.856 --> 00:20:09.924
Whew.

517
00:20:09.925 --> 00:20:12.193
They're probably
with Sugar Ray.


518
00:20:13.228 --> 00:20:14.494
The boxer?

519
00:20:14.495 --> 00:20:15.762
No, it's a rock band.

520
00:20:15.763 --> 00:20:18.933
Nikki and some
of the other kids
travel all over


521
00:20:18.934 --> 00:20:20.200
following them around.

522
00:20:20.201 --> 00:20:22.036
Dale: They're in
San Francisco then?


523
00:20:22.037 --> 00:20:23.938
Where are they playing?

524
00:20:23.939 --> 00:20:26.240
They were, and then Nikki
came over a couple days ago


525
00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:28.275
and said she was taking off
to Sacramento.


526
00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:30.377
They're playing a club
called, uh, The Temple.


527
00:20:30.378 --> 00:20:31.411
The Temple?

528
00:20:31.412 --> 00:20:32.446
Yes.

529
00:20:32.447 --> 00:20:33.480
In Sacramento.

530
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:34.315
Sugar Ray.

531
00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:35.882
Thank you
very, very much.


532
00:20:35.883 --> 00:20:36.917
You're welcome.

533
00:20:36.918 --> 00:20:38.153
Thank you.

534
00:20:41.222 --> 00:20:44.324
Look,
if you see Nikki,


535
00:20:44.325 --> 00:20:47.562
tell her to call me
if she needs anything.


536
00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:54.868
At the risk of sounding
a little pretentious,


537
00:20:54.869 --> 00:20:56.270
I want to share
with you


538
00:20:56.271 --> 00:20:58.705
a line from one
of my unproduced plays.


539
00:20:58.706 --> 00:20:59.906
Oh, no.

540
00:20:59.907 --> 00:21:01.908
"The amazing thing
about a parent's love


541
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:03.310
"is that something
so large


542
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:05.413
can so often
go unseen."


543
00:21:06.914 --> 00:21:07.948
That's beautiful.

544
00:21:07.949 --> 00:21:09.284
Thank you.

545
00:21:13.221 --> 00:21:15.990
Look, what do
they look like,
your sons?


546
00:21:15.991 --> 00:21:17.992
If they were with Nikki,
I probably met them.


547
00:21:17.993 --> 00:21:19.726
Do you have a picture?

548
00:21:19.727 --> 00:21:21.461
Yeah. I have a picture.

549
00:21:21.462 --> 00:21:22.829
Yeah, I did.

550
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.863
There he is.

551
00:21:23.864 --> 00:21:25.465
Shirley:
Well, he's handsome.


552
00:21:25.466 --> 00:21:26.500
Thank you.

553
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:28.735
This is my guy.

554
00:21:28.736 --> 00:21:31.272
What is this, a joke?

555
00:21:40.448 --> 00:21:41.982
Scott.

556
00:21:41.983 --> 00:21:43.451
Scott.

557
00:21:44.285 --> 00:21:46.754
That bitch!
That bitch!


558
00:21:49.457 --> 00:21:50.490
Hello?

559
00:21:50.491 --> 00:21:51.558
Jack: Collette?

560
00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:52.592
Aah!

561
00:21:52.593 --> 00:21:53.927
Guess who.

562
00:21:53.928 --> 00:21:55.229
Yes, that's right.

563
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.963
Guess where I am.

564
00:21:56.964 --> 00:21:58.232
No, I'm in San Francisco.

565
00:21:58.233 --> 00:22:00.467
And guess who I'm with.

566
00:22:00.468 --> 00:22:02.002
Oh, God.

567
00:22:02.003 --> 00:22:03.071
I'll give you a hint.

568
00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:05.372
Don't do that!

569
00:22:05.373 --> 00:22:07.407
She got it in a second.
Wasn't even a pause.


570
00:22:07.408 --> 00:22:08.276
Oh, thank you.

571
00:22:08.277 --> 00:22:10.110
What the hell
is going on, huh?


572
00:22:10.111 --> 00:22:11.345
How could you do this?

573
00:22:11.346 --> 00:22:13.213
How could you tell us both
the same story?


574
00:22:13.214 --> 00:22:14.248
Oh, I'm so hurt!

575
00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:15.715
It's not a story.

576
00:22:15.716 --> 00:22:17.817
Collette,
who is the father?


577
00:22:17.818 --> 00:22:19.019
Is it me, Bob,
or...


578
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.054
Dale!

579
00:22:20.055 --> 00:22:21.188
Dale?

580
00:22:21.189 --> 00:22:23.223
Look, the truth
is I don't know, ok?


581
00:22:23.224 --> 00:22:25.292
I knew all 3 of you
then.


582
00:22:25.293 --> 00:22:27.261
Any of you could be
his father.


583
00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:28.828
Please, just find him.

584
00:22:28.829 --> 00:22:31.031
I mean, find him,
and we can settle it
later.


585
00:22:31.032 --> 00:22:32.532
Oh, that really helps.

586
00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:33.933
Good-bye.

587
00:22:33.934 --> 00:22:35.302
What did she say?

588
00:22:35.303 --> 00:22:39.140
She said
she's not sure.


589
00:22:42.377 --> 00:22:46.013
You don't know
who Scott's father is?


590
00:22:46.847 --> 00:22:48.248
When did you meet her?

591
00:22:48.249 --> 00:22:49.949
At a baseball game.

592
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:50.984
Mm-hmm.

593
00:22:50.985 --> 00:22:52.018
You?

594
00:22:52.019 --> 00:22:54.322
Up here at Berkeley.

595
00:22:55.756 --> 00:22:57.491
Ahh, Collette.

596
00:22:57.492 --> 00:22:58.825
Oh, that accent.

597
00:22:58.826 --> 00:22:59.859
Mmm.

598
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.894
Mouth.

599
00:23:00.895 --> 00:23:03.897
I tell you,
she was just so...


600
00:23:03.898 --> 00:23:05.533
Stimulating.

601
00:23:08.136 --> 00:23:09.569
The first date...

602
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.905
I just stared at her
the whole night.


603
00:23:11.906 --> 00:23:13.140
She was that stunning.

604
00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:15.175
In the moonlight,
with that skin.


605
00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:17.244
I didn't even touch her.

606
00:23:17.245 --> 00:23:19.414
I took nude photographs
of her.


607
00:23:20.815 --> 00:23:22.116
She posed nude for you?

608
00:23:22.117 --> 00:23:23.417
Yeah.

609
00:23:23.418 --> 00:23:26.052
It was photography class.
It was extra credit.


610
00:23:26.053 --> 00:23:27.321
Wow.

611
00:23:27.322 --> 00:23:29.823
All she ever did for me
was have sex.


612
00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:32.626
Mmm. We did that, too,
but I've got some negatives.


613
00:23:32.627 --> 00:23:33.927
Wow.

614
00:23:33.928 --> 00:23:35.929
It was Berkeley.
You know.


615
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.931
I took nude pictures
of her,


616
00:23:37.932 --> 00:23:40.200
she took nude pictures
of me.


617
00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:42.769
Her roommate
took nude pictures
of the both of us.


618
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.339
Then I took nude pictures
of her and her roommate


619
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.110
wrestling on a slip-n-slide,
coming at me like...


620
00:23:49.977 --> 00:23:52.180
Enjoy.

621
00:23:53.013 --> 00:23:54.047
Francene?

622
00:23:54.048 --> 00:23:55.382
Mm-hmm?

623
00:23:55.383 --> 00:23:57.917
Excuse me, but, um,
this has cheese on it.


624
00:23:57.918 --> 00:23:59.853
It's better
with cheese.


625
00:23:59.854 --> 00:24:01.221
I'm not conducting
a poll.


626
00:24:01.222 --> 00:24:03.190
You see,
I can't digest this.


627
00:24:03.191 --> 00:24:05.225
Cheese is no longer
my friend.


628
00:24:05.226 --> 00:24:07.261
If I eat this,
it's gonna be bad for me,


629
00:24:07.262 --> 00:24:08.862
and pretty much
everybody else


630
00:24:08.863 --> 00:24:10.664
on this side of the room,

631
00:24:10.665 --> 00:24:12.832
so could you give me
another one?


632
00:24:12.833 --> 00:24:13.867
Francene.

633
00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:14.901
Mm-hmm?

634
00:24:14.902 --> 00:24:16.970
Can you also
take this one,


635
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:18.838
and wrap both of them
to go, ok?


636
00:24:18.839 --> 00:24:20.207
Oh, and the check.

637
00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:22.142
Francene: Nothing would
give me greater pleasure.


638
00:24:22.143 --> 00:24:23.177
Thank you.

639
00:24:23.178 --> 00:24:25.212
Dale, where am I going?

640
00:24:25.213 --> 00:24:26.946
Sacramento,
where our son is.


641
00:24:26.947 --> 00:24:28.081
No, you don't
understand.


642
00:24:28.082 --> 00:24:29.483
We don't know
what's going on.


643
00:24:29.484 --> 00:24:31.485
She keeps telling us
different stories.


644
00:24:31.486 --> 00:24:33.119
Why are we running off
there?


645
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.688
We don't know
who the real father is.


646
00:24:34.689 --> 00:24:37.824
We won't know unless
we go there and find out
for ourselves.


647
00:24:37.825 --> 00:24:38.858
Francene: Thank you.

648
00:24:38.859 --> 00:24:39.959
Thank you,
Francene.


649
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.528
* Pick it up, pick it up *

650
00:24:41.529 --> 00:24:43.198
* Pick it up, pick it up *

651
00:24:53.908 --> 00:24:54.942
Aah!

652
00:24:55.976 --> 00:24:57.244
What is the matter?

653
00:24:57.245 --> 00:24:59.846
Will you do me a favour?

654
00:24:59.847 --> 00:25:01.681
Will you look back there

655
00:25:01.682 --> 00:25:04.451
and see if there's
a dead body in the road?


656
00:25:04.452 --> 00:25:05.485
What?

657
00:25:05.486 --> 00:25:06.521
Please.

658
00:25:08.923 --> 00:25:10.590
No, there's nothing there.

659
00:25:10.591 --> 00:25:12.926
There's not a body
lying in the road?


660
00:25:12.927 --> 00:25:14.160
A what?

661
00:25:14.161 --> 00:25:15.396
A body.

662
00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:32.045
No.

663
00:25:32.046 --> 00:25:33.214
Nothing there.

664
00:25:36.817 --> 00:25:38.218
Oh, good.

665
00:25:38.219 --> 00:25:39.986
I often think

666
00:25:39.987 --> 00:25:42.122
that I've run
someone over.


667
00:25:48.363 --> 00:25:50.430
* But now
I'll be on MTV *


668
00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:52.599
* A magazine
like Seventeen *


669
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.401
* Or Rolling Stone
or Mother Jones *


670
00:25:54.402 --> 00:25:55.735
* Put it in my pocket *

671
00:25:55.736 --> 00:25:57.938
* And my pic's
on your t-shirt, yeah *


672
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.040
I hope he's here.

673
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:02.242
Don't worry, Jack.

674
00:26:02.243 --> 00:26:04.143
Let me be your guide.
I know this world.


675
00:26:04.144 --> 00:26:05.179
Oh, yeah?

676
00:26:30.004 --> 00:26:31.605
Sorry.

677
00:26:31.606 --> 00:26:32.972
Excuse me.

678
00:26:32.973 --> 00:26:34.073
Sorry.

679
00:26:34.074 --> 00:26:35.443
Thanks.

680
00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:45.686
Excuse me.

681
00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:49.889
Let's split up.

682
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.124
No, Jack.
No, no, no.


683
00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:53.092
You'll be fine.
You go that way,
I'll go this way.


684
00:26:53.093 --> 00:26:54.160
No, Jack--

685
00:26:54.161 --> 00:26:55.429
Just ask if
they've seen Scott.


686
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.763
Ask if
I've seen Scott.


687
00:26:56.764 --> 00:26:57.998
Ok.
Ok?


688
00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:00.734
Excuse me!

689
00:27:00.735 --> 00:27:01.936
Pardon me!

690
00:27:03.471 --> 00:27:06.640
Excuse me, have you
seen this boy? Um...


691
00:27:06.641 --> 00:27:08.875
Have you seen this boy?

692
00:27:08.876 --> 00:27:10.477
No.
No.


693
00:27:10.478 --> 00:27:13.146
Have you--ohh!
Oh, my God!


694
00:27:13.147 --> 00:27:14.247
Ow! Ow!

695
00:27:14.248 --> 00:27:16.282
I'm sorry.
You all right?


696
00:27:16.283 --> 00:27:18.284
No, I'm not all right.
Will you get it off?


697
00:27:18.285 --> 00:27:19.986
All right.
It was an accident.


698
00:27:19.987 --> 00:27:21.020
Ow! My nose! Ow!

699
00:27:21.021 --> 00:27:22.055
I'm sorry.

700
00:27:22.056 --> 00:27:23.222
Dale: Hello?

701
00:27:23.223 --> 00:27:26.326
Have you seen
a young man named Scott?


702
00:27:26.327 --> 00:27:28.563
He's my son!

703
00:27:29.497 --> 00:27:32.533
Perfect. Have you
seen this boy?


704
00:27:40.307 --> 00:27:42.008
You guys want him?

705
00:27:42.009 --> 00:27:43.309
Oh, no!

706
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.013
Aah!

707
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.527
Oh, Jack! Oh, Jack.

708
00:28:00.528 --> 00:28:02.029
All right, stop it.

709
00:28:22.016 --> 00:28:23.983
That's him!

710
00:28:23.984 --> 00:28:25.420
That's Scott!

711
00:28:28.088 --> 00:28:29.989
My boy!

712
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.492
Get the gate!

713
00:28:36.363 --> 00:28:37.664
Turn around, guys.

714
00:28:37.665 --> 00:28:39.365
Oh, no, excuse me,
Mr Humongous,


715
00:28:39.366 --> 00:28:40.700
but we've got to
get back to that boy.


716
00:28:40.701 --> 00:28:42.436
Turn around!
Private area!


717
00:28:42.437 --> 00:28:44.471
Hey, listen, let's make
it a semi-private area.


718
00:28:44.472 --> 00:28:45.739
I really have
to get back there.


719
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.974
Don't make me have
to hurt you, old man.


720
00:28:47.975 --> 00:28:49.308
Old man.
Old man?


721
00:28:49.309 --> 00:28:50.577
Old man.

722
00:28:50.578 --> 00:28:52.311
Come here, let me
tell you something.


723
00:28:52.312 --> 00:28:53.814
What's that?

724
00:28:57.184 --> 00:28:59.118
Let's go.
What?


725
00:28:59.119 --> 00:29:01.422
Let's go.
Come on.


726
00:29:04.358 --> 00:29:06.993
Oh, my God!

727
00:29:06.994 --> 00:29:08.394
Ohh!

728
00:29:08.395 --> 00:29:10.029
Oh, Scotty.

729
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.431
Everything's
all right.


730
00:29:11.432 --> 00:29:13.467
I'm here. It's ok.
It's ok.


731
00:29:13.468 --> 00:29:15.301
It's not him.

732
00:29:15.302 --> 00:29:16.603
Who's this?

733
00:29:16.604 --> 00:29:19.006
I don't know.

734
00:29:20.074 --> 00:29:22.108
He's over here!

735
00:29:22.109 --> 00:29:23.342
Call your father.

736
00:29:23.343 --> 00:29:24.377
Come on!

737
00:29:24.378 --> 00:29:26.112
Ok.

738
00:29:26.113 --> 00:29:27.380
Is he all right?

739
00:29:27.381 --> 00:29:29.382
We better get him up.
He's out cold.


740
00:29:29.383 --> 00:29:32.552
Ohh! Oh, this guy's
in good shape.


741
00:29:32.553 --> 00:29:34.854
Oh, that girl's
not for you.


742
00:29:34.855 --> 00:29:37.157
Yeah, she's for
everybody else.


743
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:46.099
At least we know he ate.

744
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.133
Ok.

745
00:29:47.134 --> 00:29:48.401
Yeah.
Get him out of here.


746
00:29:48.402 --> 00:29:50.037
He's going to
catch pneumonia.


747
00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:52.672
Jack: No, no,
he's ok, Collette.


748
00:29:52.673 --> 00:29:54.340
No, I-
-I promise.

749
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:58.444
No, I'll--I'll, uh, I'll
tell you all about it
when I see you,


750
00:29:58.445 --> 00:30:00.246
but, uh, what
we're gonna do is,


751
00:30:00.247 --> 00:30:04.551
we're gonna bring him
back to the hotel in
San Francisco tonight,


752
00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:08.387
and then we'll
bring him home tomorrow.


753
00:30:08.388 --> 00:30:10.757
And then, Collette,
listen to me,


754
00:30:10.758 --> 00:30:14.393
we have got to
work this thing out.


755
00:30:14.394 --> 00:30:17.163
Ok. You're welcome.

756
00:30:17.164 --> 00:30:19.533
I'll tell him. Bye.

757
00:30:19.534 --> 00:30:21.434
She was happy, huh?

758
00:30:21.435 --> 00:30:24.672
Oh, yeah, she was
happy and relieved.


759
00:30:28.042 --> 00:30:29.175
You know, it's funny.

760
00:30:29.176 --> 00:30:31.377
The first time I got drunk,
it was over a girl.


761
00:30:31.378 --> 00:30:32.812
Yeah.
Yeah?


762
00:30:32.813 --> 00:30:36.015
My first suicide attempt
was over a girl.


763
00:30:36.016 --> 00:30:37.851
Are you joking?
You--you really--


764
00:30:37.852 --> 00:30:40.920
No. I--I used to
be somewhat unstable.


765
00:30:40.921 --> 00:30:42.723
Oh.

766
00:30:44.424 --> 00:30:45.559
What happened?

767
00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.426
Well, it was
in high school.


768
00:30:47.427 --> 00:30:49.596
We were
doing a production
of The King and I.


769
00:30:49.597 --> 00:30:50.697
Mm-hmm.

770
00:30:50.698 --> 00:30:53.733
And my drama teacher,
Miss Manero,


771
00:30:53.734 --> 00:30:55.935
stayed late one night
to show me that dance


772
00:30:55.936 --> 00:30:57.503
that the king
does with Anna.


773
00:30:57.504 --> 00:30:59.205
Oh, uh...

774
00:30:59.206 --> 00:31:01.040
* Shall we dance? *
* Shall we dance? *


775
00:31:01.041 --> 00:31:02.509
* Ba ba ba *
* Ba ba ba *


776
00:31:04.444 --> 00:31:05.511
* Shall we dance? *

777
00:31:05.512 --> 00:31:07.847
1, 2, 3.

778
00:31:07.848 --> 00:31:10.550
Well, she taught me
the dance,


779
00:31:10.551 --> 00:31:12.552
and then she
showed me a part


780
00:31:12.553 --> 00:31:14.188
that was obviously cut
from the original.


781
00:31:18.726 --> 00:31:22.028
You made it with
your high school teacher?


782
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:23.429
Yeah.

783
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.364
You know,
I got to tell you.


784
00:31:25.365 --> 00:31:28.034
I don't know what you have
to be depressed about.


785
00:31:28.035 --> 00:31:30.036
You're taking nude
pictures of roommates,


786
00:31:30.037 --> 00:31:32.071
you're humping
your faculty.


787
00:31:32.072 --> 00:31:35.041
Your life is something
I'd be ashamed to rent.


788
00:31:35.042 --> 00:31:38.077
But she dumped me.

789
00:31:38.078 --> 00:31:39.813
Oh, yeah?

790
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:43.083
Oh, hey, look,
these things happen.


791
00:31:45.052 --> 00:31:46.519
Is there--

792
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.421
There's nobody there.

793
00:31:48.422 --> 00:31:50.157
Thank you.

794
00:31:53.293 --> 00:31:55.228
Why don't you take
a plane in the morning?


795
00:31:55.229 --> 00:31:57.063
No, that'd be too late.

796
00:31:57.064 --> 00:31:59.332
It's--I'm his father.
I want to be there when
he wakes up.


797
00:31:59.333 --> 00:32:02.670
If, you know, if I
drive straight through,
I can just make it.


798
00:32:05.572 --> 00:32:07.707
You're still angry
at me, aren't you?


799
00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:10.109
Actually, I'm--I'm
just angry at myself.


800
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:13.412
I should have been
the one to go after him
in the first place.


801
00:32:13.413 --> 00:32:17.516
No, I just--I wanted
to give him a chance to
come home on his own,


802
00:32:17.517 --> 00:32:19.687
and he didn't.

803
00:32:22.156 --> 00:32:25.059
I love him and
I want him to know it.


804
00:32:27.728 --> 00:32:30.931
Ok, I should go.

805
00:32:34.401 --> 00:32:35.935
For the road.

806
00:32:35.936 --> 00:32:36.971
Thanks.

807
00:32:38.005 --> 00:32:40.339
Bob, when you see--when
you see Jack and Dale,


808
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.343
tell them how sorry
and ashamed I am
about what I did.


809
00:32:44.344 --> 00:32:48.147
I just didn't think
I'd see Scotty again.


810
00:32:48.148 --> 00:32:50.685
I'm sorry you
couldn't count on me.


811
00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:10.369
Good evening,
Mr Lawrence.


812
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.439
How are you, Andre?
Nice to see you again.


813
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.507
Fine.

814
00:33:14.508 --> 00:33:16.509
I got him.
It's ok. I got him.


815
00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.544
Oh, wait, wait.
Can we...


816
00:33:18.545 --> 00:33:19.679
May I help you?

817
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.114
We got him.
No, we're fine.


818
00:33:21.115 --> 00:33:22.148
You're sure?

819
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.983
Absolutely.

820
00:33:22.984 --> 00:33:24.952
Little man
had a big day. Ok.


821
00:33:27.554 --> 00:33:29.122
Good evening,
Charles.


822
00:33:29.123 --> 00:33:31.491
Anything we can
help you with,
Mr Lawrence?


823
00:33:33.193 --> 00:33:35.394
Could you send
the valet to my room,
please?


824
00:33:35.395 --> 00:33:36.662
Right away,
sir.


825
00:33:36.663 --> 00:33:37.898
Thank you.

826
00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:40.633
Here we go.

827
00:33:40.634 --> 00:33:42.936
Good evening.
Oh, after you.


828
00:33:42.937 --> 00:33:44.704
We'll take
the next one.


829
00:33:44.705 --> 00:33:46.173
Ok.

830
00:33:48.142 --> 00:33:50.877
Ohh!
Ohh!


831
00:33:50.878 --> 00:33:52.545
Dale:
Oh, he's a mess.


832
00:33:52.546 --> 00:33:53.914
Yeah.

833
00:34:02.089 --> 00:34:04.457
Oh, my God!

834
00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:05.691
What, fungus?

835
00:34:05.692 --> 00:34:08.428
Look at his toes.
Look at his toes.


836
00:34:15.569 --> 00:34:17.403
What am I missing?

837
00:34:17.404 --> 00:34:20.006
Do you see how that
big one bends that way,


838
00:34:20.007 --> 00:34:22.041
the little one
tucks itself underneath?


839
00:34:22.042 --> 00:34:24.310
Uh-huh. You're
easily entertained.


840
00:34:24.311 --> 00:34:27.181
Mm-hmm.
Oh, really?
Entertain this.


841
00:34:32.152 --> 00:34:33.286
Huh?

842
00:34:33.287 --> 00:34:34.320
What?

843
00:34:34.321 --> 00:34:35.855
See, it's a match.

844
00:34:35.856 --> 00:34:38.257
We have the same toes.

845
00:34:38.258 --> 00:34:40.459
Millions of people
have toes like that.


846
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.195
Yeah.
Oh, really?


847
00:34:42.196 --> 00:34:43.462
Do you?

848
00:34:43.463 --> 00:34:44.497
Yeah.

849
00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:45.598
Oh, let's see.

850
00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:46.632
No.

851
00:34:46.633 --> 00:34:48.134
Take your shoes
and socks off.


852
00:34:48.135 --> 00:34:49.168
No, I won't.

853
00:34:49.169 --> 00:34:50.536
Get away.
Come on,
take them off.


854
00:34:50.537 --> 00:34:51.637
Come on, let's see.

855
00:34:51.638 --> 00:34:53.106
Let's see what
you've got there.


856
00:34:53.107 --> 00:34:54.673
Come on, come on,
take them off.


857
00:34:54.674 --> 00:34:55.708
No! Ow!
Let go!


858
00:34:55.709 --> 00:34:56.742
Let me see.

859
00:34:56.743 --> 00:34:57.777
I will sue you!

860
00:34:57.778 --> 00:34:58.812
Yeah?

861
00:34:58.813 --> 00:35:00.847
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Uncle! Uncle!


862
00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:02.448
Ha ha ha ha ha.

863
00:35:02.449 --> 00:35:03.482
All right!

864
00:35:03.483 --> 00:35:04.918
What?

865
00:35:04.919 --> 00:35:09.388
Oh. Oh, I'm really sorry,
Dale. You don't match.


866
00:35:09.389 --> 00:35:12.927
No match. You lose.
I'm the father. Ha ha.


867
00:35:17.932 --> 00:35:19.800
Means nothing.

868
00:35:20.935 --> 00:35:22.870
That's not proof.

869
00:35:28.475 --> 00:35:30.310
Oh, toe-boy.

870
00:35:32.479 --> 00:35:34.513
Check this out.

871
00:35:34.514 --> 00:35:36.549
What?

872
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.584
The whirl.

873
00:35:38.585 --> 00:35:40.955
The whirl?

874
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:44.357
The boy has a whirl,

875
00:35:44.358 --> 00:35:46.359
just like I got one.

876
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.793
See, that's a whirl.

877
00:35:47.794 --> 00:35:50.096
This is a curl,
that's whirl.


878
00:35:50.097 --> 00:35:53.532
Do you have a whirl?

879
00:35:53.533 --> 00:35:55.501
No.

880
00:35:55.502 --> 00:35:57.036
No whirl.

881
00:35:57.037 --> 00:35:59.638
You... are whirless!

882
00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:00.940
Ha ha!

883
00:36:00.941 --> 00:36:03.276
Thank you very much.

884
00:36:03.277 --> 00:36:05.411
I go to a hairdresser,
I get a whirl.


885
00:36:05.412 --> 00:36:07.646
Really? Well, I will
tell Jose maybe


886
00:36:07.647 --> 00:36:10.816
to add some
more hair, ok?


887
00:36:10.817 --> 00:36:14.253
Let me ask you
something, Whirly.


888
00:36:14.254 --> 00:36:16.022
Ok, nothing
about sports.


889
00:36:16.023 --> 00:36:19.325
Ok, when did--when did
Collette call you?


890
00:36:19.326 --> 00:36:20.326
Uh...

891
00:36:20.327 --> 00:36:22.728
Huh? When did she
talk to you about him?


892
00:36:22.729 --> 00:36:23.762
Tuesday.

893
00:36:23.763 --> 00:36:25.331
Oh, too bad.

894
00:36:25.332 --> 00:36:27.333
That's it,
I'm the father. You lose.


895
00:36:27.334 --> 00:36:29.602
But you go home with
some lovely parting gifts.


896
00:36:29.603 --> 00:36:30.970
You get all that
from Tuesday?


897
00:36:30.971 --> 00:36:32.771
How?
Yes.


898
00:36:32.772 --> 00:36:35.108
Because she
saw me on Monday.


899
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.943
So?

900
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:37.710
So I wasn't
very co-operative,


901
00:36:37.711 --> 00:36:40.880
so then she came to you.

902
00:36:40.881 --> 00:36:46.453
I cannot believe
you did that with
an unconscious child.


903
00:36:50.657 --> 00:36:51.857
Get the phone.
Get the phone.


904
00:36:51.858 --> 00:36:53.559
Ow! Ohh!

905
00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.593
Excuse me.

906
00:36:54.594 --> 00:36:55.794
Hello?

907
00:36:55.795 --> 00:36:57.563
Jack! Oh, finally.

908
00:36:57.564 --> 00:36:58.797
Where have you been?

909
00:36:58.798 --> 00:37:00.466
Uh, I was out.

910
00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:02.268
Of course you were out.
I've been calling you
all night, Jack.


911
00:37:02.269 --> 00:37:04.370
I mean, I was afraid
that you had been
killed or something.


912
00:37:04.371 --> 00:37:06.372
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm absolutely fine.


913
00:37:06.373 --> 00:37:08.274
I just had, uh,
something I had to do.


914
00:37:08.275 --> 00:37:10.076
Carrie:
Where have you been?
Jack, soap!


915
00:37:10.077 --> 00:37:11.310
Dale:
Some soap,
please.


916
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:12.378
Who is that?

917
00:37:12.379 --> 00:37:13.213
No one.

918
00:37:13.214 --> 00:37:14.447
What do you mean
no one?


919
00:37:14.448 --> 00:37:16.649
Well, actually, honey,
it's--it's a friend.


920
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.517
I made a new friend.

921
00:37:18.518 --> 00:37:19.386
Hello?
Valet.


922
00:37:19.387 --> 00:37:20.987
Dale: I'm hosing
him down, Jack.


923
00:37:20.988 --> 00:37:23.990
What--what
is that noise?


924
00:37:23.991 --> 00:37:25.258
That's the shower.

925
00:37:25.259 --> 00:37:27.193
You and your new friend
are taking a shower?


926
00:37:27.194 --> 00:37:29.028
No, we're not--
I'm not in the shower.


927
00:37:29.029 --> 00:37:31.330
Uh, he's in the shower.

928
00:37:31.331 --> 00:37:32.631
And you're
watching him?


929
00:37:32.632 --> 00:37:34.267
Somebody call
for a valet?


930
00:37:34.268 --> 00:37:35.534
No--
It's like
wrestling flipper!


931
00:37:35.535 --> 00:37:36.802
Excuse me,
I knocked,


932
00:37:36.803 --> 00:37:38.972
but I guess you
didn't hear me.


933
00:37:38.973 --> 00:37:40.539
Oh, he's so slippery.

934
00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.508
I'll come back.

935
00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:43.142
No, no, no, no, no.
Just--just--just--


936
00:37:43.143 --> 00:37:45.111
The jacket is on the desk,
and I'll give you the pants.


937
00:37:45.112 --> 00:37:46.980
Honey, hold on. I got
to take my pants off.


938
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:48.181
Don't call me honey.

939
00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:49.915
No, not you. Honey,
hold on just a sec.


940
00:37:49.916 --> 00:37:51.384
No, I'm not
going to hold on.


941
00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:52.451
Oh, no!

942
00:37:52.452 --> 00:37:53.287
Oh, no!

943
00:37:53.288 --> 00:37:55.488
Carrie: You pick
up this phone!


944
00:37:55.489 --> 00:37:56.622
Pick up the phone!

945
00:37:56.623 --> 00:37:58.357
Pick up the phone,
Jack!


946
00:37:58.358 --> 00:38:01.560
How's everything
at the house? All right?


947
00:38:01.561 --> 00:38:03.429
Oh, Jack!

948
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.863
He's gonna blow!

949
00:38:04.864 --> 00:38:06.466
What is go--

950
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:08.667
What was that noise?

951
00:38:08.668 --> 00:38:11.504
Carrie, you
are confusing me.
I'm very tired.


952
00:38:11.505 --> 00:38:13.306
Explain to me
what is going on there.


953
00:38:13.307 --> 00:38:16.275
Honey, listen,
it's--it's very
complicated, ok?


954
00:38:16.276 --> 00:38:20.179
He's soaking wet!
Get over here!
Dry his toes!


955
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.215
Honey, I have to go.

956
00:38:22.216 --> 00:38:24.584
I have to help him
towel off the boy.


957
00:38:26.086 --> 00:38:27.586
What boy?

958
00:38:27.587 --> 00:38:29.588
Bye.

959
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:30.990
That went well.

960
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:32.492
Ohh!

961
00:38:34.028 --> 00:38:35.394
There you go.

962
00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:37.130
Did you have to
talk all the time?


963
00:38:37.131 --> 00:38:39.298
Oh, excuse me, but
I was in there all alone!


964
00:38:39.299 --> 00:38:41.300
Why couldn't you
respect my privacy?


965
00:38:41.301 --> 00:38:44.504
I'm trying
to clean up our boy.


966
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:50.076
He's weeping.
Now he's weeping.


967
00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:51.344
This is great.

968
00:38:51.345 --> 00:38:53.379
Why'd we bother putting
him in the shower?


969
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.482
You just could
have wept on him.


970
00:39:00.654 --> 00:39:02.189
Bob: Ok.

971
00:39:06.593 --> 00:39:08.594
Ohh!

972
00:39:08.595 --> 00:39:10.497
Oh.

973
00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:15.102
God!

974
00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.057
15 minutes till I
take this deposition.


975
00:39:38.058 --> 00:39:39.925
Where the hell is he
with my suit?


976
00:39:39.926 --> 00:39:41.394
Jack, look at this.

977
00:39:41.395 --> 00:39:43.929
That's money. I remember
that from when I was single.


978
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.531
It's $5,000.

979
00:39:45.532 --> 00:39:47.800
I was cleaning out
his pants and I found
it in the pockets.


980
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:51.036
$5,000 in cash.
What's he doing with
$5,000 in cash?


981
00:39:51.037 --> 00:39:52.538
He stole it.

982
00:39:52.539 --> 00:39:54.440
Why do you
leap to the worst
possible conclusion?


983
00:39:54.441 --> 00:39:57.511
Ok, he won it
in a hair whirl
contest.


984
00:39:58.545 --> 00:40:00.679
That's my suit.

985
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.215
Here's your suit.

986
00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:04.717
Thank you. Oh, wait,
wait, wait. Here.
Thank you.


987
00:40:04.718 --> 00:40:05.884
Thank you.

988
00:40:05.885 --> 00:40:08.587
Hey, I didn't
see a thing.


989
00:40:08.588 --> 00:40:09.622
Get out of here.

990
00:40:09.623 --> 00:40:12.658
Jack, you took $20
of the boy's money.


991
00:40:12.659 --> 00:40:13.859
Just 20.

992
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.262
I'm going to
keep track of that.
You owe him $20.


993
00:40:16.263 --> 00:40:19.498
Jack owes 20.

994
00:40:19.499 --> 00:40:20.533
Dale?

995
00:40:20.534 --> 00:40:21.900
What?

996
00:40:21.901 --> 00:40:23.503
He's getting up.

997
00:40:42.322 --> 00:40:44.191
Good morning.
Good morning.


998
00:40:45.259 --> 00:40:47.593
Who are you?

999
00:40:47.594 --> 00:40:49.595
I'm Dale Putley.

1000
00:40:49.596 --> 00:40:51.764
I'm Jack Lawrence.

1001
00:40:51.765 --> 00:40:52.865
We're--

1002
00:40:52.866 --> 00:40:53.932
Friends.

1003
00:40:53.933 --> 00:40:55.735
Right. Of your mother.

1004
00:40:56.936 --> 00:40:57.970
Wh-where am I?

1005
00:40:57.971 --> 00:40:59.004
San Francisco.

1006
00:40:59.005 --> 00:41:00.072
The Mark Hopkins Hotel.

1007
00:41:00.073 --> 00:41:01.140
Beautiful day
out there.


1008
00:41:01.141 --> 00:41:02.575
You had a big night
last night.


1009
00:41:02.576 --> 00:41:05.544
Oh, boy.
You were...
Ha ha ha.


1010
00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:06.579
Where's Nikki?

1011
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.713
Oh, Sacramento.

1012
00:41:07.714 --> 00:41:10.115
Forget her.
I wouldn't
worry about her.


1013
00:41:10.116 --> 00:41:14.019
What'd you do with my cl--
my clothes?


1014
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.554
Well, you--you
were very sick and--


1015
00:41:15.555 --> 00:41:17.190
Listen,
don't be scared.


1016
00:41:17.191 --> 00:41:20.393
Look, I just want
my clothes, and I want
to get out of here.


1017
00:41:20.394 --> 00:41:22.428
You can't keep me here.
It's illegal.


1018
00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:25.398
Now, take
it easy, ok?


1019
00:41:25.399 --> 00:41:27.032
We got to tell him.

1020
00:41:27.033 --> 00:41:28.534
I guess so.

1021
00:41:28.535 --> 00:41:29.868
What?

1022
00:41:29.869 --> 00:41:31.003
What?

1023
00:41:31.004 --> 00:41:32.037
Scott, sit down.

1024
00:41:32.038 --> 00:41:33.071
Please?

1025
00:41:33.072 --> 00:41:34.373
Come on.

1026
00:41:34.374 --> 00:41:36.675
Dale:
We've got a little
surprise for you.


1027
00:41:36.676 --> 00:41:37.844
Come on.

1028
00:41:39.078 --> 00:41:40.547
Have a seat.

1029
00:41:43.383 --> 00:41:45.584
Do you mind
if I tell him?


1030
00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:47.520
Fine.

1031
00:41:47.521 --> 00:41:48.388
Scott--

1032
00:41:48.389 --> 00:41:51.490
17 years ago,
your mother and I


1033
00:41:51.491 --> 00:41:54.293
were pedalling through
the wine country.


1034
00:41:54.294 --> 00:41:56.295
It began to rain.
It was more of a mist.


1035
00:41:56.296 --> 00:41:58.864
It was
so romantic.


1036
00:41:58.865 --> 00:42:02.535
I don't have time
for the wine country saga
right now, ok?


1037
00:42:02.536 --> 00:42:03.670
Fine.

1038
00:42:07.207 --> 00:42:08.407
Scott...

1039
00:42:08.408 --> 00:42:10.976
What I'm
about to tell you


1040
00:42:10.977 --> 00:42:12.645
may sound
a little bit--


1041
00:42:12.646 --> 00:42:14.613
Bizarre.

1042
00:42:14.614 --> 00:42:16.315
Unusual.

1043
00:42:16.316 --> 00:42:17.916
Unbelievable,
actually.


1044
00:42:17.917 --> 00:42:19.184
Mm-hmm.

1045
00:42:19.185 --> 00:42:24.223
Uh, this is the truth,
as best as we know it.


1046
00:42:24.224 --> 00:42:25.658
One of us--

1047
00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:26.493
Either one.

1048
00:42:26.494 --> 00:42:29.696
Either one.
Whatever. Sorry.


1049
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:35.235
Scott, one of us
might be...


1050
00:42:37.003 --> 00:42:38.705
your father.

1051
00:42:40.474 --> 00:42:42.908
I know. It
sounds crazy
to us, too,


1052
00:42:42.909 --> 00:42:44.310
but, you see--

1053
00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:47.946
17 years ago,
we--we both...


1054
00:42:47.947 --> 00:42:49.348
Your mother.

1055
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:51.717
And there's
a debate now
as to who your--


1056
00:42:51.718 --> 00:42:53.085
Father is.

1057
00:42:53.086 --> 00:42:54.119
Yeah,
it's the truth.


1058
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.153
This is bullshit!

1059
00:42:55.154 --> 00:42:56.455
No, no,
it's true.


1060
00:42:56.456 --> 00:42:58.425
You can
call your mother.
She'll tell you.


1061
00:42:59.659 --> 00:43:01.261
Oh...

1062
00:43:02.762 --> 00:43:03.897
Hello?

1063
00:43:09.303 --> 00:43:10.703
Your car's here.

1064
00:43:10.704 --> 00:43:12.705
Yeah. Listen,
I have to go.


1065
00:43:12.706 --> 00:43:13.872
Now?

1066
00:43:13.873 --> 00:43:16.108
Yeah.
I have a deposition
in 15 minutes.


1067
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:17.310
What the hell
are we gonna do?


1068
00:43:17.311 --> 00:43:18.344
About what?

1069
00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:19.378
Yeah.
About what?


1070
00:43:19.379 --> 00:43:20.679
About the fact

1071
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.648
that I'm leaving
him alone with you.


1072
00:43:22.649 --> 00:43:24.417
Oh, why don't you do
the old headbutt?


1073
00:43:24.418 --> 00:43:26.184
That way he'll
be sprawled out
on the floor


1074
00:43:26.185 --> 00:43:27.853
when you come back.

1075
00:43:27.854 --> 00:43:29.688
All I'm saying is, are
you gonna be ok with him
if I leave you?


1076
00:43:29.689 --> 00:43:31.890
Well, I'm a lot more
capable than you
think I am.


1077
00:43:31.891 --> 00:43:32.726
Where's my money?

1078
00:43:32.727 --> 00:43:33.959
Yeah, don't worry--
I got it.


1079
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.894
Give me my money.

1080
00:43:34.895 --> 00:43:36.729
That's my money!
I want it right now!


1081
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.230
Back off, skippy, or
I'll call the cops!


1082
00:43:38.231 --> 00:43:42.100
Hey! Let's just
take it easy, ok?


1083
00:43:42.101 --> 00:43:43.135
I'm sorry.

1084
00:43:43.136 --> 00:43:44.269
Calm down.

1085
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:45.572
All right?

1086
00:43:46.806 --> 00:43:47.973
What?
Come here.


1087
00:43:47.974 --> 00:43:49.174
Give me the money.
No.


1088
00:43:49.175 --> 00:43:50.543
Give me the money.

1089
00:43:50.544 --> 00:43:52.745
As a parent,
I disagree with
your approach.


1090
00:43:52.746 --> 00:43:53.779
Thank you.

1091
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.113
Here's the money.

1092
00:43:55.114 --> 00:43:59.586
No, we're just going
to put it right here
for safekeeping.


1093
00:44:01.087 --> 00:44:02.488
Ok?

1094
00:44:02.489 --> 00:44:05.057
You'll see.
I have got to go out.


1095
00:44:05.058 --> 00:44:08.361
And when I
come back, we'll--
we'll talk about this.


1096
00:44:08.362 --> 00:44:09.795
We'll all get
to know each other,


1097
00:44:09.796 --> 00:44:11.497
and you'll see,
it won't be so bad, ok?


1098
00:44:11.498 --> 00:44:13.098
Order anything you want
from room service.


1099
00:44:13.099 --> 00:44:14.500
It's on me.

1100
00:44:14.501 --> 00:44:16.234
Whoa! That's a biggie!

1101
00:44:16.235 --> 00:44:17.837
Hey, Jack...

1102
00:44:20.106 --> 00:44:21.508
Oh, boy.

1103
00:44:24.644 --> 00:44:26.445
Morning.

1104
00:44:26.446 --> 00:44:29.281
Beautiful day,
ain't it?


1105
00:44:29.282 --> 00:44:31.651
Oh, yeah,
perfect so far.


1106
00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:38.391
My guy's out with
the truck right now.


1107
00:44:38.392 --> 00:44:40.426
Soon as he gets back,
we'll get your car.


1108
00:44:40.427 --> 00:44:44.062
Ok, great.
I gotta call my wife.


1109
00:44:44.063 --> 00:44:45.598
Any men's room?

1110
00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:48.200
We use a port-a-potty.
It's out back.


1111
00:44:48.201 --> 00:44:49.435
* Ain't it something *

1112
00:44:49.436 --> 00:44:52.070
* How the way things go? *

1113
00:44:52.071 --> 00:44:54.072
* Ain't it something *

1114
00:44:54.073 --> 00:44:56.241
* Ain't it something *

1115
00:44:56.242 --> 00:44:58.010
* Ain't it something *

1116
00:44:58.011 --> 00:44:59.978
* The way things go? *

1117
00:44:59.979 --> 00:45:01.447
Everything ok?

1118
00:45:01.448 --> 00:45:03.049
Oh, yeah.

1119
00:45:04.484 --> 00:45:06.118
* Ain't it something *

1120
00:45:06.119 --> 00:45:08.554
* How the way things go? *

1121
00:45:08.555 --> 00:45:10.288
* Ain't it something *

1122
00:45:10.289 --> 00:45:13.427
* How the way things go? *

1123
00:45:16.663 --> 00:45:18.230
Hey!

1124
00:45:18.231 --> 00:45:20.132
Whoa! Aah!

1125
00:45:20.133 --> 00:45:21.266
Ohh!

1126
00:45:21.267 --> 00:45:22.735
Ow!

1127
00:45:22.736 --> 00:45:24.002
Ohh!

1128
00:45:24.003 --> 00:45:25.370
Help!

1129
00:45:25.371 --> 00:45:26.839
Oh, my God!

1130
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.240
Help!

1131
00:45:28.241 --> 00:45:31.276
Whoa! This is not good.

1132
00:45:31.277 --> 00:45:32.611
Are you ok?

1133
00:45:32.612 --> 00:45:34.447
No, it's horrible!

1134
00:45:34.448 --> 00:45:36.181
It's an accident,
I swear.


1135
00:45:36.182 --> 00:45:37.249
I don't care!

1136
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:38.718
I'll get help.

1137
00:45:41.387 --> 00:45:43.255
And then I wrote
my medical musical comedy.


1138
00:45:43.256 --> 00:45:44.657
It was called:

1139
00:45:44.658 --> 00:45:48.427
Hello, Doctor,
It's Still Swollen.


1140
00:45:48.428 --> 00:45:49.628
Catchy, huh?

1141
00:45:49.629 --> 00:45:52.397
It had a great
opening number.


1142
00:45:52.398 --> 00:45:53.866
Oh, uh, it was
called Hindsight.


1143
00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:55.167
And, my--

1144
00:45:55.168 --> 00:45:56.769
you know, the audience
was all out there
and we went...


1145
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:58.904
* Hello, Mr Colon *

1146
00:45:58.905 --> 00:46:00.506
* My prostate's
feelin' swollen *


1147
00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:02.441
* I think that
thing's are flowin' *


1148
00:46:02.442 --> 00:46:03.477
* Not so well *

1149
00:46:05.144 --> 00:46:06.445
Breakfast. Ha ha.

1150
00:46:06.446 --> 00:46:07.913
* I'm feelin'
kind of heinous *


1151
00:46:07.914 --> 00:46:09.147
* 'Cause there's
something in my-- *


1152
00:46:09.148 --> 00:46:10.182
Good morning.

1153
00:46:10.183 --> 00:46:11.416
Come on in.

1154
00:46:11.417 --> 00:46:12.551
Here's your breakfast.

1155
00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:14.419
Oh, yes, indeed.

1156
00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.054
Mmm! Yum! Yum!

1157
00:46:16.055 --> 00:46:17.422
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1158
00:46:17.423 --> 00:46:18.824
Here we go.

1159
00:46:18.825 --> 00:46:20.125
Let's see
what we have here.


1160
00:46:20.126 --> 00:46:22.628
Belgian waffles,
all the way from Brussels.


1161
00:46:22.629 --> 00:46:25.198
Granola, nature's broom.

1162
00:46:27.366 --> 00:46:29.835
15%, but I'm not paying,

1163
00:46:29.836 --> 00:46:32.304
so $20 tip.

1164
00:46:32.305 --> 00:46:33.405
Waiter:
Very good, sir.


1165
00:46:33.406 --> 00:46:34.840
Thank you.

1166
00:46:34.841 --> 00:46:36.374
Enjoy.

1167
00:46:36.375 --> 00:46:38.410
Oh, look, come on.

1168
00:46:38.411 --> 00:46:39.712
I saw that.
Mr Dimples.


1169
00:46:39.713 --> 00:46:42.047
He's trying to
make an appearance.


1170
00:46:42.048 --> 00:46:43.649
Come on.

1171
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.884
* Gray skies
are gonna clear up *


1172
00:46:45.885 --> 00:46:48.420
* Sit on a happy face *

1173
00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:50.856
That's the way
my mother used to sing it.


1174
00:46:50.857 --> 00:46:54.392
But that's another story
and a lot of therapy.


1175
00:46:54.393 --> 00:46:56.228
Ooh.

1176
00:46:56.229 --> 00:46:58.497
Actually,
I am pretty hungry.


1177
00:46:58.498 --> 00:47:01.500
Thanks for
ordering breakfast.


1178
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:03.636
You're welcome. Hey...

1179
00:47:03.637 --> 00:47:06.706
You probably need it
after last night.


1180
00:47:09.342 --> 00:47:11.409
You want some coffee?

1181
00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.479
Thank you.

1182
00:47:14.347 --> 00:47:16.481
Aren't you
a little gentleman.


1183
00:47:16.482 --> 00:47:18.183
Aah!

1184
00:47:18.184 --> 00:47:19.217
Aah!

1185
00:47:19.218 --> 00:47:20.252
Ow!

1186
00:47:20.253 --> 00:47:21.654
Ow! Ohh!

1187
00:47:21.655 --> 00:47:23.822
Oh, God! Ohh!

1188
00:47:23.823 --> 00:47:26.525
You little shit!
May you rot in hell!


1189
00:47:26.526 --> 00:47:28.728
Oh, my testicles!

1190
00:47:30.029 --> 00:47:31.463
Ohh! Ohh!

1191
00:47:31.464 --> 00:47:33.031
Ohh. Ohh.

1192
00:47:33.032 --> 00:47:34.066
Ah, Woolite!

1193
00:47:34.067 --> 00:47:37.671
Ow! Ow!

1194
00:47:49.415 --> 00:47:51.117
Good morning.

1195
00:47:55.221 --> 00:47:56.321
Aah!

1196
00:47:56.322 --> 00:47:58.056
Oh! Oh, sorry.

1197
00:47:58.057 --> 00:47:59.626
It's all right.

1198
00:48:02.395 --> 00:48:04.429
I'll stand, you go.

1199
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:05.798
Fine.

1200
00:48:05.799 --> 00:48:07.166
Ok.

1201
00:48:10.136 --> 00:48:12.005
Oh, excuse me.

1202
00:48:13.439 --> 00:48:15.575
Good afternoon.

1203
00:48:28.154 --> 00:48:29.823
Jack?

1204
00:48:35.328 --> 00:48:37.395
Jack?

1205
00:48:37.396 --> 00:48:38.430
Jack--

1206
00:48:38.431 --> 00:48:39.564
Uh, excuse me. Hi.

1207
00:48:39.565 --> 00:48:40.833
Yes, good morning.
How are you?


1208
00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:42.534
Good morning. I'm fine.

1209
00:48:42.535 --> 00:48:44.737
Do you know anything
about the man who was
staying in this room?


1210
00:48:44.738 --> 00:48:46.872
I was paid to keep
my mouth shut, lady.


1211
00:48:46.873 --> 00:48:48.907
No, no, no, no,
look, I'm his wife.


1212
00:48:48.908 --> 00:48:51.343
Lady, I don't want to get
in the middle of it, ok?


1213
00:48:51.344 --> 00:48:53.578
What?
The middle of what?


1214
00:48:53.579 --> 00:48:56.382
If it's any comfort,
I've seen worse.


1215
00:48:59.552 --> 00:49:00.686
Bob: Help!

1216
00:49:00.687 --> 00:49:02.688
All right, hold on.
I'm coming, pal.


1217
00:49:02.689 --> 00:49:03.789
Bob: Ok.

1218
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.824
Oh, man, does that stink!

1219
00:49:05.825 --> 00:49:07.860
Just get me out.
It's terrible in here.


1220
00:49:07.861 --> 00:49:09.895
Hey, you know,
it'd been a lot easier


1221
00:49:09.896 --> 00:49:11.630
if you'd landed
with the door on top.


1222
00:49:11.631 --> 00:49:13.165
Next time.
Ohh. Ohh.


1223
00:49:13.166 --> 00:49:15.934
Hey, don't worry about it.
We got a winch right here.


1224
00:49:15.935 --> 00:49:18.236
We're gonna lift the whole
thing just right up.


1225
00:49:18.237 --> 00:49:21.106
Just hurry. I'm trying
to help my son.


1226
00:49:21.107 --> 00:49:23.108
Oh, my God!
Is he in there, too?


1227
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:25.477
Bring 'em up!
Nice and easy!


1228
00:49:25.478 --> 00:49:27.113
You're looking real good.

1229
00:49:28.614 --> 00:49:30.215
You all right in there?

1230
00:49:30.216 --> 00:49:33.151
We'll get--whoa!
Ok.


1231
00:49:33.152 --> 00:49:34.552
Bob: Aah! Ohh!

1232
00:49:34.553 --> 00:49:36.722
Ow!

1233
00:49:36.723 --> 00:49:38.256
Oh, God!

1234
00:49:38.257 --> 00:49:39.092
Ooh!

1235
00:49:39.659 --> 00:49:45.230
Mr. Barmore, when you invested
your client's money in this --


1236
00:49:45.231 --> 00:49:47.199
car wash restaurant--

1237
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.201
Wax and Waffles, yeah.
What about it?


1238
00:49:49.202 --> 00:49:51.203
Did you inform them
that it was owned by
your own brother


1239
00:49:51.204 --> 00:49:55.107
and that his
last 3 businesses
had gone bankrupt?


1240
00:49:55.108 --> 00:49:57.442
Only one went bankrupt.
Excuse me.


1241
00:49:57.443 --> 00:49:59.244
2 were acts of God.

1242
00:49:59.245 --> 00:50:03.348
Acts of God. That would
be the fire and the enormous
gasoline explosion,


1243
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:05.617
both occurring in
the middle of the night?


1244
00:50:05.618 --> 00:50:07.820
The fact
that they occurred in
the middle of the night,


1245
00:50:07.821 --> 00:50:09.121
that's, uh, coincidence.

1246
00:50:09.122 --> 00:50:11.156
Yeah, the Lord works
in mysterious ways.


1247
00:50:11.157 --> 00:50:13.359
Jack, the sarcasm
isn't necessary.


1248
00:50:14.627 --> 00:50:15.660
Yes?

1249
00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:17.295
I'm really sorry,

1250
00:50:17.296 --> 00:50:20.632
but there's someone here
who says he has to
see Mr Lawrence.


1251
00:50:20.633 --> 00:50:22.200
Who is it?

1252
00:50:22.201 --> 00:50:25.303
I don't know, but he
looks a little strange,


1253
00:50:25.304 --> 00:50:28.040
and... he's...

1254
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:29.341
um...

1255
00:50:29.342 --> 00:50:31.044
Weeping?

1256
00:50:32.078 --> 00:50:35.181
Then it's for me.
Excuse me just a second.


1257
00:50:36.115 --> 00:50:39.284
All right, why don't
we take a break?


1258
00:50:39.285 --> 00:50:41.187
You're doing great.

1259
00:50:43.522 --> 00:50:45.724
Jack?

1260
00:50:45.725 --> 00:50:47.460
Ohh.

1261
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.934
What happened?

1262
00:50:55.935 --> 00:50:58.971
He poured hot coffee
all over my penis,


1263
00:50:58.972 --> 00:51:02.374
took my clothes,
and he ran away.


1264
00:51:02.375 --> 00:51:04.609
Don't cry.

1265
00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:07.947
Now, where is he?

1266
00:51:09.382 --> 00:51:11.017
I don't know.

1267
00:51:12.986 --> 00:51:15.653
I don't like you.

1268
00:51:15.654 --> 00:51:17.655
Don't.

1269
00:51:17.656 --> 00:51:20.092
OK.

1270
00:51:20.093 --> 00:51:20.994
Thank you.

1271
00:51:20.995 --> 00:51:22.928
Yeah, hi.
Is Jack Lawrence there?


1272
00:51:22.929 --> 00:51:26.064
I believe he's
taking a deposition.
This is his wife.


1273
00:51:26.065 --> 00:51:29.402
Um, do you wanna
get me a cab, please?
Thanks. What?


1274
00:51:30.736 --> 00:51:33.806
Reno? What? What
are you talking about?


1275
00:51:33.807 --> 00:51:36.208
Why--why is
he going to Reno?


1276
00:51:36.209 --> 00:51:39.111
Well, I--would you have
that flight information?


1277
00:51:39.112 --> 00:51:41.713
Dale: A rock festival
in Reno? I'm psyched.


1278
00:51:41.714 --> 00:51:43.115
Jack: I know.
It's awesome.


1279
00:51:43.116 --> 00:51:44.716
Shouldn't we
call Collette?


1280
00:51:44.717 --> 00:51:46.384
And tell her
we lost her son? No.


1281
00:51:46.385 --> 00:51:48.854
Oh, my batteries are dead,
and I have to talk to Carrie.


1282
00:51:48.855 --> 00:51:50.688
Well, use the pay phone.
We have time.


1283
00:51:50.689 --> 00:51:52.791
All right, I'll
be right over there.
I'll just be a second.


1284
00:51:52.792 --> 00:51:54.159
What?
Jack, I got
to get a new shirt.


1285
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.361
I mean, you know,
this one's really--


1286
00:51:56.362 --> 00:51:58.864
Can I have $20?

1287
00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:01.266
Look, I'm not a mad
terrorist. I'm his wife.


1288
00:52:01.267 --> 00:52:03.836
I just want to see if my
husband is on the plane.


1289
00:52:03.837 --> 00:52:05.904
I'm sorry.
It's a strict FAA rule.


1290
00:52:05.905 --> 00:52:07.840
I can't give out
that information.


1291
00:52:07.841 --> 00:52:09.107
All right, then,
Miss Tweesbury,


1292
00:52:09.108 --> 00:52:11.109
I'll just buy a ticket
for the plane.


1293
00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.945
OK, you have to
do that downstairs.


1294
00:52:12.946 --> 00:52:17.149
What? OK. Well, thanks
a lot for your help.
Really appreciate it.


1295
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.750
How the hell
I'm supposed to
make this flight.


1296
00:52:18.751 --> 00:52:21.454
It leaves in 5 minutes.

1297
00:52:29.362 --> 00:52:31.329
Ohh! Oh.

1298
00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:32.831
My purse.

1299
00:52:32.832 --> 00:52:33.866
You OK?

1300
00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:35.200
I'm fine.
Are you all right?


1301
00:52:35.201 --> 00:52:37.936
Yes, I'm OK.
Have we met?


1302
00:52:37.937 --> 00:52:39.905
No, I don't think so.

1303
00:52:39.906 --> 00:52:41.239
May I just say

1304
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.375
if springtime
had a face,
it would be you.


1305
00:52:43.376 --> 00:52:44.776
I'm-
-I--that's swell.

1306
00:52:44.777 --> 00:52:46.178
I'm in a hurry.

1307
00:52:46.179 --> 00:52:49.381
Bless you.
It's from one of
my longer poems.


1308
00:52:49.382 --> 00:52:51.683
It's called
Cupid's Shaft.


1309
00:52:51.684 --> 00:52:53.085
Dale. Dale, come on.

1310
00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:54.953
I just had a vision.

1311
00:52:54.954 --> 00:52:56.821
Me, too.
That is a bad shirt.


1312
00:52:56.822 --> 00:52:58.056
You don't like it?

1313
00:52:58.057 --> 00:52:59.124
What's wrong.
No.


1314
00:52:59.125 --> 00:53:01.493
It's fine. Come on.
Well, what?


1315
00:53:01.494 --> 00:53:03.028
Call your wife?

1316
00:53:03.029 --> 00:53:05.063
Yeah, but she's
not there.


1317
00:53:05.064 --> 00:53:06.764
Besides, what
can I tell her?


1318
00:53:06.765 --> 00:53:09.134
If he's not my son,
why bring it up?


1319
00:53:09.135 --> 00:53:11.203
And if he is my kid,

1320
00:53:11.204 --> 00:53:13.571
then it's not how
I want to tell her.


1321
00:53:13.572 --> 00:53:15.607
You care
about her a lot.


1322
00:53:15.608 --> 00:53:17.009
I can tell.

1323
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:18.944
She's great.
I love her a lot.


1324
00:53:18.945 --> 00:53:20.645
She's my favourite wife.
It's not even close.


1325
00:53:20.646 --> 00:53:23.848
And I don't want
to do anything
to screw it up.


1326
00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:25.383
How come you don't
have any children?


1327
00:53:25.384 --> 00:53:28.353
Well, the first 2 times
I was married,


1328
00:53:28.354 --> 00:53:29.754
I wasn't ready.

1329
00:53:29.755 --> 00:53:31.189
Then I thought
I was ready,


1330
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:32.590
but I wasn't married.

1331
00:53:32.591 --> 00:53:35.127
And now Carrie and I are
married just a year,


1332
00:53:35.128 --> 00:53:36.495
so it's new, you know?

1333
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.168
Jack.

1334
00:53:43.169 --> 00:53:44.103
What?

1335
00:53:44.104 --> 00:53:45.803
There's something
I should tell you.


1336
00:53:45.804 --> 00:53:46.905
What's that?

1337
00:53:46.906 --> 00:53:49.174
I'm somewhat
of a reluctant flyer.


1338
00:53:49.175 --> 00:53:52.344
Agent: You can go
right on board,
thank you.


1339
00:53:52.345 --> 00:53:53.179
Thank you.

1340
00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.580
Are you
a frequent flyer?


1341
00:53:56.182 --> 00:53:58.183
Because there's a new
mileage deal here.


1342
00:53:58.184 --> 00:54:00.218
You can apply today
for mileage plus.


1343
00:54:00.219 --> 00:54:01.819
Then you can get
a credit card


1344
00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.855
and you can get
a free mile


1345
00:54:03.856 --> 00:54:05.323
for every dollar
that you charge.


1346
00:54:05.324 --> 00:54:06.824
I think that's
a great deal.


1347
00:54:06.825 --> 00:54:07.960
Oh, God!

1348
00:54:07.961 --> 00:54:09.227
Just hold me!

1349
00:54:09.228 --> 00:54:10.496
That's a very good deal,
as a matter of fact.


1350
00:54:12.798 --> 00:54:15.167
Sir, take a big sip
of this.


1351
00:54:15.168 --> 00:54:16.901
Thank you.
Thank you.


1352
00:54:16.902 --> 00:54:18.170
You'll be
all right.


1353
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:19.973
Thank you.
Thank you.


1354
00:54:32.451 --> 00:54:34.052
Well, that's
pretty disgusting.


1355
00:54:34.053 --> 00:54:37.155
Well, we'll get
you cleaned up
real good there.


1356
00:54:37.156 --> 00:54:39.325
Turn around here.

1357
00:54:41.727 --> 00:54:43.195
Whoo. Let me
get in there.


1358
00:54:43.196 --> 00:54:44.796
You got a little
on your back here.


1359
00:54:44.797 --> 00:54:46.198
Turn around.
Come on.


1360
00:54:46.199 --> 00:54:47.632
Come on,
turn around.
There you go.


1361
00:54:47.633 --> 00:54:49.167
It's a miracle

1362
00:54:49.168 --> 00:54:50.902
that you didn't get,
like, really hurt
in that thing.


1363
00:54:50.903 --> 00:54:52.104
That went down
like a--


1364
00:54:52.105 --> 00:54:53.371
You know, I should
call my wife.


1365
00:54:53.372 --> 00:54:54.439
Now wait a minute.
Hold on.


1366
00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.673
Let me just get
your ear there.


1367
00:54:55.674 --> 00:54:56.841
You got
something in there


1368
00:54:56.842 --> 00:54:58.243
you really don't want
in there. Hoo!


1369
00:54:58.244 --> 00:55:01.513
Oh, here. Here's
some britches for you.


1370
00:55:01.514 --> 00:55:03.081
Hank gave you these.

1371
00:55:03.082 --> 00:55:04.549
There you go.

1372
00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:06.084
You'll be all right.

1373
00:55:06.085 --> 00:55:08.220
You got a little shit
there on your back.


1374
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:09.554
Whoo! I'll get it.

1375
00:55:09.555 --> 00:55:11.589
* Simmer down *

1376
00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.825
* Don't you hear
what I say? *


1377
00:55:13.826 --> 00:55:15.627
* Simmer down *

1378
00:55:15.628 --> 00:55:17.929
* Simmer and simmer *

1379
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:21.699
* Long time, people
used to say *


1380
00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.168
* Watch the money go *

1381
00:55:23.169 --> 00:55:24.902
* It's runnin' away *

1382
00:55:24.903 --> 00:55:27.205
* Simmer down *

1383
00:55:27.206 --> 00:55:29.141
* You workin' too hard *

1384
00:55:29.142 --> 00:55:31.377
* So simmer down... *

1385
00:55:38.517 --> 00:55:41.319
Hey, Scotty. I thought
we lost you.


1386
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.588
No. I just had
some stuff--


1387
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:45.157
You know what,
have you seen
Nikki around?


1388
00:55:45.158 --> 00:55:46.991
Yeah. We're
all crashed in 215.


1389
00:55:46.992 --> 00:55:48.326
She's up there
right now?


1390
00:55:48.327 --> 00:55:49.295
Yeah.

1391
00:55:49.296 --> 00:55:51.296
Look, I really wanted
to surprise her.


1392
00:55:51.297 --> 00:55:53.031
Could I borrow
your key?


1393
00:55:53.032 --> 00:55:54.399
Yeah, all right.

1394
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.334
Thanks.

1395
00:55:55.335 --> 00:55:57.502
Oh. Matt and Lee
are looking for you.


1396
00:55:57.503 --> 00:55:59.437
They're here?

1397
00:55:59.438 --> 00:56:01.439
Oh, yeah.

1398
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.209
Come on, man.

1399
00:56:07.846 --> 00:56:10.216
Open the door,
man.


1400
00:56:14.353 --> 00:56:15.820
Nikki?

1401
00:56:15.821 --> 00:56:17.723
Yeah. In here.

1402
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.527
Hey.

1403
00:56:22.528 --> 00:56:24.463
Hey. I made it.

1404
00:56:26.265 --> 00:56:28.733
I thought maybe you
went home or something.


1405
00:56:28.734 --> 00:56:30.335
No. Um...

1406
00:56:30.336 --> 00:56:31.803
Nikki, what's
going on?


1407
00:56:31.804 --> 00:56:34.106
What do you mean?

1408
00:56:34.107 --> 00:56:36.141
I mean with you
and Mark.


1409
00:56:36.142 --> 00:56:38.477
I don't know.

1410
00:56:42.915 --> 00:56:44.716
Do you still like me?

1411
00:56:44.717 --> 00:56:47.453
Yeah, Scott.

1412
00:56:49.988 --> 00:56:51.556
I got you something.

1413
00:56:51.557 --> 00:56:52.990
What is it?

1414
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:54.327
Open it.

1415
00:56:57.596 --> 00:56:59.131
Wow. Cool.

1416
00:56:59.132 --> 00:57:00.632
They're real diamonds.

1417
00:57:00.633 --> 00:57:03.302
I thought it might
look nice on you.


1418
00:57:08.541 --> 00:57:11.143
It cost $4,700.

1419
00:57:11.144 --> 00:57:12.411
Whoa.

1420
00:57:16.682 --> 00:57:18.450
Come on, let's do it.

1421
00:57:18.451 --> 00:57:20.985
Please, come on.
Please, please.


1422
00:57:20.986 --> 00:57:22.454
Oh, come on.

1423
00:57:22.455 --> 00:57:24.322
Back off!

1424
00:57:24.323 --> 00:57:25.923
I'm playing
that one, too.


1425
00:57:25.924 --> 00:57:27.292
Oh!

1426
00:57:27.293 --> 00:57:29.694
OK. I know the hotel
where the band
is staying.


1427
00:57:29.695 --> 00:57:32.029
I got directions.
We can be there
in 5 minutes.


1428
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.064
Yeah, yeah.

1429
00:57:33.065 --> 00:57:34.098
Hello.

1430
00:57:34.099 --> 00:57:35.200
Yeah.

1431
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:36.234
We're looking
for a kid, remember.


1432
00:57:36.235 --> 00:57:37.802
Oh, yeah.
OK, come on.


1433
00:57:37.803 --> 00:57:39.171
What is this outfit?

1434
00:57:39.172 --> 00:57:40.238
What?

1435
00:57:40.239 --> 00:57:41.606
I lent you $200,
and look at you.


1436
00:57:41.607 --> 00:57:43.141
You look like
Howdy Doody.
What is this?


1437
00:57:43.142 --> 00:57:44.876
It only cost
$110, Jack.


1438
00:57:44.877 --> 00:57:46.110
Oh. Where's my change?

1439
00:57:46.111 --> 00:57:48.146
It's in one
of these machines.


1440
00:57:48.147 --> 00:57:49.981
You put my money
in these machines?


1441
00:57:49.982 --> 00:57:51.983
Yeah. Ohh...

1442
00:57:51.984 --> 00:57:53.685
Damn you!

1443
00:57:53.686 --> 00:57:56.321
Jack, there's got to be
a blood bank open somewhere.


1444
00:57:56.322 --> 00:57:58.756
They give cash,
don't they?


1445
00:57:58.757 --> 00:57:59.791
Let's go.

1446
00:57:59.792 --> 00:58:00.826
OK.

1447
00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.162
Hey, guys.

1448
00:58:06.031 --> 00:58:07.299
Hello, Snot.

1449
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.401
Surprised
to see us, Snot?


1450
00:58:09.402 --> 00:58:10.236
No.

1451
00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:11.603
I think
you are, mate.


1452
00:58:11.604 --> 00:58:13.538
No. I was
coming down here
to look for you.


1453
00:58:13.539 --> 00:58:14.539
Oh, really?

1454
00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.875
Listen, Scott...
where's the stuff?


1455
00:58:17.876 --> 00:58:19.043
Stuff?

1456
00:58:19.044 --> 00:58:20.345
Hello. The stuff.

1457
00:58:20.346 --> 00:58:23.581
Look, we gave you
a simple little job.


1458
00:58:23.582 --> 00:58:25.783
I mean, any moron
could do it,


1459
00:58:25.784 --> 00:58:26.951
even Matt here.

1460
00:58:26.952 --> 00:58:28.186
Matt: Even me.

1461
00:58:28.187 --> 00:58:29.221
Yeah. In fact, if
I'm not mistaken,


1462
00:58:29.222 --> 00:58:30.622
you asked
for the job, right?


1463
00:58:30.623 --> 00:58:32.089
So now,
where's the stuff?


1464
00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:33.358
The guy--

1465
00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:34.926
he didn't show up.

1466
00:58:34.927 --> 00:58:36.127
No, no.
See, he called,


1467
00:58:36.128 --> 00:58:38.129
and you didn't show up.

1468
00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:39.897
No. I waited.

1469
00:58:39.898 --> 00:58:41.165
Look, let's
go over it.


1470
00:58:41.166 --> 00:58:42.700
I was supposed
to stand right by--


1471
00:58:42.701 --> 00:58:46.204
All right. You didn't
get the stuff, huh?


1472
00:58:46.205 --> 00:58:49.241
So, where's the money?

1473
00:58:49.242 --> 00:58:50.808
The money is--

1474
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:51.976
Our money!

1475
00:58:51.977 --> 00:58:53.978
The $5,000.
Where is it?


1476
00:58:53.979 --> 00:58:55.447
It's safe--
It's in a safe.


1477
00:58:55.448 --> 00:58:57.081
It's in a safe,
mate.


1478
00:58:57.082 --> 00:58:58.416
It's at the hotel
where I'm staying.


1479
00:58:58.417 --> 00:58:59.852
It's by the airport.

1480
00:59:01.153 --> 00:59:02.687
I'll go get it.

1481
00:59:02.688 --> 00:59:04.155
Oh, really?
Excuse me, but, uh...


1482
00:59:04.156 --> 00:59:05.690
do I have "asshole"

1483
00:59:05.691 --> 00:59:07.459
tattooed on my forehead
or something?


1484
00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.593
No.

1485
00:59:08.594 --> 00:59:11.095
All right. Well, I think
we all better go get it.


1486
00:59:11.096 --> 00:59:12.129
Hey? Yeah?

1487
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:13.598
Like a date.

1488
00:59:13.599 --> 00:59:14.666
Come here.

1489
00:59:14.667 --> 00:59:16.468
You're not bullshitting us,
are you, Scotty?


1490
00:59:16.469 --> 00:59:17.935
Because if you're
bullshitting us,


1491
00:59:17.936 --> 00:59:19.371
I'm gonna
kill you.


1492
00:59:19.372 --> 00:59:20.773
Watch your step
here, mate.


1493
00:59:22.207 --> 00:59:23.809
Hey!

1494
00:59:29.014 --> 00:59:30.282
Get back here!

1495
00:59:30.283 --> 00:59:32.617
Wait until
I catch you!


1496
00:59:32.618 --> 00:59:34.186
Move!

1497
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:39.491
Jack: I see this
all the time.


1498
00:59:39.492 --> 00:59:40.992
A rich kid
running wild.


1499
00:59:40.993 --> 00:59:42.460
Probably got
an expensive car,
running around town.


1500
00:59:42.461 --> 00:59:43.728
There's
no discipline.


1501
00:59:43.729 --> 00:59:45.530
Bob gives him
no control,
no boundaries.


1502
00:59:45.531 --> 00:59:47.198
Now Bob has no kid.

1503
00:59:47.199 --> 00:59:49.734
Oh, really? Well,
I think it's probably
exactly the opposite.


1504
00:59:49.735 --> 00:59:50.835
Really.

1505
00:59:50.836 --> 00:59:52.937
The kid needs compassion.
He needs attention.


1506
00:59:52.938 --> 00:59:54.238
He needs a big hug.

1507
00:59:54.239 --> 00:59:55.840
You know what
this kid needs?


1508
00:59:55.841 --> 00:59:57.241
What this kid needs
is a great big--


1509
00:59:57.242 --> 00:59:58.477
Aah!

1510
01:00:02.781 --> 01:00:04.316
I hit someone.

1511
01:00:04.317 --> 01:00:06.784
Yeah. It's not at all
like I imagined it.


1512
01:00:06.785 --> 01:00:07.886
Oh, God!

1513
01:00:09.855 --> 01:00:10.955
It's Scott!

1514
01:00:10.956 --> 01:00:11.989
My arm!

1515
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.157
Scott, are you
all right?


1516
01:00:13.158 --> 01:00:14.859
Are you OK?

1517
01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:15.893
Please call 911!

1518
01:00:15.894 --> 01:00:16.928
Calm down.

1519
01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:17.763
You hit our son!

1520
01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:18.963
It was an accident.
Shut up!


1521
01:00:18.964 --> 01:00:22.767
Did you call the hotel
in San Francisco?


1522
01:00:22.768 --> 01:00:25.603
Well, no, they must
be driving back.


1523
01:00:25.604 --> 01:00:28.341
No. I'm sure he's fine.

1524
01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:31.644
No, I'm OK.

1525
01:00:31.645 --> 01:00:32.777
No, I'm all right.
Yeah.


1526
01:00:32.778 --> 01:00:34.946
No. I'm driving
back right now.


1527
01:00:34.947 --> 01:00:36.048
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1528
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.217
No. I-
-I love you.

1529
01:00:40.218 --> 01:00:41.819
OK.

1530
01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.187
He's gonna kill us.

1531
01:00:43.188 --> 01:00:44.221
Oh, God.

1532
01:00:44.222 --> 01:00:46.257
Can you fix
the tyres?


1533
01:00:46.258 --> 01:00:48.361
Yeah, well, we can
fix the tyres.


1534
01:00:49.227 --> 01:00:50.261
But...

1535
01:00:50.262 --> 01:00:51.429
What?

1536
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.431
Well, he cracked
the axle


1537
01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:55.968
when he towed
the car back.


1538
01:00:59.505 --> 01:01:01.105
But don't worry.

1539
01:01:01.106 --> 01:01:03.007
We can fix it...
in a day or so,


1540
01:01:03.008 --> 01:01:04.443
maybe.

1541
01:01:07.713 --> 01:01:10.247
The doctor
says he's fine--
a simple break--


1542
01:01:10.248 --> 01:01:11.383
and he gave him
a prescription


1543
01:01:11.384 --> 01:01:12.584
in case there's
any pain.


1544
01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:14.452
He's in there.
You can go in.


1545
01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:15.788
Thanks a lot.

1546
01:01:18.924 --> 01:01:20.493
I didn't--
The--


1547
01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.994
It's been a long day.

1548
01:01:22.995 --> 01:01:24.028
Yeah. I'm--

1549
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:25.062
How you feeling?

1550
01:01:25.063 --> 01:01:26.097
Thanks.

1551
01:01:26.098 --> 01:01:27.131
Scott.
Scott.


1552
01:01:27.132 --> 01:01:28.367
Hey, come over here.

1553
01:01:29.902 --> 01:01:31.135
Hey, Scott.

1554
01:01:31.136 --> 01:01:32.169
Scott.

1555
01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:33.938
Scott, I'm sorry.

1556
01:01:33.939 --> 01:01:35.206
You ran me over.

1557
01:01:35.207 --> 01:01:36.608
It was an accident.

1558
01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:38.342
Yeah, I know you both
might be my father,


1559
01:01:38.343 --> 01:01:39.477
but just leave me alone.

1560
01:01:39.478 --> 01:01:41.479
What the hell was
my mother anyway,


1561
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.947
some kind of whore?

1562
01:01:42.948 --> 01:01:44.315
Hey! Watch your mouth.

1563
01:01:44.316 --> 01:01:46.584
Your mother was somebody
that we both cared
a lot about.


1564
01:01:46.585 --> 01:01:47.852
And she cares
a lot about you.


1565
01:01:47.853 --> 01:01:49.822
You know how
lucky you are
to have that?


1566
01:01:51.256 --> 01:01:53.558
Maybe, but--

1567
01:01:53.559 --> 01:01:55.627
You know,
you have no idea


1568
01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:57.128
what my father's like.

1569
01:01:57.129 --> 01:01:58.763
So, tell us.

1570
01:01:58.764 --> 01:02:01.332
Yeah. Nikki's the first girl
that I ever loved,


1571
01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:03.367
but my father
doesn't care.


1572
01:02:03.368 --> 01:02:04.669
He wouldn't let me
see her anymore.


1573
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:07.639
He said, "She's bad news.
She's a tramp."


1574
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.041
He said he's putting
his foot down.


1575
01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:11.443
Blah blah blah blah.

1576
01:02:11.444 --> 01:02:14.446
I mean, he never
lets me explain.


1577
01:02:14.447 --> 01:02:15.713
It's like,

1578
01:02:15.714 --> 01:02:17.181
for absolutely
no reason,


1579
01:02:17.182 --> 01:02:19.316
he'll just take
my car away.


1580
01:02:19.317 --> 01:02:20.886
You have a car?

1581
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.456
Yeah.

1582
01:02:24.957 --> 01:02:27.224
Scott, your father
is Mister Rogers.


1583
01:02:27.225 --> 01:02:30.495
You want to hear
a father story?


1584
01:02:30.496 --> 01:02:32.564
Here comes the lecture.

1585
01:02:32.565 --> 01:02:34.466
No. No lecture,
just a true story.


1586
01:02:34.467 --> 01:02:35.867
On my 10th birthday,

1587
01:02:35.868 --> 01:02:37.702
my father
takes me downtown


1588
01:02:37.703 --> 01:02:39.303
to go to the circus.

1589
01:02:39.304 --> 01:02:42.007
Wow. What a great story.

1590
01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:46.544
On the way downtown,

1591
01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:48.212
we drop my dog off
at the vet.


1592
01:02:48.213 --> 01:02:51.015
So, we go to the circus
and we have a great time.


1593
01:02:51.016 --> 01:02:53.117
I come home, and I go,
"Hey, where's Skippy?


1594
01:02:53.118 --> 01:02:56.888
They go, "Oh, we had
to put him to sleep."


1595
01:02:56.889 --> 01:03:00.357
I said,
"You mean he's dead?


1596
01:03:00.358 --> 01:03:02.494
You killed my dog?"

1597
01:03:02.495 --> 01:03:04.662
And he said, "Yeah.
He was sick.


1598
01:03:04.663 --> 01:03:06.063
That's why we brought him
to the vet."


1599
01:03:06.064 --> 01:03:07.164
And I said,

1600
01:03:07.165 --> 01:03:09.967
"Why did you have to do it
on my birthday?"


1601
01:03:09.968 --> 01:03:12.971
And he said,
"It was on the way."


1602
01:03:16.308 --> 01:03:17.576
Hmm?

1603
01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:22.581
What's the point?

1604
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:26.652
What is the point?

1605
01:03:29.087 --> 01:03:30.789
The point...

1606
01:03:31.624 --> 01:03:32.924
The point is...

1607
01:03:32.925 --> 01:03:36.227
that parents...

1608
01:03:36.228 --> 01:03:38.496
screw up sometimes

1609
01:03:38.497 --> 01:03:41.265
and that they
don't mean it


1610
01:03:41.266 --> 01:03:43.267
and that they
make mistakes


1611
01:03:43.268 --> 01:03:44.435
because they're
human beings.


1612
01:03:44.436 --> 01:03:46.771
Doesn't mean that
they don't love you.


1613
01:03:46.772 --> 01:03:48.172
Doesn't mean that
they don't care.


1614
01:03:48.173 --> 01:03:50.708
It just means
that, uh...


1615
01:03:50.709 --> 01:03:52.544
they're doing
the best they can.


1616
01:03:52.545 --> 01:03:54.747
You know?

1617
01:03:55.848 --> 01:03:58.517
I can't eat
any more of this.


1618
01:04:03.656 --> 01:04:04.922
Don't worry.

1619
01:04:04.923 --> 01:04:06.624
I didn't understand
the story either.


1620
01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:07.659
That's OK.

1621
01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.226
What about
the Rolling Stones?


1622
01:04:09.227 --> 01:04:10.261
Yeah.

1623
01:04:10.262 --> 01:04:11.295
They're old.

1624
01:04:11.296 --> 01:04:12.564
How about Zeppelin?

1625
01:04:12.565 --> 01:04:13.931
They had a nice logo.
I mean, they were OK.


1626
01:04:13.932 --> 01:04:15.499
Oh, but Jimi Hendrix.
I mean, come on.


1627
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.534
He was good,
but he's dead.


1628
01:04:16.535 --> 01:04:17.970
Speaking
of bad music.


1629
01:04:19.137 --> 01:04:20.738
Bad music. Oh, no, no.
You can't do it.


1630
01:04:20.739 --> 01:04:21.973
This was my band.

1631
01:04:21.974 --> 01:04:23.307
You can have
your Sugar Ray.


1632
01:04:23.308 --> 01:04:24.742
Sly and The Family Stone,

1633
01:04:24.743 --> 01:04:26.143
this was the band
I followed around.


1634
01:04:26.144 --> 01:04:27.178
Yeah.

1635
01:04:27.179 --> 01:04:28.345
Oh, feel that?

1636
01:04:28.346 --> 01:04:30.281
Uh-oh. Jack's
gonna funkify.


1637
01:04:30.282 --> 01:04:31.616
* I want to,
I want to *


1638
01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:33.484
Boom box: * I wanna
take you higher *


1639
01:04:33.485 --> 01:04:35.720
Watch out. It's
Denny Terrio's
Attorney Dance Party.


1640
01:04:35.721 --> 01:04:37.955
Get down and depose.

1641
01:04:37.956 --> 01:04:39.924
This is the worst
dancing I have
ever seen.


1642
01:04:39.925 --> 01:04:41.693
Everybody I know
dances like this.


1643
01:04:41.694 --> 01:04:43.194
You can't help
but wiggle your ass


1644
01:04:43.195 --> 01:04:44.596
when you listen
to Sly.


1645
01:04:44.597 --> 01:04:45.763
You're right, Jack.
Oh, wait a minute.


1646
01:04:45.764 --> 01:04:46.964
Hold on. Uh-oh.
I got my mojo.


1647
01:04:46.965 --> 01:04:49.233
There it is.
Uh-oh. Let it loose.


1648
01:04:49.234 --> 01:04:50.534
Watch out now!

1649
01:04:50.535 --> 01:04:53.105
Oh! Oh! Funky Chicken!

1650
01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:02.647
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!


1651
01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:03.915
When I was
in high school,


1652
01:05:03.916 --> 01:05:05.650
I had an afro
this big.


1653
01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:06.884
I don't believe you.

1654
01:05:06.885 --> 01:05:08.119
Oh, yeah. I needed help
lifting my head.


1655
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.353
I looked like Buckwheat
in a wind tunnel.


1656
01:05:09.354 --> 01:05:11.155
I once
shaved my head


1657
01:05:11.156 --> 01:05:13.257
and glued
all the hair
to my ass.


1658
01:05:13.258 --> 01:05:14.525
Why?
Why?


1659
01:05:14.526 --> 01:05:16.227
Well, 2 special
brownies


1660
01:05:16.228 --> 01:05:17.595
and a quart
of tequila.


1661
01:05:17.596 --> 01:05:18.630
Ahh.
Yeah.


1662
01:05:18.631 --> 01:05:20.665
So you two,
you were, like--


1663
01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.533
you were, like, freaks.

1664
01:05:22.534 --> 01:05:23.668
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.


1665
01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:24.969
I was
so stoned once,


1666
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:26.604
everyone
sounded like
Johnny Mathis.


1667
01:05:26.605 --> 01:05:27.639
* Eh eh eh... *

1668
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.073
When you're young,

1669
01:05:29.074 --> 01:05:31.809
you do some things
that, uh...


1670
01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:34.078
you're not
that proud of,
you know?


1671
01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:36.513
Yeah. We even got in a lot
of trouble sometimes.


1672
01:05:36.514 --> 01:05:38.216
You know?

1673
01:05:39.818 --> 01:05:44.055
Truth is, I'm in a lot
of trouble myself.


1674
01:05:44.056 --> 01:05:46.891
Does it have to do
with $5,000?


1675
01:05:46.892 --> 01:05:50.394
Scotty, we're not
here to judge.


1676
01:05:50.395 --> 01:05:52.263
Come on, tell us.

1677
01:05:52.264 --> 01:05:54.331
I stole that money.

1678
01:05:54.332 --> 01:05:55.700
OK.

1679
01:05:55.701 --> 01:05:57.769
From drug dealers.

1680
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:59.203
What, are you nuts?!

1681
01:05:59.204 --> 01:06:00.738
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1682
01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:02.039
What are you doing?

1683
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.208
Yelling like that doesn't
do anybody any good.


1684
01:06:04.209 --> 01:06:05.242
Just relax.

1685
01:06:05.243 --> 01:06:06.078
Sorry.

1686
01:06:06.079 --> 01:06:07.444
So, you give it
back to them.


1687
01:06:07.445 --> 01:06:09.180
Well, I spent it.

1688
01:06:09.181 --> 01:06:10.247
You spent it?!

1689
01:06:10.248 --> 01:06:12.116
He spent the money
from drug dealers!


1690
01:06:12.117 --> 01:06:13.951
That's not the way.
Breathe. Breathe.


1691
01:06:13.952 --> 01:06:15.720
You said I could
talk to you.


1692
01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:16.988
All right. OK.

1693
01:06:16.989 --> 01:06:18.723
Scott, you can't run
from these guys.


1694
01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:19.991
They'll find you.

1695
01:06:19.992 --> 01:06:21.592
They'll come
to your house,


1696
01:06:21.593 --> 01:06:22.760
take all your money,

1697
01:06:22.761 --> 01:06:24.028
and then beat
the shit out of you.


1698
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:25.963
It happened to me
a couple of times.


1699
01:06:25.964 --> 01:06:27.231
Listen.

1700
01:06:27.232 --> 01:06:28.465
Let me talk to them.

1701
01:06:28.466 --> 01:06:31.535
I do this kind of thing
all the time. All right?


1702
01:06:31.536 --> 01:06:34.772
Why are you trying
to help me?


1703
01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:36.307
We're your fathers.

1704
01:06:36.308 --> 01:06:38.676
Come on.

1705
01:06:38.677 --> 01:06:42.046
* Never had
to knock on wood *


1706
01:06:42.047 --> 01:06:44.682
* But I know someone
who has *


1707
01:06:44.683 --> 01:06:47.051
* which makes you wonder
if I could *


1708
01:06:47.052 --> 01:06:49.153
* It makes me
wonder if I *


1709
01:06:49.154 --> 01:06:52.924
* Never had
to knock on wood *


1710
01:06:52.925 --> 01:06:54.458
* And if I ever get... *

1711
01:06:54.459 --> 01:06:55.927
Let's do this!

1712
01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:58.062
OK, I'm calling
in this big fat guy
from Jersey.


1713
01:06:58.063 --> 01:06:59.663
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where
are you going, speedy?


1714
01:06:59.664 --> 01:07:01.098
Kick some ass.

1715
01:07:01.099 --> 01:07:02.566
There will be
no ass kicking.


1716
01:07:02.567 --> 01:07:03.701
Do you understand that?

1717
01:07:03.702 --> 01:07:04.736
All right, let's go.
Come on.


1718
01:07:04.737 --> 01:07:05.770
What are you doing?

1719
01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:07.004
I'm coming with you.

1720
01:07:07.005 --> 01:07:08.005
You are not
coming with us.
Yes, I am.


1721
01:07:08.006 --> 01:07:09.240
I don't want you
with us.


1722
01:07:09.241 --> 01:07:10.075
They're crazy.

1723
01:07:10.076 --> 01:07:11.308
I want you to get
in the car.


1724
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:12.744
Get in the car.

1725
01:07:12.745 --> 01:07:14.011
OK. Look,
I need water.


1726
01:07:14.012 --> 01:07:15.780
I'll get you
some water.


1727
01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:17.614
Listen, the phone
is right there.


1728
01:07:17.615 --> 01:07:19.350
Call your mother.

1729
01:07:19.351 --> 01:07:20.651
Tell her
that you're OK


1730
01:07:20.652 --> 01:07:22.253
and that you're
coming home.
All right?


1731
01:07:22.254 --> 01:07:23.287
All right.

1732
01:07:23.288 --> 01:07:24.521
Thanks.

1733
01:07:24.522 --> 01:07:26.924
We're gonna
kick some ass, Jack.


1734
01:07:26.925 --> 01:07:28.726
Get in the car.

1735
01:07:28.727 --> 01:07:29.861
Now.

1736
01:07:29.862 --> 01:07:32.263
OK, you ready, buddy?

1737
01:07:32.264 --> 01:07:33.731
If this is gonna work,

1738
01:07:33.732 --> 01:07:35.968
you have got
to calm down.


1739
01:07:45.543 --> 01:07:46.577
Calm down.

1740
01:07:46.578 --> 01:07:47.880
All right.

1741
01:07:55.153 --> 01:07:57.154
It's them!

1742
01:07:57.155 --> 01:07:58.223
Jack!

1743
01:07:59.324 --> 01:08:02.327
Jack! Dale!

1744
01:08:31.556 --> 01:08:33.758
Scheming little...

1745
01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:38.296
Jack.

1746
01:08:39.364 --> 01:08:40.397
Excuse me.

1747
01:08:40.398 --> 01:08:41.698
What's going on?

1748
01:08:41.699 --> 01:08:42.867
They're not
in the hotel.


1749
01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:43.901
He's gone.

1750
01:08:43.902 --> 01:08:45.436
In what sense?

1751
01:08:45.437 --> 01:08:46.938
In the sense that he
stole my rental car
and he left.


1752
01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.140
I have never felt
this stupid in my life.


1753
01:08:49.141 --> 01:08:52.076
Jack, you've never
been a parent
before.


1754
01:08:52.077 --> 01:08:53.045
Man.

1755
01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:56.247
Dale, this is way
too much trouble.


1756
01:08:56.248 --> 01:08:57.681
I can't do this.

1757
01:08:57.682 --> 01:08:59.350
I have a life.

1758
01:08:59.351 --> 01:09:01.853
You're not giving up?

1759
01:09:01.854 --> 01:09:03.454
Dale, good luck.

1760
01:09:03.455 --> 01:09:06.424
I mean that.
I'm sorry.


1761
01:09:08.026 --> 01:09:09.726
I got to go
call my wife


1762
01:09:09.727 --> 01:09:10.962
and tell her that
I'm coming home.


1763
01:09:10.963 --> 01:09:12.029
Jack.
No.


1764
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:13.998
I know we've had
a few setbacks,


1765
01:09:13.999 --> 01:09:15.532
but we're great
together.


1766
01:09:15.533 --> 01:09:16.767
Oh, come on.

1767
01:09:16.768 --> 01:09:18.035
You'll never know
if he's your son.


1768
01:09:18.036 --> 01:09:19.636
You know what?
I don't even care.


1769
01:09:19.637 --> 01:09:20.671
Yeah, you do.

1770
01:09:20.672 --> 01:09:22.273
You care.
Yeah, you do.


1771
01:09:22.274 --> 01:09:23.307
Stop it.

1772
01:09:23.308 --> 01:09:25.576
Machine again.
She's never home.


1773
01:09:25.577 --> 01:09:27.111
Why have a house

1774
01:09:27.112 --> 01:09:29.881
if you're not
gonna live in it?


1775
01:09:29.882 --> 01:09:31.115
Hi, honey.

1776
01:09:31.116 --> 01:09:31.950
Hi.

1777
01:09:31.951 --> 01:09:33.417
Oh, you're there.

1778
01:09:33.418 --> 01:09:35.752
Carrie, listen.
Let me explain
everything.


1779
01:09:35.753 --> 01:09:37.222
Yeah, why don't
you go ahead?


1780
01:09:43.195 --> 01:09:44.195
Hi.

1781
01:09:44.196 --> 01:09:45.930
I got to go now,
honey,


1782
01:09:45.931 --> 01:09:47.332
because
you're here.


1783
01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:51.102
Ignore that message
when you get home.


1784
01:09:51.103 --> 01:09:53.005
This is your wife?

1785
01:09:54.406 --> 01:09:55.639
It's you.

1786
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.673
Hi.

1787
01:09:56.674 --> 01:09:58.075
You know him?

1788
01:09:58.076 --> 01:09:59.476
He tried to pick me up
in an airport.


1789
01:09:59.477 --> 01:10:00.912
When?
No, I didn't.
This morning.


1790
01:10:00.913 --> 01:10:01.946
You were with me.

1791
01:10:01.947 --> 01:10:02.980
You were
on the phone.


1792
01:10:02.981 --> 01:10:04.048
So you picked up
on my wife?


1793
01:10:04.049 --> 01:10:05.182
I didn't know
she was your wife.


1794
01:10:05.183 --> 01:10:06.984
I just thought she
was a sexy woman.


1795
01:10:06.985 --> 01:10:08.019
Watch that.

1796
01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.386
This is your friend.

1797
01:10:09.387 --> 01:10:10.421
Yes.

1798
01:10:10.422 --> 01:10:11.655
Your shower buddy.

1799
01:10:11.656 --> 01:10:12.823
Yes?
No.


1800
01:10:12.824 --> 01:10:14.091
We were never
in the shower together.


1801
01:10:14.092 --> 01:10:15.559
No. The boy and I
were in the shower.


1802
01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.161
Yeah. He was
soaping him up--
And hosing him off.


1803
01:10:17.162 --> 01:10:19.964
And I was just watching.
That's all.


1804
01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:22.300
What boy?

1805
01:10:23.668 --> 01:10:24.936
17 years ago--

1806
01:10:24.937 --> 01:10:26.470
Would you stop?
Would you--


1807
01:10:26.471 --> 01:10:29.773
Can I just have
a private moment
with my wife, please?


1808
01:10:29.774 --> 01:10:31.176
Sorry.

1809
01:10:32.377 --> 01:10:34.179
Carrie, come here.

1810
01:10:35.547 --> 01:10:36.713
Um...

1811
01:10:36.714 --> 01:10:38.650
this whole thing...

1812
01:10:40.418 --> 01:10:42.387
is about a boy...

1813
01:10:44.056 --> 01:10:47.292
that I might be
the father of.


1814
01:10:53.765 --> 01:10:55.600
Carrie,
it's a long story.


1815
01:11:03.108 --> 01:11:05.342
There's a cab.

1816
01:11:05.343 --> 01:11:06.945
Taxi.

1817
01:11:09.982 --> 01:11:11.915
Sorry if I ruined
your life.


1818
01:11:11.916 --> 01:11:13.250
Oh, no. You haven't.

1819
01:11:13.251 --> 01:11:15.819
He wanted to come home,
and I kept pushing him.


1820
01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.054
It's all right.
Really. Don't worry.


1821
01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:18.789
OK, but it's
not his fault.


1822
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:19.823
OK.

1823
01:11:19.824 --> 01:11:21.058
OK. Really,
it isn't.


1824
01:11:21.059 --> 01:11:23.094
Thanks. OK.
Take it easy.


1825
01:11:23.095 --> 01:11:24.128
Bye.
Bye-bye.


1826
01:11:24.129 --> 01:11:26.965
Carrie, I'll just
be a second.


1827
01:11:28.566 --> 01:11:30.534
You know, even if
you find him again,


1828
01:11:30.535 --> 01:11:32.869
he's only gonna
spit in your face.


1829
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:34.038
Maybe.

1830
01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:36.773
How is that gonna
make you feel, Dale?


1831
01:11:36.774 --> 01:11:38.809
You're very
successful.


1832
01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:41.412
So?

1833
01:11:41.413 --> 01:11:42.779
Wife,

1834
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.081
your success,

1835
01:11:44.082 --> 01:11:46.418
they fill up...
areas.


1836
01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.188
What I'm trying
to say is...


1837
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:52.789
I need this kid.

1838
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:55.192
If he doesn't
want me around,


1839
01:11:55.193 --> 01:11:57.996
let him
turn me down.


1840
01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:04.768
Good luck, Dale.

1841
01:12:04.769 --> 01:12:06.004
Thanks, Jack.

1842
01:12:34.366 --> 01:12:35.400
Taxi!

1843
01:12:36.968 --> 01:12:38.270
Taxi!

1844
01:12:54.786 --> 01:12:56.288
Scott?

1845
01:13:13.605 --> 01:13:15.439
Uh, my car is there,

1846
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.808
so you'll have
to go home,
and I'll follow.


1847
01:13:17.809 --> 01:13:19.610
Yeah. We can
work it out.


1848
01:13:19.611 --> 01:13:21.145
You can't be mad

1849
01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:23.080
that I had sex
with this woman

1850
01:13:23.081 --> 01:13:24.948
You were

1851
01:13:24.949 --> 01:13:26.150
Do you have
a picture?


1852
01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:27.751
Of her? No.

1853
01:13:27.752 --> 01:13:29.353
Of the boy, Jack.

1854
01:13:29.354 --> 01:13:30.522
Yeah.

1855
01:13:39.664 --> 01:13:41.965
He's--he's handsome.

1856
01:13:41.966 --> 01:13:46.203
I guess, but
this kid is a major
pain in the ass.


1857
01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:47.572
He's so damn
annoying.


1858
01:13:48.573 --> 01:13:50.574
You don't like anything
that's annoying.


1859
01:13:50.575 --> 01:13:51.842
Who does?

1860
01:13:51.843 --> 01:13:54.745
No. I mean, that's a really
special thing for you.


1861
01:13:54.746 --> 01:13:56.313
Give me a break.

1862
01:13:56.314 --> 01:13:57.781
I've had a hard day.

1863
01:13:57.782 --> 01:13:59.082
Oh, you've had
a hard day.


1864
01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:00.884
Why should I
give you a break?


1865
01:14:00.885 --> 01:14:03.254
'Cause I don't
want to have this
conversation again.


1866
01:14:03.255 --> 01:14:05.289
We have never had
this conversation.


1867
01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:06.957
No, we have never had
this conversation,


1868
01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:08.692
but I have had
this conversation.


1869
01:14:08.693 --> 01:14:10.961
This is "The wives
of Christmas past"
conversation.


1870
01:14:10.962 --> 01:14:13.764
Would you leave Penelope
and Talullah out of this?


1871
01:14:13.765 --> 01:14:15.166
Iris and Debbie.

1872
01:14:15.167 --> 01:14:16.501
Whatever.

1873
01:14:19.204 --> 01:14:21.205
Why are you
so upset?


1874
01:14:21.206 --> 01:14:22.606
I am so upset

1875
01:14:22.607 --> 01:14:24.107
because I want to have
kids with you someday,


1876
01:14:24.108 --> 01:14:25.909
and what if this
was our son?


1877
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:27.077
Would you
give up on him


1878
01:14:27.078 --> 01:14:29.180
because he was
so annoying?


1879
01:14:29.181 --> 01:14:31.215
His own father
gave up on him.


1880
01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:32.249
So what?

1881
01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:34.685
That's the guy
who raised him.


1882
01:14:34.686 --> 01:14:37.188
All I am is the guy
who, you know,


1883
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:38.789
slept
with his mother.


1884
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:41.292
Well, the other guy
who slept with his mother


1885
01:14:41.293 --> 01:14:43.126
is still out there
looking for him.


1886
01:14:43.127 --> 01:14:44.161
Dale?

1887
01:14:44.162 --> 01:14:46.062
Dale is a desperate
person


1888
01:14:46.063 --> 01:14:47.431
with an empty life.

1889
01:14:47.432 --> 01:14:49.301
He's not happy
like me.


1890
01:14:56.841 --> 01:14:57.874
Badge.

1891
01:14:57.875 --> 01:14:58.909
Badge?

1892
01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:00.177
No. You don't
understand.


1893
01:15:00.178 --> 01:15:02.946
I--I belong
back there.


1894
01:15:02.947 --> 01:15:05.216
Please. I just have
to get back there
right now.


1895
01:15:05.217 --> 01:15:06.783
Do you know who
you're talking to?


1896
01:15:06.784 --> 01:15:08.185
Do you know
who I am?


1897
01:15:08.186 --> 01:15:09.220
Who?

1898
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:10.821
Dale Putley, OK?

1899
01:15:10.822 --> 01:15:11.922
And who are you?

1900
01:15:11.923 --> 01:15:13.357
I'm Bob.

1901
01:15:13.358 --> 01:15:14.825
Bob? Well, Bob,
if you don't
let me back there,


1902
01:15:14.826 --> 01:15:15.793
heads are
gonna roll,


1903
01:15:15.794 --> 01:15:17.160
and it's probably
gonna be yours, Bob.


1904
01:15:17.161 --> 01:15:18.195
You're not getting in
without a badge.


1905
01:15:18.196 --> 01:15:19.696
Do you know
who I am?


1906
01:15:19.697 --> 01:15:21.432
I am
the cowboy with the
Village People, Bob.


1907
01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.166
If I don't
get back there,


1908
01:15:23.167 --> 01:15:25.202
it's just gonna be
Y.M.- A., OK?


1909
01:15:25.203 --> 01:15:26.437
So, Bob, let me
back there,


1910
01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:27.604
all right?
Right now.


1911
01:15:27.605 --> 01:15:30.173
You're not getting in
without a badge.


1912
01:15:30.174 --> 01:15:31.742
OK.

1913
01:15:31.743 --> 01:15:32.577
A badge.

1914
01:15:32.578 --> 01:15:34.246
I can't get in
without a badge.


1915
01:15:35.613 --> 01:15:37.548
Jack! Oh!

1916
01:15:37.549 --> 01:15:38.383
OK.

1917
01:15:38.384 --> 01:15:40.050
Let's get in there,
all right?


1918
01:15:40.051 --> 01:15:42.520
Here's my badge,
Bob!


1919
01:15:45.089 --> 01:15:46.357
OK, you guys, listen.

1920
01:15:46.358 --> 01:15:48.225
The Muffs are off
in 10 minutes, OK?


1921
01:15:48.226 --> 01:15:51.262
We should be setting up
in about 5, all right?


1922
01:15:51.263 --> 01:15:52.829
That's the band.

1923
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:53.864
Oh.

1924
01:15:53.865 --> 01:15:55.232
Come on.
Follow me.


1925
01:15:55.233 --> 01:15:56.367
What are we
going to do?


1926
01:15:56.368 --> 01:15:57.501
Hello, boys.
How are you?


1927
01:15:57.502 --> 01:15:59.236
Excuse me.
Can I help you?


1928
01:15:59.237 --> 01:16:00.971
Hey. Excuse me.
That's very funny.


1929
01:16:00.972 --> 01:16:02.138
I love when
it's funny.


1930
01:16:02.139 --> 01:16:03.173
Hi. Stu Gold
from the agency.


1931
01:16:03.174 --> 01:16:04.207
How can
I help you?


1932
01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:05.676
How can you help me?

1933
01:16:05.677 --> 01:16:06.910
You can say hello
to the biggest
record producer


1934
01:16:06.911 --> 01:16:07.779
this side of the lake.

1935
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.947
This is, uh...
Gunther Uber Allen


1936
01:16:10.948 --> 01:16:12.215
from Deutsche Be
-Bop.

1937
01:16:12.216 --> 01:16:13.717
Biggest record producer
in Europe.


1938
01:16:13.718 --> 01:16:15.619
Ja. Numero ein.

1939
01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.187
So, say hi to the guys.
This is Sugar Ray.


1940
01:16:17.188 --> 01:16:19.089
Sugar Ray?

1941
01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:20.457
Oh, der wunderkinder.

1942
01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:21.492
The boys in the bundt.

1943
01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:22.726
I think we met before,
dude.


1944
01:16:22.727 --> 01:16:24.328
Dusseldorf, maybe.

1945
01:16:24.329 --> 01:16:25.496
Klaus, how are you?

1946
01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:26.797
What's up mit you?

1947
01:16:26.798 --> 01:16:28.399
Hi, how are you?
Give me a high five.


1948
01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.600
Oh, that's
how it starts.


1949
01:16:29.601 --> 01:16:32.068
I love you mit,
eh...


1950
01:16:32.069 --> 01:16:34.271
Hitting mit
der strumming mit
die head slamming.


1951
01:16:34.272 --> 01:16:35.406
Who does
this guy record?


1952
01:16:35.407 --> 01:16:37.841
Oh, biggest producer
in Germany.


1953
01:16:37.842 --> 01:16:40.278
Records, uh...

1954
01:16:46.017 --> 01:16:47.218
The Cars.

1955
01:16:52.023 --> 01:16:53.424
Uh, Big Hairy Women.

1956
01:16:53.425 --> 01:16:55.326
Yeah, in America--
Boys 2 Women.


1957
01:16:55.327 --> 01:16:56.928
I have heard
about those guys.


1958
01:17:00.298 --> 01:17:01.533
Excuse me.

1959
01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:06.069
But if we have you,
we could take Europe.


1960
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:07.438
We could take Europe
in what?


1961
01:17:07.439 --> 01:17:09.139
One month.
With air support.


1962
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.173
Air play.

1963
01:17:10.174 --> 01:17:11.207
Air play.

1964
01:17:11.208 --> 01:17:12.409
Ja, that's better.

1965
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:13.444
We could do that
for you.


1966
01:17:13.445 --> 01:17:15.512
You could have
the world!


1967
01:17:15.513 --> 01:17:18.015
Come on.
It's time to go.


1968
01:17:21.185 --> 01:17:22.218
Not here.

1969
01:17:22.219 --> 01:17:23.420
What do you mean?
Where is he?


1970
01:17:23.421 --> 01:17:24.688
I don't know.

1971
01:17:24.689 --> 01:17:26.458
Stick with the girl.
He'll be back.


1972
01:17:28.493 --> 01:17:31.194
Nikki, I'm sorry.
I need that pin back.


1973
01:17:31.195 --> 01:17:32.228
What pin?

1974
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:33.364
Sorry, Nikki,
I need it back.


1975
01:17:33.365 --> 01:17:34.598
Scott.

1976
01:17:34.599 --> 01:17:36.299
Leave me alone.
Please, I need that pin.


1977
01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.601
Scott, what's wrong?
Why'd you steal the car?


1978
01:17:37.602 --> 01:17:38.769
You're not going home?

1979
01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:41.605
Here are the keys.
Just leave me alone.


1980
01:17:41.606 --> 01:17:42.973
Nikki,
can't we just talk?


1981
01:17:42.974 --> 01:17:44.941
Not now, Scotty,
I'm going to dance
on stage.


1982
01:17:44.942 --> 01:17:48.011
Hey, look, everybody's
tired of you. Enough.


1983
01:17:48.012 --> 01:17:51.047
Stop this.
This has gone on
long enough.


1984
01:17:51.048 --> 01:17:53.417
I thought
he was German.


1985
01:17:53.418 --> 01:17:56.319
Nikki, can you
do me a favour?


1986
01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:02.993
Explain to Scott that
which is painfully obvious
to everybody but him.


1987
01:18:02.994 --> 01:18:05.061
OK.

1988
01:18:05.062 --> 01:18:06.364
Thanks.

1989
01:18:07.298 --> 01:18:08.799
This is none
of your business.


1990
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.734
Maybe, but you
need to hear this.


1991
01:18:10.735 --> 01:18:12.836
Nikki, he's not
gonna believe it


1992
01:18:12.837 --> 01:18:14.705
unless you tell him
yourself.


1993
01:18:14.706 --> 01:18:16.840
OK.

1994
01:18:16.841 --> 01:18:19.610
Well, Scotty,
you're boring.


1995
01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:21.945
I liked you
for a while,


1996
01:18:21.946 --> 01:18:24.481
but now I
can't stand
looking at you.


1997
01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:27.519
Even your voice
makes me sick.


1998
01:18:30.988 --> 01:18:32.489
It was lovely.

1999
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:34.290
Yes, Hallmark
is waiting for you.


2000
01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:36.027
Thank you.

2001
01:18:37.462 --> 01:18:40.163
Hey, Scott, she's
not for you, son.


2002
01:18:40.164 --> 01:18:41.398
Scott: I feel like
such a loser.


2003
01:18:41.399 --> 01:18:44.334
Dale: Scott, come on,
you're 16.


2004
01:18:44.335 --> 01:18:47.337
To be a true loser takes
years of dedicated
ineptitude.


2005
01:18:47.338 --> 01:18:48.805
Trust me.

2006
01:18:48.806 --> 01:18:51.975
Jack: There will be
other girls, you'll see.


2007
01:18:51.976 --> 01:18:52.910
I know the truth hurts.

2008
01:18:52.911 --> 01:18:54.478
I'll tell you
what else hurts.


2009
01:18:54.479 --> 01:18:56.780
I trusted him,
and he steals the car.


2010
01:18:56.781 --> 01:18:58.081
Look, I didn't
steal it.


2011
01:18:58.082 --> 01:19:00.917
I don't want to talk
about it right now.


2012
01:19:00.918 --> 01:19:02.686
Oh, no.

2013
01:19:02.687 --> 01:19:04.788
No, no, get him
out of here.


2014
01:19:04.789 --> 01:19:07.257
Please, this man has
a major mime issue.


2015
01:19:07.258 --> 01:19:09.093
I'll hang you,
you white-faced creep.


2016
01:19:10.895 --> 01:19:11.796
Here, stop it.

2017
01:19:11.797 --> 01:19:13.063
Why don't you get
a real job, huh?


2018
01:19:13.064 --> 01:19:14.431
Build a real wall.

2019
01:19:14.432 --> 01:19:16.166
Stop it.
Would you just stop it?


2020
01:19:16.167 --> 01:19:17.200
Scotty?

2021
01:19:17.201 --> 01:19:19.202
Jack!
Jack, no!


2022
01:19:19.203 --> 01:19:20.471
We lost the boy.

2023
01:19:20.472 --> 01:19:22.038
Where did he go?

2024
01:19:22.039 --> 01:19:23.907
Get out of here!

2025
01:19:23.908 --> 01:19:25.543
All right,
we're not good at this.


2026
01:19:30.548 --> 01:19:32.315
You go that way,
I'll go this way.


2027
01:19:32.316 --> 01:19:33.618
OK.

2028
01:19:37.789 --> 01:19:38.855
Scott?

2029
01:19:38.856 --> 01:19:39.724
Yeah?

2030
01:19:39.725 --> 01:19:41.057
I thought you were
somebody else.


2031
01:19:41.058 --> 01:19:42.026
I'm Scott.

2032
01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:44.194
Hi. Hey, uh, you--
you want something?


2033
01:19:44.195 --> 01:19:46.196
You want
a nose-ring pierce?


2034
01:19:46.197 --> 01:19:47.931
N-no, thanks.
Another time.


2035
01:19:47.932 --> 01:19:48.766
Does that hurt?

2036
01:19:48.767 --> 01:19:51.702
Not the ones
in the face.


2037
01:19:51.703 --> 01:19:52.803
Ugh.

2038
01:19:52.804 --> 01:19:55.005
The--the one that
really hurts--


2039
01:19:55.006 --> 01:19:56.207
Yeah, I bet.
Scott!


2040
01:19:59.043 --> 01:20:02.412
Come on! Let's
take a little walk!
Get off of me!


2041
01:20:02.413 --> 01:20:04.481
Scott!

2042
01:20:04.482 --> 01:20:05.516
Excuse me!

2043
01:20:05.517 --> 01:20:06.550
Is there
a problem here?


2044
01:20:06.551 --> 01:20:07.751
Piss off!
Who are you?


2045
01:20:07.752 --> 01:20:09.252
I'm Scott's father.

2046
01:20:09.253 --> 01:20:10.587
Has he done
something wrong?


2047
01:20:10.588 --> 01:20:11.622
Yeah, he has,
actually.


2048
01:20:11.623 --> 01:20:13.824
He stole $5,000
from me.


2049
01:20:13.825 --> 01:20:15.158
He did?

2050
01:20:15.159 --> 01:20:16.359
Yeah.

2051
01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.094
Well, I assure
you, he will be
properly punished.


2052
01:20:18.095 --> 01:20:21.164
Young man,
stealing money
from drug dealers!


2053
01:20:21.165 --> 01:20:22.099
You are grounded,
mister!


2054
01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.667
All right, just get knotted,
wanker!


2055
01:20:23.668 --> 01:20:26.302
Gentlemen, have we
learned nothing


2056
01:20:26.303 --> 01:20:28.304
from the music
of John Lennon?


2057
01:20:28.305 --> 01:20:29.840
All we need is love.

2058
01:20:29.841 --> 01:20:31.876
No! All we need's money,
mate!


2059
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:33.944
Oh!

2060
01:20:33.945 --> 01:20:34.779
Oh!

2061
01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:37.380
Do you have
an Advil?


2062
01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:38.649
Oh, it's you again.

2063
01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:40.483
You're dead, mate.
No, you are.


2064
01:20:40.484 --> 01:20:42.285
Ah!

2065
01:20:42.286 --> 01:20:44.722
Oh, boy!

2066
01:20:45.723 --> 01:20:47.290
You're doing it wrong!

2067
01:20:47.291 --> 01:20:48.725
I noticed.

2068
01:20:48.726 --> 01:20:51.729
The power comes from
your back! Watch.
Like this...


2069
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:55.700
See? Let me
show you again.


2070
01:20:57.802 --> 01:20:59.136
Hey!

2071
01:21:06.811 --> 01:21:09.479
Who else wants
a piece of me?!


2072
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.447
No! No!

2073
01:21:11.448 --> 01:21:12.983
Let's get 'em, boys!

2074
01:21:12.984 --> 01:21:15.286
I'll take you out!
I'll be there!


2075
01:21:29.266 --> 01:21:31.135
Bob:
Yeah, right here.


2076
01:21:38.542 --> 01:21:42.746
Listen, Calvin,
thanks for going
so far out of your way.


2077
01:21:42.747 --> 01:21:44.981
It's really above
and beyond the call.


2078
01:21:44.982 --> 01:21:47.317
Whoa-ho!
Look at this place.


2079
01:21:47.318 --> 01:21:49.219
You must have
robbed a bank at
some time or another.


2080
01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.054
Yeah. It's...

2081
01:21:50.055 --> 01:21:52.689
Scotty's probably
home by now.


2082
01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:54.224
I'm kind of nervous
about what to say
to him.


2083
01:21:54.225 --> 01:21:57.460
Listen, can I give you
just a little bit
of advice here?


2084
01:21:57.461 --> 01:21:58.729
Yeah.

2085
01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:01.064
Yeah, all right. Uh,
stop being so stiff, OK?


2086
01:22:01.065 --> 01:22:04.968
And lighten up
and take that pickle
out of your butt, boy.


2087
01:22:04.969 --> 01:22:06.369
Ha ha. OK.

2088
01:22:06.370 --> 01:22:07.638
Listen, listen...

2089
01:22:07.639 --> 01:22:09.773
It's not enough
to love him.


2090
01:22:09.774 --> 01:22:11.775
You gotta show him
you love him.


2091
01:22:11.776 --> 01:22:13.243
Give him a big old
bear hug.


2092
01:22:13.244 --> 01:22:14.277
Aah.

2093
01:22:14.278 --> 01:22:15.311
All right?

2094
01:22:15.312 --> 01:22:16.346
Listen, Calvin,
thank you.


2095
01:22:16.347 --> 01:22:18.281
All right.
Ain't nothin', man.


2096
01:22:18.282 --> 01:22:19.315
OK. Take care
of yourself.


2097
01:22:19.316 --> 01:22:21.017
I will. Listen...

2098
01:22:21.018 --> 01:22:21.853
I'll call you.

2099
01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:23.319
You got my number.

2100
01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.355
You got it.

2101
01:22:25.356 --> 01:22:26.389
This is for my fine.

2102
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:27.423
This is for his fine.

2103
01:22:27.424 --> 01:22:28.759
This is for the boy's fine.

2104
01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.161
This is for getting the car
out of the impound.


2105
01:22:31.162 --> 01:22:34.798
This is for the fabulous
breakfast buffet that
we had this morning.


2106
01:22:34.799 --> 01:22:36.266
Are eggs
supposed to make noise
when you eat them?


2107
01:22:36.267 --> 01:22:37.801
Very funny.

2108
01:22:37.802 --> 01:22:39.970
Here's your
claim check
for your car.


2109
01:22:39.971 --> 01:22:41.204
And stay out
of trouble.


2110
01:22:41.205 --> 01:22:42.238
Yes, sir.

2111
01:22:42.239 --> 01:22:43.140
Thanks.

2112
01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:45.142
See you next year
at the reunion.


2113
01:22:48.245 --> 01:22:51.147
I go away for a minute
to make a phone call


2114
01:22:51.148 --> 01:22:52.683
and you buy
this T-shirt?


2115
01:22:52.684 --> 01:22:53.784
Look at this.

2116
01:22:53.785 --> 01:22:54.951
What's the big deal?
He wanted it.


2117
01:22:54.952 --> 01:22:56.186
You're going
to spoil him.


2118
01:22:56.187 --> 01:22:57.988
One T-shirt's
going to spoil him.


2119
01:22:57.989 --> 01:22:59.323
I like it.

2120
01:23:03.427 --> 01:23:04.828
What's the matter?

2121
01:23:04.829 --> 01:23:07.164
I'm afraid of flying.

2122
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.266
Give me a minute.

2123
01:23:10.267 --> 01:23:12.703
No, no. Come--
this is not exactly
DNA evidence, OK?


2124
01:23:12.704 --> 01:23:13.737
Maybe.

2125
01:23:13.738 --> 01:23:14.771
Come on.

2126
01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:16.172
It'll be fine.
Let's go.


2127
01:23:16.173 --> 01:23:18.375
Don't--don't be
afraid, Scotty.


2128
01:23:24.181 --> 01:23:25.215
Hey, hey...

2129
01:23:25.216 --> 01:23:26.083
It's OK.

2130
01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:28.318
Just a couple
of bumps, Scotty.


2131
01:23:28.319 --> 01:23:29.452
You're doing great.

2132
01:23:29.453 --> 01:23:31.321
You're doing great.

2133
01:23:31.322 --> 01:23:32.856
It's OK. Breathe.

2134
01:23:32.857 --> 01:23:34.357
There you go.

2135
01:23:34.358 --> 01:23:36.092
Just breathe.

2136
01:23:36.093 --> 01:23:37.829
OK.

2137
01:23:44.368 --> 01:23:45.401
Thank you.

2138
01:23:45.402 --> 01:23:46.904
That's OK.

2139
01:24:09.193 --> 01:24:11.627
Hey, your
shoe's untied.
I got it.


2140
01:24:11.628 --> 01:24:13.164
I got it.

2141
01:24:14.098 --> 01:24:16.299
It's hard
with one hand.


2142
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.135
There you go.

2143
01:24:30.081 --> 01:24:31.514
Scott.

2144
01:24:31.515 --> 01:24:33.583
Hi, dad.

2145
01:24:33.584 --> 01:24:35.651
Come in, man.
Come in. Are you OK?


2146
01:24:35.652 --> 01:24:36.686
Yeah.

2147
01:24:36.687 --> 01:24:37.921
Everything
all right? Huh?


2148
01:24:37.922 --> 01:24:39.255
Really?
Are you all right?


2149
01:24:39.256 --> 01:24:40.824
Really? You OK?

2150
01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:42.358
You had me
kind of worried.


2151
01:24:42.359 --> 01:24:43.961
Come here.

2152
01:24:48.265 --> 01:24:49.665
Oh, I'm-
-I'm sorry.

2153
01:24:49.666 --> 01:24:50.967
I'm sorry. Bob.

2154
01:24:50.968 --> 01:24:52.368
Jack Lawrence, Bob.

2155
01:24:52.369 --> 01:24:53.304
Dale Putley.

2156
01:24:53.305 --> 01:24:54.570
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.


2157
01:24:54.571 --> 01:24:55.605
Your mom's in the back.

2158
01:24:55.606 --> 01:24:56.840
Nice home.

2159
01:24:56.841 --> 01:24:57.874
Come on in.
What happened
to your arm?


2160
01:24:57.875 --> 01:24:59.309
A little accident.

2161
01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:02.313
Bob: Well, you won't believe
what happened to me.


2162
01:25:15.392 --> 01:25:16.659
Oh...

2163
01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.795
Bright.

2164
01:25:18.796 --> 01:25:21.498
What colour yellow
is this?


2165
01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:32.309
Baby...

2166
01:25:33.344 --> 01:25:35.446
Oh, sweetheart.

2167
01:25:40.384 --> 01:25:42.785
Collette: Oh, Scott.

2168
01:25:42.786 --> 01:25:44.521
Ohh...

2169
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:54.431
Nice family.

2170
01:25:56.367 --> 01:25:57.969
Yeah.

2171
01:25:59.837 --> 01:26:02.472
Ahh!
Ahh!


2172
01:26:02.473 --> 01:26:05.275
Such a cute baby.

2173
01:26:05.276 --> 01:26:06.944
Ohh.
Hmm.


2174
01:26:08.812 --> 01:26:11.647
Look at this
little cowboy hat, huh?


2175
01:26:11.648 --> 01:26:13.917
Oh, I love this one.
I'm going to take that one.


2176
01:26:13.918 --> 01:26:16.352
You can't take that.
It belongs to them.


2177
01:26:16.353 --> 01:26:18.122
Yeah. You're right.

2178
01:26:21.325 --> 01:26:22.459
Look at that.

2179
01:26:35.339 --> 01:26:38.875
Do you understand
the situation?


2180
01:26:38.876 --> 01:26:40.143
Yeah, you, uh,

2181
01:26:40.144 --> 01:26:42.545
you told them both that
they were my father


2182
01:26:42.546 --> 01:26:44.214
so that they'd come
look for me, right?


2183
01:26:44.215 --> 01:26:45.049
Right.

2184
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:46.549
I lied to them.

2185
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:48.919
Well,
your mother--


2186
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.955
both of us
wanted you back
so badly--


2187
01:26:51.956 --> 01:26:53.223
I understand.

2188
01:26:53.224 --> 01:26:56.927
I think it's time
I told them the truth.


2189
01:26:56.928 --> 01:27:00.563
Would you guys mind
if I told them?


2190
01:27:00.564 --> 01:27:01.597
You?

2191
01:27:01.598 --> 01:27:02.999
Well, I guess
I'm the reason


2192
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.402
that everything
happened, right?


2193
01:27:06.403 --> 01:27:08.405
**

2194
01:27:14.111 --> 01:27:15.778
Where's, uh, Jack?

2195
01:27:15.779 --> 01:27:19.515
In the den,
calling his office.


2196
01:27:19.516 --> 01:27:20.783
You OK?

2197
01:27:20.784 --> 01:27:22.352
Everything...

2198
01:27:22.353 --> 01:27:23.386
all right?

2199
01:27:23.387 --> 01:27:24.420
Yeah.

2200
01:27:24.421 --> 01:27:25.788
Yeah, I just, um...

2201
01:27:25.789 --> 01:27:28.058
I just talked
to my mom.


2202
01:27:28.059 --> 01:27:29.459
Oh, you did?
Yeah.


2203
01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:33.364
She told me who
my real father is.


2204
01:27:34.565 --> 01:27:36.099
Who is it?

2205
01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.401
She says it's you.

2206
01:27:38.402 --> 01:27:40.603
Really?

2207
01:27:40.604 --> 01:27:42.238
She says she's sure.

2208
01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:45.376
Oh, God.
Come here.


2209
01:27:48.912 --> 01:27:51.081
Oh.
I knew the whirl--


2210
01:27:51.082 --> 01:27:53.816
Shh! Shh!
We should be--
we should be quiet.


2211
01:27:53.817 --> 01:27:55.118
I'm worried about Jack.

2212
01:27:55.119 --> 01:27:57.720
Oh, yeah. You're right.
You're right.


2213
01:27:57.721 --> 01:27:59.289
We shouldn't tell him.

2214
01:27:59.290 --> 01:28:00.124
Right.

2215
01:28:00.125 --> 01:28:02.125
It would break
his heart.


2216
01:28:02.126 --> 01:28:03.626
He seems tough,

2217
01:28:03.627 --> 01:28:05.328
but he's so fragile.

2218
01:28:05.329 --> 01:28:06.362
Yeah.

2219
01:28:06.363 --> 01:28:07.430
Ha ha ha ha.

2220
01:28:07.431 --> 01:28:10.300
It'll be our
little secret.
OK?


2221
01:28:10.301 --> 01:28:14.604
You know--you know, I was,
uh, I was thinking...


2222
01:28:14.605 --> 01:28:17.573
Maybe in a few years
I'll come to Berkeley.


2223
01:28:17.574 --> 01:28:18.975
Ohh, yes, son.

2224
01:28:18.976 --> 01:28:20.010
Yeah.

2225
01:28:20.011 --> 01:28:21.844
Hey...

2226
01:28:21.845 --> 01:28:22.878
Take photography.

2227
01:28:22.879 --> 01:28:23.913
Hmm?

2228
01:28:23.914 --> 01:28:25.181
Photography?

2229
01:28:25.182 --> 01:28:27.917
I just called
my office, and
good news--


2230
01:28:27.918 --> 01:28:29.120
everything went bad
without me.


2231
01:28:30.154 --> 01:28:31.754
It's not that funny.

2232
01:28:31.755 --> 01:28:34.824
No, no.
No, it isn't.


2233
01:28:34.825 --> 01:28:36.692
I'm going to go
call the airport,


2234
01:28:36.693 --> 01:28:38.562
see when the next flight
to San Francisco...


2235
01:28:42.433 --> 01:28:43.966
What's with him?

2236
01:28:43.967 --> 01:28:46.969
Oh, he just--
he told me a funny story.


2237
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:48.071
Ho ho. Yeah.

2238
01:28:48.072 --> 01:28:49.472
Hee hee.

2239
01:28:49.473 --> 01:28:51.907
So you know,
I--I was talking
to my mom before...


2240
01:28:51.908 --> 01:28:53.544
Oh, yeah?

2241
01:28:55.046 --> 01:28:58.315
She told me who
my real father is.


2242
01:29:04.288 --> 01:29:06.023
Who?

2243
01:29:07.324 --> 01:29:09.026
You.

2244
01:29:10.327 --> 01:29:11.495
Me?

2245
01:29:15.032 --> 01:29:16.400
Wow.

2246
01:29:25.576 --> 01:29:27.810
Dale, I'm so happy.

2247
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:30.012
Me, too, Collette.

2248
01:29:30.013 --> 01:29:31.047
Thank you.

2249
01:29:31.048 --> 01:29:32.448
Oh, thank you.

2250
01:29:32.449 --> 01:29:34.884
Listen, Jack,
I--I really,
really appreciate


2251
01:29:34.885 --> 01:29:36.018
everything
you've done.


2252
01:29:36.019 --> 01:29:39.290
He told me.

2253
01:29:41.158 --> 01:29:44.295
Scotty...
Ha ha ha ha.


2254
01:29:48.799 --> 01:29:50.800
Jack, thank you.

2255
01:29:50.801 --> 01:29:53.036
Hmm. You're welcome.

2256
01:29:59.210 --> 01:30:00.843
Dale: Oh, boy.

2257
01:30:00.844 --> 01:30:02.613
OK. See ya.

2258
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:08.485
Good-bye.

2259
01:30:18.795 --> 01:30:20.096
So...

2260
01:30:20.097 --> 01:30:21.831
Why don't you
come on in,


2261
01:30:21.832 --> 01:30:22.898
relax, have
a drink, or...


2262
01:30:22.899 --> 01:30:24.334
take a swim
if you want.


2263
01:30:24.335 --> 01:30:26.436
That's very sweet
of you, Jack,
but you know what?


2264
01:30:26.437 --> 01:30:28.904
I'll just come in,
call a cab, and...


2265
01:30:28.905 --> 01:30:30.440
head down
to the airport, OK?


2266
01:30:30.441 --> 01:30:32.775
Oh, OK.

2267
01:30:32.776 --> 01:30:34.177
You know what?

2268
01:30:34.178 --> 01:30:36.312
Take my car.

2269
01:30:36.313 --> 01:30:38.013
You're giving me
your car, Jack?


2270
01:30:38.014 --> 01:30:41.050
I mean, that's
so Elvis of you.
I mean, this is a big--


2271
01:30:41.051 --> 01:30:42.084
Not to keep.

2272
01:30:42.085 --> 01:30:43.219
No?

2273
01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.954
No. To take
to the airport.


2274
01:30:44.955 --> 01:30:46.122
Oh.

2275
01:30:46.123 --> 01:30:47.923
Yeah. You put it
in the overnight valet


2276
01:30:47.924 --> 01:30:50.126
and one of my
interns will get it
in the morning. Here.


2277
01:30:50.127 --> 01:30:52.061
Are you sure you want me
driving this car?


2278
01:30:52.062 --> 01:30:53.095
I mean, Jack...

2279
01:30:53.096 --> 01:30:54.130
It's just a thing.

2280
01:30:54.131 --> 01:30:55.165
Yes.

2281
01:30:55.166 --> 01:30:56.266
It's a car.
A car.


2282
01:30:56.267 --> 01:30:57.300
It's just a...

2283
01:30:57.301 --> 01:30:58.901
classic...
Mm-hmm.


2284
01:30:58.902 --> 01:30:59.935
irreplaceable...

2285
01:30:59.936 --> 01:31:01.337
car, that's all.

2286
01:31:01.338 --> 01:31:04.507
What's this dent?
Where?


2287
01:31:04.508 --> 01:31:05.908
Ha ha ha.

2288
01:31:05.909 --> 01:31:07.177
You mirth machine,
you.


2289
01:31:07.178 --> 01:31:08.844
Ha ha ha.

2290
01:31:08.845 --> 01:31:10.680
Ahh, boy.

2291
01:31:10.681 --> 01:31:12.183
Thanks, Jack.

2292
01:31:13.150 --> 01:31:14.884
We did good.

2293
01:31:14.885 --> 01:31:16.387
Yeah, we did.

2294
01:31:17.688 --> 01:31:19.223
Yeah.

2295
01:31:24.161 --> 01:31:25.195
Oh, Jack.

2296
01:31:25.196 --> 01:31:26.862
Let it out.

2297
01:31:26.863 --> 01:31:29.365
It's so healthy, Jack.

2298
01:31:29.366 --> 01:31:31.034
It's a breakthrough.

2299
01:31:32.068 --> 01:31:33.303
No.

2300
01:31:33.304 --> 01:31:34.970
What?
No. I'm cocking
around with you.


2301
01:31:34.971 --> 01:31:37.273
This is
what you look like,
you weepy bastard.


2302
01:31:37.274 --> 01:31:38.541
Ha ha ha ha!

2303
01:31:38.542 --> 01:31:39.875
Oh, Jack.

2304
01:31:39.876 --> 01:31:43.479
Ohh! Uhh!
Ohh, I love you!


2305
01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.316
Please.
My sternum.
Oh.


2306
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:55.525
A little less gas.

2307
01:31:55.526 --> 01:31:57.092
It's not going
anywhere, Jack.


2308
01:31:57.093 --> 01:31:58.127
The brake's on.

2309
01:31:58.128 --> 01:31:59.161
OK.

2310
01:31:59.162 --> 01:32:00.796
You just go that way,
a left--


2311
01:32:00.797 --> 01:32:02.097
it's all
under control.


2312
01:32:02.098 --> 01:32:03.999
Ease off the clutch.
You won't get
that burning smell.


2313
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.269
OK.

2314
01:32:08.138 --> 01:32:09.572
OK. Don't worry.

2315
01:32:09.573 --> 01:32:11.275
I'm not worried
at all.
I got it.


2316
01:32:15.212 --> 01:32:16.812
I'm an idiot.

2317
01:32:16.813 --> 01:32:18.682
I'm a big schmuck.

2318
01:32:21.918 --> 01:32:23.754
Hi.

2319
01:32:25.322 --> 01:32:27.890
You loaned Dale
your Jaguar?


2320
01:32:27.891 --> 01:32:29.158
Yeah.

2321
01:32:29.159 --> 01:32:31.461
Hi.

2322
01:32:31.462 --> 01:32:32.696
Hi.

2323
01:32:35.098 --> 01:32:36.766
Jack...

2324
01:32:36.767 --> 01:32:37.800
Jack, how...

2325
01:32:37.801 --> 01:32:40.270
How did it go?

2326
01:32:40.271 --> 01:32:42.906
Scott told me
I'm his father.


2327
01:32:44.808 --> 01:32:45.841
Oh.

2328
01:32:45.842 --> 01:32:46.877
Wow.

2329
01:32:48.879 --> 01:32:50.112
Yep.

2330
01:32:50.113 --> 01:32:52.114
I feel good.

2331
01:32:52.115 --> 01:32:54.216
I feel terrific.

2332
01:32:54.217 --> 01:32:56.118
It's--it's, uh,

2333
01:32:56.119 --> 01:32:57.152
amazing.

2334
01:32:57.153 --> 01:32:59.221
Yeah.
It's wonderful news.


2335
01:32:59.222 --> 01:33:02.458
He was lying to me,
but I still feel great.


2336
01:33:02.459 --> 01:33:03.826
Wait, wait. What?

2337
01:33:03.827 --> 01:33:05.795
Oh. Right to my face.

2338
01:33:05.796 --> 01:33:07.096
Big-time lie.

2339
01:33:07.097 --> 01:33:08.598
How do you know?

2340
01:33:08.599 --> 01:33:10.866
Honey, I'm a lawyer.
People lie to me
all the time.


2341
01:33:10.867 --> 01:33:12.868
Oh. Yeah.

2342
01:33:12.869 --> 01:33:14.404
He's a sweet kid.

2343
01:33:14.405 --> 01:33:16.906
He lied to me because
he wanted me to feel good.


2344
01:33:16.907 --> 01:33:18.173
And I did.

2345
01:33:18.174 --> 01:33:21.176
Just the idea of being
somebody's father


2346
01:33:21.177 --> 01:33:23.514
made me feel wonderful.

2347
01:33:24.781 --> 01:33:26.148
Yeah?

2348
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:27.817
So here's what
I'm thinking:


2349
01:33:27.818 --> 01:33:29.251
For the next one,

2350
01:33:29.252 --> 01:33:31.355
I'd like to be there
from the beginning.


2351
01:33:35.626 --> 01:33:38.894
Well, would I be
involved this time?


2352
01:33:38.895 --> 01:33:40.396
Oh, I hope so.

2353
01:33:40.397 --> 01:33:43.434
I mean,
from the beginning.


2354
01:33:55.312 --> 01:33:57.647
* Hmm hmm-hmm hmm-hmm *

2355
01:33:57.648 --> 01:33:59.081
* Hmm-hmm hmm-hmm *

2356
01:33:59.082 --> 01:34:00.149
* Hmm hmm *

2357
01:34:00.150 --> 01:34:02.051
* Be-lee-lee deh-deh *

2358
01:34:02.052 --> 01:34:03.118
Pow.

2359
01:34:03.119 --> 01:34:04.286
* Hmm hmm-hmm hmm-- *

2360
01:34:04.287 --> 01:34:05.321
Oh...

2361
01:34:05.322 --> 01:34:06.356
Houston,

2362
01:34:06.357 --> 01:34:08.023
we have a problem.

2363
01:34:08.024 --> 01:34:09.326
Mayday.

2364
01:34:13.797 --> 01:34:14.830
Hi.

2365
01:34:14.831 --> 01:34:16.198
Hi.

2366
01:34:16.199 --> 01:34:18.000
Car problem?

2367
01:34:18.001 --> 01:34:19.034
Yeah.

2368
01:34:19.035 --> 01:34:20.069
Oh.

2369
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:21.103
Phew.

2370
01:34:21.104 --> 01:34:23.639
Maybe I could be
of assistance.


2371
01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.741
Do you know anything
about cars?


2372
01:34:25.742 --> 01:34:26.577
Oh, yeah.

2373
01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:28.878
Somewhat of an expert
on cars.


2374
01:34:28.879 --> 01:34:29.713
Oh, terrific.

2375
01:34:29.714 --> 01:34:32.081
Well,
w-what do you think?


2376
01:34:32.082 --> 01:34:33.182
This one's
not working.


2377
01:34:33.183 --> 01:34:34.617
It's a rental.

2378
01:34:34.618 --> 01:34:36.218
I'm on my way
to the airport,
and I'm late.


2379
01:34:36.219 --> 01:34:37.987
Well, I'm on my way
to the airport.


2380
01:34:37.988 --> 01:34:41.491
I have a 4:00 flight
to San Francisco.


2381
01:34:41.492 --> 01:34:42.758
That's my flight.

2382
01:34:42.759 --> 01:34:43.793
Really?

2383
01:34:43.794 --> 01:34:44.827
Yeah-
-United.

2384
01:34:44.828 --> 01:34:45.861
321?
Right.


2385
01:34:45.862 --> 01:34:47.029
Oh. Me, too.

2386
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:49.965
How richly bizarre.

2387
01:34:49.966 --> 01:34:51.266
Here we go.

2388
01:34:51.267 --> 01:34:53.002
I'm at your service.

2389
01:34:53.003 --> 01:34:54.169
It's a beautiful car.

2390
01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:56.171
Thanks.
I just got it.


2391
01:34:56.172 --> 01:34:58.140
There you go.
Everybody in?


2392
01:34:58.141 --> 01:34:59.376
Yeah.

2393
01:35:02.813 --> 01:35:03.847
Hi.

2394
01:35:08.084 --> 01:35:09.118
Oh...

2395
01:35:09.119 --> 01:35:11.787
I'm Virginia Farrell.

2396
01:35:11.788 --> 01:35:12.822
Dale Putley.

2397
01:35:12.823 --> 01:35:13.857
Hi.

2398
01:35:18.995 --> 01:35:22.164
Will anybody
be meeting you
at the airport?


2399
01:35:22.165 --> 01:35:23.566
Like a husband?

2400
01:35:23.567 --> 01:35:25.501
No. I'm--I'm
not married.


2401
01:35:25.502 --> 01:35:28.671
Oh. Me--me neither.

2402
01:35:28.672 --> 01:35:30.272
You have a boyfriend?

2403
01:35:30.273 --> 01:35:31.306
No.

2404
01:35:31.307 --> 01:35:32.475
Me neither.

2405
01:35:32.476 --> 01:35:35.411
Have you ever been
to the wine country?


2406
01:35:35.412 --> 01:35:37.146
No.
I've always
wanted to go.


2407
01:35:37.147 --> 01:35:39.148
Really?
Ha ha ha ha!


2408
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:41.284
Oh, yes!

2409
01:35:42.318 --> 01:35:43.352
Dale: Jack?

2410
01:35:43.353 --> 01:35:44.386
Yeah?

2411
01:35:44.387 --> 01:35:45.421
Guess who?

2412
01:35:45.422 --> 01:35:46.556
Oh.

2413
01:35:46.557 --> 01:35:48.424
You know how I hate
to fly, Jackie?


2414
01:35:48.425 --> 01:35:49.459
Where are you?

2415
01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:50.960
Somewhere on
the coast highway.


2416
01:35:50.961 --> 01:35:53.328
You shouldn't be
anywhere near
the coast highway!


2417
01:35:53.329 --> 01:35:54.964
I'm driving
to San Francisco.


2418
01:35:54.965 --> 01:35:56.131
In my car? No way.

2419
01:35:56.132 --> 01:35:57.733
I've got to do this,
Jack.
No, you don't.


2420
01:35:57.734 --> 01:35:59.935
The road is calling me.
I was born to be wild.


2421
01:35:59.936 --> 01:36:02.905
No, you weren't, Dale.
No. No wild.


2422
01:36:02.906 --> 01:36:07.109
* I saw you swaying
to the rhythm of the music *


2423
01:36:07.110 --> 01:36:08.911
* Caught you playing *

2424
01:36:08.912 --> 01:36:12.783
* Caught you praying
to the voice inside you *


2425
01:36:15.285 --> 01:36:17.854
* I saw you
swaying there *


2426
01:36:19.022 --> 01:36:20.723
* I don't care *

2427
01:36:20.724 --> 01:36:23.058
* What you wanna be *

2428
01:36:23.059 --> 01:36:24.460
* I go back so far *

2429
01:36:24.461 --> 01:36:26.128
* I'm in front of me *

2430
01:36:26.129 --> 01:36:30.099
* It doesn't matter
what they say *


2431
01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:33.335
* They're giving
the game away *


2432
01:36:33.336 --> 01:36:34.369
* Hey *

2433
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:37.107
* Hey *

2434
01:36:38.374 --> 01:36:40.944
* I can see
the world tonight *


2435
01:36:42.378 --> 01:36:44.681
* Look into the future *

2436
01:36:46.416 --> 01:36:49.019
* See it in
a different light *


2437
01:36:50.086 --> 01:36:53.123
* I can see
the world tonight *


2438
01:36:56.126 --> 01:37:00.863
* I heard you listening
to a secret conversation *


2439
01:37:00.864 --> 01:37:02.632
* You were crying *

2440
01:37:02.633 --> 01:37:06.837
* You were trying not
to let them hear you *


2441
01:37:08.371 --> 01:37:11.207
* I heard you listenin' in *

2442
01:37:12.408 --> 01:37:14.243
* Well, never mind *

2443
01:37:14.244 --> 01:37:16.546
* What they wanna do *

2444
01:37:16.547 --> 01:37:18.280
* You've got a right *

2445
01:37:18.281 --> 01:37:20.082
* To your point of view *

2446
01:37:20.083 --> 01:37:23.819
* It doesn't matter
what they say *


2447
01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:27.089
* They're giving
the game away *


2448
01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:28.123
* Hey *

2449
01:37:28.124 --> 01:37:30.727
* Hey *

2450
01:37:32.128 --> 01:37:34.731
* I can see
the world tonight *


2451
01:37:36.232 --> 01:37:38.268

01:37:39.803 --> 01:37:43.806

2455
