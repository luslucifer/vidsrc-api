00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:08.305
C'mon girl!

2
00:02:09.124 --> 00:02:11.714
Let's go before all
the damn alcohol dries up.

3
00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:14.764
Look, we'll just stay for a little bit.

4
00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:18.374
Trust me, it's good for you to get
out among some people your own damn age.

5
00:02:18.374 --> 00:02:19.594
We spend enough time with those...

6
00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:20.984
Okay.

7
00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:22.954
Okay, I know you like them

8
00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:22.961
Okay, I know you like them
- Just come on, girl!


9
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.420
- Just come on, girl!

10
00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:41.264
I say goddam,

11
00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:43.204
I say goddam!

12
00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:46.514
So nice, you said it twice.

13
00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:48.124
I'll take a bump, Ms. Hoover.

14
00:02:54.444 --> 00:02:55.024
That's it?

15
00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:57.224
Go easy, B-rad.

16
00:02:57.494 --> 00:02:59.234
This is primo shit.

17
00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:00.974
Trained professionals only.

18
00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:08.614
You ain't kidding.

19
00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:11.984
I definitely want more of this superlative snow.

20
00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:13.924

21
00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:18.824

24
00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:25.074

27
00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:37.954
Damn, I'm not about that rehabbound life, girl.

28
00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:39.424
I just meant the Devil's Lettuce.

29
00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:40.324

00:04:32.454 --> 00:04:34.724
What's up, bitches?

35
00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:36.874
What up, girl?

36
00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:42.884
Hey everybody, this is Stephanie, she's awesome.

37
00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:44.274
Stop it.

38
00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:45.494
Hi, everyone.

39
00:04:45.924 --> 00:04:49.944
She's also shy as shit, so
you dbags better make her feel welcome.

40
00:04:50.014 --> 00:04:51.144
Francesca, stop.

41
00:04:52.134 --> 00:04:54.494
Alright, who's got a shot for us.

42
00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:05.114
Why thank you, kind sir.

43
00:05:05.114 --> 00:05:07.224
Let's get it poppin'.

44
00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:10.004
Haven't seen you at
Black Bean in a minute?

45
00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:13.014
Been busy as shit, working
these doubles, which kill me,

46
00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:16.214
so even when I'm free I'm
too dead to do anything but Netflix.

47
00:05:16.374 --> 00:05:17.204
No "and chillin'"?

48
00:05:17.204 --> 00:05:18.284
Nu-uh.

49
00:05:18.954 --> 00:05:19.714
Damn.

50
00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:24.194
How's the, uh, the book coming along?

51
00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:29.504
There is something at work in
my soul, which I don't understand.

52
00:05:31.594 --> 00:05:34.214
That, uh, a line from it, or?..

53
00:05:34.644 --> 00:05:36.704
That's my homegirl Mary Shelley.

54
00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:41.104
I'm just a little
blocked, right now, it'll pass.

55
00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:53.424
So you work with Francesca, right?

56
00:05:54.304 --> 00:05:55.204
Yeah.

57
00:05:57.564 --> 00:06:00.624
How do you like,
uh, that line of work?

58
00:06:00.884 --> 00:06:01.684
Okay.

59
00:06:04.124 --> 00:06:05.104
Okay, well...

60
00:06:05.104 --> 00:06:06.324
How do you know, everyone?

61
00:06:08.424 --> 00:06:11.224
That one there...is Rachel.

62
00:06:11.514 --> 00:06:14.754
This is her place - well, her parents,

63
00:06:14.754 --> 00:06:15.984
So she lives here with them?

64
00:06:15.984 --> 00:06:17.204
No,

65
00:06:17.424 --> 00:06:20.414
Rachel is not into
having roommates of any sort.

66
00:06:20.664 --> 00:06:22.264
She has a studio downtown.

67
00:06:22.884 --> 00:06:23.684
Oh.

68
00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:26.304
So do you live around here, Hawthorne?

69
00:06:26.644 --> 00:06:28.904
Oh. Only moved here last year.

70
00:06:28.904 --> 00:06:30.904
Lived closer to the city before.

71
00:06:30.904 --> 00:06:32.564
Oh word, me too.

72
00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:35.604
But I've been around
here for a minute now.

73
00:06:43.104 --> 00:06:43.734
Ew.

74
00:06:54.808 --> 00:06:55.391
Good?

75
00:06:55.757 --> 00:06:56.892
Oh yeah!

76
00:06:57.048 --> 00:06:58.694
And we look good.

77
00:07:13.384 --> 00:07:16.900
This scumbag, "councilman" Maestro, it's like...

78
00:07:17.025 --> 00:07:18.801
Oh yeah, so gross, I saw

79
00:07:18.808 --> 00:07:21.471
- all that shit
with like young, teenage girls

80
00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:23.467
Seriously such a pervert.

81
00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:24.397
What is wrong with men?

82
00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:26.180
-They are all disgusting.

83
00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:26.964
Agreed.

84
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:32.172
This guy is from our
town though, and it's like, trending...

85
00:07:32.412 --> 00:07:34.465
Yeah, that is kinda cool.

86
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:36.610
At least we're on the map for something.

87
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:38.069
Let me see that.

88
00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.814
And his wife is
â€˜standing strong at his side.'

89
00:07:43.982 --> 00:07:45.536
Jesus, that's pathetic.

90
00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:47.913
Why don't these women
just leave these douche canoes?

91
00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:48.812
God.

92
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.545
It's probably more complicated than that.

93
00:07:50.763 --> 00:07:52.774
Whatever. Just seems really weak to me.

94
00:08:59.479 --> 00:09:01.029
You are so gorgeous.

95
00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:02.298
Shut up.

96
00:09:35.102 --> 00:09:36.305
What's your rush?

97
00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:37.982
It's my party...

98
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:41.254
I'm the host...have to get down there.

99
00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:43.905
Okay. ...You're the boss, as usual.

100
00:09:44.504 --> 00:09:47.178
I'd think you wouldn't want people
to wonder what you were doing, no?

101
00:09:47.189 --> 00:09:49.003
Whatever, I'm not the one in a "relationship."

102
00:09:51.513 --> 00:09:52.622
Seeya down there, cowboy.

103
00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.395
Another obsession?

104
00:10:13.528 --> 00:10:15.524
Huh? What are you talking about, dude?

105
00:10:15.544 --> 00:10:17.319
Seriously, you're gonna play this game with me?

106
00:10:17.406 --> 00:10:18.793
You obviously dig her.

107
00:10:18.824 --> 00:10:19.883
No. No, come on.

108
00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:23.574
Can't you just, like, be chill and not
spazz all over the chicks in our circle?

109
00:10:23.593 --> 00:10:25.639
It always makes things awkward as shit.

110
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:27.159
Yeah, I mean, I don't, like, whatever.

111
00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:29.644
Everyone knows you were
low-key stalking Rachel in college.

112
00:10:29.644 --> 00:10:29.646
Everyone knows you were low-key stalking Rachel in college.
I was not! We were friends.


113
00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:31.928
I was not! We were friends.

114
00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:35.694
Mmkay. And those rumors that you
roofied that freshman our senior year?

115
00:10:35.694 --> 00:10:35.700
Mmkay. And those rumors that you roofied that freshman our senior year?
Oh my god! That never happened!


116
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.344
Oh my god! That never happened!

117
00:10:37.344 --> 00:10:37.353
Oh my god! That never happened!
Why are you bringing up nonsense from a hundred years ago?


118
00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:38.545
Why are you bringing up
nonsense from a hundred years ago?

119
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.288
Busting your tiny balls, man.

120
00:10:41.989 --> 00:10:45.384
Anyway, how's your job or internship thing going?

121
00:10:45.384 --> 00:10:45.391
Anyway, how's your job or internship thing going?
It's a plastics company or something?


122
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:47.294
It's a plastics company or something?

123
00:10:47.294 --> 00:10:47.300
It's a plastics company or something?
Well, that's one of the products they engineer there.


124
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.764
Well, that's one of
the products they engineer there.

125
00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:48.770
Well, that's one of the products they engineer there.
So weird to me that you're an actual chemist.


126
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.603
So weird to me
that you're an actual chemist.

127
00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:51.434
Yeah, I dunno.

128
00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:51.441
Yeah, I dunno.
Always was just good at it.


129
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:53.114
Always was just good at it.

130
00:10:53.114 --> 00:10:53.121
Always was just good at it.
Especially confounding since you're so goddam awful at chemistry with females.


131
00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:57.834
Especially confounding since you're so
goddam awful at chemistry with females.

132
00:10:57.834 --> 00:10:57.841
Especially confounding since you're so goddam awful at chemistry with females.
Dude, shut up!


133
00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:59.274
Dude, shut up!

134
00:10:59.274 --> 00:10:59.277
Dude, shut up!

135
00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:01.955
Just fuckin' wit' you, J-money.

136
00:11:43.422 --> 00:11:44.043
Hey.

You okay?

138
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.564
Who me? Cool as sea cucumber.

139
00:11:48.564 --> 00:11:48.572
Who me? Cool as sea cucumber.
Ok.


140
00:11:48.572 --> 00:11:49.425
Ok.

141
00:11:50.374 --> 00:11:51.490
Everything all right at home?

142
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.919
Yeah, y'know, was just checking in.

143
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.684
That guy still hanging around there?

144
00:11:57.684 --> 00:11:57.692
That guy still hanging around there?
Ok. Yeah, sometimes.


145
00:11:57.692 --> 00:12:00.465
Ok. Yeah, sometimes.

146
00:12:01.227 --> 00:12:05.154
What can I say, my mother
has inordinately shitty taste in men.

147
00:12:05.154 --> 00:12:05.159
What can I say, my mother has inordinately shitty taste in men.
Welcome to the club.


148
00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:06.648
Welcome to the club.

149
00:12:22.568 --> 00:12:24.919
Ok guys, who wants to play a game?

150
00:12:25.307 --> 00:12:26.444
Is it a drinking game?

151
00:12:26.444 --> 00:12:26.450
Is it a drinking game?
I'm already pretty lit, but up for anything.


152
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.244
I'm already pretty lit, but up for anything.

153
00:12:29.244 --> 00:12:29.246
I'm already pretty lit, but up for anything.
It's better than that.


154
00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:30.184
It's better than that.

155
00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:30.191
It's better than that.
A sex game??


156
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:30.984
A sex game??

157
00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:30.991
A sex game??
Ew.


158
00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:31.444
Ew.

159
00:12:31.444 --> 00:12:31.448
Ew.
Like â€˜Eyes Wide Shut,' or butt naked Twister - what's the big deal.


160
00:12:31.448 --> 00:12:35.208
Like â€˜Eyes Wide Shut,' or butt
naked Twister - what's the big deal.

161
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.517
Amongst us, there are two witches,
who have infiltrated our peaceful village.

162
00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:46.210
They are a wicked lot, this dastardly duo.

163
00:12:46.717 --> 00:12:49.534
Each night, when the sun
sets on our 17th century hamlet,

164
00:12:49.534 --> 00:12:49.540
Each night, when the sun sets on our 17th century hamlet,
the witches wake, and take the life of yet another townsperson.


165
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.534
the witches wake, and take
the life of yet another townsperson.

166
00:12:52.534 --> 00:12:52.538
the witches wake, and take the life of yet another townsperson.
Wait, I know this game, we call it mafia, it's where


167
00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.354
Wait, I know this game,
we call it mafia, it's where

168

Wait, I know this game, we call it mafia, it's where
Hold all comments and questions until the end, ye town apothecary tender.


169
00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:57.460
Hold all comments and questions until
the end, ye town apothecary tender.

170
00:12:57.734 --> 00:12:59.474
Always have to be in charge, don't you?

171
00:12:59.474 --> 00:12:59.479
Always have to be in charge, don't you?
Aww, what's a' matter, boo?


172
00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:00.534
Aww, what's a' matter, boo?

173
00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:01.304
Nothing, she

174
00:13:01.304 --> 00:13:01.311
Nothing, she
When I tell you that night has descended,


175
00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:03.284
When I tell you that night has descended,

176
00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:06.304
all you loyal townsfolk will lower
your heads and close your eyes.

177
00:13:06.304 --> 00:13:06.313
all you loyal townsfolk will lower your heads and close your eyes.
And I shall tap the heads of the two witches,


178
00:13:06.313 --> 00:13:08.987
And I shall tap the
heads of the two witches,

179
00:13:09.753 --> 00:13:13.437
who will make eye contact
and silently acknowledge their evil kin.

180
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:18.844
When the sun rises, the townsfolk
shall awake, and begin formulating accusations.

181
00:13:18.844 --> 00:13:18.850
When the sun rises, the townsfolk shall awake, and begin formulating accusations.
Then the accused must defend themselves.


182
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.025
Then the accused must defend themselves.

183
00:13:21.772 --> 00:13:23.774
Once there is a
formal accusation on the floor,

184
00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:23.776
Once there is a formal accusation on the floor,
the accused has thirty seconds to try to save their own neck...


185
00:13:23.776 --> 00:13:26.435
the accused has thirty seconds to
try to save their own neck...

186
00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:27.589
Literally.

187
00:13:35.517 --> 00:13:37.594
I am gonna slay this game.

188
00:13:37.594 --> 00:13:37.597
I am gonna slay this game.
I been killin' the game since â€˜08, yo.


189
00:13:37.597 --> 00:13:39.326
I been killin' the game since â€˜08, yo.

190
00:13:40.564 --> 00:13:41.829
Are there any questions?

191
00:13:42.294 --> 00:13:43.554
Can the witch be a male?

192
00:13:43.554 --> 00:13:43.559
Can the witch be a male?
What kind of an ignorant, antithesis of woke, comment is that?


193
00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:47.124
What kind of an ignorant,
antithesis of woke, comment is that?

194
00:13:47.124 --> 00:13:47.128
What kind of an ignorant, antithesis of woke, comment is that?
Totally un-woke.


195
00:13:47.128 --> 00:13:48.397
Totally un-woke.

196
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.414
Evil takes all forms.

197
00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:50.416
Evil takes all forms.
Of course.


198
00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:51.311
Of course.

199
00:13:51.944 --> 00:13:55.452
And now...night has fallen.

200
00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:58.747
Lower your heads and close those doe-like eyes...

201
00:14:50.248 --> 00:14:51.799
All right, humble villagers,

202
00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:54.622
the sun is breaking over the horizon...

203
00:14:55.254 --> 00:14:57.174
Everyone is coming out of their deep slumbers...

204
00:14:57.658 --> 00:15:00.500
But, alas, there are two interlopers among you.

205
00:15:00.873 --> 00:15:03.711
You must suss them out and burn them
at the stake, if you want to live...

206
00:15:04.065 --> 00:15:04.824
Go.

207
00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:07.194
Francesca is totally a witch!

208
00:15:07.194 --> 00:15:07.201
Francesca is totally a witch!
I am not! You are totally a bitch!


209
00:15:07.201 --> 00:15:09.860
I am not! You are totally a bitch!

210
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.194
On second thought, maybe it's not this THOT.

211
00:15:13.194 --> 00:15:13.201
On second thought, maybe it's not this THOT.
Oh my god, shut up.


212
00:15:13.201 --> 00:15:14.384
Oh my god, shut up.

213
00:15:14.384 --> 00:15:14.389
Oh my god, shut up.
I think it's Ern.


214
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:15.825
I think it's Ern.

215
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.524
It's not me.

216
00:15:17.524 --> 00:15:17.532
It's not me.
How do we know?


217
00:15:17.532 --> 00:15:18.549
How do we know?

218
00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:21.208
Because I'm a terrible
liar, just ask my girlfriend.

219
00:15:21.235 --> 00:15:23.658
Who conveniently isn't here

220
00:15:24.237 --> 00:15:25.109
â€“ you witch!

221
00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:28.111
He's a witch, burn him!

222
00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:29.834
I'm not a witch.

223
00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:29.837
I'm not a witch.
If you kill me, the town loses an innocent person and you all will die.


224
00:15:29.837 --> 00:15:33.494
If you kill me, the town loses
an innocent person and you all will die.

225
00:15:33.494 --> 00:15:35.848
Oh My God kill
this little witch bitch already!

226
00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:40.077
All right, yon town's inhabitants, do we have
a formal accusation on Ern, the village cobbler?

227
00:15:40.401 --> 00:15:41.464
Yes!

228
00:15:41.464 --> 00:15:41.471
Yes!
Cobbler?


229
00:15:41.471 --> 00:15:42.454
Cobbler?

230
00:15:42.454 --> 00:15:44.584
You worked at that
shoe store that one time.

231
00:15:44.584 --> 00:15:45.814
Oh.

232
00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:48.328
Ern. This is your
final chance to defend yourself.

233
00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:52.625
I'm not the witch.

234
00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:55.749
I can not lie. In fact, 
I like big butts,

235
00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:58.142
so I am incapable of lying.

236
00:15:58.462 --> 00:15:59.904
So, yeah. Don't do this.

237
00:15:59.904 --> 00:15:59.905
So, yeah. Don't do this.
You are oozing toxic masculinity right now.


238
00:15:59.905 --> 00:16:02.968
You are oozing toxic masculinity right now.

239
00:16:04.427 --> 00:16:05.768
Haters...gonna hate.

240
00:16:06.134 --> 00:16:07.852
People, what say you?

241
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.736
All who believe Ern stirs eye of
newt into a boiling cauldron, raise your hands.

242
00:16:14.096 --> 00:16:14.793
Opposed?

243
00:16:16.107 --> 00:16:18.275
I don't know why, but I believe him.

244
00:16:19.684 --> 00:16:22.724
All right, Ern...now you burn.

245
00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:26.944
What are - excuse
me - what were you?

246
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:26.949
What are - excuse me - what were you?
I was innocent, you idiots.


247
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:29.404
I was innocent, you idiots.

248
00:16:29.404 --> 00:16:29.406
I was innocent, you idiots.
You all are the village idiots.


249
00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:30.454
You all are the village idiots.

250
00:16:30.454 --> 00:16:32.594
Aww - damn!

251
00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:32.599
Aww - damn!
- I knew it wasn't him - No you didn't - etc.


252
00:16:32.599 --> 00:16:34.564
- I knew it wasn't him 
- No you didn't - etc.

253
00:16:34.564 --> 00:16:37.067
I gotta go anyway, 
I have to pick up my girlfriend from work

254
00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:38.580
Okay, see you later.

255
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.883
I'll see you later.

256
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:42.884
My boy.

257
00:16:45.635 --> 00:16:47.003
I'll see you later.

258
00:16:47.734 --> 00:16:51.754
All right, the sun is
rapidly descending beyond the western hills.

259
00:16:51.754 --> 00:16:51.761
All right, the sun is rapidly descending beyond the western hills.
Townspeople, sleep...


260
00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.894
Townspeople, sleep...

261
00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:02.104
Witches, silently arise â€“ and choose your victim.

262
00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:08.119
All right witches, heads back down...

263
00:17:08.393 --> 00:17:09.631
Mind your pointy hats...

264
00:17:10.443 --> 00:17:11.833
And now... townsfolk...

265
00:17:13.006 --> 00:17:14.264
another dawn has come.

266
00:17:14.964 --> 00:17:18.808
Most of you escaped
the night...but one of you...

267
00:17:19.353 --> 00:17:20.172
Is dead.

268
00:17:21.604 --> 00:17:26.494
It seems a loose wagon wheel has crashed through
your thatched roof home and squashed you in your sleep.

269
00:17:26.494 --> 00:17:26.496
It seems a loose wagon wheel has crashed through your thatched roof home and squashed you in your sleep.
I am sorry...


270
00:17:26.496 --> 00:17:27.624
I am sorry...

271
00:17:27.624 --> 00:17:27.627
I am sorry...
You are dead, Melanie.


272
00:17:27.627 --> 00:17:28.904
You are dead, Melanie.

273
00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:35.353
Oh come on, what the shit!

274
00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:38.248
Reveal your true identity.

275
00:17:38.911 --> 00:17:39.879
I was a townie.

276
00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.456
NOT a witch.

277
00:17:41.776 --> 00:17:46.664
Although now I'm seriously considering becoming a real
witch so I can kill all of you.

278
00:17:46.664 --> 00:17:47.524
That's fair.

279
00:17:47.982 --> 00:17:50.987
And now town folk, try
to find those pesky Wiccans.

280
00:17:53.189 --> 00:17:55.307
This game sucks. 
I hate all of you.

281
00:17:57.509 --> 00:18:02.354
I dunno, yo - why are you
so quiet, um, what is it, Stacey?

282
00:18:02.354 --> 00:18:02.363
I dunno, yo - why are you so quiet, um, what is it, Stacey?
It's Stephanie, you dick, and she's always quiet.


283
00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:05.041
It's Stephanie, you dick, and she's always quiet.

284
00:18:05.414 --> 00:18:06.924
So why are you so
quick to come to defense her?

285
00:18:06.924 --> 00:18:06.930
So why are you so quick to come to defense her?
Because she's my friend, you cockles wonder!


286
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.942
Because she's my friend, you cockles wonder!

287
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.354
You're the damn witch, making a
million accusations and being super aggro

288
00:18:13.354 --> 00:18:13.357
You're the damn witch, making a million accusations and being super aggro
Yes, textbook deflection.


289
00:18:13.357 --> 00:18:15.806
Yes, textbook deflection.

290
00:18:16.206 --> 00:18:18.443
Nice, Brad, thow me under
the bus, like you always do.

291
00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:22.961
I vote Jake is
the witch, who's with me?

292
00:18:24.233 --> 00:18:27.768
Okay, that is one quick, nearly unanimous accusation.

293
00:18:28.096 --> 00:18:31.197
Jake, if ye be witch
or if ye be "l'innocent,"

294
00:18:31.524 --> 00:18:33.174
now ye may defend thyself.

295
00:18:33.174 --> 00:18:33.182
now ye may defend thyself.
Jesus Christ, this is so dumb. I'm not the witch!


296
00:18:33.182 --> 00:18:36.124
Jesus Christ, this is so dumb. 
I'm not the witch!

297
00:18:36.124 --> 00:18:36.126
Jesus Christ, this is so dumb. I'm not the witch!
Oh, so convincing.


298
00:18:36.126 --> 00:18:38.684
Oh, so convincing.

299
00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:38.690
Oh, so convincing.
Fine you know what: It's not me â€“ I peeked and saw who it really was, okay?


300
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.008
Fine you know what: It's not me â€“
I peeked and saw who it really was, okay?

301
00:18:42.717 --> 00:18:43.829
Seriously, you suck.

302
00:18:45.132 --> 00:18:47.004
Okay well you're dead regardless now.

303
00:18:47.004 --> 00:18:47.006
Okay well you're dead regardless now.
Don't reveal what you actually were.


304
00:18:47.006 --> 00:18:48.481
Don't reveal what you actually were.

305
00:18:52.812 --> 00:18:58.271
And now, unsuspecting villagers, the golden orb
of the sun is descending behind the hills

306
00:19:02.248 --> 00:19:03.669
Uh, hey, can I help you?

307
00:19:06.058 --> 00:19:07.521
You most certainly can.

308
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.471
Um, okay...

309
00:19:10.027 --> 00:19:11.604
So, um, wait - who are you?

310
00:19:11.772 --> 00:19:12.736
Uh, you're too nice.

311
00:19:12.881 --> 00:19:15.475
Hey! Were you invited?

312
00:19:16.027 --> 00:19:18.801
No? Then get the
hell out of her house.

313
00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:21.006
Holy shit!!

314
00:19:21.387 --> 00:19:22.694
Hey! She's hurt!

315
00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:22.698
Hey! She's hurt!
Bad. Look.


316
00:19:22.698 --> 00:19:23.104
Bad. Look.

317
00:19:23.104 --> 00:19:23.105
Bad. Look.
Jesus! We need to call her an ambulance


318
00:19:23.105 --> 00:19:25.184
Jesus! We need to call her an ambulance

319
00:19:25.184 --> 00:19:25.185
Jesus! We need to call her an ambulance
Step. Back.


320
00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:26.164
Step. Back.

321
00:19:26.393 --> 00:19:27.794
Listen, you're injured, okay?

322
00:19:27.794 --> 00:19:27.799
Listen, you're injured, okay?
We are going to make sure you get help. Just, let us.


323
00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:30.144
We are going to make sure
you get help. Just, let us.

324
00:19:30.144 --> 00:19:30.149
We are going to make sure you get help. Just, let us.
I am just fine.


325
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:31.353
I am just fine.

326
00:19:31.624 --> 00:19:34.404
You...you are the ones
who are in grave danger.

327
00:19:34.404 --> 00:19:35.898
I'm calling 9-1-1.

328
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.674
Shit. Phone's dead, someone else do it.

329
00:19:39.674 --> 00:19:39.681
Shit. Phone's dead, someone else do it.
Whoa, wait a minute, my shit is out everywhere, just give me a second


330
00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:42.984
Whoa, wait a minute, my shit is
out everywhere, just give me a second

331
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:45.124
What the hell â€“
my phone is dead too.

332
00:19:45.124 --> 00:19:46.824
They're all dead. For now.

333
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.408
What do you mean?

334
00:19:50.865 --> 00:19:53.254
They won't function, for now.

335
00:19:53.254 --> 00:19:53.262
They won't function, for now.
I need to explain something to all of you.


336
00:19:53.262 --> 00:19:54.911
I need to explain
something to all of you.

337
00:19:55.204 --> 00:19:56.416
This is insane.

338
00:19:58.427 --> 00:19:59.524
I'll keep it simple.

339
00:19:59.524 --> 00:20:03.486
I am...not who I appear to be.

340
00:20:04.012 --> 00:20:06.671
I'm just using this corporeal â€˜vessel,'

341
00:20:06.686 --> 00:20:09.147
this body, for a little bit.

342
00:20:09.677 --> 00:20:11.848
Just enough time to deliver
an important message to you.

343
00:20:12.126 --> 00:20:13.936
We're dying of suspense.

344
00:20:14.603 --> 00:20:20.835
There is a man, a very,
very sick man, on his way here.

345
00:20:21.422 --> 00:20:22.530
He is...taking lives.

346
00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:25.997
He took the one of
this person you see before you.

347
00:20:27.566 --> 00:20:29.391
But I am here to offer you

348
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.896
... a deal.

349
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.599
A way out.

350
00:20:33.563 --> 00:20:35.330
A chance to survive.

351
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.044
I don't know what kind of sick
prank this is, you and your geek friends

352
00:20:40.044 --> 00:20:40.046
I don't know what kind of sick prank this is, you and your geek friends
hacked our phones or something for your lame YouTube channel


353
00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:43.324
hacked our phones or something
for your lame YouTube channel

354
00:20:43.324 --> 00:20:43.326
hacked our phones or something for your lame YouTube channel
but I'm outta here.


355
00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:44.972
but I'm outta here.

356
00:20:46.191 --> 00:20:46.904
Wait.

357
00:20:47.902 --> 00:20:48.625
Listen to her.

358
00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:50.926
Let's go, Stephanie.

359
00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:55.658
If you walk out that door, fate
will intervene, and you will instantly die.

360
00:20:56.808 --> 00:20:57.502
Eat me.

361
00:21:14.511 --> 00:21:15.616
AHHHHH!!

362
00:21:18.229 --> 00:21:21.692
Maybe now I actually have your attention.

363
00:21:21.997 --> 00:21:22.994
No fucking way.

364
00:21:22.994 --> 00:21:22.995
No fucking way.
This a fucking folie Ã  cinq?


365
00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:24.625
This a fucking folie Ã  cinq?

366
00:21:24.896 --> 00:21:25.879
Who are you?

367
00:21:27.387 --> 00:21:29.593
I've been given many names over the epochs,

368
00:21:30.484 --> 00:21:32.374
but I think you may already know.

369
00:21:32.785 --> 00:21:33.627
What do you want?

370
00:21:33.848 --> 00:21:35.486
I told you, I'm here to help.

371
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:39.079
This isn't happening...

372
00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:45.494
I need to take six souls
back with me to the...other side

373
00:21:45.494 --> 00:21:45.502
I need to take six souls back with me to the...other side
â€“ well, five now.


374
00:21:45.502 --> 00:21:49.166
â€“ well, five now.

375
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:52.164
It doesn't matter to whom they belong.

376
00:21:52.164 --> 00:21:52.168
It doesn't matter to whom they belong.
So, sorry to be blunt, but what the fuck does that mean?


377
00:21:52.168 --> 00:21:53.985
So, sorry to be blunt, but
what the fuck does that mean?

378
00:21:59.726 --> 00:22:02.340
If you can lure another individual here,

379
00:22:02.473 --> 00:22:07.848
and if you actively take responsibility
in getting them to take your place,

380
00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.951
so to speak, you can
walk out of here alive

381
00:22:10.915 --> 00:22:15.064
â€“ deadline is 4:37 am, by the way.

382
00:22:15.064 --> 00:22:15.071
â€“ deadline is 4:37 am, by the way.
That's when your executioner arrives.


383
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:16.900
That's when your executioner arrives.

384
00:22:17.361 --> 00:22:17.984
On. The. Dot.

385
00:22:17.984 --> 00:22:17.989
On. The. Dot.
So wait, you're saying we have to bring other people here,


386
00:22:17.989 --> 00:22:20.354
So wait, you're saying we
have to bring other people here,

387
00:22:20.354 --> 00:22:20.363
So wait, you're saying we have to bring other people here,
and then, this lunatic will kill them instead of us?


388
00:22:20.363 --> 00:22:22.942
and then, this lunatic will
kill them instead of us?

389
00:22:23.227 --> 00:22:24.587
Not exactly.

390
00:22:24.972 --> 00:22:25.848
She means

391
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.791
that we have to actually kill them.

392
00:22:30.302 --> 00:22:30.964
Right?

393
00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.717
Tit for tat. Yes.

394
00:22:33.094 --> 00:22:34.534
Why would we agree to this?

395
00:22:35.273 --> 00:22:38.594
It's your choice, fully dependent on
how much you value your own life.

396
00:22:38.594 --> 00:22:38.599
It's your choice, fully dependent on how much you value your own life.
"Man is condemned to be free."


397
00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:40.610
"Man is condemned to be free."

398
00:22:41.513 --> 00:22:42.366
Fuck this.

399
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:47.764
Once I resurrect your phones, you
are free to call for help,

400
00:22:47.764 --> 00:22:47.772
Once I resurrect your phones, you are free to call for help,
the police, whomever â€“ but I promise you,


401
00:22:47.772 --> 00:22:49.944
the police, whomever â€“ but I promise you,

402
00:22:49.944 --> 00:22:49.951
the police, whomever â€“ but I promise you,
if you do not take a life in your stead,


403
00:22:49.951 --> 00:22:53.444
if you do not take
a life in your stead,

404
00:22:53.444 --> 00:22:53.448
if you do not take a life in your stead,
then the second you pass through that door, you'll end up just like your friend out there.


405
00:22:53.448 --> 00:22:56.984
then the second you pass through that door,
you'll end up just like your friend out there.

406
00:23:00.256 --> 00:23:03.502
Our father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

407
00:23:03.905 --> 00:23:05.079
I don't want to look at...

408
00:23:07.944 --> 00:23:09.182
Where do you come from?

409
00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:11.742
I have always just...

410
00:23:13.037 --> 00:23:16.084
been a necessary, ultimate
part of the life cycle.

411
00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:19.669
Rachel, you study psychology, correct?

412
00:23:21.963 --> 00:23:23.433
What did Freud say, after all?

413
00:23:26.534 --> 00:23:28.976
â€˜The goal of all life is death.'

414
00:23:29.704 --> 00:23:32.454
But if you are just a...

415
00:23:35.136 --> 00:23:37.338
Why are you doing this, with us?

416
00:23:43.117 --> 00:23:48.408
Everything that has a â€˜life force' of
some sort has wants, desires, an id.

417
00:23:48.759 --> 00:23:50.294
Even the most basic of beings.

418
00:23:50.652 --> 00:23:55.144
I simply want to be entertained. ...
Every eon or so.

419
00:23:56.911 --> 00:24:00.994
You think, say, a virus
has no conscience? No desires?

420
00:24:00.994 --> 00:24:00.999
You think, say, a virus has no conscience? No desires?
If it didn't, then why does it do what it does?


421
00:24:00.999 --> 00:24:02.524
If it didn't, then why
does it do what it does?

422
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:02.526
If it didn't, then why does it do what it does?
Why would it destroy everything in its path,


423
00:24:02.526 --> 00:24:05.804
Why would it destroy everything in its path,

424
00:24:05.804 --> 00:24:05.806
Why would it destroy everything in its path,
with no concern for anything else?


425
00:24:05.806 --> 00:24:08.785
with no concern for anything else?

426
00:24:09.102 --> 00:24:10.176
I have no idea.

427
00:24:11.384 --> 00:24:16.728
Because the virus does have needs. Wants. Desires.

428
00:24:17.403 --> 00:24:18.557
So you're a virus.

429
00:24:19.254 --> 00:24:20.919
No. I am not.

430
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:22.744
A virus can be destroyed.

431
00:24:25.441 --> 00:24:26.138
You know what?

432
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.974
You can go fuck yourself.

433
00:24:28.324 --> 00:24:31.334
You say some maniac is going
to come here and kill us?

434
00:24:31.684 --> 00:24:33.414
Fine, bring it on.

435
00:24:33.795 --> 00:24:35.262
I am not afraid to die.

436
00:24:35.856 --> 00:24:37.883
If that really is true, then
I welcome you to accept your fate.

437
00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:40.888
But I have a sneaking
suspicion that is not the case.

438
00:24:44.439 --> 00:24:45.166
Sweetie,

439
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.787
you appear to be on
good terms with your maker.

440
00:24:50.496 --> 00:24:52.164
If you would truly like to meet him,

441
00:24:52.164 --> 00:24:52.168
If you would truly like to meet him,
well, you have nothing to fear, right?


442
00:24:52.168 --> 00:24:53.684
well, you have nothing to fear, right?

443
00:24:53.684 --> 00:24:53.688
well, you have nothing to fear, right?
If you've lead a righteous life.


444
00:24:53.688 --> 00:24:55.970
If you've lead a righteous life.

445
00:25:03.254 --> 00:25:04.924
There has to be a
logical way out of this.

446
00:25:04.924 --> 00:25:04.926
There has to be a logical way out of this.
Do you actually believe her?


447
00:25:04.926 --> 00:25:06.206
Do you actually believe her?

448
00:25:06.439 --> 00:25:08.284
I don't think we can afford not to.
Don't you?


449
00:25:08.284 --> 00:25:08.290
I don't think we can afford not to.
Don't you?
I mean, look at the wound on her head - she's dead.


450
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.686
I mean, look at the wound
on her head - she's dead.

451
00:25:11.772 --> 00:25:13.128
What are you talking about?

452
00:25:13.955 --> 00:25:15.437
What are we going to do??

453
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.378
It's not fucking all right!

454
00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:19.772
Everyone.

455
00:25:21.189 --> 00:25:22.363
Your phones are back on.

456
00:25:27.448 --> 00:25:29.319
You are free to contact anyone you like.

457
00:25:33.144 --> 00:25:33.940
What are you doing?

458
00:25:36.275 --> 00:25:37.262
I gonna call my mom.

459
00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:40.408
And what? Bring her here? 
What is that going to solve?

460
00:25:50.702 --> 00:25:52.203
This can't be real.

461
00:26:04.934 --> 00:26:07.376
Bradley...come here.

462
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:11.993
Come here!

463
00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:15.208
Come here!

464
00:26:16.797 --> 00:26:20.073
Listen, do you really believe what she said? 
That we can be saved if we...

465
00:26:20.195 --> 00:26:22.954
I'd be a fool to not consider every
option in front of us at this point.

466
00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:22.961
I'd be a fool to not consider every option in front of us at this point.
Okay, okay so how about this option?


467
00:26:22.961 --> 00:26:24.595
Okay, okay so how about this option?

468
00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:26.464
We kill that bitch.

469
00:26:26.464 --> 00:26:26.465
We kill that bitch.
From the looks of that girl, she's not exactly alive.


470
00:26:26.465 --> 00:26:28.804
From the looks of that
girl, she's not exactly alive.

471
00:26:28.804 --> 00:26:28.812
From the looks of that girl, she's not exactly alive.
Well, she's not exactly dead is she?


472
00:26:28.812 --> 00:26:31.071
Well, she's not exactly dead is she?

473
00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:34.218
That is an interesting point you raise.

474
00:26:34.808 --> 00:26:36.324
Look, dude, before we start doing...

475
00:26:36.324 --> 00:26:36.332
Look, dude, before we start doing...
whatever the hell it is we're about to do...why don't we at least "exhaust that option?"


476
00:26:36.332 --> 00:26:41.054
whatever the hell it is we're about to
do...why don't we at least "exhaust that option?"

477
00:26:41.054 --> 00:26:41.060
whatever the hell it is we're about to do...why don't we at least "exhaust that option?"
We need to preserve some goddam equanimity.


478
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.923
We need to preserve some goddam equanimity.

479
00:26:44.424 --> 00:26:46.694
What if that just pisses her off
and she kills us on the spot?

480
00:26:46.694 --> 00:26:46.702
What if that just pisses her off and she kills us on the spot?
Before we start murdering other people, don't you think that's a risk we should take?


481
00:26:46.702 --> 00:26:51.265
Before we start murdering other people, don't
you think that's a risk we should take?

482
00:26:52.252 --> 00:26:53.614
â€˜There are evils worse than death.'

483
00:26:53.614 --> 00:26:53.616
â€˜There are evils worse than death.'
Should we tell the others?


484
00:26:53.616 --> 00:26:55.084
Should we tell the others?

485
00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:55.090
Should we tell the others?
No way. Let's just do this.


486
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.004
No way. Let's just do this.

487
00:26:58.004 --> 00:26:58.008
No way. Let's just do this.
You just distract her, okay?


488
00:26:58.008 --> 00:27:03.048
You just distract her, okay?

489
00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:04.591
Jesus Christ. ...

490
00:27:04.816 --> 00:27:05.444
Okay.

491
00:27:06.229 --> 00:27:07.296
What are you gonna...?

492
00:28:24.572 --> 00:28:25.833
Can I ask you a question?

493
00:28:27.528 --> 00:28:28.679
How old are you?

494
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:33.292
The moment life was created, so was I.

495
00:28:33.844 --> 00:28:34.721
Why?

496
00:28:35.144 --> 00:28:39.505
There is an inherent balance to the universe.

497
00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:41.471
And one more question;

498
00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:46.862
if we each take a soul, then
what happens to the â€˜maniac' or whatever?

499
00:28:48.206 --> 00:28:52.107
He simply will change his course
of action, not even understanding why.

500
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.764
You'll never see him.

501
00:28:54.004 --> 00:28:54.644
Really?

502
00:28:55.494 --> 00:28:56.344
Really.

503
00:29:04.904 --> 00:29:06.378
Uh...sorry

504
00:29:09.273 --> 00:29:10.774
I won't hold it against you.

505
00:29:10.774 --> 00:29:10.782
I won't hold it against you.
But heed my words, each second you waste dilly dallying with me,


506
00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:13.954
But heed my words, each second
you waste dilly dallying with me,

507
00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:13.959
But heed my words, each second you waste dilly dallying with me,
is another second off your rapidly dwindling lifespans.


508
00:29:13.959 --> 00:29:18.523
is another second off your rapidly dwindling lifespans.

509
00:29:21.262 --> 00:29:23.274
Didn't think you would be this predictable.

510
00:29:23.274 --> 00:29:23.281
Didn't think you would be this predictable.
Trying to get me to fall in this way.


511
00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:25.940
Trying to get me
to fall in this way.

512
00:29:26.652 --> 00:29:28.698
â€˜He that dies pays all debts.'

513
00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:32.279
Is that from Game of Thrones?

514
00:29:32.507 --> 00:29:34.309
It's Shakespeare, you idiot.

515
00:29:36.184 --> 00:29:37.185
What happened?

516
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:41.224
Your companions were trying to "cheat death."

517
00:29:41.224 --> 00:29:42.542
Unsuccessfully.

518
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:49.140
I know you are having a difficult time digesting this,
but I assure you, this is the only way out.

519
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:51.330
For reals.

520
00:30:02.199 --> 00:30:04.204
That was really fucking dumb, you two.

521
00:30:04.204 --> 00:30:04.210
That was really fucking dumb, you two.
I'm sorry.


522
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:04.874
I'm sorry.

523
00:30:04.874 --> 00:30:04.877
I'm sorry.
We have to be on the same goddam page here if we're going to figure a way out of this.


524
00:30:04.877 --> 00:30:08.530
We have to be on the same goddam page here
if we're going to figure a way out of this.

525
00:30:09.498 --> 00:30:13.281
There has to be a way for us to, 
I don't know, manipulate these circumstances to our advantage.

526
00:30:14.397 --> 00:30:16.069
Francesca is fucking dead!

527
00:30:16.504 --> 00:30:18.793
That Girl is fucking dead

528
00:30:19.456 --> 00:30:21.734
How are we going to "manipulate" death??

529
00:30:21.734 --> 00:30:21.742
How are we going to "manipulate" death??
There must be a reason why â€˜she,' or it, or whatever that thing is, chose us.


530
00:30:21.742 --> 00:30:26.104
There must be a reason why â€˜she,' or
it, or whatever that thing is, chose us.

531
00:30:26.104 --> 00:30:26.964
That's what I was thinking.

532
00:30:26.964 --> 00:30:26.968
That's what I was thinking.
What does that matter??


533
00:30:26.968 --> 00:30:28.294
What does that matter??

534
00:30:28.896 --> 00:30:31.406
Oh my god we're going to fucking die!

535
00:30:31.582 --> 00:30:33.460
We are NOT going to die.

536
00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:35.349
Well, I sure as shit don't want to.

537
00:30:36.145 --> 00:30:38.864
I don't care; I'm not going down without a fight. 
I am going to survive.

538
00:30:38.864 --> 00:30:38.865
I don't care; I'm not going down without a fight. I am going to survive.
Same here.


539
00:30:38.865 --> 00:30:40.290
Same here.

540
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.723
What if we...I know this sounds...

541
00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:47.353
but what if we could
do some good with this?

542
00:30:47.864 --> 00:30:49.474
Good?? Are you mental?

543
00:30:49.474 --> 00:30:49.483
Good?? Are you mental?
I mean, like, look... All she wants is for us to get some â€˜souls' here...


544
00:30:49.483 --> 00:30:54.254
I mean, like, look... 
All she wants is for us to get some â€˜souls' here...

545
00:30:54.254 --> 00:30:54.256
I mean, like, look... All she wants is for us to get some â€˜souls' here...
What if we brought some that...


546
00:30:54.256 --> 00:30:58.124
What if we brought some that...

547
00:30:58.124 --> 00:30:58.130
What if we brought some that...
that would make the world a better place if they were...gone.


548
00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:01.064
that would make the world
a better place if they were...gone.

549
00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:04.374
Yeah, I see what you mean.

550
00:31:04.728 --> 00:31:06.534
There are some shitty people that, yeah,

551
00:31:06.534 --> 00:31:06.542
There are some shitty people that, yeah,
maybe best be suited not inflicting pain on others...


552
00:31:06.542 --> 00:31:09.121
maybe best be suited
not inflicting pain on others...

553
00:31:09.288 --> 00:31:10.584
Are you being serious?

554
00:31:10.584 --> 00:31:10.591
Are you being serious?
Well, just think about it


555
00:31:10.591 --> 00:31:11.564
Well, just think about it

556
00:31:11.564 --> 00:31:11.570
Well, just think about it
I don't wanna think about it because it's SICK!


557
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.264
I don't wanna think
about it because it's SICK!

558
00:31:14.264 --> 00:31:14.271
I don't wanna think about it because it's SICK!
Wait.


559
00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:15.582
Wait.

560
00:31:16.926 --> 00:31:18.332
You guys have a point.

561
00:31:19.319 --> 00:31:24.656
If, just hypothetically, we were to eliminate
people that are causing real harm to others

562
00:31:25.185 --> 00:31:29.711
- and we devoted the absolute rest of
our lives to helping other people, to doing good

563
00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:35.003
- I think, morally, we would actually
come out on the right side of this.

564
00:31:35.521 --> 00:31:37.444
That's moral relativism, right there.

565
00:31:37.444 --> 00:31:37.448
That's moral relativism, right there.
Nietzsche at his finest.


566
00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:38.690
Nietzsche at his finest.

567
00:31:39.044 --> 00:31:42.412
Which, don't forget, he bit from Protagoras,
"Man is the measure of all things."

568
00:31:46.408 --> 00:31:46.945
Kids.

569
00:31:48.123 --> 00:31:49.547
The clock is ticking.

570
00:32:00.534 --> 00:32:01.273
Just say it.

571
00:32:01.787 --> 00:32:03.104
My mom's boyfriend.

572
00:32:03.104 --> 00:32:03.113
My mom's boyfriend.
Of course.


573
00:32:03.113 --> 00:32:03.829
Of course.

574
00:32:04.164 --> 00:32:04.594
"Hank."

575
00:32:04.594 --> 00:32:04.603
"Hank."
Yeah.


576
00:32:04.603 --> 00:32:05.064
Yeah.

577
00:32:05.064 --> 00:32:05.071
Yeah.
...What's his deal, Brad?


578
00:32:05.071 --> 00:32:06.050
...What's his deal, Brad?

579
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.081
He...

580
00:32:09.414 --> 00:32:10.473
He's hurt my mother.

581
00:32:10.747 --> 00:32:11.932
My brother, too.

582
00:32:12.698 --> 00:32:13.894
What a piece of shit.

583
00:32:14.481 --> 00:32:17.395
I'd be lying if I said
I haven't fantasized about this before.

584
00:32:18.317 --> 00:32:22.458
I just, I always try to be
around when he is there, to protect them,

585
00:32:23.151 --> 00:32:25.673
but sometimes... 
Sometimes I can't.

586
00:32:27.003 --> 00:32:29.109
Well fuck it, that's
all I need to hear.

587
00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:30.465
Get him here.

588
00:32:31.403 --> 00:32:32.774
I don't know what to say though.

589
00:32:33.342 --> 00:32:35.079
We're not exactly on speaking terms.

590
00:32:35.288 --> 00:32:36.603
It's gonna be weird as shit.

591
00:32:36.785 --> 00:32:38.717
What's he into?

592
00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:39.754
What do you mean?

593
00:32:39.754 --> 00:32:39.757
What do you mean?
I mean, what will entice him?


594
00:32:39.757 --> 00:32:43.904
I mean, what will entice him?

595
00:32:43.904 --> 00:32:43.905
I mean, what will entice him?
Get him over here.


596
00:32:43.905 --> 00:32:45.060
Get him over here.

597
00:32:45.978 --> 00:32:49.254
He's a scumbag, a complete degenerate. a philistine.

598
00:32:49.254 --> 00:32:49.258
He's a scumbag, a complete degenerate. a philistine.
All he cares about is gambling, money...


599
00:32:49.258 --> 00:32:52.254
All he cares about is gambling, money...

600
00:32:52.254 --> 00:32:52.260
All he cares about is gambling, money...
Call him and tell him we have a high stakes poker game here.


601
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.414
Call him and tell him we
have a high stakes poker game here.

602
00:32:57.414 --> 00:32:59.904
And the players suck,
so he'll win, or something.

603
00:32:59.904 --> 00:32:59.905
And the players suck, so he'll win, or something.
I dunno...


604
00:32:59.905 --> 00:33:00.458
I dunno...

605
00:33:00.884 --> 00:33:03.974
No. There has to be a
reason why YOU would call him.

606
00:33:03.974 --> 00:33:03.978
No. There has to be a reason why YOU would call him.
Precisely.


607
00:33:03.978 --> 00:33:04.892
Precisely.

608
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:11.052
How about, you were partying here,
and you found my parents' safe.

609
00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:15.154
It's too heavy to transport on your own-and
since you got a ride here from Melanie,

610
00:33:15.154 --> 00:33:15.163
It's too heavy to transport on your own-and since you got a ride here from Melanie,
you need his car, too.


611
00:33:15.163 --> 00:33:16.804
you need his car, too.

612
00:33:17.212 --> 00:33:18.081
Shit.

613
00:33:18.877 --> 00:33:19.684
That's not bad.

614
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:21.368
That's good, Rach.

615
00:33:22.366 --> 00:33:24.130
Looks like you have
a knack for this, too.

616
00:33:26.096 --> 00:33:29.216
Okay. Do it. Call him.

617
00:33:45.536 --> 00:33:48.782
Uh, Hank, can I talk
to you for a minute?

618
00:33:50.313 --> 00:33:51.665
Yeah...Ok...

619
00:33:52.123 --> 00:33:53.284
Take your time...

620
00:33:56.904 --> 00:34:00.210
Uh, I didn't really know
who to ask about this, but...

621
00:34:01.003 --> 00:34:02.538
I'm at somebody's house,

622
00:34:03.155 --> 00:34:04.218
a party

623
00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:06.100
â€“ it's this rich kid's place

624
00:34:06.534 --> 00:34:07.608
- found a safe here.

625
00:34:07.993 --> 00:34:09.136
I know it's got cash in it...

626
00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:13.334
But it's too heavy for me to take
on my own, and I can't get it open,

627
00:34:14.683 --> 00:34:17.841
Yeah, I got a ride...

628
00:34:19.624 --> 00:34:23.772
So, I found a way to bring
it through the back without anyone seeing me...

629
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.182
Can you help me?

630
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.001
We can open it, split the...

631
00:34:29.387 --> 00:34:31.696
I'm serious. Dead ass. ...

632
00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:35.509
Ok...yeah, I can text you the address.

633
00:34:37.418 --> 00:34:38.584
Thanks, man.

634
00:34:42.237 --> 00:34:43.376
He's coming.

635
00:34:45.913 --> 00:34:46.686
Okay.

636
00:34:47.883 --> 00:34:51.345
So now what, should we start another or...?

637
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:52.824
It's almost one-forty five.

638
00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:52.827
It's almost one-forty five.
Let's not complicate things.


639
00:34:52.827 --> 00:34:53.854
Let's not complicate things.

640
00:34:53.854 --> 00:34:53.860
Let's not complicate things.
Let's get this done first.


641
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.433
Let's get this done first.

642
00:34:55.646 --> 00:34:56.763
Bradley â€“ are you ready?

643
00:34:58.881 --> 00:34:59.978
He's a piece of shit.

644
00:35:00.679 --> 00:35:04.218
If he hurt your mother,
your little brother, he deserves this.

645
00:35:05.185 --> 00:35:05.886
Trust me.

646
00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:07.985
The world is way better without him.

647
00:35:08.454 --> 00:35:09.452
It's gonna have to be.

648
00:35:13.684 --> 00:35:15.033
Alright, so...

649
00:35:16.024 --> 00:35:20.234
So what's the plan? Poker again?

650
00:35:20.234 --> 00:35:20.237
So what's the plan? Poker again?
No.


651
00:35:20.237 --> 00:35:20.801
No.

652
00:35:21.151 --> 00:35:24.359
He's a big dude. 
Need something bigger to take him down.

653
00:35:24.824 --> 00:35:27.547
Rach, do you have any... weapons here?

654
00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:30.804
My brother played baseball.

655
00:35:30.804 --> 00:35:33.441
There are still bats in his room. 
Would that?...

656
00:35:33.684 --> 00:35:34.957
If I hit him hard enough.

657
00:35:36.709 --> 00:35:40.656
Shit. We have to
get Francesca off the porch.

658
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:50.210
Can we pull her in, without, y'know...

659
00:35:51.448 --> 00:35:54.770
Yes. Of course. 
You can put your hand out the doorway...just don't cross the threshold.

660
00:36:00.854 --> 00:36:02.439
Let's go get her...

661
00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:30.054
My lord, guide me.

662
00:36:41.902 --> 00:36:43.909
Uh, hey kids, what's shakin'?

663
00:36:45.574 --> 00:36:47.060
You guys seen Brad?

664
00:36:48.134 --> 00:36:50.264
What the fuck, boy??

665
00:36:50.264 --> 00:36:50.271
What the fuck, boy??
I...am...gonna...beat your ass boy...


666
00:36:50.271 --> 00:36:52.434
I...am...gonna...beat your ass boy...

667
00:36:52.434 --> 00:36:52.439
I...am...gonna...beat your ass boy...
Ah! Fuck!


668
00:36:52.439 --> 00:36:53.704
Ah! Fuck!

669
00:36:53.704 --> 00:36:53.711
Ah! Fuck!
Help!


670
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:54.328
Help!

671
00:36:55.795 --> 00:36:56.808
You little cunts!

672
00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:01.951
Do it!

673
00:37:03.665 --> 00:37:04.309
No!

674
00:37:12.134 --> 00:37:13.323
AAHHHH!

675
00:37:16.161 --> 00:37:17.444
Aahhh!

676
00:37:17.444 --> 00:37:20.427
Listen, I need you to calm down.

677
00:37:20.964 --> 00:37:22.606
I don't want the neighbors to hear
any more screaming over here than necessary.

678
00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:23.874
What if they get curious and come over?

679
00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:23.879
What if they get curious and come over?
What then?


680
00:37:23.879 --> 00:37:24.420
What then?

681
00:37:34.637 --> 00:37:35.742
Good team work.

682
00:37:35.978 --> 00:37:37.052
All of you.

683
00:37:37.593 --> 00:37:38.900
You really came through.

684
00:37:39.513 --> 00:37:40.759
Especially Bradley.

685
00:37:42.401 --> 00:37:42.984
So...

686
00:38:53.582 --> 00:38:57.448
Remember, the first is always the hardest.

687
00:38:57.688 --> 00:38:59.235
The ice-breaker.

688
00:39:00.195 --> 00:39:01.620
Keep the momentum going.

689
00:39:02.424 --> 00:39:03.772
I'm going for a walk.

690
00:39:05.018 --> 00:39:06.488
Why do you talk like that?

691
00:39:07.086 --> 00:39:07.624
Pardon?

692
00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:08.812
Like that?

693
00:39:09.761 --> 00:39:10.789
Very different...

694
00:39:12.321 --> 00:39:19.604
I've heard every tongue ever spoken,
every word, every cuss, and colloquialism

695
00:39:21.406 --> 00:39:22.416
See you later, hunty.

696
00:39:27.124 --> 00:39:28.759
I hate to say it,
but the bitch is right.

697
00:39:28.984 --> 00:39:29.799
You mean?

698
00:39:30.561 --> 00:39:31.824
About â€˜momentum.'

699
00:39:31.824 --> 00:39:31.825
About â€˜momentum.'
Yes.


700
00:39:31.825 --> 00:39:32.420
Yes.

701
00:39:32.892 --> 00:39:34.309
So who else?

702
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.624
I can't think of...

703
00:39:35.624 --> 00:39:35.627
I can't think of...
Come on, there has to be more people that would be better off...


704
00:39:35.627 --> 00:39:38.704
Come on, there has to be
more people that would be better off...

705
00:39:38.704 --> 00:39:38.713
Come on, there has to be more people that would be better off...
Wait. Stephanie.


706
00:39:38.713 --> 00:39:39.871
Wait. Stephanie.

707
00:39:40.092 --> 00:39:42.789
You worked with Francesca at Westhedge, right?

708
00:39:43.985 --> 00:39:45.273
Yeah, that's where we...

709
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:50.519
Well, think. There has to be some
people there that actually want to die.

710
00:39:51.544 --> 00:39:52.317
Sweet plan.

711
00:39:54.942 --> 00:39:57.224
Jesus, Rachel, you're supposed
to be the smart one.

712
00:39:57.224 --> 00:39:57.984
Shut up, Jake.

713
00:39:57.984 --> 00:39:57.985
Shut up, Jake.
Yeah, but wait a second - maybe there is another worker there


714
00:39:57.985 --> 00:39:59.934
Yeah, but wait a second -
maybe there is another worker there

715
00:39:59.934 --> 00:39:59.936
Yeah, but wait a second - maybe there is another worker there
- a nurse, or, I dunno, a guard there that you're friends with,


716
00:39:59.936 --> 00:40:01.154
- a nurse, or, 
I dunno, a guard there that you're friends with,

717
00:40:01.154 --> 00:40:01.163
- a nurse, or, I dunno, a guard there that you're friends with,
or has a crush on you, that could smuggle someone out.


718
00:40:01.163 --> 00:40:03.159
or has a crush on
you, that could smuggle someone out.

719
00:40:03.784 --> 00:40:07.471
...I don't know. 
I really only am friendly with Francesca there...

720
00:40:09.132 --> 00:40:10.393
What's the matter, Stephanie?

721
00:40:11.231 --> 00:40:13.517
You're being weird...er.

722
00:40:16.904 --> 00:40:18.873
Fine, whatever. 
No old people then.

723
00:40:43.806 --> 00:40:45.314
What are you doing?

724
00:40:45.314 --> 00:40:45.319
What are you doing?
I think I left my phone there.


725
00:40:45.319 --> 00:40:46.854
I think I left my phone there.

726
00:40:46.854 --> 00:40:48.161
Seriously??

727
00:41:12.359 --> 00:41:13.784
Guys, come ON.

728
00:41:13.784 --> 00:41:13.791
Guys, come ON.
There are so many shitty twats in the world.


729
00:41:13.791 --> 00:41:15.904
There are so many
shitty twats in the world.

730
00:41:15.904 --> 00:41:15.913
There are so many shitty twats in the world.
This should not be that hard.


731
00:41:15.913 --> 00:41:17.514
This should not be that hard.

732
00:41:17.514 --> 00:41:17.521
This should not be that hard.
There's just not a lot off the top of my head, who I personally know.


733
00:41:17.521 --> 00:41:21.094
There's just not a lot off the
top of my head, who I personally know.

734
00:41:21.094 --> 00:41:21.102
There's just not a lot off the top of my head, who I personally know.
But, what about your dealer?


735
00:41:21.102 --> 00:41:22.554
But, what about your dealer?

736
00:41:22.554 --> 00:41:22.557
But, what about your dealer?
Frisco?


737
00:41:22.557 --> 00:41:23.654
Frisco?

738
00:41:23.654 --> 00:41:23.658
Frisco?
Yeah.


739
00:41:23.658 --> 00:41:24.184
Yeah.

740
00:41:24.184 --> 00:41:25.231
Are you serious?

741
00:41:26.363 --> 00:41:27.982
He's the best - no way.

742
00:41:28.401 --> 00:41:28.974
Wait.

743
00:41:28.974 --> 00:41:28.976
Wait.
Another idea?


744
00:41:28.976 --> 00:41:31.052
Another idea?

745
00:41:31.315 --> 00:41:33.144
What if it's someone we don't directly know.

746
00:41:33.505 --> 00:41:34.180
Yes.

747
00:41:34.584 --> 00:41:36.974
There has to be a
way to lure someone "bad" here.

748
00:41:36.974 --> 00:41:36.980
There has to be a way to lure someone "bad" here.
Someone we indirectly know.


749
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.314
Someone we indirectly know.

750
00:41:38.314 --> 00:41:38.317
Someone we indirectly know.
Someone who's close enough...


751
00:41:38.317 --> 00:41:38.994
Someone who's close enough...

752
00:41:38.994 --> 00:41:38.999
Someone who's close enough...
Holy shit! You're a genius.


753
00:41:38.999 --> 00:41:41.074
Holy shit! You're a genius.

754
00:41:41.074 --> 00:41:41.079
Holy shit! You're a genius.
What?


755
00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:41.627
What?

756
00:41:42.862 --> 00:41:43.484
Maestro.

757
00:41:43.484 --> 00:41:43.490
Maestro.
Yes.


758
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.884
Yes.

759
00:41:43.884 --> 00:41:43.886
Yes.
That politician perv?


760
00:41:43.886 --> 00:41:45.874
That politician perv?

761
00:41:45.874 --> 00:41:45.875
That politician perv?
Mm-hmm.


762
00:41:45.875 --> 00:41:46.424
Mm-hmm.

763
00:41:46.424 --> 00:41:46.427
Mm-hmm.
We just have the lay the right bait. He'll come.


764
00:41:46.427 --> 00:41:48.397
We just have the lay
the right bait. He'll come.

765
00:41:48.827 --> 00:41:50.864
What, you have his number or something?

766
00:41:50.864 --> 00:41:50.869
What, you have his number or something?
Don't need it - thank you, internet.


767
00:41:50.869 --> 00:41:52.591
Don't need it - thank you, internet.

768
00:41:53.292 --> 00:41:56.538
Exactly. We can just tweet
at his filthy old ass.

769
00:41:57.105 --> 00:41:58.420
So who's gonna do it?

770
00:41:58.789 --> 00:41:59.864
It has to be believable

771
00:41:59.864 --> 00:41:59.867
It has to be believable
And not sus at all.


772
00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:00.874
And not sus at all.

773
00:42:00.874 --> 00:42:00.881
And not sus at all.
Let's not overthink this.


774
00:42:00.881 --> 00:42:02.794
Let's not overthink this.

775
00:42:02.794 --> 00:42:02.801
Let's not overthink this.
Who's got the most enticing Instagram?


776
00:42:02.801 --> 00:42:04.363
Who's got the most enticing Instagram?

777
00:42:06.172 --> 00:42:07.947
Okay, okay. I'll do it.

778
00:42:08.606 --> 00:42:10.923
I'll like some of
his pics and follow him.

779
00:42:11.231 --> 00:42:12.654
Melanie, don't take this the wrong way;

780
00:42:12.654 --> 00:42:12.656
Melanie, don't take this the wrong way;
you're obviously hot and your pics are â€˜lit'


781
00:42:12.656 --> 00:42:14.504
you're obviously hot and your pics are â€˜lit'

782
00:42:14.504 --> 00:42:14.511
you're obviously hot and your pics are â€˜lit'
â€“ but I don't think you're his type.


783
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:16.530
â€“ but I don't think you're his type.

784
00:42:16.824 --> 00:42:18.034
Oh, you mean...

785
00:42:18.034 --> 00:42:18.039
Oh, you mean...
Yeah. This dude is into young girls.


786
00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:20.374
Yeah. This dude is into young girls.

787
00:42:20.374 --> 00:42:20.382
Yeah. This dude is into young girls.
Innocent looking ones.


788
00:42:20.382 --> 00:42:21.934
Innocent looking ones.

789
00:42:21.934 --> 00:42:21.936
Innocent looking ones.
Okay, so?...


790
00:42:21.936 --> 00:42:24.314
Okay, so?...

791
00:42:24.314 --> 00:42:24.321
Okay, so?...
Stephanie, do you have an account?


792
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:26.164
Stephanie, do you have an account?

793
00:42:27.966 --> 00:42:28.907
Can I see?

794
00:42:43.601 --> 00:42:46.298
Oh, damn... This is perfect.

795
00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:48.012
Do you mind if I?...

796
00:42:55.833 --> 00:42:56.610
...And ..sent.

797
00:42:57.658 --> 00:42:58.458
Okay.

798
00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:06.004
Bingo.

799
00:43:06.999 --> 00:43:08.858
What? He followed you back

800
00:43:09.193 --> 00:43:10.363
He just sent me a message.

801
00:43:11.052 --> 00:43:11.964
For real?

802
00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:11.966
For real?
He literally just gave her a "'Sup cutie?" DM.


803
00:43:11.966 --> 00:43:15.554
He literally just gave her a "'
Sup cutie?" DM.

804
00:43:15.554 --> 00:43:15.563
He literally just gave her a "'Sup cutie?" DM.
Is this guy legit?


805
00:43:15.563 --> 00:43:16.704
Is this guy legit?

806
00:43:16.704 --> 00:43:16.709
Is this guy legit?
Like, that easy?


807
00:43:16.709 --> 00:43:17.985
Like, that easy?

808
00:43:18.469 --> 00:43:19.114
Yeah, wait...

809
00:43:19.114 --> 00:43:19.121
Yeah, wait...
He's being investigated for a litany of sexual misconduct charges


810
00:43:19.121 --> 00:43:21.944
He's being investigated for a
litany of sexual misconduct charges

811
00:43:21.944 --> 00:43:21.951
He's being investigated for a litany of sexual misconduct charges
and he takes the bait, just like that?


812
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:23.464
and he takes the bait, just like that?

813
00:43:23.902 --> 00:43:25.504
Do you think this
is some sort of trap?

814
00:43:25.504 --> 00:43:25.509
Do you think this is some sort of trap?
I think men are just inherently fucktards when it comes to anything related to their dicks.


815
00:43:25.509 --> 00:43:30.328
I think men are just inherently fucktards when
it comes to anything related to their dicks.

816
00:43:30.656 --> 00:43:31.818
Sounds about right, actually.

817
00:43:34.732 --> 00:43:35.964
What are you telling him?

818
00:43:35.964 --> 00:43:35.966
What are you telling him?
I'm just saying I saw him around..


819
00:43:35.966 --> 00:43:38.264
I'm just saying I saw him around..

820
00:43:38.264 --> 00:43:42.004
figured â€˜what the heck...wanted to see if he'd
like to come to our party and hang.'

821
00:43:42.004 --> 00:43:42.012
figured â€˜what the heck...wanted to see if he'd like to come to our party and hang.'
Yeah, that's good, make it seem casual.


822
00:43:42.012 --> 00:43:44.382
Yeah, that's good, make it seem casual.

823
00:43:44.404 --> 00:43:50.366
But what if he gets suspicious about the
â€˜party,' maybe he'd want to meet her alone instead?

824
00:43:50.953 --> 00:43:51.582
Sent.

825
00:43:52.641 --> 00:43:54.484
We'll find out soon enough
what this pedo is into.

826
00:43:54.778 --> 00:43:56.424
You've invited another guest?

827
00:43:56.424 --> 00:43:56.431
You've invited another guest?
Yup. The party don't stop here.


828
00:43:56.431 --> 00:43:58.424
Yup. The party don't stop here.

829
00:43:59.528 --> 00:44:04.092
This person you've extended your hospitality to...

830
00:44:04.542 --> 00:44:05.730
He is a dangerous man.

831
00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.594
Be careful in how you approach this.

832
00:44:08.594 --> 00:44:08.595
Be careful in how you approach this.
Wow, you are SO fucking nice to be worried about us.


833
00:44:08.595 --> 00:44:12.096
Wow, you are SO fucking
nice to be worried about us.

834
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.684
I just want to see you
accomplish your tasks, that is all.

835
00:44:16.446 --> 00:44:17.532
I'll leave you to it.

836
00:44:26.553 --> 00:44:28.043
"What's the addy?"

837
00:44:28.283 --> 00:44:30.648
â€“ Is this guy serious? 
He's like fifty.

838
00:44:31.262 --> 00:44:32.225
I got it.

839
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:39.904
He obviously has some delusions
about appearing youthful or whatever.

840
00:44:39.904 --> 00:44:39.913
He obviously has some delusions about appearing youthful or whatever.
Predators like that either identify with their prey, or know exactly how to manipulate the naive.


841
00:44:39.913 --> 00:44:45.269
Predators like that either identify with their prey,
or know exactly how to manipulate the naive.

842
00:44:47.444 --> 00:44:49.982
Well his sick old ass
is getting manipulated right here.

843
00:44:52.214 --> 00:44:53.094
"Omw."

844
00:44:54.123 --> 00:44:54.884
Okay

845
00:44:57.433 --> 00:44:58.603
so... Who's doing him?

846
00:45:00.187 --> 00:45:04.454
You are all able to help one
another, in fact, the more the merrier,

847
00:45:05.231 --> 00:45:08.961
but one person must
actually take their replacement's soul.

848
00:45:09.189 --> 00:45:10.568
We got it.

849
00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:19.429
Just keep it simple.

850
00:45:20.686 --> 00:45:21.711
Who hates him the most?

851
00:45:21.742 --> 00:45:23.704
I think he's a vile piece of garbage.

852
00:45:23.704 --> 00:45:24.484
I can do it.

853
00:45:24.484 --> 00:45:24.488
I can do it.
No. I actually want to do it.


854
00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:27.833
No. I actually want to do it.

855
00:45:34.408 --> 00:45:35.304
Can't wait..

856
00:45:36.572 --> 00:45:37.601
He said ten minutes.

857
00:45:38.107 --> 00:45:41.474
All right, so what's the plan of attack?

858
00:45:41.474 --> 00:45:41.483
All right, so what's the plan of attack?
The bat, we still have the poker, um...


859
00:45:41.483 --> 00:45:43.471
The bat, we still have the poker, um...

860
00:45:43.669 --> 00:45:44.553
Knives.

861
00:45:46.313 --> 00:45:47.559
Are you ok, Melanie?

862
00:45:49.357 --> 00:45:50.694
I'm downright dandy.

863
00:45:51.745 --> 00:45:53.704
So, knives?

864
00:45:54.698 --> 00:45:55.684
Kitchen.

865
00:45:57.307 --> 00:45:59.264
You think something happened to her, before, that

866
00:45:59.264 --> 00:45:59.273
You think something happened to her, before, that
Shh. Shut up, Jake.


867
00:45:59.273 --> 00:46:00.504
Shh. Shut up, Jake.

868
00:46:01.452 --> 00:46:03.144
You used to value my opinion, Rachel.

869
00:46:03.144 --> 00:46:03.147
You used to value my opinion, Rachel.
Huh?


870
00:46:03.147 --> 00:46:03.837
Huh?

871
00:46:05.239 --> 00:46:07.024
You really have a selective memory, don't you?

872
00:46:07.024 --> 00:46:07.025
You really have a selective memory, don't you?
Guys, please, let's focus.


873
00:46:07.025 --> 00:46:09.696
Guys, please, let's focus.

874
00:46:10.477 --> 00:46:11.292
Stephanie.

875
00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:12.854
Stephanie.

876
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:14.797
Head in the game, girl.

877
00:46:57.715 --> 00:47:00.374
Get in the exact same positions as before.

878
00:47:00.686 --> 00:47:04.043
Rachel, you can message him once
he's here, lead him where to go.

879
00:47:04.625 --> 00:47:06.584
I'm getting in this closet.

880
00:47:07.056 --> 00:47:09.475
Once he comes out and
I'll take care of it.

881
00:47:09.692 --> 00:47:10.816
â€˜Take care of it?'

882
00:47:11.086 --> 00:47:12.862
I'll stab the pedophile in his back.

883
00:47:13.147 --> 00:47:13.654
Okay?

884
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:15.311
Ah!

885
00:47:26.241 --> 00:47:27.044
Apologies.

886
00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:29.631
I just want to tell you
all how wonderful you are doing.

887
00:47:30.987 --> 00:47:31.665
Good luck.

888
00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:50.564
Hey,

889
00:47:52.907 --> 00:47:53.726
nice digs.

890
00:47:55.387 --> 00:47:57.677
Hey, what's up, man?

891
00:47:57.854 --> 00:48:03.902
Nothin', just chillin'. 
Where's, uh.. â€˜Steph' at?

892
00:48:07.102 --> 00:48:08.599
Hi, it's me.

893
00:48:09.117 --> 00:48:10.020
Glad you came.

894
00:48:12.366 --> 00:48:13.437
My pleasure.

895
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.591
AArrrghhh!

896
00:48:16.705 --> 00:48:18.111
What the fuck?

897
00:48:21.787 --> 00:48:22.854
You wanna fuck with me?

898
00:48:23.345 --> 00:48:24.954
You don't know who you're fucking with!

899
00:48:24.954 --> 00:48:24.961
You don't know who you're fucking with!
No!


900
00:48:24.961 --> 00:48:25.875
No!

901
00:48:29.966 --> 00:48:30.717
Graahh!

902
00:48:34.667 --> 00:48:36.241
WWAAARRGGGHHH!

903
00:49:07.612 --> 00:49:09.208
Maybe now you'll go out with me?

904
00:49:11.288 --> 00:49:12.755
You'll be okay, Jake,

905
00:49:13.601 --> 00:49:15.620
we're going to get you to the hospital.

906
00:49:19.048 --> 00:49:20.549
That's not... how...this works...

907
00:49:44.759 --> 00:49:46.321
That was...breathtaking.

908
00:49:46.896 --> 00:49:48.225
I am so, SO proud of you, all.

909
00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:49.864
Especially you, Stephanie.

910
00:49:49.864 --> 00:49:53.963
You really reconnected there with something, hmm?

911
00:49:57.121 --> 00:49:59.404
I am sorry about your
friend, though. Truly, I am.

912
00:49:59.404 --> 00:49:59.410
I am sorry about your friend, though. Truly, I am.
He did die valiantly, though.


913
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:00.801
He did die valiantly, though.

914
00:50:03.364 --> 00:50:04.675
Holy fuck.

915
00:50:06.576 --> 00:50:07.883
I get this now.

916
00:50:13.551 --> 00:50:16.404
You're not making us do
this because you're just "bored,"

917
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.044
or want to be "entertained," you're doing this

918
00:50:19.044 --> 00:50:19.048
or want to be "entertained," you're doing this
I'm not making you do anything,


919
00:50:19.048 --> 00:50:22.458
I'm not making you do anything,

920
00:50:24.027 --> 00:50:25.978
if you recall. Free will.

921
00:50:26.195 --> 00:50:29.905
One of the many joys of being human.

922
00:50:30.302 --> 00:50:32.229
You know what I mean you dead bitch.

923
00:50:32.865 --> 00:50:35.254
You chose us, the six of us,

924
00:50:35.254 --> 00:50:37.277
because we all have something in our past...

925
00:50:37.848 --> 00:50:39.075
something dark..

926
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.010
What do you mean?

927
00:50:41.646 --> 00:50:43.284
Did you hear what
she just said to Stephanie

928
00:50:43.284 --> 00:50:44.717
â€“ about "reconnecting"

929
00:50:46.107 --> 00:50:47.323
â€“ what's that mean, Stephanie?

930
00:50:50.412 --> 00:50:52.126
You're a born-again Christian, right?

931
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.052
...You could say that.

932
00:50:55.239 --> 00:50:58.462
So what did you leave behind
â€“ what part of you "died?"

933
00:50:59.696 --> 00:51:00.987
I don't know what you mean.

934
00:51:01.604 --> 00:51:03.536
Who were you, Stephanie?

935
00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.467
I love when you come over.

936
00:51:14.904 --> 00:51:16.126
I love coming, Harmony.

937
00:52:07.037 --> 00:52:08.384
I want you to choke me.

938
00:52:08.384 --> 00:52:08.389
I want you to choke me.
Mmm...Really?


939
00:52:08.389 --> 00:52:09.791
Mmm...Really?

940
00:52:09.989 --> 00:52:11.810
Yeah, babe, come on.

941
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:33.673
Harder.

942
00:53:35.711 --> 00:53:37.323
I just left her there.

943
00:53:39.292 --> 00:53:40.652
Jesus, Stephanie.

944
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:42.145
I'm sorry.

945
00:53:42.584 --> 00:53:44.553
That doesn't sound like it
was your fault at all.

946
00:53:45.844 --> 00:53:47.616
Well, I didn't get caught.

947
00:53:48.686 --> 00:53:51.364
I had already been in juvie and
had a lot of things on my record...

948
00:53:51.947 --> 00:53:54.938
But the police thought it
was just another kid OD-ing.

949
00:53:55.886 --> 00:53:57.197
You did what you had to.

950
00:53:58.587 --> 00:53:59.772
After that, I...

951
00:54:00.328 --> 00:54:03.669
I knew I had to change things. 
Or else I'd die.

952
00:54:06.267 --> 00:54:08.412
That's why you really aren't
ready to die just yet, right?

953
00:54:09.448 --> 00:54:10.873
Still have to try to make things right?

954
00:54:12.519 --> 00:54:13.136
Yeah.

955
00:54:17.113 --> 00:54:17.749
So...

956
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:21.052
Who wants to go next?

957
00:55:38.187 --> 00:55:40.264
Just to remind all of you,

958
00:55:40.264 --> 00:55:40.271
Just to remind all of you,
the time is currently three sixteen and twenty two seconds.


959
00:55:40.271 --> 00:55:45.764
the time is currently three
sixteen and twenty two seconds.

960
00:55:45.764 --> 00:55:53.684
You have less than one hour and
twenty one minutes left to complete your tasks.

961
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:54.991
We got it.

962
00:55:55.566 --> 00:55:56.416
Do you?

963
00:55:58.157 --> 00:56:00.084
There are now...two of you who
have some serious work to do.

964
00:56:00.084 --> 00:56:04.764
I would advise you to
attend to the undertaking at hand.

965
00:56:04.764 --> 00:56:04.766
I would advise you to attend to the undertaking at hand.
Post haste.


966
00:56:04.766 --> 00:56:05.536
Post haste.

967
00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:06.900
Hehehe.

968
00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.128
I said "undertaking" without even realizing it.

969
00:56:17.155 --> 00:56:18.031
Shit.

970
00:56:19.056 --> 00:56:20.740
My mind is...drawing a blank..

971
00:56:20.904 --> 00:56:22.252
I can't think..

972
00:56:22.835 --> 00:56:24.014
I don't know anyone else who...

973
00:56:24.014 --> 00:56:24.016
I don't know anyone else who...
I don't mean to put another proverbial fly in the motherfuckin' ointment here,


974
00:56:24.016 --> 00:56:27.654
I don't mean to put another
proverbial fly in the motherfuckin' ointment here,

975
00:56:27.654 --> 00:56:27.662
I don't mean to put another proverbial fly in the motherfuckin' ointment here,
but we have to figure out what to do with these bodies, too.


976
00:56:27.662 --> 00:56:30.174
but we have to figure out
what to do with these bodies, too.

977
00:56:30.174 --> 00:56:30.176
but we have to figure out what to do with these bodies, too.
I mean, once this is all over with...


978
00:56:30.176 --> 00:56:31.654
I mean, once this is all over with...

979
00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:31.658
I mean, once this is all over with...
You're right.


980
00:56:31.658 --> 00:56:32.332
You're right.

981
00:56:32.397 --> 00:56:35.265
With my...record â€“ I am so
screwed if I get caught with...

982
00:56:35.665 --> 00:56:38.474
Jesus! Can we just focus
on getting two more people here

983
00:56:38.474 --> 00:56:38.477
Jesus! Can we just focus on getting two more people here
so Rachel and I don't fucking die!


984
00:56:38.477 --> 00:56:40.679
so Rachel and I don't fucking die!

985
00:56:42.161 --> 00:56:44.984
I don't give a shit
about going to jail right now

986
00:56:44.984 --> 00:56:44.987
I don't give a shit about going to jail right now
â€“ I just want to live!


987
00:56:44.987 --> 00:56:46.604
â€“ I just want to live!

988
00:56:46.604 --> 00:56:46.610
â€“ I just want to live!
Mel, it's okay, we'll figure this whole thing out.


989
00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:49.471
Mel, it's okay, we'll
figure this whole thing out.

990
00:56:50.046 --> 00:56:51.844
Look, what I was saying before...

991
00:56:53.985 --> 00:56:56.465
There's a reason we were chosen.

992
00:56:57.056 --> 00:57:00.304
Think, hard... 
Probably something you don't want to dredge up.

993
00:57:00.304 --> 00:57:00.309
Think, hard... Probably something you don't want to dredge up.
It could be the key.


994
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:01.391
It could be the key.

995
00:57:02.393 --> 00:57:03.334
What happened to you?

996
00:57:03.334 --> 00:57:03.338
What happened to you?
Why do you think that?


997
00:57:03.338 --> 00:57:04.801
Why do you think that?

998
00:57:05.281 --> 00:57:08.652
Just because this chick was
a legit junkie - no offense

999
00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:10.744
I did something.

1000
00:57:12.107 --> 00:57:12.686
Tell us...

1001
00:57:15.246 --> 00:57:19.041
Before when it was just
my mom and me, my brother...

1002
00:57:20.473 --> 00:57:22.384
I did some things to help us get by. 
Stuff I'm not particularly proud of now.

1003
00:57:22.384 --> 00:57:22.393
I did some things to help us get by. Stuff I'm not particularly proud of now.
Like what?


1004
00:57:22.393 --> 00:57:22.976
Like what?

1005
00:57:23.707 --> 00:57:29.904
Just petty crimes, shoplifting, mostly,
getting us stuff we needed...

1006
00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:29.909
Just petty crimes, shoplifting, mostly, getting us stuff we needed...
But, there was one day when...


1007
00:57:29.909 --> 00:57:33.441
But, there was one day when...

1008
00:58:06.347 --> 00:58:08.062
Come back here!

1009
00:58:23.924 --> 00:58:24.945
Help!

1010
00:58:26.515 --> 00:58:28.065
I don't know what happened to that guy.

1011
00:58:28.683 --> 00:58:30.058
I never went back there.

1012
00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.144
That was brave of you to share, Bradley.

1013
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.770
I'm just...

1014
00:58:35.677 --> 00:58:37.311
trying to help you guys think of...

1015
00:58:38.945 --> 00:58:39.879
I don't know.

1016
00:58:43.673 --> 00:58:44.854
I don't know.

1017
00:58:44.984 --> 00:58:46.660
But why's it all on me?

1018
00:58:47.486 --> 00:58:48.793
Rachel, what about you?

1019
00:58:49.464 --> 00:58:53.025
If we all have some dark
secret bullshit, why don't you go?

1020
00:58:53.224 --> 00:58:56.957
I, um...I've been racking my brain, but
I haven't been able to think of anything.

1021
00:58:57.456 --> 00:58:58.204
I'm not just saying that.

1022
00:58:58.204 --> 00:58:58.210
I'm not just saying that.
I...Maybe there is something I might have...blocked?


1023
00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:00.754
I...Maybe there is something I might have...blocked?

1024
00:59:00.754 --> 00:59:00.763
I...Maybe there is something I might have...blocked?
My subconscious?


1025
00:59:00.763 --> 00:59:01.974
My subconscious?

1026
00:59:02.427 --> 00:59:03.178
I don't know.

1027
00:59:06.073 --> 00:59:08.831
Rachel, you are on the right track.

1028
00:59:10.218 --> 00:59:12.450
Your instincts are remarkable.

1029
00:59:14.945 --> 00:59:15.734
Just remember.

1030
00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:19.795
You can use your
past to shape your future.

1031
00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:23.498
Thanks, Dr. Fucking Phil.

1032
00:59:24.854 --> 00:59:28.924
I truly do appreciate how you
treat life like a game, Melanie.

1033
00:59:28.924 --> 00:59:28.926
I truly do appreciate how you treat life like a game, Melanie.
But when you don't realize,


1034
00:59:28.926 --> 00:59:30.584
But when you don't realize,

1035
00:59:30.584 --> 00:59:32.264
is when you lose,

1036
00:59:32.264 --> 00:59:32.271
is when you lose,
you really do lose.


1037
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:34.225
you really do lose.

1038
00:59:36.705 --> 00:59:37.513
Ahhh!

1039
00:59:37.772 --> 00:59:38.904
I don't care. Anymore.

1040
00:59:38.904 --> 00:59:38.907
I don't care. Anymore.
I don't. I don't want to die.


1041
00:59:38.907 --> 00:59:40.464
I don't. I don't want to die.

1042
00:59:40.464 --> 00:59:40.465
I don't. I don't want to die.
We just need to get someone here.


1043
00:59:40.465 --> 00:59:41.514
We just need to get someone here.

1044
00:59:41.514 --> 00:59:41.521
We just need to get someone here.
Anyone.


1045
00:59:41.521 --> 00:59:42.014
Anyone.

1046
00:59:42.014 --> 00:59:42.020
Anyone.
Ok, wait.


1047
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.018
Ok, wait.

1048
00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:45.052
I'll go.

1049
00:59:48.656 --> 00:59:51.006
You guys have known
me for a long time.

1050
00:59:51.456 --> 00:59:53.239
You know I'm an honest person;

1051
00:59:53.513 --> 00:59:54.945
I don't have anything to hide.

1052
00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:58.144
In school, I was the
same way I am now.

1053
00:59:58.144 --> 00:59:58.153
In school, I was the same way I am now.
I like to have a good time,


1054
00:59:58.153 --> 01:00:00.081
I like to have a good time,

1055
01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:02.770
I don't give a shit
about what anyone thinks of me.

1056
01:00:04.824 --> 01:00:08.797
One summer, when I went up stair, 
I was at a party...

1057
01:00:14.161 --> 01:00:15.724
No way that happened.

1058
01:00:15.724 --> 01:00:15.730
No way that happened.
It did.


1059
01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:16.702
It did.

1060
01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:18.514
Cross my heart.

1061
01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:18.515
Cross my heart.
Yeah but you ain't got a heart, Rick


1062
01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:19.844
Yeah but you ain't got a heart, Rick

1063
01:00:19.844 --> 01:00:19.848
Yeah but you ain't got a heart, Rick
Don't be jealous, babe.


1064
01:00:19.848 --> 01:00:21.620
Don't be jealous, babe.

1065
01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:24.458
Anyway, how it went actually went down,

1066
01:00:25.418 --> 01:00:28.034
I'm in the back of
the squad car, cuffed, hating life

1067
01:00:28.034 --> 01:00:28.039
I'm in the back of the squad car, cuffed, hating life
â€“ and then the cop goes "oh shit,"


1068
01:00:28.039 --> 01:00:30.561
â€“ and then the cop goes "oh shit,"

1069
01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:32.734
and I look up
and see what he sees:

1070
01:00:32.734 --> 01:00:32.736
and I look up and see what he sees:
there's this HUGE dude on the side of the road, just tweeking out


1071
01:00:32.736 --> 01:00:37.003
there's this HUGE dude on the
side of the road, just tweeking out

1072
01:00:37.353 --> 01:00:40.514
He buckin up and down like
a bronco with his nuts in vice.

1073
01:00:40.514 --> 01:00:40.519
He buckin up and down like a bronco with his nuts in vice.
So I'm like,


1074
01:00:40.519 --> 01:00:41.984
So I'm like,

1075
01:00:41.984 --> 01:00:41.985
So I'm like,
"Uh, that dude's on bath salts."


1076
01:00:41.985 --> 01:00:44.014
"Uh, that dude's on bath salts."

1077
01:00:44.014 --> 01:00:44.020
"Uh, that dude's on bath salts."
And the cop looks back at me and just goes again "Shit."


1078
01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.481
And the cop looks back at
me and just goes again "Shit."

1079
01:00:47.281 --> 01:00:51.570
So he pulls over, and approaches this beast,
like all "whoah uh hey are you all right?"\

1080
01:00:51.886 --> 01:00:53.528
and the dude lunges for him.

1081
01:00:54.088 --> 01:00:55.772
But the cop surprised the shit outta me

1082
01:00:55.883 --> 01:00:58.511
â€“ he was crazy fast and
got the guy in cuffs mad quick.

1083
01:00:58.884 --> 01:01:01.804
So he's trying to like, 
I dunno, subdue him or whatever,

1084
01:01:01.804 --> 01:01:01.806
So he's trying to like, I dunno, subdue him or whatever,
but the dude is still thrashing about, kicking, biting, just some mental shit.


1085
01:01:01.806 --> 01:01:06.096
but the dude is still thrashing
about, kicking, biting, just some mental shit.

1086
01:01:06.473 --> 01:01:11.791
So the cop comes back to the car, yanks
me out, takes the cuffs off me and goes

1087
01:01:12.286 --> 01:01:13.159
"Go."

1088
01:01:13.384 --> 01:01:15.601
I didn't say a word â€“
I just booked it outta there,

1089
01:01:16.313 --> 01:01:20.984
but, I looked back and saw the cop kicking the
crap outta the dude and then throwing him in the car.

1090
01:01:20.984 --> 01:01:23.304
I don't get it. 
Why'd he let you go?

1091
01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:26.172
He couldn't put that maniac in the
back with me, he'd eat my face off.

1092
01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:32.283
This was a much bigger fish for
him than me, a friggin' pot possession misdemeanor.

1093
01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:33.467
Damn.

1094
01:01:33.978 --> 01:01:34.721
You got lucky.

1095
01:01:36.031 --> 01:01:39.818
Melz, you have more
Bolivian Marching Powder or what?

1096
01:01:42.534 --> 01:01:43.311
I do...

1097
01:01:44.062 --> 01:01:44.766
But?

1098
01:01:46.888 --> 01:01:48.359
I'm not sure if it's good or not.

1099
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:52.553
Well let's give it a shot, homie.

1100
01:01:53.254 --> 01:01:53.848
Um...

1101
01:01:56.473 --> 01:01:57.239
okay

1102
01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:07.947
be my guest.

1103
01:02:24.134 --> 01:02:24.774
What?

1104
01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:24.782
What?
Something ain't...right.


1105
01:02:24.782 --> 01:02:26.618
Something ain't...right.

1106
01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:31.921
Where'd you get this shit?

1107
01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:35.250
My guy was out, and
he got this from someone else.

1108
01:02:35.688 --> 01:02:36.594
He gave it to me.

1109
01:02:36.594 --> 01:02:36.599
He gave it to me.
Said I should just try and see if


1110
01:02:36.599 --> 01:02:38.218
Said I should just try and see if

1111
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:57.844
What happened?

1112
01:02:57.844 --> 01:02:57.852
What happened?
They did some bad shit!


1113
01:02:57.852 --> 01:02:59.354
They did some bad shit!

1114
01:02:59.354 --> 01:02:59.361
They did some bad shit!
Call 9-1-1.


1115
01:02:59.361 --> 01:03:00.484
Call 9-1-1.

1116
01:03:12.827 --> 01:03:13.966
I never looked back.

1117
01:03:15.117 --> 01:03:18.004
Got on a bus that night and... 
I never looked back.

1118
01:03:19.608 --> 01:03:22.984
I heard the girl
was hospitalized, was eventually ok...

1119
01:03:22.984 --> 01:03:25.353
But not the guy.

1120
01:03:28.724 --> 01:03:29.634
Use that pain.

1121
01:03:30.624 --> 01:03:32.664
Use it to help yourself.

1122
01:03:33.104 --> 01:03:36.184
This is the most important
moment of your life, Melanie.

1123
01:03:36.894 --> 01:03:37.804
You're right.

1124
01:03:38.694 --> 01:03:40.074
You've always been right.

1125
01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:41.244
What?

1126
01:03:42.134 --> 01:03:43.534
My dealer. Frisco.

1127
01:03:43.594 --> 01:03:46.134
He is a good guy,
for the most part, but

1128
01:03:46.804 --> 01:03:48.254
it was his stuff.

1129
01:03:48.664 --> 01:03:52.994
He is responsible for
supplying innocent people with poison.

1130
01:03:54.284 --> 01:03:55.414
He should go.

1131
01:03:56.194 --> 01:03:57.224
That's my girl.

1132
01:03:57.784 --> 01:03:58.744
I'm gonna do it.

1133
01:03:59.964 --> 01:04:01.624
It will be easy to get him here.

1134
01:04:01.714 --> 01:04:03.504
He works nights, usually.

1135
01:04:03.784 --> 01:04:05.984
Sounds about right for that profession.

1136
01:04:06.694 --> 01:04:08.524
And I am going
to do it this time.

1137
01:04:09.094 --> 01:04:10.154
No hesitation.

1138
01:04:10.404 --> 01:04:12.034
As soon as he gets here.

1139
01:04:20.544 --> 01:04:22.954
The minute he gets here.

1140
01:04:24.654 --> 01:04:26.154
But I need something...better.

1141
01:04:27.274 --> 01:04:28.424
Where's your basement?

1142
01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:51.954
Wise choice.

1143
01:04:53.524 --> 01:04:54.464
Better hurry.

1144
01:05:05.604 --> 01:05:06.904
...Why??

1145
01:05:15.674 --> 01:05:16.434
AARRGGHHH!

1146
01:05:20.634 --> 01:05:21.734
No, no, no..

1147
01:05:33.404 --> 01:05:36.874
And then there was one.

1148
01:05:45.764 --> 01:05:47.854
Somebody please shut that up.

1149
01:05:50.384 --> 01:05:51.414
It's Maestro's.

1150
01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:52.674
Just turn it off!

1151
01:05:53.894 --> 01:05:54.864
Well, well.

1152
01:05:55.664 --> 01:05:58.294
Your other invited guest has arrived.

1153
01:05:58.294 --> 01:06:01.494
This may be your
lucky day after all, Rachel.

1154
01:06:03.034 --> 01:06:04.334
He's here.

1155
01:06:07.614 --> 01:06:08.754
Moment of truth, Rachel

1156
01:06:09.804 --> 01:06:12.174
Do you want to live, or die?

1157
01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:21.234
I'd love to watch this one
go down, if no one minds.

1158
01:06:24.164 --> 01:06:25.494
Um, come in.

1159
01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:31.134
Oh hell no.

1160
01:06:35.364 --> 01:06:37.284
Well fuck me runnin'.

1161
01:06:40.064 --> 01:06:41.484
It's not over, Rachel.

1162
01:06:43.444 --> 01:06:44.834
There's only twelve minutes left.

1163
01:06:45.594 --> 01:06:46.424
I'm done.

1164
01:06:50.854 --> 01:06:55.354
Oh, come now, Rachel. 
That's not the attitude I expect from you.

1165
01:06:58.404 --> 01:06:58.874
Yeah?

1166
01:07:00.964 --> 01:07:04.274
Was it easy to become
valedictorian of your high school?

1167
01:07:04.274 --> 01:07:08.544
Was it easy to
become all-conference in basketball? Hmm?

1168
01:07:09.114 --> 01:07:12.804
You're like an inspirational speaker from Hell.

1169
01:07:15.014 --> 01:07:16.244
Was it easy?

1170
01:07:17.314 --> 01:07:19.764
to get over what happened in college?

1171
01:07:21.374 --> 01:07:23.064
What happened in college?

1172
01:07:23.764 --> 01:07:25.304
Like you said Rachel.

1173
01:07:25.584 --> 01:07:26.664
It's buried.

1174
01:07:47.144 --> 01:07:47.674
Hey.

1175
01:07:48.204 --> 01:07:49.264
Oh, hi.

1176
01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:53.414
Did you finish the your thesis paper?

1177
01:07:53.954 --> 01:07:55.464
Still working on it.

1178
01:07:55.974 --> 01:07:57.984
Oh. I'm almost done, too.

1179
01:08:02.644 --> 01:08:04.874
Look, I know this
is, kind of awkward, but..

1180
01:08:04.874 --> 01:08:08.404
I just wanted to wish you luck.

1181
01:08:10.884 --> 01:08:11.414
Yeah?

1182
01:08:12.304 --> 01:08:16.764
I mean, look, I'll just address
the elephant in the dorm room.

1183
01:08:19.114 --> 01:08:23.124
Everyone knows we are the only
two students in contention for the scholarship.

1184
01:08:23.674 --> 01:08:24.694
I just...

1185
01:08:25.724 --> 01:08:27.434
I know it's always been weird between us,

1186
01:08:27.434 --> 01:08:30.814
this, competitive thing, but I really like you,

1187
01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:33.254
and I, I don't know.

1188
01:08:33.624 --> 01:08:34.504
I just,

1189
01:08:35.774 --> 01:08:36.944
I wish you luck.

1190
01:08:40.084 --> 01:08:41.244
I like you, too, Lara.

1191
01:08:42.114 --> 01:08:42.994
Good luck.

1192
01:10:59.684 --> 01:11:02.184
Get rid of all of this.

1193
01:11:54.664 --> 01:11:56.034
I got the scholarship.

1194
01:11:57.984 --> 01:11:58.724
Lara...

1195
01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:01.094
accused me of the whole thing, but

1196
01:12:02.094 --> 01:12:04.174
since it looked like we just got burglarized,

1197
01:12:04.174 --> 01:12:05.954
the school board didn't convict me.

1198
01:12:08.404 --> 01:12:11.294
I went on to grad
school, as you guys obviously know,

1199
01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:12.464
but Lara...

1200
01:12:15.514 --> 01:12:16.724
she never recovered.

1201
01:12:19.014 --> 01:12:22.654
She went on that clichÃ© downward spiral;

1202
01:12:24.334 --> 01:12:25.684
she starting drinking,

1203
01:12:27.424 --> 01:12:28.574
taking pills,

1204
01:12:30.574 --> 01:12:31.314
and then,

1205
01:12:32.774 --> 01:12:34.804
one day I heard, she...

1206
01:12:51.094 --> 01:12:53.024
I honestly haven't thought about that in years.

1207
01:13:06.694 --> 01:13:08.644
All cards on the table.

1208
01:13:09.784 --> 01:13:12.424
You've always done what you've
needed to do to survive.

1209
01:13:14.914 --> 01:13:17.174
Don't worry about who
is innocent, and who's not.

1210
01:13:17.384 --> 01:13:18.594
Five minute warning.

1211
01:13:23.444 --> 01:13:25.444
Just one more soul.

1212
01:13:37.154 --> 01:13:37.774
Rachel..

1213
01:13:43.584 --> 01:13:45.644
You need us to commit
these sins for some reason.

1214
01:13:51.824 --> 01:13:54.574
I'll take whatever fate has in
store for me, you rancid skank.

1215
01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.174
Looks like I'm a little early.

1216
01:14:21.314 --> 01:14:22.174
Who are you?

1217
01:14:22.534 --> 01:14:23.414
What are you?

1218
01:14:24.464 --> 01:14:26.384
You're the guy who's supposed to kill us?

1219
01:14:27.104 --> 01:14:27.744
No.

1220
01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:29.824
Just to kill me now.

1221
01:14:30.684 --> 01:14:32.194
You don't look so fucking tough.

1222
01:14:33.114 --> 01:14:34.364
You are mistaken.

1223
01:14:34.954 --> 01:14:37.364
I simply make The Collection.

1224
01:14:37.764 --> 01:14:38.784
What â€˜collection?'

1225
01:14:39.674 --> 01:14:42.594
I collect the freed souls of the dead.

1226
01:14:43.144 --> 01:14:45.444
So what does that make you?

1227
01:14:50.144 --> 01:14:51.694
Looks like the jig is up.

1228
01:14:51.994 --> 01:14:53.734
Finally. You found me out.

1229
01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:55.784
I am not the â€˜angel of death.'

1230
01:14:55.784 --> 01:14:57.344
Like our nice friend here.

1231
01:14:58.694 --> 01:14:59.884
Oh my god.

1232
01:14:59.884 --> 01:15:00.544
Close.

1233
01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:04.384
I am a fallen angel, though.

1234
01:15:04.994 --> 01:15:06.994
You've been playing us this whole time.

1235
01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:10.054
That's correct, Rachel.

1236
01:15:10.394 --> 01:15:11.634
But we had a deal!

1237
01:15:12.444 --> 01:15:13.584
Death doesn't make deals.

1238
01:15:16.944 --> 01:15:17.624
That's right.

1239
01:15:17.624 --> 01:15:19.164
I knew we couldn't trust you.

1240
01:15:19.164 --> 01:15:22.094
You've been lying to us
ever since you got here.

1241
01:15:22.204 --> 01:15:26.384
They don't call me the
Father of Lies for nothing, sweetheart.

1242
01:15:26.384 --> 01:15:28.964
Didn't think you were this naive...

1243
01:15:29.814 --> 01:15:30.984
You're the devil.

1244
01:15:31.074 --> 01:15:32.354
Why did you do this??

1245
01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:39.364
As this nice gentleman here can attest,

1246
01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:45.584
all of your fates were sealed earlier tonight
- when the approaching maniac escaped his confines

1247
01:15:46.664 --> 01:15:47.804
that part is absolutely true.

1248
01:15:49.064 --> 01:15:50.714
You are all going to die in...

1249
01:15:50.714 --> 01:15:51.704
Less than three minutes.

1250
01:15:51.704 --> 01:15:54.234
And Rachel.. hehehe..

1251
01:15:54.234 --> 01:15:59.454
You were so close to figuring it
out â€“ why I chose all of you.

1252
01:16:00.934 --> 01:16:03.634
We each did something in our past that
was very bad - but not bad enough.

1253
01:16:03.724 --> 01:16:06.604
Give this girl a gold star.

1254
01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:08.124
...No.

1255
01:16:08.774 --> 01:16:11.984
You wanted each of us to commit a
mortal sin, so our souls ...would be dammed.

1256
01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.624
Would be yours.

1257
01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:16.244
Forever and ever.

1258
01:16:16.684 --> 01:16:18.114
But we've proven that we can change fate

1259
01:16:18.754 --> 01:16:21.664
- We took other people's lives! We intervened 
- We changed everything!!

1260
01:16:23.284 --> 01:16:26.744
That doesn't change a god damn thing.

1261
01:17:45.004 --> 01:17:47.894
AAHHH!

1262
01:17:53.394 --> 01:17:54.464
AARRGHGGHHGHHH!

1263
01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:21.534
AARRGHGGHHGHHH!

1264
01:19:02.394 --> 01:19:04.104
You said he was gonna kill us all.

1265
01:19:05.344 --> 01:19:06.464
That was our fate.

1266
01:19:08.214 --> 01:19:09.444
Now, he's dead.

1267
01:19:10.564 --> 01:19:11.884
It's over.

1268
01:19:14.644 --> 01:19:16.594
You got all the souls you were expecting.

1269
01:19:16.594 --> 01:19:17.814
And then some.

1270
01:19:20.104 --> 01:19:21.204
I'm leaving.

1271
01:19:26.214 --> 01:19:26.874
Wait,

1272
01:19:28.094 --> 01:19:29.304
where's Stephanie?

1273
01:19:29.874 --> 01:19:30.624
Hey.

1274
01:19:48.654 --> 01:19:49.724
Did I do good, master?

1275
01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:52.494
You did wonderfully.

1276
01:19:58.704 --> 01:20:03.444
Still hard for me to get
used to you in this...body, my lord.

1277
01:20:03.744 --> 01:20:08.454
Everything is temporary, my sweet child.

1278
01:20:08.754 --> 01:20:12.034
It wasn't easy keeping up this
holy roller act this whole time, y'know.

1279
01:20:12.034 --> 01:20:12.944
Oh, I do know.

1280
01:20:13.594 --> 01:20:17.314
I have known you were special,
ever since you first contacted me.

1281
01:20:19.054 --> 01:20:22.554
After what went down with Harmony, 
I was truly lost.

1282
01:20:23.864 --> 01:20:25.174
I tried to...

1283
01:21:55.754 --> 01:21:59.474
Stephanieee...I hear you.

1284
01:22:13.324 --> 01:22:15.094
Hi dude, how are you doing today?

1285
01:22:16.204 --> 01:22:17.054
Shitty.

1286
01:23:04.534 --> 01:23:06.284
You've been a very loyal servant.

1287
01:23:06.484 --> 01:23:08.954
And you, the perfect leader.

1288
01:23:10.174 --> 01:23:13.534
Now go and spread your wings, little bird.

1289
01:23:13.534 --> 01:23:15.864
We have much to plan for the future.

1290
01:23:32.004 --> 01:23:32.964
Are you her?

1291
01:23:33.524 --> 01:23:34.194
Huh?

1292
01:23:34.484 --> 01:23:35.234
Who?

1293
01:23:37.124 --> 01:23:40.414
I know he's in there,
don't play dumb with me

1294
01:23:41.284 --> 01:23:42.324
- I followed him...

1295
01:23:43.764 --> 01:23:45.254
He swore he would stop...

1296
01:23:46.744 --> 01:23:49.214
He swore on our children's lives...

1297
01:23:49.904 --> 01:23:51.844
Ma'am, I don't know

1298
01:23:52.044 --> 01:23:52.854
"Ma'am?"

1299
01:23:54.104 --> 01:23:55.684
You gonna fuck my husband

1300
01:23:55.684 --> 01:23:58.884
and then you talk to
me like I'm some old dog?

1301
01:24:02.494 --> 01:24:03.364
I didn't do that.

1302
01:24:03.374 --> 01:24:04.394
Okay, just calm down...

1303
01:24:04.394 --> 01:24:09.624
The idiot doesn't know his goddam
social accounts are linked to our iPad.

1304
01:24:11.064 --> 01:24:12.584
I saw what happened,

1305
01:24:13.084 --> 01:24:16.904
YOU contacted him...you little slut.

1306
01:24:16.904 --> 01:24:20.054
No, no, I promise you,
it's not what you think.

1307
01:24:20.604 --> 01:24:21.854
It's not?

1308
01:24:24.864 --> 01:24:26.224
Where's my husband?

1309
01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:28.424
He, um...

1310
01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.104
This is pointless.

1311
01:25:16.954 --> 01:25:19.744
I will finish up in here,
and then come take care of this.

1312
01:25:20.534 --> 01:25:23.124
I'll see you when you
come down to make your delivery.

1313
01:26:26.354 --> 01:26:29.644
â€˜Call no man happy until he is dead.'
