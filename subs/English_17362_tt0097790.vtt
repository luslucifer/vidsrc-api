1
00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:08.981
That's good.

2
00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:30.135
Jenny?

3
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:39.639
Jenny's gonna come any second!

4
00:03:39.814 --> 00:03:41.111
Hey, how you doing?

5
00:03:45.153 --> 00:03:48.384
Yeah, I was gonna spend the night
alone with Jenny tonight.


6
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.218
Pussy whipped!

7
00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.791
All right, maybe one beer.
That's it.


8
00:03:56.464 --> 00:03:58.329
The party's on!

9
00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.536
You know, hey, I cleaned earlier.
Yeah, thank you.


10
00:04:35.603 --> 00:04:36.900
Jenny.

11
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.805
Some of the guys dropped by.

12
00:04:41.943 --> 00:04:43.535
Hug me?

13
00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:44.972
Will you?

14
00:04:50.685 --> 00:04:52.346
Party's over.

15
00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:07.933
What's the matter, no-dick?
Jen throw you out?


16
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:12.170
No.

17
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.503
Yeah, well, tell her I'm available,
huh?


18
00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:18.912
- Why don't you go home, Jory.
- You wanna make me?


19
00:05:19.247 --> 00:05:20.509
Hey, God...

20
00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:23.140
Goddamn shit!

21
00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:25.615
Come on, Jenny, open up.

22
00:05:26.187 --> 00:05:29.645
Come on, Jen, my dad's coming.
Look, at least let me get my stuff.


23
00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:32.820
- You're kept.
- I'm what?


24
00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:36.193
You cleaned?

25
00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:39.561
Look, Jenny, I know it's
hard to explain, but-


26
00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:42.202
Seems simple. It's our last night
before break.


27
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.804
You'd rather be barfing
with your beer buddies.


28
00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:48.235
- I get the hint, Randy.
- No, I wasn't- Okay, you're pissed?


29
00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:50.907
No, I'm not. I am not.

30
00:05:51.078 --> 00:05:52.739
You know, I should thank you.

31
00:05:52.914 --> 00:05:55.781
You finally made it very clear to me
where I stand.


32
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.812
Jenny.

33
00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:01.816
I don't want to break up with you.
Look, I got you a present.


34
00:06:02.456 --> 00:06:07.155
I know the wrapping's a little primitive,
but it's nice. Go ahead, open it.


35
00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:09.658
I'll open it, I'll help.

36
00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:13.961
Okay. There.
What do you think?


37
00:06:14.168 --> 00:06:18.002
- A football jersey?
- Yeah. Looks great, doesn't it?


38
00:06:20.508 --> 00:06:23.204
Jenny, I wanted to be
with you last night.


39
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:25.845
The guys, they just pushed
their way in, and-


40
00:06:26.013 --> 00:06:28.277
Then why didn't you stand up
for yourself?


41
00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:30.981
And why don't you ever
stand up for me?


42
00:06:31.152 --> 00:06:32.847
- Well, I do.
- Yeah?


43
00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:35.587
- Yeah.
- Like you do with your parents?


44
00:06:36.023 --> 00:06:38.992
- What?
- You hide me from your parents.


45
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.924
You told them
your roommate's name was Vic.


46
00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:45.327
- Randy, you did.
- Jenny, look.


47
00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:47.694
My dad's gonna be pissed
with my grades.


48
00:06:47.868 --> 00:06:50.632
It's not good to tell him
I'm living with a girl.


49
00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:53.907
So I'm just supposed to be
your secret little boy-toy?


50
00:06:54.075 --> 00:06:56.305
You're not my boy-toy.
I'm gonna tell them.


51
00:06:56.911 --> 00:06:59.607
- When?
- As soon as I see them.


52
00:07:02.216 --> 00:07:03.615
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


53
00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:05.913
Really?

54
00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:08.521
Really.

55
00:07:24.605 --> 00:07:27.699
Son, sorry I'm late, but the traffic
was hell out there.


56
00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:29.570
You ready to go?
It's good to...


57
00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:31.807
- Dad. Dad!
- ... see you.


58
00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.971
Good to see you. You look great.
How you been?


59
00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:38.982
Oh, excuse me. I'm Randy's dad.
Nice to meet you.


60
00:07:39.153 --> 00:07:41.144
So? What's going on?

61
00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:43.648
- So where's Vic?
- Vic...


62
00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:46.150
- Your roommate-
- You missed him.


63
00:07:46.327 --> 00:07:49.160
His dad was here.
No, you missed him.


64
00:07:50.097 --> 00:07:53.032
- Nice meeting you.
- I'll call you, Jenny.


65
00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:55.492
Well, hey. Okay.

66
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.165
- Yeah.
- Who was that?


67
00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.331
What? Oh, she's my bio tutor.

68
00:08:01.709 --> 00:08:04.303
She thought she left a book here.

69
00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:09.611
- Maybe I better give you a hand.
- No, no, that's not- Okay, yeah.


70
00:08:14.455 --> 00:08:17.049
Your mom would've come,
but she had a final today.


71
00:08:17.224 --> 00:08:18.748
Final? Final for what?

72
00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:21.921
She's taking a
landscape-architecture class.


73
00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:25.030
- She's doing real well too.
- That's good, Dad.


74
00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:28.166
Hey, you got a problem?

75
00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:30.766
No, bad latch, Dad.
Bad latch.


76
00:08:30.938 --> 00:08:32.769
- So how'd you do?
- Do?


77
00:08:33.707 --> 00:08:38.076
- Grades, son. How were the grades?
- Oh, well, Dad. That's kind of a...


78
00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:39.769
...subjective thing.

79
00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:43.943
Subjective, huh?

80
00:08:44.418 --> 00:08:48.252
F in geometry. Now, what the hell's
so subjective about that?


81
00:08:48.422 --> 00:08:51.823
See, everybody flunks that
the first time, Dad.


82
00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:55.429
And this D here,
what's that for?


83
00:08:55.596 --> 00:08:57.655
That teacher hates my guts, Dad.

84
00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:00.462
And these "Incs"?

85
00:09:01.135 --> 00:09:02.500
What are these "Incs"?

86
00:09:03.237 --> 00:09:06.866
"Incomplete." It's cool.
I can make it up.


87
00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:13.702
Look, Dad, I tried to study.
I really did, but things came up.


88
00:09:14.782 --> 00:09:17.216
I'm sorry about school.
I won't do it again.


89
00:09:17.384 --> 00:09:19.875
Damn right, you won't.
I'm not sending you back.


90
00:09:20.054 --> 00:09:21.453
And no more free ride!

91
00:09:21.622 --> 00:09:24.648
Joe, we agreed for him to have
opportunities we never had.


92
00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:26.952
The first Bodek to graduate
from college.


93
00:09:27.128 --> 00:09:29.289
People who look like that
don't graduate.


94
00:09:29.463 --> 00:09:33.365
I don't think I'm out of line. He's
been in school, what, two years?


95
00:09:33.534 --> 00:09:36.162
He does not have a clue
what he's doing there!


96
00:09:36.337 --> 00:09:39.829
- He can't declare a, what's it called?
- Major.


97
00:09:40.007 --> 00:09:41.634
Major, right. I'll be damned...

98
00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:46.337
...if I'll keep throwing good money after
bad money while he's looking like this.


99
00:09:47.081 --> 00:09:48.639
Oh, that's great!

100
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:51.975
- Don't think this changes a thing!
- Don't send me back.


101
00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:55.054
Well, I mean, look.

102
00:09:57.324 --> 00:09:59.155
I mean, you're right.

103
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.793
Okay?

104
00:10:02.563 --> 00:10:06.363
I don't know what I'm doing in school.
So I don't go back.


105
00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:11.030
Well, I'll start my real life.

106
00:10:11.305 --> 00:10:13.239
How bad could it be?

107
00:10:13.774 --> 00:10:16.140
Yeah, what kind of cheese
you want on that?


108
00:10:16.343 --> 00:10:19.141
- Extra gooey.
- No, extra tangy.


109
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.710
- Tangy...
- Gooey.


110
00:10:23.684 --> 00:10:24.946
Right.

111
00:10:25.219 --> 00:10:26.516
That's...

112
00:10:27.221 --> 00:10:28.518
...22.

113
00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:33.149
I gotta get back to school.

114
00:10:33.327 --> 00:10:35.386
It's a summer job.
What'd you expect?


115
00:10:35.563 --> 00:10:37.190
It's a summer job for you.

116
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:39.431
This is life for me.

117
00:10:40.634 --> 00:10:44.229
$4.80 an hour. You know, people here
from Mexico make more than that.


118
00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:47.033
Yeah. Well, we pay Juan $5.10.

119
00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:49.106
He's got more experience.

120
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:52.772
I gotta get some training in something.

121
00:10:52.947 --> 00:10:56.280
I wanna work triple shifts. I need
to make 9 grand by September.


122
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.248
Oh, 9 grand? Okay, let's see.
$4.80 an hour.


123
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.117
Sixteen-hour days, two and a half
months, no spending money.


124
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.952
We're looking at about
half of what you need.


125
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.762
I think you just better start enjoying
the one perk we got here.


126
00:11:11.565 --> 00:11:13.157
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.


127
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.628
Can I help you?

128
00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:17.167
Oh, we're thinking.

129
00:11:20.674 --> 00:11:23.837
- We'd like a large Italian.
- What?


130
00:11:25.746 --> 00:11:27.805
- A large vegetarian.
- Okay.


131
00:11:27.982 --> 00:11:29.882
- And...
- And two Diet Cokes, no ice.


132
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.143
Two Diet
- No ice.

133
00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:35.917
Here's your number, number 16.
We'll be with you in a moment.


134
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.955
Tell me, tell me.
Who is that guy?


135
00:11:42.663 --> 00:11:44.790
He's an exchange student from Italy.

136
00:11:44.965 --> 00:11:46.830
- Really?
- Oh, really.


137
00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:50.227
Man, I can't believe they go for
that Pepé Le Pew shit.


138
00:11:51.005 --> 00:11:52.597
So cute.

139
00:11:53.874 --> 00:11:55.398
Think he's taken?

140
00:12:00.748 --> 00:12:03.740
- Hey, man, that shit works for you.
- No.


141
00:12:04.084 --> 00:12:05.779
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not interested.


142
00:12:05.953 --> 00:12:08.012
- Oh, come on. Yes!
- No. No!


143
00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:12.682
Jenny is 150 miles away. She won't
even return your calls. Give it up.


144
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.691
Look alive out here, will you?

145
00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:18.025
- Say you love delivery, right here.
- Caught a bad pepperoni.


146
00:12:18.198 --> 00:12:19.563
Such a wise guy.

147
00:12:20.868 --> 00:12:24.895
Okay, Bodek. You're up.
Take off.


148
00:13:42.516 --> 00:13:43.915
Hi.

149
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:46.949
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Randy.


150
00:13:48.856 --> 00:13:50.084
- Robin.
- Hi.


151
00:13:50.257 --> 00:13:51.485
What can I do for you?

152
00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:54.059
I was wondering...

153
00:13:56.764 --> 00:13:59.289
- You wanna go out with me sometime?
- What?


154
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.024
Well, you know, outside.

155
00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:03.159
I was in the van.

156
00:14:04.738 --> 00:14:06.262
I smiled.

157
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.907
You smiled.

158
00:14:08.108 --> 00:14:11.475
Wait a minute.
The guy in the van had a mustache.


159
00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:13.173
Right.

160
00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:16.276
What happened, I...

161
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.278
See, I wear this for my job.

162
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.248
Oh, my God.

163
00:14:22.723 --> 00:14:24.156
You're just a boy.

164
00:14:25.926 --> 00:14:28.827
I'm sorry. I don't date boys.

165
00:14:45.813 --> 00:14:49.249
For what it's worth, I think
she made a big mistake.


166
00:14:50.951 --> 00:14:55.388
Took a lot of nerve to go up to
a complete stranger and ask her out.


167
00:14:56.457 --> 00:14:58.015
I admire that.

168
00:14:58.358 --> 00:14:59.848
Thanks.

169
00:15:00.661 --> 00:15:03.027
I have to go kill myself now.
Excuse me.


170
00:15:03.197 --> 00:15:05.290
Don't take it so personally.

171
00:15:05.566 --> 00:15:08.535
Some women just have
limited perspective, that's all.


172
00:15:08.702 --> 00:15:11.000
She didn't even give me
a chance to talk.


173
00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:13.537
It was like I was younger,
so forget it.


174
00:15:13.841 --> 00:15:16.435
- Well, I know that was unfair.
- Yeah.


175
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.637
You know, I've never met a man who
shied away from 20-year-old girls.


176
00:15:21.315 --> 00:15:25.217
I don't see the difference, a few years.
It's no big deal.


177
00:15:25.719 --> 00:15:28.085
She's just kind of bitchy, that's all.

178
00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:29.721
Do you like clothes?

179
00:15:30.157 --> 00:15:31.522
Yes, yeah.

180
00:15:34.628 --> 00:15:36.118
Here.

181
00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:40.590
Oh, excuse me. It's okay.

182
00:15:40.767 --> 00:15:42.667
- Did that hurt?
- No, I'm hardheaded.


183
00:15:42.836 --> 00:15:45.566
Oh, dear. Here. 
Now, wait, look.

184
00:15:45.739 --> 00:15:48.867
These pads are very important
in this jacket.


185
00:15:49.042 --> 00:15:50.475
- All right.
- You see?


186
00:15:50.644 --> 00:15:52.043
- Yeah.
- Now.


187
00:15:52.479 --> 00:15:53.707
Yeah.

188
00:15:53.881 --> 00:15:55.212
There we are.

189
00:15:55.616 --> 00:15:57.106
Now.

190
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:04.054
Okay, hold on.

191
00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:17.102
- Oh, that looks wonderful.
- Think so? No, that's it.


192
00:16:17.371 --> 00:16:19.430
- Think that's okay?
- I think like this.


193
00:16:19.606 --> 00:16:23.303
- Oh, like that?
- There, you see? It should be like that.


194
00:16:23.844 --> 00:16:28.577
Oh, you look wonderful. Good enough
to go and have some cappuccino.


195
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:32.048
- Cappuccino?
- Would you like some cappuccino?


196
00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:34.211
Me?

197
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:36.716
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite you.

198
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.790
Not over coffee anyway.

199
00:16:39.026 --> 00:16:41.392
Are you-? Are you sure?

200
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:44.392
Okay. Yeah, okay.

201
00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:47.790
Oh, shit! I'm in a red zone.

202
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.404
Look, I really- See, I wanna-
Look, I gotta get back to work.


203
00:16:53.574 --> 00:16:57.237
See, I'm the only driver right now.
Well, thanks. Will I-?


204
00:16:57.578 --> 00:16:59.808
Will you-? Okay, bye.
Nice meeting you.


205
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:02.046
Bye.

206
00:17:03.183 --> 00:17:05.447
Hey, look, look. I'll move it.
I'll move it.


207
00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:10.386
Look. I got- Look. See,
I got a delivery. Come on.


208
00:17:11.191 --> 00:17:15.150
I had a letter to Penthouse staring me
right in the face, and I let it go.


209
00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.797
I mean, this was an incredibly
gorgeous woman.


210
00:17:17.965 --> 00:17:22.129
Not a girl, Sal, a woman.
A Chanel No. 5 woman-


211
00:17:22.302 --> 00:17:23.530
- Bodek!
- Yes.


212
00:17:23.704 --> 00:17:26.502
Got a delivery for Beverly Hills,
and the rest go...


213
00:17:26.673 --> 00:17:28.573
...to a stag party in Costa Mesa.

214
00:17:28.742 --> 00:17:32.803
- Extra anchovies?
- Costa Mesa? Why from here?


215
00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.278
All I know is they did,
so move your tail.


216
00:17:35.449 --> 00:17:37.349
I'm here to serve!

217
00:17:55.535 --> 00:17:57.662
Any luggage, sir?

218
00:17:58.205 --> 00:17:59.502
No, pizza.

219
00:17:59.673 --> 00:18:02.301
- Pizza.
- What's this?


220
00:18:08.682 --> 00:18:10.274
Excuse me.

221
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.398
Oh, excuse me.

222
00:18:43.316 --> 00:18:45.011
Señor Pizza.

223
00:18:50.157 --> 00:18:51.749
Come in.

224
00:18:55.295 --> 00:18:57.786
Can you put it on the table, please?

225
00:19:01.268 --> 00:19:02.701
Hi.

226
00:19:03.904 --> 00:19:05.371
Hi.

227
00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:09.774
I hope you didn't leave your car
in the red zone.


228
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.943
No.

229
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.814
- Please sit down.
- Yes, definitely.


230
00:19:16.316 --> 00:19:19.308
Oh, except, see, I got this
big delivery to make.


231
00:19:21.621 --> 00:19:23.555
In Costa Mesa?

232
00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:41.769
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.


233
00:19:41.942 --> 00:19:45.241
I'm at a friend's house, and I'm gonna
spend the night, okay?


234
00:19:45.412 --> 00:19:47.812
What? Whose?

235
00:19:48.682 --> 00:19:51.150
Just a guy from work, Dad.

236
00:19:54.287 --> 00:19:56.551
- What was that?
- What?


237
00:19:56.723 --> 00:19:58.452
- What was that?
- Nothing.


238
00:19:58.792 --> 00:20:00.259
- Randy?
- Yeah.


239
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.188
Dad, look, I'll see you
in the morning, okay?


240
00:20:03.363 --> 00:20:04.694
Yeah, sure, son.

241
00:20:13.173 --> 00:20:16.108
Randy's spending the night
at a friend's house.


242
00:20:16.777 --> 00:20:20.304
Well, he's not gonna come here.
He's miserable here.


243
00:20:21.715 --> 00:20:26.311
Diane, it's been over two weeks.
How long are you gonna keep this up?


244
00:20:26.486 --> 00:20:30.286
Joe, I don't know why you won't give
him one more chance at school.


245
00:20:30.957 --> 00:20:33.653
He's had all the chances
he's gonna get.


246
00:20:34.394 --> 00:20:38.125
I think he's really sorry.
Doesn't look like he's slept in days.


247
00:20:39.499 --> 00:20:41.091
So, Alex...?

248
00:20:41.434 --> 00:20:43.095
Yes, Randy?

249
00:20:43.403 --> 00:20:45.030
You work at Avedon?

250
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:48.440
I own Avedon, darling.

251
00:20:49.109 --> 00:20:52.943
- Actually, I own all 11 stores.
- Wow.


252
00:20:54.147 --> 00:20:56.012
Does that bother you?

253
00:20:56.683 --> 00:20:58.207
No, not at all.

254
00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:04.115
I'm glad, because it bothers
some people.


255
00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:05.519
Oh, like who?

256
00:21:06.326 --> 00:21:10.126
Some men find it very wilting.

257
00:21:10.764 --> 00:21:12.664
Not me.

258
00:21:14.901 --> 00:21:16.994
Can I ask you something?

259
00:21:17.537 --> 00:21:21.974
Now, you could just snap your fingers
and get any guy you wanted.


260
00:21:22.142 --> 00:21:25.407
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing here.


261
00:21:25.612 --> 00:21:27.603
I mean, you're just so...

262
00:21:29.716 --> 00:21:34.710
I came into town for a few days,
and when I saw you in the store...


263
00:21:36.723 --> 00:21:39.556
...I just thought you would be open.

264
00:21:40.527 --> 00:21:41.755
Open?

265
00:21:41.928 --> 00:21:44.658
Yes, I felt you knew
how to enjoy yourself.


266
00:22:06.553 --> 00:22:08.748
- Seven times?
- Yeah.


267
00:22:09.656 --> 00:22:12.216
Man, that is like wild boars
or something.


268
00:22:12.392 --> 00:22:15.520
Well... I mean,
that wasn't all we did.


269
00:22:15.996 --> 00:22:17.361
We talked about stuff.

270
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.294
Yeah, right. I mean,
I don't believe this.


271
00:22:20.467 --> 00:22:24.164
I mean, I come on to every girl
that walks, and they throw up.


272
00:22:24.337 --> 00:22:26.134
You do absolutely nothing...

273
00:22:26.306 --> 00:22:29.241
...and you get Miss "Take Me
From Behind on a Trapeze."


274
00:22:29.409 --> 00:22:31.741
Oh, no, no, no.
It was nothing like that.


275
00:22:31.912 --> 00:22:35.814
Oh, yeah, right. So you think you're
gonna hear from her again?


276
00:22:38.485 --> 00:22:40.112
Yeah.

277
00:22:49.729 --> 00:22:53.165
- Hi, what can I do for you?
- I come to see Randy.


278
00:22:53.566 --> 00:22:55.090
Randy. Really?

279
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.262
Somebody here to see you, son.

280
00:22:58.805 --> 00:23:01.865
- Thanks. Yeah, what's up?
- It's...


281
00:23:06.379 --> 00:23:08.279
Excuse me.

282
00:23:09.249 --> 00:23:12.309
These are beautiful, no?
It make you look very handsome.


283
00:23:12.485 --> 00:23:14.316
This is for me?

284
00:23:14.487 --> 00:23:17.479
It came to you at work,
so I bring it myself here.


285
00:23:17.958 --> 00:23:20.586
Is that the fourth one
this week, Tony?


286
00:23:21.594 --> 00:23:24.825
These American women, so
cheap and easy. All they say is:


287
00:23:24.998 --> 00:23:26.829
"Yes, Tony. Yes, Tony."

288
00:23:27.334 --> 00:23:29.996
You would rather have them say no?

289
00:23:30.203 --> 00:23:31.966
This I would respect.

290
00:23:32.639 --> 00:23:35.369
Well, thanks a lot.

291
00:23:40.447 --> 00:23:42.005
So...

292
00:23:42.215 --> 00:23:43.443
...who was that?

293
00:23:43.984 --> 00:23:45.212
Guy I work with.

294
00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:47.683
- The guy you were with last night?
- Yeah.


295
00:23:47.854 --> 00:23:49.116
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


296
00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:51.584
What's the story with the coat here?

297
00:23:51.758 --> 00:23:55.353
Oh, he outgrew it
and thought I might like it.


298
00:23:55.562 --> 00:23:57.359
Looks brand-new to me.

299
00:23:57.697 --> 00:24:00.894
Well, see, what happened was...

300
00:24:02.068 --> 00:24:04.628
What happened was that
he bought it on sale...


301
00:24:04.804 --> 00:24:07.034
...and it was the wrong size.

302
00:24:07.574 --> 00:24:08.973
Oh, I'll get it.

303
00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:10.867
You dropped a...

304
00:24:14.214 --> 00:24:15.681
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.


305
00:24:15.849 --> 00:24:17.646
- Sal, what's up?
- Listen.


306
00:24:17.817 --> 00:24:19.341
I just took a delivery order.

307
00:24:19.519 --> 00:24:23.478
Some woman asked for a large
Pizza Loco with extra anchovies...


308
00:24:23.656 --> 00:24:26.056
- ... and she wanted you personally.
- No!


309
00:24:26.226 --> 00:24:27.693
You're kidding.

310
00:24:27.894 --> 00:24:29.623
"Dear Randy...

311
00:24:29.963 --> 00:24:33.922
...of course, I prefer you naked...

312
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.828
...but if you must wear something,
it should be the best.


313
00:24:39.606 --> 00:24:41.096
Love...

314
00:24:41.374 --> 00:24:42.602
...Alex."

315
00:24:42.842 --> 00:24:44.833
- Diane?
- Yeah.


316
00:24:48.648 --> 00:24:50.240
- Yeah.
- Diane...


317
00:24:50.417 --> 00:24:51.850
...our son...

318
00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:53.382
...is a fruit!

319
00:24:53.553 --> 00:24:54.781
Yeah?

320
00:24:54.954 --> 00:24:57.445
All right, I'll be right there.
Thanks a lot.


321
00:24:58.491 --> 00:25:00.618
Mom! They need me at work.

322
00:25:00.794 --> 00:25:03.194
Oh, I thought you had
the afternoon off!


323
00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:07.022
- What's this?
- A guy shows up at the door...


324
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.998
...wearing enough cologne
to make me puke.


325
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.237
He gives our son a coat that
must cost 500 bucks-


326
00:25:13.406 --> 00:25:16.341
No, no, wait, don't-
Joe, don't jump to conclusions.


327
00:25:16.509 --> 00:25:18.568
See, the other driver called in sick.

328
00:25:18.745 --> 00:25:21.213
And they're already swamped
with deliveries.


329
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:23.849
- Don't hold dinner, I might be late.
- Okay.


330
00:25:24.017 --> 00:25:25.416
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.


331
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:32.758
He never brings girls home
to meet us.


332
00:25:33.693 --> 00:25:37.390
He never even talks
about girls anymore.


333
00:25:38.164 --> 00:25:41.827
- You think it happens to the other guy.
- Joe. Joe.


334
00:25:48.108 --> 00:25:50.338
I could get used to this.

335
00:25:51.277 --> 00:25:53.302
Oh, shit. Sorry.

336
00:25:53.646 --> 00:25:55.477
- That's all right.
- Okay.


337
00:25:57.917 --> 00:26:01.045
What I could do with you in Rome
in two months, Randy.


338
00:26:03.656 --> 00:26:05.351
What's wrong, darling?

339
00:26:06.292 --> 00:26:07.987
I think you should
know that-


340
00:26:08.161 --> 00:26:12.063
Alex, I love being with you
and everything. It's just...


341
00:26:12.632 --> 00:26:14.031
...I don't love you.

342
00:26:14.567 --> 00:26:17.400
- You don't?
- No. See, I've got this girl, Jenny.


343
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.367
- Yeah?
- Back at school.


344
00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:22.269
And we sort of broke up
and everything.


345
00:26:22.509 --> 00:26:24.306
But see, I'm gonna...

346
00:26:24.511 --> 00:26:27.639
- But I think I'm gonna-
- Randy?


347
00:26:27.914 --> 00:26:29.643
It's okay.

348
00:26:30.283 --> 00:26:32.183
I think I can handle it.

349
00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:37.189
Thanks, Alex.

350
00:26:51.704 --> 00:26:53.569
What's this?

351
00:26:54.607 --> 00:26:57.804
That's the Randy Bodek
Scholarship Fund.


352
00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:01.274
Oh, no. Alex.

353
00:27:02.115 --> 00:27:03.605
- I can't.
- Why not?


354
00:27:03.783 --> 00:27:06.308
Because it makes me feel...

355
00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:08.009
Randy.

356
00:27:09.155 --> 00:27:11.988
If I was the one who needed money...

357
00:27:12.358 --> 00:27:14.826
...and you had it to give...

358
00:27:15.595 --> 00:27:17.961
- ... would you give it to me?
- Yes.


359
00:27:18.231 --> 00:27:20.199
Of course you would.

360
00:27:20.833 --> 00:27:23.097
So, what's the difference?

361
00:27:36.683 --> 00:27:39.049
I'm never gonna see you again,
am I?


362
00:27:40.853 --> 00:27:43.287
Be on the lookout for extra anchovies.

363
00:28:01.507 --> 00:28:03.099
Randy?

364
00:28:14.053 --> 00:28:15.281
Joe.

365
00:28:15.455 --> 00:28:17.548
Jumping to conclusions,
am I, Diane?


366
00:28:17.724 --> 00:28:20.420
How dare you sneak home
in the middle of the day...


367
00:28:20.593 --> 00:28:23.061
- ... to invade your son's privacy.
- His privacy?


368
00:28:23.229 --> 00:28:26.528
- His sex life is his own business-
- Come on, Diane.


369
00:28:26.699 --> 00:28:29.259
Our son is dressing up
in ladies' underwear.


370
00:28:29.435 --> 00:28:32.165
- He needs professional help.
- No, he needs...


371
00:28:32.338 --> 00:28:34.772
...sympathetic parents who say
they love him.


372
00:28:34.941 --> 00:28:37.501
Let's see your sympathy when
he borrows makeup.


373
00:28:37.677 --> 00:28:39.440
- Oh, Joe.
- "Oh, Joe."


374
00:28:39.612 --> 00:28:41.204
Oh, God.

375
00:28:42.982 --> 00:28:45.143
Okay. Take the moon.

376
00:28:45.318 --> 00:28:46.876
It's a chunk of rock.

377
00:28:47.053 --> 00:28:49.112
Why does it spin around the Earth?

378
00:28:49.289 --> 00:28:51.723
Why doesn't it just bolt off into space?

379
00:28:52.158 --> 00:28:56.219
Smartest scientists don't understand
a billionth of what's going on.


380
00:28:56.396 --> 00:28:59.490
Why should I feel stupid
because I don't understand women?


381
00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:01.861
You get all that from
a cold pizza, man?


382
00:29:02.035 --> 00:29:07.132
- You're in worse shape than I thought.
- I'm serious. So I've saved 270 bucks?


383
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.308
I'm never gonna get Jenny back.

384
00:29:09.475 --> 00:29:13.241
- See, I don't know what to do.
- I do. Move your butt.


385
00:29:14.347 --> 00:29:16.645
Says "extra anchovies."
Who called it in?


386
00:29:16.816 --> 00:29:20.115
- What do you mean, who? Some lady.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.


387
00:29:20.286 --> 00:29:21.514
- Hold it.
- What?


388
00:29:21.688 --> 00:29:24.213
Where's your mustache?
I want mustaches worn.


389
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.915
- Sal said I didn't have to wear it.
- Sal.


390
00:29:27.093 --> 00:29:29.220
Mustaches, mustaches.

391
00:29:29.395 --> 00:29:31.386
You're bumming me out, man.

392
00:29:31.931 --> 00:29:33.159
Señor Pizza.

393
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.710
Alex?

394
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:14.239
- Hello.
- Hi.


395
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.934
I'm a friend of Alexandra.

396
00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.645
It's okay.

397
00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.312
What?

398
00:30:29.522 --> 00:30:30.921
Oh, no.

399
00:30:31.557 --> 00:30:33.582
I
- No.

400
00:30:46.105 --> 00:30:49.199
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

401
00:30:50.476 --> 00:30:52.034
It's nothing personal.

402
00:30:52.345 --> 00:30:56.008
- I want to die!
- Now, come on. Don't talk like that.


403
00:30:56.182 --> 00:30:59.174
Look, it's just been one giant mistake.

404
00:30:59.352 --> 00:31:02.719
Yes, my marriage.
Fourteen years of a big mistake.


405
00:31:02.889 --> 00:31:06.586
Hey, come on. It can't be that bad.
I mean, look at this house.


406
00:31:06.759 --> 00:31:08.158
What? It's great.

407
00:31:08.394 --> 00:31:10.157
It's a prison.

408
00:31:10.329 --> 00:31:12.092
Okay, why don't you
sit down here.


409
00:31:12.265 --> 00:31:14.927
You know, I hope everything
works out.


410
00:31:15.468 --> 00:31:17.936
No. No. No!

411
00:31:20.106 --> 00:31:23.303
When I was younger in Japan,
I had many boyfriends.


412
00:31:23.476 --> 00:31:27.344
Many proposals of marriage. But no,
I wanted to marry American.


413
00:31:28.114 --> 00:31:31.174
Be American woman with
American freedom and opportunity.


414
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.376
But my husband, he treats me
like a geisha.


415
00:31:34.554 --> 00:31:36.146
Well, I'm not a geisha!

416
00:31:38.257 --> 00:31:40.555
I'm a computer analyst!

417
00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:43.024
Look, I'm sorry,
but I gotta get going here.


418
00:31:43.196 --> 00:31:45.027
He treats me like his slave.

419
00:31:46.299 --> 00:31:47.664
And now...

420
00:31:47.834 --> 00:31:51.964
...when I finally get the courage
to do something for myself...


421
00:31:52.305 --> 00:31:55.001
...even you, professional,
you refuse me.


422
00:31:55.174 --> 00:31:57.802
- No, see, I'm not a professional.
- I want to die.


423
00:31:57.977 --> 00:31:59.444
Stop it.

424
00:32:01.347 --> 00:32:03.747
- No, no, no, no. Not like that.
- What?


425
00:32:03.916 --> 00:32:07.113
- That's my husband's way.
- I'm sorry, I thought that-


426
00:32:09.555 --> 00:32:11.523
I have a fantasy.

427
00:32:19.699 --> 00:32:21.257
Take me.

428
00:32:28.341 --> 00:32:30.036
Take me.

429
00:32:34.814 --> 00:32:37.009
- Take me!
- Yes, okay.


430
00:32:54.333 --> 00:32:56.426
Okay. It's all right.

431
00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:17.817
Yes, ma'am. Absolutely.
And thank you very much.


432
00:33:18.925 --> 00:33:24.261
Hey, Bodek, you are really quite
the popular guy, aren't you?


433
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.264
Look at this. Look at this.
You got a bunch of deliveries here.


434
00:33:28.434 --> 00:33:33.667
Hey, Juan! Break me out one of those
big cans of anchovies, will you?


435
00:33:36.676 --> 00:33:37.904
Oh, my goodness.

436
00:33:38.077 --> 00:33:41.444
- What the hell is going on?
- That last delivery wasn't Alex.


437
00:33:41.614 --> 00:33:46.017
I figured so. You got five more calls,
all women, all extra anchovies.


438
00:33:46.185 --> 00:33:49.882
Four of them scheduled deliveries
for later this week!


439
00:33:55.595 --> 00:33:59.395
I just couldn't say no.
Alex? She just insisted.


440
00:33:59.565 --> 00:34:02.466
And then Kyoko.
Kyoko, it was like...


441
00:34:02.635 --> 00:34:05.433
...I was defending the American way.

442
00:34:05.605 --> 00:34:07.539
It's taking me a second to get this.

443
00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:11.143
Beautiful women actually pay you
$200 apiece to sleep with them?


444
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.608
Yeah! I didn't want
to take their money.


445
00:34:13.779 --> 00:34:16.873
They were nice people.
They wouldn't take no for an answer.


446
00:34:17.049 --> 00:34:19.074
Okay, well, what about the others?

447
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:21.947
Call them back and say
there are no more anchovies.


448
00:34:22.121 --> 00:34:25.648
I can't! They didn't leave names
or numbers, only addresses.


449
00:34:25.825 --> 00:34:27.986
Three of them are motels
in the Valley.


450
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.594
I cannot believe Alex
would do this to me.


451
00:34:30.763 --> 00:34:34.597
Who knows? Right now your name
and number could be on every wall...


452
00:34:34.767 --> 00:34:37.861
...of every ladies' room
from Chinoise to Le Dôme, man.


453
00:34:38.704 --> 00:34:41.434
You could be the love doctor
of Beverly Hills!


454
00:34:42.108 --> 00:34:44.804
I don't wanna be the love doctor
of Beverly Hills!


455
00:34:44.977 --> 00:34:47.537
- You're going.
- I am not going.


456
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.848
No.

457
00:34:51.517 --> 00:34:55.817
What do you think, Joe?
Portable home-security systems.


458
00:34:55.988 --> 00:35:00.254
I pick them up in Tokyo for a buck
and a quarter, sell them here for $40.


459
00:35:00.426 --> 00:35:02.257
Ain't that something?

460
00:35:02.862 --> 00:35:05.194
It's great. It's really great.

461
00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:10.358
I got 20,000 of these waiting to go into
the warehouse as soon as you build it.


462
00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:12.766
- Right. Right.
- Excuse me, Mr. Bodek.


463
00:35:12.938 --> 00:35:15.168
- Yes, Linda?
- Mr. Rubelinski's calling.


464
00:35:15.341 --> 00:35:17.400
Tell him I'll call him back.

465
00:35:17.576 --> 00:35:21.239
Excuse me. Do you mind if I spend
the night in your trailer tonight?


466
00:35:21.414 --> 00:35:24.315
They're painting my apartment,
and the fumes are-


467
00:35:24.717 --> 00:35:26.150
No problem.

468
00:35:26.919 --> 00:35:30.355
Look, Linda, you sure
you'll be safe down here?


469
00:35:30.523 --> 00:35:33.014
Yeah. I can take care of myself.

470
00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:38.028
Hey, that's not bad. Porking her?

471
00:35:39.799 --> 00:35:42.529
I'm a happily married man, Harry.

472
00:35:43.369 --> 00:35:45.394
At least, I used to be.

473
00:35:46.072 --> 00:35:49.132
Does this kid look
like a fruit to you?

474
00:35:50.743 --> 00:35:53.303
You can't tell these days.

475
00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.340
I think I'm entitled to be
a little concerned here.


476
00:35:57.516 --> 00:36:00.246
I've tried to talk to the wife.
She won't listen.


477
00:36:00.419 --> 00:36:04.947
Shit. You never get treated
that way with an Oriental woman.


478
00:36:05.124 --> 00:36:07.149
Great sex.

479
00:36:07.326 --> 00:36:08.657
No lip.

480
00:36:08.828 --> 00:36:10.227
I'm married to one.

481
00:36:10.396 --> 00:36:12.159
- Yeah?
- Damn right.


482
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:16.294
I heard this story once
from this guy back in New York.


483
00:36:16.469 --> 00:36:20.200
This guy was late for work,
and he sees his bus leaving the stop.


484
00:36:20.372 --> 00:36:22.806
His Oriental wife runs
into the street...


485
00:36:22.975 --> 00:36:26.308
...jumps right in front of it
and stops it for him.


486
00:36:27.546 --> 00:36:31.107
That's what marriage is all about,
you ask me.


487
00:36:33.619 --> 00:36:35.746
What happened to the wife?

488
00:36:38.023 --> 00:36:39.251
What?

489
00:36:39.425 --> 00:36:42.553
The wife.
When she jumped in front of the bus.


490
00:36:45.531 --> 00:36:48.159
You're never gonna get it, are you?

491
00:36:54.273 --> 00:36:58.937
I want another chance.
My life is a mess without you.


492
00:36:59.111 --> 00:37:00.874
Yeah, I know.

493
00:37:01.213 --> 00:37:03.545
I'm not ashamed of you.

494
00:37:04.083 --> 00:37:05.880
I'm proud.

495
00:37:06.352 --> 00:37:08.320
I'm gonna tell my parents about you.

496
00:37:08.487 --> 00:37:13.550
I want them to meet you. Their 20th
anniversary is at the end of the month.


497
00:37:13.726 --> 00:37:15.660
And what about your father?

498
00:37:15.828 --> 00:37:20.288
I don't care what my father thinks.
I know my mom's gonna love you.


499
00:37:23.068 --> 00:37:27.402
Look, just don't say no
until you think about it.


500
00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:02.104
Oh, no.

501
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.602
Mr. Bodek.

502
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.772
Mr. Bodek?

503
00:38:12.184 --> 00:38:17.144
Mr. Bodek, you can't stay here.
You've gotta go.


504
00:38:17.323 --> 00:38:18.813
Oh, God.

505
00:38:19.658 --> 00:38:21.626
Please? Please wake up.

506
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.095
Mom?

507
00:38:27.132 --> 00:38:29.896
What are you doing up?
Where's Dad?


508
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:33.869
- I don't know. We had a fight.
- About me?


509
00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:35.904
Mom, I'm sorry.

510
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.813
Don't worry.

511
00:38:42.982 --> 00:38:46.645
You know, I bet he just crashed out
on the sofa bed at the office.


512
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.948
Yeah, you're probably right.

513
00:38:54.593 --> 00:38:57.426
- Good night.
- Okay, good night.


514
00:39:05.504 --> 00:39:07.369
Oh, Diane...

515
00:39:10.643 --> 00:39:12.440
- Linda!
- Mr. Bodek?


516
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:13.942
What are you doing here?

517
00:39:14.113 --> 00:39:16.547
I told you they're painting
my place, remember?


518
00:39:16.715 --> 00:39:21.675
- No! Oh, my head. It's killing-
- I'm sorry.


519
00:39:21.854 --> 00:39:25.813
- Linda, we didn't, you know-?
- No, you came in here.


520
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:28.482
- I couldn't even move you.
- Thank God!


521
00:39:28.827 --> 00:39:32.490
Listen, nobody will believe
that we just slept here.


522
00:39:32.665 --> 00:39:34.826
- Yeah, no-
- No, it's okay.


523
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.365
- It's okay.
- It's okay.


524
00:39:36.535 --> 00:39:39.265
There's nobody here yet.
We're safe. We're safe.


525
00:39:39.438 --> 00:39:42.839
We're safe as long as we don't
ever let anybody know about this.


526
00:39:43.008 --> 00:39:44.339
- I won't.
- Ever. Okay?


527
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.570
- Okay, I won't say a word. I promise.
- Okay.


528
00:39:47.813 --> 00:39:49.781
- No! Don't!
- Mr. Bodek's office.


529
00:39:51.116 --> 00:39:52.208
Linda?

530
00:39:53.819 --> 00:39:55.411
It's your wife!

531
00:40:02.962 --> 00:40:04.224
Hey, Bodek!

532
00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:07.289
Look who's here.

533
00:40:07.666 --> 00:40:10.260
Goofing off on the job, huh?

534
00:40:11.303 --> 00:40:15.262
- What do you want, Jory?
- I wanna give you my order, Rander.


535
00:40:19.411 --> 00:40:21.879
I'll have a Taco Macho.

536
00:40:22.915 --> 00:40:25.975
Extra lettuce. Extra cheese.

537
00:40:26.151 --> 00:40:27.982
A large Coke.

538
00:40:28.153 --> 00:40:30.519
And Jenny's phone number.

539
00:40:31.357 --> 00:40:35.054
You'll never get back to school.
I might as well get a hop on it.


540
00:40:35.227 --> 00:40:39.596
- Listen, asshole, stay away from her.
- Go ahead, no-dick. Take a shot.


541
00:40:39.765 --> 00:40:42.996
Come on, mellow out.
Take a number and sit down.


542
00:40:43.168 --> 00:40:45.636
- You just lost your tip.
- Geek.


543
00:40:47.539 --> 00:40:53.000
Let's see, 9000 plus the 400
you just made, divided by 200...


544
00:40:53.178 --> 00:40:57.114
- What are you doing?
- Let's see, that's only 43 women.


545
00:41:39.324 --> 00:41:42.589
- Señor Pizza.
- It's about time.


546
00:41:51.003 --> 00:41:52.470
Sorry.

547
00:41:53.272 --> 00:41:54.796
Put it down.

548
00:41:55.574 --> 00:41:58.236
Not on the plant.

549
00:42:06.418 --> 00:42:07.749
So?

550
00:42:08.687 --> 00:42:10.177
So...

551
00:42:15.327 --> 00:42:17.955
You want me to fix you a drink
or something?


552
00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.395
If I wanted a drink,
I would have hired a bartender.


553
00:42:21.567 --> 00:42:23.694
- Could you help me with this?
- Sure.


554
00:42:31.176 --> 00:42:32.700
- Shit.
- What's the matter?


555
00:42:32.878 --> 00:42:34.175
Hang on.

556
00:42:37.483 --> 00:42:40.213
Don't move.
My lip is caught in the zipper.


557
00:42:40.385 --> 00:42:43.286
- What?
- My lip is caught in the zipper.


558
00:42:43.455 --> 00:42:45.514
I don't believe this.

559
00:42:46.925 --> 00:42:51.862
Good God! What kind
of a professional lover are you?


560
00:42:54.733 --> 00:42:57.395
Just
- Just take your clothes off.

561
00:43:42.948 --> 00:43:46.384
- Are you crazy? People can see!
- Fine. I want them to.


562
00:43:46.552 --> 00:43:50.318
Look, if something's bothering you,
maybe this isn't the best time.


563
00:43:50.489 --> 00:43:54.653
If something's bothering me?
Of course something's bothering me!


564
00:43:54.826 --> 00:43:56.691
- Do you know what this is?
- Looks-


565
00:43:56.862 --> 00:43:58.853
Wrong! It's my husband's beeper.

566
00:43:59.097 --> 00:44:02.624
Have you heard of him?
Dr. Reed Palmer?


567
00:44:02.801 --> 00:44:07.761
I thought the son of a bitch was a saint
with all his late-night emergency calls.


568
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:13.877
I found out he's been screwing some
nympho RN on the graveyard shift!


569
00:44:14.446 --> 00:44:17.472
Hey, hey, come on. Calm down.

570
00:44:18.884 --> 00:44:21.717
You know, two can play at this game.

571
00:44:21.887 --> 00:44:24.583
- You wait till I tell my husband.
- Your husband?


572
00:44:24.756 --> 00:44:26.587
- Come on.
- You can't do it.


573
00:44:45.877 --> 00:44:47.105
Oh, God.

574
00:44:48.747 --> 00:44:52.547
- Is this okay?
- Oh, good. It's really good.


575
00:44:52.718 --> 00:44:55.846
- Oh, it feels weird.
- Doesn't feel weird to me.


576
00:44:56.021 --> 00:44:58.888
- You sure?
- You're great at this.


577
00:44:59.057 --> 00:45:00.456
Thanks.

578
00:45:02.694 --> 00:45:04.286
- Joyce?
- Yes?


579
00:45:04.463 --> 00:45:07.626
Now, how did you get my number?

580
00:45:07.799 --> 00:45:11.200
- Oh, at my salon, why?
- Your sal-?


581
00:45:13.572 --> 00:45:14.937
I'm sorry.

582
00:45:15.107 --> 00:45:17.940
It's all right.
I'm a little rusty myself.


583
00:45:19.111 --> 00:45:24.481
- You really like dancing to this stuff?
- Yeah, sure. A lot of women do.


584
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:29.384
You know, if you learned, I bet
your clients would really appreciate it.


585
00:45:29.554 --> 00:45:32.352
You know, Reed hasn't
taken me dancing-


586
00:45:32.991 --> 00:45:35.255
Since we were in med school.

587
00:45:36.261 --> 00:45:39.230
I know this is probably
against your professional code...


588
00:45:39.398 --> 00:45:41.298
...but can I ask
a personal question?


589
00:45:41.466 --> 00:45:42.694
Sure.

590
00:45:42.868 --> 00:45:45.860
It's just that this isn't
what I imagined.


591
00:45:46.038 --> 00:45:48.802
I was angry, and I wanted
to get back at my husband.


592
00:45:48.974 --> 00:45:51.169
And I guess I kind of expected
a sort of:


593
00:45:51.343 --> 00:45:53.903
"Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am."

594
00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:56.138
- But you're not like that at all.
- No.


595
00:45:58.617 --> 00:46:01.211
Hey, I'm having a great time!

596
00:46:02.688 --> 00:46:04.280
You're worth every penny.

597
00:46:25.944 --> 00:46:27.172
Honey!

598
00:46:28.146 --> 00:46:29.875
I'm home!

599
00:46:33.685 --> 00:46:36.017
We really need to talk, son.

600
00:46:36.988 --> 00:46:38.512
Hi, sweetheart.

601
00:46:38.957 --> 00:46:42.723
Honey, I got you some flowers,
and I just thought we could talk-


602
00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:46.593
Two, three, four.

603
00:46:49.434 --> 00:46:51.402
Six, seven, eight.

604
00:47:02.514 --> 00:47:05.176
One, two, three, four.

605
00:47:07.452 --> 00:47:09.420
Five, six, seven.

606
00:47:13.658 --> 00:47:15.250
Hey, son!

607
00:47:15.427 --> 00:47:19.420
Thought you might want to check out
the annual football issue.


608
00:47:22.033 --> 00:47:23.591
Look, smell.

609
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:25.593
No, smell it.

610
00:47:25.771 --> 00:47:29.571
It's got a nice smell to it.
I kind of like it.


611
00:47:29.908 --> 00:47:31.466
Hey, catch!

612
00:47:31.843 --> 00:47:34.175
Hey, you still got it.

613
00:47:39.351 --> 00:47:40.943
Sad.

614
00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:43.087
Really, very sad.

615
00:47:43.622 --> 00:47:45.852
Jen? Yeah.

616
00:47:46.725 --> 00:47:52.357
Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what you said back at school.


617
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:55.828
About how I don't know how
to treat a woman.


618
00:47:56.568 --> 00:47:58.058
Well...

619
00:47:58.537 --> 00:48:00.198
...you're right.

620
00:48:02.007 --> 00:48:03.804
But I am working on it.

621
00:48:04.543 --> 00:48:06.135
Okay, I got it.

622
00:48:19.424 --> 00:48:21.517
Oh, man!

623
00:48:23.161 --> 00:48:24.389
Excuse me.

624
00:48:33.538 --> 00:48:37.941
So how have you been?
It's good to see you. Okay...


625
00:48:42.214 --> 00:48:43.511
Sorry.

626
00:48:44.516 --> 00:48:45.778
Excuse me.

627
00:49:15.146 --> 00:49:19.139
This is the best part right here.
Get ready for this.


628
00:50:13.605 --> 00:50:16.699
I tried EST,
and I shared all that I could.


629
00:50:16.875 --> 00:50:18.433
Then I bought the crystals.

630
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:22.603
Finally, I tried channeling,
so I find out who I am 1000 years ago.


631
00:50:22.781 --> 00:50:25.113
But I need to
know who I am today.

632
00:50:47.706 --> 00:50:51.437
And don't forget to order
extra anchovy.


633
00:52:12.724 --> 00:52:15.557
Please think about coming over
to my parents'...


634
00:52:15.727 --> 00:52:17.820
...for the anniversary next week.

635
00:52:18.196 --> 00:52:20.664
Come on.
At least pick up the phone.


636
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.067
Okay.

637
00:52:24.536 --> 00:52:26.504
But I still love you.

638
00:52:26.838 --> 00:52:28.271
Bye-bye.

639
00:52:38.583 --> 00:52:40.813
So how are we doing?

640
00:52:40.985 --> 00:52:44.352
Well, less expenses, which is...

641
00:52:44.522 --> 00:52:47.616
- ... $6879.32.
- Hey, that's not bad.


642
00:52:47.792 --> 00:52:51.489
It's gonna get a lot better too.
We now take all major credit cards.


643
00:52:51.663 --> 00:52:52.960
- What?
- Oh, come on.


644
00:52:53.131 --> 00:52:55.292
These women haven't touched cash
in years.


645
00:52:55.467 --> 00:52:59.801
Now they don't have to go to the bank
or explain mysterious withdrawals.


646
00:52:59.971 --> 00:53:01.199
There'll be a record.

647
00:53:01.372 --> 00:53:04.034
Charged to Señor Pizza.
The bridge club ordered in.


648
00:53:04.209 --> 00:53:06.643
- I don't like it.
- I do the books at the store.


649
00:53:06.811 --> 00:53:07.835
Who's gonna know?

650
00:53:08.012 --> 00:53:10.606
Hold on, let me just get-

651
00:53:10.782 --> 00:53:12.682
Looks good.

652
00:53:18.923 --> 00:53:20.754
Stop it.

653
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:31.566
Don't stop.

654
00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:13.702
- Hi.
- Hi.


655
00:54:13.878 --> 00:54:17.575
Señor Pizza, with extra anchovies.

656
00:54:17.749 --> 00:54:20.217
Great. Right here is fine.

657
00:54:22.353 --> 00:54:23.820
Right here?

658
00:54:26.558 --> 00:54:28.321
Well, sure.

659
00:54:31.996 --> 00:54:34.692
Leslie! Julie!

660
00:54:34.899 --> 00:54:36.696
Come on, kids! Pizza's here.

661
00:54:36.868 --> 00:54:38.426
Get the extra anchovies, Mom?

662
00:54:38.603 --> 00:54:40.798
Well, I sure did. Come on.

663
00:54:46.244 --> 00:54:47.939
So you did these, huh?

664
00:54:48.279 --> 00:54:51.442
- What are they, mountains?
- Anatomical landscapes.


665
00:54:51.616 --> 00:54:54.551
That one's a shoulder.
That one is a neck.


666
00:54:54.719 --> 00:54:57.517
That's a bicep,
the one with the egg there.


667
00:54:57.755 --> 00:54:59.052
Another shoulder.

668
00:54:59.224 --> 00:55:02.352
- So these are all parts of a guy?
- They're my husband.


669
00:55:02.594 --> 00:55:06.826
He's a bodybuilder.
Mr. California Olympian '84.


670
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:13.200
So does he still look like that?

671
00:55:13.638 --> 00:55:17.039
No. He's much bigger now.

672
00:55:18.676 --> 00:55:20.439
Look, maybe I shouldn't be here.

673
00:55:20.612 --> 00:55:25.914
Don't worry. He won't be home
for hours. He's into private instruction.


674
00:55:26.384 --> 00:55:28.716
Very private.

675
00:55:31.489 --> 00:55:33.150
I'm sorry.

676
00:55:33.858 --> 00:55:37.726
All day, he works on starlets
with little Barbie-doll hard bodies.


677
00:55:37.896 --> 00:55:40.160
Why should he want to
come home to this?


678
00:55:40.331 --> 00:55:42.026
I would come home.

679
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:48.002
No, you should see these girls. All
they do is eat kelp and drink spritzers.


680
00:55:48.339 --> 00:55:50.830
And here I am
with my cigarette and my drink.


681
00:55:51.042 --> 00:55:54.409
I can't help it if I like a shot
of tequila once in a while.


682
00:55:54.579 --> 00:55:57.514
I like actual food, not fiber.

683
00:55:57.682 --> 00:56:02.881
Fuck fiber. I want grease, red meat.
I got pork chops hidden in the freezer.


684
00:56:04.022 --> 00:56:09.119
And my husband's in the perfect-body
business. It's like a joke.


685
00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:12.289
- Maybe he likes you the way you are.
- Yeah, right.


686
00:56:12.463 --> 00:56:15.955
Wanna see what he got me
for my birthday?


687
00:56:20.204 --> 00:56:21.831
Is that, like, a hint or what?

688
00:56:22.707 --> 00:56:25.767
Well, I don't think that was a hint.

689
00:56:27.545 --> 00:56:31.777
- Okay, smile.
- Oh, no. Please. Please.


690
00:56:32.317 --> 00:56:35.514
National Cellulite Contest
isn't until next week, okay?


691
00:56:35.853 --> 00:56:37.150
That's good.

692
00:56:38.289 --> 00:56:41.156
Smile. Oh, so sexy.

693
00:56:47.432 --> 00:56:49.457
- Yes. And how foolish-
- Great.


694
00:56:49.667 --> 00:56:52.363
Okay, relax and releasing
into the photo experience.


695
00:56:52.537 --> 00:56:55.563
And breathe and say yes
to the photo experience.


696
00:56:57.875 --> 00:57:00.742
Don't make me look vulnerable.
Forbidden quality.


697
00:57:00.912 --> 00:57:02.743
Certain dignity. Anything?

698
00:57:08.186 --> 00:57:11.678
- A pastrami burrito, nachos alfredo-
- Hey!


699
00:57:11.856 --> 00:57:13.721
A Diet Coke.

700
00:57:17.862 --> 00:57:19.420
Randy Bodek?

701
00:57:21.733 --> 00:57:23.758
You been messing with my wife?

702
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:34.571
Multiple fractures,
internal hemorrhaging.


703
00:57:34.746 --> 00:57:37.772
- We need immediate x-rays.
- It's too late for that!


704
00:57:46.758 --> 00:57:49.386
We've got to open him right up.

705
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:53.825
Whatever you say, Dr. Palmer.

706
00:57:53.998 --> 00:57:57.297
- Dr. Palmer. Dr. Reed Palmer?
- That's right, Randy.


707
00:57:59.804 --> 00:58:01.795
I believe you know my wife.

708
00:58:02.974 --> 00:58:04.441
No anesthetic!

709
00:58:10.648 --> 00:58:14.778
- We need 12 units of BHT.
- And we need a bucket for the blood.


710
00:58:16.788 --> 00:58:20.246
- All right, flash cards, everybody.
- Flash cards in place.


711
00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:37.599
- Hello?
- Hi, honey!


712
00:58:37.842 --> 00:58:39.207
Joe.

713
00:58:40.111 --> 00:58:44.070
- Is it raining?
- Yeah, we got a shower going here.


714
00:58:46.784 --> 00:58:48.081
Joe, who was that?

715
00:58:49.187 --> 00:58:52.645
- Think you could foot the bill?
- He couldn't handle the two of us.


716
00:58:52.824 --> 00:58:54.485
Oh, just a couple of hookers.

717
00:58:55.226 --> 00:58:57.126
Look, I don't know what time-

718
00:59:14.479 --> 00:59:17.107
Well, I can't find anything
physically wrong.


719
00:59:17.281 --> 00:59:20.808
Joyce, I'm not making this up.
I have pains in my chest.


720
00:59:20.985 --> 00:59:22.782
I know you're not making this up.

721
00:59:22.987 --> 00:59:25.012
I think it's caused from stress.

722
00:59:25.223 --> 00:59:28.886
Have you been upset or had
emotional problems lately?


723
00:59:31.996 --> 00:59:34.829
I can't believe it, right before
our 20th anniversary.


724
00:59:34.999 --> 00:59:38.059
How am I going to get through
that party when I know?


725
00:59:39.904 --> 00:59:42.395
And it isn't just his secretary.

726
00:59:42.573 --> 00:59:45.167
This time, he admitted
he was with hookers.


727
00:59:45.409 --> 00:59:48.537
And I swear, the son of a bitch
called from a shower stall.


728
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.307
Well, at least my husband has
the brains to invent some excuse.


729
00:59:53.484 --> 00:59:55.452
I mean, we had
our ups and downs...


730
00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.815
...just like everybody else.

731
00:59:59.023 --> 01:00:02.151
But we were happy.
I know we were.


732
01:00:02.793 --> 01:00:04.658
How about sexually?

733
01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:09.129
Great. Great, you know,
until recently.


734
01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.858
Oh, God, it's all my fault.

735
01:00:12.036 --> 01:00:14.869
That your husband is having affairs?
Diane.


736
01:00:15.039 --> 01:00:18.031
Joyce!
What am I gonna do?


737
01:00:18.609 --> 01:00:20.338
I know what you're going through.

738
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:22.843
Believe me,
I know what you're going through.


739
01:00:23.848 --> 01:00:25.975
What is that? A prescription?

740
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:28.275
Kind of.

741
01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:36.255
Penny for them?

742
01:00:36.594 --> 01:00:37.891
Nothing.

743
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:43.066
- I've been having nightmares.
- About what?


744
01:00:43.234 --> 01:00:45.794
- Husbands.
- Me too.


745
01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:49.497
No. I mean, like,
maybe I shouldn't be doing this.


746
01:00:49.807 --> 01:00:51.331
Randy.

747
01:00:51.776 --> 01:00:54.745
- Nobody's going to find out.
- Yeah, well.


748
01:00:55.012 --> 01:00:56.980
- You parked in the back, right?
- Yeah.


749
01:00:57.148 --> 01:01:01.778
Besides, Harry never comes home.
He's downtown all day. Every day.


750
01:01:03.988 --> 01:01:05.580
Kyoko?

751
01:01:06.591 --> 01:01:08.559
God, it's Harry!

752
01:01:13.698 --> 01:01:15.165
Pumpkin!

753
01:01:15.733 --> 01:01:17.394
Where you at?

754
01:01:18.202 --> 01:01:19.794
- Harry.
- I don't believe it.


755
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:24.772
I got 1000 crates of those
talking robots, sitting on the dock!


756
01:01:26.677 --> 01:01:29.339
I just find out I lost a week
on the warehouse.


757
01:01:29.513 --> 01:01:30.775
Oh, no.

758
01:01:31.415 --> 01:01:33.474
City forgot to inform us...

759
01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:37.348
...there's a little water main that
goes right through my goddamn lot.


760
01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:39.682
- I'm so sorry.
- That doesn't help.


761
01:01:47.765 --> 01:01:50.199
I'll get you something to eat.
Are you hungry?


762
01:01:50.368 --> 01:01:53.531
Wish I could take a bath
in the middle of the afternoon.


763
01:02:01.946 --> 01:02:03.413
Harry.

764
01:02:03.948 --> 01:02:05.438
Harry.

765
01:02:14.959 --> 01:02:16.688
I know something's wrong.

766
01:02:22.933 --> 01:02:25.424
You've been acting strange for weeks.

767
01:02:25.736 --> 01:02:27.863
You've been too freaking cheerful.

768
01:02:35.212 --> 01:02:37.976
I always use rose petals in my bath.

769
01:02:38.249 --> 01:02:39.841
Since when?

770
01:02:44.188 --> 01:02:45.485
Harry.

771
01:02:46.023 --> 01:02:47.923
Let me fix you a drink.

772
01:02:52.663 --> 01:02:54.631
Intruder! Intruder!

773
01:02:54.799 --> 01:02:56.790
Trespasser! Trespasser!

774
01:02:56.967 --> 01:02:59.993
Bad boy! Bad boy!

775
01:03:00.171 --> 01:03:02.366
Very bad! Very bad boy!

776
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:09.010
I'm pissed on you!

777
01:03:09.547 --> 01:03:11.606
Pissed on you, boy!

778
01:03:11.782 --> 01:03:13.943
Hey, is somebody up there?

779
01:03:14.118 --> 01:03:15.710
Of course not.

780
01:03:16.187 --> 01:03:18.382
Don't you want your gin and tonic?

781
01:03:19.023 --> 01:03:20.251
Harry.

782
01:03:20.424 --> 01:03:24.758
Baby, baby, baby. What's the matter?
Why are you crying?


783
01:03:46.817 --> 01:03:48.876
Intruder alert! Trespasser!

784
01:03:49.887 --> 01:03:51.411
Intruder alert!

785
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:53.750
Intruder alert! Trespasser!

786
01:03:56.794 --> 01:03:59.729
Trespasser! Bad boy!

787
01:03:59.897 --> 01:04:02.422
Bad dude! Bad dude!

788
01:04:06.036 --> 01:04:09.494
Those things go off all the time!
Face it, Harry. They're junk.


789
01:04:09.673 --> 01:04:12.801
Junk! Harry Bruckner
does not buy junk!


790
01:04:13.344 --> 01:04:16.279
Now, where is your guy?
He's in there, huh?


791
01:04:18.516 --> 01:04:20.313
Your storeroom.
How should I know?


792
01:04:20.484 --> 01:04:22.179
Never mind.

793
01:04:22.353 --> 01:04:25.322
There's other ways of finding out
who your guy is.


794
01:04:25.489 --> 01:04:30.256
Probably one of your old boyfriends.
There's the one from Yokohama...


795
01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:45.408
Harry!

796
01:04:46.143 --> 01:04:49.601
- You have no right!
- Right!


797
01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.840
Well, he's not here now.
But he was here today, wasn't he?


798
01:04:53.017 --> 01:04:56.453
Mr. Rose-on-the-Pillow.
Let me see that.


799
01:04:59.423 --> 01:05:03.860
Two-hour appointment with Dr. Palmer
this morning. House call. Right?


800
01:05:04.028 --> 01:05:07.828
I knew that son of a bitch
was porking his patients. I knew it!


801
01:05:09.366 --> 01:05:11.027
Goodbye, Harry.

802
01:05:14.805 --> 01:05:17.501
Relax, Mr. Chapman.

803
01:05:17.675 --> 01:05:20.235
You're in good hands
with Dr. Palmer.


804
01:05:20.411 --> 01:05:22.936
Haven't had any complaints yet.

805
01:05:23.113 --> 01:05:24.341
Have we, Darlene?

806
01:05:24.715 --> 01:05:27.309
Son of a bitch!

807
01:05:27.985 --> 01:05:30.852
You son of a bitch!

808
01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:36.986
Move it! Get out of my way!

809
01:05:37.161 --> 01:05:40.619
I didn't know Darlene was married.
She never told me.


810
01:05:41.332 --> 01:05:43.926
Who the hell is Darlene?

811
01:05:52.476 --> 01:05:55.445
- Fred Astaire tipped me off.
- What?


812
01:05:55.779 --> 01:05:57.508
Joyce used to love to go dancing.

813
01:05:57.681 --> 01:06:00.309
Something was up when
I saw those old records out.


814
01:06:00.484 --> 01:06:04.215
- The roses in her dresser were the-
- Roses. You too?


815
01:06:04.388 --> 01:06:06.356
This guy's got some line of bullshit.

816
01:06:06.524 --> 01:06:08.583
How come you didn't
give it to her then?


817
01:06:08.759 --> 01:06:11.592
I don't know. I'd been fooling
around with Darlene.


818
01:06:11.762 --> 01:06:14.856
- I figured maybe it was only fair.
- Bullshit.


819
01:06:15.032 --> 01:06:18.092
Right! Bullshit!

820
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:21.870
There. There it is. Right there.

821
01:06:22.039 --> 01:06:25.372
See, I noticed she gets
these roses every Tuesday.


822
01:06:25.543 --> 01:06:27.841
That's the day this joker comes by.

823
01:06:28.012 --> 01:06:30.242
Personal fitness trainer.

824
01:06:31.148 --> 01:06:33.582
Let's get that bastard.

825
01:06:38.422 --> 01:06:41.186
Come on out here!

826
01:06:41.358 --> 01:06:44.486
You have been porking my wife!

827
01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.761
I see them moving around in there.
Come on out, little weasel!


828
01:06:57.541 --> 01:06:59.702
All right.

829
01:07:12.423 --> 01:07:16.018
Great! This is all I need.

830
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.792
You guys are robbing my house.

831
01:07:18.963 --> 01:07:21.295
My wife's having an affair.

832
01:07:22.166 --> 01:07:23.633
What the hell?

833
01:07:24.501 --> 01:07:26.196
Go ahead.

834
01:07:27.438 --> 01:07:28.803
Buddy?

835
01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.199
Big, big buddy?

836
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:35.304
Your wife is having an affair?

837
01:07:55.399 --> 01:07:58.562
"Extra anchovies."

838
01:08:08.479 --> 01:08:11.880
- Randy, what is wrong?
- Tony.


839
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:16.213
A lot of these girls you've been seeing,
they've got boyfriends, don't they?


840
01:08:16.387 --> 01:08:20.016
- Of course. Husbands sometimes.
- Well, have any of them found out...


841
01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:22.681
- ... and came after you or anything?
- Of course.


842
01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:27.092
In Genova, a husband come
after me with a butcher knife.


843
01:08:27.264 --> 01:08:32.258
We fight. We fight, and I hit him
to the ground. I bite his ear off.


844
01:08:32.436 --> 01:08:34.165
He don't bother me no more.

845
01:08:34.338 --> 01:08:35.669
Great.

846
01:08:35.839 --> 01:08:38.603
Wilshire Motel? Extra anchovies?
No problem. Enjoy-


847
01:08:38.776 --> 01:08:42.837
No, no! There's a husband out there
who wants to kill me. I wanna retire!


848
01:08:43.013 --> 01:08:44.480
- Hold it!
- What?


849
01:08:44.648 --> 01:08:49.108
Listen, you're exactly one romantic
interlude away from the jackpot.


850
01:08:49.286 --> 01:08:52.585
- One?
- Do you have one left in you? One!


851
01:08:53.223 --> 01:08:54.815
One. One, yes.

852
01:08:54.992 --> 01:08:57.119
Forty-three!
Seventy-six, hike. Go!


853
01:09:18.916 --> 01:09:22.613
Here you go, Mrs. Smith, Room 214.
Other side of the pool.


854
01:09:22.786 --> 01:09:24.583
Thank you.

855
01:09:42.539 --> 01:09:43.767
Hello?

856
01:09:44.808 --> 01:09:46.776
Are you Sal?

857
01:09:48.178 --> 01:09:50.442
- Yeah.
- I'm Jenny.


858
01:09:50.614 --> 01:09:53.777
Oh, Randy's Jenny?
I thought you were in Santa Barbara.


859
01:09:53.951 --> 01:09:56.283
Randy invited me to his parents' party.

860
01:09:56.453 --> 01:09:59.854
- I thought you guys broke up.
- Well, we did but...


861
01:10:00.524 --> 01:10:02.958
He's not seeing anybody else, is he?

862
01:10:03.494 --> 01:10:06.930
- Seeing? No.
- He's seeing somebody else.


863
01:10:07.097 --> 01:10:10.191
No, he's not! Trust me.
He's gonna die when he sees you.


864
01:10:10.367 --> 01:10:12.232
Why don't you have
something to eat.


865
01:10:12.402 --> 01:10:13.664
Fine. I'll...

866
01:10:14.438 --> 01:10:16.463
I'll have a Pizza Loco.

867
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.335
Like extra anchovies on that?

868
01:10:18.876 --> 01:10:20.104
No. Does anybody?

869
01:10:20.277 --> 01:10:23.644
Are you kidding? Oh, yeah.
It's the hottest item all summer.


870
01:10:23.814 --> 01:10:26.510
It's kind of a female thing around here.

871
01:10:42.099 --> 01:10:44.226
555-8411.

872
01:10:44.401 --> 01:10:50.033
Yeah, hello, look. I called earlier
to order the pizzas with extra anchovy.


873
01:10:51.408 --> 01:10:53.899
- Wilshire Motel?
- Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry.


874
01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:55.977
I'm gonna have to cancel that order.

875
01:10:56.146 --> 01:10:57.704
Too late. It's on its way.

876
01:11:01.051 --> 01:11:03.519
I'm afraid you don't understand.

877
01:11:03.687 --> 01:11:07.282
You see, I don't think
I can eat the anchovies.


878
01:11:07.457 --> 01:11:08.981
I'm a married woman.

879
01:11:09.159 --> 01:11:11.719
For all I care, you can throw
it out the window.


880
01:11:11.895 --> 01:11:14.386
You order it, you pay!

881
01:11:14.565 --> 01:11:16.157
No! Hello!

882
01:11:26.376 --> 01:11:29.311
Ice. Get some ice.

883
01:11:47.231 --> 01:11:48.960
Hello?

884
01:12:04.014 --> 01:12:05.345
Hello?

885
01:12:37.314 --> 01:12:39.282
Last one.

886
01:13:13.517 --> 01:13:15.417
Hey, hey, come here.

887
01:13:21.725 --> 01:13:24.888
Bring the little fish. Okay.
Good, good. Come on! Come on!


888
01:13:26.563 --> 01:13:28.554
Okay, okay. Look out!
Move over!


889
01:13:32.202 --> 01:13:35.797
- Mommy, can I have a piece of pizza?
- Maybe later.


890
01:13:37.474 --> 01:13:38.998
Somebody in there?

891
01:13:41.445 --> 01:13:42.878
Hello?

892
01:13:55.826 --> 01:13:57.851
Bye!

893
01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:08.702
Hey, Jen. All right.

894
01:14:08.872 --> 01:14:10.863
Jory. How are you?

895
01:14:11.041 --> 01:14:13.236
- You're looking good-
- Someone called.


896
01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:16.243
- Your mom's been in an accident.
- Good.


897
01:14:16.413 --> 01:14:17.710
She's in the hospital!

898
01:14:18.248 --> 01:14:20.478
Get out of my face, will you?

899
01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:23.210
Tell her why you don't
want me to talk to her.


900
01:14:23.387 --> 01:14:24.945
Go ahead. Tell her.

901
01:14:25.122 --> 01:14:28.922
Tell her Randy's making it with some
lady old enough to be my mother.


902
01:14:29.092 --> 01:14:31.925
Come on, Jen.
Let's get out of here.


903
01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:41.561
Hey, Tony! I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need a really-


904
01:14:41.738 --> 01:14:43.638
I need a really big favor.

905
01:14:43.807 --> 01:14:45.502
Randy, what is wrong now?

906
01:14:45.675 --> 01:14:48.906
You gotta deliver this
to the Wilshire Motel, Room 214.


907
01:14:49.479 --> 01:14:52.642
But it is all broken.
The tip will be very small.


908
01:14:52.816 --> 01:14:54.340
Don't worry about the tip.

909
01:14:54.518 --> 01:14:57.112
You gotta tell the woman
that you're very sorry.


910
01:14:57.287 --> 01:15:00.882
There are no more anchovies. She
should go home and forget about it.


911
01:15:01.058 --> 01:15:04.425
- But we have many anchovies.
- Yeah, I know. Just do it.


912
01:15:04.594 --> 01:15:06.459
Okay.

913
01:15:12.369 --> 01:15:14.803
You son of a bitch!

914
01:15:15.138 --> 01:15:18.198
Listen, man, I tried to tell her.
She wouldn't listen!


915
01:15:18.375 --> 01:15:21.003
How could you?
What kind of amoral chump are you?


916
01:15:21.178 --> 01:15:25.012
- I wouldn't call it amoral.
- It's the sickest thing I've ever heard!


917
01:15:25.182 --> 01:15:28.049
Oh, come on. I tried
to cover for you. I honestly did.


918
01:15:28.218 --> 01:15:30.652
Then Jory got to her.

919
01:15:31.621 --> 01:15:33.179
Jory got to my mother?

920
01:15:33.356 --> 01:15:34.880
- God! That is aw-
- No!


921
01:15:35.058 --> 01:15:36.821
- Jenny!
- Jenny?


922
01:15:36.993 --> 01:15:38.221
- She's here?
- Yes.


923
01:15:38.395 --> 01:15:39.987
Where is she?
What did she say?


924
01:15:40.163 --> 01:15:43.724
Does she want to get back together?
This is great.


925
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.460
Not, not really.

926
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.885
Hello, I-

927
01:16:09.259 --> 01:16:12.956
If you say another word,
I swear to God, I'll lose my nerve.


928
01:16:19.202 --> 01:16:21.170
- Diane!
- No. Dad?


929
01:16:21.338 --> 01:16:23.465
- Did a girl named Jenny call?
- No.


930
01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.633
Son, I think your mother
is gonna divorce me.


931
01:16:27.811 --> 01:16:30.974
- What?
- I think your mother has left.


932
01:16:31.148 --> 01:16:34.447
- You mean she's not back yet?
- Back from where?


933
01:16:35.385 --> 01:16:38.582
- From wherever she went.
- No.


934
01:16:38.755 --> 01:16:40.222
And tonight of all nights.

935
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:42.551
At a party where
every person we know...


936
01:16:42.726 --> 01:16:45.991
...is gonna watch a marriage
of 20 years go down the tube.


937
01:16:46.163 --> 01:16:48.097
- No!
- Yes.


938
01:16:48.265 --> 01:16:50.495
- I bet she went to Tiki Joe's.
- Tiki Joe's?


939
01:16:50.667 --> 01:16:53.727
To check on the last-minute details.
You know how she gets!


940
01:16:53.904 --> 01:16:56.395
- I'm gonna stop her.
- What?


941
01:16:56.706 --> 01:17:00.608
Help her. While you get
ready to go. Okay! Oh, good.


942
01:17:02.579 --> 01:17:04.444
Get ready!

943
01:17:14.658 --> 01:17:16.922
You are very beautiful.

944
01:17:19.062 --> 01:17:21.121
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

945
01:17:21.298 --> 01:17:22.959
I thought I could.

946
01:17:23.133 --> 01:17:25.795
- But I just can't.
- I have respect for this.


947
01:17:25.969 --> 01:17:28.870
Oh, well, thank you.
That's very nice of you.


948
01:17:29.039 --> 01:17:33.100
- You are not cheap and easy.
- No. I tried, but it's just not me.


949
01:17:33.276 --> 01:17:35.938
- Forget pizza. I buy you real dinner.
- No.


950
01:17:36.112 --> 01:17:37.773
Dinner and a movie.

951
01:17:37.948 --> 01:17:40.143
- No. Thank you, no.
- I pay!


952
01:17:40.317 --> 01:17:43.115
No! Look, I don't want
to sleep with you or date you.


953
01:17:43.286 --> 01:17:45.311
I just want to leave now.

954
01:17:45.488 --> 01:17:49.254
- You mean, you say no to me?
- Yes, I say no and goodbye.


955
01:17:49.426 --> 01:17:52.827
- You cannot leave.
- Oh, $200 dollars, right?


956
01:17:53.063 --> 01:17:56.157
No, it's $ 12.50.
I give you coupon discount.


957
01:17:57.067 --> 01:17:58.830
You give coupons?

958
01:17:59.002 --> 01:18:01.197
Not for everyone. A privilege.

959
01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:03.703
You are not the regular
American woman.


960
01:18:03.873 --> 01:18:06.273
And I am not the regular delivery boy.

961
01:18:06.443 --> 01:18:08.775
Oh, my God. You're not?

962
01:18:08.945 --> 01:18:11.004
No. He asked me to come here...

963
01:18:11.181 --> 01:18:13.479
...and say we have
no more anchovies.


964
01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:15.845
But I cannot lie to you, my darling.

965
01:18:16.019 --> 01:18:19.250
- I have many anchovies for you-
- Oh, no! No! Please!


966
01:18:19.422 --> 01:18:21.481
Oh, this is a horrible mistake.
I'm so-


967
01:18:21.658 --> 01:18:24.752
Oh, my God! Oh, you're just some-
Oh, my God!


968
01:18:24.928 --> 01:18:27.761
You cannot not leave. Wait!

969
01:18:27.931 --> 01:18:31.162
My anniversary party.
Oh, Joe's already there.


970
01:18:31.334 --> 01:18:33.928
Oh, God! All those people!

971
01:18:42.345 --> 01:18:43.607
Wait!

972
01:18:48.685 --> 01:18:50.550
- I'm such a jerk.
- Come on, Jenny.


973
01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.748
I was so stupid to come here without
calling first. What was I thinking?


974
01:18:55.925 --> 01:18:58.655
I hate to say it,
but the guy never appreciated you.


975
01:18:58.828 --> 01:19:00.955
I was just starting
to get over him too.


976
01:19:01.131 --> 01:19:03.622
Jen, don't be so hard on yourself.

977
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.633
I mean, so you made a mistake.
Big deal.


978
01:19:06.803 --> 01:19:08.498
You're a terrific person.

979
01:19:08.672 --> 01:19:13.166
You have everything going for you.
Hey, come on.


980
01:19:13.343 --> 01:19:15.607
Onward and upward, right?

981
01:19:15.779 --> 01:19:17.144
Yeah.

982
01:19:17.314 --> 01:19:20.010
Yeah, I guess, I-

983
01:19:20.183 --> 01:19:22.310
- Jory!
- You know, we'd be good together.


984
01:19:22.485 --> 01:19:24.248
- Get off me!
- We both need it.


985
01:19:24.421 --> 01:19:25.683
Get off!

986
01:19:26.256 --> 01:19:27.553
Stop!

987
01:19:35.598 --> 01:19:38.590
Stop! Stop!

988
01:19:38.768 --> 01:19:40.258
Thank you so much.

989
01:19:40.437 --> 01:19:44.339
You have just saved my life.
This guy was...


990
01:19:46.876 --> 01:19:49.868
- No funny cash withdrawals.
- Me neither.


991
01:19:50.046 --> 01:19:52.606
Sleazeball's a pro.
He's gotta be paid somehow.


992
01:19:52.782 --> 01:19:55.615
- Well, he wouldn't accept credit cards.
- Hold it.


993
01:19:55.785 --> 01:20:00.688
I've got three charges for deliveries
from someplace called Señor Pizza.


994
01:20:01.658 --> 01:20:02.886
So?

995
01:20:03.059 --> 01:20:06.893
Sold for 200 bucks a pop.
And Monica hates pizza.


996
01:20:08.932 --> 01:20:10.991
Wait a minute.

997
01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:13.761
- I got five of those.
- Oh, no.


998
01:20:15.438 --> 01:20:18.771
No, Jesus Christ!

999
01:20:36.326 --> 01:20:38.760
- I love you!
- Go away!


1000
01:20:41.064 --> 01:20:44.591
- Are you crazy? You'll be killed!
- I don't care.


1001
01:20:44.768 --> 01:20:47.168
- I will die for your love!
- Move your hand!


1002
01:20:47.337 --> 01:20:49.498
- I love you!
- Move that hand!


1003
01:20:49.672 --> 01:20:51.162
I love you!

1004
01:20:58.948 --> 01:21:02.714
He's probably some young beach-boy
stud. With a name like Jason...


1005
01:21:02.886 --> 01:21:04.877
Yeah, some poetry-reading wimp.

1006
01:21:05.054 --> 01:21:08.353
Whoever he is, he's gonna
get his face stomped.


1007
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.837
- Where's Tony?
- Tony?


1008
01:21:26.009 --> 01:21:29.740
He never came back from his break.
Sal's on delivery. I'm all alone.


1009
01:21:29.913 --> 01:21:33.178
- Randy?
- Jenny.


1010
01:21:35.819 --> 01:21:37.684
You look different.

1011
01:21:38.087 --> 01:21:40.180
Since when do you notice that?

1012
01:21:41.257 --> 01:21:43.555
I see you've changed your style.

1013
01:21:43.726 --> 01:21:46.991
Oh, yes, I have.

1014
01:21:53.837 --> 01:21:56.533
- I missed you.
- Did you?


1015
01:21:57.407 --> 01:21:59.272
Yes.

1016
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:02.474
You bitch! Nobody plays
with me like that-


1017
01:22:02.645 --> 01:22:04.636
- Leave her alone!
- You and me, bozo!


1018
01:22:04.814 --> 01:22:06.441
All right! Outside! Outside!

1019
01:22:06.616 --> 01:22:08.709
Take it outside! Come on.
Come on.


1020
01:22:14.057 --> 01:22:16.855
- Don't do this.
- Jenny, stay out of it.


1021
01:22:21.598 --> 01:22:24.761
- No watches and no rings.
- No chains.


1022
01:22:24.934 --> 01:22:28.495
It's got extra everything.
Sausages and the jalapeño peppers-


1023
01:22:28.938 --> 01:22:31.202
Where's your delivery guy?

1024
01:22:32.275 --> 01:22:34.743
Out...
Out back.


1025
01:22:34.911 --> 01:22:37.709
Where you going?
Hey, wait a minute. Where you-?


1026
01:22:37.881 --> 01:22:39.178
Come on, come on.

1027
01:22:39.349 --> 01:22:42.910
- Randy, can we just get out of here?
- This is something I gotta do.


1028
01:22:43.086 --> 01:22:45.884
What are you, chicken?
What are you waiting for?


1029
01:22:47.257 --> 01:22:48.485
Jeez!

1030
01:22:48.658 --> 01:22:50.250
Hey, wait! Wait!

1031
01:22:50.426 --> 01:22:52.656
You're Joe Bodek's son!

1032
01:22:53.429 --> 01:22:54.726
Yeah.

1033
01:22:54.898 --> 01:22:56.957
Okay. All right.

1034
01:22:57.133 --> 01:22:59.226
I'm Randy Bodek.

1035
01:22:59.402 --> 01:23:02.565
Hey, what is this?
Leave him alone! It's not him.


1036
01:23:03.039 --> 01:23:05.200
He's a homo!

1037
01:23:08.578 --> 01:23:11.240
All right, Bodek. You ready
to get your ass kicked?


1038
01:23:18.054 --> 01:23:19.817
Oh, no.

1039
01:23:21.591 --> 01:23:23.422
I'm talking to him.

1040
01:23:31.834 --> 01:23:35.827
Your stud days are over, pretty boy!

1041
01:23:43.713 --> 01:23:44.941
Right in the face!

1042
01:23:56.225 --> 01:23:58.216
Okay, let's go!

1043
01:24:02.532 --> 01:24:06.491
- What is going on?
- It's a long story.


1044
01:24:12.175 --> 01:24:15.008
Your luggage, pal. Luggage!

1045
01:24:18.381 --> 01:24:20.941
- Cocktail, Mr. Bodek?
- Yeah, why not?


1046
01:24:25.355 --> 01:24:27.687
Hi. How y'all doing?

1047
01:24:33.863 --> 01:24:37.526
Hey, Joe, congratulations.
Where's the better half?


1048
01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.429
Wish I knew.

1049
01:24:50.713 --> 01:24:53.045
Oh, my God!

1050
01:25:37.794 --> 01:25:39.853
What do you think
of your lover-boy now?


1051
01:25:40.029 --> 01:25:43.123
He's delivered
his last pizza around here.


1052
01:25:44.233 --> 01:25:45.666
Who is this?

1053
01:25:46.069 --> 01:25:49.266
Pizza? Looking for the guy
who delivers pizza?


1054
01:25:51.207 --> 01:25:54.506
Well, it wasn't exactly how
I planned to spend my summer.


1055
01:25:55.411 --> 01:25:56.639
Just happened.

1056
01:25:59.348 --> 01:26:00.940
You hate me?

1057
01:26:01.918 --> 01:26:05.718
How am I supposed to feel, knowing
that you slept with all those women?


1058
01:26:05.888 --> 01:26:09.221
Well, see, the weird thing is,
I didn't sleep with all of them.


1059
01:26:09.392 --> 01:26:11.986
They wanted somebody
to make them feel special.


1060
01:26:12.161 --> 01:26:13.685
Come on.

1061
01:26:15.998 --> 01:26:19.627
There are a lot of women out there
who don't believe in love anymore.


1062
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:24.304
You know, all they wanted was
a little romance and a little respect.


1063
01:26:24.474 --> 01:26:27.068
So I tried to give
them what they missed.


1064
01:26:28.144 --> 01:26:29.736
You did all this for them?

1065
01:26:29.912 --> 01:26:33.279
No! I did it because
I had to pay my own tuition.


1066
01:26:34.283 --> 01:26:35.875
You know.

1067
01:26:36.419 --> 01:26:38.819
Because I had to get back to you.

1068
01:26:40.323 --> 01:26:43.918
And how would you feel if I said:

1069
01:26:44.794 --> 01:26:47.922
"I slept with all these guys
this summer, but, hey...


1070
01:26:48.598 --> 01:26:50.532
...I did it for you"?

1071
01:26:53.269 --> 01:26:55.328
I'd hate it.

1072
01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:59.335
Just take me to the bus station.

1073
01:27:00.376 --> 01:27:02.071
Okay.

1074
01:27:03.012 --> 01:27:05.674
- I just have to make one stop first.
- Where?


1075
01:27:05.848 --> 01:27:08.874
Well, I gotta save
my parents' marriage.


1076
01:27:28.104 --> 01:27:29.366
Hey!

1077
01:27:30.873 --> 01:27:32.864
That woman nuts?

1078
01:27:33.042 --> 01:27:34.805
That's my mother!

1079
01:27:34.977 --> 01:27:36.842
- Hello. Diane?
- Hi, hi, hi.


1080
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:49.052
- Randy!
- Eyes front.


1081
01:27:49.992 --> 01:27:51.653
Hey!

1082
01:27:54.764 --> 01:27:57.665
- Who was that?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.


1083
01:28:02.738 --> 01:28:04.330
Joe!

1084
01:28:04.507 --> 01:28:06.600
Oh, Joe! Oh, Joe!

1085
01:28:10.112 --> 01:28:12.672
- Joe, I'm so sorry.
- No, honey, I am so sorry.


1086
01:28:12.849 --> 01:28:15.511
- I am so sorry.
- Later, Linda.


1087
01:28:15.685 --> 01:28:18.279
- See, your husband-
- No problem, Linda. Okay?


1088
01:28:18.454 --> 01:28:20.888
- Go away. Go away! Go away!
- Joe.


1089
01:28:21.057 --> 01:28:23.855
Okay. Okay.

1090
01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:26.690
Hi, I'm Brad.
Frosty beverage?


1091
01:28:26.863 --> 01:28:28.194
No. No frosty beverage.

1092
01:28:28.364 --> 01:28:29.626
- Thank you.
- Okay.


1093
01:28:30.766 --> 01:28:32.563
Look out!

1094
01:28:36.672 --> 01:28:39.072
So this is the man
who stands between us.


1095
01:28:39.242 --> 01:28:42.075
Tony! Tony!
What are you doing here?


1096
01:28:42.245 --> 01:28:44.509
- I need to speak with you.
- But-


1097
01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.739
Now look, I've been thinking this over.

1098
01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:48.281
- I'm your father.
- I know.


1099
01:28:48.451 --> 01:28:52.547
You're my son and I love you,
and it's really okay that you're gay.


1100
01:28:52.722 --> 01:28:54.246
- Gay?
- What?


1101
01:28:54.423 --> 01:28:57.722
I don't think this is the place
for your lover to make a scene.


1102
01:28:57.894 --> 01:29:00.124
- Lover?
- What are you talking about?


1103
01:29:00.296 --> 01:29:02.958
I know all about you
and this guy Alex, here.


1104
01:29:03.499 --> 01:29:05.296
- But I'm Tony.
- You're who?


1105
01:29:05.468 --> 01:29:08.096
I meet this woman
when I deliver pizza for him.


1106
01:29:08.604 --> 01:29:10.299
For you?

1107
01:29:10.573 --> 01:29:13.406
- You're the regular delivery boy?
- Yeah, see-


1108
01:29:13.576 --> 01:29:15.806
- So, what is this guy doing here?
- Well-


1109
01:29:15.978 --> 01:29:18.242
- I love her.
- What did you say?


1110
01:29:18.414 --> 01:29:20.177
- She needs a real man.
- Oh, no.


1111
01:29:20.349 --> 01:29:21.839
- Are you talking to me?
- Dad!


1112
01:29:22.018 --> 01:29:25.454
- No, no. Wait, Dad! Dad!
- No! No! No!


1113
01:29:26.188 --> 01:29:29.316
- He better be in there, kid.
- Yeah, he better.


1114
01:29:31.494 --> 01:29:33.462
Joe! Joe! Joe!

1115
01:29:33.629 --> 01:29:35.597
Come on. Come on.
Calm down.


1116
01:29:40.369 --> 01:29:42.428
There he is!
That's him!


1117
01:30:07.863 --> 01:30:09.330
- Randy!
- What?


1118
01:30:09.498 --> 01:30:11.830
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Come on.


1119
01:30:12.802 --> 01:30:15.965
Come here. You come here.
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.


1120
01:30:20.376 --> 01:30:22.207
No!

1121
01:30:26.148 --> 01:30:28.673
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?


1122
01:30:30.419 --> 01:30:32.887
Oh, Felicia.

1123
01:30:43.833 --> 01:30:47.166
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1124
01:30:47.636 --> 01:30:50.537
You son of a bitch!

1125
01:30:51.007 --> 01:30:53.601
My favorite toupee!

1126
01:30:53.843 --> 01:30:55.868
Mom!
Excuse me.


1127
01:31:11.727 --> 01:31:13.820
Let me in there.

1128
01:31:18.601 --> 01:31:21.126
Kid, you're gone.
Your days are numbered.


1129
01:31:21.303 --> 01:31:23.066
He's getting away!

1130
01:31:41.757 --> 01:31:43.019
Come here.

1131
01:31:43.192 --> 01:31:45.092
All right.
What the hell is all this?


1132
01:31:45.261 --> 01:31:47.889
- Your son has been porking my wife!
- Mine too.


1133
01:31:48.064 --> 01:31:49.395
Same here.

1134
01:31:49.565 --> 01:31:51.226
- I thought you were gay!
- No!


1135
01:31:52.535 --> 01:31:54.400
Mom!

1136
01:31:55.271 --> 01:31:58.707
Mom, I don't believe this!

1137
01:32:02.244 --> 01:32:06.442
Hold it, you three.
Hold it right there.


1138
01:32:10.186 --> 01:32:12.051
- Oh, wait. Wait. Mom? Dad?
- Yes.


1139
01:32:12.221 --> 01:32:14.018
Excuse me.

1140
01:32:14.290 --> 01:32:17.987
This is Jenny. We've been living
together for two semesters.


1141
01:32:18.961 --> 01:32:21.054
And I'm in love with her.

1142
01:32:21.697 --> 01:32:24.530
You have no idea
how happy I am to meet you.


1143
01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:26.497
- It's nice to meet you.
- Beautiful.


1144
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:28.364
- How pretty you are.
- Thank you.


1145
01:32:28.537 --> 01:32:30.368
- This is great.
- This is beautiful.


1146
01:32:30.539 --> 01:32:31.904
- Come on, let's go.
- Go.


1147
01:32:32.074 --> 01:32:34.599
- Frosty beverage?
- Thank you.


1148
01:32:37.279 --> 01:32:41.716
- So you're a friend of his?
- Best friend.


1149
01:32:43.219 --> 01:32:45.483
There's this song.
It goes:


1150
01:32:51.427 --> 01:32:54.885
That's it!
Can you play that?


1151
01:33:10.312 --> 01:33:11.609
- Come on.
- I don't know.


1152
01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.372
Come on.

1153
01:33:14.817 --> 01:33:17.251
Jenny, I'm gonna
give the money back.


1154
01:33:17.419 --> 01:33:19.649
I don't want it.
I'm gonna keep my day job.


1155
01:33:19.822 --> 01:33:21.813
I'm gonna come
and see you on weekends.


1156
01:33:21.991 --> 01:33:24.721
Forget about it.
You're going back to college.


1157
01:33:24.894 --> 01:33:26.759
You got some idea
what you're doing.


1158
01:33:26.929 --> 01:33:29.397
Oh, I do.
I want to major in premed...


1159
01:33:29.565 --> 01:33:34.502
...minor in Japanese,
study some photography courses...


1160
01:33:35.437 --> 01:33:38.497
- I think we'll talk about this tomorrow.
- Okay.


1161
01:33:38.674 --> 01:33:40.403
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


1162
01:33:40.576 --> 01:33:42.703
Where did you learn this?
Never mind.


1163
01:33:42.878 --> 01:33:45.176
I don't want to know.

1164
01:35:08.864 --> 01:35:11.025
Oh, by the way, the husbands?

1165
01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.998
Their wives did show up
to bail them out.


1166
01:35:14.169 --> 01:35:18.936
Claude and Monica, they decided
to forget the whole thing.


1167
01:35:20.175 --> 01:35:24.407
Joyce and Reed, well,
they weren't gonna forget anything.


1168
01:35:27.483 --> 01:35:29.451
But they decided to make up anyway.

1169
01:35:30.052 --> 01:35:32.111
Kyoko was gonna bail out Harry.

1170
01:35:32.288 --> 01:35:34.950
Then it hit her,
"Why ruin a good thing?"


1171
01:35:35.758 --> 01:35:38.591
Hey, get your hands off of me!

1172
01:35:38.761 --> 01:35:40.729
I want to talk to my wife!
