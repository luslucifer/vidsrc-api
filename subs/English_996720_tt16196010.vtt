(Knocking)

15
00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:11.221
Police!

16
00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:12.422
Anybody home?

17
00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:15.425
Hey, it's me.

18
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.730
Look, I know you just
wanted some space,


19
00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:21.465
but don't you think
this has just gone on too far?


20
00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:22.934
(Knocking)

21
00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:25.635
Mrs Freeman? It's the Police.

22
00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:28.673
We're just here to check
if you're OK, madame.


23
00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:33.878
I am so sorry about how
I left things the other night.


24
00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:37.347
I didn't mean for those things
to come out the way they did,
but they...


25
00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:40.350
They just did.

26
00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:45.690
Sarge.

27
00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.033
CAD 9619, foul odour coming
from inside of the property.


28
00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.436
We're gonna be putting this
door in under section 17,


29
00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:00.738
if you can update
the CAD please?


30
00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:03.340
(Radio) Received. Go ahead.

31
00:02:04.942 --> 00:02:06.309
We can get through it together,
we've done it before and we can
do it again.


32
00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:08.378
Please, I am begging you, Liv.

33
00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:10.614
Just let me in.

34
00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:11.615
(Door breaks)

35
00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:16.586
Oh, Jesus

36
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.657
(Coughing)

37
00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:24.829
(Answer machine) Last month,
I wish I'd just given you
the biggest hug


38
00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:26.898
and told you that everything was
gonna be alright.


39
00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:29.332
What I would do to just...

40
00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.869
hold you again.

41
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.704
(Coughing)

42
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:38.676
(Answer machine) I don't
wanna be separated anymore.


43
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.479
(Answer machine) And I know that
you're not answering my calls
right now, but...


44
00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:45.817
(Answer machine) I'm gonna swing
by tomorrow morning, and then...


45
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.451
(Answer machine) All I ask is
that just you and me can talk
in person.


46
00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:50.453
Please, Liv, I am begging you.

47
00:02:51.823 --> 00:02:54.759
Nothing makes sense anymore.

48
00:02:56.994 --> 00:02:58.461
(Answer machine) It's just dull.

49
00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:01.565
(Officer coughs)

50
00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:02.733
(Answer machine) And you
are the love of my life


51
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.773
I'll see you tomorrow.

52
00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:11.441
Hopefully.

53
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.611
I love you.

54
00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:22.720
(Flies buzzing)

55
00:03:23.788 --> 00:03:25.790
(The Officers cough and gag)

56
00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:47.544
(Loud knocking)

57
00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:51.514
(Loud knocking)

58
00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:03.593
(Somber music)

59
00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:45.069
Thank you all for coming today.

60
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:49.040
I know Liv would be...

61
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:57.214
...astonished just to see this
many people in one room for her.


62
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:01.852
And I take it you all...

63
00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:06.657
...Understood, in some way.

64
00:05:10.962 --> 00:05:13.664
The more you knew Liv,

65
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.802
the more she would
push you away.


66
00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:23.606
You're not hungry?

67
00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:25.776
I ate something before.

68
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.278
-Please, Liv, let's just not do
this. -I'm not hungry.


69
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:28.779
If you just let me come home.

70
00:05:28.813 --> 00:05:30.580
Jed, we spoke
about that. Please.


71
00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:32.016
-But you were doing so well. If
I just... -STOP IT!


72
00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:39.023
-I said we'd spoken
about that, OK?


73
00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:40.725
-I'm trying to help you here.

74
00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:43.260
Just help yourself.

75
00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:45.863
I'm fine.

76
00:05:45.896 --> 00:05:47.965
You're not fine, Liv.

77
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:50.101
I need more time.

78
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:51.135
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.176
Every day that we had together,
I would see...


80
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:01.912
happiness

81
00:06:03.114 --> 00:06:04.514
kindness.

82
00:06:06.884 --> 00:06:08.119
Beauty.

83
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.060
But when she looked in
the mirror she would see
something...


84
00:06:19.697 --> 00:06:21.232
...Something different.

85
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.105
She would say to me "How can
you love something so ugly?"


86
00:06:29.673 --> 00:06:32.575
And she would judge
me for loving her.


87
00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:36.247
I tried so hard to fix her.

88
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:38.682
I tried so fucking hard!

89
00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:42.720
(Scuffling)

90
00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:15.186
Hey, buddy.
Can I get you a drink?


91
00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:19.223
Who are you?

92
00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:22.259
Lionel Flack.

93
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.329
Entrepreneur and
confidant of many.


94
00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:27.164
A man of many talents.

95
00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:30.167
Friends call me Lie.

96
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:41.345
See, uh

97
00:07:41.745 --> 00:07:42.880
where I'm from,

98
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.782
a couple of blocks away
was this, uh


99
00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:46.217
discount store.

100
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.018
Sold all sorts of shit.

101
00:07:48.252 --> 00:07:51.088
But the only glasses they ever
sold were these, uh


102
00:07:51.288 --> 00:07:52.790
cheap champagne
flutes


103
00:07:53.023 --> 00:07:55.192
which was convenient though
because my Momma,


104
00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:57.128
God rest her
soul,


105
00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:59.697
had a love / hate relationship
with champagne of all things.


106
00:08:00.097 --> 00:08:01.765
Now, here's the
interesting part.


107
00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:04.368
Your average cup-

108
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:06.237
-Average cup?

109
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.905
Highball, Demitasse,
Collins glass. Whatever.


110
00:08:08.873 --> 00:08:11.842
I realised that nothing fulfils
or quenches ones thirst


111
00:08:11.876 --> 00:08:14.011
the same way as a
champagne flute does.


112
00:08:14.778 --> 00:08:16.046
Whatever the beverage.

113
00:08:16.313 --> 00:08:18.648
Fruit juices in particular,
especially when chilled.


114
00:08:19.316 --> 00:08:20.151
(Lionel chuckles)

115
00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:23.787
(Gulping)

116
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.658
(He gasps)

117
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.361
By the way

118
00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:32.363
that eulogy,

119
00:08:33.063 --> 00:08:36.066
Oscar worthy, truly.
I admire that.


120
00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.971
What is it that
you want, Lionel?


121
00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:43.240
Firstly, to explain myself.

122
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.677
You see, I'm an avid
fan of obituaries.


123
00:08:47.144 --> 00:08:49.246
I read them every day.

124
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.484
I started going to funerals and
it's there that I found my
peace.


125
00:08:53.517 --> 00:08:55.019
-You should try it sometime.

126
00:08:55.052 --> 00:08:56.921
-Thanks, but I've got
other plans.


127
00:08:56.954 --> 00:08:58.756
Such as?

128
00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:00.424
Well, let's just say life didn't
deal me the greatest hand.


129
00:09:01.492 --> 00:09:04.061
You know, I've played my cards
and I am done.


130
00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:08.132
Thanks for the drink.

131
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.235
(Ominous music)

132
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.772
All that weight you're carrying,

133
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:19.276
what if I said I could
take it all away?


134
00:09:21.946 --> 00:09:23.080
All of it.

135
00:09:24.448 --> 00:09:27.284
Nice meeting you, Lionel.

136
00:09:47.438 --> 00:09:49.740
(Jed sobbing)

137
00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:12.763
This afternoon, at lunch.

138
00:10:15.099 --> 00:10:16.367
I never asked how you were.

139
00:10:17.334 --> 00:10:18.168
So,

140
00:10:19.236 --> 00:10:20.070
how are you?

141
00:10:22.273 --> 00:10:23.407
I'm fine.

142
00:10:26.844 --> 00:10:28.045
Are you ok?

143
00:10:30.514 --> 00:10:31.382
No.

144
00:10:32.416 --> 00:10:34.051
Please just talk to me.

145
00:10:34.385 --> 00:10:35.986
Like you could understand.

146
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.255
Are you mad?

147
00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:40.157
You know exactly what
I went through with my dad,


148
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.060
so don't tell me that I don't
understand people like you.


149
00:10:43.093 --> 00:10:44.561
People like me?

150
00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:47.298
Yes. Damaged, silently
screaming out for help,


151
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:50.467
knowing full well that the
people who can actually help you


152
00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:51.502
can't do a fucking thing.

153
00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:52.836
And why is that?

154
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.938
Because you won't let them!

155
00:10:54.972 --> 00:10:58.008
And we do the same old dance,
over and over and over again


156
00:10:58.042 --> 00:11:01.145
until eventually you'll
keel over and fucking die.


157
00:11:03.047 --> 00:11:04.581
You keel over and die.

158
00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:08.319
I want you gone.

159
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.388
As you wish.

160
00:11:17.528 --> 00:11:19.463
(Sobbing)

161
00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:27.204
Oh, fucking, God.

162
00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:31.442
(Sobbing)

163
00:11:42.453 --> 00:11:43.287
Hey...

164
00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:57.534
(Lionel chewing loudly)

165
00:11:58.602 --> 00:12:00.270
Is this Lionel?

166
00:12:00.604 --> 00:12:02.139
(Chewing continues)

167
00:12:02.373 --> 00:12:03.207
Yeah.

168
00:12:04.108 --> 00:12:04.942
Its, erm.

169
00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:07.878
It's Jed, from the pub.

170
00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:09.446
(Lionel chuckles)

171
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.648
What can I do for you, Jed?

172
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.485
God, I don't even
know why I'm calling.


173
00:12:14.952 --> 00:12:15.552
I...

174
00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:17.554
Erm-

175
00:12:17.588 --> 00:12:19.590
-I think you know exactly
why you're calling me, Jed.


176
00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:22.393
Will you help me?

177
00:12:25.529 --> 00:12:26.897
Do you know what I do, Jed?

178
00:12:27.398 --> 00:12:28.700
Assisted suicide.

179
00:12:28.733 --> 00:12:29.566
Jed

180
00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:30.901
Listen to me.

181
00:12:32.035 --> 00:12:33.437
You're a good man.

182
00:12:33.705 --> 00:12:37.341
But when you see her again,
and you will see her again,


183
00:12:38.075 --> 00:12:40.511
you have got to radiate
happiness, brother.


184
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:45.015
Now, I promise you that
by the end of our journey,


185
00:12:45.048 --> 00:12:48.051
you'll be lying in a
state of total bliss,


186
00:12:48.085 --> 00:12:50.554
with so much unconditional love
for yourself that you'll be
laughing


187
00:12:50.587 --> 00:12:53.390
all the way to the
pearly white gates.


188
00:12:53.424 --> 00:12:55.660
Just tell me how it works.

189
00:12:56.093 --> 00:12:57.561
Well, how did she die?

190
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:05.202
It was a...

191
00:13:06.503 --> 00:13:09.106
An eating disorder.

192
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.943
Bulimia most of her life.

193
00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:16.447
Her stomach ruptured

194
00:13:16.714 --> 00:13:18.115
she blacked out,

195
00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:20.551
and her heart just...

196
00:13:21.084 --> 00:13:22.052
...stopped.

197
00:13:26.724 --> 00:13:29.226
She starved herself
to death and...


198
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.162
...she was eaten
from the inside out.


199
00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:37.501
How about the outside in?

200
00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:43.207
What do you mean?

201
00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:47.044
Jed, have you heard
of the Yiurkun tribe?


202
00:13:48.178 --> 00:13:50.447
They are a collective
of enlightened individuals


203
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:53.350
that bask in a state
of permanent euphoria.


204
00:13:53.584 --> 00:13:59.523
Now, this is achieved by way
of consensual human consumption.


205
00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:02.794
A direct connection with
the universe, Herself.


206
00:14:02.827 --> 00:14:04.127
Wait, wait, wait.

207
00:14:04.628 --> 00:14:06.363
So what are you saying?-

208
00:14:06.396 --> 00:14:09.199
-It just so happens, Jed,
that I share the same taste


209
00:14:09.233 --> 00:14:10.501
for both She

210
00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:13.170
and my fellow man.

211
00:14:13.671 --> 00:14:14.605
So...

212
00:14:14.638 --> 00:14:16.406
you wanna eat me?

213
00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:21.278
That is exactly what I'm saying.

214
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.282
That is sacrifice, Jed.

215
00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:27.150
That is selflessness.

216
00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:31.054
That, my friend, is the most
heroic end of one chapter


217
00:14:31.088 --> 00:14:32.757
before the next begins.

218
00:14:34.726 --> 00:14:36.794
It's wonderfully
poetic, is it not?


219
00:14:39.196 --> 00:14:41.565
It's a lot to take in.

220
00:14:41.598 --> 00:14:43.801
Well, hows about I let
you sleep on it, Jed?


221
00:14:43.835 --> 00:14:45.502
And when you decide to proceed,

222
00:14:45.536 --> 00:14:48.138
I'll be back at Graham's Bar
from 6pm tomorrow.


223
00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:49.339
(Phone slams down)

224
00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:05.455
(Erupting applause)

225
00:15:20.905 --> 00:15:22.506
(Flies buzzing)

226
00:15:36.821 --> 00:15:38.155
I'm not hungry.

227
00:16:13.925 --> 00:16:15.827
(Phone ringing)

228
00:16:23.835 --> 00:16:24.736
Yeah?

229
00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:26.236
(Jed) I'll do it.

230
00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:28.238
(Jed) I'm in.

231
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.408
(Gentle rain pattering)

232
00:16:51.395 --> 00:16:52.664
No ducks here.

233
00:16:52.697 --> 00:16:53.731
Sorry, what?

234
00:16:53.765 --> 00:16:55.532
Uh, this pond has no ducks.

235
00:16:55.565 --> 00:16:57.300
Oh no, I know.
I'm here for the fish.


236
00:16:58.736 --> 00:17:00.672
I know, sounds crazy, right?

237
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.351
I'm Alex.

238
00:17:14.384 --> 00:17:15.385
Oops! Sorry. (Laughs nervously)

239
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.854
Lionel.

240
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:26.764
So, do you have any of your own?

241
00:17:27.364 --> 00:17:28.498
Erm, no.

242
00:17:28.532 --> 00:17:29.967
Too high maintenance for me.

243
00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:33.738
They are literally the most low
maintenance pet one could have.


244
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:38.375
Fresh water fish are the largest
proportion of pets owned
across the US.


245
00:17:38.408 --> 00:17:42.279
And they are proven to lower
blood pressure and heart rate.


246
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:45.683
Thus, relieving stress for
maintaining a better quality
of life.


247
00:17:45.883 --> 00:17:47.952
You do this for a
living, you sell them?


248
00:17:48.953 --> 00:17:50.387
No.

249
00:17:51.656 --> 00:17:52.890
I'm just saying they're good for
maintaining equilibrium, is all.


250
00:17:53.725 --> 00:17:55.392
So, you think I'm unbalanced?

251
00:17:56.526 --> 00:17:59.030
Do you think you're unbalanced?

252
00:17:59.063 --> 00:18:00.297
(Alex laughs)

253
00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:07.571
Do you know what?
I'll make you a deal.


254
00:18:07.604 --> 00:18:09.741
I'll give you a chance to
convince me to get one of those


255
00:18:09.774 --> 00:18:11.541
tank thingies, if you

256
00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:14.444
pop by and try my
signature cappuccino?


257
00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:20.952
You know what?
You have yourself a deal.


258
00:18:20.985 --> 00:18:23.921
But I have some business now
I need to attend to today
though, so.


259
00:18:23.955 --> 00:18:26.323
Wait! Have you got a
number I can call you on?


260
00:18:32.797 --> 00:18:33.630
That's me.

261
00:18:34.899 --> 00:18:35.967
I gotta run though.

262
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.001
Nice to meet you!

263
00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:39.436
Nice to meet you too Lionel...

264
00:18:41.505 --> 00:18:42.405
...Flack.

265
00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:45.442
(Alex chuckles)

266
00:18:53.617 --> 00:18:55.418
Howdy, brother.

267
00:18:55.452 --> 00:18:58.022
I was not expecting you
for another thirteen minutes.


268
00:18:58.055 --> 00:19:00.024
Well, in the spirit
of turning the page.


269
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.693
Jed,

270
00:19:02.727 --> 00:19:05.730
over the course of our time
together, my job is to make sure
you are happy.


271
00:19:05.763 --> 00:19:08.632
And at any point you're in pain
or in discomfort,


272
00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:10.067
you just need to let me know.

273
00:19:12.103 --> 00:19:16.339
So, do you eat normal
food or just-


274
00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:18.843
Kettle corn.

275
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:21.478
Here you go guys.
You ready to order?


276
00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:23.413
Thank you very much
but he's not hungry.


277
00:19:23.714 --> 00:19:24.548
The bill, please.

278
00:19:37.494 --> 00:19:39.063
Have a read of that

279
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:41.833
and sign and date at the bottom.

280
00:19:42.532 --> 00:19:45.903
I trust you Jed,
but I need your full consent.


281
00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:52.677
"Termination and disposal
upon breach of contract?"


282
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.513
If you change your mind, Jed,
I need to protect myself.


283
00:19:59.917 --> 00:20:01.418
I want you gone.

284
00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:23.506
L'Chaim!

285
00:20:23.908 --> 00:20:25.542
L'CHAIM!

286
00:20:26.878 --> 00:20:29.113
Welcome to the
afterlife, brother.


287
00:20:29.146 --> 00:20:32.549
Now, let's get you reunited with
that smoking hot wife of yours.


288
00:20:33.684 --> 00:20:35.418
Cell phone, please.

289
00:20:40.791 --> 00:20:42.727
Would you, uh.
Would you mind?


290
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.171
Casa del Lie!

291
00:21:05.548 --> 00:21:08.085
Step one for a pain-free
first procedure.


292
00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:10.655
Drink.

293
00:21:10.688 --> 00:21:11.621
OK.

294
00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:15.625
Attaboy.

295
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:17.995
Living room.

296
00:21:23.768 --> 00:21:24.735
Bermuda.

297
00:21:25.602 --> 00:21:26.404
Huh?

298
00:21:26.737 --> 00:21:28.139
My fish, Bermuda.

299
00:21:30.607 --> 00:21:31.876
Do you live alone?

300
00:21:34.511 --> 00:21:35.146
Yep.

301
00:21:40.217 --> 00:21:42.019
What's through there?

302
00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:43.821
Storage.

303
00:21:51.195 --> 00:21:53.164
Theres... There's that.

304
00:22:01.872 --> 00:22:03.074
Right. Now, uh.

305
00:22:04.308 --> 00:22:06.509
Put this on, freshen up and
meet me back in the living room.


306
00:22:07.712 --> 00:22:10.547
Oh, and have an amuse bouche.

307
00:22:34.038 --> 00:22:35.806
(Crunching)

308
00:23:07.304 --> 00:23:10.141
You take photos?

309
00:23:10.908 --> 00:23:12.109
Yessiree bob.

310
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.212
Big time hobby of mine
alongside the day job.


311
00:23:15.913 --> 00:23:16.814
Check it out.

312
00:23:17.915 --> 00:23:19.784
See, when my step daddy left,

313
00:23:19.817 --> 00:23:22.720
my Momma encouraged me
to pursue photography.


314
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.757
She always said
I was the artist of the family.


315
00:23:27.124 --> 00:23:31.028
And I guess I found myself
walking down the old, uh,


316
00:23:31.628 --> 00:23:33.330
life modeling road, and

317
00:23:33.864 --> 00:23:37.735
You know, I kind of had a knack
for erotica and abstract
exoticism, really.


318
00:23:38.002 --> 00:23:39.336
So, who is she?

319
00:23:41.638 --> 00:23:42.807
My Momma.

320
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.175
(Jed gasps)

321
00:23:56.387 --> 00:23:58.122
(Wretching)

322
00:24:01.025 --> 00:24:02.326
I'm so sorry!

323
00:24:03.194 --> 00:24:05.362
That's fine, erm.
He'll be fine.


324
00:24:06.063 --> 00:24:08.132
You can clean that out
in the morning for me, Jed.


325
00:24:09.266 --> 00:24:10.301
Take a seat.

326
00:24:10.734 --> 00:24:11.769
(Jed groans)

327
00:24:13.704 --> 00:24:15.339
Careful of that
one, she's loose.


328
00:24:17.908 --> 00:24:19.310
Bare with me, Jed.

329
00:24:23.747 --> 00:24:25.049
Step two.

330
00:24:26.417 --> 00:24:27.885
What's step three?

331
00:24:30.454 --> 00:24:31.922
Step three...

332
00:24:31.956 --> 00:24:32.790
OK.

333
00:24:40.764 --> 00:24:41.832
What are you doing?

334
00:24:42.933 --> 00:24:43.934
What's best.

335
00:24:43.968 --> 00:24:45.202
What's that now?

336
00:24:46.904 --> 00:24:47.771
Nothing.

337
00:24:52.143 --> 00:24:53.110
There we go.

338
00:24:53.744 --> 00:24:54.912
How does that feel?

339
00:24:57.181 --> 00:24:58.883
I can't feel a thing.

340
00:24:58.916 --> 00:24:59.750
Good.

341
00:25:01.719 --> 00:25:02.353
You ready?

342
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.191
(Bones crunching)

343
00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:09.193
(Jed gasps)

344
00:25:23.774 --> 00:25:24.808
(Hissing)

345
00:25:24.842 --> 00:25:25.943
(Jed shrieks)

346
00:25:40.758 --> 00:25:42.426
(Sizzling)

347
00:25:59.176 --> 00:26:00.044
How do you feel?

348
00:26:03.214 --> 00:26:04.114
Lighter.

349
00:26:05.182 --> 00:26:06.150
Attaboy.

350
00:26:06.183 --> 00:26:07.151
Proud of you.

351
00:26:09.086 --> 00:26:10.888
Well, I think that's
it for this evening.


352
00:26:11.555 --> 00:26:12.389
I'm beat!

353
00:26:13.324 --> 00:26:14.191
Huh?

354
00:26:14.225 --> 00:26:15.392
Sweet dreams, pal.

355
00:26:47.291 --> 00:26:49.260
(Sobbing)

356
00:27:22.593 --> 00:27:23.927
(Wretching)

357
00:28:14.945 --> 00:28:15.846
Lionel?

358
00:28:17.514 --> 00:28:18.849
Lionel?

359
00:28:30.327 --> 00:28:32.363
Hey! Come in.

360
00:29:17.541 --> 00:29:18.542
Fuck!

361
00:29:30.287 --> 00:29:31.455
I don't eat...
.


362
00:29:32.089 --> 00:29:33.223
milk.

363
00:29:34.024 --> 00:29:34.925
It's almond.

364
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:48.706
Mmm.

365
00:30:22.072 --> 00:30:22.707
Sorry, buddy.

366
00:30:50.802 --> 00:30:52.269
Can I ask you something?

367
00:30:54.471 --> 00:30:55.305
Sure.

368
00:30:56.774 --> 00:31:00.244
What would you do if
you found out that


369
00:31:00.544 --> 00:31:04.114
somebody wanted to leave before
they were supposed to?


370
00:31:05.182 --> 00:31:06.416
I don't know, to be honest.

371
00:31:06.751 --> 00:31:08.552
I've always been really good
to my employees.


372
00:31:09.553 --> 00:31:11.789
I guess you'd call it
a breach of notice.


373
00:31:11.823 --> 00:31:13.257
Or a breach of contract.

374
00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:15.693
Hmm.

375
00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:19.196
What's wrong, Lionel?

376
00:31:20.798 --> 00:31:21.632
Hm?

377
00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:25.135
Well, it's my roommate.

378
00:31:25.469 --> 00:31:30.140
We're friends, and last night
we took it to the next level.


379
00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:33.745
And after that, I'd definitely
say that we're closer.


380
00:31:33.778 --> 00:31:36.480
So there's this undeniable level
of spiritual trust


381
00:31:36.513 --> 00:31:38.816
and understanding, you see?

382
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.618
And I worked so hard to get him
to bare his soul to me,
and I reciprocated.


383
00:31:42.386 --> 00:31:44.756
And after all that was done,
we went to bed.


384
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:47.190
And in the morning,
I got up and found out that


385
00:31:47.224 --> 00:31:48.625
the son of a bitch
had almost left me


386
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.460
in the middle of
the goddamn night!


387
00:31:55.867 --> 00:31:56.701
What?

388
00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:02.472
I think you should speak to him.

389
00:32:03.607 --> 00:32:05.108
Tell him how you really feel.

390
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.344
Yeah.

391
00:32:07.879 --> 00:32:09.781
You know what?
I think I will.


392
00:32:11.415 --> 00:32:12.382
Hey, Lionel!

393
00:32:14.284 --> 00:32:17.454
Don't be ashamed of what you
are. We all like what we like.


394
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.224
Hmm.

395
00:32:21.826 --> 00:32:23.393
Oh, hey.

396
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:28.833
I don't suppose you want
a selection of lamps, do you?


397
00:32:29.499 --> 00:32:30.467
Erm, no.

398
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.335
(Lionel scoffs)

399
00:32:48.185 --> 00:32:49.119
Lionel?

400
00:33:43.473 --> 00:33:44.307
Fuck!

401
00:33:44.508 --> 00:33:45.542
What's that now?

402
00:33:49.513 --> 00:33:52.784
Just erm, checking on Bermuna.

403
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:54.686
Bermuda.

404
00:33:55.252 --> 00:33:56.186
Have a seat, Jed.

405
00:34:12.269 --> 00:34:13.537
OK. Hold on, hold on.

406
00:34:22.646 --> 00:34:24.481
Here. Kettle corn.

407
00:34:24.514 --> 00:34:26.383
Look, I just felt bad

408
00:34:26.416 --> 00:34:28.618
and I just wanted to let
you know that I'm sorry, OK?


409
00:34:28.653 --> 00:34:30.454
And I am sorry.

410
00:34:30.722 --> 00:34:34.324
I just hope you know
that I didn't mean
to upset you, Lionel-


411
00:34:34.357 --> 00:34:34.992
-LIE.

412
00:34:36.593 --> 00:34:38.495
-I just. I feel terrible!
-Jed.


413
00:34:43.668 --> 00:34:45.235
This is not the way, buddy.

414
00:34:51.608 --> 00:34:52.542
What happened?

415
00:34:55.545 --> 00:34:58.548
Honestly, I just thought
all of this would have gone
down a lot...


416
00:34:59.684 --> 00:35:00.650
quicker.

417
00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:04.856
I kind of just want
it over with now.


418
00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.498
Well,

419
00:35:14.531 --> 00:35:15.767
(Clears throat)

420
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.001
in the spirit of
speading things up,


421
00:35:18.468 --> 00:35:19.469
Go ahead,

422
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.839
lay out your arm.

423
00:35:38.488 --> 00:35:40.892
Two more days, tops. OK?

424
00:36:04.916 --> 00:36:05.950
Are you ready?

425
00:36:11.722 --> 00:36:12.622
No!

426
00:36:15.425 --> 00:36:16.459
Yes.

427
00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:30.440
Whoa whoa whoa,
STOP, STOP, FUCK!


428
00:36:30.473 --> 00:36:33.643
STOP, STOP, STOP, IT'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO FUCKING HURT!


429
00:36:34.078 --> 00:36:35.146
FUCK!

430
00:36:35.179 --> 00:36:36.446
(Screaming)

431
00:36:37.014 --> 00:36:38.481
FUCK! LIONEL, STOP IT!

432
00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:40.383
WHAT'S THAT NOW?

433
00:36:40.417 --> 00:36:41.686
FUCK!

434
00:36:42.519 --> 00:36:43.855
(Jed shrieks)

435
00:36:44.155 --> 00:36:46.389
FUCK, LIONEL. STOP!

436
00:36:46.423 --> 00:36:47.792
I CAN'T STOP, JED!

437
00:36:47.825 --> 00:36:49.927
I NEED TO REMOVE THE
ARM TO CAUTERIZE IT!


438
00:36:50.194 --> 00:36:51.394
(Screaming)

439
00:36:51.428 --> 00:36:53.130
CAD 7842. Mr Lionel Flack.

440
00:36:53.164 --> 00:36:54.966
Triple one alpha Quilter House.

441
00:36:54.999 --> 00:36:57.500
Sierra, echo, two, five, one,
hotel, zulu.


442
00:36:57.534 --> 00:37:01.105
A Mrs Mary Huggins reported
screams coming from within
the property.


443
00:37:01.138 --> 00:37:02.539
Yeah, received and en route.

444
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.541
(Jed screams)

445
00:37:04.574 --> 00:37:06.643
OH, GOD!

446
00:37:06.878 --> 00:37:09.379
FUCK, LIONEL. STOP!

447
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.019
(Screaming)

448
00:37:15.052 --> 00:37:17.054
TAKE YOUR PILLS, YOU SHIT.

449
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:20.590
HOLD ON, JED!

450
00:37:29.033 --> 00:37:30.101
(Jed whimpering)

451
00:37:31.969 --> 00:37:33.037
(Jed shrieks)

452
00:37:34.939 --> 00:37:35.840
Drink this.

453
00:37:37.174 --> 00:37:38.009
Drink this.

454
00:37:38.541 --> 00:37:39.143
Drink that, buddy.

455
00:37:39.176 --> 00:37:40.044
There you are.

456
00:37:40.244 --> 00:37:41.411
Got some more, here you are.

457
00:37:41.645 --> 00:37:42.512
Yeah, buddy.

458
00:37:44.148 --> 00:37:45.182
I NEED TO FINISH, JED!

459
00:37:45.582 --> 00:37:46.717
(Screaming)

460
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:48.052
NEARLY THERE!

461
00:37:48.085 --> 00:37:50.121
FUCK! PLEASE HURRY THE FUCK UP!

462
00:37:51.621 --> 00:37:53.057
I'M ALMOST THERE, YOU SHIT!

463
00:37:56.794 --> 00:37:58.195
PLEASE!

464
00:38:03.134 --> 00:38:04.735
(Flesh tearing)

465
00:38:05.836 --> 00:38:07.772
OH, GOD!

466
00:38:09.106 --> 00:38:11.208
FUCK! STOP! STOP! STOP!

467
00:38:11.842 --> 00:38:14.078
HURRY THE FUCK UP!

468
00:38:14.111 --> 00:38:16.948
PLEASE!

469
00:38:19.116 --> 00:38:20.517
(Lionel panting)

470
00:38:25.256 --> 00:38:27.191
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

471
00:38:27.758 --> 00:38:31.062
WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY!

472
00:38:34.098 --> 00:38:35.199
(Hissing)

473
00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:37.567
That's my boy.

474
00:38:38.102 --> 00:38:39.636
That's my baby!

475
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:40.771
(Lionel chuckles)

476
00:39:14.705 --> 00:39:18.676
You're gonna be one crispy
little piece of shit.


477
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.178
Mmm.

478
00:40:04.688 --> 00:40:07.291
(British accent)
Well, fuck me, you taste great.


479
00:40:35.252 --> 00:40:37.021
You are what you eat, Jed.

480
00:40:41.192 --> 00:40:42.827
We're top of the food chain.

481
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.934
And if we are what we eat,

482
00:40:51.235 --> 00:40:55.806
then why would we want to be
anything less than human?


483
00:40:59.076 --> 00:41:03.747
And I want that reflection.

484
00:43:08.872 --> 00:43:10.975
(He whimpers)

485
00:43:52.216 --> 00:43:53.117
(Knocking)

486
00:43:54.218 --> 00:43:56.220
Hello, this is the Police.
Can you open up please?


487
00:44:21.578 --> 00:44:23.347
Are you Mr Lionel Flack, sir?

488
00:44:23.947 --> 00:44:24.848
Come again?

489
00:44:25.249 --> 00:44:26.450
Are you Lionel Flack?

490
00:44:27.251 --> 00:44:28.218
Yes ma'am.

491
00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:30.187
What can I do for you?

492
00:44:30.587 --> 00:44:32.489
Would you mind if we
come in for a moment?


493
00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:34.858
Erm.

494
00:44:35.159 --> 00:44:36.026
Sure.

495
00:44:36.661 --> 00:44:37.995
Come on in.

496
00:44:43.934 --> 00:44:45.402
What's this all about, officers?

497
00:44:45.436 --> 00:44:47.471
We are sorry to be
bothering you so late, sir,


498
00:44:47.504 --> 00:44:50.874
but we've been anonymously
alerted of a cause for concern


499
00:44:50.908 --> 00:44:52.376
regarding a noise complaint.

500
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.244
Well, look at me.

501
00:44:54.945 --> 00:44:55.846
I'm fine.

502
00:44:56.613 --> 00:44:58.315
No cause for concern here.

503
00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.285
Do you live alone, Mr Flack?

504
00:45:01.318 --> 00:45:02.152
Sorry?

505
00:45:03.554 --> 00:45:04.521
Do you live alone?

506
00:45:04.922 --> 00:45:07.157
Yes ma'am, I do.

507
00:45:07.191 --> 00:45:09.860
So there's nobody else here
that can account for
the reported screaming?


508
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.028
Screaming?

509
00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:15.566
Listen...

510
00:45:15.999 --> 00:45:18.335
if you're anonymous call
came from downstairs,


511
00:45:18.369 --> 00:45:22.539
then I can tell you now that she
has had it in for me since day
one.


512
00:45:23.073 --> 00:45:25.609
Everything is fine,
and as it happens,


513
00:45:25.642 --> 00:45:27.478
Everything is fine,
and as it happens, I was about
to turn in for the night.


514
00:45:28.178 --> 00:45:32.182
But I did watch a movie earlier
and I'm hard of hearing,
see? So,


515
00:45:33.117 --> 00:45:34.485
that's probably what it was.

516
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.121
Fair enough.

517
00:45:38.555 --> 00:45:41.959
Well, if we can just keep
the noise down and we can keep
the peace, yeah?


518
00:45:41.992 --> 00:45:43.227
Absolutely, ma'am.

519
00:45:43.427 --> 00:45:44.595
Can I use your loo?

520
00:45:44.628 --> 00:45:46.163
-What's that now?
-The bathroom.


521
00:45:47.531 --> 00:45:48.365
Uh

522
00:45:49.667 --> 00:45:50.501
Sure.

523
00:45:50.702 --> 00:45:51.535
Yeah.

524
00:45:52.202 --> 00:45:53.971
Last door on the right.

525
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.468
So, you're American, huh?

526
00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.171
Yessir, born and raised.

527
00:46:29.239 --> 00:46:30.140
Texas?

528
00:46:30.574 --> 00:46:32.476
I travelled around a lot.

529
00:46:36.013 --> 00:46:37.448
I thought you said
you were going to bed?


530
00:46:40.517 --> 00:46:41.552
I am

531
00:46:42.152 --> 00:46:44.288
and this is my home...

532
00:46:44.621 --> 00:46:50.227
and I can clean up
whenever I see fit,
thank you Mr kind officer, sir.


533
00:46:53.597 --> 00:46:54.565
What is it?

534
00:46:58.135 --> 00:46:59.704
That is a

535
00:47:01.271 --> 00:47:02.539
mild veal,

536
00:47:03.273 --> 00:47:06.143
with a raspberry coulis,

537
00:47:06.176 --> 00:47:10.080
straight from the Captain's
quarters of the Cutty Sark.


538
00:47:10.314 --> 00:47:11.683
(Laughing nervously)

539
00:48:04.669 --> 00:48:06.603
Fuck me, come on, Sarge.

540
00:48:06.637 --> 00:48:09.707
This is the best veal
I have ever tasted.


541
00:48:10.307 --> 00:48:12.442
No, honestly, you
have to try it.


542
00:48:12.744 --> 00:48:13.610
You have to.

543
00:48:27.357 --> 00:48:29.059
This is not veal.

544
00:48:35.733 --> 00:48:38.468
This is Michelin Star veal.

545
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:40.838
What do you do, Mr
Flake, are you a chef?


546
00:48:40.872 --> 00:48:42.105
It's 'Flack'.

547
00:48:42.139 --> 00:48:43.340
and I own a boating company.

548
00:48:43.775 --> 00:48:45.677
You're in the wrong
profession, mate.


549
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:46.343
Duly noted.

550
00:48:47.311 --> 00:48:49.146
Thank you for your time, love.

551
00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:52.182
Apologies for the... Well,
disturbing your evening and...


552
00:48:52.917 --> 00:48:53.751
Yep (giggles).

553
00:48:57.354 --> 00:48:58.589
That's really good.

554
00:49:04.294 --> 00:49:05.663
Let me get that for you.

555
00:49:08.766 --> 00:49:09.667
All the best, mate.

556
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:12.636
You take care, now.

557
00:49:13.403 --> 00:49:14.504
Aww, you too Mr Flack-

558
00:49:14.538 --> 00:49:15.372
(Door slams)

559
00:49:33.925 --> 00:49:35.392
What happened to your arm?

560
00:49:38.796 --> 00:49:39.731
You.

561
00:49:44.635 --> 00:49:45.569
Lie?

562
00:49:51.274 --> 00:49:52.242
Lionels?

563
00:49:57.581 --> 00:49:58.448
You OK?

564
00:50:01.218 --> 00:50:02.319
(Grunting)

565
00:50:08.726 --> 00:50:09.694
Could be better.

566
00:50:21.906 --> 00:50:23.507
Forgive me Jed, but-

567
00:50:25.743 --> 00:50:27.879
I look at somebody like you,

568
00:50:28.846 --> 00:50:30.682
and you did it all, man.

569
00:50:30.715 --> 00:50:36.386
You met a girl, you fell in
love, you got married, man.


570
00:50:36.754 --> 00:50:38.488
You went the whole nine yards.

571
00:50:39.489 --> 00:50:41.425
What's your fucking secret, man?

572
00:50:41.893 --> 00:50:44.696
I guess the secret is
to have no secrets.


573
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:47.765
Goddamn it.

574
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.268
Yeah, you have a pretty
big fucking secret, Lionel.


575
00:50:51.301 --> 00:50:52.602
I know, yeah.

576
00:50:53.738 --> 00:50:55.840
I mean, there's nothing more
beautiful than a man's


577
00:50:55.873 --> 00:50:57.909
relationship with his food.

578
00:50:58.743 --> 00:51:00.878
I mean, in moderation.

579
00:51:00.912 --> 00:51:02.345
Well, how about love?

580
00:51:04.448 --> 00:51:07.284
You know, trusting and
loving oneself enough


581
00:51:07.317 --> 00:51:11.756
to not even think twice about
what the other person feels
about you.


582
00:51:13.323 --> 00:51:15.727
You know, 'radiating
happiness'.


583
00:51:16.728 --> 00:51:17.561
Right?

584
00:51:27.537 --> 00:51:28.706
Touché, Jed.

585
00:51:30.474 --> 00:51:31.042
(Glasses clink)

586
00:51:31.075 --> 00:51:32.242
Touché.

587
00:51:40.852 --> 00:51:45.555
So, is there a Mrs
Flack in the running?


588
00:51:45.823 --> 00:51:48.726
I barely introduced myself
to the last one.


589
00:51:49.894 --> 00:51:53.296
She lost her head
and went cold on me.


590
00:51:59.804 --> 00:52:01.404
Go and get your camera for me.

591
00:52:01.739 --> 00:52:02.572
Huh?

592
00:52:02.774 --> 00:52:04.307
I'm gonna find you a girl.

593
00:52:04.742 --> 00:52:05.710
Or a guy-

594
00:52:05.743 --> 00:52:06.878
Or a guy-
-A girl.


595
00:52:07.912 --> 00:52:09.279
Well, go and get it then.

596
00:52:09.546 --> 00:52:10.715
(And then we pose)

597
00:52:15.652 --> 00:52:17.320
-Whoa whoa whoa, what are you
doing? -What?


598
00:52:17.688 --> 00:52:19.924
Unless you want a dick pic
as your profile picture,


599
00:52:19.957 --> 00:52:22.059
I suggest you go and get
your best get-up on.


600
00:52:22.592 --> 00:52:23.795
Well, what is that?

601
00:52:24.594 --> 00:52:25.997
Well, how the fuck am I-

602
00:52:26.596 --> 00:52:27.631
(Jed groans)

603
00:52:28.598 --> 00:52:30.001
Just be yourself.

604
00:52:31.869 --> 00:52:32.703
(Pose)

605
00:52:35.572 --> 00:52:37.374
You can do better
than that, mate.


606
00:52:39.476 --> 00:52:41.344
Come on. No. No. No. No.

607
00:52:41.712 --> 00:52:43.580
Find something else.

608
00:52:45.482 --> 00:52:46.751
What the fuck is that?

609
00:52:46.784 --> 00:52:48.820
-No?
-Oh, for the love of God.


610
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.021
OK, look.

611
00:52:50.487 --> 00:52:53.024
Go into my duffle
bag, the grey one.


612
00:52:53.623 --> 00:52:56.861
In there, you'll find
a blue polo neck.


613
00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.328
Put that on.

614
00:53:03.567 --> 00:53:05.335
Tell you what, lose
the glasses for me.


615
00:53:17.048 --> 00:53:18.082
Eh, good enough.

616
00:53:22.652 --> 00:53:23.486
(Camera clicks)

617
00:53:32.063 --> 00:53:33.530
Let's get one of you and me.

618
00:53:43.941 --> 00:53:44.775
(Jed groans)

619
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.513
(Camera clicks)

620
00:54:02.927 --> 00:54:04.762
Tomorrow's a big day, brother.

621
00:54:05.029 --> 00:54:07.698
I need you to get some sleep
and be clear headed, OK?


622
00:54:08.199 --> 00:54:09.100
I'm on it.

623
00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.600
Attaboy.

624
00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.036
(Ominous music)

625
00:55:03.586 --> 00:55:04.822
(Footsteps approaching)

626
00:55:06.023 --> 00:55:08.025
Rise and shine city slicker!

627
00:55:08.059 --> 00:55:10.194
Meet me in the living room
in five minutes.


628
00:55:10.593 --> 00:55:11.729
We're going out.

629
00:55:12.263 --> 00:55:13.097
(Door slams)

630
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:14.165
(Jed groans)

631
00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:25.475
(Phone ringing)

632
00:55:31.115 --> 00:55:31.949
Flack!

633
00:55:32.149 --> 00:55:33.516
You forgot your fish tin.

634
00:55:34.318 --> 00:55:35.485
Who is this?

635
00:55:35.987 --> 00:55:36.821
It's Alex.

636
00:55:37.154 --> 00:55:38.521
Oh! (chuckles nervously)

637
00:55:38.923 --> 00:55:41.225
So, erm, did you tell him?

638
00:55:41.959 --> 00:55:43.794
Did I tell who what?

639
00:55:43.828 --> 00:55:45.863
Your boyfriend. Did you tell
him how you feel about him?


640
00:55:48.165 --> 00:55:50.801
Alex, I'm not gay.

641
00:55:51.702 --> 00:55:52.737
You're not?

642
00:55:53.004 --> 00:55:55.605
No, I... I think you
misunderstood me.


643
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.641
In fact, I think we both
misunderstood each other,


644
00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:00.077
if I'm honest.

645
00:56:00.811 --> 00:56:02.713
I'm so confused right now.

646
00:56:04.949 --> 00:56:06.649
Can I take you out
for dinner tonight?


647
00:56:09.353 --> 00:56:10.620
What? Like a-

648
00:56:11.055 --> 00:56:12.056
-like a date?

649
00:56:13.024 --> 00:56:14.191
Yeah, Lionel. Like a date.

650
00:56:17.695 --> 00:56:18.528
Huh.

651
00:56:18.996 --> 00:56:20.097
Well, I'll be damned.

652
00:56:21.098 --> 00:56:23.734
Yeah! Hows about 6pm tonight
at Geeman's Lair?


653
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:26.170
That sounds perfect.

654
00:56:26.603 --> 00:56:27.238
See you tonight?

655
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.708
Lionel?

656
00:56:30.741 --> 00:56:33.643
Yeah. Erm. Six.

657
00:56:33.677 --> 00:56:34.611
Six you tonight!

658
00:56:35.913 --> 00:56:36.747
(Phone beeps)

659
00:56:37.281 --> 00:56:38.115
Love you.

660
00:56:45.089 --> 00:56:46.556
Where are we going?

661
00:56:47.792 --> 00:56:48.826
Get in the chair.

662
00:57:06.744 --> 00:57:08.946
So, how far is it?

663
00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:22.760
Now, with your whistles,
I need you all to show me


664
00:57:22.793 --> 00:57:25.162
what to do in the
event of an emergency.


665
00:57:27.832 --> 00:57:28.666
(He blows his whistle)

666
00:57:32.903 --> 00:57:34.939
(They all blow their whistles)

667
00:57:38.909 --> 00:57:39.777
Excellent!

668
00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:41.946
Now, let's hit the water.

669
00:57:42.213 --> 00:57:46.050
You guys, single file onto the
boat, and Jed, you're with me.


670
00:57:54.425 --> 00:57:56.060
Hey! Come here, now.

671
00:58:14.345 --> 00:58:15.179
What?

672
00:58:16.046 --> 00:58:17.248
Well, look at them.

673
00:58:18.449 --> 00:58:20.117
You know, they've been dealt
the worst hand in the world,


674
00:58:20.151 --> 00:58:22.987
yet their just happy.

675
00:58:24.889 --> 00:58:26.190
It's beautiful, isn't it?

676
00:58:28.425 --> 00:58:29.860
I want that.

677
00:58:31.162 --> 00:58:33.264
I guess you don't know what you
have until it's actually gone.


678
00:58:36.767 --> 00:58:37.401
Jed

679
00:58:38.502 --> 00:58:39.837
you've got me.

680
00:58:40.838 --> 00:58:41.939
Yeah, great.

681
00:58:50.014 --> 00:58:51.815
BOYS AND GIRLS, LISTEN UP!

682
00:58:51.849 --> 00:58:53.184
Fuck. Lionel, what the fuck?

683
00:58:53.217 --> 00:58:55.186
There comes a time
in every man's life


684
00:58:55.219 --> 00:58:58.255
where he unexpectedly finds
himself in a hole.


685
00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:01.225
Of course, the man usually has
a good woman


686
00:59:01.258 --> 00:59:02.359
or a FRIEND...

687
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.196
...to pull himself
out of the hole


688
00:59:05.229 --> 00:59:08.265
before it fills up with horse
shit and he's left to die.


689
00:59:08.766 --> 00:59:09.733
He's alone.

690
00:59:11.302 --> 00:59:12.169
Abandoned.

691
00:59:13.037 --> 00:59:15.372
Ain't nobody but
himself to save himself.


692
00:59:15.906 --> 00:59:18.309
SURVIVAL ONE 'O' FUCKING ONE!

693
00:59:18.809 --> 00:59:20.010
(GUNSHOT)

694
00:59:20.044 --> 00:59:21.712
-Lionel, what the fuck?
-WHOO!


695
00:59:22.012 --> 00:59:23.047
You're gonna kill them!

696
00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.381
Oh, they know what to do.

697
00:59:24.949 --> 00:59:26.750
They're frightened!

698
00:59:26.784 --> 00:59:27.851
You're just gonna let them
drown, we have to save them!


699
00:59:27.885 --> 00:59:29.186
THEY KNOW WHAT TO FUCKING DO!

700
00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.054
LIONEL!

701
01:00:02.419 --> 01:00:06.790
Is this everything you thought
it would be?


702
01:00:13.297 --> 01:00:15.032
(Ominous music)

703
01:00:34.084 --> 01:00:35.953
(Pulsing)

704
01:00:36.587 --> 01:00:38.222
(Thunderous clap)
(Rain thudding)


705
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.494
Wake up.

706
01:00:44.194 --> 01:00:45.462
(Spluttering)

707
01:00:46.497 --> 01:00:47.798
(Coughing)

708
01:00:52.303 --> 01:00:53.137
Get ready.

709
01:01:11.055 --> 01:01:13.157
Get up.

710
01:01:23.534 --> 01:01:24.468
That was cruel.

711
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:26.136
What's that now?

712
01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:27.604
I SAID YOU WERE FUCKING CRUEL.

713
01:01:27.638 --> 01:01:30.407
Oh, I was never
gonna kill them, Jed.


714
01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:32.643
I saw you.

715
01:01:32.677 --> 01:01:36.013
I watched you while I was down
there. You just stood there
and watched.


716
01:01:36.246 --> 01:01:39.550
You left me there to die and
you loved every second of it.


717
01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:42.486
That's what you wanted
though, right? Is it not?


718
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.522
To die? YOU CAME
HERE TO DIE, JED.


719
01:01:45.556 --> 01:01:49.259
No. I am done, Lionel.

720
01:01:51.061 --> 01:01:53.130
I'm out.
I'm going home.


721
01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:57.534
You are bound by a contract.

722
01:01:57.935 --> 01:01:59.970
FUCK YOUR CONTRACT!

723
01:02:00.672 --> 01:02:02.339
I see you now.

724
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.955
And what do you see?

725
01:02:18.288 --> 01:02:23.394
A sad, scared, lonely little boy

726
01:02:23.427 --> 01:02:27.097
who just wants
his fucking mommy.


727
01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.035
You're nothing more
than a predator,


728
01:02:33.637 --> 01:02:38.008
consuming everything
that you wish you could be.


729
01:02:39.276 --> 01:02:41.345
And underneath that...

730
01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.281
A child

731
01:02:45.717 --> 01:02:47.918
starved of love.

732
01:02:48.552 --> 01:02:53.323
You feed off the weak, Lionel.
You are a coward.


733
01:02:56.728 --> 01:02:58.195
Say that again.

734
01:03:01.565 --> 01:03:03.133
I dare you.

735
01:03:06.437 --> 01:03:09.106
You... are...

736
01:03:09.139 --> 01:03:11.275
a FUCKING COWARD.

737
01:03:15.279 --> 01:03:16.146
FUCK!

738
01:03:22.286 --> 01:03:23.187
Now,

739
01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:27.558
some cultures believe
that torturing the animal alive


740
01:03:27.591 --> 01:03:30.961
improves the taste
and the quality of the meat.


741
01:03:31.495 --> 01:03:35.299
That's why today, I'm gonna
give you something new.


742
01:03:38.368 --> 01:03:40.571
Although you won't be
able to move an inch,


743
01:03:41.171 --> 01:03:44.107
the anesthetic properties
are not so great.


744
01:03:45.108 --> 01:03:48.612
YOU ARE GONNA FEEL EVERY
LAST FUCKING BIT OF THIS!


745
01:03:54.318 --> 01:03:55.219
(Jed shrieks)

746
01:04:00.224 --> 01:04:01.759
(Thumping)

747
01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:36.493
(Sadistic laughing)

748
01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:55.279
You need some time to cool off
and think about your goddamn
actions.


749
01:04:58.181 --> 01:04:59.416
(Door slams and locks)

750
01:05:02.119 --> 01:05:03.721
(Illegible murmering)

751
01:05:04.154 --> 01:05:05.522
(Glass smashing)

752
01:05:09.259 --> 01:05:11.061
(Clambering)

753
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:26.577
It's shit.

754
01:05:27.912 --> 01:05:29.580
It's shit.

755
01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.561
(Lionel sobs)

756
01:05:48.599 --> 01:05:50.300
(Bellowing screams)

757
01:05:54.504 --> 01:05:56.206
(Smashing)

758
01:06:02.346 --> 01:06:03.213
FUCK YOU!

759
01:06:04.181 --> 01:06:05.115
FUCK YOU!

760
01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:07.517
(Phone ringing)

761
01:06:07.719 --> 01:06:08.853
YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

762
01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.755
YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

763
01:06:11.521 --> 01:06:13.891
YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT

764
01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:15.492
(He screams)

765
01:06:18.896 --> 01:06:20.263
(Phone ringing)

766
01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:24.167
(Machine beeps)

767
01:06:24.201 --> 01:06:25.803
(Alex) Hey you.

768
01:06:27.437 --> 01:06:28.106
(Alex) I just wanted to say
that I'm really looking forward
to dinner and erm,


769
01:06:28.138 --> 01:06:29.741
(Alex) yeah I love that place.

770
01:06:29.774 --> 01:06:31.809
(Illegible murmering)

771
01:06:33.778 --> 01:06:35.312
(Alex) I'm really sorry
that I got the wrong-


772
01:06:35.345 --> 01:06:36.714
-end of the stick the other day.

773
01:06:36.748 --> 01:06:39.216
(Alex) I'm such an idiot
sometimes.


774
01:06:39.951 --> 01:06:43.420
(Alex) Actually, all the time,
but yeah, you'll find that out
on your own.


775
01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:47.157
(Alex) Anyway, yeah.
I'll see you tonight at six.


776
01:06:47.959 --> 01:06:49.459
(Alex) Yeah, really looking
forward to it.


777
01:06:50.594 --> 01:06:52.295
(Alex) I already said that,
but OK.


778
01:06:52.864 --> 01:06:54.431
(Alex) Yeah, bye. See you.

779
01:06:54.766 --> 01:06:55.599
(Machine beeps)

780
01:06:57.567 --> 01:07:01.538
FUCK YOU.

781
01:07:05.977 --> 01:07:07.444
(Grunting)

782
01:07:08.645 --> 01:07:10.347
(Illegible murmering)

783
01:07:12.416 --> 01:07:13.751
It's cold on there.

784
01:07:14.886 --> 01:07:16.586
(Illegible murmering)

785
01:07:17.889 --> 01:07:19.589
(Panting)

786
01:08:41.438 --> 01:08:42.506
Are you ready to order, love?

787
01:08:42.539 --> 01:08:44.041
I'm still waiting for my-

788
01:08:44.075 --> 01:08:46.643
-Oh I'm so sorry I'm late.
So sorry.


789
01:08:46.677 --> 01:08:48.411
No worries, I'll give
you guys a moment.


790
01:08:48.645 --> 01:08:49.346
Thank you.

791
01:08:49.379 --> 01:08:49.947
Thanks.

792
01:08:50.681 --> 01:08:51.581
Hi-
-Hi


793
01:08:51.615 --> 01:08:52.582
(Nervous laughter)

794
01:09:26.583 --> 01:09:30.922
I told him, I said, look buddy,
I've known you for like
forever, and-


795
01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:34.692
-I put you up, and I've given
you the clothes off my back,
and-


796
01:09:34.725 --> 01:09:37.394
-Hell, I've practically been
to hell and back with you.


797
01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:40.932
And I just said "just
talk to me, man".


798
01:09:41.666 --> 01:09:42.700
And what did he say?

799
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.568
He didn't.

800
01:09:46.436 --> 01:09:49.472
They found him by her
grave stone the next day.


801
01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:52.609
Oh my God, Lionel I'm so sorry.

802
01:09:53.778 --> 01:09:55.478
That must've been
really hard for you.


803
01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:16.767
(They both giggle)

804
01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:27.510
How about we finish up here

805
01:10:27.544 --> 01:10:29.512
and head to my
place for dessert?


806
01:10:34.685 --> 01:10:36.486
(Nervous laughter)

807
01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.494
Well, if you are.

808
01:10:47.798 --> 01:10:49.000
Tastes so much
better, doesn't it?


809
01:10:49.033 --> 01:10:50.533
Mmm, I know it does.

810
01:10:51.936 --> 01:10:55.039
So, erm. Now that manners
are out the window...


811
01:10:57.141 --> 01:10:58.676
Are you into anything weird?

812
01:11:03.613 --> 01:11:04.514
Like what?

813
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.983
Erm.

814
01:11:07.718 --> 01:11:08.786
Sexual or-

815
01:11:08.819 --> 01:11:11.188
-Oh, no. No, not neccesarily.

816
01:11:12.522 --> 01:11:13.523
As an example,

817
01:11:14.825 --> 01:11:16.093
When I go to the supermarket,

818
01:11:17.261 --> 01:11:20.164
I get this urge to take
things off the shelve


819
01:11:20.865 --> 01:11:22.499
and put them in other
people's baskets.


820
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.201
I find it really hilarious.

821
01:11:24.835 --> 01:11:25.703
That kind of stuff.

822
01:11:25.736 --> 01:11:28.172
OK, OK. So I, erm.

823
01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.473
Hmm

824
01:11:30.507 --> 01:11:33.144
I like to peel soap.

825
01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:34.879
Oh, that's a really good one.

826
01:11:46.757 --> 01:11:48.192
I like skin.

827
01:11:48.225 --> 01:11:49.492
Crispy chicken skin?

828
01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.662
I know what you mean.

829
01:11:51.696 --> 01:11:53.197
I absolutely love chicken skin.

830
01:11:53.230 --> 01:11:55.532
Anyone that doesn't like
crispy chicken skin is a weirdo.


831
01:11:56.233 --> 01:11:57.068
No.

832
01:11:58.635 --> 01:11:59.937
I like your skin.

833
01:12:00.637 --> 01:12:02.006
I wanna eat your skin.

834
01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:09.180
Erm. I mean. It's
just that I. Erm.


835
01:12:10.881 --> 01:12:12.549
I think you have beautiful skin.

836
01:12:16.787 --> 01:12:19.156
Will you just excuse
me for one minute?


837
01:12:39.609 --> 01:12:41.578
(High pitched ringing)

838
01:13:08.039 --> 01:13:08.873
(Alex Shrieks)

839
01:14:21.378 --> 01:14:22.313
Is this it?

840
01:14:22.847 --> 01:14:24.682
Only if you want it to be.

841
01:14:26.984 --> 01:14:28.618
Is this what you want?

842
01:14:30.688 --> 01:14:31.621
No.

843
01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:34.391
You don't belong here.

844
01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.028
We don't belong here, Jed.

845
01:14:40.764 --> 01:14:42.099
What am I supposed to do?

846
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.203
I don't stand a chance,
he's taken everything from me.


847
01:14:47.838 --> 01:14:49.306
Not everything.

848
01:14:57.781 --> 01:14:58.883
I love you.

849
01:15:04.788 --> 01:15:05.823
I know.

850
01:15:10.194 --> 01:15:11.695
I love you too.

851
01:15:14.431 --> 01:15:15.266
I know.

852
01:15:30.414 --> 01:15:31.081
(Door slams)

853
01:15:31.115 --> 01:15:32.816
(Panting)

854
01:15:48.165 --> 01:15:49.166
(Door knocking)

855
01:15:52.136 --> 01:15:53.337
Who is it?

856
01:15:53.771 --> 01:15:55.739
Police. Can we have
a word please, buddy?


857
01:16:03.214 --> 01:16:04.181
Mr Flack?

858
01:16:05.916 --> 01:16:07.151
Hold on!

859
01:16:07.184 --> 01:16:08.385
Is everything OK
in there, Mr Flack?


860
01:16:08.419 --> 01:16:09.453
Hold on.

861
01:16:18.095 --> 01:16:20.097
(Knocking) Could
you open up, please?


862
01:16:24.568 --> 01:16:25.402
Mr Flack?

863
01:16:31.408 --> 01:16:35.212
Apologies for disturbing you, we
just have a couple of questions.


864
01:16:39.416 --> 01:16:40.251
Flack...

865
01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.154
Could you open up, please?

866
01:16:53.998 --> 01:16:55.332
What can I do for
you two, officers?


867
01:16:57.868 --> 01:16:59.169
Mary Huggins,

868
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:01.538
aka downstairs?

869
01:17:01.972 --> 01:17:02.806
What about her?

870
01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.141
Reported missing.

871
01:17:04.908 --> 01:17:06.877
Do you mind if we come in
and take a look around, sir?


872
01:17:14.385 --> 01:17:15.419
Be my guest.

873
01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:24.928
Ah, man of many talents, are we?

874
01:17:26.497 --> 01:17:27.331
What's this then?

875
01:17:28.866 --> 01:17:29.500
Oh, that?

876
01:17:30.134 --> 01:17:30.968
(Laughs nervously)

877
01:17:31.935 --> 01:17:34.004
That is...

878
01:17:35.539 --> 01:17:38.509
That is, erm...

879
01:17:39.109 --> 01:17:41.378
My rendition of

880
01:17:41.412 --> 01:17:42.446
cubic

881
01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:44.882
abstract

882
01:17:45.549 --> 01:17:46.850
eroticism.

883
01:17:47.885 --> 01:17:49.253
Very good.

884
01:18:29.259 --> 01:18:31.328
What happened to your head?

885
01:18:33.964 --> 01:18:35.366
I shaved it.

886
01:18:36.934 --> 01:18:39.269
I got into a bit of a drunken
stupor with the work colleagues
last night,


887
01:18:39.303 --> 01:18:41.939
and you know,
hence all the mess.


888
01:18:44.041 --> 01:18:45.509
Boys will be boys, hey Officer?

889
01:18:49.513 --> 01:18:50.948
What we got cooking then, bud?

890
01:18:52.316 --> 01:18:53.984
Another Michelin special, is it?

891
01:18:55.687 --> 01:18:57.388
(Radio sounds)

892
01:18:57.421 --> 01:18:59.089
(Radio) Any available units
please make your way


893
01:18:59.123 --> 01:19:02.025
to Geemans Lair Restaurant,

894
01:19:02.059 --> 01:19:04.027
Male suspect wanted in
connection with the murder-


895
01:19:04.061 --> 01:19:05.663
-of a young women in
the ladies toilets.


896
01:19:05.697 --> 01:19:07.631
Yep, received. 78. Assign us.

897
01:19:07.665 --> 01:19:10.567
(Radio) Shown you assigned.
It's CAD 8127.


898
01:19:12.102 --> 01:19:13.170
(Grunting)

899
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:22.146
Now, you give us a call if you
hear anything, Mr Flack. OK?


900
01:19:22.179 --> 01:19:23.013
Of course.

901
01:19:38.162 --> 01:19:39.263
It's gonna be OK, mate.

902
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.502
We'll find somewhere
new, a new flat.


903
01:19:47.004 --> 01:19:48.706
Somewhere hot and wet.

904
01:19:49.173 --> 01:19:51.108
(Radio) Eye witness reported
the suspect turn into
Nielsen Street,


905
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:53.977
on foot, whereby a blonde wig
and tweed suit jacket-


906
01:19:54.011 --> 01:19:56.013
-were recovered.

907
01:19:56.046 --> 01:19:57.614
Officers on the scene are
scanning the CCTV of
the restaurant-


908
01:19:57.648 --> 01:20:00.117
-to get a better idea
of the suspect's whereabouts.


909
01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:02.219
The suspect is believed
to be American.


910
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:08.125
This is CAD 8032,

911

(Knocking)

913
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:19.236
Mr Flack?

914
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:20.738
Apologies, we just have
another couple of questions-


915
01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:22.005
-if you wouldn't mind?

916
01:20:34.719 --> 01:20:36.386
What is it?

917
01:20:37.689 --> 01:20:39.356
Didn't you have an
American accent?


918
01:20:42.827 --> 01:20:44.094
What's that now?

919
01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:47.665
Where were you
between 6 and 7 this evening?


920
01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:01.445

923
01:21:05.616 --> 01:21:07.518
Please! Hello?

924
01:21:08.151 --> 01:21:08.786
Help!

925
01:21:12.122 --> 01:21:14.391
(Footsteps approaching)

926
01:21:16.226 --> 01:21:18.328
Hello! This is the
Police. Who is that?


927
01:21:18.362 --> 01:21:21.498
Yes! Yes! Please.
My name is Jed Freeman.


928
01:21:21.532 --> 01:21:24.268
I've been taken prisoner
and he won't let me go.


929
01:21:24.568 --> 01:21:26.671
Please, he's gonna kill me,
please help me!


930
01:21:26.704 --> 01:21:29.674
Don't worry, sir. The
situation is now under control.


931
01:21:29.707 --> 01:21:31.308
You are no longer at risk.

932
01:21:31.743 --> 01:21:34.712
Now, for both mine
and your personal safety,


933
01:21:34.746 --> 01:21:37.347
I need to firstly ask
if there is anybody else-


934
01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:38.215
-in the room with you?

935
01:21:38.248 --> 01:21:39.483
No! No!

936
01:21:41.552 --> 01:21:45.522
Well, yes. But they're
all dead, Officer!


937
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:47.659
I'm sorry to hear that, Jed.

938
01:21:48.358 --> 01:21:50.327
We'll get you out
in just a second.


939
01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.629
Now, am I going to
find anything on you-


940
01:21:52.664 --> 01:21:54.732
-that would be considered
a dangerous weapon?


941
01:21:55.132 --> 01:21:56.668
No! Fuck sake!

942
01:21:56.701 --> 01:22:00.203
No, I'm tied up
and he's cut off my limbs!


943
01:22:00.237 --> 01:22:02.606
Please help me, 
I am dying here!

944
01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:06.343
Remain calm, Jed. 
I'm coming in.

945
01:22:06.778 --> 01:22:08.612
(Door rattles)

946
01:22:11.214 --> 01:22:12.482
It's locked, Jed.

947
01:22:12.516 --> 01:22:14.151
Do you know where
I might find a key?


948
01:22:14.451 --> 01:22:15.485
Check him!

949
01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:18.723
Maybe it's in his
pocket. Please!


950
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:23.828
(Keys rattling)

951
01:22:28.198 --> 01:22:29.166

953
01:22:37.942 --> 01:22:38.776
Hello?

956
01:22:43.347 --> 01:22:45.415
No, no, no, please!

957
01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:47.719
Lionel, I beg you, please!

958
01:22:47.952 --> 01:22:49.721
You don't have to
do this! No, no, no!


959
01:22:50.487 --> 01:22:52.222
Oh, God.

960
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:55.525
Come on, you don't have
to do this, Lionel.


961
01:22:57.695 --> 01:22:59.196
(Jed pants)

962
01:23:11.608 --> 01:23:12.643
Come on.

(Radio) CAD 8032.
Backup dispatched.


964
01:23:39.302 --> 01:23:40.437
Can you give us an update?

965
01:23:41.538 --> 01:23:42.639
They're coming for you.

966
01:23:43.708 --> 01:23:46.610
You've murdered two
of their Officers, come on!


967
01:23:46.643 --> 01:23:48.946
They're coming for you,
you're done now, please!


968
01:23:49.479 --> 01:23:50.414
(Radio breaks)

969
01:24:25.649 --> 01:24:27.617
It's not gonna help you, man.

970
01:24:39.563 --> 01:24:41.398
(Lionel quivers)

971
01:24:50.675 --> 01:24:51.541
(Gun clicks)

972
01:25:02.053 --> 01:25:03.420
Thank you, Jed.

973

(Gun loading)

974
01:25:30.347 --> 01:25:30.982
Fuck!

975
01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:34.384
This is the Police! Open up!

976
01:25:34.786 --> 01:25:38.956
Oh my God, oh my God,
thank God you're here.


977
01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.896
Try to remain calm, Sir.

978
01:25:44.929 --> 01:25:46.563
Tell me what happened.

979
01:25:46.596 --> 01:25:48.766
He fucking kidnapped me, man!

980
01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.468
He's a lying,
manipulative snake!


981
01:25:51.501 --> 01:25:52.703
Slow down, come on, now.

982
01:25:52.737 --> 01:25:53.771
It's OK.

983
01:25:53.805 --> 01:25:55.372
Just tell me what happened.

984
01:25:55.405 --> 01:25:57.507
It's going to be OK.

985
01:25:57.708 --> 01:26:00.044
He kept me against my will.

986
01:26:01.045 --> 01:26:03.681
He's killed others,
he's got them in the back room,


987
01:26:03.714 --> 01:26:05.482
I can show you.

988
01:26:05.515 --> 01:26:07.985
That's OK, son. You never
have to go in that room again.


989
01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.488
Just tell me where
the man is that did this to you.


990
01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:20.564
HE'S OVER THERE!

991
01:26:21.666 --> 01:26:25.903
Poor, lost soul shot himself
right after he shot me.


992
01:26:31.508 --> 01:26:32.076
(Gunshot)

993
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:32.710
(Lionel screams)

994
01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:33.878
FUCK!

995
01:26:35.179 --> 01:26:37.581
(Whimpering)

996
01:26:44.956 --> 01:26:47.892
(Screaming)

997
01:26:52.663 --> 01:26:53.430
Lionel?

998
01:26:53.463 --> 01:26:54.031
(Lionel shrieks)

999
01:26:54.065 --> 01:26:54.899
(He screams)

1000
01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:56.767
Lionel!

1001
01:27:05.877 --> 01:27:07.044
It's not gonna work.

1002
01:27:09.446 --> 01:27:10.413
Look at me.

1003
01:28:27.825 --> 01:28:31.929
Is it hard to see the world
from inside the bowl?


1004
01:28:33.998 --> 01:28:34.932
To be honest,

1005
01:28:36.167 --> 01:28:38.869
I don't know
what side of the glass I'm on.


1006
01:28:40.570 --> 01:28:42.572
You think you're
talking to Bermuda?


1007
01:28:45.309 --> 01:28:47.845
Bermuda's dead, Lionel.

1008
01:29:11.601 --> 01:29:13.104
I didn't wanna see you hurt,

1009
01:29:15.272 --> 01:29:17.008
so I got you a new one.

1010
01:29:43.633 --> 01:29:44.634
Hey

1011
01:29:46.137 --> 01:29:47.071
can we...

1012
01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:51.142
Can we just...

1013
01:29:53.778 --> 01:29:54.712
Can we just-

1014
01:29:56.347 --> 01:29:58.682
-sit and eat?

1015
01:29:59.316 --> 01:30:00.617
Please.

1016
01:30:01.819 --> 01:30:02.787
Please.

1017
01:30:20.137 --> 01:30:20.971
Jed.

1018
01:30:25.009 --> 01:30:26.576
I am so,

1019
01:30:27.078 --> 01:30:27.745
so sorry-

1020
01:30:27.778 --> 01:30:28.611
-L'CHAIM!

1021
01:30:36.854 --> 01:30:38.956
(Grunting)

1022
01:30:43.194 --> 01:30:45.796
(Panting)

1023
01:31:09.153 --> 01:31:10.287
(Grunting)

1024
01:31:14.258 --> 01:31:15.860
(Grunting)

1025
01:31:21.799 --> 01:31:22.632
Come on.

1026
01:31:57.801 --> 01:31:58.802
Fuck.

1027
01:32:10.047 --> 01:32:11.715
You can let me go, now.

1028
01:32:18.789 --> 01:32:20.257
(Distant sirens)

1029
01:32:31.235 --> 01:32:33.370
(Jed laughs)

1030
01:32:41.178 --> 01:32:43.314
(Distant sirens approaching)

1031
01:32:46.517 --> 01:32:48.452
(Jed laughs)
