2
00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:27.069
Pull your socks up
and get to work.


3
00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:31.740
By Jove,
it says I will be robbed.


4
00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:34.576
But how, when, what should I do?

5
00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:45.921
So, White Storm wants
to steal my riches.


6
00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:48.024
This looks like
a smart hiding place.


7
00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:49.158
I'm too clever.

8
00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:47.682
What do you think
Detective Riller?


9
00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:48.750
I've got it figured out.

10
00:02:49.818 --> 00:02:51.087
White Storm knocked
the security guard out cold,


11
00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.122
threatened the victim
into opening the safe,


12
00:02:53.822 --> 00:02:55.091
took the money inside,

13
00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:56.758
then killed the victim
with that wooden boat.


14
00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:00.096
You can take my for word it,

15
00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.164
mystery solved, case closed.

16
00:03:02.198 --> 00:03:03.898
Why not kill the security guard?

17
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.370
He attacked me from behind,
maybe 'cause I didn't see him?


18
00:03:09.338 --> 00:03:11.140
Brilliant deduction. Hmm?

19
00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:13.242
Reasonable enough.

20
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.776
How about
Sherlock Holmes' opinion?


21
00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:16.778
No need, I said "Case closed."

22
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.047
Not so fast.

23
00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:24.886
Although White Storm
has committed many crimes,


24
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.224
he has never hurt anyone,
don't you find this suspicious?


25
00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:30.192
There's a first time for
everything,


26
00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:30.993
desperate, perhaps?

27
00:03:31.026 --> 00:03:31.893
We don't need you here,
Sherlock.


28
00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:33.728
My genius
has solved the case already.


29
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.030
So don't meddle
with the crime scene.


30
00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:38.800
You're the one who meddles,
I scrutinize the evidence.


31
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.249
Oh.

32
00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:56.051
That really hurt.

33
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.086
Hold on now, what are
you doing with that filthy soot?


34
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.921
Stop right now.

35
00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:34.190
Sherlock, if you keep messing
with the evidence,


36
00:04:35.224 --> 00:04:36.392
even the Queen of England
can't bail you out.


37
00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:39.929
Hm.

38
00:04:41.997 --> 00:04:43.132
Huh? What's this?

39
00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:47.136
Huh?
Why is there a hole in the roof?


40
00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:49.771
You must be Gibson.

41
00:04:50.172 --> 00:04:51.073
How are you holding up?

42
00:04:52.074 --> 00:04:54.243
Uh, a little sore,
how did you know my name?


43
00:04:54.842 --> 00:04:56.245
Just a wild guess.

44
00:04:56.278 --> 00:04:58.480
Sherlock,
what is this all about, huh?


45
00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:00.916
Isn't it obvious detective,

46
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.152
the killer is still in this room
and it's him.


47
00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:07.056
Huh? Me? This must be a mistake.

48
00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.091
You have a lot to learn.

49
00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.227
The safe has indeed been opened,

50
00:05:11.493 --> 00:05:13.462
but there's no evidence
of force.


51
00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:16.932
The logical conclusion,
White Storm found the key.


52
00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:19.201
But how would he know
where to find the key?


53
00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:20.868
Before each burglary,

54
00:05:20.902 --> 00:05:23.372
White Storm always
sends a letter to his target.


55
00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:26.542
<i>Alarmed, the target would move
their precious item</i>


56
00:05:26.575 --> 00:05:28.110
<i>to a safer location.</i>

57
00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:32.248
<i>In this case,
White Storm snuck in later,</i>


58
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:34.416
<i>stole the key, opened the safe,</i>

59
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.152
<i>left his signature card,
then made his getaway.</i>


60
00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:39.188
<i>When our victim
discovered the theft,</i>


61
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:41.090
<i>he likely scolded his security.</i>

62
00:05:41.457 --> 00:05:45.793
So, out of anger he hit
the victim with the boat.


63
00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.829
That's not what happened,
let me go.


64
00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:49.265
That's not a reason
to kill someone.


65
00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:52.101
Detective Fox,
what know you of the victim?


66
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:56.105
A great deal, he was a tycoon
in the whaling industry,


67
00:05:56.138 --> 00:05:58.941
extracting whale blubber
for lamps and he made a fortune.


68
00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.977
But as London gradually
converted to electricity,


69
00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:04.779
the entire industry collapsed.
He was forced to retire.


70
00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:06.548
And that is when

71
00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:08.584
he decided
to become a loan shark,


72
00:06:08.617 --> 00:06:09.551
lending money to sailors,

73
00:06:09.585 --> 00:06:11.453
though they couldn't afford
the interest.


74
00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:14.889
That's why
his most valuable assets


75
00:06:14.923 --> 00:06:16.959
were the loan contracts
inside the safe.


76
00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:20.062
<i>Who knew that White Storm
would burn them all?</i>


77
00:06:21.263 --> 00:06:22.531
<i>Gibson was one of his borrowers</i>

78
00:06:22.564 --> 00:06:25.234
<i>and was forced to work
as security to pay the debt.</i>


79
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:28.203
<i>Enraged that all the contracts
had burned to ashes,</i>


80
00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:30.939
<i>the victim tried to force
Gibson to sign a new loan.</i>


81
00:06:31.273 --> 00:06:33.375
<i>Needless to say,
Gibson refused.</i>


82
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.377
<i>Known for his greed and temper,</i>

83
00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:38.080
<i>the victim lashed out at Gibson
with his fountain pen.</i>


84
00:06:38.113 --> 00:06:40.382
<i>That is how fibers
from Gibson's clothes</i>


85
00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:42.151
<i>got on the tip of the pen.</i>

86
00:06:45.087 --> 00:06:47.822
<i>At that moment, the maid
came to serve breakfast.</i>


87
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.959
<i>Gibson threw the new loan
contract into the fireplace.</i>


88
00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:52.561
<i>Then he pretended to pass out
on the floor.</i>


89
00:06:52.594 --> 00:06:54.862
Oh. Hold on a second.

90
00:06:55.097 --> 00:06:57.865
If the contract was burned,
how could you know this?


91
00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:01.603
Gibson hadn't noticed that
the fireplace had been put out.


92
00:07:01.637 --> 00:07:04.139
However, the residual heat
from the ashes was enough


93
00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:07.343
to singe the contract,
making it no longer legible.


94
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.113
However, when the victim
was writing the new contract,


95
00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:13.148
<i>he wrote it on top of
the evening newspaper</i>


96
00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.016
<i>on the desk.</i>

97
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.051
<i>It seems he was too angry</i>

98
00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:18.420
<i>because he pressed really hard
when he wrote his draft.</i>


99
00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:20.255
<i>The ink from the newspaper
had smeared on</i>


100
00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:21.490
<i>the back of the writing paper.</i>

101
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:24.526
<i>Since printing ink contains
flammable substances,</i>


102
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.995
<i>burnt-out rose singed
through the paper.</i>


103
00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:29.298
<i>Based on this remaining
charred fragment,</i>


104
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.167
<i>I deduced that the evidence
might be on the newspaper.</i>


105
00:07:32.668 --> 00:07:35.304
<i>So I scattered charcoal dust
onto it</i>


106
00:07:35.337 --> 00:07:37.406
and the contract was revealed.

107
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.079
He was a greedy wolf
who bullied the poor.


108
00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:44.646
I didn't mean to kill him.

109
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:47.149
Let's go, save your story
for the court.


110
00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:51.320
Hm. That was some
lucky guess, Holmes,


111
00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:53.589
but White Storm,
the thief is mine.


112
00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:55.958
Also, he might be
out of your league.


113
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:57.159
We shall see.

114
00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:06.135
Even the cleverest man
makes mistakes sometimes.


115
00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:20.082
Mr. Holmes, I guarantee you,

116
00:08:20.115 --> 00:08:22.284
this is absolutely the most
important invention


117
00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:23.318
after the steam engine.

118
00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:26.088
Pardon, the most important
what now?


119
00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:28.257
The most important invention.

120
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.259
If you don't embrace
the new era,


121
00:08:30.292 --> 00:08:32.261
the new era
will leave you behind.


122
00:08:32.294 --> 00:08:35.330
Uh, Mr. Holmes,
this is better than anything


123
00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:37.132
- I ever sold you before.
- Found it.


124
00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:38.233
this is different.

125
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:40.602
I guarantee it will
change your life forever.


126
00:08:41.036 --> 00:08:43.205
You can be the first one to...

127
00:08:43.238 --> 00:08:44.072
Please, to the point.

128
00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:47.476
Huh?

129
00:08:52.047 --> 00:08:53.949
I call it mobile phone.

130
00:08:55.317 --> 00:08:58.253
The mobile phone will change
communication forever.


131
00:08:58.287 --> 00:08:59.655
With this, you won't need to
go all the way


132
00:08:59.688 --> 00:09:01.490
to the post office
just to make a call.


133
00:09:01.523 --> 00:09:02.991
It's not working.

134
00:09:03.025 --> 00:09:04.660
Uh, the line
isn't connected yet.


135
00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:05.427
What line?

136
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.261
The telephone line.

137
00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:08.464
For you, early bird price
of 100 pounds.


138
00:09:08.497 --> 00:09:10.165
- Why not?
- Good grief.


139
00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:11.767
That is three years' rent.

140
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.302
Where will you find the money?

141
00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:16.238
Watson, we can't possibly
turn down such a marvel.


142
00:09:16.271 --> 00:09:17.506
What about our rent?

143
00:09:17.773 --> 00:09:19.675
You're a gifted doctor,
see more patients.


144
00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:20.442
Please sign here.

145
00:09:22.044 --> 00:09:23.579
If you don't embrace
the new era,


146
00:09:23.612 --> 00:09:25.180
the new era
will leave you behind.


147
00:09:25.214 --> 00:09:26.048
Well said.

148
00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:30.152
Mr. Holmes, I heard a rumor.

149
00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:31.487
- Huh? What is that?
- What have you heard?


150
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.387
- What is that?
- What have you heard?


151
00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:33.188
What is that?

152
00:09:33.989 --> 00:09:35.324
It's our new home
for three years.


153
00:09:35.357 --> 00:09:36.525
What have you heard, Bunny?

154
00:09:37.626 --> 00:09:39.461
Someone's peddling jewelry
by the slums


155
00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:41.196
near the riverside
on the East End.


156
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.131
I heard they're stolen goods.

157
00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:43.765
Shall we go look?

158
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.002
White Storm. Onwards, Watson!

159
00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:55.310
I had hoped
London entered a new era.


160
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:57.446
Where there is new,
there is old.


161
00:09:57.479 --> 00:09:59.281
People turn a blind eye
to the poor.


162
00:09:59.314 --> 00:10:02.351
But these are the people
who must not be forgotten.


163
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.786
I wish we could do more.

164
00:10:06.088 --> 00:10:07.723
Even if you were to spend
all of your money,


165
00:10:08.323 --> 00:10:10.025
it would barely feed them
for a week.


166
00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:11.793
How much can we really help?

167
00:10:11.827 --> 00:10:14.229
Your words are so cold.

168
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.099
The truth is not
always agreeable, dear Watson,


169
00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:20.269
The new era has abandoned

170
00:10:20.302 --> 00:10:22.638
not only these ships,
but people too.


171
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.308
It's mine, I nicked it.

172
00:10:27.442 --> 00:10:29.278
It's mine let go of it.

173
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.314
I told you it's mine.

174
00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:34.116
What do you mean it's yours?

175
00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:36.618
I helped nick it too,
that's not fair.


176
00:10:37.152 --> 00:10:38.086
Give it back.

177
00:10:47.663 --> 00:10:48.797
There's danger here.

178
00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:51.400
This way.

179
00:10:58.206 --> 00:11:00.509
Come on, let's go,
what are you doing?


180
00:11:01.176 --> 00:11:02.177
Thinking ahead.

181
00:11:06.114 --> 00:11:07.849
Well, well,
what do we have here, then?


182
00:11:07.883 --> 00:11:10.652
You see this lads,
Mr. Heartless,


183
00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:11.921
far from home are ya?

184
00:11:11.955 --> 00:11:14.756
I heard someone is peddling
acquired goods here.


185
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.825
I'm hoping to pick up
a cheap pocket watch for myself.


186
00:11:16.858 --> 00:11:18.160
Acquired goods?

187
00:11:18.393 --> 00:11:20.329
Why not say
what you really mean?


188
00:11:20.362 --> 00:11:21.296
You're calling us thieves, eh?

189
00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:24.800
I am sure you gentlemen
abide by British law.


190
00:11:27.903 --> 00:11:30.439
We abide by slum laws.

191
00:11:30.472 --> 00:11:34.142
Slum laws, slum laws, slum laws.

192
00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.478
Since you're all experts
in the law,


193
00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:39.214
I wonder if you've ever
heard of this proverb.


194
00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:43.151
Justice is blind.

195
00:11:46.722 --> 00:11:47.456
Find 'em

196
00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:56.164
Good grief,
I'm exhausted, Sherlock.


197
00:11:56.665 --> 00:11:57.666
Onwards, Watson!

198
00:12:01.737 --> 00:12:04.673
Perhaps a spot of tea
would energize me.


199
00:12:04.906 --> 00:12:06.174
My thoughts exactly.

200
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.648
I must say,
fancy, looks expensive.


201
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:14.549
Good thing you have
a lot of patience.


202
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.221
Mr. Holmes, these are
all of our cake varieties.


203
00:12:19.254 --> 00:12:19.956
Most kind.

204
00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.924
You certainly are amazing.

205
00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.692
While I struggle to pay
all our rent,


206
00:12:23.725 --> 00:12:26.261
you go around and
get treated like royalty.


207
00:12:28.296 --> 00:12:31.166
It turns out what Bunny heard
isn't true.


208
00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:34.369
No one would go to the slums
to sell jewelry.


209
00:12:34.736 --> 00:12:35.737
Mm.

210
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:37.339
White Storm hadn't gone there
to find a buyer.


211
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.308
He was helping the poor
with his stolen goods.


212
00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:44.646
Could he be a thief
with a heart?


213
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.882
I'm guessing that
every time he goes there,


214
00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:48.550
<i>he would bring cakes
for the children.</i>


215
00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:51.954
So cake is a clue,
why didn't you tell me earlier?


216
00:12:53.555 --> 00:12:55.357
And I thought tea was my idea,

217
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.225
but I see you were
way ahead of me.


218
00:12:57.259 --> 00:12:59.394
In all our years together,
you still amaze me.


219
00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:03.198
Why thank you, Dr. Watson!

220
00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:05.801
- Excuse me.
- Yes?


221
00:13:05.834 --> 00:13:07.769
May I ask how many cake shops
around here


222
00:13:07.803 --> 00:13:09.838
sell this same kind of
lemon cream cake?


223
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:12.574
Perhaps a few,
I assure you ours is the best.


224
00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:15.677
Any customers come here
and buy whole cakes recently?


225
00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:17.947
All the time.
What do you wish to know?


226
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.382
Any unusual customers?

227
00:13:20.816 --> 00:13:22.250
Uhh...

228
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.453
Hm. There is one.

229
00:13:24.486 --> 00:13:27.289
On occasion he would buy
all of the lemon cream cakes.


230
00:13:27.322 --> 00:13:28.890
- And this morning?
- Yes.


231
00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:30.993
If he buys them all,
then how did I get a slice?


232
00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:32.828
He came late today.

233
00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.831
Most of the lemon cakes were
sold to other customers already.


234
00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:37.365
Your slice was the last one.

235
00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.334
You're a very lucky man,
Mr. Holmes.


236
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:40.736
Indeed, I am.

237
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.638
But this man who
buys the lemon cake, tell me,


238
00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:44.706
what does he look like?

239
00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:47.609
He's slightly taller and
older than you Mr. Holmes,


240
00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:48.744
<i>and he wears glasses.</i>

241
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:51.513
He just ordered an extra-large,
five-pound cake


242
00:13:51.546 --> 00:13:53.715
to be delivered
to Santa Maria Orphanage


243
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:55.851
for a birthday party
the day after tomorrow.


244
00:13:55.884 --> 00:13:57.753
Santa Maria Orphanage?

245
00:13:59.688 --> 00:14:01.356
Dr. Watson, Dr. Watson!

246
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:03.960
I heard Mr. Holmes has ordered
a whole table full of cakes.


247
00:14:03.993 --> 00:14:05.027
Do you need my help?

248
00:14:10.732 --> 00:14:13.936
If only your
feet were as fast as your ears,


249
00:14:14.369 --> 00:14:16.371
you could have saved me
from overindulging.


250
00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:19.775
The cakes were simply
too delicious.


251
00:14:21.476 --> 00:14:24.013
White Storm buys cakes
for children all the time.


252
00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:25.580
It's quite benevolent of him.

253
00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:27.682
Come now, Sherlock,

254
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.418
perhaps he just wants
the poor to protect him.


255
00:14:30.987 --> 00:14:32.554
Don't be fooled Holmes.

256
00:14:32.587 --> 00:14:33.022
Wise words, Wats...

257
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.158
Unbelievable,
you're always late with rent


258
00:14:35.191 --> 00:14:38.094
and now dodgy people are here
smashing the flat to bits.


259
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:38.995
What have you got to say?

260
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:42.064
Oh, you're back.
The telephone line is connected.


261
00:14:42.098 --> 00:14:43.598
- Calls can be made now.
- Splendid.


262
00:14:44.866 --> 00:14:46.368
Huh? What is it?

263
00:14:46.401 --> 00:14:48.637
A telephone, my own telephone.

264
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.472
I can make calls at home,
isn't it amazing?


265
00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:52.641
- Amazing.
- Isn't it expensive?


266
00:14:52.674 --> 00:14:55.044
Oh, Alice, if you don't
embrace the new era,


267
00:14:55.077 --> 00:14:57.046
the new era
will leave you behind.


268
00:14:57.079 --> 00:14:58.647
The future is worth
investing in.


269
00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.548
At what cost?

270
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:01.850
My aunt will want to know
why you're late with the rent.


271
00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:04.053
Oh! This is outrageous.

272
00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:11.060
Ah-ha, now who shall I call?

273
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.995
Call me, go on, call me.

274
00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:15.697
You're standing right here,
call you?


275
00:15:16.032 --> 00:15:17.365
<i>Good morning, number please.</i>

276
00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:19.701
Oh. Please connect me
to the Queen.


277
00:15:20.535 --> 00:15:21.436
The Queen?

278
00:15:21.736 --> 00:15:23.805
Young man, don't make pranks.

279
00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.740
There are seven other people
trying to make calls.


280
00:15:25.774 --> 00:15:27.143
Let me! Let me!

281
00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.011
Connect me
to the Queen of England.


282
00:15:31.047 --> 00:15:33.015
And what did the Queen of
England say to you?


283
00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:37.086
That I'm a royal pain
in the rear.


284
00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:39.554
What's so funny?

285
00:15:39.588 --> 00:15:41.057
The Queen of England,

286
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.824
I just spoke to her
on the telephone.


287
00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:44.126
Isn't that amazing?

288
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.560
I think it's really amazing.

289
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.035
Ah. The mark of White Storm.

290
00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:56.105
I must reciprocate the courtesy.

291
00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:25.734
Story time, story time,
story time!


292
00:16:25.767 --> 00:16:27.769
For a rainy day, let me see.

293
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.804
Hm. What story should I...

294
00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:32.074
Hey, Mistress.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes is here.


295
00:16:32.108 --> 00:16:33.642
He says he needs
to ask something of you.


296
00:16:33.675 --> 00:16:36.511
Perfect timing,
I can ask something of him also.


297
00:16:36.544 --> 00:16:38.014
<i>This is beneath my brilliance.</i>

298
00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:39.848
Go for it.

299
00:16:40.782 --> 00:16:43.185
Children,
please give a round of applause


300
00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:45.054
and welcome
our storyteller today,


301
00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:48.190
the great detective,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.


302
00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:50.026
Must I really?

303
00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:51.227
Good morning.

304
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.762
Actually all of
my detective stories


305
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.598
are written by
my good friend, Dr. Watson.


306
00:16:56.966 --> 00:17:00.069
Please welcome the brilliant
storyteller, Dr. Watson.


307
00:17:03.905 --> 00:17:05.807
Don't you dare leave me alone.

308
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.575
I couldn't find
a more brilliant mind.


309
00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:12.547
You want to hear
a detective mystery? Hm?


310
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:13.848
Sure.

311
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:19.155
One day there was an amazing
trapeze acrobat artist who...


312
00:17:19.188 --> 00:17:22.158
I know, he slipped and
plunged to a tragic death.


313
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:23.458
That's so brilliant.

314
00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:24.060
I know.

315
00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:25.161
Thank you,

316
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.931
the children haven't been
this happy for a very long time.


317
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:31.499
We're having
a birthday party tomorrow.


318
00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:32.734
Why don't you come by

319
00:17:32.767 --> 00:17:34.203
and share more
of your wonderful stories?


320
00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:36.072
Sure, whose birthday is it?

321
00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:37.906
The oldest one in the back.

322
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.208
Her name is Katie.

323
00:17:39.241 --> 00:17:39.874
I see.

324
00:17:40.742 --> 00:17:42.044
Then nearby cake shop
is well known


325
00:17:42.078 --> 00:17:43.112
for their lemon cream cake.

326
00:17:43.778 --> 00:17:45.147
Why don't I buy one
for the party?


327
00:17:45.181 --> 00:17:48.150
What a coincidence,
but you really don't have to.


328
00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:49.986
That cake happens to be
Katie's favorite.


329
00:17:50.186 --> 00:17:52.620
Her benefactor
buys one for her every year.


330
00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:54.190
Well, that's nice.

331
00:17:54.223 --> 00:17:56.058
I can't believe there's such
a giving person in London,


332
00:17:56.092 --> 00:17:57.193
nowadays.

333
00:17:57.226 --> 00:17:59.061
London has many wealthy people,

334
00:17:59.261 --> 00:18:01.629
but not many
are willing to donate.


335
00:18:03.698 --> 00:18:05.700
The only reason our orphanage
has survived


336
00:18:05.734 --> 00:18:07.937
is because of
his annual donations.


337
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.106
And do you know
who this benefactor is?


338
00:18:10.139 --> 00:18:12.574
Unfortunately not,
he's very secretive.


339
00:18:12.607 --> 00:18:13.943
The end.

340
00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.212
That's the end of the story.

341
00:18:16.245 --> 00:18:16.878
Any questions?

342
00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:18.847
Yes, who ate
my muffin this morning?


343
00:18:20.915 --> 00:18:21.850
I'll let our great detective
find the culprit.


344
00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:24.719
All right then,
tell me who ate my muffin.


345
00:18:24.753 --> 00:18:25.553
You did.

346
00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:27.189
Wow, you're amazing.

347
00:18:27.223 --> 00:18:29.158
How come my poop
sometimes floats


348
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.060
and sometimes sinks
to the bottom?


349
00:18:31.093 --> 00:18:32.194
Because when you're a good boy

350
00:18:32.228 --> 00:18:33.262
and eat more vegetables,

351
00:18:34.296 --> 00:18:34.896
fiber is lighter than water,
making your poo...


352
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.133
So don't be a picky eater.

353
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:43.738
Mr. Holmes, please, is it
possible you could help Katie


354
00:18:43.772 --> 00:18:47.909
find her father
so they can reunite as a family?


355
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.579
Well, I'll try my best.

356
00:18:59.155 --> 00:19:00.588
Children, stop running.

357
00:19:00.622 --> 00:19:03.259
It was amazing to see
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.


358
00:19:03.292 --> 00:19:06.062
When I'm older, I want to be
a great detective too.


359
00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:08.197
So do I, do you think maybe

360
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.765
we should start up
our own agency someday?


361
00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:11.833
Hello.

362
00:19:11.866 --> 00:19:13.102
What is it?

363
00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:14.569
Ronald.

364
00:19:15.703 --> 00:19:16.571
Happy Birthday.

365
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.641
It must be him.

366
00:19:21.177 --> 00:19:22.344
He is just a lad.

367
00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:24.280
Maybe White Storm is a lad.

368
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:28.583
No, I doubt this lad
is Katie's father.


369
00:19:29.218 --> 00:19:31.820
How do you know White Storm
is the girl's father?


370
00:19:33.055 --> 00:19:34.123
It was tough work.

371
00:19:35.558 --> 00:19:37.892
<i>First, I had to deal with a
group of crazy little goblins.</i>


372
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.196
<i>Then the giant ogre
almost choked me to death</i>


373
00:19:40.229 --> 00:19:41.629
<i>before I got the information.</i>

374
00:19:42.864 --> 00:19:45.767
<i>Her callous grandfather
didn't know who the father was.</i>


375
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.136
<i>So he refused to take Katie in.</i>

376
00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.072
<i>She was sent to the Santa Maria
Orphanage instead,</i>


377
00:19:50.306 --> 00:19:53.142
<i>but the orphanage was
on the verge of closing down</i>


378
00:19:53.175 --> 00:19:54.909
<i>due to insufficient funding.</i>

379
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:58.347
<i>However, a few years
after Katie's arrival,</i>


380
00:19:58.981 --> 00:20:02.717
<i>a mystery man began to donate
large sums of money every year,</i>


381
00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:05.988
<i>along with
a very special birthday cake.</i>


382
00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:10.059
Still doesn't explain why
you believe he is White Storm.


383
00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:11.227
I believe it.

384
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.296
Only a monster would leave
their daughter at an orphanage.


385
00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.933
All of his targets
are either corrupt officials


386
00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.102
or those who oppose the poor
or downtrodden.


387
00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:23.072
Having his daughter with him
is too dangerous.


388
00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:25.174
Well, he shouldn't be a thief
then should he?


389
00:20:25.207 --> 00:20:27.809
Sacrificing in the name of
chivalry and justice


390
00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:29.744
is not something that
you will ever understand.


391
00:20:30.212 --> 00:20:33.115
Chivalry and justice?
All thieves must be caught,


392
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.817
and if you don't catch them,
then you're just as guilty.


393
00:20:36.252 --> 00:20:36.952
It's him.

394
00:20:40.889 --> 00:20:41.423
Okay.

395
00:20:42.525 --> 00:20:44.226
Arresting him in front of
his daughter is too cruel.


396
00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:45.727
What then?

397
00:20:46.562 --> 00:20:48.197
His carriage is parked
at the gate.


398
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.265
I don't think he'll stay
too long.


399
00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:51.900
We can box him in
from the left, right, and center


400
00:20:51.934 --> 00:20:52.601
when he leaves.

401
00:20:52.635 --> 00:20:53.801
He won't be able to get away.

402
00:20:54.403 --> 00:20:56.272
Yes,
I was going to suggest that.


403
00:20:56.738 --> 00:20:57.940
Keep an eye on the driver.

404
00:20:57.973 --> 00:21:00.109
He won't escape us.

405
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:09.251
Hello sir,
were you thinking about playing?


406
00:21:09.952 --> 00:21:11.786
You might be too big
for that swing.


407
00:21:13.122 --> 00:21:14.089
A success this time?

408
00:21:14.756 --> 00:21:15.690
Try for yourself.

409
00:21:16.724 --> 00:21:19.061
The largest piece
is made especially for you.


410
00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.198
That's much too big,

411
00:21:22.231 --> 00:21:23.898
will you share half of it
with me?


412
00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:27.436
Sure, how is it,
does it taste okay?


413
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:28.903
Mm.

414
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:30.838
Come this way.

415
00:21:31.407 --> 00:21:33.209
They just blossomed.
Aren't they beautiful?


416
00:21:34.143 --> 00:21:35.211
Very beautiful.

417
00:21:35.244 --> 00:21:36.911
Take a sniff, they smell nice.

418
00:21:40.282 --> 00:21:42.817
I'm so sorry,
I forgot about your allergy.


419
00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:44.420
Not at all, they smell lovely.

420
00:21:44.954 --> 00:21:45.621
Come this way.

421
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.792
Oh, I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine.


422
00:21:50.825 --> 00:21:52.261
Sorry, I forgot the time.

423
00:21:52.294 --> 00:21:53.429
I'll come visit again, bye-bye.

424
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.797
Sir! Sir!

425
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.439
- Huh? Where's Sherlock now?
- Huh?


426
00:22:08.277 --> 00:22:10.878
Well, we meet in person at last.

427
00:22:10.912 --> 00:22:12.147
Hello there, White Storm.

428
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:14.083
You have the wrong man.

429
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:18.387
And you have my pipe.
Hand it over, Mack.


430
00:22:20.122 --> 00:22:22.857
You are the great
detective Sherlock Holmes.


431
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.013
Give it up.

432
00:22:47.182 --> 00:22:48.250
No!

433
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.819
Are you done?

434
00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:53.788
Want to embarrass yourself
in front of your daughter?


435
00:22:54.856 --> 00:22:56.791
Gotcha!
It's just as I planned.


436
00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:58.994
You have the right
to remain silent.


437
00:22:59.028 --> 00:22:59.794
Sir.

438
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.366
Uh, Anything you say
may be used against you


439
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.234
in a court of law.

440
00:23:06.435 --> 00:23:08.404
Look at you, you should have
been a law abiding citizen.


441
00:23:09.038 --> 00:23:11.206
You are nothing
but a lowly thief.


442
00:23:13.108 --> 00:23:14.410
Since this is
your first offense,


443
00:23:14.443 --> 00:23:16.844
the judge will likely give you
a lighter sentence,


444
00:23:16.878 --> 00:23:18.314
maybe just 10 years or so.

445
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.071
What is it?

446
00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:44.206
Why does everybody seems so sad?

447
00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:46.308
See it for yourself.

448
00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:49.278
I can't read, how am I supposed
to know what it says?


449
00:23:50.446 --> 00:23:52.214
Mack,
also known as White Storm,


450
00:23:52.247 --> 00:23:53.582
came from a wealthy family.

451
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:56.118
They made their fortune
from gems and jewelry,


452
00:23:56.318 --> 00:23:59.121
but things went downhill
after he took over the business.


453
00:23:59.154 --> 00:24:01.023
He disappeared from high society

454
00:24:01.056 --> 00:24:02.591
after squandering
the family fortune.


455
00:24:02.624 --> 00:24:05.094
If I were him, I would just
kick back and enjoy life.


456
00:24:05.127 --> 00:24:07.196
Why bother to rob the rich
to help the poor?


457
00:24:07.229 --> 00:24:09.231
Now he's in prison
because of Mr. Holmes.


458
00:24:09.264 --> 00:24:10.399
Keep it down.

459
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.900
The paper calls Sherlock
heartless


460
00:24:12.935 --> 00:24:14.603
for capturing Mack
in front of his daughter.


461
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.873
Mr. Holmes, you've been
playing the violin for two days.


462
00:24:19.141 --> 00:24:20.442
Please stop blaming yourself.

463
00:24:20.642 --> 00:24:23.579
Even if your hands aren't tired,
my ears are tired.


464
00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:26.148
Let's play blind man's bluff.

465
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:29.351
Oh no, I better hide this.

466
00:24:33.255 --> 00:24:35.023
If you think
that's too childish,


467
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.291
how 'bout playing
cops and robbers?


468
00:24:36.325 --> 00:24:38.026
You'll be the cop
and I'll be the robber.


469
00:24:38.427 --> 00:24:41.263
If you catch me, it will be
your greatest victory yet.


470
00:24:41.463 --> 00:24:42.598
Let Mr. Holmes be.

471
00:24:42.631 --> 00:24:44.032
I'm just trying to cheer him up.

472
00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:46.368
Mr. Holmes,
you haven't eaten for two days.


473
00:24:48.404 --> 00:24:50.205
Let's go out and have some cake.

474
00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:53.175
I'll be kind enough
to let you pay for it. Ha.


475
00:24:53.208 --> 00:24:55.110
- Ah! Good idea.
- I'm broke.


476
00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:56.278
- My treat.
- Mm-hm.


477
00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:57.279
I'm tired.

478
00:24:57.713 --> 00:24:58.414
Don't be lazy.

479
00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:01.316
You must get out of the flat!

480
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.188
How rude!

481
00:25:06.455 --> 00:25:08.123
Tell me which newspaper
you're from.


482
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.027
Oh, sorry, I'm a reporter
for the <i>London Times.</i>


483
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.296
I'd like to have an interview
with Mr. Sherlock Holmes.


484
00:25:14.329 --> 00:25:16.432
Was "Heartless Sherlock"
your idea?


485
00:25:16.465 --> 00:25:18.367
I wish I were that creative.

486
00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:21.170
So, when would be a good time
for an exclusive interview?


487
00:25:21.203 --> 00:25:23.138
Go away, we're not interested.

488
00:25:23.172 --> 00:25:24.473
It won't take up
much of your time.


489
00:25:24.506 --> 00:25:25.974
That's Sherlock Holmes.

490
00:25:26.675 --> 00:25:29.111
I heard he purposefully
shamed the daughter.


491
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.582
Sorry, this table is reserved.

492
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:35.150
How about that table?

493
00:25:36.018 --> 00:25:38.153
Sorry, this one's reserved too!

494
00:25:38.187 --> 00:25:40.189
And this one's reserved,
all reserved,


495
00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:42.291
no available table for you.

496
00:25:42.324 --> 00:25:44.393
Great detective,
come and sit with me.


497
00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:45.961
Yippee, we have a table.

498
00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:50.632
You've removed a pest from
our city, today is my treat.


499
00:25:50.666 --> 00:25:51.200
Really?

500
00:25:51.233 --> 00:25:52.668
It's the least I can do.

501
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:54.503
You boy, tie my shoelace.

502
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.337
Yes, sir.

503
00:25:56.038 --> 00:25:57.039
Thanks to our great detective,

504
00:25:58.207 --> 00:25:59.975
the wealthy in London can
finally sleep well at night.


505
00:26:00.609 --> 00:26:02.444
You are truly unstoppable.

506
00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:04.213
Not only did you arrest the man,

507
00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:06.114
you arrested him
right in front of his daughter.


508
00:26:06.548 --> 00:26:08.283
Now that's dedication.

509
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:10.486
Here's to you.

510
00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:14.423
You ought to arrest
the daughter now.


511
00:26:22.364 --> 00:26:24.500
You stinky skunk,
why are you here?


512
00:26:24.533 --> 00:26:26.168
Katie was so happy before

513
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:27.636
but now
she's been crying for days.


514
00:26:28.303 --> 00:26:30.205
If my poop
had not sunk to the bottom,


515
00:26:30.239 --> 00:26:32.341
I would've scooped it out
and thrown it at you.


516
00:26:32.374 --> 00:26:33.442
- Get lost!
- Get lost!


517
00:27:12.247 --> 00:27:15.217
Mr. Holmes, I dare say
that inside this prison,


518
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:16.552
at least half the inmates

519
00:27:16.585 --> 00:27:18.820
have their eyes on
White Storm's stolen riches.


520
00:27:18.854 --> 00:27:20.289
Haven't you read the papers?

521
00:27:20.322 --> 00:27:22.124
He donated everything
that he's stole


522
00:27:22.157 --> 00:27:23.625
and kept nothing for himself.

523
00:27:25.827 --> 00:27:27.663
Most of the shady crooks
in this cell can't read


524
00:27:28.297 --> 00:27:30.365
and those who can
won't believe such a story.


525
00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:32.467
A noble thief is unheard of.

526
00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:34.303
Is Mack in great danger then?

527
00:27:34.336 --> 00:27:36.438
We the Royal Prison Guards
are renowned


528
00:27:36.471 --> 00:27:38.273
for our unyielding dedication.

529
00:27:38.707 --> 00:27:40.208
No need to worry at all.

530
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.144
Attention!

531
00:28:02.197 --> 00:28:03.332
This is a surprise.

532
00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:05.133
I thought I should come,

533
00:28:06.168 --> 00:28:08.170
best to apologize to you
in person.


534
00:28:08.737 --> 00:28:10.138
Apologize?

535
00:28:10.172 --> 00:28:10.839
My timing.

536
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:15.143
A failed thief was
defeated by a skilled detective.


537
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.145
No need to apologize.

538
00:28:18.213 --> 00:28:20.248
I regret taking action
on Katie's birthday.


539
00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:22.451
I should have found
a better way.


540
00:28:23.185 --> 00:28:24.886
It wasn't right
for her to see that.


541
00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:28.223
The timing was awful indeed.

542
00:28:28.523 --> 00:28:31.159
That very day,
I had planned on retiring.


543
00:28:32.894 --> 00:28:35.464
Legally speaking,
I can't condone stealing.


544
00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:37.633
The city has abandoned the poor.

545
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.402
However, I wish you could have
found a better way as well.


546
00:28:42.204 --> 00:28:43.905
I thought I was doing
the right thing


547
00:28:44.573 --> 00:28:46.141
<i>until that last time.</i>

548
00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:52.347
- White Storm, White Storm!
- White Storm!


549
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:52.748
What is it?

550
00:28:53.582 --> 00:28:55.450
Would you like some cake?

551
00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:56.485
I nicked them both.

552
00:28:56.518 --> 00:28:57.753
How amazing am I?

553
00:28:57.786 --> 00:29:01.156
I'm amazing,
look at this purse, snatched!


554
00:29:01.456 --> 00:29:02.791
But you couldn't have
snatched it


555
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:04.626
if I hadn't lent you my knife.

556
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.827
You are amazing.

557
00:29:05.861 --> 00:29:07.796
Of course I am.
And don't you forget...


558
00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:09.364
<i>That really broke my heart.</i>

559
00:29:10.298 --> 00:29:12.567
Turns out I had only helped
nourish their bodies,


560
00:29:13.235 --> 00:29:14.836
but their souls were eaten away.

561
00:29:15.804 --> 00:29:17.839
Children should not idolize
a thief.


562
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.841
Truth be told Mr. Holmes,

563
00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:22.644
I should be thanking you
for arresting me.


564
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:28.550
Instead of buying them cakes,
how about books?


565
00:29:28.583 --> 00:29:30.886
Detective story books?

566
00:29:31.653 --> 00:29:33.923
The warden said
you refuse to meet with Katie.


567
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:35.857
Katie is a good girl.

568
00:29:36.658 --> 00:29:38.260
She deserves a better father.

569
00:29:40.696 --> 00:29:42.264
She's a grown woman now.

570
00:29:42.798 --> 00:29:44.266
I'm sure she understands.

571
00:29:44.299 --> 00:29:45.968
You stayed away to protect her.

572
00:29:46.401 --> 00:29:48.804
Understanding is not forgiving.

573
00:29:49.038 --> 00:29:51.640
She wouldn't have come
if she hadn't.


574
00:29:52.574 --> 00:29:54.643
Time is up,
save it for next time.


575
00:29:55.343 --> 00:29:57.746
Respect her wishes,
allow her to forgive.


576
00:31:01.543 --> 00:31:04.579
I am unbeatable!

577
00:31:08.517 --> 00:31:09.952
She wrote you a letter again.

578
00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:10.819
Thanks.

579
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:42.084
Let the show begin.

580
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.594
What?

581
00:31:55.064 --> 00:31:57.365
There's no greater game
than football.


582
00:31:57.833 --> 00:31:58.834
Scarface is going to kill him.

583
00:31:58.867 --> 00:32:00.869
I'm afraid to even sneeze
in front of the boss


584
00:32:00.902 --> 00:32:02.537
and Mack is picking
a fight with him!


585
00:32:02.571 --> 00:32:04.372
You are a dead man!

586
00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:06.976
I'm gonna beat the daylights
out of you!


587
00:32:20.455 --> 00:32:23.025
So, this Sunday
is the Queen's birthday.


588
00:32:23.059 --> 00:32:25.094
Let's go to the Thames
and see the fireworks.


589
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:27.029
Fireworks? Boring.

590
00:32:27.063 --> 00:32:28.730
But they boom and bang
and stuff.


591
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:31.466
Just a chemical
reaction exploding in the air


592
00:32:31.499 --> 00:32:33.668
while burning up
different metal powders,


593
00:32:33.702 --> 00:32:36.905
creating a variety of colors,
nothing special about it.


594
00:32:36.939 --> 00:32:38.174
I made fireworks
when I was eight.


595
00:32:38.207 --> 00:32:39.008
You're bluffing.

596
00:32:40.209 --> 00:32:41.010
Like this.

597
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.516
Oh, this is my new dress.

598
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:51.153
You're going to pay for this!

599
00:32:51.187 --> 00:32:53.990
Hello? Please hold.
It's for you.


600
00:32:54.023 --> 00:32:55.724
I'm busy,
take a message, please.


601
00:32:55.757 --> 00:32:57.525
He is utterly busy right now.

602
00:32:57.559 --> 00:32:58.760
I can take a message for him.

603
00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:01.696
Oh, I see.

604
00:33:02.198 --> 00:33:03.665
The call is from the prison.

605
00:33:03.698 --> 00:33:05.134
Something's happened to Mack.

606
00:33:11.173 --> 00:33:13.808
Apologies for asking you
to come here


607
00:33:13.842 --> 00:33:15.144
in such unforgiving weather.

608
00:33:15.177 --> 00:33:16.478
I thought you said
your guards


609
00:33:16.511 --> 00:33:17.679
were very dedicated,

610
00:33:17.712 --> 00:33:18.613
how could this happen?

611
00:33:21.783 --> 00:33:24.786
It's a long story,
one you can't imagine.


612
00:33:29.258 --> 00:33:32.194
I'm gonna beat the daylights
out of you!


613
00:33:32.228 --> 00:33:33.895
Huh?

614
00:33:50.745 --> 00:33:52.747
You broke my tooth!

615
00:33:57.852 --> 00:33:59.121
Hey you, stop!

616
00:34:03.025 --> 00:34:05.727
Get on your knees,
hands behind your head.


617
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.228
Kneel down.

618
00:34:07.196 --> 00:34:08.998
How dare you pick on
someone twice your size?


619
00:34:09.031 --> 00:34:10.232
That's solitary confinement.

620
00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:15.870
I don't understand.

621
00:34:15.904 --> 00:34:18.907
He was a model inmate,
due for release in a year.


622
00:34:19.108 --> 00:34:21.010
So why the serious assault?

623
00:34:21.043 --> 00:34:22.011
Why break out?

624
00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:24.113
I thought he was
smarter than that.


625
00:34:25.047 --> 00:34:27.049
Perhaps he had his reasons.

626
00:34:27.615 --> 00:34:30.152
Indeed, it seems
Mack started a fight


627
00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:32.520
to get sent to solitary
for his jailbreak.


628
00:34:34.689 --> 00:34:36.058
That much I guessed.

629
00:34:36.725 --> 00:34:39.728
What's strange is why Scarface?

630
00:34:39.761 --> 00:34:42.864
Why risk his life with
the most vicious prisoner here?


631
00:34:45.567 --> 00:34:47.902
Did anything unusual
happen before his escape?


632
00:34:47.937 --> 00:34:48.938
Was he upset about anything?

633
00:34:48.971 --> 00:34:52.174
No, he just read a letter
from his daughter.


634
00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:54.276
A letter, do you know
what it was about?


635
00:34:54.709 --> 00:34:55.978
No, I didn't look.

636
00:34:56.911 --> 00:34:59.215
As you can see,
the door is still locked.


637
00:34:59.248 --> 00:35:00.882
The bars are still intact.

638
00:35:00.915 --> 00:35:02.051
That is strange.

639
00:35:02.084 --> 00:35:04.253
Oh, Detective Riller
and Detective Fox.


640
00:35:04.286 --> 00:35:07.123
Doctor Watson,
slow to the case I see.


641
00:35:07.655 --> 00:35:10.759
If you and Sherlock would like
to assist me, that's fine.


642
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.294
Have you discovered anything?

643
00:35:12.328 --> 00:35:14.596
According to
the circumstantial evidence,


644
00:35:14.629 --> 00:35:16.065
there was only one possibility.

645
00:35:16.098 --> 00:35:19.035
The way I figure it,
Mack used his stolen wealth


646
00:35:19.068 --> 00:35:20.302
<i>to buy off a prison guard,</i>

647
00:35:20.336 --> 00:35:23.538
<i>and then that guard let him out
in the middle of the night,</i>


648
00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:26.342
All signs point to
an inside job.


649
00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:28.244
Are you saying it's me?

650
00:35:28.277 --> 00:35:29.577
You admit it!

651
00:35:29.611 --> 00:35:31.213
How could I do such a thing?

652
00:35:31.247 --> 00:35:33.748
Please Mr. Holmes,
help, won't you please?


653
00:35:36.218 --> 00:35:37.253
Mack escaped from here.

654
00:35:37.286 --> 00:35:37.987
Really?

655
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.922
It's not like he's a cockroach.

656
00:35:39.955 --> 00:35:40.923
How could he squeeze through?

657
00:35:40.956 --> 00:35:42.158
It would be impossible for you,

658
00:35:44.193 --> 00:35:45.894
...but it wouldn't be
a problem for Mack.


659
00:35:46.095 --> 00:35:47.629
When did you get so strong?

660
00:35:48.197 --> 00:35:50.166
Was Mack assigned to work
in the kitchen


661
00:35:50.199 --> 00:35:52.201
and did he have frequent access
to this place?


662
00:35:53.135 --> 00:35:55.371
His duties were helping out
in the kitchen every day


663
00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:57.173
and cleaning this cell
every Friday.


664
00:35:58.407 --> 00:36:00.642
And each Friday
he tampered with the bar.


665
00:36:01.043 --> 00:36:03.345
If you look closely,
the bar has rust on it,


666
00:36:03.912 --> 00:36:06.082
evidently from the exposure
to saltwater.


667
00:36:06.115 --> 00:36:06.949
Hm.

668
00:36:08.184 --> 00:36:09.185
It does taste salty.

669
00:36:10.319 --> 00:36:11.921
Salt is usually
only found in the kitchen.


670
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:12.720
Hm.

671
00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:16.092
Can you smell salt?
Why did you sniff the bar?


672
00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:18.194
I was trying to smell
for bodily fluids.


673
00:36:19.929 --> 00:36:22.630
I'm talking about saliva,
Detective Riller.


674
00:36:22.664 --> 00:36:23.232
You scared me.

675
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.069
So Mack was stealing salt
from the kitchen for four years,


676
00:36:27.103 --> 00:36:29.071
used his saliva to dissolve
the salt,


677
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:31.739
and slathered it
onto the iron bars.


678
00:36:32.108 --> 00:36:34.143
Wow, such determination.

679
00:36:34.676 --> 00:36:35.844
Are you not ashamed?

680
00:36:35.877 --> 00:36:37.413
If it weren't for
your sloppy supervision,


681
00:36:37.446 --> 00:36:40.149
how could he have stolen salt
and spat saliva? Four years?


682
00:36:40.182 --> 00:36:41.250
Are you blind?

683
00:36:41.283 --> 00:36:42.151
What do you mean?

684
00:36:43.219 --> 00:36:44.253
How was I supposed to know
when he was spitting?


685
00:36:44.286 --> 00:36:48.690
Warden, can you show us
around the perimeter wall?


686
00:36:48.723 --> 00:36:50.993
This way please.

687
00:37:01.137 --> 00:37:04.106
Uh, boss,
you really gotta wake up.


688
00:37:04.306 --> 00:37:07.209
Something has happened,
boss, wake up!


689
00:37:07.243 --> 00:37:09.178
Hey boss, you got to wake up.

690
00:37:09.844 --> 00:37:11.046
What if I pop that thing?

691
00:37:20.956 --> 00:37:21.991
Who sneezed?

692
00:37:22.224 --> 00:37:22.992
You did.

693
00:37:26.228 --> 00:37:27.163
Right, why are you here?

694
00:37:27.196 --> 00:37:28.097
Why am I here?

695
00:37:29.198 --> 00:37:30.798
Don't you remember?
Mack whacked you on the head.


696
00:37:32.168 --> 00:37:33.768
Oh, yes.

697
00:37:35.304 --> 00:37:37.206
You were saying
something has happened.


698
00:37:38.007 --> 00:37:39.241
Mack has busted out of jail.

699
00:37:40.242 --> 00:37:42.077
What, how did he escape?

700
00:37:42.111 --> 00:37:43.345
I heard he sawed off
the iron bars


701
00:37:43.379 --> 00:37:45.981
of the solitary cell window
and then climbed over the wall.


702
00:37:47.116 --> 00:37:49.251
The window bars were sawed off?

703
00:37:49.285 --> 00:37:50.085
Yes.

704
00:37:51.253 --> 00:37:55.257
Oh no, I was the one who
told him to saw the window bars


705
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:58.093
for me to break out of here,
and I'm mad as hell right now.


706
00:37:58.127 --> 00:38:00.129
I'll still escape and
make him pay.


707
00:38:00.162 --> 00:38:01.230
But where did he go?

708
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:05.167
I know, he dropped this letter
when you were fighting.


709
00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:15.277
Oh, if only I could read.

710
00:38:18.447 --> 00:38:19.814
Ah, you're awake at last.

711
00:38:19.847 --> 00:38:21.050
Is there any pain?

712
00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:22.117
It hurts so much.

713
00:38:23.252 --> 00:38:25.120
I wanna thorough checkup
at the hospital down the hill.


714
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:27.456
That won't be necessary,
I'll take care of it.


715
00:38:28.457 --> 00:38:31.260
Doctor, I think you
really should consider


716
00:38:31.293 --> 00:38:33.229
sending me to that hospital!

717
00:38:44.406 --> 00:38:46.976
You see those six rags
here on the ground?


718
00:38:47.476 --> 00:38:50.446
They were all torn
from a jail cell quilt cover.


719
00:38:51.113 --> 00:38:53.949
Six rags,
did he have a bad cold?


720
00:38:54.583 --> 00:38:55.985
What's the use of these?

721
00:38:57.219 --> 00:39:01.090
This is just a smoke screen
to confuse our investigation.


722
00:39:01.123 --> 00:39:03.492
After all,
this prison has a rat.


723
00:39:04.026 --> 00:39:04.994
Help me.

724
00:39:06.295 --> 00:39:08.763
Warden, I just discovered this
rag outside the perimeter wall,


725
00:39:09.031 --> 00:39:10.966
it appeared today
after the snow melted.


726
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.503
Hm. It's torn from
the same quilt cover.


727
00:39:15.204 --> 00:39:17.406
Why has this piece
fallen outside the wall?


728
00:39:20.175 --> 00:39:23.012
Was this water tab kept on
throughout the night?


729
00:39:23.245 --> 00:39:25.114
It's been raining
and snowing heavily.


730
00:39:25.147 --> 00:39:27.116
If the tap isn't kept on
to drip,


731
00:39:27.149 --> 00:39:28.984
it would freeze up
and block the pipes.


732
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.988
Did it snow
the night before last?


733
00:39:33.022 --> 00:39:33.888
What was the temperature?

734
00:39:34.923 --> 00:39:37.993
It was snowing and
just below 10 degrees,


735
00:39:38.027 --> 00:39:40.229
then a few degrees warmer
when the sun came out.


736
00:39:40.262 --> 00:39:41.829
It rained
the day before yesterday


737
00:39:41.863 --> 00:39:43.831
and the temperature dropped
dramatically.


738
00:39:43.865 --> 00:39:45.968
A layer of ice must've formed
on the surface of the wall.


739
00:39:46.235 --> 00:39:47.202
<i>Thanks to this weather,</i>

740
00:39:48.237 --> 00:39:48.971
<i>Mack was able to create
a staircase</i>


741
00:39:49.605 --> 00:39:50.872
and climbed over the wall.

742
00:39:52.308 --> 00:39:53.409
I don't follow.

743
00:39:53.442 --> 00:39:54.842
The evidence is irrefutable.

744
00:39:55.177 --> 00:39:56.478
- Tell them, Watson.
- Me?


745
00:39:57.579 --> 00:39:58.314
Uh, uh.

746
00:39:59.281 --> 00:40:02.184
All signs point to a rat
amongst the guards.


747
00:40:02.217 --> 00:40:02.850
Yeah.

748
00:40:03.752 --> 00:40:05.454
Please let me go!
Help me, Mr. Holmes!


749
00:40:05.487 --> 00:40:08.057
Very well, here's my deduction.

750
00:40:08.624 --> 00:40:11.393
<i>Mack first drenched two rags
with the dripping water.</i>


751
00:40:12.027 --> 00:40:14.096
<i>He then shaped them
into fist-sized bundles</i>


752
00:40:14.129 --> 00:40:15.264
<i>and stuck them onto the wall.</i>

753
00:40:16.098 --> 00:40:17.232
<i>With the temperature so low,</i>

754
00:40:17.266 --> 00:40:19.368
<i>the water molecules
of the two rag bundles</i>


755
00:40:19.401 --> 00:40:22.304
<i>joined together with the water
molecules on the frozen wall,</i>


756
00:40:23.038 --> 00:40:25.107
<i>resulting in the bundle
sticking onto it.</i>


757
00:40:25.574 --> 00:40:27.943
<i>Mack could then use them
as stepping stones.</i>


758
00:40:27.976 --> 00:40:30.279
<i>He stuck two more bundles
on higher spots,</i>


759
00:40:30.312 --> 00:40:32.481
<i>repeating until all six
were stuck on the wall,</i>


760
00:40:32.948 --> 00:40:34.083
<i>allowing him to escape.</i>

761
00:40:34.116 --> 00:40:36.285
<i>When the sun came out
and melted the ice,</i>


762
00:40:36.318 --> 00:40:38.253
<i>all six bundles
fell to the ground,</i>


763
00:40:39.188 --> 00:40:41.423
but I have yet to figure out
the use of the rag


764
00:40:41.457 --> 00:40:42.857
found outside the wall.

765
00:40:44.993 --> 00:40:47.196
Come on, chop, chop,
whip up a plan.


766
00:40:47.996 --> 00:40:48.497
Hey!

767
00:40:49.698 --> 00:40:51.600
What are the possible escape
routes beyond the wall, huh?


768
00:40:53.235 --> 00:40:54.503
You've asked the right man.

769
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.439
Only one road leads to
Barnard Castle Station.


770
00:40:58.307 --> 00:40:59.341
Not necessarily.

771
00:41:00.242 --> 00:41:02.177
Mack probably spent hours
last night


772
00:41:02.211 --> 00:41:03.612
waiting for the rag bundles
to freeze.


773
00:41:04.046 --> 00:41:06.148
It was almost dawn
when he made it over the wall.


774
00:41:06.515 --> 00:41:09.017
He would be easily spotted
if he took the main road,


775
00:41:10.152 --> 00:41:12.488
I think he must've taken
an alternative route.


776
00:41:13.322 --> 00:41:15.157
If he had opted for
a different route,


777
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.026
he'd have to climb the mountain
and ski downhill.


778
00:41:18.327 --> 00:41:21.397
Lanky, how much time
would this route take?


779
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.999
Sir, walking would require
two days,


780
00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:26.201
but if we ride horses
up the mountain,


781
00:41:26.235 --> 00:41:28.337
then ski downhill,
it would take half a day.


782
00:41:29.138 --> 00:41:31.240
This means Mack might've
only gone down halfway.


783
00:41:31.273 --> 00:41:32.341
We might still catch him.

784
00:41:33.275 --> 00:41:35.310
Good, that thief is mine.

785
00:41:35.344 --> 00:41:36.512
Can you gentlemen handle it?

786
00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:39.515
Uphill requires horseback
and downhill requires skiing.


787
00:41:40.649 --> 00:41:41.417
Of course.

788
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.318
I don't know
how to ski actually.


789
00:41:44.119 --> 00:41:45.654
I don't know either, actually.

790
00:41:46.155 --> 00:41:48.157
I've told you to do
more exercises,


791
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.992
but you sleep on your days off.

792
00:41:51.193 --> 00:41:55.097
But work is just so tiring
and bed is so comfy.


793
00:41:55.764 --> 00:41:58.000
And what could be better
than sleeping like a log


794
00:41:58.033 --> 00:41:59.668
on a day off?

795
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.406
Warden, doctor says
Scarface is critical


796
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.008
and must be sent
to the hospital.


797
00:42:06.208 --> 00:42:07.376
Understood, good timing.

798
00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.545
Why don't you two
ride along then?


799
00:42:10.179 --> 00:42:12.147
Dr. Watson can tend to Scarface

800
00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:14.616
and Detective Fox can be there
to keep an eye on him.


801
00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:17.085
- How 'bout it?
- Sounds like a plan.


802
00:42:22.624 --> 00:42:24.359
You guys will
probably get ahead of Mack.


803
00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:27.129
Remember to contact
the Barnard Castle Police


804
00:42:27.162 --> 00:42:28.330
and ask them to join
the pursuit.


805
00:42:28.664 --> 00:42:29.264
Got it.

806
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.136
Thank you and
good luck to you all.


807
00:42:35.204 --> 00:42:36.171
Be careful.

808
00:42:36.438 --> 00:42:37.573
You too, Watson.

809
00:42:37.606 --> 00:42:40.209
Mr. Holmes, we're ready to go.

810
00:42:50.185 --> 00:42:51.320
Can we go faster?

811
00:42:51.353 --> 00:42:52.321
My rump is freezing.

812
00:42:53.322 --> 00:42:55.324
The horses are doing their best
in the snow.


813
00:42:55.357 --> 00:42:58.293
You can walk if you still think
your horse is too slow.


814
00:42:58.327 --> 00:43:00.362
Useless creature,
even a tortoise is faster.


815
00:43:23.452 --> 00:43:24.119
We're close.

816
00:43:25.087 --> 00:43:27.222
Once we're behind the trees,
we can ski down.


817
00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:31.793
Come on tortoise,
just a few more steps.


818
00:43:39.368 --> 00:43:41.036
This is the easy part.

819
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.337
Let's go.

820
00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:49.177
Are you afraid?

821
00:43:49.211 --> 00:43:50.579
Of course. Afraid?

822
00:43:50.612 --> 00:43:53.215
Afraid I might be too quick
and leave you behind.


823
00:43:53.515 --> 00:43:56.385
Since you're that quick,
I'd better get a head start.


824
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.579
Why are you poking me?

825
00:44:23.612 --> 00:44:24.246
Are we there?

826
00:44:26.214 --> 00:44:27.316
Pretend I'm not here.

827
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:31.186
We'll part ways at the hospital,
peacefully or in pieces.


828
00:44:34.356 --> 00:44:35.791
Let go of him.

829
00:44:56.345 --> 00:44:59.147
What's that noise?

830
00:44:59.181 --> 00:45:00.215
Hm.

831
00:45:07.889 --> 00:45:10.125
My trousers,
stop pulling!


832
00:45:13.963 --> 00:45:15.764
You are a dead man.

833
00:45:26.908 --> 00:45:27.576
Hoo...

834
00:45:31.213 --> 00:45:34.416
Good grief,
I should've gone skiing instead.


835
00:45:36.251 --> 00:45:37.586
Something's there.

836
00:45:40.389 --> 00:45:41.256
Huh?

837
00:45:42.125 --> 00:45:42.791
What is it?

838
00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:44.493
Sca... Scarface!

839
00:45:44.526 --> 00:45:47.362
You'll not escape!

840
00:45:49.731 --> 00:45:50.866
Where are you headin'
in such a hurry?


841
00:46:07.916 --> 00:46:08.917
Stop right there!

842
00:46:10.019 --> 00:46:12.421
What good is shouting at him?
We need to give chase.


843
00:46:12.989 --> 00:46:15.657
As a police officer,
I have to shout out a warning.


844
00:46:16.658 --> 00:46:18.794
Instead of one escapee
we have two.


845
00:46:18.827 --> 00:46:20.729
We must inform
the local police quickly,


846
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:22.965
and block off old roads
out of Barnard Castle.


847
00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:26.234
Quickly?
How do we get down there?


848
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:33.943
As long as one
is not afraid of failure,


849
00:46:33.976 --> 00:46:36.311
skiing downhill
is not difficult at all.


850
00:46:37.579 --> 00:46:38.948
But wait, how do I stop?

851
00:46:42.384 --> 00:46:44.252
Huh? What is that?

852
00:46:48.323 --> 00:46:49.992
It looks like a quilt
from the prison,


853
00:46:50.726 --> 00:46:51.994
but why is it tied like that?

854
00:46:53.029 --> 00:46:54.830
Of course, it's a sled.

855
00:46:57.365 --> 00:46:58.700
<i>If Mack had sledded down,</i>

856
00:46:58.734 --> 00:47:01.003
<i>he might've reached Barnard
Castle Station last night,</i>


857
00:47:01.436 --> 00:47:03.405
perhaps escaped
on a train already.


858
00:47:04.339 --> 00:47:06.976
Maybe, but he couldn't have
just worn his prison garb


859
00:47:07.009 --> 00:47:08.978
and hopped onto a train
in plain sight.


860
00:47:09.011 --> 00:47:11.813
Let's wait for Detective Riller
and go down together.


861
00:47:11.847 --> 00:47:14.750
You stupid tree,
step aside now!


862
00:47:15.584 --> 00:47:17.552
Shall we head to
the local police station?


863
00:47:21.023 --> 00:47:23.692
They might have some information
that can help


864
00:47:24.593 --> 00:47:27.496
or perhaps we should
go to the hospital first.


865
00:47:35.337 --> 00:47:37.606
<i>We read the case reports
at the police station.</i>


866
00:47:38.007 --> 00:47:40.042
It seems Mack reached
the foot of the mountain.


867
00:47:40.076 --> 00:47:43.012
He broke into a store and
stole a change of clothes,


868
00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:46.281
<i>then pick-pocketed someone's
wallet at the train station.</i>


869
00:47:46.848 --> 00:47:49.718
It's likely that he boarded
the last train to London.


870
00:47:51.353 --> 00:47:52.420
What about Scarface?

871
00:47:53.555 --> 00:47:55.524
We searched the entire station
and couldn't find him.


872
00:47:55.557 --> 00:47:58.493
Who would have thought this guy
was a master of disguise?


873
00:48:00.362 --> 00:48:02.364
I've been running around
and haven't eaten a thing.


874
00:48:02.397 --> 00:48:03.065
Let's have dinner.

875
00:48:03.966 --> 00:48:06.068
Dinner?!
We have a mission on our hands.


876
00:48:06.102 --> 00:48:07.469
You're a police officer.

877
00:48:07.502 --> 00:48:10.039
So act like one,
focus on the case.


878
00:48:10.605 --> 00:48:11.606
A case of food?

879
00:48:12.108 --> 00:48:13.742
Uh...

880
00:48:15.877 --> 00:48:16.711
Dinner time.

881
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:22.317
You're staring.

882
00:48:23.485 --> 00:48:25.620
I have a feeling there is
something you're not telling me.


883
00:48:26.388 --> 00:48:27.689
I know you too well.

884
00:48:27.722 --> 00:48:29.025
You're holding back secrets.

885
00:48:29.058 --> 00:48:30.725
You wait until
the moment is just right


886
00:48:30.759 --> 00:48:32.727
before the big reveal,
so what is it?


887
00:48:35.164 --> 00:48:37.699
Actually, when I heard
Mack had escaped,


888
00:48:37.732 --> 00:48:39.568
<i>I knew it had something
to do with Katie.</i>


889
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:42.404
<i>I hadn't told you that
she's getting married tomorrow.</i>


890
00:48:43.005 --> 00:48:45.007
<i>After the wedding,
they plan to leave England.</i>


891
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:46.008
<i>Huh?</i>

892
00:48:47.043 --> 00:48:49.011
So Mack broke out of jail
to attend her wedding.


893
00:48:49.045 --> 00:48:50.912
If Riller and Fox
were to discover this,


894
00:48:51.446 --> 00:48:53.115
they would wreak havoc
at the wedding.


895
00:48:53.149 --> 00:48:54.416
This I am certain.

896
00:48:55.417 --> 00:48:56.885
Riller was watching us
so I went to the prison,


897
00:48:56.919 --> 00:48:58.020
hoping they would follow.

898
00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.056
Misleading a detective

899
00:49:00.089 --> 00:49:02.457
and then assisting
a known fugitive.


900
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:04.093
These are felonies.

901
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.461
Oh, I see.

902
00:49:07.696 --> 00:49:08.965
This is my burden.

903
00:49:09.664 --> 00:49:12.001
So I feel I owe it
to Mack and his daughter.


904
00:49:34.056 --> 00:49:35.891
<i>My dearly beloved father,</i>

905
00:49:37.525 --> 00:49:39.161
<i>four years have gone by
already.</i>


906
00:49:39.694 --> 00:49:41.863
<i>Father, do you still remember
the last time</i>


907
00:49:41.897 --> 00:49:43.099
<i>we met was on my birthday?</i>

908
00:49:44.133 --> 00:49:44.866
<i>Days before,</i>

909
00:49:45.667 --> 00:49:46.835
<i>I fretted over all the things</i>

910
00:49:46.868 --> 00:49:48.104
<i>that I wanted to share with you.</i>

911
00:49:49.372 --> 00:49:51.007
<i>I wanted to show you
the flowers that I'd planted</i>


912
00:49:52.275 --> 00:49:53.775
<i>and let you taste
the cookies that I had baked,</i>


913
00:49:55.077 --> 00:49:58.080
<i>and introduce you to the man
I now call my fiancĂ©.</i>


914
00:49:59.048 --> 00:50:01.984
<i>I cannot lie, for the longest
time I was jealous</i>


915
00:50:02.018 --> 00:50:04.186
<i>that you devoted your life
to the concerns</i>


916
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.123
<i>and well-being of the poor,
when all I wanted was a father.</i>


917
00:50:08.723 --> 00:50:09.824
<i>It is not for me to judge</i>

918
00:50:09.858 --> 00:50:11.928
<i>whether your actions
were right or wrong,</i>


919
00:50:12.929 --> 00:50:15.697
<i>but even if the whole world
thinks you're a bad man,</i>


920
00:50:16.098 --> 00:50:18.034
<i>you will always be my hero.</i>

921
00:50:18.234 --> 00:50:22.104
<i>And my dearest father,
if there were ever a chance,</i>


922
00:50:22.704 --> 00:50:24.673
<i>I hope one day
to hear everything about</i>


923
00:50:24.706 --> 00:50:27.575
<i>who you really are,
father to daughter.</i>


924
00:50:28.277 --> 00:50:29.444
<i>Will you tell me?</i>

925
00:50:33.182 --> 00:50:35.017
<i>I may not have the necessary
wisdom</i>


926
00:50:35.051 --> 00:50:36.851
<i>to help you tackle
big problems,</i>


927
00:50:37.253 --> 00:50:38.853
<i>but at least for that moment,</i>

928
00:50:38.887 --> 00:50:42.024
<i>I can be there for you
and share your burdens.</i>


929
00:50:42.757 --> 00:50:45.928
<i>This Sunday, I'm getting
married at St. Martin's Church.</i>


930
00:50:47.196 --> 00:50:49.631
<i>Although you won't be there
to walk me down the aisle,</i>


931
00:50:50.066 --> 00:50:52.168
<i>I know you are with me
no matter where you are.</i>


932
00:50:54.869 --> 00:50:58.040
<i>My husband and I will journey
to universities in the Far East</i>


933
00:50:58.606 --> 00:51:01.143
<i>and pass on the knowledge
of science to the local people.</i>


934
00:51:02.111 --> 00:51:04.046
<i>Perhaps,
this is an alternative way</i>


935
00:51:04.579 --> 00:51:06.881
<i>to carry on your ambition
and legacy.</i>


936
00:51:08.217 --> 00:51:10.518
<i>Your loving daughter, Katie.</i>

937
00:51:18.593 --> 00:51:19.228
I do.

938
00:51:21.563 --> 00:51:25.234
I know pronounce you
husband and wife.


939
00:52:00.169 --> 00:52:02.804
You do know you've risked it all
with your jailbreak.


940
00:52:03.239 --> 00:52:04.606
So, was it worth it?

941
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:06.042
Greatly.

942
00:52:08.144 --> 00:52:10.879
I knew that I wouldn't be able
to walk her down the aisle,


943
00:52:11.981 --> 00:52:14.116
but at least I had the chance
to witness her wedding.


944
00:52:15.184 --> 00:52:17.987
Don't worry, I'll give myself in
once they're gone.


945
00:52:18.354 --> 00:52:20.956
I won't allow her
to have a fugitive for a father.


946
00:52:21.756 --> 00:52:23.125
If this was how you felt,

947
00:52:23.159 --> 00:52:25.094
then how is it you didn't quit
for her sake?


948
00:52:25.127 --> 00:52:28.897
Because I was very naive
when I went to jail.


949
00:52:28.931 --> 00:52:30.732
I thought
I could change the world...


950
00:52:32.968 --> 00:52:35.971
but I didn't realize that
I first had to change myself.


951
00:52:43.212 --> 00:52:45.081
Let's switch to a lighter topic.

952
00:52:45.814 --> 00:52:47.816
I commend the frozen staircase,

953
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:50.352
but what about the piece of
rag found outside the wall?


954
00:52:52.587 --> 00:52:53.956
The frozen staircase wasn't
strong enough


955
00:52:53.989 --> 00:52:54.856
to support my weight,

956
00:52:54.889 --> 00:52:56.591
fell apart
as soon as I stepped on it,


957
00:52:57.792 --> 00:52:58.793
<i>I quickly had to come up with
another plan.</i>


958
00:53:00.262 --> 00:53:01.896
<i>I tore the quilt into strips,
then tied them to make a rope.</i>


959
00:53:02.131 --> 00:53:03.199
<i>I needed warm water,</i>

960
00:53:04.632 --> 00:53:05.834
<i>so I,</i>
<i>used bodily fluid on the rope</i>


961
00:53:07.136 --> 00:53:07.970
<i>and threw the heated and
soaked end over the wall.</i>


962
00:53:09.305 --> 00:53:10.372
<i>My fluid's temperature
was nearly as warm as my body,</i>


963
00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.209
<i>approximately

964
00:53:13.943 --> 00:53:15.244
<i>When the warm,
soaked end of the rope</i>


965
00:53:15.277 --> 00:53:16.378
<i>touched the frozen wall,</i>

966
00:53:17.612 --> 00:53:20.116
<i>the warm fluid molecules
melted the icy water molecules.</i>


967
00:53:20.449 --> 00:53:23.252
<i>The melted moisture froze
due to the cold temperature,</i>


968
00:53:23.285 --> 00:53:25.087
<i>forming a strong adhesion.</i>

969
00:53:25.121 --> 00:53:27.089
<i>However,
when I was climbing the wall,</i>


970
00:53:27.423 --> 00:53:29.657
<i>I realized the rope could not
hold up for too long.</i>


971
00:53:30.159 --> 00:53:32.660
<i>Sure enough, it tore
when I was halfway down.</i>


972
00:53:33.129 --> 00:53:35.264
<i>Luckily my landing
was softened by the snow.</i>


973
00:53:35.965 --> 00:53:38.434
When the sun came out and
melted away the ice on the wall,


974
00:53:38.467 --> 00:53:41.003
the broken piece of rag
fell outside the perimeter.


975
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:42.238
I see.

976
00:53:43.239 --> 00:53:44.306
Ah, the wagon's here.

977
00:53:48.177 --> 00:53:49.245
But you couldn't have predicted

978
00:53:49.278 --> 00:53:50.912
when Katie would get married.

979
00:53:50.946 --> 00:53:53.082
Yet you spent years
breaking the iron bar.


980
00:53:54.083 --> 00:53:55.084
An opportunity.

981
00:53:56.185 --> 00:53:57.019
One of the prisoners noticed
that I'd been assigned


982
00:53:57.052 --> 00:53:59.388
to clean
the solitary confinement cell.


983
00:54:00.089 --> 00:54:03.159
So really, I was forced
to break the bar for his escape.


984
00:54:04.759 --> 00:54:06.228
Are you talking about Scarface?

985
00:54:06.262 --> 00:54:07.795
He escaped from the prison
yesterday.


986
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:08.897
What?

987
00:54:09.431 --> 00:54:13.102
Don't worry, I doubt
he would know to find you here.


988
00:54:38.327 --> 00:54:39.161
Honey?

989
00:54:55.277 --> 00:54:56.445
Mack!

990
00:54:57.513 --> 00:55:00.049
You wretched back-stabber,
you can't hide from me.


991
00:55:00.082 --> 00:55:01.283
You want your daughter back?

992
00:55:01.783 --> 00:55:03.953
Show yourself at once!

993
00:55:03.986 --> 00:55:04.420
Shh.

994
00:55:06.788 --> 00:55:07.289
Jump down.

995
00:55:08.123 --> 00:55:10.426
Trying to flee?
Over my dead body.


996
00:55:12.127 --> 00:55:14.096
Ronald!

997
00:55:16.031 --> 00:55:18.100
- Katie!
- Show yourself now!


998
00:55:18.133 --> 00:55:19.834
Give us back Katie!

999
00:55:22.438 --> 00:55:25.441
Scarface, release my daughter,
it's me you want.


1000
00:55:26.175 --> 00:55:27.009
Father!

1001
00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:32.348
I've come to realize
the more agitated you are,


1002
00:55:32.381 --> 00:55:34.183
the more exhilarated I get.

1003
00:55:39.121 --> 00:55:40.055
Stop the car!

1004
00:55:40.089 --> 00:55:40.923
Stop the car!

1005
00:56:05.847 --> 00:56:07.149
How dare you?

1006
00:56:10.386 --> 00:56:11.153
Katie!

1007
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:14.490
Father!

1008
00:56:15.557 --> 00:56:16.558
I must borrow this.

1009
00:56:16.592 --> 00:56:18.294
Sherlock Holmes took my bicycle.

1010
00:56:20.496 --> 00:56:23.265
Sir, do your civic duty
and loan me your car.


1011
00:56:23.299 --> 00:56:25.167
- Hm?
- Please, take this payment.


1012
00:56:27.403 --> 00:56:28.470
Watch out.

1013
00:56:35.477 --> 00:56:36.312
Get in.

1014
00:57:14.249 --> 00:57:15.217
Katie!

1015
00:57:56.225 --> 00:57:57.626
I can make it, I can make it,
I can make it.


1016
00:57:57.659 --> 00:57:59.027
I can make it, 
I can make it,

1017
00:57:59.061 --> 00:57:59.595
- I can make it!
- Sherlock!


1018
00:57:59.628 --> 00:58:00.262
He won't make it

1019
00:58:10.706 --> 00:58:13.108
No!

1020
00:58:20.182 --> 00:58:22.017
That's a dead end,
the other way.


1021
00:58:54.016 --> 00:58:56.351
No, no!

1022
00:59:03.292 --> 00:59:06.662
No, both ways are not good.

1023
00:59:23.545 --> 00:59:26.248
Scarface, I know where
Mack kept his money!


1024
00:59:26.482 --> 00:59:27.983
It's yours, for Katie.

1025
00:59:28.317 --> 00:59:30.285
Sherlock the Heartless?

1026
00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:33.489
You want the girl,
you'll hear from me soon.


1027
01:00:04.686 --> 01:00:05.721
I failed, Watson.

1028
01:00:06.822 --> 01:00:08.190
I let Scarface escape.

1029
01:00:10.659 --> 01:00:14.096
Don't worry, I doubt
he would know to find you here.


1030
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:16.231
You tried your best, Sherlock.

1031
01:00:16.465 --> 01:00:18.033
You mustn't blame yourself.

1032
01:00:19.868 --> 01:00:21.169
It was my fault.

1033
01:00:21.203 --> 01:00:23.305
I cannot believe
I lost her letter.


1034
01:00:25.173 --> 01:00:29.177
Katie, even the cleverest man
makes mistakes sometimes.


1035
01:00:30.178 --> 01:00:33.549
There was a time
when I had said similar words,


1036
01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:38.220
but I didn't expect that
the mistake would be my own.


1037
01:00:40.289 --> 01:00:41.390
We've got you now.

1038
01:00:42.357 --> 01:00:42.791
Where is Mack?

1039
01:00:43.825 --> 01:00:45.694
Sherlock,
are you hiding the fugitive?


1040
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:48.530
- What are you up to?
- Where is he?


1041
01:00:48.564 --> 01:00:49.398
Tell us now.

1042
01:00:50.132 --> 01:00:51.099
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

1043
01:00:51.133 --> 01:00:53.435
Hold on, don't come so close.

1044
01:00:53.468 --> 01:00:55.737
Blimey,
you're like a wet sponge.


1045
01:00:56.305 --> 01:00:59.074
Geez, men don't sob
like little children,


1046
01:00:59.374 --> 01:01:02.177
and what's that,
what's coming out of your nose?


1047
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.811
Stop that!

1048
01:01:09.651 --> 01:01:11.353
Scarface grew up around here,

1049
01:01:11.653 --> 01:01:14.189
a known bully
we were glad to be rid of.


1050
01:01:14.222 --> 01:01:16.325
He was muscle
for that whaling tycoon,


1051
01:01:16.358 --> 01:01:18.460
but once he went to jail,
life was better.


1052
01:01:18.694 --> 01:01:22.197
<i>Now that he's escaped prison,
everyone lives in fear again.</i>


1053
01:01:23.231 --> 01:01:24.733
We all know
you've been good to us.


1054
01:01:25.534 --> 01:01:28.503
Just not right that
your daughter's in danger.


1055
01:01:29.504 --> 01:01:30.505
Thank you, George.

1056
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.309
Besides
his two former underlings,


1057
01:01:34.343 --> 01:01:36.178
some other fools are willing
to be his minions.


1058
01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:39.681
Be careful tomorrow
during the hostage exchange.


1059
01:01:40.215 --> 01:01:42.384
If you need any help,
give us a holler.


1060
01:01:42.818 --> 01:01:44.152
We have your back.

1061
01:01:44.954 --> 01:01:46.655
Scarface is not to be trusted.

1062
01:01:47.222 --> 01:01:48.323
I appreciate the sentiment,

1063
01:01:48.357 --> 01:01:49.791
but I must
take care of this alone.


1064
01:01:50.225 --> 01:01:52.628
Where would you find the money
to pay the ransom?


1065
01:01:53.261 --> 01:01:53.795
Can't offer money...

1066
01:01:55.464 --> 01:01:57.666
I can only offer my life.

1067
01:02:30.332 --> 01:02:31.266
What is it?

1068
01:02:32.267 --> 01:02:33.335
Onwards, Watson.

1069
01:02:33.368 --> 01:02:34.770
Where to?

1070
01:02:54.756 --> 01:02:57.492
You have me,
now let my daughter go.


1071
01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.428
Where's my money?

1072
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:01.229
Listen, Scarface,

1073
01:03:02.464 --> 01:03:03.532
we wouldn't walk out of here
alive if I brought the money.


1074
01:03:04.399 --> 01:03:06.735
Let go of my daughter
and I'll stay.


1075
01:03:07.335 --> 01:03:09.604
Once Katie is safe, someone
will move the money here.


1076
01:03:09.638 --> 01:03:10.472
Move?

1077
01:03:11.974 --> 01:03:13.575
I don't care for the poor.

1078
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:15.711
You never believed the press.

1079
01:03:16.378 --> 01:03:19.015
I have so much stolen money,

1080
01:03:19.048 --> 01:03:20.482
10 men couldn't carry it all.

1081
01:03:20.515 --> 01:03:22.417
- Really?
- You're now a fugitive.


1082
01:03:23.019 --> 01:03:24.954
My money can buy your freedom.

1083
01:03:26.388 --> 01:03:28.890
Take the deal
or kiss the money goodbye.


1084
01:03:29.691 --> 01:03:30.826
You're a smart man.

1085
01:03:30.859 --> 01:03:32.360
You know it's the right move.

1086
01:03:35.864 --> 01:03:37.499
Bloody hell!

1087
01:03:44.339 --> 01:03:44.906
This way.

1088
01:03:45.307 --> 01:03:45.874
Right.

1089
01:03:49.045 --> 01:03:50.779
Your father asked us
to come get you.


1090
01:03:50.812 --> 01:03:51.646
Are you hurt?

1091
01:03:52.347 --> 01:03:54.951
No, Father...

1092
01:03:55.985 --> 01:03:58.353
traded his life for mine.

1093
01:03:58.386 --> 01:03:59.454
Don't lose hope just yet.

1094
01:03:59.488 --> 01:04:02.557
We can still save him,
but you'll have to trust me.


1095
01:04:06.996 --> 01:04:08.597
Your father asked me
to give this to you.


1096
01:04:10.332 --> 01:04:11.968
Scarface only
broke out of jail recently.


1097
01:04:12.534 --> 01:04:14.503
He couldn't have prepared
two captivity sites.


1098
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:17.405
If we can locate
where he kept you last night,


1099
01:04:17.439 --> 01:04:18.874
we can probably
save your father.


1100
01:04:19.775 --> 01:04:21.276
But I was blindfolded.

1101
01:04:22.778 --> 01:04:24.046
We first need to go to my home

1102
01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.380
and pick up a secret weapon,

1103
01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:29.986
and as much as it pains me,
I must ask someone for help.


1104
01:04:32.387 --> 01:04:34.489
Are those begging tears I see?

1105
01:04:34.523 --> 01:04:36.525
You want tears,
I can ask Dr. Watson.


1106
01:04:36.558 --> 01:04:37.726
Ah, never mind.

1107
01:04:37.759 --> 01:04:39.327
How may I be of assistance?

1108
01:04:39.828 --> 01:04:41.530
In the entire city of London,

1109
01:04:41.563 --> 01:04:44.499
you're the only man capable of
taking down Scarface.


1110
01:04:44.533 --> 01:04:45.734
You're a wise man.

1111
01:04:46.102 --> 01:04:47.836
Like I said, Mack is mine.

1112
01:04:48.037 --> 01:04:51.306
Catching two fugitives at once
sounds smashing.


1113
01:04:52.374 --> 01:04:54.977
Katie, you don't have to worry
now that I'm in charge.


1114
01:04:55.011 --> 01:04:57.079
I'll rescue your father and
then,


1115
01:04:57.113 --> 01:05:00.515
back to prison,
money back guaranteed.


1116
01:05:01.083 --> 01:05:02.684
Sherlock, what's the plan?

1117
01:05:02.717 --> 01:05:04.053
After we parted the crossing,

1118
01:05:04.086 --> 01:05:05.854
where did Scarface
then take you?


1119
01:05:06.088 --> 01:05:08.723
I woke up by a bay
with many old ships


1120
01:05:08.757 --> 01:05:10.559
reeking with a nauseous,
fishy smell.


1121
01:05:10.859 --> 01:05:12.727
After he met up
with his associates,


1122
01:05:12.761 --> 01:05:15.998
he covered my eyes with cloth
and pulled me onto a carriage.


1123
01:05:16.032 --> 01:05:17.599
I couldn't see anything
after that.


1124
01:05:19.568 --> 01:05:20.569
How about during the ride?

1125
01:05:20.937 --> 01:05:22.370
Did you hear anything
on the way?


1126
01:05:23.072 --> 01:05:24.773
Any distinctive smells?

1127
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.843
I'm pretty sure
we crossed two rivers.


1128
01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:30.545
I could hear the horses' hooves

1129
01:05:30.579 --> 01:05:34.016
as we crossed a stone bridge
and a wood one.


1130
01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:37.086
If this was the starting point,
crossing two rivers...


1131
01:05:38.587 --> 01:05:39.021
Head north.

1132
01:05:39.588 --> 01:05:40.355
Let's go.

1133
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:41.389
Let's go!

1134
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.467
The stone bridge.

1135
01:05:57.073 --> 01:05:59.741
Yes, I hear the first bridge.

1136
01:06:05.114 --> 01:06:07.515
And now,
this is the second bridge.


1137
01:06:08.617 --> 01:06:11.053
There should be church bells
a bit further on.


1138
01:06:12.922 --> 01:06:13.923
Turn right up ahead.

1139
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:27.937
Hm. Which way
should we take now?


1140
01:06:28.971 --> 01:06:31.439
Hm. Three roads.

1141
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:33.508
- What's next?
- Um. Well...


1142
01:06:33.541 --> 01:06:34.542
Well, what else did you hear?

1143
01:06:34.576 --> 01:06:36.544
No, I didn't hear any sounds.

1144
01:06:36.578 --> 01:06:39.081
What about smells,
any special odors?


1145
01:06:39.514 --> 01:06:40.849
No, nothing.

1146
01:06:41.917 --> 01:06:42.884
Tough luck, let's go back.

1147
01:06:42.918 --> 01:06:45.887
Don't you think we could
explore all three roads?


1148
01:06:45.922 --> 01:06:47.756
We might discover something
if we do.


1149
01:06:48.057 --> 01:06:50.960
This is a valuable lesson,
pay attention now.


1150
01:06:51.526 --> 01:06:53.095
Your father chose to be a thief.

1151
01:06:53.628 --> 01:06:56.065
If he had behaved like
other law-abiding citizens,


1152
01:06:56.598 --> 01:06:58.968
maybe he wouldn't have
ended up like this.


1153
01:06:59.235 --> 01:07:01.536
When you become a mother
in the future,


1154
01:07:01.569 --> 01:07:03.039
take good care of your children.

1155
01:07:03.072 --> 01:07:05.207
Don't ever
send them to orphanages.


1156
01:07:05.241 --> 01:07:07.243
I remember now.
After hearing the church bells,


1157
01:07:07.276 --> 01:07:09.011
I felt pressure in my ears.

1158
01:07:09.744 --> 01:07:10.545
Pressure?

1159
01:07:10.578 --> 01:07:11.113
Mm-hm.

1160
01:07:13.049 --> 01:07:15.483
The road you took
was the uphill one on the left.


1161
01:07:16.185 --> 01:07:18.787
The stress of weighted air
is air pressure.


1162
01:07:19.155 --> 01:07:21.756
On ground level,
the air pressure inside


1163
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:23.892
<i>and outside the eardrum
is the same,</i>


1164
01:07:23.926 --> 01:07:25.527
<i>so there is no discomfort.</i>

1165
01:07:26.828 --> 01:07:28.230
<i>But traveling uphill within
a short period of time,</i>


1166
01:07:28.697 --> 01:07:30.099
<i>the pressure
outside the eardrum</i>


1167
01:07:30.132 --> 01:07:31.733
<i>is lower than
the pressure inside,</i>


1168
01:07:32.068 --> 01:07:33.902
<i>causing discomfort in the ears.</i>

1169
01:07:35.603 --> 01:07:37.239
The uphill road leads to
a neighborhood,


1170
01:07:37.273 --> 01:07:39.041
about 20 to 30 houses.

1171
01:07:40.142 --> 01:07:41.043
Let's take a look.

1172
01:07:55.824 --> 01:07:58.260
20 to 30 houses?
We can't knock on every door.


1173
01:07:58.928 --> 01:07:59.828
I remember now,

1174
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:01.030
when they were pushing me
into the house,


1175
01:08:01.063 --> 01:08:03.565
<i>I saw some small whitish,
yellowish flowers</i>


1176
01:08:03.598 --> 01:08:04.033
<i>on the ground.</i>

1177
01:08:05.968 --> 01:08:06.701
Did you hear that?

1178
01:08:07.136 --> 01:08:08.037
Target confirmed.

1179
01:08:18.713 --> 01:08:19.415
Let's pull over.

1180
01:08:19.448 --> 01:08:21.117
The wagon might alert Scarface.

1181
01:08:23.953 --> 01:08:26.055
Why don't you guys go ahead
and find the house?


1182
01:08:26.821 --> 01:08:28.290
I'll stay here
and protect Katie.


1183
01:08:29.358 --> 01:08:30.192
Seriously?

1184
01:08:32.995 --> 01:08:34.763
Actually, I'd like to stay back
and protect Katie too.


1185
01:08:34.796 --> 01:08:36.098
Why can't you be brave, huh?

1186
01:08:36.731 --> 01:08:39.101
Because
I'm slightly traumatized.


1187
01:08:39.135 --> 01:08:40.069
What a bunch of mice.

1188
01:08:42.637 --> 01:08:44.206
It's fine,
I'll go with Detective Riller.


1189
01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:47.209
Katie,
please protect these two for me.


1190
01:08:48.244 --> 01:08:49.211
What?

1191
01:09:00.356 --> 01:09:02.158
Have you seen
anything suspicious?


1192
01:09:02.191 --> 01:09:04.126
Every house is very colorful.

1193
01:09:09.265 --> 01:09:11.967
Maybe Katie's eyes
had played tricks on her.


1194
01:09:12.935 --> 01:09:15.603
She was terrified and
blindfolded, but she's smart.


1195
01:09:15.837 --> 01:09:17.006
I do believe her.

1196
01:09:18.907 --> 01:09:19.674
Ah.

1197
01:09:20.976 --> 01:09:23.778
I must say,
the shadow is really pretty.


1198
01:09:24.646 --> 01:09:26.748
It's glistening
like a set of gold teeth.


1199
01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:29.952
What is it?

1200
01:09:35.723 --> 01:09:36.624
This is the house.

1201
01:09:38.893 --> 01:09:42.131
I only see iron gates, where
are you seeing the flowers?


1202
01:09:42.398 --> 01:09:43.933
I worry about you, Sherlock.

1203
01:09:44.732 --> 01:09:46.235
There are no flowers
at this place,


1204
01:09:46.936 --> 01:09:47.937
<i>but when the sun is shining</i>

1205
01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:49.205
<i>from behind
the iron gates at 10 AM,</i>


1206
01:09:50.072 --> 01:09:52.208
<i>sunlight would shine through
the small perforations</i>


1207
01:09:52.241 --> 01:09:53.042
<i>in the iron gates</i>

1208
01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:55.244
<i>and cast glistening patterns
on the ground.</i>


1209
01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:58.847
<i>Those must be the small,
whitish flowers that Katie saw.</i>


1210
01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.788
Here's food.

1211
01:10:08.224 --> 01:10:08.890
Huh?

1212
01:10:09.992 --> 01:10:13.761
Young lad, the food is
too far away for me to reach.


1213
01:10:15.164 --> 01:10:16.098
I'm not your servant.

1214
01:10:16.132 --> 01:10:18.633
Crawl over here and
gobble it up like a dog.


1215
01:10:18.934 --> 01:10:20.002
Serves you right.

1216
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:21.096
You need to pull it.

1217
01:11:22.965 --> 01:11:23.966
What is that?

1218
01:11:26.135 --> 01:11:26.768
Hand it over.

1219
01:11:43.118 --> 01:11:44.286
No you don't!

1220
01:11:56.131 --> 01:11:57.032
Ha-ha!

1221
01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.401
Let me go!

1222
01:11:59.435 --> 01:12:00.868
Let go of me right now!

1223
01:12:01.337 --> 01:12:02.438
Watch this kid.

1224
01:12:04.573 --> 01:12:06.774
Scarface,
you're totally surrounded!


1225
01:12:07.109 --> 01:12:09.111
Be smart and
surrender yourself now.


1226
01:12:12.248 --> 01:12:14.149
It's too dangerous,
please wait.


1227
01:12:19.388 --> 01:12:20.155
Huh?

1228
01:12:25.928 --> 01:12:29.797
Hey, we had a deal and now
you have people come after me.


1229
01:12:29.831 --> 01:12:32.234
You can't trust the word
of a criminal these days.


1230
01:12:32.268 --> 01:12:33.335
Time to say goodbye.

1231
01:12:37.306 --> 01:12:39.108
You're White Storm.

1232
01:12:42.311 --> 01:12:44.046
Katie stay back, get away!

1233
01:12:45.347 --> 01:12:49.485
Scarface, here's what you want,
now release my father.


1234
01:12:50.052 --> 01:12:52.421
I knew it,
your generosity was fake.


1235
01:12:52.454 --> 01:12:55.890
You stashed the jewelry
and put on an act of nobility.


1236
01:12:55.924 --> 01:12:58.227
That's right,
my generosity was an act.


1237
01:12:58.927 --> 01:13:01.163
I fooled the world
that I was a noble thief.


1238
01:13:01.196 --> 01:13:03.198
Only children would believe
such a sham.


1239
01:13:05.434 --> 01:13:08.270
White Storm,
you're to blame for all this.


1240
01:13:08.304 --> 01:13:10.306
Nobody crosses me, nobody!

1241
01:13:10.339 --> 01:13:12.141
You're gonna get
what you deserve.


1242
01:13:12.174 --> 01:13:14.076
Unlike you,
I'm a man of my word.


1243
01:13:23.185 --> 01:13:24.320
It's dangerous, get away.

1244
01:13:24.353 --> 01:13:25.287
Father!

1245
01:13:28.324 --> 01:13:29.425
Father!

1246
01:13:29.458 --> 01:13:31.026
- Run away.
- Father!


1247
01:13:55.284 --> 01:13:56.051
Father?

1248
01:13:56.918 --> 01:13:58.921
I'm sorry.
I failed you as a father.


1249
01:14:01.156 --> 01:14:02.191
Let me take a look.

1250
01:14:04.259 --> 01:14:05.527
And what about this boy?

1251
01:14:09.198 --> 01:14:11.166
Go on, you want to go to jail?

1252
01:14:12.134 --> 01:14:12.935
You're letting me off?

1253
01:14:12.968 --> 01:14:16.004
Go, but just
remember this lesson,


1254
01:14:16.305 --> 01:14:18.407
stay in school and
learn right from wrong.


1255
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.143
Grow up a good man, got it?

1256
01:14:24.012 --> 01:14:26.148
Didn't you say that
all thieves must be caught?


1257
01:14:26.181 --> 01:14:26.648
Yeah.

1258
01:14:27.915 --> 01:14:30.185
Locking him in jail would only
expose him to bad influences.


1259
01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.623
The bullets didn't hit
any vital organs, he'll be fine.


1260
01:14:35.524 --> 01:14:36.458
Father!

1261
01:14:39.328 --> 01:14:41.997
Mr. Holmes, thank you.

1262
01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:47.169
You should be thanking Katie
instead.


1263
01:14:47.202 --> 01:14:49.505
We were able to find you
because of her brilliance.


1264
01:14:57.279 --> 01:15:00.482
Mack, I understand why
you tarnished your own image


1265
01:15:00.516 --> 01:15:03.652
in front of the boy,
shattering his idea of a thief.


1266
01:15:04.453 --> 01:15:07.122
But I'm curious about
the jewelry that you gave Katie.


1267
01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:11.160
Oh, that necklace
is my family heirloom.


1268
01:15:11.593 --> 01:15:13.695
<i>I didn't have a chance
to give it to Katie's mother,</i>


1269
01:15:14.196 --> 01:15:16.031
<i>but now I can
pass it on to Katie</i>


1270
01:15:16.064 --> 01:15:19.134
as a wedding gift for
her and her husband's future.


1271
01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:42.257
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!


1272
01:15:45.127 --> 01:15:47.563
- Goodbye!
- Bye, Katie!


1273
01:15:47.596 --> 01:15:49.298
- Bye-bye, Katie!
- Bye!


1274
01:15:49.331 --> 01:15:50.966
- Bye!
- We'll see you again soon!


1275
01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:53.135
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!


1276
01:15:55.037 --> 01:15:55.437
Oh!

1277
01:15:57.206 --> 01:15:58.140
Again?

1278
01:16:04.313 --> 01:16:06.315
Father, take care!

1279
01:16:06.348 --> 01:16:07.516
You too, Katie!

1280
01:18:30.459 --> 01:18:31.393
Ah!

1281
01:18:32.861 --> 01:18:34.429
Wow, what a delight.

1282
01:18:34.463 --> 01:18:36.231
- Wow!
- So many cakes.


1283
01:18:37.399 --> 01:18:38.667
How can we finish them all?

1284
01:18:40.736 --> 01:18:41.470
Excuse me.

1285
01:18:42.471 --> 01:18:44.306
Mr. Holmes,
ever since you caught Scarface,


1286
01:18:44.339 --> 01:18:46.341
you haven't come by
for quite a while.


1287
01:18:46.675 --> 01:18:48.210
May I have your autograph,
please?


1288
01:18:50.245 --> 01:18:51.213
My pleasure.

1289
01:18:52.314 --> 01:18:54.383
Your lemon cream cake
must be as popular as ever.


1290
01:18:54.416 --> 01:18:55.817
I don't see any left today.

1291
01:18:55.851 --> 01:18:58.220
Yes, they sell out quickly
every day.


1292
01:18:58.654 --> 01:19:01.289
Oh, I must have been
very lucky then.


1293
01:19:01.323 --> 01:19:03.692
I would not have solved the case
if not for that cake.


1294
01:19:03.725 --> 01:19:05.227
Solved the case?

1295
01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:08.263
Now that you mention it,
I should tell you.


1296
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:09.297
Tell me what?

1297
01:19:10.265 --> 01:19:11.466
Remember how I told you
the other customers


1298
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.434
bought the rest of the cake

1299
01:19:12.467 --> 01:19:14.670
and there was
only one slice left for you?


1300
01:19:14.703 --> 01:19:15.303
I remember.

1301
01:19:16.505 --> 01:19:18.740
When I said other customers,
there was actually only one.


1302
01:19:19.274 --> 01:19:20.709
He had a scar under
his right eye


1303
01:19:20.742 --> 01:19:21.944
that looked like a teardrop,

1304
01:19:21.978 --> 01:19:23.378
a very distinguishable mark.

1305
01:19:23.845 --> 01:19:25.982
He actually paid for
that last slice you ate.


1306
01:19:26.015 --> 01:19:27.683
He told me to
only give it to you,


1307
01:19:27.716 --> 01:19:29.317
but I must keep it a secret.

1308
01:19:29.351 --> 01:19:30.652
It was a surprise for you.

1309
01:19:34.523 --> 01:19:36.324
We meet in person at last.

1310
01:19:36.358 --> 01:19:37.259
Hello, there, White Storm.

1311
01:19:37.292 --> 01:19:39.494
That cake happens to be
Katie's favorite.


1312
01:19:39.528 --> 01:19:41.730
Her benefactor buys one for her
every year.


1313
01:19:42.031 --> 01:19:42.831
Such a giving person.

1314
01:19:43.565 --> 01:19:46.334
Even if you spent
all of your money,


1315
01:19:46.368 --> 01:19:48.370
it would barely feed them
for a week.


1316
01:19:48.403 --> 01:19:49.271
What have you heard, Bunny?

1317
01:19:50.205 --> 01:19:50.973
Somebody's peddling jewelry
by the slums


1318
01:19:51.007 --> 01:19:52.942
near the riverside
in the East End.


1319
01:19:55.377 --> 01:19:59.982
I heard that someone is peddling
stolen goods by the slum area,


1320
01:20:00.016 --> 01:20:02.250
near the riverside
in the East End.


1321
01:20:02.584 --> 01:20:03.518
Shall we go look?

1322
01:20:04.853 --> 01:20:06.555
<i>Was
"Heartless Sherlock" your idea?</i>


1323
01:20:07.355 --> 01:20:08.657
I wish I were that creative.

1324
01:20:13.062 --> 01:20:14.931
Huh? What is this?

1325
01:20:16.765 --> 01:20:17.566
Brilliant.

1326
01:20:42.858 --> 01:20:47.858
