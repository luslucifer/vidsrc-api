1
00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.293
What do you say
to the nice young man?

2
00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:54.713
Aren't you gonna say something?
Shake? Thatta girl.


3
00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:58.300
That's fine!

4
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.969
Bye.

5
00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:54.482
All right, all right, 
I'm a' coming...

6
00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:57.485
- What can I do for you ?
I'm looking for a room.


7
00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.446
Overnight? No, it'll be at least a week.

8
00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:01.656
Maybe two or three.

9
00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:02.657
Billy Lee!

10
00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:04.867
Charge'll be $2.50

11
00:03:05.243 --> 00:03:08.453
We always make reduction for our
permanent temporary guests.


12
00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:11.748
Well, that's very nice of you.
- Put your name and address here.


13
00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:18.506
Billy Lee! You wake up!

14
00:03:19.507 --> 00:03:21.300
I was just resting.

15
00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.511
Well, I'd thought you'd taken root.

16
00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:28.891
Go on up to 104
and get it aired out.

17
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.977
and see if Mabel's dusted, too.

18
00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:31.978
Well, ma'am.

19
00:03:33.187 --> 00:03:34.397
Move!

20
00:03:35.273 --> 00:03:38.568
I swear I believe that boy has got
nigger blood in him somewhere.


21
00:03:39.193 --> 00:03:40.486
You don't have to
go to all this trouble.

22
00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:42.196
It won't take a minute.

23
00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.865
I suppose you are a salesman...

24
00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:46.867
You might say
I'm in social work.


25
00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:48.911
I've come to do what
I can for the town.

26
00:03:50.454 --> 00:03:51.956
The integration problem.

27
00:03:52.957 --> 00:03:54.750
Oh, that, but that's all over.

28
00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:58.546
I mean the've got 10 niggers enrolled
already in the school.


29
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.339
And they're startin' Monday.

30
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:02.842
Yes, I know.
And do you think it's right?


31
00:04:03.134 --> 00:04:05.011
No, I sure don't!

32
00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:08.014
And neither does nobody, but it's the law.

33
00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:09.932
Whose law?

34
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:13.603
It's ok, you can come up now.

35
00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:16.397
D'you want Billy Lee to tote your bags?

36
00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:17.857
Oh, no. I've got them.

37
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:18.900
Suit yourself.

38
00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.700
Right this way.

39
00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:30.244
Come on baby. I'm on fire.

40
00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:32.455
Stop Sam.
You will tear my robe.


41
00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.624
Oh, honey for God's sake, please.

42
00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:36.751
- Stop it.

43
00:04:39.253 --> 00:04:41.339
Anything you want just let me know.

44
00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.549
Thank you very much.
Oh, there is one thing...


45
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.051
What's that?

46
00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:46.552
Privacy.

47
00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:48.513
I 'd like to take
care of the room myself.

48
00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.223
I guess we can arrange that.

49
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:52.642
Good.

50
00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:54.520
We're gonna be friends, aren't we?

51
00:04:55.312 --> 00:04:57.105
Don't see any reason why not.

52
00:05:06.113 --> 00:05:09.408
Now you stop that carryin' on right this instant!
You hear me now?


53
00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:13.079
Why, lookie here - a peeping Tom.

54
00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:16.582
Why, Sam Griffin, you haven't got
the modesty of a hog!


55
00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.042
When I have to?

56
00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.002
You gonna let her talk
to me that way, honey?

57
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:20.670
Shut up!

58
00:05:20.878 --> 00:05:21.963
She's mad 'cause I
won't give her a kiss.

59
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:23.089
Now you listen, Sam,

60
00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:26.384
I've got a new guest...
right down the hall


61
00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:27.761
And he is a gentleman.

62
00:05:28.053 --> 00:05:31.557
So am I, I've just got this terrible case of sex appeal,
Not a thing I can do.


63
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:35.226
I'm sorry. Mrs. Lambert...

64
00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:38.229
We won't cause you any trouble...
Sam, I'm gonna kill you...


65
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.552
Mr. Russell, I am sorry to
interrupt your meditation,


66
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.679
but your root beer is ready.

67
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.555
Man, you're mean!

68
00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:13.973
Hi.

69
00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.058
Hi!

70
00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:19.103
You are authorized to make
bussiness transactions?


71
00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.396
Sir?

72
00:06:20.563 --> 00:06:23.941
I give you two dollar bills, you give me
a cup of coffee and nineteen dimes for the telephone?


73
00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:25.943
All right!

74
00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:30.531
Flip you, double or nothing.

75
00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:33.326
Just put 10 cents on the counter.

76
00:06:33.702 --> 00:06:35.913
Boy, you're the meanest girl
on the face of the earth!

77
00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:39.124
Be careful, mister, she's liable to bite
your head off.


78
00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:41.335
Thank you very much.

79
00:06:41.543 --> 00:06:42.586
See you at school.

80
00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:44.797
Are you really the meanest girl
on the face of the earth?


81
00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:46.507
That's what people tell me.

82
00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:49.468
Oh, they're wrong, you
don't look mean at all.

83
00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:54.472
Thank you.

84
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.557
- Do you go to school around here?
- Uh-huh.


85
00:06:56.974 --> 00:06:58.851
I didn't know they
had a college in Caxton.

86
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.353
They don't.

87
00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:02.939
You don't go to high school, do you?

88
00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.945
My, my, they do grow
things fast here, don't they?

89
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.323
You know, I've heard an
awful lot about southern hospitality

90
00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:13.242
The question is, does it really exist?

91
00:07:13.951 --> 00:07:15.035
Well sure, I guess so.

92
00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:18.580
No, I mean, really. see here's the thing...
I've just moved into Caxton


93
00:07:18.747 --> 00:07:20.124
and I'm anxious to
meet some young people here.

94
00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:22.209
But I don't have any contacts.

95
00:07:22.501 --> 00:07:24.420
Now, isn't that a sad story?

96
00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:29.298
Hi, Dad.
I'll check you later.


97
00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:31.134
Late again?

98
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.219
Sorry, Al.
That's okay, Dad.


99
00:07:33.428 --> 00:07:34.387
How's it going, Tom?

100
00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:36.389
Oh, all right, I guess.

101
00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:37.390
Kind of surprised, though.

102
00:07:37.598 --> 00:07:40.601
Looks like the school's gonna
open without any trouble.


103
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:41.562
Well, I hope so.

104
00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.231
Goodbye Mr. Hames.

105
00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:47.526
Goodbye honey.
Nice having you work for me.


106
00:07:47.776 --> 00:07:48.444
See you later, Ted.

107
00:07:48.652 --> 00:07:51.530
Do you think it's all right for a girl my age
to go out with older men?


108
00:07:51.697 --> 00:07:52.156
Hmm?

109
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:54.533
Oh, never mind.

110
00:07:58.996 --> 00:07:59.997
Hi, Mom.

111
00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.292
Sorry, honey.

112
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.501
Well, you could have called.

113
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.919
- I had a lovely roast.
- I know.


114
00:08:08.713 --> 00:08:10.506
I'm a terrible husband.

115
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:12.800
Oh, sit down, I'll fix you something.

116
00:08:15.888 --> 00:08:18.182
- What's wrong?
- Well...


117
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:21.477
It isn't anything, actually, but...

118
00:08:21.643 --> 00:08:24.646
I had a kind of funny
phone call a few minutes ago...


119
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.108
It upset me.
Who was it, a salesman?


120
00:08:29.777 --> 00:08:32.154
No. Somebody making a survey or something.

121
00:08:33.655 --> 00:08:35.199
Well?

122
00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:37.701
Well ..

123
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.078
He wanted to know what I thought

124
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.829
about my daughter sitting in a
classroom with a bunch of nigras.


125
00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.541
What did you say?

126
00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:48.921
Well, I didn't know exactly what to say...

127
00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:51.924
But I told him the
truth--that I didn't like it.

128
00:08:51.924 --> 00:08:52.925
He give a name?

129
00:08:53.842 --> 00:08:55.135
I don't remember.

130
00:08:55.302 --> 00:08:58.222
Cramer, that's his name. Adam Cramer.

131
00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:01.016
Made sense, too.
Best sense I've heard in a year.


132
00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:02.226
Where's the coffee?

133
00:09:02.518 --> 00:09:04.186
Sit down, Dad, 
I'll get you some...

134
00:09:04.895 --> 00:09:07.106
First thing you get around this house
you gotta ask for it.


135
00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:08.899
What's the matter with you?

136
00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:11.902
Mad 'cause we got somebody in town
with a little gumption?


137
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:13.696
Afraid you're gonna get showed up?

138
00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.489
Look, I'm tired.

139
00:09:15.698 --> 00:09:16.990
From what?

140
00:09:17.282 --> 00:09:19.450
Sittin' around on your dead rump all day?

141
00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:21.078
- Oh, Dad!
- It's the truth!


142
00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:22.663
Everyone knows it.

143
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.166
River could bust loose and flood the whole damn town.
And whattaya think he'd do?


144
00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:28.043
Write editorials!

145
00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:31.463
It takes work and muscles, boy,
to stop a flood...


146
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.758
And that's what we got on our hands--
a great big, black flood!


147
00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:37.219
You cut out that kind
of talk in front of Ella!

148
00:09:40.222 --> 00:09:42.641
Well, I guess that's what happens...

149
00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:44.518
When you get old and sick.

150
00:09:44.727 --> 00:09:46.979
People treat you like dirt...spit on you.

151
00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:48.689
Waitin' around for you to die.

152
00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:50.190
All right.

153
00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:52.109
Let's forget it.

154
00:09:52.318 --> 00:09:53.986
Ruth, get my medicine.

155
00:09:54.195 --> 00:09:56.405
Your husband is doing his best to
give me a heart attack.


156
00:09:58.574 --> 00:09:59.825
What about you, Ella?

157
00:10:01.493 --> 00:10:03.996
What do you think about sitting in a room
with a bunch of big buck niggers?


158
00:10:04.163 --> 00:10:05.956
Ella thinks the same way I do.

159
00:10:06.582 --> 00:10:08.667
She doesn't like it.
But it's a law.


160
00:10:09.168 --> 00:10:11.170
Can't you get that through
your thick skull?


161
00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:12.463
A law!

162
00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:17.051
Well what has he
got his back up about?

163
00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:21.930
Good morning.

164
00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:25.017
- Morning. How's your social work coming along?
We're off to a fine start.


165
00:10:26.144 --> 00:10:29.814
Good morning, good morning, Mother Lambert. My but you're
looking as pretty as ever this morning. Gimme a little kiss.


166
00:10:32.317 --> 00:10:34.026
Hello there, is this the
gentleman you were telling us about?

167
00:10:34.193 --> 00:10:36.695
Mr. Adam Cramer,
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.


168
00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:38.489
- Happy to know you, Adam.
- Pleased to meet you.


169
00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:40.783
Hope we didn't disturb you any
last night.


170
00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:42.117
Oh no, no. Not a bit.

171
00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:44.411
- Had your breakfast yet?
- Not I haven't.


172
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.412
Neither have we and we were just headed
down to the Palace.


173
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:47.915
If you'd care to join us,
you're welcome, isn't he, honey?


174
00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:50.876
Yeah, sure.

175
00:10:51.168 --> 00:10:52.544
Come on, treat's on Sam Griffin.

176
00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:54.046
You've convinced me.

177
00:10:59.844 --> 00:11:02.472
Hoo-wee! Gonna be another scorcher.
Just down the street here, Adam.


178
00:11:02.764 --> 00:11:05.433
Not much to look at, the the food?
Terrible.


179
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.936
Didn't make too many demands on you last
night, did I honey?


180
00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:08.937
Sam...

181
00:11:09.354 --> 00:11:10.021
Right in here.

182
00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:15.985
How do you do there?

183
00:11:16.026 --> 00:11:17.069
Good morning, Gertie, let's
have three orders of primastan

184
00:11:17.736 --> 00:11:21.198
covered with forder's oil
and a little soomus on the side.


185
00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:27.788
- Scrambled eggs and coffee. How 'bout you, Adam?
- Same.


186
00:11:27.997 --> 00:11:30.207
Make it three.
Don't forget the forder's oil!


187
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.710
Gets her every time.

188
00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:35.589
- Where are you from, Adam...?
- Los Angeles


189
00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:38.341
L.A, no kidding, why
that's Vi's home town!


190
00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:39.384
Small world, huh?

191
00:11:39.593 --> 00:11:41.886
How about that, honey,
say you two ought to be thick as thieves.


192
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.139
I was in California, once--promoter at the fairgrounds.

193
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.181
Doing?

194
00:11:46.182 --> 00:11:47.641
I was pushing pens,
same I'm doing here.


195
00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:50.436
- I made 300 bucks a day.
- I take it you're a salesman?


196
00:11:50.853 --> 00:11:53.939
That's a fancy way to put it.
Pitch man'd be more like it.


197
00:11:54.356 --> 00:11:57.943
Say, I'm working a dime story over in Faragut today
Why don't you come on over? It's only 40 miles.


198
00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:00.529
I'd like to. Your work sounds fascinating.

199
00:12:00.738 --> 00:12:02.114
What's your line, Mr. Cramer?

200
00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:05.826
Social reform.

201
00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:08.121
Mmm. Be in town long?

202
00:12:09.122 --> 00:12:10.206
Quite a while, yes.... you?

203
00:12:10.707 --> 00:12:13.001
Oh, all summer.
We like it here, don't we, honey?


204
00:12:14.586 --> 00:12:15.712
Sure, Sam.

205
00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:18.798
Caxton's a fine place, real fine people.

206
00:12:19.674 --> 00:12:23.678
- Something wrong, Vi? Oh, no, Sam. 
I got a headache.

207
00:12:23.678 --> 00:12:25.763
I think I'll... 
I'll go back to the room and lie down.

208
00:12:26.096 --> 00:12:28.307
I'll go with you, baby. No, no, please, 
I'm all right.

209
00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:29.600
Don't get up.

210
00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:34.355
Is a pleasure to have met you, Mrs. Griffin.
We're gonna be friends, aren't we?


211
00:12:34.563 --> 00:12:36.065
Why, heck, you're friends now.

212
00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:38.734
I'll be all right, Sam.

213
00:12:42.155 --> 00:12:44.449
- God, she's something, ain't she?
- Very attractive.


214
00:12:45.158 --> 00:12:46.117
Wondeful woman, Adam.

215
00:12:46.826 --> 00:12:47.827
Really wonderful.

216
00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:52.707
Hate to leave her alone so much of the time.
She kinda gets bored.


217
00:12:52.832 --> 00:12:54.417
Well, if there's anything I can do just...

218
00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:57.420
Faragut's only a one night view..

219
00:12:57.712 --> 00:13:00.298
That's the kind of absence that makes the
heart grown fonder if you get what I mean.


220
00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:03.801
Where are them eggs?

221
00:13:10.182 --> 00:13:12.768
- Hi - You are the driver?
- Sure am.


222
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:14.062
You know where nigger town is?

223
00:13:14.062 --> 00:13:15.480
- Yes, sir.
- You take me there?


224
00:14:33.225 --> 00:14:36.019
- Take me to 22 Myrtle Wood lane.
-Are you through here?


225
00:14:36.811 --> 00:14:38.104
For the moment...

226
00:14:57.749 --> 00:15:01.211
- All right, think we'll win?
-Don't we always?


227
00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:02.754
Beautiful horse.

228
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:07.551
- Who are you?
- My name is Adam Cramer.


229
00:15:07.926 --> 00:15:10.220
Your housekeeper said this'd be a good
time for us to talk.


230
00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:11.721
Well, what's on your mind?

231
00:15:12.013 --> 00:15:13.640
Quite a bit, sir,
I think you'll be interested


232
00:15:14.015 --> 00:15:16.518
Well, you tell me all
about whatever it is you're selling...

233
00:15:17.102 --> 00:15:18.311
In a letter.

234
00:15:18.603 --> 00:15:20.105
- Keep on working him, Ray.
- Yes sir.


235
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.191
Mr. Shipman?

236
00:15:25.193 --> 00:15:26.987
I'm not selling anything.

237
00:15:27.488 --> 00:15:28.614
Then what are you after?

238
00:15:29.615 --> 00:15:31.199
A little courtesy for one thing.

239
00:15:31.992 --> 00:15:35.537
Mr. Shipman, I've traveled all the way from Washington DC
to talk to you.


240
00:15:37.122 --> 00:15:38.832
- Washington?
- Yes sir. D.C.


241
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.169
- Well, let's go over here to the shade.
- Good.


242
00:15:42.586 --> 00:15:43.753
Lovely place you have.

243
00:15:43.753 --> 00:15:45.172
Thank you.

244
00:15:45.672 --> 00:15:47.174
Well now, what is
it you want to know?

245
00:15:48.341 --> 00:15:52.262
Well sir, you see, I represent
the Patrick Henry Society.


246
00:15:52.554 --> 00:15:54.723
And what we'd like to know is just how you stand...
are you for integration


247
00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:56.349
Or against it.

248
00:15:56.725 --> 00:15:59.102
Well, that's a stupid question, young man.
I'm a southerner.


249
00:15:59.144 --> 00:16:00.937
Sit down, sit down.
-Thank you


250
00:16:01.522 --> 00:16:04.942
So were my folks.

251
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.612
That is, you're against it?

252
00:16:07.904 --> 00:16:10.113
Well, of course I'm against it.
What's the matter with you?


253
00:16:10.822 --> 00:16:12.699
Well, I just like to get it straight.
You see, sir,


254
00:16:13.283 --> 00:16:14.993
our organization agrees with you.

255
00:16:15.494 --> 00:16:19.206
We believe this ruling to be one of the greatest
wrongs the government's ever perpetrated.


256
00:16:19.372 --> 00:16:22.793
Yes, a shame all right,
but what can we do?

257
00:16:26.088 --> 00:16:27.089
Fight!

258
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.174
We did. We lost.

259
00:16:30.175 --> 00:16:31.468
It's a law now!

260
00:16:31.968 --> 00:16:33.178
Whose law?

261
00:16:34.347 --> 00:16:35.598
I thought this was a democracy

262
00:16:35.807 --> 00:16:38.893
and I thought a democracy was based
on the collective will of the people.


263
00:16:39.102 --> 00:16:40.645
Sure, of course, sure.

264
00:16:41.354 --> 00:16:43.439
And is it the
collective will of the people

265
00:16:44.023 --> 00:16:47.234
That negroes should be allowed to mix
with whites right under the same roof?


266
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:49.945
Study with them.
Eat with them.


267
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.404
Maybe even sleep with them?

268
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:56.493
Is it the collective will of the people, that niggers
should be allowed to take over the whole world?


269
00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:00.288
Because that's what's going to happen, Mr. Shipman.

270
00:17:02.707 --> 00:17:04.584
You think it can be stopped?

271
00:17:05.293 --> 00:17:06.878
With your help, I'm sure.

272
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.006
Legally?

273
00:17:10.967 --> 00:17:12.677
Start talking, my boy.

274
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:30.527
Hello, Uncle Roy.
Here's your tobacco.


275
00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:45.126
How many times you gonna iron that shirt?

276
00:17:45.626 --> 00:17:47.795
Well, you wanna look nice, don't you?

277
00:17:50.715 --> 00:17:55.094
Hey man, dig... 
Integration, black and white... 
How 'bout that?

278
00:17:55.595 --> 00:17:58.181
Why don't you shut up. 
And turn that junk off.

279
00:17:58.473 --> 00:18:00.766
What you talkin' about junk?
That's music, man.


280
00:18:01.475 --> 00:18:03.518
I said, turn it off.

281
00:18:03.852 --> 00:18:04.644
Joey...

282
00:18:05.062 --> 00:18:07.272
I'm sorry, Mom. 
I'm just bushed.

283
00:18:09.191 --> 00:18:11.526
Hey, you really gonna make him go
to the white school tomorrow?


284
00:18:12.277 --> 00:18:14.821
Why, I'm not making
him go, am I, Joey?

285
00:18:15.406 --> 00:18:16.449
No, ma.

286
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.577
Well, it's too bad I ain't old enough. 
I would't be scared, that's all.

287
00:18:19.952 --> 00:18:22.538
- Who's scared?
- You are!


288
00:18:22.622 --> 00:18:24.248
Man, do you know
what you ought to do?.

289
00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:27.502
I'll tell you what you ought to do.
Get yourself a gun...


290
00:18:28.628 --> 00:18:31.130
Play it cool, see? First grey stud looks at
you sideways...


291
00:18:41.098 --> 00:18:42.599
You're just talk.

292
00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:51.693
I don't think Daddy would approve of this
kind of thing going on.


293
00:18:58.074 --> 00:19:02.245
I know Mr. Shipman wouldn't approve
of this kind of thing going on in his car.


294
00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:26.769
- Good morning.
- Good Morning.


295
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.229
Would the children step forward, please.

296
00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:35.403
I'm not going to bore
you with a long sermon.

297
00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:38.865
I just want to let you know that I know
how you feel-- everyone of you.


298
00:19:39.073 --> 00:19:41.701
I know because I can
see it on your faces.

299
00:19:42.535 --> 00:19:43.411
Be strong, children!

300
00:19:44.912 --> 00:19:47.915
Not muscle and pride strong, man-strong.

301
00:19:48.124 --> 00:19:50.877
Let your strength be shown in meekness.

302
00:19:51.586 --> 00:19:52.294
When you win this fight.

303
00:19:52.461 --> 00:19:56.173
Not only for yourself,
but for all our people.


304
00:19:56.382 --> 00:19:57.216
Let us pray.

305
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.972
Lord, in thy mercy protect these 10 lambs.

306
00:20:04.182 --> 00:20:06.517
When they walk in
the valley of the shadow...

307
00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:08.519
Comfort them.

308
00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:11.898
And when they falter, give them strength.

309
00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:15.777
When they despair, give them hope.

310
00:20:16.986 --> 00:20:19.572
And let them do thy will.

311
00:20:19.989 --> 00:20:21.074
Amen.

312
00:20:43.721 --> 00:20:45.723
What'd you say, Uncle Roy?

313
00:20:46.432 --> 00:20:49.769
I said you negroes gonna cause some of us
niggers to get killed.


314
00:21:04.994 --> 00:21:06.869
God Almighty!

315
00:22:01.758 --> 00:22:03.760
Hey, Tom, come here.

316
00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:09.224
There's your invaders...

317
00:22:09.266 --> 00:22:10.768
Not much of an army, is it?

318
00:22:57.773 --> 00:22:59.941
Hey, niggers!
Why don't you go on home?


319
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:14.122
This is a white school!
For white people!


320
00:23:20.588 --> 00:23:23.132
What's the trouble here?
Well, just what do you think?


321
00:23:55.831 --> 00:23:57.833
I'll tell you something right here and now.

322
00:23:58.459 --> 00:24:02.004
It may be hot tonight, but it's gonna get hotter,
for a lot of people


323
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.089
This here little town is gonna burn.

324
00:24:05.216 --> 00:24:08.511
What I mean is that
it's gonna burn the conscience of the country


325
00:24:09.386 --> 00:24:13.515
and put forward a light
that everyone and everybody's gonna see and feel.


326
00:24:13.806 --> 00:24:15.975
This town I'm talking about!
Caxton!


327
00:24:21.482 --> 00:24:24.360
People... something happened today.

328
00:24:25.861 --> 00:24:30.658
Ten Negroes went into the Caxton high school
and sat with the white children there.


329
00:24:32.576 --> 00:24:33.953
Nobody stopped them.

330
00:24:34.537 --> 00:24:35.955
Nobody turned them out .

331
00:24:37.456 --> 00:24:39.625
And you know what they're saying that means?

332
00:24:42.753 --> 00:24:46.423
They're saying that you all don't give a darn whether
the whites mix with the blacks


333
00:24:46.507 --> 00:24:48.509
Because you didn't fight against it!

334
00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:52.262
Well, I say, how can somebody fight
what he doesn't see?


335
00:24:54.515 --> 00:24:56.725
They've kept the facts away from you.

336
00:24:57.393 --> 00:25:00.187
They've cheated and deceived...
everyone of you.


337
00:25:01.689 --> 00:25:04.900
They filled your heads with filthy lies.

338
00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:06.777
and kept you in the dark.

339
00:25:08.863 --> 00:25:10.865
So that when you finally do wake up

340
00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:16.662
Why, we're sorry,
but it's just too late


341
00:25:24.336 --> 00:25:30.967
Now I'm associated with the...
Patrick Henry Society.


342
00:25:31.427 --> 00:25:32.511
Which is an organization...

343
00:25:34.805 --> 00:25:36.182
dedicated to giving the people the truth.

344
00:25:36.807 --> 00:25:40.394
What I'm gonna tell you...
is gonna make your blood boil.


345
00:25:41.395 --> 00:25:44.773
Because I'm gonna show you that
the way this country is gonna go


346
00:25:47.318 --> 00:25:48.235
depends entirely

347
00:25:48.486 --> 00:25:52.323
and wholly and completely on you!

348
00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:03.376
Now, you all know,

349
00:26:04.543 --> 00:26:07.379
that there was peace and quiet,

350
00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:09.632
in the south.

351
00:26:10.633 --> 00:26:14.261
Before the NAACP started stirring up trouble.

352
00:26:16.555 --> 00:26:21.727
But what tou don't know is that this so-called
"advancement of colored people"


353
00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:30.111
is now , and has always been...
nothing but a communist front


354
00:26:30.402 --> 00:26:32.822
headed by a Jew who hates America...

355
00:26:33.114 --> 00:26:36.117
And doesn't make any bones about it, either.

356
00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:39.704
Well, the Commies didn't waste a second.

357
00:26:39.871 --> 00:26:41.997
They knew only too well, friends,

358
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.794
that the quicker way to cripple a country

359
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:48.879
is to mongrelize it.

360
00:26:51.173 --> 00:26:54.176
So they poured all the millions of dollars
the Jews could get for them


361
00:26:54.468 --> 00:26:56.554
Into this one thing:

362
00:26:57.054 --> 00:27:00.724
Desegregation.
They went to the courts.


363
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.145
Now Judge Silver...

364
00:27:06.147 --> 00:27:07.815
Who is  a Jew...

365
00:27:08.734 --> 00:27:11.319
and is known to have leftist leanings.

366
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.904
Who said so?

367
00:27:15.615 --> 00:27:17.409
The record says so. Look it up.

368
00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:23.080
Abraham Silver, for one thing, belongs
to the Quill and Pen society


369
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:26.792
which receives it's funds indirectly from Moscow.

370
00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:30.463
So what did the judge do?

371
00:27:31.881 --> 00:27:35.676
Went right ahead and ordered
integration for the Caxton high school.

372
00:27:37.386 --> 00:27:40.473
Your mayor and the governor...

373
00:27:40.849 --> 00:27:43.268
could have stopped it, but
they didn't have the guts!

374
00:27:48.648 --> 00:27:49.733
All right.

375
00:27:52.444 --> 00:27:53.820
Now you may think,

376
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:55.822
the problem...

377
00:27:56.447 --> 00:27:59.533
Is simply whether we're going to allow
ten Negroes to go to our schools.


378
00:28:00.117 --> 00:28:01.619
That's only a small part

379
00:28:02.203 --> 00:28:03.829
I'm in a position to know...

380
00:28:05.206 --> 00:28:07.583
Because the Patrick Henry society...

381
00:28:08.084 --> 00:28:10.378
had studied the whole thing.

382
00:28:10.586 --> 00:28:12.380
The real problem,
whether you like it or not.


383
00:28:12.588 --> 00:28:14.590
is whether you're gonna sit back

384
00:28:16.176 --> 00:28:19.388
and let desegregation spread throughout the
entire South.


385
00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:21.473
And it's an indisuptable fact...

386
00:28:21.765 --> 00:28:23.183
That there could be no other result!

387
00:28:23.683 --> 00:28:27.562
The Negroes will literally
and I do mean literally...


388
00:28:27.979 --> 00:28:29.773
control the South!

389
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.274
The votes will be theirs!

390
00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.527
You'll have black mayors and black policemen

391
00:28:34.944 --> 00:28:36.862
the way they do in
Chicago and New York already!

392
00:28:37.446 --> 00:28:38.739
Like as not a black governor?

393
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:41.325
And black doctors to deliver your babies?

394
00:28:41.617 --> 00:28:43.911
If they find time that is.

395
00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.914
And that's the way it'll be!

396
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.294
Did you ever stop to think about that

397
00:28:52.004 --> 00:28:54.798
When you let those ten
into your school, did you?

398
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.098
Now, let me ask you,

399
00:29:04.683 --> 00:29:06.768
Do you people want niggers taking over?

400
00:29:11.063 --> 00:29:13.149
And are you willing to fight
this thing down to the last ditch

401
00:29:13.274 --> 00:29:15.776
And keep fighting until it's over?

402
00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:21.741
And I'm willing to fight with you.

403
00:29:22.242 --> 00:29:23.452
Why, Mr. Cramer?

404
00:29:27.622 --> 00:29:28.332
Why?

405
00:29:32.544 --> 00:29:35.005
Because I'm an American, sir,
and I love my country.

406
00:29:36.423 --> 00:29:39.301
and I'm willing to give
my life, if that be necessary,

407
00:29:40.719 --> 00:29:43.513
to see that my country
stays free!


408
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:45.891
White!

409
00:29:46.516 --> 00:29:47.808
And American!

410
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.293
Hey, look at that!

411
00:31:01.423 --> 00:31:01.673
- What is that?
- I don't know.


412
00:31:02.718 --> 00:31:04.928
- Danian, what is it?
- I don't know.


413
00:31:06.759 --> 00:31:07.677
Come on! Let's get them!

414
00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:09.468
Let's get out of here, quick!

415
00:31:13.512 --> 00:31:15.188
Take it easy, nigger. 
You're not going anywhere.

416
00:31:15.314 --> 00:31:17.608
Are you looking for trouble?

417
00:31:17.816 --> 00:31:19.192
No, sir we're on our
way to our  house.

418
00:31:20.485 --> 00:31:21.903
Please don't do it. 
We have't done anything.

419
00:31:22.112 --> 00:31:23.905
Who gave you permission to ride through
Claxon, nigger?


420
00:31:24.197 --> 00:31:26.241
Do not you know that
this is reserved for whites?

421
00:31:28.076 --> 00:31:29.953
We haven't do anything!

422
00:31:29.995 --> 00:31:31.079
You're dirtying up our streets!

423
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.248
Look at them darkies in the back!

424
00:31:34.083 --> 00:31:35.877
Danian, please.

425
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.170
Please.

426
00:31:38.171 --> 00:31:39.463
Please.

427
00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.635
All right, I'm sorry.
We're going.


428
00:31:46.844 --> 00:31:49.221
That's what you say,
but I think you're lying, nigger!


429
00:31:49.761 --> 00:31:51.522
I don't like to nobody!

430
00:31:54.758 --> 00:31:56.311
You talk back to me, nigger?

431
00:31:56.312 --> 00:31:57.438
Come on, let's go...

432
00:31:59.024 --> 00:32:01.026
- Come on, kill yourself.
Take one step, one move


433
00:32:15.666 --> 00:32:16.167
Why?

434
00:32:18.757 --> 00:32:20.045
All right.Break it up!

435
00:32:22.172 --> 00:32:22.631
Who says?

436
00:32:22.881 --> 00:32:24.549
I say your miserable little toad!

437
00:32:25.342 --> 00:32:29.012
Now if the rest of you people don't want to spend this
night in jail, get out of here.


438
00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:29.513
Now!

439
00:32:29.721 --> 00:32:31.848
Get in the car and get out of here
as fast as you can.


440
00:32:34.142 --> 00:32:35.561
All right, all right, what's going on here?

441
00:32:36.228 --> 00:32:39.815
Oh, nothing, sheriff, the good citizens
was just having a little fun, that's all


442
00:32:40.942 --> 00:32:42.026
What kind of fun?

443
00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:43.528
Best kind.

444
00:32:44.112 --> 00:32:47.615
- Attacking Negroes.
He's lying, Sheriff, we didn't attack anybody.


445
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.619
There seems to be
a difference of opinion here.

446
00:32:52.828 --> 00:32:54.287
Opinions got nothing to do with it, Sheriff.

447
00:32:53.912 --> 00:32:57.666
The fact is a family was
terrorized on the streets of Caxton

448
00:32:58.135 --> 00:32:59.983
What the hell, it was
just a bunch of coons, Sheriff!

449
00:33:02.296 --> 00:33:04.089
Who did this here terrorizing?

450
00:33:08.552 --> 00:33:10.345
Do you want me to arrest everybody, Tom?

451
00:33:15.351 --> 00:33:17.145
All right, it's all over, let's go home!

452
00:33:23.943 --> 00:33:27.113
Last night, the law was broken.

453
00:33:27.363 --> 00:33:28.740
A young northerner named Adam Cramer

454
00:33:28.948 --> 00:33:31.700
delivered an inflammatory speech on
the steps of the County Couthouse..


455
00:33:34.036 --> 00:33:35.871
Hi Tom, how you makin' it, boy?

456
00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:37.122
- Hello Vern, you met eh...?

457
00:33:37.414 --> 00:33:40.125
YES, I've had the pleasure...
-How are you?


458
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.091
- What do you want? 
Nothing, just a little order of business.

459
00:33:48.384 --> 00:33:49.594
You do run ads, don't you?

460
00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:51.095
If they meet our standards.

461
00:33:51.304 --> 00:33:55.266
By God, Tom, you're still the crankiest man
of a morning I ever did see.


462
00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:59.062
-Well, sir?
Doesn't meet our standards.


463
00:33:59.354 --> 00:34:02.065
-I'd suggest that you...
I'd suggest you get hell out of this office, Cramer.


464
00:34:02.857 --> 00:34:04.359
No, no, it's all right, Vern...

465
00:34:05.568 --> 00:34:08.238
Mr. McDaniel is upset about what happened last night
and he holds me responsible.


466
00:34:08.445 --> 00:34:10.155
You are responsible!

467
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:12.241
I'm sorry you feel
that way about it, sir.

468
00:34:13.033 --> 00:34:14.743
Because you and I are
fighting on the same side.

469
00:34:16.245 --> 00:34:17.538
I'll meet you later, Vern.

470
00:34:21.209 --> 00:34:22.627
He's taken you in, has he?

471
00:34:24.504 --> 00:34:27.924
Now look, Tom, Cramer may be young and he maybe an outsider
and all of that, but...


472
00:34:28.508 --> 00:34:31.511
by damn you gotta admit he's
on the right track.


473
00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.263
You heard his speech last night?

474
00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:34.305
Yes, I heard it

475
00:34:34.597 --> 00:34:36.307
I saw what happened afterwards, too.

476
00:34:36.891 --> 00:34:39.602
Don't prove a thing, probably that
there nigra was uppity.


477
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.063
That Negro wasn't uppity.

478
00:34:42.272 --> 00:34:44.482
He was just passing through town.
which is his legal right.


479
00:34:46.275 --> 00:34:48.777
Oh now, come on. Tom, come on.

480
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:52.865
You just mad because it took somebody from out
of town to show us how we been falling down on our job.


481
00:34:53.073 --> 00:34:55.450
Well, I was mad in the beginning, too.

482
00:34:55.743 --> 00:34:59.038
But there's no two ways about it.
This here thing has gotta be stopped.


483
00:34:59.455 --> 00:35:01.332
And it's gotta be stopped right now.

484
00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:04.836
How? By attacking Negroes in the streets?

485
00:35:05.128 --> 00:35:07.005
If that's what it takes, yes.

486
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.926
Vern, do you know what you're saying?

487
00:35:12.135 --> 00:35:15.221
YES, I know what I 'm saying-
but I don't think you do.


488
00:35:15.805 --> 00:35:19.893
I'm saying that we fought this thing fair and above
board and it didn't get us anywhere.


489
00:35:20.185 --> 00:35:21.978
Now we're gonna have
to fight it their way.

490
00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:24.396
There's nothing to fight anymore, Vern.

491
00:35:25.272 --> 00:35:27.649
Law says we got to have integration.

492
00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:29.777
I believe in obeying the law.

493
00:35:30.278 --> 00:35:31.988
Cramer apparently doesn't.

494
00:35:32.572 --> 00:35:35.366
I don't like him.
I don't trust him.


495
00:35:36.451 --> 00:35:38.870
And I'm certainly not
gonna run his stinking ad!

496
00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:41.748
Doggone...

497
00:35:41.956 --> 00:35:44.918
Ain't you forgetting something, Tom?

498
00:35:45.126 --> 00:35:46.044
What's that?

499
00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:47.921
Why, I own the
controlling stock in the Messenger.

500
00:35:49.255 --> 00:35:50.632
You're working for me.

501
00:35:52.342 --> 00:35:53.510
That's the way it is?

502
00:35:54.928 --> 00:35:56.304
That's the way it is. Doggone it.

503
00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.886
Who is it?

504
00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:43.555
Adam Cramer, your neighbor.

505
00:38:45.682 --> 00:38:47.559
What do you want?

506
00:38:48.769 --> 00:38:50.938
A cup of coffee and a little
conversation, maybe.


507
00:38:52.773 --> 00:38:53.733
Just a minute.

508
00:38:57.862 --> 00:38:58.654
Hi.

509
00:38:59.655 --> 00:39:00.656
Hello.

510
00:39:00.948 --> 00:39:02.616
Sam said I should drop in on you.

511
00:39:03.951 --> 00:39:06.745
That he was spending the night in Faragot,
thought maybe you could use a little company.


512
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:10.623
But if not
I'll go back to my room.


513
00:39:11.499 --> 00:39:13.418
I think that'd be a pretty good idea.

514
00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.420
Is that what you
want  me to do?

515
00:39:16.212 --> 00:39:17.297
Yes

516
00:39:17.714 --> 00:39:18.798
Why?

517
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.885
Well look, I'm getting ready to bed... I...

518
00:39:22.094 --> 00:39:24.096
At 10:15?
I thought you were a night owl.


519
00:39:24.472 --> 00:39:25.473
Please!

520
00:39:27.266 --> 00:39:31.187
Oh, come one. Sam would be very put out with you if he
heard that you weren't hospitable to a friend.


521
00:39:33.272 --> 00:39:34.982
I don't consider you a friend, Mr. Cramer.

522
00:39:35.066 --> 00:39:37.360
Unkind.
Definitely unkind.


523
00:39:38.277 --> 00:39:39.528
I just want a
little ole cup of coffee.

524
00:39:42.865 --> 00:39:43.657
Ok.

525
00:39:53.416 --> 00:39:54.793
Why'd you say that?

526
00:39:54.835 --> 00:39:55.836
Say what?

527
00:39:58.506 --> 00:40:00.299
Taht I wasn't a friend.

528
00:40:02.426 --> 00:40:06.305
I don't know. I'm tired.
It's hot. I told you.


529
00:40:06.889 --> 00:40:08.808
The way you act,
you're not afraid of me, are you?


530
00:40:11.102 --> 00:40:11.769
No.

531
00:40:12.687 --> 00:40:14.563
Don't have to bite my head off.

532
00:40:20.653 --> 00:40:22.445
How do you stand it, anyway?

533
00:40:22.779 --> 00:40:24.280
I don't know what you're talking about.

534
00:40:24.447 --> 00:40:26.074
Well, you know, this town...

535
00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:28.660
I should think you get awfully lonely...

536
00:40:28.953 --> 00:40:31.038
Especially with Sam leaving you half the time.

537
00:40:35.418 --> 00:40:37.253
I stand it just fine, Mr. Cramer.

538
00:40:38.337 --> 00:40:41.007
Where you born with that chip on your shoulder
Or did somebody put it there?


539
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:45.219
Look, if you don't like my personality,
you don't have to subject yourself to it.


540
00:40:45.928 --> 00:40:47.305
What are you after, anyway?

541
00:40:48.514 --> 00:40:50.016
A cup of coffee.

542
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.895
Afterwards you have to go.

543
00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:28.346
-Oh, thank you.
Mr. Cramer, I didn't know you were... a religious man.


544
00:41:28.638 --> 00:41:30.014
You have to admit, it's dramatic.

545
00:41:30.723 --> 00:41:32.099
Mmm-hmm. So is a lynching.

546
00:41:33.434 --> 00:41:35.102
That's old fashioned.

547
00:41:35.728 --> 00:41:37.188
Otherwise you wouldn't mind?

548
00:41:38.105 --> 00:41:40.191
Mrs. Griffin, that's a terrible thing to say.

549
00:41:41.817 --> 00:41:42.985
These people like me.

550
00:41:44.195 --> 00:41:45.988
I'm here to save
lives not to take them.

551
00:41:47.281 --> 00:41:48.783
And I'm the Empress of China!

552
00:41:54.872 --> 00:41:57.875
I know what you're doing here,
but why.


553
00:41:58.167 --> 00:42:00.544
Who can say?
Great times call for great men.


554
00:42:03.756 --> 00:42:05.466
You're a great man?

555
00:42:06.133 --> 00:42:07.343
Not yet.

556
00:42:11.932 --> 00:42:13.849
You don't want to talk politics, do you?

557
00:42:16.143 --> 00:42:18.229
I've already told you all you need to
know about me.


558
00:42:20.731 --> 00:42:23.025
You despise me, but you're attracted to
me, isn't that right?


559
00:42:26.487 --> 00:42:27.822
Isn't it?

560
00:42:31.075 --> 00:42:33.869
If you don't mind I'll take off my coat,
it's getting awfully hot in here.


561
00:42:36.872 --> 00:42:38.374
Aren't you hot?

562
00:42:41.294 --> 00:42:43.880
I hope you know these bulbs
are giving off a lot of heat.

563
00:42:44.756 --> 00:42:45.966
Look at the difference.

564
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.136
See?

565
00:42:51.554 --> 00:42:53.431
Hoo-wee! We're down 5 degrees, I'll bet.

566
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.353
You're not very comfortable, are you?

567
00:43:03.608 --> 00:43:05.735
It does get lonely for you,
doesn't it, Vi?


568
00:43:06.736 --> 00:43:09.697
I know it does. I feel that way myself
a lot of the times.


569
00:43:11.699 --> 00:43:13.326
- I almost go crazy sometimes.

570
00:43:13.492 --> 00:43:15.995
Because there isn't anybody who feels things
the way that I do.


571
00:43:18.207 --> 00:43:21.501
I think how wonderful it'd be to
meet a person...


572
00:43:22.502 --> 00:43:24.880
like that and be with that person.

573
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.091
Not for long, just a little while.

574
00:43:29.884 --> 00:43:31.636
Just a little while...

575
00:43:31.677 --> 00:43:32.678
Adam, no.

576
00:43:33.346 --> 00:43:34.722
Adam, please.

577
00:43:34.764 --> 00:43:35.765
Please, please what?

578
00:43:36.474 --> 00:43:37.558
You want me to leave?

579
00:43:38.935 --> 00:43:39.769
-You want me to leave? 
You want me to l...

580
00:43:41.229 --> 00:43:43.439
Oh you want it,
you know you want it.?

581
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.828
Well, that settles it.

582
00:43:57.913 --> 00:43:59.998
We're taking Ella out of school tomorrow.

583
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.794
We're doing nothing of the kind.

584
00:44:05.002 --> 00:44:06.796
Why, Tom, what's got in to you?

585
00:44:07.505 --> 00:44:09.590
I don't know what you're thinking anymore.

586
00:44:10.007 --> 00:44:11.467
I 'm not sure, either.

587
00:44:12.593 --> 00:44:13.970
Ruth, tell me something.

588
00:44:14.178 --> 00:44:16.180
How do you feel about this question?

589
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:20.101
Well, I 'm not sure
I know what you mean.

590
00:44:20.351 --> 00:44:21.561
About integration.

591
00:44:23.438 --> 00:44:25.149
Why, I think it's a terrible thing.

592
00:44:25.149 --> 00:44:26.150
Why?

593
00:44:27.151 --> 00:44:28.152
Why?

594
00:44:29.528 --> 00:44:31.947
Because it just isn't right, that's why.

595
00:44:35.951 --> 00:44:37.911
Tom, are you in favor of it?

596
00:44:41.539 --> 00:44:42.623
Yes.

597
00:44:43.916 --> 00:44:45.793
-Well why didn't you...
-Because I didn't know.


598
00:44:47.128 --> 00:44:49.088
I don't think I knew really until now.

599
00:44:51.215 --> 00:44:52.884
One thing Adam Cramer has done for us...

600
00:44:53.801 --> 00:44:55.970
he's made us face ourselves.

601
00:44:56.096 --> 00:44:57.890
Well, what are you going to do?

602
00:44:58.891 --> 00:44:59.766
I don't know.

603
00:45:04.688 --> 00:45:07.774
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure of anything.


604
00:45:09.443 --> 00:45:11.069
Except this is right...

605
00:45:12.154 --> 00:45:14.156
And we're got to face up to it.

606
00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:04.957
Why'd you pull him in for, Rudy?

607
00:46:05.457 --> 00:46:08.127
He smarted off at me, daring me
to take him to jail.


608
00:46:08.752 --> 00:46:11.630
Yeah, but you know he didn't have anything to
do with that bombing.


609
00:46:12.131 --> 00:46:14.716
Maybe you know... I don't.

610
00:46:19.096 --> 00:46:20.305
How are you, Vern?

611
00:46:20.806 --> 00:46:23.725
I might as well tell you right off the bat
I don't cotton to any of this.


612
00:46:23.892 --> 00:46:25.811
I strung along with you because
I figured you were smart,


613
00:46:26.019 --> 00:46:27.104
but smart people don't end up here.

614
00:46:27.312 --> 00:46:30.482
Oh, I'm not ending up here, Vern.
This is just the beginning.


615
00:46:32.484 --> 00:46:34.986
Never underestimate the value of a jail sentence.

616
00:46:35.696 --> 00:46:38.866
Remember Socrates,
Lenin, Hitler...


617
00:46:40.784 --> 00:46:43.579
The bail is $ 10,000,
what if I don't put up the money?


618
00:46:45.372 --> 00:46:47.541
Forget it, Very. 
I don't want your money, yet.

619
00:46:48.959 --> 00:46:50.043
Haven't I told you that?

620
00:46:52.254 --> 00:46:53.547
Where you gonna get it?

621
00:47:12.608 --> 00:47:13.817
Thank you, thank you very much.
I want to thank the Rev. Neeson,


622
00:47:13.901 --> 00:47:17.488
and Mr. Carey and Mr. Donogan,
for what they done for me.


623
00:47:18.197 --> 00:47:20.532
Our friend, Vern
Shipman offered to get me out of jail,


624
00:47:20.866 --> 00:47:21.992
But I told him no.

625
00:47:23.368 --> 00:47:24.495
I told him...

626
00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:27.456
Lookie here, the people... will see to it.

627
00:47:32.961 --> 00:47:34.838
Now listen, he's a good
man, but he didn't believe me.

628
00:47:36.256 --> 00:47:37.966
I want you to know, 
I'm mighty glad

629
00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.135
to show him I was right.

630
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.055
He knows for sure
now, the people of Caxton

631
00:47:43.348 --> 00:47:45.225
won't stand still for no injustice.

632
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:55.818
What the Sheriff thought was that I was responsible
for the dynamiting up in the Badlands.


633
00:47:56.026 --> 00:48:02.991
Why I couldn't believe he was serious. 
I said to him...

634
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.911
"Sheriff, whoever planted that bomb, it wasn't nobody
in the Patrick Henry Society.


635
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:08.122
We got brains enough to know...

636
00:48:08.789 --> 00:48:11.125
That killing a nigger preacher
and blowing up a church...


637
00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:12.793
wouldn't do us nothing but harm.

638
00:48:13.085 --> 00:48:14.962
Throwing a scare into the niggers is good,

639
00:48:16.089 --> 00:48:20.176
But  we got to be very,
very careful.


640
00:48:20.677 --> 00:48:22.137
- Right?
- Yeah, that's right.


641
00:48:23.138 --> 00:48:24.764
Now I ain't condemning anybody.

642
00:48:26.557 --> 00:48:29.560
Whoever planted that bomb was doing
what he thought was right.


643
00:48:32.229 --> 00:48:33.731
But he was wrong.

644
00:48:35.733 --> 00:48:37.818
I hope you all see
that now and go about acting

645
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.320
according to the rules of society.

646
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:45.367
Well, I don't know anything about
that, but I know one thing.

647
00:48:45.576 --> 00:48:47.119
Ain't gonna be one solitary nigger

648
00:48:47.286 --> 00:48:49.079
to have enough guts to
step into our school now.

649
00:48:49.914 --> 00:48:51.207
It's all over!

650
00:49:16.857 --> 00:49:18.150
Hello, Adam.

651
00:49:19.318 --> 00:49:21.737
Sam, how are things?

652
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:24.324
- Ok , I guess.
-Good.


653
00:49:25.116 --> 00:49:29.412
How'd you do in Faragut?
Sell 'em any... what is it... pens?


654
00:49:30.622 --> 00:49:32.791
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

655
00:49:35.001 --> 00:49:37.712
Is there something you want to see me about, Sam?
Tell you the truth, I'm kind of pooped... I thought maybe...


656
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.799
Look, Adam, I know this ain't none of your business
and I got no right bothering you with it,


657
00:49:42.007 --> 00:49:43.884
But I've got to talk to somebody about it,
I just got to. I'll go crazy if I don't.


658
00:49:44.593 --> 00:49:46.512
What is it, Sam? 
What's the matter?

659
00:49:47.054 --> 00:49:47.638
She's gone!

660
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:50.808
- Who?
- Vi! She's gone, left me. run out!


661
00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:52.685
What happened?

662
00:49:52.893 --> 00:49:54.186
I don't know.

663
00:49:54.395 --> 00:49:59.024
I got back from Faragut about 2 o'clock,
with a present for her.


664
00:49:59.693 --> 00:50:01.486
I got up to the room;
she was gone.


665
00:50:01.653 --> 00:50:03.530
Just a note saying she loved me but was no good for me
I should forget her.


666
00:50:04.656 --> 00:50:06.449
Oh, I'm really very, very sorry.

667
00:50:07.742 --> 00:50:09.744
Do you have any idea why
she'd do a thing like that?

668
00:50:10.912 --> 00:50:12.706
Yeah, I think maybe I
can guess part of the reason.

669
00:50:14.833 --> 00:50:16.501
I never told anyone this...

670
00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:18.419
But I consider you a friend, Adam.

671
00:50:19.628 --> 00:50:22.506
Before I met Vi, she... well she
knew a lot of men.


672
00:50:22.715 --> 00:50:24.758
it was like a disease with her.

673
00:50:24.925 --> 00:50:26.593
Doctors got a name for it,
but they can't cure it alone.


674
00:50:27.886 --> 00:50:29.805
When I met Vi, I fell in love with her
I knew she was a good woman


675
00:50:30.307 --> 00:50:31.933
I thought maybe I could help her,

676
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.560
Five years we've been happy.

677
00:50:34.394 --> 00:50:37.856
Now this...
I figure she got in some trouble.


678
00:50:38.857 --> 00:50:40.150
What sort of trouble?

679
00:50:40.358 --> 00:50:41.443
Man trouble.

680
00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:45.488
Might be some fella come along,
caught her at a weak moment... she...


681
00:50:47.574 --> 00:50:48.783
What do you think, Adam?
You think that could be it?


682
00:50:51.453 --> 00:50:53.455
Well... it's possible, 
I guess, but I...

683
00:50:55.039 --> 00:50:57.833
just can't bring myself to believe it.
Mrs. Griffin, she doesn't seem the type, you know what I mean?


684
00:50:58.125 --> 00:50:59.418
It was a man.
But who?


685
00:51:00.753 --> 00:51:01.629
You!

686
00:51:07.761 --> 00:51:09.721
-Oh, Sam...
-Don't bother thinking up a lot of lies. I know what happened.


687
00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:11.765
This is an old hotel, the walls are thin...
Mrs. Lambert heard you!


688
00:51:12.641 --> 00:51:13.683
I wasn't gonna deny it, Sam.

689
00:51:17.312 --> 00:51:18.980
The reason I didn't tell
you before was... was because...

690
00:51:19.898 --> 00:51:22.776
I didn't want to hurt you
anymore than you've been hurt already.

691
00:51:22.776 --> 00:51:23.777
Really, honest, that's the truth.

692
00:51:24.277 --> 00:51:27.280
Blame me if you want to,
But Sam, I'm going to level with you...


693
00:51:29.157 --> 00:51:31.201
It was a lot my fault, no sure, 
I won't pretend it wasn't.

694
00:51:32.868 --> 00:51:34.453
I went to your room, just to say good night,
and we were talking, just talking...


695
00:51:35.997 --> 00:51:39.042
And I don't know, suddenly everything
started to go wrong!


696
00:51:39.251 --> 00:51:40.585
- Can you understand?
- I understand.


697
00:51:42.045 --> 00:51:44.256
So... so I slept with
her. Okay, I admit it,

698
00:51:44.923 --> 00:51:46.424
but you've got to know this.

699
00:51:46.925 --> 00:51:49.219
No matter how much you
blame me and hate me...

700
00:51:49.511 --> 00:51:50.929
And, and, and want to shoot me

701
00:51:51.012 --> 00:51:53.473
It wasn't all my fault!
And there's another thing,


702
00:51:55.725 --> 00:51:57.727
Mrs. Griffin said I was't the first.

703
00:51:58.103 --> 00:52:00.313
I mean, since you've been married, she's slept
with plenty of others.


704
00:52:00.605 --> 00:52:03.608
And she said she knew it didn't matter because
you'd never catch on.


705
00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.611
Sam, I'm forcing myself to tell you this...
it's the truth!


706
00:52:06.903 --> 00:52:08.071
Liar!

707
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:12.075
Listen to me, Sam. 
I'm telling the truth. 
I'm not lying.

708
00:52:14.869 --> 00:52:16.580
You missed your calling, boy

709
00:52:16.788 --> 00:52:20.375
You'd have made a fine push man, you know just
how to work on peoples' weak spots.


710
00:52:21.042 --> 00:52:22.252
But you know something?

711
00:52:22.752 --> 00:52:26.631
I'm gonna find her and I'm gonna get her back
and when I do we'll be closer than ever.


712
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.427
So in a way, you've really
done us a big favor... friend.

713
00:52:39.603 --> 00:52:40.812
You know something?

714
00:52:41.021 --> 00:52:42.814
We're in the same line, you and me.

715
00:52:43.399 --> 00:52:45.026
We're both selling something.

716
00:52:45.526 --> 00:52:47.861
But I've been at it longer, I can
see where you're making mistakes.


717
00:52:48.194 --> 00:52:49.988
And right now those mistakes are beginning
to pile up on you


718
00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.782
and in a little
while they're gonna smother you.

719
00:52:55.202 --> 00:52:57.495
-Get outta here.
I've been studying your pitch, it's not bad, you've got technique,


720
00:52:57.662 --> 00:52:58.371
but you know what's wrong?

721
00:52:59.581 --> 00:53:02.959
You're too clever, Adam.
You got no room in your head for intelligence.


722
00:53:03.752 --> 00:53:07.380
But if you were intelligent, you'd be able to see
that you started something you can't control.


723
00:53:07.422 --> 00:53:08.632
You think you're the boss now?

724
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:11.551
Wake up, boy, that mob's the boss.

725
00:53:12.052 --> 00:53:13.929
What do you know, you big boob?

726
00:53:14.638 --> 00:53:16.723
Did you tell them
to blow up the church?

727
00:53:33.198 --> 00:53:35.116
I'm sick of listening to you rave, now

728
00:53:35.492 --> 00:53:36.493
get out of here
before I pull the trigger.

729
00:53:39.496 --> 00:53:44.292
Oh, people are wonderful! You couldn't pull that trigger
if your life depended on it!


730
00:53:45.877 --> 00:53:49.673
'Cause deep down inside, you're gutless, Adam.
You know you're a gutless.


731
00:53:49.757 --> 00:53:52.468
That's what you're doing this:
To prove to yourself that you're not.


732
00:53:55.346 --> 00:53:56.848
I'll give you 5...

733
00:53:57.473 --> 00:53:59.267
...if you're not out of here by then
I'll pull the trigger.


734
00:54:01.142 --> 00:54:01.935
One.

735
00:54:03.353 --> 00:54:04.062
Two.

736
00:54:06.648 --> 00:54:08.149
Three.

737
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.612
Four.

738
00:54:14.823 --> 00:54:16.324
Five.

739
00:54:16.825 --> 00:54:18.410
See what I mean, boy?

740
00:54:21.997 --> 00:54:24.082
Course you never wanna be
too sure of anything, either.

741
00:54:24.792 --> 00:54:26.210
Rule of the trade.

742
00:54:36.304 --> 00:54:38.388
Get away from me.

743
00:54:40.265 --> 00:54:42.100
No, boy, I don't think I'll do that.

744
00:54:42.476 --> 00:54:43.643
I think I'll stick around for a while.

745
00:54:44.644 --> 00:54:46.354
You won't see me,
likely, but I'll be here.

746
00:54:46.938 --> 00:54:48.857
I've always did like fireworks.

747
00:55:19.679 --> 00:55:21.556
- Ms. Green?
- That's right.


748
00:55:21.598 --> 00:55:25.060
My name is McDaniel,
I think we met once, I'm the editor of the newspaper...


749
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.062
You come here to gloat, Mister?

750
00:55:27.187 --> 00:55:28.980
Get on back to town and
put it in the paper.


751
00:55:29.357 --> 00:55:31.567
Us niggers give up--you won't
have to kill anymore of us.


752
00:55:31.776 --> 00:55:33.069
-Pop!
-Mr. Green,


753
00:55:33.736 --> 00:55:36.739
I know you have no reason to trust me,
and I have no right to expect you to...


754
00:55:37.532 --> 00:55:39.951
but I'm on your side.
- Yeah...


755
00:55:40.243 --> 00:55:41.202
Please... Please believe me.

756
00:55:42.328 --> 00:55:45.123
I understand how you feel,
I know it's hard.


757
00:55:45.498 --> 00:55:47.583
And I can't promise you
that nobody else will get hurt.

758
00:55:48.042 --> 00:55:49.043
Maybe they will. I don't know.

759
00:55:50.419 --> 00:55:51.629
But you mustn't give up now.

760
00:55:52.295 --> 00:55:56.299
Your boy and the other children have gotta go to
school this morning. Means everything.


761
00:55:56.633 --> 00:55:58.885
That's easy to say, but what have you got
to lose, white man?


762
00:56:00.512 --> 00:56:03.974
My job, my home, maybe my family.

763
00:56:04.308 --> 00:56:05.393
Is that enough for you?

764
00:56:08.563 --> 00:56:08.896
Joey...

765
00:56:09.063 --> 00:56:11.691
Don't try to stop me, Pop,
you know he's right, and so do I.


766
00:56:12.567 --> 00:56:14.152
We can't give up now.

767
00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:16.529
We'd better hurry.

768
00:57:11.959 --> 00:57:14.545
This'll be okay. Thank you very much.
Come on.


769
00:57:42.699 --> 00:57:44.200
-McDaniel-- -Yes -
You got anything to say?
- About what?


770
00:57:44.367 --> 00:57:47.662
We seen you, McDaniel, and
we want an explanation.


771
00:57:48.287 --> 00:57:49.789
Well, we're waiting.

772
00:57:50.081 --> 00:57:51.749
Please, get out of my way.

773
00:57:54.752 --> 00:57:58.548
- Hold it! -What do you want?
- Like the man said, an explanation.


774
00:57:59.257 --> 00:58:03.052
Yeah, you tell us McDaniel. How come you
walked that bunch of black niggers to our white school?


775
00:58:03.928 --> 00:58:05.847
I don't see that anything I
do is any business of yours.

776
00:58:06.514 --> 00:58:07.974
Figured you was against all this,

777
00:58:08.224 --> 00:58:10.017
And we seen you
taking them jigs to school,

778
00:58:10.435 --> 00:58:12.437
We were kind of a surprise, see?

779
00:58:12.812 --> 00:58:14.230
That's why we figure you
ought to do some talking.

780
00:58:14.605 --> 00:58:16.315
Yeah, whatta you got
to say for yourself now?

781
00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.402
Which one of them niggers paid you off?

782
00:58:20.487 --> 00:58:22.405
It ain't polite not
to answer a civil question.

783
00:58:23.281 --> 00:58:25.992
Now Abner here wants to know who paid
you to betray your people.


784
00:58:26.576 --> 00:58:28.286
Yeah, let's teach him a lesson now!

785
00:58:34.459 --> 00:58:36.753
Why don't you get 15
or 20 more people, Carey?

786
00:58:37.754 --> 00:58:39.172
Then you'll feel really safe.
Teach him, Bart!


787
00:58:39.964 --> 00:58:41.090
Shut your mouth, nigger lover!

788
00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.260
You're awful good with the questions,
how are you with the answers?


789
00:58:44.469 --> 00:58:45.345
Where were you
when that preacher was killed, Carey?


790
00:58:45.345 --> 00:58:47.555
Shut up or you're
gonna get the same thing!

791
00:58:47.764 --> 00:58:48.639
Where were you?

792
00:58:53.771 --> 00:58:56.273
Kill him, kill him!

793
00:59:11.996 --> 00:59:13.373
I'm sorry, honey.

794
00:59:14.874 --> 00:59:17.293
I guess I just wasn't
cut out to be a hero.

795
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:22.965
Am I gonna lose the eye?

796
00:59:26.387 --> 00:59:28.555
No, don't... don't get them yet.

797
00:59:30.474 --> 00:59:31.850
I want to know.

798
00:59:36.646 --> 00:59:38.648
You've already lost it, Tom.

799
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.822
They did a good job, didn't they?

800
00:59:48.199 --> 00:59:49.033
Father!

801
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:57.083
I'm all right.

802
00:59:57.084 --> 00:59:58.085
It's all right.

803
01:00:00.796 --> 01:00:02.631
You'd better go home sweetie, it's late.

804
01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.680
We musn't upset your father. 
He's gonna be all right.

805
01:00:13.683 --> 01:00:15.268
I'll be along in a little while.

806
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:22.817
I'm sorry, honey.

807
01:00:24.611 --> 01:00:25.612
Don't be.

808
01:00:29.115 --> 01:00:30.116
I'm not. Not in the least.

809
01:00:32.536 --> 01:00:35.414
It's the best thing you've ever
done and I'm proud of you.

810
01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:40.502
I wish I could tell you that I know why
you did what you did.


811
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:44.923
And why you fell the way you do, but...
I can't lie to you, Tom.


812
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:50.929
I don't believe in integration.

813
01:00:52.722 --> 01:00:54.390
But I believe in you.

814
01:00:56.017 --> 01:00:59.896
And if this means so much to you
that you're willing to risk everything


815
01:01:00.563 --> 01:01:03.358
Even your own life for it, then I
know it must be right.


816
01:01:06.528 --> 01:01:08.614
So I'm going to try and understand.

817
01:01:09.531 --> 01:01:11.867
I'm gonna try very hard, darling.

818
01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.996
I only ask you to
give me a little time.

819
01:01:18.249 --> 01:01:19.416
I love you, honey.

820
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.837
Tell me it's not to late for us.

821
01:01:24.797 --> 01:01:25.839
It isn't.

822
01:01:26.799 --> 01:01:28.424
It never is.

823
01:01:32.804 --> 01:01:34.222
May... Maybe you'd better get the doctor now.

824
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:46.710
Well, how is he?

825
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:51.711
Dammit, you going deaf? 
I asked you a question!

826
01:01:52.712 --> 01:01:53.712
Well?

827
01:01:55.356 --> 01:01:56.941
He has four ribs broken and...
And what?


828
01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.696
Internal injuries and...
he lost his eye.


829
01:02:02.572 --> 01:02:03.698
- He was lucky.
- Luck?


830
01:02:04.656 --> 01:02:06.950
Yes, in my day, they'd a strung
of man up for doing what he done.

831
01:02:07.159 --> 01:02:08.952
And I'd of been on
the end of the rope, too.

832
01:02:09.161 --> 01:02:10.746
What's the matter with him, anyhow?

833
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:15.585
How'm I gonna face my friends?
I've never been so embarrassed in my life.


834
01:02:16.419 --> 01:02:18.505
Oh, shut your filthy, stinking mouth!

835
01:02:28.556 --> 01:02:32.185
If you're interested in saving your father's life
you'd better listen and listen carefully.


836
01:02:33.978 --> 01:02:36.439
I'm gonna have to say some things
I don't want to say.


837
01:02:38.942 --> 01:02:41.944
The men who beat up Mr. McDaniel this morning
are desperate.


838
01:02:43.363 --> 01:02:48.618
Do you understand? Desperate. You saw what they did.
Now the reason for that... listen to me...


839
01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.913
Never mind the reason...

840
01:02:53.039 --> 01:02:56.126
Just understand this. 
They'll kill your father if we don't do something.

841
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:58.712
They'll go right into that hospital.

842
01:02:59.629 --> 01:03:03.800
And there'll be so many of them the Sheriff won't know
what to do. They'll blow his head off.


843
01:03:07.303 --> 01:03:09.389
Listen carefully...

844
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.269
If you want to save your father's life...

845
01:03:15.979 --> 01:03:17.981
This is what you're gonna have to do...

846
01:03:22.652 --> 01:03:24.654
Man, the science teacher today...

847
01:03:25.739 --> 01:03:29.367
She wants us to study frogs, man, I don't know.
-Oh, you're just afraid to touch 'em, that's all


848
01:03:33.747 --> 01:03:35.749
I don't know about you, but...

849
01:03:36.332 --> 01:03:37.792
I can't tell 'em apart.

850
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.890
Excuse me, but are you Joey Green?

851
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.601
That's right.

852
01:03:54.310 --> 01:03:56.978
Well, I'm Ella McDaniel.
Tom McDaniel's daughter?


853
01:03:58.271 --> 01:04:01.483
Oh, I heard about what happened yesterday.
I hope he's better.


854
01:04:03.693 --> 01:04:05.487
-Is he?
-Yes, he's a lot better.


855
01:04:05.862 --> 01:04:08.865
I wish you'd thank him for us, Miss.
He did a real fine thing.


856
01:04:09.658 --> 01:04:11.242
He's a fine man.

857
01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.036
I know.

858
01:04:14.162 --> 01:04:17.040
Well, better get going.
The bell's about to ring.


859
01:04:21.628 --> 01:04:23.922
Oh, wait a second... 
I wonder if you'd do me a favor?

860
01:04:24.423 --> 01:04:25.758
Sure, if I can.

861
01:04:25.925 --> 01:04:27.218
Well, it isn't much.

862
01:04:27.927 --> 01:04:30.721
See, I'm working down in the storage room
and I've got to get some things, and


863
01:04:31.514 --> 01:04:32.807
well, I could use a little help.

864
01:04:33.431 --> 01:04:35.725
Well, I have to ask Ms. Sangoff, wait right here though
- Oh, I spoke to her...


865
01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:38.687
She doesn't mind, it'll
just take a few minutes.

866
01:04:38.895 --> 01:04:40.981
I wish you could
help me with some things.

867
01:04:42.482 --> 01:04:43.984
Well, okay.

868
01:04:45.193 --> 01:04:45.986
Well, come on.

869
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.074
Come on.

870
01:04:58.666 --> 01:05:01.043
Wait here a second until I put the
other light on.


871
01:05:01.335 --> 01:05:02.336
Okay.

872
01:05:14.222 --> 01:05:16.433
All right.

873
01:05:22.112 --> 01:05:23.406
Over here.

874
01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:29.967
Up here, it's these two boxes.

875
01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.468
-Okay.
-Miss McDaniel?


876
01:05:56.556 --> 01:05:57.933
Miss McDaniel?

877
01:06:05.107 --> 01:06:07.068
What's the matter, Uncle John,
Won't he let you beat him?


878
01:06:09.904 --> 01:06:12.698
- It happened!
-Danny, we don't know what you're talking about.


879
01:06:12.823 --> 01:06:13.908
Tell us. What happened?

880
01:06:15.368 --> 01:06:16.494
A nigger
tried to rape a white girl.


881
01:06:18.204 --> 01:06:19.747
You know the one they call Joe Greene?
Happened 20 minutes ago.


882
01:06:19.956 --> 01:06:22.541
Ella McDaniel, you know her. The fella who's
in the hospital's daughter.


883
01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:24.710
I knew it would happen!

884
01:06:25.961 --> 01:06:31.967
Where is that feller?
Principal's office--they got him locked up there.


885
01:06:29.702 --> 01:06:34.594
Well, this is precisely what
we've been afraid of, isn't it?

886
01:06:34.595 --> 01:06:35.595
Are we going to do something about it?

887
01:06:35.637 --> 01:06:37.472
All right, go get
all members of the society.

888
01:06:39.558 --> 01:06:42.144
Tell them to be here as quickly as they can.
Right now.


889
01:06:43.646 --> 01:06:44.855
Tell them what happened at the school
and they'll come.


890
01:06:48.818 --> 01:06:51.070
Danny, you go on back, round up
as many kids as you can,


891
01:06:51.821 --> 01:06:53.239
Buck a head - guaranteed.

892
01:06:56.617 --> 01:06:59.120
- This better work!
- It will.


893
01:07:00.121 --> 01:07:02.581
If you keep your mouth shut and don't
start thinking on you own, it will.


894
01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:04.374
But McDaniel's gonna talk, I know it.

895
01:07:04.874 --> 01:07:07.502
Probably so after what you
did to him, you idiot.

896
01:07:07.669 --> 01:07:10.589
- What are you gonna do?
- End this thing!


897
01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:12.258
How?

898
01:07:13.175 --> 01:07:15.177
That's the last question I
want to hear from you.

899
01:07:16.387 --> 01:07:17.763
From now on, I'll do
all the thinking, Understood? Understood?

900
01:07:19.348 --> 01:07:21.559
Now get out of here
and get us some people fast.

901
01:07:28.441 --> 01:07:29.650
Hello, Vern?

902
01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:34.030
Adam. I've got some news for you.

903
01:07:35.823 --> 01:07:40.410
Calmly, Ella, tell us
once again, exactly what happened.

904
01:07:41.328 --> 01:07:44.664
I know it's hard for you to
talk, but it is a very serious charge

905
01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:46.584
you've made and we've got
to get our facts straight.

906
01:07:46.626 --> 01:07:47.585
You understand that, don't you?

907
01:07:49.503 --> 01:07:50.379
Ella, please!

908
01:07:50.713 --> 01:07:51.589
I told you!

909
01:07:52.006 --> 01:07:55.009
Ella, why did you want
those pants at that particular time?

910
01:07:55.468 --> 01:07:56.886
Because we were out...

911
01:07:57.678 --> 01:08:00.848
I understand that, but why didn't you get Mrs. Ziegried
to get one of the boys to do it for you?


912
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:01.891
Oh, I do not know...

913
01:08:02.767 --> 01:08:05.269
I 'd like to be
excused now if you don't mind.

914
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:08.856
Very well, Mrs. 
Ziegfried, you're excused

915
01:08:10.191 --> 01:08:11.817
Wait a minute.

916
01:08:14.028 --> 01:08:16.405
Ella, is there anymore
you want to tell us?

917
01:08:18.241 --> 01:08:19.534
All right, you can go.

918
01:08:20.117 --> 01:08:21.744
I called your house,
but your mother isn't there


919
01:08:21.953 --> 01:08:23.204
You want to call her at the hospital?

920
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:26.791
Perhaps in that case
Mrs. Ziegfried will drive you home.


921
01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:36.092
I don't believe it. I don't believe any part of it,
do you?


922
01:08:37.009 --> 01:08:38.386
I don't know what to think.

923
01:08:38.803 --> 01:08:41.806
If it'd been any other girl, 
I'd say she's lying.

924
01:08:42.974 --> 01:08:43.850
But Tom McDaniel's daughter...

925
01:08:44.058 --> 01:08:45.685
Oh, I don't care whose daughter..

926
01:08:46.269 --> 01:08:49.480
We both know Joey
Green is too smart to do anythin so stupid.


927
01:08:49.981 --> 01:08:51.190
Ella is lying.

928
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:53.569
Well, it doesn't much matter now.

929
01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:55.736
It's her story. 
Convince any jury.

930
01:08:55.778 --> 01:08:58.072
Humboldt boy said he saw
Green sneak down after her.

931
01:08:58.948 --> 01:09:00.741
I'm afraid we're beaten.

932
01:09:12.336 --> 01:09:14.213
Hello, get me the Sheriff, right away!

933
01:09:15.214 --> 01:09:16.299
Go get Joey Green.

934
01:09:18.134 --> 01:09:21.304
Hello, Rudy! Rudy this is Ronney Patton--
Now listen carefully


935
01:09:21.512 --> 01:09:23.681
I want you to get as many men as you can and
get over to the school right away.


936
01:09:24.099 --> 01:09:25.809
We have a problem
with one of our students.

937
01:09:26.185 --> 01:09:28.187
Yes, one of the colored students.

938
01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.023
Rudy, we've got a mob outside!

939
01:09:37.278 --> 01:09:38.446
Lock the door.

940
01:09:38.488 --> 01:09:41.324
And don't be frightened, I just talked to
Sheriff Parkhouse. He'll be here in a minute.


941
01:09:41.365 --> 01:09:42.366
There's nothing to worry about.

942
01:09:43.743 --> 01:09:45.453
I didn't do it, Mr. Patton.

943
01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:47.163
I know you didn't, Joey

944
01:09:48.331 --> 01:09:50.041
Patton! You give us him, Patton!

945
01:09:52.543 --> 01:09:53.336
What do you want?

946
01:09:53.544 --> 01:09:55.838
You know what we want!

947
01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.552
We want the nigger who raped a white girl
in the school!


948
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.014
and we know it's there.

949
01:10:13.147 --> 01:10:15.107
Exactly 5 minutes and if that nigger ain't out here by then
we're coming in to get him.


950
01:10:16.984 --> 01:10:18.528
That right?

951
01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.787
Tell me, how would you explain it?

952
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:30.081
I think somebody must have put her up to it.
It's the only thing I can think.


953
01:10:33.043 --> 01:10:34.753
Adam Cramer?

954
01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:39.133
You're on our side, aren't you, Mr. Patton?

955
01:10:41.635 --> 01:10:43.137
Yes, Joey 
- I am.

956
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.514
Well, you figure we're whipped now?

957
01:10:45.722 --> 01:10:47.140
One minute, Patton!

958
01:10:48.641 --> 01:10:49.934
Remember, no violence!

959
01:10:51.018 --> 01:10:53.396
We gave Sheriff Parkhouse our promse to bring
him to jail.


960
01:10:53.729 --> 01:10:55.773
We're not a mob, we're a citizen's committee.

961
01:11:02.488 --> 01:11:04.282
You tell 'em, Carey.

962
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.874
Remember, no violence.

963
01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:14.668
There isn't any need for it.

964
01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.298
Don't worry, they'll see what they cause,
they'll see how we take care of it.


965
01:11:19.506 --> 01:11:21.049
Come on, let's go get the nigger!

966
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:24.969
I wouldn't bother with that, Mr. Patton

967
01:11:25.344 --> 01:11:27.638
I think Sheriff Parkhouse
gonna be a little late.

968
01:11:27.847 --> 01:11:31.142
Joey, you come with me. My car's in the back
I'll drive you to Paragut.


969
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:33.060
No, that's what they want.

970
01:11:34.437 --> 01:11:35.438
Joey.

971
01:12:01.464 --> 01:12:04.425
Did you people want to talk to me?

972
01:12:10.849 --> 01:12:13.143
You Joseph Green?
That's right.


973
01:12:13.352 --> 01:12:16.438
Do you admit that you tried to
rape one of our white girls today?


974
01:12:18.399 --> 01:12:21.402
- No, I don't.
- What do you mean "No, you don't"?


975
01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:23.695
I mean I didn't try to rape anyone.

976
01:12:24.446 --> 01:12:25.906
- You're lying, nigger!
- Now you be still!


977
01:12:27.699 --> 01:12:30.327
We're gonna listen to
what this boy has to say for himself.


978
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.706
So you claim you're innocent.
Is that right?


979
01:12:35.124 --> 01:12:35.999
That's right.

980
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:40.002
Didn't anybody ever teach you to
address to a white man as "sir"?


981
01:12:44.466 --> 01:12:45.718
Now let that be your first lesson.

982
01:12:48.262 --> 01:12:51.181
Got blood on your
mouth, boy. Wipe it off.

983
01:12:53.475 --> 01:12:55.769
Well, what do you say?

984
01:12:56.562 --> 01:12:58.772
- Thank you. Thank you what?

985
01:13:00.566 --> 01:13:02.151
Thank you, sir.

986
01:13:06.947 --> 01:13:09.450
Now I'm gonna ask you
just one more time, boy.

987
01:13:12.244 --> 01:13:15.038
And I want you
to think before you answer.

988
01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:17.707
You think real hard.

989
01:13:18.417 --> 01:13:21.170
'Cause if you tell us the truth,
you got nothing to be afraid of,


990
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:23.422
but if you lie to us...

991
01:13:25.007 --> 01:13:28.886
You gonna be in more
trouble than you ever dreamed of.

992
01:13:35.059 --> 01:13:36.894
Were you in that basement?

993
01:13:38.687 --> 01:13:39.772
I was in the basement.

994
01:13:40.147 --> 01:13:41.648
With a white girl.

995
01:13:42.775 --> 01:13:44.360
Yes, sir.

996
01:13:45.569 --> 01:13:47.071
I think we should
take him to jail now.

997
01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:56.914
You were alone with a
white girl in the basement of the school.


998
01:13:57.539 --> 01:14:00.626
But you didn't try to do anything?

999
01:14:01.126 --> 01:14:02.211
Is that what you're saying?

1000
01:14:02.419 --> 01:14:04.296
Is that what expect
us to believe it, nigger?

1001
01:14:05.214 --> 01:14:06.590
Respect!

1002
01:14:18.185 --> 01:14:20.813
Only a coward would hit a defenseless boy.

1003
01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:23.607
Is that what you're calling me, Patton?

1004
01:14:23.817 --> 01:14:26.528
Yes, that's exactly, what I'm calling you

1005
01:14:26.778 --> 01:14:28.613
You're a miserable, yellow coward, Mr. Shipman

1006
01:14:29.571 --> 01:14:30.948
Just like every cheap bully in the world.

1007
01:14:31.448 --> 01:14:33.367
And that goes for
you too, Mr. Adam Cramer.

1008
01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:35.244
And everyone arround here!

1009
01:14:35.744 --> 01:14:37.955
Now, do I make myself perfectly clear?

1010
01:14:43.919 --> 01:14:47.214
We'll wait in my office
until the Farugut Police arrive.

1011
01:14:47.423 --> 01:14:50.301
If you want to avoid a jail sentence, I would
advise all of you people to leave at once.


1012
01:14:56.098 --> 01:14:59.476
Do you admit it?

1013
01:15:00.645 --> 01:15:01.855
Well, that's too bad,
you give us no choice.

1014
01:15:06.692 --> 01:15:08.694
Where do you think you're going, nigger?

1015
01:16:32.403 --> 01:16:34.405
Hold on there a minute.

1016
01:16:38.868 --> 01:16:41.204
Hello, Adam.

1017
01:16:41.413 --> 01:16:42.414
Ella?

1018
01:16:42.622 --> 01:16:45.625
Like I said, you never wanna be
too sure of anything.


1019
01:16:45.792 --> 01:16:47.961
Who are you?
The name is Griffin. Sam Griffin.


1020
01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:51.506
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothing now.


1021
01:16:53.049 --> 01:16:54.884
Then move aside.

1022
01:16:56.469 --> 01:16:58.263
We got important business to attend to.

1023
01:16:58.762 --> 01:17:00.639
What kind of business, Mr. Shipman?

1024
01:17:01.056 --> 01:17:02.850
You folks aiming to
do something to this boy.

1025
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:05.936
Look, Griffin, I don't know who you think you are
and I don't know why you brought this girl here.


1026
01:17:06.562 --> 01:17:08.480
Because if you do, I think maybe
there's something you ought to hear.


1027
01:17:08.939 --> 01:17:10.733
It just might affect this business you're on.

1028
01:17:11.234 --> 01:17:12.319
Tell them Miss McDaniel.

1029
01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:13.820
Tell them what you told me.

1030
01:17:15.614 --> 01:17:16.823
It was a lie!

1031
01:17:16.948 --> 01:17:18.241
What's that?
What are you talking about?


1032
01:17:18.992 --> 01:17:22.120
It was a lie.

1033
01:17:23.204 --> 01:17:24.956
Everything. Everything I said
about Joey. All of it.

1034
01:17:25.498 --> 01:17:26.791
What the devil do you mean?

1035
01:17:27.292 --> 01:17:29.211
She means her father told to cover up for the nigger,
and that's what she is doing!


1036
01:17:34.382 --> 01:17:38.385
Girl! You listen here to me.
Why would a girl go ahead and tell a story like that if it wasn't the truth?


1037
01:17:39.053 --> 01:17:41.931
The fact is she was put up to it by
our friend Mr. Cramer here. Aint' that right, Adam.


1038
01:17:42.765 --> 01:17:44.016
Vern, this guy is crazy.

1039
01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:45.644
Shut up! You go on!

1040
01:17:46.144 --> 01:17:47.687
Your boy was going desperate, Mr. Shipman.

1041
01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.981
He was on the verge of losing
everything he built up.


1042
01:17:50.148 --> 01:17:52.442
So he threatened the girl,
told her he'd kill her father.


1043
01:17:52.943 --> 01:17:55.153
Vern, don't listen to him,
This man  is crazy, I tell you.


1044
01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:56.821
Is that right, girl?

1045
01:17:57.739 --> 01:17:59.741
He promised me there
wouldn't be any trouble,


1046
01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:01.910
he said nothing would happen to the boy

1047
01:18:02.410 --> 01:18:04.204
except he might be expelled.

1048
01:18:05.205 --> 01:18:07.082
I'm sorry!

1049
01:18:07.123 --> 01:18:09.709
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean for this to happen!


1050
01:18:10.794 --> 01:18:12.878
All right now, you go on back to the car,
it'll be all right.


1051
01:18:17.801 --> 01:18:18.677
Ella...

1052
01:18:55.213 --> 01:18:57.299
Right now you good
people are probably telling yourselves

1053
01:18:57.591 --> 01:19:00.385
you were going to take this boy down to jail
and see a little justice done


1054
01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:02.012
but that ain't the truth.

1055
01:19:02.387 --> 01:19:05.098
You were gonna kill this boy.
You know it and I know it.


1056
01:19:05.599 --> 01:19:07.392
You'll know it all
the rest of your lives.

1057
01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:15.484
And you. You're thinking everything would have been just fine if
you and me hadn't had our little personal difficulties.


1058
01:19:15.942 --> 01:19:16.860
That ain't the truth, either.

1059
01:19:17.277 --> 01:19:19.571
You began losing your grip on these people
the second you got it.


1060
01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:23.366
'Cause nobody, nobody can have the kind of power
you thought you had Mr. Cramer.


1061
01:19:25.453 --> 01:19:27.038
Lies.

1062
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.248
Lies!

1063
01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:33.627
I swear to God
this man's lying to you!

1064
01:19:43.804 --> 01:19:45.597
Are you all crazy?

1065
01:19:49.392 --> 01:19:51.186
Tell them the truth, come on! 
Tell them the truth.

1066
01:19:51.978 --> 01:19:54.773
All about your Jew wife, maybe they'd
like to hear about that, eh?


1067
01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:59.569
Tell them about the nigger women
you kissed on the mouth. You did!


1068
01:20:00.071 --> 01:20:03.658
I've got proof. Proof! You hear me? 
You hear what I'm saying?

1069
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:12.415
Griffin, you don't think for a minute you're
fooling these people, do you?


1070
01:20:12.958 --> 01:20:14.334
Because if you do, you're wrong,

1071
01:20:14.918 --> 01:20:18.547
They're too smart for you and your filth.
Believe me, I know them, I know they're too smart.


1072
01:20:20.423 --> 01:20:24.761
They're with me, Griffin! They're with me, Griffin!
With me!


1073
01:20:26.429 --> 01:20:28.223
They'll laugh at you,
because you are nothing. Nothing!

1074
01:20:34.105 --> 01:20:37.775
Folks, they think they've got
us scared, but they haven't.

1075
01:20:38.276 --> 01:20:40.027
We aren't gonna give up now.

1076
01:20:41.487 --> 01:20:42.487
Not now!

1077
01:20:42.779 --> 01:20:45.490
No sir, not ever.
You hear that, Griffin?


1078
01:20:47.784 --> 01:20:49.578
Patton, you hear what I'm saying? 
You hear what I'm saying!

1079
01:20:53.665 --> 01:20:56.835
You talk to them. 
They'll listen to you, Vern.

1080
01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:02.549
Hey, Vern! A meeting tonight. 
The Palace Cafe. 7:30.

1081
01:21:06.512 --> 01:21:08.347
Patton, you and your
nigger better listen to this!

1082
01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.435
We're gonna show you you can't stop justice and right
no matter what you do!


1083
01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:14.729
This is just the beginning!

1084
01:21:15.772 --> 01:21:16.856
Only the beginning!

1085
01:21:17.064 --> 01:21:18.232
Adam Cramer.

1086
01:21:53.935 --> 01:21:55.103
Boy...

1087
01:21:56.770 --> 01:22:00.023
Your'e gonna get grass stains all over those trousers
you don't get up.


1088
01:22:02.901 --> 01:22:03.902
Come on.

1089
01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:05.862
That's better.

1090
01:22:07.114 --> 01:22:10.367
I figure your work
in this town's about over.

1091
01:22:10.826 --> 01:22:12.619
If you hurry, you can catch the bus to Faragut. 
They got trains there.

1092
01:22:13.746 --> 01:22:15.373
If you're a little light on traveling money,
I'd be proud to...


1093
01:22:15.873 --> 01:22:17.500
You're sure now?

1094
01:22:19.085 --> 01:22:20.795
Oh, almost forgot.

1095
01:22:23.381 --> 01:22:25.550
These belong to you.

1096
01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:30.471
I wouldn't want to steal from you, boy.
