00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:12.202
Quando era pequeno, a minha mamãe e eu
olhe o Mago da Onça cada domingo.


2
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.072
E cada domingo pela noite,
ela me preguearia na cama...


3
00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.776
e cante a nossa canção favorita do filme.

4
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.718
Não foi Por Cima do Arco-íris
ou Siga o Caminho de Tijolo Amarelo.


5
00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:24.621
Ele foi a canção quando Dorothy
Cidade de Esmeralda de aproximações pela primeira vez.


6
00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.784
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark


7
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.657
You're out of the night

8
00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.060
Step into the sun
Step into the light


9
00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.267
... and open your
eyes, and let them open.

10
00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.166
Open, open.

11
00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.498
To me that was the happiest song
in the world.


12
00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:44.237
Like nothing could go wrong once
Dorothy got to the gates of Emerald City.


13
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.370
But that's the thing about life.

14
00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.313
You're just flying right along
without a care in the world...


15
00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.977
until one day, unexpectedly, you land.

16
00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:37.862
- Do you know what time it is?
- Surrender, Dorothy.


17
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.731
Surrender, Dorothy. I'm up.
Listen, he's sleeping.


18
00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:48.635
Listen.

19
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.312
He's snoring.

20
00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:02.651
- When are you guys leaving?
- Pretty soon. Very soon.


21
00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.555
Hey, thanks for letting me use your car.

22
00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.027
Just don't get
another speeding ticket, okay?


23
00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:12.757
I'll let you go.

24
00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:16.065
That'll be the day. I love you, Mom.

25
00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:17.430
Love you.

26
00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:29.208
Sara! Sara, hurry up!

27
00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.406
Adam, I'll be right down.

28
00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.224
I thought that you were gonna end it
with him last night.


29
00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:49.199
I did. Nothing wrong
with a little break-up sex.


30
00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:50.792
- Come on.
- Oh, what a trooper.


31
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.135
Can you please find us some tunes?
I know my mom's got Tina Turner in there.


32
00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:56.140
These aren't tapes. 
These are fossils.

33
00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.938
Carole King? "The Best of Barbra"?

34
00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:03.277
Now how is it your mom hates me
when she, too, is clearly a gay man?


35
00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.085
- Want some?
- No, it's not my color.


36
00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:08.585
Right, of course.

37
00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:11.145
Isn't this how Jayne Mansfield died?

38
00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:13.181
Give us a kiss.

39
00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:17.121
Sara, slow down!

40
00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:27.067
You're laughing. That's great.

41
00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:03.798
We're here, sweetie. 
Adam, wake up.

42
00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.048
So you made it.

43
00:04:22.126 --> 00:04:24.424
Hi, Mrs. Moyles. 
Pleasure to see you.

44
00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:28.124
It's our seventh anniversary at the house,
Mrs. Moyles. We brought you a pie.


45
00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.223
Raspberry.

46
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.736
What am I supposed to do with that?
I've got diabetes.


47
00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.840
And I'd appreciate it
if for one damn summer...


48
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:44.075
you kids would clean up
and not leave my home a pigsty.


49
00:04:44.315 --> 00:04:47.079
- Okay, no problem.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Moyles.


50
00:04:50.488 --> 00:04:53.082
- Bye!
- Bye, see you in a month.


51
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:05.458
Can you believe this?

52
00:05:07.338 --> 00:05:09.533
- Was that a cockroach?
- Where?


53
00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:19.976
How did we manage to find
the only slumlord in the Hamptons?


54
00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:36.129
Thought I might find you up here.

55
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.861
Life at the top is good.

56
00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.002
Great view. Care to join me, scaredy-cat?

57
00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:42.601
- Come on.
- No.


58
00:05:42.673 --> 00:05:43.731
Hey, anybody here?

59
00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:44.797
- Sara?
- Adam!


60
00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.070
- They're here.
- Sara.


61
00:05:46.144 --> 00:05:47.543
- All right. Are you guys here?
- Go, go, go!


62
00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:50.103
- Go, go, go!
- Adam! Sara! Hello?


63
00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:52.543
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi.


64
00:05:52.617 --> 00:05:54.881
- Maddy!
- How are you?


65
00:05:54.952 --> 00:05:58.353
- Another summer.
- Adam, how you doing? How are you?


66
00:05:58.423 --> 00:06:01.722
- Still gay. How are you?
- Place looks great. Smells good, too.


67
00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:03.727
Still a health-code violation.

68
00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:05.922
Hey, sweetie. So good to see you.

69
00:06:05.997 --> 00:06:08.864
- He is beautiful, really.
- He got Mom's good looks.


70
00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:10.457
Yeah, good thing.

71
00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:11.866
Too big.

72
00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.460
- Hi!
- That'll be for me.


73
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.864
Sorry, you guys.

74
00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:19.068
Who this?

75
00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:22.873
You look so good.

76
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.673
- Surrender, Dorothy.
- Surrender, Dorothy.


77
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:28.741
Hi, Mom. Only been here a couple hours.
What took you so long?


78
00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:30.286
I thought I'd give you a little space.

79
00:06:30.353 --> 00:06:33.481
Sara is back there paying homage
to the wicked witch of East Jersey.


80
00:06:33.557 --> 00:06:34.922
I made him your egg-white omelet.

81
00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:37.289
He wants to see
me again. I said yes.

82
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.191
- Wow, he moves fast.
- I know.


83
00:06:39.296 --> 00:06:42.265
Mom, everyone just turned up at the house.
Can I call you back?


84
00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:43.727
I love you.

85
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.200
- I love you, too, Mom. Okay, bye.
- Bye-bye.


86
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.594
Sorry.

87
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:50.231
- How's Natalie? Still interesting?
- Yes, of course.


88
00:06:50.307 --> 00:06:52.104
Yeah, nobody wants interesting parents.

89
00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:55.508
Parents should be completely boring
and stable. Like Peter and Maddy here.


90
00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:57.240
- Yeah.
- Yes.


91
00:06:57.314 --> 00:06:59.475
- I agree.
- That's nice.


92
00:06:59.683 --> 00:07:02.584
Sara, thank you so much for having me.
It's a pleasure to be here.


93
00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:04.711
- Nice to meet you.
- And before I forget...


94
00:07:05.055 --> 00:07:07.080
I have a...

95
00:07:08.024 --> 00:07:09.651
bayberry candle.

96
00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.889
It's gross, I know.
It's all they had at the train station.


97
00:07:12.963 --> 00:07:16.330
Don't feel bad. We brought a raspberry pie
to a diabetic, so...


98
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.600
Oh, yeah. Come in. 
Come in, guys.

99
00:07:24.207 --> 00:07:26.232
Okay! I have a question.
Hold on, I have a question.


100
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:29.244
- What is a notary public?
- What?


101
00:07:30.714 --> 00:07:33.547
- What is that?
- That's very good, I've thought about this.


102
00:07:33.617 --> 00:07:35.414
I know we all need them
every once in a while.


103
00:07:35.485 --> 00:07:37.715
They stamp whatever, but what are they?

104
00:07:37.787 --> 00:07:39.277
How do they get
to be who they are?

105
00:07:39.356 --> 00:07:41.324
I don't know.
I think they go to school for it, though.


106
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:43.382
- What do they learn in notary public school?
- Stamping.


107
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.020
Ten hundred thousand jillion things
you could be and you're like:


108
00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:47.620
"I think I'll be a notary public."

109
00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:51.360
It's truly one of the great mysteries
of the universe.


110
00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:52.992
You know, kind of like
why the ears and the nose...


111
00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:55.128
are the only things that keep growing.

112
00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:57.867
And the one thing that you want
to keep growing just shrinks.


113
00:08:00.577 --> 00:08:02.135
It must be terrifying, getting old.

114
00:08:02.212 --> 00:08:04.737
No offense, but you're not
getting any younger.


115
00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:07.374
- Yeah, guy, like young was last year.
- Pipe down.


116
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.315
Young was over two summers ago.

117
00:08:09.386 --> 00:08:11.411
Well, then, I guess
I should just stop writing plays...


118
00:08:11.488 --> 00:08:13.149
that are set in my parents' rec room.

119
00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:15.214
No. No more plays starring Sara?

120
00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:19.285
You know, Adam bases all
of his lead characters on the beautiful Sara.


121
00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:23.560
That's only because I make him finish them
and stick them in the mailbox.


122
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.134
- That sounds dirty.
- So sweet.


123
00:08:27.637 --> 00:08:29.969
- You know what would be good right now?
- Skinny-dipping.


124
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.768
- No.
- Come on.


125
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.774
- No.
- Come on.


126
00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:36.438
- Fro-Z-Cone.
- Fro-Z-Cone.


127
00:08:36.812 --> 00:08:38.609
What is Fro
-Z
-Cone?

128
00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:44.786
- You hate Shawn.
- That is ridiculous.


129
00:08:44.853 --> 00:08:46.480
It's all right. 
I hate him a little bit, too.

130
00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:47.954
Look, then stop projecting.

131
00:08:48.023 --> 00:08:50.958
He's charming,
but he's kind of an opportunist.


132
00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:54.052
- He's an actorltelemarketer.
- Oh, good.


133
00:08:54.129 --> 00:08:56.154
But he really likes me.

134
00:08:56.532 --> 00:08:59.797
- You could at least pretend to like him.
- I like him. Okay? L...


135
00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:01.893
God knows that I have pretended to like...

136
00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:04.599
some of the losers that
you have brought home over the years.


137
00:09:04.673 --> 00:09:07.301
Do not compare us.
I bring home losers for good reasons.


138
00:09:07.376 --> 00:09:08.570
What good reasons?

139
00:09:08.644 --> 00:09:11.135
Well, if they weren't losers,
I'd end up marrying one.


140
00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:13.704
And then I'd end up
stuck in the tri-state area...


141
00:09:13.816 --> 00:09:15.750
having obligatory orgasms...

142
00:09:15.985 --> 00:09:19.113
dealing with crying babies
and arguing over mortgages...


143
00:09:19.188 --> 00:09:22.214
and I don't know if
I'm ready for all that.

144
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.918
No wonder you're not growing up.

145
00:09:23.993 --> 00:09:26.757
I'm growing up. 
I'm just not in a hurry.

146
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:27.989
Hey, we're here.

147
00:09:28.731 --> 00:09:30.096
Fro
-Z
-Cone.

148
00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:47.008
Fro-Z-Cone.
So fattening, we all head toward it.


149
00:09:48.317 --> 00:09:50.308
Look, there's Betty. 
She's still here.

150
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.911
Hi, Betty. Three pints, please.

151
00:09:53.989 --> 00:09:56.253
Strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate.

152
00:09:56.325 --> 00:09:59.226
Well, why don't you just get
two quarts of Neapolitan?


153
00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:01.852
She doesn't like her food to touch.

154
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:09.660
Okay, does the fact that Betty has a beard
also mean that she has no best friend?


155
00:10:09.738 --> 00:10:11.399
- Why?
- Because you're my best friend...


156
00:10:11.473 --> 00:10:14.135
and if I had a beard like Betty's,
you'd tell me to trim it, right?


157
00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:15.233
I would.

158
00:10:15.344 --> 00:10:16.743
That's sad.

159
00:10:17.146 --> 00:10:18.943
Betty has no best friend.

160
00:10:35.297 --> 00:10:37.697
Hey, check the glove compartment.

161
00:10:39.568 --> 00:10:42.092
- What are these?
- Magic mushrooms.


162
00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:44.871
Great with ice cream.
Put them in your pocket for later.


163
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.326
You know, I remember listening to this,
I'm sorry, and wondering, "Why, Van, why?"


164
00:11:10.398 --> 00:11:14.425
I couldn't give a rat's ass
about a brown-eyed girl.


165
00:11:14.502 --> 00:11:17.062
Or a blue-eyed girl, or a green-eyed girl.

166
00:11:17.138 --> 00:11:18.332
Except for me.

167
00:11:18.406 --> 00:11:19.930
Except for my Sara.

168
00:11:53.541 --> 00:11:54.667
Sara.

169
00:11:58.346 --> 00:11:59.438
Sara.

170
00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:34.207
Sorry. Sorry, just a sec.

171
00:12:37.785 --> 00:12:38.809
Hello?

172
00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:42.117
You know those contractors,
the ones I hired after the plumbing?


173
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.990
Yeah. You know what, Carol?
I can't speak right now.


174
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.425
Is someone there?

175
00:12:48.395 --> 00:12:50.192
Does he have a penis?

176
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.131
Actually, I was about to find out.

177
00:13:06.513 --> 00:13:10.313
Why don't we unplug the phone
for the rest of the night, huh?


178
00:13:20.527 --> 00:13:21.994
Where is she?

179
00:14:21.655 --> 00:14:24.522
Thank you for dinner. 
I had a great time.

180
00:14:25.292 --> 00:14:27.852
Natalie, I'd like to see you again.

181
00:14:27.994 --> 00:14:29.586
Very, very soon.

182
00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:32.260
Well, yeah.

183
00:14:35.669 --> 00:14:36.931
Bye-bye.

184
00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:01.752
Surrender, Dorothy.

185
00:15:01.827 --> 00:15:05.593
Honey, wait, hold on. Let me just
turn the volume down for a sec here.


186
00:15:06.298 --> 00:15:09.062
Does your landlady know
you're using her phone?


187
00:15:09.134 --> 00:15:12.331
- Mrs. Swerdlow, this is Peter.
- Who?


188
00:15:12.705 --> 00:15:15.333
Sara's friend Peter.
You came to our wedding?


189
00:15:15.407 --> 00:15:17.102
- Sara's wedding?
- No, ma'am.


190
00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:18.437
Oh, God.

191
00:15:18.544 --> 00:15:22.412
Peter, I'm kidding you.
Of course I know who you are.


192
00:15:22.681 --> 00:15:25.673
You guys just had that baby.
Congratulations.


193
00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:29.679
- Yeah, but I'm calling for a reason.
- What's that?


194
00:15:30.422 --> 00:15:32.652
- Is she in her car?
- Are you in your car?


195
00:15:32.725 --> 00:15:35.717
Well, I mean, you did call me
on my car phone.


196
00:15:36.695 --> 00:15:38.754
Mrs. Swerdlow, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this...


197
00:15:38.864 --> 00:15:39.853
but there's been an accident.

198
00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:44.131
What do you mean, an accident? With Sara?

199
00:15:44.303 --> 00:15:47.033
Mrs. Swerdlow, are you some place
where maybe you can pull over...


200
00:15:47.106 --> 00:15:48.437
and we can talk for a moment?

201
00:15:48.507 --> 00:15:52.841
Why? I mean, Sara's okay, isn't she?
Sara's all right, right, Peter?


202
00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:54.406
Peter, will you please answer me?

203
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.505
- She's driving.
- Make her pull over.


204
00:15:56.582 --> 00:15:57.708
Just tell me what happened.

205
00:15:57.783 --> 00:16:00.684
For God sakes, Peter.
What the hell happened?


206
00:16:01.153 --> 00:16:03.178
Sara's dead, Mrs. Swerdlow.

207
00:16:06.558 --> 00:16:10.494
Hello? Mrs. Swerdlow, are you there?

208
00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:12.325
Hey.

209
00:16:12.898 --> 00:16:14.559
The phone's cutting out.

210
00:17:01.513 --> 00:17:05.346
This is really difficult for me.
Much harder for you, I know.


211
00:17:07.218 --> 00:17:09.413
But I'm not very good with death.

212
00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:13.485
What are you trying to say, Harvey?

213
00:17:16.527 --> 00:17:18.051
I understand.

214
00:18:11.282 --> 00:18:13.375
No, no, no!

215
00:18:16.354 --> 00:18:17.582
You can do this.

216
00:18:18.756 --> 00:18:20.155
Okay, baby.

217
00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:22.348
Okay, baby.

218
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:25.026
Okay, you look so pretty.

219
00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:08.064
"Before restful waters, he leads me.

220
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:12.635
"He guides me in my path."

221
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.495
I'll tell you why she didn't want us
to go to the funeral. She hates me.


222
00:19:41.638 --> 00:19:42.900
That's not true.

223
00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.771
Her friend said it was private.
Just for family.


224
00:19:46.276 --> 00:19:49.177
And that she might be having
some sort of nervous breakdown.


225
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:56.680
- Why am I smoking? I don't even smoke.
- Just sit down, Adam.


226
00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:02.549
She was my best friend. You don't generally
get a new best friend after thirty.


227
00:20:02.859 --> 00:20:06.226
This is it. It's over.
And we didn't even get to say goodbye.


228
00:20:06.429 --> 00:20:08.556
She was my best friend, too.

229
00:20:09.032 --> 00:20:12.024
I'm not going to fall off the roof for her
and break my neck, okay?


230
00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:13.967
So just sit down, Adam.

231
00:20:23.213 --> 00:20:25.443
Why did I want that ice cream...

232
00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:27.673
for that ridiculous pie?

233
00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:32.487
- You got to stop beating yourself up.
- It's not your fault, man.


234
00:23:11.346 --> 00:23:14.577
Hell, there's no such thing
as a sin on holiday.


235
00:23:16.718 --> 00:23:20.210
Has this kitchen been cleaned
since the house was built?


236
00:23:23.959 --> 00:23:26.086
There he is.

237
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.627
Look at you. May I?

238
00:23:30.698 --> 00:23:33.758
Actually, no.
We try not to pass him around too much.


239
00:23:33.835 --> 00:23:37.771
Do you want some licorice, sugar?
You do, don't you?


240
00:23:37.839 --> 00:23:40.364
Licorice is so perfect for teething.

241
00:23:40.441 --> 00:23:44.172
No. Actually, we're following Upbeat Baby
by Dr. Melanie Blandish.


242
00:23:44.245 --> 00:23:47.442
And she says absolutely no refined sugar
until he's five.


243
00:23:47.515 --> 00:23:48.777
That's ridiculous.

244
00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.785
Sara teethed on licorice
and it's perfect, isn't it?


245
00:23:51.853 --> 00:23:53.548
It's so hard and chewy.

246
00:23:53.621 --> 00:23:56.055
They're not as breakable
as you think, Maddy. Babies.


247
00:23:56.124 --> 00:24:00.493
I mean, I smoked a pack a day
during my entire pregnancy.


248
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:03.792
In one hand, I had
a jar of crushed peas...

249
00:24:03.865 --> 00:24:06.095
in the other an unfiltered cigarette.

250
00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:10.467
I used to smoke in my obstetrician's
waiting room. And they even had ashtrays.


251
00:24:10.538 --> 00:24:12.301
It didn't hurt Sara.

252
00:24:12.874 --> 00:24:14.603
Can I see her room?

253
00:24:14.809 --> 00:24:18.301
I want to see her room.
Where is it, huh? Upstairs?


254
00:24:37.865 --> 00:24:38.991
This...

255
00:24:40.501 --> 00:24:42.401
This is everything?

256
00:24:45.306 --> 00:24:47.001
Where's her diary, huh?

257
00:24:47.074 --> 00:24:49.167
We haven't touched anything, really.

258
00:24:50.077 --> 00:24:53.103
I think Adam slept here one night,
but we've kind of stayed away.


259
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:54.705
You slept here?

260
00:25:01.155 --> 00:25:03.180
Look at all these language tapes.

261
00:25:03.257 --> 00:25:05.521
A PhD in Japanese history, huh?

262
00:25:05.593 --> 00:25:07.652
That was going to get her really far.

263
00:25:07.728 --> 00:25:10.253
I wonder which one of you
talked her into that.


264
00:25:10.331 --> 00:25:14.097
I mean, sure. Tokyo? 
Yeah, for a week.

265
00:25:14.168 --> 00:25:16.363
But to spend a life?

266
00:25:16.837 --> 00:25:19.567
And all that tempura? 
I mean, please.

267
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.667
I know I must sound very provincial
to all you Wesleyan grads. But trust me.


268
00:25:23.744 --> 00:25:26.304
I've seen more of the world
than any of you have.


269
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.041
Can't get a decent dessert in Japan.

270
00:25:28.115 --> 00:25:32.279
I mean, okay, green-tea ice cream?
Spare me.


271
00:25:43.964 --> 00:25:46.592
God, but she was beautiful, wasn't she?

272
00:25:47.133 --> 00:25:48.862
Yeah. Yeah, she was...

273
00:25:57.177 --> 00:26:00.442
Maybe you shouldn't drive home tonight,
Mrs. Swerdlow.


274
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.739
I'm sure you don't want me to stay here
with you and your friends.


275
00:26:04.818 --> 00:26:06.683
But you look so tired.

276
00:26:07.287 --> 00:26:10.848
You'd be tired, too,
if you hadn't slept for three days.


277
00:26:18.064 --> 00:26:20.055
So stay. Spend the night.

278
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:22.828
You talked me into it.

279
00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:30.236
Mrs. Swerdlow, I was hoping
I could have something of hers.


280
00:26:30.343 --> 00:26:31.674
Like what?

281
00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:34.269
I don't know. You know, just...

282
00:26:34.347 --> 00:26:37.282
Not much. Something small.
A little memento.


283
00:26:37.384 --> 00:26:39.011
I don't think so.

284
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:49.494
You told her she could stay?

285
00:26:49.562 --> 00:26:52.190
What was I supposed to do?
What do you say to a grieving mother?


286
00:26:52.265 --> 00:26:54.631
"Thanks for sparing me the pain
of your daughter's funeral.


287
00:26:54.701 --> 00:26:58.137
"I'm sure I would've made a spectacle
of myself, like you're doing now."


288
00:26:58.204 --> 00:27:00.434
I don't know if
I can stay here anymore.

289
00:27:00.507 --> 00:27:02.407
It's not the same without Sara.

290
00:27:02.475 --> 00:27:05.069
What do we have to go back to?
August in Brooklyn?


291
00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:07.705
No. The grieving mother
is not moving us out!


292
00:27:07.781 --> 00:27:09.681
We're staying, she's going.

293
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:16.049
Hello!

294
00:27:21.428 --> 00:27:22.918
Mrs. Swerdlow.

295
00:27:25.298 --> 00:27:26.788
Mrs. Swerdlow.

296
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.090
Mrs. Swerdlow?

297
00:28:38.137 --> 00:28:39.126
Mrs. Swerdlow.

298
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:43.230
Mrs...

299
00:28:49.515 --> 00:28:52.746
- Good morning.
- It's evening, actually, Mrs. Swerdlow.


300
00:28:52.818 --> 00:28:55.412
I know that. It was just an expression.

301
00:28:55.587 --> 00:28:57.316
Well, you should probably get up.

302
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:59.880
You've been sleeping for two days
and not eating...


303
00:28:59.958 --> 00:29:02.518
and that can't be very good for you.

304
00:29:02.594 --> 00:29:06.690
Well, whether it's good for me or not,
I don't think it's any of your business.


305
00:29:06.765 --> 00:29:07.925
Okay.

306
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:10.520
What is the deal with all the cleaning?
She's like the Brady Bunch maid on speed.


307
00:30:10.595 --> 00:30:11.857
She just lost her child.

308
00:30:11.929 --> 00:30:14.489
Where else is she supposed to put
all that maternal energy?


309
00:30:14.565 --> 00:30:17.056
How about her house back in Jersey?

310
00:30:34.185 --> 00:30:35.675
Mrs. Swerdlow.

311
00:30:36.387 --> 00:30:38.184
- Mrs. Swerdlow!
- What?


312
00:30:39.957 --> 00:30:42.551
Listen, you can just stop cleaning...

313
00:30:42.627 --> 00:30:46.290
'cause we like, you know,
the mold and stuff. It's fine.


314
00:30:46.497 --> 00:30:49.057
I'm not doing this for you. I'm fine.

315
00:30:49.133 --> 00:30:51.829
- I think what Maddy's trying to say is...
- Look, you guys.


316
00:30:51.903 --> 00:30:56.101
I'm doing what makes me feel better
and if you can't stand it, I'll just leave.


317
00:30:56.173 --> 00:30:58.334
I mean, I'll just get
a job at the Holiday Inn.

318
00:30:58.409 --> 00:31:00.274
I mean, if you can't stand
a middle-aged woman...


319
00:31:00.344 --> 00:31:03.108
walking around your house
doing what she's got to do...


320
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.307
then this just isn't gonna work.

321
00:31:05.383 --> 00:31:07.214
- Nobody wants you to leave.
- We just want you...


322
00:31:07.285 --> 00:31:10.015
There are mushrooms
growing in the bathtub.


323
00:31:15.459 --> 00:31:17.222
Look, I can't have her just turn around...

324
00:31:17.295 --> 00:31:18.956
and find out
we went out to the beach without her.


325
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.090
Just leave her alone, hon.
You know, she's in her own little world.


326
00:31:22.166 --> 00:31:25.158
Can't she just fly home
on her vacuum cleaner?


327
00:31:46.123 --> 00:31:47.590
Mrs. Swerdlow?

328
00:31:49.026 --> 00:31:50.288
A bad wife.

329
00:31:50.828 --> 00:31:52.318
Mrs. Swerdlow.

330
00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:58.064
Sorry, sorry.
Hey, we're gonna go to the beach, okay?


331
00:31:58.135 --> 00:32:02.400
- We'll be back this afternoon.
- Well, that sounds like a blast.


332
00:32:02.606 --> 00:32:05.302
- You gonna be okay?
- What? I can't come?


333
00:32:06.543 --> 00:32:08.272
Well, you know,
we didn't want to bother you.


334
00:32:08.345 --> 00:32:11.371
We're just gonna go get our feet wet
and we'll be right back.


335
00:32:12.048 --> 00:32:16.041
You don't like to talk
about your relationship with Sara, do you?


336
00:32:17.854 --> 00:32:20.846
- There's not much to say, really, you know.
- Cut the crap, Peter.


337
00:32:21.524 --> 00:32:22.582
Excuse me?

338
00:32:22.659 --> 00:32:24.354
I know what went on
between the two of you.


339
00:32:24.427 --> 00:32:26.327
Did you think I didn't?

340
00:32:26.963 --> 00:32:29.761
I know you slept together.

341
00:32:31.635 --> 00:32:33.159
No, we never slept together.

342
00:32:33.236 --> 00:32:36.672
Maybe sleep is the wrong word
for committing adultery.


343
00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:40.168
I don't know where you got that,
but it's wrong.


344
00:32:40.243 --> 00:32:42.074
- Does Maddy know?
- You don't know.


345
00:32:42.145 --> 00:32:43.544
Oh, yes, I do.

346
00:32:44.447 --> 00:32:48.076
There's hardly anything in Sara's life
I don't know about.


347
00:32:51.721 --> 00:32:54.246
It's got to be tough on you, Peter.

348
00:32:55.125 --> 00:32:58.322
You can't tell anybody
how you really felt, can you?


349
00:32:58.395 --> 00:33:00.329
But you can tell me.

350
00:33:01.998 --> 00:33:04.728
I won't be a second. 
Just let me change.

351
00:33:18.782 --> 00:33:21.410
- She's coming.
- You invited her?


352
00:33:21.484 --> 00:33:23.452
What, am I the only one here
with any manners?


353
00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.115
Okay, you get the Boy Scout merit badge
for counseling grieving divorcees.


354
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.920
Will you stop being such a little bitch?

355
00:33:30.994 --> 00:33:32.222
All set!

356
00:33:41.037 --> 00:33:43.267
Maybe you should think
about wearing something else.


357
00:33:43.339 --> 00:33:45.671
Why? We were the
same size. It all fits.

358
00:33:45.742 --> 00:33:48.176
It's a kimono. 
Of course it fits.

359
00:33:52.015 --> 00:33:54.506
Well, Natalie, I'll go with you
if you don't want to go by yourself.


360
00:33:54.584 --> 00:33:56.313
No, we can all fit in the truck.

361
00:33:56.386 --> 00:33:58.354
Come on, Mrs. Swerdlow,
you can ride up front.


362
00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:02.187
No. I'll tell you what, you kids go on ahead.
Adam and I will catch up.


363
00:34:02.258 --> 00:34:04.055
- There's plenty of room.
- I don't think so.


364
00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:06.459
I think Adam and I want to talk.

365
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:10.790
Well, I'll ride with you
if you take that off.

366
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.594
You should know,
I'm keeping her hat on forever.


367
00:34:16.271 --> 00:34:19.707
- The beach is in the other direction.
- I'm sure it is.


368
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.805
I saw a junkyard on the way in.

369
00:34:22.878 --> 00:34:25.472
Is that where you're gonna hide my body?

370
00:34:25.547 --> 00:34:28.539
You're very quick-witted.
Is that from being gay?


371
00:34:28.617 --> 00:34:29.948
Obviously.

372
00:34:37.226 --> 00:34:39.786
Is there some reason
you want to torture yourself with this?


373
00:34:39.862 --> 00:34:43.457
I'm not tortured.
You're the one who can't climb a fence.


374
00:34:47.102 --> 00:34:48.091
Jesus.

375
00:34:48.771 --> 00:34:49.863
God.

376
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.828
What if the driver
came from the other direction?


377
00:35:17.933 --> 00:35:19.332
Did you ever think about that?

378
00:35:19.935 --> 00:35:22.927
You actually think
I haven't chewed myself up about this?


379
00:35:23.005 --> 00:35:24.939
I would, if I were you.

380
00:35:26.108 --> 00:35:28.736
I mean, I can't help but wonder...

381
00:35:29.144 --> 00:35:31.874
why I'm walking through here,
and not your mother.


382
00:35:31.947 --> 00:35:34.643
Because my mother
wouldn't come looking for her car.


383
00:35:34.716 --> 00:35:36.707
I bet she'd surprise you.

384
00:35:36.919 --> 00:35:41.322
Well, I wouldn't really be around
to be surprised, would I, if I were dead?


385
00:35:41.723 --> 00:35:44.453
Look, Mrs. Swerdlow, 
I feel guilty, okay?

386
00:35:44.526 --> 00:35:46.460
I am racked with guilt.

387
00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:50.664
You want me to be dead instead of Sara.
I want me to be dead instead of Sara.


388
00:35:50.732 --> 00:35:52.893
That we agree on,
but I don't have any answers.


389
00:35:52.968 --> 00:35:56.631
I don't want any answers from you.
Well, actually, you know what?


390
00:35:59.575 --> 00:36:00.735
I do.

391
00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:02.569
Fine.

392
00:36:05.514 --> 00:36:07.141
What was it like?

393
00:36:10.085 --> 00:36:12.986
It was like being murdered
and finding out you survived.


394
00:36:13.055 --> 00:36:15.080
I wasn't asking about you.

395
00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:18.949
What was it like for Sara?

396
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:06.066
Would you tie this on for me?

397
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.075
Thank you.

398
00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.756
We found Sara's car. 
I mean, my car.

399
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:31.059
And look. Look what I found.

400
00:37:31.165 --> 00:37:33.292
- Sara's necklace.
- It's her necklace.


401
00:37:33.367 --> 00:37:34.595
It's gorgeous.

402
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:36.466
- Didn't Johnny give her that?
- No.


403
00:37:36.537 --> 00:37:37.799
Yes, he did.

404
00:37:37.872 --> 00:37:40.773
- Wait, which one was Johnny?
- Johnny, remember? They broke up?


405
00:37:40.841 --> 00:37:43.605
Right. What did she say
was wrong with him?


406
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:45.077
Everything.

407
00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.743
No, not everything.

408
00:37:48.282 --> 00:37:51.080
Don't you remember? 
He was the great lay.

409
00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:53.619
She said it.

410
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:58.057
Anyhow, he was the guy
who looked like a brontosaurus.


411
00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:01.891
He had that really huge head
and those really huge teeth.


412
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.661
He was the kind of guy,
he looked like he could just rip you apart...


413
00:38:05.733 --> 00:38:07.564
and snack on you, you know?

414
00:38:07.635 --> 00:38:12.004
And he had those really huge muscles
always bursting out of his shirt.


415
00:38:12.073 --> 00:38:14.507
The guy was totally into himself.

416
00:38:14.775 --> 00:38:18.074
Sara told me she was glad
when he went away to British Columbia.


417
00:38:18.145 --> 00:38:20.613
She didn't tell you that. 
I told you that.

418
00:38:20.681 --> 00:38:23.548
- Sara would never tell you that.
- She told me stuff.


419
00:38:23.617 --> 00:38:26.483
- Actually, we had secrets.
- You did not have secrets.


420
00:38:26.553 --> 00:38:29.147
Well, personally, 
I don't believe in secrets.

421
00:38:29.222 --> 00:38:30.746
Secrets are a necessity.

422
00:38:30.824 --> 00:38:33.952
They're like a warm blanket
you hide under with a friend.


423
00:38:34.027 --> 00:38:35.858
What a nice metaphor.

424
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:41.160
She did keep that diary, though,
and I can't find it. Has anyone found it?


425
00:38:41.234 --> 00:38:43.998
It's probably at her apartment
back in the city.


426
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.799
No, I looked there. 
I couldn't find it.

427
00:38:45.872 --> 00:38:50.104
It's probably for the best, you know. I mean,
I wouldn't want my mother to read my diary.


428
00:38:50.176 --> 00:38:53.202
- Sara didn't have anything to hide.
- Well, maybe I do.


429
00:38:54.748 --> 00:38:57.273
- Well?
- What's that supposed to mean?


430
00:38:58.385 --> 00:39:00.046
You're blushing.

431
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.155
- It must mean something.
- It's nothing.


432
00:39:03.223 --> 00:39:05.657
Why are you acting so guilty then?

433
00:39:05.859 --> 00:39:08.692
We kissed, okay? Sara and I.

434
00:39:08.762 --> 00:39:10.423
We fooled around in college.

435
00:39:10.497 --> 00:39:12.431
What? What do you mean?

436
00:39:13.066 --> 00:39:15.796
What part of "we fooled around"
don't you get?


437
00:39:15.869 --> 00:39:17.496
Did you have sex?

438
00:39:17.971 --> 00:39:20.963
I don't know. Why do you care?

439
00:39:21.274 --> 00:39:22.502
Did you?

440
00:39:23.977 --> 00:39:27.344
Listen, this was a long time
before I met you, Peter.


441
00:39:27.414 --> 00:39:30.941
It was early freshman year,
and we were really drunk.


442
00:39:31.017 --> 00:39:32.644
Did you have sex?

443
00:39:33.453 --> 00:39:34.715
Did you?

444
00:39:36.222 --> 00:39:38.850
- Why are you freaking out?
- You did.


445
00:39:39.692 --> 00:39:41.182
That's great.

446
00:39:41.428 --> 00:39:43.794
- You just got sand all over the baby.
- Great.


447
00:39:43.863 --> 00:39:45.296
Nice, Peter.

448
00:39:59.345 --> 00:40:02.041
- I'm sorry about your daughter.
- Thanks.


449
00:40:02.115 --> 00:40:04.276
You know, I lost
my brother three years ago.

450
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.580
I'm sorry. AIDS?

451
00:40:06.953 --> 00:40:08.011
No.

452
00:40:08.088 --> 00:40:09.350
- No?
- No.


453
00:40:10.423 --> 00:40:12.118
It's kind of ironic, actually.

454
00:40:12.192 --> 00:40:17.027
My stepmom had cancer,
and then he OD'd on her OxyContin.


455
00:40:17.664 --> 00:40:19.461
Oh, my God.

456
00:40:19.532 --> 00:40:22.262
And then she died. 
It's a whole mess.

457
00:40:23.136 --> 00:40:25.661
Needless to say,
I have a few commitment issues.


458
00:40:25.738 --> 00:40:27.569
But you and Adam are going steady.

459
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.540
What? What are you laughing about?

460
00:40:29.609 --> 00:40:32.134
- Going steady? No.
- No?


461
00:40:32.412 --> 00:40:34.209
No. I mean, you know, we're tight.

462
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.440
We're good for each other.
Especially in public.


463
00:40:36.515 --> 00:40:38.745
We're both talented, we're good-looking...

464
00:40:38.817 --> 00:40:41.786
he's famous, I'm an up-and-coming actor
with a lot of buzz.


465
00:40:41.854 --> 00:40:43.822
I just got a callback for Mamma Mia!

466
00:40:44.423 --> 00:40:46.050
Congratulations!

467
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:48.782
But you have commitment issues, huh?

468
00:40:49.294 --> 00:40:52.457
Shawn, do you sleep around?

469
00:40:57.202 --> 00:40:59.261
- What the... I get hit on more.
- Right.


470
00:40:59.338 --> 00:41:02.501
And I'm more sexual.
I'm more of a pig, actually.


471
00:41:03.108 --> 00:41:04.097
Really?

472
00:41:04.176 --> 00:41:06.940
And sometimes I just have to
take care of that, you know?


473
00:41:07.012 --> 00:41:08.639
- It's not cheating.
- Yeah.


474
00:41:08.714 --> 00:41:10.477
They're not even dates. 
It's just sex.

475
00:41:10.549 --> 00:41:12.517
No. I understand.

476
00:41:14.253 --> 00:41:17.086
You're not gonna tell Adam though,
are you?


477
00:41:17.689 --> 00:41:18.747
No.

478
00:41:18.824 --> 00:41:21.588
It'll be our little warm blanket, right?

479
00:41:22.161 --> 00:41:23.389
Come on.

480
00:41:25.197 --> 00:41:26.528
Hey, you.

481
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.462
- Did you have a nice chat?
- I love her.


482
00:41:36.408 --> 00:41:38.376
You're just being silly.

483
00:41:42.047 --> 00:41:43.036
Wow.

484
00:41:43.182 --> 00:41:44.649
That's mine.

485
00:41:45.584 --> 00:41:49.042
- Well, this is her diary, isn't it?
- Yeah, can I have it?


486
00:41:49.121 --> 00:41:51.612
The one her mother was looking for?

487
00:41:53.525 --> 00:41:55.686
Why didn't you say anything?

488
00:41:57.896 --> 00:42:00.956
- Well, are you going to give it to her?
- I don't know.


489
00:42:01.033 --> 00:42:04.002
Well, I think Sara would want me to have it,
don't you?


490
00:42:49.146 --> 00:42:50.374
Knew it.

491
00:42:50.448 --> 00:42:52.313
Out of cleaning supplies.

492
00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:56.980
I need to run an errand. 
Come on, let's go.

493
00:42:57.054 --> 00:42:58.351
Come on.

494
00:43:00.691 --> 00:43:03.888
You're pretty good with your baby.
Most men are terrified.


495
00:43:03.961 --> 00:43:06.088
Sara didn't tell me
you were a chauvinist, too.


496
00:43:06.163 --> 00:43:07.824
What did she say?

497
00:43:10.134 --> 00:43:12.864
Tell you what. 
Let's trade compliments.

498
00:43:13.104 --> 00:43:17.768
I'll tell you what she said about you
if you tell me what she said about me.


499
00:43:20.711 --> 00:43:23.202
She said you were always there for her.

500
00:43:23.281 --> 00:43:25.579
That wasn't so painful, was it?

501
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:26.844
Peter...

502
00:43:28.185 --> 00:43:31.052
I want to know everything
that happened between you and Sara.


503
00:43:31.122 --> 00:43:33.420
I want to know if you loved her.

504
00:43:33.491 --> 00:43:36.358
- That's none of your business.
- Yes, it is.


505
00:43:44.969 --> 00:43:48.029
Maddy had been in Chicago
for almost a month...


506
00:43:48.105 --> 00:43:49.629
on this case for her law firm.

507
00:43:50.908 --> 00:43:53.240
Sara invited me over for dinner.

508
00:43:53.611 --> 00:43:54.805
Sushi.

509
00:43:55.313 --> 00:43:57.713
The whole Japanese thing.

510
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.584
- She looked like a geisha.
- Yeah.


511
00:44:03.421 --> 00:44:05.048
I looked at her.

512
00:44:07.758 --> 00:44:09.419
And I kissed her.

513
00:44:10.861 --> 00:44:12.795
And she kissed me back.

514
00:44:16.634 --> 00:44:19.626
If we'd said anything,
nothing would have happened...


515
00:44:21.272 --> 00:44:23.263
but we didn't, so it did.

516
00:44:24.175 --> 00:44:25.301
Once.

517
00:44:25.676 --> 00:44:27.075
Don't worry.

518
00:44:27.378 --> 00:44:29.812
Peter, I would never tell Maddy.

519
00:44:30.014 --> 00:44:32.778
- She would never forgive me.
- She might.


520
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:37.585
And anyway, I'm not trying to threaten you.
It's just that...


521
00:44:38.422 --> 00:44:40.253
talking about Sara...

522
00:44:40.758 --> 00:44:43.886
it's the only way I
have of keeping her alive.

523
00:44:46.097 --> 00:44:47.928
I know what you mean.

524
00:44:48.899 --> 00:44:51.526
She said you had beautiful eyes...

525
00:44:53.136 --> 00:44:55.263
like little swimming pools.

526
00:44:55.739 --> 00:44:57.138
And you do.

527
00:44:58.708 --> 00:45:00.869
You know what else she said?

528
00:45:00.977 --> 00:45:03.502
No, you know what? 
I better not say that.

529
00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.275
What? No. Tell me.

530
00:45:08.451 --> 00:45:11.215
She said that you were thrilling in bed.

531
00:45:13.056 --> 00:45:15.047
She said that? 
She said thrilling?

532
00:45:15.125 --> 00:45:16.490
Oh, yeah.

533
00:46:30.567 --> 00:46:31.693
Natalie?

534
00:46:31.768 --> 00:46:34.532
- Peter, what's happening?
- What happened?


535
00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.440
Adam, what are you doing in here?

536
00:46:39.843 --> 00:46:41.174
He's sleepwalking again.

537
00:46:41.244 --> 00:46:43.303
What? I didn't know
people actually did that.


538
00:46:43.379 --> 00:46:46.940
- That's the baby.
- Okay. Adam, come back.


539
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.910
But I don't want
to go to the party.

540
00:46:53.923 --> 00:46:57.484
His producer's going to be at the party
tomorrow. He's nervous about it.


541
00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.392
Don't worry. It's going to be okay. Just...

542
00:47:01.697 --> 00:47:02.925
Wake up.

543
00:47:02.998 --> 00:47:04.966
He can stay. I'm up.

544
00:47:10.606 --> 00:47:15.339
Hey, Adam, is this for real
or are you just trying to scare her away?


545
00:47:15.644 --> 00:47:16.736
Who?

546
00:47:21.383 --> 00:47:22.748
Oh, honey.

547
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.854
Why don't you let
him play a little bit?

548
00:47:26.922 --> 00:47:29.482
I don't want him to get worked up.
He needs to sleep.


549
00:47:29.558 --> 00:47:32.618
Why can't he play?
Look at him. He's wide awake.


550
00:47:32.694 --> 00:47:35.891
Here, let me take him for a minute, okay?
You just let me take him.


551
00:47:35.964 --> 00:47:37.431
Let me take gorgeous.

552
00:47:38.267 --> 00:47:39.791
Hello, there.

553
00:47:40.168 --> 00:47:43.399
Look at this baby. 
Are you gorgeous?

554
00:47:43.672 --> 00:47:44.730
Hello there.

555
00:47:45.641 --> 00:47:47.768
You are special.

556
00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:49.873
You're special.

557
00:47:53.348 --> 00:47:55.043
You're so natural with him.

558
00:47:55.117 --> 00:47:57.847
I've had practice. Look at you.

559
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.150
Look at you, gorgeous.
What are you doing now?


560
00:48:00.222 --> 00:48:03.988
- Look at you, gorgeous little boy.
- Oh, God! I'm just so worried all the time...


561
00:48:04.059 --> 00:48:06.050
that something's going to happen to him,
you know...


562
00:48:06.128 --> 00:48:08.358
like I'm going to
drop him on his head.

563
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.160
Nothing is going to happen to him. Nothing.

564
00:48:11.233 --> 00:48:14.669
Dr. Blandish says you can
never let your child out of your sight.


565
00:48:14.736 --> 00:48:16.135
- Dr. Who?
- Blandish.


566
00:48:16.204 --> 00:48:17.899
I've been reading this book every day...

567
00:48:17.973 --> 00:48:21.875
and I just feel like I should practically
give Duncan away to foster parents...


568
00:48:21.944 --> 00:48:25.209
because something awful is gonna happen.
I just know it is.


569
00:48:25.414 --> 00:48:28.542
Okay, let me see this bible of motherhood.

570
00:48:29.685 --> 00:48:30.777
Okay.

571
00:48:31.153 --> 00:48:32.484
All right.

572
00:48:32.554 --> 00:48:34.215
What do you think, Duncan?

573
00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:35.654
Is this...

574
00:48:36.158 --> 00:48:41.118
the most ridiculous thing you have
ever seen in your whole entire life, huh?


575
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:43.996
She's just trying to
scare the crap out of young mothers.


576
00:48:44.066 --> 00:48:46.534
And frankly, you know what she's doing?
She's succeeding.


577
00:48:46.602 --> 00:48:47.933
You know what I think?

578
00:48:48.003 --> 00:48:50.870
Dr. Melanie Blandish
can just go save herself.


579
00:48:50.939 --> 00:48:52.167
That's right.

580
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.404
I mean, honey, if you want to learn
how to relax, just look at him. Enjoy him.


581
00:48:56.478 --> 00:49:00.642
For God sakes, just enjoy him.
This is the fun part.


582
00:49:00.716 --> 00:49:03.480
Look, swing him in the air.
Swing him in the air.


583
00:49:06.722 --> 00:49:08.712
I heard they get baby whiplash.

584
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:10.984
That is absurd. Now, here.

585
00:49:11.058 --> 00:49:14.186
I want you to take him.

586
00:49:14.895 --> 00:49:18.524
Take him.
Go on, take this beautiful treasure. Go on.


587
00:49:18.666 --> 00:49:20.896
Swing him in the air. 
Twirl him around.

588
00:49:20.968 --> 00:49:24.369
Come on, Maddy, you can do better
than that. Go on. Twirl him around.


589
00:49:24.438 --> 00:49:26.872
Yeah, that's it. 
That's what he loves.

590
00:49:34.749 --> 00:49:36.148
Is that fun?

591
00:49:42.523 --> 00:49:43.990
Mrs. Swerdlow...

592
00:49:45.793 --> 00:49:49.786
do you think Peter will forgive me
for keeping that secret from him?


593
00:49:49.864 --> 00:49:51.729
I think he just might.

594
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.892
Stop! Stop!

595
00:49:58.572 --> 00:50:00.472
Okay, put it down.

596
00:50:02.143 --> 00:50:03.337
Enough.

597
00:50:03.711 --> 00:50:05.076
Caught me.

598
00:50:05.179 --> 00:50:07.739
- Caught you what?
- Reading your play.


599
00:50:08.949 --> 00:50:11.713
My play? What, did
you go into my room?

600
00:50:12.019 --> 00:50:15.113
- I was cleaning it.
- Well, you had no right to do that.


601
00:50:15.189 --> 00:50:18.420
This one isn't as funny as the last one.
Is it supposed to be?


602
00:50:18.492 --> 00:50:20.858
Promise me you won't get too dark
all of a sudden.


603
00:50:20.928 --> 00:50:23.055
Don't get like Woody Allen did in Interiors.

604
00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:26.531
All serious and self-conscious
and trying to be a Scandinavian.


605
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.263
You wouldn't pull a Scandinavian number
on me, now, would you, Adam?


606
00:50:30.371 --> 00:50:31.599
Give it to me.

607
00:50:31.672 --> 00:50:34.197
And what's with the bearded lady character?

608
00:50:34.275 --> 00:50:36.709
Too weird.
I mean, you gotta cut the bearded lady.


609
00:50:36.777 --> 00:50:39.041
I happen to like the bearded lady.
Can I have it back?


610
00:50:39.113 --> 00:50:41.081
- I'm not finished.
- Well, I didn't say you could start.


611
00:50:41.148 --> 00:50:44.584
Well, if I had asked, you would have said no.
Come on, Adam.


612
00:50:44.652 --> 00:50:48.418
I promise to say three nice things
for every slightly negative comment.


613
00:50:48.489 --> 00:50:51.253
I mean, you want feedback, don't you?
It's overdue, isn't it?


614
00:50:51.325 --> 00:50:53.122
It's none of your business what it is.

615
00:50:53.194 --> 00:50:56.254
You can't just take something like that.
It's personal.


616
00:51:01.969 --> 00:51:04.403
This one's about my daughter, too.

617
00:51:29.429 --> 00:51:31.761
Yes, sing, Duncan. Help.

618
00:51:56.856 --> 00:51:58.448
What are you doing?

619
00:51:58.992 --> 00:52:02.621
Getting ready for the party.
We're still going, aren't we?


620
00:52:02.862 --> 00:52:04.955
Can I talk to you for a minute?

621
00:52:05.165 --> 00:52:06.393
Shawn!

622
00:52:13.873 --> 00:52:16.273
- Hey! Watch it.
- We are not going.


623
00:52:16.376 --> 00:52:19.311
Look, I'm not going in drag. Relax.
I was just trying to cheer her up.


624
00:52:19.379 --> 00:52:20.573
It's Sara's. You going to rip it.

625
00:52:20.647 --> 00:52:22.808
It's not even zipped,
and besides, Natalie might wear it.


626
00:52:22.882 --> 00:52:26.045
- What? She thinks she's coming?
- Yeah. Why shouldn't she?


627
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:32.981
How do I look?

628
00:52:41.501 --> 00:52:45.699
- Are there going to be any celebrities here?
- Like the pages of Vanity Fair.


629
00:52:45.772 --> 00:52:48.263
- I can't do this.
- You can and you must.


630
00:52:48.341 --> 00:52:51.538
No, you don't understand.
The only reason why Mel invited me...


631
00:52:51.611 --> 00:52:54.739
me, not my tag-along posse,
was to schmooze the money people.


632
00:52:54.814 --> 00:52:58.375
- My backers are throwing this party.
- Then go home.


633
00:52:58.685 --> 00:53:00.016
I need a drink.

634
00:53:00.086 --> 00:53:03.578
What am I gonna tell him, you know?
I can't write anymore? My muse is dead?


635
00:53:03.656 --> 00:53:07.057
Sara was the only person in the world
that I trusted to tell me what was funny.


636
00:53:07.126 --> 00:53:09.356
Who am I going
to be funny for now?

637
00:53:09.429 --> 00:53:11.397
You can be funny for me.

638
00:53:24.276 --> 00:53:26.574
Don't mind if I do. 
Thank you so much.

639
00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:32.678
Cheers.

640
00:53:38.557 --> 00:53:42.789
And the limestone comes
from Michelangelo's quarry...


641
00:53:42.861 --> 00:53:44.692
Could you excuse me for just a minute?

642
00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.290
Do I know you?

643
00:53:50.602 --> 00:53:52.763
I'm with Adam Goldman. 
I'm his guest.

644
00:53:52.838 --> 00:53:55.773
You came with Adam.
I produced his first play.


645
00:53:55.841 --> 00:53:59.277
It was a hit, very funny. 
And funny is money.

646
00:53:59.344 --> 00:54:00.333
Hi, Mel.

647
00:54:00.746 --> 00:54:04.307
You brought the whole household, I see.
So are you all staying at the house?


648
00:54:04.383 --> 00:54:05.543
I'm Mel Wolf.

649
00:54:05.617 --> 00:54:08.085
I'm sorry, this is Natalie. 
Mel's my producer.

650
00:54:08.153 --> 00:54:10.121
- Nice to meet you.
- Mr. Wolf.


651
00:54:10.489 --> 00:54:13.583
Shawn Hudson. So nice to meet you, finally.

652
00:54:13.825 --> 00:54:17.317
This is such a big deal for me.
I love your work.


653
00:54:17.763 --> 00:54:19.890
And I also happen to be
kind of a great actor...


654
00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:21.762
And a singer, too.

655
00:54:21.934 --> 00:54:24.061
- Well...
- He sings. Is there a piano?


656
00:54:24.136 --> 00:54:25.569
- Please stop.
- He would love to sing for you.


657
00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:28.572
- No, I couldn't do that.
- Really.


658
00:54:28.774 --> 00:54:31.038
He sings and plays the piano so beautifully.

659
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:32.974
He got a callback for Mamma Mia!

660
00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:34.609
- The road tour.
- Wow.


661
00:54:35.247 --> 00:54:38.944
Natalie, are you a local? These don't seem
like your brand of ruffians.


662
00:54:39.017 --> 00:54:40.746
No, I'm just the den mother.

663
00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:42.878
You must've had them in elementary school.

664
00:54:43.555 --> 00:54:45.921
Well, it's not the years, Mel. 
It's the mileage.

665
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:47.390
Natalie's Sara's mother.

666
00:54:50.262 --> 00:54:53.060
- I'm so sorry.
- No, that's okay. It's just...


667
00:54:53.265 --> 00:54:56.826
Excuse me, I need a refill.
And listen, really, I want you to sing for him.


668
00:54:56.902 --> 00:54:58.836
- No, I couldn't do that.
- Yes. You'll love it.


669
00:54:58.904 --> 00:55:00.531
- The Wandering Minstrel?
- Yes.


670
00:55:06.111 --> 00:55:08.238
Did I make an
ass of myself, or what?

671
00:55:12.484 --> 00:55:14.145
You want to make contact
with Melvin Wolf...


672
00:55:14.219 --> 00:55:16.517
so that he'll cast you
in one of his Broadway musicals?


673
00:55:16.588 --> 00:55:19.887
- Would that be so bad?
- Yes. Actually, it's highly inappropriate.


674
00:55:19.958 --> 00:55:22.859
- He was just trying to introduce himself.
- Excuse me.


675
00:55:22.928 --> 00:55:25.328
You're not his agent,
and you're not his mother.


676
00:55:25.397 --> 00:55:27.695
You know what? 
Like I need your producer.

677
00:55:27.766 --> 00:55:29.461
And what were you saying to Mel?

678
00:55:29.534 --> 00:55:31.694
Were you sabotaging my next play?

679
00:55:31.769 --> 00:55:33.066
You know, now that Sara's gone...

680
00:55:33.137 --> 00:55:35.765
maybe you should try
focusing on your personal life.


681
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.308
She was my personal life.
She was everything to me.


682
00:55:38.376 --> 00:55:42.335
To the exclusion of all others.
To the exclusion of your friend Shawn.


683
00:55:42.413 --> 00:55:44.210
Yes, I get it.

684
00:55:44.315 --> 00:55:47.113
And maybe that's why
he's sleeping around on you.


685
00:55:48.085 --> 00:55:49.177
Sorry.

686
00:55:49.253 --> 00:55:51.517
The hostess said
I could change Duncan in here.


687
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:53.716
- Where is everybody?
- Out on the terrace.


688
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:57.158
Shawn brought Sara's mushrooms
and they're going to get high.


689
00:55:57.995 --> 00:55:59.519
Sara's mushrooms?

690
00:56:00.531 --> 00:56:03.364
You know. Mushrooms.
Shrooms. Mushrooms...


691
00:56:03.434 --> 00:56:06.528
- Maddy?
- You know, like hallucinogens.


692
00:56:06.937 --> 00:56:09.098
Like LSD, but they're natural.

693
00:56:09.173 --> 00:56:10.640
I don't do them anymore.

694
00:56:10.708 --> 00:56:11.936
Last time I did them...

695
00:56:12.009 --> 00:56:15.172
I saw my dead grandparents
and Abraham Lincoln...


696
00:56:15.679 --> 00:56:17.442
and then puked for four hours.

697
00:56:17.515 --> 00:56:21.474
- Sara brought them? They were Sara's?
- Yeah, she brought them to the house.


698
00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.112
- Looking good?
- Yeah.


699
00:56:30.995 --> 00:56:32.895
- She wants to try mushrooms.
- What?


700
00:56:32.963 --> 00:56:34.260
- No way.
- Yes.


701
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:35.423
Are you serious?

702
00:56:35.499 --> 00:56:37.228
She's been looking
for you guys everywhere.


703
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:39.235
There's enough to go around.
I don't see why not.


704
00:56:39.303 --> 00:56:41.464
What's wrong with you people, huh?

705
00:56:41.539 --> 00:56:43.302
Why would you give mushrooms
to that woman?


706
00:56:43.374 --> 00:56:45.899
She's not "that woman."
She's Mrs. Swerdlow.


707
00:56:45.976 --> 00:56:49.776
- You guys, she's hoping to see Sara.
- I think it's only fair we let her try, right?


708
00:56:49.847 --> 00:56:53.214
- Why? Do you have a problem with that?
- Yes, I got a problem with that.


709
00:56:53.284 --> 00:56:55.912
And so do the rest of us.
She's not our friend.


710
00:56:55.986 --> 00:56:57.783
She's Sara's mom. 
She's a grownup.

711
00:56:57.855 --> 00:57:00.346
Yeah, so are you,
or at least you're supposed to be.


712
00:57:00.424 --> 00:57:02.984
If thirty isn't grown-up, what is?
Forty? Ninety?


713
00:57:05.196 --> 00:57:08.597
- Where are the mushrooms? I want one.
- Knock yourself out, Natalie.


714
00:57:09.366 --> 00:57:10.560
I will.

715
00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:12.831
Enjoy.

716
00:58:07.824 --> 00:58:10.520
Excuse me, aren't you Adam Goldman?

717
00:58:10.593 --> 00:58:12.220
The gay Neil Simon?

718
00:58:12.295 --> 00:58:14.957
We just wanted to tell you
how much we love your work.


719
00:58:15.031 --> 00:58:16.225
Okay.

720
00:58:16.299 --> 00:58:18.199
Come and dance. Come on.

721
00:59:02.879 --> 00:59:04.642
Oh, God.

722
00:59:06.182 --> 00:59:07.706
Look up there.

723
00:59:09.185 --> 00:59:13.679
It's like it's skywriting in the clouds.

724
00:59:25.235 --> 00:59:26.998
Surrender, Dorothy.

725
00:59:29.138 --> 00:59:30.400
Surrender, Dorothy.

726
00:59:50.626 --> 00:59:52.526
Can you see it, Peter?

727
00:59:54.796 --> 00:59:59.233
It says "Surrender Dorothy" in the sky.

728
01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:05.204
That's from The Wizard of Oz, right?

729
01:00:06.208 --> 01:00:08.108
I don't get it. What is it?

730
01:00:08.176 --> 01:00:09.939
That was our movie.

731
01:00:11.113 --> 01:00:12.978
That was our greeting.

732
01:00:15.384 --> 01:00:18.911
- I don't see it.
- It's there.


733
01:00:21.023 --> 01:00:22.752
Surrender, Dorothy.

734
01:00:29.197 --> 01:00:31.995
- I think it's the drugs, Mrs. Swerdlow.
- No.


735
01:00:32.601 --> 01:00:35.161
No, it's not. It's...

736
01:00:38.206 --> 01:00:39.468
You see?

737
01:00:40.242 --> 01:00:41.766
Can't you see?

738
01:00:42.444 --> 01:00:43.502
No.

739
01:00:47.115 --> 01:00:50.812
No. It just went away like...

740
01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:54.814
It's not there anymore.

741
01:01:36.465 --> 01:01:37.727
To Sara.

742
01:01:38.567 --> 01:01:39.864
To Sara.

743
01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:52.310
Where is the bus stop?

744
01:01:57.418 --> 01:01:59.579
Do you know what time it is?

745
01:02:05.192 --> 01:02:06.181
Do you like...

746
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.421
How can you go along with this?

747
01:02:08.496 --> 01:02:10.589
We're just trying to remember her, Adam.

748
01:02:10.664 --> 01:02:12.529
No, you're not. 
You're making fun of her.

749
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.830
- Hey.
- Hey, you're just tripping, guy.


750
01:02:14.902 --> 01:02:16.631
You're so paranoid.

751
01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:19.329
This is so desperate.

752
01:02:19.707 --> 01:02:21.868
You don't even know these people.

753
01:02:21.942 --> 01:02:25.139
I don't even know these people
like I thought I did.


754
01:02:25.212 --> 01:02:27.305
What's that supposed to mean?

755
01:02:27.982 --> 01:02:29.779
Adam, stop it!

756
01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:32.278
- Stop it, Adam.
- Calm down.


757
01:02:32.887 --> 01:02:35.515
- Stop it, Adam.
- Stop it, Adam.


758
01:02:36.624 --> 01:02:37.784
Peter!

759
01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.118
- You guys, come on.
- Get off of him.


760
01:02:41.195 --> 01:02:42.457
Adam.

761
01:02:42.763 --> 01:02:44.628
Turn down the noise!

762
01:02:44.698 --> 01:02:46.962
This is a family neighborhood.

763
01:02:48.736 --> 01:02:49.964
Adam! Hey, Adam.

764
01:02:50.037 --> 01:02:52.471
I wonder if Mrs. Moyles
knows who she's renting to.


765
01:02:52.907 --> 01:02:54.101
Sorry.

766
01:02:54.275 --> 01:02:55.799
Summer people.

767
01:03:23.003 --> 01:03:24.368
Sara.

768
01:03:25.239 --> 01:03:26.900
Sara!

769
01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:28.933
Okay.

770
01:03:32.947 --> 01:03:34.744
- Hey.
- Wait, there.


771
01:03:35.149 --> 01:03:36.673
- Natalie.
- Yes.


772
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:39.148
- I know you...
- What?


773
01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:43.047
I know you asked me
if I was in love with Sara.


774
01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:49.891
I think you had this idea
that we had some big romantic thing...


775
01:03:50.698 --> 01:03:52.188
but it wasn't.

776
01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:56.465
- It was desperate and stupid.
- That's not what she said.


777
01:03:57.271 --> 01:03:59.796
Well, it was. We were drunk.

778
01:04:00.374 --> 01:04:03.810
It was over before it started.
We both felt like crap.


779
01:04:04.211 --> 01:04:06.337
And then when
she found out she was pregnant...


780
01:04:06.412 --> 01:04:07.743
Excuse me?

781
01:04:09.816 --> 01:04:11.647
Did you say pregnant?

782
01:04:14.888 --> 01:04:18.119
You didn't know. I'm sorry.
I thought she would've told you.


783
01:04:18.191 --> 01:04:19.658
Hey, it's okay, guy.

784
01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.985
Did she have an abortion?

785
01:04:25.298 --> 01:04:26.458
Okay.

786
01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:29.526
- I paid for it.
- That was very noble of you, Peter.


787
01:04:29.602 --> 01:04:33.265
We never talked about it again, okay?
It was like it never happened.


788
01:04:33.339 --> 01:04:36.502
- Were you with her? Did you go with her?
- She wouldn't let me.


789
01:04:36.576 --> 01:04:39.101
You mean, she went alone?

790
01:04:39.679 --> 01:04:40.873
God!

791
01:04:44.284 --> 01:04:49.017
Sweetie, I'm sorry. 
I'm so, so sorry.

792
01:04:56.563 --> 01:05:00.021
Don't cry. Don't cry, sweet baby.

793
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.194
Don't cry, little Duncan, my boy.

794
01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:05.535
I'm sorry.

795
01:05:07.707 --> 01:05:09.197
Did you know?

796
01:05:09.275 --> 01:05:10.469
Are you okay?

797
01:05:10.543 --> 01:05:13.444
No. She never said anything about Peter.

798
01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:15.304
Maddy, no.

799
01:05:15.548 --> 01:05:17.641
But you knew about the abortion?

800
01:05:17.717 --> 01:05:19.241
I did, but...

801
01:05:20.253 --> 01:05:21.618
I'm sorry.

802
01:05:22.755 --> 01:05:25.849
I didn't know the details, I swear.

803
01:05:26.125 --> 01:05:28.252
Would you have told me if you had?

804
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:30.192
If I knew about Peter?

805
01:05:34.767 --> 01:05:35.791
No.

806
01:05:37.236 --> 01:05:40.137
I don't think so. I'm sorry.

807
01:05:40.206 --> 01:05:42.174
No. Of course not.

808
01:05:42.909 --> 01:05:45.434
Of course you wouldn't have told me...

809
01:05:46.512 --> 01:05:50.073
because you and I,
we're not really friends, are we, Adam?


810
01:05:50.149 --> 01:05:52.743
I mean, not really.

811
01:05:52.819 --> 01:05:56.050
Look, I didn't know. 
I swear to God.

812
01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:05.624
What?

813
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.900
What, what's going on?

814
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.630
What did I miss?

815
01:06:12.804 --> 01:06:14.499
What did you miss?

816
01:06:15.674 --> 01:06:16.800
Yeah.

817
01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:18.365
Sweetheart...

818
01:06:19.578 --> 01:06:21.170
What did you miss?

819
01:06:23.048 --> 01:06:25.073
You missed this, you ass!

820
01:06:26.418 --> 01:06:28.147
You slept with her?

821
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.212
You had sex with my best friend
and you got her pregnant?


822
01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:32.347
Maddy.

823
01:06:32.424 --> 01:06:34.915
- And she had an abortion?
- Maddy.


824
01:06:35.327 --> 01:06:38.421
Stay out of this, Adam.
You just stay out of it.


825
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:41.363
None of us would be here right now
if it weren't for Sara, okay?


826
01:06:41.433 --> 01:06:43.367
So just stay out of it.

827
01:06:43.835 --> 01:06:48.238
And I swear to God if any of this
ends up in that stupid little play of yours...


828
01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.240
We both slept with her.

829
01:06:50.575 --> 01:06:51.803
So what?

830
01:06:53.979 --> 01:06:57.073
Stupid. I wasn't married then.

831
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:59.146
I hadn't met you yet.

832
01:06:59.751 --> 01:07:01.412
You stupid idiot!

833
01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:06.551
Don't follow me!

834
01:07:13.999 --> 01:07:16.729
She just had to
have it all, didn't she?

835
01:07:16.868 --> 01:07:19.735
She just had to cross
Peter right off her list.

836
01:07:19.805 --> 01:07:21.397
- What?
- Sara!


837
01:07:22.874 --> 01:07:26.105
- Maddy.
- She had to have something on everyone...


838
01:07:26.311 --> 01:07:28.677
just so you couldn't go too far away.

839
01:07:28.747 --> 01:07:31.614
- Maddy, I...
- Give him to me.


840
01:07:32.918 --> 01:07:34.476
Give him to me.

841
01:07:36.555 --> 01:07:39.524
She always had to
have all of the attention.

842
01:07:39.991 --> 01:07:43.586
And I'm not surprised,
because like mother, like daughter.


843
01:07:46.865 --> 01:07:49.527
So that's it? You
just get to drive away?

844
01:07:49.601 --> 01:07:51.694
What do you think?
"I'm sorry" is gonna do it?


845
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:54.034
Well, I didn't apologize, did I? Did I?

846
01:07:56.775 --> 01:08:00.233
Okay, look, I am sorry, Maddy.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Okay?


847
01:08:00.312 --> 01:08:03.076
Don't do this. Maddy. Maddy!

848
01:08:24.802 --> 01:08:26.360
There you are.

849
01:08:32.977 --> 01:08:34.137
Hello.

850
01:08:34.812 --> 01:08:36.302
Hello. God.

851
01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:42.781
- I'm sorry. I got you all wet.
- It's all right. Now I'm baptized.


852
01:08:54.865 --> 01:08:56.696
So, you here to
crack the whip on Adam?

853
01:08:56.767 --> 01:09:00.533
Well, actually my motives
are entirely duplicitous.


854
01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:02.003
How refreshing.

855
01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.799
I want to take you out to dinner.

856
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:07.334
That's very sweet of you.

857
01:09:08.212 --> 01:09:10.703
I'm not quite ready. 
Thank you, though.

858
01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:21.781
So, tell me. What's the new play about?

859
01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:23.918
Inquiring minds want to know.

860
01:09:23.994 --> 01:09:26.428
- Death.
- You're trying to kill me, is that it?


861
01:09:26.497 --> 01:09:29.364
Because you know, I went for
a stress test last week, and I failed it.


862
01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:31.924
So your death play
better have a little humor attached to it.


863
01:09:32.002 --> 01:09:33.264
It will.

864
01:09:35.206 --> 01:09:38.403
He gave you his head shot?
What's he gonna do, sleep with you next?


865
01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:41.967
He's an actor, buddy. Don't worry about it.
I'll give it to my casting director.


866
01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:43.673
Do you know what
his claim to fame is?

867
01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:46.238
He understudied the fork
in Beauty and the Beast.


868
01:09:46.317 --> 01:09:47.648
He's using me to get to you.

869
01:09:47.718 --> 01:09:50.915
Adam, it's no big deal. 
I get this all the time.

870
01:09:57.261 --> 01:09:59.354
You gave this to him
without my permission.


871
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:01.330
Without your permission?

872
01:10:01.999 --> 01:10:05.491
You do not tell me what I can
and cannot do, all right?


873
01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:08.367
No, Shawn, actually, it's not all right.

874
01:10:08.706 --> 01:10:10.333
Someone needs to.

875
01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:13.440
What is the problem now?

876
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:16.343
The problem is that
I am not a fan of being used.


877
01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:17.937
Just calm down, Adam.

878
01:10:18.749 --> 01:10:21.513
- This is a very cute picture.
- Don't tell me to calm down.


879
01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:23.849
- You do not know what's going on.
- Yes, I do.


880
01:10:23.921 --> 01:10:27.084
- You're having a melodramatic snit fit.
- Melodramatic?


881
01:10:27.157 --> 01:10:30.751
Please. I'm not the one going around
having séances for my dead daughter.


882
01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:33.261
- I'm in mourning. I'm grieving.
- We're all grieving.


883
01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:36.821
No, I'm sorry, Adam. It's not the same.
I'm the mother and you're not even family.


884
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.529
- What, I'm just the friend?
- No, you're just the thief is what you are.


885
01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:43.868
Sara never even had a boyfriend
that lasted six months...


886
01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.171
because what man in his right mind
would stick around...


887
01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.507
with some fairy
mincing around in the background.


888
01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:50.978
If you really truly loved her...

889
01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:52.514
Are you mad at me
because I didn't sleep with her?


890
01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:56.416
She wanted to have kids,
and she wanted to be married.


891
01:10:56.486 --> 01:11:00.354
No, she did not. That stuff scared her
to death, and I wonder why.


892
01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:03.119
No. She could've been with somebody...

893
01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:06.389
and she might've kept that baby
if it weren't for you.


894
01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:09.488
- You probably talked her into it.
- I talked her into nothing.


895
01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:13.296
All I did was take her to the doctor,
I took her home, I put her in her bed.


896
01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:16.304
She came to me, 
Natalie, do you see?

897
01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.602
She came to me.

898
01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:22.809
Nobody asked you here. Why did you come?
What are you doing here?


899
01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:26.371
I had to see
where my little girl wasted her time.


900
01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:30.515
This disgusting house
and you ridiculous kids.


901
01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:33.749
Sitting around getting drunk,
pretending like you're still in college.


902
01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:35.313
She'd still be alive!

903
01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:40.158
She never would've gotten in that car
if she had any other decent place to be.


904
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:42.390
But she had nothing.

905
01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:43.989
She had you!

906
01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:46.831
So we didn't have the little
"Surrender, Dorothy" shtick.


907
01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:48.700
Does that mean I
don't get to feel anything?

908
01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:51.706
Look, I understand it's the hardest thing
in the world to lose a child.


909
01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.537
Don't give me your platitudes.

910
01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:56.476
You don't know anything
about losing a child.


911
01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:58.844
You're right. I didn't lose a child.

912
01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:02.043
But I lost the most important person
in my life.


913
01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.309
Are you just about done?

914
01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.580
Leave.

915
01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:09.016
- Just leave.
- I am not going anywhere!


916
01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:38.686
Did Natalie say something about me?
About us?


917
01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:40.715
Of course she did.

918
01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.814
She's like a neutron bomb.

919
01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.493
Wipe out the people,
and leave all the buildings.


920
01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:47.288
Look.

921
01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:50.354
I want to be here for you
but I can't do that if you continue...


922
01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:53.230
- Then stop sleeping around.
- Well, I'll stop sleeping around...


923
01:12:53.301 --> 01:12:57.135
if you start showing some passing interest
in my inner life.


924
01:12:57.205 --> 01:12:58.638
I show passing interest.

925
01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:03.201
Look, I know I'm not
a Japanese PhD scholar, all right, but...


926
01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:07.070
Well, I am in analysis twice a week.

927
01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:11.782
I want what you had with Sara.

928
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:17.014
I want you to write for me.

929
01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:20.326
I want you to be funny for me.

930
01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.963
Adam. Adam, get down. Adam, please.

931
01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:30.630
Adam, let's talk about this inside.
You've made your point.


932
01:13:30.705 --> 01:13:32.764
Adam, the roof isn't safe.

933
01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:35.374
Would you... Adam!

934
01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:36.466
Adam?

935
01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:55.528
- She's snoring.
- She's sleeping.


936
01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:57.154
She hates me.

937
01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.361
Oh, my God!

938
01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:33.557
Thank you, whoever found it.

939
01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:51.043
It's in Japanese?

940
01:14:58.259 --> 01:14:59.590
Okay, so...

941
01:15:01.996 --> 01:15:03.395
Any method?

942
01:15:12.706 --> 01:15:14.071
You hungry?

943
01:16:18.606 --> 01:16:20.506
Maddy, I am so sorry.

944
01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.540
I am so sorry.

945
01:16:24.478 --> 01:16:26.412
I love you so much.

946
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.415
You have to know
I only ever loved you.

947
01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.779
We love each other, right?

948
01:16:36.523 --> 01:16:38.491
I just want to love you.

949
01:17:03.216 --> 01:17:05.081
You been married a lot?

950
01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:06.978
No, just the twice.

951
01:17:07.754 --> 01:17:09.915
- You like being single?
- Like?


952
01:17:10.056 --> 01:17:12.456
I tolerate it. I like...

953
01:17:13.893 --> 01:17:16.623
I like to be around people.
I like to know about them.


954
01:17:16.696 --> 01:17:19.358
I guess that's why I do what I do.
Anyway, what do you do?


955
01:17:19.432 --> 01:17:21.798
- I'm a travel agent.
- You like to travel?


956
01:17:21.868 --> 01:17:23.893
- I like to get there.
- Here you are.


957
01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.096
Yeah.

958
01:17:26.205 --> 01:17:27.934
Excuse me. Hi.

959
01:17:28.741 --> 01:17:30.333
Do you speak Japanese?

960
01:17:31.210 --> 01:17:34.236
Well, could you read this, please?

961
01:17:34.781 --> 01:17:38.512
It's my daughter's
and I can't make heads or tails out of it.


962
01:17:38.718 --> 01:17:41.278
Would you just look at it? Thank you.

963
01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:46.986
This is personal.

964
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.857
That's okay. She won't mind.

965
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:52.754
It is very personal. Not polite.

966
01:17:53.066 --> 01:17:55.432
What do you mean?
It's like erotic or something?


967
01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:56.729
Steamy. Yes.

968
01:17:56.836 --> 01:18:00.772
Well, is there some part
that you could read that isn't steamy?


969
01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.108
It's her diary, Natalie. She probably
put it in Japanese so you couldn't read it.


970
01:18:05.178 --> 01:18:07.339
Well, I outfoxed her, didn't I?

971
01:18:10.883 --> 01:18:12.544
"I cannot breathe.

972
01:18:13.219 --> 01:18:16.347
"I know the right thing,
but I cannot do it.

973
01:18:17.657 --> 01:18:19.420
"I should run away.

974
01:18:20.693 --> 01:18:24.823
"I should leave her,
but that would be cruel.

975
01:18:26.232 --> 01:18:29.895
"It's terrible, but I sometimes think...

976
01:18:30.636 --> 01:18:33.127
"my only way that I will grow up...

977
01:18:33.573 --> 01:18:36.201
"is when my mother is dead.

978
01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:40.470
"Then I won't have to listen to her.

979
01:18:41.547 --> 01:18:43.879
"I won't have to confide in her.

980
01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:46.812
"I could maybe be myself.

981
01:18:48.254 --> 01:18:52.213
"Instead, I hear her wherever I go.

982
01:18:53.459 --> 01:18:55.256
"I can't escape her.

983
01:18:55.528 --> 01:18:57.553
"Please let me go, Mother.

984
01:18:58.331 --> 01:19:00.458
- "Let me try on my own."
- Stop!


985
01:19:03.635 --> 01:19:05.068
Natalie?

986
01:19:54.986 --> 01:19:56.647
You want to order?

987
01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:00.116
Lady?

988
01:20:03.195 --> 01:20:05.959
Small cup of vanilla, please.

989
01:20:06.465 --> 01:20:07.727
Ninety-eight cents.

990
01:20:14.039 --> 01:20:16.269
My daughter used to come here.

991
01:20:17.175 --> 01:20:19.609
She came here the night she died.

992
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.914
She was in an accident.
Maybe you remember her?


993
01:20:29.287 --> 01:20:31.755
She was very pretty and she was...

994
01:20:33.592 --> 01:20:35.150
my little girl.

995
01:20:35.727 --> 01:20:38.560
This was the last
place that she came to.

996
01:20:40.632 --> 01:20:42.065
This was it.

997
01:20:44.302 --> 01:20:47.066
She came here with her boyfriend, right?

998
01:20:49.174 --> 01:20:52.075
No, not her boyfriend, but her best friend.

999
01:20:55.113 --> 01:20:57.206
Could I ask you a question?

1000
01:21:02.153 --> 01:21:04.485
Did she seem happy then?

1001
01:21:06.691 --> 01:21:09.989
She did. They both did.

1002
01:21:12.129 --> 01:21:13.460
Thank you.

1003
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.789
Thank you.

1004
01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:34.312
Peter...

1005
01:21:35.953 --> 01:21:37.545
I think that...

1006
01:21:39.657 --> 01:21:42.387
- I think this is what you wanted?
- Yeah. Thank you.


1007
01:21:42.459 --> 01:21:43.585
Oh, my God.

1008
01:21:43.661 --> 01:21:47.358
And, Maddy, this is for Duncan.

1009
01:21:47.765 --> 01:21:49.960
The real bible of motherhood.

1010
01:21:50.367 --> 01:21:52.767
Thank you so much. 
This is great.

1011
01:21:56.874 --> 01:21:58.068
- Shawn...
- No.


1012
01:21:58.142 --> 01:22:00.610
- Just in case you do The Mikado...
- Natalie, put it away.


1013
01:22:00.678 --> 01:22:02.202
- At Lincoln Center.
- Thank you.


1014
01:22:04.882 --> 01:22:06.179
It's beautiful.

1015
01:22:08.252 --> 01:22:11.153
I guess there's nothing
in that bag for me.

1016
01:22:12.289 --> 01:22:15.156
- Take him. Let's go. I'll load the truck.
- Well.


1017
01:22:25.002 --> 01:22:26.333
- No.
- Yes.


1018
01:22:29.039 --> 01:22:31.803
I hope you can use
it for your new play.

1019
01:22:36.814 --> 01:22:37.974
Adam...

1020
01:22:39.383 --> 01:22:40.850
I'm so sorry.

1021
01:22:42.219 --> 01:22:45.382
I'm really sorry
that I wanted her all to myself.


1022
01:22:45.689 --> 01:22:47.884
I'm sorry that she hurt you.

1023
01:22:48.525 --> 01:22:50.322
She never did, ever.

1024
01:22:51.095 --> 01:22:53.086
She left you, didn't she?

1025
01:22:53.597 --> 01:22:55.360
She left all of us.

1026
01:22:55.766 --> 01:22:59.702
She didn't mean to, though.
She really didn't mean to, sweetie.


1027
01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:03.171
She was just a fragile little girl.

1028
01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:13.678
She was the only thing I ever loved
in my whole life.


1029
01:23:14.985 --> 01:23:16.213
Me, too.

1030
01:23:20.423 --> 01:23:21.617
I know.

1031
01:23:30.633 --> 01:23:32.863
So what are you going to do now?

1032
01:23:32.935 --> 01:23:36.871
I was thinking I might
take some time off and go to Japan...


1033
01:23:36.939 --> 01:23:38.770
but I don't think so.

1034
01:23:42.578 --> 01:23:43.977
I think...

1035
01:23:44.614 --> 01:23:49.347
I should let Sara have some place
all to herself, don't you think?


1036
01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:51.912
Yes.

1037
01:23:53.389 --> 01:23:54.549
Yeah.

1038
01:23:55.558 --> 01:23:59.551
But for now, I have to go home.

1039
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:18.608
Got it.

1040
01:24:19.615 --> 01:24:20.809
Ready!

1041
01:24:22.852 --> 01:24:25.286
- I'll be back.
- We'll all be back.


1042
01:24:25.521 --> 01:24:28.820
After The Wizard of Oz one night,
when Sara was seven...


1043
01:24:28.891 --> 01:24:29.880
she asked me...

1044
01:24:29.992 --> 01:24:33.723
what I thought it was like for the Lion,
the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow...


1045
01:24:34.197 --> 01:24:37.928
after Dorothy left them in Oz
and went back home to Kansas.


1046
01:24:38.434 --> 01:24:40.026
Did they miss her?

1047
01:24:40.103 --> 01:24:41.934
Could they really be happy?

1048
01:24:42.004 --> 01:24:44.734
How could they face
the rest of their lives knowing...


1049
01:24:44.807 --> 01:24:47.173
they'd never see her again?

1050
01:24:48.211 --> 01:24:51.180
I explained to her
that Dorothy was a gift...

1051
01:24:52.615 --> 01:24:54.173
that they knew that...

1052
01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:58.016
and that they had to keep her alive
in their heads and hearts...


1053
01:24:58.221 --> 01:25:01.622
and face their futures
with newly-found courage.


1054
01:25:03.025 --> 01:25:05.892
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark


1055
01:25:06.028 --> 01:25:07.723
You're out of the night

1056
01:25:08.965 --> 01:25:12.765
Step into the sun
Step into the light


1057
01:25:13.603 --> 01:25:18.597
Keep straight ahead
for the most glorious place


1058
01:25:18.741 --> 01:25:22.837
On the face of the earth
or the sky


1059
01:25:24.013 --> 01:25:27.209
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart


1060
01:25:27.282 --> 01:25:29.409
Hold on to your hope

1061
01:25:29.985 --> 01:25:33.216
March up to that gate
and bid it...


1062
01:25:33.622 --> 01:25:35.146
open.
