1
00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.512
- He threw a
pan in my direction.


2
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:28.713
And then he said,

3
00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:32.044
"This is why they don't
let women in kitchens."


4
00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:33.980
- He told me
if I sat on his lap,


5
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:35.718
he'd buy a lot of wine for me.

6
00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:36.953
- He pulled me in his office

7
00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:40.756
and without knowing
anything about me he said,


8
00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:42.593
"If you're gonna get
emotional about this,


9
00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:44.661
"you're not gonna
work here anymore."


10
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.794
- I had this group of men

11
00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:47.129
that I was taking care of.

12
00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:52.130
They said, "How much would
it cost to take you home?"


13
00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:54.309
- He told me
to make sure I dressed


14
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.872
and spoke appropriately
at the event.


15
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:00.006
- He said, "I
didn't realize a girl


16
00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:03.306
"that looked like you would
know something about food."


17
00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.309
- I arrived at
an event to work a party


18
00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:08.718
that was predominantly male.

19
00:01:08.787 --> 00:01:11.215
And I searched for
my manager on duty


20
00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:13.987
to ask for any specific
instruction or direction.


21
00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:17.155
And the manager who was
also male said to me,


22
00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:18.827
"Oh you know, just flirt.

23
00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:20.862
"Just do that thing
that you girls do."


24
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:22.230
- I was crouched down

25
00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.295
in front of another chef taking
a group photo at an event.


26
00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:27.572
And when I stand
up, he says to me,


27
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:29.937
"Whoops, I think I
just got you pregnant."


28
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.972
- It was always expected
that when I would walk


29
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.974
into any new kitchen
for the first time,


30
00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:38.583
I would get hard stares,
whistleblows, sexual comments


31
00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:41.080
and then it became a
part of the lifestyle.


32
00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.917
And I just learned
to get used to it.


33
00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:45.348
- I remember the first
time doning a chef coat


34
00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.020
and what honor it
felt to wear it.


35
00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:49.187
And then the chef saying to me

36
00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:52.157
how I was not
as cute as I was

37
00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:54.632
in my regular front
of the house outfit.


38
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:56.700
- I remember once going
on a job interview


39
00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:59.329
for a pastry chef
position in New York


40
00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:01.738
and the male executive
chef asked me


41
00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:04.136
if I was planning
on getting married


42
00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.776
or getting pregnant
because if I was,


43
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:08.041
he couldn't hire me.

44
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.812
- Working my way up
through the ranks


45
00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:12.749
of kitchens in New York City,
it was quite challenging.


46
00:02:12.818 --> 00:02:14.883
And one of the biggest
challenges I had to overcome


47
00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:16.280
as a young sous chef

48
00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:19.888
was not because of
my cooking abilities,


49
00:02:19.957 --> 00:02:21.824
it was actually
because I was a woman.


50
00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:23.155
- One time during the judgment

51
00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:25.091
of one of those cooking
competition shows


52
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.764
on food television, I had
a male chef say to me,


53
00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:30.866
"You're a very
talented young lady."


54
00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.895
And I thought, "Why can't
you just call me chef?"


55
00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:35.101
- You're gonna meet
men in the kitchen


56
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.236
who don't want you around
because you're a woman.


57
00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:39.415
You're gonna meet
men in the kitchen


58
00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.877
who want you around
because you're a woman.


59
00:02:41.946 --> 00:02:44.176
And then you're gonna
meet other women


60
00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:47.146
who don't want you around
because you're a woman.


61
00:02:48.348 --> 00:02:49.392
And I looked at
him and I was like,


62
00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:51.953
"Well chef, where
do I go from there?"


63
00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:55.352
He's like, "Darling, you
go nowhere but up, okay?"


64
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:58.927
And I laughed and I will
never forget those words


65
00:02:58.996 --> 00:02:59.796
that he told me.

66
00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:00.865
And it's true.

67
00:03:01.768 --> 00:03:02.865
I'm Leia Gaccione.

68
00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:04.000
I've been cooking

69
00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:05.828
in some of the most
high profile restaurants


70
00:03:05.871 --> 00:03:08.134
for the last 20 years.

71
00:03:08.203 --> 00:03:10.708
I am in a small
percentage of women trying


72
00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:14.272
to make their mark in an
industry filled with dudes.


73
00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:18.408
I can think back on a lot of
female chefs that inspired me


74
00:03:18.477 --> 00:03:20.311
as I wanted to become a chef.

75
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.182
While it may be a cliche,
was there anything better


76
00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:25.855
than watching Julia
Child on television?


77
00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:27.824
And as I grew further
into my career,


78
00:03:27.893 --> 00:03:29.760
I had a meal at Dominique
Crenn's restaurant


79
00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.928
in San Francisco that
still resonates with me.


80
00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:35.359
As I started to put a
list of women together


81
00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:36.761
that I wanted to talk to,

82
00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.101
I kept coming back to one name
that truly defines a shero


83
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.774
in the kitchen,
Elizabeth Falkner.


84
00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:01.771
- My least favorite
media question I get


85
00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:03.453
is where are all
the female chefs?


86
00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:05.257
Where all the female chefs?

87
00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:06.995
I mean, there are a
lot of Joan of arcs


88
00:04:07.064 --> 00:04:08.799
in the restaurant
world all over.


89
00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:11.329
So like, Alice Waters,
Lidia Bastianich,


90
00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:14.299
Barbara Tropp, Judy
Rodgers, Cecilia Chiang,


91
00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:15.872
Anne Rosenzweig, 
Barbara Lynch,

92
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:18.006
Traci Des Jardins,
Daniela Soto-Innes.


93
00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:19.271
Where all the female chefs?

94
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.503
Where all the female chefs?

95
00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.142
And Nancy Silverton of course,

96
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.441
Joyce Goldstein, Nancy Oaks.

97
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.344
And then you had Susan Feniger

98
00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:28.819
and Mary Sue Milliken
down in Los Angeles.


99
00:04:28.888 --> 00:04:31.151
Gabrielle Hamilton and Michelle
Bernstein, Sherry Yard,


100
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.757
Jen Lewis, Anita
Lo, Lynn Crawford,


101
00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.253
Amanda Cohen, Carla Hall,

102
00:04:34.322 --> 00:04:36.156
Tonya Holland, Alex Shelley.

103
00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:37.894
There are so many female chefs.

104
00:04:37.963 --> 00:04:40.160
I don't know why people
even ask the question.


105
00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.031
People are always asking what
it's like to be a female chef.


106
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.399
And I'm like, "I don't know.

107
00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:45.512
"Let's go talk to a bunch of
female chefs and find out."


108
00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:47.096
I mean, I don't know
what else to say.


109
00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:48.403
I am a female chef

110
00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:50.215
so I don't know what it's
not like to be a female chef


111
00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:54.240
'cause I genuinely
like female cooking.


112
00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.440
It's funny because
people always think of me


113
00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.180
from my food television times
as being only a pastry chef,


114
00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:03.920
but I do make all kinds
of food, savory and sweet.


115
00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:06.384
Sometimes I like to mix it
up and screw with people.


116
00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:07.619
Today, I'm more interested

117
00:05:07.688 --> 00:05:11.422
in what ingredients tastes
like in making sweet


118
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:13.556
or savory food that tastes
like those ingredients.


119
00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.262
There's just a lot of life
lessons in cooking food.


120
00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:20.332
- Elizabeth
Falkner bridges the gap


121
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:22.466
between generations
of female chefs.


122
00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:26.404
She is an artist, an activist

123
00:05:26.473 --> 00:05:29.242
and an advocate for many things.

124
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:30.881
She was renowned for opening one

125
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.443
of the most famous bakeries

126
00:05:32.512 --> 00:05:35.116
in San Francisco, Citizen Cake,

127
00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:37.184
crushing cooking competitions

128
00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:40.825
and becoming an iconic
figure in the food world.


129
00:05:40.894 --> 00:05:45.060
Chef Elizabeth has slayed
both sweet and savory.


130
00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.161
And with 26 years behind her,

131
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.965
she is just getting started.

132
00:05:49.034 --> 00:05:50.100
- In Northern California,

133
00:05:50.168 --> 00:05:53.431
it felt like the food
scene was the scene.


134
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.038
Think about it, I came from
where Hollywood was the scene


135
00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:58.403
in LA to this place
where the chefs


136
00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:01.912
were the superstars all of
a sudden like Alice Waters


137
00:06:01.981 --> 00:06:03.309
had Chez Panisse.

138
00:06:03.378 --> 00:06:05.245
Judy Rodgers had this
restaurant called Zuni


139
00:06:05.314 --> 00:06:07.313
and then there was
Jeremiah Tower with Stars.


140
00:06:07.382 --> 00:06:10.855
And I worked at Williams-Sonoma
when I was still in college


141
00:06:10.924 --> 00:06:12.561
and I started reading
everybody's cookbooks.


142
00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:15.321
And finishing college at
San Francisco Art Institute,


143
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.623
I was making films.

144
00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:18.633
It was more like I loved
the choreography of people


145
00:06:18.657 --> 00:06:21.327
in an open kitchen like
this or behind the bar.


146
00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:23.098
And I started wanting
to just bring more


147
00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:25.529
and more food stuff
into those scenes.


148
00:06:25.598 --> 00:06:28.037
I needed to go really
be in a kitchen,


149
00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:29.919
but it was really hard for
me to get into the kitchen


150
00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:31.151
because I didn't
have any experience.


151
00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:32.441
And then I got a part-time job

152
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.880
at a little French bistro
in downtown San Francisco.


153
00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.113
I took over as the
chef pretty quickly,


154
00:06:38.182 --> 00:06:41.116
but then I staged at a fine
dining restaurant and I thought,


155
00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:43.349
"Okay, I need to go work
at that restaurant."


156
00:06:43.418 --> 00:06:45.087
And that restaurant was Masa's.

157
00:06:45.156 --> 00:06:46.422
I worked at Masa's for a year

158
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:49.256
and then I went to work for
Traci Des Jardins at Elka.


159
00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.489
And then one year
later we opened Rubicon


160
00:06:51.558 --> 00:06:52.963
where I worked for three years.

161
00:06:53.032 --> 00:06:54.042
That was a pretty big deal

162
00:06:54.066 --> 00:06:55.472
'cause Traci won
James Beard award,


163
00:06:55.496 --> 00:06:56.539
rising star chef that year.

164
00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:58.100
We were 28 years old.

165
00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.446
Everybody came into
that restaurant.


166
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.939
Julia Child came to that
restaurant, Jacques Pepin


167
00:07:02.008 --> 00:07:06.240
Claudine, tons of movie
stars, tons of wine makers.


168
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.617
It became really obvious that
I needed to open my own place.


169
00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:09.940
And I was like,

170
00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.181
"San Francisco needs a really
modern, cool pastry shop."


171
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.516
Because it just didn't exist.

172
00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:17.581
At the original Citizen Cake,
we had a wood-fired oven


173
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.122
and we did amazing
little pizzas.


174
00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:22.487
We made very eccentric
pastries and cakes.


175
00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:23.321
Made our own marshmallows,

176
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.322
made our own cream crackers.

177
00:07:24.391 --> 00:07:25.323
I know that's
really common today,


178
00:07:25.392 --> 00:07:28.031
but that didn't
even really happen.


179
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.671
And then my business
partner roasted coffee


180
00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:31.331
so that didn't even exist.

181
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.200
It was really cool.

182
00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:32.901
I learned a lot.

183
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:33.970
It was really tough.

184
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.072
I felt like our
location was too remote


185
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:39.141
so I moved it to what
became a very popular place,


186
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.276
which is Hayes Valley.

187
00:07:40.344 --> 00:07:42.090
And then that place
became a full restaurant


188
00:07:42.114 --> 00:07:43.380
and pastry shop.

189
00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:45.950
We made our own ice creams
and made all these cakes.


190
00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:47.578
I had an open pastry kitchen

191
00:07:47.647 --> 00:07:48.824
and then we had a
full restaurant too


192
00:07:48.848 --> 00:07:51.582
which was right near the
theater and always busy.


193
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:58.996
So I had Citizen Cake
for about 15 years


194
00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:01.130
and then I had a
little satellite cafe


195
00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:03.033
called Citizen
Cupcake for a minute.


196
00:08:03.102 --> 00:08:05.563
I had this other restaurant
Orson that we opened in 2008.


197
00:08:05.632 --> 00:08:07.070
That period of
time was just rough


198
00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:08.665
after the stock market crash.

199
00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:12.735
I had a life partnership
that was dissolving.


200
00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:13.970
We needed to close.

201
00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:16.409
Just real estate was
very expensive and greedy


202
00:08:16.478 --> 00:08:17.344
and lots of greedy
people around me.


203
00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:18.646
It was crazy.

204
00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:21.744
And the more popular I got,
the more Pac-Man it felt.


205
00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:24.648
People were just kind of
running after a lot of stuff.


206
00:08:24.717 --> 00:08:25.717
And then I was like,

207
00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:27.651
"I think I'm just
done in this town.


208
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.026
"I can't figure out any more.

209
00:08:29.095 --> 00:08:30.428
"I can't make this work."

210
00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:32.503
And I was like, "Okay well, I
guess maybe it's time to move


211
00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:35.329
"to New York."

212
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.268
I came to New York after
winning a piece of competition


213
00:08:40.337 --> 00:08:43.667
in Naples, Italy to open
a pizzeria in Brooklyn.


214
00:08:43.736 --> 00:08:46.241
I wanted to go back to
just like cooking in fire.


215
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.309
And then I got pulled
into consulting


216
00:08:48.378 --> 00:08:50.014
on a restaurant in
the upper West side


217
00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:52.346
and that was a really
beautiful restaurant.


218
00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:54.546
I love the cooking
competitions shows


219
00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:56.449
because I played soccer so long.

220
00:08:56.518 --> 00:08:57.784
The first shows that I did

221
00:08:57.853 --> 00:08:59.097
were the earliest Food Network
Challenges where we had


222
00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:02.323
to build some kind of
gargantuan cake sort of thing


223
00:09:02.392 --> 00:09:04.721
and then move it for some
reason across the room.


224
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.560
It feels like my culinary
and my soccer athleticness


225
00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:10.298
is meeting each
other in the middle.


226
00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:12.531
Knowing that it's a
fleeting moment of cooking


227
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.566
and not taking it so seriously,

228
00:09:14.635 --> 00:09:16.568
but this is just a fun game

229
00:09:16.637 --> 00:09:19.736
has been my favorite
part about it for sure.


230
00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:21.540
- Elizabeth asked me to meet her

231
00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:23.146
at Hong Thaimee's restaurant

232
00:09:23.215 --> 00:09:25.577
in the East village,
Thaimee Table.


233
00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:28.250
They are both cooking
for a private event


234
00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:30.780
that will raise awareness
and funds for RED.


235
00:09:30.849 --> 00:09:32.518
- I was an executive in Taiwan.

236
00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:36.489
Yeah, I ran
philanthropy department


237
00:09:36.558 --> 00:09:39.459
for big pharmaceutical
company in Bangkok.


238
00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:42.792
- Wow.
- And graduated with MBA.


239
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:47.500
Applied for a job as a hostess
at Jean-Jorges spice market


240
00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:51.207
and made my way into the
kitchen and walk through fire.


241
00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:53.704
And now I have a
couple of restaurants.


242
00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:56.839
- A lot of people would
say that we're women


243
00:09:56.908 --> 00:09:59.842
in a man's world doing this.

244
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:01.580
But then when you
really think about it,


245
00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:02.890
when you think about
all the women doing it,


246
00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:04.484
you realize there's
a lot more women


247
00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:07.553
in this business than
what everyone else makes


248
00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:08.788
it seem out to be.

249
00:10:08.857 --> 00:10:13.196
- I feel like people
underestimate us sometimes.


250
00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:15.561
They think that
women just women.


251
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.929
We not, we stronger.

252
00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:22.337
We know how to push through
things sometime more than men


253
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:25.670
because we don't have much
of an ego I would say.


254
00:10:25.739 --> 00:10:29.311
The way that we do things,
we not do it to fight.


255
00:10:30.645 --> 00:10:32.590
We not doing that, oh I
have to be better than you


256
00:10:32.614 --> 00:10:33.891
or you have to be better
than me, but we do it


257
00:10:33.915 --> 00:10:37.418
because we truly really
love to be in this industry.


258
00:10:39.258 --> 00:10:42.555
I feel like why are
we in this industry?


259
00:10:42.624 --> 00:10:44.458
So that we can
get Michelin star,


260
00:10:44.527 --> 00:10:47.527
so that we can be
number one in the world.


261
00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:49.694
I mean, I don't oppose to that,

262
00:10:49.763 --> 00:10:52.499
but that is not the
most important thing.


263
00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:55.172
We here to love and serve
people through our food.


264
00:10:55.241 --> 00:10:56.285
I don't know the rest of them,

265
00:10:56.309 --> 00:10:59.176
but that's why I'm
in this industry,


266
00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:00.639
that's why I'm working so hard,

267
00:11:00.708 --> 00:11:04.775
14 hours a day on my
feet dealing with bunions


268
00:11:04.844 --> 00:11:06.843
and all those stuff.

269
00:11:06.912 --> 00:11:11.551
We have to really look
into why are we here?


270
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.159
Going back and ask that same
question you asked yourself,


271
00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:16.094
why do you love to cook?

272
00:11:16.162 --> 00:11:17.306
Why you wanna be
in the business?


273
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.890
I feel like I wanna live
my life with purpose.


274
00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:23.398
And my purpose is to
love and serve people.


275
00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:27.864
- One of the most
important relationships I have


276
00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:31.604
outside of work is
with my brother Gary.


277
00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:33.342
This year for his birthday,

278
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:35.707
I tried to do
something super special


279
00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:37.874
because my schedule
has been very chaotic.


280
00:11:37.943 --> 00:11:38.943
Food is love to me.

281
00:11:39.011 --> 00:11:41.581
So I'm making him
one of his favorites,


282
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.321
a medium rare cheeseburger
with a runny egg.


283
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.851
What could be better than
celebrating your birthday


284
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.127
with a burger?

285
00:11:50.163 --> 00:11:51.921
It's really sweet
to give the gift


286
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.857
of food to the ones you love,

287
00:11:53.926 --> 00:11:57.267
just like Caroline Schiff
does with her desserts.


288
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.311
- It all started with
birthday cake for me.


289
00:12:09.975 --> 00:12:12.348
I mean, I would get so
excited for my birthday


290
00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:13.457
because it was about cake.

291
00:12:13.517 --> 00:12:14.944
I was like, "Well, I'm gonna get

292
00:12:15.013 --> 00:12:17.485
"to make this cake
start to finish.


293
00:12:17.554 --> 00:12:20.224
"It's gonna be exactly
what I want it to be."


294
00:12:20.293 --> 00:12:21.819
I was like in elementary school

295
00:12:21.888 --> 00:12:26.263
and I would have never
gone out to buy a cake


296
00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:28.562
or have a store-bought cake.

297
00:12:31.733 --> 00:12:33.633
I felt like it was so special.

298
00:12:33.702 --> 00:12:35.800
It was just the
most special thing


299
00:12:35.869 --> 00:12:38.770
that I got to do all year
was bake my birthday cake.


300
00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:40.508
And then as I got
a little bit older,


301
00:12:40.577 --> 00:12:42.741
it was like I wanted to
make them for other people.


302
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.842
I really started
to understand that,


303
00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:48.846
that is an incredible
gift to give to somebody.


304
00:12:54.327 --> 00:12:56.524
They have a slice of
it on their birthday


305
00:12:56.593 --> 00:13:00.264
and they're celebrating with
friends or family or whatever,


306
00:13:00.333 --> 00:13:03.696
but what I really
want them to feel


307
00:13:03.765 --> 00:13:08.767
and for them to take away is
just pure happiness.


308
00:13:22.487 --> 00:13:24.783
Strawberries and I go way back.

309
00:13:24.852 --> 00:13:29.854
I remember going to the Plaza
hotel with my mom and my aunt.


310
00:13:31.364 --> 00:13:33.001
I remember getting
strawberries and cream,


311
00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:37.895
just really sweet sugary,
macerated, strawberries.


312
00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:42.570
They were this beautiful,
hot pink red color


313
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.838
and whipped cream.

314
00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.970
And I made such a mess
and I just dove right in,


315
00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:50.413
but to me that was
the perfect food.


316
00:13:50.482 --> 00:13:53.878
That moment was the beginning
of something for me.


317
00:13:53.947 --> 00:13:58.949
It was the beginning of
this love affair with sugar


318
00:13:59.953 --> 00:14:01.523
that I've had and food.

319
00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:03.789
And I think my mother worried

320
00:14:03.858 --> 00:14:05.725
because she thought I
was the sugar monster.


321
00:14:05.794 --> 00:14:08.464
She was like, "Oh my God, my
child only wants to eat sugar."


322
00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:11.599
And there was no
doubt in my mind


323
00:14:11.668 --> 00:14:13.535
or anybody else who knew me well

324
00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:15.471
from a really
young age that food


325
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.739
and pretty specifically
dessert was the thing


326
00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:21.609
that I loved the most.

327
00:14:21.678 --> 00:14:25.074
When I was young, I would
cook mostly by myself


328
00:14:25.143 --> 00:14:28.616
mostly because I was really
bossy in the kitchen.


329
00:14:28.685 --> 00:14:32.015
My aunt, my mom's
youngest sister,


330
00:14:32.084 --> 00:14:35.755
she was a chef working in
restaurants in New York


331
00:14:35.824 --> 00:14:38.428
when I was little in the '80s.

332
00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:41.761
I just thought it was
the coolest thing.


333
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.127
She would come over with
interesting ingredients.


334
00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:48.438
I knew she was out late
working in the kitchen


335
00:14:48.507 --> 00:14:52.002
and she was downtown and I
just thought it was so cool.


336
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:55.005
And I was like, "I wanna
learn how to do that.


337
00:14:55.074 --> 00:14:59.383
"And I wanna make food
that people are gonna eat.


338
00:14:59.452 --> 00:15:00.685
"Not just for my family,

339
00:15:00.753 --> 00:15:03.046
"I wanna make food that
people want to buy and eat


340
00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:04.433
"'cause they think
it's delicious


341
00:15:04.457 --> 00:15:06.621
"and they think it's special."

342
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.557
- As she journeyed
across the world


343
00:15:08.626 --> 00:15:11.956
discovering the flavors that
would ignite a fire in her,


344
00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:13.760
Caroline's path would cross

345
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:15.597
with the uber-talented
Sohui Kim.


346
00:15:17.635 --> 00:15:19.062
- I was looking for jobs

347
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:22.769
and I have a resume
that has nothing on it.


348
00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:26.542
It has my education basically
and a little paragraph


349
00:15:26.611 --> 00:15:29.545
about what I love
about food so much.


350
00:15:29.614 --> 00:15:33.076
The only one that got back
to me was The Good Fork


351
00:15:33.145 --> 00:15:35.815
and the chef owner
here Sohui Kim.


352
00:15:35.884 --> 00:15:38.044
So she called me and she was
like, "I got your resume.


353
00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:40.952
"And you seem really passionate,

354
00:15:41.021 --> 00:15:43.889
"but it kind of looks like
you don't have any experience.


355
00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.391
"Is that true?

356
00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:49.631
And I was like, "Well, professionally,
yeah, no experience."


357
00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:54.163
I'm lucky that I found
somebody who sees the value


358
00:15:54.232 --> 00:15:58.706
in teaching people and
sees the value in somebody


359
00:15:58.775 --> 00:16:02.171
who has a ton of passion
and no experience.


360
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.208
I owe her a lot because
she saw something in me.


361
00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:08.716
- Well, it was very
well-written first of all.


362
00:16:08.785 --> 00:16:11.114
And I was very impressed
and it's not usual


363
00:16:11.183 --> 00:16:14.953
that you get very heartfelt
cover letter on a resume.


364
00:16:15.022 --> 00:16:18.726
And the first thing that I
noticed was just her sense


365
00:16:18.795 --> 00:16:22.763
of enthusiasm and her spirit.

366
00:16:22.832 --> 00:16:24.777
I don't know, it's just
hard to describe it to words


367
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:27.064
when you meet somebody
and you're like, "Wow."


368
00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:30.166
I was very, very sure from
the minute that I met her


369
00:16:30.235 --> 00:16:32.707
that she was gonna
do wonderful things.


370
00:16:32.776 --> 00:16:34.445
- I owe my career to Sohui.

371
00:16:36.582 --> 00:16:39.076
For her to be a
mentor like that,


372
00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:44.048
she was so generous with
her time and her knowledge.


373
00:16:45.184 --> 00:16:49.020
As a new cook, I
fucked up so much.


374
00:16:49.089 --> 00:16:50.153
I shouldn't say fuck.

375
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.322
- I love that, say that.

376
00:16:52.391 --> 00:16:57.160
- I fucked up so much and
she would kind of use it


377
00:16:58.296 --> 00:17:00.636
as a way to teach
you something else.


378
00:17:00.705 --> 00:17:02.770
- More than anything, I've
taught a lot of people


379
00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:04.673
in this kitchen and
more than anything,


380
00:17:04.742 --> 00:17:08.545
I value hard work, enthusiasm

381
00:17:08.614 --> 00:17:11.075
and certainly
passion for cooking.


382
00:17:11.144 --> 00:17:15.849
And she's just had the perfect
bundle of all three and more.


383
00:17:17.282 --> 00:17:19.083
When a young person comes in

384
00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:23.186
and they have so much
enthusiasm, it's infectious.


385
00:17:23.255 --> 00:17:27.058
And it makes for a very
awesome working environment.


386
00:17:27.127 --> 00:17:29.566
So right away, she
was an integral part


387
00:17:29.635 --> 00:17:30.732
of the team for sure.

388
00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:35.605
- We are back here with
our second contestant.


389
00:17:35.674 --> 00:17:36.473
What's your name?

390
00:17:36.542 --> 00:17:38.608
- Fatima Ali.
- Fatima Ali,


391
00:17:38.677 --> 00:17:39.807
where are you from?

392
00:17:39.876 --> 00:17:41.042
- Karachi, Pakistan.

393
00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:44.911
- Listen Fatima Ali,
what is unique about you?


394
00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:47.012
- Everything.

395
00:17:48.382 --> 00:17:51.984
I mean, cancer has touched
everyone in one way or the other


396
00:17:52.053 --> 00:17:53.755
whether it's yourself,
or a loved one


397
00:17:53.824 --> 00:17:55.889
or a friend, it's universal.

398
00:17:59.863 --> 00:18:02.995
The pain that it brings
is also universal.


399
00:18:03.064 --> 00:18:07.230
But I think as someone
who's gone through it,


400
00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:08.749
you have your good
and your bad days,


401
00:18:08.773 --> 00:18:09.903
but it does get better.

402
00:18:11.171 --> 00:18:13.005
There's always hope.

403
00:18:13.074 --> 00:18:15.106
There's always joy to be found

404
00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:17.108
in the little things.

405
00:18:18.651 --> 00:18:20.156
You have to find
your own distraction


406
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:20.845
to kind of get through it.

407
00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:23.246
And for me, that's food.

408
00:18:23.315 --> 00:18:26.282
For me, that's
always been cooking.


409
00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:29.725
I think what's interesting
to me is that I also realized


410
00:18:29.794 --> 00:18:32.926
how much I enjoy being a part
of bigger picture things.


411
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.634
I'm so excited to be a part
of someone's dining experience


412
00:18:37.703 --> 00:18:41.737
where they will never forget
it for the rest of their lives.


413
00:18:41.806 --> 00:18:44.608
They'll talk about it for years.

414
00:18:44.677 --> 00:18:48.645
And in my own little way
may have had a hand in that


415
00:18:48.714 --> 00:18:50.845
and that's something
that's very special to me.


416
00:18:50.914 --> 00:18:53.144
And that's the reason
I became a chef.


417
00:18:53.213 --> 00:18:56.015
- I have always been
an avid watcher of "Top Chef".


418
00:18:56.084 --> 00:18:58.886
Cooking shows are what started
my love affair with food.


419
00:18:58.955 --> 00:19:01.284
I was really rooting
for chef Fatima Ali


420
00:19:01.353 --> 00:19:03.924
like so many other
Americans that were glued


421
00:19:03.993 --> 00:19:06.058
to the screen during season 15.

422
00:19:06.127 --> 00:19:07.664
As I convinced
myself to reach out


423
00:19:07.733 --> 00:19:09.292
to my new inspiration Fatima,

424
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:12.295
I tried not to let my fan
girl get the best of me.


425
00:19:12.364 --> 00:19:13.802
After our first chat,

426
00:19:13.871 --> 00:19:17.641
I knew this was a
very special person,


427
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.940
not because of how
her story ends up,


428
00:19:20.009 --> 00:19:21.645
but because of how it began

429
00:19:21.714 --> 00:19:24.043
and how she literally
became a top chef.


430
00:19:24.112 --> 00:19:25.913
- I was very, very young.

431
00:19:25.982 --> 00:19:27.181
According to my mom,

432
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.181
I think I started cooking
at about four or five.


433
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.282
I remember really
being in the kitchen.


434
00:19:32.351 --> 00:19:34.119
I was probably
about eight or nine.


435
00:19:34.188 --> 00:19:36.088
I was too young to cook anything

436
00:19:36.157 --> 00:19:37.797
on the stove according
to my grandmother


437
00:19:37.862 --> 00:19:40.323
so she would boil
the water for me


438
00:19:40.392 --> 00:19:42.028
and I would make soup.

439
00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:44.833
I remember putting
cabbage in it and carrots


440
00:19:44.902 --> 00:19:47.198
and seasoning it and just
really just warm water


441
00:19:47.267 --> 00:19:49.937
and barely wilted
vegetables really,


442
00:19:50.006 --> 00:19:51.873
but I was so proud
of my creation.


443
00:19:51.942 --> 00:19:53.702
The older I got, the
more I started cooking,


444
00:19:53.746 --> 00:19:56.240
the more I began to
explore different kinds


445
00:19:56.309 --> 00:20:00.816
of cuisines with my dad
who was actually a lawyer.


446
00:20:00.885 --> 00:20:02.017
He traveled a lot

447
00:20:02.086 --> 00:20:03.197
and anytime he would go
to different countries,


448
00:20:03.221 --> 00:20:05.381
he would bring back
something interesting.


449
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.350
My family's basically
been my guinea pig.


450
00:20:07.419 --> 00:20:08.551
I've made a lot

451
00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.219
of really horrible
things over the years too


452
00:20:09.288 --> 00:20:10.958
when I was younger.

453
00:20:11.027 --> 00:20:12.027
If it wasn't for them,

454
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:13.335
I wouldn't be doing
what I was doing.


455
00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:15.391
- As a little girl growing up,

456
00:20:16.461 --> 00:20:18.999
she was very sporty,
very friendly.


457
00:20:19.068 --> 00:20:23.003
When other kids her age were
watching Cartoon Network,


458
00:20:23.072 --> 00:20:24.774
she was watching BBC Food.

459
00:20:24.843 --> 00:20:27.810
Back in the day, she
loved "Yan Can Cook".


460
00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:28.976
- If Yan Can Cook!

461
00:20:29.045 --> 00:20:30.945
- So can we!

462
00:20:31.014 --> 00:20:33.145
- When we were in Austin, Texas,

463
00:20:33.214 --> 00:20:36.280
I still remember her kindergarten
teacher, lovely lady,


464
00:20:36.349 --> 00:20:37.548
she used to send

465
00:20:37.617 --> 00:20:41.186
these little pictogram
recipes home every weekend.


466
00:20:41.255 --> 00:20:44.156
So every Friday, she'd
come rushing home


467
00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:45.729
with that little recipe.

468
00:20:45.798 --> 00:20:47.291
We'd put that recipe together.

469
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.734
Her love for food
just naturally started


470
00:20:50.803 --> 00:20:53.396
when she was really,
really very young.


471
00:20:53.465 --> 00:20:55.871
And I think as she grew older,

472
00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.203
she found a lot
of comfort in it.


473
00:21:01.077 --> 00:21:03.978
- My mom's always
encouraged me in the kitchen


474
00:21:04.047 --> 00:21:05.980
and she's really encouraged
and pushed me to try


475
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:08.345
and be the best that
I can possibly be.


476
00:21:08.414 --> 00:21:13.086
When I was about

477
00:21:13.155 --> 00:21:15.484
and told her I wanted to
become a professional chef.


478
00:21:15.553 --> 00:21:18.454
And she told me
that I could do that


479
00:21:18.523 --> 00:21:20.043
as long as I got a
bachelor's degree.


480
00:21:20.096 --> 00:21:22.458
So I hopped on my computer

481
00:21:22.527 --> 00:21:26.495
and I googled America
culinary bachelors.


482
00:21:26.564 --> 00:21:27.608
The first school that popped up

483
00:21:27.632 --> 00:21:30.807
was the Culinary
Institute of America.


484
00:21:30.876 --> 00:21:34.041
I'd never been to that
part of the world before.


485
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.308
And it was just a
really exciting,


486
00:21:37.377 --> 00:21:40.014
but also nerve wracking
journey, moving from Pakistan,


487
00:21:40.083 --> 00:21:42.984
coming here for college
and then immersing myself


488
00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:46.922
in a field that I had
so much passion for,


489
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:50.090
but no actual hands-on
experience of yet.


490
00:21:51.391 --> 00:21:53.126
I remember the first
time buttoning up


491
00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:54.556
our pristine chef jackets

492
00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:56.734
and assessing
ourselves for an hour.


493
00:21:58.398 --> 00:22:01.970
We will remember standing in
unknown kitchens, knife in hand


494
00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:03.939
and ready to conquer all.

495
00:22:04.008 --> 00:22:05.414
And we will remember
the cuts and burns


496
00:22:05.438 --> 00:22:07.569
in our hands as evidence.

497
00:22:07.638 --> 00:22:10.539
Deep down inside most of
us lies this incessant urge


498
00:22:10.608 --> 00:22:13.817
for acknowledgement,
for approval.


499
00:22:13.886 --> 00:22:15.819
For if we did not
have that need,


500
00:22:15.888 --> 00:22:17.821
we would not have become chefs.

501
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.156
A plate of food

502
00:22:19.225 --> 00:22:22.386
is merely ordinary until
someone deems it magnificent.


503
00:22:23.489 --> 00:22:26.159
We are all morbidly
afraid of being ordinary


504
00:22:26.228 --> 00:22:30.229
for there seems no other
thing so horrific as that.


505
00:22:30.298 --> 00:22:33.562
But today, it has
been acknowledged,


506
00:22:33.631 --> 00:22:37.566
you have been acknowledged,
we have been acknowledged


507
00:22:37.635 --> 00:22:40.503
as being absolutely
extraordinary.


508
00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:41.572
- And I told her, I said,

509
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.572
"If this is what
you're gonna pursue,


510
00:22:43.641 --> 00:22:45.343
"this is what you're gonna do.

511
00:22:45.412 --> 00:22:48.379
"You will promise me that
you will be the best."


512
00:22:48.448 --> 00:22:49.985
- See, I wasn't making it up.

513
00:22:51.517 --> 00:22:53.516
- Not because of any pressure,

514
00:22:53.585 --> 00:22:57.586
but because I feel you've
got to own it, right?


515
00:22:57.655 --> 00:23:00.391
It's like if this
is your commitment,


516
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.162
then that commitment
needs to show.


517
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:03.933
- With her mother's blessing

518
00:23:04.002 --> 00:23:05.335
and a dream in her heart,

519
00:23:05.403 --> 00:23:09.598
Fatima met her uncles Sibte
in the city that never sleeps.


520
00:23:09.667 --> 00:23:11.974
- New York is tough,
but I know her


521
00:23:12.043 --> 00:23:16.572
and she can dig up a whole
mountain with a spoon


522
00:23:16.641 --> 00:23:18.112
if she needs to.

523
00:23:18.181 --> 00:23:20.147
We had a long conversation,

524
00:23:20.216 --> 00:23:21.951
her ambitions, what
she wants to do.


525
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.547
She is focused and it's
very rare to find somebody


526
00:23:24.616 --> 00:23:25.616
with that much focus.

527
00:23:25.684 --> 00:23:29.123
- I found myself
working at Cafe Centro,


528
00:23:29.192 --> 00:23:31.389
which is a part of the Patina
group in New York City.


529
00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:34.458
I actually found myself
working for Maneet Chauhan.


530
00:23:34.527 --> 00:23:39.298
Seeing a woman of color
doing such interesting


531
00:23:39.367 --> 00:23:42.070
and fantastic things in the
industry was really inspiring.


532
00:23:42.139 --> 00:23:43.539
- One of the most
endearing things


533
00:23:43.569 --> 00:23:47.207
to me about Fatima was
her, there is nothing


534
00:23:47.276 --> 00:23:49.209
that's going to phase
me out attitude.


535
00:23:49.278 --> 00:23:50.552
- I think it was
really important


536
00:23:50.576 --> 00:23:53.576
for me to be
able to see a woman

537
00:23:53.645 --> 00:23:56.447
who was running a restaurant
and who's successful at it.


538
00:23:56.516 --> 00:24:00.121
- I think as a
female chef myself,


539
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.190
it is my responsibility
to help pave way


540
00:24:03.259 --> 00:24:07.931
for more young female
chefs to make a mark


541
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.592
and an impact in the industry.

542
00:24:09.661 --> 00:24:12.034
She got an opportunity.

543
00:24:12.103 --> 00:24:14.201
She did not squander
that opportunity.


544
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.137
She was a shining
star and I think


545
00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:19.206
that was the most incredible
part about Fatima.


546
00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:23.144
- I think when you talk
about Nona or grandma cooking


547
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:30.118
- in Italy, right?
- - Yeah.


548
00:24:30.187 --> 00:24:32.219
- They usually
run the restaurant


549
00:24:32.288 --> 00:24:34.002
and the kids just happened
to work there too,


550
00:24:34.026 --> 00:24:36.619
but the mom is the boss.

551
00:24:43.035 --> 00:24:45.067
- I mean, being
immigrant family,


552
00:24:45.136 --> 00:24:47.069
obviously it's either
one of two things.


553
00:24:47.138 --> 00:24:48.643
You're either gonna be
a lawyer or a doctor.


554
00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:51.634
And there's no other option,
no other career path.


555
00:24:51.703 --> 00:24:52.780
You're either a
lawyer or a doctor.


556
00:24:52.804 --> 00:24:56.111
And my parents drilled
that into my head


557
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.014
since I was really little.

558
00:25:00.613 --> 00:25:02.558
They were like, "Oh, your
sister's gonna be a doctor


559
00:25:02.582 --> 00:25:04.185
"so you're gonna be a lawyer."

560
00:25:05.354 --> 00:25:07.287
And then she chose
a different path.


561
00:25:07.356 --> 00:25:08.422
So they were like,

562
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.501
"Okay, so you're gonna
be the doctor now."


563
00:25:09.525 --> 00:25:13.656
It's funny, they
were very strict,


564
00:25:13.725 --> 00:25:17.297
but my mom, she's a tough woman.

565
00:25:17.366 --> 00:25:18.969
She taught me how to be tough.

566
00:25:23.405 --> 00:25:25.272
As soon as I put
on those whites,


567
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:28.770
I kind of just had
this weird, emotional,


568
00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:32.015
that weird feeling in
your throat like a lump.


569
00:25:32.084 --> 00:25:33.676
And it was really
emotional for me


570
00:25:33.745 --> 00:25:37.185
and I think that I
really wanted to try.


571
00:25:37.254 --> 00:25:39.319
I think I really fell
in love with the kitchen


572
00:25:39.388 --> 00:25:41.189
and the atmosphere.

573
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.655
I think the biggest thing
is commitment, right?


574
00:25:45.724 --> 00:25:49.560
If you're not ready
to be committed 150%,


575
00:25:50.861 --> 00:25:54.268
then maybe you wanna wait
because once you go restaurant,


576
00:25:54.337 --> 00:25:55.436
you can't go un-restaurant.

577
00:25:55.505 --> 00:25:59.042
It's like, you got to
give it your all really.


578
00:26:10.122 --> 00:26:12.187
I grew up in an
immigrant family.


579
00:26:12.256 --> 00:26:14.288
My parents are from South Korea.

580
00:26:14.357 --> 00:26:17.456
They came over here, had my
sister and me and my brother.


581
00:26:17.525 --> 00:26:22.527
And they needed a work
obviously to support the family.


582
00:26:23.663 --> 00:26:24.673
We were raised by
our grandparents.


583
00:26:24.697 --> 00:26:27.202
My grandma is this
phenomenal cook.


584
00:26:27.271 --> 00:26:29.435
She grew all of her own produce.

585
00:26:29.504 --> 00:26:32.768
So we had this huge
garden in our backyard.


586
00:26:32.837 --> 00:26:37.245
And I remember growing up,
that was my favorite thing,


587
00:26:37.314 --> 00:26:39.181
hanging around with grandma,

588
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.679
watering the garden,
picking all the produce


589
00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:44.417
and then using that produce

590
00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:46.386
to cook whatever she's
gonna cook at home.


591
00:26:46.455 --> 00:26:49.455
She made everything from
scratch like gochujang


592
00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:51.193
even soy sauce.

593
00:26:51.262 --> 00:26:53.657
Going to school, after
that I would run home


594
00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:57.496
to eat kalbi and kimchi with
my grandma and cook with her.


595
00:26:57.565 --> 00:27:00.862
And that was one of
my favorite memories


596
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:02.732
of my childhood.

597
00:27:02.801 --> 00:27:04.569
My sister, we're
the Choi sisters.


598
00:27:06.805 --> 00:27:07.904
- The Choi sisters.
- Yeah.


599
00:27:07.973 --> 00:27:09.388
- It's like a nickname
that we had for a while.


600
00:27:09.412 --> 00:27:10.443
- For a long, yeah.

601
00:27:10.512 --> 00:27:11.774
- Are you super close?

602
00:27:11.843 --> 00:27:13.776
- Super, super
close, definitely.


603
00:27:13.845 --> 00:27:15.196
- People think
it's a little weird


604
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.120
'cause we're too close.

605
00:27:17.189 --> 00:27:18.321
- In my life,

606
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.454
my grandfather was kind
of like the stand-in dad


607
00:27:21.523 --> 00:27:25.326
so I understand your bond with
your grandmother especially.


608
00:27:25.395 --> 00:27:29.462
- She really taught me
sort of how to love food.


609
00:27:29.531 --> 00:27:31.860
It's not like she
taught me step-by-step


610
00:27:31.929 --> 00:27:33.400
how to make certain dishes.

611
00:27:33.469 --> 00:27:34.501
You know what I mean?

612
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.239
It was more so her
philosophy of cooking


613
00:27:37.308 --> 00:27:40.209
and why you should
cook for people


614
00:27:40.278 --> 00:27:44.411
and how to show people
that you care through food.


615
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.480
- Ready?

616
00:28:11.738 --> 00:28:14.375
- Our family motto
is love is patient


617
00:28:14.444 --> 00:28:16.509
and she's the one
who established that


618
00:28:16.578 --> 00:28:18.313
and it's from the Bible.

619
00:28:18.382 --> 00:28:21.514
It's very inspiring and
that's what we live by.


620
00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:26.189
- But there was one
period of my childhood


621
00:28:26.258 --> 00:28:29.720
where my parents literally
plucked me out of school,


622
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:33.592
put me in a foreign
school in South Korea.


623
00:28:33.661 --> 00:28:34.661
It was really difficult,

624
00:28:34.695 --> 00:28:36.039
but it was such
an impactful time.


625
00:28:36.063 --> 00:28:40.698
Going back to sort of the roots
being around this culture,


626
00:28:40.767 --> 00:28:42.931
it made me appreciate
it a lot more.


627
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.266
I remember the food.

628
00:28:44.335 --> 00:28:47.969
I remember the people, the
kids that I hung out with


629
00:28:48.038 --> 00:28:50.873
and it was very
inspirational for me.


630
00:28:50.942 --> 00:28:52.908
I went to school up
until sixth grade


631
00:28:52.977 --> 00:28:54.121
and then my parents
brought me back.


632
00:28:54.145 --> 00:28:56.978
I started working in a
restaurant when I was 14


633
00:28:57.047 --> 00:29:00.223
at a Korean Japanese
restaurant, really small.


634
00:29:00.292 --> 00:29:03.754
So I would run to work
and work till midnight


635
00:29:03.823 --> 00:29:05.690
and then go back to
school the next day.


636
00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:08.396
When I went to college and
graduated from college,


637
00:29:08.465 --> 00:29:10.497
I've always had restaurant jobs.

638
00:29:10.566 --> 00:29:13.368
I was falling in love
with it without knowing


639
00:29:13.437 --> 00:29:15.238
that I was falling
in love with it.


640
00:29:16.374 --> 00:29:17.966
- Esther would
find herself working


641
00:29:18.035 --> 00:29:20.903
amongst the biggest
names in food television.


642
00:29:20.972 --> 00:29:25.479
- Honestly, Food Network was
such a special time for me.


643
00:29:25.548 --> 00:29:27.910
Position that I chose
was more like working


644
00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:31.914
with all of the top chefs,
working on "Iron chef"


645
00:29:31.983 --> 00:29:34.521
and being probably one of
the most powerful people


646
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.556
on the team because literally,

647
00:29:36.625 --> 00:29:38.855
I was the one buying
every single ingredient


648
00:29:38.924 --> 00:29:41.726
for all the chefs,
the whole kitchen,


649
00:29:41.795 --> 00:29:43.464
sourcing it from
all over the world,


650
00:29:43.533 --> 00:29:45.664
dealing with vendors, purveyors.

651
00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:47.699
It's like, if I didn't
have that position


652
00:29:47.768 --> 00:29:51.472
at the Food Network, I
probably wouldn't know


653
00:29:51.541 --> 00:29:53.705
how to do half the
shit that I do now.


654
00:29:53.774 --> 00:29:56.840
Growing up watching these
chefs on television,


655
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:58.677
seeing what they
do, it's amazing.


656
00:29:58.746 --> 00:30:00.547
So it was always kind of there

657
00:30:00.616 --> 00:30:02.912
that I knew I wanted
to have my own place.


658
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:04.314
And we came up with this concept

659
00:30:04.382 --> 00:30:09.457
of Korean ramen because ramen
at the time was on the rise.


660
00:30:10.758 --> 00:30:12.472
I remember the day because
it was New Year's Day,


661
00:30:12.496 --> 00:30:15.562
January 1st of

662
00:30:15.631 --> 00:30:17.729
and told me that they're
gonna give me this space.


663
00:30:17.798 --> 00:30:20.435
And then that's
when the real scare,


664
00:30:20.504 --> 00:30:21.997
real fear started.

665
00:30:22.066 --> 00:30:24.835
Three weeks before I
was supposed to open,


666
00:30:24.904 --> 00:30:27.739
the one person that
I hired quit on me


667
00:30:27.808 --> 00:30:29.609
and then I had
literally no staff


668
00:30:29.678 --> 00:30:31.644
and I was supposed to
open in three weeks.


669
00:30:31.713 --> 00:30:35.714
My sister actually
quit her job to join me


670
00:30:35.783 --> 00:30:36.783
and help me open this.

671
00:30:36.817 --> 00:30:38.816
She kind of like
really came through


672
00:30:38.885 --> 00:30:41.720
and somehow we got
through it and we did it.


673
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:43.920
- One of Esther's
culinary acquaintances


674
00:30:43.989 --> 00:30:47.055
is the incredible Chef Bao Bao.

675
00:30:47.124 --> 00:30:49.893
She joined us between
lunch and dinner service.


676
00:30:49.962 --> 00:30:52.698
- I feel like it is a
little bit intimidating


677
00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:54.700
in the beginning of course,

678
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:59.738
but it's just about knowing
who you are and just embracing


679
00:31:00.841 --> 00:31:02.477
that you are the
female in the kitchen


680
00:31:02.546 --> 00:31:04.347
and it's fine, it's okay.

681
00:31:04.416 --> 00:31:06.074
There's different
skills that you can use


682
00:31:06.143 --> 00:31:08.351
as a female as opposed to male.

683
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.355
And honestly, I really don't
even like to discriminate like,


684
00:31:12.424 --> 00:31:13.884
"Oh, that person's a female."

685
00:31:13.953 --> 00:31:17.393
And my kitchen, I would
say it's very 50/50.


686
00:31:17.462 --> 00:31:20.088
Actually, more women work
in my kitchen than men.


687
00:31:20.157 --> 00:31:21.157
- Mine too.

688
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:22.268
- It just happens
to be like that.


689
00:31:22.292 --> 00:31:23.436
- Do you think that
because you're women,


690
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.033
you attract more women
to work in your kitchen?


691
00:31:26.102 --> 00:31:30.505
- Yes, and also a background
story also attach those people


692
00:31:30.574 --> 00:31:33.376
to come in because they
also believe in themselves


693
00:31:33.445 --> 00:31:34.740
that why can't I?

694
00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:37.039
If male can do it, why can't I?

695
00:31:37.108 --> 00:31:39.041
I just wanna show the skill

696
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:42.715
and trying to prove
that they can do it too.


697
00:31:42.784 --> 00:31:47.522
So, I mean in Asia,
most of family,


698
00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:50.558
the female will be the
best cook in the family.


699
00:31:51.859 --> 00:31:55.662
We don't see that many
males cook in our hometown,


700
00:31:55.731 --> 00:31:57.466
I mean in our country.

701
00:31:57.535 --> 00:32:00.535
But just when I moved
here to this country,


702
00:32:00.604 --> 00:32:01.899
I see so many male chefs

703
00:32:01.968 --> 00:32:03.472
and I was like, "Wow!"

704
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:04.585
- Where's all the females?

705
00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:06.068
- Yeah, where's all the females?

706
00:32:07.479 --> 00:32:08.778
- As I continued hearing

707
00:32:08.847 --> 00:32:11.612
how each of these chefs found
their passion for cooking,


708
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:13.121
I had found out
about a rising star


709
00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:15.649
in Harlem, Juliet Masters.

710
00:32:15.718 --> 00:32:19.048
So I drove to The Edge to
hear her incredible journey.


711
00:32:19.117 --> 00:32:22.689
♪ You look so lovable ♪

712
00:32:22.758 --> 00:32:24.889
- This business
would not exist without family


713
00:32:24.958 --> 00:32:27.661
and it's not just
our immediate family,


714
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.730
but it's the family that
we have in the kitchen,


715
00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:32.831
all the people who work with us.

716
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.032
We have people who have been
with us from the beginning.


717
00:32:41.238 --> 00:32:43.710
And then we have the
family of the neighborhood.


718
00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:45.976
We have a beautiful,
lovely neighborhood.


719
00:32:46.045 --> 00:32:47.978
And we have a lot of
people who walk by


720
00:32:48.047 --> 00:32:50.079
and stick their
head in and say hi


721
00:32:50.148 --> 00:32:52.180
and know us when we come out.

722
00:32:52.249 --> 00:32:53.482
They look out for us.

723
00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.756
So the family includes
obviously our immediate family,


724
00:32:56.825 --> 00:32:58.725
but it spreads out
to our community.


725
00:32:58.794 --> 00:33:01.728
The people who have supported
us who live down the block.


726
00:33:01.797 --> 00:33:05.930
Family is the backbone
of this business.


727
00:33:10.036 --> 00:33:14.939
It trickles from Justine and
Juliet, to Justine and Juliet,


728
00:33:15.008 --> 00:33:18.877
and mommy and daddy and son,
and then to kitchen staff,


729
00:33:18.946 --> 00:33:21.682
and to floor staff and
out into our community.


730
00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:28.183
We are Harlem.

731
00:33:29.088 --> 00:33:30.625
We've lived here for 20 years.

732
00:33:30.694 --> 00:33:31.890
We're from New York.

733
00:33:33.092 --> 00:33:34.662
So for us to open up this space,

734
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:36.862
it's paying homage to the spirit

735
00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:40.162
of those who've come before
us, but also to the fact


736
00:33:40.231 --> 00:33:42.901
that this the community
demanded this space


737
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.034
to be born as well.

738
00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.974
- The Edge sits on
Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem.


739
00:33:50.043 --> 00:33:51.745
On Wednesdays, the
restaurant is filled


740
00:33:51.814 --> 00:33:55.045
with subtle musical notes
from jazz musicians,


741
00:33:55.114 --> 00:33:58.818
beautiful words of poets and
others that are a reminder


742
00:33:58.887 --> 00:34:01.755
of the heritage that
fills this space.


743
00:34:01.824 --> 00:34:03.658
On the roof of this building,

744
00:34:03.727 --> 00:34:07.695
notables such as Langston
Hughes, Ethel Ray Nance,


745
00:34:07.764 --> 00:34:10.797
and Regina M. Anderson
shared philosophies


746
00:34:10.866 --> 00:34:14.933
and literary art that lends
to the history of Harlem.


747
00:34:15.002 --> 00:34:19.102
And now, it's home to two
sisters whose close family ties


748
00:34:19.171 --> 00:34:21.203
were the right recipe
to have what it takes


749
00:34:21.272 --> 00:34:23.205
to open this restaurant.

750
00:34:23.274 --> 00:34:25.548
Justine runs the
front of the house


751
00:34:25.617 --> 00:34:27.880
and Juliet is the
heart of the kitchen.


752
00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:32.115
- I always told Justine as
her older sister I said,


753
00:34:32.184 --> 00:34:34.557
"One day we're gonna
do something together."


754
00:34:36.056 --> 00:34:38.660
Life before the internet
and phones and all that,


755
00:34:38.729 --> 00:34:40.024
there was a lot of pretend games

756
00:34:40.093 --> 00:34:41.359
so we pretended a lot.

757
00:34:41.428 --> 00:34:44.930
One of the things we pretended
was having restaurants


758
00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:46.031
and serving people.

759
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.901
We were the hostesses,
would make menus


760
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.970
and prepare grapefruit
and serve to my parents


761
00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:53.272
with orange juice.

762
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.271
We grew up as best friends.
- Using our imagination.


763
00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.141
- And using our imagination.

764
00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:02.618
We have remained best
friends throughout life.


765
00:35:02.687 --> 00:35:04.785
We're not identical,
we're not twins


766
00:35:04.854 --> 00:35:08.250
although everyone asks us
every day, "Are we twins?"


767
00:35:08.319 --> 00:35:10.318
- Juliet Masters
discovered the flavors


768
00:35:10.387 --> 00:35:13.321
of her childhood living
in three distinct regions


769
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:14.456
of the world.

770
00:35:14.524 --> 00:35:17.798
- New York wasn't that
easy where we lived


771
00:35:17.867 --> 00:35:18.966
and when we lived there.

772
00:35:19.035 --> 00:35:21.230
So they took one look
at their surroundings,


773
00:35:21.299 --> 00:35:22.565
they were like,

774
00:35:22.634 --> 00:35:25.069
"let's take our daughters
to Jamaica and let's live


775
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.775
"in a tropical Island."

776
00:35:27.844 --> 00:35:31.273
And one of the jobs in Jamaica
is as a chef or a helper.


777
00:35:31.342 --> 00:35:33.649
My parents didn't
necessarily need a helper,


778
00:35:33.718 --> 00:35:36.014
but we had Becky as
part of our family.


779
00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:37.182
She cooked for our family.

780
00:35:37.251 --> 00:35:39.820
And I was to go into
the kitchen with Becky


781
00:35:39.889 --> 00:35:42.889
and watch how everything
was from scratch.


782
00:35:42.958 --> 00:35:45.760
Things that you make in
Jamaica like Johnny cakes


783
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:47.630
and fried dumplings
and festivals.


784
00:35:47.699 --> 00:35:49.204
She might've been one
of the first people


785
00:35:49.228 --> 00:35:53.834
to start igniting the
fires, that culinary desire


786
00:35:53.903 --> 00:35:55.102
that I was going down.

787
00:35:55.171 --> 00:35:58.905
In England, both of my
aunts were entrepreneurs.


788
00:35:58.974 --> 00:36:02.238
I have examples, living
examples of people doing this.


789
00:36:03.715 --> 00:36:05.978
I had my son, I
was in my twenties.


790
00:36:06.047 --> 00:36:10.653
I was working full-time for
music for Def Jam Records


791
00:36:10.722 --> 00:36:11.722
as an assistant.

792
00:36:11.789 --> 00:36:12.921
And then I had my son.

793
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.134
They were like, "Okay,
see you in six weeks."


794
00:36:14.158 --> 00:36:18.826
I was like, "Oh no, no
way, no, not six weeks.


795
00:36:18.895 --> 00:36:22.027
"I will take care of my child
rather than pay somebody else


796
00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:23.226
"and I'll figure it out."

797
00:36:23.295 --> 00:36:24.394
I got into catering

798
00:36:24.463 --> 00:36:27.197
because catering you got
paid 20 bucks an hour


799
00:36:27.266 --> 00:36:28.276
and it was five hours shifts

800
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.344
so it was something
that I could do.


801
00:36:29.368 --> 00:36:32.873
Maybe I can go behind
and start working


802
00:36:32.942 --> 00:36:33.942
in the back of the house.

803
00:36:33.976 --> 00:36:35.909
It was right then
when I realized


804
00:36:35.978 --> 00:36:38.813
that I really liked the
preparation of food.


805
00:36:38.882 --> 00:36:41.112
Researched the Natural
Gourmet Institute.


806
00:36:41.181 --> 00:36:44.918
It began there and just
grew very organically.


807
00:36:50.762 --> 00:36:55.258
- It wasn't a surprise to
me that she chose this path.


808
00:36:55.327 --> 00:36:59.295
What is more surprising is how
successful it quickly became.


809
00:36:59.364 --> 00:37:01.429
- I think Juliet
was able to do it


810
00:37:01.498 --> 00:37:04.102
because Justine was able to say,

811
00:37:04.171 --> 00:37:05.171
"If you don't do it now,

812
00:37:05.239 --> 00:37:07.710
"it may never be
there for you again."


813
00:37:07.779 --> 00:37:11.043
- Either you take this or
you walk by this every day


814
00:37:11.112 --> 00:37:12.473
and pissed off that you didn't

815
00:37:12.542 --> 00:37:15.014
because you're gonna
be living upstairs.


816
00:37:19.054 --> 00:37:22.219
And I was like, "Oh shit, I
better put a menu together."


817
00:37:23.355 --> 00:37:24.120
No, I'm serious.

818
00:37:24.189 --> 00:37:25.522
Basically, we broke it down.

819
00:37:25.591 --> 00:37:29.061
We can do Jamaica, we can do
England and we can do New York.


820
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.170
And let's pick a few things
from those three places


821
00:37:31.198 --> 00:37:32.364
and that'll be the menu.

822
00:37:32.433 --> 00:37:34.396
- This is the type of
space that when you see it,


823
00:37:34.465 --> 00:37:36.739
it demanded to be born.

824
00:37:36.808 --> 00:37:39.940
It is very in line
with our personalities.


825
00:37:40.009 --> 00:37:41.436
It's off the beaten path.

826
00:37:41.505 --> 00:37:44.373
It's intimate, it's
cozy, it's warm


827
00:37:44.442 --> 00:37:47.816
'cause Juliet and I definitely
didn't have a business plan


828
00:37:47.885 --> 00:37:49.225
and definitely didn't
have any money.


829
00:37:49.249 --> 00:37:51.754
There was no option
to fail here.


830
00:37:51.823 --> 00:37:53.022
- As a woman,

831
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:56.759
you have maybe a few extra
layers to push through


832
00:37:56.828 --> 00:37:58.156
to get to where you're going.

833
00:37:58.225 --> 00:38:01.390
You can't be afraid to
do the heavy lifting


834
00:38:01.459 --> 00:38:02.523
and the dirty work.

835
00:38:02.592 --> 00:38:06.296
You can't stay in the box.

836
00:38:06.365 --> 00:38:10.102
You have to be able to
do whatever it takes.


837
00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:11.482
- You have to
pay attention as a woman.


838
00:38:11.506 --> 00:38:12.850
- You have to pay
attention to the details.


839
00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:15.437
- You have to know everybody's
position in your business


840
00:38:15.506 --> 00:38:18.781
so that if they're not
there, you can do their job


841
00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.509
or you know that if they're
doing their job well or not.


842
00:38:21.578 --> 00:38:25.084
It's having to maybe
even be more sharper


843
00:38:25.153 --> 00:38:26.283
because you're a woman.

844
00:38:28.926 --> 00:38:31.860
- We have a kitchen
that is all male.


845
00:38:33.326 --> 00:38:35.963
Sometimes as a woman,
when you are the boss,


846
00:38:36.032 --> 00:38:39.428
you have to work harder
to earn your respect.


847
00:38:40.531 --> 00:38:43.234
- To assert yourself
as the boss.


848
00:38:43.303 --> 00:38:47.172
To just do what I say please.

849
00:38:47.241 --> 00:38:48.383
- People feel they
have more leeway


850
00:38:48.407 --> 00:38:49.977
with you when you're a woman.

851
00:38:51.347 --> 00:38:54.080
There are more excuses or
there's more of a conversation


852
00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:55.345
than there needs to be.

853
00:38:55.414 --> 00:38:59.019
And I feel as women,
we're required


854
00:38:59.088 --> 00:39:04.024
to engage our masculine energy
in order to be the boss.


855
00:39:05.292 --> 00:39:08.831
So it's important as
a woman to do that,


856
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.492
but then to also
find the balance


857
00:39:11.529 --> 00:39:12.573
to do things that are feminine

858
00:39:12.597 --> 00:39:15.398
so that you're balancing
those energies.


859
00:39:15.467 --> 00:39:16.533
- As a chef,

860
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:18.012
I'm aware that
opportunities come knocking


861
00:39:18.036 --> 00:39:22.108
and you have to have a certain
toughness to answer the call.


862
00:39:22.177 --> 00:39:24.242
As Hillary Sterling
got opportunities,


863
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:26.112
not only did she answer them,

864
00:39:26.181 --> 00:39:28.246
but she also rewrote
the conversation


865
00:39:28.315 --> 00:39:30.215
on what it is to be the best.

866
00:39:34.288 --> 00:39:37.222
- Food is about passion and
it's supposed to be fun.


867
00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:39.587
And this is what we do for
living and we chose it.


868
00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:40.755
It didn't choose us.

869
00:39:40.824 --> 00:39:43.261
We actually went out
and sought this career


870
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.099
in this industry and
just don't give up.


871
00:39:46.168 --> 00:39:48.134
All right, let's
go, I need 17 cacio.


872
00:39:49.468 --> 00:39:53.876
One half, one no cheese, one
no butter, one no pepper.


873
00:39:54.979 --> 00:39:59.046
We do the same thing
every day give or take.


874
00:39:59.115 --> 00:40:01.543
A vegetable, a
protein, a person.


875
00:40:01.612 --> 00:40:05.052
We need four tomato
pizzas, one pepperoni,


876
00:40:05.121 --> 00:40:07.318
and one rapini please.

877
00:40:07.387 --> 00:40:09.056
I got two more carrots guys.

878
00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:10.366
If you want it, you can have it.

879
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.224
You just cannot give up.

880
00:40:12.293 --> 00:40:13.459
And it doesn't matter

881
00:40:13.528 --> 00:40:15.328
if you cry in the walk-in
'cause everyone has


882
00:40:15.362 --> 00:40:16.591
and everyone does it.

883
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.934
Guys and girls don't be fooled,

884
00:40:19.003 --> 00:40:19.802
just don't give up.

885
00:40:19.871 --> 00:40:22.036
Honestly, I stand by that 100%

886
00:40:22.105 --> 00:40:25.171
and allow you to be nurtured.

887
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.240
Ask questions and
don't just assume.


888
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:29.978
Even if I'm crazy some days,

889
00:40:31.983 --> 00:40:34.114
if you ask me a question,
I'm always gonna stop


890
00:40:34.183 --> 00:40:37.249
and give you some long
answer or short answer


891
00:40:37.318 --> 00:40:40.318
or I'm gonna help
you through your day.


892
00:40:40.387 --> 00:40:41.253
More carrots please.

893
00:40:41.322 --> 00:40:42.322
Get it in the pan.

894
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.323
Let's go, I need one
more onions Daniel


895
00:40:45.392 --> 00:40:46.489
in the corner, come on.

896
00:40:47.592 --> 00:40:49.558
We don't let people
fail in this kitchen.


897
00:40:49.627 --> 00:40:52.198
There's no heroes
we'd like to say.


898
00:40:52.267 --> 00:40:53.500
You're going down,

899
00:40:53.568 --> 00:40:55.630
I'll be the first person
on the line to dig you out


900
00:40:56.535 --> 00:40:58.039
as long as you tried.

901
00:40:58.108 --> 00:41:00.239
You guys fire seven
more cocktail.


902
00:41:00.308 --> 00:41:02.076
Fire three chicken.

903
00:41:02.145 --> 00:41:04.342
Fire two tomato pizzas please.

904
00:41:04.411 --> 00:41:07.279
This job doesn't end when
the restaurant closes,


905
00:41:07.348 --> 00:41:08.647
it never ends.

906
00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:11.349
There's constant, constant
studying that needs to get done.


907
00:41:11.418 --> 00:41:12.717
And I think the smarter you are

908
00:41:12.786 --> 00:41:15.958
and the more comfortable you
are with food and knowledge


909
00:41:16.027 --> 00:41:19.258
and cooking principles, you
can go wherever you wanna go,


910
00:41:19.327 --> 00:41:20.688
just don't give up.

911
00:41:20.757 --> 00:41:22.393
Good morning to you, welcome.

912
00:41:22.462 --> 00:41:25.396
- We're on our way to
Vic's down in Noho.


913
00:41:26.532 --> 00:41:28.531
Tell me what you love
about this neighborhood?


914
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.844
- I think this neighborhood
still has a little bit


915
00:41:29.868 --> 00:41:34.042
of realness to it especially
on Bowery over here,


916
00:41:34.111 --> 00:41:36.143
but there's such a community.

917
00:41:36.212 --> 00:41:38.673
There's seven to eight
to nine restaurants


918
00:41:38.742 --> 00:41:41.577
in literally half
a block radius.


919
00:41:41.646 --> 00:41:43.315
And it's really nice.

920
00:41:43.384 --> 00:41:44.661
We see each other
in the morning.


921
00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:47.385
We say hi, we all get coffee
at each other's places


922
00:41:47.454 --> 00:41:49.750
and it's a little
family oriented block.


923
00:41:49.819 --> 00:41:51.422
Great Jones is only
two blocks long.


924
00:41:51.491 --> 00:41:52.588
Hey Art.
- Hello.


925
00:41:53.724 --> 00:41:54.523
- Look at this.
- Hi.


926
00:41:54.592 --> 00:41:55.390
- You have quite a bounty today.

927
00:41:55.459 --> 00:41:57.362
- Yeah, what do you have here?

928
00:41:57.431 --> 00:41:58.431
- What do we got?

929
00:41:58.499 --> 00:42:00.068
- We got all this

930
00:42:00.137 --> 00:42:01.201
- Yeah sorry, my bad.

931
00:42:02.337 --> 00:42:04.534
So we got the snap peas
today from Phillips.


932
00:42:04.603 --> 00:42:07.405
I think the most important
thing is grazing at the market.


933
00:42:07.474 --> 00:42:08.506
You gotta eat, right?

934
00:42:08.575 --> 00:42:10.606
But, we have such an
amazing opportunity


935
00:42:10.675 --> 00:42:13.411
to actually taste
food before we buy it.


936
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.746
So we have a whole market.

937
00:42:14.815 --> 00:42:16.822
I mean, this stuff is all
ordered and we go get it,


938
00:42:16.846 --> 00:42:18.090
but if we don't
go to the markets


939
00:42:18.114 --> 00:42:22.057
and actually taste the
food, what say we get home


940
00:42:22.126 --> 00:42:23.355
and these taste like nothing?

941
00:42:23.424 --> 00:42:24.830
- Yeah.
- Sometimes I do feel guilty


942
00:42:24.854 --> 00:42:25.894
if you're grazing too much

943
00:42:25.922 --> 00:42:28.690
of the market like
having breakfast.


944
00:42:28.759 --> 00:42:29.936
- Thank you guys, see you later.

945
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.837
- Especially with berry
season, you can get away


946
00:42:31.861 --> 00:42:32.969
with so many.

947
00:42:34.372 --> 00:42:37.105
- The Jewish delis in
Sheepshead Bay she frequented


948
00:42:37.174 --> 00:42:39.635
as a child are a far cry

949
00:42:39.704 --> 00:42:42.638
from the incredible Italian
dishes she delivers today.


950
00:42:42.707 --> 00:42:46.642
- I grew up in Brooklyn,
two parents, both working.


951
00:42:46.711 --> 00:42:49.381
We did have the pleasure of
having my grandparents living


952
00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:50.482
in the same house.

953
00:42:50.551 --> 00:42:52.747
So they came back and
forth from Florida.


954
00:42:52.816 --> 00:42:55.189
So six months of the year,
the food was different.


955
00:42:55.258 --> 00:42:58.588
My mom wasn't that into
reinventing the wheel,


956
00:42:58.657 --> 00:43:01.261
needless to say in food that's
the nice way of saying it


957
00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:03.098
so we ate a lot of takeout.

958
00:43:03.167 --> 00:43:04.804
We ate a lot of cream
cheese sandwiches.


959
00:43:04.828 --> 00:43:06.443
This is like this one
thing that haunts me still


960
00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:09.071
to this day, but that's
all my parents knew.


961
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.678
It's still the same
neighborhood still


962
00:43:10.702 --> 00:43:11.702
to this day in Brooklyn.

963
00:43:11.736 --> 00:43:13.471
There's no fine
dining out there.


964
00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.308
There's nothing, but
what is still there.


965
00:43:15.377 --> 00:43:17.805
So I think it was more
of like this interest.


966
00:43:17.874 --> 00:43:19.774
My grandparents would
come up from Florida


967
00:43:19.843 --> 00:43:22.150
and then the food
would be different.


968
00:43:22.219 --> 00:43:24.383
The smells in the house
would change every day


969
00:43:24.452 --> 00:43:25.692
and you'd come home from school

970
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.728
and there was something
that I'd never seen before,


971
00:43:27.752 --> 00:43:28.752
I'd never gotten to eat.

972
00:43:28.786 --> 00:43:31.093
But those smells,
it's the smells.


973
00:43:31.162 --> 00:43:32.406
It's my grandmother's
stuffed cabbage.


974
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.097
It's all those things
that kind of intrigued me.


975
00:43:35.166 --> 00:43:36.572
This is a hot commodity
in the kitchen.


976
00:43:36.596 --> 00:43:38.562
Basil, we use so much
basil in the kitchen


977
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:40.465
that as soon as it comes in,

978
00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:42.236
the cooks that need it the most,

979
00:43:42.305 --> 00:43:45.569
they will literally grab
it, hide it and protect it.


980
00:43:45.638 --> 00:43:47.868
- While vacationers
and the New York elite


981
00:43:47.937 --> 00:43:51.245
sipped their cocktails on
the beaches of Montauk,


982
00:43:51.314 --> 00:43:54.116
in her teenage years,
Hillary Sterling worked


983
00:43:54.185 --> 00:43:58.252
in the front of the house at
two busy Long Island hotspots.


984
00:43:58.321 --> 00:44:00.815
- One year I worked in a
breakfast spot in the hotels


985
00:44:00.884 --> 00:44:02.652
on the beach so it
was totally different.


986
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:05.358
And one summer I worked in an
Irish pub called O'Murphy's.


987
00:44:05.427 --> 00:44:06.437
That was a family run restaurant

988
00:44:06.461 --> 00:44:07.768
and I realized that
I do love working


989
00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:09.058
in smaller environments.

990
00:44:09.127 --> 00:44:11.727
After college, I worked at
a bar across from Wrigley


991
00:44:11.796 --> 00:44:14.499
which I have to say was probably
one of my more fun summers.


992
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:16.270
If you know anything
about Cubs fans,


993
00:44:16.339 --> 00:44:18.239
they've never won until
a couple of years ago


994
00:44:18.308 --> 00:44:21.143
so they drank a lot and
they had a lot of fun.


995
00:44:21.212 --> 00:44:23.673
- Hillary had banked
up enough money to travel.


996
00:44:23.742 --> 00:44:26.247
Along the way, she
would discover a dish


997
00:44:26.316 --> 00:44:29.316
that would forever
follow her Cacio e Pepe.


998
00:44:29.385 --> 00:44:31.198
- I was traveling with a
friend from culinary school


999
00:44:31.222 --> 00:44:33.386
and he's like, "I really
wanna go to Milan."


1000
00:44:33.455 --> 00:44:35.355
I'm like, "Amazing, I've
never been to Italy.


1001
00:44:35.424 --> 00:44:37.555
"I have money still, let's go."

1002
00:44:37.624 --> 00:44:38.668
And as we're getting
to the airport,


1003
00:44:38.692 --> 00:44:40.822
he tells me he doesn't
have any money.


1004
00:44:42.233 --> 00:44:43.299
So I got on the plane.

1005
00:44:43.367 --> 00:44:46.498
I found myself traveling
by myself for months


1006
00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:47.366
and I loved it.

1007
00:44:47.435 --> 00:44:48.578
The next day I went and looked

1008
00:44:48.602 --> 00:44:50.700
at the Duomo and I had
no one to look at it


1009
00:44:50.769 --> 00:44:51.878
and be like, "Oh my
God, this is amazing."


1010
00:44:51.902 --> 00:44:53.101
And I was like,

1011
00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:54.782
"Well, I don't need anybody
to say, it's amazing."


1012
00:44:54.806 --> 00:44:56.409
I was like, "This is amazing."

1013
00:44:56.478 --> 00:44:57.575
I met some people.

1014
00:44:57.644 --> 00:44:59.346
I found the hostel chain.

1015
00:44:59.415 --> 00:45:01.843
I went to Rome, I went to
Sorento, I went to Naples.


1016
00:45:01.912 --> 00:45:03.311
I just kept going.

1017
00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:07.585
I started learning about Italian, real
Roman classic food.


1018
00:45:07.654 --> 00:45:10.324
The trifecta as we
call it in the kitchen,


1019
00:45:10.393 --> 00:45:12.491
cacio e pepe, amatriciana
and carbonara.


1020
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.837
And then I started
eating them never knowing


1021
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:18.266
that this is gonna follow
me around forever, forever.


1022
00:45:18.335 --> 00:45:21.269
My lifelong passion
is pasta with pepper.


1023
00:45:21.338 --> 00:45:23.601
In my memory, this was
the beginning of my path


1024
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.867
of falling in love
with Italian food.


1025
00:45:25.936 --> 00:45:30.872
There is a code of cacio e
pepe, no butter, no cream


1026
00:45:32.316 --> 00:45:34.579
and usually there's
no parm either,


1027
00:45:34.648 --> 00:45:37.153
but we break some rules here.

1028
00:45:41.325 --> 00:45:42.691
- Hillary's career was launched

1029
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.823
by working for two iron chefs,
Bobby Flay and Mario Batali.


1030
00:45:49.861 --> 00:45:51.596
- I was actually super lost.

1031
00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:53.664
I remember I was sleeping
on my sister's couch


1032
00:45:53.733 --> 00:45:54.733
on Thompson street.

1033
00:45:54.767 --> 00:45:56.700
I had literally
no idea what to do


1034
00:45:56.769 --> 00:45:58.046
so I was answering
Craigslist ads.


1035
00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:01.606
Christine Sanchez happened
to actually call me back


1036
00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:04.510
and she took a shot
on me at Mesa grill.


1037
00:46:04.579 --> 00:46:07.579
And the chef was out of
town so he kind of showed up


1038
00:46:07.648 --> 00:46:11.385
and I'm just like in his
kitchen not having a clue


1039
00:46:11.454 --> 00:46:12.653
what I was doing.

1040
00:46:12.722 --> 00:46:14.565
Bobby walks in the kitchen,
tastes that cream sauce


1041
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:15.653
and it was totally wrong.

1042
00:46:15.722 --> 00:46:16.885
It was roasted cream sauce.

1043
00:46:16.954 --> 00:46:17.886
I don't know how it was wrong.

1044
00:46:17.955 --> 00:46:19.064
And he's like,
"Did you taste it?"


1045
00:46:19.088 --> 00:46:20.922
And I said, "No."

1046
00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:22.924
I don't know why
I didn't taste it.


1047
00:46:22.993 --> 00:46:25.861
And he looks at me and
he goes, "Never assume."


1048
00:46:26.997 --> 00:46:27.596
And then walked
out of the kitchen.


1049
00:46:27.664 --> 00:46:28.897
He wasn't pleased.

1050
00:46:28.966 --> 00:46:31.801
And I still do line checks
to this day, every day.


1051
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.441
It was a really a rude awakening

1052
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.807
of what New York restaurants
were going to be like


1053
00:46:37.876 --> 00:46:40.843
at that time until
you figured it out.


1054
00:46:40.912 --> 00:46:42.626
It was honestly still
one of my favorite jobs.


1055
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.683
It taught me a lot
about getting along


1056
00:46:45.752 --> 00:46:47.916
with the staff front and
back, being together,


1057
00:46:47.985 --> 00:46:49.218
being in a family.

1058
00:46:49.286 --> 00:46:53.020
It was a restaurant I really
truly loved working in.


1059
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:54.388
After Bolo and Mesa land,

1060
00:46:54.457 --> 00:46:58.564
I went to Lupa for three
years and kind of fell in love


1061
00:46:58.633 --> 00:46:59.932
with that Italian food.

1062
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:04.306
It brought me back to my solo
days of traveling in Italy.


1063
00:47:04.375 --> 00:47:05.274
- Ayesha Nurdjaja stopped by

1064
00:47:05.343 --> 00:47:07.705
to make some pizzas
with Hillary.


1065
00:47:07.774 --> 00:47:11.005
Ayesha runs the Mediterranean
inspired restaurant Shuka.


1066
00:47:11.074 --> 00:47:12.644
She is a fellow lady boss

1067
00:47:12.713 --> 00:47:15.075
and one of Hillary's
most valued friends.


1068
00:47:15.144 --> 00:47:16.144
- When I first started,

1069
00:47:16.178 --> 00:47:18.716
I went to Lidia
Bastianich at Felidia


1070
00:47:18.785 --> 00:47:19.795
which was an amazing experience.

1071
00:47:19.819 --> 00:47:22.016
She had been an
inspiration to me.


1072
00:47:22.085 --> 00:47:22.884
- Through this experience,

1073
00:47:22.953 --> 00:47:25.019
we've found it pretty beautiful

1074
00:47:25.088 --> 00:47:28.990
that a lot of a lot of
us support each other


1075
00:47:29.059 --> 00:47:31.399
through this kind of
crazy thing that we do.


1076
00:47:32.733 --> 00:47:33.465
Are you surprised?

1077
00:47:33.534 --> 00:47:34.614
- I'm not surprised at all.

1078
00:47:34.668 --> 00:47:35.679
I think we should, I
think we should more.


1079
00:47:35.703 --> 00:47:36.746
- A lot of times
we'll go to events


1080
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.834
and there are other
female chefs there


1081
00:47:38.903 --> 00:47:40.519
and then we try our best
introduce ourselves,


1082
00:47:40.543 --> 00:47:41.673
"Hi, my name is Aisha.

1083
00:47:41.742 --> 00:47:42.742
"This is Hillary."

1084
00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:44.643
And then some women
are standoffish.


1085
00:47:44.712 --> 00:47:46.480
And I don't know if
it's a competitive thing


1086
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:49.879
'cause there's such few
women in the culinary field,


1087
00:47:49.948 --> 00:47:51.058
but I think as the days go on

1088
00:47:51.082 --> 00:47:53.047
especially from this
year moving forward,


1089
00:47:53.116 --> 00:47:55.687
there hopefully will be more
of a support for each other.


1090
00:47:55.756 --> 00:47:57.689
- Another prominent
restaurant entrepreneur


1091
00:47:57.758 --> 00:47:58.958
is facing claims of harassment

1092
00:47:59.026 --> 00:48:01.759
as more accusations emerge
against Mario Batali.


1093
00:48:01.828 --> 00:48:04.597
- Mario Batali, the celebrity
chef who has been accused


1094
00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:06.962
by at least nine women
of sexual harassment.


1095
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:09.536
- Mario Batali has
been taken off the show


1096
00:48:09.605 --> 00:48:11.373
amid sexual harassment
allegations.


1097
00:48:11.442 --> 00:48:14.068
- The culture of
our society is changing.


1098
00:48:14.137 --> 00:48:17.445
Mario Batali is at the center
of a major conversation


1099
00:48:17.514 --> 00:48:20.140
about bad behavior
and abusive power.


1100
00:48:20.209 --> 00:48:23.044
I knew coming here that she
had previously worked for him.


1101
00:48:23.113 --> 00:48:25.915
I wondered if she'd
had a similar story.


1102
00:48:25.984 --> 00:48:27.719
- I don't have a
bad word to say.


1103
00:48:29.592 --> 00:48:30.191
I'm a worker.

1104
00:48:30.259 --> 00:48:31.151
I put my head down.

1105
00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.361
I did my job.

1106
00:48:33.464 --> 00:48:35.430
It was an honor to
work for these people


1107
00:48:35.499 --> 00:48:36.971
and during their time
and to be allowed to work


1108
00:48:36.995 --> 00:48:39.962
in the restaurants
and to cook the food.


1109
00:48:40.031 --> 00:48:42.063
I don't have any stories.

1110
00:48:42.132 --> 00:48:43.398
I know it's crazy.

1111
00:48:43.467 --> 00:48:45.177
I don't know how I've gotten
through all these years,


1112
00:48:45.201 --> 00:48:46.969
but I've made it.

1113
00:48:54.551 --> 00:48:57.485
I'm sure some of the
behavior there is valid


1114
00:48:57.554 --> 00:48:58.630
in those people
that felt that way.


1115
00:48:58.654 --> 00:48:59.953
They obviously felt that way

1116
00:49:00.022 --> 00:49:03.425
and they were obviously treated
in a way that wasn't okay.


1117
00:49:03.494 --> 00:49:06.087
I happened to get out
unscathed in this manner,


1118
00:49:06.156 --> 00:49:08.859
but I feel for them if
that's how they felt.


1119
00:49:08.928 --> 00:49:10.696
If you don't feel
comfortable in your job


1120
00:49:10.765 --> 00:49:13.094
and that's how you feel, then
it is our jobs as managers


1121
00:49:13.163 --> 00:49:16.933
and owners and chefs to
help them feel comfortable.


1122
00:49:17.002 --> 00:49:19.507
No one should feel
uncomfortable in their position.


1123
00:49:21.138 --> 00:49:24.578
- So the thing that I
feel like I had to do


1124
00:49:24.647 --> 00:49:27.174
as a young female chef early on

1125
00:49:27.243 --> 00:49:29.682
was kind of develop
a pretty thick skin.


1126
00:49:29.751 --> 00:49:33.213
I have been an out
lesbian since I was,


1127
00:49:33.282 --> 00:49:35.457
I don't know, 20 or
something like that.


1128
00:49:35.526 --> 00:49:36.825
And in the kitchens,

1129
00:49:36.894 --> 00:49:40.154
of course some guy might say
something sort of obnoxious


1130
00:49:40.223 --> 00:49:42.102
and I'd be like, "Please,
have you seen my girlfriend?"


1131
00:49:42.126 --> 00:49:44.598
Or I had a crude cut back then

1132
00:49:44.667 --> 00:49:46.468
and I just looked pretty tough.

1133
00:49:46.537 --> 00:49:47.603
I think I've pretty much

1134
00:49:47.671 --> 00:49:49.471
just had like a don't
fuck with me attitude


1135
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.773
or I will hurt you

1136
00:49:50.841 --> 00:49:53.409
and maybe that's why I took
up sword fighting later.


1137
00:49:54.776 --> 00:49:55.875
Or I just was like,

1138
00:49:55.944 --> 00:49:57.088
"I don't have time for
that kind of bullshit."


1139
00:49:57.112 --> 00:50:00.746
So I just never even
let it come into play.


1140
00:50:00.815 --> 00:50:04.519
I so quickly became
a manager and a boss.


1141
00:50:04.588 --> 00:50:07.016
For me, it was always like
we're not gonna run any kind


1142
00:50:07.085 --> 00:50:08.182
of restaurant like that.

1143
00:50:08.251 --> 00:50:09.451
We're not gonna act like that.

1144
00:50:09.486 --> 00:50:11.889
We're not gonna do anything
that's inappropriate


1145
00:50:11.958 --> 00:50:13.335
because we have so
much work to do.


1146
00:50:13.359 --> 00:50:16.256
And I actually am friends with
pretty much all these guys


1147
00:50:16.325 --> 00:50:17.664
that have gotten in trouble.

1148
00:50:17.733 --> 00:50:19.061
It's a really weird place to be

1149
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:20.174
because it's like,
"Well, wait a minute,


1150
00:50:20.198 --> 00:50:22.834
"I don't even know
you guys like that,


1151
00:50:22.903 --> 00:50:24.144
"but then I thought
you knew the difference


1152
00:50:24.168 --> 00:50:25.837
"between work and play?"

1153
00:50:25.906 --> 00:50:28.268
Because I've been at
parties with Mario


1154
00:50:28.337 --> 00:50:30.743
where he hasn't
been this piggy guy.


1155
00:50:30.812 --> 00:50:32.239
I'm having a hard time with the,

1156
00:50:32.308 --> 00:50:34.648
how could you guys not
know the difference


1157
00:50:34.717 --> 00:50:35.950
between work and play?

1158
00:50:36.018 --> 00:50:38.179
And I wrote this piece about
how it's so frustrating


1159
00:50:38.248 --> 00:50:40.016
because I've had
employees like that


1160
00:50:40.085 --> 00:50:42.117
and I got rid of
them pretty quickly


1161
00:50:42.186 --> 00:50:44.592
because I don't have
time for that crap.


1162
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:47.221
We have so much
to do in our stage


1163
00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:48.334
to make the whole team stop

1164
00:50:48.358 --> 00:50:50.224
and have to get rid
of that player now


1165
00:50:50.293 --> 00:50:53.535
because they said the
wrong thing to the server.


1166
00:50:53.604 --> 00:50:54.848
I just wanna punch those people.

1167
00:50:54.872 --> 00:50:56.583
It's like, come on that's
not what we're doing.


1168
00:50:56.607 --> 00:50:58.001
This is work.

1169
00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:59.970
And we call it work
and we go to work.


1170
00:51:00.039 --> 00:51:03.270
- I think as a mom, one
of my fears for Fatima


1171
00:51:03.339 --> 00:51:07.582
has been it's such a
male oriented industry.


1172
00:51:07.651 --> 00:51:09.947
Fatima of course
just got into it


1173
00:51:10.016 --> 00:51:12.719
because of the love and
passion for cooking.


1174
00:51:12.788 --> 00:51:14.820
Once she went to culinary school

1175
00:51:14.889 --> 00:51:18.659
and she acquired all that
knowledge and technique,


1176
00:51:18.728 --> 00:51:21.827
will others be able to
take her work seriously


1177
00:51:21.896 --> 00:51:25.699
and appreciate what a
creative chef she is


1178
00:51:25.768 --> 00:51:29.769
and that she can be just as
skilled, just as fabulous


1179
00:51:29.838 --> 00:51:33.069
as any other male chef can?

1180
00:51:33.138 --> 00:51:37.612
- Obviously working in New York
City and working at Patina,


1181
00:51:37.681 --> 00:51:42.111
everyone in management
was all male and I wasn't,


1182
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.246
and I was very young.

1183
00:51:43.314 --> 00:51:47.622
And to me, it kind of
fortified the reasons


1184
00:51:47.691 --> 00:51:49.690
why I wanted to make sure

1185
00:51:49.759 --> 00:51:53.023
that I was equal to
everybody over there


1186
00:51:53.092 --> 00:51:55.828
'cause in the back of my
head, I was still so conscious


1187
00:51:55.897 --> 00:51:57.599
about maybe not belonging

1188
00:51:57.668 --> 00:52:02.571
and maybe not having
the same qualifications


1189
00:52:03.872 --> 00:52:05.739
as my male counterparts.

1190
00:52:05.808 --> 00:52:07.334
But the truth is
that if anything,


1191
00:52:07.403 --> 00:52:09.908
I probably was even more
qualified than them.


1192
00:52:09.977 --> 00:52:11.943
- You have to be
like one of the boys.


1193
00:52:12.012 --> 00:52:17.014
You have to be tough,
whatever that means.


1194
00:52:18.183 --> 00:52:19.193
When I first started, I
started at a restaurant


1195
00:52:19.217 --> 00:52:21.722
that was run by a woman

1196
00:52:21.791 --> 00:52:25.627
so I didn't feel that
when I first started out.


1197
00:52:25.696 --> 00:52:30.698
I felt really supportive
female run kitchen.


1198
00:52:31.834 --> 00:52:33.833
Then I moved on and
there might only be one


1199
00:52:33.902 --> 00:52:38.673
or two other women and you
have all of these young men


1200
00:52:40.007 --> 00:52:44.173
who are cooking on the line
and they'll make comments.


1201
00:52:44.242 --> 00:52:47.044
I think some line cook
once called me Barbie chef


1202
00:52:47.113 --> 00:52:49.651
or chef Barbie or
something like that.


1203
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:53.413
People have said to me, "Oh,
you're too pretty to be a chef.


1204
00:52:53.482 --> 00:52:56.119
"You're too small to be a chef."

1205
00:52:56.188 --> 00:53:00.959
Then you have to work that
much harder to prove yourself.


1206
00:53:01.028 --> 00:53:03.390
You're always gonna
come across those cooks,


1207
00:53:03.459 --> 00:53:08.670
those chefs in this industry
who think that you can't do it


1208
00:53:09.806 --> 00:53:10.605
because you're a girl
and you can't do it


1209
00:53:10.674 --> 00:53:12.872
'cause you look a certain way.

1210
00:53:12.941 --> 00:53:17.206
I witnessed and I
experienced people


1211
00:53:17.275 --> 00:53:22.277
who were the harassers not
only not lose their job,


1212
00:53:23.149 --> 00:53:24.752
but not even really get a slap

1213
00:53:24.821 --> 00:53:26.754
on the wrist and get promoted.

1214
00:53:26.823 --> 00:53:30.758
There's no reason to have
so much screaming going on


1215
00:53:30.827 --> 00:53:35.092
in the kitchen and
so much aggressive,


1216
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:38.931
just loud banging
on countertops,


1217
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.065
aggressively throwing plates.

1218
00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:44.970
If I don't have this job,
I won't have another job.


1219
00:53:45.039 --> 00:53:47.236
Nobody will hire me because
I'm such a bad chef.


1220
00:53:47.305 --> 00:53:49.172
I'm such a bad pastry chef.

1221
00:53:49.241 --> 00:53:53.143
Yeah, I felt like my whole
identity is wrapped up in food.


1222
00:53:53.212 --> 00:53:58.214
My whole identity is wrapped
up in baking and cooking


1223
00:53:59.152 --> 00:54:00.485
for my whole entire life.

1224
00:54:00.553 --> 00:54:04.319
And all of a sudden it was
like, "Wow, I'm crap at this."


1225
00:54:08.799 --> 00:54:12.998
That sucks, it sucks.

1226
00:54:14.464 --> 00:54:16.903
It's really hard to
stand up for yourself


1227
00:54:16.972 --> 00:54:20.170
and I definitely didn't.

1228
00:54:20.239 --> 00:54:21.283
I didn't stand up for myself.

1229
00:54:21.307 --> 00:54:22.239
I didn't stand up
for other people.


1230
00:54:22.308 --> 00:54:25.109
I have a ton of
regrets about that.


1231
00:54:25.178 --> 00:54:27.078
I've somehow come
out of all of this


1232
00:54:27.147 --> 00:54:29.212
and I have this platform.

1233
00:54:29.281 --> 00:54:33.018
And so now I have
this responsibility


1234
00:54:33.087 --> 00:54:37.220
to start to speak about
some of this stuff.


1235
00:54:37.289 --> 00:54:42.060
And I think that that's the
way we're gonna make it better


1236
00:54:42.129 --> 00:54:44.425
because this industry
should be really positive.


1237
00:54:44.494 --> 00:54:48.033
- It's just the culture
that a kitchen brings


1238
00:54:48.102 --> 00:54:49.397
that it's just like very macho

1239
00:54:49.466 --> 00:54:51.234
and everyone's always whistling,

1240
00:54:52.876 --> 00:54:55.403
but it's also like for me,
I was always just like,


1241
00:54:55.472 --> 00:54:57.977
"Well, you need to be
able to handle that too."


1242
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:03.081
- I used to just stand
there and always say,


1243
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:04.383
"Yes chef, yes chef."

1244
00:55:04.451 --> 00:55:07.921
Whatever they said, it
doesn't matter how bad it is.


1245
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:11.925
They throwing dish in your face

1246
00:55:11.994 --> 00:55:13.004
and then you always
have to say yes chef


1247
00:55:13.028 --> 00:55:15.291
because you don't
wanna lose the job.


1248
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.272
- I think it's a really interesting point
that you bring up


1249
00:55:17.296 --> 00:55:20.329
where you kind of have
to accept this culture


1250
00:55:20.398 --> 00:55:23.805
in a kitchen where
men are catcalling you


1251
00:55:23.874 --> 00:55:25.207
and whistling at you.

1252
00:55:25.275 --> 00:55:26.319
And at the end of the night,
you get out of your chef's coat


1253
00:55:26.343 --> 00:55:28.337
and you put on a
cute dress to get out


1254
00:55:28.406 --> 00:55:29.205
and go and have some drinks.

1255
00:55:29.274 --> 00:55:30.006
And everybody's like.

1256
00:55:30.074 --> 00:55:31.007
- You mean normal looking?

1257
00:55:31.075 --> 00:55:34.046
- Yeah, yeah, I
mean, we are women.


1258
00:55:34.115 --> 00:55:37.346
We're allowed to be pretty
in dresses with makeup on


1259
00:55:37.415 --> 00:55:38.614
and men just need to accept

1260
00:55:38.683 --> 00:55:41.152
that we could still be
bad-asses in the kitchen.


1261
00:55:41.221 --> 00:55:44.254
- Okay so, the biggest
thing is for me,


1262
00:55:44.323 --> 00:55:48.093
I remember walking into any
kitchen that I work especially


1263
00:55:48.162 --> 00:55:49.228
for the first time

1264
00:55:49.296 --> 00:55:52.229
and you just have to
have to accept or expect


1265
00:55:52.298 --> 00:55:57.300
that you're just gonna be
harassed like crazy by everyone.


1266
00:55:58.634 --> 00:56:00.315
In those younger days, it
was my mentality to just


1267
00:56:00.339 --> 00:56:04.439
be able to have thick skin
and be okay with that.


1268
00:56:04.508 --> 00:56:06.441
- Fight back.
- Not even fight,


1269
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:08.245
you just accept it
and just be like,


1270
00:56:08.314 --> 00:56:09.884
okay, they're gonna do it again.

1271
00:56:09.953 --> 00:56:10.618
It's just like,
it is what it is.


1272
00:56:10.687 --> 00:56:12.381
- I don't, I fight back.

1273
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:13.450
- You fight back?

1274
00:56:13.484 --> 00:56:14.495
- Honestly, fighting
back just gets-


1275
00:56:14.519 --> 00:56:16.858
- Worse, worse.
- Yeah, it gets worse


1276
00:56:16.927 --> 00:56:19.927
or super exhausting and
you just need to ignore it.


1277
00:56:19.996 --> 00:56:24.833
And I feel like I remember
telling other females.


1278
00:56:25.936 --> 00:56:27.573
They're like, "Oh,
don't you get all weird


1279
00:56:27.597 --> 00:56:29.530
"when these guys do that?"

1280
00:56:29.599 --> 00:56:31.565
And you're just like,
"Well, we're so used to it


1281
00:56:31.634 --> 00:56:32.533
"so it's whatever."

1282
00:56:32.602 --> 00:56:34.634
- Yeah, that's so sad.

1283
00:56:34.703 --> 00:56:37.340
It's so sad that at some point,

1284
00:56:37.409 --> 00:56:40.211
we've had to accept that
as females in the kitchen.


1285
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.579
But me personally,

1286
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:44.985
I feel like as I got more
confident working in a kitchen


1287
00:56:45.054 --> 00:56:47.889
and I realized I'm not gonna
let these guys push me around.


1288
00:56:47.958 --> 00:56:49.397
If somebody said something
to me, I'd be like,


1289
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:50.892
"Shut the fuck up."

1290
00:56:50.961 --> 00:56:51.560
"Who are you?

1291
00:56:51.628 --> 00:56:52.628
"Leave me alone."

1292
00:56:52.696 --> 00:56:55.061
Just because I'm a
chick doesn't mean


1293
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.274
that you could
treat me like that.


1294
00:56:56.298 --> 00:57:00.902
- There are 20 males in
the kitchens of course


1295
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:04.235
and it's only two
females in that kitchen.


1296
00:57:04.304 --> 00:57:08.239
And of course, it feel like
ridiculous and not confident


1297
00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.606
to work with them, then I
have to push myself even more


1298
00:57:12.675 --> 00:57:15.642
to prove that hey I can do it.

1299
00:57:15.711 --> 00:57:18.887
- It's funny that every female
kind of has that experience.


1300
00:57:24.621 --> 00:57:26.368
- There's a couple of guys
that it took me a really,


1301
00:57:26.392 --> 00:57:30.063
really long time to get
them to accept the fact


1302
00:57:30.132 --> 00:57:31.933
that I was A, was a woman,

1303
00:57:32.002 --> 00:57:33.594
B, that I'd only
worked there a year


1304
00:57:33.663 --> 00:57:37.301
and I was being
promoted past them.


1305
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.875
Eventually, I got the
guys but it took a while.


1306
00:57:41.242 --> 00:57:42.553
You'd wanna walk out of
there and cry and be like,


1307
00:57:42.577 --> 00:57:46.112
"I can't believe these guys
just tortured me all day."


1308
00:57:46.181 --> 00:57:49.346
But for some people,
they'll walk away from that,


1309
00:57:49.415 --> 00:57:51.546
for other people, I was
like, Goddammit, no way,


1310
00:57:51.615 --> 00:57:53.416
no way are these
guys gonna break me.


1311
00:57:53.485 --> 00:57:56.991
- I didn't feel like
I was good enough


1312
00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.359
to call myself a chef yet.

1313
00:57:58.428 --> 00:58:02.194
I hadn't sweated out in the
kitchen of a restaurant yet.


1314
00:58:02.263 --> 00:58:03.965
It was very difficult
for me to do that.


1315
00:58:04.034 --> 00:58:05.275
- She was always at
the top of her class


1316
00:58:05.299 --> 00:58:06.409
with the cooking and everything,

1317
00:58:06.433 --> 00:58:08.464
but she would be like,
"No, my food sucks.


1318
00:58:08.533 --> 00:58:09.732
"I don't know."

1319
00:58:09.801 --> 00:58:12.336
But we'll be like, "Esther,
you're way too humble.


1320
00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:15.438
"Get over it, your
food is really amazing.


1321
00:58:15.507 --> 00:58:16.507
"You're very talented."

1322
00:58:16.575 --> 00:58:18.144
And we always had
to push that to her.


1323
00:58:18.213 --> 00:58:21.114
- It's hard and as women,

1324
00:58:21.183 --> 00:58:23.545
I think that one of
my biggest struggles


1325
00:58:23.614 --> 00:58:25.514
is definitely the
confidence issue.


1326
00:58:25.583 --> 00:58:28.187
I've always had that issue.

1327
00:58:28.256 --> 00:58:29.991
I just don't feel
like I'm good enough.


1328
00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.224
- I had a guy once that we
had a radio in the kitchen,


1329
00:58:32.293 --> 00:58:34.589
in my kitchen it
doesn't exist anymore.


1330
00:58:34.658 --> 00:58:37.262
I like it nice and
quiet and peaceful.


1331
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:40.430
And at the end of service,
he hopped up on the table,


1332
00:58:40.499 --> 00:58:44.599
sat down on the table, put
the music on, still cooking.


1333
00:58:44.668 --> 00:58:47.767
And I asked him to not do that.

1334
00:58:47.836 --> 00:58:50.671
And next night, same
time, same thing.


1335
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.739
Next night, same
time, same thing


1336
00:58:52.808 --> 00:58:57.315
until eventually he understood
that I had earned my title


1337
00:58:57.384 --> 00:58:59.218
of a sous chef and
I could still cook


1338
00:58:59.287 --> 00:59:01.055
and I was still just
as good as he was.


1339
00:59:01.124 --> 00:59:02.629
The first couple of days,
I got really mad about it.


1340
00:59:02.653 --> 00:59:03.886
And I was like,

1341
00:59:03.954 --> 00:59:04.965
"I don't understand why
he's not listening to me."


1342
00:59:04.989 --> 00:59:05.921
And then I kind
of had to delve in


1343
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:09.261
and figure out
where the line was?


1344
00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:13.463
What he needed from me and
what he wanted to see from me?


1345
00:59:13.532 --> 00:59:15.399
And then to earn my title

1346
00:59:15.468 --> 00:59:18.072
and to actually for
him to respect them.


1347
00:59:18.141 --> 00:59:21.141
- But don't you think that
that's female perspective


1348
00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:22.443
to earn the title?

1349
00:59:22.511 --> 00:59:24.288
Because I mean, the last
time I took over a kitchen


1350
00:59:24.312 --> 00:59:25.456
was three years ago and
I felt the same way.


1351
00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.543
I had earned the title
when I first got there.


1352
00:59:27.612 --> 00:59:29.578
And the first thing I did
was I started to clean


1353
00:59:29.647 --> 00:59:31.745
because the kitchen was
just not to my standard


1354
00:59:31.814 --> 00:59:32.846
and what I wanted to do.

1355
00:59:32.915 --> 00:59:34.226
And then I was doing
all the butchering


1356
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:36.651
and showing each person that
I can work each station.


1357
00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.786
And I feel like another person
can walk into that kitchen


1358
00:59:39.855 --> 00:59:40.954
and then visit the chef,

1359
00:59:41.023 --> 00:59:43.262
And then from day one,
it starts to go from.


1360
00:59:43.331 --> 00:59:44.473
I think that's a
female perspective.


1361
00:59:44.497 --> 00:59:45.641
- Another person meaning a man?

1362
00:59:45.665 --> 00:59:48.465
- A man can walk into
their kitchen and say,


1363
00:59:49.766 --> 00:59:51.381
"We're changing the menu
today and this is what it is."


1364
00:59:51.405 --> 00:59:53.734
Not even say what my name is.

1365
00:59:53.803 --> 00:59:56.308
I really think that that's
a female perspective


1366
00:59:56.377 --> 00:59:57.377
of how to do things.

1367
00:59:57.411 --> 00:59:58.655
I don't think it's
wrong or right,


1368
00:59:58.679 --> 01:00:00.023
I'm just saying that that's
what my experience was.


1369
01:00:00.047 --> 01:00:04.085
- The younger you are, the
kind of more insecure you are


1370
01:00:04.154 --> 01:00:05.548
as a female in this male world.

1371
01:00:05.617 --> 01:00:06.617
And I think as you do it,

1372
01:00:06.651 --> 01:00:07.962
you do become a
lot more confident


1373
01:00:07.986 --> 01:00:10.652
and you do understand I'm
gonna get respect from people


1374
01:00:10.721 --> 01:00:13.622
by showing them what to do,
by showing them I can hang.


1375
01:00:13.691 --> 01:00:16.427
And I wonder if a male thinks
the same thing when he comes


1376
01:00:16.496 --> 01:00:17.762
into the kitchen?

1377
01:00:17.831 --> 01:00:22.169
- He probably doesn't, but
that's what separates us.


1378
01:00:23.305 --> 01:00:25.238
Some cooks really like
working for women,


1379
01:00:25.307 --> 01:00:26.734
some cooks obviously don't.

1380
01:00:26.803 --> 01:00:30.276
But I think I have a breed

1381
01:00:30.345 --> 01:00:33.180
of cooks in here
that are sensitive,


1382
01:00:33.249 --> 01:00:34.889
they're caring and
they help each other.


1383
01:00:34.943 --> 01:00:38.350
And that machismo attitude
doesn't really fit


1384
01:00:38.419 --> 01:00:39.485
in here very well.

1385
01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:40.631
- That's the environment
that you've created.


1386
01:00:40.655 --> 01:00:43.652
- So those guys don't
last here very long


1387
01:00:43.721 --> 01:00:44.798
and it's not because of me,

1388
01:00:44.822 --> 01:00:46.787
it's because of the
other staff members.


1389
01:00:46.856 --> 01:00:49.295
If you can't fit in
and respect the kitchen


1390
01:00:49.364 --> 01:00:50.803
that they believe
in and working in,


1391
01:00:50.827 --> 01:00:52.126
then there's no place for you.

1392
01:00:52.195 --> 01:00:57.336
- I feel for women, it's easier
to get intimidated by men.


1393
01:00:59.209 --> 01:01:01.274
When she was still in college,

1394
01:01:01.343 --> 01:01:03.144
she'd be weeping and crying.

1395
01:01:03.213 --> 01:01:06.147
And I still remember one
conversation I had with her


1396
01:01:06.216 --> 01:01:08.809
and she said, mom,
"There's this one chef.


1397
01:01:08.878 --> 01:01:10.514
"He asked us to put
a steak together.


1398
01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:15.123
"He took a bite of it
and he threw the plate


1399
01:01:16.259 --> 01:01:18.687
"and he said, 'What's
this shoe-leather?'"


1400
01:01:20.263 --> 01:01:22.790
- The more confident you have
in your craft and your skill,


1401
01:01:23.761 --> 01:01:25.166
the more that you're working,

1402
01:01:25.235 --> 01:01:26.475
the more your repertoire grows,

1403
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.664
all those things
come full circle.


1404
01:01:28.733 --> 01:01:33.735
And you're able to basically
exist in your space creatively


1405
01:01:35.377 --> 01:01:36.710
as a chef

1406
01:01:36.778 --> 01:01:39.213
and not worry too much about
what's happening around you.


1407
01:01:39.282 --> 01:01:41.446
- You don't learn by sort
of just taking in advice.


1408
01:01:41.515 --> 01:01:45.450
I think that you learn
by sort of example,


1409
01:01:45.519 --> 01:01:47.782
people setting examples for you.

1410
01:01:47.851 --> 01:01:50.191
And that's certainly
how I've learned.


1411
01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.490
I don't always see things
sort of in black and white,


1412
01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:54.492
but you're right,
there is a sense,


1413
01:01:54.561 --> 01:01:55.827
there is a different energy,

1414
01:01:55.896 --> 01:01:59.332
I feel like when you have
sort of a mixed team, right?


1415
01:01:59.401 --> 01:02:00.333
It's not just all boys.

1416
01:02:00.402 --> 01:02:01.768
It's not just all girls.

1417
01:02:01.837 --> 01:02:05.701
And I feel like you wanna sort
of strike the right balance.


1418
01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:07.835
And it could be all female,
it could be all male,


1419
01:02:07.904 --> 01:02:10.673
but it has to be one
that is based on respect.


1420
01:02:10.742 --> 01:02:13.874
And I think that the
culture of restaurants


1421
01:02:13.943 --> 01:02:18.714
and sort of cooking in general
has been very throw a fight


1422
01:02:18.783 --> 01:02:21.783
if that is a word that I
could is very sort of dude,


1423
01:02:23.326 --> 01:02:27.426
tough guys throwing
pans, swearing a lot,


1424
01:02:27.495 --> 01:02:29.527
sexist, racist jokes it's okay

1425
01:02:29.596 --> 01:02:31.859
and there's an absolute
disregard for sort of humanity


1426
01:02:31.928 --> 01:02:33.663
when you really look into it.

1427
01:02:33.732 --> 01:02:35.863
So I'm a little bit more
protective I would say


1428
01:02:35.932 --> 01:02:38.602
of my cooks, female cooks.

1429
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:40.439
You have to watch yourself

1430
01:02:40.508 --> 01:02:44.278
and you have to protect
yourself and know your rights


1431
01:02:44.347 --> 01:02:46.610
and really seek a place
'cause you don't need all


1432
01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:48.777
that macho to cook
well, you don't.


1433
01:02:48.846 --> 01:02:52.847
- And for every place that does
treat their cooks like that,


1434
01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:54.149
there's a place

1435
01:02:54.217 --> 01:02:56.422
that treats their cooks
like you treat your cooks.


1436
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:58.754
So that was something
that I learned


1437
01:02:58.823 --> 01:03:01.020
was how to find those places

1438
01:03:01.089 --> 01:03:02.809
where I was gonna be
treated with respect.


1439
01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.926
- Because I feel like honestly,
this might sound cheesy,


1440
01:03:05.995 --> 01:03:10.832
but a happy, respectful
place produces food


1441
01:03:10.901 --> 01:03:13.868
that is more delicious
than one that is filled


1442
01:03:13.937 --> 01:03:17.410
with antagonism,
and anger and rage.


1443
01:03:17.479 --> 01:03:18.519
- Yeah, and food is love.

1444
01:03:18.547 --> 01:03:20.743
You can't cook good
food without love.


1445
01:03:20.812 --> 01:03:23.911
- But then, that is too sort
of female to talk that way.


1446
01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:24.779
You know what I mean?

1447
01:03:24.848 --> 01:03:27.981
And I think even women's chefs,

1448
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:30.555
they sort of take
on a persona of,


1449
01:03:30.624 --> 01:03:32.689
if I'm gonna survive
in this kitchen,


1450
01:03:32.758 --> 01:03:34.856
I have to walk a
little bit like this


1451
01:03:34.925 --> 01:03:36.825
and I have to sort of be hard

1452
01:03:36.894 --> 01:03:41.434
and yell like the
best chefs out there.


1453
01:03:41.503 --> 01:03:44.239
It's that kind of
crazy mentality


1454
01:03:45.001 --> 01:03:46.200
that I knew long time ago

1455
01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:48.441
that I didn't want to
have anything to do with.


1456
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.443
I mean, don't we
all wanna be treated


1457
01:03:50.512 --> 01:03:53.677
with respect and kindness?

1458
01:03:54.846 --> 01:03:56.779
But at the same time,
I'm not talking soft.


1459
01:03:56.848 --> 01:03:57.848
You know what I mean?

1460
01:03:57.916 --> 01:03:59.193
Opposite of hard
doesn't have to be soft.


1461
01:03:59.217 --> 01:04:02.653
It could be disciplined,
it could be well managed.


1462
01:04:02.722 --> 01:04:06.426
And it's about sharing
knowledge, passing on knowledge,


1463
01:04:07.727 --> 01:04:10.397
All of that doesn't
have to be hard at all.


1464
01:04:11.896 --> 01:04:14.599
- That my love for
food and preparing food


1465
01:04:14.668 --> 01:04:17.965
and serving the food,
those are all elements


1466
01:04:18.034 --> 01:04:19.034
of being a chef.

1467
01:04:19.068 --> 01:04:20.737
It's not just being
able to cook it,


1468
01:04:20.806 --> 01:04:22.607
but loving to serve it.

1469
01:04:22.676 --> 01:04:26.875
Being able to say this
comes from my heritage


1470
01:04:26.944 --> 01:04:29.515
and I want to share
this with you.


1471
01:04:29.584 --> 01:04:32.947
- Being a chef isn't
really just about food.


1472
01:04:33.016 --> 01:04:35.851
To be a successful chef is
more about your environment


1473
01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.492
and about your kitchen,
and it's about your staff,


1474
01:04:39.561 --> 01:04:40.823
it's about being a leader.

1475
01:04:40.892 --> 01:04:43.023
And what makes an
incredible leader?


1476
01:04:43.092 --> 01:04:45.729
There's no male or female.

1477
01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:47.009
A good leader is a good leader.

1478
01:04:47.033 --> 01:04:51.438
Why do I have to be
labeled as a female chef?


1479
01:04:51.507 --> 01:04:52.239
I'm just a chef.

1480
01:04:52.308 --> 01:04:53.902
I can do whatever you do.

1481
01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:57.411
Don't look at me
like, I'm lesser


1482
01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.973
or I can't do a certain thing

1483
01:04:59.042 --> 01:05:01.844
because of my size
or the way I look.


1484
01:05:03.717 --> 01:05:05.024
- We just wanna
be in the same category.


1485
01:05:05.048 --> 01:05:06.354
- Yeah.
- - Yeah.


1486
01:05:08.986 --> 01:05:12.558
- If you're in a place in a
restaurant working for somebody


1487
01:05:12.627 --> 01:05:16.760
or somebody's acting
inappropriate, bring it up,


1488
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:20.665
talk about it or get out if
it's not the right place.


1489
01:05:20.734 --> 01:05:24.867
There's so many other restaurants that
need your talent


1490
01:05:24.936 --> 01:05:26.696
so you don't have to
put up with that stuff.


1491
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.036
- What would you
give advice for a woman


1492
01:05:29.105 --> 01:05:32.006
who was dealing with something
like that in the workplace?


1493
01:05:34.748 --> 01:05:35.748
- "Is this Chef Fatima?"

1494
01:05:35.815 --> 01:05:39.178
I'm like, "Yes."

1495
01:05:39.247 --> 01:05:40.247
And she was like,

1496
01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:41.592
"Hi I was actually
doing some research


1497
01:05:41.616 --> 01:05:43.469
"and your name popped up
and we're actually casting


1498
01:05:43.493 --> 01:05:44.559
"for the next season.

1499
01:05:44.627 --> 01:05:45.867
"I would really love
if you could join us


1500
01:05:45.891 --> 01:05:47.494
"for the next season."

1501
01:05:47.563 --> 01:05:48.362
- Oh my God.

1502
01:05:48.431 --> 01:05:50.497
- And I was just like, "What?"

1503
01:05:50.566 --> 01:05:51.576
I didn't even know
what the fuck to say.


1504
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.665
I was like, "Wait,
you want me to?"


1505
01:05:58.035 --> 01:05:59.875
No, she wants me to be
one of the contestants.


1506
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:04.655
She's like, "Yes and I'm gonna
send you all the paper work."


1507
01:06:04.679 --> 01:06:06.719
She's like, "Just talk to
me for like five minutes.


1508
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.679
"I would love to
know more about you."


1509
01:06:07.748 --> 01:06:10.011
And she's all
energetic and shit.


1510
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.346
My fucking heart is pounding.

1511
01:06:11.415 --> 01:06:12.558
I was like, "Oh my God, you
gotta be fucking kidding."


1512
01:06:12.582 --> 01:06:14.620
I was like, "I can't do
"Top Chef" right now.


1513
01:06:14.689 --> 01:06:15.755
- I feel blessed

1514
01:06:15.823 --> 01:06:17.821
that I got to spend the
day with Fatima Ali.


1515
01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:20.956
- Don't worry,
you'll warm into it.


1516
01:06:21.024 --> 01:06:22.727
- At the time we
filmed with her,


1517
01:06:22.796 --> 01:06:24.597
she shared with us her story

1518
01:06:28.065 --> 01:06:29.602
from getting on "Chopped".

1519
01:06:31.134 --> 01:06:32.233
- I was 21 at the time

1520
01:06:32.302 --> 01:06:34.739
and I didn't think I was
even close to capable


1521
01:06:34.808 --> 01:06:35.918
of doing something like that.

1522
01:06:35.942 --> 01:06:37.742
I tried out for the
show, went on the show,


1523
01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:39.073
ended up winning by a fluke

1524
01:06:39.142 --> 01:06:41.240
and that kind of opened up

1525
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:44.683
this whole other
aspect to cooking.


1526
01:06:44.752 --> 01:06:47.114
I really want to be
that Pakistani girl


1527
01:06:47.183 --> 01:06:48.819
that other Pakistani
girls can look at


1528
01:06:48.888 --> 01:06:50.701
and be like, "You know
what, I can do it too."


1529
01:06:50.725 --> 01:06:53.021
- To meeting
her hero Padma Lakshmi.


1530
01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:55.122
- One of the shows that
I watched growing up


1531
01:06:55.191 --> 01:06:56.860
was Padma Lakshmi's show.

1532
01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:58.664
She had this travel show

1533
01:06:58.733 --> 01:07:00.765
where she would go
around through India


1534
01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:04.065
and sit with all
of these villagers


1535
01:07:04.134 --> 01:07:05.467
and kind of recreate recipes.

1536
01:07:05.535 --> 01:07:09.675
And I thought that it was so
fascinating to watch someone


1537
01:07:09.744 --> 01:07:12.139
who looked like me being able
to do this in her country.


1538
01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:15.175
And it made me so
hopeful to think


1539
01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:16.913
that maybe one day
I could do that too.


1540
01:07:16.982 --> 01:07:18.684
I was obsessed.

1541
01:07:18.753 --> 01:07:20.620
She was actually
the only brown woman


1542
01:07:20.689 --> 01:07:22.556
on that cooking channel.

1543
01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:25.020
She's opened a lot of doors
in a lot of different ways


1544
01:07:25.089 --> 01:07:27.528
and I want her to
like my food, I do.


1545
01:07:27.597 --> 01:07:29.189
I want her to
respect me as a chef.


1546
01:07:29.258 --> 01:07:32.126
Before I knew it, I was
accepted onto the new season.


1547
01:07:32.195 --> 01:07:34.568
Was told we were gonna
be flying to Colorado.


1548
01:07:34.637 --> 01:07:39.639
Had never been there before and
was just incredibly nervous.


1549
01:07:40.742 --> 01:07:41.971
Hi Padma, hi Tom, hi.

1550
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.269
- What did you make for us?

1551
01:07:43.338 --> 01:07:45.546
It'd be an avalanche,
do it, do it.


1552
01:07:48.145 --> 01:07:50.749
That charred padi
feeling in here.


1553
01:07:50.818 --> 01:07:52.850
- Being able to watch
someone on TV growing up


1554
01:07:52.919 --> 01:07:53.995
and then getting to meet them

1555
01:07:54.019 --> 01:07:55.314
and actually have a relationship

1556
01:07:55.383 --> 01:07:57.151
with them was really wonderful.

1557
01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.559
The more they tasted my food,

1558
01:07:58.628 --> 01:07:59.427
the more they understood

1559
01:07:59.496 --> 01:08:01.155
what I was trying to accomplish.

1560
01:08:01.224 --> 01:08:02.864
And I thought that
was really heartening


1561
01:08:02.896 --> 01:08:04.961
and it was definitely
a confidence booster.


1562
01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:08.701
I was just having so much
fun challenging myself


1563
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:11.231
in these kinds of
like dire straits.


1564
01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.332
I love that kind of chaos

1565
01:08:13.401 --> 01:08:15.675
and I love that adrenaline rush.

1566
01:08:15.744 --> 01:08:18.678
I've always been
pretty competitive.


1567
01:08:28.317 --> 01:08:33.528
- To watch Fatima grow
into this extremely skilled


1568
01:08:38.998 --> 01:08:41.866
and crafty chef who comes up

1569
01:08:41.935 --> 01:08:44.737
with the most
innovative recipes,


1570
01:08:44.806 --> 01:08:49.709
who has taken her inspiration

1571
01:08:49.778 --> 01:08:54.780
and influences from her
cultural heritage and background


1572
01:08:56.213 --> 01:09:01.182
and what she grew up with and
taken all the fabulous things


1573
01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:05.824
that she's learned
in college working


1574
01:09:05.893 --> 01:09:07.991
with all these wonderful chefs,

1575
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.828
taken French techniques

1576
01:09:11.327 --> 01:09:16.329
and kind of amalgamated
and collaborated everything


1577
01:09:17.102 --> 01:09:18.435
and put it together

1578
01:09:18.503 --> 01:09:23.237
and has come up with a whole
new world of Pakistani food.


1579
01:09:27.112 --> 01:09:31.311
And that is what makes
me super proud as a mom.


1580
01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.919
That's actually been a
wonderful thing to watch,


1581
01:09:36.055 --> 01:09:39.121
to see her grow into
such a talented chef.


1582
01:09:41.456 --> 01:09:42.322
- Thanks mom.

1583
01:09:42.391 --> 01:09:45.160
- Yeah, there we go.

1584
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:49.032
- Yeah, I was really excited
about having the show air,


1585
01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:51.738
making plans to possibly think

1586
01:09:51.807 --> 01:09:54.972
about opening up a
restaurant in New York.


1587
01:09:56.812 --> 01:09:57.544
There were a lot of things

1588
01:09:57.613 --> 01:09:58.653
that I was looking forward

1589
01:09:58.681 --> 01:10:02.815
to doing once we
wrapped up with filming.


1590
01:10:02.884 --> 01:10:05.213
The day after I landed
in New York, I got a call


1591
01:10:05.282 --> 01:10:08.854
from my aunt who needed
my help taking care


1592
01:10:08.923 --> 01:10:10.443
of my grandmother
who had fallen ill.


1593
01:10:10.485 --> 01:10:12.451
While I was staying with her,

1594
01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.158
I noticed that there was an
ache in my left shoulder.


1595
01:10:17.866 --> 01:10:20.141
I was sleeping in one of those
hospital's recliner chairs.


1596
01:10:20.165 --> 01:10:21.328
I hadn't been exercising.

1597
01:10:21.397 --> 01:10:23.396
And so I shrugged it off.

1598
01:10:23.465 --> 01:10:27.268
So about August of

1599
01:10:27.337 --> 01:10:29.743
while I was working
there at the U.S. open,


1600
01:10:29.812 --> 01:10:33.912
I had a huge VIP table that I
was cooking fresh pasta for.


1601
01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:37.113
And while I was flipping
this pan of pasta,


1602
01:10:37.182 --> 01:10:41.722
the ache in my shoulder just
grew exponentially overnight.


1603
01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:43.856
My shoulder had
swollen up so much


1604
01:10:43.925 --> 01:10:47.288
that the bartender was handing
me a bag of ice to put on it.


1605
01:10:47.357 --> 01:10:49.730
And he took one look
at me and he was like,


1606
01:10:49.799 --> 01:10:51.094
"Chef, your shoulder is huge.

1607
01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:52.496
"You should go to a doctor."

1608
01:10:52.564 --> 01:10:57.166
And that took me about three
days to get to an orthopedic.


1609
01:10:57.235 --> 01:11:01.071
And he took one look at me
during his physical exam.


1610
01:11:02.405 --> 01:11:06.109
I burst into tears 'cause
I was in so much pain


1611
01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:08.474
that he knew something
wasn't right.


1612
01:11:08.543 --> 01:11:11.983
And he got me an MRI
that very same day.


1613
01:11:12.052 --> 01:11:15.019
He thought it was a good
idea for me to call someone


1614
01:11:15.088 --> 01:11:16.757
from my family to
help me through


1615
01:11:16.826 --> 01:11:21.190
because he had this
strange feeling


1616
01:11:21.259 --> 01:11:25.832
that it might be more serious
than he was anticipating.


1617
01:11:25.901 --> 01:11:29.902
And I'll never forget
hanging up the phone


1618
01:11:29.971 --> 01:11:32.432
and kind of being numb
and being really scared


1619
01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:37.712
that something really ominous
might be in my future.


1620
01:11:39.079 --> 01:11:41.441
And I called my brother who
was in Sydney, Australia.


1621
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:42.609
He told me not to worry

1622
01:11:42.678 --> 01:11:44.917
that he was gonna get
on the next flight over.


1623
01:11:44.986 --> 01:11:47.315
He called my mom who was in
Palm Springs at the time.


1624
01:11:47.384 --> 01:11:51.220
And we ended up going to see
this oncologist in Long Island,


1625
01:11:51.289 --> 01:11:53.453
but my mom was
just not convinced,


1626
01:11:53.522 --> 01:11:54.621
call it a mother's instinct

1627
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:57.226
that she just wanted to
get a second opinion.


1628
01:11:57.295 --> 01:11:59.129
And thankfully, we got
that second opinion


1629
01:11:59.198 --> 01:12:01.395
from doctors at Memorial
Sloan Kettering.


1630
01:12:01.464 --> 01:12:04.904
In the meantime, I
started losing sensation


1631
01:12:04.973 --> 01:12:07.005
in the left side of my face.

1632
01:12:08.306 --> 01:12:11.075
My brother and my mom just
knew that they had to rush me


1633
01:12:11.144 --> 01:12:12.410
to the emergency room

1634
01:12:12.479 --> 01:12:16.377
and thankfully they did at
Memorial Sloan Kettering.


1635
01:12:16.446 --> 01:12:18.478
We got there at
five in the morning.


1636
01:12:18.547 --> 01:12:21.250
And within five
days I was sitting


1637
01:12:21.319 --> 01:12:23.186
with my now oncologist.

1638
01:12:23.255 --> 01:12:24.891
His name was Dr. Wexler.

1639
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.204
And he was holding
my hand telling me


1640
01:12:26.228 --> 01:12:30.864
that I had sarcoma, which
was a malignant tumor.


1641
01:12:30.933 --> 01:12:35.935
And being 28,
healthy, a non-smoker,


1642
01:12:39.007 --> 01:12:41.270
getting a cancer diagnosis
is just something


1643
01:12:41.339 --> 01:12:43.976
that nobody can prepare you for.

1644
01:12:44.045 --> 01:12:48.915
Hair loss, infertility,
weight gain, weight loss,


1645
01:12:48.984 --> 01:12:51.280
hot flashes, early
menopause, you name it.


1646
01:12:51.349 --> 01:12:52.426
He's going for all
of these things


1647
01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:54.090
and I'm just nodding
my head going like,


1648
01:12:54.154 --> 01:12:54.919
"Okay, I can deal with that.

1649
01:12:54.988 --> 01:12:56.989
"Okay, I can deal with that."

1650
01:12:57.058 --> 01:12:58.859
And I just had one
question for him.


1651
01:12:58.928 --> 01:13:00.004
I looked at him and I was like,

1652
01:13:00.028 --> 01:13:01.323
"Am I gonna lose my eyebrows?"

1653
01:13:01.392 --> 01:13:03.152
And he looked at me and
he was like, "Yeah."


1654
01:13:03.196 --> 01:13:06.064
And I burst into tears.

1655
01:13:06.133 --> 01:13:09.067
To me, that was just like
such an emotional thing


1656
01:13:09.136 --> 01:13:14.138
for me to have to go through
being 28 and not knowing


1657
01:13:16.209 --> 01:13:17.944
what was gonna
happen in my life.


1658
01:13:30.454 --> 01:13:32.189
Yeah, it's a lot.

1659
01:13:51.508 --> 01:13:54.376
- Oh, it's been very difficult.

1660
01:13:54.445 --> 01:13:59.447
It's been extremely
intense, very devastating


1661
01:14:00.253 --> 01:14:01.253
for us as a family.

1662
01:14:03.157 --> 01:14:07.158
I think there are days
when it's just tough


1663
01:14:20.075 --> 01:14:21.942
to see her go through it.

1664
01:14:22.011 --> 01:14:23.438
It's not been easy,

1665
01:14:26.675 --> 01:14:28.707
but she's a real fighter.

1666
01:14:28.776 --> 01:14:33.987
She's a trooper,
she hasn't given up.


1667
01:14:35.552 --> 01:14:38.959
And I guess being
a chef like I said,


1668
01:14:39.028 --> 01:14:40.620
food is such a comforting thing

1669
01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:45.262
for her that even through
her journey with cancer,


1670
01:14:45.331 --> 01:14:49.233
she continues to go
back to either cooking


1671
01:14:50.534 --> 01:14:55.536
and even eating her food.

1672
01:14:56.639 --> 01:14:59.111
I'm sorry I got distracted.

1673
01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.300
- No, it's okay, it's okay.

1674
01:15:01.809 --> 01:15:07.020
- But, it's been difficult
for us as a family.


1675
01:15:08.519 --> 01:15:10.287
It came as a huge shock.

1676
01:15:10.356 --> 01:15:11.420
- Let's be realistic.

1677
01:15:11.489 --> 01:15:13.994
She is not an ordinary person.

1678
01:15:14.063 --> 01:15:17.261
She is very, very
strong in a lot of ways


1679
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:19.934
which you have never
seen her before.


1680
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:24.367
So that's her.

1681
01:15:24.436 --> 01:15:27.601
And she's quite
unique in that sense.


1682
01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:35.083
- Thank you.

1683
01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:41.285
- And it's been a rough
road for all of us,


1684
01:15:41.354 --> 01:15:43.617
but we're nearly there now.

1685
01:15:43.686 --> 01:15:48.292
So I'm hoping that
it will be behind us.


1686
01:15:48.361 --> 01:15:51.625
- It's something that
doesn't leave you,


1687
01:15:53.399 --> 01:15:56.762
but it's something that you
kind of get used to every day.


1688
01:15:56.831 --> 01:15:58.368
I'm definitely not
the same person


1689
01:15:58.437 --> 01:16:01.239
that I was before I was
diagnosed with cancer,


1690
01:16:02.804 --> 01:16:08.015
but it makes you
really appreciate


1691
01:16:09.415 --> 01:16:12.283
so many things about your life.

1692
01:16:12.352 --> 01:16:15.187
It's been a really
tough journey for me.


1693
01:16:15.256 --> 01:16:16.533
It's been a really tough journey

1694
01:16:16.557 --> 01:16:21.325
for my family, but now that
having gone through that


1695
01:16:22.461 --> 01:16:24.328
and seeing the light at
the end of the tunnel,


1696
01:16:24.397 --> 01:16:29.036
almost being done with
treatment, yeah it's amazing.


1697
01:16:30.502 --> 01:16:33.469
I've been incredibly lucky having the kind
of support system


1698
01:16:33.538 --> 01:16:36.340
that I have around me during
this really horrible time


1699
01:16:36.409 --> 01:16:39.673
in my life and that
has made it impossible


1700
01:16:39.742 --> 01:16:43.413
for me to be anything
but positive.


1701
01:16:43.482 --> 01:16:46.218
Just having all these wonderful
people around me pushes me


1702
01:16:46.287 --> 01:16:47.615
to make sure that I'm okay.

1703
01:16:49.653 --> 01:16:52.554
I have to believe that
everything will work out


1704
01:16:52.623 --> 01:16:56.294
because I truly
believe that it will.


1705
01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:29.591
- New York,
please welcome Fatima Ali.


1706
01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.363
- So in July I had clear scans.

1707
01:17:32.432 --> 01:17:36.235
I was technically cancer-free
and I had this weird ache


1708
01:17:36.304 --> 01:17:39.865
in my left hip after
we moved to Los Angeles


1709
01:17:39.934 --> 01:17:42.406
and I had this nagging feeling
that something wasn't right.


1710
01:17:42.475 --> 01:17:44.474
So we went back to New York,

1711
01:17:44.543 --> 01:17:47.642
got another PET scan and
my doctor sat us down


1712
01:17:47.711 --> 01:17:49.842
and they were like,
"Look, the cancer's back.


1713
01:17:49.911 --> 01:17:53.549
"It's metastasized, the
chemo has not worked."


1714
01:17:53.618 --> 01:17:55.749
And I looked at my
doctor and I was like,


1715
01:17:55.818 --> 01:17:57.619
"Tell me straight,
how long do I have?"


1716
01:17:57.688 --> 01:17:59.456
And he's like, "A year."

1717
01:18:00.757 --> 01:18:01.821
It's a lot.

1718
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:03.034
- Yeah, that's a lot to hear.

1719
01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:06.496
- Well, I get to cross
this off my bucket list.


1720
01:18:06.565 --> 01:18:08.432
This is huge.

1721
01:18:08.501 --> 01:18:11.336
Honestly, I have so many
restaurants I wanna go


1722
01:18:11.405 --> 01:18:12.405
to around Europe.

1723
01:18:12.473 --> 01:18:13.617
You're obviously
invited so is Portia.


1724
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:18.178
And go to Italy, go to
France, go to Spain,


1725
01:18:18.247 --> 01:18:20.444
go to South Africa,
go on a Safari.


1726
01:18:20.513 --> 01:18:21.775
So many things I want to do.

1727
01:18:34.329 --> 01:18:35.690
It tastes like water.

1728
01:18:35.759 --> 01:18:36.658
- You said the other day,

1729
01:18:36.727 --> 01:18:37.804
when you were
talking to friends,


1730
01:18:37.828 --> 01:18:43.236
you were like, "It
doesn't feel like me.


1731
01:18:47.738 --> 01:18:49.605
"I'm watching these things."

1732
01:18:50.774 --> 01:18:54.346
- Yeah well, it doesn't
feel like much my life.


1733
01:18:54.415 --> 01:18:55.743
Yeah, it doesn't.

1734
01:18:55.812 --> 01:18:57.349
- So what does it feel like?

1735
01:18:57.418 --> 01:18:59.219
- I know all these
things have happened


1736
01:18:59.288 --> 01:19:04.257
and I know I've done them,
but it's like, I don't know.


1737
01:19:09.298 --> 01:19:12.430
It doesn't feel like
it's still my life.


1738
01:19:12.499 --> 01:19:14.300
I watch these
clips, like I said,


1739
01:19:14.369 --> 01:19:16.731
I know that isn't me.

1740
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:22.572
I may know what that feels like.

1741
01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:27.808
I know what it felt like
to be in that moment,


1742
01:19:29.318 --> 01:19:32.417
but I don't know, it
just doesn't feel real.


1743
01:19:33.817 --> 01:19:35.849
People say the
craziest things to me


1744
01:19:35.918 --> 01:19:37.917
and I'm like, "I'm not that."

1745
01:19:37.986 --> 01:19:43.197
It's like I don't feel
like what they're saying.


1746
01:19:44.333 --> 01:19:45.566
- What are they saying?

1747
01:19:45.634 --> 01:19:46.711
- Because they're like,
"You're such an inspiration."


1748
01:19:46.735 --> 01:19:48.928
And all these really,
really nice things


1749
01:19:48.997 --> 01:19:54.208
and in my head I'm just
like, "I'm just me."


1750
01:20:00.811 --> 01:20:03.217
I just said and did
whatever I thought.


1751
01:20:05.486 --> 01:20:07.045
Being in the
moment, being myself


1752
01:20:07.114 --> 01:20:11.522
so it just feels like
even more of a fraud.


1753
01:20:11.591 --> 01:20:13.425
I just feel like
even more of a fraud.


1754
01:20:13.494 --> 01:20:14.360
- You feel like a fraud?

1755
01:20:14.428 --> 01:20:15.691
Why?

1756
01:20:17.597 --> 01:20:19.431
Why do you feel like a fraud?

1757
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.499
- Because, I don't know,

1758
01:20:24.373 --> 01:20:26.801
I'm not an inspiration.

1759
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:30.475
- But you can't
say you're an inspiration


1760
01:20:30.544 --> 01:20:31.872
or you can't decide that.

1761
01:20:32.942 --> 01:20:34.578
That's not how it works.

1762
01:20:34.647 --> 01:20:37.350
When you look ahead,
does anybody inspire you?


1763
01:20:39.014 --> 01:20:40.024
- Lots of people inspire me.

1764
01:20:40.048 --> 01:20:41.081
- And what do you think,

1765
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:42.160
they wake up every
morning and be like,


1766
01:20:42.184 --> 01:20:46.656
"I don't wanna be
an inspiration."


1767
01:20:46.725 --> 01:20:49.494
- No.
- "Or I'm trying


1768
01:20:49.563 --> 01:20:51.463
"to be an inspiration."

1769
01:21:13.147 --> 01:21:16.521
- It's hard to
talk about someone


1770
01:21:17.987 --> 01:21:22.362
that isn't with us
anymore that we lost.


1771
01:21:23.729 --> 01:21:27.664
I don't even think there are
words to describe the amount


1772
01:21:27.733 --> 01:21:31.063
of aspiration that can
be drawn from her story.


1773
01:21:31.132 --> 01:21:33.373
- She was incredible
on so many levels.


1774
01:21:33.442 --> 01:21:35.402
First and foremost, it's
just one of those people


1775
01:21:35.444 --> 01:21:38.510
who instantly when you met,

1776
01:21:38.579 --> 01:21:40.644
you were like just a magnet.

1777
01:21:40.713 --> 01:21:43.042
She was just an
absolute magnetic person


1778
01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:44.648
to the truest degree of it.

1779
01:21:44.717 --> 01:21:47.783
- She's special, she sparkles.

1780
01:21:47.852 --> 01:21:52.491
Her spirit, her energy,
it draws you in.


1781
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.527
- It's hard, she
was one of a kind.


1782
01:21:55.596 --> 01:21:57.793
- She was talented, she
was fierce, she was funny,


1783
01:21:57.862 --> 01:21:59.630
she was beautiful.

1784
01:21:59.699 --> 01:22:02.094
She was absolutely,

1785
01:22:03.197 --> 01:22:06.604
but I think that's what
made her great too.


1786
01:22:06.673 --> 01:22:09.002
- She's a beautiful
ball with contradiction.


1787
01:22:09.071 --> 01:22:11.840
She's a tomboy, but she's girly.

1788
01:22:11.909 --> 01:22:15.547
She's fearless, but she
still questions for herself.


1789
01:22:15.616 --> 01:22:20.420
She is wise and mature,
but she's still excited


1790
01:22:20.489 --> 01:22:22.422
about life and
learning new things


1791
01:22:22.491 --> 01:22:23.918
and experiencing the world.

1792
01:22:24.922 --> 01:22:27.086
She's ambitious and driven,

1793
01:22:27.155 --> 01:22:28.956
but still just
wants to spend time


1794
01:22:29.025 --> 01:22:31.992
at home with her family and
the people that she loves.


1795
01:22:32.061 --> 01:22:37.063
- She was the strongest,
strongest person I know.


1796
01:22:38.232 --> 01:22:40.836
- She is truly the
best of all of us


1797
01:22:40.905 --> 01:22:44.642
and everything that we can
hope to be as human beings.


1798
01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:48.613
- She never had it easy
and took everything


1799
01:22:48.682 --> 01:22:53.211
with a smile and with
strength and with positivity.


1800
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.589
So I think that shows
how powerful her life was


1801
01:22:57.658 --> 01:23:02.121
that she was able to
keep it shining no matter


1802
01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:07.401
how dark it was becoming.

1803
01:23:08.768 --> 01:23:11.088
- We had somehow found each
other in this life as friends.


1804
01:23:11.672 --> 01:23:13.165
It was a very kismet thing

1805
01:23:13.234 --> 01:23:17.741
and we loved her like
our own, like our sister.


1806
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:22.482
And she's unreplaceable and
we just had the privilege


1807
01:23:22.551 --> 01:23:25.485
and the burden of trying
to carry on her legacy,


1808
01:23:25.554 --> 01:23:27.652
carrying on everything she did

1809
01:23:27.721 --> 01:23:30.050
and I hope we make her proud.

1810
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:40.698
- So thank you so much
Padma for taking some time


1811
01:23:40.767 --> 01:23:42.766
to chat about Fatima.

1812
01:23:42.835 --> 01:23:44.801
You know Fatima
mentioned in many places


1813
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:48.035
that you were a big
influence and hero on her.


1814
01:23:48.104 --> 01:23:49.674
How do you feel about that?

1815
01:23:49.743 --> 01:23:51.874
- I'm happy she saw me that way.

1816
01:23:51.943 --> 01:23:56.945
I'm sad that I am the only
one she saw for so long.


1817
01:23:58.312 --> 01:24:01.785
I had my own version of that
and so I'm always flattered.


1818
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:05.118
I'm always pleased
that I could do that


1819
01:24:05.187 --> 01:24:08.088
for Fatima especially.

1820
01:24:09.598 --> 01:24:12.598
She just was such a bright
light in the kitchen.


1821
01:24:13.866 --> 01:24:14.866
I was flattered.

1822
01:24:14.934 --> 01:24:16.932
- And then she gets
this horrible news


1823
01:24:17.001 --> 01:24:18.868
that she's got sarcoma.

1824
01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.035
What was your reaction to that?

1825
01:24:21.104 --> 01:24:23.301
- I mean, I was devastated.

1826
01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:28.581
I have to tell you I can
count on one hand the amount


1827
01:24:29.882 --> 01:24:34.246
of South Asian contestants
we've had across all the seasons


1828
01:24:35.349 --> 01:24:36.081
of "Top Chef".

1829
01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:37.249
Not only because of that,

1830
01:24:37.318 --> 01:24:42.188
but because she was such
a special human being


1831
01:24:42.257 --> 01:24:43.490
and it just seems so cruel

1832
01:24:43.558 --> 01:24:46.962
because she was so young
and she had so much going


1833
01:24:47.031 --> 01:24:50.504
for her and it's never the
boring ones that cancer gets.


1834
01:24:53.235 --> 01:24:57.038
It's always these sort
of bright, charismatics,


1835
01:24:57.107 --> 01:24:58.303
special, special people.

1836
01:24:58.372 --> 01:24:59.171
And Fatima was like that.

1837
01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:02.582
She had a great sense of humor.

1838
01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:07.653
She was witty and whip smart
and a pleasure to have around.


1839
01:25:08.921 --> 01:25:12.119
And you couldn't look
at her smiling face


1840
01:25:12.188 --> 01:25:13.857
without smiling yourself.

1841
01:25:13.926 --> 01:25:16.189
- Just so you know
what happened.


1842
01:25:16.258 --> 01:25:19.093
It came back and
then we lost her.


1843
01:25:19.998 --> 01:25:21.964
- It was terrible.

1844
01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:26.331
It was absolutely devastating.

1845
01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.709
And when we heard that
the cancer had spread,


1846
01:25:33.946 --> 01:25:36.209
I kinda knew that was the end.

1847
01:25:36.278 --> 01:25:39.014
Then I came to the
hospital a few times.


1848
01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:43.623
I met her sisters and they're
such a wonderful family


1849
01:25:43.692 --> 01:25:45.350
and they reminded
me of my family.


1850
01:25:45.419 --> 01:25:48.023
I saw that look of worry

1851
01:25:48.092 --> 01:25:50.388
for your child that I saw
on Fatima's mother's face.


1852
01:25:50.457 --> 01:25:54.326
I saw it on my own mother's
face when I had a car accident.


1853
01:25:54.395 --> 01:25:55.661
I know that look.

1854
01:25:55.730 --> 01:26:00.233
It's the look of a mother
who feels completely helpless


1855
01:26:00.302 --> 01:26:03.643
and no mother should ever feel
that way about their child.


1856
01:26:04.405 --> 01:26:07.075
I grew to be really fond

1857
01:26:07.144 --> 01:26:11.783
of her parents and
her brother Mohammad.


1858
01:26:11.852 --> 01:26:16.854
And I came to see Fatima as
kind of a younger sister.


1859
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.926
I'm very close to my family

1860
01:26:22.995 --> 01:26:25.995
and my cousins function
like my siblings,


1861
01:26:26.064 --> 01:26:27.898
but here was a sister
in the kitchen.


1862
01:26:27.967 --> 01:26:30.197
But then when I got
to know her family


1863
01:26:30.266 --> 01:26:35.268
and her again under these
very extreme circumstances,


1864
01:26:36.173 --> 01:26:37.908
I kind of fell in love with her.

1865
01:26:37.977 --> 01:26:40.812
And I guess I saw
my younger self


1866
01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:45.047
in her too and I wanted her
to have the opportunities


1867
01:26:45.116 --> 01:26:47.819
that maybe I hadn't had or women

1868
01:26:47.888 --> 01:26:50.184
in my generation didn't have.

1869
01:26:50.253 --> 01:26:53.726
And I'm just sorry she
didn't get that chance.


1870
01:26:53.795 --> 01:26:57.224
Fatima may have been
inspired in her life


1871
01:26:57.293 --> 01:27:01.426
by me again, which is super
flattering and such an honor


1872
01:27:01.495 --> 01:27:03.835
but in the end of her life,

1873
01:27:03.904 --> 01:27:05.738
she was quite inspiring

1874
01:27:05.807 --> 01:27:10.402
in the way she trudged
forward full steam ahead


1875
01:27:10.471 --> 01:27:13.273
and made plans, started writing

1876
01:27:13.342 --> 01:27:18.212
because she was in a
hospital bed, went on Ellen,


1877
01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:23.118
did whatever she could to
remain active in the face


1878
01:27:23.187 --> 01:27:28.189
of such monumental opposition
because of her cancer.


1879
01:27:30.931 --> 01:27:31.764
I'm just sad.

1880
01:27:31.833 --> 01:27:33.132
I think about her.

1881
01:27:33.201 --> 01:27:37.803
I look at pictures of her and
she had so much possibility


1882
01:27:40.204 --> 01:27:42.841
and she saw so much possibility.

1883
01:27:44.208 --> 01:27:48.011
This is a girl who grew up in
a school in Pakistan saying,


1884
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.309
"I wanna be on "Top Chef".

1885
01:27:49.378 --> 01:27:51.311
And then she's on "Top Chef".

1886
01:27:53.822 --> 01:27:56.481
This is a girl who
admired Susan Sarandon


1887
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:59.418
and somehow she got to
meet Susan Sarandon.


1888
01:27:59.487 --> 01:28:00.720
And then she got to go

1889
01:28:00.788 --> 01:28:03.389
on "The Ellen Show" and
she was a force of nature.


1890
01:28:03.458 --> 01:28:08.229
And I'm just sorry that
cancer took her away


1891
01:28:08.298 --> 01:28:11.298
from us so early.

1892
01:28:11.367 --> 01:28:15.907
Really, what can you
say about a 27 year old


1893
01:28:15.976 --> 01:28:20.043
who gets Ewing sarcoma who
hasn't really had a chance


1894
01:28:20.112 --> 01:28:21.814
to spread her wings?

1895
01:28:21.883 --> 01:28:24.377
That she was kind,
that she was funny


1896
01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.150
that she was a good writer,
that she loved really hard


1897
01:28:28.219 --> 01:28:31.956
and was very warm and there
for all her friends and family,


1898
01:28:32.025 --> 01:28:33.551
that she was a magical thinker

1899
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:37.060
and made you laugh all the time.

1900
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:40.129
- Everyone at home who
voted for fan favorite,


1901
01:28:40.198 --> 01:28:40.863
I have good news.

1902
01:28:40.932 --> 01:28:41.964
I'm announcing it now.

1903
01:28:42.033 --> 01:28:45.002
The winner and the
recipient of $10,000


1904
01:28:45.071 --> 01:28:48.236
is Fatima Ali!

1905
01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:52.878
- I think the most
important thing


1906
01:28:54.509 --> 01:28:58.114
for female chefs in general is
just to build each other up.


1907
01:28:58.183 --> 01:28:59.951
I think having that
kind of network


1908
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.482
and reaching out to one another
and having the opportunity


1909
01:29:03.551 --> 01:29:06.155
to collaborate is so important.

1910
01:29:06.224 --> 01:29:10.060
And that's the only way we
can become better and rise up.


1911
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:12.898
And I think that's the
most exciting thing


1912
01:29:12.967 --> 01:29:16.363
is having the kind
of infrastructure


1913
01:29:16.432 --> 01:29:18.431
all around the world really,

1914
01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:22.468
having these really fantastic
female chefs helming kitchens


1915
01:29:22.537 --> 01:29:25.845
and being able to use
each other as resources.


1916
01:29:25.914 --> 01:29:30.047
- My inspiration, I
know this is so cheesy,


1917
01:29:31.183 --> 01:29:33.611
but I have to say
it, it's my grandma.


1918
01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.151
How can it not be?

1919
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.548
She taught me how to love food.

1920
01:29:36.617 --> 01:29:38.550
She taught me how
to cook for people.


1921
01:29:38.619 --> 01:29:41.861
- In her heart, family
is really precious to her


1922
01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:43.196
that's number one.

1923
01:29:43.265 --> 01:29:46.327
In our culture, it's very
hard to express verbally,


1924
01:29:46.396 --> 01:29:49.000
but we know from how
they look at her,


1925
01:29:49.069 --> 01:29:52.399
how they treat her,
it's like beyond words.


1926
01:29:52.468 --> 01:29:54.170
It's amazing what
she accomplished


1927
01:29:54.239 --> 01:29:55.842
and I'm very proud of her too.

1928
01:29:57.539 --> 01:29:58.539
- Thank you.

1929
01:30:00.476 --> 01:30:01.476
I was a nobody.

1930
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:03.476
I didn't really
have chef friends


1931
01:30:03.545 --> 01:30:06.116
or industry people or whatever.

1932
01:30:06.185 --> 01:30:07.484
I was just so young.

1933
01:30:07.553 --> 01:30:11.924
It was hard because I had to
make the mistakes to learn.


1934
01:30:11.993 --> 01:30:14.894
And I guess that's sort
of my personality too.


1935
01:30:14.963 --> 01:30:15.762
I'm very stubborn.

1936
01:30:15.831 --> 01:30:17.897
I just have to
do it my own way

1937
01:30:17.966 --> 01:30:20.394
and figure it out because
I feel like you have


1938
01:30:20.463 --> 01:30:23.166
to make every
experience your own.


1939
01:30:23.235 --> 01:30:26.103
Somehow I managed to
put something together.


1940
01:30:27.239 --> 01:30:29.502
- I would definitely say
that The Edge was born


1941
01:30:29.571 --> 01:30:33.913
from Juliet and
myself taking a leap.


1942
01:30:33.982 --> 01:30:36.146
There's this quote, "Leap
and the net will appear."


1943
01:30:36.215 --> 01:30:38.049
Thank goodness the net appeared

1944
01:30:38.118 --> 01:30:40.216
'cause we leaped off the cliff.

1945
01:30:40.285 --> 01:30:44.055
And I think you don't have
all your ducks in a row


1946
01:30:44.124 --> 01:30:48.125
but you take risks
and chances anyway.


1947
01:30:48.194 --> 01:30:49.633
Of course, you try
to be as organized


1948
01:30:49.657 --> 01:30:52.327
as possible and as
researched as possible,


1949
01:30:52.396 --> 01:30:55.231
but sometimes you're not
completely clear on what it is


1950
01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:57.970
that you want to do and
how you wanna do it,


1951
01:30:58.039 --> 01:31:01.237
but you just have to
throw yourself into it.


1952
01:31:01.306 --> 01:31:06.275
I will say that I'm
tremendously proud of my sister.


1953
01:31:07.378 --> 01:31:09.641
I also have been
humbled by the fact


1954
01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:12.611
that she did always
tell me that it's okay,


1955
01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.812
this is gonna work out

1956
01:31:13.881 --> 01:31:14.925
and we're gonna do
something great together.


1957
01:31:14.949 --> 01:31:18.023
She led the way to
create this space.


1958
01:31:18.092 --> 01:31:20.355
It has been an
absolute joy to watch.


1959
01:31:20.424 --> 01:31:23.127
- I can't imagine having this
place now without Justine.


1960
01:31:23.196 --> 01:31:26.460
I mean, she's such an
integral part of the everyday


1961
01:31:26.529 --> 01:31:29.001
of the restaurant and
feeling the way it feels


1962
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:33.137
and she's the most
trusted person in my life.


1963
01:31:33.206 --> 01:31:35.469
Tell each other,
honestly and truthfully


1964
01:31:35.538 --> 01:31:37.504
when things go wrong or right.

1965
01:31:37.573 --> 01:31:40.375
She's the person I can
celebrate this with


1966
01:31:40.444 --> 01:31:42.344
and she's on the
battlefield with me


1967
01:31:42.413 --> 01:31:46.084
and I couldn't ask for
a better person to be


1968
01:31:46.153 --> 01:31:47.452
on the battlefield with me.

1969
01:31:47.521 --> 01:31:52.321
I mean, this is my sister who
is not my twin but my twin.


1970
01:31:54.425 --> 01:31:55.666
- And then they cleaned
the green beans.


1971
01:31:55.690 --> 01:31:57.029
There's no tops on them?

1972
01:31:57.725 --> 01:31:59.691
Fuck yeah, it's green bean time.

1973
01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.375
I just said fuck yeah,
it's green bean time.


1974
01:32:01.399 --> 01:32:03.937
Totally 100%, it's amazing.

1975
01:32:05.106 --> 01:32:06.446
Who's more excited
about green beans?


1976
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:07.769
Obviously we are.

1977
01:32:07.838 --> 01:32:11.241
I've worked alongside some
amazing chefs and restaurateurs.


1978
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:13.078
And maybe not by coincidence,

1979
01:32:13.147 --> 01:32:15.542
some of the hardest
working most innovative


1980
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:18.083
and passionate among
them have been women.


1981
01:32:18.152 --> 01:32:20.151
Missy Robbins is a
woman that stands behind


1982
01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.486
what she believes in.

1983
01:32:21.555 --> 01:32:25.156
The importance of ingredients,
the integrity of flavor


1984
01:32:25.225 --> 01:32:27.719
and the delivery of
honoring tradition in tandem


1985
01:32:27.788 --> 01:32:30.359
with authentic
Italian hospitality.


1986
01:32:30.428 --> 01:32:31.627
To this day,

1987
01:32:31.696 --> 01:32:33.692
we still exchange recipes
and stories of travel.


1988
01:32:35.235 --> 01:32:36.773
For that matter, one of the
greatest things about working


1989
01:32:36.797 --> 01:32:39.203
with Vicki Freeman is
her love of travel,


1990
01:32:39.272 --> 01:32:41.040
her love of exploration

1991
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:43.702
and her love of finding
the next best thing.


1992
01:32:43.771 --> 01:32:47.277
Whether it's something new
or a time honored tradition


1993
01:32:47.346 --> 01:32:49.180
at risk of being lost,

1994
01:32:49.249 --> 01:32:52.117
Vicky is always a proponent
of capturing the wisdom


1995
01:32:52.186 --> 01:32:56.451
of travel so that we can take
that back to the restaurants


1996
01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:01.258
and learn, teach, and share
that inspiration with our teams.


1997
01:33:02.130 --> 01:33:04.360
I love travel so much.

1998
01:33:04.429 --> 01:33:06.527
It has become one of
my greatest teachers.


1999
01:33:07.795 --> 01:33:10.366
I think part of our
industry that is so special


2000
01:33:10.435 --> 01:33:14.469
is this kind of education,
the constant vulnerability


2001
01:33:14.538 --> 01:33:17.340
and the constant
growth it brings.


2002
01:33:17.409 --> 01:33:18.409
- My career has taken

2003
01:33:18.443 --> 01:33:21.212
this interesting
full circle path,


2004
01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:23.709
which I don't think is,

2005
01:33:23.778 --> 01:33:27.086
if it happens for you, great,
if it doesn't, that's great.


2006
01:33:27.155 --> 01:33:31.222
I started with Sohui at The
Good Fork over a decade ago


2007
01:33:31.291 --> 01:33:35.754
and I did this big kind of
circle and she was always there


2008
01:33:35.823 --> 01:33:38.460
as a mentor for me
throughout the whole thing.


2009
01:33:38.529 --> 01:33:43.531
Returning to her kitchen, it's
such a sense of homecoming.


2010
01:33:45.866 --> 01:33:47.667
It's not about me saying,

2011
01:33:47.736 --> 01:33:49.636
"Hey, when you met me,
I didn't know anything


2012
01:33:49.705 --> 01:33:52.540
"and look at me
now a decade later,


2013
01:33:52.609 --> 01:33:55.708
"I'm this chef and I
know all this stuff."


2014
01:33:55.777 --> 01:33:59.811
I just wanna show her how
important that relationship


2015
01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.912
is to me.

2016
01:34:00.981 --> 01:34:05.784
That mentorship, it'll
make your career.


2017
01:34:05.853 --> 01:34:10.756
I'm emotional about it because
it's those good mentors,


2018
01:34:10.825 --> 01:34:12.494
we owe them everything.

2019
01:34:12.563 --> 01:34:14.331
And if I can do
that for somebody,


2020
01:34:16.435 --> 01:34:19.270
that will be better than
anything I ever cook.


2021
01:34:27.215 --> 01:34:29.148
- I mean, we've never
worked together before,


2022
01:34:29.217 --> 01:34:30.349
we just ate together.

2023
01:34:30.418 --> 01:34:32.811
And it's just one
meeting planning the menu


2024
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.550
and we make all things happen.

2025
01:34:35.619 --> 01:34:37.816
So I said the more the merrier

2026
01:34:37.885 --> 01:34:41.226
and whoever said
girls can't get along?


2027
01:34:41.295 --> 01:34:42.524
- That's just crazy.

2028
01:34:42.593 --> 01:34:43.525
I've never heard that.

2029
01:34:43.594 --> 01:34:44.760
I honestly think that

2030
01:34:44.829 --> 01:34:46.606
that comes from women
having to be so competitive


2031
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:47.727
in a man's world.

2032
01:34:49.666 --> 01:34:50.431
For so many years,

2033
01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.666
people have grown up thinking

2034
01:34:52.735 --> 01:34:53.879
there's not enough room for me.

2035
01:34:53.903 --> 01:34:55.900
There's only gonna be
one woman at this event


2036
01:34:55.969 --> 01:34:57.869
and that's not true anymore.

2037
01:34:57.938 --> 01:34:59.421
So we don't have to
act like that anymore.


2038
01:34:59.445 --> 01:35:01.180
- Cool.
- Cheers.


2039
01:35:01.249 --> 01:35:04.183
- Cheers, let's rule the world!

2040
01:35:04.252 --> 01:35:06.944
- It actually boils down to a
very simple, chefy kind of way


2041
01:35:07.013 --> 01:35:08.079
of thinking for me.

2042
01:35:08.147 --> 01:35:12.587
I've seen so much and
I've evolved so much


2043
01:35:12.656 --> 01:35:14.919
in this business and
television shows,


2044
01:35:14.988 --> 01:35:19.726
and restaurants and seasonality,
different environments.


2045
01:35:19.795 --> 01:35:20.894
It kind of comes down

2046
01:35:20.963 --> 01:35:25.732
to I said I like female
sort of nurtured food.


2047
01:35:26.538 --> 01:35:27.604
And I think what I mean

2048
01:35:27.672 --> 01:35:30.473
by that is not
necessarily just a gender,


2049
01:35:30.542 --> 01:35:32.772
but I like the sensitivity

2050
01:35:32.841 --> 01:35:36.710
that maybe we've just
sort of put on females,


2051
01:35:36.779 --> 01:35:38.481
but I actually love
so many ingredients


2052
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:40.351
and so many different
kinds of people.


2053
01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:43.717
And I think about it as if
I'm at the farmer's market


2054
01:35:43.786 --> 01:35:46.522
and there's all these
varietals of heirloom tomatoes


2055
01:35:46.591 --> 01:35:48.227
and I don't have a favorite one.

2056
01:35:48.296 --> 01:35:49.462
I just like all of them

2057
01:35:49.531 --> 01:35:52.594
because they're all
unique and all so special.


2058
01:35:53.928 --> 01:35:54.938
And so now I'm gonna have
to buy like 20 of them


2059
01:35:54.962 --> 01:35:59.964
because I wanna
celebrate all of it.


2060
01:36:00.033 --> 01:36:04.177
For me, that's exactly what
we should look at people like,


2061
01:36:05.544 --> 01:36:08.973
and food and all of our
traditions and innovativeness.


2062
01:36:09.042 --> 01:36:10.876
There's a lot of
information here


2063
01:36:10.945 --> 01:36:15.386
and we need to celebrate and
take care of that angle of it


2064
01:36:15.455 --> 01:36:17.520
because that actually is
the most important thing


2065
01:36:17.589 --> 01:36:19.654
about the planet.

2066
01:36:19.723 --> 01:36:21.920
- You plan a lot.

2067
01:36:21.989 --> 01:36:24.791
You're sitting over there,
you make plans for your life.


2068
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:26.529
You make plans for your work,

2069
01:36:26.598 --> 01:36:29.664
plans to open up a
restaurant, plans to travel.


2070
01:36:29.733 --> 01:36:32.029
And sometimes you just don't get

2071
01:36:32.098 --> 01:36:34.537
that timeline the
way you wanted it.


2072
01:36:34.606 --> 01:36:35.805
And I think for me,

2073
01:36:35.874 --> 01:36:38.002
the biggest takeaway from
this whole experience


2074
01:36:38.071 --> 01:36:40.411
is that you just got to do it

2075
01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.679
and it's just really pushed
me to make things happen now.


2076
01:36:44.748 --> 01:36:45.981
When I was younger,

2077
01:36:46.049 --> 01:36:48.551
I think I always had all
these big dreams in my head


2078
01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.752
and I was maybe a little bit
hesitant to always follow them,


2079
01:36:51.821 --> 01:36:54.887
but there's no
holding back anymore.


2080
01:36:56.496 --> 01:36:59.991
- This is the story of
a woman and her name is Chef.
