1
00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:08.445
Twelve-year-old boy
driving an automobile.


2
00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:11.706
l think your father's
as much to blame as you.


3
00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:13.317
Father don't know about it.

4
00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:17.650
-You said you had permission.
-l did. l got permission from Eddie Cooper.


5
00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:19.985
-lt's his car.
-His car?


6
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.185
You mean it was his car.
Now it's a pile of junk.


7
00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:27.561
And a law-abiding farmer's tractor
is damaged to the extent of $30.


8
00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:31.565
So, Mr. James MacMahon, Jr...

9
00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:35.538
...this court sentences you to 90 days.

10
00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:39.144
Ninety days, Mr. Watkins, of working
for you after school.


11
00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:43.806
Weeding turnips or sawing wood or any
other form of labor to make up your loss.


12
00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:47.544
Jimmy, you tell your father
about this mess.


13
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.156
Dad? He'd just about
skin me alive.


14
00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:54.418
l vaguely suspected
something of that sort.


15
00:01:57.597 --> 00:02:01.966
This court will recess for 30 minutes
while l try a case in chambers.


16
00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.939
Am l late, judge?
l came the minute l got your call.


17
00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:16.912
That's quite all right, Mary.
Quite all right. Sit down.


18
00:02:17.517 --> 00:02:19.246
Now....

19
00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:22.546
The way this thing
looks to me...


20
00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:25.250
...it appears that you...

21
00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:30.453
...Mrs. Harry Tompkins, purchased an
expensive radio on an installment plan.


22
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.532
lt appears, Mary, that you're three months
in arrears in the payments.


23
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.191
l thought l could pay
from the household money.


24
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.634
The store wants to attach
your husband's salary.


25
00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:43.367
You just can't let them take Harry's
salary. He'd never forgive me.


26
00:02:43.543 --> 00:02:47.104
Besides, Mary, employers,
they don't like that sort of thing.


27
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.009
That's why l called you.

28
00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:53.619
Now, Mr. Barnes, l shall delay issuing
a warrant in this case for 30 days.


29
00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:56.755
ln the meantime, this court
will guarantee full payment.


30
00:02:56.923 --> 00:02:58.823
That suits me fine, judge.

31
00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:01.983
We don't like this sort of thing,
but it's business.


32
00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.459
-l know. l know.
-Good day, judge.


33
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.929
-Good day, Mr. Barnes.
-Good day, Mrs. Tompkins.


34
00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:11.466
Even with 30 days more,
l don't see how--


35
00:03:11.637 --> 00:03:14.868
Your husband's always bragging around
at lodge meeting...


36
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.532
...what a miracle of a cook
you've got.


37
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.476
Augusta? She's the best cook ever,
if l know anything about cooking...


38
00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:25.048
-...and l was raised in my mother's kitchen.
-Splendid, splendid.


39
00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:27.380
Now, when you get home...

40
00:03:27.553 --> 00:03:30.954
...tell Harry to give you the wages
he used to pay the cook...


41
00:03:31.124 --> 00:03:36.460
...and you cook from now on. That´ll give
you the money you need for the payments.


42
00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.121
Judge Hardy, do you think it's fair
that Augusta loses her job...


43
00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.133
-...just because l've been foolish?
-Mary, for a long time...


44
00:03:44.303 --> 00:03:48.706
...l've been trying to get up the courage
to tell Mrs. Hardy we should have a cook.


45
00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:52.704
For 30 years she's cooked with
her own hands every meal l've eaten.


46
00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.403
She's gonna be furious.

47
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.445
But l'm putting my foot down.

48
00:03:56.816 --> 00:04:01.776
-Send your cook to my house tomorrow.
-l'll never be able to thank you.


49
00:04:01.954 --> 00:04:07.153
And on your way home, drop in on
Mrs. Hardy and just mention crabapple jam.


50
00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:09.021
She's preserving.

51
00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:14.925
lf Harry likes them, tell him you
know where he can get lots more.


52
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:17.035
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.


53
00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:18.602
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Mary.


54
00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:21.501
-Goodbye, Miss Forrest.
-Goodbye, Mary.


55
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.779
l can't help it, Milly.
l'm glad to give the stuff away.


56
00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:31.815
All the pleasure's gone from putting up
preserves. Guess l'm getting old.


57
00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:35.943
Emily, why don't you get a girl to help
you in the kitchen?


58
00:04:36.122 --> 00:04:38.488
Why, l'd never dare suggest it to James.

59
00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:42.287
He wouldn't touch a mouthful of food
unless l cooked it myself.


60
00:04:44.063 --> 00:04:46.429
l thought it was unusually quiet
around here.


61
00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.659
Andy's usually home by this time.
Wonder where he can be?


62
00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:00.974
There's $ 1 2. l'll sign a promissory note
for the other 8.


63
00:05:01.147 --> 00:05:05.208
Of course, you know, you can't have
the car till you pay the full $20.


64
00:05:05.384 --> 00:05:09.445
-Nobody pays cash nowadays.
-Then bring me that promissory note...


65
00:05:09.622 --> 00:05:11.055
...signed by your father.

66
00:05:11.224 --> 00:05:14.455
Why, l can't make Dad
sign a note, because--


67
00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:17.494
Because he don't know you
figure on buying this car.


68
00:05:17.663 --> 00:05:22.430
Sure he does. That is, he hasn't had
time for me to let him know about it.


69
00:05:22.602 --> 00:05:25.765
-All right. No $8, no automobile.
-Oh, look, please.


70
00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:27.838
l'll get the money
to you somehow.


71
00:05:28.007 --> 00:05:31.738
But in the meantime, can't l come down
and do a little work on it?


72
00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:34.402
Certainly. ln a way, it's your car.

73
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.481
Thanks, Mr. Dugan.
l'll have the money by the 23rd.


74
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.312
Because l need the car on the 24th.

75
00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:43.248
Or l'll be a social outcast.

76
00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:54.692
-Hi, Polly!
-Hi!


77
00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.937
-Hi there!
-Hello. You're two hours late.


78
00:06:10.116 --> 00:06:12.607
l'm sorry, Polly.

79
00:06:12.785 --> 00:06:14.343
l have bad news for you.

80
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.489
l can't go to the country club dance
on Christmas Eve.


81
00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:22.219
You can't go? You've got to.
You don't know the sacrifices l'm making.


82
00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:26.354
lt's impossible. We're going to my
grandmother's tomorrow for the holidays.


83
00:06:26.532 --> 00:06:29.262
A whole year to visit her
and you pick Christmas.


84
00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:32.029
Can't be helped.
And me with a new evening dress.


85
00:06:32.204 --> 00:06:35.037
lt's got a low neck
and practically no sleeves.


86
00:06:35.207 --> 00:06:37.141
-Yeah?
-lt would have been fun...


87
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.210
...going to the dance with you.

88
00:06:39.378 --> 00:06:44.577
At the club, there's a lot of little places
where you can sneak out between dances.


89
00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:50.214
Really, l think we're getting much too old
for that sort of thing, hugging and kissing.


90
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.550
l ain't ever too old
for hugging and kissing.


91
00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:57.287
You didn't act no 90 years old
last night on the porch yourself.


92
00:06:57.463 --> 00:07:01.194
Why, Andrew Hardy!
You kissed me last night by force.


93
00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:03.767
Well, it's good that way too.

94
00:07:03.936 --> 00:07:07.736
Polly, let's get dressed and walk home
the long way through the trees.


95
00:07:18.918 --> 00:07:21.148
Andy.

96
00:07:22.588 --> 00:07:25.455
You'll take some other girl
to the dance, l suppose.


97
00:07:25.624 --> 00:07:28.957
No, l won't. There's no other girl l'd ask.
l'm going stag.


98
00:07:29.128 --> 00:07:31.187
That's sweet of you, Andy.

99
00:07:31.364 --> 00:07:33.161
Sit down, Polly?

100
00:07:34.967 --> 00:07:37.299
Polly, when l say goodbye
to you tomorrow...


101
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.530
-...will you wear your new evening dress?
-ln the daytime?


102
00:07:40.706 --> 00:07:43.231
-That's ridiculous, Andy.
-Oh, please, Polly?


103
00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:45.604
The one l'm not gonna see
at the dance.


104
00:07:45.778 --> 00:07:48.110
With the low neck
and practically no sleeves.


105
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.872
l certainly will not.

106
00:07:50.049 --> 00:07:52.415
lt might get mussed.

107
00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:55.145
You mean l'm gonna get
to kiss you tomorrow?


108
00:07:55.321 --> 00:07:57.619
Well, l will be gone for three weeks.

109
00:07:58.324 --> 00:08:01.225
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
But just supposing, Polly.


110
00:08:01.394 --> 00:08:03.419
Suppose that l'm about to leave and...

111
00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:06.326
...l'm about to kiss you,
one of the girls walk in.


112
00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:09.093
And why do we
have to be supposing that?

113
00:08:09.435 --> 00:08:12.871
Well, what l mean is,
suppose l kiss you now.


114
00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:15.472
We won't have to worry
about anyone walking in.


115
00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:18.542
l thought so.
All your fine talk about...


116
00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:21.202
...taking the long walk home
because of scenery.


117
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.905
You're gonna be gone
and l'm gonna be all alone.


118
00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.449
Doesn't a man resist temptation better...

119
00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:29.087
...if his own girl kisses him goodbye?

120
00:08:29.555 --> 00:08:31.750
Why do you want me to wear
my new dress?


121
00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:35.860
l'll bring a camera, take your picture
and keep it with me at the dance.


122
00:08:36.028 --> 00:08:38.223
Oh, you're a darling.

123
00:08:39.198 --> 00:08:42.531
Tomorrow, Andy.
Don't forget your camera.


124
00:08:58.551 --> 00:09:01.884
-Hello, Andy.
-Oh, hello, Dad.


125
00:09:02.721 --> 00:09:05.053
Just thinking.
A wonderful age we live in.


126
00:09:05.424 --> 00:09:08.416
They didn't have airplanes
when you were a boy, did they?


127
00:09:08.594 --> 00:09:12.052
No, l was quite grown
when men began to fly.


128
00:09:12.231 --> 00:09:14.529
They didn't even have
automobiles, did they?


129
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.361
No.

130
00:09:16.702 --> 00:09:19.068
When you were young,
everybody rode horses.


131
00:09:19.238 --> 00:09:20.899
That's so.

132
00:09:21.073 --> 00:09:24.338
-Did you have your own horse?
-Yes, indeed, l did.


133
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.606
That's fine.
Now, today, everybody rides in automobiles.


134
00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:33.016
No. No, not everybody.

135
00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:35.710
Maybe not everybody.
Maybe not children.


136
00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:38.015
But look, Dad,
l'm not a child anymore.


137
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.021
A fella's just gotta have a car.

138
00:09:40.192 --> 00:09:41.921
-Does he?
-Yes, sir.


139
00:09:42.094 --> 00:09:46.053
l casually discussed the used car business
with Mr. Peter Dugan, and he--


140
00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:49.065
He agrees that every
young man should have a car.


141
00:09:49.235 --> 00:09:52.329
Yes, sir. There's a peach of
a job down there for 20 bucks.


142
00:09:52.505 --> 00:09:55.406
-''Dollars.''
-Dollars. l thought if you might help--


143
00:09:55.574 --> 00:09:58.668
Now, Andy, we've been
over this before.


144
00:09:58.844 --> 00:10:01.711
On occasion, in emergencies,
you've driven the sedan.


145
00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:05.442
You drive very well, though
goodness knows where you learned.


146
00:10:05.618 --> 00:10:08.985
When you're 1 6 years old,
l'll allow you to take the car out.


147
00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:11.086
One night a week.

148
00:10:11.257 --> 00:10:14.749
That way l'll have some control
over the situation.


149
00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:16.895
Gee, Dad, other fellas have cars.

150
00:10:17.062 --> 00:10:19.587
Don't l have as much
sense as the other kids?


151
00:10:19.765 --> 00:10:23.030
l think you've got a lot more.
But l've got to decide this.


152
00:10:23.202 --> 00:10:26.729
When you can pay cash for a car
out of your own money...


153
00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:31.108
-...that's something else.
-Do you believe in the partial payment plan?


154
00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:35.680
No, no. Not unless you have
an assured income of your own.


155
00:10:35.848 --> 00:10:38.874
-Come on home. Dinner's ready.
-l'm gonna buy some film.


156
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:43.044
Polly wants me to take her picture.
You know how girls are.


157
00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:50.251
''Emily, times have changed.

158
00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:55.265
Today, no woman should be
tied to her kitchen....''


159
00:11:06.412 --> 00:11:10.109
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where number 27 is, please?


160
00:11:10.282 --> 00:11:12.773
-Right next door.
-ls it the Draper house?


161
00:11:12.952 --> 00:11:15.420
Right you are, young lady.

162
00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:19.752
-l don't know if anyone's home.
-They'll be home. They're expecting me.


163
00:11:20.492 --> 00:11:22.653
Mr. and Mrs. Draper
are my grandparents.


164
00:11:22.828 --> 00:11:28.061
Well, well, well.
You're Betsy Booth, Martha Draper's baby.


165
00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:30.064
l've come for Christmas.

166
00:11:30.235 --> 00:11:33.727
Mother's doing
a musical comedy in Chicago.


167
00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:36.340
l'm gonna be on the stage too
when l grow up.


168
00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:37.770
l'm studying for it.

169
00:11:37.943 --> 00:11:40.434
l hope you're a bigger success
than your mother.


170
00:11:40.613 --> 00:11:42.877
So we're gonna be neighbors, eh?

171
00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:46.245
l'm Judge Hardy.

172
00:11:47.086 --> 00:11:49.020
ls Andy Hardy your son?

173
00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:52.248
l have heard something to that effect.

174
00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:54.856
Grandma always writes about him.

175
00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:58.861
Oh, he's so polite,
and he always runs her errands for her.


176
00:11:59.031 --> 00:12:02.660
She says he's the nicest boy
in the neighborhood.


177
00:12:02.835 --> 00:12:05.429
Christmas with Andy Hardy next door!

178
00:12:06.772 --> 00:12:09.798
-l hope you won't be disappointed.
-Oh, l won't.


179
00:12:11.443 --> 00:12:15.379
-Well, goodbye, Judge Hardy. For now.
-Goodbye.


180
00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:18.482
Don't forget, we're neighbors.

181
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:48.270
Here, here, here.
What's all the--?


182
00:12:48.447 --> 00:12:49.709
Oh, Dad.

183
00:12:50.983 --> 00:12:54.475
lt can't be that bad, Marian.
Nothing's that bad.


184
00:12:54.653 --> 00:12:56.484
l'm just so mad, l--

185
00:12:56.655 --> 00:12:58.987
Weren't you having
dinner with Wayne?


186
00:12:59.158 --> 00:13:02.184
Dinner? l never want to see him again.

187
00:13:07.599 --> 00:13:10.067
Let's us go in here, huh?

188
00:13:10.836 --> 00:13:12.770
Now, tell me.

189
00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:15.607
What's the matter?

190
00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:20.142
Dad, l'm through with Wayne.

191
00:13:20.312 --> 00:13:23.839
l never want to see him again
as long as l live. Never.


192
00:13:24.016 --> 00:13:27.213
You mean never until
he calls to apologize.


193
00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:28.683
No, Dad. Never.

194
00:13:28.854 --> 00:13:30.879
Dad, he's--

195
00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:35.356
Wayne went out with another girl.
That horrible Maxine Fort.


196
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:40.963
Well, honey.
Half a woman's love is faith.


197
00:13:42.034 --> 00:13:45.094
l'm through with Wayne.
l'm through with all men.


198
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.262
l'm never going to marry
as long as l live. Never.


199
00:13:50.075 --> 00:13:53.442
Well, that's rather a large order, honey.

200
00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:56.780
Maybe l'll do social service work.

201
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:59.850
That's it.
l'll be a settlement worker.


202
00:14:00.652 --> 00:14:03.018
And very commendable too.

203
00:14:03.188 --> 00:14:08.091
But you want to remember, honey,
there's no new sorrow in the world...


204
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.697
...nor a trouble that a lot
of other people couldn't match.


205
00:14:27.713 --> 00:14:29.442
''Emily.

206
00:14:29.615 --> 00:14:33.676
Ever since you were a young bride,
cooking in your first kitchen--''


207
00:14:38.257 --> 00:14:42.216
-Hello, Mother.
-Hello, dear. l didn't hear you come in.


208
00:14:42.394 --> 00:14:44.919
Mother, l want to talk to you.

209
00:14:45.097 --> 00:14:47.122
James, you're in trouble.

210
00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:50.393
Can't l just talk to you
without it being anything special?


211
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:52.696
Well, what is it?

212
00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:57.467
Mother, the day of the pioneer and
the covered wagon is unfortunately over.


213
00:14:57.643 --> 00:14:59.975
You're not going camping at your age.

214
00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:04.946
No, no, no. Of course not.
l mean, times have changed.


215
00:15:05.117 --> 00:15:07.176
Once we did all our own work.

216
00:15:07.352 --> 00:15:09.843
Once we used horses,
now we have cars.


217
00:15:10.022 --> 00:15:13.958
-lf you've bought another automobile--
-No, no. Certainly not.


218
00:15:14.126 --> 00:15:17.653
l mean, horses were all right in their way,
but cars are better.


219
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.627
Same with housework.

220
00:15:19.798 --> 00:15:22.426
Now we have different stoves--

221
00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:26.868
-lt nearly burned.
-But--


222
00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:30.873
lt's all right, dear. l'm listening.
You were talking about horses.


223
00:15:31.043 --> 00:15:33.807
-l wasn't talking about horses.
-You just said that--


224
00:15:33.979 --> 00:15:36.311
l'm talking about cooks!

225
00:15:38.717 --> 00:15:40.651
-l'll go.
-No, let Milly answer it.


226
00:15:40.819 --> 00:15:43.686
She's probably getting fixed up
for dinner. l'll go.


227
00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:53.654
Good evening.
Telegram for you, Mrs. Hardy.


228
00:15:53.832 --> 00:15:55.197
-For me?
-Yes, ma'am.


229
00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:57.995
-Will you please sign here?
-Oh, dear.


230
00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.899
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

231
00:16:00.472 --> 00:16:02.906
l'll sign for it, sonny.

232
00:16:05.377 --> 00:16:07.174
There you are, boy.

233
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.008
Here you are.

234
00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:16.916
-What are you afraid of?
-But a telegram, James.


235
00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:21.389
When we were young telegrams
were new, expensive and exciting.


236
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.429
-Today they're as ordinary as postal cards.
-l don't know, James.


237
00:16:26.598 --> 00:16:29.158
Mother, you're the same
sweet girl l married.


238
00:16:29.334 --> 00:16:32.201
You haven't changed a bit.
But times have.


239
00:16:32.371 --> 00:16:35.738
Telegram's here to stay.
You may as well get used to it.


240
00:16:36.174 --> 00:16:38.165
Oh, dear.

241
00:16:41.613 --> 00:16:43.638
What is it?

242
00:16:46.218 --> 00:16:48.083
Mother had a stroke this morning.

243
00:16:48.253 --> 00:16:50.687
She's still in a coma.

244
00:16:51.323 --> 00:16:56.283
-James, l'll have to go to her.
-Now, Mother, you just relax.


245
00:16:56.495 --> 00:16:59.123
l know it's a shock, but....

246
00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:04.125
Now, now, now, Mother.
Here. You just sit down a minute.


247
00:17:04.303 --> 00:17:07.033
Can't be as bad as you think.

248
00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:09.337
Never is.

249
00:17:14.846 --> 00:17:17.781
That's right, have a good cry.
Make you feel better.


250
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.475
Then you must go right upstairs and rest.

251
00:17:20.652 --> 00:17:22.643
But Milly, our mother....

252
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:25.619
James, l have to go to her.
l'm the oldest, you know.


253
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:27.520
There's a train out tonight.

254
00:17:27.693 --> 00:17:31.823
-Andy will get you a timetable.
-l can't leave you.


255
00:17:31.997 --> 00:17:35.125
l'm a big boy.
l can take care of myself.


256
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.666
-Milly will go with you.
-Thanks, James.


257
00:17:37.836 --> 00:17:42.102
-She'll want to be there.
-l'll put some of our things together, Emily.


258
00:17:42.607 --> 00:17:45.599
James, l can't leave you
and the children alone.


259
00:17:45.777 --> 00:17:48.678
Who will take care
of the house and fix your meals?


260
00:17:48.847 --> 00:17:53.113
Well, Emily, Providence
sometimes moves in a strange way.


261
00:17:53.285 --> 00:17:56.311
l hired a cook this afternoon.

262
00:17:56.488 --> 00:18:00.356
Oh, James, l've wanted
to ask for one for the past five years.


263
00:18:00.525 --> 00:18:02.186
Yes, so did l.

264
00:18:02.361 --> 00:18:05.159
l was afraid you'd think
l didn't like your cooking.


265
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.924
Best cook in the whole world.

266
00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:11.465
Aunt Milly just told us, Mother.
What can l do to help?


267
00:18:11.636 --> 00:18:16.801
Here's your chance. You can start your
settlement work right here in the family.


268
00:18:16.975 --> 00:18:19.239
We're used to having
a woman look after us.


269
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:22.039
Don't worry,
Grandma Forrest will be all right.


270
00:18:22.214 --> 00:18:24.114
And l'll take such good care of Dad.

271
00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:27.385
As for Andy,
if he once steps out of line, l'll--


272
00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:29.750
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.

273
00:18:29.921 --> 00:18:32.446
Social service isn't dictatorship.

274
00:18:32.624 --> 00:18:34.057
l hear what you're saying.

275
00:18:34.226 --> 00:18:36.751
You won't ride any high horse
while Mom is away.


276
00:18:36.928 --> 00:18:38.691
Now, children, children.

277
00:18:38.864 --> 00:18:41.594
-l'm sorry, Mom.
-l'm sorry too, Mother.


278
00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:44.998
l promise to treat Andrew
with the consideration that you do.


279
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.832
l don't like the smell of that.
l'll let it pass.


280
00:18:48.306 --> 00:18:50.774
Mom, l won't be any
trouble to Marian or Dad.


281
00:18:50.942 --> 00:18:53.536
l'll keep my room clean.
l'll wash before meals.


282
00:18:53.712 --> 00:18:56.579
l won't be any trouble
to anyone in the world.


283
00:18:56.882 --> 00:18:59.350
The age of miracle has not passed.

284
00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:01.779
-Find a timetable upstairs.
-l'll get it!


285
00:19:01.953 --> 00:19:04.285
Oh, no, you won't!
Dad told me to get it.


286
00:19:04.456 --> 00:19:08.517
Everything's under control, Mom.
lnstant service. Timetable as good as here.


287
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:10.528
Andy!

288
00:19:11.763 --> 00:19:14.527
That's all right.
Everything's under control.


289
00:19:14.733 --> 00:19:16.598
Everything's under control.

290
00:19:29.714 --> 00:19:32.308
Hey, Marian.
Ain't grub ready yet?


291
00:19:32.484 --> 00:19:34.543
You'd let a guy starve to death.

292
00:19:34.719 --> 00:19:37.051
lf you thought to help
while Mother's away...


293
00:19:37.222 --> 00:19:39.622
...you'd be up at 7:30
this morning, as l was.


294
00:19:39.791 --> 00:19:41.884
Sorry, l'm starving.
Ain't grub ready?


295
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.620
-''lsn't.'' And if you mean breakfast--
-Excuse me.


296
00:19:44.796 --> 00:19:48.493
Would you inform me whether l can
partake in my morning nourishment?


297
00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:52.068
-Come in and find out.
-Such talk!


298
00:19:52.337 --> 00:19:54.134
Good morning, Dad.

299
00:19:54.306 --> 00:19:55.967
Good morning, son.
Sleep well?


300
00:19:56.141 --> 00:19:57.870
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

301
00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:06.277
-ls it that bad, Dad?
-No, no, no. Not at all.


302
00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:08.385
That's excellent coffee.

303
00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:11.249
-Just scalding hot.
-Oh, l'm glad.


304
00:20:11.423 --> 00:20:14.586
l know how fussy you are
about your coffee.


305
00:20:15.427 --> 00:20:18.988
lf she made good coffee,
she must have got it out of a cookbook.


306
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:25.827
She calls that coffee?
Tastes like she put mucilage in it.


307
00:20:26.004 --> 00:20:29.235
-lt's the worst l've ever tasted!
-Take it easy, Andy.


308
00:20:29.407 --> 00:20:32.774
She did the best she could.
We don't want to hurt her feelings.


309
00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:35.936
Leave it to me, Dad.

310
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.048
Marian, this is the best coffee
l've ever tasted.


311
00:20:45.223 --> 00:20:47.157
Honestly, Andy?
That's sweet of you.


312
00:20:47.325 --> 00:20:50.055
-l'll get another cup.
-Never mind. Don't bother.


313
00:20:50.228 --> 00:20:54.756
-Oh, it's no bother.
-One cup is sufficient for a growing boy.


314
00:20:54.933 --> 00:20:56.423
All right.

315
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.097
You saved my life. lf there's anything
l can ever do, say the word.


316
00:21:02.274 --> 00:21:04.640
Thank you, Andrew.
Thank you.


317
00:21:04.809 --> 00:21:06.936
There is something you could do for me.

318
00:21:07.112 --> 00:21:12.243
-Just name it. A favor's a favor.
-The car's about due for a washing.


319
00:21:12.984 --> 00:21:17.011
Yes, sir.
That just about makes us even, all right.


320
00:21:19.858 --> 00:21:23.521
Mother left a note for you
to take some preserves over to the Drapers.


321
00:21:23.695 --> 00:21:27.290
-Don't forget.
-Oh, yes. They have a visitor.


322
00:21:27.465 --> 00:21:29.456
A new playmate for you.

323
00:21:29.634 --> 00:21:34.367
Playmate? What do you think l do with my
spare time, dress dolls or something?


324
00:21:34.573 --> 00:21:36.973
Excuse me, Andrew.
A companion.


325
00:21:37.542 --> 00:21:40.773
-Their granddaughter from New York.
-A new girl?


326
00:21:40.946 --> 00:21:42.971
-Yes.
-How old is she?


327
00:21:43.148 --> 00:21:46.049
Oh, l think about
1 2 or 1 3.

328
00:21:46.218 --> 00:21:47.742
Just a child.

329
00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:50.410
l realized something.
l'm older than my years.


330
00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:53.285
-Must have been Washington that done it.
-''Did'' it.


331
00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:55.016
-Did it.
-Nevertheless...


332
00:21:55.193 --> 00:21:58.993
...you'll have to humiliate yourself
and deliver the preserves.


333
00:21:59.731 --> 00:22:02.427
l understand the little girl
next door sings.


334
00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:04.398
Twelve years old and sings?

335
00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:13.443
l'll go, Grandma.

336
00:22:22.153 --> 00:22:23.677
How do you do?

337
00:22:23.855 --> 00:22:25.686
Good morning.

338
00:22:25.857 --> 00:22:27.654
l'm Betsy Booth.

339
00:22:27.826 --> 00:22:29.555
Won't you come in?

340
00:22:29.728 --> 00:22:32.822
My mother just sent these
over to your grandmother.


341
00:22:34.399 --> 00:22:38.165
-You're Andy Hardy, aren't you?
-l live right next door.


342
00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:40.470
l....

343
00:22:40.639 --> 00:22:43.506
-l sing, you know.
-l know. l heard you.


344
00:22:43.675 --> 00:22:46.337
Oh, that wasn't singing.
That was only practicing.


345
00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:49.143
Well, go and practice.
Don't let me bother--


346
00:22:49.314 --> 00:22:52.010
Oh, it's no bother. l love to....

347
00:22:52.183 --> 00:22:55.710
l mean, l'd love to sing for you.

348
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.388
Some other time.
You just keep on practicing.


349
00:22:58.556 --> 00:23:01.081
Music isn't the most important
thing to me.


350
00:23:01.259 --> 00:23:05.889
-l play tennis. And l swim.
-Swell. Well, look, l gotta be going.


351
00:23:06.064 --> 00:23:08.828
l gotta do something for my dad.
Wash the car.


352
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.561
l mean, tune it up.
Wash the carburetor and the spark plugs.


353
00:23:12.737 --> 00:23:14.671
l might even look at the motor.

354
00:23:15.607 --> 00:23:19.509
l bet after you work on it
it'll pass every car on the road.


355
00:23:20.312 --> 00:23:24.373
Well, l wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Well, l gotta be running.


356
00:23:24.849 --> 00:23:27.818
Well, maybe--
Could l help you?


357
00:23:27.986 --> 00:23:30.750
No. lt's a special job.
My father won't even do it.


358
00:23:30.922 --> 00:23:34.085
l'll see you later.
Goodbye.


359
00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:44.661
l'll never be able to get a man,
much less hold him.


360
00:23:44.836 --> 00:23:46.963
No glamour.

361
00:23:48.006 --> 00:23:49.940
No glamour at all.

362
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.370
Betsy, who was that?

363
00:23:54.546 --> 00:23:57.845
Some of Mrs. Hardy's
preserves for you, Granny.


364
00:23:59.951 --> 00:24:01.976
No glamour.

365
00:24:02.153 --> 00:24:04.417
That's my trouble.

366
00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.782
-Hi, Andy.
-Oh, hi, Beezy.


367
00:24:10.061 --> 00:24:11.619
Say, l've gotta talk to you.

368
00:24:11.796 --> 00:24:14.356
Very private and confidential.

369
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.667
Just when l was
getting ready to go to work.


370
00:24:18.837 --> 00:24:21.169
Oh, well, come on.

371
00:24:37.055 --> 00:24:38.750
-Good morning.
-Good morning.


372
00:24:38.923 --> 00:24:42.791
-l'm Augusta, the new cook.
-Oh, of course. Come right in.


373
00:24:46.297 --> 00:24:48.561
-Hello there.
-Hello.


374
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:51.301
Say, did Andy go into the house?

375
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.170
l saw him sneaking
down the street with Beezy.


376
00:24:54.339 --> 00:24:57.638
And if the car isn't washed,
he's going to catch it.


377
00:25:10.722 --> 00:25:13.589
We're far enough away.
They couldn't hear us holler.


378
00:25:13.758 --> 00:25:15.817
-What's on your mind?
-Andy...


379
00:25:15.994 --> 00:25:18.485
-...l'm in love.
-Who is it this time?


380
00:25:18.663 --> 00:25:20.528
-Cynthia Potter.
-That dizzy dame?


381
00:25:20.698 --> 00:25:23.997
-Say, listen--
-There's no accounting for taste. Go on.


382
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:27.036
My folks are taking me away on a trip.
Three weeks!


383
00:25:27.205 --> 00:25:29.366
l'm in the same boat.
Polly left today.


384
00:25:29.641 --> 00:25:34.340
Andy, l don't suppose, as sort of a favor,
you'd date her up?


385
00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:36.104
Keep the other guys away.

386
00:25:36.281 --> 00:25:38.613
Me? Go after your girl?

387
00:25:38.783 --> 00:25:41.081
Sure. When l get back,
you drop her cold.


388
00:25:41.252 --> 00:25:44.585
-Then she's still my girl.
-That's a terrible trick to play.


389
00:25:44.823 --> 00:25:48.657
-Andy, you've got to help me.
-No, no, no, no.


390
00:25:48.827 --> 00:25:51.261
Look, if you do it,
l'll pay you for it.


391
00:25:53.298 --> 00:25:57.758
Well, l suppose if you paid me
it'd make it more respectable.


392
00:25:57.936 --> 00:26:00.268
-Just a straight business proposition.
-Sure.


393
00:26:00.438 --> 00:26:03.532
You keep other guys
from dating Cynthia until l get back...


394
00:26:03.708 --> 00:26:07.701
-...and l'll pay you four bits a week.
-Four bits a week?


395
00:26:07.879 --> 00:26:11.645
Expose myself to a redheaded
vampire for four bits a week?


396
00:26:11.816 --> 00:26:14.284
-Listen, l'll make it six bits.
-Look at you.


397
00:26:14.452 --> 00:26:17.216
You're in love,
and all she means to you is six bits?


398
00:26:17.388 --> 00:26:19.379
Beezy, you don't know what love is.

399
00:26:19.557 --> 00:26:22.924
Look, l'll go one dollar.
That's as far as l'll go.


400
00:26:23.094 --> 00:26:25.028
lt's a pleasure taking out Cynthia.

401
00:26:25.196 --> 00:26:27.426
No, Beezy.
A dollar's not enough.


402
00:26:27.599 --> 00:26:29.123
Well, how much do you want?

403
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.599
l need--
l want 8 bucks and expenses.


404
00:26:33.404 --> 00:26:36.635
-Expenses?
-Think l want to ruin her reputation...


405
00:26:36.808 --> 00:26:39.072
...having everybody say l'm a cheapskate?

406
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.937
You win. 8 bucks for the job
and 50 cents a week for expenses.


407
00:26:43.114 --> 00:26:45.947
-Give me the 8 bucks.
-l haven't got it right now.


408
00:26:46.117 --> 00:26:49.211
-Then the deal's off.
-When Mom gives me Christmas money...


409
00:26:49.387 --> 00:26:51.548
-...l'll mail you the 8 bucks.
-When?


410
00:26:51.723 --> 00:26:54.419
She'll give it to me
a week before Christmas.


411
00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:57.026
Word of honor,
l'll have it before the 23rd.


412
00:26:57.195 --> 00:26:59.186
-Word of honor.
-lt's a deal.


413
00:26:59.364 --> 00:27:01.696
Leave it to me.
l've got a system with women.


414
00:27:01.866 --> 00:27:05.597
After l give Cynthia the air,
she'll be tickled even with you, Beezy.


415
00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.137
Hey, wait a minute.
How do l know you'll go through with it?


416
00:27:09.374 --> 00:27:12.741
l know. Ask Cynthia to
the Christmas Eve dance now.


417
00:27:12.911 --> 00:27:16.847
And if l know Cynthia,
you'll have to go through with it.


418
00:27:17.015 --> 00:27:19.916
Say, that's not a bad idea.

419
00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:24.682
After all, a redhead's a redhead.

420
00:27:25.657 --> 00:27:28.421
l get into my tuxedo
for a cotillion in Washington--


421
00:27:28.593 --> 00:27:29.855
Washington?

422
00:27:30.028 --> 00:27:32.826
This little French girl
sees l'm a very good dancer.


423
00:27:32.997 --> 00:27:35.966
She says, ''<i>Pardonnez-moi</i>.''
That's French for ''Excuse me.''


424
00:27:36.134 --> 00:27:39.297
-She asked me to teach her the Big Apple.
-That's marvelous.


425
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.665
-Do you really like to dance?
-l sure do.


426
00:27:41.839 --> 00:27:45.866
But that's with the right partner.
l'll bet you could dance swell.


427
00:27:46.044 --> 00:27:48.274
Some girls like a fella
to hold them tight.


428
00:27:48.446 --> 00:27:51.643
l bet you're different.
Fella would be too afraid.


429
00:27:51.816 --> 00:27:54.546
Well, l am really delicate, but....

430
00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:57.552
Well, it depends on who my partner is.

431
00:27:57.722 --> 00:28:01.818
Well, would you like me if l was
your partner at the Christmas dance?


432
00:28:01.993 --> 00:28:03.551
Why, Andrew!

433
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.955
You'll really take me
to the Christmas Eve dance?


434
00:28:08.132 --> 00:28:11.898
l'd better go in.
Mother will wonder why l'm out so long.


435
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.766
Goodbye, Andrew, darling.
See you tomorrow.


436
00:28:14.939 --> 00:28:16.770
Goodbye.

437
00:28:26.484 --> 00:28:29.317
Say, she's my girl.
Don't forget that.


438
00:28:29.487 --> 00:28:31.216
You hired me, didn't you?

439
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:34.290
-You didn't have to kiss her.
-l didn't. She kissed me.


440
00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:37.360
That's it. You start your system
and she kisses you.


441
00:28:37.528 --> 00:28:41.692
lt was a kiss of gratitude,
like a dog licking your hand.


442
00:28:41.866 --> 00:28:43.925
Besides, l've gotta do
my wooing my way.


443
00:28:44.102 --> 00:28:46.366
She's just 8 bucks and expenses to me.

444
00:28:46.537 --> 00:28:50.337
You might at least wipe my girl's
lipstick off your face.


445
00:28:58.583 --> 00:29:00.016
Hello.

446
00:29:00.918 --> 00:29:04.752
Say, did you notice anything around here
about washing this car?


447
00:29:04.922 --> 00:29:06.947
Yes, l had Mother's chauffeur do it.

448
00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:09.389
-Mother's what?
-Mother's chauffeur.


449
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.961
-l heard your sister say you'd catch it.
-You've got a chauffeur?


450
00:29:13.131 --> 00:29:15.827
Mother has.
The one that drives the town car.


451
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.367
-Town car? Here?
-Sure. lt brought me.


452
00:29:19.537 --> 00:29:22.973
-How do you think l got here?
-How do l think she got here?


453
00:29:23.141 --> 00:29:25.632
What kind of a car?
How many cylinders?


454
00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.677
-Two hundred.
-Two hundred?


455
00:29:28.846 --> 00:29:31.940
-Listen, no car has 200 cylinders.
-Hasn't it?


456
00:29:32.116 --> 00:29:33.583
No.

457
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:37.881
Oh, then it's 200 horsepower
and only 1 2 cylinders.


458
00:29:38.056 --> 00:29:41.787
Only 1 2 cylinders and 200 horsepower.

459
00:29:42.126 --> 00:29:46.028
Children that don't know what's what
trusted with town cars.


460
00:29:47.298 --> 00:29:50.199
Betsy? Your name is Betsy, isn't it?

461
00:29:50.368 --> 00:29:52.962
Betsy, l'd like to repay the favor.

462
00:29:53.137 --> 00:29:56.698
l'd like to take you to the drugstore
and buy you an ice cream soda.


463
00:29:56.874 --> 00:29:58.535
Will you, Andy?

464
00:29:59.143 --> 00:30:03.876
But it's kind of far, and it's liable to snow
before we get there and dad's using our car.


465
00:30:04.048 --> 00:30:07.779
Mother's chauffeur can drive us down
before he starts for Chicago.


466
00:30:07.952 --> 00:30:11.854
That's right. l never thought of that.
Let's go!


467
00:30:26.037 --> 00:30:27.664
Yes, sir. Some boat, all right.

468
00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:31.866
The radiator cap alone would make you
feel like you was a millionaire.


469
00:30:35.379 --> 00:30:36.846
Hello, folks.
What'll it be?


470
00:30:37.014 --> 00:30:39.448
Chocolate soda with
vanilla ice cream, please.


471
00:30:39.617 --> 00:30:41.244
-Make it two, buddy.
-You bet.


472
00:30:41.419 --> 00:30:44.183
Something about ice cream sodas
makes a fella feel...


473
00:30:44.355 --> 00:30:48.348
...as though he's wasting time with
meat and vegetables. Ain't it the truth?


474
00:30:48.526 --> 00:30:52.053
-Hello, Cynthia.
-How do you do, Mr. Hardy?


475
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.064
Hey, Cynthia, wait a minute.

476
00:30:55.233 --> 00:30:57.224
-Cynthia!
-Pardon me, Mr. Hardy.


477
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:01.531
l'm not in the habit of being practically
knocked down by casual acquaintances.


478
00:31:01.706 --> 00:31:04.971
Casual acquaintances!
What are you mad about?


479
00:31:05.143 --> 00:31:07.634
There are plenty of boys
l could go around with.


480
00:31:07.812 --> 00:31:10.076
No, you can't go around
with anybody but me.


481
00:31:10.248 --> 00:31:12.307
l don't even have to go
to the dance with you.


482
00:31:12.483 --> 00:31:14.075
Oh, yes, you do.
You promised.


483
00:31:14.252 --> 00:31:16.049
l wasn't crazy about Beezy...

484
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.155
...but at least he didn't
go out with other girls.


485
00:31:19.323 --> 00:31:22.349
Oh, her? Oh, she's just a little kid
visiting next door.


486
00:31:22.527 --> 00:31:26.327
Dad told me to be nice to her.
lt won't happen again.


487
00:31:26.497 --> 00:31:29.625
l'll see you every day, every minute.
l'll monopolize you.


488
00:31:29.801 --> 00:31:32.497
-This afternoon?
-What´ll we do?


489
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.434
Beezy could always think
of something for us to do.


490
00:31:35.606 --> 00:31:38.074
We could go and watch
basketball practice.


491
00:31:38.242 --> 00:31:40.369
l don't like basketball.

492
00:31:41.145 --> 00:31:45.138
-l used to like to roller skate.
-l don't like to roller skate.


493
00:31:45.917 --> 00:31:48.681
l don't suppose you'd like to
play a set of tennis.


494
00:31:48.853 --> 00:31:52.345
Why, l'd love to.
Oh, l have the loveliest new sports outfit.


495
00:31:52.523 --> 00:31:55.617
Well, you be at my house at 2:00.

496
00:32:01.999 --> 00:32:05.264
-Excuse me for running away, Betsy.
-lt's all right.


497
00:32:05.603 --> 00:32:08.003
You see, l can't afford
to fight with Cynthia.


498
00:32:08.172 --> 00:32:09.639
-ls she your girl?
-No.


499
00:32:09.807 --> 00:32:12.173
l gotta be nice
to her till after Christmas.

500
00:32:12.343 --> 00:32:14.868
You expecting her to give you
a special present?


501
00:32:15.046 --> 00:32:16.604
No.

502
00:32:16.848 --> 00:32:19.908
Look, this is a secret:
l bought a car.


503
00:32:20.084 --> 00:32:23.815
l paid 1 2 bucks down on it and
promised to pay 8 more by the 23rd.


504
00:32:23.988 --> 00:32:25.819
That's why l gotta be nice to her.

505
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.823
-l don't get it.
-Cynthia's Beezy Anderson's girl.


506
00:32:28.993 --> 00:32:33.430
He's away, and he promised to pay me
to keep the other fellas away from her.


507
00:32:34.432 --> 00:32:37.595
She's just an installment
on a car to me.

508
00:32:38.803 --> 00:32:42.034
Polly Benedict's my real girl,
but she's away too.


509
00:32:44.575 --> 00:32:47.066
Sometimes l wonder if it's all worthwhile.

510
00:32:56.354 --> 00:32:57.844
Twenty bucks!

511
00:32:58.222 --> 00:33:00.213
Mother said in case l needed extras...

512
00:33:00.391 --> 00:33:03.724
...so if you wouldn't mind, Andy,
l'd like to pay for the sodas.


513
00:33:03.895 --> 00:33:06.762
-No. l asked you.
-Please?


514
00:33:06.931 --> 00:33:10.162
Why, l don't do things that way.

515
00:33:11.836 --> 00:33:13.428
Andy...

516
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:17.429
...you need that 8 bucks
pretty badly, don't you?


517
00:33:17.608 --> 00:33:19.371
You're darn tooting l do.

518
00:33:21.245 --> 00:33:23.770
l'd love to give you the $8, Andy.

519
00:33:23.948 --> 00:33:26.348
No. l couldn't take money from a woman.

520
00:33:26.817 --> 00:33:28.785
Not even if she's just a child?

521
00:33:29.287 --> 00:33:31.312
l couldn't even borrow it from you.

522
00:33:32.323 --> 00:33:35.952
-You wouldn't have to be nice to Cynthia.
-You don't understand.


523
00:33:36.127 --> 00:33:40.086
Polly being away, the girl l take to
the dance has gotta be sensational.


524
00:33:40.932 --> 00:33:43.594
l'll bet Cynthia's got
a sensational evening dress.


525
00:33:43.768 --> 00:33:47.260
No, l can't afford to fight with Cynthia,
not a man in my position.


526
00:33:47.438 --> 00:33:49.167
Then it isn't the $8.

527
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.570
Well, it's both the $8 and Cynthia.

528
00:33:51.742 --> 00:33:54.768
l gotta take Cynthia to the dance
to get $8 for the car...


529
00:33:54.946 --> 00:33:57.938
...and l gotta have a car
to take anybody to the dance.


530
00:33:58.282 --> 00:34:01.718
Well, then you won't really
enjoy taking Cynthia?


531
00:34:02.753 --> 00:34:05.347
Well, even if she dances like a horse...

532
00:34:05.523 --> 00:34:08.390
...it's an awful long ride
home in the dark.


533
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:16.559
Augusta, you must realize we're
accustomed to the best of everything.


534
00:34:16.734 --> 00:34:20.101
l want you to pay particular
attention to the coffee.


535
00:34:22.873 --> 00:34:27.606
You call that coffee? That's mud.
That's what it is, mud.


536
00:34:27.845 --> 00:34:30.746
Augusta, do you realize
you are being insulting?


537
00:34:30.915 --> 00:34:34.749
l quit. Any house that calls
that mud coffee, l don't work in.


538
00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:37.080
-Oh, but, Augusta, l--
-Marian?


539
00:34:37.922 --> 00:34:41.153
Well, well, well,
what seems to be the difficulty?


540
00:34:41.325 --> 00:34:43.452
-She insulted my coffee.
-Mud.


541
00:34:43.627 --> 00:34:47.324
Any house that calls that mud coffee, l quit.
l don't work there.


542
00:34:47.498 --> 00:34:50.524
But, Dad, you said yourself it was excellent.

543
00:34:50.835 --> 00:34:53.770
lt is. lt's fine coffee.

544
00:34:53.938 --> 00:34:56.270
Yes, Augusta, it's fine coffee.

545
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.841
Of course, only amateur coffee.
l know you could do much better.


546
00:35:00.011 --> 00:35:01.273
l'll try, Your Honor.

547
00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:04.039
We'll reserve that ''Your Honor''
for the courtroom.


548
00:35:04.215 --> 00:35:06.115
Okay, judge.

549
00:35:07.051 --> 00:35:10.179
Come along, Marian.
We ought to write to Mother.


550
00:35:12.289 --> 00:35:14.189
Anyhow, it was mud.

551
00:35:14.358 --> 00:35:16.326
That's what it was, mud.

552
00:35:22.833 --> 00:35:26.234
But, Dad, the bathroom was filthy.
The towels were black.


553
00:35:26.404 --> 00:35:28.668
Where he accumulates
such filth and grease--


554
00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:32.331
You can't please her.
She hollers if l wash and hollers if l don't.


555
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.001
He has no more conception
of cleanliness than--


556
00:35:35.413 --> 00:35:37.540
-Than a tomcat?
-Exactly.


557
00:35:37.715 --> 00:35:40.115
You see? She wants me
to lick myself clean.


558
00:35:42.353 --> 00:35:44.878
lf he thinks l'll clean up after him,
he's wrong.


559
00:35:45.056 --> 00:35:48.548
Oh, l'll do that.
lt'll be easy after twins at the Tompkins' .


560
00:35:48.726 --> 00:35:50.489
Thank you, Augusta.

561
00:35:50.661 --> 00:35:52.424
l'll go.

562
00:35:53.831 --> 00:35:56.857
Everybody spoils Andy because
he's the baby in the family.


563
00:35:57.034 --> 00:36:00.561
Baby? Dad, am l gonna have to be
insulted until l'm 80?


564
00:36:00.738 --> 00:36:03.502
lt won't happen again, Marian.

565
00:36:05.376 --> 00:36:07.435
Special delivery.

566
00:36:26.163 --> 00:36:28.131
She all right, Dad?

567
00:36:28.532 --> 00:36:31.262
Mother's well and sends her love.

568
00:36:31.435 --> 00:36:33.995
They don't know about
Grandmother Forrest yet.


569
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:35.832
Pretty serious, l guess.

570
00:36:36.006 --> 00:36:40.773
What do you say, with Grandma Forrest
so sick, we give up our social engagements?


571
00:36:40.945 --> 00:36:45.211
Well, what is it that Grandmother Forrest
always asks you when you visit her?


572
00:36:45.382 --> 00:36:46.906
''Are you having a good time?''

573
00:36:47.384 --> 00:36:50.751
l think that's your answer, Andy,
in Grandmother's own words.


574
00:36:52.123 --> 00:36:53.750
l'll get it.

575
00:36:57.161 --> 00:36:58.822
Hello?

576
00:36:58.996 --> 00:37:00.827
Just a minute.

577
00:37:02.933 --> 00:37:04.594
-lt's for you, Andy.
-Who is it?


578
00:37:04.768 --> 00:37:07.362
The same one. Cynthia.
lt's the fourth time today.


579
00:37:07.538 --> 00:37:11.599
-She ought to move here and save money.
-Oh, smart cracks.


580
00:37:11.809 --> 00:37:13.037
Hello, Cynthia?

581
00:37:14.778 --> 00:37:16.541
Yes, Cynthia.

582
00:37:17.148 --> 00:37:19.582
Well, anything you wanna do.

583
00:37:20.384 --> 00:37:22.614
Why, sure, l'd like to.

584
00:37:24.555 --> 00:37:28.082
Yes, ma'am.
l mean, certainly, Cynthia.


585
00:37:29.793 --> 00:37:32.660
All right, Cynthia.
Goodbye.


586
00:37:38.335 --> 00:37:41.361
Well, l don't think you're
very amusing, Andy.


587
00:37:41.972 --> 00:37:44.406
What else is there to do
at a pool except swim?


588
00:37:44.575 --> 00:37:46.839
lf you can't think of anything
to amuse me--


589
00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:49.878
Okay, okay, watch me.

590
00:38:04.562 --> 00:38:09.124
Andy! Stop it, Andy! Stop!

591
00:38:12.269 --> 00:38:14.760
Really, there's no need
to practically drown me.


592
00:38:14.939 --> 00:38:17.066
l'm sorry. Come on in.
The water's swell.


593
00:38:17.241 --> 00:38:18.902
No, my hair would get wet.

594
00:38:19.076 --> 00:38:20.600
Oh, well, can't you dry it?

595
00:38:20.778 --> 00:38:23.269
Andrew, l haven't ordinary hair
like some girls.


596
00:38:23.447 --> 00:38:27.042
Special hair like mine is a great
responsibility. l never get it wet.


597
00:38:27.218 --> 00:38:30.346
You'll get wet if you swim,
get muscles if you play tennis--


598
00:38:30.521 --> 00:38:33.649
-Other boys would be glad of a chance--
-Don't get mad...


599
00:38:33.824 --> 00:38:38.523
...but you don't need a bathing suit to sit.
Can't you think of something else to do?


600
00:38:38.696 --> 00:38:40.630
Well, we....

601
00:38:41.265 --> 00:38:42.755
We could take a walk.

602
00:38:43.968 --> 00:38:48.234
Say, that's not a bad idea.
l know just the place.


603
00:38:48.405 --> 00:38:51.431
lt's a little longer than
the regular way home, but....


604
00:38:54.878 --> 00:38:57.540
Well, l finally found something
you like to do.


605
00:38:57.715 --> 00:38:59.842
Well, doesn't it interest you?

606
00:39:00.017 --> 00:39:03.384
Well, l'm not exactly doing you any favors.

607
00:39:03.621 --> 00:39:06.021
Would you rather be swimming?

608
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.215
What do you think?

609
00:39:09.393 --> 00:39:12.954
Hey, Andy! Andy, come in a minute,
l wanna talk to you.


610
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:17.328
All right, but l can't make it long.
lf l'm late for dinner, l'll catch it.


611
00:39:21.171 --> 00:39:23.867
-What's up?
-Come here. l got something to show you.


612
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:25.440
What is it?

613
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:27.304
lt's a--

614
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.457
Must have been that
jelly sandwich that l had.


615
00:39:47.364 --> 00:39:48.661
Come on in here.

616
00:39:50.534 --> 00:39:52.695
What's all the mystery?

617
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.395
l got you a present.
l hope you like it.


618
00:39:55.572 --> 00:39:57.972
Well, what do you know?

619
00:40:04.581 --> 00:40:05.843
Do you like it?

620
00:40:06.016 --> 00:40:08.177
Why, it's the best present l ever got.

621
00:40:08.352 --> 00:40:12.220
l'm glad. l guessed you wanted one,
so l ordered it. lt just now got here.


622
00:40:12.723 --> 00:40:15.749
lt'll make my car look like a million.
Gee, thanks, Betsy.


623
00:40:15.926 --> 00:40:18.986
Some girls don't know what to get a guy,
but this is swell.


624
00:40:19.163 --> 00:40:23.293
Why, Cynthia, she'll be crazy about it.
And Polly, she'll go wild.


625
00:40:23.934 --> 00:40:26.061
l'm sure they'll like it.

626
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.200
l'll drop by before the dance
and show you.


627
00:40:29.373 --> 00:40:31.102
That'll be nice.

628
00:40:31.275 --> 00:40:33.869
Dinner's almost ready,
so l better be going along.


629
00:40:34.044 --> 00:40:37.275
-Thanks again. Goodbye.
-Bye.


630
00:40:41.352 --> 00:40:43.718
Aren't you going to practice, Betsy?

631
00:40:43.887 --> 00:40:45.821
Yes, Granny.

632
00:44:56.773 --> 00:45:00.869
l know, but men just don't seem to be
as important as when l was a young girl.


633
00:45:01.044 --> 00:45:03.535
Well, if it isn't the old ladies'
sewing circle.


634
00:45:03.714 --> 00:45:05.238
-Hi, Andy.
-Hello there, Andy.


635
00:45:05.415 --> 00:45:08.282
-Did you enjoy your games?
-Games?


636
00:45:08.986 --> 00:45:12.387
With a bit more practice,
l might be able to make the Potsy team.


637
00:45:12.556 --> 00:45:14.183
-What's that?
-Nothing, nothing.


638
00:45:14.358 --> 00:45:17.759
Oh, all right.
You're going to have secrets, so can l.


639
00:45:17.928 --> 00:45:20.362
There are ways of handling
mysterious children.


640
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.091
Just because you're the only woman here
doesn't make you my mother.


641
00:45:24.267 --> 00:45:27.293
lf you act that way,
l won't give you your telegram.


642
00:45:27.471 --> 00:45:30.133
Telegram! Oh, my dearest sister...

643
00:45:30.307 --> 00:45:33.435
...if l've offended you in any way,
l beg you to forgive me.


644
00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.205
After all, we children, we just--
We just don't understand.


645
00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.787
Gee, thanks, sis. Thanks.

646
00:46:12.449 --> 00:46:14.474
Two girls.

647
00:46:14.685 --> 00:46:17.711
Two girls for the same dance.

648
00:46:34.171 --> 00:46:37.368
Good morning, Dad, Marian.
Any word from Mom?


649
00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:40.339
No news is good news, son.

650
00:46:40.677 --> 00:46:45.580
Well, in case you're at all curious,
l finished my Christmas shopping today.


651
00:46:45.749 --> 00:46:50.448
Me too. And l wanna thank somebody for
that extra money l found on my table.


652
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:55.057
That's all right, honey.
Christmas comes but once a year.


653
00:47:02.232 --> 00:47:04.962
-Well.
-Special delivery for Mr. Andrew Hardy.


654
00:47:05.435 --> 00:47:07.665
l'll sign for it.

655
00:47:08.538 --> 00:47:11.735
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Good morning.


656
00:47:12.876 --> 00:47:15.344
Special delivery for Mr. Andrew Hardy.

657
00:47:15.512 --> 00:47:16.979
Thanks, Dad.

658
00:47:17.147 --> 00:47:20.275
Francis Bacon Anderson.
Why, that's Beezy Anderson.


659
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:23.613
-Want me to read it to you?
-Good old Beezy, real pal.


660
00:47:23.787 --> 00:47:26.017
Right on time, just like the Pony Express.

661
00:47:26.189 --> 00:47:28.817
-Goodbye, children.
-Bye, Dad.


662
00:47:28.992 --> 00:47:32.723
Open it. Let's read about the teddy bear
Beezy's getting for Christmas.


663
00:47:32.896 --> 00:47:35.387
Oh, no hurry.
l know what's inside.


664
00:47:35.966 --> 00:47:37.433
And l know who that is.

665
00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:40.900
''This is Miss Potter speaking.
May l please speak to Andrew?''


666
00:47:41.071 --> 00:47:43.471
Kindergarten society.

667
00:47:48.178 --> 00:47:49.645
Hello?

668
00:47:50.046 --> 00:47:52.344
What's on your mind, Cynthia?

669
00:47:53.016 --> 00:47:57.112
Oh, don't worry about the dance.
l wouldn't miss it for anything in the world.


670
00:47:58.388 --> 00:48:00.754
Oh, you got your new formal dress?

671
00:48:01.258 --> 00:48:03.192
Sensational, huh?

672
00:48:03.894 --> 00:48:06.089
No back in it at all?

673
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:08.825
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

674
00:48:09.432 --> 00:48:11.627
Well, l'll be seeing you soon.

675
00:48:11.802 --> 00:48:14.430
All right, dear.
Bye-bye.


676
00:48:31.254 --> 00:48:33.882
Hello. ls Miss Polly Benedict in, please?

677
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:37.087
Listen, will you tell her
Mr. Andrew Hardy called...


678
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:41.594
...and he's unable to take her to the dance?
He remembered a previous engagement.


679
00:48:42.299 --> 00:48:45.564
Thank you so much. Bye.

680
00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.745
-Hello.
-Hello.


681
00:48:58.915 --> 00:49:03.750
l spent all my money except 60 cents,
and l still got two presents to buy.


682
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.118
Gee, l'd like to help you, Betsy,
but l've got a very important deal to close.


683
00:49:08.658 --> 00:49:11.559
Beezy came through like
the Marines landing.


684
00:49:13.697 --> 00:49:17.360
Then it's all fixed up about your--
Your car?


685
00:49:38.889 --> 00:49:42.689
-Oh, l'm ruined.
-Andy, what's the matter?


686
00:49:42.859 --> 00:49:46.727
-Are you sick?
-Oh, l wish l was sick.


687
00:49:46.897 --> 00:49:49.525
Oh, how l wished l was sick.

688
00:49:50.066 --> 00:49:54.867
Beezy's gone and fallen for another girl.
He said l could have Cynthia.


689
00:49:55.038 --> 00:49:58.201
The whole deal's off.
l'm cooked.


690
00:49:58.375 --> 00:50:01.071
Well, we've gotta do something.

691
00:50:01.244 --> 00:50:03.405
We gotta talk to Mr. Dugan.

692
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.071
Come on.
Come on, Andy.


693
00:50:06.249 --> 00:50:07.773
Come on.

694
00:50:09.019 --> 00:50:10.281
All right.

695
00:50:10.453 --> 00:50:13.945
No 8 bucks, no sports-model
roadster, my friend.


696
00:50:14.124 --> 00:50:15.591
Gee, Mr. Dugan, couldn't l--

697
00:50:15.759 --> 00:50:18.751
You gotta pay for this car
by tomorrow noon or--


698
00:50:18.929 --> 00:50:21.397
You're Judge Hardy's son, aren't you?

699
00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:23.722
Yeah, sort of.

700
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.460
l'll go to court and get
an order to show cause.


701
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:29.163
And you know what that'll mean.

702
00:50:29.606 --> 00:50:32.370
Yeah, l--
l got a rough idea.


703
00:50:32.542 --> 00:50:35.272
Well, there you are.

704
00:50:41.818 --> 00:50:43.410
Andy.

705
00:50:45.522 --> 00:50:48.082
l've only got 60 cents...

706
00:50:48.258 --> 00:50:53.321
...but l've got a fur jacket, practically new.
We could pawn it and pay Mr. Dugan.


707
00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.792
But we just can't let this happen.

708
00:50:56.967 --> 00:51:00.801
Betsy, you're the best friend l ever had,
but l couldn't let you do that.


709
00:51:00.971 --> 00:51:04.338
lt's-
- Well, it's more than a car now.

710
00:51:04.507 --> 00:51:07.271
Yes, but if l did get the money,
no one would know.


711
00:51:07.444 --> 00:51:09.207
l gotta do this myself.

712
00:51:09.379 --> 00:51:11.074
Dad used to recite me a poem.

713
00:51:11.247 --> 00:51:14.910
lt's all about a tangled web you make
when you start deceiving people.


714
00:51:15.085 --> 00:51:16.518
l know what it means now.

715
00:51:16.686 --> 00:51:20.679
When you do something phony
and it turns out good, it's still all wrong.


716
00:51:20.857 --> 00:51:25.260
-Maybe if l explained to your father.
-No, l've gotta do my own explaining.


717
00:51:25.428 --> 00:51:27.988
Of course, l never
told him any real lies.

718
00:51:28.164 --> 00:51:30.826
l just can't seem to be able to.

719
00:51:31.067 --> 00:51:35.527
But, gee, he'll start thinking that sometimes
not actually telling a dozen lies...


720
00:51:35.705 --> 00:51:38.139
...is worse than really telling one.

721
00:51:38.308 --> 00:51:41.539
No, l've gotta tell Dad.

722
00:51:43.713 --> 00:51:46.409
And there's no telling what'll happen.

723
00:52:04.434 --> 00:52:06.231
Did you want to be alone, Dad?

724
00:52:06.403 --> 00:52:09.861
No, not at all, not at all.
Sit down.


725
00:52:16.446 --> 00:52:18.038
Dad?

726
00:52:18.882 --> 00:52:21.407
What's an order to show cause?

727
00:52:21.818 --> 00:52:24.719
ln case someone wants to start
a lawsuit against you...


728
00:52:24.888 --> 00:52:29.518
...they ask the court to direct you to show
cause why they shouldn't be granted relief.


729
00:52:29.692 --> 00:52:31.284
Like being arrested?

730
00:52:31.461 --> 00:52:33.929
Technically, you're in custody.

731
00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:38.164
Why this interest in the law?
Going to follow in your father's footsteps?


732
00:52:38.334 --> 00:52:42.794
No. A friend of mine got himself mixed up
in one of them show causes.


733
00:52:42.972 --> 00:52:45.532
Too bad for your friend.

734
00:52:51.214 --> 00:52:53.580
-Dad?
-Yes, Andy?


735
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:55.980
l'm in an awful jam.

736
00:52:56.152 --> 00:52:59.349
Well, that's too bad.
What's the trouble?


737
00:52:59.522 --> 00:53:02.047
l.... You see--

738
00:53:02.325 --> 00:53:03.917
Start from the beginning.

739
00:53:04.094 --> 00:53:07.222
Well, to tell the truth,
you're partly to blame for it all.


740
00:53:07.397 --> 00:53:09.058
l am?

741
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.459
You and Polly Benedict's grandmother.

742
00:53:12.635 --> 00:53:14.500
You just tell me how l'm guilty.

743
00:53:14.671 --> 00:53:17.196
When l asked you for the money
to get a tuxedo...


744
00:53:17.373 --> 00:53:19.967
...you gave it to me.
lf you hadn't, l couldn't...


745
00:53:20.143 --> 00:53:22.805
...go to the dance
where you had to wear a tuxedo.


746
00:53:22.979 --> 00:53:25.470
When you wear a tuxedo,
you gotta take a girl...


747
00:53:25.648 --> 00:53:28.048
...and you've gotta have a car
to take her in.


748
00:53:28.218 --> 00:53:29.617
l see.

749
00:53:29.786 --> 00:53:32.277
Well, what about Polly Benedict's
grandmother?


750
00:53:32.455 --> 00:53:36.619
She took Polly away for the holidays,
so l couldn't take her to the dance.


751
00:53:36.793 --> 00:53:40.354
Because l couldn't take Polly,
l got mixed up with Beezy's girl.


752
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:44.057
-Beezy's girl?
-Cynthia. The one that's calling all the time.


753
00:53:44.234 --> 00:53:48.170
-Dad, can l talk to you man-to-man?
-That's the way l always want it to be.


754
00:53:48.338 --> 00:53:52.502
Well, man-to-man, Dad, can a guy
be in love with two girls at once?


755
00:53:56.479 --> 00:53:58.379
Both are estimable young ladies?

756
00:53:59.415 --> 00:54:02.907
Oh, well, we just do a little
hugging and kissing, Dad.


757
00:54:03.086 --> 00:54:05.577
l mean, good, clean fun,
just like Polly and me.


758
00:54:05.755 --> 00:54:07.086
Object matrimony?

759
00:54:07.257 --> 00:54:11.125
Matrimony? You don't have to worry.
l'm never gonna get married, ever.


760
00:54:11.294 --> 00:54:13.057
That's a momentous decision.

761
00:54:13.229 --> 00:54:17.632
Well, not at least until l'm middle-aged,
you know, 25 or 26.


762
00:54:18.034 --> 00:54:20.059
That's a sound idea.

763
00:54:20.236 --> 00:54:23.296
-Dad, l don't understand these modern girls.
-ln what way?


764
00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.868
Polly, for instance.
Sometimes she won't let you kiss her.


765
00:54:27.043 --> 00:54:30.342
But this Cynthia, she'll let you
kiss her whenever you want.


766
00:54:30.513 --> 00:54:33.175
She doesn't wanna swim,
play tennis, go for walks.


767
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:36.807
All she does is wanna kiss you.
l'm a nervous wreck.


768
00:54:38.087 --> 00:54:42.820
Well, of the two degrees of kissing,
which seems the most desirable to you?


769
00:54:42.992 --> 00:54:47.429
When you wanna kiss a girl and she won't
let you, you wanna kiss her all the time.


770
00:54:47.697 --> 00:54:49.460
But this Cynthia....

771
00:54:49.632 --> 00:54:53.728
Do you think it's wrong for a guy not to
want a girl kissing him all the time?


772
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:58.065
Well, what would you say?

773
00:54:58.741 --> 00:55:00.003
l don't know.

774
00:55:00.176 --> 00:55:03.077
When l only had three days
to go around with Cynthia...


775
00:55:03.246 --> 00:55:06.044
...l felt like a free man
for the first time in weeks.


776
00:55:06.216 --> 00:55:07.581
Three more days?

777
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:12.187
Yeah. l promised l'd date her up for Beezy
till Christmas, to save her for him.


778
00:55:12.355 --> 00:55:15.756
For 8 bucks--
For 8 dollars that l needed for....


779
00:55:16.859 --> 00:55:18.918
Remember, now, this is man-to-man.

780
00:55:19.696 --> 00:55:22.824
You'll know anyway tomorrow,
so l might as well tell you.


781
00:55:22.999 --> 00:55:27.629
l gave Peter Dugan $ 1 2 out of my bank
account for a down payment on a car...


782
00:55:27.804 --> 00:55:31.672
...and promised to give him
the remaining $8 by the 23rd.


783
00:55:33.576 --> 00:55:37.307
Was this before or after we had
our little talk about cars?


784
00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.607
Before. l wouldn't have done it after...

785
00:55:39.782 --> 00:55:43.718
...but l was already stuck
for the 1 2 bucks-- Dollars.


786
00:55:43.886 --> 00:55:47.515
And, well, now Beezy isn't gonna
send me the 8 bucks...


787
00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:51.319
...and Mr. Dugan's going to your court
to get an order against me...


788
00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:54.554
-...and here l am, and l'm sunk.
-l shall issue the order.


789
00:55:55.431 --> 00:55:56.898
Mr. Dugan can serve me...

790
00:55:57.066 --> 00:56:01.298
...and l'll take whatever steps l think
necessary as proper punishment for you.


791
00:56:01.638 --> 00:56:04.766
Why, you can't do that!
You mustn't do that! lt isn't human.


792
00:56:04.941 --> 00:56:09.275
Dad, why do you have to be an old crank,
way behind the times? This is 1 938!


793
00:56:09.445 --> 00:56:13.245
You made easy money in Washington.
l don't see why you can't give me $8.


794
00:56:13.416 --> 00:56:15.145
Andrew!

795
00:56:15.685 --> 00:56:17.516
Come back here.

796
00:56:20.857 --> 00:56:23.291
All right. Man-to-man.

797
00:56:23.459 --> 00:56:25.984
You've asked me a question,
and l'll answer it.


798
00:56:26.162 --> 00:56:30.690
That money, that unexpected windfall,
must never be touched.


799
00:56:30.867 --> 00:56:32.732
-Do you know why?
-Why?


800
00:56:32.902 --> 00:56:35.894
That's to guarantee you
a college education...


801
00:56:36.072 --> 00:56:40.372
...so you, your sister and your mother
will have resources to take care of them...


802
00:56:40.543 --> 00:56:44.377
-...in case l'm not able to.
-ln case you lose your job?


803
00:56:44.547 --> 00:56:46.378
No.

804
00:56:46.582 --> 00:56:49.176
But a man doesn't live forever.

805
00:56:49.352 --> 00:56:53.288
Too frequently, l hear of men l went
to school with that have passed on...


806
00:56:53.456 --> 00:56:56.619
...and l'm shocked to learn
that they leave boys like you...


807
00:56:56.793 --> 00:57:01.196
...and girls like your sister and wives
like your mother with nothing, not a penny.


808
00:57:01.364 --> 00:57:04.458
Dad, don't you dare talk about dying.

809
00:57:04.634 --> 00:57:07.660
-We must plan for it.
-l can't stand it.


810
00:57:07.837 --> 00:57:10.431
l can't let myself think about
you not being here.


811
00:57:10.606 --> 00:57:12.096
All right, Andy.

812
00:57:12.275 --> 00:57:14.436
Do you want into that kind of money...

813
00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:17.306
...or shall we let it
all remain in the bank?

814
00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.608
Give me a good licking.
l'd rather have that than more talk.


815
00:57:20.783 --> 00:57:25.186
No, that's why l used words
instead of a slipper on your pants.


816
00:57:25.722 --> 00:57:27.587
Are you feeling all right, Dad?

817
00:57:27.757 --> 00:57:29.748
Yes, l feel all right.

818
00:57:29.926 --> 00:57:32.952
-Have you been to the doctor lately?
-No. What are you--


819
00:57:33.129 --> 00:57:37.031
-Here. l'll get you a pillow.
-No, no. There's nothing wrong with me.


820
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.930
Oh, l understand.

821
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:42.497
Well, don't you worry.

822
00:57:42.672 --> 00:57:46.608
Barring accidents, l expect to be
with you for a long time yet.


823
00:57:46.943 --> 00:57:49.844
Maybe you'd better take a tonic.
Once or twice a day.


824
00:57:50.012 --> 00:57:53.880
Maybe you don't get enough sleep.
A little castor oil would do the trick.


825
00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:59.317
No, no, no. There's nothing--
Let's just dismiss our problem.


826
00:57:59.489 --> 00:58:02.219
Remember that your mother
is a long way from here...


827
00:58:02.392 --> 00:58:05.361
...and she's got a serious
problem all her own.


828
00:58:05.528 --> 00:58:07.496
Why? Did you get a telegram from her?

829
00:58:07.663 --> 00:58:11.190
No, but l have a feeling Mother's
not very happy at this minute.


830
00:58:11.367 --> 00:58:13.130
Did you get a message...

831
00:58:13.469 --> 00:58:15.096
...kind of a thought, a telepathy?

832
00:58:15.271 --> 00:58:17.171
lt doesn't matter what you call it.

833
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:22.004
After two people have lived as close as
your mother and me after all these years...


834
00:58:22.178 --> 00:58:24.339
...you sense things about each other.

835
00:58:24.514 --> 00:58:27.278
Why don't you send her
a wire and make sure?


836
00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:29.315
They haven't any telephone.

837
00:58:29.485 --> 00:58:33.012
Besides, a telegram is always
so startling to your mother.


838
00:58:33.189 --> 00:58:36.352
l'd give anything to let
her know we're trying to help her.


839
00:58:36.526 --> 00:58:40.690
l know how we could get word to Mom
without upsetting her. By using a ham.


840
00:58:40.863 --> 00:58:43.161
-A ham?
-A ham outfit. A radio.


841
00:58:43.332 --> 00:58:45.823
Jimmy MacMahon's got one.
We could have him--


842
00:58:46.002 --> 00:58:47.993
Wait a minute. Hold on.

843
00:58:48.171 --> 00:58:51.140
l don't believe Jimmy MacMahon
would be very eager to--


844
00:58:51.307 --> 00:58:52.672
Why not?

845
00:58:52.842 --> 00:58:54.776
Because he was in your court once?

846
00:58:54.944 --> 00:58:59.381
Dad, kids don't hold a grudge against old
folks just because they punish them.


847
00:58:59.549 --> 00:59:01.073
-No?
-Certainly not.


848
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:05.914
lf they did, everybody would be hating
their father. Which, of course, they don't.


849
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:09.954
Don't they, Andy?

850
00:59:10.126 --> 00:59:14.620
-You ought to know, Dad.
-Yes, l know, son. l know.


851
00:59:14.797 --> 00:59:19.427
Tell me, now, what about this Jimmy
MacMahon's ham? What do we....


852
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.476
Dad, write the message.
Soon as he gets it--


853
00:59:30.646 --> 00:59:34.412
All set? Quiet, please.
Here we go.


854
00:59:34.584 --> 00:59:37.678
This is W8XZR calling
CQ, Brigham, Canada.


855
00:59:37.854 --> 00:59:40.482
W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada.

856
00:59:40.656 --> 00:59:41.987
Emergency.

857
00:59:42.158 --> 00:59:45.321
W8XZR calling anybody
near Brigham, Canada.


858
00:59:45.495 --> 00:59:47.360
Okay. Come in, Brigham.

859
00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:49.862
You mean to tell me that he can--

860
00:59:50.032 --> 00:59:53.490
He contacts some bird with a
ham radio near Grandmother's farm...


861
00:59:53.669 --> 00:59:56.661
...and then this fellow,
without disturbing anybody...


862
00:59:56.839 --> 00:59:59.069
...goes and gives the message to Mom.

863
00:59:59.242 --> 01:00:01.642
-Amazing.
-There's nothing amazing about it.


864
01:00:01.811 --> 01:00:05.212
-Kids are doing it all over.
-We once got a guy in Australia...


865
01:00:05.381 --> 01:00:10.785
...when the telephone people couldn't find
him. Relax, because it takes quite a while.


866
01:00:12.555 --> 01:00:18.983
This is W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham,
Canada. W8XZR calling CQ, CQ, CQ.


867
01:00:21.197 --> 01:00:25.031
This is W8XZR calling
CQ, Brigham, Canada.


868
01:00:25.201 --> 01:00:28.898
W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada.

869
01:00:29.071 --> 01:00:32.404
W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada.

870
01:00:32.575 --> 01:00:35.305
Okay, come in, Brigham.

871
01:00:38.781 --> 01:00:43.775
<i>This is VE3A VS at Brigham, Canada,</i>
<i>calling W8XZR.</i>


872
01:00:43.953 --> 01:00:45.716
Got him!

873
01:00:45.888 --> 01:00:52.259
<i>This is VE3A VS calling W8XZR.</i>
<i>Come in, W8XZR.</i>


874
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:54.758
This is W8XZR.

875
01:00:54.931 --> 01:00:57.525
Listen, Brigham, get this right.

876
01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:02.296
Emergency. Will you take down a message
and get it to the Forrest farm near Brigham?


877
01:01:02.471 --> 01:01:07.135
No telephone. Sickness, maybe death in the

There you are, judge.
There's nothing to do but wait.


889
01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:56.724
Well....

890
01:01:56.892 --> 01:01:59.690
l never expected to see
anything like this in my life.


891
01:01:59.862 --> 01:02:03.059
You're still alive, Pop,
and you're seeing it now.


892

Go ahead, VE3AVS.


896
01:02:26.155 --> 01:02:30.148
<i>I got in through the back door</i>

old man. Thanks a million.


912

l'll do the same for you sometime.

913

Say, who are you?

914
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:35.484
How old are you? Where's your place?
Come on in, VE3AVS.


915
01:03:35.658 --> 01:03:39.219
<i>Hello, W8XZR.</i>

<i>Come in, W8XZR.</i>

920
01:03:52.775 --> 01:03:54.936
All right, Basil.
Thanks again.


921
01:03:55.111 --> 01:04:01.175
So 73 and lots of DX.
This is W8XZR signing off for the night.


922
01:04:02.384 --> 01:04:05.478
Twelve years old.

923
01:04:05.654 --> 01:04:07.053
l wouldn't believe it.

924
01:04:07.223 --> 01:04:10.750
Well, Dad, boys are good
for something after all, aren't they?


925
01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:12.989
Jimmy...

926
01:04:13.162 --> 01:04:17.121
...l'm going to send a check tomorrow
for the damage to that tractor.


927
01:04:17.299 --> 01:04:20.666
And man-to-man, thank you.

928
01:04:20.836 --> 01:04:23.862
That's all right, judge.
Thank you.


929
01:04:24.039 --> 01:04:28.533
And as for that tractor smashup,
well, l had it coming.


930
01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:32.408
Heaven only knows what
this generation has coming.


931
01:04:51.767 --> 01:04:54.668
-Oh, hello.
-lt's Betsy.


932
01:04:54.837 --> 01:04:59.137
Excuse me, Judge Hardy.
l just came over to see how Andy--


933
01:04:59.308 --> 01:05:01.868
Marian said l could wait here
until you got back.


934
01:05:02.044 --> 01:05:04.877
-Where is Marian?
-Going over the household accounts.


935
01:05:05.047 --> 01:05:07.641
She can't figure out why food
costs so much.


936
01:05:07.817 --> 01:05:10.911
About that other business,
do whatever you think l deserve.


937
01:05:11.086 --> 01:05:14.180
l'll tell you what l'm gonna
do about that, Andrew.


938
01:05:14.356 --> 01:05:17.985
l'm going down to Peter Dugan's
place tomorrow morning...


939
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.718
...and get you your car.

940
01:05:19.895 --> 01:05:23.262
-Gosh! Thanks, Dad!
-Andy, you'll have your own car!


941
01:05:23.432 --> 01:05:25.400
Sure! l got my new car!

942
01:05:25.568 --> 01:05:27.229
-Good night, Betsy.
-Good night.


943
01:05:27.403 --> 01:05:28.961
Good night, and thanks again.

944
01:05:29.138 --> 01:05:32.232
lt's swell when both fellas think
the other guy done him a favor.


945
01:05:32.408 --> 01:05:34.308
-''Did.''
-Did. And how.


946
01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:37.639
-Good night, Betsy.
-Good night, Dad.


947
01:05:39.148 --> 01:05:40.638
-Andy.
-Yeah?


948
01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:43.979
What are you going to do
about your two girls?


949
01:05:45.487 --> 01:05:47.478
Gosh-all hemlock.

950
01:05:47.656 --> 01:05:50.784
l can't take two girls to a dance.

951
01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.452
We've gotta figure out how
to settle things without any trouble.


952
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.758
l wanna take Polly.
She's the best-looking girl in Carvel.


953
01:05:57.933 --> 01:05:59.662
But l can't get rid of Cynthia.

954
01:05:59.835 --> 01:06:03.396
Cynthia's a stunner.
She's gonna wear a sensational dress.


955
01:06:03.572 --> 01:06:07.406
But if l take Cynthia to the dance,
Polly will never speak to me again.


956
01:06:10.946 --> 01:06:15.349
Andy, what if Cynthia accidentally
learned about Polly...


957
01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:20.716
-...and Polly about Cynthia?
-Don't even speak it. Then l'd have no girl.


958
01:06:22.124 --> 01:06:24.388
We couldn't have that, could we?

959
01:06:25.561 --> 01:06:30.225
But suppose you found another girl
that Polly wouldn't be jealous of.


960
01:06:30.399 --> 01:06:31.866
You don't understand.

961
01:06:32.034 --> 01:06:35.026
Sensational girls don't come
a dime a dozen in Carvel.


962
01:06:35.204 --> 01:06:38.173
Well, does she have to be
so awfully sensational?


963
01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.537
Does she have to be sensational?
To drive up in my new car...


964
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:44.406
...me in my tuxedo,
to say nothing of the opera hat?


965
01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.946
Does she have to be sensational?

966
01:06:47.983 --> 01:06:49.678
l see.

967
01:06:53.355 --> 01:06:57.815
l guess no girl in the world would be
sensational enough for that.


968
01:06:57.993 --> 01:07:01.019
-Good night, Andy.
-Good night, Betsy.


969
01:07:01.196 --> 01:07:05.064
How long does it take for a letter
to get from Carvel to Chicago and back?


970
01:07:05.234 --> 01:07:08.260
l don't know. lt depends
how quickly it's answered. Why?


971
01:07:08.437 --> 01:07:12.237
Nothing. l was just wondering why Mother
hadn't answered my last letter.


972
01:07:12.408 --> 01:07:15.605
-Good night, Andy.
-Good night, Betsy.


973
01:07:22.151 --> 01:07:25.746
Polly, if you're still my girl
after this mess is cleared up...


974
01:07:25.921 --> 01:07:28.890
...l'll never go in for polygamy again.

975
01:07:39.268 --> 01:07:42.760
There's a lot of power,
but l can't let her out all the way yet.


976
01:07:42.938 --> 01:07:47.272
Yes, l can feel it straining
at the leash right now.


977
01:07:55.818 --> 01:07:59.254
Wait just a minute, Dad.
l'll get it. l'll get it.


978
01:08:02.858 --> 01:08:06.123
When l put my new radiator cap on,
we'll go for a long drive.


979
01:08:06.295 --> 01:08:10.493
l think l'd better stay close to the
house in case there's word from Mother.


980
01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:14.568
lt's kind of a tough day before Christmas,
ain't it-- lsn't it?


981
01:08:14.737 --> 01:08:17.535
Especially for Mother.

982
01:08:31.186 --> 01:08:34.622
After that business in the drugstore,
l had to explain to you.


983
01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:38.726
-Awfully sweet of you.
-You mustn't ever be jealous of me.


984
01:08:38.894 --> 01:08:41.727
Andy's simply thrilled
he's taking you to the dance.


985
01:08:41.897 --> 01:08:44.092
-He says you're different.
-l don't know.


986
01:08:44.266 --> 01:08:46.393
You have an important
social position...


987
01:08:46.568 --> 01:08:50.527
...and with a big formal dance, he
couldn't afford to take you any old way.


988
01:08:50.706 --> 01:08:51.900
Well?

989
01:08:52.074 --> 01:08:55.202
So he bought a car
so he could bring you in style.


990
01:08:56.779 --> 01:09:01.910
l wish l could be there to see you looking
gorgeous in a new evening dress...


991
01:09:02.084 --> 01:09:06.919
...driving up with Andy in his own car
and everybody staring and....


992
01:09:07.089 --> 01:09:10.388
-Have you seen the car?
-Yes. He showed it to me at Dugan's...


993
01:09:10.559 --> 01:09:12.550
...where he's buying it.

994
01:09:12.728 --> 01:09:16.755
Well, this is Dugan's now.

995
01:09:19.068 --> 01:09:24.301
And here's Andy's car. They've
got it all fixed up and ready for him.


996
01:09:30.112 --> 01:09:32.808
Does he expect me to ride
in this junk heap?


997
01:09:32.981 --> 01:09:37.077
Your dress might get dirty, but
he'll cover the seat with a piece of carpet--


998
01:09:37.252 --> 01:09:40.016
Me, in a thing like this.

999
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:43.852
Well, l'll have a few words
to say to Mr. Andrew Hardy.


1000
01:09:44.026 --> 01:09:47.689
Of all the nerve. Well!

1001
01:09:52.835 --> 01:09:55.736
<i>I</i>´<i>ve never been so
insulted in all my life.</i>

1002
01:09:55.904 --> 01:09:59.396
You aren't fit to take a girl out
who's been used to the very best.


1003
01:09:59.575 --> 01:10:02.043
Don't you ever try to see me again,
Mr. Hardy.


1004
01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:06.438
<i>Riding in such a wreck. It</i>´<i>s insulting!</i>
<i>Don</i>´<i>t ever come to my house again.</i>


1005
01:10:06.615 --> 01:10:09.812
<i>And don</i>´<i>t you ever try</i>
<i>to see me again, ever!</i>


1006
01:10:09.985 --> 01:10:14.684
lf you don't stop hollering, you're liable
to get big muscles all over your face.


1007
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:30.003
Hey, Betsy! Oh, boy, oh, boy!
What do you think has happened?


1008
01:10:30.172 --> 01:10:33.266
-What? Tell me!
-Cynthia won't go to the dance!


1009
01:10:33.442 --> 01:10:36.639
That's a shame. She had such
a sensational evening dress.


1010
01:10:36.812 --> 01:10:39.508
We're gonna go and square it with Polly.

1011
01:10:39.681 --> 01:10:42.741
l don't think l'd better.
l don't know Polly.


1012
01:10:42.918 --> 01:10:47.582
You'd love Polly. l'm sure she'd like you.
Come on, she adores children. Come on.


1013
01:10:47.756 --> 01:10:49.986
Come on, Betsy. Come on in.

1014
01:11:13.715 --> 01:11:16.149
Hello, Polly.

1015
01:11:16.318 --> 01:11:19.845
-l see you got my message.
-Yes.


1016
01:11:20.022 --> 01:11:23.355
The butler gave me your message,
and it was very clear.


1017
01:11:23.525 --> 01:11:26.085
Don't be sore at me.
l can explain everything.


1018
01:11:26.261 --> 01:11:29.992
lf you can explain this,
you're smarter than l think you are.


1019
01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:33.066
Smarter than l thought you were.

1020
01:11:33.235 --> 01:11:36.864
Can l come in and talk to you
for just a minute?


1021
01:11:37.039 --> 01:11:41.806
l suppose one can't very well turn
a former friend from the door.


1022
01:11:51.386 --> 01:11:55.516
l only took the other girl out while you were
away. You weren't gonna be here--


1023
01:11:55.691 --> 01:11:57.955
You didn't know until
the day before l left.


1024
01:11:58.126 --> 01:12:01.994
-You gotta be polite to people, don't you?
-Did you take walks with her?


1025
01:12:02.164 --> 01:12:03.927
No.

1026
01:12:04.733 --> 01:12:07.167
A fellow has gotta have a little exercise.

1027
01:12:07.336 --> 01:12:10.237
-Did you put your arm around her?
-No.


1028
01:12:10.439 --> 01:12:12.430
Maybe just a little bit.

1029
01:12:13.008 --> 01:12:15.476
You-
- You kissed her too.

1030
01:12:15.644 --> 01:12:20.274
Polly, you make it sound--
l didn't like it. Honest, l didn't...


1031
01:12:20.449 --> 01:12:21.916
...very much.

1032
01:12:22.584 --> 01:12:25.485
Don't be mad.
l don't like any other girl except you.


1033
01:12:25.654 --> 01:12:28.452
All the time,
l was wishing you were here.


1034
01:12:28.624 --> 01:12:29.955
Who's the girl?

1035
01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.490
l can't tell you, Polly.

1036
01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:35.357
Andrew Hardy, you tell me who she is.

1037
01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:37.794
Cynthia Potter.

1038
01:12:37.966 --> 01:12:40.560
That awful red-headed creature?

1039
01:12:40.736 --> 01:12:43.296
-Andy, how could you?
-l don't know, Polly.


1040
01:12:43.472 --> 01:12:46.771
l must have been out of my mind,
but l needed $8.


1041
01:12:46.942 --> 01:12:50.378
Beezy said he'd give it to me
if l'd date up Cynthia for him.


1042
01:12:50.545 --> 01:12:53.946
-What?
-You see, it was only for financial reasons.


1043
01:12:54.116 --> 01:12:55.845
For money?

1044
01:12:56.018 --> 01:12:59.613
Andrew Hardy, that's the most
contemptible, the most--


1045
01:12:59.788 --> 01:13:02.120
You're nothing but a gigolo.

1046
01:13:02.291 --> 01:13:05.260
l never want to see you again
as long as l live.


1047
01:13:05.427 --> 01:13:08.294
Polly!
Polly, wait a minute.


1048
01:13:08.463 --> 01:13:12.297
Besides, when l got your message, l made
a date with a man from New York.


1049
01:13:12.467 --> 01:13:16.130
And he's wearing
full dress and a silk hat.


1050
01:13:16.305 --> 01:13:18.739
Wait till you see who he is.

1051
01:13:23.178 --> 01:13:25.339
Polly.

1052
01:13:44.099 --> 01:13:45.259
Well?

1053
01:13:45.734 --> 01:13:47.759
She never wants to see me again.

1054
01:13:58.413 --> 01:14:01.871
l doubt if Thomas Edison
himself could have done better.


1055
01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:06.009
lt's lovely, Dad, but l do think Andrew
might have helped a little.


1056
01:14:06.188 --> 01:14:12.286
He's sitting in, walking around, polishing
and pouring out his heart to his new car.


1057
01:14:12.994 --> 01:14:16.054
But it is about time he came in.

1058
01:14:16.898 --> 01:14:20.766
Well, anyway, the tree's done.

1059
01:14:31.313 --> 01:14:34.111
Well, why don't you sleep out here...

1060
01:14:34.282 --> 01:14:38.275
-...or take the car to bed with you?
-l wouldn't get to sleep anyway, Pop.


1061
01:14:38.453 --> 01:14:41.422
l guess l was just too smart
for myself this time.


1062
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:45.356
First l had two girls and no car,
and now l got a car and no girl.


1063
01:14:45.694 --> 01:14:47.753
There just isn't any justice.

1064
01:14:47.929 --> 01:14:49.226
Andrew...

1065
01:14:49.398 --> 01:14:54.859
...for years l've been administering justice
as l thought the guilty ones deserved it.


1066
01:14:55.036 --> 01:14:58.369
You'd be surprised at the number
of people who define justice...


1067
01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.475
...as something they think
they'd like to get.


1068
01:15:01.643 --> 01:15:05.101
-Why don't you go to the dance alone?
-Stag? No.


1069
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:08.511
The fellows would think l couldn't
get a girl. l'd be ruined.


1070
01:15:08.683 --> 01:15:11.846
l just can't take any girl.
She's gotta be a knockout.


1071
01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:14.818
Well, that's not exactly
a new thought either.


1072
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:18.790
-Well, don't stay out here too long.
-l won't.


1073
01:15:39.948 --> 01:15:42.917
Betsy, you've grown up.

1074
01:15:43.084 --> 01:15:45.052
Am l sensational?

1075
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.154
l'll say.

1076
01:15:47.322 --> 01:15:51.588
Andy, even though l'm only a little girl,
even little girls can see ahead.


1077
01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.060
l was afraid there might be trouble,
so l wrote Mother. She always understands.


1078
01:15:56.231 --> 01:15:59.428
She's the one that sent me
this sensational dress.


1079
01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:03.002
She said that just once before
l left Carvel l could be grown-up.


1080
01:16:03.171 --> 01:16:08.404
She even sent me a wrap.
That's for the long drive home in the dark...


1081
01:16:08.577 --> 01:16:10.340
...even though l'm not Cynthia.

1082
01:16:10.512 --> 01:16:15.916
This will be a world's record! l'm gonna go
put on my tuxedo and my opera hat.


1083
01:16:16.084 --> 01:16:19.178
Maybe l'll shave!

1084
01:16:36.972 --> 01:16:39.634
See that it's parked.
And mind the fenders.


1085
01:16:39.808 --> 01:16:42.641
Yes, sir.

1086
01:17:00.762 --> 01:17:03.060
Tonight's my big night, Andy.

1087
01:17:03.231 --> 01:17:06.564
l hope l don't break my neck.
These heels are two inches high...


1088
01:17:06.735 --> 01:17:09.169
...and they're killing me.

1089
01:17:10.472 --> 01:17:12.770
l'll tell you about that later, Alan.

1090
01:17:13.808 --> 01:17:17.209
This is not like the swell shindigs
in Washington.


1091
01:17:17.379 --> 01:17:20.576
There are so many ambassadors,
any time you do a Big Apple...


1092
01:17:20.749 --> 01:17:22.341
...you insult half of Europe.

1093
01:17:22.517 --> 01:17:26.977
-l think it's grand.
-Well, it's pretty swell.


1094
01:17:27.589 --> 01:17:31.958
Do we seem provincial, Dennis, after all
the wonderful parties you've played for?


1095
01:17:32.127 --> 01:17:37.121
Of course not. l think the party's charming.
Hope they like our music.


1096
01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.664
-Hello, Andy. How are you?
-Hello, Gene.


1097
01:17:40.835 --> 01:17:42.666
-Hi, Andy. How are you?
-Fine.


1098
01:17:42.837 --> 01:17:46.637
-Good evening, Andy. Glad to see you.
-Freddy.


1099
01:17:48.176 --> 01:17:50.610
Say, that girl, the one in blue.

1100
01:17:50.779 --> 01:17:52.178
l've seen her in New York.

1101
01:17:52.347 --> 01:17:55.839
lf you mean that infant trying to look
grown-up, l don't know...


1102
01:17:56.017 --> 01:17:59.646
-...but she certainly isn't in good company.
-l'm sure l know her.


1103
01:17:59.821 --> 01:18:03.655
Of course. Martha Booth's daughter.
Excuse me a moment.


1104
01:18:04.192 --> 01:18:06.524
Pardon me. Aren't you Betsy Booth?

1105
01:18:06.695 --> 01:18:10.153
-Why, yes, l am.
-Wait a minute. lf he's trying to get fresh--


1106
01:18:10.332 --> 01:18:12.562
l beg your pardon,
but l know Miss Booth.


1107
01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:15.294
Your mom brought you
to my father's in New York.


1108
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:18.769
-Who's your father?
-Caldwell Hunt, the composer. l'm Dennis.


1109
01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.271
Dennis Hunt's Harmonists?

1110
01:18:20.442 --> 01:18:23.570
Certainly. You played for me
to sing your signature song.


1111
01:18:23.745 --> 01:18:26.009
-We had fun.
-What are you doing out here?


1112
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:27.580
Just visiting.

1113
01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:30.809
Help me start the party with a bang.
Come sing.


1114
01:18:30.986 --> 01:18:34.285
-This is a dance.
-lt'll be better when Betsy warms it up.


1115
01:18:34.456 --> 01:18:37.721
-Come on, Betsy, and sing for us.
-All right. Excuse me, Andy.


1116
01:18:39.361 --> 01:18:43.229
Betsy, a lot of my friends are here.
Do you think you've practiced enough?


1117
01:18:43.398 --> 01:18:44.990
She'll be a sensation.

1118
01:18:45.166 --> 01:18:48.067
l've always wanted you
to hear me sing, Andy.


1119
01:18:48.236 --> 01:18:50.670
-l'd love to.
-Swell.


1120
01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:54.036
Ladies and gentlemen.

1121
01:18:54.843 --> 01:18:57.038
l know it's not Christmas
till midnight...


1122
01:18:57.212 --> 01:19:00.704
...but here's a present for
everybody that just has to be opened.


1123
01:19:00.882 --> 01:19:06.149
Miss Betsy Booth, daughter of that famous
musical comedy star Martha Booth.


1124
01:19:06.321 --> 01:19:08.346
Miss Booth, by special request...

1125
01:19:08.823 --> 01:19:10.347
...my own special request...

1126
01:19:10.525 --> 01:19:13.722
...will sing for us
''lt Never Rains But What lt Pours.''


1127
01:23:32.687 --> 01:23:35.986
Ladies and gentlemen,
as a gesture of our appreciation...


1128
01:23:36.157 --> 01:23:39.558
...l suggest Miss Booth
be invited to lead the grand march.


1129
01:23:46.634 --> 01:23:49.068
l'll lead with the gentleman
who brought me.


1130
01:23:49.237 --> 01:23:50.568
Certainly. Who is he?

1131
01:23:50.738 --> 01:23:53.400
Mr. Andrew Hardy.

1132
01:23:54.309 --> 01:23:56.743
May l have the honor, Mr. Hardy?

1133
01:23:56.911 --> 01:23:59.277
You're doggone tooting you can!

1134
01:23:59.447 --> 01:24:02.177
Ladies and gentlemen,
your partners for the grand march.


1135
01:24:06.521 --> 01:24:09.422
-l have a splitting headache.
-l'm terribly sorry.


1136
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:13.026
-l'll take you home.
-No, you have to stay.


1137
01:24:13.194 --> 01:24:15.526
Carl will take me home.

1138
01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:35.013
lt was grand.

1139
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:39.012
What's the matter, Andy?

1140
01:24:39.187 --> 01:24:41.678
Wasn't l sensational enough?

1141
01:24:41.856 --> 01:24:47.385
You were the most terrific, marvelous,
sensational girl that ever lived.


1142
01:24:48.496 --> 01:24:50.054
Well, what's the matter?

1143
01:24:51.699 --> 01:24:53.428
l don't know.

1144
01:24:54.702 --> 01:24:56.397
l do.

1145
01:24:56.671 --> 01:24:58.298
lt's Polly.

1146
01:25:00.041 --> 01:25:02.942
We'll pick up your Christmas present
on the way home...


1147
01:25:03.111 --> 01:25:05.511
...so you can open it in the morning.

1148
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.477
Yes, Andy.

1149
01:25:28.503 --> 01:25:31.870
Here you are. Merry Christmas,
and thanks a million for tonight.


1150
01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.770
l'll bring yours over first thing
in the morning.


1151
01:25:34.942 --> 01:25:37.376
No. You've done too much
for me already.


1152
01:25:37.545 --> 01:25:39.570
Hello, Betsy.
Hello, Andy.


1153
01:25:39.747 --> 01:25:41.738
-Hi.
-Hello.


1154
01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.644
Well, children.

1155
01:25:47.822 --> 01:25:49.847
l was just leaving my presents.

1156
01:25:50.024 --> 01:25:52.686
l just brought Betsy in for her present.

1157
01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.987
Anything happen yet, Dad?

1158
01:25:55.163 --> 01:25:59.600
No, no. Still no word from Mother.

1159
01:25:59.967 --> 01:26:01.594
Gee.

1160
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:04.830
Well, it's after 1 2:00.

1161
01:26:06.774 --> 01:26:08.639
lt's Christmas.

1162
01:26:10.211 --> 01:26:12.372
Merry Christmas to you, Marian...

1163
01:26:13.081 --> 01:26:15.777
-...Andy, Betsy.
-Merry Christmas, Dad.


1164
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:18.612
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.


1165
01:26:19.153 --> 01:26:21.917
A heck of a Christmas this is!

1166
01:26:24.826 --> 01:26:27.624
-A telegram.
-l'll get it!


1167
01:26:30.331 --> 01:26:31.593
Mom!

1168
01:26:31.766 --> 01:26:33.996
Andy, baby!

1169
01:26:34.168 --> 01:26:36.636
-Merry Christmas!
-Mother!


1170
01:26:36.804 --> 01:26:39.136
-Mom!
-Oh, darling.


1171
01:26:39.307 --> 01:26:41.036
Hello, honey.

1172
01:26:42.043 --> 01:26:44.876
Why, Emily, how could you--?
What happened?


1173
01:26:45.046 --> 01:26:47.105
-Didn't you get my telegram?
-Telegram?


1174
01:26:47.281 --> 01:26:49.579
-Did you send one?
-Why, of course.


1175
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.480
Mother came through
her crisis with flying colors.


1176
01:26:52.653 --> 01:26:56.020
l left Milly in charge and came
home for Christmas by airplane.


1177
01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:59.887
What? You, in an airplane
all the way from Brigham at night?


1178
01:27:00.061 --> 01:27:01.722
Why, of course. l loved it.

1179
01:27:01.896 --> 01:27:04.330
Okay, everybody's crazy.

1180
01:27:05.733 --> 01:27:08.099
What was it you said about a telegram?

1181
01:27:08.269 --> 01:27:13.866
Oh, James. lsn't that just like me?
l forgot to send it from the airport.


1182
01:27:14.041 --> 01:27:17.067
Oh, dear. My fingers are all thumbs.
Here it is.


1183
01:27:17.245 --> 01:27:20.442
l wouldn't be surprised if Grandma
isn't sitting up tomorrow.


1184
01:27:20.615 --> 01:27:24.244
-Merry Christmas, my dear.
-Yes, sir! lt's a Merry Christmas.


1185
01:27:24.418 --> 01:27:26.784
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Betsy!


1186
01:27:26.954 --> 01:27:32.620
Merry Christmas, Andy! Don't you worry
about Polly. Everything's gonna be just fine.


1187
01:27:32.793 --> 01:27:34.556
Yeah.

1188
01:27:34.896 --> 01:27:36.989
Oh, yeah.

1189
01:27:54.916 --> 01:27:56.178
Hello.

1190
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:59.478
-What do you want?
-l came to wish you a Merry Christmas.


1191
01:27:59.654 --> 01:28:00.951
Merry Christmas.

1192
01:28:01.122 --> 01:28:03.147
That's not a very
nice way to say it.

1193
01:28:03.324 --> 01:28:07.283
Andy, l just found out that
Mr. Hunt is Polly's cousin.


1194
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:10.157
Cousin! Yeah?

1195
01:28:10.331 --> 01:28:12.629
Oh, well, then l'm
glad to know you, bud.

1196
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.665
Andy, will you drive me over--

1197
01:28:14.835 --> 01:28:18.134
-l didn't know you were busy.
-l'm Dennis Hunt, Polly's cousin.


1198
01:28:18.306 --> 01:28:21.901
-l'm Marian Hardy, Andrew's sister.
-Andy seems to be busy right now.


1199
01:28:22.076 --> 01:28:24.567
-Let me give you a ride.
-lt's too much trouble.


1200
01:28:24.745 --> 01:28:27.407
On the contrary.
lt can be your present to me.


1201
01:28:27.582 --> 01:28:30.278
-Oh, Mr. Hunt.
-Come on. Shall we go?


1202
01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:40.627
l said some nasty things yesterday.
l'm sorry.


1203
01:28:40.795 --> 01:28:43.491
Nothing you ever said meant a thing.

1204
01:28:44.098 --> 01:28:45.861
l mean....

1205
01:28:46.033 --> 01:28:49.366
Well, l guess l better
go and unpack my presents.


1206
01:28:49.537 --> 01:28:52.802
lt was sweet of you to come
talk to me this morning, Betsy.


1207
01:28:52.974 --> 01:28:55.670
You mean Betsy squared everything?

1208
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:58.470
Gee, Betsy, you're the swellest girl....

1209
01:28:58.646 --> 01:29:03.640
l didn't do anything.
You just had some troubles.


1210
01:29:03.818 --> 01:29:07.811
l sure did. Anybody else had my troubles
wouldn't have figured a way out.


1211
01:29:07.989 --> 01:29:13.052
Sure. You gotta be smart to get into
as much trouble as Andy does.


1212
01:29:13.227 --> 01:29:16.856
Betsy, l'll never be able to
thank you enough for last night...


1213
01:29:17.031 --> 01:29:21.161
...the radiator gadget, you wanting
to pawn your coat, Polly--


1214
01:29:21.335 --> 01:29:23.633
No, Andy.
l've gotta thank you.


1215
01:29:23.804 --> 01:29:27.672
You know what l'm gonna do? Write an
Andy Hardy page in my memory book...


1216
01:29:27.842 --> 01:29:30.436
...and read it every day for five years...

1217
01:29:30.611 --> 01:29:33.808
...because on account of you
l was grown-up for one night.


1218
01:29:33.981 --> 01:29:36.176
Just like Cinderella.

1219
01:29:36.651 --> 01:29:38.482
With an evening dress...

1220
01:29:38.653 --> 01:29:42.885
...and high heels
and leading a grand march.


1221
01:29:43.658 --> 01:29:49.790
You see, Andy, now l know how wonderful
life's gonna be when l'm 1 8.


1222
01:29:50.831 --> 01:29:52.856
And you did it all.

1223
01:29:54.835 --> 01:29:56.427
Well...

1224
01:29:56.604 --> 01:29:58.071
...so long.

1225
01:30:03.678 --> 01:30:07.808
-You're not mad at me anymore, Polly?
-Not if you'll tell me one thing.


1226
01:30:07.982 --> 01:30:09.882
What's that?

1227
01:30:10.051 --> 01:30:14.420
Did you like kissing Cynthia
better than kissing me?


1228
01:30:18.225 --> 01:30:20.386
Well...

1229
01:30:20.561 --> 01:30:25.430
...it's been so long since l kissed you
that l....


1230
01:30:32.873 --> 01:30:35.706
Well, what about Cynthia now?

1231
01:30:35.876 --> 01:30:39.073
Cynthia was just one of the errors
of my childhood...


1232
01:30:39.246 --> 01:30:41.476
...but you, Polly....

1233
01:31:15.149 --> 01:31:16.138
