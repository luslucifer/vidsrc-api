86
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.377
왜 그래?
우울해 보이네

Just take his order,
 look him in the eye.


94
00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.898
그냥 주문을 받고
눈을 쳐다 봐


95
00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:50.010
농담을 하면 정말
재미있는듯이 웃어주면 돼


96
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.165
If he says anything remotely funny,
 laugh like you never heard anything

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.371
And smile!

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:24.132
친구 할 수 있겠지?

114
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.704
So what can I get you?

115

Hey! You guys had shirts on

00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:44.740
배우고 알았으면
똑바로 행동해


156
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.208
Learn it.
 Know it. Live it.


157
00:05:48.485 --> 00:05:49.210
와

158
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.213
- Whoa.
 - He's the full hot orator.


159
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.454
끝내주는 웅변가야

160
00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:53.080
린다, 내가 이거 보여줬니?
그 오빠가 명함 줬다


161
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.256
Linda, did I show you this?
 He gave me his card.


162
00:05:56.326 --> 00:05:56.380
론 존슨, 오디오 전문 상담가

163
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.317
"Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant."

164
00:05:58.395 --> 00:05:58.580
액자 해서 벽에 걸어야겠네

165
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.761
Maybe we should get a frame for this,
 and put it up on the wall.


166
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:01.020
백화점에서 남자친구 사귈거라고
말했던건 너야


167
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.165
Linda, you're the one who told me
 I was gonna get a boyfriend at the mall.


168
00:06:05.502 --> 00:06:05.620
이번 주 안에 전화가 올까?

169
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.333
- Do you think he'll call this week?
 - Why don't you call him?


170
00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:08.632
네가 먼저 해

171
00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:08.790
못해

172
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.865
- I can't.
 - You can. Guys love that sort of thing.


173
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.341
할 수 있어!
남자들은 그런 거 좋아해


174
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.530
정말?

175
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.399
- Really?
 - Yes!


176
00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:15.638
그럼!

177
00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:15.940
스테이시, 얼마나 더 기다리려고?
너 벌써 15살이야


178
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.704
Stacy, what are you waiting for?
 You're 15 years old.


179
00:06:18.782 --> 00:06:18.910
난 13살에 첫경험 했어
대단한게 아니라 겨우 섹스야


180
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.276
I did it when I was 13.
 It's no huge thing. It's just sex.


181
00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:23.410
그 오빠 괜찮았지?

182
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.184
- He was hot, wasn't he?
 - If I didn't have a fiance
 in Chicago, I'd go for it.


183
00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.519
내 애인이 시카고에 없다면
내가 낚아챘을거다


184
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.069
Hey, how you doin'?
 Welcome to Ridgemont.


185
00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.060
난 게이다

186
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.260
Will it look okay?

187
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.840
<i>Well, she was an American girl</i>

188
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.510
<i>Raised on promises</i>

189
00:06:56.954 --> 00:06:57.680
혹시 F10 번이 어디 있는지 알어?

190
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.081
- Do you know where U.S. History is?
 - Down the hall and turn left.


191
00:06:59.156 --> 00:07:01.716
복도 끝까지 가서
왼쪽으로 가봐


192
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.350
<i>Somewhere else</i>

193
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.380
<i>She was an American girl</i>

194
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.087
Hi, Bradley.

195
00:07:30.087 --> 00:07:30.985
안녕, 브래들리

196
00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:32.210
많이 컸네
보기 좋아


197
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.613
Grown up.
 Lookin' good.


198
00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:35.050
일년 지나니 결국
키스까지 하는군


199
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.485
Another year joined at the lips.

200
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.061
- Hi, Brad!
 - Denise. I'd make you see God.


201
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.323
안녕, 브래드!

202
00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:41.796
드니스, 내가 킹카임을 보여주지

203
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.960
Brad!

204
00:07:45.602 --> 00:07:45.760
차 환상인데!

205
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.593
- Big Cruising Vessel!
 - Bradley!


206
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:49.830
고마워

207
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.800
Thank you.

208
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.042
Six more payments, gentlemen,
 and this beautiful...


209
00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:53.942
6개월만 할부를 더 부으면

210
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:55.400
이 파랗고 멋진 세단이
아주 내 차가 되지!


211
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.880
blue, four-door, luxury sedan
 is all mine!


212
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.017
I'll give you
 four tickets in the fifth row...


213
00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:02.310
다섯번째 줄 티켓 네장을

214
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.419
for the low price of $140.

215
00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:05.115
아주 저렴한 가격인

216
00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:05.850
저 차 보여?

217
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.683
See that car? Some alumni
 gave Jefferson that car...


218
00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:08.680
어느 졸업생이 제퍼슨이 2학년때
미식축구를 한다고 선물했지


219
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.488
for playing football
 when he was a sophomore.


220
00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:10.720
내가 받도록 도와줬지

221
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.188
- Helped him pick it out.
 - Slick car.


222
00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:13.558
차 끝내준다

223
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:13.690
우린 오래된 친구사이야

224
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.530
We go way back, you know.

225
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.636
Hey, Charles, how you doin', buddy?
 Car looks great. I mean really terrific.


226
00:08:19.636 --> 00:08:21.831
찰스, 잘 지냈어?

227
00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:24.271
차 좋아보이네
내 말은 차 정말 멋져


228
00:08:24.374 --> 00:08:24.400
관리를 정말 잘했구나

229
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.898
You're really keeping it up
 wonderfully.


230
00:08:27.077 --> 00:08:27.130
얼씬도 하지 마!

231
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.476
Don't fuck with it!

232
00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:34.110
이런! 내 친구들이
좀 터프 해


233
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.740
Shit!
 That's my man.


234
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.280
Brad?

235
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.392
- Arnold! What's happening?
 - Can I talk to you a minute?


236
00:08:42.392 --> 00:08:44.223
아놀드! 잘 지냈어?

237
00:08:44.294 --> 00:08:45.886
잠깐 얘기 좀 할 수 있어?

238
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.263
Sure, man.

239
00:08:46.263 --> 00:08:47.491
그래

240
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.332
I really hate Bronco Burger.

241
00:08:48.332 --> 00:08:50.596
난 정말 브론코
햄버거 숍이 싫걸랑


242
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:50.920
치킨 너겟을 팔기 시작한 이후론
맨날 적자가 나기 시작했어


243
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.668
Ever since they started with the chicken
 nuggets, everything went downhill.


244
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.104
You have to fry all their greasy food,
 and you have to polish things.


245
00:08:54.104 --> 00:08:57.770
기름기 줄줄 흐르는 음식을 튀겨서
나중에 다시 치장을 하지


246
00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.336
And the manager's an asshole.
 I was just wondering...


247
00:08:58.408 --> 00:09:02.174
매니저는 정말 못됐고
그래서 생각중인데...


248
00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:02.290
아놀드, 올 아메리칸 버거숍에서
일하고 싶다는 거니?


249
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.442
Arnold, do you want to work
 at All-American Burger?


250
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.016
Yeah, well, um...

251
00:09:06.016 --> 00:09:07.643
응, 그러니깐...

252
00:09:07.751 --> 00:09:07.770
아마 일하게 해줄수 있을거야
우리 매니저한테 물어볼게


253
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.481
I can probably get you in.
 Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.


254
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:10.787
- All right!
 - Okay.


255
00:09:10.787 --> 00:09:12.480
- 좋았어!
- 알았어


256
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.618
 132
 00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.810
 Wait.
 Did you hear the bell ring?


257
00:09:13.957 --> 00:09:15.652
잠깐, 종 쳤냐?

258
00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:15.950
- 무슨 종?
- 우린 벌써 왔잖아


259
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.819
- What bell?
 - We're here.


260
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.260
 135
 00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.370
 Aloha.


261
00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.610
알로하

262
00:09:38.348 --> 00:09:38.510
내 이름은 미스터 핸드입니다

263
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.200
My name is Mr. Hand.

264
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.853
I have but one question for you.

265
00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:44.514
질문은 단지 하나

266
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.222
Can you attend my class?

267
00:09:45.222 --> 00:09:47.486
내 수업을
빠지지 않을수 있나요?


268
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:47.824
It is for your own good. And if you
 can't make it, I can make you.


269
00:09:47.824 --> 00:09:49.655
제군들을 위한 것이고

270
00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:52.991
만약 못하겠다면
내가 그렇게 하도록 만들어 주죠


271
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.930
We have a 20-question quiz every Friday.

272
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.592
매주 금요일엔 20문제씩
쪽지 시험이 있고


273
00:09:56.667 --> 00:09:56.730
성적은 모든 쪽지 시험의
평균들과 중간고사와


274
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.534
Your grade is the average
 of all your quizzes,


275
00:09:59.703 --> 00:09:59.730
전체의 3분의 1을 차지할
기말고사의 합계로 계산 합니다


276
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.672
plus the midterm and final
 which counts for one-third.


277
00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:02.770
이해 되요?

278
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.865
Got it?

279
00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:06.170
또한...

280
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.309
Also...

281
00:10:09.946 --> 00:10:10.040
수업시간에 음식은
먹을수 없어요, 절대로...


282
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.883
There will be no eating. E
-A
-T-l
-N
-G.

283
00:10:14.985 --> 00:10:15.000
수업시간에 음식은
안돼요!


284
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.250
No eating in this class!

285
00:10:18.989 --> 00:10:19.040
개인적인 일은 개인적인 시간에
알아서들 하도록 하세요


286
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.549
You get used to doing
 your own business on your own time.


287
00:10:21.658 --> 00:10:21.680
이게 내가 요구하는
한가지 사항입니다


288
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.126
That's one demand I make.

289
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.795
Just like you wouldn't want me
 to come to your house...


290
00:10:24.795 --> 00:10:27.389
내가 자네 집에 어느날
저녁 찾아가서


291
00:10:27.497 --> 00:10:27.520
미국역사를 논하자고 하길
원하진 않겠죠?


292
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.692
- and discuss U.S. History
 on your time, understand?
 - Yes, sir.


293
00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:30.220
네

294
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.994
 152
 00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.490
 This guy's been stoned
 since the third grade.


295
00:10:35.605 --> 00:10:38.438
쟤는 초등학교 3학년때부터
맛이 갔었어


296
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.070
- 무슨 일이죠?
- 이 반에 등록 됐는데요


297
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.308
- Yes?
 - Yeah, I'm registered in this class.


298
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:42.546
- What class?
 - This is U.S. History.


299
00:10:42.546 --> 00:10:43.570
무슨 반이요?

300
00:10:43.647 --> 00:10:44.800
여기 미국 역사반 이잖아요
저기 지구본도 보이네요


301
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.309
- I see the globe right there.
 - Really?


302
00:10:46.383 --> 00:10:46.770
그래요?

303
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:47.680
Hey.
 May I come in?


304
00:10:48.852 --> 00:10:49.640
- 들어가도 돼요?
- 들어와요!


305
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.015
Oh, please!

306
00:10:52.122 --> 00:10:52.200
3교시 종이 울릴 때
내 학생들이 전부 안오면


307
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.558
I get so lonely when I hear
 that third attendance bell ring...


308
00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:55.740
나도 참 외로워 지죠

309
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.388
and all my kids are not here.

310
00:10:58.929 --> 00:10:58.990
늦어서 죄송해요, 그러니깐
새 시간표가 너무 헷갈려서요


311
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.127
Sorry, I'm late. It's just like
 this new schedule's totally confusing.


312
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.736
I know that dude!

313
00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:07.363
저 쟤 알아요!

314
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:07.704
Mr. Spicoli.

315
00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:09.672
스피콜리군

316
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:09.930
부모님이 지어준 이름이죠

317
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.605
That's the name they gave me.

318
00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:14.800
- 시간표를 찢었잖아요!
- 그랬죠


319
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.873
- You're ripping my card!
 - Yes.


320
00:11:18.682 --> 00:11:18.800
뭐가 문제야?

321
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.274
Hey, bud, what's your problem?

322
00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:22.330
아무 문제 없다네

323
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.014
No problem at all.

324
00:11:24.287 --> 00:11:24.380
교무실이 어딘지는
알거라고 믿어요


325
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.120
I think you know
 where the front office is.


326
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:28.458
You dick!

327
00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:29.948
나쁜 자식!

328
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.994
I have taken the time
 to print up a complete schedule...


329
00:11:30.994 --> 00:11:33.462
이 반의 쪽지 시험과
진도 과정을 적은


330
00:11:33.563 --> 00:11:33.590
이 반의 일정표를
준비해 왔습니다


331
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.828
of class quizzes
 and the chapters they cover.


332
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.220
뒷사람에게 전달하세요

333
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.794
Please pass them
 to the desk behind you.


334
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.604
Back, back, back.

335
00:11:40.604 --> 00:11:41.571
뒤로...

336
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.683
Did you hear about this surfer guy
 who pulled a knife on Mr. Hand
 this morning?


337
00:11:53.683 --> 00:11:56.481
오늘 아침에 제프가 핸드선생님에게
칼을 들이댄 얘기 들었어?


338
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:56.953
Oh, no!
 He just called him a dick.


339
00:11:56.953 --> 00:11:59.353
아냐!
그냥 나쁜 자식이라고만 말했어


340
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.723
A dick? Oh, God.
 People exaggerate so much here.


341
00:11:59.723 --> 00:12:03.215
나쁜 자식? 말도 안돼
정말 엄청들 불려서 소문 낸다니깐


342
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:04.961
Linda, that girl
 looks just like Pat Benatar.


343
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.397
린다, 지금 지나간 여자 얘
가수 팻 베네터 닮지 않았니?


344
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:08.765
I know. Wait.
 There are three girls at Ridgemont...


345
00:12:08.765 --> 00:12:10.756
그러게, 잠깐

346
00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:12.290
리치몬드에 그 가수 닮은
여자가 3명 있어


347
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.429
who have cultivated
 the Pat Benatar look.


348
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:14.838
Chanel Semlar,

349
00:12:14.838 --> 00:12:16.396
샤넬 셈라랑

350
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.274
Mary Ann Zlotnick
 in the red tights.


351
00:12:17.274 --> 00:12:20.072
빨간 타이즈를 입은
마리 즐토닉이랑...


352
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:20.844
Do you think guys find that
 more attractive?


353
00:12:20.844 --> 00:12:22.709
남자들이 저런걸
더 매력있어 하나?


354
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.913
Stacy, please, give me a break!
 You are so much prettier!


355
00:12:22.913 --> 00:12:26.405
말도 안 되는 소리 하지 마
쟤들보단 네가 훨씬 더 예뻐


356
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:26.650
Yeah, I know, but do you think
 they'd be better in bed?


357
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.916
그건 알지만 저런 얘들이
잠자리는 더 끝내줄까?


358
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.454
What do you mean?
 You either do it or you don't.


359
00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:33.615
무슨 소리야?
그건 하고 안하고 둘밖에 없어


360
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.191
No. There are like... variables
 that I might not be good at.


361
00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:39.151
아니, 내가 잘 못하는 것을
더 다양하게 잘할수도 있잖아


362
00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:39.360
무슨 다양함?

363
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.728
- Like what variables?
 - Like, you know, giving blow jobs.


364
00:12:41.198 --> 00:12:44.463
그러니깐...
입으로 해주는거


365
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:44.701
What's the big deal?

366
00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:45.690
그게 뭐 대단해?

367
00:12:47.237 --> 00:12:47.320
한번도 안 해봤어

368
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.397
- I never did it.
 - You've never given a blow job?


369
00:12:48.471 --> 00:12:50.939
정말 입으로
한번도 안 해봤어?


370
00:12:51.007 --> 00:12:51.030
한번도? 별거 아니야
정말 쉬워


371
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.530
Never? Stace, there's nothing to it.
 It's so easy.


372
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:56.446
Check it out.

373
00:12:56.446 --> 00:12:58.471
야! 저기 봐!

374
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.518
Relax your throat muscles.

375
00:13:01.518 --> 00:13:02.678
목 근육에 긴장 풀어

376
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.958
Don't bite.

377
00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:08.686
물진 마

378
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:10.250
그리곤 밀어 넣어

379
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.422
And slide it in.

380
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.236
Try it again.

381
00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:20.362
다시 해봐

382
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.105
Good. Push it slowly in and out.
 You got it.


383
00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:27.099
좋아, 천천히 넣었다 빼
바로 그거야


384
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.410
Okay.

385
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.604
알았어

386
00:13:29.346 --> 00:13:29.430
하나만 물어봐도 돼?
절대 웃지 마!


387
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.473
- Can I ask you something
 and you promise not to laugh?
 - Sure.


388
00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:32.270
알았어

389
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:32.742
Okay. When a guy has an orgasm,
 how much comes out?


390
00:13:33.483 --> 00:13:36.714
남자가 절정에 가면
얼마나 많이 나와?


391
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.687
A quart or so.

392
00:13:37.687 --> 00:13:39.086
한 1리터 정도

393
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.891
No, I'm just kidding.

394
00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:42.010
농담이야
연습 계속 해


395
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.621
Just practice.

396
00:13:52.369 --> 00:13:52.490
난 시체실에 안갈거야
엄마한테 메모 써달라고 할거야


397
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.702
I'm not going to a morgue.
 I'll get my mom to write a note.


398
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.506
Nobody's getting me into a room
 with a bunch of dead guys.


399
00:13:56.506 --> 00:13:59.130
죽은 시체들이 득실거리는 방에
가라곤 아무도 강요 못해


400
00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.209
You have to go.
 I hear it's part of the final.


401
00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:02.178
기말고사의 일부라
가야만 해


402
00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:02.300
정말 구역질 난다고 들었는데
왜들 가는지 알아?


403
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.804
I hear it's really disgusting.
 Do you know what they do?


404
00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:05.140
- 들었어?
- 뭘?


405
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.712
- Have you heard?
 - What?


406
00:14:06.783 --> 00:14:07.800
시체를 해부하고

407
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.183
The bodies are dissected
 and Mr. Vargas...


408
00:14:09.252 --> 00:14:10.240
바가스 선생님이 장기들을 꺼내서
들고 보여준대


409
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.348
pulls out parts of the dead body
 and holds them up.


410
00:14:13.423 --> 00:14:13.540
손을 넣고 내장들을
꺼낸단 말이야?


411
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.857
You mean, he reaches in
 and pulls this stuff out?


412
00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:15.950
위장이나 종양 같은거?

413
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.985
- Like stomach and tumors or something?
 - Yeah, stomach, tumors, entrails.


414
00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:20.086
그래, 위장이랑 종양이랑
창자들 말이야


415
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:20.931
Good day, everyone.
 My name is Mr. Vargas.


416
00:14:20.931 --> 00:14:24.025
모두 안녕
난 바가스 선생님이란다


417
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.068
Look.
 I'm a little slow today.


418
00:14:25.068 --> 00:14:27.662
오늘 내가 좀 둔할거야

419
00:14:27.737 --> 00:14:27.760
커피를 다른 상표로 바꿔서 그러니
좀 봐주길 바란다


420
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.229
I just switched to Sanka,
 so have a heart.


421
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.175
All right, now.

422
00:14:32.175 --> 00:14:33.665
좋아, 그럼

423
00:14:34.377 --> 00:14:35.070
'삶의 세계' 이게 우리가 사용할
교과서의 이름이란다


424
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.973
The World of Life. That is the name
 of the textbook we will be using.


425
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.450
I'm in love.

426
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.008
나 사랑에 빠졌어

427
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:42.919
See the mustache comin' in, Rat?

428
00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:44.944
수염 나오는거 보여?

429
00:14:46.022 --> 00:14:46.080
잡아 뺄수도 있겠어

430
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.853
You can almost cross it out.

431
00:14:49.793 --> 00:14:49.890
천사를 봤어

432
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.192
- I'm in love.
 - You are a wuss. Part wimp, part pussy.


433
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:55.061
넌 쑥맥이야...
소심하고 연약한 면도 있지


434
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:55.150
쑥맥이라니 무슨 뜻이야?
이 여자애는 내 이상형이라니깐


435
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.794
What do you mean wuss?
 This girl is my... exact type.


436
00:14:58.868 --> 00:14:59.630
어디서 봤는데?

437
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.859
- Where'd you see her?
 - In my biology class.


438
00:15:00.937 --> 00:15:02.390
생물 시간에

439
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:02.564
- Did you get her number?
 - No.


440
00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.590
- 전화번호는 받았어?
- 아니


441
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.301
- Did you get her name?
 - No! No! It's too soon.


442
00:15:05.775 --> 00:15:08.243
- 이름은 알아?
- 아니! 너무 이르잖아


443
00:15:08.445 --> 00:15:08.470
너무 이른건 없어

444
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.379
It's never too soon, Rat.

445
00:15:10.447 --> 00:15:10.460
여자랑 얼마나 갈수 있을지는
작업시작 5분안에 끝나는거야


446
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.281
A girl decides how far she's gonna
 let you go in the first five minutes.


447
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:14.617
What am I supposed to do? Go up to
 this strange girl in my biology class...


448
00:15:14.617 --> 00:15:15.743
나보고 어떻게 하라고?

449
00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:18.450
생물시간에 모르는
여자에게 가서


450
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.186
and say, "Hello. I'd like you to
 take your clothes off and jump on me"?


451
00:15:19.255 --> 00:15:22.156
'안녕, 네 옷을 벗고 나한테
 달려 들어 줄래'라고 말하리?


452
00:15:22.258 --> 00:15:22.310
난 그럴걸

453
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.952
I would.

454
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:24.260
I can see it all now. This is
 gonna be just like last summer.


455
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.286
감 잡았어
작년 여름하고 똑같아 지겠구나


456
00:15:27.364 --> 00:15:27.420
사진관 아가씨에게
반해서는


457
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.355
You fell in love
 with that girl at the Fotomat.


458
00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:29.480
필름만 40달러어치 샀지만
말 한번 못 붙여 봤잖아


459
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.664
You bought $40 worth of fuckin' film,
 and you never even talked to her.


460
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.270
You don't even own a camera!

461
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.669
넌 카메라도 없었잖아!

462
00:15:35.772 --> 00:15:35.800
그럼 어떻게 해?
알면 말해줘


463
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.831
You tell me, Mike.
 What should I do?


464
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:38.408
This is what you do.

465
00:15:38.408 --> 00:15:39.898
이렇게 해봐

466
00:15:40.643 --> 00:15:40.660
생물 시간에
교실에 들어가자 마자


467
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.737
Start from the minute
 you walk into biology.


468
00:15:43.813 --> 00:15:43.930
내말은 그냥 들어가란게 아니고
교실을 가로 질러 들어가고


469
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.681
I mean, don't just walk in.
 Move across the room.


470
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.518
And you don't talk to her.

471
00:15:48.518 --> 00:15:50.349
말을 거는게 아니라

472
00:15:50.487 --> 00:15:50.500
표정이랑 몸짓을 사용해서
표현을 하는거야


473
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.684
You use your face.
 You use your body.


474
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.424
Use everything.

475
00:15:54.424 --> 00:15:55.914
모든걸 사용해

476
00:15:56.359 --> 00:15:56.440
나라면 그렇게 할거야

477
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.690
That's what I do.

478
00:15:57.761 --> 00:15:57.990
내 말은 신호를 보내면...

479
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.161
I mean, I just send out
 this vibe...


480
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.280
그 여자는 반응을 보인다는걸
개인적인 경험으로 알아냈지


481
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.850
and I have personally found
 that women do respond.


482
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.530
I mean, something happens.

483
00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:06.259
뭔가 일어나지

484
00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:06.390
그건 당연한거지

485
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.826
Naturally something happens.

486
00:16:07.904 --> 00:16:08.620
모든 여자들에게 꼬리를 치면
당연히 뭔가가 일어는 나겠지


487
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.465
You put the vibe out to 30 million
 chicks, something is gonna happen.


488
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:11.941
That's the idea, Rat.
 That's the attitude.


489
00:16:11.941 --> 00:16:15.433
바로 그거야
그런 마음가짐이라고


490
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:15.945
- The attitude?
 - Yeah.


491
00:16:15.945 --> 00:16:17.606
마음가짐?

492
00:16:17.714 --> 00:16:17.730
여자가 어떻게 반응을 하던지
신경 안쓸수 있는 마음가짐이 중요해


493
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.241
The attitude dictates
 that you don't care whether
 she comes, stays, lays or prays.


494
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:21.484
Whatever happens,
 your toes are still tappin'.


495
00:16:21.484 --> 00:16:24.282
어떤 일이 벌어져도 넌
태연해질수 있는거지


496
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.188
Now, when you got that...
 then you have the attitude.


497
00:16:25.188 --> 00:16:29.022
네가 그런 경지에 이르면
그런 자세를 가질수 있어


498
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:30.860
- Good night, Stacy.
 - Good night, Mom.


499
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.054
잘 자라, 스테이시

500
00:16:32.128 --> 00:16:33.561
안녕히 주무세요

501
00:16:55.010 --> 00:17:00.450
<i>Just look at that girl with the lights
 coming up in her eyes</i>


502
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.480
<i>She's got to be somebody's baby</i>

503
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.901
<i>She must be somebody's baby</i>

504
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:12.120
예뻐 보인다

505
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.129
- You look beautiful.
 - Thanks. So do you.


506
00:17:13.203 --> 00:17:14.693
고마워요
그 쪽도


507
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:16.773
Where do you feel like going?

508
00:17:16.773 --> 00:17:17.930
어디 갈까?

509
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.062
I don't know.

510
00:17:19.042 --> 00:17:20.200
몰라요

511
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.443
- How 'bout The Point?
 - Okay.


512
00:17:20.443 --> 00:17:21.532
경기장에 갈까?

513
00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:24.445
좋아요

514
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.048
All right!
 The Point it is.


515
00:17:25.048 --> 00:17:28.017
좋았어!
경기장으로 가자!


516
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.270
<i>She's got to be somebody's baby</i>

517
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.470
<i>She's so fine</i>

518
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:38.110
<i>She's probably somebody's only light</i>

519
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.710
<i>Gonna shine tonight</i>

520
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:47.630
<i>Yeah, she's gonna be
 somebody's baby tonight</i>


521
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.430
<i>She's gonna be somebody's only light</i>

522
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.900
<i>Gonna shine tonight</i>

523
00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:02.840
<i>Yeah, she's gonna be
 somebody's baby tonight</i>


524
00:18:15.064 --> 00:18:15.220
정말 멋진 재킷이예요

525
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.294
That's a really nice jacket.

526
00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:17.420
고마워

527
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.029
Thanks.
 Thanks a lot.


528
00:18:25.808 --> 00:18:26.000
따뜻한데

529
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.207
- It's warm.
 - Yeah, it is. It's really warm.


530
00:18:27.277 --> 00:18:29.370
네, 정말 따뜻하네요

531
00:18:29.445 --> 00:18:29.490
얼마나 지속 될 지는 모르지만요

532
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.606
I wonder how long it will last.

533
00:18:35.852 --> 00:18:35.910
그래서...

534
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.046
So...

535
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.789
am I gonna get to first base?

536
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:41.916
1루타는 쳐도 되는거지?

537
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.302
- Are you really 19?
 - Yeah, yeah, I am. I'm really 19.


538
00:18:52.302 --> 00:18:53.460
너 정말 19살이야?

539
00:18:53.903 --> 00:18:56.770
네, 진짜 19살 이예요

540
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:06.200
<i>She's gonna be
 somebody's baby tonight</i>


541
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:12.270
<i>I try to shut my eyes
 but I can't get her out of my sight</i>


542
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:20.020
<i>I know I'm gonna know it
 but I gotta get over my fright</i>


543
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.980
<i>I'm just gonna walk up to her</i>

544
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.000
<i>I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>

545
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:43.440
<i>Gonna shine tonight
 Make her mine tonight?</i>


546
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.570
<i>Yeah</i>

547
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.180
<i>Gonna shine tonight
 Make her mine tonight</i>


548
00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:53.590
론이 좋아?

549
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.760
So tell me, do you like Ron?

550
00:19:55.832 --> 00:19:56.020
론은 좋은데 정말 아팠어

551
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.131
I like Ron, but it hurt so bad.

552
00:19:59.202 --> 00:19:59.360
걱정 말고 계속 하면
점점 괜찮아 질거야


553
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.000
Don't worry. Keep doing it.
 It gets a lot better. I swear.


554
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:02.090
그래야지

555
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.504
It better.

556
00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.530
<i>Raised on the radio</i>

557
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.560
<i>Just an all
-American boy</i>

558
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.670
<i>I got my favorite toy</i>

<i>I was

560
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.540
<i>Yeah, I was raised on the radio</i>

- Mom says to clean the pool.
 - Why can't you do it?


564
00:20:30.466 --> 00:20:32.024
엄마가 수영장 청소
해놓으라 신다


565
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:33.261
오빠가 할 순 없었어??

566
00:20:33.336 --> 00:20:33.350
네 친구들이 쓰고
엉망으로 해놓은 거야


567
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.770
Your friends use the pool.
 Your friends messed it up.


568
00:20:35.938 --> 00:20:36.000
오빠 친구들도 쓰잖아

569
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.769
- Your friends use the pool too.
 - I take out the garbage!


570
00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:40.108
난 쓰레기는 치워!

571
00:20:47.617 --> 00:20:50.051
네 첫경험을 기억하며, 론 존슨

572
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:53.923
Brad!

573
00:20:53.923 --> 00:20:54.912
오빠!

574
00:20:57.627 --> 00:20:57.790
엄마랑 아빠가
이거 보셨어?


575
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.959
- Brad, have Mom and Dad seen these?
 - They're not home yet.


576
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:01.553
아직 안 오셨어

577
00:21:02.332 --> 00:21:02.590
오빠?

578
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.390
- Brad?
 - What?


579
00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:04.660
왜?

580
00:21:05.268 --> 00:21:05.350
만약에 내가 이걸...

581
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.997
What would you say if
 I asked you to put these...


582
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.400
오빠차 트렁크에 숨겼다가
버려 달라고 부탁해도 돼?


583
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.301
in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel
 and get rid of them?


584
00:21:10.373 --> 00:21:10.430
'누가 론 존슨이냐? '라고 묻겠지

585
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.432
- I'd say, "Who the hell is Ron Johnson?"
 - Please.


586
00:21:12.508 --> 00:21:13.600
제발...

587
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:16.040
정말 고마워

588
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.340
Thank you very much.

589
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:19.916
- Lisa's great!
 - Yeah.


590
00:21:19.916 --> 00:21:21.679
리사는 괜찮은 여자야!

591
00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:22.900
왜 그런 애랑 헤어지려는지
이해를 못하겠어


592
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.811
I don't understand why you want
 to break up with a girl like that.


593
00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:27.857
Me and Lisa have been going together
 for two years. I love her and all.


594
00:21:27.857 --> 00:21:31.953
나랑 리사는 2년을 사귀었어
사랑은 해


595
00:21:32.061 --> 00:21:32.120
잠자리도 끝내준다고

596
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.052
I mean, she's great in bed.

597
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:35.865
It's just that...
 I'm a single, successful guy.


598
00:21:35.865 --> 00:21:39.560
하지만 그저...
난 성공한 총각이고


599
00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:42.000
올해가 학교에서의 마지막 해고
인생 최고의 해가 될수도 있어!


600
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.399
And this is my last year in school.
 This could be the best year of my life!


601
00:21:47.944 --> 00:21:47.970
그저 지금은 나만의
자유를 원할뿐이야, 알아?


602
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.777
I just feel like I need
 my freedom now, you know?


603
00:21:54.617 --> 00:21:54.740
좋아, 여기 네 준비물들이야

604
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.881
Okay, here's your preparation stuff.

605
00:21:56.953 --> 00:21:57.140
잘라놓은 토마토는 여기 있고
양배추랑 비밀 소스는 여기 있어


606
00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.151
You got your sliced tomatoes,
 shredded lettuce, secret sauce.


607
00:22:01.224 --> 00:22:01.380
비밀 소스가 뭔데?

608
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.452
- What's the secret sauce?
 - Thousand Island dressing.


609
00:22:02.525 --> 00:22:04.049
샐러드 드레싱

610
00:22:04.127 --> 00:22:04.210
브론코 햄버거 숍의
비밀 소스는 뭐야?


611
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.618
What's the secret sauce
 at Bronco Burger?


612
00:22:06.696 --> 00:22:06.780
- 케첩이랑 마요네즈
- 그렇구나


613
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.164
- Ketchup and mayonnaise.
 - Gotcha.


614
00:22:09.232 --> 00:22:09.550
주문 들어왔어

615
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.597
Order for you, Bradley.

616
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:13.603
- Were those flowers really for me?
 - Of course!


617
00:22:13.603 --> 00:22:15.093
저 꽃들 정말
날 위한거야?


618
00:22:15.405 --> 00:22:16.429
당연하지!

619
00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:16.630
얼마나 들었는데?

620
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.766
- How much did they cost?
 - Don't worry about it.


621
00:22:18.307 --> 00:22:19.774
걱정하지 마

622
00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:20.443
Want to go to The Point tonight?

623
00:22:20.443 --> 00:22:21.740
오늘 밤에 경기장에 갈까?

624
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.579
What's there to do at The Point?

625
00:22:23.579 --> 00:22:24.910
거긴 가서 뭐하게?

626
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:25.581
What do you mean? We've been
 going out together for two years.


627
00:22:25.581 --> 00:22:29.483
무슨 뜻이야? 우린 2년동안
사귀었었어


628
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.219
I don't want to have to use sex
 as a tool, Brad.


629
00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:33.484
섹스의 도구로
사용되고 싶지는 않아


630
00:22:33.823 --> 00:22:33.840
도구? 무슨 도구?
우린 2년을 사귀었어!


631
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.850
Tool? Tool for what?
 We've been going together for two years!


632
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.351
- I don't want to talk about it here.
 - I wanna talk about it!


633
00:22:38.428 --> 00:22:39.861
여기서 말하기 싫어

634
00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:41.055
난 여기서 말하고 싶어!

635
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.290
브래드?

636
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:41.889
- Brad?
 - Lisa!


637
00:22:42.498 --> 00:22:43.430
리사!

638
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:43.666
Brad!

639
00:22:43.666 --> 00:22:44.360
브래드!

640
00:22:46.002 --> 00:22:46.060
뒤집어야지 안그러면
다 타버려


641
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.163
You gotta flip 'em, or they'll burn.
 Great.


642
00:22:50.206 --> 00:22:50.300
'C'

643
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.195
"C."

644
00:22:51.774 --> 00:22:51.860
'D'

645
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.934
"D."

646
00:22:54.143 --> 00:22:54.200
'F'

647
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.303
"F."

648
00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:56.860
'F' 자네도 'F'

649
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.215
"F." "F."

650
00:23:00.316 --> 00:23:00.400
지난 3주간 플랫 개정 헌법에
대하여 공부했습니다


651
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.649
Three weeks we've been talking
 about the Platt Amendment.


652
00:23:03.719 --> 00:23:03.770
그렇게 이해가 안가던가요?

653
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.654
What are you people, on dope?

654
00:23:07.089 --> 00:23:07.140
이 사항은 존 플랫 의원에 의해
국회에 소개 되었고


655
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.890
A piece of legislation was introduced
 into Congress by Senator John Platt.


656
00:23:11.961 --> 00:23:12.080
1906년에 승인되었습니다

657
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.089
It was passed in 1906.

658
00:23:15.331 --> 00:23:15.420
이 법안의 우리나라
헌법 설립에...


659
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.595
This amendment to our Constitution...

660
00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:17.750
기반을 잡아준...

661
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.158
has a profound impact
 upon all of our...


662
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.937
Where is Jeff Spicoli? I saw him earlier
 today near the first floor bathrooms.


663
00:23:20.937 --> 00:23:22.268
스피콜리군은 어디 있나요?

664
00:23:22.338 --> 00:23:24.829
1층 화장실 근처에서
아까 봤는데


665
00:23:24.907 --> 00:23:24.970
아직도 학교 안에 있나요?
아는 사람? 네, 데스몬드군?


666
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.638
Is he still on campus?
 Anyone? Yes, Desmond?


667
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:29.745
I saw him by the food machines.

668
00:23:29.745 --> 00:23:31.303
자판기 옆에서 봤어요

669
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:31.781
- How long ago?
 - Right before class.


670
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:34.045
- 얼마전에 봤나요?
- 수업시작 직전에요


671
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:34.350
Okay.
 Bring him in.


672
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.318
가서 데려 오세요

673
00:23:37.487 --> 00:23:37.650
수업을 빠지는게
무슨 매력이 있단는거죠?


674
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.479
What is this fascination with truancy?

675
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:40.770
머리속에 무슨 생각들을
하는 겁니까?


676
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.182
What is it that gets inside your heads?

677
00:23:44.627 --> 00:23:44.680
이 학교내의 몇몇 선생님들은
못 본척 넘겨주기도 하지만


678
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.563
There are some teachers in this school
 who look the other way at truants.


679
00:23:48.631 --> 00:23:48.660
학생과 선생의
장난질일 뿐이예요


680
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.565
It's a little game
 that you both play.


681
00:23:50.633 --> 00:23:50.680
선생들은 학생이 수업빠지는걸
못 본척 해주고 학생들도 마찬가지고


682
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.500
They pretend they don't see you.
 You pretend you don't ditch.


683
00:23:53.569 --> 00:23:53.660
나중에 누가 피해를 보죠?
제군들입니다!


684
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.663
Now, who pays the price later?
 You!


685
00:23:59.942 --> 00:24:00.100
이거 뭐야?
내 생일파티 안하잖아!


686
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.730
Wait a minute.
 There's no birthday party for me here!


687
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.048
Hola, Mr. Hand.

688
00:24:06.048 --> 00:24:07.106
안녕하세요, 선생님

689
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:07.817
What's the reason for your truancy?

690
00:24:07.817 --> 00:24:09.648
수업을 빠진
이유가 뭡니까?


691
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.686
Just couldn't make it on time.

692
00:24:10.686 --> 00:24:11.948
제 시간에
못 온것 뿐이예요


693
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:12.989
You mean,
 you couldn't or you wouldn't?


694
00:24:12.989 --> 00:24:14.650
못 온건가요 아님
안 온건가요?


695
00:24:16.659 --> 00:24:16.890
음식들이 너무 많이
보였었어요


696
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.423
It was like a full crowd scene
 at the food lines.


697
00:24:19.495 --> 00:24:19.520
음식은 개인적인 시간에
먹도록 해요


698
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.225
Food will be eaten on your time.

699
00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:22.650
왜 계속해서 이 수업에
늦게 오는건가요, 스피콜리군?


700
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.126
Why are you continuously late
 for this class, Mr. Spicoli?


701
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:26.769
Why do you shamelessly waste
 my time like this?


702
00:24:26.769 --> 00:24:30.671
왜 이렇게 부끄럽게 제 시간을
허비 시키는 거죠?


703
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:33.843
- I don't know.
 -


704
00:24:33.843 --> 00:24:35.140
모르겠어요

705
00:24:55.398 --> 00:24:55.560
맘에 드는군요

706
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.763
I like that.

707
00:24:57.761 --> 00:24:57.867
"I don't know."
 That's nice!


708
00:24:57.867 --> 00:24:59.892
모르겠어요

709
00:24:59.969 --> 00:25:00.760
좋군요!

710
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.459
"Mr. Hand,
 will I pass this class?"


711
00:25:01.537 --> 00:25:02.990
선생님, 제가 이 반에서
낙제 하지 않을까요?


712
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.732
"Gee, Mr. Spicoli,
 I don't know!"


713
00:25:03.806 --> 00:25:06.798
이런, 스피콜리군
나도 잘 모르겠어요!


714
00:25:06.976 --> 00:25:07.000
좋아요, 맘에 들어요
내가 어떻게 할지 알아요?


715
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.467
That's nice. I really like that.
 You know what I'm gonna do?


716
00:25:09.612 --> 00:25:09.670
이 말을 칠판에 계속 적어 둘테니
보면서 즐기도록 해요


717
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.571
I'm going to leave your words on this
 board for all my classes to enjoy.


718
00:25:13.649 --> 00:25:13.710
물론 이 반을 통과를
시켜주죠, 스피콜리군!


719
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.180
Giving you full credit,
 of course, Mr. Spicoli!


720
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:16.914
All right.

721
00:25:16.986 --> 00:25:17.884
좋죠

722
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.890
<i>Sleigh bells ring
 are you listening</i>


723
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.201
- Mommy!
 - <i>In the lane</i>


724
00:25:32.201 --> 00:25:33.532
엄마!

725
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.800
이런

726
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.202
- Oh, no!
 - <i>Snow is glistening</i>


727
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.960
<i>A beautiful sight
 We're happy tonight</i>


728
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.230
<i>Walking in a winter wonderland</i>

729
00:25:43.379 --> 00:25:43.470
얼마나 더 기다려야 해?

730
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.347
How fucking long
 do I have to wait?


731
00:25:47.249 --> 00:25:47.410
크리스마스인데 정말 싫다

732
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.581
Christmas sucks.
 I hate it.


733
00:25:49.652 --> 00:25:49.740
사람들이 늘 소릴 질러도
휴일에도 일하는데 익숙해 져야 돼


734
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.610
You gotta get used to working holidays.
 People are always screaming.


735
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.110
I have to quit this job.
 I'm gonna get so fat...


736
00:25:53.189 --> 00:25:54.349
나 일 관둘거야

737
00:25:54.423 --> 00:25:54.910
여기 있다간 살이 너무 쪄서
아무도 날 안데려 갈거야


738
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.018
- no one's gonna want to take me out.
 - Ron hasn't called, huh?


739
00:25:58.094 --> 00:25:59.721
론한테 전화 안왔구나?

740
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.129
- Not since November.
 - What does it matter?
 He's a stereo salesman.


741
00:26:00.129 --> 00:26:01.426
11월 이후엔 한번도...

742
00:26:01.797 --> 00:26:04.493
도대체 왜 그래?
걘 겨우 전파상 세일즈맨이야


743
00:26:04.567 --> 00:26:04.650
어쩌려고? 론이랑 결혼해서
애 낳고 살래?


744
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.365
What'd you wanna do, marry him?
 Have kids with him?


745
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.490
나중에 머리 다 빠진
아저씨랑 살고 싶어?


746
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.701
Have this guy come home
 50 years old and bald?


747
00:26:10.806 --> 00:26:10.830
미래도 없어 보이는 사람이랑?
정신차려, 스테이시


748
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.333
And have that little Pacific Stereo
 sign on? Come on, Stace.


749
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:14.543
Hey, it's his loss.

750
00:26:14.543 --> 00:26:16.272
그 사람이 복을
차 버린거야


751
00:26:17.713 --> 00:26:17.870
블루 오이스터 컬트
티켓 있어요?


752
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.374
Got any Blue Oyster Cult?

753
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.216
No, I don't have any
 Blue Oyster Cult.


754
00:26:20.216 --> 00:26:22.878
아니, 없어

755
00:26:22.952 --> 00:26:23.030
지난 번에 34장이나 손해 봤는데
어디 있었냐?


756
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.615
I ate 34 pairs last time.
 Where were you?


757
00:26:26.722 --> 00:26:26.770
하마터면 편의점에서
일할뻔 했잖아, 알어?


758
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.020
I was that close to working
 at 7-Eleven, you know.


759
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.327
What?

760
00:26:31.327 --> 00:26:32.487
뭐?

761
00:26:35.464 --> 00:26:35.560
- 좋아, 한판 할까?
- 당근이지


762
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.262
- All right! Play me?
 - Totally.


763
00:26:38.334 --> 00:26:38.420
동전 있어?

764
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.801
You got quarters?

765
00:26:44.173 --> 00:26:44.330
대지, 바람, 불의 티켓이
언제 들어오냐?


766
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.505
When are those Earth, Wind and Fire
 tickets comin' in?


767
00:26:46.575 --> 00:26:46.770
대지, 바람, 불?
아직 들은바 없는데


768
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.930
Earth, Wind and Fire?
 Geez, I haven't heard anything.


769
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.238
The minute I do,
 I'll let you know.


770
00:26:50.312 --> 00:26:52.000
콘서트 소식 들으면
바로 알려줄게


771
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.303
I'm plannin' on taking
 my little brother over here.


772
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:54.440
저기 있는 내 동생을
데려갈 계획이야


773
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:54.850
Is that your little brother?
 He's a good-lookin' kid.


774
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:58.217
저게 네 동생이야?
잘 생겼네


775
00:26:58.354 --> 00:26:58.410
알았어, 찰스 제퍼슨이랑...

776
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.380
Great.
 Charles Jefferson...


777
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.084
for Earth, Wind and Fire
 and little brother.


778
00:27:01.157 --> 00:27:03.648
동생이 대지, 바람, 불의
티켓을 원함


779
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.360
I'll let you know when
 they come around, okay?


780
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.794
여기서 콘서트 하면
바로 알려줄게


781
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.290
와! 저 형 이 동네 살았어요?
경기날만 날아오는줄 알았어요


782
00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.796
Wow! Does he really live here?
 I thought he just flew in for games.


783
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:15.320
티켓을 어디로 구하러
와야하는질 잘 알잖아


784
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.964
Shit! He knows where to come
 when he wants some tickets.


785
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.130
저리가
내 장사에 방해 되잖아


786
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.441
Go on. Get outta here.
 You're messing up my business.


787
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:21.777
Come on, Rat.
 Let's go get you a woman.


788
00:27:21.777 --> 00:27:24.405
마크, 네 여자나
보러 가자


789
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.570
Wow.

790
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.216
You ready for
 your moment of truth?


791
00:27:27.216 --> 00:27:28.649
운명의 시간
준비됐어?


792
00:27:28.718 --> 00:27:28.770
마이크, 오늘 아침에
여드름이 하나 생겼걸랑...


793
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.610
Damone, I noticed I was starting
 to get a pimple this morning...


794
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.313
Rat, the shyness routine
 is really starting to aggravate me.


795
00:27:32.388 --> 00:27:35.789
네 그 쑥맥 정신에 이젠
짜증나기 시작한다


796
00:27:35.858 --> 00:27:36.010
도대체 어떤 여자길래 그래?
그저 피자가게 종업원이라고


797
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.056
I mean, who is she, anyway?
 She's a waitress in a pizza parlor.


798
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:40.396
Look at her. Look at you.
 A member of the Honor Roll.


799
00:27:40.396 --> 00:27:44.457
쟬 봐봐, 그리고 넣 봐
넌 모범생 킹카에


800
00:27:44.533 --> 00:27:44.660
극장 부 지점장의
비서실장이라고


801
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.730
Assistant to the assistant manager
 of the movie theater.


802
00:27:47.803 --> 00:27:47.890
만약 저 여자가
네 가치를 모른다면


803
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.603
Rat, if this girl
 can't smell your qualifications,
 then who needs her, right?


804
00:27:51.674 --> 00:27:52.971
저 여자 손해지 않아?

805
00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:53.100
- 맞아
- 좋아, 기분 어때?


806
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.101
- Right.
 - All right. How do you feel?


807
00:27:55.177 --> 00:27:55.260
- 좋아
- 정말? 좋았어


808
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.111
- I feel good.
 - Do ya? All right.


809
00:27:57.179 --> 00:27:57.300
이제 바보짓은 그만하고
가서 꼬셔봐


810
00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.739
Now stop fucking around
 and go get her.


811
00:28:00.382 --> 00:28:00.440
마크, 그 웃옷은 벗어야지

812
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.930
Hey, Rat, you gotta ace that jacket.

813
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.876
- Yeah?
 - Yeah. All right, that's cool.


814
00:28:05.287 --> 00:28:06.450
좋아, 괜찮아 보이네

815
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.414
You look good. All right?
 Go get her.


816
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.685
알았어? 가 봐

817
00:28:15.097 --> 00:28:15.290
1달러 10센트고
거스름돈은 5센트요


818
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.589
$1.10, and you get five cents back.

819
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.602
Thanks.

820
00:28:19.602 --> 00:28:20.626
고마워요

821
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.003
- Hi! Don't I know you
 from biology class?
 - Yeah!


822
00:28:21.003 --> 00:28:23.733
우리 같은 생물시간
듣지 않니?


823
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.874
- What can I do for you?
 - I had a couple of questions.
 I was curious.


824
00:28:24.874 --> 00:28:25.772
뭐 줄까?

825
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:29.537
질문이 두개 있는데...

826
00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.212
What do you do with the
 jackets people leave here?


827
00:28:30.212 --> 00:28:32.476
사람들이 놓고간 재킷들을
어떻게 처리해?


828
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:32.681
- We keep 'em.
 - You keep 'em?


829
00:28:32.681 --> 00:28:33.705
보관 해 두지

830
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.710
보관해?

831
00:28:35.818 --> 00:28:35.870
찾으러 올 경우를 대비하지
원하면 한번 찾아봐


832
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.310
In case they come back.
 You can look through it if you want.


833
00:28:39.388 --> 00:28:39.440
괜찮아, 그걸 전부 보려면
너무 오래 걸릴것 같아


834
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.810
No, that's cool. It would take
 too long to look through all that.


835
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.154
I'll pick up a new one.

836
00:28:43.225 --> 00:28:44.954
새 걸 하나 살래

837
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.530
What was your other question?

838
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:48.758
또 다른 질문은 뭐야?

839
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.298
Oh, my other question is...

840
00:28:49.298 --> 00:28:51.892
내 다른 질문은...

841
00:28:53.702 --> 00:28:53.760
가끔 연락하게
네 전화번호 줄래?


842
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.899
can I have your phone number
 so I can ask you out sometime?


843
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:57.606
- Do you have a pen?
 This one's out of ink.
 - Yeah.


844
00:28:57.606 --> 00:28:59.005
펜 있어?
이건 잉크가 없어서


845
00:29:12.188 --> 00:29:12.310
만나서 반가웠어, 스테이시
난 마크 래트너야


846
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.215
Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy.
 My name is Mark Ratner.


847
00:29:18.127 --> 00:29:18.320
이제 가야 해

848
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.459
I've gotta go.

849
00:29:33.542 --> 00:29:35.703
아가씨, 한번 하자

850
00:29:37.112 --> 00:29:37.270
리사, 할 말이 있어

851
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.070
Lisa, I have something to tell you.

852
00:29:41.483 --> 00:29:41.640
이제 우린 고(高)3 이잖아

853
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.941
Look, I'm a senior now.

854
00:29:45.554 --> 00:29:45.600
난 성공한 싱글이고

855
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.920
I'm a single, successful guy.

856
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:49.892
And I've got to be fair to myself.

857
00:29:49.892 --> 00:29:51.689
나 자신에게 충실해 줘야 해

858
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:51.820
난 자유가 필요한 것 같아

859
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.060
Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

860
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.930
그러지 마

861
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:02.896
Oh, don't do that.

862
00:30:03.005 --> 00:30:03.090
제발, 이러지 마

863
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.200
- Please, please don't do that.
 - Brad!


864
00:30:05.274 --> 00:30:05.330
2번 창구 대신 잠깐만 봐줄래?

865
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.538
- Can you cover me on register two?
 - Okay.


866
00:30:07.843 --> 00:30:09.276
알았어

867
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:13.182
- May I help you?
 - Ah, yes.


868
00:30:13.182 --> 00:30:15.013
- 도와 드려요?
- 그래


869
00:30:15.117 --> 00:30:15.170
아침치곤 너무 엉망이야
내 돈을 돌려 줘


870
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.580
This is not the best breakfast
 I ever ate and...


871
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.746
- I'd like my money back.
 - Okay. I believe
 you have to fill out a form.


872
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:21.670
네, 서류를 꾸며주셔야
하는걸로 아는데...


873
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.154
No. I'd like my money back now.

874
00:30:22.224 --> 00:30:24.351
아니, 난 당장 환불을 바래

875
00:30:24.426 --> 00:30:24.910
죄송하지만 그렇게는 안돼고
서류를 꾸며주셔야 해요


876
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.260
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way.
 I have to fill out a form.


877
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.564
Well, you ate most of it
 already so...


878
00:30:28.564 --> 00:30:30.589
이미 거의 다 드셨고...

879
00:30:30.666 --> 00:30:30.920
저기 표지 보이나?

880
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.931
See that sign?
 It says "100% guaranteed."


881
00:30:34.103 --> 00:30:34.130
'만족'이란 단어의 뜻 몰라?
여기서 그런거 안가르치나?


882
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.697
You know what the meaning
 of guarantee is?
 Did they teach you that here?


883
00:30:36.872 --> 00:30:36.930
선생님, 잠깐만 시간을
주신다면...


884
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.067
Sir, if you'd just wait a minute.

885
00:30:39.575 --> 00:30:39.590
이봐, 금전통 안에
잔말말고 손을 넣고


886
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.600
Look. Just put your little hand
 in the cash register...


887
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:42.738
and give me my $2.75 back,
 please, Brad.


888
00:30:42.811 --> 00:30:46.542
내 2달러 75센트를 돌려줘
브래드


889
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:46.782
Sir, if you'd just give me a minute.
 I'll find the forms.
 I'll take care of everything.


890
00:30:46.782 --> 00:30:51.082
잠깐만 시간을 주시면 서류를 찾아
모든걸 해결해 드리겠습니다


891
00:30:51.153 --> 00:30:51.270
난 그 잠깐도 시간이 없어
이미 날 늦게 만들었어


892
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.088
I don't have a minute.
 You've made me late enough.


893
00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:54.320
불만족함을 참는데도
이젠 지쳤어


894
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.952
I am so tired of dealing
 with incompetence.


895
00:30:57.026 --> 00:30:57.180
100% 만족 보장이라잖아
이 멍청한 자식아!


896
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.086
It says 100% guaranteed,
 you moron!


897
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:00.663
Mister, if you don't shut up,
 I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.


898
00:31:00.663 --> 00:31:03.723
아저씨, 당장 닥치지 않으면

899
00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.401
Ah, is there a problem here?
 Can I help you, sir?


900
00:31:05.401 --> 00:31:07.995
문제가 있나?
도와 드릴까요, 선생님?


901
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:08.337
You bet you have a problem.
 Your employee used profanity
 and threatened me with violence.


902
00:31:08.337 --> 00:31:10.168
정말 문제가 많소

903
00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:13.140
자네 부하직원이 욕설과
폭력으로 날 협박했소


904
00:31:13.242 --> 00:31:13.290
매일 여기서 식사를 하고 서비스가
좋았는데, 기가 막히군요


905
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.904
I'm surprised. I eat here all the time
 and usually have good service.


906
00:31:16.011 --> 00:31:16.100
내가 바란건 오직 여기 덜 구워진
아침 식사에 대한 환불이었는데


907
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:21.005
All I wanted was my money back on this
 breakfast. It was a little under-cooked.


908
00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:21.160
이 자가 폭력을 쓰며 날 협박했어요
이곳 지점장을 불러서...


909
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.881
And he threatens me with violence.
 I'm gonna call your super...


910
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:24.954
I can take care of it.

911
00:31:24.954 --> 00:31:26.581
제가 도와드리죠

912
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.380
해밀튼군, 손님께 협박을 하거나
욕설을 사용했나?


913
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.692
Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this
 customer or use profanity in any way?


914
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.730
Uh... he insulted me first.
 He called me a moron, Dennis.


915
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.097
먼저 욕을 했어요
저보고 멍청한 놈이라고 했어요


916
00:31:38.267 --> 00:31:38.290
대답만 해! 손님께 협박을 하거나
욕설을 사용했나?


917
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.759
Answer me! Did you threaten
 this customer or use profanity?


918
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:42.638
- Yes.
 - You're fired.


919
00:31:42.638 --> 00:31:44.469
- 네
- 자넨 해고야


920
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.274
I'm very sorry, sir.
 I'll refund your money right now.


921
00:31:45.274 --> 00:31:48.300
대단히 죄송합니다, 손님
당장 돈은 환불 해드리겠습니다


922
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:48.844
I hope you won't hold this against us.

923
00:31:48.844 --> 00:31:50.311
감정은 없으셨길 바랍니다

924
00:31:50.412 --> 00:31:50.500
요즘 젊은것들은
버릇이 없어 문제예요


925
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.744
You know how these young kids are
 these days.


926
00:31:53.015 --> 00:31:53.270
여기 있습니다
다른것으로 드시겠습니까?


927
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.483
Here we are.
 Perhaps another breakfast?


928
00:31:55.684 --> 00:31:55.780
오줌싸다 빠져 죽었냐, 자식아!

929
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.482
I hope you had
 a hell of a piss, Arnold!


930
00:32:05.894 --> 00:32:06.050
1946년 이후 이 해변을
 강타한 최대의 파도를 이긴


931
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.990
The world's finest
 surfers showed up today to do battle...


932
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.330
with what's turned out to be the biggest
 waves to hit this coast since 1946.


933
00:32:09.398 --> 00:32:13.459
세계 최고의 서퍼가
탄생 했습니다


934
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.690
안녕하세요, 스투 나한입니다
 그 주인공인 제프 스피콜리를


935
00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.130
Hello. I'm Stu Nahan,
 and I'd like you to meet this young man.


936
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.638
His name, Jeff Spicoli.
 Jeff, congratulations.


937
00:32:16.705 --> 00:32:20.038
소개 합니다
축하해요, 제프군


938
00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:20.309
Things looked rough out there today.

939
00:32:20.309 --> 00:32:22.573
오늘 상황이 많이
힘들어 보이던데요...


940
00:32:22.644 --> 00:32:22.790
정말 커다란 파도랑
전쟁을 벌였지만


941
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.273
I'll tell you, Stu,
 I did battle with some humongous waves.


942
00:32:26.348 --> 00:32:26.400
ABC방송국 기자에게 말했듯이
 '위험해도 이건 제 임무죠'


943
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:31.251
Just like I told the guy on ABC,
 "Danger is my business."


944
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:31.410
많은 사람들이 마크 데이비스나
봅 제랄드가


945
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.483
A lot of people
 expected Mark "Cutback" Davis,
 or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard...


946
00:32:34.556 --> 00:32:36.440
올해 우승을 차지할거라고
예상을 했었죠


947
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.389
- would take the honors this year.
 - Those guys are fags!


948
00:32:37.459 --> 00:32:39.017
그 사람들은 엉터리예요!

949
00:32:39.094 --> 00:32:40.040
좋습니다

950
00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:40.527
Let me ask you. When you get out there,
 do you ever fear for your life?


951
00:32:40.596 --> 00:32:43.724
하나만 묻죠, 바다에 나갔을때
 목숨을 잃을까 겁나지 않았었나요?


952
00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:43.890
서핑은 스포츠도 아니고
 취미도 아닌 인생 그 자체예요


953
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.429
Stu, surfing's not a sport.
 It's a way of life. It's no hobby.


954
00:32:48.504 --> 00:32:48.550
그렇게 생각을 하고 나가면
파도가...


955
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.870
It's a way of looking at that wave
 and saying, "Hey, bud, let's party!"


956
00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:53.360
'이봐, 친구, 파티를 시작하자고!'
 라고 말하죠


957
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:54.243
Where'd you get this jacket?

958
00:32:54.243 --> 00:32:55.574
그 양복 어디서 났어요?

959
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:55.778
From the network. Let me ask you,
 what's next for Jeff Spicoli?


960
00:32:55.778 --> 00:32:59.509
방송국에서 받았어요
다음 계획은 뭔가요?


961
00:32:59.681 --> 00:32:59.740
일단 호주에서 대회를 치룬 후
 하와이 대회를 나갈 겁니다


962
00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.549
Headed over to the Australian
 and then the Hawaiian Internationals.


963
00:33:03.619 --> 00:33:03.730
그 다음엔 런던으로 날아가서
 롤링 스톤즈랑 연주 같이 해야죠


964
00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:08.110
Then me and Mick are gonna wing on over
 to London and jam with the Stones.


965
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:09.080
You guys are invited too.

966
00:33:09.491 --> 00:33:11.584
너희들도 초대할게 가자

967
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.820
Jeff! Jeff!

968
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.732
Jeff, Dad says you have to get up.

969
00:33:16.732 --> 00:33:18.090
- 아빠가 형 이제 일어나래
- 냅둬


970
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.360
- Leave me alone.
 - Dad says you're gonna be late again,
 you butthole!


971
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:21.828
빨리 안 일어나면 또 늦는대
이 잠꾸러기야!


972
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:22.271
- Leave me alone!
 - Dad says you're gonna be late again,
 you booger!


973
00:33:22.271 --> 00:33:23.465
냅두라니깐!

974
00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:25.698
아빠가 빨리 안 일어나면 또
늦는대, 이 밥통아!


975
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.475
Dad, Jeff threw his snorkel at me!

976
00:33:26.475 --> 00:33:29.171
아빠, 형이 잠수장비를 나한테
던졌어요!


977
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:31.780
We just want to say that
 we're not Spirit Bunnies anymore.


978
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.045
우린 더 이상 남자들의 노리개가
아니라는걸 말하고 싶었어


979
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:35.551
We always hated that name.
 It bugged the heck out of Dina and me.


980
00:33:35.551 --> 00:33:39.009
그 말이 젤 듣기 싫지
정말 짜증 나는 단어였어


981
00:33:39.088 --> 00:33:39.210
- 정말 저질적인 말이야!
- 정말 그래!


982
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.682
- It's just such a put-down!
 - Really!


983
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.458
We know you've got a lot of spirit,
 everybody, right?


984
00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:45.950
모두 학교 사랑하는 마음이
엄청난거 맞지?


985
00:33:46.061 --> 00:33:46.110
다음주에 링컨 고등학교를
묵사발을 만들어 줄거야!


986
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.360
And we're gonna destroy Lincoln
 next week! All right!


987
00:33:53.235 --> 00:33:53.260
여기 앞에 나와서 뻔히 알면서도
사람들이 놀릴 짓을 하려면


988
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.630
You know, it takes a lot
 of courage to get up here...


989
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:56.772
and do something that
 you know people will make fun of.


990
00:33:56.772 --> 00:33:59.206
정말 많은
용기가 필요해


991
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.676
- Yeah.
 - Man...


992
00:34:00.676 --> 00:34:01.836
젠장...

993
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:02.630
그 자식들이랑 두번 다시
말도 안 할거야


994
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.036
I'm never gonna talk
 to those guys again.


995
00:34:05.414 --> 00:34:05.470
아놀드랑 데이브 취직을
시켜준건 나였어


996
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.872
I'm the one who got Arnold and Dave
 their jobs there in the first place.


997
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:09.430
가서 사과만 하면
다시 일 시켜 줄거야


998
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.485
If you'd apologize to Dennis,
 I'm sure he'd take you back.


999
00:34:12.254 --> 00:34:12.410
됐다고 봐!
내가 뭘 잘못해서 사과를 해!


1000
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.712
Fuck Dennis Taylor!
 I'm not gonna apologize to that wimp.


1001
00:34:19.194 --> 00:34:19.320
그저 우리가 아직도
사귀고 있어서 다행이야


1002
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.424
I'm just glad
 we're still together...


1003
00:34:21.497 --> 00:34:21.650
많은 일이 벌어졌고
올해 네가 정말 옆에 있어주길 바래


1004
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.057
because a lot's happened,
 and I really need you this year.


1005
00:34:26.068 --> 00:34:26.130
브래드, 어떻게 이 말을 해야 하나
참 많이 망설였었걸랑...


1006
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:30.560
Look, Brad, I've been trying
 to think of a way to tell you this.


1007
00:34:32.174 --> 00:34:32.330
졸업도 얼마 안 남았어

1008
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:33.835
We're almost out of school.
 It's our last year.


1009
00:34:34.276 --> 00:34:36.107
올해가 마지막이잖아

1010
00:34:36.278 --> 00:34:36.340
우리 스스로에게 자유가
필요할거라고 생각해


1011
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.738
And I think we owe it
 to ourselves to be free,


1012
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.617
to go out with other people.

1013
00:34:41.617 --> 00:34:43.847
다른 사람들도
사귀어 봐야지


1014
00:34:46.655 --> 00:34:46.810
물론 계속 친구론 남을거야

1015
00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.748
I still want to be friends.

1016
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:49.858
What do I say to her
 once we get in the car?


1017
00:34:49.858 --> 00:34:52.588
차에 탄 다음에
무슨 말을 해야 해?


1018
00:34:52.694 --> 00:34:52.740
걱정마, 내 5가지
특수 연예 비법이면 돼


1019
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.926
No problem, Rat. What you need
 is my special five-point plan.


1020
00:34:56.999 --> 00:34:57.120
장난 하지 마
나 정말 도움이 필요해


1021
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.194
Come on, Damone, 
I need real help.

1022
00:34:59.268 --> 00:34:59.350
무슨 뜻이야?
내 이 비법을 얻으려고


1023
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.420
What'd you mean?
 Men have died...


1024
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:01.537
trying to obtain this
 valuable information.


1025
00:35:01.537 --> 00:35:04.665
얼마나 많은 사람들이
죽어간지 알아?


1026
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:04.873
- But I'll give it to you for free.
 - What's your five-point plan?


1027
00:35:04.873 --> 00:35:06.272
하지만 넌 공짜로 알려주지

1028
00:35:06.341 --> 00:35:06.730
네 5가지 비법이 뭔데?

1029
00:35:09.645 --> 00:35:09.740
좋아, 잘 들어

1030
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.200
All right.
 Now, pay attention.


1031
00:35:14.483 --> 00:35:14.680
첫째로 네가 얼마나 좋아하는지를
여자가 모르게 해


1032
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.977
First of all, you never let on
 how much you like a girl.


1033
00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:19.721
Oh, Debbie... hi.

1034
00:35:19.721 --> 00:35:22.310
데비구나...
안녕...


1035
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.725
Two.
 You always call the shots.


1036
00:35:23.725 --> 00:35:26.523
둘째, 항상 네가 먼저 이끌어

1037
00:35:26.728 --> 00:35:26.750
키스하자, 후회하지 않을거야

1038
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.128
Kiss me, you won't regret it.

1039
00:35:30.432 --> 00:35:30.450
셋째, 어디 있던지 간에 그 곳을
있고 싶은 장소로 만들어 줘


1040
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.801
Three. Act like wherever you are,
 that's the place to be.


1041
00:35:36.004 --> 00:35:36.200
여기 괜찮지 않니?

1042
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.995
Isn't this great?

1043
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.607
Four.

1044
00:35:38.607 --> 00:35:39.767
넷째

1045
00:35:40.742 --> 00:35:40.790
음식을 주문할 땐 여자가 뭘
원하는질 알아내고 시켜


1046
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:44.070
When ordering food, find out what she
 wants, then order for the both of you.


1047
00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:44.610
It's a classy move.

1048
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.908
아주 멋진 방법이지

1049
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.248
The lady will have
 the linguine in a white clam sauce,


1050
00:35:46.248 --> 00:35:49.115
여자들은 대부분
소스를 얹은 파스타와


1051
00:35:49.184 --> 00:35:49.340
얼음없는 콜라를 같이 시키지

1052
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.118
and a coke with no ice.

1053
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:51.920
And five.

1054
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.353
그리고 다섯번째

1055
00:35:53.522 --> 00:35:53.610
이게 가장 중요한거야

1056
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.116
Now, this is most important, Rat.

1057
00:35:57.092 --> 00:35:57.240
언제고 아주 섬세한 작업을
들어가게 되면...


1058
00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.410
When it comes down to makin' out,

1059
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.153
whenever possible,

1060
00:36:01.396 --> 00:36:01.480
가능한한 시간이 긴
음악을 미리 틀어놔


1061
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.456
put on side one
 of Led Zeppelin IV.


1062
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:14.740
차 좋은데

1063
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.339
- This is a nice car.
 - Yeah. It's my sister's.


1064
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:17.970
응, 우리 누나 차야

1065
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.072
Yeah?

1066
00:36:22.184 --> 00:36:22.380
혹시 조지선생님의
영어반에 있지 않니?


1067
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.448
Do you have Mrs. George
 for English?


1068
00:36:24.519 --> 00:36:24.540
응, 그 선생님 좋더라

1069
00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:26.111
- Yeah. She's pretty good.
 - Yeah, she is pretty good.


1070
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:28.451
응, 괜찮은 분이시지

1071
00:36:36.031 --> 00:36:36.190
정했니?

1072
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.521
- Have you decided?
 - Um, yeah.


1073
00:36:39.668 --> 00:36:40.090
난 독일 소시지 먹을래

1074
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.694
I'll have the knockwurst.

1075
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.373
Excellent.

1076
00:36:44.373 --> 00:36:45.032
좋아

1077
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.275
You work at Cinema Four, right?

1078
00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:47.970
너 극장에서 일하지?

1079
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:48.243
That must be great.
 You get to see all those free movies.


1080
00:36:48.243 --> 00:36:51.040
좋겠다...
영화는 다 공짜로 보잖아


1081
00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:51.542
You get free popcorn.

1082
00:36:51.613 --> 00:36:53.672
팝콘도 다 공짜일테고

1083
00:36:54.249 --> 00:36:54.300
괜찮아?

1084
00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.011
- Are you okay?
 - Yeah, I'm fine.


1085
00:36:55.884 --> 00:36:57.408
응

1086
00:36:57.786 --> 00:36:57.810
잠깐만 실례 좀
해도 괜찮을까?


1087
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.084
Would you mind if I excuse
 myself for a moment?


1088
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.656
Oh, no, go ahead.

1089
00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:01.486
그래

1090
00:37:02.457 --> 00:37:02.480
주문 하시겠어요?

1091
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:03.549
Are you ready to order here?

1092
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.920
얘는 독일 소시지를 주세요

1093
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.990
She will have the knockwurst.

1094
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.332
And you?

1095
00:37:10.332 --> 00:37:11.458
그리고요?

1096
00:37:13.068 --> 00:37:13.160
저도 같은걸로 주세요

1097
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.592
- I'll have the same.
 - Anything to drink?


1098
00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:15.934
마실것은요?

1099
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.471
- Coke.
 - Two Cokes.


1100
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:18.439
- 콜라요
- 콜라 두 잔이요


1101
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.341
Okay.
 Thank you.


1102
00:37:19.341 --> 00:37:21.571
고맙습니다

1103
00:37:23.111 --> 00:37:23.240
- 금방 올게
- 알았어


1104
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.079
- I'll be right back.
 - Okay.


1105
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.553
- Hello?
 - Mike, it's Mark.


1106
00:37:31.553 --> 00:37:33.453
- 여보세요?
- 마이크, 나 마크야


1107
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:33.789
- What happened to your date?
 - It's happening right now.
 Everything's fine except...


1108
00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:35.017
데이트는 잘하고 있어?

1109
00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.784
한가지만 빼곤
다 잘 풀려나가는 중인데...


1110
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.461
I left my wallet at home.

1111
00:37:39.461 --> 00:37:40.792
집에 지갑을 두고 왔어

1112
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:41.630
Why don't you go home and get it?

1113
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:42.858
그럼 집에 가서 가져 가

1114
00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:43.098
No, I can't! I'm here.
 The food's coming and everything.


1115
00:37:43.098 --> 00:37:46.124
지금 그렇게를 못해!
조금 있으면 음식이 나올거야


1116
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:46.220
나 좀 도와줘

1117
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.761
Look, would you do me a favor?

1118
00:37:48.837 --> 00:37:48.890
엄마 차를 빌려서
우리집으로 가서


1119
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.533
Just borrow your mom's car, drive to my
 house, get my wallet and bring it here.


1120
00:37:51.606 --> 00:37:53.540
내 지갑 가지고
이리 와줘


1121
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.745
Hello? Mike?

1122
00:37:56.745 --> 00:37:57.734
여보세요?
마이크?


1123
00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.682
Mike?

1124
00:38:00.682 --> 00:38:00.700
이런, 나 지금 좀 바빠

1125
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.446
Geez, I'm really kinda busy, Rat.

1126
00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:03.719
Just do me this one favor.

1127
00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:05.414
이번 한번만 도와주라

1128
00:38:05.487 --> 00:38:05.610
평생동안 앞으로는 어떤 부탁도
하지 않을 테니 제발...


1129
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.218
I swear I won't ask you for anything
 again in this lifetime or any other.


1130
00:38:09.358 --> 00:38:09.420
이번만 좀 도와줘

1131
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.723
- But just please do this for me.
 - You owe me for this one.


1132
00:38:10.792 --> 00:38:12.419
나중에 너 이거 갚아

1133
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.295
Okay, thanks.
 Thanks a lot. Thanks.


1134
00:38:13.295 --> 00:38:15.456
알았어, 고마워
정말 고마워


1135
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:15.697
- Beaver, are you all right?
 - What happened?


1136
00:38:15.697 --> 00:38:17.722
비버, 너 괜찮아?

1137
00:38:19.167 --> 00:38:19.961
뭐야?

1138
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.943
Are you sure there's nothing else
 I can bring you?


1139
00:38:27.943 --> 00:38:30.860
더 필요한거 정말로
없어요?


1140
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.279
Do you want another Coke?

1141
00:38:31.279 --> 00:38:32.712
콜라 더 마실래?

1142
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.216
Um... okay.

1143
00:38:34.216 --> 00:38:34.910
그래

1144
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.551
Two more Cokes.

1145
00:38:36.551 --> 00:38:37.449
콜라 두잔 더요

1146
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:38.253
Two more Cokes.

1147
00:38:38.253 --> 00:38:39.481
콜라 두잔 더

1148
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.188
- Hey, Mark, is that you?
 - Yeah, hi.


1149
00:38:40.188 --> 00:38:42.918
- 마크, 너 맞아?
- 응, 안녕


1150
00:38:42.991 --> 00:38:43.110
- 여긴 왠일이야?
- 독일 파스타 먹으러 왔지


1151
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.392
- You come here?
 - Yeah. I come for the strudel.
 It's great.


1152
00:38:46.695 --> 00:38:46.710
지난번에 네 지갑을 찾았는데
돌려줄까?


1153
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:49.687
Hey, listen, I found your wallet
 the other day. You want it back?


1154
00:38:49.865 --> 00:38:49.920
와! 그래
이걸 얼마나 찾았던지...


1155
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.493
Oh, wow! Yeah.
 I was looking for this.


1156
00:38:54.736 --> 00:38:54.760
마이크, 스테이시 모르지?

1157
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.636
Oh, Mike,
 you don't know Stacy Hamilton.


1158
00:38:56.738 --> 00:38:56.750
스테이시, 이쪽은 마이크야

1159
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.535
- Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
 - Hi.


1160
00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.776
- Hi.
 - Nice to meet you.


1161
00:39:00.776 --> 00:39:02.038
만나서 반갑다

1162
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.179
See you later.

1163
00:39:04.179 --> 00:39:04.975
나중에 보자

1164
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:05.847
Right. Gotta be goin'.
 See you later.


1165
00:39:05.847 --> 00:39:09.180
그래, 이제 가야지
나중에 보자


1166
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:11.953
You wanna go?

1167
00:39:11.953 --> 00:39:12.715
갈까?

1168
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.689
Um... yeah.

1169
00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:15.420
그래

1170
00:39:28.703 --> 00:39:28.800
오늘 정말 즐거웠어

1171
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.398
- I had a really nice time tonight.
 - Me too.


1172
00:39:30.472 --> 00:39:31.837
나도

1173
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.200
누가 네 차를 부수고
카세트를 훔쳐가서 정말 유감이야


1174
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.007
I'm real sorry someone broke in
 and stole your tape deck.


1175
00:39:35.076 --> 00:39:35.170
그런 좋은 동네에서 그런 일이
 벌어질줄은 생각도 못했어


1176
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.567
I never thought it would've happened
 at such a fancy place.


1177
00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:37.730
알아
잠깐 들어왔다 갈래?


1178
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:40.739
I know.
 You want to come in for a sec?


1179
00:39:43.518 --> 00:39:43.610
- 그래, 물론
- 좋아


1180
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.713
- Okay, sure.
 - Good.


1181
00:39:53.061 --> 00:39:53.220
오빠는 어디갔어?

1182
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.085
- Where's your brother?
 - He's out tonight with some friends.


1183
00:39:54.162 --> 00:39:55.891
친구들이랑 나갔어

1184
00:39:55.964 --> 00:39:56.050
- 마실것 가져다 줄까?
- 아니, 괜찮아


1185
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.120
- Can I get you something to drink?
 - No, that's... that's okay.


1186
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.195
Oh. Well,
 would you mind if I change?


1187
00:40:00.802 --> 00:40:03.464
나 옷 좀 갈아 입어도 괜찮겠지?

1188
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:04.072
No.

1189
00:40:04.072 --> 00:40:05.266
그래

1190
00:40:05.574 --> 00:40:05.720
그럼 이것 좀 풀어줄래?
항상 걸려 안 움직여


1191
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.839
Okay. Could you get this for me?
 It always sticks.


1192
00:40:16.351 --> 00:40:16.540
고마워

1193
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.648
Thanks.

1194
00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.427
Where are your parents?

1195
00:40:25.427 --> 00:40:26.792
부모님은 어디 가셨어?

1196
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.063
My parents are out of town
 for the weekend.


1197
00:40:28.063 --> 00:40:30.156
주말동안 여행 가셨어

1198
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.632
Brad and I are watching the house.

1199
00:40:30.632 --> 00:40:32.395
오빠랑 내가 집 지키는 중이야

1200
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:34.069
- This is a really nice picture of you.
 - Thanks.


1201
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:36.299
- 사진 정말 예쁘게 나왔다
- 고마워


1202
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.872
You can come in my room
 if you want.


1203
00:40:36.872 --> 00:40:38.635
내 방에 들어와

1204
00:40:49.351 --> 00:40:49.510
뭐 하고 싶어?

1205
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.581
So, what do you want to do?

1206
00:40:52.087 --> 00:40:52.100
글쎄...

1207
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.213
I don't know.

1208
00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.558
Um, you want to look
 at a photo album?


1209
00:40:56.558 --> 00:40:58.048
내 사진첩 볼래?

1210
00:40:58.126 --> 00:40:58.180
어릴때부터 사진을
다 가지고 있어


1211
00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.323
I keep a lot of pictures
 from when I grew up and stuff.


1212
00:41:01.396 --> 00:41:01.520
- 너무 바보같은가?
- 아니, 사진 보자


1213
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.626
- It's kinda stupid, huh?
 - Sure! Yeah.


1214
00:41:03.698 --> 00:41:03.780
정말? 좋아

1215
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.893
Yeah? Great.

1216
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:09.571
Photographs.

1217
00:41:09.571 --> 00:41:10.731
사진들

1218
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:13.141
This is the one that Brad took.

1219
00:41:13.141 --> 00:41:14.472
이건 오빠가 찍은 사진이야

1220
00:41:14.543 --> 00:41:14.560
이건 거울속에 비친
모습같은 거야


1221
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.569
It's like double-image type thing,
 you know. It's like a mirror.


1222
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:17.946
This is me being stupid.

1223
00:41:17.946 --> 00:41:20.779
이건 내가 바보짓 하는 거고

1224
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.017
And this is my dog Gypsy,
 and my cat Tullio.


1225
00:41:22.017 --> 00:41:25.180
이건 키우던 개 집시랑
고양이 툴리오인데


1226
00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:25.520
- They're dead now.
 - Remember him? Mr. Degan?


1227
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.249
지금은 죽었어

1228
00:41:27.322 --> 00:41:28.846
누군지 기억나? 디건 선생님?

1229
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.891
You had Degan?

1230
00:41:29.891 --> 00:41:31.051
디건 선생님 반이었어?

1231
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.359
- He always wore the same suit!
 - The same suit!


1232
00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:33.350
맨날 똑같은 옷만 입잖아!

1233
00:41:33.461 --> 00:41:33.520
그 옷이 500개는 넘나봐

1234
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:34.951
- He must've had 500 of those suits.
 - He was terrible!


1235
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.050
정말 끔찍했지!
아마 단벌신사였을거야


1236
00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.295
No, I think it was one.

1237
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:45.260
<i>So you go out there
 and you get one too</i>


1238
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.330
<i>Love rules</i>

1239
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.030
<i>Ohh, love rules</i>

1240
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.880
<i>Love rules</i>

1241
00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.780
<i>Yeah, love rules</i>

1242
00:42:05.627 --> 00:42:05.750
갑자기 생각이 났는데

1243
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.527
- You know, I just thought of something.
 - What?


1244
00:42:09.497 --> 00:42:09.590
차에 관해서는 우리 누나는
장난이 아니게 민감해


1245
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.625
My sister is crazy
 when it comes to her car.


1246
00:42:12.701 --> 00:42:12.820
- 11시까지 돌려줘야 하거든
- 전화 할래?


1247
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:14.601
- It's gotta be back by 11:00.
 - Want to call her?


1248
00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:14.970
No. Look, l... 
She gets crazy.

1249
00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:18.633
아니, 그러니깐...
정말 화내


1250
00:42:18.707 --> 00:42:18.820
누난 차를 아기처럼 아껴

1251
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.902
Her car is her baby.

1252
00:42:21.009 --> 00:42:21.060
- 가야겠어
- 그럴래?


1253
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.239
- I better be going.
 - Really?


1254
00:42:23.345 --> 00:42:23.400
전화 할게
아니 학교에서 보자


1255
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.336
I'll call you.
 Well, I'll see you in class. Okay?


1256
00:42:25.647 --> 00:42:26.705
알았지?

1257
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:27.649
Bye.

1258
00:42:27.649 --> 00:42:28.775
잘있어

1259
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.740
<i>Love rules</i>

1260
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:55.610
- Mark Ratner doesn't like me.
 - Mark Ratner doesn't like you?
 You're crazy!


1261
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:56.941
마크가 날 안 좋아해

1262
00:42:57.012 --> 00:42:59.173
말이 돼?

1263
00:42:59.247 --> 00:42:59.340
아니 정말로 나한테 아예
관심이 없는걸 비췄어


1264
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.239
No, he shows absolutely
 no interest in me.


1265
00:43:02.317 --> 00:43:02.400
마크는 네가 먼저 작업을
들어가야 하는 스타일이야


1266
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.651
Mark Ratner is definitely somebody
 you'd have to make the first move with.


1267
00:43:06.721 --> 00:43:06.780
린다, 그렇게 했지, 내가 먼저
온갖 유혹을 했지만


1268
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.623
Linda, I did. I made the first move,
 I made the second move.


1269
00:43:10.692 --> 00:43:10.770
나만 완전 바보 됐다니깐

1270
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.320
I made a complete jerk out of myself,
 is what I did.


1271
00:43:13.395 --> 00:43:13.410
마크 같은 애는 신경 꺼!

1272
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.420
What do you care about
 Mark Ratner for?


1273
00:43:15.497 --> 00:43:15.610
그저 16살짜리
극장 문지기일 뿐이야


1274
00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:18.261
He's a 16-year-old usher
 in the movie theater.


1275
00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:18.450
넌 더 나이 많은
남자랑 사귀어 봤고


1276
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:20.164
You have dated older guys. You work
 at the best food stand in the mall.


1277
00:43:20.235 --> 00:43:22.567
백화점 최고 음식점에서
일하고 있고


1278
00:43:22.637 --> 00:43:22.690
넌 나랑 가장 친한 친구야

1279
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.164
And you are a close
 personal friend of mine.


1280
00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:27.290
응, 하지만 마크가 정말로
좋아지기 시작했어


1281
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:31.372
Yeah. But I was really
 beginning to like him.


1282
00:43:32.013 --> 00:43:32.030
그래? 그게 사실이면
너 빨리 다른 사람을 만나야 겠다


1283
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:35.540
Yeah? If that's true,
 you better find somebody else fast.


1284
00:43:45.493 --> 00:43:45.650
이번 플레이 보이지 봤어?

1285
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.188
- Seen the new Playboy?
 - Good?


1286
00:43:47.262 --> 00:43:48.354
괜찮아?

1287
00:43:48.763 --> 00:43:48.820
쭉쭉빵빵이야!

1288
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:50.355
- Bo Derek's tits!
 - All right!


1289
00:43:50.432 --> 00:43:51.922
좋았어!

1290
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.434
I like sex.

1291
00:43:52.434 --> 00:43:54.231
난 섹스가 좋아

1292
00:43:57.605 --> 00:43:58.670
운전 못하는 사람들은
면허증을 뺏어야 한다니깐


1293
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.063
People on ludes
 should not drive.


1294
00:44:09.217 --> 00:44:09.310
이거 우리 형 차야!

1295
00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:11.151
Hey, this is my brother's car!

1296
00:44:11.886 --> 00:44:11.970
- 형 여행 갔다며
- 그렇지


1297
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:14.286
- You said he was outta town.
 - And he is.


1298
00:44:14.355 --> 00:44:14.410
알았어, 그럼 걱정할게 없잖아

1299
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.687
All right.
 Then don't hassle it.


1300
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.040
Are you crazy, Spicoli?
 That light was red!


1301
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.304
미쳤어?
빨간불이었어!


1302
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:34.809
- It was yellow a minute ago.
 - You're gonna scratch my brother's car.


1303
00:44:34.809 --> 00:44:36.401
그 전에 노란불이었어

1304
00:44:36.478 --> 00:44:39.470
이러다 우리 형차에
흠집 내겠어


1305
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:40.130
아니, 그럴 일 없어

1306
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.742
No, I'm not.

1307
00:44:42.817 --> 00:44:43.237
운전은 내가 하니깐
넌 길이나 잘 봐


1308
00:44:43.237 --> 00:44:46.685
Look, I'm driving.
 You navigate.


1309
00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:48.280
파티를 어디서 하는거야?

1310
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.089
Where is this party?

1311
00:44:51.459 --> 00:44:51.790
여기서 우회전해
여기, 여기야!


1312
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.326
Make a right, right here.
 Here! Here! Here!


1313
00:45:11.312 --> 00:45:11.570
형이 우릴 둘 다 죽일거야!
우린 둘 다 죽었어!


1314
00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.247
My brother's gonna kill us!
 He's gonna kill us!


1315
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.916
He's gonna kill you. He's gonna kill me.
 He's gonna kill us!


1316
00:45:14.916 --> 00:45:17.783
형도 죽일거고
나도 죽이고 둘 다 죽일거야!


1317
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:18.820
Hey, man, just be glad
 I had fast reflexes.


1318
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.070
야, 내가 반사작용이
빨랐던걸 고맙게 생각해


1319
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.584
- My brother's gonna shit!
 - Make up your mind, dude.


1320
00:45:21.656 --> 00:45:22.782
우리 형이 우릴 팰거야!

1321
00:45:23.324 --> 00:45:24.689
도대체 어떤거야?

1322
00:45:24.759 --> 00:45:24.780
우릴 팰거야 아님 죽일거야?

1323
00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.727
Is he gonna shit,
 or is he gonna kill us?


1324
00:45:26.795 --> 00:45:26.880
우릴 죽을때까지
팰거야


1325
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:29.523
First he's gonna shit,
 then he's gonna kill us.


1326
00:45:30.532 --> 00:45:30.650
침착해, 알았어?
울 아버지가 TV 수리공이야


1327
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.401
Relax, all right?
 My old man is a television repairman.


1328
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.737
He's got this ultimate set of tools.
 I can fix it!


1329
00:45:35.737 --> 00:45:39.730
모든 장비가 다 있으니
내가 고칠수 있어


1330
00:45:40.508 --> 00:45:40.570
그걸로 차는 수리 못해!

1331
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.999
You can't fix this car, Spicoli!

1332
00:45:47.182 --> 00:45:48.308
고칠수 있어

1333
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.910
- I can fix it.
 - Ha.
