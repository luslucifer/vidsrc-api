我们在搬家

对不起
I'm sorry.


28
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.706
没关系的啦
It's all right. Just leave that there.

你认识他？
Do you know him?

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.929
不
No.


35
00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.528
我们进去
We go.


36
00:03:37.972 --> 00:03:42.704
我怎么会忘记他
吉村贯一郎
How could I forget him?
Kanichiro Yoshimura...


37
00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:46.712
我最憎恨的男人...
The man I hated most...


38
00:03:46.847 --> 00:03:51.510
在那战乱不断的幕府末年
战斗着的

副官士方正在招募天下的流浪武士

45
00:04:23.348 --> 00:04:26.510
新选组刚刚成立
...as the Shogun's power ebbed.


46
00:04:28.253 --> 00:04:33.121
那是最志得意满的时候
I first saw Yoshimura
among a group of recruits...


47
00:04:33.257 --> 00:04:37.920
在比武选出的新入人员里
...selected by our Lieutenant,
Toshizo Hijikata.


48
00:04:38.963 --> 00:04:41.726
有个叫吉村贯一郎的家伙

He's the same school as you, Ito.


54
00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.118
从来没见过
Never seen him.


55
00:05:08.258 --> 00:05:10.020
永仓君
Mr. Nagakura...


56
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.423
用真剑比试一下吧
How about trying one
with a real sword?


57
00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:17.221
唉，冲田
Okita!


58
00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:22.393
不要紧
它们并不锋利
It's all right. They're not sharp.


59
00:05:30.144 --> 00:05:34.102
你们没用真剑练习过吧？
Your school doesn't train
with real swords, does it.


60
00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:36.306
是啊
That's right, sir.


61
00:05:41.155 --> 00:05:45.420
请手下留情
Go easy on me.


62
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:51.428
你忘了件东西 戴上这个

63
00:05:52.332 --> 00:05:53.889
啊，是
I might miss, too.


64
00:05:58.038 --> 00:06:02.406
你也忘了
You wear one as well.


65
00:06:02.542 --> 00:06:04.600
我不需要
I won't need it.

Yoshimura!
Sir?

83
00:08:18.036 --> 00:08:23.405
今后，你们俩做剑术教练
You will work with him
as an instructor in swordsmanship.


84
00:08:23.542 --> 00:08:25.702
好吗，伊东？
All right, Ito?


85
00:08:25.844 --> 00:08:27.504
何事？
Hijikata?


86
00:08:27.646 --> 00:08:32.105
噢，你让在下作为...
Uh, you're making me...


87
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:35.310
新选组的...
...an instructor...


88
00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:39.183
剑术教练吗？
...for the Shinsengumi?


89
00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:45.827
啊，太感谢了
Well, thank you very much!


90
00:08:52.436 --> 00:08:54.300
那么...
And now...


91
00:08:55.739 --> 00:09:01.005
借此地我宣布一件事
...I have an announcement to make.


92
00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:03.307
谷君
Tani...


93
00:09:03.547 --> 00:09:05.309
昌武君
Masatake...


94
00:09:05.448 --> 00:09:07.108
上前来
Come forward.


95
00:09:08.752 --> 00:09:14.189
欢迎光临
我来帮您放剑
Welcome.
I'll take your sword.


96
00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:20.786
这次
谷三十郎之弟 昌武
Sanjuro Tani's
younger brother Masatake...


97
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.295
将成为我近藤家的养子
...will be adopted into my Kondo family.


98
00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:29.096
因此他将改名为周平
He will henceforth
be known as 'Shuhei'.


99
00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:34.402
我请大家关照他们
I ask you all...
...to give him your support.


100
00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:38.202
恳请各位关照
I ask it, too.


101
00:09:39.147 --> 00:09:44.311
这样天然理心流可以说
后继有人了
The Tennen Sword school
now has an heir...to its leader!


102
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.894
你干什么？
What are you doing?!


103
00:09:58.031 --> 00:09:59.998
- 滚
- 什么？
Move.
What?!


104
00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.793
斋藤君
Mr. Saito...


105
00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:06.898
你就不能先问一下吗
...you could have just asked.


106
00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:23.381
我有个特别的节目带给各位
就放在这里呢
I will now entertain!
I have a special treat for you.


107
00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:49.006
近藤不是坏人
但却势利
Kondo wasn't a bad man,
but he was a snob.


108
00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:54.378
他迎合权贵
重用油腔滑调的蠢货
His taste for distinguished families
and promotion of glib fools...


109
00:10:54.518 --> 00:10:57.975
自然让谷的弟弟周平做了继承人
...led to his adopting
this younger brother...


110
00:10:58.422 --> 00:11:05.987
所以即使冲田理当做继承人
也没有机会
...passing over Okita,
the natural choice to succeed him.


111
00:11:06.129 --> 00:11:11.191
斋藤先生 喝酒啊
Saito-sensei... have a drink.


112
00:11:14.037 --> 00:11:17.494
我叫吉村贯一郎
My name is Kanichiro Yoshimura.


113
00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:24.411
我是新来的
就像你前面看到的
I'm a new man.
Just so you'll know who I am...


114
00:11:29.618 --> 00:11:31.778
斋藤先生
Saito-sensei?


115
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.382
你从哪个国家来啊？
What land are you from,


116
00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:38.981
- 国家？
- 是啊
'Land'?
Yes.


117
00:11:40.729 --> 00:11:44.789
在下出生在
南部盛冈
I was born in Morioka,
in Nanbu, Oshu.


118
00:11:44.932 --> 00:11:47.798
是个美丽的地方
It's a beautiful place.


119
00:11:48.135 --> 00:11:49.897
请...
Please...


120
00:11:54.241 --> 00:11:58.404
离南边很远的
早池峰山
Away to the south is Mt Hayachine...


121
00:11:58.512 --> 00:12:00.672
西边是 南昌山和东根山
...with Mt Nansho and Mt Azumane
to the west.


122
00:12:00.815 --> 00:12:04.375
北方有岩手山 姬神山
In the north are
Mt Iwate and Mt Himekami.


123
00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:09.078
周围高山环绕
Out of the high mountains
flows the Nakatsu River...


124
00:12:09.222 --> 00:12:12.782
城下的流淌的中津河同樱马场下的
北上河汇合
...through the castle town into
the Kitakami below Sakuranobaba.


125
00:12:12.926 --> 00:12:16.986
啊，多么美丽的一副画啊
Ah, it's pretty as a picture!


126
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.792
在日本没有我更喜欢的地方了
There's nowhere like it in all Japan!


127
00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:22.695
啊，请喝酒
Oh, please... allow me.


128
00:12:26.939 --> 00:12:32.274
昨晚，我梦见了我的小女儿
Last night I dreamed
about my little girl.


129
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:37.780
在我们乡下她是最美丽的女孩
就像她妈妈一样
She's the image of her mother,
who was the prettiest girl in town.


130
00:12:41.619 --> 00:12:46.180
已经很久没有见到他们了
It's just been so long since I saw her...


131
00:12:46.324 --> 00:12:52.990
夸完老家夸家人
俗不可耐的乡下武士
An awful country samurai,
bragging about home and family.


132
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:58.395
当我离家的时候
When I left home...


133
00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:02.893
她才五岁
...she was only five.


134
00:13:05.142 --> 00:13:07.974
即使如今...
Even then...


135
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:14.872
她是一个多么美妙的小女孩啊
...she was such a sweet little thing
it took your breath away.


136
00:13:22.825 --> 00:13:28.694
这时我已经一个月没有杀过人了
It had been a month then
since I'd killed a man.


137
00:13:32.134 --> 00:13:34.499
我儿子嘉一郎
My son Kaichiro...


138
00:13:34.637 --> 00:13:38.197
剑术和学问都出类拔萃
...is a fine swordsman and scholar.


139
00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:43.275
啊，不不，不能这么说
我是他爸呀
I don't just say that
because I'm his father.


140
00:13:43.411 --> 00:13:45.378
他会成为南部的一个好武士
He'll be a fine samurai.


141
00:13:45.513 --> 00:13:49.073
我决定要杀了这个人
I decided I'd kill this man.


142
00:13:50.819 --> 00:13:52.683
请
Please...


143
00:13:55.322 --> 00:13:59.189
送我走到我的住处吧
Could you walk me back
to my lodging?


144
00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:01.190
什么？
Sorry?


145
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.395
我醉了，走起来不安全
I'm drunk, and it's not safe to go
staggering down the street alone.


146
00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:09.695
啊，好
Right.


147
00:14:10.737 --> 00:14:12.761
当然
Of course.


148
00:14:31.423 --> 00:14:33.890
这里就是了
This should do.


149
00:14:34.025 --> 00:14:36.584
这儿？
Here?


150
00:14:50.908 --> 00:14:53.273
玩笑会开过头的
A joke can go too far, sir.


151
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.172
你为什么要这样
I ask you the reason for this.


152
00:14:55.312 --> 00:14:57.074
不为什么
There is no reason.


153
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:05.881
你杀人不要理由？
You'd kill for no reason?


154
00:15:06.023 --> 00:15:09.685
- 我只是不喜欢你
- 你疯了
I just don't like you.
You're crazy!


155
00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.967
去死
Die!


156
00:15:22.906 --> 00:15:28.969
你不会得逞的
我不要死
I can't allow that to happen.
I won't die.


157
00:15:53.401 --> 00:15:55.960
开个玩笑
I'm not serious.


158
00:15:56.103 --> 00:15:59.265
我只想试试你
I just wanted to test you.


159
00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:07.478
我希望这是你最后一次试我
I ask that this be
the last time you test me.


160
00:16:10.216 --> 00:16:15.175
你不想死？
那是什么武士？
You don't want to die?
What kind of samurai is that?


161
00:16:15.322 --> 00:16:18.586
没人真正想死的吧？
No one really wants to die.


162
00:16:18.725 --> 00:16:20.885
斋藤先生难道不是这样吗？
Are you any different?


163
00:16:21.027 --> 00:16:25.963
我不在乎，没人杀的了我
我才活着
I don't care. I'm only alive
because no one will kill me.


164
00:16:26.098 --> 00:16:28.565
我不一样
I'm different.


165
00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:32.158
我杀人是因为我不想死
I kill because I don't want to die.


166
00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:45.080
这次背山多喜人违反了队规
For violating the rules of our troop,
Takito Seyama has been ordered...


167
00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:47.479
被要求切腹自尽
...to commit hara-kiri.


168
00:16:47.618 --> 00:16:50.381
当他要自尽的时候
When he has cut himself open,


169
00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:53.580
你们新来的要砍下他的头
you new men will remove his head.


170
00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:55.885
他犯了什么事？
What is his crime?


171
00:16:56.027 --> 00:16:59.257
那和你无关
That doesn't concern you.


172
00:17:00.098 --> 00:17:03.362
不许失手
Do not fail.


173
00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:07.062
我明白了
I will obey.


174
00:17:27.023 --> 00:17:29.081
快一点
Hurry it up.


175
00:17:41.503 --> 00:17:45.268
不，不要啊！
No! Please! Stop!


176
00:18:04.224 --> 00:18:06.555
我真的错了
I'm truly sorry.


177
00:18:07.995 --> 00:18:10.861
原谅我 作孽啊
Forgive me.


178
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:18.065
这是酬劳
Payment.


179
00:18:18.204 --> 00:18:20.763
到岛原去玩玩吧
Go have fun in Shimabara.


180
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.278
你不想要吗？
Don't you want it?


181
00:18:27.413 --> 00:18:30.074
我不能接受这个
I can't accept this!


182
00:18:31.617 --> 00:18:33.880
是吗
I see.


183
00:18:38.223 --> 00:18:40.349
士方先生
Hijikata-sensei...


184
00:18:40.992 --> 00:18:45.860
像你知道的
现在的状况...
...as you're aware,
the circumstances...


185
00:18:45.997 --> 00:18:49.363
为人补刀的事很难的
...made the task quite difficult.


186
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:54.062
我的剑都钝了
It caused a chip in the blade
of my sword.


187
00:18:54.205 --> 00:18:56.172
可以的话，我能问你
Could I perhaps ask


188
00:18:56.407 --> 00:19:00.672
要点钱，买把新剑吗？
for the cost of a new sword?


189
00:19:10.821 --> 00:19:15.450
这是钱
你的剑上没有刻字吧？
That should do. Your blade
doesn't bear its maker's name.


190
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:52.949
那我就不客气了
You're too kind.


191
00:20:00.902 --> 00:20:03.267
笑纳了
My humble thanks!


192
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.972
什么人啊
What kind of a samurai is that?


193
00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:17.173
那也是武士吗？
对吉村来说，不少钱啊
He's really something!


194
00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.861
那把钝剑在哪？
Where's it chipped?


195
00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:37.660
这剑像我一样用旧了
My sword's as worn down as I am.


196
00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:40.862
新选组
The Shinsengumi


197
00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:44.168
在幕府末年的动乱里有名无实
was the sterile flower
of the Shoguns' end.


198
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:50.680
在新选组中他是个拼命又吝啬的
少有的人
And here was this miser
squirreling away all he could.


199
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.147
以防万一，我们在检查是否有传染性
We're checking to make sure
it's nothing contagious.


200
00:21:02.293 --> 00:21:06.058
还要再花点时间
It"ll take a bit more time.


201
00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:11.360
对不起
我来的不是时候
I'm sorry.
I've come at a bad time.


202
00:21:14.104 --> 00:21:17.163
你想喝点吗？
Would you like a drink?


203
00:21:18.108 --> 00:21:21.873
很多客人用酒来付帐
A lot of our patients
pay their bills with alcohol.


204
00:21:22.012 --> 00:21:26.345
我们明天就搬了，还有那么多酒
We're moving tomorrow,
and we have all that left...


205
00:21:31.487 --> 00:21:34.148
哦...
我不知道该说什么好
Oh...
I don't know what to say...


206
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:39.955
我听说过你用酒当作医疗费收
I heard you'd accept alcohol
for your fee...


207
00:21:43.898 --> 00:21:48.960
即使我收到现金我还是会去买酒的
If you gave me money,
I'd just buy liquor with it.


208
00:21:51.006 --> 00:21:53.166
不要客气
You're too kind.


209
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.843
那，喝一杯吧
Anyway, have a drink.


210
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.142
那就不客气啦
You're too kind.


211
00:22:08.088 --> 00:22:11.648
因为是你父亲？
Your father?


212
00:22:11.792 --> 00:22:13.850
什么？
Hm?


213
00:22:16.797 --> 00:22:18.764
哦...不是
Oh...No.


214
00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:34.736
我受过这个人的熏陶
That gentleman was my teacher.


215
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:37.241
南部盛冈...
Morioka


216
00:22:37.383 --> 00:22:40.044
离江户140里
is 140 leagues from Edo...


217
00:22:40.185 --> 00:22:45.349
奥冈街道的遥远之地
没有像西国那样受到祝福
...at the end of the Oshu road,
and not blessed like the west country.


218
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.449
官吏们很有钱，可伏身于西国
的孩子们想发迹，保卫部族
To stand up for your own land against
the children of those rich ones...


219
00:22:50.595 --> 00:22:54.860
可不是件容易的事啊
...is no easy thing.


220
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.866
盛冈的樱花
The Morioka cherry blossom


221
00:22:58.903 --> 00:23:01.962
破石而出之花
splits through rock to bloom.


222
00:23:03.007 --> 00:23:05.440
盛冈的木兰
The Morioka magnolia blooms


223
00:23:05.576 --> 00:23:08.442
朝北开花
even facing north.


224
00:23:11.782 --> 00:23:20.052
所以我不想你们等着春天来临…
那时春暖花开
So I don't want you to wait until
spring comes...and it's nice and warm.


225
00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:24.450
破石而出
Split that rock.


226
00:23:26.596 --> 00:23:29.462
赶超时间，赶超他人
Run ahead of the times.


227
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.460
美丽地
Go wild.


228
00:23:32.602 --> 00:23:35.069
绽放吧
Bloom.


229
00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:39.231
吉村老师
虽然是下级的武士
Yoshlmura-sensei was
a low-ranked samurai...


230
00:23:39.375 --> 00:23:43.037
但由于在才学和剑术上的造诣
...known for his learning
and swordsmanship.


231
00:23:43.178 --> 00:23:46.146
我们部族让他做我们学校的老师
Our clan made him a teacher
at its school.


232
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:48.942
收腰
Waist narrow!


233
00:23:53.188 --> 00:23:55.451
喂，千秋
Squire Chiaki!


234
00:23:56.491 --> 00:24:00.051
躯干收住，手臂放低
Your body's wide open.
Keep your arms down!


235
00:24:00.194 --> 00:24:01.353
是！
Yes!


236
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.964
好的，嘉一郎
Good, Kaichiro!


237
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:11.730
他的儿子像先生一样强壮
His son Kaichiro
was like him... strong...


238
00:24:11.873 --> 00:24:13.635
而且温和
...and gentle.


239
00:24:14.174 --> 00:24:16.539
你没事吧？千秋
Are you all right?


240
00:24:16.687 --> 00:24:19.679
“让我们到桃树下去
'Let's go to the peach tree.'


241
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.437
御津...
Mitsu...


242
00:24:21.681 --> 00:24:24.046
静...
我回来了
Shizu... I'm back.


243
00:24:26.887 --> 00:24:29.354
你回来了啊
Welcome home.


244
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.248
大野君好啊，都准备好了
Hello, Squire Ono.


245
00:24:36.295 --> 00:24:38.455
进来
Come in.


246
00:24:38.898 --> 00:24:40.558
走
Go on.


247
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.260
御津...
Mitsu...


248
00:24:48.174 --> 00:24:53.941
吉村老师作为武士还算体面
Yoshimura-sensei had to
struggle to keep up appearances.


249
00:24:54.078 --> 00:24:58.844
但其实家里只是勉强吃饱过活着
It was all he could do
to keep his family fed.


250
00:24:58.983 --> 00:25:02.850
但那时至少在我看来
But to my eyes at least...


251
00:25:02.987 --> 00:25:07.150
老师的生活非常幸福
...they seemed happy.


252
00:25:08.393 --> 00:25:13.056
可是后来，所有人都很吃惊
他离开了部落
But then, to everyone's surprise,
he left the clan...


253
00:25:13.197 --> 00:25:17.064
把他的家人抛在身后
...leaving his family behind.


254
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:22.537
在那时候离开自己的部族
如同流亡背叛
In those days leaving one's clan
was practically treason.


255
00:25:22.673 --> 00:25:26.938
而且，和孩子们说南部武士的心得
But what really shocked me
was that a man...


256
00:25:27.077 --> 00:25:31.740
不停地说着夸耀南部之美的老师
...who preached the virtues
of Nanbu samurai...


257
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:34.348
居然背叛了自己的部族
...and was so proud
of the beauty of his land...


258
00:25:34.484 --> 00:25:38.044
这让我十分震惊
...would abandon it.


259
00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:43.852
你爸是个叛徒!
Your old man's a traitor!


260
00:25:48.396 --> 00:25:50.056
真丢人
A disgrace!


261
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.323
他该死
He should die!


262
00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:57.827
作为武士谢罪
必须切腹自尽
A real samurai apologizes
by spilling his guts!


263
00:25:58.373 --> 00:26:00.033
切腹，切！
Hara-kiri!


264
00:26:00.175 --> 00:26:01.835
等一下
Stop!


265
00:26:09.884 --> 00:26:11.851
我有话要说
I will speak.


266
00:26:12.386 --> 00:26:14.546
吉村老师
Yoshimura-sensei


267
00:26:14.688 --> 00:26:18.851
为我爸爸大野次郎右卫门做事
served my father, Jiroemon Ono.


268
00:26:19.493 --> 00:26:23.656
属下的错
就是主人的错
The sin of an underling
is the sin of his master.


269
00:26:26.065 --> 00:26:28.225
如果嘉一郎要自尽的话
If Kaichiro has to kill himself,


270
00:26:28.368 --> 00:26:32.030
我也要
so do I.


271
00:26:32.171 --> 00:26:35.230
这是你们想要的吗？
Is that your wish?


272
00:26:36.576 --> 00:26:37.633
如何？
Come on.


273
00:26:44.383 --> 00:26:46.441
你没事吧？嘉一郎
Are you all right?


274
00:26:47.185 --> 00:26:49.345
对不起，千秋阁下
I'm sorry，
Squire Chiaki.


275
00:26:49.488 --> 00:26:53.446
为我，你这么做...
you had to do that for me,


276
00:26:55.294 --> 00:27:00.526
嘉一郎的沮丧
看着让我无法忍受
I couldn't stand to see
Kaichiro lose heart that way.


277
00:27:01.266 --> 00:27:05.725
嘉一郎带着剩下的家人
Starting with Kaichiro,
the rest of the family...


278
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:12.433
被赶出部族 投靠远亲去了
...were driven from the clan's domain
to seek refuge with relatives.


279
00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.538
风铃
Wind chimes!


280
00:27:19.684 --> 00:27:23.244
卖风铃
Wind chimes for sale!


281
00:27:23.987 --> 00:27:25.749
辛苦了
Well done.


282
00:27:25.889 --> 00:27:29.051
下一位，吉村贯一郎
Kanichiro Yoshimura!


283
00:27:30.093 --> 00:27:33.220
- 是
- 二两 三分 三朱
Sir!

284
00:27:42.972 --> 00:27:44.939
辛苦了
Well done.


285
00:27:45.074 --> 00:27:47.337
谢谢了
My humble thanks.


286
00:27:55.384 --> 00:27:56.247
下一位
Next!


287
00:27:56.385 --> 00:28:00.047
- 下一位
- 西村辰之助君
Next!
Tatsunosuke Nishimura!


288
00:28:00.188 --> 00:28:03.247
谢谢
Thank you!


289
00:28:04.993 --> 00:28:07.222
二两 一分 二朱

290
00:28:30.484 --> 00:28:32.849
劳驾
Hello!


291
00:28:32.986 --> 00:28:34.850
欢迎光临
Hello again!


292
00:28:34.988 --> 00:28:38.047
还是这个帮我寄出去
Could you send this, please?


293
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.214
知道了
Certainly.


294
00:28:44.063 --> 00:28:48.226
吉村先生
这里有您一封信
Mr. Yoshimura...
here's a letter for you.


295
00:28:48.367 --> 00:28:50.425
啊，谢谢了
My humble thanks!


296
00:28:50.569 --> 00:28:53.731
我去写个收条，稍等片刻
I'll write you a receipt.


297
00:29:03.181 --> 00:29:06.445
亲爱的父亲
'Dear Father...


298
00:29:06.685 --> 00:29:10.848
我已经读了父亲的信了
'I have read your letter...


299
00:29:10.989 --> 00:29:16.016
听到您很好，我很高兴
'...and it is wonderful to hear
that you are well.


300
00:29:17.361 --> 00:29:21.228
母亲，御津身体都很好
'Mother and Mitsu are
in good health...


301
00:29:21.365 --> 00:29:26.927
庆次郎已经开始会说话和调皮了
'...and Keijiro is learning both
to speak and to make mischief.


302
00:29:27.071 --> 00:29:30.631
我在田里帮忙干活
'I am helping in the fields...


303
00:29:30.774 --> 00:29:34.038
同时每天勤勉练剑
'...and continuing to practice
with my sword.


304
00:29:34.777 --> 00:29:41.841
御津时常在梦里叫着“爸爸，爸爸”
'Mitsu sometimes calls out
"Papa" in her sleep.


305
00:29:42.585 --> 00:29:44.745
我也想去京都
'I would like to come to Kyoto


306
00:29:44.887 --> 00:29:50.916
和父亲一起做个武士
and serve with you as a samurai.


307
00:29:52.561 --> 00:29:56.428
我会照顾好家里
'I will take care of our family,


308
00:29:56.565 --> 00:29:58.828
所以请您放心
so please do not be uneasy.'


309
00:29:58.967 --> 00:30:02.732
- 施舍一点吧
- 施舍一点啊
Alms!
Alms!


310
00:30:07.075 --> 00:30:11.738
大人施舍点吧
Please, sir! Alms for the poor!


311
00:30:13.681 --> 00:30:15.739
数年前南部盛冈藩
For several years Morioka


312
00:30:15.883 --> 00:30:20.910
遭受了持续的饥荒
had suffered a harsh famine.


313
00:30:21.756 --> 00:30:25.623
当我开始为嘉一郎担心的时候
Just as I was
getting worried about Kaichiro...


314
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.423
我遇到许久未见的嘉一郎
...who should I run into
after some time but the man himself.


315
00:30:44.277 --> 00:30:51.045
亲爱的静 嘉一郎 御津 庆次郎
'Dear Shizu, Kaichiro, Mitsu
and Keijiro...


316
00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:53.707
大家都好吗？
'Are you well?'


317
00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:55.910
嘉一郎
Kaichiro!


318
00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:05.922
原谅我
I'm sorry...


319
00:31:06.063 --> 00:31:08.326
原谅我，千秋阁下
...Squire Chiaki!


320
00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:11.227
说什么呢，嘉一郎 拜托
Please!


321
00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:14.531
你不用向我下跪的
You don't have to bow to me!


322
00:31:14.972 --> 00:31:17.132
我们是朋友
We're friends!


323
00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:19.139
原谅我
Forgive me!


324
00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:21.535
嘉一郎
Kaichiro!


325
00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:24.638
嘉一郎
Kaichiro!


326
00:31:29.452 --> 00:31:31.214
是吗...
I see...


327
00:31:31.955 --> 00:31:35.822
贯一郎在这样为家里寄生活费那？
That's how Kanichiro's supporting
his family?


328
00:31:35.959 --> 00:31:40.520
因为这样，吉村老师才被逼无奈
脱离部族的吗？
Why was Yoshimura-sensei
driven from the clan?


329
00:31:41.665 --> 00:31:46.124
凭父亲的力量总能做点什么吧？
Surely you could have
done something, Father.


330
00:31:46.268 --> 00:31:50.727
我不能徇情枉法
I cannot act out of personal feeling.


331
00:31:50.873 --> 00:31:55.241
背离国家的人有什么好担心的？
A man who leaves his clan
does not merit our concern.


332
00:31:55.377 --> 00:31:59.005
我们的脸都丢尽了
We suffered a serious loss of face.


333
00:32:05.253 --> 00:32:07.812
那么传言
So the rumor


334
00:32:07.956 --> 00:32:14.019
他加入新选组的事是真的啦
he's joined the Shinsengumi...is true.


335
00:32:15.363 --> 00:32:20.823
爸爸同吉村老师
是在同间大屋子里出生的童年伙伴
My father and Yoshimura-sensei
were born in the same barracks.


336
00:32:20.968 --> 00:32:24.926
吉村老师的父亲是个小人物
His father was
a minor Samurai of Foot.


337
00:32:25.072 --> 00:32:31.704
我爸爸和妈妈两就住在那间大屋子旁
My father lived there with his mother.


338
00:32:31.845 --> 00:32:37.009
可是突然之间他们的身份差距
发生了很大的变化
But suddenly a gap opened up
in their relative status.


339
00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.822
因为大野家的长子突然生病死了
The Ono family's son took sick
and died.


340
00:32:51.964 --> 00:32:53.931
我父亲，作为大野一个小妾的儿子
My father, the son of old Ono's
concubine,


341
00:32:54.066 --> 00:32:57.330
被大野家收养
was adopted as heir...


342
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.633
继承了大野家四百石的家产
父亲的境遇完全改变了
...to a 400-koku stipend.


343
00:33:01.773 --> 00:33:07.005
我怀着十分感激的心情
来到了大野家
It is with deepest gratitude
I enter the House of Ono.


344
00:33:07.145 --> 00:33:10.204
我出身卑微
Though I am of humble birth...


345
00:33:10.348 --> 00:33:13.111
作为小妾所生的儿子
As a concubine's son...


346
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:17.914
他的处境使他对家族的领导
只能是逆来顺受
...he was in no position to go against
the head of the family.


347
00:33:18.055 --> 00:33:24.323
也许父亲就是这样学着
在生活中挣扎求存的
He probably struggled to learn
to suppress all his own feelings.


348
00:33:25.162 --> 00:33:29.530
尽管他们的身份发生了变化，
也许就是这种变化
Despite, or perhaps because of,
their change in status...


349
00:33:29.667 --> 00:33:36.936
父亲最知心的朋友只有
下级武士的吉村老师
...the only one he could talk to
was Yoshimura-sensei.


350
00:33:37.173 --> 00:33:39.106
可是...
However...


351
00:33:39.242 --> 00:33:43.507
- 离开部族？
- 是的
Leave the clan?!
Yes.


352
00:33:44.347 --> 00:33:47.315
我听说世间动乱
I hear of great changes taking place.


353
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.612
忧国忧民的情感无法抑制
I cannot resist my nation's call...


354
00:33:50.753 --> 00:33:57.123
在下 离开部族 要为
保护皇上而献身 保卫幕府
...to revere the emperor, expel
the barbarians, and defend the Shogun.


355
00:33:57.259 --> 00:34:04.027
你以为我真的能相信你说的这些？
Do you really expect me
to believe that?


356
00:34:04.866 --> 00:34:11.327
我知道作物一再欠收
处境很差
I know it's hard on a tiny stipend
when the crops keep failing.


357
00:34:11.473 --> 00:34:14.202
但是 贯一
But Kanichiro...


358
00:34:14.342 --> 00:34:18.300
不要脱离部族，这么过分的事
让我很为难啊
...don't do something stupid
like leaving the clan.


359
00:34:20.348 --> 00:34:25.614
而且没有你我该怎么办
What will I do without you?


360
00:34:25.753 --> 00:34:29.119
在下决心已定
My resolve will not be shaken.


361
00:34:29.256 --> 00:34:33.419
怎么回事！贯一郎！
Why, Kanichiro?


362
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:39.527
我们难道不是从小一起长大的朋友吗？
Haven't we been friends
all our lives?


363
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.299
不要走
Please...


364
00:34:50.143 --> 00:34:52.804
十分抱歉
I'm truly sorry.


365
00:34:54.346 --> 00:34:58.008
混蛋，离开部族是一种犯罪
Fool! Leaving your clan is a crime!


366
00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.016
你以为我能原谅你吗？
I won't stand for it!


367
00:35:03.455 --> 00:35:05.615
父亲一边这么说着
但是后来我知道
So said my father.
It was only later I found out...


368
00:35:05.758 --> 00:35:11.525
他悄悄地给了
吉村老师一笔钱
...he'd secretly given Yoshimura-sensei
a letter of credit...


369
00:35:11.662 --> 00:35:14.221
做为他的盘缠
...for his journey.


370
00:35:24.642 --> 00:35:27.109
为什么...
Why...


371
00:35:28.446 --> 00:35:34.111
你有那位的照片啊？
...do you have that photograph?


372
00:35:36.153 --> 00:35:39.315
如果不是你的父亲...
If it's not your father...


373
00:35:41.758 --> 00:35:47.718
哦，那人我是我父亲的好友
That gentleman was
a friend of my father...


374
00:35:47.863 --> 00:35:53.994
同样也是我好友的父亲
...or to be more precise,
the father of my friend.


375
00:35:55.538 --> 00:35:59.405
他年纪和你差不多大啊
He'd be about your age.


376
00:36:00.643 --> 00:36:06.308
您知道新选组的事吗？
Would you have ever heard of
the Shinsengumi?


377
00:36:06.448 --> 00:36:09.007
啊，不
Well...


378
00:36:11.152 --> 00:36:17.715
新选组可厉害的狠啊
They were very powerful,
weren't they.


379
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:25.091
明治那会儿我是无能之辈
They were no use in the new era.


380
00:36:30.537 --> 00:36:34.404
爷爷，我要回家
Grandpa! I'm going home.


381
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:38.306
乖一点，好好看病
Be a good boy
and do as the doctor says!


382
00:36:38.445 --> 00:36:43.108
如果你不按她说的，你的病好不了哦
If you don't do as she says,
you won't get better.


383
00:36:50.256 --> 00:36:51.313
你弄好了没有？
Are you getting things cleaned up?


384
00:36:51.457 --> 00:36:54.516
- 我正打算做呢
- 真的，不疼
I was just starting.
What'll I do with you!


385
00:36:59.432 --> 00:37:00.193
走
Now.


386
00:37:06.938 --> 00:37:08.404
我们是新选组
We are the Shinsengumi!


387
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.099
我们要检查这间屋子
We have business here!


388
00:39:25.737 --> 00:39:27.203
去死
Die!


389
00:39:41.551 --> 00:39:45.384
- 新选组的人
- 什么？谁？
One of your men.
What? Who?


390
00:39:50.327 --> 00:39:52.385
他突然死的
He died instantly.


391
00:39:52.628 --> 00:39:56.893
谷三十郎
谁杀的？
Sanjuro Tani? Who killed him?


392
00:39:57.033 --> 00:39:59.500
不知道凶手
I don't know.


393
00:39:59.835 --> 00:40:04.794
他的尸体今早
在祗园社前被发现
He was found this morning
in front of Gion Shrine.


394
00:40:06.042 --> 00:40:07.599
谷...
Tani?


395
00:40:07.743 --> 00:40:11.701
谷最近旁若无人，自以为是
He'd been getting above himself.


396
00:40:11.946 --> 00:40:15.608
组员里有人对他很不满
The other men didn't like it.


397
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.888
你是说我们的人杀了他？
You're saying one of us did it?


398
00:40:23.024 --> 00:40:25.287
我们正在调查
We're investigating.


399
00:40:47.247 --> 00:40:48.611
凶手
Murderer!


400
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.478
- 住手
- 是你干的
Stop it!
You did this!


401
00:40:55.021 --> 00:40:58.478
我不允许你这么叫我
I will not allow serving the Shogun
to be called murder.


402
00:40:58.624 --> 00:41:00.682
什么？
What?!


403
00:41:01.027 --> 00:41:02.994
周平君
Shuhei!


404
00:41:09.034 --> 00:41:11.001
斋藤先生...
Saito-sensei...


405
00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:15.101
有点事我想问你
there's something
I'd like to ask you.


406
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.003
你不介意吧？
Would you mind?


407
00:41:21.246 --> 00:41:26.478
看起来下手很巧妙
A brilliantly executed cut
to the chest.


408
00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:30.575
先是自左向右一刀
The cut begins on the left.


409
00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:33.188
然后 还有
And one more thing.


410
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:43.798
从左边背部直刺心脏一刀
One stab from left of the spine
to the heart.


411
00:41:44.033 --> 00:41:48.401
筱原君现场调查后认为是凶手
有两人
Mr. Shinohara deduces
there were two culprits.


412
00:41:48.538 --> 00:41:51.802
- 两个人干的？
- 不对
A two-man job...


413
00:41:51.941 --> 00:41:56.502
在下认为对方是一个人
No. I believe
the assailant acted alone.


414
00:41:56.946 --> 00:42:00.574
在他身体倒下之前
After the body cut,
but before he fell...


415
00:42:00.717 --> 00:42:03.981
他已经被刺断气了
...he was finished off with a stab.


416
00:42:05.521 --> 00:42:07.886
手段很高明啊
A deft swordsman, then.


417
00:42:08.023 --> 00:42:09.785
我早就听说
I've always heard that


418
00:42:09.925 --> 00:42:14.691
左手使剑的人身手很敏捷
left-handed men were quite deft.


419
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.089
刺进去的时候
To stab,


420
00:42:18.233 --> 00:42:21.201
剑横着倒向一边
one turns the sword on its side...


421
00:42:21.336 --> 00:42:23.394
像这样
...like this.


422
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.807
从右边刺的话
From the right...


423
00:42:32.814 --> 00:42:35.680
和伤口不吻合
...the wound doesn't match.


424
00:42:36.617 --> 00:42:38.584
但是
But...


425
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.688
用左手的话
...from the left hand...


426
00:42:51.131 --> 00:42:54.588
即使这样
Even so...


427
00:42:55.035 --> 00:42:58.595
这一刺还是被
非常巧妙的完成了
...it was most skillfully done.


428
00:42:58.738 --> 00:43:02.298
简单却巧妙
Simply brilliant.


429
00:43:04.443 --> 00:43:07.673
但是按照纪律
But our rules...


430
00:43:08.614 --> 00:43:13.073
私斗是被禁止的
...strictly forbid private vendettas...


431
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.980
斋藤先生
...Saito-sensei.


432
00:43:19.624 --> 00:43:25.084
这个现场分析是谁告诉你的？
And have you mentioned
these conclusions to anyone?


433
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.493
没有人
No.


434
00:43:33.938 --> 00:43:39.773
你想杀死我吗？
Do you draw against me, sir?


435
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:46.876
我只是想把新选组里
The Shinsengumi,
this death-seeking rabble...


436
00:43:47.017 --> 00:43:51.180
的那些乌合之众
...suits me somehow.


437
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:54.380
扫除掉
Keep out of my way.


438
00:43:54.525 --> 00:43:57.789
这么说吧
Well, then...


439
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:06.592
你给我点钱
...will you give me some money...


440
00:44:07.136 --> 00:44:12.072
作为封口费
...to keep my mouth closed?


441
00:44:21.816 --> 00:44:24.283
为什么你走右边
Why do walk on that side?


442
00:44:24.419 --> 00:44:29.185
我怕您的左边，斋藤君
I'm afraid of your left arm,
Saito-sensei.


443
00:44:29.324 --> 00:44:31.587
我又不会杀你
I won't draw on you.


444
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:37.592
这个是
Does this...


445
00:44:38.632 --> 00:44:41.896
说我们吗？
...mean us?


446
00:44:42.336 --> 00:44:44.701
我们...
Are we...


447
00:44:46.707 --> 00:44:49.470
是“壬生之狼”？
...'the wolves of Mibu'?


448
00:44:57.317 --> 00:44:59.682
在下不胜感激
My humble thanks.


449
00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:05.781
我不要你谢这个
I don't want your thanks.


450
00:45:23.508 --> 00:45:25.873
欢迎
Welcome.


451
00:45:27.913 --> 00:45:30.472
打搅了
I'm sorry to disturb you.


452
00:45:35.019 --> 00:45:38.385
怎么样，恐龙吧？
Not much to look at, huh?


453
00:45:57.007 --> 00:45:58.974
请
Please.


454
00:45:59.209 --> 00:46:01.870
啊，谢谢
Well! Thank you.


455
00:46:02.712 --> 00:46:09.378
我讨厌美女，所谓的“美女”
俗不可耐
I don"t like beautiful women.
Women called 'beautiful' disgust me.


456
00:46:09.518 --> 00:46:13.977
人只不过是比一袋屎强些
After all, none of us is
more than a sack of shit.


457
00:46:40.815 --> 00:46:43.783
它们真漂亮
They be so pretty!


458
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.954
真对不起
I'm truly sorry!


459
00:46:59.399 --> 00:47:01.263
姐姐是出身在
Your accent makes me think
you're from...


460
00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:04.767
奥冈？
Oshu


461
00:47:12.812 --> 00:47:17.475
5年前我一直在北方
I worked all over the north.


462
00:47:19.518 --> 00:47:25.581
后来被卖到一家妓院从泽内到
越池汤泽，然后到了岛原
Then I was sold to a brothel
in Shimabara, here in Kyoto.


463
00:47:26.825 --> 00:47:29.691
哦，是这样啊
I see...


464
00:47:29.828 --> 00:47:32.057
我都不知道这些
I didn't know that.


465
00:47:33.498 --> 00:47:37.763
老公不喜欢听这些废话
'The boss' here doesn't like
people talking too much.


466
00:47:38.103 --> 00:47:43.665
我们谈太多关于你家乡的事了
You can't talk too much
about your home town.


467
00:48:18.306 --> 00:48:21.468
她真美
She's beautiful!


468
00:48:50.004 --> 00:48:54.770
我要结婚了 和附近的一个女孩
I'm getting married...
to a girl from near here.


469
00:48:54.909 --> 00:48:58.571
是吗，你？
You are?


470
00:48:59.012 --> 00:49:01.775
是谁啊？
Who is it?


471
00:49:01.915 --> 00:49:07.477
那个夏日晚会里我们看到的静
Shizu, the girl at the summer festival
we were looking at.


472
00:49:09.722 --> 00:49:12.155
和静？
Shizu?


473
00:49:12.692 --> 00:49:16.650
我对她一见钟情
I fell in love at first sight.


474
00:49:17.596 --> 00:49:20.155
是啊
You did, eh?


475
00:49:23.902 --> 00:49:25.960
我了解了
I see...


476
00:49:26.104 --> 00:49:27.968
笨蛋
Fool!


477
00:49:28.106 --> 00:49:32.064
和平民之女结婚
简直是开玩笑啊
A farmer's daughter?!
Do you mock me?!


478
00:49:32.211 --> 00:49:34.178
如果一个武士娶了她...
If a samurai family adopted her...


479
00:49:34.312 --> 00:49:37.075
如果你喜欢可以娶她做妾
Make her a concubine, if you like.


480
00:49:37.215 --> 00:49:42.777
在你未成婚前
You can keep her until
you make a proper marriage.


481
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.752
这样我们允许
That we will permit.


482
00:49:50.194 --> 00:49:53.560
请停一下
Please stop!


483
00:49:56.499 --> 00:50:02.266
小姐什么事？您要解手？
What is it, Miss?
Do you need to relieve yourself?


484
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.557
喂...
Hey!


485
00:50:26.295 --> 00:50:29.263
你们留在这
You stay here!


486
00:50:30.598 --> 00:50:32.462
喂...
Hey!


487
00:50:50.217 --> 00:50:52.446
大哥
Kanichiro!


488
00:50:53.687 --> 00:50:55.449
静
Shizu!


489
00:51:03.997 --> 00:51:06.556
你在这做什么？
What are you doing here?


490
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:13.363
我只想来这里
This is where I want to be!


491
00:51:13.906 --> 00:51:20.868
我想嫁给你
I want to marry you!


492
00:51:21.013 --> 00:51:23.276
静
Shizu!


493
00:51:24.417 --> 00:51:28.853
- 大哥
- 静...
Kanichiro!
Shizu...


494
00:51:32.791 --> 00:51:37.454
请让那个姑娘回去
Give the girl back, please.


495
00:51:38.997 --> 00:51:41.157
静...
Shizu...


496
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:45.268
要做我的妻子了
...will be my wife!


497
00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:49.167
佐助，回去转告次郎卫这事
Jiroemon won't have her!
Go tell him that, Sasuke!


498
00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:52.668
你不能这样
You can't do that!


499
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.370
从今天起...
From this day on...


500
00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:59.240
你就是我的妻子了
...you are my wife.


501
00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:06.051
我不会让任何人碰你一指头
I won't let anyone lay
a finger on you!


502
00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:13.352
- 静
- 大哥
Shizu!
Kanichiro!


503
00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:23.561
我从江户收到非正式的通知
I have received
unofficial notification from Edo.


504
00:52:23.705 --> 00:52:26.366
我们新选组...
We of the Shinsengumi


505
00:52:26.508 --> 00:52:30.170
将直接受雇于幕府本人
are to be made direct retainers
of the Shogun himself!


506
00:52:34.182 --> 00:52:37.639
我们必须忠于职守
We must look to our task.


507
00:52:37.886 --> 00:52:41.651
效忠幕府，效忠德川家族
We must preserve
the authority of the Shogun...


508
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:44.655
没有二话
...and his Tokugawa family!


509
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.960
近藤先生
Kondo-sensei...


510
00:52:55.503 --> 00:53:02.567
你现在说的这些都是真的吗？
You say that we are to be
made hatamoto? Is this true?


511
00:53:02.709 --> 00:53:04.369
是
Yes.


512
00:53:04.511 --> 00:53:06.239
吉村君...
Yoshimura...


513
00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.340
你有什么不满吗？
does this displease you?


514
00:53:09.682 --> 00:53:11.546
没有
No!


515
00:53:12.085 --> 00:53:16.453
完全没有
No.
Not at all.


516
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:23.952
冒昧的问一下
Um... may I ask a foolish question?


517
00:53:25.597 --> 00:53:30.363
津贴的话，我们多少可以拿一些吧？
Will we receive payment
appropriate to this honor?


518
00:53:30.502 --> 00:53:33.061
津贴？
Payment?!


519
00:53:39.377 --> 00:53:42.345
吉村君你现在是“诸士调役兼监察”
'All personnel to rank as "Inspector".'


520
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.744
你可以得到40袋大米
You will earn 40 bags of rice.


521
00:53:46.084 --> 00:53:48.156
40袋？
Forty?!


522
00:53:48.156 --> 00:53:50.351
是的，40袋
Yes. Forty.


523
00:53:55.193 --> 00:53:58.059
谢谢
Thank you!


524
00:53:59.396 --> 00:54:01.056
近藤先生

528

530
00:54:18.681 --> 00:54:22.548
真是感谢啊
吉村先生
My humble thanks, too,

531
00:54:28.991 --> 00:54:32.050

532
00:54:34.095 --> 00:54:37.063
真是感谢啊
...my humble thanks!


533
00:54:58.385 --> 00:55:03.651
喂，中间的先生不要动
The gentleman in the middle...
don't move. Stay still.


534
00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:05.256
屏住呼吸
Hold your breath!


535
00:55:05.392 --> 00:55:09.555
1 2 3
One, two, three...


536
00:55:09.696 --> 00:55:16.658
4 5 6 7 8 9 10
...four, five, six, seven...
...eight, nine, ten.


537
00:55:17.203 --> 00:55:20.433
唉，好了
辛苦了
Well done. That's it.


538
00:55:20.573 --> 00:55:23.735
下面那位来拍啊？
Who's next for a photograph?


539
00:55:23.976 --> 00:55:26.288
吉村君
Yoshimura!


540
00:55:26.288 --> 00:55:26.777
嗯？
Yes?


541
00:55:26.779 --> 00:55:31.238
拍张照，家里人都会开心的
Have a picture taken.
They'll love it back home.


542
00:55:31.383 --> 00:55:35.341
不了，不行啊
No, no, thank you.


543
00:55:35.487 --> 00:55:39.149
别担心
我们来付帐
Don't worry. We'll pay for it.


544
00:55:40.392 --> 00:55:43.656
这么说的话...
Well, if you say so...


545
00:55:46.798 --> 00:55:49.664
什么？
我一个人？
What, only me?


546
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.524
- 大人
- 就你一个吧
Gentlemen!
Just you.


547
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.637
近藤先生
斋藤先生
Kondo-sensei! Saito-sensei!


548
00:55:54.772 --> 00:55:56.033
像这样
Like this.


549
00:55:56.173 --> 00:56:00.836
直直的站着，不要动啊
Stand still. Just bear with it.


550
00:56:01.278 --> 00:56:03.142
不要动
屏住呼吸
Don't move!
Hold your breath.


551
00:56:03.881 --> 00:56:07.941
1 2 3...
One, two, three...


552
00:56:23.199 --> 00:56:27.328
你们要搬到哪里？
Where are you moving to?


553
00:56:27.469 --> 00:56:29.629
满洲
Manchuria.


554
00:56:31.073 --> 00:56:33.336
啊
那非常的远啊
China? That's a long way away.


555
00:56:33.475 --> 00:56:35.032
是啊
Yes.


556
00:56:51.092 --> 00:56:56.256
这个时候新选组开始
分裂成两派
By this time the Shinsengumi
had split into two factions.


557
00:56:56.397 --> 00:57:00.127
整个日本也分裂了，幕府势力
和萨长各藩战斗着…
So had Japan, as the Shogun's forces
fought the southwestern clans...


558
00:57:00.268 --> 00:57:05.034
开始互相你争我夺
...who wished the Emperor to rule.


559
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:07.138
这是一种潮流
This was a tide


560
00:57:07.274 --> 00:57:09.741
- 新选组也无法抗拒这种潮流
- 吉村君
the Shinsengumi could not resist.
Yoshimura!


561
00:57:09.876 --> 00:57:11.342
啊
Yes?


562
00:57:11.878 --> 00:57:16.644
今晚 有空吗？
到舍下来有正事商量
Could I ask for some of
your time tonight? It's important.


563
00:57:17.684 --> 00:57:19.241
好的
Certainly.


564
00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:27.956
这里就好
退下
This is fine. Leave us.


565
00:57:31.597 --> 00:57:34.827
我们的任务是保护朝廷
Our task is to guard the Court.


566
00:57:34.967 --> 00:57:38.424
我们要向幕府效忠
Our loyalty lays with the Emperor.


567
00:57:40.272 --> 00:57:43.536
在近藤下面辅佐
Under Squire Kondo


568
00:57:43.675 --> 00:57:46.837
我们不过是条狗
we are no more than the
Tokugawa Shogun's dogs.


569
00:57:47.879 --> 00:57:54.841
在国家动乱的这个时期
我只能认为这是个错误
In this time of upheaval in the land,
I cannot but think that is a mistake.


570
00:57:55.286 --> 00:58:01.053
我们该脱离新选组
We thus take leave of the Shinsengumi.


571
00:58:01.191 --> 00:58:04.057
我并不吃惊
I wasn't surprised.


572
00:58:04.194 --> 00:58:08.527
狐狸就是狐狸，狗就是狗
这些都是借口
A fox thinks for itself,
while a dog simply follows.


573
00:58:08.665 --> 00:58:12.225
我们希望你们加入
We want you with us!


574
00:58:12.369 --> 00:58:15.929
我们需要你们手中的剑
We need your swords!


575
00:58:16.073 --> 00:58:19.940
我们会被当作御陵卫士来迎接
We'll be appointed Imperial Guards.


576
00:58:20.076 --> 00:58:25.536
俸禄方面也比幕府多
就这么约定吧
We promise you twice what you get
as Shogun's hatamoto.


577
00:58:25.681 --> 00:58:31.346
也不是说马上就要决定
We're not asking you to decide now.


578
00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:42.224
对我来说我已经背叛过一次了
By leaving my clan,
I have already failed one lord.


579
00:58:42.364 --> 00:58:44.923
决不能有第二次
I will not betray the trust of another.


580
00:58:45.066 --> 00:58:48.432
吉村
斋藤
Yoshimura... Mr. Saito...


581
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:53.131
在我看来幕府已经完了
...as I see it,
the Tokugawa Shogunate is dead.


582
00:58:53.274 --> 00:58:57.539
背叛也没什么特别的
长州部的桂 土佐部的坂本已经完全...
Others have left... Katsura, from Choshu,
and Sakamoto, from Tosa...


583
00:58:57.678 --> 00:58:59.042
不！
No!


584
00:59:01.682 --> 00:59:03.342
我不行
I cannot.


585
00:59:05.185 --> 00:59:08.745
吉村
考虑一下你的将来
Yoshimura! Think of the future!


586
00:59:08.889 --> 00:59:11.721
我对此也感到意外
I was surprised, too,


587
00:59:11.859 --> 00:59:14.827
那个吉村居然不为金钱所动...
that money
would not sway Yoshimura.


588
00:59:15.461 --> 00:59:17.428
（武士的耻辱）
You're not fit to be samurai!


589
00:59:17.563 --> 00:59:19.120
（背信弃义）
You have an obligation!


590
00:59:19.265 --> 00:59:22.233
- 不知廉耻
- 筱原君！
You're a disgrace!
Mr. Shinohara!


591
00:59:22.969 --> 00:59:25.232
滚出京都去
Get out of Kyoto!


592
00:59:26.172 --> 00:59:30.335
我决定和伊东走
I decided to go with Ito...


593
00:59:31.277 --> 00:59:36.043
但是，是作为近藤和士方的间谍
...but as an informer
for Kondo and Hljikata.


594
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:39.750
大久保大人
Squire Okubo,


595
00:59:39.885 --> 00:59:42.250
我们必须先除掉妨碍萨长的人
we must remove
those who are disloyal...


596
00:59:42.387 --> 00:59:44.354
的确如此
...to the Emperor.


597
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:51.024
那些不识时务的人
Indeed. Those who can't see
where the times are headed...


598
00:59:51.163 --> 00:59:53.824
真是障碍啊
...are in our way.


599
00:59:55.466 --> 00:59:57.933
除掉近藤和士方
Without Kondo and Hijikata,


600
00:59:58.068 --> 01:00:00.934
新选组就会崩溃
the Shinsengumi will collapse.


601
01:00:01.572 --> 01:00:06.838
伊东君这个说起来容易啊...
That's easy to say, Mr. Ito.


602
01:00:07.978 --> 01:00:09.740
除非...
Unless...


603
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:14.142
斋藤君帮忙
...Mr. Saito helps.


604
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.924
我很受信赖
They were counting on me.


605
01:00:27.063 --> 01:00:31.123
伊东 萨摩的大久保都是一样的狐狸
Ito was a fox. So was Okubo,
of Satsuma, in the southwest.


606
01:00:31.266 --> 01:00:34.894
狐狸是敌不过狼的
They knew a wolf
when they saw one.


607
01:00:35.771 --> 01:00:39.137
“我戴着家族的饰章…”
'I wear a family crest...


608
01:00:39.274 --> 01:00:42.936
“妈妈常开玩笑的说…”
'Mother often speaks in jest...


609
01:00:43.078 --> 01:00:46.444
“而爸爸等了又等…”
'And Father da-dum da-dum...


610
01:00:46.582 --> 01:00:50.142
“姐姐上下打量着客人…
'Elder Sister makes eyes at the guest...


611
01:00:50.284 --> 01:00:53.309
小妹 ...
'...and Little Sister...


612
01:00:54.255 --> 01:00:58.714
“变成了一个害人虫”
'...is being a pest.'


613
01:01:13.673 --> 01:01:14.934
当心点
Be careful.


614
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.337
恩，主人
Hey 'Boss'...


615
01:01:43.269 --> 01:01:45.236
说起来讽刺
It was Yoshimura's job


616
01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:49.237
我托付的密信
to pass my messages to Hijikata.


617
01:01:49.374 --> 01:01:51.637
能传给士方靠的是吉村
That was ironic.


618
01:01:52.377 --> 01:01:57.837
让你做这么危险的事
真是感激不尽
I'm sorry a woman has to do
such dangerous work.


619
01:01:57.982 --> 01:02:04.716
完全没有觉得危险啊
我喜欢做这事
It doesn't frighten me at all.
I'm happy to do it.


620
01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:14.928
啊，我这里有些团子
Have some of these dumplings.
I love them.


621
01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:18.830
啊，我也喜欢
我吃了
Well! That's good.
So do I!


622
01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:20.936
谢谢
Thank you.


623
01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:27.731
一个女人能帮上丈夫的忙
Just the thought that a woman
like me can help...


624
01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:32.904
让我感到充满力量
...makes me feel strong inside.


625
01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:42.418
在岛原我们第一次遇到
第二天
When we first met in Shimabara
he came back the next day...


626
01:02:42.557 --> 01:02:48.927
她就把我从窑子里买出来
...and bought out
my contract from the brothel.


627
01:02:50.465 --> 01:02:53.024
她说我丑
I'm proud when he says


628
01:02:53.168 --> 01:02:56.432
我觉得很骄傲
I'm not much to look at.


629
01:03:00.474 --> 01:03:07.106
我家里人全因饥荒死去
My family all starved in the famine.


630
01:03:07.247 --> 01:03:12.013
现在身边就只有我老公
He's the only one
who's ever stood by me.


631
01:03:12.853 --> 01:03:16.515
他一直照顾我
He took pity on me.


632
01:03:17.157 --> 01:03:19.818
呵呵，是这样啊
He did, eh?


633
01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.928
请啊
不了，我不要...
Have some.
I'm fine, thanks.


634
01:03:26.566 --> 01:03:29.932
伊东他们暗杀近藤的计划
I passed on Ito's plot...


635
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:35.631
以及刺杀坂本龙马的企图
因为他反对使用武力倒幕
...to kill Kondo, and even Ryoma Sakamoto,
who was against using force...


636
01:03:35.775 --> 01:03:37.742
我都密信传去
...to topple the Shogun.


637
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:45.713
有意思啊
Very interesting.


638
01:03:51.356 --> 01:03:53.323
杀了伊东
Kill Ito.


639
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:12.599
其实是我不想杀近藤
想杀别人而已
Of course I couldn't kill Kondo,
so I killed their other target.


640
01:04:15.245 --> 01:04:19.203
您辛苦了
Welcome home.


641
01:04:22.252 --> 01:04:24.719
离新选组远些
Keep away from the Shinsengumi.


642
01:04:24.854 --> 01:04:27.219
吉村也不要见了
Don't see Yoshimura again.


643
01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:30.823
我马上要躲起来
I've got to hide out.


644
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.621
你也早点离开这里
You get out of here, too.


645
01:04:38.367 --> 01:04:42.427
为什么非要离开这里？
Why do I have to go?


646
01:04:43.372 --> 01:04:49.207
我做了太多危险的事
不被杀才怪
I've taken a big chance.
I'll be lucky to come out alive.


647
01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:54.406
你和我一起也要受到连累
If you're with me,
they'll come after you, too.


648
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:56.607
这是...
This...


649
01:04:56.751 --> 01:04:59.014
分别的礼物
...is a farewell gift.


650
01:05:00.154 --> 01:05:03.020
我不在乎
我要在留在这里
I don't care. I'm staying.


651
01:05:03.157 --> 01:05:05.624
我不想你被杀掉
I don't want you getting killed!


652
01:05:08.563 --> 01:05:10.530
再见了
Goodbye.


653
01:05:13.366 --> 01:05:18.132
我不要这样
I don't want this.


654
01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.899
命要紧啊
Think of yourself!


655
01:05:28.248 --> 01:05:34.709
你说的话我很明白
I understand perfectly
what you're saying.


656
01:05:35.855 --> 01:05:40.917
但是我什么都不需要
But I don't need anything from you.


657
01:05:43.362 --> 01:05:45.420
相反
Instead...


658
01:05:46.165 --> 01:05:48.724
今晚...
...tonight...


659
01:05:50.015 --> 01:05:51.845
…和我做爱吧
...make love to me.


660
01:06:04.596 --> 01:06:05.892
抱住我…
Hold me...


661
01:06:07.399 --> 01:06:09.059
求你了
...please.


662
01:06:53.775 --> 01:06:54.832
发生了什么事？
What happened?


663
01:06:54.943 --> 01:06:56.739
阪本龙马被杀了！
Ryoma Sakamoto's been killed!


664
01:06:56.845 --> 01:06:57.936
什么？
What?


665
01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:03.116
龙马被杀了，我并不兴奋
I wasn't excited about
who had assassinated Ryoma.


666
01:07:03.951 --> 01:07:07.886
我比任何一个人
都清楚是谁杀了他
Better than anyone, I knew who had.


667
01:07:31.345 --> 01:07:33.004
有人吗？
Hello?


668
01:07:34.155 --> 01:07:35.414
佐野小姐？
Miss Nui?


669
01:07:38.424 --> 01:07:40.683
打扰了
May I come in?


670
01:07:47.033 --> 01:07:48.432
佐野小姐？
Miss Nui?


671
01:08:01.471 --> 01:08:02.370
佐野…
Miss...


672
01:08:11.979 --> 01:08:13.318
…小姐！
Miss Nui!


673
01:08:30.696 --> 01:08:31.665
静！
Shizu!


674
01:08:33.206 --> 01:08:34.185
静！
Shizu!


675
01:08:49.713 --> 01:08:50.942
静！
Shizu!


676
01:08:59.662 --> 01:09:04.321
你是武士的妻子
不许你自杀
A samurai's wife can't kill herself
so there's one less mouth to feed!


677
01:09:04.661 --> 01:09:06.250
放开我！
Let me go!


678
01:09:07.501 --> 01:09:08.790
静！
Shizu!


679
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.969
让我去！
Let me die!


680
01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:12.929
静！
Shizu!


681
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.929
静！你不能！
Shizu! You can't!


682
01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:20.138
你不能这样做！
You can't do this!


683
01:09:21.539 --> 01:09:22.738
还是…
All right...


684
01:09:24.448 --> 01:09:27.377
让我死掉当食物吧！
...let me die and use me for food!


685
01:09:29.717 --> 01:09:31.116
我不能…
I can't...


686
01:09:32.387 --> 01:09:35.586
再给你增加负担！
...go on bringing you trouble!


687
01:09:45.895 --> 01:09:47.624
静！
Shizu!


688
01:09:49.564 --> 01:09:52.463
父亲！
Father!


689
01:09:53.374 --> 01:09:56.103
不要责怪母亲！
Don't be angry at Mother!


690
01:09:56.773 --> 01:10:01.902
我不饿！我不需要吃饭！
I'm not hungry! I don't need to eat!


691
01:10:08.551 --> 01:10:10.110
我不会…
I won't...


692
01:10:12.181 --> 01:10:14.850
我不会让你再有这种想法了
...let this happen to you again.


693
01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.549
你们是我的一切
I owe my loyalty to you.


694
01:10:23.329 --> 01:10:25.228
谁也比不上
And no one else.


695
01:10:32.938 --> 01:10:35.337
作为孩子们的老师…
As a teacher of children...


696
01:10:37.207 --> 01:10:40.036
和一个剑术教练…
...and a fencing instructor...


697
01:10:41.176 --> 01:10:47.665
但我不能向任何人要钱
...it's impossible for me to go
begging for money here in Morioka.


698
01:10:48.045 --> 01:10:51.574
但我知道…
But I know full well...


699
01:10:54.014 --> 01:10:58.783
如果没有钱，你们
都活不过这个冬天
...that without money none of you
will live through the winter.


700
01:11:12.631 --> 01:11:13.890
嘉一郎…
Kaichiro...


701
01:11:16.331 --> 01:11:17.560
御津…
Mitsu...


702
01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.299
虽然我可能会…
Though I might...


703
01:11:28.249 --> 01:11:31.038
离乡背井的去谋生…
...abandon my clan to earn my living...


704
01:11:33.348 --> 01:11:37.907
但我永远不会抛弃你们的
...I will never abandon you.


705
01:11:54.165 --> 01:11:55.324
静…
Shizu...


706
01:11:57.235 --> 01:12:00.834
好好照顾肚里的孩子
...look after the new baby
when it comes.


707
01:12:05.743 --> 01:12:06.172
贯一郎…
Kanichiro...


708
01:12:06.273 --> 01:12:07.472
不！
No!


709
01:12:09.213 --> 01:12:12.202
不要说了，在我们不知道的时候
你悄悄地离开这里吧
It has to seem like
I left without telling you.


710
01:12:13.282 --> 01:12:15.581
送别的话就不说了
We can't have words of farewell!


711
01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:24.979
那…
So...


712
01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:28.059
我走了
...I'm going.


713
01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.519
老公！
Kanichiro!


714
01:12:44.707 --> 01:12:46.796
父亲！父亲！
Father! Father!


715
01:12:52.986 --> 01:12:54.315
父亲…
Father...


716
01:12:56.155 --> 01:12:59.604
不要送我，你回去！
Go home! You mustn't see me off!


717
01:13:01.385 --> 01:13:03.114
我不是送你
I won't.


718
01:13:04.094 --> 01:13:08.553
只是…再抱一次御津吧
Only just... hold Mitsu one last time.


719
01:13:09.933 --> 01:13:13.762
和她最喜欢的父亲做个告别
She doesn't deserve to have
the father she loves...


720
01:13:14.303 --> 01:13:15.862
御津也不会太可怜
...go without a word.


721
01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:26.270
爸爸…
Papa...


722
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:29.979
爸爸…
Papa...


723
01:13:43.328 --> 01:13:44.687
爸爸…
Papa...


724
01:14:13.684 --> 01:14:14.583
御津…
Mitsu...


725
01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:19.582
御津…
Mitsu...


726
01:14:19.693 --> 01:14:21.092
爸爸…
Papa...


727
01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:23.951
御津…
Mitsu...


728
01:14:39.969 --> 01:14:43.428
父亲，不要哭
Father, please don't cry.


729
01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:51.107
父亲你走好
多保重啊！
I only wish your departure
were a happier one.


730
01:15:29.912 --> 01:15:31.811
斋藤大人回来了！
Squire Saito returns!


731
01:15:32.781 --> 01:15:33.770
斋藤先生吗？
Saito-sensei?


732
01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:34.580
为什么？
Why?


733
01:15:34.681 --> 01:15:35.710
我不知道
I don't know.


734
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.789
斋藤大人！
Squire Saito!


735
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:43.549
一边去！
Stand aside!


736
01:15:45.159 --> 01:15:50.528
躲躲藏藏像个白痴一样
我满不在乎地回到了新选组
I was tired of hiding out.
I went back to the Shinsengumi...


737
01:15:51.428 --> 01:15:56.627
我也知道新选组快完蛋了
...though I knew perfectly well
how bedraggled it had become.


738
01:15:57.068 --> 01:16:00.197
这也正是我回来的所有原因
That was all the more reason
for me to return.


739
01:16:08.846 --> 01:16:14.045
让您做这么难的事
酬劳方面好说
My sympathies for
the unpleasant task that fell to you.


740
01:16:14.415 --> 01:16:16.584
我不需要酬劳
I don't need your sympathy.


741
01:16:17.025 --> 01:16:18.184
让开
Move.


742
01:16:23.494 --> 01:16:24.423
斋藤先生…
Saito-sensei...


743
01:16:32.872 --> 01:16:34.331
佐野小姐…
Miss Nui...


744
01:16:36.672 --> 01:16:38.301
她怎么了？
What about her?


745
01:16:42.081 --> 01:16:44.100
她自杀了
She killed herself.


746
01:17:00.058 --> 01:17:01.357
啊，是吗？
I see.


747
01:17:02.897 --> 01:17:08.886
恕我冒昧，我把她安葬在光缘寺
I took the liberty of arranging
a funeral at Koenji Temple.


748
01:17:11.536 --> 01:17:13.295
真是多余
Mind your own business.


749
01:17:16.805 --> 01:17:21.364
就是在那个时候…
Right then only he knew...


750
01:17:22.075 --> 01:17:24.014
只有他才知道我内心深处的想法
...my innermost thoughts.


751
01:19:00.089 --> 01:19:01.718
你要杀了我吗？
You're going to kill me?


752
01:19:03.399 --> 01:19:07.028
你什么志气都没有
不过一个乡下武士
A country samurai
who doesn't care what happens?


753
01:19:08.668 --> 01:19:11.537
只要有点小钱
其它的都无所谓了吧
Doesn't anything matter
as long as you get paid?


754
01:19:12.807 --> 01:19:14.706
你这个守财奴
Money-grubber!


755
01:19:17.037 --> 01:19:18.566
要杀人的贯一
Mercenary!


756
01:19:20.076 --> 01:19:22.165
你杀我能拿多少啊？
How much are they paying you
to kill me?!


757
01:19:50.602 --> 01:19:52.531
我很抱歉
I'm truly sorry.


758
01:20:51.452 --> 01:20:52.941
我们的好日子
It was all...


759
01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:56.051
在那时到头了
...downhill from there.


760
01:20:57.091 --> 01:21:01.390
听从复古还朝的旨意 我不再
作为京都的幕府 我把朝政奉还
The Shogun resigned, and political
power returned to the Emperor.


761
01:21:01.491 --> 01:21:03.260
会津老爷，京都大名也离开了...
The Lord of Aizu,
Commissioner of Kyoto...


762
01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.429
我们也就没有什么可护卫的了
...was relieved of his post,
leaving us with nothing to guard.


763
01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.898
冲田最终死于肺结核
Okita was dying of tuberculosis...


764
01:21:13.169 --> 01:21:18.508
近藤总长被伊东派的残党
筱原暗杀
...and Shinohara, of the Ito faction,
had shot Kondo.


765
01:21:19.878 --> 01:21:25.647
无依无靠的新选组
As if seeking its last stand,
the Shinsengumi joined in the fight...


766
01:21:26.017 --> 01:21:29.006
像是上演落幕高潮的场面一样
...against the southwestern clans.


767
01:21:29.916 --> 01:21:34.285
我们加入了幕府同萨长的战斗
我们所能做的就只有战斗
Fighting was all we could do.


768
01:21:36.595 --> 01:21:37.754
大野大人…
Squire Ono...


769
01:21:48.933 --> 01:21:52.372
新选组，加油！努力！加油！
直起要来，挺起胸膛！
Straighten your backs!
Stick out your chests!


770
01:21:52.973 --> 01:21:55.602
我们是壬生的战士！
We are the warriors of Mibu!


771
01:22:05.781 --> 01:22:07.440
新选组！
Shinsengumi!


772
01:22:14.659 --> 01:22:16.118
祝你好运！
Good on you!


773
01:22:18.899 --> 01:22:20.228
新选组！
Shinsengumi!


774
01:22:21.058 --> 01:22:23.287
你们的衣装都穿好了吗？
Are you properly dressed?


775
01:22:24.468 --> 01:22:28.197
检查你们的武器
If your clothing isn't good and tight,
you will die!


776
01:22:30.807 --> 01:22:34.736
即使倒下了，
也不能丢下手中的剑！
Even if you fall,
do not drop your sword!


777
01:22:35.506 --> 01:22:37.535
狠狠的打击他们
Keep swinging it!


778
01:22:38.976 --> 01:22:44.005
如果你一息尚存，也要抓住机会
If you're out of breath,
grab your opponent.


779
01:22:45.615 --> 01:22:49.554
用任何方法…
Use any means you can...


780
01:22:50.854 --> 01:22:52.683
活着归来
...and come back alive.


781
01:23:00.292 --> 01:23:01.281
他们来了！
They're coming!


782
01:23:01.392 --> 01:23:04.121
会津新选组的决死队来了！
The Shinsengumi's here!


783
01:23:06.601 --> 01:23:07.960
冲啊！
Charge!


784
01:23:09.441 --> 01:23:10.560
开炮！
Fire!


785
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:16.439
前进！
Forward!


786
01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:20.139
开火！
Fire!


787
01:23:27.648 --> 01:23:33.347
想起来真是好笑，以剑对枪
胜负自然不言而喻
It was ludicrous. Swords against guns,
a foregone conclusion.


788
01:23:34.287 --> 01:23:37.126
用剑拼命的事
The day of the sword...


789
01:23:37.697 --> 01:23:40.526
已经是过去时了
...was already far in the past.


790
01:23:42.666 --> 01:23:46.655
南部盛冈家族 大阪货栈
Nanbu Clan godown, Osaka


791
01:23:47.965 --> 01:23:49.264
报告！
Reporting!


792
01:23:51.435 --> 01:23:56.874
幕府的队伍溃败
The Shogun's forces are retreating.
The southwestern army...


793
01:23:56.974 --> 01:23:58.743
萨长的军队穷追不舍
他们还再死战
...is in pursuit.


794
01:24:00.013 --> 01:24:02.142
萨长的军队赢了？
They're winning?


795
01:24:02.453 --> 01:24:03.542
是的，先生
Yes, sir.


796
01:24:04.683 --> 01:24:07.452
新选组也无力回天？
The Shinsengumi's no help?


797
01:24:08.952 --> 01:24:10.081
“新选组”？
'Shinsengumi'?


798
01:24:12.921 --> 01:24:14.050
没什么
Nothing.


799
01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.959
我们和幕府的队伍一起败退
We fled with the Shogun's troops.


800
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:25.589
其它部族也相继倒戈
The other clans deserted us.


801
01:24:26.099 --> 01:24:32.558
终于我们已经被追到了悬崖边缘
伏击成了我们最后的赌注
On the edge of annihilation,
we played our final card.


802
01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:35.837
你没事吧？
You all right?


803
01:24:37.577 --> 01:24:39.446
吃点儿吧
Have some food.


804
01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:44.216
来吧，吃点儿
Go on, eat.


805
01:24:49.326 --> 01:24:51.485
慢点儿吃！
Eat slowly!


806
01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.414
斋藤先生…
Saito-sensei...


807
01:25:01.164 --> 01:25:06.293
我找会津的百姓
分了我们一些食物
I got the Aizu people
to share their supplies with us.


808
01:25:08.433 --> 01:25:09.492
吃吧…
Please...


809
01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:28.949
你吃过了吗？
Have you eaten?


810
01:25:29.889 --> 01:25:31.248
这个…
Uh...


811
01:25:32.129 --> 01:25:33.288
…没
...no.


812
01:25:36.398 --> 01:25:37.517
那是最后一个？
Was that the last?


813
01:25:41.668 --> 01:25:46.497
你为什么不先告诉我！
我吃的是最后一个饭团！
Why didn't you say?!
You let me eat the last one!


814
01:25:47.437 --> 01:25:50.636
我习惯了
I'm used to being hungry.


815
01:25:51.036 --> 01:25:54.495
这点足够了!
This'll do me fine.


816
01:25:58.275 --> 01:25:59.644
你这混蛋！
You bastard!


817
01:26:00.785 --> 01:26:04.184
我...我最厌恶你
I hate your guts!


818
01:26:04.854 --> 01:26:08.113
为什么一个屎袋要关心
别人的肚子
Why should one shit-sack care
if another's full?!


819
01:26:08.453 --> 01:26:12.112
在一个人人
互相仇杀的世界里…
In a world where men hate enough
to kill each other...


820
01:26:12.493 --> 01:26:15.892
你为什么却要管我
是不是填饱了肚子！
...why are you trying
to fill my stomach?!


821
01:26:15.992 --> 01:26:18.151
斋藤先生！
Saito-sensei!


822
01:26:18.262 --> 01:26:20.661
我喘不过气来了！
I can't breathe!


823
01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:33.939
吉村…离开这儿
Yoshimura... get out of here.


824
01:26:37.079 --> 01:26:39.098
不管我们是否愿意…
We're going to die here...


825
01:26:40.249 --> 01:26:42.908
我们就要死在这里了
...whether we like it or not.


826
01:26:44.818 --> 01:26:48.807
但我不想你死
But I don't want you to.


827
01:26:50.127 --> 01:26:52.586
不想一个像你这样的人死
Not a man like you.


828
01:27:00.665 --> 01:27:01.754
斋藤…
Mr. Saito...


829
01:27:11.774 --> 01:27:13.143
我是…
I am...


830
01:27:14.843 --> 01:27:17.332
一名南部的武士
...a Nanbu samurai.


831
01:27:28.891 --> 01:27:31.050
南部的武士…
A Nanbu samurai...


832
01:27:32.691 --> 01:27:37.100
南部的武士
不会因为妻儿而背信弃义
...lets neither wife nor child
sway him from his duty.


833
01:27:39.399 --> 01:27:44.628
如果南部打仗的话
我会第一个加入战斗
When Nanbu fights,
I will be there first.


834
01:27:48.038 --> 01:27:54.636
你对我的关心…
我真的很感动
I'm truly grateful for
the consideration you've shown me...


835
01:27:56.777 --> 01:28:02.446
但我决不会...
背离我的责任
...but I will never turn my back
on my duty.


836
01:28:03.716 --> 01:28:05.045
吉村！
Yoshimura!


837
01:28:12.964 --> 01:28:14.453
斋藤先生…
Saito-sensei...


838
01:28:17.394 --> 01:28:19.223
在下不胜感激
...my humble thanks.


839
01:28:23.933 --> 01:28:26.962
他是一个真正的武士
He was a true samurai.


840
01:29:05.766 --> 01:29:07.495
有敌人！
The enemy!


841
01:29:13.635 --> 01:29:15.164
我们遭到攻击！
We're under attack!


842
01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:56.698
不要开枪！
Hold your fire!


843
01:30:02.207 --> 01:30:04.736
收起你们的枪！
Stop shooting!


844
01:30:05.377 --> 01:30:06.246
用剑！
Swords!


845
01:30:44.781 --> 01:30:46.750
为了活命而战！
Fight or die!


846
01:30:59.989 --> 01:31:02.788
杀，继续杀！
Cut them down!


847
01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:15.565
撤退！
Retreat!


848
01:31:16.176 --> 01:31:18.075
撤退！快撤退！
Retreat! Retreat!


849
01:31:23.515 --> 01:31:26.314
前进！
Forward!


850
01:32:20.966 --> 01:32:23.325
天皇的旗帜！
The Emperor's standard!


851
01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:30.264
我们是陛下的军队！
撤回你们的队伍！
We are the Imperial Army!
Withdraw your soldiers!


852
01:32:30.975 --> 01:32:35.604
否则作为反叛者不能赦免
There will be no mercy for rebels!


853
01:32:36.304 --> 01:32:39.003
我们是叛军吗！
Are we rebels now?!


854
01:32:42.143 --> 01:32:44.302
撤退！
Withdraw!


855
01:32:44.652 --> 01:32:47.641
撤退！不要反抗！
Withdraw!! Don't resist!


856
01:32:48.152 --> 01:32:50.171
不要反抗！撤退！
Don't resist! Withdraw!


857
01:32:50.282 --> 01:32:53.151
土方先生！
我们是叛军吗？
Hijikata-sensei! Are we rebels?


858
01:32:54.991 --> 01:32:56.080
嗨！
Hey!
Stand your ground!


859
01:32:56.221 --> 01:32:57.210
坚守阵地！
Stay here,


860
01:32:57.331 --> 01:32:59.520
听我的，待在那里别动！
I said!


861
01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:23.206
我是新选组的
贯一郎 吉村！
I am Kanichiro Yoshimura
of the Shinsengumi!


862
01:33:23.646 --> 01:33:26.445
我效力于德川幕府！
I serve the Tokugawa Shogun!


863
01:33:27.316 --> 01:33:32.045
但我并不想举起双臂反对
一人之上万人之下的天皇…
I do not wish to raise my arm
against His Majesty the Emperor...


864
01:33:33.025 --> 01:33:37.454
但我的职责告诉我要战斗！
...but my duty bids me fight!


865
01:33:38.794 --> 01:33:40.453
我跟你们拼了！
I stand against you!


866
01:33:50.072 --> 01:33:51.061
吉村！
Yoshimura!


867
01:33:56.441 --> 01:33:57.870
不要送死！
Don't die!


868
01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:04.939
吉村！
Yoshimura!


869
01:34:09.449 --> 01:34:10.818
吉村！
Yoshimura!


870
01:34:12.459 --> 01:34:15.518
不要去死，吉村！
Don't die. Yoshimura!


871
01:34:17.228 --> 01:34:18.627
吉村！
Yoshimura!


872
01:34:20.258 --> 01:34:21.727
吉村！
Yoshimura!


873
01:34:22.527 --> 01:34:24.156
吉村！
Yoshimura!


874
01:34:26.697 --> 01:34:28.166
吉村…
Yoshimura...


875
01:34:39.945 --> 01:34:44.344
吉村先生你认识啊？
So you knew Yoshimura-sensei...


876
01:34:56.162 --> 01:35:02.261
他大概最终死于
鸟羽伏见之战…
I assume he died at
the Battle of Toba-Fushimi...


877
01:35:06.001 --> 01:35:06.800
不
No.


878
01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.829
什么，他难道没事吗？
What, is he alive?!


879
01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.608
就像你知道的 那次战斗之后…
After that battle...


880
01:35:21.018 --> 01:35:25.577
形势已完全倾斜于萨长一边
...the war went in favor of
the southwestern clans.


881
01:35:26.548 --> 01:35:30.987
我父亲，大野次郎右卫门…
My father, Jiroemon Ono...


882
01:35:31.357 --> 01:35:34.986
被派往大阪…
...had been sent to Osaka...


883
01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:41.395
去作货栈负责人
他要带领家族渡过危机
...as godown manager, to steer
the clan through the crisis.


884
01:35:41.495 --> 01:35:42.464
报告
Leave to speak!


885
01:35:43.135 --> 01:35:45.324
幕府的指挥大阪的德川庆喜大人
His Lordship the Shogun...


886
01:35:45.435 --> 01:35:50.704
已经离开大阪城，
丢下他的军队乘船逃亡江户了
...has fled Osaka Castle,
left his army and taken ship for Edo.


887
01:35:51.374 --> 01:35:55.673
胜败的形势已经一目了然！
我们该依附于谁也很明显！
We know who's going to win now.
The way forward is clear!


888
01:35:56.043 --> 01:35:59.342
我们要么加入萨长的军队
We can either join the Emperor
and his southwestern clans...


889
01:35:59.442 --> 01:36:01.841
要么和德川幕府一起被毁灭！
...or be destroyed
with the Tokugawas!


890
01:36:01.952 --> 01:36:03.141
就是这样！
I agree!


891
01:36:03.382 --> 01:36:05.211
冷静一点
Calm down...


892
01:36:05.652 --> 01:36:08.981
我们动摇了
下边的也会跟着
...or the lower castes
will get excited as well.


893
01:36:10.121 --> 01:36:15.060
关键的是我们只要有饭吃
就应该保持中立
It is important that
we remain absolutely neutral.


894
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:17.459
我们不能支持任何一方
We must not take sides.


895
01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:21.729
我们要保持像以往的衣食住行
同时也要加强戒备
All we need do is dress normally
and strengthen our gate.


896
01:36:22.929 --> 01:36:25.628
我们不援助任何逃亡武士…
We aid no fleeing soldiers...


897
01:36:26.168 --> 01:36:30.397
还有，不要议论任何战事
...and we say nothing
about the war's outcome.


898
01:36:32.107 --> 01:36:33.366
明白吗？
Understood?


899
01:36:35.377 --> 01:36:41.676
就在那个节骨眼上
吉村老师出现在了我父亲眼前
Yoshimura-sensei picked that time
to appear before my father.


900
01:36:55.724 --> 01:36:56.883
贯一郎！
Kanichiro?!


901
01:36:58.863 --> 01:37:00.522
吉村来了？
Yoshimura's here?!


902
01:37:00.863 --> 01:37:06.532
他就在门外，浑身上下伤痕累累
He's in front of the gate,
badly wounded.


903
01:37:07.472 --> 01:37:08.801
吉村！
Yoshimura!


904
01:37:10.871 --> 01:37:12.930
我们该怎么办？
What should we do?


905
01:37:15.681 --> 01:37:18.910
好吧，带他到后院
All right, bring him
into the back garden.


906
01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:20.779
是,遵命！
Yes, sir!


907
01:37:33.688 --> 01:37:36.287
为什么他要现在来！
Why did he have to come now?!


908
01:37:37.327 --> 01:37:38.556
为什么！
Why?!


909
01:37:54.045 --> 01:37:57.914
你这个混帐不知道羞耻吗？
You bloody fool!
You should be ashamed.


910
01:37:59.014 --> 01:38:00.533
吉村！
Yoshimura!


911
01:38:16.331 --> 01:38:18.590
次郎右卫门先生…
Squire Jiroemon...


912
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:34.508
可以说那次战斗
While our battle has ended...


913
01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:39.337
我们是一败涂地
...in total defeat...


914
01:38:41.118 --> 01:38:44.747
死在这里，
死在奸人手上…
...to die here at the hands
of some villain...


915
01:38:46.917 --> 01:38:50.156
犹如一条狗
...would be a wasted death.


916
01:38:51.896 --> 01:38:59.384
如果还可以，
我愿意在接受惩罚之后
If I may, I would like to be
of service to my own land.


917
01:39:00.805 --> 01:39:03.764
再和兄弟们为保卫祖国而战
I would like to return there.


918
01:39:04.634 --> 01:39:06.533
都什么时候了？
Now?


919
01:39:07.544 --> 01:39:09.803
一名真正的南部的武士…
A true Nanbu samurai...


920
01:39:10.273 --> 01:39:15.212
应该回到新选组
像男人一样死在那里
...would go back to the Shinsengumi
and die there like a man.


921
01:39:21.621 --> 01:39:23.010
那里？我求你了，别...
I beg you!


922
01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:24.840
不是吗？吉村…
Yoshimura...


923
01:39:26.191 --> 01:39:28.590
因为你的不义不忠
...after what you've done...


924
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.859
如今我不可能让你回来！
没的商量！
...I couldn't possibly ask
the clan to take you back!


925
01:39:36.129 --> 01:39:37.388
至少…
At least...


926
01:39:38.929 --> 01:39:42.268
等到我的伤好
...until my wounds heal.


927
01:39:44.438 --> 01:39:46.457
看在…
For the sake...


928
01:39:47.777 --> 01:39:51.206
我们过去的交情面上
拜托了，求你了！
...of all our years of friendship.


929
01:39:51.307 --> 01:39:54.766
各个部族的人听着！
To all the men of all the clans!


930
01:39:55.316 --> 01:39:57.875
搜索所有的逃亡叛军
Report all rebel soldiers...


931
01:39:58.186 --> 01:40:00.705
交给我们的军队处置
...to the Imperial Army!


932
01:40:01.455 --> 01:40:03.174
隐藏他们的话…
Conceal them...


933
01:40:03.615 --> 01:40:06.244
我们会灭了你们的部族
清醒点！
...and your clan will be suppressed!


934
01:40:07.224 --> 01:40:09.353
我再重复一遍…
I say again...


935
01:40:10.554 --> 01:40:13.323
搜索所有的逃亡叛军
Report all rebel soldiers...


936
01:40:13.663 --> 01:40:16.352
交给我们的军队处置
...to the Imperial Army!


937
01:40:17.403 --> 01:40:22.062
隐藏他们，我们会灭了你们的部族
Conceal them
and your clan will be suppressed!


938
01:40:23.732 --> 01:40:25.101
吉村…
Yoshimura...


939
01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:29.000
作为一个武士
...you're a disgrace.


940
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:33.909
我给你一间屋子
We will leave you alone.


941
01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:38.749
你自尽吧
Kill yourself.


942
01:40:53.827 --> 01:40:56.656
各位这没什么好看的
This is not an entertainment!


943
01:40:57.027 --> 01:40:58.326
快走！
Begone!


944
01:41:14.184 --> 01:41:18.643
快结束了...
佐助君
I'm sorry, Sasuke.


945
01:42:06.426 --> 01:42:07.655
贯一郎…
Kanichiro...


946
01:42:09.296 --> 01:42:12.555
你为什么要弄到这步田地
...why did you fight at Toba-Fushimi?


947
01:42:13.725 --> 01:42:18.594
为什么没有和会津的新选组到大阪
Why didn't you join the Shogun
at Osaka Castle?


948
01:42:19.834 --> 01:42:23.663
和大家在一起，你是能活下来的
Together, you might have had a chance.


949
01:42:25.743 --> 01:42:31.002
你现在这种身体，
就是逃，能逃到哪里去呢？
The way you are now,
how could you escape anywhere?


950
01:42:33.682 --> 01:42:35.171
是责任…
It was...


951
01:42:37.651 --> 01:42:41.480
让我战斗的
...out of duty I fought.


952
01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:49.289
我们失败了，这是真的…
We lost, it's true...


953
01:42:50.729 --> 01:42:53.318
但我还没有死
...but I'm not dead yet.


954
01:42:55.368 --> 01:42:57.727
只要我还活着…
While I'm still alive...


955
01:42:59.638 --> 01:43:03.097
我想回到盛冈
...I want to go back to Morioka.


956
01:43:05.307 --> 01:43:07.796
我想去看一看静…
I want to see Shizu...


957
01:43:10.306 --> 01:43:11.935
和我的孩子们
...and my children.


958
01:43:15.345 --> 01:43:19.544
南部是我的家乡
Nanbu is my land.


959
01:43:20.285 --> 01:43:24.684
我不能赌上南部人的性命
来为你而打破天平
I can't put you on the scales
against all of Nanbu.


960
01:43:25.924 --> 01:43:28.123
如果只是我自己，我会为了你死
If it were only me,
I would die for you.


961
01:43:29.493 --> 01:43:34.522
但我不能因为你一个人
使南部和朝廷为敌
But I can't make Nanbu the enemy
of His Majesty just for you.


962
01:43:36.962 --> 01:43:41.261
你的剑已钝得不能再用了
That sword of yours
won't cut any more.


963
01:43:42.601 --> 01:43:44.540
给你我的剑
I'll give you mine.


964
01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:51.439
这是大和守的锋利宝刀
It's made
by Yamato no Kami Yasusada.


965
01:43:59.649 --> 01:44:04.148
像个武士一样自尽吧！
Use it to cut open your stomach
like a samurai should.


966
01:44:39.182 --> 01:44:42.981
请帮帮他！父亲！
父亲！
Please help him! Father!


967
01:45:17.017 --> 01:45:18.176
主人？
Sir?


968
01:45:22.026 --> 01:45:26.015
肚子里没东西
下不了死的决心
A hungry man
can't meet death properly.


969
01:45:26.425 --> 01:45:28.014
我给他做些吃的
I'll give him some food.


970
01:45:29.165 --> 01:45:32.464
很报歉，我没注意到这些
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.


971
01:45:33.464 --> 01:45:34.833
我来吧
I'll do it.


972
01:45:36.304 --> 01:45:41.793
我也是才想到他肚子空空
I didn't think about it until just now.


973
01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:46.842
给他也带些热水吧
Take him some hot water as well.


974
01:45:56.621 --> 01:45:58.310
南部…
Is it snowing...


975
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:03.049
现在也在下雪吗？
...in Nanbu now. too?


976
01:46:04.959 --> 01:46:07.588
大雪纷飞…
Powder snow...


977
01:46:10.998 --> 01:46:13.687
亲爱的…
Oh, dear...


978
01:46:16.038 --> 01:46:18.437
你现在怎样了？
Now what?


979
01:46:40.554 --> 01:46:41.783
拿着
Here.


980
01:47:12.579 --> 01:47:14.308
这大米…
This rice...


981
01:47:18.388 --> 01:47:21.377
是南部的大米
...comes from Nanbu...


982
01:47:26.157 --> 01:47:31.896
南部的饭团…
Nanbu rice...


983
01:47:35.735 --> 01:47:37.424
真香啊…
It's so good...


984
01:47:39.205 --> 01:47:45.334
口水都要流出来了
香啊
So good I drool to think of it.


985
01:47:47.843 --> 01:47:49.002
吃点儿吧
Enjoy it.


986
01:47:51.883 --> 01:47:55.612
慢慢吃点儿吧
Take your time and enjoy it.


987
01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.759
谢谢你
Thank you.


988
01:49:22.659 --> 01:49:24.088
首先…
First...


989
01:49:27.398 --> 01:49:29.327
用这一两
...one ryo.


990
01:49:31.337 --> 01:49:33.666
给静买个腰带
A kimono sash for Shizu.


991
01:49:35.567 --> 01:49:38.906
这一两…
This one ryo...


992
01:49:41.606 --> 01:49:44.735
是给御津的节日玩具
...is for Mitsu's Doll-Festival stand.


993
01:49:45.945 --> 01:49:51.504
这一个是给庆次郎
买婴儿服用的
This one's for Keijiro's baby robe.


994
01:49:56.154 --> 01:49:59.213
还有，你知道吗？
Well, what do you know?


995
01:50:01.693 --> 01:50:08.891
我还想给嘉一郎买把剑…
Here I wanted to buy
Kaichiro a sword...


996
01:50:09.832 --> 01:50:12.531
但我没有钱了
...but I don't have the money.


997
01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:17.130
嘉一郎…
Kaichiro...


998
01:50:20.610 --> 01:50:24.439
你是绝对不会哭的人
...nothing could make you cry,
could it.


999
01:50:26.549 --> 01:50:28.008
我不值得…
I didn't...


1000
01:50:29.319 --> 01:50:32.838
有一个像你这样的儿子
...deserve a son like you.


1001
01:50:43.456 --> 01:50:46.585
嘉一郎，御津…
Kaichiro and Mitsu...


1002
01:50:48.696 --> 01:50:52.565
还有庆次郎，
我还没见过面的孩子…
...and Keijiro, who I've never seen...


1003
01:50:59.544 --> 01:51:01.443
我想…
I want to...


1004
01:51:03.813 --> 01:51:05.602
用这手，抱抱你们
...hold you.


1005
01:51:14.482 --> 01:51:17.981
静…
Shizu...


1006
01:51:20.491 --> 01:51:26.190
你现在在做什么呢？
...what are you doing right now?


1007
01:51:31.339 --> 01:51:35.768
你能听到我心里的话吗？
Can you hear the words
my heart speaks...


1008
01:51:39.308 --> 01:51:41.967
这些话我从来没办法对你说
...that I never could say?


1009
01:51:46.477 --> 01:51:47.946
听一听好吗？
I fell...


1010
01:51:50.446 --> 01:51:53.215
我深深地…爱着你
...completely in love with you.


1011
01:51:57.685 --> 01:51:59.084
我尽了全力…
I tried...


1012
01:52:00.325 --> 01:52:04.694
去努力
...as hard as I could.


1013
01:52:07.333 --> 01:52:11.892
我做了所能做的一切
I did all I could.


1014
01:52:16.202 --> 01:52:17.641
你…
You...


1015
01:52:20.671 --> 01:52:23.640
不怨我，是吗？
...don't mind, do you?


1016
01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:28.379
静？
Shizu?


1017
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:34.509
我自杀…
It's all right if I...


1018
01:52:37.289 --> 01:52:38.918
不要紧吧？
...kill myself?


1019
01:52:44.998 --> 01:52:47.157
原谅我
Forgive me.


1020
01:52:50.367 --> 01:52:53.336
“让我们到桃树下去
'Let's go to the peach tree.


1021
01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:57.375
如果那里有很多桃子，我们摘吧
'If there are any peaches,
we'll pick them.


1022
01:52:57.506 --> 01:53:00.705
五个给叔叔…”
'Five for Uncle... '


1023
01:53:04.745 --> 01:53:13.383
我能听见御津在歌唱…
声音多么甜美…
I can hear Mitsu singing...
such a sweet little voice...


1024
01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:30.590
御津…
Mitsu...


1025
01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:39.829
我没有一日不…
...you were never out of my mind...


1026
01:53:40.439 --> 01:53:42.998
想着你
...even for a single day.


1027
01:53:45.078 --> 01:53:47.637
你
It's as if...


1028
01:53:49.488 --> 01:53:51.447
是我的唯一
...you're the only one...


1029
01:53:52.657 --> 01:53:57.056
我和你片刻不离
...I wasn't apart
from for even a minute.


1030
01:54:01.996 --> 01:54:03.795
所以御津…
So Mitsu...


1031
01:54:06.265 --> 01:54:09.024
尽管我杀了自己…
...even though I kill myself...


1032
01:54:11.834 --> 01:54:16.963
我也永远在你们身旁
...I'll always be by your side.


1033
01:54:29.881 --> 01:54:31.940
现在我要死了
Now I'm going to die.


1034
01:54:38.230 --> 01:54:39.689
静…
Shizu...


1035
01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:43.089
嘉一郎…
Kaichiro...


1036
01:54:45.029 --> 01:54:46.358
御津…
Mitsu...


1037
01:54:48.969 --> 01:54:50.458
庆次郎…
Keijiro...


1038
01:54:54.038 --> 01:55:02.776
我不会下地狱，我也不会去天堂
I'm not going to hell, or to heaven.


1039
01:55:05.316 --> 01:55:06.675
我…
I'm...


1040
01:55:10.755 --> 01:55:13.244
将和你们在一起…
...going to be with you...


1041
01:55:16.824 --> 01:55:19.223
片刻不离
...every second...


1042
01:55:23.093 --> 01:55:24.652
永远和你们在一起！
...with you!


1043
01:55:40.281 --> 01:55:45.910
吉村老师死的时候我也在场
I was there when
Yoshimura-sensei died.


1044
01:56:04.467 --> 01:56:05.726
大人...
Sir...


1045
01:56:11.836 --> 01:56:13.895
“把这两件东西…”
''Take these two things...''


1046
01:56:14.005 --> 01:56:16.374
“给我家人”
''...to my home.'"


1047
01:56:16.875 --> 01:56:18.364
他没有用我的剑！
He didn't use the sword!


1048
01:56:30.853 --> 01:56:33.122
也没有动饭团…
You didn't touch the rice...


1049
01:56:35.192 --> 01:56:37.021
这个顽固的家伙！
...you stubborn mule!


1050
01:56:40.631 --> 01:56:42.120
贯一郎！
Kanichiro!


1051
01:56:44.731 --> 01:56:46.160
贯一郎！
Kanichiro!


1052
01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:52.169
吃吧！
Eat!


1053
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:54.468
吃呀！
Eat!


1054
01:56:56.179 --> 01:56:57.968
这是南部的米
It's Nanbu rice.


1055
01:56:59.608 --> 01:57:04.677
盛冈的米，用北上河水种的米呀
From Morioka,
grown with Kitakami River water.


1056
01:57:06.417 --> 01:57:07.576
吃呀！
Eat!


1057
01:57:13.156 --> 01:57:14.645
贯一郎…
Kanichiro...


1058
01:57:16.856 --> 01:57:18.555
因为你
...because of you...


1059
01:57:19.865 --> 01:57:24.094
静和孩子们都吃的饱饱的
...Shizu and the children eat their fill.


1060
01:57:26.564 --> 01:57:29.053
现在轮到你了
It's your turn now.


1061
01:57:30.874 --> 01:57:35.133
你做梦都想吃的南部米
You dreamed of Nanbu rice.


1062
01:57:38.342 --> 01:57:40.281
吃呀，贯一郎！
Eat, Kanichiro!


1063
01:57:41.482 --> 01:57:43.571
很香的！
It's good!


1064
01:57:47.381 --> 01:57:48.940
贯一
Kanichiro!


1065
01:57:51.590 --> 01:57:53.389
贯一
Kanichiro!


1066
01:58:04.728 --> 01:58:08.997
他被追任为德川的上级卫士
He was named one of
Lord Tokugawa's advance guard...


1067
01:58:10.967 --> 01:58:13.666
他干的非常不错
...and served well.


1068
01:58:15.847 --> 01:58:20.976
要求自杀…
Rather than suffer dishonor...


1069
01:58:22.046 --> 01:58:26.455
而不是遭受凌辱
...he asked to commit hara-kiri.


1070
01:58:27.655 --> 01:58:32.454
是他自己要求自尽的吗？
That was his choice?


1071
01:58:35.394 --> 01:58:37.023
是的
Yes.


1072
01:58:39.163 --> 01:58:41.352
他拒绝了一会儿…
He refused a second...


1073
01:58:42.963 --> 01:58:46.132
然后勇敢地，一个人…
...and bravely, alone...


1074
01:58:46.402 --> 01:58:48.531
割开了自己的肚子
...cut open his stomach.


1075
01:58:51.371 --> 01:58:54.000
用那把剑吗？
With that sword?


1076
01:58:54.871 --> 01:58:56.100
不
No.


1077
01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:00.369
他想把它留给你
He wanted to give it to you.


1078
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:03.479
他不想这把剑染了他的血
He didn't want it stained.


1079
01:59:05.049 --> 01:59:06.708
他用了另一把
He used another.


1080
01:59:09.358 --> 01:59:11.147
我明白了…
I see...


1081
01:59:19.497 --> 01:59:21.226
主人…
Husband...


1082
01:59:23.766 --> 01:59:26.195
谢谢你
...thank you.


1083
01:59:29.435 --> 01:59:35.204
你如此辛苦的工作…
You worked so hard...


1084
01:59:37.914 --> 01:59:39.643
来养活我们
...to support us.


1085
01:59:44.283 --> 01:59:46.582
您辛苦了...
Thank you.


1086
02:00:29.356 --> 02:00:31.685
那全部就是这样啦...
So that's what happened...


1087
02:00:38.095 --> 02:00:45.263
安排他自杀，一定伤透了你爸爸的心
Ordering him to do that must have
broken your father's heart.


1088
02:00:48.003 --> 02:00:50.972
从那以后…
Suddenly, after that...


1089
02:00:52.543 --> 02:00:57.412
我爸爸像突然变了一个人
...my father was like a different man.


1090
02:00:57.512 --> 02:01:00.241
决不做萨长的军队！
They must never
become the Imperial army!


1091
02:01:00.811 --> 02:01:05.010
是萨长发动了这场战争
The southwestern clans
started this war.


1092
02:01:05.151 --> 02:01:06.710
他们才是叛军！
They are the rebels!


1093
02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:10.449
父亲一向谨慎从事…
He had always been so cautious...


1094
02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.789
但是当秋田投奔萨长的时候
...but when Akita went over
to the southwestern clans...


1095
02:01:13.889 --> 02:01:17.518
他自己带头奋起攻击了他们
...he led the attack on it.


1096
02:01:18.669 --> 02:01:21.688
南部的武士应该
担负起自己的责任！
I call on the samurai of Nanbu
to do their duty!


1097
02:01:21.798 --> 02:01:24.857
我没有想到…
I can only think...


1098
02:01:25.168 --> 02:01:30.727
父亲会想在战斗中寻死
...that he was looking for death
in battle himself.


1099
02:01:31.477 --> 02:01:35.706
不幸的是，他找到了
And, sadly, he found it.


1100
02:01:49.454 --> 02:01:52.513
愿你们一切都好
May all be well with you.


1101
02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:12.229
千秋大人！
Squire Chiaki!


1102
02:02:19.579 --> 02:02:20.808
嘉一郎…
Kaichiro...


1103
02:02:29.928 --> 02:02:32.897
我要去函馆战斗
I'm going to Hakodate to fight.


1104
02:02:34.897 --> 02:02:36.386
是要塞那里吗？
At the fort there?


1105
02:02:36.627 --> 02:02:37.616
是
Yes.


1106
02:02:38.596 --> 02:02:42.585
你不可能活着从那里出来！
You'll never come back
alive out of there!


1107
02:02:47.835 --> 02:02:49.534
回不来我也不在乎
I don't care.


1108
02:02:50.574 --> 02:02:56.103
那不明智，
你知道回不来还要去吗？
That's not very smart. Why go
if you know you won't come back?


1109
02:02:56.943 --> 02:03:01.402
南部武士的职责
就是战斗到最后一刻
The duty of a Nanbu samurai
is to fight until the very last.


1110
02:03:10.021 --> 02:03:12.750
不要去嘛！不要去嘛！
Don't go! Don't go!


1111
02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:18.359
御津…
Mitsu...


1112
02:03:19.570 --> 02:03:21.529
你阻止不了他
...you can't stop him.


1113
02:03:44.686 --> 02:03:47.985
千秋大人，已经够远了
This is far enough, Squire Chiaki.


1114
02:03:48.695 --> 02:03:50.284
谢谢你送我
Thank you.


1115
02:03:52.395 --> 02:03:56.654
这是纯凈的泉水
喝一口吧
This is pure spring-water.
Let's drink from it...


1116
02:03:57.734 --> 02:03:59.293
…好运
...for luck.


1117
02:04:08.102 --> 02:04:10.701
从我的手里喝吧
Drink from my hands.


1118
02:04:18.781 --> 02:04:21.810
现在你从我手里喝
Now you drink from mine.


1119
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:29.648
来
Here.


1120
02:04:35.998 --> 02:04:39.027
我不能接受！
I won't take it!


1121
02:04:40.867 --> 02:04:45.426
当别人都挣扎着活命时…
When everyone else
is trying to stay alive...


1122
02:04:46.607 --> 02:04:48.536
你却要去送死！
...you're going to die!


1123
02:04:51.206 --> 02:04:55.405
到今天你才16岁！
还没有好好地活过
You're only 16!
You haven't lived yet!


1124
02:04:58.015 --> 02:05:01.644
你为什么要去死？
Why do you have to die?


1125
02:05:04.724 --> 02:05:06.123
千秋大人…
Squire Chiaki...


1126
02:05:07.793 --> 02:05:13.162
我不能让爸爸一个人去赴黄泉
...I can't leave the father I love
to cross the River of Death alone.


1127
02:05:22.201 --> 02:05:25.140
那，请你喝吧
So please... drink.


1128
02:05:36.779 --> 02:05:38.078
嘉一郎…
Kaichiro...


1129
02:05:39.348 --> 02:05:40.547
你不能死啊！
...don't die!


1130
02:05:43.718 --> 02:05:45.047
嘉一郎！
Kaichiro!


1131
02:05:50.357 --> 02:05:51.556
千秋…
Chiaki...


1132
02:05:54.496 --> 02:05:55.725
千秋…
Chiaki...


1133
02:05:57.196 --> 02:05:58.665
千秋！
Chiaki!


1134
02:06:00.605 --> 02:06:01.864
嘉一郎…
Kaichiro...


1135
02:06:02.905 --> 02:06:04.204
你不能死！
...don't die!


1136
02:06:05.304 --> 02:06:06.633
不能死啊！
Don't die!


1137
02:06:07.774 --> 02:06:11.903
哥哥！不要去啊！
Brother! Don't go away!


1138
02:06:29.861 --> 02:06:33.560
御津…我必须去
Mitsu... I have to.


1139
02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:35.459
哥哥！
Brother!


1140
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:38.329
哥哥！
Brother!


1141
02:06:44.468 --> 02:06:46.367
哥哥！
Brother!


1142
02:06:47.838 --> 02:06:49.937
御津就拜托你了！
Look after her, will you?


1143
02:06:52.147 --> 02:06:55.876
我去为南部的荣誉而战
I will go and fight for Nanbu.


1144
02:07:13.494 --> 02:07:16.333
哥哥！哥哥！
Brother! Brother!


1145
02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:18.892
哥哥！
Brother!


1146
02:07:30.481 --> 02:07:35.140
嘉一郎再也没有
回到盛冈
Kaichiro never came back
to Morioka.


1147
02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:40.519
他在函馆之战中丢掉了
自己年青的生命
He died in the Battle of Hakodate.


1148
02:07:41.550 --> 02:07:43.179
哥哥！
Brother!


1149
02:07:43.289 --> 02:07:44.418
御津！
Mitsu!


1150
02:07:45.159 --> 02:07:48.588
以后我就是你哥哥
I'll be your big brother now.


1151
02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:59.726
后来…
And then, later on...


1152
02:08:00.067 --> 02:08:02.536
我和御津结了婚
...I married Mitsu.


1153
02:08:29.362 --> 02:08:30.481
小心！
There!


1154
02:08:31.992 --> 02:08:33.021
都检查完了！
All finished!


1155
02:08:33.132 --> 02:08:35.531
辛苦了！
Well done!


1156
02:08:36.231 --> 02:08:37.760
抱歉，让您久等了
Sorry to keep you.


1157
02:08:37.901 --> 02:08:39.060
小伙子…
Minoru...


1158
02:08:44.070 --> 02:08:47.839
不是流行性的，只是一般感冒而已
I don't think it's serious.
Just a cold.


1159
02:08:49.509 --> 02:08:54.578
根据他的症状，我开了些药
I've mixed some medicine
for his symptoms.


1160
02:08:55.148 --> 02:08:58.677
让他饭后吃药，多休息
Give it to him after meals,
and see he gets lots of rest.


1161
02:09:00.657 --> 02:09:02.676
吃了药，才能好哦！
Make sure you take this. OK?


1162
02:09:11.266 --> 02:09:15.255
在下不胜感激，吉村先生...
My humble thanks,
Yoshimura-sensei.


1163
02:09:26.573 --> 02:09:27.632
那就这样吧…
Well...


1164
02:09:36.152 --> 02:09:38.171
谢谢您的帮助
Thank you for your help.


1165
02:09:40.851 --> 02:09:42.580
您小心
Take care.


1166
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:48.479
告辞了
Come on.


1167
02:10:03.908 --> 02:10:10.337
盛冈，在南部，是一个美丽的地方
Morioka, in Nanbu.
It's a beautiful place.


1168
02:10:11.376 --> 02:10:14.875
南边是早池峰山…
Away to the south is Mt Hayachine...


1169
02:10:15.246 --> 02:10:19.615
西边是南昌山和东根山
...with Mt Nansho and Mt Azumane
to the west.


1170
02:10:23.655 --> 02:10:29.964
北边是岩手山和姬神山
In the north are
Mt Iwate and Mt Himekami.


1171
02:10:30.963 --> 02:10:35.692
在高山的外面…
Out of the high mountains...


1172
02:10:36.133 --> 02:10:38.362
爷爷，背背我！
Grandpa, carry me!


1173
02:10:38.472 --> 02:10:41.531
不行！武士自己走路！
No! A samurai walks!


1174
02:10:41.842 --> 02:10:43.171
是，爷爷
Yes, sir.


1175
02:10:43.911 --> 02:10:47.930
啊，像画一样美丽的土地
Ah, it's pretty as a picture!


1176
02:10:48.311 --> 02:10:52.180
全日本都没有别的地方
像它一样美！
There's nowhere like it in all Japan!


1177
02:11:36.623 --> 02:11:39.642
祝 一切都好
May all be well with you.


1178
02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:59.369
御津接连失去了，这么多亲人…
Mitsu has lost so many
who are close...


1179
02:12:00.070 --> 02:12:05.339
直到现在，她睡觉的时候
还抓住我的手不放开
...that even now in sleep she holds
my hand and won't let go.


1180
02:12:06.179 --> 02:12:11.578
我不能用语言表达
御津给了我多大的帮助
Words can't express how much
of a help Mitsu has been to me.


1181
02:12:12.518 --> 02:12:15.447
父亲 次郎右卫门战死之后
After my father died in battle...


1182
02:12:15.717 --> 02:12:19.556
我们大野家
被当作战犯而受到迫害
...my family were treated as rebels
and suppressed.


1183
02:12:19.757 --> 02:12:24.356
但也许就是因为这个
我和御津才能在一起
But perhaps that was luck,
as it made it possible for me...


1184
02:12:24.456 --> 02:12:26.485
也算是种缘分吧
...to marry Mitsu.


1185
02:12:27.865 --> 02:12:31.624
佐助，现在已经成了
一家企业的老板…
Sasuke, who has become the boss
of a gambling syndicate...


1186
02:12:31.935 --> 02:12:35.664
但他直到现在，还对我们有所芥蒂
...looks out for us even now.


1187
02:12:36.974 --> 02:12:41.033
我和御津商量
决定搬到满洲去…
Mitsu and I have decided
to move to China...


1188
02:12:41.143 --> 02:12:45.042
我们想在那儿我们继续做医生
... where we will practice medicine
in Manchuria.


1189
02:12:45.883 --> 02:12:50.312
我们要渡过大海
在那里定居，终此一生
We will cross the sea
and live in that empty land...


1190
02:12:50.782 --> 02:12:54.411
作为医生，尽点微薄之力
...and do the best we can there.


1191
02:12:58.151 --> 02:13:05.289
盛冈，在南部，那里风景如画！
Morioka, in Nanbu.
It's pretty as a picture!


1192
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:08.919
全日本都没有
别的地方像它那样美丽！
There's nowhere like it in all Japan!


1193
02:13:10.029 --> 02:13:14.028
盛冈的樱花，破石而出之花
The Morioka cherry blossom
splits through rock to bloom.


1194
02:13:14.698 --> 02:13:19.067
盛冈的木兰，朝北开花
The Morioka magnolia blooms
even facing north.


1195
02:13:20.107 --> 02:13:25.046
所以我想让你们超越时间
So I want you to run ahead
of the times.


1196
02:13:26.146 --> 02:13:30.235
美丽地绽放吧
Go wild. Bloom.
