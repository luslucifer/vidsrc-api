[Gwen]<i>The dream</i>
<i>starts like this.</i>


4
00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:31.620
<i>I see myself getting
out of the water</i>


5
00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:42.998
<i>and I see somebody,
I can't see it very clearly,</i>


6
00:00:43.032 --> 00:00:45.868
<i>but I see a person
from the back.</i>


7
00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:50.939
<i>I follow him.</i>

8
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:00.382
<i>And then I see a lot of people</i>

9
00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.950
<i>standing
in the communal showers.</i>


10
00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:03.952
<i>Nobody is looking at me.</i>

11
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:16.131
<i>There's a little hallway
with four bathroom stalls.</i>


12
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.668
<i>After those four
regular bathroom doors,</i>


13
00:01:19.702 --> 00:01:20.869
<i>there's a big door.</i>

14
00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:31.346
<i>From the moment
I opened the door,</i>


15
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.515
<i>it's like things
moved really quickly.</i>


16
00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:35.951
[water running]

17
00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.360
<i>At that moment,
I see just a lot of blood.</i>


18
00:01:47.197 --> 00:01:49.031
<i>It's everywhere and I panicked.</i>

19
00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:01.910
How can something
that wasn't scary at the time


20
00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:03.078
be so scary later?

21
00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:06.215
Like, how can I wake up
at night now being terrified,


22
00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.749
even though back then
it was like,


23
00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:10.185
"All right, let's go into the
shower. Let's just do this."


24
00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:28.203
<i>My mom
always called me "Waterrat."</i>


25
00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.506
Literally, It'd be a water rat.

26
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:33.208
That's somebody
who just always wants


27
00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:34.109
to be in the water.

28
00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:38.513
I always loved swimming,
I was always in the water.


29
00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:47.322
<i>I grew up in a small town
in Southern Holland,</i>


30
00:02:47.357 --> 00:02:49.858
<i>in what I would call
a very normal family.</i>


31
00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:52.327
<i>I had loving parents,
I had an older brother.</i>


32
00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:56.732
<i>One of my favorite memories
growing up</i>


33
00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:58.867
<i>was getting together for Easter</i>

34
00:02:58.901 --> 00:03:00.135
<i>and it'd be the whole family</i>

35
00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.903
<i>and we would do
this Eastern egg hunt</i>


36
00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:04.039
<i>and I would always try
to beat my cousins,</i>


37
00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:07.075
<i>usually not successfully
cause I was the smallest.</i>


38
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.610
<i>I was the youngest one
in the family.</i>


39
00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:16.084
<i>My childhood was loving,
it was happy.</i>


40
00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.152
<i>It was comfortable.</i>

41
00:03:29.432 --> 00:03:30.265
Yeah.

42
00:04:25.488 --> 00:04:27.155
<i>The first memory I have,</i>

43
00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:29.191
<i>we were biking to a swim camp.</i>

44
00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:33.528
<i>I would bike
and he would bike next to me,</i>


45
00:04:33.563 --> 00:04:35.464
<i>and it was very clear
that his focus</i>


46
00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:36.998
<i>was entirely on me.</i>

47
00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:39.868
<i>And that felt really nice.</i>

48
00:04:39.902 --> 00:04:41.370
[alarm goes off]

49
00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:49.177
<i>He was an adult
that was swimming on my team,</i>


50
00:04:49.212 --> 00:04:51.980
<i>but would also coach us
when the head couch was out.</i>


51
00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.818
<i>"And I just thought, " Wow,
why is this big swimmer,</i>


52
00:04:56.853 --> 00:04:59.721
<i>this cool guy, that everybody
has respect for...</i>


53
00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:01.490
<i>why does he put so much emphasis</i>

54
00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:02.657
<i>on getting to know me?</i>

55
00:05:02.692 --> 00:05:04.793
<i>"And why is he asking me
all these questions?"</i>


56
00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:08.163
<i>I just felt
like he really cared,</i>


57
00:05:08.197 --> 00:05:09.765
<i>and he became my best friend.</i>

58
00:05:26.816 --> 00:05:28.717
<i>There were moments
where I was afraid of him,</i>


59
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:30.218
but most of the time I wasn't

60
00:05:30.253 --> 00:05:32.921
and that just feels off.
That feels weird.


61
00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:35.190
It feels like if somebody
hurts you,


62
00:05:35.224 --> 00:05:36.925
you should be afraid of them

63
00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:39.528
and you should be angry
at them afterward.


64
00:05:39.562 --> 00:05:42.898
So, when you don't feel anger
and you don't feel...


65
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.235
like you were afraid of them

66
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.038
then it must not be
something that was wrong.


67
00:05:50.072 --> 00:05:52.574
It's not logical.

68
00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:19.034
[starts crying]

69
00:06:33.483 --> 00:06:35.317
<i>My boyfriend, actually, he said,</i>

70
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:37.252
"I think you need
to not run away from it


71
00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:39.354
and really try to face it."

72
00:06:41.624 --> 00:06:45.794
Actually, what a lot of people
don't realize is how much traumatic is


73
00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:48.997
with something
that happens so long ago.


74
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:50.565
<i>Well, even 18 years later,</i>

75
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.902
almost every week that
something happens that, like,


76
00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:58.206
triggers some, like,
tears or even panics.


77
00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:06.615
[Gwen]<i>I know I need help.</i>
<i>So I started calling experts.</i>


78
00:07:07.717 --> 00:07:09.651
[phone rings]

79
00:07:09.685 --> 00:07:13.221
Thank you for making the time
to chat. Hey, how are you?


80
00:07:13.256 --> 00:07:15.490
He was both an older teammate

81
00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:18.159
and then he would swap in
for the coach.


82
00:07:18.194 --> 00:07:21.796
So he would get me
gifts and cards and letters,


83
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:25.166
and he would say,
"Gosh, you... I know you're 11,


84
00:07:25.201 --> 00:07:29.337
but you're actually 18
in the way that you behave."


85
00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:32.941
<i>And after hearing my story,
they all said the same thing.</i>


86
00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:34.876
It's classic grooming.

87
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:37.078
I started thinking,
"What's this grooming thing?"


88
00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:39.614
I feel like it's something that
I really need to understand.


89
00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:52.527
[Oprah]<i>Most kids are molested
by people that they trust.</i>


90
00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:55.463
Either a family member
or a close friend.


91
00:07:55.498 --> 00:07:57.632
That is how it happens,

92
00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:00.602
and the grooming
is what makes it possible.


93
00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:01.536
I liked him

94
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:02.971
and I would tell him
I liked him,


95
00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:04.172
and I liked the attention.

96
00:08:04.206 --> 00:08:07.943
He makes the child feel
that the child is a part of it.


97
00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:09.744
[Gwen]<i>I thought</i>
<i>that because I liked him</i>


98
00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:11.346
<i>it wasn't really abuse.</i>

99
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:13.381
<i>But maybe it was.</i>

100
00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:16.952
Confusion is actually
the biggest thing


101
00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:19.688
that keeps people powerless.

102
00:08:25.828 --> 00:08:28.063
After learning about grooming,

103
00:08:28.097 --> 00:08:32.400
I was, first of all,
really angry.


104
00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:35.036
[Gwen]<i>Why had I never heard</i>
<i>from this before?</i>


105
00:08:35.071 --> 00:08:36.972
<i>Why don't we all know
about this?</i>


106
00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:41.443
So I decided that I wanted
to make a film.


107
00:08:43.245 --> 00:08:45.880
This is what I need to do,
and this is a story


108
00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:48.249
that I can tell
because I went through it.


109
00:09:19.382 --> 00:09:21.216
[man] Okay, let me know
when you're good.


110
00:09:21.584 --> 00:09:22.517
Hey, Barbi.

111
00:09:24.387 --> 00:09:25.553
[man] And it's all yours.

112
00:09:25.588 --> 00:09:28.356
What happened when you learned
what grooming was?


113
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:30.125
[Barbi]
When I learned about grooming,


114
00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:33.128
I started really reflecting back

115
00:09:33.162 --> 00:09:34.496
and remembering,

116
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.332
"wow, like, all these incidents

117
00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:40.468
that I thought
were joyful and fun, he...


118
00:09:40.503 --> 00:09:42.537
he was grooming me.

119
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:45.874
He was setting me up
for this abuse.


120
00:09:48.644 --> 00:09:50.045
I think he targeted me

121
00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:54.783
because he could spot
my desire to please.


122
00:09:54.817 --> 00:09:57.619
It was hard for me
to express myself


123
00:09:57.653 --> 00:10:00.321
and I never really felt
like I fit in.


124
00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:02.023
I was really quiet.

125
00:10:02.058 --> 00:10:04.759
I really kept to myself.

126
00:10:04.794 --> 00:10:07.595
I think I was always quiet
and sort of reserved,


127
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.466
and always had, like, a book
that I would be reading.


128
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.101
My parents fought constantly

129
00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:15.170
about finances
and lack of money.


130
00:10:15.204 --> 00:10:19.240
That constant emotional
upheaval within the house


131
00:10:20.076 --> 00:10:23.211
made me feel very vulnerable.

132
00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:26.481
What I started to realize
is that what happened to me


133
00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:28.883
wasn't the exemption,
it was the rule.


134
00:10:41.564 --> 00:10:44.699
[Andy]<i>I would suggest you</i>
<i>consider proxy clarification</i>


135
00:10:44.734 --> 00:10:47.469
<i>and what happens
is you take the victim,</i>


136
00:10:47.503 --> 00:10:51.673
have an offender match them
who's really in recovery


137
00:10:51.707 --> 00:10:54.409
and have them
just have a conversation.


138
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.885
<i>There's a woman who called
me one day after I did a workshop</i>


139
00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:05.220
and she said,

140
00:11:05.254 --> 00:11:08.056
"Could you hook me up with
one of these proxy clarifications?"


141
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.023
We did it,

142
00:11:09.058 --> 00:11:12.026
and 'til she died,
I got a card every year


143
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:13.862
and the essence
of what she said was,


144
00:11:13.896 --> 00:11:15.663
"I felt responsibility,

145
00:11:15.698 --> 00:11:17.699
like, almost
a physical sensation of it


146
00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:19.067
lifting from me,

147
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:21.035
and I finally felt
free at last."


148
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:03.511
[man] Up and here you go.

149
00:12:04.713 --> 00:12:06.247
Okay.

150
00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:08.850
This is file 1.
Mark, cameras A and B.


151
00:12:10.553 --> 00:12:13.054
Okay, give me
about 30 seconds in here.


152
00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:18.426
[Gwen] Okay, it's good? Awesome.

153
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.395
What are the steps
that you go through


154
00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:23.331
when you would groom a child?

155
00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:25.767
[Dennis] Well, I was
very confident in my grooming.


156
00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:27.068
I was very confident

157
00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:28.937
that I could make a kid like me.

158
00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:42.450
<i>First of all, you have
to pick the right child.</i>


159
00:12:43.652 --> 00:12:46.120
You know, the one you
feel most comfortable with.


160
00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:48.756
The one that you heard things
about him in the family,


161
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.391
that's may be having
a hard time.


162
00:12:50.426 --> 00:12:53.161
"Who do I think I could train?"

163
00:12:53.195 --> 00:12:54.462
I was very trusting.

164
00:12:54.496 --> 00:12:56.130
- Insolated.
- Alone.


165
00:12:56.165 --> 00:12:57.098
Quiet.

166
00:12:57.132 --> 00:12:58.199
On my own a little bit.

167
00:13:01.437 --> 00:13:04.239
[Gwen]<i>I was</i>
<i>an insecure little girl.</i>


168
00:13:04.273 --> 00:13:06.808
<i>My body language probably
showed up a little bit.</i>


169
00:13:06.842 --> 00:13:09.878
I was really struggling
with who I was,


170
00:13:09.912 --> 00:13:12.814
why were my friends
not accepting me.


171
00:13:12.848 --> 00:13:15.483
I was really looking
for somebody


172
00:13:15.517 --> 00:13:16.618
that cared for me.

173
00:13:19.889 --> 00:13:21.990
[Jim]<i>Can you spot</i>
<i>the sex offender?</i>


174
00:13:22.024 --> 00:13:25.660
Is it Mr. Businessman here
or is it Deathroll tall guy?


175
00:13:25.694 --> 00:13:28.296
The answer is yes, no,
both, maybe, I don't know.


176
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.299
So, how does a sex offender
groom a victim?


177
00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:33.368
Adolescent female victims
tell us,


178
00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:35.737
"He was my best friend."

179
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:38.840
"I'm going to do things
and buy things for you."


180
00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:40.475
"I'm going to send you cards,

181
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:43.745
I'm going to give you
little bracelets


182
00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.647
or I'm going to send you
flowers.


183
00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:47.248
I'm going to give you things."

184
00:13:47.283 --> 00:13:49.217
[Gwen]<i>As you were talking,</i>
<i>I was remembering</i>


185
00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:51.419
<i>the letters and the cards
that he would give me,</i>


186
00:13:51.453 --> 00:13:53.955
and it almost felt like
you were telling my story.


187
00:13:54.023 --> 00:13:57.158
Guess I always viewed him
as somebody who just made


188
00:13:57.192 --> 00:13:58.159
a little misstep

189
00:13:58.193 --> 00:14:00.862
and he just happened
to fall in love with me


190
00:14:00.896 --> 00:14:02.263
at the wrong time.

191
00:14:02.298 --> 00:14:05.566
[Jim] If the offender
has done their job grooming,


192
00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:08.069
it's going to feel like,
"I was special to him."


193
00:14:08.103 --> 00:14:10.905
You know, you are one of many
who are special to him.


194
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.607
- That's the issue.
- Do you think that?


195
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:15.043
From what I know about your
case, I can almost assure you


196
00:14:15.077 --> 00:14:16.811
there were other victims
out there.


197
00:14:16.845 --> 00:14:18.913
Absolutely other victims.

198
00:14:18.948 --> 00:14:21.015
His grooming process
was very smooth.


199
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.750
Very smooth.

200
00:14:23.485 --> 00:14:25.486
You mentioned you have letters,

201
00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:29.090
I think that if we look
at those letters,


202
00:14:29.124 --> 00:14:30.925
that we're going to see
that that process


203
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.627
is very well done.

204
00:14:32.661 --> 00:14:35.964
You don't get to be
that good at it by accident.


205
00:14:35.998 --> 00:14:38.566
[Jim] You get to be that good
at it through practice.


206
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.769
I've always firmly believe
it was just me.


207
00:14:41.804 --> 00:14:43.972
That he would never do this
to someone else,


208
00:14:44.006 --> 00:14:45.606
and I've never really thought

209
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:47.809
about there being other victims.

210
00:14:47.843 --> 00:14:49.577
[Gwen] And it changes the story.

211
00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:53.014
So, I'm considering
potentially going to Holland


212
00:14:54.116 --> 00:14:57.452
to talk to my family
and maybe talk to the police.


213
00:14:57.486 --> 00:14:58.720
Your family knows nothing?

214
00:14:58.754 --> 00:15:00.922
[Gwen] When I was starting
to get all these dreams,


215
00:15:00.956 --> 00:15:03.024
and I remembered
what had happened,


216
00:15:03.058 --> 00:15:04.192
I actually told them.

217
00:15:04.226 --> 00:15:05.593
[Jim] And how long ago was that?

218
00:15:05.627 --> 00:15:06.995
That's when I was about 17.

219
00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:08.429
- [Jim] Okay.
- So, long time ago.


220
00:15:08.464 --> 00:15:10.698
- [Jim] So, where did that happened?
- The "where."


221
00:15:10.733 --> 00:15:12.300
So we had one conversation
at night,


222
00:15:12.334 --> 00:15:14.502
and I remember my dad
running out on the street


223
00:15:14.536 --> 00:15:17.271
with a baseball bat and he was
like, "I'm going to kill him."


224
00:15:17.306 --> 00:15:19.807
And, like, so, so, so angry.

225
00:15:19.842 --> 00:15:21.709
And then we never
talked about it again.


226
00:15:21.744 --> 00:15:24.278
The location
while thinking about this


227
00:15:24.313 --> 00:15:26.914
is going to be
a heck of a trigger.


228
00:15:28.817 --> 00:15:32.153
Expect to be affected a lot.

229
00:15:44.033 --> 00:15:46.367
[Gwen]<i>I'm going to Holland,</i>
<i>actually, in two days.</i>


230
00:15:46.402 --> 00:15:48.436
It makes me very nervous,
cause on the one hand,


231
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.305
I feel a lot of conviction
and I feel a lot of power


232
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.508
and, like, I need to go
do this and I need to,


233
00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:56.611
you know, make sure that
there's no other people and...


234
00:15:56.645 --> 00:15:58.479
But then there's
other days when I think,


235
00:15:58.547 --> 00:16:00.882
"But I don't want
to mess up his life.


236
00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:02.016
<i>What if he's married?"</i>

237
00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:04.952
I've got no idea where he is.
I don't know anything


238
00:16:04.987 --> 00:16:06.487
about what has happened to him.

239
00:16:13.028 --> 00:16:15.997
I have not said his name
in 20 years.


240
00:16:16.031 --> 00:16:19.600
I've never been able
to look him up,


241
00:16:19.635 --> 00:16:20.768
I've never... I don't know.

242
00:16:20.803 --> 00:16:23.871
It's like a physical block.

243
00:16:23.906 --> 00:16:27.141
<i>But I need to cause I do want
to know before I go.</i>


244
00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:29.444
<i>I want to have
a little bit of information.</i>


245
00:16:29.478 --> 00:16:33.114
I'm really afraid
to see a picture.


246
00:16:33.148 --> 00:16:36.084
I don't... I really don't want
to see his face.


247
00:16:39.922 --> 00:16:41.556
I really don't know
if I want to.


248
00:16:46.428 --> 00:16:47.595
[sighs]

249
00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:52.300
I can't even...
I don't want to see it.


250
00:16:52.768 --> 00:16:53.801
[sighs]

251
00:16:58.707 --> 00:16:59.574
[sighs]

252
00:17:10.953 --> 00:17:11.786
He showed up.

253
00:17:27.803 --> 00:17:31.139
[starts crying harder]

254
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.644
It makes you want to throw up.

255
00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:42.316
I don't know. I guess I
started questioning it again


256
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:45.520
and start thinking,
"was it just me? Was it..."


257
00:17:47.723 --> 00:17:49.290
"Did you not do anything wrong?"

258
00:17:52.995 --> 00:17:55.329
Yeah, I just want to make sure
it doesn't happen again


259
00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:57.331
to other people.

260
00:17:59.768 --> 00:18:01.402
[Harriet] <i>You have to organize</i>

261
00:18:02.604 --> 00:18:06.174
and accept the disorganization
about what you feel.


262
00:18:06.942 --> 00:18:08.709
<i>In that case, it's a step.</i>

263
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:10.178
<i>It's progress.</i>

264
00:18:15.884 --> 00:18:19.353
[Gwen]<i>After 20 years,</i>
<i>the memories of my childhood</i>


265
00:18:19.388 --> 00:18:21.689
<i>are just messy and blurry
and incomplete.</i>


266
00:18:24.593 --> 00:18:26.727
<i>I want to have a better
picture of what happened.</i>


267
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.032
<i>Mostly I'm going to go to
Holland to speak with my family</i>


268
00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:33.401
<i>after so many years of silence.</i>

269
00:18:33.435 --> 00:18:34.635
This is the one thing

270
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.505
that feels like it's
still standing in between us.


271
00:18:41.944 --> 00:18:44.345
I am going to look
for the letters.


272
00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:47.281
They should all be
in this little cabinet.


273
00:18:49.284 --> 00:18:51.252
<i>But is possible
my parents found them</i>


274
00:18:51.286 --> 00:18:52.920
<i>at some point
and threw them out.</i>


275
00:19:01.096 --> 00:19:04.799
<i>I want to report publicly
if I can do it.</i>


276
00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:06.968
It's still something
that I'm not sure of.


277
00:19:07.002 --> 00:19:09.937
I think it depends
on the conversations


278
00:19:09.972 --> 00:19:10.871
I'm going to have.

279
00:19:10.906 --> 00:19:12.440
It's going to depend
on the letters,


280
00:19:12.474 --> 00:19:14.442
it's going to depend
on how I feel in the moment.


281
00:23:46.882 --> 00:23:49.283
[Asia]<i>He also</i>
<i>groomed my family.</i>


282
00:23:49.317 --> 00:23:52.286
Like, for example, he asked
my dad for piano lessons.


283
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.589
He had a sister
into our dance club.


284
00:23:55.624 --> 00:23:57.658
And I asked my mom
recently, I was like,


285
00:23:57.692 --> 00:23:59.894
"Why did you
let me go with him?"


286
00:23:59.928 --> 00:24:00.995
Like, "He was a man."

287
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:03.364
Like, "Didn't you think
it was weird that some man


288
00:24:03.398 --> 00:24:05.533
wanted to spend time
with your 5-year-old?"


289
00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:07.868
<i>And she was like,
"No, you wanted to go,</i>"


290
00:24:07.903 --> 00:24:09.003
<i>and you were so happy.</i>

291
00:24:09.037 --> 00:24:11.705
<i>"You know, I didn't think
anything was going on."</i>


292
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.475
Like, he didn't set off
that vibe.


293
00:24:14.509 --> 00:24:17.411
He didn't set off
on a pedophile vibe.


294
00:24:17.445 --> 00:24:20.881
Always having priests
come to our home


295
00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:24.051
was like Jesus Christ himself
was in our house.


296
00:24:24.085 --> 00:24:28.489
[Keith] <i>He infiltrated our
family structure in such a way.</i>


297
00:24:28.523 --> 00:24:30.991
I mean, my parents
went to confession to him.


298
00:24:31.026 --> 00:24:32.893
He knew
what all their sins were.


299
00:25:02.791 --> 00:25:04.692
[Gwen] This is May, '97.

300
00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:07.561
So that's right about
when he first saw me.


301
00:25:17.005 --> 00:25:19.139
This was my group,
I mean, my class,


302
00:25:19.174 --> 00:25:20.608
they were kind of bullying me,

303
00:25:20.642 --> 00:25:22.810
and I was really unhappy
in this period.


304
00:25:22.844 --> 00:25:27.147
They always called me,
like, "Sheep. Dork."


305
00:25:27.182 --> 00:25:30.284
But the last day of school,
we had like a little party


306
00:25:30.318 --> 00:25:33.787
and there was a song popular
at the time


307
00:25:33.822 --> 00:25:36.357
that was called, "Girl,
you are as ugly as the night,"


308
00:25:36.391 --> 00:25:38.025
and they started
playing that song


309
00:25:38.059 --> 00:25:39.426
and then they all...

310
00:25:39.461 --> 00:25:41.562
They've thought about it,
clearly.


311
00:25:41.596 --> 00:25:43.564
Cause they all,
like, went to the back


312
00:25:43.598 --> 00:25:44.798
and kind of, like, moved,

313
00:25:44.833 --> 00:25:46.934
so I would be the only one
in the middle of the room


314
00:25:46.968 --> 00:25:49.236
and then everybody would be
in a circle around me


315
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.405
and started pointing
and singing the song.


316
00:25:51.439 --> 00:25:54.875
And it was so mean,
it's like so...


317
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:56.744
I don't know.
I'll never forget that moment.


318
00:26:20.635 --> 00:26:21.468
Yeah.

319
00:26:24.873 --> 00:26:25.706
Yeah.

320
00:28:44.546 --> 00:28:46.113
So I'm going to go upstairs

321
00:28:46.147 --> 00:28:49.249
and see if the letters
that he kind of wrote me


322
00:28:49.284 --> 00:28:50.884
like 20 years ago are upstairs.

323
00:28:51.719 --> 00:28:53.153
And I don't know
if they're there,


324
00:28:53.188 --> 00:28:54.922
and I don't know
what's going to be in them


325
00:28:54.956 --> 00:28:55.956
if they're there and...

326
00:28:57.525 --> 00:29:01.195
I'm actually nervous to see
if there's stuff in there


327
00:29:01.229 --> 00:29:02.362
that I don't remember

328
00:29:02.397 --> 00:29:04.398
and I think there's
pictures there too.


329
00:29:10.238 --> 00:29:12.439
So they're in that
bottom drawer, I think.


330
00:29:20.582 --> 00:29:22.216
This one's empty.
That's bad news.


331
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.284
I'm afraid that they
threw them out.


332
00:29:28.656 --> 00:29:30.190
Oh, my God, it's all empty.

333
00:29:45.773 --> 00:29:47.541
They cleaned it out,
it's all gone.


334
00:29:59.854 --> 00:30:00.687
[sighs]

335
00:30:28.049 --> 00:30:29.349
Can I take a moment?

336
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.495
[starts crying]

337
00:30:55.843 --> 00:30:57.511
I don't know if I want
to read them now.


338
00:31:15.897 --> 00:31:17.798
I'm worried
that it's going to confuse me.


339
00:31:17.832 --> 00:31:19.232
It's going to confuse me.

340
00:31:23.571 --> 00:31:26.239
I'm worried that it's going
to say all these nice things


341
00:31:26.274 --> 00:31:27.107
and then...

342
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.414
and I'm going
to question it again.


343
00:31:42.056 --> 00:31:43.557
[exhales]

344
00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:53.300
This one's really short. But...

345
00:31:58.239 --> 00:31:59.873
[man voice] <i>"Dear Gwen,</i>

346
00:31:59.907 --> 00:32:02.442
<i>I've known you
for two and a half years now.</i>


347
00:32:02.477 --> 00:32:03.944
<i>You know that most of the time</i>

348
00:32:03.978 --> 00:32:06.013
<i>I've had very special
feelings for you.</i>


349
00:32:07.048 --> 00:32:09.349
<i>That I would do
anything for you.</i>


350
00:32:09.384 --> 00:32:11.284
<i>That you can come to me
with anything,</i>


351
00:32:11.319 --> 00:32:13.820
<i>no matter how big
or small the problem,</i>


352
00:32:13.855 --> 00:32:15.822
<i>I want to solve
everything for you.</i>


353
00:32:16.958 --> 00:32:19.493
<i>Gwenny,
look at your beautiful eyes,</i>


354
00:32:19.527 --> 00:32:21.661
<i>your sweet, beautiful,
innocent face.</i>


355
00:32:22.997 --> 00:32:25.265
<i>Put your soft arms around me.</i>

356
00:32:25.299 --> 00:32:26.967
<i>Surrender
to what you're feeling.</i>


357
00:32:27.835 --> 00:32:29.436
<i>It wasn't just that little ass</i>

358
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.638
<i>that caused my little spark.</i>

359
00:32:31.672 --> 00:32:35.475
<i>Also that playful wrestling
made my desire grow.</i>


360
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.545
<i>"The thought of you
makes my whole body tremble."</i>


361
00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:40.847
It's so gross. 
It's so gross!

362
00:32:42.683 --> 00:32:44.951
[man voice]<i>"I just want</i>
<i>to wake up next to you</i>"


363
00:32:44.986 --> 00:32:46.553
<i>in a single bed
on Sunday morning.</i>


364
00:32:47.155 --> 00:32:48.622
<i>I just want to take off</i>

365
00:32:48.656 --> 00:32:50.791
<i>"your blue lingerie
with my teeth."</i>


366
00:32:53.561 --> 00:32:55.762
[Gwen]<i>I remember liking</i>
<i>what was in them,</i>


367
00:32:55.797 --> 00:32:59.299
now I'm disgusted about them.
But I remember thinking,


368
00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:02.035
"It's so great all these
things that he's talking about."


369
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.605
Like, "You're so beautiful,
you're so..."


370
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.375
"When you do this with your
mouth, you're so bla, bla, bla."


371
00:33:08.409 --> 00:33:10.010
"The way you do this,
you look so cute.


372
00:33:10.044 --> 00:33:11.678
You look so innocent.
You look so..."


373
00:33:11.712 --> 00:33:13.713
It's disgusting.

374
00:33:15.116 --> 00:33:17.117
Back then, I would read them,
and I would think,


375
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:19.653
"Oh, somebody likes me."
You know?


376
00:33:24.225 --> 00:33:26.426
First of all, he would send me
postcards like this.


377
00:33:27.695 --> 00:33:30.197
And he's an idiot. He clearly
didn't know what he was doing.


378
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:34.234
You wouldn't write
all these stuff on paper


379
00:33:34.268 --> 00:33:35.335
with dates on them

380
00:33:35.369 --> 00:33:37.037
if you knew what the hell
you were doing.


381
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:39.417
I don't think he knew that he
was doing something wrong.


382
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:41.441
He doesn't. He still doesn't.

383
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.544
And that makes me sad.

384
00:33:44.579 --> 00:33:48.148
It's like, it's just
a sad soul that, like,


385
00:33:49.717 --> 00:33:51.384
fell in love with an 11-year-old

386
00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:53.854
and now I'm going ruin
his life for it.


387
00:33:53.888 --> 00:33:55.922
That doesn't feel right,
you know?


388
00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.780
[Dennis] <i>It starts from
the moment they get there.</i>


389
00:34:22.183 --> 00:34:24.351
When they get to my house,
I'm grooming.


390
00:34:24.385 --> 00:34:26.486
To build a trusted relationship.

391
00:34:26.521 --> 00:34:28.088
I'm showing her more affection,

392
00:34:28.122 --> 00:34:29.022
I'm holding her.

393
00:34:29.056 --> 00:34:31.324
You know, I want her
to be my best friend,


394
00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:32.259
that's what I want.

395
00:34:32.293 --> 00:34:34.060
I always loved my uncle,

396
00:34:34.095 --> 00:34:37.597
'til 20 years later
when I had my best memory.


397
00:34:37.632 --> 00:34:39.966
He was special to me.

398
00:34:40.001 --> 00:34:41.801
[Barbi] They would buy me gifts,

399
00:34:41.836 --> 00:34:43.670
they would take me
to feed the ducks.


400
00:34:43.704 --> 00:34:47.107
My uncle would let me
play on his CB radio,


401
00:34:47.141 --> 00:34:48.441
and he would let me go in there

402
00:34:48.476 --> 00:34:50.777
and I would be this big girl

403
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:51.678
sitting in the seat

404
00:34:51.712 --> 00:34:53.146
with the microphone
in front of me


405
00:34:53.181 --> 00:34:57.784
and he even gave me a CB name,
he called me, "Baby face."


406
00:34:57.818 --> 00:35:03.857
Just imagine how it would be
if the one who's grooming you


407
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:05.825
is of your own family

408
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:10.230
and very much liked
by your father and mother


409
00:35:10.264 --> 00:35:12.699
or it is even
your father and mother.


410
00:35:12.733 --> 00:35:14.701
How complicated is that?

411
00:35:14.735 --> 00:35:16.570
To me, my dad was my hero,

412
00:35:16.604 --> 00:35:18.238
so, like, I wanted
to be like him.


413
00:35:18.272 --> 00:35:19.906
I always thought
that he was smart


414
00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:23.310
and like, that he made
something of himself.


415
00:35:23.344 --> 00:35:26.646
He kind of seemed
like a father figure to me.


416
00:35:26.681 --> 00:35:29.316
[Nicole] <i>He was around 65.</i>

417
00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.251
<i>He would take me privately
into the back</i>


418
00:35:31.285 --> 00:35:32.819
and ask me how I was doing.

419
00:35:32.853 --> 00:35:34.421
You know, what my opinions were,

420
00:35:34.455 --> 00:35:35.889
how I was doing in school.

421
00:35:35.923 --> 00:35:37.857
He would make me special meals.

422
00:35:37.892 --> 00:35:38.992
He was affectionate.

423
00:35:39.026 --> 00:35:40.627
[Dennis]
I would show the affection.


424
00:35:40.661 --> 00:35:42.306
First thing when she got
out of the car,


425
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:43.430
I'd be there to greet her,

426
00:35:44.398 --> 00:35:47.200
hug her and hold her.
I almost never left her.


427
00:35:47.235 --> 00:35:49.202
She was my girlfriend to me,
you know?


428
00:35:49.237 --> 00:35:50.670
Rather than a little kid.

429
00:35:51.672 --> 00:35:53.573
When she came in my room,
I'd be on my computer.


430
00:35:53.608 --> 00:35:56.209
"Come on, sit on my lap.
You can play the computer."


431
00:35:56.244 --> 00:35:57.410
You know?

432
00:35:57.445 --> 00:35:59.546
"I don't let anybody else
play it,


433
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.947
but I'll let you play it."

434
00:36:02.149 --> 00:36:05.452
Well, I definitely
was clearly his favorite.


435
00:36:05.486 --> 00:36:07.420
He bought me some fragrances.

436
00:36:07.455 --> 00:36:09.389
- He gave me a ring.
- Lotions.


437
00:36:09.423 --> 00:36:10.968
- Flowers.
- Money.


438
00:36:10.992 --> 00:36:12.459
- Jewelry.
- Perfumes.


439
00:36:12.493 --> 00:36:13.593
Ice cream.

440
00:36:13.628 --> 00:36:14.527
Plane tickets.

441
00:36:14.562 --> 00:36:16.429
[Dennis] I was a con artist,

442
00:36:16.464 --> 00:36:19.432
and I was constantly putting
thoughts on their head.


443
00:36:19.467 --> 00:36:21.735
You know, I guess you
can call it brainwashing.


444
00:36:21.769 --> 00:36:23.536
I guess it is brainwashing.

445
00:36:23.571 --> 00:36:25.305
That's what it was
all about, you know?


446
00:36:25.339 --> 00:36:28.308
I was getting what I want.
You know, they loved me.


447
00:36:28.342 --> 00:36:30.243
I knew that I had
to make them think


448
00:36:30.278 --> 00:36:32.412
I was the greatest grandpa
in the world.


449
00:36:34.582 --> 00:36:36.216
Did you, like, have code words

450
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.084
with your abuser

451
00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:41.554
that meant something special
to you and him?


452
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:43.923
[Gwen] There was this thing
which I had forgotten about,


453
00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:45.592
but it came back
through the letters


454
00:36:45.626 --> 00:36:50.530
where nine is my lucky number
and he...


455
00:36:50.564 --> 00:36:52.565
kind of made it
his lucky number too


456
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.802
and there is
so many references to that,


457
00:36:55.836 --> 00:36:57.370
so that became like a thing.

458
00:36:57.405 --> 00:36:59.739
And then
when I was googling him,


459
00:36:59.774 --> 00:37:02.342
what I found was that he
started a company...


460
00:37:02.376 --> 00:37:03.677
Don't tell me it had nine in it.

461
00:37:03.711 --> 00:37:05.111
- [Gwen] With nine in it.
- Oh.


462
00:37:05.146 --> 00:37:07.113
[Gwen] Something
that was meaningful...


463
00:37:07.148 --> 00:37:09.482
- That only you and him would recognize.
- [Gwen] Right.


464
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:12.152
Talk about being groomed,
like...


465
00:37:13.821 --> 00:37:15.755
It's just unbelievable
the depth of it


466
00:37:15.823 --> 00:37:20.460
- and how intricate it all became.
- [Gwen] Yes.


467
00:37:21.962 --> 00:37:25.165
You think it's about you,
it probably isn't.


468
00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:27.367
<i>It's kind of hard to admit,</i>

469
00:37:27.401 --> 00:37:30.036
especially if you're still

470
00:37:30.071 --> 00:37:31.805
in a very vulnerable place,
to say,


471
00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:33.673
"Oh, that guy
who was saying I'm so special,


472
00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:36.710
"yeah, he's a criminal. I'm actually
not that special." That sucks.


473
00:37:38.646 --> 00:37:42.315
<i>The letters, the gifts,
the many bike rides home.</i>


474
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.684
<i>He had become
a huge part of my life.</i>


475
00:37:45.986 --> 00:37:49.456
<i>But the crazy thing is,
after I left the swim team,</i>


476
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.992
<i>I completely forgot
that any of it ever happened.</i>


477
00:37:53.027 --> 00:37:55.528
<i>It's fascinating how the
minds can just block out</i>


478
00:37:55.563 --> 00:37:57.197
<i>what's too painful to remember,</i>

479
00:37:57.998 --> 00:37:59.499
<i>but then five years later,</i>

480
00:37:59.533 --> 00:38:01.468
<i>when I had my first boyfriend,</i>

481
00:38:01.535 --> 00:38:04.003
<i>I started to have nightmares.</i>

482
00:38:04.038 --> 00:38:06.940
<i>Every night I was in the
shower, I didn't recognize.</i>


483
00:38:07.908 --> 00:38:10.243
<i>It was months later
before I realized</i>


484
00:38:10.277 --> 00:38:12.445
<i>that those dreams
were actually a memory.</i>


485
00:38:13.581 --> 00:38:15.849
<i>And when it finally all
became clear,</i>


486
00:38:15.883 --> 00:38:17.717
<i>I wrote him a letter.</i>

487
00:38:17.752 --> 00:38:19.719
<i>I said,
"I'm not going to report you,</i>


488
00:38:19.754 --> 00:38:21.287
<i>but I want you to seek help."</i>

489
00:38:25.126 --> 00:38:26.893
<i>And, at some point,
I was walking the dog.</i>


490
00:38:26.927 --> 00:38:28.495
We were walking here

491
00:38:28.529 --> 00:38:31.030
and suddenly he had this red car

492
00:38:31.065 --> 00:38:34.367
and he just parked it.
Like this.


493
00:38:34.402 --> 00:38:36.870
In front of me and got out
of the car, and I...


494
00:38:36.904 --> 00:38:38.538
That's only the second time

495
00:38:38.572 --> 00:38:40.273
that I was ever
really scared of him


496
00:38:40.307 --> 00:38:43.209
and he just gets out and says,

497
00:38:43.244 --> 00:38:46.546
"I got your letter",
and he said,


498
00:38:46.614 --> 00:38:48.982
"You know that's a lie.
You know this was real love."


499
00:38:49.717 --> 00:38:50.750
And he turned around,

500
00:38:50.785 --> 00:38:52.352
went back into his car
and drove off.


501
00:38:52.386 --> 00:38:55.221
And that's the last time
I've ever seen him,


502
00:38:55.256 --> 00:38:57.524
but I remember in that moment
when he got out of the car


503
00:38:57.558 --> 00:38:58.391
I thought I was dead.

504
00:39:00.861 --> 00:39:04.731
[Harriet]<i>So you can see how</i>
<i>feeling sorry for the person,</i>


505
00:39:04.765 --> 00:39:07.767
and also doubting,
"maybe it was pure love."


506
00:39:07.802 --> 00:39:09.469
Of course you can confuse them.

507
00:39:12.973 --> 00:39:14.474
[Gwen]
So I'm starting to wonder,


508
00:39:14.508 --> 00:39:17.777
"Do I want to report
my offender or do I not?"


509
00:39:17.812 --> 00:39:20.814
And part
of why it's so difficult


510
00:39:20.848 --> 00:39:24.150
is, "Oh, maybe
it wasn't a big deal,"


511
00:39:24.185 --> 00:39:27.253
and, you know,
"I was... I never said no.


512
00:39:27.288 --> 00:39:28.488
I feel complicit."

513
00:39:30.324 --> 00:39:32.459
"Do I really want
to ruin his life?"


514
00:39:32.493 --> 00:39:34.093
[Dennis] Right. Well,

515
00:39:34.128 --> 00:39:36.229
he was very good at grooming

516
00:39:36.263 --> 00:39:38.565
because he groomed you
to think that.


517
00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:42.168
It puts a lot of confusion,
I think, in my mind


518
00:39:42.203 --> 00:39:43.169
because then I think,

519
00:39:43.204 --> 00:39:44.604
"He didn't realize it was wrong.

520
00:39:44.638 --> 00:39:45.605
He made a mistake,

521
00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:48.074
maybe I shouldn't throw him
under the bus."


522
00:39:48.108 --> 00:39:50.810
But, you know,
you saying things like,


523
00:39:50.845 --> 00:39:52.156
"It's not going to stop."

524
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.813
- Like, if you're...
- [Dennis] Right.


525
00:39:53.848 --> 00:39:56.015
You know, his sense of sexuality

526
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.650
is fully developed at that age,

527
00:39:57.685 --> 00:39:59.986
he's not going to suddenly
not be attracted to kids,


528
00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.154
that's not going to end.

529
00:40:01.188 --> 00:40:03.823
[Dennis] Oh, no.
I mean, it's not natural.


530
00:40:03.858 --> 00:40:05.225
24-year-old

531
00:40:05.259 --> 00:40:07.494
wants to get together
with a 12-year-old?


532
00:40:07.528 --> 00:40:09.295
Not unless he gets caught,
it won't end.


533
00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:10.830
Cause I know me.

534
00:40:12.166 --> 00:40:14.501
You know, I might have stopped
for a while,


535
00:40:14.535 --> 00:40:15.935
but sooner or later

536
00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.303
I would've found the right kid.

537
00:40:18.272 --> 00:40:22.642
My opinion, end it.
You'll feel better.

[Gwen]<i>The first time</i>

543
00:45:09.196 --> 00:45:10.763
<i>I remember something happening.</i>

544
00:45:13.767 --> 00:45:16.302
<i>We were at a camp
with the swim team</i>


545
00:45:17.704 --> 00:45:19.539
<i>and at some point
we were in a jacuzzi.</i>


546
00:45:20.808 --> 00:45:22.975
<i>Three or four kids
were sitting on one side</i>


547

<i>and he and I were sitting
on the other side.</i>


548
00:45:25.879 --> 00:45:27.513
<i>And we were just having
a conversation,</i>


549
00:45:27.548 --> 00:45:28.948
<i>we were having fun.</i>

550
00:45:28.982 --> 00:45:31.484
<i>We were just talking about
what 12-year-olds talk about.</i>


551
00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:36.189
<i>When he first touched me
I thought he made a mistake.</i>


552
00:45:36.223 --> 00:45:37.924
<i>I thought
he just touched me somewhere</i>


553
00:45:37.958 --> 00:45:39.225
<i>where he wasn't supposed to</i>

554
00:45:39.259 --> 00:45:41.994
<i>but that was because his hand
was there by accident.</i>


555
00:45:42.863 --> 00:45:43.863
<i>And then he kept going.</i>

556
00:45:45.432 --> 00:45:47.800
<i>And I remember
just being really confused.</i>


557
00:45:48.869 --> 00:45:49.769
<i>But I was trapped,</i>

558
00:45:50.938 --> 00:45:53.105
<i>and I remember sitting there
with a blank face</i>


559
00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.508
<i>and making sure
that nobody would see</i>


560
00:45:55.542 --> 00:45:57.476
<i>because I didn't want
to get him in trouble.</i>


561
00:45:59.112 --> 00:46:01.681
<i>And that was the first time
I vividly remember</i>


562
00:46:01.715 --> 00:46:03.349
<i>not wanting
to get him in trouble.</i>


563
00:46:12.993 --> 00:46:16.662
<i>They had to specifically know
what physically happened,</i>


564
00:46:16.697 --> 00:46:18.231
<i>and they were really validating.</i>

565
00:46:18.265 --> 00:46:20.333
It doesn't matter what you said

or what you thought
or how you felt,

how he felt, what he...
Doesn't matter.


568
00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:27.039
He is wrong. Period.

569
00:46:27.074 --> 00:46:28.808
And then there's
like a computer system


570
00:46:28.842 --> 00:46:30.643
where they put all the dates
and his age


571
00:46:30.677 --> 00:46:32.845
and his date of birth
or whatever,


572
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.550
what they know
and then it spits out the term


573
00:46:37.584 --> 00:46:39.185
and, like,
the cite of limitation


574
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.355
and on most things

575
00:46:42.389 --> 00:46:43.890
is like 5 years,

576

There's none. This is wrong.

he followed me.

602

00:49:10.937 --> 00:49:12.905
So I started playing and singing

615
00:49:12.939 --> 00:49:14.173
and he was playing his organ

616
00:49:14.207 --> 00:49:16.642
and pulling out different
sheet music to practice.


617
00:49:18.078 --> 00:49:20.780
And then at one point
he pulled out


618
00:49:20.814 --> 00:49:22.114
a pornographic magazine.

619
00:49:22.983 --> 00:49:24.750
He told me
that that was my lucky day


620
00:49:25.419 --> 00:49:26.685
<i>and then at one point</i>

621
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.656
I remember him grabbing me
by the back of my neck


622
00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:35.594
and pushing myself down
on top of him and, uh...


623
00:49:37.064 --> 00:49:42.501
I can remember feeling
like I was disconnecting


624
00:49:42.536 --> 00:49:44.236
from my body.

625
00:49:45.472 --> 00:49:48.774
<i>Feeling
like I was dying in a way.</i>


626
00:49:51.144 --> 00:49:55.047
20 years after the abuse
I was walking with my son


627
00:49:55.082 --> 00:49:57.183
through their part of the house

628
00:49:57.217 --> 00:50:00.686
and I remember
smelling his cologne


629
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.987
and just wanting to throw up.

630
00:50:03.056 --> 00:50:08.594
I had a flash
of my sister and me,


631
00:50:08.628 --> 00:50:11.897
5-years-old, in his bed

632
00:50:11.932 --> 00:50:15.768
and I see my little,
beautiful sister bouncing...


633
00:50:15.802 --> 00:50:19.572
He's bouncing her
but on this area


634
00:50:19.606 --> 00:50:23.175
<i>and you just hear her
crying and crying.</i>


635
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:30.216
[music]

636
00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.228
[videocall ringing]

637
00:53:21.688 --> 00:53:24.923
I'd call it
soul murder when you, um...


638
00:53:26.793 --> 00:53:30.162
when you attack a child
and when you rape a child.


639
00:53:31.331 --> 00:53:33.065
You leave the body intact,

640
00:53:33.099 --> 00:53:36.935
but the soul could quite
possibly be killed,


641
00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:38.904
destroyed, you know,

642
00:53:38.938 --> 00:53:40.873
it totally changed the chemistry

643
00:53:40.907 --> 00:53:43.776
in the child's brain,
they've proven.


644
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.211
Um, and you're not
the same person anymore


645
00:53:46.246 --> 00:53:47.212
once that happens.

646
00:53:47.247 --> 00:53:48.080
No.

647
00:53:58.892 --> 00:54:02.161
[Gwen] Yeah, I definitely
started to get sick here already.


648
00:54:02.195 --> 00:54:05.731
And then I think I lost
like 10-15 kilos after this.


649
00:54:07.567 --> 00:54:10.302
<i>"This afternoon on the boat
I was looking at my legs"</i>


650
00:54:10.337 --> 00:54:12.671
<i>and I just saw
two enormous pieces of meat.</i>


651
00:54:13.206 --> 00:54:15.374
So enormous", it says.

652
00:54:15.408 --> 00:54:17.810
And "So fat and so ugly."

653
00:54:17.844 --> 00:54:20.846
So now I feel the need
to stop eating


654
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.981
to get skinny, really skinny.

655
00:54:23.016 --> 00:54:24.516
No more needing to feel

656
00:54:24.584 --> 00:54:26.819
how I can be judged
for everything I do,


657
00:54:26.853 --> 00:54:29.655
for every move I make,
for every bite that I eat.


658
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:31.990
I want to be gone.

659
00:54:32.025 --> 00:54:33.158
"Gone. Gone."

660
00:54:34.627 --> 00:54:37.730
It's something I wrote
when I was anorexic.


661
00:54:39.065 --> 00:54:43.836
It was like a 5 year, 6 year
or whatever process and...


662
00:54:45.638 --> 00:54:47.706
But my therapist,
that's the one who...


663
00:54:48.975 --> 00:54:50.309
The guy told me,
the psychologist,


664
00:54:50.343 --> 00:54:52.010
psychiatrist, whatever,
and nothing worked


665
00:54:52.045 --> 00:54:54.813
and then she kind of...

666
00:54:56.182 --> 00:54:57.483
I feel like she just
understood me


667
00:54:57.517 --> 00:55:00.753
and just listened to me
and tried to forget


668
00:55:00.787 --> 00:55:03.021
about the eating all together

669
00:55:03.056 --> 00:55:04.390
and just let go of that,

670
00:55:04.424 --> 00:55:05.591
and of course we had to touch it

671
00:55:05.625 --> 00:55:06.892
every now and then, but,

672
00:55:07.427 --> 00:55:08.894
um, she was just like,

673
00:55:08.928 --> 00:55:10.996
"It's not about that,"
and that gave me...


674
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:12.030
That made me trust her,

675
00:55:12.065 --> 00:55:13.065
cause I felt like everybody

676
00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:15.401
was just trying to stuff food
down my throat,


677
00:55:15.435 --> 00:55:18.270
but she was trying to actually
understand what was going on.


678
00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:22.975
"I want to be so skinny that
there's nothing left of me."


679
00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.883
<i>I was 75 pound,
could barely go to school,</i>


680
00:55:30.917 --> 00:55:32.418
<i>and became too weak to swim.</i>

681
00:55:41.628 --> 00:55:44.329
[Keith]<i>I was suffering</i>
<i>from anorexia.</i>


682
00:55:44.364 --> 00:55:47.499
My life was, you know,
spinning out of control


683
00:55:47.534 --> 00:55:50.536
and, um, after the abuse ended,

684
00:55:50.603 --> 00:55:53.205
everything just kind of rose
to the surface


685
00:55:53.239 --> 00:55:55.441
so it resulted
in an eating disorder


686
00:55:55.475 --> 00:55:57.543
and severe depression,

687
00:55:57.577 --> 00:56:01.613
anxiety, you know,
night terrors, nightmares.


688
00:56:01.648 --> 00:56:06.285
There was all this going on
in my life at that time.


689
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.155
It made me physically sick.

690
00:56:10.223 --> 00:56:13.225
I've been in and out
of hospitals since then.


691
00:56:13.259 --> 00:56:16.795
Things I can't really
explain except for stress.


692
00:56:17.831 --> 00:56:19.832
I mean,
I was just in the hospital


693
00:56:19.866 --> 00:56:21.500
for two weeks.

694
00:56:21.534 --> 00:56:23.135
I mean, stress into stroke.

695
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:26.672
And I'm kind of young
for all that...


696
00:56:31.444 --> 00:56:32.945
[Denis] <i>After the molesting,</i>

697
00:56:32.979 --> 00:56:35.347
<i>the big thing is use the trust</i>

698
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:36.682
<i>to keep her quiet.</i>

699
00:56:40.687 --> 00:56:44.490
<i>This is secret,
don't tell anybody.</i>


700
00:56:44.524 --> 00:56:46.124
You don't want
to get grandpa in trouble.


701
00:56:46.159 --> 00:56:47.759
Then I won't see you anymore.

702
00:56:47.794 --> 00:56:49.495
You know,
we can't go and do things.


703
00:56:49.529 --> 00:56:51.330
You know, and I build that up
a little bit more.


704
00:56:51.364 --> 00:56:52.731
You know?

705
00:56:52.765 --> 00:56:55.667
Uh, but getting somebody
to tell you something


706
00:56:55.702 --> 00:56:57.603
that she hasn't told
anybody else


707
00:56:57.637 --> 00:56:59.438
or he hasn't told anybody else

708
00:56:59.472 --> 00:57:01.006
and then holding that,

709
00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:04.176
you know, so that you know
that if you ever tell on me,


710
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:05.677
I'm going to tell on you.

711
00:57:05.712 --> 00:57:07.513
I go back and forth
on everything,


712
00:57:07.547 --> 00:57:09.648
he explicitly said,

713
00:57:09.682 --> 00:57:11.884
"don't tell anyone,
you need to keep it a secret."


714
00:57:11.918 --> 00:57:14.052
But it was...
It was just really clear


715
00:57:14.087 --> 00:57:15.587
that it was supposed
to be a secret.


716
00:57:15.622 --> 00:57:17.689
I don't know how I knew
or why I knew,


717
00:57:17.724 --> 00:57:19.525
but I knew to not say anything.

718
00:57:19.559 --> 00:57:21.326
[Barbi] Like,
why didn't I say anything?


719
00:57:21.361 --> 00:57:23.529
They must've said
something to me


720
00:57:23.563 --> 00:57:26.098
to convince me
not to say something.


721
00:57:27.066 --> 00:57:28.500
They start with little secrets,

722
00:57:28.535 --> 00:57:30.836
they're testing to see
if you'll keep the secret.


723
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:32.738
- Oh, interesting.
- So it might be


724
00:57:32.772 --> 00:57:34.339
that he takes you some place

725
00:57:34.374 --> 00:57:35.707
that you weren't supposed to go

726
00:57:35.742 --> 00:57:37.643
or gives you a little tiny gift

727
00:57:37.677 --> 00:57:40.245
that he can explain away
if it ever comes to light.


728
00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.648
And so there's
this building up to secrecy.


729
00:57:42.682 --> 00:57:45.484
You start with ones, you test.
"Okay, will he hold that one."


730
00:57:45.518 --> 00:57:48.921
Then "will he hold that one?"
That's grooming. Straight up.


731
00:57:48.955 --> 00:57:53.792
He started putting extra money
in my pay checks every week.


732
00:57:53.826 --> 00:57:56.328
He would say, "Oh, just
don't tell anyone about this.


733
00:57:56.362 --> 00:57:58.030
This is
just between me and you."


734
00:57:58.064 --> 00:58:00.399
I just remember him
always saying


735
00:58:00.433 --> 00:58:02.134
"Don't trust other people.

736
00:58:02.168 --> 00:58:03.402
Don't talk to other people

737
00:58:03.436 --> 00:58:05.537
about what happens
in the house."


738
00:58:05.572 --> 00:58:09.608
My dad asked
why I didn't tell him...


739
00:58:23.456 --> 00:58:26.058
I had to keep telling myself,
"Okay, I'm a good girl.


740
00:58:26.092 --> 00:58:26.959
I'm a good girl.

741
00:58:26.993 --> 00:58:29.261
I'm still a good girl,
it's okay.


742
00:58:29.295 --> 00:58:31.263
I'm okay. I'll be okay."

743
00:58:33.099 --> 00:58:34.766
But for some reason I just...

744
00:58:36.669 --> 00:58:40.472
I felt like I shamed
the family somehow.


745
00:58:41.574 --> 00:58:42.841
So I didn't want
to talk about it.


746
01:00:07.627 --> 01:00:14.633
[typing]

747
01:00:19.839 --> 01:00:24.976
Whoever is a sex offender
is going to deny.


748
01:00:25.878 --> 01:00:27.479
They're great at lying,

749
01:00:27.513 --> 01:00:28.880
they're the best at lying

750
01:00:28.915 --> 01:00:30.449
and it's funny
because when I was younger


751
01:00:30.483 --> 01:00:31.983
that's when I started lying.

752
01:00:32.018 --> 01:00:34.453
"Did you do that?"
"No, I didn't do it."


753
01:00:34.487 --> 01:00:37.756
As I went through life
it got easier, you know?


754
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:41.727
And it just got to be
a part of my being, I guess.


755
01:00:44.197 --> 01:00:46.298
The part of me that is groomed

756
01:00:46.332 --> 01:00:48.867
would expect him to be arrested,

757
01:00:48.901 --> 01:00:53.872
go in and say,
"I'm so sorry that I hurt her."


758
01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.975
I never intended to do so.

759
01:00:57.009 --> 01:01:00.479
I really loved her,
cared for her,


760
01:01:00.513 --> 01:01:02.748
and I'm so sorry to hear

761
01:01:02.782 --> 01:01:05.250
"that this is the impact
that it's had on her."


762
01:01:05.284 --> 01:01:08.086
That would be consistent
with the person that I saw


763
01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:12.324
and the person that portrayer
care for me and love for me.


764
01:01:12.358 --> 01:01:14.593
He is taking a stance
against me,


765
01:01:15.561 --> 01:01:17.929
makes me see
a different side of him


766
01:01:17.964 --> 01:01:20.198
and it's almost
like he's ungrooming me


767
01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:22.868
in a way, it's making me see

768
01:01:22.902 --> 01:01:24.703
he maybe more for what he is

769
01:01:24.737 --> 01:01:26.838
versus how he portrayed himself

770
01:01:26.873 --> 01:01:28.240
towards me for all those years.

771
01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:32.344
That's just exactly
why it's good


772
01:01:32.378 --> 01:01:33.578
to have the knowledge

773
01:01:33.613 --> 01:01:37.115
of maybe you've seen two sides
of the person.


774
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:41.720
That helps.
That helps to clear confusion.


775
01:01:42.755 --> 01:01:43.889
He doesn't even want to admit

776
01:01:43.923 --> 01:01:45.791
to have sent me the letter,
are you kidding me?


777
01:01:46.392 --> 01:01:53.398
[music]

778
01:02:00.873 --> 01:02:07.045
I got pregnant as a result
of the abuse of my father.


779
01:02:07.814 --> 01:02:08.713
Um...

780
01:02:11.717 --> 01:02:13.051
<i>I was 15.</i>

781
01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:19.157
<i>He tried a natural remedy
for an abortion.</i>


782
01:02:19.192 --> 01:02:23.295
Aspirin mixed
with some other things


783
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:27.966
and that then
led to him taking me


784
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.434
to an abortion clinic

785
01:02:31.037 --> 01:02:36.274
when I was pretty far along
in the pregnancy


786
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:40.812
and I was awake while
the procedure happened.


787
01:02:42.148 --> 01:02:43.381
He even said,

788
01:02:44.383 --> 01:02:46.685
"You should be thankful

789
01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:49.154
that your dad brought you here,

790
01:02:49.188 --> 01:02:51.957
there's not a lot of parents
who would do that."


791
01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:54.125
Um...

792
01:02:57.196 --> 01:02:58.864
That moment I think shaped

793
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.500
the beginning of me, like,

794
01:03:02.535 --> 01:03:06.338
really separating
in a way from him.


795
01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:14.880
<i>He got a sentence of 20 years.</i>

796
01:03:16.015 --> 01:03:18.516
[Gwen] How did it feel
when he was convicted?


797
01:03:44.043 --> 01:03:45.176
[Denis] <i>I just got off of work,</i>

798
01:03:45.211 --> 01:03:46.745
<i>it was 6 o'clock in the morning</i>

799
01:03:47.413 --> 01:03:49.147
<i>and as I was driving home,</i>

800
01:03:49.181 --> 01:03:51.917
whoever was on back on me,
kept following me.


801
01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:53.418
And I started to get nervous.

802
01:03:53.452 --> 01:03:55.520
When I came around,
I pulled on my driveway,


803
01:03:56.555 --> 01:03:58.890
in front of me there's
the state police.


804
01:03:58.925 --> 01:04:00.692
Federal officers.

805
01:04:00.726 --> 01:04:01.793
I'm like,
"How am I going to lie?


806
01:04:01.827 --> 01:04:02.928
What am I going to say?"

807
01:04:02.962 --> 01:04:05.530
I didn't even think
about what I did yet, I mean,


808
01:04:05.564 --> 01:04:07.465
I did it, but now
I want to get out of it.


809
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.301
I sat down with my head
between my legs


810
01:04:09.335 --> 01:04:12.504
and I though,
"My God what did I do?"


811
01:04:13.506 --> 01:04:14.506
You know, "What's..."

812
01:04:16.275 --> 01:04:17.475
I'm thinking of prison,

813
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:20.078
the bars and these crazy guys
that are there.


814
01:04:20.112 --> 01:04:21.680
I mean, all these things
went through my head


815
01:04:22.615 --> 01:04:24.115
and I get a call,

816
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:25.951
and I'm thinking
"Who is this now?"


817
01:04:25.985 --> 01:04:26.885
I answered it

818
01:04:26.919 --> 01:04:28.954
and it was
my step-granddaughter.


819
01:04:28.988 --> 01:04:29.955
She's the one I molested.

820
01:04:29.989 --> 01:04:31.623
She says, "Grandpa," you know,

821
01:04:31.657 --> 01:04:32.490
"I'm sorry

822
01:04:33.659 --> 01:04:36.094
that I had to get you
in trouble."


823
01:04:36.128 --> 01:04:37.295
You know? I mean, see?

824
01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:39.064
The lies I told her,

825
01:04:39.098 --> 01:04:41.433
she was actually feeling
so much guilt


826
01:04:41.901 --> 01:04:43.368
because of that.

827
01:04:43.402 --> 01:04:45.603
You know,
she was apologizing for,


828
01:04:45.638 --> 01:04:47.005
you know, doing the right thing.

829
01:07:39.478 --> 01:07:40.745
I want to share something
with you


830
01:07:40.779 --> 01:07:42.380
that happened this morning.

831
01:07:43.716 --> 01:07:44.549
Um...

832
01:07:45.951 --> 01:07:47.318
You're, like, the second person

833
01:07:47.386 --> 01:07:48.586
that I'm telling,

834
01:07:48.621 --> 01:07:51.556
and I got an e-mail this morning

835
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:55.493
completely out of nowhere
from a girl in the same team


836
01:07:55.828 --> 01:07:56.794
who said,

837
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:58.897
"Are you talking
about this person?


838
01:07:58.931 --> 01:08:00.165
Cause this happened to me."

839
01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.334
And it just, I don't know.

840
01:08:03.369 --> 01:08:04.702
It just broke my heart,
you know?


841
01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:09.674
But I think
I've never been prouder


842
01:08:09.708 --> 01:08:12.510
that I reported or proud
of anything I've done,


843
01:08:12.545 --> 01:08:14.979
maybe, after when I got
that e-mail


844
01:08:15.014 --> 01:08:16.091
I just thought
I did the right thing,


845
01:08:16.115 --> 01:08:17.115
you know?

846
01:08:18.217 --> 01:08:22.654
I would be interested
in hearing your process


847
01:08:22.688 --> 01:08:25.890
of how you did that because
I've never reported anything.


848
01:08:25.925 --> 01:08:27.992
I think for everybody
the process is different


849
01:08:28.027 --> 01:08:29.394
and what is right is different.

850
01:08:29.428 --> 01:08:30.662
I don't think there is an answer

851
01:08:30.696 --> 01:08:32.330
for everybody that's the same.

852
01:08:32.364 --> 01:08:34.132
But in my case, it was hard.

853
01:08:34.166 --> 01:08:36.868
It was so hard to talk about it

854
01:08:36.902 --> 01:08:38.469
and to go through the question.

855
01:08:38.504 --> 01:08:39.671
They told me
that if this happened


856
01:08:39.705 --> 01:08:42.006
it is a crime
and a really serious one.


857
01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:46.544
[sobbing]

858
01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:01.693
Now I feel
more motivated also to go


859
01:09:01.727 --> 01:09:05.263
and appeal
and tell the prosecutor


860
01:09:05.297 --> 01:09:06.397
that they're wrong. It's like,

861
01:09:06.432 --> 01:09:08.099
"You've got to get this guy
off the street."


862
01:09:09.501 --> 01:09:10.602
I didn't really
feel that before.


863
01:09:10.636 --> 01:09:12.971
Before I was, "Oh, I didn't
validate me a little bit.


864
01:09:13.005 --> 01:09:14.272
Maybe I didn't want
to take it seriously,


865
01:09:14.306 --> 01:09:15.540
then you start feeling like,
doing it."


866
01:09:15.574 --> 01:09:17.809
Now, I'm like "Go get this guy.

867
01:09:17.843 --> 01:09:18.943
Go get him now."

868
01:09:26.418 --> 01:09:28.386
<i>I was told
that to have any chance</i>


869
01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.256
<i>of reopening my case
I needed to do two things,</i>


870
01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:33.691
try to get DNA on the letters.

871
01:09:33.726 --> 01:09:35.059
Even though the prosecutors

872
01:09:35.094 --> 01:09:36.394
said they couldn't find any DNA,

873
01:09:36.428 --> 01:09:37.629
try to find it,

874
01:09:37.663 --> 01:09:40.265
<i>and then try to get
a handwriting sample from him</i>


875
01:09:40.299 --> 01:09:42.767
<i>to match to the writing
of the letters.</i>


876
01:09:42.801 --> 01:09:45.603
<i>As a first step
I took the letters to a lab.</i>


877
01:09:45.638 --> 01:09:47.105
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you, thank you.


878
01:09:47.139 --> 01:09:48.239
- Follow me.
- Thank you.


879
01:09:50.009 --> 01:09:51.976
[Gwen]<i>We are looking</i>
<i>for a second opinion.</i>


880
01:09:52.011 --> 01:09:54.479
We have evidence
in the form of letters,


881
01:09:54.513 --> 01:09:57.448
but they're not able to match
the suspect to the letters.


882
01:09:57.483 --> 01:09:58.983
And so what we want
to try and see


883
01:09:59.018 --> 01:10:00.118
is there really no DNA,

884
01:10:00.152 --> 01:10:02.420
cause we still have
the stamp on the card.


885
01:10:02.454 --> 01:10:04.389
Does that mean
that the stamp was no tested?


886
01:10:04.423 --> 01:10:05.423
Would you take it out?

887
01:10:05.457 --> 01:10:08.126
Usually if we would test
the stamp on DNA


888
01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.761
then we would,
indeed take it out.


889
01:10:09.795 --> 01:10:11.262
Especially
if it's an old letter,


890
01:10:11.297 --> 01:10:13.631
maybe the person
who left the DNA licked it.


891
01:10:13.666 --> 01:10:15.633
- Mm-hmmm.
- And it's well isolated


892
01:10:15.668 --> 01:10:18.836
on the card so it would be one
of the best places to start.


893
01:10:19.672 --> 01:10:21.639
So is my DNA
going to be all over?


894
01:10:21.674 --> 01:10:23.608
Your DNA is definitely
going to be there


895
01:10:23.642 --> 01:10:24.876
- if you touched it.
- Right.


896
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:26.077
So I think it would be best

897
01:10:26.111 --> 01:10:27.812
if we take a reference sample
of you too.


898
01:10:33.085 --> 01:10:35.820
It takes about four weeks
until we send the answer.

Hey.

902
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:19.997
[Gwen]<i>Raimondo told me</i>
<i>it would probably</i>


903
01:11:20.032 --> 01:11:21.332
<i>take a while before he would get</i>

<i>But in the meantime,</i>

906
01:11:26.038 --> 01:11:27.271
<i>he found out that my offender</i>

907

<i>lives just five minutes away
from my parents house.</i>


908
01:11:31.176 --> 01:11:33.845
<i>He had blacked out
all his windows.</i>


909
01:11:33.879 --> 01:11:36.314
<i>He never married
and he doesn't have a family.</i>


910
01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:40.184
<i>He found out that he remained</i>

911
01:11:40.219 --> 01:11:42.887
<i>at the swim club for years
after I left,</i>


912

<i>and as recently
as three years ago</i>


913

<i>he was working at summer camps.</i>

914
01:11:50.696 --> 01:11:52.029
I'm a little nervous.

915
01:11:52.064 --> 01:11:54.432
Well should I get straight
to the point then?


916
01:11:54.466 --> 01:11:58.069
Yes. Let's do it the Dutch way
and get straight to the point.


917
01:11:58.871 --> 01:12:00.872
Okay. So as we investigated

918
01:12:00.906 --> 01:12:03.241
five of your letters
that you gave


919
01:12:04.476 --> 01:12:09.247
and we found two profiles,
one female profile,


920
01:12:10.115 --> 01:12:12.417
which was yours

921
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:14.452
and so there was one other
profile too.


922
01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.088
And is it a male profile?

923
01:12:17.122 --> 01:12:19.357
Unfortunately,
I'm not able to say


924
01:12:19.391 --> 01:12:20.725

- Same profile


927
01:12:25.631 --> 01:12:27.265
on three different items.

928
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:29.000
Yeah.

929
01:12:29.034 --> 01:12:30.268
That's really good news.

930
01:12:31.703 --> 01:12:32.670
Yeah.

931
01:12:32.704 --> 01:12:33.838
It's a great result,

932
01:12:33.872 --> 01:12:35.606
especially after such
a long time


933
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:37.008
that we were able
to find something.


934
01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:39.877
It was rather quite
a clear profile.


935
01:12:39.912 --> 01:12:42.346
It's really good news, so...

936
01:12:42.381 --> 01:12:44.015
Yeah, I think
it's the best result


937
01:12:44.049 --> 01:12:45.116
that you could've hoped for.

938

Thank you.

939
01:12:46.785 --> 01:12:48.219
- Okay.
- Have a good day.


940
01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:02.667
I have zero...
There's zero part of me

01:13:02.701 --> 01:13:04.469
that feels bad for him.

942
01:13:04.503 --> 01:13:06.370
Literally, there's nothing.

<i>After weeks of surveillance,</i>

944
01:13:13.512 --> 01:13:15.480

[music]

954
01:15:28.981 --> 01:15:33.284
It feels a little bit
like a point in time


955
01:15:33.318 --> 01:15:36.787
where I have now truly done
everything I can


956
01:15:36.822 --> 01:15:40.591
and there's no possible move
for me to make


957
01:15:40.626 --> 01:15:43.194
<i>other than going
to the prosecutor and saying,</i>


958
01:15:43.228 --> 01:15:44.629
<i>"This is everything we found."</i>

959

<i>That's all we can ask for.</i>

962
01:15:49.101 --> 01:15:50.534
I don't want him to be out there

963
01:15:50.569 --> 01:15:52.737
and just be able to do
whatever he wants


964
01:15:52.771 --> 01:15:55.139
and go to summer camps
just because nobody

<i>Now we have to wait and see.</i>

967
01:16:10.589 --> 01:16:13.290
[Denis] I'll probably
never stop crying about it,


968
01:16:14.026 --> 01:16:15.693
but I understand
it a lot better.


969
01:16:15.727 --> 01:16:18.195
I can't change the past
and what I did,


970
01:16:19.231 --> 01:16:20.965
so if you're going
to evaluate me,


971
01:16:20.999 --> 01:16:22.833
evaluate before you see now.

972
01:16:22.868 --> 01:16:23.801
You know that kind of thing?

973
01:16:24.736 --> 01:16:26.370
I want to be that better person

974
01:16:26.405 --> 01:16:27.872
and I know I am,

975
01:16:27.906 --> 01:16:30.408
but I still have
those thoughts, you know?


976
01:16:31.543 --> 01:16:32.977
That I did do that.

977
01:16:53.665 --> 01:16:54.732
Tell me how you're feeling.

978
01:17:09.614 --> 01:17:11.048
And one thing
we talked about a lot


979
01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:14.018
is the need to separate
the healing process


980
01:17:14.052 --> 01:17:15.453
from the legal process.

981
01:17:15.487 --> 01:17:17.688
That's one of the biggest
learnings I've had.


982
01:17:17.723 --> 01:17:20.558
You know, if nobody validates me

983
01:17:20.592 --> 01:17:22.093
and if he never goes to jail

984
01:17:22.127 --> 01:17:24.695
or if he'd never gotten arrested

985
01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:26.897
that doesn't mean
that I can't heal.


986
01:17:26.932 --> 01:17:28.399
I feel better. 
I feel stronger.

As the abuse ended,

1001
01:17:59.965 --> 01:18:03.634
I had a very difficult time

1002
01:18:03.668 --> 01:18:07.338
connecting with my own
first name, Keith


1003
01:18:07.372 --> 01:18:11.742
because my first abuser,
his name was Keith.


1004
01:18:11.777 --> 01:18:13.778
And so I used
my grandparent's name.


1005
01:18:15.113 --> 01:18:17.581
35 years I've been using
that name


1006
01:18:17.616 --> 01:18:19.416
and it's only recently

1007
01:18:19.451 --> 01:18:21.886
that I've been able
to feel more comfortable


1008
01:18:22.687 --> 01:18:24.088
with my name

1009
01:18:24.122 --> 01:18:28.058
and having been able
to integrate


1010
01:18:28.093 --> 01:18:30.227
full three names,
now I feel complete.


1011
01:18:30.262 --> 01:18:32.429
Now I use Keith Renard Brennen.

1012
01:18:33.999 --> 01:18:35.933
And feel comfortable with that.

1013
01:18:35.967 --> 01:18:38.669
I try to put myself
in a position


1014
01:18:38.703 --> 01:18:40.971
where childhood abuse,
that whole experience,


1015
01:18:41.006 --> 01:18:42.773
was the worst part of my life.

1016
01:18:42.807 --> 01:18:45.843
There seems to be
a future beyond


1017
01:18:46.711 --> 01:18:49.180
trying to outlive pain.

1018
01:18:49.214 --> 01:18:52.783
I mean, whether like
dream more about my life.


1019
