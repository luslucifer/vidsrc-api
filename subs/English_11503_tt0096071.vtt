00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.367
<i>Allez avec bon Dieu.</i>

2
00:04:47.214 --> 00:04:48.412
Christophe!

3
00:04:54.847 --> 00:04:55.961
Christophe!

4
00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:00.931
Christophe!

5
00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:04.435
Christophe!

6
00:05:22.374 --> 00:05:26.538
<i>Field notes. Dr Dennis Alan,
Rio Negro Botanical Expedition...</i>


7
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.292
<i>August 15, 1985.</i>

8
00:05:29.423 --> 00:05:31.712
<i>At the clearing of the
shaman An Hango...</i>


9
00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:35.710
<i>regarded as the most powerful
spiritual man in the Amazon.</i>


10
00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:40.260
<i>There's something strange in the air
today. Even my pilot's nervous.</i>


11
00:05:40.393 --> 00:05:44.723
<i>If I were superstitious, I'd say that
something was closing in on me.</i>


12
00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:48.691
<i>The shaman senses it too. He decides,
in his own off-the-wall way...</i>


13
00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:50.565
<i>to show me what it is.</i>

14
00:05:51.278 --> 00:05:54.778
Tell him I'm very appreciative.
Harvard thanks him.


15
00:05:54.907 --> 00:05:59.236
His potions will make a good medicine
that will be helpful for many people.


16
00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.085
Now he wants you to drink it. He says
he has something he wants you to see.


17
00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:13.465
You know what you'll see if you
drink that shit? Stars, amigo.


18
00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:16.131
Let's get outta here.

19
00:06:25.397 --> 00:06:27.770
Like I said, for the road.

20
00:06:34.574 --> 00:06:37.444
It's good. It's very good.

21
00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:40.575
Thank you.

22
00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:21.325
Agh!

23
00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:25.474
No! No!

24
00:08:26.062 --> 00:08:28.101
Stop!

25
00:09:05.603 --> 00:09:07.642
Hello?

26
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.442
Julio!

27
00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:40.509
Hey. I thought
you'd taken off without me.


28
00:09:40.638 --> 00:09:43.473
I owe you one, pal.

29
00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:04.485
<i>Something much more evil and powerful
than the shaman or his men...</i>


30
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:06.863
<i>has killed my pilot.</i>

31
00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:12.708
<i>I know this as clearly as I feel the
darkness and cold closing in on me.</i>


32
00:11:23.242 --> 00:11:25.282
Hey.

33
00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:28.908
Hey! Hey!

34
00:11:37.216 --> 00:11:38.211
Agh!

35
00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:51.271
<i>I'm only home for a week when I get a
call from my old professor and friend...</i>


36
00:11:51.397 --> 00:11:53.437
<i>Earl Schoonbacher.</i>

37
00:11:53.608 --> 00:11:56.016
<i>He's a consultant for a
pharmaceutical company...</i>


38
00:11:56.151 --> 00:11:58.903
<i>and says he has an
interesting job offer.</i>


39
00:12:03.575 --> 00:12:07.739
Ah, Dennis. This is Dr Cassedy,
the head of Boston Biocorp.


40
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:10.327
- How do you do, sir?
- Hi, how do you do?


41
00:12:10.457 --> 00:12:12.331
Boy, it's a pleasure.

42
00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:16.292
I'm impressed. 200 miles
through the Amazon, on foot, alone?


43
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:20.415
Not alone. They showed him
his animal spirit, his totem.


44
00:12:20.552 --> 00:12:23.506
The jaguar guided him
back to us, safe and sound.


45
00:12:23.638 --> 00:12:26.473
Well, we here at Boston Biocorp...

46
00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:30.430
we deal in science
and medicine, not magic.


47
00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:33.681
So whether you came by Jaguar
or Mercedes-Benz, who cares?


48
00:12:33.815 --> 00:12:37.480
What I care about is you came back
with plants and native medicines...


49
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.650
that no one has
been able to collect.


50
00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:41.903
What do you know
about zombification?


51
00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:44.523
- Pardon me?
- Zombification?


52
00:12:45.536 --> 00:12:48.157
The process of making zombies.
The living dead.


53
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:50.494
<i>Just what I've seen
on the Late Show.</i>


54
00:12:51.207 --> 00:12:56.368
This is the death certificate
of Christophe Durand...


55
00:12:57.088 --> 00:12:59.709
and the doctor's report.

56
00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:05.001
Mr. Durand displayed negative pulse,
no heartbeat, no respirations...


57
00:13:05.138 --> 00:13:10.429
no pupil dilation, no brain waves,
no response to pain, and he was buried.


58
00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:14.932
He was put into a coffin...
and buried.


59
00:13:15.357 --> 00:13:17.895
The date on that certificate
is seven years ago.


60
00:13:18.027 --> 00:13:23.317
This photograph was taken one week
ago at a clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.


61
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:28.823
That man is Christophe Durand.
The same, and very much alive.


62
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.620
Maybe Durand had a twin.

63
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.208
No.

64
00:13:33.335 --> 00:13:36.039
Hospital error. You know,
right name, wrong corpse.


65
00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:37.120
No.

66
00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:41.538
No, we had it verified by Dr Duchamp -
the one who sent us the photographs.


67
00:13:41.884 --> 00:13:44.505
If you don't like "zombie",
choose another word.


68
00:13:44.637 --> 00:13:47.887
But the fact is that somebody
brought him back from the grave.


69
00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:50.304
And I wanna know...
how they did it.


70
00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:58.519
- You really believe this?
- The Haitians surely do.


71
00:14:00.237 --> 00:14:02.478
A drug.

72
00:14:02.614 --> 00:14:05.366
It has to be a drug then, right?

73
00:14:05.492 --> 00:14:08.065
Anesthesia.
That's what I was thinking.


74
00:14:08.203 --> 00:14:11.204
A new anesthetic that could
revolutionize medicine.


75
00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:13.952
Now, what if this zombie drug
could be discovered?


76
00:14:14.084 --> 00:14:17.250
40-50,000 lives a year
are lost on the operating table...


77
00:14:17.379 --> 00:14:20.664
not because of surgery,
but because of anesthetic shock.


78
00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:25.129
40-50,000 lives a year could be
saved in the US alone, Doctor.


79
00:14:25.304 --> 00:14:28.222
And more worldwide,
if properly marketed.


80
00:14:28.808 --> 00:14:31.346
It could be
more complicated than drugs.


81
00:14:31.477 --> 00:14:34.560
It could be the proof,
perhaps, of the soul.


82
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.897
Come on, Schoonie,
where is the location of the soul?


83
00:14:38.024 --> 00:14:40.598
Under the hood?
Next to the battery?


84
00:14:40.735 --> 00:14:44.104
No, the soul begins
and ends with the brain.


85
00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:47.609
This drug, this is
something totally new.


86
00:14:48.369 --> 00:14:53.114
We don't have anything that can put
somebody in, then back out, of death.


87
00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:56.667
And all we gotta do is...
go and get it.


88
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.504
<i>This is one of the
poorest countries in the world.</i>


89
00:15:05.636 --> 00:15:10.179
<i>It has revolution in the air. It's got
a ruthless dictator in the palace.</i>


90
00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:13.725
<i>So I had expected a certain
sense of oppression.</i>


91
00:15:13.854 --> 00:15:17.305
<i>But I hadn't expected that the
dark presence from the Amazon...</i>


92
00:15:17.441 --> 00:15:19.848
<i>would instantly
come over me here...</i>


93
00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:23.401
<i>as real as a cold hand
falling on my shoulder.</i>


94
00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:27.986
<i>And I also didn't expect
Dr. Duchamp to look like...</i>


95
00:15:28.117 --> 00:15:30.738
<i>Dr Duchamp did.</i>

96
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.277
<i>- Dr Duchamp?
- Bonjour.</i>


97
00:15:34.248 --> 00:15:38.247
<i>- Bonjour, je m'appelle...
- Dennis Alan, I know.</i>


98
00:15:38.587 --> 00:15:41.504
Yes, I guess I am
an easy face in this crowd.


99
00:15:41.632 --> 00:15:44.301
Oh, I would have
known you even in...


100
00:15:45.093 --> 00:15:48.462
- Excuse me?
- It would be better if we talk inside.


101
00:15:53.143 --> 00:15:56.429
Those were the Tontons Macoutes.
They know you are here, of course.


102
00:16:06.324 --> 00:16:08.696
Are you sure handcuffs
are the best idea here?


103
00:16:08.826 --> 00:16:11.911
500 patients,
three doctors, 15 nurses.


104
00:16:14.165 --> 00:16:16.490
A week's supply of Thorazine.

105
00:16:17.502 --> 00:16:22.744
Handcuffs are the only thing Duvalier
makes sure Haiti has enough of.


106
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:25.372
This is Margrite.

107
00:16:26.177 --> 00:16:29.178
- I was expecting...
- After an illness of three days...


108
00:16:29.305 --> 00:16:32.010
Margrite died and was buried
in a village ceremony.


109
00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:34.977
No death certificate,
but we have witnesses.


110
00:16:35.103 --> 00:16:37.095
That was 15 years ago.

111
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.310
Last August, she was found
wandering in the marketplace.


112
00:16:41.442 --> 00:16:43.980
Her brother identified her
by a birthmark.


113
00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:46.818
A classic zombie.

114
00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.488
<i>Bonjour, Margrite.</i>

115
00:16:58.043 --> 00:17:01.744
<i>Est-ce Que Tu Te rappelles
Ce qui t'est arrivé?</i>


116
00:17:13.808 --> 00:17:17.012
Well, she sure can't
tell us anything.


117
00:17:17.146 --> 00:17:20.930
I understand Christophe Durand,
the man whose death certificate I saw...


118
00:17:21.066 --> 00:17:23.474
he can speak, right?
- Yes.


119
00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:29.281
He even speaks English. Christophe is
unique. Much of his memory is intact.


120
00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:32.359
I'd like to see him right away.

121
00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:38.907
<i>A warning,
that's what I felt in those eyes.</i>


122
00:17:39.543 --> 00:17:43.209
<i>I didn't know of what,
but it chilled me to the bone.</i>


123
00:17:51.681 --> 00:17:56.224
<i>Marielle took me to see a man who was
very powerful in politics and in voodoo.</i>


124
00:17:56.353 --> 00:18:01.595
<i>He's a full voodoo priest, but he
also runs a nightclub for tourists.</i>


125
00:18:01.733 --> 00:18:06.146
<i>In fact, Lucien Celine does a bit of
everything, except give out information.</i>


126
00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:08.319
You've come on a good
night, Monsieur.


127
00:18:08.448 --> 00:18:11.200
Tonight the spirits are happy.

128
00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:16.239
We asked about Christophe Durand.

129
00:18:16.373 --> 00:18:20.620
Lucien, why are you being so difficult?
You have people all over the island.


130
00:18:20.752 --> 00:18:23.077
Someone must have seen
Christophe by now.


131
00:18:23.213 --> 00:18:28.338
Perhaps. But what people see and
what they say are very different matters.


132
00:18:29.386 --> 00:18:32.388
Haiti is full of
contradictions, Dr Alan.


133
00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:37.509
These dancers, for instance, they
don't bleed and they don't burn.


134
00:18:43.943 --> 00:18:48.404
Tonight we are calling down
Erzulie, the goddess of love.


135
00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:51.200
- You will dance tonight?
- No, Lucien, I will not.


136
00:18:51.325 --> 00:18:53.567
- You will.
- No.


137
00:18:54.579 --> 00:18:58.244
- You all right?
- You have business to discuss.


138
00:18:58.374 --> 00:19:02.288
If he won't help, we'll go
to Christophe's village tomorrow.


139
00:19:03.462 --> 00:19:06.547
She'll be fine. 
She'll be fine.

140
00:19:27.487 --> 00:19:29.112
Agh!

141
00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:33.321
Yes, he is the one to watch.

142
00:19:33.452 --> 00:19:38.956
<i>Captain Peytraud. He plays at
being a bokor, a black magician.</i>


143
00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:42.668
He is beneath contempt.

144
00:19:43.378 --> 00:19:46.962
He is the Chief of the Tontons
Macoutes, Duvalier's secret police.


145
00:19:47.383 --> 00:19:49.505
You have seen him
before perhaps, hm?


146
00:19:50.385 --> 00:19:53.754
- Yeah, someplace.
- Be careful, my friend.


147
00:19:54.431 --> 00:19:59.223
In Haiti, there are secrets
we keep even from ourselves.


148
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.016
Hey.

149
00:20:07.694 --> 00:20:11.195
- Marielle.
- Yes, favorite of Erzulie.


150
00:20:48.152 --> 00:20:52.399
For Marielle, possession
is as natural as breathing.


151
00:21:16.015 --> 00:21:18.173
Argh!

152
00:21:35.868 --> 00:21:37.907
Watch it.

153
00:21:41.415 --> 00:21:43.455
Are you all right?

154
00:21:54.721 --> 00:21:58.055
<i>Marielle never mentioned what
had happened the night before.</i>


155
00:21:58.183 --> 00:22:02.644
<i>But from what I knew of possession,
she probably didn't even remember it.</i>


156
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:05.522
<i>Maybe it was just as well.</i>

157
00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:10.227
<i>We asked in Christophe's village, but not
even the voodoo priestess would help.</i>


158
00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:13.316
I told you, he is dead.

159
00:22:13.448 --> 00:22:15.571
What should I know about the dead?

160
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.781
<i>The whereabouts of Christophe remained
a mystery, until his sister found us.</i>


161
00:22:19.914 --> 00:22:22.487
<i>Le cimetière.</i>

162
00:22:26.753 --> 00:22:28.793
Let's go.

163
00:22:52.071 --> 00:22:56.021
What his sister said makes sense.
Christophe is obsessed with death.


164
00:22:56.158 --> 00:22:57.321
<i>We will find him.</i>

165
00:22:57.451 --> 00:23:00.903
That's what you said
about the last three graveyards.


166
00:23:11.842 --> 00:23:13.881
Christophe?

167
00:23:17.431 --> 00:23:19.469
Christophe!

168
00:23:21.183 --> 00:23:23.223
Christophe!

169
00:23:35.908 --> 00:23:37.947
Christophe!

170
00:23:51.924 --> 00:23:55.293
Well, this is ridiculous.
Let's get outta here. A goat...


171
00:24:02.143 --> 00:24:03.721
Oh, shit.

172
00:24:03.853 --> 00:24:05.893
Are you OK?

173
00:24:09.108 --> 00:24:12.227
- They were just graverobbers.
- Graverobbers, huh?


174
00:24:12.361 --> 00:24:15.943
- That makes me feel a lot better.
- You should have seen your face.


175
00:24:16.073 --> 00:24:18.445
You think this is funny?

176
00:24:18.575 --> 00:24:21.826
Hey, let's stop
jacking around, huh?


177
00:24:21.955 --> 00:24:24.872
We won't find Christophe tonight -
if he's even alive.


178
00:24:24.999 --> 00:24:27.537
What do you mean "if"?
You saw the photographs.


179
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:30.207
For all I know,
they were taken before he died.


180
00:24:30.338 --> 00:24:32.295
What are you trying to say?

181
00:24:32.423 --> 00:24:35.674
OK, you're my only contact
here in Haiti, right?


182
00:24:35.802 --> 00:24:40.713
First you let the evidence go, then
we spend a lotta time getting nowhere.


183
00:24:40.848 --> 00:24:44.099
Do you think I'm doin' this for
my health? I think this is a scam.


184
00:24:44.227 --> 00:24:47.811
I'm not blaming you. I've seen
the clinic. I know you need funds.


185
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.605
But do you think Cassedy's corporation
will shell out money for nothing?


186
00:24:51.735 --> 00:24:54.736
- You think this is about money?
- Yeah.


187
00:24:54.863 --> 00:24:59.360
The way Schoonbacher spoke of you, it
was as though you could walk on water.


188
00:24:59.493 --> 00:25:02.577
Now I know why. Shit floats.

189
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.701
<i>Yeah, well, why the hell
are you getting involved?</i>


190
00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:09.039
- Will you talk to me?
- Christophe!


191
00:25:19.013 --> 00:25:23.093
Christophe, it's me. Dr Duchamp.

192
00:25:24.768 --> 00:25:27.259
You remember me, don't you?

193
00:25:29.189 --> 00:25:31.229
I remember.

194
00:25:32.443 --> 00:25:34.850
This is Dr Alan.

195
00:25:34.987 --> 00:25:37.396
He's here to ask you
some questions.


196
00:25:37.991 --> 00:25:40.030
Christophe.

197
00:25:40.827 --> 00:25:45.454
I need you to remember
what happened before... you died.


198
00:25:48.293 --> 00:25:50.998
You spoke about it once to me.

199
00:25:51.129 --> 00:25:53.750
I remember... it all.

200
00:25:53.882 --> 00:25:57.416
The coffin, the... the burial.

201
00:25:59.762 --> 00:26:01.340
I... I saw it all.

202
00:26:02.682 --> 00:26:04.805
Were you sick?

203
00:26:04.935 --> 00:26:07.260
What was it that you felt?
The symptoms.


204
00:26:07.395 --> 00:26:10.729
I heard the dirt falling,
falling over me.


205
00:26:12.651 --> 00:26:15.058
The darkness pressed me down.

206
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:25.315
He says the bokor,

207
00:26:25.316 --> 00:26:29.430
the one that made him like this,
beats him with a whip.


208
00:26:29.877 --> 00:26:32.712
<i>The bokor took his soul
and sealed it away.</i>


209
00:26:32.838 --> 00:26:35.590
He makes me do evil things.

210
00:26:36.842 --> 00:26:41.754
I'm no longer free.
He sends me into people's dreams.


211
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.635
I'll need to... run a blood test
and I'd like to get a thumb print.


212
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:52.266
- No, I cannot take him to the clinic.
- This is my place. Not with the living.


213
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.558
He will find me.

214
00:26:54.694 --> 00:26:57.564
No, Christophe, you're not dead.

215
00:26:58.114 --> 00:27:01.649
Whatever they did to you, they did it
to trick you into thinking that.


216
00:27:01.784 --> 00:27:05.034
You have a good memory.
Tell us what you remember...


217
00:27:05.162 --> 00:27:08.329
<i>so we can stop the bokors
from doing this to anybody else.</i>


218
00:27:08.457 --> 00:27:10.913
Help us, Christophe.

219
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.209
It's a powder.

220
00:27:16.216 --> 00:27:17.592
A poison.

221
00:27:18.176 --> 00:27:21.343
It run through the skin...

222
00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:25.555
to the soul.

223
00:27:36.653 --> 00:27:38.693
Christophe...

224
00:27:44.494 --> 00:27:46.534
Through the skin.

225
00:27:47.706 --> 00:27:49.746
A powder.

226
00:28:20.823 --> 00:28:22.650
<i>Hé, blanc.</i>

227
00:29:15.004 --> 00:29:19.666
Lucien. We need to ask for your help
one more time. We found Christophe.


228
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.384
- He told us about the poison...
- Not another word.


229
00:29:24.306 --> 00:29:26.796
Let's go inside.

230
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:29.934
If you blunder into this,
my people get hurt.


231
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.765
The world should know
what is happening here.


232
00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:35.388
You see? She is an idealist.

233
00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:39.736
She simply does not understand how
dangerous these times have become.


234
00:29:39.862 --> 00:29:44.488
What I'm after is gonna save too
many lives. I'm not gonna back off.


235
00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:48.071
I know you know the man
that makes the powder.


236
00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:54.369
One name. Just one.

237
00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:11.186
The one in the hat
is our man, I think.


238
00:30:14.273 --> 00:30:17.393
- Louis Mozart?
- This is important?


239
00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:21.523
My friend represents powerful
interests, rich American interests.


240
00:30:21.655 --> 00:30:24.572
- American?
- That's right.


241
00:30:24.699 --> 00:30:28.318
They have an enemy they would like
to turn into a zombie.


242
00:30:28.453 --> 00:30:30.611
A zombie, huh?

243
00:30:30.747 --> 00:30:33.155
- That is all?
- That's all.


244
00:30:34.793 --> 00:30:36.833
$100.

245
00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:46.130
You've come to the right place.
Your enemy is as good as dead.


246
00:30:46.264 --> 00:30:50.760
I will catch his soul like a spider
catches a fly in his web...


247
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.349
<i>and pop it in a canari...</i>

248
00:30:55.106 --> 00:30:56.304
like this one.

249
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.691
You keep the zombie's
soul sealed up.


250
00:30:59.819 --> 00:31:02.690
It makes the flesh your slave.

251
00:31:03.657 --> 00:31:07.785
It gives you power.
You send it into people's dreams.


252
00:31:09.746 --> 00:31:11.703
Whose soul is that?

253
00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:15.658
This place's previous owner.

254
00:31:18.713 --> 00:31:20.789
Is that right?

255
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.589
$100.

256
00:31:25.261 --> 00:31:28.298
<i>I cast a spell,
the coup l'aire, tonight.</i>


257
00:31:29.433 --> 00:31:31.971
It's not the spell that I want.

258
00:31:32.102 --> 00:31:34.723
What I'm after is the powder.

259
00:31:35.355 --> 00:31:37.644
The powder.

260
00:31:39.067 --> 00:31:42.899
Some say there is such a thing.
Some say it.


261
00:31:46.742 --> 00:31:50.158
I guess Celine was wrong. This guy
can't help us out. I'm sorry.


262
00:31:50.287 --> 00:31:53.871
Celine? Lucien Celine?

263
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.368
Well, of course, of course.

264
00:31:58.504 --> 00:32:02.419
Lucien and me, we are like that.

265
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.088
A man should help his friends.

266
00:32:06.887 --> 00:32:09.259
$1,000.

267
00:32:10.724 --> 00:32:12.681
$700.

268
00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:14.849
$400, tops.

269
00:32:16.814 --> 00:32:19.270
For Celine...

270
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.274
$500.

271
00:32:22.111 --> 00:32:24.899
All right. Let's see what you got.

272
00:32:27.617 --> 00:32:30.108
I have some powder
already prepared.


273
00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.177
<i>You like it, blanc, huh?
It is beautiful.</i>


274
00:32:47.304 --> 00:32:50.139
Come in.

275
00:32:51.058 --> 00:32:55.352
With this powder,
you must be very careful.


276
00:32:55.479 --> 00:32:59.974
I make it so there
is no second chance.


277
00:33:03.486 --> 00:33:06.024
$500, huh?

278
00:33:06.949 --> 00:33:09.321
How do we know it works?

279
00:33:09.451 --> 00:33:11.942
- You want proof?
- Yeah.


280
00:33:14.123 --> 00:33:17.741
Marie!

281
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.632
Don't worry. You have enough
for ten zombies, huh?


282
00:33:38.356 --> 00:33:40.728
Yes.

283
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:58.957
You are very beautiful.

284
00:33:59.085 --> 00:34:01.541
Are you looking for work?

285
00:34:02.964 --> 00:34:07.543
He may keep you better,
but I will love you longer.


286
00:34:09.512 --> 00:34:14.388
<i>So you see, blanc?
No second chance. So, the money?</i>


287
00:34:14.976 --> 00:34:16.518
The money?

288
00:34:16.645 --> 00:34:21.022
That you get tomorrow, when I see
you raise the goat from the dead.


289
00:34:21.609 --> 00:34:26.187
I wanna see the goat alive again.
Zombies, remember?


290
00:34:28.783 --> 00:34:33.528
<i>It's too dangerous to wait at the hotel,
so we lose ourselves in the pilgrimage.</i>


291
00:34:33.663 --> 00:34:35.786
<i>And though I came for the powder...</i>

292
00:34:35.915 --> 00:34:38.750
<i>I'm getting into
something much, much more.</i>


293
00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:44.036
You know, I still have a hard time
putting you and all that stuff together.


294
00:34:44.172 --> 00:34:48.301
<i>I was brought up in the faith.
My father was a houngan.</i>


295
00:34:48.427 --> 00:34:51.049
I was dedicated to Erzulie at four.

296
00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.632
First ridden - possessed,
if you will - at eight.


297
00:34:55.518 --> 00:35:00.856
- There is beauty and compassion in it.
- Oh, yeah, I can understand that.


298
00:35:00.982 --> 00:35:04.267
- But you're a psychiatrist first.
- There is no conflict...


299
00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:06.644
between my science and my faith.

300
00:35:06.779 --> 00:35:09.733
You can give it whatever words
you will, but in Haiti...


301
00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:12.115
our God is not
just in His heaven.


302
00:35:12.244 --> 00:35:15.529
He's in our bodies, our flesh.

303
00:35:17.874 --> 00:35:20.828
There's something you should see.

304
00:35:29.636 --> 00:35:32.803
What is this ceremony?
Voodoo or Catholic?


305
00:35:33.056 --> 00:35:37.849
Haiti is 85% Catholic,
but 110% voodoo.


306
00:35:38.186 --> 00:35:42.136
For us, Erzulie and the
Virgin Mary are the same.


307
00:38:29.861 --> 00:38:31.902
<i>Blanc.</i>

308
00:38:42.708 --> 00:38:45.034
<i>Blanc.</i>

309
00:38:45.753 --> 00:38:47.959
<i>Blanc.</i>

310
00:39:49.652 --> 00:39:51.692
Are you all right, Dennis?

311
00:39:53.072 --> 00:39:57.021
Yeah. It was just a dream.
I had a bad dream.


312
00:40:25.355 --> 00:40:28.605
<i>She tells me this is one of
the cathedrals of Haiti.</i>


313
00:40:28.816 --> 00:40:32.351
<i>A place not only of great beauty,
but of great spirit as well.</i>


314
00:40:34.072 --> 00:40:36.315
<i>And maybe the place is magic.</i>

315
00:40:37.826 --> 00:40:40.234
These waters are healing.

316
00:42:36.947 --> 00:42:40.113
<i>WWBC in Miami reporting.
The word is official now.</i>


317
00:42:40.242 --> 00:42:42.568
<i>Responding to months
of demonstrations...</i>


318
00:42:42.703 --> 00:42:47.246
<i>the Duvalier government in
Haiti has declared martial law.</i>


319
00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:51.455
<i>Police and military units have imposed a
strict curfew from sundown to sunup...</i>


320
00:42:51.587 --> 00:42:55.834
<i>It was crazy. One minute
to be in such beauty and peace...</i>


321
00:42:55.967 --> 00:42:59.881
<i>the next surrounded by secret
police, the Tontons Macoutes.</i>


322
00:43:00.012 --> 00:43:02.420
<i>Strangest of all,
in the middle of all this...</i>


323
00:43:02.556 --> 00:43:06.176
<i>I couldn't get my mind
off the zombie, Christophe.</i>


324
00:43:06.311 --> 00:43:08.802
<i>Why would they do
such a thing to him?</i>


325
00:43:08.939 --> 00:43:11.608
<i>Why would they make
anybody a zombie?</i>


326
00:43:12.234 --> 00:43:15.437
Christophe was more than a patient
to you. You knew him before.


327
00:43:15.571 --> 00:43:20.529
No, but I knew of him. He was just a
grade-school teacher. No one important.


328
00:43:20.659 --> 00:43:23.364
But he wasn't afraid
to speak out for freedom.


329
00:43:23.662 --> 00:43:27.030
He was very much admired.
That's why they made him what he is.


330
00:43:27.164 --> 00:43:31.079
Instead of inspiring courage,
now he only inspires fear.


331
00:43:31.753 --> 00:43:34.505
Doctor Alan. Come with me, please.

332
00:43:37.426 --> 00:43:42.004
- Doctor Alan, come with me now.
- All right, just take it easy.


333
00:43:42.598 --> 00:43:44.886
I'll be all right.

334
00:44:24.057 --> 00:44:25.966
Ah, Dr Alan.

335
00:44:26.142 --> 00:44:29.096
- That's right.
- Why are you in Haiti, Dr Alan?


336
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:33.813
Like it says there on the passport,
I'm a tourist. I came to see the sights.


337
00:44:34.359 --> 00:44:38.107
Yes, happy, happy,
happy island people.


338
00:44:38.238 --> 00:44:40.444
Then why visit an insane asylum?

339
00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:43.738
I'm an anthropologist.

340
00:44:43.868 --> 00:44:46.158
It's a tax write-off.

341
00:44:46.288 --> 00:44:49.159
I hope you're not with the IRS.

342
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:54.833
Did you know this woman,
Marielle Duchamp, is a radical?


343
00:44:55.631 --> 00:44:57.707
So was her father.

344
00:44:57.841 --> 00:45:00.842
He was... misplaced.

345
00:45:01.595 --> 00:45:04.845
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.


346
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:09.845
So is this man...
Christophe Durand.


347
00:45:16.777 --> 00:45:19.861
- Christophe who?
- The man you met in the graveyard.


348
00:45:21.365 --> 00:45:23.523
Graveyard?

349
00:45:23.659 --> 00:45:26.909
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.


350
00:45:27.204 --> 00:45:30.241
You're not a very
good liar, Dr Alan.


351
00:45:31.417 --> 00:45:33.456
Look, I'm a tourist.

352
00:45:34.003 --> 00:45:36.673
I haven't done anything wrong.

353
00:45:36.798 --> 00:45:39.123
Do you mind if I go now?

354
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.055
This country lives on
the edge, Dr Alan.


355
00:45:54.482 --> 00:45:59.441
One weakness in the wrong place and
over it goes, back into slavery again...


356
00:45:59.571 --> 00:46:01.814
just like with the French.
- I'm not...


357
00:46:01.949 --> 00:46:07.025
The United States would like
anarchy here, I'm sure.


358
00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:11.113
Well, this isn't Grenada, Dr Alan.

359
00:46:11.249 --> 00:46:13.456
I'm here now.

360
00:46:14.044 --> 00:46:18.789
There are people like me who'd
make sure that doesn't happen.


361
00:46:22.135 --> 00:46:24.507
You remember that.

362
00:46:54.628 --> 00:46:58.790
You don't have to prove anything. It
wasn't a note slipped under the door.


363
00:46:58.923 --> 00:47:01.924
- We'd better wait another day.
- We haven't got another day.


364
00:47:02.051 --> 00:47:03.842
If we're outta the city, we're OK.

365
00:47:11.269 --> 00:47:13.973
Come, come, come, come. Come.

366
00:47:14.105 --> 00:47:18.518
We are celebrating my success!
This good fortune, huh?


367
00:47:20.654 --> 00:47:24.319
- So, how's the goat?
- Oh, business before pleasure, huh?


368
00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:26.489
The American way, no?

369
00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:32.282
You saw it die yourself,
but it walks.


370
00:47:41.968 --> 00:47:43.961
Nice animal.

371
00:47:44.095 --> 00:47:46.633
You like him?
I throw him in, no charge, huh?


372
00:47:50.017 --> 00:47:52.056
Americans.

373
00:47:55.814 --> 00:47:58.519
The money for the powder,
as we agreed.


374
00:48:10.455 --> 00:48:13.990
You see? Even in America,
they know me.


375
00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:16.201
They come for my work.

376
00:48:19.005 --> 00:48:22.006
You're an idiot.

377
00:48:28.348 --> 00:48:32.429
<i>My powders work. Maybe
I cast a spell on you.</i>


378
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:39.231
You wanna know what
I think of your powders?


379
00:48:50.161 --> 00:48:53.197
<i>Careful, blanc. 
No second chance.</i>

380
00:48:53.665 --> 00:48:55.704
Dennis!

381
00:49:04.301 --> 00:49:06.341
It's piss.

382
00:49:08.389 --> 00:49:10.844
You're a dead man.

383
00:49:19.275 --> 00:49:23.404
Dennis, just what do you think
you were doing in there?


384
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:28.026
We gotta stall him for a little time.
What do you know about radiator caps?


385
00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:30.995
What is it? Some macho death wish?

386
00:49:31.913 --> 00:49:34.071
My God,
what if it had been poison?


387
00:49:34.206 --> 00:49:37.824
It was. Rat poison, probably.

388
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.163
Give me your hand. 
See your palm?

389
00:49:42.298 --> 00:49:45.382
See the coin? And...

390
00:49:46.219 --> 00:49:48.793
poof! Oh!

391
00:49:50.682 --> 00:49:52.888
See the poison he really gave me?

392
00:49:53.226 --> 00:49:55.302
Tricks of the trade.

393
00:49:55.437 --> 00:49:57.560
Here he comes.

394
00:49:57.689 --> 00:49:59.728
Wait in the car.

395
00:50:04.613 --> 00:50:06.985
You are still alive.

396
00:50:07.115 --> 00:50:09.155
Yeah, I noticed.

397
00:50:10.785 --> 00:50:14.369
I can make you it.
The powder you want.


398
00:50:14.498 --> 00:50:20.085
<i>No tricks this time, blanc. $1,000.
The zombie poison. The coup poudre.</i>


399
00:50:20.212 --> 00:50:23.664
- All right.
- But there are rules.


400
00:50:23.799 --> 00:50:26.254
You must make it with me.

401
00:50:27.802 --> 00:50:30.128
There is no other way.

402
00:50:46.405 --> 00:50:49.157
A strong work. Fresh bones.
Quickly.


403
00:50:51.369 --> 00:50:53.408
We work here.

404
00:50:56.666 --> 00:50:58.658
You start.

405
00:50:58.793 --> 00:51:02.163
Don't worry, they never
bury them deep here.


406
00:51:02.297 --> 00:51:05.084
That is why I use this place.

407
00:51:08.303 --> 00:51:12.882
- This isn't a kid, is it?
- No, no, this is not a child.


408
00:51:14.059 --> 00:51:16.099
No, no, no.

409
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.435
A real prize, this one.

410
00:51:28.115 --> 00:51:30.154
A sorceress.

411
00:51:31.201 --> 00:51:33.739
When she lived,
she had great power.


412
00:51:35.622 --> 00:51:39.122
Now... she is just
easier to carry.


413
00:51:50.304 --> 00:51:52.344
Dennis?

414
00:51:55.893 --> 00:51:58.811
- It stinks.
- We will start tomorrow night.


415
00:51:58.938 --> 00:52:01.773
- Now, we get out of here.
- Let's go.


416
00:52:11.825 --> 00:52:14.779
I think I still have
some of my father's old shirts.


417
00:52:14.912 --> 00:52:17.748
- Maybe one will fit you.
- This shirt's fine.


418
00:52:17.874 --> 00:52:19.913
No, it isn't.

419
00:52:22.086 --> 00:52:24.791
Oh! No! No!

420
00:52:28.217 --> 00:52:30.340
Get in the jeep.

421
00:52:31.137 --> 00:52:33.295
Dennis!

422
00:53:04.128 --> 00:53:06.502
You've got a pretty face.

423
00:53:09.385 --> 00:53:11.923
The girls must like it.

424
00:53:12.054 --> 00:53:14.094
Do you like it?

425
00:53:16.934 --> 00:53:19.851
Your pretty white face?

426
00:53:20.688 --> 00:53:23.558
I asked you a question.

427
00:53:26.026 --> 00:53:29.063
Yeah... I like it.

428
00:53:31.658 --> 00:53:33.651
I like it too.

429
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:48.086
I leave the face.

430
00:53:54.806 --> 00:53:56.846
You made your point.

431
00:53:58.518 --> 00:54:00.926
I'm on the next plane. I swear.

432
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.147
It's not good enough now.
It's too late.


433
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:08.190
You were warned.

434
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:10.860
I warned you.

435
00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:15.485
I'm a US citizen.
Think about that.


436
00:54:15.869 --> 00:54:19.202
I don't see the ambassador here.
Do you?


437
00:54:22.168 --> 00:54:24.540
I'm in medical research.

438
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:28.288
There's a lot of money in it.
There's plenty for you.


439
00:54:28.424 --> 00:54:30.464
I don't want money.

440
00:54:31.093 --> 00:54:33.335
Yeah? What do you want?

441
00:54:34.096 --> 00:54:36.967
I wanna hear you scream.

442
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:47.063
Oh, no. OK.

443
00:54:47.319 --> 00:54:49.856
OK, OK.

444
00:54:50.905 --> 00:54:53.360
You wanna hear me scream?
I'll scream.


445
00:54:59.538 --> 00:55:01.578
Again.

446
00:55:05.002 --> 00:55:07.328
Not good enough.

447
00:55:27.776 --> 00:55:29.816
Dennis!

448
00:55:51.425 --> 00:55:54.628
<i>For three days, Marielle has
been my guardian angel...</i>


449
00:55:54.761 --> 00:55:57.762
<i>hiding me, nursing
me back to health.</i>


450
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.973
<i>The wound Peytraud inflicted was
struck for fear, not injury.</i>


451
00:56:02.103 --> 00:56:04.511
<i>I'm alive, intact.</i>

452
00:56:05.398 --> 00:56:09.230
<i>She told me this morning that she
wants me to go before they kill me.</i>


453
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.400
<i>But I can't do that.</i>

454
00:56:11.988 --> 00:56:13.862
Agh!

455
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:17.157
You shouldn't be out here.
You shouldn't even be walking.


456
00:56:17.285 --> 00:56:22.706
Hey, this recipe took a thousand years
to get right. I wanna learn it.


457
00:56:24.334 --> 00:56:26.374
- Oh.
- Rest.


458
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:32.459
He just went through the scrotum, right?
A little pain, a little terror.


459
00:56:35.595 --> 00:56:37.634
He scared me, OK?

460
00:56:43.978 --> 00:56:46.896
<i>The ingredients of the powder
are terrifically varied.</i>


461
00:56:47.023 --> 00:56:49.775
<i>There is the poisonous sea
toad, Bufo marinus...</i>


462
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:52.475
<i>the same animal
Lucrezia Borgia used...</i>


463
00:56:52.613 --> 00:56:56.611
<i>made even more toxic by frightening
it with a stinging sea worm.</i>


464
00:56:56.742 --> 00:57:01.155
<i>And the puffer fish, which produces one
of nature's most powerful poisons...</i>


465
00:57:01.288 --> 00:57:03.032
<i>tetrodotoxin.</i>

466
00:57:03.165 --> 00:57:06.083
<i>Plus a whole pharmacy
of herbs, minerals...</i>


467
00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:10.457
<i>charred, then ground and mixed
with a skill that's astonishing.</i>


468
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:15.465
<i>All this is woven together with a net
of magic beyond anything we know.</i>


469
00:57:28.107 --> 00:57:30.432
<i>The process will take
three days and nights.</i>


470
00:57:30.567 --> 00:57:34.102
<i>Already there is no doubt in my
mind that for all his joking...</i>


471
00:57:34.238 --> 00:57:37.986
<i>Mozart could give any Harvard
PhD a run for his money.</i>


472
00:57:42.038 --> 00:57:46.202
You cannot eat the powder
in food. That would kill completely.


473
00:57:46.334 --> 00:57:49.086
The flesh would never
rise to serve you.


474
00:58:07.523 --> 00:58:11.224
Squeeze. The bones
are brittle. It will come.


475
00:58:15.573 --> 00:58:18.822
This is the last. 
Soon, it is done.

476
00:58:20.285 --> 00:58:22.574
A good work.

477
00:58:26.708 --> 00:58:29.875
<i>It is a very frightening
thing, blanc.</i>


478
00:58:30.003 --> 00:58:32.839
The first time,
you can't tell good from bad.


479
00:58:33.174 --> 00:58:39.010
Then, after a while, it is
the very thing that sets you free.


480
00:58:43.517 --> 00:58:46.886
It must be buried with her
for one more day.


481
00:58:53.027 --> 00:58:58.319
<i>You want this enemy of yours pretty
badly, to go through such pains, blanc.</i>


482
00:58:58.909 --> 00:59:00.700
I'm all right.

483
00:59:00.827 --> 00:59:03.745
- Did he take your woman or money?
- No.


484
00:59:03.872 --> 00:59:07.917
Then why would you stand up
to a crazy man like Peytraud?


485
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:11.746
Oh, yes. I hear these things.

486
00:59:16.676 --> 00:59:19.249
The poison's not for him.

487
00:59:19.387 --> 00:59:21.427
The poison's for nobody.

488
00:59:23.267 --> 00:59:28.427
I wanna use the poison for good,
to... help people who are sick.


489
00:59:33.527 --> 00:59:36.611
My poison can be used
in such a way, huh?


490
00:59:38.615 --> 00:59:40.940
Yeah, I think so.

491
00:59:41.076 --> 00:59:43.745
I think it can be known
all over the world.


492
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:48.664
You will tell them about me? You will
tell them the name of Louis Mozart...


493
00:59:48.793 --> 00:59:52.079
and they will know
my work all over the world, huh?


494
00:59:53.965 --> 00:59:58.591
<i>All right, blanc. Come back in 24 hours
and you will have your powder.</i>


495
01:00:03.057 --> 01:00:06.840
<i>24 hours usually doesn't
seem like such a long time.</i>


496
01:00:06.977 --> 01:00:10.725
<i>In more relaxed times,
I've felt a day go by like an hour.</i>


497
01:00:10.856 --> 01:00:13.063
<i>But, as sweet as Marielle was...</i>

498
01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:16.692
<i>the day and night at the
beach house lasted a lifetime.</i>


499
01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:02.987
Dennis.

500
01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:05.076
Get outta here!

501
01:01:34.776 --> 01:01:36.816
<i>Dr Alan?</i>

502
01:01:44.077 --> 01:01:46.117
No!

503
01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:52.158
No!

504
01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:07.513
Agh!

505
01:02:28.581 --> 01:02:31.416
Marielle. Marielle.

506
01:02:31.542 --> 01:02:34.377
We gotta get outta here.

507
01:02:58.861 --> 01:03:02.312
Not this time, Doctor,
we're beyond that now.


508
01:03:20.008 --> 01:03:25.216
<i>These canari hold the souls of those who
were masters in the realm of the spirits.</i>


509
01:03:25.722 --> 01:03:28.094
Now their spirits serve me.

510
01:03:30.644 --> 01:03:33.894
She knows I'm telling the truth,
that such things are possible.


511
01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:37.023
I know the price you will pay
for what you have done.


512
01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:40.686
The photographs we took today
are quite convincing.


513
01:03:40.988 --> 01:03:45.448
If you return, you'll be tried for
the murder of Christophe's sister.


514
01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:50.036
The courts will take your life, but
that will be only the beginning.


515
01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:53.786
After you're dead...

516
01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.826
I'll take your soul.

517
01:03:59.424 --> 01:04:02.128
What'll happen to Marielle?

518
01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.214
You go home.

519
01:04:05.388 --> 01:04:08.839
She's home. She's Haitian.

520
01:04:09.142 --> 01:04:12.178
I have no reason to hurt her
once you're gone.


521
01:04:12.895 --> 01:04:16.146
Just... leave, Dennis.

522
01:04:17.358 --> 01:04:19.814
It is the only way.

523
01:04:24.658 --> 01:04:28.702
By the way, Dr Alan, what did you
dream about this afternoon?


524
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:33.285
The woman in your arms?
The sea at your doorstep?


525
01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:35.788
No.

526
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:41.371
You dreamt of me and of the grave.
I know because I was there.


527
01:04:41.841 --> 01:04:44.877
And I can be there
every time you close your eyes.


528
01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:48.096
The pain I caused you
in the room upstairs...


529
01:04:48.265 --> 01:04:52.642
is nothing to the pain
I can cause in your own mind.


530
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.356
Remember that, Dr Alan.

531
01:05:46.157 --> 01:05:48.827
You promised me $1,000.

532
01:05:49.953 --> 01:05:52.989
Did you forget your promise?

533
01:05:59.296 --> 01:06:01.373
No, I haven't got it.

534
01:06:01.507 --> 01:06:03.547
They took all my money.

535
01:06:04.302 --> 01:06:06.341
Well...

536
01:06:11.016 --> 01:06:13.341
take it anyway.

537
01:06:13.476 --> 01:06:16.228
<i>But you will tell
them about me, blanc.</i>


538
01:06:16.938 --> 01:06:19.512
You will make them know my name.

539
01:06:20.692 --> 01:06:22.898
I will.

540
01:06:23.361 --> 01:06:26.529
I'll let 'em know
you're a man to be trusted.


541
01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:34.991
On account, huh?

542
01:06:36.167 --> 01:06:38.206
Fair enough.

543
01:07:04.779 --> 01:07:07.614
- You used baboon?
- I put the powder in the palms.


544
01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.694
It went into the blood.

545
01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:13.115
Or at least, they looked dead.

546
01:07:13.245 --> 01:07:15.487
My God, are these
numbers accurate?


547
01:07:15.623 --> 01:07:17.451
- Oh, yeah.
- The shift seems radical.


548
01:07:17.584 --> 01:07:22.958
It's triple-checked. These are
typical brain scans from our subjects.


549
01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:26.624
It's very focused. It targets
only certain areas of the brain.


550
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.627
Air and vital functions:
Breathing, heart rate.


551
01:07:30.764 --> 01:07:33.385
Looks like somebody
turned it off with a switch.


552
01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:38.594
But in the areas controlling sensory
awareness, thoughts and emotions...


553
01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:41.349
bang.

554
01:07:41.484 --> 01:07:43.940
So the animals know
what's happening to them?


555
01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:47.653
Yeah, the entire time.
A man would, too.


556
01:07:47.782 --> 01:07:52.658
You'd hear, see,
maybe even feel, think.


557
01:07:52.787 --> 01:07:56.736
But you couldn't do anything about it.
You'd just lie there, lookin'...


558
01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:59.827
Dead... and be buried.

559
01:08:01.253 --> 01:08:03.292
But you'd be alive.

560
01:08:04.089 --> 01:08:08.503
<i>And, I reminded myself,
the tests revealed the powder wore off...</i>


561
01:08:08.636 --> 01:08:13.132
<i>after 12 hours or so, leaving the
victim completely normal again.</i>


562
01:08:13.266 --> 01:08:16.433
<i>Except by then he'd be six feet
under in the airless black...</i>


563
01:08:16.561 --> 01:08:19.846
<i>clawing and screaming, with
no one to hear his suffocation.</i>


564
01:08:19.981 --> 01:08:22.020
Thanks.

565
01:08:24.193 --> 01:08:27.278
It's incredible
how rumor’s spreading.


566
01:08:27.405 --> 01:08:31.023
It's unbelievable. The company stock
closed up a point and a half today.


567
01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:34.155
All based on rumor about
what Dennis brought back.


568
01:08:34.288 --> 01:08:37.242
- Thank you, darling.
- I'm just glad you got out all right.


569
01:08:37.374 --> 01:08:40.292
The news says
the whole country is in turmoil.


570
01:08:41.086 --> 01:08:42.996
Yeah, I guess it is.

571
01:08:43.464 --> 01:08:45.789
We're kickin' around
a name for the product.


572
01:08:45.925 --> 01:08:50.585
I can't believe I employ people who
wanna call an anesthetic "Zombanol".


573
01:08:51.471 --> 01:08:53.013
I mean...

574
01:08:53.139 --> 01:08:55.547
It's... really good.

575
01:08:57.311 --> 01:08:59.932
I gotta get some air. I'm sorry.

576
01:09:00.481 --> 01:09:02.853
Excuse me for a moment.

577
01:09:04.735 --> 01:09:06.775
I'm sorry.

578
01:09:08.864 --> 01:09:10.904
We need to talk.

579
01:09:13.243 --> 01:09:16.161
Something's wrong. 
I can feel it.

580
01:09:16.288 --> 01:09:19.242
I've been trying to call
for three days. There's no answer.


581
01:09:19.375 --> 01:09:22.709
- She could be away.
- Yeah. She could be in trouble, too.


582
01:09:22.837 --> 01:09:25.755
- I gotta go back there.
- Listen to me.


583
01:09:27.259 --> 01:09:30.841
There's a door to the mystical,
and you've just walked through it.


584
01:09:30.971 --> 01:09:35.716
Right now, you are very vulnerable.
I wouldn't go back to Haiti now.


585
01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:39.931
You'd be a grade-school boy
in a world of Nobel Prize winners.


586
01:09:40.063 --> 01:09:43.182
I'd stay as far away
from Haiti as I could.


587
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:07.499
What you have done is a major
breakthrough. It's quite mind-boggling.


588
01:10:08.466 --> 01:10:12.845
The only thing I don't understand
is how did Christophe Durand survive?


589
01:10:12.972 --> 01:10:15.048
How was he able to speak?

590
01:10:16.017 --> 01:10:17.475
Alex?

591
01:10:17.602 --> 01:10:22.678
Well, as far as we can tell,
somehow, I don't know how...


592
01:10:22.815 --> 01:10:27.062
someone dug him outta the grave
so no brain damage occurred.


593
01:10:39.165 --> 01:10:42.166
Is something wrong with your soup?

594
01:10:44.837 --> 01:10:47.921
No. No, it's all right, I...

595
01:10:49.508 --> 01:10:51.834
I'm not hungry.
- Albert?


596
01:10:52.386 --> 01:10:54.794
Dr Alan is finished with his soup.

597
01:10:56.724 --> 01:10:59.096
Perhaps monsieur would like
some salad instead?


598
01:10:59.226 --> 01:11:01.635
No, I, uh...

599
01:11:01.772 --> 01:11:04.689
I've been having
some stomach problems.


600
01:11:04.816 --> 01:11:09.194
Occupational hazard -
dysentery, botfly, malaria.


601
01:11:11.406 --> 01:11:13.814
A toast? A toast?

602
01:11:15.202 --> 01:11:17.111
To Dennis...

603
01:11:17.245 --> 01:11:20.946
to his adventures,
and to this marvelous discovery.


604
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:26.623
He rang to a... a new...

605
01:11:27.339 --> 01:11:30.256
to a new...
- Debra? Sit down, Debra.


606
01:11:47.567 --> 01:11:52.943
<i>You're going to die.
You've been warned. You're going to die.</i>


607
01:11:53.825 --> 01:11:57.988
Debra, Debra.

608
01:12:29.485 --> 01:12:33.269
<i>He's gonna get to me,
wherever I am. I know that now.</i>


609
01:12:33.406 --> 01:12:36.075
<i>I've stolen his darkest and
most powerful secret.</i>


610
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.530
<i>He'll want to get even and if he can't
get me, he'll go for Marielle.</i>


611
01:12:43.751 --> 01:12:46.076
Hey, I'm a US citizen!

612
01:12:46.253 --> 01:12:48.293
I'm a US citizen! Somebody!

613
01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:56.293
Hey, somebody!

614
01:12:59.934 --> 01:13:01.973
Lucien.

615
01:13:02.728 --> 01:13:06.347
<i>Lucien snatched me from under the
nose of the Tontons Macoutes.</i>


616
01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:13.568
<i>Marielle was safe. She was guarded
by his men at her clinic, he said.</i>


617
01:13:13.906 --> 01:13:17.690
<i>But for Mozart and me,
it was a different matter.</i>


618
01:13:29.046 --> 01:13:31.668
This will give you
some protection, that's all.


619
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.169
Just like your
scientific objectivity.


620
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.092
In this country, I haven't felt
protected by anything.


621
01:13:41.226 --> 01:13:44.096
<i>You don't know what
hasn't gotten to you.</i>


622
01:13:47.274 --> 01:13:49.599
I'm not afraid for myself.

623
01:13:49.734 --> 01:13:52.404
A good thing. Up.

624
01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:08.624
Remember, when the battle comes,
it won't be fought in the streets.


625
01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:12.039
It will be fought
in your mind, in your soul.


626
01:14:14.009 --> 01:14:17.378
Marielle was right. 
This must end.

627
01:14:18.096 --> 01:14:21.846
These people,
Peytraud, Duvalier...


628
01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:25.978
They're not Haiti,
they are mad dogs.


629
01:14:26.856 --> 01:14:28.895
The madness must stop.

630
01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.444
You're makin' a mistake. The president
and me, we are like this... like this.


631
01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.915
Something's wrong, isn't it?

632
01:15:00.097 --> 01:15:03.015
We are in our spirits' hands now,
you and I.


633
01:15:04.602 --> 01:15:07.852
Remember, whatever happens...

634
01:15:08.564 --> 01:15:10.889
death is not the end.

635
01:15:12.319 --> 01:15:14.857
Lucien.

636
01:15:37.553 --> 01:15:38.752
Oh, fuck.

637
01:16:03.913 --> 01:16:06.321
Help me. Please, help me.

638
01:16:06.457 --> 01:16:08.497
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

639
01:16:55.507 --> 01:16:58.841
Don't... don't let them bury me.

640
01:16:59.595 --> 01:17:02.086
I'm not dead.

641
01:17:16.529 --> 01:17:19.530
Anything? Pressure? Pulse?

642
01:17:19.658 --> 01:17:21.697
Nothing.

643
01:17:24.996 --> 01:17:27.119
We've lost him.

644
01:17:30.251 --> 01:17:32.540
Write the time on the tag.

645
01:17:33.545 --> 01:17:38.089
- We'll notify the embassy tomorrow.
- No need for that, Doctor.


646
01:17:38.217 --> 01:17:40.922
I've made all the arrangements.

647
01:17:43.181 --> 01:17:45.221
Whatever.

648
01:17:47.018 --> 01:17:52.605
He's dead. I trust somebody on your end
will take care of the proper paperwork?


649
01:17:56.695 --> 01:18:00.277
No, no, no. No rest.

650
01:18:01.074 --> 01:18:04.490
You'll see it all. 
You'll feel it.

651
01:18:04.619 --> 01:18:07.574
The cold in the coffin...

652
01:18:07.707 --> 01:18:12.250
it is worse...
much, much worse.


653
01:18:24.348 --> 01:18:28.043
<i>Lucien Celine, the great houngan...</i>

654
01:18:28.044 --> 01:18:30.774
<i>He serves me now, too.</i>

655
01:18:31.689 --> 01:18:35.140
Lucien can't protect you.
I hold him fast!


656
01:18:35.568 --> 01:18:38.652
Lucien will turn
your blood to worms.


657
01:18:38.779 --> 01:18:41.816
<i>Oh, yeah? Do you hear me, blanc?</i>

658
01:18:42.199 --> 01:18:44.737
Her head will be taken
as an offering tonight.


659
01:18:44.869 --> 01:18:47.194
No, wait.

660
01:18:55.838 --> 01:18:58.330
To keep you company.

661
01:19:53.398 --> 01:19:57.016
When you wake up, scream,
Dr Alan. Scream all you want.


662
01:19:57.151 --> 01:19:59.607
There is no escape from the grave.

663
01:20:39.403 --> 01:20:43.021
Ohh! Oh, God.

664
01:20:59.089 --> 01:21:01.712
Here!

665
01:21:02.677 --> 01:21:05.715
Here! Here!

666
01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.259
Agh! Agh!

667
01:21:13.187 --> 01:21:14.847
Oh, God.

668
01:21:30.538 --> 01:21:32.578
You're alive.

669
01:21:33.249 --> 01:21:35.289
You're alive.

670
01:21:48.974 --> 01:21:51.181
I know it's bad, the poison.

671
01:21:51.602 --> 01:21:53.974
You see things the
living can't see.


672
01:22:20.506 --> 01:22:23.341
<i>This is WWBC in Miami reporting.</i>

673
01:22:23.509 --> 01:22:25.502
<i>We've just received
word from Haiti...</i>


674
01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:29.005
<i>that "Baby Doc" Duvalier,
his wife Michelle and his family...</i>


675
01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:31.013
<i>are en route to the airport.</i>

676
01:22:31.142 --> 01:22:33.467
<i>It's happening in the
middle of the night...</i>


677
01:22:33.602 --> 01:22:36.176
<i>and no one knows
what it means for sure.</i>


678
01:22:38.941 --> 01:22:41.480
<i>It is confirmed now the
Duvaliers are fleeing.</i>


679
01:22:41.612 --> 01:22:45.395
<i>The scene at the airport was one
of barely controlled panic.</i>


680
01:22:48.701 --> 01:22:51.536
<i>Word is that revolution is
sweeping the country...</i>


681
01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:55.494
<i>as news reaches the
smaller towns and villages.</i>


682
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.675
<i>Liberté! Liberté!</i>

683
01:23:55.936 --> 01:23:58.475
<i>- Liberté!
- Where is your power now?</i>


684
01:23:58.773 --> 01:24:01.940
<i>The loas themselves
are having their vengeance.</i>


685
01:24:02.610 --> 01:24:05.896
<i>Liberté! Liberté! Liberté!</i>

686
01:24:48.282 --> 01:24:50.773
Your soul is mine.

687
01:24:54.538 --> 01:24:59.533
Get up, Dr Alan.
I control your thoughts now.


688
01:24:59.668 --> 01:25:01.708
Get up!

689
01:25:49.135 --> 01:25:52.006
Dennis! Dennis!

690
01:25:53.098 --> 01:25:54.889
Help me.

691
01:25:56.893 --> 01:25:59.099
- Marielle.
- Help me.


692
01:25:59.688 --> 01:26:02.061
- Help me.
- Marielle.


693
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.360
Help me.

694
01:26:11.033 --> 01:26:13.073
Dennis.

695
01:26:14.328 --> 01:26:16.535
It's your fault.

696
01:26:16.831 --> 01:26:20.827
- It was your work...
- It was your work...


697
01:26:20.959 --> 01:26:26.879
that caused this.
- It was your work that caused this.


698
01:26:27.967 --> 01:26:29.675
Argh!

699
01:26:30.094 --> 01:26:31.885
Argh!

700
01:27:18.977 --> 01:27:21.302
Argh!

701
01:27:46.798 --> 01:27:48.837
Peytraud?

702
01:28:20.123 --> 01:28:22.162
Peytraud.

703
01:28:23.418 --> 01:28:25.457
Dennis?

704
01:28:46.775 --> 01:28:49.776
Argh!

705
01:28:50.863 --> 01:28:53.188
Argh!

706
01:28:55.159 --> 01:28:57.401
Peytraud.

707
01:29:01.498 --> 01:29:03.989
- No.
- Help us, Lucien, please!


708
01:29:04.126 --> 01:29:05.075
No!

709
01:30:56.741 --> 01:31:00.869
Hold on a second. I'm not gonna
leave that thing in one piece.


710
01:31:21.433 --> 01:31:23.011
No rest for you!

711
01:31:23.185 --> 01:31:26.222
<i>No rest for you, blanc!</i>

712
01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:28.395
You're coming with me!

713
01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.982
You're coming with me to hell!

714
01:31:35.155 --> 01:31:37.824
Son of a bitch!

715
01:31:39.284 --> 01:31:41.360
I'm tired of this shit.

716
01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:18.401
- What do you want?
- I wanna hear you scream.


717
01:32:25.623 --> 01:32:26.904
No!

718
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.072
Yes.

719
01:32:49.565 --> 01:32:50.976
Den?

720
01:32:51.859 --> 01:32:52.973
Are you all right?

721
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:58.780
<i>- Liberté! Liberté! Liberté!
- The nightmare is over, Den. It's over.</i>
