1
00:06:19.317 --> 00:06:21.251
Pleased to meet you.

2
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.221
Two of the horses run off, but
that pinto you're riding hung around.


3
00:06:33.298 --> 00:06:36.290
You got no idea what
they were after?


4
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.734
Offend anybody lately?

5
00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:42.932
Not for five years.

6
00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:48.170
- Jefferson City?
- No. Leavenworth.


7
00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:50.510
Never been in there.

8
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.218
They jumped you
out of the blue?


9
00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:58.087
I had to get up anyway.

10
00:07:02.894 --> 00:07:05.385
Me, I'm riding along
minding my own business.


11
00:07:05.463 --> 00:07:10.196
Four cowboys come by, and we decide
to ride together. Friendly as can be.


12
00:07:10.268 --> 00:07:14.398
I figure you should approach life like
everybody's your friend or nobody is.


13
00:07:14.472 --> 00:07:16.440
Don't make much difference.

14
00:07:16.508 --> 00:07:20.501
Suddenly everybody's
pointing their gun but me.


15
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.371
Guess they admired my horse.

16
00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.283
Looks like that's not all
they admired.


17
00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:32.084
Yep. My whole rig.

18
00:07:32.157 --> 00:07:35.126
I don't care much about the rest...

19
00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:38.560
but I surely will miss
that bay.


20
00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:43.057
At least they didn't kill me.

21
00:07:43.134 --> 00:07:47.161
That was right considerate,
I thought.


22
00:07:49.507 --> 00:07:52.305
They were laughing
when they left me.


23
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:55.741
Thought it was real funny.

24
00:07:57.115 --> 00:08:01.814
I walked for a little while,
but it was no use so I gave it up.


25
00:08:01.586 --> 00:08:04.555
Figured it was just bad luck.

26
00:08:05.657 --> 00:08:08.125
Looks like those boys
are headed south...


27
00:08:08.193 --> 00:08:10.627
so they weren't the same ones
that jumped me.


28
00:08:12.264 --> 00:08:14.824
Where are you going?

29
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.630
Where's the pinto going?

30
00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:33.440
I'll get these horses tended to.

31
00:08:42.594 --> 00:08:44.755
I'm good for it.

32
00:09:17.696 --> 00:09:20.790
Just a minute. When I'm done
helping the lady, I'll come here...


33
00:09:20.866 --> 00:09:22.925
I'll take this one.

34
00:09:24.369 --> 00:09:27.338
This one is $20.

35
00:09:34.946 --> 00:09:39.349
- How much to borrow it?
- The guns are for sale.


36
00:09:42.354 --> 00:09:44.413
What can I get for that?

37
00:10:00.205 --> 00:10:01.502
Look, Ma!

38
00:10:27.432 --> 00:10:29.627
This is the man, Sergeant.

39
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:32.261
He claims the animal was stolen.

40
00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:39.440
How do I know
this is your horse?


41
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.741
Can't you see this horse loves me?

42
00:10:41.813 --> 00:10:45.806
I had a gal do that to me.
It didn't make her my wife.


43
00:10:45.884 --> 00:10:49.012
On the underside of that saddle
I got my name scratched.


44
00:10:49.087 --> 00:10:51.180
Take a look and you'll see.

45
00:10:52.557 --> 00:10:56.220
- And what would your name be?
- Paden.


46
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:01.399
P
-A
-D
-E
-N.

47
00:11:05.537 --> 00:11:07.004
Hello, Cobb.

48
00:11:08.974 --> 00:11:10.805
Hello, Paden.

49
00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:12.843
How're you doing?

50
00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:14.811
You know this man?

51
00:11:16.348 --> 00:11:18.077
I surely do.

52
00:11:19.618 --> 00:11:22.519
Troopers, let's take a look
at this saddle.


53
00:11:29.728 --> 00:11:31.719
All right.

54
00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:34.822
Move along, folks.
Get these children out of here.


55
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.495
And you, get some clothes on.

56
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.702
I see you've been prospering
without me.


57
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.444
It's been a while.

58
00:11:47.512 --> 00:11:50.242
Where's the dog?

59
00:11:58.623 --> 00:12:00.921
Appreciate the loan.

60
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.851
I'm good for it.

61
00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:07.693
Let's talk about that.

62
00:12:07.766 --> 00:12:10.030
I'm looking for some men.

63
00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:18.673
- I've given that up.
- So have I.


64
00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:22.873
I've got a legitimate job now.
I could use a guy like you.


65
00:12:25.383 --> 00:12:27.476
You've got a legitimate job?

66
00:12:27.552 --> 00:12:29.884
Yes, sir, you wouldn't believe it.

67
00:12:29.954 --> 00:12:31.615
You're right.

68
00:12:33.358 --> 00:12:36.259
This is mighty sweet, Paden.

69
00:12:36.327 --> 00:12:40.024
I think I finally found my place
in the world.


70
00:12:40.965 --> 00:12:43.297
Well, I'm...

71
00:12:43.368 --> 00:12:45.359
real happy for you, Cobb.

72
00:12:47.138 --> 00:12:50.130
But I think I'll just
keep looking for mine.


73
00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:57.305
He's getting out.

74
00:13:02.687 --> 00:13:05.747
Come on, Paden.
This oughta interest you.


75
00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:18.058
Look who's here, Tyree.

76
00:13:24.109 --> 00:13:27.010
Our old ridin' buddy.

77
00:13:33.017 --> 00:13:36.009
I invited Paden to join us...

78
00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:38.317
but he's not having any.

79
00:13:49.367 --> 00:13:51.335
Where's the dog?

80
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.765
You owe me $13.

81
00:14:02.881 --> 00:14:05.145
Thirteen.

82
00:14:05.216 --> 00:14:07.150
Bad luck.

83
00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.454
I see what you like.

84
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.464
She's mighty pretty.

85
00:14:20.532 --> 00:14:23.126
And bridle-wise, too.

86
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:26.500
The only thing I lost
I really cared about...


87
00:14:26.571 --> 00:14:29.369
except for maybe my hat.

88
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.774
It's a great one.
Black with a pretty silver band on it.


89
00:14:33.845 --> 00:14:36.473
My head spent three years
training it.


90
00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:40.109
Sure do miss that hat.

91
00:14:40.185 --> 00:14:43.086
I got to be going.

92
00:14:43.154 --> 00:14:46.055
Going to Turley, was it?

93
00:14:46.124 --> 00:14:51.528
Yeah. I gotta stop off there,
meet a guy. Head out for Silverado.


94
00:14:54.265 --> 00:14:56.199
What's Turley like?

95
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.131
It's a town.

96
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.732
Got a saloon?

97
00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:06.640
I expect.

98
00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:09.713
Women?

99
00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:11.510
I expect.

100
00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:43.730
Baxter! Hawley!
Where the hell you been?


101
00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:47.175
You're late, and I tell you
I don't like it. It's a bad start.


102
00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:50.681
I got my people down there
throwing snowballs and rearing to go!


103
00:16:50.748 --> 00:16:55.481
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend.
My name ain't Baxter. He ain't Hawley.


104
00:16:55.553 --> 00:16:57.714
- You're not Baxter?
- Name's Emmett.


105
00:16:57.789 --> 00:17:00.189
- You're not Baxter, either?
- No. I'm not Hawley.


106
00:17:00.258 --> 00:17:02.658
Goddamn it!

107
00:17:02.727 --> 00:17:06.720
They ain't Baxter and Hawley!
Where the hell is Baxter and Hawley?


108
00:17:06.798 --> 00:17:09.358
Quit yelling, you old coot.
We're right here.


109
00:17:09.434 --> 00:17:12.096
Who you calling a coot?

110
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.571
Calm down, Mr. Hobart.
I'm Nord Baxter.


111
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.803
- There's my partner, Tom Hawley.
- You're late. It's a bad start.


112
00:17:18.876 --> 00:17:22.437
Yes. That means we'II have to get you
to Silverado that much quicker.


113
00:17:22.513 --> 00:17:24.504
All right. Let's get goin'!

114
00:17:24.582 --> 00:17:28.040
You remember my letter, don't you?
Half now and half when we get there.


115
00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.246
I remember.
Open the box.


116
00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:41.955
Thank you.

117
00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:44.524
- Don't you even want to count it?
- Not at all, friend.


118
00:17:44.602 --> 00:17:46.536
We trust you.

119
00:17:47.538 --> 00:17:49.972
Let's get this wagon train
to Silverado.


120
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:51.736
You bet!

121
00:18:29.113 --> 00:18:31.047
What do you want?

122
00:18:31.115 --> 00:18:35.245
I haven't had a whiskey
or slept in a bed in ten days.


123
00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:38.855
Give me a bottle.

124
00:18:54.939 --> 00:18:58.170
Hey, what are you doing, buck?

125
00:18:59.243 --> 00:19:01.211
Having a drink.

126
00:19:06.217 --> 00:19:08.811
No, you're not.
Get outta here.


127
00:19:11.422 --> 00:19:17.292
I haven't had a whiskey
or slept in a bed in ten days.


128
00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:20.330
You ain't gettin' it here.

129
00:19:20.398 --> 00:19:22.764
I'm real sorry to hear that.

130
00:19:25.036 --> 00:19:28.335
- Doesn't look quite fair.
- Which way do you mean?


131
00:19:54.665 --> 00:19:56.599
What's all this then?

132
00:20:00.138 --> 00:20:03.437
This nigger's breaking up my place,
Sheriff Langston.


133
00:20:03.508 --> 00:20:06.170
I don't like that word much,
Carter.


134
00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:09.077
We don't serve them here
and you know it.


135
00:20:09.147 --> 00:20:12.173
I asked him to leave
and he went crazy on us!


136
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.209
- Now he owes me money for this damage.
- Is that a fact?


137
00:20:16.287 --> 00:20:20.417
Afraid not, Sheriff.
These other fellas started the ruckus.


138
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:23.324
Are these your friends?

139
00:20:23.394 --> 00:20:25.862
I wanted a drink and a bed.

140
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.865
- Guess I came to the wrong place.
- Came to the wrong town.


141
00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:34.496
I don't tolerate this. It's hard
on the peace and the furniture.


142
00:20:34.572 --> 00:20:40.135
Knowing a bit about Carter, I'll let
you go without paying for the damage.


143
00:20:40.211 --> 00:20:43.305
But go you will,
and I mean now.


144
00:20:44.482 --> 00:20:48.248
Is there a place in town
that takes my kind?


145
00:20:48.319 --> 00:20:50.549
You misunderstand.
I want you out of town.


146
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:53.784
In fact, I want you all the way
out of my jurisdiction.


147
00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:56.893
That ain't right.

148
00:20:56.961 --> 00:21:01.830
I decide what's right
in this jurisdiction. Now move.


149
00:21:56.354 --> 00:21:58.720
Who's gonna pay for this, Sheriff?

150
00:22:00.324 --> 00:22:02.792
Don't press your luck, Carter.

151
00:22:12.136 --> 00:22:14.730
Now, let's talk about you chaps.

152
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.537
- We'd rather stay.
- We'll see about that.


153
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.602
I'm Sheriff John Langston.

154
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.080
As you may have guessed,
I am not from these parts.


155
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.711
You're kidding?

156
00:22:28.786 --> 00:22:31.812
But the good citizens of Turley
have taken me in their embrace...


157
00:22:31.889 --> 00:22:35.256
and for one simple reason:
I maintain the peace.


158
00:22:35.326 --> 00:22:39.228
So, when strangers come to town,
I always ask them their business.


159
00:22:40.531 --> 00:22:43.466
Have you come for the hanging?

160
00:22:43.534 --> 00:22:46.025
I'm just meeting a guy here
and moving on.


161
00:22:46.103 --> 00:22:48.298
So far I haven't been able
to find him.


162
00:22:48.372 --> 00:22:51.671
In my town, if you're looking
for someone, you ask me.


163
00:22:51.742 --> 00:22:55.838
All right. He's a young fella,
full of juice, about my size...


164
00:22:55.913 --> 00:22:57.881
wears a fancy two-gun rig.

165
00:23:03.888 --> 00:23:06.880
I know where that gentleman is.

166
00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.861
I want everyone to behave himself.

167
00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:16.098
Emmett?

168
00:23:18.469 --> 00:23:19.902
Howdy, Jake.

169
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.064
I'm glad to see you!

170
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.664
Keep back.

171
00:23:25.943 --> 00:23:28.002
- Thank you.
- What's going on here?


172
00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:32.106
You got me!
This is a crazy town.


173
00:23:32.183 --> 00:23:35.016
I think we ought to just
get out of here.


174
00:23:36.153 --> 00:23:38.144
All I did was kiss a girl.

175
00:23:38.222 --> 00:23:42.181
- That's why they got you in jail?
- Yeah, I kissed a girl.


176
00:23:42.259 --> 00:23:45.319
This guy didn't like it...

177
00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:48.991
so we had some words
so I decided to get outta there.


178
00:23:50.101 --> 00:23:52.763
So I did!
I got out of there.


179
00:23:52.837 --> 00:23:55.237
You know me.
I don't want no trouble.


180
00:23:55.306 --> 00:23:58.298
So I walked out into the street.

181
00:23:58.376 --> 00:24:02.176
- He tries to shoot me in the back.
- You had to kill him?


182
00:24:02.246 --> 00:24:05.147
No, I winged him
and he dropped his gun.


183
00:24:05.216 --> 00:24:07.446
You're in here for winging a guy?

184
00:24:08.953 --> 00:24:13.515
No, not exactly, because then
his friend opened up on me.


185
00:24:13.591 --> 00:24:16.116
- What friend's that?
- The one with the shotgun.


186
00:24:16.193 --> 00:24:18.252
The dead one.

187
00:24:23.134 --> 00:24:26.035
Jake. Jake!

188
00:24:26.103 --> 00:24:30.665
I'm gonna ask you once.
Was it self-defense?


189
00:24:33.477 --> 00:24:36.139
Honest to God,
he would've killed me.


190
00:24:38.883 --> 00:24:41.374
The jury saw it differently.

191
00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:46.352
- He's the guy you're gonna hang?
- Tomorrow morning at 10:00.


192
00:24:46.424 --> 00:24:48.688
I was afraid of that.

193
00:24:50.795 --> 00:24:53.320
Emmett, can't you help me?

194
00:24:53.397 --> 00:24:56.992
You know the law, Jake.
You know what they did to me.


195
00:25:00.938 --> 00:25:03.736
Blind Pete always said you'd hang.

196
00:25:06.677 --> 00:25:10.204
I guess tomorrow at dawn,
he'll be proved right.


197
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:12.306
10:00 a.m.

198
00:25:12.383 --> 00:25:15.375
Right. I always thought
they did it at dawn.


199
00:25:17.087 --> 00:25:20.318
So long, kid.
I'm sorry.


200
00:25:30.434 --> 00:25:34.200
I hate to see any man swing.
It's bad luck.


201
00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:38.469
Bad luck for me.
I gotta bust him outta there.


202
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:47.476
You'll have to deal me out
on that.


203
00:25:47.551 --> 00:25:51.817
I've had some experience
with that sort of thing.


204
00:25:51.889 --> 00:25:55.052
- I don't want any more.
- I understand.


205
00:25:58.395 --> 00:26:03.025
- It's not going to be easy.
- It never is.


206
00:26:06.036 --> 00:26:08.368
But he's my brother.

207
00:26:08.439 --> 00:26:10.407
We're going to California together...

208
00:26:10.474 --> 00:26:14.877
but first we're stopping off in
Silverado, see our sister, say good-bye.


209
00:26:16.213 --> 00:26:18.738
I can't show up there
with a story like this.


210
00:26:20.184 --> 00:26:22.652
I guess this is where
we part ways.


211
00:26:24.955 --> 00:26:29.324
- Sorry.
- No hard feelings.


212
00:26:30.961 --> 00:26:33.452
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

213
00:26:34.398 --> 00:26:37.094
You ain't got any money.

214
00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:39.567
You buy me a drink.

215
00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:45.141
You know, a good, smelly saloon...

216
00:26:45.209 --> 00:26:48.178
is my favorite place in the world.

217
00:27:36.493 --> 00:27:38.518
You're wearing my hat.

218
00:27:39.964 --> 00:27:42.626
What else you got that's mine?

219
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.294
Mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.


220
00:27:53.811 --> 00:27:57.679
I hope your fingers aren't tickling
my ivory-handled colt.


221
00:28:05.222 --> 00:28:09.215
If you stand up slow and let me see,
you might live through this night.


222
00:28:18.535 --> 00:28:20.230
Sure.

223
00:28:35.452 --> 00:28:38.683
You're making a big mistake.

224
00:28:38.756 --> 00:28:41.247
That's what I told 'em.

225
00:28:59.643 --> 00:29:03.511
You mean you ain't coming
with Emmett and me?


226
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.912
I can't say I'm convinced
you're going anywhere.


227
00:29:05.983 --> 00:29:08.713
We sure are!
We're leaving at dawn.


228
00:29:14.291 --> 00:29:16.657
I have no reason to run.

229
00:29:16.727 --> 00:29:19.890
It was a fair fight
and there were plenty of witnesses.


230
00:29:19.963 --> 00:29:22.727
Yeah, that's what happened
with me, too.


231
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.234
The other guy drew first.

232
00:29:26.236 --> 00:29:28.101
Right.

233
00:29:47.191 --> 00:29:49.386
Sheriff, open up!

234
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.296
Sheriff Langston, come quick!

235
00:29:56.567 --> 00:29:59.400
Lock the door.
Don't let anybody in.


236
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:13.575
Blind Pete used to do this
all by...


237
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.277
touch.

238
00:30:35.005 --> 00:30:37.599
All right, where is he?

239
00:30:38.776 --> 00:30:40.744
- He left.
- Like hell!


240
00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:43.336
This is the only way out.

241
00:30:45.048 --> 00:30:47.846
I woke up and he was gone.

242
00:30:52.222 --> 00:30:56.522
All right, kid, come on out.
I know you're under there.


243
00:30:58.362 --> 00:31:00.353
You, get over here.

244
00:31:01.632 --> 00:31:03.998
Yeah, you, get over here.

245
00:31:05.536 --> 00:31:07.595
Gimme your hands.

246
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.281
Did you get him?

247
00:31:32.396 --> 00:31:35.297
Thanks for giving me a hand.

248
00:32:05.729 --> 00:32:07.321
What now?

249
00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:10.198
We wait.

250
00:32:10.267 --> 00:32:11.825
Let's go.

251
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.568
Come on, Jake, let's go!

252
00:34:08.618 --> 00:34:11.109
Get 'em at the river.

253
00:35:06.843 --> 00:35:09.334
Here's a trick for you, kid.

254
00:35:17.788 --> 00:35:20.985
- That them shooting?
- No, it's coming from those rocks.


255
00:35:22.592 --> 00:35:27.529
- Let's go. He ain't hitting nothing.
- He's hit everything he's aimed at.


256
00:35:27.597 --> 00:35:30.498
They won't be out of our jurisdiction
until they pass Flat Top.


257
00:35:34.838 --> 00:35:37.932
Today my jurisdiction
ends here.


258
00:35:39.443 --> 00:35:41.604
Pick up my hat.

259
00:35:41.678 --> 00:35:43.839
Hey, Langston!

260
00:35:45.115 --> 00:35:46.878
10:00!

261
00:35:57.027 --> 00:35:59.791
This a friend of yours?

262
00:35:59.863 --> 00:36:01.797
He is now.

263
00:36:01.865 --> 00:36:03.298
Who is he?

264
00:36:03.366 --> 00:36:07.700
- A guy who got run out of town.
- Just like us.


265
00:37:29.586 --> 00:37:31.713
Hobart, what are you people
doing here?


266
00:37:31.788 --> 00:37:33.449
Look.

267
00:37:33.523 --> 00:37:37.619
Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb
and stole the money box.


268
00:37:42.766 --> 00:37:44.996
They went north.
We're going after 'em.


269
00:37:45.068 --> 00:37:48.333
Forget the money.
You gotta get these people outta here.


270
00:37:50.073 --> 00:37:52.007
This is bad country.

271
00:37:52.075 --> 00:37:54.976
No place to be setting
with women and kids.


272
00:37:55.045 --> 00:37:59.675
- The next water ain't for three days.
- We got no life without that money.


273
00:37:59.749 --> 00:38:03.241
Everybody put in.
That's our whole stake!


274
00:38:06.022 --> 00:38:09.150
- How long they been gone?
- About an hour.


275
00:38:17.367 --> 00:38:20.200
I'll go with you, Mal.

276
00:38:28.144 --> 00:38:30.078
Deal me in.

277
00:38:35.218 --> 00:38:38.676
Jake, you know the way outta here.

278
00:38:38.755 --> 00:38:42.919
Get this train moving to Silverado fast.
I'll go with these guys.


279
00:38:42.993 --> 00:38:46.554
You men, stay with your wagons
and your families.


280
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.031
- Get rolling, keep your eyes peeled.
- Wait a minute.


281
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.560
Even if you do get the money,
how do we know you'II come back?


282
00:38:55.805 --> 00:38:59.502
If we don't,
you can keep my brother.


283
00:38:59.576 --> 00:39:01.510
I'm trusting you, mister.

284
00:39:01.578 --> 00:39:03.705
You trusted Baxter.

285
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.181
I don't plan on letting these men
out of my sight.


286
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.584
If I brought a pretty lady like that
into a place like this, I'd stay close.


287
00:39:11.655 --> 00:39:13.850
That's none of your business.

288
00:39:13.923 --> 00:39:16.721
Let's get going.

289
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.868
You got a point.
Maybe I better stay here with her.


290
00:39:46.289 --> 00:39:49.884
Let's get turned around
and get these wagons rolling!


291
00:39:49.959 --> 00:39:53.895
Everybody rides! 
Everybody rides!

292
00:40:16.219 --> 00:40:19.950
Hanging around with you is no picnic.

293
00:40:22.926 --> 00:40:25.895
Anybody got any ideas?

294
00:40:27.564 --> 00:40:30.328
You really did it this time, Nord.

295
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.369
Thank you, boss.
Tom did his part, too.


296
00:40:39.876 --> 00:40:41.309
Comin' in!

297
00:40:57.494 --> 00:40:59.621
- Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?
- In a minute.


298
00:40:59.696 --> 00:41:03.097
I wouldn't do that. You're gonna need
every gun when that posse gets here.


299
00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:05.361
Posse? What the hell
are you talking about?


300
00:41:05.435 --> 00:41:09.098
Me and my partner robbed a bank. We
headed out with a posse on our tails.


301
00:41:09.172 --> 00:41:12.767
My partner caught one. He kicked off
while I was looking for this canyon.


302
00:41:12.842 --> 00:41:17.040
You're Dawson, ain't you? Tex LaRue.
I rode with Ry Morris. You know him.


303
00:41:17.113 --> 00:41:21.345
Simms told me there's a hideout here
so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.


304
00:41:21.418 --> 00:41:23.818
Mind?

305
00:41:23.887 --> 00:41:29.348
You brought a posse to my best hideout
and you ask me if I mind?


306
00:41:29.426 --> 00:41:33.726
Mister, I don't know
any of those names.


307
00:41:33.797 --> 00:41:35.731
You're about to die.

308
00:41:35.799 --> 00:41:39.257
Hold on! You don't believe me,
ask them two there.


309
00:41:39.335 --> 00:41:42.463
They saw me and my pal in Turley
before we did the job.


310
00:41:42.539 --> 00:41:46.839
I seen him there all right.
Don't know nothing about any bank job.


311
00:41:49.512 --> 00:41:53.744
If you took the bank in Turley,
where's the money?


312
00:41:55.018 --> 00:41:58.351
I'd get down if I were you.
They might be up there right now.


313
00:41:59.322 --> 00:42:01.415
- No money, huh?
- It's in my saddlebags.


314
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:04.426
I ain't getting out in the open
to get it.


315
00:42:30.887 --> 00:42:33.481
Stop your firin'...

316
00:42:33.556 --> 00:42:36.150
until you see something.

317
00:42:37.393 --> 00:42:41.124
If we charge them, they won't stand
a chance. We gotta get to the horses!


318
00:42:41.197 --> 00:42:44.098
- Horses? What're you talking about?
- Cover me!


319
00:43:03.052 --> 00:43:04.679
Brave man.

320
00:43:04.754 --> 00:43:09.157
I think there's only a couple of guys
up there and this asshole's one of 'em.


321
00:43:19.903 --> 00:43:23.339
Get that guy!
Keep him from getting the horses!


322
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:17.921
That was some idea of yours.
Next time you go in.


323
00:44:19.095 --> 00:44:23.555
I knew it!
Put that box on my horse.


324
00:44:29.272 --> 00:44:31.706
Mister, you got a lot to learn
about people.


325
00:45:02.839 --> 00:45:06.969
They got a place south of Silverado.
Guess they've done okay.


326
00:45:07.043 --> 00:45:09.807
Good enough, anyway,
so when my mama wrote me last time...


327
00:45:09.879 --> 00:45:13.781
she said they needed my help
to work the place.


328
00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.978
That was almost nine months ago
she wrote.


329
00:45:17.053 --> 00:45:21.217
Letter took a while to find me, but
when it did it was just the right time.


330
00:45:22.525 --> 00:45:23.958
Where were you?

331
00:45:25.595 --> 00:45:29.463
Chicago. Working
in the slaughterhouses.


332
00:45:29.532 --> 00:45:32.399
Chicago?
You've been to Chicago?


333
00:45:34.804 --> 00:45:36.863
Was it wonderful?

334
00:45:41.377 --> 00:45:43.675
Hey, Paden...

335
00:45:43.746 --> 00:45:45.680
where you been?

336
00:45:46.749 --> 00:45:48.546
I was just...

337
00:45:48.618 --> 00:45:50.552
checking the...

338
00:45:51.554 --> 00:45:53.488
You know, looking in.

339
00:45:59.829 --> 00:46:03.026
Geez, Paden, her old man
ain't even cold yet.


340
00:46:20.049 --> 00:46:22.950
Looks pretty shallow here.
We could just go off.


341
00:46:35.431 --> 00:46:38.366
Pull 'em up. Yeah.

342
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.144
That's all right
Let 'em go.


343
00:46:49.212 --> 00:46:52.079
The bank is soft on the other side.

344
00:47:05.862 --> 00:47:08.194
Let's go.

345
00:47:34.557 --> 00:47:37.492
Well, this is it, gents.

346
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.326
My mama told me
to head through that notch.


347
00:47:41.397 --> 00:47:43.228
Good luck, Mal.

348
00:47:43.299 --> 00:47:45.790
Maybe we'll see you around sometime.

349
00:47:45.868 --> 00:47:47.358
Yeah, maybe.

350
00:47:48.437 --> 00:47:49.927
So long.

351
00:47:56.245 --> 00:47:58.679
- So long, Mal!
- Bye.


352
00:48:14.931 --> 00:48:20.130
- Hope to see you again, ma'am.
- I'll ride along with the lady.


353
00:48:21.804 --> 00:48:26.104
Take a look at this farmland
before I come into Silverado.


354
00:48:26.175 --> 00:48:29.372
See what makes a trip this hard
worth taking.


355
00:48:31.514 --> 00:48:33.448
I'll see you around.

356
00:48:33.516 --> 00:48:36.451
I'll be around.
Jake, let's go!


357
00:48:51.133 --> 00:48:53.397
See you in Silverado, Paden!

358
00:48:53.469 --> 00:48:55.733
I'll be there.

359
00:49:57.733 --> 00:50:01.328
Mr. And Mrs. Parker have agreed
to join their parcel to mine.


360
00:50:01.404 --> 00:50:03.998
We'll work them together.

361
00:50:04.073 --> 00:50:06.473
Mine starts right over there.

362
00:50:07.677 --> 00:50:09.804
It's all I've ever wanted.

363
00:50:11.013 --> 00:50:13.208
Pretty land, isn't it?

364
00:50:13.282 --> 00:50:15.307
And a pretty lady.

365
00:50:16.786 --> 00:50:20.313
A lot of men have told me that.

366
00:50:20.389 --> 00:50:23.187
Maybe it's true.

367
00:50:23.259 --> 00:50:26.786
I guess some women are slow
to believe it.


368
00:50:26.862 --> 00:50:28.727
Believe it.

369
00:50:30.333 --> 00:50:33.666
They're drawn to me by that,
but it never lasts.


370
00:50:33.736 --> 00:50:35.431
Why?

371
00:50:35.504 --> 00:50:38.701
Because they don't like
what I want.


372
00:50:38.774 --> 00:50:40.742
What's that?

373
00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:43.005
I want to build something.

374
00:50:43.079 --> 00:50:45.013
Make things grow.

375
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:49.381
That takes hard work.
A lifetime of it.


376
00:50:49.452 --> 00:50:53.047
That's not why a man comes
to a pretty woman.


377
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:59.052
After a while,
I won't be so pretty...


378
00:50:59.128 --> 00:51:01.596
but this land will be.

379
00:51:13.576 --> 00:51:15.100
Come here.

380
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:24.244
- Hi, J.T.
- Jake, how are you?


381
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.288
Come on, son.

382
00:51:30.092 --> 00:51:32.117
You remember us?

383
00:51:32.194 --> 00:51:33.718
Yeah.

384
00:51:35.164 --> 00:51:36.927
Hi, Augie.

385
00:51:47.543 --> 00:51:50.808
It's good to be home, Kate.

386
00:52:26.615 --> 00:52:28.173
Daddy?

387
00:52:29.852 --> 00:52:32.582
I saw the light.

388
00:52:32.655 --> 00:52:36.421
I thought maybe Rae
had come back to see me.


389
00:52:36.492 --> 00:52:40.826
I never thought it'd be my boy.
I never thought that!


390
00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:43.856
Mama?

391
00:52:43.933 --> 00:52:46.766
She was sick a long time.

392
00:52:48.704 --> 00:52:51.468
She was sick when she wrote you.

393
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.031
But she didn't say it.

394
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:59.309
I never thought you'd come back,
but she did.


395
00:52:59.381 --> 00:53:04.114
- Where's Rae?
- She's gone. Gone to town.


396
00:53:04.186 --> 00:53:07.519
She hated working the farm...

397
00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:09.751
just like you.

398
00:53:09.825 --> 00:53:11.554
What happened?

399
00:53:11.627 --> 00:53:13.618
They run me off.

400
00:53:13.696 --> 00:53:16.494
They burned me out!

401
00:53:16.565 --> 00:53:19.466
Made it so I couldn't do...

402
00:53:21.036 --> 00:53:23.095
just like Georgia!

403
00:53:23.172 --> 00:53:25.106
You own this land.

404
00:53:25.174 --> 00:53:29.235
I paid the government for it.
That don't mean much out here.


405
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:34.840
Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat
in a cave in them hills.


406
00:53:35.918 --> 00:53:38.079
Hidin' out.

407
00:53:38.154 --> 00:53:42.181
- Afraid to walk my own land.
- What about the law?


408
00:53:42.258 --> 00:53:46.922
Whose law? The law here runs a man down
just like these cattle.


409
00:53:48.898 --> 00:53:50.957
That ain't right.

410
00:53:52.001 --> 00:53:54.697
I had enough of what ain't right.

411
00:53:55.838 --> 00:53:58.898
What we got here is a bad situation.

412
00:53:58.974 --> 00:54:01.704
Those homesteaders you brought in
are gonna make it worse.


413
00:54:01.777 --> 00:54:05.474
When they come to stake their claims,
it's gonna be the start of big trouble.


414
00:54:05.548 --> 00:54:07.573
Gonna cut McKendrick off
in the north.


415
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:12.952
A man could die of thirst before anybody
offered him a drink around here.


416
00:54:16.725 --> 00:54:19.592
Maybe you oughta come to California
with Jake and me.


417
00:54:22.298 --> 00:54:24.664
Augie's gonna grow up here.

418
00:54:24.733 --> 00:54:27.827
There's nothing wrong with the land.
It's just some of the people.


419
00:54:27.903 --> 00:54:31.430
The problem is, Emmett,
you killed the wrong McKendrick.


420
00:54:32.575 --> 00:54:36.671
Watch what you're saying around Augie.
Emmett didn't kill anybody.


421
00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.640
Well, it was self-defense
sure enough.


422
00:54:40.716 --> 00:54:43.913
But I do think you'd have to say
I killed old Murdo.


423
00:54:43.986 --> 00:54:46.318
I think that's definitely the word.

424
00:54:46.388 --> 00:54:51.655
The son is worse than the old man. He's
smoother so you don't hear him coming.


425
00:54:51.727 --> 00:54:53.786
He'll do anything
to keep his range free.


426
00:54:53.862 --> 00:54:58.856
I'm worried what he's gonna do
when he finds out you boys are back.


427
00:54:58.934 --> 00:55:02.062
I think Jake here
can take care of himself.


428
00:55:02.137 --> 00:55:05.004
I just did five years
I didn't owe.


429
00:55:05.074 --> 00:55:09.204
McKendrick oughta be satisfied with that
and let it lie.


430
00:55:13.716 --> 00:55:16.514
What brings you out of your hole,
Johnson?


431
00:55:18.153 --> 00:55:20.144
Who's that with you, Ezra?

432
00:55:20.222 --> 00:55:24.215
This is my son.
He's come home.


433
00:55:24.293 --> 00:55:28.593
Ain't that sweet, Red?

434
00:55:29.665 --> 00:55:34.693
- You're trespassing on McKendrick land.
- You got it all wrong, mister.


435
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.568
- This is our place.
- What?


436
00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.404
Mr. McKendrick bought this place
from your father.


437
00:55:40.476 --> 00:55:42.808
That's a lie!

438
00:55:42.878 --> 00:55:46.439
Tomorrow we're going to town and
straighten that out once and for all.


439
00:55:46.515 --> 00:55:49.643
The next day we'll be back here
farming.


440
00:55:49.718 --> 00:55:52.243
And them cattle better be gone.

441
00:55:52.321 --> 00:55:57.486
If I find any cattle
on our land after tomorrow...


442
00:55:57.559 --> 00:56:00.119
I'm gonna start carving 'em
into steaks.


443
00:56:00.195 --> 00:56:03.221
And believe me,
that's one thing I know about.


444
00:56:03.299 --> 00:56:07.963
Killing cattle is a hanging offense
in these parts.


445
00:56:08.037 --> 00:56:12.337
If we shot you down right now,
we'd be within our rights.


446
00:56:12.408 --> 00:56:16.538
You ever seen what a Henry rifle can do
in the hands of an expert?


447
00:56:16.612 --> 00:56:20.013
Who would that be? You?

448
00:56:26.555 --> 00:56:28.955
This ain't the end of it.

449
00:57:26.882 --> 00:57:29.544
What can I do you for, stranger?

450
00:57:33.255 --> 00:57:36.190
- You work here?
- I run the place.


451
00:57:36.258 --> 00:57:39.022
- What can I get you?
- Bourbon.


452
00:57:39.094 --> 00:57:40.652
Right.

453
00:57:53.409 --> 00:57:54.933
Nifty.

454
00:57:55.010 --> 00:58:00.141
The world is what you make of it.
If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.


455
00:58:00.215 --> 00:58:03.946
I'll drink to that.
Will you join me, Miss...


456
00:58:04.019 --> 00:58:06.044
Stella.

457
00:58:06.121 --> 00:58:08.146
Paden.

458
00:58:13.962 --> 00:58:15.395
Stella.

459
00:58:15.464 --> 00:58:18.194
Are you the Midnight Star herself?

460
00:58:19.201 --> 00:58:24.036
I am. I'm always there,
but I only shine at night.


461
00:58:30.679 --> 00:58:32.806
Compliments to you, Miss Stella.

462
00:58:32.881 --> 00:58:35.441
This is what I call a saloon.

463
00:58:35.517 --> 00:58:38.281
Thanks. That's what I call it, too.

464
00:58:38.353 --> 00:58:41.880
- And I know what I'm talking about.
- You like a good saloon?


465
00:58:41.957 --> 00:58:44.118
It's the only place I'm happy.

466
00:58:44.193 --> 00:58:48.425
Me, too!
What's wrong with us?


467
00:58:51.066 --> 00:58:54.593
You wouldn't be needing any help
around here, say, with the gambling?


468
00:58:56.038 --> 00:59:00.805
See that fellow playing with his hair?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner.


469
00:59:00.876 --> 00:59:04.573
- He runs that side.
- So-called?


470
00:59:04.646 --> 00:59:07.979
Yeah. Apart from being
a loudmouthed, lying cheat...


471
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:10.484
he's just the man
I would've picked.


472
00:59:10.552 --> 00:59:13.521
- Why'd you go into business with him?
- I don't own this place.


473
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:16.888
The man who does,
stuck me with Kelly.


474
00:59:16.959 --> 00:59:20.725
- Who's the owner?
- Here he comes right now.


475
00:59:34.343 --> 00:59:37.073
Well, look at this.

476
00:59:37.145 --> 00:59:40.876
Two of my favorite people
in the world talking to each other.


477
00:59:43.852 --> 00:59:48.755
Stella, this is one of my oldest
surviving friends.


478
00:59:48.824 --> 00:59:52.453
- Treat him right.
- That was my plan.


479
00:59:52.528 --> 00:59:56.464
You two are gonna get along just fine.
You got a lot in common. Kelly!


480
00:59:56.532 --> 00:59:58.762
Get over here.

481
00:59:58.834 --> 01:00:02.565
You didn't come all this way just
to pay me back that money, did you?


482
01:00:03.705 --> 01:00:06.469
- Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
- Howdy.


483
01:00:06.542 --> 01:00:11.036
Give the man a line of credit.
He already owes the house 13 bucks.


484
01:00:14.216 --> 01:00:18.710
- You got a place to stay?
- I just got into town.


485
01:00:18.787 --> 01:00:23.781
- We still got that extra room out back?
- It's not in use at the moment.


486
01:00:26.762 --> 01:00:29.890
What brings you to my saloon?

487
01:00:29.965 --> 01:00:31.899
Luck, I guess.

488
01:00:33.502 --> 01:00:35.697
Good old Paden.

489
01:00:35.771 --> 01:00:39.002
I was hoping maybe you'd changed
your mind about the job.


490
01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:42.408
You didn't tell me
you owned a saloon.


491
01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.116
That ain't the half of it, friend.

492
01:00:48.183 --> 01:00:51.175
Welcome to heaven.

493
01:01:27.422 --> 01:01:30.118
Where's the other one, Johnson?

494
01:01:30.192 --> 01:01:33.684
Our orders are to run you two
out of here.


495
01:01:40.402 --> 01:01:43.200
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, old man?


496
01:01:44.773 --> 01:01:47.936
You tell us where your son is.
There don't have to be any shooting.


497
01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:52.071
You're lying, Hoyt,
like always!


498
01:01:52.147 --> 01:01:54.911
Not this time.
I got my orders.


499
01:01:54.983 --> 01:01:57.213
My son's on the way to town.

500
01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.354
That's too bad.

501
01:02:01.657 --> 01:02:04.057
You're just gonna have to go
by yourself.


502
01:02:14.836 --> 01:02:16.269
Daddy?

503
01:03:22.137 --> 01:03:26.198
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman.

504
01:03:26.274 --> 01:03:30.472
- But she's got a hard idea for living.
- Yeah?


505
01:03:31.913 --> 01:03:35.508
All I'm saying is you won't trip over me
if you look her up.


506
01:03:35.584 --> 01:03:38.212
I'm going to California
with my brother.


507
01:03:39.287 --> 01:03:43.883
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett.
He's a friend of mine.


508
01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:47.326
- This is Sheriff Cobb.
- Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.


509
01:03:47.395 --> 01:03:51.195
The pleasure's mine. Always happy
to meet a friend of Paden's.


510
01:03:51.266 --> 01:03:53.700
Stella, bring Kelly out here,
will you?


511
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:58.262
Aren't you Kate Hollis' brother?

512
01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.773
That's right.

513
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:04.767
You're the one who killed
old Murdo McKendrick.


514
01:04:06.848 --> 01:04:10.079
I didn't have much choice. He was about
to shoot my brother in the back.


515
01:04:12.354 --> 01:04:15.084
Can't be having that now, can we?

516
01:04:18.059 --> 01:04:19.617
Wanna see me?

517
01:04:19.694 --> 01:04:24.222
Kelly, we're gonna make
an adjustment.


518
01:04:24.299 --> 01:04:27.564
I wanted you to be here
when I offered Paden your job.


519
01:04:28.637 --> 01:04:30.764
I think he could do it
without getting greedy.


520
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:36.367
Stella and I are tired of you
skimming our profits.


521
01:04:36.444 --> 01:04:41.006
- What are you talking about?
- I'm done talking. Get out.


522
01:04:41.082 --> 01:04:44.210
- You can't do this.
- Really?


523
01:05:00.669 --> 01:05:02.603
Want the job?

524
01:05:03.705 --> 01:05:05.673
I see you're an understanding boss.

525
01:05:07.409 --> 01:05:10.139
Nothing like that
would ever happen between us.


526
01:05:12.714 --> 01:05:15.911
Maybe we oughta ask Stella?

527
01:05:18.687 --> 01:05:20.655
You'd be welcome.

528
01:05:20.722 --> 01:05:23.486
No, Kelly, he'll kill you!

529
01:05:30.999 --> 01:05:33.695
Thanks for warning me.

530
01:05:44.412 --> 01:05:48.041
Didn't have much choice.

531
01:06:00.762 --> 01:06:03.162
All right, stand back.

532
01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:16.234
I never enjoy killing a man.

533
01:06:30.158 --> 01:06:34.390
Excuse me. Sheriff, I'm a gambler
who'd like to run an honest game here.


534
01:06:34.462 --> 01:06:38.728
To whom do I speak about that?
I hope it's not this gentleman.


535
01:06:46.274 --> 01:06:48.299
That's him.

536
01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:53.077
I better find somebody
to clean up this mess.


537
01:06:57.552 --> 01:07:00.817
You used to ride with that guy?

538
01:07:11.967 --> 01:07:14.800
What are you doing?

539
01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:18.305
I told you to practice on a horse
that's not moving, huh?


540
01:07:24.446 --> 01:07:26.846
Where are you going?

541
01:07:26.915 --> 01:07:30.078
I got things to do, kid.
I'm a busy man.


542
01:07:30.151 --> 01:07:32.415
I'll go with you.

543
01:07:32.487 --> 01:07:37.390
A grown man can't have a little boy
with him everywhere he goes.


544
01:07:37.459 --> 01:07:39.757
Who's a grown man?

545
01:07:50.672 --> 01:07:52.435
Hello, Rae.

546
01:07:58.246 --> 01:08:02.478
What are you doing here?
I thought you were done with our family.


547
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:04.575
Daddy's dead.

548
01:08:09.124 --> 01:08:11.718
He was murdered.

549
01:08:11.793 --> 01:08:13.351
Who did it?

550
01:08:13.428 --> 01:08:17.524
I'm not sure, but I've got an idea.
When I'm sure, they gonna pay.


551
01:08:18.633 --> 01:08:20.692
That's just fine.

552
01:08:20.769 --> 01:08:24.170
Where were you when Mama and Daddy
needed you? It's too late, Mal.


553
01:08:24.239 --> 01:08:29.142
Now you finally show up, and all you
can think is to get yourself killed.


554
01:08:34.716 --> 01:08:38.083
- You okay, Rae?
- Yeah, I'm okay.


555
01:08:39.521 --> 01:08:41.648
Introduce me to your friend.

556
01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:45.557
He's not my friend.
He used to be my brother.


557
01:08:48.196 --> 01:08:52.155
Calvin Stanhope.
But my mother called me "Slick."


558
01:08:55.904 --> 01:08:57.633
Excuse me.

559
01:09:01.076 --> 01:09:04.842
- Why are you here? This ain't for you.
- That's none of your business.


560
01:09:08.383 --> 01:09:12.376
Rae, all we got is each other.

561
01:09:13.521 --> 01:09:16.490
I don't have any family anymore.

562
01:09:44.586 --> 01:09:47.180
I'm surprised to see you
out here today.


563
01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:53.526
Just come out to say good-bye.

564
01:09:53.595 --> 01:09:55.324
Good-bye?

565
01:09:55.396 --> 01:10:00.129
Yeah. Jake and me will be heading out
for California soon.


566
01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:05.665
You came all the way out here just
to tell me you're going to California?


567
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.369
All you had to do was go.
We'd never see each other again.


568
01:10:09.444 --> 01:10:13.039
- That's why I'm here.
- Why?


569
01:10:14.616 --> 01:10:16.914
You don't make it easy on a fella.

570
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:23.416
Maybe you thought
you'd be back this way someday.


571
01:10:26.194 --> 01:10:27.627
Yeah.

572
01:10:28.596 --> 01:10:31.064
That must've been it.

573
01:10:40.542 --> 01:10:42.601
It's McKendrick's men!

574
01:11:32.527 --> 01:11:33.892
Move!

575
01:11:46.241 --> 01:11:48.175
All right, let's go!

576
01:12:00.955 --> 01:12:04.891
Goddamn it! We won't quit!
You bastards!


577
01:12:13.334 --> 01:12:15.268
Is that a fair mix?

578
01:12:15.336 --> 01:12:19.864
I'm saving lives here. Straight stuff
would raise a blister on boot leather.


579
01:12:20.875 --> 01:12:23.469
I meant it seemed like
a lot of whiskey.


580
01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.475
- What's this?
- That's the good stuff.


581
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.780
Yeah? How good?

582
01:12:45.166 --> 01:12:49.068
- Here's to the good stuff.
- May it last a long time.


583
01:12:52.373 --> 01:12:54.307
You better get out here.

584
01:12:57.312 --> 01:13:01.043
- Nothing happened. This is my job.
- Shut up.


585
01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:05.381
I don't believe a lady has to explain
anything to a man this ugly.


586
01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:12.456
What's the trouble here?

587
01:13:12.527 --> 01:13:14.461
Stay out of this, Paden.

588
01:13:14.529 --> 01:13:17.726
He can't do that.
Cobb's hired him.


589
01:13:17.799 --> 01:13:20.233
That's Cobb's mistake.

590
01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:22.599
Come out of there, Phoebe.
You've done enough.


591
01:13:31.713 --> 01:13:33.146
Go home.

592
01:13:34.082 --> 01:13:36.482
All I did was kiss the girl.

593
01:13:37.752 --> 01:13:41.153
That's what you said in Turley.
Remember how that ended?


594
01:13:42.557 --> 01:13:46.186
What's the matter? You afraid
I couldn't get those two behind me?


595
01:13:47.729 --> 01:13:50.129
I don't want you gettin' anybody
in my place.


596
01:13:56.971 --> 01:13:58.404
Boom.

597
01:14:04.479 --> 01:14:06.709
I should've killed you
a long time ago.


598
01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:11.785
Why not now?

599
01:14:21.129 --> 01:14:23.495
Don't do it, Tyree.

600
01:14:23.564 --> 01:14:27.523
I just lost a partner. If you kill him,
I'll never get anyone to work in here.


601
01:14:28.836 --> 01:14:30.895
You better start lookin'.

602
01:14:57.265 --> 01:14:59.995
You really are a gambler, aren't you?

603
01:15:08.276 --> 01:15:10.710
Give me some of the good stuff.

604
01:15:23.758 --> 01:15:26.556
Whoa! Hold it.
Sorry about that.


605
01:15:29.363 --> 01:15:32.764
- Where'd you get this horse?
- This is my uncle's horse.


606
01:15:32.834 --> 01:15:36.395
- Like hell it is.
- What's the problem, Swann?


607
01:15:37.538 --> 01:15:41.099
Yeah.
What's the problem?


608
01:15:46.814 --> 01:15:48.247
Emmett.

609
01:15:48.883 --> 01:15:50.316
McKendrick.

610
01:15:59.227 --> 01:16:01.252
I didn't know you were out.

611
01:16:01.329 --> 01:16:03.388
Seem short to you?

612
01:16:04.265 --> 01:16:07.996
That's all over with as far
as I'm concerned. I'm satisfied.


613
01:16:08.069 --> 01:16:10.162
Sounds good.

614
01:16:10.238 --> 01:16:13.765
All right, then.
Let's go.


615
01:16:15.877 --> 01:16:18.107
- Don't you recognize this pinto?
- What?


616
01:16:18.179 --> 01:16:20.909
- That's Lee's horse.
- Shut up, Swann.


617
01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:24.580
Wait a minute.

618
01:16:26.721 --> 01:16:28.814
Get down from there, Augie.

619
01:16:55.316 --> 01:16:58.342
The man who lost this horse
must've been working for you.


620
01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.345
I should've known.

621
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:04.620
You changed your brand, Ethan.

622
01:17:04.692 --> 01:17:08.788
A lot of things changed
when my father died.


623
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:43.927
- He must be pretty good.
- He's good, all right.


624
01:17:43.998 --> 01:17:46.296
Too good for my men.

625
01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:48.835
That's why you've
gotta take care of it.


626
01:17:50.137 --> 01:17:53.937
- What about his brother?
- We'II handle that.


627
01:17:54.008 --> 01:17:56.067
He's careless.

628
01:17:57.945 --> 01:17:59.936
Things are gettin' messy around here.

629
01:18:02.016 --> 01:18:04.484
I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.

630
01:18:04.552 --> 01:18:06.486
I heard that, too.

631
01:18:07.722 --> 01:18:09.883
Did you hear his son
is still around?


632
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:17.219
Cobb, looks like you're finally
gonna earn your money.


633
01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:26.233
From what I've seen,
Paden doesn't care about money.


634
01:18:26.307 --> 01:18:28.332
He says he doesn't care about anything,
but he does.


635
01:18:28.409 --> 01:18:30.741
There's just no tellin'
what it's gonna be.


636
01:18:30.811 --> 01:18:32.745
Howdy, Mr. Slick.

637
01:18:32.813 --> 01:18:35.714
Let me tell you
about your friend Paden.


638
01:18:35.783 --> 01:18:38.581
Me, him, Tyree and a few others...

639
01:18:38.653 --> 01:18:41.213
did a good bit of riding together
a few years back.


640
01:18:41.288 --> 01:18:45.315
Business was pretty good.

641
01:18:45.393 --> 01:18:49.762
We were movin' around a lot the way you
have to in that line of work.


642
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:52.924
Somewhere along the line
we picked up this dog.


643
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.959
One of the boys took to feedin' it,
so it followed us everywhere.


644
01:18:57.038 --> 01:19:00.166
One time we were leaving
a little Missouri town...


645
01:19:00.241 --> 01:19:03.733
with a bunch of locals
hot on our tail.


646
01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:07.679
This dog got tangled up
with Tyree's horse.


647
01:19:07.748 --> 01:19:09.773
Tyree went flyin'.

648
01:19:11.419 --> 01:19:15.719
Tyree was mad, and being Tyree...

649
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:17.815
he shot the dog.

650
01:19:17.892 --> 01:19:19.951
He didn't kill him, though.

651
01:19:20.027 --> 01:19:23.087
Before you know it,
Paden is off his horse...


652
01:19:23.164 --> 01:19:25.291
and he's holding this dog.

653
01:19:25.366 --> 01:19:28.597
He got strange,
said we should go on without him.


654
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:31.638
I thought he was kidding,
but he wasn't.


655
01:19:31.706 --> 01:19:35.472
Tyree was ready to plug 'em both.
All this with a posse after us.


656
01:19:37.778 --> 01:19:41.544
I thought we were pals
after all the ridin' we'd done together.


657
01:19:41.615 --> 01:19:44.675
All of a sudden he's worried
about some mutt.


658
01:19:45.853 --> 01:19:48.583
We did like he asked
and we left him.


659
01:19:49.623 --> 01:19:52.217
He went to jail for a dog.

660
01:19:53.694 --> 01:19:56.492
You want to hear the funny part?

661
01:19:56.564 --> 01:19:59.158
Paden didn't even like that damn dog.

662
01:20:00.835 --> 01:20:03.235
It evened out in the end.

663
01:20:03.304 --> 01:20:05.238
They locked me up.

664
01:20:05.306 --> 01:20:07.433
The dog sprung me.

665
01:20:08.242 --> 01:20:10.176
Where's the dog now?

666
01:20:11.579 --> 01:20:13.513
He left me.

667
01:20:15.082 --> 01:20:17.983
Come on, Paden.
I'll buy you a drink.


668
01:20:29.764 --> 01:20:32.096
I took out $13.

669
01:20:35.936 --> 01:20:37.870
This is a lot of money.

670
01:20:37.938 --> 01:20:40.600
I told you this was a sweet setup.

671
01:20:40.674 --> 01:20:42.733
It is that.

672
01:20:43.544 --> 01:20:46.138
Maybe you could run it without Stella.

673
01:20:48.649 --> 01:20:51.015
This is her life.

674
01:20:51.085 --> 01:20:53.553
I'll go before she does.

675
01:20:53.621 --> 01:20:56.181
Easy, boy.
It's just an idea.


676
01:20:56.257 --> 01:20:58.225
Thanks but forget it.

677
01:21:01.462 --> 01:21:05.489
Paden, what makes all this work...

678
01:21:05.566 --> 01:21:07.534
is me doing my job.

679
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:12.264
Those fellows you come to town with
are causing some trouble.


680
01:21:12.339 --> 01:21:14.705
It's gonna take
some straightening out.


681
01:21:15.676 --> 01:21:17.769
I have my responsibilities.

682
01:21:17.845 --> 01:21:21.303
I want you to understand
it has nothing to do with us.


683
01:21:22.216 --> 01:21:24.446
What is it you want from me?

684
01:21:24.518 --> 01:21:25.951
Nothin'.

685
01:21:26.754 --> 01:21:28.187
Do nothin'.

686
01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:30.782
Don't get between us.

687
01:21:33.894 --> 01:21:36.795
I'm a great believer in doing nothin'.

688
01:21:38.098 --> 01:21:40.464
We understand each other.

689
01:21:42.369 --> 01:21:44.701
Don't worry about me.

690
01:21:44.772 --> 01:21:49.232
If you're taking on Emmett, the last
place I want to be is between you.


691
01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.793
You're empty.

692
01:23:31.912 --> 01:23:33.846
Ain't you dead yet?

693
01:23:33.914 --> 01:23:36.405
Cobb said he'd be hard to kill.

694
01:23:36.483 --> 01:23:39.611
I guess you couldn't hear us comin'.

695
01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:43.120
He was practicing so hard
for a fight...


696
01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:46.182
he missed the whole thing.

697
01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.887
So long, stranger.

698
01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:55.893
I don't wanna kill you
and you don't wanna be dead.


699
01:23:57.338 --> 01:23:59.272
He can't be that good.

700
01:24:00.474 --> 01:24:02.066
You wanna find out?

701
01:24:04.845 --> 01:24:07.040
I think we should do like he says.

702
01:24:27.868 --> 01:24:29.836
How you feeling?

703
01:24:30.771 --> 01:24:33.535
I'd be a lot worse
if you hadn't come along.


704
01:24:33.607 --> 01:24:36.576
I didn't just come along.
I was lookin' for you.


705
01:24:36.643 --> 01:24:39.771
Jake said you were out there.

706
01:24:39.847 --> 01:24:44.011
He told me about that business
the other day.


707
01:24:44.084 --> 01:24:48.077
He said you boys took
a Henry rifle...


708
01:24:48.155 --> 01:24:50.282
off one of McKendrick's men.

709
01:24:51.258 --> 01:24:54.455
- I wanted to see it.
- That's it.


710
01:25:01.335 --> 01:25:06.500
This was my father's.
The man who killed him took it.


711
01:25:08.242 --> 01:25:09.675
I'm sorry.

712
01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.241
I gotta get to my brother. They come
after me, they'll want him, too.


713
01:25:17.317 --> 01:25:19.410
- You'll never make it.
- I've got to.


714
01:25:23.357 --> 01:25:24.790
I'II go.

715
01:25:30.898 --> 01:25:32.490
I'll bring Jake here.

716
01:25:40.707 --> 01:25:43.437
You be careful.

717
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:45.808
You're in it now.

718
01:25:45.879 --> 01:25:48.404
It's gonna get mean.

719
01:26:03.931 --> 01:26:06.559
Augie, I've had enough of this.

720
01:26:06.633 --> 01:26:09.193
Kiss your father
and get in bed.


721
01:26:22.883 --> 01:26:24.874
Get out.
We have nothing to talk about.


722
01:26:24.952 --> 01:26:27.978
- I need help.
- Why come to me?


723
01:26:28.055 --> 01:26:31.513
Because you're my sister.
There's nobody else.


724
01:26:37.097 --> 01:26:40.726
The men who killed Daddy are after Jake.
I've gotta talk to him.


725
01:26:40.801 --> 01:26:44.259
- What's stoppin' you?
- They're watching. I can't get through.


726
01:26:45.305 --> 01:26:47.239
What makes you think I could?

727
01:26:47.307 --> 01:26:49.434
Why would they stop you?

728
01:26:52.212 --> 01:26:54.544
'Cause I'm your sister.

729
01:26:55.616 --> 01:26:58.050
He ain't in the saloon, either.

730
01:27:01.788 --> 01:27:04.313
Where is that boy?

731
01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:08.160
You're crazy!

732
01:27:23.377 --> 01:27:26.540
- Why him?
- You need help, don't you?


733
01:27:34.888 --> 01:27:36.913
Jake said he'd meet you
behind the church.


734
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:39.288
Be careful.
They're all over the place.


735
01:27:40.427 --> 01:27:41.860
Thanks.

736
01:27:43.063 --> 01:27:44.496
Good luck.

737
01:28:02.349 --> 01:28:04.874
You must be Ezra Johnson's boy.

738
01:28:05.819 --> 01:28:08.253
Now don't shoot the sheriff.

739
01:28:09.423 --> 01:28:11.357
That's against the law.

740
01:28:15.462 --> 01:28:18.022
So is killing a deputy.

741
01:28:24.404 --> 01:28:27.066
We're gonna give you a fair trial...

742
01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:31.644
followed by a first-class hangin'.

743
01:28:32.946 --> 01:28:36.006
Or you could ride out of here
before dawn.


744
01:28:37.484 --> 01:28:41.011
You just have to tell me where
I can find your friend Emmett.


745
01:28:57.604 --> 01:28:59.538
Why are they doing this?

746
01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.501
Because they enjoy it.

747
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:07.505
- What happened to Emmett?
- Cobb's men almost killed him.


748
01:29:07.581 --> 01:29:09.742
That's what happened.

749
01:29:09.816 --> 01:29:12.046
I got there just short of too late.

750
01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:15.520
Lucky.

751
01:29:17.124 --> 01:29:18.557
Yeah.

752
01:29:19.726 --> 01:29:21.956
It's working out real good.

753
01:29:23.463 --> 01:29:25.397
Where's Emmett now?

754
01:29:26.333 --> 01:29:29.131
You're working for Cobb these days,
aren't you?


755
01:29:32.439 --> 01:29:36.000
Your friends have been beating me
to find that out.


756
01:29:36.076 --> 01:29:38.567
You think I'm just gonna tell you?

757
01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.108
You waltzed in here easy.

758
01:29:43.183 --> 01:29:45.549
You can go out the same way.

759
01:29:47.054 --> 01:29:49.921
Me they figure to carry out.

760
01:30:12.679 --> 01:30:14.772
Is he all right?

761
01:30:14.848 --> 01:30:17.510
Looks bad, Rae.

762
01:30:17.584 --> 01:30:19.711
He's a hard man.

763
01:30:19.786 --> 01:30:22.118
He won't give them what they want.

764
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:24.384
It's gonna cost him.

765
01:30:24.458 --> 01:30:26.187
Can't you stop 'em?

766
01:30:28.228 --> 01:30:30.196
I don't think so.

767
01:30:36.436 --> 01:30:38.427
What is it?

768
01:30:53.253 --> 01:30:56.620
Oh, Kate.

769
01:30:56.690 --> 01:30:58.123
Sweet Kate.

770
01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:21.645
Don't.

771
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:27.818
Jake's been with me all evening.
I just left him.


772
01:31:27.888 --> 01:31:30.356
- Where is he now?
- Went home.


773
01:31:34.161 --> 01:31:38.689
Been with you all evening?
Even after Slick came to get him?


774
01:31:38.765 --> 01:31:40.733
Slick didn't come.

775
01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:48.927
Stop it!

776
01:32:49.002 --> 01:32:50.936
He saw us.

777
01:32:51.004 --> 01:32:52.437
Bring him.

778
01:33:32.245 --> 01:33:33.678
Fire!

779
01:33:33.747 --> 01:33:36.477
The land office is on fire!

780
01:33:50.931 --> 01:33:52.364
Help J.T.

781
01:33:52.432 --> 01:33:54.832
Where's Augie?
Her boy must be upstairs.


782
01:33:54.901 --> 01:33:58.860
No. No.
They took him.


783
01:33:58.939 --> 01:34:01.464
They took my Augie.

784
01:34:11.484 --> 01:34:14.419
You go around the back of the house.

785
01:34:14.487 --> 01:34:17.354
Wyoming, you go over there
and help out.


786
01:34:21.494 --> 01:34:24.361
Tom, you help with the buckets, too.

787
01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:26.695
Nathan, help with that wagon.

788
01:35:08.341 --> 01:35:10.275
Give it up.

789
01:35:14.414 --> 01:35:18.077
I hate to see this kind of thing
in my town.


790
01:35:18.151 --> 01:35:20.676
Gonna have to look into this.

791
01:35:20.754 --> 01:35:22.415
Maybe I will, too.

792
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:25.920
I thought we talked about that.

793
01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.828
We didn't talk about this.

794
01:35:31.197 --> 01:35:33.631
They took the little boy, Cobb.

795
01:35:56.156 --> 01:35:58.954
You're still worried about the dog,
aren't you?


796
01:36:00.927 --> 01:36:03.953
You've gotta calm down. Everything
will be put straight in a few days.


797
01:36:05.031 --> 01:36:09.365
Yeah. I saw how you put
Mal Johnson straight.


798
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:18.769
Never could count on you
to be reasonable.


799
01:36:20.113 --> 01:36:23.048
Don't force me to make an adjustment
around here.


800
01:36:25.952 --> 01:36:29.786
Cobb, you got nothing I need.

801
01:36:32.525 --> 01:36:34.823
I'm not thinking
about your future, Paden.


802
01:36:36.262 --> 01:36:38.230
I'm worried about Stella.

803
01:36:44.204 --> 01:36:46.570
What's she got to do with this?

804
01:36:48.007 --> 01:36:49.941
Not a thing.

805
01:36:51.211 --> 01:36:53.338
She's just a mutual friend.

806
01:36:55.515 --> 01:36:59.315
But if you wind up
on the wrong side of this...


807
01:36:59.385 --> 01:37:01.319
she's gonna get hurt.

808
01:37:05.925 --> 01:37:08.393
I'm trying to save you from yourself.

809
01:37:09.362 --> 01:37:11.353
Don't change your luck.

810
01:37:44.597 --> 01:37:48.089
- What is it that I can't figure?
- What do you mean?


811
01:37:49.302 --> 01:37:54.296
Cobb's got something on you
and it must be pretty good.


812
01:37:54.374 --> 01:37:56.399
What makes you say that?

813
01:37:56.476 --> 01:37:59.775
If he didn't, you'd never sit still
with all this going on.


814
01:37:59.846 --> 01:38:02.041
You sure?

815
01:38:02.115 --> 01:38:04.242
Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.

816
01:38:06.953 --> 01:38:08.545
What's he got?

817
01:38:17.297 --> 01:38:21.063
Cobb says there's no tellin'
what you're gonna care about.


818
01:38:22.769 --> 01:38:24.737
Is that what he said?

819
01:38:27.106 --> 01:38:29.904
He figured it okay this time.

820
01:38:58.905 --> 01:39:02.932
Look who's here, Johnson.
Your sweet little sister.


821
01:39:03.009 --> 01:39:07.708
Maybe I better search her.
It won't be easy.


822
01:39:08.615 --> 01:39:11.243
I've only got one good hand.

823
01:39:48.054 --> 01:39:50.852
Garth, you in there?

824
01:40:12.378 --> 01:40:14.608
To my Midnight Star.

825
01:40:15.982 --> 01:40:18.883
Cobb's using me to stop you.

826
01:40:20.386 --> 01:40:24.789
Good people are being hurt
because of me.


827
01:40:24.857 --> 01:40:26.984
That makes me mad.

828
01:40:29.662 --> 01:40:33.598
Some people think
because they're stronger or meaner...


829
01:40:33.666 --> 01:40:36.032
they can push you around.

830
01:40:36.102 --> 01:40:38.400
I've seen a lot of that.

831
01:40:39.305 --> 01:40:43.207
But it's only true
if you let it be.


832
01:40:43.276 --> 01:40:46.006
The world's what you make of it.

833
01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:51.310
I like your attitude,
but it can be risky.


834
01:40:52.919 --> 01:40:55.945
I'm ready for that.

835
01:40:56.022 --> 01:40:57.956
What about you?

836
01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:02.419
I don't want you to get hurt.

837
01:41:05.631 --> 01:41:10.000
He can't hurt me
if he's dead.


838
01:41:21.114 --> 01:41:23.207
Stella, come quick.

839
01:41:30.523 --> 01:41:34.152
She sprung her brother all by herself
and this is what happened.


840
01:41:34.227 --> 01:41:37.628
- He brought her here.
- Where'd he go?


841
01:41:37.697 --> 01:41:42.396
I told him about Jake and the
little boy. He went off after Emmett.


842
01:41:42.468 --> 01:41:46.268
Stop crying. Get Doc Skinner
and bring him to the shed.


843
01:41:49.842 --> 01:41:52.743
Pick her up.
I've got a place to hide her.


844
01:41:55.281 --> 01:41:58.842
You better get in there with her
until this thing is over.


845
01:42:23.976 --> 01:42:25.910
Where's Jake?

846
01:42:25.978 --> 01:42:29.345
- McKendrick's men got him.
- Is he alive?


847
01:42:33.086 --> 01:42:35.054
It's worse than that.

848
01:42:35.121 --> 01:42:37.351
They took him at your sister's house.

849
01:42:37.423 --> 01:42:39.914
Her husband was shot. I don't know
if he's gonna make it.


850
01:42:40.993 --> 01:42:43.223
- Kate?
- She was hurt.


851
01:42:44.931 --> 01:42:46.364
Pretty bad.

852
01:42:50.670 --> 01:42:52.900
They took the little boy with them.

853
01:43:46.826 --> 01:43:48.589
Put on one of these.

854
01:43:50.263 --> 01:43:52.197
This ought to do.

855
01:44:30.603 --> 01:44:32.400
Garth?

856
01:44:32.471 --> 01:44:33.904
Fox!

857
01:44:40.246 --> 01:44:44.774
Get Kyle and Dusty over here.
And keep your eyes open.


858
01:44:44.850 --> 01:44:47.375
We're running out of deputies.

859
01:47:04.190 --> 01:47:06.021
Stampede!

860
01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:10.081
Turn 'em around!

861
01:49:02.541 --> 01:49:03.974
Go!

862
01:49:46.385 --> 01:49:48.410
Augie, where's Jake?

863
01:49:48.487 --> 01:49:49.954
He's dead.

864
01:49:50.022 --> 01:49:51.455
What?

865
01:49:52.358 --> 01:49:55.350
He was trying to get away...

866
01:49:55.427 --> 01:49:58.692
and he fell off his horse,
off a cliff.


867
01:50:00.199 --> 01:50:02.895
Jake fell off his horse?

868
01:50:06.238 --> 01:50:08.229
It's all right.

869
01:51:22.114 --> 01:51:24.776
Yeah! Where's Emmett?

870
01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:26.283
Inside.

871
01:51:28.687 --> 01:51:31.713
- Where have you been?
- Playing dead.


872
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.451
- Let's get out of here.
- Right.


873
01:52:27.379 --> 01:52:29.711
- Jake!
- Uncle Jake!


874
01:52:31.316 --> 01:52:32.749
Hi, guys.

875
01:52:37.322 --> 01:52:39.256
Come on, Augie.

876
01:52:41.226 --> 01:52:43.820
Come on, Augie, jump.

877
01:52:43.896 --> 01:52:45.329
Come on!

878
01:52:50.169 --> 01:52:52.467
He's on the roof, Paden.

879
01:53:45.524 --> 01:53:48.152
It never should've got this far, Cobb.

880
01:53:48.227 --> 01:53:50.320
This is as far as it's goin'.

881
01:53:50.395 --> 01:53:52.625
I'll do my part...

882
01:53:52.698 --> 01:53:55.132
but you better watch your ass.

883
01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.566
These guys will shoot it off.

884
01:54:11.517 --> 01:54:13.883
I'm gonna enjoy this.

885
01:54:16.388 --> 01:54:18.856
It used to be a peaceful town.

886
01:54:22.594 --> 01:54:25.028
What's goin' on, Sheriff?

887
01:54:26.632 --> 01:54:29.032
Hide and watch.

888
01:54:38.343 --> 01:54:41.744
Everybody off the streets.
There's gonna be trouble.


889
01:54:58.030 --> 01:55:01.466
- Any sign of Stella?
- Been looking.


890
01:55:01.533 --> 01:55:05.060
- See if you can find Rae.
- Yeah.


891
01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:38.958
You wait till we get back.
Don't come in.


892
01:55:48.213 --> 01:55:50.147
See you around.

893
01:55:51.250 --> 01:55:53.616
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.

894
01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.553
You're on.

895
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:59.721
Let's get 'em!

896
01:56:02.895 --> 01:56:04.419
Hey, Paden.

897
01:56:06.198 --> 01:56:07.631
Good luck.

898
01:56:33.525 --> 01:56:36.187
I'm going for the doctor.

899
01:56:36.261 --> 01:56:38.729
You're going to be all right.

900
01:57:30.682 --> 01:57:33.116
Don't be afraid, baby.

901
01:57:33.185 --> 01:57:37.281
I'll stay with you
until your little friend comes back.


902
01:57:44.863 --> 01:57:48.162
Come on out, boys!
Jake's in town! Let's start the ball!


903
02:00:11.643 --> 02:00:13.076
Mal.

904
02:00:15.147 --> 02:00:18.548
I'm glad you're here. I've been watching
her, but she needs a doctor.


905
02:00:23.188 --> 02:00:24.621
Yeah.

906
02:00:53.151 --> 02:00:55.312
Looking for this?

907
02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.125
It's all right.
I'm here now.


908
02:05:26.057 --> 02:05:28.048
What a waste.

909
02:05:29.761 --> 02:05:32.628
This could've been such a sweet deal
for us.


910
02:05:34.365 --> 02:05:36.663
Yeah.

911
02:05:36.734 --> 02:05:38.292
Bad luck.

912
02:05:46.911 --> 02:05:48.469
Good-bye, Cobb.

913
02:05:50.482 --> 02:05:52.382
Good-bye, Paden.

914
02:06:47.105 --> 02:06:48.538
To California.

915
02:06:57.815 --> 02:07:00.375
- Got to go.
- Right.


916
02:07:10.795 --> 02:07:13.229
You take care of yourself,
you hear?


917
02:07:14.098 --> 02:07:15.565
You, too.

918
02:07:20.872 --> 02:07:23.033
Jake, Paden.

919
02:07:26.311 --> 02:07:28.245
Come on, Molly.

920
02:07:47.265 --> 02:07:50.098
Weren't you gonna come out
and say good-bye?


921
02:07:50.168 --> 02:07:52.830
I already did that.

922
02:07:52.904 --> 02:07:55.134
You know where I'll be.

923
02:07:56.074 --> 02:07:57.507
Yeah.

924
02:08:16.494 --> 02:08:17.927
So long, Paden.

925
02:08:17.996 --> 02:08:20.692
So long, Jake.

926
02:08:26.404 --> 02:08:28.804
You might make a farmer yet.

927
02:08:29.474 --> 02:08:32.443
I got a job.

928
02:08:42.286 --> 02:08:44.311
Let's get goin'.

929
02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:57.698
Take care of your folks.

930
02:08:57.769 --> 02:08:59.202
I will.

931
02:09:07.011 --> 02:09:08.979
We'll be back!

932
02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:13.054
