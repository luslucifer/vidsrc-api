1
00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:37.810
Panama.

2
00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:40.547
Panama?

3
00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:42.051
Best I could do, Andrew...

4
00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.520
...in the circumstances,
given your sins.


5
00:00:45.992 --> 00:00:47.755
They were baying for blood.

6
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.425
I argued your case.

7
00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:55.934
"For his long service,
his fine brain in the balance...


8
00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:57.728
...against the gambling debts...

9
00:00:57.938 --> 00:01:01.533
...the blown cover and the wives."

10
00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:03.903
The wives.

11
00:01:04.678 --> 00:01:07.238
So, a last chance.

12
00:01:07.447 --> 00:01:08.505
Panama.

13
00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:10.943
Keep the head down?

14
00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:13.143
Serve out my time?

15
00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:15.685
Not quite, Andrew.
We do have interests:


16
00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:19.517
The canal, vital artery.
There is work to be done.


17
00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.096
But for God's sake,
be careful out there, man.


18
00:01:25.298 --> 00:01:27.823
There's a nasty web
of money-laundering...


19
00:01:28.034 --> 00:01:30.059
...drug trafficking and corruption.

20
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:32.031
Really?

21
00:01:33.173 --> 00:01:36.199
<i>There are only 200
resident Brits in Panama.</i>


22
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.474
<i>But you can surely ferret
out one or two...</i>


23
00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.445
<i>... who can gain you access
to the corridors of power.</i>


24
00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:01.766
Look, look!
The Bridge of the Americas.


25
00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:07.630
<i>You know, ever since
the canal cut them in half...</i>


26
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:10.139
<i>... this bridge is now the only link...</i>

27
00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:13.244
<i>... between North and South America.</i>

28
00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:15.911
<i>Think about it!</i>

29
00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:50.141
<i>The way I see it,
we all have a dream of ourselves...</i>


30
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:53.149
...that we could be more than we are.

31
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.115
Well, Pendel and Braithwaite are here
to help you realize that dream...


32
00:02:57.357 --> 00:02:59.518
...in the Savile Row tradition.

33
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.421
Let's try this one now.

34
00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:08.961
Oh, yeah, I guess this is kind of...

35
00:03:09.603 --> 00:03:13.471
I thought you'd like that one, sir.
Mr. Connery's choice.


36
00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:17.040
As soon as I saw you I thought,
"Who does he remind me of?"


37
00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:21.647
And that's it. In the build too.
Golfer's shoulders.


38
00:04:56.743 --> 00:04:58.768
How about that, Uncle Benny?

39
00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.642
<i>You've got the fluence, Harry.
I've always said it, and you have.</i>


40
00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.943
<i>You're the outright best tailor
in the world. Bar none.</i>


41
00:05:06.152 --> 00:05:09.144
<i>Steady on, Uncle Benny, steady on.</i>

42
00:05:13.727 --> 00:05:15.422
Harry, come on.

43
00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:17.720
- I'm coming.
- All right.


44
00:05:18.164 --> 00:05:21.600
All right, you get in first, Sarah.
Don't forget your belt.


45
00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:22.995
- Sarah.
- I'm trying!


46
00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:24.192
Mark.

47
00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:30.236
Okay. Bye-bye.

48
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.460
George, George, 
I saw you yesterday.

49
00:05:56.903 --> 00:05:59.701
All right, here you go then.
How's your old lady?


50
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.209
Sarah, Sarah!

51
00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:13.784
Hi, Bella.

52
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.313
Dad, give me a quarter.

53
00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:19.147
Have you learnt your poem?

54
00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:22.691
<i>Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forest of the night</i>


55
00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:40.979
<i>- See you, Dad.
- Shalom.</i>


56
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:42.409
<i>Shalom.</i>

57
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.262
Look at your hair!

58
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:06.371
<i>Oh, what immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful cemetery</i>


59
00:07:06.573 --> 00:07:08.837
No, "symmetry." Symmetry.

60
00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:11.567
I still don't know what it means.

61
00:07:15.882 --> 00:07:18.248
- Did you see the news last night?
- Yes, I did.


62
00:07:18.451 --> 00:07:20.646
Your people want their canal back.

63
00:07:20.854 --> 00:07:24.312
Not my people, Ernesto.
They're rabid, right-wing senators.


64
00:07:24.524 --> 00:07:26.458
- Do you know what they are?
- Say it.


65
00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:28.126
Assholes.

66
00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:53.646
You see?

67
00:07:53.853 --> 00:07:55.286
Turn around.

68
00:07:57.223 --> 00:07:58.747
It's only a tad, Ramon.

69
00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:02.891
If you want to look good in my suit,
lose weight and grow a foot.


70
00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:05.621
Come to the shop.
We can ease it a little.


71
00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:07.060
Okay.

72
00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:11.828
So, what are we gonna do
about the overdraft, Harry?


73
00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:13.836
You tell me, Ramon.

74
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.134
You have to think
about selling the farm, Harry.


75
00:08:17.343 --> 00:08:18.708
Sell it?

76
00:08:19.345 --> 00:08:21.108
It's a gold mine, Ramon.

77
00:08:21.314 --> 00:08:25.683
<i>Angelo's turning it around. He's a
very good man, Ramon. Dedicated.</i>


78
00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:27.982
I hear you got a water problem.

79
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:30.887
<i>Did have, Ramon, did have.
I put that right.</i>


80
00:08:31.124 --> 00:08:32.955
<i>Now, it flows like...</i>

81
00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.490
Water.

82
00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:36.053
Exactly, Ramon.

83
00:08:36.696 --> 00:08:39.859
Maybe you shouldn't have
bought it, eh?


84
00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:43.229
On your advice, Ramon. Fair's fair.

85
00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:47.238
The bank wishes to see
a substantial reduction...


86
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.240
...on the outstanding sum
by the end of next month.


87
00:08:51.444 --> 00:08:52.968
Otherwise...

88
00:08:54.013 --> 00:08:55.378
...we have to call it in.

89
00:08:55.582 --> 00:08:56.571
What?

90
00:08:56.783 --> 00:08:57.977
The whole lot?

91
00:08:58.184 --> 00:09:00.243
But of course the whole lot.

92
00:09:02.422 --> 00:09:06.791
You are my friend. I hate
to do this, but my hands are tied.


93
00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:08.051
What can I say?

94
00:09:08.828 --> 00:09:12.787
What am I going to tell Louisa?
I bought it with her inheritance.


95
00:09:13.032 --> 00:09:15.933
Well, you're the storyteller, Harry.

96
00:09:31.184 --> 00:09:32.776
You're an angel.

97
00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:41.517
Someone to see you.

98
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:42.728
Oh, yes? Who?

99
00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:44.793
New customer, he say.

100
00:09:45.098 --> 00:09:47.965
Hi. Name's Osnard.

101
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:50.660
I phoned.

102
00:09:51.137 --> 00:09:53.435
Mr. Osnard. Harry Pendel.

103
00:09:54.107 --> 00:09:55.904
Very happy to meet you, sir.

104
00:09:56.709 --> 00:09:59.610
No offense, but I was hoping
to see Mr. Braithwaite.


105
00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:02.647
No chance of that,
I'm sorry to say, sir.


106
00:10:02.849 --> 00:10:06.080
My late partner has been dead
and gone these many years.


107
00:10:06.286 --> 00:10:09.881
Though his exacting standards
are very much alive and well.


108
00:10:10.123 --> 00:10:11.681
Glad to hear that.

109
00:10:12.859 --> 00:10:15.123
He dressed my father, you know.

110
00:10:15.328 --> 00:10:17.262
Back in his Savile Row days.

111
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.131
Well, I never! Now that's a first,
I don't mind admitting.


112
00:10:21.334 --> 00:10:23.894
Father to son,
Savile Row to Panama City.


113
00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:26.867
- Did you hear that?
- I thought you'd be surprised.


114
00:10:27.073 --> 00:10:28.802
Surprised, sir, and delighted.

115
00:10:29.008 --> 00:10:31.738
Marta, put Mr. Osnard down
as an old customer.


116
00:10:31.944 --> 00:10:34.879
Arthur Braithwaite made
for his father.


117
00:10:35.081 --> 00:10:37.811
Now, if you'd care
to come this way, Mr. Osnard.


118
00:10:39.252 --> 00:10:40.981
What in hell happened to her?

119
00:10:41.954 --> 00:10:45.651
In the bad old days, would that be?
Noriega's time?


120
00:10:45.892 --> 00:10:47.484
Rough justice meted out?

121
00:10:48.728 --> 00:10:51.322
- Lf you'd care to take a seat, sir.
- Thank you.


122
00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:56.901
We call this The Club Room. Many of
our gentlemen spend time here...


123
00:10:57.103 --> 00:10:59.162
...in the lunch hour
and at the day's end.


124
00:10:59.372 --> 00:11:00.600
And why not?

125
00:11:00.807 --> 00:11:03.105
What did you have in mind,
sir, exactly?


126
00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:06.745
I thought I'd start with a few
lounge suits. See how they go.


127
00:11:06.946 --> 00:11:11.645
After that, well, the "full monty,"
as old Braithwaite used to say.


128
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:13.614
I see. Very good, sir.

129
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.756
Pity the expression's been hijacked.
Means quite the other thing now.


130
00:11:17.957 --> 00:11:20.755
- So they tell me, sir.
- Bollock naked, in fact.


131
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.894
- Quite so, sir.
- Money's no problem.


132
00:11:23.863 --> 00:11:26.764
Take a look at these, sir.
See what takes your fancy.


133
00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:30.531
They're all the right weight
for this diabolical climate.


134
00:11:30.737 --> 00:11:33.672
Seven ounces of nicely breathing,
finest worsted.


135
00:11:33.873 --> 00:11:36.307
About all a man could
or should put up with.


136
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:39.410
How about this one?
Alpaca, am I right?


137
00:11:39.612 --> 00:11:41.273
- Very good, sir.
- Perfect.


138
00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:43.472
And exactly what I should've picked.

139
00:11:43.683 --> 00:11:45.378
Given that money's no object?

140
00:11:47.687 --> 00:11:51.145
- So, what's next?
- Ah! The sun!


141
00:11:51.357 --> 00:11:53.416
Vital statistics.
Please step this way.


142
00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:55.024
Certainly.

143
00:11:55.294 --> 00:11:58.627
If I could ask you to slip off
your jacket. Thank you, sir.


144
00:12:12.078 --> 00:12:14.842
You were Noriega's tailor,
weren't you, in his time?


145
00:12:15.381 --> 00:12:17.508
I'm sorry, sir, is that a problem?

146
00:12:17.717 --> 00:12:21.551
Not necessarily.
Smelly little bugger, was he?


147
00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:24.022
If I may, sir.

148
00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:26.919
Forty.

149
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.718
And the waist...

150
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:30.394
What's the damage?

151
00:12:30.596 --> 00:12:32.860
A very creditable 34-plus.

152
00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:34.166
Plus what?

153
00:12:34.634 --> 00:12:36.465
Plus lunch, put it that way, sir.

154
00:12:37.804 --> 00:12:39.101
Very good.

155
00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:42.900
Do you ever miss it?
The old country? Savile Row?


156
00:12:44.143 --> 00:12:46.543
The Row. Well, now...

157
00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:48.270
...I do and I don't.

158
00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:51.481
Nothing beats it,
but when I was there...


159
00:12:51.684 --> 00:12:55.347
...I always felt very much
in old Arthur Braithwaite's shadow.


160
00:12:55.788 --> 00:12:59.952
Though it was Arthur Braithwaite
who encouraged me to spread my wings.


161
00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:04.061
- Good old boy, Arthur, was he?
- One of the old school, sir.


162
00:13:07.467 --> 00:13:08.991
Now, if I might...

163
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.901
Very good, sir.

164
00:13:12.638 --> 00:13:14.071
Do we dress right or left?

165
00:13:14.273 --> 00:13:17.936
Most gentlemen favor left these days.
Don't think it's political.


166
00:13:18.144 --> 00:13:22.137
Never know where the bloody thing is.
Bobs about like a windsock.


167
00:13:22.849 --> 00:13:24.817
- You were saying?
- Saying, sir?


168
00:13:25.017 --> 00:13:28.919
Braithwaite. Telling you
to spread your wings.


169
00:13:29.355 --> 00:13:32.347
Yes, of course.
I remember it like yesterday.


170
00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:36.187
I was cutting a nice muted check
hacking jacket for Lord Braeburn.


171
00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:38.989
Finest mohair, dash of cashmere.

172
00:13:39.432 --> 00:13:42.458
I looked up and he was looking
at me from the doorway.


173
00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:44.599
Arthur Braithwaite, that is.

174
00:13:44.804 --> 00:13:47.364
He was a big man, imposing.

175
00:13:47.573 --> 00:13:50.303
He had a presence.
It's hard to put it into words.


176
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.307
- It was the moustache.
- Moustache?


177
00:13:52.512 --> 00:13:54.844
Bloody great bushy job,
soup all over it.


178
00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:59.144
- There was no moustache in my day.
- I can see it now. Bright brown.


179
00:13:59.352 --> 00:14:02.753
I think we're being rumbled, Harry.
Admit nothing. Deny all.


180
00:14:02.955 --> 00:14:04.946
I think your memory's playing tricks.

181
00:14:05.157 --> 00:14:09.355
You're thinking of another man and
awarding his moustache to Braithwaite.


182
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.395
Go on.

183
00:14:12.598 --> 00:14:16.728
"Harry," he says to me,
"I think you've earned your spurs.


184
00:14:16.936 --> 00:14:19.097
How would you feel
about taking my name...


185
00:14:19.305 --> 00:14:21.773
...and tradition to the New World?

186
00:14:21.974 --> 00:14:24.340
I'm talking about a full partnership."

187
00:14:24.544 --> 00:14:27.377
I don't mind saying,
there were tears in my eyes.


188
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.878
You've practically got tears in mine.

189
00:14:30.383 --> 00:14:31.475
Thank you, sir.

190
00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:35.584
I've never heard such a load
of bullshit in my life.


191
00:14:38.224 --> 00:14:39.953
Come and sit down, Harry.

192
00:14:40.326 --> 00:14:41.486
It's all right.

193
00:14:41.794 --> 00:14:43.989
I'm your fairy godmother.

194
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:48.122
The thing is, Harry,
I know who you are.


195
00:14:48.634 --> 00:14:51.603
More accurately,
I know who you aren't.


196
00:14:51.804 --> 00:14:55.001
- I don't know what you're saying.
- It's all right. Relax.


197
00:14:55.207 --> 00:14:58.734
Because I know. 
You're 906017 Pendel.

198
00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:01.345
Six years for arson,
served two and a half.


199
00:15:01.547 --> 00:15:05.506
Learnt your tailoring in the slammer.
Insurance scam, wasn't it?


200
00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:08.152
Set fire to a warehouse
for your Uncle Benny.


201
00:15:08.354 --> 00:15:10.845
They caught you
with the matches in your hand.


202
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.887
You've never been near Savile Row.

203
00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:14.922
Braithwaite is your Uncle Benny...

204
00:15:15.127 --> 00:15:18.722
...raised from the dead, born again
and given a size-nine halo.


205
00:15:22.635 --> 00:15:26.469
Upon release, you did a runner to
Panama with your Uncle Benny's help.


206
00:15:26.672 --> 00:15:28.537
Built up a fine business.

207
00:15:28.741 --> 00:15:32.768
Married the daughter of an American
canal engineer. Well-respected man.


208
00:15:33.312 --> 00:15:36.713
But you owe the bank 50,000,
thanks to that farm.


209
00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:39.407
You've put in the shop
and the house as collateral.


210
00:15:39.619 --> 00:15:42.179
Not wise, Harry. 
Not wise at all.

211
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:45.953
I can almost hear the creditors
banging on the door.


212
00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:47.417
Who are you?

213
00:15:47.793 --> 00:15:49.385
I'm Andy Osnard.

214
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:52.894
New boy at the British Embassy,
finding my way around town.


215
00:16:01.107 --> 00:16:03.041
Strictly between us...

216
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:05.800
...I'm MI.6's man in Panama.

217
00:16:06.178 --> 00:16:09.238
It's dark and Ionely work,
like oral sex.


218
00:16:09.448 --> 00:16:11.439
But someone has to do it, Harry.

219
00:16:12.818 --> 00:16:16.151
I'm opening up a little network.
Keeping an eye on the canal.


220
00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:18.819
So, what's that got to do with me?

221
00:16:19.058 --> 00:16:21.117
What gives you
the right to come here...


222
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.989
...sandbag me with my past
after I've paid my debt to society?


223
00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:27.962
Cool down. I'm bonus.

224
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:31.297
Okay.

225
00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:32.593
What do you want?

226
00:16:33.706 --> 00:16:35.037
Your memory.

227
00:16:35.307 --> 00:16:36.706
Your "rock of eye."

228
00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:40.902
Isn't that the expression? Things you
know and don't even know you know.


229
00:16:41.113 --> 00:16:43.172
Highest prices paid.

230
00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:47.979
Get out. Now.

231
00:16:48.354 --> 00:16:49.548
Off.

232
00:16:49.855 --> 00:16:53.120
Don't be a cunt, Harry.
We're made for each other.


233
00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:56.453
You have debts, I have money.
Where's your patriotism?


234
00:16:56.729 --> 00:16:59.459
I had it out in prison,
without an anesthetic.


235
00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:09.872
There's five grand there.
Say it's on account of the suits.


236
00:17:10.076 --> 00:17:14.274
Call it "entertainment expenses,"
anything you like, really.


237
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.607
I want us to get on, Harry.

238
00:17:17.149 --> 00:17:18.207
Go on.

239
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:23.912
Show me around, is all.

240
00:17:26.225 --> 00:17:27.351
Do I have a choice?

241
00:17:27.593 --> 00:17:29.618
Oh, don't put it like that.

242
00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:33.356
It's a game. Let's have some fun, eh?

243
00:17:39.472 --> 00:17:40.530
Hi.

244
00:17:41.273 --> 00:17:43.138
No, nothing much.

245
00:17:44.243 --> 00:17:47.144
Well, sure, if you feel you have to.

246
00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:51.774
- Why not just bring him home?
- I think I'll take him to the club.


247
00:17:52.752 --> 00:17:55.050
Not sure. He's an odd chap.

248
00:17:56.155 --> 00:17:57.520
No, nothing's wrong.

249
00:17:57.857 --> 00:17:59.825
Your voice sounds funny.

250
00:18:04.697 --> 00:18:06.927
He called it a windsock?

251
00:18:18.544 --> 00:18:21.308
Se? Or. Good evening, Mr. Pendel.

252
00:18:22.548 --> 00:18:26.006
- Must have cost a lot to get in here.
- Had to be done.


253
00:18:26.218 --> 00:18:29.278
Hey, Harry, what about my blazer?

254
00:18:29.555 --> 00:18:33.321
Drop by on Tuesday, Luis.
It'll be ready to try on.


255
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.492
Blazers, they all want blazers.

256
00:18:36.695 --> 00:18:38.322
You dress everyone here?

257
00:18:38.531 --> 00:18:39.828
Just about, Andy.

258
00:18:40.032 --> 00:18:41.556
So who are "they"?

259
00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:43.428
Who gets to join?

260
00:18:43.636 --> 00:18:47.231
Basically, 30 ruling families,
their lawyers and their bankers.


261
00:18:47.439 --> 00:18:49.464
And their tailors, I take it.

262
00:18:50.242 --> 00:18:53.006
When the Americans took out
Noriega, I said to myself:


263
00:18:53.212 --> 00:18:57.046
"Harry, they got Ali Baba,
but they missed the 40 thieves."


264
00:18:57.483 --> 00:18:58.745
Well, here they are.

265
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:00.851
So fill me in.

266
00:19:01.053 --> 00:19:03.817
Nobody ever loses
their reputation in Panama.


267
00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:07.287
They hang it in the closet
for a bit to get its shape back.


268
00:19:07.526 --> 00:19:10.461
When they put it on again,
it's as good as new.


269
00:19:11.397 --> 00:19:13.365
On the dance floor, Rafi Domingo.

270
00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:16.227
Shipping and drugs.

271
00:19:17.736 --> 00:19:19.363
I could fuck that very easily.

272
00:19:22.908 --> 00:19:25.968
- Wouldn't be any pain at all.
- A lot have, Andy.


273
00:19:26.178 --> 00:19:28.169
A lot wish they had, who haven't...

274
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.747
...and one or two have,
who wish they hadn't.


275
00:19:35.921 --> 00:19:37.786
Who are those charmers just come in?

276
00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.157
Government ministers
and the money boys who own them.


277
00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:45.228
At the table, bunch of gentlemen
from the loyal opposition.


278
00:19:45.431 --> 00:19:47.797
They come much cheaper, naturally.

279
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.405
Welcome to Panama.

280
00:19:57.243 --> 00:19:59.973
A Casablanca without heroes.

281
00:20:00.212 --> 00:20:01.975
You are pure gold, Harry.

282
00:20:02.314 --> 00:20:03.508
Hey!

283
00:20:03.716 --> 00:20:06.150
Harry!

284
00:20:07.386 --> 00:20:08.546
Mickie.

285
00:20:11.924 --> 00:20:12.891
Harry.

286
00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:16.356
Mickie, I think you're
a touch refreshed!


287
00:20:16.662 --> 00:20:18.095
Please, come and sit down.

288
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.764
"A man should stand on his feet."

289
00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:23.357
Anyone remember that?!

290
00:20:26.005 --> 00:20:27.632
Isn't that the next bit?

291
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.543
"Never on our knees." Right.
Or on our asses.


292
00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:36.875
- So who the fuck are you, my friend?
- I'd like you to meet Andy Osnard.


293
00:20:37.082 --> 00:20:38.515
British Embassy.

294
00:20:38.717 --> 00:20:41.015
Mickie really is a genuine hero, Andy.

295
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.383
One of the few with the guts
to stand up to you-know-who.


296
00:20:44.623 --> 00:20:47.148
Mickie, please sit down.
People are staring.


297
00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:50.123
I don't give a fuck about these fucks.

298
00:20:50.329 --> 00:20:54.060
These are the fucks who kept
that fuck Noriega in power.


299
00:20:54.266 --> 00:20:56.757
You know what I would do...
Mr. Andy, right?


300
00:20:56.969 --> 00:20:59.460
You know what I would do
if I was president?


301
00:20:59.672 --> 00:21:02.937
- What?
- I'd kill every fuck in this room.


302
00:21:03.142 --> 00:21:04.439
All of us.

303
00:21:04.643 --> 00:21:07.305
Look at us. Look at us!

304
00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:12.816
We got everything
God needed to make paradise.


305
00:21:13.018 --> 00:21:14.076
And what do we do?

306
00:21:14.286 --> 00:21:16.345
We sell each other.

307
00:21:16.555 --> 00:21:19.149
We sell our country.
We sell it all away!


308
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:21.291
Harry, you take him for a walk.

309
00:21:21.493 --> 00:21:23.358
Look at these people, eh!

310
00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:25.260
Look at these people.

311
00:21:25.497 --> 00:21:29.058
You sold your souls,
you don't even know it. Stupid!


312
00:21:30.602 --> 00:21:34.470
If you make any more trouble,
I will never cut you another suit.


313
00:21:36.642 --> 00:21:39.577
Come on. I'll take you home.

314
00:21:40.546 --> 00:21:42.810
Sorry. He's an old friend,
you know.


315
00:21:45.551 --> 00:21:46.848
Hello, Harry.

316
00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:48.950
<i>Se? Or Delgado. 
Buenos noches.</i>

317
00:21:49.154 --> 00:21:51.622
Canal Commissioner?
He as clean as they say?


318
00:21:51.857 --> 00:21:53.722
Well, my wife thinks so.

319
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.428
Come on, Mickie, what is this?

320
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.669
Come on, Mickie.

321
00:23:13.872 --> 00:23:16.033
You're a good man, Harry.

322
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:20.177
The only good men left in Panama City
are you and me.


323
00:23:20.379 --> 00:23:23.644
- That's all. You and me.
- Okay, in you go. Come on.


324
00:23:26.952 --> 00:23:29.443
He has heart, Mr. Cool.

325
00:23:29.655 --> 00:23:30.644
Heart.

326
00:23:30.889 --> 00:23:33.119
Come on, now. Call it a night.

327
00:23:47.473 --> 00:23:49.134
So, what's the story with him?

328
00:23:49.908 --> 00:23:51.102
Mickie?

329
00:23:52.478 --> 00:23:54.810
He was my first customer.

330
00:23:55.013 --> 00:23:56.571
Best
-Iooking man in Panama.

331
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:58.908
A god.

332
00:23:59.852 --> 00:24:02.616
Till Noriega threw him
into prison to shut him up.


333
00:24:03.088 --> 00:24:04.885
Didn't bloody well work, did it?

334
00:24:07.392 --> 00:24:10.020
There's more to Mickie Abraxas
than meets the eye.


335
00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:12.429
Oh, I'm sure there is.

336
00:24:13.398 --> 00:24:16.299
My people don't care
about the glorious past exploits...


337
00:24:16.502 --> 00:24:18.595
...of some shagged-out old wino.

338
00:24:18.804 --> 00:24:22.001
They want the real stuff.
Today's men.


339
00:24:22.608 --> 00:24:24.303
Tomorrow's, not yesterday's.

340
00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:28.011
We're not a fucking charity
for losers.


341
00:24:30.883 --> 00:24:33.113
I hope I haven't made
a mistake with you.


342
00:24:41.326 --> 00:24:43.920
Don't underestimate Mickie Abraxas.

343
00:24:44.163 --> 00:24:45.630
So?

344
00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:48.356
What if I was to tell you
he's still at it?


345
00:24:49.501 --> 00:24:51.264
At what, exactly?

346
00:24:51.637 --> 00:24:53.264
He's still in there.

347
00:24:53.906 --> 00:24:55.464
The Silent Opposition.

348
00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:58.037
The "Silent Opposition"?

349
00:24:58.243 --> 00:25:01.303
He's never lost touch
with ordinary, decent people.


350
00:25:01.513 --> 00:25:03.105
Deprived people.

351
00:25:03.749 --> 00:25:07.185
People who are tired
of the corruption, the greed.


352
00:25:07.719 --> 00:25:09.880
Do you know what the poor call those?

353
00:25:12.624 --> 00:25:14.148
"The Cocaine Towers."

354
00:25:14.393 --> 00:25:16.258
And our 85 banks?

355
00:25:16.461 --> 00:25:17.985
"The launderettes."

356
00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:19.989
Can we buy him?

357
00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:22.224
Mickie? Never.

358
00:25:23.936 --> 00:25:27.303
But he might allow you
to contribute to the cause.


359
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.544
Uncle Benny, I fill up. I can't stop.
I get the wind in my ears.


360
00:25:39.751 --> 00:25:42.777
You've got the fluence in full flow
and the rock of eye.


361
00:25:42.988 --> 00:25:46.549
But it's a curse
as well as a blessing.


362
00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:04.899
How'd it go?

363
00:26:09.615 --> 00:26:12.049
Fine. I think.

364
00:26:12.251 --> 00:26:13.479
Hey...

365
00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.344
...get in here.

366
00:26:27.466 --> 00:26:28.694
Hi.

367
00:26:29.701 --> 00:26:31.032
I missed you.

368
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.871
Wait, I'll take my socks off.

369
00:26:36.275 --> 00:26:38.140
I may be some time.

370
00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.771
Mr. Osnard.

371
00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:19.210
Ah, Andrew Osnard.

372
00:27:19.418 --> 00:27:22.854
Nigel Stormont. 
Francesca Deane.

373
00:27:23.055 --> 00:27:24.716
- Hello.
- Welcome to Panama.


374
00:27:24.956 --> 00:27:26.446
Thank you, ambassador.

375
00:27:26.692 --> 00:27:27.659
Please.

376
00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:31.852
I gather you've been having
a look round already...


377
00:27:32.097 --> 00:27:33.064
...quite extensively.

378
00:27:33.265 --> 00:27:35.256
Yes, indeed. Great spot.

379
00:27:35.467 --> 00:27:36.695
Right up my street.

380
00:27:36.902 --> 00:27:41.703
And how should we describe your
street, Andrew...


381
00:27:41.907 --> 00:27:43.534
...to the curious?

382
00:27:44.142 --> 00:27:46.542
I usually say
I'm in information technology.


383
00:27:46.745 --> 00:27:49.441
Oh, you're one of them.

384
00:27:49.648 --> 00:27:50.808
"A friend."

385
00:27:51.216 --> 00:27:54.344
That's right. I'm a friend.

386
00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.212
Oh, my dear, but it's a huge secret.

387
00:27:58.423 --> 00:28:00.983
Or it was, until Osnard blubbed it.

388
00:28:01.226 --> 00:28:04.457
I mean, I'm barely allowed to know it.

389
00:28:04.663 --> 00:28:07.427
Not the Osnard got
drummed out of Madrid?


390
00:28:07.699 --> 00:28:09.257
Foreign minister's wife, wasn't it?

391
00:28:10.302 --> 00:28:13.499
Not his wife. Mistress.

392
00:28:13.705 --> 00:28:15.969
There are some things
I won't do for England.


393
00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:19.142
Got your picture in the paper,
didn't it?


394
00:28:19.344 --> 00:28:21.869
Hence my posting to Panama.
What was your crime?


395
00:28:23.615 --> 00:28:24.582
Coffee?

396
00:28:24.783 --> 00:28:25.841
Thank you.

397
00:28:26.051 --> 00:28:27.575
Help yourself.

398
00:28:27.886 --> 00:28:31.117
Is it just exile, or do you
have a purpose here?


399
00:28:32.891 --> 00:28:33.983
Sure.

400
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.352
The boys at home are concerned that
the world's biggest trade gateway...


401
00:28:38.597 --> 00:28:40.758
...doesn't fall into
the wrong hands...


402
00:28:43.635 --> 00:28:45.830
...now that it's in the wrong hands.

403
00:28:46.805 --> 00:28:49.899
Forgive me.
Don't want to seem presumptuous...


404
00:28:50.108 --> 00:28:52.633
...but I doubt you'll find
anything they don't know...


405
00:28:52.844 --> 00:28:55.438
...from our regular embassy briefings.

406
00:28:58.717 --> 00:29:00.947
Know about the Silent Opposition?

407
00:29:05.157 --> 00:29:06.556
There you go.

408
00:29:10.262 --> 00:29:12.025
You're a fast worker.

409
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.427
See something worth having,
go after it.


410
00:29:15.634 --> 00:29:18.102
May I ask at what point we here
at the embassy...


411
00:29:18.303 --> 00:29:20.271
...will get sight of your product?

412
00:29:21.173 --> 00:29:24.142
My boss says no local sharing unless
he gives the nod...


413
00:29:24.342 --> 00:29:27.140
...but I'm not really bothered
about that.


414
00:29:27.879 --> 00:29:30.712
Say, the four of us in this room?

415
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.841
I'd have no problem with that.

416
00:29:34.953 --> 00:29:39.117
Well, all that seems very
satisfactory. Nigel?


417
00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:41.391
Francesca?

418
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.650
Good to have you with us, Andrew.

419
00:29:44.095 --> 00:29:45.790
Good to be here.

420
00:29:46.231 --> 00:29:48.893
Francesca will show you
to your office.


421
00:29:49.801 --> 00:29:50.961
Yes.

422
00:29:57.142 --> 00:29:59.633
It's a bit on the poky side,
I'm afraid.


423
00:29:59.878 --> 00:30:02.278
Bit on the poky side's fine with me.

424
00:30:02.481 --> 00:30:04.745
We thought you'd be out
and about a lot.


425
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.315
Here we are.

426
00:30:18.797 --> 00:30:20.492
What are you listening to?

427
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:25.258
The sea.

428
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.171
Bloody thing's been sitting in
the warehouse all its life.


429
00:30:36.648 --> 00:30:38.775
Stuck on one combo.

430
00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:42.646
Tumblers all shot.

431
00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:49.456
Gotcha!

432
00:30:54.065 --> 00:30:57.193
Are you quite sure that it
was locked in the first place?


433
00:31:01.806 --> 00:31:05.902
I'm staying at the Gamboa Rain Forest
Resort till the apartment's ready.


434
00:31:06.111 --> 00:31:07.669
Come out on Sunday.

435
00:31:07.879 --> 00:31:11.474
Spot of lunch. 
Swim in the lake.

436
00:31:13.318 --> 00:31:14.512
See how it goes.

437
00:31:16.321 --> 00:31:18.516
I think I'm busy on Sunday.

438
00:31:18.757 --> 00:31:20.224
You're right.

439
00:31:21.293 --> 00:31:22.726
It was open.

440
00:31:25.463 --> 00:31:27.363
Just tight from lack of use.

441
00:31:32.571 --> 00:31:34.766
The ambassador's asked me
to brief you...


442
00:31:34.973 --> 00:31:37.533
...in case there's anything you
don't already know.


443
00:31:44.349 --> 00:31:48.410
Noriega formed these so-called
"Dignity Battalions."


444
00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.178
Dingbats.

445
00:31:50.388 --> 00:31:55.416
They were to beat the dignity out of
anyone remotely critical of Noriega.


446
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:59.921
It was Dr. Frankenstein,
George Bush...


447
00:32:00.131 --> 00:32:02.759
...who created this monster...

448
00:32:02.968 --> 00:32:04.697
...when he was head of the CIA.

449
00:32:04.903 --> 00:32:06.700
And when Noriega's...

450
00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:10.807
...drug running and brutality
got too much, even for the CIA...


451
00:32:11.009 --> 00:32:15.844
...it was George, now President Bush,
who decided to take him out.


452
00:32:16.715 --> 00:32:18.046
And just to make sure...

453
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.976
...they fire-bombed a big chunk
of the old city.


454
00:32:24.823 --> 00:32:28.020
Sadly, that's where
the anti-Noriega rebels were.


455
00:32:28.259 --> 00:32:31.387
The handful that Noriega hadn't
banged up already.


456
00:32:32.397 --> 00:32:36.561
So no more opposition,
silent or otherwise.


457
00:32:37.168 --> 00:32:38.396
Burnt...

458
00:32:39.204 --> 00:32:40.796
...scattered...

459
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.873
...fled.

460
00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:50.346
Or risen again from the ashes.

461
00:33:02.594 --> 00:33:06.462
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody, here we go.


462
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.539
Sorry.

463
00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:33.323
Mickie!

464
00:33:34.693 --> 00:33:36.024
Come in.

465
00:33:50.341 --> 00:33:54.437
Sorry about the other night.
I'm going through a bad patch.


466
00:33:54.646 --> 00:33:58.412
Is it money, Mickie? Is it?
Maybe I can help.


467
00:34:00.719 --> 00:34:01.913
You?

468
00:34:03.354 --> 00:34:05.914
You got worse debts than me.

469
00:34:06.958 --> 00:34:09.552
Mr. Farmer, huh?

470
00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:17.259
Do you still keep in touch,
you know...


471
00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.563
...with any of the students,
the fighters, from the old days?


472
00:34:20.772 --> 00:34:25.368
No, they're all lawyers now. Bankers.

473
00:34:26.277 --> 00:34:29.474
Haven't you heard?
We got a democracy.


474
00:34:29.681 --> 00:34:32.275
There's still a lot to fight for,
Mickie.


475
00:34:33.718 --> 00:34:36.346
I haven't got the stomach for it.

476
00:34:36.554 --> 00:34:39.614
I get the shakes
when I see a cop.

477
00:34:41.259 --> 00:34:44.251
Unless I'm drunk,
and then I want to hit him.


478
00:34:44.696 --> 00:34:46.687
Either way...

479
00:34:47.298 --> 00:34:49.391
What about Marta's people?

480
00:34:49.934 --> 00:34:51.561
They loved you.

481
00:34:52.103 --> 00:34:53.400
They looked up to you.

482
00:34:56.808 --> 00:34:59.072
You should give up on me, Harry.

483
00:35:00.145 --> 00:35:01.942
I'm a lost cause.

484
00:35:03.815 --> 00:35:05.544
How much do you owe, Mickie?

485
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.241
Owe to the casino? To you?

486
00:35:08.453 --> 00:35:10.887
All of it. All in. Come on.

487
00:35:13.224 --> 00:35:16.489
Not much change out of 20 grand.

488
00:35:17.295 --> 00:35:18.853
I'll get it for you, Mickie.

489
00:35:19.464 --> 00:35:22.262
And I'm gonna make you a new suit.

490
00:35:22.801 --> 00:35:25.827
A lovely silk and mohair herringbone.

491
00:35:27.405 --> 00:35:28.702
Okay?

492
00:35:28.907 --> 00:35:31.569
Okay. Okay.

493
00:35:43.254 --> 00:35:45.279
- Se? Or Pendel?
- What have I done wrong, Marta?


494
00:35:45.523 --> 00:35:48.390
Nothing. That's the problem.
Look at these accounts.


495
00:35:48.593 --> 00:35:51.153
Your friend Rafi Domingo.
Two months overdue.


496
00:35:51.396 --> 00:35:53.864
Carry it till next month.
He's a good customer.


497
00:35:54.098 --> 00:35:57.158
He's a shit. He made all his
money under Noriega.


498
00:35:57.368 --> 00:35:58.835
I'm going to charge him interest.

499
00:35:59.037 --> 00:36:00.937
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.


500
00:36:01.139 --> 00:36:04.040
You're worried they won't like you
if you make them pay.


501
00:36:04.242 --> 00:36:05.402
It's a tradition.

502
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.908
Gentlemen keep tailors
waiting for money.


503
00:36:08.112 --> 00:36:11.104
Gentlemen? Find me one.

504
00:36:11.549 --> 00:36:15.041
Your Mr. Osnard isn't one,
that's for sure.


505
00:36:15.253 --> 00:36:17.483
- What does he want?
- A suit.


506
00:36:18.089 --> 00:36:19.283
This is me, Harry.

507
00:36:20.124 --> 00:36:22.319
He's looking for information.

508
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.893
Be nice to him. No sulks.
Promise?


509
00:36:26.364 --> 00:36:27.626
He's a devil.

510
00:36:27.832 --> 00:36:29.390
- Who says?
- His eyes say.


511
00:36:29.601 --> 00:36:31.660
I'm just having a bit
of a natter with him.


512
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.737
Don't look at me like that, Marta.
I'm just a tailor.


513
00:36:34.939 --> 00:36:39.137
No, Harry, not just a tailor.
You are a dreamer.


514
00:36:39.344 --> 00:36:42.108
Which is why I have to
watch over you.


515
00:36:43.548 --> 00:36:46.210
Oh, speak of the devil. Mr. Osnard!

516
00:36:46.417 --> 00:36:48.078
How's my suit coming along then?

517
00:36:48.286 --> 00:36:50.618
When I put the shears
into that alpaca, I said:


518
00:36:50.822 --> 00:36:53.552
"Harry, this is gonna be
something special."


519
00:36:54.459 --> 00:36:56.825
A poem, is it?

520
00:36:57.028 --> 00:36:59.189
Great body.

521
00:36:59.564 --> 00:37:02.863
As long as her face is turned away
when you're fucking her.


522
00:37:03.768 --> 00:37:06.566
Marta's decent. She's been
in some very bad places.


523
00:37:06.771 --> 00:37:08.636
Oh, yeah? Such as?

524
00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.672
Here. Under Noriega.

525
00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.179
She stood up when the rest
of us were lying down.


526
00:37:19.384 --> 00:37:21.181
That's why they did her face for her.

527
00:37:21.386 --> 00:37:24.287
Are her sacred causes still intact?

528
00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:26.914
She'd never budge.

529
00:37:27.158 --> 00:37:28.489
Not Marta.

530
00:37:28.693 --> 00:37:30.320
So she's one of them.

531
00:37:30.561 --> 00:37:33.928
- One of who?
- The Silent Opposition.


532
00:37:34.132 --> 00:37:35.292
Absolutely.

533
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.866
- Harry, stop.
- I can't.


534
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:39.536
What is she?

535
00:37:41.606 --> 00:37:43.403
Their chief of ops?

536
00:37:43.975 --> 00:37:45.101
Head spook?

537
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:48.507
- She's more. Much more.
- How much?


538
00:37:48.713 --> 00:37:51.079
You press me too hard, Andy.

539
00:37:52.016 --> 00:37:56.180
Sweetheart, you haven't even
felt me yet.


540
00:37:56.421 --> 00:37:58.412
Think "farm."

541
00:37:58.656 --> 00:38:03.218
She's their Joan of Arc.
Their spiritual leader, bar none.


542
00:38:04.595 --> 00:38:06.586
You're too much, Harry.

543
00:38:07.832 --> 00:38:09.629
Can I have her?

544
00:38:11.102 --> 00:38:13.127
Every penny you give her goes
to the cause...


545
00:38:13.338 --> 00:38:15.772
...without commission
or deduction of any kind.


546
00:38:15.974 --> 00:38:16.963
How much?

547
00:38:17.175 --> 00:38:19.541
For the pulse and soul
of the Silent Opposition?


548
00:38:19.744 --> 00:38:21.439
For Marta?

549
00:38:21.646 --> 00:38:24.114
Mickie needs 20 grand
to activate his units.


550
00:38:24.315 --> 00:38:26.340
Marta should get the same.

551
00:38:26.684 --> 00:38:29.585
- Yeah, I think we can swing that.
- Thank you, Mr. Osnard.


552
00:38:29.787 --> 00:38:33.450
London's tickled pink with this
Silent Opposition of yours.


553
00:38:37.495 --> 00:38:39.463
How is the farm, by the way?

554
00:38:39.664 --> 00:38:41.598
- Don't ask.
- Know who your neighbor is?


555
00:38:41.799 --> 00:38:44.029
The guy who's cutting off access
to your water?


556
00:38:44.235 --> 00:38:46.669
He's not a person,
he's an absentee landlord...


557
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:49.305
...and a corporation in Miami.
And a prick.


558
00:38:51.275 --> 00:38:52.606
You know where he banks?

559
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:55.838
With your chum Ramon.

560
00:38:56.214 --> 00:38:59.775
Not to put too fine a point on it,
he is your chum Ramon.


561
00:38:59.984 --> 00:39:01.952
Well, Ramon owns two thirds.

562
00:39:04.355 --> 00:39:06.550
Mr. X owns the other third.

563
00:39:07.191 --> 00:39:08.556
You know who Mr. X is?

564
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.325
No, I don't know who Mr. X is.

565
00:39:11.996 --> 00:39:14.624
How about your farm-manager chap?

566
00:39:14.899 --> 00:39:16.366
Angelo, isn't it?

567
00:39:44.862 --> 00:39:45.920
<i>No!</i>

568
00:39:47.565 --> 00:39:49.294
<i>Mickie! Marta!</i>

569
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.491
<i>Oh, for the love of God!</i>

570
00:39:57.742 --> 00:39:59.039
<i>Mickie!</i>

571
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:03.007
- Oh, God!
- It's okay.


572
00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:06.641
What time is it?

573
00:40:06.884 --> 00:40:08.545
It's 7:00.

574
00:40:12.924 --> 00:40:15.188
I'll make breakfast.

575
00:40:27.271 --> 00:40:29.603
What happened to your diet, Mom?

576
00:40:29.807 --> 00:40:30.899
I'm in denial.

577
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:32.303
What's denial?

578
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.341
A very big river in Africa.

579
00:40:34.545 --> 00:40:36.479
- Ba-bum!
- Thank you.


580
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:41.011
Mom, this girl in school told me
mothers who work...


581
00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:44.882
...feel guilty about their children.
Why don't you?


582
00:40:45.123 --> 00:40:47.683
Maybe because your father
is such a good mother.


583
00:40:47.925 --> 00:40:51.019
Listen, it's ballet today.
Do not forget your bag.


584
00:40:51.262 --> 00:40:53.059
- Let's go.
- Okay, come on.


585
00:40:58.102 --> 00:40:59.729
Are you seeing
the president today, Dad?


586
00:40:59.937 --> 00:41:02.371
Indeed. So we'd
better get our skates on.


587
00:41:10.815 --> 00:41:12.783
Harold Pendel.

588
00:41:27.231 --> 00:41:29.358
This way, Mr. Pendel.

589
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:37.039
Working. Always working.
He thinks only of Panama.


590
00:41:44.949 --> 00:41:46.541
Se? Or Pendel.

591
00:41:46.918 --> 00:41:48.351
Show me your pass, please.

592
00:41:48.553 --> 00:41:50.453
Marco, you know me.

593
00:41:50.655 --> 00:41:52.987
I made you that
double-breasted mohair.


594
00:41:53.224 --> 00:41:55.692
I'm still waiting for you
to pay me for it.


595
00:41:55.927 --> 00:41:59.988
Through here. He's gonna give you
only five minutes, okay?


596
00:42:06.404 --> 00:42:09.737
Your Excellency.
Welcome back, indeed.


597
00:42:10.575 --> 00:42:13.510
Five capitals in one week,
I think I read.


598
00:42:14.078 --> 00:42:19.209
Paris to Tokyo in seven days.
A record for a world-class statesman.


599
00:42:19.417 --> 00:42:20.748
Pants.

600
00:42:23.454 --> 00:42:26.082
They'll know where Panama is then,
won't they?


601
00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:30.989
We won't be just a wriggly little
worm on the map with a canal, will we?


602
00:42:31.195 --> 00:42:32.662
Vest.

603
00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:38.927
I dispense with
the rear buckle as a rule...


604
00:42:39.136 --> 00:42:41.604
...with your handmade waistcoat,
Excellency.


605
00:42:41.806 --> 00:42:45.401
Too many of my gentlemen report
a discomfort to the lower vertebrae...


606
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.670
...when leaning backward, relishing
a postprandial cigar.


607
00:42:48.879 --> 00:42:49.709
Jacket.

608
00:42:51.515 --> 00:42:54.075
Did we discuss the canal's future
on our travels...


609
00:42:54.285 --> 00:42:55.377
...if I may be so bold?

610
00:42:59.757 --> 00:43:03.659
So you want to know something
about the canal?


611
00:43:03.894 --> 00:43:05.225
If it pleases Your Excellency.

612
00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:07.522
You're halfway up it.

613
00:43:07.732 --> 00:43:09.461
I stand upright.

614
00:43:10.568 --> 00:43:13.162
Okay, just.

615
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:15.339
I bend down...

616
00:43:16.374 --> 00:43:18.934
...my balls are in my ears.
- Very good, sir.


617
00:43:19.143 --> 00:43:21.873
You make your pants too tight,
Mr. Braithwaite.


618
00:43:34.492 --> 00:43:35.959
Harry!

619
00:43:39.797 --> 00:43:41.788
I've got a job.

620
00:43:42.733 --> 00:43:44.564
Shit, shit, shit!

621
00:43:49.373 --> 00:43:50.772
It's upstairs.

622
00:43:52.043 --> 00:43:53.874
No. Thank you.

623
00:44:03.821 --> 00:44:06.813
"Harry," he says to me,
"you make beautiful pants.


624
00:44:07.058 --> 00:44:10.050
When I was a boy, I dreamed
of wearing pants like these."


625
00:44:10.294 --> 00:44:11.283
His very words, Andy.

626
00:44:11.529 --> 00:44:14.657
To be quite frank,
do we have to meet here?


627
00:44:14.865 --> 00:44:16.856
It's not very salubrious.

628
00:44:17.068 --> 00:44:18.592
Good cover, Harry.

629
00:44:18.803 --> 00:44:23.831
They rent the rooms by the hour.
Cash. No questions asked.


630
00:44:24.041 --> 00:44:25.838
No paper trail.

631
00:44:26.043 --> 00:44:29.843
Anyone sees you going in, you're here
to get your end away. Same as me.


632
00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:35.078
So that's it, is it?

633
00:44:35.586 --> 00:44:38.646
Half hour's t¨şte-¨¤-t¨şte
about knickers.


634
00:44:40.257 --> 00:44:41.952
What about the canal?

635
00:44:42.827 --> 00:44:45.091
Did he say anything about his trip?

636
00:44:45.996 --> 00:44:47.293
He had talks, yes.

637
00:44:47.498 --> 00:44:50.956
"Constructive discussions,"
was his phrase, I believe.


638
00:44:52.503 --> 00:44:55.495
You're not gonna pay off the farm
at this rate.


639
00:45:02.113 --> 00:45:04.240
Andy, this is hard for me.

640
00:45:04.448 --> 00:45:07.884
He confides. A tailor's like a priest
in these situations.


641
00:45:08.085 --> 00:45:11.486
For me, the changing room is
as sacred as the confessional.


642
00:45:11.722 --> 00:45:13.952
Lips are sealed, eh?

643
00:45:15.593 --> 00:45:18.994
Have you had a chance to make
arrangements about the farm, Andy?


644
00:45:19.196 --> 00:45:22.996
Well, the money's there,
as long as you deliver.


645
00:45:32.443 --> 00:45:34.343
- He's selling it, Andy.
- What?


646
00:45:37.481 --> 00:45:39.005
The canal.

647
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:41.283
He's selling it?

648
00:45:41.485 --> 00:45:45.888
Has to. Needs the money.
Relieve the poverty. Infrastructure.


649
00:45:46.123 --> 00:45:47.613
Who's buying?

650
00:45:48.592 --> 00:45:49.422
Who's buying?

651
00:45:49.627 --> 00:45:52.323
Various interested parties, I believe.

652
00:45:52.863 --> 00:45:55.764
- Come on.
- He mentioned the French, the Japanese.


653
00:45:55.966 --> 00:45:57.297
And?

654
00:45:58.502 --> 00:45:59.935
Oh, yeah. And the Chinese.

655
00:46:00.137 --> 00:46:01.434
Harry.

656
00:46:02.173 --> 00:46:03.071
Andy.

657
00:46:04.208 --> 00:46:05.869
Are you pulling my pisser?

658
00:46:06.076 --> 00:46:08.476
Not unless the president's
pulling mine.


659
00:46:08.679 --> 00:46:11.944
This is fucking dynamite.
Does he always talk to you like this?


660
00:46:12.149 --> 00:46:13.446
Not always...

661
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:14.709
...but mostly.

662
00:46:14.919 --> 00:46:17.387
Now this is for the record.
Times, names, places.


663
00:46:17.588 --> 00:46:19.647
His actual words, if you
remember them.


664
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.381
Goose it up a bit.
It's going straight to the top.


665
00:46:22.626 --> 00:46:25.356
Here we go.
What kind of Chinese, by the way?


666
00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:28.321
You know, Chinese, like Chinese.

667
00:46:28.566 --> 00:46:32.093
Oh, fuck's sake.
I mean, mainland? Taiwan?


668
00:46:34.872 --> 00:46:37.363
The both, Andy. 
The two together.

669
00:46:37.575 --> 00:46:38.906
Hand in hand.

670
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:41.805
It's something the president's
very proud of...


671
00:46:42.012 --> 00:46:44.446
...bringing them together,
at the same table.


672
00:46:44.648 --> 00:46:49.745
"Harry," he says to me, "if it's all
I'm remembered for, then so be it.


673
00:46:49.954 --> 00:46:53.321
I brought reconciliation
to the great Chinese people...


674
00:46:53.557 --> 00:46:55.252
...for the betterment of all mankind."

675
00:46:55.626 --> 00:46:59.187
You've excelled. This is a better
yarn than Arthur Braithwaite.


676
00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:00.522
Are you implying...?

677
00:47:00.731 --> 00:47:03.029
Doesn't matter what I think.
It plays.


678
00:47:04.368 --> 00:47:06.563
First installments:
Abraxas and Marta.


679
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.796
- Installments?
- Payment on results, Harry.


680
00:47:10.007 --> 00:47:11.941
And the farm as such, Andy?

681
00:47:13.577 --> 00:47:15.010
Looking good.

682
00:47:15.613 --> 00:47:17.240
Oh, look at those tits.

683
00:47:20.484 --> 00:47:21.712
Yum-yum.

684
00:47:24.188 --> 00:47:27.385
You want to pay off the debt?
With what?


685
00:47:27.625 --> 00:47:29.889
Let's say I won the lottery, Ramon.

686
00:47:30.094 --> 00:47:33.063
And I want to
buy your farm from you.

687
00:47:33.297 --> 00:47:35.765
What do you mean,
you want to buy my farm?


688
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.228
I don't have no farm.

689
00:47:37.434 --> 00:47:41.336
Oh, yes, you do, Ramon.
I know all about it.


690
00:47:42.673 --> 00:47:44.231
Okay.

691
00:47:44.775 --> 00:47:48.211
You won the lottery, you can
pay me $3000 an acre.


692
00:47:48.412 --> 00:47:51.643
Two. You'll be paid
direct from Europe.


693
00:47:51.849 --> 00:47:54.875
I've made the necessary arrangements.

694
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:03.924
You won't mind if I deduct
your tailoring bill?


695
00:48:09.667 --> 00:48:11.635
It has a bad smell.

696
00:48:12.169 --> 00:48:13.727
That would be the fish.

697
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.471
I'll pay you back.
I'm going to straighten out.


698
00:48:21.245 --> 00:48:24.339
Just don't resent me
for doing you a favor.


699
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:31.981
Harry, this is Panama, where no
good deed goes unpunished.


700
00:49:11.595 --> 00:49:12.721
Right.

701
00:49:14.064 --> 00:49:16.999
There's two ways we can deal
with this one, old girl.


702
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:20.602
Sweat it out for six months,
then fall into each other's arms:


703
00:49:20.804 --> 00:49:23.602
"Darling, why didn't we ever
do this before?"


704
00:49:23.807 --> 00:49:27.038
Method B, the preferred one:

705
00:49:27.244 --> 00:49:30.407
Full-on affair now.
Observing tight security all round.


706
00:49:30.614 --> 00:49:33.708
See how we like it.
If we don't, no one's the wiser.


707
00:49:33.917 --> 00:49:38.752
I don't suppose it's occurred to you
that I might prefer someone else?


708
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.849
Is that a no?

709
00:49:46.864 --> 00:49:47.956
No.

710
00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:53.630
Come and dance.

711
00:49:54.772 --> 00:49:57.434
Oh, God, you don't dance as well,
do you?


712
00:49:58.475 --> 00:49:59.965
As well as what?

713
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:36.901
My chaps in London are in a bit
of a spin about it.


714
00:51:37.141 --> 00:51:39.439
I understand they're talking
to Washington.


715
00:51:39.643 --> 00:51:43.272
If the canal's being sold out,
how come we never got a whisper of it?


716
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.539
I'm sure the question
is being asked...


717
00:51:45.749 --> 00:51:48.479
...and not to your credit, Nigel,
as political officer.


718
00:51:48.685 --> 00:51:49.811
What about the Americans?

719
00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.512
They've got billions in
surveillance. They don't know?


720
00:51:53.757 --> 00:51:56.749
Perhaps they do know about it,
but they're not telling us.


721
00:51:58.428 --> 00:52:00.692
You're very quiet, Francesca.

722
00:52:00.898 --> 00:52:04.800
What are your feelings about
Andrew's amazing discoveries?


723
00:52:05.469 --> 00:52:07.903
Well, I couldn't possibly comment.

724
00:52:08.705 --> 00:52:11.606
No insight into the Osnard methods,
I'm afraid.


725
00:52:40.204 --> 00:52:42.104
Try not to look so furtive, Harry.

726
00:52:42.306 --> 00:52:45.332
- I'm feeling a little anxious.
- How do you think I feel?


727
00:52:45.542 --> 00:52:46.770
- Something wrong?
- Yes.


728
00:52:46.977 --> 00:52:49.002
We bombed in Washington.
Sit down.


729
00:52:49.246 --> 00:52:52.875
The Yanks say we're talking through
our asses. No Silent Opposition.


730
00:52:53.083 --> 00:52:55.916
No conspiracy to sell off the canal.
No fuck-all.


731
00:52:56.119 --> 00:52:58.644
- They can't say that.
- They just said it.


732
00:53:02.326 --> 00:53:04.886
The Buchan material
holds no credibility.


733
00:53:05.128 --> 00:53:07.756
No credibility equals no cash.

734
00:53:08.165 --> 00:53:11.566
Without the Yanks, London will
pull the entire project.


735
00:53:11.768 --> 00:53:15.329
- Why?
- Because in matters of intelligence...


736
00:53:15.539 --> 00:53:17.063
...as in most other matters...

737
00:53:17.274 --> 00:53:20.869
...merry England sucks
on the American hind tit.


738
00:53:21.078 --> 00:53:23.308
It's called,
"The special relationship."


739
00:53:24.348 --> 00:53:28.785
Mickie will be very downcast, Andy.
So will Marta.


740
00:53:28.986 --> 00:53:32.444
What about us? We both had
a good thing going here.


741
00:53:33.223 --> 00:53:35.054
I was counting on making a pension.

742
00:53:35.292 --> 00:53:37.157
You thinking of retiring?

743
00:53:41.064 --> 00:53:43.089
Scrap heap at 45 in this game.

744
00:53:43.333 --> 00:53:45.961
It was blue chip material.
You said so yourself.


745
00:53:46.169 --> 00:53:50.697
London needs something solid.
Documents, evidence.


746
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:56.473
Does your wife bring home papers,
canal stuff?


747
00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:00.279
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Does she? That's all.


748
00:54:00.484 --> 00:54:01.678
It happens.

749
00:54:07.391 --> 00:54:08.983
Take a look up its skirt.

750
00:54:15.766 --> 00:54:17.893
Come here. Come here.
Give it back.


751
00:54:19.903 --> 00:54:21.097
It's a camera.

752
00:54:23.006 --> 00:54:27.500
One picture's worth a thousand words.
Or a thousand bucks. Tell her that.


753
00:54:27.811 --> 00:54:28.675
- Tell her?
- Why not?


754
00:54:28.879 --> 00:54:31.370
Put her on the payroll.
Double your money.


755
00:54:31.682 --> 00:54:35.311
I want something in writing on
Delgado's dealings with the Chinese.


756
00:54:35.519 --> 00:54:36.679
No more bullshit.

757
00:54:36.887 --> 00:54:39.481
Louisa would never betray Delgado.

758
00:54:39.723 --> 00:54:41.054
She worships the man.

759
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:43.992
Does she know where you're at?

760
00:54:44.494 --> 00:54:45.688
Not an inkling.

761
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:48.994
Ever tell her about your prison days?

762
00:54:49.199 --> 00:54:50.223
Not as such.

763
00:54:50.434 --> 00:54:51.958
Haul her in, Harry...

764
00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:55.536
...or I might have to tell her
about Harry Pendel, the criminal.


765
00:54:55.739 --> 00:54:57.502
You stay away from her.

766
00:55:01.945 --> 00:55:03.845
Okay, I'll handle it.

767
00:55:13.223 --> 00:55:15.384
You're rather tense tonight, Lou.

768
00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:20.058
Maybe because you're peering
over my shoulder again.


769
00:55:21.365 --> 00:55:23.765
Or maybe because I had a call
from Donna.


770
00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:26.299
Donna?

771
00:55:26.737 --> 00:55:27.897
Teddy's wife.

772
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.368
She said you were seen coming
out of the Hotel Paraiso.


773
00:55:34.745 --> 00:55:39.273
I said, "Harry's a tailor. He has
clients from all walks of life."


774
00:55:40.717 --> 00:55:41.775
True.

775
00:55:42.052 --> 00:55:44.486
You'd never meet them
at the Hotel Paraiso.


776
00:55:45.088 --> 00:55:48.546
I had a fitting with Andy.
Andy Osnard.


777
00:55:48.759 --> 00:55:50.090
He's a bit eccentric.

778
00:55:51.194 --> 00:55:52.684
Are you seeing someone?

779
00:55:53.063 --> 00:55:54.121
Me?

780
00:55:58.502 --> 00:56:01.630
You stay out late
and you don't say where.


781
00:56:04.007 --> 00:56:07.443
You come at me like a lover and
then you don't touch me for weeks.


782
00:56:09.813 --> 00:56:11.337
What's going on, Harry?

783
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:13.976
Who's getting the rest of you?

784
00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:16.685
Uncle Benny, I'm cornered.

785
00:56:17.087 --> 00:56:19.487
There's nothing for it
but to tell her the truth.


786
00:56:20.023 --> 00:56:21.513
She deserves the truth.

787
00:56:21.758 --> 00:56:24.192
Harry-boy, I've told you
time and again:


788
00:56:24.428 --> 00:56:28.091
A man who tells the truth is bound
to be found out sooner or later.


789
00:56:28.298 --> 00:56:30.823
Try sincerity, that's a virtue.

790
00:56:31.034 --> 00:56:33.696
But truth, it's an affliction.

791
00:56:33.904 --> 00:56:35.929
I swear to you on my life...

792
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.639
...there's no other woman.

793
00:56:40.077 --> 00:56:43.171
Never has been. 
Never will be.

794
00:56:46.383 --> 00:56:47.509
Okay.

795
00:56:56.359 --> 00:56:57.724
Louisa?

796
00:57:42.472 --> 00:57:44.804
I'm a thief in my own home.

797
00:57:45.008 --> 00:57:48.273
<i>But with best intentions.
With a good heart.</i>


798
00:57:48.745 --> 00:57:51.339
<i>For the family.
Like you did for me.</i>


799
00:57:51.548 --> 00:57:52.674
That's true.

800
00:57:52.883 --> 00:57:55.010
<i>You're the apple of my eye, Harry.</i>

801
00:57:55.218 --> 00:57:58.779
<i>Stay shtum, and I'll
always be there for you.</i>


802
00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:02.558
Harry. Harry!

803
00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:07.956
I couldn't sleep.

804
00:58:09.399 --> 00:58:12.698
What do you mean you couldn't sleep?
You were just out cold.


805
00:58:14.337 --> 00:58:16.396
Busy times at the shop, Lou.

806
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:19.706
So who is this Andy Osnard?

807
00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:23.643
- Tell me about him.
- He's become a bit of a pal...


808
00:58:24.014 --> 00:58:24.981
...as such.

809
00:58:26.483 --> 00:58:28.417
I used to be your pal...

810
00:58:28.618 --> 00:58:29.915
..."as such."

811
00:58:31.021 --> 00:58:32.613
I'd like to meet him.

812
00:58:32.856 --> 00:58:35.324
Why don't you invite him on Sunday?

813
00:58:36.259 --> 00:58:37.851
That's Sarah's birthday.

814
00:58:38.762 --> 00:58:39.786
Why not?

815
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.661
I could look into it.

816
00:58:43.166 --> 00:58:45.634
If you don't want to call him,
I'll call him.


817
00:58:47.437 --> 00:58:48.335
Good.

818
00:59:05.655 --> 00:59:07.987
- And this season's suits
are very thin...


819
00:59:08.225 --> 00:59:10.455
...and it's lined with Panama's
best fabric.


820
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:20.229
Buchan.

821
00:59:20.503 --> 00:59:23.472
Lady Jane's. Twenty minutes.
That's two-zero minutes.


822
00:59:24.174 --> 00:59:25.436
Over and out.

823
01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:13.885
He's been waiting and complaining.

824
01:00:14.257 --> 01:00:18.694
Sorry, Teddy. Jacket's ready.
Just pop into the fitting room.


825
01:00:24.134 --> 01:00:25.931
Sorry, Jaime, I need this.

826
01:00:31.574 --> 01:00:33.132
In you go, Teddy.

827
01:00:38.915 --> 01:00:41.042
Wow! Even better than I thought.

828
01:00:41.251 --> 01:00:43.685
You look like Bobby De Niro
in this jacket.


829
01:00:43.887 --> 01:00:47.084
Don't schmooze me, Harry.
What's going on?


830
01:00:47.324 --> 01:00:49.918
Little bird tells me
you paid off your overdraft.


831
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.752
Business is good, Teddy.

832
01:00:51.995 --> 01:00:53.826
I smell a story.

833
01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:55.395
There's no story.

834
01:00:56.266 --> 01:00:58.359
You want me to make one up?

835
01:00:58.568 --> 01:01:00.695
Don't. Louisa reads
your gossip column.


836
01:01:00.904 --> 01:01:02.895
I don't want her to know
I owed money.


837
01:01:03.106 --> 01:01:04.937
Come clean.

838
01:01:05.508 --> 01:01:07.567
Probably won't run it.

839
01:01:08.078 --> 01:01:11.639
I'm like that. The more I know,
the less I print.


840
01:01:16.386 --> 01:01:18.718
You know I'll find out
what you're up to...


841
01:01:19.689 --> 01:01:20.883
...don't you?

842
01:01:47.784 --> 01:01:50.048
Well, I had absolutely no idea...

843
01:01:50.253 --> 01:01:52.346
...how delightful
Panama was gonna be.


844
01:01:52.555 --> 01:01:54.955
Yes, it's beautiful country.

845
01:01:55.825 --> 01:01:57.850
I was thinking about the people.

846
01:01:59.129 --> 01:02:02.565
Meant a lot to me,
being able to tag along today.


847
01:02:02.766 --> 01:02:05.394
It's been a real pleasure
to have you along, Andy.


848
01:02:05.602 --> 01:02:06.830
Hasn't it, darling?

849
01:02:07.704 --> 01:02:09.763
Can we go and see the monkeys, Dad?

850
01:02:10.306 --> 01:02:11.500
There's a monkey island.

851
01:02:11.708 --> 01:02:13.676
- We bring bananas for them.
- Wonderful.


852
01:02:13.877 --> 01:02:16.607
- What's my birthday girl say?
- Can Andy come too?


853
01:02:16.813 --> 01:02:20.442
No, Andy needs to stay here
and keep Mommy company.


854
01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:22.049
You go with Dad.

855
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.927
In you go.

856
01:02:32.162 --> 01:02:33.857
Cast off, captain.

857
01:02:40.136 --> 01:02:41.569
So, Andy...

858
01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:44.907
...maybe you wouldn't mind
telling me what you're up to.


859
01:02:48.178 --> 01:02:49.202
Sorry?

860
01:02:49.479 --> 01:02:53.882
There's something between you and my
husband, I know it. I can feel it.


861
01:02:54.884 --> 01:02:58.980
Ever since he's met you, he's
a changed man. Sneaky and secretive.


862
01:03:02.325 --> 01:03:06.022
All of a sudden, I'm his enemy
and you're his friend.


863
01:03:08.798 --> 01:03:11.892
If I didn't know him better,
I'd say you two were gay.


864
01:03:17.907 --> 01:03:19.841
Do you want it straight?

865
01:03:22.078 --> 01:03:23.204
Always.

866
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.047
You'll keep it secret?

867
01:03:26.716 --> 01:03:27.705
If I have to.

868
01:03:31.221 --> 01:03:34.884
And he's told you nothing?
Absolutely nothing?


869
01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:36.652
Zero.

870
01:03:37.894 --> 01:03:40.124
Information is my business. Gossip.

871
01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:41.922
Harry's kind of gossip.

872
01:03:42.131 --> 01:03:44.361
He's smart, he's down-to-earth.

873
01:03:44.567 --> 01:03:46.694
He's got great contacts and no agenda.

874
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:49.297
Are you talking about spying?

875
01:03:49.906 --> 01:03:53.865
Oh, that's much too heavy a word
for what Harry's doing.


876
01:03:55.078 --> 01:03:59.037
- Are you paying him?
- No money, I'm afraid.


877
01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:01.615
Just the honor
and privilege of service.


878
01:04:04.153 --> 01:04:07.884
Is that why he's been looking
at all my private papers?


879
01:04:08.691 --> 01:04:10.784
Oh, no. Harry.

880
01:04:11.427 --> 01:04:12.587
Oh, bless him.

881
01:04:13.563 --> 01:04:15.929
That really is going too far.

882
01:04:17.834 --> 01:04:19.961
Spying on his own wife.

883
01:04:24.107 --> 01:04:25.438
I'm terribly sorry.

884
01:04:27.877 --> 01:04:31.040
Still, you are the canal, aren't you?

885
01:04:31.247 --> 01:04:34.216
You sit at Ernie Delgado's right hand.

886
01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:38.744
Harry's aware that we're desperate
to know what will become of it.


887
01:04:41.457 --> 01:04:44.290
The canal is always gonna run
the way it's run.


888
01:04:45.862 --> 01:04:48.092
Ernie Delgado will make sure of it.

889
01:04:48.298 --> 01:04:49.765
That's as may be...

890
01:04:51.034 --> 01:04:52.729
...but it's our main artery.

891
01:04:52.936 --> 01:04:55.962
You can't blame us if we need
constant reassurance.


892
01:04:58.675 --> 01:05:00.609
Harry's only trying to help.

893
01:05:02.512 --> 01:05:03.740
Don't...

894
01:05:05.448 --> 01:05:06.881
...use him.

895
01:05:08.618 --> 01:05:09.983
I love him.

896
01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.885
As we both do.

897
01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.280
I'm going for a swim.

898
01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.827
- There's one.
- Where?


899
01:05:19.028 --> 01:05:19.995
- Up there.
- Oh, yeah!


900
01:05:20.196 --> 01:05:21.993
Oh, he's lovely!

901
01:05:27.136 --> 01:05:28.398
So...

902
01:05:30.607 --> 01:05:33.906
Tell me,
how did Harry win your heart?


903
01:05:35.979 --> 01:05:38.277
I was raised in the canal...

904
01:05:38.548 --> 01:05:41.312
...around military types
and engineers like my father...


905
01:05:41.517 --> 01:05:43.883
...and I had never met anyone
like Harry.


906
01:05:44.087 --> 01:05:46.351
He treated me like a princess.

907
01:05:47.423 --> 01:05:49.084
Sent me flowers every day.

908
01:05:49.325 --> 01:05:50.758
Wrote me love letters.

909
01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.896
Did he have to get
Arthur Braithwaite's permission?


910
01:05:55.732 --> 01:05:59.930
He called him in London.
He was on his deathbed, the poor man.


911
01:06:00.136 --> 01:06:01.501
Oh, God.

912
01:06:03.206 --> 01:06:05.367
Did he fly over for the funeral?

913
01:06:06.142 --> 01:06:07.700
Arthur forbade it.

914
01:06:08.211 --> 01:06:11.669
Harry was completely wiped out.

915
01:06:12.215 --> 01:06:13.978
I'm sure he was.

916
01:06:23.893 --> 01:06:28.592
So the two of you have lived
happily ever after ever since?


917
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.125
Yeah, until you came along.

918
01:06:35.638 --> 01:06:37.333
Don't you ever feel like...

919
01:06:38.241 --> 01:06:39.902
...breaking out?

920
01:06:42.612 --> 01:06:44.273
Running wild...

921
01:06:45.281 --> 01:06:47.306
...just for the badness?

922
01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:51.815
Never.

923
01:06:53.523 --> 01:06:55.491
Harry is my virtue.

924
01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.757
Without him...

925
01:07:01.264 --> 01:07:02.492
...I'd be...

926
01:07:02.699 --> 01:07:04.098
You'd be...

927
01:07:04.934 --> 01:07:07.528
...like Harry without
Arthur Braithwaite.


928
01:07:21.718 --> 01:07:24.118
Well, she's finally asleep.

929
01:07:26.222 --> 01:07:28.156
I think she enjoyed her day.

930
01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:30.215
Yeah, I think so too.

931
01:07:35.798 --> 01:07:37.129
And did you?

932
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.191
Yeah. Kind of.

933
01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:43.402
What did you and Andy
find to talk about?


934
01:07:45.608 --> 01:07:47.041
You, mostly.

935
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.605
Bit of a boring topic, wasn't it?

936
01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.639
You're a very surprising person,
Harry Pendel.


937
01:07:55.985 --> 01:07:58.249
After all these years?

938
01:07:59.422 --> 01:08:01.947
Just don't come between me
and Ernie Delgado.


939
01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:05.690
My work is off-limits.
Do you understand?


940
01:08:05.895 --> 01:08:08.227
Okay, Lou. Absolutely.

941
01:08:08.798 --> 01:08:09.992
Done.

942
01:08:19.976 --> 01:08:21.170
Harry.

943
01:08:21.978 --> 01:08:22.967
What?

944
01:08:24.113 --> 01:08:25.876
Make me laugh.

945
01:08:35.458 --> 01:08:37.858
- You've got a gift for it.
- What?


946
01:08:39.729 --> 01:08:40.889
Letting go.

947
01:08:42.064 --> 01:08:46.125
- Few people can.
- You can't, or won't.


948
01:08:46.903 --> 01:08:47.995
No.

949
01:08:48.638 --> 01:08:52.768
- I've been reading your files.
- Oh, those fucking files.


950
01:08:54.544 --> 01:08:56.978
We know too much about each other.

951
01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:00.448
Kills the romance.

952
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:02.383
What romance?

953
01:09:03.119 --> 01:09:05.986
Oh, shit! Shit.

954
01:09:09.592 --> 01:09:10.616
Yes?

955
01:09:11.294 --> 01:09:13.319
Yeah. What?

956
01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:16.630
It's a bit of a bad time, actually.

957
01:09:17.433 --> 01:09:19.765
I didn't know what she knew,
did I?


958
01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:24.604
Well, I'm sure you handled it
like a master.


959
01:09:25.641 --> 01:09:28.838
Look... Hey, I had to think
on my feet, didn't I?


960
01:09:29.378 --> 01:09:30.709
All right.

961
01:09:31.514 --> 01:09:33.004
All right, if you must.

962
01:09:34.584 --> 01:09:36.176
Rendezvous number three.

963
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.751
You know where that is, don't you?
Oh, good.


964
01:09:41.457 --> 01:09:43.425
Twenty-three hundred hours.
Good.


965
01:09:45.561 --> 01:09:48.997
What warrants dragging me out of
the saddle on a Sunday night, eh?


966
01:09:49.232 --> 01:09:50.199
Look, about Louisa.

967
01:09:50.433 --> 01:09:53.960
Some woman, Harry. I envy you.
The way she looks up to you.


968
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.502
You're her moral virtue, her center.

969
01:09:56.706 --> 01:09:59.971
Just like Arthur Braithwaite
was to you, is what she said.


970
01:10:00.476 --> 01:10:01.841
I enjoyed the comparison.

971
01:10:02.044 --> 01:10:03.671
- You say anything?
- Would I ever?


972
01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.747
Expect me to tell her that
an old Jew brought me up?


973
01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:08.917
Burned his frocks as a favor?

974
01:10:09.118 --> 01:10:10.779
Hated the old fellow, did you?

975
01:10:10.987 --> 01:10:14.787
- I know this place where we can talk.
- I loved him. I revere him.


976
01:10:15.024 --> 01:10:18.357
Dressed him up as Arthur Braithwaite.
Gave him a good suit.


977
01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:21.029
"Clothes maketh the man,"
and all that.


978
01:10:51.594 --> 01:10:54.654
Come on, let's dance.
Camp it up a bit.


979
01:11:15.484 --> 01:11:17.611
Come on. I'll lead.

980
01:11:19.622 --> 01:11:23.114
So, I gather you've made
no attempt to recruit her so far.


981
01:11:23.359 --> 01:11:25.657
As of now, that is correct.

982
01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:27.920
Seemed perfectly approachable to me.

983
01:11:28.164 --> 01:11:31.395
- Thought I'd have a go at her myself.
- No, don't do that.


984
01:11:32.301 --> 01:11:34.826
Is this what you came to tell me?
Lay off her?


985
01:11:35.037 --> 01:11:37.335
I came to tell you
I've had enough.


986
01:11:37.673 --> 01:11:38.503
I want out.

987
01:11:38.708 --> 01:11:42.439
I don't think so. You've taken
the money, I want something for it.


988
01:11:43.079 --> 01:11:44.546
Those documents.

989
01:11:44.747 --> 01:11:47.341
Those ones that you snapped.
Did you read them?


990
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:50.986
- I was pushed for time, Andy.
- Pension scheme for lock-keepers.


991
01:11:51.187 --> 01:11:54.020
Dredging contract.
Water analysis. Zilch.


992
01:11:54.256 --> 01:11:56.747
Time to deliver.
I'm tired of your bullshit.


993
01:11:56.993 --> 01:11:58.426
I can't go on with it!

994
01:11:59.128 --> 01:12:00.959
You want me to tell Louisa...

995
01:12:01.163 --> 01:12:02.960
...about Harry the convict?

996
01:12:07.503 --> 01:12:09.437
Will you tell me what you want?

997
01:12:09.805 --> 01:12:10.829
Come here.

998
01:12:11.374 --> 01:12:14.138
Keep moving. Stop acting so butch.

999
01:12:15.411 --> 01:12:19.848
If the canal's being flogged off
on presidential instructions...


1000
01:12:20.049 --> 01:12:23.985
...what's the price? Who's the buyer?
When do they sign the contract?


1001
01:12:24.186 --> 01:12:27.952
How much are Delgado and the pres
creaming off for themselves?


1002
01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:29.657
- Right.
- Can't hear you.


1003
01:12:29.859 --> 01:12:31.952
- Right.
- Then there's your end of the bargain.


1004
01:12:32.194 --> 01:12:36.426
Abraxas, the Silent Opposition.
Are they going for direct action?


1005
01:12:36.632 --> 01:12:39.795
- Direct action being in this case?
- Shootibangs.


1006
01:12:40.002 --> 01:12:42.163
Raising proletarian consciousness.

1007
01:12:42.371 --> 01:12:45.135
Bombing banks, gunning down
a couple millionaires.


1008
01:12:45.341 --> 01:12:49.141
- No, not Mickie, not Marta.
- So, what the fuck are they doing?


1009
01:12:49.345 --> 01:12:53.111
Who are they buying arms from?
What are they gonna do with them?


1010
01:12:53.315 --> 01:12:56.079
They'll have to do more than
wear white shirts...


1011
01:12:56.285 --> 01:12:59.186
...and get the shit beaten
out of them by the dingbats!


1012
01:12:59.388 --> 01:13:01.288
- Come on.
- I've got to get out.


1013
01:13:01.524 --> 01:13:03.116
I can't think.

1014
01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:05.990
- I can't breathe.
- Go, Harry. Go, go, go.


1015
01:13:10.266 --> 01:13:12.860
Get me some answers.
Your ass is on the line.


1016
01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:15.833
London's coming.
Get the stuff, we make you rich.


1017
01:13:16.038 --> 01:13:19.439
You don't, we tell the Pans
you've been spying for the Yanks.


1018
01:13:19.642 --> 01:13:22.839
You and Louisa both.
Do you understand what I'm saying?


1019
01:13:32.254 --> 01:13:34.188
I haven't come clean with you.

1020
01:13:35.124 --> 01:13:36.989
I've been dragging my feet.

1021
01:13:37.359 --> 01:13:39.384
At Mickie's behest, I might add.

1022
01:13:40.496 --> 01:13:43.090
He has a huge arms shipment
on the way.


1023
01:13:43.299 --> 01:13:45.699
But he'll pay for it
from another source.


1024
01:13:45.901 --> 01:13:48.927
Oh, yeah? Who the fuck would that be?

1025
01:13:49.138 --> 01:13:50.469
Won't say.

1026
01:13:50.873 --> 01:13:52.773
No, he wouldn't, would he?

1027
01:13:52.975 --> 01:13:56.069
- How much?
- It's big money, Andy.


1028
01:13:56.278 --> 01:13:59.304
"Harry," he says to me,
"your guys pay peanuts.


1029
01:13:59.515 --> 01:14:01.142
This is out of their league."

1030
01:14:02.251 --> 01:14:03.377
Well...

1031
01:14:04.587 --> 01:14:07.351
...this is an interesting
development, Harry.


1032
01:14:08.023 --> 01:14:10.457
- Give me a ballpark figure.
- Ten.


1033
01:14:10.659 --> 01:14:13.355
We're talking
ten million dollars, Andy.


1034
01:14:13.562 --> 01:14:15.029
Ten million dollars?

1035
01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:16.798
Yeah.

1036
01:14:17.533 --> 01:14:20.127
Ten million dollars.

1037
01:14:22.938 --> 01:14:24.235
Yeah.

1038
01:14:33.616 --> 01:14:35.277
- Andrew.
- Sir.


1039
01:14:35.484 --> 01:14:37.714
The winds of fortune
blew me to Caracas...


1040
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.412
...allowing me this brief stopover.
I'm on my way to Washington.


1041
01:14:41.657 --> 01:14:46.026
Our revered leader, Henry Cavendish,
is coming too. Pick up the phone.


1042
01:14:46.262 --> 01:14:48.162
There's prestige at stake, you see.

1043
01:14:48.364 --> 01:14:49.228
Oh, Andrew...

1044
01:14:50.132 --> 01:14:54.228
...I've come all this way to look
you in the eye and ask you this:


1045
01:14:54.436 --> 01:14:58.702
Can you back it up?
Are we copper-bottomed?


1046
01:15:00.075 --> 01:15:01.337
Yes.

1047
01:15:03.512 --> 01:15:06.948
- How much are they asking for?
- Fifteen million.


1048
01:15:07.483 --> 01:15:08.745
Fifteen.

1049
01:15:09.585 --> 01:15:12.383
If I get it for you,
can you guarantee action?


1050
01:15:12.688 --> 01:15:14.053
Oh, absolutely.

1051
01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:15.757
Go after them, Andrew.

1052
01:15:15.958 --> 01:15:19.758
Push. The iron is hot.
Strike!


1053
01:15:23.766 --> 01:15:27.065
Sir, can I have your glass?
We are ready for landing.


1054
01:15:30.139 --> 01:15:31.333
Thank you.

1055
01:15:41.584 --> 01:15:44.314
Oh, Harry. I hear that Delgado...

1056
01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.580
...is setting up a canal
police force...


1057
01:15:47.823 --> 01:15:49.848
...with powers to search the ships.

1058
01:15:50.092 --> 01:15:55.394
It'll never happen. It would kill
the drug trade, the arms trade...


1059
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:57.792
...everything we hold dear.

1060
01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.862
The way it is now,
you pay your dues...


1061
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:04.665
...you don't piss in the locks,
they don't fuck with you.


1062
01:16:04.873 --> 01:16:08.138
Does Louisa know anything
about this little plan, Harry?


1063
01:16:08.344 --> 01:16:09.902
Leave Louisa out of this.

1064
01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:14.412
Take it easy, Harry.
Time you took some holiday.


1065
01:16:15.117 --> 01:16:18.518
- You look fucked out.
- Maybe if you paid your bill...


1066
01:16:18.721 --> 01:16:21.417
...I might be able to.
- Maybe you'd be healthier...


1067
01:16:21.657 --> 01:16:23.352
...if you stuck to tailoring.

1068
01:16:23.659 --> 01:16:25.889
- Listen, Teddy...
- Hey, Harry.


1069
01:16:26.528 --> 01:16:27.995
It doesn't look right.

1070
01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.391
This isn't a suit,
it's a piece of shit.


1071
01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:34.936
Come on, it's the first fitting.
It can be fixed.


1072
01:16:35.137 --> 01:16:37.503
I don't know.
Think I'm gonna go to Armani.


1073
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.831
Get myself a proper suit.

1074
01:16:42.544 --> 01:16:45.411
He doesn't like it when
I mention Armani.


1075
01:16:45.614 --> 01:16:47.707
Harry, why you make me this shit?

1076
01:16:47.916 --> 01:16:49.941
Why can't you make
a suit like Armani?


1077
01:16:50.152 --> 01:16:51.915
Why can't I make
a suit like Armani?


1078
01:16:54.823 --> 01:16:57.519
You think Armani can make
a suit like Harry Pendel?


1079
01:16:57.793 --> 01:16:59.021
Why not?

1080
01:16:59.461 --> 01:17:03.056
Okay, fuck off. Go down the road,
buy an Armani!


1081
01:17:03.265 --> 01:17:05.790
Save yourself $1000,
see if I care!


1082
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:08.936
At Pendel and Braithwaite
you get Savile Row tailoring...


1083
01:17:09.138 --> 01:17:11.265
...with 400 years of tradition
behind it.


1084
01:17:11.473 --> 01:17:14.135
Down the road you get an
Italian gents' outfitter.


1085
01:17:14.343 --> 01:17:17.039
If you don't understand,
then save your money.


1086
01:17:17.246 --> 01:17:18.611
Hey, Harry, come on.

1087
01:17:19.214 --> 01:17:22.149
The whole country's
going down the plug hole!


1088
01:17:22.351 --> 01:17:24.342
Nobody cares!

1089
01:17:24.553 --> 01:17:27.147
Someone's got to stand up
and be counted!


1090
01:17:27.389 --> 01:17:31.155
Someone has to say, "Here I am.
This is what I stand for!"


1091
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.351
Impeccable standards and...

1092
01:17:33.595 --> 01:17:35.256
...and old-fashioned integrity!

1093
01:17:35.464 --> 01:17:38.297
And if you don't like it,
you can go down the road!


1094
01:17:38.734 --> 01:17:40.793
Gentlemen, you go down that road...

1095
01:17:41.003 --> 01:17:42.436
...you can never come back.

1096
01:17:42.638 --> 01:17:46.130
When you've gone down that road
it's over, it's curtains.


1097
01:17:46.342 --> 01:17:48.742
And I'm not just talking about Panama!

1098
01:17:48.944 --> 01:17:52.004
I'm talking about
the whole human race.


1099
01:18:01.957 --> 01:18:04.357
You too. Get out.

1100
01:18:09.264 --> 01:18:11.732
Harry, I was only kidding, I swear.

1101
01:18:12.201 --> 01:18:15.932
It's just a sleeve.
I swear to God.


1102
01:18:23.679 --> 01:18:25.237
Teddy came to see Mickie.

1103
01:18:25.447 --> 01:18:29.315
He brought two goons with him.
Said they were Ministry of Interior.


1104
01:18:29.518 --> 01:18:30.610
Teddy?

1105
01:18:30.886 --> 01:18:32.683
Of course, he's the worst.

1106
01:18:32.888 --> 01:18:35.015
They pay him, the ruling families.

1107
01:18:35.257 --> 01:18:37.418
He takes money to inform
on his friends.


1108
01:18:37.793 --> 01:18:39.818
They were asking around about us.

1109
01:18:40.462 --> 01:18:41.986
They came to me too.

1110
01:18:42.898 --> 01:18:46.299
Thinks we're involved in a
political thing against the system.


1111
01:18:46.502 --> 01:18:48.094
You know, like the old times.

1112
01:18:48.303 --> 01:18:50.771
- You and Marta?
- You and Mickie.


1113
01:18:50.973 --> 01:18:52.770
Why would they think that?

1114
01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:54.470
Maybe you know, Harry.

1115
01:18:57.012 --> 01:18:58.741
I couldn't do it again.

1116
01:18:59.748 --> 01:19:03.309
No more prison.
They break you in there.


1117
01:19:04.486 --> 01:19:07.944
You got so much courage in life.
When it's gone, it's spent.


1118
01:19:09.124 --> 01:19:10.614
I got none left.

1119
01:19:10.826 --> 01:19:13.795
I know what you mean.
I've been there, I know.


1120
01:19:17.332 --> 01:19:18.629
And they came to you?

1121
01:19:20.502 --> 01:19:24.097
Big Chinese guy.
The man who beat her before.


1122
01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:28.774
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing. They wanted information.


1123
01:19:28.977 --> 01:19:33.641
If I didn't give it to them, they'd
make me look the same, both sides.


1124
01:19:33.849 --> 01:19:36.545
- What information?
- About the two of you.


1125
01:19:36.752 --> 01:19:38.845
How often you meet,
what you talk about.


1126
01:19:39.087 --> 01:19:42.784
I want you both to get out of town.
Take a holiday.


1127
01:19:43.525 --> 01:19:45.959
There's a fireworks festival
in Guarare.


1128
01:19:46.195 --> 01:19:48.891
You love fireworks.
The address is on the label.


1129
01:19:49.097 --> 01:19:51.088
Pete Abuleira lent it to me.

1130
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.029
What are you going to do?

1131
01:19:53.235 --> 01:19:54.668
Sort it out.

1132
01:19:55.404 --> 01:19:57.201
Talk to people I know.

1133
01:20:00.275 --> 01:20:02.140
Better we go in separate cars.

1134
01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:03.538
I follow you later.

1135
01:20:03.745 --> 01:20:05.542
No more drinking now.

1136
01:20:07.249 --> 01:20:08.682
Thanks, Harry.

1137
01:20:09.284 --> 01:20:10.114
Take care.

1138
01:20:15.524 --> 01:20:18.220
I never lied to you, Marta.
You know that.


1139
01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:21.987
I didn't tell you everything,
but what I told you was true.


1140
01:20:22.631 --> 01:20:26.761
There's only so many people you
can do that to. Tell the truth.


1141
01:20:27.302 --> 01:20:29.862
Other people are different.
They need to be...


1142
01:20:30.105 --> 01:20:31.436
Tailored.

1143
01:20:31.874 --> 01:20:33.501
Helped. Yes.

1144
01:20:34.810 --> 01:20:37.779
You flatter them. 
You make things up.

1145
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:41.008
They start believing you, Harry.

1146
01:20:41.283 --> 01:20:44.650
Their leading man is one
Michelangelo Abraxas.


1147
01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.319
<i>Known to many, I am sure,
as the elusive Pimpernel...</i>


1148
01:20:48.557 --> 01:20:52.550
<i>... of the popular movement
against General Manuel Noriega.</i>


1149
01:20:52.861 --> 01:20:55.329
<i>Abraxas is a man
of proven integrity...</i>


1150
01:20:55.531 --> 01:20:57.726
<i>... skilled in clandestine warfare.</i>

1151
01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.958
His second in command...

1152
01:21:00.168 --> 01:21:03.103
...but I submit his equal
in skill and resolution...


1153
01:21:03.305 --> 01:21:04.932
...is code name "Marta."

1154
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.867
Another veteran of the
anti-Noriega resistance.


1155
01:21:09.378 --> 01:21:12.745
For cover purposes, she is
employed as accountant receptionist...


1156
01:21:12.948 --> 01:21:15.439
...by our own Panamanian head agent...

1157
01:21:15.651 --> 01:21:17.585
...the redoubtable Buchan.

1158
01:21:18.287 --> 01:21:21.347
If I may say so, Elliot,
a "Silent Opposition"...


1159
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:23.581
...doesn't send radio messages.

1160
01:21:23.792 --> 01:21:25.487
Half don't possess telephones.

1161
01:21:25.727 --> 01:21:28.787
Why else would they call
themselves silent?


1162
01:21:29.031 --> 01:21:31.226
They're a life-force, not an embassy.

1163
01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:33.765
Fishermen...

1164
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:38.301
...small farmers, peasants,
have-nots, penniless students.


1165
01:21:38.507 --> 01:21:41.067
People we wouldn't
entertain in the woodshed.


1166
01:21:41.343 --> 01:21:44.005
So why should we support them, Henry?

1167
01:21:44.212 --> 01:21:46.578
Because if we don't,
someone else will.


1168
01:21:46.782 --> 01:21:50.479
Because the Silent Opposition is
the new Panama in the new millennium.


1169
01:21:50.819 --> 01:21:53.014
And getting in with these chaps...

1170
01:21:53.221 --> 01:21:56.782
...is the sweetest, cheapest
way of saving the canal.


1171
01:21:57.426 --> 01:22:00.327
Do you think personally,
this Abraxas is...


1172
01:22:00.529 --> 01:22:03.123
...presidential material?

1173
01:22:03.332 --> 01:22:04.162
Scotty.

1174
01:22:04.399 --> 01:22:07.368
Abraxas is world-class.
Courageous...


1175
01:22:07.569 --> 01:22:10.436
<i>... unsullied, incorruptible.</i>

1176
01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.506
<i>A man to dream of
when you're shaping nations.</i>


1177
01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.917
But Abraxas can't go it alone.
He needs our support now.


1178
01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:31.091
If U.S. Military assistance
is guaranteed...


1179
01:22:31.326 --> 01:22:34.727
...Abraxas and his forces will
launch an attack on the government.


1180
01:22:34.997 --> 01:22:39.161
They'll commandeer the radio stations
and the Canal Administration Office.


1181
01:22:39.368 --> 01:22:41.962
Subject, of course,
to advance payment...


1182
01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:44.502
...for arms, equipment
and medical supplies.


1183
01:22:45.741 --> 01:22:46.867
How much?

1184
01:22:47.976 --> 01:22:51.173
The sort of money you boys
leave under the plate, Elliot.


1185
01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.681
- How much?
- Twenty million dollars.


1186
01:22:59.154 --> 01:23:01.952
Elliot, may I say a couple
of words, please?


1187
01:23:03.859 --> 01:23:06.089
I'm only a rookie at heart.

1188
01:23:06.294 --> 01:23:10.924
I don't know too much about the ins
and outs of politics, but I know this:


1189
01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:15.603
I was the last American
commander in Panama.


1190
01:23:16.138 --> 01:23:19.574
I had the task of taking
our men out of there.


1191
01:23:21.143 --> 01:23:23.304
Only retreat of my career.

1192
01:23:27.115 --> 01:23:28.776
Broke my heart.

1193
01:23:31.953 --> 01:23:35.912
There is a missing star
on our flag, gentlemen.


1194
01:23:37.559 --> 01:23:41.757
Looks to me that God has
given us a second chance here.


1195
01:23:45.867 --> 01:23:47.095
Yes?

1196
01:23:49.571 --> 01:23:50.731
Sir.

1197
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:56.777
Encrypted.

1198
01:23:57.646 --> 01:23:59.910
It went over like ninepins.

1199
01:24:00.115 --> 01:24:02.083
Asked for 20 and guess what?

1200
01:24:02.284 --> 01:24:04.582
They beat me down to 15.

1201
01:24:04.786 --> 01:24:06.219
I'm on my way.

1202
01:24:06.421 --> 01:24:07.854
Press play, Andy.

1203
01:24:09.391 --> 01:24:11.291
Teddy! Teddy!

1204
01:24:11.526 --> 01:24:13.585
Why are you hassling Mickie and Marta?

1205
01:24:13.829 --> 01:24:15.922
What are they up to this time, Harry?

1206
01:24:16.131 --> 01:24:19.532
What are you up to?
Spin me one of your stories.


1207
01:24:19.735 --> 01:24:21.532
You stay away from them or else.

1208
01:24:21.737 --> 01:24:24.672
How could you fuck
that faceless half-breed?


1209
01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:30.007
No, no. Relax.

1210
01:24:30.212 --> 01:24:32.442
You're a disgrace to that suit, Teddy.

1211
01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:35.780
- Hey.
- Louisa.


1212
01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:40.586
- There's something I must tell you.
- Okay.


1213
01:24:40.889 --> 01:24:41.981
Lou.

1214
01:24:42.224 --> 01:24:45.022
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.


1215
01:24:46.762 --> 01:24:47.956
Hello?

1216
01:24:49.197 --> 01:24:50.630
Marta?

1217
01:24:50.866 --> 01:24:54.495
Yeah, it's Louisa. 
I can't hear you.

1218
01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.140
I'll get... Okay.

1219
01:25:01.076 --> 01:25:02.168
It's for you.

1220
01:25:10.685 --> 01:25:11.947
It's me.

1221
01:25:12.754 --> 01:25:16.281
<i>Oh, Harry. I need you. 
Please come.</i>

1222
01:25:20.095 --> 01:25:21.824
<i>It's Mickie. He...</i>

1223
01:25:23.832 --> 01:25:25.026
Marta?

1224
01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.838
- I've gotta go.
- So it's Marta?


1225
01:25:34.042 --> 01:25:37.068
- All this time, under my nose.
- No, you don't understand.


1226
01:25:37.279 --> 01:25:39.645
Oh, come on, Harry. Please.

1227
01:25:40.182 --> 01:25:41.308
Be a man.

1228
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:44.517
- Well, if you love her, go.
- Yes, I do love her.


1229
01:25:46.521 --> 01:25:48.580
But I've never made love to her.

1230
01:25:48.824 --> 01:25:50.382
Get out.

1231
01:25:51.326 --> 01:25:52.953
Get out!

1232
01:25:55.997 --> 01:25:57.259
Harry.

1233
01:25:59.668 --> 01:26:00.726
Harry!

1234
01:26:14.216 --> 01:26:16.047
Oh, shit!

1235
01:26:49.618 --> 01:26:52.348
Washington has agreed
that as we have the contacts...


1236
01:26:52.554 --> 01:26:55.819
...that we should undertake
the financing and arming...


1237
01:26:56.057 --> 01:26:57.922
...of the Silent Opposition.

1238
01:26:58.126 --> 01:27:01.721
And it's been agreed that that task
be undertaken by an older hand.


1239
01:27:01.963 --> 01:27:06.491
By myself, in fact. And on
a more formal basis than hitherto.


1240
01:27:07.135 --> 01:27:10.400
I dare say that'll come
as a bit of a relief to you, Andrew.


1241
01:27:10.605 --> 01:27:12.800
Equipping an army, tedious business.

1242
01:27:13.008 --> 01:27:16.000
Not the sort of task
for your mercurial brain.


1243
01:27:16.211 --> 01:27:18.839
Best left to us humble
planners and plodders, eh?


1244
01:27:19.547 --> 01:27:23.916
It's fine in principle, Scotty.
Just one snag.


1245
01:27:24.219 --> 01:27:26.050
They won't talk to anyone but me.

1246
01:27:27.889 --> 01:27:30.357
I think you'll find that,
however shy they are...


1247
01:27:30.592 --> 01:27:32.685
...they'll talk to a candid friend...

1248
01:27:32.928 --> 01:27:35.396
...who has $15 million
to spend on them.


1249
01:27:36.164 --> 01:27:37.791
Wouldn't you say, ambassador?

1250
01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.694
You know, for quite a while
I was skeptical...


1251
01:27:41.903 --> 01:27:45.168
...about this extraordinarily
silent opposition.


1252
01:27:45.373 --> 01:27:50.401
And I always thought that Mickie
Abraxas was just a harmless drunk.


1253
01:27:50.879 --> 01:27:53.040
Funny how wrong you can be.

1254
01:27:54.549 --> 01:27:59.282
Andy may have a real problem conjuring
up one of these people for you.


1255
01:27:59.721 --> 01:28:03.054
Afraid so, Scotty.
You could put it like this:


1256
01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:07.193
If you don't go through me,
there is no Silent Opposition.


1257
01:28:07.395 --> 01:28:09.590
It doesn't do to be too possessive.

1258
01:28:09.798 --> 01:28:13.427
We must be brave and wean them off
the Osnard teat, my boy.


1259
01:28:14.069 --> 01:28:18.472
Might I offer myself
as a go-between, so to speak...


1260
01:28:18.673 --> 01:28:22.302
...to verify Andy's dispersal
of these funds?


1261
01:28:22.911 --> 01:28:25.607
Kind of you to offer, ambassador.
Perhaps so.


1262
01:28:25.814 --> 01:28:28.715
Meanwhile, Andrew can brief me
on the details.


1263
01:28:28.917 --> 01:28:30.851
We have a lot
to catch up on, eh?

1264
01:28:31.052 --> 01:28:34.215
Whiskey till the small hours
in the privacy of your abode...


1265
01:28:34.422 --> 01:28:37.357
...is indicated for Osnard
and Luxmore, I believe.


1266
01:28:39.327 --> 01:28:41.352
- Sure.
- Excellent, gentlemen.


1267
01:28:41.596 --> 01:28:44.827
Andrew, I take it you have
a secure safe in your apartment?


1268
01:28:45.033 --> 01:28:46.523
Absolutely, sir.

1269
01:28:46.801 --> 01:28:47.893
Fort Knox.

1270
01:28:48.103 --> 01:28:49.400
Ambassador.

1271
01:28:49.838 --> 01:28:51.203
I'll get my files.

1272
01:29:01.383 --> 01:29:04.546
- You are getting out, aren't you?
- Possibly.


1273
01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.449
Too early to say.

1274
01:29:07.922 --> 01:29:09.389
You'll have to, won't you?

1275
01:29:09.591 --> 01:29:12.492
I mean, there is no
Silent Opposition, is there?


1276
01:29:13.561 --> 01:29:16.530
- Who told you that?
- You did, just now in the meeting.


1277
01:29:17.832 --> 01:29:19.857
You made it all up, didn't you?

1278
01:29:22.137 --> 01:29:23.968
What are you talking about?

1279
01:29:24.172 --> 01:29:27.403
I think you're the wickedest
human being I've ever met.


1280
01:29:30.712 --> 01:29:32.873
That was the attraction, wasn't it?

1281
01:29:34.082 --> 01:29:35.811
How about a farewell fuck?

1282
01:29:36.251 --> 01:29:37.843
Here in the office.

1283
01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.010
A knee-trembler.

1284
01:29:43.458 --> 01:29:45.858
You know, I think I'm cured.

1285
01:29:47.295 --> 01:29:51.095
Excuse me, Francesca.
A private word with Andrew.


1286
01:29:51.566 --> 01:29:53.090
He's all yours.

1287
01:29:55.970 --> 01:30:00.100
My duty is to inform
the Foreign Office of this...


1288
01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:01.774
...travesty.

1289
01:30:03.244 --> 01:30:04.836
How much is your duty worth?

1290
01:30:06.314 --> 01:30:07.542
- Two million.
- One.


1291
01:30:07.749 --> 01:30:09.273
- One and a half.
- One and a quarter.


1292
01:30:09.484 --> 01:30:10.678
Done.

1293
01:30:11.453 --> 01:30:12.750
Andrew.

1294
01:30:13.221 --> 01:30:14.552
Good night.

1295
01:30:42.617 --> 01:30:47.020
You got a lovely little family, Harry.
Only one thing can spoil it.


1296
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:50.089
- What's that, Uncle Benny?
- The truth, Harry.


1297
01:30:50.291 --> 01:30:51.724
That's the honest truth.

1298
01:30:59.968 --> 01:31:01.492
Esmeralda?

1299
01:31:02.303 --> 01:31:03.292
Esmeralda.

1300
01:31:06.007 --> 01:31:08.567
I'm going out. 
Watch the children.

1301
01:31:09.711 --> 01:31:11.372
Marta!

1302
01:31:17.018 --> 01:31:18.713
Marta!

1303
01:31:32.834 --> 01:31:35.029
Oh, God!

1304
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:37.638
I'm not imposing on you, am I?

1305
01:31:37.839 --> 01:31:40.273
You're not imposing
on me in the least.


1306
01:31:43.444 --> 01:31:44.672
Who the devil's that?

1307
01:31:53.188 --> 01:31:54.678
Buchan 2. We got trouble.

1308
01:31:54.923 --> 01:31:57.585
When I get her into
the other room, get out.


1309
01:31:57.825 --> 01:32:00.123
In the lobby,
give the concierge a dollar.


1310
01:32:00.328 --> 01:32:03.456
He'll get you a taxi to
the El Panama Hotel. Get a room.


1311
01:32:03.665 --> 01:32:05.394
A taxi? At this time of night?

1312
01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:08.433
I don't speak Spanish, Andy.
I'm unarmed.


1313
01:32:08.636 --> 01:32:10.194
Life is cheap here.

1314
01:32:10.405 --> 01:32:13.602
You can handle it.
You're a field man, aren't you?


1315
01:32:14.409 --> 01:32:15.808
What about the bags?

1316
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:18.672
I'll guard them with my life.
Believe me.


1317
01:32:44.505 --> 01:32:45.802
Louisa.

1318
01:32:46.975 --> 01:32:50.433
- Something on your mind?
- What the fuck have you done?


1319
01:32:50.745 --> 01:32:54.442
What is all this bullshit
about Abraxas and Delgado?


1320
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:57.618
Don't worry. It's nothing.
It's crap. It's all a game.


1321
01:32:57.819 --> 01:32:59.446
- Where's Harry?
- Harry's okay.


1322
01:32:59.654 --> 01:33:03.454
- I'm gonna take care of Harry and you.
- Get your fucking hands off me!


1323
01:33:03.691 --> 01:33:05.420
Get off me.

1324
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:10.497
Relax.

1325
01:33:11.199 --> 01:33:13.394
We both know why you're here.

1326
01:33:18.706 --> 01:33:19.968
Yeah.

1327
01:33:20.275 --> 01:33:22.835
Shit! You...

1328
01:33:27.048 --> 01:33:29.380
What have you gotten Harry into?

1329
01:33:29.584 --> 01:33:33.384
Harry got himself into this
with his own ludicrous stories.


1330
01:33:33.821 --> 01:33:38.121
When the Americans take back their
canal, it'll be down to him, not me.


1331
01:33:39.294 --> 01:33:40.283
When?

1332
01:33:41.429 --> 01:33:42.396
When?

1333
01:33:44.732 --> 01:33:46.529
Get out of my way!

1334
01:33:50.204 --> 01:33:51.933
I killed him, Marta.

1335
01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.608
I killed him with my bullshit.

1336
01:33:55.476 --> 01:33:57.774
He said the police were after him.

1337
01:33:57.979 --> 01:33:59.241
He said:

1338
01:34:00.848 --> 01:34:02.839
"Tell Harry I'm sorry."

1339
01:34:03.117 --> 01:34:05.711
And I didn't finish his suit.

1340
01:34:06.554 --> 01:34:09.250
It would've given him
back his dignity.


1341
01:34:09.891 --> 01:34:11.950
He wouldn't have shot himself in it.

1342
01:34:12.193 --> 01:34:14.661
He was always going to do it.

1343
01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:19.828
He was just looking
for a good enough excuse.


1344
01:34:41.055 --> 01:34:42.955
Shall I close his eyes?

1345
01:34:55.737 --> 01:34:57.705
You must go now, Harry.

1346
01:34:59.073 --> 01:35:00.165
Go, Harry.

1347
01:35:22.630 --> 01:35:23.597
Yep.

1348
01:35:23.965 --> 01:35:25.956
Harry, my man, where have you been?

1349
01:35:26.167 --> 01:35:30.365
Louisa was here. I think she thought
I was leading you astray or something.


1350
01:35:33.408 --> 01:35:34.670
Jesus.

1351
01:35:35.743 --> 01:35:37.711
I see. Go on.

1352
01:35:38.212 --> 01:35:40.510
So we have to
stop all this, you hear?

1353
01:35:41.048 --> 01:35:44.643
Mickie knew nothing about it.
You know and I know I made it all up.


1354
01:35:44.852 --> 01:35:47.946
<i>It's too late for that, old boy.
Out of our hands.</i>


1355
01:35:48.589 --> 01:35:51.183
A case of life imitating art.

1356
01:36:06.441 --> 01:36:08.204
Bit of a setback, sir.

1357
01:36:08.409 --> 01:36:10.434
It's Mickie Abraxas.

1358
01:36:10.945 --> 01:36:12.503
Bullet through the head.

1359
01:36:13.514 --> 01:36:14.572
Suicide.

1360
01:36:14.782 --> 01:36:17.979
Setback? Setback? 
On the contrary.

1361
01:36:18.186 --> 01:36:21.678
No, they'll probably claim
he killed himself in police custody.


1362
01:36:21.923 --> 01:36:25.916
That's standard euphemism for
assassinations in regimes of this ilk.


1363
01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.492
No, no one's going
to swallow that one.


1364
01:36:28.696 --> 01:36:29.663
<i>No.</i>

1365
01:36:30.331 --> 01:36:34.358
<i>"Leader of the Democratic Rebel
Movement murdered."</i>


1366
01:36:34.569 --> 01:36:38.505
<i>Yes. I think we could have
the peg we're looking for, Andy.</i>


1367
01:36:38.706 --> 01:36:41.607
<i>I'll inform our American cousins.
Now, tell me...</i>


1368
01:36:41.809 --> 01:36:45.006
<i>... did you manage to resolve
that Buchan 2 situation?</i>


1369
01:36:45.213 --> 01:36:49.445
<i>I got the distinct impression
she was in a state of high anxiety.</i>


1370
01:36:49.650 --> 01:36:54.485
<i>You must impress on your operatives
the importance of staying in control.</i>


1371
01:36:54.722 --> 01:36:55.780
<i>Andrew?</i>

1372
01:37:10.872 --> 01:37:13.898
Hello, is anybody there?
I must talk to the ambassador.


1373
01:37:14.108 --> 01:37:15.166
I'm English.

1374
01:37:15.376 --> 01:37:18.675
It's a matter of grave importance.

1375
01:37:25.453 --> 01:37:28.911
Mickie Abraxas died three hours ago.

1376
01:37:29.123 --> 01:37:32.183
Executed by a government death squad.

1377
01:37:32.827 --> 01:37:35.091
I have informed the president.

1378
01:37:35.296 --> 01:37:37.856
He has authorized us to go on in.

1379
01:37:38.065 --> 01:37:41.592
We have that right under the treaty
if the canal is threatened.


1380
01:37:42.403 --> 01:37:45.395
Operation Straight Arrow
is all yours, general.


1381
01:37:45.606 --> 01:37:47.369
How soon can you be operational?

1382
01:37:47.575 --> 01:37:50.669
- Give me four hours, sir.
- That fast?


1383
01:37:51.112 --> 01:37:54.878
My rapid response units
are on full alert, sir.


1384
01:37:55.082 --> 01:37:58.176
<i>Carrier Alaska is
off the coast of Panama.</i>


1385
01:37:58.386 --> 01:38:01.253
Eight F-22 Raptors are on alert.

1386
01:38:01.489 --> 01:38:04.981
Twelve gunships.
A battalion of marines.


1387
01:38:06.494 --> 01:38:09.793
- I've got to speak to the ambassador.
- The ambassador is busy.


1388
01:38:09.997 --> 01:38:11.897
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

1389
01:38:12.099 --> 01:38:13.589
Ambassador.

1390
01:38:14.101 --> 01:38:16.001
I am Buchan.

1391
01:38:16.304 --> 01:38:20.866
I made it all up. You've got
to stop it. You see, I'm Buchan.


1392
01:38:21.075 --> 01:38:24.044
I'm sorry, but aren't you
that tailor fellow?


1393
01:38:24.245 --> 01:38:25.576
You're rather upset.

1394
01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:28.647
- Nigel, please show the gentleman out.
- Yes.


1395
01:38:28.849 --> 01:38:31.545
There is no Silent Opposition!

1396
01:38:31.752 --> 01:38:34.687
Someone's gotta blow the whistle.
Might as well be me.


1397
01:38:34.922 --> 01:38:38.881
You're a diplomat. Be diplomatic.
Can't interfere at this stage.


1398
01:38:39.126 --> 01:38:41.993
It would reflect very badly.
And what could we say?


1399
01:38:42.196 --> 01:38:47.133
That some deranged tailor Johnny
told us it was all a joke?


1400
01:38:47.335 --> 01:38:48.359
Nevertheless.

1401
01:38:54.308 --> 01:38:56.970
- Darling, what...?
- I need to talk to Ernesto.


1402
01:39:04.518 --> 01:39:05.348
Andy.

1403
01:39:14.595 --> 01:39:15.527
Andy!

1404
01:39:20.668 --> 01:39:21.760
Wait!

1405
01:39:34.415 --> 01:39:35.814
Oh, Harry.

1406
01:39:49.330 --> 01:39:52.128
Well, if the ambassador's
been recalled...


1407
01:39:52.333 --> 01:39:54.733
...give me somebody
who hasn't been recalled.


1408
01:39:54.935 --> 01:39:58.063
His secretary, his butler, his...

1409
01:40:00.141 --> 01:40:01.768
Come with me, Louisa.

1410
01:40:02.843 --> 01:40:04.868
We're going to see the president.

1411
01:40:17.491 --> 01:40:18.958
Shit!

1412
01:40:23.597 --> 01:40:25.497
Oh, no, no, no.

1413
01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:28.134
Come on, come on, come on.

1414
01:41:10.411 --> 01:41:12.345
What the fuck do you want?

1415
01:41:12.546 --> 01:41:17.279
I want you to come back to the embassy
and tell them it's all a mistake!


1416
01:41:18.018 --> 01:41:21.510
Harry, I've got our money here.
Yours and mine.


1417
01:41:21.756 --> 01:41:24.520
I'm trying to get out
before they close the airport.


1418
01:41:24.759 --> 01:41:28.923
I'm going straight to Switzerland.
Open numbered accounts for both of us.


1419
01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:31.824
You'll be a rich man.
Just give me a lift.


1420
01:41:32.032 --> 01:41:34.057
- We're going back.
- Get out of my way!


1421
01:41:34.268 --> 01:41:37.965
- Are you not listening to me?
- Don't be bloody annoying, Harry!


1422
01:41:39.874 --> 01:41:42.707
Shit! They're here.

1423
01:42:05.699 --> 01:42:06.757
Ambassador!

1424
01:42:08.736 --> 01:42:12.832
Will you vouch for me, my credentials?
I need to get on a plane.


1425
01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.634
You wish for this man to be included?

1426
01:42:15.843 --> 01:42:17.811
I've never seen him before.

1427
01:42:20.047 --> 01:42:21.412
Ambassador.

1428
01:42:25.553 --> 01:42:29.614
As you can see, the airport is closed,
but palms have been greased.


1429
01:42:29.857 --> 01:42:34.760
And once our arrangement
has been concluded...


1430
01:42:35.329 --> 01:42:37.297
...you'll be free to go.

1431
01:42:52.847 --> 01:42:57.307
It is a fabrication, Mr. President.
A pack of lies, a travesty.


1432
01:42:57.518 --> 01:43:01.750
The canal is safe, secure.
Unthreatened.


1433
01:43:01.989 --> 01:43:03.957
Call off your dogs, sir.

1434
01:43:04.191 --> 01:43:05.818
Call them off.

1435
01:43:11.498 --> 01:43:13.557
I'll walk you to your plane.

1436
01:43:17.104 --> 01:43:20.073
Could this be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship?


1437
01:43:20.274 --> 01:43:22.936
I think it desperately unlikely.

1438
01:43:27.514 --> 01:43:30.745
<i>Mission aborted. 
Return to base.</i>

1439
01:43:43.831 --> 01:43:44.957
Why?

1440
01:43:45.633 --> 01:43:47.191
I don't know.

1441
01:43:48.936 --> 01:43:50.563
I thought it was a game.

1442
01:43:50.771 --> 01:43:52.705
And behind my back?

1443
01:43:52.907 --> 01:43:55.774
All those lies about
the president and Delgado?


1444
01:43:56.243 --> 01:43:58.677
Oh, yes, the lies.

1445
01:43:59.647 --> 01:44:02.514
I'm very, very sorry about the lies.

1446
01:44:06.587 --> 01:44:07.849
Louisa...

1447
01:44:08.622 --> 01:44:11.284
I never did work
in Savile Row, did I?

1448
01:44:11.525 --> 01:44:12.992
Not as such.

1449
01:44:13.861 --> 01:44:16.159
I learned the tailoring in prison.

1450
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:20.231
I burnt down my Uncle Benny's
warehouse to help him out.


1451
01:44:20.434 --> 01:44:22.459
And then, when I'd done my time...

1452
01:44:23.037 --> 01:44:25.904
...Uncle Benny,
he gives me my portion...


1453
01:44:26.874 --> 01:44:29.638
...sends me out here
so I can't get into trouble.


1454
01:44:30.911 --> 01:44:33.379
I pretended he was Arthur Braithwaite.

1455
01:44:38.852 --> 01:44:41.480
You see, lying's what
you do in prison, Lou.


1456
01:44:42.456 --> 01:44:44.515
It's instead of love, really.

1457
01:44:44.959 --> 01:44:48.690
You tell it the way it should be
since that's better than how it is...


1458
01:44:48.896 --> 01:44:50.329
...when it's that bad.

1459
01:44:50.564 --> 01:44:52.031
If you follow me.

1460
01:44:52.967 --> 01:44:55.663
Why didn't you just tell me
from the start?


1461
01:44:58.405 --> 01:45:01.670
Because I fell in love
with you, my princess.


1462
01:45:04.378 --> 01:45:07.211
And I knew that I wasn't
good enough for you.


1463
01:45:08.749 --> 01:45:10.307
Not as I stood.

1464
01:45:12.953 --> 01:45:15.683
Harry, you are such a fool.

1465
01:45:17.858 --> 01:45:22.318
Dad, you promised to tell me a story.
Where were you?


1466
01:45:23.230 --> 01:45:24.697
Oh, Sarah.

1467
01:45:25.599 --> 01:45:27.157
I'm so sorry.

1468
01:45:29.937 --> 01:45:32.701
No need to cry about it, Dad.

1469
01:45:33.941 --> 01:45:35.135
Hi, Dad.

1470
01:45:35.342 --> 01:45:36.570
Hi, Mum.

1471
01:45:40.214 --> 01:45:42.273
So, what do you want me to do?

1472
01:45:44.618 --> 01:45:46.483
What do I want you to do?

1473
01:45:47.955 --> 01:45:49.547
What you always do.

1474
01:45:54.228 --> 01:45:55.718
Make breakfast.

1475
01:45:59.099 --> 01:46:01.192
Can we have pancakes?

1476
01:46:03.103 --> 01:46:05.128
- Yeah.
- You want pancakes?


1477
01:46:05.806 --> 01:46:07.137
Breakfast?

1478
01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:23.379
Well, there's two ways we can deal
with this one, my dear.


1479
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:24.579
Ready?
