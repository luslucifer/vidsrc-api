¶¶¶

2
00:01:58.253 --> 00:02:01.888
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the London Tombs.


3
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.891
The night has finally arrived
after months of waiting


4
00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:07.093
and you won't believe what
we have in store for you,


5
00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:11.297
but more importantly,
those unlucky few, who will be
walking through those doors.


6
00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.434
Before our guests arrive,
let's take a quick look
at some of the horrors


7
00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:17.370
that lie within the London
Tomb's scare attraction.


8
00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:18.805
¶¶¶

9
00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:24.077
[music box tune]

10
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.279
[screams and laughs]

11
00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:34.420
Oooh. Scary stuff, eh.

12
00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:37.924
This horror location will soon
be seen again on the big screens


13
00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:41.761
for the return of the up
and coming sequel to the
original<i>Tomb</i> 's movie.


14
00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:46.165
As you know tonight, our lead
actors along with some of
their brave celebrity guests,


15
00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:49.836
will soon descend
into the hidden catacombs
beneath our feet


16
00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:51.971
for an unimaginable
night of horror.


17
00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:56.542
Our ghouls are ready,
the ghosts are ready
and more terrifyingly,


18
00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:59.979
our celebrities are ready.

19
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.415
So, there is only one question
left to ask, are you ready?
Because you better be.


20
00:03:04.052 --> 00:03:07.487
Well how did that happen?
And he's not coming out?


21
00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.373
[metallic object dropping]

22
00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:13.258
Be careful with that, it costs
more than your house! Who am I
kidding? You don't own a house.


23
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:17.563
Listen, I'm going to say only
once: solutions, not problems.


24
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:19.532
Go on.

25
00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:21.134
Better not be a problem.

26
00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:26.889
I'm not reading that.

27
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.374
-May I ask why not?
-Because it's awful,
absolutely no understanding


28
00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:31.844
of my character's
motivation whatsoever.


29
00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:35.448
You're a TV presenter,
Harriet, and your
motivation is in the bank.


30
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.251
Oh! I take personal
oence to that and I
refuse to acknowledge it.


31
00:03:38.253 --> 00:03:39.585
Well you sort of just did.

32
00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:46.993
I am a personality.

33
00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:49.428
I am a star.

34
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.201
And I would like to think
after writing for me
for over three seasons


35
00:03:55.203 --> 00:04:00.506
that those typewriter
monkeys would understand
my character.


36
00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:04.477
This is a bit dierent
than filming a two-minute intro
to a midnight movie, darling.


37
00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.547
I don't see how, darling.

38
00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.617
This is a synergized
multimedia event.


39
00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.287
The movie gets publicity,
this place gets publicity,


40
00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.589
the channel gets a scary
new reality TV show,


41
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.992
and you, you get a
primetime audience for once.


42
00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:25.231
Think about it, a weekly
syndicated survival horror
show, with you as the star.


43
00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:28.568
Like, Bear Grylls
without eating the wildlife.


44
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.304
-Aim for the stars!
-And that's why my
character has to be right.


45
00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:35.007
Luckily for you,

46
00:04:35.476 --> 00:04:38.177
I understand my characters'
motivation perfectly.


47
00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:40.379
No improv, Harriet.

48
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:41.480
[grunts]

49
00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:45.518
You're looking beautiful.

50
00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:48.154
Thank you. Champagne.

51
00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:51.257
[cheering]

52
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.393
We're still here outside
the London Tombs.


53
00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:57.597
And some of the great
fans are hoping to get
what might be the last chance


54
00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.198
to see their celebrity favs.

55
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.334
Let's have a word.

56
00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.469
Hi, what are you most hoping
to see our stars face tonight?


57
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:04.570
Bill Piper, Bill Piper!

58
00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:06.639
You're excited, aren't you?

59
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.876
-Yeah, Piper, Piper...
-Piper.


60
00:05:09.878 --> 00:05:11.110
Yeah, okay.

61
00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:14.647
As our countdown nears its end

62
00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.282
let's take the chance to
look at who's already
ventured inside to their fate.


63
00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:23.289
Daytime soap awards
star nominee and star
of The Tombs two, it's Gigi!


64
00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:31.297
You better know him from
his boy band crooning days and
star of the North Star, it's PJ!


65
00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:34.333
Our celebrity sidekick,
Tanya Merryman.


66
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:41.540
Television and acting school
and main state of reality
television, it's Lyle Rourke.


67
00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:43.576
[audience] Lyle, Lyle!

68
00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:47.413
And last, but definitely not
least, your celebrity journalist


69
00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:51.017
and news reporter and
blogger, Doug Smart.


70
00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:52.418
Doug, Doug, Doug...

71
00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:55.288
[Dom] This place
is a fucking maze.


72
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.025
[man] Yeah, they do it
on purpose mate, it's
to disorientate people.


73
00:05:59.027 --> 00:06:01.961
Builds the fear apparently.
It's the whole point of it.


74
00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:07.099
I don't understand why anyone
would let, out of work actors,
chase around the dark for fun.


75
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:09.201
I mean, there's something
wrong with people.


76
00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:11.370
People like to be scared.

77
00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:13.272
It's a thrill.

78
00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:15.007
You're a mug.

79
00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.411
[Dom]<i>Anyway, I didn't</i>
<i>come here to be scared.</i>
<i>I came here to do a job.</i>


80
00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:20.680
[man]<i>Dom?</i>

81
00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:22.615
[voice]<i>Don't be scared,</i>
<i>don't be scared.</i>


82
00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:27.086
To be fair your job is bad, but
not as bad as these fucking two.


83
00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:30.089
-It's not even Halloween yet!
-[guy] All right, all right.


84
00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:33.559
Dickheads.

85
00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.294
I don't know.

86
00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:38.097
I think they're
kind of cute really.


87
00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:39.131
[chuckles]

88
00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:40.333
Give us a sip.

89
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.671
-Ah, I've got
lipstick on it now.
-Give it back here.


90
00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:04.623
<i>You see?</i>

91
00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:05.992
<i>I told you.</i>

92
00:07:05.994 --> 00:07:08.561
There's something
wrong with people.


93
00:07:08.563 --> 00:07:11.464
[chuckles] I take it you
don't watch horror films.


94
00:07:11.466 --> 00:07:14.100
What happened to good
old-fashioned movies
for the whole family?


95
00:07:14.102 --> 00:07:16.335
Listen mate, you know what
you're missing, all right?


96
00:07:16.337 --> 00:07:19.238
The London Tombs, the
first one absolute classic.


97
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.757
Stone cold classic.

98
00:07:21.758 --> 00:07:24.275
A bunch of tourists, they
get trapped in this place
overnight, and then-


99
00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.445
then they get hunted
down by a deranged killer.


100
00:07:26.447 --> 00:07:28.080
Picked o, one by one.

101
00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:30.516
Total, old-school slasher!

102
00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:33.019
Yeah, that sounds great.

103
00:07:35.323 --> 00:07:37.723
Oh, I suppose this is your lad.

104
00:07:37.725 --> 00:07:39.792
<i>The one that does all</i>
<i>the picking and slashing</i>
<i>and god knows what?</i>


105
00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:42.278
<i>Slashing, slashing,</i>
<i>god knows what.</i>


106
00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.763
No, I-- I actually don't
recognize that one.
Must be new for the sequel.


107
00:07:44.766 --> 00:07:47.666
Let's just wrap it up here, eh?
There is a pint somewhere
with my name on it.


108
00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:48.601
You head.

109
00:08:01.049 --> 00:08:02.281
[clears her throat]

110
00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:06.085
That had better
be a glitch, Gary.


111
00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:11.690
Oh, come on, Olivia, what do
you want from me? I'm dealing
with all the technical problems,


112
00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:14.226
what in an underground
scare attraction.


113
00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:16.629
It's hardly wired
for audio visual.


114
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:18.264
So, no problem then.

115
00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:21.600
No problem, just peachy.

116
00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:23.436
[sighing]

117
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.708
-Uh-oh! Star wrangling?
-Character issues.


118
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.777
Problems with the
script apparently.


119
00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:34.080
She's going to improv
it. I just know it.


120
00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:39.218
What, the writing team
couldn't get the right
mixture of tits and clichés?


121
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.753
We've created a monster.

122
00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:43.889
She's more of a-- a minor demon.

123
00:08:46.294 --> 00:08:48.561
I was hoping for
fashionably late.


124
00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:52.431
Well, time to start
clearing out the stragglers.


125
00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:53.833
Well, break a leg.

126
00:08:53.835 --> 00:08:55.367
Fix the cameras.

127
00:08:55.837 --> 00:08:57.136
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.105
[sighing]

129
00:09:02.443 --> 00:09:04.276
-Dom.
-[radio interference]


130
00:09:05.613 --> 00:09:08.914
It's not even started yet and
I'm already getting shivers.


131
00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:12.485
As we're close to kick o
that can only mean one thing.


132
00:09:12.487 --> 00:09:14.854
It's time to introduce
our final guest.


133
00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:18.124
You best know her
as the star of the
original<i>Tomb</i> 's movie,


134
00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:20.793
ready to head back
underground one last time.


135
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.528
It's Piper!

136
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.932
Let's take a look back
at her time in the
original<i>Tombs</i> ' movie.


137
00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:53.492
[engine starting noises]

138
00:09:57.665 --> 00:09:59.298
[engine starting]

139
00:10:01.903 --> 00:10:04.037
Come here. Come here.

140
00:10:04.038 --> 00:10:06.172
-How are you feeling?
-Yeah, yeah.
I'm good thanks.


141
00:10:06.174 --> 00:10:09.942
I'm, you know, really excited
to be here with, with all
the greatest fans!


142
00:10:09.944 --> 00:10:11.710
Um, your fans.

143
00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:14.346
I guess so.

144
00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:16.981
-Nervous?
-Do you know, what I've got
to be honest, I am a little bit.


145
00:10:16.984 --> 00:10:18.584
[Gary]<i>Dom, pick up.</i>

146
00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:25.824
[Dom] Fuck.

147
00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:40.439
[Dom sighing]

148
00:10:43.878 --> 00:10:47.446
I am definitely getting workers
comp over that you, dopey prick.


149
00:10:54.322 --> 00:10:56.622
My scream queen lungs
are ready to go.


150
00:10:56.624 --> 00:10:59.758
-Okay, good. Get yourself
in and good luck.
-Thank you.


151
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.761
Bye! Bye!

152
00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.598
Our fan favorite is in.

153
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.866
Let's hope she can
survive the night.


154
00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:15.307
Okay, don't hold back all
right. This is going on TV.
I need to make an impact.


155
00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:16.976
-Don't worry, you're
going to look great.
-Right.


156
00:11:16.978 --> 00:11:19.345
-Just don't get it
in my eyes, okay?
-All right, all right.


157
00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:24.850
What are you two still
doing here? I called places
fifteen minutes ago.


158
00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:25.818
Get moving.

159
00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:37.730
Finally, a real star.
Well, another one.


160
00:11:37.732 --> 00:11:42.635
-Me?
-Modest too, such a rare
quality in horror royalty.


161
00:11:42.637 --> 00:11:44.003
Well, I wouldn't say that.

162
00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:49.008
I was so worried you
would flake and leave
me here with the B-list.


163
00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:53.612
You know, I've done all the
reality shows back home.


164
00:11:53.614 --> 00:11:57.416
Now days, seems like a
natural career progression.


165
00:11:57.418 --> 00:12:00.886
-Is this your first?
-Yes. It is.


166
00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:01.820
I thought so.

167
00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:03.856
You seem a little stressed out.

168
00:12:03.858 --> 00:12:08.394
-Oh, it's not that.
It's just uh...
-It is a little creepy.


169
00:12:08.996 --> 00:12:12.965
-But this is going to be
fun, don't you think?
-I guess so.


170
00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:16.969
Hell, I was surprised
they talked you
into doing this at all.


171
00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:19.605
-Contractual obligation.
-[laughing]


172
00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:25.160
Funny too, what a delight.

173
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.745
You know, once we're done
here, we really have
to sit down and talk.


174
00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:30.916
I am working on a bunch of
projects that you would love.


175
00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:33.686
Sorry, you're needed.

176
00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:38.390
-Hi!
-Hey, there. I'm-- I'm PJ.


177
00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:39.625
I know who you are.

178
00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:41.126
What gave me away?

179
00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:46.098
I'd have preferred a table
read if I'm being honest.


180
00:12:46.634 --> 00:12:47.599
Me too.

181
00:12:49.804 --> 00:12:53.072
And there we have it, everyone's
in and the doors are locked.


182
00:12:53.074 --> 00:12:55.841
The night is getting dark
and the creeps are
coming out to play.


183
00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:58.877
Stay with us as we venture
down into the Tombs.


184
00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:02.815
But remember, get
comfortable, stay safe and
hold your loved ones tight


185
00:13:02.817 --> 00:13:06.618
because it's not only
things down in the Tombs
that go bump in the night.


186
00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:09.621
[man] And we're out!

187
00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:12.758
Look, I'm not being funny
but how many more
links have I got to do?


188
00:13:13.928 --> 00:13:18.063
So, you know, what-- what's
it like, uh, being back I mean?


189
00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:21.567
Um, it's a little bit strange
if I'm being honest.


190
00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:23.469
It's not really somewhere
I thought I'd be.


191
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:27.573
Oh, come on.
The only last surviving
character from a hit movie.


192
00:13:27.575 --> 00:13:28.841
-Seems like a no brainer to me.
-Ha, ha!


193
00:13:28.843 --> 00:13:31.510
Look what the cat
dragged back in.


194
00:13:31.512 --> 00:13:33.912
-How's the scars?
-Fine, how's the jaw?


195
00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:35.381
Lucrative.

196
00:13:35.383 --> 00:13:37.816
I'm sorry I-- I
missed something.


197
00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:39.051
Must be jet-lagged.

198
00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:44.757
This sorry excuse, arsehole
of a journalist made
quite a name for himself,


199
00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:47.793
-exploiting my personal life.
-And I made a mint.


200
00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:50.513
So, I broke his jaw.

201
00:13:50.514 --> 00:13:52.598
-Is that true?
-Oh yeah, he's an arsehole!


202
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.201
You know what, Piper? I'm
so glad that they didn't kick
the life out of you completely.


203
00:13:56.203 --> 00:13:58.003
Oh no, it's there.

204
00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:00.072
I reserve it for tabloid hacks.

205
00:14:00.074 --> 00:14:03.442
-Anyway, I thought
print was dead.
-Bit like your career, honey.


206
00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:04.710
Why don't you move
on away then, buddy?


207
00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:07.613
I'll be seeing you.

208
00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:10.215
Don't worry about him.

209
00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:12.818
Why don't we go
and get a drink later
after this, you know?


210
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.187
Whose got time
for camera queens?


211
00:14:17.558 --> 00:14:18.190
Oh!

212
00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:22.461
The three stars
finally together.
Ah, this is so exciting!


213
00:14:22.463 --> 00:14:23.495
Okay.

214
00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:29.768
Piper! I am so thrilled
to be working with
a "legend" like you.


215
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.504
Well, it's nice to meet you too.

216
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.690
[voice]<i>Don't be scared.</i>

217
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:56.228
-Dom?

00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:07.139
Dom?

220
00:15:09.176 --> 00:15:10.142
Dom?

221
00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.545
Hello.

222
00:15:18.886 --> 00:15:19.952
Dom?

223
00:15:24.592 --> 00:15:25.724
Help me.

224
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:28.594
Dom!

225
00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:29.995
Dom!

226
00:15:30.798 --> 00:15:31.930
Help me.

[voice]<i>Don't be scared.</i>

228
00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:52.050
[screaming]

229
00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:56.922
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around, please.


230
00:15:57.525 --> 00:15:58.957
That's right, come on.

231
00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:03.195
Thank you everybody
for joining us here tonight,
we appreciate your time.


232
00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:04.930
We'll be kicking o shortly.

233
00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:09.001
Excuse me!

234
00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:11.703
Focus here for a second.

235
00:16:12.206 --> 00:16:13.238
Thank you.

236
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.074
So, I just wanted to run
you through basics.


237
00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:18.210
I would hope your reps have
been through this already,


238
00:16:18.212 --> 00:16:20.245
but I never assume
when it comes to agents.


239
00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:22.714
Each of you have a wristband.

240
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.021
Red is principle cast
and blue is special guests.


241
00:16:29.023 --> 00:16:32.791
At a point during the
proceedings you will be split
up and pit against each other


242
00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:35.060
in a basic challenge.

243
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:37.328
During which the scare
professionals of the production
will pop up at random intervals


244
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:39.598
and boom, give you a scare.

245
00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:41.266
Understood?

246
00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:44.903
Rhetorical question, put
your hand down please.


247
00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.272
Thank you, everybody.

248
00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.346
That went really well.

249
00:16:55.649 --> 00:16:58.317
What are you still
doing here? Fuck off!


250
00:17:03.057 --> 00:17:05.991
Anyway, you go easy on
them tonight, eh, Nicky boy?


251
00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:07.893
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.


252
00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:11.330
Look, I'll catch up with you
later for another cheeky swig.


253
00:17:11.332 --> 00:17:12.798
See you later.

254
00:17:20.908 --> 00:17:21.907
That's new.

255
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:27.379
When you are ready, boys
and girls, it's time to get
this ghost train on the rails.


256
00:17:28.115 --> 00:17:30.082
Harriet, on your mark, please.

257
00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:32.851
[beeping]

258
00:17:32.853 --> 00:17:38.657
Dom, Wayne if you're still
down there it's time to get your
shit together and head on out.


259
00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:45.797
[man]<i>Scare team</i>
<i>ready to go live.</i>


260
00:17:48.035 --> 00:17:51.737
And we're back
in five, four, three.


261
00:17:52.106 --> 00:17:53.338
[cheering]

262
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.377
Welcome back to our long
night of the horrors, live here
from The London Tombs.


263
00:17:58.379 --> 00:18:01.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're ready to begin.


264
00:18:01.382 --> 00:18:04.116
-Are you okay?
-Just nerves.


265
00:18:04.118 --> 00:18:06.118
You don't strike me
as a nervous person.


266
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.754
Don't worry, I'll--
I'll keep you safe.


267
00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:11.123
-Is that so?
-Oh yeah, I'm not
afraid of anything.


268
00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:13.759
Excuse me!

269
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:18.897
Ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls, our spooky six.


270
00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.368
Wait, wait, wait, um.

271
00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:25.671
I didn't think you we're
afraid of anything.


272
00:18:25.673 --> 00:18:27.406
I was just waiting for you.

273
00:18:28.142 --> 00:18:29.675
What's the worst
that can happen?


274
00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:32.010
-What?
-Nothing, something
my agent said.


275
00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:33.712
Oh god.

276
00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:36.782
Eh?

277
00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:38.316
Ah!

278
00:18:40.054 --> 00:18:42.754
-What's your point?
-Piper, my dear.


279
00:18:42.756 --> 00:18:45.057
The London Tombs.

280
00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:47.359
It's the scene of
your greatest triumph.
Your, your brightest day.


281
00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:49.695
-Your...
-I'm not going.


282
00:18:49.697 --> 00:18:51.463
Why not? You've already
signed up for the sequel.


283
00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:53.098
This is early publicity.

284
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.700
I'm not ready for
this kind of event.


285
00:18:54.702 --> 00:18:57.135
It's a closed set, there
is nothing to worry about.


286
00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.705
Seb, you're meant
to be on my side.


287
00:18:59.707 --> 00:19:01.239
What if that crazy
fan comes back?


288
00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.375
Darling, I understand.
Really, I do.


289
00:19:03.377 --> 00:19:08.113
But that was a long time ago,
and the sooner you're working,
the easier it's going to get.


290
00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:11.116
-Do you think I'm not trying?
-No sweetie, I think
you're very trying.


291
00:19:12.753 --> 00:19:15.387
Just kidding.

292
00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:18.022
Please, stop pushing
me to places that
I'm not ready to go to.


293
00:19:18.025 --> 00:19:23.095
Unfortunately, uh, it's not
me doing the pushing, dear.


294
00:19:23.097 --> 00:19:25.530
Contractual obligations.

295
00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:29.735
Forcing people into
compromising situations
since the 1920's.


296
00:19:30.304 --> 00:19:32.504
-So they can sue me?
-They can fire you.


297
00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:35.541
Think about it.

298
00:19:35.542 --> 00:19:37.776
Your future, your independence,
your bank balance.


299
00:19:37.778 --> 00:19:39.044
You mean yours.

300
00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:42.214
A man can't live on
good intentions alone.


301
00:19:42.216 --> 00:19:45.016
You've never had a
good intention in your life.


302
00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:49.154
If the sequel does
as well as the first, it's
seriously good money.


303
00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.524
I suppose I better get
my walking boots on then.


304
00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:53.859
That's my girl.

305
00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:56.495
At least I will have
you with me.


306
00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.763
Oh! I have this ghastly event
with another client across town.


307
00:19:58.766 --> 00:20:02.067
She's actually calling,
uh, a pretty young girl, uh,


308
00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:03.969
-dumb as
a skunk, you know. No.
-Are you being serious?


309
00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:07.072
Press love her, I mean.
At the moment at least.


310
00:20:07.074 --> 00:20:09.441
Un-bloody-believable.

311
00:20:09.443 --> 00:20:11.309
Seriously, you're
going to love it.


312
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:12.978
You're going to--
Thank you, love you.


313
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.547
That's right, you are
about to be a star.


314
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:17.816
Yeah.

315
00:20:17.817 --> 00:20:20.084
Oh, I-- we're going
to have a blast.


316
00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:31.096
-Oh hi, I'm-- I'm PJ.
-Hi! I'm Tanya.


317
00:20:31.098 --> 00:20:34.332
Oh! I've heard
you're a physic.


318
00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:38.103
Wow! Talking to
people's dead relatives.


319
00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:42.207
Do you know how much
of people's life savings
they spend on that horseshit?


320
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.177
I've never charged
a penny to anyone.


321
00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:46.444
Why don't you read my palm?

322
00:20:47.548 --> 00:20:48.947
I don't read palms.

323
00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:49.948
How convenient.

324
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.184
-Everyone in their place?
-Yep.


325
00:20:54.021 --> 00:20:56.822
Uh, why can't I see
any of the scare guys?


326
00:20:57.357 --> 00:20:59.024
That's because
they're all hidden.


327
00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:00.158
That's the point.

328
00:21:00.828 --> 00:21:02.961
Sticking to the shadows.

329
00:21:02.963 --> 00:21:04.462
Whoa!

330
00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:16.341
Come on people,
let a pro lead the way.


331
00:21:27.154 --> 00:21:28.353
[door closing]

332
00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:31.456
[light metallic noises]

333
00:21:42.202 --> 00:21:44.302
I don't think so, pervert.

334
00:21:46.073 --> 00:21:47.505
I bid you welcome.

335
00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:50.108
Oh my god.

336
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.276
That's not funny.

337
00:21:53.347 --> 00:21:57.382
The year was 1665.

338
00:21:57.384 --> 00:22:01.953
Carried on the back of vermin,
fleas spread the devastating


339
00:22:01.955 --> 00:22:05.223
plague through
crowded city streets.


340
00:22:05.225 --> 00:22:10.695
Struck down by this
aiction in numbers vast
enough to defy belief


341
00:22:10.697 --> 00:22:16.368
were dragged from
their homes and dumped
into mass graves.


342
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.639
[screaming and baby
crying in background]


343
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.909
Over three hundred years
later, while excavating the
very place of London Bridge,


344
00:22:24.912 --> 00:22:28.280
-the builders happened
upon a gruesome discovery.
-[background man screaming]


345
00:22:28.282 --> 00:22:33.118
Hundreds of human skeletons
twisting out of the earth,


346
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.255
as if trying to make good their
escape from their earthly tomb.


347
00:22:37.624 --> 00:22:42.327
Some refused to go to work,
fearing sickness, while others


348
00:22:42.329 --> 00:22:44.629
were afraid of the
less physical threat.


349
00:22:44.631 --> 00:22:49.567
From the damned that
they shook loose from
their god forsaken bonds.


350
00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:53.204
When we were finally ready
to open on the tombs to
the public, we had a priest,


351
00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:57.442
concentrate the grounds
to, you know, contain
the restless spirits.


352
00:22:57.444 --> 00:23:03.148
Although and I don't
mean to alarm you, I
was oered no guarantee,


353
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.952
<i>no definite confirmation</i>
<i>that some small...</i>


354
00:23:06.954 --> 00:23:09.654
Oh look, she's using the script.

355
00:23:09.656 --> 00:23:12.057
<i>...festering for</i>
<i>a century still...</i>


356
00:23:12.059 --> 00:23:16.027
The only fucker that
festers here, love, are
the sub-par electronics.


357
00:23:19.366 --> 00:23:24.336
Two teams will enter the pit of
despair with one simple goal.


358
00:23:24.338 --> 00:23:28.473
Concealed into the tomb
below is a skull, one of many.


359
00:23:28.475 --> 00:23:32.310
Now, this skull however, does
not belong to a simple victim.


360
00:23:32.312 --> 00:23:35.013
Rather a man of great evil.

361
00:23:35.015 --> 00:23:38.216
A necromancer who cast
his curse on this place.


362
00:23:38.218 --> 00:23:43.588
The place of his interment
promising to return
and wreck his revenge.


363
00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:45.090
Robert White.

364
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:49.444
-Who?
-Ah!


365
00:23:49.445 --> 00:23:50.628
That will be revealed
in good time.


366
00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:53.365
But for now,
I shall tell you this.


367
00:23:53.367 --> 00:23:56.735
I wish you to find it for me.

368
00:23:56.737 --> 00:23:58.470
It's getting like a game show.

369
00:23:58.472 --> 00:24:01.606
-Yay!
-To the victors, freedom.


370
00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:05.410
To the losers, well,
that would be telling.


371
00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:10.582
A Virgil to your Dante
on your decent to hell.


372
00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:13.251
Now, hurry along.

373
00:24:13.253 --> 00:24:19.624
Time is of the essence and
your fate hangs in the balance.


374
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.430
[background eerie laughter]

[distant chatter]

376
00:24:49.623 --> 00:24:50.522
Fire hazard.

377
00:25:03.303 --> 00:25:07.405
That's going to end up
somewhere very unpleasant if
you don't get it out of my face.


378
00:25:07.407 --> 00:25:08.640
[Doug]<i>Ooh! Is that a promise?</i>

379
00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:13.411
<i>That's better.</i>

380
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:19.784
So, doesn't London Bridge
like go up in the middle
or something?


381
00:25:19.786 --> 00:25:21.152
That's Tower Bridge, hon.

382
00:25:21.154 --> 00:25:22.620
Oh my god, just like the song.

383

388
00:26:22.349 --> 00:26:24.516
Every motherfucking time.

389
00:26:25.452 --> 00:26:26.851
-As our celebrities...
-[cameraman] We're out!


390
00:26:27.888 --> 00:26:29.687
-What?
-Yeah, we're out.


391
00:26:30.157 --> 00:26:32.957
-What the fuck?
-They're saying all
the cameras are out.


392
00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:34.893
-What all of them?
-That's what I'm getting.


393
00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:36.427
They're re-running
the video packages.


394
00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.664
Great, so much for
live TV experience.


395
00:26:39.666 --> 00:26:42.700
I'm trying to get
something out of the
control room, just sit tight.


396
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.257
These are real bones.

397
00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:08.760
You know you'd get
more screen time if you
kept up with the crowd.


398
00:27:08.762 --> 00:27:11.196
Besides, I don't want
to get left behind.


399
00:27:11.198 --> 00:27:13.965
God only knows what
these weirdos do when
the cameras are o.


400
00:27:23.376 --> 00:27:25.460
Oh, my god!

401
00:27:25.461 --> 00:27:27.545
They don't know
what they've done.
This is a huge mistake.


402
00:27:29.015 --> 00:27:29.881
[Lyle] Are you okay?

403
00:27:32.986 --> 00:27:34.519
No, I'm fine.

404
00:27:34.521 --> 00:27:38.223
Then let's go.
I didn't pay for the Hilton
to not be sleeping there.


405
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:51.402
She ain't a physic, you know.

406
00:27:51.404 --> 00:27:55.673
Her crew feeds her
information through an
earpiece, she does all this...


407
00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:58.676
It's all a total put on.

408
00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:03.915
And Gigi, I can tell you
a thing or two about Gigi.


409
00:28:03.917 --> 00:28:06.718
Well, let's just say
she didn't get to where
she is purely on talent.


410
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.554
And just don't get in the way
and her and the spotlight,
if you know what I mean.


411
00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:11.322
Total Tanya Harding type.

412
00:28:12.492 --> 00:28:13.324
Anything?

413
00:28:14.027 --> 00:28:15.893
[cameraman] Total radio silence.

414
00:28:17.664 --> 00:28:20.431
Well, I hope the fans
are enjoying their
extended their ad break.


415
00:28:28.642 --> 00:28:30.975
[Lyle whispering] So, I've
done many reality shows.


416
00:28:30.977 --> 00:28:33.911
This is your first one, so if
I can help you in anyway?


417
00:28:38.852 --> 00:28:41.686
-Having fun?
-You know, I think
you're so brave.


418
00:28:41.688 --> 00:28:43.755
For coming back I mean.

419
00:28:43.756 --> 00:28:45.823
-Oh, whatever you've read I...
-I was talking about the movie.


420
00:28:46.493 --> 00:28:49.661
-Oh!
-I think it's so brave of you
to try to re-launch your career,


421
00:28:49.663 --> 00:28:52.096
in a movie where they're
killing you o so early.


422
00:28:53.566 --> 00:28:55.633
Oh, you didn't know.

423
00:28:55.635 --> 00:28:57.702
I am so sorry.

424
00:28:57.704 --> 00:29:00.104
I guess I just have a better
relationship with the
producers than you.


425
00:29:01.441 --> 00:29:03.841
They're making me the
new face of the franchise.


426
00:29:03.843 --> 00:29:05.843
They're calling it
"The new generation."


427
00:29:06.813 --> 00:29:08.546
Have you even read the script?

428
00:29:10.517 --> 00:29:11.683
Okay.

You see you keep saying
that, but I'm not sure
you know what it means.


437
00:30:50.016 --> 00:30:55.119
I'm already really famous in
LA. I have like over a million
followers on social media.

to ask you, um...

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.464
You're not scared
already, are you?


442
00:31:08.668 --> 00:31:11.836
Something really weird
is happening here.


443

I can feel it.

Listen, I'm a believer.

445
00:31:16.209 --> 00:31:18.443
You can always talk
to me if you need to.

-No.

I'll give them that.

Ooh, it looks like this is
where we are going
our separate ways then.


467
00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:59.203
Sorry, if I upstage
you, but-- you know.

Yeah, the new generation.

No, please wait.

Hey, don't worry, Tanya.

472

Nothing bad is going to
happen. It's just a show.


473
00:34:11.084 --> 00:34:12.883
Exactly, she's already
playing the part.

No, listen to me.

I know there is something
really wrong here.

You're telling me sweetheart.

477
00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:22.994
-Like what?
-I don't know yet, but...


478
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.331
Something, something is moving.

479
00:34:27.333 --> 00:34:29.033
Well, it's not us.

480
00:34:31.037 --> 00:34:34.138
Listen, I know you're scared,
but nothing's going to happen.

It's just a game.

Please, there's something
really wrong here.

You must be careful.

Okay, let's go.

you're scary, you're fear.

Haven't you got anything
better to do than play
with yourself in the dark?

So not funny.

Ah, you dick! Get out of here
man, my bit's coming up.

-Oh my god.

No.

What? Really?

503
00:35:52.885 --> 00:35:56.520
Yeah, they got the CCTV
back, but they can't get
the outside feedback live.


504
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.291
-Oh! What are they going to do?
-Do you really care?


505
00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:06.831
Nah. Good point.
Oi, someone get me a car.


506
00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:09.834
I've got places to be with
alcohol and some people.


507
00:36:13.406 --> 00:36:14.505
[Gary] Watch this.

508
00:36:20.913 --> 00:36:22.546
Well, you know what,
we've got the reaction.


509
00:36:22.548 --> 00:36:24.265
That's all that counts.

510
00:36:24.266 --> 00:36:25.983
Are you serious?
We didn't see anything.

Oh!

516
00:37:17.986 --> 00:37:19.936
If it's going to keep happening,
we need to get it fixed now.


517
00:37:19.939 --> 00:37:22.840
Well, if you can get the boys
on the radio, be my guest.


518
00:37:22.842 --> 00:37:24.308
They're not coming
back to me, are they?


519

Well, you go then.

-Excuse me?
-Go and fix it.


521
00:37:29.115 --> 00:37:30.447
I'm a little bit busy.

522
00:37:31.584 --> 00:37:33.918
Fine! I'll go.

523
00:37:34.253 --> 00:37:35.319
You'll need this.

524
00:37:36.422 --> 00:37:38.622
And don't forget to
use the pointy end.

Woah! Woah!
-Run!

Look, I'm supposed
to be the jittery one.


529
00:37:49.117 --> 00:37:51.634
-What's going on?
-This thing he's huge!
He's just killed someone.


530
00:37:51.637 --> 00:37:53.437
Oh, you can't be serious.

531
00:37:53.439 --> 00:37:55.539
This is a weak attempt
to upstage me.


532
00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:57.641
Go and have a look and
see if there's anything there.


533
00:38:15.161 --> 00:38:17.094
See? Nothing.

534
00:38:18.531 --> 00:38:20.264
It's just a part of the show.

They're just trying
to play on your nerves.

-It's okay.
-Yeah, well it worked.

00:38:26.472 --> 00:38:27.471
Okay.

00:38:28.074 --> 00:38:29.206
Let's go.

539
00:38:29.542 --> 00:38:31.108
Let's get this over
and done with.

542
00:38:59.939 --> 00:39:03.374
Same as before.
Something very powerful here.


543
00:39:05.077 --> 00:39:08.979
The necromancer, the one
that Harriet mentioned upstairs.


544
00:39:09.482 --> 00:39:11.916
I think it's more
than just a story.


545
00:39:11.918 --> 00:39:13.150
I think it's real.

546
00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:16.487
Gather around for
I have a tale to tell.


547

And you're right.

548
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:20.224
He was very real.

I'm not acting.

550
00:39:23.229 --> 00:39:24.228
I...

551
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:28.232
As the plague spread
through the slums of the city,


552
00:39:28.234 --> 00:39:31.468
no one was safe from the
insidious spread of death.


553
00:39:31.737 --> 00:39:36.674
Fearing for their safety, they
turned away from the doctors
that had done little to stop


554
00:39:36.676 --> 00:39:39.543
the flow of chaos.

555
00:39:39.545 --> 00:39:41.645
And looked for a
more arcane remedy.


556
00:39:42.348 --> 00:39:46.183
A wealthy group of citizens
trying to safe their own skin


557
00:39:46.185 --> 00:39:50.220
turned to a man
named Robert White.


558
00:39:51.557 --> 00:39:53.357
Tanya, how did you
know his name?


559
00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:57.161
Specializing

560
00:39:57.162 --> 00:40:00.564
in the dark arts, most
notably communication
with the spirit realm,


561
00:40:00.566 --> 00:40:07.338
White promised these people,
that he could call on this side
to save them and their families.


562
00:40:07.773 --> 00:40:13.310
Although this came at a
price, Robert White was a
deceitful and wicked man.


563
00:40:13.312 --> 00:40:19.249
And before long his
benefactors came to see
their wives and children,


564
00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:23.387
grow sick and die
from the very illness he
promised to keep at bay.


565
00:40:23.389 --> 00:40:25.155
What happened next?

[clock chiming]

Oh, is that the time? You'd
better get on your way.


568
00:40:31.597 --> 00:40:35.366
No please I'm not
playing, I need to know!


569
00:40:35.368 --> 00:40:36.467
Well, what do you know!

570
00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:40.437
Someone who claims
they can speak to the dead
is actually talking shit.


571
00:40:40.439 --> 00:40:43.774
No please, I think
we are in danger here.

doesn't she know who I am?

Stepping all over my lines,
I'm going to call her agent.

I'm going to get
her fucking fired.

Let's see what
she thinks about that.

You, you're in the wrong
place, you're supposed
to be over there.

right? You have one job
and it's fucking easy.

know what the fuck to do?
You're a moving mannequin.

Why aren't you listening to me?
Don't you know who I am?

What don't you
fucking understand?
Get your ass over there.

-What do you say?
-Yeah, sure.


593
00:42:22.374 --> 00:42:26.743
I mean, it just looked so real.

594
00:42:26.745 --> 00:42:28.579
Well, what kind of real?

595
00:42:34.253 --> 00:42:37.387
Oh my god! What happened?

596
00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:40.357
Take it the news didn't, uh,
quit travel across the pond.


597
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.561
I had a run in with a fan
and he figured himself
to be my boyfriend.


598
00:42:44.563 --> 00:42:50.200
And when I didn't feel the same
way he got a little aggressive.


599
00:42:50.836 --> 00:42:54.071
Shit, I'm sorry.

600
00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:57.307
Don't be, I've spent enough
time feeling sorry for
myself and hiding away.


601
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:59.810
This is my big return.

602
00:43:01.347 --> 00:43:03.514
Seems like a bit
of an odd choice.


603
00:43:03.516 --> 00:43:05.549
Yeah, I'm starting
to think that myself.


604
00:43:05.551 --> 00:43:11.822
Although, not as odd as
a claustrophobic entering
an underground tomb.

You're what?

606
00:43:14.526 --> 00:43:15.559
Sounds like the start
of a bad joke, huh?

00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:20.864
-I thought you said
nothing scared you?
-Well not nothing.


608
00:43:20.866 --> 00:43:23.500
Why would they leave
a script lying around?


609
00:43:23.502 --> 00:43:25.502
Perhaps they missed their cue.

610
00:43:25.504 --> 00:43:27.171
Or it's a clue.

611
00:43:27.172 --> 00:43:28.839
Oh no wait, nope, never
mind it's not for us.


612
00:43:30.576 --> 00:43:32.910
-So, what do we do?
-Stay here, I guess.


613
00:43:32.912 --> 00:43:34.912
Fuck that!
We should get going.


614
00:43:34.914 --> 00:43:36.580
Don't want the other team
to find the skull before us.


615
00:43:36.982 --> 00:43:39.383
-Seriously.
-Winners get top billing.


616
00:43:43.789 --> 00:43:44.955
Okay.

617
00:43:54.533 --> 00:43:56.500
What, what's so scary
about this place?


618
00:43:59.505 --> 00:44:01.655
[Lyle] Maybe it's just me.

619
00:44:01.656 --> 00:44:03.806
Yeah, not exactly
the most exciting footage
I've ever filmed.


620
00:44:03.809 --> 00:44:04.875
Quiet.

621
00:44:06.212 --> 00:44:07.511
I'm getting something.

622
00:44:07.513 --> 00:44:09.580
Oh, come on give it up.

623
00:44:10.316 --> 00:44:11.682
You have to listen to me.

624
00:44:11.684 --> 00:44:13.450
No, I don't.

625
00:44:13.452 --> 00:44:17.287
There's something
supernatural at work here.


626
00:44:17.289 --> 00:44:22.392
The only thing that's at work
here is your ridiculous
overactive imagination.


627
00:44:22.394 --> 00:44:24.561
Something evil.

628
00:44:24.563 --> 00:44:25.729
From a misguided childhood.

629
00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:28.332
I know what I'm talking about!

630
00:44:28.334 --> 00:44:31.501
-You're not going to buy
into this shit, are you?
-Well, I don't know.


631
00:44:31.503 --> 00:44:33.737
She did know who
that Robert guy was.


632
00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:37.474
-How do you explain that?
-Mm-mmm, she read the script.


633
00:44:37.476 --> 00:44:39.643
Well, yeah.
I guess, that could be.


634
00:44:39.644 --> 00:44:41.811
Do you know what?
You two wait here.
I'm o to find the others.


635
00:44:41.814 --> 00:44:43.480
What the fuck!

636
00:44:43.482 --> 00:44:47.417
-Oh! Oh my god!
What happened to you?
-You need to help.


637
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.253
Right, we need
to get out of here.


638
00:44:49.255 --> 00:44:50.787
Yeah, okay, fella. Good stu.

639
00:44:50.789 --> 00:44:52.889
He's going to come, he--
he will come for us all.


640
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:54.591
Who? Who is coming?

641
00:44:54.593 --> 00:44:58.295
Oh, knock it o love, if you'll
excuse me, I'm leaving.


642
00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:00.464
I wouldn't if I were you.

643
00:45:00.466 --> 00:45:02.432
Yeah well, you're not me.

644
00:45:02.434 --> 00:45:03.834
See you later.

645
00:45:04.403 --> 00:45:05.802
Don't leave us!

646
00:45:15.381 --> 00:45:17.948
So, this is a hallway
of nightmares.


647
00:45:19.485 --> 00:45:20.917
[baby crying]

648
00:45:20.919 --> 00:45:23.387
Definitely, fucking
nightmares. Okay.


649
00:45:23.389 --> 00:45:25.656
Claustrophobia and dolls.

650
00:45:25.658 --> 00:45:27.324
I said almost nothing.

651
00:45:33.899 --> 00:45:35.365
[PJ] Almost nothing.

652
00:45:39.972 --> 00:45:41.805
Oh, shit.

653
00:45:43.542 --> 00:45:45.075
Oh, this isn't right.

654
00:45:46.745 --> 00:45:49.513
Where the fuck am I?

655
00:46:02.928 --> 00:46:05.462
-Ladies first.
-Oh, man up.


656
00:46:09.468 --> 00:46:10.500
You all right?

657
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.437
Still can't believe you
signed up for this?


658
00:46:13.439 --> 00:46:16.573
-A job's a job, right?
-Mm-hmm.


659
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:21.478
-You don't think they'd, let
me go around, do you?
-I wouldn't count on it.


660
00:46:24.817 --> 00:46:26.416
Oh, for f...

661
00:46:31.623 --> 00:46:33.090
What the...

662
00:46:38.664 --> 00:46:40.030
What the f...

663
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.474
-I found it!
-Fuck!


664
00:46:54.747 --> 00:46:55.979
See, I found it!

665
00:46:58.751 --> 00:47:00.717
Ooh, interesting.

666
00:47:00.719 --> 00:47:02.085
[Piper] What does it say?

667
00:47:05.991 --> 00:47:10.961
"A warning to any
intrepid explorer who
finds this accursed skull."


668
00:47:12.698 --> 00:47:13.630
Ooh.

669
00:47:13.632 --> 00:47:20.670
"A curse will fall on those
that seek to remove it from
this, it's final resting place.


670
00:47:20.672 --> 00:47:24.808
Robert White will rise from
hell to seek his revenge.


671
00:47:25.177 --> 00:47:26.410
Go back.

672
00:47:27.012 --> 00:47:28.745
Go back from whence you came."

673
00:47:30.649 --> 00:47:31.481
[chuckles]

674
00:47:37.956 --> 00:47:39.222
Terrifying.

675
00:47:40.759 --> 00:47:41.658
It's plastic.

676
00:47:42.661 --> 00:47:43.493
Heads up!

677
00:47:45.597 --> 00:47:49.499
-So, does that mean
we can go now?
-Sure hope so.


678
00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:04.581
What the hell? I didn't
authorize that costume.


679
00:48:14.493 --> 00:48:17.227
It is fucking, fucking real!

680
00:48:17.229 --> 00:48:19.796
What the fuck you staring at?
Let's get the fuck out of here.


681
00:48:19.798 --> 00:48:21.632
What happened,
what did you see?


682
00:48:21.633 --> 00:48:23.467
Fuck knows, but I'm not
hanging around to see it again.


683
00:48:26.738 --> 00:48:28.538
-Oh!
-Stupid bitch.


684
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.874
-Are you all right?
-We've got to go, he's coming.


685
00:48:30.876 --> 00:48:34.077
-Who's coming?
-Him. He's huge.


686
00:48:34.646 --> 00:48:36.913
-What the hell is going on?
-Uh, there's a stairwell.


687
00:48:36.915 --> 00:48:39.583
Look, I've got
the skull, I've won.


688
00:48:39.585 --> 00:48:41.651
Just shut up, Gigi!

689
00:48:41.653 --> 00:48:44.554
-Will someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?
-Oh!


690
00:48:53.665 --> 00:48:55.499
Well, that was a bit much.

691
00:48:56.068 --> 00:48:57.534
Gigi, come on.

692
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:15.886
Fuck!

693
00:49:16.522 --> 00:49:17.587
[Tanya] Help!

694
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:19.022
Forget it. It's no good.

695
00:49:20.592 --> 00:49:24.160
-Help!
-Forget it. It's no good.


696
00:49:24.162 --> 00:49:26.363
Well what do you suggest?

697
00:49:26.364 --> 00:49:28.565
I suggest we head back,
walk into the entrance,
straight into the lobby.


698
00:49:28.567 --> 00:49:29.966
You want to listen
to this asshole?


699
00:49:31.169 --> 00:49:33.136
You're going to be
walking straight into him.


700
00:49:33.138 --> 00:49:35.889
Excuse me.

701
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.641
But if this so-called gift of
yours has given you any
information whatsoever,


702
00:49:38.644 --> 00:49:40.777
then I suggest you might
want to share it with us.


703
00:49:40.779 --> 00:49:43.914
He's out there and
he is waiting for us.


704
00:49:43.916 --> 00:49:45.271
She's right.

705
00:49:45.272 --> 00:49:46.627
There is a fucking
maniac on the loose


706
00:49:46.628 --> 00:49:47.983
and you want to take advice
from an ex-mental patient?


707
00:49:47.986 --> 00:49:49.953
What do you mean
ex-mental patient?


708
00:49:49.955 --> 00:49:52.856
Ask her yourself,
a real fruitcake.


709
00:49:57.863 --> 00:50:00.030
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, right.


710
00:50:00.031 --> 00:50:02.198
If you look here, there's the
stairwell that's where she's
heading, that's our way out.


711
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.301
Look, this is obviously
just part of the show.


712
00:50:04.303 --> 00:50:06.636
I mean, it's got to be a trick.
We've already found this.


713
00:50:09.308 --> 00:50:12.809
Okay, if you look there, there's
the stairway that connects
there and that's how we get out.


714
00:50:12.811 --> 00:50:13.777
Let's go.

715
00:50:14.212 --> 00:50:15.111
But...

716
00:50:22.688 --> 00:50:23.720
Holy shit!

717
00:50:24.823 --> 00:50:26.473
-Anything?
-Nothing.


718
00:50:26.474 --> 00:50:28.124
Right, we must have
gone the wrong way
because if you look here...


719
00:50:28.126 --> 00:50:29.626
[Gigi] This is ridiculous.

720
00:50:29.628 --> 00:50:30.794
[Piper] Excuse me?

721
00:50:30.796 --> 00:50:32.729
This is ridiculous.

722
00:50:32.731 --> 00:50:35.182
This is all just
part of the show,


723
00:50:35.183 --> 00:50:37.634
and I'm not going to let you
use this as an excuse
to steal my limelight.


724
00:50:37.636 --> 00:50:39.402
Unbelievable.

725
00:50:39.404 --> 00:50:41.838
-Thank you.
-That is not a compliment.


726
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.740
Stop, stop it.
We need to work together.


727
00:50:43.742 --> 00:50:46.042
You know what I need
to do right now is show
those people out there


728
00:50:46.044 --> 00:50:48.662
what they really want to see.

729
00:50:48.663 --> 00:50:51.281
-People are dying!
-Oh my god, you are
as dumb as you look.


730
00:50:51.283 --> 00:50:54.684
You know what? If you two
want to go on, running on
home then go, but not...


731
00:50:54.686 --> 00:50:56.720
No, no, no! You stay here!

732
00:50:56.722 --> 00:50:59.990
Hell, with that! I'm going
to do what I do best.


733
00:50:59.992 --> 00:51:01.758
I'm going to be a star.

734
00:51:15.841 --> 00:51:18.975
Oh shit!

735
00:51:19.945 --> 00:51:21.077
Mother fucker.

736
00:51:22.948 --> 00:51:24.214
Run!

737
00:51:24.216 --> 00:51:25.048
No.

738
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.716
I've got this. Get out.

739
00:51:32.424 --> 00:51:34.457
[Doug] Shit. Oh, shit.

740
00:51:40.766 --> 00:51:42.198
What the fuck am I doing?

741
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:34.017
Unbelievable.

742
00:52:41.827 --> 00:52:43.193
Fucking brilliant.

743
00:53:03.181 --> 00:53:05.014
Fuck!

744
00:53:16.128 --> 00:53:17.060
[Piper] Move!

745
00:53:17.062 --> 00:53:17.927
[PJ] Hey, buddy.

746
00:53:17.929 --> 00:53:20.196
Yep, d-- don't mind me.

747
00:53:22.768 --> 00:53:24.067
[Piper] It's locked.

748
00:53:24.803 --> 00:53:26.787
Fuck.

749
00:53:26.788 --> 00:53:28.772
-Have you got
any cell reception?
-[Doug] Nothing.


750
00:53:28.774 --> 00:53:30.907
[Piper] I've got a
bar on my Wi-Fi.


751
00:53:44.122 --> 00:53:45.889
[cell phone ringing]

752
00:53:59.604 --> 00:54:00.870
Surely.

753
00:54:04.142 --> 00:54:05.375
Oh, shit.

754
00:54:06.278 --> 00:54:07.577
I think that's the Wi
-Fi.

755
00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:09.913
Fuck!

756
00:54:13.819 --> 00:54:14.951
Thanks for that.

757
00:54:26.498 --> 00:54:27.363
Where's Lyle?

758
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.566
He saved me.

759
00:54:31.369 --> 00:54:33.236
Which one is it?

760
00:54:34.372 --> 00:54:35.538
Oh, Christ!

761
00:54:37.075 --> 00:54:38.541
This is from the seventies.

762
00:54:38.543 --> 00:54:39.509
Jesus!

763
00:54:39.978 --> 00:54:41.144
Robert White.

764
00:54:41.613 --> 00:54:43.913
But that...
That was just a story.


765
00:54:43.915 --> 00:54:45.648
But one based in truth.

766
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:47.584
Look, he cursed this place.

767
00:54:47.586 --> 00:54:51.087
He made a promise to rise
from the dead and rised he has.


768
00:54:51.089 --> 00:54:54.123
So, what? He's like a--
a zombie or something?


769
00:54:54.526 --> 00:54:56.526
No, a spirit.

770
00:54:56.527 --> 00:54:58.527
It's taken on a form
with no energy of its own.


771
00:54:59.431 --> 00:55:00.663
Nothing to resist it.

772
00:55:00.665 --> 00:55:03.299
This is horse shit.

773
00:55:04.202 --> 00:55:05.902
He was weak at first.

774
00:55:05.904 --> 00:55:08.671
But he is getting
stronger with every kill.


775
00:55:08.673 --> 00:55:11.140
Closer and closer
to what he really wants.


776
00:55:11.142 --> 00:55:14.310
-And what is it that
he really wants?
-A host.


777
00:55:15.046 --> 00:55:17.413
Human flesh and blood
to carry his spirit.


778
00:55:17.415 --> 00:55:18.414
And then?

779
00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:20.383
Then we can leave this place.

780
00:55:20.385 --> 00:55:23.453
-And God help us!
-[Piper] So, what
do we do now then?


781
00:55:23.455 --> 00:55:26.189
Well, we stay here, right?

782
00:55:26.191 --> 00:55:27.957
I thought you were
claustrophobic.


783
00:55:27.959 --> 00:55:30.360
Lesser of two evils.

784
00:55:30.362 --> 00:55:34.697
Yeah well, I-- I-- I for one
might be incapable of moving.


785
00:55:39.037 --> 00:55:40.536
What are you-- uh,
what are you doing?


786
00:55:42.607 --> 00:55:43.606
No.

787
00:55:47.479 --> 00:55:49.679
Hold it closed.

788
00:56:23.281 --> 00:56:24.614
Oh, fuck it.

789
00:56:24.616 --> 00:56:25.748
I give up.

790
00:56:26.284 --> 00:56:27.617
Fucking had enough of it.

791
00:56:35.093 --> 00:56:38.361
-Well, now what?
-We wait here obviously.


792
00:56:38.363 --> 00:56:39.529
Dumb arse.

793
00:56:40.198 --> 00:56:42.265
-Run?
-[Doug] This is ridiculous.


794
00:56:42.267 --> 00:56:45.134
-Are you fucking thick?
-You want to carry your own ass?


795
00:56:45.136 --> 00:56:49.205
-Ignore me I-- I-- I-- I'm in
considerable amount of pain.
-Shut up, man.


796
00:56:49.207 --> 00:56:51.074
No. He'll be back.
He knows we are here.


797
00:56:51.076 --> 00:56:53.609
He won't give up
that easily, he needs us.


798
00:56:53.611 --> 00:56:56.612
And where is he, if he
needs us so bloody badly?


799
00:56:59.084 --> 00:57:00.049
Where is Gigi?

800
00:57:03.621 --> 00:57:06.723
<i>Is this what you want?</i>
<i>Is this what you're after?</i>


801
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:12.161
Shit, we-- we have to help
her. We have to find her.


802
00:57:12.163 --> 00:57:13.763
We can't fight him like that.

803
00:57:13.765 --> 00:57:17.166
-Then how?
-Something is holding
him to this place.


804
00:57:17.168 --> 00:57:19.469
Something that allows
his spirit to remain.


805
00:57:19.471 --> 00:57:22.171
Oh, brilliant yeah.
We're back to this
nonsense again.


806
00:57:22.707 --> 00:57:23.539
What is it?

807
00:57:24.609 --> 00:57:25.675
A skull.

808
00:57:25.677 --> 00:57:26.776
It's plastic.

809
00:57:26.778 --> 00:57:28.745
Not that one.

810
00:57:28.746 --> 00:57:30.713
The way we came in,
one of the skulls on the wall.


811
00:57:31.282 --> 00:57:35.385
I believe if we destroy
this skull, we destroy
the connection.


812
00:57:35.387 --> 00:57:38.121
Well fuck it, at least
it's the way out.


813
00:57:38.123 --> 00:57:39.789
You're going to
have to guide us.


814
00:57:43.094 --> 00:57:44.427
Oh, it's you.

815
00:57:45.063 --> 00:57:48.031
Look. You may have all the
others fooled, but not me.


816
00:57:48.033 --> 00:57:49.198
But don't worry.

817
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.833
I'm willing to play along.

Oh, my god mister.

Please don't kill me.

Oh, not the axe.

Sounds like they are
having fun down there.

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.605
Not for me.

831
00:58:29.607 --> 00:58:31.607
Ooh, this is the one for me.

832
00:58:32.177 --> 00:58:34.310
Ah, that's my baby.

833

Yeah? I've been hurt before
and it ain't happening again.

Fair enough.

up your pony tail.
-Shut the fuck up.

Quickly, he's getting closer.

Run.

01:10:40.871 --> 01:10:41.870
Well,

926
01:10:43.207 --> 01:10:45.040
I'm not going to make
it to the end credits.


927
01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:49.244
No.

928
01:10:51.282 --> 01:10:52.815
I'm done.

929
01:10:54.952 --> 01:10:59.888
I um, guess you'll have to
have that drink on your own.


930
01:11:04.061 --> 01:11:07.563
My final girl.

931
01:12:12.563 --> 01:12:14.930
Woah, woah, woah,
woah! Help me.


932
01:12:14.932 --> 01:12:16.431
Just wait, I've just got
to check this door!


933
01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:21.503
I am still alive! As
unbelievable as it may seem.


934
01:12:23.007 --> 01:12:24.673
-[Doug] Help me!
-Wait!


935
01:12:28.045 --> 01:12:29.077
The others?

936
01:12:33.484 --> 01:12:35.584
That is one hell of an article.

937
01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.990
I need to get this door open,
because he's coming
and that won't hold him.


938
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.393
I think he's already here.

939
01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:02.711
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!


940
01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:07.015
Kill her, not me.

941
01:13:07.418 --> 01:13:08.650
Please!

942
01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:10.719
I'm too smart to die.

943
01:13:12.323 --> 01:13:13.588
Fuck!

944
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:18.260
[distorted voice]
Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!


945
01:13:31.642 --> 01:13:33.742
Come on then, you bastard!

946
01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:49.758
Oh, fuck.

[Doug] Woah, Piper.

950
01:15:34.231 --> 01:15:37.299
You are a fucking legend.

951
01:15:37.301 --> 01:15:39.334
I take it all back.

952
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:42.437
Ah, Jesus.

953
01:15:44.408 --> 01:15:46.141
No hard feelings, eh.

954
01:15:48.779 --> 01:15:50.812
I got here to talk, so...

955
01:15:55.185 --> 01:15:56.818
What are you doing?

956
01:15:57.421 --> 01:15:58.687
I apologized.

957
01:15:59.823 --> 01:16:01.723
I said I was-
- Don't be stupid.

958
01:16:01.725 --> 01:16:05.260
I sai-- I sai--
I said I was sorry.
