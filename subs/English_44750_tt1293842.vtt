THAT SOUNDS
REALLY BORING.

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.853
OK. UM...BEFORE

00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:25.131
HE'S BUILT SUCH
A GOOD PROGRAM

40
00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:28.873
NO, NO, NO. I WANT YOU

41
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.875
NO. HEY, HEY, HEY.
WELL, WAIT, WAIT.


42
00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.052
WE GOT A GREAT TEAM.
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THEM.


43
00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:34.183
OK? THEY'RE FANTASTIC.

44
00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:35.793
MY DAUGHTER'S
ON THE TEAM--TAMRA.


45
00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:37.752
SHE'S HUGE,
BIG AS AN OX.


46
00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.884
SHE'S GOT HUGE HANDS,
LIKE HER MOM.


47
00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:41.538
I DON'T KNOW, TERRY.
THAT'S...


48
00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:43.410
ALL RIGHT. LOOK.

50
00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.545
ALL OF THEM. I HAD TO
JUMP THROUGH ALL OF THEM.


51
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.199
I APPRECIATE THAT,
TERRY,


52
00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:52.636
BUT I CAN'T
COACH GIRLS.


53
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.725
WOMEN HATE ME.
YOU KNOW THAT.


54
00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.208
YEAH. OK. WELL...
THEN JUST STAY HERE


55
00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:02.168
AND WASH DISHES
AND EAT OTHER PEOPLE'S FOOD


56
00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:05.693
AND, YOU KNOW...
ENJOY THAT.


57
00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:06.781
IT'S NOT SO BAD, YOU KNOW.

58
00:03:06.824 --> 00:03:08.130
I HAVEN'T GOT A LOT
OF RESPONSIBILITY.


59
00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:13.701
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE'S NO
RESPONSIBILITY.


60
00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:15.616
SPREADING
THE LOVE AROUND.


61
00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.401
CAN YOU HOLD THAT
FOR 2 SECONDS?


62
00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:20.186
I QUIT.

63
00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.665
YOU WANT TO
GO OUT WITH ME?


64
00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.102
I'M MARRIED.

65
00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:25.495
ALL RIGHT. FORGET IT.

66
00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.933
I'M TAKING BOBBY WITH ME.

67
00:03:29.717 --> 00:03:33.460
WHO'S BOBBY?

68
00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:37.855
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

69
00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.902
COME ON, BOBBY.
LET'S GO.


70
00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:44.819
WE'RE GOING TO
GET YOU OUT OF HERE.


71
00:03:44.862 --> 00:03:47.822
HAVE A GOOD MEAL.

72
00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.913
I HEARD THEY FINALLY
HIRED A NEW COACH.


73
00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:53.001
OH, YEAH?

74
00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:54.568
GUESS WHO IT IS.

00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:56.048
UH...PHIL JACKSON?

00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:57.397
BILL GREAVES.

77
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.528
WHO'S THAT?

78
00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.095
REMEMBER THAT GUY
WHO USED TO COACH


79
00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.966

OVER IN CULVER?


80
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.880
UH...NO.

81
00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:04.056
REMEMBER,
HIS ENTIRE TEAM QUIT


82
00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.362
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SECTIONAL FINALS?


83
00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:07.581
SO WHY'D THEY HIRE HIM?

84
00:04:07.624 --> 00:04:09.670
HE'S PROBABLY
THE ONLY GUY
THEY COULD GET.


85
00:04:09.713 --> 00:04:11.454
WE SHOULD JUST
QUIT RIGHT NOW.


86
00:04:11.498 --> 00:04:13.500
SHUT UP, MINDY.
YOU CAN'T EVEN PLAY.


87
00:04:13.543 --> 00:04:15.850
YOU SHUT UP.
NEITHER CAN YOU.


88
00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:17.112
I HEAR HE HAS PROBLEMS.

89
00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.419
HIS TEAM MADE IT
TO THE SECTIONAL
FINALS, OK?


90
00:04:19.462 --> 00:04:22.726
HE MUST BE GOOD.

91
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.685
HEY.

92
00:04:24.728 --> 00:04:27.514
YOU CAN GO NOW.

93
00:04:29.037 --> 00:04:30.865
LISA, ARE YOU
KIDDING?


94
00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:32.432
WHAT IS
YOUR DAMAGE?


95
00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:33.650
NOTHING.
I JUST DON'T SEE


96
00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:35.217
WHY THEY ALL HAVE TO
KEEP MOVING HERE.


97
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:37.350
YOU DO REALIZE
YOU'RE BLACK, RIGHT?


98
00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:38.742
OBVIOUSLY.

99
00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:40.614
WELL, OUR DAD SAYS
THAT IF WE DIDN'T
HAVE ILLEGALS


100
00:04:40.657 --> 00:04:42.006
TO WORK
THE FACTORIES,


101
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.878
THE COUNTRY'S ENTIRE
INFRASTRUCTURE
WOULD COLLAPSE.


102
00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:45.706
YOUR DAD SOUNDS
LIKE A PUSSY.
HE IS.


103
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.012
HASN'T OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

WHO IS SHE TALKING TO?


107
00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:53.888
I DON'T KNOW.

108
00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:55.368
SOME GUY SHE MET
AT SHOES ETC.
LAST WEEKEND.


109
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:56.412
WHAT GUY?

110
00:04:56.456 --> 00:04:57.979
HE HAS A MUSTACHE.

111
00:04:58.022 --> 00:04:59.154
GROSS. WHY DOES SHE
ALWAYS GO AFTER GUYS
WITH FACIAL HAIR?


112
00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.113
I KNOW. RIGHT?
IT'S SO DISGUSTING.


113
00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:02.679
IT'S LIKE KISSING
YOUR DAD.


114
00:05:02.723 --> 00:05:04.942
OK. YOU JUST TAKE IT
TO A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL


115
00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:06.770
THAT IS REALLY
UNNECESSARY.

THOSE GIRLS, THEY
DON'T EVEN LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE IN SHAPE.


134
00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:38.601
WELL, THE GIRLS PROGRAM,
