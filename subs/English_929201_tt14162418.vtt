charge in over 100 years.


469
00:32:54.237 --> 00:32:55.807
And if you ride a horse
into battle,


470
00:32:55.939 --> 00:32:57.675
then I'm Peter Frikkin' Pan.

471
00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:01.278
We're gonna get you
some righteous boots, soldier.


472
00:33:01.411 --> 00:33:04.515
'Cause those feet are gonna
carry you into battle.


473
00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:06.717
- Do you understand this?
- Yes, drill sergeant!


474
00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:09.554
Yeah, I know, but have you
seen or heard from her?


475
00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:13.256
[Bo] <i>We've not seen her</i>
<i>since she left last week.</i>


476
00:33:14.324 --> 00:33:16.594
She came by the ranch and...

477
00:33:16.727 --> 00:33:19.162
she didn't have much
to say, but...


478
00:33:20.163 --> 00:33:21.833
<i>She cried like a baby</i>
<i>when she left.</i>


479
00:33:21.965 --> 00:33:24.735
<i>Casey, you gotta trust</i>
<i>the Lord with these things.</i>


480
00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:26.471
You got to focus.

481
00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.438
You're about
to stand the wall.


482
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.675
Yes, sir.

483
00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:32.275
Okay.

484
00:33:32.409 --> 00:33:34.512
All right.
We love you, son.


485
00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:35.979
Bye bye.

486
00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:45.055
Good morning, gentlemen.

487
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.926
I'm Sergeant Major Spencer.

488
00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.896
Welcome you to the fifth
Special Forces Group.


489
00:33:52.062 --> 00:33:53.263
Congratulations.

490
00:33:53.396 --> 00:33:55.365
You completed
qualification training,


491
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.802
made it through our
training pipeline.


492
00:33:57.935 --> 00:33:59.102
A lot of people try it.

493
00:33:59.236 --> 00:34:00.538
A lot of people
don't pull it off.


494
00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:02.172
So you got that one
under your belt.


495
00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:04.274
But let me tell you this:

496
00:34:04.407 --> 00:34:05.943
you trained to get here.

497
00:34:06.076 --> 00:34:07.645
You're gonna train
to stay here,


498
00:34:07.778 --> 00:34:11.114
every hour, every day.

499
00:34:11.248 --> 00:34:13.016
We are training
and we are learning,


500
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:14.852
or we're not doing our jobs.

501
00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:17.053
- Roger?
- Roger.


502
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.525
Here at Second Battalion,
we're going to emphasize


503
00:34:20.658 --> 00:34:24.094
foreign internal defense
and unconventional warfare.


504
00:34:24.227 --> 00:34:27.999
We are gonna become
masters at infiltration,


505
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:29.366
link up operations

506
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.434
with guerillas and
guerrilla chiefs,


507
00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:34.104
learning from them,
building rapport,


508
00:34:34.237 --> 00:34:36.574
using what we learn
to lead guerrilla forces


509
00:34:36.707 --> 00:34:39.510
anywhere in our
area of operations.


510
00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:40.511
That is the goal.

511
00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.780
[gunfire]

512
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.552
Roll him, roll him!

513
00:34:47.685 --> 00:34:50.387
- Roll him over!
- Roll him!


514
00:34:57.227 --> 00:34:59.362
[shouting]

515
00:35:08.071 --> 00:35:09.574
Look to your left
and your right.


516
00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:13.276
That is our most
important asset,


517
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.312
is the Special Forces soldier.

518
00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:16.847
The man next to you.

519
00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:20.585
You will be each
other's savior...


520
00:35:22.486 --> 00:35:24.120
and ally at all times.

521
00:35:24.254 --> 00:35:27.525
So, Staff Sergeant
Casey Shane...


522
00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.528
meet your new guys.

523
00:35:32.128 --> 00:35:33.497
Take care, gentlemen.

524
00:35:35.365 --> 00:35:38.069
So, you mean to tell me
you're a cowboy?


525
00:35:38.201 --> 00:35:40.571
- Like, a real cowboy?
- Yes, sir.


526
00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:43.139
Boots, hat, horses--
that type of cowboy?


527
00:35:43.273 --> 00:35:46.142
Or you playing football
in Dallas?


528
00:35:46.276 --> 00:35:48.579
- No, I rode bulls.
- Okay.


529
00:35:50.313 --> 00:35:53.084
Ohh.
How big is your ranch?


530
00:35:53.216 --> 00:35:55.653
Uh, 50,000 acres.

531
00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.822
50,000 acres?

532
00:35:57.955 --> 00:35:59.389
Exactly how big is that?

533
00:36:00.223 --> 00:36:02.827
It's twenty miles long,
four miles wide.


534
00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.963
Wow. Okay.

535
00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:08.766
How many people
live on your ranch?


536
00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:09.834
We got seven.

537
00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:12.603
Seven?
Seven people?


538
00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:16.206
Dude, that's almost like
the size of Detroit,


539
00:36:16.339 --> 00:36:18.274
and we got 700,000
people there.


540
00:36:18.408 --> 00:36:20.310
Y'all got seven
people on the ranch?


541
00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:22.212
Dude, I know you get lonely.

542
00:36:23.246 --> 00:36:24.849
No, man, it's...

543
00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.518
it's paradise.

544
00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:28.919
Just come out
and see it some time


545
00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:30.721
and you'll know
what I'm talking about.


546
00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:32.723
I just might have to take you
up on that offer, man.


547
00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:35.225
But first, is there
any Black people out there?


548
00:36:35.358 --> 00:36:37.528
- We ain't got no Black people.
- What?


549
00:36:39.329 --> 00:36:40.765
Man, you're telling me
you want me to come


550
00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:44.367
to a place where
there's no Black folk,


551
00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:48.304
a few white folk and a whole
lot of empty space?


552
00:36:49.172 --> 00:36:50.240
Yeah, a'ight.

553
00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.410
Why are there no Black people
out there, man?


554
00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.146
You know, honestly,
I have no idea.


555
00:36:55.278 --> 00:36:57.882
It's kind of funny
'cause Black cowboys


556
00:36:58.015 --> 00:37:00.651
were some of the first people
to settle the West.


557
00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:05.723
Well, look, man,
I'm definitely interested.


558
00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:08.826
And I just may have to
take you up on that offer.


559
00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:10.193
Maybe.

560
00:37:10.326 --> 00:37:11.762
Gonna have to count us in.

561
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:14.498
What, they let the riffraff
in here this morning?


562
00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:17.233
In? You guys are supposed
to be in 20 minutes ago, man.


563
00:37:17.367 --> 00:37:19.235
Hey, government time.
Government time.


564
00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:21.337
Tu, what you say, next game?

565
00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:23.373
So, since we're all here,

566
00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.543
what made you join
the military, Casey?


567
00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:27.343
Oh, uh...

568
00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.781
I don't know.
Family tradition, I guess.


569
00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:33.884
Four generations have served.

570
00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:37.353
My dad died
in the Beirut bombings.


571
00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.858
Felt like something
I needed to do.


572
00:37:40.991 --> 00:37:42.425
What about you?

573
00:37:43.426 --> 00:37:45.563
Mine is, um,
it's pretty simple.


574
00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:47.131
Actually, very simple.

575
00:37:47.263 --> 00:37:49.232
But to make a
long story short...


576
00:37:50.634 --> 00:37:54.171
my daddy left my mom,
me and my little brother


577
00:37:54.304 --> 00:37:55.706
like 12 years ago.

578
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.509
And my mom, she was working
two jobs back then.


579
00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:00.778
And it was horrible
to see my mom, you know,


580
00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:03.814
hustling like that,
trying to make ends meet.


581
00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:07.618
My little brother was doing
horrible in school.


582
00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:09.653
It was just all around
bad, bro.


583
00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.589
But thank God
for the military.


584
00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.290
You know, it really
changed our lives.


585
00:38:14.424 --> 00:38:16.894
Now, my mom, she only works

586
00:38:17.027 --> 00:38:19.163
You know, they don't
hear gunshots anymore.


587
00:38:19.295 --> 00:38:20.631
Unfortunately, I do.

588
00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:22.500
But, you know, it's a blessing
to have my family


589
00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:24.168
out of that situation.

590
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.670
My little brother's following
right behind my footsteps.


591
00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:28.304
And I just got married, guys.

592
00:38:28.438 --> 00:38:31.341
So, my life is good.
I'm blessed.


593
00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:33.844
Tu, what about you?

594
00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.913
Well, um...

595
00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:39.550
My parents made it
out of Vietnam on a boat


596
00:38:39.683 --> 00:38:41.752
and they were out
on the South China Sea


597
00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.888
when they were rescued
by the US Navy.


598
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:46.524
They became
commercial fishermen.


599
00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.959
And they're the hardest
working people I know.


600
00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:52.328
Luckily, I had the good
fortune of going to Harvard.


601
00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:53.697
Some folks might say

602
00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.866
you're wasting a high
powered education.


603
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.003
Yeah. But the military is
part of my master plan.


604
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.572
- Master plan, huh?
- Now, listen,


605
00:39:01.705 --> 00:39:03.874
seven out of 43 presidents
have Harvard degrees.


606
00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:07.111
31 out of 43
served in the military.


607
00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:08.846
There's a method
to my madness.


608
00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:10.114
Okay.

609
00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:12.616
My money's on the fisherman
from the bayou.


610
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.819
Well, John, how about you?

611
00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.887
I'm from
Highland Park, Texas.


612
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:19.089
My dad's in the oil business
up there.


613
00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.324
You know,
to tell you the truth,


614
00:39:21.458 --> 00:39:23.894
he really wasn't excited
about me signing up.


615
00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:26.597
But my grandfather
was a World War II hero,


616
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.099
and I admired him
my whole life.


617
00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:31.869
You can call it whatever
you want-- rich white guilt.


618
00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:34.271
But I just wasn't gonna sit
in the lap of luxury


619
00:39:34.404 --> 00:39:35.840
- my whole life.
- What?


620
00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:38.642
That sounds like
a comfortable lap to sit in.


621
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.046
So, Joe.
What's your story, bro?


622
00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.615
I'm Lakota Sioux.

623
00:39:44.748 --> 00:39:47.718
Lakotas were great warriors
for generations.


624
00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.320
And at one time we were
one of the greatest


625
00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:51.088
light cavalry in the world.

626
00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:54.725
Native Americans have
the highest per capita


627
00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:58.529
military service of any
ethnic group in America.


628
00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:01.999
There have been

629
00:40:02.132 --> 00:40:03.399
from the Native Americans.

630
00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:08.706
These warrior ways,
they run deep and die hard.


631
00:40:10.274 --> 00:40:11.407
My man...

632
00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:15.145
that's like you're working
for the same institution...


633
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.781
that oppressed your people.

634
00:40:18.782 --> 00:40:20.818
Yeah, some would say
the same institution


635
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:22.920
that tried to enforce slavery.

636
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.990
But history is a river, guys.

637
00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:29.660
You can't dam it up.
You can't back it up.


638
00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:32.897
We can't change the past.

639
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:37.167
You can only alter its
downstream course, the future.


640
00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:39.904
Because an eye for an eye

641
00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:42.106
would leave this
whole world blind.


642
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.543
No cross, no crown.

643
00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:50.681
No pains, no gains.

644
00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:54.885
You know, Joe...

645
00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:57.888
Always wanted a brother.

646
00:40:58.022 --> 00:41:01.692
Now I got four
from all walks of life.


647
00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:04.595
Leave it to
the US military, huh?


648
00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:07.598
<i>De oppresso liber.</i>

649
00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:09.033
[All] To free the oppressed.

650
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.001
Whoa!

651
00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.303
What's up, man?

652
00:41:12.435 --> 00:41:14.104
How we doing?
Okay, boys.


653
00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:15.272
We officially made it.

654
00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:16.874
Graduation present.

655
00:41:17.007 --> 00:41:18.542
We're going off to cowboy
paradise, but here's the deal.


656
00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:20.110
I can only
adopt one of y'all,


657
00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:22.246
so there might be a fight
to death to earn that spot.


658
00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:23.647
My bets are on John.

659
00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:26.917
So Casey,

660
00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:30.087
you're telling me in the age
of the Internet,


661
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.122
fast cars and airplanes,

662
00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.725
you are still
talking about horses?


663
00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:38.662
John, there's been five major
advances in man's ability


664
00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:40.264
to transcend
space and time, okay,


665
00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:41.865
and that has been the
domestication of the horse,


666
00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:43.500
the sailing vessel,
the steam locomotive,


667
00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.035
the car and the airplane,
okay?


668
00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:46.837
They all have a romantic
culture surrounding them,


669
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:49.406
but only one has
a dynamic relationship.


670
00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.708
Oh, man.

671
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.843
You know, relationships,
I don't know.


672
00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:54.778
You're talking about
an ignorant beast of burden.


673
00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:57.815
What exactly do you mean,
relationship?


674
00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.217
Okay, you can ask
millions of people,


675
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.852
millions of testimonies.

676
00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:03.954
But there's a magical bond
between a man and his horse.


677
00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:05.322
Going to have to sell me, man.

678
00:42:05.457 --> 00:42:07.024
It sounds a little crazy.

679
00:42:07.157 --> 00:42:08.225
Hey, laugh all you want.

680
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.927
Just telling you what it is.

681
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:13.630
White dude speak
with unified tongue.


682
00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:16.166
Woo!

683
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.068
[shouting]

684
00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:23.607
- Cowboy land, baby.
- Woohoo!


685
00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:25.843
Hey.
Oh, wow.


686
00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:27.378
All right, guys.
This is mom.


687
00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:29.513
This is grandma and grandpa.
These are the guys.


688
00:42:29.646 --> 00:42:30.881
Nice to meet you.

689
00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:31.715
Oh, wow.

690
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:33.751
- Cowboy.
- Oh, wow.


691
00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.062
Don't believe anything
she says, y'all.


692
00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:46.930
Hey, boys. Jackpot.
Bull riding tomorrow.


693
00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:48.899
You ain't gotta ride
unless you're feeling froggy.


694
00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:51.869
But you're welcome to join.
Come watch, cool?


695
00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:54.104
All right, turn in early.
You got a long day tomorrow.


696
00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:04.181
Mr. Shane, this must be
Casey's dad.


697
00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:07.951
Yep. That's him.

698
00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:12.356
He was a... he was a great,
great man, served in Vietnam


699
00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:16.627
and survived Vietnam
and died in an age of peace.


700
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.498
Beirut '83.
Casey told us about it.


701
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:21.765
Yeah.

702
00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:23.400
Very sorry for your loss,
Mr. Shane.


703
00:43:23.535 --> 00:43:25.569
Well, I appreciate that.

704
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.606
Pain fades,
but never goes away completely.


705
00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:34.878
But Casey was a real blessing.
He was a clone of his dad.


706
00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:37.014
Every time I look at him, I...

707
00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:48.058
thought I was looking
at his dad.


708
00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:56.867
But... he gave me
a second shot at fatherhood,


709
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.237
and it's been a great ride.

710
00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:06.610
This country
never ceases to amaze me.


711
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:08.946
Right.

712
00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:11.583
Greatness emerges
from every corner.


713
00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.050
Amen.

714
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:22.326
Good Lord, what a surprise.

715
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.894
Look at you, man.

716
00:44:24.027 --> 00:44:25.530
- Still one piece, one piece.
- All grown up, man.


717
00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:27.331
- How's everything, man?
- Still alive.


718
00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:28.699
- Still breathing, kicking.
- All right.


719
00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.100
- Everything's good?
- Yeah.


720
00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:32.336
All right, come on in, man.
Come on in.


721
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.106
Hey, Carla, you ain't gonna
believe who's here.


722
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.307
Carla.

723
00:44:39.076 --> 00:44:41.111
- Thank you.
- Thanks, hon.


724
00:44:42.045 --> 00:44:44.181
Sure is good to see you guys.
Yeah.


725
00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:47.384
How's everybody doing?
Family, parents?


726
00:44:48.453 --> 00:44:50.821
I heard Maria is still
riding in school?


727
00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.161
How is she?

728
00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.233
Fair.

729
00:45:07.639 --> 00:45:09.673
Casey, whatever happened...

730
00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:12.376
you broke her heart.

731
00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:16.880
I messed up.

732
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.217
And I know that.

733
00:45:21.519 --> 00:45:23.921
I'd do anything
to take it back, but I can't.


734
00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:29.860
I just hope that you two
are able to forgive me someday.


735
00:45:31.529 --> 00:45:33.931
Please, I just need
to talk to her.


736
00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:38.168
Well, Casey...

737
00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.839
she made me swear
I would not do that.


738
00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:50.013
Please, Juan.

739
00:45:56.386 --> 00:45:59.756
Sorry. We can't.

740
00:46:04.462 --> 00:46:05.796
Yes, sir.

741
00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.869
Well, I got
our guests waiting.


742
00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:16.039
It's been a long day,
I should probably head off.


743
00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:17.975
Just wanted to stop by,
say hello,


744
00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:20.110
see how everyone's doing.

745
00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.213
Yeah.

746
00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:26.316
Thinking about you over there.

747
00:46:27.485 --> 00:46:28.819
Praying for you.

748
00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:34.057
Come by again to have
some of those tortillas.


749
00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:36.293
Yeah.

750
00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:53.210
Could you give her
this for me?


751
00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:56.213
Just tell her I love her,
please.


752
00:46:58.616 --> 00:46:59.617
I will.

753
00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:04.254
But I think she's ready
to move on without you, Casey.


754
00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:08.325
She sent all your letters
back to me unread.


755
00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.498
Casey...

756
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.601
Take care of yourself.

757
00:47:16.734 --> 00:47:18.469
I will. Promise.

758
00:47:24.742 --> 00:47:26.477
[engine starts]

759

[snoring]

760
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.590
Oh-ho-ho.

761
00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.528
All right, let's go, boys, come
on, wake up, wake up, wake up!


762
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:45.862
Everybody, let's go, let's go,
come on, come on.


763
00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:47.364
Burning daylight,
here we go.


764
00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:49.132
Yeah, let's go.
Good morning, how you doing?


765
00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:50.434
Man, I'm from the hood,

766
00:47:50.568 --> 00:47:51.803
you can't be barging in
like that.


767
00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:53.003
Five minutes, Tu,
if you don't get


768
00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.772
that scrawny butt
of yours up, boy.


769
00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:55.906
Let's go.

770
00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:57.575
I'll meet y'all out there.

771
00:48:02.747 --> 00:48:04.549
Hustle up, boys.

772
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.017
Ready, boys?

773
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.454
All right, Poppy is gonna
show you how it's done.


774
00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:11.088
You might want to listen up,
'cause I've seen you all

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:13.156
try and aim
a rifle before, so...


776
00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:15.793
Good morning.

777
00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:17.795
Welcome to New Mexico.

778
00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:21.466
Hold your hands up.
How many fingers you got?


779
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:23.300
- Ten.
- Ten?


780
00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.102
The objective is
to come away with ten


781
00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:27.003
after you finish roping.

782
00:48:28.706 --> 00:48:30.207
Roll that wrist.

All right,
nothing to it.

All you gotta do
is think it there.

So, who wants to try it first?

Oh!

Hey!

Woo-hoo-hoo.

Maria.
We got to have a girl talk.


796
00:49:41.211 --> 00:49:43.113
That sounds kind of serious.

797
00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:46.818
Maria, I've bit my tongue
for months now,


798
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.152
and that's not fair
or right to you.

the tea leaves for you.

motivated and ambitious...

standards or...


808
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:26.423
Maria is running
from something.

Yes.

816

I don't know
what's wrong with me.


817
00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:54.819
I feel like I can't
move forward


818
00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:58.689
and... I can't go back.

819

Back to what?

820
00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:07.798
You're still in love
with Casey, aren't you?

Maybe.

822

Yeah, like maybe the sun
will rise tomorrow.


823
00:51:18.743 --> 00:51:21.779
Did he ever reach out
to you after the breakup?


824
00:51:23.915 --> 00:51:27.183
Yeah, he sent
several letters to my parents.


825
00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:28.786
Did you respond?

826
00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:32.222
No.

827
00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:38.596
Well, that's a creative way
to catch a guy.


828
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.132
That's playing
hard to get on steroids.


829
00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:45.736
Well, I...

830
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.673
I didn't think I could ever
get over the betrayal.


831
00:51:50.675 --> 00:51:54.512
And then I got to the point
where I thought


832
00:51:54.645 --> 00:51:58.148
I'd take him back
if he crawled on broken glass.


833
00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:02.453
And then I got to
the point where I'd...


834
00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:05.322
take him back
if he just walked in.


835

But... by then he was over

836
00:52:23.406 --> 00:52:25.876
You got to send him
a smoke signal, girl.

- Like, how?
- Like...

Like, how about
the old-fashioned way?


839
00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:37.955
Write him a letter.
Express your true feelings.

Send it snail mail.

Spill some perfume on it.

I don't know
if I could do that.

Hmm.

figure it out, and fairly soon.

How was he?

I'd say he was good
and that he looked great.

take time.

So, Jesus' disciples
came to him


1262
01:28:22.933 --> 01:28:25.703
with a very
interesting question.


1263
01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:30.207
They said, "Lord, who sinned?

1264
01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:34.444
"This man or his parents,
that he should be born blind?"


1265
01:28:34.578 --> 01:28:37.648
Jesus said neither.

1266
01:28:37.782 --> 01:28:42.219
It's what theologians
call the mystery of evil.


1267
01:28:42.352 --> 01:28:45.756
How can good and evil coexist

1268
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:48.893
to bring about
the glory of God?

Hello, Casey.

Leaving in the middle
of the night


1292
01:32:05.122 --> 01:32:06.458
without telling me
where you're going

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:07.758
and not responding
to my letters


1294
01:32:07.891 --> 01:32:09.593
sure didn't
feel like forgiveness.


1295

You ignored my letter, too.

1296

Never got a letter from you.

1297

Well, I sent one
eight months ago,


1298

and I never heard anything
back from you.


1299
01:32:21.772 --> 01:32:23.874
You know, forgiveness
is one thing.


1300
01:32:24.675 --> 01:32:26.110
But growing up
with another person


1301
01:32:26.243 --> 01:32:28.846
in a committed love
relationship for a lifetime...


1302
01:32:29.813 --> 01:32:31.281
that's even bigger.

1303
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:35.519
Ideals are prickly things.

1304
01:32:36.987 --> 01:32:40.057
Without them, life
isn't worth much, and...


1305
01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:44.661
with them can come
disappointment.


1306
01:32:45.929 --> 01:32:48.132
I grew up believing
that cowboys were tried


1307
01:32:48.265 --> 01:32:51.201
and true to their word

1308
01:32:51.335 --> 01:32:52.770
and their people.

1309
01:32:54.738 --> 01:32:56.673
And especially their women.

1310
01:32:59.109 --> 01:33:02.579
I can fix it.
We can put it back together.


1311
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:09.853
What we had was so special.

1312
01:33:13.491 --> 01:33:14.825
So unique.

1313
01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.596
I thought it was a one
in a million kind of thing.


1314
01:33:22.766 --> 01:33:24.601
I thought it was sacred.

1315
01:33:24.735 --> 01:33:27.938
But... you trashed it.

1316
01:33:30.841 --> 01:33:34.278
And if you would trash it
in the best of times,


1317
01:33:34.411 --> 01:33:35.913
how could I ever trust you

1318
01:33:36.046 --> 01:33:38.048
to be there when
the days go dark?


1319

I... cannot.

1320
01:33:42.086 --> 01:33:45.689
And I will not live
with a man I cannot trust.


1321
01:33:49.359 --> 01:33:51.128
Some awfully hard words.

1322
01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:55.399
Sometimes life is hard.

1323
01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:59.303
Sometimes we make them hard
by our own actions.


1324
01:33:59.436 --> 01:34:01.872
Doesn't that tried and true
go both ways?


1325

I'm in a bad place, Maria,

1326

best friend could help me out.

my shattered dreams

02:06:47.037 --> 02:06:49.139
- You fix things?
- No.


1571
02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:51.275
All right.

1572
02:06:53.343 --> 02:06:55.646
- Got any boots?
- No.


1573
02:06:55.779 --> 02:06:58.782
No?
We'll figure it out.

All right, Bo.


1576
02:08:02.112 --> 02:08:04.081
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?


1577
02:08:04.214 --> 02:08:06.416
Cowboy, just like you, Pop.

1578
02:08:07.417 --> 02:08:09.686
We come from
a long line of cowboys.


1579
02:08:10.622 --> 02:08:12.756
We love big sky, open range.

1580
02:08:13.525 --> 02:08:15.325
We work hard.

1581
02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:16.960
Man of our word.

1582
02:08:18.996 --> 02:08:21.064
Loyal to our friends
and family.


1583
02:08:22.199 --> 02:08:24.001
Treat everyone with respect,

1584
02:08:24.801 --> 02:08:26.270
especially our women.

1585
02:08:28.473 --> 02:08:29.740
Courageous.

1586
02:08:30.674 --> 02:08:32.176
Fearing God
and no man.


1587
02:08:34.646 --> 02:08:36.980
Don't forget the important
things in life, Bo.


1588
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:40.083
Friendship with God.

1589
02:08:40.217 --> 02:08:41.785
Family, friends.

1590
02:08:41.919 --> 02:08:43.420
And a good horse.

1591
02:08:45.222 --> 02:08:49.693
If you do that,
you'll be a rich man...


1592
02:08:50.928 --> 02:08:52.362
and a good cowboy.

1593
02:08:58.168 --> 02:09:00.003
That's what I want
to be.
