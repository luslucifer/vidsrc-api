00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.145
<i>Sit on my face
And tell me that you love me</i>


2
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.621
<i>I'll sit on your face
And tell you I love you too</i>


3
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.307
<i>I love to hear you oralise
When I'm between your thighs</i>


4
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.700
<i>You blow me away</i>

5
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.101
<i>Sit on my face
And let my lips embrace you</i>


6
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.104
<i>I'll sit on your face
And then I'll love you truly</i>


7
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.784
<i>Life can be fine if we both 69</i>

8
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.590
<i>If we sit on our faces
In all sorts of places and play</i>


9
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.108
<i>Till we're blown away</i>

10
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.221
Hello, good evening and welcome
to the Ronald Reagan Memorial Bowl...


11
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.429
...here in the pretty little L.A. suburb
of Hollywood...


12
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.979
...where we're about
to witness all in wrestling...


13
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.542
...brought to you tonight, ladies and
gentlemen, by the makers of Scum...


14
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.702
...the world's first ever combined hair
oil, foot ointment and salad dressing.


15
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.746
And the makers of Titan,
the novelty nuclear missile.


16
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.708
You never know when it will go off.

17
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.941
Surprise your friends,
amuse your enemies...


18
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.260
...start the party with a bang.

19
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.580
Introducing, ladies and gentlemen,
tonight...


20
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.745
...all the way from a mud-wrestling tour
of the OPEC countries...


21
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.266
...in the red corner,
Colin "Bomber" Harris.


22
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.740
And ladies and gentlemen,
in the blue corner...


23
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.902
...all the way from a mud-wrestling tour
of the OPEC countries...


24
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.266
...Colin "Bomber" Harris.

25
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.703
Well, now, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the first time...


26
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.864
...that Colin "Bomber" Harris
has met himself.


27
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.823
A few formalities now.
Any moment now, we'll be ready...


28
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.664
...for the start of round one.
There goes the bell.


29
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.299
Colin moves
to the middle of the ring there.


30
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.586
He's looking for an opening.

31
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.787
Going for the handhold.

32
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.788
He's got it.

33
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.661
Into the head-squeeze.
A head-squeeze there.


34
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.266
A favourite move of Colin's
at this opening stage. Right now.


35
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.389
And already Colin is working on
that weak left knee of his.


36
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.424
The half Nelson.

37
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.547
Half Nelson
and a Phlladelphia Half Lotus.


38
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.462
And Colin bit himself
on purpose there.


39
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.190
And he has been given
a public warning by the referee.


40
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.466
And Colin did not
like that one little bit.

41
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.547
Double overhead nostril.

42
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.941
Back kick
and into the Boston Crayfish.


43
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.942
No, it's a Crawfish.
Or is it Langoustine?


44
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.307
It's the Langoustine. A lovely move.
He's caught himself by surprise...


45
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.223
...and that is the first fall
to Colin "Bomber" Harris.


46
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.986
Well, a lovely move there.
Colin must be pleased with himself...


47
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.222
...for having caught himself out
with that one. And a forearm chop.


48
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.109
A strawberry whip. 
A vanilla whip.

49
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.502
Chocolate whip.
There it is, Colin's most famous hold...


50
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.059
...the one-leg,
over-shoulder Gerry Ford.


51
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.460
And Colin's in real trouble.

52
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.505
He's just made it to the rope.
Just a little lucky there. There it is.


53
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.628
A double Eydle Gorme. Should be able
to twist out of this.


54
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.781
And he does
but he's looking pretty groggy.


55
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.749
He's caught himself with two forearm
smashes and that is it.


56
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.789
Colin "Bomber" Harris
has knocked himself out.


57
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.628
And so he is the winner...

58
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.340
...and he goes on next week
to meet himself In the final.


59
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.460
<i>Never be rude to an Arab</i>

60
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.148
<i>An Israeli or Saudi or Jew</i>

61
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.665
<i>Never be rude to an Irishman</i>

62
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.064

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.663
<i>Never poke fun at a nigger</i>

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.700

65

<i>And never poke--</i>

66
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.145
Michelangelo to see you,
Your Holiness.


67
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.304
- Who?
- Michelangelo...


68
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.859
...famous Renaissance artist
whose works include...


69
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.466
...the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel
and the celebrated statue of David.


70
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.907
- Very well.
- In 1514, he returned to Florence and--


71
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.142
All right, that's enough, that's enough.
They've got it now.


72
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.619
- Good evening, Your Holiness.
- Evening, Michelangelo.


73
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.545
I wanna have a world with you about
this painting of yours, <i>The Last Supper</i>.


74
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.350
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm not happy about it.


75
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.902
- Oh, dear. It took me hours.
- Not happy at all.


76
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.947
Is it the Jell
-O you don't like?

77
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.061
- No.
- They add a bit of colour, don't they?


78
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.824
Oh, I know.
You don't like the kangaroo.


79
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.345
- What kangaroo?
- No problem, I'll paint him out.


80
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.740
- I never saw a kangaroo.
- He's right at the back.


81
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.629
I'll paint him out, no sweat.
I'll make him into a Disciple.


82
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.180
- All right?
- That's the problem.


83
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.261
- What is?
- The Disciples.


84
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.384
Are they too Jewish?

85
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.260
I made Judas the most Jewlish.

86
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.740
No, it's just that
there are 28 of them.

87
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.349
Another will never matter.
I'll make the kangaroo into another.


88
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.945
- No, that's not the point.
- I'll lose the kangaroo.


89
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.989
- I wasn't perfectly happy with it.
- That's not the point.


90
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.141
There are 28 Disciples.

91
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.663
- Too many?
- Well, of course it's too many.


92
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.027
I know that, I wanted to give
the impression of a real Last Supper.


93
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.741
You know, not just any old last supper.
Not like a last meal or a final snack.


94
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.299
But, you know, I wanted to give
the impression...


95
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.189
...of a real mother of a blowout,
you know?


96
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.741
There were only 12 Disciples
at the Last Supper.


97
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.947
Maybe some of the other ones
came after--


98
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.623
There were only 12 altogether.

99
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.861
- Maybe some of their friends came by.
- Look.


100
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.500
There were just 12 Disciples
and our Lord at the Last Supper.


101
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.820
The Bible clearly says so.

102
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.788
- No friends?
- No friends.


103
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.262
- Waiters?
- No.


104
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.024
- Cabaret?
- No.


105
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.784
I like them. They help flesh out
the scene. I could lose--


106
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.988
Look, there were only 12 Disciples at--

107
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.619
I've got it. I've got it.

108
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.623
We'll call it <i>The Last But One Supper</i>.

109
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.269
- What?
- There must have been one.


110
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.502
If there was a last one, there
must have been a one before that.


111
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.230
So this is the <i>Penultimate Supper</i>.

112
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.904
The Bible doesn't say
how many people were there?


113
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.265
- No.
- There you are, then.


114
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.627
Look, the Last Supper Is a significant
event in the life of our Lord.


115
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.906
The penultimate supper was not.

116
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.630
Even if they had a conjurer
and a mariachi band.


117
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.863
A <i>Last Supper</i> I commissioned
from you, and a <i>Last Supper</i> I want.


118
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.544
With 12 disciples and one Christ.

119
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.390
- One?
- Yes, one.


120
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.866
Will you please tell me
what possessed you...


121
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.022
...to paint this
with three Christs in it?


122
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.420
- It works, mate.
- Works?


123
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.025
Yeah. It looks great.

124
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.227
The fat one balances
the two skinny ones.


125
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.223
There is only one Redeemer.

126
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.508
I know that. We all know that.
What about artistic license?


127
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.947
- Well, one Messiah is what I want.
- I'll tell you what you want, mate.


128
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.420
You want a bloody photographer,
that's what.


129
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.104
- Not a bloody creative artist to flesh--
- I'll tell you.


130
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.548
I want a <i>Last Supper</i> with one Christ,

131
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.862
...no trampoline acts
by Thursday lunch...


132
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.543
...or you don't get paid.

133
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.910
- Bloody fascist.
- Look, I'm the bloody Pope, I am.


134
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.903
May not know much about art,
but I know what I like.


135
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.384
<i>Never be rude to a Polack--</i>

136
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.661
<i>Hello, and welcome to Munich
for the 27th Silly Olympiad...</i>


137
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.822

<i>Here we are at the first event
of the afternoon.</i>


141
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.425
<i>The second semifinal of the 100 yards
for people with no sense of direction.</i>


142
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.661
<i>I'll just give you
the competitors' name once.</i>


143
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.390
<i>Skolomovski of Poland,
Zatapatique of France...</i>

146

<i>...and in the outside lane,
Bormann of Brazil.</i>


147
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.024
<i>Well, that was fun, wasn't it?</i>

148
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.466
<i>And now over to the other end
of the stadium.</i>


149
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.986
<i>Here, we're just waiting for the start
of the 1500 metres for the deaf.</i>


150
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.539
<i>And they're under starter's orders.</i>

151
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.907
<i>We'll be coming back the moment
there's action. Over to the swimming.</i>


152
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.539
<i>You join us here at
the Bundesabsurd Pool in time...</i>


153
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.702
<i>...10 see the start of the 200-metres
freestyle for non-swimmers.</i>


154
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.781
<i>Watch for the tough
Australian champion...</i>


155
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.783
<i>...Ron Barnett in the second lane.</i>

156
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.741
<i>We'll bring you back the moment
they start fishing the corpses out.</i>


157
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.505
<i>But now over to Hans Clegg for the
start of the marathon for incontinents.</i>


158
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.946
<i>Well, we've got an enormous entry
for this event.</i>


159
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.624
<i>Forty-four competitors
from 29 different countries.</i>


160
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.509
<i>All of them with
the most superbly weak bladders.</i>


161
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.786
<i>Not a tight sphincter in sight.</i>

162
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.669
<i>Ready to embark nevertheless
on the world's longest race...</i>


163
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.548
<i>...and they're just aching to go.</i>

164
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.462
<i>On your mark.</i>

165
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.462
<i>Get set.</i>

166
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.510
<i>And they're off, they're off.
Well, no, no, no.</i>


167
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.984
<i>We're back at the 1500 metres.</i>

168
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.982
<i>The starter is giving
a magnificent show.</i>


169
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.223
<i>We've had volleys, rapid bursts
scattered random fire, fusillades firing.</i>


170
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.779
<i>Well, and still he can't get
the buggers moving.</i>


171
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.829
<i>It's enough to make you
chew your own foot off.</i>


172
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.108
<i>And now the high jump. Katerina
Ovelenski for the Soviet Union.</i>


173
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.901
<i>But what a jump. What a jump!
That's got to be a record.</i>


174
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.428
<i>The 3000-metre steeplechase
for people who think they're chickens.</i>


175
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.501
<i>There's Samuelson
of the United States...</i>


176
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.627
<i>...and over there is Klaus
of East Germany.</i>


177
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.747
<i>A Rhode Island Red
the last three Olympics.</i>


178
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.901
<i>Here's the referee.
He's frightened them.</i>


179
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.061
<i>There's the leader,
Abe Seagull of Canada...</i>


180
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.460
<i>...who went off, got a good start
then settled...</i>


181
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.667
<i>...on the water jump,
and has now gone broody.</i>


182
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.980
<i>We're back with the marathon
for incontinents.</i>


183
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.109
<i>There's Polinski of Poland in the lead.
Brewer of Australia has taken over.</i>


184
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.944
<i>There's Laparche in front.
Brewer's got to spend a penny.</i>


185
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.579
<i>There's goes Brewer.
There goes König from Austria.</i>


186
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.630
<i>So now it's Alvarez of Cuba followed
by the plucky Norwegian, Bors.</i>


187
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.145
<i>They're in and out like yo-yos.
There's McNaughton.</i>


188
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.983
<i>The Scottish lad can't hold it.</i>

189
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.381
<i>Machlevic. Machlevic of Yugoslavia
has taken over. He can't hold it.</i>


190
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.780
<i>Well, well, these must be
the weakest bladders...</i>


191
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.543
<i>...ever to represent their country.</i>

192
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.465
<i>And now let's have a look back
at what's going on down on stage.</i>


193
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.700
Good evening, ladies and Bruces.

194
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.463
- Hello, Bruce.
- Good day, Bruce.


195
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.906
- How are you, Bruce?
- What's all this lot, Bruce?


196
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.188
It's very nice to be here
at the Hollywood Bowl this evening.


197
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.185
We're all philosophy professors from
the University of Woolamaloa, Australia.


198
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.750
Australia, Australia, Australia.

199
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.230
- We love you.
- God bless her.


200
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:13.100
I teach Hegelian philosophy, Bruce
here teaches Aristotelian philosophy...


201
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.069
...and Bruce here is in charge
of the sheep dip.


202
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.500
- Difficult work.
- It's thirsty work watching this humour.


203
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.140
Bruce, why don't you stick out a few
little free samples from your Esky--?


204
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.948
Give these Americans our precious--?

205
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.819
See how awful they are?
Grasping and trying to get things?


206
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.300
You can feel morally superior
and smug.


207
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.030
There's one coming right over there.
Mind out.


208
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.340
A big one.

209
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.662
All right. Now, the reason we do this,
ladles and Bruces...


210
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.505
...is frankly, over here we find
your American beer...


211
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.184
...is a little like making love
in a canoe.


212
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.743
- Making love in a canoe?
- It's fucking close to water.


213
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.344
Piss.

214
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.100
We're gonna try and raise the tone
a little here...


215
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.181
...by singing a nice,
intellectual song...


216
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.660
...for those two or three
of you in the audience...


217
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.264
...who understand these things.

218
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.784
So here we go.

219
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:12.229
<i>Immanuel Kant was a real pissant
Who was very rarely stable</i>


220
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.347
<i>Heidegger,
Heidegger was a boozy beggar</i>


221
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.740
<i>Who could think you under the table</i>

222
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.790
<i>David Hume could out-consume
Schopenhauer and Hegel</i>


223
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:25.262
<i>And Wittgenstein was a beery swine
Who was just as sloshed as Schlegel</i>


224
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.548
<i>There's nothing Nietzsche
Couldn't teach you</i>


225
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.907
<i>About the raising of the wrist</i>

226
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:37.065
<i>Socrates himself
Was permanently pissed</i>


227
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.144
- How'd you like that? All right?
- Let's hold it a second.


228
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:45.349
I can see some of these Bruces
are in a bit of a playful mood tonight.


229
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.909
Some of the ones
that don't have straws up thelr nose.


230
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.300
Anyway, why don't we do
something rather fun?


231
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.225
Why don't we get some of these guys
to sing? And some sheilas too.


232
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.744
That's wise, I tell you.

233
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.470
- Show them the words.
- Okay. I got the words somewhere.


234
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.904
- Right.
- Ready?


235
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:06.588
<i>Immanuel Kant was a real pissant
Who was very rarely stable</i>


236
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.787
<i>Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy--</i>

237
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.590
- They're a typical Hollywood audience.
- You're right.


238
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.549
The kids are on drugs.
All the adults are on roller skates.


239
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:15.984
Right on.

240
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.982
Very philosophical, Bruce.

241
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.426
Have we got anything bigger
to put the words up...


242
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.979
...for these
rather short-sighted people?


243
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.946
This is Bruce
from the Biology Department.


244
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.387
- All right. Okay.
- Here are the words. Here we go.


245
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.459
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'm afraid my walk...


246
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:58.750
...has become rather sillier recently.
It takes me longer to get to the office.


247
00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.265
Now, what was it again?

248
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.104
Well, sir, I have got a silly walk.

249
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.262
And I'd like to obtain government
backing to help me develop it.


250
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.627
I see. Well, may I see
this silly walk of yours?


251
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.064
Yes, certainly.

252
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.225
Yes, I see. That's it, is it?

253
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.427
- Well, yes, that's it.
- Yes, yes, yes.


254
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.187
It's not particularly silly, is it?
I mean, the left leg isn't silly at all.


255
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.503
The right leg merely does a forward,
O'Brien half-turn every alternate step.


256
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.140
Yes, but I feel with a federal grant,
I could make it a lot more silly.


257
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.348
Mr. Stagback, the very real problem
is one of finance.


258
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.660
You see, there's Defence, Education,
Housing...


259
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.707
...Health, Social Security, Silly Walks.

260
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.783
All to get the same.
Last year, the government spent less...


261
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.829
...on Silly Walks than they did
on Industrial Reorganisation.


262
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.585
We were supposed to get 348 million
pounds a year...


263
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.902
...to cover our entire
Silly Walks Programme.


264
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.459
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.


265
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.104
Hello, Mrs. Two-Lumps, could we have
two cups of coffee, please?


266
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.910
<i>- Yes, Mr. Teabag.</i>
- Mad as a hatter.


267
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.745
You see, the Israelis already have
a man who can take his left leg off...


268
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.062
...and swallow it with every alternate
step, whereas the Japanese...


269
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.143
...cunning,
electronically-obsessed little--


270
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.946
Yes. Thank you, Mrs. Two
-Lumps.

271
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.579
You're very interested in silly walks,
aren't you?


272
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.869
- Rather.
- Right. Well, take a look at this.


273
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.380
Oh, I've had a bitch of a morning
in the high court.


274
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.384
Oh, I could stamp my little feet,
the way those counsellors carry on.


275
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.382
- Oh, don't I know it, love?
- Oh, dear.


276
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.542
Objection here, objection there.

277
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.941
That nice policeman
giving his evidence so well.


278
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.181
- Beautiful speaking voice.
- And what a body.


279
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.580
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, very.


280
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.948
Well, after a bit, all I could do
is bang me gavel.


281
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.260
- You what, love?
- I banged me gavel.


282
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.909
- Oh, get away.
- I did.


283
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.626
I did my "silence in court" bit.
If looks could've killed...


284
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.828
...that prosecuting counsel
would have been in for 30 years.


285
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.063
- How did your summing up go?
- Oh, actually...


286
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.428
...I did it in my butch voice,
you know?


287
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.389
"What the jury must understand--"
And they loved it.


288
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.100
I could see that little curly-headed
foreman of the jury eyeing me.


289
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.386
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, cheeky devil.


290
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.349
I finished up with--
I got really strict.


291
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.628
"The actions of these vicious men
are a violent stain...


292
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.349
...upon the community.

293
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.423
And the full penalty of the law is
scarcely sufficient...


294
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.581
...to deal with their ghastly crimes."

295
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.787
And I waggled me wig.

296
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.668
- Waggled your what?
- I waggled me wig.


297
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.582
- Really?
- The only thing I waggled.


298
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.821
Ever so slightly. 
Stunning effect.

299
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.506
Anyway, I gave him three years.
He only took 10 minutes.


300
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.230
Well, as I said to Melvin Belly
the other day, you know:


301
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.620
"You can put it in the hand
of your attorneys...


302
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.542
...but It'll never stand up In court."

303
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.269
I know what you mean.

304
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.624
Good evening.

305
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.862
Tonight on <i>World Forum</i>
we are deeply privileged...


306
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.307
...to have with us Karl Marx,
the founder of modern socialism...


307
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.787
...and author
of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>.


308
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.586
Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov,
better known to the world as Lenin...


309
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.344
...leader of the Russian Revolution,
writer, statesman...


310
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.180
...and father of modern socialism.
Che Guevara...


311
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.943
...the Bolivian guerrilla leader...

312
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.709
...and Mao Tee-Tung, chairman
of the Chinese Communist Party...


313
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:01.424
...since 1949,

314
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.105
And the first question is for you,
Karl Marx.


315
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.784
The Hammers.

316
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.147
The Hammers is the nickname
of what English football team?


317
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.543
The Hammers.

318
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.339
No? Well, bad luck, Karl.
It is in fact Westham United.


319
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:28.026
Now, Che Guevara. Che.

320
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.499
Coventry City last won
the English Football Cup in what year?


321
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.227
I can throw the question open.
Anybody?


322
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:44.146
Coventry City last won
the English Football Cup in what year?


323
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.781
No? I'm not surprised you didn't
get that. It is in fact a trick question.


324
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.419
Coventry City have never won
the English Football Cup.


325
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.464
So now with the scores all even,
It's on to round two...


326
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.941
...and Lenin, your starter for $10.

327
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.106
Jerry Lee Lewis has had over 17 major,
solid-gold hits In the U.S. of A.


328
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.420
What's the name of the biggest?

329
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.428
Jerry Lee Lewis solid-gold biggie.

330
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.669
No? Yes, Mao Tse
-Tung?

331
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:22.266
-"Great Balls of Fire"?
- Yes, it was Indeed.


332
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.339
Very well challenged.
We come on to our third round.


333
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.423
Our contestant tonight is Karl Marx...

334
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.709
...and our special prize
is this beautiful lounge suite.


335
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.103
Karl has elected to answer questions
on workers' control of factories...


336
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.227
...so here we go with question
number one.


337
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:49.668
Nervous, Karl? Just a little.
Well, never mind, Karl. Have a go.


338
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.583
The development
of the industrial proletariat...


339
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.390
...is conditioned
by what other development?


340
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.264
The development
of the industrial bourgeoisie.


341
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.825
Good, yes, it is indeed.
Well done, Karl.


342
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.630
You're on your way
to your lounge suite.


343
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.747
Now, Karl, number two.

344
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:10.899
The struggle of class against class
is a what struggle?


345
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.303
- A political struggle.
- Good. Yes, it is indeed.


346
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.542
Well done, Karl.
One final question...


347
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.988
...and that beautiful, non-materialistic
lounge suite will be yours.


348
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.109
Ready, Karl? You're a brave man.
Your final question.


349
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.940
Who won the English Football Cup
in 1949?


350
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.147
The workers control the means
of production.


351
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.540
The struggle of the urban proletariat.

352
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.981
No, it was Wolverhampton Wanderers,
who beat Leicester 3-1.


353
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:39.902
Oh, shit.

354
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.227
Get out of here.

355
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.029
Well, no one leaves this show
empty-handed.


356
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.870
So we're gonna cut off his hands.

357
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.470
Well, now it's talent-spotting time,
ladles and gentlemen.


358
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:57.510
And please, see if you can spot
any talent in our next competitors.


359
00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.310
Will you please give a very big hand
and a warm welcome...


360
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.748
...to Carl Weetabix and Rita.

361
00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.986
<i>I'm the urban spaceman, baby
I've got speed</i>


362
00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.461
<i>I've got everything I need</i>

363
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.588
<i>I'm the urban spaceman, baby
I couldn't fly</i>


364
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.425
<i>I'm a supersonic guy</i>

365
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.424
<i>I don't need pleasure
I don't feel pain</i>


366
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.861
<i>If you were to knock me down,
I'd just get up again</i>


367
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.500
<i>I'm the urban spaceman, baby
I'm making out</i>


368
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.583
<i>I'm all about</i>

369
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.340
<i>I wake up every morning
With a smile upon my face</i>


370
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:46.140
<i>My natural exuberance
Spills out all over the place</i>


371
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.826
<i>I'm the urban spaceman
I'm intelligent and clean</i>


372
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.261
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

373
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:58.266
<i>I'm the urban spaceman
As a lover second to none</i>


374
00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.148
<i>It's a lot of fun</i>

375
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:04.019
<i>I never let my friends down,
I've never made a boob</i>


376
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.581
<i>I'm a glossy magazine,
An advert on the tube</i>


377
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.141
<i>I'm the urban spaceman, baby
Here comes the twist</i>


378
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.621
<i>I don't exist</i>

379
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.547
- Mr. Hilton?
Yes.


380
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.419
You are sole proprietor and owner
of the Whizzo Chocolate Company?


381
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.388
I am.

382
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.509
Constable Parrot and I
are from the Hygiene Squad.


383
00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.547
We'd like to have a word with you...

384
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.021
...about your box of chocolates
entitled the Whizzo Quality Assortment.


385
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.699
- Good, yes.
- If I may begin at the beginning.


386
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.384
First, there is the Cherry Fondue.

387
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.463
Now, this is extremely nasty.

388
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.383
- But we can't prosecute you for that.
- Agreed.


389
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.821
Next, we have number four.
Crunchy Frog.


390
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.310
Yes.

391
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.389
Am I right in thinking
there's a real frog in here?


392
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.263
Yes, a little one.

393
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.381
- Is it cooked?
- No.


394
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.069
What, a raw frog?

395
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:30.946
We use only the finest baby frogs,
dew-picked and flown from Iraq.


396
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.147
Cleansed in the finest quality
spring water.


397
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.586
Lightly killed and sealed
in a succulent Swiss...


398
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.742
...quintuple-smooth, full-cream,
treble milk chocolate envelope.


399
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.379
And lovingly frosted with glucose.

400
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.423
That's as may be,
but it's still a frog.

401
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.620
What else would it be?

402
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.861
Well, don't you even
take the bones out?


403
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.024
If we took the bones out,
it wouldn't be crunchy, would It?


404
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.944
Constable Parrot ate one of those.

405
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.340
- Would you excuse me a moment, sir?
- Yes.


406
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.743
Well, it says Crunchy Frog
quite clearly.


407
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.026
Never mind that.
We have to protect the public.


408
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.023
People aren't going to think
there's a real frog in chocolate.


409
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.466
The superintendent thought
it was an almond whirl.


410
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.019
They're bound to think
it's some kind of mock frog.


411
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.504
Mock frog?

412
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.220
We use no artificial preservatives
or additives of any kind.


413
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.866
Nevertheless, I advise you in future
to replace the words "Crunchy Frog"...


414
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:26.388
...with the legend "Crunchy, raw,
un-boned, real, dead frog"...


415
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.302
...if you want to avoid prosecution.

416
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:29.784
What about our sales?

417
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.300
I don't give a damn.
We have to protect the public.


418
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.747
Now, what was this one? Number five.
It was number five, wasn't It?


419
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.744
Number five, Ram's Bladder Cup.

420
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.100
Now, what kind of confection is this?

421
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:50.269
We use choicest juicy chunks
of fresh Cornish ram's bladder.


422
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.627
Emptied, steamed,
flavoured with sesame seeds.


423
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:56.703
Whipped into a fondue
and garnished with larks' vomit.


424
00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.504
- Larks' vomit?
- Correct.


425
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:03.300
It doesn't say anything down here
about larks' vomit.


426
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:07.947
Yes, It does. On the bottom of the box,
after monosodium glutamate.


427
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:11.422
I hardly think this is good enough.
It would be more appropriate...


428
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:15.868
...if the box bore a big red label
warning larks' vomit.


429
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.623
Our sales would plummet.

430
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.061
Well, why don't you move into more
conventional areas of confectionary?


431
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.825
Like praline or lime cream--
A very popular flavour, I understand.


432
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.219
--or Strawberry Delight?

433
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.224
I mean, what's this one?
Cockroach Cluster.


434
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:34.066
And this? Anthrax Ripple.

435
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.029
And what's this one?
Spring Surprise?


436
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.985
That's our speciallty. Covered
in darkest, velvety smooth chocolate.


437
00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.788
When you pop it in your mouth...

438
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:05.387
...stainless steel bolts spring out and
plunge straight through both cheeks.


439
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.105
If people pop a nice chockle
in their mouth...


440
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.103
...they don't expect
to get their cheeks pierced.


441
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.865
In any case, it is an inadequate
description of the sweetmeat.


442
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.584
I shall have to ask you
to accompany me to the station.


443
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.424
- It's a fair cop.
- And don't talk to the audience.


444
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.506
Albatross.

445
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.506
Albatross.

446
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.622
- I'd like some.
- Albatross!


447
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:04.028
You're not supposed to be
smoking that.


448
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.150
Albatross. Don't take them.

449
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.826
- What flavour is it? What flavour is it?
- Sea gull sickle.


450
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.867
Well, I'll have a one.

451
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.699
Pelican bonbon.

452
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:21.983
- Albatross.
- Could I have two ice creams, please?


453
00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.983
I haven't got any ice creams.
I've just got this albatross.


454
00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:28.859
- Albatross.
- What flavour is it?


455
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.424
Well, It's an albatross, isn't it?
It's not any bloody flavour.


456
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.059
- Albatross.
- There's got to be some flavour.


457
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.948
- Everything's got flavour.
- All right.


458
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.465
Bloody albatross flavour.

459
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:45.704
Bleeding sea bird bleeding flavour.
Albatross.


460
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:49.704
- You got wafers with it?
- I don't have fucking wafers, you cunt.


461
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:53.943
- It's a fucking albatross, Isn't It?
- Stop that, stop that.


462
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.828
It's filthy.

463
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.982
Come along. Right now, we need you.
The one in the black...


464
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:00.663
...we need you for another skit.

465
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.901
You get off.
You're not even a proper woman.


466
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.459
- Don't oppress me, mate.
- What are you trying to do?


467
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.940
- Avoid registration or something?
- Bleeding sexist.


468
00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.546
Just get off.
Come along, we need you for a skit.


469
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.266
No one enjoys a good laugh
more than I do.


470
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:17.343
Except perhaps my wife
and some of her friends.


471
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.821
And Capt. Johnson. Come to think of it,
most enjoy a good laugh...


472
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:23.220
...more than I do,
but that's besides the point.


473
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:25.222
Where's the other person for this skit?

474
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:28.140
Right.
Do you want to sit in that chair?


475
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:32.543
And to the skit.

476
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.303
Evening, squire.

477
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:36.268
Good evening.

478
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:42.468
Is your wife a goer?
Know what I mean? Know what I mean?


479
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.509
Nudge, nudge, know what I mean?
Say no more.


480
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:53.587
- I beg your pardon.
- Your wife. Does she go? Does she go?


481
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.946
Well, she sometimes has to go, yes.

482
00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.342
I bet she does, I bet she does.
Say no more, say no more.


483
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.387
Know what I mean?
Nudge, nudge.


484
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.268
- I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.
- Oh, follow me, follow me.


485
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.149
That's good. That's very good.
A nod's as good as a wink...


486
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.028
...to a blind bat.

487
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.068
- Are you selling something?
- Selling, selling. Very good indeed.


488
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.268
You're wicked, you are. Wicked.

489
00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.228
Wicked.

490
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.182
Say no more.

491
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.829
But I--

492
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.662
So your wife's interested in sport?

493
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.948
She likes sport, yes.

494
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.262
I bet she does, 
I bet she does.

495
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.660
As a matter of fact,
she's very fond of cricket.


496
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.390
She likes games? Likes games?

497
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.224
Knew she would. She's been
around a bit. She been around?


498
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:46.428
She has travelled, yes.
She's from Glendale.


499
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.982
Say no more.

500
00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:03.580
Glendale, squire. Say no more, say
no more, say no more, say no more.


501
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.229
Well, I--

502
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:07.664
Is your...?

503
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:12.301
Is your Glendale wife interested
in photography?


504
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.308
- Photography?
-"Photographs?"...


505
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.859
...he asked him, knowingly.

506
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.859
- Photography?
- Snap, snap, grin, grin, wink, wink...


507
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.589
...nudge, nudge, say no more.

508
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:24.502
- Sort of holiday snaps.
- They could be.


509
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.469
They could be taken on holiday.
Swimming costumes.


510
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.667
Candid, you know?
Candid photography.


511
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.867
No, we don't have a camera.

512
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.750
Still.

513
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.307
Look. Are you insinuating something?

514
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.790
Oh, no, no, no. Yes.

515
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.660
- Well?
- Well, I mean, you're--


516
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.741
You're a man of the world, aren't you?

517
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:58.028
- You've been around, you know?
- What do you mean?


518
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.308
Well, I mean, like, you've--
You know, you've, like...


519
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:06.670
...you've done it, you know?
You've slept with a lady.


520
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.709
Yes.

521
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.023
What's it like?

522
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.828
<i>Good afternoon and welcome to
a packed Olympic Stadium Munchen...</i>


523
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.501
<i>...for the second leg
of this exciting final.</i>


524
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.466
<i>And here come the Germans now,
lead by their skipper, "Nobby" Hegel.</i>


525
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.748
<i>They must start favourites.
They've attracted the most attention...</i>


526
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.867
<i>...from the press
with their team problems.</i>


527
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.419
<i>And let's now see their lineup.</i>

528
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.184
<i>The Germans playing four-two-four,
Leibniz in goal.</i>


529
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.705
<i>Back four: Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer
and Schelling.</i>


530
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.589
<i>Front-runners: Schiegel, Wittgenstein,
Nietzsche, Heidegger.</i>


531
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.185
<i>And the midfield duo of
Beckenbauer and Jaspers.</i>


532
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.024
<i>Beckenbauer obviously a bit
of a surprise there.</i>


533
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.946
<i>And here come the Greeks, led off
by their veteran centre half Heraclitus.</i>


534
00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.421
<i>Let's look at their team. As you'd
expect, it's a more defensive lineup.</i>


535
00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.501
<i>Plato's in goal.
Socrates, a front-runner.</i>


536
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:06.300
<i>And Aristotle as sweeper.
Aristotle, very much the man in form.</i>


537
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:08.666
<i>One surprise is the inclusion
of Archimedes.</i>


538
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.305
<i>Here comes the referee...</i>

539
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.984
<i>...K'ung-fu-tzu, Confucius
and his two linesmen:</i>


540
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.027
<i>Saint Augustan
and Saint Thomas Aquinas.</i>


541
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.467
<i>And as the two skippers come together
to shake hands...</i>


542
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.587
<i>...we're ready for the start
of this final.</i>


543
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.868
<i>The referee, Mr. Confucius,
checks his sound.</i>


544
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.102
<i>And they're off.
Nietzsche and Hegel there.</i>


545
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.310
<i>Jaspers, number seven on the outside.
Wittgenstein there with him.</i>


546
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.029
<i>There's Beckenbauer.</i>

547
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.545
<i>Schelling's in there,
Heidegger covering.</i>


548
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.383
<i>Schopenhauer.</i>

549
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.020
<i>And now it's the Greeks.
Epicurus, Plotinus number six.</i>


550
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.182
<i>Aristotle. Empedocies of Acragus,
and Democritus with him.</i>


551
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:53.586
<i>There's Archimedes.
Socrates. There he is, Socrates.</i>


552
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.588
<i>Socrates there, going through.</i>

553
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.502
<i>There's the ball, there's the ball.</i>

554
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.388
<i>We'll be bringing you back to this...</i>

555
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:05.789
<i>...exciting contest the moment
anything interesting happens.</i>


556
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.019
- Very passable, this. 
Very passable.

557
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.864
Nothing like a good glass of Chateau
de Chasselas, Josiah?


558
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.101
Oh, you're right there, Obidiah.

559
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.069
Who would have thought

560
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.063
...we'd all be sitting here drinking
Chateau de Chasselas?


561
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.980
We were glad
to have the price of a cup of tea.


562
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.823
A cup of cold tea.

563
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.789
- Without milk or sugar.
- Or tea.


564
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:39.504
- In a cracked cup was all.
- Oh, we never used to have a cup.


565
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.583
Woe used to have to drink
out of a rolled up newspaper.


566
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.505
The best we could manage
was to suck on a piece of damp cloth.


567
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.742
But, you know, we were happy
In those days although we were poor.


568
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:52.709
Because we were poor.
My old dad used to say to me:


569
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.589
-"Money doesn't bring you happiness."
- He was right.


570
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.264
I was happier then and I had nothing.

571
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.309
We used to live in this tiny, old,
tumbledown house...


572
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.620
...with great big holes in the roof.

573
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.747
House?
You were lucky to live in a house.


574
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:08.186
We used to live in one room,
all 26 of us.


575
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.307
No furniture,
half the floor was missing.


576
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:14.100
We were all huddled together
in one corner for fear of falling.


577
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:17.422
You were lucky to have a room.
We used to live in the corridor.


578
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.379
Oh, we used to dream of living
in a corridor.


579
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.187
Would have been a palace to us.

580
00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.706
We used to live in an old water tank
on a rubbish tip.


581
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:31.067
We got woke up every morning
by having a load of rotting fish...


582
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:34.222
...dumped all over us. House?

583
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.904
When I say house,
it was just a hole in the ground...


584
00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:41.143
...covered by a sheet of tarpaulin.
But it was a house to us.


585
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.587
We were evicted
from our hole in the ground.


586
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.980
We had to go
and live in a lake.

587
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.583
You were lucky to have a lake.

588
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.983
There were 150 of us living
in a shoebox In the middle of the road.


589
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:58.947
Cardboard box?
You were lucky.


590
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:03.908
Woe lived for three months in
a rolled up newspaper in a septic tank.


591
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.303
We used to have to get up at 6:00
and clean the newspaper...


592
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.462
...go to work down the mill,

593
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:12.826
...for six pence a week.
And when we got home...


594
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.823
...our dad would thrash us to sleep
with his belt.


595
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.062
Luxury.

596
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.300
We used to have to get out of the lake
at 3:00...


597
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.667
...clean the lake, eat hot gravel,
work 20 hours a day at the mill...


598
00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:28.709
...for twopence. Dad would
beat us around the head and neck...


599
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.100
...with a broken bottle if we were lucky.

600
00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.947
Well, of course we had it tough.

601
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:38.224
We used to have to get up
in the middle of the night...


602
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.620
...and lick the road clean
with our tongues.


603
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.144
We had to eat half a handful
of freezing cold gravel...


604
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.267
...work 24 hours a day
for four pence...


605
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.704
...and when we got home...

606
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.384
...our dad would slice us in two
with a bread knife.


607
00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.341
Right.

608
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:58.669
I had to get up at 10:00 at night
half an hour before I went to bed.


609
00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.788
Eat a lump of cold poison,
work 29 hours a day down mill...


610
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:04.100
...and pay mill owner
for permission to work...


611
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.580
...and when we got home,
our dad would kill us...


612
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.947
...and dance about on our graves,
singing "Hallelujah."


613
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.907
And you try and tell
the young people of today that...


614
00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.630
-...and they won't believe you.
- No, they won't.


615
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:25.308
<i>There may be no score,
but there's no lack of excitement here.</i>


616
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:29.020
<i>As you can see, Nietzsche has just been
booked for arguing with the referee.</i>


617
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.228
<i>He accused Confucius of having
no free will and Confucius, he say:</i>


618
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.664
<i>"Name go in box."</i>

619
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.504
<i>And this is Nietzsche's third booking
in four games.</i>


620
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:40.583
<i>And who's that? It's Karl Marx.
Karl Marx is warming up.</i>


621
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.106
<i>It looks as though there's going to be
a substitution on the German side.</i>


622
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.661
<i>Obviously, manager Martin Luther
has decided on all-out attackers.</i>


623
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.470
<i>Indeed he must with only two minutes
of the match to go.</i>


624
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.621
<i>The question is,
who is he going to replace?</i>


625
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.589
<i>Who's gonna come off?
Jaspers, Hegel or Schopenhauer.</i>


626
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.344
<i>But it's Wittgenstein who saw his aunty
only last week.</i>


627
00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.787
<i>Here's Marx. Let's see if he can
put some life into this German attack.</i>


628
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.146
<i>Evidently not. 
What a shame.</i>

629
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.904
<i>Now we've just over a minute left.
A replay on Tuesday...</i>


630
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.539
<i>...looks absolutely vital.
And there Archimedes.</i>


631
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:11.189
<i>And I think he's had an idea.</i>

632
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.910
<i>Eureka!</i>

633
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.902
<i>Archimedes out to Socrates.
Socrates back to Archimedes.</i>


634
00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.539
<i>Archimedes out to Heraclitus.
He beats Hegel.</i>


635
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.429
<i>Heraclitus, a little flick,
here he comes on the far post.</i>


636
00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.467
<i>Socrates is there. 
Socrates heads it in!</i>

637
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.463
<i>Socrates has scored.
The Greeks are going mad.</i>


638
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.668
<i>The Greeks are going mad.
What a beautiful cross from Archimedes.</i>


639
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.060
<i>The Germans are disputing it.
Hegel is arguing...</i>


640
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:37.586
<i>...that the reality is merely an a priori
adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics.</i>


641
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:41.539
<i>Kant is holding that, ontologically,
it exists only in the imagination.</i>


642
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.505
<i>And Marx is claiming it was offside.
But Confucius blows the final whistle.</i>


643
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:49.300
<i>It's all over. Germany having trounced
England's famous midfield trio:</i>


644
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:51.507
<i>Bentham, Locke and Hobbes
in the semifinal...</i>


645
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:55.061
<i>...have been beaten by the odd goal.
And let's see it again.</i>


646
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:58.626
<i>There it is. Socrates heads it in
and Leibniz doesn't have a chance.</i>


647
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:01.987
<i>And just look
at those delighted Greeks.</i>


648
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:05.666
<i>There they are, "Chopper" Socrates,
Empedocles of Acragus.</i>


649
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:07.741
<i>What a game he had.</i>

650
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.709
<i>And Epicurus is there.
And Socrates, the captain...</i>


651
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:14.579
<i>...who scored what was probably
the most important goal of his career.</i>


652
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.388
Good afternoon, sir. 
May I help you?

653
00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.144
Yes, I'd like to have an argument,
please.


654
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.544
Certainly, sir.
Have you been here before?


655
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.701
- No, this is my first time.
- I see.


656
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.180
Well, do you want to have
Just one argument...


657
00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.307
...or were you thinking
of taking a course?


658
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:46.461
- Well, what is the cost?
- Yes.


659
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.190
It's one pound
for a five-minute argument...


660
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.739
...but only eight pounds
for a course of 10.


661
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.947
I'll just try the one
and see how it goes.


662
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:59.628
- Fine. Yes, try Mr. Barnard, Room 12.
- Thank you very much.


663
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.310
- What do you want?
- Well, I--


664
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:05.460
Don't give me that.

665
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:07.621
- Snotty heap of parrot droppings.
- What?


666
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:11.260
Shut your festering gob, you tit.
Your type make me puke...


667
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.990
...you vacuous, toffee-nosed,
malodorous pervert.


668
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.346
Listen, I came here
for an argument. I--


669
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.069
Oh, I'm sorry, but this is Abuse.

670
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:22.428
- Oh, I see. Terribly sorry.
- No, you want Room 12A, next door.


671
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.060
- I see. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.


672
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:28.827
Stupid git.

673
00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.629
Is this the right room
for an argument?


674
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:36.782
- I've told you once.
- No, you haven't.


675
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:38.588
- Yes, I have.
- When?


676
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.423
- Just now.
- No, you didn't.


677
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.864
- Yes, I did.
- You didn't.


678
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.180
- I did.
- No. You must certainly did not.


679
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.705
Is this the five-minute
argument or the half-hour?


680
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.022
- I see. Just the five minutes.
- Just the five minutes. Right.


681
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.828
Thank you.

682
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.947
- Anyway, I did.
- Oh, no, you didn't.


683
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.909
Let's get one thing absolutely clear.
I definitely told you.


684
00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:00.142
- No, you didn't. No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.


685
00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:02.620
- No, you didn't. No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. I did.


686
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.066
- No. No. No, you didn't.
- Yes. Yes. Yes, I did.


687
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.301
Look, this Isn't an argument.

688
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:08.699
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.


689
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:10.269
- It's contradiction.
- It isn't.


690
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.546
- It is. You just contradicted me.
- I did not.


691
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.269
- You did just then.
- No, no, no.


692
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.580
- Nonsense.
- Oh, this is futile.


693
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.386
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.


694
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.382
- I came here for a good argument.
- No.


695
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:25.542
- You came here for an argument.
- An argument isn't contradiction.


696
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.189
Well, can be.

697
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.739
No, an argument is a series
of statements intended...


698
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.981
-...to establish a proposition.
- No, it isn't.


699
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:35.063
- Yes. It isn't just contradiction.
- Look, if I argue with you...


700
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:36.982
...I must take up a contrary position.

701
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.107
Yes, it isn't just saying,
"No, it isn't."


702
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.979
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't. No, it isn't. No, it isn't.


703
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:44.823
Argument is an intellectual process.

704
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:48.028
Contradiction is automatic gainsaying
of anything the person says.


705
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.988
- It is not. Not at all.
- It is.


706
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:52.346
- Now, look--
- Thank you, good morning.


707
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:57.388
- What?
- That's it. Good morning.


708
00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.100
- But I was just getting interested.
- I'm sorry. The five minutes is up.


709
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.739
- That was never five minutes.
- I'm afraid it was.


710
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.503
Oh, no, it wasn't.

711
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.181
I'm sorry, I'm not allowed
to argue anymore.


712
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.340
What?

713
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.343
If you want to go on,
you'll have to pay for another five.


714
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:16.183
That was never five minutes
Just now.


715
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.061
Oh, come on.

716
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.147
- Ridiculous.
- If you want me to go on...


717
00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:26.028
...pay for another five minutes.

718
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:28.942
Oh, all right.

719
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.867
- Here you are.
- Thank you.


720
00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:35.150
Well?

721
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.266
- Well, what?
- That was never five minutes.


722
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:42.183
If you want me to go on,
pay for another five minutes.


723
00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:44.261
Yes, yes, well, 
I've just paid.

724
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.659
No, you didn't.

725
00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.299
- I did. I did. I did.
- You did not. You did not.


726
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.586
- You never did. You never did.
- I did. I did.


727
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:54.061
- We're not going to argue about this.
- I'm very sorry, but you didn't.


728
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:57.945
Well, if I didn't pay,
why are you arguing?


729
00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.469
Gotcha.

730
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:06.104
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.


731
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.661
- If you're arguing, I must have paid.
- Not necessarily.


732
00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.503
I could be arguing in my spare time.

733
00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:13.989
- I've had enough.
- You haven't.


734
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:19.463
- Yes, I have. Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't. No, you haven't.


735
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:27.182
<i>I've got two legs from my hips
To the ground</i>


736
00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:31.264
<i>And when I lift them
They walk around</i>


737
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.741
<i>And when I lift them
They climb the stairs</i>


738
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:39.780
<i>And when I shave them
They ain't got hairs</i>


739
00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:02.742
<i>How sweet to be an idiot</i>

740
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:08.189
<i>As harmless as a cloud</i>

741
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:11.742
<i>Too small to hide the sun</i>

742
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:14.265
<i>Almost poking fun</i>

743
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:19.140
<i>At the warm but insecure
Untidy crowd</i>


744
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:24.940
<i>How sweet to be an idiot</i>

745
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:30.870
<i>And dip my brain in joy</i>

746
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:36.946
<i>Children laughing at my back
with no fear of attack</i>


747
00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.705
<i>As much retaliation as a toy</i>

748
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:47.266
<i>How sweet to be an idiot</i>

749
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.987
<i>How sweet</i>

750
00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:04.988
<i>I tiptoe down the street
Smile at everyone I meet</i>


751
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:18.948
<i>But suddenly a scream
Smashes through my dream</i>


752
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:24.220
<i>I smell the blood of an asylum</i>

753
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:27.189
<i>Hey you, you're such a pedant</i>

754
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:30.069
<i>You got as much brain
as a dead ant</i>


755
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.825
<i>As much imagination
As a caravan site</i>


756
00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:38.019
<i>But I still love you</i>

757
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.860
<i>Still love you</i>

758
00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:46.426
<i>How sweet to be an idiot</i>

759
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:50.023
<i>How sweet</i>

760
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.501
<i>How sweet</i>

761
00:50:54.110 --> 00:51:00.300
<i>How sweet</i>

762
00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:25.819
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


763
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:30.302
Have you come to arrange a holiday
or would you like a blowjob?


764
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.420
I'm sorry?

765
00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:39.026
- Oh, you've come to arrange a holiday.
- Yes.


766
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:40.589
Sorry, sorry.

767
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:44.425
Now, where were you thinking
of going?


768
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.988
- To India. Yes.
- One of our adventure holidays.


769
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:49.424
- Yes, that's right.
- Well...


770
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:51.228
...you'd better see Mr. Bounder.

771
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:55.099
Mr. Bounder, this gentleman's
interested in the India overland...


772
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:56.943
...and nothing else.

773
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:04.860
- Hello, I'm Bounder of Adventure.
- Oh, hello...


774
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:06.509
...my name's Smoketoomuch.

775
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:09.386
- What?
- My name is Smoketoomuch.


776
00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:11.427
- Mr. Smoketoomuch.
- Well...


777
00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:14.309
...you'd better cut down a little, then.

778
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:23.027
- I'm sorry?
- You'd better cut down a little, then.


779
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:29.224
Oh, I see. I smoke too much,
so I'd better cut down a little, then.


780
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:33.666
Yes. I bet you get people making jokes
about your name all the time.


781
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:38.506
No, actually, It never struck me before.
Smoketoomuch.


782
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:44.350
Anyway, you're interested
in one of our holidays?


783
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:47.468
Yes, that's right. I saw your advert
in the "blassifled" ads.


784
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.024
- The what?
- In The <i>Times'</i> "blassifled" ads.


785
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:53.101
The <i>Times'</i> classified ads?

786
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:56.262
Yes, that's right.
I'm afraid I have a speech impediment.


787
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:58.307
I can't pronounce the letter B.

788
00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.588
- C.
- Yes, that's right, B.


789
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.381
It's all due to a trauma I suffered
when I was a "sboolboy."


790
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:07.780
I was attacked by a Siamese bat.

791
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:11.663
- A Siamese cat.
- No, a Siamese bat.


792
00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.707
They're more dangerous.

793
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:18.429
- Listen, can you say the letter K?
- Oh, yes.


794
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:23.460
Khakl, kettle, Kipling, Khomeini,
Kellogg's "Born" Flakes.


795
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:28.101
Well, why don't you say the letter K
Instead of the letter C?


796
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:32.385
What, you mean,
pronounce "blassifled" with a K?


797
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:34.461
Yes, absolutely.

798
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:36.822
- Classified.
- Good.


799
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.064
Oh, that's very good.
I never thought of that before.


800
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:42.901
What a silly "bunt.”

801
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.463
- Now then, about the holiday. We have--
- Yes, well...


802
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:50.701
...I've been on package tours
many times.


803
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:53.180
- Your advert really "baught" my eye.
- Jolly good.


804
00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:56.468
What's the point if you're
just gonna be treated like a sheep?


805
00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:00.100
Carted around in buses, surrounded by
oafs from Kettering and "Boventry.”


806
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:02.068
- Absolutely--
- Their "bloth baps"...


807
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:04.949
...their "bardigans" and radios,
"bomplaining" about tea...


808
00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:06.987
...they don't make it properly,
do they?


809
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:09.744
And stopping at endless
bodegas selling fish and chips...


810
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.868
...and Watney's Red Barrel
and calamaris and two veg.


811
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:14.429
Sitting in their sun frocks...

812
00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.104
...squirting Timothy White's
sun cream over puffy...


813
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:20.661
...raw, swollen, purulent flesh because
they overdid it on the first day.


814
00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:23.106
- I know.
- And being herded into wilderness...


815
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:26.262
...Hotel Miramars, and Bellevueses,
and "Bontinentals."


816
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:28.501
Their international luxury
modern roomettes.


817
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:32.300
Pools full of draught Red Barrel.
Fat German businessmen pretending...


818
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:34.268
...to be acrobats
and forming pyramids.


819
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.467
Frightening children
and barging into queues.


820
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.428
If you're not at your table
spot-on 7...


821
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:41.025
...you miss your
Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup...


822
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.466
...the first in the menu
of international cuisine.


823
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.349
- Absolutely. Now--
- Thursday night, there's cabaret...


824
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:50.219
...featuring some tiny,
emaciated dago with 9-inch hips...


825
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:53.303
...and some fat, bloated tart
with her hair Brylcreemed down...


826
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:55.905
...and a big ass presenting
flamenco for foreigners.


827
00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:57.822
- Be quiet.
- Adenoidal typists...


828
00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:01.506
...from Birmingham with flabby legs
and dlarrhoea trying to pick up hairy...


829
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:03.581
...bandy-legged wop waiters
called Manuel.


830
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.310
Once a week there's an excursion
to the Roman remains.


831
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:08.507
You buy cherryade
and melted ice cream.


832
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:10.502
- Quiet. Shut up.
- Watley's Red Barrel.


833
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:14.345
One night they take you to a restaurant
with local atmosphere and colour.


834
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:16.706
You st next to a party from Rhyl
who sing:


835
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:19.100
<i>I love the Costa Brava
I love the Costa Brava</i>


836
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:20.863
Shut up.

837
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:25.299
You get cornered
by some drunken greengrocer...


838
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:28.542
...with an instamatic camera
and last Tuesday's <i>Daily Express</i>.


839
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.590
He goes on about how Ian Smith
should be running the country...


840
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:35.264
...and how many languages
Margaret Powell can speak.


841
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:37.262
She throws up
all over the Cuba Libres.


842
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.660
Then spending four days
at Luton Airport...


843
00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.026
...on a five-day package tour.
Nothing to eat...


844
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.420
...but dry,
British Airways-type sandwiches.


845
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:48.026
You can't get Watley's Red Barrel.
In England, the bloody bar closes...


846
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:49.544
...every time you're thirsty.

847
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:52.907
The kids are crying and vomiting
and breaking the plastic ashtrays.


848
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:55.220
They keep telling you
it'll only be an hour.


849
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:57.347
You know your plane
is still in Iceland.


850
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:59.387
They had to turn back and take--
Shut up.


851
00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:01.382
--Take a party of Swedes
to Yugoslavia...


852
00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:04.269
...before they load you up at 3 a.m.
in the morning.


853
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:07.661
You sit on the tarmac because
there are unforeseen difficulties...


854
00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:10.868
...i.e. the permanent strike
of air-traffic control over Paris.


855
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:12.862
When you finally get
to Málaga airport...


856
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.146
...everybody's queuing
for the bloody toilet.


857
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:17.506
Queuing for the bloody armed
customs officers...


858
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:19.263
...for the bus that isn't there...

859
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:22.309
...waiting to take you
to the hotel that hasn't been built.


860
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:25.144
When you finally get to the half-built
Algerian ruin...


861
00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:28.302
...called the Hotel Del Sol,
by paying half your holiday money...


862
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:31.667
...to a licensed bandit in a taxi,
there's no water in the pool...


863
00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.265
...no water in the bog,
no water in the taps...


864
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:37.821
...there's only a lizard in the bidet
and the rooms are double-booked.


865
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:40.789
You can't sleep because
of the permanent, 24-hour drilling...


866
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:42.987
...of the foundations
of the hotel next door.


867
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.949
Meanwhile, the Spanish National
Tourist Board promises you...


868
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:47.703
...the raging cholera epidemic...

869
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:50.100
...is merely a mild outbreak
of Spanish tummy...


870
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.500
...rather like the previous outbreak
in 1660.


871
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:55.230
Even the bloody rats are dying
from it.


872
00:57:57.110 --> 00:58:00.819
As early as the late 14th century...

873
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:04.187
...or indeed as late
as the early 14th century...


874
00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:06.421
...the earliest forms of jape
were divisible--


875
00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:09.184
Meanwhile, the <i>Guardia</i> are busy
arresting 16-year-olds...


876
00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:10.749
...for kissing in the street.

877
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:13.186
And finally,
the last day in the airport lounge...


878
00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:16.741
...everybody's buying little, awful,
horrid donkeys with their names on...


879
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.106
...and bullfight posters
with their names on...


880
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:22.388
...like Antonio and Mr. Brian Pules
of Norwich.


881
00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:24.826
And then finally, when you get
to bloody Luton...


882
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:30.144
...the flight's grounded for four hours
till they find a plane to take you back.


883
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:32.221
And when you finally
get to Manchester...


884
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:36.270
...there's only another bloody bus
you have to wait 60 years for.


885
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:43.069
As early as the late 14th century...

886
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:46.109
...or indeed as late
as the early 14th century...


887
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:47.783
...the earliest forms of jape...

888
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:52.342
...were divisible into the two categories
into which I now intend to divide them.


889
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:56.868
The earliest manifestation of the basic,
simple precipitation jest incurred...


890
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:59.101
...as will be seen
from the demonstration...


891
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:05.300
...a disproportional amount of internal
risibility on the part of the operator.


892
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:24.547
The secondary
precipitation occurs...


893
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:28.624
...when both protagonist and dupe
are located indoors.


894
00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:31.066
It is true, however,
that this has involved...


895
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:34.507
...the development
of a special piece of machinery.


896
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:40.268
But it is still no more than a simple
variation of primary precipitation.


897
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.424
The opening up
of the African continent...


898
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:09.466
...revealed a vast new source
of wealth for humourous exploitation.


899
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.947
We are to see demonstrated...

900
01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:16.946
...how this was adapted
to the basic precipitation jape.


901
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:58.666
We now come on to a considerate--

902
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:27.501
We now come on
to a consideration...


903
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:31.220
...of the more sophisticated
transitive mode of japing.


904
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:36.783
In which, as we'll observe, the operator
or inceptor remains totally unaware...


905
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.705
...of the humourous implications
of his action.


906
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:52.022
First, we are to see
the simple sideswipe or whop.


907
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:56.344
Hey, Vance.

908
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:08.103
Next, the sideswipe and return.

909
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:11.103
Hey, Vance.

910
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:25.984
And now,
the double-sideswipe and return.


911
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:33.900
Hey, Vance.

912
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:50.590
Popular as this jest has always been,
however...


913
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:53.139
...it cannot compare
with the ribald connotations...


914
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:57.827
...associated with the dispatch
of an edible missile.


915
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:12.503
First, the simple straightforward
offensive deposit.


916
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:34.349
Second, the simple
sideways offensive deposit.


917
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:49.028
Next, the simple surprise deposit.

918
01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:10.460
And now the foul pie.

919
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:24.182
Could we have new pies, please?

920
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:47.623
Finally, we move on to the interesting
but little-known variant...


921
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:52.546
...nominally designated
the three-course complex.


922
01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:15.300
But finally, we must not forget...

923
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:19.100
...the enjoyment, the satisfaction
and the edification...


924
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:22.342
...to be derived from the simple,
straightforward...


925
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:27.823
...sideways,
completely unexpected deposit.


926
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:40.580
<i>Once upon a time, there was
a little house in a dark forest.</i>


927
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:45.950
<i>In this house,
lived a humble woodcutter and his wife.</i>


928
01:05:49.110 --> 01:05:52.501
<i>And their pretty daughter,
Little Red Riding Hood.</i>


929
01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:11.470
<i>And in the middle of this deep,
dark forest, there lived a vicious wolf.</i>


930
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:21.221
<i>One day, Little Red Riding Hood
set off to take some things...</i>


931
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:26.260
<i>...to her old grandmother
who lived deep in the forest.</i>


932
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:44.264
<i>The vicious wolf saw
Little Red Riding Hood and thought:</i>


933
01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:48.424
<i>"She looks very good to eat.</i>

934
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:54.826
<i>Where are you going, my pretty one?"</i>

935
01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.945
<i>"Oh, kind sir. 
To my grandmother's."</i>

936
01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:01.503
<i>Smirked the wicked wolf.</i>

937
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:06.028
<i>And dashed off through the forest
to Grandmother's house.</i>


938
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:11.145
<i>Knock, knock, knock
went the wicked wolf.</i>


939
01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:12.869
<i>The door opened wide.</i>

940
01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.101
<i>But it wasn't Grandmother
who opened it.</i>


941
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:20.265
<i>It was Buzz Aldrin,
America's number two spaceman.</i>


942
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.980
<i>For this was not
Granny's little house at all...</i>


943
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:29.270
<i>...but the headquarters of NASA,
the American space research agency.</i>


944
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:34.139
<i>The wicked wolf
was shot by security guards.</i>


945
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:39.983
<i>So all was quiet in the forest again.</i>

946
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:42.982
<i>The humble woodcutter
and his wife...</i>


947
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:48.384
<i>...sold their story to</i> Der Spiegel
<i>for 40,000 Deutschmarks.</i>


948
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:53.227
<i>NASA agreed to limit the number of
nuclear tests in Granny's little house...</i>


949
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:57.782
<i>...to two on Thursdays
and one on Saturdays after tea.</i>


950
01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:05.388
Liberal rubbish.

951
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:08.906
What do you want
with your jugged fish, Klaus?


952
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:12.226
Pardon, my wide-thighed plum?

953
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:17.220
What do you want with
your jugged fish, you cloth-eared git.


954
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:19.023
Halibut.

955
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:21.261
A jugged fish is halibut.

956
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:26.419
All right. Well, what fish do you have
that is not jugged?


957
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:28.228
Rabbit.

958
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:30.986
What, rabbit fish?

959
01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:33.830
Nice, all covered in fur.

960
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:35.589
Well, is it dead?

961
01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:39.545
Well, it was coughing up blood
last night.


962
01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:43.501
All right. I'll have
the dead, unjugged, rabbit fish.


963
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:50.141
- Appalling.
- You're always complaining.


964
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:51.584
What's for afterwards?

965
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:57.621
Well, there's rat pie, rat pudding,
rat sorbet...


966
01:08:57.790 --> 01:09:00.942
...or strawberry tart.

967
01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:02.868
Strawberry tart?

968
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:06.381
Well, it's got some rat in it.

969
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:11.179
- How much?
- Six.


970
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:13.945
Rather lot, really.

971
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:16.983
I'll have a slice
without so much rat in it.


972
01:09:23.190 --> 01:09:25.466
Appalling.

973
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:29.108
Moan, moan, moan.

974
01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:31.984
- Hello, Mum. Hello, Dad.
- Hello, son.


975
01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:35.069
There's a dead bishop on the landing.

976
01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:37.585
- Where is he from?
- What do you mean?


977
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.661
What's his diocese?

978
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:41.941
Well, he looked
a bit Canterbury-ish to me.


979
01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:43.299
I'll go and have a look.

980
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.461
I don't know who keeps
bringing them here.


981
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:46.700
Well, it's not me.

982
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:49.339
I put three out by the trash cans
last week.


983
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:51.706
The garbage men won't touch them.

984
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:53.781
It's the bishop of Leicester.

985
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:57.022
- How do you know?
- Tattooed on the back of his neck.


986
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:59.383
1 think I'd better call the police.

987
01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:02.110
- Shouldn't you call the church?
- Call the church police.


988
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:04.068
That's a good idea.

989
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:07.865
The church police.

990
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:12.179
Hello, hello, hello.

991
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:32.824
What's all this, then? Amen.

992
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:37.342
- Are you the church police?
- Oh, yes.


993
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:40.741
There's another dead bishop
on the landing, vicar-sergeant.


994
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:43.510
Detective-parson, madam.

995
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:47.307
- What Is It, R.C. or C. of E.?
- How should I know?


996
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.468
Tattooed on the back of their neck.

997
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:52.428
Here.

998
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:56.060
Is that rat tart?

999
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.587
Yes.

1000
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:04.542
Disgusting. Right, men.

1001
01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:08.590
The hunt is on.
Let us kneel In prayer.


1002
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:09.899
Oh, Lord.

1003
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:13.108
Oh, Lord. We beseech thee.

1004
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:18.026
Tell us who croaked
the bishop of Leicester.


1005
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:34.067
The one in the braces. He done it.

1006
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:45.069
- It's a fair cop, but society is to blame.
- Right. We'll arrest them instead.


1007
01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:50.464
Come on, you. Are you in society?
Are you in society?


1008
01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:54.427
Right. We'd like to conclude
this arrest with an hymn.


1009
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:08.060
I never wanted to be
in such a shambolic sketch.


1010
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:17.986
I always wanted to be a lumberjack.

1011
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:27.501
Leaping from tree to tree.

1012
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:34.102
As they float down
the mighty rivers of British Columbia.


1013
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:40.346
The larch, the redwood,
the mighty sequoia.


1014
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:44.185
With my best girl by my side.

1015
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:48.580
The giant deadwood, the spruce.

1016
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:53.703
The little Californian rude tree.

1017
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:59.739
We sing, sing, sing.

1018
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:07.262
<i>I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay
I sleep all night and I work all day</i>


1019
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:12.630
<i>He's a lumberjack and he's okay
He sleeps all night and he works all day</i>


1020
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:17.944
<i>I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
I go to the lavatory</i>


1021
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:23.742
