1
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.138
The universe is a clock

2
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.186
wound since the beginning of Time,

3
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.540
of Everything

4
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.309
each spiral, each galaxy,
each star and planet


5
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.149
whirls and spins it's eternal revolutions

6
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.069
held in place by forces straining

7
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.229
inconstant competition,

8
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.229
balanced, one against the other

9
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.389
slowly, slowly,

10
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.346
running down.

11
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.709
Some philosophers have
seen the image of a clock


12
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.259
as the nearest we can come
to a metaphor for perfect creation,


13
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.981
absolute craft.

14
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.465
Each 'tick' immaculately geared to the next

15
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.187
each 'tock' the answering equivalent.

16
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.269
Behind the face, behind the hands,

17
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.830
is a Universe-in miniature

18
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.545
The Cosmos in a casing.

19
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.469
Balances, bridges, escapements and stems,

20
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.429
turning and springing,
releasing and rolling,


21
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.228
This is the language of time.

22
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.588
Not 'the time'...

23
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.510
TIME.

24
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.503
Once upon a time,

25
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.262
there was a man
who held the Universe in his top pocket.


26
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.429
A universe encased in solid gold,

27
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.269
and crafted entirely by his own two hands.

28
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.909
Big, plate-like hands

29
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.301
hands that were engineered to rebore
the engine of his beloved Bentley,


30
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.628
rather than crafting beautiful,
intricate timepieces.


31
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.228
Yet this passionate, dedicated man

32
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.628
had the vision that was to
make him Master of his trade.


33
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.468
He became known as
the world's greatest living Watchmaker.


34
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.109
For George Daniels, almost any universe

35
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.905
would have been more welcome
than the one he was born into.


36
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.899
A childhood of Dickensian
neglect and poverty.


37
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.462
In a crowded, unruly, unpredictable world,

38
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.863
he became tough, inventive,
sharp and strong.


39
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.949
And then, inexplicably,

40
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.747
an object of great importance
appears in his life,


41
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.228
something quite magical,

42
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.060
something that should not have been a part
of the world he inhabited:


43
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.540
A Pocket Watch.

44
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.269
It is ordered, self contained,

45
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.342
self controlled, self regulating,

46
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.941
and utterly beguiling.

47
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.222
And for the incredible journey
this watch will take him on,


48
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.989
it might as well have
been dropped at his feet


49
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.989
by a fabled white rabbit,

50
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.269
racing onwards to another,

51
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.545
curiouser world.

52
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.861
But... it didn't work

53
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.347
For all its beautiful complexity,

54
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.820
it lacked the movement
that made sense of it's engineering.


55
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.219
So...

56
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.583
he turned to the only
other time piece available


57
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.389
When he takes apart the family alarm clock

58
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.779
it's a dangerous thing to do,

59
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.582
because his parents use that alarm clock.

60
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.829
If they come home
and see him doing that,

61
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.829
he is bound to get a ferocious beating.

62
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.786
But he doesn't care.

63
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.745
He is so driven by this
intense curiosity to see


64
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.906
what is inside that clock.

65
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.068
It reflected his own view of life.

66
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.269
It was independent,

67
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.669
it functioned without
any outside interference


68
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.864
or outside help.

69
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.226
Watches and clocks just stood there,

70
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.421
ticking away.

71
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.429
One of George's greatest achievements

72
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.786
was his invention of
the co-axial escapement,


73
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.183
the first new horological
development in 250 years


74
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.464
and widely accepted as
the most important of the 20th Century.


75
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.229
It took years of focussed, intense effort

76
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.789
to get from that first broken pocket watch

77
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.099
to Master Watchmaker.

78
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.829
But his survivor's instinct

79
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.788
and his obsession with
the mechanical combined,


80
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.659
and from unforgiving materials,

81
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.140
he crafted his life.

82
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.549
As a boy,

83
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.543
I didn't really understand
the purpose of school.


84
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.060
My parents were very keen
that I did very well at school


85
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.982
but I didn't really understand why.

86
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.659
Like wise going through school,

87
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.429
I had very little
awareness of what went on

88
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.386
outside of school life.

89
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.509
I know that at school I
was always very practical:


90
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.068
I always made models-

91
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.469
balsa wood models which I enjoyed making

92
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.869
and always trying to perfect,

93
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.062
but it really wasn't
until my father suggested


94
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.023
that I go on the horology
course in Manchester...


95
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.662
We talked about restoring antique furniture

96
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.383
and he was very keen on that.

97
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.229
So we applied to the school in Manchester,

98
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.549
but unfortunately,

99
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.188
as our application went in,

100
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.662
they decided to cancel the course.
Forever, you know.


101
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.424
So, had to think again

102
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.102
and, in the Manchester
Evening News, I saw this


103
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.507
article about the School
of Horology in Manchester.


104
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.698
I was quite interested in that myself.

105
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.220
It seemed very, very
good, and I came back

106
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.869
and I mentioned it to him

107
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.030
and he said yes, he would
be interested in doing that.


108
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.948
He was full of enthusiasm.

109
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.062
My first day at college

110
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.589
was really my best day of education ever.

111
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.739
It was fantastic.

112
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.545
Really, my life started at that point,

113
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.109
that was a real awakening I suppose.

114
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.109
And from that moment onwards I knew

115
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.109
that this was going to be my life:

116
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.110
Watches, or clocks.

117
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.549
I didn't know what at that point

118
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.620
but I knew it was going
to be one of those two.


119
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.583
After he'd only been at this
Horology School for about a week,


120
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.978
and he was full of enthusiasm,

121
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.982
he'd skeletonised this pocket watch,

122
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.580
which I thought, you know, was pretty keen

123
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.310
he'd done it all in his spare time-

124
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.786
then one evening he wanted to
have a look at a clock.


125
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.109
So he found one of
ours, and he sort of

126
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.109
took it to pieces, took the plates apart,

127
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.509
all the wheels dropped out,

128
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.029
about eight wheels,

129
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.429
with pinions on each end,

130
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.704
fitting between the plates.

131
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.630
So I said 'That's very good,
but what are you going to do now Roger?'


132
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.109
'I don't know!' he said.

133
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.902
'Well I suggest you put it together.'

134
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.909
Knowing that he wouldn't
be able to do this.


135
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.869
But he picked up
one plate in his lefthand,

136
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.385
and just picked these wheels up,

137
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.989
'that one goes there,
that one goes there...


138
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.429
'and that one goes there...'

139
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.429
all eight wheels went in,

140
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.909
and then he just shut it.

141
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.219
Every wheel had gone into
the right pinion hole.


142
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.229
So it seemed the restless young schoolboy

143
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.186
who was so unsure of his future,

144
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.947
had stumbled upon his destiny.

145
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.990
All great watchmakers are historians.

146
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:54.902
All great watchmakers are historians.

147
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.625
All great watchmakers know
what came before them,


148
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.589
and they tease out of that knowledge

149
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.870
a way forward for themselves.

150
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.147
It starts with the sun.

151
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.864
The great 'sky clock'
was the first regulator,


152
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.309
marking the time when men could hunt,

153
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.309
fish, plant,

154
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.310
or harvest.

155
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.469
Its time in the heavens

156
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.426
determined by the seasons.

157
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.624
But as soon as the regularity
of these phases was noted,


158
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.069
they were measured.

159
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.984
And as soon as measured, put to use.

160
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.829
As every nation developed,

161
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.786
newer technologies were needed.

162
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.829
In navigation, clocks became symbolic of

163
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.822
mankind's ability to
conquer the natural world.


164
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.669
In England, ships were being lost at sea,

165
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.184
well, even around the world
were being lost at sea.


166
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.703
A man called John Harrison,

167
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.789
a very famous English watchmaker,

168
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.509
he managed to create
the very first accurate timekeepers,


169
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.221
which enabled navigators to locate
their position at sea.


170
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.549
But as societies advanced,

171
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.189
as things improved,

172
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.340
from the ships in the 1600's

173
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.269
and through to industrial revolution,

174
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.149
when the railways came,

175
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.869
then obviously, to have a time base

176
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:22.308
was important across the meridian
and in time zones


177
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.469
so everybody knew that time was the same.

178
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.506
As industrialisation took hold,

179
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.060
the mechanisation of human life took over

180
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.707
and time became the possession
of the factory owner.


181
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.225
Lengths of days were irrelevant:

182
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.502
It was hours worked that mattered.

183
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.309
And suddenly,
your common man needed to make sure


184
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.379
he was at work on time

185
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.660
and that's where mass production started.

186
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.028
And so for the common man,

187
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.589
they became common place.

188
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.189
Whatever symbolic
influence they could claim


189
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.629
was reduced still further
with digital devices


190
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.029
that could tell the time
within millionths of a second,


191
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.669
using a bit of quartz and a battery.

192
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.267
The mechanical timepiece
was made redundant.


193
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.788
From looking at the sky to
gauge our place in the day,


194
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.149
we can see the time anywhere.

195
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.749
We are pursued by beeps and digits,

196
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.749
mobiles and tablets,

197
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.309
PCs and computers,

198
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.909
all of them remote devices

199
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.189
clicking precisely,

200
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.307
showing the numbers
that equate to the time.


201
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.110
And yet...

202
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.029
The position of the hands on the face,

203
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.544
is a far more instinctive
statement of the time.


204
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.069
They represent the
cyclical nature of it all,


205
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.189
from the turning sun to all its sons:

206
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.469
The days, the weeks the seasons,

207
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.426
our lives and deaths.

208
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.390
Time ticks in our veins.

209
00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.988
But the success of the digital revolution

210
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.302
was overwhelming.

211
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.349
It takes a particular kind of cussedness

212
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.910
to change the way mankind is moving.

213
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.349
After seeing the world
of mechanical watches


214
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.306
brought close to dissolution,

215
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.669
George Daniels decided

216
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.626
that the world was wrong

217
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.069
and almost single handedly

218
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:27.224
he revived the craft
of creating handmade timepieces.


219
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.183
He started repairing, restoring,

220
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.589
became an agent for Breguet in London,

221
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.299
and actually made Breguet clocks.

222
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.787
He made two 3-wheel clocks:
Very, very sought after.


223
00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.869
Abraham-Louis Breguet
was a very famous French watchmaker.


224
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.545
I suppose he saw the
quality of Breguet's work


225
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.867
and he thought he could improve on it
which quite clearly he did


226
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.545
with the double wheel escapement
and the co-axial escapement.


227
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.429
A timepiece has it's own ticking heart:

228
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.429
The escapement.

229
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:24.503
A life-giving mechanism
of balance wheels and levers


230
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.538
that transfer energy to
the time-keeping elements of the machine.


231
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.669
They bring it to life.

232
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.706
Many great watchmakers have tried
to perfect this device,


233
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.663
not only to make this heart
stronger and more stable


234
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.184
but to make clocks and watches
more and more accurate.


235
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.378
For two hundred and fifty years

236
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.465
it was Mudge's lever escapement
that reigned supreme.


237
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.070
That is,

238
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.342
until George Daniels decided
he could do better...


239
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.900
You're hard at work I see!

240
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.659
Can you tell me how
you go about all this?

241
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.865
Well, it depends on a
variety of circumstances,


242
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.222
and of course first, one
needs to have the incentive


243
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.869
to make a watch

244
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.466
and usually one thinks of a new idea
or an innovation


245
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.902
that might help effect
an improvement in rate.


246
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.459
- Those are ruby jewels?
- Ruby jewels, yes.


247
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.900
I make those on this
little machine over here,


248
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.349
cut them to my own shapes.

249
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.629
This tooth is locked on the locking stone,

250
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.149
the balance will turn to the right,

251
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.300
carry the lever with it, unlock this wheel,

252
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.710
which will fall onto that stone,

253
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.509
while the tooth here
will fall onto that impulse pallet.


254
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.869
So, it's a fairly fast
moving, complex action.


255
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.909
But I think it will add charm to the watch
when it's completed.


256
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.629
Totally unique George!

257
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.746
Well, it is unique, one only hopes

258
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.179
that it proves beneficial in the end.

259
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.429
You see here are the basic components...

260
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.660
George realised that there was

261
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.140
a fundamental flaw with
the lever escapement,


262
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.860
which is used in all
mechanical watches to date.


263
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.909
And the main problem
with the lever escapement is that


264
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.869
it requires lubrication
in order for it to function correctly.


265
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.349
You do figure all the angles

266
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.029
Well that's vitally important

267
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.180
Precision timekeeping only comes

268
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.020
from meticulously observing
certain functions of the escapement,


269
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.222
if you don't do that, the watch
won't give off it's best performance.


270
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.469
The problem with all lubrication

271
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.509
is that after time its
condition will deteriorate.


272
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.389
Eventually the tooth will find it harder

273
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.346
to push through the thickening oil.

274
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.509
And, because it's now
harder to push through,


275
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.468
it'll affect the rate of
timekeeping of the watch.


276
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.909
So George saw this as being

277
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.866
the major problem with the lever escapement

278
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.269
and what he set about doing was

279
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.269
trying to redesign an escapement

280
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.226
to avoid this sliding action.

281
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.387
George, spent a lot of time

282
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.989
reviving the mechanical watch industry.

283
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.142
And now, the majority of Omega watches
throughout the world


284
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.068
have got George's co-axial escapement.

285
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.349
I was fortunate enough
to meet him in the 1960s


286
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.306
when I first started my career

287
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.709
with a firm called
Camerer Cuss and Company.


288
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.709
I met George

289
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.949
when he used to come in
and talk to old Mr Cuss


290
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.906
about watches and all sorts of things.

291
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.189
So I was thrilled
when I eventually joined Sotheby's


292
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.429
in the late 1970s

293
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.386
to find George was the consultant

294
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.989
and we were able to start
up our relationship again.


295
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.948
He would regularly come
in and have a chat

296
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.589
about his clocks and his watches

297
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.189
and his cars as well.

298
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.469
He'd often bring a watch
that he'd just made to show us.


299
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.189
It was thrilling! We'd all say

300
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.863
'Oh what have you got George?
What's in that pocket?'


301
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.949
It's the fact that he's the
first person for so long


302
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.066
to have produced everything;

303
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.189
every part of the watch, I believe,

304
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.469
apart from the springs

305
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.469
but everything else:

306
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.859
The dials, the cases, the movements.

307
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.344
Nobody else has done that.

308
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.789
No, it's quite remarkable.

309
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.027
Especially as they were
such complicated watches.


310
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.509
I think the ferociousness
that George applied to work,


311
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.466
comes from his childhood.

312
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.389
It was a way he escaped the violence,

313
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.389
he escaped hunger,

314
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.389
he escaped abuse.

315
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.779
He just disappeared into work.

316
00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.749
It's a lonely job. If
you look at Riversdale,


317
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.109
when George lived in
Riversdale all by himself,


318
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.783
cooked his meal in the evening,
watched his television,


319
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.069
had lots of visitors,

320
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.309
the house was always alive in that respect.

321
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.309
But when he was in the workshop-no.

322
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.989
Dedicated. Sit in the workshop by himself,

323
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.218
fan heater on,

324
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.909
and work.

325
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.866
And that's how he did it.

326
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.829
George has been heralded as a genius,

327
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.140
a pioneer with a visionary spirit.

328
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.338
The recipient of countless medals
and awards from his peers,


329
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.940
Daniels now ranks among
the horological greats


330
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.547
that he himself was once in awe of.

331
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:22.229
He single-handedly influenced
the entire horological industry


332
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.027
and will go down in history

333
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.460
as one of the Greatest
Watchmakers of all time.


334
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.829
I first met George
when I was at the college in Manchester,


335
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.264
studying to be a watch and clock repairer

336
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.748
and at that point I didn't
think it was possible


337
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.946
for one person to make a watch.

338
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.589
George came along, and he brought out

339
00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.787
this wonderful pocket
watch, 'The SpaceTraveller'


340
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.142
and, on looking at this piece,
you know, I just thought


341
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.467
'What an incredible achievement!
How on earth is it possible? '


342
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.709
Actually, my father, he bought me

343
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:13.385
for that Christmas,
a copy of George's book 'Watchmaking'.


344
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.149
In it, it tells you how
to make a pocket watch


345
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.708
from start to finish.

346
00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.460
On reading the book from
cover to cover several times


347
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.741
I finally realised -

348
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.983
I mean, the book is written so well
and it's so easy to understand,


349
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.349
but I thought well, if
George could make a watch,


350
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.181
then surely I could make a watch?

351
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.983
I approached George
and asked if he would apprentice me.


352
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.549
Anyway, he invited me over to the Island,

353
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.983
told me that he wouldn't,

354
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.021
but nevertheless encouraged me and said

355
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.464
'If you want to make watches,

356
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.789
go away and start
working on one of your own'


357
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.746
He said nobody taught him to do it,

358
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.102
so it is possible.

359
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.709
Upon completing college

360
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.549
Roger went to work at Tag Heuer

361
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.941
and likewise, a year later,
I went and joined him there.


362
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.149
After working full time
probably for 18 months


363
00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.749
he went to the company

364
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.309
asked to reduce his hours
to 2 or 3 days a week,


365
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.309
to concentrate on the completion
of his first pocket watch.


366
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.269
Unfortunately, they declined his offer.

367
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.229
So he literally left,
and he found trade work


368
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.229
to fill the gaps and earn the money,

369
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.869
and he completed that first pocket watch
when he was 22,


370
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.658
which was a 'tourbillon', and
that really is unheard of.


371
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.624
Roger is very precise.

372
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.029
He's got endless patience,

373
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.986
sort of an abnormal degree of patience!

374
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.149
When he was at home, when he'd qualified

375
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.984
and he was working
for a watch repair business in Bolton,


376
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.139
in his spare time he
was making a watch -

377
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.666
this one he was hoping to
take to see George Daniels.


378
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.860
I was just earning enough basically
give my parents a bit of rent


379
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.029
pay a loan off for equipment-

380
00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.909
I didn't have any spare money basically,

381
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.138
it was a very basic lifestyle.

382
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.989
But I needed to
be cause I was working

383
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.584
12 to 14 hours a
day, 6 days a week

384
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.108
He sets up in his parents garage,

385
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.349
works at making a watch
3 or 4days a week,

386
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:17.349
and the other days of the week

387
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.029
he works at repairs so
he can earn some money.


388
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.385
Now this is remarkably
like what George did.


389
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.429
The first watch I started making
in my father's garage


390
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.229
I chopped a bit out of it,

391
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:36.350
and made a little room
only about 10 foot by 6 or 7 foot.


392
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.303
I'd never made components
for a watch before.


393
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.987
But nevertheless I had George's
book 'Watchmaking' to help me.


394
00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.904
He'd spend all day
making a tiny little part


395
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.379
and then he'd come in,
in the evening, and say


396
00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.662
'I've lost it.' I'd say 'What
do you mean you've lost it?'


397
00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.901
'It's on the floor
somewhere, can't find it.'


398
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.066
Most people would just
go out of their minds!


399
00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.550
'Well what are you going to do?'

400
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.270
And he'd say 'I'll
have to make it again.'

401
00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.429
And sometimes that happened maybe-

402
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.749
I'm not exaggerating! - 2 or 3 times.

403
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.184
Three days totally wasted work.

404
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.861
He just took it all on
the chin, so to speak.


405
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.469
It was very difficult, because

406
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.469
I didn't know how to treat
the materials that I had to work on.


407
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.949
Also, I was learning 32 individual trades

408
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.149
which no watchmaker,
other than George Daniels,


409
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.699
and one or two others
have ever learned, ever achieved.


410
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.869
But nevertheless a watch did come together.

411
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.338
I think the whole process
took about 18 months.


412
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.584
And it was a surprise
when the watch ticked...


413
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.669
and it really only did just tick!

414
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.949
Two years later he goes back to George

415
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:51.501
after having spent three thousand
five hundred hours making a watch.


416
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.509
It only just worked really.

417
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.509
It was a bit hit and miss

418
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.219
and I was nervous that it may stop
while it was in George's hands.


419
00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.029
But, anyway, he had a look at it.
But he wasn't happy.


420
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.589
You could just tell.
I mean, I was hoping

421
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.589
that his face would light
up and say 'Well done',


422
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.590
but,

423
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:09.979
well he was honest!

424
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.949
He was a bit annoyed really,

425
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.545
that I'd gone over there
and wasted his time


426
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.065
showing him this watch which was

427
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.744
no good.

428
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.229
Now the thing worked, it told the time,

429
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.869
you would think that would be enough?

430
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.349
Not for George.

431
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.784
Telling the time was
never enough for George.


432
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.149
George looked at it and said

433
00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.469
'Go away and finish it
properly, it's all about finish'


434
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:58.669
It looked handmade, not created.

435
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.669
George always believed

436
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.909
you should never see
the hand of the maker

437
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.866
in any mechanical object.

438
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.467
The mark of the maker
has to be completely washed away.


439
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.469
He sent me away, with a
bit of a flea in my ear,


440
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.826
and told me to make another watch.

441
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.899
Being told that you can't do something

442
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.908
then I immediately want to go out
and prove that I can do it.


443
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.025
I just wasn't prepared to let it go.

444
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.509
Making the first watch
took a year and a half,


445
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.899
but the second watch, 
I thought, well

446
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.628
if I'm going to spend so much time

447
00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.269
learning and perfecting how to make it,

448
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.226
then I have to make it more complicated.

449
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.979
And so I added

450
00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.141
a four year perpetual
calendar mechanism on to it.


451
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.301
So it adjusts for every single month,

452
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.309
and then it self-corrects
for the long and shorts,


453
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.069
and also it corrects for your leap year.

454
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.069
So it's a very complicated piece!

455
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.026
But I felt that

456
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:18.509
that extra complication would give me
the opportunity to practice


457
00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.466
and improve the skills that

458
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.701
I was so obviously lacking really.

459
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.469
Roger was willing to gamble with

460
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.426
the most important thing in life-time.

461
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.420
He was willing to gamble
that he could make a great watch.


462
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.069
That is an enormous gamble,

463
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.509
particularly when you're in your early 20s

464
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.308
and you're making tourbillons
and perpetual calendars.


465
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.269
The life of a Master Watchmaker

466
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.269
is a lonely one.

467
00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.269
Hours upon hours, minutes upon minutes,

468
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.625
seconds upon milliseconds,

469
00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.469
forming and soldering and turning,

470
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.909
tempering and bleaching and buckle making,

471
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.429
springing and timing and finishing and-

472
00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.429
well the list goes on.

473
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.629
And on... and on.

474
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.229
Everything created to a standard

475
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.063
that Chronos himself would be pleased with.

476
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:11.029
These two men

477
00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:14.549
chose to dedicate almost
every waking second


478
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.666
to perfecting this ancient art.

479
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.829
Indeed, even in slumber
they would surely dream


480
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.069
of shaving that last slip of time loss

481
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.026
from their latest mechanism,

482
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.467
creating the ultimate Time Machine.

483
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.789
This is a skill set that
devours the sunlight


484
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.458
for those who choose to master it.

485
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.902
It is an art that is, ironically, timeless,

486
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:42.022
but one that would have faded
into the annals of history


487
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:47.549
had George not taken it upon himself
to 'rewind the clock' once more.


488
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.149
And, had the fiery, determined,
young Roger not taken the bait


489
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.149
of the challenge laid out before him,

490
00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.869
to snatch the baton waved at him,

491
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.462
and run with it.

492
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.749
They shared an unshakeable obsession

493
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.706
and an immoveable focus.

494
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.229
And yet, like any great pocket watch,

495
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:11.789
these two characters have more
layers and levels to their complication


496
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.590
than you might at first think.

497
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.786
He did say,

498
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.829
that when he was a watchmaker,

499
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.229
a man learning the trade repairing watches,

500
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.229
he had few friends.

501
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.229
As soon as he bought a vintage Bentley,

502
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.425
he had a hundred friends.

503
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.349
Oh! Rebuild cars?

504
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.747
He was skilled at the
workbench making watches


505
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:08.426
but he's just as skilled
repairing Bentleys.


506
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.829
He was dedicated in everything he did

507
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.069
Whether it was cars, motorbikes, watches,

508
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.549
clocks or writing.

509
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.549
George would buy a car,

510
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.709
which you and I would
accept as being perfect,


511
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.709
and would rebuild it.

512
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.749
He didn't want any hiccups along the way,

513
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.706
he wanted to have a perfect car.

514
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.789
He didn't win a lot of races, but

515
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.749
every race he took
part in, they were fun.

516
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.706
He would nearly always

517
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:23.229
end up sideways on the grass, spinning.

518
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.469
'Fear' was something that George Daniels

519
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.029
actually didn't recognise.

520
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.863
It was very hard keeping
up with George in this car


521
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.988
if you had something not quite as fast-

522
00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.789
- he was gone, like the wind.

523
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.746
We had some very good outings together

524
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.947
and some hair-raising experiences.

525
00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.425
The nearest I've ever
come to death, I think, is


526
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:46.186
being driven in the
Itala by George Daniels!


527
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.986
But that was George.

528
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.869
He just didn't go out there to win,

529
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.862
he went out there for
the camaraderie, the fun.


530
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:13.306
It's a privilege to drive
these wonderful machines.


531
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:34.069
The watchmaker openly professed

532
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.349
that he did not have the necessary patience

533
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.625
required to give personal instruction.

534
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.942
He claimed it was because
he worked too quickly.


535
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.540
He did not want the
burden of an apprentice.


536
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.909
Disparaging about what he saw as the

537
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.389
pervading philosophy of a '9 to 5'culture,

538
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:54.781
George always believed
that success required great application


539
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:58.505
and total disregard of the passing hours.

540
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.309
And yet,

541
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.309
somewhere not too far away,

542
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.109
one determined young man,

543
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.340
evidently cut from a similar cloth,

544
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:10.186
refused to take '
No' for an answer.

545
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:21.349
The second watch that I made
was the tourbillon pocket watch


546
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.665
and it had a perpetual calendar on it.

547
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:28.349
It was that watch that I
was making and remaking


548
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.109
over a five and half year period,

549
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.109
and basically, at the
end of the first year,


550
00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.709
I found that the components
that I'd just recently made


551
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.989
were of a far poorer quality,

552
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.629
so I'd go back to the beginning
of the watch and remake it.


553
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.909
Eventually - well, 
I think my parents

554
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.669
were running out of patience with me

555
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.820
because I was still living
and working at home,


556
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:51.308
and I think I'd
also got to the stage

557
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:55.543
where I knew I just couldn't physically
improve on what I was making.


558
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.820
The quality of the parts
I was very happy with.


559
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:02.509
So it came to the time when
I had to contact George,


560
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.706
and arrange another
visit to the Isle of Man


561
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.109
to show him the watch.

562
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.749
I think in my mind, I'd sort of
thought that if this didn't work,


563
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.309
if this watch wasn't right, then really,

564
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.222
watchmaking for me was sort of finished.

565
00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:21.026
I knew I couldn't really
physically improve on that


566
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.586
so a lot hung on this particular meeting.

567
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.109
I arrived at the allotted
time at the house,


568
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.668
and he invited me in,

569
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.469
into his kitchen, where he
does all his paper work;


570
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.059
this big desk where all
his papers were spread out,


571
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.389
and he just told
me to stand and wait

572
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.390
by the door there.

573
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.829
Anyway, he continued doing his paperwork,

574
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:48.789
shuffling bits of paper around
and didn't say anything to me.


575
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.350
And that continued for
about five or ten minutes.


576
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:56.669
Eventually he said 'Right!
Let's look at this watch.'


577
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.669
So he said 'Follow me'.

578
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.269
We left the house and
walked down to the workshop.


579
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.226
On the way, he said:

580
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.069
'Your first watch was
terrible, wasn't it? ',


581
00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.026
he said:'I think you knew it was terrible,

582
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:12.109
I don't know what you were doing
trying to show it to me,


583
00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.109
what were you trying to prove? '

584
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.789
how do you reply to that?!

585
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.829
I thought 'this isn't good!'

586
00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.829
But anyway, we got into the workshop,

587
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:25.699
I followed him in here,
and George sat down at the bench, there


588
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.989
and I basically just stood

589
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.946
sort of to his left,

590
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.269
and I put the watch down there,

591
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.419
where that pen is.

592
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.749
And he opened the box.

593
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.269
He wasn't very impressed with the box,

594
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.749
he isn't impressed with boxes.

595
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.309
He took out the pocket watch and

596
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.266
he just held it in his hand,

597
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.829
he put his glasses on

598
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.343
and his magnifying glass,

599
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.741
and he just turned it over in his hands,
and looked at it.


600
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.149
And then he said:
'Who made the pocket watch case for you?'


601
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.106
So I said:'I did'.

602
00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.989
Than he turned it around
and he looked and the dial,


603
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:01.989
and he said:'Where did
you get the dial made?'


604
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:03.946
So I said:'Well I made the dial'.

605
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.509
And he turned it
around a bit more, then

606
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.466
he opened the back of the watch-

607
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.589
at this point my heart was just

608
00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.229
pumping ten to the dozen, you know?

609
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.186
I mean, this was the moment really.

610
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.263
Then he looked at the
mechanism and he said:


611
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:21.189
'Who made the tourbillon carriage for you?'

612
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.418
So I said:'I did'.

613
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.621
Then he looked at the
escape wheel and said:


614
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:25.865
'Very nice escape wheel,

615
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.543
where did you get that from?'

616
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.180
So I said:'I made it George!'

617
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.349
And with that, he
just snapped the back to,

618
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.149
put the watch down, stood up,

619
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:38.108
and he said:'Congratulations,
you're a watchmaker!'


620
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.586
I didn't listen to anything he said
for the next 15 or 20 minutes


621
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.869
as he just paraded around the workshop,
talking really animatedly


622
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.826
and I've never seen this man like that!

623
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.549
He was just talking about watches,

624
00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:01.509
horology and his work,
and my possible future.


625
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.389
My mind was just whirling away, you know?

626
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.062
Here was the end of a seven,

627
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.144
a seven and a
half year sort of quest,

628
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.909
to prove to this man that
I could make a watch.


629
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.866
That was something special.

630
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.469
And so it seemed the solitary watchmaker

631
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.698
was finally relenting.

632
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.109
He gained a worthy apprentice
to join him on his journey,


633
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.068
with whom he could share
his ancient wisdom -


634
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.948
the secret of Time.

635
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.909
In the middle of the Irish Sea,

636
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:05.664
the Isle of Man stands
at the very centre of the British Isles.


637
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.109
It is independent in attitude,

638
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.066
as much as by constitution.

639
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:15.186
And has been quietly radical
for over a thousand years.


640
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:23.389
The past breathes through
the hills, and the shores


641
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:25.346
and the soil.

642
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:39.029
Upon the sails of their dragon ships,

643
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.022
the Norse settlers brought with them
the Triskellion symbol,


644
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:47.789
which is, to this day, embroidered on the
Island's flags as the Three Legs of Man.


645
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.269
It denotes a turning sun -

646
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:53.626
as apt a metaphor as any
watchmaker could wish for.


647
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:59.867
It is a symbol which is engraved
on each of Roger's watches.


648
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.909
Perhaps it was the sum of
all its parts and paradoxes


649
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.378
that made the Isle
of Man the perfect home.

650
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:16.069
Or perhaps George Daniels,
Master Watchmaker,


651
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.026
and Keeper of Time,

652
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:23.181
was simply seduced by
the Islanders' most loved phrase:


653
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.627
'Traa Dy Liaoor',

654
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.908
meaning:'Time Enough'.

655
00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.149
In 1999,

656
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:45.669
George started the Millennium Project,

657
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.549
and asked Roger to come
to the Island and assist.


658
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.949
I think we were
in France at the time.

659
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.305
He rang up and said George
had been on the phone,


660
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.546
George Daniels, offered him a job,

661
00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.709
and he said:'I've accepted'
and I said: 'That's great!'


662
00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.549
Well it really was,

663
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.666
because I didn't think
that would ever happen.


664
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.109
Obviously due to his
age he needed the help,


665
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.429
but also he wanted to

666
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.509
pass on the experiences

667
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.306
and the skills which he'd
developed over the years.


668
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.669
George had invented this escapement
which Omega had taken on board,


669
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:37.745
and he wanted to create a series of watches
around this, this new invention of his.


670
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.469
And so I came over
to the Isle of Man

671
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:45.429
and started work on assisting George.

672
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:19.229
He saw in Roger obsession,

673
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:22.029
gambler, and rebel.

674
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.509
And that is what he
saw in himself as well.

675
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.269
So, seeing that in Roger,
was very comforting for George,


676
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:33.269
knowing there was another
generation after him.


677
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.109
It's like that scene in
'Star Wars', you know?


678
00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.589
Where Yoda says
'No it's alright, there will be another'


679
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.546
when Luke Skywalker goes off-

680
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.389
George looked at Roger and said:'My God,

681
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:44.984
there's another generation,
isn't that wonderful.'


682
00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.619
Obviously, there was a huge age gap.

683
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:51.709
He was 72 and I
was 28 when I arrived here.

684
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:54.149
So our lives were very, very different.

685
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:55.549
There was a lot of banter:

686
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.189
He always used to refer to me,
when things weren't going well, as


687
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.829
'Smith of Bolton',

688
00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:01.829
And then,

689
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.509
obviously he referred to himself as
'Daniels of London'


690
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.263
and that sort of says it
all really, doesn't it?!


691
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.823
'George? I was wondering
if you could have look at this please?


692
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:30.029
I'm having a few
difficulties with the click'


693
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:34.029
The first nine months
were incredibly intense,


694
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.703
I mean, really just full on.

695
00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.904
At the time he was 72 I think,

696
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:43.229
but he was still putting in full days,

697
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:45.186
he expected me to
put in even longer hours.

698
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:49.549
He basically took me around the workshop,

699
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.549
showing me every single bit of equipment

700
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:55.989
and just teaching me how to use it
to the standard that he required.


701
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.069
The normal working day
didn't apply to George.


702
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.189
He got up at
6 o'clock in the morning,

703
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:02.589
went into his workshop,

704
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.749
and came out at 10
or 11 o'clock at night.

705
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.749
Few hours sleep, back in the workshop.

706
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.949
Roger worked for George
for five or so years,


707
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.464
in the workshop, sitting next door to him,

708
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:16.185
learning all the time.

709
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.389
And under the watchful eye of George.

710
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:23.709
Roger will tell you about
the time he had making dials


711
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:25.589
and how George used to
reject them, and say:


712
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.262
'Go away, that's not good'

713
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.546
yet to most people's
eyes they were perfect.


714
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.865
'So where do you want
the point of engagement?'


715
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:50.749
It was a great experience,

716
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:54.140
probably the finest
finishing school you could wish for


717
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:55.942
working with the great man himself.

718
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.549
Watchmaking is a trade,

719
00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.229
a craft, an art, profession,

720
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.229
it's all those things.

721
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.829
It's always passed from an individual,

722
00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.829
a Master Watchmaker, to apprentices.

723
00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:56.829
It's always been done that way.

724
00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.549
Two hundred years ago, apprentices didn't

725
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.902
just learn how to make watches
from Master watchmakers,


726
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.862
they would learn about finance,

727
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:08.149
how to manage their own workshop,

728
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:09.789
they would learn how to dress,

729
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.065
they would learn the
social mores of their time,


730
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:15.587
the Watchmaker might even
find his apprentice a wife.


731
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:18.549
Now, all that has disappeared

732
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:23.465
and the only thing we're
left with is pure education.


733
00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:30.423
The Master Watchmaker teaching the
apprentice how to go about making a watch.


734
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:33.470
And that's been replaced by watch schools.

735
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:41.460
But it existed in the relationship
between George and Roger Smith,


736
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:45.108
and it's very very important that it did.

737
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:56.149
This is George's bench
and really, in my view,


738
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:59.229
it's probably one of the
most iconic benches in the world.


739
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:04.099
I mean, every single watch that George made
was made at this bench.


740
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:05.869
This bench was down in London,

741
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.269
it moved over here
to the Isle of Man,

742
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:11.429
the Co-Axial Escapement
was built on this bench,


743
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:15.343
and many other of his incredible pieces.

744
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.224
All the hand tools all around the back,

745
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:21.429
plenty of files for all
the components and so on,


746
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:25.548
and of course his infamous
glasses and eyeglass.


747
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:32.549
What George wanted out of me
was to be able to make his watches


748
00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:35.949
to the standard he required.
So it was serious work.


749
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:37.906
I obviously wanted to,

750
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:40.909
you know, wanted to make
the very best I could


751
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:43.589
and if I could be accepted
by George, then really


752
00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:49.149
you know, I hoped that my future
would be a little bit easier.


753
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:51.459
For me, when I
was here in the workshop,

754
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.260
I kept fairly quiet and
just soaked everything up.


755
00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:57.549
I was like a big sponge really.

756
00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.589
And if I wasn't working,

757
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.184
we used to often go out
to the pub for lunch,


758
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:06.429
I'm afraid I just barraged him
with questions about his whole life.


759
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:09.029
I wanted to get as much
out of the whole experience


760
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.749
as he probably did from me.

761
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.310
So it was a good two-way relationship.

762
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.705
George proved it could be done,

763
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.349
he proved that, in this age,

764
00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:24.269
when we have all of these big brands
with all this money behind them,


765
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:27.740
you can still be an independent watchmaker.

766
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.948
Our entire lives are
structured around time.


767
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:41.389
We take it for granted,

768
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:45.542
Minute after minute, hour after hour,
year after year.


769
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.109
What type of man dedicates his life

770
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:54.227
to taking this human concept and
creating its physical reality?


771
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:57.707
And then elevating watchmaking beyond this,

772
00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.221
into an art form?

773
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:07.989
George was all about perfection

774
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:10.989
and the best quality,

775
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:13.550
and Roger's the same, you can
see it in Roger's work now.


776
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.865
He was always incredibly demanding.

777
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:21.543
He was always aware of the
fact that he was the best


778
00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.543
and he expected the
best from everyone else.


779
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:48.748
I'm afraid, there's always this
obsessive streak that I have


780
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:53.229
that just says: When I
finish the next watch,


781
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:55.229
that little component will be better.

782
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.349
Or, there's a little mark there,

783
00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.709
I don't think anybody else would notice it,

784
00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.189
but I notice it

785
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:04.789
and it's put in the memory bank.

786
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.462
So the next piece is...

787
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:09.747
you're always trying for perfection.

788
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:11.628
I don't think with this job

789
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:13.189
you're every totally happy!

790
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:16.467
There's something we have
to bear in mind about Roger,


791
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.269
He's 42 years old today

792
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:21.228
it's 2012, I think it's
42 or maybe 43 -

793
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.829
how old was George when he sat down
and made his first watch?


794
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.786
42.

795
00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:30.466
Now, Roger's been making
watches for 20 years.


796
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.629
What's going to happen
over the next 20 years?


797
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.586
What is Roger going to do?

798
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:47.349
So Roger's got a long way to go,

799
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:49.739
but I'm sure it's going
to be very interesting.


800
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:53.220
And it is not going to be
a slavish imitation of George,


801
00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:54.629
it hasn't been so far,

802
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:56.586
I'm sure it won't be in the future.

803
00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:00.268
I'm certainly similar
in some areas, but not all


804
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.624
I mean George was
quite an extraordinary man


805
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:06.219
Very big shoes to fill.

806
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:17.349
To do what these individuals do,

807
00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:19.989
whether it's Roger or George
or other independents,


808
00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.949
it requires a huge amount of dedication,

809
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:26.429
and perseverance,

810
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:28.429
and a certain personality,

811
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.429
because one is on one's own

812
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:31.949
for a large amount of time.

813
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:33.949
When I was learning about horology,

814
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:35.349
I used to stand behind George,

815
00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.864
and just watch, don't
enter into conversation.


816
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.505
Ask questions afterwards,

817
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:44.949
because you just see the
dedication of one man.


818
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:47.349
Roger works in the
workshop with other people,


819
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:49.349
most other watchmakers do,

820
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:51.789
but George has only ever
worked in the workshop


821
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:53.746
by himself, or with Roger.

822
00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:56.780
For me, the ultimate came when

823
00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.669
one day he took me out
for lunch to the pub,


824
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:05.029
and he asked if I would assist him in
making this Anniversary wristwatch,


825
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.749
and that, for me, was a turning point,

826
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:11.709
knowing that he could trust me
to make a watch for him.


827
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:14.463
And that's, yes, been wonderful.

828
00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:51.269
The last twenty odd years,
all I've thought about


829
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:55.029
is trying to create what we're now doing.

830
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.986
It's been a total obsession.

831
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:03.905
And it's been at the consequence
of everything else in my life really.


832
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:11.229
I don't think you're ever really satisfied
with what you've achieved.


833
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:14.222
You know, it's always a continual quest.

834
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.989
Now we're increasing
the size of my workshop


835
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:19.989
and taking on new watchmakers,

836
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:21.989
it's always the next challenge really.

837
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:25.949
And I think that's what makes it exciting.

838
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:34.429
As one gets older, one is very aware

839
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:37.829
that one has to live every day,

840
00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:40.503
and one of my mottos
in life is 'Carpe Diem'


841
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:41.739
'Seize the moment'.

842
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:44.949
I think it's very important
to seize the moment of time


843
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:48.181
and not let that time be wasted.

844
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.229
And I think - it sounds a bit cheesy!
But I think


845
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:57.018
'Time' is too precious
to be wasted on a cheap wristwatch.


846
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:03.469
You can go and buy for a
watch for a couple of quid,


847
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:07.748
but George's watches were
actually works of art,


848
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:12.149
to look at them, to gaze
into George's watches


849
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:14.789
is like gazing into his very soul.

850
00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:19.022
Every single part is George,
they are so beautiful.


851
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:24.103
A lot of things today in the society
we live in are very disposable,


852
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.229
you know, you buy it,
it stops working, you throw it away.


853
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:29.709
These watches are built in such a way

854
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.589
that hopefully they will last forever,

855
00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:34.349
even when Roger and George are long gone.

856
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:37.589
They can be serviced
by any good watchmaker,


857
00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:39.949
my children, or my children's children

858
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:44.262
can take them along, and so they'll
stand the passage of time.


859
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:46.070
That's important.

860
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.749
I don't think his life was smooth,

861
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:16.706
he actually drove himself.

862
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:19.589
There was stress in his life at times,

863
00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:22.909
but he got over it, he
was a very strong man,


864
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:26.789
don't forget that he probably
nearly died 4 or 5 times


865
00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:29.029
from every disease known to
man, but he got over them


866
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:31.549
because he had this courage
and this strength of purpose


867
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.744
to fight on with everything.

868
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:08.749
The Anniversary piece -
I started discussing it with George


869
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:10.749
about three years ago.

870
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:15.269
And the intention was that,
should he, should he die,


871
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:17.704
then we would carry on with that project.

872
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.181
Fortunately he saw the piece
several weeks before he passed away.


873
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:42.309
There is a time for everything

874
01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:46.589
and a season for every
activity under the heavens.


875
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:48.546
A Time to be born,

876
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.699
and a Time to die;

877
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:56.309
a Time to plant,
and a Time to uproot;

878
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:59.268
a Time to kill
and a Time to heal;

879
01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.219
a Time to tear down,
and a Time to build;

880
01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:08.269
a Time to weep,
and a Time to laugh;

881
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:12.548
a Time to mourn
and a Time to dance;

882
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:18.029
a Time to embrace
and a Time to refrain from embracing;


883
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.549
a Time to search,

884
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:22.506
and a Time to give up;

885
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:27.469
a Time to keep and
a Time to throw away;

886
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:30.940
a Time to be silent,
and a Time to speak;

887
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:35.149
a Time to love,

888
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.664
and a Time to hate;

889
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:40.783
a Time for war,

890
01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:44.309
and a Time for peace.

891
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:45.584
And a Time for peace.

892
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:52.709
One thing that George did - one of
the extraordinary things that he did,


893
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.709
was that he was
the first person in history

894
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:57.229
to have ever made a watch
from start to finish.


895
01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:00.028
You don't get that today in the industry.

896
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:02.909
Certainly, learning how to make
pocket watches by hand


897
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:05.219
using George's methods,
I've learnt that also.


898
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.349
If I can pass
that on to other people,

899
01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:12.829
through the apprentices
that we now have working with me,


900
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.309
that would be great.

901
01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.029
If, here on the
Isle of Man, we can

902
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:20.864
start a small community of watchmakers,

903
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:25.069
producing very small quantities of watches,

904
01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:27.029
but to an extra-ordinarily high level,

905
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:29.464
a level that you just can't
get in mass production.


906
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:34.749
If, by the time I die,
I can have achieved that,


907
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:35.870
then that would be great.

908
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:45.149
Every watchmaker knows
that he is perfecting


909
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:47.149
the measurement of his own mortality.

910
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:50.029
The turning hands on a
watch are symbols for


911
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:53.229
the revolutions that spin out man's span;

912
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:57.469
the hands turn, the sun
rises, apogees, sets,


913
01:02:57.470 --> 01:03:01.549
moons change, days renew.

914
01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:04.109
It is Man that ends.

915
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:07.147
But his works can endure.

916
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:15.989
Perhaps the nicest thing,
is that, in George's will,


917
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.989
he's left the total
contents of his workshop


918
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:21.749
a lifetime's collection of equipment,

919
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.105
everything in the
workshop is left to Roger.


920
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:27.425
And I spoke to George before his death,

921
01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:31.219
about his wishes, and he was absolutely
clear in his own mind


922
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:33.341
that Roger was the future.

923
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:37.509
'I was George's Apprentice'
he's the only one who can say that,


924
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:38.829
nobody else can ever say it.

925
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:43.985
Watch this space, you'll see him
rise to the levels of George.


926
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:07.389
I suppose, for George to have said,

927
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:09.789
'You're good enough to do that'...

928
01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:11.667
that's...

929
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:13.348
yes...

930
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:15.780
good, yes...
