00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:50.712
Oh..

5
00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:54.049
-Ray? Sweetie?

6
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:57.953
-Ah, I play it loud.

7
00:01:57.955 --> 00:01:59.788
Like, I can't hear him.

8
00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:03.912
- Pack your things, you're
going back to the hospital.


9
00:02:06.363 --> 00:02:09.731
I'm calling daddy
and he is taking you back.


10
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.133
-<i>No..</i>

11
00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:01.043
-Mom said you have to hurry.

12
00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:02.844
-Hey.

13
00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:04.980
- Is that the thing
for the bank?


14
00:04:04.982 --> 00:04:08.016
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's a commission.


15
00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:11.586
-Butterflies? So not metal.

16
00:04:11.588 --> 00:04:13.255
-I know, I know, I agree.

17
00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:16.158
But most people
don't like metal.


18
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:19.428
Most people's
taste is in their..

00:04:55.432 --> 00:04:58.633

40
00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:49.518
It's always been hot

41
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.655
but well, even Satan's praying
for it to rain.


42
00:05:58.228 --> 00:06:00.462
As y'all can see,
everything's true


43
00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.597
to the turn of
the century period.


44
00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.500

I'm not one for flowery words,
but tranquil comes to mind.


49
00:06:27.624 --> 00:06:29.958
- Zo, this is twice the size
of the room


50
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.526
that you have right now.

51
00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:37.799
Have fun, you're not gonna see
any of them


52
00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:40.168
with all the posters
that you have.


53
00:06:42.773 --> 00:06:46.141
- If there's even
one teddy left..


54
00:06:47.344 --> 00:06:49.478
You have to buy me some more.

55
00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:55.650
Okay?
- Yeah. Of course.


56
00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:18.373
<i>- Could make a mighty

57
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:20.575

for some space of her own.


59
00:07:23.447 --> 00:07:25.380
- This is gonna be
daddy's studio.


60
00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:29.017
- Or a studio.
Yes, indeed.


61
00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:30.886

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:39.561
-Um, sweetie.

65
00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:41.630
I had left my bag in the car

66
00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:44.966
and it's got some documents
I need.


67
00:07:44.968 --> 00:07:46.735
- If you want me to leave,
just ask.


68
00:07:46.737 --> 00:07:48.570
-Okay.

69
00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:57.445
-And now you can't sell it

70
00:07:57.447 --> 00:07:59.414
which is why the price
is so low.


71
00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:03.318

Folks love a bargain.

74
00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:11.459
After all, what are we talkin'
about here?


75
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:13.795
A sweet little old lady
who accidentally


76
00:08:13.797 --> 00:08:17.165
fell down the stairs,
and her dear old hubby


77
00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:19.568
<i>who couldn't stand
to live without her.</i>


78
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.938
<i>Sad, indeed..</i>

79
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.607
But it's not like
Charlie Manson lived here.


80
00:08:31.682 --> 00:08:33.602
- Can you give us a minute,
please?


81
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:36.151
<i>Thank you.</i>

82
00:08:43.727 --> 00:08:46.962
You don't find it creepy?
- What?


83
00:08:46.964 --> 00:08:48.630
The couple?
- Yeah.


84
00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:54.035
- No. No, I... I actually think
it's really romantic.


85
00:08:54.037 --> 00:08:56.371
He loved her so much he couldn't
live another day without her.


86
00:08:56.373 --> 00:08:58.306
-You just want this studio.

87
00:08:58.308 --> 00:09:02.143
- What? No. I'm not even
thinkin' about this.


88
00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:09.451
Can you hear that?
- What? What?

What is it?
- Buy me.

'Cause it's screaming at me

and keep quiet.


160
00:15:59.129 --> 00:16:01.896

come back.

163
00:16:08.038 --> 00:16:09.918
or worse,
place you under arrest.


164
00:16:11.508 --> 00:16:12.640
I'd much rather not.

167
00:16:49.345 --> 00:16:51.225
- It's never as bad
as you think.


168
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.417
Seriously, you just tough out
the first 30 minutes


169
00:16:56.419 --> 00:16:58.586
and then the rest is gravy.

170
00:16:58.588 --> 00:17:01.155
-I hate gravy.

171
00:17:03.993 --> 00:17:07.161
- Alright,
go forth brave soldier.


172
00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:20.708
Don't let your schooling get in the
way of your education, alright?


173
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.478
-Uh, yeah. I love you, dad.

174
00:17:36.326 --> 00:17:38.493
Hey, Zo.

175
00:20:52.822 --> 00:20:55.323
Oh, my God.

176
00:20:56.893 --> 00:20:59.093
Zooey.

177
00:20:59.095 --> 00:21:01.395
- I haven't gotten you
that good in ages.


178
00:21:01.397 --> 00:21:03.164
- Yeah, that was,
that was hysterical.


179
00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:04.699
That was super funny.
- Thank you.


180
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.004
-How was your first day?

181
00:21:12.775 --> 00:21:14.375
-Sucked big time.

182
00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:17.878
-Hey, hey.

183
00:21:19.615 --> 00:21:21.682
It'll get better, I promise.

184
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.053
Okay, it just takes time.

185
00:21:26.055 --> 00:21:28.956
Yeah, anything new,
it just takes time.

188
00:22:03.726 --> 00:22:05.292
Jesse!

189
00:22:07.196 --> 00:22:09.397
Wh... where were you?

190
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
-What?

191
00:22:13.002 --> 00:22:15.169

There's someone here
and it's not the pizza man.


195
00:22:50.373 --> 00:22:52.039
Hi.

196
00:23:06.389 --> 00:23:08.989
-I've got one just like that.

197
00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:11.192
-<i>A flying V.</i>

198
00:23:11.194 --> 00:23:13.894
You got a red Flying V?

199
00:23:13.896 --> 00:23:15.362
I want a Gibson Flying V

200
00:23:15.364 --> 00:23:17.331
like Kirk Hammett
from Metallica uses.


201
00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:19.867
He is my favorite guitar hero.

202
00:23:19.869 --> 00:23:21.302
I mean I asked mom and
dad to get one for my birthday


203
00:23:21.304 --> 00:23:23.471
but you know, Gibsons
are really expensive


204
00:23:23.473 --> 00:23:24.638
<i>so I'm getting
a little cheaper...</i>


205
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.373
-Excuse me.

206
00:23:28.945 --> 00:23:31.412
Can I help you?
- <i>Mmm.</i>


207
00:23:33.616 --> 00:23:36.016
I need to come home now.

208
00:23:37.854 --> 00:23:41.422
This is mommy and daddy's house.

209
00:23:41.424 --> 00:23:43.257
They're dead.

210
00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:46.427
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

211
00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:53.601
- I'm really sorry about what
happened with your parents.


212
00:23:53.603 --> 00:23:56.170
But yo... you don't live here
anymore.


213
00:23:56.172 --> 00:23:59.573
<i>Okay. It... it's time for you
to leave.</i>


214
00:23:59.575 --> 00:24:02.076
- They won't let me
play it loud.


215
00:24:02.078 --> 00:24:04.044
<i>I need to play it loud.</i>

216
00:24:04.046 --> 00:24:06.380
-You need to leave, now.

217
00:24:10.953 --> 00:24:12.920
<i>- Dad.
- Jess..</i>


218

Jesse.

219
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.531
- You need to leave
before I call the police.


220
00:24:26.736 --> 00:24:30.604
Alright, that's it,
I'm calling the police.


221
00:24:30.606 --> 00:24:33.040
I'm callin' 'em right now.

222
00:24:49.025 --> 00:24:50.090
-<i>You were mean.</i>

223

224
00:24:56.699 --> 00:24:58.599
<i>You didn't do that.</i>

225
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.973
-What?

226
00:25:05.975 --> 00:25:08.776
- Well, the poor guy, obviously
has something wrong with him


227
00:25:08.778 --> 00:25:11.512
and his parents did just die
in our house.


228
00:25:25.227 --> 00:25:26.961
-We've come to the place

229
00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:30.764
where we joke
about the idea of the devil.


230
00:25:30.766 --> 00:25:34.435
With the horns, and the tail,
and all that.


231
00:25:34.437 --> 00:25:37.671
<i>But that is Satan's lie</i>

232
00:25:37.673 --> 00:25:42.509
to distract us
from the reality of who He is.


233
00:25:42.511 --> 00:25:44.645
He is no mask
in a Halloween store.


234
00:25:46.882 --> 00:25:50.517
<i>He's not what you see
in the movies.</i>


235
00:25:52.154 --> 00:25:54.855
<i>He is an active, violent</i>

236
00:25:54.857 --> 00:25:57.625
<i>anti
-God personal reality.</i>

237
00:26:00.062 --> 00:26:05.165
And as much as we refuse to
admit it, He lives through us.


238
00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:08.002
He uses us to carry out

239
00:26:08.004 --> 00:26:11.071
His unspeakable deeds.

240
00:26:11.073 --> 00:26:15.209
<i>For we are His pawns,
we are His demons on Earth</i>


241
00:26:15.211 --> 00:26:19.046
<i>we satiate His hunger.</i>

242
00:26:19.048 --> 00:26:23.217
If you have the slightest bit
of greed, in your heart


243
00:26:23.219 --> 00:26:26.654
He will turn it into
an avalanche.


244
00:26:26.656 --> 00:26:29.523
He will slither into your soul.

245

-<i>That's really great Zooey</i>

246
00:27:06.929 --> 00:27:09.430

249

an outbreak on our hands.


250
00:27:18.307 --> 00:27:20.974
-Oh, my God. Dad.

251
00:27:20.976 --> 00:27:24.611
I said I wanted a flying V
and he's given me his.


252
00:27:24.613 --> 00:27:27.247
<i>And a Marshall, dad,

Dad.

254
00:27:32.888 --> 00:27:35.222
I can keep 'em right?

255
00:27:35.224 --> 00:27:38.959
Please. Please.

256
00:27:38.961 --> 00:27:40.160
-No.

257
00:27:40.162 --> 00:27:42.096
I can't let you
keep this guitar.


258

Hey. Hey.

259
00:27:49.939 --> 00:27:52.573
I'm gettin' you a guitar and an
amp for your birthday. Come on.


260
00:27:56.045 --> 00:27:58.612

Okay, totally deserve that.

I thought that I was in there
for five minutes.

00:33:51.133 --> 00:33:53.633
And I stepped outside
and the sun had gone down


294
00:33:53.635 --> 00:33:54.801
and I panicked.

295
00:33:56.705 --> 00:33:59.306
I didn't think that
I was in there for so long.


296

I just, I... I completely
got lost in it.


297

- Don't do it again.
- I won't.


298

-On my grave.

300
00:34:17.826 --> 00:34:19.025
-I swear.

Please?

Hello Austin, it's been a while,

00:36:06.435 --> 00:36:08.602
<i>There's always Satan.</i>

317
00:36:57.919 --> 00:36:59.886
- Did you tell her that
she could keep the guitar


318
00:36:59.888 --> 00:37:02.322
because, you know, I thought
that you said that you..


319
00:37:06.328 --> 00:37:07.661
Oh, my God.

320
00:37:09.731 --> 00:37:11.197
Is that..

321
00:37:16.071 --> 00:37:17.804
-I didn't mean to do this.

322
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:21.641
-Okay, what's going on?

323
00:37:25.514 --> 00:37:29.015
<i>This, this is our daughter
on fire.</i>


324
00:37:30.419 --> 00:37:32.185
-She can never see this.

325
00:37:32.187 --> 00:37:34.888
- Okay, well then destroy it.
- I can't.


326
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.356
-Why?

327
00:37:37.993 --> 00:37:40.527
- Because it isn't finished yet.

328
00:37:40.529 --> 00:37:42.562
- No, it is,
if you want it to be.


329
00:37:42.564 --> 00:37:45.398
- No. No, it's not
that simple, Astrid.


330
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.768
It's like these children
are inside of me.


331
00:37:50.038 --> 00:37:54.207
Begging, screaming
to be let out.


332
00:37:56.778 --> 00:37:58.345
And I don't know why.

333
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:49.562
-Come on.

334
00:42:42.397 --> 00:42:44.364
-He wanted it to be you.

335
00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:47.400
I wouldn't let Him.

336
00:42:48.403 --> 00:42:50.803
'Cause you're a special one.

337
00:43:00.015 --> 00:43:01.547
No. No... no... no.

338
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:03.316
You can't be loud.

339
00:43:03.318 --> 00:43:04.984
He'll make me do that thing
I don't wanna do


340
00:43:04.986 --> 00:43:06.653
and I don't wanna
do that to you.


341
00:43:06.655 --> 00:43:09.155
Please, please... please.

342
00:43:09.157 --> 00:43:10.990
Please, be quiet.

343
00:43:15.296 --> 00:43:18.564
If I take my hand away,
are you gonna be loud?


344
00:43:19.501 --> 00:43:21.267
No.
- Mm-mm.


345
00:43:21.269 --> 00:43:22.935
-Cross your heart?

346
00:43:22.937 --> 00:43:24.537
And hope to die?
- Mm-hmm.


347
00:43:24.539 --> 00:43:26.039
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.


348
00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:27.206
-Okay.

349
00:43:30.378 --> 00:43:33.746
Help!

350
00:43:40.221 --> 00:43:41.387
-Don't! Don't!

351
00:43:41.389 --> 00:43:45.058
Oh, no!

352
00:43:53.501 --> 00:43:55.435
-Get out!

353
00:43:55.437 --> 00:43:57.737
<i>Right now! Daddy!</i>

354
00:44:01.476 --> 00:44:03.109
Oh. Oh.

355
00:44:05.914 --> 00:44:07.914
Ah.

356
00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:47.453
-Were the doors locked?

357
00:44:49.424 --> 00:44:50.823
-Uh, yes, they were

358
00:44:50.825 --> 00:44:53.693
but, um, Jess went out
to the studio...


359
00:44:53.695 --> 00:44:55.261
-I'm so sorry.

360
00:44:56.364 --> 00:44:58.264
-<i>It's not your fault.</i>

361
00:45:00.702 --> 00:45:02.168
It's his fault.

362
00:45:04.139 --> 00:45:06.806
Now you mentioned that
he'd lived here before you all?


363
00:45:06.808 --> 00:45:07.874
-Mm-hmm.

364
00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.476
-Still the same locks?

365
00:45:11.146 --> 00:45:12.812
-Yeah.

366
00:45:12.814 --> 00:45:14.947
- Then there's every chance
that he has a key


367
00:45:14.949 --> 00:45:17.029
which means you need
to change them locks.


368
00:45:17.285 --> 00:45:18.451
-Okay.

369
00:45:20.421 --> 00:45:22.388
- And I think it's best
if you folks move into a motel.


370
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.124
Even, just for a few days.

371
00:45:25.126 --> 00:45:26.559
Give us some time
to run the prints


372
00:45:26.561 --> 00:45:28.601
and take a real good look
into this guy.


373
00:45:29.998 --> 00:45:32.465
I'll be stationed outside
all night.


374
00:45:32.467 --> 00:45:34.467
Until you're up
and out in the morning.


375
00:45:34.602 --> 00:45:35.701
So don't you worry.

376
00:45:36.738 --> 00:45:38.037
You're gonna be alright.

377
00:45:47.515 --> 00:45:49.081
-Try and get some sleep, okay.

378
00:45:49.083 --> 00:45:51.083
It's gonna make you feel
a lot better.


379
00:45:51.486 --> 00:45:52.985
-What if he comes back?

380
00:45:55.657 --> 00:45:57.990
- Well, that's why
the police lady is outside.


381
00:46:01.529 --> 00:46:03.196
-What if he gets past her?

382
00:47:02.323 --> 00:47:03.323
-Oh, my gosh.

383
00:47:04.592 --> 00:47:06.158
- Oh, my gosh.
- Astrid.


384
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.094
- I'm so sorry.
I thought that you were...


385
00:47:08.096 --> 00:47:09.829
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

386
00:47:12.267 --> 00:47:13.499
-I'm ready for school.

387
00:47:16.871 --> 00:47:18.971
-Sweetie...

388
00:47:18.973 --> 00:47:20.273
No, sw... sweetie, you don't,
you don't have to go


389
00:47:20.275 --> 00:47:21.607
to school today.

390
00:47:22.911 --> 00:47:24.477
-It's safer than here.

391
00:47:57.879 --> 00:47:59.845
- If he comes back,
I'll smash him.


392
00:48:03.751 --> 00:48:04.951
-I'm gonna be late.

393
00:48:06.554 --> 00:48:07.653
Bye.

394
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:38.918
-Oh. Oh, fuck.

395
00:48:43.291 --> 00:48:44.991
Hey.
- <i>Jesse.</i>


396
00:48:46.828 --> 00:48:48.468
- Yeah.
- <i>It's Mara.</i>


397
00:48:49.697 --> 00:48:52.531
I showed Leonard your painting.

398
00:48:52.533 --> 00:48:54.033
He approves.

399
00:48:57.472 --> 00:48:58.704
-That's uh, that's...

400
00:48:58.706 --> 00:49:01.007
<i>- He'd like to come by
your studio.</i>


401
00:49:01.009 --> 00:49:02.241
<i>See what you're working on.</i>

402
00:49:02.243 --> 00:49:04.076
-Yeah, yeah. No, definitely.

403
00:49:04.078 --> 00:49:06.379
That's great, any... any time.

404
00:49:06.381 --> 00:49:08.381
<i>- Leonard's got an opening
at three.</i>


405
00:49:10.351 --> 00:49:12.752
- Wait, today?
- <i>Yes.</i>


406
00:49:12.754 --> 00:49:14.387
-No, I... I can't.

407
00:49:14.389 --> 00:49:16.709
I... I have... I have
to pick my daughter up at three.


408
00:49:24.799 --> 00:49:26.198
-I can push it back to two.

409
00:49:27.535 --> 00:49:28.768
But that's all I can do.

410
00:49:30.405 --> 00:49:31.804
<i>Take it or leave it Jesse.</i>

411
00:49:41.082 --> 00:49:42.281
-Come on.

412
00:50:35.303 --> 00:50:37.937
- What this is, Jesse,
is a show of faith.


413
00:50:40.374 --> 00:50:42.608
<i>But I'm willing
to take that chance.</i>


414
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:46.112
Because your latest work is..

415
00:50:48.816 --> 00:50:49.976
Wonderfully disturbing.

416
00:50:53.154 --> 00:50:55.020
- Fuckin' painting
nearly killed me.


417
00:50:55.022 --> 00:50:57.490
-<i>Le sang de la terre.</i>

418
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:01.327
-I'm... I'm sorry.

419
00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:02.661
-The blood of the Earth.

420
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.068
The world's oldest
unblended cognac.


421
00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:10.703
That's what we've been sharing.

422
00:51:11.939 --> 00:51:13.572
<i>Beside the moment of course.</i>

423
00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:25.818
Now that you're being
represented by Belial.


424
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.654
<i>It's time for you to start
getting used to nice things.</i>


425
00:51:28.656 --> 00:51:30.055
-Uh, Leonard

426
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.593
I'd love to sit here
and drink this whole bottle


427
00:51:34.595 --> 00:51:36.495
with you right now,
really, I would


428
00:51:36.497 --> 00:51:38.697
but I gotta pick my daughter up.

429
00:51:38.699 --> 00:51:40.332
- I'm sure your daughter
won't mind


430
00:51:40.334 --> 00:51:42.234
if you're one
or two minutes late.


431
00:51:42.236 --> 00:51:44.403
-I'm already pushing it.

432
00:51:44.405 --> 00:51:46.705
- What's a few minutes
in the grander scheme?


433
00:51:47.942 --> 00:51:50.910
-Actually it's everything.

434
00:51:50.912 --> 00:51:53.712
I'm not gonna get into it
right now, just trust me.


435
00:51:53.714 --> 00:51:55.014
I can't be late.

436
00:51:58.052 --> 00:52:01.420
- Well, as they say,
"nothing of true worth


437
00:52:01.422 --> 00:52:03.222
"comes without some..

438
00:52:05.793 --> 00:52:06.793
Sacrifice."

439
00:52:13.167 --> 00:52:15.601
To sacrifice.

440
00:52:57.712 --> 00:52:59.144
-Oh, no.

441
00:53:12.393 --> 00:53:15.194
<i>Come on!</i>

442
00:53:27.942 --> 00:53:29.308
Come on.

443
00:54:00.941 --> 00:54:02.241
Zooey!

444
00:55:46.947 --> 00:55:47.947
-<i>He's right.</i>

445
00:55:50.384 --> 00:55:52.451
You are the sweetest candy
of them all.


446
00:55:54.054 --> 00:55:57.289
I have to do that thing
I don't wanna do now.


447
00:55:58.793 --> 00:56:00.359
-Please.

448
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:01.860
Please.

449
00:56:01.862 --> 00:56:05.464
<i>Let me go, please!</i>

450
00:56:05.466 --> 00:56:06.932
<i>Please!</i>

451
00:59:21.662 --> 00:59:27.065
You swore on my grave.

452
00:59:43.617 --> 00:59:47.819
- Look, um, I know it doesn't
seem like it right now


453
00:59:47.821 --> 00:59:50.889
<i>but...
she's actually very lucky.</i>


454
00:59:53.761 --> 00:59:55.360
When he was twelve,
he did the same thing


455
00:59:55.362 --> 00:59:57.929
to a nine-year-old girl.

456
00:59:57.931 --> 00:59:59.431
<i>Hit her over the head
with a rock</i>


457
00:59:59.433 --> 01:00:00.713
<i>and then he tried to bury her.</i>

458
01:00:02.136 --> 01:00:03.902
Case went to juvenile court
and he ended up


459
01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:06.271
in state psychiatric
for 20 years.


460
01:00:10.277 --> 01:00:13.679
- Does it say in there
why he did it?


461
01:00:21.855 --> 01:00:23.955
"I have to feed Him children.

462
01:00:25.325 --> 01:00:27.459
<i>Because children
are His candy."</i>


463
01:00:29.463 --> 01:00:32.364
<i>He goes on to clarify
who "He" is</i>


464
01:00:34.134 --> 01:00:36.101
<i>none other than Satan himself.</i>

465
01:00:46.246 --> 01:00:47.366
Thanks for your patience.

466
01:00:48.682 --> 01:00:49.682
How's she doin'?

467
01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:54.720
Like I was tellin' Jesse here.

468
01:00:54.722 --> 01:00:56.455
<i>I think
the best course of action</i>


469
01:00:56.457 --> 01:00:59.491
<i>is to put you into
witness protection.</i>


470
01:01:01.428 --> 01:01:03.462
<i>- And how long does
witness protection last?</i>


471
01:01:03.464 --> 01:01:05.464
<i>- As long as it takes
to find him.</i>


472
01:01:15.843 --> 01:01:17.142
-Just the gas?

473
01:01:34.194 --> 01:01:35.360
-Need a hand with that?

474
01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:36.695
-Nope. I got it.

475
01:01:36.697 --> 01:01:38.257
- You sure?

-Uh-huh.

480
01:01:53.814 --> 01:01:55.147
I really feel bad
