12
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.020
我应该可以给你做个口味接近的
I'm sure I can make you something close to it.

你知道它用的是哪种茶叶吗

14
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.440
哦 不是 不是那种茶
Oh, no. No, no. It's not this kind of tea.


15
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.350
我是想买那种茶粉
I'm looking for your crystallized teas.


16
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.650
不好意思 我没有茶粉
Ah. Sorry, I... I don't carry tea crystals.


17
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.610
你一个开茶店的怎么能没有茶粉呢
How can you be a tea shop and not carry tea crystals?


18
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.280
我好失望
How frustrating.


19
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.070
我给你配一种口味接近的吧
Why don't you let me make you something that might be close?


20
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.040

24
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.680
他总是很晚回来
He's always late.


25
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.020
我有时候也会很晚回家
Well, I'm late sometimes, too.


26
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.860
你知道 我接下去几周会很忙

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.150
美香
Mika.


30
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.450
美香 别对他太苛刻
Mika? Don't be too hard on him.


31
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.950
他跟我说 快关门的时候
He told me there was a rush of customers


32
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.500
来了一拨客人
towards the end of the day.


33
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.210
这对他来说是好事 他需要生意
That's good news for Daddy. He needed that.


34
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.180
<i>我觉得饭很好吃
I loved that meal.</i>


35
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.230
你喜欢那个辣椒酱吗
Did you like the gochujang sauce?


36
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.190
- 我喜欢  - 是我做的
- I did. - I made it.


37
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.270
你说过了
You mentioned that.


38
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.860
这是她第一次做
It was her first time.


39
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.610
所以是你把材料放到碗里
So you put the ingredients in the bowl


40
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.990
然后是你搅拌的
and you mixed them all together?


41
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.660
对
Yeah.


42
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.740
好吃吧
It's good, huh?


43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.830
真的很好吃 妹妹
It was really wonderful, <i>mei mei.</i>


44
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.240
谢谢
Thank you.


45
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.870
下次我要给胡萝卜去丝

46
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.290
是切丝
Julienne.


47
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.000
不过我不会让你切的
And no, you're not.


48
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.350
美香长大得好快
Mika's growing up so fast.


49
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.360
她一直问我们为什么总是这么忙
She keeps asking why we're always busy.


50
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.360
她理解的
She understands.


51
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.990
- 而且杨…  - 不 她不理解
- And Yang is... - No, she doesn't.


52
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.450
我感觉…
I feel like...


53
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.910
我不知道 我…
I don't know. I...


54
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.460
我不想有遗憾
I don't want to regret.


55
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.800
我会多抽出点时间来的
Um... Um, I'll make more time.


56
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.050
我会的 我保证
I will. I promise.


57
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.640
你知道我不会把这个负担强加给你的吧
You know I'm not putting this on you, right?


58
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.470
应该会吧
Hmm. Sort of.


59
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.520
- 我不会的  - 我开玩笑的
- I'm not. - I'm teasing.


60
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.900
我只是想让我们成为一个团队
I just want us to be a team.


61
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.690
成为一个家

这已经是我们的最好成绩了

- <i>Yang!</i> - <i>Yang?</i>

杨 之 后

114
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.310
我们应该还有三年的保修期
It looks like we have three years left


115
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.020
但他们不接我电话 所以…
on the warranty, but they're not answering, so...


116
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.020
- 你不能直接过去吗  - 可以 我准备去了
- Can't you just go there? - Yeah, I'm going to,


117
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.560
但我都不知道那个店还在不在
but I don't know if the store is even there anymore.


118
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.610
我查了一下 已经查不到了
I did a search. I can't find them anywhere.


119
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.860
你给"兄弟&姐妹"打电话了吗
Did you call Brothers & Sisters?


120
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.360
我们不是直接从那里买的
We didn't buy from them directly, so...


121
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.740
所以他们不能提供保修?
They won't honor the warranty?


122
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.950
不行 保修要找"第二个孩子"
No, the warranty is with Second Siblings.


123
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.040
我就说我们应该买个新的
I told you we should've just bought a new one.


124
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.250
他是新的 算是吧
He was new. I mean, practically.


125
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.580
他是翻新的

And he'd only been in use for five days. Five days.


128
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.880
- 我们就省了…  - 但现在 他…
- And we saved... - But now he...


129

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.820

He... He shut down last night. Won't restart.


138
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.910
- 这种情况之前发生过吗  - 没有
- Has this happened before? - No.


139
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.540
你认识维修工吗
You got a technician?


140
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.960
他还在保修期内

141
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.090
我是不会把他送回"兄弟&姐妹"的
I wouldn't take him back to Brothers & Sisters.


142
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.880
他们只会让你把他回收

143
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.960
然后换个新的给你 你知道为什么的
for a new model. You know why.


144
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.510
我没准备把他送那儿去
I'm not taking him there.


145
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.090
保修是在另一家店
The warranty's with another store.


146
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.180
你不是直接买的官方的吗
You didn't buy him direct?


147
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.180
不是 那个…他有官方认证的
No. No, uh, he's certified.


148
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.060
我要去叫下美香
I have to go and get Mika.


149
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.730
美香还在这儿吗
Oh, Mika's still here?


150
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.890
她看到杨宕机的样子了吗
Did she see Yang all dead-eyed?


151
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.610
- 她会吓到的吧  - 嗯
- I bet it freaked her out. - Yeah.


152
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.270
听我说 我认识伍德伯里的一个维修工
Listen, I got a technician in Woodbury.


153
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.610
大老远过去也值
It's worth the trek.


154
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.150
我把他的信息发给你
I'm going to send you his info.


155
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.530
不用了 我就带他去"快修"吧
No, I'll just... I'll take him to Quick Fix


156
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.700
要是我搞不定的话
if I can't figure it out.


157
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.740
傻子才去那里 别送他去那
That place is for morons. Don't take him there.


158
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.700
我认识的那个人修一下只要三分之一的价钱
My guy will fix him for a third of the cost.


159
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.200
你跟拉斯说是我让你去的
You tell Russ I sent ya.


160
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.210
好吧 我该走了 谢谢
Okay. Okay, got to go. Thank you.


161
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.670
美香 美香

162
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.050
走吧 孩子 我们得走了
Come on, kiddo, we gotta boogie.


163
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.550
我不想去上学 我想和杨待在一起
I don't want to go to school. I want to be with Yang.


164
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.680
美香 我们拖得越久
Mika, the longer we wait,


165
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.140
杨的情况就越糟糕
the worse it's gonna be for Yang.


166
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.260
什么意思
What do you mean?


167
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.640
他会开始分解
He'll start decomposing.


168
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.060
什么
What?


169
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.680
来吧 我们该走了
Come on, we gotta go.


170
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.020
美香 快
Mika, now.


171
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.780
<i>对了 美香今天都跟我一起
FYI, Mika's going to be with me for the day.</i>


172
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.990
<i>为什么 怎么了
Why? What happened?</i>


173
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.570
因为她刚刚拒绝去上学
Well, you know, she just refused and


174
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.490
我就不拽她去学校了
I wasn't gonna drag her inside.


175
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.700
<i>美香
Mika?</i>


176
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.660
<i>说话
Answer me.</i>


177
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.500
妈妈 我不能去 我要和杨待在一起
Mom, I can't. I want to be with Yang.


178
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.590
<i>没关系 亲爱的
It's okay, darling.</i>


179
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.670
<i>我只是想听听你的声音
I just wanted to hear your voice.</i>


180
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.300
<i>你要听爸爸的话 乖乖的好吗
You need to listen to Dad and be good and calm, okay?</i>


181
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.970
杨会好起来吗
Is Yang going to be better?


182
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.050
嗯 他会…
Yes, he's gonna be...


183
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.640
<i>其实我们也不确定 但…
Well, we don't know for sure, but...</i>


184
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720
这是什么意思
What do you mean?


185
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.890
是啊 你这是什么意思
Yeah, what do you mean?


186
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.520
<i>我们没法承诺 但是美香 听着
We can't make any promises, but, Mika, listen,</i>


187
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.310
<i>如果你今天都乖乖地听话
if you can be good and calm for the rest of the day,</i>


188
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.070
<i>我会给你一个惊喜
I'm gonna bring you a surprise.</i>


189
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.530
什么惊喜
What?


190
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.570
你刚刚就承诺了要给她一个惊喜
You just promised her a surprise.


191
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.240
- 是什么呀 妈妈  - 那不一样
- What is it, Mom? - <i>That's different.</i>


192
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.400
妈妈 是什么呀
Mom, what is it?


193
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.860
<i>我不是想要…
I wasn't trying to...</i>


194
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.950
<i>谢谢你今天休息一天
I appreciate you taking the day off.</i>


195
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.540
- 妈妈?  - 亲爱的
- Mom? - <i>Honey,</i>


196
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.000
<i>要乖 听爸爸的话

197
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.120
<i>我得挂了

198
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.120
<i>我要准备我的报告了 回聊
I have to get ready for my presentation. We'll talk.</i>


199
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.420
她要送我什么呀 爸爸
What is she gonna get me, Dad?


200
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.010
我不知道
I have no idea.


201
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.420
我觉得我知道
I think I know.


202
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.390
不要对具体的东西抱有希望
Just don't get your hopes up for anything specific.


203
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.310
哥哥  我知道她要给我什么东西
<i>Gege,</i> I know what she's gonna get me.


204
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.060
你好?
Excuse me?


205
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.690
- 你好?  - 有什么事吗
- Excuse me? - Can I help you?


206
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.320
嗯 我想问你能不能…
Yeah, I was wondering if you could...


207
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.780
我买了…
I purchased a...


208
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.240
这里之前是可以给收养的中国小孩
This used to be a store where you could buy, uh,


209
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.660
买一个哥哥或姐姐的店
an older sibling for Chinese adoptions.


210
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.160
名字叫"第二个孩子"
It was called Second Siblings.


211
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.290
我们这是卖鱼和鱼缸的
We sell fish and tanks.


212
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.380
嗯 我看出来了
Yeah, I can see,


213
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.920
那你知道之前那家店怎么了吗
but do you know what happened to that shop?


214
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.630
在我之前的那家店是卖内存的
Before my store, they sold memory.


215
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.550
纪念本 是这么说的吗
Memory-balia. Is that how you say it, memory-balia?


216
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.600
- 纪念品  - 纪念品 对
- Memorabilia. - Memorabilia. Yeah, memories.


217
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.350
不卖机器人吗
But no technos?


218
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.060
不卖 我不知道他那家店之前是卖什么的
No, I'm not sure what it was before that.


219
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.150
好吧 谢谢
All right, thank you.


220
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.530
美香?
Mika?


221
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.320
美香 来 我们走了
Mika. Mika, come on, let's go.


222
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.540
我想要一条鱼
I want a fish.


223
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.670
哥哥 这是泡泡
<i>Gege?</i> Meet Puffy.


224
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.380
所以这是黑匣子出了问题
Uh, it's a black box issue, okay?


225
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.880
但根据规定 我们是不可以
Uh, so by law, we're not allowed


226
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.600
改动内部机核的 不好意思
to tamper with the, uh, core interior, unfortunately.


227
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.850
那你们能干嘛
So what is it that you do here?


228
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.890
我们由"兄弟&姐妹"官方认证
We are certified with Brothers & Sisters, Incorporated,


229
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.810
可以修理或更换最常使用的
to repair or replace up to 12 parts


230
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.350
十二个部件
most commonly in need of service.


231
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.940
你可以看一下那边的
If you want to take a gander there


232
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.360
十二点诊断图
at the 12-point diagnostic.


233
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.070
但你这个诊断只是…
Yeah, but your diagnostics is just...


234
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.070
我们把杨送去给认证的分析师进行了分析
Um, well, we hooked up Yang to our certified analyzer,


235
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.490
十二个部件都正常
and, uh, all 12 parts were in working order,


236
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.830
但从读数上能看出
however, the readout did indicate that there was


237
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.500
他存在机核故障 所以…
a core malfunction, unfortunately, so...


238
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.910
所以什么 你们无能为力?
So what? So there's nothing you can do?


239
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.620
不是 我们还是可以提供一些服务的
Oh, there's a couple things we can do here.


240
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.540
我们可以把他回收给"兄弟&姐妹"
Um, we can have him recycled at Brothers & Sisters.


241
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.630
如果在他开始分解前回收的话
Uh, if you do so before he begins to decompose,


242
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.550
你会得到一张1000美元的新机优惠券
you'll get $1,000 off on a new model, which is great.


243
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.930
如果你不想回收他
Uh, if you don't want to have him recycled,


244
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.220
我也理解 我们也可以
which I completely understand, um, we are equipped


245
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.560
把他的头部和喉咙更换成虚拟助手
to turn his head and his voice box into a virtual assistant,


246
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.810
并为您整修剩下的部分
and we'd salvage the remaining parts for ya.


247
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.100
什么
What?


248
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.650
但我们要把机核送到…
But we would have to send the core to, uh,


249
00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.770
"兄弟&姐妹"
Brothers & Sisters.


250
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.150
不不不 这是不可能的
No, no, no. That's not gonna happen.


251
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.860
把他还给我 我再去别的地方问问
Now, just give him back to me, and I'll get a second opinion.


252
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.940
好的 没问题
Oh, sure. Of course.


253
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.360
那诊断费一共是250美元 谢谢
Uh, so that'll be 250 for the diagnostics, please.


254
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.660
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding me.


255
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.490
不好意思 没开玩笑
Unfortunately, no.


256
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.480
<i>听起来不太妙
That doesn't sound good.</i>


257
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.560
我知道
I know.


258
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.770
<i>你跟美香是怎么说的
What did you tell Mika?</i>


259
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.110
我说我们要去别家问问
I said we were getting a second opinion.


260
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.030
这事比我预期的要麻烦
It's already taken longer than I expected.


261
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.240
- 爸爸  - 你好 美香
- Daddy? - <i>Hi, Mika.</i>


262
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.450
你好
Hi.


263
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.740
<i>你还好吗
Are you okay?</i>


264
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.290
不太好 我有了一条小鱼
No. I got a fish.


265
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.790
<i>是吗
You did?</i>


266
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.170
- 是吗  - 嗯
- <i>She did?</i> - Yeah.


267
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.920
是一条小…我过会儿跟你解释
Yeah, it's a little... I'll explain later.


268
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.090
我们快到了
We're almost there.


269
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.760
<i>好吧 保持联系
All right. Keep me posted.</i>


270
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.930
好的
Okay.


271
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.180
<i>再见 美香
Bye, Mika.</i>


272
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.890
再见 和杨说再见
Bye. Say bye to Yang.


273
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.810
<i>再见 杨
Bye, Yang.</i>


274
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.490
这是内部机核故障
It is an interior core problem.


275
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.110
是的 我们已经知道了
Yeah, we knew that already.


276
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.410
我需要你的允许才能打开机核
I need your permission to break open the core.


277
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.080
这是违法的
It's against the law.


278
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.460
这就是…公司吓唬人罢了
It's just... It's a bunch of corporate bullshit.


279
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.170
你知道规矩是谁定的吗
Do you know who made that a law?


280
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.130
"兄弟&姐妹"公司
Brothers & Sisters.


281
00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.220
他们只是想保护自己的间谍装置
They're just trying to protect their spyware.


282
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.430
你把他送去回收了
You recycle that,


283
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.930
他们就会得到你家庭的大量数据
they will have so much data on your family,


284
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.480
可有你头疼的了
it'll make your head spin.


285
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.480
我不感兴趣
I'm not interested.


286
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900
那是你的损失
Your loss.


287
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.230
你保证会修好他的
You promised to fix him.


288
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.530
美香 我让你在外面等
Mika, I said wait outside.


289
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.320
你说他会没事的
You said he was gonna be fine.


290
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.870
快点 你得做个决定
Come on, man. You gotta make a decision.


291
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.090
<i>或许这是一件好事
Maybe this is a good thing.</i>


292
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.640
<i>这怎么会是件好事呢
How is this a good thing?</i>


293
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.300
杨…
Yang has been...


294
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.680
杨真的太好了
Yang has been wonderful.


295
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.480
我们会非常想念他的
And we'd all miss him terribly,


296
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.230
但我们过分依赖他了
but we've been over-reliant on him.


297
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.530
我们买杨是为了让美香
We bought Yang to connect Mika


298
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.110
更亲近她的中国血统 而不是抚养她长大
to her Chinese heritage, not to raise her.


299
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.820
是 但我们在杨身上花了很多钱
Yeah, but we spent a lot of money on Yang.


300
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.120
我不会…
I mean, I'm not gonna...


301
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.200
因为他不止是教美香中国小知识
...you know, feel bad if he does more for Mika


302
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.620
而感到对不起他
than teach her Chinese fun facts.


303
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.170
他做的不止这些 但这不是重点
He does a lot more than that, but you're missing the point.


304
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.420
重点是什么
What's the point?


305
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.170
如果我们没法把杨修好
If we can't fix Yang,


306
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.300
我们也不会再买一个给美香了
we're not gonna buy another sibling for Mika.


307
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.800
那样实在是太…
That would just be...


308
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.180
奇怪了
strange.


309
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.640
况且我们也买不起
And we can't afford it anyway.


310
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.440
所以我们要多参与进来
So we need to be more involved.


311
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.860
比现在参与得更多
More than we are now.


312
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.190
而且不止是抚养她长大
And not just in raising her,


313
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.610
还有让她亲近她的文化和传统
in connecting Mika to her culture and heritage.


314
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.070
那就是我们的责任了
Like, that will be on us.


315
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.870
所以我们要有这个准备和意愿
So we need to be ready and willing.


316
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.890
(春分)

317
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.110
妹妹 你怎么了
Mei mei,<i>what's wrong?</i>


318
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.450
<i>没事
Nothing.</i>


319
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.580
你看起来不像是没事
Your face says something different.


320
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.040
有几个小孩
Just some kids.


321
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.710
你班上的吗
In your class?


322
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.710
不是 休息的时候
No, kids at recess.


323
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.380
他们问我父母的事
They were asking about my real parents.


324
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.760
这样啊
I see.


325
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.470
那你怎么说的
And what did you say?


326
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.390
我跟他们说了我的妈妈和爸爸
I told them about Mom and Dad,


327
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.980
然后他们说 "他们不是你的亲生父母"
and they said, "No, your real parents."


328
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.070
他们说爸爸妈妈不是我真正的父母
They said Mom and Dad weren't really my parents. Not really.


329
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.490
你相信吗
Do you believe them?


330
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.870
我是说 他们是我们父母 但…
I mean, they're our parents, but...


331
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.710
我们不是
we're not,


332
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.840
你知道的 他们不是…
you know, they're not...


333
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.380
不是真正的
Not really.


334
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.430
妹妹
Mei mei.


335
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.430
就是这里
Here it is.


336
00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.020
你看这里
Take a look at this.


337
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.520
这棵树受伤了吗
Is the tree hurt?


338
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:17.780
没有 这里将有奇迹发生
No. Something wonderful is happening here.


339
00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860
什么奇迹
What?


340
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.780
你看 这根树枝来自另一棵树
You see, this branch is from a different tree.


341
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.080
是吗
It is?


342
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.160
是的 而现在 它就要成为这棵树的一部分了
Yes, but now it's becoming an actual part of this tree.


343
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.250
没有吧 只是假装而已
Not really, though. It's just pretend.


344
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.340
你为什么这么说
Why do you say that?


345
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.010
因为它只是被绑在这棵树上了
Because it's just taped to the tree.


346
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:43.180
哦 对 现在看起来是这样 对吗
Oh, right. It looks like that, doesn't it?


347
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.770
来 我们找一棵已经连上的
Here, let's find one that's already attached.


348
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.160
<i>妹妹
Mei mei.</i>


349
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.620
看到这根树枝了吗
See this branch?


350
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.500
这根树枝同样来自另一棵树
This branch is also from another tree.


351
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.710
但你看 你就像这根树枝一样
But look, you're connected to Mom and Dad,


352
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.210
和爸爸妈妈连在了一起
just like this branch.


353
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.010
你是这棵家庭树的一部分 真的
You're a part of the family tree. For real.


354
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.760
那你也是
Then so are you.


355
00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.260
他们为什么要这么做
Why do they do it?


356
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.180
为什么要把树枝移到另一棵树上
Why do they move branches to different trees?


357
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.600
这叫嫁接
It's called grafting.


358
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.520
这样做可以创造新的东西
They do it to make something new.


359
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.690
有些你喜欢吃的苹果
Some of the apples you love


360
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.860
就是通过嫁接不同品种的树产生的
were produced by combining different trees.


361
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.070
这是一项古老的技术
It's an ancient technique


362
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.950
早在4000多年前就在中国使用了
that was used in China over 4,000 years ago.


363
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.660
- 一个中国小知识  - 对
- A Chinese fun fact. - Yes.


364
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.660
但你要知道 嫁接的两棵树都很重要
But you should know that both trees are important.


365
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.040
不只是这棵 这根树枝来自的那棵树也很重要
Not just this one, but the one from this branch, too.


366
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.920
你另一个家庭对你来说也很重要
Your other family tree is also a vital part of who you are.


367
00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.250
你明白吗
Do you understand?


368
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.980
我想和爸爸一起去
I want to go with Dad.


369
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.940
不行 你今天要去上学
No, kiddo, you need to go to school today.


370
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.020
但是杨! 我要见杨!
But Yang! I wanna see Yang!


371
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.730
你的泡泡呢
Hey, what about your Pup-Pup?


372
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.400
你不想拿给你朋友看吗
Don't you want to show your friends?


373
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.490
杨
Yang.


374
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.030
杨很快就会回家了
Yang's gonna be home soon.


375
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.740
他好点了吗
Is he better?


376
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.490
到时候就知道了
We'll see.


377
00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.950
但你今天要去上学
But you need to go to school.


378
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.200
杨会希望你去上学的 为了哥哥去学校吧
Yang would want that. Do it for <i>gege.</i>


379
00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.290
他会希望我带泡泡给他们看
He'd want me to show my Pup-Pup.


380
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.290
好了 我出门了
All right, I'm heading out.


381
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.000
好 记得告诉我进展
Okay. Let me know how it goes.


382
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.090
嗯
Will do.


383
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.840
你的包 来吧
Your bag. Come on.


384
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.370
<i>我们一直都知道 有些机器人
We've always known that some bots</i>


385
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.410
<i>安装了间谍装置
are equipped with spyware.</i>


386
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.500
特别是外国的 现在我们有证据了
Especially the foreign ones. And now we have proof.


387
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.920
现在? 所以你之前从来没见过这东西
Now? So you've never seen these before.


388
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.710
有什么关系呢 东西就这东西
What does it matter? It is what it is.


389
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.420
你看过录像了吗
Have you looked at the recordings?


390
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.510
没有
No.


391
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.220
没看过 我可是支持隐私权的
No! I'm pro-privacy.


392
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.560
我可以看看里面有什么吗
Can I see what's on here?


393
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.270
你需要一个特殊的读卡器
You'll need a special reader.


394
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.890
这种接口我从来没见过
The connectors, they're nothing I've seen before.


395
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.110
这可是很高端的东西
This is some high-level shit, man.


396
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.360
这真的是…
I mean, this is...


397
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.740
不好意思 我只是想理清头绪
Sorry, I'm... I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.


398
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.700
- 好烦  - 确实
- It's disturbing. - Yes.


399
00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.830
确实让人心烦
It is disturbing.


400
00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.420
该醒过来了 哥们
It's time to wake up, man.


401
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.980
那我去哪买这种读卡器
So how do I buy a reader that I can see what's on this?


402
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.480
这种读卡器没的卖的
No one's selling a reader for that.


403
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:06.770
你得找人专门
You'll have to have one


404
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.280
改装一个适配这种接口的
specifically modified for those connectors.


405
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.280
行吧
Great.


406
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.080
好吧 我告诉你一个人
Okay, I'm gonna give you a name.


407
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.710
没有电话 但这是地址
There's no number, but this is where you find them.


408
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.770
我要给你多少钱
How much do I owe you?


409
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.440
我说了 我收钱修东西而已
Like I said, I get paid to fix things.


410
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.030
谢谢
Thank you.


411
00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.530
那我把杨带回去了
I guess I'll take Yang back.


412
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.660
我跟你说
I'll tell you what.


413
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.670
你为什么不先看了再说
Why don't... Why don't you look what's on there first?


414
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.420
如果里面的东西不太好
If it's something bad, disturbing,


415
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.260
你可能都不想再让这个机器人进家门了
you might not want this bot in your house anymore.


416
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.390
你可以带走他 但他会开始分解
You can take him, but also, he's gonna start decomposing.


417
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.690
分解剩下的也不值几个钱
You won't get as much value for him.


418
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.860
我可以把他接在模拟器上
I can keep him hooked up on the simulator


419
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.700
等你多了解一些情况
until you know more.


420
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.200
你是乔治的朋友 对吧
You're a friend of George, right?


421
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.370
对
Yeah.


422
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.750
<i>抱歉 她在开会
Sorry, she's in a meeting,</i>


423
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.880
<i>但我可以为您留言
but I'd be happy to pass on a message.</i>


424
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.380
好 麻烦告诉她…
Yeah, could you just tell her...


425
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.170
<i>喂? 还在吗
Uh, hello? Are you still there?</i>


426
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.340
算了 没事 我一会儿再打给她
You know what, it's all right. I'll talk to her later.


427
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.050
<i>好的 需要她一会儿给您回电吗
Great. Should I have her call you back?</i>


428
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.970
不用 没事 谢谢
No. No, it's all right. Thank you.


429
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.820
有人说我可以找你
I was told I could talk to you.


430
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.950
我找麦克斯·沃克 但他们说…
I was looking for Max Walker, but they mentioned...


431
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.280
我不感兴趣
Oh, I'm not interested.


432
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.370
什么
Sorry?


433
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.000
你是来谈什么阴谋论的吗
Are you here to talk some conspiracy shit?


434
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.620
不是 拉斯说我可以…
No. No, Russ told me that I could...


435
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.080
拉斯? 好吧 你是他们的人
Russ? Oh, man, you're one of them.


436
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.920
真不敢相信他们会让你进来
I can't believe they let you back here.


437
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.670
我不是他们的人 我…
I'm not one of them. I...


438
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.670
我有这个东西
I have this.


439
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.010
他说麦克斯可以帮上忙
I was told Max might be able to help me with it.


440
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.510
那是什么
What is that?


441
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.930
拉斯说这是间谍装置
Russ said it's spyware.


442
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.560
这是从哪儿来的
Where did you find it?


443
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.020
在杨体内发现的
It was inside Yang.


444
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.900
他是我们的…
And... he's our...


445
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.450
我们收养了女儿之后买的他 她是中国人
We bought him after we adopted our daughter. She's Chinese.


446
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.570
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.


447
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.870
杨宕机之后
And my neighbor recommended Russ


448
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.620
我邻居给我推荐的拉斯 拉斯打开了…
after Yang shut down, and Russ broke in...


449
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.790
我…抱歉 能不能让我…
Can I... Sorry. Can I?


450
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:08.460
当然
Yeah, sure.


451
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.060
我的天呐 这可不是什么间谍装置
Holy shit, this isn't spyware.


452
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.060
我敢肯定这是内存条
I'm pretty sure it's a memory bank.


453
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.030
<i>内存条可以让机器人
The memory banks allowed the technos</i>


454
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.610
<i>每天记录几秒的时间
to record a few seconds each day.</i>


455
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.740
<i>实验室之前一直在研究
The labs were trying to understand</i>


456
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.780
<i>机器人如何判断是否值得记忆
what technos considered memorable.</i>


457
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.910
<i>但研究没有成果
But the research was uncovered,</i>


458
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.080
<i>整个项目因为侵犯隐私法
the whole project was shut down</i>


459
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.160
<i>而立即被关停了
immediately for violating privacy laws.</i>


460
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.580
<i>那我该怎么做
So what do I do?</i>


461
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.000
我不骗你 这…
Oh, I'm not gonna lie. This...


462
00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.760
这东西非常重要
This is a big deal.


463
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.340
如果这是控制器的话 拉斯就说对了
If it's the regulator, then Russ is right.


464
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.300
他没法再启动了
He's not gonna turn on.


465
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.810
我跟你说实话
I'm just being honest with you.


466
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.060
但他的存在
But his existence,


467
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.560
杨的存在
Yang's existence would be


468
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.400
对我们博物馆
an invaluable contribution to this museum


469
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.110
以及对理解机器人智慧
and just to the whole understanding


470
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.650
会有巨大的贡献
of techno-sapiens.


471
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.240
所以现在的问题应该是
So I guess the real question's gonna be,


472
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.580
我们要用多少钱向你买
what do we pay you to have Yang and his memories


473
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.290
杨和他的记忆
in our collection?


474
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.750
能再给我一份这个吗
Could I have another one of these, please?


475
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.100
接听电话
Answer call.


476
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.730
- 你好  - 你好 美香还好吗
- Hey. - <i>Hey. How's Mika?</i>


477
00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.060
她在隔壁
She's next door.


478
00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.400
隔壁? 乔治家吗
Next door? At George's?


479
00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.690
<i>对
Yep.</i>


480
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.780
为什么
Why?


481
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.570
因为你不在家 而我要工作
Because you're not here, and I have work to do.


482
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.950
我在照顾杨
I'm taking care of Yang.


483
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.280
<i>是吗
Is that what you're doing?</i>


484
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.370
是的
Yes.


485
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.230
所以你就这样把她丢到隔壁去了?
So you just dropped her off over there?


486
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.900
不是 他的两个女儿找她过去玩
No, his daughters invited her over to play.


487
00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.400
你不要再对乔治这么苛刻了
You need to stop being so hard on George.


488
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.950
他挺喜欢你的 也很爱帮忙
He likes you, and he's being really helpful.


489
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.110
他的孩子是克隆人
His kids are clones.


490
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.370
我不想再谈这个了
I don't want to talk about this again.


491
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.370
而且他看比赛的时候会把脸画花
And he paints his face for sporting events.


492
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.580
- 你有什么问题吗  - 他有什么问题吗
- What is wrong with you? - What's wrong with him?


493
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.290
别这样了 行吗
You need to stop. Okay?


494
00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.930
拉面好吃吗
How's the ramen?


495
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.260
很治愈
It's, um, soothing.


496
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.060
是吧 看出来了
Yeah, I can see that.


497
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.600
你在吃什么
What are you having?


498
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.480
拉面
Ramen.


499
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.360
是吗 有意思
Really? That's funny.


500
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.400
<i>有意思吗
Is it?</i>


501
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.490
有点 你不觉得吗
Sort of, don't you think?


502
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.620
杨就快修好了吗
Are you any closer to getting Yang fixed?


503
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.870
这已经是你带他去的第三个地方了
This is the third place you've taken him to.


504
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.620
他其实还在修理店
Well, he's actually still at the repair shop.


505
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.920
我把一个部件拿给
I'm, uh, having a part examined.


506
00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.710
专家检查
By a specialist.


507
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.300
那他很快就能重新启动了吗
So is he gonna be up and running again soon?


508
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.510
不确定 你知道 这东西很复杂的
I'm not sure. You know, it's... it's complicated.


509
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.390
是美香回来了 我得挂了
That's Mika. I got to go.


510
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.110
和其他读卡器一样使用
Functions like any other reader.


511
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.440
使用起来应该很方便
Should be intuitive.


512
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.530
需要输入什么密码吗
Do I need a code?


513
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.530
对 你买杨的时候应该有一张
Yeah, there should be a certification card


514
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.610
认证卡
that came with Yang.


515
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.950
上面有一个序列号和一个识别码
There's a serial number and a pin on it.


516
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.580
还有 依照我们的约定
Also, per our agreement,


517
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.790
你明天要把杨的躯体带来
you'll need to bring Yang's body here tomorrow.


518
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:16.870
- 越快越好  - 好的
- Sooner the better. - Yes.


519
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:17.960
要是拉斯试图更换部件
I wouldn't be surprised


520
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.920
或是偷拿原装部件
if Russ is trying to replace parts


521
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.960
我是不会惊讶的
and steal the originals.


522
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.210
我们会把杨的躯体以生物状态保存在这里
We will keep Yang's body preserved here in a bio-state


523
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.930
与此同时 你去查看内存
while you go and review the memories


524
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.970
决定下一步该怎么办
and decide what you want to do next.


525
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.640
好的 谢谢
Okay. Yeah. Thank you.


526
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.770
谢谢你
Thank you.


527
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.640
我一生都致力于理解机器人智慧
I've dedicated my life to understanding techno-sapiens.


528
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.400
这是…天赐的礼物
This... This is a gift.


529
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.300
<i>我想要
I want to be</i>


530
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.930
<i>像风一样
Just like the wind</i>


531
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.970
<i>在空中飘着
Just flowing in the air</i>


532
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.900
<i>在空地飘着
Flowing in open space</i>


533
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.020
杨教你的吗
Yang taught you that?


534
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.070
是啊 这是他最喜欢的歌
Uh-huh. It's his favorite song.


535
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.860
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?


536
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:31.950
很喜欢
I love it.


537
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.830
嗨
Hey.


538
00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.330
美香这么晚还没睡
Mika's up late.


539
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:46.960
她睡不着
She couldn't sleep.


540
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.630
你要去哪儿吗
You going somewhere?


541
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.130
布伦达要我一起到公司
Brenda's meeting me at the office.


542
00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.050
我们准备通宵工作
We're gonna stay overnight and work.


543
00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.470
进度慢了
We're behind.


544
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.430
对不起 我没有早点回来
Sorry I wasn't here earlier.


545
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.640
没事
It's fine.


546
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.610
明天你要送美香去学校
You'll need to take Mika to school


547
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:07.820
帮她准备好各种东西
and get her ready for the day.


548
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.650
你能做到吗
Do you think you can do that?


549
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:10.980
当然可以
Yeah, of course.


550
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.320
好的 我得走了
All right. I need to go.


551
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.820
我们…我们之间没事吧
Are we... Are we okay?


552
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.000
所以那个部件怎么了
So what did the part reveal?


553
00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.540
部件?
The part?


554
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.840
那个部件
The part.


555
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.710
专家?
The specialist?


556
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.050

Is it about tea?

Yeah.

Okay.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.180
你平时都会这样吗
Is this something you do?


601
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.600
半夜出来倒水喝
Do you get yourself water in the middle of the night?


602
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.020
哥哥常常和我一起
<i>Gege</i> usually comes with me.


603
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.110
这样吗 所以你会把他叫醒?
Is that right? So you'd wake him up?


604
00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.700
他需要睡觉吗
Does he sleep?


605
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.660
他不需要
No, I don't think so.


606
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.200
我一般只需要叫一声 哥哥
I usually just say, <i>"Gege."</i>


607
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.210
不用很大声 因为即使我悄悄地说
Not very loudly because he can hear me


608
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.040
他都能听见
even when I whisper.


609
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.550
我说 "哥哥 我想去倒水喝"
I say, <i>"Gege,</i> I want to get some water."


610
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.340
他就会在走廊和我碰头
Then he joins me in the hallway,


611
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.550
然后我们悄悄地走到厨房
and we walk quietly to the kitchen.


612
00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.310
你为什么不让他去倒水给你喝呢
Why don't you just ask him to get you a glass of water?


613
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.810
这样你就不用下床了
Then you can stay in bed.


614
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.020
我喜欢自己倒水喝
I like getting my own water.


615
00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.990
<i>什么叫你要把他拿回去
What do you mean you want him back?</i>


616
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.080
<i>就是我要把他拿回去的意思
I mean I want him back.</i>


617
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.870
麦克斯给你做读卡器了吗
Did Max make the reader for you?


618
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.000
麦克斯已经不在那里了
Max isn't there anymore.


619
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.540
- 那他在哪里  - 我不知道
- Where is he? - I don't know.


620
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.380
我猜他是被抓了
I bet they took him.


621
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.840
不敢相信 他们终于抓住他了
I can't believe they finally got him.


622
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.600
拜托 让我把杨带走
Please, just let me have Yang back.


623
00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.850
给我一个解释
I want an explanation.


624
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.730
杨是我们的 我…
Yang belongs to us. I...


625
00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.610
我不需要向你解释
don't need to give you an explanation.


626
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:28.790
会没事的
It'll be all right.


627

我的天 我好喜欢文化机器人
God, I love cultural technos.


628
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.300
而且在他们被用于
And since they're used


629
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.470
收养和语言学习后
for adoptions and language learning,


630
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.010
他们并不需要进行多大的改变
they haven't had to change much over the years.


631
00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:45.180
不需要变得更快或更强
No need to be faster or stronger.


632
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.440
这里有些损坏
There's some damage here.


633
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.770
该死的拉斯 他强行把他打开了
Damn Russ just hacked his way into the core.


634
00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.650
其实是有正确的打开方式的
There's a proper way of opening it.


635
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.730
所以 如果你不介意的话
So if you don't mind,


636
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.530
我们要对他进行全面检查
we're just gonna do a full check-up,


637
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.990
然后尽我们所能把他修复好
and we're gonna restore Yang as best we can.


638
00:42:58.530 --> 00:42:59.530
那真是太好了
Oh, that would be great.


639
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.660
修复并不能帮他重启
It won't help with his off state,


640
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.290
但可以有利于保存
but it should help with his preservation.

<i>你喜欢茶的什么

你是说什么味道吗
Do you mean the taste of tea?


667
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.600
可能吧 你是因为喜欢茶的味道吗
Maybe. Is the taste why you like tea?


668
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.650
有点关系吧
It has something to do with it.


669
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.610
所以你把你的一生都献给了茶?
Is it why you've given your life to tea?


670
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:23.360
把我的一生献给茶
Given my life to tea,


671
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.240
这么说感觉太严肃了
well, that sounds pretty serious.


672
00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.620
这不是一件严肃的事吗
Is it not serious?


673
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.410
我想是因为我学会了品茶
I guess I've acquired a taste for tea.


674
00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.120
但这不是我感兴趣的原因
But it's not why I became interested.


675
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.000
感兴趣
Interested.


676

我想一开始吸引我的
I think what I was really drawn to


677
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.300
原因是…
at the beginning was...


678
00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.380
我想一开始
I think what I was really drawn to


679
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.970
吸引我的原因是茶这个概念
at the beginning was the idea of tea.


680
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:48.050
茶这个概念
The idea of tea.


681

茶这个概念
The idea of tea.


682
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.560
对 我在大学的时候
Yeah, I saw this old documentary


683
00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.850
看了一部老纪录片
when I was in college.


684
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:55.980
那是二十世纪的
It was from the 20th century.


685
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.440
它讲的是一个人
And it was about this man


686
00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.770
<i>在寻找中国最好的茶
searching for the best tea in China.</i>


687
00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.570
它讲的是一个人在寻找中国最好的茶
It's about a man searching for the best tea in China.


688
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:02.900
中国是茶起源的地方
China is where tea started.


689
00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.980
对 你应该知道许多
Yes, I'm sure you have


690
00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.190
中国关于茶的小知识
lots of interesting facts about tea in China.


691
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.280
是的
I do.


692
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.030
你想听我说几个吗
Would you like to hear some of them?


693
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:11.700
下次吧
Maybe another time.


694
00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.000
不好意思 你刚刚在说
I'm sorry, you were saying


695
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.460
一个人去找茶
about the man searching for tea.


696
00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.750
对 对
Yeah. Yeah.


697
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.540
其实 就是这样
Yeah, actually, I think that's it.


698
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.670
我觉得是他的寻觅促使我这么做的
I think it was his searching that compelled me.


699
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.800
寻觅这种虚幻的东西
You know, the pursuit of this illusive thing,

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.340
这一过程与泥土
this process that was connected to the soil,


701
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.890
与植被 与天气 与生活方式相连
to the plants, to the weather, and to a way of life.


702
00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:37.430
与生活方式
To a way of life.


703
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:41.190
所以这是你喜欢茶的地方
So that's what you like about tea?


704
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.780
是这种寻觅 而不是它的味道
The search, not so much the taste.


705
00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.360
不不 味道也是
No, no, no, the taste, too.


706
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.700
电影里…
There's this, uh...


707
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.290
电影里有这么一段
There's this part in the film,


708
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:59.790
这段很有意思 那个人
it's a great part, where the man


709
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.790
在向他的德国朋友解释
is explaining to his German friend


710
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.170
为什么茶的味道那么难以形容
why it's so difficult for him to describe the taste of tea.


711
00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.630
他说 "这是无法用语言形容的
He says, "There's no language for it.


712
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.090
"没有任何词汇能够充分表达
"There are no words to adequately express


713
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.180
"茶的玄妙"
"the mysterious nature of tea."


714
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.640
然后他的德国朋友
And his German friend,


715
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.890
站在他身边
who's just standing right beside him


716
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.310
捧着一杯茶说
with a cup of tea, says,


717
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:20.390
"对 但我会想象
"Yes, but I imagine things


718
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.980
"走在森林中
"like you are walking through a forest,


719
00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.610
"地上有落叶
"and there are leaves on the ground,


720
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.900
"刚下过雨 现在雨停了
"and it just had rained, and the rain has stopped,


721
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.030
"空气潮湿 而你就这么走着
and it's damp, and you walk,


722
00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:36.240
"不知怎么的 这种感觉都在茶里了"
"and somehow, that is all in this tea."


723
00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.670
我太喜欢这段了
I mean, I loved that so much.


724
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:46.630
太喜欢了
I loved that so much.


725
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.380
"不知怎么的 这种感觉都在茶里了"
"Somehow, that is all in this tea."


726
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.050
<i>"不知怎么的 这种感觉都在茶里了"
"Somehow, that is all in this tea."</i>


727
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.510
我看了一遍又一遍
God, I watched it over and over again.


728
00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:54.180
我看了一遍又一遍
God, I watched it over and over again.


729
00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.010
我想看看这部电影
I would like to watch this movie.


730
00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:00.350
也许我们可以一起看
Well, maybe we can do it together.


731
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.810
那好啊
Yes. That would be nice.


732
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.440
所以你相信吗
So do you believe it?


733
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.860
相信什么
What's that?


734
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.490
一茶一世界
That a cup of tea can contain a world?


735
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:17.160
茶里可以品出一个地方 一段时间?
That you could taste a place, a time?


736
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.290
我们来试一试 怎么样
Let's put it to the test, shall we?


737
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.820
先闻一闻
So you want to smell it first.


738
00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.700
你知道 这里不止有
You know, there's not just


739
00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.530
味道和气味 还有历史
flavor and the aroma, there's history, too.


740
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:00.950
你知道吗 传统上来说
You know, traditionally,


741
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.960
茶铺都是家族
tea shops that were family businesses


742
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.330
一代一代…
passed down from one generation to an...


743
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:05.420
<i>一代一代…
Were passed down from...</i>


744
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.330
传承的 这你知道的
generation to, you know this,


745
00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.710
传承的
from generation to generation.


746
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:10.710
或许是时候我教你这一行了
Maybe it's time I started teaching you the trade.


747
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:14.050
看看我们能不能一起品味世界
Let's see if we can taste the world together.


748
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.300
一口喝完
Drink it all at once.


749
00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:36.150
你觉得怎么样
What did you think?


750
00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.450
我不确定我有没有品出森林的味道
I'm not sure if I can taste the forest.


751
00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:47.460
那你品出了什么吗
Do you taste anything?


752
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.800
也许我没有语言来形容
Maybe I haven't the language for it.


753
00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.350
我希望中国茶对我来说不止是知识而已
I wish Chinese tea wasn't just about facts for me.


754
00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.220
这是什么意思
What do you mean?


755
00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.230
我喜欢看你泡茶的样子
I like watching the way you make tea.


756
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.440
非常优美
It's very beautiful.


757
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:17.320
我喜欢茶叶绽放 翻滚 落下的样子
The way the leaves bloom and float and fall.


758
00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.660
我希望我能感受到更深层的东西
I wish I felt something deeper about tea.


759
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.370
我希望我有关于中国茶的真实的记忆
I wish I had a real memory of tea in China.


760
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.090
关于一个地方
Of a place.


761
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.170
关于一段时间的记忆
Of a time.


762
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:38.550
我觉得这会是…
I think this would...


763
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.140
什么
What?


764
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:55.980
抱歉 我思路断了
Sorry. I lost my train of thought.


765
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.290
你快乐吗 杨
Are you happy, Yang?


766
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:12.130
<i>我不知道可不可以问我这个问题
I don't know if that's the question for me.</i>


767
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.090
我不知道可不可以问我这个问题
I don't know if that's the question for me.

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:14.610
你见过?
You have?


840
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:16.990
见过几次 在你家
A couple times. At your place.


841
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:19.030
你和她说过话吗
Did you ever talk to her?


842
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:22.580
说过一次 杨让我不要说
Once. Yang asked me not to say anything.


843
00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:23.660
为什么
Why?


844
00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:25.670
你不喜欢克隆人吧
You don't like clones, right?


845
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:29.380
- 不是的  - 维姬 别这么直接
- No, no, it's not... - Come on, Vic. No fastballs.


846
00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:30.840
我只是…我从来没有…
I just... I've never had the...


847
00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.630
- 没事  - 有事
- It's... It's fine. - No, it's not.


848
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.300
维姬
Vicky.


849
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.470
她是克隆人
She's a clone.


850
00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.220
是吗
She is?


851
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:42.020
是的 但是她很酷 人也很好 就像我们大部分克隆人一样
Yeah, but she's really cool and nice. Like most of us.


852
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.020
那肯定
I'm sure.


853
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.480
你知道她叫什么名字吗
Um, do you know her name?


854
00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:52.570
叫艾迪还是艾达之类的
It's Aidy or Ada, something like that.


855
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.780
好的 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.


856
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:58.990
我向你道歉如果我之前…
Look, I'm sorry if I've ever...


857
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:00.160
我可以走了吗
Can I go now?


858
00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.040
可以 谢谢 亲爱的
Yes. Thank you, sweetheart.


859
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:11.920
我真的很抱歉
I'm... I'm really sorry, it's...


860
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.710
没事 没事 真心的
No, no, no, it's... Honestly.


861
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:15.800
你应该看看她的投球
You should see her fastball.


862
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.890
她真的是…
I mean, she's just...


863
00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:21.180
可以一整天…
...like, all day long. I mean...


864
00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:24.850
谢谢 乔治 我真的得…
Well, thanks, George. I really have to...


865
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.350
- 下次聊  - 嗯
- Another time. - Yeah.


866
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:31.690
或者什么时候可以一起喝一杯?
Uh, hey, maybe we can get a drink together, huh? Sometime?


867
00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:34.400
嗯 当然可以
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.


868
00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:51.920
我想见哥哥
I want to see <i>gege.</i>


869
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:55.300
我知道 宝贝
I know, love.


870
00:59:56.130 --> 01:00:00.640
你想他 我也想 但现在没法见他
You miss him. Me, too. We just can't see him now.


871
01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.220
那家庭舞蹈大赛怎么办
What about the family dance?


872
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:08.060
我们再也不能跳了吗
Are we never gonna dance again?


873
01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.730
当然不会
Of course we will.


874
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:15.360
但我们可能要参加三人家庭的比赛了
But we might have to compete in the family of threes.


875
01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.400
我不想参加三人家庭的
I don't want to be a family of three!


876
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.490
美香
Mika.


877
01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:22.530
我要哥哥回来
I want <i>gege</i> back!


878
01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:27.960
爸爸正在努力 他正在尽全力
Daddy's trying his best. He's doing everything he can.


879
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.330
我也希望他回来
I want him back, too.


880
01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.760
你呢 妈妈 你希望他回来吗
What about you, Mom? Do you want him back?


881
01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.130
当然
Of course I do.


882
01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.650
这件事实在是拖太久了
This is dragging on too long.


883
01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:56.190
我还需要一点点时间
I just need a little more time.


884
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:59.190
我们应该开始把注意力放在美香身上了
Oh, we need to start focusing on Mika.


885
01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:02.240
我们这样只会让她更难受的
We're just making things more difficult for her.


886
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.500
杰克 你听到了吗
Jake, do you hear me?


887
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.960
如果我们不能把杨修好的话 我们…
If we can't get Yang fixed, we just...


888
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.460
我们要往前看了 好吗
we need to move forward. Okay?


889
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:19.470
好了 好了
Now. Now.


890
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.430
我有事情要告诉你
I need to tell you something.


891
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.110
<i>不是 它卡住了
No, it's... it's frozen.</i>


892
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.660
有意思
That's interesting.


893
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.080
试试执行"记忆显示信息"
Try command "memory reveal info,"


894
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.750
它会告诉你有没有损坏
and it should tell you if it's corrupt or not.


895
01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:50.830
好的 我会试一下
Okay, I'll do that.


896
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.170
对了 我在想
Also, I was wondering,


897
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:57.000
像杨这样的文化机器人
is it possible for cultural technos like Yang to


898
01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:00.130
是不是可能产生感情
want to have romantic potential?


899
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.260
你是说对于使用他们的人类吗
Do you mean for humans to use them?


900
01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:06.390
不不不 我是说杨对其他人…
No, no, no, I mean, for Yang to be interested in...


901
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:09.640
有个女孩子 她在杨的记忆里
There's a girl, and she showed up in his memories,


902
01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.390
而且我们完全不认识她
and, you know, we didn't know anything about her.


903
01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.600
真的吗
Really?


904
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:15.600
太不可思议了
That's fascinating,


905
01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.820
因为我从来没有听过文化机器人
because I've never heard of cultural technos


906
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.110
可以有这种能力 你不知道…
having that capacity. I cannot tell you how much...


907
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:22.700
杨和他的记忆…
...Yang and his memories...


908
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.530
我要过去一下
I should get that.


909
01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.070
好吧 不过我们很快会再联络的吧
Oh, all right, okay. But we'll touch base soon?


910
01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.120
- 嗯 好的  - 好的
- Yeah, let's do that. - Great.


911
01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.500
你在找我吗
You've been looking for me?


912
01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.670
对
Yes.


913
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:40.960
我是杰克
I'm Jake.


914
01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.010
我知道
I know.


915
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.090
我是艾达
I'm Ada.


916
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.850
艾达 请进
Ada. Well, come in, please.


917
01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:51.600
我就知道出事了
I knew something was wrong.


918
01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.730
我们常常见面 而他不回我信息了
We usually meet, and he wasn't answering my messages.


919
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:02.690
真抱歉
I'm sorry.


920
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.780
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.


921
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.290
我知道杨很高兴成为这个家的一份子
I know Yang loves being a part of this family.


922
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:22.130
我能问问你们是怎么认识的吗
Can I ask how you met?


923
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:25.170
在咖啡店
At the coffee shop.


924
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.340
他接近你的吗
He approached you?


925
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:32.970
他是常客
He was a regular customer.


926
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:36.520
他总是来买东西
He used to buy things all the time, which,


927
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.020
所以当我发现他是机器人之后我觉得很好笑
you know, was funny when I found out he was a techno.


928
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.070
但是 嗯…我们开始聊天 然后…
But, yeah, we started talking, and...


929
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.700
某一次 他问我想不想做点什么事
eventually, he asked me if I wanted to do something.


930
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:51.160
你和杨…
Were you and Yang...


931
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:53.700
你们…
Were you guys...


932
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.300
我们从来没有这样说过我们的事
Well, we never really talked about us in that way.


933
01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.730
不好意思 那是我太太 我要去…
Sorry, that's... That's my wife. I need to...


934
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.030
- 嗯  - 抱歉
- Yeah. - Sorry.


935
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.570
请你…不要离开
Please... don't leave.


936
01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:38.210
她崩溃了 你得去接她
She's freaking out. You need to pick her up.


937
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:39.330
她怎么了
What's she doing?


938
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:40.580
他们说她打了一个孩子
They said she punched a kid,


939
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:42.250
然后开始对所有人大喊大叫
and then she started screaming at everyone.


940
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:44.630
- 天呐  - 你现在能去接她吗
- Holy shit. - Are you able to get her now?


941
01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:47.380
可以 我这就出发
Yeah. Uh, yeah. I'm on my way.


942
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.130
谢谢
Thank you.


943
01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:53.720
我想见他
I want to see him.


944
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:00.440
美香
Mika...


945
01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.730
杨非常爱你
Yang loves you so much.


946
01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.740
他总是说起你
He always talks about you.


947
01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.340
- 谢谢你让我们进来  - 没事 我理解
- Thanks again for this. - Oh, I understand.


948
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.010
相信大家都很想念他
I'm sure everyone misses him a lot.


949
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.060
美香
Mika.


950
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:48.820
<i>哥哥

<i>哥哥
Gege!</i>


954
01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.590
他会有自己的一块区域
He would have his own area.


955
01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:58.470
我们会循环播放他的一些记忆
We could put some of his memories on a loop,


956
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.970
大屏播放
projected,


957
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.020
或是给游客提供读卡装置
or on a set of readers that visitors could wear.


958
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:17.910
当然 每段记忆都会经过你的同意
Of course, any memory would have to be approved by you.


959
01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.890

对 越来越多了
Yes, it's getting bigger.


964
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:31.210
你希望我到此为止吗 我可以把一部分收起来
Do you want me to stop now? I can put some away.


965
01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:33.500
不用 我不是在抱怨
No, no. I'm not complaining.

969
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:41.590
最喜欢的主题之一
in the mid-1800s?


970
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.590
这我不知道
No, I did not know that.


971
01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.010
中国人喜爱蝴蝶
The Chinese love butterflies.


972
01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:49.060
还有一个家喻户晓的民间传说

973
01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:52.020

who die of broken hearts and reemerge as butterflies.


974
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.650
还有 中国古代哲学家老子曾说

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:05.490
我喜欢这句话
I like that.


978
01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.120
我喜欢这句话
I like that.


979
01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:15.710
这是你相信的东西吗
Is this something you believe?


980
01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.800
- 什么  - 就是结束…
- Hmm? - That the end...


981
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.970
结束也是一种开始
That the end is also a beginning?


982
01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:23.220
也是
...is also


983
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:25.220
开始
the beginning?


984
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:29.970
对于毛毛虫来说
For the caterpillar...


985
01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.480
对于毛毛虫来说 是的
For the caterpillar, yes.


986
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.940
那你觉得一切都是如此吗
But do you believe it's true for all things?


987
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.530
我不知道
I don't know.


988
01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:45.450
我没有被设定为这样的思维方式
I'm not programmed to believe in that way.


989
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:47.160
你呢
What about you?


990
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:54.000
我愿意去相信
I'd like to believe that.


991
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.040
是吗
Do you?


992
01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.630
是吗
Do you?


993
01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:03.130
有时候我觉得
Sometimes I think


994
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.760
人类被设定为
humans are programmed


995
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.350
去相信这样的东西 但…
to believe in such things, but...


996
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:14.980
我不知道这样对我们是不是最好的
I don't know if it's really in our best interest.


997
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:20.070
我可以和你说实话吗
May I be honest with you?


998
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.610
可以 等等…
Yes. Wait, is...


999
01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:26.740
你可以选择不说实话吗
Is not being honest an option for you?


1000
01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.780
应该不行吧
I don't think so.


1001
01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.170
继续
Go on.


1002
01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:47.930
我不介意最后化为虚无
I'm fine if there's nothing in the end.


1003
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.680
是吗
Are you?


1004
01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.560
也许我是这样被设定的
Maybe I was programmed this way as well.


1005
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:12.830
你因此感到过伤心吗
Does it ever make you feel sad?


1006
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:27.090
有无相生
There's no something without nothing.


1007
01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.810
你因此感到过伤心吗
Does it ever make you feel sad?


1008
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:45.820
有无相生
There's no something without nothing.


1009
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:48.610
老子说的?
Lao Tzu?


1010
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.360
我不确定
I'm not sure.


1011
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.640
杨因为是机器人感到过痛苦吗
Did Yang ever struggle with being a techno?


1012
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:23.690
这是什么意思
What do you mean?


1013
01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:29.320
我是说 他是不是曾经想成为人类
I mean, did he ever... want to be human?


1014
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:35.620
什么
What?


1015
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.540
没什么
Nothing.


1016
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:44.210
只不过…
It's just...


1017
01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:46.630
只有人类才会问这样的问题吧
That's such a human thing to ask, isn't it?


1018
01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.210
我们总以为其他物种
We always assume that other beings


1019
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.340
想要成为人类
would want to be human.


1020
01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.010
成为人类有什么好呢
What's so great about being human?


1021
01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.930
所以他从没因此挣扎 从没…有过疑问?
So he never struggled with it? He never... Questioned it?


1022
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:02.850
没对我说过
Not to me.


1023
01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:07.190
这样啊
I see.


1024
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.330
他确实怀疑过他是不是中国人
He did question if he was Chinese.


1025
01:14:19.410 --> 01:14:20.410
是吗
He did?


1026
01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.920
嗯
Yeah.


1027
01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.510
怎么样才算是亚洲人
What makes someone Asian?


1028
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.260
他总是问这个问题
He'd ask that all the time.


1029
01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:40.770
也许他只是想帮美香去明白
Maybe he just wanted to help Mika understand


1030
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:42.480
作为中国人意味着什么
what it means to be Chinese.


1031
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:48.610
他对他妹妹非常用心
He was dedicated to his little sister.


1032
01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.820
嗯 杨是个好哥哥
Yeah, Yang was a good brother.


1033
01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:00.830
他是个特别好的哥哥
He's a great brother.

Hi, uh, could I speak to the owners?


1049

可以 稍等
Uh, yes. One moment.


1050
01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:17.480
<i>他不只是安静

<i>他看起来很沮丧 像是坏了

1052
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:22.280
几天后我们就把他送了回去
We took him back a few days later,


1053
01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.280
然后他们给我们换了一个

1054
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.530
在"兄弟&姐妹"吗

1055
01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:27.330
不是 那家店是…

我们买他的时候不是全新的

不是吗
You didn't?


1059

1063
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:49.600
那你买的时候他是不是已经开机在睡眠状态
I assume he was on when you bought him in a sleep state?


1064
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.770
