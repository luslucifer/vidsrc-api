00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:34.672
BLACK ORPHEUS

2
00:03:38.607 --> 00:03:40.900
Serafina, look what a beauty!

3
00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.229
Forgive me.

4
00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:04.191
Please forgive me.
You really scared me.


5
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.862
You're trembling, poor thing.

6
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.698
I can feel your heart beat
here in your hand


7
00:05:10.866 --> 00:05:13.242
like a caged bird.

8
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.078
Let me give you something
to help you forget.


9
00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.124
Here.
I don't know if it's very pretty.


10
00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:22.043
Oh, but it is.

11
00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:24.712
Thank you very much.

12
00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:28.549
I can help you,
if you don't mind.


13
00:05:28.717 --> 00:05:31.844
But I can't guide you too far.
I don't know Rio.


14
00:05:32.012 --> 00:05:33.971
I'll manage.

15
00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.557
I know this city
like the palm of my hand.


16
00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:39.602
I can even give you directions,
if you wish.


17
00:05:40.187 --> 00:05:41.896
Let's go.

18
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.152
Onions, onions.

19
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:34.407
Wanna buy a steak?

20
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.535
What a beauty!

21
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:46.961
Come walk with me, pretty girl.

22
00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:53.509
The biggest necklaces around!

23
00:07:21.705 --> 00:07:25.416
Who wants to buy a necklace?

24
00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:00.845
Hey there, climb aboard!

25
00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:47.224
This is how our love will be

26
00:09:47.392 --> 00:09:51.270
Me for you and you for me

27
00:10:01.031 --> 00:10:05.868
I've had enough of sadness

28
00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:10.247
I'll make you happy

29
00:10:10.373 --> 00:10:14.418
I want to live in peace

30
00:10:26.598 --> 00:10:27.556
Hermes!

31
00:10:27.724 --> 00:10:30.559
All done, Orfeu?
Gonna get your paycheck?


32
00:10:48.787 --> 00:10:51.080
Hey, what are you doing?

33
00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:55.417
They said to go
to the end of the line.


34
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.420
Well? You're looking at it.

35
00:10:59.256 --> 00:11:00.089
Thank you.

36
00:11:00.257 --> 00:11:02.508
- You're not from around here?
- No.


37
00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:05.386
- Where are you going?
- My cousin's house.


38
00:11:05.553 --> 00:11:08.138
Well, that's okay then.

39
00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:12.643
Hermes, come help this girl.
She's looking for her cousin.


40
00:11:12.894 --> 00:11:15.938
He'll find her for you.
He can find anything.


41
00:11:16.564 --> 00:11:18.941
I gotta go get my paycheck.

42
00:11:21.736 --> 00:11:25.072
One more for your collection, eh?
Cute gal.


43
00:11:26.908 --> 00:11:29.618
- Just some silly girl.
- Yeah, I know you.


44
00:11:29.786 --> 00:11:33.580
- Better watch out. Mira's around.
- Orfeu!


45
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.666
What did I tell you?

46
00:11:40.505 --> 00:11:44.633
Sorry to break up your little party.
You telling her fortune?


47
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:46.427
- Why not?
- Don't bother.


48
00:11:46.594 --> 00:11:48.679
With her looks,
she'll never get lucky.


49
00:11:48.847 --> 00:11:51.515
And a show-off like you
doesn't deserve to get lucky.


50
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.100
You coming?

51
00:11:53.601 --> 00:11:54.977
She's crazy.

52
00:11:55.145 --> 00:11:57.062
Have you been to Carnival?
- No.


53
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.064
You've never been?

54
00:11:59.232 --> 00:12:01.817
Is that why you've come to Rio?
- No.


55
00:12:02.193 --> 00:12:05.237
You'll see.
You'll end up going.


56
00:12:05.655 --> 00:12:07.948
No one can resist the madness.

57
00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:11.118
Now look here.
You can't go wrong.


58
00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:14.413
Just follow that path
and you'll get there.


59
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:17.333
- Thank you very much.
- My name is Hermes.


60
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.169
If you get lost again,
come back and see me.


61
00:12:20.378 --> 00:12:22.629
I'm always here.
I'm the station guard.


62
00:12:22.922 --> 00:12:25.007
Thanks.
I'll be back someday.


63
00:12:27.677 --> 00:12:29.345
You're loaded!

64
00:12:29.804 --> 00:12:31.930
Hand it over!
Let me see!


65
00:12:36.061 --> 00:12:37.853
Did you get directions?

66
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:42.316
Yes, thanks.

67
00:12:43.318 --> 00:12:45.027
- Do you know her?
- No.


68
00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:48.572
- Then why all the fuss?
- 'Cause I'm a nice guy.


69
00:12:48.823 --> 00:12:51.742
- A nice guy.
- Cute, isn't she?


70
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.120
- And I'm not? Let's go.
- Where?


71
00:12:55.372 --> 00:12:57.748
Where?
You hear that, Hermes?


72
00:12:57.916 --> 00:13:00.417
He has the nerve to ask where.

73
00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:03.212
Did you forget
we're getting a marriage license?


74
00:13:03.338 --> 00:13:07.174
Pay attention, man.
- What eyes she has.


75
00:13:07.884 --> 00:13:10.511
And I have the memory
of an elephant, you know?


76
00:13:12.722 --> 00:13:13.847
I know.

77
00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:15.557
Hey, pass it here!

78
00:13:20.563 --> 00:13:22.439
That's enough.

79
00:13:26.277 --> 00:13:30.739
- Where's Court No. 5, please?
- Upstairs, second door on the right.


80
00:13:33.952 --> 00:13:35.953
- Take off that cap.
- Why?


81
00:13:36.121 --> 00:13:38.080
And fix your tie.
What a mess.


82
00:13:38.957 --> 00:13:41.083
Let me fix your tie.

83
00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:44.294
Now give me a kiss.
- People are coming.


84
00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:46.713
Come on.

85
00:13:50.718 --> 00:13:52.636
Marriage licenses?

86
00:13:59.811 --> 00:14:02.646
I'm sorry!
This is for tomorrow.


87
00:14:03.273 --> 00:14:07.484
Well, we want a license today.
We're getting married.


88
00:14:07.652 --> 00:14:09.361
Are you sure?

89
00:14:10.238 --> 00:14:13.699
- Of course.
- Sorry. I was just kidding.


90
00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:18.787
I say that because
everybody comes here to get married.


91
00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:21.290
It's a funny line!

92
00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:26.295
Give me your names.
Let's start with yours.


93
00:14:28.548 --> 00:14:30.632
Orfeu.

94
00:14:33.094 --> 00:14:36.013
Then of course the bride
must be Euridice.


95
00:14:36.139 --> 00:14:39.475
What? My name's not Euridice.
Why do you say that?


96
00:14:40.685 --> 00:14:43.270
"Orpheus loves Eurydice."
Everyone knows that.


97
00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:46.315
Do you love some girl
named Euridice?


98
00:14:46.816 --> 00:14:49.651
I don't know any Euridice.
What is this?


99
00:14:49.903 --> 00:14:52.529
Nothing.
Just an old story.


100
00:14:52.697 --> 00:14:54.156
I was being funny.

101
00:14:54.282 --> 00:14:56.074
It wasn't funny at all.

102
00:14:56.242 --> 00:14:59.119
Not another word
about some old stories, you hear?


103
00:14:59.287 --> 00:15:00.913
That's enough.

104
00:15:01.331 --> 00:15:03.332
My name is Mira.

105
00:15:38.201 --> 00:15:39.743
Mira, let's go!

106
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.460
Happy now?
You got what you wanted.


107
00:15:48.628 --> 00:15:51.338
- You gonna buy the ring now?
- What ring?


108
00:15:51.506 --> 00:15:55.217
We're engaged now.
You have to give me a ring.


109
00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:59.680
- With what money?
- I saw your paycheck. Let's go!


110
00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:01.390
You won't do it?

111
00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:05.852
I've gotta get my guitar out of hock.
Tomorrow is Carnival.


112
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.481
A ring.
Buy your own ring.


113
00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:13.277
- No, you have to give me one!
- I said I have no money!


114
00:16:14.404 --> 00:16:17.406
- I can loan you some.
- All right.


115
00:16:17.824 --> 00:16:20.701
But you have to get me a ring.
Come on!


116
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.703
Now what?

117
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:24.621
First my guitar.

118
00:16:39.178 --> 00:16:40.762
104.

119
00:16:41.723 --> 00:16:43.432
310.

120
00:16:44.434 --> 00:16:45.892
102.

121
00:16:46.185 --> 00:16:47.769
340.

122
00:16:47.979 --> 00:16:49.479
350.

123
00:16:50.607 --> 00:16:52.566
Orfeu.

124
00:17:09.876 --> 00:17:12.127
You're gonna look like a king!

125
00:17:12.754 --> 00:17:14.588
I am a king.

126
00:17:22.805 --> 00:17:26.642
Sorry, but those crooks
aren't interested in this.


127
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:29.269
Hold it a minute.
It works great.


128
00:17:29.437 --> 00:17:35.150
A museum would pay a lot more
than 100 cruzeiros for this.


129
00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:37.778
Quiet, everyone!

130
00:17:37.945 --> 00:17:41.073
Just 100 cruzeiros.
- I'm on to you.


131
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.869
I just need 100 cruzeiros for Carnival,
but they won't give it to me.


132
00:17:47.163 --> 00:17:50.332
Here are 100 cruzeiros.
Now take this thing back!


133
00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:53.418
- A hundred cruzeiros! Great!
- Take this damn thing away!


134
00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:55.879
No, it's yours now.

135
00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:58.715
Hold on.
The rest is yours!


136
00:18:10.186 --> 00:18:12.020
You think it's funny, huh?

137
00:18:13.022 --> 00:18:15.023
You got a good deal.

138
00:18:16.234 --> 00:18:18.777
- Hold this piece of junk.
- Wait a minute.


139
00:18:19.696 --> 00:18:21.154
Take this.

140
00:18:25.743 --> 00:18:27.703
Don't get mad, all right?

141
00:18:28.037 --> 00:18:29.830
Isn't it a beauty?

142
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:35.877
- It is pretty.
- But you owe me 110 bucks.


143
00:18:36.295 --> 00:18:38.839
- What?
- 110 bucks.


144
00:18:46.764 --> 00:18:49.266
Sad, little birdie?
Hasn't he come yet?


145
00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:51.601
But he will.

146
00:18:51.936 --> 00:18:54.730
Sing, bird, sing.

147
00:18:54.897 --> 00:18:57.065
Serafina, some bread?

148
00:18:57.233 --> 00:19:00.402
Thanks, but I spent
everything on my costume.


149
00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:16.918
Chico!

150
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.421
Oh, it's you.

151
00:19:19.964 --> 00:19:21.173
Good morning.

152
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.884
Good morning.
Come in.


153
00:19:24.218 --> 00:19:27.929
This is all I need.
I thought it was him.


154
00:19:28.055 --> 00:19:29.931
- Who?
- Chico Boto.


155
00:19:30.141 --> 00:19:32.267
That's right -
you don't know him.


156
00:19:32.435 --> 00:19:35.604
Look how handsome.
He's always on the road.


157
00:19:35.772 --> 00:19:37.564
But he promised
to be here for Carnival.


158
00:19:37.732 --> 00:19:39.816
- Your husband?
- No, why?


159
00:19:40.193 --> 00:19:44.279
We just like each other.
And I'm all his.


160
00:19:44.447 --> 00:19:47.824
You should see
the chest on this man.


161
00:19:49.744 --> 00:19:52.621
But that doesn't mean
I'm not happy to see you.


162
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.249
Actually, since he's not here,
it works out great.


163
00:19:56.417 --> 00:19:58.627
Let me guess -
you came for Carnival.


164
00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:01.213
- I ran away.
- Ran away?


165
00:20:01.714 --> 00:20:05.050
- I'm scared, Serafina.
- What's all this about?


166
00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:08.845
Scared of what... or whom?

167
00:20:10.139 --> 00:20:13.975
A man who came to the farm
and kept chasing after me.


168
00:20:14.143 --> 00:20:16.186
Because you're pretty, silly.

169
00:20:16.395 --> 00:20:19.147
No. I'm sure he wants to kill me.

170
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.690
Are you crazy?

171
00:20:20.858 --> 00:20:23.902
He just wants
to get into your pants.


172
00:20:24.195 --> 00:20:27.906
No, he means to kill me.
I know he does.


173
00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:32.452
"I know, I know."

174
00:20:32.662 --> 00:20:35.413
Tell me:
Does he know you're here?


175
00:20:36.332 --> 00:20:40.210
Then put it out of your mind.
Come, you must be starving.


176
00:20:40.503 --> 00:20:42.879
All I have is onions.
You got any money?


177
00:20:43.005 --> 00:20:46.842
Never mind. I only ask
'cause my costume cost a fortune.


178
00:20:46.968 --> 00:20:51.346
But the Portuguese grocer
will do anything for a kiss.


179
00:20:52.765 --> 00:20:55.016
You really are pretty,
you know that?


180
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.314
Good trick.

181
00:21:43.524 --> 00:21:46.234
Hello there, Benedito.
How are you?


182
00:21:46.736 --> 00:21:48.570
Is that amulet for me?

183
00:21:48.738 --> 00:21:50.739
No, it's for her.

184
00:21:50.907 --> 00:21:52.574
You don't even know her.

185
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.201
But I'm going to.
Would you like this?


186
00:21:55.411 --> 00:21:58.705
- Thank you, Benedito.
- You already know my name?


187
00:21:58.873 --> 00:22:02.125
My name's Euridice.
I'll keep this forever.


188
00:22:02.376 --> 00:22:04.544
Even after I die?

189
00:22:04.712 --> 00:22:06.838
Enough nonsense.
Run along now.


190
00:22:07.173 --> 00:22:10.926
That boy has some strange ideas.
Come on.


191
00:22:31.155 --> 00:22:32.781
Now give me a kiss.

192
00:22:32.949 --> 00:22:35.075
- Just one!
- And for you?


193
00:22:35.242 --> 00:22:36.743
Some fish.

194
00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:45.001
Whoever that is,
she's gonna hit me up for credit.


195
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:49.339
Exactly. And with a new
customer like me - sassy and broke.


196
00:22:49.507 --> 00:22:51.758
You'll give us a deal, won't you?

197
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.053
My little dumpling,
just once more, please.


198
00:22:55.179 --> 00:22:57.138
Another customer for credit!

199
00:22:57.306 --> 00:23:00.225
At least nobody owes me anything.

200
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.979
There. That should hold you
for a while.


201
00:23:04.105 --> 00:23:07.899
- Much better. What about her?
- Of course.


202
00:23:08.067 --> 00:23:09.776
Let's have a kiss.

203
00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:14.572
Poor thing's
not used to this yet.


204
00:23:14.907 --> 00:23:16.491
How 'bout a kiss from you?

205
00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:18.785
Forget it.
I'd rather pay.


206
00:23:19.036 --> 00:23:22.872
That's too bad, since her man -
But I better shut up.


207
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.542
Some women
are smarter than you.


208
00:23:25.835 --> 00:23:29.421
- I don't care. That's all just talk.
- Everybody knows.


209
00:23:29.588 --> 00:23:31.047
- What about you?
- Me?


210
00:23:31.215 --> 00:23:34.384
If he's really getting married,
then poor guy.


211
00:23:34.552 --> 00:23:39.139
- Actually, here they come now.
- Both of them?


212
00:23:39.306 --> 00:23:41.433
Take anything you want.

213
00:23:42.184 --> 00:23:43.685
Is everybody crazy?

214
00:23:43.853 --> 00:23:46.438
I'm coming!
Isn’t this beautiful?


215
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.359
- You're not going to see him?
- Who?


216
00:23:51.527 --> 00:23:53.862
- "Who?"
- She doesn't know him yet.


217
00:23:53.988 --> 00:23:58.324
But when she does,
she'll run even faster than the others.


218
00:23:58.492 --> 00:24:01.119
You taking those?
- Forget it. They're still green.


219
00:24:02.163 --> 00:24:05.206
Of course they're green.
You waiting for red chayotes?


220
00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:09.669
It can't be. Poor baby.

221
00:24:09.795 --> 00:24:11.880
Are you really getting hitched?

222
00:24:12.173 --> 00:24:14.883
It's really gone to her head.

223
00:24:15.384 --> 00:24:19.054
Shall I take your little fiancée
off your hands for a while?


224
00:24:19.555 --> 00:24:21.056
May I?

225
00:24:28.773 --> 00:24:31.608
- How did you do it?
- He kept insisting.


226
00:24:31.776 --> 00:24:33.568
I'm so happy!

227
00:24:36.113 --> 00:24:39.866
- You're choking me!
- I'm so happy! Give me a hug!


228
00:24:45.498 --> 00:24:48.249
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's you. Nothing.


229
00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:50.752
I gotta tune my guitar
for rehearsal.


230
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.962
- Orfeu.
- Later, later...


231
00:24:53.756 --> 00:24:56.257
He doesn't want you.
Didn't I tell you?


232
00:24:56.842 --> 00:24:58.885
- Idiot.
- You're the idiot.


233
00:24:59.053 --> 00:25:02.972
- My costume's great!
- I like mine better.


234
00:25:05.684 --> 00:25:07.268
It's so pretty.

235
00:25:07.686 --> 00:25:10.063
- Where's Orfeu?
- Did he leave?


236
00:25:10.397 --> 00:25:13.358
That's right.
He said he'd see us at rehearsal.


237
00:25:13.484 --> 00:25:16.111
What? He could have
at least told me.


238
00:25:16.362 --> 00:25:20.573
The poor thing's so excited,
you know.


239
00:25:20.908 --> 00:25:22.909
Let me see your ring again.

240
00:25:24.328 --> 00:25:27.956
What a beauty. Is it real?

241
00:25:28.249 --> 00:25:29.791
Practically.

242
00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:31.459
Isn’t it pretty?

243
00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:40.260
Orfeu, don't I look great?

244
00:25:40.386 --> 00:25:43.471
Yeah. See you at rehearsal.

245
00:25:44.807 --> 00:25:46.516
How's everybody?

246
00:25:48.727 --> 00:25:50.645
How are you, Caruso?

247
00:25:59.488 --> 00:26:01.739
Always cuddling, huh?

248
00:26:09.456 --> 00:26:11.624
- Ask him.
- No, you ask.


249
00:26:15.462 --> 00:26:17.422
I wanted to ask you something.

250
00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:24.095
Can you really make the sun rise
just by playing your guitar?


251
00:26:26.557 --> 00:26:29.434
- Of course I can.
- Didn't I tell you?


252
00:26:30.019 --> 00:26:32.478
Could you make
the sun rise tomorrow?


253
00:26:34.398 --> 00:26:37.650
Sure. Especially
since tomorrow is Carnival.


254
00:26:37.943 --> 00:26:40.111
What do you play to do that?

255
00:26:41.238 --> 00:26:42.906
I make something up.

256
00:26:43.032 --> 00:26:44.532
Could you do that?

257
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.579
I think I could make up a melody.
Man, I'd love to make the sun rise.


258
00:26:51.624 --> 00:26:53.958
Lend him your guitar.
Just to see.


259
00:26:54.376 --> 00:26:57.045
Look here.
This guitar is very old.


260
00:26:57.379 --> 00:27:01.090
- "Orfeu is my master."
- It's true.


261
00:27:01.717 --> 00:27:03.927
There was an Orpheus before me,

262
00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.763
and there may be another
after I'm gone,


263
00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:09.849
but for now I'm the boss.

264
00:27:09.975 --> 00:27:11.517
Understand?

265
00:27:13.229 --> 00:27:14.729
Don't be sad.

266
00:27:15.064 --> 00:27:17.440
If you promise not to tell,

267
00:27:17.566 --> 00:27:21.194
I'll play you the new song
I just wrote.


268
00:27:42.258 --> 00:27:43.800
Pretty, isn't it?

269
00:27:51.642 --> 00:27:57.605
The dawn of a beautiful morn

270
00:28:00.818 --> 00:28:07.448
A new song is born

271
00:28:09.576 --> 00:28:13.288
It sings of your eyes

272
00:28:13.956 --> 00:28:17.542
Of your laughter and your hands

273
00:28:18.502 --> 00:28:25.008
One day you will come to me

274
00:28:27.469 --> 00:28:34.309
From the strings of my guitar

275
00:28:36.729 --> 00:28:42.567
That seeks only your love

276
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.991
A voice comes forth

277
00:28:51.327 --> 00:28:53.995
That speaks of kisses

278
00:28:54.663 --> 00:29:01.502
Lost on your lips

279
00:29:01.754 --> 00:29:04.464
My heart sings
with newfound happiness


280
00:29:04.631 --> 00:29:07.800
At the dawning of this new love

281
00:29:13.057 --> 00:29:16.726
- What are you doing here?
- I have every right!


282
00:29:16.894 --> 00:29:20.063
- Take the guitar! You didn't see me!
- Okay!


283
00:29:30.366 --> 00:29:32.200
- Isn’t he here?
- Who?


284
00:29:32.493 --> 00:29:34.702
Was that you playing?

285
00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:36.829
Orfeu taught me.

286
00:29:36.955 --> 00:29:38.664
Where is he?

287
00:29:40.292 --> 00:29:42.543
He just left with some woman.

288
00:29:42.711 --> 00:29:44.212
What?

289
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:50.009
Now that you've got the guitar,
play something.


290
00:29:50.135 --> 00:29:51.886
He'll hear me.

291
00:29:52.471 --> 00:29:54.305
Even better. Play.

292
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:08.069
You again?
What are you doing here?


293
00:30:08.946 --> 00:30:13.074
Ah, you didn't tell me
your cousin was Serafina.


294
00:30:14.576 --> 00:30:17.412
Then we're already close friends.
What's your name?


295
00:30:17.704 --> 00:30:20.164
Don't you remember?
I'm Euridice.


296
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.584
Amazing!
No wonder I liked you right away.


297
00:30:23.836 --> 00:30:27.130
"Orpheus likes Eurydice,"
as the story goes.


298
00:30:27.881 --> 00:30:29.632
Are you Orpheus?

299
00:30:30.342 --> 00:30:31.759
From head to toe.

300
00:30:31.927 --> 00:30:34.303
Well... I don't like you.

301
00:30:34.805 --> 00:30:36.556
Yes, you do.

302
00:30:36.974 --> 00:30:40.268
Try to remember.
It's a very old story.


303
00:30:40.936 --> 00:30:43.646
Thousands of years ago,

304
00:30:43.772 --> 00:30:46.399
Orpheus was sad
and melancholic,


305
00:30:47.234 --> 00:30:50.069
like this little bird
trapped in its cage.


306
00:30:51.113 --> 00:30:52.989
But one day,

307
00:30:53.282 --> 00:30:57.869
from the strings of his guitar
that sought only one true love,


308
00:30:58.412 --> 00:31:04.208
a voice spoke to him of lost kisses
from the lips of Eurydice.


309
00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:14.969
Eurydice's lips
trembled anxiously,


310
00:31:15.846 --> 00:31:20.808
and her mouth opened slightly
like a fragrant flower -


311
00:31:22.227 --> 00:31:25.730
No, you're too young
to remember.


312
00:31:25.856 --> 00:31:27.356
But I do.

313
00:31:27.483 --> 00:31:29.859
I remember
the words you sang.


314
00:31:30.486 --> 00:31:33.529
- They were the same words.
- That's right.


315
00:31:34.823 --> 00:31:37.658
But it was the melody
I liked best.


316
00:32:24.831 --> 00:32:26.999
Forgive me, Euridice.

317
00:33:27.185 --> 00:33:28.686
Look.

318
00:33:29.104 --> 00:33:30.521
It's them.

319
00:33:31.481 --> 00:33:33.190
I need to talk to him.

320
00:33:33.442 --> 00:33:35.276
No, leave them alone.

321
00:33:36.862 --> 00:33:39.822
They're waiting
for you at rehearsal!


322
00:33:40.282 --> 00:33:41.616
All right.

323
00:33:43.201 --> 00:33:45.244
I have to go.

324
00:33:46.079 --> 00:33:47.580
I know.

325
00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.875
I'll sing and dance for you.

326
00:33:53.045 --> 00:33:55.463
Will you be there?
- Yes.


327
00:33:57.466 --> 00:34:00.176
Take good care of her.
Let's go.


328
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.638
See you later.

329
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.410
Thanks.

330
00:37:13.954 --> 00:37:16.205
Why aren't you paying
attention to me?


331
00:37:16.373 --> 00:37:18.207
I have no time for that now.

332
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.710
- Answer me!
- Get back to your place!


333
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:46.360
This is how our love will be

334
00:37:46.528 --> 00:37:50.239
Me for you and you for me

335
00:38:02.419 --> 00:38:03.544
Excuse us.

336
00:38:03.712 --> 00:38:06.171
He already saw you.
He's the sun.


337
00:38:06.298 --> 00:38:09.091
Look at Serafina.
She's the Queen of the Night.


338
00:38:09.342 --> 00:38:11.552
Look how happy she is.

339
00:38:36.661 --> 00:38:38.329
And who's she?

340
00:38:38.455 --> 00:38:41.832
That's Mira.
She's the Queen of the Day.


341
00:38:43.168 --> 00:38:45.377
Pretty, isn't she?
- Yes.


342
00:38:45.754 --> 00:38:47.755
She's Orfeu's fiancée.

343
00:39:07.275 --> 00:39:09.568
Look, he's going to kiss her.

344
00:39:16.117 --> 00:39:17.952
- That's enough now!
- What's so funny?


345
00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:21.413
- Nothing! That's enough!
- Why didn't you kiss me?


346
00:39:21.581 --> 00:39:25.042
Leave me alone.
Have you tried on your costumes?


347
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.962
Oh, right. Mira's costume
is a beauty, isn't it?


348
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.131
It has embroidered sleeves.
Let's go see it.


349
00:39:56.074 --> 00:39:58.617
Come and dance, Euridice!

350
00:39:58.785 --> 00:40:01.412
Come on!

351
00:40:40.326 --> 00:40:43.328
- And who's this?
- Ask Orfeu.


352
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:19.800
- I want a costume for her, okay?
- All right.


353
00:42:21.845 --> 00:42:24.805
No one dances
with the ladies like you do.


354
00:42:25.306 --> 00:42:26.765
Leave me alone.

355
00:42:27.517 --> 00:42:30.352
Such a pretty girl.

356
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.480
- Better than Mira, isn't she?
- Much better.


357
00:42:33.648 --> 00:42:36.024
- Smooth operator.
- Stop babbling.


358
00:42:36.192 --> 00:42:38.402
- He has good taste.
- Stop it.


359
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.780
- What's wrong with it?
- Where's her costume?


360
00:42:42.282 --> 00:42:44.366
This is all we have.

361
00:42:44.576 --> 00:42:47.536
A body like this
doesn't need a costume.


362
00:42:47.954 --> 00:42:50.664
Wait. I'll look next door.

363
00:42:53.126 --> 00:42:55.335
- That's right - Mira.
- What about her?


364
00:42:55.503 --> 00:42:57.171
Oh, nothing.

365
00:43:04.929 --> 00:43:07.181
You don't waste any time,
do you?


366
00:43:07.348 --> 00:43:09.391
May I introduce my cousin?

367
00:43:10.185 --> 00:43:12.394
Be good now.
Take care of her.


368
00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.688
I want a pretty costume for her.

369
00:43:14.856 --> 00:43:18.025
- Oh, you...
- I'm serious.


370
00:43:18.193 --> 00:43:20.027
You don't even know her.

371
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.695
Yes, I do.

372
00:43:21.905 --> 00:43:23.530
Look at me.

373
00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:26.033
Look at me.

374
00:43:26.367 --> 00:43:28.869
Oh, my!

375
00:43:29.913 --> 00:43:33.415
Don't look like that.
It's no big deal.


376
00:43:33.708 --> 00:43:36.710
Leave the girl to me.
I'll take care of her.


377
00:43:36.878 --> 00:43:40.297
- I'll help.
- It's about time.


378
00:43:40.423 --> 00:43:43.008
Don't just stand there.
Get going.


379
00:43:43.176 --> 00:43:45.552
Hurry up now.
I'll take care of her.


380
00:43:46.179 --> 00:43:49.181
- Orfeu, is Euridice here?
- Yes. Why?


381
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:51.642
Euridice,
someone's looking for you.


382
00:43:51.809 --> 00:43:53.393
- Who?
- Some man.


383
00:43:53.561 --> 00:43:56.688
- Who is he?
- I don't know. He's not from around here.


384
00:43:59.067 --> 00:44:01.068
Don't be afraid, sweetie.

385
00:44:01.236 --> 00:44:03.946
Tell him she's gone.

386
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:06.907
What are you waiting for?

387
00:44:11.621 --> 00:44:13.205
Calm down.

388
00:44:15.959 --> 00:44:18.043
It's him.

389
00:44:26.344 --> 00:44:28.929
Calm down!
There's nothing to be afraid of!


390
00:44:29.597 --> 00:44:31.306
Take care of her!

391
00:44:31.432 --> 00:44:35.310
- What happened?
- My cousin Euridice's frightened.


392
00:44:35.436 --> 00:44:38.355
- Her name's Euridice?
- Something wrong with that?


393
00:44:38.648 --> 00:44:40.065
Orfeu!

394
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:47.239
What happened, Benedito?

395
00:44:47.407 --> 00:44:49.783
I tried to catch him,
but he threw me to the ground.


396
00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:53.537
- Where did he go?
- I don't know. That way.


397
00:44:54.122 --> 00:44:56.581
Impossible.
There's a cliff there.


398
00:44:56.958 --> 00:44:59.876
- The man ran that way.
- That way?


399
00:45:00.044 --> 00:45:01.628
What's wrong with him?

400
00:45:01.963 --> 00:45:03.630
Take care of him.

401
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.467
- What's going on?
- Nothing.


402
00:45:07.635 --> 00:45:10.679
Who's this Euridice?
Did you two have an affair?


403
00:45:10.805 --> 00:45:12.347
- Let me by!
- Stay here!


404
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.226
If you go...

405
00:45:21.065 --> 00:45:22.816
Did you chase him away?

406
00:45:25.611 --> 00:45:26.820
Serafina!

407
00:45:28.323 --> 00:45:29.906
Euridice!

408
00:45:41.461 --> 00:45:42.753
Is that you?

409
00:45:42.879 --> 00:45:45.172
Serafina, answer me!

410
00:45:49.344 --> 00:45:50.927
Euridice!

411
00:45:56.225 --> 00:45:57.768
Where are you?

412
00:46:00.521 --> 00:46:02.147
Idiot! You scared me!

413
00:46:02.273 --> 00:46:05.400
That's a good one.
I'm the one who scared you?


414
00:46:05.568 --> 00:46:08.111
- Where's my cousin?
- Your cousin?


415
00:46:08.279 --> 00:46:09.696
Yes, my cousin.

416
00:46:09.822 --> 00:46:11.865
Ah, that was your cousin?

417
00:46:12.033 --> 00:46:15.410
- You scared her too, right?
- Who, me?


418
00:46:15.578 --> 00:46:17.913
Fine.
I have to find her.


419
00:46:18.873 --> 00:46:20.540
Hold it.

420
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.626
I came from Montevideo
just to see you.


421
00:46:22.752 --> 00:46:24.711
She'll find her way.

422
00:46:26.339 --> 00:46:28.882
- Where's Euridice?
- He saw her, but she ran off.


423
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.425
Where?

424
00:46:30.593 --> 00:46:32.219
Answer, man.

425
00:46:32.387 --> 00:46:34.179
I don't know. That way.

426
00:46:38.226 --> 00:46:39.893
He'll find her.

427
00:46:44.315 --> 00:46:45.941
Chico!

428
00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:49.403
My love!
- You're suffocating me!


429
00:47:54.635 --> 00:47:57.804
No! He'll kill you!

430
00:48:03.144 --> 00:48:04.978
Take care of her.

431
00:48:06.397 --> 00:48:08.565
I'm not in any hurry.

432
00:48:13.196 --> 00:48:15.655
We'll meet again later.

433
00:48:19.494 --> 00:48:20.827
So long.

434
00:48:56.531 --> 00:48:59.032
You're in my arms, Euridice.

435
00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:04.538
I'll protect you always,
from everything.


436
00:49:06.541 --> 00:49:08.458
I care for you, Euridice.

437
00:49:14.882 --> 00:49:17.551
You'll never be frightened again.

438
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.922
Chico Boto showed up.
You want to stay here?


439
00:49:57.133 --> 00:49:58.425
Yes.

440
00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.970
You needn't be frightened here.
Look here.


441
00:50:02.388 --> 00:50:04.014
They're great.

442
00:50:04.682 --> 00:50:08.226
This guy here will protect you too.
He's a real beast.


443
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:10.812
And then...

444
00:50:11.606 --> 00:50:13.231
there's me.

445
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:17.527
- Let go!
- Orfeu, is that you?


446
00:50:22.617 --> 00:50:25.452
I swear I heard talking.
Didn't you?


447
00:50:25.578 --> 00:50:27.912
- It was the dog.
- Talking?


448
00:50:28.039 --> 00:50:29.873
No. But so what?

449
00:50:35.796 --> 00:50:36.963
Gimme.

450
00:50:38.049 --> 00:50:40.467
- She's in good hands.
- Who?


451
00:50:40.593 --> 00:50:43.678
- My cousin.
- Didn't she run off?


452
00:50:43.971 --> 00:50:47.390
Dummy. Open your mouth
and close your eyes.


453
00:50:47.558 --> 00:50:49.809
Wider.

454
00:51:00.154 --> 00:51:02.405
The dog tore
one of the little animals.


455
00:51:02.573 --> 00:51:05.992
They're not animals.
They're the signs of the zodiac.


456
00:51:06.494 --> 00:51:08.161
It's beautiful.

457
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:11.289
This is where I was born.
My house in the heavens.


458
00:51:11.457 --> 00:51:13.166
A baby sheep?

459
00:51:15.628 --> 00:51:20.298
I'll take the one next door,
so I'll always be near you.


460
00:51:21.842 --> 00:51:23.510
Would you like that?

461
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:39.609
Good night.

462
00:51:41.445 --> 00:51:42.946
Good night.

463
00:51:49.787 --> 00:51:51.496
I'll sleep outside.

464
00:51:51.622 --> 00:51:54.457
I'll be closer to my house
in the heavens...


465
00:51:54.792 --> 00:51:56.459
and yours.

466
00:51:58.337 --> 00:52:00.130
Good night, Euridice.

467
00:52:06.637 --> 00:52:10.640
One... two... three...

468
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.315
- What a ruckus.
- I hope we can get some sleep.


469
00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:48.428
Come here.

470
00:52:50.139 --> 00:52:51.556
Come on.

471
00:52:57.772 --> 00:52:59.397
Got you!

472
00:53:02.359 --> 00:53:04.277
You haven't got me yet!

473
00:53:13.913 --> 00:53:15.997
Come here, Serafina.

474
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:19.834
No, you come catch me.

475
00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.628
I can't.

476
00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:27.133
I'll get you!

477
00:53:28.302 --> 00:53:29.719
Did I hurt you?

478
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:35.600
Poor thing.

479
00:53:41.524 --> 00:53:43.191
Does it still hurt?

480
00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:45.693
No, it's better now.

481
00:53:47.154 --> 00:53:48.613
Wait.

482
00:53:58.958 --> 00:54:00.500
I won, didn't I?

483
00:54:00.668 --> 00:54:02.502
You always win.

484
00:55:49.193 --> 00:55:51.194
Zeca!

485
00:55:55.783 --> 00:55:57.116
Let's go. It's time.

486
00:55:57.284 --> 00:55:58.868
Hurry.

487
00:55:59.036 --> 00:56:00.620
All right, I'm coming.

488
00:56:16.428 --> 00:56:20.014
It's too early to be up, boy.
Let us sleep in peace.


489
00:56:20.182 --> 00:56:22.684
Close that door.
- Yes, Grandma.


490
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.770
Let's go! We're late!

491
00:56:27.106 --> 00:56:29.774
What are those devils
doing at this hour?


492
00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.821
Quiet, Caruso.

493
00:57:13.318 --> 00:57:16.154
He won't find it.
We better tell him.


494
00:57:16.321 --> 00:57:19.532
You're crazy.
Come on, let's watch.


495
00:57:20.034 --> 00:57:21.743
What if he's asleep?

496
00:57:22.911 --> 00:57:24.704
I'll knock on the door.

497
00:57:33.047 --> 00:57:35.006
What did I tell you?

498
00:57:38.177 --> 00:57:44.015
My happiness is dreaming

499
00:57:44.433 --> 00:57:49.729
Deep within
my sweetheart's eyes


500
00:57:50.105 --> 00:57:55.610
It's like this night
passing swiftly by


501
00:57:56.111 --> 00:58:00.156
In search of the dawn

502
00:58:00.657 --> 00:58:05.286
Speak softly, please

503
00:58:06.163 --> 00:58:08.664
So she'll wake up happy

504
00:58:08.832 --> 00:58:11.209
Look! It's rising!

505
00:58:15.255 --> 00:58:20.760
Offering up kisses of love

506
00:58:21.762 --> 00:58:23.137
It's true.

507
00:58:23.305 --> 00:58:28.226
Sadness has no end

508
00:58:30.854 --> 00:58:36.192
But happiness does

509
00:58:39.154 --> 00:58:47.703
Happiness is like a dewdrop

510
00:58:48.539 --> 00:58:52.291
On a flower petal

511
00:58:55.129 --> 00:58:58.172
It shines bright and still

512
00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.468
Then quivers lightly

513
00:59:03.178 --> 00:59:09.225
And falls like a lover's tear

514
00:59:13.814 --> 00:59:15.898
Serafina,
aren't you in costume yet?


515
00:59:16.066 --> 00:59:18.568
No, Chico's here,
and he's always hungry!


516
00:59:18.694 --> 00:59:22.572
You look beautiful!
- Wait, let me get Orfeu!


517
00:59:22.865 --> 00:59:25.449
No, I'm in a hurry.
I'll run on ahead.


518
00:59:29.663 --> 00:59:31.164
Thanks.

519
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.002
- Are you getting married today?
- Orfeu must have forgot.


520
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.421
Why? Didn't he invite you?

521
00:59:42.968 --> 00:59:44.468
Euridice!

522
00:59:47.264 --> 00:59:48.973
So there you two are.

523
00:59:49.141 --> 00:59:52.185
Quick,
get your costume on.


524
00:59:52.352 --> 00:59:54.687
No, not that way!
Come this way!


525
00:59:54.855 --> 00:59:57.899
- In a hurry, aren't we?
- Mira's coming.


526
00:59:58.066 --> 00:59:59.609
So let her come.

527
01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:02.153
Come on.
Aren't you ready yet?


528
01:00:02.279 --> 01:00:05.156
- I'm in no hurry.
- Is he crazy?


529
01:00:05.324 --> 01:00:07.241
Orfeu, you promised me -

530
01:00:07.367 --> 01:00:09.744
I'll keep your scarf.

531
01:00:09.912 --> 01:00:14.165
God, he's acting silly.
What did you do to him?


532
01:00:16.001 --> 01:00:19.212
You're up.
At least say good morning.


533
01:00:19.755 --> 01:00:22.048
- Who's this?
- My cousin.


534
01:00:23.884 --> 01:00:25.259
Your cousin?

535
01:00:27.054 --> 01:00:29.513
Don't start that again.
Go back to sleep.


536
01:00:30.015 --> 01:00:31.557
- I'm hungry.
- Wait.


537
01:00:31.725 --> 01:00:35.686
Always hungry.
Eat and stop bothering me.


538
01:00:35.896 --> 01:00:37.230
God help me.

539
01:00:37.356 --> 01:00:39.732
But what can I do?
I like him.


540
01:00:39.858 --> 01:00:41.943
It happens to everybody.

541
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:44.403
You're the living proof.

542
01:00:45.489 --> 01:00:48.032
Wow.
It looks great on you.


543
01:00:48.158 --> 01:00:50.076
What am I supposed to drink?

544
01:00:50.869 --> 01:00:53.579
Here. Now don't let me
see your face again.


545
01:00:54.414 --> 01:00:57.166
- Nice costume.
- It was Orfeu's idea.


546
01:00:57.334 --> 01:00:59.418
- Lucky you.
- Me?


547
01:00:59.586 --> 01:01:03.589
Carnival's very nice, child,
but Chico leaves again tomorrow.


548
01:01:04.424 --> 01:01:05.925
Button that.

549
01:01:06.093 --> 01:01:09.595
I'd rather fool around with him.
- And I'd rather dance with Orfeu.


550
01:01:09.763 --> 01:01:11.764
Orfeu, open the door!

551
01:01:13.183 --> 01:01:14.767
What a fix.

552
01:01:15.477 --> 01:01:18.604
Say, what if you were
to dance in my place?


553
01:01:19.606 --> 01:01:21.774
Yes! That's it!

554
01:01:23.944 --> 01:01:26.821
- Orfeu, open the door.
- I'm coming.


555
01:01:29.616 --> 01:01:31.534
What are you doing?

556
01:01:32.119 --> 01:01:33.869
Can't you see?

557
01:01:38.166 --> 01:01:39.917
Do I look pretty?

558
01:01:40.961 --> 01:01:43.212
- Yes.
- What's the matter?


559
01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:46.257
You could at least look.

560
01:01:58.061 --> 01:02:00.062
You have a sore throat?

561
01:02:02.774 --> 01:02:05.067
Do you?
- Listen, Mira -


562
01:02:05.193 --> 01:02:07.945
Is this new?
Looks cheap.


563
01:02:08.071 --> 01:02:10.906
What are these little animals?

564
01:02:13.118 --> 01:02:16.746
They're not animals.
They're signs of the zodiac.


565
01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.291
Signs of the zodiac -
you don't say.


566
01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:25.629
And the girl next door took you
to heaven last night, right?


567
01:02:27.215 --> 01:02:28.591
Answer me.

568
01:02:29.509 --> 01:02:32.553
Here's what I think
of that bitch's dirty rag!


569
01:02:32.679 --> 01:02:34.263
I'll show you!

570
01:02:34.389 --> 01:02:35.765
It's her, isn't it?

571
01:02:35.932 --> 01:02:38.642
- Shut up!
- Afraid she'll hear?


572
01:02:39.519 --> 01:02:44.315
Listen, if I see her with you again,
I'll kill her!


573
01:02:47.778 --> 01:02:49.987
We came to help you
carry the sun.


574
01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:53.532
I'll wait for you outside.

575
01:02:59.915 --> 01:03:02.208
Here, take my tambourine.

576
01:03:09.466 --> 01:03:11.926
You look so pretty.

577
01:03:12.594 --> 01:03:15.888
- Who was that shouting next door?
- Oh, nobody.


578
01:03:16.056 --> 01:03:18.265
- Mira?
- Seems you already know.


579
01:03:18.433 --> 01:03:20.851
Orfeu told me everything.

580
01:03:21.228 --> 01:03:24.563
He promised to talk to her.
- I understand.


581
01:03:24.731 --> 01:03:28.192
- Serafina, are you coming?
- I'll be right there!


582
01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.239
She's gonna be furious
if she finds out.


583
01:03:33.407 --> 01:03:35.282
Quick, pull your veil down.
- Now?


584
01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:38.786
Yes, or Mira will think
I've been playing tricks on her.


585
01:03:38.912 --> 01:03:40.955
She can be really mean.

586
01:03:41.248 --> 01:03:42.289
I'm coming!

587
01:03:42.457 --> 01:03:46.502
Chico, wake up and give
my cousin a kiss, quick!


588
01:03:47.421 --> 01:03:49.338
- Your cousin?
- Yes!


589
01:03:50.465 --> 01:03:53.968
- That's her!
- You win the prize for smarts.


590
01:03:54.094 --> 01:03:58.597
She's me now, so kiss her
like it was me, okay?


591
01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:02.268
- Kiss her?
- Yes!


592
01:04:02.853 --> 01:04:04.603
Not here! At the door!

593
01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:06.772
I'm coming!

594
01:04:07.232 --> 01:04:09.817
Kiss her. Hard.

595
01:04:10.944 --> 01:04:12.611
That's enough!

596
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:14.905
Say something to her.

597
01:04:16.241 --> 01:04:18.784
- Like what?
- What do you mean, what?


598
01:04:19.286 --> 01:04:22.913
What? What? What?

599
01:04:23.457 --> 01:04:25.458
I don't even know your cousin.

600
01:04:38.305 --> 01:04:41.432
Look at Serafina's costume.

601
01:04:41.558 --> 01:04:44.101
With all that veil,
you can't see her face.


602
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:46.687
Trust me:
It's better that way!


603
01:04:55.989 --> 01:04:59.116
Orfeu, you gonna
stand there forever?


604
01:04:59.242 --> 01:05:00.659
Let's go.

605
01:05:03.914 --> 01:05:06.540
Run and ask Serafina
if Euridice is coming.


606
01:05:10.712 --> 01:05:13.923
Serafina, Orfeu wants to know
if Euridice's coming.


607
01:05:17.844 --> 01:05:20.262
Why do you have her amulet?

608
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:27.686
- Is it a secret?
- Yes, and only Orfeu can know.


609
01:05:27.854 --> 01:05:30.689
I'll run and tell him
to wait for you.


610
01:06:38.592 --> 01:06:43.554
Your attention, please.
Here comes the best!


611
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.639
The Portela samba school!

612
01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:06.739
Zeca!

613
01:09:06.865 --> 01:09:10.242
Ah, it's you. Come on.
Let's help hold the rope.


614
01:09:14.289 --> 01:09:16.331
Didn't even notice, did you?

615
01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:19.918
- What?
- I don't know. Look at Serafina.


616
01:09:31.848 --> 01:09:34.183
- I love you.
- And I love you, Orfeu.


617
01:09:39.731 --> 01:09:42.775
Let's go!
It's our turn!


618
01:10:32.283 --> 01:10:37.663
Here comes
the United Babylon samba school!


619
01:10:58.434 --> 01:11:03.105
This is how our love will be

620
01:11:03.356 --> 01:11:08.068
Me for you and you for me

621
01:12:13.968 --> 01:12:16.929
- Do you love me?
- Dance in your spot!


622
01:12:22.226 --> 01:12:23.644
Answer me!

623
01:12:23.811 --> 01:12:27.272
I meant to explain earlier.
Now it's too late. Go!


624
01:13:47.186 --> 01:13:50.188
- Where's your cousin?
- She's there and I'm here.


625
01:13:56.696 --> 01:13:59.948
How dare you!
Buy your own!


626
01:14:01.659 --> 01:14:03.618
Zeca, look. Death.

627
01:14:03.995 --> 01:14:06.038
That's just some guy in a mask.

628
01:14:26.142 --> 01:14:27.768
Look!

629
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.110
My amulet!

630
01:14:39.238 --> 01:14:40.405
Euridice!

631
01:14:43.201 --> 01:14:45.952
Careful, Benedito!
Grab it!


632
01:15:20.613 --> 01:15:22.239
Your attention, please!

633
01:15:22.365 --> 01:15:26.743
Will Orfeu,
representative of United Babylon,


634
01:15:26.911 --> 01:15:29.412
please come to the jury stand.

635
01:15:30.498 --> 01:15:33.542
Why did you choose Serafina
to dance with you?


636
01:15:33.668 --> 01:15:35.794
Not now.
The jury's calling me.


637
01:15:35.962 --> 01:15:38.130
Lourdes, come with me.

638
01:15:38.464 --> 01:15:41.883
Orfeu, please report
to the jury stand.


639
01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:05.198
We have to help Euridice!

640
01:16:20.506 --> 01:16:23.967
Thank you.
This belongs to everyone. Look.


641
01:16:30.433 --> 01:16:32.142
I'll kill you!

642
01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:09.346
I'll kill you!

643
01:17:16.062 --> 01:17:17.646
Idiot!

644
01:17:19.941 --> 01:17:21.816
Your attention, please!

645
01:17:21.943 --> 01:17:24.778
Here comes
the Mangueira school!


646
01:17:57.061 --> 01:17:59.145
Euridice!

647
01:18:00.022 --> 01:18:03.441
- Hermes!
- What's wrong, child? Calm down.


648
01:18:03.609 --> 01:18:05.235
He's going to kill me.

649
01:18:05.361 --> 01:18:07.779
Stop crying! Come on.

650
01:18:11.284 --> 01:18:13.118
He's going to kill me.

651
01:18:14.245 --> 01:18:17.205
Go to my house.
You'll be safe there.


652
01:18:17.665 --> 01:18:20.625
I'll tell Orfeu.
- No! I'm so scared.


653
01:18:20.793 --> 01:18:22.794
Calm down, child.

654
01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:26.798
I'll find him for you.
You know the way.


655
01:18:29.635 --> 01:18:31.136
Go, my child.

656
01:18:32.555 --> 01:18:34.472
Don't worry. Go on.

657
01:18:34.682 --> 01:18:37.809
I'll tell Orfeu right away.
Go!


658
01:21:15.593 --> 01:21:18.303
Euridice, where are you?

659
01:21:49.919 --> 01:21:51.544
She's mine now.

660
01:22:43.222 --> 01:22:47.058
It's okay. It's nothing.

661
01:23:03.033 --> 01:23:05.868
- It's over, Orfeu.
- Euridice.


662
01:23:26.599 --> 01:23:28.224
She's dead.

663
01:23:28.392 --> 01:23:30.602
No! I must see Euridice.

664
01:23:30.769 --> 01:23:32.937
You can only see her dead.

665
01:23:34.773 --> 01:23:37.483
They just sent her
to the morgue.


666
01:23:37.735 --> 01:23:40.695
No, she's alive.
I'm going to find her.


667
01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:45.033
It's true, Orfeu. Wait!

668
01:23:45.618 --> 01:23:47.452
May I go?
- Yes.


669
01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:50.872
Orfeu, wait!

670
01:23:52.166 --> 01:23:55.209
- They all react like that at first.
- No.


671
01:23:55.794 --> 01:23:58.129
They loved each other.

672
01:23:58.422 --> 01:24:00.089
It was true love.

673
01:24:00.215 --> 01:24:03.468
True love?
Is there such a thing?


674
01:24:05.304 --> 01:24:06.846
There is.

675
01:24:19.318 --> 01:24:21.611
Orfeu, wait for me!

676
01:24:32.498 --> 01:24:34.332
I'd like some information.

677
01:24:41.131 --> 01:24:44.133
Are you family?
If not, you can't stay here.


678
01:24:52.518 --> 01:24:55.019
This is off-limits.
You can't come in.


679
01:24:57.815 --> 01:24:59.357
Euridice!

680
01:25:01.068 --> 01:25:02.694
Stop!

681
01:25:03.946 --> 01:25:05.321
You can't go up there!

682
01:25:05.781 --> 01:25:07.156
Get out of here.

683
01:25:18.877 --> 01:25:20.378
It went up.

684
01:25:33.642 --> 01:25:34.976
Stop!

685
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:40.356
What do you want?

686
01:25:44.236 --> 01:25:45.903
What are you doing here?

687
01:25:47.114 --> 01:25:50.199
- Nothing.
- Then please leave.


688
01:25:50.534 --> 01:25:52.577
You can't be here,
and we don't have time.


689
01:26:52.012 --> 01:26:54.263
Don't be sad, Orfeu.

690
01:27:30.342 --> 01:27:32.176
The party's over.

691
01:27:33.929 --> 01:27:35.513
Party's over.

692
01:27:43.355 --> 01:27:45.231
Hold this one.

693
01:27:45.899 --> 01:27:49.527
What do you want?
- Hey, I know this guy.


694
01:27:49.695 --> 01:27:51.904
Aren't you Orfeu
of the Babylon school?


695
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:54.949
He's incredible.
A great singer.


696
01:27:55.075 --> 01:27:58.744
Sing that song of yours.
How did it go?


697
01:27:58.954 --> 01:28:01.330
Sing, man.
What's your problem?


698
01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:04.709
- I'm looking for a missing person.
- That's not here.


699
01:28:04.877 --> 01:28:08.462
These are just brawlers.
Missing Persons is in Precinct 12.


700
01:28:08.714 --> 01:28:11.215
- Where's that?
- I'll show you. Come on.


701
01:28:15.304 --> 01:28:17.305
Show me that step you did.

702
01:28:17.514 --> 01:28:21.267
You know, that one that -
Like this.


703
01:28:23.478 --> 01:28:26.731
Okay, get out of here.
That door over there.


704
01:28:27.232 --> 01:28:29.650
Beat it, kid!

705
01:28:32.279 --> 01:28:33.404
Scram!

706
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:12.902
Anybody there?

707
01:29:23.789 --> 01:29:25.665
What are you looking for,
brother?


708
01:29:26.959 --> 01:29:29.126
The Missing Persons department.

709
01:29:31.046 --> 01:29:34.173
There is such a department,

710
01:29:34.758 --> 01:29:37.635
but I never saw
any missing persons there.


711
01:29:37.761 --> 01:29:40.054
Just mountains of paper.

712
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:42.723
Missing Persons is right here.

713
01:29:47.312 --> 01:29:50.314
See? There's no one there.

714
01:29:50.649 --> 01:29:53.150
Just piles of paper.

715
01:29:54.695 --> 01:29:58.656
The whole place is full of it.
Fifteen floors of paper.


716
01:29:59.533 --> 01:30:01.033
All for nothing.

717
01:30:02.327 --> 01:30:03.995
Can you read?

718
01:30:05.038 --> 01:30:06.789
- Yes.
- I can't.


719
01:30:07.499 --> 01:30:10.126
Look around if you like.

720
01:30:20.679 --> 01:30:23.681
But you won't find any missing persons
among those papers.


721
01:30:23.849 --> 01:30:26.851
On the contrary.
That's where they go missing.


722
01:30:39.322 --> 01:30:41.657
Are you in pain, my brother?

723
01:30:42.534 --> 01:30:44.493
I lost Euridice.

724
01:30:47.873 --> 01:30:51.709
It's as if she were burning
inside my heart.


725
01:30:52.085 --> 01:30:55.212
Keep calling to her.
She'll come.


726
01:30:56.298 --> 01:30:58.215
I've been calling to her.

727
01:30:59.009 --> 01:31:01.844
Your voice alone
isn't strong enough,


728
01:31:02.512 --> 01:31:06.390
and these papers
can't answer you back.


729
01:31:06.725 --> 01:31:09.727
You think these papers
care about anybody?


730
01:31:12.397 --> 01:31:15.357
Come, my brother.
I know where to take you.


731
01:31:16.818 --> 01:31:18.277
Let's go.

732
01:31:19.071 --> 01:31:21.489
Besides,
whether I sweep or not,


733
01:31:21.615 --> 01:31:24.033
the paper keeps piling up.

734
01:32:04.616 --> 01:32:05.950
Come, Orfeu.

735
01:32:09.496 --> 01:32:10.496
Quiet!

736
01:32:10.664 --> 01:32:12.790
Calm down, Cerberus.

737
01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:14.792
Calm down, Cerberus.

738
01:35:56.890 --> 01:36:00.642
That's right.
She received the spirit.


739
01:37:05.041 --> 01:37:07.584
Call to her.
Sing, Orfeu.


740
01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.937
Sing, Orfeu.

741
01:37:27.439 --> 01:37:29.857
Go on. Sing.

742
01:38:17.238 --> 01:38:20.407
No, you mustn't
look back, Orfeu,


743
01:38:20.533 --> 01:38:22.618
or you'll never see me again.

744
01:38:22.744 --> 01:38:24.453
Where are you, Euridice?

745
01:38:24.621 --> 01:38:27.289
I'm getting closer, Orfeu.

746
01:38:27.582 --> 01:38:31.668
Do you love me enough
to hear my voice but not see me?


747
01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:35.839
I love you, Euridice,
but I want to see you.


748
01:38:35.965 --> 01:38:37.841
My arms are empty.

749
01:38:37.967 --> 01:38:41.011
I want to see you
and hold you close -


750
01:38:41.137 --> 01:38:44.681
No! You'll lose me forever,
Orfeu.


751
01:38:45.934 --> 01:38:48.685
You're not there.
You're tricking me!


752
01:38:50.688 --> 01:38:52.397
I want to see you!

753
01:38:52.857 --> 01:38:55.025
Orfeu, you're killing me.

754
01:38:55.443 --> 01:38:58.028
Farewell, Orfeu.
You'll never see me again.


755
01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.365
Why did you lie to me?

756
01:39:01.824 --> 01:39:04.076
You lied to me!
- Calm down, Orfeu.


757
01:39:04.244 --> 01:39:06.245
Don't leave!

758
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:46.785
Hermes, that's him!

759
01:39:58.089 --> 01:40:01.341
Orfeu, it's me.

760
01:40:02.802 --> 01:40:04.720
Hermes is here too.

761
01:40:05.763 --> 01:40:08.265
I have nothing left to live for.

762
01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:11.643
I'm poorer
than the poorest of black men.


763
01:40:11.769 --> 01:40:13.604
Beg for mercy, my son.

764
01:40:13.730 --> 01:40:15.564
We're all poor,

765
01:40:15.690 --> 01:40:20.152
and the only words left for us
are those of the poor man:


766
01:40:20.361 --> 01:40:22.154
Thank you.

767
01:40:29.162 --> 01:40:31.580
I beg for your mercy, Hermes.

768
01:40:31.831 --> 01:40:34.875
All I can offer you
is man's mercy.


769
01:40:36.961 --> 01:40:38.462
Here.

770
01:40:41.049 --> 01:40:43.634
I've done
all that had to be done.


771
01:40:43.801 --> 01:40:48.055
I think you'll find
true mercy there.


772
01:40:54.812 --> 01:40:56.146
Thank you, Hermes.

773
01:40:57.148 --> 01:40:58.857
No, my son.

774
01:40:59.025 --> 01:41:01.652
Save your thanks for Euridice.

775
01:41:06.407 --> 01:41:07.991
Let's see.

776
01:41:10.536 --> 01:41:12.996
Are you going
to take the body?


777
01:41:13.247 --> 01:41:15.165
Because if not -

778
01:41:17.335 --> 01:41:18.877
Very well.

779
01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:20.712
Come with me.

780
01:41:29.222 --> 01:41:31.306
Because if you don't want to,

781
01:41:31.474 --> 01:41:37.604
another cadaver is always of use
to doctors and scientists.


782
01:41:37.814 --> 01:41:41.400
Works out cheaper
for you too.


783
01:41:43.695 --> 01:41:49.032
I only ask
because I'm required to.


784
01:41:49.242 --> 01:41:52.494
And the truth is,

785
01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:54.705
once you're here...

786
01:41:59.502 --> 01:42:01.253
Carnival is over.

787
01:42:01.421 --> 01:42:03.630
There's nothing anyone can do.

788
01:42:05.967 --> 01:42:07.926
Would you like to identify her?

789
01:42:08.553 --> 01:42:11.722
Careful. You'll catch a cold
dressed like that.


790
01:42:12.598 --> 01:42:14.891
Death is cheap here, eh?

791
01:42:15.351 --> 01:42:18.186
Careful.
You're shaking all over.


792
01:42:18.563 --> 01:42:21.273
The same thing happens to me.

793
01:42:22.066 --> 01:42:23.942
It's no use being careful.

794
01:42:24.277 --> 01:42:26.945
I have a cold year-round.

795
01:43:11.073 --> 01:43:13.116
Everything's beautiful, Euridice.

796
01:43:13.785 --> 01:43:18.371
My heart's like a bird whose thirst
is quenched by a single dewdrop.


797
01:43:19.415 --> 01:43:21.291
Thank you, Euridice.

798
01:43:21.834 --> 01:43:24.336
Thank you for this new day.

799
01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:43.480
It's you who's carrying me.

800
01:43:44.148 --> 01:43:47.692
I rest in your arms
like a sleeping child,


801
01:43:48.486 --> 01:43:51.321
and from the sweet breath
in your bosom,


802
01:43:51.614 --> 01:43:55.575
I know you'll take me
where I must go.


803
01:44:07.171 --> 01:44:09.172
Thank you, Euridice.

804
01:44:09.423 --> 01:44:12.843
The path you've chosen
is laden with flowers.


805
01:44:14.178 --> 01:44:17.681
The sun is rising
to welcome us, my love.


806
01:44:21.727 --> 01:44:23.812
Sing, Euridice.

807
01:44:26.065 --> 01:44:31.194
The happiness of the poor

808
01:44:31.863 --> 01:44:35.824
Is like the great illusion of Carnival

809
01:44:37.368 --> 01:44:43.206
We work all year long

810
01:44:53.676 --> 01:44:55.385
You snake!

811
01:44:55.553 --> 01:44:57.095
I'll kill you!

812
01:44:57.263 --> 01:45:01.016
I'll grind you to dust!

813
01:45:01.267 --> 01:45:03.101
I'll kill you both!

814
01:45:37.762 --> 01:45:38.136
Zeca!

815
01:45:38.137 --> 01:45:39.179
Zeca!

816
01:45:42.183 --> 01:45:44.392
Hurry!

817
01:45:45.353 --> 01:45:48.021
Play and make the sun rise!
- I can't.


818
01:45:48.147 --> 01:45:49.731
- Sure you can.
- I don't know if I can.


819
01:45:49.899 --> 01:45:51.858
You can.
Make something up.


820
01:45:56.447 --> 01:45:58.615
- Come on, play.
- I don't know how.


821
01:45:58.783 --> 01:46:00.951
Yes, you do. Come on.

822
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:23.098
He plays well, doesn't he?
What are you looking at?


823
01:46:23.224 --> 01:46:26.351
Shut up.
He's making the sun rise.


824
01:46:38.739 --> 01:46:42.492
He made the sun rise.

825
01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:44.995
Wow. Just like Orfeu.

826
01:46:45.287 --> 01:46:47.998
Now you're Orfeu.

827
01:46:48.457 --> 01:46:51.001
Yes, you are.
Take this flower.


828
01:46:51.252 --> 01:46:54.004
Play a song for me.

829
01:47:13.024 --> 01:47:14.524
Come on!
