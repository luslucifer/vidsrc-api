00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:04.085
<i>How did it come to this?</i>

2
00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:11.533
<i>It's been five years already.</i>

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.940
<i>The storm has passed,
but I'm stuck in its wake.</i>


4
00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:30.445
<i>Everything's gone...</i>

5
00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:34.122
<i>and I'm still here.</i>

6
00:04:18.348 --> 00:04:20.375
<i>If you hear
this, there is hope.</i>


7
00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:23.178
<i>We have food, shelter
and supplies.</i>


8
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.880
<i>Our location is 22.27...</i>

9
00:05:00.824 --> 00:05:03.151
That's one. That's two.

10
00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:04.352
That's...

11
00:05:04.394 --> 00:05:06.221
three. All right.

12
00:05:06.263 --> 00:05:08.263
I need that.

13
00:05:11.434 --> 00:05:13.668
All right, now...

14
00:05:21.678 --> 00:05:25.580
Okay, that's 12.

15
00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:28.549
That's 8.

16
00:05:33.056 --> 00:05:35.884
Looks so dry.
When is it going to rain again?


17
00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:39.127
All right, so 12 and 8.

18
00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:19.994
Fish today or chicken?

19
00:06:20.036 --> 00:06:23.171
Oh, no, no, no.

20
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:30.778
What is that?

21
00:11:13.896 --> 00:11:15.763
Okay.

22
00:13:44.947 --> 00:13:46.974
Waste of time.
There's no one here.


23
00:13:47.016 --> 00:13:49.910
Maybe you're
just not looking hard enough.


24
00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:52.847
I know what I saw.

25
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.832
I thought I saw something.

26
00:14:22.452 --> 00:14:23.911
Well, cheers.

27
00:14:23.953 --> 00:14:27.081
And you can tell me how it is.
Is it good?


28
00:14:27.123 --> 00:14:29.717
- It's really good.
- This is, technically,


29
00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:31.986
our first meal as sisters.

30
00:14:32.028 --> 00:14:34.688
Does this count as a meal?

31
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.358
Mm, this can be the appetizer.

32
00:14:38.734 --> 00:14:40.968
What does it taste like?

33
00:14:41.637 --> 00:14:43.431
- Goodness.
- Goodness?


34
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.801
Should we take a picture?

35
00:16:56.572 --> 00:17:00.074
Give me something.
Give me something.


36
00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:03.811
What's in there?

37
00:19:44.273 --> 00:19:46.066
What's over there?

38
00:20:49.104 --> 00:20:50.464
Caught you!

39
00:20:56.912 --> 00:20:58.445
Ow!

40
00:22:18.394 --> 00:22:20.787
Ooh, I like this.

41
00:22:20.829 --> 00:22:24.524
Tsk, I thought we were shopping
for your sister's birthday?


42
00:22:24.566 --> 00:22:27.361
Half-sister. And I am.

43
00:22:27.403 --> 00:22:30.797
Doesn't mean I can't find
a couple nice things for me.


44
00:22:31.941 --> 00:22:33.300
- A couple?
- What?


45
00:22:33.342 --> 00:22:36.036
Didn't I say
we were gonna celebrate?


46
00:22:36.078 --> 00:22:39.646
Celebration time.

47
00:22:40.282 --> 00:22:43.577
Oh, here we go.
She'll like this.


48
00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:45.679
Hey, that's cute.

49
00:22:45.721 --> 00:22:48.622
It looks
just like your jacket...


50
00:22:49.391 --> 00:22:50.317
but cheaper.

51
00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:51.084
It's okay.

52
00:22:51.126 --> 00:22:53.253
That way,
she'll stop borrowing mine.


53
00:22:53.295 --> 00:22:54.988
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get this.


54
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.598
Hey, do you think
I need more denim in my life?


55
00:23:00.936 --> 00:23:02.062
- Basic L.A. energy.
- Heh, yeah.


56
00:23:02.104 --> 00:23:04.464
Oh, you're coming
to Tristan's party, right?


57
00:23:04.506 --> 00:23:07.100
Yes, you've only asked me
like 87 times.


58
00:23:07.142 --> 00:23:08.902
I know it's a big deal.
I'll be there.


59
00:23:08.944 --> 00:23:10.370
Okay, good.
I'm just making sure.


60
00:23:10.412 --> 00:23:14.441
- Do you think that...?
- No. He doesn't suspect anything.


61
00:23:14.483 --> 00:23:16.710
- And...?
- And, yes, he'll be surprised.


62
00:23:16.752 --> 00:23:18.312
Okay, good.

63
00:23:18.354 --> 00:23:21.481
Oh, oh, oh! I am staying
at yours that night.


64
00:23:21.523 --> 00:23:22.816
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

65
00:23:22.858 --> 00:23:25.352
You're still hiding
that you have a boyfriend?


66
00:23:25.394 --> 00:23:26.320
You're 24. Ugh!

67
00:23:26.362 --> 00:23:28.956
Come on, you know
how traditional my parents are.


68
00:23:28.998 --> 00:23:31.024
They would have a stroke
if they knew


69
00:23:31.066 --> 00:23:32.292
I was dating a non
-Chinese guy.

70
00:23:32.334 --> 00:23:34.394
You know what?
You need to just grow a pair.


71
00:23:34.436 --> 00:23:37.064
When I told my parents
I was gonna move out,


72
00:23:37.106 --> 00:23:38.231
they just accepted it.

73
00:23:38.273 --> 00:23:39.399
I think about that a lot.

74
00:23:39.441 --> 00:23:42.336
Moving in with Tristan,
having my own space...


75
00:23:42.378 --> 00:23:44.271
- Yeah.
- ...but I can't.


76
00:23:44.313 --> 00:23:45.939
You know what?

77
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:47.274
You're an adult now.

78
00:23:47.316 --> 00:23:48.775
They're just gonna have to deal.

79
00:23:48.817 --> 00:23:51.311
Plus, it's not like
you can't afford it.


80
00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:53.880
Miss Associate
Merchandise Buyer!


81
00:23:55.057 --> 00:23:56.149
Okay, maybe you're right.

82
00:23:56.191 --> 00:23:57.584
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah.


83
00:23:57.626 --> 00:23:59.653
Oh!

84
00:24:00.562 --> 00:24:01.855
It's like she can hear us.

85
00:24:01.897 --> 00:24:04.491
- It's okay, let's go. It's fine.
- Leave me alone!


86
00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:07.734
I think I saw durian back there.

87
00:24:36.098 --> 00:24:37.964
What?

88
00:27:02.377 --> 00:27:03.710
Hi.

89
00:28:21.056 --> 00:28:22.522
Hey!

90
00:29:57.719 --> 00:29:59.152
Hey.

91
00:29:59.821 --> 00:30:01.388
Here.

92
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.558
Wow, thank you.
Thank you, <i>jiejie.</i>


93
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.600
It's just like yours.

94
00:30:14.202 --> 00:30:15.862
- Oh...
- Now that you have your own,


95
00:30:15.904 --> 00:30:18.631
you won't have
to borrow mine all the time.


96
00:30:18.673 --> 00:30:20.440
Thanks.

97
00:30:28.683 --> 00:30:31.918
Huh? Wait, what?
Poh Poh's necklace?


98
00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:41.588
Yeah, but that's not the point.

99
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:45.058
It should go to the oldest
daughter. I'm the oldest.


100
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.483
You okay?

101
00:35:37.525 --> 00:35:39.392
Fine.

102
00:35:48.203 --> 00:35:51.738
- I'm Asha.
- Hmm?


103
00:35:56.578 --> 00:35:58.811
My name is Asha.

104
00:35:59.814 --> 00:36:01.414
Okay.

105
00:36:05.754 --> 00:36:07.680
You're scared.

106
00:36:07.722 --> 00:36:09.555
It's okay.

107
00:36:10.225 --> 00:36:12.685
It's okay to cry.

108
00:36:12.727 --> 00:36:14.794
I don't cry.

109
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.430
You don't?

110
00:36:17.966 --> 00:36:19.459
Wow.

111
00:36:19.501 --> 00:36:21.434
I cry a lot.

112
00:36:22.437 --> 00:36:24.070
Yeah?

113
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:29.108
Yeah.

114
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:34.614
Before, I cried every night.

115
00:36:35.683 --> 00:36:38.751
With so much snot.

116
00:36:46.528 --> 00:36:48.461
You miss family?

117
00:36:50.832 --> 00:36:52.558
Yeah.

118
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.260
<i>Ah Ma.</i>

119
00:36:54.302 --> 00:36:56.669
But I'll see her soon.

120
00:36:57.539 --> 00:36:59.265
You will?

121
00:36:59.307 --> 00:37:00.733
Yeah.

122
00:37:00.775 --> 00:37:02.542
When I leave.

123
00:37:03.978 --> 00:37:06.839
- Oh.
- I'm gonna build a boat,


124
00:37:06.881 --> 00:37:10.076
and we're going to find her...

125
00:37:10.118 --> 00:37:13.686
and go far away from here.

126
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.690
Okay.

127
00:37:20.962 --> 00:37:23.462
My name's Yuen Hei.

128
00:37:24.165 --> 00:37:26.933
But people call me Hei Hei.

129
00:37:34.576 --> 00:37:36.809
Night, Hei Hei.

130
00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:01.400
Wait!

131
00:38:21.155 --> 00:38:23.115
No! No! No, no!

132
00:38:23.157 --> 00:38:25.925
No, no, no, no! No!

133
00:38:26.594 --> 00:38:28.087
Oh! No!

134
00:38:28.129 --> 00:38:30.523
That tape, it was...

135
00:38:30.565 --> 00:38:31.490
Oh.

136
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.139
Okay.

137
00:38:53.221 --> 00:38:55.054
Excuse me.

138
00:39:08.102 --> 00:39:10.803
Don't play with everything.

139
00:39:12.874 --> 00:39:15.201
Okay.
Since you're gonna be here,


140
00:39:15.243 --> 00:39:17.270
we're gonna have rules, okay?

141
00:39:17.312 --> 00:39:19.372
First, don't touch my stuff.

142
00:39:19.414 --> 00:39:22.408
Second, don't slam any doors
or make any loud noises.


143
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.011
Sound travels,
people are always listening.


144
00:39:25.053 --> 00:39:27.313
They are not as nice as me.

145
00:39:27.355 --> 00:39:30.323
- Pretty.
- Hey, are you listening?


146
00:39:36.397 --> 00:39:38.731
That was pretty cool.

147
00:40:19.407 --> 00:40:21.273
What?

148
00:40:23.511 --> 00:40:25.478
Hei Hei.

149
00:40:37.358 --> 00:40:39.251
That little thief. I'm gonna...

150
00:40:48.636 --> 00:40:51.370
I found food!

151
00:41:16.998 --> 00:41:19.331
Get it out of here!

152
00:41:52.834 --> 00:41:55.995
What do you do
if the bad men come?


153
00:41:56.037 --> 00:41:57.963
- What?
- The bad men.


154
00:41:58.005 --> 00:42:00.506
What do you do if they come?

155
00:42:01.742 --> 00:42:05.978
I have a hiding place.

156
00:42:06.747 --> 00:42:09.115
Can I hide there too?

157
00:42:09.717 --> 00:42:11.917
Weren't you leaving?

158
00:42:13.988 --> 00:42:15.855
You can come.

159
00:42:17.592 --> 00:42:19.992
No. I won't.

160
00:42:20.862 --> 00:42:22.495
Why not?

161
00:42:23.965 --> 00:42:25.998
This is my home.

162
00:42:26.567 --> 00:42:27.693
And plus, there's no point.

163
00:42:27.735 --> 00:42:30.429
There's nothing
out there anyway.


164
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:32.271
Nothing?

165
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.308
No. Not really.

166
00:42:37.044 --> 00:42:41.147
Anyway, let's deal
with these tangles.


167
00:42:44.452 --> 00:42:45.851
Here.

168
00:42:47.321 --> 00:42:50.816
You have a couple of tricks
up your sleeve, huh?


169
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.895
<i>Ah Ma,</i> she taught me.

170
00:43:01.135 --> 00:43:03.696
- Did you take my necklace?
- Huh?


171
00:43:03.738 --> 00:43:06.765
My necklace, you know,
the one I always wear.


172
00:43:06.807 --> 00:43:08.674
Did you take it?

173
00:43:10.044 --> 00:43:11.470
It's okay if you did.

174
00:43:11.512 --> 00:43:13.472
- No.
- Just be honest.


175
00:43:13.514 --> 00:43:15.881
- I won't be mad.
- No!


176
00:43:20.354 --> 00:43:22.655
You really didn't?

177
00:43:43.344 --> 00:43:45.010
Hei Hei?

178
00:43:51.185 --> 00:43:54.920
I'm not upset
if you took the necklace.


179
00:44:00.328 --> 00:44:03.322
I'm just not good at this
whole being with people thing.


180
00:44:03.364 --> 00:44:06.899
I'm just used to being alone.
It's just...


181
00:44:08.469 --> 00:44:10.135
easier.

182
00:44:11.339 --> 00:44:12.464
I mean, it's been so long.

183
00:44:12.506 --> 00:44:15.608
The last person
I talked to was...


184
00:44:20.848 --> 00:44:24.883
It's just been a long time...

185
00:44:25.319 --> 00:44:29.014
and I don't like people
touching my stuff, you know?


186
00:44:29.056 --> 00:44:31.423
It's not like I'm mad.

187
00:44:33.461 --> 00:44:36.789
Seriously? The silent treatment?
What do you want me to say?


188
00:44:36.831 --> 00:44:39.465
I'm sorry that I accused you.

189
00:44:50.544 --> 00:44:53.205
It's fine if you took it.

190
00:44:53.247 --> 00:44:57.483
You can tell me. 
I'm not upset.

191
00:44:59.687 --> 00:45:03.422
Okay, fine. I'm upset.
Are you happy now?


192
00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.707
Don't touch my stuff.

193
00:45:28.316 --> 00:45:31.016
What just happened?

194
00:45:54.442 --> 00:45:56.475
Huh? What the...?

195
00:45:57.011 --> 00:45:58.811
Where's the...?

196
00:46:10.091 --> 00:46:11.383
What the...?

197
00:46:19.567 --> 00:46:21.360
Is this okay?

198
00:46:21.402 --> 00:46:23.829
Is this okay, <i>jiejie?</i>

199
00:46:23.871 --> 00:46:25.597
I don't know. Ask Ma.

200
00:46:25.639 --> 00:46:28.867
I'm not allowed
to help with dumplings, right?


201
00:46:35.082 --> 00:46:37.543
Yeah,
the worst typhoon in history.


202
00:46:37.585 --> 00:46:39.445
- <i>Jiejie.</i>
- Yeah, I know.


203
00:46:39.487 --> 00:46:41.914
None of those places were built
like Hong Kong, but still.


204
00:46:41.956 --> 00:46:44.850
Ma, I'm on the phone.

205
00:46:44.892 --> 00:46:46.925
Phone later.

206
00:46:48.896 --> 00:46:51.657
I'll call you back.
The master beckons.


207
00:46:54.435 --> 00:46:56.295
I don't see
what the big deal is.


208
00:46:56.337 --> 00:46:57.596
You already have
yourself a slave.


209
00:46:57.638 --> 00:46:58.964
Don't talk like that.

210
00:46:59.006 --> 00:47:03.268
Why can't you be a good girl
like your sister?


211
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.808
<i>Asha? Asha? Asha?</i>

212
00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.676
<i>Asha!</i>

213
00:47:44.718 --> 00:47:45.911
Wake up.

214
00:47:45.953 --> 00:47:47.212
Wake up.

215
00:47:47.254 --> 00:47:50.789
It's okay. It's Hei Hei.
It's okay.


216
00:48:02.736 --> 00:48:04.096
The lights work.

217
00:48:04.138 --> 00:48:07.232
Only this one, but it's
always flickered like that.


218
00:48:07.274 --> 00:48:11.343
Plus, I don't trust electricity
around so much water.


219
00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:13.512
Come on.

220
00:48:14.682 --> 00:48:18.410
So we change the headlamps
in the stairwell much less


221
00:48:18.452 --> 00:48:21.413
because we don't
use them as much, right?


222
00:48:21.455 --> 00:48:23.689
Hey, are you listening?

223
00:48:24.525 --> 00:48:26.825
What's in that room?

224
00:48:27.995 --> 00:48:29.455
Which room?

225
00:48:29.497 --> 00:48:34.333
At the end of the corridor
with no handle.


226
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:38.770
Oh, yeah. That room.

227
00:48:40.407 --> 00:48:41.567
It...

228
00:48:41.609 --> 00:48:43.001
stinks.

229
00:48:43.043 --> 00:48:43.936
Oh.

230
00:48:43.978 --> 00:48:51.043
And when we let that smell out,
it's everywhere.


231
00:48:51.085 --> 00:48:53.852
Like warm farts.

232
00:49:00.227 --> 00:49:02.387
I don't care
what social media says.


233
00:49:02.429 --> 00:49:04.323
- <i>Massive waves...</i>
- This is different.


234
00:49:04.365 --> 00:49:07.025
<i>...have devastated Indonesia
and the Philippines...</i>


235
00:49:07.067 --> 00:49:12.431
<i>...Singapore has been
completely destroyed by floods.</i>


236
00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:18.103
<i>Ah Ma!</i> That was important!

237
00:49:18.145 --> 00:49:20.038
- Family's more important.
- Call you later.


238
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.741
But there are actual disasters

239
00:49:22.783 --> 00:49:26.245
that we should
<i>actually</i> be worried about.


240
00:49:26.287 --> 00:49:29.955
Eat first. Worry after.

241
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.755
You're working? I thought
you had that party... Ow!


242
00:50:13.534 --> 00:50:15.527
- You will go.
- It's okay.


243
00:50:15.569 --> 00:50:18.931
Your father too nice.

244
00:50:18.973 --> 00:50:21.567
We go as family.

245
00:50:21.609 --> 00:50:23.669
You're part of our family,
so you will go.


246
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:26.071
Maybe I don't wanna
be a part of this family.


247
00:50:26.113 --> 00:50:28.106
- <i>Jiejie.</i>
- Okay.


248
00:50:28.148 --> 00:50:29.908
Then you go find another family.

249
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:30.876
- Fine! I will.
- Go!


250
00:50:30.918 --> 00:50:32.945
This place is
like a prison anyway.


251
00:50:32.987 --> 00:50:34.413
<i>Jiejie. Jiejie.</i>

252
00:50:34.455 --> 00:50:36.648
- <i>Jiejie!</i> Don't go!
- Okay, go!


253
00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:38.550
Maybe I'll move in
with my boyfriend.


254
00:50:38.592 --> 00:50:40.919
Don't go!

255
00:50:40.961 --> 00:50:43.996
- It's okay. You'll be fine.
- MOTHER:


256
00:51:10.391 --> 00:51:11.984
<i>So anyone out there,</i>

257
00:51:12.026 --> 00:51:13.418
<i>if you hear this,
there is hope.</i>


258
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.554
<i>We have food, shelter
and supplies.</i>


259
00:51:15.596 --> 00:51:19.491
<i>Our location is 22.2759 degrees
north by 11...</i>


260
00:51:19.533 --> 00:51:22.361
Asha! Asha! Asha!

261
00:51:22.403 --> 00:51:24.696
I found help! Asha!

262
00:51:24.738 --> 00:51:25.697
I found help!

263
00:51:25.739 --> 00:51:27.673
Be quiet!

264
00:51:28.275 --> 00:51:30.669
- We just need a boat.
- No, we don't.


265
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:33.505
Why not?
They said they'll help us.


266
00:51:33.547 --> 00:51:35.040
No. We don't know that, okay?

267
00:51:35.082 --> 00:51:37.943
We don't know how long
it's gonna take to get there


268
00:51:37.985 --> 00:51:39.111
and how easy they are to find.

269
00:51:39.153 --> 00:51:41.813
Once we go back,
we can't come back, so no.


270
00:51:41.855 --> 00:51:44.249
- We're staying here.
- But if we try...


271
00:51:44.291 --> 00:51:45.784
Just stop it!

272
00:51:45.826 --> 00:51:47.359
Just...

273
00:51:48.128 --> 00:51:50.622
stop it, okay?

274
00:51:50.664 --> 00:51:52.958
Just forget it.

275
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.368
- You're a coward.
- Well, you're a thief.


276
00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.565
I didn't mean...

277
00:52:00.607 --> 00:52:02.000
I didn't
take your dumb necklace.


278
00:52:02.042 --> 00:52:04.436
You think you're so nice to me,
but you're not.


279
00:52:04.478 --> 00:52:09.681
You're just an angry, bitter,
scared person with no life.


280
00:52:29.903 --> 00:52:33.799
You can look if you want,
but don't touch.


281
00:52:33.841 --> 00:52:36.608
You're building a raft.

282
00:52:38.946 --> 00:52:43.181
Hey, now I have to fix that.

283
00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.879
You know this won't work.

284
00:52:47.921 --> 00:52:53.452
Well, I'd ask you to help me,
but I can't trust you.


285
00:52:53.494 --> 00:52:55.861
You might steal from me.

286
00:52:57.231 --> 00:53:00.866
Hei Hei, you know
you can't go out there.


287
00:53:05.706 --> 00:53:08.133
It's dangerous out there.
You'll never survive.


288
00:53:08.175 --> 00:53:10.902
There are things in the water,
the weather's unstable,


289
00:53:10.944 --> 00:53:13.478
you could get lost, starve or...

290
00:53:14.214 --> 00:53:15.680
worse.

291
00:53:16.183 --> 00:53:19.711
How do you know?
You don't even try.


292
00:53:19.753 --> 00:53:22.654
Anyways, I have protection.

293
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:25.050
What the...?

294
00:53:25.092 --> 00:53:26.718
Where did you get this?

295
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.294
I found that. It's mine.

296
00:53:29.897 --> 00:53:32.891
This is not a toy, okay?

297
00:53:32.933 --> 00:53:35.927
If this flare gun goes off,
they will hear us, find us,


298
00:53:35.969 --> 00:53:39.304
and then it's game over.
Do you understand?


299
00:53:49.016 --> 00:53:53.618
I'm sorry, but you don't
know what's out there.


300
00:53:54.955 --> 00:53:56.588
I do.

301
00:54:01.562 --> 00:54:04.322
I tried to find help...

302
00:54:04.364 --> 00:54:05.864
before.

303
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:10.035
It was bad, Hei Hei.

304
00:54:10.671 --> 00:54:12.898
Very bad.

305
00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:15.333
But it's not safe here too.

306
00:54:15.375 --> 00:54:17.369
Why do you say that?

307
00:54:17.411 --> 00:54:18.503
They'll find us.

308
00:54:18.545 --> 00:54:20.338
- Who will?
- The bad men.


309
00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.441
You talk about them
all the time.


310
00:54:23.483 --> 00:54:25.550
Even in your sleep.

311
00:54:26.153 --> 00:54:29.014
Well, now I have you here

312
00:54:29.056 --> 00:54:32.484
to keep us hidden
and safe, right?


313
00:54:32.526 --> 00:54:33.992
Yeah.

314
00:54:34.795 --> 00:54:35.687
Okay. Clean all this up

315
00:54:35.729 --> 00:54:38.023
and put it back
where you found it, okay?


316
00:54:38.065 --> 00:54:40.492
Okay. Can I have the gun?

317
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:43.835
Nice try.

318
00:54:50.377 --> 00:54:52.237
- <i>Jiejie!</i>
- What are you doing? Go back in.


319
00:54:52.279 --> 00:54:55.373
Please, <i>jiejie!</i>
Please don't go.


320
00:54:55.415 --> 00:54:56.708
I can't go back.

321
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.411
I can't go back to that prison.

322
00:54:59.453 --> 00:55:01.279
I mean, I have
no space, no freedom.


323
00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:04.282
Everyone's in my stuff.
Even you!


324
00:55:04.324 --> 00:55:08.727
Come on. That's my jacket.

325
00:55:09.963 --> 00:55:11.857
Look...

326
00:55:11.899 --> 00:55:15.727
I'll come home tomorrow
and talk to Pa and Ma...


327
00:55:15.769 --> 00:55:17.629
but I am moving out.

328
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:19.738
It's just time.

329
00:55:22.075 --> 00:55:24.369
But we can still hang out.

330
00:55:24.411 --> 00:55:25.937
We can go get fries.

331
00:55:25.979 --> 00:55:28.807
Can we go now?

332
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:31.416
No. Nice try.

333
00:55:31.919 --> 00:55:34.152
Wanna help me get a taxi?

334
00:55:34.488 --> 00:55:37.082
Hey, you're not
wearing the necklace.


335
00:55:42.229 --> 00:55:44.389
- Hei Hei, wake up.
- Hm?


336
00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:46.431
I need your help.

337
00:55:59.579 --> 00:56:01.947
So much water.

338
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:06.651
We've got
a lot of work to do.


339
00:57:27.434 --> 00:57:29.034
Hmm?

340
00:57:54.861 --> 00:57:56.828
Um, Asha?

341
00:57:58.098 --> 00:57:58.890
What is it?

342
00:57:58.932 --> 00:58:02.560
I'm not sure
if you believe me.


343
00:58:02.602 --> 00:58:06.798
I'm not sure how to say this.

344
00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.667
- What is it?
- Well, first, I'm sorry


345
00:58:09.709 --> 00:58:12.637
how I talk about your necklace.

346
00:58:12.679 --> 00:58:15.947
- About wishing...
- It's okay.


347
00:58:16.683 --> 00:58:18.743
We were both...

348
00:58:18.785 --> 00:58:20.251
stupid.

349
00:58:21.188 --> 00:58:25.150
Anyway, I'm kind of glad
it's gone.


350
00:58:25.192 --> 00:58:26.491
Really?

351
00:58:27.327 --> 00:58:28.893
Yeah.

352
00:58:29.596 --> 00:58:31.262
I'm glad.

353
00:58:37.471 --> 00:58:38.770
Wow.

354
00:58:39.172 --> 00:58:42.367
- Looks good.
- Thanks.


355
00:58:42.409 --> 00:58:43.775
Hei Hei.

356
00:58:44.244 --> 00:58:46.845
- Thanks.
- Welcome.


357
00:58:47.614 --> 00:58:50.742
Shall I cook some noodles
to celebrate the rain?


358
00:58:51.618 --> 00:58:54.379
Yeah. I'll open a can of meat

359
00:58:54.421 --> 00:58:55.480
and pickled cabbage too.

360
00:58:55.522 --> 00:58:58.423
- Let's go nuts.
- Okay.


361
00:59:52.445 --> 00:59:54.412
Is that your sister?

362
01:00:00.353 --> 01:00:03.448
It's the only one
I have of us together.


363
01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:05.323
She's pretty.

364
01:00:07.394 --> 01:00:10.662
Yeah. She was.

365
01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:16.868
You don't talk about her
too much.


366
01:00:19.472 --> 01:00:22.006
What's there to talk about?

367
01:00:22.943 --> 01:00:24.676
She's gone.

368
01:00:25.845 --> 01:00:27.679
They're all gone.

369
01:00:28.248 --> 01:00:30.882
Yeah. Dead.

370
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:39.450
But, hey, we're not gone.

371
01:00:39.492 --> 01:00:41.352
We're still here, right?

372
01:00:41.394 --> 01:00:42.187
Yeah.

373
01:00:42.229 --> 01:00:44.923
- And we have each other.
- Mm-hm.


374
01:00:44.965 --> 01:00:46.291
And Grace.

375
01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:48.059
- Grace?
- Mm-hm.


376
01:00:48.101 --> 01:00:49.434
Grace.

377
01:00:51.438 --> 01:00:53.998
Right. And Grace.

378
01:00:55.141 --> 01:00:56.634
Let's eat the food.

379
01:00:56.676 --> 01:00:58.610
It's getting cold.

380
01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:05.410
- Wow. Three sausages each?
- Yep.


381
01:01:05.452 --> 01:01:07.579
What happened to rationing?

382
01:01:07.621 --> 01:01:08.813
I know.

383
01:01:08.855 --> 01:01:11.522
Well, yeah, it's a celebration.

384
01:02:36.776 --> 01:02:38.710
There you are.

385
01:02:44.951 --> 01:02:48.846
Well, the water's clean
and stored


386
01:02:48.888 --> 01:02:50.948
and done the laundry, and...

387
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:52.423
Hey.

388
01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.892
Look at that.

389
01:02:55.628 --> 01:02:57.855
What? The sky?

390
01:02:57.897 --> 01:03:00.164
It's a good one, huh?

391
01:03:01.468 --> 01:03:04.035
Yeah, I guess.

392
01:03:06.206 --> 01:03:07.165
Hey.

393
01:03:07.207 --> 01:03:09.634
Thank you for doing all that.

394
01:03:09.676 --> 01:03:12.537
Now I have something
to show you.


395
01:03:12.579 --> 01:03:13.638
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


396
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.247
Come on. We can eat later.

397
01:03:29.629 --> 01:03:31.362
A raft!

398
01:03:46.913 --> 01:03:50.608
So you're definitely
coming back tomorrow, right?


399
01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:52.343
Yeah. I promise.

400
01:03:52.385 --> 01:03:53.911
- Morning?
- Wai...


401
01:03:55.088 --> 01:03:57.588
Yeah. Okay.

402
01:03:58.057 --> 01:04:00.418
Oh, God, I'm never
gonna get a taxi here.


403
01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.094
Let's try over there. Come on.

404
01:04:09.602 --> 01:04:12.263
- I knew you'd take the jacket.
- What?


405
01:04:12.305 --> 01:04:13.531
I knew you'd take the jacket.

406
01:04:13.573 --> 01:04:15.466
I put something
in the pocket. Ow!


407
01:04:15.508 --> 01:04:17.068
Asshole!

408
01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:20.638
Oh, my God! Amy, run! Run!

409
01:05:05.291 --> 01:05:06.891
Hei Hei.

410
01:05:13.233 --> 01:05:15.533
- I didn't...
- I know.


411
01:05:17.337 --> 01:05:19.470
The catch was broken.

412
01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:25.943
I'm really sorry.

413
01:05:33.386 --> 01:05:34.852
Here.

414
01:05:36.422 --> 01:05:37.688
There.

415
01:05:40.793 --> 01:05:43.861
- Keep it safe for me?
- Okay.


416
01:05:44.998 --> 01:05:46.564
Thanks.

417
01:06:07.487 --> 01:06:09.854
- Hei Hei.
- Hm?


418
01:06:37.517 --> 01:06:39.243
I'm sorry.

419
01:06:39.285 --> 01:06:41.185
I'm so sorry.

420
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:47.218
Please, no one hear that.
Please, no one hear that.


421
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.088
Please! Please! Please!
No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.


422
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:54.799
I know, but, Hei Hei,
it's just not safe.


423
01:06:55.468 --> 01:06:56.827
Please, we can still do it.

424
01:06:56.869 --> 01:06:59.730
Hei Hei, we'll go,
but not right now, okay?


425
01:06:59.772 --> 01:07:01.265
We have to wait it out.

426
01:07:01.307 --> 01:07:03.841
Now come on, help me do this.

427
01:07:14.554 --> 01:07:16.721
Come on. Go over there.

428
01:07:40.279 --> 01:07:41.846
That's good.

429
01:07:42.682 --> 01:07:43.774
Come on.

430
01:07:43.816 --> 01:07:45.549
Let's go.

431
01:08:32.532 --> 01:08:34.392
Nothing.

432
01:08:55.621 --> 01:08:57.188
Hei Hei?

433
01:09:06.232 --> 01:09:07.798
Hei Hei?

434
01:09:09.869 --> 01:09:11.702
All clear.

435
01:09:15.408 --> 01:09:17.274
Nice hiding spot.

436
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:19.610
You hungry?

437
01:09:20.346 --> 01:09:22.246
Are you sure?

438
01:09:24.317 --> 01:09:27.478
Might be the last hot meal
you get for a while.


439
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.923
There's no room
to light a stove on the raft.


440
01:09:36.329 --> 01:09:38.229
We're going?

441
01:09:50.543 --> 01:09:52.536
There she is!

442
01:09:52.578 --> 01:09:53.571
I see her.

443
01:09:53.613 --> 01:09:56.207
Asha! Asha!

444
01:09:56.249 --> 01:09:59.143
Asha! Asha! Asha!

445
01:09:59.185 --> 01:10:00.518
Asha!

446
01:10:19.272 --> 01:10:21.205
Hey, get the bed!

447
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:24.475
Hurry! Get Grace. Come on.

448
01:10:25.178 --> 01:10:27.111
Hurry. Come on. Come on.

449
01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.186
Yeah. Okay.

450
01:10:42.228 --> 01:10:44.688
- No. No. Wait, you can fit.
- It's okay.


451
01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:46.490
No. You have to stay here,
okay?


452
01:10:46.532 --> 01:10:47.658
- No. No.
- It's okay.


453
01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.726
- No. No.
- No. It's okay.


454
01:10:48.768 --> 01:10:50.928
- You have to stay here.
- You can fit.


455
01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:52.396
No, no. It's okay.
No, it's okay.


456
01:10:52.438 --> 01:10:54.932
We are running out of time.
Stay here. It's okay.


457
01:10:54.974 --> 01:10:56.667
- I wanna go with you.
- No, it's okay.


458
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:58.636
- I'll find another spot.
- Don't leave me.


459
01:10:58.678 --> 01:11:01.839
Hei Hei, I'm not going
to leave you, okay?


460
01:11:01.881 --> 01:11:04.208
Before you, I had nothing.

461
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:05.176
I had nothing, okay?

462
01:11:05.218 --> 01:11:06.877
I didn't have
anything to live for,


463
01:11:06.919 --> 01:11:09.180
nothing to care about.
You changed that.


464
01:11:09.222 --> 01:11:11.415
Okay? You changed that.

465
01:11:11.457 --> 01:11:13.584
We're gonna find a new life
together, okay?


466
01:11:13.626 --> 01:11:16.620
I promise. When it's time,
I'm gonna come for you, okay?


467
01:11:16.662 --> 01:11:18.088
I'll come for you,
I promise. Okay?


468
01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:22.066
- But where are you hiding?
- I know the perfect place.


469
01:11:23.603 --> 01:11:27.398
Somewhere that smells
like warm farts, okay?


470
01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.034
- Okay? Okay?
- Promise?


471
01:11:30.076 --> 01:11:32.977
Okay? Be quiet, okay? Okay?

472
01:12:24.163 --> 01:12:25.890
- <i>Okay, go!</i>
- <i>I will!</i>


473
01:12:25.932 --> 01:12:28.532
- Jiejie!
- <i>Go!</i>


474
01:14:11.504 --> 01:14:14.271
Oh, my God, Amy! Go, go, go!

475
01:14:20.312 --> 01:14:24.448
Amy, come here! Go!
Go that way! Go that way!


476
01:14:26.085 --> 01:14:27.878
Come on, Amy!

477
01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.179
- Stay close to me!
- Wait!


478
01:14:29.221 --> 01:14:33.050
- Hurry! Amy, come on!
- Slow down! You're hurting me!


479
01:14:37.163 --> 01:14:38.522
Come on!

480
01:14:38.564 --> 01:14:40.124
Wait!

481
01:16:20.599 --> 01:16:22.526
- Slow down!
- Hurry up!


482
01:16:22.568 --> 01:16:26.130
Ow! You're hurting me!

483
01:16:26.172 --> 01:16:28.038
- Hey!
- Come on, Amy!


484
01:16:28.474 --> 01:16:30.000
Hurry up! Come on!

485
01:16:30.042 --> 01:16:33.177
- My ankle!
- Come on!


486
01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.875
- Come on! Let's go!
- Wait!


487
01:16:37.917 --> 01:16:39.983
- Wait for me.
- Stay with me!


488
01:16:40.986 --> 01:16:43.053
Wait! Wait!

489
01:16:44.423 --> 01:16:46.183
Amy, come on!

490
01:16:46.225 --> 01:16:51.321
Wait! Wait! Asha!

491
01:16:51.363 --> 01:16:53.997
Come on, Amy!

492
01:17:55.894 --> 01:17:57.287
She's in there.

493
01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:13.437
Get up!

494
01:18:13.479 --> 01:18:15.572
Get up!

495
01:18:59.224 --> 01:19:01.291
Hei Hei! Oh!

496
01:19:18.344 --> 01:19:22.079
What are we gonna do with you?

497
01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:29.813
You can move if you like.

498
01:19:29.855 --> 01:19:32.316
I like it
when they wriggle a little.


499
01:19:33.525 --> 01:19:35.619
No! No!

500
01:19:46.071 --> 01:19:47.537
Shit.

501
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.266
It's all right.

502
01:19:49.308 --> 01:19:52.576
We've got plenty of time
for that later.


503
01:20:37.489 --> 01:20:39.249
Stupid bitch!

504
01:22:10.482 --> 01:22:12.048
It's okay.

505
01:22:13.785 --> 01:22:16.186
I'm not gonna hurt you.

506
01:22:16.855 --> 01:22:18.221
Whoa!

507
01:22:52.758 --> 01:22:55.285
<i>If you hear
this, there is hope.</i>


508
01:22:55.327 --> 01:22:57.621
<i>We have food, shelter
and supplies.</i>


509
01:22:57.663 --> 01:23:00.924
<i>Our location is

510
01:23:00.966 --> 01:23:03.193
<i>by 114.1455 degrees east.</i>

511
01:23:03.235 --> 01:23:05.529
- <i>There is hope.</i>
- All right, where are you?


512
01:26:12.991 --> 01:26:14.290
No!

513
01:26:14.659 --> 01:26:17.794
No! No!

514
01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:20.497
No!

515
01:26:23.401 --> 01:26:25.735
Please don't leave me.

516
01:26:26.972 --> 01:26:29.739
Please! Please!

517
01:26:30.342 --> 01:26:32.435
No!

518
01:26:33.979 --> 01:26:36.412
No!

519
01:27:11.016 --> 01:27:13.449
Shit!

520
01:28:28.326 --> 01:28:29.859
Okay.

521
01:28:36.935 --> 01:28:39.535
Why'd you save me?

522
01:28:41.673 --> 01:28:42.966
Because I get it.

523
01:28:43.008 --> 01:28:47.911
It's hard to make good choices
with only bad options.


524
01:29:22.681 --> 01:29:23.873
Want some?

525
01:29:31.389 --> 01:29:33.549
<i>If you hear this,
there is hope.</i>


526
01:29:33.591 --> 01:29:35.718
<i>We have food, shelter
and supplies.</i>


527
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.355
<i>Our location is

528
01:29:39.397 --> 01:29:42.492

529
01:29:42.534 --> 01:29:43.760
<i>There is hope.</i>
