00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.983
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.483
Someone's gotta talk to those two.

3
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.847
- Not gonna be me.
- It's too much, right?


4
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.792
You may judge, but I have
to say, I think their love is beautiful.


5
00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:10.900
What is it?

6
00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:13.823
- You're such a creep.
- What, for accepting them?


7
00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:15.525
Handsy old couple.

8
00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:18.608
Just going at it right in the street.

9
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.816
Like, full-on make-out session.

10
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.066
All right, all right,
get it out of your systems.


11
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.650
Ooh!

12
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.150
Okay,
guess we'll give you some privacy.


13
00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:36.900
- I actually like that.
- Yeah, you do?


14
00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:38.525
- Hey, don't!
- Okay.


15
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.858
Say hi to your parents, okay.

16
00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:47.358
Well, well, well.

17
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:48.275
I'll do that.

18
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.501
- Tell us everything.
- Those lovebirds.


19
00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:52.900
- Let's get out of here.
- Shut up.


20
00:01:52.983 --> 00:01:55.650
- Was it good?
- You're so annoying. Shut up.


21
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.066
Please just eat it. Come on.

22
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.316
You just ate it yesterday
and you liked it.


23
00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:15.025
Leon. Leon, can you...

24
00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:21.733
It's just cheese.
You love cheese, don't you?


25
00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:24.691
No, no, no, it's cheese.
Just eat it. Eat the cheese, baby.


26
00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:28.275
See, Daddy loves it. 
He's eating a lot.

27
00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:34.983
No, Leon, just please eat it.

28
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:38.191
Mom, please don't leave the TV on.
I can't hear myself think.


29
00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:40.358
No, Leon, your dinosaurs can wait.

30
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.858
Just... We are eating breakfast right now.

31
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:45.066
- Can you play with them later? Okay?
- Oh.


32
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.983
Look who decided to get up.

33
00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:49.108
You get your beauty sleep?

34
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:51.900
For your information,
I got up early and worked.


35
00:02:51.983 --> 00:02:54.400
Great. How much studying did you get done?

36
00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.650
- Very funny.
- You want your ba-ba?


37
00:02:57.733 --> 00:02:59.525
Curious what I'm working on?

38
00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:01.650
Okay, only three more.

39
00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:03.108
Just three more pieces.

40
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.441
Yeah, sure I am.

41
00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:07.525
Hey, Jo, can you
pick up groceries tonight?


42
00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:09.316
I'm gonna be working late again.

43
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.983
Uh, yeah, I'll go after class.

44
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.650
Can you buy diapers
and milk when you go?

45
00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:17.608
Don't forget, we switched
to plant-based diapers and soymilk.


46
00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:20.816
- He needs both.
- He really needs both, Ma.


47
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.566
- Fine, yes.
- Thank you.


48
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.775
I don't like soup.

49
00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:29.108
- What's this?
- So you don't forget like last time.


50
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.108
What, am I being punished?

51
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:34.400
I'm just trying to save you a trip.

52
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.733
Okay, up you go.

53
00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.316
- Hey, love you.
- Bye.


54
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.775
Sixty-five more to go.

55
00:03:42.858 --> 00:03:44.608
- Peace out, everybody!
- Bye.


56
00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:45.608
Gonna eat you up!

57
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.275
- Later.
- Later, Jan.


58
00:03:47.358 --> 00:03:49.650
- Bye.
- Janek, your lunch!


59
00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:52.566
Janek!

60
00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:04.191
Well, look what I found.

61
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.025
Don't brake so hard. 
You want me to vomit?

62
00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:20.316
I could switch places with you.

63
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:23.775
Why? That one wasn't my fault.

64
00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:34.525
Oh, don't start sulking.

65
00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:39.900
I'll get you to school safe and sound.
We'll get some coffee in your system.


66
00:04:39.983 --> 00:04:41.441
Then you'll have some nice meetings,

67
00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:44.125
you'll come home to your family,
and your night will be wonderful.


68
00:04:47.108 --> 00:04:49.066
Thank you, Professor Positive.

69
00:05:14.275 --> 00:05:16.066
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


70
00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:20.858
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


71
00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:31.733
Morning.

72
00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:33.775
Hi.

73
00:05:35.608 --> 00:05:36.608
Morning.

74
00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:19.525
Chow time. Chow time.

75
00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:23.275
Chow time. Chow time.

76
00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:25.983
Chow time.

77
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.816
Chow time.

78
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.941
Hubi.

79
00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:36.400
"Everybody worships."

80
00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:39.900
"The only choice we get
is what to worship."


81
00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.941
- Worship.
- Worship.


82
00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:42.900
Nick.

83
00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:46.025
"If you worship money and things,

84
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:51.316
if they are where
you find all meaning in life,


85
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:54.441
then you will never have enough."

86
00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:57.441
"Never feel you have enough."

87
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.233
- "This is the truth."
- Truth.


88
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:03.233
Monkey.

89
00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.358
"On one level,

90
00:07:08.941 --> 00:07:12.150
we all know this stuff already."

91
00:07:13.775 --> 00:07:15.316
"As myths,

92
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.691
proverbs,

93
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.650
cliche... clich..."

94
00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:22.900
Clichés.

95
00:07:22.983 --> 00:07:24.108
Clichés.

96
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:25.316
Clichés.

97
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.941
Clichés?

98
00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:30.483
Could you stand up for a moment?

99
00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:39.191
Is she really
hugging her right now?


100
00:07:48.025 --> 00:07:51.525
You look ill.
I'll order a taxi for you, okay?


101
00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:55.608
I respect that.

102
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.733
- Bye.
- Bye.


103
00:08:00.816 --> 00:08:02.191
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.


104
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:12.066
- See ya.
- Bye.


105
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.025
HEY, JO

106
00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:20.191
WHO IS IT?

107
00:08:20.275 --> 00:08:22.233
YOU ARE FUCKED

108
00:08:31.441 --> 00:08:32.566
Come on in!

109
00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:43.441
Think you stirred it well enough?

110
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.608
Hmm.

111
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.441
Maciek.

112
00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:53.191
We need to talk about the pigeon problem.

113
00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:57.108
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

114
00:08:58.358 --> 00:09:00.900
Because of you,
I have a courtyard full of shit.


115
00:09:00.983 --> 00:09:03.608
The custodian cleans it,
and he's getting tired of it


116
00:09:06.191 --> 00:09:09.108
Sorry, but hasn't it
always been full of shit?


117
00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:10.733
Well, not anymore.

118
00:09:16.066 --> 00:09:17.566
Maciek, this is an order.

119
00:09:19.983 --> 00:09:23.025
Stop feeding the pigeons. Immediately.

120
00:09:28.775 --> 00:09:30.608
I've always hated the decor in here.

121
00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:43.858
You're gonna ruin your eyes.

122
00:09:44.525 --> 00:09:48.025
My students are on Facebook so much,
they can barely see the board these days.


123
00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:49.941
Mm-hmm.

124
00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:53.858
I say to them all the time, "You're kids,
go play in the grass or something."


125
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:55.275
But they're like junkies.

126
00:09:55.358 --> 00:09:57.733
They just can't stop
staring at those screens.


127
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.858
Sounds like you should stop teaching
livestock hygiene and start teaching PE.


128
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:03.400
- Should I?
- I don't think so.


129
00:10:03.483 --> 00:10:06.941
In the old days, you could just kick back
while the kids played with a ball.


130
00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:08.441
But there too coddled for that now.

131
00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:12.191
Speaking of, I heard
you hugged my kid in front of the class.


132
00:10:12.275 --> 00:10:13.275
Yes, I did.

133
00:10:15.483 --> 00:10:16.816
You doing okay?

134
00:10:18.358 --> 00:10:19.358
Yeah, fine.

135
00:10:20.275 --> 00:10:21.775
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.


136
00:10:23.316 --> 00:10:25.358
You're looking a little unhealthy.

137
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:27.358
How does one look healthy, Maciek?

138
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:32.358
You just need to get plenty of sleep,
cut down on your vices, and smile more.


139
00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:33.275
Hmm.

140
00:10:33.358 --> 00:10:34.566
That easy, huh?

141
00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:48.025
Just relax.

142
00:10:57.566 --> 00:10:59.233
Are you sensitive to sounds?

143
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:01.691
Yes.

144
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:06.150
Earaches?

145
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:09.941
Yeah. Sometimes.

146
00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:13.525
Any recent exposure to the herpes virus?

147
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.066
No, not that I'm aware of.

148
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.775
Mmm...

149
00:11:20.858 --> 00:11:22.816
Do you think it could be MS?

150
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.650
Where'd you get that idea?

151
00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:31.358
Ah... Doctor Google.

152
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.275
We'll do a CAT scan.

153
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.691
Mmm.

154
00:11:38.483 --> 00:11:42.941
Today's chow time
is sponsored by Krysia's Pastry Shop.


155
00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:47.108
For a limited time only, you can get
their "expresso espresso" special


156
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:49.483
with a chocolate sponge and cream pie.

157
00:11:50.441 --> 00:11:53.900
Only ten zlotys,
you'd have to be a birdbrain to miss it.


158
00:12:47.816 --> 00:12:49.733
- Okay, I'm out.
- Later.


159
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:51.525
- See ya.
- Bye, Monkey.


160
00:12:51.608 --> 00:12:53.733
- Same time next week?
- Of course.


161
00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:05.691
Listen... Your neighbors
have filed a complaint.


162
00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:08.608
They say that you've been
up here smoking pot.


163
00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:13.900
And getting naked.

164
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:29.566
Let's go.

165
00:14:36.983 --> 00:14:39.275
- Now watch carefully. Watch.
- Yeah?


166
00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:41.858
Watch this footwork.
Not a single dance lesson in my life.


167
00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:43.233
MISTER NYSA

168
00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.066
Hey, what are you doing there?

169
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.025
Hey! No rolling when I'm rolling.

170
00:15:23.608 --> 00:15:24.691
What?

171
00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:27.316
"No rolling when I'm rolling"?

172
00:15:27.941 --> 00:15:28.983
Give me that.

173
00:15:33.525 --> 00:15:37.775
Okay, Jo, if you were completely free
to do what you wanted with no limits,


174
00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:39.858
right now, where would you be?

175
00:15:39.941 --> 00:15:41.400
I'd be smoking a blunt,

176
00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:45.233
lying in front of a horny teacher
from an agricultural tech school.


177
00:15:45.316 --> 00:15:46.691
Wow.

178
00:15:47.483 --> 00:15:50.108
But what about in another life?

179
00:15:55.233 --> 00:15:57.108
My mother has Alzheimer's.

180
00:15:59.941 --> 00:16:03.816
My youngest son may not graduate.
My eldest can't handle being a father.


181
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.983
And my husband is falling apart.

182
00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:14.275
They need me and
I need all of them.

183
00:16:14.358 --> 00:16:16.108
So in a world without them?

184
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.775
I would have no one.

185
00:16:30.775 --> 00:16:32.900
Can you drink it all, please? Yeah?

186
00:16:32.983 --> 00:16:36.358
You just need to finish it
and then everyone will be so happy.


187
00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:37.858
Can you do that for Daddy?

188
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:40.566
All you gotta do
is drink a little bit more, okay?


189
00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:44.150
Young man, don't you dare
force that bottle on the child.


190
00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:45.316
You'll make him sick.

191
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.275
- Didn't I just tell you not to?
- Calm down.


192
00:16:48.358 --> 00:16:51.150
It has soup in it.
He'll get an upset tummy.


193
00:16:51.233 --> 00:16:53.400
What makes you think that his tummy hurts?

194
00:16:54.358 --> 00:16:57.941
Babies cry when they're tired.
He could also be teething


195
00:16:58.025 --> 00:16:59.858
My intuition tells me these things.

196
00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:03.816
Well, can your intuition
tell you how to fix the sink?


197
00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:06.156
- I don't want it.
- How rude!


198
00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:09.233
I don't want more ba-ba.

199
00:17:10.733 --> 00:17:13.566
What did you do to my boy?
Let Grammy hold you.


200
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.483
- Hey, honey. Going for a run, be back.
- Come on, sweetheart. You're with Grammy.


201
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.608
So you've been in here dancing?

202
00:17:37.566 --> 00:17:39.941
Well that brat drives us all insane?

203
00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:42.733
Just try to help out more, all right?

204
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.483
Will you hold it still, please?

205
00:18:25.816 --> 00:18:28.233
- Janek!
- What? Jesus! Can't you and Adam do this?


206
00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:31.191
How about you and Adam do this,
and I'll go get a manicure.


207
00:18:31.275 --> 00:18:34.066
- You're better at this stuff than me.
- Anyone would be.


208
00:18:35.233 --> 00:18:37.150
All right, enough. 
I'll just do it.

209
00:18:52.358 --> 00:18:53.650
It wasn't me.

210
00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:05.066
No, no. It wasn't me.

211
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.691
- Mom, open the door.
- It was Witek.


212
00:19:07.775 --> 00:19:09.983
Or Adam.

213
00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.858
Mom, it doesn't matter who did it.

214
00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:14.941
Let's just get you
into a nice bath, okay? Mama?


215
00:19:15.025 --> 00:19:17.108
It wasn't me.

216
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:18.191
Mom.

217
00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:28.066
Mama.

218
00:19:40.691 --> 00:19:44.233
Why the hell can't they just leave
and go to your parents' old place?


219
00:19:46.316 --> 00:19:48.400
Because I need that place for tutoring.

220
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.608
With Adam...

221
00:19:55.691 --> 00:19:58.650
how long was it
until he slept through the night?


222
00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.316
Too long.

223
00:20:11.566 --> 00:20:14.150
Blood pressure rising,
or is it a heart attack?


224
00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:17.441
What if it's something serious?

225
00:20:24.066 --> 00:20:25.650
Oh, look at that.

226
00:20:27.191 --> 00:20:29.525
I didn't know that weed
cured hypochondria.


227
00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:32.066
Am I just a joke to you?

228
00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.025
Of course not.

229
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.858
I just don't see why you get
to have fun at my expense,


230
00:20:39.941 --> 00:20:42.691
but when I do the same,
you're so above it all.


231
00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:43.775
Hmm?

232
00:21:12.483 --> 00:21:13.900
What's this all about?

233
00:21:34.566 --> 00:21:38.108
- Who created this work of art?
- It was there when we got here.


234
00:21:38.191 --> 00:21:41.025
Looks like we're fucked.

235
00:21:41.108 --> 00:21:42.650
YOU ARE FUCKED

236
00:21:43.983 --> 00:21:46.816
Okay, fun's over.
You're all going to be late for class.


237
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.150
Let's go. On your way.

238
00:21:50.983 --> 00:21:52.733
You're totally fucked, dude.

239
00:21:52.816 --> 00:21:54.316
Yeah, you.

240
00:22:02.358 --> 00:22:05.775
Look, I understand that whoever
did this was making a joke of some kind.


241
00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:07.608
But this is no laughing matter.

242
00:22:08.108 --> 00:22:09.900
Vandalism is vandalism.

243
00:22:09.983 --> 00:22:12.816
We need to find a smart aleck
and make an example out of him


244
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.566
before other kids start
defacing school property as well.


245
00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.483
I already called the police.

246
00:22:17.983 --> 00:22:19.400
What did they say?

247
00:22:20.108 --> 00:22:23.775
Well, they say they're
sending 13 police cars.


248
00:22:26.316 --> 00:22:28.566
And the SWAT team too, apparently.

249
00:22:29.608 --> 00:22:33.275
I'll just talk to the custodians
and they'll get the graffiti cleaned up.


250
00:22:34.025 --> 00:22:36.316
That's not how
I would've handled this.


251
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.525
Is that right?

252
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:41.900
Well, you're more than welcome to run
for headmistress when my term's up, ma'am.


253
00:22:41.983 --> 00:22:45.025
- Since when am I "ma'am" to you?
- Since now.


254
00:22:45.108 --> 00:22:46.816
It's not that big of a deal.

255
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:50.608
Why all this agony over a prankster
we aren't even able to catch?


256
00:22:50.691 --> 00:22:52.816
Witek, you are double fucked!

257
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.525
You're the king of Instagram.

258
00:22:54.608 --> 00:22:57.316
It's only been half an hour
and you've already got over 300 likes.


259
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.691
Hmm.

260
00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:21.816
You need a lift?

261
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.650
We'll be fine.

262
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.941
You sure? Plenty of space.

263
00:23:32.525 --> 00:23:34.108
Trust me, it's under control.

264
00:23:39.525 --> 00:23:43.066
HEY, JO

265
00:23:49.108 --> 00:23:53.025
You look good in this picture.
Makes you kinda look badass.


266
00:23:53.733 --> 00:23:55.066
This funny to you?

267
00:23:56.275 --> 00:23:59.191
Sort of.
I mean, nothing bad happened.


268
00:24:00.275 --> 00:24:02.400
Nothing except that I became a meme.

269
00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:03.941
Wow.

270
00:24:05.316 --> 00:24:06.983
They won't even remember it tomorrow.

271
00:24:10.233 --> 00:24:11.441
Well, I will.

272
00:24:12.525 --> 00:24:13.566
Me too.

273
00:24:14.233 --> 00:24:15.400
Same here.

274
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.400
But you really shouldn't worry.

275
00:24:20.483 --> 00:24:23.733
If you're wondering who wins
the prize for Fuck-up of the Month,


276
00:24:23.816 --> 00:24:26.650
it's "Mister Nysa" here
and his little sash.


277
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:32.691
- The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
- "...the tree." Yeah, yeah, I know.


278
00:24:56.316 --> 00:24:58.816
- Was that on the car?
- Gotta go, Mom. It's green.


279
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.150
It's green.

280
00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:01.066
It's just...

281
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.150
Just an ad.

282
00:25:03.691 --> 00:25:06.066
- Hey, are you feeling all right?
- Yeah.


283
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.691
- Sure you don't want to switch?
- No, really, it's fine.


284
00:25:08.775 --> 00:25:10.025
No, it's not.

285
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:14.275
Witek.

286
00:25:18.108 --> 00:25:19.108
Get out.

287
00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:25.816
Buckle up.

288
00:25:29.608 --> 00:25:32.483
YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR SINS

289
00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:47.400
Just a sec.

290
00:26:06.816 --> 00:26:09.816
Mom, you don't need
to clean the windows. Just leave it.


291
00:26:19.858 --> 00:26:21.441
Oh, great. Now there's a draft.

292
00:26:21.525 --> 00:26:24.191
Just let her clean them a while.
She's not breaking anything.


293
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.358
Shall we eat?

294
00:26:29.858 --> 00:26:31.233
Sure, I'll go shopping.

295
00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:32.566
Witek!

296
00:27:39.441 --> 00:27:41.108
Why aren't you watching Mom?

297
00:27:41.733 --> 00:27:42.733
She's asleep.

298
00:27:44.608 --> 00:27:45.733
Look at that.

299
00:27:50.108 --> 00:27:51.108
It's oil.

300
00:27:51.691 --> 00:27:52.858
What kind of oil?

301
00:27:53.608 --> 00:27:54.608
Mmm.

302
00:27:55.358 --> 00:27:56.608
Canola, I think.

303
00:28:07.566 --> 00:28:09.525
Poor woman doesn't have long.

304
00:28:57.108 --> 00:28:58.275
Easy there.

305
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:01.108
Mommy?

306
00:29:01.691 --> 00:29:03.191
What are you doing here?

307
00:29:07.608 --> 00:29:10.566
Okay. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.


308
00:29:16.483 --> 00:29:17.775
A bucket.

309
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.358
Bucket!

310
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.316
All right. Let it out.

311
00:29:27.816 --> 00:29:30.251
You were supposed to keep him
out of trouble, so what is this?


312
00:29:30.275 --> 00:29:31.834
I'm not his babysitter.

313
00:29:31.858 --> 00:29:33.025
You're an adult and a father.

314
00:29:33.108 --> 00:29:35.348
- You need to be more careful.
- Come here.


315
00:29:37.525 --> 00:29:38.525
Now blow.

316
00:29:38.983 --> 00:29:40.400
- Mmm?
- Right now.


317
00:29:40.483 --> 00:29:42.983
No way. I'm 23 years old.
I'm not gonna blow.


318
00:29:43.066 --> 00:29:46.525
If you don't blow right this second,
I'm going to lose my fucking mind!


319
00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:49.566
I am exhausted, and you're out with
your stupid brother getting wasted?


320
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:53.400
- We're both just really tired. It's okay...
- Can we be normal for once in our lives?


321
00:29:53.483 --> 00:29:54.900
- Jesus!
- Will you calm down?


322
00:29:54.983 --> 00:29:57.150
He has food poisoning.

323
00:29:57.233 --> 00:29:59.233
This fucking house is poison!

324
00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:01.983
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Mmm.


325
00:30:03.983 --> 00:30:05.233
Mm-hmm.

326
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.566
Good morning.

327
00:32:01.983 --> 00:32:03.941
Mmm. Present perfect. Alex.

328
00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:08.233
Mmm. This has been water.

329
00:32:08.316 --> 00:32:10.108
Has this been water?

330
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.566
This hasn't been water.
Hasn't this been water?


331
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:16.858
Good. Nick?

332
00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.608
Future perfect in the past.

333
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:22.066
Mmm. This would have been water.

334
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.941
This wouldn't have been water.

335
00:32:27.441 --> 00:32:28.775
Headmaster wants you.

336
00:32:28.858 --> 00:32:30.483
Well, I'm in the middle of class.

337
00:32:31.191 --> 00:32:32.358
It's urgent.

338
00:32:34.525 --> 00:32:37.775
Uh, okay.
While I'm gone, please write down...


339
00:32:40.316 --> 00:32:41.775
past perfect,

340
00:32:43.775 --> 00:32:45.608
past perfect continuous,

341
00:32:46.441 --> 00:32:48.025
and future continuous.

342
00:32:49.316 --> 00:32:50.316
I'll be right back.

343
00:32:56.066 --> 00:32:57.233
Joanna.

344
00:33:01.608 --> 00:33:03.983
There's someone out there
who's trying to hurt us.


345
00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:14.816
YOUR WIFE IS DOING ILLEGAL THINGS
IN HER MOTHER'S APARTMENT


346
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.316
If someone knows you're tutoring
without paying taxes,


347
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.733
it's not going to be a good look for us
when word gets out.


348
00:33:27.108 --> 00:33:28.108
Who is it?

349
00:33:29.441 --> 00:33:30.900
The police are here early.

350
00:33:30.983 --> 00:33:34.025
They said they want to talk to you
about the details of the case.


351
00:33:34.108 --> 00:33:36.150
Any info you'd like me
to pass along for now?


352
00:33:36.233 --> 00:33:37.691
Tell them to wait, please.

353
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.733
Tomorrow we'll be running drug tests.

354
00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:47.650
So be ready.

355
00:33:47.733 --> 00:33:49.108
Why didn't you tell me?

356
00:33:51.691 --> 00:33:53.316
Do you tell me everything?

357
00:33:54.316 --> 00:33:57.650
You... are...

358
00:33:58.608 --> 00:33:59.775
fucked.

359
00:34:02.191 --> 00:34:03.191
So...

360
00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.733
You are fucked. Margaret.

361
00:34:05.816 --> 00:34:08.150
You are fucked.

362
00:34:09.066 --> 00:34:10.900
Alex, are you fucked?

363
00:34:10.983 --> 00:34:12.858
I don't know, am I fucked?

364
00:34:13.858 --> 00:34:16.233
- Kirby.
- You aren't fucked.


365
00:34:16.316 --> 00:34:18.733
You aren't fucked.

366
00:34:18.816 --> 00:34:20.275
We are fucked.

367
00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:22.525
We are fucked.

368
00:34:22.608 --> 00:34:24.858
Jan, are you fucked?

369
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.191
But we are fucked.

370
00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:31.066
We are fucked.

371
00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.275
Louder!

372
00:34:32.358 --> 00:34:34.691
- We are fucked!
- Whoo!


373
00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:36.483
We are fucked!

374
00:34:36.566 --> 00:34:39.108
- Whoo!
- We are fuck...


375
00:34:44.358 --> 00:34:47.316
I see you kept yourselves busy
while I wasn't here.


376
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.150
Monkey.

377
00:34:52.858 --> 00:34:55.525
I would like to invite you
to the front of the class.


378
00:35:05.983 --> 00:35:09.733
And please read out loud
the answers to the task I gave you.


379
00:35:11.566 --> 00:35:13.025
I didn't write anything.

380
00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:14.775
Why is that?

381
00:35:16.275 --> 00:35:17.566
I...

382
00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:20.233
got distracted.

383
00:35:20.316 --> 00:35:22.316
Hmm.

384
00:35:23.483 --> 00:35:25.608
So what do you think I should do?

385
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:28.066
Go on strike perhaps?

386
00:35:31.316 --> 00:35:32.691
What's so funny?

387
00:35:37.858 --> 00:35:39.858
Listen, soon you're gonna take your...

388
00:35:39.941 --> 00:35:40.941
Finals.

389
00:35:41.358 --> 00:35:42.858
We've been through this.

390
00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:45.483
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

391
00:35:48.941 --> 00:35:50.025
Okay.

392
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.525
Sit down, please.

393
00:35:54.316 --> 00:35:55.608
We'll continue.

394
00:36:10.733 --> 00:36:12.941
Your chariot awaits you, my lady.

395
00:36:13.025 --> 00:36:14.108
We can't.

396
00:36:15.025 --> 00:36:16.733
Come on, live a little.

397
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.525
You've got until the end
of this song to get down here.


398
00:36:24.941 --> 00:36:26.941
Hoo.

399
00:36:31.066 --> 00:36:35.650
Now, from Thursday to Saturday only,
you can get half of bamboo chairs.


400
00:36:35.733 --> 00:36:37.108
You kids hear that?

401
00:36:38.025 --> 00:36:41.191
So make sure you don't go
buying bamboo furniture anywhere else.


402
00:36:41.275 --> 00:36:44.025
They'll bamboozle ya.

403
00:36:44.108 --> 00:36:45.650
- What?
- Sorry.


404
00:36:45.733 --> 00:36:46.733
I'm sorry.

405
00:37:15.275 --> 00:37:16.275
Ow.

406
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:32.025
What are you doing?

407
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:37.150
You'll wake up the whole house.

408
00:37:51.316 --> 00:37:53.025
Look who's waking people now.

409
00:37:54.191 --> 00:37:56.691
You got the last word, Jo. You happy?

410
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:59.108
Are you? Because
you're free to leave if not.


411
00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:02.650
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- You don't know what I'd like. No idea.


412
00:38:02.733 --> 00:38:04.191
Let go, Joanna.

413
00:38:04.275 --> 00:38:05.650
You let go.

414
00:38:16.483 --> 00:38:21.066
<i>♪ The nightingale flies by moonlight ♪</i>

416
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.816
You want a little snake?

417
00:39:03.733 --> 00:39:06.316
You want two little snakes? Mr. Leon?

418
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.733
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you make me a big snake?


419
00:39:09.316 --> 00:39:11.316
You got three little ones,
let's put them together.


420
00:39:11.358 --> 00:39:13.238
Make sure
he doesn't swallow them.


421
00:39:13.275 --> 00:39:15.275
You have to watch,
stop him if he tries to eat one.


422
00:39:15.316 --> 00:39:17.608
- He's a toddler. He would choke.
- I'm watching, Karina.


423
00:39:18.483 --> 00:39:21.025
You're looking at him,
but I don't know if you're watching.


424
00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:22.775
You seem a little distracted.

425
00:39:23.608 --> 00:39:26.441
Oh, <i>I'm</i> distracted?
Have a pancake, sweetie.


426
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:28.316
Thank you.

427
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.525
Don't want that.

428
00:39:29.608 --> 00:39:31.691
Remember, it's not a real pancake, Leon.

429
00:39:31.775 --> 00:39:34.150
He knows, you don't have
to treat him like an idiot.


430
00:39:34.233 --> 00:39:35.233
You're not watching him.

431
00:39:35.316 --> 00:39:37.667
He's playing with Plasticine
and you took your eyes off him.


432
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:38.775
You can't do that.

433
00:39:38.858 --> 00:39:42.483
Children shouldn't be playing with
this stuff, especially not on the couch.


434
00:39:42.566 --> 00:39:43.608
Why is that?

435
00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:45.611
Because it's warm
and you're on a duvet.


436
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.650
If he presses it
into the fabric, it'll get stuck.


437
00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:50.533
- Where do you see a duvet?
- You're sitting on one right now.


438
00:39:50.566 --> 00:39:52.858
We are on a quilt.

439
00:39:52.941 --> 00:39:55.316
Well, good for you
for knowing so many words.


440
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.983
But to me, this is a duvet.

441
00:39:57.066 --> 00:39:59.900
And that right there is enough
for me to care about my kid


442
00:39:59.983 --> 00:40:02.525
pressing that crap
into the goddamn fabric.


443
00:40:02.608 --> 00:40:05.208
If you want to better vocabulary,
you should read more books.


444
00:40:05.233 --> 00:40:07.358
You read books about duvets, Jo?

445
00:40:15.441 --> 00:40:17.608
Who was that? Quilt factory?

446
00:40:17.691 --> 00:40:20.025
Come on, sweetie,
let's make the ball bigger.


447
00:40:20.525 --> 00:40:22.792
Don't just let him
mix it all together like that.


448
00:40:22.816 --> 00:40:25.358
Well, he's not
eating it, Karina. Let him play.


449
00:40:25.441 --> 00:40:27.108
Lollipop!

450
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:30.441
- He should be able to reuse it...
- Why do you even care? Reuse it?


451
00:40:30.525 --> 00:40:31.400
I bought it for him.

452
00:40:31.483 --> 00:40:33.525
Why are you holding it
over your grandson's head


453
00:40:33.608 --> 00:40:35.691
that you bought him
a little bit of Plasticine?


454
00:40:35.775 --> 00:40:39.316
That's crazy, Joanna. Do you know how much
Plasticine I bought you as a child?


455
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.608
- I never lorded it over you...
- That's not what I'm doing to him, Mom.


456
00:40:42.691 --> 00:40:45.709
- No? You said you bought it.
- Because it's a fact. I did do that.


457
00:40:45.733 --> 00:40:46.983
Well, why did you say that?

458
00:40:47.066 --> 00:40:49.900
- It wasn't to lord it over him.
- Take the Plasticine to his room.


459
00:40:49.983 --> 00:40:52.525
- Know what? You watch him.
- I hope you didn't break the bank.


460
00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:55.025
Grammy will buy you more, sweetheart.

461
00:41:03.108 --> 00:41:05.108
You're not the only one in this house!

462
00:41:11.816 --> 00:41:13.525
Since when do you smoke?

463
00:41:14.191 --> 00:41:15.566
Hey, Janek!

464
00:41:16.275 --> 00:41:19.483
You're not to smoke, especially
not in this house. Are you crazy?


465
00:41:19.566 --> 00:41:20.691
Janek!

466
00:41:21.566 --> 00:41:22.983
Answer me right now!

467
00:41:23.066 --> 00:41:24.441
Hey!

468
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.650
Where are you going?

469
00:41:39.025 --> 00:41:40.275
To get some air.

470
00:41:53.816 --> 00:41:55.191
You'll catch pneumonia.

Hello?

482
00:44:26.775 --> 00:44:29.400
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

483
00:44:29.483 --> 00:44:31.275

484

486
00:45:24.316 --> 00:45:26.191
Juice.

487
00:45:26.816 --> 00:45:27.858
Juice?

488
00:45:28.983 --> 00:45:31.441
You want juice? 
You got it, friend.

489
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:44.858
Juice here.

490
00:45:46.691 --> 00:45:48.025
Okay.

491
00:45:51.275 --> 00:45:52.983
You're still fucked, right?

492
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.108
Yeah, you are.

493
00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:14.858
Hey, Mom.

494
00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:21.941
Ooh la la. I'm loving
the boho vibe of this place.


495
00:46:22.858 --> 00:46:24.025
Very earthy smell.

496
00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:26.650
Does Dad know?

497
00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:33.733
What's this?

498
00:46:46.066 --> 00:46:47.358
I'm having an affair.

499
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.066
I'm sure you know what it'd do
to our family of this were to get out.


500
00:46:55.108 --> 00:46:57.483
So calling the police
is not an option here.


501
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.358
That's why I need your help.

502
00:47:09.983 --> 00:47:12.566
Why are you getting me
involved in all this, Mom?


503
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.025
Well, what would you
do if you were me?

504
00:47:23.233 --> 00:47:24.816
Fucking hell.

505
00:47:27.608 --> 00:47:29.858
I don't know.
Mom, I think you gotta tell him.


506
00:47:30.441 --> 00:47:31.816
I will, someday.

507
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.108
But right now, 
I'm asking you.

508
00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:42.941
For what?

509
00:47:43.025 --> 00:47:44.983
I need you
to find me someone in forensics


510
00:47:45.066 --> 00:47:47.358
who can look at
the fingerprints on this letter.


511
00:48:05.275 --> 00:48:06.816
Witek.

512
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.066
Witek.

513
00:48:09.816 --> 00:48:11.066
Wake up.

514
00:48:13.983 --> 00:48:15.025
Look at this.

515
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:18.066
It's here too.

516
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.025
Oh my God.

517
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.608
What happened?

518
00:48:37.025 --> 00:48:39.900
You know, I think
we should all go to a café tonight.


519
00:48:41.233 --> 00:48:44.191
Why? The coffee we
have at home is great.

520
00:48:44.275 --> 00:48:46.691
Bet Karina's gonna scream
when she sees you.


521
00:48:50.691 --> 00:48:51.816
Oh, shit.

522
00:48:54.816 --> 00:48:56.566
It's cool, she's not contagious.

523
00:48:57.858 --> 00:48:59.525
- Okay...
- We think.


524
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.066
Maybe this is a punishment.

525
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.775
What kind of punishment?

526
00:49:05.858 --> 00:49:07.608
- I want milk.
- Biblical.


527
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.483
Yeah, that's true, Mom.

528
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:12.775
Any sins you wanna talk about?

529
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.066
Come on, guys.

530
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.900
We should be positive here.

531
00:49:19.816 --> 00:49:22.941
This way Mom gets to do
her favorite thing and go see a doctor.


532
00:49:26.691 --> 00:49:28.900
That'll be fun, right? Yeah?

533
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.316
You doing all right, Joanna?

534
00:49:41.566 --> 00:49:44.066
Everything's going to be fine, darling.

535
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.608
She's always so anxious
about these things.


536
00:49:49.566 --> 00:49:51.483
Chow time.

537
00:49:52.816 --> 00:49:54.816
Chow time.

538
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:59.608
Chow time, chow time, chow time.

539
00:50:03.983 --> 00:50:06.441
Come on, come on, come on.

540
00:50:06.525 --> 00:50:08.900
Come on, come on, my pretties.

541
00:50:08.983 --> 00:50:10.983
Come on, come on.

542
00:50:11.691 --> 00:50:14.275
Chow time, chow time.

543
00:50:23.858 --> 00:50:25.691
Here you go.

544
00:50:25.775 --> 00:50:27.400
You guys like your chow?

545
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:30.525
Yeah? So hungry.

546
00:50:30.608 --> 00:50:32.983
That's good, that's good.

547
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:36.566
Bad boy.

548
00:50:39.525 --> 00:50:40.525
Mmm.

549
00:50:43.191 --> 00:50:46.358
Hey. You guys have some too. Eat up.

550
00:50:48.941 --> 00:50:50.025
Maciek.

551
00:50:50.525 --> 00:50:51.525
Chow time.

552
00:50:51.566 --> 00:50:52.733
Maciek!

553
00:50:54.233 --> 00:50:56.358
- What did I tell you?
- Chow time.


554
00:50:57.525 --> 00:50:59.858
I told you to stop this nonsense.

555
00:50:59.941 --> 00:51:01.650
You're gonna scare the birds.

556
00:51:01.733 --> 00:51:04.566
Chow time, chow time.

557
00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:07.233
Chow time. That's right.

558
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:09.400
Want a little more?

559
00:51:10.025 --> 00:51:11.650
Hey. Stop it.

560
00:51:11.733 --> 00:51:13.775
Don't...

561
00:51:16.608 --> 00:51:17.733
You happy now?

562
00:51:19.275 --> 00:51:20.858
Clean up this shit right now!

563
00:51:20.941 --> 00:51:23.233
You have until noon
before I call a cleaning company


564
00:51:23.316 --> 00:51:25.525
and deduct every cent
it costs from your pay.


565
00:52:21.025 --> 00:52:22.233
Come on, try it.

566
00:52:24.525 --> 00:52:27.400
My mother's fruit punch recipe
is three decades old.


567
00:52:30.483 --> 00:52:32.025
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


568
00:52:52.191 --> 00:52:53.650
- Uh, hi.
- Hey.


569
00:52:57.358 --> 00:52:59.191
- What's up?
- See ya.


570
00:53:11.233 --> 00:53:12.233
Oh.

571
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:17.108
Listen, I, uh...

572
00:53:18.358 --> 00:53:22.025
I got you this. Uh... It says
you can put it on your skin twice a day,


573
00:53:22.108 --> 00:53:25.025
so it should help out with everything.

574
00:53:25.108 --> 00:53:27.816
Uh, and this is an herbal tea.

575
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.066
- Hmm.
- Which is supposed to help you relax.


576
00:53:32.066 --> 00:53:35.525
I asked my friend to get some advice
from this Mongolian guy he goes to.


577
00:53:35.608 --> 00:53:39.275
Thanks for your concern, but I have
some of the best specialists in the city.


578
00:53:46.858 --> 00:53:48.525
What did your friend say, though?

579
00:53:49.775 --> 00:53:52.233
That... you worry a lot.

580
00:53:52.316 --> 00:53:55.816
And that he'll get you on
a treatment plan if you go to his office.


581
00:53:56.816 --> 00:53:58.400
Says you'll be cured.

582
00:53:58.983 --> 00:54:00.108
Mm-hmm.

583
00:55:42.775 --> 00:55:44.108
I love you, Jo.

584
00:55:46.733 --> 00:55:48.775
So please stop ignoring me.

585
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:54.400
Don't make a bigger fool
out of me than I am already.


586
00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:24.316
Expulsion is out of the question.
We're not here to destroy students' lives.


587
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.191
You have another suggestion?

588
00:56:26.275 --> 00:56:27.191
Calm down.

589
00:56:27.275 --> 00:56:28.941
Apart from the marijuana,

590
00:56:29.025 --> 00:56:32.066
are there any other drugs
our students tested positive for?


591
00:56:33.066 --> 00:56:36.108
Three students also had
mephedrone in their bloodstream.


592
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:43.358
Thank you, Officer.

593
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.191
Maciek, I'm sorry,
but your daughter is a problem


594
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:54.233
We're going to have to
expel all three of them.


595
00:56:54.316 --> 00:56:58.483
Or, they can transfer schools quietly
once the school year is over.


596
00:56:58.566 --> 00:57:01.650
Those are our options, really?
This is a bad decision.


597
00:57:02.316 --> 00:57:04.400
Why don't we wait
for your test results


598
00:57:04.483 --> 00:57:06.400
before we hear
your thoughts on the matter?


599
00:57:06.483 --> 00:57:07.816
I beg your pardon?

600
00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:11.900
Did you think we'd never find out
about your little pot smoking habit?


601
00:57:22.775 --> 00:57:24.066
So tragic.

602
00:57:37.608 --> 00:57:39.691
Why the fuck
didn't you defend me from her...


603
00:57:39.775 --> 00:57:42.483
No, no, no.
You don't get to blame me for this.


604
00:57:42.983 --> 00:57:44.858
These are serious allegations, Jo.

605
00:57:46.066 --> 00:57:48.358
And we both know that they're true.

606
00:57:49.233 --> 00:57:51.066
Such a politician, aren't you?

607
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:54.858
Your position's all that matters.

608
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:59.441
Congratulations, Headmaster.

609
00:59:15.608 --> 00:59:19.108
"There are these two young fish

610
00:59:20.483 --> 00:59:22.441
swimming along."

611
00:59:23.275 --> 00:59:26.358
"And they happen to meet an older fish

612
00:59:28.025 --> 00:59:30.608
who nods at them and says,

613
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.816
'Morning, boys.'

614
00:59:34.941 --> 00:59:36.400
'How's the water?'"

615
00:59:37.608 --> 00:59:41.566
"And the two young fish

616
00:59:42.983 --> 00:59:44.941
swim on for a bit."

617
00:59:46.733 --> 00:59:48.858
"And then, eventually,

618
00:59:49.733 --> 00:59:53.066
one of them looks over to the other,

619
00:59:54.275 --> 00:59:55.608
and goes...

620
00:59:59.566 --> 01:00:01.483
'What the hell is water?'"

621
01:00:20.108 --> 01:00:21.983
What the hell is with the spanking?

622
01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:30.066
Karina and I,
we made a bet the year before last.


623
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:31.275
Mm-hmm.

624
01:00:32.316 --> 01:00:35.650
I bet her you'd give us the old apartment
before the year was over.


625
01:00:36.691 --> 01:00:38.441
I owe her 100 spanks.

626
01:00:40.025 --> 01:00:42.316
Daddy, I wanna see Mommy.

627
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:46.400
I want Mommy.

628
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:52.816
And where is Karina now?

629
01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.775
I think she's off
with her girlfriends at a lake.


630
01:00:55.858 --> 01:00:57.108
What, you don't know?

631
01:00:57.191 --> 01:01:00.150
You mean you don't know
where the mother of your child is?


632
01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:02.941
Does Dad know where you are right now?

633
01:01:46.108 --> 01:01:48.316
You're young enough to be my daughter.

634
01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:51.775
But I'm not, am I?

635
01:02:20.358 --> 01:02:21.358
Adam.

636
01:02:40.816 --> 01:02:42.150
Well, fuck.

637
01:02:50.441 --> 01:02:51.816
- Oh, fuck!
- Let's go!


638
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.941
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

639
01:02:54.525 --> 01:02:55.525
Shh.

640
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.650
Go. Come on. Come on!

641
01:03:06.566 --> 01:03:07.900
- Shh.
- Jesus Christ.


642
01:03:10.191 --> 01:03:11.400
It's a plastic model.

643
01:03:12.275 --> 01:03:13.608
This is Maciek's room.

644
01:03:18.608 --> 01:03:21.858
Mom, how'd you know
where to find his keys?


645
01:03:21.941 --> 01:03:23.566
Don't ask stupid questions.

646
01:03:25.275 --> 01:03:26.275
Shh.

647
01:03:34.025 --> 01:03:35.233
He's gone.

648
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.816
Open the window, please.
Whatever that is smells horrible.


649
01:04:43.358 --> 01:04:44.941
You've been running a lot.

650
01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:50.150
Yeah, you've been quite
a busy woman yourself as of late.


651
01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:52.858
At your sons' expense.

652
01:04:53.525 --> 01:04:54.900
My mom's expense too.

653
01:05:00.233 --> 01:05:01.566
They'll be expelled.

654
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.150
Even Monkey.

655
01:05:08.858 --> 01:05:12.983
- You heard the way other teachers talk.
- Do you think I give a shit what they say?


656
01:05:13.566 --> 01:05:15.733
This is an about your ego, Joanna.

657
01:05:15.816 --> 01:05:18.066
- It's about the entire school.
- Really?


658
01:05:19.025 --> 01:05:20.025
My ego?

659
01:05:21.691 --> 01:05:25.233
- You got anything else you wanna say?
- Listen, I'm not trying to fight with you.


660
01:05:25.316 --> 01:05:27.150
Oh sure, you're not trying to fight.

661
01:05:27.233 --> 01:05:29.400
You woke up this morning
and told me that I stink.


662
01:05:29.483 --> 01:05:32.108
I'm sorry, all right.
I'll start the whole day over.


663
01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:38.441
Good morning, Joanna, my love.

664
01:05:40.441 --> 01:05:44.108
I'm so happy to
see you alive and well.

665
01:05:49.858 --> 01:05:51.650
And you smell beautiful.

666
01:05:52.608 --> 01:05:53.650
Thanks.

667
01:05:58.566 --> 01:06:00.316
- Story!
- Soup again?


668
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.400
Story! I want to read a story!

669
01:06:03.483 --> 01:06:04.816
I want to read a story!

670
01:06:05.566 --> 01:06:08.108
Please, I am begging you,
just give me a minute.


671
01:06:09.525 --> 01:06:10.983
Leon, calm down.

672
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:15.525
If you just give us the keys
to your parents' apartment, we'll be gone.


673
01:06:15.608 --> 01:06:17.608
This will all go away.

674
01:06:17.691 --> 01:06:19.358
Well, it's her decision.

675
01:06:22.608 --> 01:06:25.316
Why don't you
talk to them about why not, Jo?


676
01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:27.566
Yeah, Mom. Why not?

677
01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:38.691
Let me tell you something.
If you think a new apartment


678
01:06:38.775 --> 01:06:41.733
will solve the problem
behind that wall, then you're fools.


679
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:45.233
Now I'm gonna go calm
that little boy down in two minutes


680
01:06:45.316 --> 01:06:46.983
so you see what parenting looks like.

681
01:07:01.025 --> 01:07:02.608
Could you get some milk?

682
01:07:02.691 --> 01:07:03.691
Sure.

683
01:07:06.316 --> 01:07:08.775
Would you look at
that, just 29 left now.

684
01:07:09.691 --> 01:07:12.650
I wanna go play. I wanna go play.

685
01:07:13.608 --> 01:07:17.233
See those dark patches?
Those are dead brain tissue.


686
01:07:18.066 --> 01:07:20.775
And in six months,
they're going to double in size.


687
01:07:24.608 --> 01:07:25.983
What's your advice?

688
01:07:27.358 --> 01:07:29.650
You'll need to settle
your mother's affairs.


689
01:07:31.941 --> 01:07:35.691
It would be wise to start
planning ahead for the coming months.


690
01:07:44.983 --> 01:07:46.775
Joanna, you have latent tetany.

691
01:07:46.858 --> 01:07:49.525
It's a calcium deficiency,
so you might want to drink more milk


692
01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:51.316
Hmm.

693
01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:03.483
We are currently on the upper floor,

694
01:08:03.566 --> 01:08:05.983
which houses patients
who are still able to walk.


695
01:08:06.525 --> 01:08:10.233
There's an elevator, of course,
but if someone wants to use the stairs,


696
01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:12.316
that is obviously their choice.

697
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.150
We encourage all physical activity.

698
01:08:14.941 --> 01:08:19.316
So, if your mother takes walks
or does stretches, she can do that here.


699
01:08:21.608 --> 01:08:22.900
Right this way.

700
01:08:23.608 --> 01:08:25.983
This is the room
we've prepared for your mother.


701
01:08:26.066 --> 01:08:28.775
It's not a five-star hotel suite, I know.

702
01:08:28.858 --> 01:08:33.066
But it's been cleaned,
and I guarantee she'll be very happy here.


703
01:08:33.566 --> 01:08:37.150
Oh, I'll be happy?
Go fuck yourself, you bastard.


704
01:08:37.233 --> 01:08:39.441
- I hope you get Covid.
- Stop. Mom. Mom, stop.


705
01:08:39.525 --> 01:08:40.733
Son of a bitch.

706
01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:50.608
I can't believe that you're
just gonna leave grandma here.


707
01:08:53.775 --> 01:08:56.150
We'll see what you do
someday when it's me.


708
01:09:05.816 --> 01:09:08.316
No one puts their loved ones away
in the country.


709
01:09:09.566 --> 01:09:10.733
Oh, "the country"?

710
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.983
Well you don't live
in the country anymore, do you?


711
01:09:14.066 --> 01:09:15.786
- Why do you hate where I'm from?
- I don't.


712
01:09:15.816 --> 01:09:17.775
It just doesn't make you better than us.

713
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:38.733
Chow time. Chow time.

714
01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:43.025
- Chow time.
- Freak time. Freak time. Freak time.


715
01:09:43.108 --> 01:09:45.775
- Chow time.
- When is that dude gonna grow up?


716
01:09:45.858 --> 01:09:47.441
He's a teacher.

717
01:09:47.525 --> 01:09:48.816
How bad are you?

718
01:09:49.941 --> 01:09:52.025
Thank God he hasn't noticed it's us.

719
01:09:52.733 --> 01:09:53.983
How can you tell?

720
01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:56.733
He would've said something obnoxious.

721
01:10:00.566 --> 01:10:02.983
Don't speed, please. 
It's frightening.

722
01:10:07.066 --> 01:10:09.025
- Who's that?
- The bank.


723
01:10:11.233 --> 01:10:13.358
- Are you gonna it?
- I'm driving.


724
01:10:13.858 --> 01:10:15.483
Just pick it up, Mom.

725
01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:19.025
Joanna, stop the car.

726
01:10:23.441 --> 01:10:25.691
She's so self-righteous and stubborn.

727
01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:28.566
I like that about her.

728
01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:34.441
And about you.

729
01:11:40.483 --> 01:11:43.358
Let's go. Let's go.

730
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:44.858
Come on.

731
01:11:45.775 --> 01:11:47.775
One sec!

732
01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.816
Joanna, I know
this apartment means a lot to you,


733
01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:21.066
but could you please
kindly consider giving it to us?


734
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:25.358
Because it's very hard for Adam and I
to raise our child and a dog pile.


735
01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.150
Aren't you direct?

736
01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:37.108
You do realize you can always
rent a studio apartment, right?


737
01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:38.983
No need for all this extra space.

738
01:12:39.483 --> 01:12:41.608
You just need to
have room for two people.

739
01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.108
And a dog.

740
01:12:47.858 --> 01:12:49.983
Shit. Ow.

741
01:12:54.566 --> 01:12:56.733
Don't give me that look.
I won't tell Witek.


742
01:12:57.233 --> 01:12:58.608
I'm not that stupid.

743
01:12:59.566 --> 01:13:02.733
But I bet he knows some thing.
It's not hard to see.


744
01:13:10.983 --> 01:13:13.650
If your happiness depends
on other people's decisions,


745
01:13:13.733 --> 01:13:15.358
you will never be happy.

746
01:13:15.441 --> 01:13:17.941
That's all I have
to say about the matter.

747
01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:24.108
Let's go.

748
01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:26.650
'Kay.

749
01:13:29.566 --> 01:13:31.316
For fuck's sake!

750
01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:32.941
Go.

751
01:13:41.691 --> 01:13:43.233
Okay. It's okay.

752
01:13:52.275 --> 01:13:53.983
We can't go on like this.

753
01:14:09.608 --> 01:14:10.608
Come on.

754
01:15:01.275 --> 01:15:04.816
He says the fingerprints on the envelope
don't match the ones on the glass.


755
01:15:06.858 --> 01:15:09.441
Then maybe we'll have
to go in for another sting.


756
01:15:14.775 --> 01:15:16.400
Just get some rest, okay?

757
01:15:17.025 --> 01:15:19.525
- Or better yet, talk to Dad.
- Hmm.


758
01:15:21.358 --> 01:15:25.150
Any other terrible advice you want
to give me today, or are you done?


759
01:15:31.566 --> 01:15:33.108
God, you're ridiculous!

760
01:15:33.941 --> 01:15:35.358
You're ridiculous, Mom!

761
01:15:35.941 --> 01:15:38.775
You can't just pretend
to be grateful? Huh?


762
01:15:38.858 --> 01:15:41.733
Did you think for one second
about what I'm doing for you?


763
01:15:41.816 --> 01:15:44.441
I'm lying to my partner,
talking to private investigators,


764
01:15:44.525 --> 01:15:45.858
I broke into fucking school!

765
01:15:48.566 --> 01:15:50.608
For fuck's sake.

766
01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:02.983
Hey, hang in there, Jo.

767
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.400
Oh my God, there she is.

768
01:16:30.858 --> 01:16:36.150
ENGLISH CLASSROOM

769
01:17:18.608 --> 01:17:20.608
- Good morning, Headmaster.
- Good morning.


770
01:17:20.691 --> 01:17:21.983
Good morning.

771
01:17:22.066 --> 01:17:26.400
Żabnicka, I need you
to come down to my office with me.


772
01:17:29.525 --> 01:17:31.483
You're not going anywhere, Monkey.

773
01:17:32.608 --> 01:17:34.900
On what grounds
are you pulling her from my class?


774
01:17:36.108 --> 01:17:37.775
I'm the headmaster of this school,

775
01:17:37.858 --> 01:17:40.316
and everyone here is
required to do as I say.


776
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:44.983
If you expel this girl,
it will be my last day at this school.


777
01:17:53.608 --> 01:17:55.400
We'll talk after class, then.

778
01:18:03.483 --> 01:18:05.150
I'm not afraid of him.

779
01:18:20.483 --> 01:18:22.400
I'm not afraid of anyone.

780
01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:49.025
Pomegranate sounds good right now.

781
01:18:51.858 --> 01:18:53.191
I'll buy one for you.

782
01:19:24.775 --> 01:19:27.191
Do you happen to recognize
anyone in this video?


783
01:19:29.108 --> 01:19:30.108
No.

784
01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:40.733
I really don't care what you were
doing in the school at night.


785
01:19:42.108 --> 01:19:43.608
I'm not interested

786
01:19:44.816 --> 01:19:47.483
in why you had the keys
to Maciek's classroom.


787
01:19:48.066 --> 01:19:50.775
But if anyone sees this,
I can't defend you.


788
01:19:51.441 --> 01:19:53.941
You're going on sabbatical
for the rest of the year


789
01:19:55.858 --> 01:19:58.191
Maybe you're the one behind all of this.

790
01:20:00.775 --> 01:20:01.983
Go home, Joanna.

791
01:20:27.233 --> 01:20:28.066
Hello?

792
01:20:28.150 --> 01:20:30.917
<i>You will
find a link to a video in your inbox.</i>


793
01:20:30.941 --> 01:20:33.525
<i>If you do not show it
to your family this evening,</i>


794
01:20:33.608 --> 01:20:35.733
<i>the whole city will see it tomorrow.</i>

795
01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:49.941
<i>Okay, Jo, if you were completely free
to do what you wanted with no limits,</i>


796
01:20:50.025 --> 01:20:51.525
<i>right now, where would you be?</i>

797
01:20:54.691 --> 01:20:56.525
<i>I'd be smoking a blunt,</i>

798
01:20:58.441 --> 01:21:02.275
<i>lying in front of a horny teacher
from an agricultural tech school.</i>


799
01:21:04.608 --> 01:21:06.358
<i>Yes? Hello?</i>

800
01:21:07.566 --> 01:21:11.025
<i>Yeah, hi, I'm looking
for a man in a sexy sash.</i>


801
01:21:11.108 --> 01:21:13.691
<i>Could you please ask him
to take his pants off?</i>


802
01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:18.525
<i>I'm sorry, you're breaking up.
Could you repeat that?</i>


803
01:21:18.608 --> 01:21:21.691
<i>I said get up
and take off your pants.</i>


804
01:21:32.108 --> 01:21:34.650
<i>- Now what?
- Well...</i>


805
01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.566
You took a vow to love me.

806
01:21:56.691 --> 01:21:57.983
Honor me.

807
01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:00.191
Be faithful to me.

808
01:22:10.316 --> 01:22:12.108
I'm not gonna take this.

809
01:22:12.191 --> 01:22:14.191
I stood by your side for years.

810
01:22:14.275 --> 01:22:16.400
And I listened to your bullshit.

811
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:19.816
But I just can't anymore.

812
01:22:20.316 --> 01:22:24.275
The insecurities, the emotional blackmail,

813
01:22:24.358 --> 01:22:27.525
I'm tired of them all.
And I'm tired of you.


814
01:22:29.191 --> 01:22:30.650
Because you're a coward.

815
01:22:31.858 --> 01:22:33.983
I'm going for a smoke. I'm done.

816
01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:35.775
Yeah, you do that.

817
01:22:35.816 --> 01:22:38.525
You go have a smoke
and leave me to feel guilty.


818
01:22:38.608 --> 01:22:42.775
Just like you've done my whole life.
Amazing parenting as always, Mother.


819
01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:44.608
You're being so unfair right now.

820
01:22:44.691 --> 01:22:47.691
And what do you know about fair?
Huh? Is my life fair?


821
01:22:47.775 --> 01:22:49.733
Making you breakfast every day?

822
01:22:49.816 --> 01:22:51.233
Doing your shopping?

823
01:22:51.316 --> 01:22:53.150
Taking care of your child?

824
01:22:53.233 --> 01:22:55.066
Doing laundry? 
Cleaning for you?

825
01:22:56.191 --> 01:23:00.025
Oh yeah. But that's not enough, is it?
You need an apartment as well.


826
01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:04.316
Ya know, Karina, I really don't understand
how you can live with a man who's so weak.


827
01:23:05.816 --> 01:23:09.025
Oh, look, speaking of the weak.
The little prince is laughing.


828
01:23:09.108 --> 01:23:11.275
Well isn't that nice?

829
01:23:11.358 --> 01:23:14.733
I'm so glad you're enjoying yourself,
Jan, because no one else is.


830
01:23:14.816 --> 01:23:17.733
I hope to God this wakes you up.
You hear me, Janek? Wake up!


831
01:23:17.816 --> 01:23:19.816
- Or you'll end up like your father!
- Shut up!


832
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.983
- Excuse me?
- I said shut up.


833
01:23:22.066 --> 01:23:23.066
You shut up!

834
01:23:23.733 --> 01:23:24.941
'Cause I wanna thank you guys.

835
01:23:25.025 --> 01:23:26.816
What a wonderful life.
I wanna thank you all!


836
01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:29.191
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm asking you that.


837
01:23:29.275 --> 01:23:30.525
I am so sick of you people.

838
01:23:30.608 --> 01:23:34.566
I'm sick of you, and I'm sick of you,
and I'm sick of you as well!


839
01:23:36.816 --> 01:23:38.233
Grandma's gone!

840
01:23:46.066 --> 01:23:47.233
Grandma!

841
01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:50.316
Grandma!

842
01:23:51.233 --> 01:23:52.775
Mom, where are you?

843
01:23:56.816 --> 01:23:58.608
Mama!

844
01:24:01.358 --> 01:24:03.150
Grandma!

845
01:24:09.566 --> 01:24:10.775
Grandma!

846
01:24:19.691 --> 01:24:23.358
Hey, there, pretty lady!
I fucking love you.


847
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:26.150
- You know that?
- Fuck are you doing here? Go home.


848
01:25:25.691 --> 01:25:27.358
I'll stay somewhere tonight.

849
01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:35.858
When you coming home?

850
01:25:38.525 --> 01:25:39.608
Don't know.

851
01:26:22.441 --> 01:26:23.608
Secret.

852
01:26:29.066 --> 01:26:30.400
<i>Honesty.</i>

853
01:26:33.275 --> 01:26:34.316
Obligation.

854
01:26:41.441 --> 01:26:42.441
<i>Need.</i>

855
01:26:49.316 --> 01:26:50.566
<i>Family.</i>

856
01:26:56.441 --> 01:26:57.691
<i>You.</i>

857
01:27:00.941 --> 01:27:02.275
I love you.

858
01:28:02.983 --> 01:28:04.650
- How 'bout here?
- Morning.


859
01:28:04.733 --> 01:28:06.709
- I want this area clear.
- Okay.


860
01:28:06.733 --> 01:28:09.608
A lot of foot traffic here...

861
01:28:10.108 --> 01:28:12.566
- Good morning.
- No, it still looks crooked.


862
01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:15.108
- Let's move these chairs.
- Lower.


863
01:28:15.816 --> 01:28:17.275
- Hey.
- Hey.


864
01:28:17.983 --> 01:28:19.025
What do you think?

865
01:28:19.108 --> 01:28:20.775
- Check...
- Looks nice.


866
01:28:20.858 --> 01:28:22.251
"TO CATCH A TRAIN GOING ANYWHERE..."

867
01:28:22.275 --> 01:28:26.191
I've been telling you from the beginning
this slogan's too pretentious for him.


868
01:28:26.275 --> 01:28:29.316
You should've made it, "You are fucked."
Get right to the point.


869
01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.066
I just wanted it to be poetic.

870
01:28:31.150 --> 01:28:34.025
Today is not just about him.
It's about all of us, right?


871
01:28:35.775 --> 01:28:37.066
What's up with you?

872
01:28:40.108 --> 01:28:41.108
Nothing.

873
01:28:42.191 --> 01:28:44.525
You guys have been
so doom and gloom lately.


874
01:28:44.608 --> 01:28:47.233
What, are you surprised?
Men are more emotional than women.


875
01:28:47.316 --> 01:28:50.150
It's ingrained in us, you know,
Because of the societal pressures.


876
01:28:50.233 --> 01:28:52.733
- Catholicism, the patriarchy.
- Check, one, two.


877
01:28:53.816 --> 01:28:55.316
I've got a slogan.

878
01:28:56.066 --> 01:28:58.066
Hmm... Rejection.

879
01:29:03.816 --> 01:29:05.608
Good morning.

880
01:29:05.691 --> 01:29:07.400
Good morning to you all.

881
01:29:12.733 --> 01:29:14.066
Well, everyone,

882
01:29:15.608 --> 01:29:17.733
I have an announcement to make now.

883
01:29:17.816 --> 01:29:20.025
We will not be expelling anyone.

884
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.441
I'm sure that the students
who caused this whole mess


885
01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:26.566
will make for great custodians
around here.


886
01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:29.191
We'll need a lot of them
to keep things in order.


887
01:29:29.275 --> 01:29:30.983
And I will personally make sure

888
01:29:31.066 --> 01:29:33.733
they don't get into any trouble
over the summer break.


889
01:29:33.816 --> 01:29:34.816
Now...

890
01:29:35.441 --> 01:29:37.941
I'll see you in the auditorium. And...

891
01:29:38.816 --> 01:29:42.025
I'm counting on you to not be late.

892
01:29:50.233 --> 01:29:54.275
I wanted to tell all of you
that I've handed in my resignation.


893
01:29:55.983 --> 01:29:58.608
After today,
I won't be a teacher here anymore.


894
01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.066
I just don't feel that
it's the right place for me.


895
01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:07.393
Now, I can tell you're distraught that
I'm leaving you right before your finals,


896
01:30:07.441 --> 01:30:08.650
and I understand that.

897
01:30:11.025 --> 01:30:12.191
Life's hard.

898
01:30:14.316 --> 01:30:16.816
It just is what it is,
and you'll get through it.


899
01:30:22.191 --> 01:30:25.483
It's very hard for me
to say goodbye to all of you like this.


900
01:30:25.566 --> 01:30:27.025
But it's what's best.

901
01:30:27.608 --> 01:30:29.858
And I've learned
to be hopeful for the future.


902
01:30:29.941 --> 01:30:32.816
- I wanted to thank you for teaching me.
- We're fucked...


903
01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:34.025
Especially one of you.

904
01:30:35.316 --> 01:30:36.441
Thank you so much.

905
01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:41.900
Thank you.

906
01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.025
You really are fucked.

907
01:31:59.108 --> 01:32:01.650
And a whore.

908
01:32:04.316 --> 01:32:05.775
What happens now?

909
01:32:06.608 --> 01:32:08.816
I told you, I've decided to resign.

910
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.691
You can always un-resign, right?

911
01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.025
Hey.

912
01:34:21.566 --> 01:34:24.191
I think
I may have come at a bad time.
