1
00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.638
[funky intro playing]

2
00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:10.434
[cheering and applause]

3
00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:32.373
[Jerry] What is the idea
of the buffet?


4
00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.625
Well, things are bad.

5
00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:36.335
How could we make it worse?

6
00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:38.003
[laughter]

7
00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:42.341
Why don't we put people that
already struggling with portion control…


8
00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:43.551
[laughter]

9
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.099
into some kind of debauched,
<i>Caligula</i> food orgy


10
00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.309
of unlimited human consumption?

11
00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:53.894
[laughter, applause]

12
00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:59.358
Let's make the entrance
a chocolate syrup water park slide.


13
00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:02.611
[laughter]

14
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.322
The buffet is like
taking your dog to Petco


15
00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:07.616
and letting your dog do the shopping.

16
00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:11.078
You give him your wallet
in the parking lot


17
00:01:11.162 --> 00:01:14.748
and go, "Why don't you go in,
get whatever you think


18
00:01:14.832 --> 00:01:17.626
is the right amount
of dog food for you?

19
00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.714
Use your dog judgment.

20
00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:24.216
I'm gonna wait in the car.

21
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.927
Leave the window open a crack
so I can breathe."


22
00:01:28.137 --> 00:01:33.601
People do not do well
in an unsupervised eating environment.


23
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:35.936
[laughter]

24
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.855
Nobody would walk into a restaurant
and say,


25
00:01:37.938 --> 00:01:41.025
"I'll have a yogurt parfait, spare rib,
meat pie, crab leg, four cookies,


26
00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:42.485
and an egg white omelet."

27
00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:49.867
People are building death-row,
last-meal wish lists on these plates.


28
00:01:51.202 --> 00:01:53.120
It's like a perfect working model

29
00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:57.124
of all their emotional problems
and personal difficulties.


30
00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:59.126
They just walk around,
kind of hold it out.


31
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.128
"This is what I'm dealing with.

32
00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:05.132
It's a salad
with a scoop of ice cream on it.


33
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.801
I've got some unresolved issues

34
00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:10.304
I'm trying to work out
here at the buffet."


35
00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:12.306
[laughter]

36
00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.724
Start accosting strangers.

37
00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:17.686
"Excuse me, where did you get that?
What is that? I didn't even see that.


38
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.481
Is that a caramelized chicken leg?
I gotta try that. Gimme yours.


39
00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:23.275
You know where they are.
You can get more." Come on!


40
00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.361
[laughter]

41
00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:33.244
Twenty-two-year-old prayers,

42
00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:35.746
Twenty-two-year-old prayers be like…

43
00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:39.250
"Lord…

44
00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:44.421
please don't let me catch
any venereal diseases.


45
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:52.429
Thank God for this sweater."

46
00:02:52.513 --> 00:02:54.056
[laughter]

47
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.279
Forty-two-year-old prayers be like…

48
00:03:09.863 --> 00:03:10.698
"Lord…

49
00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:13.492
why am I so tired?

50
00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:16.704
[laughter]

51
00:03:18.205 --> 00:03:20.874
I'm taking the vitamins
like you said, Jesus.


52
00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.960
[laughter]

53
00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:29.216
Lord,

54
00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.430
please don't let him catch
any of my venereal diseases.


55
00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.515
[laughter]

56
00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:44.315
And, Lord, please don't let me
have to shit right after, Father.


57
00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:45.232
It is just--

58
00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:47.443
It's not sexy, Lord!"

59
00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.528
[laughter]

60
00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:55.659
I was on Facebook this week.

61
00:03:55.743 --> 00:03:58.704
Just making sure
my family's still racist, and…


62
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:02.833
That's a joke. 
I don't have to check. And…

63
00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:04.918
[laughter]

64
00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:10.299
I saw that a girl I went to high school
with just got back from her honeymoon.


65
00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:13.927
And she posted that she's going to be
taking a break from social media.


66
00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:18.098
Have you guys seen people do this?
Yeah, these, like, heroes of the internet?


67
00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.354
Their big announcement,
just, "Hear ye, hear ye!


68
00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:27.232
I will be taking a break
from social media.


69
00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:28.859
#Brave."

70
00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:33.572
It's like, "Dude, nobody wanted to see
a picture of your sandwich on Wednesday.


71
00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:35.991
No one's going to miss it on Friday.
All right?


72
00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:39.203
Also, why are you posting
about the fact you'll stop posting soon?


73
00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:41.664
That's like toasting the fact
you'll quit drinking.


74
00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:44.208
You're not off to a great start,
sweetheart.


75
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.293
[laughter]

76
00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.840
This girl made a whole video
for Instagram, Facebook, all of 'em.


77
00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:56.762
She's like, "Hey, guys, as you probably
heard, I just got married. [giggles]


78
00:04:56.845 --> 00:05:00.641
And I'll be taking a little bit of a break
from social media


79
00:05:00.724 --> 00:05:03.727
just to focus
on my new wifely duties."


80
00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:07.314
[laughter]

81
00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:08.440
Wifely duty.

82
00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:11.902
I'm like, you can't blow your husband
and share cat videos?


83
00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:15.114
[laughter]

84
00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:17.533
You have two hands. Multitask. Like…

85
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:19.576
Get an apron.

86
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.080
[laughter]

87
00:05:23.163 --> 00:05:26.917
I thought that was weird, so I played it
backwards. Sure enough, she's like,


88
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.380
"I've made a huge mistake.
Come pick me up. He's so boring!"


89
00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:34.133
We're like, "Yeah, we know. We met him."

90
00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:36.552
He's the type of guy you get halfway home
from the theme park


91
00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:38.804
before you're like,
"Oh shit, where's Doug?


92
00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:44.435
Oh no, we have to go back.
My wallet's in his fanny pack, so…"


93
00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:47.896
Oh, do not feel bad for Doug.
He's terrible.


94
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.859
Every time he tells a story,
somewhere a child loses a balloon.


95
00:05:51.942 --> 00:05:53.026
[laughter]

96
00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:02.745
You ever meet somebody,
and they're so boring,


97
00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:04.580
you feel like they poisoned you?

98
00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:07.875
Like, you're talking to them,
and you're like,


99
00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.918
"I feel like I'm dying right now,

100
00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:12.421
and I think you did it."

101
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.382
This guy's name is Craig.

102
00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:16.717
I met him--

103
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.260
I made sure to get it.

104
00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:21.555
I was, "I'm gonna remember you
for the rest of my life, man."


105
00:06:21.638 --> 00:06:25.726
He--I met him at the bank.
Is he a bank teller? No.


106
00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:28.437
Is he a security guard? Nope.

107
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.438
What's his job?

108
00:06:29.521 --> 00:06:33.525
I don't know. Whatever they call
that guy that stands in the lobby…


109
00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:37.738
of banks now, where you walk in,
and you’re like, “Do you work here?”


110
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:39.907
And he’s like, “I think so.” That guy.

111
00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:41.950
The lobby liaison.

112
00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:46.079
Well, I saw him. 
We made eye contact.

113
00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:49.541
I don’t know how you work.
For me, if we make eye contact,


114
00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:51.376
during the day, not at night,

115
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.669
but during the day…

116
00:06:52.753 --> 00:06:54.379
[laughter]

117
00:06:54.463 --> 00:06:58.008
out of human decency, I acknowledge you.
So that’s what I did.


118
00:06:58.091 --> 00:07:01.053
We made eye contact, and I go,
"How you doing?" And he went…


119
00:07:03.388 --> 00:07:05.307
And I was like, "Okay, so…"

120
00:07:06.934 --> 00:07:09.895
Then I get
to the second set of doors to walk in.


121
00:07:09.978 --> 00:07:14.024
And as I reach for that door,
I hear, "You going to the bank?"


122
00:07:14.107 --> 00:07:16.109
[laughter]

123
00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:20.614
I go, "Is this still a bank?"

124
00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:23.659
He goes, "Yeah." I go, "I’d like to."

125
00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:26.161
And he goes, "Go for it."

126
00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.412
And I was like…

127
00:07:29.414 --> 00:07:31.458
"Okay. Thanks."

128
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.256
And then I reach back, and he goes,
"I’m going to Virginia next week."


129
00:07:40.884 --> 00:07:42.469
"Are you telling me that?"

130
00:07:44.137 --> 00:07:47.057
He goes, "You said,
'How you doing?' when you got here.


131
00:07:47.683 --> 00:07:50.727
I had to think about it.
That's what I'm doing."


132
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:54.022
I go, "That’s the craziest shit
I’ve ever heard anybody say,


133
00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:57.609
and also not how that question works,
but all right."


134
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.281
And now I reach back, and he goes,

135
00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:04.533
"Yeah, my sister lives there,"
and I’m like…


136
00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:06.618
[laughter]

137
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:09.454
"How long's she lived there?"

138
00:08:11.164 --> 00:08:12.332
Now I’m roped in.

139
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:16.670
He goes, "Fifteen years."
And I go, "You’ve never been?"


140
00:08:16.753 --> 00:08:18.005
And he goes, "Uh-uh."

141
00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:23.176
Now I’m starting to look at him like,
"Hey, man, do you drive to work, or…


142
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.721
does somebody drop you off?
You know what I mean?"


143
00:08:25.804 --> 00:08:27.806
[laughter]

144
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.018
I think he…

145
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:33.103
[laughter]

146
00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:35.480
Yeah.

147
00:08:36.773 --> 00:08:39.443
I think he could
see it in my face,

148
00:08:39.526 --> 00:08:41.778
because,
out of nowhere, he goes, "I drive."


149
00:08:41.862 --> 00:08:44.406
I was like,
"That’s cool, man. That’s cool.


150
00:08:45.032 --> 00:08:46.867
I drive, too. That’s crazy. Uh…

151
00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:49.703
I gotta get in here."

152
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:54.124
He goes, "Yeah, we’re gonna check out DC
and see some monuments."


153
00:08:54.207 --> 00:08:57.461
I go, "I'd love to hear about it,
but I have to make a deposit."


154
00:08:57.544 --> 00:09:00.964
He goes, "I’ll be here when you walk out."
I go, "You motherfucker."


155
00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:03.884
Fuck that guy.

156
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:06.762
And fuck everybody like him.

157
00:09:08.138 --> 00:09:12.976
If you have the audacity to tell people
how you’re doing when they say,


158
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.480
"How you doing," that shit is rude
and selfish, all right?


159
00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:18.649
I’m serious.

160
00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:23.528
There are two acceptable answers
to how you doing: Fine and great.


161
00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.573
And if you’re miserable, you say, "Fine."

162
00:09:26.657 --> 00:09:30.410
You don’t burden people
with your real-world problems


163
00:09:30.494 --> 00:09:33.413
during a courteous exchange. Yeah.

164
00:09:33.497 --> 00:09:35.499
[laughter, applause]

165
00:09:40.087 --> 00:09:43.924
This is the world that we live in, though.
We have to care about everyone’s feelings,


166
00:09:44.007 --> 00:09:46.301
everyone’s tolerances,

167
00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:48.971
everyone’s intolerances,

168
00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:53.517
everyone’s dietary requirements.

169
00:09:54.935 --> 00:09:59.481
I’ll tell you where it’s gone too far,
and I have to be the person to say this.


170
00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:02.693
For the love of God… [breathes heavily]

171
00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:07.864
we have got enough milks now.

172
00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:09.950
[laughter]

173
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.831
Would everyone stop milking shit?!

174
00:10:15.914 --> 00:10:17.916
[laughter]

175
00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:22.713
I went to buy coffee recently.

176
00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:25.340
I have very straightforward coffee tastes.

177
00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.301
It should have been
a very straightforward transaction.


178
00:10:28.385 --> 00:10:29.928
It was anything but.

179
00:10:30.554 --> 00:10:34.391
I went in there. I was like,
"Hello, I’d like a white coffee, please."


180
00:10:34.474 --> 00:10:37.144
"Okay sir, what kind of milk
would you like with your coffee?


181
00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:39.855
We’ve got a coconut milk,
an almond nut milk,


182
00:10:39.938 --> 00:10:44.151
a hazelnut milk, a cashew nut milk,
a macadamia nut milk,


183
00:10:44.234 --> 00:10:46.695
we got an oat milk, rice milk,
hemp milk, soy milk.


184
00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:49.156
You can have it
from a bean, a pulse, a nut, a grain,


185
00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:52.075
an oat, a flax, a
leaf, a seed, a tree."

186
00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:56.329
[laughter, applause]

187
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.959
"I’d like it from a nipple, please.

188
00:11:02.544 --> 00:11:06.423
I don’t care what type of nipple.
Preferably a cow’s, but I’m not fussy.


189
00:11:06.506 --> 00:11:09.426
I’ll take it
from whatever nipple I can get."


190
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:12.721
She looked at me
like I had requested it from hers!


191
00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:16.516
Like I was the weirdo. 
I’m not the weirdo!

192
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.436
You’re the one in the back of the shop
with your little friends,


193
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:21.229
milking fucking cashew nuts.

194
00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:23.065
You’re the freaks, not me!

195
00:11:23.148 --> 00:11:25.442
I do not, for one moment, doubt

196
00:11:25.525 --> 00:11:30.238
that lactose intolerance is a very grave
and pressing issue for humanity.


197
00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:34.409
But lest I remind you,
we currently don’t have a cure for cancer,


198
00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:39.206
and there are 12 readily-available
milk substitutes on the market


199
00:11:39.289 --> 00:11:43.376
which, I would argue,
is 11 more than we need!


200
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.462
[laughter, applause]

201
00:11:49.174 --> 00:11:52.469
Yes, honey. You are somebody else's type.
You don't even know that.


202
00:11:52.552 --> 00:11:56.681
Like, I realized way too late in life
that I am an achievable Beyoncé


203
00:11:56.765 --> 00:11:58.141
for government workers.

204
00:11:58.225 --> 00:12:00.227
[laughter, applause]

205
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.364
Oh my God. Are you serious?

206
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.370
Anything like old Black government workers
named Lawrence, Dennis, Curtis, Otis,


207
00:12:18.453 --> 00:12:20.789
anything in an '-is,' they love <i>me!</i>

208
00:12:20.872 --> 00:12:23.083
-[laughter]
-[whoops]


209
00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:26.795
I can't go to a Veterans Day parade.
My booty ain't <i>safe.</i>


210
00:12:28.505 --> 00:12:29.422
She is not safe.

211
00:12:29.506 --> 00:12:33.176
They lookin' at me like they want me
to motorboat the PTSD off their face,


212
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.346
and I'll do it 'cause I'm a patriot.
Thank you so much.


213
00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:39.724
Oh! Thoughts and prayers.
Thank you for your service.


214
00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.518
Thank you so much.

215
00:12:42.352 --> 00:12:45.647
I don't know about you, but I can make
a government worker work a holiday.


216
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.065
That's power, bitch.

217
00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:48.150
[laughter, applause]

218
00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:49.317
What you do?

219
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.241
I'm just saying, you wanna go to the post
office with me in December, okay?


220
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.791
I’m at home.
The phone rings. It’s a school nurse.


221
00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:07.085
She goes, "I have Ila in the office.

222
00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:09.671
Is there a parent at home?"
I was like, "I’ll do."


223
00:13:09.754 --> 00:13:11.339
[laughter]

224
00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:15.844
Gives the phone to Ila. Her first words,
"I tried to stop it, Dad."


225
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.724
I go, "Stop what?"

226
00:13:20.807 --> 00:13:22.684
She goes, "I got my period."

227
00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:26.188
I’m like, "What do you need from me?
New pants, new panties, new socks?


228
00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:27.522
Did it get in your socks?

229
00:13:28.982 --> 00:13:32.611
A bucket, some towels, garlic?
We gotta keep the vampires away from you."


230
00:13:33.737 --> 00:13:37.574
She’s like, "Dad, I’m fine.
Mom gave me a go bag."


231
00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:40.410
I go, "Okay then.
What're you calling me for?"


232
00:13:41.244 --> 00:13:43.788
She goes, "I need you to go to the store
and get supplies."


233
00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:45.957
I’m like, "How bad is this period?"

234
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.629
She’s like, "No, Dad. I’m throwing myself
a period party tonight."


235
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.507
I’m like, "I’m sorry,
what did you just say?"


236
00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:56.384
She’s like, "All the girls are doing it.

237
00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.470
I need you to go to the store
and get supplies.


238
00:13:58.553 --> 00:14:00.513
Get a red velvet cake." I'm like…

239
00:14:01.514 --> 00:14:04.309
[retches]

240
00:14:08.772 --> 00:14:11.858
I go, "Baby, I don’t think
I can eat a red velvet cake…


241
00:14:12.776 --> 00:14:14.444
knowing what it symbolizes."

242
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.864
She’s like, "Dad, you need
a red velvet cake for a period party


243
00:14:17.948 --> 00:14:21.034
'cause you put the name of your period
on the cake." I’m like…


244
00:14:23.203 --> 00:14:24.704
"Who names their period?"

245
00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:29.292
She’s like, "Georgia named hers after
the girl from Progressive auto insurance."


246
00:14:29.376 --> 00:14:31.378
[laughter]

247
00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:37.884
She’s like, "Please, I need you right now.
I have ten people coming tonight."


248
00:14:37.968 --> 00:14:40.845
I go, "We have ten little girls
coming to the house?"


249
00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:42.889
She goes, "No, eight girls, two boys."

250
00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:47.894
I’m like,
"Who invites boys to a period party?"


251
00:14:47.978 --> 00:14:51.273
And I hear her sinister little giggle
on the phone,


252
00:14:51.356 --> 00:14:53.775
and she goes, "Dad,
that’s the fun of it.

253
00:14:54.901 --> 00:14:56.987
We don’t tell them why they’re there."

254
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.363
[laughter]

255
00:14:58.446 --> 00:15:00.699
Now I’m like, "Fuck it. I’m in."

256
00:15:02.409 --> 00:15:06.329
I have never had more fun
at a party in my entire life.


257
00:15:06.997 --> 00:15:10.000
Planning, hosting,
and attending a period party.


258
00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:13.169
I dressed all in red,
like it was Chinese New Year’s.


259
00:15:14.462 --> 00:15:18.425
Drinking Pinot noir.
I made pasta with chunky marinara sauce.


260
00:15:18.508 --> 00:15:20.719
[laughter]

261
00:15:21.386 --> 00:15:24.889
And I giggled the whole night
with all these little girls


262
00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:28.601
at these two boys, Max and Carter,
right? Faces covered in red cake,


263
00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:33.273
like it’s their honeymoon, and they’re
like, "Fuck it. I’ll eat it anyway."


264
00:15:33.356 --> 00:15:34.482
[laughter]

265
00:15:35.525 --> 00:15:36.484
The whole party,

266
00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:40.238
these two boys are looking at the cake,
going, "Who the hell’s Jason?"


267
00:15:41.489 --> 00:15:43.158
My daughter, Ila Kreischer…

268
00:15:43.783 --> 00:15:45.368
named her period Jason

269
00:15:46.328 --> 00:15:48.747
because she got it on Friday the 13th.

270
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.832
[cheering, applause]

271
00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:57.005
For 30 years,
I've been going up as Jo Koy.


272
00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:59.215
And then, when this last special came out…

273
00:15:59.632 --> 00:16:02.677
I had to do press,
and they kept interviewing me.


274
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:05.388
And every reporter
kept landing on the same question.


275
00:16:05.472 --> 00:16:07.182
"Why do you go by Jo Koy?"

276
00:16:07.265 --> 00:16:09.434
I was like, "I don't have an answer."

277
00:16:09.517 --> 00:16:10.852
[laughter]

278
00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:14.481
I go, "That's just what Filipinos do.

279
00:16:14.564 --> 00:16:18.109
They name you one thing,
and then fucking call you something else."


280
00:16:20.362 --> 00:16:22.113
And this is a very true story,

281
00:16:22.197 --> 00:16:25.950
'cause I just found this out, you guys.
This happened about four months ago.


282
00:16:26.034 --> 00:16:29.287
I went to Vegas,
and I took my Auntie Evelyn out to eat.


283
00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:32.207
And I just looked at her,
and I go, "Look, Auntie Evelyn,


284
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.127
a lot of reporters are asking me
where I got my nickname,


285
00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:37.921
and I don't have a story.

286
00:16:38.004 --> 00:16:39.631
So can you just tell me a story?

287
00:16:39.714 --> 00:16:42.550
Why you came up
with the nickname Jo Koy?"


288
00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.469
She's really old. 
You gotta understand.

289
00:16:44.552 --> 00:16:47.013
And she looked at me
and went like this. She goes…


290
00:16:48.431 --> 00:16:50.058
"I don't call you Jo Koy."

291
00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:52.727
[laughter]

292
00:16:57.732 --> 00:17:00.527
And then I was like,
"Oh my God, she's <i>old.</i>


293
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.573
She's--she's losing it. 
She's losing it."

294
00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:11.329
So I felt bad. I went like this. I go,
"Auntie, no, it's-- it's me. It's me.


295
00:17:11.413 --> 00:17:15.375
I'm Jo Koy. I'm-
-I'm Jo Koy.

296
00:17:15.458 --> 00:17:19.462
I'm Jo Koy, your favorite--
your favorite nephew.


297
00:17:19.546 --> 00:17:21.923
I'm-
-I'm Jo Koy."

298
00:17:23.174 --> 00:17:27.679
And then she goes,
"I know who you are. I'm not stupid.


299
00:17:27.762 --> 00:17:29.597
[laughter, applause]

300
00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:33.017
I'm just telling you
I don't call you Jo Koy."


301
00:17:34.227 --> 00:17:37.439
I go, "What're you talking about,
you don't call me Jo Koy? Like…


302
00:17:37.522 --> 00:17:39.524
Are you fucking with me right now? Like…

303
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.528
Are you being serious right now?
Thirty years, I've been going by Jo Koy.


304
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:44.654
You never said anything."

305
00:17:44.737 --> 00:17:46.823
She's like, "Yeah, 
I never said anything,

306
00:17:46.906 --> 00:17:50.326
because you keep saying, 'Jo Koy,'
so I just let you say it."


307
00:17:51.077 --> 00:17:54.456
"For 30 years, you let me say, 'Jo Koy,'
but you don't call me Jo Koy?


308
00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:58.376
I could've sworn that day when I was
at the house, you said, 'Jo Koy, eat.'


309
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.795
And I was like,
'Jo Koy, that's my nickname.'


310
00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:04.424
Are you serious right now?"
"Yeah, I don't call you Jo Koy."


311
00:18:08.511 --> 00:18:09.637
"Then what do you…

312
00:18:10.513 --> 00:18:12.056
Then what do you call me?"

313
00:18:13.057 --> 00:18:15.185
It's a true story, you guys.
You ready for this shit?


314
00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:16.978
It's gonna fucking make you cry.

315
00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:19.647
I swear I just found this shit out.

316
00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:22.567
I go, "Then what do you call me?"

317
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.486
She goes, "I call you Jo Ko.

318
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:27.363
That is your nickname, Jo Ko."

319
00:18:27.447 --> 00:18:30.366
And for all of you at home
that don't know what that means,


320
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.660
in Tagalog, <i>ko</i> means my.

321
00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:35.246
My nickname is My Jo.

322
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.665
Jo Ko. How fucking sweet is that?

323
00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:44.589
That's <i>so</i> sweet.

324
00:18:45.673 --> 00:18:47.258
I had no idea.

325
00:18:47.884 --> 00:18:50.303
I go, "That is the sweetest nickname."

326
00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:53.097
She goes, "You're the one
that keeps saying fucking Jo Koy.


327
00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:55.016
I don't know who the fuck that is.

328
00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:57.810
Every Netflix special,
'Coming to the stage, Jo Koy.'


329
00:18:57.894 --> 00:19:00.188
I'm like,
'Who the fuck is that? That's Jo Ko!'


330
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:01.564
That's Jo Ko.'"

331
00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:05.568
Why didn't she tell
me this 30 years ago?

332
00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:09.280
All my merchandise, misspelled.

333
00:19:16.329 --> 00:19:18.831
'Cause Black people don't pick up shit.

334
00:19:18.915 --> 00:19:22.126
You don't know
the last time you picked up some shit.


335
00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.921
Black people don't pick up no shit.
You better hope it rain.


336
00:19:25.004 --> 00:19:27.423
That's the only way
that shit getting off that block.


337
00:19:27.507 --> 00:19:31.302
If it don't rain,
the whole neighborhood going to be <i>shitty.</i>


338
00:19:31.386 --> 00:19:35.306
White people love to pick up shit.
You motherfuckers love to pick up shit.


339
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.809
White people can't <i>wait</i> to pick up shit.

340
00:19:37.892 --> 00:19:40.520
They go shopping for shit bags.

341
00:19:40.603 --> 00:19:43.022
Them blue bags.
They read the box and shit.


342
00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:46.442
"Biodegradable. 
Environmentally-friendly."

343
00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:48.945
They can't wait to--

344
00:19:49.028 --> 00:19:51.656
They got the little pouch
to put to put the shit bag.


345
00:19:51.739 --> 00:19:54.117
They got the shit bag fuckin' purse.

346
00:19:55.034 --> 00:19:57.287
They can't wait to rip off a sheet.

347
00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.415
You probably got some blue sheets
in your pocket right now.


348
00:20:00.498 --> 00:20:04.377
They can't wait to be like:
Fu-fow! Fwow!


349
00:20:05.712 --> 00:20:09.215
You know how much pressure it is,
being walked by a white dog owner?


350
00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:13.136
You can't just enjoy your walk.
You got to shit immediately.


351
00:20:13.219 --> 00:20:16.222
It ain't no, "Sit, Bruno."
It's like, "Shit, Bruno!"


352
00:20:17.348 --> 00:20:20.310
You know how stressed out that dog is?
He can't--


353
00:20:20.393 --> 00:20:24.063
You know that mother like this, "Here come
this motherfucker with these--"


354
00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:27.734
'Cause once a dog do this move right here,
ain't no coming back.


355
00:20:27.817 --> 00:20:30.486
Ain't no--
A human can't come back from this shit.


356
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.197
Try to fight somebody,
and you gotta shit, it's over.


357
00:20:33.281 --> 00:20:34.198
"I'll kick your--"

358
00:20:34.282 --> 00:20:35.241
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

359
00:20:36.659 --> 00:20:39.871
White people have them blue bags.
Fa fa fa, fwow!


360
00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:42.373
Ah!

361
00:20:42.457 --> 00:20:45.251
"Fuckin' yes, Bruno! Fuckin' yes!

362
00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:48.004
Great stool, Bruno!

363
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.214
Good job!"

364
00:20:50.298 --> 00:20:52.342
[inhales, shouts]

365
00:20:53.968 --> 00:20:56.137
They put it in
their pocket and walk away.

366
00:20:57.639 --> 00:21:00.642
Black people don't pick up no shit.
Ever see a Black person walk they dog?


367
00:21:00.725 --> 00:21:04.187
The dog starts to shit, they act like
they don't even know the dog no more.


368
00:21:04.687 --> 00:21:07.857
They like, "Oh, nah, you shitting?
Nah. I'm getting out of here.


369
00:21:08.483 --> 00:21:10.777
You gonna get us locked up, motherfucker.

370
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.196
You better do this shit right here.

371
00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:17.116
[laughs] That's the-- You better remember
this shit, motherfucker."


372
00:21:19.285 --> 00:21:21.704
That's the only way
the shit getting off of here.


373
00:21:25.124 --> 00:21:31.255
I don't understand what's going on
with the whole lotion thing with women.


374
00:21:31.339 --> 00:21:32.507
Right? I--

375
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.594
Okay, I've lived
with six girlfriends in my life.


376
00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:40.640
In my in my life,
I've lived with six women,


377
00:21:40.723 --> 00:21:42.850
and all six of them have left me.

378
00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:44.185
[laughter]

379
00:21:45.436 --> 00:21:49.023
And sooner or later,
I'm going to blame myself.


380
00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:52.068
But not today.

381
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:54.153
[laughter, applause]

382
00:21:56.489 --> 00:21:57.323
Now…

383
00:21:59.992 --> 00:22:03.121
Now, every single woman
I've ever lived with


384
00:22:03.204 --> 00:22:05.373
have a nighttime ritual where they--

385
00:22:05.456 --> 00:22:07.166
See, I have a bedtime ritual.

386
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.837
What I do is go to the bathroom,
have a piss, brush my teeth, go to bed.


387
00:22:12.004 --> 00:22:15.675
I've recently figured out
that I could do them at the same time.


388
00:22:16.217 --> 00:22:19.762
I have a piss, and I brush me teeth,
and I spit over, like that.


389
00:22:21.013 --> 00:22:22.515
Now, but the thing with women is

390
00:22:22.598 --> 00:22:25.560
you all go into the bathroom
for, like, twenty minutes,


391
00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:27.687
and you close the door,

392
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.022
and then you come out,

393
00:22:30.106 --> 00:22:33.735
and the last thing you do is you sort of--
you're rubbing something here,


394
00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:36.070
and then you go like this,

395
00:22:36.863 --> 00:22:39.991
and then you get into bed
and tell me what I've done wrong that day.


396
00:22:47.373 --> 00:22:49.959
And that's your little nighttime routine.

397
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:56.132
Now, I don't know
what goes on in that room,


398
00:22:56.924 --> 00:22:59.135
but I assume, I can't be positive,

399
00:22:59.218 --> 00:23:04.348
but I assume you were covering your body,
head to toe, in some type of lotion


400
00:23:04.432 --> 00:23:07.727
that you think
is vital for your existence.


401
00:23:09.228 --> 00:23:11.481
Now, I'm 42 years old.

402
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:18.404
Umm…I wear makeup for work.
When I'm on TV, they put makeup on me.


403
00:23:18.488 --> 00:23:21.616
I never even wipe it off. I just fuckin'--
They give me a towelette,


404
00:23:21.699 --> 00:23:23.576
and I go, "Oh, don't worry about it."

405
00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:27.622
It goes away over a week,
and they put it back on, and…


406
00:23:28.498 --> 00:23:31.083
Apart from that, I've worn sunscreen.

407
00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:36.047
But I've never put anything else
on my face, nothing else my entire life.


408
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.800
Umm, I'm arguably an alcoholic.

409
00:23:40.635 --> 00:23:42.887
I used to be a heavy smoker.

410
00:23:44.013 --> 00:23:46.390
I've been a cocaine addict.

411
00:23:47.016 --> 00:23:51.521
-[whooping]
-[laughter]


412
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.566
And my skin is fuckin' flawless.

413
00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.401
[laughter]

414
00:24:05.743 --> 00:24:07.620
I can't stand it
when you cum in my mouth,


415
00:24:07.703 --> 00:24:10.832
and then you stop watching
my Instagram Story the next day.


416
00:24:10.915 --> 00:24:12.458
Why'd you drop off?

417
00:24:12.542 --> 00:24:13.918
You watched it before.

418
00:24:15.294 --> 00:24:16.170
What happened?

419
00:24:17.547 --> 00:24:19.465
Oh, is there anything more pathetic

420
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:23.511
the next day, when you're trying to wait
for that guy to watch your Story again,


421
00:24:23.594 --> 00:24:25.721
and you post one?
You're like, "Hey, guys."


422
00:24:25.805 --> 00:24:29.725
But you're really being like,
"Hey guy, that I'm waiting to watch this."


423
00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:31.769
And you, like,
touch your mouth to remind him


424
00:24:31.853 --> 00:24:33.688
where his dick was hours before.

425
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:35.398
And you're like, "Oh, hey."

426
00:24:36.023 --> 00:24:38.234
And then you're just refreshing,
waiting for him,


427
00:24:38.317 --> 00:24:41.028
and then your dad DM's you,
like, "Killing it, Nick."


428
00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:43.239
And you're just like, "Not now, Dad!

429
00:24:43.948 --> 00:24:44.824
God.

430
00:24:44.907 --> 00:24:46.242
[laughter]

431
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:49.036
He's like,
"What'd you have for breakfast?"


432
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.455
And I'm like,
"Do you really want to know, Dad?


433
00:24:53.374 --> 00:24:57.086
An ounce of cum and a half a KIND Bar.
Okay? That is exactly…


434
00:24:59.714 --> 00:25:02.174
A KIND Bar and a mean load, Dad.

435
00:25:04.218 --> 00:25:06.762
What flavor? Mixed nuts. What else, Dad?"

436
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:08.764
I'm just…

437
00:25:09.265 --> 00:25:12.518
I just want to be a whore, I really do.
I am such a whore,


438
00:25:12.602 --> 00:25:15.229
but outside of a relationship,
I don't feel safe being a whore.


439
00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:17.440
I really don't,
and for a while I was like,


440
00:25:17.523 --> 00:25:19.817
"Oh, maybe if I don't have sex
or let them in my puss,


441
00:25:19.901 --> 00:25:22.361
I won't get attached.
Maybe if I just blow guys."


442
00:25:22.445 --> 00:25:25.573
So, I was blowing guys,
and that's not safe either, girls.


443
00:25:25.656 --> 00:25:28.951
There's something about their dick.
It's closer to your heart or something.


444
00:25:29.035 --> 00:25:30.161
It's just-
- It--

445
00:25:30.244 --> 00:25:31.954
[laughter]

446
00:25:32.038 --> 00:25:32.914
I go crazy.

447
00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:39.712
Handjobs. Handjobs are all I have
to get a guy off? No, thank you.


448
00:25:39.795 --> 00:25:42.757
I'm terrible at handjobs.
I'm bad at handjobs and guitar.


449
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.801
I know that about myself.
I have bad rhythm. It's--


450
00:25:45.885 --> 00:25:48.220
I wanna be good at guitar so bad.
I've taken so many lessons,


451
00:25:48.304 --> 00:25:52.224
and every guitar lesson has gone like
every handjob I've ever given. It has.


452
00:25:52.308 --> 00:25:56.062
I'm in a guy's studio apartment.
He's showing me a strumming pattern.


453
00:25:56.145 --> 00:25:59.065
I feel like I'm doing a good job,
and eventually he's like,


454
00:25:59.148 --> 00:26:01.025
"Let's do it together."
I'm like, "Okay."


455
00:26:01.108 --> 00:26:04.779
And we're doing it together.
I'm like, "All right, we're jammin'."


456
00:26:04.862 --> 00:26:06.489
Then he's like,
"Why don't you watch me?"


457
00:26:06.572 --> 00:26:09.033
I'm like, "I'm out. I don't care.
I'm not good at this.


458
00:26:09.116 --> 00:26:11.285
So I'm gonna wait
for my mom to pick me up."


459
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.288
And then he cums on me.

460
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.833
'Cause that's how I used to pay
for my guitar lessons.


461
00:26:17.917 --> 00:26:20.419
That was before Venmo.
It was a different time.


462
00:26:23.422 --> 00:26:26.926
In the Latino community,
we don't want to live forever.


463
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.263
We're not trying to make sure
that everything we eat is good for us.


464
00:26:31.347 --> 00:26:32.348
We know-
- Listen…

465
00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:36.185
You go to a Mexican restaurant,
you already know


466
00:26:36.894 --> 00:26:39.230
that we cook with fucking<i>manteca.</i>
Look at us.


467
00:26:39.313 --> 00:26:40.982
[laughter]

468
00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:44.652
We fuck obesity up. By the third grade,
we already said goodbye.


469
00:26:46.195 --> 00:26:48.280
"See you later, obesity.
Fuck, I passed you."


470
00:26:50.366 --> 00:26:52.660
And then little Latinos are all fat,
you know.


471
00:26:53.619 --> 00:26:57.248
You try to make 'em feel better.
You’re like, "<i>Mira, mijo</i>, you were--


472
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:00.084
You were going to be twins.
That’s why you’re, you know.


473
00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.171
You don’t hear a voice
telling you you’re full? No?


474
00:27:07.383 --> 00:27:10.344
You might listen. Might be your sister
trying to tell you."


475
00:27:11.053 --> 00:27:13.764
Bigger <i>chichis</i>than everybody
in the family at 11.


476
00:27:15.057 --> 00:27:16.726
"Hey, <i>Tetas</i>, come out here."

477
00:27:18.102 --> 00:27:21.022
That’s how you get your nickname.
You shit in your pants one time,


478
00:27:21.105 --> 00:27:23.357
you’re <i>Caca</i> for the rest of your life.

479
00:27:24.358 --> 00:27:26.736
You could be a grown man, fucking <i>Caca</i>.

480
00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:29.030
"Hey, guess who’s getting married."
"Who?"


481
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:30.489
<i>"Caca." "</i>Fuck!

482
00:27:32.116 --> 00:27:33.701
<i>Caca</i>’s getting married?"

483
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.787
"And his wife is pregnant." "<i>Chingado!</i>

484
00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:40.166
They’re gonna have
fuckin' <i>cacitas</i>running around.


485
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.337
<i>Caca’</i>s getting married, huh? Shit.

486
00:27:45.963 --> 00:27:47.590
Fucking <i>Caca.</i>Good for <i>Caca."</i>

487
00:27:49.341 --> 00:27:50.176
We don't know.

488
00:27:50.718 --> 00:27:53.929
Our parents-- Shit. We were raised
by the original body-shamers.


489
00:27:54.013 --> 00:27:56.140
They didn’t give a
fuck what age you were.

490
00:27:57.099 --> 00:28:00.436
They’d be leaving for work,
"Hey, you two fat fuckers right there.


491
00:28:01.771 --> 00:28:03.647
You better not be on that couch
when I get home,


492
00:28:03.731 --> 00:28:06.817
<i>Gordo</i>One and fuckin'g<i>Gordo</i> Two.
You hear me?"


493
00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:08.986
We would answer, "Yeah."
"All right.


494
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.529
Fucking clean yourselves.
C'mon."


495
00:28:10.613 --> 00:28:12.615
[laughter]

496
00:28:16.619 --> 00:28:18.662
This nigga Elon Musk
be goin' to space by hisself.


497
00:28:18.746 --> 00:28:21.749
What the fuck is that white man
doin' in space alone?


498
00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:24.251
That’s not suspicious to anybody but me?

499
00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:28.089
This motherfucker goes to space
without the government, without NASA?


500
00:28:28.172 --> 00:28:30.424
Which I didn’t even know
you could fucking do!


501
00:28:31.342 --> 00:28:35.137
As far as I knew, they were
the space niggas. They run space!


502
00:28:36.555 --> 00:28:39.391
You wanna fuck with space,
you gotta fuck with them.


503
00:28:39.475 --> 00:28:43.354
This motherfucker built a spaceship
like it’s a go-kart. Goes on Tuesdays.


504
00:28:43.938 --> 00:28:46.440
Bitch, space day is Saturday!

505
00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:48.651
Everybody know that!

506
00:28:49.819 --> 00:28:52.655
You can’t leave midweek
to go to goddamn space!


507
00:28:52.738 --> 00:28:55.116
It’s an event. It happens Saturday.
The TV’s on.


508
00:28:55.199 --> 00:28:57.701
This nigga be going Wednesday night. What?

509
00:28:58.452 --> 00:29:01.705
From Sacramento, at that.
Bitch, space place is Cape Canaveral.


510
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:03.249
That’s where you go from.

511
00:29:05.835 --> 00:29:08.921
Ain’t no entry point to Mars
from fuckin' Sacramento.


512
00:29:09.004 --> 00:29:10.673
[laughter]

513
00:29:12.466 --> 00:29:13.300
[laughs]

514
00:29:16.095 --> 00:29:19.014
When you goin' to space, you at least
tell the people. It’s a PSA.


515
00:29:19.098 --> 00:29:22.143
Get on the goddamn news. Say,
"Hey, I'm about to fuck around in space.


516
00:29:22.226 --> 00:29:25.062
Don’t be alarmed." This nigga just went.
We thought it was aliens. Aliens?


517
00:29:25.146 --> 00:29:28.607
No, it's just Elon doin' donuts
in the sky. What the fuck is this?


518
00:29:28.691 --> 00:29:31.402
[laughter, applause]

519
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.908
White man ambition is some <i>shit.</i>

520
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.454
You wanna know where the racism is?
That’s where the fuck it is: White men.


521
00:29:42.538 --> 00:29:45.249
I know y’all still confused. Look at him.
"What are you talking about?"


522
00:29:46.292 --> 00:29:47.710
Fuckin' confused.

523
00:29:49.128 --> 00:29:51.213
'Cause they don’t get--
Everyone learns the history.


524
00:29:51.297 --> 00:29:54.675
So you’re like, "No one’s getting hung,
and we ain’t beating nobody.


525
00:29:54.758 --> 00:29:57.928
I work next to a Black guy,
and he has a car, so equality."


526
00:29:59.013 --> 00:30:02.641
Just lay the fuck down.
Rest easy. "Everything’s fair."


527
00:30:04.351 --> 00:30:05.394
Fuckin' nutjob!

528
00:30:07.688 --> 00:30:09.231
Everything’s not fair!

529
00:30:09.315 --> 00:30:13.027
'Cause while you’re sleepin',
you’re dreaming about buying Mars, nigga!


530
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.320
[laughter]

531
00:30:16.322 --> 00:30:17.323
[scoffs]

532
00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:21.619
I never thought I could do shit like that.
I thought about having all the money.


533
00:30:21.702 --> 00:30:24.121
I thought, "If I get all the money,
I’ll buy them gold ceilings


534
00:30:24.205 --> 00:30:25.706
Master P had in<i>Cribs.</i> That's…

535
00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:30.920
That’s what the fuck Imma do
when I get all the goddamn money."


536
00:30:31.003 --> 00:30:33.631
Space by my goddamn self, bitch? Never!

537
00:30:34.924 --> 00:30:37.343
Even if I thought about going to space,
I’d call NASA first.


538
00:30:37.426 --> 00:30:39.261
"Yo, NASA, this Sam. Can I go?

539
00:30:40.387 --> 00:30:43.515
You know what? It is Tuesday.
Space day <i>is</i>Saturday."


540
00:30:43.599 --> 00:30:44.475
[laughter]

541
00:30:48.229 --> 00:30:51.357
You never know when someone’s gonna dump
some shit into your head


542
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.777
that’s gonna ruin your life,
or at least change it for months,


543
00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.278
or just cause you trouble.

544
00:30:56.362 --> 00:31:00.616
And it could be just in passing,
somebody just drops shit into your head,


545
00:31:00.699 --> 00:31:02.368
and you have to deal with it.

546
00:31:02.451 --> 00:31:04.453
Like, you could just be having a day,

547
00:31:04.536 --> 00:31:08.249
and somebody you know or don’t know
that well goes, "You taking turmeric?"


548
00:31:08.332 --> 00:31:09.208
"What?"

549
00:31:11.001 --> 00:31:13.128
"Turmeric, are you taking it?" "Turmeric?"

550
00:31:13.212 --> 00:31:15.965
"Yeah, you gotta take that shit."
"Turmeric?" "Yup."


551
00:31:16.048 --> 00:31:20.052
"The spice?" "Yeah, you gotta take it."
"Turmeric, the spice?"


552
00:31:20.135 --> 00:31:22.054
"Yeah, man, you gotta take that."

553
00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:26.684
"Th--The spice that you buy once
to make an Indian recipe…


554
00:31:28.018 --> 00:31:29.687
and you never use it again,

555
00:31:30.271 --> 00:31:32.982
and it stains your wooden spoon,
that turmeric?"


556
00:31:33.816 --> 00:31:35.567
"Yeah, you got to take that shit."

557
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:39.154
As he’s walking away, he’s like,
"Oh yeah, if you’re gonna get turmeric,


558
00:31:39.238 --> 00:31:42.157
make sure you get it with black pepper
in it, or it won’t activate."


559
00:31:42.241 --> 00:31:44.743
Now, right there,
doesn’t that make you go,


560
00:31:44.827 --> 00:31:46.662
"That sounds like bullshit
to me a little bit?


561
00:31:46.745 --> 00:31:49.164
Am I that big of a sucker
you think I would believe that?"


562
00:31:49.248 --> 00:31:52.918
Where’s the science on that? That sounds
like a couple of vitamin hustlers


563
00:31:53.002 --> 00:31:55.254
sitting over a mound of wholesale turmeric

564
00:31:55.337 --> 00:31:59.008
with a bunch of empty gel caps,
one guy going, "I don’t know, man.


565
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:01.593
I don’t think
we can move this just like this.


566
00:32:02.386 --> 00:32:03.846
It's just a spice.

567
00:32:04.346 --> 00:32:06.765
I think we gotta--
We gotta add something."


568
00:32:06.849 --> 00:32:10.436
"Yeah, like what, boss?"
I don’t know why it’s a '30s movie.


569
00:32:11.603 --> 00:32:15.858
"I don’t know, maybe another spice?"
"Yeah, like what? Maybe pepper?"


570
00:32:16.358 --> 00:32:17.735
"Yeah, keep talking."

571
00:32:17.818 --> 00:32:20.404
"Maybe we say it activates it?"

572
00:32:20.487 --> 00:32:24.325
"Holy shit! That's a fuckin'
million-dollar idea, right there.


573
00:32:24.408 --> 00:32:25.909
Let’s load up these gel caps.

574
00:32:25.993 --> 00:32:28.454
Maybe Rogan'll move 'em on his podcast."

575
00:32:28.537 --> 00:32:30.539
[laughter]

576
00:32:34.376 --> 00:32:38.589
I don't feel like my kids' private school
respects my level of celebrity.


577
00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:44.303
I don't. I really don't. I mean this.
I swear to God. I'm not playing.


578
00:32:44.386 --> 00:32:46.096
I'm gonna be very honest.

579
00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.599
It's my fucking household.
I'm not holding back.


580
00:32:48.682 --> 00:32:51.769
They don't respect my level of celebrity!

581
00:32:52.895 --> 00:32:54.188
I'm a very humble guy.

582
00:32:54.271 --> 00:32:55.481
[laughter]

583
00:32:56.732 --> 00:33:00.444
May not seem like it after that sentence,
but I am. I'm a very humble guy.


584
00:33:01.153 --> 00:33:04.323
What's understood doesn't need to be said.
You know who I am, and I know you know


585
00:33:04.406 --> 00:33:05.324
who the fuck I am.

586
00:33:05.407 --> 00:33:07.076
Don't make me say who I am.

587
00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:10.704
They put me in a position
to have to say who I am.


588
00:33:11.455 --> 00:33:12.915
I go drop my
kids off at the school.

589
00:33:12.998 --> 00:33:14.875
Teachers come running out,
surround my car.


590
00:33:14.958 --> 00:33:17.586
"Mr. Hart,
we'd love to talk to you for a second.


591
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:19.380
The big fair is coming up.

592
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.633
We do this fair
once a year at the school.


593
00:33:22.716 --> 00:33:23.717
We would love it

594
00:33:24.468 --> 00:33:27.304
if you would be
the greeter at this year's fair."


595
00:33:31.683 --> 00:33:34.978
[laughter, appaluse]

596
00:33:37.606 --> 00:33:41.527
I gave her a lot of time for her to say,
"I'm bullshittin'." She never said it.


597
00:33:42.152 --> 00:33:44.154
I said, "Are you fucking kidding me?"

598
00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:47.991
"No. It's our biggest fair.
We'd love it if you'd be the greeter.


599
00:33:48.075 --> 00:33:51.870
We think you would make
an amazing greeter at this year's fair."


600
00:33:52.496 --> 00:33:55.165
Before I go on with this joke,
I wanna make this perfectly clear.


601
00:33:55.249 --> 00:33:59.586
First things first,
I have nothing against greeters, okay?


602
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.131
I don't wanna tell this joke
and walk outside my house,


603
00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:05.008
and there's a group of ya'll with signs
talking about Cancel Kevin Hart


604
00:34:05.092 --> 00:34:06.844
'cause he don't respect greeters.

605
00:34:06.927 --> 00:34:09.680
"Cancel Kevin Hart
because he don't respect the greet."


606
00:34:09.763 --> 00:34:11.432
Greeters are amazing people.

607
00:34:12.015 --> 00:34:14.476
The job is actually required. I get it.

608
00:34:15.185 --> 00:34:18.439
I've actually been hit
with some amazing greetings in my time.


609
00:34:19.606 --> 00:34:21.650
I want to Walmart.
I got hit with a greeting


610
00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:23.235
so fucking fantastic one time.

611
00:34:23.318 --> 00:34:26.989
I don't even know where he came from.
He just slid in my POV.


612
00:34:27.072 --> 00:34:28.824
I walked in. He was like,
"Welcome to Walmart.


613
00:34:28.907 --> 00:34:31.493
You here to get you some stuff?"
I was like, "What the fuck.


614
00:34:32.202 --> 00:34:34.037
Where did you come from, man?"

615
00:34:35.372 --> 00:34:38.000
He's like, "You better get you
some stuff. We rolling back prices."


616
00:34:38.083 --> 00:34:40.669
Then he moonwalked.
He just moonwalked out the way.


617
00:34:40.752 --> 00:34:44.715
I said, "What the fuck just happened?
What just happened here?"


618
00:34:44.798 --> 00:34:49.094
I was so blown away by the greeting,
not only did I go get me some stuff,


619
00:34:49.178 --> 00:34:52.473
I broke my neck
looking for this guy on the way out.


620
00:34:53.307 --> 00:34:55.142
I want him to see my stuff. "Hey!

621
00:34:56.351 --> 00:34:57.811
Come here, man. Hey!

622
00:34:58.437 --> 00:35:00.397
Come here.
I wanna show you my stuff!"


623
00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:05.277
He came over.
I opened my bag. He was like, "Oh!"


624
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.362
[laughter]

625
00:35:08.197 --> 00:35:09.031
He said,

626
00:35:09.114 --> 00:35:11.116
"Oh!"

627
00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:13.535
"You got you some <i>good</i> stuff."

628
00:35:14.828 --> 00:35:16.705
Took out his highlighter,
swiped my receipt


629
00:35:16.788 --> 00:35:18.624
so people knew I didn't steal.

630
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.418
He said, "Make sure
you come and see me again."


631
00:35:21.502 --> 00:35:23.921
I said, "Will you be here?"
He said, "If I'm not, who will?"


632
00:35:24.004 --> 00:35:26.757
Moonwalked out the way again.
I said, "What the fuck?!"


633
00:35:27.633 --> 00:35:30.761
That was one of the best
goddamn greetings I've ever seen, man.


634
00:35:30.844 --> 00:35:32.888
"Of course
Imma come back and see you again."


635
00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:35.807
I'm not shittin' on greeters.

636
00:35:35.891 --> 00:35:38.602
I'm just saying
I didn't have to go that route.


637
00:35:39.102 --> 00:35:41.897
I went around that
to get to my success.

638
00:35:43.023 --> 00:35:45.984
You don't come to me
and ask me to be a fuckin' greeter.


639
00:35:46.527 --> 00:35:49.238
I had a number one movie
in the box office at the time.


640
00:35:49.905 --> 00:35:52.032
I was on the side of fuckin' buses.

641
00:35:53.534 --> 00:35:55.744
You don't ask me to be the <i>greeter.</i>

642
00:35:56.787 --> 00:35:58.664
There's other parents
who got kids who go there


643
00:35:58.747 --> 00:36:02.334
that are former actors and actresses
that you could've fuckin' asked.


644
00:36:02.417 --> 00:36:04.378
Carlton from <i>The Fresh Prince, </i>Alfonso,

645
00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:06.964
that's your greeter. 
This right here,

646
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:10.050
that's who you want at the front.
That's your greeter.


647
00:36:11.385 --> 00:36:13.887
Terry Crews, he got kids that go there.
That's your greeter.


648
00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.305
Pec-popping at the front.

649
00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:18.934
[repeating] "Hey!

650
00:36:20.018 --> 00:36:23.397
Hey, hey, hey. Welcome to the fair.
Who want a ticket? Hey, hey, hey, hey."


651
00:36:24.231 --> 00:36:26.817
What a combination.
Parents would've went crazy. "Whoa!


652
00:36:27.609 --> 00:36:28.860
What a school!

653
00:36:29.903 --> 00:36:32.447
I want tickets.
I'm going to buy every ticket I can."


654
00:36:32.531 --> 00:36:34.074
[repeating] "Hey!"

655
00:36:34.992 --> 00:36:37.869
Parents would be blown away.
"These greeters are amazing."


656
00:36:37.953 --> 00:36:39.955
[laughter]

657
00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:47.129
And at the beginning,
we all had one password.


658
00:36:47.212 --> 00:36:51.091
It was our first password.
We can nostalgically remember.


659
00:36:51.174 --> 00:36:54.303
And we used it for everything.
Every time we joined another business.


660
00:36:54.386 --> 00:36:57.806
"Can I have your password?"
"Yes, you can. That is my special word."


661
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.393
And then,
companies started getting quite rude.


662
00:37:01.476 --> 00:37:04.062
You would put your password in,
and it would go, "Weak."


663
00:37:04.146 --> 00:37:07.399
"Who are you to judge my special word?"

664
00:37:07.482 --> 00:37:09.735
[laughter]

665
00:37:09.818 --> 00:37:12.112
They're like, "Sorry,
but the internet has become popular.


666
00:37:12.195 --> 00:37:13.697
We need to strengthen your password."

667
00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.741
And businesses would insist,

668
00:37:15.824 --> 00:37:18.535
"We must have from you a capital letter.

669
00:37:18.619 --> 00:37:22.080
I'm sorry, we will not
be accepting passwords anymore


670
00:37:22.164 --> 00:37:26.335
unless it contains
at least <i>one</i> capital letter."


671
00:37:26.918 --> 00:37:30.213
And we all momentarily
considered our options


672
00:37:30.297 --> 00:37:35.344
before deciding to capitalize
the first letter of our password.


673
00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:39.931
And for a period
of time, that was fine.

674
00:37:40.015 --> 00:37:42.893
But the internet became
even more popular.


675
00:37:42.976 --> 00:37:46.730
And then businesses started saying,
"I'm afraid you cannot join


676
00:37:46.813 --> 00:37:52.653
unless you have at least one
capital letter and at least one <i>number!"</i>


677
00:37:53.236 --> 00:37:54.237
Again,

678
00:37:54.738 --> 00:37:59.534
less than
half a micro-second's consideration,


679
00:37:59.618 --> 00:38:01.745
before we collectively decided

680
00:38:01.828 --> 00:38:04.247
you shall be getting the number one,

681
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:09.503
and that will be at the end
of my now capitalized password.


682
00:38:10.712 --> 00:38:13.048
And for a period of time,

683
00:38:13.131 --> 00:38:14.675
this was acceptable

684
00:38:15.258 --> 00:38:19.179
until a whole new, unexpected,

685
00:38:19.262 --> 00:38:22.349
and exciting dawn emerged,

686
00:38:22.432 --> 00:38:26.561
a world of special characters.

687
00:38:27.145 --> 00:38:29.314
We didn't even know what they were.

688
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.777
And businesses would say,
"We need a capital letter,


689
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.907
we need a number, but we will also require
a special character."


690
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:43.495
And we clicked on the button.
"Please, can I have some examples


691
00:38:43.578 --> 00:38:47.165
of these special characters
which you now insist upon?"


692
00:38:47.249 --> 00:38:49.418
And we perused them. "There they are.

693
00:38:49.501 --> 00:38:53.714
I had no idea
these characters were so special."


694
00:38:54.339 --> 00:39:01.054
Until all of our eyes
stopped upon the exclamation mark.


695
00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:02.973
[laughter, applause]

696
00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:05.308
"You're coming with me."

697
00:39:06.226 --> 00:39:10.856
Which we then put at the end
of our now capitalized password,


698
00:39:10.939 --> 00:39:12.482
just after the "one."

699
00:39:13.567 --> 00:39:19.072
And it's at this moment that everybody
at the London Palladium is thinking,


700
00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:21.241
"I should probably change my password.

701
00:39:21.324 --> 00:39:24.077
I'm probably going to do that tomorrow.
Or do that now."


702
00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:24.995
[laughter]

703
00:39:28.582 --> 00:39:31.251
Growing up in the South,
we love two things,


704
00:39:31.334 --> 00:39:33.503
and that was church and Chili's.

705
00:39:34.921 --> 00:39:39.050
Everybody in the South goes to church.
There's one on every corner.


706
00:39:39.134 --> 00:39:42.262
They even try to fool you
with churches. Like right now,


707
00:39:42.345 --> 00:39:44.431
you think you're in a theater.

708
00:39:44.514 --> 00:39:46.600
[laughter, applause]

709
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:54.191
But the reward for going to church
is that then you get to go to Chili's.


710
00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:59.696
And Chili's, in my hometown,
was the fanciest restaurant.


711
00:40:00.238 --> 00:40:04.034
It was so fancy,
I referred to it as <i>Chilé's.</i>


712
00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:10.457
Now, I grew up Methodist,
which is considered Christian light.


713
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.585
Yeah.
Just a little dab will do you. Just boop!


714
00:40:14.252 --> 00:40:17.130
Just a little bit of Jesus,
that's all you need.


715
00:40:18.381 --> 00:40:22.719
All we cared about was that the preacher
was done with his sermon by noon


716
00:40:22.803 --> 00:40:25.222
so we could beat the Baptists
to the Chili's.


717
00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:27.098
Right?

718
00:40:27.182 --> 00:40:29.184
[laughter, applause]

719
00:40:30.101 --> 00:40:34.689
It'd be 11:55, and if the preacher
was still yammering on,


720
00:40:34.773 --> 00:40:38.735
you could hear the choir
slowly start singing.

I have good news.
I finally smoked weed with my mom.


726
00:41:06.388 --> 00:41:07.305
Did it.

727
00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:10.642
Took me 36 years of campaigning.
Finally did it.


728
00:41:10.725 --> 00:41:16.022
Now, keep in mind,
my mom is a 700-year-old Jew, okay?


729
00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.482
Wasn't easy.

730
00:41:17.566 --> 00:41:20.193
No, she came to my house,
we were in Los Angeles,


731
00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:22.946
and I'm driving around with my mom,
and I go, "Smoke pot with me."


732
00:41:23.029 --> 00:41:25.198
And she goes, "No. 
It's illegal."

733
00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:29.327
I go, "No, it's not. It's legal now."
And she goes, "Oh, okay."


734
00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:30.704
I swear to God, it was that easy.

735
00:41:30.787 --> 00:41:33.582
So we went to my house,
and I'm trying to smoke a bowl with her,

00:41:33.665 --> 00:41:37.002

her eyes got all red,

741
00:41:48.513 --> 00:41:50.473
"My mouth is dry.

742
00:41:52.017 --> 00:41:54.185
Is that part of the appeal?"

743
00:41:55.562 --> 00:41:57.939
And then she snapped.
She was like, "Bring it in.


744
00:41:58.023 --> 00:42:00.108
Bill Cosby didn't do it.

745
00:42:01.401 --> 00:42:03.069
I did it!"

746
00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:06.448
And I haven't seen her since.

747
00:42:06.531 --> 00:42:09.743
-[laughter]
-[Eric laughs]


748
00:42:09.826 --> 00:42:12.162
By the way,
Bill Cosby is guest bartending tonight


749
00:42:12.245 --> 00:42:15.373
if you guys want
some <i>really</i> strong drinks!


750
00:42:15.457 --> 00:42:16.541
[whoops]

751
00:42:21.796 --> 00:42:25.383
I saw a great documentary on Ted Bundy.
Did anybody see that?


752
00:42:25.467 --> 00:42:29.888
It was a four-hour,
four-part Ted Bundy documentary.


753
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:34.601
And they said, originally, he wanted to be
an attorney or a politician.


754
00:42:34.684 --> 00:42:37.854
When I heard that,
the whole thing kind of made sense.


755
00:42:37.979 --> 00:42:40.398
Like, all right. He actually took
the more admirable route.


756
00:42:42.859 --> 00:42:47.113
I've seen about 30 documentaries
on Ted Bundy, and I gotta be honest,


757
00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.990
I'm a little sick and tired

758
00:42:49.074 --> 00:42:52.410
of the hero-worship
we have of serial killers in this country.


759
00:42:52.494 --> 00:42:54.537
And I say we,
'cause I've been guilty of it too.


760
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:58.375
But you can tell it's more
than just curiosity and voyeurism.


761
00:42:58.458 --> 00:43:02.087
It's admiration. You can tell
by the language used in the documentaries.


762
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.173
They don't talk about Ted Bundy
the way they should talk about him.


763
00:43:05.256 --> 00:43:06.841
If they were speaking about him honestly,

764
00:43:06.925 --> 00:43:10.178
every sentence would start with,
"And then, this piece of shit…"


765
00:43:10.261 --> 00:43:12.263
[laughter, applause]

766
00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:16.685
But they don't do that.
They give the obligatory,


767
00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:18.728
"He was wicked. He was evil."

768
00:43:18.812 --> 00:43:21.982
But then they find
almost admirable qualities,


769
00:43:22.065 --> 00:43:24.609
and they harp on them.
First of all, his intellect.


770
00:43:24.693 --> 00:43:27.112
They can't stop talking
about his intellect,


771
00:43:27.195 --> 00:43:29.572
which was overrated.
He was not that bright.


772
00:43:29.656 --> 00:43:32.909
They're like,
"Ted Bundy was so intelligent.


773
00:43:32.993 --> 00:43:34.786
He escaped from jail twice."

774
00:43:34.869 --> 00:43:36.746
You know how he escaped
from jail the first time?


775
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.457
The window was open, and he jumped out.

776
00:43:39.541 --> 00:43:40.583
[laughter]

777
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:45.755
That's how a cat or bird
would escape from prison.


778
00:43:47.632 --> 00:43:50.343
You're not a mastermind
if you're in jail and see an open window,


779
00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:52.387
and you're like, "Freedom is that way!"

780
00:43:54.389 --> 00:43:57.600
They called him a genius
because I think they like the idea


781
00:43:57.684 --> 00:43:58.810
of the wicked genius.

782
00:43:58.893 --> 00:44:02.981
They said, "Ted Bundy was a genius.
He acted as his own attorney."


783
00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.316
They <i>executed</i> him.

784
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.782
He sucked as a lawyer.
You're not a genius


785
00:44:12.866 --> 00:44:15.702
if you get the worst--
He couldn't have done worse.


786
00:44:17.996 --> 00:44:20.915
If he had hired
an orangutan to represent him,


787
00:44:21.791 --> 00:44:26.212
and it just shit in its own hand
and mushed it in the face of the jury,


788
00:44:27.172 --> 00:44:30.425
it would have gotten the same sentence
Ted got making an effort.


789
00:44:31.176 --> 00:44:33.178
[laughter, applause]

790
00:44:34.804 --> 00:44:39.517
And collectively, can we agree,
stop harping on his appearance?


791
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:41.394
He was an average-looking guy,

792
00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:44.647
but they can't stop talking about,
"Oh my God, he was charming.


793
00:44:44.731 --> 00:44:47.317
Ted Bundy was so handsome."
No, he wasn't.


794
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.195
He was handsome in that pool of people.

795
00:44:52.947 --> 00:44:56.659
Okay? In the group of men
who have murdered and raped


796
00:44:56.743 --> 00:44:58.119
40 or more women…

797
00:45:00.038 --> 00:45:01.331
Ted's a catch.

798
00:45:08.254 --> 00:45:12.592
I'm married. I have a white wife
and a white son-- white stepson.


799
00:45:13.134 --> 00:45:15.595
Blonde hair, blue eyes. 
Little white son.

800
00:45:16.221 --> 00:45:18.473
I've been raising him
since he was two years old.


801
00:45:18.556 --> 00:45:20.725
We call him Miklo, yes. Miklo.

802
00:45:21.643 --> 00:45:23.978
But he thinks he's Mexican too, now!

803
00:45:24.813 --> 00:45:26.856
He be steppin' up to fools,

804
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.776
"What's up, fool?
You fucking with <i>la raza?"</i>


805
00:45:32.612 --> 00:45:34.489
I'm like, "Hey, calm down, Scott.

806
00:45:36.449 --> 00:45:39.202
That's the condo association.
Don't fuck around."


807
00:45:41.663 --> 00:45:43.498
White boys are down, though.

808
00:45:44.415 --> 00:45:48.211
When you have a white boy
who's the fuck in your gang, he's down.


809
00:45:48.962 --> 00:45:50.338
White boys are crazy, man.

810
00:45:50.421 --> 00:45:53.967
They come up with fucking crimes
that we could never think of.


811
00:45:55.468 --> 00:45:57.303
One time, this white <i>cholo</i>comes up to me.

812
00:45:57.387 --> 00:46:00.473
"What's up, homie?
You want to do a home invasion, bitch?"


813
00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.684
I'm like, "Fuck. Who's house, Ryan?"

814
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.479
"My mom's house.

815
00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:08.106
[laughter, applause]

816
00:46:09.482 --> 00:46:12.902
That bitch didn't want
to make me a sandwich last night."


817
00:46:13.903 --> 00:46:16.531
You get proud of your stepson
when he does stuff,


818
00:46:16.614 --> 00:46:18.700
even though I don't help him do anything.

819
00:46:19.534 --> 00:46:23.163
I'm always right there,
"Yeah, you know, I'm his only father."


820
00:46:23.955 --> 00:46:28.293
But if my son becomes
a serial killer or a school shooter,


821
00:46:28.376 --> 00:46:32.130
Imma be like, "Hey bro, you fuckin' know
how fucking white people are, bro..


822
00:46:34.883 --> 00:46:37.302
I was scared for my life!

823
00:46:38.511 --> 00:46:40.805
One time, he dressed up like a ghost.

824
00:46:40.889 --> 00:46:44.267
I didn't know if he was a ghost
or a fucking KKK member."


825
00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.352
[laughter, applause]

826
00:46:49.689 --> 00:46:52.901
There are still a lot of Greeks alive
and thriving in the world today.


827
00:46:52.984 --> 00:46:53.902
Hello and welcome.

828
00:46:53.985 --> 00:46:56.613
No, just the ancient Greeks.
They are all dead.


829
00:46:56.696 --> 00:46:59.741
They lived on a busy road
that was built by the ancient Romans.


830
00:47:02.869 --> 00:47:05.121
Now, who have we got here?
We've got Pythagoras.


831
00:47:05.205 --> 00:47:07.332
He's busy naming all the triangles!

832
00:47:08.958 --> 00:47:10.543
That's a cute one.

833
00:47:14.255 --> 00:47:15.632
Then you've got Socrates here.

834
00:47:15.715 --> 00:47:17.884
He took a bit of a tumble.
Classic Socrates.


835
00:47:17.967 --> 00:47:20.845
Good with the thoughts,
shit with the walk. Get up, mate. Arugula?


836
00:47:22.847 --> 00:47:24.015
What were the women doing

837
00:47:24.098 --> 00:47:27.018
while all the men were doing
the important naming of all the things?


838
00:47:27.101 --> 00:47:28.394
From my research, what I gather,

839
00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:32.148
women were generally standing around
in groups of three, naked,


840
00:47:32.232 --> 00:47:36.611
just waiting for men
to name all of the things.


841
00:47:37.362 --> 00:47:39.239
You see it happening
with this central figure.


842
00:47:39.322 --> 00:47:42.367
She's saying, "What have you got
in your hand there, Karen?"


843
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.452
[laughter]

844
00:47:48.957 --> 00:47:50.708
"Just a couple of bits and bobs."

845
00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:57.131
Women were just holding things.
Just waiting, hoping it wasn't poisonous.


846
00:47:57.215 --> 00:47:59.801
Waiting for men to name the things.

847
00:47:59.884 --> 00:48:01.928
This was painted before beds were named.

848
00:48:02.011 --> 00:48:04.305
You can see women desperately trying
to make the beds,


849
00:48:04.389 --> 00:48:07.225
just flinging the linen
into the trees willy-nilly.


850
00:48:07.308 --> 00:48:10.687
Just going, "I don't know.
Let's just build a fort.


851
00:48:12.313 --> 00:48:14.274
We'll make it a fancy fort!"

852
00:48:15.775 --> 00:48:18.236
"Yay! We finished the fort!"

853
00:48:20.029 --> 00:48:22.365
Dancing naked
in groups of three in the forest


854
00:48:22.448 --> 00:48:25.410
is the number one hobby
of women of all time.


855
00:48:26.494 --> 00:48:27.787
And don't we just love it?

856
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:30.331
Isn't that the safest thing
you've ever heard of? Love it.


857
00:48:30.415 --> 00:48:33.376
Now this might just look like
a footloose, fancy-free frolic


858
00:48:33.459 --> 00:48:35.962
in the forest on
a bank holiday, no drama.

859
00:48:36.963 --> 00:48:39.674
But let me draw your attention
to this grip here.


860
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.469
That is too tight for fun times alone.

861
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.347
It suggests tension.

862
00:48:47.223 --> 00:48:49.767
What has happened?
Has someone mentioned the paleo?


863
00:48:49.851 --> 00:48:50.768
No.

864
00:48:51.436 --> 00:48:53.438
What has happened
is this central figure, here,


865
00:48:53.521 --> 00:48:55.690
has realized that this bit of cloth,
this waft of gauze,


866
00:48:55.773 --> 00:48:57.859
this potential fort, if you will,

867
00:48:58.443 --> 00:49:01.404
has made its way
so far up her clacker…


868
00:49:03.323 --> 00:49:07.410
so far up her clacker,
it had both fannies covered.


869
00:49:08.244 --> 00:49:10.413
And she is upset!

870
00:49:13.041 --> 00:49:14.792
Now, it's worth pointing out
at this juncture


871
00:49:14.876 --> 00:49:19.047
that this is not a photograph.
This is not an accidental photograph…


872
00:49:19.797 --> 00:49:23.176
taken of an unfortunate moment. Awkward.

873
00:49:24.302 --> 00:49:26.846
No. What this is, is a painting.

874
00:49:28.056 --> 00:49:29.807
Which makes this…

875
00:49:33.603 --> 00:49:35.146
a decision!

876
00:49:37.315 --> 00:49:41.110
It's a decision.
One a man made and spent time on.


877
00:49:41.194 --> 00:49:43.363
[laughter]

878
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.826
Oh my God!

879
00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:50.578
[whoops]

880
00:49:50.661 --> 00:49:53.623
That's what I do now,
by the way. I hike.

881
00:49:53.706 --> 00:49:55.291
It's my thing now. I hike.

882
00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:58.544
Hiking is not my exercise.

883
00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:00.546
It's my activity.

884
00:50:02.048 --> 00:50:04.217
Because hiking is not an exercise.

885
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.179
It's the segue between the actual exercise
you did in your 20s and 30s


886
00:50:08.262 --> 00:50:11.265
and then the gentle mall walking
you're going to do…


887
00:50:12.058 --> 00:50:14.102
in your 70s and 80s

888
00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:17.230
so that you'll fit
into the tuxedo at the funeral home.


889
00:50:17.313 --> 00:50:20.024
'Cause you don't want 'em
splitting the back of the jacket open.


890
00:50:20.108 --> 00:50:23.277
That's embarrassing. Come on.
Let's die with some dignity.


891
00:50:23.361 --> 00:50:24.737
So what I do every day,

892
00:50:25.321 --> 00:50:29.200
I park my car
at the base of a hiking trail.


893
00:50:29.283 --> 00:50:32.954
Then, I walk away from my car…

894
00:50:34.122 --> 00:50:37.792
until I eventually turn around

895
00:50:38.626 --> 00:50:41.254
and walk back to my car. And that's--

896
00:50:41.879 --> 00:50:43.548
That's what I do.

897
00:50:43.631 --> 00:50:47.677
There I am,
out there with all the other 50-year olds.


898
00:50:48.177 --> 00:50:50.096
Doing our little doom ovals.

899
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.104
And if you were to fly a helicopter

900
00:50:58.187 --> 00:51:00.273
low over the Earth,
you know what you would see?


901
00:51:00.982 --> 00:51:03.651
You'd see people in their 20s

902
00:51:03.734 --> 00:51:07.029
gobbling drugs,
eating delicious food, having sex.


903
00:51:08.197 --> 00:51:11.492
People in their 30s, with actual jobs,
making the world run.


904
00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.245
People in their 40s…

905
00:51:15.163 --> 00:51:17.248
tying to fuck the 20-year olds.

906
00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:19.667
[laughter]

907
00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:23.838
And then us,
the gentle, surrendered 50-year olds,


908
00:51:25.006 --> 00:51:28.342
on our little futility ovals.

909
00:51:31.012 --> 00:51:32.597
We've got our earbuds in,

910
00:51:33.556 --> 00:51:35.433
listening to podcasts…

911
00:51:37.435 --> 00:51:41.439
which are done by 20-year olds
that nobody wants to fuck.


912
00:51:41.522 --> 00:51:43.524
[laughter]

913
00:51:48.196 --> 00:51:51.616
If we're going to understand our country,
we have to understand our beliefs.


914
00:51:51.699 --> 00:51:53.451
-Do you agree?
-[audience] Yes.


915
00:51:53.534 --> 00:51:56.662
Right? And what we must understand
is that they are not true,


916
00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:58.498
but we really fucking believe them.

917
00:51:59.624 --> 00:52:03.711
For instance, all Indians must stand
for the national anthem.


918
00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.297
I believe it.

919
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.257
But, technically, we don't have to.

920
00:52:09.258 --> 00:52:11.052
Probably should. Safety issue.

921
00:52:11.135 --> 00:52:13.095
[laughter]

922
00:52:13.179 --> 00:52:15.181
Because there are dudes
multitasking in the room,


923
00:52:15.264 --> 00:52:16.307
singing while whooping ass.

924
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:19.018
[sings indistinctly and shouts]

925
00:52:20.394 --> 00:52:22.438
So stand for the national anthem, man.

926
00:52:22.522 --> 00:52:24.482
It's pretty chilled out,
our national anthem.


927
00:52:24.565 --> 00:52:26.526
Like, a definitive end. 
It's not too long.

928
00:52:26.609 --> 00:52:28.778
You know when it's over.
We all just kind of go…


929
00:52:28.861 --> 00:52:31.614
[sings indistinctly]

930
00:52:31.697 --> 00:52:32.532
Hey!

931
00:52:34.825 --> 00:52:36.536
Nobody died. Okay, sit down.

932
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:38.538
[laughs]

933
00:52:38.621 --> 00:52:40.790
These guys never know when to sit down.

934
00:52:40.873 --> 00:52:44.335
<i>♪ For the land of the free ♪</i>

935
00:52:44.919 --> 00:52:47.964

938
00:52:59.308 --> 00:53:00.142
[laughter]

939
00:53:05.523 --> 00:53:09.569
That football player who took a knee
wasn't protesting. He was just resting.


940
00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:12.572
We don't have to stand
for the national anthem.


941
00:53:12.655 --> 00:53:15.491
Do you know how I know?
The announcement says, "Please.


942
00:53:18.536 --> 00:53:20.871
Please stand for the national anthem."

943
00:53:20.955 --> 00:53:24.792
In standard Indian rules,
if the announcement says please,


944
00:53:24.875 --> 00:53:26.210
we don't do that shit.

945
00:53:28.129 --> 00:53:30.548
"Please wait
'til your plane has reached the gate


946
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:32.550
before you use your cell phone."

947
00:53:33.801 --> 00:53:35.052
Fuck off!

948
00:53:36.679 --> 00:53:38.806
We are in the air,
we see a building we recognize,


949
00:53:38.889 --> 00:53:40.766
we'll start trying to call people, right?

950
00:53:41.767 --> 00:53:45.021
"Please don't piss on the wall."
That's what walls are for.


951
00:53:45.688 --> 00:53:49.066
America should be very grateful
they share a border with Mexico, not us.


952
00:53:51.652 --> 00:53:52.778
Because, you know…

953
00:53:55.114 --> 00:53:55.990
If it was us,

954
00:53:56.073 --> 00:53:59.660
and they built a wall, they'd have
a very different problem on their hands.


955
00:53:59.744 --> 00:54:01.871
[Donald Trump voice] "Why do they
keep pissing on us?"


956
00:54:07.376 --> 00:54:09.420
You're picturing that now,
aren't you? [laughs]


957
00:54:09.503 --> 00:54:11.505
[laughter, applause]

958
00:54:14.258 --> 00:54:15.843
Young people love to kiss.

959
00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:20.139
They suck each other's tongues.

960
00:54:20.222 --> 00:54:22.933
I saw this young couple
in an elevator just making out.


961
00:54:23.017 --> 00:54:26.854
Didn't care that we were in the elevator.
Sucking each other like licorice. [kisses]


962
00:54:26.937 --> 00:54:29.482
Then he stuck his finger down her throat.

963
00:54:31.317 --> 00:54:32.693
Right? He just stuck it-
-[moans]

964
00:54:32.777 --> 00:54:35.571
And she started sucking it
like it was a penis.


965
00:54:36.197 --> 00:54:38.658
If I tried to stick my finger
in my wife's mouth,


966
00:54:38.741 --> 00:54:41.952
she'd be like, "What the--
What the fuck was that?


967
00:54:43.204 --> 00:54:45.956
Are you mad at me? 
What the fuck did I do?

968
00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:52.797
You don't want to listen to me, tell me
to shut the fuck up. Don't do that.


969
00:54:53.547 --> 00:54:56.175
You just scratched your nuts
for a half hour on the couch


970
00:54:56.258 --> 00:54:57.385
watching the game.

971
00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:01.806
Alls I taste is mushrooms.
I hate mushrooms.


972
00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.309
Fuckin' truffle-nuts. 
Leave me alone."

973
00:55:08.688 --> 00:55:11.065
Yeah, around 45, you stop kissing.

974
00:55:11.148 --> 00:55:13.609
That's when you're like-
- [kisses]

975
00:55:13.693 --> 00:55:14.819
"Hi. Goodbye."

976
00:55:14.902 --> 00:55:17.988
Yeah, because he has a dead tooth,
and you don't have dental.


977
00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.367
"Let's not do that anymore. How's that?"

978
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:23.452
[laughter, applause]

979
00:55:27.164 --> 00:55:29.333
Now there are things that we do

980
00:55:29.417 --> 00:55:31.711
that we think we're nailing,
and we're not.


981
00:55:32.211 --> 00:55:33.337
Like thongs,

982
00:55:34.338 --> 00:55:35.506
jandals,

983
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:37.842
flip-flops,

984
00:55:38.926 --> 00:55:41.887
plakkies.
That's what we call them in South Africa.


985
00:55:42.805 --> 00:55:45.975
You know, we will never have world peace

986
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.145
unless we can agree
on a name for these shoes.


987
00:55:52.648 --> 00:55:56.736
Now, the thing with those shoes,
they don't come with instructions.


988
00:55:56.819 --> 00:55:58.946
The thing is, they really should.

989
00:55:59.697 --> 00:56:02.950
'Cause I never owned a pair
'cause I grew up on a farm in South Africa


990
00:56:03.033 --> 00:56:05.286
where we have
snakes, and scorpions, and shit.


991
00:56:05.828 --> 00:56:09.290
So you can't have any of that.
So the first time I ever bought a pair


992
00:56:09.373 --> 00:56:13.127
was when I was in my mid-30s,

993
00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.628
And no one stopped me.

994
00:56:14.712 --> 00:56:17.882
Like, I bought them. No one,
as I got to the door, went, "Hey…


995
00:56:19.258 --> 00:56:21.343
have you used those before?"

996
00:56:22.511 --> 00:56:23.971
You go, "No, I haven't."

997
00:56:24.054 --> 00:56:24.972
"Come here.

998
00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:27.725
Hey, just so you know,

999
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:32.646
if a drop of moisture
get on the inside of that shoe,


1000
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:33.689
you're dead.

1001
00:56:36.233 --> 00:56:40.821
Oh, and if a drop of moisture
gets on the outside of that shoe, [laughs]


1002
00:56:40.905 --> 00:56:41.822
you're dead.

1003
00:56:44.033 --> 00:56:47.995
Oh, and don't think,
for a second, that you can run…


1004
00:56:49.497 --> 00:56:52.917
from your car, during a thunderstorm…

1005
00:56:55.461 --> 00:56:59.632
into the mall
where they've gone ahead and tiled it.


1006
00:57:02.426 --> 00:57:05.221
Because,
whether you're physically prepared or not,


1007
00:57:05.304 --> 00:57:07.848
you're going to do
the full fucking splits."


1008
00:57:10.267 --> 00:57:13.687
And you're like, "Okay.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Cool."


1009
00:57:14.188 --> 00:57:16.649
And as you walk out,
they go, "Oh, one more thing.


1010
00:57:16.774 --> 00:57:21.862
Just so you know, those shoes,
they're only for forward motion.


1011
00:57:23.614 --> 00:57:25.783
We call them one-directional.

1012
00:57:26.867 --> 00:57:30.371
Yeah. You wanna take a step to the side?
You're dead.


1013
00:57:32.122 --> 00:57:35.626
You wanna take a step back?
My uncle tried that. He's dead!"


1014
00:57:37.461 --> 00:57:40.714
Those shoes are so complex, man.
They should come with a warning


1015
00:57:40.798 --> 00:57:44.301
and someone to live with you
for, like, a week after you buy them.


1016
00:57:45.219 --> 00:57:48.097
And I learned that I'm officially
at the age-weight ratio


1017
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:50.015
where I no longer fall over.

1018
00:57:51.642 --> 00:57:52.768
I had a fall.

1019
00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.816
You don't know when
it will happen to you.

1020
00:57:59.525 --> 00:58:03.320
Even five years ago, my friends
would've gone, "Were you drunk?" [laughs]


1021
00:58:03.404 --> 00:58:05.823
Now, I get all these concerned emojis.

1022
00:58:07.825 --> 00:58:10.911
"Mate, are you all right?
I believe you had a fall." I'm like,


1023
00:58:12.413 --> 00:58:15.082
"No, bitch, I was wearing
my death booties. I forgot."


1024
00:58:15.666 --> 00:58:17.126
[laughter]

1025
00:58:21.213 --> 00:58:22.882
[Tom] These are the good times.

1026
00:58:22.965 --> 00:58:25.885
People talk about the good old days
all the time, right, lately?


1027
00:58:25.968 --> 00:58:28.304
"What if we just go back
to the good old days?"


1028
00:58:28.387 --> 00:58:30.389
"The good old days." Are you kidding me?

1029
00:58:30.472 --> 00:58:32.558
These are the good old days.

1030
00:58:32.641 --> 00:58:36.145
The good old days? We're just
figuring out how to do stuff now.


1031
00:58:36.228 --> 00:58:38.355
And we don't even
have it figured out, yet.


1032
00:58:38.439 --> 00:58:41.400
You wanna go to the good old days?
They didn't know how to do anything there.


1033
00:58:41.483 --> 00:58:42.484
Nothing!

1034
00:58:42.568 --> 00:58:44.820
You ever see
the first bicycle ever made?


1035
00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:47.364
I don't know how to make anything.

1036
00:58:47.448 --> 00:58:50.743
But I know you don't take
the smallest wheel you can find


1037
00:58:50.826 --> 00:58:52.328
and put that in the back…

1038
00:58:53.996 --> 00:58:55.831
and the biggest wheel on earth

1039
00:58:56.457 --> 00:58:57.833
and put that up front.

1040
00:58:57.917 --> 00:59:00.252
[laughter]

1041
00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:01.545
It's a bad bike.

1042
00:59:05.382 --> 00:59:07.760
You couldn't even get
in the seat by yourself.


1043
00:59:07.843 --> 00:59:12.389
Your friends had to fling you up there
by the ends of your handlebar mustache


1044
00:59:12.473 --> 00:59:14.308
and hope you landed on the seat.

1045
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:17.436
And once you started peddling,
you couldn't stop.


1046
00:59:17.519 --> 00:59:19.438
You peddled 'til you died.

1047
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.609
And that was okay, 'cause
your life expectancy in the good old days?


1048
00:59:23.692 --> 00:59:25.069
Twenty-eight years old!

1049
00:59:27.446 --> 00:59:31.325
Please. A horrible time to live.
Hospitals were a nightmare.


1050
00:59:31.408 --> 00:59:33.327
All they did was cut your leg off.

1051
00:59:34.119 --> 00:59:35.496
Didn't matter what you had.

1052
00:59:36.622 --> 00:59:40.250
Broken arm? The flu?
You walked in, you hopped back out.


1053
00:59:42.461 --> 00:59:47.049
No medicine. No medicine.
No Advil. Could you imagine?


1054
00:59:47.633 --> 00:59:50.094
A life without Advil. Oh!

1055
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.349
Ever go to the cabinet
and realize you're out of Advil? Ah!


1056
00:59:56.392 --> 00:59:58.811
I just lay on the ground
and hope to die.


1057
01:00:01.313 --> 01:00:04.316
What're you gonna take?
That 12-year-old Benadryl from the back?


1058
01:00:06.527 --> 01:00:08.779
They had no TUMS. No TUMS!

1059
01:00:08.862 --> 01:00:11.407
You ate, got gassy and exploded.

1060
01:00:14.994 --> 01:00:16.704
These are the good old days.

1061
01:00:18.622 --> 01:00:21.625
Look at all your outfits. Look at
these beautiful fabrics you're wearing.


1062
01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:24.586
And I know you had options.
This isn't your only outfit.


1063
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:27.881
No, not in the good old days.
One hard, woolen outfit.


1064
01:00:28.924 --> 01:00:31.719
Hard leather shoes
made out of pig livers.


1065
01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.179
And burlap underpants.

1066
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.223
Burlap underpants.

1067
01:00:37.141 --> 01:00:39.018
Ever see
black-and-white pictures from back then?


1068
01:00:39.101 --> 01:00:41.562
They're all angry,
just staring at the camera.


1069
01:00:43.313 --> 01:00:46.775
Like, "What's wrong with those people?
Why were they so unhappy?"


1070
01:00:46.859 --> 01:00:48.152
Burlap underpants.

1071
01:00:51.488 --> 01:00:52.406
Awful.

1072
01:00:52.489 --> 01:00:53.532
[laughter, applause]

1073
01:00:57.369 --> 01:01:00.706
Come home, start playing video games.
<i>Grand Theft Auto 3.</i>


1074
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:02.750
[cheering]

1075
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:03.792
Fans of <i>GTA.</i>

1076
01:01:03.876 --> 01:01:06.378
First time in a video game
you could do anything you felt like.


1077
01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:07.963
You can do whatever the fuck.

1078
01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:11.508
Go steal guns. Steal a car. No worries.

1079
01:01:11.592 --> 01:01:15.345
Can run over people.
The police comes. You can kill the police.


1080
01:01:16.055 --> 01:01:18.891
Then they send the army,
which you can also kill.


1081
01:01:19.391 --> 01:01:23.604
And if, in the middle of that, by mistake,
if you die, you are just alive again.


1082
01:01:23.687 --> 01:01:26.940
In the hospital, but without guns.
Go back to stealing guns.


1083
01:01:30.027 --> 01:01:31.737
But it was too much freedom

1084
01:01:32.237 --> 01:01:33.739
for my mentality at the time.

1085
01:01:34.615 --> 01:01:37.868
"You can do anything."
"Yes, but what are you supposed to do?"


1086
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.789
"Anything! Go wild."
"Yes, but what is the objective?"


1087
01:01:44.249 --> 01:01:47.461
I looked it up and found out
exactly the shit you needed to do.


1088
01:01:47.544 --> 01:01:49.630
Did all that, finished the game.

1089
01:01:50.422 --> 01:01:53.300
End of the game, you get statistics,
which is how many times you've died,


1090
01:01:53.383 --> 01:01:54.885
how many people you've killed,

1091
01:01:55.385 --> 01:01:58.806
and a very interesting thing
called completion percentage.


1092
01:01:59.306 --> 01:02:02.434
And it said, "Completion percentage, 12%."

1093
01:02:04.019 --> 01:02:04.853
Huh?

1094
01:02:05.938 --> 01:02:09.024
I finished the game. 
That's a 100%.

1095
01:02:09.733 --> 01:02:12.361
No, no no. You've just reached the ending.

1096
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:16.740
But you only did 12%
of all the things you could've done.


1097
01:02:18.408 --> 01:02:20.661
Well, fuck!

1098
01:02:21.995 --> 01:02:23.831
What if life is like that?

1099
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.709
What if you die
and go to the afterlife,

1100
01:02:27.793 --> 01:02:29.461
and they give you a report card?

1101
01:02:30.963 --> 01:02:32.005
"Three percent?"

1102
01:02:34.633 --> 01:02:36.718
"You didn't do any of the side missions."

1103
01:02:38.303 --> 01:02:39.429
"Like-- like what?"

1104
01:02:40.222 --> 01:02:42.432
"Like, see here at a party?
Someone gave you a joint.


1105
01:02:42.516 --> 01:02:44.309
You said, 'No, thanks.' 
Fifteen percent."

1106
01:02:45.435 --> 01:02:46.520
"All right, then."

1107
01:02:50.315 --> 01:02:52.359
"You loved someone.
You wanted to tell them.


1108
01:02:52.442 --> 01:02:54.528
Instead, you said, 'Ah! Bye.

1109
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.656
It was a dare!'"

1110
01:03:00.826 --> 01:03:02.161
It wasn't a dare.

1111
01:03:02.244 --> 01:03:04.246
[laughter]

1112
01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:09.042
[chuckles]

1113
01:03:09.126 --> 01:03:12.045
My granddaddy
used to love to watch wrestling.


1114
01:03:12.129 --> 01:03:15.924
He had this thing about Black wrestlers
beating the shit out of white wrestlers.


1115
01:03:16.008 --> 01:03:18.260
Like, like Thunderbolt Patterson?

1116
01:03:18.343 --> 01:03:20.512
He would scream at the TV
when Thunderbolt Patterson


1117
01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:23.932
was beating the shit out of
somebody white. "Kill that cracker!"


1118
01:03:24.975 --> 01:03:27.728
And I'd be sitting next to him,
"Kill that cracker!"


1119
01:03:28.228 --> 01:03:31.565
I had no fucking clue you white people
was supposed to be crackers.


1120
01:03:32.191 --> 01:03:35.360
So when I got older, I wanted to go see
a match on my own, y'all.


1121
01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:38.447
So I'm at-
-I'm at Peachtree downtown.

1122
01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:41.241
[chuckles]

1123
01:03:41.325 --> 01:03:44.203
I go--I go to this-- I'm on my way
to the wrestling match,


1124
01:03:44.286 --> 01:03:47.164
and I stop at a Marriott hotel
to call my brother, like,


1125
01:03:47.247 --> 01:03:49.499
"Hurry the fuck up.
We gonna miss the goddamn match."


1126
01:03:49.583 --> 01:03:52.753
He's like, "I'm on my way." So,
I hang up the phone, but I look up,


1127
01:03:52.836 --> 01:03:55.047
and this white man is staring at me.

1128
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:58.800
He was like, "Hey, how you doing?"
I'm like, "Hey, how <i>you</i> doing?"


1129
01:03:59.801 --> 01:04:02.012
He was like, "You wanna go
to my room with me?"


1130
01:04:02.095 --> 01:04:03.222
I'm like, "Okay."

1131
01:04:03.305 --> 01:04:05.515
[laughter]

1132
01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:08.435
I ain't never been
to a Marriott hotel before.


1133
01:04:10.103 --> 01:04:11.897
Especially not in their room.

1134
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:15.442
He opened the door, y'all,
and the first thing I noticed,


1135
01:04:15.525 --> 01:04:16.860
he had fuckin' air conditioning.

1136
01:04:16.944 --> 01:04:18.695
We didn't have that
when we were coming up.


1137
01:04:18.779 --> 01:04:21.657
We had that one fan
that my momma kept in front of her pussy,


1138
01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.326
and it blew her pussy
all through the house all day.


1139
01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:28.413
Like, "Can someone tell momma
her pussy stank today?"


1140
01:04:32.417 --> 01:04:34.878
He go over to the little refrigerator
in the hotel room.


1141
01:04:34.962 --> 01:04:37.965
He opened the door, ya'll,
and he gave me a real Coca-Cola.


1142
01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:40.926
At this time in my life,
I had never had a real Coca-Cola.


1143
01:04:41.009 --> 01:04:43.929
Colas, and maybe Kool-Aid,
but not Coca-Cola.


1144
01:04:44.012 --> 01:04:46.306
I was so fucking excited,
I popped that shit,


1145
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:48.058
and I drunk it in one swallow.

1146
01:04:48.141 --> 01:04:50.102
He walked me over to the bed.
He don't say shit.


1147
01:04:50.185 --> 01:04:52.688
He just unzipped his pants
and take out his white dick.


1148
01:04:52.771 --> 01:04:54.982
And I had never seen
a white dick before, ya'll.


1149
01:04:55.065 --> 01:04:58.318
And white dicks
look like an uncooked chicken leg to me.


1150
01:04:58.402 --> 01:05:00.404
[screaming, laughter]

1151
01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:10.872
[laughs] Look at all the white dudes,
like, "What the fuck's she talking about?"


1152
01:05:11.957 --> 01:05:13.417
[laughs]

1153
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.503
And he wrapped my hand around.
He made me go up and down


1154
01:05:16.586 --> 01:05:18.130
and up and down.

1155
01:05:18.213 --> 01:05:21.508
And I'm thinking to myself,
"Is this how white people barbecue?


1156
01:05:23.385 --> 01:05:26.430
'Cause this chicken leg
needs some fucking seasoning salt."


1157
01:05:27.931 --> 01:05:31.601
About five minutes in, something came out
of the chicken leg, y'all.


1158
01:05:32.185 --> 01:05:34.688
So he took it out of my hand,
and he wiped my hand off,


1159
01:05:34.771 --> 01:05:36.148
and he gave me $100.

1160
01:05:36.231 --> 01:05:38.775
I'm like, "Sir,
are you gon to be here tomorrow?"


1161
01:05:38.859 --> 01:05:40.652
[laughter]

1162
01:05:44.323 --> 01:05:47.409
That was a lot of fuckin' money
for an 11-year old.


1163
01:05:47.492 --> 01:05:48.410
[groaning]

1164
01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.498
Oh, fuck you, white people!

1165
01:05:55.042 --> 01:05:58.670
That's more money than
your lemonade stands ever fuckin' made.


1166
01:06:02.299 --> 01:06:06.595
You ain't never made that kind of money
at your shitty-ass lemonade stand.


1167
01:06:07.637 --> 01:06:11.600
Fuck ya'll. That white man
was creating jobs in the Black community.


1168
01:06:11.683 --> 01:06:13.685
[laughter]

1169
01:06:17.564 --> 01:06:20.025
I like people in their 20s and 30s.
They just don't get it yet.


1170
01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:23.070
People in their 20s and 30s,
"Let's get fucked up!


1171
01:06:23.153 --> 01:06:26.114
You want to get fucked up?
Yeah! Let's get fucked up!"


1172
01:06:26.198 --> 01:06:29.284
No, I don't want
to get fucked up. I don't.


1173
01:06:29.368 --> 01:06:30.952
No, it's not fun.

1174
01:06:31.036 --> 01:06:35.165
I'm in my 50s.
I only feel good, like, two days a month.


1175
01:06:35.248 --> 01:06:36.917
[laughter]

1176
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.127
Why would I want to
fuck up one of those?

1177
01:06:40.545 --> 01:06:42.422
If I wanna get
fucked up at my age,

1178
01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:44.341
I'll eat some cheese, you know?

1179
01:06:44.424 --> 01:06:46.009
[laughter, applause]

1180
01:06:46.093 --> 01:06:47.803
[retches]

1181
01:06:47.886 --> 01:06:49.638
[groans]

1182
01:06:49.721 --> 01:06:51.765
What kind of cheese was that?

1183
01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:55.143
Camembert with truffle flakes?

1184
01:06:55.227 --> 01:06:57.354
All right, it was worth it. But fuck.

1185
01:06:57.979 --> 01:06:59.398
I'm fucked up now.

1186
01:07:00.774 --> 01:07:02.943
My wife, for Christmas,
she got me a gym membership.


1187
01:07:03.026 --> 01:07:04.986
"Thank you, honey. 
Oh, thank you."

1188
01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:10.742
I know. I went over there, and I saw
these old guys. They were working out.


1189
01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:12.828
And um, they were ripped.

1190
01:07:13.578 --> 01:07:15.455
But it looks weird, you know?

1191
01:07:16.915 --> 01:07:18.333
I don't wanna get ripped, you know?

1192
01:07:18.417 --> 01:07:21.086
I just don't wanna look
like a complete piece of shit.


1193
01:07:21.169 --> 01:07:24.131
You know? That's the goal.
Give me that personal trainer.


1194
01:07:24.214 --> 01:07:26.842
The not complete piece of shit
personal trainer.


1195
01:07:26.925 --> 01:07:30.387
So I'm looking at these old guys,
and they're, like, ripped, you know?


1196
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:33.056
But it looked weird.
Something was off.


1197
01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.559
I was like, "What, is it the--"
Then I figured it out.


1198
01:07:35.642 --> 01:07:38.061
You're not supposed to be ripped
when you're old.


1199
01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:41.189
'Cause your skin gets stretched too thin.

1200
01:07:41.273 --> 01:07:43.108
It's like, "Look how ripped I am."

1201
01:07:43.191 --> 01:07:45.193
"Yeah, but I can see your heart.

1202
01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.029
Put on your shirt.

1203
01:07:48.738 --> 01:07:50.157
You're grossing me out."

1204
01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:56.455
But uh, my favorite part
of being married is my wife deciding


1205
01:07:56.538 --> 01:07:58.123
what I don't need anymore, you know?

1206
01:07:58.206 --> 01:08:01.626
[in Mexican accent] "This doesn't fit.
This looks like shit. Can't wear this."


1207
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.004
She's not Mexican.
It's just more fun to do that voice.


1208
01:08:04.087 --> 01:08:06.923
[laughs] More fun. More fun.

1209
01:08:07.007 --> 01:08:11.303
She could be Mexican. I'm not sure.
I have my suspicions. I'm not 100% sure.


1210
01:08:11.386 --> 01:08:14.473
"You don't wear this anymore.
This doesn't fit anymore."


1211
01:08:14.556 --> 01:08:18.351
My wife threw away all my sweatpants.
Threw it away.


1212
01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:22.606
-"Why'd you throw away all my sweatpants?"
-"Because sweatpants, they lie to you.


1213
01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:24.816
They are liars, the sweatpants.

1214
01:08:25.317 --> 01:08:27.694
You don't know how fat you're getting.

1215
01:08:27.777 --> 01:08:31.781
You don't know. 'Til one day,
both strings just disappear.


1216
01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:35.035
Then you are a fat fuck.

1217
01:08:36.119 --> 01:08:38.163
It's too late. 
I threw them away."

1218
01:08:41.374 --> 01:08:44.920
She's right, though. Let me tell you,
if you're in your 50s, and you're a guy,


1219
01:08:45.003 --> 01:08:48.131
it's dangerous wearing sweatpants.
It is. It's dangerous.


1220
01:08:48.215 --> 01:08:50.926
Because it's way too easy
to just whip out your dick.


1221
01:08:53.053 --> 01:08:55.263
I found myself whipping out my dick.

1222
01:08:55.347 --> 01:08:57.349
I wasn't even halfway to the bathroom.

1223
01:09:01.353 --> 01:09:03.813
And then I get distracted by something.

1224
01:09:11.696 --> 01:09:14.741
Then I hear my wife yelling,
"What are you doing with your dick out?


1225
01:09:14.824 --> 01:09:16.785
You're not even in the bathroom yet."

1226
01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.703
I was like, "Hey…

1227
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.790
I didn't even realize
the Olive Garden had a salad bar."


1228
01:09:21.873 --> 01:09:23.875
[laughter]

1229
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:28.255
I don't know.
I'm not a good feminist, though.


1230
01:09:28.338 --> 01:09:30.298
I'm still listening to R. Kelly.

1231
01:09:32.634 --> 01:09:36.346
I kind of forgot how good that music was
'til that documentary came out.


1232
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:41.059
People are freaking out. Like,
"What are we gonna do with his music?"


1233
01:09:41.142 --> 01:09:45.105
I'm like, "Look, obviously, I'm not gonna
support anything new that he puts out.


1234
01:09:45.897 --> 01:09:47.566
Unless it's great."

1235
01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:49.651
[chuckles]

1236
01:09:50.569 --> 01:09:53.780
Honestly, though, all his old music,
that's all grandfathered in.


1237
01:09:56.449 --> 01:09:58.368
Look, if you're not listening
to that music,


1238
01:09:58.451 --> 01:10:00.996
it's like
he fucked those kids for nothing.


1239

Hey guys, look, you… [laughs]

01:10:09.504 --> 01:10:13.300
You may not support the war,
but you always support the soldiers.

Oh man!

1244

Those girls served this country. [laughs]

1245
01:10:22.517 --> 01:10:25.478
Yeah, I think they should have
the same rights as veterans.


1246
01:10:26.354 --> 01:10:30.150
They should be able to go
to school for free, board the plane first.


1247
01:10:31.109 --> 01:10:34.237
Why are we letting
your grandmothers board the plane first?


1248
01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:36.531
They've done nothing for us.

1249
01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:40.327
Those girls are the reason why
we have the remix to "Ignition."

[cheering, laughter]

the documentary, though?


1252

[audience] Yeah!

1253
01:10:49.586 --> 01:10:52.422
I didn't know he was having sex with kids
and keeping them in his house.


1254
01:10:52.505 --> 01:10:55.592
You're like, "Kelly, catch and release.

1255
01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:00.847
You can't have the whole
JV basketball team in your basement."


1256
01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.643
They're like,
"We're losing a lot of games.

Where are the point guards?"

1258
01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:10.148
I don't know. I think
he was just having sex with kids


1259
01:11:10.231 --> 01:11:12.359
'cause they were
at the same reading level.

Look, I don't care
if you guys laugh at that or not. [laughs]


1261
01:11:21.117 --> 01:11:23.161
I was ignored my whole childhood.

1262
01:11:23.662 --> 01:11:26.915
Yeah. I would've loved
to have been at R. Kelly's house.


1263
01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:31.961
Oh my God. There would've been
so many kids to play with.


1264
01:11:34.172 --> 01:11:38.093
Oh man. What a sick game of tag
that would have been. [laughs]


1265
01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.806
I don't know though, R. Kelly's a guy
that put out a song


1266
01:11:42.889 --> 01:11:46.142
called "I Believe I Can Fly."
Like, if he thought he could fly,


1267
01:11:46.226 --> 01:11:49.562
he definitely thought he could
fuck some kids and get away with it.


1268
01:11:54.234 --> 01:11:55.360
The harmonium.

1269

[mimics explosion]

1271
01:12:01.408 --> 01:12:04.619
Oh man. The harmonium
is such a depressing instrument.


1272
01:12:05.578 --> 01:12:09.207
And you can't hate it also.
It looks like an old uncle with asthma.

"Yeah, let's do drugs, bro. Come on."


1275
01:12:17.549 --> 01:12:20.468
Harmonium is like,
"If you can just drop me to the temple…"

[audience cheers]

It's the first time someone got excited…

1278
01:12:30.353 --> 01:12:32.939
by seeing someone
approach a harmonium. That never--


1279
01:12:33.022 --> 01:12:35.108
It's usually the soundtrack of a funeral.

1280
01:12:36.067 --> 01:12:37.277
The harmonium is great.

1281
01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.529
It doesn't need electricity,
by the way, to run.


1282
01:12:39.612 --> 01:12:41.114
It's eco-friendly, so…

1283
01:12:41.781 --> 01:12:45.702
It's also poverty-proof.
You can't complain to the government.


1284
01:12:45.785 --> 01:12:49.038
You can't be like, "We can't pursue arts
'cause there's no electricity at home."


1285
01:12:49.122 --> 01:12:51.666
The government is like, "Harmonium."

1286
01:12:52.876 --> 01:12:56.629
Western instruments use electricity,
like electric guitar, electric piano.

"Ma'am, can I use an electric guitar?"
She said, "No. You'll get shocked."

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.259
What?

1289
01:13:01.342 --> 01:13:04.012
And uh, it's--it's also very interesting
how it's made.


1290
01:13:04.095 --> 01:13:06.014
It's made out of wood and depression.

1291
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:12.270
So-- And it's the only instrument
which sounds like the word "no."


1292
01:13:14.439 --> 01:13:16.357
Like it's "no" in every scale.

-Which is why I'm gonna get fucked.


1332

We're animals.
We're not people fucking each other.

-And it's consent and everything.

01:15:42.587 --> 01:15:45.924
-It doesn't matter.
-No. This has no consequence.


1341
01:15:46.007 --> 01:15:48.593
It will be recorded forever,
so if you lose, everybody knows.

Everybody knows I'm shit
