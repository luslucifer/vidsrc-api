Prissy, that's enough.

Bless us, O Lord,
for this food we are about to receive.


67
00:08:48.058 --> 00:08:52.896
And we thank thee, O Lord,
for saving us from the storm.

[man] Lord, may the storm
you brought upon us

leave us repentant.

70
00:08:59.027 --> 00:09:03.239
Let those of us who survive
give thanks to your goodness.


71
00:09:03.948 --> 00:09:07.660
Soften the hearts of those who oppress us.

72
00:09:08.328 --> 00:09:13.666
Spare us the violence and hatred
that visits our daily lives.


73
00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:17.420
Deliver our young from cigarettes,

74
00:09:18.171 --> 00:09:21.382
from dancing, from drinking,

75
00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:24.636
from lipstick and flapper skirts.

76
00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:28.264
Yes, Lord, deliver us from all evil.

77
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.851
And finally, O Lord,

78
00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:36.856
help us to live our lives
as you would have us live them.

Look, I don't wanna talk about it.

103
00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:08.281
Oh, come on, Newt. 
Big Mabel got you, huh?

104
00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:10.909
How did it feel, Newt?

110
00:11:28.718 --> 00:11:32.472
-You gonna do it again, Newt?
-Oh, shut up! I told you everything.

Get the lead out.

-Feel like apples, Beansy?
-I could eat some, I guess.


118
00:11:56.996 --> 00:11:58.206
How about you, Jappy?

119
00:11:59.123 --> 00:12:01.793
-It's okay with me.
-Well, then, let's go.

Oh! You'll pay for this!

That old buzzard pushed his luck too far.

What do you think they'll do?

Don't give a damn what they gonna do.

129
00:13:13.323 --> 00:13:15.742
You all saw him hit me
with that whip first.


130
00:13:16.784 --> 00:13:19.162
You didn't have to beat him like that
after he was down.

Well, fellas, ain't that something?

over one of his own gang.

134
00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:31.341
Mr. Kiner ain't that bad.

135
00:13:31.424 --> 00:13:34.719
He gives us just as much work
as he does white folks.


136
00:13:34.802 --> 00:13:37.347
How about all that cornmeal
he gave Beansy's pa last winter?


137
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.391
To hell with last winter. 
He hit me today.

138
00:13:40.475 --> 00:13:42.101
Wasn't we stealing his apples?

139
00:13:42.185 --> 00:13:46.314
Look, Winger, all I wanna know is,
you with us or not?

I'm always with the fellas here.

141

You don't like nothing I do, Winger.
Nothing. You're always against me.

Yeah, you know what I mean.
You know exactly what I mean.


144
00:14:11.255 --> 00:14:13.508
Just keep it up.
You'll see what I'm getting at.

00:15:39.469 --> 00:15:42.472
Newt might have stole apples,
but he sure didn't hit Jake Kiner.


162
00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:44.223
Well, Mary Kiner says different.

163
00:15:44.307 --> 00:15:46.517
And Jake is damn near dead
in the hospital!


164
00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:48.603
You watch your tongue, Kirky.

165
00:15:53.232 --> 00:15:55.234
Run and get your papa from the barn.

166
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:58.404
[engine starts]

167
00:15:58.488 --> 00:16:00.781
-[boys chuckling]
-[boy] The water was fine today.


168
00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:02.575
-[boy 2] Boy, oh, boy.
-[boy 3] Yeah.


169
00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:04.410
Wonder what Marcus is doing?

170
00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:07.246
[boy 2] I don't know.
He's a sorehead anyway.


171
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.290
[boys chuckling]

172
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.752
[boy 2] You wanna go in again?

173
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.718
-[man] Roll again!
-That Marcus cut my pants off.


174
00:16:20.801 --> 00:16:23.012
Look what he did.
Did the same thing to mine.


175
00:16:23.095 --> 00:16:24.805
-[chuckles]
-Come on, Silas.


176
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:27.225
-Here it is, Tuck.
-We gon' get drunk —


177
00:16:27.308 --> 00:16:28.851
-Oh!
-Good one.


178
00:16:28.935 --> 00:16:30.186
All yours.

179
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.271
Fifty. I got you.

180
00:16:33.105 --> 00:16:36.400
Boy, they sure are having a good old time
at that crap game.


181
00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:42.740
[engine off]

182
00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:54.126
[men chattering]

183
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.547
[Silas] Eight a-rollin'. A beautiful,
gallopin' horse. Come on, dice!


184
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.007
[chattering continues]

185
00:17:03.177 --> 00:17:05.263
-Come on, Tuck!
-Everybody down. Let's go.


186
00:17:05.346 --> 00:17:06.472
Knock 'em back.

187
00:17:06.556 --> 00:17:10.017
[men chattering, exclaiming]

188
00:17:10.768 --> 00:17:12.353
Hey, there's Kirky.

189
00:17:14.272 --> 00:17:17.275
[men continue chattering]

190
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.115
Tuck! Tuck! Kirky's coming!

191
00:17:30.121 --> 00:17:31.747
[Newt] Run, Tuck! Run!

192
00:17:36.294 --> 00:17:37.795
[boys whimpering]

193
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.174
-[Kirky] Stop, damn it, or I'll shoot!
-[gunshot]


194
00:18:05.239 --> 00:18:07.325
You didn't have to shoot Tuck.

195
00:18:08.951 --> 00:18:11.787
Well, now you can see
what happens to criminals,


196
00:18:11.871 --> 00:18:14.498
especially the kind that goes around
beatin' up on white folks


197
00:18:14.582 --> 00:18:16.042
and running from the law.

198
00:18:17.043 --> 00:18:18.961
Tuck didn't beat up nobody.

199
00:18:19.795 --> 00:18:22.048
No, but you young hyenas did, didn't you?

200
00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:23.299
Huh?

201
00:18:25.134 --> 00:18:28.596
Now, where's that nigger Marcus?
Jake said he did the dirty work.


202
00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:30.348
Is that so?

203
00:18:30.431 --> 00:18:32.433
What do you mean, "nigger"?

204
00:18:33.351 --> 00:18:36.437
I'm asking you if he's the one
who did the beatin', boy.


205
00:18:38.439 --> 00:18:41.651
Y'all better tell the truth,
or I'm gonna lock all of you up.


206
00:18:42.568 --> 00:18:44.862
Mr. Kiner was beating him first.

207
00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:47.573
Kiner shoulda kilt him.
That's what he shoulda done.


208
00:18:51.744 --> 00:18:53.663
Now, y'all stay here.

209
00:18:53.746 --> 00:18:56.666
I'm gonna get some help
and drag that criminal out there.


210
00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.294
And don't you all try escaping
like he did.


211
00:19:06.342 --> 00:19:09.428
[Kirky] Hold it! Right in there.
Don't go any further, Bob.


212
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.848
That's it. About in there.
This way a little bit.


213
00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:15.726
-You see anything?
-No.


214
00:19:21.399 --> 00:19:23.526
What's the matter now? 
You giving up?

215
00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:27.196
-You don't think we can get him dragging?
-I know we can't. Haven't had any luck.


216
00:19:34.578 --> 00:19:36.831
Hey. Y'all come down here a minute.

217
00:19:37.581 --> 00:19:39.667
Bet he wants us to dive for Tuck.

218
00:19:40.876 --> 00:19:43.462
Come here. I wanna
talk to you a second.

219
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.720
| just figured a way
| can go easy on you fellas,


220
00:19:50.803 --> 00:19:54.223
and you make yourself, uh,
two bits apiece besides.


221
00:19:54.306 --> 00:19:56.058
How's that?

222
00:19:56.142 --> 00:19:58.227
All you gotta do
is dive down in them shallows


223
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.813
and undo Tuck's body
so's we can haul him in.


224
00:20:00.896 --> 00:20:03.315
-Not for no two bits, we ain't.
-[chuckles]


225
00:20:03.399 --> 00:20:05.693
Listen, I got a lot
on you kids. I can...

226
00:20:07.611 --> 00:20:09.196
Okay, half a buck.

227
00:20:12.324 --> 00:20:13.993
No less than six bits apiece.

228
00:20:14.076 --> 00:20:16.746
Look, I'm doing you a favor.
| could lock you up.


229
00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:23.586
Okay, okay. Six bits. Six bits.

230
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:24.920
After.

231
00:20:26.255 --> 00:20:28.674
Go back out. They're gonna dive for him.

232
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:32.803
Go back out over the spot.

233
00:20:35.639 --> 00:20:38.726
The water's pretty dirty. I don't know
if they'll be able to find him.


234
00:20:47.526 --> 00:20:48.611
| found him.

235
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.364
[cheering, laughing]

236
00:20:52.448 --> 00:20:56.076
Here's the rope.
Take that down and tie it on to him.


237
00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:07.087
There it is. They got him.

238
00:21:22.937 --> 00:21:24.939
[men applauding, cheering]

239
00:21:25.022 --> 00:21:26.982
Them little niggers is good swimmers.

240
00:21:27.983 --> 00:21:29.735
What about our money?

241
00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:31.362
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:21:35.366 --> 00:21:36.951
Six bits apiece.

243
00:21:37.535 --> 00:21:39.328
We're short a quarter.

244
00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:51.674
A colored lady and her son
brought these flowers.


245
00:21:51.757 --> 00:21:53.133
You wanna see 'em?

246
00:21:54.343 --> 00:21:57.096
Uh, that'll be all right.
Ask them to come in.


247
00:22:08.107 --> 00:22:10.109
Hello, Jake. Mary.

248
00:22:10.192 --> 00:22:11.527
-Sarah.
-Sarah.


249
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.113
I'm sorry about what happened, Jake.

250
00:22:14.196 --> 00:22:16.824
We didn't think Marcus would do
something like that.


251
00:22:17.449 --> 00:22:18.909
Mama baked you a pie.

252
00:22:20.327 --> 00:22:22.746
Oh. Hmm.

253
00:22:27.376 --> 00:22:31.130
That Savage boy is gonna get the rest
of you in trouble. You watch my word.


254
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.969
Ain't there something else
you want to tell Mr. Kiner?


255
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.014
I'd like to work the summer for you
for nothing.


256
00:22:40.097 --> 00:22:43.017
-Sorta make up for things.
-You mean that, Newt?


257
00:22:43.726 --> 00:22:44.977
Yes, Sir.

258
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.317
All right, Newt.
I'll be expecting you weekends.


259
00:22:52.651 --> 00:22:55.029
Is Saturday and Friday all right?

260
00:22:55.112 --> 00:22:57.448
Mama's against Sunday workin'.

261
00:22:57.531 --> 00:22:59.617
And Sunday stealin'.

262
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.452
It's all right with me, son.

263
00:23:02.494 --> 00:23:04.788
Well, hello, Sarah. Newt.

264
00:23:04.872 --> 00:23:07.207
-Hello, Timothy.
-Evening, Doc.


265
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.376
You feeling better, Jake?

266
00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.378
Oh, fair to middlin', Timothy.

267
00:23:11.462 --> 00:23:12.922
We ought to be going, I guess.

268
00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:15.799
Thank you, Sarah,
for the flowers and the pie.


269
00:23:15.883 --> 00:23:18.260
-Goodbye, now.
-I'll give you a ride, Sarah.


270
00:23:18.344 --> 00:23:19.678
I'm going your way.

271
00:23:19.762 --> 00:23:21.639
All right, Timothy.

272
00:23:21.722 --> 00:23:23.182
I'll be back, Jake.

273
00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:26.727
Say, that pie looks awful good.

274
00:23:27.853 --> 00:23:29.980
Oughta be. It's my apples.

275
00:23:30.064 --> 00:23:31.857
[Mary chuckles] Oh, Jake.

276
00:23:33.943 --> 00:23:36.236
-Good night, Jack.
-Good night, Sarah.


277
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.225
Run, Tuck! Run!

278
00:24:07.434 --> 00:24:08.560
Tuck!

279
00:24:22.783 --> 00:24:25.077
Pull him up! Pull him up!

280
00:24:26.745 --> 00:24:28.789
Tuck! Tuck!

281
00:24:29.498 --> 00:24:31.125
Tuck! Tuck!

282
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:34.294
Son! Having bad dreams, Son?

283
00:24:38.048 --> 00:24:40.050
-Yeah, Mama.
-What about?


284
00:24:42.011 --> 00:24:43.846
About Captain Tuck.

285
00:24:45.597 --> 00:24:46.849
And death.

286
00:24:46.932 --> 00:24:49.601
Death's a long way from you, Son.

287
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.522
Tuck's gone. Resting in peace somewhere.

288
00:24:55.733 --> 00:24:58.777
| keep seeing him turning over and over
in the water.


289
00:24:58.861 --> 00:25:00.904
Tuck liked you, Son.

290
00:25:02.114 --> 00:25:04.408
He wouldn't hurt you, not even in death.

291
00:25:07.578 --> 00:25:09.621
I'm scared of death, Mama.

292
00:25:10.706 --> 00:25:12.124
I'm afraid of death.

293
00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:15.210
Go back to sleep, Son.

294
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:26.889
[hammering]

295
00:25:26.972 --> 00:25:29.725
Good morning, Mrs. Jefferson.
I'm Sarah Winger.


296
00:25:29.808 --> 00:25:31.518
Good morning. Pleased to meet you.

297
00:25:31.602 --> 00:25:35.064
Saw you in church Sunday.
This is my son, Newt.


298
00:25:35.147 --> 00:25:37.649
-My, what a nice-looking boy.
-[Newt] Hello.


299
00:25:37.733 --> 00:25:41.528
And this is my daughter, Arcella.
Say hello, Arcella darling.


300
00:25:41.612 --> 00:25:45.282
-Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Winger.
-Pleased to meet you, Arcella.


301
00:25:45.365 --> 00:25:47.951
-Coming to the picnic, I hope?
-Hope so.


302
00:25:48.035 --> 00:25:52.498
Arcella's starting piano lessons today.
We're going for sheet music.


303
00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:54.083
How nice.

304
00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:57.044
-It was an awful storm.
-Oh, it was just terrible.


305
00:25:57.127 --> 00:25:59.296
-Bye-bye.
-Just terrible.


306
00:26:17.022 --> 00:26:19.775
Judge, can I talk
to you for a minute?

307
00:26:21.151 --> 00:26:23.946
You ought to go easy on Marcus.

308
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:27.449
The fault is not so much with him
as it is his father.


309
00:26:28.408 --> 00:26:30.327
Poor boy grew up without a mother.

310
00:26:31.537 --> 00:26:35.040
No one's given him an ounce of love
since he's been born.


311
00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:39.670
Oughta be something we all could
get together and do for him.


312
00:26:40.963 --> 00:26:44.591
| can't send the father to the reformatory
for something the son did.


313
00:26:45.425 --> 00:26:48.637
It was a brutal
act by a brutal boy.

314
00:26:55.644 --> 00:26:58.897
-I just don't think that's the answer.

Oh, I see. You — You just met.

No, I'm just saying
that I think I should have a better mark.

Well, what you think and what I know
are miles apart.

Now, you got a C,
and a C it will stay.

And that brings me to another point.

| was going through your records
yesterday, and I was amazed to notice


511
00:43:38.229 --> 00:43:41.816
that you've signed up
for a college preparatory course.


512
00:43:41.899 --> 00:43:44.777
That's right. I plan on going to college.

513
00:43:44.861 --> 00:43:47.321
-Are you serious?
-Yes.


514
00:43:49.407 --> 00:43:51.492
Well, let me tell you something.

515
00:43:51.576 --> 00:43:53.995
Very few Negro students go to college.

516
00:43:54.787 --> 00:43:56.747
They just aren't college material.

517
00:43:56.831 --> 00:44:01.627
And the few who do go
wind up as cooks and porters in any case.


518
00:44:01.711 --> 00:44:04.755
Now, I just think
that's an awful waste of money and time.


519
00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:08.134
That's not gonna happen to me
whether I go to college or not.


520
00:44:08.217 --> 00:44:10.595
Now, Newton, don't get upset.

521
00:44:10.678 --> 00:44:12.847
I'm here to advise you.

522
00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.975
And I advise you
to take a general course.

523
00:44:16.058 --> 00:44:19.854
It'll be much easier for you
and wiser for you.


524
00:44:21.856 --> 00:44:24.859
You just hate us colored kids, don't you?

525
00:44:26.652 --> 00:44:27.737
Young man —

526
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.906
Well, we hate you too.

527
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.533
Every last one of us.

528
00:44:32.617 --> 00:44:37.163
Young man, you and I are going
to the principal's office right now.


529
00:44:37.246 --> 00:44:38.497
Come on.

530
00:44:45.171 --> 00:44:47.423
Newton, you sit right there and wait.

531
00:44:54.764 --> 00:44:56.849
Looks like you're in hot water.

532
00:44:56.933 --> 00:44:58.392
Looks that way.

533
00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.560
Newton, come in here.

534
00:45:49.944 --> 00:45:51.320
Sit right there.

535
00:45:53.698 --> 00:45:56.075
Miss McClintock tells me you sassed her.

536
00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.830
-Well —
-You accused me of downgrading you.


537
00:46:00.913 --> 00:46:02.456
That right, Newton?

538
00:46:04.166 --> 00:46:06.252
Well, that's not all there was to it.

539
00:46:07.545 --> 00:46:10.089
Well, out with it.
What are you trying to say?


540
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.467
Miss McClintock and |
don't see things the same way.


541
00:46:13.551 --> 00:46:15.469
Miss McClintock
happens to be your instructor


542
00:46:15.553 --> 00:46:17.972
as well as your guidance teacher.

543
00:46:18.055 --> 00:46:20.433
| just don't like the way
she wants to guide me.


544
00:46:20.516 --> 00:46:23.352
And that caused you to, uh,
tell her you hated her?


545
00:46:23.436 --> 00:46:26.314
-Well, I didn't say —
-Don't lie. You know you said it.


546
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:29.525
| didn't say I hated you alone.

547
00:46:29.608 --> 00:46:31.777
| said all the colored kids hate you.

548
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:33.654
And we do.

549
00:46:33.738 --> 00:46:37.742
-Why do you say such a thing?
-She's always telling us the same thing.


550
00:46:37.825 --> 00:46:41.078
"Don't go to college.
You're just gonna be porters and maids."


551
00:46:41.162 --> 00:46:42.830
Is this true, Miss McClintock?

552
00:46:42.913 --> 00:46:45.082
Do you tell the Negro students
such things?


553
00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:48.836
Mr. Hall, I have been class adviser here
for over 20 years.


554
00:46:48.919 --> 00:46:51.422
| tell them
what I was instructed to tell them.


555
00:46:51.505 --> 00:46:53.132
Who? Who instructed you?

556
00:46:53.215 --> 00:46:55.926
Mr. Hornsby, the principal before you.

557
00:46:57.094 --> 00:46:59.638
Oh, I see, I see. Hmm.

558
00:46:59.722 --> 00:47:01.140
Miss McClintock —

559
00:47:02.016 --> 00:47:03.351
Well, that'll be all.

560
00:47:04.226 --> 00:47:06.062
| would like to talk to Newton.

561
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:14.862
Why don't you sit over here?

562
00:47:20.743 --> 00:47:22.870
To explain Miss McClintock, uh...

563
00:47:24.872 --> 00:47:29.418
one would have to go back to a tragic time
before either you or I was born.


564
00:47:30.836 --> 00:47:34.507
And although she must share the blame
for this awful wrong,


565
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.926
Miss McClintock
is somewhat a victim herself.


566
00:47:37.009 --> 00:47:42.181
She thought it was right because it was
a situation that existed for so long.


567
00:47:45.351 --> 00:47:47.353
Mr. Hornsby is more to blame than she.

568
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.610
But then, so is his father.

569
00:47:55.694 --> 00:47:56.987
And my father.

570
00:47:58.531 --> 00:48:00.074
And millions of others.

571
00:48:02.868 --> 00:48:04.036
Now,

572
00:48:04.912 --> 00:48:08.207
there are still things at this school
that I don't like, Newton —


573
00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:12.711
the fact that you boys can't play
on the football and basketball teams,


574
00:48:12.795 --> 00:48:15.423
that you can't attend
the school dances and parties.


575
00:48:16.132 --> 00:48:19.468
If it were left up to me
and a few others who care,


576
00:48:19.552 --> 00:48:21.011
all this would stop.

577
00:48:21.095 --> 00:48:24.265
But there are still
too many Mr. Hornsbys left around.


578
00:48:26.767 --> 00:48:27.852
But...

579
00:48:28.686 --> 00:48:31.814
well, maybe someday. [chuckles]

580
00:48:34.692 --> 00:48:38.112
[sighs] You can go now, Newton.

581
00:48:38.195 --> 00:48:41.866
| intend to have a long talk
with Miss McClintock


582
00:48:41.949 --> 00:48:44.952
and a few of the other teachers
when the board meets next.


583
00:48:46.454 --> 00:48:49.707
I'm sure that their attitudes
and thinking...


584
00:48:51.709 --> 00:48:53.294
they'll be different.

585
00:48:56.088 --> 00:48:57.423
Oh, Newton,

586
00:48:58.674 --> 00:49:01.760
you're to show Miss McClintock
the highest respect.


587
00:49:01.844 --> 00:49:02.845
Hmm?

588
00:49:25.075 --> 00:49:27.328
Hello, Newt. Jappy.

590
00:49:30.247 --> 00:49:32.708
Oh. I thought she'd be home by now.

We had to stay late.

592
00:49:37.004 --> 00:49:40.466
Oh, she said something about
going to the library before it closed.


593
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:44.178
Oh, I see.
Well, I'll tell her you boys stopped by.


594
00:49:46.555 --> 00:49:47.681
Oh, Newt?

595
00:49:49.225 --> 00:49:51.268
Come here a minute.

596
00:49:51.352 --> 00:49:53.270
| thought I ought to tell you.

597
00:49:53.354 --> 00:49:56.565
Arcella's birthday
is the 27th of next month.


598
00:49:56.649 --> 00:49:59.193
-Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
-Okay.

[door shuts]

600
00:50:05.157 --> 00:50:07.409
Arcella's sure enough at the library.

601
00:50:07.493 --> 00:50:09.495
What's it to you where she's at?

602
00:50:09.578 --> 00:50:11.705
It's okay, it's okay. I just asked.

603

| gotta go.

604
00:50:26.303 --> 00:50:27.805
Hello, Newt.

605

Hello, Arcella.

606
00:50:30.057 --> 00:50:32.268
You wanna go for a little walk?

607
00:50:32.351 --> 00:50:33.394
No.

608

I'm sorry.

some homework and a few things.

No.

No.

You wanna go to the show tomorrow?

614
00:50:53.205 --> 00:50:55.082
I'm sorry, Newt. I can't.

615
00:50:57.501 --> 00:50:59.086
Is something wrong?

616
00:51:00.129 --> 00:51:01.171
Wrong?

617
00:51:02.214 --> 00:51:05.134
No. Why did you say that, anyway?

618
00:51:07.094 --> 00:51:09.513

[engine stops]

622
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.089
Hiya, Son.

623
00:51:47.301 --> 00:51:50.137
Nobody told me you was gettin' out today.

624
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:55.142
You his old man?

625
00:51:55.225 --> 00:51:56.518
That's right.

626
00:51:56.602 --> 00:51:58.354
You have to sign this here paper.

627

-What's all this for?
-He's on probation.


628

We gang up on the other three guys
and let Newt and Jappy win,


830

He's got gallons of it.

Jake Kiner's dead, and you killed him.

Jake's dead?

Why don't you just tell me why you did it.

You must be loony.
Why'd I do somethin' like that?


976
01:19:07.898 --> 01:19:11.318
Should've asked yourself that before
you clobbered him with that crowbar.


977
01:19:11.402 --> 01:19:14.280
Crowbar? What crowbar?
| ain't seen no crowbar!

-Why don't you tell me the truth?

Did Mary Kiner take it hard?

983
01:19:44.476 --> 01:19:47.688
Yep. Saddest funeral service
I've ever seen.


984

Poor woman's loaded down with grief.

01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:52.943
Sure glad a black man didn't do it.

Yeah?

989
01:20:20.929 --> 01:20:24.975
What did Papa mean by, "There'd be trouble
if a Negro had killed Mr. Kiner"?


990
01:20:25.059 --> 01:20:26.310
Meant just what he said.

991
01:20:26.393 --> 01:20:30.356
It could be real trouble, like they had
over in Bartsville a couple of years back.


992
01:20:30.439 --> 01:20:32.983
Freddie Sears shot a white man
who hit his sister.

What happened?

994
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:39.948
Well, the whites lynched Freddie
and burned down half the Negro homes.


995
01:20:41.658 --> 01:20:43.869
I'm glad you don't know nothing about it.

That way you don't have to
open your mouth. Understand?

01:20:46.789 --> 01:20:48.123
Yeah.

The witnesses and brutal evidence

1005
01:21:16.235 --> 01:21:19.863
will bring home to you
more than any statement of mine


1006
01:21:19.947 --> 01:21:22.324
the vileness of this offense

1007
01:21:22.408 --> 01:21:25.494
against heaven and all humanity.

1008
01:21:27.663 --> 01:21:31.458
And there,
gentlemen and ladies of the jury,


1009
01:21:32.042 --> 01:21:33.919
there sits the beast who is responsible —

1010
01:21:34.002 --> 01:21:36.797
Your Honor, I object to such reference
to the defendant.


1011
01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.966
[judge] Objection sustained.

1012
01:21:39.049 --> 01:21:41.093
Watch your language, Counselor.

1013
01:21:41.176 --> 01:21:42.761
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1014
01:21:46.807 --> 01:21:50.853
We intend to prove that the defendant did,

1015
01:21:50.936 --> 01:21:53.564
with premeditation and willfulness,

1016
01:21:54.314 --> 01:21:57.609
murder the deceased with this crowbar.

1017
01:21:59.111 --> 01:22:02.406
Circumstantial evidence
isn't always enough.


1018
01:22:04.658 --> 01:22:07.870
We beg you to judge
this defendant's guilt or innocence


1019
01:22:07.953 --> 01:22:11.999
solely upon the events, uh,
presented in this case.


1020
01:22:14.835 --> 01:22:19.548
With that, I place the fate
of the defendant in your hands.


1021
01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:21.800
Thank you.

1022

late start, court will adjourn until 1:00.


1023
01:22:27.389 --> 01:22:31.310
We can expect to hear from the state's
witnesses at that time, Counsel?


1024
01:22:31.393 --> 01:22:33.103
We shall be ready, Your Honor.

1025

-Court is dismissed.

[man 2 chuckles]
Old Silas really jumped


1030
01:22:57.044 --> 01:22:59.254
when McCormack slammed that crowbar
on the table.


1031
01:22:59.338 --> 01:23:01.465
[man] Silas ain't got a sucker's chance.

1032
01:23:01.548 --> 01:23:03.091
What else did you see,

1033
01:23:03.175 --> 01:23:06.345
other than the deceased and the defendant
lying on the floor?


1034
01:23:07.346 --> 01:23:11.934
A hoe and a whip
and that crowbar la yin' over there.


1035
01:23:12.017 --> 01:23:14.102
It was between Jake and Silas.

1036
01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.231
What else do you recall?

1037
01:23:17.814 --> 01:23:22.402
He was ea yin', "I'm gonna get my money
from that old skinflint or die tr yin'


1038
01:23:23.946 --> 01:23:25.948
and something about, "Over my dead body."

1039
01:23:26.031 --> 01:23:28.492
To whom was he saying this?

1040
01:23:28.575 --> 01:23:30.702
To Booker Savage in Chappie Logan's place.

1041
01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:33.539
[McCormack] Thank you, young lady.
That will be all.


1042
01:23:33.622 --> 01:23:38.085
He said he was goin' back for
his day's pay. He told me that, all right.


1043
01:23:38.168 --> 01:23:40.462
Did he seem angry?

1044
01:23:40.546 --> 01:23:42.756
Oh, he was fussin' some.

1045
01:23:44.383 --> 01:23:45.926
Thank you. That will be all.

-Mama, I got something to tell you.
-What's troubling you, Son?


1049
01:24:24.172 --> 01:24:26.508
Silas didn't kill Mr. Kiner.

[Sarah] Go on, Son. Finish it.

1053

1054
01:24:42.691 --> 01:24:45.444
-Go on.
-And then Mrs. Kiner came in.


1055
01:24:45.527 --> 01:24:47.904
She was screaming and everything.

1056
01:24:48.864 --> 01:24:51.116
And then she went out,

1057
01:24:51.199 --> 01:24:53.160

1058

This is incredible.

1060
01:25:02.586 --> 01:25:04.880
Newt, have you told
anyone else about this?


1061
01:25:04.963 --> 01:25:06.423
Just Mama and Papa.

1062
01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:11.136
Well, Sarah, Jack,

1063
01:25:11.219 --> 01:25:13.930
it would be wrong for me
as the judge in this case


1064
01:25:14.014 --> 01:25:15.641
to divulge this information.

1065
01:25:15.724 --> 01:25:17.100
You'll have to do it.

1066
01:25:17.184 --> 01:25:20.771
The man who should get this information
is Harley Davis, Silas's attorney.


1067
01:25:21.438 --> 01:25:24.274
-Are you willing to do that?
-If that's what you want.


1068
01:25:25.692 --> 01:25:28.487
Now, Newton here will have to
take the stand and testify.


1069
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:31.907
It's going to be rough on the boy,
but there's simply no other way.


1070
01:25:36.745 --> 01:25:40.874
| think you'd better go and have a talk
with Mr. Davis just as soon as possible.


1071
01:25:40.957 --> 01:25:43.585
He's staying
at Jenny Brighton's boardinghouse.


1072
01:25:49.466 --> 01:25:50.967
Thank you, Judge.

1073
01:25:54.888 --> 01:25:55.889
Jack.

1074
01:25:57.432 --> 01:26:00.519
Could I speak to you and Sarah
for just a minute?


1075
01:26:00.602 --> 01:26:02.145
Go ahead, Son.

1076
01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:09.152
-About Chauncey and the Jefferson girl.
-[door shuts]


1077
01:26:09.236 --> 01:26:13.532
I'll personally see to it
that Chauncey takes care of the baby.


1078

I..o

[sighs] I'm sorry.

1080
01:26:22.999 --> 01:26:24.960
Mr. Davis, you may call your witness.

1081
01:26:25.043 --> 01:26:26.628
Thank you, Your Honor.

1082
01:26:28.046 --> 01:26:30.006
Would Newton Winger please take the stand?

1083

[spectators murmuring]

1084

[murmuring subsides]

1085
01:27:01.663 --> 01:27:04.207
Please stand and raise your right hand.

1086
01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:08.003
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,


1087
01:27:08.086 --> 01:27:10.005
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?


1088
01:27:10.088 --> 01:27:11.882
-Yes, sir.
-Be seated, please.


1089
01:27:17.053 --> 01:27:19.306
Would you tell the court your full name?

1090
01:27:19.389 --> 01:27:22.142
Newt — Newton Buchanan Winger.

1091
01:27:22.225 --> 01:27:24.978
-How old are you, Newton?
-Fifteen.


1092
01:27:26.688 --> 01:27:29.399
Would you speak
just a little louder, Newt?


1093
01:27:30.734 --> 01:27:33.111
Did you know the deceased, Jake Kiner?

1094
01:27:33.987 --> 01:27:34.988
Yes, Sir.

1095
01:27:35.071 --> 01:27:37.407
And what was the last day
you worked for him?


1096
01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:38.658
June the 14th.

1097
01:27:38.742 --> 01:27:42.162
-On the day that Mr. Kiner was killed?
-Yes, sir.


1098
01:27:42.245 --> 01:27:47.000
Now, Newt, I want you to tell the court
in your own words exactly what happened.


1099
01:27:47.083 --> 01:27:50.212
Well, I was eating my lunch
up in the hayloft,


1100
01:27:50.295 --> 01:27:52.047
and I heard some noise down below.

1101
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:54.007
What kind of noise?

1102
01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:55.967
Somebody was rippin' off the door

1103
01:27:56.051 --> 01:27:59.971
to where Mr. Kiner keeps his peach brandy
and cider and stuff with a crowbar.


1104
01:28:00.055 --> 01:28:01.681
And what happened then?

1105
01:28:01.765 --> 01:28:05.352
Mr. Kiner and Mr. Newhall came in,
fussin' about something.


1106
01:28:05.435 --> 01:28:07.813
Mr. Kiner got real mad.

1107
01:28:07.896 --> 01:28:10.899
He started hitting Mr. Newhall
with his whip handle.


1108
01:28:10.982 --> 01:28:13.401
Mr. Newhall tried to grab the hoe,

1109
01:28:13.485 --> 01:28:16.404
but Mr. Kiner knocked him down
before he could get a blow in.


1110
01:28:16.488 --> 01:28:19.741
-[spectators murmuring]
-And then he saw this other man.


1111
01:28:19.825 --> 01:28:22.911
But the other man hit him in the head
with the crowbar,


1112
01:28:22.994 --> 01:28:25.413
and he kept beating after he was down.

1113

[spectators gasping, murmuring]

1114
01:28:27.499 --> 01:28:30.377
Newt, I want you to tell the court

1115
01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:33.713
why you didn't come forth
with this information before.


1116
01:28:36.258 --> 01:28:39.511
-Well, I was scared.
-Scared of what?

Now, Newt, I want you to
look around this room very carefully


1120
01:28:49.396 --> 01:28:51.606
and tell the court
if you see the man,

1121

the one who broke into the room
and beat Mr. Kiner.

Well, Counsel,

1149
01:30:49.975 --> 01:30:51.393
it looks like your move.

1150
01:30:52.435 --> 01:30:53.478
Your Honor,

1151
01:30:53.561 --> 01:30:58.233
in view of all that has taken place here
before us today,


1152

the state wishes to withdraw all charges
against the defendant, Silas Newhall,

if the court will permit.

1154
01:31:06.408 --> 01:31:07.867
The court will permit.

1155
01:31:09.953 --> 01:31:13.999
| now order the defendant released.
This case is closed.


1156
01:31:15.333 --> 01:31:20.422
But I would like to say this.

1157
01:31:20.505 --> 01:31:22.549
We have a judicial system in this country

1158
01:31:22.632 --> 01:31:25.635
that gives every man the right
to a fair trial when accused.


1159
01:31:26.928 --> 01:31:29.347
You who shouted so viciously

1160
01:31:29.431 --> 01:31:31.349
frightened Booker Savage
out of that right.


1161
01:31:31.433 --> 01:31:33.101
You pulled the trigger.

1162
01:31:36.938 --> 01:31:39.399
You decided
that he had killed a white man,


1163
01:31:40.608 --> 01:31:43.737
So you judged him, and you executed him.

1164
01:31:44.446 --> 01:31:46.698
Have you forgotten that
it was a black boy

1165
01:31:46.781 --> 01:31:50.368
who saved a white man's life here
just a few minutes ago?


1166
01:31:50.452 --> 01:31:52.662
It took courage to do that.

1167
01:31:52.746 --> 01:31:55.248
A lot more courage than you have.

1168
01:31:56.291 --> 01:32:00.003
It was what he feared from you
that kept him from revealing what he knew.


1169
01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.798
And your actions justified that fear.

1170
01:32:05.592 --> 01:32:08.219
This moment should haunt
your minds forever.


1171
01:32:10.472 --> 01:32:12.432

A brave thing.


1174
01:32:32.619 --> 01:32:34.537
We're both thankful to you.

1175
01:32:35.663 --> 01:32:37.791
Thank you, Newt.

1176
01:32:37.874 --> 01:32:39.751
Thank you.

1177
01:32:39.834 --> 01:32:43.713
No matter what you're thinking, Son,
you did the right thing.


1178
01:32:44.923 --> 01:32:48.551
We're sorry about Booker and Marcus, but...

1179

Oh, Jack!

1180

-Marcus.
-Yeah?

He just shot hisself
over at the courthouse.


1187
01:33:18.623 --> 01:33:22.210
Why? Why did he do that?

1188
01:33:23.253 --> 01:33:25.004
Turns out he killed old man Kiner.

1189
01:33:26.131 --> 01:33:27.757
It all happened just now

1190
01:33:28.591 --> 01:33:30.135
at the trial.

1191
01:33:49.279 --> 01:33:51.447
What happened to my old man?

1192
01:33:52.532 --> 01:33:55.451
He shot hisself with my gun.
That's what happened to him.


1193
01:33:55.535 --> 01:33:58.538
He didn't kill old man Kiner,
and I know it.


1194
01:33:58.621 --> 01:34:02.417
Well, Newt Winger says different.
And he saw it all, every damn bit of it.


1195
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.627
I'm gonna kill that bastard.

Newt, your mother's gone.
