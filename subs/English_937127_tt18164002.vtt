00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:10.498
<i>I think what I was
searching for was family.</i>


2
00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:14.737
<i>Like human connection,
that emotional connection,</i>


3
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.608
<i>that family, that community,
it's all the same thing to me.</i>


4
00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:21.242
<i>It's that yelling
into the void</i>


5
00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:24.245
<i>and hoping someone like-minded
likes the same stuff</i>


6
00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.181
<i>that you do to make you feel
like you're not alone</i>


7
00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:27.315
<i>in the world.</i>

8
00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:30.820
<i>So I just wanted
someone to listen to me.</i>


9
00:00:33.623 --> 00:00:35.523
We want Jack!

10
00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:36.592
We want Jack!

11
00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:38.460
We want Jack!

12
00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:40.462
We want Jack!

13
00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:42.330
We want Jack!

14
00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.299
We want Jack!

15
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.738
<i>The kid who grew up here
never thought I could come this far.</i>


16
00:00:49.772 --> 00:00:51.107
<i>I'll never quantify it.</i>

17
00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:53.341
<i>The more I think about it,
the more it's gonna be like,</i>


18
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.210
<i>yeah, why are people here?</i>

19
00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:56.679
<i>I don't know.</i>

20
00:00:58.047 --> 00:00:59.782
<i>I'd like to think they're here
for the same reasons I am.</i>


21
00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:05.487
<i>Top of the morning to you, laddies,</i>

22
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.188
<i>my name is Jacksepticeye
and welcome.</i>


23
00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:09.592
People used to say to me,
and what does he do?


24
00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.727
And I said I don't know
what he's doin'.


25
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.630
I said, "You may just look up
YouTube and find out."


26
00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:16.498
<i>24 million people.</i>

27
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.733
I can't stop smiling.

28
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:19.501
Oh my God,
it's Jacksepticeye!


29
00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:20.568
Jacksepticeye,
ladies and gentleman.


30
00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:22.872
He's a YouTube personality.

31
00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:24.205
Oh, okay.

32
00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:25.173
Thanks for havin' me
on your show.


33
00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:27.743
Well, you've got your
rectangular screen,


34
00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:30.780
there's a game, he's playing it,
and he's commenting.


35
00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:32.648
Oh, this has fuckin'
"Bad News Bears"


36
00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:33.816
written all over it.

37
00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.885
<i>And they go,
"I still don't get it.</i>


38
00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:37.620
<i>He plays video games</i>

39
00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:41.256
and people watch him
in the billions?" Yeah.


40
00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:42.892
Who even needs a tour?

41
00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:44.492
You do.

42
00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:46.896
<i>Live shows and
touring, at it's core,</i>


43
00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.465
<i>is the ultimate combination of
business and story</i>


44
00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:54.603
<i>and themes and drama and
excitement and fandom,</i>


45
00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:56.739
<i>and it's just this train
that's on a track,</i>


46
00:01:56.772 --> 00:01:57.673
<i>and there's no stopping it,</i>

47
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.574
<i>and truly,
the show must go on.</i>


48
00:01:59.608 --> 00:02:00.976
<i>And if something is
not working...</i>


49
00:02:01.342 --> 00:02:02.878
- Check, check.
- ...failure is not an option,


50
00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:04.345
you just have to sort of
figure it out,


51
00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:06.649
<i>and that's terrifying and
exciting at the same time.</i>


52
00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:19.662
<i>We are in
beautiful Copenhagen!</i>


53
00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:21.864
<i>In Denmark.</i>

54
00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:22.898
Spooky shit, huh?

55
00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.566
<i>This is my favorite venue.</i>

56
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.470
<i>Not only is the stage huge to
fit an entire orchestra on it,</i>


57
00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:31.506
<i>but it also has the coolest
general aesthetic,</i>


58
00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:33.709
<i>but it's angled
a different ways.</i>


59
00:02:33.743 --> 00:02:35.878
That's nice to be able to like
pick sight lines


60
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:37.913
and be active and
walk back and forth


61
00:02:37.947 --> 00:02:39.414
across the stage all the time.

62
00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:40.883
So fuckin' cool!

63
00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.518
What are you the most
excited about for the show?


64
00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:44.920
I would say everything.

65
00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:48.057
I learned how to do it once

66
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.390
and you kinda just
get the rhythm.


67
00:02:49.424 --> 00:02:50.726
- Everybody in!
- Everybody in.


68
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.927
Everybody in!

69
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:53.428
You guys are the best,

70
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:55.563
and you guys make
this show much easier


71
00:02:55.598 --> 00:02:56.732
than it ever would be.

72
00:02:57.933 --> 00:02:59.034
And I love you all and I'm very
happy that we're all here


73
00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:01.637
and you're all very hard workers
and I'm proud of you.


74
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.905
We want Jack!

75
00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:04.774
- Let's have a good show!
- We want Jack!


76
00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:06.609
We want Jack!

77
00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:08.343
We want Jack!

78
00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:10.012
We want Jack!

79
00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:13.348
- We want Jack!

90
00:03:55.057 --> 00:03:57.458
<i>Oh!</i>

91
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.561
<i>Um...</i>

92
00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:02.832
<i>Hi. Um...</i>

93
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.768
Why did it cut to me?

94
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:07.535
What happened to
the rest of the video?


95
00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:10.706
What?

96
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.974
<i>What are we gonna do now?</i>

97
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:13.642
<i>Do we... do we have a backup?
Can we...</i>


98
00:04:13.676 --> 00:04:15.010
<i>can we get it rollin' again?</i>

99
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:18.047
<i>Oh, God, um...</i>

100
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.849
Okay, hold on!

101
00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:21.516
Look.

102
00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.518
Shiny keys!

103
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:24.753
<i>Shiny key...</i>

104
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.056
<i>No? Fine.</i>

105
00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:28.090
<i>What about this guy?</i>

106
00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:31.026
<i>He's good, right?</i>

107
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.596
<i>I love him.</i>

108
00:04:33.963 --> 00:04:35.064
<i>No?</i>

109
00:04:35.097 --> 00:04:37.532
<i>Tough crowd.</i>

110
00:04:40.568 --> 00:04:46.108
How to entertain
a live audience.


111
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:49.745
Create the illusion of
direct eye contact?


112
00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:55.150
<i>Is it working?</i>

113
00:04:55.184 --> 00:04:57.485
<i>Okay, I'm gonna start
drawin' a picture,</i>


114
00:04:57.518 --> 00:04:59.487
<i>and you guys have to
guess what it is.</i>


115
00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:05.895
Okay, none of these...

116
00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:07.528
None of these things
are workin',


117
00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:10.032
and we're not gettin'
the video back up.


118
00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:13.135
<i>So let's make a deal, okay?
How about this?</i>


119
00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:15.570
<i>If you come out from
behind your screens,</i>


120
00:05:15.604 --> 00:05:16.906
<i>I'll come out
from behind mine.</i>


121
00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:18.774
<i>Deal?</i>

122
00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:20.175
Okay!

123
00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:21.844
Let's do this thing then!

124
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.206
Top of the mornin' to you,
laddies!


125
00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.511
Oh, you know I had to do
it immediately.


126
00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:58.546
Had to get one in.

127
00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:01.083
Pander to the audience, check,
done already.


128
00:06:01.116 --> 00:06:03.085
Oh, man.

129
00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:05.553
Jesus Christ, this place
is fuckin' nuts!


130
00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:07.589
There's people everywhere!

131
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.795
Welcome, everybody,
to the How Did We Get Here tour.


132
00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:18.100
How's everyone doin'?

133
00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.973
Okay, no, not all at the same
time, Jesus, okay.


134
00:06:24.106 --> 00:06:25.573
How are you doing?

135
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:28.210
Hungry.

136
00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:30.679
Okay, weird answer.
How are you doin'?


137
00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.982
Tired.

138
00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:34.850
Okay, Jesus, all right.

139
00:06:34.883 --> 00:06:38.553
Well, how about I try and perk
you up a little bit, shall I?


140
00:06:40.222 --> 00:06:42.825
So this show,
How Did We Get Here,


141
00:06:42.858 --> 00:06:45.227
it's gonna be a journey
through my life.


142
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.229
It's gonna be a journey
of life itself.


143
00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:51.200
From the start of my life to
whatever the fuck this is.


144
00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:55.570
But it's not just
gonna be my story.


145
00:06:55.604 --> 00:06:57.272
It's not just gonna
be my journey.


146
00:06:57.306 --> 00:06:59.608
It's gonna be all of
our journey,


147
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:01.643
because we're all in
this together.


148
00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:03.178
Kind of like
<i>High School Musical.</i>


149
00:07:08.817 --> 00:07:11.153
<i>The tour itself took on
a life of its own</i>


150
00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:13.022
<i>and became a journey as well.</i>

151
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.159
<i>When we go around America,
each state is different,</i>


152
00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:19.728
<i>and everyone has their own
accent and their own way of life,</i>


153
00:07:19.762 --> 00:07:22.231
<i>but everything still feels
like quintessentially American.</i>


154
00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:27.302
<i>Everybody thinks of America
as being large,</i>


155
00:07:27.336 --> 00:07:31.874
<i>but you get there, you realize
how absolutely massive it is.</i>


156
00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:35.811
<i>You have bigger places,
you have bigger cities,</i>


157
00:07:35.844 --> 00:07:38.747
<i>you have bigger personalities,
you have bigger people.</i>


158
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:41.549
<i>You're just all about being
the best at everything.</i>


159
00:07:42.284 --> 00:07:44.720
<i>As we got out on the road,</i>

160
00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:46.655
<i>we went to visit so many
different places,</i>


161
00:07:46.688 --> 00:07:48.223
<i>and make so many new friends.</i>

162
00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:55.164
<i>We hit East coast and then
Midwest and then West coast.</i>


163
00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:01.603
V-man!

164
00:08:01.637 --> 00:08:03.839
<i>And we got a good bunch of
people on this trip,</i>


165
00:08:04.239 --> 00:08:06.208
<i>which is very, very important
if anyone's gonna tour,</i>


166
00:08:06.241 --> 00:08:08.944
I think, because it's
between the shows


167
00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:10.979
that most of everything
on tour happens.


168
00:08:11.213 --> 00:08:13.048
Oh, no! Oh, no, that's worse
than Hotmail.


169
00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:14.817
<i>If you have a good
bunch of people with you,</i>


170
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.953
<i>they'll energize you like
a good battery.</i>


171
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.089
One of my favorite moments is
actually in New Orleans


172
00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:21.824
when we were all outside
the bus in the evening


173
00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:24.660
'cause we had the day off,
was that our first day off?


174
00:08:25.928 --> 00:08:27.663
<i>And New Orleans is
the most bizarre town</i>


175
00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:28.730
<i>I've ever been in.</i>

176
00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:33.936
<i>You go from like super
old school into the new,</i>


177
00:08:34.403 --> 00:08:37.239
<i>and that was the day when
everyone kind of relaxed</i>


178
00:08:37.272 --> 00:08:38.874
<i>and got to know each
other a bit better.</i>


179
00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:49.251
Oh, good food!

180
00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:55.357
<i>We came back and Vernon
was going around on a city bike</i>


181
00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.059
<i>just circling the bus.</i>

182
00:08:58.293 --> 00:09:01.363
<i>And Justin and JP
and I were all just out</i>


183
00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:03.265
<i>throwing a football around.</i>

184
00:09:05.934 --> 00:09:07.836
<i>And there was just somethin'
about that experience</i>


185
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.739
<i>where I was just kinda sittin'
there goin' yeah, this is fun.</i>


186
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.174
<i>This is cozy and nice,</i>

187
00:09:12.207 --> 00:09:14.009
<i>and everyone's gettin'
along very well.</i>


188
00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:17.012
<i>And when we get back
onto the bus,</i>


189
00:09:17.045 --> 00:09:19.281
<i>everyone just hangs out and
gets to know each other</i>


190
00:09:19.314 --> 00:09:21.150
<i>and talks about each
other's lives.</i>


191
00:09:22.151 --> 00:09:23.719
<i>Yeah, it can be hard
to make friends</i>


192
00:09:23.752 --> 00:09:25.020
<i>when I'm just workin' at
home all the time.</i>


193
00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:27.756
<i>Tour kind of flipped
that on its head.</i>


194
00:09:28.056 --> 00:09:30.159
<i>I got to step out of
my cave for a bit,</i>


195
00:09:30.192 --> 00:09:31.860
<i>and really
get to know everyone.</i>


196
00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:35.664
Oh, where is it?
Put me in, Coach!


197
00:09:36.732 --> 00:09:38.734
Oh!

198
00:09:39.401 --> 00:09:41.303
- Get in there.
- Beanie Babies?


199
00:09:41.737 --> 00:09:43.438
Oh, that's horrifying!

200
00:09:44.806 --> 00:09:47.209
<i>Let's go all the way
back to the very beginning.</i>


201
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.779
Billions and billions
of years ago,


202
00:09:50.812 --> 00:09:52.881
the universe was formed when...

203
00:09:53.215 --> 00:09:55.984
I'm just jokin'.

204
00:09:56.018 --> 00:10:00.322
28 years ago, I burst forth
into the universe!


205
00:10:02.224 --> 00:10:04.893
I was born into
a pretty big family.


206
00:10:04.927 --> 00:10:07.062
So there's seven people
in my family.


207
00:10:07.095 --> 00:10:10.365
I have my two parents,
I have two older brothers,


208
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:12.267
and two older sisters.

209
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:15.170
Which makes me the baby
of the family.


210
00:10:17.773 --> 00:10:20.309
Thanks, guys, I tried real
hard to come last.


211
00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:24.413
This is where I grew up.

212
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.315
This is where I was born into,

213
00:10:26.348 --> 00:10:29.184
and lived for 16 years?

214
00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:31.286
This is so weird, I don't even
know what I'm looking at.


215
00:10:31.453 --> 00:10:33.522
And now,
it's a veterinary clinic.


216
00:10:33.555 --> 00:10:35.090
What is this place?

217
00:10:35.424 --> 00:10:37.492
Um, this used to be
my parent's room,


218
00:10:38.093 --> 00:10:39.328
and then this is my room.

219
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:41.430
Because it was a big family

220
00:10:41.563 --> 00:10:44.199
and everyone was trying to get
a word in all the time,


221
00:10:44.233 --> 00:10:46.535
everyone was always talking
over each other,


222
00:10:46.568 --> 00:10:49.271
talking in my family was like
an Olympic sport.


223
00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:53.275
And I was goin' for Gold.

224
00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:54.343
This wall was never here,

225
00:10:54.376 --> 00:10:56.878
and then our bunk bed
was there goin' that way,


226
00:10:56.912 --> 00:10:59.047
and there was another bed
here goin' this way.


227
00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:01.183
He grew up in a room
where it was just me


228
00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:02.951
and my younger brother, Simon.

229
00:11:02.985 --> 00:11:05.320
We were talking all the time
and talking about life,


230
00:11:05.354 --> 00:11:07.856
and we had this thing where
I would lie on my back


231
00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:09.191
and then kick the mattress up,

232
00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:10.993
and he would fly
through the air.


233
00:11:11.226 --> 00:11:13.128
And the entire wall was
covered in Pearl Jam


234
00:11:13.161 --> 00:11:15.497
and Nirvana posters
and Alice in Chains


235
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.965
and all this weird stuff.

236
00:11:21.236 --> 00:11:23.071
<i>Because I was the youngest
growing up in the family</i>


237
00:11:23.105 --> 00:11:25.941
<i>and seeing so much hardship
go through and my family,</i>


238
00:11:25.974 --> 00:11:27.976
<i>dealing with so many
different things,</i>


239
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.512
I was the knife that cut
the tension every time.


240
00:11:31.146 --> 00:11:33.015
That's why I'm so extroverted

241
00:11:33.048 --> 00:11:34.349
<i>and I'm so jokey all the time,</i>

242
00:11:34.383 --> 00:11:37.252
<i>because whenever tensions
would rise in my household</i>


243
00:11:37.286 --> 00:11:39.454
<i>and people would argue
or you could sense</i>


244
00:11:39.622 --> 00:11:41.456
how much people didn't want
to talk to each other,


245
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.126
I was the one who
was in the middle making jokes


246
00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:45.861
and making people feel at ease

247
00:11:45.894 --> 00:11:47.362
and trying to level
everything out.


248
00:11:47.396 --> 00:11:49.131
Oh, this is bizarre!

249
00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:52.834
It's a good change.

250
00:11:53.068 --> 00:11:55.203
Each day when I would
come from school,


251
00:11:55.237 --> 00:11:57.506
I would run down the field at
the back of my house,


252
00:11:57.539 --> 00:11:59.074
and I would climb this tree.

253
00:12:00.575 --> 00:12:02.144
That big tree is the tree.

254
00:12:02.177 --> 00:12:03.278
The tall one down there.

255
00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:06.014
I loved this tree.

256
00:12:06.048 --> 00:12:07.883
I would have married
this tree if I could.


257
00:12:09.217 --> 00:12:11.086
I checked, it's not legal.

258
00:12:12.087 --> 00:12:15.123
And it is way smaller
than I remember.


259
00:12:15.157 --> 00:12:16.391
The reason I loved
this tree so much


260
00:12:16.425 --> 00:12:18.360
was because I had a rope on it,

261
00:12:18.393 --> 00:12:19.895
and I threw the rope up as high

262
00:12:19.928 --> 00:12:21.396
as I could get it to
go at that age,


263
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.033
and I swung back and forth
all day, every day.


264
00:12:26.568 --> 00:12:28.570
This is so fun!

265
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:31.039
See, to some people,
this is nothin'.


266
00:12:31.907 --> 00:12:34.209
But to me, this is life.

267
00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:38.313
Yeah, I would climb this.

268
00:12:39.047 --> 00:12:40.182
This is happy memories.

269
00:12:41.249 --> 00:12:42.884
<i>This is the good part
of my childhood,</i>


270
00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:46.622
<i>'cause this is pre-internet,
pre-mobile phones and everything.</i>


271
00:12:47.055 --> 00:12:49.458
You had to come outside
and go down into the field


272
00:12:49.491 --> 00:12:51.093
<i>and play to actually have fun.</i>

273
00:12:52.461 --> 00:12:54.329
Jesus, I miss this.

274
00:12:56.365 --> 00:12:59.501
<i>I dunno, it's nice that
I'm actually out here</i>


275
00:12:59.534 --> 00:13:01.970
<i>doing it finally, and I don't
have to sit at home</i>


276
00:13:02.003 --> 00:13:03.472
<i>wondering how things are
gonna go anymore</i>


277
00:13:03.505 --> 00:13:04.640
<i>because we're in
the middle of it,</i>


278
00:13:04.674 --> 00:13:06.375
<i>and it's super fun to do
and I love doing...</i>


279
00:13:06.408 --> 00:13:07.943
We sure are, me.

280
00:13:07.976 --> 00:13:09.444
<i>...having a great time,
time of my life.</i>


281
00:13:13.281 --> 00:13:18.186
<i>There's this sense of
equality and comradery.</i>


282
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.221
What the fuck?

283
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.959
<i>And there's no prima
donnas, there's no diva behavior.</i>


284
00:13:23.992 --> 00:13:25.894
<i>Everybody's agreeable.</i>

285
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.064
<i>I think it's important in life</i>

286
00:13:29.097 --> 00:13:31.266
<i>to like, not take shit
so seriously.</i>


287
00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:32.300
Picture please.

288
00:13:33.201 --> 00:13:34.936
And have fun and be
light and playful,


289
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.440
but also when something
needs to get done,


290
00:13:38.473 --> 00:13:41.711
or there's a specific task that
needs to be accomplished,


291
00:13:41.744 --> 00:13:46.448
then you switch gears
and you just do it


292
00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:47.482
and deal with it.

293
00:13:48.618 --> 00:13:50.051
And you do a good job at it.

294
00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:05.400
You explain to somebody that
you're goin' on tour


295
00:14:05.434 --> 00:14:07.302
with a YouTuber and
they think it's bullshit.


296
00:14:07.335 --> 00:14:08.503
<i>Yeah, it's definitely
different</i>


297
00:14:08.537 --> 00:14:12.140
<i>than a traditional rock
show or music tour.</i>


298
00:14:12.174 --> 00:14:14.509
<i>Anybody that can get up on
stage in front of 3,000 people</i>


299
00:14:14.543 --> 00:14:17.045
<i>and hold their attention for
an hour and a half</i>


300
00:14:17.078 --> 00:14:18.280
<i>and get laughs,</i>

301
00:14:18.313 --> 00:14:20.315
<i>you can't do it unless
you worked really hard.</i>


302
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:23.251
I swear to God, I'm gonna have
to take out this balcony.


303
00:14:28.123 --> 00:14:31.426
I grew up in a very small town
in Ireland called Cloghan.


304
00:14:32.194 --> 00:14:34.129
Yeah, exactly.

305
00:14:34.162 --> 00:14:36.431
No one ever reacts when
I say Cloghan.


306
00:14:37.265 --> 00:14:39.735
I know what you're thinkin',
because it sounds weird, doesn't it?


307
00:14:40.202 --> 00:14:41.671
Cloghan.

308
00:14:41.704 --> 00:14:44.674
Sounds like the sound an old man
makes when he sneezes.


309
00:14:46.609 --> 00:14:50.145
But since you're all gonna be
honorary Irish people


310
00:14:50.178 --> 00:14:51.313
here tonight with me...

311
00:14:56.318 --> 00:14:59.187
You can all try saying it
with me, okay?


312
00:14:59.221 --> 00:15:01.256
- Cloghan.
- Cloghan.


313
00:15:01.289 --> 00:15:04.359
God bless you.

314
00:15:04.727 --> 00:15:07.062
In the town of Cloghan,
it was so small,


315
00:15:07.095 --> 00:15:10.232
there was only 600 people
in the entire town.


316
00:15:10.265 --> 00:15:11.634
Really, really small place,

317
00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:13.535
so everybody kind of
knew everybody.


318
00:15:13.736 --> 00:15:16.338
You saw the same faces
over and over again


319
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.340
when you were going around town.

320
00:15:18.373 --> 00:15:22.344
So each weekend in our house,

321
00:15:22.377 --> 00:15:23.478
would show up.

322
00:15:25.146 --> 00:15:26.716
All sittin' around
the kitchen table,


323
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:29.150
and me being 10 years old
in the middle like.


324
00:15:32.554 --> 00:15:33.555
This is great!

325
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.558
Everyone here is best friends.

326
00:15:37.492 --> 00:15:39.060
They weren't,
they were just really drunk.


327
00:15:40.128 --> 00:15:42.063
We had a table but we didn't
have chairs at it,


328
00:15:42.097 --> 00:15:43.766
we had like a bench either side.

329
00:15:44.266 --> 00:15:46.434
So people would just show up and
there'd be like four people here,


330
00:15:46.468 --> 00:15:48.704
four people there, and a whole
bunch of others all around it.


331
00:15:48.738 --> 00:15:50.238
Some people in the sittin' room.

332
00:15:50.272 --> 00:15:53.441
But when this would happen,
because I was so small,


333
00:15:53.475 --> 00:15:56.077
all the drunk people would try
and get a rise out of me.


334
00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:58.113
They would try and make fun
of me all the time.


335
00:15:58.146 --> 00:15:59.447
So they'd come up to me,
shit faced,


336
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:03.619
like, "How are you, Seany?

337
00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:07.389
You're fuckin' small,
aren't ya?"


338
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:11.493
And I'd just stand there goin',
"Bitch!"


339
00:16:14.362 --> 00:16:17.700
I was fast. I knew how to turn
it around on them immediately,


340
00:16:17.733 --> 00:16:20.135
and I think being that age
was the first time


341
00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:23.238
I ever remember making a room
full of people laugh.


342
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:25.540
I wanted more.

343
00:16:25.675 --> 00:16:28.376
During New Years, after...
sometimes after we would do the thing


344
00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.245
on the roundabout, a bunch of
people would just come back


345
00:16:30.278 --> 00:16:32.247
here for like a house party
and continue drinkin'


346
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.548
'cause the pubs'd close.

347
00:16:34.884 --> 00:16:36.384
<i>I never had the drive to like
as soon as I turned 18,</i>


348
00:16:36.418 --> 00:16:37.452
<i>go out and get hammered.</i>

349
00:16:38.553 --> 00:16:40.555
I have, but it wasn't a thing
of I need to go out


350
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.824
every weekend like they did,

351
00:16:41.857 --> 00:16:44.627
because I knew how
dangerous it could be.


352
00:16:44.827 --> 00:16:45.861
I knew how scary it could be.

353
00:16:46.996 --> 00:16:48.764
I knew how much misery it could
bring into a household,


354
00:16:48.798 --> 00:16:52.467
and how much emotion
it could drive.


355
00:16:52.868 --> 00:16:56.271
<i>My dad had been, like,
swore off drink and cigarettes</i>


356
00:16:56.304 --> 00:16:58.708
<i>from when I was very,
very young.</i>


357
00:16:58.741 --> 00:17:00.910
<i>It wasn't until I was much
older that I understood why,</i>


358
00:17:00.943 --> 00:17:03.111
<i>that he was
an alcoholic as well.</i>


359
00:17:03.511 --> 00:17:07.817
<i>But I never saw my dad like
that, I came much later.</i>


360
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.584
<i>With Malcolm and Simon,
I think they've both</i>


361
00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.888
<i>gone through severe
alcoholism and thankfully,</i>


362
00:17:12.922 --> 00:17:14.757
<i>both gotten out of it now.</i>

363
00:17:15.223 --> 00:17:18.226
<i>It's just like blinking
through life,</i>


364
00:17:18.393 --> 00:17:20.328
<i>and their life is just
flying past them</i>


365
00:17:20.362 --> 00:17:21.897
<i>because they're never
sober through it,</i>


366
00:17:22.364 --> 00:17:24.466
<i>and both of them have dealt
with suicidal thoughts,</i>


367
00:17:24.499 --> 00:17:26.636
<i>and Malcolm tried to go
through with it.</i>


368
00:17:46.889 --> 00:17:48.858
I would have felt
my life growing up


369
00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:51.359
was kind of tough now,

370
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:54.697
um, and that's left it's own
scars on me too,


371
00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:55.898
but maybe he learned from us,

372
00:17:55.931 --> 00:17:57.767
and maybe he learned what to do

373
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.769
and maybe what not to do,
you know?


374
00:17:59.802 --> 00:18:01.671
Maybe it's not all negative,
you know?


375
00:18:06.574 --> 00:18:08.176
This is the church.

376
00:18:08.209 --> 00:18:11.379
<i>Every Saturday,
half the town would show up for church</i>


377
00:18:11.413 --> 00:18:12.514
<i>including my family.</i>

378
00:18:13.683 --> 00:18:14.917
Every Sunday morning, the rest
of the town would show up


379
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:15.951
and go to church.

380
00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:18.286
I'm actually curious
if we can go into it.


381
00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:21.423
<i>So everybody in the town saw
God at least once that week.</i>


382
00:18:26.595 --> 00:18:28.329
<i>Being a 10 year old in church,</i>

383
00:18:28.731 --> 00:18:30.465
<i>you kind of get a bit bored.</i>

384
00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:32.367
This is so bizarre.

385
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.771
<i>So I decided, I'm gonna
spice things up a bit.</i>


386
00:18:35.805 --> 00:18:38.941
I'm gonna become an altar boy.

387
00:18:41.844 --> 00:18:43.679
Oh no, not that type of story!

388
00:18:45.681 --> 00:18:46.749
Jesus.

389
00:18:46.782 --> 00:18:49.785
You have to pay a lot more
money to see that show.


390
00:18:52.454 --> 00:18:54.456
Those are the exact same bells
that I would ring


391
00:18:54.489 --> 00:18:55.490
when I was 10.

392
00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:57.727
<i>I'll paint you a little
picture of what it was like.</i>


393
00:18:58.627 --> 00:18:59.895
Weird.

394
00:18:59.929 --> 00:19:03.364
This is the priest,
a very short priest.


395
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.435
We would be kneeling down
as altar boys,


396
00:19:07.469 --> 00:19:09.337
me and one of my best friends.

397
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.742
Me here, best friend,
and then two guys over there.


398
00:19:12.775 --> 00:19:15.745
<i>Two pairs of altar boys
are at each side of the altar,</i>


399
00:19:15.778 --> 00:19:17.445
but what that means is that
while the priest


400
00:19:17.613 --> 00:19:19.982
is on the altar talking,
you're facing each other,


401
00:19:20.015 --> 00:19:21.617
and if you look up,
you're looking straight at


402
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.685
the other person unobstructed.

403
00:19:22.718 --> 00:19:24.987
So if they're already
struggling to hide a laugh


404
00:19:25.353 --> 00:19:27.022
and you see that in the middle
of what's supposed to be


405
00:19:27.056 --> 00:19:28.991
a very serious context,
it's the most difficult thing


406
00:19:29.024 --> 00:19:30.860
in the world to try and
not laugh yourself.


407
00:19:31.026 --> 00:19:32.762
You could just see like,
the shoulders goin' up and down,


408
00:19:32.795 --> 00:19:33.929
laughin' their asses off.

409
00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:36.732
During communion, the collection
plates would go around.


410
00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:39.735
You know, collect money,
keep the church running,


411
00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:42.037
keep the lights on,
keep God happy.


412
00:19:45.674 --> 00:19:48.510
And I've seen this done
a million times.


413
00:19:48.543 --> 00:19:50.378
I knew exactly what
had to happen,


414
00:19:50.411 --> 00:19:52.380
I knew where
the collection plates were.


415
00:19:52.413 --> 00:19:55.951
They were always over in this
area on the baptismal font.


416
00:19:56.619 --> 00:19:58.587
Kind of where these people are,
hi.


417
00:19:59.889 --> 00:20:01.857
A baptismal
font doesn't fuckin' wave!


418
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.029
The priest looked at me,
it was my time


419
00:20:07.062 --> 00:20:08.496
to go get the collection plates.

420
00:20:09.632 --> 00:20:11.533
He looked at me and said,
"You got this, my child."


421
00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:15.070
Got you, fam.

422
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.639
And then comin' over

423
00:20:16.672 --> 00:20:18.040
and realizing that there
was nothing there.


424
00:20:18.506 --> 00:20:20.609
Oh shit!

425
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:21.811
They're not there!

426
00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:24.013
Where did they go?

427
00:20:24.046 --> 00:20:25.915
But every seat was full,

428
00:20:26.682 --> 00:20:28.550
and everybody was lookin' at
me and laughin'.


429
00:20:29.084 --> 00:20:32.688
All of a sudden,
my sister's husband's father,


430
00:20:33.088 --> 00:20:35.758
that's right,
came all the way up to the front


431
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:37.593
with the collection
plate in his hand.


432
00:20:37.626 --> 00:20:39.895
Now, I have no idea
where he got these.


433
00:20:41.496 --> 00:20:42.731
He must've pulled them
out of his arse.


434
00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:45.768
And do you know what
his name was?


435
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:47.535
Jimmy Christy.

436
00:20:48.137 --> 00:20:49.537
J Christy.

437
00:20:50.072 --> 00:20:52.373
Jesus Christ himself came
down to help me!


438
00:21:04.086 --> 00:21:06.421
<i>Bus life is good.
I love bus life.</i>


439
00:21:06.454 --> 00:21:07.790
<i>I love hangin' out with
people on the bus,</i>


440
00:21:07.823 --> 00:21:08.958
<i>and I love being on tour.</i>

441
00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:11.293
You look like one of the guys
from West Coast Customs.


442
00:21:11.327 --> 00:21:13.028
This is
Justin, he's on carburetors.


443
00:21:13.494 --> 00:21:14.864
This is Arin, he's on paint.

444
00:21:18.334 --> 00:21:19.702
<i>Because you share such
a small space with everybody,</i>


445
00:21:20.903 --> 00:21:22.905
<i>you end up forming these
really great bonds,</i>


446
00:21:22.938 --> 00:21:24.940
<i>and you're kind of forced to
hang out with each other</i>


447
00:21:24.974 --> 00:21:26.675
<i>and talk to each other,
which I love.</i>


448
00:21:26.809 --> 00:21:28.077
<i>Everyone's a small
little family.</i>


449
00:21:28.844 --> 00:21:30.880
This is so cool!

450
00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:33.448
<i>I don't know much about
American history,</i>


451
00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:34.984
<i>but I think it's awesome,</i>

452
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.186
'cause this is stuff that
we only see in movies.


453
00:21:37.219 --> 00:21:38.921
<i>It's one of the first times
that I've seen buildings</i>


454
00:21:38.954 --> 00:21:41.056
<i>in person where they
not only look nicer,</i>


455
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.992
<i>but they also look bigger
than I thought they were.</i>


456
00:21:54.603 --> 00:21:59.675
But this is gigantic
and it's awesome!


457
00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:03.012
Wow, it's lookin' real good
out here, guys. Real good.


458
00:22:03.045 --> 00:22:05.014
Primo Jacksepticeye signature.

459
00:22:05.047 --> 00:22:07.983
That should be worth...
that should be worth nothing.


460
00:22:08.017 --> 00:22:10.853
People were getting like Darth Maul
tattoos before the movie came out


461
00:22:10.886 --> 00:22:12.721
because they're like
this is the new Vader!


462
00:22:12.755 --> 00:22:14.455
And then they killed him
in the first episode.


463
00:22:14.489 --> 00:22:15.891
Darth Maul's still badass, man.

464
00:22:15.925 --> 00:22:19.061
"Killing younglings." The line
that Ewan McGregor couldn't deliver


465
00:22:19.094 --> 00:22:20.863
without laughing so he had
to cover his mouth.


466
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.066
- Really?
- "Killing younglings!" Like he...


467
00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:25.466
It's so funny.

468
00:22:25.634 --> 00:22:26.902
There's a nice shot right here.

469
00:22:27.202 --> 00:22:28.203
Good one.

470
00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:33.474
<i>I just remember there
being a weird sense</i>


471
00:22:34.743 --> 00:22:35.344
<i>of when you start to walk in
you're like this looks</i>


472
00:22:35.377 --> 00:22:36.679
<i>so fuckin' familiar.</i>

473
00:22:36.712 --> 00:22:38.147
<i>Oh yeah,
that happened to me</i>.


474
00:22:39.081 --> 00:22:40.082
<i>What the hell?</i>

475
00:22:40.115 --> 00:22:42.184
This is touring.
If you don't do this stuff...


476
00:22:42.217 --> 00:22:43.319
Well, yeah. You're like...

477
00:22:43.352 --> 00:22:45.187
<i>When am I ever gonna be
in Dallas again?</i>


478
00:22:50.059 --> 00:22:52.027
<i>Can I have one American
cheeseburger?</i>


479
00:22:52.261 --> 00:22:55.631
Can I get a seven layer
burrito with chicken, I guess?


480
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.669
- Thank you, bud.
- We ordered a half a town's worth of food.


481
00:23:00.836 --> 00:23:03.072
You look like
Jacksepticeye from YouTube.


482
00:23:03.105 --> 00:23:04.974
Nah, I hate that guy.

483
00:23:06.141 --> 00:23:07.843
<i>Last night,
we were in Philly.</i>


484
00:23:07.876 --> 00:23:09.745
The biggest show of
the entire tour.


485
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:13.816
<i>Well, this leg of
the tour anyway.</i>


486
00:23:13.849 --> 00:23:14.917
Oh, hi!

487
00:23:15.718 --> 00:23:17.252
<i>Some of the jokes that
I told during that one</i>


488
00:23:17.286 --> 00:23:20.089
<i>have killed in Philly more
than they ever have</i>


489
00:23:20.122 --> 00:23:22.557
<i>in any of the other venues
which is so bizarre,</i>


490
00:23:22.591 --> 00:23:24.559
<i>but fascinating to me at
the same time.</i>


491
00:23:24.994 --> 00:23:28.797
<i>The Durham show, that was
a huge crowd as well.</i>


492
00:23:28.831 --> 00:23:30.199
<i>There was just like
three mezzanines</i>


493
00:23:30.232 --> 00:23:31.934
<i>and all the way up to the top.</i>

494
00:23:35.104 --> 00:23:36.372
<i>This group of fans on
Tumblr and Twitter</i>


495
00:23:36.405 --> 00:23:38.941
<i>started handing out green
slips of paper at shows</i>


496
00:23:39.108 --> 00:23:40.242
<i>for people's phones.</i>

497
00:23:41.542 --> 00:23:42.778
<i>It made the audience look like
a sea of green stars.</i>


498
00:23:42.811 --> 00:23:45.580
<i>That blew me away every time
I walked out on stage.</i>


499
00:23:46.949 --> 00:23:50.819
Look at all the beautiful little green
lights out here tonight, I love it!


500
00:23:52.588 --> 00:23:56.091
<i>And now we're in DC,
which has one of the smallest shows</i>


501
00:23:56.125 --> 00:23:57.292
<i>of the entire tour.</i>

502
00:23:58.894 --> 00:24:00.829
<i>Cloghan also had a dark side.</i>

503
00:24:02.765 --> 00:24:04.299
A seedy underbelly.

504
00:24:05.701 --> 00:24:09.038
Each year in Cloghan,
the biggest night of the year,


505
00:24:09.071 --> 00:24:11.774
every year, was New Year's Eve.

506
00:24:12.274 --> 00:24:14.810
But in Cloghan,
we had a bit of a ritual.


507
00:24:15.077 --> 00:24:16.245
Do you know what
a roundabout is?


508
00:24:16.612 --> 00:24:17.980
Yeah!

509
00:24:18.013 --> 00:24:20.849
Okay, some of you are
with me for now.


510
00:24:22.217 --> 00:24:25.888
The roundabout in Cloghan
was called "The Square."


511
00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.028
I don't know why.

512
00:24:33.929 --> 00:24:35.731
You'll understand as
the night goes on,


513
00:24:35.898 --> 00:24:37.199
Irish people make no sense.

514
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:42.304
On this "Square,"
there were five roads,


515
00:24:42.838 --> 00:24:44.773
and that was the joke
about Cloghan.


516
00:24:44.807 --> 00:24:47.109
The best thing about Cloghan
were the five roads


517
00:24:47.142 --> 00:24:49.111
that took you away from Cloghan.

518
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.915
We would take two pitchforks.

519
00:24:56.952 --> 00:24:59.321
Two lads would stand on
this roundabout


520
00:24:59.354 --> 00:25:00.923
with sods of turf.

521
00:25:00.956 --> 00:25:02.257
Do you know what turf is?

522
00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:04.059
Yeah!

523
00:25:04.093 --> 00:25:05.094
Really?

524
00:25:07.229 --> 00:25:09.364
Turf is what you dig
out of a bog


525
00:25:09.398 --> 00:25:11.133
to burn in your fire for winter.

526
00:25:12.868 --> 00:25:13.969
Oh!

527
00:25:15.804 --> 00:25:17.206
You didn't fuckin' know, did ya?

528
00:25:19.374 --> 00:25:21.343
We would take these sods of turf

529
00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:23.011
and put them on the pitchforks.

530
00:25:25.714 --> 00:25:27.082
And then light them on fire.

531
00:25:29.718 --> 00:25:31.920
Two lads with
flaming pitchforks.


532
00:25:33.155 --> 00:25:35.257
<i>One guy next to him
playing a fiddle.</i>


533
00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:39.261
<i>Jesus Christ was back
playing the accordion,</i>


534
00:25:40.729 --> 00:25:43.832
<i>and the entire town of Cloghan
would line up behind them,</i>


535
00:25:43.866 --> 00:25:46.869
<i>walking down each of these
five streets singing songs.</i>


536
00:25:47.736 --> 00:25:50.139
<i>Now, I used to think
this was normal.</i>


537
00:25:52.741 --> 00:25:55.244
<i>Until we started writing
material for this show</i>


538
00:25:55.277 --> 00:25:57.312
<i>and I thought, hold on.</i>

539
00:25:59.014 --> 00:26:01.416
How batshit crazy must
that have looked?


540
00:26:03.785 --> 00:26:05.787
If you were driving through
Cloghan that night


541
00:26:06.788 --> 00:26:09.958
<i>and you saw 600 people all
standing around a roundabout</i>


542
00:26:09.992 --> 00:26:11.293
<i>they called "The Square,"</i>

543
00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:14.129
with flaming pitchforks
in their hands,


544
00:26:14.163 --> 00:26:15.964
hands held together,
singing kumbaya


545
00:26:15.998 --> 00:26:17.699
like they're about to summon
the fuckin' antichrist


546
00:26:17.733 --> 00:26:21.069
out of the ground.

547
00:26:23.739 --> 00:26:25.807
There's no fuckin'
roundabout anymore!


548
00:26:26.008 --> 00:26:27.976
<i>We keep talkin' in the show
about this roundabout</i>


549
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.013
<i>in the joke about Cloghan
and the ritual we used to do,</i>


550
00:26:31.046 --> 00:26:33.081
and the roundabout used to
be right there.


551
00:26:34.016 --> 00:26:36.418
Right in the middle of town
for the five roads.


552
00:26:37.219 --> 00:26:39.154
Is it weird that
everything's smaller?


553
00:26:39.755 --> 00:26:41.423
We would all stand around here,

554
00:26:41.757 --> 00:26:43.058
all around the roundabout.

555
00:26:43.091 --> 00:26:44.760
Like completely encircled.

556
00:26:45.928 --> 00:26:47.696
Oh, Cloghan, never change.

557
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.131
Actually wait, do.

558
00:26:49.164 --> 00:26:50.199
That's fuckin' weird.

559
00:26:54.002 --> 00:26:55.771
<i>My brain overthinks.</i>

560
00:26:55.804 --> 00:26:57.940
<i>So being in some areas where
I can turn my brain off</i>


561
00:26:57.973 --> 00:26:59.374
<i>is very, very important to me.</i>

562
00:27:00.742 --> 00:27:03.912
<i>Like me doing YouTube videos
is when my brain turns off</i>


563
00:27:03.946 --> 00:27:06.715
<i>and I just get to be like
completely free-form.</i>


564
00:27:07.049 --> 00:27:09.051
<i>I get to do what I want.
I'm not overthinking myself.</i>


565
00:27:09.084 --> 00:27:10.285
<i>I just do.</i>

566
00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:13.055
<i>There's times when
I'm in kind of a shitty mood,</i>


567
00:27:13.088 --> 00:27:14.056
and I'll start
recording the games


568
00:27:15.224 --> 00:27:16.792
and I'm like, "Oh, do I have to
record somethin' today?"


569
00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:18.827
And then like five
minutes into it,


570
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.198
I'm completely turned around because
it's just, that's my happy place.


571
00:27:23.232 --> 00:27:25.367
That's where I feel like
I operate best.


572
00:27:28.103 --> 00:27:29.538
<i>What your brain wants is
something different</i>


573
00:27:29.571 --> 00:27:31.373
<i>than what your heart
wants to do.</i>


574
00:27:33.075 --> 00:27:36.078
<i>Your brain wants to just
stay in work mode</i>


575
00:27:36.111 --> 00:27:37.913
<i>and do what it needs to do,</i>

576
00:27:37.946 --> 00:27:40.249
<i>but your heart always
wants to explore,</i>


577
00:27:40.282 --> 00:27:42.484
<i>and your heart wants to enjoy
whatever you're doing.</i>


578
00:27:42.517 --> 00:27:44.519
<i>Your heart is where
the art is, I think,</i>


579
00:27:45.287 --> 00:27:46.989
<i>and then your body wants
something else</i>


580
00:27:47.022 --> 00:27:48.357
<i>completely separate
from those.</i>


581
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.826
<i>So it's all about finding
the balance between all three.</i>


582
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.894
Instagram livestream.

583
00:27:54.162 --> 00:27:56.164
<i>There's not one thing that
everyone wants to do.</i>


584
00:27:59.001 --> 00:28:01.903
<i>You change like every three
to five years anyway.</i>


585
00:28:01.937 --> 00:28:04.006
<i>So maybe you're trying to
find several versions</i>


586
00:28:04.039 --> 00:28:05.040
<i>of yourself.</i>

587
00:28:12.447 --> 00:28:15.317
There's so many, so many people.
So many fans.


588
00:28:16.151 --> 00:28:17.886
<i>They socialize, they talk about the show,</i>

589
00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:19.521
<i>they talk about material
that's online,</i>


590
00:28:19.888 --> 00:28:21.857
<i>and they develop
friendships that last</i>


591
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.392
<i>longer than just that show.</i>

592
00:28:29.898 --> 00:28:31.066
Selling merch.

593
00:28:31.566 --> 00:28:32.868
The most important job.

594
00:28:33.468 --> 00:28:34.469
Everyone knows that.

595
00:28:35.605 --> 00:28:38.440
There's only one shirt,
a tour t-shirt, poster, beanie.


596
00:28:41.943 --> 00:28:43.445
It's a very dangerous job.

597
00:28:44.046 --> 00:28:45.213
I'm gonna get some
fans to help me.


598
00:28:48.183 --> 00:28:50.085
You're big, you can probably
lift this whole thing up, right?


599
00:28:55.957 --> 00:28:58.226
<i>It's absolutely insane.</i>

600
00:28:58.927 --> 00:29:01.263
<i>Every single person
buys merch.</i>


601
00:29:01.597 --> 00:29:04.199
<i>No one has ever complained
about waiting in line.</i>


602
00:29:04.232 --> 00:29:06.301
<i>Well, there's always
the tired fathers,</i>


603
00:29:06.335 --> 00:29:08.070
but I mean, I just give 'em
one of those.


604
00:29:08.103 --> 00:29:09.371
Like, "You're a good man."

605
00:29:10.572 --> 00:29:11.440
<i>Before the show they're
excited for the show.</i>


606
00:29:11.473 --> 00:29:14.076
I have never seen
anybody live before!


607
00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:16.511
His excitement just makes me
extremely happy.


608
00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:18.447
After the show,
they're high from the show.


609
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.083
He uplifted us and encouraged us
to follow our dreams.


610
00:29:21.116 --> 00:29:23.919
I like how he ended the show
with his message,


611
00:29:23.952 --> 00:29:24.986
<i>keep pushing forward.</i>

612
00:29:33.261 --> 00:29:35.063
<i>In my secondary school days,</i>

613
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.966
that's when the name
Jacksepticeye was born.


614
00:29:41.203 --> 00:29:43.071
Welcome to my school!

615
00:29:43.673 --> 00:29:45.207
Or at least, what was my school.

616
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.341
It's not a school anymore.

617
00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:49.344
Because in school, I had
a friend. A friend named Paul.


618
00:29:49.544 --> 00:29:52.047
I may or may not have
kissed a girl


619
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.582
at the back of this classroom.

620
00:29:53.949 --> 00:29:56.518
And he found out that my
mother called me Jack,


621
00:29:57.219 --> 00:30:00.188
because I don't know,
Jack and Sean go together?


622
00:30:02.557 --> 00:30:04.292
Because Sean is Irish for John

623
00:30:04.326 --> 00:30:06.128
and John and Jack go together?

624
00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:09.599
Yeah, I told ya Irish people
make no sense.


625
00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:13.803
<i>One day, we were out on the
playground playing football.</i>


626
00:30:13.836 --> 00:30:17.272
None of this stuff was here,
this was all completely open.


627
00:30:17.305 --> 00:30:19.207
There was a set of goals
down that side,


628
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:20.643
there was a set of
goals this side.


629
00:30:20.676 --> 00:30:24.312
Great day,
sun beaming in the sky.


630
00:30:24.747 --> 00:30:27.482
It wasn't.

631
00:30:27.516 --> 00:30:28.618
Everybody in the school

632
00:30:28.651 --> 00:30:30.185
came out
to watch us play football.


633
00:30:30.218 --> 00:30:31.553
Even the teachers.

634
00:30:31.586 --> 00:30:33.656
They didn't.

635
00:30:34.055 --> 00:30:37.159
The fuck?

636
00:30:37.426 --> 00:30:40.929
The ball went up into the air
and I saw goals in my eyes.


637
00:30:41.096 --> 00:30:42.330
I wanted to impress everybody.

638
00:30:42.497 --> 00:30:47.202
So I launched myself
into the air after the ball.


639
00:30:47.235 --> 00:30:49.971
Fun fact, this is when the Irish
space program was born.


640
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.074
And I went up to like hit it
and hit it down


641
00:30:53.108 --> 00:30:55.377
towards these goals
to like, score.


642
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.980
As I went up into the air,
my 14-year-old muscles


643
00:30:59.014 --> 00:31:04.052
bristling under my shirt,
testosterone fueling my body,


644
00:31:04.553 --> 00:31:06.555
my long blonde hair
flowing in the wind.


645
00:31:07.723 --> 00:31:09.558
When I went up to header it,

646
00:31:09.592 --> 00:31:11.426
some other dude
was comin' up this way.


647
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.296
I should mention, this person
was wearing a pair of glasses.


648
00:31:16.298 --> 00:31:20.402
And I'm not a scientist,
but I'm pretty sure that mass


649
00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:23.271
times acceleration plus really
sharp pair of glasses


650
00:31:23.305 --> 00:31:25.273
to my eye
equals really fuckin' bad.


651
00:31:27.576 --> 00:31:29.444
And when I went like that and
he also like, came towards me,


652
00:31:29.478 --> 00:31:31.546
so I like, I was...

653
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.483
I was the fuckin' motion that
actually hit my own head.


654
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.686
And when I hit him, I saw stars

655
00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:38.588
and my vision went
black for a second.


656
00:31:38.621 --> 00:31:42.023
Red went everywhere like
a human jam donut.


657
00:31:43.024 --> 00:31:45.527
Coming down my face,
streaking half my vision


658
00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.996
like a pair of old,
shitty 3D glasses.


659
00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.298
Then I was brought down
into the main building


660
00:31:50.332 --> 00:31:52.668
to get fixed, but when I was
walking down past everyone,


661
00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:54.436
they were all like, "Oh, fuck!"

662
00:31:54.469 --> 00:31:56.171
'Cause there was blood
all over my face.


663
00:31:56.204 --> 00:31:58.573
Some people on
the sidelines gasped.


664
00:32:00.743 --> 00:32:02.444
Some people cried.

665
00:32:04.513 --> 00:32:07.215
The older kids said,
"Who the fuck is that again?"


666
00:32:09.117 --> 00:32:11.520
The teacher bandaged me up
and I was sent home


667
00:32:11.553 --> 00:32:13.689
because I was too scary to look
at for the rest of the kids.


668
00:32:15.423 --> 00:32:17.593
And after about two weeks
had passed,


669
00:32:17.627 --> 00:32:21.530
I came back to school but my
wound hadn't healed up fully.


670
00:32:21.831 --> 00:32:24.800
I came back and I had this big,
gross, green lump


671
00:32:24.834 --> 00:32:26.636
over my eye.

672
00:32:26.802 --> 00:32:29.204
My friend, Paul,
said he would take liberty


673
00:32:29.237 --> 00:32:33.074
and extend the Jack name further
into Jacksepticeye.


674
00:32:39.481 --> 00:32:41.249
Oh, he thought that was great.

675
00:32:41.283 --> 00:32:43.084
He thought it'd be fun
to get everybody


676
00:32:43.118 --> 00:32:44.519
to call me Jacksepticeye.

677
00:32:44.553 --> 00:32:46.822
He even tried to get my
teachers to call me it.


678
00:32:48.156 --> 00:32:49.491
Who's laughing now, Paul?

679
00:32:56.398 --> 00:32:57.700
God, 12 years ago.

680
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.201
Jesus.

681
00:33:02.437 --> 00:33:03.806
<i>The show we did
last night in LA,</i>


682
00:33:03.839 --> 00:33:07.275
<i>was the first show back after
two months of doing the tour.</i>


683
00:33:07.309 --> 00:33:08.410
<i>First show of leg three.</i>

684
00:33:08.443 --> 00:33:09.812
I'm excited to see you.

685
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.882
<i>I know like,

686
00:33:12.915 --> 00:33:14.382
I'll find you in the crowd.

687
00:33:14.717 --> 00:33:15.785
Lock eyes with me!

688
00:33:16.786 --> 00:33:18.086
Let's bounce.

689
00:33:19.454 --> 00:33:22.123
<i>I do the show better now since
the first leg of the tour,</i>


690
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.291
I think.

691
00:33:24.225 --> 00:33:25.628
- Break a leg.
- I'll break both.


692
00:33:25.661 --> 00:33:26.762
You got this.

693
00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:28.296
Supposed to get your
adrenaline goin'


694
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.498
or your testosterone or
some bullshit.


695
00:33:31.166 --> 00:33:33.636
This is the most friends that
have been at a show so far.


696
00:33:35.236 --> 00:33:38.540
<i>This one, it's more just like
anxiety, but it's a good one.</i>


697
00:33:38.573 --> 00:33:41.109
<i>Like butterflies where
I'm so excited to do it.</i>


698
00:33:41.576 --> 00:33:43.311
Top of the mornin' to ya!

699
00:33:45.615 --> 00:33:47.282
<i>It's nice to know
the material well enough</i>


700
00:33:47.315 --> 00:33:50.352
<i>that now, if I meander off
into an improv part,</i>


701
00:33:50.385 --> 00:33:51.621
<i>when I come back,
I'm not lost.</i>


702
00:33:52.287 --> 00:33:53.589
How you doin'?

703
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:55.290
I didn't fuckin' ask you!

704
00:33:57.525 --> 00:33:58.694
This is our moment.

705
00:34:00.362 --> 00:34:01.897
<i>The audience is there just to
have a good time,</i>


706
00:34:01.931 --> 00:34:03.899
<i>you just have to lead 'em in
the right direction.</i>


707
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.603
<i>I'm... I'm really happy
with how things have gone.</i>


708
00:34:07.637 --> 00:34:09.639
<i>I'm really proud of how
he's handling it,</i>


709
00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:12.608
<i>and how the community as
a whole support each other.</i>


710
00:34:12.642 --> 00:34:14.275
<i>Please welcome
to the stage, Jacksepticeye!</i>


711
00:34:16.779 --> 00:34:19.615
<i>Even in the relatively
small Q&A sections</i>


712
00:34:19.649 --> 00:34:21.516
<i>here on the tour
before the shows,</i>


713
00:34:21.549 --> 00:34:23.585
<i>some people when they get up
to ask the questions</i>


714
00:34:23.619 --> 00:34:25.353
<i>and they're really nervous
and they might</i>


715
00:34:25.387 --> 00:34:27.623
<i>not get the words out
that they want to say,</i>


716
00:34:28.256 --> 00:34:31.359
not only does Sean encourage
them and say take their time,


717
00:34:31.393 --> 00:34:33.328
take a deep breath,
but you can hear other people


718
00:34:33.361 --> 00:34:36.197
in the crowd just sort of
shout, "It's okay,


719
00:34:36.364 --> 00:34:38.366
<i>you can do it,
take your time!"</i>


720
00:34:39.334 --> 00:34:41.771
Of all the other panels and
shows I've been to,


721
00:34:41.804 --> 00:34:43.338
it's very rare.

722
00:34:46.642 --> 00:34:47.843
<i>It's not just
this magical thing</i>


723
00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:49.879
<i>that suddenly you're an adult
and you know exactly</i>


724
00:34:49.912 --> 00:34:51.513
<i>what's going on and what
you're doing. It's like...</i>


725
00:34:51.546 --> 00:34:52.915
<i>you have to get through
those rough years</i>


726
00:34:52.948 --> 00:34:54.717
as a teenager to figure
out who you are


727
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:56.518
and what you want to do and
where you're goin'.


728
00:34:57.585 --> 00:35:00.188
<i>We're all still tryin' to
figure it out even as adults.</i>


729
00:35:02.658 --> 00:35:04.559
Oh, I don't like this at all.

730
00:35:04.593 --> 00:35:05.695
Hi, Jimmy!

731
00:35:05.728 --> 00:35:07.228
All the way up here.

732
00:35:07.262 --> 00:35:08.898
- Wow!
- This is terrifying.


733
00:35:09.431 --> 00:35:12.601
<i>Life's obstacles suck,
but you can overcome them.</i>


734
00:35:12.802 --> 00:35:13.803
I don't like it.

735
00:35:15.137 --> 00:35:15.738
<i>You can still work hard
and you can have fun with it,</i>


736
00:35:16.906 --> 00:35:18.306
<i>and you can chase a dream
if you have it.</i>


737
00:35:18.339 --> 00:35:19.675
<i>Doesn't have to be YouTube,</i>

738
00:35:19.709 --> 00:35:21.744
<i>but as long as
you're passionate about it</i>


739
00:35:21.777 --> 00:35:23.278
<i>and you're trying to
work towards</i>


740
00:35:23.311 --> 00:35:24.814
<i>the best version of yourself,</i>

741
00:35:24.847 --> 00:35:26.247
<i>then that's what's important.</i>

742
00:35:26.281 --> 00:35:27.983
She just said it's
the throne of God!


743
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:33.889
Oh, that's how you kill culture.

744
00:35:37.525 --> 00:35:39.394
'Cause everyone thinks touring is gonna
be like, sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, baby.


745
00:35:40.663 --> 00:35:43.733
Not that any of us ever do that,
but it's that kind of boisterous


746
00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:45.400
<i>kind of environment
that people think</i>


747
00:35:45.433 --> 00:35:46.769
<i>is gonna be hectic or crazy.</i>

748
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.705
Did you find someone?
Oh, yes!


749
00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:51.974
<i>There's a lot of hurry up
and wait energy on tour,</i>


750
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.409
<i>'cause you get in in the mornings
and everything's like go, go, go,</i>


751
00:35:54.442 --> 00:35:56.444
<i>and then you get at the venue
and it's like go, go, go,</i>


752
00:35:56.478 --> 00:35:57.512
<i>and then you sit there
it's like,</i>


753
00:35:58.681 --> 00:35:59.648
<i>"Well, what do we do for
three hours now?"</i>


754
00:36:01.016 --> 00:36:02.184
<i>I dunno though.</i>

755
00:36:02.218 --> 00:36:03.886
<i>I think everyone on tour
got a little closer</i>


756
00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:05.487
<i>when we were waitin' around.</i>

757
00:36:10.993 --> 00:36:13.561
The first time I heard
someone play drums,


758
00:36:13.596 --> 00:36:15.363
I thought they were too loud.

759
00:36:21.336 --> 00:36:22.772
Then he kinda got into
the music scene,


760
00:36:22.805 --> 00:36:24.673
that was kind of
through Malcolm, and


761
00:36:25.373 --> 00:36:26.742
started learnin' to
play the drums.


762
00:36:26.776 --> 00:36:28.476
I would walk past
the bedroom window


763
00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:30.378
and there was my brother
playing drums.


764
00:36:30.411 --> 00:36:32.047
More hair than man.

765
00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:35.918
Playing drums like Animal
from the Muppet like.


766
00:36:39.521 --> 00:36:42.323
So when I was older
in my teenage years,


767
00:36:42.357 --> 00:36:44.627
after giving up on
guitar a small bit,


768
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.031
I was watching MTV, remember
when MTV played music videos?


769
00:36:51.399 --> 00:36:54.603
And one day,
Green Day came on TV.


770
00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:58.808
I think Green Day was
the biggest thing


771
00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:00.408
that sticks out in
my head with Sean.


772
00:37:00.441 --> 00:37:01.543
The "Boulevard
of Broken Dreams,"


773
00:37:01.576 --> 00:37:02.477
that was probably one
of the first...


774
00:37:02.812 --> 00:37:05.047
- Oh, my God!
- ...ones he ever played on.


775
00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.416
<i>This room was purpose-built
just for my drum kit.</i>


776
00:37:08.818 --> 00:37:11.519
<i>He got into a band and
like most of his childhood friends</i>


777
00:37:11.553 --> 00:37:13.388
<i>were in the band with him.</i>

778
00:37:13.421 --> 00:37:14.455
<i>Yeah, so that was cool.</i>

779
00:37:14.489 --> 00:37:16.792
Every house party that was
ever had at our house,


780
00:37:16.826 --> 00:37:17.827
everyone ended up
out in the shed


781
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.829
- listenin' to Seany on the drums.
- Yeah.


782
00:37:19.862 --> 00:37:21.931
I'd have the drum kit down
here in the corner


783
00:37:23.065 --> 00:37:24.066
playin' away.

784
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:28.369
And I played those big bad
bongos all day, every day.


785
00:37:28.403 --> 00:37:30.572
Oh my god, the same poster's
still here.


786
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.975
It's a 3D picture of
the moon landing.


787
00:37:33.008 --> 00:37:34.910
<i>But it was at this
moment in my life</i>


788
00:37:34.944 --> 00:37:37.378
it took its biggest turn ever,

789
00:37:37.412 --> 00:37:40.515
because I'd been going to
college for about two years


790
00:37:40.548 --> 00:37:41.951
for music production,

791
00:37:41.984 --> 00:37:45.654
and my family decided it
was time to move.


792
00:37:45.688 --> 00:37:48.389
So we ended up moving to a place
called Ballycumber


793
00:37:48.423 --> 00:37:50.826
to a log cabin
in the middle of the woods.


794
00:37:51.492 --> 00:37:54.864
As an 18 year old, not the best
environment for me,


795
00:37:54.897 --> 00:37:57.465
and when I was goin' to
college for two years,


796
00:37:57.633 --> 00:38:00.903
I realized that I wasn't
really able to keep up.


797
00:38:00.936 --> 00:38:03.606
Everybody else in my course
was phenomenal at it.


798
00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:05.440
They were all super
good at music,


799
00:38:05.473 --> 00:38:08.143
they were all able to pick up
the projects we were given,


800
00:38:08.177 --> 00:38:09.845
they were able to do
the music theory,


801
00:38:09.879 --> 00:38:13.548
and do everything fantastically,
but I wasn't able to.


802
00:38:13.581 --> 00:38:15.117
And because I was so
embarrassed,


803
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.653
I was too afraid to admit
that I was too dumb


804
00:38:17.686 --> 00:38:21.190
to be able to do this so I ended
up leaving college,


805
00:38:21.223 --> 00:38:22.858
and I went back to
this log cabin


806
00:38:22.892 --> 00:38:25.160
and completely lost myself.

807
00:38:25.194 --> 00:38:27.730
I had no idea who I was anymore.

808
00:38:27.897 --> 00:38:29.999
I became very heavily depressed.

809
00:38:30.032 --> 00:38:32.201
I didn't know
where I was gonna go in life.


810
00:38:32.234 --> 00:38:35.470
All these goals and aspirations
and things that I thought


811
00:38:35.503 --> 00:38:37.706
were supposed to happen
were all gone.


812
00:38:38.173 --> 00:38:39.742
What I thought I was
gonna do in life


813
00:38:39.775 --> 00:38:41.877
was that I would start off
in a small town,


814
00:38:41.911 --> 00:38:43.913
I would go to a slightly
bigger town for school,


815
00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:46.481
make some friends,
start playing drums,


816
00:38:46.649 --> 00:38:49.484
move off to the city for
college, and become a success,


817
00:38:49.785 --> 00:38:51.452
but that didn't happen.

818
00:38:51.486 --> 00:38:53.589
And I moved away from
all of my friends


819
00:38:53.756 --> 00:38:55.925
and people always say that's
fine if you move away


820
00:38:55.958 --> 00:38:58.459
from your friends 'cause you're
gonna make new friends,


821
00:38:58.827 --> 00:39:00.930
but that wasn't even
a possibility where I was living


822
00:39:00.963 --> 00:39:02.698
because we lived near nobody.

823
00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:03.832
I was completely alone.

824
00:39:03.866 --> 00:39:05.968
It was just me and
my family together,


825
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:10.839
and all I had to occupy my time
was video games and drums,


826
00:39:10.873 --> 00:39:12.207
and I didn't even want
to play those


827
00:39:12.241 --> 00:39:14.542
because I was just so miserable

828
00:39:14.575 --> 00:39:16.812
because I didn't know what else
to do with myself.


829
00:39:27.256 --> 00:39:28.824
<i>How are ya keepin'?</i>

830
00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:32.594
<i>You're above the ground,</i>

831
00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:33.862
<i>that's a good way to be.</i>

832
00:39:35.097 --> 00:39:36.065
<i>It's nice and warm.</i>

833
00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.667
<i>Mother said
she'd be back soon.</i>


834
00:39:39.702 --> 00:39:41.670
<i>He's 82 and a couple
of years ago,</i>


835
00:39:41.704 --> 00:39:43.238
<i>he was diagnosed with
Parkinson's.</i>


836
00:39:43.973 --> 00:39:46.541
He's just deteriorated so fast,

837
00:39:46.709 --> 00:39:49.845
and he's always been very active
my entire life growing up.


838
00:39:49.878 --> 00:39:50.980
He was always outside,

839
00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:53.115
he was always workin' with
his hands, he was very strong.


840
00:39:54.216 --> 00:39:54.850
I would always ask to see
his muscles and everything


841
00:39:55.851 --> 00:39:57.686
'cause he was so cool,
and he worked so hard,


842
00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.122
<i>but moving to that cabin
probably made him</i>


843
00:40:00.155 --> 00:40:01.724
<i>more depressed
than it made me.</i>


844
00:40:03.592 --> 00:40:04.927
This wasn't good.

845
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.996
<i>Nothing in my life will ever
get as dark as that time,</i>


846
00:40:07.229 --> 00:40:09.530
because that was
extreme isolation.


847
00:40:09.564 --> 00:40:10.833
That was extreme loneliness.

848
00:40:11.233 --> 00:40:13.068
We got this after like
a year of livin' here


849
00:40:13.102 --> 00:40:15.104
because when I would be
here during winter,


850
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.840
the ice would come in
on the walls up to about here.


851
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.676
So all the inside of the cabin
would all be frozen,


852
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.146
and the walls are literally
like as thin as that.


853
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.683
So this is the thickness of
the whole cabin.


854
00:40:29.284 --> 00:40:30.819
The whole way around.

855
00:40:30.853 --> 00:40:32.553
This is where my
recording setup was.


856
00:40:32.588 --> 00:40:36.592
So my bed was that way,
but I didn't have a bed frame.


857
00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:38.594
I had two mattresses just
lying on the ground,


858
00:40:38.894 --> 00:40:41.263
and my desk was here and
you can even still see


859
00:40:41.296 --> 00:40:45.134
the foam on the walls from
when I would record here.


860
00:40:45.901 --> 00:40:48.569
I used to use tacks
all the away around


861
00:40:48.604 --> 00:40:50.239
to put a black bed sheet
behind me,


862
00:40:50.973 --> 00:40:52.841
but it also segregated the cabin

863
00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:54.810
so that if I wanted to heat up
here at nighttime,


864
00:40:54.843 --> 00:40:56.845
I could just pull the bed sheet
down and keep the heat in.


865
00:40:57.179 --> 00:41:00.649
In like 2009, I think, we had
a really, really bad inter here,


866
00:41:00.682 --> 00:41:02.583
and all the pipes froze,

867
00:41:02.751 --> 00:41:05.020
because it's all like,
just under the ground.


868
00:41:05.054 --> 00:41:07.022
So all the water froze,
we had no water


869
00:41:07.056 --> 00:41:08.223
for two and a half weeks.

870
00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:09.691
When the water came back,

871
00:41:09.725 --> 00:41:11.794
the pipes up here all burst,

872
00:41:11.827 --> 00:41:14.596
and all the water came down
through the boards here


873
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.298
onto my computer and
my desk and everything.


874
00:41:16.832 --> 00:41:19.268
I like, caught it in time and
told them to turn it off again.


875
00:41:20.302 --> 00:41:21.637
Not a way to live.

876
00:41:23.772 --> 00:41:25.107
That's where it all started.

877
00:41:26.375 --> 00:41:28.043
And as you can see, you can
scream all you want out here.


878
00:41:29.711 --> 00:41:30.979
No one fuckin' knows.

879
00:41:31.013 --> 00:41:32.147
No one hears.

880
00:41:33.382 --> 00:41:34.349
<i>I think,
essentially, it was a release</i>


881
00:41:34.383 --> 00:41:36.685
<i>because he would have
gone crazy.</i>


882
00:41:36.718 --> 00:41:39.254
<i>He'd come home, cook
my folks dinner every day,</i>


883
00:41:39.421 --> 00:41:41.256
he was the model son,
and then he would go


884
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.092
and he would record
these videos.


885
00:41:43.725 --> 00:41:47.396
Hello, all you beautiful
people out there!


886
00:41:47.429 --> 00:41:51.133
My name is Jacksepticeye
and in this video,


887
00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:53.368
I'm gonna talk about
horror games.


888
00:41:53.402 --> 00:41:55.838
And I came back and my
mother said, "Oh, the other night


889
00:41:56.004 --> 00:41:57.840
I heard him and he was
screaming and shouting,


890
00:41:57.873 --> 00:41:59.108
I thought he was
being murdered."


891
00:41:59.741 --> 00:42:01.376
But he was in the cabin
next door at midnight,


892
00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.045
shouting at some horror game.

893
00:42:05.714 --> 00:42:06.381
<i>I think he forgot about the outside world.</i>

894
00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:08.517
I think he was so
immersed in this thing,


895
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:12.688
it was like his little secret
that he could come home to.


896
00:42:12.721 --> 00:42:15.090
It was like he stepped out
of the mundanity


897
00:42:15.124 --> 00:42:18.327
of every day life and the
mundanity of living in the woods,


898
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.263
with this captivating pastime.

899
00:42:21.997 --> 00:42:23.832
I think that's why YouTube
means so much to me,


900
00:42:23.866 --> 00:42:26.835
because I literally had nothing,

901
00:42:27.102 --> 00:42:29.671
and then this thing
comes along that makes me


902
00:42:29.705 --> 00:42:31.206
actually want to work.

903
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.842
It makes me happy and
passionate about something


904
00:42:33.876 --> 00:42:37.813
that I hadn't had before, and
had other people to talk to.


905
00:42:37.846 --> 00:42:39.381
There was an unhealthiness
to it,


906
00:42:39.414 --> 00:42:43.051
because it's that like, idea of
a parasocial relationship,


907
00:42:43.085 --> 00:42:46.255
that you latch onto these people
because you want friends,


908
00:42:46.288 --> 00:42:49.224
but back then, I was like,
very heavily dependent on that audience


909
00:42:49.258 --> 00:42:50.726
to get me through my days,

910
00:42:51.126 --> 00:42:52.895
because it was the only people
I had to talk to.


911
00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:55.797
I had no job.

912
00:42:55.831 --> 00:42:58.367
There was no available
jobs around.


913
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.369
I don't think I could have
gotten one if I did have,


914
00:43:00.402 --> 00:43:02.371
'cause I didn't drive,
I didn't have a car.


915
00:43:02.404 --> 00:43:04.439
So even if I got a job,
I couldn't get to it.


916
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.442
And there's no possibility of
gaining new friends here.


917
00:43:07.476 --> 00:43:09.678
Everybody in Ballycumber's
slightly older than me.


918
00:43:10.145 --> 00:43:12.181
So there was nobody to
hang around with.


919
00:43:12.414 --> 00:43:13.515
<i>Another thing about here,</i>

920
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:15.751
<i>the wind would just
come across the bog,</i>


921
00:43:15.784 --> 00:43:17.286
<i>and the whole place
would shake.</i>


922
00:43:17.486 --> 00:43:19.988
Like, you'd be in bed and
your bed would shake.


923
00:43:20.022 --> 00:43:21.190
Because the walls are so flimsy,

924
00:43:21.223 --> 00:43:23.125
the whole place would shake,

925
00:43:23.158 --> 00:43:24.860
<i>and then my dad was so
paranoid that the roof</i>


926
00:43:24.893 --> 00:43:27.462
would just fly off someday
because they're not,


927
00:43:27.496 --> 00:43:30.299
like... everything's flimsy.

928
00:43:33.335 --> 00:43:36.305
So it's easy to look back
and remember this


929
00:43:36.872 --> 00:43:39.074
and then be like yeah,
don't... don't become an asshole.


930
00:43:39.775 --> 00:43:41.877
Don't get used to that
lifestyle too much


931
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.013
or don't like, fly away or
become egotistical,


932
00:43:45.047 --> 00:43:47.816
because
the kid who grew up here


933
00:43:48.483 --> 00:43:51.286
would absolutely hate me
if I did that


934
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.055
because I have more now
than I ever have


935
00:43:53.088 --> 00:43:54.923
my entire life,
and I'm very, very lucky


936
00:43:54.957 --> 00:43:56.158
that I got anywhere.

937
00:43:57.292 --> 00:43:58.360
And I think that's why
I don't talk about it, 'cause...


938
00:43:59.995 --> 00:44:02.264
I'm not one to throw
a pity party for myself.


939
00:44:07.836 --> 00:44:09.838
I'm right with him.

940
00:44:13.542 --> 00:44:15.944
<i>Mental health was never
talked about in Ireland</i>


941
00:44:15.978 --> 00:44:17.079
<i>when I was growing up.</i>

942
00:44:20.482 --> 00:44:22.217
I don't like it.

943
00:44:23.485 --> 00:44:25.921
It's getting a lot better
but back then,


944
00:44:25.954 --> 00:44:27.990
it was really, really hard to
talk to anybody about it.


945
00:44:28.023 --> 00:44:29.191
That's why I left college,

946
00:44:29.224 --> 00:44:31.526
'cause I couldn't
admit to people


947
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.528
that I wasn't able to
do somethin.


948
00:44:33.562 --> 00:44:35.464
I couldn't admit to myself that
I wasn't able to do it


949
00:44:35.497 --> 00:44:38.066
because that made you seem
weak and stupid


950
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.401
and embarrassed and everything.

951
00:44:40.737 --> 00:44:43.138
<i>My family never emotionally
opening up to each other</i>


952
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:45.807
<i>and ever saying I love you
to one another,</i>


953
00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:48.510
<i>just not being able to talk
about what was going on</i>


954
00:44:48.543 --> 00:44:50.078
<i>inside your head.</i>

955
00:44:50.112 --> 00:44:51.046
<i>I feel like
that's the umbrella</i>


956
00:44:51.079 --> 00:44:52.881
<i>where everything else
falls under.</i>


957
00:44:53.482 --> 00:44:56.018
<i>We weren't good vocalizers
of our feelings,</i>


958
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:58.854
<i>and it was weird and it was
cringey and it was awkward.</i>


959
00:44:58.887 --> 00:45:00.255
<i>You just didn't want to do it.</i>

960
00:45:00.289 --> 00:45:03.392
As kids, we're not taught,
you know, coping mechanisms.


961
00:45:03.425 --> 00:45:05.527
We're not taught how to kinda
communicate our feelings.


962
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.829
- Yeah.
- A lot of men especially are taught like, nah,


963
00:45:07.863 --> 00:45:09.898
you should be macho and
hyper-masculine


964
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:11.500
and all that stuff,
and you kind of, uh,


965
00:45:11.533 --> 00:45:13.268
You can kinda quickly...
that's a slippery slope.


966
00:45:13.302 --> 00:45:14.569
You can kinda
quickly lose yourself


967
00:45:14.604 --> 00:45:16.038
because you're silent
about things.


968
00:45:17.572 --> 00:45:18.440
<i>Not being able to
verbalize what's going on with you</i>


969
00:45:19.074 --> 00:45:21.009
<i>is a very big issue.</i>

970
00:45:21.043 --> 00:45:22.911
<i>It sounds dumb on paper,</i>

971
00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:24.880
<i>but people need to be
able to talk about</i>


972
00:45:24.913 --> 00:45:26.181
<i>what's actually going
on with them,</i>


973
00:45:26.214 --> 00:45:27.382
<i>even if it sounds dumb
to some people.</i>


974
00:45:27.416 --> 00:45:29.284
<i>You need to be able
to open up to somebody.</i>


975
00:45:29.318 --> 00:45:30.419
<i>Not to get too sentimental,</i>

976
00:45:30.452 --> 00:45:32.321
but the worst feeling
on the planet


977
00:45:32.354 --> 00:45:34.556
- is feeling like you're the only one, you know?
- Yeah.


978
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.291
If you're having somethin'
that's goin' on


979
00:45:36.325 --> 00:45:38.427
that you feel just absolutely
devastated about,


980
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.696
you can't move through it,
you always think


981
00:45:39.729 --> 00:45:41.530
<i>"I'm the only person on Earth
who feels like this,"</i>


982
00:45:41.563 --> 00:45:43.398
<i>and that's the worst
feeling on Earth.</i>


983
00:45:43.432 --> 00:45:44.466
<i>The truth is you're not.</i>

984
00:45:45.768 --> 00:45:47.869
<i>And it's only now,
in hindsight as a grown man,</i>


985
00:45:47.903 --> 00:45:49.204
<i>that I can actually
admit that yeah,</i>


986
00:45:50.439 --> 00:45:52.007
<i>I was sad, I was depressed,
I was dealing with</i>


987
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.176
<i>a lot of stuff that I just
wasn't talking to anybody about.</i>


988
00:45:56.912 --> 00:45:58.246
<i>It's like
quintessential Ireland.</i>


989
00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.848
<i>It's like,
there is nothing else,</i>


990
00:46:00.215 --> 00:46:02.351
And you kinda just make the most
about what you have,


991
00:46:03.385 --> 00:46:05.520
but there's no ambition
to go any further.


992
00:46:07.255 --> 00:46:08.890
<i>That's why I knew
I couldn't stay here.</i>


993
00:46:09.224 --> 00:46:11.460
<i>It's grown a lot in
the last 10 years.</i>


994
00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.629
It's just that this part
of the country


995
00:46:13.995 --> 00:46:14.963
has not at all.

996
00:46:15.364 --> 00:46:16.632
<i>Which has its charm.</i>

997
00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:21.370
<i>And there's something very sort of
archaic and ritualistic about it.</i>


998
00:46:24.539 --> 00:46:27.476
<i>I was more just a product
of my surroundings,</i>


999
00:46:27.509 --> 00:46:29.144
<i>and my environment
and the people in it.</i>


1000
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.548
<i>I was drifting. I was trying
to figure out what I had to do.</i>


1001
00:46:38.353 --> 00:46:42.190
Luckily one day, my family
decided to get the internet


1002
00:46:42.224 --> 00:46:44.426
in these log cabins,
and I looked into a website


1003
00:46:44.459 --> 00:46:46.128
called YouTube.

1004
00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:54.503
And the thing about YouTube
at the time, for me,


1005
00:46:54.536 --> 00:46:57.172
was I had no idea it could
become a job for people.


1006
00:46:57.205 --> 00:46:59.174
I had no idea people did it
as their living.


1007
00:46:59.207 --> 00:47:01.243
It was a very
different time for me.


1008
00:47:01.276 --> 00:47:03.278
I just liked video games a lot.

1009
00:47:03.412 --> 00:47:05.514
So I ended up looking
up let's players


1010
00:47:05.547 --> 00:47:07.683
who were playing a lot of
Battlefield 3,


1011
00:47:08.183 --> 00:47:11.019
and I landed on a YouTuber
called Level Cap Gaming.


1012
00:47:11.286 --> 00:47:13.355
Here was this guy playing
a game he loved.


1013
00:47:13.388 --> 00:47:15.390
He was super
passionate about it,


1014
00:47:15.424 --> 00:47:18.393
but all these other people
showed up to watch him play.


1015
00:47:18.427 --> 00:47:20.696
They were all there
together watching him,


1016
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.531
sharing opinions,
and sharing thoughts


1017
00:47:22.698 --> 00:47:25.534
on video games together,
and I finally felt like


1018
00:47:25.567 --> 00:47:27.169
I had a place where I belonged,

1019
00:47:27.202 --> 00:47:29.404
because nobody knew
what that felt like


1020
00:47:29.438 --> 00:47:31.173
more than I did at that time.

1021
00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.541
To feel like a failure.

1022
00:47:32.574 --> 00:47:34.009
To feel like an outcast.

1023
00:47:34.042 --> 00:47:36.178
To feel like you had
nowhere else to turn.


1024
00:47:36.211 --> 00:47:38.213
Nobody else understood
who you were.


1025
00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:42.050
So I wanted to make a community
for people who felt like that.


1026
00:47:42.083 --> 00:47:44.419
Who felt like they needed a
place where they could hang out,


1027
00:47:44.553 --> 00:47:46.421
have fun, not feel judged.

1028
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:48.990
They could all just come around
and laugh together


1029
00:47:49.157 --> 00:47:50.760
and enjoy video games together.

1030
00:47:50.793 --> 00:47:52.695
The first time of my life
that I actually chose


1031
00:47:52.728 --> 00:47:55.397
to move somewhere else
myself was to Athlone


1032
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:57.332
<i>and that was thanks to
YouTube stuff.</i>


1033
00:48:01.403 --> 00:48:03.205
<i>Once I found that thing
that I wanted to do,</i>


1034
00:48:03.338 --> 00:48:05.474
it felt like okay,
this is the path, go,


1035
00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:07.209
and run as far as you
can with it.


1036
00:48:07.342 --> 00:48:11.580
Inksane. That's where I got
my Bloodborne tattoo.


1037
00:48:11.614 --> 00:48:13.482
I dunno, it kinda had
a professional look about it.


1038
00:48:14.149 --> 00:48:15.383
M
-O
-H
-H.

1039
00:48:15.417 --> 00:48:17.085
I went in there and
got my hair dyed green


1040
00:48:17.118 --> 00:48:18.153
for the first time,

1041
00:48:19.354 --> 00:48:20.155
and I was worried that they
wouldn't have green hair dye


1042
00:48:21.289 --> 00:48:23.358
because no one else ever
would dye their hair green.


1043
00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:27.028
Except me, of course,
'cause I'm an idiot YouTuber.


1044
00:48:27.195 --> 00:48:28.731
Top of the mornin' to ya, laddies!

1045
00:48:28.764 --> 00:48:31.566
My name is Jacksepticeye and I have a
few things to talk about in this vlog,


1046
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:33.301
but the first thing that you're
probably gonna notice,


1047
00:48:33.335 --> 00:48:35.738
from the high five,
is that I got a tattoo!


1048
00:48:36.204 --> 00:48:38.206
Can you see it? I... I... wait,
I don't know if you can see it.


1049
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.441
You can probably see
it better now.


1050
00:48:39.474 --> 00:48:41.376
Yeah, we can see the front
of it up this way.


1051
00:48:42.477 --> 00:48:46.448
I think the channel was at
like 60,000 subs


1052
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:47.482
when I moved in here?

1053
00:48:48.216 --> 00:48:49.584
And then by the time I left,

1054
00:48:49.619 --> 00:48:53.255
the channel was
at mid-teen millions.


1055
00:48:54.422 --> 00:48:56.124
In the space of a few years.

1056
00:48:56.157 --> 00:48:58.493
<i>That spot to be in
as a YouTuber,</i>


1057
00:48:58.828 --> 00:49:02.564
is such an interesting spot because
that's like, the big shift, right?


1058
00:49:02.598 --> 00:49:06.067
That's the shift where you see
there is an audience


1059
00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:08.570
<i>that completely validates
what you're doing,</i>


1060
00:49:08.604 --> 00:49:10.338
<i>and it's the all-in moment.</i>

1061
00:49:10.372 --> 00:49:12.507
This is it,
this is all there is. You know?


1062
00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:17.178
<i>Nothing else in my life gives
me what this is giving me.</i>


1063
00:49:17.212 --> 00:49:20.148
People see the millions and
they see the subscriber count


1064
00:49:20.181 --> 00:49:22.317
and they see the Instagram
and the Twitter,


1065
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:27.355
but he was lonely, and he was
workin' 15 hours a day.


1066
00:49:27.657 --> 00:49:29.725
And even when I wanted to
see him back home,


1067
00:49:29.759 --> 00:49:30.793
I had to make an appointment,

1068
00:49:30.826 --> 00:49:34.630
and I thought this is good
but it's all one way.


1069
00:49:34.797 --> 00:49:36.197
<i>It's a parasocial
relationship.</i>


1070
00:49:36.231 --> 00:49:39.401
<i>People are enjoying the stuff
that you're putting out there,</i>


1071
00:49:39.568 --> 00:49:42.872
but there's not a flow between
you and the audience,


1072
00:49:42.905 --> 00:49:45.507
and there's not a real
understanding of like,


1073
00:49:45.775 --> 00:49:48.209
you as a person and who you are.

1074
00:49:48.243 --> 00:49:50.111
It's the content that you're
putting out there,


1075
00:49:50.412 --> 00:49:52.213
<i>but it's very intoxicating.</i>

1076
00:49:52.247 --> 00:49:56.619
<i>For me at least, it gives me
something that I never got.</i>


1077
00:49:56.652 --> 00:49:59.454
<i>To have a bunch of people
come in and accept you,</i>


1078
00:49:59.689 --> 00:50:01.657
<i>I mean,
that's tremendously powerful.</i>


1079
00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:03.391
I was here alone for
a long time,


1080
00:50:03.425 --> 00:50:04.694
and I just stuck my head down

1081
00:50:04.727 --> 00:50:08.798
and just face to
the grindstone as I used to say


1082
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:10.398
in the show, but that
joke made no sense


1083
00:50:10.432 --> 00:50:13.101
so I had to change it.
Um...


1084
00:50:13.703 --> 00:50:16.137
But this is where I would work
all day, every day,


1085
00:50:16.171 --> 00:50:18.573
on YouTube, and never,
ever take any breaks,


1086
00:50:18.608 --> 00:50:19.609
and never go outside.

1087
00:50:20.776 --> 00:50:22.344
Only to get groceries and stuff,
'cause I didn't need to.


1088
00:50:23.511 --> 00:50:27.549
Other than that, I'd just sit at
home and record and work.


1089
00:50:29.919 --> 00:50:33.188
<i>YouTube itself is kind
of a social media platform.</i>


1090
00:50:33.488 --> 00:50:35.357
<i>The fact that it's so
accessible and it's free</i>


1091
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.760
<i>and anybody can have
their comment be seen,</i>


1092
00:50:37.793 --> 00:50:40.195
<i>it gives me a nice open
connection with everybody.</i>


1093
00:50:40.228 --> 00:50:42.832
<i>They're all super nice and
they're all very supportive</i>


1094
00:50:42.865 --> 00:50:44.600
<i>of each other,
but at the same time,</i>


1095
00:50:44.634 --> 00:50:45.835
<i>I have no idea who they are.</i>

1096
00:50:47.402 --> 00:50:49.304
<i>I just see usernames and profile
pictures and things like that.</i>


1097
00:50:50.538 --> 00:50:52.608
But whenever I record stuff and
I'm looking into a camera, and


1098
00:50:53.308 --> 00:50:55.243
even at a home
recording let's plays,


1099
00:50:55.276 --> 00:50:57.212
it still feels like
someone's there,


1100
00:50:57.245 --> 00:50:59.749
and I think having that open
access to each other


1101
00:50:59.782 --> 00:51:02.384
<i>and giving each other feedback
all the time is really important.</i>


1102
00:51:02.417 --> 00:51:06.756
It's not a conversation,
but I think it's close enough


1103
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:09.357
that's it still
very encouraging,


1104
00:51:09.391 --> 00:51:11.359
<i>and it feels like
he really is there.</i>


1105
00:51:11.393 --> 00:51:12.862
<i>It bridges a very big gap.</i>

1106
00:51:12.895 --> 00:51:15.530
There's always somebody
out there willing to listen,


1107
00:51:15.998 --> 00:51:18.233
and willing to open up
about their own life.


1108
00:51:18.266 --> 00:51:20.870
So it's fascinating.

1109
00:51:20.903 --> 00:51:23.471
It's so much more of a community

1110
00:51:23.505 --> 00:51:28.376
than people who are fans
of a TV show or fans of a band.


1111
00:51:29.377 --> 00:51:33.616
<i>And this is sometimes their
only interaction</i>


1112
00:51:33.649 --> 00:51:36.384
<i>with people who share
the same interest</i>


1113
00:51:36.418 --> 00:51:38.353
<i>outside of the internet.</i>

1114
00:51:38.386 --> 00:51:40.923
So it really feels
like they live


1115
00:51:40.956 --> 00:51:43.491
in this sort of
virtual existence,


1116
00:51:43.525 --> 00:51:47.495
and this is a real life,
three-dimensional way


1117
00:51:47.529 --> 00:51:49.632
<i>for them to experience that.</i>

1118
00:51:49.665 --> 00:51:51.767
It's always seeking a family.

1119
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:53.769
That's... that's what it's
all about, man.


1120
00:51:53.803 --> 00:51:55.403
It's always seeking a family.

1121
00:51:56.806 --> 00:51:57.707
<i>It's awesome to be able
to find other nerdy people</i>


1122
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.441
that are all into
the same things you are


1123
00:51:59.474 --> 00:52:00.643
and just be instant friends.

1124
00:52:00.676 --> 00:52:03.679
I made about five friends
just here right now, you know?


1125
00:52:03.713 --> 00:52:04.980
Never really had friends
growin' up,


1126
00:52:05.014 --> 00:52:06.682
so he's my go-to all the time.

1127
00:52:06.716 --> 00:52:08.216
So I love watching him.

1128
00:52:10.619 --> 00:52:11.821
College defeated me.

1129
00:52:11.854 --> 00:52:14.456
College was my huge obstacle,

1130
00:52:14.489 --> 00:52:16.558
but I decided I'm not gonna
let that happen.


1131
00:52:16.826 --> 00:52:18.460
I'm not gonna sit in
this log cabin,


1132
00:52:18.493 --> 00:52:19.662
I'm not gonna waste away,

1133
00:52:19.695 --> 00:52:21.931
I'm not gonna lose myself
anymore.


1134
00:52:21.964 --> 00:52:25.668
So I got back up on the horse
and I went back to college


1135
00:52:25.835 --> 00:52:28.436
for my true passion in life.

1136
00:52:29.972 --> 00:52:31.539
Hotel management.

1137
00:52:36.578 --> 00:52:39.048
I don't know why.

1138
00:52:39.081 --> 00:52:40.716
But when I went back to college,

1139
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:43.351
it was the next stage
of my life.


1140
00:52:43.719 --> 00:52:45.520
Adulthood.

1141
00:52:45.553 --> 00:52:47.823
Oh yeah.

1142
00:52:48.057 --> 00:52:49.992
You think adults know
what we're doing?


1143
00:52:50.492 --> 00:52:51.794
No!

1144
00:52:51.827 --> 00:52:52.962
Nope.

1145
00:52:52.995 --> 00:52:54.529
We just have the rest
of you tricked


1146
00:52:54.562 --> 00:52:57.032
into thinking we do.

1147
00:52:57.066 --> 00:52:58.500
When I was going
back to college,


1148
00:52:58.533 --> 00:52:59.902
I gave YouTube a try.

1149
00:52:59.935 --> 00:53:02.872
I really tried hard at it,
and even back then,


1150
00:53:02.905 --> 00:53:05.674
I was trying to upload two
videos every single day.


1151
00:53:05.808 --> 00:53:08.911
And after doing it for about
a year and a half,


1152
00:53:08.944 --> 00:53:10.880
people actually
started to show up,


1153
00:53:11.412 --> 00:53:13.883
and that's when stuff really
started to take off.


1154
00:53:19.622 --> 00:53:21.690
And I remember this
milestone vividly


1155
00:53:21.724 --> 00:53:24.359
because it was the first time
I ever met anyone


1156
00:53:24.392 --> 00:53:25.928
from the channel in real life.

1157
00:53:26.528 --> 00:53:28.631
I was going through
a grocery store in Ireland


1158
00:53:28.664 --> 00:53:29.665
called Tesco.

1159
00:53:30.666 --> 00:53:32.001
Tesco's right there and
my apartment's there.


1160
00:53:32.034 --> 00:53:34.904
I'd used to go all the way up and
around town to get down to it.


1161
00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:37.039
<i>And as I was goin'
through Tesco,</i>


1162
00:53:37.072 --> 00:53:39.875
two boys came up to me and
tapped me on the shoulder


1163
00:53:40.042 --> 00:53:41.877
and said,
"Are you Jacksepticeye?"


1164
00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:44.046
I'll show you exactly
where I met them.


1165
00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:46.949
And as I was standin' there
with a basket in my hand


1166
00:53:47.515 --> 00:53:49.685
full of baked beans and
instant noodles...


1167
00:53:49.919 --> 00:53:51.787
There's the baked beans I had.

1168
00:53:52.688 --> 00:53:54.522
And the two boys came up
to me right here.


1169
00:53:54.824 --> 00:53:56.391
I think it was right here.

1170
00:53:56.424 --> 00:53:57.626
The pictures are still
on my Instagram.


1171
00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.427
And I thought, oh shit!

1172
00:54:00.696 --> 00:54:01.797
They found me!

1173
00:54:11.006 --> 00:54:12.708
- We made it.
- Made it!


1174
00:54:14.276 --> 00:54:15.044
<i>People were speaking Dutch,
people were speaking French,</i>


1175
00:54:15.077 --> 00:54:16.045
<i>people were speaking German,</i>

1176
00:54:16.078 --> 00:54:17.980
<i>people were
speaking Norwegian,</i>


1177
00:54:18.013 --> 00:54:19.014
<i>tonight
they're speaking Danish,</i>


1178
00:54:19.048 --> 00:54:19.782
<i>tomorrow they're
speaking Swedish,</i>


1179
00:54:19.815 --> 00:54:20.883
<i>then they're speaking English,</i>

1180
00:54:20.916 --> 00:54:23.585
<i>so it's like seven
different languages</i>


1181
00:54:23.619 --> 00:54:24.820
<i>that we've gone through.</i>

1182
00:54:26.055 --> 00:54:27.723
<i>By and large, it still kind
of feels the same</i>


1183
00:54:27.756 --> 00:54:29.490
<i>'cause it's still
doing a tour.</i>


1184
00:54:30.826 --> 00:54:33.095
But it's definitely been a lot
colder here.


1185
00:54:33.561 --> 00:54:36.065
We landed on the plane and
it was actually snowing here


1186
00:54:36.098 --> 00:54:37.967
and I'm like come on,
that's fake.


1187
00:54:40.903 --> 00:54:42.137
<i>Today was pretty difficult.</i>

1188
00:54:43.072 --> 00:54:44.439
I threw up on an airplane.

1189
00:54:45.608 --> 00:54:46.407
Twice.

1190
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:49.544
Everyone in Amsterdam
is really nice,


1191
00:54:49.979 --> 00:54:53.115
and I just feel like an asshole.

1192
00:54:54.216 --> 00:54:56.118
- Hey, Vernon?
- Yes, sir!


1193
00:54:56.484 --> 00:54:57.920
Could you come here for
a second, please?


1194
00:54:57.953 --> 00:54:58.954
Got it.

1195
00:55:00.189 --> 00:55:01.156
Hey I'm Vernon Shaw and this
is how to put together a chair.


1196
00:55:02.057 --> 00:55:03.558
Please stop filming me.
That's step one.


1197
00:55:03.826 --> 00:55:05.560
We have two fortune cookies,

1198
00:55:05.895 --> 00:55:10.465
and me and John Peter here
are gonna dink and sink them,


1199
00:55:10.498 --> 00:55:13.936
and whatever comes out
in our... in our fortune


1200
00:55:14.103 --> 00:55:16.537
is gonna dictate
the rest of the tour.


1201
00:55:16.571 --> 00:55:19.975
Mine says, "Keep calm and
focus on the positive."


1202
00:55:21.677 --> 00:55:23.078
- "Cam"?
- All right.


1203
00:55:23.879 --> 00:55:25.147
Do you wanna
fuck back to Canada?


1204
00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:30.753
Mine says.

1205
00:55:37.092 --> 00:55:38.594
<i>What's your favorite thing</i>

1206
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:40.696
that you enjoy most about
Jack's channel?


1207
00:55:40.996 --> 00:55:42.631
Well, the scary games.

1208
00:55:42.665 --> 00:55:44.733
I really love that.

1209
00:55:44.767 --> 00:55:46.802
Yeah, I really love
Detroit: Become Human,


1210
00:55:46.835 --> 00:55:47.970
- it's so good.
- Yeah, same.


1211
00:55:48.003 --> 00:55:50.039
<i>Like, Jack always
makes me laugh.</i>


1212
00:55:50.239 --> 00:55:51.173
<i>No matter what.</i>

1213
00:55:51.206 --> 00:55:54.877
I can just want to die
and then I start up


1214
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:57.545
a Jacksepticeye video and
then my stomach hurts


1215
00:55:57.578 --> 00:55:58.681
from laughing too much.

1216
00:55:59.148 --> 00:56:00.149
<i>Europe's weird.</i>

1217
00:56:01.216 --> 00:56:02.618
<i>European audiences are
way more timid.</i>


1218
00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:04.219
<i>Like they want to make noise</i>

1219
00:56:04.253 --> 00:56:05.553
<i>and you can tell that
they're excited</i>


1220
00:56:05.586 --> 00:56:06.956
<i>'cause you can see it on
their faces and everything,</i>


1221
00:56:08.223 --> 00:56:09.325
<i>but they just don't want to
interrupt anything.</i>


1222
00:56:09.358 --> 00:56:10.592
<i>They're so used to just
being so polite,</i>


1223
00:56:10.626 --> 00:56:14.596
<i>but it's... once they get
into it, they're on board.</i>


1224
00:56:17.733 --> 00:56:19.702
This old lady looks like
she wants to fight me,


1225
00:56:20.235 --> 00:56:21.704
and I'm not okay with it.

1226
00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:24.707
"You want a knuckle sandwich,
kid?"


1227
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:28.210
It's really hard to get
comedians,


1228
00:56:28.576 --> 00:56:31.113
English-speaking comedians
to Germany because, uh,


1229
00:56:31.747 --> 00:56:33.015
probably they're not
gonna buy tickets


1230
00:56:34.482 --> 00:56:35.417
because they're just scared that they
don't get the jokes or something.


1231
00:56:35.451 --> 00:56:38.253
Yeah, no one thinks
German people can laugh.


1232
00:56:38.287 --> 00:56:41.056
Well, that's probably
another reason.


1233
00:56:45.594 --> 00:56:46.829
Are you from Berlin?

1234
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:49.131
No, no, no, no,
I live close to Cologne.


1235
00:56:49.832 --> 00:56:51.000
<i>Hey, Cologne's a cool town.</i>

1236
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.668
<i>Cologne is quite nice</i>

1237
00:56:53.936 --> 00:56:54.603
<i>because it's more like
a bigger village to be honest.</i>


1238
00:56:56.205 --> 00:56:57.906
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- But the people are really cool.</i>


1239
00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.309
<i>Really open
and really tolerant,</i>


1240
00:57:00.342 --> 00:57:04.579
<i>not so stiff as you're probably
used to from the Germans.</i>


1241
00:57:04.747 --> 00:57:07.282
<i>Yeah,
'cause even the live shows that we did,</i>


1242
00:57:07.316 --> 00:57:08.984
<i>'cause we did Cologne
and then here,</i>


1243
00:57:09.151 --> 00:57:12.254
and they were way nicer than
people made them sound.


1244
00:57:12.287 --> 00:57:13.288
Right.

1245
00:57:17.893 --> 00:57:19.194
<i>We're one third of
the way through.</i>


1246
00:57:19.995 --> 00:57:21.330
It feels like we've been
on the road forever.


1247
00:57:21.363 --> 00:57:22.664
It does.

1248
00:57:22.698 --> 00:57:23.899
What's your full name,
Vernon?


1249
00:57:23.932 --> 00:57:25.200
Oh, no, we're not doin'
an interview.


1250
00:57:25.234 --> 00:57:28.771
- We've got our two cameras ready.
- Nice fuckin' try!


1251
00:57:28.937 --> 00:57:31.707
- Hey, family.
- A clatter and a gobshite.


1252
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.175
That's all that's on this bus.

1253
00:57:33.208 --> 00:57:35.711
You're just lyin' to us.
You're just makin' up words.


1254
00:57:35.744 --> 00:57:38.080
I'm not tellin' you no fibs!

1255
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.782
I don't know,
it's the usual thing.


1256
00:57:39.815 --> 00:57:40.916
It's just tomfoolery and japes.

1257
00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:43.252
You spend a lot of time together
with a bunch of people,


1258
00:57:43.285 --> 00:57:45.254
and this is a very nice
group of people


1259
00:57:45.287 --> 00:57:47.990
with a sense of humor,
so it's just funny.


1260
00:57:48.023 --> 00:57:49.124
I enjoy it very much.

1261
00:57:49.158 --> 00:57:51.360
JP's ready
to fuckin' hang 10.


1262
00:57:51.393 --> 00:57:53.228
<i>I enjoy it when
it's a nice group of people</i>


1263
00:57:53.262 --> 00:57:55.097
<i>and there's a good
internal dynamic.</i>


1264
00:57:55.864 --> 00:57:58.033
And everybody's funny apart
from Stella.


1265
00:58:00.269 --> 00:58:02.004
I'm outta here! I quit!

1266
00:58:13.215 --> 00:58:14.950
<i>Jack's an
entertainer and I think that,</i>


1267
00:58:15.717 --> 00:58:18.253
<i>whether it's YouTube or
the radio or TV or podcast</i>


1268
00:58:18.387 --> 00:58:21.056
<i>or whatever, I think he'd get
his personality across.</i>


1269
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:25.327
And it's his personality and it's
his genuine sort of relationship


1270
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.931
with his audience that people
are coming to experience.


1271
00:58:29.865 --> 00:58:32.835
<i>I know what people go
through when they find a YouTuber</i>


1272
00:58:32.868 --> 00:58:34.002
<i>and what it means to...</i>

1273
00:58:34.036 --> 00:58:35.237
<i>'Cause watching a YouTuber
is not the same</i>


1274
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:36.672
<i>as watching TV.</i>

1275
00:58:36.705 --> 00:58:37.940
<i>You watch TV
to be entertained,</i>


1276
00:58:38.107 --> 00:58:40.242
<i>but most times,
people watch YouTubers</i>


1277
00:58:40.275 --> 00:58:43.378
<i>because they like the person
or they like the personality,</i>


1278
00:58:43.412 --> 00:58:46.281
<i>and they want to just be
involved in that friendship.</i>


1279
00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:48.283
Bye!

1280
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:50.152
Bye.

1281
00:58:51.386 --> 00:58:52.287
<i>It was eye-opening
to meet the crowd</i>


1282
00:58:53.522 --> 00:58:54.790
<i>and meet the people that were
coming to the shows.</i>


1283
00:58:55.891 --> 00:58:58.193
I found it really, it was quite
emotional actually,


1284
00:58:58.727 --> 00:59:01.830
<i>because it really feels like
a safe space for some people,</i>


1285
00:59:01.864 --> 00:59:04.700
and I was really touched by
how... how sincere they were.


1286
00:59:04.733 --> 00:59:06.135
You know, they're very,
very sincere.


1287
00:59:12.774 --> 00:59:14.843
The channel had been
doing so well,


1288
00:59:14.877 --> 00:59:17.179
and it'd suddenly become
the most subscribed channel


1289
00:59:17.212 --> 00:59:18.380
in Ireland.

1290
00:59:26.288 --> 00:59:30.058
So a newspaper decided
they were gonna do an article.


1291
00:59:30.092 --> 00:59:34.029
An article about the top 10 most
influential Irish people.


1292
00:59:37.266 --> 00:59:40.002
At number 10
on this prestigious list


1293
00:59:41.003 --> 00:59:42.070
was the president.

1294
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:57.286
At number nine,
was Bono from U2.


1295
00:59:59.888 --> 01:00:02.424
At number eight, was your boy.

1296
01:00:10.766 --> 01:00:12.901
Nothing like this had ever
happened before.


1297
01:00:13.035 --> 01:00:15.437
Never had anything like this
ever happen again,


1298
01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.873
but I try not to get too
far ahead of myself


1299
01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:20.042
because it was
a tabloid newspaper


1300
01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:22.377
and I didn't how many people
were actually gonna read it


1301
01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:23.879
or take it seriously.

1302
01:00:24.546 --> 01:00:27.049
But one day, the news called me.

1303
01:00:30.352 --> 01:00:32.521
The national news of
Ireland called me


1304
01:00:32.554 --> 01:00:34.990
because they had gotten
wind of the article.


1305
01:00:35.023 --> 01:00:37.125
It's what they do,
they're the fuckin' news.


1306
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.763
A man with the most Irish
name on planet Earth,


1307
01:00:42.164 --> 01:00:43.832
named Kieran Malooly.

1308
01:00:46.068 --> 01:00:48.337
Kieran sounds like
an Irish Kermit the frog.


1309
01:00:50.372 --> 01:00:52.040
So he called me and asked,

1310
01:00:53.308 --> 01:00:55.143
"How are ya, Seany?"

1311
01:00:57.479 --> 01:00:59.514
"Saw the article
you did in the paper


1312
01:00:59.548 --> 01:01:00.949
and thought it was great.

1313
01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:04.286
Just wonderin' if you wanted to
do an old interview


1314
01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:05.420
for the news."

1315
01:01:06.689 --> 01:01:08.957
I said no
problem, Kermit, I'd love to.


1316
01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.161
Again, cool opportunity.

1317
01:01:13.195 --> 01:01:14.930
Take it on board,
nothing to lose,


1318
01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:16.331
let's see what happens.

1319
01:01:16.365 --> 01:01:19.201
Now, where we were living
at the time in Athlone,


1320
01:01:19.368 --> 01:01:22.804
in Ireland, it had been
raining so badly


1321
01:01:22.838 --> 01:01:25.007
that the river Shannon
I lived next to


1322
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.877
got so full of water it said
hey, bro, I'm too full,


1323
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:31.847
<i>I'm just gonna burst my bank
and flood the town, cool?</i>


1324
01:01:33.248 --> 01:01:34.883
<i>No, not fuckin' cool!</i>

1325
01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:37.219
We decided we'd meet
outside a place


1326
01:01:37.386 --> 01:01:39.021
called Sean's Bar.

1327
01:01:43.959 --> 01:01:45.894
I told ya there was more of us.

1328
01:01:46.895 --> 01:01:49.331
Fun fact, Sean's Bar
once got an award


1329
01:01:49.364 --> 01:01:51.333
for being the oldest
pub in Europe.


1330
01:01:55.904 --> 01:01:59.041
<i>It dates back to
the year 900 AD.</i>


1331
01:02:01.043 --> 01:02:03.278
Yeah, trust the fuckin' Irish
to keep a pub alive


1332
01:02:03.312 --> 01:02:04.446
for that long.

1333
01:02:04.479 --> 01:02:06.181
My apartment is down there,

1334
01:02:07.082 --> 01:02:09.318
and when I decided I was gonna
do the interview,


1335
01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:11.586
we said we'd meet here because
it was like a...


1336
01:02:11.953 --> 01:02:13.288
it's a historical landmark.

1337
01:02:13.322 --> 01:02:15.591
It's not just like, famous for the
town, it's famous for Ireland.


1338
01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:17.292
<i>But because
the weather was so bad</i>


1339
01:02:17.326 --> 01:02:18.360
<i>and the place was flooded,</i>

1340
01:02:18.393 --> 01:02:20.596
I decided I'm gonna put on
me little welly boots,


1341
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:25.133
I'm gonna grab my umbrella
or my short priest.


1342
01:02:28.437 --> 01:02:30.439
And I'm gonna wait
outside Sean's Bar.


1343
01:02:30.572 --> 01:02:35.544
When I came down, this
whole section was all in water.


1344
01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:37.279
So I was standin' here
like, in wellies


1345
01:02:37.446 --> 01:02:38.914
with water up to my ankles.

1346
01:02:39.147 --> 01:02:41.016
Standin' with a fuckin'
umbrella in my hand,


1347
01:02:41.183 --> 01:02:43.151
waitin' for Kieran to show up.

1348
01:02:43.318 --> 01:02:44.453
I wonder what he drives?

1349
01:02:45.722 --> 01:02:46.355
I wonder when he's gonna get here?
I wonder where he is?


1350
01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:48.023
I wonder what he looks like?

1351
01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.925
We decided to meet at
two o'clock,


1352
01:02:50.459 --> 01:02:51.893
but two o'clock came,

1353
01:02:51.927 --> 01:02:53.596
Kieran didn't show up.

1354
01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.430
No, it's fine.

1355
01:02:55.464 --> 01:02:58.033
Bad weather, he's probably stuck
in traffic somewhere.


1356
01:02:58.701 --> 01:03:01.370
2:15 came, no sign of Kieran.

1357
01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:05.440
2:30 came, no Kieran.

1358
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:12.013
Three PM came and I said
fuck this, I'm not gettin' wet.


1359
01:03:13.649 --> 01:03:15.984
So I went back inside
and I gave Kieran


1360
01:03:16.017 --> 01:03:17.352
the benefit of the doubt.

1361
01:03:17.386 --> 01:03:18.587
He's probably dead.

1362
01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:22.924
Only logical explanation.

1363
01:03:22.958 --> 01:03:25.127
Bad weather,
tsunami probably killed him.


1364
01:03:27.229 --> 01:03:29.231
But just in case, I decided
to call the number


1365
01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:32.134
that he called me from,
and a lady picked up the phone,


1366
01:03:33.168 --> 01:03:35.337
and I asked her is Kieran here?

1367
01:03:35.504 --> 01:03:36.972
Did he come to do the interview?

1368
01:03:37.005 --> 01:03:38.540
I was waiting outside.

1369
01:03:38.573 --> 01:03:41.476
And she said, "Oh yeah,
Kieran drove down.


1370
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:45.648
Kieran's in town, but he decided
to not do that interview,


1371
01:03:45.681 --> 01:03:48.016
and went instead to do
a story about a lady


1372
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:49.951
whose garden got flooded."

1373
01:03:56.224 --> 01:03:57.993
- All right.
- How dare he?


1374
01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.296
So you called me,
blowin' smoke up my ass,


1375
01:04:01.329 --> 01:04:04.266
telling me I'm the eighth most
influential Irish person,


1376
01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.102
and you ditch me to do a story
about the fuckin' rain?


1377
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:12.274
That is the most Irish thing
that has ever happened to me.


1378
01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:17.979
Even if he came or we met here,

1379
01:04:18.013 --> 01:04:19.581
where was I gonna do
the interview?


1380
01:04:19.615 --> 01:04:21.082
In my apartment, here?

1381
01:04:22.451 --> 01:04:25.287
I'll talk about
my budding YouTube career


1382
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.290
standin' out in
the fuckin' rain.


1383
01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:30.091
The channel was just
doing so well.


1384
01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:32.662
I was just having so much fun
doing this YouTube thing.


1385
01:04:33.028 --> 01:04:35.163
I was doing it all day,
every day.


1386
01:04:35.564 --> 01:04:37.299
But there was one game
on the channel


1387
01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:39.201
that was doing better
than anything else.


1388
01:04:39.702 --> 01:04:42.571
A game that I've done
more episodes of


1389
01:04:42.605 --> 01:04:44.039
than any other game.

1390
01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:55.183
That game, of course,
being Happy Wheels!


1391
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.285
Oh, baby!

1392
01:05:00.489 --> 01:05:02.491
We're gonna pick out
three people to play.


1393
01:05:04.092 --> 01:05:05.728
<i>Even the time when
we played video games,</i>


1394
01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:07.663
cool, fun,
entertaining distraction,


1395
01:05:07.697 --> 01:05:10.031
but there's an actual
reason they're in it.


1396
01:05:10.065 --> 01:05:11.132
Okay, who wants to play?

1397
01:05:17.339 --> 01:05:19.341
<i>You get to see what it's like
to be a YouTuber.</i>


1398
01:05:19.474 --> 01:05:22.077
Oh, we have somebody.
Come on down!


1399
01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:24.312
<i>You get to practice it,
you get to shout yourself out</i>


1400
01:05:24.346 --> 01:05:25.480
<i>if you want to.</i>

1401
01:05:27.249 --> 01:05:28.450
What's your name?

1402
01:05:28.483 --> 01:05:30.018
- Kayley.
- Kayley?


1403
01:05:30.218 --> 01:05:31.319
Everyone say, "Hi, Kayley."

1404
01:05:31.353 --> 01:05:33.288
Hi, Kayley!

1405
01:05:33.522 --> 01:05:35.725
- Was that scary?
- No.


1406
01:05:35.758 --> 01:05:37.627
<i>People often don't take
kids seriously.</i>


1407
01:05:37.827 --> 01:05:39.194
<i>So we wanted to give them
the limelight</i>


1408
01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:42.397
<i>and to give them a chance to
like, be heard and be seen,</i>


1409
01:05:42.765 --> 01:05:44.600
<i>and even the audience
who doesn't know anything</i>


1410
01:05:44.634 --> 01:05:47.770
<i>about this, can actually
get to see what it's like</i>


1411
01:05:47.803 --> 01:05:48.871
<i>and see why people like it</i>

1412
01:05:48.905 --> 01:05:50.338
<i>and see why it's such
a communal thing,</i>


1413
01:05:50.372 --> 01:05:51.774
<i>it's such an energetic thing.</i>

1414
01:05:51.807 --> 01:05:53.308
<i>The people who are
into it already</i>


1415
01:05:53.341 --> 01:05:54.610
<i>get so much more out of it.</i>

1416
01:05:55.343 --> 01:05:56.746
Everyone say, "Hi, Roman."

1417
01:05:56.779 --> 01:05:59.147
- Hi, Roman!
- Hi!


1418
01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.283
Roman, do you have
a YouTube name?


1419
01:06:01.316 --> 01:06:03.418
- Yes.
- What's your YouTube name?


1420
01:06:03.451 --> 01:06:04.553
Fart.

1421
01:06:09.692 --> 01:06:11.493
Did you just come up with
that right now?


1422
01:06:11.526 --> 01:06:14.195
- No.
- Your YouTube name is Fart?


1423
01:06:15.363 --> 01:06:16.699
Is that actually your
YouTube name?


1424
01:06:17.633 --> 01:06:19.702
I think you're lying.

1425
01:06:19.902 --> 01:06:23.138
You know what? I love it
anyway, sorry, parents.


1426
01:06:24.406 --> 01:06:26.207
Corrupting the youth, okay.

1427
01:06:26.575 --> 01:06:28.678
We're all just gonna chant fart.

1428
01:06:30.145 --> 01:06:34.382
Fart! Fart! Fart!
Fart! Fart!


1429
01:06:34.416 --> 01:06:37.753
- Louder!
- Fart! Fart! Fart! Fart! Fart!


1430
01:06:37.787 --> 01:06:41.289
- Fart! Fart! Fart! Fart! Fart!
- Oh!


1431
01:06:41.757 --> 01:06:44.125
Okay, click on play now
and let's go.


1432
01:06:44.159 --> 01:06:45.327
You know how to play, right?

1433
01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.762
Okay, go forwards.

1434
01:06:46.796 --> 01:06:48.831
Go forward, here we go!

1435
01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:50.265
Oh!

1436
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.467
That's okay, that's fine.

1437
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.202
Slow start.

1438
01:06:54.235 --> 01:06:57.372
Okay, just remember,
speed is key!


1439
01:06:57.405 --> 01:06:59.775
Go!

1440
01:07:01.376 --> 01:07:03.613
We'll give it one more try,
how does that sound?


1441
01:07:03.646 --> 01:07:06.247
Go, Fart, go!
You got this, buddy!


1442
01:07:08.684 --> 01:07:10.285
Yes, yes!

1443
01:07:11.519 --> 01:07:12.520
Yes!

1444
01:07:14.222 --> 01:07:15.523
Go, Fart!

1445
01:07:26.769 --> 01:07:27.770
What?

1446
01:07:35.778 --> 01:07:37.278
Go, Fart, go!

1447
01:07:38.279 --> 01:07:39.782
Okay, okay, I don't like this!

1448
01:08:00.268 --> 01:08:01.704
<i>Paris was a cool one.</i>

1449
01:08:06.676 --> 01:08:07.810
<i>Because my brother
lives there,</i>


1450
01:08:09.577 --> 01:08:10.245
<i>it's always been a place that I've
kind of wanted to go and hang out,</i>


1451
01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:12.380
<i>and he's been there
so long at this point</i>


1452
01:08:12.414 --> 01:08:14.516
<i>that he knows
the place inside out</i>


1453
01:08:14.684 --> 01:08:15.785
<i>and he loves it so much.</i>

1454
01:08:15.818 --> 01:08:17.787
San Michel is down there.

1455
01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.522
So tomorrow we're gonna
cruise down there,


1456
01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.290
and we'll go over here
to the Louvre.


1457
01:08:24.259 --> 01:08:27.830
Tonight, we're a few hours
away from the first time


1458
01:08:27.863 --> 01:08:30.866
I'm gonna see the How Did
We Get Here show.


1459
01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.802
<i>So havin' worked on
ideas together,</i>


1460
01:08:32.968 --> 01:08:34.569
<i>I'm super stoked to actually
see what the thing</i>


1461
01:08:34.737 --> 01:08:35.738
<i>is gonna be like.</i>

1462
01:08:36.906 --> 01:08:40.710
<i>My kid brother is in
a thousand-seater venue</i>


1463
01:08:40.743 --> 01:08:44.279
in one of the most
touristic parts of Paris,


1464
01:08:44.312 --> 01:08:46.247
<i>and he's gonna
headline a show.</i>


1465
01:08:46.281 --> 01:08:47.449
<i>There's all these
fans outside,</i>


1466
01:08:47.482 --> 01:08:50.251
<i>rabid to even get a picture
taken with him.</i>


1467
01:08:50.285 --> 01:08:51.654
Thank you so much!

1468
01:08:51.821 --> 01:08:53.521
- Oh!
- How do you say that?


1469
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:56.524
A piece of home.
It's a clover, yeah.


1470
01:08:56.558 --> 01:08:57.660
<i>Just talking to them
outside and everything</i>


1471
01:08:59.327 --> 01:09:02.363
I'm like okay, yeah, there's gonna be a
language barrier for a lot of these jokes.


1472
01:09:02.397 --> 01:09:03.632
- Just pace it.
- Yeah.


1473
01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:05.467
Yeah, it was weird
'cause some of the stuff


1474
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.037
from last night, like, some of
the Amsterdam crowd


1475
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:09.905
they were into some of it
and then other parts


1476
01:09:09.939 --> 01:09:13.642
it was like, really subdued
and they didn't like sustain


1477
01:09:13.809 --> 01:09:15.678
as long as like an American
crowd did.


1478
01:09:15.911 --> 01:09:17.012
It was like they
started cheering


1479
01:09:18.246 --> 01:09:19.615
and then all of a sudden it was
like yeah okay, we're done.


1480
01:09:19.648 --> 01:09:22.017
<i>It'll be interesting to see if
some of the jokes land or not,</i>


1481
01:09:22.051 --> 01:09:24.586
<i>because it's a lot of
like, Irish humor,</i>


1482
01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.622
<i>and I don't know if it's gonna
translate very well.</i>


1483
01:09:27.522 --> 01:09:29.457
I don't know, part of the fun
of doing a live show


1484
01:09:29.491 --> 01:09:30.893
and touring and
figuring things out.


1485
01:09:30.926 --> 01:09:31.927
It's a challenge.

1486
01:09:32.928 --> 01:09:33.929
I enjoy it.

1487
01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:36.799
Are you guys excited
for Jacksepticeye?


1488
01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.401
<i>Because he's so famous,</i>

1489
01:09:41.737 --> 01:09:42.938
<i>I think he could come out
on stage and do anything.</i>


1490
01:09:44.006 --> 01:09:44.740
<i>He just wants to push
the boundaries.</i>


1491
01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.610
My wife, we were
dating at the time


1492
01:09:47.643 --> 01:09:48.778
and she was living in Germany,

1493
01:09:48.811 --> 01:09:50.646
and she sent me
this video and said,


1494
01:09:50.913 --> 01:09:52.815
<i>"You've gotta see what
your brother is doing."</i>


1495
01:09:54.817 --> 01:09:56.919
<i>When we went back, if I wanted
to have a coffee with him</i>


1496
01:09:56.952 --> 01:09:59.021
<i>or go out, people were
just turnin' up</i>


1497
01:09:59.054 --> 01:10:00.355
<i>to get selfies.</i>

1498
01:10:00.656 --> 01:10:01.757
Yeah, it was unbelievably good.

1499
01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:04.026
Unbelievably good.
And the French, man,


1500
01:10:04.059 --> 01:10:05.360
they surprised me.

1501
01:10:05.393 --> 01:10:06.394
Yeah, they loved that.

1502
01:10:07.395 --> 01:10:08.264
The secret is that you have
to drop your mic


1503
01:10:08.296 --> 01:10:09.765
from your mouth after
you tell a joke,


1504
01:10:09.932 --> 01:10:11.700
'cause they were like
oh, I clap now?


1505
01:10:11.734 --> 01:10:12.802
Cool.

1506
01:10:13.869 --> 01:10:15.738
It's been fun to watch him
grow from a distance,


1507
01:10:15.771 --> 01:10:18.774
<i>but at the same time,
we've remained really close</i>


1508
01:10:18.808 --> 01:10:19.809
throughout the years.

1509
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:57.780
<i>I think Paris is one of
the most historically dense</i>


1510
01:10:57.813 --> 01:10:59.414
<i>cities on the entire planet,</i>

1511
01:10:59.447 --> 01:11:01.549
<i>and the fact that we had
somebody who knew</i>


1512
01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:02.751
<i>some of the background
to these places</i>


1513
01:11:02.785 --> 01:11:05.553
<i>and it felt like we were on
this personally</i>


1514
01:11:05.688 --> 01:11:07.823
<i>private guided tour of Paris.</i>

1515
01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:11.660
<i>And then we all just got to
recharge our batteries,</i>


1516
01:11:11.694 --> 01:11:14.096
<i>and stuff like that is just
really, really nice.</i>


1517
01:11:14.997 --> 01:11:17.633
<i>But the fact that we get to
go there on tour</i>


1518
01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:20.769
<i>all as a group,
made it so much better,</i>


1519
01:11:21.704 --> 01:11:24.439
<i>and it's gonna be hard to top
those kinds of moments.</i>


1520
01:11:50.766 --> 01:11:52.467
Oh my God, look at that.

1521
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.702
It's all of
my thumbnails...


1522
01:11:53.869 --> 01:11:55.004
Oh, come on!

1523
01:11:56.772 --> 01:11:57.973
- From his videos.
- And the videos they've watched and quotes from them.


1524
01:11:58.841 --> 01:12:00.441
Holy shit!

1525
01:12:00.475 --> 01:12:01.677
She showed it to me outside.

1526
01:12:02.978 --> 01:12:04.512
- It's fuckin' incredible.
<i>- Lovely dude.</i>


1527
01:12:04.545 --> 01:12:06.447
<i>Genuinely very nice guy,</i>

1528
01:12:06.481 --> 01:12:09.685
and he's in a strange position
because I've never seen


1529
01:12:09.718 --> 01:12:13.889
an artist have that much
weight put on him,


1530
01:12:13.923 --> 01:12:16.025
because people expect
a lot from him.


1531
01:12:16.058 --> 01:12:19.628
<i>It's like, "You've helped me,
you've saved me."</i>


1532
01:12:19.662 --> 01:12:22.430
<i>He takes it in his stride and
he does really well, I think.</i>


1533
01:12:22.631 --> 01:12:23.933
Oh my God, I'm gonna cry!

1534
01:12:24.099 --> 01:12:25.901
All good performance
is a collusion


1535
01:12:25.935 --> 01:12:27.770
between the artist and
the audience.


1536
01:12:27.803 --> 01:12:29.838
Oh no, it's not workin'!
Oh, good!


1537
01:12:32.741 --> 01:12:33.541
<i>If you put
the artist and the audience</i>


1538
01:12:33.574 --> 01:12:35.878
in the best possible
frame of mind,


1539
01:12:36.045 --> 01:12:37.746
<i>you sometimes get these
really nice moments.</i>


1540
01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.781
Yes!

1541
01:12:40.249 --> 01:12:42.618
Jeff, you had the courage

1542
01:12:42.785 --> 01:12:44.485
to do exactly
what you wanted to do.


1543
01:12:44.519 --> 01:12:46.021
Do you feel accomplished?

1544
01:12:46.055 --> 01:12:47.122
I do, almost.

1545
01:12:47.156 --> 01:12:49.024
There's one other thing
I'd like to do.


1546
01:12:49.925 --> 01:12:50.993
What do you want to do, Jeff?

1547
01:12:52.962 --> 01:12:55.030
If that girl could come
up to the stage,


1548
01:12:55.064 --> 01:12:57.800
she knows who she is.

1549
01:12:57.833 --> 01:13:01.203
<i>And that's why live
performance is endlessly fascinating</i>


1550
01:13:01.236 --> 01:13:02.938
<i>because you never know
what's gonna happen.</i>


1551
01:13:14.984 --> 01:13:16.584
Edinburgh.

1552
01:13:21.123 --> 01:13:22.958
<i>The thing I love most
about this tour</i>


1553
01:13:22.992 --> 01:13:24.259
<i>is... is truly just kind of
the bus.</i>


1554
01:13:25.995 --> 01:13:28.563
- <i>♪ Sunday, Sunday... ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Monday, happy days! ♪</i>


1555
01:13:29.865 --> 01:13:31.100
What a lovely day.

1556
01:13:32.334 --> 01:13:33.235
<i>There's not a bad
attitude in the bunch,</i>


1557
01:13:34.403 --> 01:13:35.771
<i>and it's also just
the communal experience</i>


1558
01:13:35.804 --> 01:13:38.674
<i>of seeing different countries
together with your friends.</i>


1559
01:13:38.707 --> 01:13:40.642
<i>Seeing the fans' reactions
to all this stuff</i>


1560
01:13:40.676 --> 01:13:41.944
<i>has been amazing.</i>

1561
01:13:43.112 --> 01:13:43.979
<i>I will remember it
for the rest of my life.</i>


1562
01:13:49.018 --> 01:13:50.252
I don't know,
it just reminds me of like,


1563
01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.255
it's all the stuff you take for granted
as a kid when you like walk around,


1564
01:13:54.857 --> 01:13:58.994
and you just walk across like, graveyards
and fields and trees and everything,


1565
01:13:59.028 --> 01:14:03.332
but it's only when you get
older you see somebody


1566
01:14:03.365 --> 01:14:05.601
when you live in a city
or a town or something,


1567
01:14:05.634 --> 01:14:07.002
and you don't get to see
that stuff anymore,


1568
01:14:07.036 --> 01:14:08.270
and then when you
come back to it,


1569
01:14:08.303 --> 01:14:10.773
it just reminds me of
being a kid again.


1570
01:14:12.975 --> 01:14:15.177
I've never been one to have much
patriotism for Ireland


1571
01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:20.149
but... I don't know, now that
I have some distance from it


1572
01:14:20.182 --> 01:14:21.582
I actually miss it a lot.

1573
01:14:23.352 --> 01:14:26.655
<i>I've spent so long just
working and figuring things out</i>


1574
01:14:26.688 --> 01:14:29.258
<i>that I haven't taken the time
to actually figure out</i>


1575
01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:32.895
<i>who I am 100 percent
and I'm excited to do that</i>


1576
01:14:33.062 --> 01:14:35.931
<i>rolling into like,
my early 30's.</i>


1577
01:14:38.033 --> 01:14:40.302
A lot of people use
an audience and fame


1578
01:14:40.335 --> 01:14:43.672
and growth to patch over
those holes in their life.


1579
01:14:43.705 --> 01:14:45.941
Maybe I was doing that for
a long time as well myself, but


1580
01:14:47.676 --> 01:14:51.080
you have to find what makes
you just base level content


1581
01:14:51.647 --> 01:14:52.648
at the end of the day.

1582
01:14:53.782 --> 01:14:56.085
And no amount of like,
popularity or anything like that


1583
01:14:56.118 --> 01:14:57.585
is ever gonna do that for you.

1584
01:14:58.987 --> 01:15:01.056
<i>I hear a lot of stories from
people who are as depressed</i>


1585
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:02.724
if not more than
I was back then,


1586
01:15:03.225 --> 01:15:04.827
who are just trying to
find themselves,


1587
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.261
they're trying to figure out
what they want to do,


1588
01:15:06.862 --> 01:15:08.797
so to just show them like,
it's okay,


1589
01:15:08.831 --> 01:15:10.199
you're allowed to feel this way.

1590
01:15:10.966 --> 01:15:13.135
<i>I felt this way at this
point in my life.</i>


1591
01:15:13.969 --> 01:15:15.838
<i>A lot of people in this room
here with you right now</i>


1592
01:15:15.871 --> 01:15:17.339
<i>are feeling
the exact same thing,</i>


1593
01:15:18.207 --> 01:15:20.876
<i>but like a video game,
you fight the badness</i>


1594
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:23.078
<i>and then you get
the experience in your life</i>


1595
01:15:23.112 --> 01:15:24.746
<i>and you move onto
the next part.</i>


1596
01:15:35.958 --> 01:15:37.860
<i>I haven't really
thought about the end of it.</i>


1597
01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:41.830
<i>It will be really sad when
we have to retire the show,</i>


1598
01:15:42.965 --> 01:15:47.102
<i>but it will be kind of cool to
just end the show in Dublin</i>


1599
01:15:47.136 --> 01:15:48.137
<i>and leave it there.</i>

1600
01:15:49.872 --> 01:15:50.873
It's strange.

1601
01:15:52.241 --> 01:15:53.842
I think it's more strange
because of the fact


1602
01:15:53.876 --> 01:15:55.010
it's in a college.

1603
01:15:55.043 --> 01:16:00.048
A lot of the story in the show
revolves around college


1604
01:16:00.082 --> 01:16:02.117
and failing college and
not knowing what


1605
01:16:02.151 --> 01:16:04.153
you're gonna do with yourself,
and then to come back here


1606
01:16:04.186 --> 01:16:05.454
to have one of the final...

1607
01:16:05.487 --> 01:16:07.890
to have the final show here
surrounded by people


1608
01:16:07.923 --> 01:16:09.691
<i>who are all going through that
transitional period</i>


1609
01:16:09.892 --> 01:16:11.160
- <i>in their life.</i>
- Thanks.


1610
01:16:12.461 --> 01:16:13.495
<i>And how many of them
are actually gonna end up</i>


1611
01:16:13.529 --> 01:16:15.864
doing what they're studying,
and how many of them


1612
01:16:15.898 --> 01:16:16.999
are actually gonna go on

1613
01:16:17.032 --> 01:16:18.400
and do something
completely different.


1614
01:16:20.169 --> 01:16:22.404
How many other YouTubers
are out here?


1615
01:16:23.405 --> 01:16:25.140
Also nice to hear Irish
accents again.


1616
01:16:25.774 --> 01:16:27.142
My one's gonna start gettin'
thicker now


1617
01:16:27.276 --> 01:16:28.277
as we go through here.

1618
01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:36.285
Comin' straight for me!

1619
01:16:41.056 --> 01:16:42.391
<i>It turned into
a better show</i>


1620
01:16:42.424 --> 01:16:43.825
<i>than I thought
it was going to.</i>


1621
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.195
<i>We spent so long making it
and I'm so proud of it</i>


1622
01:16:46.228 --> 01:16:49.198
<i>and I've been blown away
by everybody else</i>


1623
01:16:49.231 --> 01:16:51.934
<i>backstage who's been able to
keep it running and everything.</i>


1624
01:16:52.201 --> 01:16:54.403
<i>The fact that I got to go
out and meet so many</i>


1625
01:16:54.436 --> 01:16:57.306
<i>of the people from the channel,
like the community itself,</i>


1626
01:16:57.339 --> 01:16:58.407
<i>and not just at a convention,</i>

1627
01:16:59.676 --> 01:17:00.643
<i>but actually being able to see
them in front of you</i>


1628
01:17:00.677 --> 01:17:02.778
<i>and react to
the thing you're doing</i>


1629
01:17:02.811 --> 01:17:05.080
<i>that you're always kind of
doing live,</i>


1630
01:17:05.113 --> 01:17:06.315
<i>was such a huge thing for me.</i>

1631
01:17:06.348 --> 01:17:09.084
<i>That filled me with so much
joy and happiness,</i>


1632
01:17:09.117 --> 01:17:11.453
<i>but also being able to be on
a bus with people</i>


1633
01:17:11.486 --> 01:17:14.923
<i>and create proper, life-long,
close-bonded friendships</i>


1634
01:17:14.957 --> 01:17:15.958
<i>with people.</i>

1635
01:17:17.259 --> 01:17:18.260
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1636
01:17:18.527 --> 01:17:19.728
<i>It's a journey.</i>

1637
01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:22.264
<i>It's a journey through life
and its obstacles</i>


1638
01:17:22.297 --> 01:17:26.034
<i>and achieving greatness
above those obstacles.</i>


1639
01:17:29.171 --> 01:17:30.472
<i>It doesn't make
any difference to me,</i>


1640
01:17:30.505 --> 01:17:33.208
he's still Sean to me and
whatever he has, he has,


1641
01:17:33.242 --> 01:17:35.510
and I'm just happy for him.

1642
01:17:35.877 --> 01:17:38.213
He's my brother.
I don't look at him as this big star or...


1643
01:17:38.247 --> 01:17:39.314
Yeah, same.

1644
01:17:39.348 --> 01:17:41.750
I'm just very proud of him
and what he's achieved.


1645
01:17:42.584 --> 01:17:44.519
<i>He takes time for everybody</i>

1646
01:17:44.553 --> 01:17:46.922
<i>and that's what
his heart beats for.</i>


1647
01:17:46.955 --> 01:17:48.423
It's okay, I'll just stay
holdin' onto him.


1648
01:17:48.824 --> 01:17:51.827
It beats for the people
and that's just rare,


1649
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:53.028
I think, in this world.

1650
01:17:54.129 --> 01:17:56.298
Exactly the same now as you
were 15-20 years ago.


1651
01:17:56.565 --> 01:17:58.567
<i>Just keep being
who you are and you'll get to</i>


1652
01:17:58.601 --> 01:18:00.002
<i>where you actually want to be.</i>

1653
01:18:10.545 --> 01:18:13.415
<i>Sadly, we've come to
the end of our show.</i>


1654
01:18:16.451 --> 01:18:17.953
You guys had fun, right?

1655
01:18:23.025 --> 01:18:24.026
Thank God!

1656
01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.162
I see Vernon over
there going no.


1657
01:18:29.931 --> 01:18:32.134
But as I said at
the start of the show,


1658
01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:33.535
we were gonna go
through a journey,


1659
01:18:33.568 --> 01:18:36.872
and now you have seen various
aspects of my life


1660
01:18:36.905 --> 01:18:38.307
through different
periods of my life.


1661
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.275
From the very beginning
all the way up to


1662
01:18:40.309 --> 01:18:42.010
whatever the fuck this is.

1663
01:18:43.945 --> 01:18:46.148
And I asked you guys one
simple question


1664
01:18:46.181 --> 01:18:47.582
which was how did we get here?

1665
01:18:48.317 --> 01:18:50.052
And the reason that we are here,

1666
01:18:50.085 --> 01:18:53.288
the reason that I am up here
doing any of this right now,


1667
01:18:53.322 --> 01:18:55.324
is because of all of you
lovely people.


1668
01:19:05.668 --> 01:19:07.536
There is no way that I
would be able


1669
01:19:07.569 --> 01:19:10.339
to do this kind of thing or
even do YouTube at all


1670
01:19:10.505 --> 01:19:12.574
or be half the person I am today

1671
01:19:13.008 --> 01:19:14.910
if it wasn't for everybody who
watches the channel.


1672
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:17.412
So whether you're here in
this room tonight,


1673
01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.515
whether you're at home, whether
you came to the channel


1674
01:19:20.549 --> 01:19:23.118
and left at some point, even if
you came to the channel


1675
01:19:23.151 --> 01:19:25.354
and hated it, at least you
gave it a chance,


1676
01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.657
and for that, I am
forever grateful,


1677
01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:29.491
and I can never thank
you all enough.


1678
01:19:29.524 --> 01:19:31.560
Thank you so much.

1679
01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:44.607
I fucking love you!

1680
01:19:51.346 --> 01:19:52.547
When I was in that log cabin,

1681
01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:54.449
I became so depressed
that I didn't know


1682
01:19:54.483 --> 01:19:57.419
what I was gonna do with the
rest of my life,


1683
01:19:57.452 --> 01:19:58.954
but that does not matter.

1684
01:19:58.987 --> 01:20:01.657
What matters is that you
keep fighting,


1685
01:20:01.691 --> 01:20:03.626
is that you keep
pushing forward,


1686
01:20:03.659 --> 01:20:05.628
because we all go
through our problems.


1687
01:20:05.994 --> 01:20:08.497
We all have problems whether it
be small or large,


1688
01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:11.266
it does not matter, we're all
going through it,


1689
01:20:11.299 --> 01:20:12.668
and the thing about all of this

1690
01:20:12.702 --> 01:20:15.638
and the reason that I got up
here to tell this story,


1691
01:20:15.671 --> 01:20:18.006
specifically my story,
was to show you


1692
01:20:18.039 --> 01:20:20.643
that I did not come from
anywhere special.


1693
01:20:20.676 --> 01:20:23.613
I did not come from a
very popular place


1694
01:20:23.646 --> 01:20:25.080
or anything like that.

1695
01:20:25.113 --> 01:20:26.581
But that doesn't matter either.

1696
01:20:26.616 --> 01:20:28.283
It doesn't matter where
you come from.


1697
01:20:28.316 --> 01:20:30.051
Doesn't matter what
you look like.


1698
01:20:30.085 --> 01:20:31.586
It doesn't matter what
gender you are.


1699
01:20:31.621 --> 01:20:33.955
It doesn't matter if you're
straight, gay, bi,


1700
01:20:33.989 --> 01:20:35.591
or anything in between.

1701
01:20:42.698 --> 01:20:45.100
And I know I'm
literally talking down


1702
01:20:45.133 --> 01:20:49.004
to a lot of you, but I hope that
it never feels like that,


1703
01:20:49.037 --> 01:20:51.039
because the thing I take away
from doing YouTube


1704
01:20:51.072 --> 01:20:53.041
each time, the thing
that I've learned


1705
01:20:53.074 --> 01:20:55.043
over the five years
of doing this,


1706
01:20:55.076 --> 01:20:56.712
is that we are all people.

1707
01:20:56.746 --> 01:20:58.447
The humanity behind it all.

1708
01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.515
The community behind it all.

1709
01:21:00.549 --> 01:21:02.384
We may look different
on the outside,


1710
01:21:02.417 --> 01:21:05.253
we may act different, we may
sound different,


1711
01:21:05.287 --> 01:21:07.255
but on the inside,
we're all the same.


1712
01:21:07.289 --> 01:21:08.223
We're all people.

1713
01:21:09.291 --> 01:21:10.525
We're all going through our
struggles together.


1714
01:21:10.559 --> 01:21:14.029
So it's about time we started
treating each other that way.


1715
01:21:14.262 --> 01:21:15.197
Building each other up.

1716
01:21:16.398 --> 01:21:17.700
Helping each other out instead
of tearing each other down


1717
01:21:17.733 --> 01:21:19.267
all the time.

1718
01:21:19.301 --> 01:21:22.037
So what I want people
to do is go out


1719
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:25.006
and be the heroes of
your own stories.


1720
01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.274
Thank you.
