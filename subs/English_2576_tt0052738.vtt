Please go in
the girls' room with Margot.
How about Anne?


153
00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:28.229
I feel fine.
I'm going to help Father.

Mr. Frank.

00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:26.621
- Mr. Frank?
- Peter?


161
00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:30.583
- Do I still have time
to get some water for my cat?
- Have you got a cat?


162
00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:33.502
Go ahead, but be quick.
You only have five minutes.

He couldn't live
without that cat.

00:19:41.762 --> 00:19:44.180
I didn't know
you had a cat.


165
00:19:44.264 --> 00:19:46.182
I love cats.

166
00:19:46.266 --> 00:19:49.018
What's its name?
Mouschi.


167
00:19:49.102 --> 00:19:52.021
What is it? Mouschi.
A him or her?


168
00:19:52.105 --> 00:19:55.024
It's a tom, and it
doesn't like strangers.


169
00:19:55.108 --> 00:19:58.110
Well, I'll have to stop
being a stranger, won't I?
Is he fixed?


170
00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:00.112
No.

171
00:20:00.197 --> 00:20:03.616
Well, you ought to
have him fixed to
keep him from fighting.


172
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.993
What a nice cat.

Where do you
go to school?

That's where
Margot and I go.

Yeah, I know.

177
00:20:16.088 --> 00:20:18.005
I've never
seen you around.


178
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.007
I used to see you
sometimes.


179
00:20:20.092 --> 00:20:22.009
You did?

180
00:20:22.094 --> 00:20:25.012
But why didn't you
ever come over?


181
00:20:25.097 --> 00:20:27.974
Oh, I don't know.
I'm sort of a lone wolf.

00:20:28.058 --> 00:20:30.267
Can't be
a lone wolf here.

Wonder what our friends
will say when
we don't show up today?

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.985
I had a date
with Sanne.

Do you know
Sanne de Vries?

No.
Sanne's
my best friend.


187
00:20:44.074 --> 00:20:46.826
She's thin like me.

188
00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:50.621
They always yell at us,
"Anne and Sanne,
the skinny bananas."


189
00:20:52.708 --> 00:20:54.917
You took off
your star.

That's right.

191
00:20:57.921 --> 00:21:01.757
You can't do that.
They'll arrest you if you
go out without your star.

- What are you going to do with it?
- Burn it.


197
00:21:14.688 --> 00:21:17.690
That's funny.
I don't think I could burn mine.


198
00:21:17.774 --> 00:21:19.692
I don't know why.

199
00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:23.279
You couldn't?
Something they make you wear
so they can kick you around?

I know.

But, after all,
it is the Star of David, isn't it?

This is fine.

they were hiding us.

[Anne Narrating]
Saturday, the first
of January, 1944.


1193
01:48:43.848 --> 01:48:49.186
Another new year has begun,
and we find ourselves
still in our hiding place.


1194
01:48:54.359 --> 01:48:59.697
We have been here now
for one year, five months
and 25 days.


1195
01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.828
One of our family
has left us.


1196
01:49:05.912 --> 01:49:10.207
Mouschi ran away.
[Coughing]


1197
01:49:10.292 --> 01:49:13.294
We're all a little thinner.

1198
01:49:13.378 --> 01:49:17.798
The Van Daans' discussions
are as violent as ever.


1199
01:49:17.882 --> 01:49:20.968
Mother still doesn't
understand me,


1200
01:49:21.052 --> 01:49:24.221
but then
I don't understand her either.


1201
01:49:27.892 --> 01:49:32.730
There is one great change, however.
A change in myself.


1202
01:49:34.566 --> 01:49:40.070
I read somewhere that girls
of my age don't feel
quite certain of themselves,


1203
01:49:40.155 --> 01:49:42.156
that they become
quiet within...


1204
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.076
and begin to think of the miracle
that is taking place in their bodies.


1205
01:49:48.371 --> 01:49:53.167
I think that
what is happening to me
is so wonderful.


1206
01:49:53.251 --> 01:49:58.756
Not only what can be seen,
but what is taking place inside.


1207
01:50:00.258 --> 01:50:05.012
Each time it has happened,
I feel I have a sweet secret,


1208
01:50:05.096 --> 01:50:10.768
and I long for the time
when I shall feel that secret
within me again.

Annele. Peter.


1210
01:52:02.881 --> 01:52:06.091
A wonderful surprise.
Mr. Kraler
and Miep are here.


1211
01:52:06.176 --> 01:52:09.011
Oh, thank you.
You shouldn't have come.


1212
01:52:09.095 --> 01:52:13.307
You should have at least
one day to yourselves.


1213
01:52:13.391 --> 01:52:16.143
Don't say that.
It's so wonderful
to see them.

What is it?
What is it?
Mr. Kraler.


1215
01:52:19.022 --> 01:52:22.816
- Happy New Year, Mr. Dussel.
- Happy New Year.


1216
01:52:22.901 --> 01:52:26.403
How are you, Margot?
Feeling any better?
I'm all right.


1217
01:52:26.488 --> 01:52:28.447
We filled her full
of every kind of pill,


1218
01:52:28.531 --> 01:52:31.909
so she won't cough
and make a noise.


1219
01:52:31.993 --> 01:52:36.163

I'll get some plates.
Thank you, Miepia.

You must have used
all of your sugar rations
for weeks.

It's beautiful,
isn't it?

It's ages since
I've even seen a cake.


1226

Not since you brought
the one last year, remember?


1227
01:52:57.769 --> 01:53:00.771
It had "Peace in 1943"
written on-


1228
01:53:04.651 --> 01:53:06.777
"Peace in 1944."

1229
01:53:08.613 --> 01:53:11.073
- Peace has to come
sometime, you know.
- Here you are.

- Peace has to come
sometime, you know.
- Here you are.


1231
01:53:14.452 --> 01:53:16.828
Now, how many of us
are there?


1232
01:53:16.955 --> 01:53:19.039
None for me,
thank you.
Oh, you must.


1233
01:53:19.123 --> 01:53:21.041
Please, Miep.

1234
01:53:21.125 --> 01:53:25.420
Good. That leaves one,
two, three- seven of us.


1235
01:53:25.505 --> 01:53:30.342
Eight. The same
as it always is.


1236
01:53:30.426 --> 01:53:33.220
I left Margot out.
I take it for granted
Margot won't eat any.


1237
01:53:33.346 --> 01:53:35.889
Why wouldn't she?
I think it
won't harm her.


1238
01:53:35.974 --> 01:53:39.977
All right, all right.
I just didn't want her to
start coughing again.

Well, Mrs. Frank
divides things better.

trying to say?
Forget it. We're wasting time.

exactly the same?

when people outside are in
such desperate need of clothing.

So if you please
to sell it for us.

a good price.

would you get me cigarettes?

we'd better all hear it.

What they'd imagine would be
worse than any reality.

His name is Karl.
You knew him.

One day he came to the office.
He closed the door
and asked me,


1300
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:57.609
"What do you hear from
your friend Mr. Frank?"


1301
01:57:57.693 --> 01:58:00.612
I told him there was a rumor
that you were in Switzerland.


1302
01:58:00.696 --> 01:58:04.783
He said he had heard
that rumor too, but he thought
I might know something more.


1303
01:58:04.867 --> 01:58:07.911
I did not pay much attention.
I- I tried to forget it.


1304
01:58:07.995 --> 01:58:10.664
And then yesterday...

1305
01:58:10.748 --> 01:58:14.292
we were coming out of
the storeroom out there.


1306
01:58:14.377 --> 01:58:17.879
I had started down
to the office.


1307
01:58:17.964 --> 01:58:19.923
I looked back.

1308
01:58:20.007 --> 01:58:22.634
He was standing,
staring at the bookcase.


1309
01:58:22.718 --> 01:58:27.597
He said, "I thought
I remember a door up here.


1310
01:58:27.682 --> 01:58:32.269
Was not there a door here
leading to the loft?"


1311
01:58:32.353 --> 01:58:35.814
Then he asked me for more money.
Twenty gilders more a week.


1312
01:58:35.898 --> 01:58:39.359
- Blackmail.
- Twenty gilders?
Very modest blackmail.


1313
01:58:39.443 --> 01:58:41.611
That's just
the beginning.

You know what I think?

1315
01:58:45.074 --> 01:58:48.535
He's the thief who was
down there that night.


1316
01:58:48.619 --> 01:58:50.704
That's how
he knows we're here.


1317
01:58:50.788 --> 01:58:53.206
How was it left?
What did you tell him?


1318
01:58:53.291 --> 01:58:55.584
I told him
I had to think about it.


1319
01:58:55.668 --> 01:58:57.669
What shall I do?
Pay him the money?


1320
01:58:57.753 --> 01:58:59.671
Take a chance
on firing him or what?


1321
01:58:59.797 --> 01:59:03.008
I do not know.
For heaven's sakes,
don't fire him.


1322
01:59:03.092 --> 01:59:06.678
Pay him what he asks.
Keep him here where you can
keep your eye on him.


1323
01:59:06.762 --> 01:59:10.015
Is it so much that he is asking?
I mean, what are
they paying nowadays?


1324
01:59:10.141 --> 01:59:12.225
He could get it
in a war plant.
Mm-hmm.

01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:17.105
But this is not a war plant.
Mind you, I do not know
if he knows or not.


1326
01:59:21.527 --> 01:59:25.071
Offer him half.
Then we'll soon know
if it is blackmail or not.


1327
01:59:25.156 --> 01:59:29.034
And if it is,
we've gotta pay, haven't we?
[Chuckles]


1328
01:59:29.118 --> 01:59:31.244
Whatever he asks,
we've gotta pay.


1329
01:59:31.329 --> 01:59:35.248
Let us decide that
when the time comes.


1330
01:59:35.333 --> 01:59:37.417
This may be all my imagination.

1331
01:59:37.501 --> 01:59:41.588
You get to a point these days
where you suspect everyone
and everything.


1332
01:59:41.672 --> 01:59:44.841
[Siren Wailing]
[Phone Rings]


1333
01:59:48.846 --> 01:59:50.847
[Wailing Continues]
[Ringing Continues]


1334
01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:01.775
What does that mean,
the telephone ringing
on a holiday?


1335
02:00:05.363 --> 02:00:09.574
That's my wife.
I told her I had to go over
some papers in my office,


1336
02:00:09.659 --> 02:00:11.785
to call me here
when she got out of church.


1337
02:00:11.869 --> 02:00:14.204
Good-bye.
Good-bye.


1338
02:00:14.288 --> 02:00:16.289
Happy New Year.

1339
02:00:16.374 --> 02:00:18.833
[All]
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Kraler.


1340
02:00:18.918 --> 02:00:20.835
[Ringing Continues]

1341
02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:23.505
I will offer him half then.

1342
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:25.590
Thank you, Mr. Kraler.

1343
02:00:30.137 --> 02:00:31.721
[Ringing Continues]
[Dussel]
You can thank your son for this.


1344
02:00:31.722 --> 02:00:33.723
[Ringing Continues]
[Dussel]
You can thank your son for this.


1345
02:00:33.808 --> 02:00:36.810
Him and his damn cat.
That night. There.


1346
02:00:39.063 --> 02:00:43.566
I tell you, it's-it's-it's-
it's just a question
of time now.


1347
02:00:49.573 --> 02:00:53.243
Sometimes I wish the end would come,
whatever it is.


1348
02:00:53.369 --> 02:00:57.247
Margot!
Well, then at least
we'd know where we were.


1349
02:00:58.541 --> 02:01:01.626
You should be ashamed of yourself,
talking that way.


1350
02:01:02.628 --> 02:01:04.587
Think how lucky we are.

1351
02:01:06.048 --> 02:01:10.677
Think of the thousands
dying in the war every day.


1352
02:01:10.761 --> 02:01:13.763
Think of the people
in concentration camps.
What's the good of that?


1353
02:01:15.433 --> 02:01:19.602
What's the good of
thinking of misery when
you're already miserable?


1354
02:01:19.687 --> 02:01:22.105
That's stupid.

1355
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:24.691
We're young,
Margot and Peter and I.


1356
02:01:24.775 --> 02:01:26.943
You grown-ups
have had your chance.


1357
02:01:29.113 --> 02:01:34.284
Look at us. If we begin
thinking of all the horror
in the world, we're lost.


1358
02:01:34.368 --> 02:01:37.203
We're trying to hold on
to some kind of ideals,


1359
02:01:37.288 --> 02:01:41.750
when everything- ideals, hope-
everything is being destroyed.


1360
02:01:43.419 --> 02:01:46.546
It isn't our fault
the world is in such a mess.


1361
02:01:46.630 --> 02:01:48.590
We weren't around
when all this started.


1362
02:01:48.674 --> 02:01:52.343
- Now you listen to me.
- So don't try to take it out on us.


1363
02:01:56.474 --> 02:01:58.433
[Huffs]

1364
02:02:01.812 --> 02:02:05.148
[Mr. Van Daan]
She talks as if
we started the war.


1365
02:02:06.192 --> 02:02:08.359
Did we start the war?

1366
02:02:17.495 --> 02:02:19.496
You left this.

1367
02:02:20.498 --> 02:02:22.499
Thanks.

1368
02:02:27.046 --> 02:02:29.255
I thought you were fine
just now.


1369
02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:32.717
You know just how to talk to 'em.
I can never think when I'm mad.


1370
02:02:33.928 --> 02:02:36.554
I say too much.

1371
02:02:36.639 --> 02:02:38.973
I hurt people's feelings.

1372
02:02:41.393 --> 02:02:43.478
I think you're just fine.

1373
02:02:54.365 --> 02:02:56.366
Thank you, Peter.

1374
02:03:02.414 --> 02:03:06.209
That Dussel,
what he said about Mouschi,
about somebody eating him,


1375
02:03:06.293 --> 02:03:08.545
all I could think is
I wanted to hit him.


1376
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:11.214
That's what I used to do
in school, but,


1377
02:03:11.298 --> 02:03:13.800
here a fight starts,
I just duck in my room.


1378
02:03:13.884 --> 02:03:17.053
You're lucky
having a room to go to.


1379
02:03:17.138 --> 02:03:20.140
His Lordship is always in mine.

1380
02:03:20.224 --> 02:03:24.310
When they start in on me,
I have to stand and take it.


1381
02:03:24.395 --> 02:03:27.313
You gave some of it
back to them just now.


1382
02:03:27.398 --> 02:03:30.358
I get so mad.

1383
02:03:30.442 --> 02:03:32.944
They've formed their opinions.

1384
02:03:33.028 --> 02:03:34.946
About everything.

1385
02:03:35.948 --> 02:03:38.366
But we're still trying to find out.

1386
02:03:40.411 --> 02:03:45.039
We have problems here that
no other people our age have ever had.


1387
02:03:46.167 --> 02:03:48.585
And just as you think
you've solved them,


1388
02:03:48.669 --> 02:03:51.212
something comes along
and, bang,


1389
02:03:53.382 --> 02:03:56.593
you have to start all over again.

1390
02:03:59.597 --> 02:04:01.598
I think your father's fine.

1391
02:04:01.682 --> 02:04:04.392
Oh, he is, Peter.
He is.


1392
02:04:04.476 --> 02:04:08.438
He's the only one
who's ever given me the feeling
that I have any sense.


1393
02:04:14.195 --> 02:04:16.279
Isn't it funny, you and I?

1394
02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:20.408
Here we've been together all this time...

1395
02:04:20.492 --> 02:04:22.994
and this is the first time
we've ever really talked.


1396
02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:29.918
It helps a lot to have someone
to talk to, doesn't it?


1397
02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.171
It helps you let off steam.

1398
02:04:34.798 --> 02:04:36.799
[Glass Clinks]

1399
02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:53.066
Any time that...

1400
02:04:53.150 --> 02:04:55.818
you want to let off steam,

1401
02:04:55.903 --> 02:04:58.071
you can come into my room.

1402
02:04:59.365 --> 02:05:02.700
I can get up
an awful lot of steam.
[Chuckles]


1403
02:05:02.785 --> 02:05:04.869
It's all right with me.

1404
02:05:06.038 --> 02:05:07.997
Do you mean that?

1405
02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:14.295
I said it, didn't I?

1406
02:05:30.354 --> 02:05:30.812
Good night.
Good night.


1407
02:05:30.813 --> 02:05:32.855
Good night.
Good night.


1408
02:05:32.982 --> 02:05:35.608
Good night.
Good night.


1409
02:05:45.869 --> 02:05:50.665
May I come in?
No, Mr. Dussel.
I'm not dressed yet.


1410
02:05:50.749 --> 02:05:52.709
Oh.

1411
02:06:17.234 --> 02:06:19.193
Margot.
Hmm?


1412
02:06:19.278 --> 02:06:22.572
Tell me, am I terribly ugly?

1413
02:06:22.698 --> 02:06:24.741
Oh, stop fishing.
No. Tell me.


1414
02:06:24.825 --> 02:06:28.870
Of course you're not.
You've got nice eyes...


1415
02:06:28.954 --> 02:06:32.790
and a lot of animation
and- and-


1416
02:06:53.562 --> 02:06:55.772
- May I come in?
- Come in, Mother.


1417
02:06:56.857 --> 02:06:59.317
Mr. Dussel is impatient
to get in here.


1418
02:06:59.401 --> 02:07:02.320
[Anne]
He takes the room
for himself the entire day.


1419
02:07:02.404 --> 02:07:05.239
You're not going in again
tonight to see Peter, hmm?


1420
02:07:06.241 --> 02:07:08.659
That is my intention.

1421
02:07:11.914 --> 02:07:14.874
Aren't you afraid
you're disturbing him?


1422
02:07:14.958 --> 02:07:17.251
Mother, I have some intuition.

1423
02:07:17.336 --> 02:07:19.504
Then may I ask you
this much, Annie?


1424
02:07:19.588 --> 02:07:22.173
Please don't shut the door
when you go in.


1425
02:07:24.885 --> 02:07:27.387
You sound like
Mrs. Van Daan.


1426
02:07:27.471 --> 02:07:30.765
Oh, no. I don't mean
to suggest anything wrong.


1427
02:07:30.849 --> 02:07:34.018
I only wish you wouldn't
expose yourself to criticism.


1428
02:07:34.103 --> 02:07:38.022
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm going to Peter's room.


1429
02:07:38.107 --> 02:07:41.901
I'm not going to let
Petronella Van Daan
spoil our friendship.


1430
02:07:47.783 --> 02:07:49.867
Just a moment, Mr. Dussel.

1431
02:07:52.746 --> 02:07:55.206
In my day the boys
called on the girls.


1432
02:07:55.290 --> 02:07:59.001
[Mrs. Frank] You know how
young people are. Peter's room
is the only place they can talk.


1433
02:07:59.086 --> 02:08:01.087
Talk?

1434
02:08:01.171 --> 02:08:03.673
That's not what they called it
when I was a girl.


1435
02:08:06.176 --> 02:08:10.179
I'm sorry, Margot,
that you have to be
the one left out.


1436
02:08:11.974 --> 02:08:14.600
I feel so guilty about you.

1437
02:08:14.685 --> 02:08:16.894
Why?

1438
02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:21.524
I mean, every time
I go to Peter-


1439
02:08:21.608 --> 02:08:25.319
into Peter's room,
I have the feeling
that I'm hurting you.


1440
02:08:26.989 --> 02:08:30.158
I know if it were me,
I'd be desperately jealous.


1441
02:08:32.995 --> 02:08:34.954
I am jealous a little.

1442
02:08:35.038 --> 02:08:37.039
Not of you and Peter.

1443
02:08:38.333 --> 02:08:40.293
I'm-

1444
02:08:40.377 --> 02:08:43.671
I'm only feeling sorry
that I haven't anyone...


1445
02:08:43.755 --> 02:08:46.632
with whom to-
to discuss my feelings.


1446
02:08:46.717 --> 02:08:48.634
Margot, I won't even-

1447
02:08:48.719 --> 02:08:52.513
Listen, you've found
a companionship,
and I want you to enjoy it.


1448
02:08:52.598 --> 02:08:57.226
Only... in my heart I feel
that I've got a right to share
feelings with someone too.


1449
02:08:59.730 --> 02:09:04.358
But I'm sure that Peter-
that that boy, he could just
never be that person for me.


1450
02:09:04.443 --> 02:09:06.360
[Knocking On Door]

1451
02:09:06.445 --> 02:09:08.988
Maybe there's nothing
to be jealous about.


1452
02:09:10.574 --> 02:09:12.950
Maybe I'm just
taking the place of his cat.


1453
02:09:13.035 --> 02:09:14.952
Will you please let me
in my room?


1454
02:09:15.037 --> 02:09:18.581
[Anne]
Just a minute,
dear, dear Mr. Dussel.


1455
02:09:29.551 --> 02:09:32.345
Well, here I go...

1456
02:09:32.429 --> 02:09:34.388
to run the gauntlet.

1457
02:09:37.351 --> 02:09:39.393
Thank you so much.

1458
02:09:47.611 --> 02:09:49.612
[Heel Snaps]

1459
02:09:51.281 --> 02:09:53.699
Look at her.

1460
02:09:53.784 --> 02:09:57.453
A lot of good it did me
to have a son.
I never see him.


1461
02:09:59.289 --> 02:10:01.290
Just a minute, dear.

1462
02:10:02.751 --> 02:10:06.462
I'd like to say
a few words to my son.
Do you mind?


1463
02:10:06.547 --> 02:10:10.132
Peter, I do not want you staying
up till all hours tonight.


1464
02:10:10.217 --> 02:10:12.260
You need your sleep.
You are a growing boy.


1465
02:10:12.344 --> 02:10:15.930
Anne won't stay late.
She's going to bed
promptly at 9:00.


1466
02:10:16.056 --> 02:10:19.892
Aren't you, Anne?
Yes, Mother. May we go now?


1467
02:10:19.977 --> 02:10:22.270
[Mrs. Frank]
Listen for the chimes, dear.


1468
02:10:42.207 --> 02:10:44.333
Aren't they impossible?

1469
02:10:46.044 --> 02:10:49.171
Treating us as if
we're still in the nursery.


1470
02:10:50.757 --> 02:10:53.759
Don't let it bother you.

I think the world may be
going through a phase,

02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:54.733
the way I was with Mother.

1921
02:45:54.818 --> 02:45:57.653
It'll pass.

02:45:57.737 --> 02:46:00.072
Maybe not
for hundreds of years,


1923
02:46:00.156 --> 02:46:02.241
but someday.

1924
02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:07.329
I still believe,

1925
02:46:07.414 --> 02:46:09.707
in spite of everything,

1926
02:46:09.791 --> 02:46:12.126
that people are
really good at heart.


1927
02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:22.010

Please, please, anyone,

if you should find this diary,

will you please
keep it safe for me,

because someday I hope that-

No more.

I had gone to the country
to try to find food.

When I got back,
the police were in the building.

We made it our business
to learn how they knew.

02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:34.197
It was the thief
who told them.

He was-

02:51:36.325 --> 02:51:38.952
It seems strange to me now,

2000
02:51:39.037 --> 02:51:43.373
but we were all so full of hope
in the camp here in Holland
where they first took us.


2001

The news of the war was good.

were sweeping through France.

We felt sure they would
get to us in time to-

But...

2005
02:51:56.512 --> 02:51:58.472
in September
we were shipped to Poland.


2006
02:51:58.556 --> 02:52:01.725
The men to one camp,
the women to another.


2007
02:52:03.478 --> 02:52:07.773
From there...
they were sent to Belsen.

to get home.


2012
02:52:23.164 --> 02:52:25.832
Each time the train
would stop, we'd...


2013
02:52:25.917 --> 02:52:28.877
all get out, you know,
at a siding or a crossing, and...

"At Mauthausen? Where?"

02:52:42.016 --> 02:52:44.434
"Is it possible that
you ever knew my wife?"

my husband, my son,

Yesterday I was in Rotterdam.

I met a woman there.

2030
02:53:24.267 --> 02:53:27.477
She'd been in Belsen...
with Anne.
