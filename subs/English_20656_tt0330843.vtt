00:01:15.813 --> 00:01:20.734
O beloved, listen to me

2
00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:25.698
Listen to me, my darling

3
00:01:26.824 --> 00:01:31.078
The moon will stealthily enter

4
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.541
Through the window in bare feet

5
00:01:35.624 --> 00:01:38.544
O beloved, listen to me

6
00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:43.090
Listen to me, my darling

7
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:48.804
The moon will stealthily enter

8
00:01:48.888 --> 00:01:53.893
Through the window in bare feet

9
00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:57.855
Listen to me

10
00:01:58.647 --> 00:02:02.359
Oh darling

11
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.912
Hey, what are you watching?
This is no movie screening.


12
00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:19.126
-Hey, you, where are you going?
-Sir, I've got to go to the station.


13
00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.712
Do I have to write it down for you?
Can't you hear?


14
00:02:22.588 --> 00:02:23.797
You can't go from here.

15
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:29.053
There has been an accident.
Take a U-turn and go back. Go.


16
00:02:55.496 --> 00:02:59.959
Will come silently through streets

17
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.259
And let off a signal

18
00:03:12.846 --> 00:03:16.850
Here from under this Neem

19
00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:27.277
And call you beside me

20
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:45.629
Today, 6:30 p.m.
Marine Lines Station


21
00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:50.926
Adi, what are you doing here?
Waiting for Suhani?


22
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:52.344
Like always.

23
00:03:52.428 --> 00:03:54.888
If you had married me, you wouldn't
have had to do all this.


24
00:03:55.222 --> 00:03:56.557
If she doesn't come in the
next ten minutes,


25
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.684
we'll elope and get married
in a nearby temple.


26
00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:00.853
-How cheap.
-Let's go.


27
00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:02.980
You, think about it.

28
00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:31.759
-Hello, Dr. Laxmi, is Suhani there?
-Hi, Adi!


29
00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:34.511
She left long ago.
Wait a minute.


30
00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:37.306
-Did she say where she was going?
-No.


31
00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:45.022
Are you sure she is not somewhere
there in the hospital?


32
00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:50.819
Okay, I'll hang up now.

33
00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:45.999
Two years earlier in Naangav

34
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.411
It overflowed the water
From the pitcher overflowed


35
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:30.043
It overflowed, for the eye
Could not hold


36
00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:37.134
It overflowed the water
From the pitcher overflowed


37
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.391
It overflowed, for the eye
Could not hold


38
00:06:46.018 --> 00:06:49.605
Mother said, don't go
Brother, I didn't listen to him


39
00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:55.444
Father said, just one day more
And it overflowed


40
00:06:56.862 --> 00:07:00.616
Gudda said don't leave
Guddi too said the same


41
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:06.496
Friend said, just one day more
And it overflowed


42
00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:13.754
The water from the pitcher overflowed

43
00:07:15.297 --> 00:07:21.261
It overflowed, for the eyes couldn't hold

44
00:07:41.114 --> 00:07:44.368
-Hey girls, where are you talking her?
-What are you doing?


45
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.455
-Listen to me! Let's go guys.
-I am there!


46
00:07:49.623 --> 00:07:51.708
He's dead.
Another one bites the dust.


47
00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:54.002
What was the need to get
life imprisonment?


48
00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:56.588
Such a happy lad. Now he's gone
and stuck his head in a noose.


49
00:07:56.838 --> 00:08:00.592
-Why? What's wrong with our girl?
-Your girl?


50
00:08:01.218 --> 00:08:03.887
So big? How old are you?

51
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:06.473
It's the magic of LUX beauty soap!
What else?


52
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:10.936
-Are you done speaking?
-Yes.


53
00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:14.439
What was it you were saying about
putting his head in a noose?


54
00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:15.774
When it comes to wearing the garland,

55
00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:17.693
why do you all stick your heads out
like tortoises?


56
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.115
It's just that this tortoise did not know
that you live in this village.


57
00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:26.159
I am very pleased to meet you.
What's your name?


58
00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:27.160
Ruin.

59
00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:29.871
-What's the matter, Adi?
-I thought marriage was ruin.


60
00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:32.165
All right, if not you,

61
00:08:32.249 --> 00:08:35.502
there are other men
who will willingly die for me.


62
00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:37.796
Hey, you.

63
00:08:38.672 --> 00:08:41.633
Here's a bitter gourd.
Eat and enjoy, you and your friends.


64
00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:43.593
Adi, what is she saying?

65
00:08:44.386 --> 00:08:46.596
Don't fall for her, Adi.
She seems bitter.


66
00:08:48.265 --> 00:08:54.229
As she walked, she said
Your house was small


67
00:09:02.321 --> 00:09:04.781
I left my songs behind
Under the wings of a bird


68
00:09:04.865 --> 00:09:07.200
By the way, who's the girl
who handed you that?


69
00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:08.660
Why? Do you also want one as well?

70
00:09:08.994 --> 00:09:12.414
No, she talks a lot.
Quite a wily girl.


71
00:09:12.497 --> 00:09:14.041
Listen, Mister, she's my daughter.

72
00:09:14.207 --> 00:09:15.208
Daughter?

73
00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:17.961
No, I meant she is very gifted.

74
00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:21.131
I messed up.
That was close!


75
00:09:21.673 --> 00:09:23.550
By the way, what is her name?

76
00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:27.346
Boy, if you weren't a guest, I would
have made meatballs out of you.


77
00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:28.513
Get lost!

78
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:34.353
And the water
From the pitcher overflowed


79
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.360
It overflowed,
For the eyes couldn't hold


80
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:46.615
Mother said don't go
Brother said I didn't listen


81
00:09:46.698 --> 00:09:52.496
Father said just one day more
And the water overflowed


82
00:09:53.872 --> 00:09:57.417
The crow said don't go
So did the saint


83
00:09:57.501 --> 00:10:03.465
The crow said, just one day more
And it overflowed


84
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.356
Hey, Ruin, I was looking for you.

85
00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:23.276
-Even my father is looking for you.
-Oh, my! I should get out of here.


86
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:30.617
You have a great smile.

87
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.621
I had heard that village girls
are very simple and innocent.


88
00:10:34.704 --> 00:10:35.539
Shy, too.

89
00:10:35.622 --> 00:10:37.457
-Aunty, come here.
-Aunty?


90
00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:39.126
She's shy and innocent, too.

91
00:10:40.627 --> 00:10:42.379
-Wow, son!
-Greetings, aunty.


92
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:49.094
Father I left your courtyard

93
00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:54.474
Your courtyard I left it behind

94
00:11:02.065 --> 00:11:07.154
Left your courtyard behind

95
00:11:08.447 --> 00:11:11.283
Left your courtyard

96
00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:18.874
When I come home next time,
Bring a diamond ring


97
00:11:25.297 --> 00:11:29.801
My friends will play with it
On their laps


98
00:11:29.885 --> 00:11:32.512
My friends will play with it
On their laps


99
00:11:32.888 --> 00:11:35.348
A bouncing bonny baby

100
00:11:36.766 --> 00:11:38.977
When the monsoons come this time

101
00:11:39.352 --> 00:11:45.317
This time, this time

102
00:11:47.694 --> 00:11:51.156
Another kind of separation
Will have its say


103
00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:53.617
Separation from my beloved

104
00:11:56.119 --> 00:12:00.790
The water from the pitcher overflowed

105
00:12:03.126 --> 00:12:08.632
It overflowed, for the eyes
Couldn't hold


106
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:16.515
The water from the pitcher overflowed

107
00:12:26.816 --> 00:12:31.238
RAILWAY COLONY, MUMBAI

108
00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:38.453
Close the book,
open your mouth and eat.


109
00:12:38.537 --> 00:12:40.705
This way, you won't eat,
nor will you study.


110
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.291
Oh, mom, if I fail, you'll haul me
over burning coals.


111
00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:45.418
No, I'll eat you raw.

112
00:12:45.669 --> 00:12:48.296
The things your father has to endure
to educate you.


113
00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.466
-Please quit fighting.
-What else should I do?


114
00:12:51.967 --> 00:12:53.385
Now, why are you not eating?

115
00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:56.805
The bread is so oily
and the yogurt is so sour.


116
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.015
Then, how come Dina ate it?

117
00:12:59.307 --> 00:13:01.893
Oh, God! Dina! Dina! Dina!

118
00:13:01.977 --> 00:13:04.354
She's your favorite.
The others are just vermin.


119
00:13:05.814 --> 00:13:07.148
Now, will you two stop it?

120
00:13:07.232 --> 00:13:08.900
Mom, she has an exam today.

121
00:13:09.985 --> 00:13:11.611
What should I do with this girl?

122
00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:14.739
Hey, where're you going?

123
00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:16.616
You carry your anger
on the tip of your nose.


124
00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:20.537
Once you become a doctor,
your patients will die without a hiccup.


125
00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:23.748
If something happens to me,
don't ever take me to her.


126
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:26.710
This girl is a real burden.

127
00:13:26.793 --> 00:13:27.877
So, why don't you give me
away to him?


128
00:13:28.044 --> 00:13:29.129
To whom?

129
00:13:29.212 --> 00:13:31.715
He who believes that a girl
is a burden.


130
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:36.052
Do your exam well.

131
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:41.975
Dad! Good I met you.
Now my paper will go off well.


132
00:13:42.225 --> 00:13:44.311
Your blessings are very important
for doing well.


133
00:13:44.394 --> 00:13:46.646
Go via the temple.
Here, keep some money.


134
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.898
Dad, she sends others
to the temple for her.


135
00:13:52.193 --> 00:13:57.115
Pinky, sweetheart, you look so pretty.
Come here.


136
00:13:57.198 --> 00:13:58.450
Your beard is poking me.

137
00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:01.286
Let it.

138
00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:04.539
Something is pricking me, too.
A lot.


139
00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:07.292
-Hi, uncle.
-Hi, Pinks.


140
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.255
Please scrub yourself with a lot of soap.

141
00:14:12.631 --> 00:14:14.633
The smoke must have clogged your pores.

142
00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:18.386
-Do you know what your son did yesterday?
-Is he not your son?


143
00:14:19.054 --> 00:14:22.682
I saw him on a motorcycle
with a long haired woman.


144
00:14:23.058 --> 00:14:24.517
They were so into each other.

145
00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:26.269
Took turns to smoke a cigarette.

146
00:14:27.062 --> 00:14:29.689
Why are you beating about the bush?
Get to the point.


147
00:14:29.773 --> 00:14:32.651
Mom, Dad saw me smoking
a cigarette yesterday.


148
00:14:33.234 --> 00:14:35.654
Cigarette!
They were smoking a cigar.


149
00:14:35.737 --> 00:14:38.073
A Peace pipe. He would take a drag
and pass it to her,


150
00:14:38.156 --> 00:14:40.158
she would take a
drag and pass it back.

151
00:14:41.242 --> 00:14:43.370
What kind of a son
have we given birth to?

152
00:14:43.453 --> 00:14:45.664
-Who was she?
-She's like a brother to me.


153
00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:48.124
That's the icing on the cake.

154
00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:50.126
Mother, she is a tomboy.

155
00:14:50.293 --> 00:14:52.962
Grandma, that must've been Meera.

156
00:14:53.046 --> 00:14:56.591
Even you scolded her
for talking like men.


157
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.928
And if I smoked one cigarette,
what great sin have I committed?


158
00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:02.013
You have done a great deed.

159
00:15:18.196 --> 00:15:22.742
It overflowed the water
From the pitcher overflowed.


160
00:15:25.578 --> 00:15:31.334
It overflowed
For the eye couldn't hold


161
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:38.800
It overflowed the water
From the pitcher overflowed.


162
00:15:41.678 --> 00:15:45.765
It overflowed
For the eye couldn't hold


163
00:15:50.353 --> 00:15:53.148
You know nothing about her

164
00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:57.277
and you want us to find one girl
amongst 12 million people.


165
00:15:57.944 --> 00:16:01.531
-What's the population of Bombay?
-Twelve million.


166
00:16:02.157 --> 00:16:04.534
-How many of them will be women?
-Fifty percent.


167
00:16:04.617 --> 00:16:06.161
Six million approximately.

168
00:16:06.703 --> 00:16:09.539
Out of these 6 million,
how many are in college?


169
00:16:09.622 --> 00:16:11.416
-Hardly 10%?
-No no, less than that.


170
00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:14.544
-Let's assume 10%. So how many is that?
-Six lakhs.


171
00:16:14.878 --> 00:16:17.172
Out of these, how many
are medical students?


172
00:16:17.255 --> 00:16:18.882
Oh, she's a doctor?

173
00:16:20.008 --> 00:16:21.342
Let's say one percent?

174
00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:22.469
How many? How many?

175
00:16:22.802 --> 00:16:26.765
-Six hundred. No, six thousand.
-You are very weak in Math.


176
00:16:27.223 --> 00:16:29.350
Out of this 6000, how many
would travel in a local train?


177
00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:30.852
Only in the city of Bombay?

178
00:16:31.186 --> 00:16:32.771
Most would travel by car.

179
00:16:32.854 --> 00:16:38.067
Leaving out buses, taxis and autos,
at least 1% will use local trains.


180
00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:40.945
-So, how many does that leave us with?
-Barely 60.


181
00:16:41.154 --> 00:16:42.947
So, out of 60 medical students,

182
00:16:43.531 --> 00:16:46.159
is it so difficult to search
for one medical student?


183
00:16:52.207 --> 00:16:53.500
Come quickly.

184
00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:56.795
Life is a pleasant journey

185
00:17:04.177 --> 00:17:06.137
She is looking at you.

186
00:17:12.936 --> 00:17:18.900
Don''t worry about what the world says!

187
00:17:19.818 --> 00:17:21.069
Don't bother. Correct.

188
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:31.287
I have a feeling
that you are in love.

189
00:17:32.288 --> 00:17:36.334
-I don't have any perverse thoughts.
-What do you mean?


190
00:17:36.876 --> 00:17:39.629
I mean, I haven't lost my mind.

191
00:17:40.129 --> 00:17:41.381
That is for the jobless.

192
00:17:44.008 --> 00:17:48.054
Mister, this is not love.
This is lust.


193
00:17:48.388 --> 00:17:51.641
It's also called desire or hunger.

194
00:17:51.891 --> 00:17:53.184
Now repeat what I said.

195
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.728
Shut up, Mr. Psychic.

196
00:17:55.979 --> 00:17:59.482
Look, son, after seeing this girl's body
once, you've lost your balance.


197
00:17:59.566 --> 00:18:01.359
After seeing her gait
you've forgotten where you are going.


198
00:18:01.442 --> 00:18:03.069
Do you call this love?

199
00:18:03.486 --> 00:18:07.073
-So what do we call it?
-As a famous poet once said:


200
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.368
What we call love is nothing
but a perversity of the mind.


201
00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:14.497
What do you mean perversity?

202
00:18:15.248 --> 00:18:17.041
In medical terms,

203
00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:19.544
It means that your hormones
are working overtime.


204
00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:24.883
In Hindi, that means keep your nonsense
to yourself.


205
00:18:28.428 --> 00:18:30.597
-Your face is saying it all.
-What?


206
00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:32.807
That I've lost my mind?

207
00:18:34.142 --> 00:18:36.519
-It looks like there is a fire in you.
-Shut up.


208
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:44.068
Let me sleep!

209
00:18:58.875 --> 00:19:01.544
He's not here. 
Get off the train.

210
00:19:01.794 --> 00:19:04.881
Why don't you look on top?
Maybe he's dancing on the roof.


211
00:19:04.964 --> 00:19:05.965
Very funny!

212
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:08.718
By the time you see him,
the train would have started.


213
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:10.803
Look there. Over there, your lover boy.

214
00:19:19.896 --> 00:19:21.356
Aren't you going to get off?

215
00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:12.073
-Who are you looking for?
-Nobody.


216
00:20:13.241 --> 00:20:16.953
That girl there? The one who is
removing clothes from the line?


217
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:19.998
Do you know her name?

218
00:20:21.791 --> 00:20:24.168
Do you know how to whistle?
Like this?


219
00:20:27.046 --> 00:20:29.382
You look like a decent man.
Make some noise.


220
00:20:29.465 --> 00:20:31.259
-What?
-Accelerate your bike.


221
00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:39.350
See. It worked, didn't it?

222
00:20:39.934 --> 00:20:41.227
What are you doing there?

223
00:20:41.686 --> 00:20:44.313
Coming, I was just showing him the way.

224
00:20:44.397 --> 00:20:45.523
Poor thing, he's lost.

225
00:20:45.773 --> 00:20:47.358
Dina, are you coming up or not?

226
00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:05.043
-Where?
-Who?


227
00:21:05.334 --> 00:21:06.502
Why are you singing this song now?

228
00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:09.922
Life is a pleasant journey

229
00:21:12.133 --> 00:21:14.802
Miss Suhani, I miss you very much.

230
00:21:15.344 --> 00:21:18.389
Morning, noon and night
your face haunts me.


231
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.768
Either stop haunting me or tell me
what we both should do.


232
00:21:24.103 --> 00:21:28.441
-Miss Suhani, Miss Suhani
-Shut up!


233
00:21:30.109 --> 00:21:31.110
He's mad.

234
00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:55.968
-He's found his way here, too.
-He's the same chap, isn't he?


235
00:21:56.052 --> 00:21:58.471
The madman has come here also.
I'll be back.


236
00:21:58.554 --> 00:21:59.764
Yes, I'll give her moral support.

237
00:21:59.847 --> 00:22:01.265
-Where are you going?
-Body guard.


238
00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:02.975
No, you come here. Come with me.

239
00:22:06.687 --> 00:22:07.772
What's your name?

240
00:22:13.194 --> 00:22:14.278
Aditya.

241
00:22:14.487 --> 00:22:16.739
So, you run behind girls
instead of studying?


242
00:22:17.115 --> 00:22:19.200
Looks like your father has
a lot of money for you to waste.


243
00:22:19.534 --> 00:22:21.202
Yeah. He says the same thing.

244
00:22:21.828 --> 00:22:24.038
How many times have you failed
in your class?


245
00:22:24.664 --> 00:22:25.706
I haven't so far.

246
00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:29.418
This time I might.

247
00:22:33.172 --> 00:22:34.507
Smile again.

248
00:22:35.675 --> 00:22:36.509
Please?

249
00:22:37.593 --> 00:22:42.056
Dear friend

250
00:22:43.558 --> 00:22:47.019
Your soft, lilting laughter

251
00:22:48.229 --> 00:22:50.690
Dear friend

252
00:22:51.232 --> 00:22:53.359
Dear friend

253
00:22:54.569 --> 00:22:57.989
I heard it and drank it all up

254
00:23:21.888 --> 00:23:26.893
May you always laugh like this
And blush shyly


255
00:23:27.435 --> 00:23:32.523
And light and darkness meet
On the nape of your neck, under your curls


256
00:23:32.773 --> 00:23:38.029
May your fragrant laughter grow
And envelop me


257
00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:05.389
Don't go in the garden dressed
In yellow sunshine


258
00:24:05.598 --> 00:24:08.309
The bees will tease you

259
00:24:08.392 --> 00:24:13.272
So don't go among the flowers

260
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.114
Laugh softly again

261
00:24:22.198 --> 00:24:27.078
Your beautiful laughter

262
00:24:27.495 --> 00:24:32.208
Lying on the lawn
Like freshly fallen leaves


263
00:24:32.917 --> 00:24:38.005
There are seven hues
In one sensuous move of Spring


264
00:24:38.381 --> 00:24:42.802
The rainy season it's all you

265
00:24:43.719 --> 00:24:48.891
Laugh season to season

266
00:24:49.225 --> 00:24:53.020
That soft laughter of yours

267
00:24:53.688 --> 00:24:55.731
Dear friend

268
00:24:56.816 --> 00:24:58.693
Dear friend

269
00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:03.364
Your soft lilting laugh

270
00:25:04.865 --> 00:25:06.784
Dear friend

271
00:25:07.618 --> 00:25:09.745
Dear friend

272
00:25:11.163 --> 00:25:14.458
I heard it, and drank it all up

273
00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:20.673
Come, let's roam around

274
00:25:22.008 --> 00:25:26.595
In the blue skies sometime

275
00:25:27.555 --> 00:25:32.018
If we find a
speck of cloud by chance

276
00:25:32.852 --> 00:25:37.690
Let's shower it on earth

277
00:25:38.482 --> 00:25:43.738
Your ear-ring is quivering

278
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:49.201
Somewhere morning has broken

279
00:25:49.368 --> 00:25:54.707
Somewhere evening has fallen

280
00:26:16.687 --> 00:26:21.359
In the shelter of your hair

281
00:26:22.026 --> 00:26:26.530
We will spend the night

282
00:26:27.615 --> 00:26:32.370
Your jet-black eyes

283
00:26:32.912 --> 00:26:37.333
Hold a glint in them

284
00:26:38.501 --> 00:26:43.714
In exchange for a smile from you

285
00:26:44.173 --> 00:26:48.719
Take this earth of mine

286
00:26:49.678 --> 00:26:54.141
And this sky too

287
00:26:54.225 --> 00:26:56.227
Dear friend

288
00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:58.813
Dear friend

289
00:27:00.231 --> 00:27:03.442
Your soft, lilting laughter

290
00:27:04.985 --> 00:27:06.654
Dear friend

291
00:27:07.613 --> 00:27:10.032
Dear friend

292
00:27:11.117 --> 00:27:14.495
I heard it, and drank it all up

293
00:27:16.747 --> 00:27:19.417
Snow has fallen in the valley

294
00:27:22.086 --> 00:27:25.089
Cuddled in white woolen

295
00:27:27.508 --> 00:27:33.055
Snow has fallen in the valley
And your laughter hummed through it


296
00:27:33.139 --> 00:27:35.641
Cuddled in wool

297
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.519
Talk and words come out as vapor

298
00:27:38.602 --> 00:27:43.816
Hot, steaming vapor
Yet soft and gentle


299
00:27:57.913 --> 00:28:00.499
Hello! Jeevan stores.

300
00:28:02.877 --> 00:28:03.919
Who's speaking?

301
00:28:04.003 --> 00:28:06.172
Tell him to call Suhani from 105.

302
00:28:06.255 --> 00:28:08.382
Call Suhani from No. 105.

303
00:28:09.133 --> 00:28:11.135
-Who are you?
-I am Pinky.


304
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.221
-Pinky?
-He says "Pinky, who?"


305
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.265
Tell him you're her friend's sister.

306
00:28:16.348 --> 00:28:18.100
Tell him you're her friends sister.

307
00:28:19.268 --> 00:28:20.853
What work do you have with her?

308
00:28:20.936 --> 00:28:22.313
Uncle wants to talk to her.

309
00:28:22.605 --> 00:28:26.734
-Brat, say what I say.
-Brat, say what I say.


310
00:28:29.111 --> 00:28:30.946
You shouldn't talk like that.

311
00:28:32.156 --> 00:28:34.783
Say, go and tell Suhani
that there is a call for her.


312
00:28:34.867 --> 00:28:36.660
Why are you abusing the kid?

313
00:28:36.869 --> 00:28:39.121
I am not abusing him, madam.
He is my nephew.


314
00:28:39.205 --> 00:28:40.247
Give me the phone.

315
00:28:40.331 --> 00:28:42.625
Uncle, my ten rupees.
You promised me.


316
00:28:43.167 --> 00:28:45.544
Here. Now, run away.

317
00:28:45.836 --> 00:28:49.465
-Hi, Jeevan Uncle, whose phone is it?
-It's some friend's uncle.


318
00:28:50.466 --> 00:28:52.343
-Hello?
-Suhani?


319
00:28:52.551 --> 00:28:54.428
You? How did you get this number?

320
00:28:55.429 --> 00:28:58.182
-Listen, I have something to tell you.
-What?


321
00:28:58.265 --> 00:28:59.642
There is a small get together
at my house tomorrow.


322
00:28:59.725 --> 00:29:01.602
Get here at 9 a.m. Okay?

323
00:29:01.685 --> 00:29:03.187
Me? Why me?

324
00:29:03.479 --> 00:29:07.858
-Why? Because you sing very well.
-So what?


325
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.112
Look, I'm not asking you to go
on a trip with me, right?


326
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:15.491
I'm only asking you to come
for our family function.


327
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.826
But, why should I come to your house?

328
00:29:19.703 --> 00:29:21.914
Because if you don't come to my house,

329
00:29:22.581 --> 00:29:24.416
I will bring everyone to your house.

330
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.669
You're mad. You are a total freak.

331
00:29:27.294 --> 00:29:28.587
I am mad for you.

332
00:29:29.505 --> 00:29:31.507
Note down the asylum's address,
will you?


333
00:29:31.715 --> 00:29:34.718
-63, Silverine.
-Listen.


334
00:29:34.885 --> 00:29:35.844
At least listen to me.

335
00:29:35.928 --> 00:29:38.514
Okay, take a U-turn
from Worli Dairy.


336
00:29:38.597 --> 00:29:40.933
-Once you do that, there's a small garden.
-Listen to me!


337
00:29:41.058 --> 00:29:43.394
-Bungalow opposite the garden is mine.
-Adi!


338
00:29:45.062 --> 00:29:45.896
Adi!

339
00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:53.571
Adi!

340
00:29:56.073 --> 00:29:58.576
Adi? Who's this Adi in our house?

341
00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:00.202
Adi!

342
00:30:07.209 --> 00:30:10.671
Looking into my eyes
Meeting my gaze


343
00:30:10.754 --> 00:30:13.716
Looking into my eyes
Meeting my gaze


344
00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:19.054
Looking into my eyes, betrayal and
Deceit he gave me


345
00:30:20.431 --> 00:30:23.851
Looking into my eyes, betrayal and
Deceit he gave me


346
00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:27.187
He held me captive
In his eyes


347
00:30:27.271 --> 00:30:30.649
He held me captive
In his eyes


348
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:42.995
I lost all sense of myself.
I was in a trance


349
00:30:48.334 --> 00:30:52.338
I lost all sense of myself
I was in a trance


350
00:31:05.643 --> 00:31:11.607
He sure had cast a spell on me

351
00:31:12.107 --> 00:31:18.072
With a mere touch

352
00:31:19.031 --> 00:31:24.995
Deceit and betrayal is what I saw him
Overflowing with


353
00:31:25.663 --> 00:31:30.250
When he looked into my eyes

354
00:31:30.334 --> 00:31:35.798
When he looked into my eyes

355
00:31:36.006 --> 00:31:41.970
He held me captive in his eyes

356
00:31:45.432 --> 00:31:46.684
Who are those girls?

357
00:31:46.767 --> 00:31:48.477
She's the one I am going to marry.

358
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:49.728
Which one?

359
00:31:49.812 --> 00:31:51.188
That one in the cream sari.

360
00:31:53.732 --> 00:31:56.819
Adi, are you really going to
marry that girl?


361
00:31:56.902 --> 00:31:59.363
Absolutely, aunty.
So far we haven't fixed a date,


362
00:31:59.446 --> 00:32:02.032
but, once it's fixed,
you will be the first to know.


363
00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:05.411
Adi's marriage has been finalized.

364
00:32:06.578 --> 00:32:09.206
Adi's engagement has been fixed.
She's Adi's fiancĂ©e.


365
00:32:10.082 --> 00:32:13.419
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations to you, too.


366
00:32:13.502 --> 00:32:16.505
You didn't tell us Aditya's marriage
has been fixed.


367
00:32:17.297 --> 00:32:20.300
-Wait, what?
-Adi's Marriage.


368
00:32:20.384 --> 00:32:23.303
-Really? With whom?
-With that girl.


369
00:32:24.805 --> 00:32:26.140
The one in the cream sari.

370
00:32:27.307 --> 00:32:29.476
Congratulations to you also.

371
00:32:30.102 --> 00:32:31.937
She won't ask for any dowry, I hope.

372
00:32:32.354 --> 00:32:33.605
You are very amusing.

373
00:32:35.232 --> 00:32:36.275
Yes.

374
00:32:36.358 --> 00:32:37.234
Who's that?

375
00:32:39.862 --> 00:32:41.488
-I don't know.
-What do you mean?


376
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.741
Why did you tell everyone
that I'm going to marry you?


377
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:46.577
When did I say
that you are marrying me?

378
00:32:47.161 --> 00:32:49.496
I only said that I am marrying you.

379
00:32:50.622 --> 00:32:53.041
Stop giggling now.

380
00:32:54.585 --> 00:32:55.753
Did you ask me?

381
00:32:56.211 --> 00:32:58.630
How can I? This is something
the elders should take care of.


382
00:32:59.089 --> 00:33:01.091
But if you insist, I'll ask you.

383
00:33:01.592 --> 00:33:02.718
-Will you mar...
-No.


384
00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:03.844
Very good.

385
00:33:03.927 --> 00:33:07.347
I'll ask mom and dad to come over.
Let them fix the date.


386
00:33:08.015 --> 00:33:10.100
-Why would I marry you?
-No, no, no!


387
00:33:10.309 --> 00:33:12.478
Ask me why I'm marrying you.

388
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:13.562
Why?

389
00:33:17.274 --> 00:33:18.317
Because...

390
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.443
What?

391
00:33:21.612 --> 00:33:22.738
You want me to say it?

392
00:33:29.787 --> 00:33:30.996
Because I love you.

393
00:33:33.457 --> 00:33:34.458
What is that?

394
00:33:35.793 --> 00:33:36.960
-What?
-Yeah.


395
00:33:39.254 --> 00:33:43.008
-I love you means I love you.
-Means what?


396
00:33:43.926 --> 00:33:45.052
-What do you mean
-What do you mean?


397
00:33:45.135 --> 00:33:47.262
I love you means
I can do anything for you.


398
00:33:48.639 --> 00:33:50.307
Can you jump off the train?

399
00:33:50.891 --> 00:33:52.559
Yeah, once it stops I'll jump.

400
00:33:53.852 --> 00:33:55.854
As soon as you jump off,
I'll marry you.


401
00:34:07.991 --> 00:34:10.118
It's simple and straight forward.
Do you like him or not?


402
00:34:10.327 --> 00:34:13.330
My final exams are approaching,
and then I have to intern.


403
00:34:13.413 --> 00:34:16.542
I have to prepare for my M.D.
I don't know.


404
00:34:16.708 --> 00:34:20.379
-No, tell me. Do you like him or not?
-How can I?


405
00:34:20.796 --> 00:34:24.132
Think about it.
You have to get married first.


406
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:26.426
-Do you like him or not?
-No!


407
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.970
-Yes or no?
-No!


408
00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:32.558
Okay, then, you've cleared the way for me.
Don't tell me I didn't ask.


409
00:34:32.766 --> 00:34:33.809
What do you mean?

410
00:34:33.892 --> 00:34:35.978
Meaning, you don't like him,
but I do.


411
00:34:36.061 --> 00:34:38.981
-What do you mean?
-I like him a lot.


412
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:40.357
Come on!

413
00:34:40.858 --> 00:34:43.777
So, you want to have your cake
and eat it, too?


414
00:34:44.111 --> 00:34:44.945
Shut up!

415
00:34:48.657 --> 00:34:53.787
Dad, if there is a proposal
from a rich family, what would you do?


416
00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:56.832
-What?
-What are you blabbering?


417
00:34:57.416 --> 00:35:00.377
Just hypothetically speaking.
What if there is a proposal?


418
00:35:01.044 --> 00:35:04.298
-What kind of a proposal?
-Obviously a marriage proposal.


419
00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.009
Nobody will come asking you
to be his sister


420
00:35:07.259 --> 00:35:09.386
If she's saying something, let her.

421
00:35:09.553 --> 00:35:11.930
Sister, stop throwing the trump card.

422
00:35:12.598 --> 00:35:14.641
I got a jack, so
I am throwing a jack.

423
00:35:17.853 --> 00:35:19.229
Excuse me. I have to study.

424
00:35:21.815 --> 00:35:23.650
-It's your turn.
-All right.


425
00:35:23.734 --> 00:35:27.571
Dad, someone is coming tomorrow
with a marriage proposal.


426
00:35:28.322 --> 00:35:31.617
-Not for me, for Suhani.
-All right, but who are they?


427
00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:35.579
This barrister for his son, Aditya.

428
00:35:37.998 --> 00:35:41.585
No one has sent word.
Will they land up just like that?


429
00:35:42.544 --> 00:35:44.796
I am informing you, aren't I?

430
00:35:45.672 --> 00:35:48.926
Is this why we're pawning jewelery
to educate you?


431
00:35:49.426 --> 00:35:51.303
Is this why we sent you to college?

432
00:35:51.887 --> 00:35:53.430
Mom, I haven't done anything.

433
00:35:53.513 --> 00:35:55.891
Neither am I getting married,
not have I invited anyone.


434
00:35:56.058 --> 00:35:58.101
If someone is piling on,
what can I do?


435
00:35:59.061 --> 00:36:00.520
You must have done something.

436
00:36:00.604 --> 00:36:02.481
Nobody wants to pile on
for no reason.


437
00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.346
Please, come in.

438
00:36:34.429 --> 00:36:37.057
Barrister Om Sehgal.
Your doorbell is probably not working.


439
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.558
That's why I had to knock.

440
00:36:39.101 --> 00:36:41.645
I did call the electrician,
but he hasn't shown up.


441
00:36:45.649 --> 00:36:47.317
-Greetings.
-Greetings.


442
00:36:47.401 --> 00:36:49.528
-Chandraprakash Sharma.
-Barrister Om.


443
00:36:50.028 --> 00:36:51.196
Please, come this way.

444
00:36:53.991 --> 00:36:55.367
I hope you didn't have a problem
finding the house?


445
00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.954
It was a bit of problem. All these houses
look like train compartments.


446
00:36:59.246 --> 00:37:00.831
After all, it's Railway Colony.

447
00:37:01.999 --> 00:37:03.875
He always keeps joking.

448
00:37:04.334 --> 00:37:06.253
This is how middle class homes are.

449
00:37:06.503 --> 00:37:10.257
I guess you've never been in one.
Come, Suhaani.


450
00:37:12.634 --> 00:37:17.264
Sir, these are my daughters,
Dina and Suhani. Come, sit.


451
00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:23.562
Both of them sing very beautifully.
I've heard them when they came home.


452
00:37:24.187 --> 00:37:25.230
Really?

453
00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:30.444
These kids have been brewing
their own broth quietly.


454
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:33.613
Times and customs are changing.

455
00:37:34.489 --> 00:37:37.242
Parents are only needed
to make their wishes comes true.


456
00:37:37.492 --> 00:37:39.244
They don't even listen to us.

457
00:37:39.995 --> 00:37:42.581
Now, I told Aditya that I agree
that it's my money,


458
00:37:42.914 --> 00:37:47.044
but the lungs are yours.
Still won't quit smoking.


459
00:37:49.337 --> 00:37:52.257
By the way, which one of them
does Aditya like?


460
00:37:52.549 --> 00:37:54.259
He is so forgetful.

461
00:37:54.426 --> 00:37:56.428
If I stay at my mothers
for a long time,


462
00:37:56.511 --> 00:37:59.014
he asks me who I am
and what I want


463
00:37:59.097 --> 00:38:00.307
when I'm at the door.

464
00:38:01.266 --> 00:38:02.976
He is quite the entertainer.

465
00:38:03.727 --> 00:38:06.021
He must be keeping everyone
at home in splits.


466
00:38:07.814 --> 00:38:09.941
Why don't you bring us some tea?

467
00:38:11.318 --> 00:38:12.694
Suhani is the younger one.

468
00:38:12.903 --> 00:38:14.863
She and Adi are in love
with each other.


469
00:38:15.322 --> 00:38:18.366
-And the elder one?
-Dina is the elder one.


470
00:38:18.992 --> 00:38:21.036
-She isn't married yet.
-Why?


471
00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:23.622
Is she waiting for someone
who won't ask for dowry?


472
00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:26.166
You are quite rude.

473
00:38:27.501 --> 00:38:29.211
What do you think of my daughters?

474
00:38:29.753 --> 00:38:33.048
We might be poor, but we've brought
them up like princesses.


475
00:38:33.548 --> 00:38:38.178
Please don't misunderstand me.
I was saying it's a good thing


476
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.639
that the girl's parents don't have to
worry about dowry now.


477
00:38:41.056 --> 00:38:44.392
Anyway, we don't expect anything
from you.


478
00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:46.770
No, if you have any expectations,
do tell us.


479
00:38:46.853 --> 00:38:49.189
What expectations can we have from you?
We don't have any from our own son.


480
00:38:49.272 --> 00:38:50.732
We've given him good education,
that's enough.


481
00:38:50.982 --> 00:38:52.150
He's an adult now.

482
00:38:52.234 --> 00:38:53.902
If he picks someone from the streets
and asks to marry her,


483
00:38:53.985 --> 00:38:54.945
we cannot do anything about it.

484
00:38:55.028 --> 00:38:55.946
Hold on a second.

485
00:38:56.488 --> 00:38:59.908
Do you think we're auctioning
our daughters


486
00:38:59.991 --> 00:39:01.493
for the first available groom?

487
00:39:01.952 --> 00:39:04.704
-Dad, what are you saying?
-You keep quiet.


488
00:39:04.788 --> 00:39:07.040
Mr. Advocate, here, is
highly qualified,


489
00:39:07.124 --> 00:39:09.000
but he does not have any manners?

490
00:39:09.084 --> 00:39:11.419
You aren't understanding.

491
00:39:11.503 --> 00:39:15.048
-I did not mean that at all.
-There is nothing left to be said.


492
00:39:16.007 --> 00:39:18.343
Suhaani will not marry Adi.
No matter what.


493
00:39:18.844 --> 00:39:21.346
You think this is happening
because we want it to?


494
00:39:21.972 --> 00:39:25.600
Let it be. This is not the time
for sweets. Let's go.


495
00:39:26.393 --> 00:39:28.270
I'm glad we're under no obligations.

496
00:39:41.283 --> 00:39:44.619
Suhaani, listen! 
What happened?

497
00:39:45.662 --> 00:39:50.625
Whatever had to happen has happened.
Let's finish this right here.


498
00:39:50.959 --> 00:39:52.878
Our parents met, right?
What happened?


499
00:39:53.003 --> 00:39:56.173
Yes, they met.
Like Musharraf met Vajpayee.


500
00:39:56.423 --> 00:39:58.300
It was like reliving the Agra summit.

501
00:39:58.425 --> 00:40:02.262
Look, it's not like
they are getting married.


502
00:40:02.345 --> 00:40:04.181
We have to marry.
It's for us to decide.


503
00:40:04.264 --> 00:40:05.432
What will we decide?

504
00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:09.436
By seeking their permission,
we showed them our respect.


505
00:40:09.519 --> 00:40:11.855
The respect we got from your father
is more than enough.


506
00:40:11.938 --> 00:40:13.064
We don't want anymore.

507
00:40:13.148 --> 00:40:14.858
So, my love means nothing?

508
00:40:15.192 --> 00:40:17.611
How long have you known me?
Twenty weeks?


509
00:40:18.153 --> 00:40:20.030
They have brought me up for 20 years.

510
00:40:20.447 --> 00:40:21.990
I cannot leave them for you.

511
00:40:23.074 --> 00:40:26.036
Suhani, I can leave everything for you.
Everything.


512
00:40:27.329 --> 00:40:29.289
Today, you can leave everything for me.

513
00:40:29.372 --> 00:40:33.084
What is the guarantee that tomorrow
you will not leave me for another girl?


514
00:40:33.168 --> 00:40:34.878
What is this sick logic?

515
00:40:35.128 --> 00:40:36.713
So, I have to be the scapegoat?

516
00:40:36.796 --> 00:40:38.465
Why are you making a mountain
out of a molehill?


517
00:40:39.007 --> 00:40:41.301
You saw me, chased me,
professed your love.


518
00:40:41.384 --> 00:40:44.346
That's all. What if I had said no
in the beginning?


519
00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:46.264
I would have thought of it
as your bad luck.


520
00:40:46.348 --> 00:40:47.307
So, do that now.

521
00:40:50.685 --> 00:40:52.270
You are right, 
I'm sorry, okay?

522
00:40:52.354 --> 00:40:55.065
At least listen to me, Suhani.
Please. Just one minute.


523
00:40:55.315 --> 00:41:00.779
What's the hurry?
Let's give it some time.


524
00:41:00.862 --> 00:41:03.907
Ten days? A week?
Till the 15th?


525
00:41:04.366 --> 00:41:05.742
Think about it. 
If you still feel...

526
00:41:05.825 --> 00:41:08.370
What is going to change in one week?
Just leave it.


527
00:41:10.914 --> 00:41:12.832
Suhani, Listen to me.
Lots can happen in a week.


528
00:41:12.916 --> 00:41:15.085
Give it some time.

529
00:41:15.168 --> 00:41:16.253
Please, Suhaani!

530
00:41:16.336 --> 00:41:18.588
Maybe I'll fall in love with someone else?

531
00:41:19.798 --> 00:41:21.967
You love me, don't you?

532
00:41:29.641 --> 00:41:34.562
Today, 9:50 p.m.
MARINE LINES STATION


533
00:41:47.075 --> 00:41:51.246
-Hello, Dr. Bala!
-Aditya, how are you?


534
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:52.330
I'm fine, sir.

535
00:41:52.414 --> 00:41:56.418
How is Dr. Suhani?
We never get time to talk to her.


536
00:41:56.835 --> 00:42:00.171
She leaves the hospital by 5:30.

537
00:42:00.422 --> 00:42:02.299
-Is it? I know.

538
00:42:02.674 --> 00:42:05.260
I had asked her to meet me today
before leaving.


539
00:42:05.593 --> 00:42:08.680
I got held up and later she was nowhere
to be seen.


540
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:10.598
Sir, I'll talk to you later.

541
00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:12.934
-What happened?
-He doesn't know.


542
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.522
She left the hospital at 5.30.

543
00:42:19.065 --> 00:42:22.360
Call Rajeev. She must have gone there.
She's just had a baby.


544
00:42:23.862 --> 00:42:26.740
Hello Rajeev!

545
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:28.992
Adi, where have you guys been?

546
00:42:29.242 --> 00:42:32.287
You don't call, you don't visit.
Didn't even come to meet the baby.


547
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:33.580
When are you coming?

548
00:42:33.747 --> 00:42:34.956
In a day or two.

549
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.792
The others haven't called either.
Where have they been?


550
00:42:37.876 --> 00:42:38.710
Okay, bye.

551
00:42:56.728 --> 00:42:59.356
Aditya, this relationship will not work.

552
00:43:00.065 --> 00:43:02.067
Lives don't change in eight or ten days.

553
00:43:02.984 --> 00:43:05.820
I've heard they can change in a second.

554
00:43:06.654 --> 00:43:07.739
Mine didn't.

555
00:43:10.867 --> 00:43:12.369
Did you not miss me?

556
00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:15.955
No, there was no reason to.

557
00:43:17.457 --> 00:43:21.586
There is so much to do.
Chores, studies.


558
00:43:25.715 --> 00:43:28.968
-You want to give it a thought later?
-I already have.


559
00:43:37.185 --> 00:43:40.647
-Ok. Bye!
-Good bye!


560
00:43:41.272 --> 00:43:42.482
Be like this always.

561
00:43:44.317 --> 00:43:45.443
How? Sad?

562
00:43:45.944 --> 00:43:47.028
Smiling.

563
00:44:16.474 --> 00:44:19.310
How long will you evade it?

564
00:44:22.439 --> 00:44:25.150
I mean, how long will you avoid
taking the train?


565
00:44:25.233 --> 00:44:28.069
Even if I forget, you won't let me.

566
00:44:50.216 --> 00:44:54.762
Be careful. It's a computer,
not an old typewriter.


567
00:44:55.013 --> 00:44:58.391
-Like, Billu, even we'll be great.
-Who's Billu?


568
00:44:58.725 --> 00:45:01.060
Good old Bill Gates, who else?

569
00:45:01.519 --> 00:45:06.566
Ok, guys! The first computer!

570
00:45:10.403 --> 00:45:12.614
Hello!

571
00:45:13.072 --> 00:45:15.116
Hi, Jeevan uncle!

572
00:45:15.325 --> 00:45:17.702
You should come sooner
to attend calls at night.


573
00:45:19.037 --> 00:45:20.747
Uncle, it's for you.

574
00:45:24.417 --> 00:45:25.793
What are you doing?

575
00:45:42.644 --> 00:45:45.104
What's the matter?
Has it got disconnected?


576
00:45:50.401 --> 00:45:52.946
Then, why don't you talk?
I am not listening.


577
00:46:15.009 --> 00:46:18.805
-Who are you looking for?
-Do you know where Suhani is?


578
00:46:19.264 --> 00:46:21.683
Didn't you guys break up?

579
00:46:23.017 --> 00:46:25.478
Yes, but do you know where she is?

580
00:46:25.603 --> 00:46:28.690
-I've been looking for her for a few days.
-She's gone.


581
00:46:29.357 --> 00:46:30.817
-Gone?
-She's gone to the US.


582
00:46:32.527 --> 00:46:36.239
-US?
-I'm kidding. Medical Camp in Karwar.


583
00:46:41.494 --> 00:46:43.329
-When is she back?
-In three weeks.


584
00:46:43.413 --> 00:46:44.622
Three weeks?

585
00:46:44.956 --> 00:46:46.457
Too long, isn't it?

586
00:47:10.481 --> 00:47:12.358
What do you need this much money for?

587
00:47:12.525 --> 00:47:13.776
I am going out.

588
00:47:14.027 --> 00:47:16.070
Where? Outside Bombay?

589
00:47:17.989 --> 00:47:19.157
Yes, I'll be back soon.

590
00:47:20.158 --> 00:47:21.659
What if your father finds out?

591
00:47:21.909 --> 00:47:23.202
You take care of it.

592
00:47:25.204 --> 00:47:26.539
Are you going with Suhani?

593
00:47:28.833 --> 00:47:29.876
To find her.

594
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.008
The sky was barren

595
00:47:38.468 --> 00:47:41.346
Everything is barren

596
00:47:41.429 --> 00:47:44.390
When I went in search of you,
My dear beloved


597
00:47:44.474 --> 00:47:47.435
I walked many miserable miles

598
00:47:47.518 --> 00:47:53.483
It's all such a waste
It's all a wasteland, so futile


599
00:48:05.036 --> 00:48:08.164
Let me meet my darling

600
00:48:08.247 --> 00:48:11.376
Let me meet, just once

601
00:48:12.001 --> 00:48:16.172
Let me meet, just once

602
00:48:17.965 --> 00:48:22.887
Let me meet, just once

603
00:48:25.932 --> 00:48:28.768
O my dearest one
I scanned the skies minutely


604
00:48:28.851 --> 00:48:33.815
And plucked the broken stars

605
00:48:34.857 --> 00:48:40.780
This starlight till the dawn
My eyes get no sleep


606
00:48:40.988 --> 00:48:46.953
Dear God! Oh dear god!

607
00:48:57.839 --> 00:49:01.509
O my dearest one
I scanned the skies minutely


608
00:49:01.676 --> 00:49:04.512
And plucked the broken stars

609
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:10.268
Just to hear your footfall

610
00:49:10.351 --> 00:49:15.648
I have even borne the silence of
The stones and the statues


611
00:49:16.149 --> 00:49:21.696
I now find only dejection

612
00:50:14.207 --> 00:50:17.084
Everything is barren

613
00:50:38.147 --> 00:50:41.192
When I went in search of you,
My dear beloved


614
00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:44.946
I walked many miserable miles

615
00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:56.040
Look at the fate that is
Etched on my brow


616
00:51:00.127 --> 00:51:05.007
Whenever I saw footprints
I've bowed my head there


617
00:51:17.728 --> 00:51:20.898
How many times must
I call out to you?


618
00:51:20.982 --> 00:51:26.195
Your name is what
I find everywhere


619
00:51:55.391 --> 00:51:57.059
Why did you take so long to come?

620
00:51:57.602 --> 00:52:01.063
I can't live without you.
Not for a day.


621
00:52:01.355 --> 00:52:02.356
Not even a moment.

622
00:52:03.316 --> 00:52:04.191
I love you.

623
00:52:08.988 --> 00:52:10.406
Will you do anything for me?

624
00:52:11.949 --> 00:52:13.618
Should I jump off a moving train?

625
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:17.914
Marry me.

626
00:52:23.377 --> 00:52:25.796
We'll marry and stay in our own homes.

627
00:52:26.005 --> 00:52:27.506
We won't tell anyone.

628
00:52:28.925 --> 00:52:30.176
-Not a soul?
-No.


629
00:52:30.509 --> 00:52:32.428
When the time is right, we'll confess.

630
00:52:50.237 --> 00:52:52.073
What happened?
What are you thinking?


631
00:52:52.865 --> 00:52:54.158
I am very scared.

632
00:52:54.241 --> 00:52:56.827
Doesn't matter, get married anyway.

633
00:52:57.078 --> 00:52:58.537
Don't be silly.

634
00:52:58.621 --> 00:52:59.956
I am really scared.

635
00:53:00.039 --> 00:53:02.708
I'll give you one slap
and it will be all right.


636
00:53:03.209 --> 00:53:06.128
Every time I told you
to think ten times before proceeding,


637
00:53:06.379 --> 00:53:08.255
you asked me to shut up.

638
00:53:10.925 --> 00:53:12.134
I'm in a dilemma.

639
00:53:15.888 --> 00:53:18.557
I've thought about this
very seriously.


640
00:53:19.141 --> 00:53:21.686
If I felt it was wrong, I would
never let you do it.


641
00:53:22.144 --> 00:53:25.356
Now come on or you'll miss the bus.
Come on.


642
00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:33.280
How come you're wearing
a sari today?


643
00:53:33.364 --> 00:53:34.448
Isn't she looking pretty?

644
00:53:34.615 --> 00:53:35.741
Of course.

645
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.204
But she suddenly looks like, it's time
for her to get married.


646
00:53:40.371 --> 00:53:42.081
Why don't I get her married, then?

647
00:53:42.873 --> 00:53:43.874
Let's hurry up.

648
00:53:43.958 --> 00:53:46.419
We'll definitely miss the bus.
We'll take an auto.


649
00:53:52.675 --> 00:53:54.510
Where are my princesses going
dressed like this?


650
00:53:54.593 --> 00:53:57.596
-We are getting late.
-I am glad I met you.


651
00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.056
God bless you.

652
00:54:02.393 --> 00:54:03.686
I'm late today.

653
00:54:06.689 --> 00:54:08.107
Adi which way are you going?

654
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:09.442
Why don't you carry on?

655
00:54:10.401 --> 00:54:12.403
Aren't you very late today?

656
00:54:12.486 --> 00:54:13.863
Yes, we were discussing
the Gazdar case.


657
00:54:13.946 --> 00:54:15.364
Where are you going in such a hurry?

658
00:54:15.489 --> 00:54:17.783
Close by to meet a friend.

659
00:54:17.867 --> 00:54:19.952
-Get in, I'll drop you.
-No, it's okay.


660
00:54:20.036 --> 00:54:22.955
Get in, you'll waste money on
a taxi otherwise. Sit down.


661
00:54:25.207 --> 00:54:29.128
You haven't informed their
parents, have you?


662
00:54:29.211 --> 00:54:30.963
No, just a few college friends.

663
00:54:31.756 --> 00:54:35.885
Very good. I am tired of marrying
couples in the court.


664
00:54:35.968 --> 00:54:37.803
We're crossing the court,
let's hurry up.


665
00:54:37.887 --> 00:54:40.222
So, Aditya, what's happening these days?

666
00:54:41.223 --> 00:54:42.308
Nothing at all, dad.

667
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:45.436
I am aware of everything
that is happening.


668
00:54:46.187 --> 00:54:47.188
What?

669
00:54:47.396 --> 00:54:49.815
You haven't completed your law studies,
and you've started a computer business.


670
00:54:49.899 --> 00:54:51.442
-Oh, you mean that.
-What "oh?"


671
00:54:51.525 --> 00:54:52.693
Where will you get the capital from?

672
00:54:53.277 --> 00:54:56.739
-The Bank is ready to give a loan.
-Really?


673
00:54:57.156 --> 00:55:02.995
-Only, if you sign the guarantee...
-Of course. It's your right.


674
00:55:03.412 --> 00:55:05.915
We have a debt to repay to you.
Isn't it our duty?


675
00:55:06.165 --> 00:55:07.124
Where is the groom?

676
00:55:11.295 --> 00:55:12.338
This is going to be interesting.

677
00:55:15.674 --> 00:55:18.677
Aditya, what are you doing at the temple?

678
00:55:19.678 --> 00:55:23.974
-So, this is a temple?
-You don't believe in God.


679
00:55:24.058 --> 00:55:27.937
So, what are you doing here?
You must have a reason.


680
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:30.773
What can I do, aunty? You have to
come here to get married.


681
00:55:30.856 --> 00:55:34.777
Oh, shut up! Anyway, God will
do his justice.


682
00:55:35.152 --> 00:55:38.364
Does he do his justice
in English or in Hindi?


683
00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.806
O beloved

684
00:56:04.932 --> 00:56:09.937
Listen, my darling
Listen my dearest


685
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:15.067
The moon will stealthily enter
Through the window, barefoot


686
00:56:17.653 --> 00:56:22.658
Listen, my beloved
Listen my love


687
00:56:25.035 --> 00:56:31.000
Listen, my beloved
Listen my love


688
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.175
Now, the fun starts.

689
00:57:41.862 --> 00:57:46.158
My wife has gone and all I am left with
is a receipt for our marriage.


690
00:57:48.285 --> 00:57:49.745
Be patient for a few days.

691
00:57:52.289 --> 00:57:56.835
How many days? 
Four, five or six?

692
00:57:58.003 --> 00:58:01.757
-Let Dina get married first.
-Then, ask her to get married.


693
00:58:02.216 --> 00:58:04.927
Why don't we get her married
next week itself?


694
00:58:06.387 --> 00:58:08.138
First, let me finish my internship
and meanwhile


695
00:58:08.389 --> 00:58:12.434
-you establish your business.
-You are being so boring.


696
00:58:13.185 --> 00:58:16.438
Do you know today is our nuptial night?

697
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.068
Can we meet somewhere?

698
00:58:21.777 --> 00:58:23.487
Right now, I am at Jeevan uncle's stores

699
00:58:24.238 --> 00:58:25.572
asking the rates for rice and lentils.

700
00:58:34.707 --> 00:58:36.000
What good night?

701
00:58:38.544 --> 00:58:40.087
All alone.
It's a lonely night.


702
00:58:55.644 --> 00:58:58.063
-Remove your hand. People are watching.
-So what?


703
00:58:58.147 --> 00:59:00.441
You are my legal wife.
Here's the certificate.


704
00:59:01.191 --> 00:59:05.237
-Why are you carrying this around?
-What can I do?


705
00:59:05.779 --> 00:59:07.531
This is the only substitute I have.

706
00:59:10.743 --> 00:59:12.745
Stop calling me your "wife."
And take off your hand.


707
00:59:13.412 --> 00:59:17.541
-Is she your wife?
-No, she is my life.


708
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.461
Sit properly.
This is a public bus.


709
00:59:24.214 --> 00:59:26.383
-Are you married?
-Yes, since 15 years.


710
00:59:29.595 --> 00:59:31.138
I pity your husband.

711
00:59:31.805 --> 00:59:32.848
Nothing.

712
00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.522
Suhani, there is a call for you.

713
00:59:58.207 --> 00:59:59.166
What is it?

714
00:59:59.249 --> 01:00:01.001
-I told you I love you.
-I know.


715
01:00:02.127 --> 01:00:03.962
Then, you should also know that
we both have the same address.


716
01:00:05.047 --> 01:00:10.928
Yet, we are both so far.
Tell me, you love me.


717
01:00:12.971 --> 01:00:14.848
Tell the doctor to check
his patients.


718
01:00:14.973 --> 01:00:18.060
I say, hang up.
Sir, it's an emergency case.


719
01:00:18.977 --> 01:00:21.021
We'll have to keep him
in intensive care.


720
01:00:22.147 --> 01:00:23.482
He sounds a little mad.

721
01:00:27.986 --> 01:00:30.781
-She didn't say it?
-Run.


722
01:00:50.968 --> 01:00:53.637
Sorry. You had to wait for two hours.

723
01:00:54.513 --> 01:00:57.433
To catch a glimpse of you,
I can wait for two lifetimes.


724
01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:00.436
I have to go.

725
01:01:01.937 --> 01:01:03.772
People are coming to see Dina.

726
01:01:28.922 --> 01:01:33.552
Come everyday to me
Turn the night into a day


727
01:01:33.635 --> 01:01:38.140
On the sly, under the
Sheet of the night


728
01:01:38.223 --> 01:01:42.311
Where even the moon can't approach

729
01:01:42.853 --> 01:01:46.398
Let's go behind a cloud

730
01:01:46.482 --> 01:01:51.862
Where every drop pines
Every drop is in turmoil


731
01:01:55.491 --> 01:02:00.871
Where time stops still

732
01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:05.834
Give us a hug under the
Sheet of the night


733
01:02:35.948 --> 01:02:39.451
In the warmth of the
Winter's sunshine


734
01:02:40.536 --> 01:02:44.164
Look at me with lowered eyes

735
01:02:45.123 --> 01:02:49.461
From behind your hand

736
01:02:49.795 --> 01:02:53.549
Blow hot and cold.

737
01:02:54.258 --> 01:02:58.136
Ever so softly in the raag Marva

738
01:02:59.054 --> 01:03:03.475
May our conversations happen

739
01:03:03.559 --> 01:03:08.230
Let not the day set.
Nor the night fall


740
01:03:08.313 --> 01:03:12.526
Let not the sun set

741
01:03:12.859 --> 01:03:17.197
And if it does, let not the
Morning break


742
01:03:17.364 --> 01:03:21.868
Let the night go on and on

743
01:03:40.721 --> 01:03:45.225
Lying to friends,
In somebody else's name


744
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:51.064
About you and me.
All through the night


745
01:03:54.693 --> 01:03:59.072
You're away too long.
It's so difficult


746
01:03:59.406 --> 01:04:02.284
To just sign and be contented

747
01:04:08.373 --> 01:04:12.919
When will the separation end?

748
01:04:17.883 --> 01:04:22.721
Come every day to me and
Turn the night into a day


749
01:04:26.725 --> 01:04:30.771
Without you, this wind from the east
seems silly


750
01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:44.451
It rushed into my scarf'

751
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.665
You also come and embrace me
Like this wind, some day


752
01:04:49.748 --> 01:04:53.335
Come and embrace me,
Like this wind


753
01:04:59.049 --> 01:05:03.720
Listen, dear friend

754
01:05:03.804 --> 01:05:09.726
If I can't sleep tomorrow,
Call me to you


755
01:05:12.813 --> 01:05:17.526
Keep my head your lap
And sing me a lullaby


756
01:05:22.197 --> 01:05:28.161
Hug me to you under the sheet
Of the night, on the sly


757
01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:37.462
Where even the moon can't approach.
Behind a cloud


758
01:05:50.934 --> 01:05:53.311
Dina is just like me,
she never keeps quiet.


759
01:05:53.395 --> 01:05:54.563
She talks a lot.

760
01:05:54.688 --> 01:05:57.274
If she starts, you'll cover your ears.

761
01:05:57.858 --> 01:06:00.777
She knows a lot. 
Very knowledgeable.

762
01:06:01.153 --> 01:06:03.071
She goes way too deep,
into the finer details.


763
01:06:03.447 --> 01:06:05.073
Don't go by what she says.

764
01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:09.161
Dina is very simple, very tolerant.

765
01:06:09.327 --> 01:06:12.831
She has taken the responsibility
of the entire household and...


766
01:06:12.914 --> 01:06:15.417
She never complains, isn't it?

767
01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:19.129
In fact, it's the same case
with Raghu.


768
01:06:19.713 --> 01:06:22.424
See, he hasn't even opened
his mouth so far.


769
01:06:23.091 --> 01:06:24.843
Just watching quietly.

770
01:06:25.302 --> 01:06:27.679
Raghu, why don't you say something?

771
01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.308
If you say yes, then, we'll proceed.

772
01:06:31.641 --> 01:06:35.937
-We are okay with everything.
-Me too.


773
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:42.277
-You should ask Dina as well.
-You don't worry about that.


774
01:06:44.196 --> 01:06:47.282
We invited you only after she agreed.

775
01:06:49.034 --> 01:06:54.372
When you give your consent,
we'll get an auspicious date fixed.


776
01:06:55.248 --> 01:06:59.419
You've already told me you
don't care for superstitions.


777
01:07:00.962 --> 01:07:05.342
Can I say something
if you don't mind?


778
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:11.348
Your younger daughter and my younger son
are both studying medicine.


779
01:07:11.431 --> 01:07:12.474
What's it called?

780
01:07:13.058 --> 01:07:16.436
Yes, he's doing
his Masters' in Bio-Technology.


781
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:21.691
I didn't ask him but I thought I'll ask
him now.


782
01:07:22.025 --> 01:07:23.735
and you ask your daughter too.

783
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:25.862
If everything works out,
then it will be great.


784
01:07:25.946 --> 01:07:28.824
Both brothers and sisters
can live in the same house.


785
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:36.373
What are you saying, mom?
How can this be?


786
01:07:36.706 --> 01:07:40.085
If it can, what's wrong with it?

787
01:07:40.168 --> 01:07:42.379
It's like a yard sale.
Buy one, get one free.


788
01:07:42.462 --> 01:07:48.009
We are not selling our daughters.
They haven't even asked for a dowry.


789
01:07:48.301 --> 01:07:52.556
The boy is well educated.
This is a stroke of good fortune.


790
01:07:52.639 --> 01:07:55.600
-I don't need this kind of fortune.
-Speak softly.


791
01:07:57.269 --> 01:08:00.105
-Wear this.
-What's wrong in this?


792
01:08:00.188 --> 01:08:03.275
I won't do it.
Mom, I cannot marry.


793
01:08:03.567 --> 01:08:07.487
You'll put Dina's marriage in jeopardy.
Now wear this!


794
01:08:14.035 --> 01:08:16.788
She got worried at the mention
of marriage.


795
01:08:19.499 --> 01:08:21.710
Even I had gotten scared.

796
01:08:22.335 --> 01:08:28.133
If I had known about this,
I never would have come.


797
01:08:28.383 --> 01:08:31.219
But, that's how my father is.

798
01:08:31.595 --> 01:08:34.431
He throws the ball in your court
and you have to catch it.


799
01:08:41.313 --> 01:08:43.690
Are you okay with it?

800
01:08:50.697 --> 01:08:51.907
I am already married.

801
01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:07.422
My parents don't know.
I married secretly in the court.


802
01:09:09.174 --> 01:09:10.425
They don't know anything.

803
01:09:52.425 --> 01:09:55.929
11.30 PM, Marine Lines Station.

804
01:10:28.628 --> 01:10:32.132
Railway Colony, Mumbai.

805
01:10:35.844 --> 01:10:37.012
Is Suhani here?

806
01:10:37.679 --> 01:10:39.389
There is no one by that name here.

807
01:10:41.516 --> 01:10:42.684
Go away from here.

808
01:10:52.485 --> 01:10:53.653
Where is Suhani?

809
01:11:08.626 --> 01:11:11.713
Where is Suhani?

810
01:11:13.381 --> 01:11:16.217
-Where is Dina?
-She's not at home.


811
01:11:22.348 --> 01:11:24.392
You tell me where Suhani is.

812
01:11:24.726 --> 01:11:25.894
What's happened to her?

813
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:32.192
I don't know.

814
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.906
She left the hospital at 5.

815
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:45.538
It's 11 now, no sign of her.

816
01:11:48.958 --> 01:11:50.752
I've gone home twice.

817
01:11:52.212 --> 01:11:53.463
There is no news of her.

818
01:11:53.671 --> 01:11:57.008
So, where has she gone?
You must have said something to her.


819
01:12:09.938 --> 01:12:13.525
-22 years. Height 5 feet.
-And 2 inches!


820
01:12:14.359 --> 01:12:19.531
Height 5 feet 2 inches.
Wearing a light brown Sari.


821
01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:25.703
A doctor's coat, hand bag,
stethoscope.


822
01:12:26.371 --> 01:12:28.540
Sir, there is a
hospital ID card as well.

823
01:12:29.582 --> 01:12:31.292
Hospital ID-card.
Yes, just check and call me.


824
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:34.420
Yeah, find out soon.

825
01:12:36.005 --> 01:12:37.090
Call me immediately.

826
01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:01.698
-Uncle, are you leaving?
-Yes.


827
01:13:01.781 --> 01:13:04.242
-Away from home?
-Yes.


828
01:13:35.273 --> 01:13:36.733
Dina should be crying,

829
01:13:36.941 --> 01:13:38.443
for you've ruined her wedding.

830
01:13:39.235 --> 01:13:40.612
I don't want to marry.

831
01:13:41.237 --> 01:13:42.947
Yes, why would you want to marry?

832
01:13:43.698 --> 01:13:45.408
She is the one
who was in a hurry.

833
01:13:45.909 --> 01:13:49.579
The elder one is still unmarried
and the younger one has no patience.


834
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.834
In six months she'll be pregnant
and on the streets.


835
01:14:01.591 --> 01:14:05.345
Get lost. There is no place for
you in this house.


836
01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.097
Be sensitive,
he's leaving the house.


837
01:14:08.306 --> 01:14:12.518
Whose house? When was this his house?
This is my house.


838
01:14:12.894 --> 01:14:15.438
Aditya, don't go.

839
01:14:16.022 --> 01:14:18.524
The one who's asking him to stay
can leave as well.


840
01:14:45.969 --> 01:14:47.011
Let it be.

841
01:14:55.603 --> 01:14:56.813
Get out of my house.

842
01:15:21.921 --> 01:15:24.549
Going forward, we will never speak
to them again.


843
01:15:25.466 --> 01:15:28.845
We'll never show them our faces again.

844
01:15:30.138 --> 01:15:31.973
-We're enough for each other.
-Okay.


845
01:15:32.724 --> 01:15:34.017
Take me to the temple.

846
01:15:34.267 --> 01:15:37.228
-Why? Do you want to marry again?
-Shut up and get in.


847
01:15:37.562 --> 01:15:39.731
Okay, let's go.

848
01:15:51.909 --> 01:15:57.707
We carry the burdens of the world
On our heads


849
01:15:58.041 --> 01:16:01.461
-What are you doing? Be careful.
-Thank you. At least you noticed.


850
01:16:02.295 --> 01:16:04.255
The stove is a gift from me.
Get your own gas cylinder.


851
01:16:04.464 --> 01:16:05.882
I can gift you a matchbox.

852
01:16:09.177 --> 01:16:11.637
-What is all this?
-It belongs to my brother.


853
01:16:12.055 --> 01:16:13.306
Does he drink here?

854
01:16:13.389 --> 01:16:15.850
All this will get shifted inside.
He'll drink on the other side.


855
01:16:15.933 --> 01:16:17.477
This part of the house belongs to you.

856
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.523
Kids, eloping has one big advantage.

857
01:16:23.483 --> 01:16:27.320
The girl won't threaten to go back
to her parents' house.


858
01:16:27.653 --> 01:16:31.616
That is true.

859
01:16:31.699 --> 01:16:35.578
-Yes, but there is also a problem.
-What's that?


860
01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.997
You'll get used to eloping with girls

861
01:16:38.331 --> 01:16:39.832
and keep running away every now and then.

862
01:16:40.208 --> 01:16:43.169
Did you weigh the pros and cons
when you eloped with aunty?


863
01:16:43.252 --> 01:16:45.755
No, she convinced me to elope
with her.


864
01:16:45.838 --> 01:16:47.256
Really? How did that happen?

865
01:16:48.007 --> 01:16:50.760
I had a bit too much to drink.
I got very emotional.


866
01:16:51.177 --> 01:16:54.013
-Let's go. Put that down.
-There is some left.


867
01:16:58.226 --> 01:16:59.644
What's the matter.
You seem to be very happy.


868
01:16:59.727 --> 01:17:01.896
Excited?

869
01:17:24.877 --> 01:17:29.924
Soaring
Are my dreams


870
01:17:30.299 --> 01:17:35.555
My heart dreams
Of colorful nights


871
01:17:54.907 --> 01:17:59.996
The light mist that
Descended last night


872
01:18:00.079 --> 01:18:02.748
Left my eyes brimming

873
01:18:02.832 --> 01:18:05.835
As it pattered on my hands

874
01:18:05.918 --> 01:18:10.465
The joy of getting drenched in the
First rains of the season


875
01:18:11.215 --> 01:18:13.718
I was drenched in the first rains,
Without a regret


876
01:18:13.801 --> 01:18:18.556
All over town, without a regret

877
01:18:25.021 --> 01:18:27.607
Like her plaits in knots,
Coming free


878
01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:29.901
It poured all night

879
01:18:30.276 --> 01:18:32.778
At times, coaxing.
At times, tormenting


880
01:18:32.862 --> 01:18:35.490
Like the moods of my beloved

881
01:18:58.304 --> 01:19:03.559
When I tease her out of love,
Sometimes she sulks


882
01:19:03.851 --> 01:19:06.103
Even when I let go in
A fit of anger,


883
01:19:06.604 --> 01:19:09.065
I have a battle on my hands

884
01:19:14.695 --> 01:19:19.700
Even if I simply kiss her,
I still have a battle to cope with


885
01:19:19.784 --> 01:19:25.039
The light of my eyes
Means the life to me


886
01:19:25.289 --> 01:19:30.127
In my eyes I preserve this life,
It's only for you


887
01:19:30.836 --> 01:19:34.340
This is life...

888
01:19:47.353 --> 01:19:50.106
All over town, without a regret.
Like her plaits in knots


889
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:52.900
Coming free, It poured all night

890
01:19:53.192 --> 01:19:55.820
When I tease her out of love

891
01:19:55.903 --> 01:19:58.573
Sometimes she sulks
Even when I let go in a fit of anger


892
01:20:20.219 --> 01:20:25.266
Few are the moments of life
To spend them in disagreement


893
01:20:25.683 --> 01:20:30.521
I have been through death to put
Our fragile hearts together


894
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:36.319
Ask for anything and
I can present it to you


895
01:20:36.777 --> 01:20:41.657
But, do consider there are very
Few stars in the sky anyway


896
01:20:41.907 --> 01:20:46.787
The light of my eyes
Means the life to me


897
01:20:47.163 --> 01:20:51.959
Even though my eyes have often
Seen a sweet bitterness


898
01:20:52.043 --> 01:20:57.173
This life, this life of mine

899
01:20:57.923 --> 01:20:59.675
Without a regret

900
01:21:00.468 --> 01:21:06.098
All over town, without regret,
only for you


901
01:21:08.684 --> 01:21:11.395
Like her plaits in knots,
Coming free


902
01:21:11.479 --> 01:21:13.856
It poured all night

903
01:21:14.023 --> 01:21:19.153
Coaxing, tormenting
Like the moods of my beloved


904
01:21:19.945 --> 01:21:22.239
Soaring

905
01:21:22.448 --> 01:21:24.950
Are my dreams

906
01:21:25.076 --> 01:21:30.122
My heart dreams
Of colorful nights


907
01:21:30.873 --> 01:21:32.750
Soaring are my dreams

908
01:21:33.334 --> 01:21:35.544
My heart dreams
Of colorful nights


909
01:21:56.357 --> 01:21:58.943
Don't see through your right eye.
It's inauspicious.


910
01:22:03.322 --> 01:22:04.615
Where is the newspaper?

911
01:22:04.699 --> 01:22:07.243
I have been waiting for 15 minutes,

912
01:22:07.326 --> 01:22:08.703
hoping to be the first thing you see
when you wake up.


913
01:22:08.911 --> 01:22:10.454
All you want is the newspaper?

914
01:22:13.541 --> 01:22:16.460
Okay, I've taken a good look at you.
Where's the newspaper?


915
01:22:16.544 --> 01:22:19.547
At night you were making big promises.
What now?


916
01:22:19.714 --> 01:22:23.759
-Really? What was I saying?
-Liar.


917
01:22:24.343 --> 01:22:25.511
You aren't worried about your wife,

918
01:22:25.594 --> 01:22:27.221
but, you want to know
what's happening in Patna.


919
01:22:28.723 --> 01:22:30.975
-Please give me the paper.
-You won't get it.


920
01:22:31.142 --> 01:22:33.394
You can't get your wife
and the news together.


921
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:36.814
Suhani, where's the paper?

922
01:22:37.773 --> 01:22:40.526
-But, what's happened in Patna?
-Riots have broken out.


923
01:22:47.992 --> 01:22:48.993
Where is the paper?

924
01:22:49.076 --> 01:22:52.788
-Here's your hot news.
-What madness is this?


925
01:22:54.915 --> 01:22:56.751
-Hey kids! What's going on?
-Nothing.


926
01:22:56.834 --> 01:23:00.671
Why are you burning the house?

927
01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:04.675
-But, this is my house
-How's it your own house?


928
01:23:04.759 --> 01:23:08.554
That will happen when you pay the rent.
What did you tell Pushy?


929
01:23:08.637 --> 01:23:10.556
That you'd pay 5 months rent in advance.
Where is it?


930
01:23:10.639 --> 01:23:15.227
-I meant the first of the month.
-That was a long time ago.


931
01:23:15.478 --> 01:23:19.231
-No, I meant the 1st of next month.
-Uncle, why don't you have some tea?


932
01:23:19.315 --> 01:23:21.066
It's getting cold, please drink it.

933
01:23:22.067 --> 01:23:26.906
Look, I cannot argue when she's around.

934
01:23:27.698 --> 01:23:31.452
-Poor thing has left her parents house.
-What about me?


935
01:23:31.535 --> 01:23:34.121
-Even I have left my parents house.
-Left the house?


936
01:23:34.371 --> 01:23:38.083
-They must have thrown you out.
-Uncle, have your tea.


937
01:23:41.212 --> 01:23:43.672
Meera, what happened to that Sintel file?

938
01:23:44.799 --> 01:23:47.218
Bhaskar is working on some more details.

939
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.095
Are you people following it up
properly or not?


940
01:23:50.179 --> 01:23:53.849
Of course we are. But, there has been
no response from their side.


941
01:23:53.933 --> 01:23:55.434
But, what is the problem?

942
01:23:55.518 --> 01:23:58.646
Until their American Co-coordinators
don't approve the project,


943
01:23:58.729 --> 01:24:02.274
-the deal cannot progress.
-Show me the file.


944
01:24:10.574 --> 01:24:14.620
Sorry, wrong number.
Call for some Anil Mehta.


945
01:24:19.416 --> 01:24:20.501
I had gone to buy vegetables.

946
01:24:20.584 --> 01:24:22.837
I've been waiting here for an hour.

947
01:24:25.548 --> 01:24:27.925
If you were going to take that long,
you should've left the keys with someone.


948
01:24:28.092 --> 01:24:29.718
With whom? Pushy Aunty?

949
01:24:29.802 --> 01:24:30.886
And what if she'd asked for the rent?

950
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:33.097
So, should I just keep sitting
until her Excellency arrives?


951
01:24:33.848 --> 01:24:38.227
Do you think I went for a stroll?
I had gone to shop for our dinner.


952
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:42.147
But, what's the idea behind
making me sit like a guard?


953
01:24:42.231 --> 01:24:44.441
Why are you making a mountain
of a mole hill?


954
01:24:44.525 --> 01:24:46.902
You used to wait for two hours
at the station before marriage.


955
01:24:46.986 --> 01:24:49.196
We're you working there part-time?
Let's go.


956
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:53.534
-It was different back then.
-What?


957
01:24:53.951 --> 01:24:55.244
Different how?

958
01:24:55.578 --> 01:24:56.662
Open the door.

959
01:24:56.745 --> 01:24:58.664
-Because we weren't married?
-Yes. I mean, no.


960
01:24:58.747 --> 01:25:00.958
And now that we're married,
you don't care anymore?


961
01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:03.627
-When did I say that?
-But, that's what you implied.


962
01:25:03.836 --> 01:25:05.170
Give me the key.

963
01:25:05.337 --> 01:25:06.714
Don't change the topic.

964
01:25:06.964 --> 01:25:09.133
Why don't you say it clearly
that you don't need me anymore.


965
01:25:09.216 --> 01:25:11.135
Now, why are you splitting hairs?
Give me the keys.


966
01:25:12.636 --> 01:25:13.971
I won't give him any food.

967
01:25:14.054 --> 01:25:18.058
Once he sleeps hungry, he'll realize.

968
01:25:20.394 --> 01:25:23.230
-And remember this incident.
-And even you remember this.


969
01:25:23.314 --> 01:25:24.690
Every time you fight with me,

970
01:25:24.773 --> 01:25:26.901
I'll keep on making
up with you like this.

971
01:25:26.984 --> 01:25:27.985
Let go of me.

972
01:25:30.321 --> 01:25:31.447
Now now.

973
01:25:31.947 --> 01:25:33.490
That's what you said before
marriage also.


974
01:25:33.574 --> 01:25:35.951
Exactly. Because, unlike you,
I've not changed after marriage.


975
01:25:39.872 --> 01:25:41.040
Now, what is this?

976
01:25:41.582 --> 01:25:45.210
-I'll mark the days we fight.
-Why?


977
01:25:45.544 --> 01:25:48.172
To prove that getting married
is very risky business.


978
01:25:48.339 --> 01:25:52.217
That is true. Considering the way
you fight with me at night


979
01:25:52.509 --> 01:25:55.638
and bite and claw me.
Should I show you the marks?


980
01:25:55.721 --> 01:25:57.848
Do you want to see them?

981
01:26:00.017 --> 01:26:03.520
The mood is pleasant

982
01:26:04.813 --> 01:26:05.731
What's it?

983
01:26:05.814 --> 01:26:07.358
Looking for me?

984
01:26:07.816 --> 01:26:09.193
Where is my mangalsutra?

985
01:26:09.276 --> 01:26:12.029
Forget it, I am alive right here
and ready to be hugged.


986
01:26:12.112 --> 01:26:15.532
You took it off at night
saying it pricks.


987
01:26:19.078 --> 01:26:22.623
I am the symbol of your marriage.
Why don't you hug me?


988
01:26:23.332 --> 01:26:25.584
You prick even more.
Where is my mangalsutra?


989
01:26:26.752 --> 01:26:30.381
Aunty she'll ask for the rent.
Leave me, you shameless!


990
01:26:37.513 --> 01:26:39.473
-How was it last night?
-What?


991
01:26:40.057 --> 01:26:45.354
-Dhansak. Did you not eat it?
-Oh that! That was great.


992
01:26:45.604 --> 01:26:47.106
She cleaned up all of it.

993
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:49.525
Now, you don't even need
to clean the utensils.


994
01:26:49.817 --> 01:26:54.822
Why don't you go and take the recipe
from Aunty this evening?


995
01:26:57.616 --> 01:27:00.369
What is this mangalsutra
doing here?


996
01:27:00.452 --> 01:27:03.706
-Suhani, this should not be taken off.
-Yes.


997
01:27:03.789 --> 01:27:05.541
I have been searching for this
all morning.


998
01:27:05.624 --> 01:27:07.126
I'm sure you hid it.

999
01:27:07.209 --> 01:27:11.005
Why should I hide it?
I thought I should wear it.


1000
01:27:11.463 --> 01:27:13.716
Sometimes even the man should
look married.


1001
01:27:19.555 --> 01:27:21.140
-How much sugar?
-One spoon.


1002
01:27:31.775 --> 01:27:35.612
Here comes our friend. Wait and see.
He's going to start a fight.


1003
01:27:39.908 --> 01:27:41.035
Wait for a minute.

1004
01:27:43.829 --> 01:27:44.788
-How are you?
-Fine.


1005
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:48.709
-How are you? Having tea?
-Fine.


1006
01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:51.587
I'll just be back.

1007
01:27:58.135 --> 01:27:59.803
You won't start the fight, right?

1008
01:28:07.227 --> 01:28:09.730
Suhani, where is my project report file?

1009
01:28:10.314 --> 01:28:13.025
Are you listening to me?
Where is my file?


1010
01:28:14.735 --> 01:28:17.905
I've told you so many times
not to move my things around.


1011
01:28:22.326 --> 01:28:23.410
Why are you laughing?

1012
01:28:37.633 --> 01:28:41.887
-Please stop it.
-Suhani, take her out.


1013
01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:44.723
-Please come with me come.
-No, I won't go.


1014
01:28:46.433 --> 01:28:48.644
No, I won't leave.

1015
01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:53.857
If you don't let the doctors work,
what will they do?


1016
01:28:54.942 --> 01:28:57.611
Let them try. They'll try and save
your son.


1017
01:28:57.945 --> 01:29:01.657
He's been here for two days.
Nothing has been done.


1018
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:03.826
Why don't you say anything, doctor?

1019
01:29:15.295 --> 01:29:17.840
Suhani, what's there to eat?
I am very hungry.


1020
01:29:26.974 --> 01:29:29.977
-What happened?
-Let me stay like this.


1021
01:29:32.521 --> 01:29:35.691
-Everyone is looking.
-Let them.


1022
01:29:40.654 --> 01:29:41.864
I am your wife.

1023
01:29:42.698 --> 01:29:44.283
You're embarrassed to hug me?

1024
01:29:47.369 --> 01:29:48.579
Let your reasons be.

1025
01:29:49.037 --> 01:29:51.748
Can't you even ask
me how my day was?

1026
01:29:58.755 --> 01:30:02.426
How would I know what happened
at the hospital?


1027
01:30:02.593 --> 01:30:04.428
I was confused as to why...

1028
01:30:04.511 --> 01:30:08.515
-Don't touch me.
-Why not?


1029
01:30:10.267 --> 01:30:13.312
Forgot how you used to
figure out my mood on the phone?


1030
01:30:13.395 --> 01:30:15.689
"Why are you so restless?"

1031
01:30:16.106 --> 01:30:20.777
You knew if I had fought with mum
the moment you saw me.


1032
01:30:21.653 --> 01:30:25.824
You used to call me twice a day
just to know how I was feeling.


1033
01:30:25.908 --> 01:30:28.577
-Don't you remember?
-I remember.


1034
01:30:29.661 --> 01:30:31.872
In spite of living in the same city
and having a phone,


1035
01:30:32.289 --> 01:30:35.292
you used to send me telegrams
to cheer me up.


1036
01:30:35.375 --> 01:30:36.710
Where did all that vanish?

1037
01:30:38.587 --> 01:30:42.216
I am still ready to do all that.
But, when will you grow up?


1038
01:30:42.466 --> 01:30:46.720
We aren't college students anymore.

1039
01:30:47.179 --> 01:30:49.264
We are responsible for each other.

1040
01:30:51.683 --> 01:30:54.061
Do people stop loving after marriage?

1041
01:31:27.344 --> 01:31:28.720
Don't stare like that.

1042
01:31:30.806 --> 01:31:34.518
Do you think of us and wonder
if we're dead or alive?


1043
01:31:36.019 --> 01:31:37.562
Don't speak like that.

1044
01:31:38.313 --> 01:31:42.276
Not a day goes by
without thinking of you all.


1045
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:43.944
I had even called.

1046
01:31:44.695 --> 01:31:46.071
You could have come home.

1047
01:31:46.822 --> 01:31:48.031
How could I have?

1048
01:31:49.283 --> 01:31:53.787
Don't you remember what you and dad
said when you threw me out?


1049
01:31:55.747 --> 01:31:58.000
Your father's anger will be the end
of us all.


1050
01:31:58.583 --> 01:32:02.796
-He's in hospital.
-What's happened to dad?


1051
01:32:04.715 --> 01:32:06.133
I am not the doctor.

1052
01:32:06.216 --> 01:32:08.051
We've got a lot
of tests done, but...


1053
01:32:12.889 --> 01:32:14.349
These tests are for jaundice.

1054
01:32:16.059 --> 01:32:18.603
Mom, I want to see dad.

1055
01:32:21.773 --> 01:32:27.279
If you come, he will be pleased.
We came to call you.


1056
01:32:29.865 --> 01:32:32.909
But, don't tell him that we met.

1057
01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.508
Adi, Suhani is here.

1058
01:32:48.925 --> 01:32:50.886
Hi. What happened?
How come you didn't go to work?


1059
01:32:54.723 --> 01:32:57.434
Dad is in hospital.
Can we go and meet him?


1060
01:33:01.438 --> 01:33:06.234
Didn't you say that we wouldn't
keep in touch with them?


1061
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:12.449
-Now, what happened?
-Yes, but he is unwell.


1062
01:33:13.033 --> 01:33:15.911
-He's in the Railway Hospital.
-Who told you?


1063
01:33:16.745 --> 01:33:19.706
He's got jaundice.
He cannot be treated there.


1064
01:33:20.874 --> 01:33:22.000
Who told you all this?

1065
01:33:23.877 --> 01:33:27.464
Mom and Dina.
I met them in the train.


1066
01:33:29.257 --> 01:33:32.719
They know where we live
and where I work.


1067
01:33:35.514 --> 01:33:39.309
But, they didn't think it necessary
to tell me.


1068
01:33:39.559 --> 01:33:42.187
It's not that.
Why do you think like that?


1069
01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:48.610
I still remember my promise,
but you are forgetting yours.


1070
01:33:50.404 --> 01:33:53.615
He spent his entire life savings
to make me a doctor.


1071
01:33:54.866 --> 01:33:56.660
What good is my being a doctor if...

1072
01:33:56.743 --> 01:34:01.206
Dr. Suhani, if your education is
compelling you, then you may go.


1073
01:34:01.832 --> 01:34:04.626
Neither am I a doctor
nor am I compelled in any way.


1074
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:06.753
Why are you being so indifferent?

1075
01:34:08.046 --> 01:34:10.257
I don't have anyone else
except you and them.


1076
01:34:10.799 --> 01:34:13.343
We are the only ones they have.

1077
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:17.431
Suhani, I have not forgotten
that slap till today.


1078
01:34:20.934 --> 01:34:22.978
If you want to go, you may.

1079
01:34:53.717 --> 01:34:54.843
How's your father?

1080
01:34:58.805 --> 01:34:59.806
How would I know?

1081
01:35:02.726 --> 01:35:03.852
Didn't you go?

1082
01:35:05.187 --> 01:35:07.272
How could I? I had promised.

1083
01:35:08.565 --> 01:35:12.736
Then, break the promise.
Let's go tomorrow.


1084
01:35:14.362 --> 01:35:15.989
What if he says something again?

1085
01:35:17.199 --> 01:35:20.410
When I've been slapped by him,
how does a little scolding matter?


1086
01:35:21.578 --> 01:35:24.289
Let's go tomorrow.

1087
01:35:30.545 --> 01:35:32.005
Even if he says something,
listen quietly.


1088
01:35:32.672 --> 01:35:34.090
Don't look sad.

1089
01:35:34.174 --> 01:35:37.052
I have worn this especially for you dad.
Don't I look smart?


1090
01:35:37.135 --> 01:35:40.514
Go fast. Something sad has happened.

1091
01:35:40.597 --> 01:35:42.098
-What?
-Go home.


1092
01:36:20.512 --> 01:36:25.225
Don't touch him.
Let his soul rest in peace.


1093
01:36:28.395 --> 01:36:32.941
No child would have
done this to their parents.


1094
01:36:34.651 --> 01:36:38.238
Now, take your husband
and leave our house.


1095
01:36:39.072 --> 01:36:40.323
Mother.

1096
01:37:10.895 --> 01:37:12.480
Daddy.

1097
01:37:44.679 --> 01:37:47.599
All my hopes are now pinned
on the Sintel project.


1098
01:37:49.601 --> 01:37:53.104
If we lose that, then,
we'll have to shut shop.


1099
01:37:55.148 --> 01:37:57.275
You know about the overheads.

1100
01:38:02.489 --> 01:38:05.909
Now, stop it please.
How long will you keep crying?


1101
01:38:07.911 --> 01:38:09.454
It's been so many days.

1102
01:38:09.537 --> 01:38:12.999
What should I do
if I feel like crying?

1103
01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:18.088
Had I not insisted on marrying,
all this would never have happened.


1104
01:38:19.339 --> 01:38:23.760
It was I who had insisted
on marrying secretly.


1105
01:38:24.427 --> 01:38:25.637
I was also impatient.

1106
01:38:25.762 --> 01:38:27.514
If you are repenting it,
why don't you leave me?


1107
01:38:28.848 --> 01:38:30.475
If I can live without my father,

1108
01:38:30.558 --> 01:38:33.269
I can live without you.
Leave me alone.


1109
01:38:47.492 --> 01:38:51.246
-What should I say?
-Read what's written, please.


1110
01:38:51.538 --> 01:38:54.207
-What if I get caught?
-It's just a little acting.


1111
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:55.542
Come on, now.

1112
01:38:56.042 --> 01:38:57.210
I'll give you one slap.

1113
01:38:57.293 --> 01:39:00.839
-Hello! This is...
-Like a coy woman.


1114
01:39:01.047 --> 01:39:04.300
Dina Sharma.
Do you remember me?


1115
01:39:05.218 --> 01:39:07.721
Mr. Sharma's daughter Dina?

1116
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:12.350
Yes, Miss Dina! What a surprise!
How are you?


1117
01:39:12.976 --> 01:39:18.523
-I am fine. I wanted to meet you once.
-Me? What for?


1118
01:39:19.232 --> 01:39:23.111
Meet me at 4 o' clock,
at the parking lot near Kala Ghoda.


1119
01:39:23.445 --> 01:39:26.823
Tomorrow.
Don't worry, I won't bite.


1120
01:39:39.794 --> 01:39:41.629
Can you connect me to Dina Sharma?

1121
01:39:49.262 --> 01:39:52.515
Miss Dina. Good morning,
this is Raghunath Pandit.


1122
01:39:53.516 --> 01:39:55.643
Maybe you didn't recognize me.

1123
01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.479
I recognize you very well.

1124
01:39:57.729 --> 01:39:58.980
What do you want from me?

1125
01:39:59.230 --> 01:40:00.857
I wanted to meet you.

1126
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:04.611
Why? Was it not enough to
insult my family?


1127
01:40:04.778 --> 01:40:09.949
That's why I want to make things right.

1128
01:40:10.575 --> 01:40:13.453
If you could meet me for 5 minutes.

1129
01:40:15.747 --> 01:40:17.499
Only for five minutes, please.

1130
01:40:18.625 --> 01:40:23.463
Meet me tomorrow at 4 o clock,
at the parking lot near Kala Ghoda?


1131
01:40:23.713 --> 01:40:25.465
I would be grateful.

1132
01:40:38.895 --> 01:40:40.021
Give me one Mid
-Day.

1133
01:41:00.625 --> 01:41:03.169
-Is that Raghu?
-It sure looks like him.


1134
01:41:04.212 --> 01:41:06.339
We were totally ruined after
that incident.


1135
01:41:06.923 --> 01:41:11.886
Dad passed away soon after.
But, why should it concern you you?


1136
01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:16.015
I am sorry for what has happened.

1137
01:41:17.767 --> 01:41:21.354
But, it's unfair of you
to blame me for all of it.


1138
01:41:21.688 --> 01:41:24.607
If that is your attitude,
why did you want to meet me?


1139
01:41:24.941 --> 01:41:26.234
Why did you call me here?

1140
01:41:27.527 --> 01:41:31.239
Excuse me, but it was you who
called me on the phone.


1141
01:41:31.406 --> 01:41:33.074
Otherwise, why would I have come?

1142
01:41:33.908 --> 01:41:35.076
You called me.

1143
01:41:35.159 --> 01:41:38.371
You think I'm mad to call and ask you
to meet me?


1144
01:41:38.705 --> 01:41:39.998
What do you think I am?

1145
01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:42.750
Looks like they are fighting.

1146
01:41:47.088 --> 01:41:48.464
Here is your coconut water.

1147
01:41:49.257 --> 01:41:50.300
I'm leaving.

1148
01:41:51.926 --> 01:41:56.556
-Did you not call me at the factory?
-Why should I?


1149
01:41:57.181 --> 01:42:00.018
You called me at the Bank.

1150
01:42:00.101 --> 01:42:04.439
I did speak to you.

1151
01:42:05.356 --> 01:42:07.609
But you're the one who asked me
to come here.


1152
01:42:09.027 --> 01:42:10.111
Maybe you are...

1153
01:42:14.365 --> 01:42:15.491
Oh God!

1154
01:42:31.382 --> 01:42:32.675
So, this was your doing.

1155
01:42:33.384 --> 01:42:36.304
What do you think you are?
A matchmaker?


1156
01:42:36.930 --> 01:42:38.890
Do you want to start
a marriage bureau?


1157
01:42:39.641 --> 01:42:41.267
I'm sorry.

1158
01:42:42.185 --> 01:42:43.728
I'm really very sorry.

1159
01:42:45.605 --> 01:42:50.777
Your engagement was broken up
because of us, so I thought...


1160
01:43:01.704 --> 01:43:03.581
It's okay. Your intentions were good.

1161
01:43:06.209 --> 01:43:10.380
But, you didn't do well
especially with Dina.


1162
01:43:29.065 --> 01:43:32.193
It's been ten days
since we spoke to each other.


1163
01:43:32.485 --> 01:43:35.863
It's not unusual after marriage.

1164
01:43:36.614 --> 01:43:40.493
Look at Raj and I.
We don't speak for months.


1165
01:43:41.035 --> 01:43:43.162
All our exchanges are through
the servants.


1166
01:43:44.664 --> 01:43:47.792
I think Adi is
sick and tired of me.

1167
01:43:47.875 --> 01:43:49.419
Don't be stupid.

1168
01:43:50.086 --> 01:43:53.464
Everyone says that if Adi ever flirts
with another girl,


1169
01:43:53.798 --> 01:43:55.133
he'll see you in her.

1170
01:43:56.259 --> 01:43:57.635
Is that any less worrisome?

1171
01:44:08.104 --> 01:44:09.147
How is it?

1172
01:44:10.565 --> 01:44:13.651
Looks like someone is very thirsty.
Why?


1173
01:44:13.735 --> 01:44:15.361
The other day when I was giving
you coconut water,


1174
01:44:15.445 --> 01:44:18.614
you were glaring at me.
Am I a matchmaker?


1175
01:44:18.698 --> 01:44:20.366
I should start a marriage bureau.

1176
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:22.076
I think after this success,
I should start one.


1177
01:44:22.493 --> 01:44:24.287
And when should we make arrangements
for the wedding band?


1178
01:44:25.288 --> 01:44:27.248
Raghu, will you come on a white horse?

1179
01:44:27.331 --> 01:44:28.583
Or should I get a black train
booked for you?


1180
01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:30.293
His family is coming home
day after tomorrow.


1181
01:44:30.418 --> 01:44:32.378
Once things are finalized,
you go ahead.


1182
01:44:38.342 --> 01:44:39.302
What happened?

1183
01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:44.348
I wish Dad were still alive.

1184
01:44:46.434 --> 01:44:49.395
Now drink this and stop the water works.

1185
01:45:21.511 --> 01:45:25.056
-I have ordered some food.
-What for?


1186
01:45:25.723 --> 01:45:28.267
Damn, sorry. I forgot to tell you.

1187
01:45:28.351 --> 01:45:30.603
My friends didn't have a place
to party,


1188
01:45:30.686 --> 01:45:33.856
-so, I called them here.
-I don't want to party.


1189
01:45:34.107 --> 01:45:35.066
Did you ask me?

1190
01:45:36.359 --> 01:45:40.988
I didn't, but, Anju requested
and I said yes.


1191
01:45:41.823 --> 01:45:44.283
Is Anju going to decide
what happens in my house?


1192
01:45:50.832 --> 01:45:52.959
You should have asked me, right?

1193
01:45:59.715 --> 01:46:01.801
So many people
and so little common sense.


1194
01:46:01.884 --> 01:46:04.220
An open door opens like this
and not like this.


1195
01:46:12.145 --> 01:46:13.271
She'll just be here.

1196
01:46:14.188 --> 01:46:17.275
You were very scared of your parents,
how did they agree?


1197
01:46:17.358 --> 01:46:20.319
-I had to smuggle her out
-You are quite brave.


1198
01:46:20.403 --> 01:46:24.365
This is nothing. One day she took Bhaskar
to meet her parents.


1199
01:46:26.617 --> 01:46:28.619
You are quite an intelligent girl.

1200
01:46:28.703 --> 01:46:31.372
How did you ever get stuck
with this Bhaskar?


1201
01:46:31.789 --> 01:46:34.000
The same way I got stuck with her.

1202
01:46:36.627 --> 01:46:40.089
The minute I looked at her,
my mind started to wander.


1203
01:46:42.049 --> 01:46:43.509
You are a very discouraging friend.

1204
01:46:43.593 --> 01:46:45.219
Get married first,

1205
01:46:45.303 --> 01:46:46.929
then, you'll have to find out
the price of food grains.


1206
01:46:48.806 --> 01:46:50.099
Yes, from Jeevan stores.

1207
01:46:50.308 --> 01:46:53.227
Suhani knows the rates quite well.
Remember?


1208
01:46:54.854 --> 01:46:57.231
Men show their true colors
after marriage.


1209
01:46:59.108 --> 01:47:00.151
How's that?

1210
01:47:00.651 --> 01:47:05.031
Before marriage they are
piling on to you everywhere.


1211
01:47:05.823 --> 01:47:09.285
And after marriage they are
embarrassed to even hold you.


1212
01:47:10.244 --> 01:47:11.495
Does that really happen?

1213
01:47:11.579 --> 01:47:14.081
Yeah, I'm embarrassed at my doing,

1214
01:47:14.415 --> 01:47:17.418
so the easy way out is a mangalsutra
to wear around the neck.


1215
01:47:17.668 --> 01:47:20.004
Before marriage,
her man is special to her.


1216
01:47:21.839 --> 01:47:24.759
After marriage, he becomes part of
the everyday.


1217
01:47:25.801 --> 01:47:28.262
For me, Adi can never be ordinary.

1218
01:47:34.268 --> 01:47:37.980
-I should have married you.
-What had to happen has happened.


1219
01:47:38.064 --> 01:47:39.857
You guys are discouraging me
from getting married,


1220
01:47:40.107 --> 01:47:42.485
but remember tomorrow's
engagement party, right?


1221
01:47:47.949 --> 01:47:50.576
-You're done with me, right?
-What?


1222
01:47:52.578 --> 01:47:53.663
What were you saying?

1223
01:47:55.581 --> 01:47:59.752
Come on Suhani,
you know I was joking.


1224
01:48:00.294 --> 01:48:04.966
It didn't sound like a joke to me.
Have I become stale


1225
01:48:05.633 --> 01:48:07.718
or have you started to like someone else?

1226
01:48:08.135 --> 01:48:09.679
Stop this nonsense.

1227
01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.850
You never spoke like this
before marriage.


1228
01:48:17.019 --> 01:48:18.145
I am now.

1229
01:48:28.114 --> 01:48:29.615
Nothing has changed even now.

1230
01:48:29.699 --> 01:48:31.993
If you like someone else
you can go with her.


1231
01:48:40.418 --> 01:48:41.669
Now, where should I find
another destiny?


1232
01:48:42.545 --> 01:48:43.796
You were destined for me.

1233
01:48:44.588 --> 01:48:46.799
And now I have to live with this
all my life.


1234
01:48:52.138 --> 01:48:57.143
This what you do.
Taunt first and then cry.


1235
01:49:03.899 --> 01:49:08.446
Do I trouble you so much?
What is my fault?


1236
01:49:10.948 --> 01:49:15.494
My fault is that I left my parents
for you.


1237
01:49:16.329 --> 01:49:17.496
Then, go back to them.

1238
01:50:07.546 --> 01:50:10.674
A history of atrocities

1239
01:50:10.925 --> 01:50:14.220
And yet, you claim authority

1240
01:50:14.970 --> 01:50:17.181
A history of atrocities

1241
01:50:17.765 --> 01:50:20.476
And yet, you claim authority

1242
01:50:28.317 --> 01:50:31.779
You take us by the hand
And hurt us


1243
01:50:32.113 --> 01:50:37.201
Good Heavens, no!
Good Heavens, no!


1244
01:50:39.203 --> 01:50:41.664
Good Heavens, no!
Good Heavens, no!


1245
01:50:42.164 --> 01:50:45.668
This is not done

1246
01:50:45.876 --> 01:50:49.338
A history of atrocities

1247
01:50:49.422 --> 01:50:52.800
And it's blown out
Of proportions


1248
01:50:52.883 --> 01:50:56.220
The lies in the world
Now threaten my life


1249
01:50:56.595 --> 01:50:58.139
They're the ones who
Inflict atrocities


1250
01:50:58.222 --> 01:50:59.890
And they're the ones who complain

1251
01:50:59.974 --> 01:51:03.310
Good Heavens, no!

1252
01:51:03.853 --> 01:51:06.355
Good Heavens, no!

1253
01:51:10.151 --> 01:51:15.197
This is not done

1254
01:51:38.429 --> 01:51:41.515
Friends

1255
01:51:41.849 --> 01:51:47.771
How am I to spend a lifetime
Misled by illusions?


1256
01:51:48.772 --> 01:51:53.402
If only I could take away
Your illusions


1257
01:51:55.738 --> 01:52:00.618
Take away this affliction
Of love too


1258
01:52:00.951 --> 01:52:05.289
Let that be or else
How will you manage?


1259
01:52:07.833 --> 01:52:12.880
Your attitude, your involvement
Shall lead us on


1260
01:52:15.174 --> 01:52:20.387
Life's a boat sailing
Miles across the sea


1261
01:52:22.431 --> 01:52:28.395
We'll have to drown in it,
There's miles of sea ahead


1262
01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:32.900
A history of atrocities

1263
01:52:32.983 --> 01:52:36.237
And the pot calling
The kettle black


1264
01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:39.573
The lies in the world
Now threaten my life


1265
01:52:39.657 --> 01:52:42.910
They're the ones who inflict atrocities
And they're the ones who complain


1266
01:52:42.993 --> 01:52:48.791
Good Heavens, no!
Good Heavens, no!


1267
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:52.878
Good Heavens, no!
Good Heavens, no!


1268
01:52:53.587 --> 01:52:58.551
This is not done

1269
01:53:23.284 --> 01:53:25.494
I've been looking for you everywhere!

1270
01:53:26.287 --> 01:53:27.830
Why? Is it something important?

1271
01:53:28.414 --> 01:53:33.711
Yes, it's important,
but now I am suddenly shy.


1272
01:53:40.634 --> 01:53:41.760
You?

1273
01:53:43.887 --> 01:53:47.266
I thought, once things get finalized...

1274
01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:48.976
You were hiding it from me?

1275
01:53:49.059 --> 01:53:52.187
Of course not.
That's why I was looking for you.


1276
01:53:52.354 --> 01:53:54.231
I wanted to tell you in person.

1277
01:53:55.024 --> 01:53:57.943
I even stopped Aditya
from telling you anything.


1278
01:53:58.319 --> 01:54:02.948
Aditya knows about this?

1279
01:54:03.782 --> 01:54:06.035
-He's the one who made this happen.
-Yes.


1280
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:13.792
-Dina, I've got to meet Aditya.
-Go and meet Aditya.


1281
01:54:14.251 --> 01:54:16.503
-I have to go to Raghu's house.
-To meet your mother-in-law?


1282
01:55:00.255 --> 01:55:04.343
We've got the 90 million project
from Sintel software!


1283
01:55:10.641 --> 01:55:16.605
Through the window in bare feet
The moon will stealthily enter


1284
01:55:18.899 --> 01:55:21.485
O beloved, listen to me

1285
01:55:24.405 --> 01:55:27.074
Hey, what are you watching?
This is no film screening.


1286
01:55:27.241 --> 01:55:29.493
Hey you! Stop there.
Where are you going?


1287
01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.328
Sir, I have to go to the station.

1288
01:55:31.412 --> 01:55:32.663
Do I have to
write it down for you?

1289
01:55:32.746 --> 01:55:34.289
Can't you hear me?

1290
01:55:35.332 --> 01:55:37.751
You can't go from here.
There's been an accident.


1291
01:55:40.587 --> 01:55:42.923
-Take a U-turn and go back.
-Okay, sir,


1292
01:55:43.590 --> 01:55:44.675
Go on.

1293
01:56:06.196 --> 01:56:08.115
What are you doing?
Waiting for Suhani?


1294
01:56:08.198 --> 01:56:09.158
Like always.

1295
01:56:09.408 --> 01:56:12.286
If you married me, you wouldn't
have had to do all this.


1296
01:56:12.536 --> 01:56:14.288
If she doesn't come
in the next ten minutes,


1297
01:56:14.371 --> 01:56:15.873
we'll elope and get married
in a temple.


1298
01:56:23.422 --> 01:56:26.049
-Is Suhani there?
-She has left already.


1299
01:56:26.467 --> 01:56:27.551
Okay , one minute.

1300
01:56:27.634 --> 01:56:31.054
-Did she say where she was going?
-No, she left after the shift.


1301
01:56:31.638 --> 01:56:34.099
Are you sure she is not somewhere
in the hospital?


1302
01:56:47.070 --> 01:56:50.824
YASHWANT RAO I.A.S. RESIDENCE

1303
01:57:03.670 --> 01:57:04.713
What happened?

1304
01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:08.300
Who was driving? You?

1305
01:57:10.511 --> 01:57:11.970
What was the need to drive?

1306
01:57:12.346 --> 01:57:13.889
You don't even have a license.

1307
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:17.476
Are you okay?
Did anyone else get hurt?


1308
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:20.354
Did anyone?

1309
01:57:22.064 --> 01:57:25.442
-Tell me. Who was it?
-A girl.


1310
01:57:26.819 --> 01:57:29.446
How badly did she get hurt?
Tell me.


1311
01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:31.490
Is she alive?

1312
01:57:34.201 --> 01:57:37.579
I don't know.
I got scared and ran away.


1313
01:57:39.873 --> 01:57:43.919
It's all right. Did anyone
take her to the hospital?


1314
01:57:46.171 --> 01:57:47.714
Where did the accident happen?

1315
01:57:48.632 --> 01:57:50.092
Kennedy Bridge.

1316
01:57:53.262 --> 01:57:55.472
You relax. I'll go and see
what's happening.


1317
01:57:55.556 --> 01:57:58.433
-Don't go.
-You go on inside.


1318
01:58:11.655 --> 01:58:14.908
Has an accident case from Kennedy
Bridge been reported today?


1319
01:58:15.742 --> 01:58:17.286
Yes, a girl has been admitted.

1320
01:58:17.369 --> 01:58:19.580
-Is she your relative?
-What? Yes!


1321
01:58:21.373 --> 01:58:24.501
Inform Dr. Murthy and prepare
the O.T. You come with me.


1322
01:58:27.087 --> 01:58:28.755
Hurry up.

1323
01:58:35.387 --> 01:58:37.514
Doctor Khan, come to
the operation theater.


1324
01:58:43.312 --> 01:58:44.479
Is she the one?

1325
01:58:50.652 --> 01:58:51.737
She is critical.

1326
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:53.030
She has been hurt on her head.

1327
01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:56.450
Doctors can't operate on her until
someone takes responsibility.


1328
01:58:56.533 --> 01:58:58.118
-Name?
-Yashwant Rao.


1329
01:58:58.243 --> 01:59:01.496
-No, what's her name?
-Savitri.


1330
01:59:01.705 --> 01:59:04.333
-Savitri. Savitri what?
-Savitri Rao.


1331
01:59:05.042 --> 01:59:06.418
How are you related to her?

1332
01:59:07.002 --> 01:59:08.045
Husband.

1333
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:10.589
Good. Come with me.
Some papers have to be signed.


1334
01:59:17.679 --> 01:59:19.014
Where are you coming from?

1335
01:59:19.097 --> 01:59:20.182
From the North.

1336
01:59:20.265 --> 01:59:21.892
Meaning? Are you coming from Kashmir?

1337
01:59:22.142 --> 01:59:24.519
No sir. North Bombay Society, Juhu.

1338
01:59:25.646 --> 01:59:27.481
-And you?
-He is also...


1339
01:59:27.689 --> 01:59:30.442
-What's your name?
-Aditya.


1340
01:59:30.525 --> 01:59:31.693
Where are you going?

1341
01:59:33.695 --> 01:59:37.074
My wife left home in the morning
and hasn't returned.


1342
01:59:37.532 --> 01:59:39.910
-Have you lodged an FIR?
-Yes.


1343
01:59:40.243 --> 01:59:41.745
-Have you checked the hospitals?
-What?


1344
01:59:41.912 --> 01:59:44.206
A girl met with an accident
not far from here.


1345
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:45.749
Hospital?

1346
01:59:53.173 --> 01:59:56.051
Yes, I am speaking from the hospital.

1347
01:59:57.177 --> 02:00:00.430
Because of the commotion I could
not report it earlier.


1348
02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:03.350
No, there is no
need to cover it up.

1349
02:00:04.768 --> 02:00:09.773
Let the law take its course.
I wanted what?


1350
02:00:11.441 --> 02:00:16.488
No, her relatives have not
been found yet


1351
02:00:19.241 --> 02:00:21.743
Has an accident case of
a girl been reported?


1352
02:00:21.827 --> 02:00:23.370
-When?
-This evening.


1353
02:00:23.578 --> 02:00:26.164
-What's the name?
-Dr. Suhani. Suhani Sehgal.


1354
02:00:26.415 --> 02:00:28.000
There is no one by this name.

1355
02:00:28.458 --> 02:00:30.711
In an emergency case, they obviously
won't know the name.


1356
02:00:30.794 --> 02:00:33.547
Please check for a 22-23 year-old
married woman.


1357
02:00:33.797 --> 02:00:34.923
Just a minute.

1358
02:00:35.007 --> 02:00:39.094
Mrs. Savitri Rao.
Her husband is on the phone there.


1359
02:00:39.678 --> 02:00:41.179
His wife is in the trauma center.

1360
02:00:43.015 --> 02:00:45.267
-Is there any other?
-No.


1361
02:00:55.485 --> 02:00:56.945
I think we are being too pessimistic.

1362
02:00:58.071 --> 02:00:59.489
Never mind. Let's go home.

1363
02:00:59.865 --> 02:01:01.241
Maybe she has reached home.

1364
02:01:01.491 --> 02:01:03.076
Inform me as soon as you get
some information.


1365
02:01:03.744 --> 02:01:05.328
Yes, I am at Wadia hospital.

1366
02:01:22.012 --> 02:01:25.140
We cannot remove the clot
without a surgery.


1367
02:01:37.944 --> 02:01:40.322
No, you listen to what I'm saying.

1368
02:01:41.531 --> 02:01:44.910
Our area starts from this side
of the bridge.


1369
02:01:44.993 --> 02:01:47.370
If the blast is on that side...

1370
02:01:48.663 --> 02:01:50.624
Can't you see that I am talking
to someone?


1371
02:01:50.749 --> 02:01:51.792
I see that, sir.

1372
02:01:52.209 --> 02:01:53.126
For the past half hour

1373
02:01:53.210 --> 02:01:55.087
you are discussing the sides
of the bridge.


1374
02:01:55.837 --> 02:01:57.464
I'll call you back.

1375
02:02:00.383 --> 02:02:01.468
What is your problem?

1376
02:02:01.885 --> 02:02:04.137
Sir, it's been so long since
I lodged an FIR.


1377
02:02:04.221 --> 02:02:07.432
My wife is missing.
Have you found anything?


1378
02:02:07.516 --> 02:02:09.142
We'll tell you when we find out.
Now, go away.


1379
02:02:09.226 --> 02:02:10.519
Will the news travel to you?

1380
02:02:11.103 --> 02:02:13.980
Sir, at least make an attempt.
Have you inquired?


1381
02:02:14.064 --> 02:02:15.398
You might know who she has
eloped with.


1382
02:02:15.482 --> 02:02:16.608
Why are you wasting my time?

1383
02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.320
How dare you assault a cop
inside a police station?


1384
02:02:20.403 --> 02:02:21.530
How dare you talk about my wife?

1385
02:02:21.613 --> 02:02:22.614
Leave me. Let me go

1386
02:02:22.697 --> 02:02:23.782
What if I don't leave it?
What can you do?


1387
02:02:23.865 --> 02:02:24.991
Even you'll be reported missing.

1388
02:02:26.118 --> 02:02:28.036
Leave him!

1389
02:02:29.204 --> 02:02:32.207
Sir, he's the son of Barrister Seghal.

1390
02:02:32.290 --> 02:02:33.917
His wife has been missing
for so many hours.


1391
02:02:45.053 --> 02:02:48.056
I told you I'd take care of everything.
Why did you come here?


1392
02:02:49.474 --> 02:02:51.143
You are taking care of me.

1393
02:02:54.062 --> 02:02:57.232
The surgery is over
but your wife is still unconscious.


1394
02:02:57.357 --> 02:02:58.817
You'll have to wait.

1395
02:02:59.526 --> 02:03:03.280
-I hope there is nothing to fear?
-She's still in coma


1396
02:03:23.425 --> 02:03:24.676
We have located the FIR.

1397
02:03:25.302 --> 02:03:26.636
The girl's husband has lodged it.

1398
02:03:27.554 --> 02:03:28.805
His name is Aditya Sehgal.

1399
02:03:29.764 --> 02:03:30.807
It won't be difficult to trace.

1400
02:03:30.891 --> 02:03:32.392
You don't have to worry now.

1401
02:03:33.435 --> 02:03:34.895
Even he is tracing her frantically.

1402
02:03:37.355 --> 02:03:39.441
You both go home.
I'm here, isn't it?


1403
02:03:40.108 --> 02:03:43.278
No. We'll wait here.

1404
02:03:44.946 --> 02:03:46.573
Once we hand her over to him,

1405
02:03:47.908 --> 02:03:49.284
then, it's up to him.

1406
02:03:52.495 --> 02:03:53.955
What can the poor boy do
in this crisis?


1407
02:03:56.208 --> 02:03:59.669
Don't worry. Savitri didn't do
it deliberately.


1408
02:04:00.295 --> 02:04:01.421
It's an accident.

1409
02:04:03.089 --> 02:04:06.009
Whatever it is.
We'll wait here.


1410
02:04:09.971 --> 02:04:11.514
Okay I'll go and locate him then.

1411
02:04:21.983 --> 02:04:24.903
-Is there a Aditya Sehgal among you?
-Yes. I am.


1412
02:04:25.237 --> 02:04:29.241
Aditya, Did you lodge an FIR
about your missing wife?


1413
02:04:29.324 --> 02:04:31.993
-Yes, have you found anything?
-What was she wearing?


1414
02:04:32.077 --> 02:04:34.871
-A light brown sari.
-Any watch or handbag?


1415
02:04:34.955 --> 02:04:38.041
Yes, A watch, handbag, stethoscope.
I had mentioned everything.


1416
02:04:38.124 --> 02:04:39.251
-Come with me.
-Where?


1417
02:04:39.542 --> 02:04:44.422
To your wife. Come on, sit inside.

1418
02:04:58.770 --> 02:05:00.272
Over there. She is in the ICU.

1419
02:05:20.375 --> 02:05:23.253
Suhani. Open your eyes.

1420
02:05:25.547 --> 02:05:27.966
You would talk throughout the day.

1421
02:05:28.717 --> 02:05:30.093
Now, why don't you speak?

1422
02:05:31.344 --> 02:05:33.680
Say something. 
Open your eyes.

1423
02:05:36.099 --> 02:05:40.687
Are you angry with me?
Please don't be.


1424
02:05:42.022 --> 02:05:46.318
Open your eyes.
Say something, please.


1425
02:06:07.547 --> 02:06:08.715
Let us check.

1426
02:06:42.957 --> 02:06:45.126
That's the man whose car hit Suhani.

1427
02:06:46.127 --> 02:06:48.505
He's signed for the surgery as well.

1428
02:07:11.903 --> 02:07:14.322
How is she?

1429
02:07:20.954 --> 02:07:22.038
You should pray...

1430
02:07:24.499 --> 02:07:25.834
for yourself.

1431
02:07:29.421 --> 02:07:33.591
If anything happens to her,
I won't let you live in peace.


1432
02:07:50.066 --> 02:07:51.484
How did you hit her?

1433
02:07:56.239 --> 02:07:58.700
And why didn't you tell the police?

1434
02:08:05.707 --> 02:08:08.168
You were drinking and driving,
weren't you?


1435
02:08:20.263 --> 02:08:21.556
I won't let you get away.

1436
02:08:31.691 --> 02:08:32.984
It's not his fault.

1437
02:08:38.031 --> 02:08:39.491
Then, whose fault is it?

1438
02:08:42.368 --> 02:08:44.162
The one who is battling
for her life?


1439
02:08:45.330 --> 02:08:46.873
Nothing will happen to her.

1440
02:08:50.168 --> 02:08:53.588
Before it does, 
I will kill myself.

1441
02:09:03.973 --> 02:09:07.519
I hit her. It was my car.

1442
02:09:08.019 --> 02:09:09.646
Why should you be punished for that?

1443
02:09:09.729 --> 02:09:13.399
No harm will befall her.
There is a God above.


1444
02:09:15.068 --> 02:09:17.028
What we could do, we have done.

1445
02:09:35.797 --> 02:09:37.423
You can give us whatever punishment
you want to.


1446
02:09:40.468 --> 02:09:45.098
But, right now even we are praying
for your wife's recovery.


1447
02:11:24.614 --> 02:11:26.532
I know you are listening
to everything.


1448
02:11:29.744 --> 02:11:31.287
You are just pretending.

1449
02:11:33.373 --> 02:11:37.168
To trouble me, to fight with me.

1450
02:11:41.839 --> 02:11:45.802
Come now, get up. Right now.

1451
02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:52.558
Aren't you going to mark
the date on the calendar?


1452
02:11:55.687 --> 02:11:57.355
You didn't come home one day,

1453
02:11:59.107 --> 02:12:01.401
and everything is devastated.

1454
02:12:06.239 --> 02:12:07.865
I've never searched for you this much,

1455
02:12:08.991 --> 02:12:10.576
Not even before we got married.

1456
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:23.506
The truth is that today
I have understood our relationship.


1457
02:12:28.219 --> 02:12:32.265
For the first time I have understood you.
Found you.


1458
02:12:36.477 --> 02:12:37.645
Now, I can't lose you.

1459
02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:46.362
Till now I was only trying
to find myself.


1460
02:13:01.627 --> 02:13:02.754
Please, love.

1461
02:13:08.050 --> 02:13:09.177
Please come back.

1462
02:14:18.496 --> 02:14:19.539
Were you scared?

1463
02:14:20.957 --> 02:14:21.916
I died.

1464
02:14:26.379 --> 02:14:27.380
What did you think?

1465
02:14:29.090 --> 02:14:30.007
That I'm gone...

1466
02:14:30.132 --> 02:14:31.259
No.

1467
02:14:32.176 --> 02:14:33.511
And you can have fun?

1468
02:14:39.684 --> 02:14:41.519
I love you.

1469
02:14:46.983 --> 02:14:48.526
What can you do for me?

1470
02:14:50.027 --> 02:14:51.654
I love you.

1471
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:55.366
Can you jump off a moving train?

1472
02:14:58.160 --> 02:14:59.996
Never say that please, not even jokingly.

1473
02:15:21.392 --> 02:15:27.106
Keep laughing, keep laughing!

1474
02:15:27.648 --> 02:15:30.985
May your blushes of modesty
Continue to bloom


1475
02:15:31.444 --> 02:15:35.156
May dusk and dawn continue to meet where
your hair slides across your nape
