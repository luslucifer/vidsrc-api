00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:34.459
<i>In a certain time,</i>
<i>in a certain land,</i>


10
00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.459
<i>once there lived</i>
<i>and once there was...</i>


11
00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:42.826
<i>A magic kingdom</i>
<i>at the top of the world.</i>


12
00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:46.492
<i>If a traveler came</i>
<i>to that cold, freezing place,</i>


13
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.892
<i>and no traveler ever did,</i>

14
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:52.125
<i>all he would see</i>
<i>would be ice.</i>


15
00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:55.692
<i>Mountains of ice and snow.</i>

16
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:59.892
<i>But on certain nights, when the stars
of the sky shined like jewels,</i>


17
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.525
<i>a wonderful light</i>
<i>appeared in the heavens;</i>


18
00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:05.759
<i>and then many lights,</i>
<i>all the colors of the rainbow;</i>


19
00:02:05.828 --> 00:02:08.892
<i>and some colors</i>
<i>never seen before.</i>


20
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.425
<i>Way on top,</i>

21
00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:16.226
<i>the north star sparkled.</i>

22
00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:19.226
<i>And suddenly, the ice
mountains cracked open...</i>


23
00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:22.292
<i>And beautiful, beautiful</i>
<i>lights pierced the sky,</i>


24
00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:24.592
and then, out came
the vendegums.


25
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:28.409
Hundreds of them, all in their
bright-colored clothes.


26
00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:31.109
Granny,
what's a vendegum?


27
00:02:31.178 --> 00:02:34.776
A vendegum? Those
are the little men...


28
00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:36.942
Who live in
the ice mountains,


29
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.776
way at
the top of the world,


30
00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:43.042
under the north star.

31
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:45.875
Some of them are
even littler than you.


32
00:02:45.944 --> 00:02:49.709
This is the same story
she told last year.


33
00:02:49.778 --> 00:02:52.475
Oh, when's he coming?
When's he gonna get here?


34
00:02:52.544 --> 00:02:55.276
The road from the village
must be blocked.


35
00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:57.875
Even those reindeer of his
couldn't make it through.


36
00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:02.242
Wouldn't be Christmas without him, though,
would it? He hasn't missed one yet.


37
00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:05.725
It's them! Here they come!

38
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:30.425
<i>All right. Everybody back.</i>
<i>Everybody back, everybody back.</i>


39
00:03:34.994 --> 00:03:37.391
- What did you bring? What did I get?
- Wait.


40
00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:42.725
Don't I hear
something first?


41
00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:46.825
Happy Christmas,
Uncle claus!


42
00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:50.659
All right. All right. Here, for you.
And you. Thank you!


43
00:03:51.094 --> 00:03:54.392
Cutting wood all day
for the whole village.


44
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.159
It's enough
to exhaust any man.


45
00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:59.525
<i>How does he find time</i>
<i>to make all those things?</i>


46
00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:01.625
<i>He makes time.</i>

47
00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:05.958
What can I tell you?
It gives him pleasure.


48
00:04:12.327 --> 00:04:15.725
Little else.

49
00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:18.276
For you.
Just for you.


50
00:04:18.344 --> 00:04:22.442
What is it?
A vendegum.


51
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.709
<i>Just as I was</i>
<i>telling you.</i>


52
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:46.892
You can't see your hand in front of your
face out there. You won't get through.


53
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:50.592
My reindeer, donner and blitzen,
can get through anything.


54
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:52.592
Come along, Anya.
We must hurry.


55
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:54.892
More children need their toys on
the other side of the forest.


56
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.959
'Bye, dear.

57
00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:01.559
Okay.

58
00:05:04.161 --> 00:05:06.825
Bye!
Bye!


59
00:05:06.894 --> 00:05:09.992
Did you see their faces
when they saw the toys?


60
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:13.025
Ah, yes. They love their
Uncle claus, huh?


61
00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:22.559
Come on, blitzen.
Pull harder!


62
00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:24.625
The children
are waiting!


63
00:05:31.027 --> 00:05:34.258
Come on, donner.
Don't drag your hooves.


64
00:05:34.327 --> 00:05:37.425
Hurry along, now.
You can do it, boy.


65
00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:39.492
Come on!

66
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.792
<i>I can't find it, Anya.</i>
<i>I can't find the road.</i>


67
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.892
- Where are we?

68
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:18.076
Come on, boys.
Don't slow up now!


69
00:06:20.978 --> 00:06:23.525
Hi-up!
Hi-up!


70
00:06:23.594 --> 00:06:26.976
<i>Go! Come on!</i>
<i>Blast!</i>


71
00:06:36.444 --> 00:06:38.375
- Come on, blitzen.

72
00:06:38.444 --> 00:06:42.309
Come on, my good boys.
Donner! Now listen!


73
00:06:42.377 --> 00:06:45.943
Over there,
there's food and warmth...


74
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:48.076
And a bed
and straw and hay...


75
00:06:48.144 --> 00:06:51.976
And everything a smart team
of reindeer would like!


76
00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:54.742
<i>Here is where</i>
<i>you freeze to death.</i>


77
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:58.976
Now, come on, my good boys!
Come on!


78
00:06:59.045 --> 00:07:01.542
Claus, come back.
I can't see you.


79
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.642
Oh, my God.
Anya!


80
00:07:03.978 --> 00:07:06.625
Anya! Anya!

81
00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:16.692
Anya. Oh, my God. Anya! Anya!

82
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.725
Anya, please!
Oh!


83
00:09:47.794 --> 00:09:50.025
They're here.

84
00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:00.708
Welcome.

85
00:10:02.844 --> 00:10:07.775
It's them. Vendegum.
The little people?


86
00:10:07.844 --> 00:10:11.958
We prefer to be called
elves, if you don't mind.


87
00:10:12.027 --> 00:10:15.458
- You-you--
- I'm the one called dooley.


88
00:10:15.527 --> 00:10:18.958
- We've been expecting you.
- Expecting us?


89
00:10:19.027 --> 00:10:22.475
For a long, long time.

90
00:10:22.544 --> 00:10:25.208
We almost gave up hope!

91
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:27.375
<i>Where are we?</i>

92
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:33.308
- Home.
-<i>No, no, no. Our home is far from--</i>


93
00:10:33.377 --> 00:10:35.776
look at that! Let's go.
<i>Not anymore.</i>


94
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.425
<i>This is your home now.</i>

95
00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:40.893
W-what does he mean?

96
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.325
Uh, you don't understand.

97
00:10:43.394 --> 00:10:48.792
<i>We live in a village far away from
this one.</i> Blow! Bits of old ropes,


98
00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:51.074
single-hinge
runner connectors.


99
00:10:51.143 --> 00:10:53.074
This is unbelievable!

100
00:10:53.143 --> 00:10:55.409
<i>See I'm gonna have</i>
<i>a lot to teach him.</i>


101
00:10:55.477 --> 00:10:58.492
Whoops.
Hi, there.


102
00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:03.241
Hi. I'm the one
called patch.


103
00:11:03.444 --> 00:11:05.041
<i>Welcome aboard, sir. Speaking
for the boys and myself,</i>


104
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.541
I'd-- oh, you must
be the missus!


105
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.475
Me?
<i>Yeah. Well,</i>


106
00:11:10.543 --> 00:11:13.075
we were expecting someone nice, but
not someone so young and pretty.


107
00:11:13.144 --> 00:11:16.041
- <i>Were we, boys?</i>
- - No. No.


108
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.141
- Oh, don't be elf-conscious! - My
friends, let us show you your new home.


109
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.541
<i>Patch, take charge of the reindeer.</i> Yeah. Honka!

110
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.559
Take charge of the reindeer. Boog,
take charge of the reindeer.


111
00:11:24.628 --> 00:11:26.626
Vout, take charge
of the reindeer.


112
00:11:32.043 --> 00:11:34.742
<i>I don't understand.</i>

113
00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:37.975
What new home?
There's nothing here.


114
00:11:38.043 --> 00:11:40.441
Look again.

115
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.809
- Where did it come from?
- <i>It was always here.</i>


116
00:11:54.877 --> 00:11:58.242
But it can't be seen by
just anyone, you know. Mm?


117
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.108
Come, fellow elves. Take
them to their new home.


118
00:12:02.177 --> 00:12:05.108
<i>Lead and follow,</i>
<i>follow and lead.</i>


119
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.958
He's nice,
isn't he, patch?


120
00:12:18.027 --> 00:12:20.958
Yeah, I tell you, boys, he gives me
a real feeling of elf-confidence.


121
00:12:21.027 --> 00:12:24.258
What's it all about?

122
00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:28.526
Maybe it's a-- aah!
No, we're awake!


123
00:13:25.093 --> 00:13:27.325
It's him! He's here!

124
00:13:27.394 --> 00:13:29.392
Yes, he's here,
he's here!


125
00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:43.425
Welcome, welcome. I'm the one called puffy.
We've been expecting you.


126
00:13:43.494 --> 00:13:45.592
Not now, puffy. The man
wants to see the sights.


127
00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:48.957
- Isn't this something? - Did you
hear that? He said it's something!


128
00:13:49.026 --> 00:13:53.042
- He did. He did!
- Oh, my!


129
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.609
She likes it. She likes it!
She does. She does.


130
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.975
Isn't this<i>something</i>? Is it
warm enough for all of them?


131
00:14:09.044 --> 00:14:10.975
It's exactly what
I've been saying, ma'am.


132
00:14:11.044 --> 00:14:14.708
Now, I have an idea for a new way to
heat this entire place, using pipes!


133
00:14:17.611 --> 00:14:19.908
Pipes, you know?
Cylinder thingies?


134
00:14:19.977 --> 00:14:22.042
There's much more
to see, folks.


135
00:14:24.277 --> 00:14:26.375
Pipes.

136
00:14:28.077 --> 00:14:30.392
Pipes.
Yeah.


137
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.559
Wait! Wait!

138
00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:36.242
Oh!

139
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:47.542
My goodness.
What is all this?


140
00:15:47.977 --> 00:15:50.908
They're Christmas toys.
Waiting for you.


141
00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:54.075
For me.

142
00:15:54.143 --> 00:15:57.075
Wh-what have they
got to do with me?


143
00:15:57.143 --> 00:16:01.875
You're going to give
them to your children.


144
00:16:01.944 --> 00:16:04.375
Th-there must be a mistake.

145
00:16:04.444 --> 00:16:06.741
We have no children.
<i>You do now.</i>


146
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.741
You have all
the children of the world.


147
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.208
But how could I deliver
all these toys?


148
00:16:13.277 --> 00:16:15.675
I won't live
long enough for that.


149
00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:19.608
Both of you
will live forever.


150
00:16:20.077 --> 00:16:23.192
<i>Like us.</i>

151
00:16:29.977 --> 00:16:32.908
<i>Anya?</i>

152
00:16:32.977 --> 00:16:35.008
<i>Me too.</i>

153
00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:37.042
<i>I can't sleep either.</i>

154
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:42.475
<i>I don't want to sleep.</i>
<i>This mattress is so comfortable,</i>


155
00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:45.075
<i>I don't want to miss</i>
<i>a moment of it.</i>


156
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.741
<i>This-this won't take long.</i>
<i>I'll be right back.</i>


157
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.724
<i>What is it, donner, eh?</i>
<i>You look so frightened.</i>


158
00:17:08.793 --> 00:17:12.124
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>


159
00:17:12.194 --> 00:17:15.591
<i>Really, there isn't. Easy, boy,
it's all right. Easy, now, easy.</i>


160
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.957
Strange
place, strange companions.


161
00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:22.275
But we're all friends here.

162
00:17:22.343 --> 00:17:24.275
We are!

163
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:28.192
- Look at old blitz in there.
- Does he look worried? Hmm?


164
00:17:29.493 --> 00:17:31.891
Come on. Maybe try
and eat something. Hmm?


165
00:17:32.194 --> 00:17:35.475
It's great food.
Believe me.


166
00:17:35.543 --> 00:17:37.624
Say, look.
Even I like it.


167
00:17:37.693 --> 00:17:40.624
It's delicious.

168
00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:43.258
Mmm! <i>He's like me, I guess.</i>

169
00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:45.624
Oh! Yes.
A little confused.


170
00:17:45.827 --> 00:17:48.325
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.058
He's always been the fidgety type.
Yeah. Well,


172
00:17:54.126 --> 00:17:56.258
he'll be all right, sir, as soon
as he gets used to the place.


173
00:17:56.327 --> 00:17:59.558
He just needs a little
elf-control. Mm.


174
00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:01.558
Well, you certainly
know your reindeer.


175
00:18:01.626 --> 00:18:06.392
These are fine specimens. Oh! Hear that,
boys? You made a good impression.


176
00:18:06.459 --> 00:18:08.392
Come on.

177
00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:12.124
Look. These two are twins.
Prancer and dancer.


178
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.124
<i>The way you can tell them apart
is by those snooty monocles.</i>


179
00:18:16.194 --> 00:18:18.924
Prancer's is
on his right eye,


180
00:18:18.993 --> 00:18:20.724
<i>and dancer's is</i>
<i>on his left eye.</i>


181
00:18:20.793 --> 00:18:23.292
And this lad with the great
big antlers is comet.


182
00:18:24.294 --> 00:18:26.392
And old spotted-nose
here is cupid.


183
00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:33.158
This white-faced boy here,
that's old dasher.


184
00:18:33.227 --> 00:18:36.292
He loves to run, he does, he really does.
He'd rather run than eat!


185
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.724
And, uh, this noisy one with
the floppy jowls, he's ViXen.


186
00:18:39.793 --> 00:18:42.791
<i>Keep you up half the night</i>
<i>with his snorts and whinnies,</i>


187
00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:44.824
<i>whinnies and snorts.</i>

188
00:18:44.893 --> 00:18:46.824
And you sleep here?
Yes!


189
00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:49.991
And this is where
I do my other work.


190
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.325
Yeah, they keep you busy, huh?
Well, I-I-I like it that way.


191
00:18:53.394 --> 00:18:56.824
Sometimes I get so many ideas, I don't
know where to keep them in my head.


192
00:18:56.893 --> 00:18:59.358
<i>Um-- oh! Look.</i>

193
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.791
A clock that wakes you up in the morning.
How about that? Ha?


194
00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:05.791
That's not bad.
<i>Aha!</i>


195
00:19:05.859 --> 00:19:08.058
A plate that whistles
when the food's too hot.


196
00:19:08.126 --> 00:19:10.891
Ah?

197
00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:13.258
Um-- oh!
Look, look, look.


198
00:19:13.327 --> 00:19:16.124
<i>I've got here a
complete syste--</i> uh--


199
00:19:16.194 --> 00:19:18.258
what do we need
all these reindeer for?


200
00:19:18.327 --> 00:19:22.791
Uh, you'll see.

201
00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:25.391
This is a curious kind of place.
<i>This is nothing now.</i>


202
00:19:25.459 --> 00:19:28.824
- Wait till you see how it gets during
season's greetings. - Season's greetings?


203
00:19:28.893 --> 00:19:32.192
- <i>Mm-hmm. You'll see.</i>
- What's that?


204
00:19:33.327 --> 00:19:37.058
<i>Oh, look, sir.</i>
<i>Now he's having a bite.</i>


205
00:20:09.527 --> 00:20:12.424
- Ooh!
- Ooh!


206
00:20:12.493 --> 00:20:15.525
- Hurray!
- Hoop-ah!


207
00:20:21.443 --> 00:20:23.674
<i>♫</i>

208
00:20:58.426 --> 00:21:00.457
Maybe it's
the massive bulk of it.


209
00:21:00.527 --> 00:21:02.457
I never did
an extra-large before.


210
00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:06.725
No, the size is fine. Please
don't think I'm criticizing,


211
00:21:06.793 --> 00:21:08.825
but green's just
not his color.


212
00:21:08.894 --> 00:21:12.491
- <i>What about, um--</i>
- Brown!


213
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.491
Red.

214
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.491
Yes! Red!

215
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.491
Perfect!
Matches his cheeks...


216
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.558
<i>And everything!</i>

217
00:21:24.877 --> 00:21:26.974
Whee!

218
00:22:25.393 --> 00:22:28.207
Ah!

219
00:22:28.276 --> 00:22:30.207
Hey!

220
00:24:01.926 --> 00:24:05.658
- Oh. Well?
- Coming closer now. Not just yet!


221
00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:10.058
<i>Two more degrees</i>
<i>north by northwest--</i>


222
00:24:10.226 --> 00:24:12.107
now!

223
00:24:17.443 --> 00:24:19.691
Ohh!

224
00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:24.107
Ahh!

225
00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:37.558
- Season's greeting's back!
- Season's greetings!


226
00:24:40.293 --> 00:24:43.157
Season's greetings!
Season's greetings!


227
00:25:12.509 --> 00:25:18.140
Southeast crosswind,
point right. Northwest--


228
00:25:18.209 --> 00:25:20.575
are you nervous?

229
00:25:20.643 --> 00:25:24.608
Me, nervous? No.

230
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.240
Oh!

231
00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:32.174
You look...
Wonderful to me.


232
00:25:32.242 --> 00:25:35.808
Uh, it does suit me,
doesn't it?


233
00:25:35.877 --> 00:25:39.340
A handsome man looks good
in anything.


234
00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:44.942
Oh, I'm so
proud of you.


235
00:25:45.009 --> 00:25:46.942
Mm!

236
00:25:49.376 --> 00:25:52.641
It's time, sir.
Oh.


237
00:25:57.076 --> 00:25:59.791
- They're waiting.

238
00:26:30.026 --> 00:26:31.957
<i>He looks wonderful!</i>

239
00:26:32.026 --> 00:26:35.041
It's a perfect fit,
if I do say so myself.


240
00:26:35.109 --> 00:26:39.941
The color, the style.. that outfit is
him, boys. I'm telling you. Just him.


241
00:27:52.226 --> 00:27:54.590
The prophecy...

242
00:27:54.659 --> 00:27:56.990
Has come to pass...

243
00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:00.157
That there would
come to us...


244
00:28:00.226 --> 00:28:02.224
A chosen one.

245
00:28:02.293 --> 00:28:07.090
<i>And that he, having</i>
<i>no child of his own,</i>


246
00:28:07.159 --> 00:28:11.324
<i>would love all</i>
<i>children, everywhere.</i>


247
00:28:12.492 --> 00:28:14.457
<i>And that he himself</i>
<i>would be...</i>


248
00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:17.724
An artisan,
and a craftsman,


249
00:28:19.126 --> 00:28:21.757
<i>and a skilled...</i>

250
00:28:21.827 --> 00:28:24.791
<i>Maker of toys.</i>

251
00:28:24.859 --> 00:28:29.357
And now, chosen one,
come forward.


252
00:28:37.159 --> 00:28:39.524
From this day on,

253
00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:42.090
now and forever,

254
00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:46.191
you will bring our gifts
to all the children...


255
00:28:46.259 --> 00:28:48.890
In all the world.

256
00:28:48.959 --> 00:28:52.324
<i>And all this</i>
<i>to be done...</i>


257
00:28:52.392 --> 00:28:54.457
<i>On Christmas Eve.</i>

258
00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:58.424
How can I do so much
in just one night?


259
00:28:58.492 --> 00:29:01.457
Oh, yes.

260
00:29:04.592 --> 00:29:07.191
Time travels with you;

261
00:29:07.259 --> 00:29:12.157
that the night of the world
is a passage...


262
00:29:12.226 --> 00:29:15.724
Of endless night
for you.


263
00:29:15.792 --> 00:29:19.924
Mm. Until
your mission is done.


264
00:29:19.992 --> 00:29:25.090
This is your legacy,
and your gift,


265
00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:28.524
as is the gift
of flight.


266
00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:34.390
Mm-hmm. Now.

267
00:29:34.459 --> 00:29:38.041
All those within
the sound of my voice,


268
00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:42.041
and all those on this
earth everywhere know...


269
00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:45.374
That henceforth,

270
00:29:45.443 --> 00:29:47.974
you will be called...

271
00:29:48.043 --> 00:29:50.041
Santa claus.

272
00:29:50.109 --> 00:29:51.974
Santa?

273
00:29:52.043 --> 00:29:56.874
<i>And now, everyone,</i>

274
00:29:56.943 --> 00:30:01.074
- <i>merry Christmas!</i>
- -Merry Christmas!


275
00:30:05.209 --> 00:30:07.641
Merry Christmas. Yes.

276
00:30:53.109 --> 00:30:55.541
Come on.
Good boy.


277
00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:34.923
Yo!

278
00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:40.957
Faster! Faster!

279
00:31:41.025 --> 00:31:46.224
Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!

280
00:31:48.792 --> 00:31:50.790
Come on, boys.
Come on!


281
00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:53.324
<i>Come on. Don't be afraid.
Come on.</i>


282
00:31:54.826 --> 00:31:57.857
This is it!
Come on!


283
00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:03.124
Ho, ho, ho! Feel the wind
in your faces, boys.


284
00:32:22.825 --> 00:32:24.756
<i>Oh, come on, donner.</i>

285
00:32:24.825 --> 00:32:27.557
There's nothing to worry about.
It's only flying.


286
00:32:29.859 --> 00:32:32.124
"Only flying"?
What am I saying?


287
00:32:32.193 --> 00:32:34.491
<i>All right, boys.</i>
<i>Bank to the right.</i>


288
00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:38.374
Steady!
That's the way!


289
00:33:06.176 --> 00:33:08.475
Come on, boys.
That's my good boys.


290
00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:34.873
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

291
00:33:37.393 --> 00:33:41.523
Oh, more and more are learning to
write now, asking for what they want.


292
00:33:41.592 --> 00:33:43.690
<i>Reading and writing,</i>
<i>writing and reading.</i>


293
00:34:06.008 --> 00:34:10.207
<i>Leave him alone! Don't!</i>
<i>Can't you see he hates it?</i>


294
00:34:10.276 --> 00:34:12.307
Let go! Leave him alone! Don't!

295
00:34:12.376 --> 00:34:14.307
Leave him be!
You're hurting him.


296
00:34:14.775 --> 00:34:16.490
Oh, l-let go!

297
00:34:16.559 --> 00:34:19.907
<i>Come back, you stupid animal!</i>

298
00:34:19.976 --> 00:34:21.974
<i>Come back!</i>

299
00:35:07.293 --> 00:35:10.556
"I am sure he hurts
the poor little kitten,


300
00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:14.424
"and when I cry,
he just laughs at me.


301
00:35:14.492 --> 00:35:17.523
Yours sincerely,
miss Sarah foster."


302
00:35:17.592 --> 00:35:20.124
You were quite right to bring
this to our attention, dooley.


303
00:35:20.193 --> 00:35:22.391
That little boy
must not get a present.


304
00:35:22.459 --> 00:35:25.157
No present for him? Every
child should get a present.


305
00:35:25.226 --> 00:35:28.523
It's time

the super-dooper looper.


455
00:51:38.108 --> 00:51:40.806
- <i>What's that?</i>
- I've been trying for years.


456
00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:43.773
Well, maybe tonight's
the night!


457
00:51:43.841 --> 00:51:47.705
Come on, donner. Let's give
it that old college try!


458
00:51:50.775 --> 00:51:55.423
-<i>Come on, donner! This may be it! This may be it!</i>
- Ohh, yahoo!


459
00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:59.123
<i>You can do it, donner!</i>
<i>Come on, boy!</i>


460
00:51:59.192 --> 00:52:01.972
- Here we go!
- Ohh--


461
00:52:02.175 --> 00:52:05.023
you can do it, boy!
I know you can do it!


462
00:52:05.091 --> 00:52:08.323
- <i>Come on!</i>

463
00:52:12.641 --> 00:52:15.773
- <i>Ohh!</i>
- Ohh.


464
00:52:18.025 --> 00:52:21.555
Boy, well,
didn't work again.


465
00:52:21.624 --> 00:52:23.756
That's all right,
donner boy.


466
00:52:23.824 --> 00:52:26.323
<i>We'll get it next time.</i>

467
00:52:26.391 --> 00:52:30.655
Tell 'em it's all right.
Uh, hey, like,


468
00:52:30.724 --> 00:52:32.655
<i>don't sweat it!</i>

469
00:52:32.724 --> 00:52:36.023
<i>You did your best,</i>
<i>you know?</i>


470
00:52:42.858 --> 00:52:45.689
Hey, how would you like
to drive for a while?


471
00:52:45.758 --> 00:52:48.455
Me? Drive?
Sure!


472
00:52:48.524 --> 00:52:51.622
It's easy.
Here! Take the reins.


473
00:52:55.858 --> 00:52:58.923
Well, come on.
Whoa!


474
00:52:58.992 --> 00:53:02.023
<i>Wa-hoo-hoo!</i>

475
00:53:02.092 --> 00:53:04.156
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

476
00:53:04.225 --> 00:53:06.756
How am I doin'?
Oh, great.


477
00:53:10.192 --> 00:53:13.190
- Ohh!
- <i>Come on, guys, go!</i>


478
00:53:13.259 --> 00:53:15.773
Oh, no. No! Hey, wait a minute!
Come on, guys. Go!


479
00:53:15.841 --> 00:53:18.039
Wait a minute! Oh!
Oh! Go, go, go!


480
00:53:18.108 --> 00:53:20.306
Watch out! Oh!
Wait a minute!


481
00:53:22.308 --> 00:53:24.605
Wait a second.
Oh, oh, my!


482
00:53:24.674 --> 00:53:26.806
What do you call them?

483
00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:29.505
Reindeer. No, I mean,
what's their names?


484
00:53:29.574 --> 00:53:31.572
Oh.
Startin' from the front,


485
00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:33.939
<i>that's</i>
<i>donner and blitzen.</i>


486
00:53:34.008 --> 00:53:37.123
<i>Comet and cupid,</i>
<i>prancer and dancer,</i>


487
00:53:37.191 --> 00:53:40.623
<i>then dasher and ViXen. Look.
There's the Brooklyn bridge.</i>


488
00:53:40.691 --> 00:53:43.322
Here we go! Come on, donner.
Come on!


489
00:53:43.391 --> 00:53:47.589
- <i>Oh-h-h-h!</i>
<i>- Whoo! Whoo, whoo!</i>


490
00:53:47.892 --> 00:53:49.539
Go, go!

491
00:53:52.474 --> 00:53:55.123
<i>Let's go get it!</i>
<i>Come on, donner!</i>


492
00:53:55.424 --> 00:53:57.705
<i>Come on, blitzen!</i>
<i>Go, guys, go, go!</i>


493
00:53:57.775 --> 00:54:01.538
<i>- Come on, donner.</i>
<i>- You can do it.</i>


494
00:54:01.607 --> 00:54:03.439
<i>Come on, go, go!</i>

495
00:54:03.641 --> 00:54:06.156
Oh, boy.

496
00:54:15.558 --> 00:54:17.240
I better
take 'em now, Joe.


497
00:54:17.307 --> 00:54:20.939
Where are we going? Well,
we can't joyride all night.


498
00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:23.839
I've got a job
to do, you know?


499
00:54:23.908 --> 00:54:27.006
Oh, yeah!

500
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:38.455
Is this the kid
who lives here?


501
00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:40.990
Yep.
What'd he get?


502
00:54:41.058 --> 00:54:42.990
Fishing rod.
How come?


503
00:54:43.058 --> 00:54:46.322
That's what he asked for
in his letter.


504
00:54:46.391 --> 00:54:48.723
You mean, if a kid writes--

505
00:54:48.791 --> 00:54:53.140
- anything he wants? - Joe, didn't
you ever write me a letter?


506
00:54:53.208 --> 00:54:56.256
I never believed in--

507
00:54:56.324 --> 00:54:59.589
I mean, hey, I never
needed nothin'.


508
00:54:59.657 --> 00:55:02.472
- See, I usually travel light.
- Well--


509
00:55:03.841 --> 00:55:05.839
let's travel now.

510
00:55:32.391 --> 00:55:34.956
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't see it.


511
00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:49.672
Are you him?

512
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:51.672
<i>Are you Santa claus?</i>

513
00:55:51.741 --> 00:55:55.338
Boy, I hate it
when this happens.


514
00:55:55.407 --> 00:55:58.106
- Hello, little girl.
- Is this my doll?


515
00:55:58.307 --> 00:56:00.639
Mmm.

516
00:56:00.707 --> 00:56:04.890
- What are<i>you</i> doing here?
- You two know each other.


517
00:56:04.958 --> 00:56:07.622
Oh, sort of.

518
00:56:10.191 --> 00:56:13.422
I'm Cornelia.
I'm Joe.


519
00:56:13.491 --> 00:56:18.972
- I'm Santa claus. - Oh, it's a
great pleasure to meet you, sir.


520
00:56:19.174 --> 00:56:23.155
Would you like some cookies?
They're from bloomingdale's.


521
00:56:23.224 --> 00:56:25.856
Oh.

522
00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:30.322
Chocolate chip.
They're my favorite.


523
00:56:30.391 --> 00:56:33.389
Listen, corny. Thanks for all
the good food you gave me.


524
00:56:33.457 --> 00:56:35.455
I can make you
a bowl of ice cream.


525
00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:39.188
<i>I tell you what, Joe. You stay
here and have something to eat.</i>


526
00:56:39.257 --> 00:56:42.556
- I'll see you again.
- You will? You mean it?


527
00:56:42.625 --> 00:56:45.723
Santa claus
doesn't lie, Joe.


528
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:49.455
- Next Christmas Eve, we got a date, okay?
- You bet!


529
00:56:49.525 --> 00:56:51.623
Thanks for the cookies.

530
00:56:57.941 --> 00:56:59.805
What a guy.

531
00:57:00.141 --> 00:57:02.389
Excellent.

532
00:57:02.457 --> 00:57:06.073
Come on, now. It's easy.
There you go.


533
00:57:09.675 --> 00:57:13.255
You're doing fine.
Thanks, daddy.


534
00:57:13.324 --> 00:57:17.606
<i>That's it. Oh!</i>

535
00:57:17.674 --> 00:57:20.606
Sweetie pie!

536
00:57:30.875 --> 00:57:35.155
Mom!

537
00:57:35.358 --> 00:57:38.789
- He's a great guy!
- His toys are cheap crap!


538
00:57:38.858 --> 00:57:42.088
His presents suck! What do you care?
Nobody ever gave you nothin'!


539
00:57:42.391 --> 00:57:44.806
How can you be so dumb?

540
00:57:44.875 --> 00:57:47.238
Everyone knows he gives out
shoddy, cheap toys.


541
00:57:47.307 --> 00:57:49.556
My daddy says
he's an old fake.


542
00:57:49.624 --> 00:57:52.756
He is not. He's the nicest
man in the whole world.


543
00:57:52.825 --> 00:57:57.088
My parents gave me a doll, and she
says whole sentences on a cassette.


544
00:57:57.157 --> 00:57:59.922
You don't have any
parents, so naaah! Ow!


545
00:57:59.991 --> 00:58:05.039
- A fight! - Girls! No way
can dancers be angry.


546
00:58:21.174 --> 00:58:23.405
<i>Returns are coming back</i>
<i>from everywhere.</i>


547
00:58:23.474 --> 00:58:26.205
<i>Returns? We've</i>
<i>never had returns.</i>


548
00:58:26.274 --> 00:58:30.139
Maybe we could put out
some kind of statement.


549
00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:32.372
<i>Hi.</i>

550
00:58:35.974 --> 00:58:39.272
Well, I've got
a lot to do.


551
00:58:47.874 --> 00:58:49.839
The thing--

552
00:58:49.907 --> 00:58:52.839
I never was--
you see, I wanted-


553
00:58:52.907 --> 00:58:55.905
being tied down to a desk
suits some elves, you know,


554
00:58:55.974 --> 00:58:59.905
but others of us
are more free-spirited.


555
00:58:59.974 --> 00:59:02.972
I know you had no idea.
I know that.


556
00:59:10.641 --> 00:59:12.672
Patch, how can I say this?

557
00:59:12.741 --> 00:59:17.839
<i>Yeah, I think that,</i>
<i>um... red--</i>


558
00:59:18.307 --> 00:59:22.222
red just, just isn't
my color, you know?


559
00:59:31.707 --> 00:59:35.055
Congratulations!

560
00:59:43.892 --> 00:59:47.756
He'll never have an assistant
as good as me.


561
00:59:47.824 --> 00:59:52.322
Let's face it,
he just doesn't like me.


562
00:59:56.124 --> 01:00:00.705
<i>Well, boys, I'm gonna miss you.</i>
<i>You know that, don't you?</i>


563
01:00:22.258 --> 01:00:24.639
Take care of yourself, huh?

564
01:01:13.658 --> 01:01:18.122
Now, sir, I'm asking you if this toy
here was manufactured by your company,


565
01:01:18.191 --> 01:01:21.222
<i>the b.Z. Toy manufacturing</i>
<i>corporation.</i>


566
01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:24.488
Um, yes, senator,
this doll appears to be...


567
01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:28.289
One of our own Betty beauties.

568
01:01:33.658 --> 01:01:36.954
Holy crap!
My goodness!


569
01:01:42.808 --> 01:01:45.172
Well, what do you say
to that, sir?


570
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.739
Well, senator, I've always
known that cigarette smoking...


571
01:01:47.808 --> 01:01:51.039
Could be hazardous
to your health.


572
01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:53.972
This is not a laughing matter, sir.
This is a tragedy!


573
01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:56.439
You, sir, are a disgrace
to your profession.


574
01:01:56.507 --> 01:01:58.972
Um, senator,
with all due respect--


575
01:01:59.041 --> 01:02:04.789
and, I believe, this toy is advertised
as being suitable for three-year-olds.


576
01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:11.805
Oh, my goodness!

577
01:02:11.873 --> 01:02:16.705
Um, senator, I'm even
more astonished...


578
01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:21.355
Than you are to see this, and I can guarantee
that if these are not isolated examples,


579
01:02:21.424 --> 01:02:25.022
I'll make sure that
they never happen again.


580
01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:27.172
<i>Well, you better do</i>
<i>more than that, sir.</i>


581
01:02:27.241 --> 01:02:29.572
You better withdraw
every b.Z. Toy on the market,


582
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:34.505
<i>or I'll personally see to it that your license
to manufacture in the United States is revoked.</i>


583
01:02:34.941 --> 01:02:38.673
No comment!

584
01:02:38.741 --> 01:02:41.573
Okay, towser,
give it to me straight.


585
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:45.972
The retail outfits are pulling our
toys off the shelves. Cowards!


586
01:02:46.041 --> 01:02:49.573
The<i>post</i> said that anyone who gives his kid
a b.Z. Toy should have his head examined.


587
01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:52.573
Swine!

588
01:02:52.641 --> 01:02:56.573
We've got to meet a payroll by the end
of the month for 2,000 factory workers.


589
01:02:56.641 --> 01:02:59.573
Commies! And our cash flow
is flowing the wrong way.


590
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:02.755
Right down the toilet. You sure
know how to cheer a guy up.


591
01:03:02.823 --> 01:03:04.922
What'll we do, b.Z.?

592
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:09.205
Patch gone? Where will he go?
What will he do?


593
01:03:10.474 --> 01:03:12.905
The world is no place
for an elf.


594
01:03:12.974 --> 01:03:15.572
The world's a nice enough
place, isn't it?


595
01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:19.139
I mean, they send such nice
letters from there. It must be.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.738
Good morning, Mr. grizzard.
Everything okay?


603
01:03:53.807 --> 01:03:55.938
Fine.

604
01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:13.072
Greetings. Who the
hell-- miss abruzzi!


605
01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:16.272
Don't bother with that. I'll just vanish.
You'll what?


606
01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.472
Vanish... like this.

607
01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.538
Hello?

608
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.505
Hi.
Wha--


609
01:04:25.574 --> 01:04:28.805
it's a bit uncomfortable
in here. Oh!


610
01:04:33.641 --> 01:04:37.139
Over here!

611
01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:40.038
How did you do that?

612
01:04:40.107 --> 01:04:42.639
Listen.
You make toys, right?


613
01:04:42.706 --> 01:04:46.105
Are you, uh... from the
federal trade commission?


614
01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:48.372
No. I'm
from the north pole.


615
01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.072
I've got enough on my mind without
having to deal with an escaped lunatic!


616
01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:54.905
How do you know I escaped?
What are you?


617
01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.505
Isn't it elf-explanatory?
How's that?


618
01:04:57.574 --> 01:04:59.505
I'm an elf.
An elf?


619
01:04:59.574 --> 01:05:01.772
Yes.
You mean, like a fairy?


620
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.338
No, I'm not a fairy.
I'm an elf.


621
01:05:04.407 --> 01:05:06.972
But-but... why are you here?

622
01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.838
Well, I gather
you're a great toy giver.


623
01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:12.972
I'm a great toy maker. We should get
together. Why should I do that?


624
01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.638
Heaven helps those
who help their elf.


625
01:05:16.706 --> 01:05:19.638
But-but-but why me?
Because I want to help you.


626
01:05:19.706 --> 01:05:23.704
Why? So Santa claus
will appreciate me.


627
01:05:23.774 --> 01:05:26.972
I was right.
You are a lunatic.


628
01:05:28.307 --> 01:05:30.805
Don't you believe
in Santa claus?


629
01:05:30.874 --> 01:05:34.772
Why should I? He never
brought me anything.


630
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.838
That's because you were
probably a naughty boy.


631
01:05:38.907 --> 01:05:43.538
Yes... I guess
I was no angel.


632
01:05:47.606 --> 01:05:50.938
Well, what did you
have in mind, elf?


633
01:05:51.007 --> 01:05:54.572
Just let me use your toy factory.
To make what?


634
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.738
Something special. Now,
here's the idea. Mm-hmm.


635
01:05:57.807 --> 01:06:01.738
First of all, you stop making
all your regular toys.


636
01:06:01.807 --> 01:06:04.838
Well, I'm sure they're
fine and dandy, dandy and fine.


637
01:06:04.907 --> 01:06:07.005
But we won't
be needing them anymore.


638
01:06:07.074 --> 01:06:09.538
Won't... be...
Needing them anymore?


639
01:06:09.606 --> 01:06:12.105
No. Oh, uh,
tell me something.


640
01:06:12.174 --> 01:06:15.239
How can I tell all the people
about my something special?


641
01:06:15.307 --> 01:06:18.338
Advertise. Advertise?
How do I do that?


642
01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:21.505
In my line,
television works best.


643
01:06:21.573 --> 01:06:26.239
Oh, I know! Those little picture
box thingies? Can we get on those?


644
01:06:26.307 --> 01:06:29.905
With enough money, a horse in a
hoop skirt can get on one of those.


645
01:06:29.973 --> 01:06:32.638
Money. I don't know
much about that.


646
01:06:32.707 --> 01:06:35.539
Good.
Oh.


647
01:06:35.607 --> 01:06:38.422
Let's, um, keep it
that way, huh?


648
01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:41.755
Okay, but you'll fix it so I can
get on the telly? Yeah. When?


649
01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:43.855
Christmas Eve.
How long?


650
01:06:43.923 --> 01:06:45.888
Is a minute all right?
What channel?


651
01:06:45.957 --> 01:06:48.688
- Well, all of them.
- Which countries?


652
01:06:48.757 --> 01:06:51.721
<i>All of them. All the countries,</i>
<i>all the channels.</i>


653
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:54.489
That would cost
a fortune!


654
01:06:56.324 --> 01:07:00.222
If you give extra kisses,
you get bigger hugs.


655
01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:04.088
- Sorry? - That's what Santa's
wife is always saying.


656
01:07:04.158 --> 01:07:06.921
<i>Anyway...</i>

657
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:10.088
That's all the advertising
you'll ever need.


658
01:07:10.158 --> 01:07:14.555
It better be. How many workers does this...
product require?


659
01:07:14.624 --> 01:07:17.289
Just me.
Wha-- no payroll?


660
01:07:17.358 --> 01:07:21.289
A bowl of stew, heavy on the
dill, a cold place to sleep.


661
01:07:21.358 --> 01:07:23.655
What would it cost?
Cost? Cost who?


662
01:07:23.723 --> 01:07:25.655
The people
who buy the toy.


663
01:07:25.723 --> 01:07:28.622
Well, nothing. We're going
to give them away free.


664
01:07:32.224 --> 01:07:36.555
Oh, that's fantastic! How do you
turn your face so red so fast?


665
01:07:36.624 --> 01:07:39.855
- For free? - Well, that's how
we do it at the north pole.


666
01:07:40.158 --> 01:07:42.171
Well, that's not
how we do it here!


667
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.972
<i>In a free enterprise</i>
<i>system--</i>


668
01:07:46.606 --> 01:07:50.139
on the other hand,
this would go a long way...


669
01:07:50.207 --> 01:07:53.072
Towards cleaning up
my public image.


670
01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:56.504
Excuse me? That's not
a bad investment.


671
01:07:56.573 --> 01:08:00.438
All that good p.R.

672
01:08:02.241 --> 01:08:05.537
I'm intrigued. Excuse me.
You're drooling on your tie.


673
01:08:05.606 --> 01:08:08.239
Yes, I know. I said I was
intrigued, didn't I?


674
01:08:08.307 --> 01:08:14.072
Now listen, son, what experience
do you have in toy manufacture?


675
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:18.205
Come on. I'm entirely
elf-taught.


676
01:08:18.274 --> 01:08:21.338
Uh-huh.
What about it, b.Z.


677
01:08:21.407 --> 01:08:23.704
This product of yours--

678
01:08:23.774 --> 01:08:27.239
this, uh,
something special--


679
01:08:27.307 --> 01:08:29.972
what exactly is it?

680
01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:34.405
It's something that's very
easy to make. Uh-huh.


681
01:08:34.473 --> 01:08:36.571
It's cheap.
Uh-huh.


682
01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.571
It's simple.
Uh-huh.


683
01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.072
You can turn them out by
the thousands. Uh-huh.


684
01:08:41.141 --> 01:08:44.704
And--
yes. And?


685
01:08:44.774 --> 01:08:47.437
It's got a secret
ingredient.


686
01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.289
Look around you!
No strikes, no smelly workers!


687
01:08:55.358 --> 01:08:58.289
No payroll!
It's practically paradise!


688
01:08:58.358 --> 01:09:01.421
Still, giving this toy away
for free-- that, Dr. towser,


689
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:05.955
is why I am a captain of industry and
you are an insignificant schlepper.


690
01:09:06.024 --> 01:09:08.522
Sure, the first Christmas,
it's free.


691
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:11.488
But the next one, we say,
"so you want it again?


692
01:09:11.557 --> 01:09:14.488
Bigger? Better? Well, this
time it's gonna cost you!"


693
01:09:14.557 --> 01:09:17.256
How much? I don't know.
One hundred, two hundred.


694
01:09:17.324 --> 01:09:21.256
Where will they get that kind of money?
What do I care?


695
01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:25.721
Ahh, it's a wonderful thing,
cracking your knuckles.


696
01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:29.855
It's the pleasantest sound in the world.
What's he building in there?


697
01:09:30.158 --> 01:09:33.971
<i>I'm not sure. He says</i>
<i>it's the delivery system.</i>


698
01:09:36.757 --> 01:09:40.022
Yes? We brought the
prototypes for, uh... it.


699
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.922
Let me see them.
Towser. Towser!


700
01:09:43.991 --> 01:09:47.822
<i>That one.</i>

701
01:09:47.891 --> 01:09:50.688
What color? What
color do you like?


702
01:09:50.757 --> 01:09:52.788
I like puce.
You would!


703
01:09:52.857 --> 01:09:55.255
What's puce?
It's like fuchsia,


704
01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.454
but a shade less lavender
and a bit more pink.


705
01:09:57.524 --> 01:09:59.588
Sometimes
I wonder about you.


706
01:09:59.657 --> 01:10:03.022
Fine. Puce, then. As long as it
tastes good. But are you gonna--


707
01:10:05.473 --> 01:10:08.905
if this catches on, we can come
out with a liquid version.


708
01:10:08.973 --> 01:10:12.038
Puce juice.

709
01:10:20.774 --> 01:10:23.405
Oh, my!
An elf-portrait.


710
01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:25.571
You haven't made
one of those since--


711
01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.838
it's for Joe. He never
got a present in his life,


712
01:10:29.907 --> 01:10:32.071
and he's too proud
to ask for one.


713
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.171
Mm-hmm.

714
01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.005
He makes me think what our son
might've been like, Anya.


715
01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:47.438
Why, it's patch!

716
01:10:47.507 --> 01:10:50.337
It's not patch--

717
01:10:50.407 --> 01:10:53.105
well, I guess it does
resemble--


718
01:10:56.473 --> 01:10:59.005
my good old patch.

719
01:10:59.073 --> 01:11:03.255
I don't know about this. It isn't what
the north pole looks like at all.


720
01:11:03.323 --> 01:11:06.521
Look, b.Z. Knows what he's doing.
He knows how to grab the people.


721
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:09.888
This isn't real. The public doesn't
want reality. They want the dream.


722
01:11:09.957 --> 01:11:13.921

<i>Give it all you got, kid!</i>


749
01:14:17.857 --> 01:14:20.688
Yaaaaa-hoo!

750
01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:23.888
Oh! Oh.

751
01:14:56.507 --> 01:14:58.871
Santa!

752
01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.505
At least somebody
down there likes me.


753
01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:14.838
Easy, boys.
Easy, now.


754
01:15:14.907 --> 01:15:16.905
<i>Easy, boys.</i>

755
01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.605
Whoa!

756
01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.438
- Hello, Joe.
- Hey, how's it goin'?


757
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:33.605
Not bad.
Yourself?


758
01:15:35.106 --> 01:15:39.972
I'm okay, I guess. I was afraid
you'd forget about me.


759
01:15:46.807 --> 01:15:49.738
Well...

760
01:15:49.807 --> 01:15:53.054
At least I've got
one good friend left.


761
01:15:53.122 --> 01:15:57.505
Are you kidding? I'm your
pal for life! Honest!


762
01:15:57.574 --> 01:16:01.271
<i>Oh, hey, there was this weird
guy on television. Some patch--</i>


763
01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:04.221
I know about that.
That's all right.


764
01:16:04.289 --> 01:16:06.855
Then it's cool, then?
Yeah.


765
01:16:06.923 --> 01:16:10.054
Hiya, blitzen. Hey, donner,
how's it goin', man?


766
01:16:12.273 --> 01:16:17.454
- Hey, comet!

767
01:16:17.757 --> 01:16:20.755
- All right.
- Coming?


768
01:16:20.824 --> 01:16:24.020
Neat!

769
01:16:25.423 --> 01:16:28.254
Oh! I almost forgot.

770
01:16:35.056 --> 01:16:38.238
- For me?
- For you.


771
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.805
A present?

772
01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:48.271
Aw, gee, thanks!
Excellent!


773
01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:52.488
Did corny get something?
The, um, little girl.


774
01:16:52.557 --> 01:16:56.405
Oh! Are you seeing
a lot of each other?


775
01:16:56.473 --> 01:16:59.871
Actually, yes. Actually.

776
01:17:00.307 --> 01:17:03.171
Well, of course she's gonna get a present.
She writes a nice letter.


777
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.971
She asked for a toy piano.

778
01:17:07.407 --> 01:17:11.104
Well, come on.
Huh?


779
01:17:11.173 --> 01:17:14.604
What about the, uh, "yo"?

780
01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:17.321
Oh, right. Yo!

781
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:19.854
All right, donner!
All right, blitzen!


782
01:17:19.922 --> 01:17:21.953
All right, everybody!
Ho-ho-ho!


783
01:17:22.022 --> 01:17:25.054
Here we go! Ha-ha-ha!

784
01:17:25.122 --> 01:17:27.555
Ho-ho-ho!

785
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:38.505
Don't you want to try it?

786
01:17:38.573 --> 01:17:40.672
I certainly do not.

787
01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:44.970
Well, it would be a shame
to let it go to waste.


788
01:17:45.039 --> 01:17:48.288
Do you mind if I take it?
I don't care.


789
01:17:48.356 --> 01:17:51.721
Mmm!

790
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:54.388
Mmm!

791
01:17:54.456 --> 01:17:57.454
Ohhh!

792
01:17:57.523 --> 01:18:01.655
<i>Oh, look at me!</i>
<i>I feel just like Mary poppins!</i>


793
01:18:05.657 --> 01:18:08.288
<i>Okay, man, come on.</i>
<i>Do your worst, huh?</i>


794
01:18:08.356 --> 01:18:11.721
<i>Come on. You can't get past me,</i>
<i>sucker. Come on! Come on!</i>


795
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:14.004
Oh, yeah,
you can't get past me.


796
01:18:14.072 --> 01:18:17.305
<i>Kid, come on, give me that ball!
Hey, what you doin'?</i>


797
01:18:17.373 --> 01:18:19.187
Hey!

798
01:18:19.256 --> 01:18:22.788
Wow! I don't believe it!

799
01:18:23.089 --> 01:18:26.305
You're cute.

800
01:18:44.723 --> 01:18:47.971
Here he is,
ladies and gentlemen.


801
01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.887
The man of the hour.
Ask him anything.


802
01:18:49.956 --> 01:18:52.604
Tell us how you make it.
Can you, please?


803
01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.655
What's in the lollipops,
Mr. patch?


804
01:18:54.723 --> 01:18:57.870
Well, it's--
all natural ingredients.


805
01:18:57.939 --> 01:19:01.438
- No additives whatsoever.
- Who did your outfit?


806
01:19:01.506 --> 01:19:04.870
Uh, goober, actually. He's
head of the sewing department.


807
01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.405
Mr. patch, has the space
agency contacted you yet?


808
01:19:07.473 --> 01:19:09.921
Who?
<i>The astronauts.</i>


809
01:19:09.989 --> 01:19:12.938
Oh. No, they'll have
to write to Santa claus...


810
01:19:13.006 --> 01:19:15.271
<i>Just like the other</i>
<i>boys and girls.</i>


811
01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:18.504
Uh, what we want--
what we want...


812
01:19:18.573 --> 01:19:21.870
Is to bring joy
and happiness...


813
01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:24.920
To all the little children
of this world.


814
01:19:24.989 --> 01:19:27.588
And that's why
I'm proud to announce...


815
01:19:27.657 --> 01:19:31.704
That, beginning today,
my pal patch here...


816
01:19:31.772 --> 01:19:34.555
Is exclusive with b.Z. Toys!

817
01:19:34.623 --> 01:19:38.054
What about the fact that the senate
subcommittee on toy safety...


818
01:19:38.122 --> 01:19:41.820
Cited this company
with 15 separate--


819
01:19:41.889 --> 01:19:44.488
no more questions!

820
01:19:44.557 --> 01:19:46.870
No more questions.
No more questions.


821
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.704
What's this about the senate subcommittee?
Just typical newspaper garbage.


822
01:19:49.772 --> 01:19:53.271
Don't take it seriously. And what was
that business about our future plans?


823
01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.204
The future is ours, patch.

824
01:19:56.273 --> 01:19:59.604
But I'm going back to the north pole.
Says who?


825
01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.388
Well, nobody yet. But now Santa
claus has seen what I can do.


826
01:20:03.456 --> 01:20:05.688
I'm sure he's gonna send
for me to come home.


827
01:20:05.755 --> 01:20:09.887
Why would you want to do that? What does
the north pole have that New York doesn't?


828
01:20:09.955 --> 01:20:12.787
Ice and polar bears--

829
01:20:13.223 --> 01:20:15.870
and Santa claus
and my friends.


830
01:20:16.307 --> 01:20:19.038
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what.


831
01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:22.737
Just do me one favor
before you go.


832
01:20:22.806 --> 01:20:26.187
- No, I can't. I've gotta go back.
- No, no, no, no.


833
01:20:26.256 --> 01:20:30.021
Not for me.
For them, patch.


834
01:20:31.823 --> 01:20:34.871
- Well, who?
- Am I right?


835
01:20:36.273 --> 01:20:39.204
Something...

836
01:20:39.273 --> 01:20:42.604
Something for them.

837
01:20:42.673 --> 01:20:45.337
Something
for all the children...


838
01:20:45.406 --> 01:20:48.871
Of this miserable old world.

839
01:20:51.073 --> 01:20:54.071
So how about it?
Will you do it?


840
01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:58.437
What is it? This stardust--
this reindeer cornflakes--


841
01:20:58.506 --> 01:21:01.571
whatever it is that made
the children walk on air--


842
01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.571
wh-wh-what would happen if you were
to juice up the formula a bit?


843
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.571
Just make it stronger?

844
01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.871
Well, it's elf-explanatory.
I mean, it would make them fly.


845
01:21:10.939 --> 01:21:13.937
Yeah, fly.
Fly? Fly? Fly?


846
01:21:14.006 --> 01:21:18.904
You mean, like, fly?
Like fly high in the sky.


847
01:21:18.973 --> 01:21:23.004
And could you do that before you go?
Yes, but I--


848
01:21:23.073 --> 01:21:27.004
patch. It wouldn't
take you long, would it?


849
01:21:27.073 --> 01:21:29.737
Lollipops?
No, no!


850
01:21:29.806 --> 01:21:32.837
No, we did that already.
That's yesterday's news.


851
01:21:32.906 --> 01:21:35.437
The consumer needs
a new model.


852
01:21:35.506 --> 01:21:38.871
Well... candy canes?

853
01:21:40.273 --> 01:21:43.204
Candy canes.
Mm-hmm.


854
01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:47.605
Of course. Patch!
You are some terrific elf!


855
01:21:47.672 --> 01:21:51.637
I mean, I could convert the--
I could convert the machines...


856
01:21:51.705 --> 01:21:54.188
To do candy canes, and in a week
or two, and then I suppose--


857
01:21:54.257 --> 01:21:57.571
<i>we can launch the ad campaign tomorrow.
Strike while the iron is hot!</i>


858
01:21:57.639 --> 01:22:00.921
I can promise delivery
in, say, three months.


859
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:03.088
Three months?
But it's a year to Christmas.


860
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:05.404
When you've got a hit
like we have, patch,


861
01:22:05.473 --> 01:22:09.803
the people don't want to wait a whole
year; They're dying for a sequel!


862
01:22:09.872 --> 01:22:13.471
A sequel.
That's it.


863
01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.371
We'll bring it out
on march 25,


864
01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.870
and we'll call it...

865
01:22:21.705 --> 01:22:24.171
Christmas ii!

866
01:22:25.423 --> 01:22:27.355
Christmas ii?

867
01:22:27.423 --> 01:22:31.054
Maybe the whole idea
is no good anymore.


868
01:22:31.123 --> 01:22:34.954
What are you talking about?
What idea?


869
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:39.587
Christmas.

870
01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:42.255
Claus!

871
01:22:44.323 --> 01:22:47.954
The world is a different
place now, Anya.


872
01:22:48.023 --> 01:22:50.388
You don't see it.

873
01:22:50.456 --> 01:22:53.454
The people
don't seem to care...


874
01:22:53.523 --> 01:22:56.787
About giving a gift...

875
01:22:56.856 --> 01:23:01.787
Just so they can see the light
of happiness in a friend's eyes.


876
01:23:01.856 --> 01:23:03.954
<i>Just--</i>

877
01:23:04.023 --> 01:23:07.787
<i>just doesn't feel</i>
<i>like Christmas anymore.</i>


878
01:23:10.456 --> 01:23:16.321
Maybe this fellow b.Z.
Is smarter than I am.


879
01:23:18.923 --> 01:23:20.921
Maybe I'm--

880
01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:26.421
maybe I'm just
an old fool.


881
01:24:06.672 --> 01:24:08.871
<i>Hi.</i>

882
01:24:08.939 --> 01:24:11.837
<i>Hi. Come up, quick.</i>

883
01:25:07.956 --> 01:25:10.888
You're burning up!
I'll be all right.


884
01:25:10.956 --> 01:25:14.355
You stay out there, and you'll
be dead is what you'll be.


885
01:25:15.856 --> 01:25:18.255
You're staying here!

886
01:25:18.323 --> 01:25:21.653
I'm what? There's an empty
room in the basement.


887
01:25:21.722 --> 01:25:24.388
Nobody ever goes down there.

888
01:25:26.290 --> 01:25:29.388
Oh, please, Joe.
Just till you get better.


889
01:25:30.856 --> 01:25:34.587
Well... all right.

890
01:25:34.655 --> 01:25:37.520
But just till I shake this.

891
01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:04.553
It's, uh, a new doll.

892
01:26:07.156 --> 01:26:09.587
A doll.

893
01:26:09.655 --> 01:26:12.921
Children ought to like it.

894
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:15.754
Does it fly?

895
01:26:15.822 --> 01:26:19.888
It, uh... wets.

896
01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:52.188
Towser! Good lord, man!

897
01:26:52.257 --> 01:26:55.653
Haven't you ever heard of the telephone?
I couldn't use the phone.


898
01:26:55.722 --> 01:27:00.420
It's perfectly easy, towser. You just pick up
the receiver and dial all the little numbers.


899
01:27:00.489 --> 01:27:02.587
I didn't dare
use the phone, b.Z.


900
01:27:02.655 --> 01:27:05.587
I couldn't take the chance of
anyone hearing. Hearing what?


901
01:27:05.655 --> 01:27:07.754
Shhh!
Hearing what?


902
01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:11.787
Are we alone? My niece and
her nanny are fast asleep.


903
01:27:11.856 --> 01:27:14.954
All right. Good.
Come on. Come on.


904
01:27:15.023 --> 01:27:17.021
Here.

905
01:27:21.923 --> 01:27:24.954
Ninety-nine.
You still have a temperature.


906
01:27:25.023 --> 01:27:27.888
Four dopey points!
Big deal!


907
01:27:27.956 --> 01:27:31.088
More liquids. That's what you need.
More vitamin c.


908
01:27:31.156 --> 01:27:34.037
Come on. Let's go get
some orange juice.


909
01:27:39.322 --> 01:27:43.888
<i>Oh, towser, with you it's</i>
<i>always some new melodrama.</i>


910
01:27:43.956 --> 01:27:48.070
<i>Well, let me tell you, my friend,
tonight, nothing can upset me.</i>


911
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:52.403
The money's coming in so fast, you'd
think we were printing it ourselves!


912
01:27:52.472 --> 01:27:54.587
But, but, b.Z.--

913
01:27:54.656 --> 01:27:57.254
do you realize
what this means, man?


914
01:27:57.322 --> 01:28:00.587
Santa claus is finished!

915
01:28:02.923 --> 01:28:06.570
<i>I'm taking over Christmas.</i>
<i>By next December,</i>


916
01:28:06.639 --> 01:28:09.138
they'll be writing to me!

917
01:28:09.206 --> 01:28:12.337
B.Z.

918
01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:22.037
What the hell--

919
01:28:24.905 --> 01:28:28.171
towser, take that way!
Oh! Oh!


920
01:28:33.539 --> 01:28:36.454
Come on with me, young man!
Let me go!


921
01:28:36.522 --> 01:28:41.121
<i>How did you get in here? Who
are you, anyway? Let me go!</i>


922
01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:46.571
<i>Towser! Towser!</i>

923
01:28:46.639 --> 01:28:49.571
- You little brat!
- Who is this kid?


924
01:28:49.639 --> 01:28:53.204
- Some damned little sneak!
- I heard what you said!


925
01:28:53.272 --> 01:28:55.904
<i>You ain't never gonna</i>
<i>beat Santa claus! Never!</i>


926
01:28:55.973 --> 01:28:59.937
<i>I'll tell him, and he'll beat
you!</i> Park this kid on ice!

927
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:04.304
I'll deal with him later.

928
01:29:13.156 --> 01:29:15.320
Shut up!

929
01:29:23.756 --> 01:29:25.571
B.Z., we've got to talk.

930
01:29:25.639 --> 01:29:29.404
Have you ever had one of those nights
when you just want to drop a bomb?


931
01:29:29.473 --> 01:29:32.870
Some damn kid in my basement, you waltzing
into the house in the middle of the night--


932
01:29:32.939 --> 01:29:35.671
by the way, towser, what the
hell did you want, anyway?


933
01:29:36.006 --> 01:29:39.187
It's the candy canes. They're dangerous.
What about 'em?


934
01:29:39.255 --> 01:29:42.105
What the hell are you talking about?
This patch guy--


935
01:29:42.172 --> 01:29:45.071
he told me he keeps that secret
ingredient in cold storage...


936
01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:48.105
<i>Because it comes from the north pole.</i> Uh-huh.

937
01:29:48.172 --> 01:29:50.220
So we started manufacturing
the candy canes. <i>Uh-huh.</i>


938
01:29:50.288 --> 01:29:52.687
- It's a very powerful mixture, you know?
- Uh-huh.


939
01:29:52.756 --> 01:29:56.721
<i>So I just assumed I should refrigerate
them too.</i> Get on with your story!


940
01:29:56.789 --> 01:30:00.354
<i>Stop giving me all these short sentences and
making me go "uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh"..</i>


941
01:30:00.422 --> 01:30:03.054
Like some kind of a moron!
<i>Uh-huh.</i>


942
01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:07.270
I had to move one of the batches of candy
canes to another part of the factory.


943
01:30:07.339 --> 01:30:09.571
<i>I left a box next</i>
<i>to a radiator in the lab.</i>


944
01:30:09.639 --> 01:30:12.404
- And?
- There's no more lab.


945
01:30:12.606 --> 01:30:15.403
<i>The candy canes</i>
<i>exploded!</i>


946
01:30:15.473 --> 01:30:18.370
<i>They react to extreme heat</i>
<i>and turn volatile.</i>


947
01:30:18.439 --> 01:30:22.471
<i>We've got to stop this.</i> Stop? 
Are you insane?

948
01:30:24.238 --> 01:30:27.871
<i>We've got millions of dollars pouring
in every day, most of it in cash.</i>


949
01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:33.671
<i>Cash, man!</i>
<i>Small, unmarked bills.</i>


950
01:30:33.739 --> 01:30:36.537
B.Z., this stuff
can kill people.


951
01:30:36.606 --> 01:30:39.270
Are you going soft on me?
No, I'm not going--


952
01:30:39.339 --> 01:30:42.487
listen, you idiot.
Who else knows about this?


953
01:30:42.556 --> 01:30:44.787
Nobody.
What about patch?


954
01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:47.754
He was asleep.
He didn't hear anything.


955
01:30:47.823 --> 01:30:50.220
Don't tell him.

956
01:30:50.288 --> 01:30:53.854
Don't tell anybody.

957
01:30:53.922 --> 01:30:57.754
B.Z., these are children
we're talking about.


958
01:30:57.823 --> 01:31:03.420
Yes. And who appreciates
them better than I?


959
01:31:03.489 --> 01:31:08.103
These... industrious
little boys and girls...


960
01:31:08.172 --> 01:31:11.771
<i>Saving all their</i>
<i>nickels and dimes...</i>


961
01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:15.704
<i>To get the magic candy canes</i>
<i>I promised them.</i>


962
01:31:15.773 --> 01:31:18.838
<i>They'll get</i>
<i>what they paid for.</i>


963
01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:22.838
<i>If these people are so reckless as
to have radiators in their houses--</i>


964
01:31:22.906 --> 01:31:24.971
reckless?
Towser,


965
01:31:25.039 --> 01:31:27.370
how does Brazil
sound to you?


966
01:31:27.439 --> 01:31:29.370
Brazil?
Brazil.


967
01:31:29.439 --> 01:31:33.303
Sandy beaches,
tropical breezes,


968
01:31:33.372 --> 01:31:37.303
big rum drinks
with pineapple in them,


969
01:31:37.372 --> 01:31:41.203
senoritas
in string bikinis,


970
01:31:41.272 --> 01:31:46.337
and-- oh, yes--
no extradition proceedings.


971
01:31:46.405 --> 01:31:49.604
You mean--
you and me, Eric.


972
01:31:49.673 --> 01:31:52.203
We'll take the cash...

973
01:31:52.272 --> 01:31:55.537
And let the elf
face the music.


974
01:32:19.755 --> 01:32:22.871
Listen, kid. You wanna
die on me when I'm gone?


975
01:32:22.939 --> 01:32:25.637
Be my guest.

976
01:32:27.639 --> 01:32:31.270
<i>Dear Santa, you've gotta help.</i>

977
01:32:31.338 --> 01:32:34.020
<i>Joe's been taken prisoner</i>
<i>by a very bad man.</i>


978
01:32:34.088 --> 01:32:36.587
<i>I'm sorry to say</i>
<i>he's a relation of mine.</i>


979
01:32:36.656 --> 01:32:40.253
Cornelia, what are you doing? You're
ten minutes late for breakfast.


980
01:32:40.322 --> 01:32:42.320
I'm coming.

981
01:32:59.823 --> 01:33:04.220
Just what I thought.

982
01:33:06.088 --> 01:33:11.554
<i>I think we should prepare the first shipments
of pine wood as early as April this time.</i>


983
01:33:11.623 --> 01:33:14.320
Don't you agree, Santa?

984
01:33:17.322 --> 01:33:20.086
What's this?

985
01:33:20.155 --> 01:33:22.353
Looks like a letter.
In January?


986
01:33:22.422 --> 01:33:25.721
A bit early for next
Christmas, isn't it?


987
01:33:25.789 --> 01:33:28.754
It's familiar writing.

988
01:33:34.706 --> 01:33:37.871
- Saddle up the reindeer! - But it's
only two weeks since they've been out.


989
01:33:37.938 --> 01:33:40.053
This can't wait.

990
01:33:40.122 --> 01:33:42.854
Ah! Just the elves I want to see.
Hitch up the reindeer.


991
01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:45.919
<i>We're flying out at 1900 hours!</i>
That's what we came to tell you.

992
01:33:45.988 --> 01:33:48.154
<i>It's comet and cupid.</i>
What about them?


993
01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:51.187
- They've got flu.

994
01:33:51.256 --> 01:33:55.220
This would have to happen now. Well,
I'll have to make do with six.


995
01:33:55.289 --> 01:33:57.320
<i>Get them ready.</i>
<i>Feed them.</i>


996
01:33:57.389 --> 01:33:59.704
Little Joe needs me.

997
01:34:01.606 --> 01:34:04.370
<i>But, boys...</i>

998
01:34:04.439 --> 01:34:08.504
We have got ourselves
one heck of a problem here.


999
01:34:08.572 --> 01:34:11.804
Our little friend Joe
is in trouble.


1000
01:34:11.873 --> 01:34:16.370
<i>If we don't help him, I don't even
like to think of what can happen.</i>


1001
01:34:21.305 --> 01:34:24.053
Now, listen.

1002
01:34:24.122 --> 01:34:26.886
I know we're two men
short today.


1003
01:34:26.955 --> 01:34:29.387
But this time...

1004
01:34:29.456 --> 01:34:31.654
You've got to fly
like the wind.


1005
01:34:31.722 --> 01:34:35.320
<i>Can you do it for me?</i>

1006
01:34:35.389 --> 01:34:37.886
Can you do it
for little Joe?


1007
01:34:43.722 --> 01:34:46.187
Sure you can!

1008
01:34:51.105 --> 01:34:53.069
- All right, men.

1009
01:34:53.406 --> 01:34:57.320
<i>Give me that extra effort.</i>
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>


1010
01:34:57.389 --> 01:34:59.387
Yo!

1011
01:35:01.689 --> 01:35:06.771
Come on, blitzen!
Come on!


1012
01:35:47.322 --> 01:35:50.086
My gosh!
What are you doing down here?


1013
01:35:50.155 --> 01:35:53.286
As if you didn't know!

1014
01:35:53.355 --> 01:35:55.253
Me?
Yeah, you!


1015
01:35:55.322 --> 01:35:58.820
You ruined Christmas! But I never did.
What are you talking about?


1016
01:35:58.889 --> 01:36:02.053
He said that kids didn't like him no more!
You don't even know Santa claus.


1017
01:36:02.122 --> 01:36:04.053
Do so!
<i>Do not!</i>


1018
01:36:04.122 --> 01:36:06.487
He said I was his only
friend left, you dumb punk!


1019
01:36:06.556 --> 01:36:11.820
But I-- I was just-- I just wanted him
to see what a good assistant I could be.


1020
01:36:11.889 --> 01:36:15.554
He's seen what you are.
You're a dumb, stupid idiot,


1021
01:36:15.623 --> 01:36:18.420
stink-face creep who made the
kids hate the best guy ever!


1022
01:36:18.489 --> 01:36:21.286
Hey, what is this? Give me that!
It's mine!


1023
01:36:21.355 --> 01:36:23.753
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.


1024
01:36:23.822 --> 01:36:26.753
See, I told you
I was his best friend.


1025
01:36:26.822 --> 01:36:31.086
My elf-portrait.
He does like me after all.


1026
01:36:31.523 --> 01:36:33.654
Huh?
Come on, kid.


1027
01:36:33.722 --> 01:36:36.853
Where are we going? We're
going to the north pole.


1028
01:36:36.921 --> 01:36:41.203
We'll both go. And for once, we'll
bring Santa claus a present.


1029
01:36:44.539 --> 01:36:46.570
It's you!
Thank heavens!


1030
01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:48.570
How is he?
I don't know.


1031
01:36:48.639 --> 01:36:51.769
Where is he? My step-Uncle's got him.
Those candy canes--


1032
01:36:51.838 --> 01:36:54.270
shhh.
Tell me on the way.


1033
01:36:58.155 --> 01:37:01.586
They exploded? That's what they said.
When they got hot.


1034
01:37:01.655 --> 01:37:04.420
I called the police, but
I don't think they believed me.


1035
01:37:04.488 --> 01:37:08.019
We've got to hurry.
Come on, boys!


1036
01:37:08.088 --> 01:37:12.253
Enough here to take care of all next year's
Christmas orders. Santa claus can take a year off.


1037
01:37:12.322 --> 01:37:14.719
His first vacation. Won't that be great?
Yeah, neat.


1038
01:37:14.788 --> 01:37:18.819
Oh, wow!
Yeah, good, huh?


1039
01:37:18.888 --> 01:37:21.587
- <i>Ahhh!</i>
- Put your seat belt on.


1040
01:37:31.805 --> 01:37:34.970
Hey, this is neat!
Yeah.


1041
01:37:37.972 --> 01:37:41.220
It's them! Both of them! Oh, no!

1042
01:37:41.289 --> 01:37:44.986
What is it? Look. The candy canes!
They're in the car with 'em.


1043
01:37:45.055 --> 01:37:47.686
Patch doesn't know
they explode.


1044
01:37:47.754 --> 01:37:50.986
Fly, boys!
Fly like the wind!


1045
01:37:51.055 --> 01:37:54.187
Fly like you've never flown before!
Come on!


1046
01:38:02.272 --> 01:38:04.287
<i>Okay, we know you're up there.</i>

1047
01:38:04.355 --> 01:38:07.086
Now, come on down
with your hands held high!


1048
01:38:07.155 --> 01:38:10.752
<i>Unit 71, are you 10-4?</i>

1049
01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:17.253
Let's go.

1050
01:38:26.988 --> 01:38:29.086
<i>Open up! Police!</i>

1051
01:38:29.155 --> 01:38:33.203
- <i>We know you're in there!</i>
- <i>We'll kick the door!</i>


1052
01:38:33.272 --> 01:38:37.270
- <i>We're comin' in! Hold it!</i>

1053
01:38:40.388 --> 01:38:43.187
Whoa. Whoa!

1054
01:38:43.255 --> 01:38:47.020
Whooooaaaaah!

1055
01:38:47.322 --> 01:38:49.571
What the--

1056
01:38:49.638 --> 01:38:53.553
oh, this is neat!

1057
01:38:53.621 --> 01:38:58.020
I can do anything with
this car I want. Watch.


1058
01:39:16.905 --> 01:39:20.070
- Fly, boys!
- Can't they go any faster?


1059
01:39:20.139 --> 01:39:24.003
They usually get a year's rest.
They're doing their best.


1060
01:39:24.072 --> 01:39:26.803
<i>Fly!</i>
<i>Come on, boys!</i>


1061
01:39:42.105 --> 01:39:44.254
Oh, wow!

1062
01:39:45.638 --> 01:39:47.803
Ohhh!

1063
01:39:53.772 --> 01:39:55.903
Come on!
That's it, boys!


1064
01:39:55.971 --> 01:39:58.220
Come on, now!
Come on!


1065
01:39:59.722 --> 01:40:02.521
That's the way.
That's the way. Come on.


1066
01:40:02.588 --> 01:40:05.887
That's my good boys.
Come on!


1067
01:40:15.355 --> 01:40:17.453
Yippee!

1068
01:40:19.489 --> 01:40:22.686
Oh, my gosh!

1069
01:40:22.755 --> 01:40:24.970
Joe! Joe!

1070
01:40:25.038 --> 01:40:28.203
<i>Come on, boys!</i>
<i>That's patch in there!</i>


1071
01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:32.137
If you love him like he loves
you, give it all you got!


1072
01:40:32.205 --> 01:40:34.403
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>


1073
01:40:34.472 --> 01:40:37.470
Come on, blitzen!
Come on, donner!


1074
01:40:40.889 --> 01:40:43.253
Can we go higher?
Of course, Joe.


1075
01:40:49.022 --> 01:40:51.254
Something's happening!
Patch! Oh, no!


1076
01:40:59.755 --> 01:41:04.653
Do something! The super-dooper looper.
It's the only way.


1077
01:41:04.721 --> 01:41:07.053
<i>Come on, donner!</i>
<i>You can do it!</i>


1078
01:41:07.122 --> 01:41:10.020
I know you can do it!
Come on! Faster!


1079
01:41:10.088 --> 01:41:12.686
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Faster!</i>


1080
01:41:12.755 --> 01:41:16.220
What's going on?

1081
01:41:16.522 --> 01:41:19.686
Here we go! Hang on!
Here we go!


1082
01:41:22.955 --> 01:41:26.786
Give it all you got!
Come on, now! Come on!


1083
01:41:30.088 --> 01:41:32.154
Hah! Hah!

1084
01:41:32.222 --> 01:41:35.535
<i>Come on, donner!</i>
<i>Come on! You can do it!</i>


1085
01:41:35.604 --> 01:41:37.719
Santa! It's Santa!

1086
01:41:37.788 --> 01:41:40.370
Santa! Aah!

1087
01:41:42.938 --> 01:41:45.803
All right!

1088
01:41:47.972 --> 01:41:50.336
Santa!

1089
01:41:50.406 --> 01:41:53.452
Dash it away, donner!
Dash it away!


1090
01:41:56.505 --> 01:41:58.553
Joe!

1091
01:42:10.172 --> 01:42:13.402
Oh! Oh, my boys!

1092
01:42:13.471 --> 01:42:17.720
<i>I've seen some reindeer in my time,
but you're the best, the best!</i>


1093
01:42:17.788 --> 01:42:20.903
We did it! We did it!
Ha-ha-ha!


1094
01:42:20.971 --> 01:42:23.553
<i>Well done, donner!</i>

1095
01:42:25.655 --> 01:42:28.486
Way to go, donner!

1096
01:42:28.555 --> 01:42:31.520
Patch, this is corny.
Corny, meet patch.


1097
01:42:31.588 --> 01:42:34.836
Hi, corny.
Nice to meet you, patch.


1098
01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:43.786
Yeah.

1099
01:42:49.155 --> 01:42:51.154
What about corny?

1100
01:42:55.356 --> 01:42:59.753
Can I stay? Just till next Christmas.
Please?


1101
01:42:59.821 --> 01:43:03.986
And you can give her
a lift home next year.


1102
01:43:04.055 --> 01:43:06.753
<i>Well, dooley?</i> As if I
don't have enough to do.


1103
01:43:06.821 --> 01:43:09.053
Now I'm going to have to be
a school teacher.


1104
01:43:09.122 --> 01:43:11.653
School?

1105
01:43:53.055 --> 01:43:56.486
