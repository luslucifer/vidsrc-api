1
00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.045
Ike! Let's go!

2
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.715
Cut out that damn crying.

3
00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.086
I'll teach her.

4
00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.731
Burn the outside!

5
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.308
Katy!

6
00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.177
Bill!

7
00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:27.393
Katy!

8
00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.422
Howdy.

9
00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:36.424
You're Mr. Talion, ain't ya?

10
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.769
I figured that I'd find ya here.

11
00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:42.775
I come to do you a favor.

12
00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:47.610
Of course it's got a price,
but I figured it's worth it to ya.


13
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.210
What are you talking about?

14
00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:59.648
Well...

15
00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:03.287
I know who done this...

16
00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:06.127
I thought you'd like to know,

17
00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:11.967
and that you'd be willing
to pay me a little--


18
00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:16.805
something for the information.

19
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.299
Well...

20
00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:19.971
Who did it?

21
00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.172
Well...

22
00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:27.711
For God's sakes...

23
00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:30.278
you wouldn't
shoot an old man.


24
00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:34.589
I know you're going to make
a real big splatter this close.


25
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:38.855
If you shoot me,
you never will know who done it.


26
00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:43.299
Ike Slant...

27
00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.031
and the Beetson brothers.

28
00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.507
Where are they now?

29
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.213
I don't know.
I heard them talking


30
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.415
about how they done
this to get even with ya.


31
00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:06.948
As God is my judge,
that's all I know,


32
00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:10.394
that's all I know,
I don't know where they went.


33
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.392
I think you just better
get the hell out of here, mister.


34
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.114
Come on.

35
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.342
It's a real nice camp you got here.

36
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.851
It ain't ordinary,
a stranger walking up


37
00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.648
on me like you just done.

38
00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.923
Maybe you ain't ordinary.

39
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.926
Well, l...

40
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.894
I've been called a lot of things.

41
00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.595
You didn't walk way out here?

42
00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:35.573
No, that's...

43
00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:38.173
That's right, I guess I didn't.

44
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.510
Dolly and my outfitter are
out there behind the brush.


45
00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.379
You mind if we share
your camp with you?


46
00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.079
Dolly?

47
00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:48.848
Well, no.

48
00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:50.378
No, I guess it'll be all right.

49
00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:54.826
Well, good. I'll just
bring her in to meet ya.


50
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:05.567
Well, girl, it looks like
we got company for a change, huh?


51
00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:12.571
I would like for you
to meet my friend Dolly.


52
00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:14.374
Dolly, this is...

53
00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:15.880
What did you say your name was?

54
00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.712
Put her over there.

55
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.718
All right.

56
00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.977
Can you shoot that thing straight?

57
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.695
Yeah. Straight enough.

58
00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.566
You practice like
this every night, huh?


59
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:44.296
No.

60
00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:47.464
Sometimes I get
it done earlier in the day,


61
00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:50.942
but it always gets done,
one way or another.


62
00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:55.511
That's a real fancy
rig you got there, boy.


63
00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.643
I earned it.

64
00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:00.584
I'll just bet you did.

65
00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.678
Benny Wallace, huh?

66
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.352
Didn't expect the word
to travel so far.


67
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.190
Oh, word about bounty hunters,

68
00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:12.163
that travels pretty far, pretty fast.

69
00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:13.756
It will always beat you home, boy.

70
00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.865
I have no home.

71
00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:21.506
By the way, you haven't
told me your name.


72
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:28.145
My name is Talion.

73
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.212
Talion?

74
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.014
I've been waiting
a long time to meet you.


75
00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:35.577
Are you sure?

76
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:38.749
I've done my share
of practicing, too, boy.


77
00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:42.352
I never went in much
for an audience, though.


78
00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:45.124
You ever notice a man gets
to the top of the heap,


79
00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:49.157
there's always somebody
clamoring up to try and take his place.


80
00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:52.634
Takes a little doin'.

81
00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:56.232
Well, I don't guess you figure
anybody's got that much doin' in them.


82
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.072
You just turn around.

83
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.909
You'll get your chance.

84
00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:09.418
What are you doing
in this territory anyway?


85
00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:14.559
I'm just looking.

86
00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:17.391
Why, I heard you quit
bounty hunting.


87
00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.897
You getting a little
rusty, ain't ya?


88
00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:23.163
Especially for lke Slant
and them Beetson brothers.


89
00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.270
Could be.

90
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.140
Ike Slant's a top gun.

91
00:13:33.178 --> 00:13:36.238
A top gun, no.

92
00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:38.580
No, lke Slant is the top gun, boy.

93
00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:43.916
He's smart. That's why
the Beetson brothers are his insurance.


94
00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:46.424
You want to be smart?

95
00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.926
You be my insurance...

96
00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.792
I'll be yours.

97
00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.928
You ain't getting no help from me.

98
00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:56.594
No, you figure on taking
all three of them by yourself?


99
00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:59.433
I ain't splitting that
reward money with nobody.


100
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:03.066
Oh, I figured we could...

101
00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:05.201
decide on that after we get it.

102
00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.609
Yeah.

103
00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:10.638
Yeah, we could at that.

104
00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:15.382
It's kinda hard to figure...

105
00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:18.650
Talion needs help.

106
00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:25.155
I just want to make sure
they all die, son.


107
00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.668
Good night, boy.

108
00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:11.172
I heard you've been known to get up
from the wrong side.


109
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.508
Dolly ain't got no wrong sides.

110
00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:15.675
It just don't look right.

111
00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:17.545
Draw, bounty hunter.

112
00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.710
The wrong side, huh?

113
00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:25.220
Come on.

114
00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.425
You intend going in?

115
00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.094
Might as well.

116
00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:45.603
Could be they just circled around,
and that's where they're at.


117
00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.104
Yeah, could be.

118
00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:49.607
Let's not ask too many questions
when we get down there,


119
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.802
if they've been there, we'll know it.

120
00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:57.809
There's one by that shack. Come on.

121
00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:20.862
Hiya, stranger.

122
00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:22.897
- Howdy.
- Howdy.


123
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.273
I'm Jo
-Hi.

124
00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:28.336
Well, Jo-Hi, who's
the big boss around here?


125
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.540
You're talking to him.

126
00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:32.482
Oh, this is your place, huh?

127
00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:35.351
Do you mind if we step down
and stretch our legs a little bit?


128
00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.821
Not a bit of it.
You're welcome to.


129
00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.824
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


130
00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:41.485
Is there anybody
else around here?


131
00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:44.394
Sure, my sister and my pa,
they work for me.


132
00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:47.865
Yeah, well, I got an idea
you ain't easy to work for either, huh?


133
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.492
I'm fair.

134
00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.503
You want to show us
around a little bit?


135
00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:52.663
Sure, come in the house.

136
00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:53.693
OK.

137
00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:07.846
Howdy, ma'am.

138
00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.854
Howdy.

139
00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:11.378
Could I help you?

140
00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.186
My name's Quince.
Brian Quince.


141
00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:15.352
- Mr. Quince.
- Anchor, fur buyer,


142
00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:18.795
calligrapher, Justice of the Peace,
et cetera, et cetera.


143
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.195
This is my daughter Bri,

144
00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:22.291
and I see you've met the boss.

145
00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:24.768
I'm Bill Tyler, Mr. Quince,

146
00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:26.566
and this is my partner Bill Waters.

147
00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.368
Oh, a couple of Bills, huh?

148
00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:32.173
Say, it seems a might
peculiar, don't it?


149
00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.941
Ah, don't let Dad scare ya.
I can handle him.


150
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.710
Oh, that's the way
the wind blows, is it?


151
00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:40.718
If I were you, young fella,
I'd be mighty careful.


152
00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:43.915
We don't get many young men
passing through here.


153
00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:49.424
Say, you fellas must be hungry.

154
00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:50.792
Yes, sir. We are.

155
00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:53.093
Well, nothing much
happens around here,


156
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:55.691
and we kinda look
forward to mealtime.


157
00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:58.567
Sometimes get to it a might early.

158
00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:02.472
Bri, do you think maybe
you could warm up something now?


159
00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:05.265
All right.

160
00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:09.103
Say, uh, you fellas got business
in the territory?


161
00:19:09.147 --> 00:19:10.910
Well, sir, my partner and me are...

162
00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:13.509
kinda looking for new fields.

163
00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.179
I thought we might
try a little mining.


164
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.847
I understand this is
the country for it here.


165
00:19:16.888 --> 00:19:18.378
You ain't no miner.

166
00:19:18.423 --> 00:19:20.152
Well, no, Jo
-Hi.

167
00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:22.092
Am I wrong?

168
00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:25.255
Ah, you figure I'm too old to learn?

169
00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:27.492
Well, there's a lot to learn.

170
00:19:27.532 --> 00:19:28.624
Maybe you could learn me?

171
00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.635
Not too good.

172
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:33.433
Running this post
takes about all my time.


173
00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:36.964
Yes, and there's a lot of chores
to be done in the back room.


174
00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:41.173
You're right. Plan to do
them tomorrow morning.


175
00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.773
Well, if you want
to learn about mining,


176
00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:45.942
I'll get you started.

177
00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:48.111
Well, all right, what do I do?

178
00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:50.747
I start my day's work at 5:30.

179
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:53.758
- Meet me out in the corral.
- I'll be there.


180
00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:56.590
I better put a check on Bri.

181
00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:57.993
Well, good.

182
00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:08.964
How long you been working for him?

183
00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:11.840
Ever since the day he was born.

184
00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:26.648
Seems our new friends
have been accepted.


185
00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:30.327
I gave you some on your birthday.

186
00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:32.694
Yes, you did.

187
00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:42.632
- More coffee?
- Yeah, I'll have some.


188
00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:44.835
No thank you.

189
00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:46.366
Jo
-Hi.

190
00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:49.906
Thank you.

191
00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:52.712
Let me help, all right?

192
00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.154
That's not like eating
on the trail, is it?


193
00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:03.794
Well, good night.

194
00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:05.888
Well, good night.

195
00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:11.191
Oh, uh, Jo
-Hi...

196
00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:12.726
Thank you.

197
00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:16.040
Yeah, thank you very much, Jo
-Hi.

198
00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:17.405
Thanks a lot.

199
00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:26.684
Never knew Jo-Hi
to jelly bean strangers before.


200
00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.184
Where'd he get
a name like Jo-Hi?


201
00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:35.922
Oh, it's just how he is and
always has been so dang high and mighty.


202
00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:38.725
Everybody's always
called him Jo-Hi.


203
00:21:38.764 --> 00:21:42.894
Hey, it's time an old man
locked up and went to bed.


204
00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:45.232
Bed sounds like a good idea.

205
00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:48.573
Thank you very much, Miss.

206
00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.268
You're welcome.

207
00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:56.603
Mr. Quince...

208
00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:00.581
Ike Slant, do you know him?

209
00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:02.917
So, he is coming back.

210
00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:06.219
My, he turned out bad, real bad.

211
00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:08.021
Always knew he would.

212
00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:10.960
Got a circular on him
just the other day.


213
00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:14.989
Kind of thought
he'd be headed this way.


214
00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:18.928
Good thing they put
you boys right on him.


215
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.371
You know, I could tell,
the way you handled your guns,


216
00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:24.773
- you knew how to use them.
- Oh, yeah.


217
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.270
And, uh, keeping your badges
hid that way is a good idea.


218
00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:31.782
Oh, I won't let on.

219
00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:33.478
You boys federal?

220
00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:36.453
Well, we're, um...

221
00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:38.513
- Sort of...
- Oh, it doesn't matter.


222
00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:41.117
Anybody but that old Duff
from Sortie Wells.


223
00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:42.751
He was a good sheriff in his day,

224
00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.694
but he ain't no match for lke Slant.

225
00:22:44.729 --> 00:22:46.959
Is this what you're looking for?

226
00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:48.556
Why, yes.

227
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.831
I see lke's traveling
with a couple of bad ones, too.


228
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.132
Yeah.

229
00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:54.798
How soon you figure it'll be
before he gets here?


230
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.365
- Oh, he's here.
- You sure of that?


231
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:58.967
We tracked him all the way.

232
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.308
He's probably
going out to his old place.


233
00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:02.472
Where's that?

234
00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:06.245
Well, it's pretty much out of the way
from here--I could draw you a map.


235
00:23:06.284 --> 00:23:08.479
We'd be obliged.

236
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.681
Here.

237
00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.623
Now we're right here,
you cut across the flats


238
00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:16.786
in this direction near Boulder Creek,
through Boulder Canyon.


239
00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.318
Ike's place is right over here,

240
00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:22.493
you just go right down here,
around, and come right up back of it.


241
00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.365
Thank you very much, Mr. Quince.

242
00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:25.562
You're welcome.

243
00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.200
I'll, uh, bed the horses in.

244
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.368
Excuse me, l...

245
00:23:57.402 --> 00:23:59.734
I didn't knock.

246
00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:06.066
Could you tell me what time it is?

247
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:07.635
Right there.

248
00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:11.581
Oh, there it is, yeah, well...

249
00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:15.584
Say, that sure is
a beautiful clock.


250
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:20.087
Yeah, I hadn't noticed
that before, that...


251
00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:23.390
That's a beautiful clock.

252
00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:25.396
That's...

253
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.227
That's some clock, huh?

254
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.268
That's a good one.

255
00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.770
Yes, yes, it is.

256
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.101
Oh, I'll bet that
keeps good time, too.


257
00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.803
Oh, yes, yes, it does.

258
00:24:38.843 --> 00:24:39.935
Yeah.

259
00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.842
Well, good night then.

260
00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:46.077
- Mr. Talion.
- Yeah.


261
00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:47.880
That clock there, it...

262
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:49.386
it strikes on the hour,

263
00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:52.549
and it's almost eight o'clock.

264
00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:56.527
The chiming's lovely,
won't you stay and listen?


265
00:24:56.561 --> 00:24:58.426
Yeah, I'd like to very much.

266
00:24:58.463 --> 00:25:00.590
- Good.
- Can I help you?


267
00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:02.259
Yes.

268
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.632
- There you go.
- Thank you.


269
00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.439
Well, now...

270
00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:10.031
How do you like Tillumuck?

271
00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.804
Fine.

272
00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:16.113
Tillumuck?

273
00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:18.081
Oh, this valley, it's--

274
00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:20.107
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

275
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:22.312
Named after an lndian chief.

276
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.458
Were you named after
an lndian chief, too?


277
00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:30.154
Me? Of course not. Why?

278
00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:33.596
Well, you got some pretty funny names
around here, you know, Jo-Hi,


279
00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:36.123
and Tillumuck, and...

280
00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:38.829
I've never meet
no Bris before either.


281
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.067
Well, I was supposed to be a boy,

282
00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:45.668
called Brian after my father,

283
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.703
only the folks named
me Brianna, Bri for short.


284
00:25:53.652 --> 00:25:55.085
You like it here?

285
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.351
Oh, I was born here.

286
00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:04.056
So, you lived all your life in...

287
00:26:04.095 --> 00:26:05.824
- Tillumuck?
- Tillumuck.


288
00:26:05.864 --> 00:26:08.856
Yes, all my life.

289
00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:12.233
Where's your home?

290
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.474
Well, I was...

291
00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:23.545
Do you think that
you will be staying a while?


292
00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:28.011
Well, I can't really say about that.

293
00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:31.853
Bill, he's sort of
my partner, and...


294
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.552
You know, I'll have to hear
what he's got to say about that.


295
00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:38.222
Where might you be going, then?

296
00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:42.393
We've got some business
that's got to be done with.


297
00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:46.063
Oh.

298
00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:53.403
Maybe on the way back
I could stop by?


299
00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:00.441
Maybe?

300
00:27:00.485 --> 00:27:03.215
Well, it ain't a question
of not wanting to.


301
00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:04.243
It's...

302
00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:09.083
It's just that we
got to do something...


303
00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:12.953
and then if I can, 
I'll come back.

304
00:27:14.365 --> 00:27:19.928
You know, you really seem
old enough to do what you please.


305
00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:31.082
Yes, sir, that is sure
some beautiful clock.


306
00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:35.950
Well...

307
00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:39.286
I think I better get to bed.

308
00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:45.626
Thanks. The meal was fine.

309
00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:48.422
Bill?

310
00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:52.300
I...Well, good night.

311
00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:57.601
Ms. Bri, I do want to come back.

312
00:27:57.642 --> 00:28:00.475
Well, you'd be welcome.

313
00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:25.860
Well, Mr. Bill, that's about all
I know about finding gold.


314
00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:30.167
Well, thanks, Jo-Hi.
That gives me a good start.


315
00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:32.301
Do you really want
to be a miner?


316
00:28:32.343 --> 00:28:35.278
Well, I don't know.
It seems like a good idea.


317
00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:37.804
- Not to me it don't.
- It don't.


318
00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:39.749
What do you want to be
when you grow up?


319
00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:43.311
Well, I don't know,
I'll just have to wait till I grow up.


320
00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:45.345
Well, that's...

321
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.085
That will happen, Jo
-Hi.

322
00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.649
You don't have to rush that.

323
00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:51.321
You know, Mr. Bill,
they ain't fooling me.


324
00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:53.830
I don't really run this place at all.

325
00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.730
Well, it appears to me you do.

326
00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.735
Well, in some ways I do,

327
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.964
but they won't
even let me carry a gun.


328
00:29:00.004 --> 00:29:01.301
A gun?

329
00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:03.432
Sure, how are you going
to run anything without a gun?


330
00:29:03.474 --> 00:29:04.668
Well, you don't need a gun.

331
00:29:04.709 --> 00:29:06.199
What would you do
with one if you had it?


332
00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.303
What do you do with yours?

333
00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:11.447
Well, that's different.

334
00:29:11.482 --> 00:29:12.949
I'm on the trail and everything.

335
00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:17.011
I use mine--I shoot
rabbits and deer, you know, to eat.


336
00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:19.615
You got a rifle
in your saddle for that.


337
00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.251
Yeah.

338
00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:24.591
Hey, I'll tell you what.

339
00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:26.529
I'll whittle you
a make-believe gun.


340
00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:29.032
I ain't gonna do no good
with a wooden gun.


341
00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:30.466
No? I'm going
to whittle it so good


342
00:29:30.501 --> 00:29:33.402
that only you and I will
know that it isn't real.


343
00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.700
Can you make it that good?

344
00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:35.865
Yeah, I can.

345
00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:37.204
And only me and you will know?

346
00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:38.766
Just us.

347
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.176
Ok? Now, mind you,
my partner Bill and l,


348
00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:43.476
we have to leave today,
but when we get back,


349
00:29:43.514 --> 00:29:45.880
I'll give you the gun, OK?

350
00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:48.215
Let's get inside, it's cold.

351
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.786
Howdy.

352
00:29:55.827 --> 00:29:57.419
Oh, by the way, Quince,

353
00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:59.726
I saw lke Slant with two strangers.

354
00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:02.494
- Where?
- Up near Box Canyon.


355
00:30:02.533 --> 00:30:05.058
You going to send Shorty Wells
for Sheriff Wilson?


356
00:30:05.103 --> 00:30:09.665
Well, I could, Harry,
but that won't be necessary.


357
00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:15.268
Let's get moving.

358
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.652
Well, we'll sure
drop by before long.


359
00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:26.156
Will you really?

360
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:28.920
I will, anyhow.

361
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.326
Oh, I almost forgot.

362
00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:33.387
I packed a lunch for you.

363
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:36.093
It's in on the table.

364
00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:39.729
Oh, well, thanks.

365
00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:42.962
Hey.

366
00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:52.349
How did you know
we'd be leaving today?


367
00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:53.850
Jo
-Hi told me.

368
00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:59.452
That's quite a boy.

369
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.355
Yes, he is.

370
00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:03.451
He thinks you're quite a man.

371
00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.826
I agree with him.

372
00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:11.325
It'll take quite a man.

373
00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:22.538
Yeah, I bet it will.

374
00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:29.582
You...

375
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:34.819
put up a lunch for every stranger
that comes through town?


376
00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:39.853
No, but I always figure
I'd know who to cook for.


377
00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:29.110
We'll take a look at the ground
this game is going to be played on.


378
00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:30.580
Box Canyon's up ahead.

379
00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:37.783
Well, well, well, wrong side.

380
00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:46.622
Just thought I'd see how it felt.

381
00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.734
How did it feel, then?

382
00:32:50.768 --> 00:32:52.065
All right.

383
00:32:53.204 --> 00:32:55.729
- You pokin' fun at me?
- I wouldn't do a thing like that.


384
00:32:55.773 --> 00:32:58.139
- So help me, Talion.
- You just stay loose, boy.


385
00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:00.736
You got to learn
to laugh a little bit.


386
00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.837
You've got plenty
of time to be serious.


387
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:06.108
Well, when that time
comes, you better be ready.


388
00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:14.489
Ya see how ya are, boy.
You're always threatening me.


389
00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:18.320
That ain't no threat.

390
00:33:18.362 --> 00:33:20.523
Benny Wallace you're talking to.

391
00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:24.126
Oh, yeah, bounty hunter, hm?

392
00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:27.137
The number one bounty hunter,
what's your number?


393
00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:29.731
Look, when I call you that,
I'm calling myself the same thing,


394
00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:31.674
because I kill for money, too,

395
00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:34.803
but I ain't gonna make up
any fancy names for it.


396
00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:37.474
Let's get to it.

397
00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:05.697
I don't see Slant.

398
00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:07.727
Do you think we passed
him on the way in?


399
00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:12.700
Let's take the Beetsons now
and wait for Slant down there.


400
00:35:12.743 --> 00:35:15.211
- No.
- Why not?


401
00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:18.738
Because lke Slant spent
the first 20 years of his life


402
00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.045
in this part of the country,

403
00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:22.348
I bet he's got a dozen ways
to get out of this canyon,


404
00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:25.412
and each one of them gives him
as good a look as we get right now.


405
00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:30.060
If everything don't
look just right to him,


406
00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:32.756
we'd have to go a long ways
to find him again.


407
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.622
We got company.

408
00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:49.868
What would be your idea?

409
00:36:55.946 --> 00:36:58.540
It appears to me
that if we split up,

410
00:36:58.582 --> 00:37:01.483
one of us come in
from them broken rocks on the right,


411
00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:04.784
the other corners in
from that smooth flat rock on the left,


412
00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:07.154
we'd have them in a pretty
good crossfire.


413
00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:08.681
And then if we--

414
00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:12.560
You got any idea
of taking them in alive?


415
00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:14.853
No.

416
00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:18.698
All right, then.

417
00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:23.669
If we don't get them all
on the first crack,


418
00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.699
they'd have to come by one
of us on their way out.


419
00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:31.678
If their horses set up there
pretty close behind them,


420
00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:35.208
I guess it'd be they'd high-tail it
out that ravine to the left.


421
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.825
You know, you could
live a long time.


422
00:37:44.228 --> 00:37:46.025
I will.

423
00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:56.069
It's time.

424
00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.288
It's been a long ride, lke!

425
00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:28.404
I didn't think you'd ever find me.

426
00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.498
You alone?

427
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:32.907
Don't bet on it.

428
00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:39.246
Oh, I can't hardly believe that.

429
00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:41.114
Believe it, lke.

430
00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:47.314
Well, now...

431
00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:50.919
just who do you suppose
would be riding with you?


432
00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:52.952
The name's Benny Wallace.

433
00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:02.596
Talion.

434
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.473
I never 'spected to see you again.

435
00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:11.306
I thought you'd hung up your guns.

436
00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.612
I did, lke...

437
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:16.313
but you put it back in my hand.

438
00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:22.820
Ike, why my wife
and my boy, why not me?


439
00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.953
Why?

440
00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:29.632
I just wanted to give
you a little something


441
00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.828
to live with for a while.

442
00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:39.204
I'm going to give you something else
to live with for a little bit.


443
00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:43.839
Remember that day that
we was waiting for you to come down?


444
00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:48.481
I sort up struck up
a little friendship


445
00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:50.680
with that wife of yours.

446
00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:54.183
If I hadn't have burnt that cabin,

447
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.693
you would have found
a whole lot worse.


448
00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:15.038
Make a run for it, boys.
I'll cover you.


449
00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:21.100
Well, did you have a good sleep?

450
00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:24.005
It's about time
you was coming to.


451
00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:29.102
How long has it been?

452
00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:32.815
It's been a couple of days.

453
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.683
A couple of days?
How come you're still here?


454
00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.678
Our job ain't done yet.

455
00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:43.557
I think Slant got away.
How are you feeling?


456
00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:46.688
Outside of a headache, pretty good.

457
00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.163
I ain't seeing just right yet.

458
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.690
You OK?

459
00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.828
I got nicked a little bit.

460
00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:56.169
Here, try some of my pot-hellion.

461
00:42:56.206 --> 00:42:58.367
You'll either
see straight or go blind, huh?


462
00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:05.079
My boots. What you
done with my boots?


463
00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:07.379
All right. Take it easy.
I'll get your boots.


464
00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:30.398
Think Slant went far?

465
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.375
I can't really tell.

466
00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:34.001
When he gets to his feet
the way he did,


467
00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:35.944
he certainly might be feeling
pretty good by now.


468
00:43:35.979 --> 00:43:38.607
Well, why didn't you find out?

469
00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:40.708
From all the blabber I heard,

470
00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:43.720
it appears to me nothing
would stop you from finding out.


471
00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:46.882
If that have been the thing to do, Ben,
I would have done it.


472
00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:49.449
Now, as soon as you
gonna feel like moving,


473
00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:51.222
we've got some money to pick up.

474
00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:52.728
I'm ready.

475
00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:55.425
All right, I'll hitch up the horses.

476
00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:33.636
I can still saddle
my own horse, Ben.


477
00:44:34.805 --> 00:44:36.966
Oh, sure.

478
00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:23.813
Talion! Talion!

479
00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:25.185
Whoa.

480
00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:33.657
Benny, what's the matter?

481
00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:35.062
I can't see out of--

482
00:45:35.098 --> 00:45:37.532
Hold it, hold it,
take it easy. Take it easy.


483
00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.840
All right, just calm down, kid.

484
00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:45.705
It will pass, we got you
on your feet too soon.


485
00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:55.217
Let me see if we can find a place
for us around here to camp.


486
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.745
Stand still and don't move.

487
00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:06.152
Take hold of the shoulder.

488
00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:08.357
Don't spook up, man.

489
00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:09.888
Let's just walk.

490
00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:14.704
We're going through some brush.

491
00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:15.727
Come on.

492
00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:34.423
Talion?

493
00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:36.920
Talion?

494
00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:40.419
Yeah. What is it, kid?

495
00:46:42.432 --> 00:46:44.059
I thought you'd gone.

496
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:49.797
I'm not going to leave you, Ben--

497
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.240
not for a while, anyway.

498
00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:54.073
I ain't forgetting.

499
00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.102
You ain't forgetting what?

500
00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:05.446
- You still looking to gun me?
- That's right.


501
00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:30.212
All right, kid. 
It's time, get up.

502
00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:34.979
You better go on alone.
I'll wait for you here.


503
00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:37.987
Slant might come back.
I'll saddle your horse. I'll rig you in.


504
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.321
What do you think you're going to do?

505
00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.826
Come and lead me, same as them?

506
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.125
Well, you ain't, not Benny Wallace.

507
00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:50.531
Benny Wallace ain't going
to be led around like no blind man!


508
00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.967
Look, boy, we play this thing right,
nobody needs to know anything.


509
00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:54.129
I'll stick by you every second.

510
00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:56.799
All you have to do is make out
like you can see as good as ever.


511
00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.308
Now I'm not gonna let
anybody near ya.


512
00:47:59.343 --> 00:48:03.336
When we get into town,
find a doc, fix you up.


513
00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:08.814
Look, you sure you can
shoot for both of us?


514
00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:10.251
I can shoot for both of us.

515
00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:11.652
We're going on a walk,

516
00:48:11.688 --> 00:48:14.521
close enough so you can
touch me anytime you want.


517
00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:17.190
How about it?

518
00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:21.190
Come on. All right?

519
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.023
- Whoa.
- We here?


520
00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:50.549
Yeah, we're here.
Here. Hold the trim, boy.


521
00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:54.926
All right, now we're going
to have to watch ourselves


522
00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:57.229
when we sign
that deposition for the reward.


523
00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:59.235
You just follow my lead.

524
00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:06.537
Well, what are we waiting for?

525
00:49:06.576 --> 00:49:09.238
I'm going to fix my saddle.
You just hold your horses now.


526
00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:42.811
Well, is it all right?

527
00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:46.111
Yeah, it's all right.
Now, just settle down.


528
00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:05.801
OK, we got her.

529
00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.798
Give that a try.

530
00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:15.804
Let's go.

531
00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:38.161
Well, howdy.
What have we got here?


532
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.669
Hi, Mr. Bill.
You got my gun?


533
00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:45.801
My name's Talion.
This here's Benny Wallace.


534
00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:48.834
I got two packages here,
worth just $500 apiece.


535
00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:51.473
Charley and Jonas Beetson.

536
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:55.875
They're all yours.
How long will this take?


537
00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:58.854
It won't take any longer
than we can help.


538
00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:04.994
Anybody here recognize
the Beetson brothers?


539
00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.518
I could.

540
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:28.484
It's them, all right.

541
00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:33.820
I thought the Beetson boys
was traveling with lke Slant.


542
00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:35.552
You know, one of these days

543
00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:37.457
you're going to know
more than you want to.


544
00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:40.019
I'll send a telegram
for verification.


545
00:51:40.063 --> 00:51:43.191
They'll authorize me to pay
if they're still worth anything.


546
00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.894
You can come back
tomorrow morning.


547
00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:47.301
Much obliged, Mr. Quince.
Is there a doc in town?


548
00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:49.862
He come through from Marble,
twice a year.


549
00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:51.840
I'm authorized to sign
death certificates.


550
00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:56.906
OK, then, let's go.

551
00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:17.090
Always heard Talion never wore
a glove on his gun hand.


552
00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.463
I ain't got no love
for bounty hunters,


553
00:52:20.503 --> 00:52:23.063
but I'd just as soon
they brought in lke Slant, too.


554
00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:25.404
He forgot my gun.

555
00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:27.910
You get your mind
off of guns, son.


556
00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:30.344
He lied to me, too.

557
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.644
I don't think he wanted to.

558
00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.589
Never guessed a thing.
You did good, kid.


559
00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.923
Do you think we'll be able
to pull it off tomorrow?


560
00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.986
Well, tomorrow's going
to be tougher than today,


561
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.729
But we got this far.
We ought to get the prize.


562
00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.133
I can't figure you out.

563
00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:55.399
All you'd have to do
was just ride off,


564
00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:57.065
and you could have
$1,000 for yourself.


565
00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:59.371
Well, I didn't earn it by myself.

566
00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:01.775
How long do you think you
can lead a blind man around?


567
00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:04.871
Until that doctor
in Marble fixes you up,


568
00:53:04.914 --> 00:53:07.815
I guess you're just going
to have to leave it to me, kid.


569
00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:10.316
Come on, now.

570
00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:14.153
Duck your head.

571
00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:30.467
You sign that, and you can
take your money and clear out.


572
00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:31.974
That will suit us fine.

573
00:53:32.008 --> 00:53:35.000
Clearing out of places
is something we're used to.


574
00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.552
Here, Ben, make your mark.

575
00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:22.555
Here's your money.

576
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:34.867
All right, everybody.
How about a little party on us?


577
00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:36.064
Come on, Benny. Let's go.

578
00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.238
It's OK, kid. Let's go.

579
00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:58.723
Mr. Talion.

580
00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:02.220
- Mr. Talion.
- Get out of my way.


581
00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:06.065
I expect you want to find
Slant before he finds you.


582
00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.592
I can help.

583
00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:12.040
You got something to say,
then say it.


584
00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:15.938
How you going to get
the glove off fast enough?


585
00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:20.445
You got any other problems?

586
00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:41.295
Wallace signed like a blind man.

587
00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.973
I know someone who would
like to hear about this.


588
00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:56.611
What's he in such a rush about?

589
00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:58.780
He's going to tell lke Slant.

590
00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:00.449
Tell him what?

591
00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:04.153
Dad, Benny--
he can't even see.


592
00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:05.661
Well, of course he can't see.

593
00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.822
You think your dad's blind, too?

594
00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:10.462
I'm going to warn them.

595
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.968
You're going to do
nothing of the kind.


596
00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:15.266
What's the matter with you, girl?

597
00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.500
You've been going on
here for years,


598
00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.906
saying none of the young men around here
are good enough for you,


599
00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:21.843
and now you take up
with a bounty hunter.


600
00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:24.108
You got no call to warn anybody.

601
00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:26.615
Dad, they can't protect themselves.

602
00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:30.813
That's good. We'll be well off
with them two man killers out of here.


603
00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:33.880
You'd just as soon
they had brought in lke Slant.


604
00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:36.653
That's true, but there's
the law to do that.


605
00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.923
Oh, the law.
You won't even call in the sheriff.


606
00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:41.829
The last thing he wants
to do is to face lke Slant.


607
00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:45.164
- We'll settle our own affair.
- Will we?


608
00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:49.103
Bri, a good man just don't
hunt down other men to make a living.


609
00:56:49.138 --> 00:56:51.333
Now, you get them two
out of your mind.


610
00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:54.502
Their riding out of here
is the end of it for them.


611
00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:56.535
It ain't for you.

612
00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:20.034
Ike?

613
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:23.561
Ike? It's Trumbull, lke.

614
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:30.270
Ike? Ike?

615
00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:35.550
Hey...

616
00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:39.578
I knew you'd come
to your old cabin, if'n you was able.


617
00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:41.089
What do you mean, if I was able?

618
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:43.319
Look, Trumbull,
I know you pretty well,


619
00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:46.487
and you ain't the least bit
concerned with my health,


620
00:57:46.529 --> 00:57:49.430
so what's on your mind,
and how much is it going to cost me?


621
00:57:49.465 --> 00:57:52.992
I thought you'd be interested
in knowing that Talion


622
00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:59.737
and Benny Wallace brought
the Beetson brothers in...dead.


623
00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:01.243
Get to the point.

624
00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:03.074
Don't get excited.

625
00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:06.445
You know, it's a long ride up here.

626
00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:11.545
Long...cold ride.

627
00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:14.921
Here. That ought to get you back.
Now, get to talking.


628
00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:17.791
Like I said, they rode
into the trading post


629
00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:20.591
with poor old Jonas
and Charley dead...


630
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.257
with the bounty.

631
00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:26.758
But I knew all along
they didn't get you,


632
00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:29.101
but you got them.

633
00:58:29.138 --> 00:58:31.265
They're alive, ain't they?

634
00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:32.433
They're alive...

635
00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:34.102
but they ain't whole.

636
00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:37.112
Talion's got no gun hand...

637
00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:40.809
and Wallace is blind.

638
00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:48.187
- Where they at?
- I don't know, lke.


639
00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:52.183
You get the rest of this
when you find Benny and Talion for me.


640
00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:57.329
I'll find them.

641
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.324
I guess Slant knows
what's happening by now.


642
00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:30.025
When are you going after him?

643
00:59:31.934 --> 00:59:34.164
Well, you can handle lke.

644
00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.194
Why do you keep practicing for?

645
00:59:38.307 --> 00:59:40.366
Well, you're Talion, ain't ya?

646
00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:48.740
Well, I guess I ain't, kid.

647
00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:51.219
- What?
- Not anymore.


648
00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:55.281
Give me your hand.

649
00:59:55.324 --> 00:59:56.882
Take it easy.

650
00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.262
- Your gun hand?
- Yep.


651
01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.288
You mean you were
supposed to be taking care of me,


652
01:00:03.332 --> 01:00:04.822
and you can't even take
care of yourself?


653
01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.198
Well, you're here, ain't ya?

654
01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:09.170
Yeah, but how could you
take that kind of a chance?


655
01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:13.232
That bounty money
may have to carry us for a long spill, kid.


656
01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:17.709
What comes next?

657
01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:21.706
I get lke Slant,
that's what comes next.


658
01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.912
Ike Slant's still good as ever.

659
01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.716
We gotta get out of here.

660
01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.222
Get out of here, where?

661
01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:29.224
If I thought we had a chance
to make it to that doc in Marble,


662
01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:32.056
we wouldn't be holding up here,
but we ain't got that chance.


663
01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:34.563
Slant could gun us down
any place in between.


664
01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:38.226
Now I've got to get him here.

665
01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:39.632
You're crazy.

666
01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:42.137
We can't stay here
and wait for him to slaughter us.


667
01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.661
All right then! Get out!

668
01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:45.196
- Go on!
- Stop it!


669
01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:48.608
I'd give you my
gun hand if I could.

670
01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:53.275
Yeah, I know you would, kid.

671
01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:59.683
Your hand and my eyes together, hm?

672
01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:06.692
It might work.

673
01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.457
You are crazy.

674
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.367
Probably, but I think we'd better find out.

675
01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:19.998
Little bit more. Whoa.
Right there.


676
01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:21.839
They way you're facing is 1 2 o'clock.

677
01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:24.039
Just listen for my voice.

678
01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:28.080
I'm going to 1 2 o'clock.

679
01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.448
Now just listen for it.

680
01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.578
I'm going to move around now.

681
01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.054
You pick it up.

682
01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.286
Three. Go.

683
01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.387
That's five.

684
01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:47.469
I tell ya, it won't work.

685
01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:49.232
You haven't given it a chance, Ben.

686
01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.638
Ain't nobody's going
to tell me when to draw.


687
01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.972
It's foolish, anyway.
I don't know where to shoot.


688
01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:56.901
It'll work. All you have to do

689
01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:58.413
is keep the clock in your head, Ben.

690
01:01:58.447 --> 01:02:00.039
That's all you see, is the clock.

691
01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:08.387
That's all you're watching,
is the clock.


692
01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.688
Let's try it again.

693
01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.557
Remember, you've only
got ten points to hit


694
01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:16.190
from five minutes before 1 2
until five minutes after 1 2.


695
01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.029
The way you're facing is 1 2 o'clock..

696
01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:20.092
I'm at 1 2 o'clock.

697
01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:24.338
OK, now I'm going
to move around the clock,


698
01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:28.400
You find me with your gun.

699
01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:30.275
I'm moving from minute to minute.

700
01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:38.113
Four.

701
01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.179
Go!

702
01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:42.450
That's better.

703
01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:50.197
Two.

704
01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.291
Go.

705
01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:01.966
Take your time, kid.

706
01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.610
58.

707
01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:07.809
Wait for my go!

708
01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.620
Just take your time.

709
01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.487
Take your time, Ben.
Take it easy.


710
01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.492
55.

711
01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:26.991
Go.

712
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.807
And another thing,

713
01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:34.139
we don't go unless we've
got our man on level ground.


714
01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:38.508
Well, how do we make sure of that?

715
01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.349
He'll come to us.
We'll have to pick the place.


716
01:03:45.187 --> 01:03:46.449
Three.

717
01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:47.717
Go.

718
01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.430
Right here, right here.

719
01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:58.558
Follow my voice.
That's 1 2. All right.


720
01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:05.001
I'll tell you what, kid.
Let's take a rest.


721
01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.339
- I hope we can--
- Now stop it. You're doing great.


722
01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:10.345
- It just don't feel right.
- Never mind how it feels.


723
01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.347
Just make sure you shoot straight.

724
01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.281
It's the damn clock.

725
01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:16.046
I can't see it.

726
01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.519
Put your hand on my shoulder.

727
01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:41.235
Now stick your right arm out.

728
01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:43.912
Do you know where you are?

729
01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:57.052
Not long ago you was one man
I had to prove myself against.


730
01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:59.561
Now I'm depending on you for my life.

731
01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:03.554
Well, there's a lot of things
we think we have to prove


732
01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:05.260
that don't need proving at all.

733
01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:06.768
Stick your right hand out.

734
01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.768
Thank you.

735
01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:14.607
How'd you get
to be a bounty hunter?


736
01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:21.606
Well, I guess I was doing
some proving of my own.


737
01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:24.609
It was a way of making a living,

738
01:05:24.653 --> 01:05:26.746
staying on the right side of the ledger.

739
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:29.451
That ain't exactly what I mean.

740
01:05:32.294 --> 01:05:36.424
- You know my story.
- I know your reputation.


741
01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:40.993
Why, everybody knows it,
but you don't seem to be such a...


742
01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:43.130
Such a what?

743
01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:46.802
Such a killer?

744
01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.306
You know what people are saying
about Benny Wallace?


745
01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.481
We was talking about you.

746
01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.986
Yeah, we sure was
talking about me, wasn't we?


747
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:06.589
Well, some kids are good
at breaking horses.


748
01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.120
Other kids are good at farming.

749
01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.998
I guess I was
kinda quick with my hands.

750
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:18.300
Pa let me strap on his.44 once.

751
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.173
When I was a kid, 
I did some practicing.

752
01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:26.376
A couple of years later,
a man gave me a reason to use it.


753
01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:32.712
Seems like somebody's
trying to lay me down ever since.


754
01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.954
Where's it all come out, Talion?

755
01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:42.357
Don't you know?

756
01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.671
We better get back to practicing.

757
01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.042
Stay still.

758
01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:35.315
It's me, kid.
Somebody paid us a call.


759
01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:36.716
Who was it?

760
01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:40.210
I can't tell, but chances are before the
day's out, lke Slant will know where we are.


761
01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:42.747
We're going to have to break camp
and make another one.


762
01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:48.054
I think I'm going to leave that clock.

763
01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.429
It'll give Slant
something to think about.


764
01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:10.076
Well, now ain't that a lot better?

765
01:08:10.119 --> 01:08:12.952
Got ourselves a little privacy.

766
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.723
Bri?

767
01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.124
Why don't you get me a bottle?

768
01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.029
Well?

769
01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:35.132
Here.

770
01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:37.304
That's more like it, old man.

771
01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:43.675
Well, what are you
yahoos a-gaping at?


772
01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:46.517
Ain't you ever seen a man
have a drink before?


773
01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:54.455
No, I reckon you ain't.

774
01:08:54.496 --> 01:08:57.693
There ain't a man
in the whole bunch.


775
01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.174
Why don't you bring me
my bottle, honey?


776
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:10.804
Ain't old lke good enough for ya?

777
01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:12.677
No!

778
01:09:12.715 --> 01:09:14.478
You got a lot of spunk!

779
01:09:14.516 --> 01:09:17.815
That's more than I can say
for the rest of this outfit.


780
01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:21.482
Hey, what else do
you know how to do?

781
01:09:21.523 --> 01:09:23.423
A couple of things.

782
01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:31.155
Ike, lke, I seen Talion and Wallace.

783
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.101
- Where?
- About a mile south of here.


784
01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.832
- How long ago?
- Yesterday.


785
01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.635
I taken all day.
I went to your shack first.


786
01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:41.268
Well, it looks like
I got a couple of things to do,


787
01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:45.041
but don't worry, honey,
I'm going to be back.


788
01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:47.945
All right.

789
01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:49.007
Four.

790
01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.040
Go.

791
01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:53.018
Damn it! That's three, kid, not four!

792
01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:56.183
I said four, not three. Four!

793
01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.659
Well, why don't you try it?

794
01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.355
Go ahead! Try it!

795
01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:03.194
Yeah, I know it's tough.

796
01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:06.395
Just get the picture of the clock
in your head. Just see the clock.


797
01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:08.936
All right. One.

798
01:10:08.971 --> 01:10:10.404
Go.

799
01:10:13.575 --> 01:10:16.339
Pat Garrett Jr. Stubborn Pat.

800
01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.869
What did you...

801
01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:20.882
You looked in my boot.

802
01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:22.781
You found out my name!

803
01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.910
Crazy.

804
01:10:25.954 --> 01:10:28.923
What the hell are you doing, kid?

805
01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.920
Don't you never call me
Pat Garrett, you hear?


806
01:10:34.963 --> 01:10:37.295
Never! Where are you?

807
01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:42.432
Where are you?

808
01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:46.768
What's the matter with you?
You out of your head?


809
01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:54.404
- Don't call me that name.
- Why not? That's your name, ain't it?


810
01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:57.977
Yes, it's my name.

811
01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.851
It's my old man's name.

812
01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:04.757
Pat Garrett, Sheriff, Fargo Wells.

813
01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:06.727
Well, what's that got--

814
01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.629
You got something
against sheriffs or something?


815
01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:13.066
I made more money bringing in one man
than he does bringing in five.


816
01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:16.367
And he says I'm wrong
for being a bounty hunter!


817
01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.469
Oh, I see.

818
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.345
It could be he's right, kid.

819
01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:28.282
How do you figure that?

820
01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:31.013
I think he's got something
that you and I ain't never gonna have.


821
01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:33.351
He's got one of these,
same as you and me.


822
01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:35.857
Outside of that tin star of yours.

823
01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.449
That tin star makes
all the difference in the world.


824
01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:38.790
He's the law, kid.

825
01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:40.124
You ain't ever gonna know
what that feels like.


826
01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.220
I don't need to.

827
01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:43.356
What did he get
for killing Billy the Kid?

828
01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:45.697
The most wanted man in the territory.

829
01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:48.567
i50 bucks a month, that's what he got.

830
01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:51.300
And he looks down on me.

831
01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.332
Kicked me out for being a bounty hunter,
that's what he did.


832
01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.503
Maybe inside you think he's right, huh?

833
01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:59.241
Maybe that's why you got so sore
when I called you Pat Garrett Jr.


834
01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:01.647
I told you not
to call me that name.

835
01:12:01.683 --> 01:12:03.412
I ain't gonna tell you no more.

836
01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:05.977
Will you grow up?

837
01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:08.512
If you don't like the name,
why do you wear it in your boots?


838
01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:12.152
Ain't hardly nobody outside
of you knows my real name.


839
01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:16.494
I kinda figured when it come
time to bury me I oughta...


840
01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:18.693
Well, he is my father.

841
01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.505
Hit in your marks.

842
01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:09.244
You don't have to be
in so much of a hurry if you hit the marks.


843
01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.910
Two. Go.

844
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.080
That's on it.

845
01:13:19.127 --> 01:13:22.255
One. Go.

846
01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.432
A little to the left,
but you would have had him.


847
01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:32.103
Four. Go.

848
01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:37.569
You were right on it, kid.

849
01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:39.774
Come on.
Let's take a rest.


850
01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:49.052
You keep it up just like you did,
right now we got nothing to worry about.


851
01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:51.389
I'm wondering how this thing
will work in action?


852
01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:54.589
Always seem to me,
what you don't expect is what you get.


853
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:56.097
Well, that works two ways.

854
01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:58.065
Ike Slant is going
to get something he doesn't expect.


855
01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:02.095
I'm going on in to Quince's.

856
01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:05.766
I think it might be a little bit smart
for us to find out what Slant's up to.


857
01:14:05.807 --> 01:14:08.605
You're probably right. Let's go.

858
01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:12.273
Well, I'd like the company, kid, but I might
have to leave there in a little bit of a hurry.


859
01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.440
I think I can
do that better by myself.

860
01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:16.280
You just keep out of sight.

861
01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.785
I should be back by midnight.

862
01:14:17.819 --> 01:14:21.277
- Don't push it too far.
- Not a chance.


863
01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:23.985
- Talion.
- Yeah?


864
01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.994
Why did Slant kill
your wife and boy?


865
01:14:30.832 --> 01:14:34.063
When I was bounty hunting,
I picked up $500 for his kid brother.


866
01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:52.112
Quince, pour me a drink.

867
01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:56.318
Hey, where's that pretty ol' gal of yours?

868
01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:59.327
You stay away from Bri, you hear?

869
01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:02.990
I reckon that'll be
up to me, won't it?

870
01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:05.522
And the next time
you bring me any information,


871
01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:07.899
you see it you get it here
in time to do me some good.


872
01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.904
Now what's the matter?
I thought we was friends.


873
01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.371
I ain't paying you to think.

874
01:15:11.406 --> 01:15:15.308
Anyhow, I ain't too sure
you didn't warn them two fellas.


875
01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.006
- I didn't even talk--
- Shut up.


876
01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:23.279
Hey, you ain't sorry that they didn't
bring me in on that trail board


877
01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:26.014
alongside of poor old
Charley and Jonas, are you?


878
01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:28.079
Let me tell you
something, Trumbull.


879
01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:31.251
There ain't nobody gonna
bring lke Slant in.


880
01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:33.887
Least of all a
blind man and a cripple.

881
01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:36.864
Now you listen to me, lke. I want you
to get this straight right here and--


882
01:15:36.898 --> 01:15:38.866
- Get out of here!
- All right.


883
01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:40.959
I don't want your company!

884
01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.239
What?

885
01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:56.341
You tell your friend
that Benny and me


886
01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.376
will meet him here
tomorrow at sundown.


887
01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.149
T omorrow at sundown.

888
01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:02.053
That's right, but I don't want
you to tell him right now.


889
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.216
When you leave here,

890
01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:06.125
you walk straight away
from the trading post.


891
01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:08.220
I can walk anywhere
you want me to walk.


892
01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:09.958
Goodbye.

893
01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.507
Talion!

894
01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:29.881
- Talion, Talion.
- What are you doing here?


895
01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:32.944
Well, I came to warn you.

896
01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:36.583
He knows. Slant, he knows.

897
01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:41.093
Well, you don't have to fight him.

898
01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:43.324
You can't fight him.

899
01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:45.663
Just calm down.

900
01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.795
You ought to be
getting some sleep.


901
01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:54.767
What was Trumbull doing here?

902
01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:58.643
He's delivering a message for me.

903
01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:01.813
Slant.

904
01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:08.278
Talion, I know why
you feel the way you do,


905
01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:12.453
and...I understand it.

906
01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.325
Well, couldn't you forget it?

907
01:17:14.362 --> 01:17:16.887
Couldn't you please forget it?

908
01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.832
No, no.

909
01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:23.494
It will all be over tomorrow, all right?

910
01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:28.335
T omorrow.

911
01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.703
Hey, kid, it's Talion.

912
01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:09.709
Been gone a long time.
What happened?


913
01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:17.883
- Slant's waiting for us.
- You saw him?


914
01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:23.692
Yeah, at Quince's.
He didn't see me. He was too busy.


915
01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:27.259
He was talking about a blind man
and a cripple, Ben.


916
01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:32.234
- When?
- Tomorrow at sundown.


917
01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:34.868
- At Quince's.
- At Quince's?


918
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:38.175
- You said he'd have to come to us.
- Yeah, he still will.


919
01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:43.277
I better get some rest.

920
01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:47.049
We'll leave about noon.
That will get us there on time.


921
01:19:06.107 --> 01:19:09.599
I guess tomorrow
we'll wind things up one way or another.


922
01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.812
We've been together
for quite a while now.


923
01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:20.254
I figure if things go OK tomorrow,

924
01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.222
we could stay together.

925
01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:30.787
A while, anyway.

926
01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:55.514
- Trumbull?
- What?


927
01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:01.955
- What do you want?
- I got a little chore for you.


928
01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:05.228
I don't understand you, lke.

929
01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:07.633
One minute you throw me out,

930
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.830
and the next minute
you got a chore for me.


931
01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:13.133
There's a bonus in it.

932
01:20:13.174 --> 01:20:16.507
Yeah? How much bonus?

933
01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:21.315
300 in gold...

934
01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.180
for nothing.

935
01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:30.984
300 in gold...

936
01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:34.455
for something.

937
01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:40.156
What do I have to do
to lay my hands on that kind of money?


938
01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:44.194
You know as well as I do
that they ain't gonna face me.


939
01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.501
How can they?

940
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.667
It didn't seem like Talion was fooling.

941
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:51.839
Well, I hope he does show up.

942
01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.680
I'll kill the both of them,
a couple of cripples.


943
01:20:55.717 --> 01:20:58.880
I just want to show
this whole stinkin' town


944
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.820
just what I can do to them two.

945
01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:02.516
I'll tell you what we'll do--

946
01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:05.151
If they do happen to ride in here...

947
01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:27.047
Is it about sundown?

948
01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:29.209
Yeah, just about.

949
01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:32.443
Talion, l'd...

950
01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:35.615
I'd like to ride in, like I could.

951
01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:39.722
Hell, yes, kid.

952
01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:41.251
Put your hand out.

953
01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:47.399
- All right?
- Yeah.


954
01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:52.372
Let's go. Come on.

955
01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:58.579
Duck your head.

956
01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:16.056
Two riders.

957
01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:17.962
It's them, all right.

958
01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:35.648
- Why, they're crazy.
- They stopped.


959
01:22:35.683 --> 01:22:37.617
Jo
-Hi, here.

960
01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:39.643
Stay under there, boy.

961
01:22:44.692 --> 01:22:46.159
Quarter to your left.

962
01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:50.654
Hold up.

963
01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:56.961
The fence is right in front of you.

964
01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:59.337
Just step down.
We're walking from here.


965
01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:13.345
Don't draw before I say go.

966
01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:18.353
I got to have time to get him
down on level ground.


967
01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:23.020
You're sure you'll know
when he's going to draw?


968
01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.665
Bad hand don't change
what a man knows.


969
01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:31.501
I'll keep giving ya his position.

970
01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:34.167
Don't get ahead of me.

971
01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.939
I'll give you plenty of time.

972
01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.707
Duck your horse's head.

973
01:23:38.746 --> 01:23:40.714
Come along the corral fence
to your right.


974
01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.378
Duck again. It's in the way.

975
01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.394
Just walk to your right.

976
01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.261
Turn to your left.

977
01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.998
A little further.

978
01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.201
Hold it.

979
01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.775
That's your 1 2 o'clock.

980
01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.486
Slant!

981
01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.796
Bri, get away from the window.

982
01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.124
Slant!

983
01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.846
Where is he, Talion?
What's happening?


984
01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:28.314
58 on the porch.

985
01:25:29.490 --> 01:25:34.189
Well, you two cripples
gonna talk all day?


986
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:36.959
You made an awful mistake riding in here.

987
01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:40.832
I'll guarantee ya,
you ain't gonna leave this town alive.


988
01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:44.835
What's holding you back, boys?

989
01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:52.177
59.

990
01:25:56.217 --> 01:25:57.514
57.

991
01:26:04.759 --> 01:26:06.317
55.

992
01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:08.829
Don't move.

993
01:26:08.863 --> 01:26:10.888
He's still on the porch.

994
01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:13.366
How are you going
to get him down?


995
01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:19.169
I'm not.

996
01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:22.404
He'll make his own
mistake before long.


997
01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:25.207
You two just going
to stand there?


998
01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:33.949
He's coming down.

999
01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.068
54.

1000
01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.504
52.

1001
01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:57.602
He's off your clock now.

1002
01:26:57.645 --> 01:26:59.943
Should we make a new 1 2?

1003
01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:02.415
Nah, he'll come back into it.

1004
01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.246
55.

1005
01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:13.419
58.

1006
01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:17.420
He's on 1 2.

1007
01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:21.064
One minute after.

1008
01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:22.535
Two.

1009
01:27:28.843 --> 01:27:30.504
He's got a notion.

1010
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.342
No, not quite.

1011
01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:40.479
It's gonna be a real
pleasure killing you two.


1012
01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:45.015
A blind man and a cripple, lke?

1013
01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:46.549
Yeah.

1014
01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:48.619
Two.

1015
01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:51.458
Benny...Go!

1016
01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:08.443
Jo
-Hi!

1017
01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:10.246
No!

1018
01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:14.013
You all right, Mr. Talion?

1019
01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:18.652
Yeah, I'm all right, Jo
-Hi.

1020
01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:09.339
Mr. Quince?

1021
01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:12.540
Will you take care of him for me?

1022
01:29:32.099 --> 01:29:36.559
For the marker, his name
is Pat Garrett Jr.


1023
01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:54.920
Talion?

1024
01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:05.122
Where are you a-going?

1025
01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:09.561
Bri, this gun killed my wife,

1026
01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:12.596
it killed my son,
it killed that boy over there.


1027
01:30:16.277 --> 01:30:18.609
It ain't gonna kill you, too.

1028
01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.486
Come here, Dolly.

1029
01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:32.425
- Mr. Talion!
- Yeah, Jo-Hi?


1030
01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.690
I want you
to stay, Mr. Talion,


1031
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.789
but I guess you gotta go.

1032
01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:41.290
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Did you forget my gun?


1033
01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:45.130
Yeah, I'm afraid I did, Jo
-Hi.

1034
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:52.302
Jo
-Hi, come here.

1035
01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.582
The same as yours.

1036
01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:05.649
Yeah.

1037
01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:07.991
It's just littler.
