00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.291
Good girl.

55
00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:42.756
You're gonna take all your stuffed animals

56
00:03:42.757 --> 00:03:44.174

Good girl.

67
00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:15.414
Jesus, B, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.


68
00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:18.000
Beatrice always makes it.

69
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:20.170
Just had to put on my traveling face.

70
00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:23.505
Well, that was a mighty short notice.

71
00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:25.340
Well, the bus leaves in 30 minutes.

72
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:26.259
So?

73
00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.218
Lisa?

74
00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.510
B is here.

75
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.345
Hi, B.

76
00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:31.513
You miss one bus she
sure can catch another.


77
00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:33.599
I don’t have time to
waste waiting for a bus.


78
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.893
Not tonight, B.

79
00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:39.314
Aren't you gonna answer?

80
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:45.861
Lisa?

81
00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:47.739
It's Ginger.

82
00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:48.573
Hold on, Ginger.

83
00:04:48.574 --> 00:04:49.615
B, take her on out to the cab.

84
00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:51.366
I'll be out in a couple of seconds.

85
00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:52.744
Ging, what is it?

86
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.370
I split on Ramrod.

87
00:04:56.748 --> 00:04:58.832
How's my little princess?

88
00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:01.044
Please, B, I asked you
never to call her that.


89
00:05:02.212 --> 00:05:03.504
Oh, I'm sorry.

90
00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:06.548
Ginger, what's wrong?

91
00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:07.549
I ran out on him.

92
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.594
I couldn't take it.

93
00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:11.887
He beat the shit out of me.

94
00:05:11.888 --> 00:05:13.348
I can't handle it anymore.

95
00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:15.515
Ginger, where are you?

96
00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:17.893
I'm at the Hollywood Sunset Motel.

97
00:05:17.894 --> 00:05:20.187
Oh, Jesus, he'll find
you there for sure.


98
00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:21.648
I held out on him.

99
00:05:22.607 --> 00:05:24.024
500 bucks.

100
00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:26.526
Ginger, for Christ's
sakes, listen to me.


101
00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:27.736
Bolt the door, right now.

102
00:05:27.737 --> 00:05:29.655

103
00:05:29.656 --> 00:05:30.989
I gotta go see Walsh at nine

104
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.200

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.868
Promise?

106
00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:36.579

Do I look like a cop to you?

150
00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:32.087
Does the teddy bear have cotton balls?

151
00:08:32.088 --> 00:08:34.047
Get lost, huh?

152
00:08:34.048 --> 00:08:35.675
But you're pretty cute for a cop.

153

00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:20.219
Um, what will $50 get me?

Well, a whole lot of pleasure.

00:09:27.727 --> 00:09:29.853
Have you ever golden showered?

162
00:09:29.854 --> 00:09:32.314
I mean it doesn't hurt or anything.

163
00:09:32.315 --> 00:09:34.608

173
00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:41.675
Motherfucker, I said 50.

174
00:10:41.676 --> 00:10:42.510
50?

175
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.510
50!

176
00:10:56.983 --> 00:10:57.817
Who is it?

177
00:10:57.818 --> 00:11:00.318
It's God almighty, that's who it is.

178
00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:01.361
Come on, baby.

179
00:11:01.362 --> 00:11:02.780
Open up the door.

180
00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:08.827
I ain't letting you in, you prick.

181
00:11:08.828 --> 00:11:11.163
Ginger, don't talk to me that way.

182
00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:15.793
You're gonna hit me again?

183
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.797
Well, you know, you're the
number one thing in my heart.


184
00:11:20.923 --> 00:11:21.841
Come on, baby.

185
00:11:21.842 --> 00:11:22.842
Open up the door.

186
00:11:22.843 --> 00:11:24.093
I'm out here all alone.

187
00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:28.346
I ain't letting
you beat my ass to the floor.


188
00:11:28.347 --> 00:11:32.976
Honey, all I wanna
do, is just love you.

189
00:11:32.977 --> 00:11:35.520
You hurt me bad, Ramrod.

190
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:36.689
I know I did.

191
00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:40.483
But that's 'cause I thought
you was holding out on me.


192
00:11:40.484 --> 00:11:42.111
I should have known better.

193
00:11:43.237 --> 00:11:45.740
I should have known you
wouldn't do a thing like that.


194
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.909
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.287
Baby, I'm sorry.

196
00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:54.749
I ain't never gonna hit you.

197
00:11:56.667 --> 00:11:59.962
All I wanna do is give you
the kind of love you want.


198
00:12:01.047 --> 00:12:02.173
What you need.

199
00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:06.469
Open the door, Ginger.

200
00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:09.430
You swear you ain't gonna hit me again?

201
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.309
That's right.

202
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.187
Ginger, open the door.

203
00:12:17.229 --> 00:12:18.064
Come on.

204
00:12:18.064 --> 00:12:19.064
Open the door.

205
00:12:26.656 --> 00:12:28.658
I cannot believe how stupid you are.

206
00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:32.328
Ungrateful fucking bitch.

207
00:12:34.205 --> 00:12:35.622
I took care of you, didn't I?

208
00:12:35.623 --> 00:12:36.499
Didn't I?

209
00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:37.333
Answer me.

210
00:12:37.334 --> 00:12:38.574
Didn't I take care of you, huh?

211
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.252
I'm the one who found
you at the bus station


212
00:12:41.253 --> 00:12:43.630
half starving to death.

213
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:45.173
I'm the one who taught
you to put your hair up,


214
00:12:45.174 --> 00:12:46.467
put your makeup on just right,

215
00:12:47.885 --> 00:12:50.053
so you could have any John you want.

216
00:12:50.054 --> 00:12:52.348
How did you pay me back, huh?

217
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:55.433
How did you pay me back, Ginger?

218
00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:56.434
Don't move!

219
00:12:57.228 --> 00:12:59.021
Don't move.

220
00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:02.774
How did you pay me back, huh?

221
00:13:02.775 --> 00:13:04.318
You don't hold out on me.

222
00:13:10.908 --> 00:13:13.451
I love you, Ramrod.

223
00:13:13.452 --> 00:13:14.286
What?

224
00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:15.204
You love me?

225
00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:16.913
You love me.

226
00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:18.541
See, I love you, too, Ginger.

227
00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:21.209
I really do.

228
00:13:24.296 --> 00:13:27.882
But you know what, Ginger,
the street talk has it that


229
00:13:27.883 --> 00:13:29.217
you're thinking about
turning outlaw on me.


230
00:13:29.218 --> 00:13:31.803
Now suppose you tell me
that’s not true, all right.


231
00:13:31.804 --> 00:13:33.805
I swear I won't leave you, Ram.

232
00:13:33.806 --> 00:13:35.306
You swear.

233
00:13:35.307 --> 00:13:37.268
You swear to God, hmm?

234
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:40.437
Oh, yeah.

235
00:13:40.438 --> 00:13:41.272
You bet your sweet ass.

236
00:13:41.272 --> 00:13:42.272
You ain't leaving me.

237
00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:45.860
You don't leave until I say so.

238
00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:04.419
I mean, you know
what I got to do.

239
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.797
God, I gotta help you get
your act back together.


240
00:14:07.798 --> 00:14:09.008
What am I supposed to do?

241
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760
Hmm.

242
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.263
You see, Miss Ginger,

243
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.892
what you've got to do,
is you got to learn

244
00:14:18.893 --> 00:14:21.479
that nobody ever walks out on me.

245
00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:23.397
You understand me?

246
00:14:23.398 --> 00:14:24.898
Never!

247
00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:26.776
They never walk out on me.

248
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.740
And you and me,

249
00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:38.913
you and me, baby, we're gonna
go on helping each other,


250
00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:45.961
till I say we don't need
to help each other no more.


251
00:14:47.755 --> 00:14:49.355
When you've learned that lesson, Ginger,

252
00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:53.260
you're gonna feel so good.

253
00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.764
I mean, you'll feel happy about yourself.

254
00:14:57.765 --> 00:15:00.225
You know what I mean, hmm?

255
00:15:00.226 --> 00:15:02.353
Now you look at me when
I'm talking to you.


256
00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:09.276
Do you know what time it is?

257
00:15:11.487 --> 00:15:12.487
It's school time.

258
00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:18.118
You ain’t gonna be able to
give my money maker away


259
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.370
for quite a while.

260
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.961
Lesson number one, Ginger.

261
00:15:32.049 --> 00:15:33.258
Six Abel seven,

262
00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:37.262
at 546 E, 327 North Hayward.

263
00:15:37.263 --> 00:15:38.304
You're all clear six Victor 10.

264
00:15:38.305 --> 00:15:39.305
No messages.

265
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.900
Ah,

266
00:15:53.487 --> 00:15:54.696
okay, sergeant.

267
00:15:54.697 --> 00:15:56.156
Let me run through this again.

268
00:15:57.324 --> 00:15:59.201
Now, agreed, it's up the ass, right?

269
00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:02.204
Around the world, that's,

270
00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:05.832
fuck and suck.

271
00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:06.667
No, no, no.

272
00:16:06.668 --> 00:16:08.459
Edwards, that's half-and-half.

273
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.420
Right, man, right.

274
00:16:09.421 --> 00:16:10.461
I got it.

275
00:16:10.462 --> 00:16:15.301
A golden shower is a freak
who likes to get pissed on.


276
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:18.595
Right?

277
00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:20.179
Mmm-hmm.

278
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.348
Sick.

279
00:16:22.766 --> 00:16:23.601
Whoo, man.

280
00:16:23.602 --> 00:16:25.143
That is sick.

281
00:16:25.144 --> 00:16:27.478
Yeah, well, we ain't out
here writing traffic citations.


282
00:16:27.479 --> 00:16:30.940
And Edwards, few words of advice,
you better get used to it.


283
00:16:30.941 --> 00:16:32.191
Did you pay to have that done?

284
00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:33.027
What?

285
00:16:33.027 --> 00:16:33.861
Your...

286
00:16:33.862 --> 00:16:34.944
- My cornrows?
- Yeah.


287
00:16:34.945 --> 00:16:35.987
Of course, man.

288
00:16:35.988 --> 00:16:36.822
Yeah?

289
00:16:36.822 --> 00:16:37.822
How much?

290
00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:41.743
How much, huh?

291
00:16:41.744 --> 00:16:42.827
What's the matter, sergeant?

292
00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:44.078
You don't like my cornrows?

293
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:44.914
Yeah, I like your cornrows.

294
00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:45.997
Hold on.

295
00:16:45.998 --> 00:16:47.707
We got ourselves a customer here now.

296
00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:48.542
Okay, my friend.

297
00:16:48.543 --> 00:16:50.293
We're gonna pop your cherry.

298
00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:51.961
You go out and bring that
little hooker over here.


299
00:16:51.962 --> 00:16:54.339
Sergeant, I've been working
with this Jamaican accent.


300
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.673
Can I use it now?

301
00:16:55.674 --> 00:16:56.508
Yeah.

302
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:58.176
Yeah, use your Jamaican accent.

303
00:16:58.177 --> 00:16:59.719
All right, sergeant, man.

304
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.642
Ha-ha.

305
00:17:41.971 --> 00:17:43.054
Hi, officer.

306
00:17:43.055 --> 00:17:44.722
What can I do for you?

307
00:17:44.723 --> 00:17:45.557
Hey, man.

308
00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:47.058
You think I'm a cop?

309
00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:49.936
Just saying the word make me nervous.

310
00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:50.937
Hold on.

311
00:17:53.023 --> 00:17:54.023
You want to party?

312
00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:57.735
Eh, I think maybe
you want to party, huh?


313
00:17:57.736 --> 00:17:59.530
Especially with a pretty boy like me.

314
00:18:01.156 --> 00:18:01.991
You like my hair?

315
00:18:01.992 --> 00:18:03.283
I like your smile.

316
00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:06.787
So how much you
wanna spend for it, baby?

317
00:18:07.913 --> 00:18:09.497
$35?

318
00:18:09.498 --> 00:18:11.249
That'll get you some real good head.

319
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.250
How about that?

320
00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:14.085
That's fine.

321
00:18:15.212 --> 00:18:16.212
Hi, Blue Chip.

322
00:18:17.548 --> 00:18:18.424
Well, well.

323
00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:19.549
If it isn't Mr. Pussycuffs.

324
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.551
That's me.

325
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.219
Listen, man, you ain't
gonna hang no snatch


326
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.138
and grab on me.

327
00:18:24.139 --> 00:18:26.305
I didn't give him an offer.

328
00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:28.891
Well, you gotta forgive
the boy because he's new.


329
00:18:28.892 --> 00:18:31.269
He didn't know that you were
talking about sucking eggs.


330
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.270
Shit.

331
00:18:33.272 --> 00:18:34.272
Come on, move it.

332
00:18:41.155 --> 00:18:42.822
Man, I'm gonna tell you again, man.

333
00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:44.615
I am a pimp.

334
00:18:44.616 --> 00:18:45.783
You understand what I'm saying, man?

335
00:18:45.784 --> 00:18:46.744
Just ask my lady there, man.

336
00:18:46.744 --> 00:18:47.578
She'll tell you.

337
00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:49.704
I ain't no god damn, jive
ass dope dealer either.


338
00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:50.705
I am a pimp.

339
00:18:54.752 --> 00:18:55.960
I swear to God, officer.

340
00:18:55.961 --> 00:18:57.795
I was not trying to grope that man.

341
00:18:57.796 --> 00:18:59.881
I mean, it was an honest mistake.

342
00:18:59.882 --> 00:19:03.593
I was merely trying to dust
the ashes off his pants.


343
00:19:03.594 --> 00:19:07.055
Gregory, Gregory, that's what
you said last week, sweetie.


344
00:19:07.056 --> 00:19:08.431
Oh, shit.

345
00:19:08.432 --> 00:19:11.851
Well, can't blame a girl for trying.

346
00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:13.478
Hey, Lou, come over
here and get this bum


347
00:19:13.479 --> 00:19:15.354
out of my face, huh?

348
00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:17.732
Hey, who belongs to these two whores?

349
00:19:17.733 --> 00:19:20.736
We ain't no whores, Mr. 
Hunky Policeman.

350
00:19:21.945 --> 00:19:22.945
We're prostitutes.

351
00:19:22.946 --> 00:19:23.906
There's a difference?

352
00:19:23.907 --> 00:19:25.907
Whores give it away.

353
00:19:25.908 --> 00:19:27.117
Stupid.

354
00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:36.000
Hey, wasn't somebody supposed to

355
00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:37.418
take this kid to juvenile?

356
00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:40.505
What the fuck makes you
think I wanna go to juvenile.


357
00:19:40.506 --> 00:19:42.882
You think you're tough, don't you, kid?

358
00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:44.468
We'll see how tough you are.

359
00:19:52.184 --> 00:19:53.018
No!

360
00:19:53.019 --> 00:19:55.354
Somebody stole my goddamn paper clips.

361
00:19:57.022 --> 00:19:59.816
Who in the fuck took my paper clips?

362
00:19:59.817 --> 00:20:01.234
Every time you bring something

363
00:20:01.235 --> 00:20:03.861
to this fucking slime
pit, you can't find shit.


364
00:20:03.862 --> 00:20:06.739
Now somebody stole my goddamn paper clips.

365
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.366
Those were my paper clips.

366
00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:10.409
My paper clips.

367
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.621
Maybe it's time for Mace
to be put out to pasture?


368
00:20:13.622 --> 00:20:17.041
Maybe it's time for all of
us to be put out to pasture.


369
00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:21.170
Hey, may I have some paper
for my girlfriend here?


370
00:20:21.171 --> 00:20:22.672
Hey, Walsh?

371
00:20:22.673 --> 00:20:25.716
Walsh, they want you down
at County Bay immediately.


372
00:20:25.717 --> 00:20:27.176
They said it was important.

373
00:20:27.177 --> 00:20:30.222
Hey, Mendez, process
Edwards’ girlfriend for him.


374
00:20:33.684 --> 00:20:34.518
Six Victor 10.

375
00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:35.643
Regarding your meet at County med.

376
00:20:35.644 --> 00:20:36.936
It's with a Ginger Grady.

377
00:20:36.937 --> 00:20:39.063
We've been advised to make
that a code two and a half.


378
00:20:39.064 --> 00:20:40.189
Six Victor 10.

379
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.233
Roger central.

380
00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:00.459
How do you know she was a hooker?

381
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.878
Vaginal mutilation.

382
00:21:01.879 --> 00:21:03.171
It's not uncommon with prostitutes.

383
00:21:03.172 --> 00:21:04.338
A pimp stick?

384
00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:05.590
No question about it.

385
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:07.300
How the hell did she get here?

386
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:08.467
She arrived in a taxi.

387
00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:09.468
Walsh,

388
00:21:13.932 --> 00:21:15.308
is that you?

389
00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:16.143
Yeah, Ginger.

390
00:21:16.143 --> 00:21:16.977
That's me.

391
00:21:16.978 --> 00:21:18.353
You tell me the truth now.

392
00:21:19.354 --> 00:21:20.772
Ramrod did this to you.

393
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.983
It was Ramrod wasn't it?

394
00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:25.401
Huh?

395
00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:26.402
No.

396
00:21:29.573 --> 00:21:31.199
He loves me.

397
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.994
That stoned psycho doesn't love anybody.

398
00:21:37.664 --> 00:21:39.291
What if you don't make it, huh?

399
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.337
I'm gonna make it.

400
00:21:53.222 --> 00:21:54.681
I don't wanna die.

401
00:21:56.433 --> 00:21:57.476
Easy, easy.

402
00:22:55.117 --> 00:22:57.576
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch

403
00:22:57.577 --> 00:22:59.204
if it's the last thing I ever do.

404
00:23:00.914 --> 00:23:02.916
Not on that death bed
statement you won't.


405
00:23:04.459 --> 00:23:06.210
Mendez called, he said Princess

406
00:23:06.211 --> 00:23:08.130
is waiting for you down at the station.

407
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.093
You have her brought here.

408
00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:26.981
Code
blue, fourth floor, bed one.


409
00:23:26.982 --> 00:23:33.030
Code blue, fourth floor, bed one.

410
00:23:34.906 --> 00:23:35.990
Staff meeting.

411
00:23:35.991 --> 00:23:37.743
All doctors report to room 11.

412
00:23:58.597 --> 00:23:59.431
What is this?

413
00:23:59.432 --> 00:24:01.223
Some kind of a joke?

414
00:24:01.224 --> 00:24:02.224
Hmm?

415
00:24:03.226 --> 00:24:04.852
I'm not talking business
near zombies of yours.


416
00:24:04.853 --> 00:24:07.688
Do you wanna talk a deal, huh?

417
00:24:07.689 --> 00:24:09.440
We talk right now, right here

418
00:24:09.441 --> 00:24:13.236
because I don't have time to
fuck around with you, Princess.


419
00:24:15.405 --> 00:24:17.031
Well, this is a hell
of a way for anyone

420
00:24:17.032 --> 00:24:18.908
to get their cookies off.

421
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:21.078
Listen, you're over
your head, sweetheart.


422
00:24:22.079 --> 00:24:24.414
That drug bust of yours
is good for three to 10.


423
00:24:27.167 --> 00:24:28.751
Come on, Walsh.

424
00:24:28.752 --> 00:24:30.128
Get off my back.

425
00:24:32.255 --> 00:24:33.965
You know I don't use dope, Walsh.

426
00:24:35.717 --> 00:24:37.093
So why don't you just lighten up.

427
00:24:37.094 --> 00:24:38.928
You don't have to sell me, baby.

428
00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:40.179
I know you don't use dope.

429
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.014
I know it.

430
00:24:41.015 --> 00:24:44.100
But you see, the judge, he doesn't know.

431
00:24:44.101 --> 00:24:45.893
You want me to lighten up?

432
00:24:45.894 --> 00:24:47.436
Okay, how is this?

433
00:24:47.437 --> 00:24:50.272
You go to trial and you lose.

434
00:24:50.273 --> 00:24:52.400
And you will lose.

435
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:54.318
That judge is gonna take
one look at your rap sheet


436
00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:56.028
and he's gonna dump all over you.

437
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:57.321
And your daughter, your little daughter.

438
00:24:57.322 --> 00:24:58.447
What's her name?

439
00:24:58.448 --> 00:25:00.658
What, that beautiful little
girl, little blonde girl.


440
00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:02.368
What's her name?

441
00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:03.369
Huh?

442
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.204
What is it?

443
00:25:04.205 --> 00:25:05.496
Lisa, isn't it?

444
00:25:05.497 --> 00:25:06.331
Huh?

445
00:25:06.331 --> 00:25:07.165
Lisa.

446
00:25:07.165 --> 00:25:07.999
Lisa, right.

447
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.418
Let me tell you something.

448
00:25:10.419 --> 00:25:13.421
She will be out turning tricks

449
00:25:13.422 --> 00:25:15.340
before you see daylight again.

450
00:25:17.426 --> 00:25:19.052
How badly do you wanna break?

451
00:25:31.106 --> 00:25:32.731
Okay, Walsh.

452
00:25:32.732 --> 00:25:35.151
Let’s get past the shit, all right?

453
00:25:35.152 --> 00:25:37.070
Just tell me what
you got on your mind.

454
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.490
I want you to operate a pimp

455
00:25:42.701 --> 00:25:43.785
by the name of Ramrod.

456
00:25:46.204 --> 00:25:49.498
Go put sand up your ass, Walsh.

457
00:25:49.499 --> 00:25:52.001
Do you know what that psycho
son of a bitch gets off on?


458
00:25:52.002 --> 00:25:54.044
He gets off on cutting up girls.

459
00:25:54.045 --> 00:25:56.506
And with your help
we could put him away.


460
00:25:58.216 --> 00:26:01.385
You got big balls, Walsh.

461
00:26:01.386 --> 00:26:02.721
You know I got a kid.

462
00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:06.724
What's she gonna do if that
snake trusses me up to some bed?


463
00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:07.975
You don't have any choice.

464
00:26:07.976 --> 00:26:08.976
It's either this or the slammer.

465
00:26:08.977 --> 00:26:10.102
And personally, lady,

466
00:26:10.103 --> 00:26:13.106
I don't think you can handle the time.

467
00:26:13.982 --> 00:26:15.567
Well, I could stay alive, man.

468
00:26:16.902 --> 00:26:19.654
24 hours after he’s in, he's out.

469
00:26:20.614 --> 00:26:22.573
That's no fucking jail
you're operating there.


470
00:26:22.574 --> 00:26:24.658
It's a hotel with a revolving door.

471
00:26:24.659 --> 00:26:26.202
I don't need some fucking bimbo

472
00:26:26.203 --> 00:26:28.413
telling me what's wrong with the system.

473
00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:31.958
You know what you can do

474
00:26:31.958 --> 00:26:32.958
with your system, honey?

475
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.966
What about Ginger Grady?

476
00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:42.677
She's a friend of yours, isn't she?

477
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.929
Huh?

478
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:45.764
You know we're tight.

479
00:26:45.765 --> 00:26:47.974
You got a dope bust on
me for carrying her shit.


480
00:26:48.975 --> 00:26:52.686
Well, would you do it
if she talked to you?


481
00:26:52.687 --> 00:26:53.522
Huh?

482
00:26:53.523 --> 00:26:54.802
What did you do, bust her too?

483
00:26:55.398 --> 00:26:57.817
No, not exactly, but I think
she wants to talk to you.


484
00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:00.195
Look at her, Princess.

485
00:27:00.195 --> 00:27:01.029
Listen to her.

486
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.863
Listen to her real good.

487
00:27:01.864 --> 00:27:03.030
Ramrod did that to her.

488
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:03.865
He beat the shit out of her.

489
00:27:03.866 --> 00:27:05.867
And he used a pimp stick on her.

490
00:27:10.705 --> 00:27:13.250
You face him, fucking coward.

491
00:27:14.751 --> 00:27:15.710
What's the matter with you?

492
00:27:15.711 --> 00:27:16.835
Don't you care?

493
00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:17.754
All you is sit around all day saying,

494
00:27:17.754 --> 00:27:18.588
"He beat me, beat me."

495
00:27:18.589 --> 00:27:21.883
How are we supposed to protect
if you don’t let us help you?


496
00:27:29.307 --> 00:27:31.100
Look, look at her.

497
00:27:31.101 --> 00:27:33.602
Look at her, Princess.

498
00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:34.603

Mmm-mmm.

510
00:28:31.495 --> 00:28:32.911
Where’s your date at?

511
00:28:32.912 --> 00:28:34.079
Do you know that
if beauty was a minute,

512
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.540
mama, you’d be an hour.

513
00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:39.084
Hey, bitch, don’t you hear
me talking to you, huh?


514
00:28:39.085 --> 00:28:39.919
I'm talking to you.

515
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.170
I mean, you know who I am?

516
00:28:41.171 --> 00:28:42.254
Maybe you don’t know who I am.

517
00:28:42.255 --> 00:28:43.922
Maybe I should run it down to you

518
00:28:43.923 --> 00:28:45.257
so you know who I am.

519
00:28:45.258 --> 00:28:46.217
Baby, I’m the best...

520
00:28:46.218 --> 00:28:47.635
Fuck off.

521
00:28:47.636 --> 00:28:50.054
Man, you’re a cold mama.

522
00:28:50.055 --> 00:28:52.431
What’s your problem?

523
00:28:52.432 --> 00:28:54.643
Who's the bitch?

524
00:29:06.154 --> 00:29:07.321
What’s the matter, sergeant?

525
00:29:07.322 --> 00:29:08.198
She’s nervous.

526
00:29:08.199 --> 00:29:09.990
She’s scared, man.

527
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:13.370
If he makes her
as a setup, she’s dead.

528
00:29:14.496 --> 00:29:16.956
Hello there, beautiful lady.

529
00:29:17.874 --> 00:29:21.377
What do you say
I buy you a drink?

530
00:29:21.378 --> 00:29:23.587
I can buy my own, cowboy.

531
00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:24.422
Now, come on.

532
00:29:24.423 --> 00:29:25.756
Don't be un-neighborly.

533
00:29:25.757 --> 00:29:28.467
I’m just trying to be
friendly, do you understand?


534
00:29:28.468 --> 00:29:30.053
Strike up a little conversation.

535
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.683
Well, you’re doing all
the talking, handsome man.


536
00:29:39.312 --> 00:29:42.023
Now, it appears to me
that you're flying solo.


537
00:29:43.483 --> 00:29:46.318
And it also appears to me that
what you need is a good man,


538
00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:49.697
just somebody to take
care of you, am I right?


539
00:29:49.698 --> 00:29:50.782
Am I right, hmm?

540
00:29:52.283 --> 00:29:55.328
Do you think you can
give me what I need, huh?


541
00:29:56.663 --> 00:29:58.540
I don’t give nothing.

542
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:02.543
But then, if you’re choosing me

543
00:30:02.544 --> 00:30:05.672
well, I just have to see your
qualifications, wouldn’t I?


544
00:30:06.589 --> 00:30:07.589
Huh?

545
00:30:08.633 --> 00:30:11.219
I ain’t never heard no
man of mine complain before.


546
00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:14.097
I could be a cop, couldn’t I?

547
00:30:15.974 --> 00:30:17.225
And I could be a virgin.

548
00:30:19.561 --> 00:30:20.687
Ooh, I wish.

549
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.733
You’ve got style, baby.

550
00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:27.901
But if I’m gonna take your application,

551
00:30:27.902 --> 00:30:29.445
you and I, we should go someplace else

552
00:30:29.446 --> 00:30:30.321
where it's a real quiet.

553
00:30:30.322 --> 00:30:31.822
We talk.

554
00:30:31.823 --> 00:30:33.283
What do you think?

555
00:30:34.284 --> 00:30:36.034
What have you got in mind?

556
00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:37.035
Home.

557
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.539
See, I got this beautiful little apartment

558
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.207
where I take care of you.

559
00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:43.584
Do you understand?

560
00:30:43.585 --> 00:30:44.461
Understand?

561
00:30:44.462 --> 00:30:46.170
Do you like that shit?

562
00:30:46.171 --> 00:30:47.714
You like that shit, bitch?

563
00:30:50.133 --> 00:30:51.133
I like it.

564
00:30:52.677 --> 00:30:54.137
Such a wild thing.

565
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.597
Come with me, all right?

566
00:30:56.598 --> 00:30:58.056
Come on.

567
00:30:58.057 --> 00:30:59.100

Suspect and friendly, are
headed to your location.


590
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.917

because they’re only seconds away.

Boy in position.

596
00:33:11.441 --> 00:33:13.276
So they call you The Princess.

597
00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:16.529
Yes, uh, that works for me.

598
00:33:27.498 --> 00:33:28.583

Suspect and friendly have
entered the elevator.


601
00:33:45.934 --> 00:33:48.602
So how long you’ve
been in the life, Princess?


602
00:33:48.603 --> 00:33:50.187
Five years, Christmas Eve.

603
00:33:50.188 --> 00:33:52.148
Had to hit the
streets to make a living.

604
00:33:53.358 --> 00:33:55.777
Well, why should you be different, huh?

605
00:34:05.745 --> 00:34:06.745
Mmm.

606
00:34:10.416 --> 00:34:12.043

607

608
00:34:14.963 --> 00:34:15.963

609
00:34:15.964 --> 00:34:16.964
I got it.

610
00:34:17.715 --> 00:34:18.715
What do you say?

611
00:34:20.343 --> 00:34:25.055
I’ll make a little drink and
then you show me what you got?

00:34:25.056 --> 00:34:27.141
Off with the dress, huh?

613
00:34:48.037 --> 00:34:49.956
How come you don’t have no main lady?

614
00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:53.418
How come I don’t got no main lady?

615
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.086
It’s because she held out on me

616
00:34:56.087 --> 00:35:00.007
and I just had
to fire the lazy bitch.

617
00:35:00.008 --> 00:35:01.009
You know what I mean?

618
00:35:06.305 --> 00:35:07.598

619
00:35:10.935 --> 00:35:11.936

662

Warrants?

663

fucking little trash.

666
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.690
Check the bedroom.

667
00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:08.278
Put your hands on your head.

668
00:38:08.279 --> 00:38:09.197
Hey, cop, come on.

669
00:38:09.198 --> 00:38:10.322
Shoot me.

670
00:38:10.323 --> 00:38:11.740
That can be arranged.

671
00:38:11.741 --> 00:38:13.618
Oh, I’ll bet it can.

672
00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:15.619
Come on, take him.

673
00:38:17.205 --> 00:38:19.873
Nobody got the
fucking minority report.


674
00:38:19.874 --> 00:38:21.958
Say, didn’t I see you
picking lettuce in Salinas.


675
00:38:21.959 --> 00:38:22.793
Come on, come on.

676
00:38:22.794 --> 00:38:24.628
Are you okay, huh?

677
00:38:24.629 --> 00:38:25.795
I’ll make it.

678
00:38:25.796 --> 00:38:26.631
Here.

679
00:38:26.631 --> 00:38:27.465
Now, I’m very ticklish.

680
00:38:27.465 --> 00:38:28.465
Come on.

681
00:38:29.342 --> 00:38:31.426
You're getting off down there, cop, huh?

682
00:38:31.427 --> 00:38:32.803
You’re getting off, motherfucker.

683
00:38:35.723 --> 00:38:36.891
You see this, asshole?

684
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.435
They’ve recorded everything we said.

685
00:38:40.436 --> 00:38:44.190
Your ass is on this tape
now and it’s about this big.


686
00:38:45.691 --> 00:38:48.110
Well, you’re gonna pay for
what you did to Ginger.


687
00:38:49.237 --> 00:38:52.697
What I did to Ginger
is knock her around.


688
00:38:52.698 --> 00:38:54.449
So what, bitch?

689
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.284
Mess around...

690
00:38:55.284 --> 00:38:56.160
Fucking asshole.

691
00:38:56.161 --> 00:38:58.037
She's dead, you dumb fuck!

692
00:39:00.248 --> 00:39:01.331
She’s dead, huh?

693
00:39:01.332 --> 00:39:02.166
Yeah.

694
00:39:02.167 --> 00:39:03.960
They set me up, huh?

695
00:39:06.796 --> 00:39:09.339
Nobody sets me up, you understand?

696
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.674
Nobody!

697
00:39:10.675 --> 00:39:12.092
Come on, shoot!

698
00:39:12.093 --> 00:39:12.927
Come on, cop.

699
00:39:12.927 --> 00:39:13.761
Shoot!

700
00:39:13.761 --> 00:39:14.595
No!

701
00:39:14.596 --> 00:39:15.762
Come on, kill me, come on.

702
00:39:15.763 --> 00:39:18.265
Mendez, Kowalski,
where are you guys?


703
00:39:18.266 --> 00:39:20.100
She’s dead, fuckhead.

704
00:39:20.101 --> 00:39:20.935
Dead.

705
00:39:20.936 --> 00:39:21.977
You understand me?

706
00:39:21.978 --> 00:39:23.144
Dead, dead!

707
00:39:23.145 --> 00:39:23.980
Come on, shoot!

708
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:25.522
Come on, come on!

709
00:39:25.523 --> 00:39:26.648
You understand me!

710
00:39:26.649 --> 00:39:27.649
Dead!

711
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.498
You fucking pig!

712
00:39:43.499 --> 00:39:45.960
I hope they fucking fry you!

713
00:39:49.588 --> 00:39:50.630
You’re dead.

714
00:39:50.631 --> 00:39:51.465
You’re dead.

715
00:39:51.466 --> 00:39:52.590
You hear me, you’re dead.

716
00:39:52.591 --> 00:39:54.009
You're dead, bitch!

717
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:57.345
You’re dead!

718
00:39:57.346 --> 00:39:58.596
Come on, now, dirt bag.

719
00:39:58.597 --> 00:39:59.432
Come on, dirt bag.

720
00:39:59.433 --> 00:40:01.308
Come on, come on, come on!

721
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:03.310
Come on, scumbag.

722
00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:04.811
Make your move.

723
00:40:04.812 --> 00:40:05.813
Make my day.

724
00:40:10.484 --> 00:40:12.278
$3.58 for two hot dogs.

725
00:40:13.654 --> 00:40:14.654
There's yours.

726
00:40:16.407 --> 00:40:18.908
You guys see that Ginger
gets a decent burial?


727
00:40:18.909 --> 00:40:21.244
I mean, I’ll send some money
as soon as I get set up.


728
00:40:21.245 --> 00:40:22.412
You don't worry about that.

729
00:40:22.413 --> 00:40:24.290
The County is gonna take care of that.

730
00:40:29.962 --> 00:40:31.379
Are you married?

731
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.547
No.

732
00:40:32.548 --> 00:40:34.758
Never been married.

733
00:40:34.759 --> 00:40:35.718
Have been divorced a few times.

734
00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:37.219
Right, who hasn't, huh?

735
00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:41.139
Who’d wanna marry a fucking cop anyway?

736
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.557
Hey, come on.

737
00:40:42.558 --> 00:40:44.601
We make very good dinner conversation.

738
00:40:44.602 --> 00:40:45.935
Hi, dear, how was your day today?

739
00:40:45.936 --> 00:40:47.979
Oh, you know, the same old bull shit.

740
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.316
I busted a pimp for tying
his girlfriend up to a bed


741
00:40:51.317 --> 00:40:52.817
and then pouring lighter fluid all over

742
00:40:52.818 --> 00:40:53.986
and setting her on fire.

743
00:40:55.154 --> 00:40:57.489
I went around the world twice.

744
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.490
Hmm.

745
00:40:58.491 --> 00:41:02.160
Then there was the

746
00:41:02.161 --> 00:41:04.622
for covering some guy’s
joint on Sunset Boulevard.


747
00:41:06.832 --> 00:41:08.249
Two dead junkies.

748
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.419
One is 16, the other one’s 14.

749
00:41:11.629 --> 00:41:13.756
Well, I spanked a couple of freaks.

750
00:41:16.217 --> 00:41:19.095
Just another happy-go-lucky
day on the vice squad.


751
00:41:21.722 --> 00:41:23.724
We both live in the same toilet, Walsh.

752
00:41:26.435 --> 00:41:27.269
Thanks for the hot dog.

753
00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:28.269
Hey.

754
00:41:30.356 --> 00:41:31.690
Let me give you a ride home.

755
00:41:32.942 --> 00:41:35.402
Well, I got my beauty
sleep this morning.


756
00:41:35.403 --> 00:41:37.487
I'm a working girl in case you forgot.

757
00:41:37.488 --> 00:41:39.906
You're gonna go to work tonight?

758
00:41:39.907 --> 00:41:41.491
Well, I need the bread.

759
00:41:41.492 --> 00:41:43.410
I can’t get set up in
another town for free.


760
00:41:43.411 --> 00:41:44.411
Well, hey, hey.

761
00:41:44.412 --> 00:41:46.162
Wait a minute.

762
00:41:46.163 --> 00:41:47.331
I'm giving you a loan here.

763
00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:50.542
Walsh, you are full of surprises.

764
00:41:50.543 --> 00:41:52.669
You don’t make enough in a
month to loan me what I need.


765
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.630
Yeah, well, maybe
you could lend me a 20.


766
00:41:59.593 --> 00:42:00.719
She’s pretty.

767
00:42:02.304 --> 00:42:03.304
Yeah, she was.

768
00:42:05.182 --> 00:42:06.016
Ciao.

769
00:42:06.017 --> 00:42:07.059
Keep it clean, Walsh.

770
00:42:40.134 --> 00:42:41.885
Look at the bright side, asshole.

771
00:42:41.886 --> 00:42:44.471
You got 20 years to learn
how to play with yourself.


772
00:42:44.472 --> 00:42:45.389
I’m sorry.

773
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.223
My friend is right, butt breath.

774
00:42:47.224 --> 00:42:48.850
You don’t need women anymore.

775
00:42:48.851 --> 00:42:50.478
A few jerk-off pictures maybe.

776
00:42:51.353 --> 00:42:54.731
Hey, Mendez, with his talent,
he could pimp the bunboys.


777
00:42:54.732 --> 00:42:56.275
Ooh, la la.

778
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:58.527
Hey!

779
00:43:21.383 --> 00:43:23.761
Get out of my way!

780
00:43:26.722 --> 00:43:28.766
Walsh is gonna kill us.

781
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.813
I can understand why you’re upset.

782
00:43:46.659 --> 00:43:49.160
You're a lucky man, Kowalski.

783
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:52.413
You’re very lucky that Ramrod
kicked your face in and not me


784
00:43:52.414 --> 00:43:54.582
because I would have done
a much better job of it.


785
00:43:54.583 --> 00:43:55.459
Tom?

786
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.961
Tom, take it easy, man.

787
00:43:57.962 --> 00:43:58.962
Take it easy.

788
00:44:09.056 --> 00:44:11.058
You said he’s out of control.

789
00:44:17.606 --> 00:44:21.277
Okay, everybody knows that
these two officers lost Ramrod.


790
00:44:22.194 --> 00:44:25.113
Now, what are we
gonna do about that, huh?

791
00:44:25.114 --> 00:44:26.114
Huh?

792
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.328
We got two people
out there on the street.

793
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:33.247
Bottom line is this.

794
00:44:33.248 --> 00:44:34.706
That unless we pick one of them up,

795
00:44:34.707 --> 00:44:36.207
we got a dead girl on our hands.

796
00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:37.208
Is that clear?

797
00:44:38.961 --> 00:44:41.254
I mean, it’s very simple, isn’t it?

798
00:44:41.255 --> 00:44:42.339
We find them.

799
00:44:43.465 --> 00:44:44.592
One or the other.

800
00:44:50.639 --> 00:44:52.850
Now, let’s hit the streets.

801
00:45:00.441 --> 00:45:01.400
You apprehend the bastard if he moves.

802
00:45:01.401 --> 00:45:03.693
If he so much as blinks or
scratches his ass, you waste him.


803
00:45:03.694 --> 00:45:04.612
You got that?

804
00:45:04.613 --> 00:45:06.488
I want him out of commission, not you.

805
00:45:08.198 --> 00:45:09.407
Oh, please, please.

806
00:45:09.408 --> 00:45:10.617
Easy, easy, easy.

807
00:45:10.618 --> 00:45:12.827
- Please help me.
- It’s okay.


808
00:45:12.828 --> 00:45:14.704
I'll get somebody here
to help in a minute.


809
00:45:14.705 --> 00:45:16.748
Rich, you get a unit to transport

810
00:45:16.749 --> 00:45:19.000
this girl to a hospital right away.

811
00:45:19.001 --> 00:45:20.711
Okay, sergeant, right away.

812
00:45:22.588 --> 00:45:23.547
What kind of
shit you got yourself


813
00:45:23.547 --> 00:45:24.381
into this time, huh?

814
00:45:24.382 --> 00:45:26.592
What, you got diarrhea
of the mouth, huh?


815
00:45:27.843 --> 00:45:29.010
Come on, Roscoe, move it.

816
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:31.805
Move your black ass and get me
out of this thing, will you?


817
00:45:33.724 --> 00:45:35.391
Let me tell you something, motherfucker.

818
00:45:35.392 --> 00:45:38.811
You don't talk that crappy
shit to me, you hear?


819
00:45:38.812 --> 00:45:40.855
Not with your hands cuffed.

820
00:45:40.856 --> 00:45:42.357
’Cause I’ll set your ass on fire.

821
00:45:42.358 --> 00:45:43.567
Do you hear me?

822
00:45:46.278 --> 00:45:47.278
I’m sorry.

823
00:45:48.656 --> 00:45:49.697
Really, Roscoe.

824
00:45:49.698 --> 00:45:50.698
I'm sorry.

825
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.369
Sorry, my ass.

826
00:46:01.377 --> 00:46:02.753
And not that one.

827
00:46:03.796 --> 00:46:05.505
The blue Ford.

828
00:46:05.506 --> 00:46:07.216
500 don’t get you no El Dorado.

829
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.842
I done done enough on credit.

830
00:46:09.843 --> 00:46:11.053
Have you, boy?

831
00:46:12.554 --> 00:46:14.555
Roscoe, I'll tell you what.

832
00:46:14.556 --> 00:46:15.391
What?

833
00:46:15.391 --> 00:46:16.225
You call Fast Eddie

834
00:46:16.226 --> 00:46:17.850
and you tell him I'm on my way.

835
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:18.851
Give me a dime.

836
00:46:19.978 --> 00:46:21.020
Put it on my credit card.

837
00:46:21.021 --> 00:46:22.021
I appreciate it.

838
00:46:58.642 --> 00:46:59.642
Here’s 50.

839
00:47:00.853 --> 00:47:03.563
Ooh, 50!

840
00:47:03.564 --> 00:47:05.189
Well, you said 25, sweetheart.

841
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:06.024
What’s the extra for?

842
00:47:06.025 --> 00:47:07.275
Don't you want straight sex?

843
00:47:07.276 --> 00:47:08.317
No.

844
00:47:08.318 --> 00:47:09.445
No, I want...

845
00:47:12.948 --> 00:47:15.199
Hmmm, what do you want?

846
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.326
I want to suck your toes.

847
00:47:17.327 --> 00:47:19.370
Ooh, okay, I’ll go wash up.

848
00:47:19.371 --> 00:47:20.371
Oh, no.

849
00:47:22.916 --> 00:47:24.543
No, that won’t be necessary.

850
00:47:27.921 --> 00:47:28.921
Hmm.

851
00:47:33.635 --> 00:47:37.514
It seems to me that you
have been very naughty.


852
00:47:39.099 --> 00:47:40.099
Yes.

853
00:47:43.187 --> 00:47:45.689
I've been a pretty bad boy.

854
00:47:47.107 --> 00:47:48.107
Mm-hmm.

855
00:47:50.944 --> 00:47:52.487
Well, since you paid extra,

856
00:47:52.488 --> 00:47:54.656
I think you deserve a good spanking.

857
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.015
How’re you doing, Eddie?

858
00:49:03.016 --> 00:49:05.101
Think this will do?

859
00:49:05.102 --> 00:49:06.228
Oh, that's beautiful.

860
00:49:07.229 --> 00:49:08.355
That’ll do just fine.

861
00:49:10.816 --> 00:49:12.359
Here’s the rest of your stuff.

862
00:49:16.822 --> 00:49:17.822
Hey, Eddie?

863
00:49:17.823 --> 00:49:18.823
Yo.

864
00:49:21.368 --> 00:49:23.494
What kind of shit are
you trying to hand me?


865
00:49:23.495 --> 00:49:25.538
I want an automatic, you understand?

866
00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:26.998
Automatic.

867
00:49:26.999 --> 00:49:28.165
And I want it right now,

868
00:49:28.166 --> 00:49:31.294
before I redecorate that
pretty little head of yours.


869
00:49:31.295 --> 00:49:32.295
Now move.

870
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:34.589
Ramrod.

871
00:49:36.216 --> 00:49:37.675
You bad.

872
00:49:37.676 --> 00:49:39.303
All you got to do his ask.

873
00:49:40.804 --> 00:49:43.849
But automatics are expensive.

874
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.019
But don’t you worry, all right?

875
00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:48.854
No sweat.

876
00:49:48.854 --> 00:49:49.688
My man will be here

877
00:49:49.689 --> 00:49:52.357
with a bag of pure white
Asian before you can


878
00:49:53.275 --> 00:49:55.527
jump out of your leathers
and spank yourself.


879
00:49:56.528 --> 00:49:57.528
Listen, one other thing.

880
00:49:57.529 --> 00:49:59.447
You know a bitch named Princess?

881
00:49:59.448 --> 00:50:02.491
Yeah, but I ain't seen her
since I opened this club.


882
00:50:02.492 --> 00:50:03.619
Well, who's her pimp?

883
00:50:05.162 --> 00:50:05.996
She ain’t got no pimp.

884
00:50:05.996 --> 00:50:06.996
She's outlaw.

885
00:50:08.665 --> 00:50:09.499
No, no.

886
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.334
She had a pimp when
she first came to LA.

887
00:50:11.335 --> 00:50:12.335
Who was he?

888
00:50:13.378 --> 00:50:14.378
Who was he?

889
00:50:15.672 --> 00:50:16.672
Come on, Eddie.

890
00:50:17.925 --> 00:50:20.134
That fucking sugar pimp, Dorsey.

891
00:50:20.135 --> 00:50:20.969
Dorsey?

892
00:50:20.969 --> 00:50:21.969
Where's he living?

893
00:50:22.804 --> 00:50:24.514
Hey, who fucking knows.

894
00:50:28.185 --> 00:50:30.645
Somebody knows, Eddie.

895
00:50:30.646 --> 00:50:32.313
Somebody knows.

896
00:50:32.314 --> 00:50:34.982
Hey, Charlie Chrisandra would know.

897
00:50:34.983 --> 00:50:35.817
Chrisandra?

898
00:50:35.817 --> 00:50:36.817
Yeah.

899
00:50:37.611 --> 00:50:39.862
Let's say you give
him a call, all right?


900
00:50:39.863 --> 00:50:41.989
Oh, no favor is
too big for a friend.

901
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.990
Call him.

902
00:50:45.911 --> 00:50:46.745
Get your hands off me.

903
00:50:46.746 --> 00:50:47.995
Stop it.

904
00:50:47.996 --> 00:50:48.830
Get your hands off of me.

905
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:49.830
Quit it.

906
00:50:50.499 --> 00:50:51.333
Fuck you.

907
00:50:51.334 --> 00:50:52.541
God, you’re crazy.

908
00:50:52.542 --> 00:50:53.418
Jesus, man!

909
00:50:53.419 --> 00:50:55.419
The bats are out tonight.

910
00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.715
I mean, whores, faggots,
pimps and hustlers.


911
00:50:59.967 --> 00:51:03.386
Junkies, drag queens and freaks, man.

912
00:51:03.387 --> 00:51:04.805
This city sucks.

913
00:51:06.556 --> 00:51:08.683
Sergeant, you’ve been
working this soil for,


914
00:51:08.684 --> 00:51:10.226
what, for 13 years?

915
00:51:10.227 --> 00:51:11.519
How do you hack it?

916
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.813
Well, this little
rule I keep for myself.


917
00:51:13.814 --> 00:51:15.272
Edwards, there’s two
days out of every week


918
00:51:15.273 --> 00:51:16.108
I don't worry about.

919
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:17.484
Yesterday and tomorrow.

920
00:51:19.277 --> 00:51:20.946
Now where the fuck is she?

921
00:51:24.282 --> 00:51:26.117
Thanks for the treatment, Doc.

922
00:51:26.118 --> 00:51:29.829
And don't go spending my money
all in the same place, huh?


923
00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:30.830
Don’t worry.

924
00:51:33.125 --> 00:51:35.876
Hey, when you get settled in San Diego,

925
00:51:35.877 --> 00:51:37.879
you let me know where you’re at, because,

926
00:51:38.755 --> 00:51:40.090
you’re sure worth the trip.

927
00:51:41.425 --> 00:51:42.425
Okay.

928
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:44.260
Bye, Tim.

929
00:52:25.886 --> 00:52:27.553
Hey, sugar baby.

930
00:52:27.554 --> 00:52:28.889
I'll catch you later, okay?

931
00:52:33.852 --> 00:52:35.728
My main man, Silky.

932
00:52:35.729 --> 00:52:37.897
I want to talk
to you so pay attention.

933
00:52:37.898 --> 00:52:38.774
Look at those photographs.

934
00:52:38.774 --> 00:52:39.733
Get out of my face, mama.

935
00:52:39.734 --> 00:52:41.150
You ain't got no right
to be leaning on me.


936
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:42.318
What’s wrong with you?

937
00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:43.819
No, it’s what’s going
to be wrong with you.


938
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.030
What do you mean what’s
going to be wrong with me?


939
00:52:46.031 --> 00:52:46.865
Hey, hey!

940
00:52:46.866 --> 00:52:48.032
Blink your eyes, motherfuckers,

941
00:52:48.033 --> 00:52:49.284
and you die in the dark.

942
00:52:53.872 --> 00:52:56.083
You ain’t black, woman.

943
00:52:57.042 --> 00:52:58.293
You shit colored.

944
00:52:59.377 --> 00:53:00.587
You got it, Jack.

945
00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:04.131
Now, you think you
can act like a gentleman


946
00:53:04.132 --> 00:53:05.925
and answer the lady’s questions?

947
00:53:05.926 --> 00:53:08.010
Or do I re-arrange your face?

948
00:53:08.011 --> 00:53:08.845
Okay, man.

949
00:53:08.846 --> 00:53:09.846
Just cool it, man.

950
00:53:09.846 --> 00:53:10.846
Just cool it.

951
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.935
Okay, Silky, let’s try it again.

952
00:53:15.936 --> 00:53:17.061
Look at that photograph.

953
00:53:17.062 --> 00:53:18.437
Yeah, I know this psycho honky.

954
00:53:18.438 --> 00:53:19.272
He was in here earlier.

955
00:53:19.273 --> 00:53:20.606
I ain't seen him since.

956
00:53:20.607 --> 00:53:21.525
Where can we find him?

957
00:53:21.526 --> 00:53:23.692
What’s in it for me?

958
00:53:23.693 --> 00:53:25.737
Peace of mind, brother.

959
00:53:27.864 --> 00:53:30.659
Well, try Roscoe’s
garage over in Berendo.


960
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:34.329
Thank you very much for
your cooperation, sir.


961
00:53:39.543 --> 00:53:41.710
I like to be home watching television.

962
00:53:41.711 --> 00:53:43.964
There’s just too much
heat on the street for me.


963
00:53:45.841 --> 00:53:47.091
Where's my hat?

964
00:53:47.092 --> 00:53:47.926
Here it is.

965
00:53:47.926 --> 00:53:48.760
Give me that.

966
00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.594
Those cops was out of line.

967
00:53:49.595 --> 00:53:52.055
Lucky for them punks, 
I kept my temper.

968
00:54:05.902 --> 00:54:07.070
$3.50, ma’am.

969
00:54:09.281 --> 00:54:10.281
Keep it.

970
00:54:23.753 --> 00:54:24.588
Hey!

971
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:25.589
Hey, Dixie.

972
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.048
How are you doing?

973
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.385
You look great.

974
00:54:31.928 --> 00:54:32.762
Princess.

975
00:54:32.762 --> 00:54:33.597
Hi, Coco.

976
00:54:33.597 --> 00:54:34.431
Hi.

977
00:54:34.432 --> 00:54:35.432
Where have you been lately?

978
00:54:35.432 --> 00:54:36.391
Haven’t seen you in a while.

979
00:54:36.392 --> 00:54:37.683
I had the flu.

980
00:54:37.684 --> 00:54:40.353
The doctor said I had to stay
out of bed for a few days.


981
00:54:41.813 --> 00:54:43.480
I got busted tonight.

982
00:54:43.481 --> 00:54:44.690
- You're kidding!
- Oh, no.


983
00:54:44.691 --> 00:54:47.109
It took my pimp less
than an hour to post bond.


984
00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:48.527
Ooh, that’s fast.

985
00:54:48.528 --> 00:54:49.362
That is fast.

986
00:54:49.363 --> 00:54:51.030
Well, he knows my
pussy can make no money


987
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:52.240
sitting in the slammer.

988
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.577
You having a good night?

989
00:54:56.578 --> 00:54:58.704
Nothing but Greeks and freaks.

990
00:54:58.705 --> 00:55:00.915
I tell you nobody wants
straight sex anymore.


991
00:55:00.916 --> 00:55:02.166
I got lucky.

992
00:55:02.167 --> 00:55:05.252
I have a date tonight with
guy who was hung like a horse.


993
00:55:05.253 --> 00:55:08.757
I mean, so big, he had to
get it hard in sections.


994
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:11.468
I had a clock watcher.

995
00:55:11.469 --> 00:55:13.928
He thought I was charging
him by the minute.


996
00:55:13.929 --> 00:55:16.222
Girl, these kinda
freaks, they’re all alike.


997
00:55:16.223 --> 00:55:19.976
They wanna pop twice for the same price.

998
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:22.938
Here’s to freaks.

999
00:55:22.939 --> 00:55:24.147
Yeah, freaks.

1000
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.024
Hey, beautiful.

1001
00:55:26.025 --> 00:55:28.026
How’d you like a trip to paradise.

1002
00:55:29.527 --> 00:55:31.070
Now, that depends.

1003
00:55:31.071 --> 00:55:32.529
You a friend or foe?

1004
00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:35.784
Sweetheart, you're looking
at a horny conventioneer.


1005
00:55:36.952 --> 00:55:38.328
Listen to him.

1006
00:55:42.791 --> 00:55:43.791
See this face?

1007
00:55:45.377 --> 00:55:48.879
Seen more ass than a cowboy’s saddle.

1008
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.631
Think you can handle me?

1009
00:55:50.632 --> 00:55:53.384
Mister, I can handle the
whole god damn convention.


1010
00:55:53.385 --> 00:55:55.929
She can handle two conventions.

1011
00:55:56.846 --> 00:55:57.888
See you later, Princess.

1012
00:55:57.889 --> 00:55:58.723
See you later.

1013
00:55:58.724 --> 00:56:00.057
I'll keep it short and sweet.

1014
00:56:00.058 --> 00:56:02.434
Whoo, I know you will.

1015
00:56:02.435 --> 00:56:04.228
- Bye, Princess.
- Bye, sweetheart.


1016
00:56:04.229 --> 00:56:05.229
Have fun.

1017
00:57:03.246 --> 00:57:04.413

1018

that you know a bitch named Princess.

1023
00:57:18.219 --> 00:57:19.219
Am I right, boy?

1024
00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.306
Man, I haven’t seen her.

1025
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:24.350
Oh, please, man,

1026
00:57:24.351 --> 00:57:25.768
you’re hurting me.

1027
00:57:25.769 --> 00:57:27.019
I’m hurting you.

1028
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:27.896
Where does she live, boy?

1029
00:57:27.897 --> 00:57:29.521
She never told me.

1030
00:57:29.522 --> 00:57:30.357
Where does she hang out?

1031
00:57:30.358 --> 00:57:31.358
Huh, huh?

1032
00:57:31.359 --> 00:57:32.858
Bars, motels.

1033
00:57:32.859 --> 00:57:33.693
Answer me.

1034
00:57:33.694 --> 00:57:34.985
Hollywood, Hollywood.

1035
00:57:34.986 --> 00:57:35.820
Hollywood?

1036
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:36.654
Where in Hollywood?

1037
00:57:36.654 --> 00:57:37.489
Sunset.

1038
00:57:37.489 --> 00:57:38.323
Where, where?

1039
00:57:38.324 --> 00:57:39.406
Where?

1040
00:57:39.407 --> 00:57:40.574
The Golden Motel, man.

1041
00:57:40.575 --> 00:57:41.409
Shh.

1042
00:57:41.409 --> 00:57:42.409
Shh, shh.

1043
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:49.541
You know what the problem is
that you sugar pimps have?


1044
00:57:49.542 --> 00:57:51.628
You don't know how to handle your bitches.

1045
00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:55.506
Why?

1046
00:57:55.507 --> 00:57:57.509
’Cause I don’t think
you got any balls, boy.


1047
00:58:04.808 --> 00:58:06.266
Hey, bitch.

1048
00:58:06.267 --> 00:58:08.978
What the fuck am I paying you for?

1049
00:58:09.938 --> 00:58:10.772
Come on.

1050
00:58:10.772 --> 00:58:11.772
Come on move it.

1051
00:58:13.566 --> 00:58:15.568
Move your ass, bitch.

1052
00:58:56.025 --> 00:58:57.526
What the fuck are you doing?

1053
00:58:57.527 --> 00:58:59.279
You’re a lousy piece of ass.

1054
00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.572
I'm taking my money back.

1055
00:59:01.573 --> 00:59:04.159
Give my purse, you fucking...

1056
00:59:06.494 --> 00:59:07.494
Jesus.

1057
00:59:07.495 --> 00:59:08.329
What did you do?

1058
00:59:08.329 --> 00:59:09.205
Fucked the whole football team?

1059
00:59:09.206 --> 00:59:11.081
You know, you’re lucky
I’m not charging you


1060
00:59:11.082 --> 00:59:12.292
for wasting my time.

1061
00:59:15.837 --> 00:59:17.421
Go ahead, motherfucker.

1062
00:59:17.422 --> 00:59:18.881
I got a nigger pimp so mean,

1063
00:59:18.882 --> 00:59:22.134
when he gets through with
you, you’ll pray you’ll die.


1064
00:59:22.135 --> 00:59:23.135
Asshole.

1065
00:59:25.722 --> 00:59:26.722
Asshole.

1066
00:59:27.557 --> 00:59:30.518
You’ll pray you’ll die,
you lousy fucking asshole.


1067
00:59:42.363 --> 00:59:46.366
He's not at all anxious to
be an accessory to murder.


1068
00:59:46.367 --> 00:59:48.119
Are you, Roscoe, baby?

1069
00:59:49.954 --> 00:59:51.538
Right.

1070
00:59:51.539 --> 00:59:55.210
Ramrod’s driving a 1979 Ford
Brougham, just repainted blue.


1071
00:59:56.336 --> 00:59:58.587
Also get a team
over to Fast Eddie's bar.

1072
00:59:58.588 --> 01:00:00.131
Ramrod went there to get a gun.

1073
01:00:02.759 --> 01:00:05.637
You're so cooperative, Roscoe.

1074
01:00:06.638 --> 01:00:08.056
Nice, Roscoe.

1075
01:00:22.111 --> 01:00:22.987
Office.

1076
01:00:22.988 --> 01:00:24.655
Mrs. Cruikshank, do me a favor

1077
01:00:24.656 --> 01:00:26.533
and get me some clean sheets, will ya?

1078
01:00:29.327 --> 01:00:32.788
Her Royal Highness thinks
this is the fucking Plaza Hotel.


1079
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:34.373
Who’s move is it, Wong?

1080
01:00:34.374 --> 01:00:35.974
I believe it is mine, Mrs. Cruikshank.

1081
01:00:38.253 --> 01:00:39.379
Come, beat me.

1082
01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:44.258
Six Victor three,

1083
01:00:44.259 --> 01:00:45.926
we just covered the Hollywood Bowl area.

1084
01:00:45.927 --> 01:00:47.427
We drew a blank.

1085
01:00:47.428 --> 01:00:48.470
Shit.

1086
01:00:48.471 --> 01:00:51.974
Six Victor
seven, have you got anything?


1087
01:00:51.975 --> 01:00:54.309
Six Victor seven, negative.

1088
01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.020
We're at Hollywood and Cahuenga.

1089
01:00:59.649 --> 01:01:04.111
Well, Princess, ain’t we
the popular one tonight.


1090
01:01:04.112 --> 01:01:05.529
What are you talking about?

1091
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:08.240
Someone's waiting for
you in the parking lot.


1092
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:10.451
Asked for you by name.

1093
01:01:15.957 --> 01:01:16.957
25 bucks.

1094
01:01:26.676 --> 01:01:28.176
Pardon me.

1095
01:01:28.177 --> 01:01:29.970
Are you Miss Princess?

1096
01:01:29.971 --> 01:01:31.972
Well, that depends.

1097
01:01:31.973 --> 01:01:33.725
As I told Madam Cruikshank,

1098
01:01:34.726 --> 01:01:37.020
you were referred to me
by a certain Miss Coco.


1099
01:01:38.104 --> 01:01:41.316
My employer would like to
avail himself of your services.


1100
01:01:44.694 --> 01:01:46.820
Now what does he have in mind?

1101
01:01:46.821 --> 01:01:48.656
You'll have to discuss that with him.

1102
01:02:11.137 --> 01:02:12.638
Hello, Walsh.

1103
01:02:12.639 --> 01:02:14.890
I thought I better let
you in on this one.

1104
01:02:14.891 --> 01:02:16.016
What have you got, Brooks?

1105
01:02:16.017 --> 01:02:17.934
Some joker just cut the gonads

1106
01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:20.479
off a sugar pimp named Dorsey.

1107
01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.689
Could have been your boy.

1108
01:02:22.607 --> 01:02:23.899
Dorsey said he was looking

1109
01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.109
for a little hooker named Princess.

1110
01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.070
Did he tell
Ramrod where to find her?


1111
01:02:28.071 --> 01:02:30.530
Yeah, he said the Golden Motel.

1112
01:02:30.531 --> 01:02:31.531
Oh, shit.

1113
01:02:32.367 --> 01:02:34.077
That’s the other end of the strip.

1114
01:02:41.918 --> 01:02:43.418
All six Victor units,

1115
01:02:43.419 --> 01:02:47.548
suspect heading for Golden
Motel, Sunset and Cahuenga.


1116
01:02:51.636 --> 01:02:52.636
Where’s Princess?

1117
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:01.645
Cool it, you big palooka.

1118
01:03:01.646 --> 01:03:03.105
You’re gonna get us killed.

1119
01:03:03.106 --> 01:03:04.856
We’re coming up against a psycho asshole

1120
01:03:04.857 --> 01:03:05.857
who can blow us away, man.

1121
01:03:05.858 --> 01:03:08.360
You’re worried about a
fucking little fender bender.


1122
01:03:08.361 --> 01:03:10.654
Who’s worried about a
fucking fender bender?


1123
01:03:10.655 --> 01:03:12.280
Doesn’t anything scare you?

1124
01:03:12.281 --> 01:03:13.116
Yeah, man.

1125
01:03:13.116 --> 01:03:13.950
All the time.

1126
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:14.784
Why do you think I have those

1127
01:03:14.785 --> 01:03:16.326
god damn nightmares every night?

1128
01:03:16.327 --> 01:03:17.411
Those are just dreams.

1129
01:03:17.412 --> 01:03:20.539
Plain, every day, ordinary dreams.

1130
01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.541
Watch it!

1131
01:03:24.711 --> 01:03:26.337
This is a nightmare.

1132
01:03:36.389 --> 01:03:37.807
Take it, Kowalski.

1133
01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:51.195
What in the hell happened here?

1134
01:03:52.739 --> 01:03:55.282
You pigs are always alike.

1135
01:03:55.283 --> 01:03:58.076
A day later, a dollar short.

1136
01:03:58.077 --> 01:03:58.911
And that’s the truth.

1137
01:03:58.912 --> 01:04:00.872
Did Mr. Cleaver tap-dance through here?

1138
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:02.914
Get the hell out of here.

1139
01:04:02.915 --> 01:04:03.750
Listen, lady.

1140
01:04:03.751 --> 01:04:05.083
Is this the guy?

1141
01:04:05.084 --> 01:04:06.126
Get the hell out of here.

1142
01:04:06.127 --> 01:04:07.419
She’s my friend.

1143
01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.380
You better leave Madam Cruikshank alone.

1144
01:04:10.923 --> 01:04:13.550
Get this ornamental out of my face.

1145
01:04:13.551 --> 01:04:15.010
Hey, man, not the nose.

1146
01:04:15.011 --> 01:04:18.555
Okay, Bruce Lee, enough of that shit.

1147
01:04:18.556 --> 01:04:19.639
My name is Wong, not Lee.

1148
01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.767
Okay, Wong.

1149
01:04:22.018 --> 01:04:23.227
Okay!

1150
01:04:25.563 --> 01:04:27.273
You, son of a bitch.

1151
01:04:28.107 --> 01:04:30.109
Not the nose.

1152
01:04:38.201 --> 01:04:39.577
Freeze, mister.

1153
01:04:44.207 --> 01:04:45.415
Where's Ramrod?

1154
01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:46.501
We missed him, Tom.

1155
01:04:50.505 --> 01:04:52.631
What a way to make a living.

1156
01:04:52.632 --> 01:04:53.632
I’ll say.

1157
01:04:56.677 --> 01:04:59.137
I think I’ll shoot the bastard.

1158
01:04:59.138 --> 01:05:01.264
Wouldn't look good on
the six o’clock news.


1159
01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:04.559
Okay, Cruikshank,
what did you tell Ramrod?


1160
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.977
I didn’t tell him nothing.

1161
01:05:05.978 --> 01:05:06.813
Bullshit.

1162
01:05:06.814 --> 01:05:08.188
If you didn’t tell him anything,

1163
01:05:08.189 --> 01:05:10.565
you wouldn't be alive right now.

1164
01:05:10.566 --> 01:05:11.901
I didn’t tell him nothing.

1165
01:05:26.249 --> 01:05:27.083
Hey, Dixie.

1166
01:05:27.084 --> 01:05:28.667
Come on over here.

1167
01:05:28.668 --> 01:05:29.544
Come on, come on, baby.

1168
01:05:29.545 --> 01:05:31.003
All I wanna do is talk to you.

1169
01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:35.507
How you doing, Dixie?

1170
01:05:35.508 --> 01:05:37.425
Listen, Ramrod, my pimp
sees me talking to you,


1171
01:05:37.426 --> 01:05:38.261
he’ll beat the shit out of me.

1172
01:05:38.262 --> 01:05:40.136
Shh, just relax, bitch.

1173
01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:43.390
Now what can you tell me about
a big, Cadillac limousine.


1174
01:05:43.391 --> 01:05:45.225
Oh, that’s Coco's gig.

1175
01:05:45.226 --> 01:05:47.143
That’s Coco’s gig, huh?

1176
01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:48.895
Who the fuck is Coco, bitch?

1177
01:05:48.896 --> 01:05:50.438
Just one of the girls.

1178
01:05:50.439 --> 01:05:51.731
Which one?

1179
01:05:51.732 --> 01:05:54.442
The one in the pink,
at the corner there.


1180
01:05:54.443 --> 01:05:56.152
Please, please.

1181
01:05:56.153 --> 01:05:58.113
- Please, Ramrod.
- Shh.


1182
01:05:58.114 --> 01:05:59.114
Okay.

1183
01:06:17.967 --> 01:06:18.801
Hello.

1184
01:06:18.802 --> 01:06:20.594
Well, hello, beautiful.

1185
01:06:20.595 --> 01:06:21.429
Are you a cop?

1186
01:06:21.429 --> 01:06:22.263
Am I a cop?

1187
01:06:22.264 --> 01:06:24.723
What do I look like some
kind of fucking pig?


1188
01:06:24.724 --> 01:06:26.391
Maybe.

1189
01:06:26.392 --> 01:06:27.851
You looking for a date?

1190
01:06:27.852 --> 01:06:30.020
Yeah, yeah, I’m looking for a date.

1191
01:06:30.021 --> 01:06:32.439
Why don’t you come here a little closer.

1192
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.481
I hear you’re good.

1193
01:06:33.482 --> 01:06:34.733
Are you real good?

1194
01:06:34.734 --> 01:06:35.901
Hmm, well,

1195
01:06:35.902 --> 01:06:37.694
well, I had no complaints.

1196
01:06:37.695 --> 01:06:39.415
Where did that Cadillac
take the Princess?


1197
01:06:40.323 --> 01:06:41.406
I said, where did it take her?

1198
01:06:41.407 --> 01:06:42.241
Where?

1199
01:06:42.242 --> 01:06:43.325
Coco!

1200
01:06:43.326 --> 01:06:44.326
No!

1201
01:10:45.109 --> 01:10:46.442
Hey, what the...

1202
01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:47.443
Shh.

1203
01:10:48.237 --> 01:10:49.947
Remember, not a word.

1204
01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.240
You agreed.

1205
01:12:15.282 --> 01:12:16.116
Sick old fuck head.

1206
01:12:16.116 --> 01:12:16.951
You scared the shit out of me.

1207
01:12:16.952 --> 01:12:18.576
You ruined it, slut.

1208
01:12:18.577 --> 01:12:20.245
Roberts told you not to talk.

1209
01:12:20.246 --> 01:12:21.996
You ruined it.

1210
01:12:21.997 --> 01:12:23.748
I could have died of
a fucking heart attack.


1211
01:12:23.749 --> 01:12:24.791
Roberts.

1212
01:12:24.792 --> 01:12:25.792
Roberts.

1213
01:12:27.044 --> 01:12:29.420
She talked.

1214
01:12:29.421 --> 01:12:30.256
I instructed her not to, sir.

1215
01:12:30.256 --> 01:12:31.131
But she did.

1216
01:12:31.132 --> 01:12:33.217
Get that slut out of here.

1217
01:12:34.468 --> 01:12:35.677
Yes, sir.

1218
01:12:35.678 --> 01:12:37.887
Please, come with me.

1219
01:12:37.888 --> 01:12:41.475
Belong in a fucking loony
bin, you son of a bitch.


1220
01:12:45.688 --> 01:12:47.105
Jesus Christ, why didn't you warn me?

1221
01:12:47.106 --> 01:12:48.481
I have my instructions.

1222
01:12:48.482 --> 01:12:49.899
You better go change.

1223
01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:52.110
That old shit should
have died 50 years ago.


1224
01:12:52.111 --> 01:12:54.279
There’s a taxi waiting
for you, Miss Princess.


1225
01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.239
I’m not paying for it.

1226
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.532
It’s been taken care of.

1227
01:12:59.118 --> 01:13:00.286
Do you work every night?

1228
01:13:01.412 --> 01:13:03.621
Forget it, I’ve already
had my scare for the week.


1229
01:13:03.622 --> 01:13:05.498
No, you don’t understand.

1230
01:13:05.499 --> 01:13:07.709
Tomorrow night’s my night off.

1231
01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:08.710
Will you be working?

1232
01:13:09.878 --> 01:13:13.299
I’ll be in church asking
God to forgive that old fuck.


1233
01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:17.820
Get on the horn, partner,

1234
01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:19.156
and tell him we found Coco.

1235
01:14:20.074 --> 01:14:21.240
Female, oriental, located.

1236
01:14:21.241 --> 01:14:22.117
Advised as friendly.

1237
01:14:22.118 --> 01:14:23.993
Possibly at 7th and Rossmore.

1238
01:14:23.994 --> 01:14:25.119
Roger, central.

1239
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.455
This is six Victor 10
to all six Victor units.


1240
01:14:27.456 --> 01:14:29.540
We have a location on Princess.

1241
01:14:29.541 --> 01:14:31.417
Converge at 7th and Rossmore.

1242
01:14:31.418 --> 01:14:32.252
I repeat,

1243
01:14:32.253 --> 01:14:34.712
converge at 7th and Rossmore.

1244
01:14:34.713 --> 01:14:36.507
Put the hammer to it, Edwards.

1245
01:16:14.646 --> 01:16:15.646
Hi, Ma.

1246
01:16:16.482 --> 01:16:17.482
Hi, it’s me.

1247
01:16:18.901 --> 01:16:21.861
I'm sorry I’m calling so late, but,

1248
01:16:21.862 --> 01:16:23.946
oh, I just got to thinking about Lisa.

1249
01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:25.364
I don’t give a damn what he did.

1250
01:16:25.365 --> 01:16:26.241
Look what he did to Coco.

1251
01:16:26.242 --> 01:16:27.242
I couldn’t help it.

1252
01:16:27.243 --> 01:16:28.326
He had a knife to my face.

1253
01:16:28.327 --> 01:16:29.494
I don’t give a damn.

1254
01:16:29.495 --> 01:16:30.329
Look what he did to Coco.

1255
01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:31.496
Listen, I don’t want to talk to you.

1256
01:16:31.497 --> 01:16:32.456
I don’t care what the problem was.

1257
01:16:32.457 --> 01:16:33.498
You shouldn’t have told him anything.

1258
01:16:33.499 --> 01:16:35.541
There's Princess!

1259
01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:37.793
Oh, I wish you wouldn’t cry.

1260
01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:39.838
I think we better tell her about Ramrod.

1261
01:16:43.467 --> 01:16:44.426
Oh, my God!

1262
01:16:44.427 --> 01:16:45.427
What's the matter?

1263
01:16:45.428 --> 01:16:47.262
There he is.

1264
01:16:49.389 --> 01:16:50.389
Princess!

1265
01:17:12.496 --> 01:17:14.247
Hey, lady!

1266
01:17:14.248 --> 01:17:16.833
What do you think you’re doing?

1267
01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:22.214
Hello, Princess.

1268
01:17:25.342 --> 01:17:26.342
I got you.

1269
01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:34.684
Somebody call the cops.

1270
01:17:34.685 --> 01:17:37.144
And she left just a few minutes ago.

1271
01:17:37.145 --> 01:17:38.688
But you didn’t hear her tell the driver

1272
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:39.689
where she wanted to go?

1273
01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:40.524
I thought she...

1274
01:17:40.524 --> 01:17:41.358
Walsh, he's got her.

1275
01:17:41.358 --> 01:17:42.317
He's in a white pickup truck.

1276
01:17:42.318 --> 01:17:45.069
He was last seen on Van Ness,
heading south on Santa Monica.


1277
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:46.195
Put out an APB.

1278
01:17:46.196 --> 01:17:47.947
I put out a kidnapping broadcast.

1279
01:17:47.948 --> 01:17:48.782
Come on.

1280
01:17:48.782 --> 01:17:49.616
Hey, where are we going?

1281
01:17:49.616 --> 01:17:50.450
South on Van
Ness and Santa Monica.


1282
01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:51.451
Okay, here we go.

1283
01:17:51.451 --> 01:17:52.286
Move out.

1284
01:17:52.286 --> 01:17:53.120
Cover the side streets.

1285
01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:53.954
Okay, let’s go.

1286
01:17:53.954 --> 01:17:54.913
You black and whites cover Bronson.

1287
01:17:54.914 --> 01:17:56.330
Kowalski, you take Pico.

1288
01:17:56.331 --> 01:17:57.666
We'll take Van Ness.

1289
01:18:05.924 --> 01:18:07.551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1290
01:18:10.387 --> 01:18:11.554
Central, any word of pickup truck?

1291
01:18:11.555 --> 01:18:13.556
Nothing yet, six Victor 10.

1292
01:18:13.557 --> 01:18:14.557
We have everyone working on it.

1293
01:18:14.558 --> 01:18:17.184
Do you plan on running surveillance?

1294
01:18:17.185 --> 01:18:20.730
Affirmative, we have to find him first.

1295
01:18:20.731 --> 01:18:22.106
Pico from Van Ness to Vermont.

1296
01:18:22.107 --> 01:18:23.107
No sign.

1297
01:18:24.735 --> 01:18:26.194
Continue east on Pico.

1298
01:18:28.196 --> 01:18:30.282
Six Victor
seven, what is your location?


1299
01:18:31.283 --> 01:18:34.494
We're heading north on
Western, south of Washington.


1300
01:19:05.567 --> 01:19:08.070
This is one
Mary, M32 to six Victor 10.


1301
01:19:09.279 --> 01:19:11.113
We have spotted suspect vehicle

1302
01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:13.532
heading east on Beverly and Linden.

1303
01:19:13.533 --> 01:19:14.950
We are following.

1304
01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.994
Roger, one Mary X-ray two.

1305
01:19:16.995 --> 01:19:19.080
Vehicle is not, repeat is not under

1306
01:19:19.081 --> 01:19:21.582
any circumstances to be apprehended.

1307
01:19:21.583 --> 01:19:23.209
We will establish a point

1308
01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:25.295
and maintain a moving surveillance.

1309
01:19:30.717 --> 01:19:33.387
Suspect vehicle is
now heading south on Oxford.


1310
01:19:35.222 --> 01:19:37.056
Six Victor
seven, we are closest,


1311
01:19:37.057 --> 01:19:38.099
we’ll pick 'em up.

1312
01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.351
Okay, you got the point.

1313
01:19:46.775 --> 01:19:49.318
Listen, six Victor seven
and all other units.


1314
01:19:49.319 --> 01:19:50.903
Do not close in on Ramrod.

1315
01:19:50.904 --> 01:19:53.072
If he sees us, he’ll kill Princess.

1316
01:19:53.073 --> 01:19:54.198
We'll close in when he lands.

1317
01:19:54.199 --> 01:19:57.868
Ramrod heading east on
Olympic, driving erratically.


1318
01:19:57.869 --> 01:20:01.122
We got the back door,
about a half a mile behind.


1319
01:20:01.123 --> 01:20:03.708
Now keep it cool, we
don't want to burn him.


1320
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:04.709
Roger.

1321
01:20:07.379 --> 01:20:09.880
Six Victor three, where are you?

1322
01:20:09.881 --> 01:20:12.592
We are parallel to the
vehicle, heading east on Pico.


1323
01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:16.011
Bitch.

1324
01:20:18.432 --> 01:20:20.851
Ramrod now heading
east on Almeida at 4th.


1325
01:20:24.563 --> 01:20:26.230
I think we might get burned.

1326
01:20:26.231 --> 01:20:27.648
So we’re peeling off.

1327
01:20:27.649 --> 01:20:29.525
Roger, six Victor seven.

1328
01:20:29.526 --> 01:20:31.110
Six Victor three,

1329
01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:33.113
take the point, but stay out of sight.

1330
01:20:51.173 --> 01:20:53.550
We've got him,
he’s on Almeida passing 1st.


1331
01:20:57.095 --> 01:20:58.638
You like to bite?

1332
01:21:01.308 --> 01:21:03.976
The asshole’s crossing
the 6th Street Bridge.


1333
01:21:03.977 --> 01:21:04.811
Drop back.

1334
01:21:04.812 --> 01:21:05.812
Don't crowd him.

1335
01:21:56.571 --> 01:21:57.405
Ah!

1336
01:21:57.405 --> 01:21:58.405
Bitch!

1337
01:22:22.806 --> 01:22:23.806
That’s it.

1338
01:22:24.599 --> 01:22:27.017
Our pigeon has landed.

1339
01:22:27.018 --> 01:22:28.978
It’s a warehouse, corner
of 7th and Mill Street.


1340
01:22:28.979 --> 01:22:32.273
To all six Victor units, move in.

1341
01:22:32.274 --> 01:22:33.441
Roger.

1342
01:22:58.133 --> 01:23:01.343
You see, Princess, what I did
to Ginger, it ain’t nothing,


1343
01:23:01.344 --> 01:23:03.305
compared to what I’m
going to do to you.

1344
01:23:05.223 --> 01:23:06.558
No more kicking, bitch.

1345
01:23:08.268 --> 01:23:09.393
No more scratching, you understand me?

1346
01:23:09.394 --> 01:23:11.228
’Cause now it's my turn.

1347
01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:12.229
You fuck.

1348
01:23:14.107 --> 01:23:15.107
Ow!

1349
01:23:16.651 --> 01:23:17.651
God damn it!

1350
01:23:25.076 --> 01:23:25.911
Where are they?

1351
01:23:25.912 --> 01:23:29.706
I think they’re up
there in the fifth floor.


1352
01:23:53.939 --> 01:23:56.315
I’m going to find you, bitch.

1353
01:23:56.316 --> 01:23:57.316
You hear me?

1354
01:23:58.276 --> 01:23:59.361
I'm going to find you.

1355
01:24:28.056 --> 01:24:29.056
It’s over.

1356
01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:31.266
Over.

1357
01:24:39.150 --> 01:24:40.651
We found this in the pickup.

1358
01:24:40.652 --> 01:24:41.944
Looks like
they’re on the fifth floor.


1359
01:24:41.945 --> 01:24:43.362
How many accesses?

1360
01:24:43.363 --> 01:24:44.363
Well, there is the stairs here

1361
01:24:44.364 --> 01:24:48.200
and the fire escape's in the back.

1362
01:24:48.201 --> 01:24:50.744
The freight elevator's been shut off.

1363
01:24:50.745 --> 01:24:51.996
Edwards and I will take the fire escape.

1364
01:24:51.997 --> 01:24:53.372
You and Kowalski take the stairs.

1365
01:24:53.373 --> 01:24:54.540
Louise and Chris back them up,

1366
01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:55.749
take a couple of uniforms with you.

1367
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:57.126
Wait for my signal.

1368
01:24:57.127 --> 01:24:58.419
Let’s go.

1369
01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.504
Fire escape.

1370
01:25:51.014 --> 01:25:52.014
Pop.

1371
01:26:09.282 --> 01:26:10.282
Oh, yes.

1372
01:26:11.076 --> 01:26:12.535
Oh yes, I love it.

1373
01:26:17.957 --> 01:26:18.792
No!

1374
01:26:18.793 --> 01:26:20.960
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1375
01:26:51.866 --> 01:26:52.866
No!

1376
01:26:55.954 --> 01:26:57.080
It’s payday.

1377
01:26:58.998 --> 01:27:00.125
Oh, God, no.

1378
01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:06.463
No, please.

1379
01:27:06.464 --> 01:27:07.464
Please, no.

1380
01:27:08.299 --> 01:27:09.591
Oh, no.

1381
01:27:09.592 --> 01:27:10.718
Don’t, please.

1382
01:27:11.719 --> 01:27:13.053
Ready?

1383
01:27:13.054 --> 01:27:14.180
We’re ready.

1384
01:27:16.891 --> 01:27:17.767
Go.

1385
01:27:17.767 --> 01:27:18.601
Freeze!

1386
01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:19.601
Hold it motherfucker.

1387
01:27:24.691 --> 01:27:25.608
Son of a bitch.

1388
01:27:25.608 --> 01:27:26.442
I’m right behind you.

1389
01:27:26.443 --> 01:27:27.527
Watch it, by the window.

1390
01:27:37.662 --> 01:27:39.122
There on the roof.

1391
01:27:48.548 --> 01:27:51.550
Check fire escape.

1392
01:27:51.551 --> 01:27:52.427
God damn it.

1393
01:27:52.428 --> 01:27:53.552
Get an ambulance.

1394
01:27:53.553 --> 01:27:54.387
Right away, sarge.

1395
01:27:54.388 --> 01:27:56.555
Cover the fire escape.

1396
01:27:56.556 --> 01:27:57.765
Just get him.

1397
01:27:58.892 --> 01:28:00.768
You take care of her.

1398
01:28:03.062 --> 01:28:04.314
Come on, Chris.

1399
01:28:32.217 --> 01:28:33.258
Hey, move.

1400
01:28:33.259 --> 01:28:34.801
I said move.

1401
01:28:34.802 --> 01:28:35.802
Freeze.

1402
01:28:45.188 --> 01:28:46.940
Jump, you asshole.

1403
01:31:20.718 --> 01:31:21.968
Six Victor 10, where are you?

1404
01:31:21.969 --> 01:31:22.969
What...

1405
01:32:42.508 --> 01:32:44.510
13 to Sergeant, one central.

1406
01:32:48.681 --> 01:32:49.931
Just take it easy.

1407
01:32:49.932 --> 01:32:52.393
It’s gonna be all right, okay?

1408
01:32:53.644 --> 01:32:55.187
Okay.

1409
01:32:55.188 --> 01:32:56.772
Keep the stretcher level.

1410
01:33:02.153 --> 01:33:03.570
Be careful.

1411
01:33:03.571 --> 01:33:05.364
Phone ahead and alert them.

1412
01:33:12.330 --> 01:33:14.039
Is he gonna make it?

1413
01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.292
If he doesn’t, I’ll
kill the son of a bitch.


1414
01:33:31.849 --> 01:33:33.309
I think this belongs to you.

1415
01:33:37.230 --> 01:33:38.105
For Christ's sake, Walsh.

1416
01:33:38.106 --> 01:33:39.482
It has blood all over it.

1417
01:33:41.067 --> 01:33:42.652
Well, I’ll get you another one.

1418
01:33:47.698 --> 01:33:49.075
I don’t know why you do it.

1419
01:33:51.369 --> 01:33:53.955
You're never gonna change
the streets, Walsh.
