00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:34.569
Good morning, Frankie.

20
00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:36.136
Morning.

21
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.920
Listen to this:

22
00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.531
"From the richest countries
to the very poor ones,"


23
00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:43.883
huge corporations have big
influence over people's lives,


24
00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:46.973
"the environment and even
their democratic processes."


25
00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:48.931
It's the end of civilization
as we know it.


26
00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.367
No it's not.

27
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:53.370
And sure they have an impact,
but so do we.


28
00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:55.024
You help underserved
children learn


29
00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:57.026
and I help people
sustainably garden!


30
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.681
We're the underdogs,
and underdogs always win.


31
00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:03.119
Don't you have a meeting
with one of the big bads today?


32
00:02:03.163 --> 00:02:05.687
A property development company.

33
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.515
Woof.

34
00:02:07.558 --> 00:02:08.951
Debrief over dinner tonight?

35
00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:10.344
Definitely.

36
00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.090
Ross can't come to dinner,
so it's just you and me tonight.


37
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.179
Oh, so I don't have
to be the third wheel?


38
00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.355
Come on, you have
to let me set you up.


39
00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:22.965
Ross has a lot of cute friends.

40
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.012
Cute's overrated.
I want someone with spirit.


41
00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:29.102
Okay, well he has spirited
friends too, Miss Picky.


42
00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:31.060
I'll think about it.

43
00:02:31.104 --> 00:02:32.975
That's what you always say!

44
00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.021
Nothing works when you force it.

45
00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:36.979
I want things
to happen naturally.


46
00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:40.069
Liv, you are the most nurturing,
loving person I know.


47
00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:41.307
You take better care of plants

48
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:43.594
than most people
take care of themselves.


49
00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:45.683
You deserve a partner,
a teammate.


50
00:02:45.727 --> 00:02:47.033
Don't worry about me, okay?

51
00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:49.339
I will find my person
soon enough.


52
00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:51.907
Or maybe he'll find me...

53
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.570
- Here you go.
- Thanks.


54
00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:04.354
So we're still on schedule.

55
00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:06.289
We should be good to start
construction in 30 days.


56
00:03:06.313 --> 00:03:07.749
Okay good.

57
00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:08.987
We just have to make sure
the current habitants know


58
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.249
they have to vacate
the premises.


59
00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.319
There might be some resistance.

60
00:03:12.362 --> 00:03:14.103
Maybe even picketing.

61
00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:15.887
Yeah, I was a little worried
about that.


62
00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:18.151
Especially the
neighborhood response.


63
00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:19.413
I mean we are, technically,

64
00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:21.197
tearing down something
somewhat sacred.


65
00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:24.157
But it's for the greater good.
People need affordable housing.


66
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.159
Exactly.

67
00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:28.465
A community garden
is not a necessity.


68
00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.686
Sure it's nice, but a roof
over your head?


69
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.209
Now that's truly essential.

70
00:03:33.253 --> 00:03:34.602
They might us in the beginning,

71
00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:37.387
but they will love us
in the end.


72
00:03:44.264 --> 00:03:46.266
Speaking of love...

73
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.746
Anything going on in that
old heart-shaped box of yours?


74
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.444
Other than a heart beat?

75
00:03:50.487 --> 00:03:51.487
No.

76
00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:56.319
I mean sure, I meet women,
but nothing sticks.


77
00:03:56.363 --> 00:03:58.930
You should get on the apps.

78
00:03:58.974 --> 00:04:01.498
That's how I met Celia,
and she's great.


79
00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:03.935
There are so many sparks,
I feel like...


80
00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.348
I feel like I'm on fire
half the time.


81
00:04:05.372 --> 00:04:07.417
You should probably see
a doctor about that.


82
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:09.332
That's very funny.

83
00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:10.831
Dude, you've only
known her for a week.


84
00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:13.075
Sometimes that's all it takes.

85
00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.078
I'm glad for you, really, I am.

86
00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.994
But it's just not for me.

87
00:04:19.038 --> 00:04:21.040
I want to meet someone
the old-fashioned way.


88
00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:22.824
Through happenstance.
Leave it up to fate.


89
00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:24.565
- Okay.
- Yeah.


90
00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:29.222
But if fate worked, then 40% of
Americans wouldn't be online.


91
00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:33.400
And there wouldn't be over

92
00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:35.793
How do you know this kind
of thing offhand?


93
00:04:35.837 --> 00:04:38.579
I'm not just a research analyst
for affordable housing,


94
00:04:38.622 --> 00:04:41.973
I'm also a research analyst
for the heart.


95
00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:48.415
What other info do you got?

96
00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:51.287
Well, statistically speaking,

97
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:52.960
weddings are a great place
to meet someone.


98
00:04:52.984 --> 00:04:54.136
I'm going to a wedding
this weekend.


99
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.771
But they come after
bars and cafes.


100
00:05:02.472 --> 00:05:04.083
No one.

101
00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:05.126
At work?

102
00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:08.696
Nah, dating people you work
with gets messy.


103
00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:10.611
Agreed, also the gym.

104
00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:13.657
Is this your way of telling me
that I need to work out more?


105
00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.311
Are you kidding me?

106
00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:17.333
I'm clearly a swole one and I
can't have you changing that.


107
00:05:17.357 --> 00:05:20.925
Dude, the only muscle you have
with any vigor is your brain.


108
00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:23.102
Well, that's the one
that counts!


109
00:05:53.697 --> 00:05:54.829
Hi!

110
00:05:57.701 --> 00:05:59.050
- Hey Gordy.
- Hi!


111
00:05:59.094 --> 00:06:00.269
Beautiful!

112
00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:07.972
All right, is that
lined up there?


113
00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:09.016
Yeah.

114
00:06:16.894 --> 00:06:18.244
Hi, can I help you?

115
00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:20.855
I'm Brian Wolf from RHDC.

116
00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:22.291
Olivia Owens.

117
00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:24.051
Executive Director of
Global Ground Community Garden.


118
00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:25.338
It's a pleasure to meet you.

119
00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:27.166
Your garden is beautiful.

120
00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:28.384
I knew you were coming today,

121
00:06:28.428 --> 00:06:31.170
but I didn't realize
that you'd be doing this.


122
00:06:31.213 --> 00:06:34.564
Yeah, we have been approved to
begin construction in 30 days.


123
00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:37.350
This is just our way of
letting the public know.


124
00:06:40.788 --> 00:06:42.833
Can I speak to you privately?

125
00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:44.966
Sure, yeah.

126
00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.098
Perry, just fix that there.

127
00:06:47.142 --> 00:06:48.883
Yeah, got it.

128
00:06:50.014 --> 00:06:51.929
- Right this way.
- Okay.


129
00:07:09.556 --> 00:07:11.558
I was under the impression
that this was still


130
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.647
an ongoing negotiation
with the city, Mr. Wolf.


131
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.475
Brian, please.

132
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.148
Look, I guess there's
been a misunderstanding.


133
00:07:17.172 --> 00:07:19.174
The city has approved
the sale of the land


134
00:07:19.218 --> 00:07:20.369
and they issued a permit for us

135
00:07:20.393 --> 00:07:21.829
to begin construction
next month.


136
00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:23.613
This garden is a pillar
in the community.


137
00:07:23.657 --> 00:07:25.789
I mean we're basically
a neighborhood landmark.


138
00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:28.705
Surely, there's some way
we can compromise.


139
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:31.665
You can't possibly
need this whole plot.


140
00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.947
You'll be cutting down trees
that have been here for decades.


141
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:35.843
Unfortunately,
it's out of my hands.


142
00:07:35.886 --> 00:07:37.061
I'm just the ideas guy.

143
00:07:37.105 --> 00:07:40.239
The plans have been
finalized and approved.


144
00:07:40.282 --> 00:07:42.066
What am I supposed
to tell everyone?


145
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.983
You don't have to say anything.
That's what the sign is for!


146
00:07:46.027 --> 00:07:48.135
These are my friends and
co-workers we're talking about.


147
00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:49.465
I have to say something.

148
00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:51.641
Tell them that RHDC
is a non-profit


149
00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:54.035
committed to improving
the quantity and quality


150
00:07:54.078 --> 00:07:55.602
of affordable housing opportunities.

151
00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:57.517
Which the city is
in desperate need of!


152
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.910
That's a sale's pitch.

153
00:07:59.954 --> 00:08:04.088
This garden has done so much
for the community.


154
00:08:04.132 --> 00:08:06.177
Did you know that it was
a vacant lot full of trash


155
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:07.744
when my mom found it?

156
00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.573
And now people have access
to fresh fruits and vegetables.


157
00:08:10.617 --> 00:08:12.314
Can't you build somewhere else?

158
00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:13.794
We can't, no.

159
00:08:13.837 --> 00:08:15.554
This is the only publicly-owned
plot of land in the area


160
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.711
zoned to build
lower cost houses.


161
00:08:20.627 --> 00:08:22.629
There's gotta be
some way around this.


162
00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:25.893
I mean, look at all the people
enjoying the garden!


163
00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:28.112
Learning about the environment,
about sustainability,


164
00:08:28.156 --> 00:08:31.072
having a respite from
their stressful daily lives.


165
00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:32.639
This place brings happiness

166
00:08:32.682 --> 00:08:34.554
to every single person
who walks by.


167
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.556
I can see that, but
I'm also thinking about


168
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.602
all the people who need homes
at an affordable cost.


169
00:08:39.646 --> 00:08:41.212
They don't have
the luxury of enjoying


170
00:08:41.256 --> 00:08:42.842
the beauty of your garden
because they're just trying


171
00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:45.521
to get by and survive.

172
00:08:45.565 --> 00:08:49.090
I'm sorry to say, but
it's a done deal, Olivia.


173
00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:50.265
Miss Owens.

174
00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:52.311
My apologies, Miss Owens.

175
00:08:54.574 --> 00:08:57.968
It's up to you whether you want
to be cooperative or not.


176
00:08:58.012 --> 00:09:00.101
I hope you have a nice day.

177
00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.545
He treated the garden
like it was disposable.


178
00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:12.026
Like it wasn't an essential part
of the community.


179
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:13.854
All he cares about
are dollar signs.


180
00:09:13.897 --> 00:09:17.336
But affordable housing
is non-profit, too, right?


181
00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:20.469
He's not a regular
property developer.


182
00:09:20.513 --> 00:09:23.124
No one in non-profit
is about dollar signs.


183
00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:25.909
He didn't care what the garden
has done for the community


184
00:09:25.953 --> 00:09:27.128
or how long it's been around.

185
00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:28.608
He wouldn't hear it.

186
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.392
He was so stubborn.

187
00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.220
Like there was no way
around any of it.


188
00:09:32.263 --> 00:09:34.744
No compromise or other solution.

189
00:09:34.788 --> 00:09:37.443
I was just saying
how big corporations


190
00:09:37.486 --> 00:09:39.836
were going to end civilization.

191
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.360
What did I tell you?

192
00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:43.666
- Not helping.
- Sorry.


193
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.627
I really am, I wish
I could do something.


194
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.064
This guy is infuriating.

195
00:09:50.107 --> 00:09:52.588
I haven't seen you this
worked up in a while.


196
00:09:52.632 --> 00:09:55.765
Well, Brian's gotten
under my skin.


197
00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:57.637
Brian?

198
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:00.204
What's his last name?

199
00:10:00.248 --> 00:10:02.381
Wolf. Very fitting.

200
00:10:02.424 --> 00:10:04.687
More like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.


201
00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:07.124
At least I have
Jenny's wedding to escape to.


202
00:10:07.168 --> 00:10:08.387
What are you doing?

203
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.693
A little swifty search.

204
00:10:10.737 --> 00:10:14.784
Brian. Wolf. RHDC.

205
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:19.485
Oh, he's cute!

206
00:10:19.528 --> 00:10:21.182
Why didn't you tell me
he was cute?


207
00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:22.836
This changes everything.

208
00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:25.491
Who cares if he's cute?
He's destroying my life!


209
00:10:25.534 --> 00:10:26.970
Not intentionally.

210
00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:29.233
Well I'm sorry, I didn't
notice he was cute.


211
00:10:29.277 --> 00:10:30.539
I was too upset.

212
00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.019
Oh, come on.

213
00:10:32.062 --> 00:10:34.238
Even if he was cute, what
difference would it make?


214
00:10:34.282 --> 00:10:36.371
So you do think he's cute!

215
00:10:36.415 --> 00:10:39.809
Now we just need to find out
if he's single and spirited.


216
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:41.898
What happened to,

217
00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:43.006
"Big corporations
are destroying humanity"


218
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.553
and all of that?

219
00:10:44.597 --> 00:10:47.469
That was before I knew the
alleged destroyer of humanity


220
00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:51.038
was a cute single guy
you could date.


221
00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:52.343
This is all kinds of wrong.

222
00:10:52.387 --> 00:10:53.649
Oh, hush!

223
00:10:53.693 --> 00:10:56.130
Don't disturb me while
I do my swifty searches.


224
00:11:02.223 --> 00:11:03.746
She wasn't listening...

225
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.531
I could not get through to her.

226
00:11:05.574 --> 00:11:08.272
I feel if she cares about the
community as much as she says,


227
00:11:08.316 --> 00:11:10.492
she'd understand what
we're trying to do here.


228
00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:13.800
We are literally bulldozing
over her purpose in life.


229
00:11:13.843 --> 00:11:14.931
For the greater good!

230
00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:16.335
You're preaching
to the choir, man.


231
00:11:16.367 --> 00:11:18.282
I'm just playing
devil's advocate.


232
00:11:18.326 --> 00:11:20.502
She seems pretty down to earth.

233
00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:21.871
Maybe you should
just talk to her more.


234
00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:23.157
Why? It's a done deal.

235
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.854
I dunno, you seem
very concerned about it.


236
00:11:24.898 --> 00:11:26.508
Well, yeah.

237
00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:30.904
My intention is never to hurt
anyone, but she's so stubborn!


238
00:11:30.947 --> 00:11:32.645
Pretty?

239
00:11:32.688 --> 00:11:33.907
There you go!

240
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.604
Come on, we were
both thinking it.


241
00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:37.519
I think you should
just talk to her more.


242
00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.042
Get to know her.

243
00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:43.917
I gotta go, I am meeting
Celia at her place for dinner.


244
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.529
She can't cook, but it's
really cute when she tries.


245
00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:49.618
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you.

257
00:13:30.414 --> 00:13:33.156
Olivia Owens.
What a coincidence.


258
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.683
Do you mind if I sit?

259
00:13:37.726 --> 00:13:39.119
Yes, I do.

260
00:13:39.162 --> 00:13:41.512
Unfortunately it's
not up to either of us.


261
00:13:45.386 --> 00:13:46.517
Is this a joke?

262
00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:47.867
It's not.

263
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.260
No, unless it's the
universe's idea of humor.


264
00:13:50.304 --> 00:13:53.089
Then yes, a cruel joke.

265
00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.222
Guess I can't fight
with the universe.


266
00:13:55.265 --> 00:13:58.442
Yeah... I'm just gonna
put my bag up.


267
00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.152
Sorry...

268
00:14:45.794 --> 00:14:46.969
Bless you.

269
00:14:47.013 --> 00:14:48.536
Thank you.

270
00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:52.714
What is that smell?

271
00:14:54.107 --> 00:14:55.935
What smell exactly?

272
00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.981
I think someone is
wearing too much perfume.


273
00:14:59.025 --> 00:15:02.332
It smells like,
what's that flower?


274
00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:05.901
A lot of old ladies wear it.

275
00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:06.728
Gardenia?

276
00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:08.904
Yes, that's the one.

277
00:15:08.948 --> 00:15:10.079
I'm allergic.

278
00:15:12.038 --> 00:15:14.780
A lot of young women
wear Gardenia perfume too,


279
00:15:14.823 --> 00:15:17.739
I'll have you know.

280
00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.567
Oh, it's you?

281
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.439
Yes, it is actually.

282
00:15:22.483 --> 00:15:24.485
I made it myself
with hand-plucked petals


283
00:15:24.528 --> 00:15:26.182
from my garden.

284
00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:28.010
I sell it as a small
side business.


285
00:15:28.054 --> 00:15:29.751
A lot of people love
my perfumes.


286
00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.361
I'm sure it smells great,
just not...


287
00:15:31.405 --> 00:15:33.320
To you?

288
00:15:33.363 --> 00:15:36.715
I'm allergic.
Can't argue with science.


289
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:41.763
I'll just sit as far away
from you as possible.


290
00:15:42.764 --> 00:15:43.722
Thanks.

291
00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:45.898
Oh trust me, it's my pleasure.

292
00:15:49.945 --> 00:15:52.426
That is a really big building.

293
00:15:52.469 --> 00:15:56.082
Yep, it'll house a lot of people
in unfortunate situations.


294
00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:58.127
And totally change
the neighborhood.


295
00:15:58.171 --> 00:16:00.739
For the better.

296
00:16:00.782 --> 00:16:02.218
You know, a lot of people

297
00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:05.700
are going to lose their jobs
over this, including me.


298
00:16:05.744 --> 00:16:08.137
I know.

299
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:09.922
Just...

300
00:16:09.965 --> 00:16:12.315
I'll be fine, I have a plan
and I'll get offers.


301
00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:16.450
But I just worry about
the other people.


302
00:16:16.493 --> 00:16:18.800
They might not be so lucky.

303
00:16:24.937 --> 00:16:26.765
He doesn't really
have much leg room...


304
00:16:26.808 --> 00:16:28.767
Okay, yeah.

305
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.639
Besides, it's kind of
like getting a free massage.


306
00:16:33.032 --> 00:16:35.295
See? It's very relaxing.

307
00:16:35.338 --> 00:16:36.557
More like a car accident.

308
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.734
Well, I like my massages
with whiplash.


309
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:44.478
Hey, if it's bothering you,
you should say something.


310
00:16:44.521 --> 00:16:47.829
No. Confrontation
makes me uncomfortable.


311
00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:50.614
That's not true,
you're great at it.


312
00:16:53.835 --> 00:16:55.750
Okay, I think
I'll say something.


313
00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:56.794
Yes, please.

314
00:16:57.578 --> 00:16:58.797
Uh, sir...

315
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.804
He's pretty big.

316
00:17:05.847 --> 00:17:07.196
Excuse me, sir?

317
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.285
You're kicking my seat.

318
00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.504
Sorry.

319
00:17:15.509 --> 00:17:17.946
<i>Attention to all passengers.</i>

320
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.296
<i>Please remember to
take all of your belongings.</i>


321
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.211
<i>And thank you
for riding with us.</i>


322
00:17:22.255 --> 00:17:23.473
You need help with your bag?

323
00:17:23.517 --> 00:17:25.040
No thank you, I've got this.

324
00:17:25.084 --> 00:17:26.172
Okay.

325
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.307
You sure you don't need help?

326
00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:34.833
I don't need a big strong man
to help me, I put this away.


327
00:17:37.574 --> 00:17:39.663
I'm starting to think
maybe you meant to do that!


328
00:17:39.707 --> 00:17:41.187
No, it really wasn't.

329
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.536
I'm so sorry.

330
00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:44.059
It's okay.

331
00:17:48.194 --> 00:17:50.718
- Your book.
- Thank you.


332
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:52.154
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:52.198 --> 00:17:53.852
I'm so sorry.

334
00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.019
- There you go.
- Thank you.


335
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.991
- Hi.
- Welcome.


336
00:18:46.034 --> 00:18:47.209
That was long.

337
00:18:47.253 --> 00:18:48.994
I'm Olivia Owens,
I'm checking in.


338
00:18:49.037 --> 00:18:49.951
Yes, ma'am.

339
00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:51.953
Is the spa going
to be available?


340
00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:53.259
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:18:53.302 --> 00:18:54.782
Thank you so much.

342
00:18:54.825 --> 00:18:57.524
You're most welcome,
enjoy your stay.


343
00:19:02.964 --> 00:19:04.357
Reservation for Brian Wolf.

344
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.013
- Yes, room 237.
- Great.


345
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.962
J!

346
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.877
Hi! Come in.

347
00:19:48.705 --> 00:19:50.031
The concierge told me
you checked in.


348
00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.404
I've been waiting all day!

349
00:19:51.447 --> 00:19:52.971
How was the ride?

350
00:19:53.014 --> 00:19:54.687
Terrible! I got stuck next
to this really obnoxious guy.


351
00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:56.452
But that doesn't matter
now that I'm here!


352
00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.759
How are you feeling?
You must be so excited!


353
00:19:58.802 --> 00:20:01.327
Yeah... a little nervous.

354
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.241
That's to be expected, right?

355
00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:03.459
Pre-wedding jitters.

356
00:20:03.503 --> 00:20:05.200
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

357
00:20:05.244 --> 00:20:07.811
I brought these for
the rehearsal dinner.


358
00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:12.338
By the way, I think I found
the perfect guy for you.


359
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:13.339
What do you mean?

360
00:20:13.382 --> 00:20:14.688
He's Richard's best man.

361
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:16.951
He's a hottie and he's smart.

362
00:20:16.995 --> 00:20:18.213
A smart hottie?

363
00:20:18.257 --> 00:20:19.736
I thought that species
was extinct.


364
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.825
There is a few of them left,
I promise.


365
00:20:21.869 --> 00:20:23.914
He and Rich went
to college together.


366
00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.588
Why is everyone always
trying to set me up?


367
00:20:25.612 --> 00:20:27.005
Am I that hopeless?

368
00:20:27.048 --> 00:20:29.659
No, we all just want
to see you happy.


369
00:20:29.703 --> 00:20:31.139
And he's one of
Rich's best friends


370
00:20:31.183 --> 00:20:32.619
and you're one
of my best friends,


371
00:20:32.662 --> 00:20:35.665
and if two happen to hit it off,
how fun would that be?


372
00:20:35.709 --> 00:20:36.884
He could be the guy for you.

373
00:20:36.927 --> 00:20:39.582
I have a sixth sense
about these things.


374
00:20:39.626 --> 00:20:41.106
That's the one.

375
00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:45.762
All right...

376
00:20:45.806 --> 00:20:49.766
To Rich, who fell in love
in three short months.


377
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.594
When you know, you know.

378
00:20:51.638 --> 00:20:53.074
I knew I'd know.

379
00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:55.772
And you! By the way,
you're next.


380
00:20:55.816 --> 00:20:57.096
You're going to find that person

381
00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:58.471
who fills that heart
full of joy.


382
00:20:58.514 --> 00:21:00.125
Nah, that's crazy talk.

383
00:21:00.168 --> 00:21:03.693
Have I ever been with anyone
who fits that description?


384
00:21:03.737 --> 00:21:05.782
Also, since when do
you sound like a poet?


385
00:21:05.826 --> 00:21:07.088
Since I met Jenny.

386
00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:08.742
Okay, Shakespeare.

387
00:21:08.785 --> 00:21:12.354
I'm telling you, you're
going to find your one.


388
00:21:12.398 --> 00:21:13.877
In fact...

389
00:21:13.921 --> 00:21:16.532
Oh no, what have you
been plotting?


390
00:21:16.576 --> 00:21:17.968
I haven't been
plotting anything!


391
00:21:18.012 --> 00:21:19.468
I've been plotting a
little bit of something,


392
00:21:19.492 --> 00:21:21.581
but hey, hear me out.

393
00:21:21.624 --> 00:21:25.846
Jenny has her maid of honor
and she's right up your alley.


394
00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:28.675
I'm telling you, she's really
cute and she does all this


395
00:21:28.718 --> 00:21:30.329
do-gooder stuff that you like.

396
00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:33.158
Hey! I'm not that good, okay?

397
00:21:33.201 --> 00:21:35.638
Don't you get it twisted.

398
00:21:35.682 --> 00:21:39.468
But really,
don't worry about me.


399
00:21:39.512 --> 00:21:40.793
I'm finally comfortable
with the fact


400
00:21:40.817 --> 00:21:43.168
that it's just me and my work.

401
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:44.560
There they are.

402
00:21:44.604 --> 00:21:46.649
What'd I tell you?
Cute, right?


403
00:21:46.693 --> 00:21:48.173
Yeah.

404
00:21:48.216 --> 00:21:49.826
- Hey, babe.
- Hi honey.


405
00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:55.441
Liv!

406
00:21:55.484 --> 00:21:58.487
Hey, how was the ride in?

407
00:21:58.531 --> 00:21:59.793
It was awful.

408
00:21:59.836 --> 00:22:02.012
Oh no, really? I'm sorry.

409
00:22:02.056 --> 00:22:04.145
Brian was saying the same thing.

410
00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:08.758
Maybe you guys should talk about
it over a cocktail or two.


411
00:22:08.802 --> 00:22:11.718
Sounds good, yeah.

412
00:22:11.761 --> 00:22:13.067
Brian.

413
00:22:14.895 --> 00:22:16.679
I'm Olivia.

414
00:22:18.028 --> 00:22:20.727
Are you here for
the wedding, too?


415
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.252
I'm in the wedding.
Best man.


416
00:22:24.296 --> 00:22:26.124
Of course.

417
00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:29.170
I forgot something in the room.

418
00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:31.172
I'll be right back.

419
00:22:37.657 --> 00:22:38.658
A little weird.

420
00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:40.529
She's not normally like that.

421
00:22:42.792 --> 00:22:44.359
I can't believe he's here!

422
00:22:44.403 --> 00:22:45.839
Me either!

423
00:22:45.882 --> 00:22:48.233
Why of all the men in the world,
is he Richard's best?


424
00:22:48.276 --> 00:22:50.646
And what are the odds that I get
seated next to him on the bus,


425
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.325
and now I have to spend
the entire weekend with him?


426
00:22:53.368 --> 00:22:54.717
Am I being punished?

427
00:22:54.761 --> 00:22:56.197
No way, you have great karma.

428
00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:58.286
Maybe this is a test.

429
00:22:58.330 --> 00:22:59.635
A test?

430
00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:01.550
I don't know, just a theory.

431
00:23:01.594 --> 00:23:03.857
Why don't you concentrate
on yourself this weekend?


432
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.250
Focus on you and Jenny.

433
00:23:05.293 --> 00:23:07.643
Have a good time,
enjoy the wedding.


434
00:23:07.687 --> 00:23:09.297
You deserve it.

435
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:10.777
Good idea.

436
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.170
How are my plants?

437
00:23:12.213 --> 00:23:14.607
Everyone is watered
and waiting for your return.


438
00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.130
Do they miss me?

439
00:23:16.174 --> 00:23:18.959
Olivia, unless I'm missing
something in a very big way,


440
00:23:19.002 --> 00:23:20.090
they do not speak.

441
00:23:20.134 --> 00:23:21.614
Now go and talk to this man.

442
00:23:21.657 --> 00:23:23.442
Whose side are you on?

443
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.183
Yours, obviously!

444
00:23:25.226 --> 00:23:26.749
He's doing something
that's not cool.


445
00:23:26.793 --> 00:23:28.186
There's no doubt about that.

446
00:23:28.229 --> 00:23:31.624
But maybe as a person
he's not so bad.


447
00:23:31.667 --> 00:23:34.931
Are you kidding me? He is
tearing down the garden!


448
00:23:34.975 --> 00:23:36.324
Okay, okay.

449
00:23:36.368 --> 00:23:39.066
Never mind, can you
just stay away from him?


450
00:23:39.109 --> 00:23:41.416
Sit at a different table?

451
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.896
We're both in the bridal party.

452
00:23:42.939 --> 00:23:45.159
I don't think I'm going
to be able to avoid him.


453
00:23:45.203 --> 00:23:47.248
You have no choice and
you need to act cordial


454
00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:48.902
to get in the position of power.

455
00:23:48.945 --> 00:23:51.165
Brian should be the one
who is uncomfortable.


456
00:23:52.949 --> 00:23:53.994
You're right.

457
00:23:54.037 --> 00:23:55.300
I always am.

458
00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:08.487
How is she here?
I can't even believe it.


459
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.924
<i>Well, that is
certainly unexpected.</i>


460
00:24:10.967 --> 00:24:13.274
That's all you have to say?

461
00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:14.667
What's the problem?

462
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.757
Aside from the fact that
she basically despises me?


463
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.888
Yeah.

464
00:24:18.932 --> 00:24:21.587
Perry, come on!
It's so awkward.


465
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.328
That's where you thrive, man.

466
00:24:23.371 --> 00:24:24.720
Thanks for the support.

467
00:24:24.764 --> 00:24:27.201
Come on, I'm just kidding.

468
00:24:27.245 --> 00:24:28.768
You're both adults.

469
00:24:28.811 --> 00:24:31.945
Put on your big boy pants
and just be your charming self.


470
00:24:31.988 --> 00:24:33.512
You can get through this.

471
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:35.296
Yeah, I hope you're right.

472
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.037
You don't really have
a choice, do you?


473
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.473
Thanks for reminding me.

474
00:24:38.517 --> 00:24:39.561
That's what I'm here for.

475
00:24:39.605 --> 00:24:41.868
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.


476
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:51.312
- Hi.
- Hi.


477
00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:54.663
Your seat is right there
next to the best man.


478
00:24:55.838 --> 00:24:57.013
Fun!

479
00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:01.931
Hi, hi.

480
00:25:08.503 --> 00:25:10.375
Well, this is certainly
a coincidence.


481
00:25:10.418 --> 00:25:12.159
It really is, yeah.

482
00:25:14.814 --> 00:25:18.687
So, you're one of
Jenny's childhood friends?


483
00:25:18.731 --> 00:25:22.125
Yeah, I've actually known Jenny
longer than you've known Rich.


484
00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:24.737
You know, it's not the length
of the friendship that matters.


485
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.608
It's the strength of the bond.

486
00:25:26.652 --> 00:25:29.437
Yeah? Jenny and I were
literally joined at the hip.


487
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:31.396
Rich and I are
basically Siamese twins.


488
00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:33.659
That's funny, because
I have never heard Jenny


489
00:25:33.702 --> 00:25:35.182
say your name until today.

490
00:25:35.225 --> 00:25:37.203
I haven't seen you in any
of their social media posts.


491
00:25:37.227 --> 00:25:38.770
It's kind of hard to
take pictures together


492
00:25:38.794 --> 00:25:41.319
when you live in
different states.


493
00:25:41.362 --> 00:25:43.669
I'm just happy to be a part
of the celebration


494
00:25:43.712 --> 00:25:47.063
and help make
this weekend festive.


495
00:25:47.107 --> 00:25:49.370
Jenny doesn't call me
her fun friend for nothing.


496
00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:52.895
Well as it happens,
I'm Richard's fun friend.


497
00:25:52.939 --> 00:25:54.419
Figured as much.

498
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.857
Baby, we'll figure it out.

499
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.032
It'll be fine.

500
00:26:22.969 --> 00:26:24.536
Jenny?

501
00:26:24.579 --> 00:26:26.625
What happened, are you okay?

502
00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:28.801
Did anyone see me leave?

503
00:26:28.844 --> 00:26:31.194
I don't think so.

504
00:26:31.238 --> 00:26:34.415
I just don't want anyone
to know what's going on.


505
00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:36.809
What happened?

506
00:26:36.852 --> 00:26:39.942
This whole wedding is messed up.

507
00:26:39.986 --> 00:26:41.422
Weddings are stressful.

508
00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:44.904
No, this isn't your run
of the mill wedding stress.


509
00:26:44.947 --> 00:26:48.124
What do you mean?

510
00:26:48.168 --> 00:26:49.387
This is the last time

511
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.259
I'm going to be around
everyone closest to me.


512
00:26:52.302 --> 00:26:54.522
You know how much
I love my family.


513
00:26:54.566 --> 00:26:55.567
It's a good one.

514
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.395
Yeah.

515
00:26:57.438 --> 00:26:59.658
Everything is going to change.

516
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:01.311
I'm not going to be
five minutes away


517
00:27:01.355 --> 00:27:06.404
from everyone anymore.
That makes me so sad.


518
00:27:06.447 --> 00:27:09.015
Don't be sad.

519
00:27:09.058 --> 00:27:13.541
Yeah things are going to change,
but it's going to be great.


520
00:27:13.585 --> 00:27:17.153
You're taking this huge,
beautiful step.


521
00:27:17.197 --> 00:27:22.637
And Rich loves you more
than anything, and so do I.


522
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:25.727
I just like things the way
they are now.


523
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:28.426
I'm not sure I want
such a big change.


524
00:27:28.469 --> 00:27:30.776
We have this huge move
planned after the wedding.


525
00:27:30.819 --> 00:27:34.693
We're gonna be in a city
where we don't know anyone.


526
00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:37.783
I won't have my people.

527
00:27:37.826 --> 00:27:40.220
You'll find new people.

528
00:27:40.263 --> 00:27:42.440
I don't want to find new people.

529
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.097
Do you have to move?

530
00:27:48.141 --> 00:27:50.665
Rich got this new job
in the city


531
00:27:50.709 --> 00:27:52.928
and his commute
would be terrible.


532
00:27:52.972 --> 00:27:55.757
Plus, I can work from anywhere.

533
00:27:55.801 --> 00:28:00.501
And he loves the city, he loves
the hustle and bustle of it.


534
00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:03.635
You know me, I've always
wanted a quiet life.


535
00:28:07.813 --> 00:28:09.858
Maybe you'll love it.

536
00:28:11.556 --> 00:28:12.992
I don't know, it just seems like

537
00:28:13.035 --> 00:28:15.560
such a big difference
between us.


538
00:28:16.735 --> 00:28:20.608
I think maybe I got caught up
in the romance of it at all.


539
00:28:20.652 --> 00:28:22.480
I didn't stop to think
how this one thing


540
00:28:22.523 --> 00:28:26.092
could affect the rest
of our entire lives.


541
00:28:26.135 --> 00:28:29.095
Like where do we want
to raise our kids?


542
00:28:29.138 --> 00:28:30.705
I don't want to
raise them in the city.


543
00:28:30.749 --> 00:28:34.100
I want them to be close
to my family.


544
00:28:34.143 --> 00:28:36.798
You guys are going
to work it out.


545
00:28:36.842 --> 00:28:38.974
You're in love.

546
00:28:39.018 --> 00:28:41.760
That is the most
important thing.


547
00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:46.112
I'm not sure it is, Liv.

548
00:28:55.687 --> 00:28:59.255
Hey bud, what're you
doing here all by yourself?


549
00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:00.692
You should be
out there mingling!


550
00:29:00.735 --> 00:29:03.869
Soaking in the ambiance.
This is your big weekend.


551
00:29:03.912 --> 00:29:05.653
I'm not really feeling it.

552
00:29:05.697 --> 00:29:07.220
Okay, Groomzilla.

553
00:29:07.263 --> 00:29:09.962
Didn't realize things weren't
up to your refined tastes.


554
00:29:11.267 --> 00:29:15.141
Seriously? Dude,
what's going on, you okay?


555
00:29:15.184 --> 00:29:17.578
Okay, don't tell anyone,

556
00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:20.581
but Jenny threatened
to call off the wedding.


557
00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.757
No way!

558
00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:25.543
Dude, I'm sure
she didn't mean that.


559
00:29:25.586 --> 00:29:27.675
She's probably just stressed.

560
00:29:27.719 --> 00:29:29.198
Don't brides always do that?

561
00:29:29.242 --> 00:29:31.157
This is different.

562
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.813
Now she's saying she doesn't
want to live in the city.


563
00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:36.486
We're moving there
right after the wedding.


564
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.208
My new job is there,
our whole life is there.


565
00:29:39.252 --> 00:29:40.427
Why is she saying this now?

566
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.124
I don't know.

567
00:29:42.168 --> 00:29:44.257
I think it's just setting in.

568
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.086
I don't know,
maybe we moved too fast.


569
00:29:47.129 --> 00:29:49.523
If we're going to lead
such different lives...


570
00:29:49.567 --> 00:29:51.481
maybe she's right.

571
00:29:51.525 --> 00:29:53.745
Maybe we should call it off
before it's too late.


572
00:29:53.788 --> 00:29:55.050
That's a lot of maybes.

573
00:29:55.094 --> 00:29:56.680
Yeah and maybe is not
a word a guy should use


574
00:29:56.704 --> 00:29:58.924
two days before his wedding.

575
00:29:58.967 --> 00:30:00.578
I should be 100% certain.

576
00:30:00.621 --> 00:30:04.016
Dude, are you hearing yourself?
You sound crazy.


577
00:30:04.059 --> 00:30:07.323
Look, weddings are stressful.
Tensions are high.


578
00:30:07.367 --> 00:30:08.673
This is just a little fight

579
00:30:08.716 --> 00:30:11.501
and I'm sure it'll
blow over by morning.


580
00:30:11.545 --> 00:30:14.374
If we're gonna get married,
our relationship


581
00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:17.464
should be able to weather the
storm no matter how stressful.


582
00:30:17.507 --> 00:30:20.554
Especially on
our wedding weekend.


583
00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:24.602
So what're you gonna do?

584
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:29.998
I don't know.

585
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.007
<i>Hey!</i>

586
00:30:42.184 --> 00:30:44.839
Is everything okay with Jenny?

587
00:30:44.883 --> 00:30:46.580
Not really, no.

588
00:30:46.624 --> 00:30:48.016
How about Rich?

589
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.322
No.

590
00:30:50.802 --> 00:30:52.804
They're obviously in love.

591
00:30:52.847 --> 00:30:54.240
Why can't they work this out?

592
00:30:54.283 --> 00:30:57.330
Love conquers all,
or so they say.


593
00:30:57.373 --> 00:30:59.593
They do say that.

594
00:30:59.637 --> 00:31:01.595
I want Rich to be happy.

595
00:31:01.639 --> 00:31:03.075
This is his big weekend.

596
00:31:03.118 --> 00:31:05.294
I feel like as best man I
should be doing something.


597
00:31:05.338 --> 00:31:07.688
As maid of honor, I should too.

598
00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:14.347
I know this isn't the
most comfortable situation,


599
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:19.918
for either of us, but maybe
we should call a truce.


600
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.790
You know, for Rich and Jenny.

601
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.838
You're right.

602
00:31:26.881 --> 00:31:30.668
We should set our
differences aside, for now.


603
00:31:30.711 --> 00:31:35.368
As maid of honor and best man,
we need to fix this!


604
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:37.563
Operation Romance, bring the
wedding couple back together,


605
00:31:37.587 --> 00:31:39.415
starts now.

606
00:31:39.459 --> 00:31:41.853
But as soon as the weekend
is over...


607
00:31:41.896 --> 00:31:43.724
Oh, we're back to
hating each other.


608
00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:45.900
Yeah, got it.

609
00:31:47.815 --> 00:31:49.121
Truce...?

610
00:31:53.212 --> 00:31:55.040
Truce.

611
00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:56.781
Okay.

612
00:31:56.824 --> 00:31:59.697
So, what should we do?

613
00:32:00.828 --> 00:32:02.656
You don't have any ideas?

614
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.572
The truce was my idea.

615
00:32:05.615 --> 00:32:08.836
Okay... let me think.

616
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.446
Pacing helps me brainstorm.

617
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:11.796
Come on.

618
00:32:14.973 --> 00:32:17.105
Tomorrow is the guests'
one day off.


619
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:19.760
Maybe we can use that
free time to set something up


620
00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:21.022
for the both of them?

621
00:32:21.066 --> 00:32:24.025
Yeah, I think you're
onto something there.


622
00:32:24.069 --> 00:32:28.377
What can we do to get them
to feel those sparks again?


623
00:32:29.988 --> 00:32:32.773
All I keep hearing
about is sparks.


624
00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.819
I don't get it.

625
00:32:34.862 --> 00:32:36.603
You're kidding, right?

626
00:32:36.646 --> 00:32:38.431
No...

627
00:32:38.474 --> 00:32:41.042
You've never felt sparks?

628
00:32:41.086 --> 00:32:42.914
I don't think so.

629
00:32:42.957 --> 00:32:45.568
I really don't get what people
mean by that, to be honest.


630
00:32:45.612 --> 00:32:51.531
Sparks are... kind of this
jittery feeling in your stomach.


631
00:32:53.968 --> 00:32:55.927
You feel like you're home,

632
00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:01.759
but you also feel like
you're floating on clouds...


633
00:33:01.802 --> 00:33:03.717
if that makes any sense.

634
00:33:03.761 --> 00:33:05.153
Yeah.

635
00:33:05.197 --> 00:33:07.808
Yeah, I guess so.

636
00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:10.637
And hey - you're a poet
and you didn't even know it.


637
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.986
Oh, you've got jokes.

638
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:12.944
That I do.

639
00:33:12.987 --> 00:33:14.815
Dad jokes.

640
00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.164
Ouch...

641
00:33:16.208 --> 00:33:18.079
Well, jokes nonetheless.

642
00:33:19.994 --> 00:33:25.347
What can we do to get them to
illicit those types of feelings?


643
00:33:25.391 --> 00:33:27.088
Okay, what is the
most romantic thing


644
00:33:27.132 --> 00:33:28.350
you've ever done for a girl?

645
00:33:28.394 --> 00:33:30.352
How did you know I
could be so romantic?


646
00:33:30.396 --> 00:33:32.006
Figured I'd take
a shot in the dark.


647
00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.618
Well, it just so happens I
can be quite the Casanova.


648
00:33:35.662 --> 00:33:38.534
I once made homemade chicken
soup, my grandmother's recipe,


649
00:33:38.578 --> 00:33:40.362
for a girl when she was sick.

650
00:33:40.406 --> 00:33:41.842
That's actually really sweet.

651
00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:44.279
I mean, she did
dump me shortly after.


652
00:33:44.323 --> 00:33:45.803
Not because of the soup, I hope?

653
00:33:45.846 --> 00:33:48.109
Yeah, she got food poisoning.

654
00:33:48.153 --> 00:33:49.154
Oh.

655
00:33:49.197 --> 00:33:51.678
Yeah, can you blame her?

656
00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:55.247
No, I'm kidding.

657
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:56.857
The soup was delicious.

658
00:33:56.901 --> 00:34:01.427
She said she, get this:
didn't feel any sparks.


659
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.908
That'll do it,
they are hard to find.


660
00:34:08.521 --> 00:34:12.786
So, what is the most romantic
thing a guy has done for you?


661
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.005
Well...

662
00:34:15.702 --> 00:34:21.926
The most romantic date I've ever
been on was a private dinner.


663
00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.579
The view was beautiful

664
00:34:23.623 --> 00:34:27.888
and my date hired a musician
to play just for us.


665
00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:29.934
It was all a surprise,
I didn't see it coming.


666
00:34:29.977 --> 00:34:31.413
You liked that?

667
00:34:31.457 --> 00:34:33.415
It was beautiful.

668
00:34:33.459 --> 00:34:38.943
The conversation wasn't great,
but the ambiance was perfect.


669
00:34:38.986 --> 00:34:41.423
I'd feel so awkward if someone

670
00:34:41.467 --> 00:34:43.861
was playing an instrument
just for me.


671
00:34:43.904 --> 00:34:47.690
Like, what do you do?
Smile and stare at them?


672
00:34:47.734 --> 00:34:49.431
It's romantic, trust me.

673
00:34:49.475 --> 00:34:51.651
Okay, all right.

674
00:34:51.694 --> 00:34:55.611
So, should we coordinate
some kind of a surprise dinner?


675
00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:56.961
Maybe a lunch?

676
00:34:57.004 --> 00:34:59.572
Al fresco?
It's so beautiful here.


677
00:34:59.615 --> 00:35:01.269
All right, I'll set it up.

678
00:35:01.313 --> 00:35:02.575
You just make sure Jenny

679
00:35:02.618 --> 00:35:05.273
is at the hotel restaurant
at noon tomorrow.


680
00:35:05.317 --> 00:35:07.580
You got it, partner.

681
00:35:10.278 --> 00:35:12.890
Well, I should go
get some shut eye.


682
00:35:12.933 --> 00:35:15.631
We have a long day of bridal
duties ahead of us tomorrow.


683
00:35:15.675 --> 00:35:19.113
We sure do. Operation Romance
has commenced.


684
00:35:19.157 --> 00:35:20.375
I'll see you tomorrow.

685
00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:21.855
See ya.

686
00:35:41.179 --> 00:35:42.441
Hello?

687
00:35:42.484 --> 00:35:44.269
- Liv?
- Jenny?


688
00:35:52.364 --> 00:35:53.931
Can I come in?

689
00:35:58.283 --> 00:36:00.938
Rich and I are still fighting.

690
00:36:00.981 --> 00:36:03.288
He's driving me crazy.

691
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:06.639
Men have a way of doing
that to us, don't they?


692
00:36:06.682 --> 00:36:09.120
Can I sleep here tonight?

693
00:36:09.163 --> 00:36:11.252
Of course.

694
00:36:11.296 --> 00:36:13.298
It'll be just like old times.

695
00:36:13.341 --> 00:36:15.909
A bestie slumber party.

696
00:36:15.953 --> 00:36:17.041
Tea?

697
00:36:17.084 --> 00:36:18.607
Yeah, please.

698
00:36:38.845 --> 00:36:40.499
You texting Rich?

699
00:36:40.542 --> 00:36:42.283
No, just looking at photos.

700
00:36:42.327 --> 00:36:43.545
Of?

701
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:45.591
When we first met.

702
00:36:45.634 --> 00:36:47.941
It was like a fairytale.

703
00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.509
I don't know,
I guess I was silly


704
00:36:50.552 --> 00:36:52.337
to think that feeling
would last forever.


705
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.903
That feeling is gone?

706
00:36:55.514 --> 00:36:58.996
No, it's just been overshadowed
by a big dose of reality.


707
00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:01.955
Well, it is beautiful outside.

708
00:37:01.999 --> 00:37:03.304
What do you say we grab brunch?

709
00:37:03.348 --> 00:37:04.740
I bet that'll make you
feel better.


710
00:37:04.784 --> 00:37:06.960
I appreciate it Liv,
but I'm not hungry.


711
00:37:07.004 --> 00:37:11.095
It's never good to make big life
decisions on an empty stomach.


712
00:37:11.138 --> 00:37:13.880
I'm probably just going to rest,
but you should go.


713
00:37:13.923 --> 00:37:15.055
Enjoy!

714
00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:17.057
This is your vacation, too.

715
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:19.059
Come on!

716
00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:21.931
The restaurant is
overlooking the water.


717
00:37:21.975 --> 00:37:24.021
I'll be so lonely.

718
00:37:24.064 --> 00:37:25.457
Please don't make me go alone.

719
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:29.026
I believe in your ability
to eat brunch by yourself.


720
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:31.376
You might even meet a cute guy!

721
00:37:31.419 --> 00:37:34.901
I'm gonna curl up
and take a little cat nap.


722
00:37:34.944 --> 00:37:36.424
Good idea.

723
00:37:36.468 --> 00:37:38.383
What's better than
having a delicious meal


724
00:37:38.426 --> 00:37:40.733
and then falling asleep
on a full stomach?


725
00:37:40.776 --> 00:37:42.039
No, thank you.

726
00:37:42.082 --> 00:37:43.736
I can't fall asleep
on a full stomach.


727
00:37:43.779 --> 00:37:45.607
Okay, slightly full.

728
00:37:45.651 --> 00:37:47.522
Just let me sleep!

729
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.137
Are you sure
there's nothing I can say


730
00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.269
to get you to change your mind?

731
00:37:55.313 --> 00:37:57.097
Have a great brunch.

732
00:38:24.124 --> 00:38:26.257
- Oh, hey.
- Hey!


733
00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:29.390
This is what you're wearing

734
00:38:29.434 --> 00:38:31.697
to a fancy brunch on
your wedding weekend?


735
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.613
It's an interesting choice, I
can't say I'd do the same but,


736
00:38:34.656 --> 00:38:35.918
live your best life.

737
00:38:35.962 --> 00:38:37.833
Actually, slight change of plan.

738
00:38:37.877 --> 00:38:39.966
I'm gonna go for a run,
I've gotta...


739
00:38:40.009 --> 00:38:42.099
I dunno, clear my head.

740
00:38:43.491 --> 00:38:45.406
You mean run to the restaurant?

741
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.800
No I don't,
but I'll see you later.


742
00:38:47.843 --> 00:38:49.976
I'll pass on brunch, okay?

743
00:38:56.983 --> 00:38:58.289
Dude c'mon, hold up.

744
00:38:58.332 --> 00:38:59.464
You've gotta eat!

745
00:38:59.507 --> 00:39:00.856
I'll grab something after I run.

746
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.423
Oh, come on.

747
00:39:02.467 --> 00:39:04.817
Indulge in a little fine dining
provided by your best man.


748
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.514
Another time.

749
00:39:06.558 --> 00:39:08.299
And you don't have to do this,
by the way.


750
00:39:08.342 --> 00:39:10.692
You being here, that's enough.

751
00:39:10.736 --> 00:39:11.780
Are you kidding?

752
00:39:11.824 --> 00:39:13.018
Come on, it's
the least I can do.


753
00:39:13.042 --> 00:39:15.219
Look, it'll be good for you!

754
00:39:15.262 --> 00:39:17.308
Running will be better!

755
00:39:18.004 --> 00:39:19.310
I'll text you later.

756
00:39:41.332 --> 00:39:42.855
Oh!

757
00:39:42.898 --> 00:39:45.640
I am so sorry, I keep
accidentally hurting you!


758
00:39:45.684 --> 00:39:47.749
I must always be in the
wrong place at the wrong time.


759
00:39:47.773 --> 00:39:50.906
Bad news, Jenny isn't coming.
What do we do?


760
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.038
Yeah, Rich cancelled too.

761
00:39:52.081 --> 00:39:53.518
He's taking a run
to clear his head.


762
00:39:53.561 --> 00:39:54.606
Shoot.

763
00:39:54.649 --> 00:39:56.042
Ahem!

764
00:39:56.085 --> 00:39:57.348
Right this way...

765
00:39:57.391 --> 00:40:00.612
Oh! No, we're not...
this isn't for us.


766
00:40:00.655 --> 00:40:02.048
Mr. Wolf?

767
00:40:02.091 --> 00:40:03.852
Yeah that's me, but it's
actually for our friend...


768
00:40:03.876 --> 00:40:05.356
Come.

769
00:40:08.707 --> 00:40:09.708
After you.

770
00:40:23.678 --> 00:40:25.550
Sit.

771
00:40:26.855 --> 00:40:28.988
I did already pay for it.

772
00:40:29.031 --> 00:40:30.119
Yes, it's good.

773
00:40:30.163 --> 00:40:31.643
Sit, sit.

774
00:40:31.686 --> 00:40:33.340
I guess I could eat.

775
00:40:37.953 --> 00:40:39.172
Thank you.

776
00:40:47.398 --> 00:40:50.792
Well, it is very beautiful here.

777
00:40:50.836 --> 00:40:52.074
It's kind of hard to
enjoy the scenery


778
00:40:52.098 --> 00:40:53.752
while our friends
are fighting though.


779
00:40:53.795 --> 00:40:56.798
We will have to come up
with a new plan.


780
00:40:56.842 --> 00:40:59.192
Hopefully Rich will
feel better after his run.


781
00:40:59.236 --> 00:41:00.846
And Jenny after her nap.

782
00:41:00.889 --> 00:41:02.369
Here's hoping.

783
00:41:03.718 --> 00:41:05.000
She was looking
at photos of them.


784
00:41:05.024 --> 00:41:06.243
That's a good sign, right?

785
00:41:06.286 --> 00:41:08.984
Yeah, as long as she
wasn't pressing delete.


786
00:41:09.028 --> 00:41:10.421
Right.

787
00:41:10.464 --> 00:41:12.161
Well...

788
00:41:12.205 --> 00:41:17.602
Cheers to you for
putting this together.


789
00:41:17.645 --> 00:41:20.561
It is actually pretty romantic.

790
00:41:20.605 --> 00:41:21.780
Thanks.

791
00:41:21.823 --> 00:41:23.608
And I just did
what you said, so...


792
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:27.394
We make a good team.

793
00:41:36.621 --> 00:41:38.753
There you go. Enjoy!

794
00:41:38.797 --> 00:41:40.799
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


795
00:41:43.062 --> 00:41:44.193
Should we eat?

796
00:41:44.237 --> 00:41:46.065
Yeah, let's dig in
before it gets cold.


797
00:41:46.108 --> 00:41:49.155
The chef designed a
special menu just for this.


798
00:41:49.198 --> 00:41:50.287
It looks amazing.

799
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:51.592
Yeah.

800
00:41:52.854 --> 00:41:54.116
All right...

801
00:41:56.858 --> 00:41:59.818
Wow, this is so good.

802
00:41:59.861 --> 00:42:01.298
Yeah, it's too bad
the real guests


803
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:02.536
couldn't be here to enjoy this.

804
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.431
I feel this would
rekindle their love.


805
00:42:04.475 --> 00:42:06.085
We'll get 'em next time.

806
00:42:06.128 --> 00:42:08.827
For now, let's
just enjoy the food.


807
00:42:28.325 --> 00:42:30.022
- Thank you.
- Thanks.


808
00:42:32.807 --> 00:42:36.245
How have you never done
this for a girl before?


809
00:42:36.289 --> 00:42:38.335
I don't know, never had
the right girl I guess.


810
00:42:38.378 --> 00:42:39.727
You never had a girlfriend?

811
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:43.514
Well yeah, just
nothing too serious.


812
00:42:43.557 --> 00:42:45.385
How about you?

813
00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.039
Boyfriends?

814
00:42:47.082 --> 00:42:49.171
Not in a very long time.

815
00:42:49.215 --> 00:42:51.913
You don't date much, or...

816
00:42:51.957 --> 00:42:52.827
Not really.

817
00:42:52.871 --> 00:42:54.612
Why not?

818
00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:56.875
Wow sorry, am I prying?

819
00:42:56.918 --> 00:42:59.399
No, it's fine.

820
00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:03.011
It's really hard to meet people
in the city, you know?


821
00:43:03.055 --> 00:43:04.970
I feel like people either
meet on a dating app,


822
00:43:05.013 --> 00:43:06.413
or they get set up
by their friends,


823
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.408
and that's just not
really my thing.


824
00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:11.411
Too much pressure, too
much room for disappointment.


825
00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:15.937
So I just go about my life
and hope for the best.


826
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:17.852
How about you?

827
00:43:17.896 --> 00:43:19.201
I agree.

828
00:43:19.245 --> 00:43:22.074
When things are forced,
there's no magic to it.


829
00:43:22.117 --> 00:43:23.336
You know?

830
00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.661
There should be
something special about it.


831
00:43:24.685 --> 00:43:27.862
Including how you meet,
how it all happens.


832
00:43:27.906 --> 00:43:29.298
It should be...

833
00:43:29.342 --> 00:43:30.822
It should be natural.

834
00:43:30.865 --> 00:43:34.608
Yeah well, sometimes
it happens naturally,


835
00:43:34.652 --> 00:43:37.568
but there's no chemistry,
or the date is awful.


836
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:40.701
Ooh. Any good bad date stories?

837
00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:43.835
The question is do I have
any good date stories?


838
00:43:43.878 --> 00:43:45.967
Same, yes.

839
00:43:46.011 --> 00:43:48.230
How about any funny ones?

840
00:43:48.274 --> 00:43:50.668
Umm...

841
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:53.366
This one time, I went
on a date with a guy


842
00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:57.152
and we got dinner
from a food truck.


843
00:43:57.196 --> 00:43:59.372
He put hot sauce
all over his food.


844
00:43:59.416 --> 00:44:01.548
So he started eating it,
he started tearing up


845
00:44:01.592 --> 00:44:04.899
and I told him he didn't
have to continue eating it,


846
00:44:04.943 --> 00:44:07.293
but he insisted he didn't
want to waste the food.


847
00:44:07.336 --> 00:44:09.687
And so I spent the entire
rest of the night


848
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:14.735
just watching my date cry
over his tacos.


849
00:44:14.779 --> 00:44:16.128
- Poor guy!
- Yeah.


850
00:44:16.171 --> 00:44:17.608
Wow.

851
00:44:17.651 --> 00:44:19.218
Did he get a second date?

852
00:44:19.261 --> 00:44:20.611
No.

853
00:44:20.654 --> 00:44:23.831
Not because of the
crying taco situation, just...


854
00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:27.095
We didn't really have
anything to talk about.


855
00:44:27.139 --> 00:44:29.271
How about you?
Funny bad date stories?


856
00:44:29.315 --> 00:44:32.449
Uhh... yeah.

857
00:44:32.492 --> 00:44:35.060
One sticks out.

858
00:44:35.103 --> 00:44:38.411
This girl, she was on
her phone the entire time.


859
00:44:38.455 --> 00:44:41.980
And then she accidentally texted
me, "what are you up to?"


860
00:44:42.023 --> 00:44:44.461
Which she obviously meant
to text to somebody else.


861
00:44:44.504 --> 00:44:46.419
When I confronted her
about it she said,


862
00:44:46.463 --> 00:44:48.160
"Your shift is over, goodnight."

863
00:44:48.203 --> 00:44:49.074
No, she didn't!

864
00:44:49.117 --> 00:44:52.120
Yeah, she absolutely did.

865
00:44:52.164 --> 00:44:54.209
It was so outrageous,
I wasn't even mad about it.


866
00:44:54.253 --> 00:44:56.516
I was actually kind of impressed
with her lack of tact.


867
00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.562
I am so sorry you had
to go through that.


868
00:44:58.605 --> 00:44:59.867
Nah, don't be.

869
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:01.390
It wasn't too bad.

870
00:45:01.434 --> 00:45:03.499
I didn't go on a date for
a while after that, though.


871
00:45:03.523 --> 00:45:06.221
Yeah, I can understand why.

872
00:45:06.265 --> 00:45:08.746
Anyways, work is kind
of my life.


873
00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:09.964
It keeps me busy.

874
00:45:10.008 --> 00:45:12.053
I don't really take
much time off.


875
00:45:12.097 --> 00:45:13.490
You should.

876
00:45:13.533 --> 00:45:16.797
It's really important to take
a step back and relax.


877
00:45:16.841 --> 00:45:18.277
Smell the roses.

878
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.408
I know I do.

879
00:45:19.452 --> 00:45:22.194
- Metaphorically.
- And literally.


880
00:45:22.237 --> 00:45:25.414
Lots of beautiful roses
in the garden...


881
00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:31.682
I hope that everything
was exceptional for you.


882
00:45:31.725 --> 00:45:33.118
It's been great, yeah.

883
00:45:33.161 --> 00:45:34.119
Delicious.

884
00:45:34.162 --> 00:45:35.468
Wonderful.

885
00:45:35.512 --> 00:45:39.341
This is our chef's
specialty dessert.


886
00:45:39.385 --> 00:45:40.821
Enjoy.

887
00:45:42.257 --> 00:45:43.520
- After you.
- Okay.


888
00:45:44.956 --> 00:45:47.306
Ah! Don't be shy.

889
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:50.309
Feed him. It's very romantic.

890
00:45:50.352 --> 00:45:51.397
Uh...

891
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.007
It's the way the chef intended.

892
00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:56.271
It's the only way to eat
a chocolate strawberry.


893
00:45:56.315 --> 00:45:58.491
- Go ahead!
- Okay...


894
00:46:02.103 --> 00:46:03.322
All right...

895
00:46:07.239 --> 00:46:10.111
Wow, this is pretty good.

896
00:46:10.155 --> 00:46:12.113
You have some chocolate.

897
00:46:12.157 --> 00:46:14.594
- Do you mind if I?
- No, go for it.


898
00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:18.946
Ah, young love.

899
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:20.469
So beautiful!

900
00:46:23.734 --> 00:46:25.692
I guess I'm up.

901
00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:38.444
And now, for the grand finale!

902
00:46:39.053 --> 00:46:41.142
Oh, right.

903
00:46:47.018 --> 00:46:48.759
I love my job.

904
00:46:53.633 --> 00:46:55.156
This is awkward.

905
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.984
We will get through
this together.


906
00:46:57.028 --> 00:47:01.206
Thankfully I have you by my side
through this difficult time.


907
00:47:01.249 --> 00:47:04.688
Sometimes awkwardness
can be kind of romantic.


908
00:47:04.731 --> 00:47:07.778
You know, that nervous feeling?

909
00:47:07.821 --> 00:47:09.475
Are these sparks?

910
00:47:09.518 --> 00:47:13.087
I thought I was, I don't know,
feeling anxious or something.


911
00:47:13.131 --> 00:47:16.047
Sometimes it can be hard
to tell the difference.


912
00:47:18.397 --> 00:47:20.573
Oh hey, you're back.

913
00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:24.316
The music is very romantic.

914
00:47:24.359 --> 00:47:26.448
You have a beautiful girl
with you.


915
00:47:26.492 --> 00:47:28.755
You make a lovely couple.

916
00:47:28.799 --> 00:47:30.801
You must dance!

917
00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:33.716
I...

918
00:47:35.196 --> 00:47:36.633
I guess he's right.

919
00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:39.636
Okay.

920
00:47:41.463 --> 00:47:42.943
Here we go.

921
00:48:00.047 --> 00:48:02.049
That waiter was real pushy.

922
00:48:02.093 --> 00:48:03.268
He's just doing his job,

923
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:05.139
making sure we get
the romantic treatment.


924
00:48:05.183 --> 00:48:06.445
That is true.

925
00:48:06.488 --> 00:48:09.230
This is something.

926
00:48:09.274 --> 00:48:11.406
The music, the food.

927
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.192
The view.

928
00:48:14.235 --> 00:48:16.150
Of the lake, I meant.

929
00:48:16.194 --> 00:48:18.849
Are you sure that's
what you meant?


930
00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:22.287
I...

931
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.377
I should go check on Jenny.

932
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.726
Yeah, yeah.

933
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.207
Sorry, of course.

934
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:30.512
I'll check on Rich.

935
00:48:30.556 --> 00:48:32.732
See if he's back from his run.

936
00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:36.605
Unless you know, he's practicing
for a marathon or something.


937
00:48:36.649 --> 00:48:37.694
Well...

938
00:48:37.737 --> 00:48:39.434
Thanks for lunch.

939
00:48:39.478 --> 00:48:40.653
Yeah.

940
00:48:43.134 --> 00:48:44.831
Bye.

941
00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:46.050
Bye...

942
00:48:57.801 --> 00:49:01.065
It's like he thinks that it'll
just somehow work itself out.


943
00:49:01.108 --> 00:49:04.764
Or that I'll just get used
to living in a city.


944
00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:07.027
It's like he's listening to me,
but he's not hearing me.


945
00:49:07.071 --> 00:49:08.594
You know?

946
00:49:08.637 --> 00:49:11.205
He doesn't understand
how serious all this is.


947
00:49:12.859 --> 00:49:15.601
I don't know, it must be like
a guy thing or something.


948
00:49:15.644 --> 00:49:17.168
It's like they mean well,

949
00:49:17.211 --> 00:49:20.954
but they don't understand
the weight of certain things.


950
00:49:20.998 --> 00:49:23.609
Like, where are
you guys gonna live?


951
00:49:23.652 --> 00:49:25.916
Or where are you gonna work?

952
00:49:25.959 --> 00:49:27.918
You can't just
tear down everything


953
00:49:27.961 --> 00:49:30.964
you've worked so hard to build
and expect it all to be okay.


954
00:49:31.008 --> 00:49:33.271
Exactly! Thank you.

955
00:49:33.314 --> 00:49:34.620
See? You get it.

956
00:49:34.663 --> 00:49:36.796
Yeah...

957
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:41.758
But maybe it isn't
such a bad idea?


958
00:49:41.801 --> 00:49:43.977
Maybe you guys can work it out.

959
00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:46.414
You do have a
very solid foundation.


960
00:49:46.458 --> 00:49:48.634
I thought we did.

961
00:49:48.677 --> 00:49:49.809
I am so confused!

962
00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:53.160
I'm not sure of
anything anymore.


963
00:49:53.204 --> 00:49:57.338
Well, why don't you
just try to relax now?


964
00:49:57.382 --> 00:49:59.166
I can't...

965
00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.864
Not even a spa session
with my bestie


966
00:50:00.907 --> 00:50:03.475
can unwind me at this point.

967
00:50:08.741 --> 00:50:11.831
What about doing something
cleansing for your body?


968
00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:14.138
You know, like a massage?

969
00:50:14.181 --> 00:50:15.835
I guess that could be nice.

970
00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:17.532
I'll set it up.
How does that sound?


971
00:50:17.576 --> 00:50:18.838
Sounds good.

972
00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.840
- Thank you.
- Of course.


973
00:50:24.975 --> 00:50:26.715
What are you doing?

974
00:50:26.759 --> 00:50:28.805
I didn't eat lunch, remember?

975
00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:37.726
How you feeling?

976
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:38.989
You're quiet.

977
00:50:39.032 --> 00:50:41.905
You're never quiet,
it's kind of scaring me.


978
00:50:41.948 --> 00:50:43.689
I don't know what to do, man.

979
00:50:43.732 --> 00:50:45.734
I really don't.

980
00:50:45.778 --> 00:50:47.649
I'm scaring myself.

981
00:50:47.693 --> 00:50:48.912
The run didn't help?

982
00:50:48.955 --> 00:50:51.175
No, it just...

983
00:50:51.218 --> 00:50:53.220
It confused me more.

984
00:50:53.264 --> 00:50:55.048
Is there more
you're not telling me?


985
00:50:55.092 --> 00:50:56.920
None of this seems
like a huge deal.


986
00:50:56.963 --> 00:50:58.312
I know!

987
00:50:58.356 --> 00:50:59.879
That's what I said!

988
00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:02.316
I tried to tell Jenny that,
but she won't listen!


989
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.362
She wants to have some sort of

990
00:51:04.405 --> 00:51:06.494
big conversation the day
before the wedding.


991
00:51:06.538 --> 00:51:08.279
What did you say exactly?

992
00:51:08.322 --> 00:51:10.455
I said it would be fine,
you know?


993
00:51:10.498 --> 00:51:12.936
Enjoy the weekend,
we'll enjoy our lives.


994
00:51:12.979 --> 00:51:15.677
Everything will work out.

995
00:51:15.721 --> 00:51:17.157
How'd she take that?

996
00:51:17.201 --> 00:51:19.377
She said something about...

997
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.728
Active listening, or whatever.

998
00:51:22.771 --> 00:51:23.860
So you weren't listening?

999
00:51:23.903 --> 00:51:24.904
I was!

1000
00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:27.298
Maybe I didn't hear
all the words.


1001
00:51:28.473 --> 00:51:29.822
Whatever.

1002
00:51:31.302 --> 00:51:32.346
Maybe I wasn't listening.

1003
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.305
Oh boy...

1004
00:51:34.348 --> 00:51:35.915
You think I should apologize?

1005
00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.656
I don't think I did
anything wrong.


1006
00:51:37.699 --> 00:51:39.092
You know, persay...

1007
00:51:39.136 --> 00:51:42.269
But it might help
smooth things over.


1008
00:51:42.313 --> 00:51:44.489
Was I being insensitive?

1009
00:51:44.532 --> 00:51:48.885
I think apologizing is
probably a very good idea.


1010
00:51:48.928 --> 00:51:51.713
How about I talk to Olivia,
we'll figure out where she is,


1011
00:51:51.757 --> 00:51:53.715
and we'll get this thing sorted?

1012
00:51:53.759 --> 00:51:55.717
Okay.

1013
00:51:55.761 --> 00:51:58.329
Olivia, huh?

1014
00:51:58.372 --> 00:51:59.678
Oh, don't give me that look!

1015
00:51:59.721 --> 00:52:02.072
This is maid of honor,
best man stuff.


1016
00:52:02.115 --> 00:52:03.377
That's it!

1017
00:52:03.421 --> 00:52:06.119
Okay man, do whatever
you gotta do.


1018
00:52:07.555 --> 00:52:08.687
Stop.

1019
00:52:11.037 --> 00:52:12.647
- You're welcome.
- Bye.


1020
00:52:18.044 --> 00:52:19.044
Thanks.

1021
00:52:30.883 --> 00:52:32.450
What're you doing?

1022
00:52:32.493 --> 00:52:34.234
There was a fly...

1023
00:52:34.278 --> 00:52:35.279
Got it!

1024
00:52:37.368 --> 00:52:38.543
- Hello.
- Hi!


1025
00:52:38.586 --> 00:52:40.719
We are are here
for our massages.


1026
00:52:40.762 --> 00:52:42.721
Fantastic, the name?

1027
00:52:45.898 --> 00:52:47.334
Those are some fun candles!

1028
00:52:47.378 --> 00:52:49.946
Why don't you go smell them
and pick one out for me?


1029
00:52:49.989 --> 00:52:52.731
You are acting
so weird right now.


1030
00:52:52.774 --> 00:52:55.125
I just love spas.
They get me really excited.


1031
00:52:55.168 --> 00:52:57.170
Can you blame me?

1032
00:52:57.214 --> 00:52:58.563
I guess not!

1033
00:53:01.566 --> 00:53:04.090
Hi, we have two
separate reservations


1034
00:53:04.134 --> 00:53:05.309
under the name Owens.

1035
00:53:05.352 --> 00:53:07.006
One is for a couple's massage.

1036
00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.400
That's for my friend over there
and her hubby to be.


1037
00:53:09.443 --> 00:53:11.793
He'll be here soon,
but this is a surprise,


1038
00:53:11.837 --> 00:53:13.317
so neither of them can know.

1039
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.015
They both have to think that
it's just a solo massage.


1040
00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:19.149
And then the other massage
is for me.


1041
00:53:19.192 --> 00:53:21.194
Where is her husband?

1042
00:53:21.238 --> 00:53:23.805
He's coming with the best man.

1043
00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:26.634
He also has a single reservation
under the name Wolf.


1044
00:53:26.678 --> 00:53:27.766
Does that make sense?

1045
00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:28.810
Uh...

1046
00:53:28.854 --> 00:53:32.423
It makes sense, yeah.

1047
00:53:33.728 --> 00:53:34.773
Sure.

1048
00:53:34.816 --> 00:53:36.035
Okay.

1049
00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.447
Just don't say anything,
Jenny's coming back.


1050
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:39.038
Can you do that?

1051
00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.735
It'll be okay.

1052
00:53:40.779 --> 00:53:42.520
Gardenia's your favorite, right?

1053
00:53:42.563 --> 00:53:43.825
I just found it.

1054
00:53:43.869 --> 00:53:47.394
It smells exactly like
your homemade perfume.


1055
00:53:47.438 --> 00:53:49.048
Smells like home.

1056
00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.615
Just don't give it to Brian...

1057
00:53:50.658 --> 00:53:51.746
What?

1058
00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:52.921
Nothing.

1059
00:53:54.923 --> 00:53:57.100
Are we ready?

1060
00:53:57.143 --> 00:53:58.623
Mmm-hmm.

1061
00:53:58.666 --> 00:54:00.625
Just this way.

1062
00:54:09.025 --> 00:54:10.678
Is your old co-worker gone?

1063
00:54:10.722 --> 00:54:12.898
Yeah, I think so.

1064
00:54:12.941 --> 00:54:15.379
It's a weird coincidence
he'd be here of all places.


1065
00:54:15.422 --> 00:54:17.337
I know, yeah.

1066
00:54:17.381 --> 00:54:19.035
Thanks again for waiting
for him to leave.


1067
00:54:19.078 --> 00:54:21.776
I just didn't feel like
making any forced small talk.


1068
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.778
I get it, man.

1069
00:54:23.822 --> 00:54:26.607
You know what? There's
some really cute gifts here.


1070
00:54:26.651 --> 00:54:27.715
Maybe you should
pick something up


1071
00:54:27.739 --> 00:54:29.480
for Jenny as an olive branch?

1072
00:54:29.523 --> 00:54:30.568
My man!

1073
00:54:30.611 --> 00:54:33.266
Look at you.
Always thinking, huh?


1074
00:54:40.969 --> 00:54:43.059
Hello, sir. How can I
help you today?


1075
00:54:43.102 --> 00:54:45.670
Yeah, I have one
reservation under Owens.


1076
00:54:45.713 --> 00:54:47.585
It's a couple's massage.

1077
00:54:47.628 --> 00:54:50.675
I believe I just saw the
bride-to-be walk down the hall.


1078
00:54:50.718 --> 00:54:52.155
And the other is under Wolf.

1079
00:54:52.198 --> 00:54:54.157
It's a single's massage,
that's for me.


1080
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.072
Oh!

1081
00:54:56.115 --> 00:54:57.508
You got it, sir.

1082
00:54:57.551 --> 00:54:59.118
Right this way, follow me.

1083
00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:01.120
Hey Rich, come on!

1084
00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:02.252
But...

1085
00:55:02.295 --> 00:55:04.428
You'll get her
something later, okay?


1086
00:55:06.038 --> 00:55:08.432
Man, I'm feeling some weird
energy in these crystals.


1087
00:55:08.475 --> 00:55:11.217
Okay, let's just close your
chakras and go enjoy a massage.


1088
00:55:11.261 --> 00:55:13.089
Chakras, yeah...

1089
00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:18.964
All right and your room
is on the left, sir.


1090
00:55:19.007 --> 00:55:20.705
Okay, thank you.

1091
00:55:20.748 --> 00:55:22.098
And hey, see you after.

1092
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:23.229
Yeah, sure.

1093
00:55:24.839 --> 00:55:26.798
So I guess this is my room?

1094
00:55:26.841 --> 00:55:28.016
Oh no, Mr. Wolf.

1095
00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.409
Follow me.

1096
00:55:58.177 --> 00:55:59.918
Uh...

1097
00:55:59.961 --> 00:56:02.094
Oh no, wait umm...

1098
00:56:02.138 --> 00:56:03.878
This is supposed to be
for our friends.


1099
00:56:03.922 --> 00:56:05.793
Oh yes, your friends.

1100
00:56:05.837 --> 00:56:07.926
They planned this
for the two of you.


1101
00:56:07.969 --> 00:56:09.493
To celebrate your love.

1102
00:56:09.536 --> 00:56:12.496
So just relax, enjoy,
close your eyes.


1103
00:56:12.539 --> 00:56:16.891
Oh, that feels
so good - no, wait.


1104
00:56:16.935 --> 00:56:19.111
We're supposed to be
getting singles massages.


1105
00:56:19.155 --> 00:56:20.895
Brian, explain.

1106
00:56:20.939 --> 00:56:23.071
My brain has turned to mush.

1107
00:56:23.115 --> 00:56:25.204
Can't talk either.

1108
00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.205
Too happy.

1109
00:56:26.249 --> 00:56:27.075
But...

1110
00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:28.468
Just let it happen, Olivia.

1111
00:56:28.512 --> 00:56:29.991
Let it happen.

1112
00:56:31.689 --> 00:56:32.820
Fine.

1113
00:56:42.134 --> 00:56:43.440
Now, I'd like the two of you

1114
00:56:43.483 --> 00:56:47.052
to take a nice,
deep cleansing breath.


1115
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:58.237
Let's just loosen up a little.

1116
00:56:58.281 --> 00:56:59.282
Okay.

1117
00:57:00.457 --> 00:57:03.024
Not sure it bends
that way, actually.


1118
00:57:03.068 --> 00:57:06.071
Whoa, ow...

1119
00:57:06.114 --> 00:57:07.290
Good ow?

1120
00:57:09.901 --> 00:57:11.207
Look at you.

1121
00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:12.556
You were born to spa.

1122
00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:14.558
Yeah, I'm pretty impressive.

1123
00:57:18.257 --> 00:57:20.259
This is great, but...

1124
00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:22.000
We gotta get a new game plan.

1125
00:57:22.043 --> 00:57:23.567
You're right.

1126
00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:26.396
We need to focus on getting
Jenny and Rich to the altar.


1127
00:57:26.439 --> 00:57:28.049
I can't believe they
haven't made up yet.


1128
00:57:28.093 --> 00:57:29.225
The wedding is tomorrow.

1129
00:57:29.268 --> 00:57:30.724
Let's enjoy the rest
of these massages,


1130
00:57:30.748 --> 00:57:33.533
then we can reconvene and
we'll figure it out, okay?


1131
00:57:33.577 --> 00:57:35.274
What's wrong with
these knuckleheads?


1132
00:57:35.318 --> 00:57:38.799
Something so small shouldn't
ruin something so beautiful.


1133
00:57:38.843 --> 00:57:40.192
I know.

1134
00:57:40.236 --> 00:57:41.715
We gotta make this right.

1135
00:57:41.759 --> 00:57:43.239
In about 45 minutes.

1136
00:57:43.282 --> 00:57:45.415
I like the sound of that.

1137
00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.464
During this portion
of the massage,


1138
00:57:51.508 --> 00:57:53.901
couples usually hold hands.

1139
00:57:53.945 --> 00:57:55.816
No, we're not...

1140
00:58:08.786 --> 00:58:10.266
I love this song.

1141
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:12.529
Me too.

1142
00:58:12.572 --> 00:58:13.704
Really?

1143
00:58:15.227 --> 00:58:17.229
Yeah.

1144
00:58:17.273 --> 00:58:19.187
You big softie.

1145
00:58:20.667 --> 00:58:22.800
This is my favorite part.

1146
00:58:27.326 --> 00:58:29.676
<i>♪ All you are</i>

1147
00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:35.073
<i>♪ Beautiful shining from afar</i>

1148
00:58:42.994 --> 00:58:44.212
How was your massage?

1149
00:58:44.256 --> 00:58:45.866
It was good.

1150
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:47.931
I could have sworn I heard Rich
snoring in the room next to me,


1151
00:58:47.955 --> 00:58:51.132
but it's obviously in my head.

1152
00:58:52.438 --> 00:58:55.093
You are absolutely glowing.

1153
00:58:55.136 --> 00:58:58.226
Your masseuse must have
magic hands or something.


1154
00:58:59.445 --> 00:59:02.361
Still scrolling down
memory lane?


1155
00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:03.884
Yeah.

1156
00:59:03.928 --> 00:59:07.018
There's so many great pictures
of Rich and I.


1157
00:59:07.061 --> 00:59:09.760
We had so much fun.

1158
00:59:09.803 --> 00:59:12.937
Change your mind yet?

1159
00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.591
No.

1160
00:59:14.634 --> 00:59:17.681
As of now, the wedding
is still off.


1161
00:59:17.724 --> 00:59:20.074
We just have to
break it to our guests.


1162
00:59:20.118 --> 00:59:22.120
It's a good thing we wanted
to have a small wedding


1163
00:59:22.163 --> 00:59:23.774
with just our
closest friends and family,


1164
00:59:23.817 --> 00:59:26.080
or else it would
be even more awkward.


1165
00:59:27.647 --> 00:59:29.388
Shall we head out of here?

1166
00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:30.737
Yeah.

1167
00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:39.355
I think I fell asleep.

1168
00:59:39.398 --> 00:59:41.444
Now that's the sign
of a good massage!


1169
00:59:41.487 --> 00:59:42.401
Glad you enjoyed it.

1170
00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:44.185
How was yours?

1171
00:59:44.229 --> 00:59:45.361
Really nice, actually.

1172
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:49.365
Hey, any texts from Jenny?

1173
00:59:54.021 --> 00:59:56.110
No.

1174
00:59:56.154 --> 00:59:57.721
Look at this photo.

1175
00:59:57.764 --> 01:00:00.550
This is the day
I proposed to her.


1176
01:00:00.593 --> 01:00:04.728
Look at how happy we are.

1177
01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:08.601
Never would have thought
we'd end up here.


1178
01:00:08.645 --> 01:00:09.646
Hey!

1179
01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:10.864
Come on, let's go.

1180
01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:13.084
- Gotta cheer up.
- All right.


1181
01:00:25.966 --> 01:00:27.141
Hey.

1182
01:00:27.185 --> 01:00:29.317
- I ordered us some snacks.
- Good thinking.


1183
01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:32.190
We need all the brain food
we can get.


1184
01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:33.452
I brought my laptop.

1185
01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:34.584
Why?

1186
01:00:34.627 --> 01:00:36.281
Well, we need to get organized.

1187
01:00:36.324 --> 01:00:37.238
You're on it.

1188
01:00:37.282 --> 01:00:38.283
We have to be.

1189
01:00:38.326 --> 01:00:39.478
I've never seen Rich so happy,

1190
01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:42.113
I mean until this weekend, obviously.

1191
01:00:42.156 --> 01:00:43.375
I don't want to let him down.

1192
01:00:43.419 --> 01:00:45.377
I know what you mean.
How is Rich?


1193
01:00:45.421 --> 01:00:47.861
He's been looking through photos
on his phone like a sad sack!


1194
01:00:47.901 --> 01:00:49.207
Jenny, too!

1195
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.209
Okay, what should we do?

1196
01:00:51.252 --> 01:00:53.211
We need to get them
to fall back in love.


1197
01:00:53.254 --> 01:00:54.734
Make them realize
why they decided


1198
01:00:54.778 --> 01:00:55.929
to get married
in the first place.


1199
01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:57.345
We only have a couple of hours.

1200
01:00:57.389 --> 01:00:58.608
The question is,

1201
01:00:58.651 --> 01:01:01.437
what makes someone fall
in love to begin with?


1202
01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.134
Well, I think it's simple.

1203
01:01:03.177 --> 01:01:04.372
The love of your life
is the person


1204
01:01:04.396 --> 01:01:05.963
you like spending
the most time with.


1205
01:01:06.006 --> 01:01:07.854
People fall in love because they
enjoy each other's company.


1206
01:01:07.878 --> 01:01:10.315
Also having similar interests
or things in common.


1207
01:01:10.358 --> 01:01:11.379
Normally I would agree with you,

1208
01:01:11.403 --> 01:01:12.839
but my friends Ross and Frankie

1209
01:01:12.883 --> 01:01:14.643
have nothing in common -
opposites attract and all that -


1210
01:01:14.667 --> 01:01:16.582
and they are totally in love.

1211
01:01:16.626 --> 01:01:18.410
Well I'm stumped.

1212
01:01:21.457 --> 01:01:22.980
What're you doing?

1213
01:01:23.023 --> 01:01:25.548
Searching how to get your
friends to fall back in love.


1214
01:01:29.682 --> 01:01:30.596
What?

1215
01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.032
Sometimes it works, okay?

1216
01:01:32.076 --> 01:01:34.208
No, come on! We can do this.

1217
01:01:34.252 --> 01:01:37.342
We are two smart individuals,
we can figure this out, okay?


1218
01:01:37.385 --> 01:01:38.474
Okay.

1219
01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:41.172
When two people are in love,

1220
01:01:41.215 --> 01:01:43.130
they are making memories.

1221
01:01:43.174 --> 01:01:44.891
That is something that
Jen and Rich definitely have.


1222
01:01:44.915 --> 01:01:46.196
They certainly
have lots of photos.


1223
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.265
Exactly!

1224
01:01:47.308 --> 01:01:48.919
That they both
were looking through!


1225
01:01:48.962 --> 01:01:50.462
Yes, Rich was looking through
photos from their engagement,


1226
01:01:50.486 --> 01:01:52.096
reminiscing about
the good times.


1227
01:01:52.139 --> 01:01:54.185
Sometimes you have to
think about the good stuff


1228
01:01:54.228 --> 01:01:56.492
to realize that outweighs
the obstacles.


1229
01:01:56.535 --> 01:01:58.755
Real love can overcome
conflict and differences.


1230
01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.191
Yes, that's it!

1231
01:02:00.234 --> 01:02:03.150
We just have to remind them
that love conquers all.


1232
01:02:03.194 --> 01:02:05.544
I have an idea.
We have work to do.


1233
01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:07.154
All right, let's do this!

1234
01:02:10.897 --> 01:02:13.030
Yep, all right. Here we go!

1235
01:02:15.685 --> 01:02:16.903
Okay...

1236
01:03:25.929 --> 01:03:28.845
Hey.

1237
01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:32.109
Did you...

1238
01:03:32.152 --> 01:03:35.155
Did you do all this?

1239
01:03:35.199 --> 01:03:37.070
No, you didn't?

1240
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:42.336
I knew they were
up to something.


1241
01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.599
Sorry to interrupt,

1242
01:03:43.642 --> 01:03:47.298
but you've both been
requested in the lounge.


1243
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:48.952
Oh, okay.

1244
01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:51.432
Right this way.

1245
01:03:51.476 --> 01:03:52.476
Thanks.

1246
01:03:59.353 --> 01:04:02.443
Oh, here they are!
Right on time.


1247
01:04:02.487 --> 01:04:04.663
Please take a seat with
your respective families,


1248
01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.143
if you'd like.

1249
01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:13.803
For those of you who don't
know me, I am Olivia Owens.


1250
01:04:13.846 --> 01:04:16.544
I am Jenny's maid of honor.

1251
01:04:16.588 --> 01:04:18.764
And I'm Brian Wolf,
Rich's best man.


1252
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:21.941
Thank you, thank you.

1253
01:04:21.985 --> 01:04:23.639
Hold the applause, please.

1254
01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:26.380
We wanted to
invite you here tonight


1255
01:04:26.424 --> 01:04:29.949
and thank you so much
for joining us by the way,


1256
01:04:29.993 --> 01:04:31.516
because we know that today

1257
01:04:31.559 --> 01:04:35.389
is technically your one day off
from wedding festivities.


1258
01:04:35.433 --> 01:04:37.696
But we didn't have a chance
to give our toasts


1259
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:41.265
at the rehearsal dinner so we
wanted to do something special.


1260
01:04:42.353 --> 01:04:44.921
To our friends and their love.

1261
01:04:47.575 --> 01:04:48.751
Now, umm...

1262
01:04:48.794 --> 01:04:50.796
Normally it would
be totally rude for me


1263
01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.671
to be on my phone right now,
but there is a reason.


1264
01:04:59.239 --> 01:05:00.763
<i>Brian! Hey.</i>

1265
01:05:00.806 --> 01:05:02.503
<i>I'm just calling because...</i>

1266
01:05:02.547 --> 01:05:04.244
<i>well, I've got to tell you this.</i>

1267
01:05:04.288 --> 01:05:06.769
<i>I just had the best date
of my life</i>


1268
01:05:06.812 --> 01:05:09.902
<i>and mark my words, I am going
to marry this woman.</i>


1269
01:05:09.946 --> 01:05:12.296
<i>Her name is Jenny,
and she's gorgeous</i>


1270
01:05:12.339 --> 01:05:15.734
<i>and smart and fun
and so easy to talk to.</i>


1271
01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:17.693
<i>We hit it off right away.</i>

1272
01:05:17.736 --> 01:05:19.564
<i>You're gonna meet her
and you'll see.</i>


1273
01:05:19.607 --> 01:05:21.392
<i>Anyways, I'll tell
you more about it later.</i>


1274
01:05:21.435 --> 01:05:22.567
<i>Call me back.</i>

1275
01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:26.614
I think that voicemail
speaks for itself.


1276
01:05:26.658 --> 01:05:30.314
But I kept it, because I had
a feeling I would need it.


1277
01:05:30.357 --> 01:05:33.534
I've known Rich since college,

1278
01:05:33.578 --> 01:05:36.102
and I have never
heard him so certain


1279
01:05:36.146 --> 01:05:39.279
or excited about anything
before in his life.


1280
01:05:40.324 --> 01:05:45.068
I also got a similar call,
except I picked up the phone.


1281
01:05:45.111 --> 01:05:47.897
I didn't pickup, I was busy!

1282
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:54.120
It was Jen and she was
raving about this guy, Rich.


1283
01:05:54.164 --> 01:05:56.557
You can't deny chemistry.

1284
01:05:56.601 --> 01:06:00.387
When it hits, it hits hard
and everyone can see it.


1285
01:06:00.431 --> 01:06:04.304
It's undeniable and
it doesn't go away.


1286
01:06:04.348 --> 01:06:08.744
Rich and Jen had sparks
from the moment they met.


1287
01:06:08.787 --> 01:06:12.791
Now, some people don't
believe in love at first sight,


1288
01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:17.013
but that is definitely
what these two had.


1289
01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:22.061
The kind of love they felt was
the kind that doesn't go away.


1290
01:06:22.105 --> 01:06:24.847
It's the everlasting kind.

1291
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:28.807
The kind of love that most
people can only dream of.


1292
01:06:35.031 --> 01:06:38.904
It can be really difficult to
forge meaningful connections.


1293
01:06:38.948 --> 01:06:42.778
But Rich and Jenny found
that right off the bat


1294
01:06:42.821 --> 01:06:45.650
and didn't waste any time.

1295
01:06:45.693 --> 01:06:47.826
They both knew what
they wanted - each other -


1296
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:51.482
and they decided to take a
big step, a leap of faith.


1297
01:06:51.525 --> 01:06:54.398
To be together,
for better or for worse.


1298
01:06:54.441 --> 01:06:56.574
Anyone can fall in love,

1299
01:06:56.617 --> 01:07:00.752
but you also have to
choose love and show up for it.


1300
01:07:00.796 --> 01:07:02.493
My parents have been married
for 35 years,


1301
01:07:02.536 --> 01:07:05.496
when I asked them what
makes a marriage successful,


1302
01:07:05.539 --> 01:07:09.543
they said that they choose
to be together every day.


1303
01:07:09.587 --> 01:07:12.285
And like the wedding vows
they will recite tomorrow,


1304
01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:16.376
Rich and Jenny will be together
through thick and thin.


1305
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.553
Because their connection is
not something to give up on.


1306
01:07:19.597 --> 01:07:23.731
It's something to cherish
and to work on every day.


1307
01:07:26.952 --> 01:07:29.781
My parents also have
a successful marriage.


1308
01:07:29.825 --> 01:07:34.046
And they would always
tell me this one thing.


1309
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:38.224
Life is complicated.
It can get messy.


1310
01:07:38.268 --> 01:07:40.183
People fight.

1311
01:07:40.226 --> 01:07:45.275
But you don't throw in the towel
over one disagreement.


1312
01:07:45.318 --> 01:07:48.495
You work together,
you strategize.


1313
01:07:48.539 --> 01:07:52.935
You face the problems head on
and you move forward together.


1314
01:07:52.978 --> 01:07:55.111
And sure, there will
be bumps along the way,


1315
01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:59.811
but Jen and Rich have what it
takes to get over those hurdles,


1316
01:07:59.855 --> 01:08:02.161
so long as they move together.

1317
01:08:06.644 --> 01:08:08.080
One more thing.

1318
01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:13.172
Rich here has been trying
to set me up for...


1319
01:08:13.216 --> 01:08:14.565
quite a long time.

1320
01:08:14.608 --> 01:08:15.827
Long time!

1321
01:08:15.871 --> 01:08:17.829
I'm a bit of a lost cause.

1322
01:08:17.873 --> 01:08:21.702
But he keeps harping
on finding sparks.


1323
01:08:21.746 --> 01:08:24.314
Someone smart once told me,

1324
01:08:24.357 --> 01:08:27.186
that sparks are when
you feel like home.


1325
01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:29.797
You feel safe, but
you're also excited


1326
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:31.843
about what the future holds.

1327
01:08:36.804 --> 01:08:38.937
Home is where the heart is.

1328
01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:44.203
Which means that no matter
where Rich and Jenny are,


1329
01:08:44.247 --> 01:08:48.381
so long as they are together,
they are home.


1330
01:08:53.909 --> 01:08:55.562
To Jenny and Rich.

1331
01:08:55.606 --> 01:08:56.912
Jenny and Rich.

1332
01:08:56.955 --> 01:08:58.043
Cheers!

1333
01:09:09.837 --> 01:09:10.926
I'm so sorry.

1334
01:09:10.969 --> 01:09:13.189
No, I'm sorry.

1335
01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.538
I love you.

1336
01:09:14.581 --> 01:09:16.453
I love you, too.

1337
01:09:16.496 --> 01:09:20.109
What was I thinking letting all
the small stuff get in my head?


1338
01:09:20.152 --> 01:09:21.414
Don't let me do that again!

1339
01:09:21.458 --> 01:09:23.286
I tried!

1340
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:25.027
Listen, we just have
to find a compromise,


1341
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:27.333
something that
works for us both.


1342
01:09:27.377 --> 01:09:28.944
We'll figure it out.

1343
01:09:30.336 --> 01:09:33.122
One hundred percent.

1344
01:09:36.821 --> 01:09:38.388
Congratulations.

1345
01:09:38.431 --> 01:09:39.258
You did it!

1346
01:09:39.302 --> 01:09:40.390
We did it.

1347
01:09:40.433 --> 01:09:41.802
I couldn't have done
this without you.


1348
01:09:41.826 --> 01:09:44.089
It was a good idea.

1349
01:09:44.133 --> 01:09:46.962
Well, I guess we can go back
to being their fun friends.


1350
01:09:47.005 --> 01:09:49.094
Yes, and just in time
for the party.


1351
01:09:49.138 --> 01:09:50.008
It's going to be fun.

1352
01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:51.052
Yeah.

1353
01:09:53.577 --> 01:09:56.972
Well, I'm gonna go hug Jen.

1354
01:09:57.015 --> 01:09:58.364
Sounds good.

1355
01:10:03.239 --> 01:10:04.457
Thank you, Liv.

1356
01:10:06.851 --> 01:10:07.983
Love you.

1357
01:10:09.158 --> 01:10:12.117
I am just happy to help.

1358
01:10:12.161 --> 01:10:13.553
Brian did a lot, too.

1359
01:10:13.597 --> 01:10:16.730
Yeah, it seems you two
really hit it off, huh?


1360
01:10:16.774 --> 01:10:18.036
Don't get carried away.

1361
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.952
We were just performing
our bridal party duties.


1362
01:10:20.996 --> 01:10:22.823
You know how seriously
I take those.


1363
01:10:22.867 --> 01:10:24.782
Thankfully!

1364
01:10:24.825 --> 01:10:26.566
- Shall we?
- Yeah.


1365
01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:39.536
It went off without a hitch.

1366
01:10:39.579 --> 01:10:42.365
And now Rich and Jen
will get hitched!


1367
01:10:42.408 --> 01:10:43.801
Exactly!

1368
01:10:43.844 --> 01:10:45.846
I'm so glad it worked out.

1369
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:47.065
Me too.

1370
01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:50.416
Now I can relax.

1371
01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.679
That is until I have to
go home and face the music


1372
01:10:52.723 --> 01:10:56.944
that I will be without a job
and everything I've ever known.


1373
01:10:56.988 --> 01:10:59.251
Is Brian on your good side yet?

1374
01:10:59.295 --> 01:11:03.560
I hate to admit it,
but he's pretty great.


1375
01:11:03.603 --> 01:11:06.563
We've been having
a really good time.


1376
01:11:06.606 --> 01:11:09.087
But this development deal is

1377
01:11:09.131 --> 01:11:12.873
like a dark cloud
hanging over us.


1378
01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:14.788
OMG.

1379
01:11:14.832 --> 01:11:15.833
What?

1380
01:11:15.876 --> 01:11:17.530
You've caught feelings
for Brian.


1381
01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:22.622
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

1382
01:11:22.666 --> 01:11:26.061
It's complicated, I
mean I shouldn't like him.


1383
01:11:26.104 --> 01:11:27.279
Why not?

1384
01:11:27.323 --> 01:11:28.846
Frankie...

1385
01:11:28.889 --> 01:11:30.978
His company is tearing down
my garden.


1386
01:11:31.022 --> 01:11:33.633
Something my mom and I worked
so hard to build


1387
01:11:33.677 --> 01:11:36.288
is going to be destroyed.

1388
01:11:36.332 --> 01:11:39.552
I can't be with someone
who did that to me.


1389
01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:42.207
I wish there was some way
you could get past all that.


1390
01:11:42.251 --> 01:11:43.817
I don't think there is.

1391
01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:00.834
You look so beautiful.

1392
01:12:00.878 --> 01:12:02.793
- Really?
- Yeah.


1393
01:12:03.837 --> 01:12:05.796
Do you think Richard
is going to like it?


1394
01:12:05.839 --> 01:12:07.580
He's going to love it.

1395
01:12:09.278 --> 01:12:11.106
He loves you.

1396
01:12:20.027 --> 01:12:21.333
Here you go.

1397
01:12:22.465 --> 01:12:23.727
Cheers!

1398
01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:25.120
Hey, there you are.

1399
01:12:25.163 --> 01:12:26.904
I need help.

1400
01:12:28.384 --> 01:12:29.820
Yes you do.

1401
01:12:31.038 --> 01:12:33.476
So, you ready to tie the knot?

1402
01:12:33.519 --> 01:12:34.583
Isn't that what you're doing?

1403
01:12:34.607 --> 01:12:36.305
Good one, yeah nice.

1404
01:12:36.348 --> 01:12:38.350
Coming in hot
with the dad jokes.


1405
01:12:38.394 --> 01:12:40.023
Look at you, you're already
prepped for fatherhood


1406
01:12:40.047 --> 01:12:43.181
and you're not
even a husband yet.


1407
01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:44.530
Yeah, nice.

1408
01:12:48.795 --> 01:12:51.624
Listen, I know I've
only known her a short time


1409
01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:56.325
but I feel like I've
known her my whole life.


1410
01:12:56.368 --> 01:12:59.197
I can tell.

1411
01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:00.938
Let's go get you married,
all right?


1412
01:13:00.981 --> 01:13:02.461
Yeah.

1413
01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.253
Well, we did it.

1414
01:13:11.296 --> 01:13:12.558
We certainly did.

1415
01:13:12.602 --> 01:13:14.647
Operation Romance was a success.

1416
01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:17.128
Ready to walk me down the aisle?

1417
01:13:17.172 --> 01:13:18.477
Born ready.

1418
01:13:42.545 --> 01:13:45.287
Now everyone,
please take your seats.


1419
01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.768
We are gathered here today

1420
01:13:48.812 --> 01:13:52.555
to celebrate the love
of Jenny and Rich.


1421
01:13:59.431 --> 01:14:03.653
Do you, Jenny, take
Rich to be your husband?


1422
01:14:03.696 --> 01:14:05.176
Yes.

1423
01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.744
And do you, Rich, take
Jenny to be your wife?


1424
01:14:07.787 --> 01:14:09.049
I do.

1425
01:14:09.093 --> 01:14:11.661
I now pronounce you
man and wife.


1426
01:15:11.155 --> 01:15:13.897
This is the most slow dancing
I've done since middle school.


1427
01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:16.029
Middle school dances
were the best.


1428
01:15:16.073 --> 01:15:18.293
How does this compare?

1429
01:15:18.336 --> 01:15:19.598
They were not the best!

1430
01:15:19.642 --> 01:15:21.383
No, it was terrifying.

1431
01:15:21.426 --> 01:15:23.036
The guys always stood
on the edge,


1432
01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.387
too chicken to ask
the girls to dance.


1433
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:27.345
Well you weren't
too chicken this time.


1434
01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:28.825
That's true.

1435
01:15:37.224 --> 01:15:40.184
So what were you like
when you were a kid?


1436
01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:45.668
I think my passions
are the same.


1437
01:15:45.711 --> 01:15:50.716
I started helping my mom garden
when I was about six years old.


1438
01:15:51.935 --> 01:15:53.328
I used to watch her

1439
01:15:53.371 --> 01:15:55.895
and it wasn't just that
she was watering the garden,


1440
01:15:55.939 --> 01:15:59.682
but she used to
make people smile.


1441
01:15:59.725 --> 01:16:02.337
Make people happy.

1442
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.557
We had these beautiful bushes
on our front lawn


1443
01:16:05.601 --> 01:16:07.472
and we used to sit by the window

1444
01:16:07.516 --> 01:16:10.388
and just watch as people
stopped and admired them,


1445
01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:13.391
took photos with them.

1446
01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:16.351
I think helping people see
the beauty in nature


1447
01:16:16.394 --> 01:16:18.875
has become part of my identity.

1448
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:23.662
I am rambling, wow.

1449
01:16:26.839 --> 01:16:28.363
Not at all.

1450
01:16:36.196 --> 01:16:37.894
Hello?

1451
01:16:38.808 --> 01:16:41.114
Hey everyone, groom here.

1452
01:16:41.158 --> 01:16:43.334
Sorry to interrupt
everyone dancing,


1453
01:16:43.378 --> 01:16:47.077
but my best man,
Mr. Brian Wolf and I


1454
01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.865
have a special presentation
for my beautiful new bride.


1455
01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:54.040
You do?

1456
01:16:54.084 --> 01:16:56.173
We do, yes, now if
you will excuse me.


1457
01:16:56.216 --> 01:16:58.001
Of course.

1458
01:16:59.785 --> 01:17:01.372
Now at this time, if
I could get everybody


1459
01:17:01.396 --> 01:17:03.789
to vacate the dancefloor.

1460
01:17:03.833 --> 01:17:07.880
And Jenny, would you please
take a seat right there.


1461
01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:18.151
DJ?

1462
01:17:26.551 --> 01:17:31.295

1474
01:18:58.425 --> 01:19:00.166
Hey.

1475
01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:03.474
Look who it is!
The man of the hour.


1476
01:19:03.518 --> 01:19:05.737
You are full of surprises.

1477
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:07.565
I told you I was the fun friend.

1478
01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:09.306
You took fun to
a whole new level.


1479
01:19:09.349 --> 01:19:11.351
- You liked it?
- How could I not?


1480
01:19:11.395 --> 01:19:13.440
I didn't know the funky
chicken was still a thing,


1481
01:19:13.484 --> 01:19:15.573
but you made it work.

1482
01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:18.315
Why thank you.

1483
01:19:18.358 --> 01:19:20.752
So, you having a good time?

1484
01:19:20.796 --> 01:19:24.321
Oh yeah, I just wanted
to get a little air.


1485
01:19:24.364 --> 01:19:25.540
Smell your roses?

1486
01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:27.106
Yeah exactly.

1487
01:19:28.978 --> 01:19:30.608
I was thinking about
what you said earlier


1488
01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:33.504
and I wanted to share
something with you.


1489
01:19:33.548 --> 01:19:34.853
Okay.

1490
01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:41.599
When I was ten,

1491
01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:45.037
my best friend came to live
with me and my family.


1492
01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:49.259
His mother had passed away
and his father was out of work


1493
01:19:49.302 --> 01:19:53.785
and they had nowhere to live.

1494
01:19:53.829 --> 01:19:56.483
I thought it was awesome.

1495
01:19:56.527 --> 01:19:59.878
An extended sleep over.

1496
01:19:59.922 --> 01:20:03.621
But obviously my friend
didn't think it was so great.


1497
01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:06.406
He didn't want to live in a
sleeping bag in my bedroom.


1498
01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:10.715
He wanted his own space,
his own things.


1499
01:20:10.759 --> 01:20:15.502
I tried to make him laugh,
tried to cheer him up,


1500
01:20:15.546 --> 01:20:19.811
but it didn't make him
feel any better.


1501
01:20:19.855 --> 01:20:22.248
It was hard seeing him
like that.


1502
01:20:24.337 --> 01:20:29.691
That really made me want to help
people in similar situations.


1503
01:20:29.734 --> 01:20:31.736
That must have been really hard.

1504
01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:34.913
I'm not the bad guy.

1505
01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:41.137
I know that, I do.

1506
01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.052
But...

1507
01:20:43.095 --> 01:20:46.533
You can't forget the facts.

1508
01:20:46.577 --> 01:20:50.668
I respect why you're
passionate about what you do,


1509
01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:54.367
but you have to consider
that are going to tear down


1510
01:20:54.411 --> 01:20:57.936
the one thing that I am
most passionate about.


1511
01:20:59.982 --> 01:21:02.201
I understand.

1512
01:21:02.245 --> 01:21:03.812
Do you?

1513
01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:15.650
Regardless, it has been really
nice spending time with you.


1514
01:21:15.693 --> 01:21:17.956
It has been really nice.

1515
01:21:21.656 --> 01:21:23.005
I wonder...

1516
01:21:24.397 --> 01:21:25.790
What?

1517
01:21:25.834 --> 01:21:28.140
If I hadn't been working
on that specific building


1518
01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:29.881
and you hadn't been
in that specific garden


1519
01:21:29.925 --> 01:21:35.234
and we just met on the bus,
or at this wedding.


1520
01:21:35.278 --> 01:21:38.368
I would have called you that
same day to ask you on a date.


1521
01:21:38.411 --> 01:21:39.282
Brian...

1522
01:21:39.325 --> 01:21:41.893
And we wouldn't be arch enemies.

1523
01:21:44.722 --> 01:21:46.463
If only...

1524
01:21:54.036 --> 01:21:55.646
I should go.

1525
01:21:59.694 --> 01:22:02.827
Rich and Jenny made it work.

1526
01:22:02.871 --> 01:22:04.699
Why can't we?

1527
01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:08.528
I really wish we could.

1528
01:22:12.402 --> 01:22:15.492
It's been really nice spending
time with you, it really has,


1529
01:22:15.535 --> 01:22:19.583
but I just don't think
I could get past this.


1530
01:22:30.899 --> 01:22:33.031
You have a good night.

1531
01:23:54.547 --> 01:23:57.420
Okay, so if we move
the AC units,


1532
01:23:57.463 --> 01:24:01.250
we can bring the water here.

1533
01:24:01.293 --> 01:24:04.514
Also, on this side I was
thinking of having a compost...


1534
01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:15.960
Hi! Reporting live
from our honeymoon!


1535
01:24:16.004 --> 01:24:18.310
- Are you having fun?
- Oh, so much fun.


1536
01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:19.964
We're really happy.

1537
01:24:20.008 --> 01:24:22.073
I just wanted to call and say
thank you again for everything.


1538
01:24:22.097 --> 01:24:23.141
Ah, don't mention it.

1539
01:24:23.185 --> 01:24:24.577
No, I mean it.

1540
01:24:24.621 --> 01:24:26.338
I almost missed out on
marrying the love of my life.


1541
01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:27.406
That's me!

1542
01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:29.017
Time for you to go
and find yours.


1543
01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.061
What?

1544
01:24:30.105 --> 01:24:31.715
You and Brian!

1545
01:24:31.758 --> 01:24:33.238
What about me and Brian?

1546
01:24:33.282 --> 01:24:35.675
It was so obvious to everyone.

1547
01:24:35.719 --> 01:24:37.460
- Oh yeah.
- It was?


1548
01:24:37.503 --> 01:24:40.289
Yeah, just like it's obvious
with Rich and I.


1549
01:24:40.332 --> 01:24:42.334
Just go on one date with him.

1550
01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:43.901
Couldn't hurt, right?

1551
01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:46.208
One date is all my man needs
to sweep you off your feet.


1552
01:24:46.251 --> 01:24:47.165
Trust me.

1553
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:48.775
It's complicated.

1554
01:24:48.819 --> 01:24:51.604
You and Brian helped us realize
our one small disagreement


1555
01:24:51.648 --> 01:24:54.390
or difference shouldn't get
in the way of something real.


1556
01:24:54.433 --> 01:24:56.696
Grown up relationships
aren't always perfect,


1557
01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.089
things don't work or fit,

1558
01:24:58.133 --> 01:25:01.440
but some people are
worth fighting for.


1559
01:25:01.484 --> 01:25:02.485
Just go out with him.

1560
01:25:02.528 --> 01:25:04.269
What do you have to lose?

1561
01:25:04.313 --> 01:25:06.402
If he'll even still
go out with me.


1562
01:25:06.445 --> 01:25:07.577
I shut him down.

1563
01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.187
He will, trust me.

1564
01:25:09.231 --> 01:25:11.886
But we gotta go, Liv!

1565
01:25:11.929 --> 01:25:14.497
We gotta go.
Just think about it, okay?


1566
01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:15.454
I will.

1567
01:25:15.498 --> 01:25:16.716
Love you!

1568
01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.630
I love you more.

1569
01:25:17.674 --> 01:25:19.328
I love you more!

1570
01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:22.157
- Bye.
- Buh-bye.


1571
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.506
Bye!

1572
01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.148
Hi.

1573
01:25:58.671 --> 01:26:00.717
Hey.

1574
01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.327
Came here to gloat?

1575
01:26:02.371 --> 01:26:04.503
No, of course not.

1576
01:26:04.547 --> 01:26:06.723
Sorry, I know you didn't.

1577
01:26:06.766 --> 01:26:08.899
I...

1578
01:26:08.943 --> 01:26:11.641
I wanted to bring you something.

1579
01:26:12.642 --> 01:26:13.556
What is it?

1580
01:26:13.599 --> 01:26:14.905
Just open it.

1581
01:26:29.659 --> 01:26:31.269
Seeds?

1582
01:26:31.313 --> 01:26:33.097
For the new garden.

1583
01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:34.446
I put some gardenia
in there too,


1584
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:36.144
even though it makes me sneeze.

1585
01:26:36.187 --> 01:26:37.754
I don't understand.

1586
01:26:39.451 --> 01:26:41.453
You made me realize
the importance


1587
01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:43.847
of a place to grow food
and to enjoy nature,


1588
01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:46.371
but there wasn't
any room in the plans.


1589
01:26:46.415 --> 01:26:48.852
I kept trying to squeeze
a garden in here or there,


1590
01:26:48.895 --> 01:26:50.767
but it just wasn't working.

1591
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:55.859
Then, I realized the one space
that was being underutilized.


1592
01:26:55.902 --> 01:26:57.078
Here.

1593
01:27:11.048 --> 01:27:14.399
I added an addendum
to the blueprint.


1594
01:27:14.443 --> 01:27:18.403
I was able to make space
for an organic community garden


1595
01:27:18.447 --> 01:27:20.362
on the entire roof
of the building.


1596
01:27:20.405 --> 01:27:23.234
We were also able to save
the old growth trees


1597
01:27:23.278 --> 01:27:25.323
along the perimeter.

1598
01:27:25.367 --> 01:27:29.284
The city was happy to agree
to the changes.


1599
01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:33.070
I'd love for you to spearhead
it, if you're interested.


1600
01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:35.812
Everyone here
could keep their jobs.


1601
01:27:35.855 --> 01:27:37.074
Really?

1602
01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.945
Yeah.

1603
01:27:38.989 --> 01:27:40.425
This is preliminary,

1604
01:27:40.469 --> 01:27:44.038
and I would love to discuss
any ideas you might have.


1605
01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:50.740
But I'll give you some time
to think about it.


1606
01:27:50.783 --> 01:27:54.135
I'm sure you have a lot
to do in the next month.


1607
01:27:54.178 --> 01:27:57.181
It was really great seeing you.

1608
01:28:06.712 --> 01:28:08.410
It's incredible.

1609
01:28:08.453 --> 01:28:09.672
Thank you.

1610
01:28:11.108 --> 01:28:14.894
I didn't realize the importance
of a community garden.


1611
01:28:14.938 --> 01:28:16.853
Once you pointed that out to me,

1612
01:28:16.896 --> 01:28:19.551
everything just sort
of opened up.


1613
01:28:23.338 --> 01:28:25.166
I've been thinking about you.

1614
01:28:25.209 --> 01:28:26.645
About me?

1615
01:28:28.256 --> 01:28:31.607
There's something
about you that sticks.


1616
01:28:31.650 --> 01:28:32.738
Cool.

1617
01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:39.789
Well I guess we'll be
working together again.


1618
01:28:39.832 --> 01:28:42.096
Not to rekindle romance
this time,


1619
01:28:42.139 --> 01:28:45.490
but to create a beautiful space.

1620
01:28:45.534 --> 01:28:48.014
Which is sort of the same thing.

1621
01:28:48.058 --> 01:28:49.451
Yeah.

1622
01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:53.890
So should we get dinner tonight

1623
01:28:53.933 --> 01:28:56.458
and go over the plans?

1624
01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:00.070
No.

1625
01:29:00.114 --> 01:29:01.637
Okay...

1626
01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.162
I will go to dinner with you
tonight under one condition.


1627
01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:06.685
What's that?

1628
01:29:06.729 --> 01:29:08.818
No work talk.

1629
01:29:08.861 --> 01:29:10.733
It's a date.

1630
01:29:10.776 --> 01:29:12.648
And it's going to be a good one.

1631
01:29:12.691 --> 01:29:15.129
I thought you didn't want...

1632
01:29:15.172 --> 01:29:18.828
Yeah, I finally came
to my senses.


1633
01:29:20.482 --> 01:29:24.964
So... a date tonight?

1634
01:29:25.008 --> 01:29:27.358
Yeah, if it sounds good to you.

1635
01:29:27.402 --> 01:29:29.534
It sounds better than good.

1636
01:29:46.856 --> 01:29:49.163
I can't believe
this is happening.


1637
01:29:57.823 --> 01:30:01.349
You know we may not agree
on everything in the future...


1638
01:30:01.392 --> 01:30:03.525
Oh, I know!
