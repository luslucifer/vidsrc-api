00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:01.983
Hello, Lorenzo.

2
00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:03.399
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Come in.


3
00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.691
- How are you?
- I'm a real mess.


4
00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:24.983
Why?

5
00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:26.983
I don't know which books to take.

6
00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:30.607
The essential ones. If you need
anything, there's the Internet.


7
00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:31.649
No.

8
00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:34.983
I don't like buying
books I already have.


9
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:37.483
It makes me feel old.

10
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:40.983
Right now you look like a little girl.

11
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.649
Apart from the books,
is there still a lot to do?


12
00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.066
I have to do some shopping.

13
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:49.649
Julieta, we're going to Portugal,
not to the desert.


14
00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.774
You can come back to Madrid
whenever you like.


15
00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.442
I'd rather not come
back if I can help it.


16
00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:57.442
Come here.

17
00:02:57.983 --> 00:02:59.191
Thank you.

18
00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:00.566
For what?

19
00:03:01.191 --> 00:03:03.275
For not letting me
grow old on my own.

20
00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.400
You're the one not
leaving me on my own.

21
00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:20.983
Julieta?

22
00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:22.983
Bea!

23
00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:24.733
I don't believe it!

24
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.983
What a surprise!

25
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:32.191
Just last week
I saw your daughter at Lake Como!


26
00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:33.649
You saw Antía?

27
00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:35.191
Yes, just imagine!

28
00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:36.566
We were looking at each other

29
00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:38.813
and I went up to her
because she didn't recognize me.


30
00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:40.607
But you look exactly the same.

31
00:03:40.983 --> 00:03:42.275
Or even better.

32
00:03:42.442 --> 00:03:43.525
And what did she say?

33
00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:47.191
That she'd come to the city
to buy things for her children.


34
00:03:47.316 --> 00:03:49.233
She's got three! 
Two boys and a girl.

35
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.983
Yes, I don't know how she manages.

36
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:55.108
- Do you have children?
- No, I'm not even married.


37
00:03:56.983 --> 00:03:58.983
What a pity, I'm in a terrible hurry.

38
00:03:59.108 --> 00:04:00.899
I'm delighted to see
you looking so well.


39
00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:02.983
Where are you living?

40
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.816
In Milan and New York.

41
00:04:05.483 --> 00:04:08.191
I'm an editor at <i>Vogue.</i>
I travel a lot.


42
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.191
I was at Lake
Como for a photo shoot.

43
00:04:10.442 --> 00:04:11.648
That's great...

44
00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:13.648
Say hello to your mother.

45
00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.899
- Mom died three years ago.
- I'm sorry.


46
00:04:17.483 --> 00:04:18.525
My brother lives here.

47
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.566
We're meeting him and my nieces now
and we're late.


48
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150
What else did Antía say?

49
00:04:25.483 --> 00:04:26.607
Very little.

50
00:04:26.774 --> 00:04:29.317
I asked about you, she said
you were still living in Madrid,


51
00:04:29.483 --> 00:04:30.691
and now look!

52
00:04:30.774 --> 00:04:33.442
Yes, I'm still here,
and I'm staying here.


53
00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:35.983
And did she look well?

54
00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:39.275
She had no make-up
and she was very thin,


55
00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:40.733
but she was pretty.

56
00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:44.191
I'm delighted to see
you looking so well.


57
00:04:44.774 --> 00:04:45.899
Goodbye.

58
00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:53.191
She's the mother of an old friend...

59
00:05:54.774 --> 00:05:56.691
- Hello?
<i>- It's me, let me in.</i>


60
00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:02.733
Hello.

61
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.150
Are you all right?

62
00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:05.691
I'm boiling water...

63
00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:08.233
I rang last night and you didn't answer.

64
00:06:08.566 --> 00:06:10.317
I needed to be alone.

65
00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:13.900
Have you finished
with the cases and the boxes?


66
00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:18.483
I've unpacked everything.

67
00:06:19.608 --> 00:06:20.941
I'm staying in Madrid.

68
00:06:22.608 --> 00:06:23.983
Are you joking?

69
00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:26.649
That's ridiculous!

70
00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:28.275
I can't go with you.

71
00:06:28.442 --> 00:06:29.525
Why? What's happened?

72
00:06:30.192 --> 00:06:33.941
I know you don't deserve this,
but please don't ask any questions.


73
00:06:35.983 --> 00:06:39.358
I'm not going with you to Portugal.
I'm staying in Madrid.


74
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.358
What's going on?

75
00:06:41.774 --> 00:06:43.275
I've thought it over and...

76
00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:47.858
You must have thought it over before!
We've been planning this for a year!


77
00:06:48.192 --> 00:06:50.858
Just yesterday you said
you'd rather not come back.


78
00:06:50.983 --> 00:06:52.691
What's happened so suddenly?

79
00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:54.442
Don't insist, please.

80
00:06:55.108 --> 00:06:56.566
Could I have a glass of water?

81
00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:03.066
I don't recognize you.
You're behaving like a lunatic.


82
00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:05.108
I know.

83
00:07:09.774 --> 00:07:11.983
I can't believe this conversation.

84
00:07:16.317 --> 00:07:18.317
Last night I realized
I was fooling myself.


85
00:07:18.816 --> 00:07:20.108
I don't want to leave Madrid.

86
00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:24.400
And I'd rather be on my own.

87
00:07:26.317 --> 00:07:29.566
I always knew there was
something important in your life


88
00:07:31.108 --> 00:07:32.983
that you never shared with me.

89
00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:35.566
You never wanted to talk about it

90
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.900
and I always respected that.

91
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.733
I'd like you to keep respecting it.

92
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.484
Hello, Inocencio.

93
00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:23.566
Miss Julieta!

94
00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:25.900
- It's been ages!
- Yes, indeed.


95
00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:28.357
By chance, have any letters come for me?

96
00:08:28.816 --> 00:08:31.150
In all these years? No.

97
00:08:31.317 --> 00:08:35.608
I've moved back to Madrid.
Is my old apartment free?


98
00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.442
No. I thought you'd left Spain.

99
00:08:38.816 --> 00:08:42.900
Yes, but I've come back,
and I miss this street.


100
00:08:43.108 --> 00:08:44.388
Is there another apartment free?

101
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.192
There's one on the second floor.

102
00:08:47.608 --> 00:08:49.733
That's wonderful! Can I see it?

103
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.900
There's no furniture
and it has to be painted.


104
00:08:52.108 --> 00:08:53.108
That's okay.

105
00:08:54.442 --> 00:08:55.816
I'll get the key.

106
00:08:59.983 --> 00:09:01.983
It's a bit of a mess.

107
00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:14.649
I'll take it.

108
00:09:15.317 --> 00:09:17.359
But it's not ready yet.

109
00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:19.649
If you give me your number,
I'll call you.


110
00:09:19.816 --> 00:09:20.983
Don't worry.

111
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.108
If the kitchen and the bathroom work,
I'll see to the rest.


112
00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:26.442
They're brand new.

113
00:09:27.816 --> 00:09:29.025
Wonderful.

114
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.900
<i>Antía.</i>

115
00:10:37.983 --> 00:10:40.108
<i>Two sons and a daughter.</i>

116
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.150
<i>She went down to Lake Como to shop.</i>

117
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.733
<i>Maybe she lives nearby,
in a Swiss town that's expensive</i>


118
00:10:48.983 --> 00:10:51.983
<i>and she went shopping in Italy
which is much cheaper.</i>


119
00:10:53.608 --> 00:10:54.816
<i>She doesn't wear make-up.</i>

120
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.025
<i>She's thin.</i>

121
00:11:01.442 --> 00:11:03.775
<i>She thinks I still live in Madrid.</i>

122
00:12:50.359 --> 00:12:51.733
<i>Dear Antía,</i>

123
00:12:53.108 --> 00:12:56.317
<i>I'm going to tell you
everything I wasn't able to tell you,</i>


124
00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:58.025
<i>because you were a child,</i>

125
00:12:58.983 --> 00:13:01.234
<i>because it was too painful for me,</i>

126
00:13:02.108 --> 00:13:03.566
<i>or simply out of shame.</i>

127
00:13:05.234 --> 00:13:07.150
<i>But you're not a child anymore.</i>

128
00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:10.775
<i>Beatriz told me
that you have children of your own.</i>


129
00:13:11.983 --> 00:13:13.733
<i>Three, no less.</i>

130
00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:16.942
<i>You're a grown woman,</i>

131
00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:18.608
<i>and a mother.</i>

132
00:13:23.442 --> 00:13:24.900
<i>Where do I begin?</i>

133
00:13:26.983 --> 00:13:28.442
<i>I'll tell you about your father.</i>

134
00:13:29.484 --> 00:13:32.983
<i>When you asked me how I met him,
I told you it was on a train.</i>


135
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.234
<i>But I didn't tell you everything.</i>

136
00:13:36.442 --> 00:13:38.691
<i>I was 25.</i>

137
00:13:38.942 --> 00:13:42.025
<i>It was an unpleasant
night and very windy.</i>


138
00:13:48.817 --> 00:13:50.317
Is this seat free?

139
00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:52.401
Yes.

140
00:14:06.317 --> 00:14:08.359
That branch was really something.

141
00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:12.942
Did it scare you?

142
00:14:13.817 --> 00:14:14.817
Yes.

143
00:14:17.526 --> 00:14:18.900
Are you traveling alone?

144
00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:21.109
Yes.

145
00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:27.983
When I saw you alone I thought,
"We'll keep each other company."


146
00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:34.484
You don't want to talk.

147
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.109
What a pity.

148
00:14:41.817 --> 00:14:43.150
Excuse me, I have to go out.

149
00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:29.401
I hope he doesn't come
too close to the train.


150
00:15:30.984 --> 00:15:32.608
He isn't afraid of it.

151
00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:35.692
He's looking for a female.

152
00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:38.025
He smells her on the air.

153
00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:40.900
Would you like a drink?

154
00:15:45.526 --> 00:15:47.317
<i>Xoan told me his name was Xoan</i>

155
00:15:47.484 --> 00:15:49.401
<i>and I said mine was Julieta.</i>

156
00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:52.401
<i>He told me he was married.</i>

157
00:15:52.817 --> 00:15:56.317
<i>Ana, his wife,
had been in a coma for five years.</i>


158
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.317
<i>I told him that I was teaching
Classical Studies,</i>


159
00:16:00.484 --> 00:16:03.401
<i>substituting for a teacher who was ill.</i>

160
00:16:04.858 --> 00:16:06.775
<i>Xoan told me that he was a fisherman,</i>

161
00:16:07.109 --> 00:16:08.692
<i>that he had three small boats.</i>

162
00:16:10.192 --> 00:16:13.109
<i>He was going to Madrid
to buy an engine for one of them.</i>


163
00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:17.526
<i>He had lived his
entire life by the sea,</i>

164
00:16:18.025 --> 00:16:21.317
<i>in the house his grandfather bought
when he came back from Cuba.</i>


165
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.984
10-minute stop!

166
00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:52.192
Do you feel like stretching your legs?

167
00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:55.608
I haven't got my coat, but thank you.

168
00:16:58.401 --> 00:16:59.692
See you later.

169
00:17:14.775 --> 00:17:16.441
Greek tragedy

170
00:17:54.317 --> 00:17:55.608
My God, what happened?

171
00:17:55.817 --> 00:17:56.984
The train's stopped.

172
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.567
Why? Just like that?

173
00:17:58.733 --> 00:17:59.984
Please, go back inside.

174
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:01.151
Don't worry.

175
00:18:01.234 --> 00:18:03.733
A bag fell on my head
and nearly killed me.


176
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.900
We've hit something.

177
00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:08.276
I saw a stag running
alongside the train.


178
00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:10.317
What an idea!

179
00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:12.401
Yes, I saw it, too.

180
00:18:12.526 --> 00:18:14.276
No, we didn't hit anything.

181
00:18:14.442 --> 00:18:17.317
Please, go back to your seats
and clear the corridor.


182
00:18:17.484 --> 00:18:19.359
The train is about to move again.

183
00:18:19.526 --> 00:18:20.567
Well, I saw a stag.

184
00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:22.817
So did I and
I'm not making a fuss.

185
00:18:27.192 --> 00:18:28.984
Did you see the man sitting here?

186
00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.984
With glasses and a black sweater?

187
00:18:31.317 --> 00:18:32.733
Yes, I saw him in the corridor.

188
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.317
He must be around.

189
00:18:34.733 --> 00:18:36.317
When we stopped, he got out.

190
00:18:36.484 --> 00:18:40.526
I saw him walking in the snow. I noticed
him because he didn't have a coat.


191
00:18:40.692 --> 00:18:42.151
I think he was drunk.

192
00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:46.276
He's probably still wandering around.
That's why we've stopped.


193
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:46.817
Take this.

194
00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:50.984
Get back inside! 
You'll catch pneumonia.

195
00:19:51.067 --> 00:19:52.192
What's on the stretcher?

196
00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:53.317
What?

197
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.401
Is it the stag?

198
00:19:55.151 --> 00:19:56.526
No, why do you say that?

199
00:19:56.608 --> 00:19:57.608
Is it a man?

200
00:19:58.151 --> 00:19:59.151
Go inside.

201
00:19:59.317 --> 00:20:00.443
Is it him?

202
00:20:00.484 --> 00:20:01.817
Is that why we stopped?

203
00:20:03.234 --> 00:20:04.734
A man in a black sweater.

204
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:07.692
He had glasses.

205
00:20:09.067 --> 00:20:10.567
Please, get on the train.

206
00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:20.109
He was sitting where you are now.

207
00:20:21.984 --> 00:20:24.151
He wanted to talk,

208
00:20:24.942 --> 00:20:27.401
but I didn't like how
he was looking at me


209
00:20:28.151 --> 00:20:29.401
and I ran out.

210
00:20:30.608 --> 00:20:32.942
How could I have
known he felt so bad?

211
00:20:33.151 --> 00:20:34.817
Any girl would have done the same.

212
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.151
I should have realized.

213
00:20:37.401 --> 00:20:40.151
Don't torture yourself.
He'd still have killed himself.


214
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.109
Why did he have an empty bag?

215
00:20:42.942 --> 00:20:44.151
I don't know.

216
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:47.318
I guess he didn't want
to attract attention.


217
00:20:47.942 --> 00:20:50.484
But he had it all planned
before he got on the train.


218
00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:54.650
No one kills himself because a girl,
even one as pretty as you,


219
00:20:54.817 --> 00:20:56.151
doesn't want to talk to him.

220
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.484
I can't sleep.

221
00:21:54.484 --> 00:21:56.151
Neither can I.

222
00:22:50.775 --> 00:22:54.151
<i>Thalassa, hals</i> and <i>pontos.</i>

223
00:22:54.318 --> 00:22:57.318
The three words mean sea in Greek.

224
00:22:57.567 --> 00:22:59.567
<i>Pontos</i> is sea and high sea.

225
00:22:59.942 --> 00:23:03.109
And it refers to the sea as a road,
the road to adventure.


226
00:23:03.276 --> 00:23:06.276
That's why Ulysses
is the maritime hero par excellence.


227
00:23:06.443 --> 00:23:09.984
For example, when Ulysses
arrived on Calypso's island,


228
00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:12.151
exhausted after a shipwreck,

229
00:23:12.942 --> 00:23:16.567
the nymph Calypso,
who was a real stunner...


230
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.775
Marcos,

231
00:23:17.817 --> 00:23:19.650
who do you think
is the most beautiful woman?


232
00:23:19.775 --> 00:23:20.775
You.

233
00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:23.817
That's no good, because I'm the teacher

234
00:23:23.984 --> 00:23:26.318
and teachers aren't supposed
to have sex with their pupils.


235
00:23:26.484 --> 00:23:28.650
- Tell me someone else.
- Kim Basinger.


236
00:23:28.984 --> 00:23:29.984
Really lovely.

237
00:23:30.067 --> 00:23:31.942
Much prettier than me, toady!

238
00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:33.067
Ángela Molina.

239
00:23:33.151 --> 00:23:34.567
She's beautiful, too.

240
00:23:34.775 --> 00:23:38.775
Well, Calypso was as beautiful as Kim
Basinger and Ángela Molina together.


241
00:23:38.901 --> 00:23:41.901
And she offered Ulysses
everything you could imagine.


242
00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:44.193
Diego,

243
00:23:44.276 --> 00:23:46.984
what could she have offered him?

244
00:23:47.234 --> 00:23:48.318
Her body.

245
00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:49.775
Of course.

246
00:23:49.817 --> 00:23:52.276
And what else?
Something we've all dreamed of...


247
00:23:52.443 --> 00:23:54.276
- Eternal youth.
- Exactly.


248
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.567
And immortality.

249
00:23:57.067 --> 00:23:59.817
Yet Ulysses rejected it

250
00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:03.942
and he set sail to
face countless dangers.


251
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.318
Which of the three meanings
would you choose


252
00:24:07.485 --> 00:24:09.942
for the sea that Ulysses yearned for?

253
00:24:10.318 --> 00:24:11.318
<i>Thalassa?</i>

254
00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:12.485
No!

255
00:24:12.526 --> 00:24:14.485
<i>- Pontos.</i>
- That's it!


256
00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:16.817
<i>Pontos,</i> the sea, the high sea,

257
00:24:17.276 --> 00:24:19.817
the road to adventure and the unknown.

258
00:24:31.901 --> 00:24:32.901
Come in.

259
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:36.901
Hello.

260
00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:38.567
Julieta, have a seat.

261
00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:42.485
Thank you.

262
00:24:43.485 --> 00:24:46.650
Mrs. Martínez is coming back next week

263
00:24:46.817 --> 00:24:48.984
so your substitution time is over.

264
00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:53.817
We are very happy with your work.
Very happy indeed.


265
00:24:54.234 --> 00:24:57.401
There's never been such attendance
in the Classical Literature classes.


266
00:24:57.984 --> 00:24:59.359
Thank you.

267
00:24:59.567 --> 00:25:01.443
I've really enjoyed these six months.

268
00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:03.026
I'm delighted.

269
00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:04.401
Well...

270
00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:05.817
Wait.

271
00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:09.901
This letter came, it's for you.

272
00:25:14.318 --> 00:25:15.485
Is it for you?

273
00:25:16.485 --> 00:25:18.151
Yes, it is.

274
00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:20.817
<i>Dear Julieta,</i>

275
00:25:21.193 --> 00:25:23.567
<i>I don't know
if you're still working at the school.</i>


276
00:25:24.026 --> 00:25:26.984
<i>I hope so, because it's the only address
I have for you.</i>


277
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:30.151
<i>I think about you a lot.</i>

278
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.234
<i>I can't get that night on the train
out of my head.</i>


279
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.567
<i>Ana is still the same, or worse.</i>

280
00:25:36.151 --> 00:25:39.151
<i>I was only away for two days,
but she looked worse on my return.</i>


281
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.901
<i>When you're there all the time,
you don't realize.</i>


282
00:25:44.151 --> 00:25:45.817
<i>I didn't go fishing today.</i>

283
00:25:45.984 --> 00:25:48.984
<i>The sea is very choppy
and there'll be a storm this afternoon.</i>


284
00:25:50.318 --> 00:25:52.567
<i>I'd like to see you
appearing through the rain,</i>


285
00:25:53.026 --> 00:25:54.984
<i>looking for a place to shelter,</i>

286
00:25:55.859 --> 00:25:57.817
<i>and that my home were that place.</i>

287
00:26:02.485 --> 00:26:03.526
Look at you!

288
00:26:06.984 --> 00:26:08.485
Canelo, don't be a nuisance.

289
00:26:09.151 --> 00:26:10.193
Hello.

290
00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:13.485
I think you're late.
The funeral was yesterday.


291
00:26:14.692 --> 00:26:16.485
But come in and have some coffee.

292
00:26:17.234 --> 00:26:18.567
I'm in charge of the house.

293
00:26:18.859 --> 00:26:20.234
Come on, Canelo!

294
00:26:25.234 --> 00:26:26.526
Leave it there.

295
00:26:26.692 --> 00:26:28.151
We'll go into the kitchen.

296
00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:31.026
When did you meet Ana?

297
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.526
Ana? I didn't know her.

298
00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:34.609
I supposed so.

299
00:26:34.734 --> 00:26:37.151
She was in bed the last six years.

300
00:26:38.567 --> 00:26:40.026
The sea!

301
00:26:42.026 --> 00:26:43.901
It's really striking the first time.

302
00:26:44.026 --> 00:26:45.068
Sit down.

303
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:48.485
So you've come to see Xoan.

304
00:26:52.026 --> 00:26:53.151
Do you want a cookie?

305
00:26:53.234 --> 00:26:54.318
No.

306
00:26:55.151 --> 00:26:56.692
I don't think he'll be back tonight.

307
00:26:56.984 --> 00:26:58.318
He's with Ava.

308
00:26:59.234 --> 00:27:00.360
Do you know Ava?

309
00:27:02.234 --> 00:27:04.151
She does ceramics and sculptures.

310
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:07.734
Ana and Ava were good friends,

311
00:27:08.734 --> 00:27:11.234
when Ana could still talk or listen.

312
00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:14.485
The poor thing was a vegetable,

313
00:27:14.651 --> 00:27:16.734
and a man needs a woman.

314
00:27:20.651 --> 00:27:22.651
But it's not for me to criticize Xoan.

315
00:27:24.485 --> 00:27:25.651
More coffee?

316
00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:30.651
- No.
- Then give me the cup.


317
00:27:34.151 --> 00:27:36.234
So what are you going to do?

318
00:27:36.984 --> 00:27:38.859
You can still catch the 8:00 bus.

319
00:27:39.485 --> 00:27:40.984
It stops in the square.

320
00:27:42.651 --> 00:27:43.651
Let's go.

321
00:27:44.817 --> 00:27:47.417
You can come home with me
and my husband will take you to the bus.


322
00:27:47.526 --> 00:27:48.859
It's no bother.

323
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:50.692
I'm tired.

324
00:27:51.526 --> 00:27:53.817
I'd rather wait here, if you don't mind.

325
00:27:54.026 --> 00:27:55.151
Where?

326
00:27:56.026 --> 00:27:57.567
Right there, in the entrance.

327
00:27:58.651 --> 00:27:59.692
On your own?

328
00:28:00.485 --> 00:28:01.485
Well...

329
00:28:04.235 --> 00:28:06.026
I'd stay with you, but I can't.

330
00:28:06.235 --> 00:28:08.485
I've neglected my
husband these last days.


331
00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:10.901
Well,

332
00:28:11.984 --> 00:28:14.318
Canelo will keep you company.

333
00:28:15.984 --> 00:28:17.026
Thank you.

334
00:28:17.817 --> 00:28:20.151
Don't fall asleep and miss the bus.

335
00:28:21.734 --> 00:28:23.567
Shall I call you?

336
00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:25.318
Don't worry.

337
00:28:26.193 --> 00:28:27.401
I'll call you.

338
00:28:31.318 --> 00:28:33.567
Canelo, come here!

339
00:28:35.151 --> 00:28:36.151
Hello.

340
00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:40.984
Come up here.

341
00:28:41.318 --> 00:28:42.318
How's it going?

342
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.360
Don't wake up.

343
00:29:33.734 --> 00:29:35.485
I got your letter and I came.

344
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:40.818
I never imagined that your wife...

345
00:29:42.984 --> 00:29:44.485
Don't think about that now.

346
00:30:14.818 --> 00:30:16.151
Good morning.

347
00:30:17.984 --> 00:30:21.026
- These cookies are so good!
- They're typical of here.


348
00:30:22.276 --> 00:30:23.859
I was fixing breakfast.

349
00:30:25.026 --> 00:30:26.485
I was really hungry.

350
00:30:26.609 --> 00:30:27.651
Anything for me?

351
00:30:28.485 --> 00:30:29.776
We'll find something...

352
00:30:37.527 --> 00:30:41.318
I took your letter as an invitation
to come and see you.


353
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:42.984
That was my intention.

354
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:48.276
I never thought that your wife had died.
I'm sorry.


355
00:30:48.485 --> 00:30:51.485
It was for the best. 
She had no life.

356
00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.984
Marian told me you were here,
waiting for the bus,


357
00:30:56.776 --> 00:30:58.485
but that she wasn't certain you'd leave.

358
00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:02.318
She told me you were with a woman.

359
00:31:03.151 --> 00:31:04.485
Ava, I think.

360
00:31:05.984 --> 00:31:08.485
She's an old friend, you'll meet her.

361
00:31:09.318 --> 00:31:10.609
She's an artist like you.

362
00:31:11.485 --> 00:31:12.818
I'm not an artist.

363
00:31:13.651 --> 00:31:15.651
I teach Classical Literature.

364
00:31:15.818 --> 00:31:17.151
And now, not even that.

365
00:31:17.485 --> 00:31:19.527
Well, I'm sure you'll like her.

366
00:31:21.026 --> 00:31:22.651
I think I'll leave today.

367
00:31:25.485 --> 00:31:27.318
I don't know what I'm doing here.

368
00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:28.651
Fishing.

369
00:31:28.984 --> 00:31:32.151
It's going to be a lovely day.
We'll go fishing.


370
00:31:33.026 --> 00:31:35.527
Marian... Julieta.

371
00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:37.151
I think you've met already.

372
00:31:37.318 --> 00:31:39.360
Give me that, I'll do it.

373
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.609
Are you staying today?

374
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:47.276
Yes.

375
00:31:47.693 --> 00:31:48.859
We're going fishing.

376
00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:05.151
<i>I had no job,</i>

377
00:32:05.818 --> 00:32:07.651
<i>I wasn't in a hurry.</i>

378
00:32:07.985 --> 00:32:10.276
<i>I was intending to
stay just a few days.</i>

379
00:32:11.276 --> 00:32:15.485
<i>I had to tell Xoan something,
but I kept putting it off.</i>


380
00:32:16.276 --> 00:32:17.859
<i>It was a new life,</i>

381
00:32:18.485 --> 00:32:21.026
<i>strange for a woman
who came from the sun</i>


382
00:32:21.527 --> 00:32:23.151
<i>but welcoming.</i>

383
00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:26.651
<i>The nights flew past
for me in Xoan's arms.</i>


384
00:32:27.985 --> 00:32:29.859
<i>I felt trapped</i>

385
00:32:30.318 --> 00:32:31.985
<i>and free at the same time.</i>

386
00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:35.151
May I touch it?

387
00:32:35.318 --> 00:32:37.151
Of course, pick it up, if you like.

388
00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:41.026
It's so heavy!

389
00:32:41.151 --> 00:32:43.443
Nine pounds, so be careful.

390
00:32:43.818 --> 00:32:45.026
I thought it was terracotta.

391
00:32:45.151 --> 00:32:48.651
It's bronze.
But I give them a terracotta glaze.


392
00:32:48.985 --> 00:32:50.818
The color of the
rocks at the lighthouse.


393
00:32:52.776 --> 00:32:54.651
It's got such force!

394
00:32:55.151 --> 00:32:59.485
I try to make my sculptures compact,
so the wind can't knock them over.


395
00:33:00.485 --> 00:33:01.943
Like the people here.

396
00:33:02.527 --> 00:33:03.985
The people here are very tough.

397
00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:08.609
<i>I visited Ava frequently.</i>

398
00:33:08.943 --> 00:33:10.818
<i>I liked to see her working</i>

399
00:33:11.277 --> 00:33:12.693
<i>and smoking.</i>

400
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:16.485
<i>And she liked me
telling her mythological stories,</i>


401
00:33:17.277 --> 00:33:19.318
<i>like you when you were little.</i>

402
00:33:20.776 --> 00:33:23.651
The gods created men and other beings,

403
00:33:24.026 --> 00:33:25.776
with the help of clay and fire.

404
00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:31.818
They gave them the attributes
they needed for their survival.


405
00:33:32.527 --> 00:33:36.818
Some got fur,
others got wings for flying.


406
00:33:37.776 --> 00:33:39.651
When it was man's turn,

407
00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:43.151
the gods had no gifts left.

408
00:33:44.151 --> 00:33:45.693
So man was born

409
00:33:46.026 --> 00:33:49.609
naked, defenseless,
in the midst of nature.


410
00:33:53.026 --> 00:33:54.776
I'm pregnant, Ava.

411
00:33:56.151 --> 00:33:57.318
By whom?

412
00:33:58.277 --> 00:33:59.360
By Xoan.

413
00:34:00.693 --> 00:34:02.318
I was pregnant when I came here.

414
00:34:03.693 --> 00:34:04.776
Does he know?

415
00:34:06.818 --> 00:34:07.818
No.

416
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.025
I don't want to pressure him.

417
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:13.985
You have to tell him.
Xoan adores children.


418
00:34:17.277 --> 00:34:20.360
<i>When you were born,
I took you to your grandparents,</i>


419
00:34:20.609 --> 00:34:23.277
<i>so they could meet you and Xoan.</i>

420
00:34:24.151 --> 00:34:26.776
<i>Two years later we visited them again.</i>

421
00:34:26.985 --> 00:34:29.276
<i>Grandpa Samuel had
taken early retirement.</i>


422
00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:33.318
<i>He had been the town's schoolmaster
and he gave it up to be a farmer.</i>


423
00:34:34.318 --> 00:34:38.692
<i>He'd sold the house where I'd grown up
and bought another in the country.</i>


424
00:34:40.818 --> 00:34:42.484
There they are.

425
00:35:05.485 --> 00:35:08.485
- Do you need anything else?
- No, thank you.


426
00:35:08.609 --> 00:35:10.318
Have a good time.

427
00:35:15.152 --> 00:35:16.485
Hello, love.

428
00:35:17.068 --> 00:35:19.568
Who have we got here?

429
00:35:20.152 --> 00:35:21.776
Will you give Grandpa a kiss?

430
00:35:23.152 --> 00:35:26.277
- How was the trip?
- Really long. We're worn out.


431
00:35:26.985 --> 00:35:28.485
Let me introduce you.

432
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:30.485
This is Sanáa.

433
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:31.818
Julieta.

434
00:35:33.068 --> 00:35:34.985
And this wonder is Antía.

435
00:35:35.152 --> 00:35:36.318
Have you got a case?

436
00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:39.776
Yes, a brown one,
it's got my name on it.


437
00:35:39.985 --> 00:35:41.485
Can you get it?

438
00:35:43.152 --> 00:35:44.568
And a stroller!

439
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:47.818
How's Mom?

440
00:35:48.152 --> 00:35:49.651
Fine, we're getting by.

441
00:35:49.818 --> 00:35:50.985
You'll see her now.

442
00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:52.985
And that girl?

443
00:35:53.277 --> 00:35:55.402
It's Sanáa, the girl I told you about.

444
00:35:55.818 --> 00:35:57.318
She's the woman who helps you?

445
00:35:57.943 --> 00:36:00.568
She looks after your mom
and helps me on the land.


446
00:36:01.152 --> 00:36:03.609
We were lucky to find her.
She's changed our lives.


447
00:36:04.402 --> 00:36:05.651
Let's get in the car.

448
00:36:06.485 --> 00:36:09.651
- Don't you miss the school?
- I don't have time.


449
00:36:09.985 --> 00:36:12.651
Between your mother and the land,
the days fly by.


450
00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:15.735
I never thought you'd retire,

451
00:36:16.485 --> 00:36:18.152
much less retire early.

452
00:36:18.277 --> 00:36:19.818
It's better for us like this.

453
00:36:20.485 --> 00:36:23.277
Your mother and I always dreamed
of living in the country.


454
00:36:27.152 --> 00:36:28.318
Do you speak Spanish, Sanáa?

455
00:36:28.985 --> 00:36:30.068
A little.

456
00:36:33.485 --> 00:36:34.901
She speaks it very well.

457
00:36:35.985 --> 00:36:37.568
She's a bit shy.

458
00:36:38.402 --> 00:36:42.068
We met her eight years ago,
at the Sacred Music Festival in Fez.


459
00:36:42.318 --> 00:36:45.402
She and your mother became friends
and we kept in touch.


460
00:36:46.985 --> 00:36:49.485
We're lucky she's living with us now.

461
00:36:51.651 --> 00:36:53.152
It's lovely.

462
00:36:53.818 --> 00:36:57.485
There are no luxuries,
but we've improved our quality of life.


463
00:36:58.485 --> 00:37:00.068
Which is Mom's room?

464
00:37:00.277 --> 00:37:02.318
The window that looks out on the vine.

465
00:37:03.651 --> 00:37:05.485
- Do you like the house?
- Yeah.


466
00:37:05.568 --> 00:37:06.735
Yeah?

467
00:37:13.152 --> 00:37:15.318
I'll show you the house later.

468
00:37:15.485 --> 00:37:16.818
I want to see Mom now.

469
00:37:17.985 --> 00:37:20.402
Maybe you'll be lucky and she's awake.

470
00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:37.568
Sara, Julieta is here.

471
00:37:40.651 --> 00:37:42.402
Yes... Our daughter.

472
00:37:45.402 --> 00:37:46.818
Our daughter.

473
00:37:50.152 --> 00:37:51.485
Hello, Mom.

474
00:37:52.985 --> 00:37:54.735
We're here.

475
00:37:57.152 --> 00:37:58.818
Aren't you glad to see us?

476
00:38:10.901 --> 00:38:12.485
This is Antía.

477
00:38:14.485 --> 00:38:17.319
You don't recognize her
because she's gotten so big.


478
00:38:19.568 --> 00:38:21.776
I've prepared the room across the hall,

479
00:38:22.068 --> 00:38:23.651
so you can be close.

480
00:38:24.651 --> 00:38:26.610
I'd rather stay here.

481
00:38:27.735 --> 00:38:29.277
I'll sleep with Mom.

482
00:38:31.568 --> 00:38:34.277
Antía can sleep on the little bed.

483
00:38:35.485 --> 00:38:38.152
Sanáa will change the sheets on it.

484
00:38:38.485 --> 00:38:40.152
That's where she sleeps.

485
00:39:06.651 --> 00:39:08.319
Julieta!

486
00:39:18.651 --> 00:39:20.068
Mom...

487
00:39:21.818 --> 00:39:23.319
What are you doing here?

488
00:39:26.068 --> 00:39:27.735
I've come to see you.

489
00:39:29.068 --> 00:39:30.277
I've brought the baby.

490
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:33.902
Who?

491
00:39:34.068 --> 00:39:35.776
Antía,

492
00:39:36.485 --> 00:39:37.485
my daughter.

493
00:39:46.152 --> 00:39:47.402
Look at her.

494
00:39:48.985 --> 00:39:50.693
She's so big!

495
00:39:51.485 --> 00:39:53.152
She's two years old.

496
00:39:56.068 --> 00:39:57.527
Two years...

497
00:40:41.902 --> 00:40:45.277
Antía, come here.
I've got some lovely strawberries.


498
00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:48.568
Not now, Dad.
I've just put a clean dress on her.


499
00:40:50.194 --> 00:40:51.610
Have you nothing to say to Mom?

500
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.068
You look beautiful, Sara.

501
00:41:00.568 --> 00:41:03.194
- I've got all the jars.
- Good.


502
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.277
- Dad, may I speak to you?
- Of course.


503
00:41:06.486 --> 00:41:09.860
Sanáa, see to Sara and Antía.

504
00:41:10.194 --> 00:41:12.610
And don't wake Antía.

505
00:41:13.985 --> 00:41:16.402
What happens with Mom
when you go to the market?


506
00:41:17.486 --> 00:41:19.194
One of us always stays with her.

507
00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:23.360
When you picked me up,
you left her on her own,


508
00:41:24.152 --> 00:41:25.693
locked in her room.

509
00:41:26.194 --> 00:41:29.486
I don't like doing that.
It's to protect her.


510
00:41:29.777 --> 00:41:31.277
It's no life for Mom.

511
00:41:32.902 --> 00:41:35.194
We're as well as we can be.

512
00:41:35.486 --> 00:41:38.069
You know what it would cost
to put your mother in a residence?


513
00:41:38.277 --> 00:41:40.277
I thought you'd hired a woman
to look after her.


514
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.651
Sanáa looks after her.

515
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:43.860
Sanáa looks after the land and you.

516
00:41:44.651 --> 00:41:46.277
Don't go there.

517
00:41:47.152 --> 00:41:50.402
Mom needs more than someone
to wash her and make the bed.


518
00:41:51.402 --> 00:41:52.777
You have your life,

519
00:41:53.152 --> 00:41:54.985
unfortunately very far from here.

520
00:41:55.152 --> 00:41:59.152
I've tried not to bother you too much,
but we've had lots of problems.


521
00:42:00.693 --> 00:42:03.568
Believe me, now we're better than ever.

522
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:06.110
Love,

523
00:42:06.152 --> 00:42:08.568
be a bit more generous
and understanding with me.


524
00:42:23.818 --> 00:42:25.818
The Andalusians are back!

525
00:42:27.027 --> 00:42:29.027
Antía, you've got so big!

526
00:42:31.152 --> 00:42:32.693
Hello, love.

527
00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:35.194
I thought you weren't coming back!

528
00:42:35.527 --> 00:42:38.277
We're exhausted!
The journey was never-ending.


529
00:42:38.651 --> 00:42:39.943
Do you remember your dad?

530
00:42:40.152 --> 00:42:41.651
I'm exhausted.

531
00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:44.319
How's your mom?

532
00:42:44.527 --> 00:42:45.651
Awful.

533
00:42:46.027 --> 00:42:47.486
I'll tell you later.

534
00:42:49.194 --> 00:42:51.319
Come on, chubby cheeks!

535
00:42:58.361 --> 00:43:01.277
My father is having an affair
with the girl who looks after my mother.


536
00:43:02.652 --> 00:43:04.152
Does your mother realize?

537
00:43:05.652 --> 00:43:08.277
My mother's wasting away, poor thing,

538
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.818
locked in her room.

539
00:43:11.943 --> 00:43:13.277
What's that?

540
00:43:15.361 --> 00:43:16.652
A tattoo.

541
00:43:18.693 --> 00:43:20.027
AJ?

542
00:43:22.027 --> 00:43:24.361
A for Antía and J for Julieta?

543
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:25.818
Yes.

544
00:43:28.361 --> 00:43:30.568
Careful, it's still tender.

545
00:43:43.235 --> 00:43:46.152
<i>I wonder if you live
inland or on the coast,</i>


546
00:43:46.568 --> 00:43:48.818
<i>and if you still like fishing.</i>

547
00:43:49.568 --> 00:43:52.568
<i>By the age of nine, you were going out
in the boat with your father.</i>


548
00:43:53.235 --> 00:43:54.818
<i>You wanted to be a fisherman,</i>

549
00:43:55.235 --> 00:43:56.568
<i>like him.</i>

550
00:43:57.902 --> 00:44:00.568
You can't go to camp
like Cousin Itt from the Addams Family!


551
00:44:00.652 --> 00:44:01.944
I want to go like this.

552
00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:05.735
But people have to see
you've got a forehead,


553
00:44:06.568 --> 00:44:10.902
that you've got eyes,
a nose, a mouth, ears...


554
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:12.568
Mom, don't talk rubbish.

555
00:44:12.735 --> 00:44:15.486
Antía, you're going on vacation,
you'll have fun.


556
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:17.818
I don't want to go, 
I want to stay.

557
00:44:18.152 --> 00:44:20.152
You can't always do as you want.

558
00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:21.777
What's wrong with my little girl?

559
00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:24.319
Dad, I don't want to go.

560
00:44:24.486 --> 00:44:27.818
Now that I'm on vacation,
I can go fishing with you every day.


561
00:44:29.902 --> 00:44:33.402
Didn't you say you needed help,
that you were getting old?


562
00:44:33.568 --> 00:44:35.236
The fisherwoman!

563
00:44:35.319 --> 00:44:38.152
When you come back,
I'll take you on as a mariner.


564
00:44:38.818 --> 00:44:40.402
I'll hold you to that.

565
00:44:40.568 --> 00:44:43.319
Come on, you old sea dog!

566
00:44:44.818 --> 00:44:46.152
Have fun.

567
00:44:51.319 --> 00:44:52.944
Are you leaving now?

568
00:44:55.818 --> 00:44:58.568
Will you come and visit me
when you get back?


569
00:44:58.735 --> 00:44:59.777
Won't you be here?

570
00:44:59.818 --> 00:45:03.069
No, I won't,
but promise you'll come and see me.


571
00:45:03.152 --> 00:45:04.152
Come on...

572
00:45:04.236 --> 00:45:05.444
I promise.

573
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.236
Take good care of yourself.

574
00:45:08.985 --> 00:45:10.069
Come on!

575
00:45:19.652 --> 00:45:21.319
Why is Marian leaving?

576
00:45:22.568 --> 00:45:25.319
Her husband is ill.
She has to look after him.


577
00:45:25.486 --> 00:45:26.652
You didn't fire her?

578
00:45:26.818 --> 00:45:29.735
Don't be silly! 
Of course not!

579
00:45:30.568 --> 00:45:33.818
If you asked her to stay,
I bet she would.


580
00:45:34.818 --> 00:45:37.944
People have a right to retire.

581
00:45:57.777 --> 00:46:00.735
- Do we leave your backpack here?
- No, I keep it with me.


582
00:46:09.152 --> 00:46:11.985
- Mom, I'm sorry if I was mean.
- Don't worry.


583
00:46:12.152 --> 00:46:14.277
Antía Feijóo.

584
00:46:15.152 --> 00:46:17.236
- I love you.
- Me too, very much.


585
00:46:19.486 --> 00:46:21.486
Not so fast!

586
00:46:41.944 --> 00:46:43.944
Should I fix something for supper
before I leave?


587
00:46:44.236 --> 00:46:46.902
Don't worry. Inés will be here soon.

588
00:46:47.152 --> 00:46:49.152
If you can't find anything,
call me at home.


589
00:46:49.819 --> 00:46:50.944
Thank you.

590
00:46:52.819 --> 00:46:54.236
Well...

591
00:46:55.236 --> 00:46:56.568
I'll be going.

592
00:46:57.819 --> 00:46:59.610
Are you taking Xoan's sweatshirt?

593
00:47:00.652 --> 00:47:02.652
He gave it to me ages ago.

594
00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:05.236
I'm not taking anything that isn't mine.

595
00:47:14.152 --> 00:47:16.152
Are you serious about
teaching in a school?


596
00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:18.069
Yes.

597
00:47:19.735 --> 00:47:21.069
I think it's a mistake.

598
00:47:21.568 --> 00:47:23.610
I don't want to be just a housewife.

599
00:47:24.568 --> 00:47:27.944
I have a profession I like,
I've wanted to go back to it for ages.


600
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.735
A woman's profession is her family.

601
00:47:30.902 --> 00:47:32.610
And if you want to keep it united,

602
00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:35.152
the best thing you
can do is stay at home.


603
00:47:35.277 --> 00:47:36.319
That's my business!

604
00:47:36.568 --> 00:47:38.236
If you go, it'll
be the same old thing.

605
00:47:38.652 --> 00:47:39.735
What do you mean?

606
00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:44.319
What's the same old thing?

607
00:48:14.444 --> 00:48:15.444
Has Marian left?

608
00:48:15.694 --> 00:48:16.694
Yes.

609
00:48:17.403 --> 00:48:18.777
The new woman will be here soon.

610
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.236
I hope she's more discreet.

611
00:48:22.944 --> 00:48:23.985
Why do you say that?

612
00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:27.568
When I came here 13 years ago,
Marian told me not to wait for you.


613
00:48:28.568 --> 00:48:30.069
You were spending the night with Ava.

614
00:48:31.694 --> 00:48:34.069
Now, before she left,
she said something similar.


615
00:48:35.236 --> 00:48:38.152
When I went with Antía
to see my parents 10 years ago,


616
00:48:38.902 --> 00:48:40.652
you spent the nights with Ava again.

617
00:48:50.568 --> 00:48:52.403
Hello, I'm Inés.

618
00:48:53.777 --> 00:48:55.486
Would you mind coming tomorrow?

619
00:48:56.444 --> 00:48:57.902
Marian did everything.

620
00:48:58.777 --> 00:49:00.403
Of course, I'll come tomorrow.

621
00:49:00.568 --> 00:49:01.568
Thank you.

622
00:49:01.652 --> 00:49:03.403
See you tomorrow.

623
00:49:10.152 --> 00:49:11.819
I've known Ava forever.

624
00:49:14.111 --> 00:49:15.403
We've never been a couple,

625
00:49:15.944 --> 00:49:17.777
but we screwed from time to time.

626
00:49:20.777 --> 00:49:24.278
I wanted to tell you lots of times,
but I didn't know how to.


627
00:49:29.403 --> 00:49:32.361
I'm not much of a talker,
you've realized that.


628
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.278
But Antía and you are
the most important things in my life.


629
00:49:35.444 --> 00:49:36.486
You know that, don't you?

630
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:41.403
Aren't you going to say anything?

631
00:49:42.819 --> 00:49:43.819
No.

632
00:49:46.152 --> 00:49:47.403
What are you going to do?

633
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:50.152
Go for a walk

634
00:49:51.735 --> 00:49:53.610
and prepare my classes.

635
00:49:59.444 --> 00:50:01.194
I think I'll go fishing.

636
00:51:22.278 --> 00:51:24.610
<i>Coastal radio is
reporting a sudden change</i>


637
00:51:24.777 --> 00:51:28.444
<i>in the direction and force of winds
in the Ferrol estuary.</i>


638
00:51:28.528 --> 00:51:33.236
<i>This change is causing heavy seas
with waves from 20 to 25 feet.</i>


639
00:51:33.819 --> 00:51:39.528
<i>All fishing and sailing activity
should be suspended in this area,</i>


640
00:51:39.694 --> 00:51:44.694
<i>and it is recommended
that all vessels return to port.</i>


641
00:52:21.153 --> 00:52:22.278
Yes?

642
00:52:22.445 --> 00:52:23.445
Ava,

643
00:52:23.944 --> 00:52:25.361
sorry for calling.

644
00:52:26.153 --> 00:52:28.027
I just wanted to know
if Xoan is with you.


645
00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:30.236
Xoan? No.

646
00:52:32.278 --> 00:52:34.278
<i>Do you know where he might be?</i>

647
00:52:34.944 --> 00:52:36.236
Isn't he back yet?

648
00:52:36.986 --> 00:52:38.153
No.

649
00:52:38.236 --> 00:52:39.694
He must have gone fishing.

650
00:52:40.694 --> 00:52:42.153
I hope not.

651
00:52:42.694 --> 00:52:44.403
Look at the storm!

652
00:52:45.236 --> 00:52:46.736
Wait, there's something on the TV.

653
00:52:47.153 --> 00:52:50.652
<i>A boat has capsized
in the mouth of the Ferrol estuary.</i>


654
00:52:51.236 --> 00:52:53.236
<i>Its occupant has not yet been found</i>

655
00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:56.445
<i>and there are fears for his life
given the weather conditions.</i>


656
00:52:56.736 --> 00:52:59.445
<i>A pleasure boat with a crew of three</i>

657
00:52:59.569 --> 00:53:01.111
<i>is in the same situation.</i>

658
00:53:01.236 --> 00:53:04.278
<i>Rough seas, with waves of over 20 feet,</i>

659
00:53:04.361 --> 00:53:07.819
<i>have impeded any rescue attempt...</i>

660
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:36.403
CIVIL GUARD

661
00:53:49.278 --> 00:53:51.069
I'm Judge Vicente Louro.

662
00:53:51.236 --> 00:53:53.902
Before I can proceed,
I need you to identify the body.


663
00:54:04.777 --> 00:54:06.486
I'm sorry to put you through this.

664
00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:08.861
The storm was so violent

665
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:11.610
that the body isn't intact.

666
00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.652
I'll get it.

667
00:55:37.153 --> 00:55:38.694
It's Antía.

668
00:55:39.236 --> 00:55:40.569
Antía?

669
00:55:41.403 --> 00:55:43.652
She wants to talk
to you, from the camp.

670
00:55:44.153 --> 00:55:45.986
You have to talk to her.

671
00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:48.569
Come on.

672
00:55:52.861 --> 00:55:53.944
Antía...

673
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:55.403
Mom, it's me.

674
00:55:55.569 --> 00:55:57.111
What's wrong with your phone?

675
00:55:57.278 --> 00:55:59.403
I've called loads of times
and you don't answer.


676
00:56:01.153 --> 00:56:03.486
I mustn't have heard it.

677
00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:06.361
How are you, darling?

678
00:56:06.486 --> 00:56:07.569
<i>Great.</i>

679
00:56:08.403 --> 00:56:10.445
Ava and I will pick you up tomorrow.

680
00:56:11.153 --> 00:56:13.069
We'll get there early.

681
00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:14.736
<i>You don't have to, Mom.</i>

682
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:18.236
I'm with my friend Bea. 
I met her here

683
00:56:18.403 --> 00:56:19.903
and now we're best friends.

684
00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:24.236
<i>Can I go and spend a week
with them in Madrid?</i>


685
00:56:24.361 --> 00:56:25.861
<i>You don't mind, do you?</i>

686
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:28.652
But we don't know them.

687
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:31.069
But she's my friend...

688
00:56:31.236 --> 00:56:34.278
I'll put her mother on,
she can tell you.


689
00:56:35.153 --> 00:56:38.652
Hello, how are you?
I'm Claudia, Beatriz's mother.


690
00:56:39.236 --> 00:56:40.361
How's my daughter?

691
00:56:40.569 --> 00:56:41.986
Very well, great.

692
00:56:42.153 --> 00:56:46.069
I didn't know her before,
but camp has done wonders for her.


693
00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:49.736
I wanted to ask your permission
to take her to Madrid with us.


694
00:56:49.986 --> 00:56:53.777
They've grown really close
and are making such a fuss about it...


695
00:56:53.944 --> 00:56:56.069
Doesn't the camp end tomorrow?

696
00:56:56.361 --> 00:56:59.361
Yes, but I came a day early.

697
00:56:59.777 --> 00:57:02.611
I was hoping to take
them this afternoon.


698
00:57:02.777 --> 00:57:03.861
<i>What do you think?</i>

699
00:57:04.278 --> 00:57:05.569
Well,

700
00:57:07.903 --> 00:57:09.569
if she'd like that...

701
00:57:30.736 --> 00:57:32.069
Julieta, how are you?

702
00:57:32.236 --> 00:57:33.403
I'm Claudia.

703
00:57:33.694 --> 00:57:35.153
Come in, please.

704
00:57:35.487 --> 00:57:37.569
I'm so sorry, really.

705
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:41.403
How was the journey?

706
00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:43.069
Come in.

707
00:57:45.736 --> 00:57:48.986
The girls are playing.
I didn't say anything to them.


708
00:57:49.819 --> 00:57:52.236
Does Antía think it odd
that I've come for her today?


709
00:57:52.403 --> 00:57:54.903
She's angry because she thinks
you've come to take her away.


710
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:59.236
She called Xoan,
but he didn't answer, obviously.


711
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:01.069
Where shall I tell her?

712
00:58:01.236 --> 00:58:04.569
I think you'll be more
comfortable in there.


713
00:58:04.986 --> 00:58:07.487
Would you like anything?
Something to eat?


714
00:58:08.944 --> 00:58:09.986
I don't know.

715
00:58:10.944 --> 00:58:13.986
Well, go on in.

716
00:58:14.861 --> 00:58:16.236
I'll get her.

717
00:58:29.778 --> 00:58:30.819
Hi, Mom!

718
00:58:31.944 --> 00:58:33.236
Hello, love.

719
00:58:33.361 --> 00:58:34.652
How are you?

720
00:58:38.361 --> 00:58:39.611
Sit down.

721
00:58:42.153 --> 00:58:44.278
I told you to let me
stay a few more days.


722
00:58:45.819 --> 00:58:48.487
Don't look like that, we're on vacation.

723
00:58:48.861 --> 00:58:50.070
How's Dad?

724
00:58:50.236 --> 00:58:52.403
He's got such a nerve! 
He's ignoring me!

725
00:58:53.861 --> 00:58:55.569
I have to tell you something.

726
00:58:56.362 --> 00:58:57.362
Go on.

727
00:58:59.362 --> 00:59:01.611
Two days after you left,
there was a storm.


728
00:59:02.694 --> 00:59:07.153
The boat Dad was in
and two other boats disappeared.


729
00:59:08.153 --> 00:59:09.445
No one was saved.

730
00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.445
And Dad?

731
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:14.278
He wasn't saved either.

732
00:59:15.278 --> 00:59:18.861
- He's dead?
- Yes.


733
00:59:27.236 --> 00:59:28.694
Antía...

734
00:59:41.362 --> 00:59:43.778
Why did he go fishing
if there was a storm?


735
00:59:45.569 --> 00:59:47.736
The storm broke in the afternoon.

736
00:59:48.736 --> 00:59:50.445
Your dad went out in the morning.

737
00:59:54.236 --> 00:59:55.986
I'm sorry to bring this up now.

738
00:59:56.153 --> 01:00:01.236
We'd planned a trip to Patagonia
and now Bea doesn't want to come.


739
01:00:01.362 --> 01:00:03.986
She wants to stay here with Antía.

740
01:00:04.569 --> 01:00:07.236
- Obviously, they can't stay on their own.
- Of course not.


741
01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.445
I thought that maybe
you could stay here with them.


742
01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:11.070
My son is coming with us.

743
01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:12.153
Here?

744
01:00:12.236 --> 01:00:13.445
The two girls and you.

745
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:16.362
After what's happened,
the rest will do you good.


746
01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:18.653
And Antía will be more
distracted in Madrid.


747
01:00:18.819 --> 01:00:19.819
Well...

748
01:00:19.986 --> 01:00:21.778
Rosa will take care of everything.

749
01:00:22.236 --> 01:00:26.070
You can go out for a walk,
go to the cinema, rest...


750
01:00:26.403 --> 01:00:27.819
I haven't brought any clothes.

751
01:00:27.986 --> 01:00:29.569
You can use mine.

752
01:00:29.736 --> 01:00:30.736
I've got everything.

753
01:00:30.819 --> 01:00:31.861
Raincoats,

754
01:00:31.945 --> 01:00:34.861
blouses that are tight on me now
and will look much better on you...


755
01:00:34.945 --> 01:00:36.569
You can try on whatever you like.

756
01:01:22.986 --> 01:01:25.694
<i>Things happened
without my participation,</i>


757
01:01:26.653 --> 01:01:28.945
<i>one thing foretelling the next.</i>

758
01:01:51.487 --> 01:01:52.861
Good morning.

759
01:01:53.028 --> 01:01:55.320
We've come to see
the apartment that's for rent.


760
01:01:55.487 --> 01:01:57.320
Yes, just a minute.

761
01:01:59.611 --> 01:02:00.653
This way.

762
01:02:11.653 --> 01:02:12.945
The kitchen.

763
01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:21.694
- The wallpaper is a bit oppressive.
- No, it's cool.


764
01:02:22.153 --> 01:02:24.028
If we get bored, we'll paint it.

765
01:02:25.445 --> 01:02:28.487
- We'll take it.
- And we'll be neighbors.


766
01:02:28.653 --> 01:02:31.945
<i>Bea and you found an apartment
close to where she lived.</i>


767
01:02:33.487 --> 01:02:35.362
<i>You made me rent it.</i>

768
01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:38.320
<i>By then I was worn out,</i>

769
01:02:39.611 --> 01:02:42.028
<i>but you were as strong as an ox.</i>

770
01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.653
<i>You had suddenly grown up.</i>

771
01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.153
<i>You went back home with Ava,</i>

772
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.028
<i>to close it and
put it up for sale.</i>

773
01:02:56.986 --> 01:02:59.153
<i>In Madrid, Bea looked after me.</i>

774
01:03:00.153 --> 01:03:02.611
<i>I wouldn't have
survived without you two.</i>


775
01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:07.487
<i>When you came back,
we didn't talk much about the trip.</i>


776
01:03:08.112 --> 01:03:09.820
<i>You didn't want to make me sad,</i>

777
01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:13.320
<i>and I didn't have the strength to ask.</i>

778
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.487
Come on, Mom.
We're going to stand you up.


779
01:03:18.653 --> 01:03:20.362
Bea, give me a hand.

780
01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:22.820
That's good.

781
01:03:22.986 --> 01:03:24.611
Be careful you don't slip.

782
01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.320
Put the towel around her.

783
01:03:29.653 --> 01:03:31.611
Pass me that big towel.

784
01:03:32.487 --> 01:03:34.820
- This one?
- Yes, that's it.


785
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.445
Put it over her back.

786
01:03:39.153 --> 01:03:42.153
This foot.

787
01:03:42.362 --> 01:03:43.487
Now the other.

788
01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:44.986
Careful.

789
01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.653
Rub her back well, that'll warm her up.

790
01:03:51.986 --> 01:03:53.694
I don't want her to catch cold.

791
01:04:11.653 --> 01:04:14.611
Now I'll finish it off with the dryer.

792
01:04:21.653 --> 01:04:22.820
Hi, Mom.

793
01:04:22.986 --> 01:04:24.278
Hello.

794
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.487
If we're going to eat something,
hurry up.


795
01:04:27.653 --> 01:04:29.820
I'm meeting Bea to study.

796
01:04:29.945 --> 01:04:32.653
- Do you like how it's turning out?
- Yes.


797
01:04:33.153 --> 01:04:35.153
I think I'll do the
sitting room tomorrow.


798
01:04:35.362 --> 01:04:38.820
Don't bother,
I've got used to the wallpaper


799
01:04:39.278 --> 01:04:40.611
and Bea loves it.

800
01:04:40.695 --> 01:04:43.820
Bea has a beautiful,
vanilla-colored house,


801
01:04:44.028 --> 01:04:45.820
and she doesn't have to live here.

802
01:04:46.112 --> 01:04:47.611
Shall I fix you a sandwich?

803
01:04:48.112 --> 01:04:50.362
Okay, but hurry.

804
01:04:50.611 --> 01:04:52.211
<i>I got over the depression with your help</i>

805
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.112
<i>and I found a job
I could do at home,</i>

806
01:04:55.653 --> 01:04:57.820
<i>proofreading.</i>

807
01:04:58.487 --> 01:05:00.695
<i>I dedicated the rest
of my time to you.</i>

808
01:05:01.445 --> 01:05:02.820
<i>I didn't need anything else.</i>

809
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:10.195
<i>Four years later,
when Bea went to the U.S.,</i>


810
01:05:10.487 --> 01:05:13.278
<i>you chose a spiritual
retreat in the Pyrenees.</i>


811
01:05:14.028 --> 01:05:16.362
<i>A retreat that would last three months,</i>

812
01:05:17.195 --> 01:05:19.861
<i>until you came back to go to university.</i>

813
01:05:21.445 --> 01:05:23.362
<i>I was horrified at being
separated from you</i>


814
01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:26.278
<i>but you had gone out very little
in those last years.</i>


815
01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.611
<i>You were always busy
with me and your studies.</i>


816
01:05:30.487 --> 01:05:33.945
<i>I had no right to say no. 
And, besides,</i>

817
01:05:34.611 --> 01:05:36.320
<i>you were of age by then.</i>

818
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.445
Yes?

819
01:05:39.153 --> 01:05:40.153
Yes, that's me.

820
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.487
I'll be down now.

821
01:05:45.987 --> 01:05:48.112
That's my taxi, it's downstairs.

822
01:05:52.153 --> 01:05:54.320
- Are you taking the fishnet?
- Yes.


823
01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.987
Leave it, Mom, I can do it.

824
01:06:04.153 --> 01:06:05.362
Well,

825
01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.112
take care of yourself and have fun.

826
01:06:09.153 --> 01:06:11.112
You take care, too.

827
01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.820
And don't worry
if I don't call or write very much.


828
01:06:15.987 --> 01:06:17.820
Will you be incommunicado?

829
01:06:18.487 --> 01:06:21.320
It's a retreat.
The important thing is to disconnect.


830
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:22.987
What if I get sick?

831
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.153
Don't try to blackmail me!

832
01:06:25.653 --> 01:06:27.153
Of course not.

833
01:06:27.487 --> 01:06:30.362
I've got my work,
and I want to sort out my notes.


834
01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.487
Maybe I'll turn them into a book.

835
01:06:33.153 --> 01:06:34.611
I'll be busy.

836
01:06:35.028 --> 01:06:36.445
That's great.

837
01:06:40.653 --> 01:06:43.028
Let me go with you to the station.

838
01:06:44.153 --> 01:06:46.279
Remember you don't like farewells.

839
01:06:50.653 --> 01:06:51.987
Well,

840
01:06:53.445 --> 01:06:54.611
goodbye.

841
01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:51.362
Europe

842
01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.362
Hello.

843
01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:09.986
I'm Antía Feijóo's mother.
I'm picking her up today.


844
01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:11.819
This way.

845
01:08:21.487 --> 01:08:22.652
- Julieta Arcos?
- Yes.


846
01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.112
- I'm Antía's mother.
- I'm Juana.


847
01:08:27.154 --> 01:08:29.487
What a magnificent place!

848
01:08:29.653 --> 01:08:32.820
I've asked Liliana
to serve us some tea out here.


849
01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.987
Does Antía know I'm here?

850
01:08:38.487 --> 01:08:39.529
Yes.

851
01:08:39.611 --> 01:08:40.695
I can't wait to see her.

852
01:08:41.610 --> 01:08:44.153
These three months without her
have been so long...


853
01:08:44.195 --> 01:08:45.237
Of course.

854
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.154
I realize you have your reasons,

855
01:08:47.611 --> 01:08:50.820
but the lack of communication
all this time has been very difficult.


856
01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.820
Will I have to wait very long?

857
01:09:02.362 --> 01:09:04.279
Antía isn't here.

858
01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.320
Isn't this the house?
I followed the directions...


859
01:09:08.486 --> 01:09:09.862
Yes, this is the house.

860
01:09:10.028 --> 01:09:12.446
When Antía wrote to you,
she thought she'd be here.


861
01:09:12.611 --> 01:09:14.319
But, in the end, she decided to leave.

862
01:09:14.487 --> 01:09:17.279
She could have told me.
I've driven from Madrid.


863
01:09:17.446 --> 01:09:18.487
I know.

864
01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.320
Where did she go?

865
01:09:21.653 --> 01:09:22.694
I hope it's near here.

866
01:09:23.446 --> 01:09:24.695
I can't tell you.

867
01:09:25.487 --> 01:09:26.487
What?

868
01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:28.862
I can't tell you where she is.

869
01:09:29.028 --> 01:09:30.028
I'm sorry.

870
01:09:30.486 --> 01:09:33.987
Don't you know?
You're the one in charge here.


871
01:09:34.154 --> 01:09:36.653
Of course I know,
but Antía asked me not to tell you.


872
01:09:36.987 --> 01:09:39.486
Are you insinuating
my daughter doesn't want to see me?


873
01:09:41.362 --> 01:09:42.652
Let's see...

874
01:09:44.695 --> 01:09:48.987
Antía has chosen her own path,
and you're not part of it.


875
01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:52.446
I understand that it must be
very painful for you,


876
01:09:52.611 --> 01:09:54.653
but she begs you to accept it.

877
01:09:56.487 --> 01:09:58.279
I think I'm going to call the police.

878
01:10:00.987 --> 01:10:02.320
Do as you wish,

879
01:10:03.362 --> 01:10:05.695
but I think you should
start to face reality.


880
01:10:06.154 --> 01:10:07.653
I understand that it isn't easy.

881
01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.487
What did you do to my daughter
in these three months?


882
01:10:10.653 --> 01:10:12.154
We helped her.

883
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.862
Your daughter arrived
in a state of extreme need.


884
01:10:15.279 --> 01:10:18.487
Need of what?
She's always had all that she needed!


885
01:10:19.195 --> 01:10:22.611
Yet she felt alone, and very unhappy.

886
01:10:24.279 --> 01:10:27.987
She has realized that her life
was lacking a spiritual dimension.


887
01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.945
What do you mean?

888
01:10:31.446 --> 01:10:34.029
I believe she didn't grow up
in a home based on faith.


889
01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.820
She found it here.

890
01:10:37.362 --> 01:10:38.862
Let her tell me that!

891
01:10:39.446 --> 01:10:40.653
Where is she?

892
01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:42.987
I can't tell you.

893
01:10:43.987 --> 01:10:47.154
What matters is that Antía
is better than ever and very happy.


894
01:10:47.321 --> 01:10:49.820
If you stop thinking about yourself
and think about her,


895
01:10:49.987 --> 01:10:50.987
you should be happy.

896
01:10:52.487 --> 01:10:54.154
You can't tell me that.

897
01:10:54.487 --> 01:10:55.820
Don't despair.

898
01:10:56.611 --> 01:10:58.820
Perhaps she'll decide to contact you,

899
01:10:59.778 --> 01:11:01.404
but give her time.

900
01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.820
<i>I reported your
disappearance to the police,</i>


901
01:11:10.987 --> 01:11:12.862
<i>I hired a private detective.</i>

902
01:11:13.487 --> 01:11:14.611
<i>During the first months</i>

903
01:11:14.695 --> 01:11:17.611
<i>all I did was look for you
in every possible way.</i>


904
01:11:19.029 --> 01:11:21.653
<i>All I discovered was
how little I knew of you.</i>


905
01:11:37.695 --> 01:11:39.446
- Julieta Arcos?
- Yes, that's me.


906
01:11:39.612 --> 01:11:40.820
I have a letter for you.

907
01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.321
Will you sign here, please?

908
01:11:47.945 --> 01:11:49.029
Thank you.

909
01:11:53.487 --> 01:11:54.820
Antía!

910
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:23.154
Hello, Dad.

911
01:12:23.195 --> 01:12:24.321
Hello, Julieta.

912
01:12:24.653 --> 01:12:26.112
Did you see the photo I sent you?

913
01:12:26.945 --> 01:12:28.154
Yes, I'm looking at it now.

914
01:12:28.362 --> 01:12:29.612
Isn't your brother handsome?

915
01:12:30.154 --> 01:12:31.279
<i>Yes,</i>

916
01:12:31.653 --> 01:12:32.653
he certainly is.

917
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.279
When will you come and meet him?

918
01:12:35.112 --> 01:12:37.945
I can't now, Dad.
I told you I'm very busy.


919
01:12:38.653 --> 01:12:40.362
I'm sorry, I have to hang up.

920
01:12:41.112 --> 01:12:42.279
I'll call you.

921
01:12:42.612 --> 01:12:44.112
<i>Stop punishing me.</i>

922
01:12:44.279 --> 01:12:46.695
Haven't I the right to be happy
after your mother's death?


923
01:12:46.987 --> 01:12:48.653
I'd rather not talk about Mom's death.

924
01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:51.612
Remember you're still my daughter
and Antía is my granddaughter.


925
01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.487
<i>The last time I saw
her she was just a child.</i>


926
01:12:55.446 --> 01:12:57.487
Give her a kiss from me.

927
01:12:57.653 --> 01:12:59.029
I'll do that.

928
01:12:59.987 --> 01:13:01.820
Kisses to all of you, too.

929
01:13:18.529 --> 01:13:22.695
<i>The first three years,
I bought you a cake on your birthday.</i>


930
01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:27.820
<i>I was consoled by the idea
of celebrating a postcard from you</i>


931
01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.653
<i>and at least seeing your handwriting
on the address.</i>


932
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:33.279
<i>I didn't expect more,</i>

933
01:13:33.695 --> 01:13:35.653
<i>but even that was expecting too much.</i>

934
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.029
<i>The first three years,</i>

935
01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:42.695
<i>throwing a cake in the garbage
to celebrate your birthday</i>


936
01:13:43.446 --> 01:13:45.488
<i>became a tradition.</i>

937
01:14:32.488 --> 01:14:33.987
Inocencio,

938
01:14:34.321 --> 01:14:36.404
I'm giving up the apartment,
I'm leaving Spain.


939
01:14:36.987 --> 01:14:38.488
When?

940
01:14:38.653 --> 01:14:40.987
As soon as possible, within a week.

941
01:14:43.321 --> 01:14:44.488
Inocencio,

942
01:14:44.987 --> 01:14:46.695
I apologize for the
commotion last night.


943
01:14:46.904 --> 01:14:48.404
The tenant below you complained.

944
01:14:49.112 --> 01:14:50.820
I won't be bothering him anymore.

945
01:14:51.446 --> 01:14:52.737
Goodbye.

946
01:14:59.196 --> 01:15:01.820
<i>I looked for an area of Madrid
where you'd never been.</i>


947
01:15:02.446 --> 01:15:05.196
<i>I wanted a place
where there was no trace of you,</i>


948
01:15:05.362 --> 01:15:07.196
<i>where nothing reminded me of you.</i>

949
01:15:46.112 --> 01:15:47.196
Hello.

950
01:15:48.612 --> 01:15:50.237
No, don't get up.

951
01:15:50.404 --> 01:15:52.529
Yes, I will.

952
01:15:52.695 --> 01:15:53.987
How are you?

953
01:15:54.321 --> 01:15:55.321
Well...

954
01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:00.488
The last attack
immobilized all of my left side.


955
01:16:01.737 --> 01:16:03.488
How do you like your new house?

956
01:16:04.112 --> 01:16:05.321
It's better.

957
01:16:06.612 --> 01:16:08.529
It's like living in another city.

958
01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:11.653
They're beautiful.

959
01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:15.267
I've got a present for you, too.

960
01:16:16.112 --> 01:16:17.446
It's in the bag.

961
01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:25.029
<i>The Seated Man!</i>

962
01:16:30.446 --> 01:16:31.820
Thank you so much, Ava.

963
01:16:34.695 --> 01:16:37.529
Before you leave,
I'd like to tell you something.


964
01:16:38.862 --> 01:16:41.196
- It doesn't explain anything...
- It isn't necessary.


965
01:16:41.862 --> 01:16:44.488
Everything has been clear
between us for a long time.


966
01:16:45.196 --> 01:16:46.279
It's about Antía.

967
01:16:52.196 --> 01:16:56.071
When we went to close up your house,

968
01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:57.279
Marian came.

969
01:17:04.862 --> 01:17:06.321
Antía!

970
01:17:08.737 --> 01:17:12.071
<i>I couldn't prevent her seeing Antía
and talking to her.</i>


971
01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:16.071
She told her everything
about Xoan's last day.


972
01:17:17.071 --> 01:17:18.904
Your row

973
01:17:19.612 --> 01:17:23.612
and that Xoan put out to sea
even though it was choppy that day.


974
01:17:23.737 --> 01:17:25.529
But Marian wasn't there.

975
01:17:25.904 --> 01:17:27.820
She went home before.

976
01:17:28.695 --> 01:17:32.196
Apparently Xoan rang her
to ask what you'd talked about.


977
01:17:33.654 --> 01:17:35.779
Antía never said anything,

978
01:17:36.779 --> 01:17:38.779
she never asked me anything.

979
01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:40.862
She asked me.

980
01:17:42.029 --> 01:17:45.779
She wanted to confirm
if you'd argued because of me


981
01:17:46.363 --> 01:17:48.654
and if the sea really was choppy.

982
01:17:49.196 --> 01:17:51.321
I had no idea about
the state of the sea.


983
01:17:52.238 --> 01:17:54.737
And I said I wouldn't discuss
the rest with a child.


984
01:17:55.654 --> 01:17:57.154
She was furious.

985
01:17:57.654 --> 01:17:59.987
She called me a whore.

986
01:18:01.488 --> 01:18:05.196
She blamed you and me
for Xoan going fishing.


987
01:18:07.154 --> 01:18:08.987
I don't understand.

988
01:18:10.529 --> 01:18:12.654
She never reproached me.

989
01:18:17.154 --> 01:18:19.987
We didn't talk much, that's true.

990
01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:25.029
But teenagers are mysterious,

991
01:18:26.737 --> 01:18:28.488
and I didn't want to burden her.

992
01:18:30.862 --> 01:18:31.987
Please...

993
01:18:39.363 --> 01:18:42.987
The day she left, 
Antía rang me.

994
01:18:43.154 --> 01:18:44.862
Ava, how are you?

995
01:18:45.029 --> 01:18:46.196
<i>Antía...</i>

996
01:18:46.363 --> 01:18:48.154
<i>Messed up.</i>

997
01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:51.737
<i>I got the diagnosis. 
Multiple sclerosis.</i>

998
01:18:51.862 --> 01:18:54.279
<i>But don't tell your mother.
I'll call her.</i>


999
01:18:54.321 --> 01:18:55.570
Ava,

1000
01:18:55.654 --> 01:18:59.654
I'd like to talk to you,
but this may not be the time.


1001
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:02.654
She asked me the same questions.

1002
01:19:03.654 --> 01:19:05.488
Only one thing had changed.

1003
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:08.238
The guilt had spread
to the three of us.

1004
01:19:09.488 --> 01:19:10.987
She included herself.

1005
01:19:11.987 --> 01:19:13.363
Why did she feel guilty?

1006
01:19:14.321 --> 01:19:17.363
She'd gone away
and had been happy at the camp.


1007
01:19:20.488 --> 01:19:23.154
I told her none of us
was to blame for what happened.


1008
01:19:24.821 --> 01:19:29.279
Even if we were guilty,
we'd suffered enough punishment.


1009
01:19:31.279 --> 01:19:32.987
Then Antía said:

1010
01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:36.987
"We all get what we deserve."

1011
01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:46.862
<i>I raised you in the same freedom
in which my parents had raised me.</i>


1012
01:19:48.154 --> 01:19:50.987
<i>When we moved to Madrid
and I fell into that depression,</i>


1013
01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:52.779
<i>I never told you,</i>

1014
01:19:52.862 --> 01:19:55.654
<i>but I was suffocated
by a tremendous sense of guilt</i>


1015
01:19:55.779 --> 01:19:58.154
<i>about your father's death
and that of the man on the train.</i>


1016
01:19:59.154 --> 01:20:01.029
<i>I never talked to you about it.</i>

1017
01:20:01.779 --> 01:20:03.654
<i>I wanted you to
grow up free from guilt.</i>

1018
01:20:05.029 --> 01:20:06.779
<i>But you sensed it.</i>

1019
01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:12.530
<i>And despite my silence,
I infected you like a virus.</i>


1020
01:20:23.029 --> 01:20:24.654
She asked to be sedated.

1021
01:20:26.654 --> 01:20:29.029
It was very tough...

1022
01:20:29.196 --> 01:20:31.154
Excuse me, I'm Lorenzo Gentile.

1023
01:20:33.779 --> 01:20:35.821
I saw you in the
elevator at the hospital.


1024
01:20:40.279 --> 01:20:43.488
I thought to myself,
that woman is so pretty


1025
01:20:43.654 --> 01:20:46.113
and so downhearted.

1026
01:20:46.654 --> 01:20:49.530
She must be visiting
someone who is very ill.


1027
01:20:49.862 --> 01:20:51.654
I never thought it was our beloved Ava.

1028
01:20:56.279 --> 01:20:58.113
To Ava.

1029
01:21:05.821 --> 01:21:07.154
Ava told me about you.

1030
01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:08.530
And what did she say?

1031
01:21:09.821 --> 01:21:11.488
"I have a friend you must meet."

1032
01:21:13.654 --> 01:21:15.987
<i>Ava bequeathed me Lorenzo.</i>

1033
01:21:16.862 --> 01:21:18.321
<i>I never told him about you.</i>

1034
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:21.321
<i>There wasn't a single trace of you
in the house.</i>


1035
01:21:21.779 --> 01:21:23.154
<i>You didn't exist.</i>

1036
01:21:24.488 --> 01:21:26.654
<i>I started a new life with him.</i>

1037
01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:31.654
<i>Days became weeks.
The weeks, months and years.</i>


1038
01:21:32.779 --> 01:21:34.821
<i>There were days I
didn't think about you.</i>


1039
01:21:42.821 --> 01:21:45.530
<i>When a former addict relapses just once,</i>

1040
01:21:45.654 --> 01:21:48.154
<i>no matter how many years he is clean,</i>

1041
01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:49.988
<i>the relapse is fatal.</i>

1042
01:21:51.654 --> 01:21:54.113
<i>I abstained from you for years,</i>

1043
01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:58.154
<i>but I made the mistake of relapsing
into the hope of finding you</i>


1044
01:21:58.321 --> 01:21:59.363
<i>or hearing about you.</i>

1045
01:22:01.488 --> 01:22:03.113
<i>That absurd hope</i>

1046
01:22:03.279 --> 01:22:07.029
<i>shattered the fragile base
on which I'd built my new life.</i>


1047
01:22:09.154 --> 01:22:10.779
<i>I have nothing left.</i>

1048
01:22:12.029 --> 01:22:14.154
<i>Only you exist.</i>

1049
01:22:15.154 --> 01:22:18.488
<i>Your absence fills my entire life
and destroys it.</i>


1050
01:23:27.071 --> 01:23:28.154
Julieta!

1051
01:23:32.654 --> 01:23:34.238
It's me, Bea!

1052
01:23:36.405 --> 01:23:37.821
Beatriz?

1053
01:23:38.654 --> 01:23:40.154
Is it really you?

1054
01:23:40.571 --> 01:23:41.821
Of course.

1055
01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:44.154
Are you all right?

1056
01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:47.904
Come on...

1057
01:23:48.238 --> 01:23:49.988
You were so well when I saw you.

1058
01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.321
Those two girls reminded me
of you and Antía.


1059
01:23:56.821 --> 01:23:58.154
They're my nieces.

1060
01:23:58.988 --> 01:24:00.405
But what's happened?

1061
01:24:01.654 --> 01:24:03.779
The last time you were so well...

1062
01:24:09.405 --> 01:24:11.654
When we met, I didn't tell you...

1063
01:24:12.488 --> 01:24:15.654
I haven't seen Antía for 12 years.

1064
01:24:17.071 --> 01:24:18.488
Twelve years?

1065
01:24:21.571 --> 01:24:24.154
Did you really see her like you said?

1066
01:24:25.821 --> 01:24:26.988
Yes.

1067
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.488
Yes, I did.

1068
01:24:28.654 --> 01:24:30.988
But I didn't tell you
that it was very unpleasant.


1069
01:24:31.654 --> 01:24:33.071
Unpleasant?

1070
01:24:33.321 --> 01:24:34.488
Why?

1071
01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:36.988
Antía didn't want to talk to me.

1072
01:24:37.321 --> 01:24:39.155
She did all she could to avoid me.

1073
01:24:39.571 --> 01:24:43.321
She said she didn't know me,
that I'd mistaken her for someone else.


1074
01:24:44.488 --> 01:24:45.988
But I knew it was her.

1075
01:24:46.779 --> 01:24:48.988
In the end,
she had no choice but to talk to me.


1076
01:24:49.405 --> 01:24:51.155
Is it true about the children?

1077
01:24:51.779 --> 01:24:54.779
Yes, three.
She had two of them with her.


1078
01:24:55.071 --> 01:24:58.779
Why didn't she want to talk to you?
You were her best friend.


1079
01:24:59.654 --> 01:25:01.988
We were more than that.

1080
01:25:02.488 --> 01:25:05.321
After the camp we were inseparable.
Don't you remember?


1081
01:25:06.988 --> 01:25:10.321
Yes, of course.
You were always together.


1082
01:25:10.488 --> 01:25:12.654
We couldn't live without each other.

1083
01:25:13.654 --> 01:25:15.488
It's a pity it
was hell at the end.

1084
01:25:16.904 --> 01:25:18.155
Hell?

1085
01:25:19.488 --> 01:25:20.779
I see you know nothing.

1086
01:25:21.654 --> 01:25:22.779
No,

1087
01:25:22.904 --> 01:25:24.155
I don't.

1088
01:25:25.654 --> 01:25:28.821
I went to New York to study
to get away from your daughter.


1089
01:25:29.113 --> 01:25:30.488
I rang her one day.

1090
01:25:30.654 --> 01:25:33.071
She told me she was going
to a retreat in the Pyrenees.


1091
01:25:33.488 --> 01:25:35.904
I just wanted her
to leave me in peace.

1092
01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.904
Did you ever speak again?

1093
01:25:39.488 --> 01:25:41.071
She called me once,

1094
01:25:41.988 --> 01:25:43.571
but she was a different person.

1095
01:25:45.488 --> 01:25:46.654
In what way?

1096
01:25:47.654 --> 01:25:50.280
She told me
she was ashamed of our relationship


1097
01:25:50.821 --> 01:25:52.988
and didn't want anything to do with me.

1098
01:25:53.654 --> 01:25:57.155
She was a new person
who had finally found her path


1099
01:25:57.321 --> 01:25:59.488
and I wasn't part of it.

1100
01:26:01.821 --> 01:26:04.238
She was talking like a fanatic.

1101
01:26:04.821 --> 01:26:05.988
She scared me.

1102
01:26:37.321 --> 01:26:38.405
Call an ambulance!

1103
01:26:56.321 --> 01:26:57.321
Lorenzo...

1104
01:26:58.779 --> 01:26:59.779
How are you?

1105
01:27:00.321 --> 01:27:02.030
My mouth's dry.

1106
01:27:04.571 --> 01:27:05.904
Here.

1107
01:27:10.321 --> 01:27:14.196
What a coincidence that you were there
when I had the accident.


1108
01:27:16.071 --> 01:27:18.321
I came back from Portugal four days ago.

1109
01:27:19.654 --> 01:27:22.571
I went to your house
in case I might see you coming out.


1110
01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:25.030
But I moved.

1111
01:27:25.779 --> 01:27:26.863
I don't live there anymore.

1112
01:27:27.363 --> 01:27:28.363
I know.

1113
01:27:28.654 --> 01:27:30.155
How did you find out?

1114
01:27:32.071 --> 01:27:34.821
The first days,
I followed you to see what you did.


1115
01:27:35.155 --> 01:27:36.488
You followed me?

1116
01:27:38.988 --> 01:27:41.654
Anyone less distracted
would have noticed.


1117
01:27:43.488 --> 01:27:45.196
When I realized

1118
01:27:45.363 --> 01:27:47.779
that I was turning into

1119
01:27:48.071 --> 01:27:51.238
one of Patricia Highsmith's
obsessive characters,


1120
01:27:51.405 --> 01:27:53.654
hiding around corners

1121
01:27:54.863 --> 01:27:56.904
and keeping watch outside your house,

1122
01:27:58.863 --> 01:28:00.322
I stopped following you

1123
01:28:01.238 --> 01:28:03.071
and I went to Portugal to write.

1124
01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.821
I came back a few days ago.

1125
01:28:12.155 --> 01:28:14.988
I'm sorry I said goodbye
in such a terrible way.


1126
01:29:55.988 --> 01:29:57.280
Did you read them?

1127
01:29:57.488 --> 01:30:00.988
I didn't have time,
and anyway I wouldn't have dared.


1128
01:30:01.654 --> 01:30:04.071
Read them if you like
and then destroy them.

1131
01:30:42.113 --> 01:30:43.571
<i>Dear Mom,</i>

1132
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:47.363
<i>I don't know if you're still in Madrid
and living in the same house,</i>


1133
01:30:47.905 --> 01:30:50.696
<i>but I have no other address for you.</i>

1134
01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:53.405
<i>I have three children.</i>

1135
01:30:54.571 --> 01:30:55.654
<i>Xoan,</i>

1136
01:30:55.988 --> 01:30:57.489
<i>the eldest,</i>

1137
01:30:57.654 --> 01:30:59.405
<i>was only nine years old</i>

1138
01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:02.030
<i>when he drowned in a river.</i>

1139
01:31:02.405 --> 01:31:04.654
<i>And I am insane with grief.</i>

1140
01:31:06.613 --> 01:31:08.322
<i>In these moments,</i>

1141
01:31:09.155 --> 01:31:11.571
<i>the worst in my entire life,</i>

1142
01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.654
<i>I'm thinking of you.</i>

1143
01:31:15.071 --> 01:31:18.571
<i>Now I understand what you must
have suffered when I disappeared.</i>


1144
01:31:19.863 --> 01:31:21.696
<i>I couldn't imagine it.</i>

1145
01:31:22.489 --> 01:31:25.821
<i>No one who hasn't
suffered it can imagine it.</i>


1146
01:31:28.363 --> 01:31:30.654
I'm not going to ask
her for an explanation.


1147
01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:35.238
I just want to be with her.

1148
01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:39.072
But she didn't invite me to come...

1149
01:31:40.405 --> 01:31:42.405
After 13 years she didn't dare,

1150
01:31:42.654 --> 01:31:44.780
but she put her return address.
