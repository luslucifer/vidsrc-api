1
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.049
<i>It has been nine full moons.</i>

2
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.007
<i>We have hunted it to the north
and along the eastern border.</i>


3
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.970
<i>Eight of the king's most honorable men
have given their lives during this quest.</i>


4
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.768
<i>Their bodies so mangled,
they'll barely be accepted to the heavens.</i>


5
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.489
<i>It's coming.
I feel the thunder of its wings.</i>


6
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.604
<i>The air grows hotter.</i>

7
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.280
<i>We cannot take another loss.</i>

8
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.567
<i>Now is the time to end this.</i>

9
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.684
Steel yourselves, men.
Stay in formation.


10
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.280
Where is it?

11
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.202
- It's playing games with us.
- Steady yourself, Richard.


12
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.564
This infernal beast's demise
has eluded us for too long.


13
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.323
I am ready for you.

14
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.841
Stay in rank.

15
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.645
I will even the score.

16
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.611
Enough, James.

17
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.244
Here it comes.

18
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.528
Forward.

19
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.160
- With your permission, sir, I will lead.
- Wait for it.


20
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.049
You have a death wish, Thomas.

21
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.725
Not yet. Wait until
it exposes its weak spot.

22
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.771
Now!

23
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.241
Defensive positions.

24
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.448
- It knows what we're trying to do.
- Hold it together, James.


25
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.761
Draw it in.

26
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.641
- I will make a strike.
- Back in rank. That's an order.


27
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.841
Fall back.

28
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.124
That was a foolish move.
He knew better than that.


29
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.649
It's heading back to the west.

30
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.526
And so should we.

31
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.043
Do you think the dragon
will return to the kingdom?


32
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.960
We chased it from one side
of our land to the next.


33
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.725
It has ravaged our
numbers down to just us.

34
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.491
How can just three knights slay that beast?
And what of the kingdom?


35
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.920
The king's army will protect the kingdom.

36
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.720
Who'll lead the army if none
of us are left to lead them?


37
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.609
We're not irreplaceable, my old friend.

38
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.445
Our numbers may have dwindled,
but have tested it.


39
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.440
We found its weakness
and we could've beaten it today.


40
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.921
It was only if James hadn't broken rank.

41
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.840
But he did.

42
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.811
His courage and desire to protect
his brothers led him to his death.


43
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.327
- Nobody can have such luck.
- With honor.


44
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.928
With honor.

45
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.368
Blood,

46
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.048
fury,

47
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.846
dragon strength.

48
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.968
Blood,

49
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.808
fury,

50
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.005
dragon strength.

51
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.482
Blood,

52
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.402
fury,

53
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.687
dragon strength.

54
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.321
Relive again!

55
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.490
KNIGHTS OF THE DAMNED

56
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.120
170 YEARS AGO THE REALM
OF NAZROTH WAS IN CHAOS.


57
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.600
A TIME OF VICIOUS CIVIL WAR AND SORCERY

58
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.040
THAT TORE THE IDYLLIC WORLD
INTO 12 KINGDOMS.


59
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.920
THE MOST RESPECTED AND POWERFUL KINGDOM

60
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.680
IS THAT OF ZALDAH, WHOSE KING
XALVADOR HAS ENDEAVOURED


61
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.040
TO KEEP HARMONY IN THE FACE OF
NEIGHBOURING KINGDOMS PETTY FIGHTING.


62
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.880
THE BEASTS OF THE DARK KINGDOM
AND THE DRAGONS


63
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.680
HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN FOR GENERATIONS

64
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.600
AND THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVE
PEACE IN THE LAND.


65
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.160
BUT 9 MONTHS AGO THE DRAGON SCREAMS
ONCE AGAIN FILLED THE SKIES


66
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.320
AND KING XALVADOR'S
WESTERN CASTLE WAS BOMBARDED


67
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.680
WITH UNPROVOKED ATTACKS.

68
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.600
TO RESTORE PEACE
AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF HIS PEOPLE


69
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.760
THE KING ORDERED 12 OF HIS BEST KNIGHTS
TO SLAY THE BEAST.


70
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.280
THE ROYAL WARRIORS CHASED
THE DRAGON AWAY FROM ZALDAH,


71
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.800
A FIGHT OF TEETH AND BLADE, 
FIRE AND STEEL.

72
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.480
AS EACH BATTLE CLAIMED ANOTHER LIFE,

73
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.000
THE KNIGHTS FEEL A DARKNESS
GROWING IN THE LAND...


74
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.286
NAZROTH IS CHANGING AGAIN...

75
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.408
Halt.

76
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.168
Who goes there?

77
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.688
Henry?

78
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.728
Is that you?

79
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.400
For a man who writes
such beautiful poetry, Thomas,


80
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.920
you rarely appreciate the beauty
that's all around you.


81
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.206
I do appreciate beauty.

82
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.291
To fight with such heroism is a thing
of beauty, Thomas. You do that every day.


83
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.560
Are you saying I'm
a thing of beauty, George?

84
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.882
We are brother in arms.
Let us leave it at that.


85
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.651
So today?

86
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.286
Ah, today...

87
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.960
Today, we shall do battle
under the glorious king's name


88
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.320
where we shall slay that beast and
turn everything right in this kingdom.


89
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.960
The key to killing a beast
is down to its whys and wherefores.


90
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.120
This one eludes me.

91
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.283
It's just a dragon, Thomas.
It doesn't know any whys or wherefores.


92
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.447
- You don't know that.
- It just kills.


93
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.927
So do we.

94
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.248
But something has changed in this dragon.

95
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.800
Violence wasn't always her folly.
Something made her attack the castle.


96
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.680
Nowhere else in our kingdom
nor in our neighbor's kingdoms.


97
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.449
I've chased down many beasts before.

98
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.360
Every one gave up their secrets
before they died.


99
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.408
Not all of your women were beasts, Thomas.

100
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.525
But each one of them gave up
their secrets. That's for sure.


101
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.449
But this dragon, it was
a peaceful sort before all of this.


102
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.769
It stayed away from populated areas.

103
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.880
And now it seems this particular one

104
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.203
wants a bite out of the powerful king
and the kingdom itself.


105
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.564
You know, I admire it.

106
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.689
I admire it for evading death.

107
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.684
There aren't many dragons
and all they have are adversaries.


108
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.400
Surely, its strength
and its will to survive will fade


109
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.360
and solitude will kill it for us.

110
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.842
It will survive alone,
until in battle it dies alone.


111
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.011
That is the king's orders.

112
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.406
We must make haste.

113
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.080
We have a quest to fulfill
and we are down to just three.


114
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.040
- Are you keen to do battle, George?
- Keen to keep order.


115
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.010
- That means battle.
- You remind me of when you were a child.


116
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.407
Always the first to battle
and always against the bigger boys.


117
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.840
They were trying to steal
your mother's bread.


118
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.684
You nearly killed the poor wretches.

119
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.761
- You had my back.
- How could I not?


120
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.480
Do you ever think of the kingdom?

121
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.087
Not as much as I used to from whence
we began these adventures.


122
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.730
King's orders will take us
on the righteous path.


123
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.285
Be quick with the water.
I'll be with your horses.


124
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.129
I know you're tired, old friend.

125
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.645
It's nearly over.

126
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.611
Yeah, I miss her, too.

127
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.881
What happened?

128
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.361
Water demons.

129
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.370
- You?
- White wolf.


130
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.161
How did you escape?

131
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.766
Unseen archers in the woods somewhere.

132
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.566
Ours erupted from the forest,
killing the beasts.


133
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.122
Let's move.

134
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.645
This is dark magic, 
George, the darkest.

135
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.966
Pull yourself together, Thomas.

136
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.924
We'll soon be behind
the safety of the castle walls.


137
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.000
This, I fear, penetrates
even the castle walls, George.


138
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.765
This is deeper, this
we should have fear of.

139
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.681
It's taunting us.

140
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.444
It's just a dragon, Thomas,
it knows nothing of taunting.


141
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.804
It does. It's drawing us out
for the final blow.


142
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.171
Then, let's not disappoint it.

143
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.640
If the dragon is headed home, it bodes
well for us, we'll get reinforcements.


144
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.920
If not, we continue until
King Xalvador's wishes are fulfilled


145
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.491
and the dragon is slain.

146
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.840
While it is here fighting us,

147
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.003
it is not besieging the castle
and killing our people.


148
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.608
Trust me, both of you.
We will be home soon enough.


149
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.885
It's been many months, we're down to three.

150
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.801
We could've picked up
reinforcements along the way.


151
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.202
Plenty of folk willing to join us.

152
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.681
Gather your things.

153
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.168
There's not many who could stay
that and still be standing.


154
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.008
Kettlage village is up ahead.
There, we rest for the night.


155
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.641
George.

156
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.769
Careful.
He has a madness.


157
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.961
A fun evening of Ale and bar fights
by the looks of things.


158
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.209
Leprosy?
Some kind of sickness?


159
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.165
Seek religious council.

160
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.043
Many gods and their servants
will tend to you.


161
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.889
I'll have some of what you've been having.

162
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.081
<i>Hey, baby, won't come
along where the sun is shining bright?</i>


163
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.320
<i>I promise if you do that, I'd be taking
care of you for an afternoon delight</i>


164
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.040
<i>then she says, "Hey, now, hold your horses,</i>

165
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.840
<i>I'm sure that we got time."
But then I say,</i>


166
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.845
<i>"Hey, ho, I'm sure we do,
as long as I got you."</i>


167
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.251
We need rest for the night.

168
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.280
They're not locals, we should be cautious.

169
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.800
I'm George Letholdus,
King Xalvador's royal...


170
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.928
King Xalvador's royal warriors.

171
00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.880
Guards, please,

172
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.166
warm yourselves.

173
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.009
These are the king's royal warriors.

174
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.684
And maybe the sun
will rise again or maybe not.


175
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.800
Please sit. I'll bring you whatever you wish.

176
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.928
Wine and four jugs of beer.

177
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.722
Please.

178
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.848
Luanda,

179
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.851
take these drinks

180
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.920
and warm these gentlemen.

181
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.729
Never trust anyone, do you? Hey!

182
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.364
Bryce, I'mma tell you,
don't you start in my bar.


183
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.728
They're the king's men.
Yeah.


184
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.321
Same for you!

185
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.283
He's calling you, your boyfriend.

186
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.604
I'm warning you, okay?

187
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.246
Who is the gentleman
who speaks in such hostility?


188
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.448
Oh,

189
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.005
he's just an untrusting soul. He's nothing.

190
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.328
What's his name?

191
00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.966
I don't remember.

192
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.603
They ask of his name.

193
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.561
It's Bryce.

194
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.728
Bryce Jefferson.

195
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.281
Now, please.

196
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.040
Have you any more thoughts of going home,
George, since we're so close?


197
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.326
You must go home.

198
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.400
Oh, yes. To your mystery lady friend.
What was her name?


199
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.686
Never you mind.

200
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.644
The stable girl, that's it.
It's been a long time.


201
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.640
We'll return home and the beast is slain.

202
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.930
If the dragon does head to the castle,
then so shall we, not before.


203
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.808
- To our fallen.
- With honor.


204
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.605
Four of your best and
a room for the night.

205
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.601
Katori's.

206
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.970
They're strange kingdom.

207
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.211
Female warriors, huh?

208
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.450
Have caution, my friend.

209
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.242
Be careful for they'll have your tongue.

210
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.005
They'll have it all right.

211
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.448
Ladies.

212
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.489
You know, I've fallen for you.

213
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.970
Come have a drink with us.

214
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.801
We're fine here.
But you may take a seat at our table.


215
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.286
Here we go again.

216
00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.690
You're from Katori, right?

217
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.848
We are.

218
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.361
- What are you doing in the King's land?
- He's your king, not ours.


219
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.531
But it's still his land.

220
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.369
We're not here to spy,
if that's what concerns you.


221
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.246
We're just passing through.

222
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.720
My name is Dimia.

223
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.208
Phrowenia, Kateya, Isabel.

224
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.887
You are George and Richard of the
King Xalvador's warriors, are you not?


225
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.844
- And you are?
- Thomas.


226
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.524
And you say you're not a spy,
you're very well-informed.


227
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.371
Your reputation precedes you.

228
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.931
Wait, how come mine doesn't?

229
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.729
You said you were passing through.

230
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.648
Where to?

231
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.051
I'm sure you know already, Sir George.

232
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.048
Maybe.

233
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.528
Humor me.

234
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.207
We're traveling to the southern
border of the Atayan Kingdom.


235
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.886
- You're not gonna start a war, are you?
- No.


236
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.484
Simply to close a matter
sensitive to the Katori people.


237
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.240
You're gonna seek revenge
on the Atayan soldiers?


238
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.811
It is what is right.

239
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.689
I trust your silence will be ensured.

240
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.562
We have no war with the Katoris.

241
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.807
Our silence is ensured.

242
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.289
May the gods watch over you.

243
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.247
Where were the gods when the
Atayan soldiers savaged that poor girl?


244
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.600
Who were they watching over then?

245
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.923
With every battle, I wonder more
and more the intention of them,


246
00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.969
even the existence of the gods.

247
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.411
For those of us who has survived
too many battles, we often feel that way.


248
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.363
We are surrounded by bloodshed and trauma
and stalked by the shadow of the death.


249
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.807
But if you look close enough,
there's beauty and wonder all around us.


250
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.368
True enough.

251
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.611
And whilst blood still remains inside us,
it's not a time for sadness.


252
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.648
Innkeep.

253
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.971
Oh, more. More.

254
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.201
White tips.

255
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.451
Just like at the water.

256
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.010
How will I ever live it down,
rescued by a woman?


257
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.685
Go on!

258
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.521
<i>Hey, baby, won't you come along
where the sun is shining bright?</i>


259
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.440
<i>I promise if you do that, I'd be taking
care of you for an afternoon delight</i>


260
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.684
<i>then she says hey, now, hold your horses,
I'm sure that we got time,</i>


261
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.846
<i>then I say, hey ho, 
I'm sure we do</i>

262
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.250
<i>as long as I got you now</i>

263
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.244
When I was sitting over there earlier
and listening to their conversations,


264
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.245
- there have been some attacks here.
- In this village?


265
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.048
So they say. You can tell
drunk men and their stories.


266
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.563
They call them the Fury.

267
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.961
The Fury.
That's catchy, I guess


268
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.047
Maybe it's true.

269
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.051
If the stories are real,

270
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.920
the threat to the Royal family
and our Kingdom is greater than ever.


271
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.080
The Dragon is heading
God knows where, now this?


272
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.164
My friend, we've been
on the road for eight months.


273
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.844
You need a rest as much as I do.
It's just a few hours till sunrise.


274
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.930
The attacks mainly happen at night.

275
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.322
Shelters through the night would be nice.

276
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.089
Are you spying on us, girl?

277
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.089
So you wanna know about the Fury.

278
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.568
That's right, they exist.

279
00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.401
Wretched,

280
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.841
deformed,

281
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.647
furious.

282
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.680
- How do you know all this?
- I've seen them.


283
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.569
Well, in the shadows,

284
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.004
skulking through the darkness.

285
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.566
And where was this?

286
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.247
Northern Territory,

287
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.087
three weeks ago.

288
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.961
I rode off as fast as I could.

289
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.366
- How brave of you.
- Are you questioning me, woman?


290
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.201
You bitch.

291
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.081
Back off!

292
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.802
Would everyone just calm down?

293
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.928
Fight!

294
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.561
Enough!

295
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.088
What?

296
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.171
He went for his sword.

297
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.001
Under the command of the King's royal guard,

298
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.362
you will all stand down immediately.

299
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.205
These visitors are our allies.
There will be no more of this.


300
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.201
That's it.

301
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.485
We're closed for the night.

302
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.681
Go home!

303
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.211
Go on all of you.

304
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.045
I trust you have rooms
for us to rest our heads.


305
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.561
Certainly, Sir.

306
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.641
The Knights and their allies
are always welcome.


307
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.888
Thank you.

308
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.687
Get some rest.
We leave at dawn.


309
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.445
Leave me alone!

310
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.641
Restful night or dreaming of warrior women?

311
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.800
You look rough old friend.

312
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.565
I feel like I've had a barrel
of Galdarian wine last night.


313
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.768
You did.

314
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.566
Now we're all here.

315
00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.644
We're no longer chasing Dragons this day.

316
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.484
We have to push hard
to make it to the castle by tomorrow.


317
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.606
What if we do
encounter these fury en route?

318
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.082
We slay them as
we would any other threat.

319
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.641
Once we were twelve, now we're only three.

320
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.528
I know.

321
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.160
We just have to
make it to the castle.

322
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.403
There's be a battalion of soldiers ready
to protect the people of our Kingdom.


323
00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.208
We all have loved
ones there, do we not?

324
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.681
- We do.
- And what of the Katori women?


325
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.120
I assume they left at sunrise.

326
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.400
Eager to reach their mark
and return to their borders.


327
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.371
We need to be cautious my friend,
there are dark powers at play.


328
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.686
That there are, brother.

329
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.121
That there are.

330
00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.280
In days of olde when Knights were bold
and the world was flat as parchment,


331
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.363
we would walk around and not fall down...

332
00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.160
Your Highness, 
Princess Elizabeth.

333
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.447
- Your Highness, Princess Elizabeth.
- If you please...


334
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.041
Enough.

335
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.888
Continue.

336
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.000
The news I bring may not be
for a lady's ears.


337
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.767
Her ears have endured far worse
than any news you can bring, Nicolas.


338
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.286
As have my eyes.

339
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.202
Very well, Your Highness, 
Prince Favian.

340
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.000
Last night we had a breach of the village
boundary from the East.


341
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.048
Three of them. 
They're getting closer.

342
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.128
What would father have us do?

343
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.208
My Lord?

344
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.885
For goodness sake, Favian.

345
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.171
I'm not the King.

346
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.531
I say we wait for father's order

347
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.725
as to what to
do about this, Fury disease.

348
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.320
Sir, your father bestowed upon you

349
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.085
a great battalion of men
to protect this region,


350
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.961
but you have them scattered in small groups.

351
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.042
Forgive me, my lord, but I feel
our soldiers are ineffective in this way.


352
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.928
- We are losing men to unseen...
- I am happy with our current strategy.


353
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.611
Your troops will send movements of this Fury,

354
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.526
but only to me.

355
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.604
- But, my Lord, I feel we...
- Ah, thank you, Nicolas.


356
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.288
You are right.

357
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.760
No amount of Fury blood

358
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.731
can match what sears my eyes
and haunts my ears within these walls.


359
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.967
Do not spread the word, Darling.

360
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.000
We don't want these peasants

361
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.765
clambering inside
the castle walls, now do we?


362
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.323
Our father would have already
had them inside if he had known.


363
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.804
You have the same weakness
as father, Elizabeth.


364
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.243
Cursed with misguided compassion,

365
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.440
yet little shown to your dearest brother.

366
00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.328
Now, tell me,

367
00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.969
how long before they reach us?

368
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.889
They're already at the village.

369
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.085
What do you think about
these rumors of furious beasts?


370
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.129
There is fear in the air.

371
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.969
There's much talk of strange
things stalking the shadows.


372
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.569
We've been to the farthest reaches of
the kingdom, we haven't seen anything.


373
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.001
They're merely rumors.

374
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.650
There will be proof there's nothing more.

375
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.807
These rumors are of the dead walking,

376
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.160
these rumors are of the dead
fighting with unquenchable thirst.


377
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.685
- They're too prolific for us to ignore.
- The dead?


378
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.485
- Ridiculous.
- Yes.


379
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.769
In the village they spoke
of bodies ravaged by animals


380
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.807
- and many missing entirely.
- Where?


381
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.520
The Katori women said in the Gelder Valley.

382
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.640
Where the fast river
comes down from the mountain.


383
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.246
These are just stories
of the dead, utter nonsense.


384
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.162
We shouldn't waste our time discussing it.

385
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.085
The legend says they were dead,
now they're not.


386
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.086
Now, there's something else.

387
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.048
What?

388
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.331
Something's over there.

389
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.128
Well,

390
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.446
that one got away.

391
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.127
Are you sure hunting is your forte, Bryce?

392
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.045
I'm the village's best hunter,

393
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.288
maybe the lands.

394
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.890
Well, from what I hear, you were
bested by a woman at the tavern.


395
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.601
I was not.

396
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.566
Anyway, there was four of them.

397
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.844
Now this gets interesting.

398
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.482
So, you were beaten by a girl...
oh, four girls.


399
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.570
They were Katoris, Milli.

400
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.288
Yeah.

401
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.491
I was defending our honor,
our village's honor.


402
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.165
They attacked all of us.

403
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.691
And those three royal knights.

404
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.050
They didn't just attack me.

405
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.605
They attacked all of us.

406
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.763
Oh, yes. I heard some
of the king's men were in town.


407
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.882
There's nothing better than a knight.

408
00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.481
Don't you think?

409
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.605
Men of honor?

410
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.400
Us townsmen,

411
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.366
we're honorable, too.

412
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.571
We look after the people
in the villages, towns.


413
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.241
Anyway,

414
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.091
this is why we're here,

415
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.011
to learn how to hunt,

416
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.241
how to kill.

417
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.770
You really think those stories are real?

418
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.280
Are they not the words of those seeking
to strike fear into our heart?


419
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.805
Listen to me, Milli.

420
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.241
They are real.

421
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.409
And that is why we're here.

422
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.486
I don't know how
many of them there are

423
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.009
I've come for them.

424
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.811
I need you to be ready.

425
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.571
Why else did we come?

426
00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.209
That's big. What are
you gonna do about it?

427
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.281
Not me.

428
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.881
You.

429
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.650
Aim for the heart.

430
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.686
Right beneath the shoulder.

431
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.769
What if I can't kill it?

432
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.288
I'll finish him.

433
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.320
Just make sure you get a good strike.

434
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.280
I don't think I can kill something.

435
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.851
That's exactly why we're here.

436
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.765
You need to learn
how to take a life.

437
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.123
How to survive what is coming.

438
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.451
I'll go west.

439
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.444
I'll finish it if you
don't get a clean kill.

440
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.086
You got a spear.

441
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.326
So, make it count.

442
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.964
Millicent, no, run!

443
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.886
Everything all right, Thomas?

444
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.841
I'm good. Just worry about your own health.

445
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.280
I've warned you before.
Waking up with a sore head from ale


446
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.806
is better than getting something
from women like that.


447
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.691
Did she tell you that she loves you?

448
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.200
Love is the poison chalice of my life.
Heartbreak sits at bottom of that cup.


449
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.681
You never can resist
that last sip, can you?

450
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.685
No, sir, I could not.

451
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.560
You still blame all
your misfortunes on women.


452
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.320
And you never thought
someone could understand you.


453
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.880
- You got me an antidote?
- An antidote?


454
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.090
I've seen your antidote. You've slept
with a different woman in every village.


455
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.922
I don't think that's working for him.

456
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.605
Nope. Nor I.

457
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.840
Wish I could get
me an antidote for this.

458
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.129
We better all get some rest.
We can let him sleep it off.


459
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.730
Don't you worry about me.
Keep your eyes open for those Fury things.


460
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.080
I'll take first watch.

461
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.009
Richard, you rest up.

462
00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.801
- I'll take the first.
- I'm fine. It's okay.


463
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.764
That's an order.
Rest well.


464
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.851
You're a good man, George.

465
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.326
You're a good man.

466
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.488
No.

467
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.489
Dead of flesh and the diseased in blood.

468
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.921
Thomas.

469
00:41:59.040 --> 00:41:59.848
What?

470
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.761
Thomas!

471
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.120
Stand down.

472
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.569
Do not become my enemy, brother.

473
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.488
You're delirious.

474
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.441
You were poisoned?

475
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.007
Wake up.

476
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.840
This is dark magic.

477
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.490
Thomas, wake up!

478
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.280
George, what are you doing?

479
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.566
What am I doing?

480
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.690
- Brother.
- Brother.


481
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.406
Yes, brother.

482
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.485
You were sleepwalking again,
only this time fighting as well.


483
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.520
For the love of
God, you almost killed me.

484
00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.482
I did? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I mean, I had no...


485
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.128
Just then when you were asleep,
what were you dreaming of?


486
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.240
I don't know. I woke up
to see his blade pointed at me.


487
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.526
Come on, man. Think.

488
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.924
A rush of things,
violence for the most of it.


489
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.723
But I dream about violence most nights.

490
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.880
This is why your nights are so disturbed.

491
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.600
You have to come to peace
with the things we see.


492
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.040
It was different.

493
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.406
I felt anger.

494
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.123
I often see violence,
but I never feel angry in life.


495
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.006
I don't carry hatred.

496
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.403
I know we all serve a purpose
regardless of who we hurt.


497
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.482
There's always belief in what we do.

498
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.880
We all believe
that what we're doing is right.


499
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.880
So, I can't hate even enemies.

500
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.806
But this time, real anger
coursed through my veins, hatred.


501
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.651
I think you've been poisoned.

502
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.520
Maybe the Katori women
weren't as friendly as we first thought.


503
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.960
Maybe all this talk of creatures and Fury

504
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.920
was about distracting us
from their true intentions.


505
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.764
Maybe they were of poisonous intent.

506
00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.400
But the story of the Fury
came from the villagers.


507
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.404
It's passed. Whatever was
in my blood has passed, George.


508
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:04.928
I feel fine.

509
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.328
Come on.

510
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.282
I'll keep this just for now.

511
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.642
I haven't seen that dragon for a while.

512
00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.481
- Do you think he's reached the castle?
- I pray that it hasn't.


513
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.126
The final push.
You're gonna make it?


514
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.764
Something's wrong.
There is a dark magic in the air.


515
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.488
Let's move.

516
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.643
- Help!
- Help us.


517
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.360
Open the gate!

518
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.200
You have locked them out there to die.
Those creatures are out there!


519
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.681
There will be untold pain upon this land!

520
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:35.526
Your love for the people
is why father favors you to replace him.


521
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.841
Yet his wisdom doesn't seem to understand

522
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.170
people are not as important as their leaders.

523
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.490
There are no leaders
without people, you fool.


524
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.083
Dare to call me a fool again, sister,

525
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.325
and I will punish you in ways
that your mind does not comprehend.


526
00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.800
I am the first born,
the son of the king.

527
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.245
I, alone,

528
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.920
will rule this kingdom
upon our father's passing.


529
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.651
You had better get used
to serving me, sister,


530
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.445
in the ways your king will see fit.

531
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.128
Yes, my lord.

532
00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.961
Come, Nicolas.

533
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.091
We have work to do.

534
00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.686
We're going on foot and with caution.

535
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.206
What's happened here?

536
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.486
Where are the villagers?

537
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.966
Where are the soldiers?

538
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.689
Could the dragon have done this?

539
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.931
There would be more damage.

540
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.288
Maybe they fled to
the safety of the castle.

541
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.962
Whatever happened here,
our priority is the royal family.


542
00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.002
Let's get out of here
before something bad happens.


543
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.729
I guess the stories were true.

544
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.246
Looks like we're heading
for a pretty good fight.


545
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.205
When have we not?
This is just another day.


546
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.240
Take them.

547
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.240
Better get on your feet, old friend.

548
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.482
Come on, we can't carry you and fight.

549
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.769
I'm fit to fight, my friend.

550
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.606
Nothing can stop me.

551
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.606
What of the horse?

552
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.646
We can't go back.

553
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.281
Curious.

554
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.606
They're just beasts.

555
00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.121
Hard to kill.

556
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.809
How far does this fury spread?

557
00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.480
Richard, get him up.

558
00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.085
I'm fine.

559
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.249
Come on, on your feet, Thomas.

560
00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.640
Saved you again.
It's becoming a habit.


561
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.801
Yeah. It is.

562
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.040
You said you were going to the border.

563
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.120
We were overrun by these Fury.
They've cut us off.


564
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.691
They're coming from all directions.

565
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.010
They're everywhere.
Watch out!


566
00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.846
A little more even.

567
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.008
A little.

568
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.966
Is he hurt bad?

569
00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.209
He's losing blood.
He's weak.


570
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.086
Who you calling weak?

571
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.560
You haven't lost your pride
with your blood, then.


572
00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.051
Nope. Get me up.

573
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.800
You okay?

574
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.768
In much pain?

575
00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.120
Ask again and I'm
gonna show you much pain.

576
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.008
Fair enough.

577
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.206
How'd you do that?

578
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.811
It's a long story.

579
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.124
- How far is it your castle?
- A mile or so.


580
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.369
- May I ask that we...
- Yeah.


581
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.524
Of course. You can seek shelter
in the castle boundaries.


582
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:32.606
You better take all their weapons
from them like they took mine. Untrust.


583
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.609
Ignore him.
It's a long story.


584
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.249
I've never seen anything like this before.

585
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.321
Nor I.

586
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.208
We have traveled and fought
in every region of this kingdom.


587
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.321
Never like this.

588
00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.000
We were supposed to meet
a contact in the Retan township,


589
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.366
but it was decimated.

590
00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.481
Bodies everywhere,

591
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.481
like they were ripped from limb to limb.

592
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.207
The surrounding towns were deserted.
That's when we started to see them.


593
00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.411
We hadn't really seen them.

594
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.405
We're starting to think
the stories were just stories.


595
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.482
Then we got to our village, and...

596
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.646
they're no myth.

597
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.961
Look, I really appreciate you taking us in.

598
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.889
Foreign warriors inside the castle walls.

599
00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.086
These are strange times.

600
00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.321
I think both our peoples will need allies.

601
00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.041
One step at a time.

602
00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.929
Defensive positions over him.

603
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.481
Move!

604
00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:08.128
- We need to get inside the castle.
- No arguments from me.


605
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.164
- Is he alive?
- Yes.


606
00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.284
- Conscious?
- Barely.


607
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.681
Thank the gods.

608
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.488
Where's lsabel?

609
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.408
She's gone.

610
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.128
Get him up.

611
00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.166
Sir, we must make haste.

612
00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.041
Prepare the horses.

613
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.686
Where are we going?

614
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:44.968
We?

615
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.926
We're going nowhere, sister.

616
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.760
I am... we are going...

617
00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.002
- A scouting mission.
- Now?


618
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.080
But why would you go out there?
You never leave the castle without...


619
00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.366
Silence, woman!

620
01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.487
I'm sorry.

621
01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.044
I'm leaving you here to rot

622
01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.400
whilst I ride to safety.

623
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.520
This Kingdom will be overrun

624
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.809
with a bigger army
than anyone has ever seen before,


625
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.328
more powerful and more destructive,

626
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.767
so that all twelve kingdoms
will fall at my feet.


627
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:34.888
And Father

628
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.480
will see that I destroyed

629
01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.767
an entire army of his

630
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.161
and get nothing but a royal finger wag.

631
01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.722
And my so-called father

632
01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.567
would rather have you

633
01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.045
on the throne than his own son.

634
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.124
You are not my brother.

635
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.164
Father needs to realize

636
01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.529
that this time requires a powerful man,

637
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.165
not a silly little girl.

638
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.640
I did not choose to lead, Favian.

639
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.122
It's father's will and while
he's still alive, he's our King.


640
01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.649
How could you question that?

641
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.011
Father's will you say?

642
01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.962
You think he doesn't know
about you and your Knight?


643
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.368
You think I don't know

644
01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.324
when I wanted you

645
01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.601
to lay with me.

646
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.371
I'm your sister, Favian.

647
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.405
Which is why

648
01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.165
I need an army

649
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.681
of my own,

650
01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.731
to wipe out

651
01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.882
the nayers and take a grip,

652
01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.848
to take control of this charter

653
01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.164
and rip out the hearts

654
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.809
of those that try and deny my birthright.

655
01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.571
Even your own father?

656
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.287
Everyone!

657
01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.480
I will fill the streets and rivers

658
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.850
with blood of anyone
that chooses to oppose me.


659
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.444
I will rule this Kingdom

660
01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.564
and I will rule

661
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.362
every Kingdom!

662
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.410
What have you done?

663
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.328
Take that

664
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.804
to the dungeon.
Ensure it's locked away with the others.


665
01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.840
Now!

666
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.321
And wait for me by the west gate.

667
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.200
Now, sister,

668
01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.601
I think

669
01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.450
- we should have a little chat.
- Favian, please!


670
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.608
Thomas!

671
01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.727
Thomas, wait.

672
01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.967
George, it's not his fault. He did not
betray, you just remember that.


673
01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.368
Thomas!

674
01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.721
Are you sure?

675
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.528
End him.

676
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.921
Rise.

677
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.920
Focus your rage.

678
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.525
Tear their flesh

679
01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.122
and disease their blood.

680
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.483
Open the door. Undo the bolts.
We're the King's Knights.


681
01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.366
Open the door.

682
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.281
Lower the blade.

683
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.560
But, Sir, they are not our infantry.

684
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.120
They fight with us to protect the Kingdom.

685
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.729
Obey my commands and release her.

686
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.011
Never question me again, Ralph.

687
01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.840
I'm sorry, Sir George.

688
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.331
How's your leg?

689
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.568
It's okay.

690
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.080
I'm done.

691
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.209
After this battle, I am done.
I'm never fighting again.


692
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.321
I doubt that.

693
01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.601
Where is everyone?

694
01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.404
Let me take you to the princess.

695
01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.846
Happy to be home?

696
01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.046
Everything's back to normal.

697
01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.568
Sort of.

698
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.807
She made me wait for you.
I'm worried for her safety.


699
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.002
Your Highness!

700
01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:17.886
- Princess.
- George!


701
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.480
What happened to you? Who did this?

702
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.211
Favian. He's gone mad with power.

703
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.807
Where's the King?

704
01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.640
He's in the Northern Castle
overseeing mother and her illness.


705
01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.240
He knows not of what goes on here.

706
01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.080
The last weeks we have been
plagued by this dark force.


707
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:35.801
Every messenger we have sent out
has been killed. The villages are empty.


708
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.249
Favian has something to do with it.

709
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.320
He was talking of a
huge army he had raised.

710
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.560
And there's more.

711
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.167
Father sent you on a mission to kill
the Dragon that besieged the castle.


712
01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.570
- I know why it was attacking us.
- Go on.


713
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.520
Favian had a dragon egg.
He talked of more in the dungeons below.


714
01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.640
That explains why it's attacking the castle.

715
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.600
They've never come this far in before.

716
01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.171
Mother wants her eggs back.

717
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.168
Where's Favian? 
We must stop him.

718
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.685
We're never gonna catch him.

719
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.611
Yes.
Secure the castle.


720
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.082
How did you end up with our Knights?

721
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.485
The Fury have overrun
most of the surrounding areas.


722
01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.690
Your men were kind enough
to offer us shelter, My Lady.


723
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.480
The two of you?

724
01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.611
There were more of us.

725
01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.768
I'm sorry.

726
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.444
We have to get the princess to safety.

727
01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.240
I'm not more important than anyone else.

728
01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.687
You are to the Xalvadian people
and to the King.


729
01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.089
- What is it?
- You're gonna wanna see this.


730
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.210
Oh, my God. The beasts.

731
01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.971
That's his army.
How can he create such a thing?


732
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.282
- They'll overrun us!
- Hold your nerve.


733
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.361
George, they will eventually find a way in.

734
01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.006
And when they do,

735
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.800
they'll run to the North Castle
and slaughter everyone.


736
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.600
But the soldiers, the Xaldanian army...

737
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.489
The army won't see them coming.

738
01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.371
Even if they do,
they're damn near impossible to kill.


739
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.160
They'll slaughter every man,
every woman, every child.


740
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.924
They won't stop until we're wiped out.

741
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.442
We must do something to save our people.

742
01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.040
Ralph, with me.

743
01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.805
Richard, food and water
for everyone else, yourself included.


744
01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.166
I'll save you some.

745
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.480
The eggs are through there, sir.
I'll search for them.


746
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.051
Bring back what you find.

747
01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.085
There's only one egg, sir.

748
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.889
What do you plan to do?

749
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.208
George!

750
01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.920
A thousand footsteps moving as one
are heading towards us.


751
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.160
I know a safe place for the Princess,
if it pleases you.


752
01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.925
- We'll never be safe, we must stop them.
- How can we?


753
01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.560
Ralph, take the Princess to the stables
and saddle the fastest horses.


754
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.641
I'm not leaving.

755
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.451
Dimia, Phrowenia,

756
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.367
- you, too.
- And you?


757
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.965
What will you do?

758
01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.647
We'll distract them.

759
01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.325
Not for long enough.
You need us with you.


760
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.121
She's right, George.

761
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:26.284
If you order it, I'll stay and fight.
But is the one we run from.


762
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.689
We need to protect the princess.

763
01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.729
The Princess will be fine with me,

764
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.526
if you need to stay, sir.

765
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.606
I don't trust him.

766
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.122
- Nor I.
- Let's go to the horses.


767
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.969
Yes, all of us.
Let's go.


768
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.807
Fury.

769
01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:56.928
Get back.

770
01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:59.768
Now!

771
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.006
He's one of them.

772
01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.360
Richard, take them to the tunnels and leave.

773
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.480
I'll meet you by
the bridge of the river.

774
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.405
- But, George, there's safety in...
- I will hear no more of this.


775
01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.488
Go.

776
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.320
What of the egg?

777
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.481
Leave it with me.

778
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.800
- George, please.
- If you love me,


779
01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.769
if you love your people, you must go.

780
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.286
What are you doing?

781
01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.801
Staying with you.

782
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.643
- There's no need for it.
- I will not have you stand alone.


783
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.163
- I owe you a life debt.
- Pay it by protecting the princess.


784
01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.809
The road will be fraught with danger.
Richard cannot defend it all.


785
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.328
As you wish.

786
01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.402
I do.

787
01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.960
Then I'll stay.

788
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.725
Let's see if it's safe.

789
01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.970
- What are you doing?
- Ensuring the future of our Kingdom.


790
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.766
No.

791
01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.684
This is for the Kingdom.

792
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.806
How many arrows left?

793
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.201
I'll make them count.

794
01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.486
Hurry, Princess.
These tunnels lead to safety.


795
01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.685
- How much longer do we wait?
- Until he gets here.


796
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.162
We can't leave a King's knight behind.

797
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.362
Any longer and we'll leave at least one.

798
01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.840
I still got some
fight left in me yet.

799
01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.729
I thought you were done fighting.

800
01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.362
Time to go.

801
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.364
- We can't.
- She's right.


802
01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.525
- He ordered me to get you to safety.
- Wait.


803
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:02.888
You made it!

804
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.840
I thought you were gonna have horses.

805
01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.126
You're not dead yet?

806
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.488
After you.

807
01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.528
I'm fine.

808
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.008
I know.

809
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.211
Are you fit to fight?

810
01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.449
Always, sir. Always.

811
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.608
As are we.

812
01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.569
You're not going home after the mission?

813
01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.206
We will soon enough. First we'll help you
get your princess to the Kingdom.


814
01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.648
Your Highness,

815
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.205
we have to get you
back to the King safe.

816
01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.971
- Your brother...
- I know.


817
01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.881
It's becoming clear that the dark forces
ravaging our land are just the beginning.


818
01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.361
We must rally the troops
and protect the people.


819
01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.326
There's a war coming.

820
01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.728
Blood of the dragonlings
bring them near immortal life.


821
01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.404
Rise my fallen fury,

822
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.163
rise my fallen soul.

823
01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.049
Feel the power of my command.

824
01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.563
Feel the rage and fury
building up inside of you.


825
01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.728
Prepare for war!
