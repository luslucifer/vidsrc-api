Oh no, my dad's car.

00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:24.945
He's gonna kill me.

178
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.948
I can't believe it.

179
00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:30.117
I'm gonna kill him!

180
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:32.019
It's just a car, Douglas.

181
00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:32.953
It can be fixed.

182
00:08:32.987 --> 00:08:34.121
It's not just a car.

183
00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:35.623
It's a collector's item.

184
00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:37.058
I love this car.

185
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.161
I was gonna pass this
car on to Billy someday,


186
00:08:40.194 --> 00:08:41.228
but that's never happening now.

187
00:08:41.262 --> 00:08:42.296
Can you calm down?

188
00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:43.164
No, no, no.

189
00:08:43.197 --> 00:08:44.899
Every week it's
something new with him,


190
00:08:44.932 --> 00:08:46.934
a new video for his
internet followers,


191
00:08:46.967 --> 00:08:48.035
and a new pain in my ass.

192
00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.970
That's it, he's out.

193
00:08:50.004 --> 00:08:51.205
We have been over this before.

194
00:08:51.238 --> 00:08:52.773
You are not kicking him out.

195
00:08:52.807 --> 00:08:53.574
He's 21.

196
00:08:53.607 --> 00:08:54.975
When I was 21, you
know what I did?


197
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:56.110
I didn't have one job.

198
00:08:56.143 --> 00:08:59.780
I had two jobs, and I was
on my own busting my ass.


199
00:08:59.814 --> 00:09:01.615
Maybe if you were around more.

200
00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:02.249
Talk to him.

201
00:09:02.283 --> 00:09:03.317
At least show an interest.

202
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.553
I find that a little difficult

203
00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:07.354
when he's shooting video of
himself in a dinosaur costume


204
00:09:07.388 --> 00:09:09.123
shooting bottle
rockets out his ass!


205
00:09:09.156 --> 00:09:11.025
Show an interest
in his jet skiing.


206
00:09:11.058 --> 00:09:12.726
He has been talking
about wanting to be


207
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.028
a pro jet skier for years.

208
00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:15.229
He's a quitter.

209
00:09:15.262 --> 00:09:16.931
How are you gonna a pro at
anything when you're a quitter?


210
00:09:16.964 --> 00:09:19.233
I mean, as soon as
the going gets tough,


211
00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:20.968
he moves on to his
next adventure.


212
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:22.970
I don't ask for
much as a father.


213
00:09:23.003 --> 00:09:25.005
Just once, if he could
just see something through,


214
00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:26.841
one thing, focus on that.

215
00:09:26.874 --> 00:09:28.976
Jet skiing is what
he is passionate about.


216
00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:29.877
Oh, oh.

217
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.744
See? See?

218
00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:31.546
Right there, don't
try to defend him.


219
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.379
What kind of
future's jet skiing?


220
00:09:32.413 --> 00:09:34.815
He's just gonna
get a bitchin' tan,


221
00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:36.183
sell some knockoff sunglasses,

222
00:09:36.217 --> 00:09:38.252
and work out of
some beach shack.


223
00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:39.954
And you know I've
never told you this,


224
00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:41.956
you're an enabler and
you're codependent,


225
00:09:41.989 --> 00:09:43.390
- and you know what...
- Okay...


226
00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:45.626
I cannot talk to you
when you're like this.


227
00:09:48.062 --> 00:09:52.700
Great, my car and my wife.

228
00:09:52.733 --> 00:09:53.634
What a joke.

229
00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:55.369
God.

230
00:09:57.438 --> 00:09:59.073
Yes, sir.

231
00:09:59.106 --> 00:10:00.007
I feel you on that.

232
00:10:01.008 --> 00:10:03.410
When she's not happy,
you're not happy, huh?


233
00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:06.080
My damn kid, what
I'm gonna do with him?


234
00:10:06.113 --> 00:10:07.414
I mean, I called in a huge favor

235
00:10:07.448 --> 00:10:10.084
to get him this job that
he just threw it away.


236
00:10:10.117 --> 00:10:12.253
Forgive me for
eavesdropping Mr. Burnett.


237
00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:13.988
I didn't mean to
overhear anything.


238
00:10:14.021 --> 00:10:16.991
But I actually might
have a solution


239
00:10:17.024 --> 00:10:19.393
that could just solve all
your problems in one shot.


240
00:10:19.426 --> 00:10:21.829
- Yeah, right here.
- Oh, no.


241
00:10:21.862 --> 00:10:23.164
Whoa, that's really morbid.

242
00:10:23.197 --> 00:10:25.466
- No, no, I would not.
- Head area, the head area.


243
00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:27.201
Sir, I would not suggest that.

244
00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:29.803
You own an add agency, right?

245
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:30.871
Yeah.

246
00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:32.840
Okay, so if you can get
just one of your clients


247
00:10:32.873 --> 00:10:33.941
to sponsor a jet ski team,

248
00:10:33.974 --> 00:10:36.877
you look like the most
supportive dad in the world,


249
00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:38.746
you get rid of your kid
for the entire summer,


250
00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:41.048
and, the missus
there might give you


251
00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:43.150
a little bit of that
newlywed nookie,


252
00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.919
if you know what I'm saying.

253
00:10:44.952 --> 00:10:47.054
Well, what kind of nimrod

254
00:10:47.087 --> 00:10:49.456
would sponsor a
screw-up like Billy?


255
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.724
Huh, tell me that.

256
00:10:50.758 --> 00:10:52.293
A useful nimrod. [chuckles]

257
00:10:52.326 --> 00:10:53.961
Ah! Hot damn!

258
00:10:58.465 --> 00:10:59.601
Yeah, I don't know Mr. Burnett,

259
00:10:59.634 --> 00:11:02.002
but I was just checking out
Billy's followers earlier,


260
00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.837
he's got a couple
hundred thousand, right?


261
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.140
So you mix those numbers
with your sales skills.


262
00:11:07.074 --> 00:11:09.143
Trust me, I know
talent when I see it.


263
00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:11.045
I used to wrench for the
greatest jet skier of all time,


264
00:11:11.078 --> 00:11:12.346
this guy Jarid Harper, right?

265
00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:14.949
He's a five-time world
champion jet skier.


266
00:11:14.982 --> 00:11:18.152
Trust me when I say your
son Billy, he's really good.


267
00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:20.754
This Jarid Harper, is there
any way you can get him,


268
00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:22.890
you know like, to come onboard

269
00:11:22.923 --> 00:11:25.392
as Billy's personal
one-on-one coach?


270
00:11:25.426 --> 00:11:28.162
You know, at least for name
value or appearance sake?


271
00:11:28.195 --> 00:11:30.030
I like where you're going
with this, Mr. Burnett.


272
00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.232
Very smart.

273
00:11:31.265 --> 00:11:33.100
Yeah, yeah, Jarid actually
happens to be my best friend.


274
00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:34.435
Traveled the world with him.

275
00:11:34.468 --> 00:11:36.003
We've done lots of
crazy things together.


276
00:11:36.036 --> 00:11:37.204
We're very close.

277
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:40.841
So I could get the world's
greatest jet skier of all time


278
00:11:40.874 --> 00:11:42.776
to come out of retirement,
coach your son,


279
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.814
who's like the most badass,
extreme new rider on the planet.


280
00:11:46.847 --> 00:11:48.182
Come on, boom!

281
00:11:49.984 --> 00:11:54.255
Hot damn.

If you fall off, it'll
shut the motor off.

Now, this is the slow area.

285
00:12:02.863 --> 00:12:04.131
You gotta go slow here.

286

And you can go faster
once you reach the buoy.


287

Oh, okay, go fast to the buoy.

No, no, no, no, no, no, ah...

00:12:10.537 --> 00:12:12.940
No wake in this
area, okay, slow.

No waves until you
reach the buoy.

00:12:17.011 --> 00:12:20.080
Oh, wave to buoy?

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:22.950
No, no, no okay,
in this area...

Oh, yes, please.

Yes, I do.

And, no, you can't.

about you racing.

No, I'm talking about
you coaching a new kid.

you'd rather stay here

Huh, what does that do for ya?

320
00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:13.100
A new kid with a
full sponsorship?


321
00:13:13.133 --> 00:13:14.101
Is he really that good?

322
00:13:14.134 --> 00:13:16.036
Oh yeah, he reminds
me of you at his age.


323
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.072
He's fast and fearless.

324
00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:19.641
With a little guidance from you,

325
00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.375
he could be the
next Jarid Harper.


326
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.978
Look, I can't leave my
business for the whole summer.


327
00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:25.913
Your business?

328
00:13:25.946 --> 00:13:27.114
Come on, your business
is gonna be fine.


329
00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:29.383
Your employees can handle
things for a couple of months.


330
00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:31.885
Plus, you're gonna come
back with so much cash,


331
00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:34.021
you can buy yourself some
new skis, and you need 'em.


332
00:13:34.054 --> 00:13:35.155
Come on.

333
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.924
[sighs]

334
00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:38.525
There's always
a catch with you.


335
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.960
So come on, what is it?

336
00:13:39.993 --> 00:13:40.961
Huh, what, what catch?

337
00:13:40.994 --> 00:13:41.796
There's no catch.

338
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.163
Come on, we're
going on tour again!


339
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.498
That's it, up high!

340
00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:48.570
Sounds grand, but... pass.

341
00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:54.408
All right, well hey, you
know if you don't do this,...


342
00:13:55.342 --> 00:13:57.579
Richard is gonna tie
your record this year.


343
00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:00.682
Are you telling me
nobody's put that jackass


344
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:03.016
in his place yet?

345
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.552
You know what, never mind.

346
00:14:04.586 --> 00:14:05.587
I'm over it.

347
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.121
- You're over it?
- Yep.


348
00:14:07.154 --> 00:14:07.955
You're over it?

349
00:14:07.988 --> 00:14:08.922
Come on, man, it's me.

350
00:14:08.956 --> 00:14:09.990
Who are you kidding?

351
00:14:10.023 --> 00:14:11.425
That douche bag
ended your career.

00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:13.093
You have every
right to hate him.


353
00:14:13.127 --> 00:14:16.130
Now I know, I know,
you went backpacking


354
00:14:16.163 --> 00:14:17.599
through Europe with
a bunch of monks,


355
00:14:17.632 --> 00:14:19.601
you got all zenned out
and you came back saying,


356
00:14:19.634 --> 00:14:21.268
you know, "Things
happen for a reason,"


357
00:14:21.301 --> 00:14:22.670
and "The universe
will make it right."


358
00:14:22.704 --> 00:14:23.605
No, come on!

359
00:14:23.638 --> 00:14:24.505
You know what I say?

360
00:14:24.538 --> 00:14:27.307
I say we open up a
can of whoop-ass on


361
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:31.145
Champ, you need this
just as bad as I do.


362
00:14:31.178 --> 00:14:32.614
I do not need this.

363
00:14:32.647 --> 00:14:33.981
- You do not need this?
- No.


364
00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:34.783
Come on, I see it.

365
00:14:34.816 --> 00:14:36.350
You're carrying
around this grudge


366
00:14:36.383 --> 00:14:38.519
that's just gonna haunt
you the rest of your life.


367
00:14:40.454 --> 00:14:41.689
Okay, think about it.

368
00:14:41.723 --> 00:14:45.058
How long was it that your last
girlfriend stuck around, huh?


369
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:47.161
Well, a lot longer than any
girlfriend you've ever had.


370
00:14:47.194 --> 00:14:48.563
[laughs] Well yeah,
I mean, it's me.


371
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.063
You know, two lap
dances in a row


372
00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:51.265
is a long term
relationship, right?


373
00:14:51.298 --> 00:14:52.299
Huh? Come on!

374

Come on!

Oh my God, you're
leaving me hanging again?


376
00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:58.205
Champ, think about it this way.

377
00:14:58.238 --> 00:14:59.273
If you do this,

378
00:14:59.306 --> 00:15:01.275
you're gonna keep Richard
from tying your record,


379
00:15:01.308 --> 00:15:04.612
and you're giving something
else back to the sport,


380
00:15:04.646 --> 00:15:06.113
a new champion.

381
00:15:06.146 --> 00:15:08.415
It'll be like old
times, you and me,

But look, he drove in super
late last night, okay?

He's a young guy.

00:16:17.719 --> 00:16:18.485
He needs his sleep.

Just go easy on
him, okay? Please?

streaming live.

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:32.580
but he wanted us to take a bunch
of pictures of the program,


480
00:19:32.613 --> 00:19:35.348
and he's really interested
in seeing those.


481
00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:37.652
He wanted to make sure we
sent them off to him...


482
00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:43.591
[anthemic rock music]
[engine revving]


483
00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:53.233
[engine freewinding]

484
00:20:01.042 --> 00:20:03.010
Interesting how
Billy's dad hooks him up


485
00:20:03.044 --> 00:20:04.545
with a full sponsorship,

486
00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:07.380
and then just doesn't
show up today.


487
00:20:08.683 --> 00:20:10.718
I mean, yeah, he's
a busy guy, you know.


488
00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.519
He runs an add agency.

489
00:20:12.553 --> 00:20:13.320
We're the pros.

490
00:20:13.353 --> 00:20:15.056
He trusts us to
keep him updated.


491
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:16.858
So that must be
why he called you


492
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:19.594
to say he couldn't come,
and not his own son?


493
00:20:19.627 --> 00:20:20.895
Yeah, yeah, exactly, right.

494
00:20:22.997 --> 00:20:25.499
And then Billy rams the
ski up onto the beach,


495
00:20:25.532 --> 00:20:28.870
barely apologizes,
and then just bolts.


496
00:20:29.904 --> 00:20:30.905
Well, I mean, you know,

497
00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.573
that's probably just
because he was embarrassed


498
00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:34.041
about screwing up in
front of his hero.


499
00:20:34.075 --> 00:20:36.844
You know, "the"
Jarid Harper, huh?


500
00:20:36.878 --> 00:20:41.381
Yeah, yeah, that must
be what it is, yeah.


501
00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:42.516
- [groaning]
- Time to come clean, Dog!


502
00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.718
- Ah! Come on, come on!
- There's always a catch with


503
00:20:43.751 --> 00:20:45.452
- with you. Now, what is it?
- There's no catch, no catch!


504
00:20:45.485 --> 00:20:46.087
There's no catch, get off!

505
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.588
Get off, get off, get off!

506
00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:51.025
[groaning]

507
00:20:51.058 --> 00:20:52.894
I think you bruised
my manaconda.


508
00:20:52.927 --> 00:20:55.963
Well, maybe if you're lucky,
it'll swell up to adult size.


509
00:20:55.997 --> 00:20:56.764
[snaps clamp]

510
00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:57.765
- Now talk.
- All right, all right,


511
00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.499
all right, all right,
all right, all right.


512
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.969
Look, the deal is,...

513
00:21:03.738 --> 00:21:06.741
[sighs] Billy's a pain in
his dad's ass, all right?


514
00:21:06.774 --> 00:21:07.942
So his dad got him a sponsor

515
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.110
to get rid of him on
tour for the summer.


516
00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:10.477
That's it, that's
what's going on.


517
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.880
What are we, a
couple of babysitters?


518
00:21:12.914 --> 00:21:13.981
No.

519
00:21:14.015 --> 00:21:15.116
You know what, this
whole thing is a sham, Dog.


520
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:16.383
What were you thinking, huh?

521
00:21:17.852 --> 00:21:18.653
- No.
- I'm out.


522
00:21:18.686 --> 00:21:19.519
Come on, champ, no.

523
00:21:19.554 --> 00:21:21.556
You can't quit.

524
00:21:21.589 --> 00:21:22.790
I'm out.

525
00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:25.026
Come on, come on, Champ.

526
00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:25.860
[Jarid] Forget it.

527
00:21:25.893 --> 00:21:26.694
No, come on.

528
00:21:26.727 --> 00:21:27.929
You can't leave.
You saw his face.


529
00:21:27.962 --> 00:21:29.396
If you leave, he's got nothing.

530
00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:32.066
[Jarid] Fine, but you owe me.

531
00:21:33.935 --> 00:21:35.036
[Announcer]
Welcome to round one


532
00:21:35.069 --> 00:21:37.404
of the Azeo Distilleries Tour.

533
00:21:37.437 --> 00:21:39.006
There's added excitement
in the air today


534
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.975
thanks to the return of
the greatest champion


535
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:43.611
of all time, Jarid Harper.

536
00:21:43.644 --> 00:21:44.745
What'd I tell you?

537
00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:47.081
Just like old times, yeah champ?

538
00:21:47.114 --> 00:21:49.650
Love the smell of race
fuel in the morning.


539
00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:50.751
Smells like victory.

540
00:21:50.785 --> 00:21:55.790
[sexy hip-hop music]

541
00:22:07.168 --> 00:22:09.570
Yeah, just like old times.

542
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:13.674
[chuckling]

543
00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:14.542
Jarid!

544
00:22:15.643 --> 00:22:18.179
My goodness, you're
still on tour?


545
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:19.947
But of course.

546
00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:20.948
Hide the women.

547
00:22:20.982 --> 00:22:22.482
[chuckles] It's too late.

548
00:22:22.515 --> 00:22:23.450
Hey, hey, Billy!

549
00:22:23.483 --> 00:22:26.120
Billy, I want you to
meet Jean Paul Nukette,


550
00:22:26.153 --> 00:22:27.889
also known as Nuke.

551
00:22:27.922 --> 00:22:30.423
Also known as tet-a-peen.

552
00:22:30.457 --> 00:22:32.059
That's French for dickhead.

553
00:22:34.829 --> 00:22:36.429
Tell me, are you
still a virgin?


554
00:22:36.463 --> 00:22:38.599
- [mockingly laughing]
- You guys starting already?


555
00:22:38.633 --> 00:22:40.134
You know, Nuke's a freestyler.

556
00:22:40.167 --> 00:22:41.636
So basically he just competes

557
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:43.503
for a whopping two
minutes every weekend,


558
00:22:43.536 --> 00:22:45.907
and then he talks to girls
with his fancy French accent


559
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.174
and they all melt.

560
00:22:47.208 --> 00:22:49.176
This is a typical
weekend for Dog.


561
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.980
He just waxes on and
then he whacks off.


562
00:22:53.014 --> 00:22:53.915
[mockingly laughing]

563
00:22:55.182 --> 00:22:57.517
So Billy, you're so fast

564
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:59.020
they had to give you
three number ones?


565
00:22:59.053 --> 00:22:59.987
Yeah, I'll be
peeling two of 'em off


566
00:23:00.021 --> 00:23:01.454
by the end of the season.

567
00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:04.692
- I like your attitude.
- Yeah.


568
00:23:04.725 --> 00:23:06.493
I heard there was a
loose dog running around


569
00:23:06.526 --> 00:23:07.094
in these pits.

570
00:23:07.128 --> 00:23:08.596
Aw, you know it, baby!

571
00:23:08.629 --> 00:23:09.997
Come here, give the dog a bone.

572
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:11.065
[both moan]

573
00:23:11.098 --> 00:23:11.933
Good to see you.

574
00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:14.902
- Hi, champ.
- Hey.


575
00:23:14.936 --> 00:23:16.637
[Kelly] Oh, it's
been too long.


576
00:23:16.671 --> 00:23:17.872
Look at you.

577
00:23:17.905 --> 00:23:19.907
Little Kelly Weber
grows up to be beautiful


578
00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:22.877
and Hot Water Champion
from what I hear.


579
00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:23.778
[chuckles]

580
00:23:23.811 --> 00:23:26.948
- Very nice.
- Ah, Kelly, my dream woman.


581
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:27.982
[kissing]

582
00:23:28.015 --> 00:23:30.117
Save it Nuke.
[laughing]


583
00:23:30.151 --> 00:23:32.920
Hey, Kelly Weber, I'm Billy.

584
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:34.989
I've seen you in
all the magazines.


585
00:23:35.022 --> 00:23:36.924
Ah, you must be
Jarid's new protege


586
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:38.159
everyone's buzzing about.

587
00:23:38.192 --> 00:23:40.695
I am, and it is all true.

588
00:23:40.728 --> 00:23:42.229
[Summer] There you are.

589
00:23:42.263 --> 00:23:44.497
Oh, guys, this is Summer.

590
00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:46.067
She rides for Team Scream.

591
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.035
Hi, I'm Dog.

592
00:23:48.069 --> 00:23:51.038
Now you know what to team
scream later tonight.


593
00:23:51.072 --> 00:23:53.007
You should save your
breath for your blow-up doll.


594
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.942
I'm sure you'll need it.

595
00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:58.012
[laughing]

596
00:23:58.045 --> 00:23:59.647
Hello, my name is Nuke.

597
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.182
Oh, please keep
your lips off me.


598
00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:02.950
There's no telling
where they've been.


599
00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:04.986
Oh hey, team boobies.

600
00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:06.821
I like her.

601
00:24:06.854 --> 00:24:08.556
I'm sure you recognize Jarid.

602
00:24:08.589 --> 00:24:09.957
Of course, the legend.

603
00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:11.559
Hmm, nice to meet you.

604
00:24:11.592 --> 00:24:13.160
And his new rider, Billy.

605
00:24:13.194 --> 00:24:14.428
Hi.

606
00:24:14.462 --> 00:24:16.597
You must be pretty special
to be teamed up with this guy.


607
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.065
Yes, I am.

608
00:24:18.099 --> 00:24:20.301
Okay, and modest too.

609
00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:21.168
Yeah.

610
00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.171
Jarid Harper!

611
00:24:26.941 --> 00:24:28.275
How's the ah,.. how's the leg?

612
00:24:30.244 --> 00:24:31.312
Oh, whoops!

613
00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:33.014
Sorry about that, Richard.

614
00:24:33.047 --> 00:24:34.248
Don't worry, I'm
sure it'll come off


615
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:36.650
next time you shed your skin.

616
00:24:36.684 --> 00:24:37.918
It's all good, big dog.

617
00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:41.022
You and Jarid
go way back, huh?


618
00:24:41.989 --> 00:24:43.958
Yeah, ever since
I was a little girl.


619
00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:46.327
Him and my dad used to be
friends back in the day.


620
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.097
Kelly, team meeting,... Now.

621
00:24:51.165 --> 00:24:52.133
Whoa.

622
00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:55.002
Hey Richard, might want
to lay off the donuts.


623
00:24:55.036 --> 00:24:56.771
Gettin' a little muffin
top going on there.


624
00:24:56.804 --> 00:24:58.039
Gotta compete in a
different weight class.


625
00:24:58.072 --> 00:24:59.073
Oh yeah, real nice.

626
00:25:00.307 --> 00:25:03.010
Well, that was a nice visit.

627
00:25:04.078 --> 00:25:06.881
So you're racing on
Richard's team now, huh?


628
00:25:06.914 --> 00:25:08.716
I tried to contact
you for some advice


629
00:25:08.749 --> 00:25:11.886
when I got the offer, but no
one could seem to find you.


630
00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:14.722
Yeah, I was on a bit
of an extended vacation.


631
00:25:14.755 --> 00:25:16.791
Does he always boss
you around like that?


632
00:25:16.824 --> 00:25:18.125
Ever since she
went out with him.


633
00:25:18.959 --> 00:25:21.028
- [sighs]
- You dated that guy?


634
00:25:22.096 --> 00:25:24.799
Well, you know, we
were training together,


635
00:25:24.832 --> 00:25:25.966
and went to dinners, and then...

636
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.069
- Uh-huh
- I know, I know.

00:25:28.102 --> 00:25:29.136
yeah.

638
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.038
Thank you Summer for sharing.

639
00:25:31.072 --> 00:25:33.340
Maybe it's just that
bad boy thing we're into.


640
00:25:33.374 --> 00:25:34.842
- I don't know.
- Wow.

00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:36.377
You wanna see my tattoo?

642
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.845
- I have a tattoo here.
- No.


643
00:25:37.878 --> 00:25:39.080
Wait, you want
me to follow you?


644
00:25:39.113 --> 00:25:40.347
Ah...

645
00:25:40.381 --> 00:25:41.215
[Jarid] Settle down.

646
00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:43.617
Guys, I've gotta go.

647
00:25:43.651 --> 00:25:44.952
It was great to see you.

648
00:25:44.985 --> 00:25:46.220

[Announcer] The GP ski
pro class is on the line.


652
00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:53.828
All the top names are here,

653
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:57.031
and a new rider everyone is
excited to see, Billy Burnett.


654
00:25:57.064 --> 00:25:59.200
Expectations are running
high for this young man.


655
00:25:59.233 --> 00:26:02.236
It'll be interesting
to see what he can do.


656
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:03.971
All right, it's
first race of the year,


657
00:26:04.004 --> 00:26:05.706
so everyone's gonna be
charging into that first turn


658
00:26:05.739 --> 00:26:06.674
way over their heads.

659
00:26:06.707 --> 00:26:09.743
Stay inside. Ride smart.

00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:11.912

[Announcer] Newcomer
Billy Burnett is struggling


665
00:26:35.102 --> 00:26:38.072
in the chop, having trouble
negotiating the turns.


666
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.142
Come on, Billy!
Choose your lines.


667
00:26:47.748 --> 00:26:49.216
[Announcer] Burnett's
riding has been erratic,


668
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.918
but his speed is unquestionable.

669
00:26:50.951 --> 00:26:52.453
He's reeling in Richard Hurt,

670
00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:54.955
and is beginning to put
pressure on our leader.


671
00:27:01.295 --> 00:27:03.797
Burnett is closing the gap,
but it looks like Richard Hurt


672
00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:06.066
is just playing with
him at this point.


673
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.168
[Sam] Stop screwing around.

674
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:08.435
Burnett's coming
up on you quick.


675
00:27:11.972 --> 00:27:13.807
Richard, he's right
behind you. Come on.


676
00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:15.242
[Richard] I'm setting him up.

677
00:27:15.276 --> 00:27:17.011
Back off, Billy,
he's setting you up!


678
00:27:18.445 --> 00:27:20.181
[Announcer] Look out,
they're rubbing skis!


679
00:27:20.214 --> 00:27:21.482
Whoa-ho!

680
00:27:21.515 --> 00:27:22.950
And apparently Richard Hurt

681
00:27:22.983 --> 00:27:26.320
is giving Billy his
welcome to the pro class.


682
00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:27.922
Burnett has a few
things to learn,


683
00:27:27.955 --> 00:27:30.357
and Richard Hurt just
gave him his first lesson.


684
00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:34.328
Welcome to Sacramento
for round two


685
00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:36.797
of the Azeo Distilleries Tour.

686
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.465
Once again, it's Kelly Weber

687
00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:40.401
dominating the pro women's class

688
00:27:40.434 --> 00:27:43.070
aboard her Broward
Motorsports Kawasaki,


689
00:27:43.103 --> 00:27:45.839
lapping near the entire
field in the process.


690
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:47.141
As she crosses the finish line,

691
00:27:47.174 --> 00:27:49.076
she leaves no doubt
in anybody's mind


692
00:27:49.109 --> 00:27:51.979
that she is literally
in a class of her own.


693
00:27:54.815 --> 00:27:56.217
You should take
it easy out there.


694
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.484
You keep lapping all
the girls like that,


695
00:27:57.518 --> 00:27:59.386
they won't want to
race with you anymore.


696
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.254
That's okay.

697
00:28:00.287 --> 00:28:02.022
I want to race against
the men anyway.


698
00:28:02.056 --> 00:28:03.457
Oh, I'm scared.

699
00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.092
You should be,

700
00:28:05.125 --> 00:28:06.961
especially after the way
you rode last weekend.


701
00:28:07.795 --> 00:28:09.797
Okay, that's very nice.

702
00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:13.234
He is such a jerk.

703
00:28:13.267 --> 00:28:15.035
He parades different girls
around me like I care,


704
00:28:15.069 --> 00:28:17.304
and now he's giving me dirty
looks for talking to you.


705
00:28:17.338 --> 00:28:19.340
What ever happened
with him and Jarid?


706
00:28:19.373 --> 00:28:21.508
I heard that he
couldn't beat him,


707
00:28:21.543 --> 00:28:24.845
and so he slammed into
his ski and broke his leg.


708
00:28:24.878 --> 00:28:27.549
Yeah, and it happened on
the back side of the wave.


709
00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:29.083
Richard claims it
was an accident,


710
00:28:29.116 --> 00:28:32.386
and since nobody saw it,
that's how it was ruled.


711
00:28:33.287 --> 00:28:36.558
I guess Jarid's right, he
does give assholes a bad name.

to have a little fun

00:28:40.194 --> 00:28:41.095
with Burnett on the line.

715
00:28:41.128 --> 00:28:43.197
See if I can get him
to jump the start.


716
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:44.031
Focus on winning.

717
00:28:44.064 --> 00:28:45.099
Do what you do best.

718
00:28:45.132 --> 00:28:46.433
Go out there and ride
the way you ride and win.


719

[Announcer] The
rivalry developing


723
00:28:51.939 --> 00:28:53.941
between Hurt and
Burnett is obvious,


724
00:28:53.974 --> 00:28:56.110
as neither rider
wants to give an inch.


725
00:28:56.143 --> 00:28:57.378
Hurt jumps! Uh-oh!
[referee whistling]


726
00:28:57.411 --> 00:28:59.513
Burnett reacts and
completely jumps the start,


727
00:28:59.547 --> 00:29:01.181
catching the rubber
band under his neck.


728
00:29:01.215 --> 00:29:05.252
It pulls him off his ski in a
painful lesson of restraint.


729
00:29:05.286 --> 00:29:08.155
And Burnett takes the ride
of shame back to the line.

he will now have

Burnett will start in
the back of the pack,

and have to deal with the chop

from the rest of the
riders in front of him.

It's a washing
machine out there.


737

In conditions like this, you
have to find your rhythm,


738

and Burnett just can't
seem to find his.

Burnett steps off again!

740
00:29:31.512 --> 00:29:34.014
He has to be getting
frustrated at this point.

Oh! He miss-times it,
and goes over the bars!

Burnett is showing promise,

but his go for broke riding
style has cost him again.

and he blows by Hurt.

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:33.695
Burnett stays wide
and he gets by Hurt


796
00:32:33.728 --> 00:32:34.796
to take over the lead.

797
00:32:34.829 --> 00:32:36.196
[engine freewinding]

798
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.700
Billy, you can't keep
it pinned like that!


799
00:32:38.733 --> 00:32:40.200
[engine freewinding]

800
00:32:41.468 --> 00:32:43.337
[engine freewinding]

801
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.205
- [engine freewinding]
- Holy Toledo!


802
00:32:45.239 --> 00:32:46.440
Burnett has a comfortable lead,

803
00:32:46.473 --> 00:32:49.209
but he's still
riding like a madman.


804
00:32:49.243 --> 00:32:51.311
[engine freewinding] Somebody
better check with NASA.


805
00:32:51.345 --> 00:32:53.013
This could be a moon shot!

806
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:57.050
Billy Burnett experiencing
mechanical problems,


807
00:32:57.084 --> 00:32:58.285
getting towed in.

808
00:32:58.318 --> 00:33:01.522
No surprise there after he's
been freewinding all day long.


809
00:33:01.556 --> 00:33:04.258
This is not the way you
want to end your weekend.


810
00:33:06.728 --> 00:33:11.098
Yeah, it was disappointing
to say the least.


811
00:33:11.131 --> 00:33:12.466
The guys, they're
kind of pissed.


812
00:33:12.499 --> 00:33:14.067
They're gonna make me
help tear the motor apart


813
00:33:14.101 --> 00:33:15.469
so I can learn how it works.

814
00:33:18.272 --> 00:33:19.674
Oh, I almost forgot.

815
00:33:19.707 --> 00:33:21.475
Happy birthday, Mom.

816
00:33:21.508 --> 00:33:23.277
Did you get the flowers
that I sent you?


817
00:33:24.177 --> 00:33:25.345
[Moans]

818
00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:27.447
The flowers are
beautiful, Billy.


819
00:33:27.481 --> 00:33:28.716
Thank you so much.

820
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:29.383
Oh, your dad's here.

821
00:33:29.416 --> 00:33:30.450
Do you want to talk to him?

822
00:33:31.753 --> 00:33:32.787
I'm on a business
call, I can't.


823
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.488
Fill me in later.

824
00:33:34.521 --> 00:33:35.389
I'm sorry, honey.

825
00:33:35.422 --> 00:33:37.257
He's on a business call.

826
00:33:37.291 --> 00:33:40.562
Okay, talk to you soon, bye.

827
00:33:40.595 --> 00:33:41.428
[phone beeps]

828
00:33:43.163 --> 00:33:45.132
You two should hook up.

829
00:33:45.165 --> 00:33:47.534
Nope, I'm not dating
another racer again.


830
00:33:47.569 --> 00:33:48.736
I didn't say date.

831
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.304
I said hook up.

832
00:33:51.338 --> 00:33:52.807
You know me better than that.

833
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.441
Okay, then date him.

834
00:33:54.474 --> 00:33:55.877
Look, you know he likes you

835
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.713
and he's not like
these other animals.


836
00:33:58.746 --> 00:33:59.747
He's a good guy.

837
00:34:00.915 --> 00:34:04.184
A good guy maybe,
but not a good idea.


838
00:34:04.886 --> 00:34:07.655
Look, if you don't
date him, then I will.


839
00:34:07.689 --> 00:34:09.389
And by the time
I'm done with him,


840
00:34:09.423 --> 00:34:11.826
he'll need years of therapy.

841
00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:13.160
Excuse me gentlemen,

842
00:34:14.227 --> 00:34:14.896
would you like to
purchase a delicacy


843
00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.564
to help support our orphanage?

844
00:34:17.531 --> 00:34:18.332
[Jarid] Sure, yeah.

845
00:34:18.365 --> 00:34:19.701
- How much?
- $20.


846
00:34:20.602 --> 00:34:21.603
$20?

847
00:34:21.636 --> 00:34:22.570
$20.

848
00:34:22.604 --> 00:34:23.771
What are you buying?

849
00:34:23.805 --> 00:34:26.808
I don't know, but
it's for an orphanage.


850
00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:28.175
It's called squeella.

851
00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:30.243
It's pureed squid,
eel, and fish.


852
00:34:30.277 --> 00:34:32.512
It smells bad, but
it tastes delicious.


853
00:34:32.547 --> 00:34:34.448
Um, you said 20?

854
00:34:34.481 --> 00:34:35.449
Yeah.

855
00:34:35.482 --> 00:34:36.450
What if I...

856
00:34:36.483 --> 00:34:38.251
Just give me that, and
I'll give you all this.


857
00:34:38.285 --> 00:34:39.754
Just give me the whole
cooler, everything, okay?


858
00:34:39.787 --> 00:34:41.421
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, yeah.


859
00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:42.356
- Thank you very much.
- Mm-hmm.


860
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:43.490
- Oh, you're very welcome.
- God bless you!


861
00:34:43.523 --> 00:34:44.559
Oh, God bless you.

862
00:34:44.592 --> 00:34:45.560
Well, it's for an orphanage.

863
00:34:45.593 --> 00:34:47.327
So, you know, beneath
this bad dog exterior,


864
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:49.697
I got a really big
soft spot for the kids.


865
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:51.531
Oh, hi girls.

866
00:34:52.499 --> 00:34:53.901
How are you?

867
00:34:53.935 --> 00:34:56.638
Oh! What is that?

868
00:34:57.537 --> 00:34:59.172
- [gagging]
- Don't look at me.


869
00:34:59.974 --> 00:35:01.743
Dog bought it.

870
00:35:01.776 --> 00:35:02.543
I don't know, it's
for an orphanage.


871
00:35:02.577 --> 00:35:03.578
What are you going
to do, just...


872
00:35:06.346 --> 00:35:08.315
Hey, what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?


873
00:35:08.348 --> 00:35:08.950
You want to join us?

874
00:35:08.983 --> 00:35:10.150
You know, Jarid's buying.

875
00:35:11.218 --> 00:35:12.319
I can't, guys.

876
00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:14.187
I'm getting heat
from my camp already.


877
00:35:14.221 --> 00:35:16.824
Old Dog can take
care of your teammate.


878
00:35:16.858 --> 00:35:17.759
What do you say?

879
00:35:17.792 --> 00:35:20.193
What can I say,
problem solved, right?


880
00:35:20.227 --> 00:35:20.828
Right.

881
00:35:20.862 --> 00:35:22.664
All right, let's do this.

882
00:35:22.697 --> 00:35:26.366
Miss Summer, after you.
[cheerful mariachi music]


883
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.235
Playing hard to get, I like it.

884
00:35:30.504 --> 00:35:32.607
Ah, come on now.
That's the last one.


885
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.441
Go big or go home.

886
00:35:34.474 --> 00:35:36.476
20 bucks says you
can't do two drops.


887
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.378
Come on, two drops?

888
00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:39.781
How about I do three drops

889
00:35:39.814 --> 00:35:41.248
and loser has to
buy drinks tonight?


890
00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:43.918
That's what I'm talking
about. Let's see it.


891
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:45.452
- Deal?
- Yeah, deal.


892
00:35:45.485 --> 00:35:46.988
All right, ready for this?

893
00:35:47.021 --> 00:35:47.889
Check this out.

894
00:35:47.922 --> 00:35:50.792
One, two, three.

895
00:35:54.595 --> 00:35:55.863
[laughing]

896
00:35:55.897 --> 00:35:58.432
[coughing]

897
00:35:59.901 --> 00:36:00.968
Free drinks!

898
00:36:02.904 --> 00:36:04.605
You're disgusting.

899
00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:05.773
You know what?

900
00:36:05.807 --> 00:36:06.941
You and I, we've
gotta do something


901
00:36:06.974 --> 00:36:09.242
about this sexual tension
between us, don't you think?


902
00:36:09.276 --> 00:36:10.878
[imitates gagging] I just
puked in my mouth a little.


903
00:36:10.912 --> 00:36:12.613
I'm still down.

904
00:36:12.647 --> 00:36:13.480
On that note.

905
00:36:13.513 --> 00:36:14.816
Yes, party time.

906
00:36:15.883 --> 00:36:17.384
Let's do this.

907
00:36:17.417 --> 00:36:19.419
Don't worry. I've been
touring with guys for years.


908
00:36:19.453 --> 00:36:20.487
He's not that bad.

909
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.455
Yo, have you seen the pisser?

910
00:36:21.488 --> 00:36:23.691
I got to siphon the
python before I go out.


911
00:36:23.725 --> 00:36:24.726
You know what I'm saying?

912
00:36:24.759 --> 00:36:25.827
It's over there.

913
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.595
So helpful, I love it.

914
00:36:28.896 --> 00:36:29.997
Meet you guys out there.

915
00:36:31.032 --> 00:36:32.667
You were saying?

916
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.868
Never mind.

917
00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:35.469
[yawns] I'm tired.

918
00:36:35.502 --> 00:36:36.671
I might just call
it an early night,


919
00:36:36.704 --> 00:36:38.573
but you two should hang out.

920
00:36:42.543 --> 00:36:44.277
I'm meeting some
friends down by the lake


921
00:36:44.311 --> 00:36:45.847
for some late night fun.

922
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.681
Do you wanna go?

923
00:36:46.714 --> 00:36:47.915
Sure, yeah.

924
00:36:47.949 --> 00:36:48.983
All right.

925
00:36:55.089 --> 00:36:55.923
All right!

926
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.533
[Jarid] Whoa.

927
00:37:09.804 --> 00:37:12.807
Dude, dude, my stomach's
on fire right now.


928
00:37:14.474 --> 00:37:15.910
I blame you, man.

929
00:37:15.943 --> 00:37:17.578
Blame me?

930
00:37:17.612 --> 00:37:18.579
Why me?

931
00:37:18.613 --> 00:37:19.914
'Cause you were like,
"Do all the hot sauce.


932
00:37:19.947 --> 00:37:20.882
"Do the three drops."

933
00:37:20.915 --> 00:37:21.716
You don't think it
has anything to do with


934
00:37:21.749 --> 00:37:23.885
- the thing you just chugged?
- Mm-mm.


935
00:37:23.918 --> 00:37:25.887
No, it could be a mixture of
it, but it wouldn't happen


936
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.989
if the base of the hot sauce
wasn't there right now.


937
00:37:28.022 --> 00:37:29.023
[stomach gurgles]
Mm...


938
00:37:31.025 --> 00:37:32.059
Oh.

939
00:37:32.894 --> 00:37:33.961
Sorry, dude,
bathroom's closed.


940
00:37:33.995 --> 00:37:34.962
Aw, come on, man.

941
00:37:34.996 --> 00:37:36.429
You don't understand.

942
00:37:36.463 --> 00:37:38.900
I'm about to have like a
nuclear assplosion here.


943
00:37:38.933 --> 00:37:39.801
Someone puked.

944
00:37:39.834 --> 00:37:40.868
You've gotta come
back in 10 minutes.


945
00:37:40.902 --> 00:37:41.936
10 minutes?

946
00:37:41.969 --> 00:37:43.938
Mm-mm, this thing's gonna
be over in two minutes.


947
00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:44.572
Sorry, man.

948
00:37:44.605 --> 00:37:46.941
[sighs] [stomach gurgles]

[groaning]

950
00:37:49.043 --> 00:37:51.344
- Oh!
- Hey, this is for women!


951
00:37:51.378 --> 00:37:52.547
Yeah, well, so is this,

952
00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.016
but his neighbor's a sick ass
you want no part of, lady.


953
00:37:55.917 --> 00:37:56.751
Ugh.

954
00:37:58.418 --> 00:38:00.487
[groaning] It burns.
[splattering]


955
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.856
Oh, it burns so good.

All right Billy
hold on, don't go yet.


958

Whoa, it really cooled down.

[chuckling]

966
00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:47.001
You think I'd be
used to that by now.


967
00:38:54.175 --> 00:38:56.577
You trained with Jarid
back in the day, didn't you?


968
00:38:58.012 --> 00:38:59.914
Yeah, he started
helping me when I was 13.


969
00:39:00.982 --> 00:39:03.516
I wouldn't be where I am
today if it wasn't for him.


970
00:39:06.486 --> 00:39:07.520
[chuckles]

971
00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:10.091
And he doesn't know it,
but he was my first crush.

00:39:12.059 --> 00:39:14.527
[laughing]

973
00:39:17.064 --> 00:39:19.600
So first Jarid,
and then Richard...


974
00:39:20.902 --> 00:39:22.970
sounds like you have
a thing for champions.


975
00:39:23.905 --> 00:39:26.741
So has he shared
his secret yet?


976
00:39:28.175 --> 00:39:30.878
The Jarid "holeshot"
Harper secret.


977
00:39:30.912 --> 00:39:31.979
No.

978
00:39:33.014 --> 00:39:34.514
I mean, that's...

979
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.921
that's some... that's
some legendary stuff.


980
00:39:43.157 --> 00:39:45.993
You want to go back to the
motel and get some sweatshirts?


981
00:39:47.028 --> 00:39:48.863
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's cold.


982
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.935
All right.

983
00:39:57.504 --> 00:39:59.240
Someone planning on
getting lucky tonight?


984
00:39:59.273 --> 00:40:01.909
Dog, he put this in my hand
when... at the restaurant.


985
00:40:03.044 --> 00:40:03.878
I swear.

986
00:40:05.012 --> 00:40:06.446
God, I'm gonna kill him.

987
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.053

- Oh, oh, God!

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.021
What is that?

990
00:40:15.623 --> 00:40:17.158
- Someone die in there?
- Those bastards!


991
00:40:20.527 --> 00:40:21.629
You know what?

992
00:40:22.763 --> 00:40:23.931
Let's get out of
these wet clothes


993
00:40:23.965 --> 00:40:26.000
and put this thing to good use.

994
00:40:26.033 --> 00:40:27.201
Okay, okay, slowly.

995
00:40:27.234 --> 00:40:28.836
That's enough.

996
00:40:28.869 --> 00:40:30.503
Okay, wait just a little bit.

997
00:40:30.537 --> 00:40:33.941
[breathing heavily]
Okay, okay, go slow.

Okay, oh my God.

Okay, okay, okay...

1000

I can't do this anymore.

[moaning]
Okay, okay, okay...


1002
00:40:41.148 --> 00:40:42.383
Oh God, we're almost
there, we're almost there.

- Okay, no, no, no, no, stop!
- Come on, just a little more.

- Just a little more!
- It's getting too big!

No, no, no.

1006

That's enough! 
That's enough!

1007
00:40:48.289 --> 00:40:49.724
Okay, [retching] we're done.

1008

- We're done, we're done.
- Ooh!

Ooh!

1010
00:40:52.059 --> 00:40:53.526
Why am I holding this?

[heaving]

1012
00:40:57.999 --> 00:40:59.934
I'm not so sure about this.

1013
00:40:59.967 --> 00:41:03.237
Come on, it's gonna be
internet gold, I promise.


1014
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.773
Yeah, but I don't want
those guys mad at me.


1015
00:41:05.806 --> 00:41:07.641
I'll edit you out, all right?

1016
00:41:07.675 --> 00:41:09.076
They'll never even
know you were here.


1017
00:41:10.745 --> 00:41:12.980
They are gonna be so surprised.

1018
00:41:14.015 --> 00:41:15.082
You can say that again.

1019
00:41:17.918 --> 00:41:18.786
Whew, I better
call it a night.


1020
00:41:18.819 --> 00:41:20.755
I'm done, I can't
take anything else.


1021
00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.192
[Club DJ] Are you
ready for the number one

- [crowd cheering]
- Yeah!


1024
00:41:31.632 --> 00:41:32.800
Still heading home?

1025
00:41:32.833 --> 00:41:34.735
Nope, this'll wait.

1026
00:41:34.769 --> 00:41:36.937
Let's welcome our
first contestant tonight.

[seductive hip-hop music]

No way!

1030
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.081
Oh yeah!

1031
00:41:47.114 --> 00:41:48.182
Show us your boobs!

Oh my God, yes.

Oh yeah.

harassing me all night.

1037
00:42:06.267 --> 00:42:07.134
Time to go.

No, no, no, no.

Please, Nuke, please tell him.

Come on, please!

Oh my God.

1045

Well, we could go
with Dog right now,


1046
00:42:18.112 --> 00:42:20.114
- or we could...
- Dog who?


1047
00:42:20.147 --> 00:42:21.148
Yeah. that's what I'm saying.

Come on, so what.

Come on, not tonight, please.

Look at this girl, come on!

1052
00:42:33.828 --> 00:42:35.129
Come on, please, please, please.

1053
00:42:35.162 --> 00:42:36.097
I didn't do anything wrong.

1054
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.031
I had to go to the bathroom.

1055
00:42:37.064 --> 00:42:38.099
The guy's bathroom was closed.

1056
00:42:38.132 --> 00:42:38.966
- You're done.
- I'm done?


1057
00:42:38.999 --> 00:42:40.201
- You're done.
- Done for the night.


1058
00:42:41.769 --> 00:42:42.770
All right.

1059
00:42:43.437 --> 00:42:44.939
[laughing]

1060
00:42:44.972 --> 00:42:47.074
Hey, big guy,
how was your night?


1061
00:42:47.108 --> 00:42:49.009
I'm not emotionally at a place

1062
00:42:49.043 --> 00:42:51.045
to even talk about it right
now, Jarid. Thank you.


1063
00:42:51.078 --> 00:42:53.981
You shoulda seen me
in there, first place.


1064
00:42:54.014 --> 00:42:58.052
Oh, hey, Dog, thanks for
the drinks for the night!


1065
00:42:58.085 --> 00:43:00.154
And thank you for
cheering me on, champ.


1066
00:43:00.187 --> 00:43:03.257
Well, thank you for
throwing me your top.


1067
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.962
All right, I'm going
to go take a hot shower,


1068
00:43:07.995 --> 00:43:11.632
which is like a normal
shower, but with me in it.


1069
00:43:13.868 --> 00:43:14.902
I got nothing.

1070
00:43:14.935 --> 00:43:16.003
Hey, why don't you ask her

1071
00:43:16.036 --> 00:43:17.805
if she's dressed like a general,

1072
00:43:17.838 --> 00:43:20.207
because your privates are
standing at attention.


1073
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:22.109
- [laughing]
- Shut up Pepe-la-puke!


1074
00:43:23.911 --> 00:43:25.012
That laugh drives me nuts.

1075
00:43:31.018 --> 00:43:33.220
Well, it's official.

1076
00:43:33.254 --> 00:43:35.256
This is the worst
night of my life.


1077
00:43:35.289 --> 00:43:36.757
I mean, what else could
go wrong, you know?


1078
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:37.691
I don't know.

1079
00:43:40.094 --> 00:43:41.162
[farts] Oh!

1080
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.965
I think I just sharted my pants.

1081
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.768
[Jarid chuckles]

1082
00:43:47.801 --> 00:43:49.770
You know, my team manager
has already warned me


1083
00:43:49.803 --> 00:43:53.007
to steer clear of you, and
to stay focused on racing.


1084
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.876
Why are you so worried
about what your team thinks?


1085
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.812
Any other team would
take you in a heartbeat.


1086
00:43:58.846 --> 00:44:00.214
Yeah but if I get fired,

1087
00:44:00.247 --> 00:44:02.283
my contract says I can't
race for anyone else


1088
00:44:02.316 --> 00:44:03.484
until after this season.

1089
00:44:03.517 --> 00:44:06.086
I guess this we'll have to
keep this our little secret.


1090
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.056
[romantic music]

1091
00:44:14.195 --> 00:44:15.029
Okay.

1092
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:17.431
I don't know.

1093
00:44:18.966 --> 00:44:20.134
A part of me wants
to be with you,


1094
00:44:20.167 --> 00:44:24.305
but, a part of me knows I need
to stay focused on racing.


1095
00:44:24.338 --> 00:44:26.407
Well, let's just focus
on the parts of you


1096
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.408
that want to be with me.

[laughing]

1098
00:44:30.377 --> 00:44:33.881
They say if you have to
keep a relationship a secret,


1099
00:44:33.914 --> 00:44:35.983
then you probably
shouldn't be in it.


1100
00:44:37.117 --> 00:44:40.054
Yeah well, they also
say you should live life


1101
00:44:40.087 --> 00:44:44.024
near the edge because the
view is so much better.


1102
00:44:45.226 --> 00:44:48.462
Wow, getting deep.

1103
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.965
You sound surprised.

1104
00:44:52.233 --> 00:44:55.102
Come on, I have
so much on the line.


1105
00:44:56.470 --> 00:45:01.842
[sighs] If I clinch the women's
title before the tour ends,


1106
00:45:01.875 --> 00:45:05.112
they're gonna let me race in
the men's class in the finals.


1107
00:45:06.213 --> 00:45:07.982
I mean, I'll make history.

1108
00:45:08.015 --> 00:45:10.384
I'll be the first woman to
compete against the men.


1109
00:45:12.386 --> 00:45:15.189
Hmm, so we'll be racing
against each other.


1110
00:45:16.523 --> 00:45:20.361
Yeah, I wonder
who'll get second?


1111
00:45:20.394 --> 00:45:23.264
[laughs] I wonder
where you learned that?

[car door slams]

1114
00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:46.320
It's go time.

1115
00:45:54.295 --> 00:45:58.432
You need to take a shower
and throw those underwear away.


1116
00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:00.034
- I'm sorry, dude.
- Yeah.


1117
00:46:00.067 --> 00:46:02.102
This is the worst
night of my life.


1118
00:46:02.136 --> 00:46:03.203
I'm so uncomfortable.

1119
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:06.206
I'm probably gonna
have to drive the truck


1120
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.274
into the lake.

1121
00:46:07.308 --> 00:46:09.376
Yeah well, you might
as well throw me in there


1122
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.210
when you do it.

1123
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:18.319
[splats]
[dramatic music]


1124
00:46:22.356 --> 00:46:24.525
Well, that's just fantastic!

Get off of me!

Smell that, smell that,

1130
00:46:36.571 --> 00:46:39.073
- smell that.
- What did you eat?


1131
00:46:41.075 --> 00:46:42.476
- [groaning]
- What are you doing, Harper?


1132
00:46:42.509 --> 00:46:43.444
Get off of me!

1133
00:46:48.015 --> 00:46:49.049
Kelly?

1134
00:46:56.423 --> 00:46:57.559
That's even better!

1135
00:47:06.333 --> 00:47:07.434
[Announcer] We're
at the halfway point


1136
00:47:07.468 --> 00:47:08.902
of round six in Atlanta.

1137
00:47:08.936 --> 00:47:10.572
Richard Hurt has been
riding aggressively


1138
00:47:10.605 --> 00:47:11.673
and has lead from the start,

1139
00:47:11.706 --> 00:47:14.975
but for some reason, his
lap times have dropped off.


1140
00:47:15.008 --> 00:47:17.010
Billy Burnett has worked
his way through the pack,


1141
00:47:17.044 --> 00:47:18.278
and is now all over our leader

1142
00:47:18.312 --> 00:47:20.381
as they begin to lap the field.

1143
00:47:20.414 --> 00:47:23.050
Hurt looks over at Burnett
and leaves the door wide open.


1144
00:47:23.083 --> 00:47:26.186
Oh, there's contact and
Burnett almost goes down!


1145
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.087
Don't play into it, Billy!

1146
00:47:27.121 --> 00:47:28.288
Get away from him!

1147
00:47:28.322 --> 00:47:31.024
[Announcer] Going into the
turn and Burnett retaliates.


1148
00:47:31.058 --> 00:47:32.159
He puts the nose of his ski

1149
00:47:32.192 --> 00:47:34.094
right into the
back of Hurt's leg.


1150
00:47:35.062 --> 00:47:38.365
[Jarid] Billy, settle
down and race smart!


1151
00:47:38.399 --> 00:47:40.100
[Announcer] These
two are going at it.


1152
00:47:40.134 --> 00:47:41.502
And there's contact again.

1153
00:47:42.637 --> 00:47:43.638
And again!

1154
00:47:46.206 --> 00:47:48.175
Burnett tags him back and they
head into the backstretch.


1155
00:47:48.208 --> 00:47:50.344
Burnett and Hurt
are battling it out.


1156
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.048
Burnett goes by, but he's
carrying too much speed


1157
00:47:55.082 --> 00:47:57.251
and overshoots the turn.

1158
00:47:57.284 --> 00:47:59.052
Richard Hurt goes wide too.

1159
00:47:59.086 --> 00:48:01.723
[crashes]
Oh, Hurt takes Burnett out!


1160
00:48:01.756 --> 00:48:04.024
They're fighting in the
middle of the race course!


1161
00:48:04.057 --> 00:48:05.259
I've never seen
anything like it!


1162
00:48:05.292 --> 00:48:07.127
An official is trying
to break it up,


1163
00:48:07.161 --> 00:48:08.195
but he's having no effect.
[referee whistling]


1164
00:48:08.228 --> 00:48:10.665
The rivalry between these
two is out of control,


1165
00:48:10.698 --> 00:48:12.600
and the race director
is already on his way


1166
00:48:12.634 --> 00:48:14.001
down to the beach.

1167
00:48:14.034 --> 00:48:15.102
Trading fiberglass
is one thing,


1168
00:48:15.135 --> 00:48:16.103
but what you two
were doing out there


1169
00:48:16.136 --> 00:48:18.472
is gonna get somebody
busted up in a bad way!


1170
00:48:18.505 --> 00:48:20.107
One more incident from
either one of you,


1171
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.074
and you're off the tour!

1172
00:48:21.108 --> 00:48:22.376
Do we have an understanding?

1173
00:48:25.446 --> 00:48:27.080
What kind of
amateur crap was that!


1174
00:48:27.114 --> 00:48:29.383
You're not listening to a damn
word I'm saying out there!


1175
00:48:32.152 --> 00:48:33.487
Why do I even waist my time?

1176
00:48:37.357 --> 00:48:38.459
Come on, Billy.

1177
00:48:38.492 --> 00:48:39.326
Not good.

1178
00:48:40.294 --> 00:48:41.295
Not good at all.

1179
00:48:41.328 --> 00:48:43.130
It's not broken, okay?

1180
00:48:43.163 --> 00:48:46.768
I'm just in a lot of pain
right now, all right?


1181
00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:49.169
I should probably talk
to Dad about this.


1182
00:48:49.203 --> 00:48:50.738
Is he around?

1183
00:48:50.772 --> 00:48:52.072
He wants to talk to you.

1184
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:55.142
Hey, Billy.

1185
00:48:55.175 --> 00:48:57.010
Sounds like you had
a tough weekend.


1186
00:48:57.044 --> 00:48:59.747
Yeah, you could say that.

1187
00:49:00.748 --> 00:49:04.184
Look, dad, I know you went
to bat getting me a sponsor


1188
00:49:04.218 --> 00:49:07.054
and all, but things aren't
really going the way that I


1189
00:49:07.087 --> 00:49:08.388
thought that they would.

1190
00:49:08.422 --> 00:49:12.292
I mean, I'm pretty much in
a no-win situation here,


1191
00:49:12.326 --> 00:49:17.097
so I think I'm going to just
cut it short and come home.


1192
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:18.332
Why would you want to do that?

1193
00:49:18.365 --> 00:49:20.334
You got a successful
program going.


1194
00:49:20.367 --> 00:49:22.369
Grim Ripper's sales are up 6%,

1195
00:49:22.402 --> 00:49:24.104
and Jim Anderson
called me last week


1196
00:49:24.137 --> 00:49:25.539
to tell me how happy he is.

1197
00:49:25.573 --> 00:49:26.774
You gotta hang in there.

1198
00:49:26.808 --> 00:49:29.744
That's great,
Dad, sales are up.


1199
00:49:32.847 --> 00:49:34.081
[phone beeps]

1200
00:49:36.216 --> 00:49:39.520
Okay, we'll talk next week.

1201
00:49:40.454 --> 00:49:44.191
And um,... we love you.

1202
00:49:46.828 --> 00:49:47.662
Oh.

1203
00:49:49.731 --> 00:49:54.434
He wanted me to apologize
to Jim for not winning yet.


1204
00:50:02.242 --> 00:50:03.076
So you giving up?

1205
00:50:04.812 --> 00:50:05.613
Is this where you
give me a pep talk


1206
00:50:05.647 --> 00:50:07.682
and tell me that
winners don't quit?


1207
00:50:08.215 --> 00:50:10.552
That would be pretty hypocritical of
you, wouldn't it?


1208
00:50:12.219 --> 00:50:13.353
Were you that scared?

1209
00:50:15.522 --> 00:50:17.592
Afraid the great Jarid
Harper wouldn't win again,


1210
00:50:17.625 --> 00:50:19.126
so you quit instead, huh?

1211
00:50:21.528 --> 00:50:23.497
So what are you
running home to, huh?


1212
00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:24.766
A father who sponsored a team

1213
00:50:24.799 --> 00:50:27.100
just to get rid of his
pain-in-the-ass kid for the summer.


1214
00:50:28.235 --> 00:50:30.772
Look, I don't need this!

1215
00:50:38.178 --> 00:50:39.212
Yeah, you do.

1216
00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:43.383
So do I.

1217
00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.227
Need someone to talk to?

1218
00:50:57.565 --> 00:50:58.498
I'm a good listener.

1219
00:51:01.501 --> 00:51:03.236
I thought you
couldn't talk to me?


1220
00:51:04.672 --> 00:51:06.741
I can't, but I'm here.

1221
00:51:11.679 --> 00:51:13.146
Slumming again, Kelly?

1222
00:51:14.281 --> 00:51:15.449
We were just talking, Richard.

1223
00:51:15.482 --> 00:51:17.150
Do you mind?

1224
00:51:17.184 --> 00:51:18.218
Yeah, I do.

1225
00:51:18.251 --> 00:51:18.853
We were both told an hour
ago that the truck was...


1226
00:51:18.886 --> 00:51:19.554
I know what I was told!

1227
00:51:19.587 --> 00:51:21.889
Kelly, your duffle bag's open.

1228
00:51:21.923 --> 00:51:23.091
Your shit's not packed.

1229
00:51:23.123 --> 00:51:25.225
I swear to God, it looks like
a hand grenade went off...


1230
00:51:25.258 --> 00:51:26.193
[Kelly] I'll be
there in a minute!


1231
00:51:26.226 --> 00:51:27.127
Okay, here we go.

1232
00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.896
Hey, hey, hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.


1233
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:29.931
Not worth it.

1234
00:51:29.964 --> 00:51:30.798
Not worth it, Billy.

1235
00:51:32.366 --> 00:51:33.835
Nice try, Richard.

1236
00:51:33.868 --> 00:51:35.202
Provoke him into punching you

1237
00:51:35.235 --> 00:51:36.804
so he gets kicked off the tour?

1238
00:51:36.838 --> 00:51:38.873
You know, if you want to
continue down this road with me,


1239
00:51:38.906 --> 00:51:40.540
I'll be happy to
show you the way.


1240
00:51:46.313 --> 00:51:48.683
The truck leaves in two
minutes, with or without you.


1241
00:51:54.555 --> 00:51:55.923
Promise me you won't quit.

1242
00:52:03.564 --> 00:52:06.634
Look, Billy, I owe
you an apology, okay?


1243
00:52:07.534 --> 00:52:08.870
I shouldn't have
said what I said.


1244
00:52:11.304 --> 00:52:12.573
Well, neither should I.

1245
00:52:15.943 --> 00:52:20.247
Listen, Billy, I owe
you an apology too, man.


1246
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.917
I mean, this whole
thing was my idea.


1247
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:26.520
But you gotta to know,
regardless of how we got here,


1248
00:52:26.554 --> 00:52:27.922
we're in it to
win it, all right?


1249
00:52:29.389 --> 00:52:30.958
The monks taught
me this philosophy.


1250
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.495
The cure for everything
in life is saltwater,


1251
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:39.801
tears, sweat, and the ocean.

1252
00:52:39.834 --> 00:52:41.703
You've cried your tears.

1253
00:52:41.736 --> 00:52:43.336
You've had the ocean.

1254
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.772
Now it's time to sweat.

Look, if you pace
yourself in the surf,


1284
00:54:24.872 --> 00:54:26.908
you won't wear yourself
out and make mistakes.


1285
00:54:28.776 --> 00:54:30.510
Well, maybe if you helped
me to get the holeshot,


1286
00:54:30.545 --> 00:54:32.747
then I wouldn't have to push
so hard coming from behind.


1287
00:54:33.948 --> 00:54:35.683
What do you want,
more horsepower?


1288
00:54:36.884 --> 00:54:37.885
You know what I want.

1289
00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:41.889
You used to get the
holeshot all the time.


1290
00:54:43.624 --> 00:54:44.926
They say you had a secret.

1291
00:54:46.561 --> 00:54:49.597
Well, show me you
can do it my way first,


1292
00:54:51.065 --> 00:54:53.533
then we'll talk, deal?

1293
00:54:55.169 --> 00:54:56.003
Deal.

[Announcer] Round seven of
the Azeo Distilleries Tour,


1295
00:55:00.808 --> 00:55:03.510
and Bill Burnett is out in
front, leading Richard Hurt.


1296
00:55:03.544 --> 00:55:05.947
Hurt has tried repeatedly
to retake the lead,


1297
00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:07.915
but has not been able
to make it happen.


1298
00:55:07.949 --> 00:55:08.883
You're doing great, Billy.

1299
00:55:08.916 --> 00:55:09.917
Stay consistent.

1300
00:55:11.152 --> 00:55:13.154
[Announcer] Burnett has been
fast, smooth and consistent.


1301
00:55:13.187 --> 00:55:14.922
Let's take a look
back at the pass


1302
00:55:14.956 --> 00:55:16.657
that had the fans cheering.

1303
00:55:16.691 --> 00:55:17.992
Burnett worked his way
up through the pack


1304
00:55:18.025 --> 00:55:20.027
and remained patient,
pressuring Hurt,


1305
00:55:20.061 --> 00:55:21.128
waited for the right moment,

1306
00:55:21.162 --> 00:55:23.898
and then made this great
pass to take over the lead.


1307
00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:28.669
Hear we go, the
white flag is out!


1308
00:55:28.703 --> 00:55:29.502
The final lap!

1309
00:55:29.536 --> 00:55:30.537
Hurt turns it loose.

1310
00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:31.839
They're side by side.

1311
00:55:31.873 --> 00:55:32.773
Burnett holds him off,

1312
00:55:32.807 --> 00:55:34.876
but Hurt is trying
everything to get by.


1313
00:55:34.909 --> 00:55:36.577
He knows it's now or never.

1314
00:55:36.611 --> 00:55:38.179
Hurt squeezes by on the inside,

1315
00:55:38.212 --> 00:55:40.513
but Burnett has the
line on the next turn.


1316
00:55:41.749 --> 00:55:42.817
Hurt dives inside.

1317
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:45.953
Burnett takes it back again.

1318
00:55:45.987 --> 00:55:46.988
What a battle!

1319
00:55:48.222 --> 00:55:49.991
Into the backstretch, they're
coming up on lapped traffic.


1320
00:55:50.024 --> 00:55:51.424
Just three turns to go

1321
00:55:51.458 --> 00:55:53.728
for Billy Burnett to
take home his first win.


1322
00:55:55.997 --> 00:55:57.732
He's gonna win it!

1323
00:55:57.765 --> 00:55:58.699
[Announcer] Two turns to go.

1324
00:55:58.733 --> 00:55:59.700
Burnett gets held up
behind a lapped rider,


1325
00:55:59.734 --> 00:56:02.870
but it looks like Hurt
is far enough behind.


1326
00:56:02.904 --> 00:56:05.740
Oh! The lapped rider
broke the buoy loose.


1327
00:56:05.773 --> 00:56:06.539
Burnett misses the buoy

1328
00:56:06.574 --> 00:56:08.876
and has to go back
and pick it up.


1329
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.778
Richard Hurt inherits the win,

1330
00:56:10.811 --> 00:56:13.180
but what a phenomenal
ride from Billy Burnett.


1331
00:56:13.214 --> 00:56:14.749
That a boy Billy!

1332

That's how you use your mind.

Get out of your head

All right.

So there's only one other
person in this world


1344
00:56:38.639 --> 00:56:40.574
that I've ever shared
this secret with,

So, if you're ready, I
gonna show you the secret.

your arms, okay?

You watch the drops.

They start to fall as soon
as the band starts to move.

That's how you get the jump.

I know, I know.

1423
00:59:55.035 --> 00:59:56.070
Whoa!

1424
00:59:56.103 --> 00:59:58.072
How do you like my new shorts?

1425
00:59:58.105 --> 01:00:00.674
Wow, well you definitely
went shopping with Nuke.


1426
01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:01.642
Your grandma called me

1427
01:00:01.675 --> 01:00:03.277
and said she wanted her
shower curtain back.


1428
01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:04.411
[laughing]
Yeah!


1429
01:00:04.445 --> 01:00:05.846
Hey do not despair my friend.

1430
01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.448
I have something for you too.

1431
01:00:07.481 --> 01:00:09.250
A book on how to pick up women.

1432
01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:12.219
You know, I should write my
own book one of these days.


1433
01:00:12.253 --> 01:00:13.754
Yeah right, more
like a leaflet.


1434
01:00:13.787 --> 01:00:14.755
No, no it's true.

1435
01:00:14.788 --> 01:00:16.757
You've heard of foreplay?

1436
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:20.060
Well, I invented the
five play. [chuckles]


1437
01:00:20.094 --> 01:00:21.028
[Dog] What is that?

1438
01:00:21.061 --> 01:00:23.330
Ask your mother.
[laughing]


1439
01:00:23.364 --> 01:00:24.932
Here.

1440
01:00:24.965 --> 01:00:26.400
Oh man, it's so humid today.

1441
01:00:26.433 --> 01:00:27.368
I'm not gonna wear a wetsuit.

1442
01:00:27.401 --> 01:00:29.203
At least wear a two
mill for protection.


1443
01:00:29.236 --> 01:00:31.071
And hide my new shorts?

1444
01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:32.106
Oh, no.

1445
01:00:32.139 --> 01:00:33.741
You wouldn't want to
hide those classy things.


1446
01:00:33.774 --> 01:00:35.776
You should wear them
to the party tonight.


1447
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:37.044
[Dog] Oh yeah.

1448
01:00:37.077 --> 01:00:38.979
Wait, what's this big party
everybody keeps talking about?


1449
01:00:39.013 --> 01:00:40.881
Oh, it's an annual classic.

1450
01:00:40.915 --> 01:00:42.883
The owner of Azeo Vodka
likes to throw a big blowout


1451
01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:44.118
before we head to the finals.

1452
01:00:45.386 --> 01:00:46.854
Should we warn him about Mona,

1453
01:00:46.887 --> 01:00:49.023
or let him find out on his own?

1454
01:00:49.056 --> 01:00:50.791
Who's Mona?

1455
01:00:50.824 --> 01:00:52.026
Mona Lott.

1456
01:00:52.927 --> 01:00:54.061
Mona what?

1457
01:00:54.094 --> 01:00:55.062
Mona Lott.

1458
01:00:55.095 --> 01:00:57.932
That's her name, and
that's her reputation.


1459
01:00:57.965 --> 01:00:59.300
Her last name
used to be Little.


1460
01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:01.402
But after Nuke, it became a lot.

1461
01:01:01.435 --> 01:01:03.003
- [laughing]
- Oh my God, no, no.


1462
01:01:03.037 --> 01:01:05.072
She's just a hot cougar
who owns the club,


1463
01:01:05.105 --> 01:01:06.006
and she hosts these
parties every year


1464
01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.809
so she can scope out
the new fresh meat.


1465
01:01:08.842 --> 01:01:10.077
Be careful Billy.

1466
01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:12.046
You will be filet
mignon on her menu.


1467
01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:17.051
[upbeat rock music]

1468
01:01:18.118 --> 01:01:19.520
Nice shorts, bro.

1469
01:01:19.554 --> 01:01:20.955
They make those for men?

1470
01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.962
[Jarid] All right
Billy, get focused.


1471
01:01:27.995 --> 01:01:29.029
Here we go.

1472
01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:31.165
Show 'em your ass.

1473
01:01:31.198 --> 01:01:35.135
[motors revving]

1474
01:01:41.075 --> 01:01:42.776
[Announcer] Look at that
jump by Billy Burnett!


1475
01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.245
I haven't seen
holeshot like that


1476
01:01:44.278 --> 01:01:46.213
since the last time
Jarid Harper raced.


1477
01:01:50.818 --> 01:01:53.187
- [cheering]
- Hot damn!


1478
01:01:54.888 --> 01:01:56.423
[Announcer] Billy Burnett
flying out in front,


1479
01:01:56.457 --> 01:01:59.426
taking full advantage of the
clean water ahead of him.


1480
01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.095
Richard Hurt got a bad start

1481
01:02:01.128 --> 01:02:02.496
and is well back in the pack.

1482
01:02:06.533 --> 01:02:08.469
I like being first, boys.

1483
01:02:14.241 --> 01:02:15.843
[Announcer] Richard
Hurt is moving up.


1484
01:02:15.876 --> 01:02:17.044
He's now running in sixth.

1485
01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:25.986
Burnett catches an
edge and goes down!


1486
01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.122
He scrambles to get up
and, uh-oh, check it out,


1487
01:02:28.155 --> 01:02:29.823
we have a full moon!

1488
01:02:29.857 --> 01:02:34.862
[laughing]

1489
01:02:36.063 --> 01:02:37.931
Now it's a party.

1490
01:02:37.965 --> 01:02:40.000
[Announcer] Houston,
we have a problem.


1491
01:02:41.001 --> 01:02:43.103
Well at least he's
finally taking your advice


1492
01:02:43.137 --> 01:02:46.173
and showing them his ass.

1493
01:02:49.276 --> 01:02:51.478
[Announcer] We've noticed
Burnett's handle poll sticker


1494
01:02:51.512 --> 01:02:52.179
is losing letters.

1495
01:02:52.212 --> 01:02:54.148
We're not sure what it says now.

1496
01:02:55.449 --> 01:02:56.917
All right Billy,
white flag's out.


1497
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:57.885
Richard's coming up behind you.

1498
01:02:57.918 --> 01:02:59.554
Stay tight in the turns
and you've got this.


1499
01:03:05.359 --> 01:03:06.360
[Announcer] Check
out the sticker


1500
01:03:06.393 --> 01:03:08.262
on Burnett's handle poll now.

1501
01:03:08.295 --> 01:03:11.932
You know what they say,
everything is bigger in Texas.


1502
01:03:11.965 --> 01:03:13.400
Has your boy got a new sponsor

1503
01:03:13.434 --> 01:03:15.135
or is he just proud
of his anatomy?


1504
01:03:15.169 --> 01:03:16.303
[laughing]

1505
01:03:16.337 --> 01:03:17.171
Come on.

1506
01:03:19.039 --> 01:03:20.341
That's great.

1507
01:03:20.374 --> 01:03:22.876
[Announcer] Just a
few more turns to go.


1508
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:24.445
Billy Burnett is holding
off Richard Hurt,


1509
01:03:24.478 --> 01:03:27.281
and on his way to winning
his first national event


1510
01:03:27.314 --> 01:03:29.416
with his very own unique style.

1511
01:03:33.387 --> 01:03:34.888
There's the checkered flag!

1512
01:03:35.989 --> 01:03:36.857
Burnett has done it.

1513
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:40.227
He takes home his first win!
[cheering]


1514
01:03:43.931 --> 01:03:45.132
Yeah! Yes!

1515
01:03:46.066 --> 01:03:47.968
Yes, we dit it!

1516
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.503
[Announcer] That's the
biggest smile we've seen


1517
01:03:49.536 --> 01:03:51.673
from Jarid Harper
all season long.


1518
01:03:51.706 --> 01:03:53.641
Take a look at the
top 15 finishers,


1519
01:03:53.675 --> 01:03:56.276
as we head down to
talk to our winner.


1520
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.112
- [clapping]
- Hey, hey bring it down!


1521
01:03:58.145 --> 01:03:59.246
Bring it down!

1522
01:03:59.279 --> 01:04:00.114
Um, oh!

1523
01:04:02.015 --> 01:04:04.586
Well, as my mechanic
always says,


1524
01:04:04.619 --> 01:04:07.121
life is like a bottle of
Grim Ripper Hot Sauce.


1525
01:04:07.154 --> 01:04:10.224
What you do today can come
back to burn your ass tomorrow.


1526
01:04:10.257 --> 01:04:11.593
[grunts]
[chuckling]


1527
01:04:11.626 --> 01:04:14.928
Oh, and I also want
to bring this guy in.


1528
01:04:14.962 --> 01:04:16.530
I owe a big thanks
to Jarid Harper.


1529
01:04:16.564 --> 01:04:18.566
I mean, I wouldn't
be here without him.


1530
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.436
And this guy, he's been
like a father to me, so...


1531
01:04:23.303 --> 01:04:25.105
[Announcer] Well,
congratulations Billy.


1532
01:04:25.139 --> 01:04:28.676
I'm sure Jarid is proud of
you and your team right now.


1533
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:30.612
I know this has been
a hard fought battle


1534
01:04:30.645 --> 01:04:32.012
to get you here today.

1535
01:04:32.714 --> 01:04:33.882
Billy Burnett's win this weekend

1536
01:04:33.914 --> 01:04:37.217
now moves him into second in
points behind Richard Hurt.


1537
01:04:37.251 --> 01:04:39.687
Kelly Weber continues
her undefeated season,


1538
01:04:39.721 --> 01:04:42.456
and her win today gives her
an insurmountable points lead


1539
01:04:42.489 --> 01:04:44.324
going into the finals.

1540
01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:46.460
Congratulations.

1541
01:04:46.493 --> 01:04:47.327
[kisses]

1542
01:04:48.663 --> 01:04:50.097
Congrats to you too.

1543
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:52.099
Another championship
clinched, huh?


1544
01:04:52.132 --> 01:04:55.135
Yes, and now I'll get to race
with the men in the finals.


1545
01:04:55.169 --> 01:04:56.003
So excited.

1546
01:04:56.036 --> 01:04:58.071
Guess I better
train extra hard now.


1547
01:04:58.105 --> 01:04:59.173
Yeah, I think so.

1548
01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.341
Hey, nice ass by the way.

1549
01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:04.445
Hmm, I was just trying
to get your attention.


1550
01:05:04.478 --> 01:05:06.046
Oh, well, you got it.

1551
01:05:06.079 --> 01:05:07.114
[laughing]

1552
01:05:07.147 --> 01:05:09.183
Are you gonna go to that
the big party tonight?


1553
01:05:09.216 --> 01:05:09.884
Oh, no.

1554
01:05:09.918 --> 01:05:12.085
Uh, [sighs] they banned Richard

1555
01:05:12.119 --> 01:05:15.422
after an incident last
season, and our manager says


1556
01:05:15.456 --> 01:05:18.660
our entire team is
boycotting, politics.


1557
01:05:20.127 --> 01:05:22.362
But it's okay, we're leaving
extra early for Havasu,


1558
01:05:22.396 --> 01:05:24.431
and going straight there to
test for the finals, so...


1559
01:05:24.465 --> 01:05:27.067
Come on, come help
celebrate my first win.


1560
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.136
I wish I could, I'm sorry.

1561
01:05:31.138 --> 01:05:31.972
I have to lay low.

1562
01:05:33.173 --> 01:05:34.074
Oh, she'll be there.

1563
01:05:34.107 --> 01:05:34.742
Gotta go. Bye!

1564
01:05:36.343 --> 01:05:37.712
[chuckles]

1565
01:05:37.745 --> 01:05:38.613
Hey thanks, Jim.

1566
01:05:38.646 --> 01:05:39.413
No thank you, Doug.

1567
01:05:39.446 --> 01:05:40.347
I'm very excited.

1568
01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.015
I'm very excited about
everything, okay.


1569
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:43.183
- All right.
- I'm taking these boys out.


1570
01:05:43.217 --> 01:05:44.686
I might not bring them back.

1571
01:05:44.719 --> 01:05:46.220
All right, have fun, have fun!

1572
01:05:48.155 --> 01:05:50.792
[phone beeps]
[ringing]


1573
01:05:50.825 --> 01:05:52.326
[Billy] Hey, this is Billy.

1574
01:05:52.359 --> 01:05:56.598
Leave a message cause I
am going, going, gone!


1575
01:05:58.432 --> 01:05:59.366
[phone beeps]

1576
01:05:59.399 --> 01:06:00.802
Welcome to the party.

1577
01:06:00.835 --> 01:06:01.636
Enjoy yourselves.

1578
01:06:01.669 --> 01:06:03.537
This dog is ready
to hunt tonight!


1579
01:06:04.404 --> 01:06:06.206
Yeah, well, did you read
that book Nuke got you?


1580
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.207
Nah, I tried.

1581
01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:09.309
It was a bunch of crap
about listening to women


1582
01:06:09.343 --> 01:06:10.745
and respecting their feelings.

1583
01:06:10.778 --> 01:06:12.312
I don't know, it seems
like a lot of work.


1584
01:06:12.346 --> 01:06:13.715
Well, could you
at just least try


1585
01:06:13.748 --> 01:06:15.817
to use a little subtlety
in your approach tonight?


1586
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:17.017
Sure.

1587
01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:18.786
For you, champ, it'll be a
kinder, gentler, Dog tonight,


1588
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.120
all right?

1589
01:06:20.153 --> 01:06:20.922
[Dog] Hello.

1590
01:06:20.955 --> 01:06:22.289
Welcome to the
Azeo Vodka party.


1591
01:06:22.322 --> 01:06:23.123
Well, thank you so much.

1592
01:06:23.156 --> 01:06:25.092
That's quite a
grip you got there.


1593
01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:26.794
Yeah, I grew up
on a dairy farm,


1594
01:06:26.828 --> 01:06:29.096
and that's my tit
squeezing hand.


1595
01:06:29.129 --> 01:06:31.098
That's quite a coincidence,
'cause it's mine too.


1596
01:06:31.131 --> 01:06:33.735
[groans] Eight
seconds, wow, good job.


1597
01:06:33.768 --> 01:06:37.204
[laughing] - Amazing,
this guy's still single?


1598
01:06:37.237 --> 01:06:38.272
Hey, Ryan.

1599
01:06:38.305 --> 01:06:39.406
Thanks so much for having us.

1600
01:06:39.439 --> 01:06:42.109
Hey Billy, this is Ryan Horn,
the owner of Azeo Vodka.


1601
01:06:42.142 --> 01:06:44.478
- Ryan, this...
- I know who he is.


1602
01:06:44.511 --> 01:06:45.747
Nice ridin' today, Billy.

1603
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:48.583
And the way you gave 'ol Dick
Hurt the brown eye like that,


1604
01:06:48.616 --> 01:06:50.785
[laughing]
I nearly pissed myself.


1605
01:06:50.818 --> 01:06:52.386
Come on in, boys,
let's get after it.


1606
01:06:52.419 --> 01:06:53.320
- All right.
- Sweet.


1607
01:06:53.353 --> 01:06:55.657
[upbeat rock music]

1608
01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:58.091
Jarid Harper!

1609
01:06:58.125 --> 01:07:01.194
Mona, how you doing?

1610
01:07:01.228 --> 01:07:02.129
Even better if you tell me

1611
01:07:02.162 --> 01:07:04.231
you came back to take
me up on my offer.


1612
01:07:04.264 --> 01:07:05.567
Oh, you know, Mona,

1613
01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.134
I've been known to do
a little pinch hitting


1614
01:07:07.167 --> 01:07:09.136
for Jarid from time to time.

1615
01:07:10.237 --> 01:07:12.740
Speaking of pinch hitters,
young Billy Burnett,


1616
01:07:13.741 --> 01:07:15.610
I'm having a hall of fame
ceremony later tonight


1617
01:07:15.643 --> 01:07:17.879
and I'm confident
you'll be inducted.


1618
01:07:17.912 --> 01:07:18.813
I'll come find you.

1619
01:07:20.848 --> 01:07:22.717
[laughs]

1620
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:23.551
Run.

1621
01:07:24.484 --> 01:07:27.154
She is going to come find you.

1622
01:07:35.597 --> 01:07:37.431
Dude, why are you
doing this to yourself?


1623
01:07:37.464 --> 01:07:39.232
Let's go somewhere else.

1624
01:07:39.266 --> 01:07:40.802
I've got my reasons.

1625
01:07:47.909 --> 01:07:49.844
Look at this guy, sickening.

1626
01:07:49.877 --> 01:07:51.846
Oui, oui, I am zee
king of bullshit.


1627
01:07:51.879 --> 01:07:54.147
If you don't believe
me, just ask me.


1628
01:07:54.181 --> 01:07:55.850
I am zee best. 
What an idiot.

1629
01:07:57.184 --> 01:07:58.452
You know, we may
have to reel Billy in.


1630
01:07:58.485 --> 01:08:00.888
He's starting to
party pretty hard.


1631
01:08:00.922 --> 01:08:03.190
[shouting]

1632
01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:05.525
Don't worry, I'll
keep an eye on him.


1633
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.696
Great, I feel a
whole lot better now.


1634
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:09.664
Good, you should.

1635
01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:13.901
- Cheers.
- Cheers, gentlemen.


1636
01:08:13.935 --> 01:08:15.135
- To victory.
- To...


1637
01:08:19.272 --> 01:08:21.743
- Ugh.
- Billy, come on.


1638
01:08:21.776 --> 01:08:22.944
[laughing]

1639
01:08:22.977 --> 01:08:27.180
Oh, Billy come on. [chuckles]

1640
01:08:27.214 --> 01:08:27.849
Yo...

1641
01:08:29.917 --> 01:08:31.619
[Tina] Do you mind
if we take a picture?


1642
01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:32.452
Not at all.

1643
01:08:32.486 --> 01:08:34.254
Oh, thank you so much.

1644
01:08:34.287 --> 01:08:36.256
- Oh, of you guys?
- Yeah, please.


1645
01:08:36.289 --> 01:08:37.759
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


1646
01:08:37.792 --> 01:08:39.192
- Oh, okay.
- Sorry.


1647
01:08:39.894 --> 01:08:42.563
Say, "Doggy style."

1648
01:08:42.597 --> 01:08:43.463
Uh-uh.

1649
01:08:43.497 --> 01:08:45.232
[chuckles] You are
beautiful, honey.


1650
01:08:45.265 --> 01:08:46.734
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.


1651
01:08:46.768 --> 01:08:47.935
I am such a fan.

1652
01:08:47.969 --> 01:08:48.936
Thank you.

1653
01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:50.571
I'm a fan of yours.

1654
01:08:50.605 --> 01:08:52.272
[inhales deeply] Mm!

1655
01:08:53.941 --> 01:08:56.309
Man, this is unbelievable.

1656
01:08:56.343 --> 01:08:57.879
Billy's in the middle
of a feeding frenzy.


1657
01:08:57.912 --> 01:08:59.479
Nuke's got a net full.

1658
01:08:59.513 --> 01:09:02.282
You, you've got one on the
hook and just let one go.


1659
01:09:02.315 --> 01:09:05.352
Me, I can't even get a nibble.

1660
01:09:06.386 --> 01:09:08.690
Maybe if you were
fishing with a bigger worm?


1661
01:09:08.723 --> 01:09:10.925
[mockingly laughs]
That's hilarious.


1662
01:09:10.958 --> 01:09:11.959
Hey, what's your deal anyway?

1663
01:09:11.993 --> 01:09:14.595
I mean, you got all
those hot chicks on tour.


1664
01:09:14.629 --> 01:09:15.930
Why don't just pluck one out

1665
01:09:15.963 --> 01:09:18.432
and make her your trophy
wife or something?


1666
01:09:18.465 --> 01:09:20.968
There's more to relationships
than physical attraction.


1667
01:09:21.002 --> 01:09:22.070
Okay, yeah well,
if you leave now,


1668
01:09:22.103 --> 01:09:24.839
you can catch the Katherine
Heigl double feature.


1669
01:09:24.872 --> 01:09:26.974
[mockingly laughing]

1670
01:09:27.008 --> 01:09:27.809
No, I mean, I get it.

1671
01:09:27.842 --> 01:09:30.310
I could get on that
page, you know.


1672
01:09:30.343 --> 01:09:31.411
That's what I'm looking
for here tonight,


1673
01:09:31.445 --> 01:09:34.247
just like a deep meaningless
relationship, you know?


1674
01:09:34.281 --> 01:09:36.851
No, no, all right,
seriously, seriously,


1675
01:09:36.884 --> 01:09:39.419
seriously, I get where
you're coming from.


1676
01:09:39.453 --> 01:09:42.957
I would just give anything
to like find a special girl


1677
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:46.728
to just you know, love,
confide in, to cherish,


1678
01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:50.998
and just like respect
everything, just


1679
01:09:51.032 --> 01:09:53.968
Oh my God, look at the
taters on this little model.


1680
01:10:04.812 --> 01:10:06.547
[giggling]

1681
01:10:07.582 --> 01:10:08.950
I'm so sick of this crap.

1682
01:10:11.886 --> 01:10:13.320
Let's go.

1683
01:10:13.353 --> 01:10:16.758
[electronic dance music]

1684
01:10:54.562 --> 01:10:56.396
There's the man of the hour.

1685
01:10:56.429 --> 01:10:57.430
[nervous chuckle]

1686
01:10:57.464 --> 01:11:00.067
You haven't had your
Mona Lott shot, have you?


1687
01:11:00.101 --> 01:11:01.903
Um...

1688
01:11:01.936 --> 01:11:04.371
Open wide, I'm coming
in. [whipped cream sprays]


1689
01:11:04.404 --> 01:11:06.439
Oops, let me get that.

1690
01:11:11.646 --> 01:11:12.479
[groaning]

1691
01:11:19.086 --> 01:11:19.921
Kelly?

1692
01:11:22.056 --> 01:11:23.991
No, no, Kelly!

1693
01:11:24.025 --> 01:11:24.959
Dude, you're losing it.

1694
01:11:24.992 --> 01:11:25.993
She's not even worth it.

1695
01:11:26.027 --> 01:11:27.929
I'm not losing anything!

1696
01:11:27.962 --> 01:11:29.897
Yeah well, we
could lose our jobs.


1697
01:11:29.931 --> 01:11:31.899
Are you with me or against me?

1698
01:11:33.433 --> 01:11:34.401
All right.

1699
01:11:34.434 --> 01:11:35.570
Yeah, let's do it.

1700
01:11:36.436 --> 01:11:37.404
All right, cool.

1701
01:11:46.013 --> 01:11:47.915
[Billy] Kelly, Kelly!

1702
01:11:48.916 --> 01:11:51.085
Congratulations on getting
in Mona's hall of fame.


1703
01:11:51.118 --> 01:11:53.554
- I was...
- Just go, I've got this.


1704
01:11:53.588 --> 01:11:55.022
I wasn't kissing her.

1705
01:11:55.056 --> 01:11:57.692
I thought you were different
from the rest of these guys!


1706
01:11:57.725 --> 01:11:59.594
She was crazy about you!

1707
01:11:59.627 --> 01:12:01.662
She was the best thing
that's ever happened to you,


1708
01:12:01.696 --> 01:12:02.930
and you just threw it away!

1709
01:12:04.065 --> 01:12:05.800
Look, stay away from my friends!

1710
01:12:07.101 --> 01:12:08.535
I wasn't kissing...

1711
01:12:10.571 --> 01:12:13.107
[breathing heavily]

1712
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.942
Hey, Billy, your
ski's on fire!


1713
01:12:14.976 --> 01:12:16.010
What?

1714
01:12:16.043 --> 01:12:19.881
[dramatic music]

1715
01:12:19.914 --> 01:12:20.748
My ski.

1716
01:12:25.219 --> 01:12:27.588
[rattles fence]
[grunts]


1717
01:12:36.731 --> 01:12:37.565
[slams fence]

1718
01:12:42.803 --> 01:12:44.639
[phone vibrates]
[beeps]


1719
01:12:44.672 --> 01:12:45.706
Hey, Jim.

1720
01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:48.142
Hey, bud, I just wanted
to call and let you know


1721
01:12:48.175 --> 01:12:50.912
I won't be able to wire
you that next payment.


1722
01:12:52.113 --> 01:12:53.014
What's going on?

1723
01:12:54.081 --> 01:12:57.018
Um, I'm going on vacation.

1724
01:12:57.952 --> 01:12:59.687
Vacation?

1725
01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.658
Sausage was discovered in
the sauce. [nervously laughs]


1726
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:07.028
Sausage, I don't understand,
why is that a problem?


1727
01:13:07.962 --> 01:13:11.065
I mean, you're not advertising
it's kosher are you?


1728
01:13:11.098 --> 01:13:12.900
It wasn't kosher with my wife.

1729
01:13:12.934 --> 01:13:14.969
It was my sausage in
my secretary's sauce.


1730
01:13:15.002 --> 01:13:16.604
She's pissed.

1731
01:13:16.637 --> 01:13:18.606
She turned my books
over to the IRS.


1732
01:13:18.639 --> 01:13:20.574
The FBI is here now
seizing everything.


1733
01:13:20.608 --> 01:13:23.744
Oh God, I'm gonna

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.500
That would've been epic.

1893
01:22:06.533 --> 01:22:09.236
Oh okay, Dog,
Team Burnett it is.


1894
01:22:09.269 --> 01:22:12.506
Your dad sold his car so you
can go to the championships.


1895
01:22:14.141 --> 01:22:15.175
Dad, that was your, your...

1896
01:22:15.209 --> 01:22:16.043
My baby.

1897
01:22:17.244 --> 01:22:19.446
I sold it for you, man.

1898
01:22:24.251 --> 01:22:25.687
I can't believe
you would do that.


1899
01:22:28.623 --> 01:22:30.324
Well, are we going to stand
around here yapping about it,


1900
01:22:30.357 --> 01:22:32.426
or are we going to go racing?

1901
01:22:33.661 --> 01:22:34.662
Everybody in here.

1902
01:22:34.696 --> 01:22:36.163
On three, Team Burnett.

1903
01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:41.068
This is gonna be
the greatest comeback


1904
01:22:41.101 --> 01:22:43.136
in Team Burnett history.

1905
01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:44.171
One, two, three.

1906
01:22:44.204 --> 01:22:45.239
[All] Team Burnett!

1907

The first woman to
compete against the men


1911
01:23:12.366 --> 01:23:13.300
at world finals.

1912
01:23:13.333 --> 01:23:15.435
What are you feeling right now?

1913
01:23:15.469 --> 01:23:17.070
So many things.

1914
01:23:17.104 --> 01:23:18.138
It's quite amazing.

1915
01:23:18.171 --> 01:23:21.441
A lot of dreams are coming
true today, so it's big.


1916
01:23:21.475 --> 01:23:23.243
That's what she
said. [chuckles]

[cheering]

1918
01:23:25.547 --> 01:23:26.848
I've been to the top of this
mountain four times already.


1919
01:23:26.881 --> 01:23:27.782
I've got the points lead,

1920
01:23:27.815 --> 01:23:29.149
and I only need to
finish 10th or better


1921
01:23:29.182 --> 01:23:30.117
to take home the championship.

1922
01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:32.286
So, would you bet against me?

1923
01:23:35.389 --> 01:23:37.559
My mechanic, he's been
up for three days straight


1924
01:23:37.592 --> 01:23:38.660
building my new ski.

1925
01:23:39.827 --> 01:23:42.129
My entire team has been amazing.

1926
01:23:43.397 --> 01:23:44.197
My message to the competition

1927
01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:46.133
is to nut up and
put the wood to it.


1928
01:23:46.166 --> 01:23:47.100
Let's get it on.

1929
01:23:47.134 --> 01:23:47.835
May the best man win.

1930
01:23:50.772 --> 01:23:53.875
Kelly, I've been trying
to call you for weeks.


1931
01:23:53.908 --> 01:23:55.810
Look, I promise you I
didn't do anything, I...


1932
01:23:55.843 --> 01:23:58.445
Let's just focus on what's
important today, okay?


1933
01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.214
[sighs]

1934
01:24:03.918 --> 01:24:05.787
[Announcer] You can feel
the electricity in the air


1935
01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:06.788
and the stage is set.

1936
01:24:06.821 --> 01:24:09.222
Billy Burnett's team has
burned the midnight oil


1937
01:24:09.256 --> 01:24:13.226
putting together a new Pro
Force 2.0, but it's untested.


1938
01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.362
And rumor has it that
Broward Motorsports


1939
01:24:15.395 --> 01:24:18.733
has upgraded Richard Hurt's
ski with 20 more horsepower


1940
01:24:18.766 --> 01:24:20.602
than he's had all season long.

1941
01:24:20.635 --> 01:24:22.870
It's going to be interesting.

1942
01:24:22.904 --> 01:24:23.938
So how you holding up, pal?

1943
01:24:23.972 --> 01:24:27.709
Oh man, I am running
on fumes, but we made it.


1944
01:24:29.343 --> 01:24:30.778
Yeah, well, you'll
sleep good tonight, huh?


1945
01:24:30.812 --> 01:24:31.913
Mm-hm.

1946
01:24:31.946 --> 01:24:33.180
You got this.

1947
01:24:38.886 --> 01:24:39.854
What's on your mind, Billy?

1948
01:24:40.788 --> 01:24:42.824
How are we gonna
compete against Richard


1949
01:24:42.857 --> 01:24:44.826
when he's running on

1950
01:24:46.526 --> 01:24:47.629
Even if he does
get the holeshot,


1951
01:24:47.662 --> 01:24:48.630
it's not gonna matter.

1952
01:24:48.663 --> 01:24:51.733
Once it gets rough out
there, it's all rider.


1953
01:24:51.766 --> 01:24:52.767
You can outride him.

1954
01:24:54.401 --> 01:24:56.536
Just go out there
and show them your ass.

get into the race,

championship is long gone.

now in second place

pressure on Kelly Weber,

Hurt gets by.

Weber dives back inside
and retakes the lead!

tougher than a $2 steak,

right into the buoy.

his own teammate!

And the crowd can't
believe what just happened.

Billy Burnett has caught
the back of the pack


2035
01:28:40.795 --> 01:28:42.529
and is starting to
pick riders off.


2036
01:28:47.034 --> 01:28:48.803
And attrition begins
to take it's toll,

01:28:48.836 --> 01:28:51.404
as riders are dropping out
with mechanical problems.

Kelly Weber has
remounted her ski.

She signals she's okay,

2040

but she no doubt had her
bell rung on that get off.

Back on our leader Richard Hurt,

out in front and he's
absolutely flying.

battle his way through the pack.

01:29:29.877 --> 01:29:31.746
and Richard Hurt still
has a commanding lead


2048
01:29:31.779 --> 01:29:32.980
over the rest of the field.

2049
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:36.584
How we looking?

2050
01:29:36.617 --> 01:29:37.852
Well, Richard's slowing down.

2051
01:29:37.885 --> 01:29:39.987
He's probably saving his motor.

2052
01:29:40.021 --> 01:29:42.890
We're gaining, but it's
not going to be enough.


2053
01:29:42.924 --> 01:29:44.058
We're gonna need a miracle.

2054
01:29:45.259 --> 01:29:46.093
You smell that?

2055
01:29:47.128 --> 01:29:47.962
Smell what?

2056
01:29:49.130 --> 01:29:50.831
A miracle.

2057
01:29:50.865 --> 01:29:51.832
Richard just went by.

2058
01:29:51.866 --> 01:29:54.001
I smell burning rubber.

2059
01:29:54.035 --> 01:29:56.203
He's not slowing down
to save his engine.


2060
01:29:56.237 --> 01:29:58.039
He's burning an exhaust hose.

2061
01:29:58.973 --> 01:30:01.909
[motors buzzing]

2062
01:30:01.943 --> 01:30:03.010
Billy, listen.

2063
01:30:03.044 --> 01:30:04.979
You're running a great race
just like we practiced,


2064
01:30:05.012 --> 01:30:06.914
but we're changing plans.

2065
01:30:06.948 --> 01:30:08.616
I want you to ride
like the old Billy.


2066
01:30:08.649 --> 01:30:09.717
Pin it to win it, baby.

2067
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:10.751
Pin it to win it!

2068
01:30:12.753 --> 01:30:14.188
[Announcer] Burnett has
turned on the afterburners


2069
01:30:14.221 --> 01:30:16.157
and is on the ragged edge.

2070
01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:18.125
He's blowing by
riders, left and right.


2071
01:30:19.193 --> 01:30:21.494
He cuts off a rider
just before the log jump


2072
01:30:21.528 --> 01:30:23.564
and sends him into it!
[crowd gasping]


2073
01:30:23.597 --> 01:30:25.066
[cheering]
The crowd is loving it,


2074
01:30:25.099 --> 01:30:27.601
as Billy Burnett has
pulled out all the stops.


2075
01:30:40.982 --> 01:30:41.916
You think that helps?

2076
01:30:41.949 --> 01:30:43.651
Yes.
[laughing]


2077
01:30:47.188 --> 01:30:48.488
[laughing]

2078
01:30:51.759 --> 01:30:53.294
[Announcer] Burnett is flying!

2079
01:30:53.327 --> 01:30:56.197
He's in third place, and
is reeling in second!


2080
01:30:56.230 --> 01:31:00.901
[crowd clamoring]

2081
01:31:00.935 --> 01:31:03.037
We've gotta get
closer, come on.


2082
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:04.705
[Announcer] Richard
Hurt remains in front,


2083
01:31:04.739 --> 01:31:07.975
but his lead has dropped
to just four seconds.


2084
01:31:08.009 --> 01:31:09.210
At this point, I'm
sure he's aware


2085
01:31:09.243 --> 01:31:11.145
that Burnett is coming up quick.

2086
01:31:20.988 --> 01:31:23.290
Burnett gets by Kole
Cramer for second!


2087
01:31:23.324 --> 01:31:24.625
[cheering]

2088
01:31:24.658 --> 01:31:25.793
That's what I'm talking about!

2089
01:31:25.826 --> 01:31:26.861
Bump it right there!

2090
01:31:26.894 --> 01:31:27.527
B-burn now!

2091
01:31:28.929 --> 01:31:30.031
Okay, Billy, here's the plan.

2092
01:31:30.064 --> 01:31:32.199
Do not pass Richard.

2093
01:31:32.233 --> 01:31:32.833
[Billy] What?

2094
01:31:32.867 --> 01:31:34.168
What kind of plan is that?

2095
01:31:34.201 --> 01:31:35.336
What kind of plan is that?

2096
01:31:35.369 --> 01:31:36.337
Just trust me on this.

2097
01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:38.572
Push him as hard as you
can without passing him.


2098
01:31:40.041 --> 01:31:40.975
[Announcer] Richard
Hurt in front,


2099
01:31:41.008 --> 01:31:43.277
but Billy Burnett is
rapidly closing the gap!


2100
01:31:47.314 --> 01:31:49.050
Burnett takes the inside line!

2101
01:31:51.085 --> 01:31:52.353
He tries again!

2102
01:31:52.386 --> 01:31:54.021
They're side by side!

2103
01:31:54.055 --> 01:31:55.723
The crowd is going crazy!

2104
01:31:55.756 --> 01:31:58.125
[cheering]

2105
01:31:58.159 --> 01:32:00.027
Richard Hurt is doing
everything he can


2106
01:32:00.061 --> 01:32:01.162
to hold onto his lead,

2107
01:32:01.195 --> 01:32:03.998
but Burnett is on him like
a dog on a piece of meat.


2108
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:08.035
[Sam] Richard, be smart.

2109
01:32:08.069 --> 01:32:09.637
You don't need to win this.

2110
01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:11.105
[Richard] There's no
way he's beating me!


2111
01:32:12.173 --> 01:32:13.941
[Announcer] The
white flag comes out.


2112
01:32:13.974 --> 01:32:15.810
One lap to go!

2113
01:32:15.843 --> 01:32:16.777
Come on.

2114
01:32:16.811 --> 01:32:19.046
Burn, you son of a gun, burn.

2115
01:32:24.118 --> 01:32:28.055
All right, Billy,
take us home.


2116
01:32:28.089 --> 01:32:29.757
[Announcer]
Burnett sets him up.


2117
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:30.758
He dives inside,

2118
01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:32.760
trying to get the drive
down the backstretch.


2119
01:32:32.793 --> 01:32:34.195
And Burnett goes by!

2120
01:32:34.228 --> 01:32:35.796
Richard Hurt is slowing.

2121
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:36.831
He's got a problem.

2122
01:32:36.864 --> 01:32:37.832
His ski has died.

2123
01:32:37.865 --> 01:32:38.999
Hurt is down!

2124
01:32:39.033 --> 01:32:42.036
Hurt is down!
[cheering]


2125
01:32:43.104 --> 01:32:45.206
[Announcer] Billy
Burnett is going to do it.


2126
01:32:45.239 --> 01:32:47.741
From dead last to first,

2127
01:32:47.775 --> 01:32:50.077
what an amazing ride
for this young man.


2128
01:32:50.111 --> 01:32:53.080
Here it is, the checkered flag!

2129
01:32:53.114 --> 01:32:55.749
Billy Burnett has overcome
an incredible setback


2130
01:32:55.783 --> 01:32:57.852
on the start and done it.

2131
01:32:57.885 --> 01:32:58.919
He has won the battle,

2132
01:32:58.953 --> 01:33:01.689
but it looks like Richard
Hurt will win the war.


2133
01:33:01.722 --> 01:33:04.125
He's up and running and
going to nurse it home


2134
01:33:04.158 --> 01:33:05.926
for at least a

2135
01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:09.196
Whoa, what's that all about?

2136
01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:10.931
If Richard finishes
in the top 10,


2137
01:33:10.965 --> 01:33:12.066
he wins the championship.

2138
01:33:12.099 --> 01:33:13.901
What's that?
What's that? What?


2139
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:17.071
I'm gonna go
grab the ski, okay?


2140
01:33:18.339 --> 01:33:21.108
[Announcer] Hurt's ski dies
again and he drops to fourth.


2141
01:33:22.176 --> 01:33:25.713
He gets it re-lit, but it's
not firing on all cylinders.


2142
01:33:25.746 --> 01:33:28.149
Two more riders go by,
dropping Hurt to sixth,


2143
01:33:28.182 --> 01:33:29.984
and the crowd has
picked up on it,


2144
01:33:30.017 --> 01:33:31.852
as he continues
to drop positions.


2145
01:33:32.786 --> 01:33:33.787
[Group] Seventh!

2146
01:33:36.924 --> 01:33:38.392
[Announcer] Hurt is limping
toward the finish line


2147
01:33:38.425 --> 01:33:40.861
30 feet away and
his ski dies again!


2148
01:33:40.895 --> 01:33:41.563
He's down!

2149
01:33:41.596 --> 01:33:43.197
He's down in the water again!

2150
01:33:43.230 --> 01:33:44.798
Here comes another rider.

2151
01:33:45.966 --> 01:33:46.901
[Team Burnett] Eighth!

2152
01:33:46.934 --> 01:33:49.069
[Announcer] Hurt's
ski is completely dead.


2153
01:33:49.103 --> 01:33:51.972
He's trying to swim it
across the finish line.


2154
01:33:52.006 --> 01:33:54.074
He looks back, and here
comes another rider.


2155
01:33:54.108 --> 01:33:56.110
He'll drop down to ninth.

2156
01:33:56.143 --> 01:33:57.344
Ninth!

2157
01:33:57.378 --> 01:34:00.214
[Announcer] Hurt is a mere

2158
01:34:00.247 --> 01:34:01.148
Here comes another rider

2159
01:34:01.182 --> 01:34:03.951
putting him on the
bubble in 10th place.


2160
01:34:03.984 --> 01:34:04.985
[Team Burnett] 10th!

2161
01:34:05.019 --> 01:34:05.986
[Announcer] He
could lose it all!


2162
01:34:07.054 --> 01:34:08.055
Hurt looks exhausted.

2163
01:34:08.088 --> 01:34:09.156
Here comes another rider,

2164
01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:11.959
and it's his
teammate Kelly Weber!


2165
01:34:11.992 --> 01:34:13.994
[Sam] Kelly, do
not pass Richard!


2166
01:34:14.028 --> 01:34:15.429
Do you understand?

2167
01:34:15.462 --> 01:34:16.764
Do not pass Richard!

2168
01:34:17.965 --> 01:34:20.201
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...

2169
01:34:21.368 --> 01:34:24.071
[Announcer] Kelly
Weber is slowing down.


2170
01:34:24.104 --> 01:34:26.106
She's stopping
behind Richard Hurt.


2171
01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.777
And look at this, there's no
one else left on the course!


2172
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:31.879
Richard Hurt is gonna
win the championship


2173
01:34:31.912 --> 01:34:33.447
by the skin of his teeth.

2174
01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:35.849
Billy Burnett rode the
race of a lifetime,


2175
01:34:35.883 --> 01:34:38.752
but the championship wasn't
in the cards for him today.


2176
01:34:38.786 --> 01:34:39.420
[Sam] That's perfect, Kelly.

2177
01:34:39.453 --> 01:34:41.021
Great job. Just sit tight.

2178
01:34:44.091 --> 01:34:45.125
Come on, Kelly.

2179
01:34:45.159 --> 01:34:45.993
Come on, come on, come on.

2180
01:34:49.263 --> 01:34:51.265
[Announcer] Richard
Hurt is just 15 feet


2181
01:34:51.298 --> 01:34:52.833
away from victory!

2182
01:34:52.866 --> 01:34:54.935
[Sam] Kelly, great
teamwork out there.


2183
01:34:54.969 --> 01:34:55.869
Do you read me?

2184
01:34:56.571 --> 01:34:58.405
Kelly, do you read me?

2185
01:34:58.439 --> 01:34:59.273
Kelly?

2186
01:35:03.377 --> 01:35:04.011
Come on, Kelly.

2187
01:35:06.113 --> 01:35:07.214
You know what to do. Come on.

2188
01:35:10.117 --> 01:35:11.785
Come on.

2189
01:35:11.819 --> 01:35:13.821
Do it for love, baby.

2190
01:35:13.854 --> 01:35:15.522
[Announcer] Richard
Hurt is just 10 feet away


2191
01:35:15.557 --> 01:35:17.124
from making history.

2192
01:35:17.157 --> 01:35:18.892
Kelly, using team strategy

2193
01:35:18.926 --> 01:35:21.895
to allow Richard Hurt to
take home the championship.


2194
01:35:21.929 --> 01:35:23.831
But wait, Kelly
Weber goes for it!


2195
01:35:23.864 --> 01:35:25.799
She drops Richard
Hurt to 11th place!


2196
01:35:25.833 --> 01:35:27.034
[cheering]
I don't believe this!


2197
01:35:27.067 --> 01:35:28.869
11th, yeah!

2198
01:35:28.902 --> 01:35:30.337
[Announcer] Billy Burnett
wins the championship!


2199
01:35:30.371 --> 01:35:31.839
He wins the championship!

2200
01:35:31.872 --> 01:35:36.877
[triumphant music]
[crowd cheering]


2201
01:35:46.053 --> 01:35:48.122
I guess I do have a
thing for champions.


2202
01:35:52.159 --> 01:35:54.428
[laughing]

2203
01:36:00.534 --> 01:36:01.502
You did it!

2204
01:36:03.037 --> 01:36:04.138
This is my son!

2205
01:36:04.171 --> 01:36:07.007
This is my son!
[cheering]


2206
01:36:33.133 --> 01:36:34.101
This is your son.

2207
01:36:38.272 --> 01:36:39.973
I'm so proud of you, man.

2208
01:36:40.007 --> 01:36:41.609
Coach come here, man.

2209
01:36:41.643 --> 01:36:42.476
Come here.

2210
01:36:44.612 --> 01:36:48.916
Team Burnett, baby! Team
Burnett! Team Burnett!


2211
01:36:48.949 --> 01:36:49.584
Woo!

2212
01:36:51.352 --> 01:36:53.387
Don't think you're getting
out of here unscathed.


2213
01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.489
Come on, what did I do now?

2214
01:36:55.522 --> 01:36:58.092
I hear you're the
reason got Billy here.


2215
01:36:58.125 --> 01:36:59.493
You done good.

2216
01:36:59.526 --> 01:37:00.928
No, you're nuts.

2217
01:37:00.961 --> 01:37:02.096
I'm not falling for
whatever you're up to.


2218
01:37:02.129 --> 01:37:03.297
You need help.

2219
01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:04.932
You're the one
that's gonna need help.


2220

[kisses]

2221
01:37:08.068 --> 01:37:09.203
Yeah?

2222
01:37:09.236 --> 01:37:10.070
Yeah.

2223
01:37:14.141 --> 01:37:16.110
Sam, take a look at this.

2224
01:37:16.143 --> 01:37:17.077
She was taking pictures

2225
01:37:17.111 --> 01:37:19.079
during the starting
line National Anthem.


2226
01:37:19.113 --> 01:37:21.181
Looks like Richard was
a little distracted.


2227
01:37:21.215 --> 01:37:22.916
Are you kidding me?

2228
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:24.084
Seriously, Richard?

2229
01:37:24.118 --> 01:37:25.486
You're suspending for a year.

2230
01:37:26.353 --> 01:37:27.354
This is Broward Motorsports.

2231
01:37:27.388 --> 01:37:28.422
We don't cheat.

2232
01:37:28.455 --> 01:37:30.257
You're fired, go find
yourself another sponsor.

[Director] Jarid,
do you have the line,


2249
01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:51.138
or do you want me to feed you?

2250
01:38:51.171 --> 01:38:52.172
I got this.

2251
01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:53.006
[Director] All right.

2252
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:53.908
Shoot.

2253
01:38:53.942 --> 01:38:54.909
[Director] That's
what I like to hear.


2254
01:38:54.943 --> 01:38:58.011
- And action.
- All right, be heads up now.


2255
01:38:58.045 --> 01:39:00.047
Jarid's gonna be out for blood.

2256
01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.381
Show 'em your ass.

2257
01:39:01.415 --> 01:39:02.617
[Director] Richard's
gonna be out for blood.


2258
01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:04.418
- Yep, not me.
- Not you.


2259
01:39:05.653 --> 01:39:09.523
See, I got this.
[laughing]

01:39:11.793 --> 01:39:13.026
How are we looking?

2261
01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.161
Well, Richard's slowing down.

2262
01:39:14.194 --> 01:39:15.563
He's probably saving his motor.

2263
01:39:17.097 --> 01:39:18.131
Shit.

2264
01:39:19.099 --> 01:39:20.367
You want to try that again?

2265
01:39:22.302 --> 01:39:22.937
Sorry.

2266
01:39:24.772 --> 01:39:26.039
Did you want to say something?

2267
01:39:27.842 --> 01:39:31.111
Hey Billy, what'd you
want from Burger King?


2268
01:39:31.144 --> 01:39:33.046
All right, so listen, I
tried that five play thing


2269
01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.481
and I can't quite get the thumb.

2270

- I need something.
- Dog, dog...


2271
01:39:36.116 --> 01:39:37.150
Give me something.

2272
01:39:37.184 --> 01:39:39.119
Dog, you're not supposed
to try it on yourself.


2273
01:39:39.152 --> 01:39:40.053
Oh, okay.

2274
01:39:40.087 --> 01:39:40.822
You're supposed to
meet a woman first.


2275
01:39:40.855 --> 01:39:41.623
Very funny.

2276

Hey, I tell you
a secret, okay?


2278
01:39:44.324 --> 01:39:45.827
Do not tell anyone.

2279
01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:46.694
All right.

2280
01:39:48.161 --> 01:39:49.062
I'm not French.

2281
01:39:51.198 --> 01:39:53.066
Wait, wait, wait.

2282
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.134
Are you serious?

Maybe not. [French laughing]
