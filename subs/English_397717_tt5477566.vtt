It was such a pleasant surprise

I am glad
that you are making a fresh start.

There is an old saying

that there are things
a man can only learn in a city.


8
00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:08.256
I have found this to be true.
But do not be distracted, my son.


9
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:15.264
Focus on your studies. Your goals.
We will discuss both when you visit.

[professor] "Justice is nothing else
than the interest of the stronger."


94
00:09:27.588 --> 00:09:30.299
Now, we all know
the Greeks loved symbols, right?


95
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.802
They have since antiquity.

96
00:09:32.886 --> 00:09:37.222
So what, then, was the great symbol
of democracy in Plato's time?


97
00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:41.435
Uh, yes. Um... Barry.

98
00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:52.446
That's correct. The raised hand.
One man, one vote. All of it very public.


99
00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:55.950
But when you imagine those raised hands,
class, you have to remember,


100
00:09:56.034 --> 00:09:57.952
every one of them held a spear.

101
00:09:58.535 --> 00:10:00.371
That's what "majority rule" meant.

102
00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:01.580
So that begs the question,

103
00:10:01.665 --> 00:10:06.168
is governmental rule always supported
by the threat of violence?


104
00:10:07.294 --> 00:10:09.338
-[professor] Yes, Thad?
-It has to be.


105
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:12.676
-Otherwise, what authority would it have?
-But, what about the will of the people?


106
00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:15.970
-Sure. The people with the most spears.
-[Barry] But there's more to it than that.


107
00:10:16.054 --> 00:10:21.225
I mean, we sacrifice some of our,
um, independence to a government


108
00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:22.811
in return for security.

109
00:10:22.894 --> 00:10:24.353
And a kind of collective wisdom.

110
00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:26.147
Security's just another word
for "the most spears."


111
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.481
Every time there was a vote,

112
00:10:27.564 --> 00:10:31.527
the minority didn't count up the spears
and, uh, decide not to revolt.


113
00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:34.114
Once you make the deal
to have a government,


114
00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:36.700
that government takes on
another kind of authority.


115
00:10:36.783 --> 00:10:38.827
What, like a moral authority?

116
00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:41.620
-Well--
-So Ronald Reagan has moral authority?


117
00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:44.081
Of course he does!
He was elected in a landslide!


118
00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:46.710
Okay, if there's one thing
Ronald Reagan definitely does not have,


119
00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:47.836
it's moral authority.

120
00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:50.295
-Sure has a great head of hair, though.
-[students chuckle]


121
00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:52.173
[professor] Sorry, just kidding. Continue.

122
00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:53.674
[Barry] Let me put it like this--

123
00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:57.177
if the states had voted on slavery,
we would have lost the vote.


124
00:10:57.261 --> 00:10:58.512
So, yeah,

125
00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:02.599
at that point, moral authority kicks in
to, uh, defend the minority


126
00:11:02.683 --> 00:11:04.435
against the will of the people.

127
00:11:04.853 --> 00:11:06.020
And that's when the spears come out.

128
00:11:06.104 --> 00:11:08.564

Barry.

130
00:11:11.483 --> 00:11:13.360
Yeah, he did. And he's right.

131
00:11:14.988 --> 00:11:17.489
Seriously? The guy
who hugged Yasser Arafat is right?

with the other.

[Thad] Can I ask a question, though?

135
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:28.125
Why's everything
always gotta be about slavery?

00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:42.533

158
00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:44.994
[groans]

159
00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:47.997
-What are you doing here?
-[groans]


160
00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:51.750
This whole university experience
has changed my life, bro.


161
00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:53.335
You're a bartender, Saleem.

162
00:12:55.922 --> 00:12:58.423
So, what brings you to the West Side?

163
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:05.265
Last night at the West End,
I met this beautiful bird.


164
00:13:05.347 --> 00:13:08.226
Sociology student from Minnesota.

165

Porcelain features, tits out to here.
[chuckles]


166
00:13:13.772 --> 00:13:16.317
I mean, we wandered the city all night...

167
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.695
But when the time came, I was unable
to gain entrance to her dormitory.


168
00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:20.487
Uh, so to speak.

169
00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:22.447
So to speak.

170
00:13:23.115 --> 00:13:26.410
So I stopped at the establishment
on the corner for a morning beer,


171
00:13:26.493 --> 00:13:28.955
after which I decided to pop up here
for a smoke.


172
00:13:29.038 --> 00:13:32.208
And to borrow some cab fare home,
if possible?


173
00:13:32.292 --> 00:13:36.129
You know, this, this might sound crazy,
but just bear with me.


174
00:13:36.212 --> 00:13:39.464
Do you think there
might be some kind of, uh, correlation


175
00:13:39.548 --> 00:13:42.801
between your constantly buying alcohol
and, uh, cocaine


176
00:13:42.886 --> 00:13:45.179
and the fact that you're always broke?

177
00:13:45.262 --> 00:13:46.221
[clicks tongue]

178
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.310
It's an interesting theory,
but I just don't see it.


179
00:13:50.893 --> 00:13:52.311
Speaking of booze and blow,

180
00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:56.565
my friend, Daphne,
is having a party tonight. Ah!


181
00:13:56.648 --> 00:14:01.612
Daphne is a burlesque dancer.
All her friends are burlesque dancers.


182
00:14:01.695 --> 00:14:04.032
I don't have to spell it out for you,
do I, Barry?


183
00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:09.329
What do you say, I take a nap,
stay here, and we go together around nine?


184
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.873
I promised Will
I'd go to a party on campus.


185
00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:17.921
They will never accept us, Barry.
I know you know this, my brother.


186
00:14:18.004 --> 00:14:21.132
-I don't know. I wanna think they will.
-You think too much.


187
00:14:21.215 --> 00:14:22.758
That's your problem.
That's why you never get laid!


188
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:25.178
-I'm not trying to just get laid.
-Okay, see what I mean?


189
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.096
Fucking shit, man.
Look, if I were you... [sighs]

of the human condition.


195

Now, would you like to,
uh, unzip my pants, or shall I?"


196
00:14:46.698 --> 00:14:48.408
That's pretty good.
I didn't know you could do me.


197
00:14:48.492 --> 00:14:51.453
[in normal voice] Oh, well,
the trick is to sound just white enough.


198
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:54.374
Okay, fuck you, Saleem.

199

-Barry! Barry! I love you!
-Yeah, yeah.

00:22:29.244 --> 00:22:31.539
Could I have a beer and a special?

308
00:22:48.054 --> 00:22:49.055
Hey, baby.

309
00:22:51.057 --> 00:22:52.517
You're adorable.

310
00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:56.312
Who are you here with?

311
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.358
-[stammers] A friend.
-Do you guys like to party?


312
00:23:01.777 --> 00:23:03.069
[chuckles]

313
00:23:03.153 --> 00:23:04.864
Define "party."

[laughs]

315
00:23:07.449 --> 00:23:08.575
Adorable.

"At The Party" playing]


318
00:23:49.407 --> 00:23:51.284
-Have you ever seen this?
-No.


319
00:23:51.367 --> 00:23:53.077
It's a New York thing.

320
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.596
[sighs]

321
00:24:12.388 --> 00:24:13.849
[giggles]

322
00:24:23.858 --> 00:24:27.862
I dunno, man, it's--
It feels provincial up here somehow.


323
00:24:28.739 --> 00:24:29.782
Like it's a bubble.

324
00:24:29.864 --> 00:24:33.618
I mean, most of these kids,
their futures are already set.


325
00:24:33.994 --> 00:24:38.707
Like, um, that guy's gonna be
an econ major, and then Wall Street.


326
00:24:38.791 --> 00:24:39.708
[laughs]

327
00:24:39.792 --> 00:24:41.251
He thinks he wants to study history,

328
00:24:41.334 --> 00:24:45.171
but everything's pushing him
in another direction.


329
00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:46.339
His, um...

330
00:24:46.422 --> 00:24:49.969
His family, his background,
what people expect of him.


331
00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:52.053
So, does he really even have free will?

332
00:24:53.179 --> 00:24:55.890
You gotta take Moral Philosophy, man,
I'm telling you.


333
00:24:55.975 --> 00:24:57.392
We talk about this stuff all day.

334
00:24:57.475 --> 00:25:01.479
I read somewhere that, uh, college
isn't about learning.


335
00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:03.439
[stammers] It's about training.

336
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.650
Training for what?

337
00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:06.819
To, uh...

338
00:25:07.652 --> 00:25:10.572
To want what you don't need,
and to leave who you are at the door.


339
00:25:11.573 --> 00:25:14.117
But we're supposed to leave who we are
at the door. That's the point.


340
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.203
Well, some people can't leave
who they are at the door. I mean...


341
00:25:17.537 --> 00:25:19.832
You know I'm the only Black person
in four of my five classes.


342
00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:21.499
But you're half white, too.

343
00:25:22.208 --> 00:25:23.585
What's that supposed to mean?

344
00:25:24.168 --> 00:25:26.589
Just that... you can fit in anywhere.

345
00:25:26.672 --> 00:25:29.215
-Right?
-I fit in nowhere, Will.

But... [clears throat]

348
00:25:33.721 --> 00:25:36.599
-I did meet this girl last night.
-Yeah?


349
00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:37.265
Mm-hm.

[both laugh]

351
00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:43.104
[man on TV] The perception of many people
is that the city is dirtier, crime is up,

355
00:25:49.402 --> 00:25:51.654
[Ed Koch on TV] No, I'm relying on
the common sense of the people.


356
00:25:51.738 --> 00:25:54.657
I'm hesitant to judge
whether or not we've accomplished


357
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:58.620
the first part of what had to be done
with this fiscal stability

-so as to bring it to the point
-True.


359
00:26:00.956 --> 00:26:03.834
where we could enhance the services
and we have, in fact,


360
00:26:03.917 --> 00:26:06.629
improved some of the services
in the first four years...


361
00:26:06.712 --> 00:26:08.005
The biggest city in America,

362
00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:10.758
and this guy gets to run
as a Democrat and a Republican?


363
00:26:10.841 --> 00:26:11.967
It's a fucking joke.

364
00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:14.720
Well, nobody's watching except us.

365
00:26:14.803 --> 00:26:20.308
-So... why are we watching?
-It's our civic duty.


366
00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:23.812
You know, politics is bullshit.

367
00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:26.981
You don't really believe that, do you?

368
00:26:27.357 --> 00:26:28.816
Yeah. I mean, kinda.

369
00:26:29.317 --> 00:26:33.529
I mean, come on, the president's an actor.

370
00:26:33.613 --> 00:26:36.574
So how does change happen, then?

371
00:26:37.158 --> 00:26:40.578
-Or do you not believe in change, either?
-I believe in art.


372
00:26:40.663 --> 00:26:43.289
I believe in... I don't know.

I just don't believe in--


374
00:26:46.417 --> 00:26:48.628
If you say "the system,"
I'm going to scream.

00:26:48.711 --> 00:26:51.047
-The system.
-Oh, you're one of them!


376
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.800
-What? A socialist?
-A poet!


377
00:26:54.093 --> 00:26:55.510

381
00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:03.769
Your politics.

382
00:27:04.352 --> 00:27:07.856
Hmm. My politics... are cute.

383
00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:10.608
Yeah.

384
00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:14.113
I'll take that.

385
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.034
...only when we have
the money to do it.

386

Then I'm asking you to come to the polls,
'cause my opponent is apathy.


387
00:27:23.204 --> 00:27:27.375
People have to know that
if you want me back, come to the polls


388
00:27:27.458 --> 00:27:30.420
because the people who don't like me
are gonna rush to the polls


389

and that is the message that I'm imploring
everybody out there to consider.

I mean, I barely left New York.

Yeah, but-
- I mean, it's New York.

Yo! Invisible!

464
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:09.092
-What's up, Ali? [chuckles]
-Yo! You going by the courts today?


465
00:33:09.176 --> 00:33:12.887
Yo, this dude got the ill baby skyhook.
Like Magic.


466
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.723
-Gonna try. You?
-For sure. Maybe 'round two.


467
00:33:15.806 --> 00:33:18.726
-Cool. I'll catch you there.
-All right then. Be easy, homeboy.


468
00:33:18.809 --> 00:33:19.602
Like Sunday morning.

469
00:33:19.685 --> 00:33:22.271
[preacher]
"Can the prey be taken from the mighty,


470
00:33:22.354 --> 00:33:24.482
or the captives of a tyrant rescued?"

471
00:33:25.442 --> 00:33:29.279
[preacher] Now what that means is,
can we, the Lost Tribe of Israel,


472
00:33:29.362 --> 00:33:33.991
reclaim what is rightfully ours
from the cave-dwelling white devils


473
00:33:34.076 --> 00:33:37.120
that raped our ancestors, stole our land,

474
00:33:37.203 --> 00:33:40.539
and dispersed the true children of God
across the globe?


475
00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:43.168
-Read!
-[woman] Hey!


476
00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:47.838
I ain't... no devil.
This is not the words of Jesus Christ.


477
00:33:47.922 --> 00:33:49.799
Shut your mouth, cave bitch!

478
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.135
Yes, you are a cave bitch.

479
00:33:54.136 --> 00:33:58.057
Do you know... what Jesus Christ
called the white woman in the Bible?


480
00:33:58.849 --> 00:34:00.309
A female dog.

481
00:34:01.852 --> 00:34:03.604
And what is a female dog?

482
00:34:04.647 --> 00:34:06.524
Don't be afraid to say it, brother.
That's right.


483
00:34:07.108 --> 00:34:07.942
A bitch.

484
00:34:08.025 --> 00:34:10.403
That's what Jesus Christ called you
in the Bible.


485
00:34:10.487 --> 00:34:12.696
[Barry] How come you're using
a King James Bible?


486
00:34:13.823 --> 00:34:16.576
-What?
-[chuckles] Why that edition?


487
00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.578
[stammers] I thought King James
was a white devil.


488
00:34:21.455 --> 00:34:23.874
Here's King James right here.
Take a good look.


489
00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:27.837
He looks like Billy Dee Williams
if you'd ask me.


490
00:34:29.046 --> 00:34:30.131
If you say so, brother.

491
00:34:33.426 --> 00:34:34.802
Now, you might ask...

492
00:34:34.885 --> 00:34:39.014
How did the Lost Tribes of Israel
become lost? Well, I'll tell you.


493
00:34:39.098 --> 00:34:41.767
[club music playing]

494
00:34:41.851 --> 00:34:43.102
[Saleem] How about her?

495
00:34:43.894 --> 00:34:45.688
-No way.
-Why not?


496
00:34:46.481 --> 00:34:48.899
She's trying way too hard.
Zero self-esteem.


497
00:34:48.983 --> 00:34:52.529
-[Saleem] So she'd sleep with me.
-[Charlotte] Um, probably?


498
00:34:53.028 --> 00:34:58.534
-So that's a yes, then.
-No. Big time no.


499
00:34:58.618 --> 00:35:01.871
I don't think you understand the nature
of this conversation, Charlotte.


500
00:35:01.954 --> 00:35:04.081
I don't really think I want to.

501
00:35:06.251 --> 00:35:08.836
Looks like your boyfriend's off
on Pluto again.


502
00:35:09.753 --> 00:35:13.090
Um... Ground Control to Barry.

503
00:35:13.757 --> 00:35:15.384
Oh, sorry. I was, um...

504
00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:17.720
-I was thinking...
-[Charlotte] No.


505
00:35:17.803 --> 00:35:19.013
-[Barry] Nah.
-[Charlotte chuckles]


506
00:35:19.889 --> 00:35:22.517
-Hey, Will.
-Hi, guys. What's up?


507
00:35:22.601 --> 00:35:25.645
Hey, Willy. What's this?
Buy one, get two free?


508
00:35:26.438 --> 00:35:29.064
-[chuckles]
-[Barry] You wanna join us?


509
00:35:29.148 --> 00:35:31.150
Uh... No, thanks.

510
00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:33.485
I think we're gonna check out
the band downstairs.


511
00:35:33.569 --> 00:35:37.031
-Okay. Well, um, I'll see you around.
-Yeah. See you, man.


512
00:35:38.866 --> 00:35:42.287
So, what are you guys doing
for Thanksgiving? Hmm?


513
00:35:42.369 --> 00:35:45.956
Anybody here dig,
uh, turkey tikka masala?


514
00:35:46.374 --> 00:35:48.460
I'm going to Connecticut.

515
00:35:49.835 --> 00:35:51.712
You guys are welcome to come with me.

516
00:35:51.795 --> 00:35:53.298
You can meet the clown
my sister's marrying.


517
00:35:53.381 --> 00:35:56.175
Well, I love clowns.
Let's go to Connecticut, Barry.


518
00:35:56.259 --> 00:35:59.011
I'm, um... I'm allergic to Connecticut.

519
00:35:59.094 --> 00:36:02.349
I break out into these,
um, gross white hives.


520
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:04.725
Uh-
- Besides, I...

521
00:36:05.227 --> 00:36:07.270
I'm sure your, uh, family
would love you showing up


522
00:36:07.354 --> 00:36:08.854
with a Pakistani and a Black guy.

523
00:36:08.938 --> 00:36:10.482
Oh, well, you're not that black, Barry.

524
00:36:10.565 --> 00:36:12.149
-[scoffs]
-[Charlotte] No, seriously.


525
00:36:12.733 --> 00:36:13.943
They really wanna meet you.

526
00:36:14.026 --> 00:36:16.153
Uh, I wanna meet them too.

527
00:36:16.238 --> 00:36:19.949
But maybe we should do it
on a more neutral ground.


528
00:36:20.032 --> 00:36:22.034
Someplace with a lot of witnesses.

529
00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:25.871
I'm gonna go talk to that girl
with low self-esteem.


530
00:36:25.955 --> 00:36:28.375
Look, my parents are gonna love you.

531
00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:30.710
I'm sure some of their very best friends
are Black.


532
00:36:30.793 --> 00:36:32.379
They are, actually.

533
00:36:33.212 --> 00:36:35.547
-I was--
-I know what you were doing.


534
00:36:36.048 --> 00:36:40.135
The question is...
why you feel the need to do it.


535
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:44.431
Look, I just really want
to spend Thanksgiving with you.


536
00:36:45.933 --> 00:36:48.311
Maybe we could do
it here, a day early.

537
00:36:49.688 --> 00:36:51.481
And then, I can go
to Connecticut by myself


538
00:36:51.564 --> 00:36:52.524
if you don't wanna come with me.

539
00:36:53.399 --> 00:36:55.818
[stammers] I'd like that.

540
00:36:57.987 --> 00:36:59.489
[Saleem] ...from the campus.

541
00:36:59.572 --> 00:37:03.867
-They're students. I'm not... really old.
-[both chuckle]


542
00:37:03.951 --> 00:37:06.912
[professor]
Now, here we have, if you'd like,


543
00:37:06.996 --> 00:37:11.626
a basic epistemological principle
that we must bear in mind.


544
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.878
A genuine knowledge
involves cognitive union


545
00:37:14.962 --> 00:37:19.008
and overcoming
our estrangement or alienation.


546
00:37:19.091 --> 00:37:23.388
And this applies, I suppose,
to all spheres of our knowledge.


547
00:37:23.471 --> 00:37:26.516
I sometimes argue
that, to be a good scientist...


548
00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:30.687
[helicopter whirring]

549
00:37:36.817 --> 00:37:43.198
[siren wailing]

550
00:38:19.652 --> 00:38:20.653
[exhales deeply]

551
00:39:38.397 --> 00:39:42.151
So, I'm a little worried about Saleem
being in charge of Thanksgiving.


552
00:39:42.234 --> 00:39:43.569
I mean, can he even cook?

553
00:39:45.028 --> 00:39:48.115
Everything about that man is a mystery,
including these ingredients.


554
00:39:48.198 --> 00:39:52.244
Uh, yeah, what is "ghee"? [chuckles]

555
00:39:53.412 --> 00:39:55.164
And, um... [clicks tongue]

556
00:39:55.247 --> 00:39:57.958
you may have gotten out
of Thanksgiving with my family,


557
00:39:58.041 --> 00:40:00.712
but that means I'm gonna have
to take you to my sister's wedding.


558
00:40:00.794 --> 00:40:03.297
-[Barry] Hmm...
-And you're gonna have fun.


559
00:40:05.675 --> 00:40:07.342
You know I'm gonna cause a scene
at that wedding.


560
00:40:07.426 --> 00:40:08.470
-Oh, really?
-Mm.


561
00:40:08.553 --> 00:40:11.096
Once folks get a load
of my moves on the dance floor...


562
00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.222
Be a miracle. [chuckles]

563
00:40:15.642 --> 00:40:16.977
-[Ann] Aloha!-[Ann] Aloha!
-Mom?


564
00:40:18.813 --> 00:40:21.524
-Surprise!
-[Saleem] Surprise!


565
00:40:21.608 --> 00:40:23.025
You're supposed to be in Jakarta.

566
00:40:23.108 --> 00:40:26.069
I had a conference in LA.
Oh, my word. And here I am!


567
00:40:26.153 --> 00:40:28.030
-Here she is!
-My beauty.


568
00:40:28.989 --> 00:40:29.990
Uh...

569
00:40:30.073 --> 00:40:32.367
[stammering] Uh... Mom.

570
00:40:33.243 --> 00:40:36.079
-Uh... This is, uh, Charlotte.
-Charlotte.


571
00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:38.541
Hello. Such a pleasure to meet you, Mrs.--

572
00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:41.669
Ann. Just Ann, honey.
It's nice to meet you, too.


573
00:40:41.753 --> 00:40:44.631
[slow music playing on radio]

574
00:40:46.173 --> 00:40:48.634
-Charlotte, some peas, please.
-Mm-hm.


575
00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:51.345
Barry, honey, do you have a salad bowl?

576
00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:03.440
-Does this work?
-How about a knife?


577
00:41:09.279 --> 00:41:10.573
How about this?

578
00:41:10.657 --> 00:41:14.911
-Not exactly Julia Child, huh?
-Well, Saleem's sort of a child.


579
00:41:14.994 --> 00:41:17.580
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're sort of a poopy-head.


580
00:41:18.497 --> 00:41:21.208
Is the atmosphere around here
always so intellectually charged?


581
00:41:21.291 --> 00:41:23.753
-Oh, yeah.
-Well, you know, as a feminist,


582
00:41:23.836 --> 00:41:27.549
I would never endorse this sort
of retrograde patriarchal paradigm


583
00:41:27.632 --> 00:41:30.718
that would paint you as a sort
of domesticating, civilizing presence


584
00:41:30.802 --> 00:41:33.012
-in this household.
-Oh, no. Of course not.


585
00:41:33.095 --> 00:41:35.848
But if I did, I would say
that you have got your hands full


586
00:41:35.932 --> 00:41:36.891
with these two knuckleheads.

587
00:41:36.975 --> 00:41:39.142
-[Charlotte chuckles]
-Damn, Barry.


588
00:41:39.226 --> 00:41:41.311
Your mom can talk some shit.

589
00:41:41.395 --> 00:41:42.855
[chuckles]

590
00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:45.567
[Charlotte] So, do we get to hear
some embarrassing stories


591
00:41:45.649 --> 00:41:46.733
about Barry or what?

592
00:41:48.193 --> 00:41:50.529
I'm sorry to be dull,
but I don't really have any.


593
00:41:50.613 --> 00:41:52.949
He was so easy.
Even his birth was easy.


594
00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:56.368
I was 19 at that time,
so that wasn't the easiest, and...


595
00:41:57.244 --> 00:41:59.914
Neither was his dad,
but what can I say?

596
00:41:59.997 --> 00:42:01.248
He's my darling boy.

597
00:42:02.165 --> 00:42:04.251
[Charlotte]
What wasn't easy about his dad?


598
00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:06.169
Barry barely talks about him.

599
00:42:06.253 --> 00:42:10.424
All I know is that he's some kind
of high-up government official.


600
00:42:11.341 --> 00:42:12.426
I only met him once.

601
00:42:13.385 --> 00:42:15.722
He showed up in Hawaii
when I was ten and...


602
00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:17.347
tried to tell me
how to live my life.

603
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.643
That's not true.
He was around when you were little.


604
00:42:22.269 --> 00:42:24.772
He's a lovely man. We just
weren't well-suited for each other.


605
00:42:24.856 --> 00:42:26.649
-Hmm.
-[Barry] Hmm.


606
00:42:26.733 --> 00:42:30.862
Mm, 'cause he had another family
in Kenya, Mom. He lied to you.


607
00:42:30.945 --> 00:42:34.156
It's a little more complicated than that.
But we don't have to talk about it.


608
00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:36.909
Okay. She always defends him.

609
00:42:36.992 --> 00:42:37.659
You know what?

610
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.870
He gave me you.

611
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.960
But Barry must've had

Mm. That's something
no white woman should do.

first, you marry an Indonesian guy.

Then you... move to Indonesia
and, uh, realize you need a job.

-That... makes two of us?


743
00:52:24.413 --> 00:52:28.041
Yes, sir. My, uh, father did
his Ph.D. in Economics there,


744

as a matter of fact.

-Well, he must be brilliant.
-Oh, he is something.


746
00:52:33.672 --> 00:52:35.299
I mean, Dad was born in Kenya.

747
00:52:35.882 --> 00:52:37.175
And he and my mother met

748
00:52:37.259 --> 00:52:39.678
when he was studying
at the University of Hawaii.


749
00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:41.597
The program
that brought him over was, uh...


750
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.765
was funded by the likes of, uh...

751
00:52:43.848 --> 00:52:46.976
Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier,
uh, and the Kennedys.


752
00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.063
How remarkable. 
And, uh, where is he now?

753
00:52:50.146 --> 00:52:52.274
Uh... Dad's back in Nairobi.

754
00:52:52.358 --> 00:52:55.694
[chuckles] I believe his title
is Senior Government Economist.


755
00:52:56.445 --> 00:52:58.530
-Hmm.
-[Kathy] Such a fascinating country.

Are you able to visit often?

757
00:53:00.031 --> 00:53:02.534
I plan on going soon.
Well, as soon as, uh...


758
00:53:02.618 --> 00:53:05.246
Charlotte teaches me
a little more Swahili.


759
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:09.250
Oh... after I finish teaching him
about New York City politics.


760
00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:12.294
-That could take a while.
-And some alcohol.


761
00:53:12.378 --> 00:53:15.964
Well, uh... I hear you're something
of a political organizer, Mr. Baughman.


762
00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:19.092
Oh, no. I wouldn't say that.

763
00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:24.515
I've arranged bail for some organizers.
Represented the unions for years.


764
00:53:24.598 --> 00:53:27.643
But nowadays, I spend more time
raising money for candidates.


765
00:53:27.725 --> 00:53:31.396
It's not something
I particularly enjoy, but...


766
00:53:32.397 --> 00:53:33.940
it's more important than ever.

767
00:53:34.023 --> 00:53:38.612
Pretty soon, our only real game plan
might be to outspend the bad guys.


768
00:53:38.696 --> 00:53:42.865
Oh, and, uh, hope all that money
doesn't turn everybody into bad guys. Hmm.


769
00:53:42.949 --> 00:53:45.703
-Something like that.
-[Charlotte] Oh, come on, Dad.


770
00:53:45.785 --> 00:53:47.329
I've seen those pictures of you

771
00:53:47.412 --> 00:53:50.039
and your ponytail
marching for civil rights.


772
00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.710
-Sure, but everybody did that.
-Oh, not everybody.


773
00:53:54.043 --> 00:53:57.755
Of course, not everybody.
But everybody we knew in our little...


774
00:53:58.131 --> 00:53:59.882
liberal enclave.

775
00:54:00.091 --> 00:54:01.719
So, how'd your, uh, parents...

776
00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:04.388
feel about your, uh, you know,
"little liberal enclave"?


777
00:54:06.514 --> 00:54:09.559
Mine... not so good. Bill's...

778
00:54:10.059 --> 00:54:11.519
Worse. [sighs]

779
00:54:11.603 --> 00:54:16.317
But, you know, without their support,
I don't know if I'd have had the courage


780
00:54:16.399 --> 00:54:18.484
to spend my career
fighting the good fight.


781
00:54:19.485 --> 00:54:21.487
I might've gone corporate. Who knows?

782
00:54:21.988 --> 00:54:24.282
Now, I've got a good friend
who's making that decision right now.


783
00:54:25.158 --> 00:54:28.286
He's from the Grant Houses,
if you, uh, know where those are.


784
00:54:29.747 --> 00:54:32.874
-No, I don't believe so. No.
-Harlem.


785
00:54:32.957 --> 00:54:36.252
It's one of the biggest
public housing projects in the city.


786
00:54:36.336 --> 00:54:40.965
Now, he says he, um, didn't make it
to Columbia not to earn money.


787
00:54:41.467 --> 00:54:43.385
Well, that's very understandable.

788
00:54:44.218 --> 00:54:48.474
Yeah. I don't know. It's, um...
I think he's gonna be miserable.


789
00:54:49.766 --> 00:54:50.683
Mm.

790
00:54:54.145 --> 00:54:56.648
But, hey... [chuckles] But what do I know?

791
00:54:57.231 --> 00:55:01.986
Aside from that fact
that these lamb chops sound amazing.


792
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.531
[Bill] Mm, well, 
I couldn't agree more.

793
00:55:08.993 --> 00:55:13.374
-Can we give you a lift back to school?
-Uh, no, thanks. We're going downtown.


794
00:55:13.457 --> 00:55:17.753
-Oh, we are?
-Yes. You... need to dance.


795
00:56:00.796 --> 00:56:02.130
-You think--
-You think you need to teach me.


796
00:56:02.213 --> 00:56:04.006
-I need to teach you?
-[chuckles] Are you kidding?


797
00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:06.050
-That girl was positively afraid of you.
-I wasn't...


798
00:56:06.134 --> 00:56:09.220
Hey, good evening
to you two lovely lovebirds.


799
00:56:09.303 --> 00:56:10.346
Y'all had a good night?

800
00:56:10.431 --> 00:56:11.473
-Mm-hm.
-Great night.


801
00:56:12.098 --> 00:56:13.307
You got a square, college?

802
00:56:13.809 --> 00:56:17.270
-Uh, it's my last one, boss.
-Come on, give me a bust-down, then.


803
00:56:17.562 --> 00:56:18.229
Okay.

804
00:56:22.108 --> 00:56:26.572
Keep it. One of these days,
I'ma make you buy me a pack.


805
00:56:26.654 --> 00:56:28.990
-[Charlotte chuckles]
-[Milton] Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.


806
00:56:29.491 --> 00:56:31.033
What you just try
to say to my mans?

807
00:56:31.826 --> 00:56:33.119
You gonna make him?

808
00:56:33.495 --> 00:56:35.079
-Who the fuck is you, nigga?
-[bottle shatters]


809
00:56:35.163 --> 00:56:36.414
Coño! Relax, Milton!

810
00:56:36.498 --> 00:56:38.542
[Milton] Now, who the fuck said
you could walk down my block?


811
00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:40.919
Yo! This kid is cool, Milt.

812
00:56:41.002 --> 00:56:42.378
-Chill out, bro.
-He don't look cool to me.


813
00:56:42.462 --> 00:56:45.298
-Nigga look like a motherfuckin' pussy.
-Man, I live here.


814
00:56:46.675 --> 00:56:49.343
Fuck you. You... ain't from here.

815
00:56:49.427 --> 00:56:52.263
[stammers] I didn't say I was from here.
I said I live here, okay?


816
00:56:52.346 --> 00:56:54.265
-One forty-two.
-I'm from here!


817
00:56:54.766 --> 00:56:58.729
-You understand? Born and bred.
-Okay, that's great.


818
00:56:58.812 --> 00:57:01.314
-Good for you.
-The fuck is you're walking away from me?


819
00:57:01.397 --> 00:57:02.858
-What you gonna do now, nigga?
-Yo, yo!


820
00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.693
Yo, Milt! Chill out, man.
Yo, put that away!


821
00:57:06.777 --> 00:57:08.946
Yo! Mira, don't do some shit
you gonna regret!


822
00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:16.704
Go on, man.

823
00:57:27.925 --> 00:57:29.467
[sighs]

824
00:57:32.011 --> 00:57:34.013
Where are you taking me?

825
00:57:34.973 --> 00:57:35.891
Oh...

826
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.477
Hey, brother, you got
some of that, uh, Egyptian Musk?


827
00:57:39.561 --> 00:57:41.855
-[reggae music playing]
-Incense or oil?


828
00:57:41.939 --> 00:57:43.607
-[Barry] Uh, oil.
-[sniffs]


829
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:47.276
-One, three, five.
-I'll take a three.


830
00:57:51.949 --> 00:57:54.492
-Thank you.
-Thank you.


831
00:57:57.913 --> 00:57:58.914
You like that?

832
00:57:59.915 --> 00:58:02.543
Hmm.
That reminds me of my friend, Idris.


833
00:58:02.625 --> 00:58:04.335
He always used to wear Egyptian Musk.

834
00:58:05.253 --> 00:58:09.632
Hey, uh, try this. It's called Black Love.
Drives the sisters crazy.


835
00:58:10.341 --> 00:58:11.635
[stammers] I'm good, thanks.

836
00:58:13.302 --> 00:58:16.097
-Who's Idris?
-From junior year abroad?


837
00:58:16.598 --> 00:58:19.017
-He goes to Emory.
-Right.


838
00:58:23.981 --> 00:58:27.609
[indistinct chattering]

839
00:58:29.653 --> 00:58:30.654
[man] Good day, Miss Lady.

840
00:58:30.737 --> 00:58:32.238
-Hello.
-How are you?


841
00:58:33.364 --> 00:58:36.200
Hey, my man. Good to see you.

842
00:58:36.284 --> 00:58:38.662
How did you like that Du Bois
I hit you with?


843
00:58:38.745 --> 00:58:41.080
Deep. What else you got for me?

844
00:58:41.163 --> 00:58:44.375
Let me see here.
I think I know just what you need.


845
00:58:44.918 --> 00:58:47.713
-How about this? Ralph. Invisible Man.
-I already read it.


846
00:58:47.796 --> 00:58:50.423
Oh. I'm impressed.

847
00:58:50.506 --> 00:58:52.926
-You know, he lives not far from here.
-Oh, yeah?


848
00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:56.512
Yeah. We've been waiting
on a sequel for a long time.


849
00:58:56.597 --> 00:58:58.765
Maybe he said everything he needed to.

850
00:58:58.849 --> 00:59:01.727
He might've dropped a little too much
truth for them in this one, baby.


851
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:05.063
Oh, I love this book. 
Have you read this?

852
00:59:05.146 --> 00:59:07.608
Ah, you got good taste, Miss Lady.
James Baldwin.


853
00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:08.859
-Thank you.
-No, I haven't.


854
00:59:10.192 --> 00:59:13.195
-I'm buying it for you, then. How much?
-[man clicks tongue]


855
00:59:13.279 --> 00:59:16.700
-Um, that's on me.
-Thank you.


856
00:59:16.783 --> 00:59:17.951
-That's so sweet.
-My pleasure. Yeah.


857
00:59:18.534 --> 00:59:19.619
You guys enjoy your day.

858
00:59:26.627 --> 00:59:27.543
No, thank you.

859
00:59:27.627 --> 00:59:28.919
[preacher shouting indistinctly]

860
00:59:30.714 --> 00:59:33.132
Hey, can we have lunch at Sylvia's?

861
00:59:33.967 --> 00:59:36.928
-Where is that?
-You've never been to Sylvia's?


862
00:59:37.012 --> 00:59:39.347
No, Charlotte.
[stammers] I've never been to Sylvia's.


863
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:41.474
Trust me, you're gonna love it.
It's right over there.


864
00:59:41.557 --> 00:59:44.602
-[preacher] Men far away. And there...
-Yeah. Sylvia's it is.


865
00:59:44.686 --> 00:59:47.355
-...in the midst of this land.
-[reader] And he cursed Canaan.


866
00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:50.483
-[man chuckling]
-[chattering]


867
00:59:50.566 --> 00:59:54.988
-Ten bucks for a plate of fried chicken?
-It's so good, though.


868
00:59:55.072 --> 00:59:56.489
I guess these people don't mind.

869
00:59:56.572 --> 01:00:00.201
In here stuffing their faces
while folks panhandle right outside.


870
01:00:01.285 --> 01:00:05.247
-That's any restaurant.
-M&G, six blocks away.


871
01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:07.416
Same menu, it's four bucks a plate.

872
01:00:09.877 --> 01:00:11.420
Are you mad at me or something?

873
01:00:13.297 --> 01:00:15.174
Have you noticed
you're the only white person in here?


874
01:00:16.509 --> 01:00:18.636
No, I'm not.

875
01:00:19.805 --> 01:00:23.850
-And besides, why does that matter?
-Nobody's looking at you.


876
01:00:24.433 --> 01:00:25.935
They're looking at me.

877
01:00:26.728 --> 01:00:31.190
Uh, the brother with the...
uh... white girl on his arm.


878
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.984
Who?

879
01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:38.823
Who? Who, Barry?

880
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:41.702
You don't see it.

881
01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:42.869
-So show me.
-I can't.


882
01:00:45.371 --> 01:00:46.997
[scoffs] You're not used to being visible.

883
01:00:48.749 --> 01:00:49.291
"Visible"?

884
01:00:51.753 --> 01:00:54.380
I'm a woman.
You think I don't get stares? Catcalls?


885
01:00:54.463 --> 01:00:56.465
-[stammers] That's not what I mean.
-And besides,


886
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:58.927
I thought the whole problem
was being invisible.


887
01:01:03.013 --> 01:01:03.973
[waitress] You all ready to order?

888
01:01:18.113 --> 01:01:19.280
You wanna come up?

889
01:01:20.531 --> 01:01:23.617
No, I have...
I think I'm gonna go play some ball.


890
01:01:25.828 --> 01:01:27.621
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.


891
01:01:29.665 --> 01:01:32.002
-Call me later?
-Yeah, I will.


892
01:01:38.466 --> 01:01:39.425
Um...

893
01:01:46.474 --> 01:01:47.683
I love you.

894
01:01:54.941 --> 01:01:55.859
Thank you.

895
01:02:05.202 --> 01:02:07.703
[man] Uh... Brick.

896
01:02:07.787 --> 01:02:09.371
[all laugh]

897
01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:14.127
Hey, yo, Invis,
you should come out with us tonight.


898
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:15.836
What's on the agenda?

899
01:02:16.337 --> 01:02:20.424
-Your girl Tisha's having a thing.
-Tisha? Really?


900
01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:24.553
You don't need to be taking Invis
to nobody ghetto-ass house party.


901
01:02:24.637 --> 01:02:26.388
-Why not?
-Why not?


902
01:02:26.472 --> 01:02:28.016
[both laugh]

903
01:02:28.099 --> 01:02:31.644
Hey. This motherfucker's from Indonesia
and Hawaii and shit, man.


904
01:02:31.727 --> 01:02:33.188
You know what them niggas like, bro.

905
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:35.356
-Take him to a luau or somethin'.
-[all laugh]


906
01:02:35.439 --> 01:02:38.193
How's a brother supposed to get culture?

907
01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:39.652
Y'all serious?

908
01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:46.617
Whatever. Maybe y'all see, man.

909
01:02:47.869 --> 01:02:49.120
[PJ] Oh--

910
01:02:49.204 --> 01:02:51.372
-[all] Oh!
-[all laugh]


911
01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:55.877
"Thank you"?
What are you, Han Solo or some shit?


912
01:02:55.961 --> 01:02:58.796
Han didn't say "thank you."
He said, uh, "I know."


913
01:03:00.339 --> 01:03:03.051
'Cause that's the coolest way to say it.
Sure.


914
01:03:03.927 --> 01:03:05.303
I fucked up, huh?

915
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.722
Well, if you love the sister, you did.

916
01:03:10.851 --> 01:03:12.434
Why would she say it, then?

917
01:03:12.518 --> 01:03:14.979
After the worst two hours
of our whole relationship?


918
01:03:15.062 --> 01:03:16.105
[PJ] Hmm.

919
01:03:16.189 --> 01:03:20.110
Let me think. That's exactly why.
Look...


920
01:03:21.152 --> 01:03:25.489
If she says it to you again,
you either gotta say it back or walk off.


921
01:03:26.615 --> 01:03:27.993
[man] There he is.

922
01:03:31.787 --> 01:03:34.498
-[PJ] My man.
-[man] It's about time.


923
01:03:34.582 --> 01:03:36.293
[man] Thirsty?

924
01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:38.669
-Hell, yeah.
-Let's crack these babies.


925
01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.588
-[man mimics fizzing sound]
-[Barry] What's up, man?


926
01:03:40.671 --> 01:03:41.923
[man] All right.

927
01:03:42.006 --> 01:03:43.048
[beer cans opening]

928
01:03:43.132 --> 01:03:44.008
[man] Ooh.

929
01:03:47.012 --> 01:03:48.721
That's good.

930
01:03:48.804 --> 01:03:50.348
Look alive, Invisible.

931
01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.519
And welcome to this episode
of "Project Safari."


932
01:03:56.897 --> 01:04:00.733
Now, in the projects-
- Excuse us, ladies.

933
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:04.362
In the projects,
the elevators go out all the time.


934
01:04:04.445 --> 01:04:06.739
Now, if you're somebody
like my man, Mr. Jim here--


935
01:04:06.822 --> 01:04:08.158
-How you doin', Mr. Jim?
-How you doin', boy?


936
01:04:08.241 --> 01:04:11.702
Or if I'm some
old lady with grocery bags

937
01:04:11.785 --> 01:04:14.747
and I'm trying to get all the way up
to the tenth floor, you're wondering...


938
01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:18.459
-how do you get up there?
-You ask a nice young man for help.


939
01:04:19.919 --> 01:04:21.962
[all laughing]

940
01:04:23.464 --> 01:04:24.590
If you can find one.

941
01:04:24.673 --> 01:04:27.969
Hell, you sit your ass down on a bench
and wait for them to fix them shits.


942
01:04:28.053 --> 01:04:29.262
Hell, yeah.

943
01:04:30.638 --> 01:04:33.266
All right, now. 
Right through here,

944
01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:36.144
we have what you call
the "pissy staircase."


945
01:04:36.226 --> 01:04:37.478
For obvious reasons.

946
01:04:37.561 --> 01:04:40.272
I'm sure one of your five senses
has picked up as to why.


947
01:04:40.357 --> 01:04:42.775
Now, I would advise you
not to touch nothin'


948
01:04:42.858 --> 01:04:44.526
'cause you could get
the itchies and scratchies.


949
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:46.029
It's hard to get rid of that.

950
01:04:46.695 --> 01:04:47.821
So...

951
01:04:49.156 --> 01:04:51.200
You wanna see some more,
you wanna go to the party?


952
01:04:51.283 --> 01:04:52.076
What you wanna do?

953
01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.787
-More.
-More?


954
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.206
Come on, man, I
got ladies waiting for me.

955
01:04:57.873 --> 01:05:00.209
You know damn well
ain't nobody waiting on you.


956
01:05:00.793 --> 01:05:03.087
[chuckles] He lying.
Come on, we'll see y'all later.


957
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:06.048
Come on, B. Right this way. Now...

958
01:05:06.924 --> 01:05:10.302
The projects ain't all fun and games.
Matter of fact, far from it.


959
01:05:10.636 --> 01:05:12.972
But you do gotta keep
a sense of adventure.


960
01:05:13.431 --> 01:05:14.890
That's why police hate coming up here

961
01:05:14.975 --> 01:05:17.394
because you'll never know
what's behind door number one,


962
01:05:17.476 --> 01:05:19.437
behind door number two...

963
01:05:20.854 --> 01:05:24.692
Matter of fact, you...
you know what a "shooting gallery" is, B?


964
01:05:27.486 --> 01:05:29.613
Well, take a look
behind door number three.


965
01:05:30.864 --> 01:05:32.242
It ain't for guns.

966
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:42.210
Then you got motherfuckers like me.

967
01:05:43.752 --> 01:05:48.133
Same environment, same everything.
And what the fuck, right?


968
01:05:49.758 --> 01:05:53.179
But, I guess life
is what you make it.

969
01:05:54.972 --> 01:05:57.933
One thing to remember, though,
through all of this.


970
01:05:59.643 --> 01:06:01.187
This is government housing.

971
01:06:02.896 --> 01:06:04.815
This is how the government
does our people.


972
01:06:09.404 --> 01:06:14.159
So, this concludes our episode
of "Project Safari."


973
01:06:14.242 --> 01:06:18.329
I've been your host,
and I need another beer.


974
01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:23.751
This one is gone. Excuse us.

975
01:06:25.295 --> 01:06:26.463
Right this way.

976
01:06:26.545 --> 01:06:29.257
[Ahzz's "New York's Movin'" playing]

977
01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.884
[PJ] All right!

978
01:06:31.967 --> 01:06:35.138
How you doing? 
You look amazing.

979
01:06:48.859 --> 01:06:50.111
So, what you think?

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.821
It's beautiful.

[PJ laughs]

983
01:06:56.033 --> 01:06:59.370
Whatever you say, B.
Enjoy yourself, though.


984
01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:04.917
-[Lila] Hey.
-Hey.


985
01:07:06.544 --> 01:07:08.962
-How you doin', PJ?
-I'm good, Ms. Denise.


986
01:07:09.046 --> 01:07:12.092
-I'm fair for a square. How you doing?
-Good.


987
01:07:21.184 --> 01:07:24.354
Yo, Invisible! Come over here,
come over here, come over here.


988
01:07:26.314 --> 01:07:28.816
I got some people I want you to meet.
This is my girl Tisha, this is her crib.


989
01:07:28.899 --> 01:07:30.568
-Barry.
-Welcome, yeah.


990
01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:33.404
[PJ] This is Lila. 
Keep your hands off.

991
01:07:34.655 --> 01:07:36.157
And Ms. Denise.

992
01:07:36.241 --> 01:07:39.868
-Barry. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.


993
01:07:41.912 --> 01:07:43.831
Mm. Nice.

994
01:07:45.749 --> 01:07:46.750
Wanna dance?

995
01:07:47.668 --> 01:07:48.836
Sure.

996
01:08:23.579 --> 01:08:26.248
So... where are you from?

997
01:08:27.833 --> 01:08:31.211
I live on 109th and Amsterdam. You?

998
01:08:31.296 --> 01:08:34.549
[Taana Gardner's "Heartbeat" plays]

-Heaven?

1001

What's living on the eighth floor like?

1002
01:08:58.573 --> 01:09:02.159
[laughs] Well,
it's pretty much exactly like this.


1003
01:09:02.243 --> 01:09:03.620
Why, you wanna see it?

1004
01:09:04.745 --> 01:09:06.038
Uh...

1005
01:09:06.997 --> 01:09:08.499
I wanna see everything.

1006
01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:15.130
-So... why do they call you "Invisible"?
-It's because I'm spying.


1007
01:09:15.215 --> 01:09:17.716
I probably shouldn't have told you that,
but I'm getting a good vibe.

-You seem trustworthy.
-Who do you work for?


1010
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:22.639
I'm freelance.

1011
01:09:22.721 --> 01:09:26.517
Sometimes I spy
just for my own, um, edification.

I think that's called a Peeping Tom.

-Who is he?

-Yes.

-What happened to your face, B?

-Some asshole hit me.
-I'll get some ice.

you do to get hit?

That was supposed to be for your face.

-No, you don't gotta go.

Why, Barry?

01:14:05.462 --> 01:14:07.422
That's why you're an asshole.

You're all right, Thad.

You're an asshole...

but you're all right.

-I don't want to talk.

-What happened to you?
-It's nothing.


1078
01:15:15.658 --> 01:15:16.867
Where were you tonight?

1079
01:15:17.868 --> 01:15:21.454
At a party. In Harlem.
Your favorite place.


1080
01:15:25.793 --> 01:15:27.168
I'm going to clean you up.

01:16:04.456 --> 01:16:05.457
-Here.
-Don't.


1082
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:09.461
Stop.

1083
01:16:16.134 --> 01:16:17.469
What's the matter with you?

1084
01:16:20.847 --> 01:16:22.432
Why do you like me, Charlotte?

1085
01:16:27.354 --> 01:16:28.355
What do you mean?

1086

-I like you 'cause I like you.
-No. Really.

Why do you like me?

1088
01:16:37.989 --> 01:16:39.658
Who wouldn't like that guy?

1089
01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:43.954
That's not me, Charlotte.

1090
01:16:45.372 --> 01:16:46.623
It was a joke.

1091
01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.839
Just because you went to Kenya
for five days,


1092
01:16:55.715 --> 01:16:58.677
doesn't mean you understand who I am.

You think that this... is all about you.

Good night.

1097

-[Will] What happened to your face?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

Man, listen, um...

01:18:02.116 --> 01:18:06.578
one of the guys at Robbie's suite
just moved out, so...

there's a room open.

-You should take it.
-Are you sure? I...


1102
01:18:14.544 --> 01:18:16.421
I know you can afford the rent
by yourself.

-I just thought--
-I'm ready for a change anyway.


1104
01:18:18.924 --> 01:18:20.134
Yeah.

1105
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:22.218
No, I...

1106
01:18:22.845 --> 01:18:24.221
I can move in with Saleem.

1107
01:18:27.515 --> 01:18:30.477
I just feel isolated from campus,
you know?


1108
01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.063
It's cool, Will. I get it.

1109
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.572
-We'll still hang out, right?
-Yeah. Of course.

and whoever you're dating, you marry?

It's not just my sister, either.
It's all of her friends--

and then, bam,

Well, would you ever want to get married?

I don't mean now.
I don't even mean to me.

you could see yourself doing someday?

No, it's, uh, not an institution
I put much faith in.

01:26:32.459 --> 01:26:36.087
I mean, my parents were married five times
between them. Or six.

01:26:36.170 --> 01:26:37.922
And I'm not even sure about my father.

Well... are you nervous
about meeting my family?

-No.

-Where you guys from?
-We are Ugandan.


1198
01:29:15.204 --> 01:29:16.664
I thought so.

01:29:17.915 --> 01:29:20.292
My, uh... father is from Kenya.

1200

Ah! [chuckles]

Here you go.

1202
01:29:24.713 --> 01:29:25.840
Yeah. He...

1203
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:28.384
He died recently.

1204
01:29:29.553 --> 01:29:32.221
My condolences to you and to your family.

1205

Mine as well.

1206
01:29:35.057 --> 01:29:36.267
Yeah, thanks.

1207

[stammers] I will have a drink.


1212

-What do you got back there?
-It's a full bar, sir.


1213
01:30:10.801 --> 01:30:11.677
I'll have a...

1214
01:30:12.804 --> 01:30:14.138
I'll have a vodka.

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.566
-Barry.
-Good to meet you.


1219
01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:09.360
-Barry, this is Donna.
-Barry.


1220
01:31:09.443 --> 01:31:11.362
-Ted.
-Barry.


1221
01:31:11.445 --> 01:31:13.030
-And Emily.
-Pleasure.


1222
01:31:13.782 --> 01:31:17.243
-Oh, and this is my cousin, Melissa.
-Barry.


1223
01:31:18.202 --> 01:31:19.370
Hey.

1224
01:31:20.287 --> 01:31:23.499
Barry, there's someone
I'm dying to introduce you to.


1225
01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:25.334
-Just when I thought I'd met everyone.
-Hmm.


1226
01:31:40.432 --> 01:31:43.770
Barry, meet James and Grace Lee.

1227
01:31:43.853 --> 01:31:47.356
Two of the most brilliant,
committed writers and activists


1228
01:31:47.439 --> 01:31:49.943
-I have ever had the pleasure to know.
-Well, I'm honored to meet you.


1229
01:31:50.735 --> 01:31:54.739
Grace Lee tried to convince Malcolm X
to run for Senate in '64.


1230
01:31:54.823 --> 01:31:57.199
-It almost worked, too.
-[Barry] Wow.


1231
01:31:57.867 --> 01:32:00.787
I thought you might want to meet them.
Especially because of your parents.


1232
01:32:05.584 --> 01:32:06.710
[James] Have a seat, Barry.

1233
01:32:10.005 --> 01:32:11.213
Are your parents in the movement?

1234
01:32:11.297 --> 01:32:13.299
Uh, no. Not really.

1235
01:32:13.841 --> 01:32:17.469
They're, uh, different races.
I'm guessing that's what Kathy meant.


1236
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:20.472
Ah, I see.

1237
01:32:21.515 --> 01:32:26.562
[stammers] My mom's from Kansas,
and my dad's from Kenya.


1238
01:32:28.815 --> 01:32:30.609
I've only met him once, though.

1239
01:32:31.818 --> 01:32:34.236
I grew up in Jakarta and Honolulu,

1240
01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:38.825
and spent a little time in California,
then, well, I ended up here.


1241
01:32:40.117 --> 01:32:41.368
That's some kinda gumbo.

1242
01:32:41.452 --> 01:32:43.788
[James and Grace Lee chuckle]

1243
01:32:44.831 --> 01:32:46.248
You know what that makes you,
young brother?


1244
01:32:47.291 --> 01:32:49.794
No, sir. [stammers] I don't.

1245
01:32:49.877 --> 01:32:52.004
I really, really don't.

1246
01:32:53.339 --> 01:32:57.176
It makes you American.
And you don't ever have to choose.


1247
01:33:03.265 --> 01:33:08.145
You know, I see you both
sitting here together, in love.


1248
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:09.146
[chuckles]

1249
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:11.231
-Yes, sir.
-And full of wisdom.


1250
01:33:11.732 --> 01:33:13.609
And I can't help but think that...

1251
01:33:14.318 --> 01:33:16.362
the two of you must have been
through all kinds of hell together.


1252
01:33:16.445 --> 01:33:20.616
Doing what you've done.
And looking how you look.


1253
01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:23.494
You take the baton
from the ones who've come before,


1254
01:33:23.577 --> 01:33:25.829
and you carry it
as far as you can.

1255
01:33:26.288 --> 01:33:27.665
And then you hand it off.

1256
01:33:28.999 --> 01:33:31.502
That's life. A beautiful struggle.

1257
01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.339
[Nina Simone's "I Will Be Released"
playing]


1258
01:33:54.274 --> 01:33:55.317
Hey.

1259
01:33:58.154 --> 01:33:59.363
Dance with me.

1260
01:36:57.708 --> 01:36:58.792
[Barry] "Dear Dad,

1261
01:37:00.128 --> 01:37:02.922
I am sorry it has taken me so long
to write you back.


1262
01:37:04.423 --> 01:37:07.010
I have thought of you
and your invitation to visit every day.


1263
01:37:07.969 --> 01:37:10.804
Sometimes I feel
that there's a part of me I do not know,


1264
01:37:12.723 --> 01:37:14.309
and when I am feeling optimistic,

1265
01:37:14.391 --> 01:37:16.978
I find myself believing that you hold
the answers I am looking for.


1266
01:37:19.146 --> 01:37:21.899
My journey so far has not been
as dramatic as yours,


1267
01:37:22.316 --> 01:37:25.569
but I'd like to think I can imagine
what you felt when you arrived in Hawaii.


1268
01:37:26.321 --> 01:37:28.697
Perhaps even what you felt
when you met Mom.


1269
01:37:30.616 --> 01:37:34.453
I suppose I have spent these last months
in New York trying to find my way.


1270
01:37:34.828 --> 01:37:36.830
Maybe that is all any of us do.

1271
01:37:38.498 --> 01:37:40.709
I look forward to discussing
these things with you, Dad.


1272
01:37:42.002 --> 01:37:44.046
It is high time we
got to know each other.

1273
01:37:45.881 --> 01:37:48.675
Love, Barack."

1274
01:38:59.496 --> 01:39:00.372
Hey.

1275
01:39:02.416 --> 01:39:03.125
You wanna play Horse?

1276
01:39:03.625 --> 01:39:05.794
-Sure.
-You can shoot first.


1277
01:39:09.298 --> 01:39:10.757
Oh, okay.

1278
01:39:12.592 --> 01:39:14.344
Woo! Nice one.

1279
01:39:24.021 --> 01:39:24.771
I got an H.

1280
01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.485
-Right here.
-Okay. [laughs]


1281
01:39:33.113 --> 01:39:36.366
Pretty good. Good. Guess I'm up.

1282
01:39:40.454 --> 01:39:41.496
Where you from?

1283
01:39:42.206 --> 01:39:46.918
-Riverside. How 'bout you?
-I'm from a lot of places.


1284
01:39:47.002 --> 01:39:49.546
But I... I live here now.

1285
