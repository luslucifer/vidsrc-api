1
00:00:04.468 --> 00:00:07.635
How are you today, Lou?

2
00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:14.510
Ah, that arm is healing up nicely
but see that you've been


3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.385
damaging your other arm.

4
00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.676
that won't do, 
Lou, that won't do

5
00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:26.301
I, uh, can't help but
notice you're still here


6
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:31.010
You haven't left our humble
establishment to uh...


7
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.010
Rule The Earth.

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.010
Oh, I will, just you watch...
I will.


9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.301
Sure you will, Lou.

10
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.301
Sure you will.

11
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.926
Tell me about last night's
dream.


12
00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:43.093
It started with a Fat Guy.

13
00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:23.926
Well Shit.

14
00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.676
I think, I think we blew a
goddamn belt


15
00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:29.426
Hey, I gotta take a piss.

16
00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:32.010
Well go get your goddamn
piss.


17
00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:39.176
Well, well, well...

18
00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:41.968
What a day, what a day.

19
00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:02.635
What the fuck is going on?

20
00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:05.010
Well, you see, the official version

21
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.385
is that I broke a belt

22
00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:08.760
And then...

23
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.760
I heroically...

24
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.801
stopped you from escaping.

25
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.926
Why are you doing this?

26
00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.801
Well, you see...

27
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:18.968
Master Ambrose

28
00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:22.426
He gave me a long list of
whereto's and whatfor's


29
00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:27.135
And it is a long list because
he is a wordy motherfucker


30
00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:29.551
But, what it all boils down to

31
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.760
is a fat man had to die.

32
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.718
So, if you could get out in
an orderly fashion


33
00:02:37.718 --> 00:02:40.635
And then say...

34
00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:45.385
run for 20 feet in that direction,
in a straight line of course


35
00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:47.843
I'd consider it a kindness.

36
00:02:52.593 --> 00:03:00.760
What exactly did I do to piss
off what was it? MASTER Ambrose?


37
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.760
Shit son, I don't know.

38
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.385
It ain't like Master Ambrose
and I have cookies and tea, y'see?


39
00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:11.010
If it makes you feel any better...

40
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.385
I take no pleasure

41
00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.093
in any of this.

42
00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.885
Well, at least you're all shook
up about it.


43
00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.135
I'm all broke up, boo.

44
00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.093
FUCK, my ball sac!!!!!

45
00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:27.968
What the fuck?

46
00:03:27.968 --> 00:03:28.968
What the fuck?

47
00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:31.926
Fucking hell

48
00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:32.926
What the fuck?

49
00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:33.926
Fuck, what the fuck?

50
00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:35.843
You need to stop right
there sugar britches.


51
00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:37.010
(urgent guitar

52
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.385
Point that thing
away from me.


53
00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.301
I don't want you to
get nervous


54
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.176
and do something stupid.
Take your finger off the trigger.


55
00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:45.885
Now, real slow
I want you to


56
00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:46.885
pump those
shotgun shells out


57
00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:47.885
of that scattergun

58
00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:48.885
You understand?

59
00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:49.885
Yeah.

60
00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:50.885
Nice and slow.

61
00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:52.635
You're new at this aren't you?

62
00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:53.635
Yeah.

63
00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:55.635
What the fuck?

64
00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.301
WHAT THE FUCK?

65
00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:59.593
what the fuck?

66
00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:00.968
Go ahead and put the
gun down.


67
00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:02.801
Put it down...
SLOW.


68
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:04.635
SLOW.

69
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:08.051
Now, back away.

70
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:10.051
Easy.

71
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:11.801
Now, you see what
I did to your buddy?

72
00:04:13.218 --> 00:04:15.468
You do something stupid, that's going to
be you too, you understand?


73
00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:16.468
No......no.

74
00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:18.676
You got a key on you?

75
00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:19.051
Yeah.

76
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:20.051
A handcuff key?

77
00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:22.718
All right, you're going to come over here.

78
00:04:22.718 --> 00:04:24.176
Uncuf one of these cuffs

79
00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:25.551
Okay

80
00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:26.968
You do this right, you can live.

81
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.343
I had nothing to do with this.

82
00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:30.968
I... uh....

83
00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:32.635
I got a wife and kids, man.

84
00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:33.635
So, did I.

85
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.926
Back up.

86
00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:40.926
On the road.

87
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.510
Look

88
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.510
He was a piece of shit.

89
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.510
I... I...

90
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.510
didn't think he would do
anything like this


91
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.510
I...

92
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.260
Look, look, I just had to
take a piss.


93
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.426
I swear, I'll tell everbody the truth

94
00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:56.135
You're going to tell everbody
the truth


95
00:04:57.135 --> 00:04:58.135
Now turnaround

96
00:04:58.135 --> 00:04:59.135
Count to 100.

97
00:04:59.135 --> 00:05:00.218
Walk in that direction.

98
00:05:00.218 --> 00:05:01.218
You turn around

99
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.218
That's it.

100
00:05:03.218 --> 00:05:04.218
You're done.

101
00:05:04.218 --> 00:05:05.385
GO.
One...


102
00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:06.843
two.

103
00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:08.843
three

104
00:05:08.843 --> 00:05:09.843
four

105
00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:10.843
five

106
00:05:11.843 --> 00:05:12.843
six.

107
00:05:12.843 --> 00:05:13.843
Seven...

108
00:05:13.843 --> 00:05:14.843
eight

109
00:05:14.843 --> 00:05:15.843
nine

110
00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:18.385
ten

111
00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:19.385
eleven

112
00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.968
twelve

113
00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:21.968
KEEP WALKING!

114
00:05:21.968 --> 00:05:22.968
Thirteen

115
00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:24.260
fourteen

116
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.260
fifteen

117
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.260
sixteen

118
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:36.801
Excuse me?

119
00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:41.385
EXCUSE ME?

120
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:47.426
Sheriff don't take kindly to having his
nap interrupted.


121
00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:48.426
Oh.

122
00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:51.260
I don't give a flying fuck what he
takes kindly to


123
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.926
And are you seriously smoking narcotics
in front of a Federal Officer?


124
00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.551
No.

125
00:05:57.551 --> 00:05:59.510
Jesus Christ.

126
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:02.551
Get up

127
00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:04.801
and get your boss

128
00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:06.218
NOW!

129
00:06:06.218 --> 00:06:09.176
Nobody orders the Sheriff around.

130
00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:11.468
Well, I believe I just did.

131
00:06:11.468 --> 00:06:14.968
So, why don't you get your fucking
in bred ass out of my way


132
00:06:14.968 --> 00:06:17.260
Or, I will break your goddamn chicken
neck with my thighs


133
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.051
And, you will NOT enjoy it.

134
00:06:19.051 --> 00:06:22.885
Well... I don't know about that.

135
00:06:22.885 --> 00:06:24.301
Useless.

136
00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:25.301
HEY!

137
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.801
Wake up you backwater excuse
for law enforcement.


138
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:28.801
Let's go.

139
00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:30.343
A Woman??

140
00:06:30.343 --> 00:06:32.551
Well goddamn.

141
00:06:32.551 --> 00:06:35.760
I could have sworn by the way
you walked in here, you were all man


142
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.718
What did you fucking say to me?

143
00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:39.718
Well honey,

144
00:06:39.718 --> 00:06:41.343
If I've learned one thing

145
00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:43.551
its if it walks like a bull

146
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:45.510
and it talks like a bull

147
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.551
No matter how pretty it is

148
00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:51.801
there's gotta be a set of balls swinging
around them pretty little thighs.


149
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:53.926
What can I do for you?

150
00:06:53.926 --> 00:06:57.843
I am here, looking for an escaped
convict.


151
00:06:57.843 --> 00:06:59.885
Oh hey, ya'll let another one go?

152
00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:04.343
NO, the department of corrections let
another one go and I intend on finding him.


153
00:07:04.343 --> 00:07:06.135
Do you now?

154
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.176
I reckon we all need goals.

155
00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:10.968
It's MY JOB.

156
00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:14.135
Tennessee's got a job too

157
00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:15.551
He cleans the shitters

158
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.010
He has been up my ass for a
promotion, I tell you what.


159
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.968
Do you see this goddamn badge?

160
00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:23.593
I'm a US Deputy Marshall

161
00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:25.468
and I require your assistance.

162
00:07:25.468 --> 00:07:26.468
Well honey,

163
00:07:26.468 --> 00:07:28.426
You might as well wish in one hand

164
00:07:28.426 --> 00:07:31.551
and shit in the other and
tell me which one fills up first.


165
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:35.218
Are you seriously refusing to
assist the Federal Government?


166
00:07:35.218 --> 00:07:38.301
Oh, you mean the bastards that
coddle and hug these criminals?


167
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:39.301
No.

168
00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:43.135
I mean those bastards who help
pay for this godforsaken town


169
00:07:43.135 --> 00:07:46.135
with grants and tax subsidies...
SO.


170
00:07:46.135 --> 00:07:49.010
Get your fucking ass up

171
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.718
and get me a goddamn map

172
00:07:50.718 --> 00:07:53.676
I need to know where he might be
hiding or where he might go


173
00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:56.260
So, if anyone has heard of any breakins

174
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.635
or burgleries

175
00:07:57.635 --> 00:07:59.968
And, what fucking fresh hell
is this?


176
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:05.176
Special Agent Duane Delmont
Federal Bureau of Investigation


177
00:08:05.176 --> 00:08:07.343
This is my partner
Dwayne Dellmont


178
00:08:08.968 --> 00:08:09.968
You boys twins?

179
00:08:09.968 --> 00:08:11.676
No sir. No relation.

180
00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:16.801
Look, you boys need to get in line Because
I am looking for an escaped convict.


181
00:08:16.801 --> 00:08:18.843
Uh, we're working a kidnapping.

182
00:08:18.843 --> 00:08:20.510
I'm afraid our case takes precedence.

183
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.926
The girl has been missing for

184
00:08:22.926 --> 00:08:25.260
seventeen minutes.

185
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.301
Damn its uh...

186
00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:28.551
gotta be embarrassing.

187
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:29.551
To get all dressed up

188
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:30.551
and uh

189
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:33.801
two other gals show up with the
same shit you got on.


190
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.301
Sweetie.

191
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:41.801
I'm so glad you're home.

192
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:44.426
I missed you.

193
00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:46.593
Ahhh, sugar.

194
00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:50.260
I missed you too.

195
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:56.718
It was a long day at the office.

196
00:08:56.718 --> 00:09:01.218
How was your day?

197
00:09:01.218 --> 00:09:02.718
Busy

198
00:09:04.635 --> 00:09:06.926
I had to clean the play room.

199
00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:10.010
You forgot to walk her before
you left this morning.


200
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.010
Ohhh, hunny.

201
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.885
Sorry, I forgot to walk that
bitch this morning.


202
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.510
It won't happen again.

203
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.385
It wasn't a problem.

204
00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:28.718
Did my brother stop by?

205
00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:29.718
Yes.

206
00:09:29.718 --> 00:09:32.718
And did you do everything he
needed done?


207
00:09:32.718 --> 00:09:35.218
Of course.

208
00:09:35.218 --> 00:09:37.468
Otis needed help twice.

209
00:09:40.468 --> 00:09:44.593
I figured you two could discuss
that later.


210
00:09:44.593 --> 00:09:47.218
Good Girl.

211
00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:59.176
Daddy's tired.

212
00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:06.176
I think I'll go to the playroom
and housebreak that bad girl.


213
00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:08.926
Dinner's going to be ready in
a half an hour.


214
00:10:08.926 --> 00:10:10.343
Perfect

215
00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:18.593
Hello, little girl.

216
00:10:18.593 --> 00:10:21.760
I'm here.

217
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.010
Daddy's home.

218
00:10:31.426 --> 00:10:33.843
I hear you had a little accident.

219
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.260
No, that's not good.

220
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.926
You've been a bad, bad girl.

221
00:10:44.926 --> 00:10:50.176
Fuck... that bitch bit me.

222
00:10:51.176 --> 00:10:53.968
Master Ambrose shore does pay well.

223
00:10:54.968 --> 00:10:56.968
DID YOU SAY AMBROSE?

224
00:10:56.968 --> 00:10:57.968
Who the fuck are you?"

225
00:10:57.968 --> 00:11:02.801
Did you say....Ambrose?"

226
00:11:07.926 --> 00:11:08.926
FUCK!

227
00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:27.635
You can't hit shit, you fat fuck!

228
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.968
Can I interest you in some primo meth?

229
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.260
What are you doing this Tuesday?

230
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:38.135
I can make Tuesday work.

231
00:12:38.135 --> 00:12:39.760
You serious?

232
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.760
You'll marry me on Tuesday?

233
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.843
Cause I was... I had this
whole thing


234
00:12:44.843 --> 00:12:45.843
YES.

235
00:12:45.843 --> 00:12:47.385
Yes, yes, yes.

236
00:12:47.385 --> 00:12:49.551
Uh....

237
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:51.135
This is funny.

238
00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:53.843
I had something I wanted to tell
you too.


239
00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:58.801
Well, my news obviously wins

240
00:12:58.801 --> 00:13:00.426
You know, cuz....

241
00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:02.760
This beautiful dame just agreed
to marry me.


242
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.176
Can you believe that?

243
00:13:04.176 --> 00:13:06.176
Well, THIS Dame...

244
00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:08.718
Is also pregnant.

245
00:13:09.718 --> 00:13:10.718
I... uh... uh...

246
00:13:10.718 --> 00:13:12.718
UH....

247
00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:14.343
You can speak.

248
00:13:14.343 --> 00:13:16.093
It's allowed.

249
00:13:20.343 --> 00:13:21.635
You're going to be a Daddy.

250
00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:22.635
Huh....

251
00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.343
Tuesday?

252
00:13:25.343 --> 00:13:28.301
No, we have a few months
left for that.


253
00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:33.551
What the hell man...
what did we ever do to you?


254
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:36.301
Not a goddamn thing.

255
00:13:36.301 --> 00:13:39.510
But you work for Ambrose.

256
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.010
And, I need to send a message.

257
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.593
Fuck you.

258
00:13:44.593 --> 00:13:46.593
You know, that looks pretty bad.

259
00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:49.510
Might want to get someone
to take a look at that.


260
00:13:52.843 --> 00:13:54.968
You know, if you live
long enough.


261
00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:58.260
You should go tell Ambrose
that death is coming.


262
00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:04.926
On second thought.

263
00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:06.760
I'll tell him myself.

264
00:14:09.635 --> 00:14:11.926
And then he destroyed my
final minion.


265
00:14:11.926 --> 00:14:15.343
Well, it looks like you're running
out of minions there, Lou.


266
00:14:15.343 --> 00:14:17.843
Stupid Fucking Game.

267
00:14:17.843 --> 00:14:20.551
Uh... em...

268
00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:23.260
I'll just....

269
00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.260
THERE!

270
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.676
I WON!

271
00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:30.676
Now, Lou... all games have rules.

272
00:14:30.676 --> 00:14:32.718
Rules are for losers.

273
00:14:32.718 --> 00:14:33.718
Ask him about Uz.

274
00:14:33.718 --> 00:14:35.593
Tell that to the man from Uz.

275
00:14:35.593 --> 00:14:37.301
That's right.

276
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.801
You're the evil one.

277
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:40.218
Beezelbub

278
00:14:40.218 --> 00:14:42.385
Abbadon, destroyer of worlds.

279
00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:44.176
Don't get cute, Doc.

280
00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:46.593
Those guys are all amateurs.
I'm Lucifer.


281
00:14:46.593 --> 00:14:47.593
Ahhh...

282
00:14:47.593 --> 00:14:48.593
I forgot.

283
00:14:49.593 --> 00:14:52.135
Tell me about Job, Lou.

284
00:14:52.135 --> 00:14:55.176
I made a deal with God.

285
00:14:55.176 --> 00:14:58.135
I bet that I could turn Job
away from God.


286
00:14:58.135 --> 00:15:01.801
Hmmm, God won that wager
If I recall.


287
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:05.301
But, at a might steep price
I still got my pound of flesh.


288
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:07.093
Sure you did Lou.

289
00:15:07.093 --> 00:15:09.093
Sure you did.

290
00:15:15.218 --> 00:15:16.926
Are you questioning my powers?

291
00:15:16.926 --> 00:15:19.468
Tell you what.

292
00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:22.176
Strike me down.

293
00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.426
Go ahead. I'll wait.

294
00:15:29.426 --> 00:15:30.426
Huh?

295
00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:31.426
Eh.

296
00:15:31.426 --> 00:15:32.426
Hmmm.

297
00:15:36.093 --> 00:15:38.218
It doesn't work like that.

298
00:15:38.218 --> 00:15:39.926
Of course it doesn't.

299
00:15:39.926 --> 00:15:41.676
So, what happened next?

300
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.510
Hey!

301
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.385
Look, I already gave my statement

302
00:15:50.385 --> 00:15:53.010
and they already yelled at me
and handed me my walking papers.


303
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.843
You were the one driving
the convict?


304
00:15:54.843 --> 00:15:56.968
No, I was riding shotgun.

305
00:15:56.968 --> 00:15:59.676
We were on a long stretch
of road.


306
00:15:59.676 --> 00:16:01.885
And my partner was giving
me water


307
00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:04.135
we missed the last bathroom
for a 60 mile stretch.


308
00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:07.218
I just had to go, take a piss.

309
00:16:07.218 --> 00:16:10.551
I had no idea that he
would try and kill the convict.


310
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:12.176
WHAT?

311
00:16:12.176 --> 00:16:13.176
Yeah, my partner was

312
00:16:13.176 --> 00:16:14.176
paid by someone

313
00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:15.176
to kill the convict.

314
00:16:17.093 --> 00:16:18.093
That is not what the Sheriff

315
00:16:18.093 --> 00:16:19.093
or the Department

316
00:16:19.093 --> 00:16:20.093
of Corrections told me.

317
00:16:20.093 --> 00:16:21.093
Of course not

318
00:16:21.093 --> 00:16:22.635
they're all on the same payroll

319
00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.051
Why are you telling me this?

320
00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:27.051
I promised the fat man

321
00:16:27.051 --> 00:16:28.885
that I would tell the truth.

322
00:16:28.885 --> 00:16:30.635
And I intend on doing just that.

323
00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:33.926
So, he didn't violently escape?

324
00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.926
Oh, it was violent already but

325
00:16:35.926 --> 00:16:38.926
it was self defense
pure and simple.


326
00:16:38.926 --> 00:16:40.926
But, he did kill other

327
00:16:40.926 --> 00:16:42.635
convicts at his previous prison?

328
00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:44.968
Yeah, but only after they
jumped him.


329
00:16:46.676 --> 00:16:47.885
He killed them all at once?

330
00:16:47.885 --> 00:16:49.801
Yeah.

331
00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:51.218
The paperwork says,

332
00:16:51.218 --> 00:16:52.218
that he killed five

333
00:16:52.218 --> 00:16:53.510
other convicts

334
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.551
over several months.

335
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:57.593
No, it was all at the same time.

336
00:16:57.593 --> 00:16:58.593
I was there.

337
00:16:58.593 --> 00:17:00.093
He killed them in the shower

338
00:17:00.093 --> 00:17:01.593
with just a goddamn bar of soap.

339
00:17:01.593 --> 00:17:02.593
There were a lot of

340
00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:03.593
naked body parts

341
00:17:03.593 --> 00:17:04.593
that I had to pick up

342
00:17:04.593 --> 00:17:07.468
I transferred to transpo the
next day.


343
00:17:07.468 --> 00:17:08.468
You can only handle

344
00:17:08.468 --> 00:17:09.468
so many uh

345
00:17:09.468 --> 00:17:10.468
severed

346
00:17:10.468 --> 00:17:11.468
members

347
00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:12.468
before its time to rethink

348
00:17:12.468 --> 00:17:14.218
your career trajectory.

349
00:17:14.218 --> 00:17:16.676
Probably a good idea.

350
00:17:18.301 --> 00:17:20.093
Did he mention where
he was going?


351
00:17:20.093 --> 00:17:21.426
No offense, lady

352
00:17:21.426 --> 00:17:22.426
when a fatman is

353
00:17:22.426 --> 00:17:23.426
holding a shotgun to your head

354
00:17:23.426 --> 00:17:24.426
its really not time to

355
00:17:24.426 --> 00:17:25.801
ask him his evening plans.

356
00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:27.676
ANYTHING?

357
00:17:27.676 --> 00:17:30.676
He didn't say anything.

358
00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:32.676
Just between you and me

359
00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:33.676
Mayor Ambrose pays a lot of

360
00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:35.260
the bills around here

361
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.301
if you catch my drift?

362
00:17:37.301 --> 00:17:38.301
I know for a fact that

363
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:39.301
my partner did some

364
00:17:39.301 --> 00:17:41.676
off hours odd jobs for him.

365
00:17:41.676 --> 00:17:42.676
The mayor?

366
00:17:42.676 --> 00:17:45.343
You say mayor.

367
00:17:45.343 --> 00:17:46.801
We say God.

368
00:17:46.801 --> 00:17:48.635
But, you didn't hear that from me.

369
00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:50.635
Thanks.

370
00:17:53.635 --> 00:17:55.218
What the fuck am I gonna do?

371
00:17:55.218 --> 00:17:56.218
My Daddy told me to

372
00:17:56.218 --> 00:17:57.635
be a cop, be a cop he said

373
00:17:57.635 --> 00:17:59.135
GOD.....DAMMIT

374
00:18:02.135 --> 00:18:04.468
Well, this here's the Harlan house.

375
00:18:04.468 --> 00:18:08.510
So...

376
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.301
You know they have
a door, right?


377
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:14.426
I ain't allowed on
the porch.


378
00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.176
That's fair.

379
00:18:18.968 --> 00:18:20.593
What the hell are you
doing here?


380
00:18:20.593 --> 00:18:21.593
Now, Arthur, I'm just

381
00:18:21.593 --> 00:18:23.135
here to deliver the feds.

382
00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:24.135
The Feds?

383
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:27.426
Special Agent Duane Dellmont

384
00:18:27.426 --> 00:18:30.010
this is my partner Special Agent
Dwayne Delmont


385
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.260
Ya'll related?

386
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.468
No relation, sir.

387
00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:36.301
Well, what can I do for you?

388
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:38.510
May we come in, sir?

389
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.635
Yeah, ya'll are welcome but

390
00:18:40.635 --> 00:18:43.885
leave the local fucknut
ARTHUR!


391
00:18:43.885 --> 00:18:45.843
Leave the retard on the porch.

392
00:18:45.843 --> 00:18:46.843
ARTHUR!

393
00:18:46.843 --> 00:18:50.343
Leave the special needs student
on the porch.


394
00:18:50.343 --> 00:18:52.051
Bettah!

395
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:53.885
Again, that seems perfectly fair.

396
00:18:53.885 --> 00:18:55.635
Thank you Deputy.

397
00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:56.635
Yeah.

398
00:19:06.176 --> 00:19:07.176
OWWW!

399
00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:08.468
I ain't a

400
00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:10.676
GODDAMN retard.

401
00:19:10.676 --> 00:19:12.093
Your granddaughter has been
missing for...


402
00:19:12.093 --> 00:19:15.260
45 hours and 12 minutes.

403
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.885
THAT WE KNOW OF.

404
00:19:16.885 --> 00:19:20.093
That's when we first called it in
to the local fucknuts.


405
00:19:20.468 --> 00:19:21.468
Local law enforcement.

406
00:19:21.468 --> 00:19:24.385
How long had she been missing
before that?


407
00:19:24.385 --> 00:19:26.301
She left for classes.

408
00:19:26.301 --> 00:19:27.301
Uh...

409
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:28.843
She's a theology student.

410
00:19:28.843 --> 00:19:29.843
At the university.

411
00:19:29.843 --> 00:19:32.010
Near the top of her class.

412
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.801
Was she unhappy?

413
00:19:33.801 --> 00:19:35.593
Not at all.

414
00:19:35.593 --> 00:19:37.051
Any enemies?

415
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:40.093
Of course not, she's
a young woman.


416
00:19:40.093 --> 00:19:41.093
Ma'am

417
00:19:41.093 --> 00:19:43.301
in our experience age doesn't matter.

418
00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:45.426
Anyone who might want to
do her harm?


419
00:19:45.426 --> 00:19:46.426
Angry boyfriends?

420
00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:47.426
No but we did have a

421
00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:50.010
breakin here about 4 days ago.

422
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.593
Why didn't you call it in?

423
00:19:51.593 --> 00:19:53.260
Is that what they told you?

424
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.718
I did call it in.

425
00:19:54.718 --> 00:19:57.093
Sheriff Bojangles and Deputy Fucknuts

426
00:19:57.093 --> 00:19:58.551
told me it probably wasn't anything.

427
00:19:58.551 --> 00:19:59.551
ARTHUR!

428
00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:01.718
Estelle!

429
00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:03.135
I love you.

430
00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:05.718
45 years of matrimonial bliss

431
00:20:05.718 --> 00:20:07.593
with you, but I swear to God

432
00:20:07.593 --> 00:20:09.176
if you correct my accurate

433
00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:11.093
portrayal of that idiot one more time

434
00:20:11.093 --> 00:20:13.885
It ain't mean, if its true.

435
00:20:13.885 --> 00:20:16.135
There is a polite way

436
00:20:16.135 --> 00:20:17.801
and an impolite way

437
00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:20.051
to call someone a fuckin' idiot.

438
00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:22.551
And you don't call that fucktard

439
00:20:22.551 --> 00:20:23.551
a fuckin' idiot in front

440
00:20:23.551 --> 00:20:26.385
of strangers even if he is
a wicked fucktard.


441
00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:27.385
Ma'am

442
00:20:27.385 --> 00:20:29.593
if we could focus.

443
00:20:29.593 --> 00:20:32.218
The fucking idiot said?

444
00:20:32.218 --> 00:20:33.218
She said, fucktard.

445
00:20:33.218 --> 00:20:35.510
Thank you, my mistake.

446
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.093
They came out, told me

447
00:20:37.093 --> 00:20:40.051
kids or animals, or

448
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:43.301
Look, ain't no animal leaving
a size 12 boot print.


449
00:20:43.301 --> 00:20:44.301
Did you see them?

450
00:20:44.301 --> 00:20:47.218
Uh... no, but the neighbors did.

451
00:20:47.218 --> 00:20:48.968
Wonderful people.

452
00:20:48.968 --> 00:20:49.968
Lutherans.

453
00:20:49.968 --> 00:20:52.385
But, we can forgive that
indiscretion.


454
00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:53.385
Ma'am.

455
00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:56.260
They described a group
of gang members


456
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.093
Gang members?

457
00:20:59.093 --> 00:21:01.760
Yeah, we got us a bunch
of kids who think


458
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.551
their pants shouldn't fit

459
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:05.385
driving around all tough

460
00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:06.760
and inner city hard while

461
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.843
they're driving past cow pastures.

462
00:21:08.843 --> 00:21:10.968
You know, I used to act tough too

463
00:21:10.968 --> 00:21:12.301
driving past cow pastures

464
00:21:12.301 --> 00:21:13.885
except mine were in Nam!

465
00:21:13.885 --> 00:21:15.676
Oh, you were in Nam?

466
00:21:15.676 --> 00:21:17.968
Do you have any description
beyond that?


467
00:21:17.968 --> 00:21:19.510
Well, yeah.

468
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.218
Neighbor said they all kinda
looked alike


469
00:21:22.218 --> 00:21:24.010
like they could be brothers.

470
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.093
I know where they live
if it helps.


471
00:21:26.093 --> 00:21:28.510
Wait, you know where they live?

472
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.468
Well, it is a small town.

473
00:21:30.468 --> 00:21:33.010
Sheriff told me to... stay away.

474
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.551
And I've been doing that.

475
00:21:34.551 --> 00:21:36.010
But, I swear to God, if they had

476
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.010
anything to do with this

477
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.051
I will SHOW them what I
learned in Viet-NAM.


478
00:21:40.051 --> 00:21:43.468
All right, that's all the questions
we have right now.


479
00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:45.301
Thank you both for your time.

480
00:21:45.301 --> 00:21:46.301
Semper Fi.

481
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:47.301
Do or Die.

482
00:21:47.301 --> 00:21:49.176
Semper Fi, boys.

483
00:21:49.176 --> 00:21:50.176
You bring her home.

484
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.176
She'll come back, right?

485
00:22:04.718 --> 00:22:07.760
Well, at least we have some
professionals on the job now.


486
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.718
Instead of the wonder twins
of ineptitude.


487
00:22:10.718 --> 00:22:12.010
It's dinner time.

488
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.301
I caught me some road kill.

489
00:22:14.301 --> 00:22:15.843
Think I need to teach him a

490
00:22:15.843 --> 00:22:18.176
thing or two about talking to outsiders

491
00:22:19.176 --> 00:22:20.176
Did he learn?

492
00:22:20.176 --> 00:22:22.093
Well, he ain't talkin'.

493
00:22:22.093 --> 00:22:24.801
I say it's a lesson he won't
soon forget.


494
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.510
Well, we still gonna do

495
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.218
this here ritual tomorrow night?

496
00:22:32.218 --> 00:22:34.468
Well, it is the blood moon.

497
00:22:34.468 --> 00:22:35.468
Why?

498
00:22:35.468 --> 00:22:37.968
You growing attached to
your little toy?


499
00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:40.801
She is fresh.

500
00:22:40.801 --> 00:22:42.593
Heh... she still screams

501
00:22:42.593 --> 00:22:44.385
when you mishandle her.

502
00:22:45.385 --> 00:22:46.260
Well...

503
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.843
It can't be your wife

504
00:22:47.843 --> 00:22:50.176
She's already over 21.

505
00:22:50.176 --> 00:22:53.968
The sacrifice has to be
a woman under 20 years.


506
00:22:53.968 --> 00:22:56.385
You know the scripture
as well as I do.


507
00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:58.385
Wait... we

508
00:22:58.385 --> 00:23:00.801
could snatch you another but,

509
00:23:00.801 --> 00:23:03.635
The Feds are starting
to sniff around.


510
00:23:03.635 --> 00:23:07.301
No, that's fine.

511
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:08.593
We'll just put this bitch

512
00:23:08.593 --> 00:23:09.593
out of her misery

513
00:23:09.593 --> 00:23:10.593
and then I'll get a new one

514
00:23:10.593 --> 00:23:13.218
when the Feds aren't around.

515
00:23:13.218 --> 00:23:15.218
Or, maybe Lucifer will get me

516
00:23:15.218 --> 00:23:17.510
a new one, kinda as a reward?

517
00:23:19.093 --> 00:23:22.135
You sure you won't stay?
I made pleny.


518
00:23:22.135 --> 00:23:23.593
Even baked some bread.

519
00:23:23.593 --> 00:23:24.593
No, I better get back

520
00:23:24.593 --> 00:23:25.593
to my toy

521
00:23:25.593 --> 00:23:26.593
while I still

522
00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:27.593
have her.

523
00:23:28.593 --> 00:23:31.301
Don't overcook those ribs.

524
00:23:33.051 --> 00:23:37.968
There are some things
you can say to me, brother.


525
00:23:37.968 --> 00:23:41.426
Insulting my ribs is
a touch too far.


526
00:23:41.426 --> 00:23:44.551
Well, you gotta eat 'em.

527
00:23:44.551 --> 00:23:46.926
Whatever makes you happy, brother.

528
00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.385
Makes me happy.

529
00:24:03.551 --> 00:24:05.468
Can you believe that?

530
00:24:05.468 --> 00:24:07.260
He had the affrontery

531
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.510
to comment on my ribs... well,

532
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.551
your ribs.

533
00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:13.718
That's just downright rude.

534
00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:17.218
Awww

535
00:24:17.218 --> 00:24:20.343
I think your ribs will be just fine.

536
00:24:20.343 --> 00:24:22.593
May I ask where your crime
scene unit is?


537
00:24:22.593 --> 00:24:25.010
Did you hear that Tennessee?

538
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.593
Federalis want to know where
the crime scene unit is?


539
00:24:28.593 --> 00:24:30.760
Crime scene unit... that's
funny boss.


540
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.635
Why is that funny?

541
00:24:32.635 --> 00:24:35.968
You're in Appalachia County
now boy.


542
00:24:35.968 --> 00:24:37.510
We are the crime scene unit.

543
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.718
We've got a deputy marshall
out there


544
00:24:39.718 --> 00:24:42.051
with the finest ass you ever did see.

545
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:44.051
She's on the job.

546
00:24:44.051 --> 00:24:46.593
Did you just call my partner, boy?

547
00:24:46.593 --> 00:24:48.343
Aw hell

548
00:24:48.343 --> 00:24:50.426
It's just a term of endearment
around here.


549
00:24:50.426 --> 00:24:52.176
For colored boys.

550
00:24:52.176 --> 00:24:54.051
Term of endearment
that's funny boss.


551
00:24:54.051 --> 00:24:56.718
Bet your kind used to call
slavery, having house guests.


552
00:24:56.718 --> 00:24:58.385
Oh, hell yeah.

553
00:24:58.385 --> 00:24:59.385
With benefits.

554
00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:03.801
I will cheerfully take your
racist ass outside.


555
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:06.426
What are you gonna do?
Assault an officer?


556
00:25:08.843 --> 00:25:11.051
What do you know?

557
00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:12.760
Well, it was bloody.

558
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.551
Any sign of the girl?

559
00:25:18.176 --> 00:25:20.551
That's right, you boys are looking
for a girl.


560
00:25:20.551 --> 00:25:22.551
I hate to break it to you hoss

561
00:25:22.551 --> 00:25:25.510
All the body parts we found
were male.


562
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.760
Were they all brothers?

563
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.218
What you trying to say?

564
00:25:29.218 --> 00:25:31.260
All us white boys look alike?

565
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.260
Uh...

566
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.093
Its a term of endearment, deputy.

567
00:25:40.718 --> 00:25:42.426
How many people did this?

568
00:25:42.426 --> 00:25:46.093
A witness said it was a
fat guy with a shotgun.


569
00:25:46.093 --> 00:25:48.301
Aw hell no...

570
00:25:48.301 --> 00:25:50.385
I don't reckon we have
witnesses around these parts.


571
00:25:50.385 --> 00:25:51.926
Oh, well that's cute.

572
00:25:51.926 --> 00:25:55.176
The witness says you haven't
got any cops around these parts.


573
00:25:55.176 --> 00:25:57.218
WHO SAID THAT?

574
00:25:57.218 --> 00:25:59.010
Tell me where they are
and we're


575
00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.260
we're going to take care of dem.

576
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.135
All right, Tennessee.

577
00:26:02.135 --> 00:26:04.135
Do you gentleman want to

578
00:26:04.135 --> 00:26:08.260
take this conversation where its
a little bit less....


579
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.260
stupid.

580
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.510
Uh... yes... please.

581
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.010
What kind of uppity

582
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.468
yankee bullshit, is that?

583
00:26:17.468 --> 00:26:18.468
Yeah.

584
00:26:18.468 --> 00:26:22.135
Tell you what though, with an ass like
that, its hard to hate that bitch.


585
00:26:22.135 --> 00:26:23.135
Yeah well,

586
00:26:23.135 --> 00:26:25.010
she probably reminds you
of your Mom too.


587
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.551
My Mom?

588
00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:27.760
Boy, whatchyu know about
my Mom?


589
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.760
Nothin'.

590
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.385
Nope, nothin' nope.

591
00:26:30.385 --> 00:26:32.760
So, the shooter matches
my guy's description.


592
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.468
But, the bodies are the ones
who apparently took your girl.


593
00:26:36.468 --> 00:26:37.968
How do you know that?

594
00:26:37.968 --> 00:26:39.343
WELLLLL.....

595
00:26:39.343 --> 00:26:41.551
I managed to swipe these

596
00:26:41.551 --> 00:26:44.510
before that sheriff even decided to
mosey on up to the crime scene.


597
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.885
Wait, you took these off of an
active crime scene?


598
00:26:46.885 --> 00:26:48.760
What? SERIOUSLY?

599
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.843
You going to bitch at me for
contaminating their crime scene?


600
00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:54.926
Uh, no deputy, just impressed.

601
00:26:54.926 --> 00:26:57.468
We should team up.

602
00:26:57.468 --> 00:26:58.468
Pool our resources.

603
00:26:58.468 --> 00:27:01.510
Ignore the inept locals?

604
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.635
Uh, they call them fucking
idiots here.


605
00:27:03.635 --> 00:27:06.093
Actually, its fucktards.

606
00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:09.093
It's a term of endearment.

607
00:27:10.843 --> 00:27:11.843
Is that a yes?

608
00:27:12.843 --> 00:27:14.135
You have a deal.

609
00:27:14.135 --> 00:27:17.176
Okay then.

610
00:27:20.885 --> 00:27:24.093
A King belongs in his castle.

611
00:27:24.093 --> 00:27:28.468
Now Lou, not every powerful
man is a King.


612
00:27:28.468 --> 00:27:30.135
No, but you haven't head of a

613
00:27:30.135 --> 00:27:32.718
King paying child support and
eating dog food either.


614
00:27:32.718 --> 00:27:34.301
Preach it, BROTHER!

615
00:27:43.676 --> 00:27:46.593
You may enter.

616
00:27:50.885 --> 00:27:52.385
Oh look, honey.

617
00:27:52.385 --> 00:27:55.468
It's our local sheriff.

618
00:27:55.468 --> 00:27:59.135
And to what do we owe this
honor this evening, sheriff?


619
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:01.510
Is it time for another charitable

620
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.635
contribution to the local law enforcement
doesy-do?


621
00:28:05.635 --> 00:28:10.260
You got yourself a problem.

622
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.843
And that problem would be?

623
00:28:12.843 --> 00:28:16.010
You got a fat guy out there
killing all your boys.


624
00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:23.676
GOOOOOD!

625
00:28:23.676 --> 00:28:25.176
That's good?

626
00:28:25.176 --> 00:28:29.051
Walk with me Sheriff.

627
00:28:30.051 --> 00:28:32.135
Did you just sass me?

628
00:28:32.135 --> 00:28:33.135
No darling.

629
00:28:33.135 --> 00:28:35.468
My back was just hurting...
a little.


630
00:28:35.468 --> 00:28:37.135
I'm sorry.

631
00:28:37.135 --> 00:28:38.135
Are you sure?

632
00:28:38.135 --> 00:28:39.551
Baby I would never-

633
00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.093
Goddamn right.

634
00:28:41.093 --> 00:28:43.301
Now, you just sit there
and look pretty.


635
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.093
Now...

636
00:28:49.093 --> 00:28:52.051
there's some questions that
you have, I bet.


637
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:53.676
Yeah, I got a few.

638
00:28:59.593 --> 00:29:02.218
Awwww

639
00:29:02.218 --> 00:29:05.635
you taste good, child.

640
00:29:05.635 --> 00:29:07.551
Ya all right sheriff?

641
00:29:07.551 --> 00:29:09.593
I'm fine.

642
00:29:09.593 --> 00:29:13.093
I don't mind covering
for ya'll's family but


643
00:29:13.093 --> 00:29:16.801
I'd rather not watch this
depravity.


644
00:29:16.801 --> 00:29:20.385
I don't give two shits on
a stick, what you want.


645
00:29:20.385 --> 00:29:23.885
About this fat guy?

646
00:29:23.885 --> 00:29:25.760
Of course.

647
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.593
Now, I didn't want to hurt
the boy


648
00:29:27.593 --> 00:29:30.301
I just needed to get his
dander up a little bit.


649
00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:33.343
You see... the fat guy

650
00:29:33.343 --> 00:29:35.676
He's my long lost brother.

651
00:29:35.676 --> 00:29:36.676
The baby?

652
00:29:36.676 --> 00:29:38.676
Baby boo....

653
00:29:40.218 --> 00:29:42.051
Is he horseman?

654
00:29:42.051 --> 00:29:43.510
Hell yeah!

655
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.010
Only the most glorious one
of us all.


656
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.260
It's gonna be bloody.

657
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.301
WELL....

658
00:29:50.301 --> 00:29:52.968
it IS the apocalypse.

659
00:29:52.968 --> 00:29:54.801
Now, you knew that

660
00:29:54.801 --> 00:29:57.885
when you signed over your soul
for your pound of flesh.


661
00:29:57.885 --> 00:30:00.885
Tell me sheriff...

662
00:30:00.885 --> 00:30:05.551
How is that sweet young thang

663
00:30:05.551 --> 00:30:07.718
I sent over to you?

664
00:30:07.718 --> 00:30:10.010
She's fine.

665
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.468
And, the sex?

666
00:30:12.468 --> 00:30:17.010
Is it everything you ever
dreamed about


667
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.551
in your entire life?

668
00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:22.593
Yeah.

669
00:30:22.593 --> 00:30:23.593
Well then

670
00:30:23.593 --> 00:30:26.760
the price has been bartered for

671
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.510
you are bought and sold.

672
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.926
And if I should tell you to

673
00:30:30.926 --> 00:30:33.551
lick the shit off
the bottom of my boot.

674
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:37.051
You are gonna hop to it...
post haste!


675
00:30:37.051 --> 00:30:39.551
What do you want me to do about
this fat guy?


676
00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:45.176
Tell you what

677
00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:47.593
you let him kill a bit more

678
00:30:47.593 --> 00:30:49.801
He needs to embrace his role
of death.


679
00:30:49.801 --> 00:30:51.426
Tomorrow night!

680
00:30:51.426 --> 00:30:53.301
Under the blood moon...

681
00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:55.301
we cut this tasty treat from her

682
00:30:55.301 --> 00:30:58.051
snatch all the way to her throat.

683
00:30:58.051 --> 00:31:01.051
We let her blood bring forth
our daddy.


684
00:31:01.051 --> 00:31:04.093
And then we rule the world
by his side.


685
00:31:04.093 --> 00:31:06.885
AMEN....brother.

686
00:31:09.093 --> 00:31:10.718
What about me?

687
00:31:10.718 --> 00:31:12.426
Don't worry sheriff.

688
00:31:12.426 --> 00:31:15.385
In a world ruled by the darkest
of souls


689
00:31:15.385 --> 00:31:18.510
there's always going to be a need
for a good


690
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.343
LOYAL

691
00:31:20.343 --> 00:31:21.926
Sheriff.

692
00:31:21.926 --> 00:31:22.926
Now,

693
00:31:22.926 --> 00:31:26.301
you get some of your boys
together here


694
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:27.301
and uh

695
00:31:27.301 --> 00:31:29.593
you pick a fight with my
little brother and


696
00:31:29.593 --> 00:31:32.343
you let the blood flow.

697
00:31:32.343 --> 00:31:34.760
Yes sir.

698
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.010
Shhhhhhhh

699
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:43.051
Oh, you can see yourself out,
you know where the door is.


700
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:46.676
My brother and I

701
00:31:46.676 --> 00:31:50.510
have a toy that needs our
undivided attention


702
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:52.510
Shhhh

703
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.885
Yeah...

704
00:31:54.885 --> 00:31:56.510
Oh this one is just too good

705
00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.135
We should have some fun first.

706
00:32:00.135 --> 00:32:03.135
No....no...

707
00:32:03.135 --> 00:32:04.801
You know the prophecy

708
00:32:04.801 --> 00:32:07.635
calls for a virgin sacrifice

709
00:32:07.635 --> 00:32:09.176
Now...

710
00:32:09.176 --> 00:32:12.426
we can play with the merchandise

711
00:32:12.426 --> 00:32:16.051
but we can't plaaaay with the
merchandise.


712
00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:17.801
Well shit Rayland.

713
00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:20.301
I's got to get my willie wet.

714
00:32:20.301 --> 00:32:23.760
What do you think my wife is for?

715
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.843
Awww... I'll take the back door.

716
00:32:29.593 --> 00:32:32.093
I guess I'll take the front door.

717
00:32:33.093 --> 00:32:34.926
Lead on brother.

718
00:32:34.926 --> 00:32:37.676
No, brother, after you.

719
00:32:37.676 --> 00:32:46.218
What a friend we have in Jesus

720
00:32:48.301 --> 00:32:52.260
So, what will you do if
you finally win?


721
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.260
WHEN.

722
00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.760
When I finally win.

723
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.218
Of course, of course....WHEN
you win.


724
00:32:58.218 --> 00:33:01.260
I'll give humans total freedom.

725
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.135
Freedom from morals.

726
00:33:03.135 --> 00:33:05.510
Freedom from empathy.

727
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:06.968
Freedom from God.

728
00:33:06.968 --> 00:33:07.968
God?

729
00:33:07.968 --> 00:33:12.051
You see Hell is...

730
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:14.051
The rape of the Congo.

731
00:33:14.051 --> 00:33:15.926
The Armenian genocide.

732
00:33:15.926 --> 00:33:17.635
Nanking.

733
00:33:17.635 --> 00:33:18.635
Wu han

734
00:33:18.635 --> 00:33:20.385
Jewish ghettos

735
00:33:20.385 --> 00:33:22.343
Cambodia.

736
00:33:22.343 --> 00:33:23.343
Gaza

737
00:33:23.343 --> 00:33:24.343
Sri Lanka

738
00:33:24.343 --> 00:33:25.343
Sierra

739
00:33:25.343 --> 00:33:26.343
Darfur, Croatia

740
00:33:26.343 --> 00:33:27.343
Bosnia

741
00:33:27.343 --> 00:33:29.218
It all happened on his watch

742
00:33:29.218 --> 00:33:30.218
He gave them free will.

743
00:33:30.218 --> 00:33:32.010
That was his first mistake.

744
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.968
So, you ask me what I'll
do when I win?


745
00:33:33.968 --> 00:33:36.676
The first thing I'll do is
eliminate adults from the equation.


746
00:33:36.676 --> 00:33:38.801
I'll raise children to bow
before me.


747
00:33:38.801 --> 00:33:41.468
I will provide order where he
provided chaos.


748
00:33:41.468 --> 00:33:46.343
I WILL BRING KNOWLEDGE.

749
00:33:46.343 --> 00:33:48.301
You won't let them discover it
on their own?


750
00:33:48.301 --> 00:33:49.385
OH PLEASE... he would let them
walk blindly


751
00:33:49.385 --> 00:33:50.510
through the wilderness

752
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.010
for all of eternity.

753
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.176
I'd give them direction.

754
00:33:53.968 --> 00:33:56.260
But, what will you do when
they question


755
00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.176
I'll give them answers.

756
00:33:59.176 --> 00:34:01.510
To everything or...

757
00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.468
just to the questions you like?

758
00:34:03.468 --> 00:34:04.468
See...

759
00:34:04.468 --> 00:34:08.843
humans grow and learn
they question.


760
00:34:08.843 --> 00:34:09.843
They try

761
00:34:09.843 --> 00:34:10.843
and they fail

762
00:34:10.843 --> 00:34:11.843
and they try again

763
00:34:11.843 --> 00:34:14.385
that's what makes them unique.

764
00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:16.843
Some try to follow God's instructions

765
00:34:16.843 --> 00:34:18.635
and some fail.

766
00:34:18.635 --> 00:34:21.176
Some will misuse his name or,

767
00:34:21.176 --> 00:34:23.010
misinterpret his intentions

768
00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.301
but, that's not really the point.

769
00:34:25.301 --> 00:34:27.635
So, what is the point?

770
00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:29.301
The point is that

771
00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:30.301
He was

772
00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:32.343
just the God of their creation.

773
00:34:32.343 --> 00:34:33.343
THEY

774
00:34:33.343 --> 00:34:34.593
are the Gods of their destiny

775
00:34:34.593 --> 00:34:36.593
and you want to rob them of that.

776
00:34:36.593 --> 00:34:38.635
NO... I want to harnass it.

777
00:34:40.635 --> 00:34:42.718
Some books say that God tried
to harness it once


778
00:34:42.718 --> 00:34:45.926
and you and I both know what came
out of that mistake.


779
00:34:45.926 --> 00:34:48.676
Then he should have ended
the experiment.


780
00:34:49.676 --> 00:34:52.676
Let's talk about your wife Lillith.

781
00:34:52.676 --> 00:34:54.635
HEY!

782
00:34:54.635 --> 00:34:56.676
We agreed you would not
bring her up.


783
00:34:56.676 --> 00:35:00.385
Lou, I am here to help you
work through all of your anger


784
00:35:00.385 --> 00:35:02.426
and that includes the anger
towards your wife.


785
00:35:02.426 --> 00:35:05.010
My EX... my ex-wife.

786
00:35:09.843 --> 00:35:10.843
You want to play?

787
00:35:10.843 --> 00:35:14.843
Okay, but what's the game?

788
00:35:14.843 --> 00:35:17.135
Go fish.

789
00:35:17.135 --> 00:35:22.010
Is your mouth ready to
receive a python?


790
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:26.718
I've seen your pecker Tenny.
Its a garter snake at best.


791
00:35:26.718 --> 00:35:30.926
Goddamn she
got you good.


792
00:35:30.926 --> 00:35:32.468
Well shit, Harlowe

793
00:35:32.468 --> 00:35:34.051
just cuz you got hit
with an ugly stick


794
00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:36.426
don't mean you get to laugh
at my pecker!


795
00:35:36.426 --> 00:35:39.051
DAMN Tenny, I was just
joshin' at ya.


796
00:35:39.051 --> 00:35:41.135
Bitch

797
00:35:41.135 --> 00:35:42.760
you told me

798
00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.260
that if I got you some weed
and a six pack


799
00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.051
you'd make my night.

800
00:35:47.051 --> 00:35:48.468
I'm here ain't I?

801
00:35:48.468 --> 00:35:49.968
You get to look at me.

802
00:35:49.968 --> 00:35:52.760
That's more than Harlowe
paid for.


803
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.926
Show me your tits.

804
00:35:54.926 --> 00:35:57.468
Yeah, lets see your tits.

805
00:35:57.468 --> 00:35:59.010
Uh-uh-uh.

806
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.010
FUCK THAT!

807
00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.301
No, I paid for tits

808
00:36:02.301 --> 00:36:03.301
You don't get shit.

809
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:05.426
You can turn your ass around.

810
00:36:05.426 --> 00:36:07.260
What the fuck you talking
about Tenny?


811
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.468
No, you didn't pay for shit.

812
00:36:09.468 --> 00:36:12.051
Fine, you can see my tits.

813
00:36:12.051 --> 00:36:13.426
Turn around.

814
00:36:13.426 --> 00:36:15.426
C'mon BRUH!
NO!


815
00:36:15.426 --> 00:36:20.801
I paid for this, you can
turn your ass around.


816
00:36:20.801 --> 00:36:22.301
Fuck you.

817
00:36:33.051 --> 00:36:34.426
Well shit.

818
00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:39.176
On a scale of one to Robocop,
I'd give that a Smokey and The Bandit.


819
00:36:39.176 --> 00:36:42.468
God Damn...

820
00:36:42.468 --> 00:36:43.135
(footsteps

821
00:36:43.135 --> 00:36:45.301
You know that's what I love about
Appalachia.


822
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:46.718
Man can't find him a woman

823
00:36:46.718 --> 00:36:49.176
But goddamn he can talk his
sister into a freebie.


824
00:36:49.176 --> 00:36:51.176
Fuck you, Sheriff.

825
00:36:51.176 --> 00:36:52.510
Fuck me, honey?

826
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.260
I ain't the one in the midst of
foreplay with her goddamn brothers.


827
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.843
Well shit, Sheriff.

828
00:36:57.843 --> 00:37:01.010
It ain't incest if you're paying
for it like everybody else.


829
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.676
Allright what the fuck you want here?

830
00:37:03.676 --> 00:37:06.343
Well, I ain't here on my own account
I can assure you that.


831
00:37:06.343 --> 00:37:09.010
Your cousin sent me to round up
a few expendables.


832
00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.176
Like the movie?

833
00:37:11.176 --> 00:37:14.926
Yeah Harlowe... just like the movie.

834
00:37:14.926 --> 00:37:18.218
Shit yeah.

835
00:37:18.218 --> 00:37:20.426
Rayland asked for us?

836
00:37:20.426 --> 00:37:23.051
Rayland asked for us.

837
00:37:23.051 --> 00:37:25.468
All three of ya, just by name.

838
00:37:25.468 --> 00:37:28.010
Well shit

839
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.635
He's starting to see our worth.

840
00:37:32.218 --> 00:37:33.218
Wait.

841
00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:35.010
What's he askin' us to do?

842
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.093
He ain't asking nothing you three
ain't capable of.


843
00:37:38.093 --> 00:37:42.260
Just pick up a little trash around
town and take it out.


844
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.301
Got an escaped convict.

845
00:37:44.301 --> 00:37:45.968
A dangerous convict?

846
00:37:45.968 --> 00:37:47.510
Nah....

847
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.635
just a fat guy with a shotgun.

848
00:37:49.635 --> 00:37:51.468
Like I said.

849
00:37:51.468 --> 00:37:53.468
It ain't nothin' you three can't handle.

850
00:37:55.676 --> 00:37:56.676
Fuckin' A.

851
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.510
We're steppin' up.

852
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.510
Fuck yeah.

853
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.718
It'll be a cake walk for you.

854
00:38:02.718 --> 00:38:04.885
Easy Breezy.

855
00:38:04.885 --> 00:38:06.801
Once we prove ourselves.

856
00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:08.218
I'm gonna get gussied up

857
00:38:08.218 --> 00:38:09.885
and work at the mayor's office.

858
00:38:09.885 --> 00:38:12.676
Don't that just beat all.

859
00:38:12.676 --> 00:38:13.676
Hell yeah.

860
00:38:16.968 --> 00:38:18.760
Fuckin' skedaddle shitheads.

861
00:38:30.343 --> 00:38:32.176
Fuckin' morons.

862
00:38:34.176 --> 00:38:36.135
We should get that in better sync.

863
00:38:36.135 --> 00:38:38.718
Yeah, that'd be nice.

864
00:38:38.718 --> 00:38:42.176
We should get food after this
keep your blood sugar regulated.


865
00:38:42.176 --> 00:38:44.801
I acquiesce to the urgency
of this material need.


866
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:47.426
This is the middle of nowhere.

867
00:38:47.426 --> 00:38:49.093
Ah... pardon us... Miss?

868
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.468
Well I do declare

869
00:38:52.468 --> 00:38:53.468
look at what has just shown

870
00:38:53.468 --> 00:38:55.176
up at my door.

871
00:38:55.176 --> 00:38:59.010
And what can I do to help you
handsome men?


872
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.968
Um, we're looking for your
Mother ma'am.


873
00:39:00.968 --> 00:39:02.926
My MAMA?

874
00:39:02.926 --> 00:39:05.551
Well, ain't you just the cutest thing.

875
00:39:05.551 --> 00:39:07.885
Oh my mama passed away years ago.

876
00:39:07.885 --> 00:39:09.176
Hellfire...

877
00:39:09.176 --> 00:39:11.676
She died before my boys were born.

878
00:39:11.676 --> 00:39:16.218
Oh but you are sweet
for saying so.


879
00:39:16.218 --> 00:39:18.260
Miss...

880
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.176
We're here to see Mrs. Ambrose
may we converse with her?


881
00:39:21.176 --> 00:39:23.301
Well... I'm Mrs. Ambrose.

882
00:39:23.301 --> 00:39:24.301
And

883
00:39:24.301 --> 00:39:25.885
If I may say

884
00:39:25.885 --> 00:39:26.885
YOU

885
00:39:26.885 --> 00:39:29.385
are a credit to your race
young man.


886
00:39:29.385 --> 00:39:34.135
A FIIIINNNNNE Specimen.

887
00:39:34.135 --> 00:39:36.510
Um, our apologies ma'am you-

888
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.176
just don't seem old enough.

889
00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:42.343
Aren't you just a silver tongued devil.

890
00:39:42.343 --> 00:39:44.843
Tell me...

891
00:39:44.843 --> 00:39:47.926
What else can you do with
that tongue?


892
00:39:47.926 --> 00:39:50.593
Ma'am if you are indeed
Mrs. Ambrose


893
00:39:50.593 --> 00:39:52.843
then we'd like to make a few
inquiries.


894
00:39:52.843 --> 00:39:56.468
I can assure you I AM the
mistress of this house.


895
00:39:57.468 --> 00:39:59.093
Now, I'm sure you

896
00:39:59.093 --> 00:40:00.343
city boys must think

897
00:40:00.343 --> 00:40:01.343
we mountainfolk have

898
00:40:01.343 --> 00:40:03.385
all manner of strange habits.

899
00:40:03.385 --> 00:40:05.260
Why, I bet you think

900
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.885
I stay young lookin' by

901
00:40:06.885 --> 00:40:10.093
bathing in the blood of virgins

902
00:40:10.093 --> 00:40:11.093
Excuse me?

903
00:40:12.093 --> 00:40:13.426
Don't worry sugar

904
00:40:13.426 --> 00:40:15.051
I do no such thing.

905
00:40:15.051 --> 00:40:16.968
I stay young lookin' by

906
00:40:17.968 --> 00:40:20.468
breathing this clean mountain air.

907
00:40:20.468 --> 00:40:23.510
And staying close to mother nature.

908
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.385
You know, there are times when I

909
00:40:25.385 --> 00:40:28.301
feel like I just
popped out of the ground.

910
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:29.301
I see.

911
00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:30.926
Now that we have established

912
00:40:30.926 --> 00:40:31.926
who I am

913
00:40:31.926 --> 00:40:33.301
May I ask

914
00:40:33.301 --> 00:40:34.301
who you two gentleman are

915
00:40:34.301 --> 00:40:36.010
and what questions you have?

916
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.010
Certainly.

917
00:40:38.926 --> 00:40:40.968
Special Agent Duane
Delmont FBI


918
00:40:40.968 --> 00:40:41.968
This is my partner.

919
00:40:41.968 --> 00:40:43.551
Special Agent Dwayne Dellmont

920
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:45.551
Well

921
00:40:45.551 --> 00:40:48.385
your mama and daddy didn't
have much of an imagination.


922
00:40:48.385 --> 00:40:49.385
No relation ma'am.

923
00:40:49.385 --> 00:40:50.676
We're here investigating the

924
00:40:50.676 --> 00:40:51.676
disappearance of this girl.

925
00:40:51.676 --> 00:40:54.260
Her name is Sophie Harlan.

926
00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.593
Well...

927
00:40:55.593 --> 00:40:57.676
she certainly looks delicious

928
00:40:57.676 --> 00:40:59.010
But...

929
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.551
I don't know what this
has to do with me.


930
00:41:01.551 --> 00:41:02.551
May we come in?

931
00:41:02.551 --> 00:41:03.551
Mercy me

932
00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:04.760
where are my manners

933
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.218
Of course you may.

934
00:41:06.218 --> 00:41:08.385
Usually I wouldn't even ask.

935
00:41:08.385 --> 00:41:11.676
I'd insist.

936
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.968
Now, I would love nothin better

937
00:41:16.968 --> 00:41:21.218
to help you boys achieve uh...

938
00:41:21.218 --> 00:41:22.801
Uh...

939
00:41:22.801 --> 00:41:23.801
to help you boys

940
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:25.635
achieve your

941
00:41:25.635 --> 00:41:26.635
uh

942
00:41:26.635 --> 00:41:27.635
Objective.

943
00:41:27.635 --> 00:41:28.635
Of finding this

944
00:41:28.635 --> 00:41:30.260
young girl, but

945
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.593
I just don't see how I can
help you.


946
00:41:33.593 --> 00:41:36.468
That smells really good.

947
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.510
Actually, Mrs. Ambrose

948
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.510
Oh please,

949
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.510
Call me Mama.

950
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.510
Everybody does

951
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.510
Uh..

952
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.510
Mrs. Ambrose,

953
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.051
Can you tell us the whereabouts
of your three sons?


954
00:41:47.051 --> 00:41:48.051
During the disappearance?

955
00:41:49.051 --> 00:41:51.218
There go my manners again!

956
00:41:51.218 --> 00:41:53.218
Would you two boys like
something to eat?


957
00:41:53.218 --> 00:41:54.218
No thank you ma'am.

958
00:41:54.218 --> 00:41:55.718
Uh, I would.

959
00:41:58.343 --> 00:41:59.760
When would that be?

960
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.051
49 hours and

961
00:42:02.051 --> 00:42:03.718
7 minutes.

962
00:42:03.718 --> 00:42:05.551
My...

963
00:42:05.551 --> 00:42:08.135
That does narrow it down a bit.

964
00:42:08.135 --> 00:42:11.301
You would have been good
working in a household.


965
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:16.051
Why, I can't rightly say where
my boys were but


966
00:42:16.051 --> 00:42:19.468
I'm sure they're not the ones
you're lookin' for.


967
00:42:19.468 --> 00:42:20.968
Why do you say that?

968
00:42:20.968 --> 00:42:23.426
Well my boys are blessed.

969
00:42:23.426 --> 00:42:25.551
And a blessing.

970
00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:27.926
Take those ribs and barbecue

971
00:42:27.926 --> 00:42:30.926
My boy Otis brought them by
for me.


972
00:42:30.926 --> 00:42:33.343
It's his secret recipe.

973
00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:34.968
He says

974
00:42:34.968 --> 00:42:36.635
it all starts with the

975
00:42:36.635 --> 00:42:38.176
right kind of meat.

976
00:42:38.176 --> 00:42:40.301
Gotta be fresh.

977
00:42:40.301 --> 00:42:42.635
That may well be, ma'am

978
00:42:42.635 --> 00:42:46.218
But we still need to speak with him.

979
00:42:46.218 --> 00:42:47.718
Can you tell us where they are now?

980
00:42:47.718 --> 00:42:48.718
Why...

981
00:42:48.718 --> 00:42:51.176
I

982
00:42:51.176 --> 00:42:52.551
I couldn't say.

983
00:42:52.551 --> 00:42:54.385
Well, what about Mister Ambrose?

984
00:42:54.385 --> 00:42:55.385
Oh

985
00:42:55.385 --> 00:42:56.385
The boy's daddy

986
00:42:56.385 --> 00:42:57.385
ain't been around

987
00:42:57.385 --> 00:42:59.176
for awhile....but

988
00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.176
I worship

989
00:43:00.176 --> 00:43:01.176
the ground he walks

990
00:43:01.176 --> 00:43:02.176
on

991
00:43:02.176 --> 00:43:03.426
We all do.

992
00:43:03.426 --> 00:43:04.926
In fact,

993
00:43:04.926 --> 00:43:07.135
We're preparing for his return

994
00:43:07.135 --> 00:43:08.135
OH...

995
00:43:08.135 --> 00:43:10.426
It's gonna be a hot time

996
00:43:10.426 --> 00:43:12.218
in this town when he does.

997
00:43:12.218 --> 00:43:13.218
Uh....

998
00:43:13.218 --> 00:43:14.218
that's...

999
00:43:14.218 --> 00:43:15.218
nice

1000
00:43:15.218 --> 00:43:16.218
um

1001
00:43:16.218 --> 00:43:17.218
Thank you

1002
00:43:17.218 --> 00:43:18.218
so much for your time

1003
00:43:18.218 --> 00:43:19.218
here's my

1004
00:43:19.218 --> 00:43:20.218
card

1005
00:43:21.218 --> 00:43:22.218
Tell your sons

1006
00:43:22.218 --> 00:43:24.093
that we'd like to spek with them.

1007
00:43:25.093 --> 00:43:26.426
We'll see ourselves out.

1008
00:43:27.426 --> 00:43:29.260
Oh don't mind none

1009
00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.676
Just as soon as I see

1010
00:43:30.676 --> 00:43:31.676
any of my boys

1011
00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:32.676
I'll send them right out

1012
00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:33.676
to find you.

1013
00:43:34.676 --> 00:43:36.718
Uh, thank you for the food.

1014
00:43:36.718 --> 00:43:38.676
Oh, and agents...

1015
00:43:38.676 --> 00:43:41.135
I've got four sons.

1016
00:43:41.135 --> 00:43:43.260
All right, we'll be in touch.

1017
00:43:47.635 --> 00:43:49.343
You wanna tell me what that
shit was about?


1018
00:43:50.343 --> 00:43:51.718
Why'd you keep me from eating man?

1019
00:43:51.718 --> 00:43:53.760
You know I'm a ribs and barbecue
man from way back right?


1020
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.843
Yeah, that's why I was so surprised
you didn't want any back there.


1021
00:43:55.843 --> 00:43:57.385
You know, with your blood sugar
and shit.


1022
00:43:57.385 --> 00:43:58.385
Duane...

1023
00:43:58.385 --> 00:43:59.385
You don't eat at

1024
00:43:59.385 --> 00:44:00.385
a suspects house... period.

1025
00:44:00.385 --> 00:44:01.385
What are you saying?

1026
00:44:01.385 --> 00:44:02.760
It's about the badge.

1027
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.593
We represent the badge Duane.

1028
00:44:04.593 --> 00:44:05.593
Fair.

1029
00:44:05.593 --> 00:44:06.593
And there is some

1030
00:44:06.593 --> 00:44:07.593
shit going on

1031
00:44:07.593 --> 00:44:09.218
in this county brother.

1032
00:44:09.218 --> 00:44:10.218
Beside,

1033
00:44:10.218 --> 00:44:11.218
Do you really want to eat

1034
00:44:11.218 --> 00:44:13.343
anything these hillbillies prepare?

1035
00:44:13.343 --> 00:44:15.676
NO.

1036
00:44:15.676 --> 00:44:16.676
Exactly.

1037
00:44:17.676 --> 00:44:18.676
So...

1038
00:44:18.676 --> 00:44:20.301
If they're guilty do we go ahead
and take her in?


1039
00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:21.676
No, no, no... let's...

1040
00:44:21.676 --> 00:44:24.010
find Catherine, there's some
weird shit going on down here.


1041
00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.010
Really weird shit.

1042
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.968
Yeah, weirder than that normal
WV weird shit.


1043
00:44:27.968 --> 00:44:29.510
Weird shit.

1044
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:32.926
If we kill anybody you're doing
the paperwork.


1045
00:44:33.926 --> 00:44:36.051
I want them dead.

1046
00:44:36.051 --> 00:44:37.051
Yes, Mama.

1047
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:39.218
And tell them, I want

1048
00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:42.135
their cocks and balls
for a nice stew


1049
00:44:42.135 --> 00:44:43.135
YES, MAMA!

1050
00:44:43.135 --> 00:44:45.593
Tell him, if he fails me

1051
00:44:45.593 --> 00:44:50.093
It will be his and his
deputies instead.


1052
00:44:50.093 --> 00:44:51.093
And

1053
00:44:51.093 --> 00:44:53.218
he'll serve them to me.

1054
00:44:53.218 --> 00:44:55.301
I'll deliver the message myself.

1055
00:44:55.301 --> 00:44:57.051
Ah...

1056
00:44:57.051 --> 00:44:59.635
Oh, all this stress

1057
00:44:59.635 --> 00:45:01.968
It is VERY hard on the skin.

1058
00:45:01.968 --> 00:45:02.968
Is that?

1059
00:45:02.968 --> 00:45:03.968
IS THAT A WRINKLE?!

1060
00:45:03.968 --> 00:45:04.968
No way Mama

1061
00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:05.968
No wrinkle would dare

1062
00:45:05.968 --> 00:45:06.968
touch your skin!

1063
00:45:06.968 --> 00:45:09.218
Aw... Buford darling

1064
00:45:09.218 --> 00:45:12.135
I need a bath.

1065
00:45:12.135 --> 00:45:13.135
I think.

1066
00:45:13.135 --> 00:45:15.551
I think three should do it.

1067
00:45:15.551 --> 00:45:16.551
Shall I kill them

1068
00:45:16.551 --> 00:45:17.551
or save that for you

1069
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:18.551
Mama?

1070
00:45:19.551 --> 00:45:20.551
No, I don't want

1071
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:21.551
you to cut their

1072
00:45:21.551 --> 00:45:22.551
throats..YOU KNOW

1073
00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:24.093
I LIKE A WARM BATH!

1074
00:45:24.093 --> 00:45:25.968
I'll do it myself.

1075
00:45:26.968 --> 00:45:27.968
Now, do you

1076
00:45:27.968 --> 00:45:28.968
require versions

1077
00:45:28.968 --> 00:45:29.968
for your

1078
00:45:29.968 --> 00:45:31.760
porcelain skin

1079
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.593
Or, will any blood do?

1080
00:45:33.593 --> 00:45:34.593
No need to be

1081
00:45:34.593 --> 00:45:35.593
virgins

1082
00:45:35.593 --> 00:45:36.593
Just innocent blood.

1083
00:45:36.593 --> 00:45:38.593
I NEVER lie to the law.

1084
00:45:38.593 --> 00:45:39.593
It's not my

1085
00:45:39.593 --> 00:45:40.593
problem its

1086
00:45:40.593 --> 00:45:41.593
so hard to come

1087
00:45:41.593 --> 00:45:42.593
by innocent blood.

1088
00:45:43.593 --> 00:45:44.593
Lordy.

1089
00:45:44.593 --> 00:45:45.968
I swear.

1090
00:45:45.968 --> 00:45:46.968
I am

1091
00:45:46.968 --> 00:45:47.968
SURROUNDED by idiots.

1092
00:45:48.968 --> 00:45:50.885
It's my cross to bear.

1093
00:45:50.885 --> 00:45:52.801
You are so right, Mama.

1094
00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:57.551
Idiots everywhere.

1095
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:22.593
Where the hell are you John?

1096
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:44.510
<i>Tell me</i>

1097
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.718
<i>about your tour.</i>

1098
00:46:52.426 --> 00:46:54.801
<i>I'd rather not.</i>

1099
00:46:54.801 --> 00:46:56.843
<i>All right, it was bad.</i>

1100
00:46:57.843 --> 00:46:59.801
<i>Isn't that enough?</i>

1101
00:46:59.801 --> 00:47:03.676
<i>Maybe for your buddies</i>

1102
00:47:03.676 --> 00:47:05.510
<i>But you and I are here</i>

1103
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:09.926
<i>to help you get past this
terrible ordeal.</i>


1104
00:47:09.926 --> 00:47:11.385
<i>You have it all in your records.</i>

1105
00:47:11.385 --> 00:47:12.385
<i>I know.</i>

1106
00:47:12.385 --> 00:47:15.718
<i>But uh... tell me in your own words.</i>

1107
00:47:17.718 --> 00:47:20.218
<i>In my words.</i>

1108
00:47:20.218 --> 00:47:23.260
<i>I was the only goddamn survivor.</i>

1109
00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:26.260
<i>What the fuck do you want me
to say about it?</i>


1110
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.301
<i>That is a....uh...</i>

1111
00:47:29.301 --> 00:47:33.260
<i>interesting choice of words
for the only survivor.</i>


1112
00:47:36.301 --> 00:47:39.218
<i>Sometimes life can also
be a death sentence, doc.</i>


1113
00:47:39.218 --> 00:47:41.093
<i>So, talk to me.</i>

1114
00:47:43.551 --> 00:47:47.468
<i>Okay, initially it wasn't
just me.</i>


1115
00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.926
<i>Initially there were three of us.</i>

1116
00:47:52.968 --> 00:47:55.718
<i>We made it the whole way
with very little food.</i>


1117
00:47:55.718 --> 00:47:58.135
<i>We were starving.</i>

1118
00:47:59.135 --> 00:48:00.135
<i>We were gettin' real thin</i>

1119
00:48:00.135 --> 00:48:01.843
<i>but, not just...</i>

1120
00:48:01.843 --> 00:48:02.843
<i>thin</i>

1121
00:48:02.843 --> 00:48:03.843
<i>yeah...</i>

1122
00:48:03.843 --> 00:48:05.593
<i>We were holocaust skinny.</i>

1123
00:48:05.593 --> 00:48:07.343
<i>The three of us</i>

1124
00:48:07.343 --> 00:48:09.885
<i>Mikey had it the worst.
Mikey was dyin'.</i>


1125
00:48:09.885 --> 00:48:12.176
<i>In front of our eyes.</i>

1126
00:48:12.176 --> 00:48:13.801
<i>And for some reason</i>

1127
00:48:13.801 --> 00:48:15.593
<i>I wasn't losing the weight</i>

1128
00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:16.593
<i>like everyone else was</i>

1129
00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:17.593
<i>I still had my strength</i>

1130
00:48:17.593 --> 00:48:19.218
<i>I could hack the pain.</i>

1131
00:48:20.218 --> 00:48:21.218
<i>So...</i>

1132
00:48:21.218 --> 00:48:22.218
<i>We were gettin'</i>

1133
00:48:22.218 --> 00:48:23.760
<i>whatever little rations we had</i>

1134
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.926
<i>I was givin'a lot of em out.</i>

1135
00:48:25.926 --> 00:48:28.676
<i>Mikey mostly.</i>

1136
00:48:31.051 --> 00:48:32.051
<i>The amount of food I was</i>

1137
00:48:32.051 --> 00:48:33.051
<i>givin' I guess his</i>

1138
00:48:33.051 --> 00:48:34.051
<i>stomach burst.</i>

1139
00:48:36.593 --> 00:48:38.968
<i>You know, you hack it
through the march.</i>


1140
00:48:38.968 --> 00:48:43.260
<i>Survive those fuckin'
hellships.</i>


1141
00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.760
<i>You get all the way to the camp.</i>

1142
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.385
<i>And just because</i>

1143
00:48:47.385 --> 00:48:50.093
<i>some buddy gives you
some extra bread.</i>


1144
00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:53.051
<i>That's how you go?</i>

1145
00:48:55.968 --> 00:48:56.968
<i>So, you're blaming</i>

1146
00:48:56.968 --> 00:48:57.968
<i>yourself for</i>

1147
00:48:57.968 --> 00:49:00.218
<i>an act of kindness?</i>

1148
00:49:03.676 --> 00:49:04.676
<i>Wouldn't you?</i>

1149
00:49:09.218 --> 00:49:11.385
<i>World War Two?</i>

1150
00:49:11.385 --> 00:49:12.385
<i>What?</i>

1151
00:49:16.343 --> 00:49:18.885
<i>Tell me about your childhood.</i>

1152
00:49:20.385 --> 00:49:22.426
<i>Gettin' really tired of talkin, Doc.</i>

1153
00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:24.176
<i>All right... its all in the file.</i>

1154
00:49:24.176 --> 00:49:26.301
<i>No, its not John.</i>

1155
00:49:26.301 --> 00:49:27.718
<i>All it tells me is you</i>

1156
00:49:27.718 --> 00:49:30.301
<i>grew up in a group home
and the work houses.</i>


1157
00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:32.468
<i>Doesn't tell me anything else.</i>

1158
00:49:34.635 --> 00:49:37.051
<i>All right, I really don't remember much.</i>

1159
00:49:37.051 --> 00:49:39.468
<i>I know I was born in West Virginia.</i>

1160
00:49:39.468 --> 00:49:42.093
<i>I know my Mother gave me
up for adoption</i>


1161
00:49:42.093 --> 00:49:44.301
<i>I worked in some shoe factory</i>

1162
00:49:44.301 --> 00:49:45.760
<i>shortly after I turned six</i>

1163
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.760
<i>and I stayed there</i>

1164
00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.176
<i>really, until I was old enough
to enlist.</i>


1165
00:49:49.176 --> 00:49:50.593
<i>And shortly after that</i>

1166
00:49:50.593 --> 00:49:52.801
<i>I was in 4th Marines
headed to the Pacific.</i>


1167
00:49:52.801 --> 00:49:56.343
Workhouses?

1168
00:49:56.343 --> 00:50:00.176
How the fuck old is this guy?

1169
00:50:01.801 --> 00:50:03.843
<i>Pretty sure I have some
siblings somewhere.</i>


1170
00:50:03.843 --> 00:50:05.760
<i>Well, have you ever tried
to find them?</i>


1171
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.676
<i>Nah... not really.</i>

1172
00:50:07.676 --> 00:50:09.760
<i>Well, I've always believed um...</i>

1173
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.218
<i>the family that you choose</i>

1174
00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:15.718
<i>is far more important than
the family that you are given.</i>


1175
00:50:15.718 --> 00:50:18.926
<i>I agree with that.</i>

1176
00:50:18.926 --> 00:50:22.135
<i>You are a good man, John.</i>

1177
00:50:22.135 --> 00:50:24.385
<i>So?</i>

1178
00:50:24.385 --> 00:50:27.051
<i>We all done then?</i>

1179
00:50:27.051 --> 00:50:29.343
<i>Almost John, almost.</i>

1180
00:50:29.343 --> 00:50:31.801
<i>Have you ever...</i>

1181
00:50:31.801 --> 00:50:33.801
<i>looked into your past?</i>

1182
00:50:33.801 --> 00:50:36.051
<i>Not really.</i>

1183
00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:37.926
<i>A little bit.</i>

1184
00:50:37.926 --> 00:50:39.551
<i>I know the family name</i>

1185
00:50:39.551 --> 00:50:42.593
<i>on my birth certificate
says Ambrose.</i>


1186
00:50:42.593 --> 00:50:44.426
<i>I met a woman.</i>

1187
00:50:44.426 --> 00:50:47.218
<i>And uh...</i>

1188
00:50:47.218 --> 00:50:49.426
<i>I'm going to ask her to marry me.</i>

1189
00:50:49.426 --> 00:50:52.426
<i>But uh, I want
to make sure the uh</i>

1190
00:50:52.426 --> 00:50:55.051
<i>the nightmares stop first.</i>

1191
00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:57.801
<i>Well</i>

1192
00:50:57.801 --> 00:51:02.593
<i>I can't guarantee the nightmares
will be gone forever, John.</i>


1193
00:51:02.593 --> 00:51:06.468
<i>But, I do know
you are a good man.</i>

1194
00:51:08.051 --> 00:51:09.051
That's it?

1195
00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:11.718
No investigation?

1196
00:51:22.176 --> 00:51:23.176
Who is it?

1197
00:51:23.176 --> 00:51:24.176
Duane

1198
00:51:24.176 --> 00:51:25.176
and Dwayne.

1199
00:51:29.218 --> 00:51:31.301
Come on in.

1200
00:51:34.801 --> 00:51:35.801
Uh...

1201
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:37.968
US Marshalls don't offer
a per diem?


1202
00:51:38.968 --> 00:51:39.968
We're here to give you your award

1203
00:51:39.968 --> 00:51:41.635
for WV's shittiest hotel room?

1204
00:51:41.635 --> 00:51:44.676
Competition was stiff this year
so....congratulations.


1205
00:51:44.676 --> 00:51:45.676
ha-ha.

1206
00:51:45.676 --> 00:51:48.593
We just had the strangest....uh

1207
00:51:48.593 --> 00:51:50.635
You might wanna...

1208
00:51:50.635 --> 00:51:51.635
What?

1209
00:51:51.635 --> 00:51:52.635
Clothes.

1210
00:51:52.635 --> 00:51:55.468
Oh right...

1211
00:51:55.468 --> 00:51:56.468
Sorry kids.

1212
00:51:56.468 --> 00:51:59.635
Guess you haven't seen
these before.


1213
00:52:04.093 --> 00:52:07.218
I have a problem.

1214
00:52:08.218 --> 00:52:09.926
I think my guy is....

1215
00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:14.718
Um...

1216
00:52:16.593 --> 00:52:18.635
I think my guy is innocent.

1217
00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.135
You sure?

1218
00:52:20.135 --> 00:52:22.510
NO! I'm not sure.

1219
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.260
But my gut is telling me

1220
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.260
<i>Is it done?</i>

1221
00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.260
What the fuck is that?

1222
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.260
He hasn't spoken a word.

1223
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.135
He was covered in
his wife's blood.


1224
00:52:31.135 --> 00:52:33.426
But his wife was
killed with a revolver.


1225
00:52:33.426 --> 00:52:35.885
All we recovered
was a shotgun.


1226
00:52:35.885 --> 00:52:39.010
So, the official story is

1227
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:42.593
he threw the murder weapon
away, officer.


1228
00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:45.135
Damn son, do I have to do
everything?


1229
00:52:45.135 --> 00:52:46.760
No, ma'am.

1230
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.968
So, ummmmm

1231
00:52:48.968 --> 00:52:50.468
Who the fuck is that?

1232
00:52:50.468 --> 00:52:51.468
Uh...

1233
00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:52.468
Yeah?

1234
00:52:52.468 --> 00:52:53.468
Shhhh

1235
00:52:53.468 --> 00:52:55.218
You tryin' to ask me
something, son?


1236
00:52:55.218 --> 00:52:57.926
You promised me
a reward.


1237
00:52:57.926 --> 00:53:00.176
Oh... right.

1238
00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:03.051
You wanted to live forever

1239
00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:04.051
is that right?

1240
00:53:04.051 --> 00:53:05.051
Yes, Mama!

1241
00:53:05.051 --> 00:53:07.593
And what was your
name again?


1242
00:53:07.593 --> 00:53:09.260
Buford.

1243
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.010
We're going to get along
just fine Buford darlin.


1244
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:13.010
I know that voice.

1245
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:14.010
Yeah?

1246
00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:16.468
Yeah. That's Mrs. Ambrose.

1247
00:53:16.468 --> 00:53:18.426
Wait, Rayland's mother?

1248
00:53:18.426 --> 00:53:21.218
How fucking old is she?

1249
00:53:22.218 --> 00:53:23.760
The thing is, she looks younger
than you.


1250
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.676
Oh, SHUT THE FUCK UP!

1251
00:53:25.676 --> 00:53:27.510
I've been working all day.

1252
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:29.801
It's not as though I look
like I'm in my 70's


1253
00:53:29.801 --> 00:53:31.218
Yeah, that's the thing.

1254
00:53:31.218 --> 00:53:32.218
Neither did she.

1255
00:53:34.926 --> 00:53:36.426
What's going on in this county?

1256
00:53:36.426 --> 00:53:39.926
Whatever it is... it is not normal.

1257
00:55:17.301 --> 00:55:20.760
Where in the hell do you
think he's at?


1258
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.760
I don't know.

1259
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.760
Here comes somebody.

1260
00:55:35.843 --> 00:55:37.718
You're going to want to
get out of my way.


1261
00:55:39.385 --> 00:55:41.885
If you're not an Ambrose
we got no beef.


1262
00:55:41.885 --> 00:55:45.551
We're the new generation
of Ambrose.


1263
00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:47.718
Is that so?

1264
00:55:47.718 --> 00:55:49.385
Yeah.

1265
00:55:49.385 --> 00:55:50.926
You heard what she said.

1266
00:55:50.926 --> 00:55:53.176
Shut up, can't you see I'm talking?

1267
00:55:53.176 --> 00:55:57.176
We're the new motherfuckers
in town.


1268
00:55:59.301 --> 00:56:01.510
The new motherfuckers?

1269
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:02.510
YEAH!

1270
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.801
So, that means....

1271
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:07.926
that this is your unlucky day
FAT MAN.


1272
00:56:11.385 --> 00:56:12.385
I guess so.

1273
00:56:30.468 --> 00:56:32.301
What the fuck?

1274
00:56:55.926 --> 00:57:00.968
Do you have any queens?

1275
00:57:00.968 --> 00:57:03.635
Hmmm, Go fish.

1276
00:57:11.343 --> 00:57:14.593
Uh, about your dream.

1277
00:57:14.593 --> 00:57:21.343
Tell me, why would you have
your youngest go live in foster care?


1278
00:57:21.343 --> 00:57:22.551
Are you kidding me?

1279
00:57:22.551 --> 00:57:23.551
He's DEATH.

1280
00:57:23.551 --> 00:57:26.426
I needed him to have a healthy
disdain for humanity.


1281
00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:28.301
What better way to do that than

1282
00:57:28.301 --> 00:57:29.301
to send him out into the world

1283
00:57:29.301 --> 00:57:30.301
surrounded bythe meat

1284
00:57:30.301 --> 00:57:31.301
puppets he plans to harvest?

1285
00:57:31.301 --> 00:57:32.885
Have you met people?

1286
00:57:32.885 --> 00:57:33.885
I have.

1287
00:57:33.885 --> 00:57:35.301
And I find

1288
00:57:35.301 --> 00:57:36.301
that most of them are

1289
00:57:36.301 --> 00:57:37.926
hard working and decent.

1290
00:57:37.926 --> 00:57:38.926
And working together

1291
00:57:38.926 --> 00:57:40.468
for a common goal to

1292
00:57:40.468 --> 00:57:41.468
make the world a better

1293
00:57:41.468 --> 00:57:43.885
place for the coming generation.

1294
00:57:43.885 --> 00:57:44.885
All right Goddamnit

1295
00:57:44.885 --> 00:57:47.218
Ya'll follow my lead.

1296
00:57:47.218 --> 00:57:49.218
We'll get the jump on these
sons of bitches.


1297
00:57:51.218 --> 00:57:55.843
So, what did the judge say?

1298
00:57:56.843 --> 00:57:58.843
He's playing golf

1299
00:57:58.843 --> 00:58:00.843
Oh.

1300
00:58:01.843 --> 00:58:02.843
Looks like we're going

1301
00:58:02.843 --> 00:58:04.385
with my plan, aren't we?

1302
00:58:04.385 --> 00:58:05.885
We still need a warrant Duane.

1303
00:58:05.885 --> 00:58:09.385
You know, I always wanted to be
the Mexicans in Butch and Sundance.


1304
00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:10.385
Well...

1305
00:58:10.385 --> 00:58:11.385
you know boss if

1306
00:58:11.385 --> 00:58:12.926
we're going to be technical

1307
00:58:12.926 --> 00:58:13.635
Um

1308
00:58:13.635 --> 00:58:15.218
Really its Butch

1309
00:58:15.218 --> 00:58:16.635
and Sundance

1310
00:58:16.635 --> 00:58:18.468
AND Sundance.

1311
00:58:18.468 --> 00:58:19.218
Right?

1312
00:58:19.218 --> 00:58:20.801
You know?

1313
00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:21.926
I reckon you got a point.

1314
00:58:21.926 --> 00:58:22.926
Thank you.

1315
00:58:22.926 --> 00:58:24.468
Huckleberry

1316
00:58:24.468 --> 00:58:25.843
Bring over Wyatt.

1317
00:58:25.843 --> 00:58:27.676
Well, I'm your Huckleberry.

1318
00:58:27.676 --> 00:58:29.635
You gotta stop saying that shit.

1319
00:58:29.635 --> 00:58:31.593
All right.

1320
00:58:31.593 --> 00:58:34.593
On my sign.

1321
00:58:36.093 --> 00:58:36.635
Shit.

1322
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:40.093
Looks like a damn Klan rally out there.

1323
00:58:40.093 --> 00:58:42.676
They have a machine gun.

1324
00:58:42.676 --> 00:58:43.926
SHIT!

1325
00:58:47.176 --> 00:58:48.176
Goddamnit...
I'm sorry Boss.


1326
00:58:48.176 --> 00:58:49.176
I'm so sorry.

1327
00:58:49.176 --> 00:58:49.676
I'm so sorry.

1328
00:58:49.676 --> 00:58:50.676
Fuck it... SHOOT!

1329
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:07.551
Fuck.

1330
00:59:09.426 --> 00:59:11.385
I want a machine gun.

1331
00:59:11.385 --> 00:59:12.385
Okay.

1332
00:59:12.385 --> 00:59:13.885
We're going to get them while
they are still reloading.


1333
00:59:13.885 --> 00:59:14.885
Um, short Duane

1334
00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:15.885
I need you to go get the car.

1335
00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:17.176
Tall Dwayne go to the right.

1336
00:59:17.176 --> 00:59:18.176
And I'm going to go down the center.

1337
00:59:18.176 --> 00:59:19.176
Okay?

1338
00:59:19.176 --> 00:59:20.176
So. I'm going for the right?

1339
00:59:20.176 --> 00:59:22.093
OH. MY. GOD.

1340
00:59:22.093 --> 00:59:23.468
YOU, DUANE

1341
00:59:23.468 --> 00:59:24.801
You go get the car!

1342
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:26.093
You DWAYNE

1343
00:59:26.093 --> 00:59:27.093
You go to the right.

1344
00:59:27.093 --> 00:59:28.635
I'm going to go down the center.

1345
00:59:28.635 --> 00:59:29.635
Are we good?

1346
00:59:29.635 --> 00:59:30.343
OKAY

1347
00:59:31.343 --> 00:59:34.843
Shit...

1348
00:59:34.843 --> 00:59:36.718
So, what happened next?

1349
00:59:36.718 --> 00:59:38.843
Huh?

1350
00:59:38.843 --> 00:59:40.468
The motel shootout.

1351
00:59:40.468 --> 00:59:41.468
Oh.

1352
00:59:41.468 --> 00:59:42.468
Uh.

1353
00:59:42.468 --> 00:59:45.510
So, the fat fuck rode in on his
fat pale horse


1354
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:48.051
came to save the day.
Do you have any threes?


1355
00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.718
Go fish.

1356
01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.260
Fuck, its my tree.

1357
01:00:19.093 --> 01:00:20.093
I'm going right, cover me.

1358
01:00:20.093 --> 01:00:21.093
Okay!

1359
01:00:21.093 --> 01:00:21.843
Okay, GO!

1360
01:00:37.385 --> 01:00:38.385
Fuckin' A!

1361
01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:55.635
I have him.

1362
01:00:55.635 --> 01:00:57.010
Great, get the kid to safety.

1363
01:01:09.176 --> 01:01:10.010
DUANE!

1364
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.010
What?

1365
01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:13.135
No, short Duane!

1366
01:01:13.135 --> 01:01:14.135
Nyuh-uh...

1367
01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:15.135
WHITE DWAYNE!

1368
01:01:15.135 --> 01:01:17.551
JESUS CHRIST DWAYNE

1369
01:01:17.551 --> 01:01:19.801
What the fuck are we gonna do
now, Boss?


1370
01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.676
You hold down this spot now
Tennessee.


1371
01:01:21.676 --> 01:01:23.510
And, I'm gonna go and get
us some help.


1372
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:24.510
I... I... I...

1373
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:25.510
I can't

1374
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:26.510
Now listen,

1375
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:29.426
Goddamnit, you've been saying
you want more responsibility.


1376
01:01:29.426 --> 01:01:31.301
Now, this is more responsibilty.

1377
01:01:31.301 --> 01:01:33.051
No, boss, I kinda like doin' nothin'.

1378
01:01:33.051 --> 01:01:35.260
I wish I was doin' nothin
right now.


1379
01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.843
You got this.

1380
01:01:36.843 --> 01:01:38.218
I got... uh...

1381
01:01:38.218 --> 01:01:39.218
Dammit Boss

1382
01:01:39.218 --> 01:01:41.051
We can't do this.

1383
01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:43.676
Goddamnit Boys, there ain't no
way that fat son of a bitch


1384
01:01:43.676 --> 01:01:45.301
can hit us from there.

1385
01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:54.676
Fuck this.

1386
01:01:54.676 --> 01:01:55.676
Fuck this.

1387
01:01:55.676 --> 01:01:56.968
I'm out! I'M OUT!

1388
01:02:06.176 --> 01:02:07.885
FREEZE JOHN!

1389
01:02:07.885 --> 01:02:09.593
I SAID FREEZE!

1390
01:02:11.468 --> 01:02:13.593
Look, I know you didn't kill
your wife and child.


1391
01:02:14.593 --> 01:02:15.593
Okay?

1392
01:02:15.593 --> 01:02:18.593
I know the Ambrose Family had
something to do with it.


1393
01:02:20.926 --> 01:02:22.426
You're going to kill all of them
aren't you?


1394
01:02:23.426 --> 01:02:24.760
Look, I have a job to do.

1395
01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.510
And that means bringing you in
no matter what.


1396
01:02:30.551 --> 01:02:32.260
Which is why its going
to be so hard


1397
01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.301
to tell them how you got away.

1398
01:02:37.051 --> 01:02:39.135
Look, I'm going to the Ambrose house
now and I'm going to help


1399
01:02:39.135 --> 01:02:40.801
these agents find that missing girl.

1400
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:41.801
This may be our one chance

1401
01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:42.801
to make sure that bastard

1402
01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:43.801
doesn't hurt anyone else.

1403
01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:44.801
I'll be there.

1404
01:02:44.801 --> 01:02:45.801
I was hoping you would say that.

1405
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:49.676
Look, I gotta help them, okay.

1406
01:02:56.968 --> 01:02:57.968
We good?

1407
01:02:58.968 --> 01:03:00.176
Yeah. We're good.

1408
01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:02.801
All right, lets go get that
missing girl of yours.


1409
01:03:02.801 --> 01:03:03.968
What about your fugitive?

1410
01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:06.093
What fugitive?

1411
01:03:06.093 --> 01:03:08.551
Who were these assholes?

1412
01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:09.968
I don't know.

1413
01:03:09.968 --> 01:03:13.010
But, I'm guessing they all share
the same family shrubbery.


1414
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:14.843
And also judging by the fact

1415
01:03:14.843 --> 01:03:15.843
that we have a local deputy

1416
01:03:15.843 --> 01:03:16.843
lying over there

1417
01:03:16.843 --> 01:03:17.843
with a tomahawk

1418
01:03:17.843 --> 01:03:18.843
in his head

1419
01:03:18.843 --> 01:03:21.385
I'm guessing that we'redealing
with local law enforcement.


1420
01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:23.801
You know, I wanted to go to Seattle.

1421
01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:26.968
But, my partner here insisted on
the National Capitol.


1422
01:03:26.968 --> 01:03:30.760
Which covers this lovely bit of
West Virginia.


1423
01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.385
Too much rain.

1424
01:03:33.385 --> 01:03:36.510
I'm not writing up tomahawk guy.

1425
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:37.510
Not me...

1426
01:03:40.551 --> 01:03:41.551
Okay.

1427
01:03:43.551 --> 01:03:44.551
Please...

1428
01:03:45.551 --> 01:03:46.551
God

1429
01:03:47.551 --> 01:03:48.551
Get me outta here.

1430
01:03:49.968 --> 01:03:52.093
Please send somebody to save me.

1431
01:03:53.093 --> 01:03:55.510
I swear I will never doubt you again.

1432
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.468
And I will never take my
grandparents forgranted.


1433
01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:01.260
I've made so many mistakes.

1434
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:04.426
Surprise Girl.

1435
01:04:07.426 --> 01:04:08.968
You pray to a God who

1436
01:04:08.968 --> 01:04:11.301
doesn't like to meddle.

1437
01:04:11.301 --> 01:04:13.801
Do you know what

1438
01:04:13.801 --> 01:04:16.885
inaction gets you?

1439
01:04:20.426 --> 01:04:21.426
Do you?

1440
01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:23.426
No.

1441
01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:26.551
Awww

1442
01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.926
ME.

1443
01:04:29.926 --> 01:04:33.843
Awww

1444
01:04:46.176 --> 01:04:48.176
You wanna know a secret?

1445
01:04:49.843 --> 01:04:52.426
My brother Rayland likes you.

1446
01:04:52.426 --> 01:04:55.926
He wanted you all for his own.

1447
01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:57.510
But I told him that

1448
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:59.468
just wouldn't do.

1449
01:05:00.468 --> 01:05:01.468
Your blood

1450
01:05:01.468 --> 01:05:03.968
will usher in a new era.

1451
01:05:03.968 --> 01:05:06.301
And bring our Daddy back.

1452
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:13.176
Oh... the tears of a virgin

1453
01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:16.135
Mama sure does want those.

1454
01:05:16.135 --> 01:05:21.301
Wasted opportunity in every drop.

1455
01:05:23.926 --> 01:05:25.426
Why are you doing this?

1456
01:05:25.426 --> 01:05:26.926
Because...

1457
01:05:26.926 --> 01:05:29.760
there are two sides to every war

1458
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.885
You're lyin' here

1459
01:05:31.885 --> 01:05:33.635
vulnerable

1460
01:05:33.635 --> 01:05:35.260
praying to a God

1461
01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.218
who just won't answer, and

1462
01:05:37.218 --> 01:05:40.301
I spent my entire childhood

1463
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:42.551
waitin' for a Daddy who couldn't

1464
01:05:42.551 --> 01:05:43.551
You see

1465
01:05:43.551 --> 01:05:45.801
a very long time ago

1466
01:05:45.801 --> 01:05:47.510
my Daddy

1467
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.301
was banished

1468
01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:50.760
by your Daddy.

1469
01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.385
And I want my Daddy back.

1470
01:05:53.385 --> 01:05:56.218
My Daddy died in the Gulf War
He didn't banish anybody!


1471
01:05:56.218 --> 01:06:00.260
I don't give a damn about
your mortal father!


1472
01:06:01.635 --> 01:06:06.010
Shhhh

1473
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.510
I'm talking bigger than that
sweetheart


1474
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:11.843
Satan is your Father?

1475
01:06:13.343 --> 01:06:15.760
Lucifer

1476
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.176
Augustine

1477
01:06:17.176 --> 01:06:18.385
Ambrose

1478
01:06:18.385 --> 01:06:21.218
It's an older name than most realize.

1479
01:06:21.218 --> 01:06:22.218
You're insane!

1480
01:06:22.218 --> 01:06:23.218
You see

1481
01:06:23.218 --> 01:06:25.135
My Daddy

1482
01:06:25.135 --> 01:06:26.135
had four sons

1483
01:06:26.135 --> 01:06:27.135
and he gave each

1484
01:06:27.135 --> 01:06:28.135
of us a horse

1485
01:06:28.135 --> 01:06:30.135
My Horse

1486
01:06:30.135 --> 01:06:31.135
was black

1487
01:06:31.135 --> 01:06:33.426
Four horsemen?

1488
01:06:33.426 --> 01:06:34.843
FAMINE!

1489
01:06:34.843 --> 01:06:36.260
At your service

1490
01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.260
and you

1491
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.260
are the blood

1492
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.260
of innocence

1493
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.676
Your blood

1494
01:06:40.676 --> 01:06:43.385
will create a blight

1495
01:06:43.385 --> 01:06:44.968
that will

1496
01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:45.968
KILL

1497
01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:46.968
the very

1498
01:06:46.968 --> 01:06:47.968
ground the humans

1499
01:06:47.968 --> 01:06:49.926
souls walk it will

1500
01:06:49.926 --> 01:06:51.926
DEFILE IT.

1501
01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.968
Or at least it would have

1502
01:06:57.968 --> 01:07:00.343
W-w-what do you mean would have?

1503
01:07:00.343 --> 01:07:02.885

01:12:59.468 --> 01:13:01.343
Well...

1677
01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.343
uh, please...

1678
01:13:02.343 --> 01:13:03.968
Feel free

1679
01:13:03.968 --> 01:13:05.801
to search the premises

1680
01:13:05.801 --> 01:13:08.010
Uh, my wife will be happy to show

1681
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:09.010
you around.

1682
01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.010
While I finish

1683
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:11.760
my breakfast.

1684
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.176
Uh, I would do so myself

1685
01:13:14.176 --> 01:13:15.676
But

1686
01:13:15.676 --> 01:13:16.676
I have a very

1687
01:13:16.676 --> 01:13:18.135
busy day ahead

1688
01:13:18.135 --> 01:13:19.385
and its just been

1689
01:13:19.385 --> 01:13:20.385
complicated

1690
01:13:20.385 --> 01:13:21.385
by having to call

1691
01:13:21.385 --> 01:13:23.926
a bunch of supervisors

1692
01:13:23.926 --> 01:13:25.301
Which is

1693
01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:26.593
my favorite hobby

1694
01:13:26.593 --> 01:13:28.051
Calling supervisors and

1695
01:13:28.051 --> 01:13:30.468
having officers fired.

1696
01:13:30.468 --> 01:13:32.676
You are going to shoot

1697
01:13:32.676 --> 01:13:33.676
a mayor

1698
01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:35.635
for eating his breakfast?

1699
01:13:37.093 --> 01:13:38.718
All lives matter

1700
01:13:38.718 --> 01:13:39.801
You good?

1701
01:13:39.801 --> 01:13:41.843
Yeah, I'm fine.

1702
01:13:41.843 --> 01:13:43.260
Ma'am

1703
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.260
I need you to take these

1704
01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.260
agents around the house.

1705
01:13:59.676 --> 01:14:01.676
Now tell me...

1706
01:14:01.676 --> 01:14:03.676
Why

1707
01:14:03.676 --> 01:14:05.718

1708
01:14:05.718 --> 01:14:09.093

1716
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:24.218
pleasure and earthly delight

1717
01:14:24.218 --> 01:14:27.176

1849
01:21:58.551 --> 01:22:00.426
♪ To the sound of calamity

1850
01:22:00.426 --> 01:22:02.468
I didn't do this.

1851
01:22:02.468 --> 01:22:05.051
But, I know who did.

1852
01:22:05.051 --> 01:22:08.218
I followed him to your house.

1853
01:22:08.218 --> 01:22:11.260
I think he was waiting for you.

1854
01:22:13.801 --> 01:22:16.343
I'm sorry I couldn't save her.

1855
01:22:16.343 --> 01:22:19.676
(walking

1856
01:22:19.676 --> 01:22:22.885
Jesus, that is one tough Oma.

1857
01:22:25.135 --> 01:22:26.135
BABY!

1858
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:31.885
Oh Baby, I shouldn't have
left you!


1859
01:22:31.885 --> 01:22:34.510
I thought I was leadin'
em away from you.


1860
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:37.301
I shoulda never left
my Boston Belle.


1861
01:22:37.301 --> 01:22:40.051
Then, you'd be dead too.

1862
01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:41.510
Who the fuck are you?

1863
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:42.510
GRANDPA!

1864
01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.510
Who the hell are you?

1865
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:48.676
And what are you doin'
in my house?


1866
01:22:48.676 --> 01:22:49.968
He saved me Grandpa.

1867
01:22:49.968 --> 01:22:50.968
They all did.

1868
01:22:51.968 --> 01:22:54.301
What the fuck do we
do with you?


1869
01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:55.301
Nothing.

1870
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.885
I just want to live in peace.

1871
01:22:58.885 --> 01:23:01.343
You're not finished yet.

1872
01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:07.385
We stopped the apocalypse

1873
01:23:07.385 --> 01:23:09.510
The rest is up to you.

1874
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:13.218
We should be more
concerned about her.


1875
01:23:15.301 --> 01:23:16.301
She's been shoving her face

1876
01:23:16.301 --> 01:23:17.676
with bloodsoaked cookies

1877
01:23:17.676 --> 01:23:19.760
or, has nobody noticed.

1878
01:23:25.343 --> 01:23:26.343
Ugh...

1879
01:23:26.343 --> 01:23:27.343
Holy shit.

1880
01:23:27.343 --> 01:23:30.260
I'm hungry.

1881
01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.635
ALL THE TIME.

1882
01:23:36.218 --> 01:23:37.885
It can be reversed.

1883
01:23:37.885 --> 01:23:41.051
But, she's gonna have
to come with me


1884
01:23:41.051 --> 01:23:42.843
The hell you are

1885
01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:43.843
Grandpa!

1886
01:23:43.843 --> 01:23:47.843
Look, I am not letting her
out of my sight, ever again!


1887
01:23:47.843 --> 01:23:49.343
There's only room for one.

1888
01:23:50.343 --> 01:23:51.343
Well then, she ain't goin'.

1889
01:23:52.343 --> 01:23:53.343
Grandpa

1890
01:23:53.343 --> 01:23:55.801
this goes deeper than that.

1891
01:23:55.801 --> 01:23:57.843
We'll get you a good, Doc.

1892
01:23:57.843 --> 01:23:59.093
We'll get you fixed up.

1893
01:23:59.093 --> 01:24:00.968
My Memory is a bit hazy.

1894
01:24:00.968 --> 01:24:03.093
Once the hunger takes over

1895
01:24:03.093 --> 01:24:05.260
she'll turn into a robot

1896
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:08.593
Just like that brunette
at my brother's house.


1897
01:24:08.593 --> 01:24:09.593
Anything she eats

1898
01:24:09.593 --> 01:24:10.593
is going to turn to dust

1899
01:24:10.593 --> 01:24:11.593
Shit.

1900
01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:13.593
And she'll die from hunger.

1901
01:24:13.593 --> 01:24:14.593
Grandpa

1902
01:24:15.593 --> 01:24:16.801
All those legends you

1903
01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:17.801
told me as a kid

1904
01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:18.801
about this town

1905
01:24:18.801 --> 01:24:19.801
They're true.

1906
01:24:20.801 --> 01:24:22.885
I fuckin' knew it.

1907
01:24:22.885 --> 01:24:23.885
Too much

1908
01:24:23.885 --> 01:24:24.885
fucknuggetry going on

1909
01:24:24.885 --> 01:24:25.885
around here to be normal.

1910
01:24:29.801 --> 01:24:32.635
You have to let me go.

1911
01:24:32.635 --> 01:24:35.176
You touch a hair on her head

1912
01:24:35.176 --> 01:24:36.176
and I am going to gut

1913
01:24:36.176 --> 01:24:37.176
and skin you

1914
01:24:37.176 --> 01:24:38.176
like a deer

1915
01:24:38.176 --> 01:24:40.010
We on the same page?

1916
01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:42.010
Cuz, I'm and old motherfucker

1917
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.010
and the thing you need to

1918
01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:44.010
remember about

1919
01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:45.010
old motherfuckers

1920
01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:46.010
is we know how to fuckin'

1921
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:47.010
fight because we've been

1922
01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:48.010
doin' it longer than anybody

1923
01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:49.593
I hear you.

1924
01:24:49.593 --> 01:24:50.593
GOOD.

1925
01:24:51.593 --> 01:24:53.635
I love you Opa!

1926
01:24:53.635 --> 01:24:55.718
Oh Baby, I love you too.

1927
01:24:55.718 --> 01:24:58.051
You were the light of our twilight.

1928
01:24:58.051 --> 01:25:00.510
Don't you ever forget that, okay.

1929
01:25:02.926 --> 01:25:04.593
How do we...

1930
01:25:04.593 --> 01:25:07.551
Explain all this?

1931
01:25:07.551 --> 01:25:08.551
Yeah.

1932
01:25:15.218 --> 01:25:17.051
It's not my problem.

1933
01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:19.718
I should just take you
in right now.


1934
01:25:19.718 --> 01:25:22.843
You could try.

1935
01:25:22.843 --> 01:25:26.760
But, I wouldn't recommend it.

1936
01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.301
He's one of them.

1937
01:25:28.301 --> 01:25:29.301
What?

1938
01:25:29.301 --> 01:25:31.551
He rides a pale horse.

1939
01:25:31.551 --> 01:25:35.218
Sweetie, I don't know what
you're talking about.


1940
01:25:35.218 --> 01:25:36.968
Otis called himself famine.

1941
01:25:36.968 --> 01:25:37.968
They are...

1942
01:25:37.968 --> 01:25:40.968
The four horsemen of
the apocalypse?


1943
01:25:40.968 --> 01:25:43.718
Oooookay.

1944
01:25:43.718 --> 01:25:46.635
So, that makes John?

1945
01:25:46.635 --> 01:25:47.635
Death.

1946
01:25:47.635 --> 01:25:50.801
Sweetie, I am not letting you
go with this man.


1947
01:25:50.801 --> 01:25:53.301
It's her choice.

1948
01:25:53.301 --> 01:25:55.718
Only I can stop the hunger.

1949
01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:58.135
You can't keep me safe.

1950
01:25:58.135 --> 01:25:59.593
Or save me now.

1951
01:25:59.593 --> 01:26:01.760
But he can.

1952
01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.510
All due respect

1953
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:05.551
My granddaughter trusts this man.

1954
01:26:05.551 --> 01:26:07.635
And that means I trust this man.

1955
01:26:07.635 --> 01:26:08.635
Now

1956
01:26:08.635 --> 01:26:10.593
you seem like a nice lady

1957
01:26:10.593 --> 01:26:11.885
sort of

1958
01:26:11.885 --> 01:26:13.176
But I have every intention

1959
01:26:13.176 --> 01:26:14.176
of making sure that

1960
01:26:14.176 --> 01:26:15.843
these two leave together

1961
01:26:15.843 --> 01:26:17.051
and I ain't opposed to

1962
01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:19.010
hittin' a woman if she's armed.

1963
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:22.385
Okay, okay.

1964
01:26:22.385 --> 01:26:23.385
Fine.

1965
01:26:29.926 --> 01:26:30.926
Lordy.

1966
01:26:30.926 --> 01:26:34.301
I have never been more
disappointed


1967
01:26:34.301 --> 01:26:35.301
in one of my children

1968
01:26:35.301 --> 01:26:38.260
in my life.

1969
01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.260
Yes, she is very upset.

1970
01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:42.510
You have severely let
your Mama down.


1971
01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:43.510
Sorry Mama

1972
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:44.510
I tried to save him.

1973
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:46.051
Buford dear

1974
01:26:46.051 --> 01:26:48.468
please take care of my light work.

1975
01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:54.301
This is from your Mama

1976
01:26:54.301 --> 01:26:55.301
with love.

1977
01:26:56.843 --> 01:26:58.760
Don't lie to me, BOY.

1978
01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.760
I brought you into this world

1979
01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.843
I can take your slippery
ass out.


1980
01:27:01.843 --> 01:27:03.468
You can cast aspersions

1981
01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:04.968
on the mortals all you want

1982
01:27:04.968 --> 01:27:06.343
But don't you EVER

1983
01:27:06.343 --> 01:27:09.301
villify your mother with
a fabrication


1984
01:27:09.301 --> 01:27:11.218
Do you understand me?

1985
01:27:11.218 --> 01:27:13.551
Yes.....Mama

1986
01:27:14.551 --> 01:27:17.010
I should give you to Buford

1987
01:27:17.010 --> 01:27:19.385
As a toy

1988
01:27:19.385 --> 01:27:21.718
make you sit and take it.

1989
01:27:21.718 --> 01:27:24.176
I'd like that, Mama.

1990
01:27:24.176 --> 01:27:26.343
Calm your tits!

1991
01:27:27.343 --> 01:27:28.343
There are some lines

1992
01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:29.968
even a Mother can't cross.

1993
01:27:29.968 --> 01:27:32.218
But, I am this close, Otis.

1994
01:27:32.218 --> 01:27:33.510
Do you understand me?

1995
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:35.385
Yes....Mama

1996
01:27:35.385 --> 01:27:37.676
But, Mama what do you expect
me to do


1997
01:27:37.676 --> 01:27:40.051
there are only so many
trigger fingers out there


1998
01:27:40.051 --> 01:27:42.218
We don't need more.

1999
01:27:42.218 --> 01:27:45.218
We just need, one.

2000
01:27:48.885 --> 01:27:51.176
Have you met your son, Mama?

2001
01:27:51.176 --> 01:27:52.176
Yes.

2002
01:27:52.176 --> 01:27:53.885
I have.

2003
01:27:53.885 --> 01:27:55.468
Are you talking about yourself

2004
01:27:55.468 --> 01:27:56.468
because you are one

2005
01:27:56.468 --> 01:27:57.468
flaccid motherfucker

2006
01:27:57.468 --> 01:27:58.926
compared to the fat guy.

2007
01:27:58.926 --> 01:27:59.926
HEY!

2008
01:27:59.926 --> 01:28:00.968
Pretty, pretty princess

2009
01:28:00.968 --> 01:28:02.760
I can still cut a bitch.

2010
01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760
FOCUS!!!

2011
01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.135
Boys

2012
01:28:07.135 --> 01:28:08.926
I think its time to call that

2013
01:28:08.926 --> 01:28:10.510
bigger gun

2014
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:13.301
Who is this mythical beast?

2015
01:28:13.301 --> 01:28:14.968
Otis.

2016
01:28:14.968 --> 01:28:16.676
Call your brother.

2017
01:28:16.676 --> 01:28:17.676
Uh

2018
01:28:17.676 --> 01:28:20.093
Did I stutter?

2019
01:28:20.093 --> 01:28:21.093
But my

2020
01:28:21.093 --> 01:28:22.093
bride is still

2021
01:28:22.093 --> 01:28:23.093
out there uh

2022
01:28:23.093 --> 01:28:24.093
I just missed her at

2023
01:28:24.093 --> 01:28:25.093
grandparents home

2024
01:28:25.093 --> 01:28:26.093
uh

2025
01:28:26.093 --> 01:28:27.093
I expect she'll be home

2026
01:28:27.093 --> 01:28:28.093
anytime now.

2027
01:28:28.093 --> 01:28:29.718
Boy, you best get on that phone

2028
01:28:29.718 --> 01:28:31.093
and call your younger brother!

2029
01:28:35.718 --> 01:28:38.176
Yes, Mama.

2030
01:28:38.176 --> 01:28:40.010
Do you have any Jacks?

2031
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:42.343
Go fish.

2032
01:28:42.343 --> 01:28:45.551
Looks like I win.

2033
01:28:49.051 --> 01:28:51.093
Double or nothing.

2034
01:28:51.093 --> 01:28:52.093
Oh, I don't think that's

2035
01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:53.093
a good idea Lou

2036
01:28:53.093 --> 01:28:54.093
I mean, you need your rest.

2037
01:28:54.093 --> 01:28:55.093
And uh...

2038
01:28:55.093 --> 01:28:56.093
your whole quest

2039
01:28:56.093 --> 01:28:57.468
for world domination

2040
01:28:57.468 --> 01:28:59.385
failed in your dream

2041
01:28:59.385 --> 01:29:01.176
I have another son

2042
01:29:01.176 --> 01:29:04.301
Well you already lost one
in this fantasy


2043
01:29:04.301 --> 01:29:07.635
the other ones don't seem to
love you a whole lot.


2044
01:29:07.635 --> 01:29:09.801
If you win

2045
01:29:09.801 --> 01:29:11.885
I'll take my pills

2046
01:29:11.885 --> 01:29:13.510
Well....

2047
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:16.010
What do you get if you win?

2048
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:18.135
Then I get out of this hell hole!

2049
01:29:21.718 --> 01:29:23.718
I don't know if I can promise that.

2050
01:29:23.718 --> 01:29:25.968
C'mon, don't you wanna know
how the story ends?


2051
01:29:25.968 --> 01:29:27.343
Well... okay.

2052
01:29:27.343 --> 01:29:30.801
But, what's the game? I've about
had it with Go Fish.


2053
01:29:32.551 --> 01:29:33.843
How about war?

2054
01:29:42.551 --> 01:29:44.301
Fuck off. I'm busy.

2055
01:29:44.301 --> 01:29:45.843
Is it John?

2056
01:29:46.843 --> 01:29:48.385
I'm on my way.

2057
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:53.510
Ahh...

2058
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:54.510
I hopeyou fellas don't mind

2059
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:55.135
fightin' women

2060
01:29:58.676 --> 01:29:59.676
It's your unlucky day.

2061
01:29:59.676 --> 01:30:09.676
End credit music

2062
01:30:10.301 --> 01:30:11.301
FUCK!

2063
01:30:11.301 --> 01:30:12.301
End credit music

2064
01:30:12.301 --> 01:30:13.801
Got any fives?

2065
01:30:13.801 --> 01:30:14.801
End credit music

2066
01:30:14.801 --> 01:30:17.176
Can I interest you in some
primo meth?


2067
01:30:19.885 --> 01:30:22.926
Can I interest you in some

2068
01:30:22.926 --> 01:30:25.218
primo...

2069
01:30:26.218 --> 01:30:29.760
This is why we're partners.

2070
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.343
That is for the prequel

2071
01:30:34.885 --> 01:30:37.426
Now, I'll never
be a model.


2072
01:30:37.426 --> 01:30:41.260
Oooh, just let me take him out.
Just let me take him out!


2073
01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:44.551
You don't get to kill me!

2074
01:30:44.551 --> 01:30:46.051
Oh my God!

2075
01:30:52.301 --> 01:30:53.301
What the fuck you doin'?

2076
01:30:53.301 --> 01:30:55.051
Well... I... uh...
