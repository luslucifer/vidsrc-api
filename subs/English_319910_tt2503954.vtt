1
00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:16.458
Buddy.

2
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:18.491
Hey.

3
00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:23.304
What's with the grin, pal?

4
00:01:25.262 --> 00:01:30.041
Mr. Castillo said I did a good job.
He even gave me an extra dollar.


5
00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:31.541
Yeah?

6
00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.079
So, that's your first paycheck, pal.
You never forget that.


7
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:41.712
I told him to make it in three parts.
For you, me, and Jakey.


8
00:01:41.812 --> 00:01:42.780
Smart.

9
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.249
Jakey gets the extra dollar,
'cause he's the youngest.


10
00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.384
Well, that he is.

11
00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:49.794
Or I could get him a new violin.

12
00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:53.524
For six bucks? I doubt it.

13
00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:55.570
But I'll tell you what.

14
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.969
You give Jakey that six bucks
and I'll throw in the fiddle for free.


15
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.077
Jakey'll go bananas. Bananas!

16
00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:07.944
Yeah, he will.

17
00:02:08.138 --> 00:02:09.981
Here, you want to
take her for a spin?

18
00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:11.175
Okay.

19
00:02:25.656 --> 00:02:27.966
Those kids that call you slow...

20
00:02:29.193 --> 00:02:30.194
Yeah.

21
00:02:30.828 --> 00:02:32.865
They should see you shoot, boy.

22
00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:35.801
Get that target there.

23
00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:43.507
Do you think if I keep shooting good,
that I could get a star, too?


24
00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:46.118
Sure, son.

25
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:48.590
Then we could be partners?

26
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.259
We are partners.

27
00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:55.227
But then I'd have
to shoot people, right?


28
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.360
You might.

29
00:02:59.423 --> 00:03:01.198
I'm not sure I'd like that.

30
00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:06.071
Well, I don't like it, either, Buddy,
but there's a lot of bad people out there.


31
00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:10.644
Somebody's gotta stop 'em.
You know, if everybody said,


32
00:03:11.235 --> 00:03:13.112
"I'm not gonna do that job," then...

33
00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:16.109
Well, who would stop 'em?

34
00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:23.987
Man, that is some talent
you got there, kid.


35
00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:26.787
Jakey's also talented.

36
00:03:27.418 --> 00:03:29.056
You've got two talented sons.

37
00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:33.257
Well, Mr. Ashman says
he saw that talented brother of yours


38
00:03:33.357 --> 00:03:35.860
out on his property again yesterday.

39
00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:39.701
With a slingshot.

40
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.032
Jakey never left the house.

41
00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:45.045
He was at home playing checkers with me
the whole afternoon.


42
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.707
Buddy, why do you always
gotta protect your brother?


43
00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:51.383
'Cause he always lets me
win at checkers.


44
00:03:57.481 --> 00:04:00.655
Pop, we're gonna miss Jakey's recital.

45
00:04:01.452 --> 00:04:03.398
No, we got plenty of time.

46
00:04:46.663 --> 00:04:47.835
Jakey.

47
00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.956
They say the kitchen's closed.

48
00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:12.716
I can get you a coffee.

49
00:06:12.816 --> 00:06:15.057
I lost my daddy, too,
when I was a boy.

50
00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:20.196
I showed up at work. 
Just like you.

51
00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:22.468
To support the family.

52
00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:27.308
But I couldn't get my daddy
out of my head.


53
00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:31.202
How did he die?

54
00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:35.143
Somebody shoot him?

55
00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:36.613
Yes.

56
00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:39.952
A bad man.

57
00:06:41.712 --> 00:06:44.556
I met that man once, too.
In the drug store.


58
00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:49.364
He stopped and smiled at me.

59
00:06:50.187 --> 00:06:51.928
I did nothing.

60
00:06:53.457 --> 00:06:54.663
Nothing.

61
00:06:58.095 --> 00:07:01.508
And that kills me to this day.

62
00:07:01.765 --> 00:07:03.005
You know?

63
00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:07.377
Sit down, boy.

64
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.510
Listen.

65
00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.856
That man who killed your father,
he won't get away. No, son, he won't.


66
00:07:20.117 --> 00:07:23.189
I want you to read that out.

67
00:07:27.758 --> 00:07:29.359
"Miguel Santion."

68
00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:30.733
Yes.

69
00:07:32.496 --> 00:07:34.237
You know him?

70
00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:37.646
Take a good look.

71
00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:40.806
He's the one.

72
00:07:42.472 --> 00:07:44.713
He killed your daddy.

73
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:48.287
Now, you cannot let him get away.

74
00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:51.120
Kill him.

75
00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:56.756
- I can't.
- You can't?


76
00:07:58.355 --> 00:08:00.198
I don't know where he lives.

77
00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:04.068
You don't know where he...

78
00:08:07.197 --> 00:08:10.770
Why, I can find him for you.
That's not a...


79
00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:14.311
Look, I want you to take this.
Go ahead, son.


80
00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:16.348
Pick it up.

81
00:08:24.214 --> 00:08:25.659
That's my father's.

82
00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:31.562
Did you earn it like your daddy?

83
00:08:33.023 --> 00:08:35.094
No, I don't think you did.

84
00:08:36.393 --> 00:08:39.101
I think you got it because he died.

85
00:08:41.064 --> 00:08:44.443
I think your daddy
would want you to earn it?


86
00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:46.670
Earn this.

87
00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:52.283
You earn it and I'll pin it
on you myself.


88
00:08:54.244 --> 00:08:56.053
You understand me?

89
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.723
Yeah.

90
00:08:58.148 --> 00:08:59.957
I understand.

91
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.166
I'm sorry for bothering you
so late, ma'am.


92
00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:51.068
But I need to speak to Mr. Santion...

93
00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:52.579
Who the fuck are you?

94
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:57.113
I'm Buddy. I work at the diner.

95
00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:01.451
Don't move!
Don't you fucking move, retard!


96
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.293
What are you doing with my picture,
you stupid fuck?


97
00:10:13.056 --> 00:10:14.865
I was just making sure it was you.

98
00:10:31.608 --> 00:10:35.012
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you, Mr. Hench.


99
00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:36.853
Call me Julius, son.

100
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.499
- Jakey's had his supper.
- Thanks, Ignacio.


101
00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:14.793
Jakey, I ain't coming to school no more.

102
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.558
I got a new job.

103
00:11:19.489 --> 00:11:21.662
So, I can take care of us.

104
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.265
Tell me about the ranch.

105
00:11:28.365 --> 00:11:31.902
Well, it'll be just you and me,

106
00:11:32.002 --> 00:11:34.071
and our house on the lake.

107
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:35.707
Are there horses?

108
00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:40.553
Are you kidding me?
What's a ranch without horses, dummy?


109
00:11:42.312 --> 00:11:47.022
I'll get you a white stallion,
with a red tanned saddle.


110
00:11:47.484 --> 00:11:48.554
All your own.

111
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.157
- Swear?
- Swear.


112
00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:54.832
You just play your violin, okay?

113
00:11:57.127 --> 00:12:00.631
Ignacio said, if I play real good,

114
00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:03.542
Pop can hear it.

115
00:13:01.057 --> 00:13:03.293
They said they'd let me know.

116
00:13:03.393 --> 00:13:06.431
"Don't call us, we'll call you."

117
00:13:07.497 --> 00:13:09.166
I should've played Bach.

118
00:13:09.266 --> 00:13:11.334
But you love Paganini.

119
00:13:11.434 --> 00:13:13.470
I fell in love with you
when you played Paganini.


120
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.743
Yeah, well, they didn't.

121
00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:22.247
Why don't you just bring it to the wedding?
I'll get you a ticket.


122
00:13:25.415 --> 00:13:29.488
Buddy, I can't. I'm sorry.
I told you, I just can't, okay?


123
00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:32.226
I will tell her, Buds. Bye.

124
00:13:33.223 --> 00:13:34.424
Tell her what?

125
00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:36.868
Buddy wants me to come home.

126
00:13:37.427 --> 00:13:40.601
He got us a present.
He says he can't bring it to the wedding.


127
00:13:41.097 --> 00:13:42.576
That's so cute.

128
00:13:43.466 --> 00:13:45.535
He never asks for anything.

129
00:13:45.635 --> 00:13:47.615
- He's your brother.
- Yeah, I know that.


130
00:13:48.872 --> 00:13:52.786
It's like a different planet back there,
you know?


131
00:13:53.376 --> 00:13:57.017
And how do you know?
You haven't been back for ages.


132
00:13:59.015 --> 00:14:00.050
Go.

133
00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:03.492
Yeah, it's been eight years.

134
00:14:05.455 --> 00:14:06.695
You wanna come with me?

135
00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:13.036
Can you please just go meet your brother
so I can finish fixing this place up?


136
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:17.438
No. Not a chance.

137
00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:50.529
Hey.

138
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.880
You look good.

139
00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:07.013
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


140
00:16:08.945 --> 00:16:10.747
- Yeah...
- No. Really, you look good.


141
00:16:10.847 --> 00:16:13.123
I got a haircut.

142
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.893
Yeah? Yeah, I can see that.

143
00:16:22.392 --> 00:16:25.339
That's Eric. That's Eric.

144
00:16:25.562 --> 00:16:27.599
He's my bestest friend.

145
00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:30.903
Yeah.

146
00:16:32.102 --> 00:16:33.581
Hey, Jakey.

147
00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:42.118
Like Pop had Joe, I have Eric.

148
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.825
Welcome home, kid.

149
00:16:47.884 --> 00:16:49.261
Well, let's go.

150
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.556
- Hey, Jake, will you tell me...
- What?


151
00:16:53.656 --> 00:16:54.964
Where'd it go?

152
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:57.560
Yeah, will you tell me
how this sounds real fast?


153
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.096
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.
- Listen.


154
00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:05.009
Ladies and gentlemen, I won't take long.
It's the best day of my life.


155
00:17:08.371 --> 00:17:10.112
What is it?

156
00:17:10.874 --> 00:17:12.410
It's a speech, dummy.

157
00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:15.578
- For your wedding. It's a wedding speech.
- Of course.


158
00:17:15.678 --> 00:17:17.080
Of course, it's a wedding speech, yeah.

159
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.218
- Well, is it good?
- Yeah, well, let me hear the rest of it.


160
00:17:22.018 --> 00:17:23.964
That's all I got so far.

161
00:17:24.787 --> 00:17:26.824
It's only seven seconds.

162
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.462
What am I gonna do, Jakey?

163
00:17:32.562 --> 00:17:36.199
Why don't you tell 'em a story?
Like, about when we were kids?


164
00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:38.268
A lot of good stories
from when we were kids.


165
00:17:38.368 --> 00:17:39.402
Yeah, you know, I know!

166
00:17:39.502 --> 00:17:41.538
You know, I'll tell them
about the time that I jumped in the pool


167
00:17:41.638 --> 00:17:43.373
and I broke your Lincoln Log house

168
00:17:43.473 --> 00:17:45.408
- and you were crying like a little girl.
- Yeah!


169
00:17:45.508 --> 00:17:47.610
- You remember that?
- Yeah, right. Yeah, I remember that, yeah.


170
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.679
You took those logs,
I didn't see them for weeks.


171
00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:53.283
- Yeah.
- You said you were gonna fix that house.


172
00:17:53.383 --> 00:17:55.488
Yeah, I did fix it, though, didn't I?

173
00:17:55.985 --> 00:17:57.726
- You did, yeah.
- Didn't I?


174
00:17:59.189 --> 00:18:01.294
Yeah, Buds. You did.

175
00:18:03.092 --> 00:18:04.994
Yeah, that's a great story, Jakey.

176
00:18:05.094 --> 00:18:06.937
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


177
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.042
Yeah, they'll go bananas for that one.

178
00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:17.907
Hey, Jakey,
how many kids you planning on having?


179
00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:20.310
I don't know, Buds. 
That's a ways off.

180
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.012
You know, I'm gonna quit my job
and look after them kids.


181
00:18:23.112 --> 00:18:24.489
Yeah, sure thing, Buds.

182
00:18:25.481 --> 00:18:28.223
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.


183
00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:30.787
You got to do
me a favor one second.

184
00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:33.527
- Yeah, I'll do anything.
- You got to close your eyes.


185
00:18:34.023 --> 00:18:36.299
- Really?
- Yeah. Close your eyes.


186
00:18:36.693 --> 00:18:38.128
You want a surprise, or not? Close 'em.

187
00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:39.832
- All right, all right, all right.
- Come on!


188
00:18:42.131 --> 00:18:43.667
Okay, open 'em!

189
00:18:53.977 --> 00:18:55.183
Buds,

190
00:18:56.779 --> 00:18:58.258
what is this?

191
00:19:00.383 --> 00:19:03.193
A promise is a promise, Jakey.

192
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:08.997
Well, how do you like your wedding gift?

193
00:19:13.329 --> 00:19:14.569
Come on.

194
00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:20.470
Hey, this is my room. 
Right in here.

195
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.040
And your room's over here.
Let me show it to you. Come here.


196
00:19:24.641 --> 00:19:27.577
Buds, where did you get
all the money for this?


197
00:19:27.677 --> 00:19:31.682
I've been working real hard, Jakey.

198
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:34.392
Real hard.

199
00:19:35.785 --> 00:19:38.955
You know, my boss,
he saves my money up good.


200
00:19:39.055 --> 00:19:42.692
When I told him I was quitting my job
to look after your kids,


201
00:19:42.792 --> 00:19:45.068
you should have seen his face.

202
00:19:45.662 --> 00:19:46.732
He looked...

203
00:19:49.032 --> 00:19:50.978
You still work at the theater, right?

204
00:19:51.968 --> 00:19:54.073
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:19:55.471 --> 00:19:57.574
Hey, you know
what the best part about that is?


206
00:19:57.674 --> 00:20:00.280
I get to see
all the movies for free.

207
00:20:00.476 --> 00:20:01.678
I tell you that before?

208
00:20:01.778 --> 00:20:05.123
I'm sure gonna miss that. Come here.
I'm gonna put this in your room.


209
00:20:06.449 --> 00:20:10.659
See, Jakey, you get the best room
'cause you're the youngest.


210
00:20:43.653 --> 00:20:45.462
- Hey.
- Hey.


211
00:20:46.122 --> 00:20:47.123
Yeah?

212
00:20:47.223 --> 00:20:48.930
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


213
00:20:49.892 --> 00:20:52.362
- Look at that.
- Yeah, my boss got it for me.


214
00:20:52.462 --> 00:20:53.998
You know, for your wedding.

215
00:20:54.831 --> 00:20:58.901
Yeah, you know, he told the tailor...

216
00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:01.982
- Your boss goes with you to the tailor, Buds?
- No, dummy, no.


217
00:21:02.105 --> 00:21:04.278
The tailor comes to him.

218
00:21:06.109 --> 00:21:08.911
Listen. You know, he told the tailor

219
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:11.814
that if I wasn't the bestest-looking man
at your wedding,


220
00:21:11.914 --> 00:21:13.518
there'd be a lot of trouble.

221
00:21:14.684 --> 00:21:15.958
A lot of trouble.

222
00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:20.996
He was just kidding.

223
00:21:21.391 --> 00:21:23.526
- No, I know. I know.
- That was a joke.


224
00:21:23.626 --> 00:21:26.664
He seems like a really, really nice man.

225
00:21:27.096 --> 00:21:30.133
- Yeah.
- When do you think I can meet him?


226
00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:32.001
Tomorrow.

227
00:21:32.101 --> 00:21:33.970
Yeah, you know,
he said that after church


228
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.673
that he's gonna take us out to dinner
at El Cortez,


229
00:21:36.773 --> 00:21:38.878
just like Pop used to, remember?

230
00:21:39.308 --> 00:21:40.753
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


231
00:21:43.146 --> 00:21:44.352
Great.

232
00:21:45.548 --> 00:21:48.154
Buds, you think
I could take your car for a drive?


233
00:21:50.153 --> 00:21:52.030
Right now? Yeah.

234
00:21:52.989 --> 00:21:54.093
Here.

235
00:21:56.092 --> 00:21:59.335
- Just don't take long, okay? Please.
- I won't, I won't.


236
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.464
Ignacio?

237
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:23.185
Ignacio?

238
00:23:32.088 --> 00:23:33.726
Jakey Heckum!

239
00:23:36.092 --> 00:23:38.902
Jakey! Jakey Heckum!

240
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.076
Why did you come back, Jakey?
Why did you...


241
00:23:48.204 --> 00:23:49.615
Go away, Jakey.

242
00:23:50.406 --> 00:23:53.615
What happened? 
What happened to you?

243
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.653
I saved my hands, Jakey.

244
00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:04.296
I saved my hands
so I could still play.

245
00:24:04.954 --> 00:24:06.627
But the music...

246
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.427
The music's gone, Jakey.

247
00:24:12.228 --> 00:24:14.597
The music just stopped.

248
00:24:14.697 --> 00:24:18.235
The fire's the only thing I hear.

249
00:24:18.367 --> 00:24:21.246
And the animal is scared of fire.

250
00:24:22.038 --> 00:24:23.745
Who is scared of fire?

251
00:24:25.741 --> 00:24:28.381
Hench is scared of fire.

252
00:24:30.313 --> 00:24:33.590
What's going on here, Ignacio?
What happened?


253
00:24:36.352 --> 00:24:37.831
Two legs

254
00:24:40.222 --> 00:24:43.066
for two train tickets.

255
00:24:46.896 --> 00:24:48.239
Julius Hench

256
00:24:48.798 --> 00:24:50.038
gave me a choice.

257
00:24:50.499 --> 00:24:53.275
Two hands, or two legs.

258
00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:55.314
That's two for two tickets.

259
00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:00.181
Legs!

260
00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.880
Legs!

261
00:25:56.599 --> 00:25:58.579
God! Fuck!

262
00:26:09.545 --> 00:26:11.286
You just tried to kill me.

263
00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:15.224
Why?

264
00:26:16.585 --> 00:26:17.825
I had to.

265
00:26:18.821 --> 00:26:20.198
I was told.

266
00:26:21.991 --> 00:26:25.529
Buddy was quitting because of you.

267
00:26:26.495 --> 00:26:30.500
Nobody leaves Hench.
Definitely not Buddy.


268
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.946
Hench loves the kid.

269
00:26:34.136 --> 00:26:36.272
You shouldn't have never have come back.

270
00:26:36.372 --> 00:26:38.181
But it's not too late.

271
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.752
Give me the phone
and get away from this town.


272
00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:42.454
I won't say a word.

273
00:26:43.546 --> 00:26:44.991
- Hey...
- Give me the phone.


274
00:26:46.682 --> 00:26:48.161
Give it to me!

275
00:26:48.818 --> 00:26:51.621
Move your fucking feet
the fuck over here


276
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:53.200
and give me the phone.

277
00:26:55.057 --> 00:26:57.264
Give it to me
or I'll blow your fucking head off.


278
00:26:58.461 --> 00:26:59.667
Toss it!

279
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.074
Is he dead, or do I have
to buy him dinner?


280
00:27:08.237 --> 00:27:09.580
Don't.

281
00:27:12.007 --> 00:27:15.111
I hear you breathing.
Talk to me, son. You okay?


282
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:17.088
What's going on there? 
Where are you at?

283
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.181
Don't.

284
00:27:19.281 --> 00:27:20.351
Eric!

285
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.385
Talk to me, Eric!

286
00:27:22.485 --> 00:27:25.728
I'll send someone over there!
Where are you at?


287
00:27:26.021 --> 00:27:27.056
Miners...

288
00:27:28.457 --> 00:27:31.370
Eric! Eric!

289
00:27:32.628 --> 00:27:33.936
You okay, son?

290
00:27:35.898 --> 00:27:37.434
- Shit!
- Eric!


291
00:28:02.391 --> 00:28:04.260
Jacob?

292
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.341
Take a deep breath. Ready?

293
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.467
The Philharmonic wrote!
You got the job, baby!


294
00:28:11.567 --> 00:28:14.103
You did it! Can you believe it?

295
00:28:14.203 --> 00:28:17.116
I'm so happy for you! So happy!

296
00:28:18.974 --> 00:28:21.181
Come home quick, okay?

297
00:28:53.042 --> 00:28:54.112
Buds?

298
00:28:56.045 --> 00:28:58.184
Vittoria called. 
She wants us to...

299
00:28:59.114 --> 00:29:01.617
They killed Eric!

300
00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:04.523
What?

301
00:29:04.954 --> 00:29:06.991
They killed him!

302
00:29:07.823 --> 00:29:08.858
Who?

303
00:29:09.859 --> 00:29:11.794
Do they know who did it?

304
00:29:11.894 --> 00:29:12.928
Yeah.

305
00:29:13.028 --> 00:29:14.166
Who?

306
00:29:15.297 --> 00:29:16.708
Who, Buds?

307
00:29:19.101 --> 00:29:20.669
A bad man.

308
00:29:20.769 --> 00:29:23.038
Who, Buds? Who? 
Who killed him?

309
00:29:23.138 --> 00:29:26.509
They killed my brother.

310
00:29:26.609 --> 00:29:27.952
They killed my partner!

311
00:29:29.378 --> 00:29:32.916
Buddy. Buds, it'll be okay.

312
00:29:33.682 --> 00:29:35.251
- It'll be all right.
- No, it won't.


313
00:29:35.351 --> 00:29:36.955
- Yeah.
- No.


314
00:29:38.254 --> 00:29:42.396
- It will, Buds.
- I'll get him. I'll get him, Jakey.


315
00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:46.672
Buds. Hey, Buds. 
Buds, listen to me.

316
00:29:47.396 --> 00:29:49.431
I want you to come with me.

317
00:29:49.531 --> 00:29:52.134
- I got a job at the Philharmonic...
- No, I can't go with you now.


318
00:29:52.234 --> 00:29:53.769
I can't go with you now!

319
00:29:53.869 --> 00:29:57.214
I gotta find that bad man
and I gotta crack his skull in!


320
00:29:58.507 --> 00:30:00.316
Do you understand?

321
00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:05.920
Buds, the cops will handle it.

322
00:30:06.582 --> 00:30:08.918
No, they won't. 
No, they won't.

323
00:30:09.018 --> 00:30:13.592
Do you think they got the guy who shot Pop?
You think they got him?


324
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.928
No, Jakey!

325
00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:18.436
I did!

326
00:30:28.671 --> 00:30:29.809
I did.

327
00:30:40.749 --> 00:30:42.057
Bud.

328
00:30:59.168 --> 00:31:02.274
There's a lot of bad people
out there, Jakey.


329
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:08.988
And somebody's gotta stop them.

330
00:31:10.612 --> 00:31:12.649
Did Hench tell you that?

331
00:31:14.516 --> 00:31:15.756
Yeah.

332
00:31:18.454 --> 00:31:20.957
If Hench told you
I was a bad man...

333
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:23.870
Me.

334
00:31:25.327 --> 00:31:26.738
Would you believe him?

335
00:31:26.962 --> 00:31:28.397
He would never say that.

336
00:31:28.497 --> 00:31:31.634
- He would never say that.
- He's not a good man, okay?


337
00:31:31.734 --> 00:31:33.102
- He's not a good man.
- Yes, he is!


338
00:31:33.202 --> 00:31:35.037
- You don't understand Julius!
- You don't understand, Buds!


339
00:31:35.137 --> 00:31:36.810
You don't understand!

340
00:31:40.609 --> 00:31:43.681
When I was driving,
I backed into a fence post, okay?


341
00:31:43.812 --> 00:31:45.014
So, if anyone asks what we were doing,

342
00:31:45.114 --> 00:31:46.916
I was playing checkers
with you all night, okay?


343
00:31:47.016 --> 00:31:48.256
Buds?

344
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.668
- Hey!
- Don't cry.


345
00:31:59.028 --> 00:32:01.838
I'm with you now. 
I'm with you now, son.

346
00:32:02.564 --> 00:32:04.544
Hey, don't cry.

347
00:32:08.337 --> 00:32:11.978
Hey. Let's have a sit down. Come on.

348
00:32:22.551 --> 00:32:24.087
Read it out.

349
00:32:28.624 --> 00:32:30.865
"Mario Garza."

350
00:32:31.894 --> 00:32:33.396
He's the one.

351
00:32:35.297 --> 00:32:37.436
He robbed us in our corridor.

352
00:32:40.402 --> 00:32:45.078
And then he hunted down and he killed Eric.
Your friend, your brother.


353
00:32:45.674 --> 00:32:47.476
You see, he's not one of our kind.

354
00:32:47.576 --> 00:32:49.817
He's a bad man.

355
00:32:50.546 --> 00:32:53.720
And what are we gonna do about him?

356
00:32:55.184 --> 00:32:56.686
You know where he lives?

357
00:32:57.086 --> 00:32:59.388
Yeah. He's across the border.
He's well protected.


358
00:32:59.488 --> 00:33:01.764
We got to get you there
and get you back.


359
00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:06.196
No! No, just get me to him.
I don't care about getting back.


360
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.038
Son.

361
00:33:13.335 --> 00:33:14.837
God damn!

362
00:33:15.804 --> 00:33:17.249
That's my boy.

363
00:33:19.708 --> 00:33:22.484
This will be your last job.

364
00:33:23.278 --> 00:33:25.884
After this, you can go live
with your brother.


365
00:33:26.014 --> 00:33:28.392
Yeah? Okay.

366
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.200
Where is he at?

367
00:33:35.591 --> 00:33:37.969
He's... Hey, Jakey?

368
00:33:42.865 --> 00:33:44.845
Julius wants to see you.

369
00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:48.075
Jakey!

370
00:33:54.743 --> 00:33:56.381
Jakey. Julius.

371
00:33:58.847 --> 00:34:00.758
I didn't think you'd be here.

372
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.227
Yeah, I was just

373
00:34:04.286 --> 00:34:06.232
playing checkers with Buds.

374
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:09.758
Who won that game of checkers, Buddy?

375
00:34:09.858 --> 00:34:11.030
I did.

376
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.506
I always lick Jakey at checkers.

377
00:34:23.939 --> 00:34:25.919
Well, welcome home, kid.

378
00:34:27.176 --> 00:34:30.589
Thank you, Mr. Hench. Thank you.

379
00:34:44.526 --> 00:34:46.802
Buddy's gonna die.

380
00:34:47.563 --> 00:34:50.305
They're sending him across.
I have to get him out.


381
00:34:51.033 --> 00:34:52.137
Out?

382
00:34:53.635 --> 00:34:56.411
Hench's wife tried to get out.

383
00:34:57.539 --> 00:34:59.348
Ran off with their son.

384
00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:03.790
I was his music teacher.

385
00:35:05.747 --> 00:35:07.317
I got her train tickets.

386
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.323
Two train tickets.

387
00:35:12.721 --> 00:35:14.325
What does Hench do?

388
00:35:19.795 --> 00:35:21.206
He burns 'em both alive.

389
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.780
You want Buddy out?

390
00:35:29.738 --> 00:35:31.945
There's only one way to do it.

391
00:35:36.378 --> 00:35:39.114
You see that mountain?

392
00:35:39.214 --> 00:35:41.956
They're gonna take it down
to get the silver out.


393
00:35:42.517 --> 00:35:46.693
They're gonna tunnel in, they're gonna
blow it up from the inside out.


394
00:35:49.558 --> 00:35:51.629
That's how you get Hench.

395
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.196
From the inside out.

396
00:35:54.296 --> 00:35:57.106
Just like he took down your daddy.

397
00:35:57.966 --> 00:36:01.140
It was an inside job, Jakey.

398
00:36:02.104 --> 00:36:06.052
Your father's partner, Joe,
he just looked the other way.


399
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.980
You were performing
your first solo, Jakey.


400
00:36:13.382 --> 00:36:15.862
Hench was conducting
your daddy's requiem.


401
00:36:31.066 --> 00:36:33.205
- I'm gonna go talk to Joe.
- Okay.


402
00:36:49.084 --> 00:36:50.324
Thank you for coming by, Joe.

403
00:36:50.452 --> 00:36:51.795
See you, Julius.

404
00:36:56.158 --> 00:36:57.899
Mr. Hench.

405
00:36:59.695 --> 00:37:01.834
You took care of Buddy all these years.

406
00:37:04.166 --> 00:37:07.045
I'm very grateful to you for that.

407
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.607
I want to ask you one more favor.

408
00:37:13.308 --> 00:37:14.912
If you'd let me,

409
00:37:16.011 --> 00:37:18.184
I'd like to take Eric's place.

410
00:37:21.883 --> 00:37:25.421
If you send Buddy across the fence,
I wanna go with him.


411
00:37:25.787 --> 00:37:27.562
I wanna be his partner.

412
00:37:29.424 --> 00:37:31.836
What about your life in New York?

413
00:37:32.694 --> 00:37:35.903
New York made me forget
what I promised my father.


414
00:37:37.966 --> 00:37:42.244
Kept me away from home,
kept me away from Buddy.


415
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:50.921
You know, my brother dropped out
of school to take care of me.


416
00:37:51.413 --> 00:37:53.586
So I could play the violin.

417
00:37:54.716 --> 00:37:56.652
What did I do?

418
00:37:56.752 --> 00:38:00.962
Every couple of years, he'd come visit me.
I'd take him to the Central Park Zoo.


419
00:38:03.692 --> 00:38:06.138
And he was so grateful.

420
00:38:08.263 --> 00:38:10.709
All he asked in return is that

421
00:38:11.633 --> 00:38:14.944
I come see him,
I come and spend some time with him.


422
00:38:17.406 --> 00:38:18.976
But I didn't.

423
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:23.184
I...

424
00:38:24.646 --> 00:38:26.421
I abandoned him.

425
00:38:30.118 --> 00:38:33.565
I'm back now and I'd like
to be a real brother.


426
00:38:34.856 --> 00:38:37.996
Sir, I love Buddy
and I wanna take care of him.


427
00:38:40.429 --> 00:38:42.466
We'll talk at the Alamo.

428
00:38:44.499 --> 00:38:46.479
I promised Buddy I'd buy you dinner.

429
00:39:19.701 --> 00:39:23.513
I like vegetarians.
It's humane. No blood.


430
00:39:24.473 --> 00:39:25.543
Hey!

431
00:39:27.843 --> 00:39:29.948
He eats fish.

432
00:39:30.445 --> 00:39:31.580
Okay?

433
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.921
You tell him that you eat fish.

434
00:39:35.851 --> 00:39:38.855
Why don't you make him
a plate of fish, Buddy?


435
00:39:53.134 --> 00:39:56.411
Some cowboy shot Eric with his own gun.

436
00:40:13.021 --> 00:40:14.762
But it's yours now.

437
00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:20.235
After your audition.

438
00:40:20.795 --> 00:40:22.564
You got his audition set up, Franco?

439
00:40:22.664 --> 00:40:23.836
Yup.

440
00:40:37.812 --> 00:40:39.223
Hey, where's Jakey?

441
00:40:39.681 --> 00:40:41.024
He went on his audition.

442
00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:44.989
Hey.

443
00:40:46.087 --> 00:40:49.762
Do you think he's gonna pass that test?
Do you?


444
00:40:51.192 --> 00:40:52.933
He's gonna fail it.

445
00:40:55.196 --> 00:40:57.836
Hey, light me a cigar. Come on.

446
00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:46.924
Ignacio?

447
00:41:48.683 --> 00:41:50.356
Jakey Heckum.

448
00:41:50.986 --> 00:41:53.557
Now, I know why you came back, Jakey.

449
00:41:57.359 --> 00:41:59.965
You came back to set me free.

450
00:42:00.095 --> 00:42:01.574
I can't. I can't kill you.

451
00:42:04.032 --> 00:42:06.171
You're inside the mountain, Jakey.

452
00:42:06.835 --> 00:42:08.314
Take it down!

453
00:42:09.304 --> 00:42:10.977
Blow it up, Jakey.

454
00:42:11.806 --> 00:42:13.508
You put that gun to my head

455
00:42:13.608 --> 00:42:16.179
and you blow my fucking brains out!

456
00:42:16.645 --> 00:42:17.680
No.

457
00:42:18.813 --> 00:42:21.483
Do you think I like cursing?

458
00:42:21.583 --> 00:42:24.757
Pissing on God every single day, Jakey?

459
00:42:26.521 --> 00:42:28.865
My life is a fucking joke.

460
00:42:31.493 --> 00:42:32.631
This...

461
00:42:33.995 --> 00:42:37.875
This, Jakey, has meaning. This.

462
00:42:40.001 --> 00:42:42.174
- Pull the trigger, Jakey.
- No. No.


463
00:42:42.337 --> 00:42:44.673
- Pull the trigger! Jakey, pull it!
- No, no, no!


464
00:42:44.773 --> 00:42:46.377
- No!
- Please!


465
00:42:47.008 --> 00:42:48.743
I'll show you. I have hands, Jakey!

466
00:42:48.843 --> 00:42:50.378
I have hands!

467
00:42:50.478 --> 00:42:51.923
No!

468
00:43:24.245 --> 00:43:26.122
You know that night

469
00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.119
when I jumped in the pool

470
00:43:31.219 --> 00:43:33.563
and I broke your ranch?

471
00:43:35.724 --> 00:43:38.432
And you were so cross with me?

472
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:44.307
And Pop talked to you?

473
00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:49.380
See, I wasn't sleeping.

474
00:43:52.674 --> 00:43:54.085
I heard him.

475
00:43:56.211 --> 00:43:57.554
He said,

476
00:43:59.647 --> 00:44:00.921
"Jakey,

477
00:44:03.218 --> 00:44:05.994
"you came into this world after Buddy,

478
00:44:06.821 --> 00:44:09.165
"but you gotta be the big brother.

479
00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:13.428
"And you can't hold nothing
against Buddy


480
00:44:13.528 --> 00:44:16.270
"'cause he doesn't understand
what he's doing."


481
00:44:19.434 --> 00:44:22.278
You promised him you'd take care of me.

482
00:44:27.675 --> 00:44:29.518
I know you're keeping your promise.

483
00:44:32.547 --> 00:44:33.515
I know.

484
00:44:33.615 --> 00:44:37.153
That's why you joined.

485
00:44:40.421 --> 00:44:41.866
To take care of me.

486
00:44:57.539 --> 00:45:01.077
Jacob, why aren't you picking up?

487
00:45:04.846 --> 00:45:06.086
The Philharmonic,

488
00:45:07.382 --> 00:45:09.384
they won't wait forever.

489
00:45:10.318 --> 00:45:12.889
I don't know how to
get a hold of Buddy.

490
00:45:13.822 --> 00:45:15.859
I've called a million times.

491
00:45:20.261 --> 00:45:22.468
My imagination's running wild.

492
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.612
Please, just let me know
you're all right.


493
00:45:28.169 --> 00:45:29.170
Just...

494
00:45:30.772 --> 00:45:32.376
Just call, okay?

495
00:45:35.443 --> 00:45:36.820
I love you.

496
00:45:40.982 --> 00:45:43.258
Please, just let me know
you're all right.


497
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.924
Just call, okay?

498
00:45:48.189 --> 00:45:49.566
I love you.

499
00:45:57.098 --> 00:45:59.510
Who taught you how to play pool?

500
00:45:59.834 --> 00:46:01.211
All right?

501
00:46:01.336 --> 00:46:03.907
Watch and learn, watch and learn.

502
00:46:04.372 --> 00:46:05.510
Mr. Hench.

503
00:46:06.875 --> 00:46:08.143
- Hey, Buds.
- Hey.


504
00:46:08.243 --> 00:46:09.950
- Here.
- Thanks.


505
00:46:11.779 --> 00:46:14.316
I'm having lunch with Mario Garza.

506
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.694
Tuesday morning at the Hotel Esperano.

507
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.996
You're having lunch? 
Lunch with Garza?

508
00:46:22.423 --> 00:46:25.836
I used to edit an NYU journal.
A friend of mine handles it now.


509
00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.729
He writes to Garza,

510
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:31.572
requests an interview with a correspondent
who just happens to be in the area.


511
00:46:38.139 --> 00:46:40.779
And what makes you think
he fell for that?


512
00:46:41.209 --> 00:46:43.485
Well, New York University,

513
00:46:44.312 --> 00:46:46.014
bright young students

514
00:46:46.114 --> 00:46:50.028
seeking his opinion on border issues,
making him feel important.


515
00:46:50.785 --> 00:46:52.560
It's hard to resist.

516
00:46:57.725 --> 00:46:59.068
Education.

517
00:47:30.792 --> 00:47:34.329
We got a new one going over.
I need you to lead a prayer for him, Father.


518
00:47:34.429 --> 00:47:36.331
I've heard a lot about you
from Father Sanchez.


519
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:37.565
You heard what?

520
00:47:37.665 --> 00:47:40.373
That your wife was very kind
to this chapel.


521
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.120
Jakey, shut the doors.

522
00:48:13.301 --> 00:48:14.507
Dear Lord.

523
00:48:17.238 --> 00:48:19.741
My brother worries for me very much.

524
00:48:22.543 --> 00:48:24.716
Please, make him understand

525
00:48:25.513 --> 00:48:27.925
how carefully I've thought this through.

526
00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.730
And that everything is going
to be okay in Mexico.


527
00:48:33.488 --> 00:48:35.729
And soon, he'll be at my wedding,

528
00:48:36.124 --> 00:48:40.004
in his tux, giving his speech,

529
00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:44.310
which I'm dying to hear.

530
00:49:57.472 --> 00:49:58.746
I'm sorry.

531
00:50:24.265 --> 00:50:28.569
So, Mr. Garza, you deny
you're the top gun-runner in Mexico?


532
00:50:28.669 --> 00:50:31.741
I am a thinker. Not a thug.

533
00:50:31.973 --> 00:50:33.418
Look around.

534
00:50:34.475 --> 00:50:36.580
Do you see any goons in my hotel?

535
00:50:38.112 --> 00:50:41.116
You consider yourself a social worker.

536
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:43.187
Welcome to Esperano.

537
00:50:44.652 --> 00:50:46.393
I build schools.

538
00:50:47.455 --> 00:50:49.093
I build hospitals.

539
00:50:50.124 --> 00:50:52.104
I build roads.

540
00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:56.000
Now and then, I even build churches.

541
00:50:56.998 --> 00:51:00.309
Well, they say you've ordered

542
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:05.746
I ordered an orange juice

543
00:51:06.174 --> 00:51:08.848
If I had that kind of power,
you tell me,


544
00:51:09.343 --> 00:51:11.755
where is my juice?

545
00:51:12.813 --> 00:51:14.759
Pablo, my order.

546
00:51:15.449 --> 00:51:16.655
Find my juice.

547
00:51:16.784 --> 00:51:18.354
I'm dying here.

548
00:51:20.721 --> 00:51:22.496
Mr. Jacobs,

549
00:51:23.691 --> 00:51:26.695
I provide schoolbooks for poor children,

550
00:51:27.261 --> 00:51:30.470
medicine for those who cannot afford it.

551
00:51:30.998 --> 00:51:33.911
I sponsor orchestras for troubled youth.

552
00:51:34.268 --> 00:51:37.613
People come to me
when they are in need.

553
00:51:38.172 --> 00:51:39.242
Why?

554
00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.714
Because the Mexican government
has let them down.


555
00:51:43.444 --> 00:51:46.254
So, the rumors are true.
You are running for election?


556
00:51:47.381 --> 00:51:48.553
You tell me.

557
00:51:48.849 --> 00:51:49.987
Should I?

558
00:51:54.822 --> 00:51:57.496
Well, if you're thinking of running,
why do you...


559
00:51:57.758 --> 00:52:00.094
Why do you lead a life like this?

560
00:52:00.194 --> 00:52:01.571
Like what?

561
00:52:02.096 --> 00:52:04.465
They say you sleep
in a different bed every night.


562
00:52:04.565 --> 00:52:06.067
Why would they say that?

563
00:52:08.636 --> 00:52:10.047
Why?

564
00:52:15.743 --> 00:52:18.349
Because when they know where I sleep,

565
00:52:18.479 --> 00:52:20.459
they dress like fucking tourists

566
00:52:20.848 --> 00:52:22.450
and come to kill me.

567
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:23.790
Sir, I have no idea...

568
00:52:23.918 --> 00:52:27.121
Hench has a rat
in that shitty old theater of his.


569
00:52:27.221 --> 00:52:29.824
I know who you are, you little fuck!

570
00:53:09.797 --> 00:53:11.071
Pablo!

571
00:53:11.198 --> 00:53:13.439
My orange juice.

572
00:53:14.568 --> 00:53:16.912
You saved my life.

573
00:53:27.148 --> 00:53:28.650
Julius Hench,

574
00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.256
I am sending you your family pictures.

575
00:53:33.554 --> 00:53:37.525
Next time, I will put your fucking face

576
00:53:37.925 --> 00:53:40.098
on those pictures.

577
00:53:42.263 --> 00:53:43.571
Show him.

578
00:53:50.237 --> 00:53:53.411
I am sending you your family pictures.

579
00:53:54.075 --> 00:53:58.479
Next time, I will put your fucking face

580
00:53:58.579 --> 00:54:00.217
on those pictures.

581
00:54:05.953 --> 00:54:07.523
It was a trap.

582
00:54:08.456 --> 00:54:10.493
They knew we were coming.

583
00:54:15.429 --> 00:54:18.672
You look like shit. 
Get some rest.

584
00:54:20.835 --> 00:54:22.336
Buddy, take him.

585
00:54:22.436 --> 00:54:24.780
Yeah. Come on. Come on, Jakey.

586
00:54:27.141 --> 00:54:29.644
Are you all right? 
You all right?

587
00:54:30.945 --> 00:54:31.946
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.


588
00:54:32.046 --> 00:54:34.181
It was a good plan.
How'd it go so wrong?


589
00:54:34.281 --> 00:54:36.625
Hey, Franco, are you talking
about Jakey?


590
00:54:37.051 --> 00:54:39.687
My brother?
You know he's my brother, right?


591
00:54:39.787 --> 00:54:41.255
Okay, he went across the fence.

592
00:54:41.355 --> 00:54:43.224
He went and I should've gone!

593
00:54:43.324 --> 00:54:45.293
We know that. We know.

594
00:54:45.393 --> 00:54:47.628
He's a good man! Okay? 
He's a good man!

595
00:54:47.728 --> 00:54:50.031
We know that he's a good man!
We know it!


596
00:54:50.131 --> 00:54:51.508
All right? Hey!

597
00:54:52.199 --> 00:54:55.305
The Lord answered our prayers, didn't he?
He's alive, right?


598
00:54:57.238 --> 00:54:58.683
Where is he?

599
00:54:59.707 --> 00:55:01.482
Where's he at? 
He's right there.

600
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:03.611
He's right there.

601
00:55:03.711 --> 00:55:06.282
He's alive, son, safe and sound.

602
00:55:07.648 --> 00:55:11.596
Calm yourself down.
Take care of your brother.


603
00:55:13.187 --> 00:55:14.291
Okay.

604
00:55:14.555 --> 00:55:16.831
All right then, take him home.

605
00:55:17.591 --> 00:55:18.763
Okay.

606
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.284
Go ahead, Franco. 
What were you saying?

607
00:56:19.753 --> 00:56:20.921
Hello?

608
00:56:21.021 --> 00:56:24.191
Mr. Garza? Julius Hench heard the tape.

609
00:56:24.291 --> 00:56:26.396
No names, you fool.

610
00:56:27.862 --> 00:56:30.531
Why'd you call so late?

611
00:56:30.631 --> 00:56:34.408
Well, I think
that Franco's getting suspicious.


612
00:56:35.135 --> 00:56:37.304
I just wanted to...

613
00:56:37.404 --> 00:56:39.543
I'll call you back tomorrow.

614
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:47.449
Hench has a rat
in that shitty old theater...


615
00:56:54.421 --> 00:56:57.925
Hench has a rat
in that shitty old theater of his.


616
00:57:00.995 --> 00:57:02.565
It's McBradden.

617
00:57:09.303 --> 00:57:10.941
James?

618
00:57:11.672 --> 00:57:15.976
I thought you should know. Last night,
a call was made to Mario Garza.


619
00:57:16.076 --> 00:57:17.111
From where?

620
00:57:17.211 --> 00:57:19.885
The cell tower near you. Real close.

621
00:57:20.548 --> 00:57:22.926
Real fuckin' close.

622
00:57:24.018 --> 00:57:26.555
Do you have a name for me?

623
00:57:27.288 --> 00:57:31.794
No, I do not.
But Garza's gonna call him in five.


624
00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.533
That's your rat.

625
00:57:51.211 --> 00:57:52.246
Franco!

626
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:56.086
Get everybody in the hall.

627
00:57:59.453 --> 00:58:02.024
Buddy, shut the doors.

628
00:58:10.197 --> 00:58:14.942
I want all you men
to put your guns in this bucket.


629
00:58:17.204 --> 00:58:18.274
Let's go!

630
00:58:25.946 --> 00:58:27.550
That's you, too, Buddy.

631
00:58:28.449 --> 00:58:29.951
Come on, son.

632
00:58:43.597 --> 00:58:46.134
Ace, you know what a rat looks like?

633
00:58:46.867 --> 00:58:48.175
Yes, sir.

634
00:58:50.471 --> 00:58:54.146
You think most people would know a rat
if they saw one?


635
00:58:55.709 --> 00:58:57.017
Yes, sir.

636
00:59:00.948 --> 00:59:02.825
Well, that's strange.

637
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:07.521
'Cause it seems like a rat
has gone unnoticed in our theater.


638
00:59:07.621 --> 00:59:10.295
And this rat, he set us up.

639
00:59:12.126 --> 00:59:13.935
Killed our brothers.

640
00:59:16.463 --> 00:59:20.468
Any minute now, his phone is gonna ring.

641
00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:26.408
And I'm gonna know who that rat is.

642
00:59:30.377 --> 00:59:33.017
And then I'm gonna take these bullets,

643
00:59:33.781 --> 00:59:36.421
and I'm gonna put 'em
in his fucking skull.


644
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:45.661
Sound fair to you, Buddy?

645
00:59:49.963 --> 00:59:51.135
Yeah.

646
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.372
Yeah.

647
00:59:58.305 --> 01:00:03.152
That's so our conscience is clear,
college boy.


648
01:00:05.112 --> 01:00:06.750
We'll just wait.

649
01:00:56.063 --> 01:00:58.236
You put your speakerphone on!

650
01:01:01.602 --> 01:01:02.636
No, it's bullshit!

651
01:01:02.736 --> 01:01:04.272
It's bullshit! It's a lie!

652
01:02:32.259 --> 01:02:34.000
I said fuck Garza!

653
01:02:34.828 --> 01:02:36.398
You understand?

654
01:02:46.106 --> 01:02:47.642
Garza called.

655
01:02:48.475 --> 01:02:51.285
- So, he knows.
- Yeah.


656
01:02:52.713 --> 01:02:55.549
- He scared?
- Shit-scared.


657
01:02:55.649 --> 01:02:59.753
Every gang that's ever bought a gun from
you in Mexico is going after him tonight.


658
01:03:05.926 --> 01:03:07.803
That's a lot of guns.

659
01:03:08.595 --> 01:03:10.302
He wants to meet.

660
01:03:11.064 --> 01:03:13.534
- When?
- Tonight at 8:00.


661
01:03:13.634 --> 01:03:15.079
All right. Well...

662
01:03:16.169 --> 01:03:17.137
Set it up.

663
01:03:17.237 --> 01:03:18.511
I have.

664
01:03:20.307 --> 01:03:24.687
And, boss?
Garza says to leave Buddy at home.


665
01:04:06.687 --> 01:04:08.689
I thought you were dead.

666
01:04:11.858 --> 01:04:14.099
Why didn't you answer my calls?

667
01:04:14.661 --> 01:04:16.470
- What's going on?
- Victoria?


668
01:04:19.566 --> 01:04:20.738
Victoria?

669
01:04:22.536 --> 01:04:23.879
Vittoria.

670
01:04:26.406 --> 01:04:28.181
Can I call you Vee?

671
01:04:29.142 --> 01:04:31.486
It's so nice to meet you, Buddy.

672
01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:43.835
You speak Italian?

673
01:04:44.024 --> 01:04:46.834
No. Eric taught me.

674
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.902
You are so pretty.

675
01:04:58.171 --> 01:05:02.620
Welcome home, Vee.
I'm really glad you came.


676
01:05:06.113 --> 01:05:08.218
Come on in. I'll get you...

677
01:05:18.325 --> 01:05:20.703
Our home

678
01:05:22.796 --> 01:05:24.571
is a little messy.

679
01:05:25.699 --> 01:05:27.110
It's fine.

680
01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:31.838
Vee.

681
01:05:31.938 --> 01:05:36.543
Vee, I got a surprise for you. Okay?
We're gonna go take a little drive. Okay?


682
01:05:36.643 --> 01:05:39.954
I wanna take you somewhere. Come on.
Grab my jacket. Come on.


683
01:06:04.504 --> 01:06:06.108
Welcome to your new home.

684
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.514
My home?

685
01:06:10.777 --> 01:06:14.848
I'm sorry. You know, when I built it,

686
01:06:14.948 --> 01:06:16.552
I didn't know your name.

687
01:06:18.718 --> 01:06:21.388
I'll cut a new sign tomorrow.

688
01:06:21.488 --> 01:06:22.626
Yeah.

689
01:06:25.092 --> 01:06:26.662
The thing is

690
01:06:27.994 --> 01:06:29.496
I kind of...

691
01:06:30.063 --> 01:06:32.202
I kind of don't know
how to spell your name.


692
01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:37.244
It's a hard name to spell, Buddy.
Most people can't.


693
01:06:38.738 --> 01:06:40.513
Let me write it down for you.

694
01:07:07.234 --> 01:07:09.180
Yeah, I really like you, Vee.

695
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:13.875
You know what? 
You should be the first.

696
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:15.176
The first?

697
01:07:15.742 --> 01:07:17.551
Yeah, the first to ride Jakey's horse.

698
01:07:19.146 --> 01:07:20.814
I would love to, Buddy.

699
01:07:20.914 --> 01:07:23.258
Do you think I could
talk to your brother for a second?


700
01:07:24.017 --> 01:07:25.519
Yeah, sure.

701
01:07:25.619 --> 01:07:27.963
Why don't you show her inside?
Show her your room.


702
01:07:28.255 --> 01:07:29.734
All right. Let's...

703
01:07:32.259 --> 01:07:34.428
You know, you must be really hungry.

704
01:07:34.528 --> 01:07:36.897
I'll make you baked trout.
I'll make Mama's recipe.


705
01:07:36.997 --> 01:07:38.408
Thank you.

706
01:07:49.509 --> 01:07:51.045
Now, tell me.

707
01:07:52.312 --> 01:07:54.417
What's the problem, Jacob?

708
01:07:57.217 --> 01:07:59.424
My love, look at me.

709
01:08:00.253 --> 01:08:04.191
Whatever it is,
it can't be worse than my imagination.


710
01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:07.494
I'm thinking of 10,000
terrible things right now,


711
01:08:07.594 --> 01:08:09.198
so, just tell me.

712
01:08:11.498 --> 01:08:13.307
I want you to leave.

713
01:08:17.237 --> 01:08:18.572
I just want you to leave.

714
01:08:18.672 --> 01:08:20.413
I'm going nowhere.

715
01:08:25.512 --> 01:08:27.788
So, just tell me everything.

716
01:08:34.854 --> 01:08:35.958
I...

717
01:08:37.657 --> 01:08:39.102
Yeah, baby?

718
01:08:44.464 --> 01:08:46.034
I killed a man.

719
01:09:30.477 --> 01:09:32.923
Now, let me tell
you a story about Vee.

720
01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:37.390
I really like Vee.

721
01:09:40.787 --> 01:09:43.859
I liked her the very second
she spelled her name for me.


722
01:10:40.313 --> 01:10:44.819
And when she and my brother Jakey
leave the church as a married couple,


723
01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:50.294
I'll go bananas.

724
01:10:52.892 --> 01:10:54.200
Bananas.

725
01:10:58.198 --> 01:11:00.075
And that's all I have to say.

726
01:11:09.075 --> 01:11:10.418
Hey, dinner's ready!

727
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.590
I'm not gonna go without Buddy.

728
01:11:19.185 --> 01:11:20.755
He won't leave.

729
01:11:21.287 --> 01:11:23.062
I'll talk to Buddy.

730
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:26.266
It'll all work out, I promise.

731
01:11:28.294 --> 01:11:30.467
There is always another way.

732
01:11:34.834 --> 01:11:36.745
Don't take long!

733
01:11:41.608 --> 01:11:42.976
No! Gotta get it in the glass!

734
01:11:43.076 --> 01:11:44.110
Here, gimme your glass.
Gimme your glass.


735
01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:45.621
I'll do you first. Good.

736
01:11:46.513 --> 01:11:47.685
Tell me when.

737
01:11:47.947 --> 01:11:49.722
That's it? Okay. All right. Now you.

738
01:11:49.983 --> 01:11:52.725
- No, no, you go.
- No, no, come on, come on.


739
01:11:56.723 --> 01:11:59.169
Remember Mama's china?

740
01:11:59.926 --> 01:12:01.961
All this, it's so special.

741
01:12:02.061 --> 01:12:04.974
Yeah. Yeah.

742
01:12:05.732 --> 01:12:07.405
Here, gimme that.

743
01:12:07.767 --> 01:12:10.213
Buddy, are you coming to our wedding?

744
01:12:11.237 --> 01:12:12.875
Yeah, of course.

745
01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.211
I got a speech almost done.

746
01:12:17.777 --> 01:12:20.485
It's five minutes, 47 seconds.

747
01:12:22.649 --> 01:12:24.492
I spoke from the heart.

748
01:12:26.319 --> 01:12:28.121
Here.

749
01:12:28.221 --> 01:12:32.226
We've decided to get married in Verona.
My hometown in Italy.


750
01:12:32.892 --> 01:12:35.395
It's quite far. 
Will you still come?

751
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:38.903
Yeah, of course. Sure, Vee.

752
01:12:39.365 --> 01:12:40.776
Some trout, my love?

753
01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:42.802
Yeah, yeah, please.

754
01:12:42.902 --> 01:12:44.108
Jakey.

755
01:12:45.171 --> 01:12:47.117
But it will be our secret.

756
01:12:47.574 --> 01:12:49.850
We just go, get married,

757
01:12:50.176 --> 01:12:52.779
and it will be a big surprise
for our friends.


758
01:12:52.879 --> 01:12:56.554
Yeah. Yeah, they will be very surprised.

759
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:58.418
But no telling anyone.

760
01:12:58.518 --> 01:13:00.589
Absolutely anyone, okay?

761
01:13:01.821 --> 01:13:05.268
Okay. Yeah, cross my heart.

762
01:13:06.092 --> 01:13:07.537
Okay. I cross my heart.

763
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:10.469
Try it.

764
01:13:13.166 --> 01:13:15.237
Verona. So, when do we go?

765
01:13:18.605 --> 01:13:21.176
We were thinking we'd go tonight.

766
01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:26.613
Mama's recipe is delicious.

767
01:13:26.713 --> 01:13:27.885
Yeah?

768
01:13:32.151 --> 01:13:34.961
Well, I can't go tonight.

769
01:13:37.991 --> 01:13:40.028
I can't leave Julius now.

770
01:13:42.695 --> 01:13:44.402
I got a job to do.

771
01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:46.936
Yeah.

772
01:13:49.235 --> 01:13:50.441
Garza.

773
01:13:55.074 --> 01:13:56.610
You know that.

774
01:13:57.477 --> 01:13:59.047
What's a job for, Buddy?

775
01:14:00.713 --> 01:14:02.090
What?

776
01:14:02.949 --> 01:14:04.792
It's for the family.

777
01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.429
Hand me your wallet.

778
01:14:10.223 --> 01:14:12.032
Just give it to me.

779
01:14:20.033 --> 01:14:21.603
Remember this?

780
01:14:22.635 --> 01:14:24.137
Jakey's share.

781
01:14:26.873 --> 01:14:28.648
From your first job.

782
01:14:47.026 --> 01:14:48.437
He kept it?

783
01:14:50.396 --> 01:14:51.534
Yeah, Dubby.

784
01:14:52.632 --> 01:14:54.270
I'm sorry, "Dubby"?

785
01:14:55.568 --> 01:14:57.172
That's what you wrote.

786
01:14:57.937 --> 01:14:59.848
See?

787
01:15:05.712 --> 01:15:06.850
Yeah.

788
01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:13.724
'B's and 'D's, they used to confuse me.

789
01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.729
I know. I mix
them up all the time.

790
01:15:18.057 --> 01:15:19.229
Yeah?

791
01:15:23.363 --> 01:15:24.808
You kept it?

792
01:15:27.367 --> 01:15:28.903
All these years?

793
01:15:31.604 --> 01:15:33.049
Yeah, Buds.

794
01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:36.679
Yeah?

795
01:15:39.779 --> 01:15:43.727
Why? Why? It's just six bucks.

796
01:15:44.417 --> 01:15:47.754
It means more to him
than anything in the world.


797
01:15:47.854 --> 01:15:51.961
Because when you got your first paycheck,
you thought of your little brother.


798
01:15:52.959 --> 01:15:55.735
Your brother needs you
to be his best man.


799
01:15:56.596 --> 01:15:59.440
You think this dummy will marry me
without your wedding speech?


800
01:16:14.947 --> 01:16:16.290
Hey, Vee.

801
01:16:19.619 --> 01:16:20.825
Are...

802
01:16:21.954 --> 01:16:24.161
Are there any movie theaters in Verona?

803
01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:28.198
- Yes, Buddy.
- Yeah?


804
01:16:28.628 --> 01:16:29.663
Seven.

805
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:32.910
Seven? That's a lot.

806
01:16:41.374 --> 01:16:44.446
Well, I need to go get my tuxedo.

807
01:16:45.311 --> 01:16:48.451
I can't leave without my tux. Okay?

808
01:16:49.782 --> 01:16:53.924
All right, you guys eat. Okay?
Just save that for me. I'll be right back.


809
01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.421
All right?

810
01:17:03.463 --> 01:17:05.238
I'll be right back!

811
01:17:39.766 --> 01:17:42.301
I hear we're going to war.

812
01:17:42.401 --> 01:17:44.745
Is Franco calling you from hell?

813
01:17:45.705 --> 01:17:47.480
Franco wasn't my man.

814
01:17:48.808 --> 01:17:50.412
Well, then, who?

815
01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:52.945
What will the answer get me?

816
01:17:53.045 --> 01:17:56.822
My word, no war. 
Just tell me who it is.

817
01:17:57.984 --> 01:17:59.725
He's the man who killed Eric.

818
01:18:00.419 --> 01:18:03.366
No, that was your man.
McBradden told me that.


819
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:08.102
My man, from your side of the fence.

820
01:18:09.428 --> 01:18:11.965
Just tell me the fuckin' name!

821
01:18:12.431 --> 01:18:16.902
I am sorry, Mr. Hench.
I gave him my word.


822
01:18:17.136 --> 01:18:19.412
I promised the young reporter

823
01:18:20.173 --> 01:18:23.484
I would not utter his name.

824
01:18:29.048 --> 01:18:31.187
The fucking vegetarian!

825
01:19:06.886 --> 01:19:08.832
Carry me over the threshold.

826
01:19:29.275 --> 01:19:30.618
Good boy.

827
01:20:08.047 --> 01:20:10.027
Where's college boy at?

828
01:20:12.952 --> 01:20:16.832
Why, it's a secret, Julius.
It's a surprise.


829
01:20:18.891 --> 01:20:23.499
Well, I got a
secret for you, too, Bud.

830
01:20:26.699 --> 01:20:30.738
You see, Garza didn't kill Eric.

831
01:20:32.705 --> 01:20:34.480
But I know who did.

832
01:20:35.174 --> 01:20:36.710
Open that up.

833
01:20:43.015 --> 01:20:44.722
Who is it, Julius?

834
01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:48.694
Tell me.

835
01:20:50.523 --> 01:20:52.799
I'll put a bullet in his head.

836
01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.262
I'll kill him.

837
01:20:57.330 --> 01:20:59.401
And then I'll wake him up.

838
01:21:00.499 --> 01:21:03.173
And I'll kill him again.

839
01:21:18.384 --> 01:21:22.188
Jacob wasn't playing
checkers with you that night.


840
01:21:22.288 --> 01:21:23.733
Was he, Bud?

841
01:21:30.096 --> 01:21:31.200
No.

842
01:21:32.231 --> 01:21:33.335
No.

843
01:21:37.136 --> 01:21:41.744
No, hey. Hey, hey.
It wasn't Jake's fault. He...


844
01:21:42.775 --> 01:21:45.415
Poor Jake, he got sick. You know?

845
01:21:46.112 --> 01:21:49.093
Hey, hey. Light me a cigar.

846
01:21:56.088 --> 01:21:58.364
Light me one of those up, son.

847
01:22:09.869 --> 01:22:11.746
Your first horse.

848
01:22:14.206 --> 01:22:15.549
Remember?

849
01:22:17.043 --> 01:22:18.750
We went to Marsha's ranch.

850
01:22:19.645 --> 01:22:22.182
What color was that foal you picked?

851
01:22:30.823 --> 01:22:32.029
It was white.

852
01:22:32.892 --> 01:22:34.064
Right.

853
01:22:36.529 --> 01:22:37.872
For Jake.

854
01:22:39.732 --> 01:22:42.440
Jake never came. Never.

855
01:22:45.538 --> 01:22:48.883
While you waited,
what did we do with that young stallion?


856
01:22:52.478 --> 01:22:54.014
We broke him.

857
01:22:54.246 --> 01:22:55.953
Yes, we broke him.

858
01:23:00.853 --> 01:23:02.196
Sit down!

859
01:23:03.556 --> 01:23:06.926
We got him a saddle.
A gorgeous one, tanned leather.


860
01:23:07.026 --> 01:23:10.337
- Red. Remember that?
- Yeah.


861
01:23:15.801 --> 01:23:18.179
Then what happened to that horse?

862
01:23:20.539 --> 01:23:22.018
A fox bit him.

863
01:23:22.942 --> 01:23:24.478
He got rabies.

864
01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:30.160
That's right, he started kicking and biting,
and that broken horse went crazy.


865
01:23:30.416 --> 01:23:34.592
He could've killed us, son.
What did Pop tell you to do?


866
01:23:36.122 --> 01:23:38.898
That we had to put him to sleep.

867
01:23:39.158 --> 01:23:41.365
And who had to do it?

868
01:23:42.428 --> 01:23:44.066
Me.

869
01:23:44.396 --> 01:23:47.502
Because I loved him the most.

870
01:23:47.633 --> 01:23:52.139
Anyone else, it would've been
too goddamn painful for that horse.


871
01:23:53.806 --> 01:23:56.446
He didn't see that gun in your hand,
your finger on that trigger.


872
01:23:56.675 --> 01:23:59.311
All he saw was your eyes,

873
01:23:59.411 --> 01:24:04.087
your caring, loving eyes,
putting him to sleep.


874
01:24:06.886 --> 01:24:10.561
The last thing that horse felt, Bud.

875
01:24:11.857 --> 01:24:13.200
Your love.

876
01:24:17.997 --> 01:24:20.136
'Cause the horse wasn't bad.

877
01:24:21.967 --> 01:24:23.412
He was just sick.

878
01:24:24.103 --> 01:24:25.241
Yes.

879
01:24:29.108 --> 01:24:31.179
That's what happened with Jake.

880
01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:37.149
The city bit him like a fox. He went mad,
he went insane. He killed Eric.


881
01:24:37.249 --> 01:24:41.425
He made a deal
with Garza to kill me.

882
01:24:43.756 --> 01:24:45.292
Hey, hey, hey.

883
01:24:46.025 --> 01:24:48.164
Hey, no, it ain't his fault.

884
01:24:49.328 --> 01:24:51.934
You see, he got sick.

885
01:24:52.631 --> 01:24:54.577
He just got sick, is all.

886
01:25:06.312 --> 01:25:08.883
You've got to put him to sleep.

887
01:25:10.082 --> 01:25:11.618
At his ranch.

888
01:25:12.985 --> 01:25:15.693
You can visit him there every day.

889
01:25:17.690 --> 01:25:19.931
He will never leave you again.

890
01:25:20.793 --> 01:25:21.999
Never.

891
01:25:25.431 --> 01:25:27.638
This is your final test.

892
01:25:31.203 --> 01:25:33.046
You pass this test,

893
01:25:35.207 --> 01:25:36.811
you will have earned it.

894
01:25:41.513 --> 01:25:42.685
Let's see it.

895
01:25:59.665 --> 01:26:01.110
Look at you.

896
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.874
My son.

897
01:26:06.939 --> 01:26:08.350
Come here.

898
01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.284
William Heckum.

899
01:26:18.651 --> 01:26:21.325
The brave son of a proud father

900
01:26:24.556 --> 01:26:26.900
who will put Jake to sleep,

901
01:26:27.593 --> 01:26:29.539
'cause he loves him the most.

902
01:26:32.031 --> 01:26:33.840
You understand, son?

903
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:37.339
Yeah.

904
01:26:39.204 --> 01:26:40.979
I understand.

905
01:28:36.388 --> 01:28:39.028
Pop said, "Jakey,

906
01:28:39.858 --> 01:28:42.628
"you came into this world after Buddy.

907
01:28:42.728 --> 01:28:46.505
"But he doesn't understand what he's doing,
so you gotta be the big brother."


908
01:28:47.599 --> 01:28:51.012
The next day,
Jakey let me win at checkers


909
01:28:51.203 --> 01:28:53.183
and never beat me again.

910
01:28:54.373 --> 01:28:58.377
And once, you know, when kids at school
called me a slowpoke behind my back,


911
01:28:58.477 --> 01:29:00.047
Jakey got into a fight with them.

912
01:29:00.212 --> 01:29:02.249
He got beat up pretty bad.

913
01:29:03.348 --> 01:29:07.296
But when Mama asked him who done it,
Jakey wouldn't tell.


914
01:29:08.754 --> 01:29:10.789
Pop said, "You know, Jakey's right
to keep it a secret.


915
01:29:10.889 --> 01:29:13.559
"If Buddy found out,
he'd put those boys in the hospital.


916
01:29:13.659 --> 01:29:16.401
"Buddy'd go nuts if anybody hurt Jakey."

917
01:29:18.063 --> 01:29:22.011
And then he told Mama,
"My heart's at peace today.


918
01:29:22.901 --> 01:29:25.938
"'Cause I know when you
and I are no longer on this Earth,


919
01:29:26.038 --> 01:29:28.211
"our boys are gonna
look after each other."


920
01:29:30.776 --> 01:29:32.050
Buds?

921
01:30:13.151 --> 01:30:15.563
Don't splash. Okay? Don't splash.

922
01:30:15.787 --> 01:30:16.822
Aren't you coming, Buds?

923
01:30:16.922 --> 01:30:18.824
Yeah, I'm coming.
I gotta talk to Julius first.


924
01:30:18.924 --> 01:30:19.958
I'm not gonna go without you.

925
01:30:20.058 --> 01:30:21.503
You gotta go, Jakey.

926
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:23.037
You gotta take care of Vee.

927
01:30:23.562 --> 01:30:26.236
I'm coming, I promise.
I'll be there at your wedding.


928
01:30:44.082 --> 01:30:46.119
What's the grin for, Bud?

929
01:30:49.955 --> 01:30:51.628
I saved the fish.

930
01:30:52.791 --> 01:30:54.293
It swam away.

931
01:30:57.829 --> 01:30:59.365
Jacob's gone.

932
01:31:07.839 --> 01:31:09.409
My pop said

933
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:13.888
that I'll look after my brother.

934
01:31:15.314 --> 01:31:17.385
Never let anyone hurt him.

935
01:31:22.955 --> 01:31:25.265
Put your hands above your head.

936
01:31:36.969 --> 01:31:39.074
I have to go back for my brother.

937
01:31:44.543 --> 01:31:47.319
We'll find Jake
before the night is over.


938
01:31:48.814 --> 01:31:51.693
And I'll lay him to rest
right next to you.


939
01:31:55.988 --> 01:31:58.093
You'll be together forever.

940
01:32:01.727 --> 01:32:03.764
Just like my wife and son.

941
01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:08.437
Every Sunday I'll put flowers on you.

942
01:32:09.735 --> 01:32:13.046
Red flowers, white flowers.

943
01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.513
It'll be perfect.

944
01:32:19.444 --> 01:32:23.893
But right now,
I've got to put you to sleep myself.


945
01:32:25.817 --> 01:32:27.922
Because I love you the most.

946
01:32:30.122 --> 01:32:32.068
You understand me, son?

947
01:32:36.828 --> 01:32:39.104
Yeah, I understand.

948
01:32:40.165 --> 01:32:42.509
I am not your son.

949
01:32:43.101 --> 01:32:45.206
You are not my pop.

950
01:32:46.038 --> 01:32:47.540
You are a bad man.

951
01:33:51.269 --> 01:33:54.341
Now, let me tell
you a story about Vee.

952
01:33:55.307 --> 01:33:57.014
I really like Vee.

953
01:33:58.744 --> 01:34:02.191
I liked her the very second
she spelled her name for me.


954
01:34:03.014 --> 01:34:05.290
I decided right there and then

955
01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:08.597
that I'm gonna
be the best man in her wedding.


956
01:34:10.188 --> 01:34:14.466
And when she and Jakey kiss each other,
I'll clap the loudest.


957
01:34:18.029 --> 01:34:20.198
And as she gets down the altar,

958
01:34:20.298 --> 01:34:22.403
I'll throw flowers on her.

959
01:34:25.871 --> 01:34:30.411
And when she and my brother Jakey
leave the church as a married couple,


960
01:34:32.277 --> 01:34:33.915
I'll go bananas.

961
01:34:39.918 --> 01:34:41.158
Bananas.

962
01:34:44.956 --> 01:34:46.936
And that's all I have to say.
