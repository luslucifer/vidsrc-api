1
00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:21.783
( Woman #1) To lose
an 18-year-old brother.


2
00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:25.082
He didn't get a chance to graduate
from high school. It was a blow.


3
00:00:25.154 --> 00:00:28.351
It destroyed me.
It made me feel like--


4
00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:30.790
I was afraid
to love anybody.


5
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.160
I was really afraid
to let people get close to me.


6
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:38.359
I felt
if I loved somebody,


7
00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:41.096
deeply, you know,
like I do my family,


8
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.536
they would be taken away.

9
00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:27.749
( Man ) I said, "Where'd you learn
to do that?"


10
00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:30.513
She said, "Practicing on
an old flame since I was 16."


11
00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:32.713
( Audience Laughs )

12
00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.522
Look at this guy here. He's lookin' at
me and beatin' his meat. I like that.


13
00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:42.189
There she is. Right?
Miss America, 1912.


14
00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:45.098
lna!
Let's hear it for lna.


15
00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:47.227
Comes here every night,
huh, sweetie?


16
00:01:47.303 --> 00:01:49.931
Right.
Let me have a kiss.


17
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.702
- ( Man ) Bring out the broads!
- ( Audience Cheers )


18
00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:54.709
Let me at him!
Let me at him!


19
00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:56.768
Somebody throw a net
over this broad.


20
00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:58.746
Did you see him kiss
that fat fucker?


21
00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:00.908
( Woman #2 ) Steve.
I'll always know him as 18.


22
00:02:00.983 --> 00:02:02.746
He, uh--

23
00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.950
He was killed by a drunk driver just
a month before he was to graduate.


24
00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:09.958
And--

25
00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:13.018
( Woman #3 ) It's hard when you have
two policemen come in and say,


26
00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:15.359
"Your daughter's dead."

27
00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:18.798
I op-- I opened the door
and I saw 'em standing there,


28
00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:21.302
and I said,
"Mandy's dead, isn't she?"


29
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.270
A mom knows.

30
00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:42.686
- ( Men Cheer )
- All right!


31
00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:45.750
Freddy, he's comin' over here.
You better slide in... a lot.


32
00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:49.127
- He needs half a booth.
- Sunny. How ya doin', Sunny?
Everything good?


33
00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:51.098
( Men Laugh )

34
00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:53.101
How 'bout that?
How'd you like to spank it?


35
00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.729
- Nice!
- Oh, yeah! But softly.


36
00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:58.797
- Sunny, you had to spank that, right?
- Nice.


37
00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:01.571
My wife,
you know Joan.


38
00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:05.273
We got a step-down living room.
It's like two steps down.


39
00:03:05.348 --> 00:03:07.976
So the bitch don't wanna walk.
She wants me to raise it.


40
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.280
She don't wanna walk down
two steps.


41
00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:12.981
I still have to get over that.
It's something that...


42
00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:17.048
-you have to work with on a daily basis.
-it's not gonna come back.


43
00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:21.586
It's just something of-- It's yours.
It's like your body lost...


44
00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:24.394
something inside,
something of yourself.


45
00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:27.163
I miss me.

46
00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:30.672
I miss... me.

47
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.834
It's over five years now,
and...


48
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.370
I look in the mirror,
"Where's Bobby?"


49
00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.005
I don't know.

50
00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:43.347
My family drives me
up the fuckin' wall.


51
00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.083
I mean, they, I guess they still,
they still think I'm me, Bobby.


52
00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:52.560
But... they joke about it.

53
00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:57.531
They call me...
sibling number three, all right?


54
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.628
And... it's like a nickname
for Bobby depressed.


55
00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:05.265
It was my older brother Danny
that we lost.


56
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:10.244
And...

57
00:04:10.313 --> 00:04:14.181
he was sibling number one.

58
00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:17.185
And...

59
00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:21.621
they, th-they didn't--

60
00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:24.251
Did they forget?
I don't know.


61
00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:28.921
I'm gone!

62
00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:30.932
( Chuckles )
And--


63
00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:34.927
I miss me.

64
00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:39.968
So...

65
00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:42.806
that's it.

66
00:04:46.248 --> 00:04:49.740

71
00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:30.351
- You should go.
- Okay, yeah. I'm gonna go.


72
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.120
Um... Freddy,
can I use your shower?


73
00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:38.189
Help yourself.

# There was a

It's five after 10:00. I got a window
display of gray feIt. What's goin' on?


97
00:09:20.823 --> 00:09:23.758
Mr. Gale, you took all the vauIt keys
home last night.


98
00:09:23.826 --> 00:09:27.284
- For fuck sakes.
- I think...


99
00:09:27.363 --> 00:09:30.025
it would be wonderful to put emerald
pieces in front of the diamonds.


100

I trust your preference
in stones, Jefferey, but...

I'm very busy,

a little bit.

00:16:25.013 --> 00:16:26.981
Well, well, well.

157
00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:36.115
- Um, you sure I can't
get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.


158
00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:38.716
( Boys Chatting, 
Keys Jingling )

159
00:16:38.794 --> 00:16:40.819
- Anyway, I think they're here.
- Oh, yeah.


160
00:16:43.565 --> 00:16:46.466
- ( Boys Chatting )
- ( Mary ) Hold on, guys.


161
00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:49.160
Hold on.

162
00:16:49.237 --> 00:16:51.262
- ( Boys Together ) Hi, Dad!
- Hi, guys.


163
00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:53.739
- ( Boys Together ) Hi, Freddy.
- Hi, darling.


164
00:16:53.809 --> 00:16:56.869
- We've got a visitor.
- Come on, Dad.


165
00:17:02.017 --> 00:17:03.985
Well...

166
00:17:06.888 --> 00:17:09.220
look at this.

167
00:17:11.126 --> 00:17:15.028
My own kids
call me Freddy.


168
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.864
- You look wonderful.
- Wonderful, I think,
would be pushing it.


169
00:17:22.938 --> 00:17:26.533
No, you do.
You look wonderful.


170
00:17:27.442 --> 00:17:29.376
Thank you.

171
00:17:30.912 --> 00:17:35.747
So, how's business?

172
00:17:35.817 --> 00:17:38.377
So-so.

173
00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:41.251
You know, it's a little jewelry store.
What can I say?


174
00:17:41.323 --> 00:17:44.019
It's business.

175
00:17:44.092 --> 00:17:47.027
What about you?
You still doin' the real estate?


176
00:17:47.095 --> 00:17:49.825
Well, it's a tough market
right now.


177
00:17:49.898 --> 00:17:53.493
I'm still representing
some properties.


178
00:17:53.568 --> 00:17:58.665
But Roger's been doing so well,
I've been able to back off some.
Spend more time with the kids.


179
00:17:59.775 --> 00:18:02.710
Oh, well, wonderful.

180
00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:07.715
That's, uh, yeah--
That's, uh, really wonderful.


181
00:18:07.783 --> 00:18:10.479
Um--

182
00:18:10.552 --> 00:18:12.520
Um...

183
00:18:14.222 --> 00:18:17.248
Mary, there's, uh, something
that you should know.


184
00:18:17.325 --> 00:18:22.194
It's the reason
I came here.


185
00:18:22.264 --> 00:18:25.097
- Freddy--
- I've got something I wanna tell you.


186
00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:28.500
You made me a promise.
I hope you're gonna keep it.


187
00:18:29.905 --> 00:18:34.706
Two things:
I made you a promise. That's one.


188
00:18:34.776 --> 00:18:39.236
And I have great news.
That's two.


189
00:18:39.314 --> 00:18:41.373
Now, you gonna let me speak
or not?


190
00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:46.553
I'm sorry.
What's your great news?


191
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:49.249
( Sighs, Muttering )

192
00:18:49.324 --> 00:18:52.293
It's really great news.
I mean, spectacular news.


193
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.922
- I'm tellin' ya.
You wanna hear it or not?
- Mm-hmm.


194
00:18:56.998 --> 00:18:59.398
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


195
00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:01.059
- Are you ready?
- Yes.


196
00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:05.806
He's out.

197
00:19:05.874 --> 00:19:09.810
John Booth is out.

198
00:19:09.878 --> 00:19:11.812
I'm gonna kill him.

199
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.745
Get out of here, Freddy.

200
00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:17.216
I'm not goin' anywhere until I see you
courageous enough to tell the truth.


201
00:19:17.285 --> 00:19:19.810
The truth?
What truth, Freddy?


202
00:19:19.888 --> 00:19:22.550
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't? Wouldn't what, Mary?


203
00:19:22.624 --> 00:19:25.889
- Mention our daughter? Why?
Because you'd blackmail me?
- Blackmail?


204
00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:29.294
If I ever, ever want to speak
to the mother of my children,


205
00:19:29.364 --> 00:19:31.389
I must never mention
my daughter!


206
00:19:31.466 --> 00:19:34.731
- Get out of our house!
- This is my house.


207
00:19:34.803 --> 00:19:38.136
By any natural law,
this is my house!


208
00:19:38.206 --> 00:19:41.733
If my children live here,
my children,


209
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.803
then who's to say that I can't come here
to see 'em any fuckin' time I want to?


210
00:19:45.881 --> 00:19:48.975
- You had to do it, huh?
- Nobody's talkin' to you!


211
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.644
- You want me to call the police?
- Call whoever the fuck you want.


212
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.883
Where do you get off calling
them your children? You haven't
been a father to those kids.


213
00:19:54.956 --> 00:19:58.517
- You stopped with our daughter.
- Emily is her name.


214
00:19:58.593 --> 00:20:01.960
Yes, Emily. Emily!
And she is dead.


215
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.329
But I owe those two little boys
up there all the love I've got.


216
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.234
And it kills you that I can
give it to them and that you can't!


217
00:20:11.973 --> 00:20:15.067
( Roger ) Freddy, I want you
to leave our home--


218
00:20:15.143 --> 00:20:18.579
- Tell the truth, Mary. You
want me to kill John Booth!
- Let go of him!


219
00:20:18.647 --> 00:20:23.175
That's my job in life, and your job is
to go on as though nothing happened!


220
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:26.186
- Let go of him!
- Freddy!


221
00:20:26.254 --> 00:20:29.712
Freddy, why don't you let me go?
I'll make us some coffee.


222
00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:32.589
Come on.

223
00:20:32.661 --> 00:20:35.687
Coffee. Good.

224
00:20:35.764 --> 00:20:37.925
I'd like some coffee.

225
00:20:37.999 --> 00:20:42.959
Why don't we all just sit down,
have some coffee and
talk about this civilly?


226
00:20:43.038 --> 00:20:45.802
Come on.

227
00:20:45.874 --> 00:20:49.469
( Sighs )
You know what?


228
00:20:52.847 --> 00:20:55.407
I don't want any coffee.
I--


229
00:20:57.619 --> 00:21:00.417
I don't like coffee at all.
It makes my heart-- ( Slapping Chest )


230
00:21:00.488 --> 00:21:03.787
- You just said you wanted coffee.
- No.


231
00:21:03.858 --> 00:21:05.723
You sure?

232
00:21:05.794 --> 00:21:10.993
Yes. Uh... no.

233
00:21:11.066 --> 00:21:13.296
I'm gonna go.

234
00:21:14.402 --> 00:21:17.462
I feel good.

235
00:21:20.442 --> 00:21:25.402
- He just showed up
at the door. I didn't--
- Jesus, God, Roger.


236
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.415
I just want to say this.

237
00:21:28.483 --> 00:21:31.281
I've done a lot of things
for you, you know.


238
00:21:31.353 --> 00:21:33.583
A lot of things.

239
00:21:33.655 --> 00:21:38.115
And I think it's cheap of you
that you won't hear me out
on things. I really do.


240
00:21:38.193 --> 00:21:41.629
- Mary's just upset.
- Excuse me, but I am not upset.


241
00:21:41.696 --> 00:21:45.894
If you think I'm gonna keep
score on who's done what to who,
you're very fucking wrong!


242
00:21:45.967 --> 00:21:48.458
And if you think that's cheap,
then fuck you!


243
00:21:48.536 --> 00:21:52.768
I don't know if you're serious
about killing this man or not,
but I do know this.


244
00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:55.139
It has nothing to do
with our daughter.


245
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.906
Our little girl is gone, Freddy,
and she's not coming back...


246
00:21:57.979 --> 00:22:01.039
no matter what you do!

247
00:22:01.116 --> 00:22:05.143
You've never even been to the
cemetery, Freddy. You've never
even been to Emily's grave.


248
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.347
Why?

249
00:22:07.422 --> 00:22:12.189
Because I didn't go to
your little party? Your funeral?


250
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.356
I went on my own time,
Mary... in private.


251
00:22:16.431 --> 00:22:19.025
- Oh, really?
- Yes.


252
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.592
Then you're a braver man
than I thought.


253
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.195
What's the inscription
on the stone, Freddy?


254
00:22:26.708 --> 00:22:28.972
What color is it?

255
00:22:29.044 --> 00:22:31.842
Is it on a hill?
Is it under a tree?


256
00:22:31.913 --> 00:22:35.508
Does it lay flat or does it
stick up out of the ground?


257
00:22:42.157 --> 00:22:45.024
That's what I thought.

258
00:22:47.128 --> 00:22:51.292
Roger, man to man,

259
00:22:51.366 --> 00:22:53.732
when you two read
in the newspaper...


260
00:22:53.802 --> 00:22:56.896
that John Booth
has been shot dead,


261
00:22:56.971 --> 00:23:02.409
I want you to look
into her face and tell me if
you don't see pride and relief.


262
00:23:02.477 --> 00:23:06.072
Pride and relief,
Mary.


263
00:23:22.197 --> 00:23:27.692
## ( Whistling )

264
00:23:36.978 --> 00:23:39.811
## ( Whistling Continues )

265
00:24:07.942 --> 00:24:09.910
( Man ) So, listen to me.

266
00:24:09.978 --> 00:24:12.446
I'm comin' out of the bathroom,
right?


267
00:24:12.514 --> 00:24:15.449
And these two Orientals,
they're arguin', they're hollerin'.


268
00:24:15.517 --> 00:24:18.315
They're screamin'
at one another, and all in Japanese.


269
00:24:18.386 --> 00:24:20.115
So, I told 'em.

270
00:24:20.188 --> 00:24:25.387
I said, "Hey, you're in
America now. Speak Spanish."


271
00:24:27.829 --> 00:24:32.266
- Geez, you fucking guys.
Have a miserable evening.
- ( Men Laughing )


272
00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:35.666
- ( Men Laughing )
- What was he doin' in the mens' room?


273
00:24:35.737 --> 00:24:39.332
Hey, Freddy. Freddy.
What?


274
00:24:39.407 --> 00:24:41.341
Hey, Freddy, you with us?

275
00:24:41.409 --> 00:24:44.606
I think we hypnotized him.
Freddy!


276
00:24:45.847 --> 00:24:48.748
- Yeah?
- He's on the rag.


277
00:24:48.816 --> 00:24:52.308
( Men Laughing )

278
00:24:52.387 --> 00:24:57.120
Did any of you guys ever have
a sound build up in your head...


279
00:24:57.192 --> 00:25:00.025
over a period of days?

280
00:25:00.094 --> 00:25:02.619
Like a vacuum cleaner?

281
00:25:02.697 --> 00:25:06.690
That the last time
you had an original thought,


282
00:25:06.768 --> 00:25:09.566
you got cocky
and rode on it?


283
00:25:09.637 --> 00:25:13.164
- Rode what?
- Rode on the thought.


284
00:25:14.509 --> 00:25:16.670
Enjoyed it...

285
00:25:18.112 --> 00:25:23.140
'til you started hearin' that
vacuum cleaner in your brain.


286
00:25:23.218 --> 00:25:27.712
- But you don't mean tonight.
- ( Laughing ) No.
He means some other night.


287
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:30.485
Take my advice, Freddy.

288
00:25:30.558 --> 00:25:33.459
Get yourself a "youngie" and go
on one of them Laguna weekends.


289
00:25:33.528 --> 00:25:37.020
( Men Laughing )

290
00:25:45.373 --> 00:25:48.069
I gotta take off.
I'll see you guys later.


291
00:25:48.142 --> 00:25:50.906
Freddy, where you goin'?
It's only 11:00.


292
00:25:50.979 --> 00:25:52.742
Oh, man.

293
00:25:52.814 --> 00:25:54.748
Commitments.

294
00:25:54.816 --> 00:25:58.843
He's gonna go turn off the fuckin'
vacuum cleaner! ( Laughing )

no fuckin' clip. You cock.

00:28:37.178 --> 00:28:39.646
All right
I get a cigarette?


305
00:28:42.717 --> 00:28:44.651
All right.

306
00:28:57.465 --> 00:28:59.433
You know--

307
00:29:02.336 --> 00:29:05.169
Would you mind closin' the door?
I don't want to wake my parents.


308
00:29:12.547 --> 00:29:15.482
Might fuckin' wake
his fuckin' parents.


309
00:29:26.494 --> 00:29:28.462
When the thing happened,

310
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.094
I wanted to be dead.

311
00:29:38.439 --> 00:29:42.967
But there wasn't--
You know.


312
00:29:43.044 --> 00:29:46.377
I didn't want
your forgiveness.


313
00:29:46.447 --> 00:29:50.543
I didn't think I deserved it.
And I don't think I do.


314
00:29:54.021 --> 00:29:55.989
But...

315
00:30:05.099 --> 00:30:07.067
I guess you, uh...

316
00:30:08.603 --> 00:30:11.595
you've been waitin' for this day
for a long time.


317
00:30:11.672 --> 00:30:14.436
It's all right.
Sit down.


318
00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.914
Sit down.

319
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.613
I know it's been
a long wait.


320
00:30:25.686 --> 00:30:28.814
But I'm not goin' anywhere.

321
00:30:31.692 --> 00:30:35.526
I'm not callin' any cops.

322
00:30:35.596 --> 00:30:39.862
I'll just be here,
trying to get on with things.


323
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:50.570
Would you maybe,
you know--


324
00:30:53.748 --> 00:30:57.479
Would you take
a couple days...


325
00:30:57.552 --> 00:31:00.578
and maybe think about
not takin' my life?


326
00:31:00.655 --> 00:31:03.624
Look.

327
00:31:03.691 --> 00:31:08.424
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.


328
00:31:08.496 --> 00:31:13.024
That's all I got.
That's it. That's what I am.


329
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.898
- Understand what I'm talkin' about?
- I think I do.


330
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.430
Shut up! Because you don't.
You don't understand. You don't!


331
00:31:22.843 --> 00:31:24.834
All right.

332
00:31:41.062 --> 00:31:44.759
I'm gonna give you
three days.


333
00:31:44.832 --> 00:31:46.891
Three days.

334
00:31:51.339 --> 00:31:54.274
Then maybe I'll remember
the fuckin' clip for this gun.


335
00:31:54.342 --> 00:31:55.969
Son of a bitch!

336
00:31:58.145 --> 00:32:02.172
( Speaking Spanish )

337
00:32:02.249 --> 00:32:05.912
( Woman On TV
) And up. Let's go!

338
00:32:05.987 --> 00:32:08.979
We're warming up.
Get that blood flowing.


339
00:32:09.056 --> 00:32:12.355
Again.
Now tuck your arms.


340
00:32:12.426 --> 00:32:15.554
Front and back.
And step.


341
00:32:25.973 --> 00:32:29.136
I don't want another ring.
I want this ring in a size seven.


342
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.201
Don't you understand?

343
00:32:31.278 --> 00:32:35.408
I was a seven on Tuesday and I'm
a seven today. This is not a seven.


344
00:32:35.483 --> 00:32:37.508
( Jefferey ) You have a swollen
finger one day, not the next.


345
00:32:37.585 --> 00:32:40.315
( Woman ) I want to speak to the owner.
It's not a seven.


346
00:32:40.388 --> 00:32:43.585
It's maybe a six,
a six and a half.


347
00:32:43.658 --> 00:32:47.287
- I sized your finger two times.
- I wanted to wear this ring tonight.


348
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:49.727
I have a very important
engagement tonight.


349
00:32:49.797 --> 00:32:52.265
No, I don't want another ring.
I want this ring...


350
00:32:52.333 --> 00:32:54.824
- in a size seven like I ordered it.
- May I help you, ma'am?


351
00:32:54.902 --> 00:32:58.998
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I would be
the proprietor in question.


352
00:32:59.073 --> 00:33:04.306
Thank God. I told this Jap faggot
I ordered this ring size seven.


353
00:33:04.378 --> 00:33:06.846
My ring size has always been a seven.
This is not a seven.


354
00:33:06.914 --> 00:33:09.747
- It won't even fit on my hand.
- May I see the ring, please?


355
00:33:09.817 --> 00:33:13.344
Yeah. It won't fit on my finger,
my hand. It won't fit anything.


356
00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:16.584
It's a six and a half.
Six and three-quarters maybe.


357
00:33:19.694 --> 00:33:22.561
Does that look like a
six fuckin' and a half to you?


358
00:33:24.331 --> 00:33:26.731
Ahh.

359
00:33:26.801 --> 00:33:29.395
You were right.
You're a perfect seven.


360
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.530
A perfect fucking seven.

361
00:33:52.293 --> 00:33:56.320
Do you know where
this bus turns around?


362
00:33:59.934 --> 00:34:02.232
Pardon?

363
00:34:02.303 --> 00:34:05.864
Does this bus stay
in Glendale?


364
00:34:10.244 --> 00:34:12.576
I don't know.

365
00:34:14.148 --> 00:34:18.380
Does it turn around
and come back to Marge Street?


366
00:34:18.452 --> 00:34:20.443
I don't know.

367
00:34:23.958 --> 00:34:27.826
- Do you come back to Marge Street?
- No.


368
00:34:32.233 --> 00:34:35.725
My sister has a car.

369
00:34:35.803 --> 00:34:38.567
A Valiant.

370
00:34:41.108 --> 00:34:45.169
-Did you ever get to ride in a Valiant?
-No.


371
00:34:45.246 --> 00:34:49.114
My sister has
a green Valiant.


372
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:58.791
I ride the bus
all day long.


373
00:34:58.859 --> 00:35:01.987
( Laughing )

374
00:35:02.062 --> 00:35:04.758
I have
a disability card...


375
00:35:04.832 --> 00:35:07.164
so I don't have to pay.

376
00:35:07.234 --> 00:35:09.828
( Laughing )

377
00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:47.573
( Girl ) Daddy!

378
00:36:12.867 --> 00:36:15.097
( Phone Rings )

379
00:36:17.004 --> 00:36:18.938
Hello.
Mary Manning.


380
00:36:20.007 --> 00:36:22.805
Hello?

381
00:36:30.451 --> 00:36:34.683
- Hey, what's in the news?
- Hey! Get in the car.


382
00:36:34.755 --> 00:36:37.656
Okay, we're late.

383
00:36:37.725 --> 00:36:39.659
- But you got the job.
- Yeah.


384
00:36:39.727 --> 00:36:41.695
- You start at 6:00 in the morning.
- Oh, man.


385
00:36:41.762 --> 00:36:44.196
It's a boat.
It's a good job.


386
00:36:44.265 --> 00:36:47.792
Second, there's a bunch of people
at my house. It's a party for you.


387
00:36:47.868 --> 00:36:50.428
- A party?
- Girls.


388
00:36:50.504 --> 00:36:54.065
- Wow.
- But we're not goin' anywhere until--


389
00:36:54.141 --> 00:36:56.075
- ln the joint,
- Yeah?


390
00:36:56.143 --> 00:36:59.271
did you get
butt-fucked?


391
00:36:59.346 --> 00:37:01.746
It only hurts
the first time.


392
00:37:01.815 --> 00:37:03.112
I know.

393
00:37:05.286 --> 00:37:09.916
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #


394
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.858
# I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #


395
00:37:13.928 --> 00:37:17.989
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #


396
00:37:18.065 --> 00:37:21.967
- # I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #
- Yee-hoo!


397
00:37:22.036 --> 00:37:25.972
# I will die before my time
But then my kind always do #


398
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:31.273
# I will die before my time
I will die ##


399
00:37:31.345 --> 00:37:35.577
- ( Laughing )
- ( Sunny ) Take your hands out
of your pockets. Let's hear it.


400
00:37:35.649 --> 00:37:39.517
That's Verna. Come on, now.
Let's open up your sphincter...


401
00:37:39.586 --> 00:37:41.781
and let the sunlight in.
Verna!


402
00:37:41.855 --> 00:37:43.789
Oh, Verna,
come on, girl.


403
00:37:43.857 --> 00:37:46.382
You better hurry up.
We're gonna be late. Nicky Blair's!


404
00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.451
- I didn't know. Is she goin'?
- Of course she's goin'.


405
00:37:51.665 --> 00:37:54.361
I thought it was just
gonna be you and me. Dinner?


406
00:37:54.435 --> 00:37:57.495
Well, we can't do it
in a restaurant, Verna.


407
00:37:57.571 --> 00:38:00.802
What difference does it make?
Geez.


408
00:38:00.874 --> 00:38:03.502
You wanna go or not?
Come on. Huh?


409
00:38:03.577 --> 00:38:07.035
Whoever wants to go, come on,
let's go. I'll wait in the car.


410
00:38:07.114 --> 00:38:09.878
( Woman ) Hey!

411
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.885
The train's
a-movin' on.


412
00:38:12.953 --> 00:38:15.717
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Let's go.


413
00:38:15.789 --> 00:38:19.919
- Yeah, let's go. Let's have fun.
Let's, ha-ha, party, huh?
- Verna?


414
00:38:19.994 --> 00:38:22.724
( Woman ) And I'm talking
to you before about compassion,
how you have compassion...


415
00:38:22.796 --> 00:38:26.926
for people, and you decide every day
who deserves compassion and who doesn't.


416
00:38:27.001 --> 00:38:28.935
That's your spirituality.

417
00:38:29.003 --> 00:38:32.530
If somebody is black and dying on the
street, then they deserve compassion.


418
00:38:32.606 --> 00:38:35.598
And if somebody is rich and their sister
dies, they get a little bit.


419
00:38:35.676 --> 00:38:39.043
But if somebody is rich and they
have a bad day, forget it.


420
00:38:39.113 --> 00:38:44.016
They don't deserve a bit of compassion.
You haven't lived that person's life.


421
00:38:44.084 --> 00:38:47.679
But because they don't have
any identifiable things
that deserve compassion,


422
00:38:47.755 --> 00:38:49.689
you don't give it to them.

423
00:38:49.757 --> 00:38:53.591
Not once have I seen you
do that.


424
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.220
Oh, I make him feel bad.
Let me tell a joke.


425
00:38:56.296 --> 00:38:58.127
Okay. Well--
( Laughing )


426
00:38:58.198 --> 00:39:00.530
## ( Jazz )

427
00:39:02.102 --> 00:39:05.594
Nine is taken.
I'll give him 22. Okay?


428
00:39:05.672 --> 00:39:08.300
- Hello, Mr. Gale. Good to see you.
- Nick, how are you tonight?


429
00:39:08.375 --> 00:39:10.036
You look so good.
Hello, ladies.


430
00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.443
Mr. Gale, listen. I've got
a great, great, great booth for you.


431
00:39:13.514 --> 00:39:15.880
It's a half a booth, but we're
gonna get the other half--


432
00:39:15.949 --> 00:39:18.315
- Here. Take their coats quickly.
- Uh, half a booth?


433
00:39:18.385 --> 00:39:21.718
Yes. But don't worry. We're gonna get
the other booth in about 15 minutes.


434
00:39:21.789 --> 00:39:23.780
- At nine, you mean.
- It's right by the bar.
I couldn't get that one.


435
00:39:23.857 --> 00:39:26.849
- Is it nine?
- No, no. Don't worry about nine.
Here, take this.


436
00:39:26.927 --> 00:39:28.656
Come on, girls.
Look how beautiful they are.


437
00:39:28.729 --> 00:39:31.459
- You're always with
pretty girls, Mr. Gale.
- ( Girls Giggling )


438
00:39:31.532 --> 00:39:34.558
# Can't last #

439
00:39:34.635 --> 00:39:38.901
# Any time
Any place #


440
00:39:38.972 --> 00:39:43.966
This-- This is, uh,
a nice table, huh?


441
00:39:44.044 --> 00:39:46.842
- It's fine. Fine.
- I guess.


442
00:39:46.914 --> 00:39:50.509
- We can see the bar really good.
- ( Laughing )


443
00:39:50.584 --> 00:39:53.951
Forgive me. I have this painting.
Jojo did this painting.


444
00:39:54.021 --> 00:39:56.489
After years of bullshit,

445
00:39:56.557 --> 00:40:00.118
I'm sorry, finally reaches a point
where she does this incredible work.


446
00:40:00.194 --> 00:40:02.424
She smears herself with paint,
she rolls herself around...


447
00:40:02.496 --> 00:40:04.760
on a,
on a piece of canvass--


448
00:40:04.832 --> 00:40:06.493
- Paper.
- Paper.


449
00:40:06.567 --> 00:40:09.832
You were trying
to represent God.


450
00:40:09.903 --> 00:40:14.670
Right? Okay.
Uh, just allow me this.


451
00:40:14.741 --> 00:40:18.006
But what she ends up with
is an image of herself.


452
00:40:18.078 --> 00:40:20.444
She looks for God
and she finds,


453
00:40:20.514 --> 00:40:23.415
she finds herself.

( Verna ) Ate all the clams
in the house, did you?

( Jennifer ) Oh, don't torture
yourself, sweetheart.

You girls seem to be having
a good time. You must be a funny guy.

I'm a riot.

464
00:40:58.018 --> 00:41:02.079
- Now get the fuck outta here.
- I didn't mean anything.
I just stopped by, having fun.


465
00:41:02.156 --> 00:41:05.557
- Nothin' personal.
- Go have your fun somewhere else.
Just get the fuck outta here.


466
00:41:05.626 --> 00:41:09.653
Relax. I don't mean any offense
by this. I just thought maybe
you'd like extra help here.


467
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.858
You got some pretty girls here.
Maybe you need some help.


468
00:41:12.933 --> 00:41:15.697
- I don't need no fuckin' help!
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:41:15.769 --> 00:41:17.703
Take it easy!

a point on it, but...


477
00:41:42.129 --> 00:41:45.292
you know
something about confinement.


478
00:41:45.365 --> 00:41:49.461
- I think we all know
something about confinement.
- Well, there's confinement...

00:41:49.536 --> 00:41:52.505

confinement.

I know what you mean.

Yeah, at the risk of sounding like
I know what I'm talking about,

What you're talking about.

You know, if there isn't
something bigger than, uh,

than freedom,

486
00:42:13.093 --> 00:42:16.085
then freedom
is just entertainment.

00:42:16.163 --> 00:42:17.653
Entertainment?

488
00:42:25.305 --> 00:42:29.537

- We transmit downtown.

- Everybody?
- Everybody that gets booked.

- Murderers too?
- Especially murderers.

- Not personally. Have you?

he threatened to kill me last night.

It was an accident,
right?

00:43:40.047 --> 00:43:42.743
Was he serious?
You, you-- Serious?

I think he was serious.

I think he's a serious man.

You're the only person
I've told.

Why?

511
00:43:57.597 --> 00:43:59.588
Well, I--

512
00:44:01.435 --> 00:44:04.598
I think I thought
it would be romantic.


513
00:44:11.712 --> 00:44:14.613
Why would you
want to be romantic?


514
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.420
How'd you get
that scar on your head?


515
00:44:26.493 --> 00:44:29.656
Banged my head
against the wall.


516
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:33.166
- ln jail?
- Uh-huh.


517
00:44:34.568 --> 00:44:37.401
You or somebody else?

518
00:44:38.872 --> 00:44:40.965
- You?
- Mm-hmm.


519
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:43.305
You just couldn't stand jail?

520
00:44:43.377 --> 00:44:46.676
No. I just couldn't
stand me.


521
00:44:51.952 --> 00:44:57.413
Yeah, I was gonna call, but
it got so late, I didn't think
you guys would be up.


522
00:44:57.491 --> 00:44:59.356
( Helen ) Of course we're up!

523
00:44:59.426 --> 00:45:01.860
You just got home.
We want to see you.


524
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:06.599
I'm sorry.
It's just, uh--


525
00:45:06.666 --> 00:45:10.102
- I got the job.
- Ah, good.


526
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:14.197
And Peter and his brother threw me
a coming-home party.


527
00:45:14.274 --> 00:45:16.265
The day
just kinda happened.

00:45:16.343 --> 00:45:20.609
- When do you start on the boat?
- Actually in a few hours.


529
00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.478
Why do you stay out so late
before you start a job?


530
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:27.646
Your friends don't care
if you get any rest.


531
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:32.590
Something hit me tonight.

532
00:45:32.659 --> 00:45:35.127
It was a strange night.

533
00:45:38.999 --> 00:45:41.433
You know, uh,

534
00:45:45.639 --> 00:45:48.608
( Sighs )
I've done a horrible thing.


535
00:45:48.675 --> 00:45:51.473
And, uh,

536
00:45:51.545 --> 00:45:54.514
I'm always
gonna feel the guiIt...


537
00:45:54.581 --> 00:45:56.708
and remorse.

538
00:45:57.884 --> 00:46:00.444
But...

539
00:46:01.788 --> 00:46:06.225
when you hear about
a thing like that,


540
00:46:06.293 --> 00:46:11.253
about someone who has
to carry a thing like that,


541
00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:16.761
when you're in it,
it's just, it's--


542
00:46:16.837 --> 00:46:18.828
( Sighs )

543
00:46:21.575 --> 00:46:24.908
It's very different...

544
00:46:24.978 --> 00:46:27.879
from what you might think.

545
00:46:30.617 --> 00:46:34.212
( Sighs )
I'm not an unhappy person.


546
00:46:34.287 --> 00:46:39.190
I'm just--
( Clears Throat ) I'm just--


547
00:46:39.259 --> 00:46:43.719
I'm someone who has caused
a lot of... unhappiness.


548
00:46:45.332 --> 00:46:48.563
And a person
who's caused death.


549
00:46:57.611 --> 00:47:01.570
I, uh,
I love you...


550
00:47:01.648 --> 00:47:05.277
both so much.

551
00:47:05.352 --> 00:47:09.948
Not just as my parents,
but...


552
00:47:10.023 --> 00:47:13.117
as two people who,

553
00:47:13.193 --> 00:47:17.755
who stood by
and kept giving...


554
00:47:20.133 --> 00:47:23.830
your love... to that person.

555
00:47:26.706 --> 00:47:28.674
That person...

556
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:35.079
who has also caused you both
so much pain.


557
00:47:35.148 --> 00:47:40.085
You're our son.
Of course we love you.


558
00:47:40.153 --> 00:47:42.121
No matter what.

559
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.293
( Verna ) Let's get this straight,
girl. Everyone gets paid by the hour.


560
00:47:50.363 --> 00:47:55.062
- Listen, I'll see you in a bit.
- Ah, Jefferey. Thank you.
Here, hold this.


561
00:47:55.135 --> 00:47:57.603
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, thank you.


562
00:47:57.671 --> 00:48:01.163
I'm, uh,
I'm fuckin' delighted.


563
00:48:02.842 --> 00:48:06.278
- Please. We can do
a fashion show outside.
- Thank you.


564
00:48:06.346 --> 00:48:09.179
- Who is that, Jefferey?
- It's my boyfriend Gene.


565
00:48:09.249 --> 00:48:11.410
- Did you get the car?
- Yeah. The car's outside.


566
00:48:11.484 --> 00:48:14.510
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
Okay. All right.
- ( Women ) Finally!


567
00:48:14.588 --> 00:48:17.921
- Are you okay?
- I'm just fuckin' great.


568

- I can't get this thing.

-Don't worry about it, man.
