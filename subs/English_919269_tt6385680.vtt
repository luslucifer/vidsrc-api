00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:32.726
<i>Once upon a time,
the world was a mess.</i>


2
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.333
<i>There was a pandemic,</i>

3
00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:42.036
<i>and then another
and then another.</i>


4
00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:45.706
<i>Life, as the human race
knew it,</i>


5
00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:49.043
<i>was a disaster
in every sense of the word.</i>


6
00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:53.647
<i>Then, one day,
a scientist came along</i>


7
00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.817
<i>with a genetic discovery
that changed everything.</i>


8
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.621
<i>He shared his vision
with the world.</i>


9
00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:03.557
<i>It was a solution
so incredible and epic in scope</i>


10
00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.660
<i>that life on Earth
would not only resume</i>


11
00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:10.164
<i>but it would be like
living in a fairytale.</i>


12
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.500
<i>A chance to live
in a perfect world.</i>


13
00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:15.869
<i>An eternal dream.</i>

14
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:17.471
<i>The problem was</i>

15
00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:20.741
<i>no-one really thought through
the consequences.</i>


16
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.878
<i>Soon my life changes forever.</i>

17
00:01:58.614 --> 00:02:02.282
<i>I'll be given the gift
of being frozen in time,</i>


18
00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:05.452
<i>the gift of never dying.</i>

19
00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:08.555
<i>A gift that
everyone on this train</i>


20
00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:10.824
<i>and in this city</i>

21
00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.760
<i>either has or will receive.</i>

22
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.172
<i>Arrival. Wildzone.</i>

23
00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:34.648
<i>The problem is</i>

24
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.718
<i>I'm not so sure
I see it as a gift.</i>


25
00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:21.295
<i>C.S. Lewis once said that
free will makes evil possible.</i>


26
00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:26.833
<i>But it's also the only thing
that makes possible love...</i>


27
00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:37.611
<i>..goodness...</i>

28
00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:43.383
<i>..joy.</i>

29
00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:11.645
<i>It seems so romantic...</i>

30
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:15.315
<i>..the notion of living forever.</i>

31
00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:17.284
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

32
00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:22.089
<i>But I ask you this...</i>

33
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.628
<i>..how can you really live</i>

34
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.797
<i>if you know
you're never going to die?</i>


35
00:04:43.746 --> 00:04:46.613
<i>I am immortal.</i>

36
00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:48.882
<i>We at the machine are immortal.</i>

37
00:04:48.884 --> 00:04:54.855
<i>And you, all of you,
can be immortal as well.</i>


38
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:58.692
<i>Life as we know it
is forever changed.</i>


39
00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:01.161
<i>I will not only give
each and every one of you</i>


40
00:05:01.163 --> 00:05:03.530
<i>the gift of eternal life,</i>

41
00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:07.534
<i>but I will also give you
the gift of freezing in time</i>


42
00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:11.238
<i>when you have reached
your peak perfection.</i>


43
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.908
<i>I will eliminate,
through our applications,</i>


44
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.146
<i>the bad and most ugly
of our human emotions.</i>


45
00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:24.084
<i>And I will eliminate suffering
from injury</i>


46
00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:27.587
<i>and illness
and emotional duress.</i>


47
00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:33.327
<i>I am the Pilot
taking you into this new world</i>


48
00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:37.331
<i>and I will always serve you.</i>

49
00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:39.366
As you all know,

50
00:05:39.368 --> 00:05:41.935
the Pilot gave birth
to our society.


51
00:05:41.937 --> 00:05:44.571
No-one had to die ever again.

52
00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:47.741
- Some didn't follow him, though.
- That's correct.


53
00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:50.911
Unfortunately
they all eventually died.


54
00:05:50.913 --> 00:05:54.414
Once the Pilot's reprogramming
of the genetic code took effect,


55
00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:56.049
the world and its people

56
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:57.884
functioned
much more efficiently.


57
00:05:57.886 --> 00:06:01.388
We saw the end of war,
borders and political divide.


58
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.490
We became one nation.

59
00:06:08.597 --> 00:06:11.698
Let's take a look at
the process of the Code.


60
00:06:12.434 --> 00:06:13.700
Shem application.

61
00:06:13.702 --> 00:06:15.602
Of course all of you know
what it is,


62
00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:17.337
but I bet
it's pretty amazing to see


63
00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:19.906
such an extraordinary event
with your own eyes.


64
00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:23.543
<i>Extraordinary? Depends on
how you look at things.</i>


65
00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:27.214
<i>In this moment, this woman
will be frozen in time forever</i>


66
00:06:27.216 --> 00:06:28.915
<i>because, as deemed by the Pilot,</i>

67
00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:32.486
<i>she's reached her peak potential
as a human being.</i>


68
00:06:32.488 --> 00:06:35.288
<i>For most people,
this happens around age 25.</i>


69
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.025
<i>Some younger, some older.</i>

70
00:06:39.027 --> 00:06:40.494
<i>For me,</i>

71
00:06:40.496 --> 00:06:42.362
<i>that time is now.</i>

72
00:06:42.364 --> 00:06:44.498
<i>The most important day
of my life,</i>


73
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.533
<i>the day I become immortal,</i>

74
00:06:46.535 --> 00:06:48.535
<i>is just days away.</i>

75
00:06:48.537 --> 00:06:50.170
Pretty incredible, isn't it?

76
00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:52.139
<i>I should be excited
but I'm not.</i>


77
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:55.175
Right, we better get going.
Almost late for lunch.


78
00:06:55.177 --> 00:06:57.411
<i>I'm filled with fear.</i>

79
00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.015
<i>Welcome to</i>

80
00:07:02.017 --> 00:07:03.950
<i>the Alisandre train station.</i>

81
00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:05.952
<i>I feel alone.</i>

82
00:07:05.954 --> 00:07:10.090
<i>Like no-one else sees the world
the way I do.</i>


83
00:07:12.428 --> 00:07:15.095
<i>But deep down, I know
I can't be the only one</i>


84
00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:17.097
<i>that thinks these things,</i>

85
00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:19.466
<i>feels these things.</i>

86
00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:23.637
<i>The problem is,
in the society I live in,</i>


87
00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.705
<i>it's too dangerous
to try and find them.</i>


88
00:07:25.707 --> 00:07:27.808
- I don't have a lot of time.
- Who are you?


89
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.377
The way you're thinking,
you are not crazy.


90
00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.312
- What do you mean?
- Reach me when you're ready.


91
00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:33.346
It's safe.

92
00:07:33.348 --> 00:07:35.048
When you use it,
our communication


93
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.249
won't be monitored.

94
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:40.554
Reach you?
Why would I do that?


95
00:07:40.556 --> 00:07:43.023
<i>But maybe they just found me.</i>

96
00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:50.997
Who are they?
What did she give him?


97
00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:52.699
I don't know.

98
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.469
The heart rate escalated
and the camera sensed it.


99
00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:59.005
Whatever it is, she didn't want
anyone to know.


100
00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:10.817
- Hi!
- You seem surprised to see me.


101
00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:12.152
I am.

102
00:08:12.154 --> 00:08:15.055
Very. Why are you here?

103
00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:18.258
The Pilot has something
he needs from my department


104
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.527
and I think
you might be able to help.


105
00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:23.129
The Pilot? Are you serious?

106
00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:25.365
I thought you might be excited.

107
00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:27.000
What is it he needs me for?

108
00:08:27.002 --> 00:08:31.538
I believe he'd like to
tell you that himself.


109
00:08:45.053 --> 00:08:46.953
Welcome.

110
00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:50.423
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Akae.


111
00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:53.593
Thank you.
The pleasure's all mine.


112
00:08:53.595 --> 00:08:56.663
I'm a very proud citizen
of Alisandre.


113
00:08:57.432 --> 00:08:58.798
You were right about her.

114
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.700
You're a guardian-in-training,
correct?


115
00:09:00.702 --> 00:09:03.670
It's been a lifelong dream
of mine.


116
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.374
It's wonderful to hear someone
have such a great desire


117
00:09:07.376 --> 00:09:11.077
to help keep harmony
and balance in our city.


118
00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:14.147
Let's see if we can't get you
one step closer to that dream.


119
00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:20.186
This man here is a terraforming
engineer by the name of Logos.


120
00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:21.488
He's approached by this woman.

121
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.124
A benign citizen
by all accounts.


122
00:09:24.126 --> 00:09:25.892
Both of them are, actually.

123
00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:28.595
Is there any reason
these two people


124
00:09:28.597 --> 00:09:30.163
shouldn't be communicating?

125
00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:32.132
Not that we know of.

126
00:09:32.134 --> 00:09:34.568
She handed something to him.

127
00:09:35.304 --> 00:09:36.636
What is that?

128
00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:38.538
That's what we'd like to
find out.


129
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.906
Probably nothing.

130
00:09:39.908 --> 00:09:43.043
We need someone
who isn't yet a guardian.


131
00:09:43.045 --> 00:09:45.145
We think you're the perfect
person for the job.


132
00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:15.675
Hello?

133
00:10:21.416 --> 00:10:23.617
Is there anyone there?

134
00:10:27.756 --> 00:10:29.789
<i>Logos?</i>

135
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:31.758
Yes.

136
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.260
<i>We're glad to hear from you.</i>

137
00:10:34.262 --> 00:10:35.795
Who's we?

138
00:10:35.797 --> 00:10:39.099
<i>Let's talk in person.
I'll tell you more then.</i>


139
00:10:39.101 --> 00:10:40.834
Where should we meet?

140
00:10:44.406 --> 00:10:46.940
<i>..Nescience Centre
to learn more about the Pilot</i>


141
00:10:46.942 --> 00:10:49.709
<i>and the ultimate gift
he has given us.</i>


142
00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.089
Glad you came.

143
00:11:39.528 --> 00:11:41.161
Just wanted to say
how great it was


144
00:11:41.163 --> 00:11:43.396
seeing you and Elomina
for dinner the other night.


145
00:11:43.398 --> 00:11:46.266
Elomina?

146
00:11:49.838 --> 00:11:52.939
Yeah. It was great.

147
00:11:52.941 --> 00:11:55.542
It's always nice to get together
with friends.


148
00:11:55.544 --> 00:11:58.645
Friends are very important.

149
00:11:58.647 --> 00:12:01.181
Always good to know
when you meet one.


150
00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:18.631
Here are the guardian reports
from this week.


151
00:12:18.633 --> 00:12:20.734
Is there anything from Akae?

152
00:12:20.736 --> 00:12:22.435
Turned out to be nothing.

153
00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:24.104
Are we sure?

154
00:12:24.106 --> 00:12:29.709
While I agree that their initial
interaction was... concerning,


155
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:32.278
Akae listened to
their entire conversation


156
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.446
from start to finish

157
00:12:33.448 --> 00:12:37.517
and I assure you there's nothing
to be worried about.


158
00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.819
I'd like her to keep going.

159
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:42.288
Are you certain?

160
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.157
There was nothing she said
that indicated...


161
00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:46.092
I'm sure.

162
00:12:50.499 --> 00:12:52.465
Is there something
I should know?


163
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.037
A man named Helias
used to work with the Pilot.


164
00:12:58.039 --> 00:13:00.507
He was a defective individual

165
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:04.778
who concocted something that
the Pilot describes as a virus,


166
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.347
something intended to destroy
the Code.


167
00:13:07.349 --> 00:13:10.717
Helias was rehabilitated,
his mind wiped clean,


168
00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:13.987
but the Pilot fears
his ideas remained,


169
00:13:13.989 --> 00:13:16.990
that somehow
they were passed down.


170
00:13:16.992 --> 00:13:18.892
And he thinks
that the woman Logos met


171
00:13:18.894 --> 00:13:20.894
might be one of these people?

172
00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:23.363
Maybe.

173
00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:27.400
Probably not if you ask me,
but he wants us...


174
00:13:27.402 --> 00:13:30.403
..you to make sure.

175
00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:52.392
I didn't think anybody reads
those things anymore.


176
00:13:53.328 --> 00:13:55.328
What is it?

177
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.163
Just a book.

178
00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:01.668
'Being and Nothingness'.

179
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.603
Sounds heavy.

180
00:14:03.605 --> 00:14:05.405
Kind of.

181
00:14:07.475 --> 00:14:09.576
I get it.

182
00:14:09.578 --> 00:14:11.678
Get what?

183
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.813
Wanting to read
something like that.


184
00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:17.584
You must be getting
your code confirmation soon.


185
00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:19.185
I am.

186
00:14:20.722 --> 00:14:24.057
Frozen in time
in your most perfect state.


187
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.360
The ultimate gift.

188
00:14:27.362 --> 00:14:29.262
That's what they say.

189
00:14:30.465 --> 00:14:32.465
What do you do?

190
00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:35.501
I'm an engineer. Terraforming.

191
00:14:36.438 --> 00:14:37.670
I work at Nescience.

192
00:14:37.672 --> 00:14:40.006
Are you a guardian?

193
00:14:40.742 --> 00:14:43.376
No, tour guide.

194
00:14:43.378 --> 00:14:46.813
I walk children
around the museum of our society


195
00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:50.283
and tell them about
how Shems work


196
00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:53.019
and how lucky we are
to get them.


197
00:14:53.021 --> 00:14:57.390
Do you believe
what you tell them every day?


198
00:15:01.563 --> 00:15:03.529
I don't know.

199
00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:07.700
Seems like something
you might want to figure out.


200
00:15:07.702 --> 00:15:09.235
It does.

201
00:15:09.237 --> 00:15:12.272
<i>Arrival. Nescience.</i>

202
00:15:12.274 --> 00:15:14.807
<i>Doors opening.</i>

203
00:15:14.809 --> 00:15:18.211
This is me.
Enjoy the rest of your day.


204
00:15:20.849 --> 00:15:22.582
You too.

205
00:15:42.103 --> 00:15:44.003
We couldn't find you earlier
so we put together


206
00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:46.439
the schedule for tomorrow
and posted it.


207
00:15:46.441 --> 00:15:47.840
I was just out for a bit.

208
00:15:47.842 --> 00:15:50.043
I had a couple of things
I had to do.


209
00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:51.811
Thanks, Suria. 
I appreciate it.

210
00:15:51.813 --> 00:15:53.246
Do you need anything else?

211
00:15:53.248 --> 00:15:55.882
I want you to look into
a citizen for me.


212
00:15:55.884 --> 00:15:57.350
He goes by Logos.

213
00:15:57.352 --> 00:16:00.720
You're sure
no-one followed you?


214
00:16:00.722 --> 00:16:02.588
I'm sure.

215
00:16:18.273 --> 00:16:20.840
The simplest explanation

216
00:16:20.842 --> 00:16:23.309
is that we're trying
to spread the truth.


217
00:16:23.311 --> 00:16:25.044
There's an entire world
of citizens


218
00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:27.046
just outside these doors
that believe


219
00:16:27.048 --> 00:16:30.717
they live a perfect life
in a perfect world.


220
00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:32.952
But you're not like them.

221
00:16:32.954 --> 00:16:34.754
And neither are we.

222
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.091
It's clear you're not on
your Maintenance,


223
00:16:38.093 --> 00:16:41.561
that you're opening your eyes
for the first time.


224
00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:43.997
But I'm on my Maintenance.

225
00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:45.431
I've never missed a dose.

226
00:16:45.433 --> 00:16:48.601
- That's impossible.
- It's true.


227
00:16:50.305 --> 00:16:53.573
I don't know how or why
this is happening to me.


228
00:16:54.776 --> 00:16:56.509
We are just like you.

229
00:16:56.511 --> 00:16:58.711
This is where you belong.

230
00:16:58.713 --> 00:17:00.680
You can go back to your life...

231
00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:03.549
..your book,

232
00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:06.019
or you can join us.

233
00:17:07.489 --> 00:17:10.323
Everyone in this world
deserves the chance


234
00:17:10.325 --> 00:17:13.326
to see things the way we do.

235
00:17:13.328 --> 00:17:14.761
You know that.

236
00:17:14.763 --> 00:17:18.131
- How?
- Follow us.


237
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.574
Are you developing an antidote
to the Maintenance?


238
00:17:28.576 --> 00:17:31.978
We've created a method to reduce
the efficacy of the Maintenance.


239
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.680
So, yes, an antidote of sorts.

240
00:17:34.682 --> 00:17:37.016
Medorin's been instrumental
in the process.


241
00:17:37.018 --> 00:17:38.451
She's a polymath.

242
00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:40.987
She knows more about the Code
and Maintenance than anyone.


243
00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:42.688
Thanks to the manual we located

244
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.858
of a man who worked very closely
with the Pilot many years ago.


245
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.760
Before humans lived forever.

246
00:17:47.762 --> 00:17:50.930
His shorthand was a bit
difficult to interpret,


247
00:17:50.932 --> 00:17:53.399
but ultimately,
after some trial and error,


248
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:55.334
we were able to get it right.

249
00:17:55.336 --> 00:17:58.638
- Who is this person?
- Helias was his name.


250
00:17:59.908 --> 00:18:02.175
Arcade is
our resident historian.


251
00:18:02.177 --> 00:18:04.143
There's not much about
the creation of Alisandre


252
00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:05.945
that he doesn't know.

253
00:18:05.947 --> 00:18:09.549
Sometimes I think there are
far more unknowns than knowns.


254
00:18:09.551 --> 00:18:12.285
Originally, Helias worked
closely with the Pilot


255
00:18:12.287 --> 00:18:14.620
in the development of the Code
and Maintenance.


256
00:18:14.622 --> 00:18:18.124
But once the Code was completed
and implemented worldwide,


257
00:18:18.126 --> 00:18:20.860
Helias discovered that the Pilot
had gone further.


258
00:18:20.862 --> 00:18:22.528
The Pilot had modified genes

259
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.398
that had nothing to do with
health or longevity.


260
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.767
Helias started asking questions.

261
00:18:27.769 --> 00:18:30.303
The Pilot of course
didn't approve of his probe.


262
00:18:30.305 --> 00:18:33.806
The trust was gone.
They parted ways.


263
00:18:33.808 --> 00:18:35.641
The Pilot began
to wipe the minds


264
00:18:35.643 --> 00:18:38.177
of all the original mortals.

265
00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:41.114
Helias became the only immortal,
other than the Pilot,


266
00:18:41.116 --> 00:18:43.249
to have memories
of mortal existence.


267
00:18:43.251 --> 00:18:45.118
The Pilot collected
and stored the information


268
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.686
in his data centre.

269
00:18:46.688 --> 00:18:48.921
Where is he now?

270
00:18:48.923 --> 00:18:51.157
The Pilot eventually had Helias
captured and rehabilitated.


271
00:18:51.159 --> 00:18:53.726
That's a nice way to say
they erased his mind.


272
00:18:53.728 --> 00:18:57.597
- Killed him without killing him.
- We all see it.


273
00:18:57.599 --> 00:18:58.798
What he showed us -

274
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.935
when you reduce Maintenance,
you begin to change.


275
00:19:02.937 --> 00:19:05.371
Maintenance contains
mood stabilisers.


276
00:19:05.373 --> 00:19:07.540
So you essentially become

277
00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:10.243
a muted version of the person
you're supposed to be.


278
00:19:10.245 --> 00:19:12.945
Which is why we want to alter
the Maintenance,


279
00:19:12.947 --> 00:19:14.180
lower its potency,

280
00:19:14.182 --> 00:19:16.549
so that everyone in Alisandre
can experience


281
00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:17.783
for a few moments

282
00:19:17.785 --> 00:19:21.454
a version of what real
human existence feels like.


283
00:19:21.456 --> 00:19:23.156
And then what?

284
00:19:23.158 --> 00:19:25.925
Well, removing the Maintenance
only gives us


285
00:19:25.927 --> 00:19:28.594
an edited version
of the human experience.


286
00:19:28.596 --> 00:19:32.165
None of us can really understand
what it feels like to be human


287
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:35.902
without the stakes
of human life.


288
00:19:35.904 --> 00:19:37.870
Without being mortal.

289
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:43.543
Are you talking about destroying
the Code itself?


290
00:19:46.948 --> 00:19:48.714
I remember you telling me

291
00:19:48.716 --> 00:19:52.418
that Helias's belief
in mortal religion was flawed.


292
00:19:53.254 --> 00:19:55.421
I didn't know you could still
remember that long ago.


293
00:19:55.423 --> 00:19:57.190
I thought we'd removed
that data.


294
00:19:57.192 --> 00:19:59.926
I remember you telling me
that mortals needed religion


295
00:19:59.928 --> 00:20:02.361
because they were afraid
of dying.


296
00:20:03.531 --> 00:20:06.933
But with immortal beings,
there is no fear of death


297
00:20:06.935 --> 00:20:09.402
and so no need for religion.

298
00:20:10.238 --> 00:20:12.171
Religious citizens talked about

299
00:20:12.173 --> 00:20:15.541
being alive
for a God-given purpose,


300
00:20:15.543 --> 00:20:19.045
that their time on Earth
was intentionally difficult,


301
00:20:19.047 --> 00:20:24.417
and that they were each given
a soul which was immortal.


302
00:20:25.486 --> 00:20:29.288
That was the logic
of primitive minds.


303
00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.258
Of course I always knew
that science and technology


304
00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.793
were the real gods.

305
00:20:33.795 --> 00:20:36.229
Their god never worked for
the greater good of the world.


306
00:20:36.231 --> 00:20:37.897
Mine always did.

307
00:20:37.899 --> 00:20:40.299
Humans... Um...

308
00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:44.670
The... the human condition
needed to evolve.


309
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.375
What about Helias?
What did he believe?


310
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:52.678
You're full of questions
tonight.


311
00:20:54.015 --> 00:20:56.482
Why don't we get back
to the game?


312
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.397
At the beginning,

313
00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:14.267
Helias was as secular
as they come.


314
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:17.870
When we were at Harvard,
he never mentioned religion.


315
00:21:17.872 --> 00:21:18.971
Ever.

316
00:21:18.973 --> 00:21:22.408
Well, he was a true scholar

317
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.711
and he believed that technology
would be the answer


318
00:21:25.713 --> 00:21:27.446
to human suffering.

319
00:21:27.448 --> 00:21:31.651
Many people started to move
toward that direction


320
00:21:31.653 --> 00:21:33.619
at that time.

321
00:21:34.622 --> 00:21:37.223
Helias started to believe
that the...


322
00:21:37.225 --> 00:21:40.993
..the human body is a machine.

323
00:21:40.995 --> 00:21:44.096
And he was right -
we started to work on this idea


324
00:21:44.098 --> 00:21:47.733
that this machine
could be perfected


325
00:21:47.735 --> 00:21:52.138
so that it could go on and on
forever.


326
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.940
Now, that was
an exciting time.


327
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.543
When we first started
our company


328
00:21:57.545 --> 00:21:59.512
and we...

329
00:21:59.514 --> 00:22:05.017
..we grew our group of
scientists and geneticists,


330
00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:06.452
we started to feel that

331
00:22:06.454 --> 00:22:09.588
we were really going
to be able to do it.


332
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.025
For the greater good, right?

333
00:22:15.129 --> 00:22:17.396
Of course.

334
00:22:40.688 --> 00:22:43.255
Wake up. Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?


335
00:22:43.257 --> 00:22:45.558
Can you hear me?
Wake up. Wake up.


336
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.128
Wake up. Wake up.
Can you hear me? Wake up.


337
00:23:33.508 --> 00:23:35.775
Where's your book?

338
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:38.911
I'm sorry?

339
00:23:38.913 --> 00:23:41.313
Your book. What was it?

340
00:23:43.184 --> 00:23:45.050
'Being and Nothingness'.

341
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.720
That was it.

342
00:23:48.589 --> 00:23:51.090
Too much on my mind to read.

343
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.093
I know the feeling.

344
00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:57.496
You do?

345
00:23:58.933 --> 00:24:00.599
I do.

346
00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:03.669
Who are you?

347
00:24:04.405 --> 00:24:06.705
My name is Akae.

348
00:24:06.707 --> 00:24:08.574
Logos.

349
00:24:09.677 --> 00:24:12.511
- Nice to meet you, Logos.
- Likewise.


350
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:16.916
Can I ask you something?

351
00:24:16.918 --> 00:24:18.951
You already have.

352
00:24:21.222 --> 00:24:23.422
That's true.

353
00:24:23.424 --> 00:24:26.125
But something a bit more...

354
00:24:26.127 --> 00:24:28.294
..personal.

355
00:24:28.296 --> 00:24:30.830
Depends on what you want to ask.

356
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:42.007
Do you take your Maintenance?

357
00:24:44.045 --> 00:24:45.478
Why would you ask that?

358
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.646
It just seems like you don't.

359
00:24:48.382 --> 00:24:50.082
Do you?

360
00:24:53.654 --> 00:24:56.822
Seems like a question
neither of us wants to answer.


361
00:24:58.092 --> 00:25:02.094
But I get the sense
we've got a lot in common.


362
00:25:07.935 --> 00:25:11.570
I need to understand
how you plan on doing this.


363
00:25:11.572 --> 00:25:13.739
You've figured out a way
to reduce the Maintenance,


364
00:25:13.741 --> 00:25:18.244
but getting access to the supply
is impossible.


365
00:25:18.246 --> 00:25:20.746
Difficult, yeah.

366
00:25:20.748 --> 00:25:23.983
But I wouldn't say impossible.

367
00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:26.552
Few things truly are,

368
00:25:26.554 --> 00:25:28.921
so long as you have faith.

369
00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:35.628
I scouted the facility
and used the fader


370
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.930
to scan for vulnerabilities
in the structure.


371
00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:40.099
As a terraforming engineer,
I'm sure you're well aware...


372
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:41.700
That there are no weaknesses.

373
00:25:41.702 --> 00:25:43.469
The construction materials
of the building


374
00:25:43.471 --> 00:25:45.070
were embedded with
synthetic composites


375
00:25:45.072 --> 00:25:47.239
that make getting in
from the outside impossible.


376
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:51.243
So, I used the fader to scan
the surrounding infrastructures.


377
00:25:51.245 --> 00:25:52.645
What did you find?

378
00:25:52.647 --> 00:25:54.246
All of the capital buildings
are connected


379
00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:55.881
by a sort of underground maze.

380
00:25:55.883 --> 00:25:58.784
Wouldn't it be just as difficult
to gain access to those tunnels?


381
00:25:58.786 --> 00:26:00.553
Yeah, unless you knew someone

382
00:26:00.555 --> 00:26:03.188
who worked in
one of the capital buildings.


383
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.257
In fact, as all of you know,

384
00:26:05.259 --> 00:26:09.061
Alisandre is currently
celebrating its 200th year


385
00:26:09.063 --> 00:26:11.263
living with
the gift of immortality


386
00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:13.265
that was given to us
by the Pilot.


387
00:26:13.267 --> 00:26:16.835
Speaking of which, follow me and
we'll head to Shem application


388
00:26:16.837 --> 00:26:19.271
so we can get a firsthand look.

389
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:27.813
Uh, I'll be back
in just one moment.


390
00:26:27.815 --> 00:26:31.884
Yum, Chasan will take you ahead.
I'll be back.


391
00:26:36.824 --> 00:26:38.891
Follow me.

392
00:26:40.728 --> 00:26:42.361
What are you doing here?

393
00:26:42.363 --> 00:26:43.862
The answer is yes.

394
00:26:43.864 --> 00:26:46.231
What are you talking about?

395
00:26:46.233 --> 00:26:49.201
You asked me on the train
if I took my Maintenance.


396
00:26:49.203 --> 00:26:51.170
I do.

397
00:26:51.172 --> 00:26:53.105
Do you?

398
00:26:55.209 --> 00:26:57.042
We saw Chasan leading the tour.

399
00:26:57.044 --> 00:26:59.178
Is everything OK?

400
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.613
Everything's fine.

401
00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:02.114
We were just wrapping up.

402
00:27:02.116 --> 00:27:05.084
I can't do this today.
Let's talk tomorrow.


403
00:27:05.086 --> 00:27:06.986
I'll be here.

404
00:27:13.494 --> 00:27:15.794
How does it feel?

405
00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:18.464
How does what feel?

406
00:27:18.466 --> 00:27:20.399
Being identical twins.

407
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:21.767
It's a very rare thing.

408
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:24.036
We've always felt extra special
because of that.


409
00:27:24.038 --> 00:27:27.940
It's a bond that few understand
and that we both cherish.


410
00:27:27.942 --> 00:27:30.509
Are you scared of losing that
someday?


411
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:32.544
Losing what?

412
00:27:32.546 --> 00:27:34.246
The bond you share.

413
00:27:35.683 --> 00:27:39.218
That's impossible.
We'll always be the same.


414
00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.536
Unless the Pilot decides that

415
00:27:41.538 --> 00:27:43.855
one of you is ready for your
confirmation before the other.


416
00:27:43.858 --> 00:27:46.458
He would never do that.

417
00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.094
Of course.

418
00:27:59.607 --> 00:28:03.642
What happened yesterday?
Why was he there?


419
00:28:03.644 --> 00:28:05.177
<i>He wanted to tell me</i>

420
00:28:05.179 --> 00:28:09.148
<i>he was on his Maintenance,
and asked if I was.</i>


421
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.883
And what did you say?

422
00:28:11.619 --> 00:28:14.186
Nothing. We were interrupted.

423
00:28:14.188 --> 00:28:15.821
<i>Anything else?</i>

424
00:28:15.823 --> 00:28:17.556
We agreed to speak later.

425
00:28:17.558 --> 00:28:19.491
Good.

426
00:28:20.528 --> 00:28:23.429
Hopefully you'll be able to
obtain more information then.


427
00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:28.067
Armaros...

428
00:28:28.903 --> 00:28:30.736
<i>..do you ever wonder
what it's like?</i>


429
00:28:33.407 --> 00:28:34.873
What are you talking about?

430
00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:37.409
To not be on your Maintenance.

431
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:38.944
It's just...

432
00:28:38.946 --> 00:28:43.615
The idea of opening up your mind
to its most uncontrolled state,


433
00:28:43.617 --> 00:28:46.151
I wonder how it feels.

434
00:28:47.188 --> 00:28:49.254
I don't ever wonder that.

435
00:28:49.256 --> 00:28:50.923
<i>And you shouldn't either.</i>

436
00:28:50.925 --> 00:28:53.692
<i>Akae, people who do not take
their Maintenance</i>


437
00:28:53.694 --> 00:28:57.362
<i>are broken, defective.</i>

438
00:28:57.364 --> 00:28:59.064
<i>They're disrespecting a gift</i>

439
00:28:59.066 --> 00:29:00.599
<i>that the Pilot
has given to them.</i>


440
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:06.371
Deciding themselves that somehow
they know more than he does.


441
00:29:07.641 --> 00:29:10.275
<i>They don't.</i>

442
00:29:10.277 --> 00:29:13.245
You're right. They don't.

443
00:29:14.014 --> 00:29:16.515
It was just a crazy thought
I had.


444
00:29:19.453 --> 00:29:22.121
I'm proud of you, Akae.

445
00:29:22.123 --> 00:29:26.325
You are serving Alisandre
and the Pilot well.


446
00:29:28.195 --> 00:29:29.762
Keep up the good work.

447
00:29:53.053 --> 00:29:55.154
I wasn't sure you'd be here.

448
00:29:55.156 --> 00:29:56.822
I wasn't either.

449
00:29:57.925 --> 00:30:01.794
So, why are you really here?

450
00:30:05.166 --> 00:30:07.800
There aren't many people
like us.


451
00:30:08.702 --> 00:30:10.235
What do you mean, like us?

452
00:30:10.237 --> 00:30:13.438
People that think
there's something more.


453
00:30:14.241 --> 00:30:16.942
That question
the world around them.


454
00:30:16.944 --> 00:30:20.245
The real reason I'm here is

455
00:30:20.247 --> 00:30:22.915
I have some friends
I think you should meet.


456
00:30:23.684 --> 00:30:25.117
Friends?

457
00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:27.586
People that think the way we do.

458
00:30:29.223 --> 00:30:31.089
But why?

459
00:30:33.928 --> 00:30:37.162
I think you'd be interested
in what they have to say.


460
00:30:38.032 --> 00:30:40.098
They can explain more.

461
00:30:42.336 --> 00:30:44.303
Why should I trust you?

462
00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:47.272
You shouldn't.

463
00:30:47.274 --> 00:30:49.308
You don't have to.

464
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.078
You could walk away right now
and never see me again.


465
00:30:56.984 --> 00:30:59.184
Or you could come with me.

466
00:31:11.799 --> 00:31:13.332
Welcome.

467
00:31:13.334 --> 00:31:14.466
Gergot.

468
00:31:14.468 --> 00:31:15.901
- Logos.
- Akae.


469
00:31:15.903 --> 00:31:18.303
I've been looking forward
to meeting you both.


470
00:31:18.305 --> 00:31:21.173
I wasn't here when you first met
the rest of the group.


471
00:31:21.175 --> 00:31:23.141
I was in the forested area.

472
00:31:23.143 --> 00:31:25.344
- Doing what?
- Foraging.


473
00:31:25.346 --> 00:31:26.778
Foraging?

474
00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.113
The Pilot's dietary inventions

475
00:31:28.115 --> 00:31:30.215
are complex in nutrients
and efficient to consume


476
00:31:30.217 --> 00:31:33.118
but they taste
absolutely horrible.


477
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.254
So I've self-trained as a chef.

478
00:31:35.256 --> 00:31:37.155
Obviously it's hard to get
my hands on ingredients


479
00:31:37.157 --> 00:31:40.459
that actually make food
taste good, so I improvise.


480
00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:42.261
Here we are.

481
00:31:45.499 --> 00:31:48.066
- You must be Akae.
- I am.


482
00:31:48.068 --> 00:31:50.402
We're very glad you're here.

483
00:31:51.438 --> 00:31:55.140
Helias believed that we have
an intended purpose on Earth.


484
00:31:55.142 --> 00:31:58.810
He believed to the core of his
being that we're meant to die.


485
00:31:58.812 --> 00:32:02.047
I feel like
I'm walking through my life


486
00:32:02.049 --> 00:32:04.583
as two totally different people.

487
00:32:05.352 --> 00:32:09.888
That there's a part of me
somewhere inside


488
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.990
that I can't quite access.

489
00:32:11.992 --> 00:32:14.159
That's exactly what
Helias thought.


490
00:32:14.161 --> 00:32:17.796
He believed there was a creator
of this universe and of man.


491
00:32:17.798 --> 00:32:20.933
He said that mortals believed
that they each had an essence -


492
00:32:20.935 --> 00:32:22.367
he called it the soul -

493
00:32:22.369 --> 00:32:25.837
which had a purpose given to it
by this creator.


494
00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:27.372
Instead, the Pilot decided

495
00:32:27.374 --> 00:32:30.375
to determine a purpose
for each one of us,


496
00:32:30.377 --> 00:32:33.078
essentially denying us
the right to our own destiny.


497
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.815
And while we still feel
emotions, they're limited.


498
00:32:36.817 --> 00:32:39.851
Mortals experienced more.

499
00:32:39.853 --> 00:32:41.486
Much more.

500
00:32:41.488 --> 00:32:43.488
What's the point?

501
00:32:44.625 --> 00:32:46.058
What do you mean?

502
00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.926
While what this man,
Helias, believed


503
00:32:47.928 --> 00:32:49.962
is certainly interesting,

504
00:32:49.964 --> 00:32:51.730
what's the point
in believing in a mortal life


505
00:32:51.732 --> 00:32:54.866
when it's not something
we're genetically capable of?


506
00:32:54.868 --> 00:32:57.169
It just seems futile to me.

507
00:32:58.839 --> 00:33:00.772
I hope she didn't offend you.

508
00:33:00.774 --> 00:33:04.309
No. No. She hasn't.

509
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:06.378
I like people
that ask big questions,


510
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.349
because big questions
are what we here are all about.


511
00:33:11.185 --> 00:33:15.053
I especially like questions
that I know the answer to.


512
00:33:23.263 --> 00:33:25.230
Helias called it
the Code Diffuser.


513
00:33:25.232 --> 00:33:29.167
It was intended to wipe the Code
from the genome.


514
00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:31.870
He created it as a way
to restore mortality.


515
00:33:31.872 --> 00:33:34.072
Why would he do that?

516
00:33:34.808 --> 00:33:39.011
He felt it was a very important
part of the human experience.


517
00:33:39.013 --> 00:33:40.846
Something we are all
missing out on.


518
00:33:40.848 --> 00:33:43.582
Has anyone ever used it before?

519
00:33:43.584 --> 00:33:45.183
He never finished work on it.

520
00:33:45.185 --> 00:33:47.986
This is just a prototype.

521
00:33:47.988 --> 00:33:51.623
We are planning on
restoring Helias's mind data.


522
00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:53.859
But in order to do that,
we need to find Helias.


523
00:33:53.861 --> 00:33:57.195
And when we do, we'll finally
meet the man behind all of this,


524
00:33:57.197 --> 00:33:59.031
finish what he started.

525
00:33:59.033 --> 00:34:00.732
Do all of you plan on using it?

526
00:34:00.734 --> 00:34:03.802
Our hope is eventually
everyone in Alisandre will.


527
00:34:03.804 --> 00:34:05.237
Why would they?

528
00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:08.840
Everyone believes
immortality is a gift.


529
00:34:08.842 --> 00:34:11.410
Do you?

530
00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.848
Everyone believes it's a gift,
as you say,


531
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.384
because the Maintenance
they're taking every single day


532
00:34:19.386 --> 00:34:21.319
makes them believe
that that's true.


533
00:34:22.756 --> 00:34:25.323
Which is why
we're hoping to alter


534
00:34:25.325 --> 00:34:27.092
a single batch
of the Maintenance


535
00:34:27.094 --> 00:34:29.361
to create a short-term effect.

536
00:34:31.031 --> 00:34:33.498
A temporary experience,
if you will.


537
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.435
A small window in time
in which members of this society


538
00:34:36.437 --> 00:34:39.271
might actually be able to
process what we're saying.


539
00:34:39.273 --> 00:34:43.175
Are there any long-term effects
or permanent damage?


540
00:34:43.177 --> 00:34:45.343
Certainly no damage.

541
00:34:45.345 --> 00:34:47.546
And as for long-term effects,

542
00:34:47.548 --> 00:34:49.347
that's the goal,

543
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:51.016
isn't it?

544
00:34:51.018 --> 00:34:53.618
The problem with the plan
is that they...


545
00:34:58.392 --> 00:35:04.262
..we don't have access
to the Maintenance supply.


546
00:35:04.264 --> 00:35:07.299
It's stored
in a very secure facility.


547
00:35:07.301 --> 00:35:10.435
A facility
adjacent to Nescience.


548
00:35:12.106 --> 00:35:14.072
That's why I'm here.

549
00:35:14.074 --> 00:35:15.807
Because of where I work.

550
00:35:28.655 --> 00:35:30.989
What did it feel like to you

551
00:35:30.991 --> 00:35:32.891
when I died?

552
00:35:35.529 --> 00:35:38.630
Why do you continue to ask
that question?


553
00:35:41.235 --> 00:35:42.968
Do you expect
a different answer?


554
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.303
Tell me again.

555
00:35:53.647 --> 00:35:56.281
Losing your mother
was more than I could bear.


556
00:35:57.017 --> 00:35:59.384
And then to lose you...

557
00:36:04.391 --> 00:36:09.427
There were days when the pain
was so overwhelming


558
00:36:09.429 --> 00:36:14.332
that I didn't think
I could carry on.


559
00:36:16.503 --> 00:36:19.137
You were close -

560
00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:22.140
so close to being able
to save me.


561
00:36:22.142 --> 00:36:24.376
After I lost you, I...

562
00:36:25.112 --> 00:36:28.280
..I made Helias
promise me that...


563
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:31.683
..that under no circumstances
would we leave the lab


564
00:36:31.685 --> 00:36:35.754
until we were certain
that we had it right.


565
00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:40.325
Until we knew for sure
that the Code,


566
00:36:40.327 --> 00:36:44.496
the genetic modifier
we had created,


567
00:36:44.498 --> 00:36:46.631
was the key to immortality.

568
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:51.703
And that's what we did.

569
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.906
But Helias left.

570
00:36:59.313 --> 00:37:02.113
He thought I took
too much of the credit,


571
00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:06.117
which was not my intention.

572
00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:11.289
But I was the driving force.

573
00:37:12.726 --> 00:37:16.461
That part of the story changes
every time you tell it.


574
00:37:19.066 --> 00:37:21.299
I found what the Pilot
is looking for.


575
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:25.237
The virus,
only it's not a virus.


576
00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:27.305
It's a Code Diffuser.

577
00:37:27.307 --> 00:37:30.709
It changes it in some way.
Reduces it.


578
00:37:30.711 --> 00:37:32.544
Changes the Code?

579
00:37:32.546 --> 00:37:37.716
I wanted to believe that
somehow the Pilot was wrong,


580
00:37:37.718 --> 00:37:39.417
that there weren't people
like this.


581
00:37:39.419 --> 00:37:41.386
The Pilot
is never wrong.


582
00:37:41.388 --> 00:37:43.688
Is there anything else?

583
00:37:44.992 --> 00:37:48.159
They want me to help them access
the Maintenance facility.


584
00:37:48.161 --> 00:37:50.262
What? Why?

585
00:37:50.264 --> 00:37:52.564
They want to alter
a batch of Maintenance.


586
00:37:52.566 --> 00:37:55.400
- For themselves?
- For everyone.


587
00:37:55.402 --> 00:37:57.969
They want to clear everyone
from what they believe to be


588
00:37:57.971 --> 00:38:03.108
some sort of mental fog
induced by Maintenance.


589
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.676
For what purpose?

590
00:38:04.678 --> 00:38:07.579
They want to tell everyone
about the diffuser,


591
00:38:07.581 --> 00:38:12.651
to convince everyone
that we should be mortal.


592
00:38:12.653 --> 00:38:14.619
Mortal.

593
00:38:15.822 --> 00:38:17.322
What did you tell them?

594
00:38:17.324 --> 00:38:19.524
I told them I couldn't do it.

595
00:38:19.526 --> 00:38:23.028
It's far too risky.
What if they succeed?


596
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:26.498
These poor
delusional individuals.


597
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.133
They're not on
their Maintenance.


598
00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:30.335
Their minds are unclear.

599
00:38:30.337 --> 00:38:33.805
Why would you ever want to
disrupt a perfect world?


600
00:38:36.576 --> 00:38:38.977
What is it
that brought you back to us?


601
00:38:39.913 --> 00:38:44.716
I'm here because I can help you
access the Maintenance facility.


602
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.853
Are you sure
you want to do that?


603
00:38:48.855 --> 00:38:52.757
It's not a mission
without grave risk.


604
00:38:52.759 --> 00:38:54.259
I'm sure.

605
00:38:56.396 --> 00:38:59.264
I told you there's no
surveillance in this area.


606
00:38:59.266 --> 00:39:01.533
No-one uses these walkways
anymore.


607
00:39:12.179 --> 00:39:14.045
- Why is it locked?
- I don't know.


608
00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:16.581
- The scanner's not working.
- I knew she wouldn't help us.


609
00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:18.983
That's not it.
This is an antiquated device.


610
00:39:18.985 --> 00:39:21.653
Alright, let's go.

611
00:39:21.655 --> 00:39:23.388
Let's go.

612
00:39:30.831 --> 00:39:33.531
- Which way?
- Let's stick to the exit plan.


613
00:39:33.533 --> 00:39:36.034
You guys go that way
and we'll go through Nescience.


614
00:39:44.945 --> 00:39:47.045
Hello, Logos.

615
00:39:50.784 --> 00:39:52.484
Akae.

616
00:39:54.521 --> 00:39:56.154
You should be proud.

617
00:39:56.156 --> 00:39:59.124
The Pilot is delighted with you.

618
00:40:00.961 --> 00:40:02.961
What?

619
00:40:02.963 --> 00:40:05.530
You're... you're a guardian?

620
00:40:06.933 --> 00:40:08.400
I...

621
00:40:10.604 --> 00:40:12.103
Akae.

622
00:40:12.105 --> 00:40:13.838
You lied to me.

623
00:40:17.677 --> 00:40:20.979
I could not tell you I was
a watcher and you know that.


624
00:40:31.925 --> 00:40:36.127
Akae, you have done an admirable
service for our society.


625
00:40:38.432 --> 00:40:40.698
Thank you.

626
00:40:41.468 --> 00:40:43.568
Do you have a question?

627
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.537
Something concerning you?

628
00:40:47.908 --> 00:40:49.574
I do.

629
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.444
When can I see Logos?

630
00:40:53.713 --> 00:40:55.580
I'm afraid
that's not possible.


631
00:40:55.582 --> 00:40:58.616
I lied to him for my own gain

632
00:40:58.618 --> 00:41:00.385
and I'd like to apologise.

633
00:41:00.387 --> 00:41:03.588
Well, that's a lovely gesture,
Akae,


634
00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.825
but the Logos you knew is gone.

635
00:41:08.061 --> 00:41:09.894
In order to rehabilitate him,

636
00:41:09.896 --> 00:41:15.533
to free him from his unnatural
desire for mortality,


637
00:41:15.535 --> 00:41:18.636
we had to erase his mind,
his memories,


638
00:41:18.638 --> 00:41:21.005
everything that made him
who he was.


639
00:41:21.908 --> 00:41:24.342
It's for the better,
I assure you.


640
00:41:25.078 --> 00:41:28.513
You should feel a great sense of
pride for the work you've done.


641
00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:34.719
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?


642
00:41:34.721 --> 00:41:36.020
No.

643
00:41:37.157 --> 00:41:38.590
Thank you.

644
00:41:38.592 --> 00:41:40.925
There is one thing.

645
00:41:42.729 --> 00:41:45.096
I'd like to remain at Nescience.

646
00:41:45.098 --> 00:41:48.399
A guardian office awaits you
at the capital.


647
00:41:48.401 --> 00:41:50.401
It's where I feel comfortable.

648
00:41:50.403 --> 00:41:52.670
Then that's where you'll stay.

649
00:42:44.357 --> 00:42:46.090
He's in Daden.

650
00:44:07.374 --> 00:44:09.173
Excuse me.

651
00:44:49.015 --> 00:44:51.949
It's me, Akae.

652
00:44:54.454 --> 00:44:56.721
I came to apologise.

653
00:44:56.723 --> 00:44:58.756
I'm the reason you're here.

654
00:44:58.758 --> 00:45:01.059
I'm the reason you've changed.

655
00:45:03.229 --> 00:45:06.230
If I knew what they were going
to do, I never would've.


656
00:45:08.968 --> 00:45:11.169
I need you to come with me.

657
00:45:15.575 --> 00:45:18.676
I'm sorry. I really am.

658
00:45:18.678 --> 00:45:21.312
But I don't know who you are.

659
00:45:36.463 --> 00:45:39.363
Hello? Hello!

660
00:45:42.669 --> 00:45:46.437
<i>I can't hear you. Logos?</i>

661
00:45:46.439 --> 00:45:49.507
No, it's me, Akae.

662
00:45:54.881 --> 00:45:57.315
She said she knows where Logos
is but needs our help.


663
00:45:57.317 --> 00:46:00.585
After what she did?

664
00:46:00.587 --> 00:46:02.487
I agree with Psuker.
It's not worth the risk.


665
00:46:02.489 --> 00:46:07.258
Not to mention we have no way of
knowing if her story is true.


666
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.659
It could be a trap.

667
00:46:08.661 --> 00:46:10.228
She seemed sincere.

668
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.898
Yeah, she did
when she was here before too.


669
00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:30.047
<i>- Akae?
- Yes.</i>


670
00:46:30.817 --> 00:46:34.218
<i>We can't help you. 
I'm sorry.</i>

671
00:46:36.289 --> 00:46:38.489
But... Please.

672
00:47:16.629 --> 00:47:19.997
People used to
openly worship here.


673
00:47:22.769 --> 00:47:25.536
A belief system
based entirely upon faith.


674
00:47:29.976 --> 00:47:32.643
Medorin told you
we can't help you.


675
00:47:36.983 --> 00:47:39.116
So why are you here?

676
00:47:43.122 --> 00:47:46.524
I understand
why you don't trust me.


677
00:47:48.728 --> 00:47:51.295
I thought people like you
were bad.


678
00:47:52.565 --> 00:47:54.565
I thought you were broken.

679
00:47:55.301 --> 00:47:58.069
Searching for a truth
that doesn't exist.


680
00:47:58.071 --> 00:48:00.538
I thought Logos was doing
the same.


681
00:48:03.343 --> 00:48:05.610
It all seemed wrong.

682
00:48:08.748 --> 00:48:12.416
I came face to face with
what scared me the most.


683
00:48:12.418 --> 00:48:13.885
Believing in something

684
00:48:13.887 --> 00:48:17.221
so different to
the world I've known.


685
00:48:20.326 --> 00:48:24.595
I felt that way because that's
how the Pilot wanted me to feel.


686
00:48:28.301 --> 00:48:31.202
After I stopped taking
my Maintenance...


687
00:48:32.071 --> 00:48:35.106
..I realised
you're far from broken.


688
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:39.076
And the truth you're
searching for does exist.


689
00:48:39.078 --> 00:48:41.379
You stopped taking
your Maintenance?


690
00:48:42.849 --> 00:48:44.582
Completely.

691
00:48:45.985 --> 00:48:48.452
You still haven't answered
my question.


692
00:48:51.658 --> 00:48:53.724
I found Logos.

693
00:48:53.726 --> 00:48:56.260
He's in Daden.

694
00:48:56.262 --> 00:48:59.230
His mind has been wiped
and he needs to be restored.


695
00:48:59.232 --> 00:49:03.034
We need to save him
and you're going to help me.


696
00:49:04.304 --> 00:49:06.570
Why won't you
tell me the real reason


697
00:49:06.572 --> 00:49:08.606
Helias left you and the machine?

698
00:49:08.608 --> 00:49:11.108
He was jealous.

699
00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.711
You know about mortal jealousy.

700
00:49:13.713 --> 00:49:16.047
For him to turn so quickly
on you,


701
00:49:16.049 --> 00:49:17.982
he must have had a reason.

702
00:49:18.751 --> 00:49:21.052
It was nothing of the sort.

703
00:49:27.026 --> 00:49:29.961
It's Logos. He's gone.

704
00:49:36.703 --> 00:49:39.103
Gone?

705
00:49:40.273 --> 00:49:42.239
What do you mean gone?
Gone where?


706
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.753
He didn't report to his office.

707
00:49:55.755 --> 00:49:58.456
His data is gone too.

708
00:49:58.458 --> 00:50:02.093
Akae must have downloaded it
directly.


709
00:50:10.503 --> 00:50:12.470
Find them!

710
00:50:17.243 --> 00:50:21.145
Everything's going to be OK.
I promise.


711
00:50:22.248 --> 00:50:25.383
I know what it's like to feel
really unsure about something.


712
00:50:26.619 --> 00:50:28.352
What do you mean?

713
00:50:29.822 --> 00:50:32.523
I grew up in a world
that was perfect.


714
00:50:32.525 --> 00:50:34.759
Made for me by the Pilot.

715
00:50:34.761 --> 00:50:36.494
For all of us.

716
00:50:39.098 --> 00:50:41.265
That's what I thought at least.

717
00:50:41.267 --> 00:50:45.369
But there were these...
questions,


718
00:50:45.371 --> 00:50:48.372
these thoughts I kept having.

719
00:50:48.374 --> 00:50:51.275
Like maybe there was
something more


720
00:50:51.277 --> 00:50:53.644
underneath all the perfection.

721
00:50:54.981 --> 00:50:57.648
But I was wrong
for having those thoughts.


722
00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:00.418
I was wrong to question
the life I was given.


723
00:51:01.354 --> 00:51:04.121
But those same questions
are coming back


724
00:51:04.123 --> 00:51:08.392
and it's seemingly impossible
to push them away.


725
00:51:11.697 --> 00:51:14.265
Why are you saying this?

726
00:51:16.636 --> 00:51:18.736
Because you're not going to
remember any of it


727
00:51:18.738 --> 00:51:20.104
in a few minutes.

728
00:51:20.106 --> 00:51:22.339
We're going to bring you back.

729
00:51:25.211 --> 00:51:26.944
There was nothing in Akae's data

730
00:51:26.946 --> 00:51:28.779
that indicated
this should've happened.


731
00:51:28.781 --> 00:51:32.049
Perhaps her data was inaccurate.

732
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:34.351
Her scan showed normal levels
of Maintenance.


733
00:51:34.353 --> 00:51:38.022
I trusted you. 
I shouldn't have.

734
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.593
Logos?

735
00:51:44.297 --> 00:51:45.763
Logos?

736
00:51:47.733 --> 00:51:49.333
Logos!

737
00:51:52.004 --> 00:51:54.138
It was surreal -

738
00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:57.808
you were you but you weren't.

739
00:52:00.046 --> 00:52:02.413
You had no idea who I was.

740
00:52:03.149 --> 00:52:05.416
No idea who you were.

741
00:52:07.854 --> 00:52:09.620
I'm glad you're back.

742
00:52:10.556 --> 00:52:12.556
I'm glad to be back.

743
00:52:18.598 --> 00:52:20.030
Sonitas has a plan -

744
00:52:20.032 --> 00:52:21.832
a way to show the world
who we are.


745
00:52:21.834 --> 00:52:25.136
The Pilot's global address will
be broadcast in just a few days.


746
00:52:25.138 --> 00:52:26.670
I've found a way
to hack into it.


747
00:52:26.672 --> 00:52:29.773
This will allow us to replace
the Pilot's feed with our own.


748
00:52:29.775 --> 00:52:32.476
Of course, before we do this,
we need to alter the Maintenance


749
00:52:32.478 --> 00:52:34.211
to make sure
our message is heard.


750
00:52:34.213 --> 00:52:37.515
Which didn't go so well
last time.


751
00:52:40.086 --> 00:52:41.886
I have a plan.

752
00:52:43.489 --> 00:52:45.089
And here is a brief explanation

753
00:52:45.091 --> 00:52:48.025
about how our colony began
exactly 200 years ago.


754
00:52:48.027 --> 00:52:50.027
- That was really good.
- OK, now you try.


755
00:52:50.029 --> 00:52:53.230
And here is a brief explanation
about how our colony began...


756
00:52:55.568 --> 00:52:58.369
I can't talk long
but I need your help.


757
00:53:21.994 --> 00:53:23.427
Thank you.

758
00:53:23.429 --> 00:53:26.096
I promise it'll make sense
why I've asked you to do this.


759
00:53:26.098 --> 00:53:28.899
We trust you, Akae.

760
00:53:49.055 --> 00:53:50.955
Why don't you do the honours?

761
00:54:30.896 --> 00:54:33.430
It works. Let's go.

762
00:54:53.019 --> 00:54:54.852
I just heard
from Masim.


763
00:54:54.854 --> 00:54:57.087
They should be here
the day after tomorrow.


764
00:54:57.089 --> 00:54:59.323
- Have they heard from Gergot?
- Not yet.


765
00:54:59.325 --> 00:55:02.059
I'm sure he's just out
gathering supplies.


766
00:55:14.674 --> 00:55:18.642
<i>"In anguish, I apprehend
myself at once as totally free</i>


767
00:55:18.644 --> 00:55:21.378
<i>"and as not being able to derive
the meaning of the world</i>


768
00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.315
<i>"except as coming from myself.</i>

769
00:55:24.317 --> 00:55:26.283
<i>"The recruit who reports
for active duty</i>


770
00:55:26.285 --> 00:55:27.651
<i>"at the beginning of the war</i>

771
00:55:27.653 --> 00:55:30.821
<i>"can in some instances
be afraid of death,</i>


772
00:55:30.823 --> 00:55:34.725
<i>"but more often
he is afraid of being afraid."</i>


773
00:55:42.868 --> 00:55:44.601
I'm sorry. I...

774
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:50.741
Is it Gergot?

775
00:55:54.447 --> 00:55:57.381
Taken by the watchers
and wiped clean.


776
00:55:59.685 --> 00:56:01.985
I'm sorry.

777
00:56:01.987 --> 00:56:03.754
Me too.

778
00:56:04.957 --> 00:56:10.928
You know, sometimes I wonder if
the Pilot didn't have it right,


779
00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:13.130
with the pain of loss.

780
00:56:15.735 --> 00:56:17.234
We can find him.

781
00:56:17.236 --> 00:56:18.769
Restore him, like I was.

782
00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:22.373
With the Pilot aware of us
and what we've been up to...


783
00:56:23.242 --> 00:56:24.975
..I hope so.

784
00:56:28.381 --> 00:56:31.582
I'll be just across the way
if you need anything.


785
00:56:36.389 --> 00:56:38.122
Thank you, Logos.

786
00:56:43.229 --> 00:56:45.796
I couldn't risk
leaving it behind.


787
00:57:03.482 --> 00:57:05.582
The altered Maintenance
is being distributed.


788
00:57:05.584 --> 00:57:08.552
Tomorrow an entire society
will be waking up


789
00:57:08.554 --> 00:57:10.521
with a new lens on the world.

790
00:57:10.523 --> 00:57:12.890
Our time to speak out is here.

791
00:57:12.892 --> 00:57:14.491
Once we've breached
the Pilot's address,


792
00:57:14.493 --> 00:57:18.562
our faces, our beliefs
will be made known to the world.


793
00:57:18.564 --> 00:57:21.532
We won't get another chance.
This is it.


794
00:57:21.534 --> 00:57:24.134
We need to make sure our voices
are heard and heard well.


795
00:57:24.136 --> 00:57:25.869
What if it worked?

796
00:57:27.373 --> 00:57:29.339
What do you mean?

797
00:57:29.341 --> 00:57:31.241
The Code Diffuser.
What if it worked?


798
00:57:31.243 --> 00:57:34.211
It's a prototype.

799
00:57:34.213 --> 00:57:35.646
Without Helias's mind data,

800
00:57:35.648 --> 00:57:38.315
we have no idea of knowing
how effective it would be.


801
00:57:38.317 --> 00:57:40.617
But if it were to work on me?

802
00:57:41.554 --> 00:57:45.155
Then you'd be the first
mortal citizen on this planet


803
00:57:45.157 --> 00:57:47.224
in over a century.

804
00:58:23.295 --> 00:58:25.496
Hey.

805
00:58:27.867 --> 00:58:29.900
Did you mean it?

806
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.669
Yeah.

807
00:58:37.343 --> 00:58:38.809
Akae, I...

808
00:58:38.811 --> 00:58:40.544
It's fine.

809
00:58:41.514 --> 00:58:43.680
If you want to die,

810
00:58:43.682 --> 00:58:45.949
it's your prerogative.

811
00:58:47.753 --> 00:58:49.953
It's not that I want to die.

812
00:58:51.056 --> 00:58:52.456
No?

813
00:58:52.458 --> 00:58:54.191
Then what is it?

814
00:58:55.227 --> 00:58:57.794
I want to live.

815
00:58:59.331 --> 00:59:02.533
I want to not know
what day is my last.


816
00:59:02.535 --> 00:59:06.270
To make decisions
with consequences.


817
00:59:08.173 --> 00:59:10.674
Real consequences.

818
00:59:12.945 --> 00:59:18.582
I want to know what it's like
to feel everything.


819
00:59:22.321 --> 00:59:25.022
And I can't do that like this.

820
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:31.862
I can't do that if I know
that I'm going to live forever.


821
00:59:58.090 --> 01:00:01.992
Logos! Wake up!

822
01:00:01.994 --> 01:00:05.596
Logos, wake up. Wake up!

823
01:00:05.598 --> 01:00:08.765
Medorin! Medorin!

824
01:00:08.767 --> 01:00:11.368
What's wrong with him?

825
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:13.170
He used the diffuser.

826
01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:15.238
Logos.

827
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.573
What can I do?

828
01:00:16.575 --> 01:00:19.309
If we don't stabilise him,
we might lose him.


829
01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:20.944
Logos.

830
01:00:20.946 --> 01:00:23.513
Logos, wake up.

831
01:00:23.515 --> 01:00:25.649
Do something, please.

832
01:00:28.621 --> 01:00:32.356
Logos.
Wake up. Listen to me.


833
01:00:32.358 --> 01:00:34.358
Listen.

834
01:01:01.053 --> 01:01:04.287
His body's still in shock
but he's stable.


835
01:01:05.224 --> 01:01:06.390
He'll need a few days

836
01:01:06.392 --> 01:01:08.692
before he can handle
another change to his genome.


837
01:01:08.694 --> 01:01:11.762
Then we can attempt at
reapplying the Code.


838
01:01:16.802 --> 01:01:19.136
His data was never scanned
and saved,


839
01:01:19.138 --> 01:01:23.874
so who knows if his memories
remain intact.


840
01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:27.277
This is uncharted territory.

841
01:02:34.179 --> 01:02:35.378
Logos.

842
01:02:45.424 --> 01:02:47.357
He's stable.

843
01:02:49.862 --> 01:02:52.062
I'll let you two talk.

844
01:02:52.064 --> 01:02:53.830
Hey.

845
01:02:56.201 --> 01:02:57.634
I'm sorry.

846
01:02:57.636 --> 01:02:59.402
I didn't mean to hurt you.

847
01:02:59.404 --> 01:03:00.771
It's OK.

848
01:03:00.773 --> 01:03:03.073
How do you feel?

849
01:03:03.075 --> 01:03:05.108
Different.

850
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.914
Different how?

851
01:03:12.851 --> 01:03:15.552
Everything is just...

852
01:03:16.588 --> 01:03:18.388
..clear.

853
01:03:19.625 --> 01:03:21.825
Do you like what you see?

854
01:03:23.328 --> 01:03:25.128
I do.

855
01:03:33.205 --> 01:03:34.971
Me too.

856
01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:40.043
At first, I...

857
01:03:41.313 --> 01:03:43.914
..I came to Daden,

858
01:03:43.916 --> 01:03:47.417
I had to get through
to you and...


859
01:03:47.419 --> 01:03:49.019
And what?

860
01:03:52.224 --> 01:03:53.990
I kissed you.

861
01:03:55.627 --> 01:03:57.994
I don't know why.

862
01:03:57.996 --> 01:04:01.097
A feeling just came over me.

863
01:04:03.135 --> 01:04:05.936
A feeling
I've never felt before.


864
01:04:08.473 --> 01:04:10.340
I just thought you should know.

865
01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:14.978
I'm glad you told me.

866
01:04:35.367 --> 01:04:37.400
Sonitas is almost in.

867
01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.441
Are you sure
you want to do this?


868
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:48.511
Because once you do,

869
01:04:48.513 --> 01:04:50.780
once you put yourself out there,

870
01:04:50.782 --> 01:04:53.483
explaining what you've done,

871
01:04:53.485 --> 01:04:55.218
there's no going back.

872
01:04:56.054 --> 01:04:58.855
And there's no telling
what could happen.


873
01:04:58.857 --> 01:05:00.924
I have to.

874
01:05:05.197 --> 01:05:07.097
Then I'll be right by your side.

875
01:05:13.839 --> 01:05:16.273
<i>Citizens.</i>

876
01:05:16.275 --> 01:05:18.341
<i>It is with gratitude
and humility</i>


877
01:05:18.343 --> 01:05:20.343
<i>that I come to you today
to talk,</i>


878
01:05:20.345 --> 01:05:23.046
<i>as we always do,
about our society.</i>


879
01:05:27.286 --> 01:05:30.320
<i>I know you were expecting to be
addressed by the Pilot.</i>


880
01:05:31.423 --> 01:05:35.659
<i>But please, hear me out.</i>

881
01:05:37.362 --> 01:05:39.095
My name is Logos.

882
01:05:39.097 --> 01:05:43.366
<i>I've been a citizen living
amongst you my entire life.</i>


883
01:05:43.368 --> 01:05:44.801
What's going on?!

884
01:05:44.803 --> 01:05:47.103
<i>And recently,
I've wondered</i>


885
01:05:47.105 --> 01:05:49.906
<i>what my purpose was
on this planet.</i>


886
01:05:49.908 --> 01:05:53.009
<i>I started asking myself
questions,</i>


887
01:05:53.011 --> 01:05:56.046
<i>questions about how we live.</i>

888
01:05:56.048 --> 01:05:59.182
<i>And I started to find answers.</i>

889
01:06:00.118 --> 01:06:02.986
I am no longer
under control of the Pilot.


890
01:06:02.988 --> 01:06:06.056
I am no longer imprisoned
by the Code.


891
01:06:06.058 --> 01:06:07.991
<i>I've diffused it.</i>

892
01:06:07.993 --> 01:06:10.293
<i>Freed myself from its reins.</i>

893
01:06:10.295 --> 01:06:15.732
<i>The Pilot created you to be
who he wants you to be,</i>


894
01:06:15.734 --> 01:06:18.368
<i>to live as he wants you to live.</i>

895
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:20.270
Now that my eyes
have been opened,


896
01:06:20.272 --> 01:06:24.374
I realised how much darkness
has been hiding underneath.


897
01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:27.877
<i>The Pilot made you...</i>

898
01:06:27.879 --> 01:06:32.415
<i>..designed you to be hollow...</i>

899
01:06:33.585 --> 01:06:35.318
<i>..to be empty inside,</i>

900
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.889
to never see the beauty of life
that I now see.


901
01:06:39.891 --> 01:06:42.092
Listen to me, all of you!

902
01:06:42.094 --> 01:06:45.895
I am mortal and I am alive!

903
01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:11.888
What are you reading?

904
01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:13.957
'A Tale of Two Cities'.

905
01:07:13.959 --> 01:07:16.026
I read that.

906
01:07:17.529 --> 01:07:19.696
I was wondering...

907
01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.066
Go on.

908
01:07:23.802 --> 01:07:27.570
Why do you think there is even
one citizen who is unhappy?


909
01:07:27.572 --> 01:07:30.273
It doesn't make sense based on
everything you've told me.


910
01:07:30.275 --> 01:07:34.377
There were always people
who were anomalies.


911
01:07:34.379 --> 01:07:37.180
Science tells us that
that would happen.


912
01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:41.084
In time, we, um... rehabilitated
these defectives


913
01:07:41.086 --> 01:07:44.454
and gave them
entirely new mind data.


914
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:47.357
They became new people.

915
01:07:48.293 --> 01:07:52.195
What about Logos?
Was he an anomaly?


916
01:07:53.198 --> 01:07:58.701
Logos has a natural immunity
to Maintenance.


917
01:07:58.703 --> 01:08:01.137
It is a, uh, rare occurrence

918
01:08:01.139 --> 01:08:03.740
but still possible.

919
01:08:05.644 --> 01:08:09.212
So you basically program
citizens to be content?


920
01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:12.816
Perhaps a little history lesson
is in order.


921
01:08:13.552 --> 01:08:15.985
Would you like to know what
the human condition was like


922
01:08:15.987 --> 01:08:17.353
before the Code?

923
01:08:17.355 --> 01:08:19.122
You've told me the history
many times.


924
01:08:19.124 --> 01:08:21.024
I told you
what I wanted you to know


925
01:08:21.026 --> 01:08:22.759
and I never even gave you
the data.


926
01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:25.662
There is... there's much more.

927
01:08:27.933 --> 01:08:30.033
Mortal life

928
01:08:30.035 --> 01:08:34.170
was filled with
pure, hideous suffering.


929
01:08:35.006 --> 01:08:38.975
War, disease, poverty,

930
01:08:38.977 --> 01:08:42.879
crime, hate, starvation,

931
01:08:42.881 --> 01:08:45.882
discrimination, evil.

932
01:08:47.385 --> 01:08:50.920
World leaders were more
concerned with wealth and power


933
01:08:50.922 --> 01:08:52.755
than with their own people.

934
01:08:54.426 --> 01:08:57.327
I was just a geneticist
in a lab,


935
01:08:57.329 --> 01:08:59.329
but I saw something
in my own work


936
01:08:59.331 --> 01:09:00.864
that others failed to see.

937
01:09:00.866 --> 01:09:02.599
Would you like to know
what that was?


938
01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:06.302
I saw possibilities.

939
01:09:08.006 --> 01:09:10.006
Hope.

940
01:09:10.008 --> 01:09:12.575
I saw a changed society.

941
01:09:13.378 --> 01:09:16.980
I knew that if I applied
my research,


942
01:09:16.982 --> 01:09:20.083
I could solve
the world's problems.


943
01:09:20.085 --> 01:09:21.818
What about free will?

944
01:09:22.621 --> 01:09:26.723
Free will is responsible
for every grain of suffering


945
01:09:26.725 --> 01:09:28.758
in human history.

946
01:09:30.061 --> 01:09:33.630
I watched many people die.

947
01:09:33.632 --> 01:09:35.498
People I cared about.

948
01:09:37.769 --> 01:09:39.202
And I saved everyone.

949
01:09:39.204 --> 01:09:43.506
I saved everyone else
from experiencing that pain.


950
01:09:50.682 --> 01:09:52.715
Look at me.

951
01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.821
Death is nothing more
than a looming black hole.


952
01:10:00.825 --> 01:10:04.861
There is no other existence

953
01:10:04.863 --> 01:10:07.764
on some other plane.

954
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.201
No god, no angels.

955
01:10:12.804 --> 01:10:15.605
It's a fairytale, Amanda.

956
01:10:15.607 --> 01:10:17.473
It's fantasy.

957
01:10:17.475 --> 01:10:21.945
I created heaven in Alisandre.

958
01:10:21.947 --> 01:10:24.380
Right here, right now.

959
01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:33.957
Why should there ever be
all that suffering?


960
01:10:35.727 --> 01:10:38.761
Why would Logos want to be
responsible for this?


961
01:10:43.635 --> 01:10:45.435
I created him.

962
01:10:46.771 --> 01:10:50.807
I gave him life,

963
01:10:50.809 --> 01:10:52.475
safety,

964
01:10:52.477 --> 01:10:57.313
a... a place away from fear
and uncertainty.


965
01:10:57.315 --> 01:11:00.416
They all are right here with me.

966
01:11:09.728 --> 01:11:13.396
I am going to save you
from yourself, Logos.


967
01:11:13.398 --> 01:11:17.834
<i>You are not living.
You are existing.</i>


968
01:11:17.836 --> 01:11:20.136
<i>You are bound by chains.</i>

969
01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:22.839
<i>Should this life be so still?</i>

970
01:11:22.841 --> 01:11:24.941
<i>So static?</i>

971
01:11:24.943 --> 01:11:27.910
<i>What if you were given
the urgency of knowing</i>


972
01:11:27.912 --> 01:11:31.014
<i>that you could never repeat
yesterday again?</i>


973
01:11:31.016 --> 01:11:33.716
That is being alive.

974
01:11:33.718 --> 01:11:35.318
And that is beautiful.

975
01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.720
Alright, I'm here. What is it?

976
01:11:37.722 --> 01:11:40.556
We need to act now.

977
01:11:41.293 --> 01:11:42.692
Your worry is not warranted.

978
01:11:42.694 --> 01:11:44.627
Do you not see
what is happening?


979
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:47.130
A natural immunity
to Maintenance


980
01:11:47.132 --> 01:11:49.065
was bound to happen.

981
01:11:49.067 --> 01:11:50.466
I could not prevent it.

982
01:11:50.468 --> 01:11:53.069
If he actually is different,

983
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:56.472
isn't that more reason
to be concerned?


984
01:11:57.609 --> 01:12:01.177
<i>We all live by blind faith
in a man.</i>


985
01:12:01.179 --> 01:12:03.246
<i>But is he as wise
as we believe him to be?</i>


986
01:12:03.248 --> 01:12:07.850
<i>By handing over our liberty to
him, are we not subject to him?</i>


987
01:12:07.852 --> 01:12:10.286
<i>Are we not slaves?</i>

988
01:12:10.288 --> 01:12:11.688
<i>Now that I am free from him,</i>

989
01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:14.090
<i>I see the world
as it should be seen.</i>


990
01:12:14.092 --> 01:12:18.961
Despite our watchers' vigilance,
their movement is growing.


991
01:12:18.963 --> 01:12:21.731
Citizens are experimenting
with reduced Maintenance,


992
01:12:21.733 --> 01:12:24.934
displaying signs of irrational
thought and behaviour.


993
01:12:26.104 --> 01:12:27.870
I see what you see.

994
01:12:27.872 --> 01:12:30.506
Sir, we are losing control!

995
01:12:30.508 --> 01:12:33.609
<i>WE are not losing anything.</i>

996
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.047
<i>Everything will be
as it should be.</i>


997
01:12:38.049 --> 01:12:39.949
And what about Logos?

998
01:12:39.951 --> 01:12:41.417
He is openly upturning

999
01:12:41.419 --> 01:12:43.886
everything that
you have created.


1000
01:12:43.888 --> 01:12:47.090
<i>I will deal with
Logos when the time is right.</i>


1001
01:12:48.493 --> 01:12:50.927
You're not concerned
in the least?


1002
01:12:53.365 --> 01:12:55.932
Logos has no idea
what he's doing.


1003
01:12:56.868 --> 01:12:58.968
He's going to die.

1004
01:13:01.272 --> 01:13:02.872
Perhaps.

1005
01:13:02.874 --> 01:13:05.174
But who knows
what will actually happen?


1006
01:13:05.176 --> 01:13:07.777
The diffuser is a prototype.

1007
01:13:09.314 --> 01:13:11.881
It will take much more
to discover


1008
01:13:11.883 --> 01:13:15.918
how to actually separate
the Code from the genome.


1009
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.788
There's only one other
who could actually do that.


1010
01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:22.859
Helias.

1011
01:13:26.598 --> 01:13:28.664
So they would need you.

1012
01:13:40.211 --> 01:13:42.178
Helias was naive.

1013
01:13:43.748 --> 01:13:45.581
Hopeful.

1014
01:13:46.985 --> 01:13:51.020
He didn't appreciate
what my design became.


1015
01:13:53.057 --> 01:13:56.626
I had to sacrifice him
for the greater good.


1016
01:13:58.196 --> 01:14:02.465
It was quite simple actually
to separate his data from mine.


1017
01:14:02.467 --> 01:14:05.935
We'd become
two clearly different thinkers.


1018
01:14:05.937 --> 01:14:09.839
You did this
after he created the diffuser.


1019
01:14:12.043 --> 01:14:14.043
He went rogue.

1020
01:14:15.046 --> 01:14:20.450
Overnight, it seemed he reverted
back to being a... primitive.


1021
01:14:23.421 --> 01:14:25.621
He was difficult to control.

1022
01:14:26.491 --> 01:14:29.592
He started spreading
subversive information


1023
01:14:29.594 --> 01:14:32.595
and then came his efforts

1024
01:14:32.597 --> 01:14:35.465
to undermine the Code.

1025
01:14:39.237 --> 01:14:42.638
But... you won.

1026
01:14:47.445 --> 01:14:51.681
His data is in my control

1027
01:14:51.683 --> 01:14:54.617
and entirely useless
to anyone but me.


1028
01:14:55.353 --> 01:15:00.723
The only human genome which
could accept it would be mine.


1029
01:15:03.228 --> 01:15:06.496
So, yes, I did win.

1030
01:15:06.498 --> 01:15:09.098
It's one thing
to see beauty


1031
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.602
but it's another to feel
a connection to it.


1032
01:15:14.439 --> 01:15:16.405
To feel it run through you.

1033
01:15:19.878 --> 01:15:21.611
What's wrong?

1034
01:15:25.783 --> 01:15:27.517
I'm scared.

1035
01:15:28.253 --> 01:15:30.019
Of what?

1036
01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:34.190
What if there's nothing?

1037
01:15:38.129 --> 01:15:42.532
What if when we die,
we just cease to exist?


1038
01:15:51.643 --> 01:15:54.844
What if the Pilot knows that
and he's right?


1039
01:16:00.184 --> 01:16:02.084
You're not wrong.

1040
01:16:10.528 --> 01:16:11.827
<i>He's not wrong.</i>

1041
01:16:11.829 --> 01:16:14.697
<i>And I now know
I can show that to Logos,</i>


1042
01:16:14.699 --> 01:16:16.866
<i>to everyone in Alisandre.</i>

1043
01:16:19.137 --> 01:16:21.370
<i>Citizens.</i>

1044
01:16:21.372 --> 01:16:25.641
<i>In the end,
all we have is faith.</i>


1045
01:16:29.847 --> 01:16:31.647
<i>Follow us.</i>

1046
01:16:32.684 --> 01:16:34.317
I've got you.

1047
01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:18.260
Amanda?

1048
01:17:34.212 --> 01:17:36.078
<i>I'm Amanda.</i>

1049
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:39.115
<i>That's how she started.</i>

1050
01:17:39.851 --> 01:17:41.751
<i>But what she should have said</i>

1051
01:17:41.753 --> 01:17:44.220
<i>that would have been
more accurate in that moment,</i>


1052
01:17:44.222 --> 01:17:47.823
<i>as she addressed the citizens
of Alisandre, is...</i>


1053
01:17:50.261 --> 01:17:52.762
<i>.."I am Helias."</i>

1054
01:17:54.632 --> 01:17:57.199
<i>I told Logos the news.</i>

1055
01:17:58.403 --> 01:18:00.603
<i>Helias is alive.</i>

1056
01:18:00.605 --> 01:18:03.239
<i>Well, his data at least.</i>

1057
01:18:03.241 --> 01:18:06.876
<i>Amanda, the Pilot's sacred
artificial creation,</i>


1058
01:18:06.878 --> 01:18:10.212
<i>downloaded Helias's data
onto her system.</i>


1059
01:18:10.214 --> 01:18:11.647
<i>All of it -</i>

1060
01:18:11.649 --> 01:18:15.818
<i>Helias's thoughts,
ideas, emotions.</i>


1061
01:18:17.655 --> 01:18:20.790
<i>Amanda holds the key
to the new world.</i>


1062
01:18:20.792 --> 01:18:24.694
<i>She has the information we need
to restore the human race,</i>


1063
01:18:24.696 --> 01:18:28.497
<i>to restore freedom and discover
our own true purpose</i>


1064
01:18:28.499 --> 01:18:30.966
<i>as life was intended to be.</i>

1065
01:18:32.503 --> 01:18:35.137
<i>Now all we have to do</i>

1066
01:18:35.139 --> 01:18:36.639
<i>is find her.</i>
