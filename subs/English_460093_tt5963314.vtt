17
00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:49.361
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
America and all the ships at sea.


18
00:02:49.363 --> 00:02:52.264
Music flash. Is The Voice
now just the gargle?


19
00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:56.268
Whether temporary or otherwise, the old
black magic that once made thousands swoon


20
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.972
when Mr. S wrenched "Night and Day" from
his sapling frame is gone from the throat.


21
00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:04.776
The bobby-soxers are no longer hypnotized by
the vocals, no longer swayed by the music.


22
00:03:04.778 --> 00:03:07.379
In fact, they are, thank
goodness, no longer.


23
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:11.350
Crooner boy Frank Sinatra's charm
seems to have gone a fleeting.


24
00:03:11.352 --> 00:03:16.822
Maybe the bobby-soxers are getting more
absorbed in such little matters as the H-bomb.


25
00:03:16.824 --> 00:03:21.593
With up-and-comers Perry Como and Eddie
Fisher climbing the charts making waves,


26
00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:24.763
Frank is officially
yesterday's news.


27
00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:26.632
Nothing personal, Frankie.

28
00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:32.671
But you know what they say:
Hot today, cold as a corpse tomorrow.

32
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:47.786
Mr. Selznick has personally
selected you, Señorita Valley.


33
00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:50.956
Oh, yes, I'm going to do
a movie with Mr. Hitchcock.


34
00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.027
Look at Selznick with the
flavor of the month.


35
00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:56.628
Goodness.

36
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.364
She's practically flaunting
those diamonds, isn't she?


37
00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:02.534
Oh, we've been hearing quite a bit about you,
Marilyn, these days,


38
00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:05.304
especially your jewelry, dear.

39
00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:07.973
Isn't it dreamy?

40
00:04:09.043 --> 00:04:11.943
David Selznick spent a lot of
flavors of the month though:


41
00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:14.613
Lena Horne, Grace
Kelly, Lana Turner.


42
00:04:14.615 --> 00:04:16.715
- Where are you from, honey?
- Philadelphia.


43
00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:19.818
And despite of what Mr. Field
says, it's a very nice place.


44
00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:22.988
Poor Nancy, it's so humiliating.

45
00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:27.092
You covered it so thoroughly.

46
00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:28.727
As did you, Lila.

47
00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.331
Speaking of which,
where's the star of hit parade?


48
00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:34.066
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

49
00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:35.967
I saw his goons lurking about.

50
00:04:43.644 --> 00:04:48.380
Surprised he shows his face at
all after reading your column.


51
00:04:48.382 --> 00:04:50.082
Just stating
the facts, dearie.


52
00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:52.951
Just the facts.

53
00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:04.429
What do they call him?

54
00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:07.632
A hundred and nineteen
pounds has-been?


55
00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:11.737
That's right.

56
00:05:11.738 --> 00:05:14.739
Let's be nice, ladies.
He's put on a little meat since.


57
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:21.145
Oh, it doesn't matter as long
as it's nineteen pounds of cock.


58
00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:32.157
Let me guess.
Washing his hands again?


59
00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.494
Oh, he's worried about his throat,
so he's washing all the germs off.


60
00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:38.063
The germs or the guilt?

61
00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:40.733
They busted him again.

62
00:05:40.734 --> 00:05:43.402
This... this whole Maxwell business,
press got him cold this time.


63
00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:44.703
Mortimer, Winchell, The Hat.

64
00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:46.138
They got nothing.

65
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.125
That's why we're here.

66
00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:54.111
I can't do this anymore. I have talked to
him about the broads and money and Nancy.


67
00:05:54.114 --> 00:05:57.382
The public knows. They know.

68
00:05:57.383 --> 00:06:00.651
They don't like him anymore. You know what
they call his show? Saturday Nightmares.


69
00:06:00.654 --> 00:06:02.554
Come on, why are you
reading that crap?


70
00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:05.857
My prediction... he'll be through in a year.
He'll be dead professionally.


71
00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:08.927
They're not gonna see his pictures.
They are not gonna can buy his records.


72
00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.730
The public will not care
about Frank Sinatra.


73
00:06:14.768 --> 00:06:16.067
Hello, gentlemen.

74
00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.170
Where is he? Where's Frank?

75
00:06:18.172 --> 00:06:21.873
Well, I do not know.
I am not his keeper, am I?


76
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:25.544
Well, he needs to speak to me
about something very important.


77
00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:28.870
He needs my help.

78
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:32.195
Because you've done
so much already.


79
00:06:32.196 --> 00:06:35.520
What Jack is trying to say is you had...
have always given Frank a fair shake. Right?


80
00:06:36.623 --> 00:06:38.056
I think he's out by the pool.

81
00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:42.861
Don't fall in, you
might ruin that hat.


82
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.584
What a witch.

You move right along, don't you?

87
00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:10.021
I thought I'd come and say hello given last
time we met, we sort of rushed things.


88
00:07:11.925 --> 00:07:13.992
You rushed things.

89
00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:15.760
I was on a date.

90
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.865
Check how I've used.

91
00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:21.166
How can I forget?

92
00:07:24.004 --> 00:07:25.804
Suppose we start over.

93
00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:30.108
So, how are you doing?

94
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.911
Making pictures as usual.

95
00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:34.980
How about you?

96
00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:38.884
I'm trying to pick
myself off my ass.


97
00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:41.152
How's that working out for you?

98
00:07:41.154 --> 00:07:42.854
Most of the times not.

99
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.562
So...

100
00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:53.799
So...

101
00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:56.134
Why don't we get out of here?

102
00:08:43.784 --> 00:08:45.684
Where did you learn
how to shoot, huh?


103
00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:57.228
All right, what kind of crazy...

104
00:09:01.301 --> 00:09:03.335
Howdy, officer.

105
00:09:03.337 --> 00:09:04.803
Working late?

106
00:09:06.073 --> 00:09:07.939
Meet Chester, the working stiff.

107
00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:11.142
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
to take that revolver from you.


108
00:09:11.144 --> 00:09:13.078
This little old thing?

109
00:09:15.882 --> 00:09:19.217
I bet it's not as big
as the one you're packing.


110
00:09:20.053 --> 00:09:21.286
Oh...

111
00:09:21.288 --> 00:09:23.254
- Ain't she something?
- She sure is.


112
00:09:25.859 --> 00:09:27.192
Boy,

113
00:09:27.194 --> 00:09:29.060
this is sure one-horse town.

114
00:09:30.397 --> 00:09:32.130
Where's the horse?

115
00:09:41.008 --> 00:09:43.458
Hello?

116
00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:45.909
Hello, Ma'am, would you mind waking up the
sheriff? It's... it's sort of important.


117
00:09:45.912 --> 00:09:47.012
<i>Hang on.</i>

118
00:09:47.014 --> 00:09:49.180

119
00:09:49.182 --> 00:09:50.982
- What?
- Telephone.


120
00:09:51.852 --> 00:09:52.851
All right.

121
00:09:52.853 --> 00:09:56.855
What's so important they should
call at this hour, hmm?


122
00:09:59.693 --> 00:10:00.692
Hello.

123
00:10:00.694 --> 00:10:01.926
<i>Sherriff, Sir, it's me, Sir.</i>

124
00:10:01.928 --> 00:10:02.994
Huh?

125
00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:04.362
You're not gonna believe this.

126
00:10:05.932 --> 00:10:08.233
I've got Frank Sinatra
and Ava Gardner.


127
00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:10.902
Frank Sinatra... Yeah,
yeah, I've heard of them.


128
00:10:10.904 --> 00:10:12.704
I'm bringing them in, Sir.

129
00:10:12.706 --> 00:10:14.706
<i>Alright, alright,
I'll be right down.</i>


130
00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:16.975
Shit.

131
00:10:16.977 --> 00:10:24.949
He got a couple of celebrities down there,
Frank Sinatra and Ava... What's her name?


132
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:27.819
- Ava Gardner?
- Yeah, Ava Gardner.


133
00:10:27.821 --> 00:10:30.405
Alright.

134
00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:33.126
Well, wait, hold them...
hold them there till I get dressed, will you?


135
00:10:33.994 --> 00:10:35.293
Evening, Miss.

136
00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:38.163
It smells bad in here.

137
00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:40.398
It's bug spray, Ma'am.

138
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.467
How about a phone, pops?

139
00:10:42.469 --> 00:10:45.203
Yeah, pops, how about it?

140
00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:47.038
Sure. You're gonna
have a phone call.


141
00:10:48.408 --> 00:10:49.708
Jimmy.

142
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.042
"Senior" is great.

143
00:10:54.448 --> 00:10:55.480
Is that Spanish?

144
00:10:57.317 --> 00:11:00.168
It's beautiful.

145
00:11:00.169 --> 00:11:03.169
Hmm, Jack, it's for you. Sounds like our
boy is lit up like a Christmas tree.


146
00:11:06.727 --> 00:11:07.425
Frank.

147
00:11:07.427 --> 00:11:09.227
Look, we're in trouble.

148
00:11:09.228 --> 00:11:11.028
When I left you at the gentlemen's
party you seemed to be in good hands.


149
00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:13.465
<i>In the old police
station of all places.</i>


150
00:11:13.467 --> 00:11:14.866
Police?

151
00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:17.268
Sherriff Lloyd Boyle.

152
00:11:18.238 --> 00:11:21.773
And... get this... I know
he is long in the tooth.


153
00:11:21.775 --> 00:11:23.535
I think some of those teeth
are made of wood.


154
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:27.278
Sober up, clam up,
put the sheriff on.


155
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.980
I want to talk to Frankie.

156
00:11:28.982 --> 00:11:30.749
Would you give me a break here?

157
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:31.783
It's for you.

158
00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:35.420
Pardon me, Miss.

159
00:11:36.356 --> 00:11:38.523
<i>Sherriff Boyle,
Jack Keller here.</i>


160
00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:42.494
Well, I just want to thank you for your
discretion and looking after Frank.


161
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.914
We all appreciate it.

162
00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:48.399
I appreciate your feeling
that way, Mr. Keller.


163
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:51.369
<i>I'm sure you are as big fan
of Frank as the rest of us.</i>


164
00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:54.439
No, never been much
of a fan. My wife is.


165
00:11:54.441 --> 00:11:57.075
Well, Sir, we want
to take care of you.


166
00:11:57.077 --> 00:11:58.843
Where exactly are you located?

167
00:11:58.845 --> 00:12:01.379
- <i>Right here in Indio.</i>
- Indio.


168
00:12:01.381 --> 00:12:05.550
That's just past Palm Desert,
Cathedral City,


169
00:12:05.552 --> 00:12:10.021
Rancho Mirage.
Just past the cemetery.


170
00:12:10.023 --> 00:12:13.258
<i>Are you sure there isn't
anything Frank can do for you?</i>


171
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.560
<i>You just name it,
anything at all.</i>


172
00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:17.529
Uh, well,

173
00:12:18.565 --> 00:12:20.965
oh, come to think of it,

174
00:12:20.967 --> 00:12:24.402
my wife and I have been
fishing one of these new gizmos.


175
00:12:26.106 --> 00:12:28.239
A television set maybe?

176
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:30.375
Sheriff Boyle, we could
definitely make that happen.


177
00:12:31.244 --> 00:12:32.844
We'll see you soon.

178
00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:34.412
Okay now? Thank you.

179
00:12:35.816 --> 00:12:37.382
Are we going to Indio?

180
00:12:37.384 --> 00:12:38.950
- Would you take care of that?
- Whoopee!


181
00:12:38.952 --> 00:12:41.853
Not you, tuts, you can
have another nightcap.


182
00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:42.954
Jesus.

183
00:12:44.424 --> 00:12:45.824
I'm a wreck.

184
00:12:50.864 --> 00:12:53.264
How long are they
gonna keep us here?


185
00:12:53.266 --> 00:12:57.001
As long as it takes Jack Keller to
drive out here from Los Angeles.


186
00:12:57.003 --> 00:12:58.303
Is he a lawyer?

187
00:12:58.305 --> 00:13:00.438
Worse. A PR man.

188
00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:04.876
Will he be able to spring us?

189
00:13:04.878 --> 00:13:06.344
Fix is in the weeks.

190
00:13:06.346 --> 00:13:09.547
Lana Turner says you get your
kicks acting like a hoodlum.


191
00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:12.116
Well, Lana Turner
has some mouth on her.


192
00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:14.319
Funny.

193
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.888
She says the very
same thing about you.


194
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.289
Forget Lana Turner.

195
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.293
- I only have eyes for you.
- Oh.


196
00:13:22.295 --> 00:13:24.462
This coming from a married man.

197
00:13:24.464 --> 00:13:26.865
What's my wife have
anything to do with it?


198
00:13:28.435 --> 00:13:35.173
Back in North Carolina proper ladies
do not associate with married men.


199
00:13:35.175 --> 00:13:38.643
Well, I may not be a saint
but you ain't no angel either.


200
00:13:39.479 --> 00:13:42.180
Mel Tormé told me all about you.

201
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.516
That goddamn crooner?

202
00:13:45.518 --> 00:13:47.252
What's wrong with crooners?

203
00:13:47.254 --> 00:13:51.923
You're all spoiled rotten
and you murder on young girls.


204
00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:53.291
Guilty as charged.

205
00:13:55.262 --> 00:13:56.628
Inbred hayseed.

206
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.396
Hoboken hoodlum.

207
00:13:59.466 --> 00:14:00.466
Redneck.

208
00:14:12.979 --> 00:14:14.646
Oh my, oh my.

209
00:14:37.404 --> 00:14:39.237
A good behavior will get all?

210
00:14:46.313 --> 00:14:47.979
Sudden cookie, huh?

211
00:14:56.122 --> 00:14:57.522
Francis!

212
00:15:01.962 --> 00:15:03.695
... as my poor
little country gal.


213
00:15:06.099 --> 00:15:10.969
That's me, all right.
Just a hillbilly with a pair of tits and ass.


214
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:14.472
Wooo, someone's got to work
on their little self-esteem.


215
00:15:14.474 --> 00:15:17.608
Don't you try
to psychoanalyze me,


216
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.244
Mr. I'm All Washed Up.

217
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.466
Cut it out.

218
00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:26.683
All my tomorrows
belong to you, baby.


219
00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:30.621
Pretty big talk, Mister S.

220
00:15:33.426 --> 00:15:35.226
What talk?

221
00:15:35.228 --> 00:15:37.395
I'm on fire for you, kitten.

222
00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:38.429
Fire?

223
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:43.768
Trust me honey, it won't last.

224
00:15:45.138 --> 00:15:48.272
Pretty soon you'll want
to mold me and


225
00:15:49.642 --> 00:15:51.409
sculpt me

226
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:53.277
like all the other
men in my life.


227
00:15:54.581 --> 00:15:57.315
This ain't my first
rodeo, cowboy.


228
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.060
<i>Lee Mortimer here.</i>

229
00:16:09.062 --> 00:16:11.195
It would appear,
unless he slugged someone,


230
00:16:11.197 --> 00:16:13.698
Frank Sinatra can't
get arrested these days.


231
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.067
<i>The latest rejection
for the washed-up crooner</i>


232
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:20.405
<i>who's been missing in action as well
as from the charts comes from the USO.</i>


233
00:16:20.407 --> 00:16:25.109
It seems that the army doesn't want
Sinatra entertaining our troops in Korea


234
00:16:25.111 --> 00:16:28.813
due to serious questions according
to General Alfred E. Kaisner


235
00:16:28.815 --> 00:16:34.419
<i>as to his sympathies to communist,
communism and unsavory fellow travelers.</i>


236
00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:39.090
<i>It's about that time that the police had a
perfect case of murder in the first degree</i>


237
00:16:39.092 --> 00:16:41.659
<i>against Mr. Anastasia
for indictment.</i>


238
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:43.594
He don't look so bad.

239
00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:45.229
He's wearing makeup.

240
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:48.099
Makeup? He's a rat,
not a Fenoitz.


241
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:51.202
Yeah. Well, somebody's gonna
take it in the ass after this.


242
00:16:51.204 --> 00:16:52.603
Hey Frank, tell me something.

243
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.606
How could you tell a guy's
wearing makeup?


244
00:16:55.608 --> 00:16:58.242
Will you turn this crap off?
I'm trying to concentrate.


245
00:16:58.244 --> 00:17:02.146
Oh yeah, that book game,
Frank, very depressing.


246
00:17:02.148 --> 00:17:03.714
No, it's just a new one.

247
00:17:03.716 --> 00:17:06.084
<i>From Here to Eternity.</i>

248
00:17:06.086 --> 00:17:07.652
Yeah, it's about the army.

249
00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.790
Love the war story? Frank,
the war's over. Cut the crap.


250
00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:15.293
Crap? Just listen.

251
00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:17.762
We surveilled the subject
and observed him interact


252
00:17:17.764 --> 00:17:21.199
with known associates
of Mr. Willie Moretti.

254
00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:24.435
Beg your pardon?

255
00:17:24.437 --> 00:17:25.636
Oh, you got a knack for it.

256
00:17:25.638 --> 00:17:28.206
You sound like the shadow.
I love that stuff.


257
00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:32.810
Detective, you are on loan to assist
Mr. Hoover's bureau. Your commentary...


258
00:17:32.812 --> 00:17:34.679
Relax.

259
00:17:34.681 --> 00:17:36.247
He's not going anywhere.

260
00:17:36.249 --> 00:17:39.417
"The bronze glow lighting
his thin child's face.


261
00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:42.587
'I'll see you, kid', he said,
puffing luxuriantly,


262
00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:44.555
like a rich man
on a fifty-cent cigar.


263
00:17:44.557 --> 00:17:46.257
It's on the bestseller list.

264
00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:47.425
Hey, Columbia bought the rights.

265
00:17:47.427 --> 00:17:50.111
Yeah, they are making a movie.

266
00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:52.796
Yeah? Hey, Frank, is there a
part in this movie for you?


267
00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:55.833
Is there...? Ain't you been
paying attention?


268
00:17:55.835 --> 00:17:58.086
Hooligan... hooligan.

269
00:17:58.087 --> 00:18:00.338
Mm-Hm. As long as there's
still Double Dynamite.

Where is he? Where's Frank?
This is his haircut day.


273
00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:16.388
Well, you can see
he's not here, right?


274
00:18:16.389 --> 00:18:18.523
I think he's making a
movie. Where the hell was that?

00:18:18.525 --> 00:18:19.525
Hawaii.

00:18:34.174 --> 00:18:35.673
Frank needs to talk to me.

279
00:18:37.177 --> 00:18:38.177
Tell him.

280
00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:47.952
Frank, you need to talk to her.

281
00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:55.860
I wouldn't be surprised if you
and MGM parted ways, Frank.


282

This Marilyn Maxwell business
won't sit well with LB.

I'm a family man, you know that.

Frank, you're a public personality and
that includes Nancy and the children.


285
00:19:06.706 --> 00:19:08.406
What's Nancy been telling you?

286
00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:11.475
That her kids wait by the phone

a lot of good pictures together.


289
00:19:19.953 --> 00:19:23.354

Frank. It didn't save Bergman.

Howard Hughes' trophy girl.

have been direct too.

For good reason.
It's great. You better read it.


312
00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:30.288
Isn't the book, what,
five hundred pages long?


313
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.989
That's right. You're
from North Carolina.


314
00:20:31.991 --> 00:20:34.659
You're the stick to the Sears Roebuck
catalog in a family outhouse.


315
00:20:34.661 --> 00:20:36.394
Jesus.

316
00:20:36.396 --> 00:20:38.362
You sound just like Artie.

317
00:20:38.364 --> 00:20:42.867
He was always putting me down,
criticizing my intelligence.


318
00:20:42.869 --> 00:20:46.771
Your ex was a prick, the biggest
prick around. You compare me to him?


319
00:20:46.773 --> 00:20:48.472
You asked for it.

320
00:20:50.343 --> 00:20:52.443
Stop tutoring me, Francis.

321
00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.080
I'm not tutoring you.

322
00:20:56.082 --> 00:20:57.948
Sure as hell are.

323
00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.718
Read this, read that.

324
00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.839
Bullshit. I'm just trying to make you
understand why this is so important to me.


325
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:06.891
It's obvious.

326
00:21:06.893 --> 00:21:10.761
You're hoping they'll past
you as Angelo Maggio.


327
00:21:10.763 --> 00:21:12.563
Give the lady a cigar.

328
00:21:29.716 --> 00:21:31.115
Breakfast?

329
00:21:31.117 --> 00:21:32.483
Will you knock it off?

330
00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:38.022
What's with this Angelo Maggio?

331
00:21:38.024 --> 00:21:40.091
Why are you so
obsessed with him?


332
00:21:40.093 --> 00:21:43.027
He's a buck private from
Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn.


333
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:44.428
And you have heard
of Brooklyn, haven't you?


334
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.630
Oh, fuck you, Francis.

335
00:21:46.632 --> 00:21:50.468
He's a fast talker streetwise cat that
doesn't give a shit about the army.


336
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.421
I know him, Ava.

337
00:21:53.422 --> 00:21:56.373
I mean if I get a chance to play Angelo Maggio,
I can hit a home run with the bases loaded.


338
00:21:56.376 --> 00:22:00.711
Okay, okay, I believe you.
You'll make a great Maggio.


339
00:22:00.713 --> 00:22:03.881
Are you kidding?
The part was made for me.


340
00:22:03.883 --> 00:22:05.916
I gotta get this part.

341
00:22:05.918 --> 00:22:08.152
I'll kill myself
if I don't get this role.


342
00:22:08.154 --> 00:22:10.955
Stop being so damn melodramatic.

343
00:22:12.058 --> 00:22:15.926
You're the greatest entertainer
this country has ever known.


344
00:22:15.928 --> 00:22:19.096
Losing a lousy film role
isn't gonna change that.


345
00:22:19.098 --> 00:22:22.967
My voice is shot. Didn't you hear me last?
It started scratching and cracking.


346
00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:25.736
- People didn't notice.
- I noticed.


347
00:22:25.738 --> 00:22:27.605
Three o'clock in the morning
I was already beat.


348
00:22:27.607 --> 00:22:29.039
This is just a bad time.

349
00:22:30.643 --> 00:22:35.413
Here, rub my ass.
It'll give you good luck.


350
00:22:35.415 --> 00:22:36.680
Hey, that's good.

351
00:22:37.717 --> 00:22:38.717
Real good.

352
00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:42.653
- I feel better already.
- Good.


353
00:22:42.655 --> 00:22:44.622
I'm glad to be of service.

354
00:22:46.626 --> 00:22:49.827
I have to face it.
I'm washed up.


355
00:22:49.829 --> 00:22:51.195
Not true.

356
00:22:52.198 --> 00:22:55.833
When you sang "Someone
to Watch Over Me" tonight,


357
00:22:56.736 --> 00:22:58.936
I had tears in my eyes.

358
00:22:58.938 --> 00:23:01.705
That's 'cause you're prejudiced.
Your favorite song.


359
00:23:02.608 --> 00:23:05.075
You brought me back to the first
time I heard it,


360
00:23:06.712 --> 00:23:10.214
when I was, what,
ten, twelve years old.


361
00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:14.585
Ava Lavinia, you better get
in there and do your chores.


362
00:23:14.587 --> 00:23:15.920
In a minute.

363
00:23:15.922 --> 00:23:17.655
In a minute.

364
00:23:17.657 --> 00:23:19.123
He's so dreamy.

365
00:23:20.126 --> 00:23:21.992
Dreamy.

366
00:23:21.994 --> 00:23:24.428
Silly, silly girl.

367
00:23:24.429 --> 00:23:26.863
Feelings that have stayed
with me until this very day.


368
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.867
Well, you have
found the mystery.


369
00:23:31.137 --> 00:23:32.603
You found your shepherd.

370
00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:35.105
I'll always watch over you.

371
00:23:35.975 --> 00:23:37.508
I'll always love you.

372
00:23:38.644 --> 00:23:40.110
I don't believe you.

373
00:23:42.515 --> 00:23:48.886
<i>♪ Baby won't you
Please come home ♪</i>


374
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.691
<i>♪ 'Cause your daddy is... ♪</i>

375
00:23:53.693 --> 00:23:55.059
How do I know you're alone?

376
00:23:56.729 --> 00:23:58.896
Well, prove to me
that you're alone.


377
00:23:58.898 --> 00:24:02.800
What do you mean you can't find
her? You can find anybody.


378
00:24:02.802 --> 00:24:06.504
Frankie. Come
with the kids to bed.


379
00:24:06.506 --> 00:24:08.005
What the fuck
am I paying you for?


380
00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:10.941
Well, get over there and
find out, goddammit.


381
00:24:10.943 --> 00:24:12.810
Never mind that.
Let me talk to you.


382
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.546
Hello.

383
00:24:15.548 --> 00:24:17.882
Well, find her, for crying
out loud, alright?


384
00:24:36.202 --> 00:24:39.803
I was lousy tonight, wasn't I, huh?
My voice was tight, it was cracking.


385
00:24:41.607 --> 00:24:46.544
Jesus, don't be so hard on yourself. You
can't bat a thousand when you're a singer.


386
00:24:46.546 --> 00:24:48.279
Yeah, but you can't strike
out every time either.


387
00:24:48.281 --> 00:24:52.816
You didn't strike out, champ,
you just didn't hit a homerun, that's all.


388
00:24:52.818 --> 00:24:55.252
Let's face it. After
fifteen years it's over.


389
00:24:55.254 --> 00:24:57.187
I lost my voice,
I lost my audience.


390
00:24:59.959 --> 00:25:01.292
I'm even losing my hair.

391
00:25:02.628 --> 00:25:05.095
Yeah, well, that's
what hats are for.


392
00:25:05.097 --> 00:25:07.298
Now listen, Cookie,
we have to talk.


393
00:25:08.301 --> 00:25:11.302
The record company decided
not to renew your contract.


394
00:25:11.304 --> 00:25:15.239
They decided to go with these young
guys Perry Como and Eddie Fisher.


395
00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:17.741
See, what did I tell you?
You see the charts?


396
00:25:17.743 --> 00:25:19.209
I'm yesterday's news, Jack.

397
00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:33.991
Okay, Frank, let's take a look.

398
00:25:36.329 --> 00:25:37.861
Vocal cords

399
00:25:38.898 --> 00:25:41.899
may be strained,
possibly a little hemorrhage.


400
00:25:43.035 --> 00:25:45.102
- Is it serious?
- Like fail?


401
00:25:46.205 --> 00:25:49.239
No, Frank, but it
explains the voice.


402
00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:50.241
What now?

403
00:25:51.744 --> 00:25:54.044
Two weeks no talking.

404
00:25:54.046 --> 00:25:56.614
No talking? What...
what about singing?


405
00:25:56.616 --> 00:25:59.917
No singing, no screaming,
no shouting.


406
00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:01.952
- What can I do?
- Whisper.


407
00:26:03.255 --> 00:26:04.788
When can I sing again?

408
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.924
Weeks, maybe months.

409
00:26:06.926 --> 00:26:10.027
These things take time,
Frank, you know. Perhaps


410
00:26:11.964 --> 00:26:14.398
switch to Camels.
It's like Joe DiMaggio.


411
00:26:32.351 --> 00:26:33.851
Right now you're down.

412
00:26:35.688 --> 00:26:38.088
They say you lost your voice.

413
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.857
They're kicking you to the curb.

414
00:26:41.427 --> 00:26:44.261
Along comes this broad,
she makes you feel good.


415
00:26:44.263 --> 00:26:47.064
Before I know,
she floats you a few books.


416
00:26:52.238 --> 00:26:54.271
When I see you,
I see an old friend of mine.


417
00:26:55.107 --> 00:26:56.707
Benny was a good man.

418
00:26:57.677 --> 00:26:59.209
We grew up together.

419
00:27:00.346 --> 00:27:02.312
He was handsome.

420
00:27:02.314 --> 00:27:03.414
He was tough.

421
00:27:03.416 --> 00:27:08.318
He was great with the ladies.
He was a visionary.


422
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.255
But along came this one broad,

423
00:27:11.257 --> 00:27:14.692
nothing special,
everyone's been with her.


424
00:27:14.694 --> 00:27:16.326
She couldn't keep
her legs crossed.


425
00:27:17.963 --> 00:27:20.030
But he went nuts for her.

426
00:27:20.032 --> 00:27:25.002
He leaves his wife, his kids,
he moves out to California.


427
00:27:25.004 --> 00:27:27.237
He thinks he's a movie star.

428
00:27:27.239 --> 00:27:28.972
Before long he's lost

429
00:27:29.942 --> 00:27:32.342
and then everything went bad.

430
00:27:32.344 --> 00:27:34.411
The Flamingo couldn't save him.

431
00:27:36.082 --> 00:27:37.481
Nobody could save him.

432
00:27:42.088 --> 00:27:44.221
Watch out for this
movie star, Frank.


433
00:27:45.191 --> 00:27:46.724
Don't get lost.

434
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.496
Could we for once not talk
about Howard Hughes?


435
00:27:52.498 --> 00:27:55.032
Why not?
You spread it, didn't you?


436
00:27:57.737 --> 00:28:00.070
Did you hear that?
They're gonna kill each other.


437
00:28:00.072 --> 00:28:01.805
Just mind your own business.

438
00:28:01.807 --> 00:28:03.474
You son of a bitch.

439
00:28:03.476 --> 00:28:06.176
You call that pitching? I guess
the Dodgers won't be calling.


440
00:28:06.178 --> 00:28:08.979
God damn you.

441
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.781
I don't know how many times I've
told you I never had sex with him.


442
00:28:11.784 --> 00:28:14.318
He bought you jewelry,
took on his fucking airplanes.


443
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.321
Just because he bought me some
trinkets doesn't mean I fucked him.


444
00:28:17.323 --> 00:28:21.125
That's right. I forgot. You like band
leaders and bullfighters, don't you?


445
00:28:21.127 --> 00:28:25.028
Did mama's little choirboy think I
was a virgin when he came calling?


446
00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.031
No, but I think maybe there was
someone out there you hadn't fucked.


447
00:28:28.033 --> 00:28:29.399
Miserable wop.

448
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.341
That clinches it.
I'm going upstairs.


449
00:28:37.343 --> 00:28:43.347
You do nothing of the kind.
Just sit there and hush.


450
00:28:43.349 --> 00:28:45.883
You can't even ask
your wife for a divorce.


451
00:28:45.885 --> 00:28:48.418
How am I supposed to ask her, huh?
She's more Catholic than the Pope.


452
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.288
Then why don't you get one of your boys
to go over there and convince her?


453
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.624
You stop talking like that.

454
00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.959
What's the matter? I thought
you were a big tough gangster.


455
00:28:55.961 --> 00:28:56.961
Yeah?

456
00:29:07.873 --> 00:29:11.441
For crying out loud, I can't believe
how they can carry on like that.


457
00:29:11.443 --> 00:29:14.978
I can. You've
just forgotten how.


458
00:29:16.582 --> 00:29:19.249
Alright, Frank, you be
a good boy, huh?


459
00:29:19.251 --> 00:29:22.419
Kiss your mommy. Daddy
will be home later. Okay.


460
00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:28.325
I got kids, remember?

461
00:29:29.495 --> 00:29:31.895
Wife and family first, right?

462
00:29:33.098 --> 00:29:35.966
Is this why we sneak around
in strange houses?


463
00:29:40.506 --> 00:29:43.073
I'm in love with you, Francis.

464
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:47.077
If I'm in love,
I want to get married.


465
00:29:50.082 --> 00:29:51.315
Otherwise

466
00:29:52.952 --> 00:29:54.284
go back to Nancy.

467
00:29:55.354 --> 00:29:57.321
You always go back anyway.

468
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:00.924
I don't want to go back.

469
00:30:02.862 --> 00:30:04.161
I love you, baby.

470
00:30:05.264 --> 00:30:07.564
I mean sometimes
you scare the shit out of me.


471
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.334
I don't know what
I'm doing with you but


472
00:30:11.403 --> 00:30:13.237
I know I can't go
without you.


473
00:30:16.008 --> 00:30:18.408
Actions, Francis.

474
00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.444
Actions.

475
00:30:20.446 --> 00:30:21.645
Where did you go?

476
00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:25.282
Spain? What
are you doing in Spain?


477
00:30:26.118 --> 00:30:27.150
Hello?

478
00:30:28.487 --> 00:30:29.519
Hello?

479
00:30:41.367 --> 00:30:43.000
Hank,

480
00:30:43.002 --> 00:30:44.668
where the fuck
is Mario Cabré?


481
00:30:53.012 --> 00:30:55.512
Mario Cabré is a fucking bullfighter,
he is writing a poem.


482
00:30:55.514 --> 00:30:57.281
Frankie, your voice.

483
00:30:57.283 --> 00:30:59.149
Fucking guy is...

484
00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:03.320
I'll call you back.

485
00:31:15.334 --> 00:31:17.234
Looking good, Mr. S.

486
00:31:17.236 --> 00:31:18.535
If you're going for Zorro.

487
00:31:20.105 --> 00:31:22.506
- Looks authentic, right?
- Yeah.


488
00:31:22.508 --> 00:31:25.342
If I didn't even know you any better,
you'd look like one of us.


489
00:31:25.344 --> 00:31:26.443
<i>Olé!</i>

490
00:31:27.479 --> 00:31:28.445
Any luck?

491
00:31:28.447 --> 00:31:29.687
She's not picking up the phone.

492
00:31:30.983 --> 00:31:33.317
But when she sees that stash...

493
00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:36.486
Never mind that.
Go, go, cut the call.


494
00:31:36.488 --> 00:31:37.738
C-note?

495
00:31:37.739 --> 00:31:38.989
That's the biggest
tip you ever got?


496
00:31:38.991 --> 00:31:39.957
Got fifty last week.

497
00:31:39.959 --> 00:31:41.525
Fifty?

498
00:31:41.527 --> 00:31:43.627
What a lousy cheapskate
gave you that?


499
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:44.962
That was you, Mister S.

500
00:31:50.636 --> 00:31:53.103
Excuse me, aren't
you Frank Sinatra?


501
00:31:53.105 --> 00:31:56.040
Depends. Who's asking?

502
00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:58.976
Former president, three years running of the
local chapter of the Sighting Society Swooners.


503
00:31:58.978 --> 00:32:01.078
Kid wants an autograph.

504
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.079
Great.

505
00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:03.146
Here you go, kid.

506
00:32:09.722 --> 00:32:11.588
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

507
00:32:12.992 --> 00:32:13.992
You've been served.

508
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:18.762
Son of a bitch.

509
00:32:21.266 --> 00:32:23.767
Frankie is planning a trip to Europe,
just about the time


510
00:32:23.769 --> 00:32:28.205
Ava leaves to make<i>Pandora and the
Flying Dutchman</i> with James Mason.


511
00:32:28.207 --> 00:32:29.439
Beautiful. Beautiful.

512
00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:31.108
One for your fans, Ava.

513
00:32:32.177 --> 00:32:33.076
Ava, right here.

514
00:32:33.078 --> 00:32:34.244
Beautiful.

515
00:32:34.246 --> 00:32:35.762
Right there.

516
00:32:35.763 --> 00:32:37.279
- Hey, there is Frank.
- That's right.


517
00:32:37.282 --> 00:32:39.049
What are you two doing
over there in Spain?


518
00:32:39.051 --> 00:32:42.185
Well, she got some sun
and I caught a few tuna.


519
00:32:42.187 --> 00:32:44.454
I was making a movie
with Hemingway.


520
00:32:44.456 --> 00:32:47.290
And we were chaperoning the whole
time just like high school dance.


521
00:32:47.292 --> 00:32:50.727
So Frank, you're gonna ask Nancy for
divorce so you two can get married?


522
00:32:50.729 --> 00:32:53.130
Well, I'm in no
position for a divorce, so.


523
00:32:53.132 --> 00:32:55.432
Oh come off it, Frank. You blew
off Nancy on Mother's Day.


524
00:32:55.434 --> 00:32:59.636
Yeah. Then what next? A divorce in Mexico
and then you two get hitched in Reno?


525
00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:03.073
How about that one, Francis?

526
00:33:03.075 --> 00:33:06.043
Hey look, fellas, you know, everyone's
talking about Ava and me getting married,


527
00:33:06.045 --> 00:33:08.279
except Ava and me.

528
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.514
Come on, Frank, you snuck off to be with her.
Come on, tell us what's the stories.


529
00:33:10.516 --> 00:33:12.349
Give me a break, fellas.
It's just a vacation.


530
00:33:12.351 --> 00:33:14.818
Oh yeah, sure, with a chaperone.
Yeah, we get it guys.


531
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.387
Yeah, who is the chaperone,
Mario Cabré?


532
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:20.357
Oh wait, wait, maybe Frank
was the chaperone.


533
00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:23.794
Hey Frank, so how'd you feel about
when he started serenading her


534
00:33:26.598 --> 00:33:28.382
with all the poetry?

535
00:33:28.383 --> 00:33:30.167
It was a publicity gimmick for the film,
alright? Just back the fuck off.


536
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:33.270
Hey, you can't talk like that.
The press made you, Frank.


537
00:33:33.272 --> 00:33:35.839
The press didn't make me.
My singing did, your miserable crumb.


538
00:33:37.242 --> 00:33:39.409
What the hell
was all that about?


539
00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:41.745
Can't get a divorce
just now?


540
00:33:41.747 --> 00:33:45.248
Can you forget those leeches?
You know I want to marry you, baby.


541
00:33:46.185 --> 00:33:48.351
Actions Francis.

542
00:33:48.353 --> 00:33:49.619
Actions.

543
00:33:56.829 --> 00:33:58.528
I think I hit something.

544
00:33:59.631 --> 00:34:01.565
I definitely did.

545
00:34:01.567 --> 00:34:02.866
I'm gonna tell her.

546
00:34:05.104 --> 00:34:07.437
You want to see action?
I'll show you action.


547
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.209
I will do it.

548
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:19.583
Nancy!

549
00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:24.721
For you, baby, I'm going
to tell her right now.


550
00:34:41.907 --> 00:34:43.440
Nancy,

551
00:34:43.442 --> 00:34:47.177
can you tell Ava that I
asked you for a divorce?


552
00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:49.279
Frank, are you
out of your mind?


553
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:52.249
- I wouldn't count on it.
- Let him go. Go, go.


554
00:34:52.251 --> 00:34:53.283
- Hey ma.
- Let him go. Go.


555
00:34:53.285 --> 00:34:55.452
She's in the car.

556
00:34:55.453 --> 00:34:57.620
You can't keep a man if he
doesn't want to be here. Go.


557
00:34:57.623 --> 00:35:00.457
He brings that white trash
whore to my house.


558
00:35:00.459 --> 00:35:06.663
Now the one I feel really sorry for is
little Nancy. She's such a fine woman.


559
00:35:06.665 --> 00:35:08.398
You just scared
the kids, alright?


560
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.834
The kids? Maybe the kids
should know about daddy.


561
00:35:10.836 --> 00:35:13.203
Maybe they should know all the
nights I was home alone with them


562
00:35:13.205 --> 00:35:14.905
while daddy was out
gallivanting around.


563
00:35:14.907 --> 00:35:17.741
What gallivanting? I was
out singing, make the records,


564
00:35:17.743 --> 00:35:19.809
doing what I gotta do
to put a roof over our head.


565
00:35:19.811 --> 00:35:21.778
Is that why you slept
with Lana Turner?


566
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.798
I get well with Lana Turner.

567
00:35:24.799 --> 00:35:27.817
Oh, and a diamond bracelet on Marilyn Maxwell
so she could flaunt it around in my face?


568
00:35:27.819 --> 00:35:30.954
Hey, you go snooping around,
I'm not responsible for what you find.


569
00:35:30.956 --> 00:35:34.357
That was in our car, damn it.
I thought it was for me.


570
00:35:34.359 --> 00:35:37.827
And then I see her wearing it.
I felt so stupid.


571
00:35:38.797 --> 00:35:42.832
You weren't stupid, alright?
You were my best friend.


572
00:35:42.834 --> 00:35:44.434
I was your wife.

573
00:35:44.436 --> 00:35:46.703
I still am your wife.

574
00:35:46.705 --> 00:35:49.739
But now I'm not
enough, am I? Am I?


575
00:35:51.376 --> 00:35:52.376
Not like that.

576
00:35:54.846 --> 00:35:56.680
You are in love with
her, aren't you?


577
00:35:56.682 --> 00:36:05.855
That green-eyed filthy white trash whore has
got her hooks in you? You broke your promise.


578
00:36:05.857 --> 00:36:08.692
What promise? Why you
talking about promise?


579
00:36:08.694 --> 00:36:10.560
I had the abortion, Frank.

580
00:36:10.562 --> 00:36:14.631
You promised me that you would
change if I took you back.


581
00:36:14.633 --> 00:36:18.235
And I believed you. You lied.

582
00:36:18.237 --> 00:36:21.805
You left me alone with the kids while
you're running around with your mob friends


583
00:36:21.807 --> 00:36:26.910
and this home-wrecking Jezebel and I
get to read all about it in the papers.


584
00:36:26.912 --> 00:36:29.913
It's not my fault what they write
in the papers, alright, Nancy?


585
00:36:29.915 --> 00:36:33.783
I'm sorry that Lee Mortimer is a rat. He
writes whatever the fuck he wants to write.


586
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.420
Ah Francis, wake up.

587
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.991
It's not the press, it's you.

588
00:36:40.993 --> 00:36:42.859
You don't give a damn
who you hurt.


589
00:36:44.263 --> 00:36:48.832
Just go. Get out.
Take your suits, your hats, your ties.


590
00:36:48.834 --> 00:36:49.834
Get out.

591
00:36:51.803 --> 00:36:53.670
I think we should get a divorce.

592
00:36:53.672 --> 00:36:56.039
I'm not gonna
make it easy, Mister.


593
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:58.441
I'm not giving you a divorce.

594
00:36:58.443 --> 00:36:59.809
Where are you going, daddy?

595
00:37:06.618 --> 00:37:08.652
Daddy is gonna go
make a record, cupcake.


596
00:37:09.655 --> 00:37:11.388
Keep an eye on things, will you?

597
00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:24.067
This will be the third
separation for the couple


598
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:30.740
and with Nancy taking the initiative
this time, it looks like the real thing.


599
00:37:30.742 --> 00:37:34.644
Items we doubt that F Sinatra's
parting from his wife is a gimmick


600
00:37:34.646 --> 00:37:37.514
to attract the attention
he used to get by crooning.


601
00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:40.317
What's Frankie doing
in New York?


602
00:37:40.319 --> 00:37:44.688
It has to do with those hearings on
television, investigating the mob.


603
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:48.625
He's meeting with the attorneys
at 4:00 a.m. to avoid the press.


604
00:37:48.627 --> 00:37:50.593
You think they're gonna
put him on television?


605
00:37:50.595 --> 00:37:52.929
If they do, it'll be
like a death sentence.


606
00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:58.034
If he gets called
before the committee,


607
00:37:58.036 --> 00:38:01.838
Harry Cohn will never read him
for the role of Angelo Maggio.


608
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.075
Well, can't you do something?

609
00:38:05.077 --> 00:38:08.011
I mean, we know
what Harry likes.


610
00:38:13.852 --> 00:38:16.953
You ever have any
business with any of the Fischettis?


611
00:38:16.955 --> 00:38:19.439
No, Sir.

612
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.640
Did either of the Fischettis
ever give you anything to carry into Cuba?


613
00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:24.828
No, Sir.

614
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:29.466
There has been stated
and certified information


615
00:38:29.468 --> 00:38:31.801
to the effect that you took
a sum of money


616
00:38:31.803 --> 00:38:35.538
in excess of one hundred
thousand dollars into Cuba.


617
00:38:39.644 --> 00:38:40.810
That is not true.

618
00:38:40.812 --> 00:38:42.946
Did you give Lucky
Luciano any money?


619
00:38:42.948 --> 00:38:44.865
No, Sir.

620
00:38:44.866 --> 00:38:46.783
Did you even learn what
business they were in?


621
00:38:48.653 --> 00:38:50.053
No, actually not.

622
00:38:50.055 --> 00:38:52.889
What is your attraction to
these underworld characters?


623
00:38:52.891 --> 00:38:57.093
I don't have an attraction for them. Some
of them were kind to me when I started out.


624
00:38:57.095 --> 00:38:59.996
You want me to believe
you don't know


625
00:38:59.998 --> 00:39:02.799
the people we've been talking
about are hoodlums and gangsters


626
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:08.538
who have committed many crimes and are
probably members of a secret criminal club?


627
00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.441
Now you're not gonna put me
on television and ruin me


628
00:39:11.443 --> 00:39:14.744
just because I know some
of these guys, are you?


629
00:39:16.448 --> 00:39:18.448
Nobody's trying to ruin you.

630
00:39:25.056 --> 00:39:27.624
The Dodgers will leave from Brooklyn.
That's never gonna happen.


631
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:32.862
Never say never. Look at the Giants. How
many games they behind in... in August, huh?


632
00:39:32.864 --> 00:39:34.431
Thirteen games behind in August.

633
00:39:34.433 --> 00:39:36.533
Yeah, but then now they are
even with the Dodgers.


634
00:39:36.535 --> 00:39:39.102
So if they win tomorrow,
they win the pennant.


635
00:39:39.104 --> 00:39:44.207
You know why I like that rookie colored
kid though, how was he? With the Giants.


636
00:39:44.209 --> 00:39:45.942
- Mays. Willie Mays.
- Mays!


637
00:39:45.944 --> 00:39:47.577
He's beautiful.

638
00:39:47.579 --> 00:39:49.546
He's gonna be a big star.

639
00:39:49.547 --> 00:39:51.514
Hey Carmine, you're gonna watch
him or you're gonna fuck him?


640
00:39:51.516 --> 00:39:53.817
That's true.

641
00:39:53.819 --> 00:39:58.688
Now, let me ask you something wise guys, huh?
Why do they call the Brooklyn's the Dodgers?


642
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:04.761
Trolley Dodgers from all the trolley racing
up and down Atlantic and Flatbush Avenue.


643
00:40:07.466 --> 00:40:09.799
Oh, give it the rest, boys.

644
00:40:09.801 --> 00:40:11.634
Out of the mountains.

645
00:40:11.636 --> 00:40:13.503
- Hey, hey. Look who's here.
- Come on, Frankie.


646
00:40:13.505 --> 00:40:16.539
Hey. Get over here, you.

647
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:20.143
Give me a kiss, you fucking
Sicilian bastard.


648
00:40:20.145 --> 00:40:24.814
Sit here near your godfather. He'll know.
Frankie, what is this constellation thing here?


649
00:40:24.816 --> 00:40:27.851
Sure, I flew him, Uncle Willie.

650
00:40:27.852 --> 00:40:30.887
I flew him to Europe, Los Angeles, Havana.
He even got bunks he could sleep in.


651
00:40:30.889 --> 00:40:32.822
Even bunks.

652
00:40:32.824 --> 00:40:35.825
But they could use to serve some coffee,
especially on the long flights.


653
00:40:35.827 --> 00:40:38.228
What, no coffee?

654
00:40:38.229 --> 00:40:40.630
Howard Hughes, he wouldn't
even go for coffee?


655
00:40:40.631 --> 00:40:43.032
Speaking of Howard Hughes, you still running
around with that Ava broad you used to go with?


656
00:40:43.034 --> 00:40:45.602
She's with me now, Uncle Willie.

657
00:40:45.603 --> 00:40:48.171
Look, Frank, you're a grown man, you do
what you got to do, it's your business,


658
00:40:48.173 --> 00:40:52.242
- but family comes first, not that wasp butane.
- Understand?


659
00:40:52.244 --> 00:40:54.711
Uncle Willie, I take care
of my kids, you know that.


660
00:40:54.713 --> 00:40:58.781
I'm talking about Nancy.
She comes into town, she goes to see my wife,


661
00:40:58.783 --> 00:41:01.751
the two of them are like, you know,
parrots, you know what I'm saying?


662
00:41:01.753 --> 00:41:06.055
You know what I mean? It's a<i>mala
faguda,</i> Frankie. You got to... you got to fix this.


663
00:41:06.057 --> 00:41:09.292
The... that twat in the newspaper,
what's her name? Hedda Hopper?


664
00:41:09.294 --> 00:41:11.761
Ah, what's she saying
about you Frank.


665
00:41:11.763 --> 00:41:14.431
I'm not saying you got
to move in with her


666
00:41:14.432 --> 00:41:17.100
but you gotta make it nice and nice,
you know, sing her a little love song.


667
00:41:17.102 --> 00:41:20.670
Hey, remember Slapsie Maxie?

668
00:41:20.672 --> 00:41:22.972
<i>♪ Nancy with the Smiling... ♪</i>

669
00:41:22.974 --> 00:41:24.941
No, no, laughing. 
Laughing Face.

670
00:41:24.943 --> 00:41:29.612
<i>♪ If I don't see her each day
I miss her ♪</i>


671
00:41:29.614 --> 00:41:31.915
Knock it off, knock
it off! Come on.


672
00:41:31.917 --> 00:41:33.616
Come on, Frankie...

673
00:41:35.587 --> 00:41:37.854
How you doing? Everything else
alright? You need anything?


674
00:41:37.856 --> 00:41:40.023
No, I'm good, don't
you worry. I'm good.


675
00:41:40.024 --> 00:41:42.191
Frank, tell Willie about that
book I always see you reading


676
00:41:42.193 --> 00:41:44.994
- about the Italian American soldier in the war.
-<i>From Here to Eternity.</i>


677
00:41:44.996 --> 00:41:47.830
It's a terrific book. It's gonna
make a great picture.


678
00:41:47.832 --> 00:41:50.733
You're gonna be in a picture?
Yeah, that's my boy.


679
00:41:50.735 --> 00:41:53.269
Well, not so fast. I mean they
haven't given me the part yet.


680
00:41:53.271 --> 00:41:56.156
You need me to talk
to somebody here?


681
00:41:56.157 --> 00:41:59.042
Well, I know the head of the studio,
Harry Cohn, and he knows me.


682
00:41:59.044 --> 00:42:01.010
Harry Cohn. We know
this guy, Johnny?


683
00:42:01.012 --> 00:42:04.881
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that...
that's the guy that's around the Joey A.


684
00:42:04.883 --> 00:42:08.051
Yeah, gambler. Jew. Big time.

685
00:42:08.053 --> 00:42:11.854
Matter of fact, he left our booster
with your partner in the marina. Yeah.


686
00:42:11.856 --> 00:42:15.892
Well, perfect parlay. They go
out to California to tour them,


687
00:42:15.894 --> 00:42:19.162
they go pay a visit to this fucking producer,
huh, alright Frankie? No?


688
00:42:19.164 --> 00:42:21.931
It's not that easy Uncle Willie.
This producer Harry Cohn,


689
00:42:21.933 --> 00:42:24.367
he shut out eighty-two thousand
bucks for the screenwriters.


690
00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:28.338
I mean he's not just gonna give away a part.
Besides, with this Kefauver Committee


691
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.107
you can't go out there and
make waves. It's too risky.


692
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:32.875
Remember my television with me?

693
00:42:32.877 --> 00:42:35.678
Mr. Moretti, you were
a member of the mafia.


694
00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.749
Yeah, come down to the shore,
I'll show you my fucking membership card.


695
00:42:39.751 --> 00:42:44.087
Besides, when the studio was hanging by a
thread and I was big, I did him a big favor.


696
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:47.357
I helped him out.
So, this guy owes me.


697
00:42:47.358 --> 00:42:50.626
Alright Frank, let's go. I gotta go, guys.
Take care. I'll see you guys later.


698
00:42:50.629 --> 00:42:52.862
Bet those fucking
Dodgers, alright?


699
00:42:52.864 --> 00:42:56.366
Listen to me, don't worry about it,
this is no different than that fucking leave.


700
00:42:56.368 --> 00:42:58.835
Besides, after tomorrow,
how about the 82?


701
00:42:58.837 --> 00:43:01.904
I'll give it back to him, alright?
Everything will be good. I love you, alright?


702
00:43:01.906 --> 00:43:03.339
I gotta go set up the bar.

703
00:43:03.341 --> 00:43:04.341
Excuse me, boys.

704
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:14.784
You're a good man, Frank.

705
00:43:16.321 --> 00:43:18.855
You sing but you don't talk.

706
00:43:18.857 --> 00:43:20.189
How you doing, Mike?

707
00:43:21.092 --> 00:43:23.660
Watch out for that favor, Frank.

708
00:43:23.662 --> 00:43:27.430
Willie Moore likes to talk.
He talks to the reporters,


709
00:43:27.432 --> 00:43:30.133
he goes on television,
he makes jokes.


710
00:43:31.169 --> 00:43:32.702
Not you, right, Frank?

711
00:43:33.371 --> 00:43:36.873
Hello and goodbye.
I notice things like that.


712
00:43:39.811 --> 00:43:43.212
<i>News flash.
Willie Moore is no more.</i>


713
00:43:43.214 --> 00:43:48.084
<i>Shots rang out at Joe's Elbow Room
restaurant in Cliffside Park, New Jersey,</i>


714
00:43:48.086 --> 00:43:52.055
<i>where racketeer and gambler Willie
Moretti was executed gangland style</i>


715
00:43:52.057 --> 00:43:54.441
<i>in a hail of bullets.</i>

716
00:43:54.442 --> 00:43:56.826
<i>The fifty-seven-year-old Hasbrouck Heights,
New Jersey resident</i>


717
00:43:56.828 --> 00:44:00.196
<i>who reportedly had fallen out
of favor with La Cosa Nostra,</i>


718
00:44:00.198 --> 00:44:02.649
<i>due to his large gambling debts</i>

719
00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:05.101
<i>and for talking too much to
congressional investigative committees</i>


720
00:44:05.103 --> 00:44:09.172
<i>was a known longtime associate of another
former Hasbrouck Heights resident,</i>


721
00:44:09.174 --> 00:44:14.944
<i>one F. Sinatra, who even sang at the
wedding of a Moretti daughter in 1947.</i>


722
00:44:14.946 --> 00:44:19.348
<i>Despite the declining crooner's connection
with Moretti and other underworld figures,</i>


723
00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:23.119
<i>Senator Kefauver's committee
declined to call Sinatra to testify</i>


724
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:25.822
<i>and thus spared him
a public lambasting</i>


725
00:44:25.824 --> 00:44:30.493
<i>that would have no doubt finished off
a career already on life support.</i>


726
00:44:30.495 --> 00:44:32.962
What's this thing you
have for the mafia?


727
00:44:32.964 --> 00:44:35.198
I don't have a thing
for the mafia.


728
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.800
Then why are you always
hanging out with them?


729
00:44:37.802 --> 00:44:42.338
I started singing in New Jersey, remember? Most
of the clubs and gin mills are owned by the boys.


730
00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.809
But you're not singing in New Jersey anymore.
You're singing in Las Vegas.


731
00:44:46.811 --> 00:44:50.313
Yeah? Who do you think runs
that town, the Salvation Army?


732
00:44:50.315 --> 00:44:52.482
According to Lee Mortimer

733
00:44:52.484 --> 00:44:57.019
you're just a washed-up crooner
who's now a bagman for the mob.


734
00:44:57.021 --> 00:44:58.855
Yeah, well Mortimer is a fink.

735
00:44:59.958 --> 00:45:03.893
Now's the perfect time for you to
cut your ties with these people.


736
00:45:04.929 --> 00:45:06.829
What are you saying?
Turn my back on my friends?


737
00:45:06.831 --> 00:45:09.349
It's an Italian thing.

738
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.868
Yeah, an Italian thing.
So, it's something you wise can't understand.


739
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:14.837
Basic human values
like friendship and loyalty.


740
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:18.908
Stop your ranting.

741
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.844
It's not gonna change
your public image.


742
00:45:21.846 --> 00:45:25.114
My public image will change once
I get to play Angelo Maggio.


743
00:45:25.984 --> 00:45:30.419
<i>From Here to Eternity</i> is
a whole different ball of wax.


744
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:33.923
They're testing heavyweight
actors for the role you want.


745
00:45:33.925 --> 00:45:36.859
Harvey Lembeck, Eli Wallach.

746
00:45:36.861 --> 00:45:39.195
Hey, those guys don't scare me.

747
00:45:39.197 --> 00:45:41.230
They can only play Maggio
from the outside.


748
00:45:41.232 --> 00:45:44.333
I can play him from the inside.
I am Angelo Maggio.


749
00:45:46.538 --> 00:45:49.438
My little tap dancer
in a sailor suit.


750
00:45:52.944 --> 00:45:56.979
And I can make it happen,
especially you picking a little help.


751
00:45:58.416 --> 00:45:59.982
Meaning?

752
00:45:59.984 --> 00:46:02.285
You are friends with Harry
Cohn's wife, right?


753
00:46:02.287 --> 00:46:05.221
So why don't you meet with her
and then work to her husband?


754
00:46:07.325 --> 00:46:12.028
Francis, isn't pulling strings
like that a Hollywood no-no?


755
00:46:13.932 --> 00:46:15.565
Baby,

756
00:46:15.567 --> 00:46:18.401
I wanna help, I really do,

757
00:46:19.337 --> 00:46:22.939
but I've been offered
a part in another movie.


758
00:46:22.941 --> 00:46:24.140
Another movie?

759
00:46:25.276 --> 00:46:28.144
It's called<i>Mogambo.</i>

760
00:46:28.146 --> 00:46:30.379
John Ford's directing.

761
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.850
What's the part like?

762
00:46:33.852 --> 00:46:37.053
It's good, baby. Real good.

763
00:46:37.055 --> 00:46:40.489
Oh good. Oh good. Yeah.

764
00:46:40.491 --> 00:46:42.458
- The best catch.
- Catch?


765
00:46:43.528 --> 00:46:46.329
- It's gonna be shot at a location.
- Location?


766
00:46:47.265 --> 00:46:50.433
Yes, in Africa.

767
00:46:51.469 --> 00:46:52.602
Africa?

768
00:46:55.373 --> 00:46:57.406
Where did my little guinea go?

769
00:47:01.112 --> 00:47:02.912
So, a diamond
is your best friend?


770
00:47:07.385 --> 00:47:09.118
What do you say
we get married?


771
00:47:11.356 --> 00:47:12.889
Francis.

772
00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:19.028
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America.
Hang on to your body socks.


773
00:47:20.231 --> 00:47:22.531
Frank and Ava to get married.

774
00:47:22.533 --> 00:47:25.301
Oh baby, I love
the sound of that.


775
00:47:26.304 --> 00:47:31.207
Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner got
married only days after his formal divorce.


776
00:47:31.209 --> 00:47:34.176
The couple married in a
private home in Philadelphia


777
00:47:34.178 --> 00:47:39.615
before slipping away only to be spotted
the next day walking along a Havana shore


778
00:47:39.617 --> 00:47:43.386
in what anyone
could call beach attire.


779
00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:51.994
Truth is the only time I'm happy is
when I'm doing absolutely nothing.


780
00:47:51.996 --> 00:47:54.497
Whatever do you
mean by that, dear?


781
00:47:56.034 --> 00:47:57.934
Anybody want a lollipop?

782
00:48:02.006 --> 00:48:03.606
Let's put it this way.

783
00:48:04.509 --> 00:48:09.245
I was going to be a secretary,
but I'd rather be a star.


784
00:48:09.247 --> 00:48:11.480
Are you kidding, a secretary?

785
00:48:11.482 --> 00:48:14.984
You'll be selling yourself
short. You're a star.


786
00:48:14.986 --> 00:48:17.253
Hey nice outfit, Frank.
Hold that. Hold that.


787
00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.358
You remember her
in<i>Showboat</i>, don't you?


788
00:48:22.359 --> 00:48:25.427
She held her own with Kathryn Grayson,
Howard Keel. You lit up the screen.


789
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:28.130
Come on and have
a drink with me, baby.


790
00:48:28.132 --> 00:48:31.067
I'm bored all by myself.

791
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:34.303
Not until I make an omelet
fit for a queen.


792
00:48:34.305 --> 00:48:39.241
After all, the article she's inscribing is
entitled "Breakfast with the Sinatras."


793
00:48:44.215 --> 00:48:46.449
How simply adorable.

794
00:48:47.752 --> 00:48:52.722
I didn't know Frank
could be so subservient.


795
00:48:52.724 --> 00:48:59.028
Holding doors, pulling out
chairs, lighting your cigarette.


796
00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:01.664
Marriage, ain't it something?

797
00:49:03.334 --> 00:49:05.301
To get back to your question,

798
00:49:06.337 --> 00:49:09.705
I'll go on acting as long as it
gives me financial security.


799
00:49:09.707 --> 00:49:12.541
Is it true about you
wanting a family?


800
00:49:12.543 --> 00:49:16.045
Well, sure, any time.

801
00:49:16.748 --> 00:49:17.748
I'm ready.

802
00:49:20.685 --> 00:49:22.785
God, I look sick, don't I?

803
00:49:24.088 --> 00:49:25.088
Terrific.

804
00:49:25.723 --> 00:49:28.057
You just gotta eat, that's all.

805
00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:29.225
<i>Voilá.</i>

806
00:49:30.628 --> 00:49:33.763
That looks absolutely
scrumptious.


807
00:49:35.466 --> 00:49:39.468
Frank, they say there isn't
anything you wouldn't do for Ava.


808
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:43.272
Sure. Anything for my angel.

809
00:49:43.274 --> 00:49:45.674
Even doing theater in Nairobi?

810
00:49:45.676 --> 00:49:48.811
I'd sing namaz if that meant
being close to you, baby.


811
00:49:51.082 --> 00:49:54.216
But they say being
married to Ava


812
00:49:54.218 --> 00:49:56.819
is like sitting on cracked eggs.

813
00:49:57.755 --> 00:50:00.489
You never know what kind
of mood she's gonna be in.


814
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:03.476
Nonsense.

815
00:50:03.477 --> 00:50:06.462
The only cracked eggs are the ones I
used to make this omelet. Now let's see.


816
00:50:06.464 --> 00:50:09.398
Next topic, dearie.

817
00:50:11.669 --> 00:50:15.738
So, in your country you
are an actress, right?


818
00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.139
Yes.

819
00:50:17.141 --> 00:50:18.774
And you speak good
English, right?


820
00:50:18.776 --> 00:50:21.143
Yes.

821
00:50:21.144 --> 00:50:23.511
And in your country possums
pilot airplanes, right?


822
00:50:23.514 --> 00:50:25.481
- Yes.
- Yeah, right.


823
00:50:26.551 --> 00:50:28.684
God damn it, can't
you see I'm busy?


824
00:50:28.686 --> 00:50:32.588
Mr. C, I'm so sorry. Mr. Zinnemann,
Mr. Adler, they just barged in.


825
00:50:33.491 --> 00:50:37.660
What the hell do you want? You can't be out
of money, you haven't started shooting yet.


826
00:50:37.662 --> 00:50:39.395
It's the Maggio.

827
00:50:39.397 --> 00:50:41.631
What about it?

828
00:50:41.632 --> 00:50:43.866
We keep getting telegrams from
Sinatra asking when he can audition.


829
00:50:43.868 --> 00:50:46.335
He's saying you
promised the testing.


830
00:50:46.337 --> 00:50:49.672
I mean he signs the telegrams
"Maggio", for crying out loud.


831
00:50:49.674 --> 00:50:52.641
Mr. Cohn, I think
we've got our guy.


832
00:50:52.643 --> 00:50:54.927
Yeah?

833
00:50:54.928 --> 00:50:57.212
Eli Wallach, stage actor,
New York, Actors Studio.


834
00:50:57.215 --> 00:50:59.815
Yeah, I saw him in the roles. That's who is.
He's brilliant. Wasn't he brilliant?


835
00:50:59.817 --> 00:51:01.484
- Yeah.
- Works with the Elia Kazan.


836
00:51:01.486 --> 00:51:03.319
Elia Kazan.

837
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:05.688
I think he's a communist.
I don't need trouble.


838
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.225
Works? Who said works? Fred,
I don't think they actually worked together.


839
00:51:09.227 --> 00:51:11.327
Did I mean work?

840
00:51:11.328 --> 00:51:13.428
He didn't mean work.
He meant that... that they know each other.


841
00:51:13.431 --> 00:51:15.731
- Isn't that what you meant, Fred?
- They... they know each other.


842
00:51:15.733 --> 00:51:18.117
They know each other?

843
00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:20.502
Yeah, I mean they met a couple of times,
once or twice at the very most,


844
00:51:20.505 --> 00:51:22.689
isn't that right, Fred?

845
00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.874
They met at the theater,
the Actors Studio.


846
00:51:24.876 --> 00:51:27.676
I mean it's a big theater,
plenty of seats.


847
00:51:27.678 --> 00:51:30.045
You know, and
besides, I mean,


848
00:51:30.046 --> 00:51:32.413
who has more baggage than Sinatra with
the divorce, living with Ava Gardner?


849
00:51:32.416 --> 00:51:35.918
You got a point. Okay, fine, done deal. Now
get the hell out of here, both of you. Minna.


850
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.586
This way, gentlemen.

851
00:51:37.588 --> 00:51:40.189
No kidding, he'll be great.
This is terrific.


852
00:51:40.191 --> 00:51:43.526
We already spoke to his agent and we can
get him for twenty-thousand dollars.


853
00:51:43.528 --> 00:51:46.896
Whoa, whoa twenty thousand dollars?
Hold the wire. Hold the wire.


854
00:51:46.898 --> 00:51:51.433
Darling, do me favor. Give
me a second now, will you doll?


855
00:51:51.435 --> 00:51:53.419
Yes.

856
00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.404
Minna, have her wait outside.
Bye-bye, Lubov.


857
00:51:55.406 --> 00:51:56.438
Hello.

858
00:51:58.943 --> 00:52:01.744
- Minna, get me this... what's the name again?
- Eli Wallach.


859
00:52:01.746 --> 00:52:04.780
Give me this Eli... Eli Wallach's
agent on the phone. Sit down, boys.


860
00:52:04.782 --> 00:52:07.650
Twenty-thousand smackers,
who the hell he think he is, Gable?


861
00:52:07.652 --> 00:52:11.954
Mr. C, Ava Gardner is on the line,
she's with Mrs. C and they've just had lunch.


862
00:52:11.956 --> 00:52:15.524
Sorry boys, but I need you to clear out.
Send her, what's the name, back in.


863
00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.260
- Lubov.
- Yeah, Lubov.


864
00:52:21.566 --> 00:52:23.966
Ava, Ava, Ava.

865
00:52:23.968 --> 00:52:25.634
Hello, hello, hello.

866
00:52:26.671 --> 00:52:28.404
I was just
thinking about you.


867
00:52:29.373 --> 00:52:32.675
Lee Mortimer here. The
crowning blow for Frankie boy


868
00:52:32.677 --> 00:52:38.948
is that the Music Corporation of America announced
its decision to withdraw him as his agent.


869
00:52:41.586 --> 00:52:42.685
Hey.

870
00:52:44.455 --> 00:52:47.323
How is that very
bad boy of yours?


871
00:52:47.325 --> 00:52:50.726
Don't worry darling.
Mommy's got him under control.


872
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.430
- I just met...
- Harry, hello.


873
00:52:54.432 --> 00:52:57.766
Ms. Ava, or should
I say Mrs. Frank?


874
00:52:59.971 --> 00:53:03.672
- Claudia was just leaving.
- Excuse me, Claudia.


875
00:53:04.575 --> 00:53:06.642
When are we going
to work together?


876
00:53:06.644 --> 00:53:09.712
Next time you're in town call my
girl, tell her to pencil you in.


877
00:53:09.714 --> 00:53:12.348
Oh, come on Harry,
don't play with me.


878
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:16.719
Tell her five o'clock. I'll either make
you a movie star or I'll marry you.


879
00:53:23.928 --> 00:53:26.528
Can I pour you a drink?

880
00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:28.564
You got a lot of nerve
calling my wife.


881
00:53:28.566 --> 00:53:30.032
I love Joan.

882
00:53:30.034 --> 00:53:31.967
I hope she's feeling better.

883
00:53:31.969 --> 00:53:34.336
She was under the weather
when we had lunch.


884
00:53:34.338 --> 00:53:35.638
You had lunch?

885
00:53:36.774 --> 00:53:38.607
I'm sure it was lovely.

886
00:53:38.609 --> 00:53:42.011
You mind telling me what
you talked about at this lunch?


887
00:53:43.314 --> 00:53:47.283
Harry, you know that no-good
bastard husband of mine


888
00:53:47.285 --> 00:53:50.386
is perfect for the role of Maggio
in this picture you're doing.


889
00:53:50.388 --> 00:53:52.421
Ah, you don't say.

890
00:53:52.423 --> 00:53:55.391
Harry, the role
was made for him.


891
00:53:57.528 --> 00:54:01.830
And I suppose you think I should give him
an audition, huh? It's like chutzpah.


892
00:54:03.668 --> 00:54:05.801
Don't you want me to be happy?

893
00:54:05.803 --> 00:54:06.803
Yeah.

894
00:54:08.005 --> 00:54:11.373
You got more balls
than half the men I know. So,


895
00:54:20.084 --> 00:54:22.418
how about we go
somewhere more quiet,


896
00:54:23.721 --> 00:54:25.321
talk about this.

897
00:54:28.993 --> 00:54:33.395
Director Fred Zinnemann
has gone to New York


898
00:54:33.397 --> 00:54:37.066
to test stage players
for<i>From Here to Eternity.</i>


899
00:54:37.068 --> 00:54:42.037
Meanwhile, Frank is still pitching
hard for that Maggio role.


900
00:54:42.039 --> 00:54:48.043
The Eternity film could open up a completely
new phase in Sinatra's acting career.


901
00:54:48.045 --> 00:54:51.914
What is so important? Is it Ava?

902
00:54:51.916 --> 00:54:56.118
It's all the wires that you two are
desperately trying to avoid a crack-up?


903
00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.787
We're having oral battles
but I'm trying to fix it all up.


904
00:54:58.789 --> 00:55:01.890
Oral battles, sounds
like pornography.


905
00:55:01.892 --> 00:55:03.525
Fix her, Frank.

906
00:55:03.527 --> 00:55:06.245
You don't need no more
heat from the press.


907
00:55:06.246 --> 00:55:08.964
Between divorce and Nancy and this
asshole Mortimer, you got plenty.


908
00:55:08.966 --> 00:55:11.967
Harry, I want to play Maggio.

909
00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:16.839
I know you want to play Maggio.
I got your telegrams.


910
00:55:16.841 --> 00:55:20.442
We all got your telegrams,
sometimes twice a week


911
00:55:21.612 --> 00:55:25.614
You know, Buddy's thinking of paving
his washroom with your telegrams.


912
00:55:25.616 --> 00:55:28.550
- Harry, me and you go way back, right?
- Yeah.


913
00:55:28.552 --> 00:55:30.786
The role is written
about a guy just like me.


914
00:55:30.788 --> 00:55:33.655
Yeah. But can you play
a guy like you?


915
00:55:34.625 --> 00:55:36.058
It is me, Harry.

916
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:42.898
You must be out of your fucking mind. That's an
actor's part, not a crooner. You're a crooner.


917
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.567
I'm an actor. Come on,
give me a chance to act.


918
00:55:45.569 --> 00:55:50.572
What do you from acting? You know how to
sing and you can sing with the best of them.


919
00:55:50.574 --> 00:55:52.441
You know how to dance
and you got a good smile.


920
00:55:52.443 --> 00:55:56.078
William Powell knows from acting.
You don't know from acting.


921
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.480
Give me one more of these. You
know what I know from acting?


922
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:05.020
I'm watching a dog like... what's a good dog,
Double Dynamite. Double Dynamite.


923
00:56:05.022 --> 00:56:07.756
And I squirm in my seat
from the pain of my tuchus.


924
00:56:09.093 --> 00:56:11.026
All right, I admit
that was dreck.


925
00:56:11.028 --> 00:56:12.928
But Maggio
is completely different.


926
00:56:15.433 --> 00:56:19.701
They are testing serious actors.
Eli Wallach, he's a stage actor.


927
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:28.110
- About the money?
- Who's talking of money?


928
00:56:29.747 --> 00:56:31.614
But what about the money?

929
00:56:31.615 --> 00:56:33.482
I used to get a hundred fifty
thousand a picture, right?


930
00:56:33.484 --> 00:56:36.652
You used to get a hundred fifty
thousand a picture, yes.


931
00:56:36.654 --> 00:56:37.853
I'll do it for expenses.

932
00:56:38.689 --> 00:56:40.789
Give me expenses,
you got your Maggio.


933
00:56:40.791 --> 00:56:42.691
You want it that bad, huh Frank?

934
00:56:42.693 --> 00:56:44.927
Harry, it's me.

935
00:56:48.566 --> 00:56:50.632
We'll see, Frank, we'll see.
Let me think it over.


936
00:56:50.634 --> 00:56:54.570
- You are not turning me down?
- I was but we'll see, we'll see.


937
00:56:55.606 --> 00:56:57.072
You won't regret it, Harry.

938
00:56:57.074 --> 00:56:58.507
One more thing.

939
00:56:59.143 --> 00:57:01.109
You tell anybody about this,

940
00:57:02.513 --> 00:57:04.513
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch.


941
00:57:10.988 --> 00:57:13.222
Frank, are you up to
Africa to visit Ava?


942
00:57:13.224 --> 00:57:15.224
I miss my wife.

943
00:57:15.225 --> 00:57:17.225
I miss my wife. There is
like lions, baters...


944
00:57:17.228 --> 00:57:18.961
- Clark Gable.
- Thank you.


945
00:57:18.963 --> 00:57:21.096
Hey, Gable shot
mixed this week.


946
00:57:21.098 --> 00:57:22.681
What do you got to say
about that?


947
00:57:22.682 --> 00:57:24.265
How do you feel about Ava
working with the King?


948
00:57:24.268 --> 00:57:26.034
Clark Gable is the greatest
actor of our time.


949
00:57:26.036 --> 00:57:27.769
Yeah. You gonna be working
with Ava on<i>Mogambo</i>?


950
00:57:27.771 --> 00:57:30.105
I'm gonna put black paste
and play a native, okay?


951
00:57:30.107 --> 00:57:31.674
So, you're not gonna
work at all?


952
00:57:31.675 --> 00:57:33.242
I'm gonna sing in a couple of
nightclubs in Nairobi, alright?


953
00:57:33.244 --> 00:57:35.144
Who's gonna open, Tarzan?

954
00:57:35.145 --> 00:57:37.045
Very funny. Bing Crosby,
the greatest singer of our time, folks.


955
00:57:37.047 --> 00:57:38.547
Wait a second, Frank.

956
00:57:42.286 --> 00:57:44.720
Stop it, you can't ask that.

957
00:57:51.762 --> 00:57:54.830
No, Frank is bigger.

958
00:57:54.832 --> 00:57:57.733
Really? Bigger? No way.

959
00:57:57.735 --> 00:58:01.203
Thank you, Ndungo. Asante.

960
00:58:01.205 --> 00:58:02.905
Asante.

961
00:58:02.907 --> 00:58:04.106
Asante.

962
00:58:10.581 --> 00:58:11.914
Hi, papa.

963
00:58:11.916 --> 00:58:13.582
Hello, ladies.

964
00:58:15.686 --> 00:58:19.621
Evidently, I am your new valet.

965
00:58:19.623 --> 00:58:20.856
Oh, for me?

966
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.626
- Here, one for you too.
- Oh.


967
00:58:25.696 --> 00:58:27.629
Looks like the King summons.

968
00:58:29.833 --> 00:58:31.900
Frank is coming over.

969
00:58:31.902 --> 00:58:35.571
He misses me.
That little dago.


970
00:58:35.573 --> 00:58:38.307
Zinnemann finally agreed
to give him that screen test.


971
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:39.341
Did he?

972
00:58:39.343 --> 00:58:45.814
Well, on the set I don't mind having Frank,
I got no problem with Frank at all.


973
00:58:45.816 --> 00:58:48.701
Thank you, papa.

974
00:58:48.702 --> 00:58:51.587
Maybe he'll make us that beautiful
linguini he loves to make.


975
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:54.590
Thank you.

976
00:58:54.591 --> 00:58:57.592
Doctors pumped powerful shots of
antibiotics into actress Ava Gardner


977
00:58:57.595 --> 00:59:02.965
to beat down a tropical infection
picked up while movie-making in Africa.


978
00:59:02.967 --> 00:59:09.071
The wife of crooner FS apparently made
the mistake of drinking local water


979
00:59:09.073 --> 00:59:14.276
in Kenya's nature country and laid
in pain with stomach troubles.


980
00:59:14.278 --> 00:59:18.647
Meantime, hubby Frank
did not make any new friends


981
00:59:18.649 --> 00:59:22.718
walking out on Shirley Jones
and the set of<i>Carousel.</i>


982
00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:27.756
Off to Rome perhaps to join the little
missus who's there convalescing.


983
00:59:27.758 --> 00:59:30.125
Sounds like the little
missus insisted.


984
00:59:30.995 --> 00:59:32.361
Who have you told?

985
00:59:32.363 --> 00:59:34.029
So far just you.

986
00:59:34.031 --> 00:59:36.031
Is it Frank's?

987
00:59:36.033 --> 00:59:37.033
Yes.

988
00:59:38.902 --> 00:59:40.135
I'm pretty sure.

989
00:59:40.137 --> 00:59:41.169
Pretty sure?

990
00:59:41.171 --> 00:59:45.407
Half the world's female population
would throw themselves at Frank's feet


991
00:59:45.409 --> 00:59:50.178
and here you are flouncing around with men
who wear capes and little ballerina slippers.


992
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.813
Bogie tell you that one?

993
00:59:51.815 --> 00:59:54.783
Never mind him. What
are you going to do?


994
00:59:58.122 --> 00:59:59.388
I'm not having it.

995
01:00:00.658 --> 01:00:02.791
It's my insides
we're talking about.


996
01:00:03.894 --> 01:00:06.762
Besides, the studio
would penalize me.


997
01:00:06.764 --> 01:00:08.830
It doesn't have to be that way.

998
01:00:08.832 --> 01:00:12.434
When I had Stephen and Leslie,
I told those sons of bitches to fuck off.


999
01:00:12.436 --> 01:00:16.672
That was easy for you
to say, you have Bogie.


1000
01:00:16.674 --> 01:00:20.242
And you have Frank,
who lives and dies by you.


1001
01:00:20.244 --> 01:00:22.210
He is a Catholic, by the way.

1002
01:00:22.212 --> 01:00:25.213
He would absolutely
want you to have his child.


1003
01:00:25.215 --> 01:00:26.248
Why?

1004
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:30.018
So, I can sit at home
with his baby,


1005
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:35.791
cold, hungry, and in the dark while
he and his rats go off chasing tail?


1006
01:00:39.763 --> 01:00:41.196
Oh for God's sake.

1007
01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:48.270
There's a clinic in London
on Harley Street.


1008
01:00:48.272 --> 01:00:50.338
You shouldn't go alone.

1009
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.107
I will go with you.

1010
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:53.175
Thank you.

1011
01:01:01.285 --> 01:01:03.251
Come here
and meet me at the airport.


1012
01:01:03.253 --> 01:01:06.488
I never got your telegram
with your time of arrival.


1013
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:08.490
Never got?

1014
01:01:08.491 --> 01:01:10.491
What, it didn't have Western
Union office out in the bush?


1015
01:01:10.494 --> 01:01:12.828
Francis, I'm sorry.

1016
01:01:14.098 --> 01:01:15.964
Come on up, baby.

1017
01:01:17.401 --> 01:01:19.067
Gable?

1018
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:21.470
How you getting on
with Clark Gable?


1019
01:01:21.472 --> 01:01:23.505
Like a dream.

1020
01:01:23.507 --> 01:01:25.941
There's a reason why
they call him the King.


1021
01:01:27.144 --> 01:01:28.343
Are you fucking him?

1022
01:01:29.813 --> 01:01:31.513
What did you say?

1023
01:01:31.515 --> 01:01:33.415
I asked you a question.

1024
01:01:33.417 --> 01:01:35.951
Are you fucking Clark Gable?

1025
01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:38.220
You suspicious son of a bitch.

1026
01:01:38.222 --> 01:01:40.455
Hey, I know you, that's why.

1027
01:01:40.457 --> 01:01:43.024
And I know how it goes
on movie locations.


1028
01:01:44.294 --> 01:01:49.264
King Gable is having a big hot
thing with the Ice Queen herself,


1029
01:01:49.266 --> 01:01:51.233
little Miss Grace Kelly.

1030
01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:54.536
You jealous?

1031
01:01:54.538 --> 01:01:56.271
You're the jealous one.

1032
01:01:58.142 --> 01:02:01.577
Can't help myself.

1033
01:02:01.578 --> 01:02:05.013
I mean that last phone call, you left me all
depressed, like, my imagination ran wild.


1034
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.153
Listen,

1035
01:02:12.456 --> 01:02:16.224
I asked you to come
here, remember?


1036
01:02:16.226 --> 01:02:20.562
So, why don't you quit
giving me the third degree


1037
01:02:21.832 --> 01:02:23.532
and come over here

1038
01:02:23.534 --> 01:02:25.433
and fuck me already.

1039
01:02:40.284 --> 01:02:41.983
You know how much I miss you?

1040
01:02:43.587 --> 01:02:45.020
Same here.

1041
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:48.290
You're my fate,

1042
01:02:49.393 --> 01:02:51.493
you guinea bastard.

1043
01:02:52.896 --> 01:02:56.097
You're my fate, you redneck
piece of poor white trash.


1044
01:03:01.371 --> 01:03:02.938
Do you forgive me?

1045
01:03:05.175 --> 01:03:07.242
I forgive you for
everything you did


1046
01:03:08.345 --> 01:03:09.978
and everything you're gonna do.

1047
01:03:14.852 --> 01:03:19.621
Okay. Coming out, the terror
of Gimbels' basement.


1048
01:03:19.623 --> 01:03:20.623
Coming out,

1049
01:03:21.925 --> 01:03:23.024
seven,

1050
01:03:24.127 --> 01:03:26.144
seven...

1051
01:03:26.145 --> 01:03:28.162
Don't overdo the slurring
of your words.


1052
01:03:29.099 --> 01:03:34.002
Most people try to hide their
drunkenness by slowing down their speech


1053
01:03:34.004 --> 01:03:36.638
and over-enunciating
everything they say.


1054
01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.274
- Where did you learn that?
- Michael Chekhov.


1055
01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:43.178
He's Anton Chekhov's nephew.

1056
01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:45.113
You should take
classes with him.


1057
01:03:45.115 --> 01:03:48.483
I'll need no classes, I know
how to play Angelo Maggio.


1058
01:03:48.485 --> 01:03:51.253
Michael's a magician
with actors.


1059
01:03:51.255 --> 01:03:54.489
I don't need that Stanislavski
bullshit, all right?


1060
01:03:54.491 --> 01:03:56.491
Don't be so damn cocky.

1061
01:03:56.493 --> 01:03:58.093
I'm not cocky.

1062
01:03:58.095 --> 01:04:00.595
Truth be told,
I'm scared, all right?


1063
01:04:00.597 --> 01:04:01.997
That's all right.

1064
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I get scared when
I go on stage to sing.


1065
01:04:05.002 --> 01:04:06.635
The minute I step on that stage,

1066
01:04:07.638 --> 01:04:10.205
it's like shazam,

1067
01:04:10.207 --> 01:04:12.941
I become a different person.

1068
01:04:12.943 --> 01:04:14.209
It's like magic.

1069
01:04:14.211 --> 01:04:17.045
Come back to bed, magic man.

01:04:56.486 --> 01:04:57.652
I'm pregnant.

1080
01:05:04.661 --> 01:05:06.328
Oh my God,
Frank Sinatra.


1081
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:09.197
Excuse me, can I
have autograph for me?


1082
01:05:09.199 --> 01:05:11.232
Please, she's my girlfriend.

1083
01:05:11.234 --> 01:05:17.238
I'm your fan. I have the paper
and also a pen somewhere.


1084
01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.200
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you very much.


1085
01:05:20.143 --> 01:05:22.377
<i>- Grazie.</i>
- Can I have also a picture with you?


1086
01:05:22.379 --> 01:05:25.347
Please, just
a picture, okay?


1087
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:27.182
Thank you.

1088
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.720
- Okay,<i>grazie.</i>
- Thank you very much.


1089
01:05:31.722 --> 01:05:33.621
- <i>Grazie, grazie.</i>
- Bye-bye.


1090
01:05:38.996 --> 01:05:41.396
I thought you said you
couldn't get pregnant.


1091
01:05:41.398 --> 01:05:43.231
Looks like the doctors
were wrong.


1092
01:05:43.233 --> 01:05:44.599
Whose is it?

1093
01:05:44.601 --> 01:05:46.501
Yours, goddamn it.

1094
01:05:46.503 --> 01:05:48.536
Is that true? Is it really true?

1095
01:05:48.538 --> 01:05:49.704
I swear it.

1096
01:05:53.076 --> 01:05:55.510
Hey, then you must
be thrilled, huh?


1097
01:05:56.513 --> 01:05:57.779
Why do you say that?

1098
01:05:57.781 --> 01:06:01.316
Oh come on, baby, you love
kids, you adore them.


1099
01:06:01.318 --> 01:06:04.085
It's true I adore them.

1100
01:06:05.022 --> 01:06:06.488
- But...
- But what?


1101
01:06:07.657 --> 01:06:10.358
I'm not going
to have this baby.


1102
01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.945
Hold the wire now,
hold on a second.


1103
01:06:13.946 --> 01:06:17.531
I'm going to fly to London. Somebody
told me about a clinic on Harley Street.


1104
01:06:17.534 --> 01:06:19.734
Whoa, whoa, whoa, a second.

1105
01:06:19.736 --> 01:06:23.171
- I have no say in the matter?
- No, I'm afraid not.


1106
01:06:23.173 --> 01:06:25.206
Ava, listen, you can't do this to me.
What are you talking about?


1107
01:06:25.208 --> 01:06:27.208
What are you squawking about?

1108
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:30.345
You have three kids already,
you don't need any more.


1109
01:06:30.347 --> 01:06:32.714
- That ain't for you to decide.
- It sure as hell is.


1110
01:06:32.716 --> 01:06:35.717
It's my insides
we're talking about.


1111
01:06:35.719 --> 01:06:39.154
Have the kid.
I'll help you raise him.


1112
01:06:39.156 --> 01:06:41.790
It's just not the right time
for me to have a child.


1113
01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:46.094
Ava, listen to me. Back when
Nancy and I were on the skids


1114
01:06:46.096 --> 01:06:47.629
before Frank Jr. was born,

1115
01:06:48.832 --> 01:06:50.231
she got pregnant.

1116
01:06:51.401 --> 01:06:52.767
She didn't want to keep it.

1117
01:06:54.137 --> 01:06:56.204
She said the whole
marriage was an abortion.


1118
01:06:57.741 --> 01:06:59.774
I didn't stop her because
I knew she was right.


1119
01:07:01.678 --> 01:07:03.144
Later on, we patched it up.

1120
01:07:04.281 --> 01:07:05.513
My son was born.

1121
01:07:05.515 --> 01:07:09.617
Not a day goes by I don't
think about that baby we lost.


1122
01:07:11.555 --> 01:07:13.221
I need a drink.

1123
01:08:35.672 --> 01:08:36.938
Mmm.

1124
01:08:41.178 --> 01:08:42.944
You know what the problem is?

1125
01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:45.680
- What's the problem?
- We're too much alike.


1126
01:08:45.682 --> 01:08:51.452
We're both selfish,
independent, possessive.


1127
01:08:51.454 --> 01:08:52.554
Anything else?

1128
01:08:54.524 --> 01:08:58.193
How about hot-headed
and competitive?


1129
01:08:59.329 --> 01:09:00.695
And oversexed.

1130
01:09:02.599 --> 01:09:05.266
You're sure as hell
right about that.


1131
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:08.603
Most couple's problems
begin in bed.


1132
01:09:11.975 --> 01:09:13.841
I'm fine with bed.

1133
01:09:14.844 --> 01:09:17.979
My problems begin
on the way to the bidet.


1134
01:09:18.815 --> 01:09:21.816
No, your problems
go back to your childhood.


1135
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:25.520
You were spoiled rotten
by your brothers and sisters.


1136
01:09:25.522 --> 01:09:31.793
Same goes for you,
Lord Fauntleroy of Hoboken, New Jersey.


1137
01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:36.297
But I still love you
more than I do myself.


1138
01:09:37.767 --> 01:09:39.400
I swear it, baby.

1139
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:42.303
Listen Francis,

1140
01:09:43.373 --> 01:09:45.640
this decision is mine alone.

1141
01:09:45.642 --> 01:09:47.375
That means I don't have
any say in the matter?


1142
01:09:47.377 --> 01:09:50.778
Exactly. Mine alone.

1143
01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.779
Is that clear?

1144
01:09:51.781 --> 01:09:52.947
Listen to me,

1145
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:55.650
you go through
with this abortion,


1146
01:09:56.886 --> 01:09:58.586
I'll never speak to you again.

1147
01:09:59.689 --> 01:10:01.956
And I have anything to fucking
do with you ever again.


1148
01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:08.730
It's fucking funny?

1149
01:10:08.732 --> 01:10:10.498
Go away.

1150
01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.500
Oh yeah?

1151
01:10:12.736 --> 01:10:13.801
You want that?

1152
01:10:14.971 --> 01:10:16.504
Fine.

1153
01:10:16.506 --> 01:10:18.473
If anybody asks where I'm going,

1154
01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:21.409
I'll be in Palm Springs

1155
01:10:22.279 --> 01:10:23.611
fucking Lana Turner.

It's all bollocks anyway.


1161
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:15.997
Let me fetch you
something to help you relax.


1162
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.433
Mix me a snack.

1163
01:11:19.469 --> 01:11:20.469
Daniels.

1164
01:11:41.891 --> 01:11:44.375
Are you sure about this, honey?

1165
01:11:44.376 --> 01:11:46.860
Oh Dolly, I can't be in this way.
It would break my mother's heart.


1166
01:11:46.863 --> 01:11:48.813
And the father?

1167
01:11:48.814 --> 01:11:50.764
Sweet talker.
Navy or prison, I'd say.


1168
01:11:57.607 --> 01:11:58.973
My suit from Geismar's.

1169
01:11:58.975 --> 01:12:01.743
Never mind your suit
from Geismar's.


1170
01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.447
You don't come up here
when the door is closed.


1171
01:12:06.449 --> 01:12:07.715
Straighten your tie.

1172
01:12:20.964 --> 01:12:24.699
<i>Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
America, and all the ships at sea. News flash.</i>

1175
01:12:28.872 --> 01:12:34.442
the crooner was reported to be suffering from
a severe case of exhaustion and/or bad press.


1176
01:12:34.444 --> 01:12:36.611
You've got to give
her up, Frank.


1177
01:12:36.613 --> 01:12:38.446
You don't eat, you don't sleep.

1178
01:12:38.448 --> 01:12:41.849
The next dollar you make goes to
the IRS if you ever work again.


1179
01:12:41.851 --> 01:12:45.486
I'm not your mother, Frank,
but this is not marriage.


1180
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:48.990
You're ruining your career
chasing after her.


1181
01:12:49.993 --> 01:12:52.126
It's easy for you to tell
me to give her up.


1182
01:12:54.597 --> 01:12:56.631
You're not the one
in love with her.


1183
01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:58.166
You're lost, Frank.

1184
01:12:58.168 --> 01:13:01.068
Once you lose it in this town,
you never come back.


1185
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:03.905
Even Jesus Christ
couldn't get resurrected here.


1186
01:13:17.587 --> 01:13:19.020
What a waste of my time.

1187
01:13:20.824 --> 01:13:23.624
They should just offer
me the fucking role.


1188
01:13:23.626 --> 01:13:25.493
I was in<i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

1189
01:13:28.665 --> 01:13:30.164
What are you testing for?

1190
01:13:30.166 --> 01:13:33.000
- Maggio.
- Maggio?


1191
01:13:33.002 --> 01:13:35.036
They offered that
part to Eli Wallach.


1192
01:13:35.038 --> 01:13:37.004
That's my point. This
Hollywood, you know...


1193
01:13:37.006 --> 01:13:40.007
Hey, pal, I flew
in from Nairobi for this.


1194
01:13:40.009 --> 01:13:43.611
No one, not even Superman's gonna stop me.
So clam up.


1195
01:13:46.583 --> 01:13:48.115
Mr. Sinatra,

1196
01:13:48.117 --> 01:13:49.917
Zinnemann is ready for you now.

1197
01:13:54.123 --> 01:13:55.223
Your script?

1198
01:13:55.225 --> 01:13:57.258
- Oh, I got it all up here.
- Oh.


1199
01:13:58.495 --> 01:14:00.194
You know, I used to sing too.

1200
01:14:00.196 --> 01:14:02.113
That's nice.

1201
01:14:02.114 --> 01:14:04.031
I still sort of do but
no one really pays me.


1202
01:14:04.033 --> 01:14:05.566
- I know the feeling.
- Huh.


1203
01:14:12.075 --> 01:14:14.642
What are you
looking at, Frankie?


1204
01:14:14.644 --> 01:14:16.177
Looking at you, love.

1205
01:14:32.729 --> 01:14:35.730
When the cat's away,
the rats take over.


1206
01:14:35.732 --> 01:14:39.600
Get out of here, girls, mama's home!
Daddy won't be needing you.


1207
01:14:46.543 --> 01:14:47.875
Oh, Frankie...

1208
01:14:50.013 --> 01:14:52.647
I see you really miss me,
you big slimy snake.


1209
01:14:52.649 --> 01:14:55.917
Darling! I haven't
seen you since Africa.


1210
01:14:55.919 --> 01:14:58.252
Grace Kelly
told me all about it.


1211
01:14:58.254 --> 01:15:01.656
The sweltering heat,
the mud, the mosquitoes.


1212
01:15:01.658 --> 01:15:07.762
Save it, sweetie. We've got a couple of
mosquitoes right here. Some real bloodsuckers.


1213
01:15:11.668 --> 01:15:13.034
Tennis tomorrow?

1214
01:15:14.604 --> 01:15:17.305
Still looking to smack
around some more balls?


1215
01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:21.943
How was it?

1216
01:15:23.146 --> 01:15:25.580
Like old times?

1217
01:15:25.581 --> 01:15:28.015
Do me a favor, don't make
a Taj Mahal of a simple fuck.


1218
01:15:41.064 --> 01:15:42.630
Are you in love with her?

1219
01:15:42.632 --> 01:15:44.332
I'm in love with you,
you green-eyed freak.


1220
01:15:44.334 --> 01:15:46.867
Then why did you jump
her bones again?


1221
01:15:46.869 --> 01:15:49.870
The same reason why you shacked
up with that hunter in<i>Mogambo.</i>


1222
01:15:49.872 --> 01:15:51.205
What are you talking about?

1223
01:15:51.207 --> 01:15:54.041
Oh, don't act stupid, kid.
Doesn't become you.


1224
01:15:59.048 --> 01:16:00.214
Who told you about it?

1225
01:16:00.216 --> 01:16:02.984
You got your spies, I got mine.

1226
01:16:02.986 --> 01:16:05.152
Neither one of us
is marriage material.


1227
01:16:06.389 --> 01:16:09.724
We can't help but jump
into bed with others.


1228
01:16:09.726 --> 01:16:11.859
Stop talking like that.
Stop making trouble.


1229
01:16:11.861 --> 01:16:13.928
Don't try to shut me up.

1230
01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:15.696
You're just afraid
to commit, that's all.


1231
01:16:15.698 --> 01:16:17.131
Look who's talking!

1232
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:27.241
You don't want commitment. You want to dominate
me like all you men do with their women.


1233
01:16:27.243 --> 01:16:30.311
Francis, I will never let you.

1234
01:16:30.313 --> 01:16:33.114
You will never conquer me.

1235
01:16:33.116 --> 01:16:36.984
So, you and your little
playmates can just go fuck off.


1236
01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:40.087
Why don't you crawl back
to the jungle you belong?


1237
01:16:40.089 --> 01:16:42.823
Another word out of you
and I will kick you in the nuts.


1238
01:16:42.825 --> 01:16:44.792
Try it. I'll smash you
right in the face.


1239
01:16:44.794 --> 01:16:49.864
My wife and I,
we were blissfully happy for twenty years.


1240
01:16:49.866 --> 01:16:52.066
And I feel sorry for
people who don't drink.


1241
01:16:53.002 --> 01:16:57.271
When they wake up in the morning,
it's as good as they're gonna feel all day.


1242
01:16:57.273 --> 01:17:00.107
- Is it true what they say?
- It's huge.


1243
01:17:01.177 --> 01:17:04.011
Is there any broad
in here he hasn't fucked?


1244
01:17:05.314 --> 01:17:07.181
He's a son of a bitch.

1245
01:17:07.183 --> 01:17:08.983
There's no one like him.

1246
01:17:10.286 --> 01:17:12.820
I... I didn't...
I really mean that.


1247
01:17:15.425 --> 01:17:16.857
Well, one down.

1248
01:17:16.859 --> 01:17:18.926
They all come out
to see our headliner.


1249
01:17:18.928 --> 01:17:23.264
He used to be big. Direct
from doing a duet with a dog.


1250
01:17:24.701 --> 01:17:29.170
This guy's going places, mostly down.
Ladies and gentlemen, Frank Sinatra!


1251
01:17:33.142 --> 01:17:35.009
Last time you're gonna
see him work in Vegas.


1252
01:17:35.011 --> 01:17:36.011
Where's the dog?

1253
01:17:39.015 --> 01:17:40.347
Where's your wife?

1254
01:17:42.118 --> 01:17:43.784
Where is your fucking wife?

1255
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.981
Oh damn it, break open some
windows, get some air in here!


1256
01:18:13.983 --> 01:18:16.117
Wake up, Frank. 
Frank, wake up.

1257
01:18:16.119 --> 01:18:17.284
Get him on his feet.

1258
01:18:17.286 --> 01:18:18.786
- Get up. Get up.
- Up, up, up.


1259
01:18:18.788 --> 01:18:20.020
We need to call an ambulance?

1260
01:18:20.022 --> 01:18:22.156
No calls. No calls.
No ambulance, no cops.


1261
01:18:22.158 --> 01:18:24.859
Listen, we gotta call the studio.
He's in no shape to do anything.


1262
01:18:24.861 --> 01:18:27.895
After stalling them all night,
they'll never record him again. Frank, Frank!


1263
01:18:27.897 --> 01:18:29.396
Stand up, come on. Stand up.

1264
01:18:29.398 --> 01:18:31.132
Atta boy.

1265
01:18:31.134 --> 01:18:32.967
- Frank!
- Yeah, yeah.


1266
01:18:32.969 --> 01:18:34.235
- There you go.
- He's coming through.


1267
01:18:34.237 --> 01:18:35.903
Breathe, breathe, come on. Yeah.

1268
01:18:35.905 --> 01:18:38.139
- Ava.
- Forget her. Forget Ava.


1269
01:18:38.141 --> 01:18:40.341
She is with Artie.

1270
01:18:40.342 --> 01:18:42.542
Frank, she's not with... look
at me, she's not with Artie.


1271
01:18:42.545 --> 01:18:44.979
Hank checked it out.
She's not with Artie.


1272
01:18:44.981 --> 01:18:47.548
I knocked on the door. She ain't there.
She ain't gonna be there.


1273
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:49.784
He got the message,
that know-it-all prick.


1274
01:18:49.786 --> 01:18:51.952
Frank, you're supposed to be
at the studio, not doing this.


1275
01:18:51.954 --> 01:18:54.088
A billion broads in the world
and you picked the one


1276
01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:56.157
that can take you or leave
you whenever she wants.


1277
01:18:56.159 --> 01:18:59.527
Oh, he's got it bad. And the boy's been
waiting at the studio for him all night.


1278
01:18:59.529 --> 01:19:02.062
Put on a pot of coffee,
we're taking you for a walk. Let's go.


1279
01:19:02.064 --> 01:19:04.064
We ought to call or something.

1280
01:19:05.268 --> 01:19:06.500
- Come on.
- Just walk with us.


1281
01:19:06.502 --> 01:19:07.502
Let's go.

1282
01:19:30.226 --> 01:19:31.226
Frank.

1283
01:19:34.397 --> 01:19:35.963
- What do you got?
- Show him.


1284
01:19:37.934 --> 01:19:41.869
From Billy Roche's shop.
On the arm, of course.


1285
01:19:41.871 --> 01:19:43.037
- They match her eyes.
- Mm-hmm.


1286
01:19:43.039 --> 01:19:44.572
They're not cheap.

1287
01:19:44.574 --> 01:19:47.374
No vig for six months,
but Frank...


1288
01:19:47.376 --> 01:19:49.176
Never mind that.

1289
01:19:49.178 --> 01:19:51.312
Got the other thing?

1290
01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.986
Okay.

1291
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:03.524
She's gonna love this.

1292
01:20:03.526 --> 01:20:04.526
It sings too.

1293
01:20:05.394 --> 01:20:07.194
They're stunning.

1294
01:20:07.196 --> 01:20:10.631
Where'd you get the money
to afford them, for God's sakes?


1295
01:20:10.633 --> 01:20:12.433
Now what kind of
question is that?


1296
01:20:12.435 --> 01:20:15.302
I'm a nosy broad. 
You know that.

1297
01:20:17.306 --> 01:20:20.507
I mean they're real,
aren't they?


1298
01:20:20.509 --> 01:20:23.244
Ey! Nothing fake for my girl.

1299
01:20:26.082 --> 01:20:28.482
Come here! You
like your present?


1300
01:20:28.484 --> 01:20:30.951
No, I hate it.

1301
01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:37.191
You didn't have to.

1302
01:20:38.361 --> 01:20:40.494
I'm just happy being your wife.

1303
01:20:41.631 --> 01:20:43.631
Mrs. Sinatra.

1304
01:20:43.633 --> 01:20:46.333
Mr. Sin-atra.

1305
01:20:56.979 --> 01:20:58.913
I love you, Francis.

1306
01:21:05.154 --> 01:21:07.521
All I ever wanted in the world
was to be a singer.


1307
01:21:09.091 --> 01:21:10.224
Now

1308
01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.459
you're all I want.

1309
01:21:18.968 --> 01:21:24.305
So, Harry, are you sure there isn't anything
in your little old war picture for me?


1310
01:21:24.307 --> 01:21:27.608
I'm sure you recall the performance I
gave the last time we worked together.


1311
01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:30.311
Yes Mercedes, you did good.

1312
01:21:30.313 --> 01:21:33.647
Minna, get me Sinatra on the line
and then give me Eli Wallach.


1313
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:35.549
Well, I did a little
more than good.


1314
01:21:39.488 --> 01:21:41.355
You might have
a point, Mercedes.


1315
01:21:48.297 --> 01:21:52.967
Darling, I have some delicate calls to make.
I'll tell you what.


1316
01:21:52.969 --> 01:21:56.570
We'll read the script together over lunch
and see what we come up with, okay?


1317
01:21:56.572 --> 01:21:59.173
Oh I know we can
come up with something, Harry.


1318
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:02.609
Bye now.

1319
01:22:07.483 --> 01:22:09.750
Another broad with balls.

1320
01:22:09.752 --> 01:22:11.518
I got Mr. Wallach
on the line for you.


1321
01:22:13.622 --> 01:22:14.621
Frank!

1322
01:22:14.623 --> 01:22:17.057
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Frankie baby!


1323
01:22:17.059 --> 01:22:19.626
Maggio was the last
part we cast.


1324
01:22:19.628 --> 01:22:22.296
It was between you
and Eli Wallach.


1325
01:22:22.298 --> 01:22:24.765
He's one hell of an actor.
He tested great.


1326
01:22:24.767 --> 01:22:27.468
That crowd Zinnemann just
plotzed when he saw the reel.


1327
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:29.336
I understand.

1328
01:22:29.338 --> 01:22:31.171
I appreciate
getting the shot.


1329
01:22:31.173 --> 01:22:35.142
Thank me later. Look,
he doesn't look Italian.


1330
01:22:35.144 --> 01:22:36.610
He looks like a Hebe.

1331
01:22:36.612 --> 01:22:38.445
<i>So, we're going with you.</i>

1332
01:22:38.447 --> 01:22:40.581
We're going with you,
you big putz!


1333
01:22:41.484 --> 01:22:44.218
You hear me, boy?
Check, you got the part.


1334
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.355
Get your tush over to Hawaii and start
marching. You're in the army now, son.


1335
01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.060
That was Harry.

1336
01:22:53.696 --> 01:22:55.562
Better pour us a drink.

1337
01:22:55.564 --> 01:22:56.797
Oh, baby!

1338
01:22:59.368 --> 01:23:00.634
Sure thing!

1339
01:23:02.104 --> 01:23:03.637
Better make it champagne.

1340
01:23:04.507 --> 01:23:06.206
Champagne?

1341
01:23:08.477 --> 01:23:13.313
I'm so happy for you.
You got it. You got it!


1342
01:23:15.117 --> 01:23:17.551
I got to go to Hawaii
and learn how to march.


1343
01:23:19.555 --> 01:23:22.456

It's got a script by Joseph Mankiewicz,
the guy who wrote<i>All About Eve.</i>


1351
01:24:02.264 --> 01:24:03.664
Yeah, I know all about him.

1352
01:24:04.567 --> 01:24:06.633
What kind of part
has he written for you?


1353
01:24:06.635 --> 01:24:10.771
I'm supposed to play an
international woman of mystery


1354
01:24:10.773 --> 01:24:13.774
who goes from
dancing in a tango bar


1355
01:24:13.776 --> 01:24:16.610
to marrying one of the richest
men in the world.


1356
01:24:17.513 --> 01:24:21.348
I also get to fuck
every man in sight.


1357
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:22.716
Typecasting!

1358
01:24:22.718 --> 01:24:23.784
Damn you!

1359
01:24:25.187 --> 01:24:27.154
How would you feel if
I walked out on you?


1360
01:24:27.156 --> 01:24:32.159
I'm not walking out. This is my big chance.
This is a pinnacle role for me.


1361
01:24:33.562 --> 01:24:37.531
What about<i>From Here to Eternity?</i>
I need you here by my side, damn it!


1362
01:24:37.533 --> 01:24:38.899
You don't need me.

1363
01:24:38.901 --> 01:24:40.667
Just pick up the phone.

1364
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:43.670
You've got Lana Turner,
Marilyn Maxwell.


1365
01:24:43.672 --> 01:24:45.372
Oh, why are you talking
about Marilyn Maxwell?


1366
01:24:45.374 --> 01:24:48.208
Don't deny it.
Lana Turner told me.


1367
01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:49.543
Lana Turner is a ditz.

1368
01:24:49.545 --> 01:24:54.481
Not too much of a ditz to figure out
what you were doing behind my back.


1369
01:24:56.352 --> 01:24:59.153
All right, so I played around.

1370
01:24:59.155 --> 01:25:01.788
That's just play.
What we got is real.


1371
01:25:02.825 --> 01:25:07.661
How do you know what's real?
You'll fuck anything that moves.


1372
01:25:07.663 --> 01:25:11.331
Well I guess that leaves you out.
You hardly move when we fuck.


1373
01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:13.467
Go to hell, you wop bastard.

1374
01:25:13.469 --> 01:25:15.836
You inbred Baptist ice queen.

1375
01:25:15.838 --> 01:25:20.274
You're nothing but a pair of vocal
cords with a nine-pound cock.


1376
01:25:20.276 --> 01:25:22.209
My pals are right about you.

1377
01:25:22.211 --> 01:25:23.944
They said you'd be
the ruination of me.


1378
01:25:23.946 --> 01:25:29.716
We're perfect replicas of each other.
You're getting just what you deserve.


1379
01:25:29.718 --> 01:25:31.385
Listen to me.

1380
01:25:33.822 --> 01:25:35.372
If you leave to do this film,

1381
01:25:35.373 --> 01:25:37.453
I'll kill myself. I swear
to Christ I'll kill myself!


1382
01:26:23.806 --> 01:26:27.808
You know how many times I called Italy?
Morning, day and night, no answer.


1383
01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:29.843
I'm at the end of my rope.

1384
01:26:29.845 --> 01:26:33.580
Take it easy, Frank.
She's probably just rehearsing.


1385
01:26:33.582 --> 01:26:36.934
She had dinner with Bogie
just the other night.


1386
01:26:36.935 --> 01:26:40.287
I heard she spent the weekend in
Spain with Picasso and Hemingway.


1387
01:26:40.289 --> 01:26:44.992
You know what Frank, that Picasso can
paint some really groovy paintings, man.


1388
01:26:44.994 --> 01:26:46.627
And I mean that, baby.

1389
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:47.661
Who else was she with?

1390
01:26:48.797 --> 01:26:50.864
Uh... Girl, can I get
some Chiclets?


1391
01:26:52.268 --> 01:26:55.702
Frank, you got to stop trying to reach her.
It's driving you crazy.


1392
01:26:55.704 --> 01:26:57.571
You got to concentrate
and focus.


1393
01:26:57.573 --> 01:26:59.573
How is Monty Clift, by the way?

1394
01:26:59.575 --> 01:27:03.810
I heard he trained like a fanatic for
the role, even got you to rehearse.


1395
01:27:03.812 --> 01:27:06.046
Zinnemann worships
the ground he walks on.


1396
01:27:06.048 --> 01:27:08.315
I never met a more
powerful actor. I mean,


1397
01:27:09.451 --> 01:27:11.518
he's taking me to places
I've never been to before.


1398
01:27:12.554 --> 01:27:14.721
Is that the end of
one-shot Sinatra?


1399
01:27:14.723 --> 01:27:16.723
Howard Hughes says
he is a homosexual.


1400
01:27:16.725 --> 01:27:20.294
Oh yeah? Well, he could fuck
sheep as far as I'm concerned.


1401
01:27:20.996 --> 01:27:23.563
What matters to me
is what he gives me on set.


1402
01:27:23.565 --> 01:27:27.601
I mean we work on every scene,
every beat, breakfast, lunch and dinner.


1403
01:27:27.603 --> 01:27:30.304
I mean he's taking me
to a whole other level.


1404
01:27:30.306 --> 01:27:32.506
Who knows? Maybe you'll
win an Academy Award.


1405
01:27:35.477 --> 01:27:38.812
Oh darling, Frank
winning an Oscar!


1406
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:46.353
Oh, speak of the devil.
Howard, how are you darling?


1407
01:27:46.989 --> 01:27:49.323
Well, look who
we have here, Howard.


1408
01:27:50.693 --> 01:27:53.927
I want to get a chair Arte and sit down,
okay? You mind? Thank you.


1409
01:27:54.863 --> 01:27:56.830
Lovely, lovely.

1410
01:27:56.832 --> 01:27:59.499
Here we are, the swooner,

1411
01:27:59.501 --> 01:28:01.635
unhealthy, wartime<i>finale.</i>

1412
01:28:01.637 --> 01:28:03.370
Yesterday's news, right?

1413
01:28:03.372 --> 01:28:04.938
Yes, the war is over in Korea.

1414
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:07.574
Well, what would a draft
dodger know about a war?


1415
01:28:11.113 --> 01:28:13.680
You're a cookie full of
arsenic, aren't you, Lee?


1416
01:28:13.682 --> 01:28:15.982
Well, I take that as
a compliment, Frank.


1417
01:28:15.984 --> 01:28:19.653
Howard, why don't you take your new friend
over to the bar and get a drink on me?


1418
01:28:19.655 --> 01:28:22.889
I didn't come here to have you buy
me a drink. I was hoping to see Ava.


1419
01:28:22.891 --> 01:28:25.509
So where is our little
kitten, Frank?


1420
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:28.128
Why don't you take a long walk off a
short pier, you right-wing creep you?


1421
01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:32.432
Howard, why don't you take it
easy on my friend here?


1422
01:28:32.434 --> 01:28:34.134
Wait, she isn't here, is she?

1423
01:28:34.136 --> 01:28:37.437
She's over in Italy.
Or is it Spain?


1424
01:28:37.439 --> 01:28:40.107
Let's leave the sword play
to Errol Flynn, shall we?


1425
01:28:43.812 --> 01:28:47.514
Would you like me to make
you a movie star, little girl?


1426
01:28:47.516 --> 01:28:51.885
Yes, Mr. Hughes! Make me a big
movie star like Ava Gardner.


1427
01:28:51.887 --> 01:28:57.023
You see, Frank, I could just make another one
but that little Tar Heel got under your skin.


1428
01:28:57.025 --> 01:28:58.792
Why I... you are the...

1429
01:28:58.794 --> 01:29:01.762
Besides, you don't need her.

1430
01:29:01.764 --> 01:29:03.630
You have Montgomery Clift.

1431
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.402
Hold on a second, Howard, my...
my listeners want to know...


1432
01:29:09.104 --> 01:29:10.904
That son of a bitch
called me a queer.


1433
01:29:10.906 --> 01:29:12.172
Frank, if the shoe fits...

1434
01:29:12.174 --> 01:29:13.607
Hey, lay off, Lee.

1435
01:29:13.609 --> 01:29:17.644
I'm exhausted. I must
go wash the stench off.


1436
01:29:19.415 --> 01:29:22.049
Why don't you just beat it, pal?

1437
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:24.684
Frank, you know what I'd like to do? I'd like
to take a picture. Would that be all right?


1438
01:29:24.686 --> 01:29:27.788
Waiter, come on over here and
you know what I want you to do?


1439
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:30.157
I want to get Frank
a bowl of spaghetti.


1440
01:29:30.159 --> 01:29:32.959
I want to... I want to see you
eat the spaghetti, Frank.


1441
01:29:32.961 --> 01:29:35.729
They got nice little Dago
wop that you are.


1442
01:29:35.731 --> 01:29:38.332
You rat...

1443
01:29:38.333 --> 01:29:40.934
Let me go. Let me
go. God damn it! Fucker!


1444
01:29:42.503 --> 01:29:44.069
<i>Operator,
what's the problem?</i>


1445
01:29:44.072 --> 01:29:46.506
I'm trying to reach
this number for days.


1446
01:29:47.509 --> 01:29:48.141
Pavely.

1447
01:29:48.143 --> 01:29:51.812
Well, how do I know? It's
someplace outside of Rome.


1448
01:29:51.814 --> 01:29:53.113
It's United Artists.

1449
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:58.752
How can the phones be out of order?
It's a fucking movie studio.


1450
01:29:58.754 --> 01:30:00.821
Well, watch my language?

1451
01:30:00.823 --> 01:30:03.590
How about this?.

1452
01:30:12.468 --> 01:30:16.603
Of all the gin joints in all the world,
she goes walking into mine.


1453
01:30:17.573 --> 01:30:20.540
Bravo, Frank, Bravo!

1454
01:30:20.542 --> 01:30:25.712
Bogie owns that but
yours had more soul.


1455
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:29.916
Just words on the page, Monty.

1456
01:30:30.853 --> 01:30:32.018
Words on the page.

1457
01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.688
Without soul, they
mean nothing, Frank.


1458
01:30:36.158 --> 01:30:40.794
A character's soul is more
important than the words he speaks.


1459
01:30:41.663 --> 01:30:42.996
I'll drink to that.

1460
01:30:52.674 --> 01:30:55.008
It's all about behavior.

1461
01:30:56.545 --> 01:31:00.180
What goes on behind the eyes.

1462
01:31:01.817 --> 01:31:03.583
Well tell me something,
professor.


1463
01:31:06.622 --> 01:31:08.688
What's going on
behind these eyes?


1464
01:31:11.193 --> 01:31:13.727
I know, Frank. I know.

1465
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:18.031
Your marriage is falling apart,

1466
01:31:18.867 --> 01:31:21.801
the whole world
is crashing down on you,


1467
01:31:21.803 --> 01:31:23.003
it's beating you to death.

1468
01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.873
That's Maggio, Frank.

1469
01:31:28.243 --> 01:31:29.643
Just use it.

1470
01:31:31.079 --> 01:31:34.047
Use all of it.

1471
01:31:36.552 --> 01:31:37.651
It's okay.

1472
01:31:40.255 --> 01:31:42.155
They're gonna send
me to the stockade, Prew?


1473
01:31:42.157 --> 01:31:44.991
No, they ain't gonna
take you to the stockade.


1474
01:31:45.827 --> 01:31:48.762
Watch out for Fatso.
Watch out for Fatso.


1475
01:31:50.198 --> 01:31:52.032
He'll try to crack ya.

1476
01:31:52.034 --> 01:31:55.235
And if they put ya
in a hole, don't yell.


1477
01:31:56.204 --> 01:31:57.671
Don't make a sound.

1478
01:31:57.673 --> 01:32:01.608
You'll still be yellin' when
they come to get ya out.


1479
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:04.644
Just lay there. 
Just lay there.

1480
01:32:06.181 --> 01:32:07.280
And be quiet,

1481
01:32:08.617 --> 01:32:09.716
Prew.

1482
01:33:10.078 --> 01:33:11.078
Hello!

1483
01:33:12.314 --> 01:33:14.180
Yeah operator,
I'll accept the charges.


1484
01:33:15.183 --> 01:33:16.183
Hello, Ava!

1485
01:33:17.152 --> 01:33:18.152
Ava?

1486
01:33:19.421 --> 01:33:20.353
A bullfighter?

1487
01:33:20.355 --> 01:33:21.855
<i>What's his name, damn it?</i>

1488
01:33:21.857 --> 01:33:24.658
Luis Miguel Dominguin,

1489
01:33:25.727 --> 01:33:28.862
the most famous
bullfighter in Spain.


1490
01:33:28.864 --> 01:33:30.997
I suppose he fucks
like a jackrabbit, huh?


1491
01:33:30.999 --> 01:33:35.301
There's no rhyme or reason
to an affair, you know that.


1492
01:33:35.303 --> 01:33:37.804
I suppose when it's all over
you'll come back to me, huh?


1493
01:33:40.909 --> 01:33:42.275
Do you want to come back?

1494
01:33:43.378 --> 01:33:44.878
<i>Olé!</i>

1495
01:33:46.682 --> 01:33:49.683
Oh come on, tiger!

1496
01:33:49.685 --> 01:33:52.686
<i>You've treated lots
of women like dirt.</i>


1497
01:33:52.688 --> 01:33:54.020
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

1498
01:33:55.023 --> 01:33:56.690
<i>Olé!</i>

1499
01:33:57.726 --> 01:33:59.125
<i>Well, what about love?</i>

1500
01:34:01.163 --> 01:34:02.796
<i>Olé!</i>

1501
01:34:02.798 --> 01:34:04.330
My pals were right about you.

1502
01:34:06.034 --> 01:34:09.703
<i>There's a cruelness deep inside
no one can ever reach...</i>


1503
01:34:09.705 --> 01:34:11.004
Your drink, madam.

1504
01:34:11.006 --> 01:34:12.238
<i>Gracias.</i>

1505
01:34:19.247 --> 01:34:21.781
I'm through with you,
you hear me?


1506
01:34:21.783 --> 01:34:25.385
You're staring into
a looking glass, Francis.


1507
01:34:25.387 --> 01:34:27.420
You're seeing
your own reflection.


1508
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:30.156
<i>Olé!</i>

1509
01:35:08.530 --> 01:35:09.896
Snake eyes.

1510
01:35:11.333 --> 01:35:12.999
Story of my life.

1511
01:35:25.547 --> 01:35:29.215
The crooner admitted that he had bruised and
scratched his wrist but laughed off as gossip


1512
01:35:29.217 --> 01:35:31.768
the rumors he had
attempted suicide.


1513
01:35:31.769 --> 01:35:34.320
The tempestuous singer, who recently reached
the parting of ways with Ava Gardner,


1514
01:35:34.322 --> 01:35:37.223
said he did not remember when
or where the accident occurred.


1515
01:35:37.225 --> 01:35:41.094
Frank Sinatra and Ava
Gardner stated today


1516
01:35:41.096 --> 01:35:46.566
that having reluctantly exhausted every
effort to reconcile their differences,


1517
01:35:46.568 --> 01:35:51.971
can find no mutual basis on which
to continue their marriage.


1518
01:35:51.973 --> 01:35:55.408
My heart
bleeds for Frank.


1519

1523
01:36:25.841 --> 01:36:30.009
<i>From Here to Eternity</i>, people are
talking of Sinatra for an Academy Award.


1524
01:36:31.246 --> 01:36:34.364
Rog, it's just a minor role.

1525
01:36:34.365 --> 01:36:37.483
Maybe, but a dead-end kid getting
the podium playing a dead-end kid,


1526
01:36:37.485 --> 01:36:39.886
that could be
a hell of a story, Frank.


1527
01:36:39.888 --> 01:36:43.022
Well, look who's here?
The Judas God in person.


1528
01:36:43.024 --> 01:36:47.026
Why don't you just write it how you sees it?
That's what you guys do anyway.


1529
01:36:47.028 --> 01:36:49.629
Aren't you here against
doctor's orders, Frank?


1530
01:36:49.631 --> 01:36:52.131
What do doctors
know, right, Frank?


1531
01:36:52.133 --> 01:36:53.399
Anything?

1532
01:36:53.401 --> 01:36:54.601
Sorry chief.

1533
01:36:54.603 --> 01:36:57.203
Keep your chin up, Frank.
She'll be back.


1534
01:36:57.205 --> 01:36:59.372
They always come back,
you know that.


1535
01:36:59.374 --> 01:37:01.307
Hurricane Ava?

1536
01:37:01.309 --> 01:37:04.344
I'm sure she wouldn't want
you to hurt the other wrist.


1537
01:37:04.346 --> 01:37:09.249
What are you, a stunod, huh? Frank cut his
hand trying to open a window. End of story.


1538
01:37:09.251 --> 01:37:10.950
What's a stunod?

1539
01:37:10.952 --> 01:37:13.152
It means you got a big mouth.

1540
01:37:13.154 --> 01:37:16.556
And one of these days,
somebody's going to shut it for you. <i>Capisce?</i>


1541
01:37:16.558 --> 01:37:18.224
I'll take that under advisement.

1542
01:37:19.995 --> 01:37:22.495
Listen Frank, tell me the truth.

1543
01:37:22.497 --> 01:37:25.565
Who was it this time?
Hughes? Hemmingway?


1544
01:37:26.635 --> 01:37:29.469
Maybe another bullfighter?

1545
01:37:29.471 --> 01:37:32.071
Now why you got to come up to this
man and say a thing like that?


1546
01:37:32.073 --> 01:37:33.539
Easy champ, easy.

1547
01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:39.345
As a<i>torero</i> you need more
than a cape and fancy footwork


1548
01:37:39.347 --> 01:37:41.681
to escape Ava Gardner,
isn't that right, Frank?


1549
01:37:41.683 --> 01:37:44.134
Why don't you button
it up huh, Walter?


1550
01:37:44.135 --> 01:37:46.586
Yeah, I'll button it up.
I'll button it up if you face the music.


1551
01:37:46.588 --> 01:37:50.623
We all know who wears the pants,
who pays the rent, but she is not here.


1552
01:37:50.625 --> 01:37:53.026
Enough of your bullshit.
Joe, get him out of here.


1553
01:37:53.028 --> 01:37:55.528
Mr. Winchell, you're going to
force me to make a comeback.


1554
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:57.297
Hey wait, don't put
your hands on me.


1555
01:37:57.299 --> 01:37:59.032
Come on, get him out of here.

1556
01:37:59.034 --> 01:38:02.035
Oh wait, Frank, Frank,
good luck at the Oscars.


1557
01:38:02.037 --> 01:38:06.239
I hear they're even putting it on television.
Isn't that something? First time.


1558
01:38:09.177 --> 01:38:10.944
Why do you even
talk to that creep?


1559
01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.347
Remember Lucky?
He talked to him.


1560
01:38:14.349 --> 01:38:17.450
You know what he got? The chair.
The chair, that's what he got.


1561
01:38:19.287 --> 01:38:23.690
It hurts, Hank, 'cause
I got a big hole right here.


1562
01:38:23.692 --> 01:38:25.291
I just can't hide it anymore.

1563
01:38:25.293 --> 01:38:29.329
Then don't hide it.
Use the pain. Sing from there.


1564
01:38:29.331 --> 01:38:31.164
Happy songs are bullshit anyway.

1565
01:38:35.203 --> 01:38:36.469

1573

Nancy, please, huh?
Make me a few ravioli.


1574
01:39:29.324 --> 01:39:31.724
Don't they feed you
at the Academy Awards?


1575
01:39:33.128 --> 01:39:35.762
I know, Frankie
misses home cooking.


1576
01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:40.666
So, you're nervous?

I'm just happy to be there.

1579
01:39:45.173 --> 01:39:47.040
You know, they nominated
a lot of heavyweights:


1580
01:39:47.042 --> 01:39:50.810
Bill Holden, Audrey
Hepburn, Monty Clift.


1581
01:39:50.812 --> 01:39:54.213
So, what about your African
Queen? Isn't she nominated?


1582
01:39:54.215 --> 01:39:58.518
Oh wait! The paper says
she's not coming. What was it?


1583
01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:00.153
Bullfighting.

1584
01:40:00.155 --> 01:40:01.754
Cliché.

1585
01:40:01.756 --> 01:40:03.756
Now don't overcook
the ravioli, will you?


1586
01:40:10.432 --> 01:40:14.067
You're going to make a mess of yourself.
When are you going to learn?


1587
01:40:16.137 --> 01:40:17.537
Your kids are here.

1588
01:40:20.141 --> 01:40:22.708
Hey! Angel.

1589
01:40:22.710 --> 01:40:25.411
See how nice daddy looks
for the Academy Awards?


1590
01:40:25.413 --> 01:40:26.746
Are you going to win
an Academy Award?


1591
01:40:26.748 --> 01:40:28.548
Not so fast, cupcake.

Seven, seven.

1595
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:38.458
Snake eyes. Story of my life.

1596
01:40:39.727 --> 01:40:41.561
So, you need a date
for the Oscar's?


1597
01:40:48.736 --> 01:40:53.739
Nominees for the best performance
by an actor in a supporting role


1598
01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:58.277
are Eddie Albert in<i>Roman
Holiday</i>, Paramount.


1599
01:40:59.881 --> 01:41:02.348
Do you remember
he gave us the TV set?


1600
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:04.817
Yeah, what if he's going
to mention my name, huh.


1601
01:41:04.819 --> 01:41:07.120
Oh, I hope he does.

01:41:35.283 --> 01:41:37.683
We had him in our jail.

1608
01:41:40.488 --> 01:41:44.357
Yeah, he's alright.
He's a good guy actually.


1609
01:41:44.359 --> 01:41:46.425
He won! Give me the money.

1610
01:41:47.462 --> 01:41:49.328
You got it, Frankie boy!

1611
01:41:50.165 --> 01:41:51.264
That's it.

1612
01:41:52.867 --> 01:41:55.168
- Don't ever doubt Frank. Let's go.
- I won't doubt Frank.


1613
01:42:12.287 --> 01:42:13.419
Hey Mac!

1614
01:42:14.956 --> 01:42:16.522
Mac, you all right?

1615
01:42:20.195 --> 01:42:21.260
I'm all right, pal.

1616
01:42:23.264 --> 01:42:24.497
Oh, yeah?

1617
01:42:25.667 --> 01:42:28.701
Could sure use a nightcap.

1618
01:42:28.702 --> 01:42:31.736
Yeah never mind that.
What do you think you're doing out here?


1619
01:42:31.739 --> 01:42:33.239
She's gone.

1620
01:42:34.842 --> 01:42:36.826
No show.

1621
01:42:36.827 --> 01:42:38.811
Who... who's gone?
Who are you talking about?


1622
01:42:38.813 --> 01:42:39.912
The girl,

1623
01:42:41.549 --> 01:42:42.648
you know.

1624
01:42:43.685 --> 01:42:45.851
Can't stay together,
can't stay apart.


1625
01:42:45.853 --> 01:42:47.553
You know how that
works, don't you pal?


1626
01:42:47.555 --> 01:42:50.489
No, what I know
is that you're drunk.


1627
01:42:50.491 --> 01:42:53.960
You've been drinking and you're sitting here
on private property, that's what I know.


1628
01:42:53.962 --> 01:42:57.964
By the way, what is this thing? How'd you
get a hold of that? Who does that belong to?


1629
01:42:58.866 --> 01:43:01.751
Would you believe little old me?

1630
01:43:01.752 --> 01:43:04.637
Oh yeah, how does a fellow like you
get a hold of a thing like that huh?


1631
01:43:04.639 --> 01:43:05.738
Behavior.

1632
01:43:06.908 --> 01:43:08.941
It's what goes
on behind the eyes.


1633
01:43:08.943 --> 01:43:11.944
What do you got, Josenhans?

1634
01:43:11.945 --> 01:43:14.946
He's a vagrant, publicly intoxicated,
possibly stolen goods.


1635
01:43:14.949 --> 01:43:16.415
What do you got here?

1636
01:43:16.417 --> 01:43:18.251
Who is he calling a vagrant?

1637
01:43:20.855 --> 01:43:22.321
Congratulations!

1638
01:43:22.323 --> 01:43:26.592
You had a great night tonight, huh?
Come on, pal.


1639
01:43:26.594 --> 01:43:29.795
What do you say we give you a
lift to wherever you want to go?


1640
01:43:29.797 --> 01:43:32.565
What do you think, huh?
Up you go. That's it.


1641
01:43:33.801 --> 01:43:35.334
There you go.

1642
01:43:39.274 --> 01:43:40.640
A big day tomorrow!

1643
01:43:42.543 --> 01:43:44.577
Sarge, he's a friend of yours?

1644
01:43:44.579 --> 01:43:46.612
It's Frank Sinatra.

1645
01:43:46.614 --> 01:43:48.447
- The singer?
- Yeah!


1646
01:43:48.449 --> 01:43:50.449
- What, that guy?
- Yeah, the actor.


1647
01:43:50.451 --> 01:43:52.118
No kidding.

1648
01:43:52.119 --> 01:43:53.786
Yeah he just
won the Academy Award.


1649
01:43:53.787 --> 01:43:55.454
It was on television and
everything. You didn't see it?


1650
01:43:55.456 --> 01:43:59.392
No. He kept
talking about some girl.


1651
01:43:59.394 --> 01:44:03.062
Yeah. If you've been
in this job as long as I have,


1652
01:44:03.064 --> 01:44:06.499
you always find that there's a
girl at the end of the story.


1653
01:44:06.501 --> 01:44:08.067
Especially with a guy like that.

1654
01:44:09.637 --> 01:44:11.037
Frank Sinatra.

1655
01:44:11.039 --> 01:44:14.907
<i>I'm... I'm terribly pleased
and if I start thanking everybody,</i>


1656
01:44:14.909 --> 01:44:18.077
<i>I'll do a one reeler
up here so I better not.</i>


1657
01:44:18.079 --> 01:44:19.445
<i>And</i>

1658
01:44:19.447 --> 01:44:24.317
<i>I'd just like to say, however, that
they're doing a lot of songs here tonight</i>


1659
01:44:24.319 --> 01:44:25.751
<i>but nobody asked me.</i>

1660
01:44:27.522 --> 01:44:31.657
<i>I love you though.
Thank you very much. I'm absolutely thrilled.</i>


1661
01:45:27.949 --> 01:45:29.782
Okay, boys,

1662
01:45:29.784 --> 01:45:31.684
let's make a record.

1663
01:45:31.686 --> 01:45:34.620
One, two, three, four.

1664
01:45:36.090 --> 01:45:39.859
Yeah, baby! He's still got it.
Yeah he's got it.


1665
01:45:40.728 --> 01:45:42.962
Yeah, go with it, Frank.

1666
01:45:42.964 --> 01:45:49.635
Howard Hughes really used his influence
to turn the press against Frank Sinatra.


1667
01:45:49.637 --> 01:45:52.705
Ava Gardner had
a sense of irony.


1668
01:45:52.707 --> 01:45:54.173
She was very intelligent.

1669
01:45:54.175 --> 01:45:56.542
And in her own way,
she was very principled.


1670
01:45:56.544 --> 01:45:58.010
She never said
she was a nun.


1671
01:45:58.012 --> 01:46:00.980
And she was very, very
much her own person.


1672
01:46:00.982 --> 01:46:04.984
You know, she was not one of these
people who said a man can run my life.


1673
01:46:04.986 --> 01:46:09.455
That was not who she was.
Frank wanted to run her life.


1674
01:46:09.457 --> 01:46:12.124
I knew Ava Gardner well like
a lot of people knew her well.


1675
01:46:12.126 --> 01:46:14.860
I wasn't the only one,
many people knew her well.


1676
01:46:14.862 --> 01:46:18.998
She was out and about and around and
making it here and making it there.


1677
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.969
The only time I ever really, really, really
saw Frank happy was when he was on stage.


1678
01:46:23.971 --> 01:46:27.540
He was an amazing singer,
no question about it.


1679
01:46:27.542 --> 01:46:30.943
And he turned out to be
a pretty good actor too.


1680
01:46:30.945 --> 01:46:33.546
Everything that he
ever did, I watched.


1681
01:46:33.548 --> 01:46:38.217
Every album he ever made, I had.
I adored his voice and adored him.


1682
01:46:38.219 --> 01:46:40.820
And I mean after all
he was Frank Sinatra.


1683
01:46:40.822 --> 01:46:45.958
I mean there was nobody bigger or more
charming and those blue eyes and that smile.


1684
01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:53.065
I'm ninety-three years old and I can
still smell Ava Gardner's perfume.
