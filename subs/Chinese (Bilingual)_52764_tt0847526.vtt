261
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.953
是啊  但可能是仿製品
Yeah, that could be a replica.


262
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.999
這是一隻38口徑的搶
This is a .38 snubnose.


263
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.152
特別是週六晚上

相信我  粗魯的男孩
Trust me, rude boy.


268
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.715
你把簡單的事情搞複雜了
You're making something simple very complicated.


269
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.189
-我可是個神槍手  兄弟  -給我看看槍就行了
-I'm a marksman, bruv. -just show me the gun.


270
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.957

-lf l like what l see, l'll pay you. -l'm an assassin.

274
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.156
只要我一走  你就能
As soon as l've left, you can...


275
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.949
你就可以到這兒的煙館去  抽上一整盒
You can run down the local drug den, you can blow the whole lot.


276
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.031
怎麼樣?
Huh?


277
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.510
-把錢放在桌上  老兄  -哦  別這樣
-money on the table, bruv. -oh, come on.


278
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:38.392
別這樣  我看起來像會了槍打你嗎
Come on, do l look like l'm about to take the gun and shoot you?


279
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.552
不  不  你不會
No. no, you don't.


280
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.718
但那不是你要問你自己的問題
But that's not the question you should be asking yourself.


281
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.598
事實上
Fact is...


282
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.797
我看起來像要射你的人嗎  像嗎
Do l look like l'm about to shoot you? hm?


283
00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.634
像嗎
Uh?


284
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.351
你幹嘛要以貌取人呢  有錢人
Why don't you judge me on the way l look, rich man?


285
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.956
我可是個嗜血的煙鬼
I'm a bloodclot crackhead.


286
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.635
也就是說我是個危險人物
Which means l'm a dangerous man to know.


287
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.790
你笑什麼
What you laughing at?


288
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.033
你他媽究竟在笑什麼
What the fuck are you laughing at, man?


289
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.595
我向上帝發誓  不要試探我  知道嗎  有錢人
I swear to god, don't test me, you know, rich man.


290
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.793
知道嗎  老兄  我已經殺了很多人了
Oi, I've killed nuff people, you know, blud.


291
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.160
滾回你的地盤  要知道你和個攜搶的煙鬼
Now, you just move back to where you come from, with the knowledge that


292
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.189
起了點小摩擦  竟然還能活著離開
You just had a little brush with a gun-toting crackhead and you lived.


293
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.352
聽懂啦
Yeah?


294
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.116
把錢放在桌上  給我滾出去
Put your money on the table and get the fuck out.

你他媽的同性戀

306
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.918
上帝啊  迪  把那小東西收好
For fuck's sake, d, put that wee thing away.


307
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.673
霍斯!

308
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.714

309
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.474
還好嗎
Fine?


310
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.154
那他媽的是誰?
Who the fuck is that?


311
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.675
你從什麼時候起開始當鴨了

你從什麼時候起開始當鴨了

You didn't tell me because you owe me money, you little fucking crackhead.


319
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.630
你他媽的欠我錢
You owe me fucking money!


320

323
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.476
要是在走之前再看到你
If l see you before I've gone,


324
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.916
我會他媽毀了你的
I'll fucking ruin you.


325
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.196
同性戀
Gaybo.


326
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.996
霍斯  兄弟  輕點  輕點

You don't go picking up some gaybo pervert off the street


338
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.831
你竟然隨便把個變態同性戀給帶回來了
Three weeks after what we've done.


339
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.277

About your money? the money that l owe you?


354

Hoods, listen. I'm trying to get your money but things are just way out...

And you come over last night, and then by this morning it's gone?

I ain't taken the gun, you ain't taken it,


552
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.360

"但還有人送我香水"
But l got some wicked perfume on, boy''.


616
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.310
是不是就是她被殺了?

I swear. you know, in fact, what are you still doing here, man?


620
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:27.313
你覺得被女人拋棄了  自己好像個小丑嗎
What? you feel like a prick cause your pride's been dented?


621
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.311
你覺得這事不可能發生在你身上
You didn't think it could happen to you!


622
00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.392

我不能繼續走下去
You...can't...just...move...on!


627
00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:50.114
你可以  你老婆出走根本不能與我經歷的事相比
You can! your wife leaving you ain't shit compared to what l've been through.


628
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.875
-我和那個女人有個女兒  -這理由不錯
- l had a daughter with that woman! - that's a better reason.


629
00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.191
不過就這理由來說  你就更不該
That's an even better reason for you to not want this...


630
00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.558
要這個東西  你有個女兒啊

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.593
她不是我的女兒  她不是我的女兒
She isn't my little girl. she isn't my little girl!


633
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.148
現在你懂了沒
Now do you understand?!


634
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.668
兩年了
Two years.


635
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:42.715
兩年來  我一直以為我是她的爸爸
Two fucking years l spent thinking l was her dad.


636
00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.678
現在卻發現我不是
And then l find out l'm not.


637
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.158
整整兩年了
Two fucking years!


638
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.349
別人才是她的爸爸
Some other fucker is.


639
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.272
那個人我認識
Someone l know.


640
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.113
我竟然認識他
Ohh, l fucking know him.


641
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.159
我竟然認識那個男人
I fucking know him!


642
00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.673
最後我老婆為了他離開了我
And then my wife leaves me for him.


643
00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.632
你知道那是什麼感覺嗎
Do you want to know how that feels?


644
00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.875
我...  她是我女兒  她卻不是我親生的
I'm her...it's my daughter. she's not even mine.


645
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.114
我輾轉難寐
I'm lying awake at night.


646
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.397
我看完我以前日記
I'm going through my old diaries. l'm...


647
00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:24.270
我想知道到底什麼時候開始的  我瘋了吧
I'm trying to figure out when it all began. l'm going out of my fucking mind...


648
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.589
操
Ohhh, shit.


649
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.592
給你  兄弟
Here you are, man.


650
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.638
有錢人  給你
Rich man, 'ere you are.


651
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.638
拿著  夥計  這是你的
Take it, blud. lt's yours. yeah?


652
00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.832
我知道你生氣的原因了
Look, l hear your beef and that.


653
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.516
我知道你生氣的原因了  我明白的
I hear your beef, like, l understand.


654
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.353
但用槍  夥計
But this gun ting, man.


655
00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.432
這可絕不是什麼好辦法
It...it just ain't the way.


656
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:22.031
兄弟  你得學著怎麼來應對這爛事
Bruv, you...you just gotta learn... you gotta learn how to deal with this shit,


657
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:25.795
向前看 對吧
And move on. yeah?


658
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.868
我挺過來了
I moved on.


659
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.233
千萬不要孩子氣
Never had no childhood.


660
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.551
我從十歲起就在孤兒院
I...l was in a children's home since l was ten.


661
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.554
那時只有我和我媽媽  兄弟
It was just me and my mum, blud.


662
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:51.713
嗯  她幹得可真是不錯
Well, she obviously did a great job.


663
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.070
-對不起  -你剛才說什麼
- l'm sorry. - what did you just say?


664
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.312
-你剛才說了什麼  -我不是有意的  只是...
- what did you say? huh? - l didn't mean it. l just...


665
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.234
-只是順口說說  對不起  -我媽媽盡了力
- lt just came out. l'm sorry. - my mum did the best job she could!


666
01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.393
我會到孤兒院的唯一原因是她死了
The only reason l was in the children's home was 'cause she died.


667
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.994
想想我的感受
Think about how l felt.


668
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.118
被丟到了孤兒院
Dumped in a children's home.


669
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.078
沒有爸爸  媽媽也死了
No dad. dead mum.


670
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.356
我十歲的時候就完了
Even at the age of ten l was fucked!


671
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.911
為什麼我現在成這樣了  因為我的過去
That's why l'm here now! that's why! 'cause of my past!


672
01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.231
而你  你是我見過的最有權勢的人
Look at y... you're the most privileged person l've ever met!


673
01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.994
-他媽的  -聽著  我不...

不  不  不
No. no, no, no, no.


675
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.515
操你媽  操你媽
Fuck you! fuck you!


676
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.236
如果你的人生和我一樣  你也不過是個煙鬼
If you lived my life, you'd be the same crackhead as me!


677
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.872
如果我有你的人生  即使我知道  也不會這樣
If l lived your life, blud, if l knew what l knew, l wouldn't be you.


678
01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.708
你他媽個癮君子  你他媽個賤人
You fucking battie-boy crackhead! you fucking prick!

Cause if you never came up to me asking for a gun last night,

天哪  麥克  鸚鵡又不在窗台上
Fuck's sake, michael. the parrot ain't even in the window.

你有錢  所以你可以活下去

你覺得你就可以離開了嗎?
Then do you reckon you'd be able to leave?


766

那你是什麼意思?
So what are you saying?


772
01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.074
他幹嘛到處找這把槍呢?
Why's he looking for the gun?


773
01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.994
為什麼他這麼急著找這把槍  啊?
Why's he want the gun back so badly? hm?

777
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.428
所以  如果這把槍落到警察手裡呢?
So? what would happen if the police got hold of it?


778
01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.876
我不會把槍給警察的
l ain't handing it in to no feds.


779
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.917
把槍還給我
Just give me the gun back.


780
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:54.197
我可沒說要把它交給警察
I'm not suggesting...l'm not suggesting we hand it in.


781
01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.875
那你到底什麼意思?
So what you saying then, man?

784
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.356
拿著槍去勒索他嗎
You want to sell him his own gun back?


785

赫萊西奧  赫萊西奧
Horatio. Horatio.


786

他不會買自己的槍的  夥計
You don't sell hoodwink his own gun, blud.


787
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.478
幹嘛不?
Huh, huh. why not?


788
01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.312
因為你不能
Cause you don't.


789
01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.074
-為什麼  -因為他是個殺手
- why not? - ah, 'cause he's a killer.


790

操你老娘
Motherfucker!


794
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.075
你憑什麼說他花錢拿回槍後
Hm... what's gonna stop him from... from buying the gun off you


795
01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.356
不會一槍斃了你

我會把子彈取下來的
I'll take the bullets out.


798
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.316
他只是要槍  又不要子彈
He only wants the gun. he doesn't want the bullets.


799
01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.519

滾開  把槍放到地上  然後滾開
Get out. just put the gun down on the floor and get out.


819
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.309
我和你可沒什麼瓜葛  同性戀
Cause l ain't got no beef with you, gaybo.

874
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.958
和講好的不一樣
It's not what you said to me.


875
01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.868
可你想想  迪  布萊妮當時在威脅我
For fuck's sake, d. briony, she was... she was threatening me, right?


876
01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.918

She stole money off me, she threatened to go to the feds.


877
01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.312
她要勒索我  你讓我怎麼辦  我都快有孩子了

881
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.355
她是個不要臉的賤婆娘
She was a wee crackhead whore.


882
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.273
為了白粉她能跟男人上床
And she sucked cock for rock.


883
01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.071
是我的錯
It's my fault, man.


884
01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.518
我把她引到地下室
I coaxed her down into the basement.


885
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.916
他就在那兒等著

我以為他只是嚇嚇她而已
I thought...l thought he was just gonna scare her, man.


887
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.829
他該死的說話不算數
He fucking lost it.


888
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.435
接著他就發瘋了  殺了她
He just went fucking mental, man. he shot her.


889
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.755
就這麼一槍殺了她

I can see her eyes, man. when she was laying on the floor.

911
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.152
只有她的眼睛在說話
She had the look in her eyes.


912
01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.508
她說  "為什麼  迪"

你得聽著  殺人什麼好處都沒有
Shooting someone ain't gonna bring nothing but badness.


916

我沒想過要殺人

919

我只想殺了我自己

920

為什麼  赫萊西奧
