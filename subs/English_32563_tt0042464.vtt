00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.450
"We set this, our bond, in writing...

2
00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:54.079
so that all good men will know
our reason and our purpose.


3
00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:56.665
From this night forward,
we will not rest...


4
00:01:56.832 --> 00:02:01.586
until we have gathered the strength
to free ourselves of the invader."


5
00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:04.631
If we are agreed...

6
00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.595
then we better be starting back
to our homes.


7
00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:17.644
Brave talk from old men.
Where are the young ones tonight?


8
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:22.441
I'm frightened. Frightened for us all,
young and old.


9
00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:54.306
- Dardo.
- Dardo.


10
00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.856
Hey, Bambino. Look who's coming.

11
00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:05.025
Dardo.

12
00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.866
- We didn't expect you until next week.
- I'll meet you at the tavern.


13
00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:15.077
Dardo wouldn't miss
the Hawk's homecoming.


14
00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:17.371
Dardo, shoot a cap.

15
00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:20.916
- Caps ready?
- Yeah.


16
00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:22.709
Let's go.

17
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.839
Further back.

18
00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:31.510
All right, caps in the air.

19
00:03:33.303 --> 00:03:35.555
- Whose hat did you pick?
- Fat Tony's.


20
00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:38.725
I know why, I've seen his sister.

21
00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:40.686
Dardo.

22
00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:44.731
Papa Pietro.

23
00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:46.692
We missed you at the meeting, Dardo.

24
00:03:46.858 --> 00:03:49.361
Signor Apothecary,
you sound like his wife.


25
00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.905
I'll leave the talking to you.
You're good at it.


26
00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:53.865
We need you.
We're depending on you.


27
00:03:54.032 --> 00:03:57.536
On me? Why? I don't depend on anyone,
why should anyone depend on me?


28
00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:00.205
- Right, Rudi?
- A man of the mountains has to learn...


29
00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:02.833
that he can't depend on anyone
but himself.


30
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.711
- There, you see?
- He's your own true son, Dardo.


31
00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:08.213
Each for himself
and devil take the hindmost.


32
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.550
Drink at the tavern with your own kind
the day the Hawk comes back.


33
00:04:11.758 --> 00:04:13.594
Let the rest take care of themselves.

34
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.887
Apothecary, the herbs for your cures.

35
00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:18.223
But don't try curing me. 
I'm incurable.

36
00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:21.602
- Where's Alberto working today?
- The Vasselis.


37
00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:23.353
Rudi.

38
00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:26.440
Do you think
you can hit that chimney?


39
00:04:26.607 --> 00:04:29.818
- It's an awful long way away.
- Go on, try it.


40
00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:31.987
Pull it back close to your cheek.

41
00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:33.947
Aim low, now.

42
00:04:36.742 --> 00:04:40.454
- I hit it. I hit it.
- You certainly did.


43
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:44.416
Hey, what dirty-faced, son-of-toilet...
Dardo.


44
00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.585
Benuto. Giovanni.

45
00:04:46.793 --> 00:04:49.254
He's here again.
I'll meet you at the tavern.


46
00:04:49.463 --> 00:04:52.174
It's true. The apothecary
talks too much sometimes.


47
00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:53.592
But this time, he's right.

48
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.678
We just have to do something
about the Hawk.


49
00:04:56.887 --> 00:04:58.096
You there, Dardo Bartoli.

50
00:04:58.305 --> 00:05:01.642
Do you think people are made of money
to go buy new caps everyday?


51
00:05:01.808 --> 00:05:04.811
And besides,
I haven't seen you in four weeks.


52
00:05:04.978 --> 00:05:07.105
Women just don't understand,
do they, Tony?


53
00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:09.650
Here, take my cap for the boy.

54
00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:11.902
I'll get it back tonight.

55
00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.322
What's it going to be like
if we let the Hawk back...


56
00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:18.450
Why don't you let me alone?
A man can live his life two ways:


57
00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:20.202
- With or without.
- Without what?


58
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.454
- Rudi, tell him.
- What?


59
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:25.874
- People and things.
- People get you into things...


60
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:27.834
things get you into trouble...

61
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.337
trouble gets you mixed up
into people.


62
00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:33.548
- Then it starts all over again.
- My son.


63
00:05:33.715 --> 00:05:36.218
Now, come on,
let's have some of Giulio's good wine.


64
00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:38.470
- Can we all hang out?
- Dardo, what's up?


65
00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:41.515
- Are we all here? The butcher?
- Hey, Giulio, the wine.


66
00:05:41.682 --> 00:05:43.850
- The tinker.
- Bring out some wine.


67
00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:45.477
Where's Piccolo?

68
00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:47.854
Well, where's Piccolo?

69
00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:50.649
I can't drink without Piccolo.

70
00:05:56.697 --> 00:05:59.449
Hey, Piccolo, what's the matter?
Didn't you hear us?


71
00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:08.458
Have you stopped drinking?
Are you sick?


72
00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:10.711
What's on your mind?

73
00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:19.094
Oh, the Hawk's coming.

74
00:06:28.604 --> 00:06:32.274
- Run along. I wanna talk to Piccolo.
- We're not afraid of the Hawk, are we?


75
00:06:32.482 --> 00:06:36.028
Run along and teach those city kids
some mountain manners. Now, come on.


76
00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:40.365
You're not worried about the Hawk.
It's the boy's mother.


77
00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:43.201
Look, I've told you before.
I'm through with all that.


78
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.412
It's been five years
since she went away.


79
00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:47.873
Every man's wife leaves him sooner
or later...


80
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.791
only some don't take their bodies.

81
00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.543
Now, forget it. I have.

82
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.380
I just thought the boy ought to see
the Hawk, that's all. So come on.


83
00:06:55.547 --> 00:06:57.424
Well, come on.

84
00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:11.271
When you come to it, Francesca was
the only satisfactory woman I knew.


85
00:07:11.438 --> 00:07:13.523
She left me alone.

86
00:07:14.816 --> 00:07:16.610
Lucretia.

87
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:20.739
I don't know which gives more pleasure,
kissing or hitting you.


88
00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:22.616
"Don't move until I come back."

89
00:07:22.783 --> 00:07:25.285
A girl could starve
waiting for you to come back.


90
00:07:25.452 --> 00:07:27.120
I'll see you tonight.

91
00:07:27.287 --> 00:07:30.916
Tell Giulio we'll have a keg of wine,
a ham, chickens from the spit...


92
00:07:31.124 --> 00:07:33.335
another keg of wine
and six yards of bread.


93
00:07:33.543 --> 00:07:37.172
- This fellow says he won't serve us.
- Oh, you won't?


94
00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:40.592
Dardo, we're closed.
The Hawk is coming.


95
00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:45.347
Dardo, the north bell is ringing
and the Hawk is already in the city.


96
00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:47.641
Do you serve us wine
or do we take it...


97
00:07:47.808 --> 00:07:50.435
- and leave the money on your chest?
- Dardo.


98
00:07:50.644 --> 00:07:53.480
You come here. And you too, Pietro.

99
00:07:53.647 --> 00:07:57.317
Pietro, your wife wants us.
Lucretia, get the food.


100
00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:02.823
Clear the square.

101
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.534
Nonna Bartoli, what's the harm
in a little drink?


102
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.120
At your age, Pietro,
it only takes a little drink.


103
00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:10.872
I might have known you would be here.
Why did you come?


104
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:12.499
To see your beautiful eyes.

105
00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:15.168
I know you
since you were no bigger than Rudi.


106
00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:18.839
I know that mouth. You've come
looking for trouble and I don't like it.


107
00:08:19.006 --> 00:08:21.800
- Why did you have to bring the boy?
- To meet the Hawk.


108
00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:25.178
For the boy's sake, let it be.
There's no reason he has to know.


109
00:08:25.345 --> 00:08:27.180
- Would any of us tell?
- Not one.


110
00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:30.017
Rudi's my son, Nonna.
We don't lie to each other.


111
00:08:30.225 --> 00:08:32.978
What good can it do him
to know his mother?


112
00:08:33.186 --> 00:08:35.105
Rudi.

113
00:08:44.197 --> 00:08:48.910
Make way for Ulrich, count of Hesse.

114
00:09:15.646 --> 00:09:17.356
Come. I want you to meet someone.

115
00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:20.525
- Who is he?
- Dardo.


116
00:09:20.692 --> 00:09:23.862
My uncle's indiscretions
come back on him.


117
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.700
Rudi, I want you
to know your mother.


118
00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:31.244
There she is.

119
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:33.246
I want you to look at her...

120
00:09:33.413 --> 00:09:36.041
so you'll never feel
you missed anything.


121
00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:39.920
Now you'll know what people
are talking about if they make remarks.


122
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:45.384
That's Count Ulrich, the Hawk, the man
she went away with five years ago.


123
00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:48.220
So you see,
there's no real reason to hate her...


124
00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:50.180
just pity her for bad judgment.

125
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:54.059
As for him, I suppose you can pity a man
who has to buy a woman...


126
00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:56.728
to keep from living with himself.

127
00:09:57.437 --> 00:09:59.398
We better start back
to the mountains.


128
00:09:59.606 --> 00:10:01.817
One moment, please.

129
00:10:01.984 --> 00:10:05.779
I'm surprised to find
you're still so foolhardy, Dardo.


130
00:10:05.946 --> 00:10:09.825
I'm sure you're not so simple to think
I'd use the authority of the empire...


131
00:10:09.992 --> 00:10:12.953
to answer an outraged husband.

132
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.289
You killed the falcon.

133
00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:18.125
Perhaps you don't know
the noble sport of falconry...


134
00:10:18.292 --> 00:10:20.585
is regulated and protected
by imperial law.


135
00:10:20.794 --> 00:10:23.672
By mountain law, any hawk
is fair game for a hunter's arrow.


136
00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:26.592
Yes, I am familiar
with that mountain law...


137
00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:28.844
and I know exactly what you mean.

138
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.305
However, I am...

139
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:34.141
shall we say,
on the side of the hawk...


140
00:10:34.308 --> 00:10:37.019
and extremely jealous of the safety
of my birds.


141
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:38.854
Your hawks are safe...

142
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:41.982
as long as they don't hunt
in my part of the mountains.


143
00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:44.651
And just which is your part
of the mountains?


144
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.197
My niece asks
a most pertinent question, Dardo.


145
00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:53.785
- Whichever part I'm in, milady.
- That covers a great deal of territory.


146
00:10:53.994 --> 00:10:56.747
- So do I.
- You there, Rudi.


147
00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:01.293
- What am I going to do with your father?
- Nothing. You better not.


148
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.212
He makes it difficult to stay patient.

149
00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:07.841
We can't have everyone deciding
the hawk is fair game, now, can we?


150
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.552
Do you think I should
make an example of Dardo?


151
00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:12.304
- No.
- No?


152
00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:14.848
Well, then, I think you can help.

153
00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:18.310
I shall invite you
to live with your mother at the castle.


154
00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:19.978
I'm sure she wants that.

155
00:11:20.187 --> 00:11:23.899
And I believe it will guarantee
the safety of the hawks.


156
00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:25.817
Take the boy.

157
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.117
Run, Rudi, run.

158
00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:24.459
Dardo, wait for me.

159
00:12:27.754 --> 00:12:30.465
Dardo. Dardo, wait.

160
00:12:48.275 --> 00:12:49.943
Halt.

161
00:12:51.361 --> 00:12:53.071
- Who are you?
- Apothecary Manzoni...


162
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.616
on an errand of mercy
with the Sister.


163
00:13:14.134 --> 00:13:17.346
- He tried to get it out himself.
- Move him to the table.


164
00:13:17.512 --> 00:13:21.600
Someone keep the coals pumped up.
I need hot iron to cauterize.


165
00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:23.393
Easy.

166
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.023
Rudi.

167
00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:30.025
Boy....

168
00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:33.987
- What happened to the boy?
- Gave himself up to save your life.


169
00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:37.699
Now lie down, Dardo.

170
00:13:40.327 --> 00:13:42.996
Don't let him go.
He doesn't know what he's doing.


171
00:13:43.163 --> 00:13:45.707
Anyone here gonna try and stop me?

172
00:13:55.008 --> 00:13:56.969
Thank you, Sister.

173
00:14:02.724 --> 00:14:05.310
And now, Sister, the soporific,
if you please.


174
00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:08.313
The pain easement.
To be blunt, the jug.


175
00:14:12.359 --> 00:14:14.987
This is purely medicinal.

176
00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:20.158
I think we'll need it.

177
00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:29.543
Bring me the hot iron.

178
00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:47.853
Raise him gently. 
He'll be all right.

179
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.522
- You'll get your boy back.
- Soon as your wound heals.


180
00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:53.108
- You gotta hide.
- We'll get in the mountains.


181
00:14:53.275 --> 00:14:56.236
- We'll make a plan.
- We'll find out who's at the castle.


182
00:14:56.403 --> 00:14:58.530
- We'll get him back, Dardo.
- No.


183
00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.949
No, it's my boy, my problem.

184
00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:03.869
Go home, all of you.
The Hawk will forgive you.


185
00:15:04.077 --> 00:15:05.454
It isn't as easy as that.

186
00:15:05.621 --> 00:15:08.582
- You're an outlaw with a price on you.
- A thousand pieces.


187
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:11.126
- And everyone who helped you.
- A hundred apiece.


188
00:15:11.293 --> 00:15:13.879
We're outlaws together,
whether you like it or not.


189
00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:17.090
Look, Dardo, I can't do anything
about your being outlaws.


190
00:15:17.257 --> 00:15:21.637
You've taken care of that yourselves.
But I can ask you to think now.


191
00:15:21.803 --> 00:15:24.890
Don't cause any more trouble.
Work with us.


192
00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:27.434
Work for the day
when we can right all the wrongs.


193
00:15:27.601 --> 00:15:29.436
When all of Lombardy
will be free again.


194
00:15:29.603 --> 00:15:31.563
Senor Apothecary...

195
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.899
I can't speak for the others...

196
00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.610
but I have no noble purpose.

197
00:15:36.777 --> 00:15:39.780
I'm not out to right anyone's wrongs
but my own.


198
00:15:39.947 --> 00:15:44.034
My boy won't sit waiting at the castle
until all of Lombardy is free.


199
00:15:44.242 --> 00:15:47.788
I'm afraid you'll have to carry that arm
in a sling for a week or so.


200
00:15:47.955 --> 00:15:51.792
If you'd called me sooner, Dardo,
all of this wouldn't have been necessary.


201
00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:55.671
There's some things even a man like you
can't handle alone.


202
00:15:56.463 --> 00:15:58.465
Looks like I'm not alone.

203
00:15:58.632 --> 00:16:00.550
Like it or not.

204
00:16:29.162 --> 00:16:31.665
It wasn't our fault, milady.
We were surrounded.


205
00:16:31.832 --> 00:16:34.293
You mustn't ride into the woods.
Dardo's gang is out.


206
00:16:34.501 --> 00:16:37.879
It's not safe in there.
There must be a score or more.


207
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.798
Dardo?

208
00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:42.009
- Thank you.
- Thank you. If we can...


209
00:16:42.175 --> 00:16:44.511
Oh, thank you, milady.

210
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.995
Well, now,
what have we here, Piccolo?


211
00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:13.332
Is it a lady or a lad?
What do you think?


212
00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:16.251
Either way, it's a puny lad
or a poor lady.


213
00:17:16.418 --> 00:17:18.712
But a handsome horse,
don't you think?


214
00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:22.507
Maybe we should take the horse
and leave the lady-lad to walk home.


215
00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.718
Let go of my bridle, please.

216
00:17:24.885 --> 00:17:27.888
Not so fast. You're in my part
of the forest, milady.


217
00:17:28.555 --> 00:17:30.891
- We warned you.
- Maybe you could explain it to me.


218
00:17:31.058 --> 00:17:33.101
It's a little difficult for a stranger.

219
00:17:33.268 --> 00:17:36.563
Just which part of the forest
does he consider his?


220
00:17:40.067 --> 00:17:43.445
As my good friend Piccolo says,
the sure sign is the birds.


221
00:17:43.654 --> 00:17:46.698
They sing in my part of the forest.
No hawks.


222
00:17:46.907 --> 00:17:49.201
You know,
you remind me a little of my uncle.


223
00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:52.788
Are you the only one allowed to talk
in your part of the forest?


224
00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:01.964
My friend Piccolo's quite a fellow.

225
00:18:02.547 --> 00:18:05.259
He's got ears that can hear
ahead of the rest of us...


226
00:18:05.425 --> 00:18:08.553
like lightning before thunder.
See things you and I can't.


227
00:18:08.762 --> 00:18:12.391
Track a deer by the smell,
pick out a poison mushroom by touch.


228
00:18:12.557 --> 00:18:14.768
And he talks in a way...

229
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.231
But I don't think you'd understand,
milady Anne of Hesse.


230
00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:21.566
You see, he was born without a voice.

231
00:18:24.444 --> 00:18:27.781
If you'll turn around and go home
like a nice boy, I'll forgive you.


232
00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:30.242
But the next time, 
I'll spank you.

233
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.204
And you might give Rudi a message
for me. Tell him I'll be seeing him soon.


234
00:18:51.972 --> 00:18:54.474
I have no particular bond
with my countrymen...


235
00:18:54.641 --> 00:18:56.643
but you make it
so expensive for me.


236
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.604
Anne.

237
00:18:58.979 --> 00:19:01.481
The Marchese di Granezia.

238
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:03.859
Milady.

239
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:07.613
This is indeed an unexpected pleasure.

240
00:19:08.238 --> 00:19:10.157
You give me hope.

241
00:19:10.824 --> 00:19:14.119
I had begun to despair
of our barren valley.


242
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.123
At last, a flower of the court
in our mountains.


243
00:19:18.332 --> 00:19:20.667
A rose among our brambles.

244
00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.962
You're unexpected yourself, marchese.

245
00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:26.798
I had begun to think
there was nothing here but rock...


246
00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:28.508
and arrogant peasants.

247
00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:36.058
These mountains breed arrogance,
even among the nobility.


248
00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:39.186
- And now, if you'll excuse me...
- Don't go, milady.


249
00:19:39.353 --> 00:19:41.355
I need your moral support.

250
00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:43.482
I'm afraid your uncle
is annoyed with me.


251
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.026
I wish you to stay, Anne.

252
00:19:46.193 --> 00:19:49.571
He seems to think I should pay my taxes
like everyone else.


253
00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:53.659
- And why shouldn't you?
- Because I'm not like everyone else.


254
00:19:53.867 --> 00:19:56.870
You're a very important man here,
marchese.


255
00:19:57.037 --> 00:20:01.541
And that is why I can't allow you to set
a bad example for the rest of the valley.


256
00:20:01.708 --> 00:20:04.586
I've been setting a bad example
for years.


257
00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:07.881
And I have come back
to change all that.


258
00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:11.385
That, my dear Ulrich, is your quandary.
This is mine.


259
00:20:11.551 --> 00:20:13.553
If I should pay
your outrageous taxes...


260
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.098
I would be left
without property or position.


261
00:20:16.306 --> 00:20:18.850
Little more than anyone else
in this wretched valley.


262
00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:22.688
I would scarcely be worse off
if you confiscated me entirely.


263
00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:25.440
So at the risk of setting
a bad example...


264
00:20:25.607 --> 00:20:27.693
I am not going to pay you.

265
00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:30.362
You set your example, marchese...

266
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.030
and I'll set mine.

267
00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:35.367
My uncle has already sent
several score to the pillory...


268
00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:37.202
and jailed a hundred more...

269
00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:39.871
for the same attitude
as yours, marchese.


270
00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:41.957
As your uncle
may have heard, milady...


271
00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:45.961
during the Crusade I was imprisoned
briefly in several Saracen jails...


272
00:20:46.128 --> 00:20:48.380
but only briefly.

273
00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:52.092
- And now, if milady will excuse me....
- Until we meet again.


274
00:21:01.602 --> 00:21:03.937
You have just lost a husband.

275
00:21:06.273 --> 00:21:09.901
- Send the march of the guard to me.
- I understand why you brought me here.


276
00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:12.654
We can't afford
a military occupation indefinitely.


277
00:21:12.863 --> 00:21:15.657
The emperor feels a marriage
between Lombardy and Hesse...


278
00:21:15.866 --> 00:21:17.117
would serve the empire.

279
00:21:17.367 --> 00:21:19.953
You can tell the emperor...

280
00:21:20.787 --> 00:21:24.082
I thought the marchese
would be an ideal husband for you.


281
00:21:24.291 --> 00:21:27.294
We probably won't find another
as presentable.


282
00:21:28.295 --> 00:21:31.465
Take a company of men to the castle
of the Marchese di Granezia.


283
00:21:31.632 --> 00:21:32.758
Collect his taxes.

284
00:21:32.966 --> 00:21:36.970
- And if he resists, my lord?
- If he resists, take him.


285
00:21:37.971 --> 00:21:40.807
But I want him taken alive.

286
00:21:45.646 --> 00:21:49.483
One step, two step.
Left foot, right foot.


287
00:21:49.816 --> 00:21:53.987
Lightly, lightly, gay and sprightly.

288
00:21:54.154 --> 00:21:58.116
Arch your back and curtsy slightly.

289
00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:03.455
One, two, three, please.
Flex the knees.


290
00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:07.501
Stop and bow and straight and now...

291
00:22:07.668 --> 00:22:11.713
it's one and two
and follow through.


292
00:22:11.922 --> 00:22:16.510
And three and four
and bow once more and...


293
00:22:16.677 --> 00:22:19.471
No, no, no.

294
00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:21.306
It cannot be done.

295
00:22:21.515 --> 00:22:24.476
Dancing must flow gracefully
and naturally from the spirit...


296
00:22:24.685 --> 00:22:26.520
as milk from a cow.

297
00:22:26.687 --> 00:22:28.480
I cannot draw milk from a bull.

298
00:22:32.192 --> 00:22:35.028
Rudi, really, try to pay attention.

299
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.490
Not many peasant boys
have the chance as you do...


300
00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:41.868
to grow up like a little prince
with servants to train you...


301
00:22:42.035 --> 00:22:45.330
- and take care of your every wish.
- I can take care of myself.


302
00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:47.374
But then what would the servants do?

303
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:50.085
You sound like your father.
Don't you understand?


304
00:22:50.252 --> 00:22:53.672
With Ulrich's influence,
you can be almost anything you want.


305
00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:56.383
Oh, Rudi. I have a message for you.

306
00:22:56.592 --> 00:22:59.761
Your father said to tell you
he'll see you soon.


307
00:24:51.164 --> 00:24:54.209
The Marchese Alessandro of Granezia.
We're honored.


308
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.129
You are the sultan
of these tartar brigands?


309
00:24:57.337 --> 00:24:59.298
Outlaws, marchese, outlaws.

310
00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:01.842
I will take my possessions
and be gone.


311
00:25:02.009 --> 00:25:04.678
Piccolo, untie the marchese
and his friend...


312
00:25:04.845 --> 00:25:06.805
so they can be gone.

313
00:25:08.515 --> 00:25:11.977
I don't think you understand.
I will take my possessions and be gone.


314
00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:15.063
I don't think you understand.
These aren't your possessions.


315
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.316
They were plucked from me
by the Hessians.


316
00:25:17.524 --> 00:25:19.901
And we plucked them
from the Hessians, rudely.


317
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.238
I would like it clearly understood:
Where my possessions go, I go.


318
00:25:23.405 --> 00:25:24.489
If they stay, I stay.

319
00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:28.076
Oh, come now, marchese. You wouldn't
want to live among brigands.


320
00:25:28.243 --> 00:25:30.203
Outlaws, as you say.

321
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.206
Since my castle's been burned
and my land confiscated...


322
00:25:33.373 --> 00:25:37.169
and the law seems powerless
to protect my person or possessions...


323
00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:41.048
then by all the saints, I'm outside
the protection of the law myself.


324
00:25:41.214 --> 00:25:43.675
Outlaw. So you may have me.

325
00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:46.720
You'd undoubtedly be a decorative thing
to have around.


326
00:25:46.887 --> 00:25:48.347
But our number's limited.

327
00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:50.891
We're more in need of men
than amusement.


328
00:25:51.058 --> 00:25:54.269
So I'm afraid we'll just have to forgo
the luxury of your company.


329
00:25:54.436 --> 00:25:58.690
I'm afraid this puts you in the
embarrassing position of keeping me out.


330
00:25:59.149 --> 00:26:01.693
Now, you wouldn't want to spoil
your pretty clothes.


331
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.404
Why don't you go peacefully
like a nice boy?


332
00:26:04.571 --> 00:26:06.365
I could best you at the lance.

333
00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:08.784
You could probably
master me with the bow.


334
00:26:08.951 --> 00:26:12.704
I suggest, therefore,
a man-to-man encounter, barehanded.


335
00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:16.083
Marchese, you're gonna get dirty.

336
00:26:18.919 --> 00:26:20.462
Piccolo.

337
00:27:02.421 --> 00:27:05.132
Very good. Very good. Adroit.

338
00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:07.801
Now having taken
each other's measure, we shall see.


339
00:27:07.968 --> 00:27:11.597
I leave it up to the outlaws.
Is it worth the trouble to keep him out?


340
00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:15.976
And there's just one thing
you should know.


341
00:27:16.143 --> 00:27:18.854
- I have the last word.
- Haven't tried for the third fall.


342
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:22.107
- Until we do.
- Until we do, you have the last word.


343
00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:25.652
Of course, understand one thing:
You take me and you take my minstrel.


344
00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:27.696
I insist on music with my meals.

345
00:27:27.863 --> 00:27:30.657
A couplet to convince your lady
your lies are harmless.


346
00:27:30.824 --> 00:27:32.993
A rhyme to flatter yourself
on your birthday.


347
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.788
A ballad to exaggerate your manhood
for the sake of your friends.


348
00:27:36.997 --> 00:27:40.500
A melancholy song to make yourself
think you're a man of deep thoughts.


349
00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:43.211
I'm a useful fellow to have
when you're moody...


350
00:27:43.378 --> 00:27:46.548
and I don't eat
more than twice my share.


351
00:27:46.757 --> 00:27:49.801
Besides your wish,
since I can't sing to please myself...


352
00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:53.347
but only songs to suit the Hawk,
my music's as good as outlaw...


353
00:27:53.513 --> 00:27:57.059
and wherever my music goes,
I follow.


354
00:27:57.267 --> 00:28:00.187
And now may I ask
when you villains eat?


355
00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:22.334
Your new home, marchese.

356
00:28:31.885 --> 00:28:33.845
A tomb of the ancient gods.

357
00:28:34.012 --> 00:28:35.597
The roof leaks.

358
00:28:35.806 --> 00:28:39.184
The glory of Olympus reduced
to a shelter for outlaws.


359
00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:42.521
I think the ancient gods
lived a little like outlaws themselves.


360
00:28:42.729 --> 00:28:45.065
That's right,
so why shouldn't we live like gods?


361
00:28:45.232 --> 00:28:47.067
Besides,
it's the safest place we know.


362
00:28:47.317 --> 00:28:48.777
Two more mouths to feed, Luigi.

363
00:28:48.944 --> 00:28:51.113
Our good chef, baker
and major-domo, Luigi.


364
00:28:51.321 --> 00:28:53.865
- The Marchese Alessandro of Granezia.
- Call me Lui.


365
00:28:54.074 --> 00:28:55.701
You may just call me marchese.

366
00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:58.245
- And his troubadour.
- I'm delighted to meet you.


367
00:28:58.412 --> 00:29:01.623
- You have a name?
- Just call me Apollo.


368
00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:04.418
Apollo, meet Hercules.

369
00:29:05.335 --> 00:29:08.088
Make yourselves comfortable
and settle down.


370
00:29:14.428 --> 00:29:16.388
Someone's sprung the tinker's trap.

371
00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:18.265
It worked.

372
00:29:24.438 --> 00:29:26.732
Papa Pietro.

373
00:29:38.744 --> 00:29:41.121
Let's try that again.

374
00:29:42.748 --> 00:29:45.792
- What's the news, Papa Pietro?
- That's a tricky trap you rigged.


375
00:29:45.959 --> 00:29:48.921
- What about the boy?
- Oh, is my wife mad.


376
00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:53.091
She's mad at the pigeons, at the boy,
at the duke, at the taxes, mad at me.


377
00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.427
But you?
Oh, she'll never speak to you again.


378
00:29:55.636 --> 00:29:57.262
What's the news about the boy?

379
00:29:57.429 --> 00:29:59.932
I found out
about the people working at the castle.


380
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.976
First, there's Tonio.
You remember, ate the live toad?


381
00:30:03.143 --> 00:30:05.687
- He works in the kitchen.
- Kitchen's no good for us.


382
00:30:05.896 --> 00:30:09.608
Well, then there's Beatrice,
the one with the hairy mole.


383
00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:11.443
Of course, there's Angela.

384
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.986
The redheaded Angela?

385
00:30:13.153 --> 00:30:15.906
She works as maid
to the Hawk's niece.


386
00:30:17.991 --> 00:30:20.619
Angela, the redhead, eh?

387
00:31:10.586 --> 00:31:13.171
- Angela.
- The reason I told Papa I'd do this...


388
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.091
was to have a chance to tell you
what I think of you.


389
00:31:16.258 --> 00:31:18.760
- You get more beautiful.
- You think you're worth it?


390
00:31:18.969 --> 00:31:21.179
- Where's the boy?
- In the great hall.


391
00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:24.433
Weeks on end I don't see you,
but when you need me...


392
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.227
here you are asking me
to risk my neck for you.


393
00:31:27.394 --> 00:31:30.856
- Do you think you're worth it?
- It's a fine neck.


394
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:34.693
Well, maybe you are.

395
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:54.421
Smiling, smiling, always smiling.

396
00:31:54.588 --> 00:31:59.301
Lift your feet, you little monster.

397
00:31:59.551 --> 00:32:02.554
One and two, we're nearly through.

398
00:32:02.763 --> 00:32:06.725
And now you bow, you little beast.

399
00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:17.319
I congratulate you, Francesca.

400
00:32:17.527 --> 00:32:19.404
You've made a fine courtier
out of him.


401
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:21.740
It's hard to believe
he's really Dardo's son.


402
00:32:21.907 --> 00:32:24.993
As to that, you'll have to consult
Francesca, I'm afraid.


403
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.453
Now, Ulrich.

404
00:32:27.287 --> 00:32:30.165
If I had an arrow,
I'd show you whether I was Dardo's son.


405
00:32:30.332 --> 00:32:32.793
- Rudi.
- Dardo.


406
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.172
If anyone moves, I'll put this apple
in your mouth for the fancy pig you are.


407
00:32:37.339 --> 00:32:40.425
This is quite foolish.
None of you will leave the castle alive.


408
00:32:40.592 --> 00:32:42.761
I don't like to interfere
with mother love...


409
00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.013
but I'm taking the boy
where he belongs.


410
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.059
No, Dardo. You mustn't be selfish.
The boy's better off here.


411
00:32:49.268 --> 00:32:50.602
Growing up a Hessian?

412
00:32:51.645 --> 00:32:56.984
Do you want him to grow up like you?
Poor, dirty, a peasant to be spat on?


413
00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.279
What can you give him?
What did you ever give me?


414
00:33:00.487 --> 00:33:02.698
The boy is the only thing
you ever gave me...


415
00:33:02.864 --> 00:33:05.033
and I won't let you take that.

416
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.785
Piccolo.

417
00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:16.128
No. No.

418
00:33:17.379 --> 00:33:19.172
Take the boy.

419
00:33:55.167 --> 00:33:57.669
Piccolo, the chandelier.

420
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:51.890
Meet you at the rope.

421
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.313
We must stay together, milady.
May I offer you my protection?


422
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.315
Allow me to escort you
to your chamber.


423
00:35:00.482 --> 00:35:04.486
These corridors are very dark.
Most terrifying, milady.


424
00:35:04.695 --> 00:35:07.781
I feel as if we were walking
through the heart of a deep forest.


425
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.492
Judging by the boy,
I'm sure no one is safe alone...


426
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:12.911
while that mountain beast
is in the castle.


427
00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:18.417
Who's there?

428
00:35:18.584 --> 00:35:20.586
- What is it?
- Why nothing at all, milady.


429
00:35:20.752 --> 00:35:23.630
The wind caressed the candle
too passionately, I'm afraid.


430
00:35:23.797 --> 00:35:26.842
As I was saying, I hope
the mountain brute didn't frighten you.


431
00:35:27.009 --> 00:35:30.762
- A wild animal is always frightening.
- But fascinating, milady.


432
00:35:30.929 --> 00:35:34.349
- Who are you?
- Only your protector, milady.


433
00:35:35.642 --> 00:35:37.936
- Milady is perfectly safe as long...
- Get out.


434
00:35:38.103 --> 00:35:40.772
But I... I don't quite understand.

435
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:42.316
I said get out.

436
00:35:43.984 --> 00:35:45.819
I know, milady, but I....

437
00:35:45.986 --> 00:35:50.324
I see. Of course, the Hawk's niece,
the Lady Anne of Hesse.


438
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:54.369
- I can understand you coming for your...
- Why didn't I think of this before?


439
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.038
What exactly are you thinking?

440
00:35:56.246 --> 00:35:59.625
- A shame that pleasant conversation end.
- What are you going to do?


441
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:01.835
- I don't like to take a lady by force...
- No!


442
00:36:02.002 --> 00:36:04.838
But I'm afraid we'll take you
as hostage for the boy.


443
00:36:05.005 --> 00:36:06.173
No.

444
00:36:20.854 --> 00:36:22.689
It's a fine boy you've got there.

445
00:36:22.856 --> 00:36:25.484
We missed the boy, but we got this.

446
00:36:29.196 --> 00:36:31.823
Aside from the face,
she looks just like my cousin Rosa.


447
00:36:32.032 --> 00:36:33.075
I guess they're human.

448
00:36:33.283 --> 00:36:36.828
You know, I never saw a real princess
right in the flesh.


449
00:36:36.995 --> 00:36:38.872
Excuse me, princess.

450
00:36:39.081 --> 00:36:41.708
- Duchess, not princess.
- Who can tell the difference?


451
00:36:41.917 --> 00:36:44.878
- Dukes and princes.
- Open your mouth.


452
00:36:45.879 --> 00:36:47.673
It isn't true.

453
00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:50.175
They don't have pearls for teeth
like it says.


454
00:36:50.342 --> 00:36:52.052
Milady.

455
00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:57.516
This is an unexpected pleasure,
marchese.


456
00:36:57.724 --> 00:37:01.603
In spite of certain family differences,
I defend the good name of chivalry...


457
00:37:01.812 --> 00:37:04.856
even here in this heathen temple
among outcasts.


458
00:37:05.065 --> 00:37:08.694
Dardo. I must insist that we accord
our lovely guest...


459
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.946
the respect due her position.

460
00:37:11.113 --> 00:37:13.699
She'll get
what the Hawk's niece deserves.


461
00:37:30.465 --> 00:37:31.758
Go pick her up, marchese.

462
00:37:31.925 --> 00:37:35.429
But, of course, with the respect
due a lady in her position.


463
00:37:42.269 --> 00:37:46.064
Tomorrow, Piccolo will have the honor
of taking our message to the castle.


464
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:49.735
By night, I'll have my boy back
and you'll be sleeping in your own bed.


465
00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:54.573
In the meantime, the marchese trusts
you'll be comfortable with us.


466
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.260
- What are you doing now?
- I'm drying my leg.


467
00:38:15.469 --> 00:38:17.971
And quite a leg it is too.

468
00:38:18.138 --> 00:38:20.974
Just keep the chain tight
so I'll know where you are.


469
00:38:26.146 --> 00:38:29.942
Yes, it's quite a leg for a princess,
countess, or duchess or whatever it is.


470
00:38:30.108 --> 00:38:32.277
Tell me,
where'd you learn to ride like that?


471
00:38:32.486 --> 00:38:35.781
Not at court. You learn to ride like that
in the mountains.


472
00:38:35.948 --> 00:38:38.659
Maybe you're a peasant girl after all,
like Francesca.


473
00:38:40.827 --> 00:38:44.289
I am Anne of Hesse.
My title is marchioness.


474
00:38:44.498 --> 00:38:46.208
My father was Ulrich's brother.

475
00:38:46.416 --> 00:38:49.503
But I was raised and learned to ride
in the South with my mother.


476
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.005
The country is very much like this.

477
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:05.227
You'll have to let the chain out a little.
I left my sandal down by the water.


478
00:39:14.736 --> 00:39:16.989
Isn't it a little dull for you
after the court?


479
00:39:17.197 --> 00:39:20.033
It must be lonely without the dukes
and counts and princes.


480
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.410
Tell me about them.

481
00:39:21.577 --> 00:39:24.454
What are they like
when they take their armor off?


482
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.841
I learned a long time ago, milady...

483
00:39:36.049 --> 00:39:39.052
never trust a mountain cat
when she stops snarling...


484
00:39:39.219 --> 00:39:42.556
and never trust a woman
when your back is turned.


485
00:39:53.275 --> 00:39:56.862
Why didn't we ever think of this before?
This is the life.


486
00:39:57.029 --> 00:39:59.698
All those years I spent
sweeping other people's smoke...


487
00:39:59.865 --> 00:40:03.994
cooped up in chimneys,
looking at the sky through a square hole.


488
00:40:04.411 --> 00:40:07.873
- Fresh air, I'm not quite used to it.
- Scarpa, my nimble-toed friend...


489
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:11.376
tell me,
wouldn't it be easier to use your hand?


490
00:40:11.543 --> 00:40:14.588
Yes, it'd be easier to live like animals
and eat with our teeth.


491
00:40:14.755 --> 00:40:18.467
Be easier to walk around
in our bare skins, let our hair grow.


492
00:40:18.634 --> 00:40:21.136
It'd be easier for you
to talk like other people...


493
00:40:21.303 --> 00:40:22.930
without rhymes and rhythms.

494
00:40:23.096 --> 00:40:25.766
But we're civilized
and the art of civilization...


495
00:40:25.933 --> 00:40:29.728
is doing natural things
in an unnatural way.


496
00:40:29.895 --> 00:40:32.064
I'm just more civilized
than the rest of you.


497
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.607
I salute a fellow artist.

498
00:40:33.774 --> 00:40:36.902
Skinner, we have a love letter to write
to the Hawk.


499
00:40:44.076 --> 00:40:47.454
Piccolo, don't go away.

500
00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:48.830
Sit down and talk to me.

501
00:40:52.626 --> 00:40:56.672
No, really. I can understand you.

502
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.470
You and Dardo have known each other
a long time, haven't you?


503
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:16.650
You like him, don't you?

504
00:41:19.611 --> 00:41:21.488
Why do you like him?

505
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.996
He's a bird?

506
00:41:46.888 --> 00:41:48.849
He's free as a bird?

507
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.103
Oh, he's a free spirit.
That's what you mean.


508
00:41:55.522 --> 00:41:58.525
The birds do sing
in his part of the forest.


509
00:42:00.694 --> 00:42:02.529
What about women?

510
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.991
He treats them badly, doesn't he?

511
00:42:06.199 --> 00:42:09.244
Puts chains around their necks.

512
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:11.663
Do you think that's right?

513
00:42:12.372 --> 00:42:15.500
Do you see any reason
why I should be chained?


514
00:42:15.709 --> 00:42:19.922
After all, I couldn't go anyplace, could I?
The guards wouldn't let me.


515
00:42:22.507 --> 00:42:25.385
Then if it's just a cruel whim
of Dardo's...


516
00:42:25.552 --> 00:42:27.846
couldn't you undo the chain?

517
00:42:39.399 --> 00:42:41.401
Oh, marchese.

518
00:42:45.447 --> 00:42:48.408
- Milady.
- When we said, "Till we meet again"...


519
00:42:48.575 --> 00:42:51.078
I'd hoped it would be
different circumstances.


520
00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:54.456
So had I, but your uncle intervened.

521
00:42:54.665 --> 00:42:57.709
And now to find myself
your prisoner....


522
00:42:57.918 --> 00:43:00.754
- You'd have preferred me to be yours?
- No.


523
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:03.632
But I hardly expected to find
the Marchese di Granezia...


524
00:43:03.799 --> 00:43:05.425
as a stableboy.

525
00:43:05.592 --> 00:43:08.595
It has certain advantages
over the dungeons of the castle.


526
00:43:08.762 --> 00:43:12.224
But it's all
so unnecessary, Alessandro.


527
00:43:12.391 --> 00:43:13.976
How's that, milady?

528
00:43:14.184 --> 00:43:16.937
- If you'd been more reasonable...
- Paid my taxes?


529
00:43:17.104 --> 00:43:21.233
You'd have had more than your taxes
back with my marriage settlement.


530
00:43:21.441 --> 00:43:24.820
You'll forgive me, milady,
if I find your proposal somewhat sudden.


531
00:43:24.987 --> 00:43:26.905
But it's not, really.

532
00:43:27.072 --> 00:43:30.492
I'm quite sure such a pleasant idea
would never have slipped my mind.


533
00:43:30.701 --> 00:43:33.245
My uncle had suggested it.

534
00:43:33.787 --> 00:43:36.123
I can only say your uncle
has an alarming way...


535
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.125
of welcoming me to the family.

536
00:43:38.792 --> 00:43:43.255
The Emperor Barbarossa knows we can't
afford a military occupation indefinitely.


537
00:43:43.463 --> 00:43:47.092
Therefore, a marriage between
Hesse and Lombardy seems....


538
00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:50.679
But I can't help being a woman.

539
00:43:50.846 --> 00:43:53.265
If I must be married
for reasons of empire...


540
00:43:53.432 --> 00:43:56.518
I wish it could be someone
I find attractive.


541
00:43:57.019 --> 00:43:59.021
You overwhelm me, milady.

542
00:43:59.229 --> 00:44:02.816
- Are you surprised I find you attractive?
- Not at all.


543
00:44:02.983 --> 00:44:06.361
I'm surprised that I find myself
wanting to believe you.


544
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.655
It's a pity it's too late.

545
00:44:08.822 --> 00:44:11.533
But it's not too late.
If I could tell my uncle that...


546
00:44:11.742 --> 00:44:14.786
My dear Anne, if
I may be so bold...

547
00:44:14.953 --> 00:44:18.123
you may tell your uncle
that I find you fascinating.


548
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:21.293
If only I could be sure you're as honest
as you are pretty.


549
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:24.004
But then, with a collar around
your lovely neck...


550
00:44:24.171 --> 00:44:25.797
it's hard to tell...

551
00:44:26.006 --> 00:44:29.551
whether your throat's blushing
from passion or deceit.


552
00:44:31.845 --> 00:44:33.889
And now if milady will forgive me...

553
00:44:34.056 --> 00:44:36.516
I must get back to the stables.

554
00:44:59.915 --> 00:45:01.541
"By sundown tonight."

555
00:45:01.708 --> 00:45:03.001
- That all?
- That's enough.


556
00:45:03.168 --> 00:45:05.712
I don't understand that.
I can't write a word.


557
00:45:05.879 --> 00:45:08.548
Now that the ransom note's written,
I suggest I take it.


558
00:45:08.715 --> 00:45:10.175
Piccolo's taking the note.

559
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:13.845
That's manifestly absurd.
He can't speak.


560
00:45:14.054 --> 00:45:15.264
He doesn't have to.

561
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:17.391
He wouldn't know
what to say to Ulrich.


562
00:45:17.557 --> 00:45:19.017
Everything's in the note.

563
00:45:19.184 --> 00:45:21.853
I'm prepared to answer the count
in his own language...


564
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.273
- He'll understand.
- And fight on his own terms.


565
00:45:24.439 --> 00:45:27.901
Well, then, now the Hawk's
going to fight on our terms, marchese.


566
00:45:28.068 --> 00:45:32.281
Dardo, we still have a third fall
to be settled.


567
00:45:32.447 --> 00:45:34.741
There are more important things
to settle now.


568
00:45:35.367 --> 00:45:37.536
No short stops at the tavern.

569
00:45:38.745 --> 00:45:41.081
If you're not back by sundown, I'll...

570
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.888
I can't understand it, sire.
It's not like milady Anne.


571
00:45:57.055 --> 00:46:00.559
Her bed's not been slept in
and her nightdress is just as I left it.


572
00:46:00.726 --> 00:46:05.063
Every gown's in place.
I can't imagine what she had in mind.


573
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.941
The only thing she took
was a pillowcase and an apple.


574
00:46:08.108 --> 00:46:10.152
- Impertinent youth.
- Your Grace.


575
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.862
It appears he has a message.

576
00:46:15.616 --> 00:46:18.243
Release him
and bring me the message.


577
00:46:21.747 --> 00:46:24.249
Sit down and take some wine.

578
00:47:20.973 --> 00:47:22.516
You may go.

579
00:47:23.684 --> 00:47:26.687
- Who is the hunter's nearest relative?
- His uncle.


580
00:47:26.853 --> 00:47:30.565
An old man, a retired cobbler
known in the village as Papa Pietro.


581
00:47:30.732 --> 00:47:32.985
I want you to build a gallows
in the piazza...


582
00:47:33.151 --> 00:47:36.154
and tie Papa Pietro under it
for all to see.


583
00:47:36.697 --> 00:47:40.033
We'll hang him at dawn
for the outlaw.


584
00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:46.498
So you're the dummy. 
Dardo's friend.

585
00:47:46.665 --> 00:47:48.667
You can't speak.

586
00:47:48.834 --> 00:47:51.336
An admirable quality
in one of your kind.


587
00:47:52.337 --> 00:47:56.174
I assume that Dardo
intended to insult me by sending you...


588
00:47:56.341 --> 00:47:58.885
or perhaps he thought
there could be no argument.


589
00:47:59.219 --> 00:48:01.888
If so, he's as defective as you.

590
00:48:02.055 --> 00:48:05.601
He's blind. Or worse, he's witless.

591
00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:08.562
His mind is confused
by his sentimentality.


592
00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:12.566
A common disease
among a conquered people.


593
00:48:12.733 --> 00:48:16.528
Does he seriously suppose that I would
sacrifice the interests of an empire...


594
00:48:16.695 --> 00:48:19.698
for the comfort or even the life
of a woman?


595
00:48:20.407 --> 00:48:23.994
I assure you,
I have no such compunction.


596
00:48:26.496 --> 00:48:28.373
You may tell your friend....

597
00:48:28.624 --> 00:48:31.376
Oh, you can't tell him, can you?

598
00:48:31.543 --> 00:48:35.213
Well, then,
since you haven't a tongue to talk...


599
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.884
you'll have to deliver my message
in another way.


600
00:48:39.092 --> 00:48:42.554
Take him below.
I'll join you immediately.


601
00:49:31.561 --> 00:49:33.146
Troubadour.

602
00:49:34.106 --> 00:49:36.191
What will happen if...?

603
00:49:36.566 --> 00:49:38.110
If Piccolo doesn't come back?

604
00:49:38.318 --> 00:49:40.946
Why would you
want to discuss it, milady?


605
00:49:41.321 --> 00:49:43.865
- I'm the hostage.
- Exactly.


606
00:49:45.075 --> 00:49:48.495
I used to sing a ballad concerning
the fate of the fair Zuleika...


607
00:49:49.329 --> 00:49:50.998
daughter of the sultan...

608
00:49:51.164 --> 00:49:53.500
who was taken hostage
on the Crusades.


609
00:49:54.001 --> 00:49:57.629
But I don't think it would be
of much comfort to milady...


610
00:49:57.796 --> 00:50:00.340
under the circumstances.

611
00:50:38.211 --> 00:50:40.380
Why did you do that?

612
00:50:42.257 --> 00:50:44.134
You'll be going home soon.

613
00:50:45.886 --> 00:50:48.430
Shouldn't Piccolo be back?

614
00:50:49.222 --> 00:50:51.725
- He'll be back.
- I hope you're right.


615
00:50:51.892 --> 00:50:54.102
I hope I'll be going home soon...

616
00:50:54.269 --> 00:50:56.855
that it works out as you planned.

617
00:50:57.564 --> 00:50:59.066
I hope you get your boy back.

618
00:51:01.443 --> 00:51:02.945
You miss your feather bed.

619
00:51:03.153 --> 00:51:05.572
You've never slept
on the ground before...


620
00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:09.201
or ate out of a wooden bowl
or bathed in a mountain spring.


621
00:51:09.701 --> 00:51:13.914
It's just I wanted you to know that
I respect you for wanting your boy back.


622
00:51:14.081 --> 00:51:15.540
It's right that you should.

623
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.877
- Thank you.
- I mean...


624
00:51:19.586 --> 00:51:21.922
maybe I do belong at the castle.

625
00:51:22.089 --> 00:51:24.424
It's my life, I suppose.

626
00:51:24.591 --> 00:51:26.927
But it's not for Rudi.

627
00:51:27.803 --> 00:51:30.305
You can't make a prince
out of a peasant.


628
00:51:30.472 --> 00:51:32.599
He's like you.

629
00:51:34.268 --> 00:51:37.145
My uncle says
your mountains breed arrogance.


630
00:51:37.312 --> 00:51:39.648
Piccolo says it's free spirit.

631
00:51:39.815 --> 00:51:41.566
I don't know.

632
00:51:41.733 --> 00:51:44.069
But the boy
belongs in the mountains...


633
00:51:44.236 --> 00:51:45.654
in the forest.

634
00:51:45.821 --> 00:51:48.282
Your part of the forest.

635
00:51:48.824 --> 00:51:50.492
What do you want?

636
00:51:51.743 --> 00:51:56.582
It's just that I wanted you to know
that no matter what happens, I...


637
00:52:00.919 --> 00:52:04.423
Where's Piccolo?
Why doesn't he come?


638
00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.300
It's so long after dark.

639
00:52:07.968 --> 00:52:09.928
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened for you.


640
00:52:10.137 --> 00:52:12.306
You're frightened for yourself...

641
00:52:12.472 --> 00:52:14.308
- but you're wasting your time.
- No.


642
00:52:14.474 --> 00:52:16.852
You want to make love,
afraid he won't come back.


643
00:52:17.102 --> 00:52:20.147
- Dardo.
- You're beautiful.


644
00:52:32.534 --> 00:52:34.119
It's a lie.

645
00:52:35.245 --> 00:52:36.997
- Your mouth is lying.
- I don't know.


646
00:52:37.164 --> 00:52:38.248
What could you feel?

647
00:52:38.457 --> 00:52:40.334
Feeling had to be burned out of you...

648
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.211
with the first peasant's cottage
your uncle burned.


649
00:52:43.378 --> 00:52:45.464
Buy a husband
with a marriage settlement...


650
00:52:45.672 --> 00:52:48.550
look for a stableboy
like your uncle found Francesca...


651
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.470
because your own men
are as empty as you are.


652
00:52:51.637 --> 00:52:53.055
- Yes, I lied.
- Get away.


653
00:52:53.305 --> 00:52:55.682
- I'm glad.
- Get back until I decide what to do.


654
00:52:55.849 --> 00:52:58.352
I'm glad it's a lie.
I'd hate for it to be the truth.


655
00:52:58.518 --> 00:53:00.312
- Dardo.
- Dardo.


656
00:53:00.479 --> 00:53:02.397
- Dardo.
- Dardo.


657
00:53:07.694 --> 00:53:09.571
Piccolo.

658
00:53:19.373 --> 00:53:21.583
Biggie, get some warm olive oil.

659
00:53:24.586 --> 00:53:26.546
Go to the castle?

660
00:53:29.424 --> 00:53:32.844
Square. Go to the city square.

661
00:53:33.387 --> 00:53:36.014
- Look after him.
- Dardo.


662
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:37.683
Tie her up.

663
00:54:21.476 --> 00:54:23.645
What does it mean? The gallows.

664
00:54:23.854 --> 00:54:27.983
He hangs at dawn. 
For the outlaw.

665
00:54:41.788 --> 00:54:44.499
Get your horses.
We're riding into the city.


666
00:55:33.006 --> 00:55:35.050
Company alert. Stand guard.

667
00:55:35.217 --> 00:55:38.053
Incoming from the west gate.

668
00:55:39.721 --> 00:55:43.350
- Form your ranks.
- Company, on guard.


669
00:56:46.705 --> 00:56:50.208
You rest here, Papa Pietro.
The apothecary will be here soon.


670
00:57:06.767 --> 00:57:09.937
What is this? What is this about?

671
00:57:11.313 --> 00:57:13.273
Are you afraid of me?

672
00:57:13.774 --> 00:57:18.070
No. There's no longer any fear of you.
You can do us no more harm now.


673
00:57:19.071 --> 00:57:22.658
I remember, Dardo. I remember when
you were born in these mountains...


674
00:57:22.824 --> 00:57:26.119
and your father ran away
to fight in foreign places.


675
00:57:26.286 --> 00:57:27.412
We pitied the child.

676
00:57:27.621 --> 00:57:30.123
We said he could never be blamed,
however he grew.


677
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:33.293
I remember when you came into town
as a boy.


678
00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.129
We laughed at your matted hair
and your wild manners.


679
00:57:36.296 --> 00:57:38.173
We made excuses for your mischief...

680
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:40.467
because you harmed
nobody but yourself.


681
00:57:40.634 --> 00:57:43.595
We excused you, 
I suppose, because...

682
00:57:43.762 --> 00:57:47.766
Well, there's a little of you in each of us
that none of us dared show.


683
00:57:48.183 --> 00:57:52.646
But now I know it's the devil in all of us
that we saw in you.


684
00:57:52.813 --> 00:57:54.982
You're one of us,
you're of my own family...


685
00:57:55.148 --> 00:57:58.986
and I did what I could to raise you,
but we've come to take you back.


686
00:57:59.152 --> 00:58:01.780
- We saved the old man.
- You saved Pietro.


687
00:58:01.989 --> 00:58:05.284
Now there are five hanging in his place.
Tomorrow, there'll be ten.


688
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:07.786
It won't end till the Hawk
gets what he wants:


689
00:58:07.953 --> 00:58:09.997
The outlaws in prison
and Dardo hanged.


690
00:58:10.163 --> 00:58:13.333
Tell them to come quietly,
but if they don't...


691
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.335
we're prepared to fight.

692
00:58:15.502 --> 00:58:16.962
No.

693
00:58:17.838 --> 00:58:19.965
No, there'll be no fighting between us.

694
00:58:20.173 --> 00:58:22.301
- No one will hang for me.
- Nonna Bartoli.


695
00:58:22.467 --> 00:58:25.637
Nonna Bartoli, 
I want to talk to you.

696
00:58:25.804 --> 00:58:29.182
It so happens I was the one
faced death tonight and not you.


697
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:31.977
You weren't gonna be hanged
in the morning, but I was.


698
00:58:32.185 --> 00:58:33.979
And with that rope around my neck...

699
00:58:34.146 --> 00:58:37.024
it would've been hard to convince me
Dardo put it there.


700
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.526
It was the Hawk, that's who did it.

701
00:58:39.693 --> 00:58:42.696
Was it Dardo made skulking cowards
out of you all?


702
00:58:43.405 --> 00:58:45.032
You wanted something to happen?

703
00:58:45.198 --> 00:58:47.242
Dardo made things happen.

704
00:58:47.409 --> 00:58:49.912
All right, he made trouble for us.

705
00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:53.540
I'll be lucky if I come out of this
without rheumatism.


706
00:58:54.166 --> 00:58:56.543
I had myself convinced
up there in the gallows...


707
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:58.587
that I was willing to die.

708
00:58:58.754 --> 00:59:01.924
For the first time in my life,
I felt like a hero.


709
00:59:02.132 --> 00:59:04.885
And you're not gonna
take that away from me.


710
00:59:05.052 --> 00:59:07.095
If you're all so willing to fight...

711
00:59:07.262 --> 00:59:10.557
then fight the Hawk and his Hessians,
not Dardo.


712
00:59:10.724 --> 00:59:12.851
Let's fight them and be rid of them...

713
00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.895
or die fighting, at least.

714
00:59:15.062 --> 00:59:18.398
Papa Pietro,
you make me proud and ashamed.


715
00:59:19.399 --> 00:59:20.442
- We'll fight.
- Easy.


716
00:59:20.651 --> 00:59:22.527
We'll fight together now.

717
00:59:22.694 --> 00:59:25.697
And we'll live together
to see Lombardy free.


718
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.617
Wait. Nonna Bartoli's right.

719
00:59:28.784 --> 00:59:31.245
- First of all, I must go back.
- They'll hang you.


720
00:59:31.411 --> 00:59:33.538
We can't let them hang
the five old men.


721
00:59:33.705 --> 00:59:36.917
- So let them hang me.
- No.


722
00:59:37.668 --> 00:59:40.087
Besides, it'll give us time to prepare.

723
01:00:10.784 --> 01:00:13.662
- Your father disappoints me.
- He'll never surrender.


724
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:15.747
I should have thought his arrogance...

725
01:00:15.914 --> 01:00:18.000
would never allow others
to hang for him.


726
01:00:21.295 --> 01:00:23.839
Let the execution proceed.

727
01:00:27.259 --> 01:00:29.511
Stop. Wait.

728
01:00:32.806 --> 01:00:36.143
- Let him pass.
- Let him pass.


729
01:00:37.311 --> 01:00:39.229
Hold the rest.

730
01:00:47.738 --> 01:00:49.156
- Send the boy away.
- No.


731
01:00:49.323 --> 01:00:51.290
There's no reason
for him to see this.


732
01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:53.684
I think it will be a
good lesson to watch.


733
01:00:53.827 --> 01:00:55.746
That's why you're here, isn't it?

734
01:00:56.246 --> 01:01:00.000
I've given up trying to fight you,
Ulrich, as a man.


735
01:01:00.167 --> 01:01:04.296
Last night, my best friend was killed
along with the troubadour and skinner...


736
01:01:04.504 --> 01:01:08.467
to save one man from hanging.
Now there's five.


737
01:01:08.675 --> 01:01:10.552
Release the five men.

738
01:01:10.761 --> 01:01:12.846
Have you anything to say
before I hang you?


739
01:01:13.055 --> 01:01:14.640
No.

740
01:01:15.682 --> 01:01:17.643
Yes, wait.

741
01:01:19.269 --> 01:01:23.315
Since you're here, Rudi, I want you
to learn the right lesson from this.


742
01:01:23.482 --> 01:01:26.652
A man can't live by himself alone.
I was wrong.


743
01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.322
But a man who has friends...

744
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:32.824
like the three
who aren't here today...


745
01:01:33.033 --> 01:01:36.370
who are willing to risk their own lives
for someone else....


746
01:01:36.536 --> 01:01:41.375
A man who has friends like that
will never really die.


747
01:01:43.669 --> 01:01:46.338
You're going to learn
a lesson too, Ulrich.


748
01:01:46.546 --> 01:01:49.216
When you kill a man,
you've done the most anyone can do.


749
01:01:49.383 --> 01:01:50.884
And it's not enough.

750
01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:53.887
Because a man
who knows what he's dying for...


751
01:01:54.054 --> 01:01:55.347
only seems to die.

752
01:01:55.555 --> 01:01:57.391
Hang him.

753
01:02:01.353 --> 01:02:04.439
No. No, Ulrich, not because of me.

754
01:02:04.606 --> 01:02:06.608
Do you have to hang him?

755
01:02:06.817 --> 01:02:09.736
Please, Ulrich, isn't it enough
for your pride of empire?


756
01:02:11.071 --> 01:02:12.614
Proceed with the execution.

757
01:02:12.823 --> 01:02:14.908
No, you can't do it!

758
01:02:21.748 --> 01:02:23.584
Hang him.

759
01:02:41.602 --> 01:02:43.353
The body may be claimed at dusk.

760
01:02:43.562 --> 01:02:45.939
Take the outlaws to the dungeon.

761
01:02:47.774 --> 01:02:49.610
Believe me,
I can quite understand...


762
01:02:49.776 --> 01:02:52.613
your attraction to a lusty animal.

763
01:02:53.071 --> 01:02:54.907
I'm afraid it's a family trait.

764
01:02:55.449 --> 01:02:57.743
You will forget him,
find yourself another.


765
01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:01.413
- I'm going back to Germany, Ulrich.
- I don't think so. Not yet.


766
01:03:01.622 --> 01:03:04.166
You haven't served your purpose here.

767
01:03:04.374 --> 01:03:06.293
Or had you forgotten why you came?

768
01:03:08.295 --> 01:03:11.423
- The buzzards are out already.
- Trust the Hawk to find death.


769
01:03:15.302 --> 01:03:18.138
Now, pretty birdies,
don't be unreasonable.


770
01:03:18.305 --> 01:03:19.973
Fly back over the body once more.

771
01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.478
Just once more.
Just till Ulrich leaves the square.


772
01:03:24.895 --> 01:03:30.275
Fly you mangy,
ugly-faced monstrosity. Fly.


773
01:03:44.998 --> 01:03:47.626
Keep your grimy hands off me.

774
01:03:49.711 --> 01:03:52.297
Before you make trouble for yourself,
let me warn you:


775
01:03:52.506 --> 01:03:55.175
It might be worth your while
to inform your master...


776
01:03:55.342 --> 01:03:57.511
the Marchese
Alessandro di Granezia...


777
01:03:57.678 --> 01:04:00.806
would like to discuss a wedding.

778
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.706
Good mother,
could you direct the poor players...


779
01:04:25.872 --> 01:04:27.874
to the castle
of Count Ulrich of Hesse?


780
01:04:28.041 --> 01:04:29.835
I can direct you to the devil.

781
01:04:30.002 --> 01:04:33.714
Follow the marsh road
and the smell of death will lead you.


782
01:05:04.578 --> 01:05:06.413
You know, I'm hungry.

783
01:05:09.249 --> 01:05:10.250
You're all right.

784
01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:13.253
Get me out of this contraption.

785
01:05:14.046 --> 01:05:17.090
- There we are. Easy.
- Get the noose.


786
01:05:18.926 --> 01:05:20.469
Must be an easier way of dying.

787
01:05:20.636 --> 01:05:23.430
Plans are made for tomorrow morning.
The city's ready.


788
01:05:23.597 --> 01:05:24.640
Shall we go?

789
01:05:24.806 --> 01:05:27.267
Dardo can eat while we bury him.

790
01:05:34.608 --> 01:05:37.236
Send the lady Anne to us immediately.

791
01:05:38.028 --> 01:05:39.780
You may go.

792
01:05:41.114 --> 01:05:45.619
Now, what are the details
of this uprising, Alessandro?


793
01:05:45.786 --> 01:05:49.289
Tomorrow morning while you
are attending Allhallows services...


794
01:05:49.456 --> 01:05:53.252
a group of peasants will present
themselves at the castle bearing gifts.


795
01:05:53.418 --> 01:05:55.837
A gesture of humility and defeat.

796
01:05:56.046 --> 01:05:59.091
Once inside the castle,
they plan to overcome the guard...


797
01:05:59.299 --> 01:06:01.760
raise the portcullis,
lay siege to the castle...


798
01:06:01.969 --> 01:06:04.179
and be ready to meet you
on your return.


799
01:06:04.429 --> 01:06:07.641
And who is to lead
this gallant little band?


800
01:06:07.808 --> 01:06:11.270
The old man? The apothecary?
The philosopher?


801
01:06:11.436 --> 01:06:14.481
Little Papa Pietro or his nagging wife?

802
01:06:14.648 --> 01:06:17.985
You see, I know them all.
They needed Dardo.


803
01:06:18.151 --> 01:06:21.280
Who else do they have?
His friend the dummy is dead.


804
01:06:21.446 --> 01:06:23.949
Who is supposed to lead them?

805
01:06:24.283 --> 01:06:26.326
You, marchese?

806
01:06:26.827 --> 01:06:28.328
Dardo.

807
01:06:28.704 --> 01:06:31.707
I'm afraid the outlaws have bewitched
and beguiled you, Ulrich.


808
01:06:31.957 --> 01:06:35.335
Neatly and with some imagination,
you must admit.


809
01:06:37.796 --> 01:06:42.509
At this moment, the town
is burying a coffin full of stones...


810
01:06:42.676 --> 01:06:47.014
while Dardo's corpse meets with
the ghosts of his three dead friends...


811
01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.683
to plan the assault on the castle.

812
01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:53.395
Let them come. Let them attack.
We'll be ready.


813
01:06:53.604 --> 01:06:57.691
It seems your countrymen must
learn their lesson in blood, marchese.


814
01:06:59.318 --> 01:07:01.194
You sent for me, Ulrich.

815
01:07:01.403 --> 01:07:03.488
I think you know
your husband-to-be.


816
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:05.490
- No.
- My dear Anne.


817
01:07:05.699 --> 01:07:07.034
Ulrich, I meant what I said.

818
01:07:07.534 --> 01:07:10.495
We are deeply indebted
to the marchese, Anne.


819
01:07:10.704 --> 01:07:15.667
He has just told me
that hanging Dardo was not enough.


820
01:07:15.876 --> 01:07:19.212
His foolish friends
intend to attack us in the morning.


821
01:07:20.255 --> 01:07:22.507
Circumstances
and your most lovely self...


822
01:07:22.674 --> 01:07:25.761
persuaded me that my heart
and sympathetic self-interest...


823
01:07:25.928 --> 01:07:27.638
lie with you and your uncle.

824
01:07:29.222 --> 01:07:31.892
You've betrayed them because of me?

825
01:07:32.392 --> 01:07:34.227
Because of what I said?

826
01:07:34.394 --> 01:07:35.562
Your Grace.

827
01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:37.606
The impresario
of a players company...


828
01:07:37.773 --> 01:07:41.193
request your permission
to entertain in the great hall tonight.


829
01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.195
Send him in.

830
01:07:43.403 --> 01:07:46.240
We are celebrating tonight,
aren't we, Anne?


831
01:07:47.574 --> 01:07:51.036
Yes. If you say so.

832
01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:54.414
We are celebrating tonight.

833
01:07:59.586 --> 01:08:02.047
The impresario Arturo of Milan,
Your Grace.


834
01:08:02.256 --> 01:08:04.716
Bringing with him
from the far ends of the Earth...


835
01:08:04.925 --> 01:08:08.220
the Brothers Bulanos,
the bouncing Bavarians...


836
01:08:08.428 --> 01:08:11.265
Petrolini and his lndian bear,
almost human.


837
01:08:11.431 --> 01:08:14.768
The greatest assortment of players,
acrobats, jugglers and clowns...


838
01:08:14.935 --> 01:08:18.063
ever assembled
for the pleasure of the court.


839
01:09:22.502 --> 01:09:24.212
You're Nonna Bartoli?

840
01:09:24.379 --> 01:09:25.672
I'm Anne.

841
01:09:25.839 --> 01:09:28.342
- Anne of...
- I know you.


842
01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:32.137
I had to come to tell you
Ulrich knows about the uprising.


843
01:09:32.304 --> 01:09:33.805
Alessandro's betrayed you.

844
01:09:35.015 --> 01:09:36.642
Why do you come to me?

845
01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:38.977
- Last night it was your husband...
- Yes.


846
01:09:39.186 --> 01:09:41.313
It was my husband
you were going to hang.


847
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.482
Let me talk to him.

848
01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:44.816
He's gone.

849
01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:47.194
To bury Dardo.

850
01:09:47.361 --> 01:09:49.738
Then, Nonna Bartoli,
you have to listen to me.


851
01:09:49.905 --> 01:09:52.491
You have no business here.
We know of no uprising.


852
01:09:52.658 --> 01:09:55.494
Then send me to someone who does.
Or go yourself.


853
01:09:55.661 --> 01:09:59.373
Find them and tell them Ulrich is waiting
to slaughter them when they come.


854
01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.541
Tell them to give it up.

855
01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:03.585
The Hawk's niece said to give it up?

856
01:10:03.794 --> 01:10:07.839
Believe me, the two of them are sitting
up at the carnival right now, celebrating.


857
01:10:08.048 --> 01:10:10.759
Why should I lie?
Why should I come here?


858
01:10:10.926 --> 01:10:12.886
Why did you come?

859
01:10:13.553 --> 01:10:17.224
Because I'm ashamed of what I am.

860
01:10:17.391 --> 01:10:19.226
And what I've done.

861
01:10:19.685 --> 01:10:23.230
I can say it now
because my pride was hanged with him.


862
01:10:24.064 --> 01:10:27.693
I came because I love Dardo.

863
01:10:31.321 --> 01:10:33.574
- Go home, Anne.
- You must believe me.


864
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.618
There's nothing for you here.
Go home.


865
01:10:39.746 --> 01:10:41.373
Please.

866
01:10:49.548 --> 01:10:50.966
I believe her, Dardo.

867
01:10:52.426 --> 01:10:54.052
Why should we believe her?

868
01:10:54.219 --> 01:10:56.471
Maybe the Hawk sent her.
How do we know?


869
01:10:56.638 --> 01:10:59.558
Give it up, she says.
Isn't that what he'd want us to do?


870
01:10:59.725 --> 01:11:01.643
She loves you, Dardo.

871
01:11:01.852 --> 01:11:05.564
I know you don't want to believe that.
You don't want to trust yourself...


872
01:11:05.731 --> 01:11:08.233
because you're afraid
you love her too.


873
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.069
That's a hard thing
for Dardo to admit.


874
01:11:11.236 --> 01:11:16.116
Now, why are you so ready to believe
every woman loves you except this one?


875
01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:26.084
You know what this means.

876
01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:28.128
We attack tonight.

877
01:11:28.462 --> 01:11:30.172
But how?

878
01:11:39.306 --> 01:11:42.392
The carnival. That's right,
she said there's a carnival.


879
01:11:43.393 --> 01:11:46.396
Can you do it? You're sure?

880
01:11:47.147 --> 01:11:50.108
All right, we'll do it. Tonight.

881
01:11:53.654 --> 01:11:55.948
A little more chameleon,
I believe, apothecary.


882
01:11:56.114 --> 01:11:58.825
You'll find your head in my trunk
under the lion skin.


883
01:12:00.535 --> 01:12:02.329
Do you have to keep grinning at me?

884
01:12:02.496 --> 01:12:05.457
The very essence of the quintessence
of the clown's art.


885
01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:09.419
Piccolo, look sad. Mad. Glad.

886
01:12:09.628 --> 01:12:12.965
You, Dardo, on the other hand,
must have a touch of whimsical sadness.


887
01:12:13.131 --> 01:12:14.216
And a bulbous nose.

888
01:12:14.424 --> 01:12:15.676
Just so you hide my face.

889
01:12:15.842 --> 01:12:18.679
A few drops of fish oil
on the nose wax now, apothecary.


890
01:12:18.845 --> 01:12:20.722
Sprinkle of ground goat's foot.

891
01:12:20.931 --> 01:12:23.976
Need a suspicion of powdered
whalebone for whiteness, and done.


892
01:12:24.142 --> 01:12:27.187
Do you have to keep talking?
We have a war in 10 minutes.


893
01:12:27.354 --> 01:12:29.481
Do you have to throw a knife
with your toes?


894
01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:31.984
Respect the technique
of a fellow artist, then.


895
01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:35.696
This takes me back to my youth when
I dreamed of leading my own troupe...


896
01:12:35.862 --> 01:12:37.823
before I worked
with the marchese...


897
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:41.702
that double-dyed third cousin
to a spawn of pig's bile.


898
01:12:41.868 --> 01:12:47.749
That jaundiced excretion
of a bilious toad's eye.


899
01:12:54.881 --> 01:12:57.342
The city's ready when you are.

900
01:12:57.593 --> 01:13:01.388
- Let's be on our way.
- Piccolo, your beard. My symbolorium.


901
01:13:03.849 --> 01:13:05.475
We're ready.

902
01:13:13.191 --> 01:13:16.194
Bulanos. Bulanos, get ready.

903
01:13:21.783 --> 01:13:23.535
- Halt.
- You're not going to cause...


904
01:13:23.702 --> 01:13:27.581
more trouble for us. We're late.
You know how one cup leads to another.


905
01:13:27.748 --> 01:13:30.459
Be good fellows and stand aside
for the four clowns.


906
01:13:30.626 --> 01:13:33.378
Gentlemen, prepare.

907
01:13:46.433 --> 01:13:47.935
Let them pass.

908
01:14:07.621 --> 01:14:11.541
Brothers Bulano,
the bouncing Bavarians.


909
01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:11.351
Your nose is slipping.

910
01:15:19.651 --> 01:15:22.529
Rossi, can't you keep the bear
where it be...


911
01:15:26.533 --> 01:15:30.078
I'm really a very friendly bear
if I'm not crossed.


912
01:15:30.245 --> 01:15:32.539
I want you to announce
the Caramelli Brothers.


913
01:15:32.706 --> 01:15:35.542
The greatest acrobats in all of Europe.

914
01:15:37.044 --> 01:15:38.670
Stop.

915
01:15:41.048 --> 01:15:42.049
Your noble Grace.

916
01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:46.136
The most remarkable Brothers Caramelli,
acrobats supreme.


917
01:15:46.345 --> 01:15:50.015
Never before seen performing
in all Lombardy.


918
01:17:18.645 --> 01:17:21.023
I always said
we should have been acrobats.


919
01:17:21.815 --> 01:17:23.233
Dardo.

920
01:17:24.443 --> 01:17:27.154
Dardo. Dardo.

921
01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:29.364
Lock the boy in
the tower till I come.

922
01:17:29.615 --> 01:17:32.993
So this was the plan, marchese?
Arrest him.


923
01:17:41.168 --> 01:17:43.045
Surround the players.

924
01:17:47.341 --> 01:17:50.218
Are we going to let them do this
to players?


925
01:17:50.385 --> 01:17:53.013
- No.
- Well, then....


926
01:17:55.515 --> 01:17:58.810
They have the Bulanos.
They have the Bulanos.


927
01:18:08.362 --> 01:18:10.489
Mind the gate!

928
01:18:46.066 --> 01:18:48.735
Piccolo, the prisoners.

929
01:20:42.015 --> 01:20:44.059
Dardo. Dardo.

930
01:21:04.079 --> 01:21:05.539
Hey.

931
01:22:59.653 --> 01:23:02.489
Captain, hold them
as long as you can.


932
01:23:14.835 --> 01:23:18.213
Dardo! Dardo, he's gone for the boy.

933
01:23:35.188 --> 01:23:38.358
Your friends will be looking for you
in the great hall, marchese.


934
01:23:39.234 --> 01:23:41.153
I'm afraid you're right, Ulrich.

935
01:23:42.362 --> 01:23:44.531
I have lost the battle.

936
01:23:44.698 --> 01:23:48.410
I trust you will grant me the courtesy
of facing my defeat alone.


937
01:23:48.619 --> 01:23:51.371
But knowing you, dear Ulrich,
you've planned your escape.


938
01:23:51.538 --> 01:23:53.874
You're going for the boy
and I'm going with you.


939
01:23:54.124 --> 01:23:55.167
No.

940
01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:58.045
The truth is I betrayed them,
so we're going together.


941
01:23:58.211 --> 01:24:01.006
- We'd both be killed.
- I'll take that chance for us.


942
01:24:01.548 --> 01:24:03.675
You're the only thing
standing between me...


943
01:24:03.884 --> 01:24:05.719
and the vengeance
of my countrymen.


944
01:24:05.886 --> 01:24:08.013
You're no match for me
and you know it.


945
01:24:08.222 --> 01:24:09.681
Where's the boy?

946
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.185
There's the man who betrayed you.
Why don't you kill him?


947
01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:16.355
You need a sword. Take mine.

948
01:24:16.521 --> 01:24:19.399
- He'll kill you first.
- But you will defend me, Alessandro.


949
01:24:19.566 --> 01:24:21.944
As you say,
I am your only hope of escape.


950
01:24:22.194 --> 01:24:25.072
I can't fight you with a sword.
Listen, you want to escape.


951
01:24:25.239 --> 01:24:28.450
- I want my boy. I won't stop you.
- No, Dardo.


952
01:24:28.659 --> 01:24:32.246
I'm sorry I can't wait for the outcome.
I wish you both the best of luck.


953
01:24:32.412 --> 01:24:35.249
- Out of my way. I'm going for the boy.
- No, Dardo.


954
01:24:42.172 --> 01:24:45.259
Unfortunately your son
is Ulrich's escape. And mine.


955
01:25:07.281 --> 01:25:11.743
I regret that our happy days as outlaws
end like this, but I have to kill you.


956
01:25:32.764 --> 01:25:37.477
Now, marchese, we're in the dark,
where a sword is just a long knife.


957
01:25:37.644 --> 01:25:40.147
And hunters know all about knives.

958
01:25:42.232 --> 01:25:44.359
You can't see me,
can you, Alessandro?


959
01:25:44.526 --> 01:25:46.612
But I can see you.

960
01:25:46.945 --> 01:25:50.157
Be careful,
you're gonna trip over the chandelier.


961
01:25:55.621 --> 01:25:58.123
Now you've
got to come for me, Dardo.


962
01:26:37.579 --> 01:26:40.040
If anyone interferes,
the boy will pay for it.


963
01:27:00.227 --> 01:27:01.728
He'll hit the boy.

964
01:27:21.873 --> 01:27:23.584
Rudi.

965
01:27:26.753 --> 01:27:28.463
Piccolo.

966
01:28:28.982 --> 01:28:29.982
