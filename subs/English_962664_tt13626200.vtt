1
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:16.849
Hmm?

2
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:24.899
Holy shit.

3
00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:34.486
Great.

4
00:02:43.287 --> 00:02:45.205
Hey, Alexa, I finished
updating your computer.


5
00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.041
-Should be all set.
-Thanks, Trey.


6
00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:48.876
-Good morning.
-Where is he?


7
00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.544
-Where's who?
-That man-child


8
00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.421
you helped get a sales job
here a few months ago.


9
00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.465
-Ah, him. Haven't seen him.
-Well, if you do see him...


10
00:02:54.548 --> 00:02:55.925
Don't worry. I'll let him know.

11
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.343
Thank you!

12
00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.930
-Beep beep!
-Uh-huh.


13
00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:07.186
Hey, you wanted to see me?

14
00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.063
Great. You're both here.

15
00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:10.522
Both?

16
00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:11.607
How's it going, Parker?

17
00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:14.151
Well, it was going great,

18
00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:16.362
till I tried to pull into
my assigned parking spot,


19
00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:18.238
only to discover you couldn't
tell the difference


20
00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:20.199
between yours and mine... again.

21
00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:23.118
So you had to walk a couple spaces.
It's not that big of a deal.


22
00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.245
It's a big deal
because I earned that spot.


23
00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.164
And yet the short time
that I've been here,


24
00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:28.916
I've somehow managed
to close more deals than you.


25
00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.125
Check your figures, Crawford.

26
00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.127
I closed on Santone Ford last week.

27
00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.088
Eight car dealerships
up and down the West Coast.


28
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:35.339
Congratulations, Parker.

29
00:03:35.422 --> 00:03:36.840
King's Coffee Roasters, 22 shops.

30
00:03:36.924 --> 00:03:39.093
Bennington Books.
Contract goes out next week.


31
00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:42.096
Parttimerenters.com.
Contract came in last night.


32
00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.014
I've been at this company 9 1/2 years.

33
00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:45.349
You've been here, what, a minute?

34
00:03:45.432 --> 00:03:47.226
Imagine what I could do with 90 seconds.

35
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.854
The two of you bicker
just like my parents,


36
00:03:50.938 --> 00:03:52.439
but I love it.

37
00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:55.526
You know why?
Because your competitive nature


38
00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.444
brings out the best in both of you.

39
00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:59.989
Plus I know that you'll go out
and close another deal,


40
00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.740
just to get the other one back.

41
00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.075
Oh, before I forget...

42
00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:05.995
-Happy Birthday.
-Oh, thank you.


43
00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:07.287
-It's your birthday?
-Yeah.


44
00:04:07.371 --> 00:04:09.164
Congratulations on turning
another year older.


45
00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:11.083
You did it! And it shows.

46
00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:13.377
How about a birthday hug?

47
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.337
Huh? No?

48
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.256
So, you wanted to see me.

49
00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.509
-Yes, I did.
-Oh, you wanted to see her too?


50
00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:22.344
Yeah, both of you. 
Have a seat, please.

51
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.474
Uh, wait, shouldn't Jacqueline be here?

52
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:30.019
Well, Jacqueline, it turns out,

53
00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:33.105
accepted a position
over at Bernstein and Barlow,


54
00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:34.648
effective immediately.

55
00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:38.027
So, that means I need
a new director of sales.


56
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.990
And I'm looking at my two best prospects.

57
00:04:43.073 --> 00:04:44.533
How do I get the job?

58
00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.827
What she means
is how do I get the job?


59
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.454
There's a potential client,

60
00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:52.332
which could be worth
a lot of money for this firm.


61
00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:54.293
I'm sure you're both familiar
with Goodwin Wines.


62
00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:55.878
-Mm.
-No.


63
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.422
Oh, you wouldn't.
They make grown-up drinks.


64
00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:01.592
Well, turns out Craig Goodwin,
the owner of the company,


65
00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:03.927
is in the market
for a new ad firm,

66
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:10.059
so I've decided whichever one of you
gets him to sign gets the promotion.


67
00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:12.102
Wait. Whichever one of you?

68
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.147
Ah.

69
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.567
Speak of the devil and
he shall appear at your door.


70
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.280
Craig Goodwin,
please meet Alexa and Jason.


71
00:05:23.363 --> 00:05:27.201
These are the two fabulous sales reps
that I was telling you about.


72
00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:31.455
Mm-hmm. Well, two of the things
I love in this world are...


73
00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:34.416
keeping folks on their toes,

74
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.753
especially those I'm considering
going into business with,


75
00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:42.091
and the other is
good old-fashioned competition.


76
00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.009
To the victor go the spoils.

77
00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:46.720
Who's Victor? I thought
it was between me and Parker.


78
00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:49.098
Isn't it?

79
00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:52.726
Ah?

80
00:05:54.853 --> 00:05:58.190
Ah, I'm kidding, right?

81
00:05:58.273 --> 00:06:00.734
You didn't say your guy was funny too.

82
00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:02.319
I can be funny.

83
00:06:02.402 --> 00:06:04.780
Well, young lady, 
I am looking forward

84
00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:08.826
to hearing your ideas about
how to boost my company.


85
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.036
-Debra?
-Hmm?


86
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.246
The presentation.

87
00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:15.833
Can I expect it
on or by the 10th?

88
00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:18.127
-They'll be ready.
-Say, um...


89
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.170
you wouldn't happen
to play golf, would you?


90
00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:22.965
Only... every weekend.

91
00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:26.468
I've got a hookup over at the Larson
Country Club, if you're interested.


92
00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.596
Larson? Man, I've been dying
to play that course.


93
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.224
Anytime you want to hit
the links, you just let me know.


94
00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:34.685
Good start, Jason.

95
00:06:36.436 --> 00:06:38.397
Okay, Craig and I
have much to discuss,


96
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.149
and if I were the two of you,

97
00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:42.401
I would do everything you could
to win over our new friend.


98
00:06:42.484 --> 00:06:43.861
Mm-hmm.

99
00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:46.446
Okay.

100
00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:49.283
Parker, wait up.

101
00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:51.910
Say, you wouldn't happen
to play golf, would you?


102
00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.579
You got to learn to read the room.

103
00:06:53.662 --> 00:06:55.247
He had a tag on his computer bag.

104
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.957
-You know what?
-Let me guess.


105
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.126
You've given it some thought,
and you want to concede.


106
00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:00.878
No judgment. Really.

107
00:07:00.961 --> 00:07:02.462
Come on, we'll tell them together.

108
00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:04.381
Keep talking, Crawford. Pretty soon,

109
00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:07.134
it'll be about the time you
almost got that director's job.


110
00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:09.011
Don't you want to save yourself
the embarrassment--


111
00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:11.722
Of defeating you?
Why would I want to do that?


112
00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:14.349
I better not find your car
in my space tomorrow.


113
00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:23.275
Guess who's gonna be the Driscoll Group's
new director of sales?


114
00:07:23.358 --> 00:07:24.943
Debra offered you the promotion?

115
00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:28.238
Well, no, not exactly, but there's
only two of us in the running.


116
00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:29.323
Who's the other one?

117
00:07:29.406 --> 00:07:31.074
Alexa Parker?

118
00:07:31.158 --> 00:07:32.576
Yeah, but I wouldn't worry about it.

119
00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.578
She's been here, what, six years?

120
00:07:34.661 --> 00:07:35.954
Nine.

121
00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:38.749
Exactly. It's time for some new blood.

122
00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:43.795
Besides, that new assisted-living place
to move my mom into?


123
00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.339
I can really use the raise.

124
00:07:45.422 --> 00:07:47.257
Like you said,
with the new house and all...


125
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.176
You're not the least bit intimidated?

126
00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:52.179
I have worked here since I was in school.
I've earned this.


127
00:07:52.262 --> 00:07:54.640
He has brought in some pretty big clients.

128
00:07:54.723 --> 00:07:57.309
Wait, you think she has a chance?

129
00:07:57.392 --> 00:08:00.103
I don't know. I mean,
if you weren't so busy


130
00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:03.482
fighting with her all the time,
think she might surprise you.


131
00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:06.193
Ah, please. She's nothing special.

132
00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:10.113
Come on, you can't tell me
he's not a little charming.


133
00:08:10.197 --> 00:08:12.783
He is a salesman, Hannah.
That's what they do.


134
00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:16.328
So, there's not a little incy-wincy part
of you that finds him attractive?


135
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:18.830
I guess one would admit

136
00:08:18.914 --> 00:08:21.833
that she is technically
an attractive woman.


137
00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:25.545
Mm. You wonder if she's still
got that same boyfriend.


138
00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:29.508
Pleased to let you know I know
nothing about her personal life.


139
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:33.470
Besides, I'm very happily involved.

140
00:08:33.553 --> 00:08:35.931
Does Perry have anything special
planned for your birthday?


141
00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:38.308
He's taking me to lunch
at The Belvedere.


142
00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:40.435
Ooh, fancy!

143
00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.145
You should have seen him
when he asked me.


144
00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:44.398
Hannah, he was so nervous.

145
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:46.692
Wait, you don't think he's going to--

146
00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:48.485
I don't wanna jinx it, but...

147
00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:52.990
How are things with, uh,
what's-her-name anyway?


148
00:08:53.073 --> 00:08:54.199
Julia?

149
00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:55.993
Yeah. I get 'em all mixed up.

150
00:08:56.076 --> 00:08:57.619
It's been six months.

151
00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:01.581
Ooh! That's practically
an eternity in Jason time.


152
00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:03.834
Dang! This could be the one.

153
00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:06.253
-She knows I'm not that guy.
-Ah.


154
00:09:06.336 --> 00:09:07.921
And what guy is that?

155
00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:12.217
Oh, the overly needy boyfriend,

156
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.970
one that's always talking about
the future, making promises,


157
00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:17.139
planning out the next 15 years, you know.

158
00:09:17.222 --> 00:09:21.226
And you're sure you're not talking
about what you don't want?


159
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.145
She gets me.

160
00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:24.646
You know, we communicate without words.

161
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.191
Uh-huh. Just a couple of mimes
in love, huh?


162
00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:30.652
Yeah.

163
00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.487
Oh, I gotta go. 
I'm gonna be late.

164
00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.907
Okay, good luck. I know, I know.
I won't jinx it. Bye.


165
00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:52.799
I know, I get it.
Yes. Hundred percent.


166
00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:54.885
I know. Yeah, you're right.
No, you're right.


167
00:09:54.968 --> 00:09:56.762
You're right. I gotta go.

168
00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:00.807
Sorry I'm late, baby.

169
00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:05.020
Uh, such a crazy morning.

170
00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:06.521
I can't wait to
tell you all about it.

171
00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:07.856
Who were you talking to?

172
00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:09.608
My, uh, my life coach.

173
00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:11.693
So, you decided to do it.

174
00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.153
It was such great advice.
I can't thank you enough.


175
00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:16.573
You remember last year when I was
stressing over that one account?


176
00:10:16.656 --> 00:10:18.867
It did wonders for me.

177
00:10:23.288 --> 00:10:24.331
Is something wrong?

178
00:10:24.414 --> 00:10:26.124
Nothing.

179
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.876
Nothing.

180
00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:33.757
Actually, there is something
I need to talk about.


181
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.509
-Um...
-Oh?


182
00:10:35.592 --> 00:10:38.220
Alex, I've been doing a lot of thinking

183
00:10:38.303 --> 00:10:41.681
about things, about us,
about these last 10 months.


184
00:10:41.765 --> 00:10:42.766
Uh-huh.

185
00:10:42.849 --> 00:10:47.562
And I think, well, that it's...

186
00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.564
It's time for us to, uh...

187
00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:50.649
Yes?

188
00:10:50.732 --> 00:10:52.067
To break up.

189
00:10:53.693 --> 00:10:55.404
-Wait, what?
-I know.


190
00:10:55.487 --> 00:10:57.572
I hate that I'm doing this,
but my life coach thinks that--


191
00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:00.450
Wait, the life coach I recommended?

192
00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:03.412
She thinks that in order
to achieve my potential,


193
00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:05.372
I need to be unattached.

194
00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:07.833
You are attached. To me.

195
00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:09.418
I know.

196
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:10.919
But we have plans for the future.

197
00:11:11.002 --> 00:11:12.337
No. You have plans.

198
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:14.214
Honestly, I don't even know
what I want anymore.


199
00:11:14.297 --> 00:11:17.426
Is this a joke?
Am I being recorded?


200
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:18.969
I know the timing isn't great.

201
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.640
I'm being dumped... on my birthday.

202
00:11:23.723 --> 00:11:26.601
Oh, yeah, right, I forgot.

203
00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:27.727
Happy Birthday.

204
00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:29.646
This isn't happening.

205
00:11:29.729 --> 00:11:32.023
I-
-Actually, I gotta go.

206
00:11:32.107 --> 00:11:34.526
I have, like, a Zoom session
with her in-in 30 minutes.


207
00:11:34.609 --> 00:11:35.986
She'd wanna know how this went.

208
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:39.030
But, uh, I really am sorry.

209
00:11:39.114 --> 00:11:40.740
You're a great woman, Alex.

210
00:11:40.824 --> 00:11:41.825
-What?
-Bye.


211
00:11:47.205 --> 00:11:48.582
Okay.

212
00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:57.466
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

213
00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:00.469
Great! I hate technology.

214
00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:03.013
This is an awful place you work.

215
00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:04.347
Just awful!

216
00:12:12.147 --> 00:12:14.065
I'm such a fool.

217
00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:15.942
I'm sure I.T. can get you another one.

218
00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:17.652
I'm not talking about the phone.

219
00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:20.280
I mean, I actually thought
he was gonna propose.


220
00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:22.365
It's such a clichÃ©, right?
My whole life's a clichÃ©.


221
00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:24.117
Not your whole life.

222
00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:27.871
One of these things is getting
the client to understand.


223
00:12:27.954 --> 00:12:29.831
Oh, there she is.

224
00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.418
-Hi, Brad.
-Hey, Hannah.


225
00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:36.796
So, what are you two
scheming about over here?


226
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:41.343
Well, if you must know,
we were just, uh, strategizing


227
00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:43.595
about how I'm gonna get that account.

228
00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:46.181
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.


229
00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:49.184
Come on, Brad. Let me show you
what I'm working on.


230
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.356
-Brad.
-Hmm?


231
00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:57.192
-Let me show you.
-Oh, yeah.


232
00:12:59.152 --> 00:13:00.570
Uh, what was that?

233
00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:02.531
What was--That was--
That was nothing.


234
00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:04.241
What were we talking about again?

235
00:13:04.324 --> 00:13:06.076
-My broken heart.
-Right.


236
00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:08.495
Well, there's no one better
at talking the heartbroken


237
00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:10.789
off the ledge of despair
than Alexa Parker.


238
00:13:10.872 --> 00:13:14.125
You're like... the breakup whisperer.

239
00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:16.002
Well, who's gonna whisper at my breakup?

240
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.379
Well, you can always call me.

241
00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.214
Uh, eventually.

242
00:13:20.632 --> 00:13:21.967
Is it working?

243
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.636
It's as dead as my love.

244
00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:27.639
Well, at least you backed it up
to the cloud, right?


245
00:13:28.723 --> 00:13:31.560
Ugh! I hate technology!

246
00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:35.647
Oh, here you go.

247
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.732
-A brand-new work phone.
-Thank you.


248
00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:40.277
Yeah, okay, I've got some cases
you might be interested in.


249
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.697
That's okay. I don't really plan on
dropping it into another bucket of water.


250
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.282
Here's the one I use.

251
00:13:45.365 --> 00:13:47.325
Plastic screen protector, rubber casing.

252
00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:49.536
It'll keep her safe
if it falls out of your pocket


253
00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:52.080
-or slips off your desk.
-Yeah, but I'm good. I just... I...


254
00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:54.040
They call this one the lifeboat.

255
00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:55.917
It'll withstand about a foot of water,

256
00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.753
so in case you feel like playing
Angry Birds in the bathtub or something.


257
00:13:58.837 --> 00:13:59.838
Yeah, not really.

258
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:01.548
Okay.

259
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:05.719
This one right here, this is the tank.

260
00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:09.598
That's aircraft-grade
aluminum right there.


261
00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:11.308
You can get a running start
and punt kick this


262
00:14:11.391 --> 00:14:14.811
off the Transamerica building,
and it won't even crack the screen.


263
00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:17.480
Here.

264
00:14:17.564 --> 00:14:18.607
Oh!

265
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.150
You feel that? Strong, huh?

266
00:14:20.233 --> 00:14:22.444
-Yeah, it's heavy.
-You can keep it.


267
00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:24.779
No, no, you--
I think I'm good with this.


268
00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:27.282
Thank you, though. 
I appreciate it.

269
00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:29.326
Hey, do me a favor
and backup your phone this time.


270
00:14:29.409 --> 00:14:30.410
Yep!

271
00:14:40.253 --> 00:14:42.422
Hey, Julia, I'm home.

272
00:14:45.008 --> 00:14:49.262
You know, I was thinking,
why don't we get some takeout tonight?


273
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:52.932
What was the name of that
Italian place you wanted to go to?


274
00:14:53.016 --> 00:14:54.434
Um...

275
00:15:02.025 --> 00:15:04.819
"Dear Jason,
I can't do this anymore.


276
00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:07.656
I need to be with someone
whose idea of romance


277
00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:11.993
doesn't end with a jokey
Valentine's Day card."


278
00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.828
I gave that to you with love.

279
00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:17.749
I know you think you're here with me,
but you're really not.


280
00:15:17.832 --> 00:15:20.251
Goodbye. Julia.

281
00:15:35.475 --> 00:15:36.601
Life coach.

282
00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:58.498
-Hey!
-Hey, there he is.


283
00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:01.334
What, uh... What number
are you calling me from?


284
00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:05.463
Oh, sorry. Work cell.

285
00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:08.633
Ah. So, uh, what up?

286
00:16:08.717 --> 00:16:10.176
What are you doing right now?

287
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.304
I have to work on this
presentation thing. Why?


288
00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:16.224
Wanna come over?
Play some Madden? Order pizza?


289
00:16:16.307 --> 00:16:19.769
On a school night! Bad boy!

290
00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:22.772
What's, uh... What's really going on?

291
00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:25.567
Julia left me.

292
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.446
Wait, what? I thought you guys
were a couple of mimes in love.


293
00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:31.865
Yeah. Guess it's true.

294
00:16:31.948 --> 00:16:34.743
Everyone hates mimes.

295
00:16:34.826 --> 00:16:38.371
Well, I mean, if it means anything,
I'm sorry.


296
00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:42.041
If you're really sorry, you'd come over
and watch me beat you in Madden.


297
00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:45.211
I thought you weren't
the overly needy boyfriend.


298
00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:47.505
-I'm not.
-All right.


299
00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:50.884
Then it's all good.
Don't sweat it. You got this.


300
00:16:52.385 --> 00:16:54.220
Yeah.

301
00:16:54.304 --> 00:16:55.472
You're right.

302
00:16:55.555 --> 00:16:56.806
See you tomorrow?

303
00:16:58.391 --> 00:17:00.101
Yeah.

304
00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.896
All right. Bye, dude.

305
00:17:02.979 --> 00:17:04.189
Bye.

306
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:15.408
Who actually remembers
phone numbers these days?


307
00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:24.501
555-01...

308
00:17:26.753 --> 00:17:28.296
2-8?

309
00:17:28.379 --> 00:17:30.089
8-2?

310
00:17:31.591 --> 00:17:33.176
0-1-8-2.

311
00:17:38.139 --> 00:17:39.682
Hey, it's me.

312
00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:41.684
I'm sorry in advance
for the extended text,


313
00:17:41.768 --> 00:17:44.979
but I just don't feel like
talking right now.


314
00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:48.024
And, to be honest, I don't feel
like doing much of anything right now


315
00:17:48.107 --> 00:17:50.652
besides drinking merlot
and crying my heart out.


316
00:17:55.907 --> 00:17:58.326
But hey, I heard red wine's
good for the heart,


317
00:17:58.409 --> 00:18:01.496
so maybe the night
will end up a wash.

318
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.299
Wrong number.

319
00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:23.810
My heart feels like
it's been torn out of my chest,


320
00:18:23.893 --> 00:18:25.770
thrown on the floor and stomped on,

321
00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:27.772
like someone was turning
a bucket of grapes


322
00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:29.816
into my next glass of vino.

323
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.529
Wrong number, whoever you are.

324
00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:40.159
Next glass of vino.

325
00:18:40.243 --> 00:18:43.580
Could use that for the Goodwin pitch.

326
00:18:43.663 --> 00:18:46.249
Let's play, let's play, let's play!

327
00:18:46.332 --> 00:18:48.334
And you are
preaching to the choir.


328
00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:55.675
Are you there?

329
00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:03.600
I am, but I don't think
I'm the you you're looking for.


330
00:19:06.227 --> 00:19:08.187
I think you texted the wrong number.

331
00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:12.609
Uh, sorry. New phone.

332
00:19:17.989 --> 00:19:19.824
No worries.

333
00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:23.745
I can't remember anybody's
number by heart either.


334
00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:26.039
You probably think
I'm some depressed lunatic.


335
00:19:28.207 --> 00:19:30.209
It happens.

336
00:19:30.293 --> 00:19:33.004
To be honest, it's happening
to me right now too.


337
00:19:36.382 --> 00:19:37.926
Did you get dumped too?

338
00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:40.553
About an hour ago.

339
00:19:43.181 --> 00:19:46.392
Must be something in the air.
I'm so sorry.


340
00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:50.021
Really? When did yours go down?

341
00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:52.315
Over lunch.

342
00:19:52.398 --> 00:19:54.442
At least tell me it was delicious.

343
00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:57.320
I didn't even get to order,

344
00:19:57.403 --> 00:20:00.031
but I did manage to drop my
phone in a bucket of melted ice,


345
00:20:00.114 --> 00:20:01.574
so there's that.

346
00:20:03.451 --> 00:20:04.911
Which is how we got here.

347
00:20:04.994 --> 00:20:07.372
Which is how we got here.

348
00:20:07.455 --> 00:20:09.457
It reminds me of a quote:

349
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.544
"The more I know of the world,
the more I am convinced


350
00:20:13.628 --> 00:20:16.673
I shall never see a man
whom I can really love."


351
00:20:18.341 --> 00:20:20.635
Whoa. You've read
Sense and Sensibility?


352
00:20:21.344 --> 00:20:22.428
It's a classic.

353
00:20:23.012 --> 00:20:25.723
Perry, my ex, thought it was corny.

354
00:20:26.724 --> 00:20:28.017
Julie would say the same thing.

355
00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:31.104
She would say, "Why are you
wasting your time with that?"


356
00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:34.357
What do they know, right?

357
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.692
You know, it's a great movie.

358
00:20:37.902 --> 00:20:39.320
Would you believe I've never seen it?

359
00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:40.571
You're kidding.

360
00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:45.034
I don't know. I never like
when they make books into movies.


361
00:20:46.577 --> 00:20:48.538
You should see what they did
with Anne Steele.


362
00:20:48.621 --> 00:20:50.039
Hey, no spoilers.

363
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:53.084
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:55.795
But seriously, you gotta watch it.

365
00:20:57.088 --> 00:20:59.924
I'll put it on the list. Happy?

366
00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:02.510
Very.

367
00:21:11.894 --> 00:21:14.439
I should probably go wallow
in my misery for a while.


368
00:21:17.483 --> 00:21:20.278
Yeah, I should do the same thing.

369
00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:25.199
Thanks for the chat, though.
I think it helped.


370
00:21:26.617 --> 00:21:27.618
Me too.

371
00:21:28.786 --> 00:21:29.787
Good night.

372
00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:32.665
Good night.

373
00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:38.106
Hmm.

374
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.661
Hey, Cheryl.

375
00:22:51.744 --> 00:22:53.579
Hey, Parker.

376
00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:55.456
Crawford. You can try
and distract me all you want.


377
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.208
It's not gonna work.

378
00:22:57.291 --> 00:23:00.419
The fact that you're even saying the word
"distract" implies that it's working.


379
00:23:00.503 --> 00:23:01.921
Let's make a deal.

380
00:23:02.004 --> 00:23:05.133
I'll stay out of your face this week,
and you stay out of mine.


381
00:23:05.216 --> 00:23:06.968
Eh. Deal.

382
00:23:07.051 --> 00:23:08.344
Deal.

383
00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:12.390
I'm getting that promotion.

384
00:23:12.473 --> 00:23:14.392
Finally, we have something in common.

385
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.108
Growing up here
in this beautiful vineyard,


386
00:23:22.191 --> 00:23:24.110
I'm reminded that Goodwin Wines

387
00:23:24.193 --> 00:23:26.612
is more than just a family business.

388
00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:28.614
It's a way of life.

389
00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:31.284
It is our great privilege
to continue to bring


390
00:23:31.367 --> 00:23:34.996
the best chardonnay
and cabernet grapes to the world.


391
00:23:43.754 --> 00:23:44.881
Knock knock.

392
00:23:44.964 --> 00:23:46.382
Hey.

393
00:23:46.465 --> 00:23:48.092
Uh, what's your phone number?

394
00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:49.760
I know Perry just dumped you,

395
00:23:49.844 --> 00:23:52.346
but you should know
I am nobody's rebound.


396
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.265
Very funny. What is it?

397
00:23:54.348 --> 00:23:57.685
555-0128.

398
00:23:57.768 --> 00:24:00.188
2-8. I had 8-2.

399
00:24:00.271 --> 00:24:02.565
I'm lost.

400
00:24:02.648 --> 00:24:04.859
Okay, you know I had to get
a new phone yesterday, right?


401
00:24:04.942 --> 00:24:07.028
I still think you should have
gone for the waterproof case.


402
00:24:07.111 --> 00:24:09.906
Well, I was still feeling pretty
bad when I got home and...


403
00:24:09.989 --> 00:24:11.407
You should text me, silly.

404
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.327
Well, I did, or at
least I thought I did.

405
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.080
Wait. You didn't know my number?

406
00:24:19.165 --> 00:24:21.584
I'm your best friend!
How do you not know my number?


407
00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.669
Oh, come on. Who knows
anyone's number anymore?


408
00:24:23.753 --> 00:24:26.255
-I know yours.
-Yeah, well...


409
00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:29.967
Wait, are you telling me that
you sent a broken heart text


410
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:31.719
to the wrong person?

411
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.263
Oh, no.

412
00:24:34.347 --> 00:24:37.183
Yeah, and I really poured
my heart out on that thing too.


413
00:24:37.266 --> 00:24:39.143
So, what happened?

414
00:24:39.227 --> 00:24:40.686
What do you mean, what happened?

415
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.688
Were they mean?
Did they make fun of you? What?


416
00:24:42.772 --> 00:24:44.273
Quite the opposite, actually.

417
00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:45.942
The same thing just happened to him.

418
00:24:46.025 --> 00:24:47.318
It was a him.

419
00:24:47.902 --> 00:24:50.446
So, like, how long did you guys
message each other?


420
00:24:50.529 --> 00:24:52.323
I mean, not that long, you know.

421
00:24:52.406 --> 00:24:56.410
But it's nice knowing not every guy out
there is a complete asshole.


422
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:05.127
And you're telling me you have
no idea who this woman is.


423
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:06.212
None.

424
00:25:06.295 --> 00:25:09.131
No names, no pictures?

425
00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:11.217
It was freeing that way.

426
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.469
I wasn't concerned about being judged.

427
00:25:13.552 --> 00:25:16.514
Wait a minute. You opened up
to this stranger...


428
00:25:16.597 --> 00:25:18.015
about your feelings?

429
00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:20.142
Brad, don't get crazy, all right?

430
00:25:26.565 --> 00:25:27.984
Maybe it's Julia.

431
00:25:29.235 --> 00:25:30.278
It's not Julia.

432
00:25:31.362 --> 00:25:34.448
You're sure she's not
playing some mind games,


433
00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:37.076
checking in on how her boy is doing?

434
00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:39.662
I think I would know
if I was being catfished.


435
00:25:39.745 --> 00:25:43.791
Ah, right, because you're
Mr. Sensitive now.


436
00:25:43.874 --> 00:25:47.545
And speaking of which, what is this?

437
00:25:47.628 --> 00:25:49.213
What? It's a good book.

438
00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:51.173
This is chick lit, man.

439
00:25:51.257 --> 00:25:54.135
Don't tell me you've actually
been reading this, have you?


440
00:25:55.553 --> 00:25:57.138
Heck no. It's Julia's.

441
00:25:57.221 --> 00:25:58.639
I found it after she left.

442
00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.349
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.


443
00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:01.434
Okay.

444
00:26:07.106 --> 00:26:09.442
Hmm...

445
00:26:09.525 --> 00:26:11.610
Maybe it's her.

446
00:26:11.694 --> 00:26:13.279
Get after it.

447
00:26:14.697 --> 00:26:16.240
Playa, playa.

448
00:26:19.243 --> 00:26:20.286
It's my mom.

449
00:26:21.954 --> 00:26:23.414
Is it really that funny, huh?

450
00:26:23.497 --> 00:26:26.000
What, your virtual
rebound girl? Mm-mm.


451
00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:27.960
Hey, she is a real person, all right?

452
00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:31.047
Hey, and you're a real mime, all right?

453
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:32.465
Remember that.

454
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.391
I had grilled cheese for lunch, Mom.

455
00:27:26.602 --> 00:27:30.022
Who wants to have a ladies' happy hour
and watch The Bachelor?


456
00:27:30.106 --> 00:27:31.816
Come on.

457
00:27:31.899 --> 00:27:35.152
At least I can call this
research for my pitch, right?


458
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.905
That's the spirit, no pun intended.

459
00:27:39.698 --> 00:27:40.699
Oh.

460
00:27:45.037 --> 00:27:47.289
Do you think it's bad to drink
after a breakup?


461
00:27:47.373 --> 00:27:50.084
That's what you told me
the last time I got dumped.


462
00:27:50.167 --> 00:27:54.130
Why is it so much easier
to dole out advice than it is to take it?


463
00:27:55.506 --> 00:27:56.674
Ooh, ah.

464
00:27:56.757 --> 00:27:59.009
Every time I burn my hand.

465
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.979
Virtual rebound girl.

466
00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:20.823
Well?

467
00:28:21.907 --> 00:28:23.409
Nothing.

468
00:28:24.493 --> 00:28:27.705
You could always text him... again.

469
00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:32.585
I think I need more wine.

470
00:28:32.668 --> 00:28:34.086
Cheers to that.

471
00:28:43.637 --> 00:28:45.264
It's a onetime thing.

472
00:28:45.347 --> 00:28:48.934
She realized she's made a mistake.
She's moved on.


473
00:28:59.653 --> 00:29:01.071
I mean, that could be anyone.

474
00:29:02.656 --> 00:29:04.909
There's only one way to find out.

475
00:29:08.579 --> 00:29:10.915
-It's him.
-I knew it.


476
00:29:10.998 --> 00:29:13.125
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

477
00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:17.671
I'm not here.

478
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:21.675
Hi. Nope.

479
00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:25.721
Just sitting here alone, doing research.

480
00:29:30.434 --> 00:29:31.519
Me too.

481
00:29:32.686 --> 00:29:34.355
Oh, tell him what happened.

482
00:29:35.481 --> 00:29:39.235
You're gonna laugh, but I figured out
what happened last night.


483
00:29:39.318 --> 00:29:42.905
So, I got the last two digits of my
best friend's phone number backwards.


484
00:29:42.988 --> 00:29:44.532
Funny, huh?

485
00:29:44.615 --> 00:29:46.700
Who remembers
anybody's number anymore?


486
00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:49.036
You-
-That's it.

487
00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:51.205
You both are made for each other.

488
00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:53.624
Oh, ask for a picture.

489
00:29:53.707 --> 00:29:55.709
Oh, no, I'm not gonna do that.

490
00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:58.128
He could be homely.

491
00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.339
He could be hot.

492
00:30:01.257 --> 00:30:03.175
Look, I don't want
to ruin what we have.

493
00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:05.135
And I'm serious. 
It's not like that.

494
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.598
Well, text me later
and tell me how it goes.


495
00:30:09.682 --> 00:30:11.141
All right, I will.

496
00:30:13.018 --> 00:30:17.565
You could get a name and make sure
there's not a podcast about this guy.


497
00:30:18.148 --> 00:30:20.109
Very funny. Love you, girl.

498
00:30:20.192 --> 00:30:21.485
Love ya.

499
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:30.995
So, should we exchange names?

500
00:30:32.246 --> 00:30:34.206
I like it better this way.

501
00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.918
No names, no work
talk, no reason to lie.

502
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:41.171
But we need to
call each other something.


503
00:30:41.255 --> 00:30:45.301
Jack and Jill, Bonnie and Clyde,
Sonny and Cher?


504
00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.180
How about...

505
00:30:51.265 --> 00:30:52.766
Him and Her?

506
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.271
Perfect.

507
00:30:58.689 --> 00:31:00.190
So, what are you doing?

508
00:31:02.109 --> 00:31:04.153
Watching reality television,
drinking wine,


509
00:31:04.236 --> 00:31:05.988
and wondering
where my life went wrong.


510
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:07.406
How about you?

511
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.159
Just finishing off dinner.

512
00:31:10.993 --> 00:31:12.161
Oh, you cook?

513
00:31:13.495 --> 00:31:15.414
Yep. Made it myself.

514
00:31:19.209 --> 00:31:21.253
So, what are we watching?

515
00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:24.757
Oh, no, no, no.

516
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.217
I am not watching The Bachelor with you.

517
00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:30.971
You won't watch Sense and Sensibility,
but you'll watch The Bachelor?


518
00:31:32.514 --> 00:31:35.643
To be honest,
I'd rather just talk to you.


519
00:31:38.395 --> 00:31:39.396
Me too.

520
00:31:42.483 --> 00:31:43.484
Really?

521
00:31:43.567 --> 00:31:48.322
Yeah. I thought it was cool how you
put your feelings out there like that...


522
00:31:49.406 --> 00:31:51.408
even if you did
think I was your friend.

523
00:31:53.744 --> 00:31:57.373
I needed to vent to someone.
I'm not mad it was you.


524
00:31:57.456 --> 00:32:01.085
Besides, I'd say we're friends
now, wouldn't you?


525
00:32:02.544 --> 00:32:04.004
I guess so.

526
00:32:04.588 --> 00:32:06.715
I take it you're not
the touchy-feely type.


527
00:32:09.968 --> 00:32:12.680
I think my ex would probably say no.

528
00:32:17.184 --> 00:32:19.186
Can I be honest with you
about something?


529
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:20.813
Of course.

530
00:32:23.482 --> 00:32:26.026
I've never actually
told a woman that I love her.


531
00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:29.947
Really?

532
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.409
Well, did your parents say it
to each other a lot growing up?


533
00:32:33.492 --> 00:32:35.911
As much as any other parents, I suppose.

534
00:32:37.496 --> 00:32:38.747
Are you close?

535
00:32:39.331 --> 00:32:40.416
To my mom.

536
00:32:42.084 --> 00:32:44.044
My dad passed away
a couple years ago.


537
00:32:44.753 --> 00:32:45.963
I'm sorry to hear that.

538
00:32:47.047 --> 00:32:49.049
Both my parents are gone.

539
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.179
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:55.472 --> 00:32:57.182
I was always close with my mom.

541
00:32:59.017 --> 00:33:02.187
Sometimes I have these dreams
about my dad, and when I wake up...


542
00:33:03.897 --> 00:33:06.358
it's like I've lost him all over again.

543
00:33:10.946 --> 00:33:13.240
You do realize you just
opened up to a woman, right?


544
00:33:15.325 --> 00:33:16.618
Oh, bite your tongue.

545
00:33:21.915 --> 00:33:23.834
But I know exactly what you mean.

546
00:33:23.917 --> 00:33:25.544
I have those dreams too.

547
00:33:27.838 --> 00:33:30.674
I've always imagined my dad
walking me down the aisle,


548
00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:35.012
or that my mother would be there
playing with her grandkids.


549
00:33:36.805 --> 00:33:38.307
Why do people have to get old?

550
00:33:41.018 --> 00:33:42.686
Right?

551
00:33:44.772 --> 00:33:48.150
You know, I don't think I've talked
to anyone about this before.


552
00:33:50.694 --> 00:33:53.614
Me neither, not for a long time anyway.

553
00:33:55.699 --> 00:33:56.700
Guess I should thank you...

554
00:33:57.701 --> 00:33:59.453
for getting me out of my comfort zone.

555
00:34:00.954 --> 00:34:02.456
I needed it.

556
00:34:02.539 --> 00:34:03.999
No worries.

557
00:34:05.709 --> 00:34:07.169
I needed it too.

558
00:34:10.088 --> 00:34:11.423
I better get going.

559
00:34:11.507 --> 00:34:13.050
I have an early meeting in the morning.

560
00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:16.512
Me too.

561
00:34:16.595 --> 00:34:18.096
Good night, Her.

562
00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:24.686
Good night, Him.

563
00:34:53.423 --> 00:34:54.758
So...

564
00:34:54.842 --> 00:34:59.680
this is our top cab from 2007,

565
00:34:59.763 --> 00:35:03.141
and one of my absolute favorites.

566
00:35:03.225 --> 00:35:05.602
Did I read that cabernet sauvignon

567
00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:08.480
is the most planted wine grape
in the whole world?


568
00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:10.691
And with very good reason.

569
00:35:10.774 --> 00:35:11.984
You're quite right.

570
00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:14.695
Thank you.

571
00:35:14.778 --> 00:35:16.113
Well...

572
00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:18.824
-Salut.
-It's good.


573
00:35:22.411 --> 00:35:23.412
Mmm.

574
00:35:23.495 --> 00:35:24.621
Mm-hmm.

575
00:35:25.747 --> 00:35:28.750
Alexa, your considered opinion, please.

576
00:35:29.334 --> 00:35:30.544
It's fruity.

577
00:35:30.627 --> 00:35:32.963
I'm detecting notes of
black currant and black cherry


578
00:35:33.046 --> 00:35:35.507
with festive notes of green pepper,

579
00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:38.677
spice notes of vanilla and clove
from the oak barrels.


580
00:35:39.761 --> 00:35:40.762
Very good.

581
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.308
And you, sir.

582
00:35:46.018 --> 00:35:49.563
I'm feeling some rich, complex flavors.

583
00:35:50.564 --> 00:35:53.025
Strawberries,

584
00:35:53.108 --> 00:35:55.152
sporty spice...

585
00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:58.697
...and some hints of cedar and caramel.

586
00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.532
Mm-hmm.

587
00:36:01.116 --> 00:36:04.494
Jason, you strike me as
a beer and wings kind of guy,


588
00:36:04.578 --> 00:36:05.746
but don't worry.

589
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:09.082
I love hops just
as much as the grape.

590
00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:12.711
Ah, a beer-drinking man.
I knew it, I knew it.


591
00:36:13.545 --> 00:36:15.672
However, wouldn't you agree
that one should have


592
00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:17.716
some knowledge of the product?

593
00:36:17.799 --> 00:36:19.760
Yeah, well, you don't need
to drive a Maserati


594
00:36:19.843 --> 00:36:22.137
to know how to
sell one, am I right?

595
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.472
Right on.

596
00:36:23.555 --> 00:36:24.640
Mm-hmm.

597
00:36:28.477 --> 00:36:30.437
You know, I think I'm gonna take
a look around the property.


598
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.397
-See what comes to me.
-Good idea.


599
00:36:33.231 --> 00:36:35.192
I think I'll do the same thing.

600
00:36:35.275 --> 00:36:36.902
-Fine.
-Fine.


601
00:36:41.448 --> 00:36:42.449
Told you.

602
00:36:43.742 --> 00:36:45.369
Interesting duo.

603
00:36:54.962 --> 00:36:56.630
Can you chat?

604
00:36:56.713 --> 00:36:58.632
I could really use a friend.

605
00:37:04.304 --> 00:37:05.722
Got a few minutes for you.

606
00:37:07.057 --> 00:37:08.350
Are you at work right now?

607
00:37:08.934 --> 00:37:10.227
Kind of on a field trip.

608
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.687
I kind of am too.

609
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:13.397
Certainly is a beautiful day for it.

610
00:37:14.481 --> 00:37:16.942
I guess.

611
00:37:17.526 --> 00:37:20.028
Uh-oh. Sounds like
someone's having a bad day.


612
00:37:20.612 --> 00:37:23.532
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to dump all my drama on you.


613
00:37:24.366 --> 00:37:26.868
No, no, it's what I'm here for, right?

614
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:30.831
You know what I mean.

615
00:37:31.873 --> 00:37:33.291
Right, right, of course.

616
00:37:34.584 --> 00:37:36.420
Alexa, we're leaving soon!

617
00:37:37.462 --> 00:37:39.297
Gotta go. Boss is calling.

618
00:37:39.381 --> 00:37:41.133
Talk to you later?

619
00:37:41.216 --> 00:37:42.968
I look forward to it.

620
00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:46.138
Me too.

621
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.088
Are you there?

622
00:38:26.261 --> 00:38:28.430
I'm just finishing up
a real important conference call.


623
00:38:30.432 --> 00:38:31.975
Thank you for today.

624
00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:33.477
I was having a moment.

625
00:38:34.686 --> 00:38:35.854
I know the feeling.

626
00:38:43.236 --> 00:38:46.156
Do you ever feel like the world
is conspiring against you?


627
00:38:48.575 --> 00:38:51.244
Wow. Still bothered by the breakup?

628
00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:54.039
Among other things.

629
00:38:54.122 --> 00:38:56.416
I still can't believe he
broke up with me on my birthday.


630
00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:59.586
Sounds like a real prize.

631
00:39:01.296 --> 00:39:02.464
I thought he was.

632
00:39:02.547 --> 00:39:04.466
And now for the first time my life,

633
00:39:04.549 --> 00:39:06.468
I feel like I'm not in control.

634
00:39:07.594 --> 00:39:09.012
Control of what?

635
00:39:10.138 --> 00:39:11.515
My emotions.

636
00:39:11.598 --> 00:39:13.809
I tend to go overboard
in the worry department.


637
00:39:13.892 --> 00:39:16.478
I'm sure it doesn't help
that I'm having drama at work.


638
00:39:17.479 --> 00:39:18.605
Oh, yeah.

639
00:39:18.688 --> 00:39:20.148
Must be going around.

640
00:39:20.232 --> 00:39:22.859
You know, if you ask me,

641
00:39:22.943 --> 00:39:26.154
thinking you can be
in complete control of anything,


642
00:39:26.238 --> 00:39:28.115
it's just a pipedream.

643
00:39:28.198 --> 00:39:31.243
As John Lennon would say,
"Life is what happens to you


644
00:39:31.326 --> 00:39:33.870
while you're busy making other plans."

645
00:39:35.664 --> 00:39:37.165
That was Allen Saunders.

646
00:39:39.167 --> 00:39:40.710
No, that was definitely John Lennon.

647
00:39:41.795 --> 00:39:43.797
Who took it from Allen Saunders.

648
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.634
For real?

649
00:39:49.219 --> 00:39:50.303
For real.

650
00:39:52.013 --> 00:39:55.058
So, if you were
me, what would you do?

651
00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:57.978
Do what I always
do: go along with it.

652
00:39:58.728 --> 00:40:00.689
Try to make the most of it.

653
00:40:00.772 --> 00:40:05.485
And most importantly, don't concern
yourself with the wrong things.


654
00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:13.076
Is that how you're getting over your ex?

655
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.622
Trying to, thanks to you.

656
00:40:22.335 --> 00:40:24.129
Talk to you tomorrow, Him?

657
00:40:24.713 --> 00:40:26.214
Talk to you tomorrow, Her.

658
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.004
What do you think?

659
00:41:11.968 --> 00:41:13.011
I'm torn.

660
00:41:15.597 --> 00:41:16.723
Because of your ex?

661
00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:21.728
What if we met, and we ruin this?

662
00:41:23.104 --> 00:41:25.732
What if it's perfect the way it is?

663
00:41:27.984 --> 00:41:29.986
I really like what we have.

664
00:41:30.987 --> 00:41:33.240
I'm afraid if we met, we'd lose it.

665
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.701
You're probably right.

666
00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:38.745
I'm really glad I met you.

667
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.917
Me too.

668
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.293
Good night.

669
00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:48.171
Good night.

670
00:42:12.654 --> 00:42:14.572
You busted out the John Lennon?

671
00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:17.158
Allen Saunders, apparently.

672
00:42:18.243 --> 00:42:20.412
I don't know, man,
I think I'm with her on this one.


673
00:42:23.123 --> 00:42:25.542
Oh, come on!

674
00:42:25.625 --> 00:42:27.252
I think you're making a mistake.

675
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.758
Remember that woman I met
online, before Julia?


676
00:42:33.842 --> 00:42:34.843
The nurse?

677
00:42:34.926 --> 00:42:36.928
No, no, the paralegal.

678
00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:40.890
My point is that everything
was going great, right?


679
00:42:40.974 --> 00:42:42.475
We were talking all the time,

680
00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:44.436
we were texting back and forth
every night,


681
00:42:44.519 --> 00:42:46.146
then when we finally met in person...

682
00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:48.857
it all fell apart.

683
00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.483
Because she had a mustache.

684
00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:53.445
No. It's because
we didn't click, all right?


685
00:42:53.528 --> 00:42:54.529
So?

686
00:43:01.703 --> 00:43:03.621
I mean, wouldn't you just, like,
rather rip the Band-Aid off


687
00:43:03.705 --> 00:43:05.123
and get it over with anyway?

688
00:43:05.206 --> 00:43:07.250
It's a big enough distraction as it is.

689
00:43:07.334 --> 00:43:09.085
Maybe that's a good thing.

690
00:43:09.169 --> 00:43:12.672
I mean, with all my mom's bills,

691
00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:15.842
now I have to cover the entire
rent without... you know.


692
00:43:15.925 --> 00:43:17.177
Julia.

693
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.345
I need that promotion.

694
00:43:18.428 --> 00:43:20.597
That's what I have to focus on.

695
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.349
Not Her.

696
00:43:23.808 --> 00:43:25.977
And you're right.
Alexa's tougher than I thought.


697
00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:28.938
Not to mention,
wine isn't exactly my forte.


698
00:43:31.316 --> 00:43:34.736
Look, you're the best salesman I know.

699
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:40.116
I'd bet you could sell a hamburger
to a vegan if you really wanted to do it.


700
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.786
Well, at least I can describe a hamburger.

701
00:43:42.869 --> 00:43:45.663
Oh, great. Then you can buy me one.

702
00:43:45.747 --> 00:43:47.582
Funny.

703
00:43:47.665 --> 00:43:49.084
Seriously, though...

704
00:43:50.168 --> 00:43:52.003
I think you got something good going.

705
00:43:53.088 --> 00:43:55.882
And if you play your cards right,

706
00:43:55.965 --> 00:43:59.052
I think you could get the job
and the girl.


707
00:44:00.553 --> 00:44:02.389
-My cards, huh?
-Yeah.


708
00:44:02.472 --> 00:44:04.516
Yeah? Step aside.

709
00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:06.643
Let me show you bowling, all right?

710
00:44:06.726 --> 00:44:08.269
All right.

711
00:45:33.855 --> 00:45:36.107
I'm fine, Mom, I promise.

712
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:40.028
Of course I miss Julia. It just...

713
00:45:40.111 --> 00:45:42.322
It wasn't right, that's all.

714
00:45:43.156 --> 00:45:45.408
I know, I know. 
I'm working on it.

715
00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:48.745
How many times do
I have to tell you?

716
00:45:48.828 --> 00:45:50.330
I don't want you worrying
about that stuff.


717
00:45:50.413 --> 00:45:51.789
Just send me the bill.

718
00:45:53.833 --> 00:45:56.002
Yes, I'm keeping track of every penny.

719
00:45:58.713 --> 00:46:00.423
You're welcome.

720
00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:02.008
I love you too.

721
00:46:05.094 --> 00:46:06.554
I'll call you later.

722
00:46:08.723 --> 00:46:10.099
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey.


723
00:46:10.183 --> 00:46:12.894
Just wondering if you heard from Debra
about the date of the pitch.


724
00:46:12.977 --> 00:46:14.312
No, I haven't. Soon, though.

725
00:46:14.395 --> 00:46:15.522
Hmm.

726
00:46:18.399 --> 00:46:20.235
Is everything okay?

727
00:46:20.318 --> 00:46:22.195
Yeah, yeah.

728
00:46:22.278 --> 00:46:24.531
Yeah, I mean, I'm just sitting here,

729
00:46:24.614 --> 00:46:26.908
wondering what I'm gonna do
with the extra income


730
00:46:26.991 --> 00:46:28.409
when I bring in Craig's winery.

731
00:46:28.493 --> 00:46:31.246
There goes that common ground again.

732
00:46:31.329 --> 00:46:32.664
Yep.

733
00:46:42.507 --> 00:46:44.133
So, you think that's Him?

734
00:46:45.927 --> 00:46:47.554
Hannah.

735
00:46:47.637 --> 00:46:49.722
How about Johnny Smiles over there?

736
00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:52.517
Okay, stop.
It could literally be anyone.


737
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.810
Think about it.

738
00:46:54.602 --> 00:46:58.147
The girl of your dreams
could be sitting at that table,


739
00:46:58.231 --> 00:47:00.441
and you would never even know about it.

740
00:47:00.525 --> 00:47:03.236
Where is your sense of mystery
and romance, huh?


741
00:47:03.319 --> 00:47:05.238
And the two of you
are really not gonna meet?


742
00:47:05.321 --> 00:47:07.865
-That is so sad.
-We've decided not to ruin it.


743
00:47:07.949 --> 00:47:09.826
What if I've been prioritizing

744
00:47:09.909 --> 00:47:12.078
all the wrong things these years, huh?

745
00:47:12.161 --> 00:47:15.623
What if I'm finally realizing
it's about what's on the inside?


746
00:47:15.707 --> 00:47:18.543
And what if on the outside,
it's some 18-year-old kid


747
00:47:18.626 --> 00:47:21.879
messing with you from
his grandma's basement, huh?


748
00:47:21.963 --> 00:47:24.549
I'm being serious, all right?

749
00:47:24.632 --> 00:47:27.719
Why risk losing a connection
that we already have?


750
00:47:27.802 --> 00:47:29.554
By not being in the same room.

751
00:47:29.637 --> 00:47:30.972
Okay, enough about me.

752
00:47:31.055 --> 00:47:34.142
Are any of these
guys doing it for you?

753
00:47:34.225 --> 00:47:36.603
These guys? Nah.

754
00:47:36.686 --> 00:47:38.563
I am happily single.

755
00:47:38.646 --> 00:47:40.565
Because you don't talk
to the girl you like.


756
00:47:40.648 --> 00:47:42.525
Oh, wow.

757
00:47:42.609 --> 00:47:47.280
So, what happened to the sense
of mystery and romance now?


758
00:47:47.363 --> 00:47:49.782
Wait, so there is someone.

759
00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.327
Maybe.

760
00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.996
Wait, do I know him?
Not Dave from accounting.


761
00:47:55.079 --> 00:47:56.831
It's not like you
don't see her every day.

762
00:47:56.914 --> 00:48:00.543
Well, if you must know,
we talked this morning.


763
00:48:00.627 --> 00:48:03.004
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.


764
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.382
She said good morning to me.

765
00:48:06.466 --> 00:48:08.635
Oh, yeah? And?

766
00:48:09.969 --> 00:48:12.305
And I said good morning back to her.

767
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.812
What? I feel like there was some
unspoken communication going on there.


768
00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:21.981
What are you waiting for, man?

769
00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:23.858
Why don't you just go up to her
and, you know,


770
00:48:23.941 --> 00:48:26.903
ask her if she wants to get
some coffee or something?


771
00:48:26.986 --> 00:48:29.364
She probably doesn't even know
that I exist.


772
00:48:29.447 --> 00:48:30.740
What do you think of Brad?

773
00:48:30.823 --> 00:48:32.867
What?

774
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.369
You don't think he's cute?

775
00:48:34.452 --> 00:48:35.870
No, it's not that.

776
00:48:35.953 --> 00:48:37.622
So, what's the problem, then?

777
00:48:37.705 --> 00:48:40.792
No, it's just, you know,
he's friends with... him.


778
00:48:40.875 --> 00:48:42.669
He'd probably say
the same thing about us.


779
00:48:42.752 --> 00:48:44.545
True.

780
00:48:44.629 --> 00:48:46.381
Does it not bother you

781
00:48:46.464 --> 00:48:50.426
that she's, like, best friends
with your archenemy?


782
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.053
Archenemy?

783
00:48:52.136 --> 00:48:54.138
That's a little harsh, don't you think?

784
00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:58.309
You know, I think Jason's not such
a bad guy once you get to know him.


785
00:48:58.393 --> 00:49:00.728
Well, that would require me
getting to know him.


786
00:49:00.812 --> 00:49:03.648
Wouldn't it be better if you two
could figure out a way


787
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:06.818
to, you know, actually work together?

788
00:49:07.402 --> 00:49:09.362
Do you think would be better
if you actually tell Hannah


789
00:49:09.445 --> 00:49:10.863
how you feel about her?

790
00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:14.242
So... about Brad...

791
00:49:14.325 --> 00:49:16.327
Why not? If it makes you happy.

792
00:49:16.411 --> 00:49:18.663
Glass houses, my friend.

793
00:49:18.746 --> 00:49:22.291
Yeah, glass houses.

794
00:49:22.375 --> 00:49:26.212
Now we have to find someone who
makes you happy... in person.


795
00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.404
This is good, right?

796
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.158
See you soon.

797
00:49:56.659 --> 00:49:58.077
Don't blow it.

798
00:50:07.712 --> 00:50:10.757
-Oh, no, no, no, I'm good.
-Yes, yes, yes.


799
00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.760
This is one of the first bottles
my father ever produced.


800
00:50:13.843 --> 00:50:16.012
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.


801
00:50:16.095 --> 00:50:18.306
This is quite a remarkable story.

802
00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:22.143
He started all of this with a few vines
in his humble backyard.


803
00:50:22.226 --> 00:50:23.227
Wow.

804
00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:28.608
I like to think there's a bit of his
spirit in every bottle of Goodwin wine.


805
00:50:28.691 --> 00:50:29.859
To your father.

806
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.236
B.J. Goodwin.

807
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:35.072
Mmm.

808
00:50:36.616 --> 00:50:38.618
He liked to quote President Lincoln.

809
00:50:38.701 --> 00:50:40.411
"If given the truth,

810
00:50:40.495 --> 00:50:44.707
the people can be depended upon
to meet any national crisis.


811
00:50:44.791 --> 00:50:48.669
The great point is to bring them
the real facts


812
00:50:48.753 --> 00:50:50.671
and... wine."

813
00:50:53.257 --> 00:50:56.219
Is that what this is?
Some kind of test?


814
00:50:57.345 --> 00:50:59.555
My dad also told me,

815
00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:03.226
"A good boss should get to know
the folks he's working with."


816
00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:06.813
Or in this case,
may very well work with.


817
00:51:06.896 --> 00:51:09.148
So, how do I convince you
I'm the right woman for the job?


818
00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.067
I didn't bring you here to pitch me.

819
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:14.111
-No?
-Tell me about yourself.


820
00:51:14.195 --> 00:51:18.199
Well, I believe a good campaign
should be about


821
00:51:18.282 --> 00:51:20.201
connecting with the consumer
on an emotional level.


822
00:51:20.284 --> 00:51:21.994
Not your business strategy.

823
00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:24.664
You, the Alexa Parker story.

824
00:51:24.747 --> 00:51:29.043
Oh, okay, well, 
I was born in San Pedro.

825
00:51:29.126 --> 00:51:30.795
I went to college in San Francisco.

826
00:51:30.878 --> 00:51:32.630
-Mm-hmm.
-And before he passed,


827
00:51:32.713 --> 00:51:34.882
my father spent his whole life
in advertising,


828
00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:37.385
and all I've ever wanted to do
was follow in his footsteps.


829
00:51:38.219 --> 00:51:39.220
Or be an astronaut.

830
00:51:39.303 --> 00:51:41.639
But I was lousy in science, so...

831
00:51:41.722 --> 00:51:43.558
Me too.

832
00:51:43.641 --> 00:51:46.018
You see? We're getting
to know each other.


833
00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:49.605
If I get this promotion,
it'll feel like I finally made it.


834
00:51:49.689 --> 00:51:51.566
You know, proven to him
that I can do it.


835
00:51:51.649 --> 00:51:54.735
I'm sure he already knows.

836
00:51:54.819 --> 00:51:57.321
And you'll most certainly get your chance.

837
00:51:57.405 --> 00:51:59.115
Both of you.

838
00:51:59.198 --> 00:52:00.783
Hmm?

839
00:52:00.867 --> 00:52:02.326
Didn't realize it was a party.

840
00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:03.786
Wait, what are you doing here?

841
00:52:04.745 --> 00:52:06.080
I invited him.

842
00:52:06.163 --> 00:52:08.332
-Wait, what?
-You're getting your turn,


843
00:52:08.416 --> 00:52:10.376
and I'm sure you'd certainly
want him to get his.


844
00:52:10.459 --> 00:52:12.962
After all, there's no reason
why this shouldn't be


845
00:52:13.045 --> 00:52:15.089
a fair contest, right?

846
00:52:15.172 --> 00:52:16.173
Right.

847
00:52:17.383 --> 00:52:19.260
Wait, you don't have to go.
He's early.


848
00:52:19.343 --> 00:52:21.762
Oh, no, no, no. I have a lot of work
to do in the morning,


849
00:52:21.846 --> 00:52:23.890
so I'll just leave you two to it.

850
00:52:23.973 --> 00:52:25.266
Thank you for the wine.

851
00:52:26.267 --> 00:52:28.185
I look forward to your pitch.

852
00:52:29.729 --> 00:52:30.771
Excuse me a minute?

853
00:52:30.855 --> 00:52:32.732
-Yeah.
-Okay.


854
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:35.985
Hey.

855
00:52:36.068 --> 00:52:38.279
Don't you two have
some guy talk to get to?


856
00:52:38.362 --> 00:52:40.907
I didn't know he had us stacked
like this tonight, okay?


857
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.408
This is awkward for me too.

858
00:52:42.491 --> 00:52:44.410
Okay, so what is this, like a truce?

859
00:52:44.493 --> 00:52:47.288
We're under enough pressure
as it is, don't you think?


860
00:52:47.371 --> 00:52:49.707
I overheard you talking
to your mom today.


861
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:52.376
Oh, yeah, don't worry about it.

862
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.253
Well, it sounds like she really needs you.

863
00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:56.422
You bought a house, right?

864
00:52:56.505 --> 00:53:00.468
Between the mortgage and taxes,
it's gonna cost a fortune.


865
00:53:00.551 --> 00:53:02.428
-Am I right?
-Yeah.


866
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:04.430
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, Parker.


867
00:53:04.513 --> 00:53:07.475
There's no reason to make this
any worse than it has to be.


868
00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:10.603
What has gotten into you?

869
00:53:13.147 --> 00:53:14.607
I don't know. Just...

870
00:53:15.691 --> 00:53:17.777
I guess I'm feeling more human lately.

871
00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:20.613
Yeah, well, better late
than never, I guess.


872
00:53:26.661 --> 00:53:29.455
My ride's almost here.

873
00:53:29.538 --> 00:53:32.583
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Get home safe.


874
00:53:33.918 --> 00:53:35.211
Thanks, Crawford.

875
00:53:50.935 --> 00:53:52.436
What?

876
00:53:56.941 --> 00:53:59.860
Hey, I wasn't sure you'd still be up.

877
00:53:59.944 --> 00:54:02.113
Actually, I just got out of a meeting.

878
00:54:02.196 --> 00:54:04.865
Now? It's kinda late, isn't it?

879
00:54:04.949 --> 00:54:08.035
I don't know. Why don't you ask
your life coach what she thinks?


880
00:54:08.119 --> 00:54:10.413
Yeah, about that...

881
00:54:11.497 --> 00:54:13.249
I miss you, Alex.

882
00:54:13.332 --> 00:54:15.126
I'm sorry?

883
00:54:15.209 --> 00:54:18.879
I was hoping that we could
maybe have lunch tomorrow?


884
00:54:18.963 --> 00:54:19.964
My treat.

885
00:54:20.047 --> 00:54:22.008
What, haven't you broken my heart
enough already?


886
00:54:22.091 --> 00:54:24.176
Baby, just give me a chance to explain.

887
00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.220
One lunch. That's all I ask.

888
00:54:27.304 --> 00:54:28.889
I'll text you in the morning.

889
00:54:28.973 --> 00:54:30.224
Is that a yes?

890
00:54:30.307 --> 00:54:31.976
It's an "I'll text you in the morning."

891
00:54:32.059 --> 00:54:33.978
Okay, I'll talk to you when you--

892
00:54:45.948 --> 00:54:48.034
-What do you think?
-Hmm.


893
00:54:48.117 --> 00:54:51.704
A lot of the wineries up here
branching out into microbreweries now.


894
00:54:51.787 --> 00:54:53.539
Yeah? Yeah, I think it could work.

895
00:54:53.622 --> 00:54:55.791
Would expand your male clientele too.

896
00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:56.792
Mm-hmm.

897
00:54:56.876 --> 00:54:58.002
My father?

898
00:54:58.085 --> 00:54:59.795
Dead set against the idea.

899
00:54:59.879 --> 00:55:02.423
Yeah, my dad was conservative too.

900
00:55:04.008 --> 00:55:07.553
I'm actually kind of surprised
he trusted me to run the place.


901
00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:14.060
My dad always told me I'd be a salesman
or a talk show host.


902
00:55:15.436 --> 00:55:17.438
He may have been on to something.

903
00:55:17.521 --> 00:55:21.150
Oh, man, they sure do have
a way about 'em, don't they?


904
00:55:21.233 --> 00:55:24.445
That's right.
You know, for what it's worth,


905
00:55:24.528 --> 00:55:27.865
I think you've really done
a great job with this place.


906
00:55:27.948 --> 00:55:31.827
It's a shame that he's not here
to watch you


907
00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:34.997
take what he's created
and really push it into the future.


908
00:55:35.831 --> 00:55:37.083
Yeah.

909
00:55:37.166 --> 00:55:39.585
Hey, to our dads.

910
00:55:39.668 --> 00:55:41.087
To our dads.

911
00:55:45.758 --> 00:55:48.260
So, you and Alexa...

912
00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:50.638
Alexa and you.

913
00:55:51.889 --> 00:55:54.391
No, no.

914
00:55:54.475 --> 00:55:58.312
Really? I thought I saw you guys
have quite a moment over there.


915
00:55:58.395 --> 00:56:01.107
Her and I? No. 
Oil and water.

916
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:02.483
Don't forget.

917
00:56:02.566 --> 00:56:06.403
That combination...
can start quite a fire.


918
00:56:08.489 --> 00:56:09.573
Excuse me.

919
00:56:11.117 --> 00:56:12.409
Are you there?

920
00:56:12.493 --> 00:56:14.829
I really need to talk.

921
00:56:18.207 --> 00:56:19.583
Everything all right?

922
00:56:19.667 --> 00:56:20.668
Um...

923
00:56:21.669 --> 00:56:24.338
I'm not keeping you
from anything important, am I?


924
00:56:25.965 --> 00:56:27.383
I don't know.

925
00:56:27.466 --> 00:56:29.927
I think a friend of mine
might be in trouble.


926
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:32.888
Oh, well...

927
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:37.726
there are worse things to be in
this world than a good friend.


928
00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:39.728
You better get out of here.

929
00:56:39.812 --> 00:56:42.231
-You sure?
-Yeah, go on. Scram.


930
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:44.608
Okay.

931
00:56:44.692 --> 00:56:46.777
-Thanks for understanding.
-Yeah.


932
00:56:59.874 --> 00:57:01.750
It's me. Are you okay?

933
00:57:03.544 --> 00:57:05.462
I was leaving this work-drinks thing,

934
00:57:05.546 --> 00:57:07.548
and Perry FaceTimed me.

935
00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.803
You're kidding. You okay?

936
00:57:15.306 --> 00:57:17.099
I was pretty rocked at first,

937
00:57:17.183 --> 00:57:19.894
but then I remembered
I can't control everything.


938
00:57:19.977 --> 00:57:22.521
Am I worrying about
the wrong things again?


939
00:57:25.816 --> 00:57:27.026
Do not be in a hurry.

940
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.904
The right man will come at last.

941
00:57:29.987 --> 00:57:32.656
Okay, Jane Austen.

942
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.992
But how can you be so sure?

943
00:57:35.075 --> 00:57:38.454
You only know me from this,
whatever this is.


944
00:57:39.288 --> 00:57:40.456
Because I can tell.

945
00:57:41.749 --> 00:57:45.002
I'd be shocked if someone
didn't see that soon enough


946
00:57:45.085 --> 00:57:47.087
and treat you the way you deserve.

947
00:57:49.924 --> 00:57:52.426
Please tell me I didn't drag you
away from anything important.


948
00:57:52.509 --> 00:57:54.929
I was actually at a work-drinks thing too.

949
00:57:56.847 --> 00:57:58.682
Don't worry about it.

950
00:57:58.766 --> 00:58:00.309
This was more important.

951
00:58:03.145 --> 00:58:05.981
You're sweet,
and you're a really good friend.


952
00:58:07.399 --> 00:58:09.860
Sweet dreams, Her.

953
00:58:10.611 --> 00:58:13.030
Sweet dreams, Him.

954
00:58:22.581 --> 00:58:25.084
-Let me give you my number.
-All right.


955
00:58:25.167 --> 00:58:26.335
Okay.

956
00:58:28.545 --> 00:58:30.172
Ohh...

957
00:58:30.256 --> 00:58:32.007
I'd better go see what's going on.

958
00:58:32.091 --> 00:58:33.717
Okay, no worries. See ya.

959
00:58:33.801 --> 00:58:35.094
-Bye.
-See ya.


960
00:58:48.399 --> 00:58:49.650
What did you do?

961
00:58:49.733 --> 00:58:51.485
I told him I'd get back to him.

962
00:58:51.568 --> 00:58:53.612
-And then?
-I hung up.


963
00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:54.863
You should've called me.

964
00:58:54.947 --> 00:58:56.615
I know. I thought about it, but...

965
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:59.451
You texted Him.

966
00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:02.538
I couldn't help it.
It was like a reflex.


967
00:59:02.621 --> 00:59:05.416
And you used to hate technology.

968
00:59:05.499 --> 00:59:08.961
I don't know. He's just--
He's just a good person.


969
00:59:09.044 --> 00:59:11.755
You know, and he makes me laugh,
and he's such a good listener.


970
00:59:11.839 --> 00:59:13.173
I mean, not that you aren't.

971
00:59:15.384 --> 00:59:17.219
He's my breakup whisperer.

972
00:59:18.053 --> 00:59:19.680
So, meet Him already.

973
00:59:19.763 --> 00:59:22.266
Hannah, seriously,
I've never been friends with a guy


974
00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:24.018
where there's just no pressure.

975
00:59:24.101 --> 00:59:26.437
It's just natural with Him.

976
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.397
Honest. Fun.

977
00:59:28.981 --> 00:59:30.482
If you say so.

978
00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:33.277
But speaking of pressure...

979
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.738
Perry. I know.

980
00:59:37.197 --> 00:59:40.242
I mean, he did sound pretty sincere.

981
00:59:40.326 --> 00:59:42.202
And it's just lunch, right?

982
00:59:42.286 --> 00:59:43.704
You tell me.

983
00:59:59.845 --> 01:00:01.013
You made it.

984
01:00:01.096 --> 01:00:02.264
I made it.

985
01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:07.519
Never thought I'd come back here.

986
01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.105
Um, I took the liberty.

987
01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:11.899
I know you prefer red.

988
01:00:13.525 --> 01:00:15.194
Sporty spice.

989
01:00:15.277 --> 01:00:16.445
What's that?

990
01:00:17.279 --> 01:00:18.280
Uh, nothing.

991
01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:21.784
How's work?

992
01:00:21.867 --> 01:00:23.410
It's good.

993
01:00:23.494 --> 01:00:24.995
Still working on that promotion?

994
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.040
Look, you didn't ask me here
to talk about my job.


995
01:00:28.123 --> 01:00:29.500
Look, what's going on?

996
01:00:30.959 --> 01:00:33.379
I owe you a big apology, Alex.

997
01:00:33.462 --> 01:00:34.963
I was stupid.

998
01:00:35.047 --> 01:00:38.092
I was impulsive. I was wrong.

999
01:00:38.175 --> 01:00:40.886
Is this some kind of self-help exercise?

1000
01:00:40.969 --> 01:00:42.888
Your life coach put
you up to this too?

1001
01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:44.223
I was scared, Alex.

1002
01:00:44.306 --> 01:00:47.434
We had been together for 10 months.
We were practically living together.


1003
01:00:47.518 --> 01:00:49.520
I knew what the next step
was supposed to be.


1004
01:00:50.729 --> 01:00:53.232
But instead of making
that commitment, I ran.


1005
01:00:53.315 --> 01:00:54.942
Yeah.

1006
01:00:55.025 --> 01:00:57.236
The truth is you're smart...

1007
01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.738
you are beautiful...

1008
01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:04.868
and yeah, sometimes
I get intimidated by you,


1009
01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:06.620
but that's okay.

1010
01:01:06.703 --> 01:01:08.497
I just--

1011
01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.792
I don't want a future
that doesn't have you in it.


1012
01:01:26.056 --> 01:01:27.057
Guess what.

1013
01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.643
Hey.

1014
01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:36.733
Perry asked me to take him back.

1015
01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:42.239
He said he was sorry,
that he really sees a future with me.


1016
01:01:45.909 --> 01:01:47.369
Wow.

1017
01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.872
That's really something.

1018
01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:57.713
He asked me to
go out with him tonight.

1019
01:02:04.261 --> 01:02:06.889
Good for you. Really happy for you.

1020
01:02:09.057 --> 01:02:10.684
Are you sure?

1021
01:02:10.767 --> 01:02:12.978
You don't think it's a mistake, do you?

1022
01:02:17.107 --> 01:02:19.485
No, really, it's great.

1023
01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:21.653
You deserve this.

1024
01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:24.364
Thanks for the update.

1025
01:02:27.951 --> 01:02:30.329
Wait, are you mad?

1026
01:02:36.126 --> 01:02:37.127
No, not at all.

1027
01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:40.839
But I should get back to work now.

1028
01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:54.228
Ooh.

1029
01:02:57.147 --> 01:02:58.941
Here. Good as new.

1030
01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:02.319
Can't believe I accidentally
dropped it like that.


1031
01:03:02.402 --> 01:03:06.823
Well, as my two-minute yoga app says,
"Everything happens for a reason."


1032
01:03:07.908 --> 01:03:09.493
If you say so, Trey.

1033
01:03:09.576 --> 01:03:12.162
Um, hey, be glad it wasn't broken, though,

1034
01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:14.623
because I gave my last new phone
to Alexa last week.


1035
01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:17.793
-Oh.
-Yeah.


1036
01:03:17.876 --> 01:03:19.670
-Alexa got a new phone?
-Oh, yeah.


1037
01:03:19.753 --> 01:03:23.340
Said she dropped her other one
in a bucket of water or something.


1038
01:03:24.424 --> 01:03:28.262
Anyway, if you think you're gonna
drop it again, I have got some cases.


1039
01:03:28.845 --> 01:03:31.098
Oh, I'm good. Thanks though.

1040
01:03:37.354 --> 01:03:42.234
Curious. How are the numbers
assigned on these?


1041
01:03:42.317 --> 01:03:44.361
Company's got
a whole block of numbers.


1042
01:03:44.444 --> 01:03:46.446
They're all sequential. Why?

1043
01:03:54.246 --> 01:03:55.247
You talk to Hannah?

1044
01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:58.625
Mm-hmm. Guess who's going
hiking with her this weekend?


1045
01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:00.919
-Hoo-hoo!
-Can I have her phone number?


1046
01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:03.338
No. Slow down. 
I asked her first.

1047
01:04:03.422 --> 01:04:05.882
Please. I need the number.

1048
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.428
All right.

1049
01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:10.804
It's, uh...

1050
01:04:10.887 --> 01:04:15.267
555-0128.

1051
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:20.564
5-0-1-8-2.

1052
01:04:20.647 --> 01:04:22.107
Yeah, so?

1053
01:04:24.192 --> 01:04:26.111
Two digits backwards.

1054
01:04:26.194 --> 01:04:27.779
I got the last two digits

1055
01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:29.990
of my best friend's
phone number backwards.


1056
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.827
Are you good, man?

1057
01:04:36.663 --> 01:04:37.748
Oh, boy.

1058
01:04:38.832 --> 01:04:39.833
Jason?

1059
01:04:42.544 --> 01:04:44.713
I still can't believe he broke
up with me on my birthday.


1060
01:04:44.796 --> 01:04:46.214
Oh, it's your birthday?

1061
01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:54.890
I was leaving this work-drinks thing,
and Perry FaceTimed me.


1062
01:04:54.973 --> 01:04:57.476
I was actually at a work-drinks thing too.

1063
01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:00.145
Alexa.

1064
01:05:02.606 --> 01:05:03.607
It's her.

1065
01:05:22.876 --> 01:05:25.128
-Hey, hot shot!
-Yeah.


1066
01:05:25.212 --> 01:05:27.214
Can you come here
for a second, please?


1067
01:05:29.466 --> 01:05:31.635
I just wanted to make sure that
you were ready for tomorrow.


1068
01:05:32.302 --> 01:05:33.303
What?

1069
01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:36.473
Really? For the pitch.

1070
01:05:36.556 --> 01:05:38.266
The winery, the promotion.

1071
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:40.769
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm ready.
Got it right here.


1072
01:05:40.852 --> 01:05:42.604
Are you sure?
'Cause you seem a little--


1073
01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:44.439
Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Everything's here.


1074
01:05:44.523 --> 01:05:46.400
I'm ready, prepared, ready to go.

1075
01:05:46.483 --> 01:05:49.236
I couldn't help but notice that
it's a little quiet around here.


1076
01:05:49.319 --> 01:05:51.571
I thought there might have been
a little bit of fireworks


1077
01:05:51.655 --> 01:05:53.615
between you and Alexa
before the big event.


1078
01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:57.119
Yeah, I guess you could say
that we've just been, um...


1079
01:05:57.202 --> 01:05:59.121
dealing with each other
a little differently lately.


1080
01:05:59.204 --> 01:06:01.873
Well, as long as one of you
gets that contract.


1081
01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:03.208
Yeah.

1082
01:06:03.291 --> 01:06:05.961
Then you guys can deal with each other
however you want.


1083
01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:09.131
Yeah.

1084
01:06:09.214 --> 01:06:12.259
All right, good.
Well, I will see you tomorrow.


1085
01:06:12.342 --> 01:06:14.886
Yeah. Have a good night.

1086
01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.430
Get some rest.

1087
01:06:16.513 --> 01:06:17.556
I will.

1088
01:06:21.101 --> 01:06:23.687
This place is really nice.
I didn't even know it was here.


1089
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.272
It's actually a family business.

1090
01:06:25.355 --> 01:06:26.732
Would you believe the father
started in the backyard


1091
01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:28.108
with just a few vines?

1092
01:06:28.191 --> 01:06:29.651
-Wow.
-Yeah.


1093
01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:31.737
You know a lot about this place.
Are they clients?


1094
01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:32.946
Hopefully.

1095
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:34.698
Just can't stay away, huh?

1096
01:06:34.781 --> 01:06:36.950
You're here!

1097
01:06:37.033 --> 01:06:38.827
Perry, I want you to meet
Craig, the owner.


1098
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:40.495
His father is the one
who started the place.


1099
01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:42.289
-Good to meet you.
-Likewise.


1100
01:06:42.372 --> 01:06:44.416
I was just telling Alexa what
an amazing place you have here.


1101
01:06:44.499 --> 01:06:46.793
Well, thank you. It's home.

1102
01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:51.506
If you ever need help managing
your financial portfolio...


1103
01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:55.343
Well, that's good to know.

1104
01:06:55.427 --> 01:06:57.679
-Please.
-Yeah.


1105
01:06:57.763 --> 01:07:00.682
Alexa, how are you feeling
about tomorrow?


1106
01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:03.185
I feel good. I feel like
I've got some real solid ideas


1107
01:07:03.268 --> 01:07:05.187
on how we can extend
your father's legacy.


1108
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.105
Excellent.

1109
01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:10.984
I must say, you and your colleague Jason
are an intriguing pair.


1110
01:07:11.067 --> 01:07:12.861
You seem to really spark
off of each other.


1111
01:07:12.944 --> 01:07:15.530
Nobody works harder than this
lady, I can promise you that.


1112
01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:18.992
No doubt. Now, listen,
don't let me interrupt your evening.


1113
01:07:19.075 --> 01:07:21.453
But remember,
mi casa es su casa.


1114
01:07:21.536 --> 01:07:22.996
Aw, thank you.

1115
01:07:23.872 --> 01:07:25.081
It was nice meeting you.

1116
01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:36.218
Thanks for tonight.

1117
01:07:36.301 --> 01:07:39.012
Normally I'd be pacing my
living room before a big pitch,


1118
01:07:39.095 --> 01:07:41.014
especially with the stakes
dangling over this one.


1119
01:07:41.097 --> 01:07:42.516
I feel like I should be thanking you.

1120
01:07:42.599 --> 01:07:44.518
-For what?
-For giving me a second chance.


1121
01:07:44.601 --> 01:07:46.478
Look...

1122
01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:47.979
-I've been thinking.
-Perry...


1123
01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:49.356
I think we should get a place together.

1124
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:51.233
What?

1125
01:07:51.316 --> 01:07:54.361
I'm at your place all the time as it is,
or at least I was.


1126
01:07:54.444 --> 01:07:56.112
Yeah, but I just bought the house.

1127
01:07:56.196 --> 01:07:58.073
-I've just gotten settled.
-Great.


1128
01:07:58.156 --> 01:08:00.408
So, we can live there.
I'll even help with the mortgage.


1129
01:08:00.492 --> 01:08:02.410
What happened to
not talking about the future?


1130
01:08:02.494 --> 01:08:04.371
I'm done running away
from commitment.


1131
01:08:04.454 --> 01:08:06.456
Life is what happens

1132
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.375
when you're busy making other plans.

1133
01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:09.668
What's that?

1134
01:08:11.127 --> 01:08:15.048
Nothing. Just something
a friend of mine said.


1135
01:08:15.131 --> 01:08:18.343
Alexa Parker, are you learning
to live in the moment?


1136
01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.345
Maybe I'm just trying
to make the best of it.


1137
01:08:20.428 --> 01:08:23.265
You don't have to decide tonight, but...

1138
01:08:23.348 --> 01:08:24.891
I don't want to lose you again.

1139
01:09:20.989 --> 01:09:21.990
Hey.

1140
01:09:27.996 --> 01:09:29.497
So, how did your date go?

1141
01:09:31.541 --> 01:09:34.336
He wants us to move in together.

1142
01:09:37.088 --> 01:09:39.799
Wow. That was fast.

1143
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:44.429
Funny thing is, two weeks ago,

1144
01:09:44.512 --> 01:09:46.348
I would've killed
for this kind of commitment.


1145
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:47.849
But not now?

1146
01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:52.812
I mean, I should be happy, right?

1147
01:09:55.857 --> 01:09:56.900
Yeah.

1148
01:10:00.528 --> 01:10:01.655
Something wrong?

1149
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.659
Just a little surprised, that's all.

1150
01:10:07.744 --> 01:10:08.870
Why?

1151
01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:10.830
Because of the way he treated you.

1152
01:10:12.582 --> 01:10:14.167
What do you mean?

1153
01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:18.338
My heart feels like
it's been torn out of my chest,


1154
01:10:18.421 --> 01:10:21.383
thrown on the floor and stomped on.

1155
01:10:21.466 --> 01:10:23.093
Ring any bells?

1156
01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.304
You're the one who said
someone would come along


1157
01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:27.472
and treat me right.

1158
01:10:28.056 --> 01:10:30.266
I know, but this guy?

1159
01:10:31.935 --> 01:10:33.853
Wait, don't you want me to be happy?

1160
01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:37.899
Very much.

1161
01:10:41.027 --> 01:10:44.531
I think there's something real here,

1162
01:10:44.614 --> 01:10:46.116
between you and me.

1163
01:10:53.498 --> 01:10:55.083
What if it's too late?

1164
01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.757
I think we should meet.

1165
01:11:09.931 --> 01:11:11.933
I need to think about this.

1166
01:11:18.231 --> 01:11:19.232
Good night.

1167
01:11:21.484 --> 01:11:22.736
Good night, Parker.

1168
01:12:09.824 --> 01:12:13.161
Goodwin Wines isn't just about wine.

1169
01:12:13.244 --> 01:12:17.707
Goodwin Wines is about
more than just wine.


1170
01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.919
Okay, I want to talk about family.

1171
01:12:21.002 --> 01:12:22.545
No, no. Um...

1172
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:24.631
Let's talk about family.

1173
01:12:26.841 --> 01:12:30.470
Classic wine doesn't mean
you can't have new customers.


1174
01:12:31.554 --> 01:12:35.183
Classic wine doesn't mean
you can't have new customers.


1175
01:12:36.768 --> 01:12:38.061
Classic wine...

1176
01:12:40.105 --> 01:12:41.815
doesn't mean you can't have new customers.

1177
01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:01.459
Hey.

1178
01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:03.461
How'd it go last night?

1179
01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.213
Uh, with Perry.

1180
01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:07.924
Oh, right. Uh, Perry.
Uh, it's fine.


1181
01:13:08.007 --> 01:13:10.135
I knew he would come around eventually.

1182
01:13:10.218 --> 01:13:12.178
You're just too good to pass up.

1183
01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:13.263
Right.

1184
01:13:14.514 --> 01:13:16.057
What's wrong?

1185
01:13:17.892 --> 01:13:19.519
-It's Him.
-Oh.


1186
01:13:19.602 --> 01:13:21.062
You know, the guy I've been texting with.

1187
01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:22.939
I told Him I went out
with Perry last night,


1188
01:13:23.022 --> 01:13:26.025
and I don't know,
he got all weird about it.


1189
01:13:26.109 --> 01:13:27.569
I feel bad.

1190
01:13:27.652 --> 01:13:29.320
Because you wish it was Him.

1191
01:13:30.321 --> 01:13:31.739
You need to decide what you want.

1192
01:13:31.823 --> 01:13:33.741
A longtime boyfriend
who wants to take next step,


1193
01:13:33.825 --> 01:13:35.577
or some guy you messaged by mistake,

1194
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:37.203
who you may never actually meet.

1195
01:13:37.287 --> 01:13:40.790
I mean, you two are definitely
made for each other.


1196
01:14:01.769 --> 01:14:02.770
Hey.

1197
01:14:05.648 --> 01:14:06.858
Hey.

1198
01:14:06.941 --> 01:14:08.776
There's something I wanted to say.

1199
01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:11.112
Yeah.

1200
01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.781
Good luck.

1201
01:14:16.117 --> 01:14:19.412
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good luck to you too.


1202
01:14:22.749 --> 01:14:25.335
Okay, okay, what is going on?

1203
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:30.256
With... what exactly?

1204
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.383
Well, you just haven't been
acting like yourself.


1205
01:14:33.718 --> 01:14:35.678
Isn't that a good thing,
considering how you feel about me?


1206
01:14:35.762 --> 01:14:37.555
Okay, first you call truce,

1207
01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.807
then you don't park in my spot
for the first time in weeks,


1208
01:14:39.891 --> 01:14:42.727
but then I see you getting all buddy-buddy
with Craig right before our pitches.


1209
01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:43.895
It's not what it looks like.

1210
01:14:43.978 --> 01:14:46.105
-Yeah, go ahead, deny it.
-Look...


1211
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:47.941
there's something that you need to know.

1212
01:14:48.024 --> 01:14:49.776
You don't think I know
what you're doing?


1213
01:14:49.859 --> 01:14:51.486
You're trying to get my head,
and it's not gonna work.


1214
01:14:51.569 --> 01:14:53.112
-If you'd just let me finish.
-No!


1215
01:14:53.196 --> 01:14:55.615
I'm not gonna let you trip me up.

1216
01:14:55.698 --> 01:14:57.200
You know what, Crawford?

1217
01:14:57.283 --> 01:14:59.202
No matter how this pitch goes today,

1218
01:14:59.285 --> 01:15:01.996
when this is all done,
I never wanna talk to you again.


1219
01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.812
So, if you look here...

1220
01:15:25.895 --> 01:15:27.605
Mm-hmm, yeah.

1221
01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:30.149
-I wanna show you--
-Yes.


1222
01:15:30.233 --> 01:15:33.278
Okay, who wants to go first?

1223
01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:35.238
I think Alexa should go first.

1224
01:15:36.572 --> 01:15:38.074
Alexa?

1225
01:15:38.157 --> 01:15:39.158
-Yeah.
-Great.


1226
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:47.083
And finally, I want to talk about family.

1227
01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:49.085
Your father would be so proud

1228
01:15:49.168 --> 01:15:51.170
with how you've grown this business.

1229
01:15:51.254 --> 01:15:53.673
As someone once said,
there's a little bit of his spirit


1230
01:15:53.756 --> 01:15:55.258
in every bottle of Goodwin wine.

1231
01:15:55.341 --> 01:15:59.721
And I want the consumer
to connect with that spirit.


1232
01:15:59.804 --> 01:16:03.016
When you're invited to someone's house
for dinner, what do you bring?


1233
01:16:03.099 --> 01:16:05.059
A nice bottle of wine.

1234
01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:08.938
When you go to your best friend's house
for a nice quiet evening,


1235
01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:10.732
what do you bring?

1236
01:16:10.815 --> 01:16:12.984
A nice bottle of wine

1237
01:16:13.067 --> 01:16:17.280
because you need that special
touch only wine can provide,


1238
01:16:17.363 --> 01:16:19.073
because Goodwin wine...

1239
01:16:23.703 --> 01:16:25.663
is good for the heart.

1240
01:16:27.498 --> 01:16:29.500
Thank you for that, Alexa.

1241
01:16:33.004 --> 01:16:35.548
That's a tough act to follow.

1242
01:16:35.631 --> 01:16:36.966
Yeah.

1243
01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:39.719
Good.

1244
01:16:46.934 --> 01:16:49.854
I was gonna come up here
and do my thing.


1245
01:16:49.937 --> 01:16:52.857
You know, talk fast,

1246
01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:55.610
throw around a bunch of
empty words like "value,"


1247
01:16:55.693 --> 01:16:58.905
"advantage," "demographics."

1248
01:16:58.988 --> 01:17:03.326
But although it looks like
I'm in complete control...


1249
01:17:05.078 --> 01:17:06.537
I'm not.

1250
01:17:08.956 --> 01:17:10.208
What are you doing?

1251
01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:11.667
I've always said that

1252
01:17:11.751 --> 01:17:15.171
thinking you can be in control of anything
is nothing but a pipedream.


1253
01:17:17.298 --> 01:17:20.218
After all, Allen Saunders famously said,

1254
01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:24.514
"Life is what happens
while you're busy making other plans."


1255
01:17:28.351 --> 01:17:30.353
What if Allen Saunders was wrong?

1256
01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:35.817
Maybe it's not just about
living in the moment.


1257
01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:39.821
Maybe you need to be invested.

1258
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.699
Like her.

1259
01:17:45.451 --> 01:17:46.619
She's smart,

1260
01:17:47.203 --> 01:17:48.413
driven...

1261
01:17:49.997 --> 01:17:51.541
organized,

1262
01:17:51.624 --> 01:17:53.126
meticulous.

1263
01:17:55.711 --> 01:17:58.172
You'd be fortunate
to have her on your team.


1264
01:18:01.259 --> 01:18:02.427
I'm confused.

1265
01:18:04.929 --> 01:18:08.182
When you saw me talking
to Craig this morning...


1266
01:18:09.267 --> 01:18:11.644
I was telling him he'd be a fool
not to go with you.


1267
01:18:15.356 --> 01:18:16.482
That's true.

1268
01:18:19.652 --> 01:18:20.653
So...

1269
01:18:22.488 --> 01:18:23.739
congratulations.

1270
01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:38.713
I really like that young man.

1271
01:18:50.808 --> 01:18:54.687
I have no idea
what just happened in there,


1272
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:58.441
but what you did was really special.

1273
01:18:59.817 --> 01:19:02.445
Yeah, well, she's better than me.

1274
01:19:02.528 --> 01:19:04.071
She deserves it.

1275
01:19:04.155 --> 01:19:07.033
Do you remember what I told you
in that first meeting?


1276
01:19:08.784 --> 01:19:10.703
Yeah, that we bicker like your parents.

1277
01:19:10.786 --> 01:19:13.664
And that your competitive nature

1278
01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:16.250
brings out the best in both of you.

1279
01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:19.462
I couldn't have chosen
one of you over the other.


1280
01:19:20.546 --> 01:19:23.132
But together,
I knew you'd make magic.


1281
01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:26.010
And what I just
saw in there proves it.

1282
01:19:26.093 --> 01:19:28.346
You guys are gonna make a great team.

1283
01:19:29.722 --> 01:19:31.432
I'm not sure Alexa would agree with that.

1284
01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:33.893
Maybe, maybe not.

1285
01:19:35.603 --> 01:19:38.189
Congratulations, co-director.

1286
01:19:39.315 --> 01:19:40.900
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


1287
01:20:47.258 --> 01:20:49.176
Can we talk about this?

1288
01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:00.146
I'm sorry.

1289
01:21:01.689 --> 01:21:05.610
But I'm not sorry it turned out to be you
on the other end of this.


1290
01:21:08.779 --> 01:21:10.281
I miss you.

1291
01:22:17.515 --> 01:22:19.433
I can't believe you're Him.

1292
01:22:22.144 --> 01:22:23.771
Yeah.

1293
01:22:23.854 --> 01:22:25.272
I didn't see that coming either.

1294
01:22:25.356 --> 01:22:28.734
A few weeks ago, a few days ago,

1295
01:22:28.818 --> 01:22:31.529
I'm pretty sure I hated you.

1296
01:22:33.572 --> 01:22:35.783
Yeah. We just didn't know each other.

1297
01:22:36.367 --> 01:22:38.202
But now we do?

1298
01:22:40.579 --> 01:22:42.039
Look, I have questions.

1299
01:22:43.457 --> 01:22:44.500
Okay.

1300
01:22:44.583 --> 01:22:47.837
Like... how long have you known?

1301
01:22:50.172 --> 01:22:53.676
Uh, I figured it
out a couple days ago.

1302
01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:55.761
Trey told me the numbers were sequential.

1303
01:22:56.762 --> 01:22:57.930
I asked Brad for Hannah's number

1304
01:22:58.013 --> 01:23:01.183
and saw that it was
the exact same as mine...


1305
01:23:01.267 --> 01:23:02.601
-...except for the last two numbers.
-The last two numbers.


1306
01:23:02.685 --> 01:23:03.978
Well, aren't you clever.

1307
01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.189
No. If I was clever...

1308
01:23:09.275 --> 01:23:10.818
I would have seen
it a long time ago.

1309
01:23:10.901 --> 01:23:12.319
Would have seen what?

1310
01:23:14.822 --> 01:23:16.240
That I love you.

1311
01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:18.993
You what?

1312
01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.412
You heard me.

1313
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:28.335
I mean, what happened to no names,
no work talk, no reason to lie?


1314
01:23:32.256 --> 01:23:33.758
I made other plans.

1315
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:38.971
Well, then say it again.

1316
01:23:40.765 --> 01:23:42.683
I love you.

1317
01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:45.269
Do you love me--

1318
01:23:56.530 --> 01:23:59.825
We should probably
get to work now, co-director.


1319
01:23:59.909 --> 01:24:03.370
Oh, look at this.
It's gone to her head already.


1320
01:24:03.454 --> 01:24:05.539
I'm just glad I was around so
you could ride on my coattails.


1321
01:24:05.623 --> 01:24:08.167
And another thing: We need to talk
about the parking situation.


1322
01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:10.169
Just because you're upwardly mobile now

1323
01:24:10.252 --> 01:24:11.962
doesn't mean you get to park
in any spot you want.


1324
01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:13.339
So you have to walk
a couple of spaces.


1325
01:24:13.422 --> 01:24:14.757
It's not that big a deal.

1326
01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.759
You're always concerned
with the wrong things.


1327
01:24:16.842 --> 01:24:18.719
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
