2
00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:16.981
Searching for the reasons,

3
00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:19.440
was essentially pointless.

4
00:06:19.522 --> 00:06:21.106
How it all started?

5
00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:23.897
Well, at the end of that question

6
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:26.273
what you hope to find
is a person to blame.


7
00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:30.522
Someone who messed up the
party for everyone else.


8
00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:33.731
Some guy high up the food
chain who pushed the button.


9
00:06:36.064 --> 00:06:37.398
And if that doesn't work,

10
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.897
a force of nature or some
higher power comes in handy


11
00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:42.731
as an excuse.

12
00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:45.605
At least so we can tell ourselves
that we weren't to blame.


13
00:06:47.564 --> 00:06:49.689
It wasn't for any one
reason the world came


14
00:06:49.772 --> 00:06:51.189
to be what it is now.

15
00:06:52.148 --> 00:06:54.189
In the end,

16
00:06:54.273 --> 00:06:55.522
we were all guilty.

17
00:06:56.564 --> 00:06:59.897
When you pass the tipping
point there's no way back.


18
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:01.897
When devastating sickness drives the world

19
00:07:01.981 --> 00:07:05.398
into a war involving almost
every nation that is left.


20
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.981
When families maul each other
over the last drop of water.


21
00:07:09.064 --> 00:07:12.772
When society has given up.

22
00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:15.315
Then there's only one thing left, I.

23
00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:17.981
No us,

24
00:07:18.064 --> 00:07:19.480
no we,

25
00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.398
no they,

26
00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:23.356
everyone for themselves.

27
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.606
Which leaves no other option,

28
00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.814
than each one against
the other, I suppose.


29
00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:30.023
Back to the survival of the fittest,

30
00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:33.023
seems like only a few
turn out to be fit enough


31
00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:33.981
to begin with.

32
00:07:35.398 --> 00:07:37.398
I don't know of
anyone else who made it.

33
00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:39.856
I don't need to either.

34
00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:46.189
Life has changed,

35
00:07:46.273 --> 00:07:49.480
one might say for the worse
but I'm not the judge.


36
00:07:49.564 --> 00:07:51.981
You have to earn your survival.

37
00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:56.647
You gotta eat, build a
fire and defend yourself.


38
00:07:56.731 --> 00:07:58.731
Because no one else
will do it for you.

39
00:08:02.606 --> 00:08:04.231
You learn things quickly,

40
00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:05.148
you have to.

41
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:17.856
Success and failure, life and death,

42
00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:19.522
more connected than ever.

43
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.481
You're the first person
I've seen in months.


44
00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:51.731
I don't even know how long it's been.

45
00:10:54.731 --> 00:10:55.606
What day it is.

46
00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:03.065
But who's keeping track, right?

47
00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:08.939
It's the 27th,

48
00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:11.689
August,

49
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:14.814
Monday.

50
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:19.106
You counted, smart.

51
00:11:20.898 --> 00:11:22.689
So, what's your story?

52
00:11:22.773 --> 00:11:23.773
Is this your trap?

53
00:11:25.314 --> 00:11:26.606
Yeah.

54
00:11:26.689 --> 00:11:27.606
Found a bunch of them right out-

55
00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:28.439
You've eaten rats?

56
00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:29.272
What?

57
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.522
Kid, you can roast them black.

58
00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:33.190
You'll still die of
infection if you eat them.


59
00:11:33.272 --> 00:11:34.689
You don't think I know that?

60
00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:38.148
Jesus, man, how do you
think I survived in here?


61
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.023
Those traps are there to protect me.

62
00:11:42.898 --> 00:11:45.439
- Where are you headed?
- What do you care?


63
00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:48.731
Hey, you're Mr. Cheerful.

64
00:11:49.814 --> 00:11:51.023
I'm headed to a shelter.

65
00:11:53.148 --> 00:11:54.439
I don't know what your plans are,

66
00:11:54.522 --> 00:11:59.522
but I thought maybe we could team up.

67
00:12:05.564 --> 00:12:07.522
I know where to find water.

68
00:12:07.606 --> 00:12:08.439
Where?

69
00:12:09.397 --> 00:12:10.272
Well, if you follow that line

70
00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:11.564
- of trees out there-
- Show me.


71
00:12:14.065 --> 00:12:15.564
Hey, you got a map!

72
00:12:15.648 --> 00:12:17.397
Must have come a long way, huh?

73
00:12:17.481 --> 00:12:19.898
I'm a bit more of a camper myself,

74
00:12:19.981 --> 00:12:21.981
till I ran out of supplies.

75
00:12:22.065 --> 00:12:25.606
Anyway, it should be right around here.

76
00:12:25.689 --> 00:12:28.606
No, I'm not going there.

77
00:12:28.689 --> 00:12:30.856
I only move in this direction.

78
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.481
Yeah but, you know
there are people there.


79
00:12:33.564 --> 00:12:35.773
I'm not going there.

80
00:12:38.356 --> 00:12:39.898
Don't you wanna find anybody?

81
00:12:40.731 --> 00:12:42.230
More mouths to feed.

82
00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:46.023
Jesus, man.

83
00:12:48.272 --> 00:12:49.106
So then what?

84
00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:51.189
That's it?

85
00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:57.147
Look, kid, I'm heading in
this direction all the way down


86
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.147
to the river source.

87
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.147
No discussion.

88
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:01.481
I hope to find water there.

89
00:13:02.856 --> 00:13:05.105
Now, if I were you, I
wouldn't go this way.


90
00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:09.356
You won't find anything or anyone.

91
00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:11.856
There's nothing there for you.

92
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:13.773
Good luck then.

93
00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:48.940
Hey!

94
00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:52.356
Last chance, kid.

95
00:13:55.606 --> 00:13:57.606
You always get up this early?

96
00:13:57.689 --> 00:13:59.773
No, sometimes earlier.

97
00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:01.689
My God!

98
00:14:02.856 --> 00:14:04.314
My name is Joshua by the way.

99
00:14:06.231 --> 00:14:07.064
Alexander.

100
00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:10.981
Well, then good morning.

101
00:14:15.648 --> 00:14:18.648
Someone might be able to help
you get your things organized.


102
00:14:20.064 --> 00:14:21.189
Lend you an ear...

103
00:14:21.272 --> 00:14:23.481
- Yeah.
- That sort of stuff.


104
00:14:23.564 --> 00:14:25.606
You really only get that in a group.

105
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.898
Look, all I'm saying is that I've heard

106
00:14:30.981 --> 00:14:33.147
that there are people at
that shelter, and I think we,


107
00:14:37.272 --> 00:14:38.189
what is it?

108
00:15:11.147 --> 00:15:12.356
Alexander!

109
00:15:13.481 --> 00:15:14.773
Hey, Alexander, over here!

110
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.815
Up ahead!

111
00:15:22.356 --> 00:15:24.689
Will you shut the hell up!

112
00:15:31.022 --> 00:15:32.980
Come on, we gotta pick up the pace.

113
00:15:36.439 --> 00:15:38.064
What the hell is your problem?

114
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:43.231
My problem is I don't
wanna get killed out here.


115
00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:44.856
By what?

116
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.147
We're being followed.

117
00:15:46.231 --> 00:15:48.439
Who do you think is
following us out here?


118
00:15:48.523 --> 00:15:52.648
It's not a person, it's something else.

119
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:54.189
I've seen it kill someone.

120
00:15:54.272 --> 00:15:55.106
Now move!

121
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:04.606
What the hell is wrong with you?

122
00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:08.648
Listen, there's some
kinda creature out there.


123
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:13.606
It caught someone I've been traveling with

124
00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:16.564
and injected poison into him right here.

125
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:21.231
You don't wanna get caught
by this thing, I don't.


126
00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.272
I'd rather kill myself.

127
00:16:27.022 --> 00:16:28.398
You have a gun, why
didn't you just shoot it?


128
00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:31.398
Yeah, my guy had a gun too.

129
00:16:31.481 --> 00:16:32.689
It didn't save his life.

130
00:16:33.648 --> 00:16:36.980
Look, if you wanna survive out here,

131
00:16:37.064 --> 00:16:39.147
there's some things you gotta learn.

132
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.856
Never go back.

133
00:16:40.939 --> 00:16:42.523
Never stand still.

134
00:16:46.147 --> 00:16:48.690
- Lead the way...
- And stay quiet!


135
00:17:08.231 --> 00:17:09.564
Drink something.

136
00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:15.272
It's all I got.

137
00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:18.897
Save it then.

138
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:20.772
We are going to a well, remember?

139
00:17:25.314 --> 00:17:27.897
How do you know it's not dried
up, like everywhere else?


140
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:29.022
It's a gut feeling.

141
00:17:47.523 --> 00:17:48.356
We're here.

142
00:17:49.398 --> 00:17:50.231
Here?

143
00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:53.189
Must be somewhere around here.

144
00:17:57.814 --> 00:17:59.356
I can't see it.

145
00:17:59.439 --> 00:18:00.606
So help me find it.

146
00:18:37.106 --> 00:18:38.106
Alexander.

147
00:18:39.648 --> 00:18:41.022
Alexander!

148
00:18:41.106 --> 00:18:43.481
Tell me, this wasn't complete bullshit.

149
00:18:46.855 --> 00:18:50.356
Fuck, I knew we should've
gone the other way!


150
00:18:50.439 --> 00:18:51.565
Why didn't you listen to me?

151
00:18:51.648 --> 00:18:53.064
- Keep your voice down.
- What?


152
00:18:53.147 --> 00:18:54.731
You expect to find water?

153
00:18:54.814 --> 00:18:56.064
Just like that?

154
00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:58.189
A nice, clean fountain,

155
00:18:58.273 --> 00:19:00.439
- or maybe with a rainbow?
- Cut it, kid, shut up.


156
00:19:00.523 --> 00:19:02.022
We need to find supplies!

157
00:19:03.314 --> 00:19:06.106
I have survived on bottled water only.

158
00:19:06.189 --> 00:19:08.690
I haven't seen a single
fucking drop out here.


159
00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:10.439
So what makes you think,
you're so much better at this?


160
00:19:10.523 --> 00:19:11.939
It's the source, all right?

161
00:19:15.106 --> 00:19:16.064
It's just dried up.

162
00:19:19.855 --> 00:19:21.106
What is it with you?

163
00:19:21.189 --> 00:19:23.189
We need to go back!

164
00:19:23.273 --> 00:19:26.273
There are people at that
shelter and there's water.


165
00:19:26.356 --> 00:19:28.022
There, that direction.

166
00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:30.690
Go ahead and die then, genius.

167
00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:35.189
Wait, wait, wait!

168
00:19:36.231 --> 00:19:37.064
Wait.

169
00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:43.064
It's getting dark.

170
00:19:44.064 --> 00:19:45.730
I say we lay our heads
down for a few hours


171
00:19:45.814 --> 00:19:47.606
and see where we're at, all right?

172
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.481
There's a gap in the rocks up there.

173
00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.523
Seems like a pretty save
place to me, what do you say?


174
00:20:18.148 --> 00:20:19.648
You found water.

175
00:21:03.606 --> 00:21:05.064
So we found your water.

176
00:21:07.398 --> 00:21:10.022
I'd say we go back, to the people.

177
00:21:12.356 --> 00:21:15.022
- Not today, of course.
- We got water.


178
00:21:17.106 --> 00:21:18.148
That's what I said.

179
00:21:19.022 --> 00:21:22.440
It's just enough to reach
the larger lakes up North-East.


180
00:21:22.523 --> 00:21:23.981
I've already marked it, here.

181
00:21:24.856 --> 00:21:26.814
I came here with you.

182
00:21:26.897 --> 00:21:28.856
And I only ask for this one thing...

183
00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:30.481
I wasn't shitting you earlier.

184
00:21:30.565 --> 00:21:31.356
There is something out there.

185
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.523
Even if there is something out there,

186
00:21:32.605 --> 00:21:34.814
what are the odds of walking into it?

187
00:21:34.897 --> 00:21:35.731
With you?

188
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:40.064
You can take your share of the water.

189
00:21:54.148 --> 00:21:56.565
You'd just let me go, huh?

190
00:21:56.647 --> 00:21:57.981
You tell me, there's
this horrible creature


191
00:21:58.064 --> 00:21:59.605
and that I die
if I go out there

192
00:21:59.689 --> 00:22:02.231
and you just gonna fucking let me go?

193
00:22:02.314 --> 00:22:04.231
All I'm saying is, you're a free man.

194
00:22:07.398 --> 00:22:10.231
Yeah, thanks for nothing.

195
00:22:13.106 --> 00:22:13.939
I'm staying.

196
00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:17.148
Make sure it's closed.

197
00:22:47.814 --> 00:22:48.647
Fuck!

198
00:22:52.273 --> 00:22:53.356
What are you doing?

199
00:22:57.481 --> 00:22:58.897
I told you to close it.

200
00:23:08.564 --> 00:23:10.148
I did close it.

201
00:23:10.231 --> 00:23:11.564
Look, it ate right through.

202
00:23:13.647 --> 00:23:14.564
What do we do now?

203
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.606
We're not gonna make it.

204
00:23:49.689 --> 00:23:52.023
We still have our bottles.

205
00:23:53.189 --> 00:23:55.189
The lakes are too far.

206
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:02.480
We have other options, you know?

207
00:24:02.564 --> 00:24:04.440
We could still go back to the shelter.

208
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:07.647
This was you.

209
00:24:10.981 --> 00:24:12.356
This was your plan!

210
00:24:12.439 --> 00:24:14.023
You son of a bitch!

211
00:24:14.106 --> 00:24:15.606
Why did you do it?

212
00:24:16.939 --> 00:24:19.273
Do you know what you've done?

213
00:24:19.356 --> 00:24:22.148
Do you have the slightest
idea what you've done?


214
00:24:22.231 --> 00:24:25.189
I didn't do it,
it was a fucking rat!

215
00:24:25.273 --> 00:24:26.189
Prove it!

216
00:24:28.023 --> 00:24:29.564
This was my water, too, okay?

217
00:24:50.439 --> 00:24:52.315
You know that doesn't work.

218
00:24:52.397 --> 00:24:53.731
You said so yourself.

219
00:24:55.397 --> 00:24:56.647
You can roast them black.

220
00:25:00.064 --> 00:25:01.064
We should go back.

221
00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:10.023
How do you know we'll find water?

222
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:13.273
It's a gut feeling.

223
00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:23.356
Is that a Geiger counter?

224
00:25:28.647 --> 00:25:31.981
You're always busy with
that thing, what's it for?


225
00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:34.731
That thing out there I told you about.

226
00:25:34.814 --> 00:25:37.355
Somehow this has proven
reliable on detecting it.


227
00:25:38.939 --> 00:25:40.981
Saved my life a couple of times already.

228
00:25:42.397 --> 00:25:43.731
You got batteries for it?

229
00:25:44.856 --> 00:25:46.731
One, in here.

230
00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:52.939
You think it could power my phone?

231
00:25:53.898 --> 00:25:55.397
Your what?

232
00:25:55.481 --> 00:25:57.355
You got someone you wanna call, kid?

233
00:25:57.439 --> 00:25:58.273
No.

234
00:26:00.355 --> 00:26:02.647
I have some pictures on there, that's all.

235
00:26:09.315 --> 00:26:10.148
Sorry.

236
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:19.148
You don't like talking
much about yourself, do you?


237
00:26:19.231 --> 00:26:20.148
You got a family?

238
00:26:22.939 --> 00:26:23.689
Where are you from?

239
00:26:23.773 --> 00:26:25.606
You must have someone who misses you.

240
00:26:25.689 --> 00:26:26.856
None of your business.

241
00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:31.231
I was part of a group.

242
00:26:33.314 --> 00:26:35.106
That's probably why I'm still alive.

243
00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:39.606
We were staying at that storage place,

244
00:26:39.689 --> 00:26:43.731
we had food and water.

245
00:26:43.814 --> 00:26:44.814
Why did you leave?

246
00:26:45.856 --> 00:26:47.190
We used it up eventually.

247
00:26:48.981 --> 00:26:50.023
We were three people.

248
00:26:52.106 --> 00:26:53.689
The other two were lovers.

249
00:26:57.439 --> 00:26:58.647
They met after all this.

250
00:27:01.689 --> 00:27:03.314
They fell for each other I guess.

251
00:27:04.397 --> 00:27:08.397
Wouldn't you know it, that's my luck.

252
00:27:08.481 --> 00:27:09.773
It's the end of the world.

253
00:27:10.689 --> 00:27:14.065
And I meet possibly the
last woman on earth,


254
00:27:15.397 --> 00:27:16.231
and she's taken.

255
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:20.689
You know, sometimes you
forget what they look like.


256
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.023
The smell,

257
00:27:24.939 --> 00:27:25.773
the hair,

258
00:27:28.481 --> 00:27:30.065
the other guy was an alpha-male.

259
00:27:32.564 --> 00:27:33.731
He wasn't into sharing.

260
00:27:36.397 --> 00:27:39.439
Can't say I blame the
man, but why did you leave?


261
00:27:41.314 --> 00:27:43.647
Well, lovers have a
way of sticking together.


262
00:27:44.898 --> 00:27:46.731
Down to the last can of macaroni,

263
00:27:49.065 --> 00:27:52.106
that's what got them, food poisoning.

264
00:27:54.314 --> 00:27:55.397
It turns out expiration dates,

265
00:27:55.481 --> 00:27:57.356
are more than just a marketing scheme.

266
00:27:58.606 --> 00:28:02.481
After she died, we
had a fight, split up.

267
00:28:06.689 --> 00:28:09.106
You don't really see much of
anyone anymore around here.


268
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.522
I went back, eventually.

269
00:28:12.606 --> 00:28:13.814
So you found him then?

270
00:28:15.314 --> 00:28:17.397
Dead, yeah.

271
00:28:18.981 --> 00:28:21.397
Probably starved or something.

272
00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:22.397
Did you eat him?

273
00:28:24.148 --> 00:28:24.981
No!

274
00:28:27.189 --> 00:28:30.023
I'm messing with you, kid.

275
00:28:30.106 --> 00:28:33.397
All right, listen, I've
been doing all right,


276
00:28:33.481 --> 00:28:34.898
given the circumstances.

277
00:28:36.189 --> 00:28:38.731
I don't need to hang on to
any group or leader desperate


278
00:28:38.814 --> 00:28:40.148
for guidance or whatever.

279
00:28:41.148 --> 00:28:43.606
I move where I move and I
don't search for people.


280
00:28:44.773 --> 00:28:47.272
I've made my point by
staying alive this far.


281
00:29:18.065 --> 00:29:19.606
We'll set up camp here.

282
00:29:19.689 --> 00:29:20.940
Find some wood.

283
00:30:58.189 --> 00:30:59.731
What was that song you played?

284
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:03.981
The song you played.

285
00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.773
Chopin.

286
00:31:07.814 --> 00:31:08.648
Nocturnes.

287
00:31:10.272 --> 00:31:11.189
You a musician?

288
00:31:13.523 --> 00:31:16.022
No, not really.

289
00:31:22.022 --> 00:31:24.689
Is that the only one you know?

290
00:31:27.481 --> 00:31:28.314
Couple more.

291
00:31:37.147 --> 00:31:40.731
Jesus, Alex, if you want
me to play more, just ask.


292
00:32:27.189 --> 00:32:28.022
You all right?

293
00:32:29.231 --> 00:32:31.648
How do you survive on so little water?

294
00:32:35.064 --> 00:32:37.022
Here, suck on a stone.

295
00:32:42.898 --> 00:32:45.147
You're kidding me, right?

296
00:32:46.815 --> 00:32:48.189
It stimulates the saliva.

297
00:32:49.439 --> 00:32:52.106
Doesn't change anything but
it helps with the thirst.


298
00:32:57.106 --> 00:32:59.147
It's all right, 
I cleaned them thoroughly

299
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.773
- Doesn't work.
- Give it time.


300
00:33:14.022 --> 00:33:15.314
My mouth is all dry.

301
00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:43.189
You need it.

302
00:33:43.272 --> 00:33:44.314
Take it, I'm good.

303
00:33:54.231 --> 00:33:55.064
Thanks.

304
00:34:13.939 --> 00:34:16.064
The damage a rat can do.

305
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:34.105
Hey.

306
00:34:34.189 --> 00:34:35.022
Hello!

307
00:34:36.313 --> 00:34:37.981
Last warning, kid!

308
00:34:55.439 --> 00:34:57.106
Hey, stay behind me.

309
00:35:30.897 --> 00:35:31.731
Fuck you!

310
00:35:33.189 --> 00:35:35.606
If we'd come here sooner
they would have been alive.


311
00:35:37.106 --> 00:35:38.189
This was suicide.

312
00:35:39.855 --> 00:35:42.439
And what do you think
you would have found here?


313
00:35:42.523 --> 00:35:44.897
Why do you think they killed themselves?

314
00:35:44.981 --> 00:35:47.690
You think they were having a good time?

315
00:35:47.772 --> 00:35:48.772
You think they had water

316
00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:51.356
or anything else you'd hoped to find?

317
00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:52.273
Here.

318
00:35:53.106 --> 00:35:54.064
They'd be alive.

319
00:35:54.147 --> 00:35:55.523
You stupid piece of shit!

320
00:35:58.606 --> 00:35:59.939
Hey!

321
00:36:00.022 --> 00:36:00.772
Hey!

322
00:36:00.856 --> 00:36:03.356
You idiot, that's the thing!

323
00:36:20.523 --> 00:36:21.356
Hey!

324
00:37:18.439 --> 00:37:20.814
What the fuck!

325
00:37:20.897 --> 00:37:21.730
Fuck.

326
00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:29.856
Fuck!

327
00:38:29.939 --> 00:38:32.022
- Alexander! Alexander!
- Calm down, calm down.


328
00:38:32.106 --> 00:38:32.897
What the fuck!

329
00:38:32.981 --> 00:38:34.189
Tell me! Tell me, where is it?

330
00:38:34.273 --> 00:38:36.647
- Where is it?
- It's behind me!


331
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:38.731
Come on, Come on!

332
00:38:38.814 --> 00:38:39.647
Come on!

333
00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:56.564
Listen to me just this
one time and shut up.


334
00:38:56.647 --> 00:38:58.814
I will get us out of here.

335
00:40:52.564 --> 00:40:53.689
We lost the map.

336
00:41:00.356 --> 00:41:01.189
I'm sorry.

337
00:41:03.647 --> 00:41:06.356
- I didn't mean to put us in...
- We made it, all right?


338
00:41:09.689 --> 00:41:11.731
- You saved me, man!
- Whatever.


339
00:41:12.981 --> 00:41:14.273
Next time listen to me.

340
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.689
You need to trust me.

341
00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:24.273
I wanted to fix it.

342
00:41:26.148 --> 00:41:27.564
I want to make things right.

343
00:41:29.023 --> 00:41:30.064
Be a team, you know?

344
00:41:33.397 --> 00:41:34.856
I put the rat in the canister.

345
00:41:39.023 --> 00:41:39.856
I'm sorry.

346
00:41:45.647 --> 00:41:47.522
I didn't know what else I could do.

347
00:41:47.606 --> 00:41:48.689
Hey, Alex!

348
00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:49.647
Hey!

349
00:42:07.231 --> 00:42:09.355
Please, please, sir.

350
00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:12.397
I already told you
lady, I don't help scabs.


351
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.397
It's not for me.

352
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.439
It's for my daughter, two tickets.

353
00:42:16.355 --> 00:42:17.106
What are you, deaf?

354
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.522
I ain't interested.

355
00:42:18.606 --> 00:42:19.647
And you have no ticket.

356
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:21.315
How can you get on the ship?

357
00:42:22.564 --> 00:42:23.647
I'll figure it out.

358
00:42:25.106 --> 00:42:28.190
This
is all I have, please.


359
00:42:28.273 --> 00:42:30.647
Pure silver, you can sell for good money.

360
00:42:32.856 --> 00:42:35.898
It is too late for me,
but she still has time.


361
00:42:35.981 --> 00:42:37.856
If she could only
make it to the ship.

362
00:42:40.064 --> 00:42:41.397
She looks scrawny.

363
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:42.315
She is strong.

364
00:42:42.397 --> 00:42:43.647
She can keep up.

365
00:42:44.522 --> 00:42:46.190
Well, she better
'cause I ain't slowing down.


366
00:42:46.273 --> 00:42:47.772
Oh,
thank you, thank you, sir.


367
00:42:47.856 --> 00:42:50.856
Don't touch me, all right?

368
00:42:52.023 --> 00:42:52.856
Let's go.

369
00:42:58.439 --> 00:42:59.731
Lex, this is...

370
00:43:00.647 --> 00:43:01.481
Cal.

371
00:43:10.773 --> 00:43:11.856
All right, let's move.

372
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:17.731
Lex.

373
00:43:40.856 --> 00:43:42.564
All right, we got to go.

374
00:43:42.647 --> 00:43:44.564
- Mama!
- Come on.


375
00:43:49.939 --> 00:43:50.773
Mama!

376
00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:03.106
Shit, are you all right?

377
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.065
Can you run?

378
00:44:04.148 --> 00:44:04.898
- Mama.
- Hey.


379
00:44:04.981 --> 00:44:06.023
I said can you run?

380
00:44:06.106 --> 00:44:07.231
- Yes.
- Then you run.


381
00:44:07.314 --> 00:44:09.981
Run!

382
00:44:14.439 --> 00:44:15.939
Don't stop, keep running.

383
00:44:17.272 --> 00:44:18.106
I said move!

384
00:44:32.522 --> 00:44:33.272
They won't come into the valley,

385
00:44:33.356 --> 00:44:35.439
until they've cleared the ridge.

386
00:44:35.522 --> 00:44:36.898
Come on, let's keep moving.

387
00:44:57.689 --> 00:45:00.898
We used to come
here when we were kids.

388
00:45:01.939 --> 00:45:03.189
That was a long time ago.

389
00:45:10.648 --> 00:45:12.481
Yeah, this whole valley used
to be some of the best farmland


390
00:45:12.564 --> 00:45:13.397
in the country,

391
00:45:16.397 --> 00:45:17.773
before you scabs showed up.

392
00:45:23.106 --> 00:45:26.731
Bringing that disease,
just ended everything.


393
00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:35.481
Why'd you come here anyway?

394
00:45:38.314 --> 00:45:41.230
My land is a (SPEAKS
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) war.


395
00:45:43.564 --> 00:45:46.230
My papa died, so
my mama take me away.

396
00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:52.606
Yeah, well, you brought
that war here, didn't you?


397
00:45:53.522 --> 00:45:54.564
You've taken our lands, our homes.

398
00:45:54.648 --> 00:45:57.439
You've taken our lives
away from us, you know?


399
00:46:03.898 --> 00:46:07.981
You people should go back
to where you came from.


400
00:46:14.689 --> 00:46:15.522
Shit.

401
00:46:24.397 --> 00:46:26.065
You know how to use one of these?

402
00:46:27.356 --> 00:46:29.065
Point it at the thing you wanna kill,

403
00:46:30.065 --> 00:46:31.189
then you pull on this.

404
00:46:36.606 --> 00:46:40.189
We should be able to make
it halfway by nightfall.


405
00:46:40.272 --> 00:46:41.105
Come on.

406
00:47:15.147 --> 00:47:18.523
So what happened to your father?

407
00:47:18.606 --> 00:47:21.023
The Schebonya come to my village.

408
00:47:21.898 --> 00:47:26.439
My papa fight them and was killed.

409
00:47:28.898 --> 00:47:29.731
That sucks.

410
00:47:30.898 --> 00:47:32.523
It was long time ago.

411
00:47:35.856 --> 00:47:37.064
So how'd you get here?

412
00:47:38.606 --> 00:47:41.272
When the Schebonya come
for me and my mother,


413
00:47:41.356 --> 00:47:43.606
we ran to the house of my uncle.

414
00:47:47.272 --> 00:47:51.147
He give us tickets to
the ship so we come here.


415
00:47:51.231 --> 00:47:54.648
Hiding in ditches, bushes, fields.

416
00:47:59.064 --> 00:48:00.564
You walked all the way here?

417
00:48:01.689 --> 00:48:02.523
Yes.

418
00:48:05.648 --> 00:48:08.856
You used to live in this valley?

419
00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:09.773
Yeah.

420
00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:12.439
Yeah, I did.

421
00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:14.689
What was it like before?

422
00:48:17.731 --> 00:48:18.689
It was beautiful.

423
00:48:20.272 --> 00:48:21.314
There used to be a windmill.

424
00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.481
What is it?

425
00:48:29.564 --> 00:48:31.980
That's trouble.

426
00:48:32.898 --> 00:48:34.439
Grab a stick.

427
00:48:34.523 --> 00:48:35.272
A stick?

428
00:48:35.356 --> 00:48:36.189
Grab something.

429
00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:48.231
We call 'em bogeys,

430
00:48:48.314 --> 00:48:49.689
on account of the boogeyman.

431
00:48:50.648 --> 00:48:53.481
They are coming for us?

432
00:48:53.564 --> 00:48:56.980
Yeah, but they don't like fire,

433
00:48:57.064 --> 00:49:01.481
so they should keep
their distance, unless...


434
00:49:02.856 --> 00:49:03.939
Unless what?

435
00:49:05.564 --> 00:49:06.898
Unless they're not alone.

436
00:49:12.231 --> 00:49:13.064
Oh, boy.

437
00:49:41.856 --> 00:49:43.439
You son of a bitch.

438
00:49:51.648 --> 00:49:52.897
Back, get back!

439
00:49:55.939 --> 00:49:58.022
All right, who wants it?

440
00:50:08.106 --> 00:50:09.439
They are dead?

441
00:50:11.189 --> 00:50:12.022
Yeah.

442
00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:18.272
- Something else is coming?
- Maybe.


443
00:50:19.773 --> 00:50:22.356
I don't know.

444
00:50:22.439 --> 00:50:24.022
I don't know.

445
00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:27.731
You all right?

446
00:50:27.815 --> 00:50:28.648
Yes.

447
00:50:29.648 --> 00:50:30.481
Are you?

448
00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:32.523
Yeah.

449
00:50:35.564 --> 00:50:37.897
You should probably try and get some rest.

450
00:50:37.981 --> 00:50:39.939
I'll keep a look out, it's okay.

451
00:50:55.981 --> 00:50:57.439
I will be like them.

452
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:03.523
Soon.

453
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:07.897
I will change and
I will become like them.

454
00:51:08.855 --> 00:51:09.690
No.

455
00:51:11.272 --> 00:51:13.897
You see, they got medicine on that ship.

456
00:51:13.981 --> 00:51:14.814
It can cure you.

457
00:51:17.022 --> 00:51:19.106
We're gonna get you
there and you'll be okay.


458
00:51:22.523 --> 00:51:24.106
You are good man, Cal.

459
00:51:28.981 --> 00:51:29.981
You get some rest.

460
00:51:32.147 --> 00:51:33.606
We got a ways to go tomorrow.

461
00:52:56.231 --> 00:52:58.648
- We are almost there.
- Whoa.


462
00:52:59.523 --> 00:53:03.147
- What is it?
- I don't know.


463
00:53:03.231 --> 00:53:04.314
I don't know.

464
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:08.022
The ship is through this forest?

465
00:53:08.106 --> 00:53:10.022
Yeah, but something's not right.

466
00:53:13.689 --> 00:53:15.022
You wait here, okay?

467
00:53:15.106 --> 00:53:18.022
- But what about...
- Just wait here.


468
00:53:19.273 --> 00:53:20.439
Be right back.

469
00:54:07.647 --> 00:54:08.481
Shit.

470
00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:21.356
Hey, come on, the coast is clear.

471
00:54:22.356 --> 00:54:23.356
Come on, let's go.

472
00:54:37.189 --> 00:54:38.189
Cal.

473
00:54:40.148 --> 00:54:40.981
Oh, shit.

474
00:54:42.148 --> 00:54:43.605
Run!

475
00:54:43.689 --> 00:54:44.523
Run!

476
00:54:48.189 --> 00:54:50.106
Run, Lex, run!

477
00:55:11.189 --> 00:55:12.273
You goddamn scabs.

478
00:55:19.731 --> 00:55:20.440
Fuck.

479
00:55:20.523 --> 00:55:21.981
It's all gone, you happy?

480
00:55:22.064 --> 00:55:23.106
This makes you happy?

481
00:55:39.148 --> 00:55:39.981
Holy shit.

482
00:55:45.189 --> 00:55:46.064
Cal!

483
00:55:46.148 --> 00:55:46.981
Lex?

484
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.523
Lex, look out.

485
00:55:54.148 --> 00:55:55.647
Lex?

486
00:55:55.731 --> 00:55:57.106
Lex!

487
00:55:57.189 --> 00:55:57.939
Cal!

488
00:55:58.023 --> 00:55:59.231
Are you all right?

489
00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:00.064
Am I all right?

490
00:56:00.148 --> 00:56:01.356
How are you alive?

491
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.856
I swear I saw her
shoot you in the back.

492
00:56:03.939 --> 00:56:06.148
She destroyed the pack.

493
00:56:06.231 --> 00:56:08.772
Oh, man, and you shot her?

494
00:56:10.814 --> 00:56:12.023
It was a good shot.

495
00:56:12.106 --> 00:56:13.273
It was a damn good shot.

496
00:56:14.856 --> 00:56:16.315
Are you all right?

497
00:56:18.231 --> 00:56:20.440
Well, I got shot in the back.

498
00:56:20.522 --> 00:56:21.356
Holy shit.

499
00:56:23.481 --> 00:56:24.315
Let me see.

500
00:56:33.023 --> 00:56:34.189
Can you stand?

501
00:56:35.148 --> 00:56:36.481
Yeah, I think so.

502
00:56:42.356 --> 00:56:44.231
I thought you had left me.

503
00:56:46.064 --> 00:56:47.772
No, I wouldn't leave you.

504
00:56:50.564 --> 00:56:53.564
Here, you should have this.

505
00:56:57.106 --> 00:56:59.480
Come on, let's get to the ship.

506
00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:29.606
Do you see anything?

507
00:59:29.689 --> 00:59:30.522
Nothing.

508
00:59:31.731 --> 00:59:33.064
They must be down there, though.

509
00:59:33.148 --> 00:59:34.231
I would assume.

510
00:59:36.731 --> 00:59:38.647
How much charge do you have?

511
00:59:38.731 --> 00:59:41.564
Enough for five shots, maybe.

512
00:59:41.647 --> 00:59:42.522
All right.

513
00:59:44.355 --> 00:59:45.939
And we're sure there's meds down there?

514
00:59:46.023 --> 00:59:47.522
It is a mobile clinic.

515
00:59:48.898 --> 00:59:49.731
Okay.

516
00:59:51.064 --> 00:59:51.898
You stay here.

517
00:59:53.023 --> 00:59:56.231
If anything moves, you
shoot it, understand?


518
00:59:56.314 --> 00:59:57.106
Duh.

519
00:59:58.148 --> 00:59:59.148
All right.

520
01:00:01.814 --> 01:00:02.647
All right.

521
01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:35.731
No,

522
01:00:36.689 --> 01:00:37.439
no.

523
01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:51.231
Bingo.

524
01:01:08.606 --> 01:01:10.939
Hello, what do we have here?

525
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.023
Typical.

526
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:23.731
Oh crap.

527
01:01:29.731 --> 01:01:30.731
Shoot them!

528
01:01:30.814 --> 01:01:31.939
Shoot them!

529
01:01:46.481 --> 01:01:48.148
Are you all right?

530
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:50.939
No, I'm not all right, Lex!

531
01:01:51.856 --> 01:01:53.814
That thing was two inches from my face!

532
01:01:58.898 --> 01:01:59.814
You look fine.

533
01:02:02.065 --> 01:02:03.106
I look fine.

534
01:02:03.189 --> 01:02:04.814
I look fine?

535
01:02:04.898 --> 01:02:06.606
You're not the one that
had to stand face to face


536
01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:08.814
with these

537
01:02:08.898 --> 01:02:10.314
When I tell you to shoot, you shoot.

538
01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:11.230
Got it?

539
01:02:12.773 --> 01:02:14.481
Hey, got it?

540
01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.106
You don't have to yell at me.

541
01:02:16.939 --> 01:02:18.230
I'm not yelling at you.

542
01:02:18.314 --> 01:02:20.397
I'm just saying you gotta listen to me,

543
01:02:20.481 --> 01:02:22.397
when I tell you to do something, okay?

544
01:02:23.648 --> 01:02:25.106
Did you find anything?

545
01:02:26.648 --> 01:02:29.522
Not much, couple doses.

546
01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:33.272
We have to keep looking, then.

547
01:02:49.564 --> 01:02:50.397
Here

548
01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:56.940
You all right?

549
01:03:00.147 --> 01:03:00.981
Duh.

550
01:03:04.397 --> 01:03:06.065
It's gonna get dark soon.

551
01:03:06.147 --> 01:03:07.814
We should find somewhere to lay low.

552
01:03:07.898 --> 01:03:08.731
Yes.

553
01:03:29.522 --> 01:03:30.648
What you got there?

554
01:03:30.731 --> 01:03:31.689
A picture.

555
01:03:31.773 --> 01:03:33.189
From one of the bogeys.

556
01:03:44.397 --> 01:03:45.231
Down!

557
01:03:47.105 --> 01:03:48.397
That's far enough!

558
01:03:48.481 --> 01:03:49.981
Hello, is someone there?

559
01:03:50.064 --> 01:03:51.314
Turn the light off.

560
01:03:51.397 --> 01:03:52.773
I don't mean you any harm.

561
01:03:52.856 --> 01:03:53.606
Do it!

562
01:03:53.689 --> 01:03:54.523
Yeah, okay, okay.

563
01:03:57.105 --> 01:03:57.898
What do you want?

564
01:03:57.981 --> 01:04:02.189
I just, I saw your light, I...

565
01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.314
You what?

566
01:04:03.397 --> 01:04:05.648
I just thought you
might have some water.


567
01:04:08.272 --> 01:04:09.105
Are you armed?

568
01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:11.606
Yeah, I got a pistol.

569
01:04:11.689 --> 01:04:12.523
Throw it to me.

570
01:04:12.606 --> 01:04:14.272
It doesn't have any charge.

571
01:04:14.356 --> 01:04:15.105
Do it!

572
01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:16.023
Okay, okay.

573
01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:19.189
Now take three steps forward,

574
01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:21.189
then lie with your face
down to the ground.


575
01:04:29.606 --> 01:04:31.064
I'm not gonna hurt you.

576
01:04:31.147 --> 01:04:32.356
Lie down.

577
01:04:32.439 --> 01:04:34.314
Hands where I can see them.

578
01:04:34.397 --> 01:04:35.815
Cal, she's not going to hurt us.

579
01:04:35.898 --> 01:04:36.731
You stay here.

580
01:04:47.898 --> 01:04:50.356
Do you have any water?

581
01:04:50.439 --> 01:04:51.481
I'm so thirsty.

582
01:04:52.481 --> 01:04:53.314
Sit up.

583
01:04:55.314 --> 01:04:56.397
Lex, I said stay there!

584
01:04:56.481 --> 01:04:57.940
She's thirsty!

585
01:04:58.022 --> 01:04:58.940
Yeah, but you gotta do what I say!

586
01:04:59.022 --> 01:05:00.231
Let her drink first!

587
01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:01.773
Then you can ask questions.

588
01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:04.606
Easy, easy, not so fast.

589
01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:08.980
What is your name?

590
01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.356
Taylor.

591
01:05:11.439 --> 01:05:14.356
I am Lex and this is Cal.

592
01:05:14.439 --> 01:05:15.397
Good to meet you.

593
01:05:16.815 --> 01:05:18.356
- Cal!
- Wait, what are you doing?


594
01:05:18.439 --> 01:05:20.940
You know what, 
I don't trust her!

595
01:05:21.022 --> 01:05:21.856
I'm gonna keep you restrained.

596
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.397
You can stay with us tonight.

597
01:05:23.481 --> 01:05:24.898
Tomorrow, I'll set you free,

598
01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.648
and you can go your way,
and we go ours, got it?


599
01:05:29.189 --> 01:05:30.689
- Got it?
- Fine.


600
01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:48.815
So, what are you guys doing
out here so far from any town?


601
01:05:50.773 --> 01:05:53.939
We're looking for meds, for her.

602
01:05:54.022 --> 01:05:56.356
The clinics are running out of supplies.

603
01:05:57.398 --> 01:05:58.481
I got a couple doses.

604
01:05:58.564 --> 01:05:59.898
You can have 'em.

605
01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.314
They stopped working for
me a couple weeks ago.


606
01:06:03.272 --> 01:06:04.523
Where do you come from?

607
01:06:05.481 --> 01:06:06.314
Weyburn.

608
01:06:07.356 --> 01:06:08.272
Weyburn?

609
01:06:08.356 --> 01:06:09.689
How'd you get here?

610
01:06:09.773 --> 01:06:12.606
Joined up with a mining
crew a couple years ago.


611
01:06:12.689 --> 01:06:14.272
Worked in the hills.

612
01:06:14.356 --> 01:06:18.106
Then everything went to shit.

613
01:06:19.231 --> 01:06:20.856
I got caught in the middle of it.

614
01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:27.731
How did you become infected?

615
01:06:28.897 --> 01:06:30.314
When the fighting broke out,

616
01:06:30.398 --> 01:06:32.606
we got trapped in one of the tunnels.

617
01:06:34.064 --> 01:06:39.064
Scabs, they gassed us,
we all got infected.


618
01:06:40.815 --> 01:06:43.231
I started working odd
jobs for a few months,


619
01:06:43.314 --> 01:06:47.064
but once you start to look like this,

620
01:06:47.147 --> 01:06:49.815
people don't really
want you around anymore.


621
01:06:52.231 --> 01:06:53.690
How about you?

622
01:06:53.773 --> 01:06:54.648
How'd you get it?

623
01:06:55.815 --> 01:06:59.314
In my village, the
virus was in the water.


624
01:06:59.398 --> 01:07:00.773
We all drank it.

625
01:07:01.856 --> 01:07:04.189
You know, there's supposed to be a cure.

626
01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:07.022
Really, where?

627
01:07:07.939 --> 01:07:12.855
In Voskos country,
there's a city called Rama.


628
01:07:14.272 --> 01:07:18.272
Rama, I have heard of this place.

629
01:07:18.356 --> 01:07:20.523
That's where they cooked up the virus.

630
01:07:20.606 --> 01:07:22.314
They say that's where the cure is.

631
01:07:23.731 --> 01:07:25.731
Where'd you hear that?

632
01:07:25.815 --> 01:07:27.523
I don't know, it's just a rumor.

633
01:07:28.523 --> 01:07:31.231
Yeah, sounds like it.

634
01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:34.356
- But maybe it is true.
- Maybe.


635
01:07:36.231 --> 01:07:38.314
All right, I'm gonna get some sleep.

636
01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:40.481
You got the first watch?

637
01:07:51.272 --> 01:07:52.314
What you got there?

638
01:07:53.189 --> 01:07:54.398
It is just a picture.

639
01:07:59.897 --> 01:08:01.439
Are these your parents?

640
01:08:01.523 --> 01:08:03.897
No, I found it today, on a bogey.

641
01:08:07.897 --> 01:08:09.731
You can sleep, if you like.

642
01:08:09.814 --> 01:08:11.355
I will watch.

643
01:08:11.439 --> 01:08:12.273
Thanks.

644
01:08:37.648 --> 01:08:39.147
What's going on?

645
01:08:41.147 --> 01:08:42.480
Taylor.

646
01:08:42.565 --> 01:08:43.813
Taylor!

647
01:08:43.897 --> 01:08:47.439
Get back!

648
01:08:49.522 --> 01:08:51.398
- She is...
- She's turning.


649
01:08:56.147 --> 01:08:56.981
Help, help me!

650
01:08:59.314 --> 01:09:00.690
There's nothing we can do.

651
01:09:03.896 --> 01:09:04.731
Shoot her.

652
01:09:07.063 --> 01:09:07.896
Do it.

653
01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:14.480
Do it now, before she turns!

654
01:09:22.314 --> 01:09:23.064
Lex, now!

655
01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:29.063
Good.

656
01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.313
That sound's gonna attract more of them.

657
01:09:33.398 --> 01:09:34.481
We should keep moving.

658
01:09:42.939 --> 01:09:43.771
You okay?

659
01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:46.523
Duh.

660
01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:48.856
Then come on.

661
01:09:59.106 --> 01:10:01.606
- Hey, Cal?
- Yeah?


662
01:10:01.689 --> 01:10:03.939
You don't always have to yell at me.

663
01:10:04.022 --> 01:10:05.398
Lex, I never yell at you!

664
01:10:05.481 --> 01:10:07.106
Sometimes I say things that are important,

665
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:09.439
and I get a little louder, okay?

666
01:10:09.523 --> 01:10:11.273
It sounds like yelling to me.

667
01:10:11.356 --> 01:10:12.856
Yeah, well, it's not,

668
01:10:12.939 --> 01:10:14.398
- it's...
- It's yelling.


669
01:10:15.273 --> 01:10:16.148
What do you want me to say?

670
01:10:16.231 --> 01:10:17.064
I'm sorry?

671
01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.189
Well, I'm sorry.

672
01:10:19.273 --> 01:10:21.523
It's okay, I forgive you.

673
01:10:23.481 --> 01:10:24.730
Thanks.

674
01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:54.481
We should go.

675
01:11:55.356 --> 01:11:58.939
No, too many of us are sick.

676
01:11:59.022 --> 01:12:00.689
It's getting colder.

677
01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:01.731
We're searching for a signal

678
01:12:01.814 --> 01:12:03.314
that doesn't want to be found.

679
01:12:04.314 --> 01:12:05.148
Then leave.

680
01:12:06.023 --> 01:12:07.772
I'm not going home empty-handed.

681
01:13:09.356 --> 01:13:10.106
Maya!

682
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:11.023
Maya!

683
01:13:15.897 --> 01:13:16.647
Are you hurt?

684
01:13:16.731 --> 01:13:20.689
No, there's something stuck in my leg.

685
01:13:20.772 --> 01:13:22.814
Where is my gun?

686
01:13:22.897 --> 01:13:24.939
What do you mean where's your gun?

687
01:15:17.522 --> 01:15:18.356
We found it.

688
01:16:00.023 --> 01:16:00.939
You live here?

689
01:16:02.481 --> 01:16:03.315
By yourself?

690
01:16:05.606 --> 01:16:06.439
No.

691
01:16:09.522 --> 01:16:10.355
Leora,

692
01:16:13.314 --> 01:16:14.148
my daughter.

693
01:16:17.564 --> 01:16:18.481
Where is she?

694
01:16:43.647 --> 01:16:45.439
How long have you two been out here?

695
01:16:48.606 --> 01:16:49.814
Since the solar storm.

696
01:16:53.522 --> 01:16:54.814
Since the world went dark.

697
01:16:56.272 --> 01:16:58.564
Seven years, Jesus.

698
01:17:01.023 --> 01:17:01.856
How?

699
01:17:06.231 --> 01:17:07.065
Hey,

700
01:17:09.314 --> 01:17:14.148
chapstick, prevents infection.

701
01:17:35.856 --> 01:17:36.689
Change.

702
01:17:59.106 --> 01:18:01.272
Best restaurant of the trip, hands down.

703
01:18:17.522 --> 01:18:20.230
I can't believe that
thing actually works.


704
01:18:20.314 --> 01:18:23.981
Haven't seen one of those in years.

705
01:18:24.065 --> 01:18:26.481
We live east, 20 miles.

706
01:18:27.898 --> 01:18:29.397
A gated compound.

707
01:18:29.481 --> 01:18:30.773
Ever made it out that way?

708
01:18:32.898 --> 01:18:36.314
East, west, up, down,

709
01:18:38.106 --> 01:18:39.564
out there, it's all the same.

710
01:18:40.773 --> 01:18:42.356
There's about 50 of us.

711
01:18:42.439 --> 01:18:44.481
We work together to survive.

712
01:18:44.564 --> 01:18:47.606
It's safe, always room for one more.

713
01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:50.314
Leora likes it here.

714
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.856
Do you expect her back tonight?

715
01:18:58.272 --> 01:19:00.314
Okay I have to ask,

716
01:19:00.397 --> 01:19:02.230
how is it your generator still has juice

717
01:19:02.314 --> 01:19:04.481
in it after all these years?

718
01:19:04.564 --> 01:19:06.648
I mean, I thought all the
solar panels burnt out,


719
01:19:06.731 --> 01:19:08.314
during the storm.

720
01:19:08.397 --> 01:19:09.230
Hey,

721
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:13.940
you don't look happy.

722
01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:17.272
I want you to be happy.

723
01:19:19.981 --> 01:19:20.814
I'm happy.

724
01:19:22.272 --> 01:19:25.439
Happy that I'm at the best
restaurant of the trip.


725
01:19:28.648 --> 01:19:31.065
Look, don't worry, the lights stay on.

726
01:19:32.564 --> 01:19:34.397
We have a portable fusion generator.

727
01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:38.065
This is fusion energy?

728
01:19:40.856 --> 01:19:42.689
You could power a whole goddamn city.

729
01:19:44.023 --> 01:19:47.522
A city, at full capacity
for one 1,321 days.


730
01:19:51.898 --> 01:19:53.147
That was the idea anyway.

731
01:19:54.147 --> 01:19:56.814
How the hell did you get your
hands on a fusion generator?


732
01:19:58.397 --> 01:19:59.898
What was it that
took you 20 miles away,

733
01:19:59.981 --> 01:20:01.065
from all that safety?

734
01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:03.773
Hunting.

735
01:20:03.856 --> 01:20:05.898
We were running low on food.

736
01:20:05.981 --> 01:20:06.773
Well, if you're low on food,

737
01:20:06.856 --> 01:20:09.189
doesn't make much sense if
we joined you now, does it?


738
01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:11.731
No, we weren't meant to live like this.

739
01:20:11.814 --> 01:20:16.564
Maybe this is exactly
how we were meant to live.


740
01:20:16.648 --> 01:20:17.481
Which part?

741
01:20:19.105 --> 01:20:20.105
The riots?

742
01:20:21.064 --> 01:20:22.898
Chaos consuming humanity?

743
01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:24.356
Children dying in the darkness?

744
01:20:41.773 --> 01:20:43.898
We need to get back home and
tell Marcus and the others


745
01:20:43.981 --> 01:20:45.064
what we found.

746
01:20:49.356 --> 01:20:50.272
Maya, Maya.

747
01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:53.898
- Val, my leg is fucked!
- Wait...


748
01:20:56.564 --> 01:20:58.064
Sweetheart, don't tap the glass,

749
01:20:58.147 --> 01:21:00.314
you're gonna scare them.

750
01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:01.814
Listen to me,

751
01:21:01.898 --> 01:21:04.439
we're not leaving here
without his generator.


752
01:21:04.523 --> 01:21:07.064
This was just a recon run.

753
01:21:07.147 --> 01:21:08.439
Till it wasn't.

754
01:21:08.523 --> 01:21:10.648
Maya, Maya.

755
01:21:12.523 --> 01:21:13.356
He'll kill us.

756
01:21:17.815 --> 01:21:19.397
Not if we kill him first.

757
01:21:20.564 --> 01:21:21.564
Open your eyes.

758
01:21:22.731 --> 01:21:24.481
Does it look like a little girl...

759
01:21:41.481 --> 01:21:42.314
Don't leave.

760
01:21:44.022 --> 01:21:45.606
I'll make us some dandelion tea.

761
01:22:12.648 --> 01:22:14.773
Let the gun slide down your shoulder

762
01:22:14.856 --> 01:22:17.648
and onto the floor, nice and easy.

763
01:22:29.815 --> 01:22:30.648
Back up.

764
01:22:33.064 --> 01:22:34.481
Val, pick it up.

765
01:22:37.398 --> 01:22:39.564
Pick it up!

766
01:22:46.356 --> 01:22:47.523
Where's your generator?

767
01:22:49.773 --> 01:22:50.606
You lied to me.

768
01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:53.731
You woulda rushed us
out of here if I didn't.


769
01:22:53.815 --> 01:22:56.356
Sweetheart careful, don't tap the glass,

770
01:22:56.439 --> 01:22:57.648
you're gonna scare them.

771
01:22:58.564 --> 01:22:59.815
I don't know what you're doing,

772
01:22:59.898 --> 01:23:01.648
but say anything other than follow me

773
01:23:01.731 --> 01:23:04.356
and I blow your fucking
balls off, one at a time!


774
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:11.022
Follow me.

775
01:23:25.939 --> 01:23:27.481
My name is Isaac

776
01:23:27.564 --> 01:23:29.398
and I'm very happy to
have you here with me.


777
01:23:29.481 --> 01:23:32.189
I don't give a shit what
your name is, keep walking.


778
01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.106
What is this?

779
01:23:49.606 --> 01:23:52.231
I'm taking you to see Leora.

780
01:23:57.064 --> 01:24:00.314
Three years since our
last generator died.


781
01:24:00.398 --> 01:24:02.773
Three years living the dark.

782
01:24:03.773 --> 01:24:05.855
Praying to an empty godless sky.

783
01:24:07.439 --> 01:24:08.815
Praying we'd find a way out.

784
01:24:10.064 --> 01:24:12.147
Praying we'd find you.

785
01:24:15.523 --> 01:24:16.648
That's it.

786
01:24:16.731 --> 01:24:18.064
I'm quitting life.

787
01:24:18.147 --> 01:24:20.897
I'm gonna stay here with you
forever, this is paradise.


788
01:24:21.815 --> 01:24:22.773
Get on your knees.

789
01:24:22.855 --> 01:24:23.690
Maya,

790
01:24:25.564 --> 01:24:27.231
no one needs to die here today.

791
01:24:28.773 --> 01:24:31.731
Sometimes, someone needs to die.

792
01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:51.814
Thank you.

793
01:24:57.855 --> 01:24:58.939
Maya, Maya.

794
01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:09.273
I'm so sorry.

795
01:25:18.731 --> 01:25:20.523
Don't keep Leora waiting.

796
01:26:11.897 --> 01:26:13.814
Beautiful, isn't she?

797
01:26:17.814 --> 01:26:21.022
Can you imagine
waking up to this everyday?


798
01:26:21.106 --> 01:26:23.690
I'm staying here with you forever.

799
01:26:27.606 --> 01:26:29.106
Sweetheart,
careful, don't tap the glass.


800
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:30.314
You're gonna scare them.

801
01:26:32.022 --> 01:26:34.231
Can you imagine waking
up to this every day?


802
01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:37.064
God, this place is incredible.

803
01:26:37.147 --> 01:26:40.606
That's it, I'm staying
here with you now forever.


804
01:26:40.689 --> 01:26:42.439
You're stuck with me.

805
01:26:42.523 --> 01:26:44.689
This place is paradise.

806
01:26:45.939 --> 01:26:48.814
Can you imagine waking
up to this every day?


807
01:26:48.897 --> 01:26:51.481
God, this place is incredible.

808
01:26:51.565 --> 01:26:55.814
That's it, I'm staying
here with you now forever.


809
01:26:55.897 --> 01:26:57.648
You're stuck with me.

810
01:26:59.148 --> 01:26:59.981
Please,

811
01:27:03.481 --> 01:27:04.314
let me go.

812
01:27:18.606 --> 01:27:23.189
Tell me you're having so much fun here.

813
01:27:27.689 --> 01:27:29.273
I'm having so much fun here.

814
01:27:31.314 --> 01:27:33.231
No, you didn't mean that.

815
01:27:37.523 --> 01:27:39.273
You didn't mean that.

816
01:27:40.606 --> 01:27:42.939
Mean what you say!

817
01:27:48.772 --> 01:27:50.481
I'm having so much fun here.

818
01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.772
It was a beautiful day.

819
01:27:55.981 --> 01:27:57.022
We went for a walk.

820
01:27:59.565 --> 01:28:00.689
Just goddamn it!

821
01:28:00.772 --> 01:28:03.481
Just, please, just let me go!

822
01:28:03.565 --> 01:28:08.314
Tell me you wanna quit your
life and stay here with me.


823
01:28:13.689 --> 01:28:14.523
No,

824
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:19.273
you could help people.

825
01:28:21.605 --> 01:28:23.647
You're sitting on fusion energy.

826
01:28:25.231 --> 01:28:26.981
You could rebuild this world.

827
01:28:29.356 --> 01:28:31.565
But instead you just, you hide.

828
01:28:33.647 --> 01:28:35.605
You hide in here behind a screen.

829
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:36.731
You're pathetic.

830
01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:40.564
No different from how all of you acted,

831
01:28:40.647 --> 01:28:42.605
before the world went to shit.

832
01:28:44.939 --> 01:28:49.523
So you don't get to judge me.

833
01:28:51.856 --> 01:28:52.731
You live out there in the dark

834
01:28:52.814 --> 01:28:55.814
but you don't know what
real darkness looks like.


835
01:29:00.814 --> 01:29:02.148
Where's Leora?

836
01:29:06.647 --> 01:29:08.356
The real Leora.

837
01:29:11.981 --> 01:29:12.897
How'd she die?

838
01:29:14.939 --> 01:29:15.856
She get sick?

839
01:29:18.023 --> 01:29:20.356
She go out on a food
run and never come back?


840
01:29:22.814 --> 01:29:24.231
Did she die here?

841
01:29:27.106 --> 01:29:29.273
She died here, didn't she?

842
01:29:30.939 --> 01:29:31.939
She killed herself?

843
01:29:35.356 --> 01:29:36.772
She killed herself, didn't she?

844
01:29:40.106 --> 01:29:41.356
Please, my son.

845
01:29:43.231 --> 01:29:45.647
My son Ethan was two during the riots.

846
01:29:45.731 --> 01:29:48.231
They shot him in his leg.

847
01:29:49.315 --> 01:29:52.356
He bled out right in my arms
and he just, he held my hand.


848
01:29:53.647 --> 01:29:56.481
He held my hand and he had
the softest little hands.


849
01:29:56.564 --> 01:29:58.564
And he was always happy.

850
01:30:00.106 --> 01:30:02.939
He was always happy, even in the end.

851
01:30:05.023 --> 01:30:06.689
He was always happy.

852
01:31:24.315 --> 01:31:27.148
Leora, she was the one who...

853
01:31:34.772 --> 01:31:35.606
Wait!

854
01:31:38.898 --> 01:31:39.731
Wait,

855
01:31:42.315 --> 01:31:43.148
wait.

856
01:31:50.856 --> 01:31:53.939
You don't wanna end up like your son.

857
01:31:55.106 --> 01:31:56.689
I don't have a son.

858
01:31:57.814 --> 01:31:59.064
I made all that up.

859
01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:39.600
