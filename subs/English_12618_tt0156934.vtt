1
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.919
555-01-36.

2
00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.716
If you check in, I'm heading for
the airport early. Meet me for coffee.


3
00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:43.082
They're gonna mark you tardy.

4
00:01:43.382 --> 00:01:44.841
I've got court today.

5
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:46.460
You working late?

6
00:01:48.513 --> 00:01:49.628
I can if you are.

7
00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.047
Thought I'd take you to The Palm.

8
00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:56.103
I wanna get my dad
one of those weather radios.


9
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.813
The nothing-but-weather ones.
Now that he's on the water.


10
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.147
Get him a book.
Let him dope it out. He'd like that.


11
00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:05.314
You'd like that.

12
00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:08.779
He doesn't think the weatherman
will lie to him.


13
00:02:09.077 --> 00:02:11.484
He wants to know
if a hurricane's coming.


14
00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:13.370
What's wrong with The Palm?

15
00:02:15.123 --> 00:02:17.201
It's Friday night. 
It'll be crowded.

16
00:02:17.877 --> 00:02:19.751
You like it crowded.

17
00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:22.045
Okay, let's go to The Palm.

18
00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:48.106
If you're just killing time...

19
00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:55.702
Help!

20
00:02:58.001 --> 00:02:59.709
Did he talk about God?

21
00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:02.372
Ask him if God said anything bad.

22
00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:05.466
If we get him to say
God speaks to him, then--


23
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:06.999
That thing's cordless.

24
00:03:07.344 --> 00:03:08.802
What else did he say?

25
00:03:09.137 --> 00:03:09.921
Oh, baloney.

26
00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.972
She's on the phone.
She'll be right down.


27
00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:15.467
What's he know about
the democratic process?


28
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.091
I gotta go.

29
00:03:18.273 --> 00:03:19.648
Got any cash?

30
00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:20.681
Sure.

31
00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:22.733
I need about a half a million.

32
00:03:24.444 --> 00:03:28.313
Harold Cornelius is gonna run
against me as a write-in.


33
00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:29.523
He's a nutcase.

34
00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:32.316
With a chain of drugstores
and a lot of money.


35
00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:34.330
- Where are you going?
- New York.


36
00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:37.950
New Hampshire won't stand for him
buying a seat in Congress.


37
00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.158
He's Elmer Fudd.

38
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.660
Yeah, sure.

39
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:43.542
Jessie's birthday's Wednesday.
I said we'd both be home.


40
00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.299
Sure.

41
00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:06.395
Attention.

42
00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:10.355
Convective Sigma 3 Echo in effect
for Washington-Baltimore area.


43
00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.195
A line of thunderstorms
approximately 60 miles wide...


44
00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:19.284
...moving from 260 degrees at 15 knots
with tops to flight level 350.


45
00:04:19.628 --> 00:04:22.794
Wind gusts to 60 knots and possible
cloud-to-cloud lightning.


46
00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.496
Visibility occasionally one mile...

47
00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:36.643
I said I wouldn't take PAC money.

48
00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:39.682
- That's when we didn't need it.
- What do I say now?


49
00:04:40.064 --> 00:04:42.687
Do you swear to tell the truth?

50
00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:44.016
I do.

51
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:48.063
Name and occupation for the jury.

52
00:04:48.364 --> 00:04:51.236
William Van Den Broeck.
Sergeant in Internal Affairs...


53
00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:53.901
...of the District of Columbia
Police Department.


54
00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:56.196
And what's your job, sergeant?

55
00:04:56.456 --> 00:05:01.035
Internal Affairs investigates incidents
or allegations of misconduct...


56
00:05:01.337 --> 00:05:05.715
... involving sworn officers and
employees of the District of Columbia.


57
00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:23.774
Miami boarding at gate 33.

58
00:05:24.027 --> 00:05:26.102
He thinks we'll let him
get away with that?


59
00:05:27.363 --> 00:05:28.942
Depose Henry.

60
00:05:29.408 --> 00:05:30.818
Sure.

61
00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:32.695
I'll see you.

62
00:05:34.537 --> 00:05:35.321
Sergeant...

63
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:36.696
...Van Den Broeck...

64
00:05:37.082 --> 00:05:40.616
...you had to take a test
to make sergeant, didn't you?


65
00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:42.324
It was a written exam.

66
00:05:42.587 --> 00:05:44.830
If I put into evidence
records showing...


67
00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:47.457
...56 officers took
the test same time as you...


68
00:05:47.718 --> 00:05:51.170
...and you did better than 54 of them,
would that be about right?


69
00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:54.007
- We could look it up.
- The point is...


70
00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:55.677
...you're a smart guy.

71
00:05:55.934 --> 00:05:58.687
Number two on the written,

72
00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:00.598
How come you're not a lieutenant?

73
00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:02.315
Where are we going with this?

74
00:06:02.608 --> 00:06:03.722
Is it because you're white?

75
00:06:03.984 --> 00:06:06.025
She cannot do that! Your Honour!

76
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.409
From 11 News,
this is a special report.


77
00:06:27.383 --> 00:06:28.581
May I help you?

78
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:31.752
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.

79
00:06:32.014 --> 00:06:36.011
Is there a radio just for weather?
It's for my father-in-law in Florida.


80
00:06:36.267 --> 00:06:38.345
I got a couple back here.
I'll show you.


81
00:06:40.564 --> 00:06:43.398
A normal crew is two pilots
and three attendants.


82
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.894
The aircraft involved was a 73 7...

83
00:06:46.154 --> 00:06:49.853
... which normally is configured
for seats for 96 to 138 passengers.


84
00:06:50.115 --> 00:06:52.193
- Where's this?
- Down in the bay.


85
00:06:52.494 --> 00:06:56.111
National Safety Board officials
were en route to the site...


86
00:07:13.806 --> 00:07:15.883
--over Chesapeake Bay,

87
00:07:16.226 --> 00:07:18.931
... of the city limits,
where Southern Airlines flight...


88
00:07:19.187 --> 00:07:22.472
...437 to Miami went down
about an hour ago...


89
00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:24.014
... with 103 passengers...

90
00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:25.942
Anything happening?

91
00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:29.528
School cops took a nine
out of this girl's locker.


92
00:07:29.822 --> 00:07:33.358
Same gun got logged into evidence
six weeks ago. Drive-by weapon.


93
00:07:35.078 --> 00:07:39.575
--8000 feet when it veered off-course
and began a steep descent--


94
00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.241
The only thing he isn't short on
is cash.


95
00:07:42.544 --> 00:07:45.165
He'll buy a million dollars
worth of TV time...


96
00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:48.258
...and hide behind the best advertising
money can buy.


97
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:51.636
I can beat him if I can get
on television myself.


98
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:57.684
The issue here is whether someone
totally unsuited for public office...


99
00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.012
...can buy his way into
the United States Congress.


100
00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:02.850
I hope your answer's no.

101
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.308
I said "buy" too many times, right?

102
00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:08.351
Let's eat.

103
00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.201
You got no lunchroom here?

104
00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.084
Here's what we got.

105
00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:28.623
We got a gun that was used
in a homicide. Killed someone.


106
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:33.304
It got stolen out of the property room.
Maybe some cop sold it right out.


107
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:36.515
Then we got you
in possession of that gun.


108
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.891
We ain't got no lunchroom.

109
00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:41.850
Some school fool say he found
some gun in my locker.


110
00:08:42.106 --> 00:08:45.142
I wouldn't know. I wasn't there.
I ain't possessing nothing.


111
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.894
How did it get in your locker, Shyla?

112
00:08:48.446 --> 00:08:51.115
Don't use my Christian name
like we'll be friends.


113
00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:54.733
It's my impression you weren't
in the market for corporate support.


114
00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:56.619
I hate making these calls.

115
00:08:56.871 --> 00:08:59.540
I thought I wouldn't have to.
But now I need the money.


116
00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:01.748
We had good relations with your dad.

117
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.702
He understood the communications
business. We appreciated that.


118
00:09:05.964 --> 00:09:07.162
Who was doing your media?

119
00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:09.340
I guess I was.

120
00:09:09.592 --> 00:09:12.345
Never needed much till Cornelius
came out of left field.


121
00:09:12.596 --> 00:09:13.627
Make that right field.

122
00:09:14.931 --> 00:09:16.473
What do you think of Carl Broman?

123
00:09:17.977 --> 00:09:21.226
--offshore breeze and clearing.
Low tonight in the mid-70s.


124
00:09:23.398 --> 00:09:26.069
Juvenile's got her brother
for knocking over gas stations.


125
00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:28.146
I guess she's holding for him...

126
00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.904
...but she won't talk to us.

127
00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:32.478
We can get her detention.

128
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.367
Oh, yeah? How?

129
00:09:34.619 --> 00:09:36.492
I'll lose her paperwork.

130
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:39.195
You'd do that?
Hold her without a charge?


131
00:09:39.623 --> 00:09:42.874
For a week. If she wants
to go home, maybe we get a name.


132
00:09:43.252 --> 00:09:44.995
Dutch, line three.

133
00:09:48.215 --> 00:09:49.414
Van Den Broeck.

134
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.049
Clayton? And George Beaufort?

135
00:09:52.762 --> 00:09:54.671
Well, Friday's payday, I guess.

136
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.890
Stick with him till we catch up.

137
00:09:57.142 --> 00:10:00.095
I want this son of a bitch.
Alcee, we're on the roll.


138
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:01.802
Janice...

139
00:10:02.313 --> 00:10:04.556
I didn't do anything.
We were just talking.


140
00:10:04.858 --> 00:10:08.392
Don't even think that way.
Shit like that makes people hate cops.


141
00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:09.685
Grab a radio.

142
00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:10.769
Cassie?

143
00:10:11.447 --> 00:10:12.907
You got a car for me?

144
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:17.192
Not the pimpmobile.
It's surveillance, not narcotics.


145
00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:18.485
This is it.

146
00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:23.458
Your wife called.
She said things came up at work.


147
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.952
She can't eat with you
and you should call.


148
00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:29.464
You can see the tail
is sticking out of the water.


149
00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:31.916
You can hear choppers above me.

150
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.753
News choppers are getting
a better look.


151
00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:36.467
Search and rescue operations--

152
00:10:36.724 --> 00:10:40.721
--about an hour ago, with a reported

153
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:44.016
That aeroplane, a 12-year-old 737...

154
00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:51.697
There's Clayton.

155
00:10:53.825 --> 00:10:55.733
What the hell's he doing?

156
00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:00.163
- What's this clown doing?
- I don't know.


157
00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:04.125
And where's George?

158
00:11:09.174 --> 00:11:12.044
- Wait a minute.
- Get Elton and Tommy back here quick.


159
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.421
Tommy, we need you guys back here.
Something's going down.


160
00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.597
Clayton?

161
00:11:27.859 --> 00:11:30.102
How you doing? 
What's going on?

162
00:11:31.322 --> 00:11:33.195
Where's George, your partner?

163
00:11:34.032 --> 00:11:34.981
In the basement.

164
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.732
The basement?

165
00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:39.329
What's he doing in there?

166
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.665
A guy named Marvin is pouring booze
without a license.


167
00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.960
We're getting ready to write him.
He comes up with a shotgun.


168
00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:47.623
He says he wants money.

169
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.208
He tells me to get it.

170
00:11:49.548 --> 00:11:50.663
He's got George.

171
00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:53.710
Somebody's holding
George Beaufort hostage.


172
00:11:54.888 --> 00:11:56.512
Can he send us an ear?

173
00:11:56.764 --> 00:11:58.306
What's the plan, officer?

174
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.466
We could call police.

175
00:12:01.228 --> 00:12:03.137
Is that what you're
getting ready to do?


176
00:12:03.396 --> 00:12:05.721
Call the police?
There's a lot here already.


177
00:12:06.232 --> 00:12:08.902
He's got a gun on George.
We gotta do something.


178
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.318
See, we're Internal Affairs.

179
00:12:14.115 --> 00:12:16.026
You got a policeman that screws up.

180
00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:19.369
You got a policeman
that abuses his position, steals.


181
00:12:19.663 --> 00:12:21.038
That's us.

182
00:12:21.498 --> 00:12:23.159
What do you think is going on?

183
00:12:23.418 --> 00:12:25.326
You think we just happened by?

184
00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:28.118
We've been on you all day. All week.

185
00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:30.422
We've been on you all month.

186
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.998
You know what I think?

187
00:12:32.427 --> 00:12:34.834
Somebody got sick
and tired of paying you off.


188
00:12:35.137 --> 00:12:37.546
You wanna corroborate that,
gives us a reason...


189
00:12:37.808 --> 00:12:40.132
...to drag George's ass
out of the basement.


190
00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:43.310
Or we'll talk to the guy
with the gun, hear his version.


191
00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:46.014
You're asking me to turn George in?

192
00:12:47.526 --> 00:12:49.683
Just push me and push me...

193
00:12:56.993 --> 00:12:58.108
Marvin?

194
00:12:59.036 --> 00:13:00.317
I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck.

195
00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:05.408
Hello, asshole. 
You're under arrest.

196
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.290
Who is the real Kay Chandler?
What's she stand for?


197
00:13:11.633 --> 00:13:12.748
Do you know?

198
00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:15.458
What's she doing in Congress anyway?

199
00:13:18.682 --> 00:13:20.390
Harold Cornelius for Congress.

200
00:13:22.894 --> 00:13:24.604
Shirley Magnuson did it.

201
00:13:25.023 --> 00:13:27.181
- Pretty good.
- You think so?


202
00:13:27.817 --> 00:13:31.068
She knows you're running
as Arthur Spencer's daughter.


203
00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:34.275
Poor guy's dead, and when he wasn't,
he got a lot of votes.


204
00:13:34.532 --> 00:13:37.153
So all she does is ask
a couple of questions.


205
00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:40.779
The subtext is "She only
got elected because of her daddy."


206
00:13:41.122 --> 00:13:43.695
She didn't earn it.
This is America. That ain't fair.


207
00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.450
I'm not running
as Arthur Spencer's daughter.


208
00:13:46.712 --> 00:13:48.669
What will you run as? Nice person?

209
00:13:48.964 --> 00:13:50.162
I have my own record.

210
00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:54.718
City attorney?
"National committeewoman"?


211
00:13:55.012 --> 00:13:57.585
A record's when somebody
remembers what you did.


212
00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:00.214
I beat Harvey Galin five to three.

213
00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:01.507
My, my.

214
00:14:01.853 --> 00:14:03.395
Five to three.

215
00:14:03.771 --> 00:14:06.440
How'd those three vote Democratic
in a district that hadn't...


216
00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:10.267
...voted for a Democrat since
Roosevelt? They're sending a message.


217
00:14:10.653 --> 00:14:12.444
This won't be a nice election.

218
00:14:12.738 --> 00:14:16.189
Folks talking about
the amber waves of grain.


219
00:14:16.866 --> 00:14:19.785
It's about the man's money
against the woman's name.


220
00:14:20.037 --> 00:14:22.362
Can't beat you on your record.
You have none.


221
00:14:22.623 --> 00:14:24.081
He won't beat you on the issues.

222
00:14:24.374 --> 00:14:26.202
On the issues, 
I'll kick his ass.

223
00:14:26.503 --> 00:14:28.744
The question is,
can you beat Shirley Magnuson?


224
00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:31.288
I'm not running against
Shirley Magnuson.


225
00:14:31.673 --> 00:14:33.549
What you don't want in the papers...

226
00:14:33.802 --> 00:14:36.471
...what you haven't told your husband,
she'll find it.


227
00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:40.382
Shirley's wasting her time.

228
00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:41.925
How's your marriage?

229
00:14:42.561 --> 00:14:44.304
Swell. How's yours?

230
00:14:45.688 --> 00:14:48.774
If I was running for office,
I'd be in trouble.


231
00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:53.401
You fool around, Mrs. Chandler?
A little slap and tickle?


232
00:14:55.658 --> 00:14:57.318
Any special friends?

233
00:14:58.702 --> 00:15:00.860
Not at the moment,
but I'll keep you posted.


234
00:15:01.955 --> 00:15:03.581
What's the worst thing
you've done?


235
00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:05.991
You need a life, Mr. Broman.

236
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:12.840
For a moment, I thought we wouldn't
have any fun at all.


237
00:15:16.928 --> 00:15:19.172
I didn't take a dime from you,
you bastard.


238
00:15:24.019 --> 00:15:25.394
Marvin...

239
00:15:26.021 --> 00:15:28.809
We don't come up soon,
they'll come and get us.


240
00:15:29.067 --> 00:15:31.640
What you think they'd do about me?

241
00:15:31.944 --> 00:15:34.697
You'll pay a fine for pouring liquor
without a license...


242
00:15:35.073 --> 00:15:37.231
...but I need you to testify
against George.


243
00:15:37.492 --> 00:15:39.401
You got some leverage.

244
00:15:42.998 --> 00:15:44.622
Wanna make your situation worse?

245
00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:47.992
Just keep thinking
what you're thinking.


246
00:15:57.221 --> 00:16:00.839
You pay a little fine,
plead to disorderly.


247
00:16:01.141 --> 00:16:04.141
But you gotta promise
you'll show up against George.


248
00:16:07.356 --> 00:16:09.395
I gotta have that shotgun.

249
00:16:09.942 --> 00:16:11.056
Now.

250
00:16:14.947 --> 00:16:17.272
Good man. Go on up.

251
00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:24.239
Alcee, Marvin's coming up.

252
00:16:24.498 --> 00:16:27.584
Get him downtown.
Take real good care of him, okay?


253
00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:33.380
Were you really gonna shoot him?

254
00:16:34.258 --> 00:16:36.667
He had that shotgun
pointed right at me.


255
00:16:37.262 --> 00:16:39.171
What would you do about me?

256
00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:41.923
I figured he'd shoot you.

257
00:16:42.349 --> 00:16:44.593
And I'd shoot him, get myself a medal.

258
00:16:46.813 --> 00:16:48.272
You'd be dead, of course.

259
00:16:49.857 --> 00:16:52.646
You got a right
to remain silent, officer.


260
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.185
Use it.

261
00:17:14.593 --> 00:17:18.636
--95 passengers and crew members
are now feared lost.


262
00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:21.676
Navy divers were expected
to work throughout the night.


263
00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:23.475
Will Thomas, are you there?

264
00:17:23.768 --> 00:17:27.848
They already have a crane trying
to hoist the plane out of the water.


265
00:17:28.105 --> 00:17:29.601
We've got divers.

266
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.266
Where's Peyton?

267
00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:33.016
Working late.

268
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.776
You gonna eat?
We've got bay scallops.


269
00:17:39.076 --> 00:17:40.735
See if I can find her.

270
00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:43.319
--the plane struck the surface
at an angle...


271
00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:47.744
...and bounced at least one time before
plowing into the water nose first.


272
00:17:49.294 --> 00:17:51.784
I'm at Billy's. 
I'll call you at home.

273
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.090
If we don't catch up, I'll eat here.
He's got scallops.


274
00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:56.622
Love you. Bye.

275
00:18:05.602 --> 00:18:08.889
It's the Van Den Broecks.
Leave a message. We'll call you back.


276
00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:12.685
To play back your messages, press one.

277
00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:15.612
Hi, I'm at the airport.

278
00:18:15.864 --> 00:18:19.315
I send a catalogue to Miami without me,
and it's falling apart.:


279
00:18:19.617 --> 00:18:22.821
A new stylist, locations don't work,
bugs biting the girls...


280
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.989
...and you don't wanna know what else.

281
00:18:25.248 --> 00:18:29.115
Therefore, I'm on the plane
to kill critters and counsel careers.


282
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.079
I'll try to get back tomorrow,
but it may not be till Sunday.


283
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.009
God knows where I'll sleep.
They're in the Keys.


284
00:18:36.259 --> 00:18:38.502
I'll call you when I can.

285
00:18:39.889 --> 00:18:41.797
I had fun this morning.

286
00:18:43.183 --> 00:18:44.558
I love you.

287
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.395
You find her?

288
00:18:56.655 --> 00:18:59.360
No. That plane was going to Miami,
wasn't it?


289
00:18:59.658 --> 00:19:01.451
Give me some quarters.

290
00:19:03.162 --> 00:19:04.989
I once got laid in Miami.

291
00:19:10.212 --> 00:19:11.587
My name's Van Den Broeck.

292
00:19:11.838 --> 00:19:14.079
I'm a police officer,
if that makes any difference.


293
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:17.917
I know you get a lot of crazies
when something like this happens.


294
00:19:19.054 --> 00:19:22.338
I think it's possible my wife
may have been on your plane.


295
00:19:22.598 --> 00:19:24.758
Peyton Van Den Broeck.

296
00:19:30.523 --> 00:19:34.652
Great. Boy. She must be on another
flight. Boy, that'll wake you up.


297
00:19:34.945 --> 00:19:37.020
What are the other flights to Miami?

298
00:19:37.322 --> 00:19:39.648
Check the 1 : 15,
but it doesn't make sense.


299
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:41.901
She left for the airport after 9.

300
00:20:03.308 --> 00:20:06.143
Excuse me. I'm Bill Van Den Broeck,
Peyton's husband.


301
00:20:06.435 --> 00:20:09.886
She went to Miami today.
I need to know what plane she was on.


302
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:12.817
I can be with
you in just one moment.

303
00:20:13.068 --> 00:20:15.688
We don't have this in a six,
but I can order it.


304
00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:21.236
I'm Bill Van Den Broeck,
Peyton's husband.


305
00:20:21.493 --> 00:20:24.066
She went to Miami.
I need to know what plane she was on.


306
00:20:24.328 --> 00:20:26.204
- You're the policeman?
- Right.


307
00:20:26.457 --> 00:20:30.917
Mary Claire Clark books the travel,
but she goes home at 5:30.


308
00:20:31.211 --> 00:20:32.788
Can you reach her at home?

309
00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:35.212
Oh, my God! The plane that crashed.

310
00:20:35.966 --> 00:20:38.919
She was going to Miami,
but they don't have her listed.


311
00:20:40.136 --> 00:20:42.807
How do we get ahold
of Mary Claire Clark?


312
00:20:46.393 --> 00:20:47.341
Do we have to shout?

313
00:20:47.644 --> 00:20:50.848
Peyton went to Miami.
She might be on the plane that crashed.


314
00:20:51.107 --> 00:20:53.597
We have to find out
what flight she was on.


315
00:20:55.277 --> 00:20:58.113
Does anyone know what
Mary Claire Clark was doing tonight?


316
00:20:58.364 --> 00:21:00.155
Call the switchboard.
Get her number.


317
00:21:00.449 --> 00:21:01.729
The airline won't tell you?

318
00:21:01.992 --> 00:21:05.160
She's not listed,
but she's not listed on any flight.


319
00:21:06.081 --> 00:21:08.997
I know she was going.
She left messages at work and home.


320
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.325
They can't give out home numbers.

321
00:21:14.631 --> 00:21:16.208
This is Molly Roll. Who's this?

322
00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:19.927
I need your help. I'm the supervisor
in Designer Wear...


323
00:21:20.221 --> 00:21:24.348
...and you'll confirm that when you
call me back at extension 293, okay?


324
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:27.726
I need the home telephone number
of Mary Claire Clark.


325
00:21:28.312 --> 00:21:30.388
She's the department secretary.

326
00:21:30.647 --> 00:21:33.517
We are managing an emergency.
Do you understand?


327
00:21:33.816 --> 00:21:34.849
Thank you.

328
00:21:35.862 --> 00:21:38.019
You must be Dutch. I'm Molly.

329
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.024
What was she doing in Miami?

330
00:21:40.407 --> 00:21:42.484
It sounded like some kind of crisis.

331
00:21:42.786 --> 00:21:46.236
You're shooting a catalogue in the Keys
that was falling apart?


332
00:21:46.664 --> 00:21:48.739
What would we be shooting in the Keys?

333
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.999
Did she say which catalogue?

334
00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:52.159
Molly Roll.

335
00:21:56.423 --> 00:21:57.623
Thank you.

336
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.253
Sarah, would you get her for me?

337
00:22:00.803 --> 00:22:01.834
I'll get my boss.

338
00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:05.683
What catalogue are we shooting?

339
00:22:06.435 --> 00:22:08.759
I didn't know we were doing a catalogue.

340
00:22:09.854 --> 00:22:11.893
Susan, are you working?

341
00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:15.395
- Peyton didn't know she was going.
- There's no answer.


342
00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:18.062
Somebody must've called her.

343
00:22:18.321 --> 00:22:21.323
Would she call Mary Claire
for a reservation or would she...


344
00:22:21.575 --> 00:22:22.773
...use a travel agent?

345
00:22:24.828 --> 00:22:28.198
This is Mr. Driker, vice president
of Designer Wear. He's our boss.


346
00:22:28.499 --> 00:22:31.250
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Sure.


347
00:22:31.502 --> 00:22:34.253
Molly says Peyton may be
on the plane that crashed.


348
00:22:34.504 --> 00:22:36.297
- Is Peyton on that plane?
- We don't know.


349
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:39.040
- Either way, she's toast.
- Can you zip it?


350
00:22:39.343 --> 00:22:43.043
We don't have a catalogue shooting
in Florida or anywhere else.


351
00:22:43.346 --> 00:22:45.839
The next catalogue's not till Christmas.

352
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.057
Maybe it's not a catalogue.

353
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.182
Something with models.
The girls were bit by bugs.


354
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:55.433
No, there's nothing like that.

355
00:22:57.152 --> 00:23:00.523
If Peyton's travelling,
I don't think it's for the store.


356
00:23:00.824 --> 00:23:05.034
I know when people are out of town.
I approve it, and we're stingy on travel.


357
00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:09.532
Are you saying she lied to me?

358
00:23:12.376 --> 00:23:14.536
I'm saying I don't know where she is.

359
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.630
I'm thinking of something I can do.
I'd like to be helpful.


360
00:23:58.174 --> 00:24:00.215
There was this judge who had...

361
00:24:00.469 --> 00:24:04.929
...two whole entire families, kids,
dogs, everything. A judge.


362
00:24:05.223 --> 00:24:07.381
We think we know. 
We don't know.

363
00:24:07.725 --> 00:24:09.885
Nobody knows. You just don't know.

364
00:24:10.187 --> 00:24:11.562
Oh, my God.

365
00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:19.026
Maybe she travelled as someone's wife.
If anyone knows what his name is...


366
00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:20.939
...I could check that way.

367
00:24:24.744 --> 00:24:26.570
I don't know. Honestly.

368
00:24:30.959 --> 00:24:33.449
Beats me. She seemed...

369
00:24:33.753 --> 00:24:37.370
I mean, she never looked
like she was looking.


370
00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:43.919
Like girls look
if they're looking, okay?


371
00:24:47.726 --> 00:24:49.552
Mr. Van Den Broeck...

372
00:24:51.896 --> 00:24:54.768
...I think I know Peyton
as well as anyone here.


373
00:24:55.234 --> 00:24:56.348
I've got no idea.

374
00:24:57.152 --> 00:24:58.562
Are you surprised?

375
00:25:02.074 --> 00:25:05.608
The important thing is we don't know
if she was on the plane.


376
00:25:07.078 --> 00:25:08.536
I think she was on the plane.

377
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:41.311
Jessie, tell me the truth.
Are kids drinking at these parties?


378
00:25:43.783 --> 00:25:46.534
I invented some of the excuses
you're giving me.


379
00:25:46.785 --> 00:25:50.238
I've been 15. You've never been 35.

380
00:25:50.915 --> 00:25:52.290
Okay, okay, 37.

381
00:25:53.125 --> 00:25:55.082
I'll see for myself Wednesday.

382
00:25:57.089 --> 00:25:58.547
5'6."

383
00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:00.841
120.

384
00:26:01.801 --> 00:26:03.083
Blue eyes.

385
00:26:04.013 --> 00:26:06.088
A wedding band, just plain.

386
00:26:07.057 --> 00:26:10.507
A diamond ring, emerald-cut,
about a carat.


387
00:26:17.692 --> 00:26:21.062
I'm telling you, she was on your plane.
If I'm wrong, great!


388
00:26:21.363 --> 00:26:23.771
If I'm right, you know
who to call, okay?


389
00:27:00.153 --> 00:27:01.564
Got some empty boxes?

390
00:27:01.821 --> 00:27:03.813
Ask the guy out back.

391
00:27:20.842 --> 00:27:21.624
Excuse me.

392
00:27:21.884 --> 00:27:23.462
Are you Mr. Van Den Broeck?

393
00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:27.170
I'm David Dotson. This is
Phyllis Bonaparte. Southern Airlines.


394
00:27:27.474 --> 00:27:29.881
- Do you have a minute to talk to us?
- Sure.


395
00:27:37.609 --> 00:27:38.557
Mr. Van Den Broeck...

396
00:27:39.152 --> 00:27:43.020
...we don't show your wife as anybody's
passenger on any flight to Miami.


397
00:27:46.701 --> 00:27:48.492
Hi, I'm at the airport.

398
00:27:48.786 --> 00:27:51.788
I send a catalogue to Miami without me,
and it's falling apart.:


399
00:27:52.082 --> 00:27:55.700
A new stylist, locations don't work,
bugs biting the girls...


400
00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.120
...and you don't wanna know what else.

401
00:27:58.422 --> 00:28:00.747
Therefore, I'm on the plane to kill--

402
00:28:04.219 --> 00:28:08.087
No one named Van Den Broeck reserved
or bought a ticket to Miami.


403
00:28:09.558 --> 00:28:12.262
There is no catalogue shoot.
She works for Saks.


404
00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:14.228
They don't know where she is.

405
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.931
I think she was gonna spend the weekend
in Miami with another guy.


406
00:28:23.781 --> 00:28:28.407
If she was, would she tell
the truth about her destination?


407
00:28:28.871 --> 00:28:32.155
Trick is not to lie more than you
have to. Got a passenger list?


408
00:28:32.582 --> 00:28:34.159
I can't let you see it.

409
00:28:35.417 --> 00:28:37.661
I figure he bought the tickets
"Mr. and Mrs."


410
00:28:37.963 --> 00:28:41.129
I think he's married. Be interesting
when you call his house.


411
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.009
- I'm not allowed--
- Let him see the list.


412
00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:01.022
- I need that back.
- They'll give you another one.


413
00:29:01.529 --> 00:29:04.315
A Royal Regency Hotel is
near where the plane went down.


414
00:29:04.573 --> 00:29:06.481
We have rooms there
for family members.


415
00:29:07.075 --> 00:29:10.326
Why don't you drive down with us?
You'll have to identify--


416
00:29:11.455 --> 00:29:12.865
To make the identification.

417
00:29:13.665 --> 00:29:17.664
Sit around with the next of kin?
I got a lot of things to do.


418
00:29:18.379 --> 00:29:21.130
I don't think you should be
alone right now.


419
00:29:23.593 --> 00:29:25.632
I was alone before you got here.

420
00:29:36.689 --> 00:29:38.766
Everybody, listen up. Listen up.

421
00:29:39.109 --> 00:29:41.101
A guy thinks his wife was on 437...

422
00:29:41.361 --> 00:29:43.768
...travelling with a man
on Mr.-and-Mrs. tickets.


423
00:29:44.071 --> 00:29:46.398
He's a cop, so as far as we know,
he's not nuts.


424
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.736
Who the wife's boyfriend is,
he hasn't got a clue.


425
00:29:49.995 --> 00:29:54.076
We got nine M-and-Ms. Another two pair
sitting together, same last name.


426
00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:56.497
Married, cousins, who knows?
Be careful.


427
00:29:57.377 --> 00:29:59.416
Don't assume a deceased Mrs.
is for real.


428
00:29:59.712 --> 00:30:03.925
We don't wanna be the ones telling
some widow her husband died happy.


429
00:30:04.176 --> 00:30:08.590
And we don't wanna tell kids that Mom's
gone when Mom's asleep in Bethesda.


430
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.974
What does your sex life have to do
with saving social security?


431
00:30:12.226 --> 00:30:13.175
Tell me that.

432
00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:16.272
According to
Shirley Magnuson, everything.


433
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:19.598
What is the worst thing
you've ever done?


434
00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:22.474
If I've already done it,
it'll be a dull life.


435
00:30:22.778 --> 00:30:25.899
You're gonna be a big disappointment
to old Shirley.


436
00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:30.909
You think Cullen's the last man
you'll ever sleep with?


437
00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.907
College was best.
All that stuff going on.


438
00:30:37.418 --> 00:30:40.705
"When's he gonna call?
When's he gonna kiss me?"


439
00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:43.581
At night, when I bring it back...

440
00:30:44.384 --> 00:30:46.542
...I get that ache all over again.

441
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.384
I'll tell Richard to host
the fundraiser. Come over.


442
00:30:50.641 --> 00:30:52.549
Both of you.
We'll make a guest list.


443
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:54.267
He's in New York.

444
00:31:01.734 --> 00:31:03.812
What are you doing here on Saturday?

445
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:11.861
George and Clayton made bond.

446
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:15.655
You know this ain't the best case
we ever made.


447
00:31:16.667 --> 00:31:19.918
We got Clayton's statement.
Did you read him his rights?


448
00:31:20.547 --> 00:31:22.455
He'll say I didn't.

449
00:31:22.882 --> 00:31:24.257
We got Marvin.

450
00:31:26.095 --> 00:31:27.838
Something wrong with you?

451
00:31:33.144 --> 00:31:34.554
What's wrong, Dutch?

452
00:31:39.732 --> 00:31:41.228
Dick? Sorry.

453
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.231
Three A and B,
Mr. and Mrs. Cullen Chandler.


454
00:31:44.404 --> 00:31:45.353
No one's called.

455
00:31:45.655 --> 00:31:49.524
There's an unlisted number for
a Cullen Chandler at the Metropolitan.


456
00:31:50.786 --> 00:31:53.490
Doorman says Mrs. Chandler
is a congresswoman.


457
00:31:53.747 --> 00:31:56.749
And he saw her today.
She was going jogging.


458
00:31:57.293 --> 00:31:59.784
When I was small,
I knew my father was in politics.


459
00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:02.915
I didn't know what that was,
or why he went to Washington.


460
00:32:03.214 --> 00:32:05.374
Let's make it "dad." "My dad."

461
00:32:05.677 --> 00:32:09.009
Instead of "father."
Warms it up a little.


462
00:32:09.263 --> 00:32:10.805
"Dad." All right.

463
00:32:11.391 --> 00:32:13.430
Kay Chandler, take three.

464
00:32:14.602 --> 00:32:18.848
Hello. I'm Kay Chandler
and I'm running for Congress.


465
00:32:19.108 --> 00:32:21.776
When I was small,
I knew my dad was in politics--


466
00:32:22.027 --> 00:32:23.853
Maybe it should be "kid."

467
00:32:24.112 --> 00:32:26.187
"When I was a kid"...

468
00:32:26.447 --> 00:32:28.690
"When I was just a kid."
How about that?


469
00:32:29.326 --> 00:32:30.903
"When I was a kid."

470
00:32:33.287 --> 00:32:34.069
Help you?

471
00:32:36.583 --> 00:32:38.243
We need to speak to Mrs. Chandler.

472
00:32:38.502 --> 00:32:41.122
- We're taping.
- It's all right. What is it?


473
00:32:41.379 --> 00:32:44.583
Mrs. Chandler, I'm Dick Montoya.
This is Phyllis Bonaparte.


474
00:32:45.676 --> 00:32:47.585
We're with Southern Airlines.

475
00:32:48.636 --> 00:32:50.298
Is there somewhere we can talk?

476
00:32:50.932 --> 00:32:52.509
Well, about what?

477
00:32:54.977 --> 00:32:57.134
I'm very sorry to have to tell you.

478
00:32:58.481 --> 00:33:00.189
Your husband was on our flight...

479
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:02.184
...to Miami yesterday.

480
00:33:03.026 --> 00:33:03.808
What?

481
00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:05.529
The one that--

482
00:33:05.864 --> 00:33:09.149
No, no, no. Cullen's in New York.

483
00:33:09.784 --> 00:33:11.408
I wish that were so, ma'am.

484
00:33:13.664 --> 00:33:15.620
You do fly to New York, don't you?

485
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.827
Not from Washington, no, ma'am. No.

486
00:33:22.089 --> 00:33:23.796
The identification is correct.

487
00:33:26.259 --> 00:33:27.456
I'm awfully sorry.

488
00:33:30.764 --> 00:33:33.599
He said he was going to New York.
Why would he go to Miami?


489
00:33:36.521 --> 00:33:38.845
The identification is correct.
We have his wallet.


490
00:33:39.648 --> 00:33:41.190
I'm very sorry.

491
00:33:45.488 --> 00:33:48.856
If something happened to him
it'll lead the news tonight.


492
00:33:49.658 --> 00:33:50.689
Where's your daughter?

493
00:33:54.663 --> 00:33:56.988
We have a daughter. She's 15.

494
00:33:57.291 --> 00:34:00.412
We won't release the casualty list
till all families are notified.


495
00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.457
But we need your help
identifying your husband.


496
00:34:03.714 --> 00:34:04.829
Where is he?

497
00:34:05.716 --> 00:34:07.793
Patuxent Naval Air Station.

498
00:34:08.136 --> 00:34:11.006
- I have to get home.
- I understand. Let us help.


499
00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:15.140
Call Dick Taradisian at the White House.
Tell him what the deal is.


500
00:34:15.394 --> 00:34:18.762
Ask him if he can get a plane
to meet us at Patuxent.


501
00:34:19.063 --> 00:34:22.683
If the Air Force can't do it,
call GM or anybody with a jet.


502
00:34:28.364 --> 00:34:30.405
He did say Miami.

503
00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:34.360
Usually it's New York,
but this time he said Miami.


504
00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.862
Mr. Van Den Broeck,
we have a car for you.


505
00:36:58.144 --> 00:36:59.935
Ma, what are you doing home?

506
00:37:02.942 --> 00:37:04.317
Where's Dad?

507
00:37:36.559 --> 00:37:38.053
"Thou anointest my head with oil.

508
00:37:39.311 --> 00:37:40.721
My cup runneth over.

509
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.848
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me...


510
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.901
...all the days of my life...

511
00:37:47.152 --> 00:37:49.905
...and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."


512
00:37:50.157 --> 00:37:51.354
Let us pray.

513
00:37:52.116 --> 00:37:56.696
Almighty God, Father of mercies
and giver of all comfort...


514
00:37:57.206 --> 00:38:00.823
I met this guy because he was
smart enough to get out of the rain.


515
00:38:01.167 --> 00:38:02.791
I was too.

516
00:38:03.294 --> 00:38:06.628
So we waited under the arch
in the Law quad till it was over.


517
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.668
And then he asked me...

518
00:38:08.925 --> 00:38:11.001
...if I knew where the bookstore was.

519
00:38:11.929 --> 00:38:13.340
And I said...

520
00:38:13.722 --> 00:38:17.506
...I happened to be going there myself,
which was a lie, of course.


521
00:38:29.072 --> 00:38:31.479
We had so many great days.

522
00:38:34.826 --> 00:38:36.701
Just not enough years.

523
00:38:43.712 --> 00:38:45.704
But we had his love.

524
00:38:52.888 --> 00:38:54.002
Maybe I'll call you.

525
00:38:54.305 --> 00:38:55.087
Let's go.

526
00:39:07.153 --> 00:39:08.101
Excuse me.

527
00:39:09.905 --> 00:39:10.853
Excuse me.

528
00:39:11.864 --> 00:39:13.775
Are you Mary Claire Clark?

529
00:39:14.035 --> 00:39:15.410
Yes. I am so sorry.

530
00:39:15.661 --> 00:39:17.369
The name Cullen Chandler
mean anything?


531
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:21.489
No.

532
00:39:22.085 --> 00:39:24.955
If I'd called my wife that morning,
what would you have said?


533
00:39:26.004 --> 00:39:30.584
That she called in and said
she was taking the day off.


534
00:39:31.594 --> 00:39:35.045
But you wouldn't have gotten me.
She sent me to Tyson's Corners...


535
00:39:35.389 --> 00:39:37.015
...and said I could go home.

536
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:39.135
So I'd have gotten her voice mail?

537
00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:42.594
Thank you.

538
00:39:42.855 --> 00:39:44.481
Mr. Van Den Broeck...

539
00:39:46.026 --> 00:39:47.769
...I have some of her...

540
00:39:48.528 --> 00:39:51.148
...personal things.
I could drop them off--


541
00:39:51.447 --> 00:39:52.563
I'll take them now.

542
00:39:54.159 --> 00:39:55.487
I know.

543
00:39:55.744 --> 00:39:58.151
I gotta get out of here.
I'll take Jess.


544
00:39:58.871 --> 00:40:00.450
Kay, it's gonna look like--

545
00:40:00.708 --> 00:40:03.198
I don't care.
Just get us back to Washington.


546
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.240
I can't see these people.

547
00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:07.454
It's like going--

548
00:40:07.757 --> 00:40:11.540
Don't make a mistake now.
Everybody's watching.


549
00:40:13.595 --> 00:40:15.672
Just one more day.

550
00:40:41.582 --> 00:40:45.116
How can I find out if a guy
was on a flight to Miami in May?


551
00:41:29.214 --> 00:41:31.088
My name is Bill Van Den Broeck.

552
00:41:31.341 --> 00:41:33.584
- They said you're a policeman.
- I am.


553
00:41:35.263 --> 00:41:38.596
But I'm not working right now.

554
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.679
Then what is this about?

555
00:41:45.189 --> 00:41:48.108
My wife was on that plane
that your husband was on.


556
00:41:55.868 --> 00:41:57.492
I'm sorry.

557
00:41:58.787 --> 00:42:01.823
- I wonder if I could have a few minutes.
- I just got home.


558
00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:03.956
This isn't a good time for me.

559
00:42:04.335 --> 00:42:05.829
For me either.

560
00:42:22.269 --> 00:42:24.226
So you're visiting survivors.

561
00:42:26.358 --> 00:42:27.982
You're the only one.

562
00:42:30.611 --> 00:42:32.402
I'd ask you to sit--

563
00:42:36.784 --> 00:42:38.823
I don't understand.

564
00:42:45.418 --> 00:42:47.291
My daughter's due back any minute.

565
00:42:48.087 --> 00:42:49.666
Do you have kids?

566
00:42:53.468 --> 00:42:55.626
Jessica. She's 15.

567
00:43:00.934 --> 00:43:03.259
Is there something
you wanna know, Mr...?


568
00:43:05.523 --> 00:43:07.349
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

569
00:43:07.858 --> 00:43:09.482
It's Van Den Broeck.

570
00:43:15.574 --> 00:43:17.401
I just thought that...

571
00:43:20.163 --> 00:43:21.990
I'm so sorry.

572
00:43:23.708 --> 00:43:24.739
It's really...

573
00:43:28.338 --> 00:43:30.330
It's unspeakable.

574
00:43:32.341 --> 00:43:34.084
Unspeakable.

575
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.727
But you seem okay.

576
00:43:47.523 --> 00:43:48.899
Do I?

577
00:43:50.903 --> 00:43:53.903
Paper said your husband was a lawyer
in New Hampshire.


578
00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.234
He has an office here.

579
00:43:57.535 --> 00:43:59.693
Most of his work was here.

580
00:44:00.496 --> 00:44:01.610
I'm in Congress.

581
00:44:01.955 --> 00:44:03.283
Yeah, I know.

582
00:44:04.415 --> 00:44:06.575
So why was he going to Miami?

583
00:44:06.836 --> 00:44:07.950
Business.

584
00:44:09.505 --> 00:44:11.413
He had business there.

585
00:44:13.093 --> 00:44:14.800
Are you investigating something?

586
00:44:16.179 --> 00:44:18.669
They were sitting together on the plane.

587
00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.173
Your husband.

588
00:44:21.977 --> 00:44:23.518
My wife.

589
00:44:23.937 --> 00:44:24.802
Do you know that?

590
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.607
Three A and B.

591
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.058
First class.

592
00:44:32.987 --> 00:44:36.440
First class isn't what it used to be.
It's not worth the money.


593
00:44:42.997 --> 00:44:44.541
Is there anything else?

594
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.212
You mad at me?

595
00:44:51.424 --> 00:44:54.175
I don't know you, lieutenant.
Why would I be mad?


596
00:44:55.135 --> 00:44:56.333
I'm a sergeant.

597
00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:02.257
What are you? A sophisticator?

598
00:45:03.602 --> 00:45:05.226
That's my daughter.

599
00:45:11.068 --> 00:45:14.521
Sorry. An airline guy left
Dad's things downstairs...


600
00:45:14.823 --> 00:45:17.064
...so I brought them up.

601
00:45:21.872 --> 00:45:23.663
This is my daughter, Jessica.

602
00:45:25.583 --> 00:45:26.532
This is Sergeant--

603
00:45:26.793 --> 00:45:30.494
Van Den Broeck. They call me Dutch.
It's easier.


604
00:45:31.965 --> 00:45:34.123
He lost his wife on the plane.

605
00:45:37.013 --> 00:45:37.795
I'm sorry.

606
00:45:40.807 --> 00:45:44.176
Never been to New Hampshire.
You go to school there or here?


607
00:45:44.854 --> 00:45:47.890
I go to Andover. 
It's a prep school.

608
00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:53.477
I won't take any more of your time.

609
00:45:53.988 --> 00:45:56.479
- I'm sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.


610
00:45:56.907 --> 00:45:58.282
Nice to meet you.

611
00:46:13.632 --> 00:46:15.461
I need an hour.
It's not a lot to ask.


612
00:46:16.928 --> 00:46:18.588
Don't come around here again.

613
00:46:39.535 --> 00:46:41.112
They must've cleaned them.

614
00:47:03.726 --> 00:47:05.137
It must--

615
00:47:07.938 --> 00:47:10.016
I'm sure it's for your birthday.

616
00:47:10.567 --> 00:47:13.271
Dad said he was gonna
get you something great.


617
00:47:25.374 --> 00:47:26.156
Expensive.

618
00:47:27.125 --> 00:47:29.082
He knew I'd say no.

619
00:47:38.344 --> 00:47:40.422
I know you're worried about me...

620
00:47:40.681 --> 00:47:42.674
...but I still want you to run.

621
00:47:44.268 --> 00:47:45.809
I'll be fine.

622
00:47:46.644 --> 00:47:49.896
I don't want us to sit around here
all day and be depressed.


623
00:47:51.275 --> 00:47:53.351
I'm gonna go back to school tomorrow.

624
00:47:54.778 --> 00:47:57.946
All my friends are there.
And it's only 40 miles.


625
00:47:59.617 --> 00:48:02.285
I can come home
on weekends if I want.

626
00:48:16.926 --> 00:48:18.967
Somebody popped Marvin.

627
00:48:29.981 --> 00:48:31.641
Jesus Christ!

628
00:48:38.865 --> 00:48:39.980
Shit!

629
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.243
George Beaufort did this.

630
00:48:43.788 --> 00:48:45.863
What else did you
find in here? Anything?


631
00:48:47.874 --> 00:48:49.074
Is this a bad time?

632
00:48:49.878 --> 00:48:52.368
I don't need to go
through all that garbage.


633
00:48:55.215 --> 00:48:58.420
My case'll get kicked because
somebody killed my only witness.


634
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.293
- You get in there and do it!
- Easy, easy.


635
00:49:02.556 --> 00:49:04.799
The last pickup was a week ago.

636
00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.518
It hasn't been that long.

637
00:49:06.811 --> 00:49:08.186
It sure smells long.

638
00:49:11.859 --> 00:49:13.851
Sheila, what are you doing here?

639
00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:16.311
That ain't even my name.

640
00:49:18.572 --> 00:49:21.361
Let's talk to people.
Take that side. I'll take this side.


641
00:49:21.618 --> 00:49:22.816
It's Homicide's.

642
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.444
- We're off it.
- The hell we are.


643
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:48.049
- I will not allow you to--
- I have no choice. I need your help.


644
00:49:48.312 --> 00:49:51.018
Before you told me my husband
was screwing your wife...


645
00:49:51.274 --> 00:49:53.432
...did it occur to you that
that might be hurtful?


646
00:49:53.735 --> 00:49:54.849
You knew already.

647
00:49:55.861 --> 00:49:57.939
Suppose I didn't.

648
00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:00.650
How did you know?

649
00:50:01.826 --> 00:50:03.818
He told me he
was going to New York.

650
00:50:05.498 --> 00:50:07.988
He's on the wrong plane,
so it must be another woman?


651
00:50:08.375 --> 00:50:10.699
Well, it could've been amnesia.

652
00:50:12.128 --> 00:50:14.537
My wife was in Miami
in February and in May.


653
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.675
- Do you think your husband was?
- What difference does it make?


654
00:50:17.926 --> 00:50:19.965
It's over. It's entirely over.

655
00:50:20.219 --> 00:50:23.506
They're through with each other!
We are through with them!


656
00:50:23.807 --> 00:50:25.764
We can't even get a divorce!

657
00:50:27.227 --> 00:50:28.341
You can do that.

658
00:50:29.731 --> 00:50:31.224
I have a child.

659
00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:33.232
I try and go back...

660
00:50:34.025 --> 00:50:35.354
...in my head.

661
00:50:38.281 --> 00:50:39.988
What's the last thing
you remember...


662
00:50:40.241 --> 00:50:42.945
...about you and your husband
that you know is true?


663
00:50:46.873 --> 00:50:49.790
I gotta find out how far back
I have to go to do that.


664
00:50:53.213 --> 00:50:55.252
This is where they were gonna stay.

665
00:51:03.223 --> 00:51:04.337
I've got work to do.

666
00:51:05.016 --> 00:51:06.640
Don't you wanna know how it started?

667
00:51:08.103 --> 00:51:09.763
How long it was going on?

668
00:51:10.689 --> 00:51:13.891
You don't wanna know their plans?
You don't wanna know anything?


669
00:51:16.904 --> 00:51:19.062
What she thought
when she thought about me.


670
00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:24.153
I'd like to know that.

671
00:51:25.871 --> 00:51:28.658
I thought you might like to know
what she looked like.


672
00:51:31.586 --> 00:51:33.744
You leave me alone.

673
00:51:36.131 --> 00:51:37.710
I mean it.

674
00:51:41.971 --> 00:51:43.085
Thirty.

675
00:51:45.684 --> 00:51:47.842
Take a number and have a seat.

676
00:51:48.228 --> 00:51:50.718
Alice Beaufort? 
George Beaufort's wife?

677
00:51:51.605 --> 00:51:52.636
Is he all right?

678
00:51:53.067 --> 00:51:54.442
He's fine.

679
00:51:54.943 --> 00:51:58.394
I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck.
I'd like to ask a few questions.


680
00:52:00.072 --> 00:52:01.105
He was with me.

681
00:52:01.617 --> 00:52:02.566
What time was that?

682
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:05.117
Any time you're talking about.

683
00:52:07.246 --> 00:52:08.195
Thirty-one.

684
00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:18.591
You've got an envelope.

685
00:52:34.525 --> 00:52:36.850
February was swimsuits
and May was fall fashion.


686
00:52:37.277 --> 00:52:38.688
And you saw those catalogues?

687
00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:42.689
I saw the catalogues. I told you twice.
I'll get them for you.


688
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.867
How do we know she shot them in Miami?
What if--?


689
00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:47.402
There were palm trees.

690
00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:49.906
There was a beach
and a very big ocean.


691
00:52:53.002 --> 00:52:54.830
If she doesn't run, she's crazy.

692
00:52:55.089 --> 00:52:58.539
It's a sympathy bounce, but she's
up 14 points since the funeral.


693
00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:01.332
I think she'll stay in,
but she'll need some time.


694
00:53:01.677 --> 00:53:04.715
She's this brave widow with this kid.
They're eating it up.


695
00:53:04.973 --> 00:53:05.922
You're hard.

696
00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:08.058
She knows. I know she knows.

697
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:10.144
Maybe he was buying a boat.

698
00:53:10.438 --> 00:53:12.264
Maybe it was drugs
or government work.


699
00:53:12.523 --> 00:53:15.013
Why are you so determined
it's another woman?


700
00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:18.894
Why are you protecting him?
If you know who it is, I swear--


701
00:53:19.155 --> 00:53:22.155
You think I lied the first five times,
but now I'll cave?


702
00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:24.525
Why is this so important to you?

703
00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.447
I caught Sam with a woman once.

704
00:53:28.956 --> 00:53:32.040
I spilled a milkshake on my skirt,
so I ran home from lunch.


705
00:53:33.462 --> 00:53:35.454
I heard them in the shower.

706
00:53:36.797 --> 00:53:39.204
And at first, I thought
it was the radio.


707
00:53:40.761 --> 00:53:44.461
But what she was saying
you don't hear on the radio.


708
00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:47.096
I ran.

709
00:53:49.353 --> 00:53:51.392
I couldn't go back to work.

710
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.555
For hours, literally...

711
00:53:56.402 --> 00:53:58.477
...I didn't remember...

712
00:53:58.904 --> 00:54:01.525
...that I was involved
with someone else.


713
00:54:02.365 --> 00:54:04.525
I had been for months.

714
00:54:05.869 --> 00:54:08.953
And I liked my life with Sam.
Things were fine.


715
00:54:10.498 --> 00:54:11.614
What'd you do?

716
00:54:12.376 --> 00:54:14.416
I kept my mouth shut.

717
00:54:14.795 --> 00:54:17.879
And I never went home again
without calling first.


718
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.429
To say that involvement...

719
00:54:23.762 --> 00:54:27.215
...and I don't mean casual sex,
I mean romance.


720
00:54:28.017 --> 00:54:30.425
To say that that whole part
of life...


721
00:54:30.686 --> 00:54:32.927
...half the fun of life has to end...

722
00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.223
If you told me
that had to be over...

723
00:54:37.277 --> 00:54:39.150
...I'd feel old.

724
00:54:41.991 --> 00:54:44.148
If you had known about Peyton...

725
00:54:45.243 --> 00:54:46.867
...would you tell me?

726
00:54:48.412 --> 00:54:49.908
Now, I mean.

727
00:54:51.166 --> 00:54:52.281
No.

728
00:54:54.836 --> 00:54:56.745
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.

729
00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.871
Get me another one.

730
00:54:59.174 --> 00:55:03.337
Broman's over there dreaming up
ways to remind you of my loss.


731
00:55:04.595 --> 00:55:06.673
A detective came by
the office today...


732
00:55:06.974 --> 00:55:08.966
...asking about Cullen.

733
00:55:09.643 --> 00:55:13.724
I wasn't there. Barry said he asked
how much Cullen travelled.


734
00:55:14.107 --> 00:55:16.182
He seemed particularly
interested in Miami.


735
00:55:16.483 --> 00:55:19.056
Asked who our Miami clients were.

736
00:55:22.198 --> 00:55:24.819
Said he was going there tomorrow.

737
00:55:28.246 --> 00:55:30.998
Is this anything I should know about?

738
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:34.158
I have no idea.

739
00:55:42.843 --> 00:55:44.422
I'm sorry. It's too soon.

740
00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.304
- I'm sorry.
- I wanna go home.


741
00:55:46.598 --> 00:55:49.634
- Wait for Wendy.
- I'll get a cab. Tell Wendy I'm sorry.


742
00:56:16.546 --> 00:56:18.787
Leave a message. 
I'll call you back.

743
00:57:37.545 --> 00:57:39.455
Mr. Van Den Broeck? Hi.

744
00:57:39.715 --> 00:57:41.956
I'm so sorry about Peyton.

745
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:44.092
Come. Have a coffee.

746
00:57:44.385 --> 00:57:46.545
February, we shoot in the studios...

747
00:57:46.847 --> 00:57:50.298
...May, the Keys,
to get away from tourists.


748
00:57:51.476 --> 00:57:55.095
Why come to Miami twice in a row?
Why not go somewhere else?


749
00:57:55.356 --> 00:57:57.846
I would like to think
it was my work...


750
00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:02.229
...but I suspect so she can
walk the city and sketch.


751
00:58:03.489 --> 00:58:05.565
She loved the streets, the markets...

752
00:58:06.075 --> 00:58:07.023
...the Latin music.

753
00:58:07.367 --> 00:58:08.647
Was there a man?

754
00:58:11.122 --> 00:58:13.280
I don't think there is a man, no.

755
00:58:13.916 --> 00:58:16.489
What did she do after work?

756
00:58:18.421 --> 00:58:19.702
More walking.

757
00:58:19.964 --> 00:58:23.664
But sometimes the clubs,
for music and to watch the dancing.


758
00:58:24.261 --> 00:58:25.636
You know who she went with?

759
00:58:28.431 --> 00:58:30.257
If I can say...

760
00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.885
If you wanna be with a woman,
these shoots are not so good for that.


761
00:58:35.188 --> 00:58:37.097
Did you ever sleep with Peyton?

762
00:58:44.781 --> 00:58:47.106
Your situation is very difficult.

763
00:58:47.702 --> 00:58:49.575
I excuse the question.

764
00:59:18.233 --> 00:59:21.269
Could I talk to somebody
in your security department?


765
00:59:25.991 --> 00:59:27.533
It looks like she did.

766
01:00:44.405 --> 01:00:45.603
Can we talk someplace?

767
01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:57.616
Stoli, please, on the rocks.

768
01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:06.592
I'm from a little town
in a little state.


769
01:01:07.012 --> 01:01:08.838
Unfortunately, 
I'm in Congress.

770
01:01:09.097 --> 01:01:12.132
So when you interview people,
it's easy to start talk.


771
01:01:13.352 --> 01:01:16.720
They might stumble on the truth.
You can't possibly want that.


772
01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.182
- You're the only one I wanna talk to.
- I don't know anything!


773
01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.448
What do you wanna know?

774
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.737
- How long it went on.
- So we know how stupid to feel?


775
01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:38.035
How they met, their plans.

776
01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:39.492
I can't help you.

777
01:01:40.003 --> 01:01:41.118
At least you tried.

778
01:01:41.379 --> 01:01:43.087
You trying to be funny?

779
01:01:44.342 --> 01:01:46.749
No. Not anymore.

780
01:01:47.011 --> 01:01:49.501
Don't you fuck with me!

781
01:01:50.513 --> 01:01:52.673
If you don't like that word,
don't use it.


782
01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:57.509
Do you know what happens when a member
of Congress accuses you of harassment?


783
01:01:57.771 --> 01:01:59.849
We'd get our names in the newspapers.

784
01:02:00.108 --> 01:02:01.567
That's close to blackmail.

785
01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:02.683
I'm not a lawyer.

786
01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:06.685
I'm not some investigation.
You can't rummage through my life.


787
01:02:06.949 --> 01:02:09.783
Who's next on your list?
My neighbours, staff, friends?


788
01:02:10.035 --> 01:02:12.525
- Then talk to me.
- So you can paw through my marriage?


789
01:02:12.828 --> 01:02:16.530
Make me confess to something?
My life is mine to judge, not yours.


790
01:02:16.875 --> 01:02:18.369
You're not the only one involved.

791
01:02:19.085 --> 01:02:23.748
Look, if they find out about your wife,
it's gossip.


792
01:02:24.383 --> 01:02:27.502
If they find out about my husband,
it's in the papers.


793
01:02:27.802 --> 01:02:30.888
I have a daughter who adores
her father, who doesn't know.


794
01:02:31.182 --> 01:02:32.510
What do I tell her?

795
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.011
I don't know.

796
01:02:46.739 --> 01:02:48.150
Come on.

797
01:02:49.492 --> 01:02:51.069
I wanna show you something.

798
01:03:02.714 --> 01:03:04.422
Nice, huh?

799
01:03:06.634 --> 01:03:08.794
I figure they would've
had drinks here.


800
01:03:11.598 --> 01:03:12.547
Wanna see their room?

801
01:03:15.811 --> 01:03:17.969
- They never got here.
- Not this time.


802
01:03:20.398 --> 01:03:24.693
She stayed here February 19th.
Also May 14th, on business.


803
01:03:25.279 --> 01:03:27.604
If he was with her,
he didn't register.


804
01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:41.494
Did your husband like Latin stuff?
Music, dancing?


805
01:03:42.755 --> 01:03:43.620
Why?

806
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:47.175
The concierge booked them a table
at a place called La Roca.


807
01:03:47.677 --> 01:03:50.428
Cullen liked classical music.

808
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:52.805
You sure?

809
01:04:10.034 --> 01:04:10.982
What?

810
01:04:16.289 --> 01:04:18.247
Do you know what
I do for a living?

811
01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:20.700
I get paid to notice stuff.

812
01:04:21.003 --> 01:04:23.623
I get paid to know who's lying.

813
01:04:25.633 --> 01:04:27.044
I didn't have a clue.

814
01:04:30.428 --> 01:04:31.804
I missed it.

815
01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.899
I thought we were happy.

816
01:04:49.741 --> 01:04:51.199
Not giddy...

817
01:04:51.951 --> 01:04:53.409
...not ecstatic.

818
01:04:55.162 --> 01:04:57.073
We weren't unhappy.

819
01:04:59.709 --> 01:05:01.167
I wasn't.

820
01:05:02.962 --> 01:05:04.707
I was pretty happy.

821
01:05:59.604 --> 01:06:00.719
I don't wanna be here.

822
01:06:02.065 --> 01:06:03.973
I don't wanna be here.

823
01:06:14.245 --> 01:06:16.036
That's Kay Chandler.

824
01:06:18.706 --> 01:06:21.958
Peter Suchet. East Concord.
Voted for your dad.


825
01:06:22.253 --> 01:06:25.336
Do you mind?
Honey, take another picture.


826
01:06:27.215 --> 01:06:28.877
- They took our picture.
- You know them?


827
01:06:29.177 --> 01:06:31.667
They're from Concord.
They took our picture.


828
01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:34.794
I bury my husband
and go nightclubbing in Miami.


829
01:06:35.098 --> 01:06:37.341
- Stay here.
- Where are you going?


830
01:06:37.644 --> 01:06:38.675
To get the film.

831
01:06:38.978 --> 01:06:42.845
God, no! You can't just mug some guy.
It'll just make things worse.


832
01:06:49.697 --> 01:06:51.240
You are a cop.

833
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:58.989
Is that gonna be trouble for you?

834
01:07:02.169 --> 01:07:03.912
What'd we look like?

835
01:07:04.837 --> 01:07:06.333
Looked like--

836
01:07:07.383 --> 01:07:09.624
You had your hand on my shoulder.

837
01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:15.839
You don't care who knows, do you?

838
01:07:16.475 --> 01:07:18.266
About her and him, I mean.

839
01:07:20.353 --> 01:07:21.683
I care.

840
01:07:23.274 --> 01:07:25.101
They know anyway.

841
01:07:26.777 --> 01:07:29.400
Sooner or later,
everybody knows everything.


842
01:07:35.869 --> 01:07:38.029
What time is it? 
My plane's at 9:30.

843
01:07:38.373 --> 01:07:39.915
A little after 8.

844
01:07:43.502 --> 01:07:45.413
Sure you don't wanna stay over?

845
01:07:50.676 --> 01:07:51.625
Yes.

846
01:08:14.659 --> 01:08:16.618
Maybe we should split up.

847
01:09:51.176 --> 01:09:52.967
We should've stayed.

848
01:09:57.266 --> 01:09:59.223
I'm in restricted parking.

849
01:10:00.185 --> 01:10:01.560
I took the metro.

850
01:10:01.811 --> 01:10:03.390
It's not running now.

851
01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:05.139
I'll get a cab.

852
01:10:05.524 --> 01:10:06.899
Where do you live?

853
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:10.937
- Northwest. It's out of your way.
- Want me to drop you or not?


854
01:10:24.585 --> 01:10:25.915
You know where we're going.

855
01:10:36.139 --> 01:10:36.921
Why?

856
01:10:37.515 --> 01:10:38.890
Stayed? Why? Why?

857
01:10:39.183 --> 01:10:41.142
Because they were going to?

858
01:10:42.521 --> 01:10:43.849
Easy!

859
01:10:45.565 --> 01:10:47.641
Goddamn it. Stop it!

860
01:10:47.984 --> 01:10:49.017
Stop it now.

861
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.851
Well, that was fun.

862
01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:10.182
Don't.

863
01:12:10.861 --> 01:12:12.403
Just drive.

864
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.921
Unbelievable.

865
01:13:22.686 --> 01:13:25.686
- You want to come in, or--?
- Don't be ridiculous.


866
01:13:56.679 --> 01:13:59.169
Pick up the phone,
you son of a bitch.


867
01:13:59.598 --> 01:14:01.391
You like scaring women?

868
01:14:01.685 --> 01:14:04.471
You come around my wife
one more time and--


869
01:14:04.812 --> 01:14:08.858
No, no. You come and try to scare me,
asshole. Chickenshit.


870
01:14:09.776 --> 01:14:13.725
10.:52 p.m. End of messages.

871
01:14:17.951 --> 01:14:22.659
Last number called.: 555-4421.

872
01:14:22.913 --> 01:14:25.322
Press one to connect.

873
01:14:31.299 --> 01:14:32.674
Parkway Lanes.

874
01:14:32.967 --> 01:14:34.758
Is George Beaufort still there?

875
01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.450
Dutch, hold on, man.

876
01:16:02.849 --> 01:16:03.633
Take it outside!

877
01:16:04.019 --> 01:16:04.801
Take it outside!

878
01:16:05.687 --> 01:16:07.928
Son of a bitch! Get off me!
Get off me!


879
01:16:13.445 --> 01:16:14.310
Back off.

880
01:16:14.863 --> 01:16:15.811
Son of a bitch!

881
01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:16.979
Come on!

882
01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:19.694
Somebody call the police.

883
01:16:19.952 --> 01:16:22.110
I have your badge now, baby.

884
01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.676
You'd better get a lawyer.

885
01:16:45.686 --> 01:16:47.559
George killed that man.

886
01:16:48.146 --> 01:16:49.607
Goddamn it.

887
01:16:49.858 --> 01:16:52.858
You can't go around
beating up suspects.


888
01:16:53.152 --> 01:16:55.643
You're suspended.
There will be a trial board.


889
01:16:55.904 --> 01:16:58.397
You assaulted a man.
You can lose your job.


890
01:17:02.578 --> 01:17:05.746
What if somebody swore they saw
George at that dumpster?


891
01:17:05.999 --> 01:17:07.458
How tough would that be?

892
01:17:10.753 --> 01:17:13.874
I was thinking.
If you went to see the shrink...


893
01:17:14.925 --> 01:17:18.174
Wouldn't cost nothing.
Talk about Peyton. It could help.


894
01:17:18.469 --> 01:17:19.882
I don't need to talk about Peyton.

895
01:17:20.139 --> 01:17:24.088
I could tell them you got stressed out
on the job. It wouldn't be a lie.


896
01:17:57.718 --> 01:18:00.127
Honk if you're screwing him.
Save a plane ticket.


897
01:18:02.307 --> 01:18:03.848
Where'd you get that?

898
01:18:04.475 --> 01:18:06.019
Shirley Magnuson.

899
01:18:06.312 --> 01:18:09.514
Says she thinks it's phony.
Says I'm setting her up.


900
01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:10.638
Setting her up?

901
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.145
I take the picture,
get it slipped to her. She uses it.


902
01:18:14.403 --> 01:18:17.653
I provide a perfectly
innocent explanation.


903
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.408
- Her candidate's a mudslinger.
- My God, you people.


904
01:18:21.703 --> 01:18:23.280
Pretty good idea.

905
01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:25.444
I wish I'd had it.

906
01:18:32.129 --> 01:18:35.497
If you have to explain that picture,
can you do it?


907
01:18:37.302 --> 01:18:38.500
Yes.

908
01:19:03.453 --> 01:19:05.943
- Where's your bracelet?
- It's around.


909
01:19:06.247 --> 01:19:07.529
You didn't lose it?

910
01:19:07.792 --> 01:19:09.167
It's around.

911
01:19:12.587 --> 01:19:13.785
What's the matter?

912
01:19:19.094 --> 01:19:20.504
It's not my bracelet.

913
01:19:22.599 --> 01:19:23.381
What?

914
01:19:33.067 --> 01:19:36.020
Dad didn't have any clients
in Miami, did he?


915
01:19:42.576 --> 01:19:44.983
He was with that cop's wife, huh?

916
01:19:50.501 --> 01:19:52.125
What was going on?

917
01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.500
Something.

918
01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.460
I'm not sure what.

919
01:20:02.348 --> 01:20:03.628
Were they serious?

920
01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:07.593
That'd be my guess.

921
01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:22.191
Do a lot of people know?

922
01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.521
Leave a message. 
I'll call you back.

923
01:21:03.452 --> 01:21:04.483
It's me.

924
01:21:06.079 --> 01:21:08.486
Remember? From restricted parking?

925
01:21:09.874 --> 01:21:11.785
So you picked Peyton.

926
01:21:13.545 --> 01:21:15.621
And Cullen picked Peyton.

927
01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:19.796
That's two-zip against the home team.

928
01:21:22.763 --> 01:21:24.506
"Have we been introduced?"...

929
01:21:26.267 --> 01:21:28.592
...she says, straightening her clothes.

930
01:21:30.396 --> 01:21:34.264
I thought I should introduce myself
and fill you in on my plans.


931
01:21:34.568 --> 01:21:36.227
I'm packing it in.

932
01:21:36.736 --> 01:21:39.487
No. That sounds like suicide.

933
01:21:40.699 --> 01:21:43.450
All I mean is, like you said,
sooner or later...


934
01:21:43.743 --> 01:21:46.150
...everybody knows everything...

935
01:21:47.329 --> 01:21:49.573
...and this'll be in the papers...

936
01:21:50.959 --> 01:21:52.868
...and I can't handle that.

937
01:21:53.836 --> 01:21:57.289
I can't let Jessica be mowed down...

938
01:21:58.425 --> 01:22:00.916
...by gossip she had
nothing to do with.


939
01:22:07.309 --> 01:22:10.475
But if I'm not in Congress,
if I'm out...


940
01:22:11.648 --> 01:22:13.521
...it's not news anymore.

941
01:22:14.733 --> 01:22:15.931
She's safe.

942
01:22:16.318 --> 01:22:17.516
You know?

943
01:22:20.615 --> 01:22:23.401
You do know, don't you?

944
01:22:26.705 --> 01:22:28.614
You're the only one who does.

945
01:22:30.833 --> 01:22:32.493
And I miss that.

946
01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.122
Do me a favour.

947
01:22:38.424 --> 01:22:39.622
Erase this.

948
01:22:40.009 --> 01:22:42.086
God, I'm glad you're not there.

949
01:23:04.450 --> 01:23:07.025
She's getting a lot of points
for showing up.


950
01:23:07.288 --> 01:23:08.912
How are you guys doing?

951
01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:13.620
Excuse me for just a minute.

952
01:23:21.595 --> 01:23:23.172
My contribution.

953
01:23:30.228 --> 01:23:32.719
If you quit, they win.

954
01:23:33.898 --> 01:23:35.808
And the crash got us all.

955
01:23:37.069 --> 01:23:38.812
Don't let them do that.

956
01:23:40.613 --> 01:23:42.689
I'm not the only one involved.

957
01:23:43.324 --> 01:23:45.483
She should know her mom's no quitter.

958
01:23:46.745 --> 01:23:49.615
Wanna say how impressed I am
that you're staying in.


959
01:23:50.122 --> 01:23:51.784
I have to say a few things.

960
01:23:52.501 --> 01:23:56.545
The name of this group is
"Friends of Kay Chandler."


961
01:23:56.796 --> 01:23:59.205
I'm sorry about that phone call.

962
01:24:00.551 --> 01:24:02.424
We're not getting much sleep.

963
01:24:02.845 --> 01:24:05.417
- I'm afraid of what's playing.
- Me too.


964
01:24:06.014 --> 01:24:09.099
Might give it a try.
Turn in around 3.


965
01:24:09.352 --> 01:24:11.924
Cullen would be proud of you.
I know you know.


966
01:24:12.312 --> 01:24:15.564
I don't know how many times
I've introduced Kay Chandler.


967
01:24:16.401 --> 01:24:18.227
Miss a lot between 3 and 5.

968
01:24:19.153 --> 01:24:20.647
Australian football.

969
01:24:21.238 --> 01:24:22.947
May I present your friend...

970
01:24:23.742 --> 01:24:24.773
...your congresswoman...

971
01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:26.701
Don't go away.

972
01:24:26.952 --> 01:24:30.239
...your next representative for
the 2nd district of New Hampshire...


973
01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:32.658
...Kay Spencer
-Chandler!

974
01:24:39.549 --> 01:24:40.331
Thank you.

975
01:24:41.134 --> 01:24:43.091
Thank you, Richard. 
Thank you, all.

976
01:24:45.181 --> 01:24:46.805
It's good to be home.

977
01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:50.508
I wanted to say just a word.

978
01:24:51.227 --> 01:24:53.020
Just a few words.

979
01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:04.731
You're all being very nice to me.

980
01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.619
I don't wanna disappoint you.

981
01:25:16.922 --> 01:25:19.708
But I just don't wanna talk
politics tonight.


982
01:25:20.049 --> 01:25:21.626
I'm just glad to be home.

983
01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:26.922
Richard and Wendy, thank you so much.

984
01:25:29.016 --> 01:25:32.469
Thanks, all of you, for your friendship,
for your support...


985
01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:37.682
...for showing up here tonight.

986
01:25:38.359 --> 01:25:39.475
Thanks.

987
01:25:40.029 --> 01:25:41.487
I mean it.

988
01:25:43.073 --> 01:25:46.108
Don't leave without me getting
a chance to talk to you.


989
01:25:46.369 --> 01:25:47.993
We love you, Kay!

990
01:26:11.603 --> 01:26:13.394
Be back first thing.

991
01:26:19.569 --> 01:26:23.352
- Do you have the number?
- You told me 15 times already.


992
01:26:25.617 --> 01:26:26.566
Sorry.

993
01:26:37.795 --> 01:26:39.871
I wish I could
get out of the party.

994
01:26:40.174 --> 01:26:41.205
No way, missy.

995
01:26:41.509 --> 01:26:43.916
Some of these are $1000 folks.

996
01:26:45.387 --> 01:26:47.130
I just wish I didn't have to go.

997
01:26:50.851 --> 01:26:52.310
It was good of you to come.

998
01:26:54.437 --> 01:26:56.266
It was our party. 
Kind of had to.

999
01:26:56.524 --> 01:26:58.398
I appreciate it, that's all.

1000
01:27:00.235 --> 01:27:01.350
Thank you.

1001
01:27:19.798 --> 01:27:20.663
You get a ticket?

1002
01:27:21.049 --> 01:27:22.247
It's a road map.

1003
01:27:25.302 --> 01:27:27.629
Maybe someone thought
it fell out of my car.


1004
01:27:27.931 --> 01:27:28.880
Listen, Kay.

1005
01:27:29.141 --> 01:27:30.718
Time to commit.

1006
01:27:31.851 --> 01:27:33.644
All the way in or not.

1007
01:27:34.438 --> 01:27:38.221
If you're not running, we need to return
that fundraiser money quick.


1008
01:27:38.525 --> 01:27:41.562
Maybe I'll take a day.
Do some thinking.


1009
01:27:42.738 --> 01:27:44.113
I'll be around.

1010
01:28:36.419 --> 01:28:37.960
I wondered if you'd come.

1011
01:28:40.088 --> 01:28:43.340
Guy like you, girl like me.
What reason could there be not to?


1012
01:28:56.271 --> 01:29:00.270
Sorry I'm late. I had to change
a few times and pack. I thought...


1013
01:29:00.985 --> 01:29:04.603
...if I packed light, it'd look
like I knew what I was doing.


1014
01:29:04.905 --> 01:29:08.690
But I didn't know what I was doing,
so I didn't know what to pack.


1015
01:29:13.163 --> 01:29:14.873
Where are we exactly?

1016
01:29:15.667 --> 01:29:18.158
Chesapeake Bay's
a couple miles that way.


1017
01:29:30.933 --> 01:29:35.179
I won't make small talk. I don't want
there to be any junk between us.


1018
01:29:40.776 --> 01:29:42.151
No littering.

1019
01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:50.866
There's so many reasons
I might be doing this.


1020
01:29:53.164 --> 01:29:56.283
I kept thinking,
I'll go one more mile...


1021
01:29:56.834 --> 01:29:58.376
...then I'll turn around and...

1022
01:30:00.172 --> 01:30:02.496
I was thinking about your mouth.

1023
01:30:34.248 --> 01:30:36.323
Nobody knows who I am anymore.

1024
01:30:38.378 --> 01:30:40.868
Nobody knows how easily I can do this.

1025
01:30:41.714 --> 01:30:43.421
I know who you are.

1026
01:31:59.293 --> 01:32:01.369
I have to know something.

1027
01:32:03.173 --> 01:32:04.964
Are you a Democrat?

1028
01:32:07.302 --> 01:32:08.926
What if I am?

1029
01:32:09.847 --> 01:32:10.629
We talk.

1030
01:32:12.016 --> 01:32:13.759
I give you books to read.

1031
01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:30.409
I like it when there's
just the two of us.


1032
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:35.824
Are you hungry?

1033
01:32:36.332 --> 01:32:37.909
I'm hungry.

1034
01:32:44.257 --> 01:32:45.537
No TV?

1035
01:32:46.342 --> 01:32:47.622
Is there a phone?

1036
01:32:48.345 --> 01:32:49.625
Not so far.

1037
01:32:50.055 --> 01:32:51.465
What's that like?

1038
01:32:52.515 --> 01:32:53.713
Quiet.

1039
01:32:59.814 --> 01:33:01.688
What is this? Do you know?

1040
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:05.647
Heineken.

1041
01:33:07.239 --> 01:33:08.982
The start of something?

1042
01:33:15.997 --> 01:33:17.657
That's what I thought.

1043
01:33:20.586 --> 01:33:24.037
I want to know who is this woman
who's wearing my clothes...


1044
01:33:24.297 --> 01:33:26.088
...and using my body?

1045
01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:29.843
Is she permanent?

1046
01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:32.969
Or is she only around when you are?

1047
01:33:41.315 --> 01:33:44.317
Let's hide out here for a few years
and run for the border.


1048
01:33:45.778 --> 01:33:48.185
I always thought
when I had my time in...


1049
01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:51.116
...I'd like to live down here.

1050
01:33:51.952 --> 01:33:53.908
Start a little security service.

1051
01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:57.121
The raccoons are knocking over
the garbage cans?


1052
01:33:57.750 --> 01:34:01.118
A lot of Washington, Baltimore people
have places here.


1053
01:34:01.378 --> 01:34:03.085
They think they'll get robbed.

1054
01:34:05.258 --> 01:34:07.001
You had plans.

1055
01:34:10.178 --> 01:34:12.585
I don't think we had any plans.

1056
01:34:16.435 --> 01:34:18.226
I always wanted a boat.

1057
01:34:19.604 --> 01:34:21.148
One you could sleep on.

1058
01:34:21.691 --> 01:34:24.691
We've got a boat.
Defence Rests. Get it?


1059
01:34:28.615 --> 01:34:30.025
I've got a boat.

1060
01:34:40.584 --> 01:34:41.913
I'll give it to you.

1061
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.958
I don't trust this
any more than you do.


1062
01:34:52.348 --> 01:34:54.304
You're the only thing that's real.

1063
01:34:55.558 --> 01:34:57.301
Let me ask you something tough.

1064
01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.475
Are you sorry the plane went down?

1065
01:35:06.946 --> 01:35:08.321
What are you doing?

1066
01:35:08.948 --> 01:35:10.441
Just think about it.

1067
01:35:10.741 --> 01:35:13.065
You can have it all back
the way it was.


1068
01:35:15.705 --> 01:35:17.448
But you gotta take it all.

1069
01:35:18.957 --> 01:35:20.581
He's lying.

1070
01:35:21.209 --> 01:35:25.160
He's screwing another woman.
They laugh at how easy we are to fool.


1071
01:35:25.423 --> 01:35:27.047
Stop. Don't do that.

1072
01:35:28.091 --> 01:35:29.967
I'm done with them.

1073
01:35:30.428 --> 01:35:32.421
Done with them.

1074
01:35:40.271 --> 01:35:42.264
- The thing is...
- Stop.


1075
01:35:49.155 --> 01:35:50.353
Come on.

1076
01:35:51.324 --> 01:35:52.867
Let's go home.

1077
01:36:25.985 --> 01:36:29.021
You know those kits that tell you
when you're pregnant?


1078
01:36:29.321 --> 01:36:31.944
They should have one that tells you
when you're sane.


1079
01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.197
I think they had a place they'd meet.
An apartment just makes sense.


1080
01:36:39.708 --> 01:36:41.416
How could it make sense?

1081
01:36:43.378 --> 01:36:45.286
No driving, no motels.

1082
01:36:45.671 --> 01:36:47.998
If they did, they did.
They're on their own.


1083
01:36:52.387 --> 01:36:54.428
This was in her desk at work.

1084
01:36:58.518 --> 01:37:00.261
Is that why you drew the map?

1085
01:37:02.857 --> 01:37:05.643
- Is that why you came to Concord?
- I didn't want you to quit.


1086
01:37:05.901 --> 01:37:07.940
- People have keys.
- Did you see one like this?


1087
01:37:09.114 --> 01:37:10.905
In his luggage maybe?

1088
01:37:11.365 --> 01:37:13.404
So they had a place.

1089
01:37:13.742 --> 01:37:15.117
They're not there anymore.

1090
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:16.906
And I don't care.

1091
01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:18.990
I just don't care.

1092
01:37:20.791 --> 01:37:22.618
Maybe you didn't lose that much.

1093
01:37:28.508 --> 01:37:30.666
Or you're lying to yourself.

1094
01:37:34.556 --> 01:37:36.548
The sun's going down.

1095
01:37:38.225 --> 01:37:39.256
It's time to go.

1096
01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:50.148
When will you be back?

1097
01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.197
Roof's got a leak
and I got some time.

1098
01:37:56.287 --> 01:37:57.745
I thought I'd make it worse.

1099
01:38:10.258 --> 01:38:14.043
Maybe we'll never get clear of how
we met. Maybe we'll never be alone.


1100
01:38:14.638 --> 01:38:17.592
But I don't want us to lose
this chance because...


1101
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:22.093
...if it's just gonna be about them,
if it'll always be four of us--


1102
01:38:42.585 --> 01:38:44.411
You be careful driving home.

1103
01:38:53.929 --> 01:38:56.635
Thanks for driving
all the way to Concord.


1104
01:38:57.183 --> 01:38:59.092
And for the contribution.

1105
01:38:59.852 --> 01:39:02.259
And I don't even live
in your district.


1106
01:39:45.941 --> 01:39:47.767
You have one message.

1107
01:39:48.068 --> 01:39:50.060
It's me, Wendy.
Where've you been?


1108
01:39:50.321 --> 01:39:54.448
I have $50, 000 from your friends
and neighbours, and nobody to give it to.


1109
01:39:54.741 --> 01:39:57.946
What do you wanna do?
Lunch tomorrow? Give me a call.


1110
01:40:32.072 --> 01:40:33.352
Come on, Alcee.

1111
01:40:33.615 --> 01:40:35.322
Just get me a picture of him.

1112
01:40:35.575 --> 01:40:37.154
Headshot's okay.

1113
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:40.028
Give me the photo from his I.D.

1114
01:40:41.039 --> 01:40:42.699
I'll call you when I get back.

1115
01:40:43.082 --> 01:40:47.211
I want Jessica out there, smiling like
Chelsea and keeping her mouth shut.


1116
01:40:47.463 --> 01:40:49.787
Her job is good kid. No opinions.

1117
01:40:50.215 --> 01:40:53.051
She can wear jeans.
No short shorts, no bra tops.


1118
01:40:53.344 --> 01:40:54.838
No Jessica.

1119
01:40:55.096 --> 01:40:56.637
She's in school.

1120
01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:59.755
School? We're trying
to win an election here.


1121
01:41:00.185 --> 01:41:02.509
No Jessica. I don't want her--

1122
01:41:05.355 --> 01:41:08.393
I think I may be losing
what it takes to lie.


1123
01:41:08.652 --> 01:41:11.568
- This may become a problem.
- Let's take a break.


1124
01:41:11.821 --> 01:41:13.231
- I don't like this.
- Just asking.


1125
01:41:13.489 --> 01:41:16.859
We're telling the whole southeast side
an officer's a murder suspect.


1126
01:41:17.118 --> 01:41:20.736
You think George won't hear about this?
You're not supposed to be working.


1127
01:41:21.038 --> 01:41:22.451
That's why you're here.

1128
01:41:22.708 --> 01:41:24.499
Shyla? You in there?

1129
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:28.044
Anybody home?

1130
01:41:33.635 --> 01:41:35.295
We need to talk. 
Can we come in?

1131
01:41:35.553 --> 01:41:36.751
No, you can't come in.

1132
01:41:37.346 --> 01:41:38.297
You wanna come out?

1133
01:41:38.724 --> 01:41:41.678
Folks see me talk to you,
get my ass in trouble.


1134
01:41:42.269 --> 01:41:43.383
Goddamn it, Dutch!

1135
01:41:43.687 --> 01:41:44.967
Come on, man! Come on!

1136
01:41:46.024 --> 01:41:48.265
- You got no right in here!
- I won't hurt you.


1137
01:41:48.526 --> 01:41:51.230
Let's go. You got no warrant.
She said "no."


1138
01:41:51.486 --> 01:41:53.895
If my brother faced 15 months
in detention...


1139
01:41:54.199 --> 01:41:56.985
...it wouldn't hurt to look at
one picture. You seen this man?


1140
01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:00.034
That's Big George.
I see him all over.


1141
01:42:00.287 --> 01:42:02.162
Did you see him
when we found the body?


1142
01:42:03.124 --> 01:42:06.658
You didn't maybe see him dump
that man in the dumpster?


1143
01:42:08.797 --> 01:42:11.667
Take another look.
How's your brother?


1144
01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:13.039
Any chance he'll get out?

1145
01:42:13.384 --> 01:42:17.513
Okay, that's it! You didn't see him.
Sorry to have disturbed you.


1146
01:42:17.764 --> 01:42:20.433
I want you out right now!
Out now!


1147
01:42:22.268 --> 01:42:23.894
What's the matter with you?

1148
01:42:24.146 --> 01:42:26.637
Look, Dutch, I'm sorry about your wife.

1149
01:42:26.982 --> 01:42:28.974
You want George to come after you?

1150
01:42:29.275 --> 01:42:31.435
Is that it? So you can shoot him?

1151
01:42:32.655 --> 01:42:34.362
You got tired of working cheap?

1152
01:42:34.948 --> 01:42:37.902
You know he's guilty.
Why are you protecting him?


1153
01:42:39.912 --> 01:42:41.454
Is he paying you now?

1154
01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:45.416
Oh, man.

1155
01:42:59.723 --> 01:43:00.838
Here.

1156
01:43:01.808 --> 01:43:03.185
I feel like a bagman.

1157
01:43:03.478 --> 01:43:06.051
There's cash in there, so be careful.

1158
01:43:12.571 --> 01:43:14.812
Well, guess what?

1159
01:43:15.364 --> 01:43:16.906
Cullen was having an affair.

1160
01:43:21.538 --> 01:43:23.577
Tru says Ahi tuna's
incredible here.


1161
01:43:27.086 --> 01:43:28.628
That's why he went to Miami.

1162
01:43:30.505 --> 01:43:31.619
How long?

1163
01:43:32.215 --> 01:43:33.794
What's the difference?

1164
01:43:34.051 --> 01:43:38.380
You think being deaf, dumb and blind
is a liability for a congresswoman?


1165
01:43:42.351 --> 01:43:45.020
I think he kept an apartment
I don't know about.


1166
01:43:46.813 --> 01:43:50.065
- Would you like to hear our specials?
- Give us a minute.


1167
01:43:51.444 --> 01:43:53.068
And I thought maybe...

1168
01:43:55.572 --> 01:43:57.365
...Cullen had told Richard...

1169
01:43:57.659 --> 01:44:00.493
...and Richard had said something.

1170
01:44:06.626 --> 01:44:08.702
Come on. It's only adultery.

1171
01:44:11.674 --> 01:44:14.544
Nobody gives a damn
except the people it happens to.


1172
01:44:14.968 --> 01:44:16.343
It's not happening to--

1173
01:44:22.809 --> 01:44:24.469
My God.

1174
01:44:26.481 --> 01:44:29.149
Please give me a chance to explain.

1175
01:44:32.068 --> 01:44:33.183
Shut up.

1176
01:44:33.778 --> 01:44:35.523
Kay, it didn't mean...

1177
01:44:38.492 --> 01:44:39.820
I was gonna tell you.

1178
01:44:40.327 --> 01:44:41.787
Where is it?

1179
01:44:44.415 --> 01:44:46.906
It's been over a year.
I haven't been there--


1180
01:44:47.167 --> 01:44:48.365
Where is it?

1181
01:44:51.965 --> 01:44:54.538
The Colton Building on Rhode Island.

1182
01:44:58.639 --> 01:45:00.097
It was just stupid.

1183
01:45:00.348 --> 01:45:03.218
I'm not hungry.
If you could get the check, please.


1184
01:45:03.476 --> 01:45:05.102
Stop, please, Kay.

1185
01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.314
Just listen to me, okay, because...

1186
01:45:10.691 --> 01:45:12.769
...if we don't see you,
Richard'll know.


1187
01:45:13.946 --> 01:45:18.607
I can't keep seeing you so your husband
won't know you've been screwing mine.


1188
01:45:23.205 --> 01:45:24.070
Kay, please.

1189
01:45:25.207 --> 01:45:26.831
I need to tell you...

1190
01:45:27.583 --> 01:45:29.079
...how rotten I feel.

1191
01:45:31.672 --> 01:45:33.498
Let me go, punkin.

1192
01:45:48.397 --> 01:45:50.057
Hello. It's me.

1193
01:45:51.318 --> 01:45:52.432
Bad time?

1194
01:45:54.946 --> 01:45:56.404
How's the roof?

1195
01:45:57.823 --> 01:45:59.023
Lousy.

1196
01:46:00.244 --> 01:46:01.572
Something wrong?

1197
01:46:02.662 --> 01:46:03.990
Wanna get something to eat?

1198
01:46:04.247 --> 01:46:08.292
Sure. I'm not that hungry,
but I wanna see you.


1199
01:46:19.554 --> 01:46:20.929
Everything all right?

1200
01:46:32.943 --> 01:46:35.860
Weren't you ever tempted
to cheat on Peyton?


1201
01:46:37.657 --> 01:46:39.116
Tempted? Yeah.

1202
01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:40.608
Sure.

1203
01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.440
Why didn't you?

1204
01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:44.997
Maybe I did.

1205
01:46:47.375 --> 01:46:48.750
I don't think so.

1206
01:46:56.342 --> 01:47:00.424
I wonder how they got their
laundry done, if they had a place.


1207
01:47:13.776 --> 01:47:15.105
You think this...

1208
01:47:16.364 --> 01:47:18.190
...everything that happened...

1209
01:47:18.824 --> 01:47:20.282
You think it's...

1210
01:47:22.996 --> 01:47:24.655
...made you different?

1211
01:47:26.957 --> 01:47:28.155
Different how?

1212
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:30.077
More suspicious.

1213
01:47:30.879 --> 01:47:31.910
Maybe.

1214
01:47:35.091 --> 01:47:36.798
But here I am.

1215
01:47:41.931 --> 01:47:43.508
I'm leaving you tomorrow.

1216
01:47:43.933 --> 01:47:46.259
I knew we should've gone
to McDonald's.


1217
01:47:46.728 --> 01:47:48.519
I have to try to get elected.

1218
01:47:52.983 --> 01:47:54.859
I lost a friend today...

1219
01:47:56.613 --> 01:47:58.486
...being suspicious.

1220
01:48:04.163 --> 01:48:05.538
What if you don't get elected?

1221
01:48:07.957 --> 01:48:09.667
Country goes to hell...

1222
01:48:11.128 --> 01:48:12.836
...and I go home.

1223
01:48:14.297 --> 01:48:15.672
For keeps.

1224
01:48:22.556 --> 01:48:24.882
But you're gonna beat this guy, right?

1225
01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:35.354
When I get back...

1226
01:48:36.529 --> 01:48:37.727
I'll be here.

1227
01:48:40.617 --> 01:48:42.241
I'll nail his ass.

1228
01:48:59.386 --> 01:49:00.417
Here you go, Clara.

1229
01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.095
Back Friday.

1230
01:49:02.388 --> 01:49:03.670
Wait up a second.

1231
01:49:04.183 --> 01:49:06.140
You got some dry cleaning.

1232
01:49:19.699 --> 01:49:20.481
Sorry.

1233
01:49:26.957 --> 01:49:28.865
Saks Fifth Avenue.
Employees' entrance.


1234
01:49:29.125 --> 01:49:30.156
I'll get him.

1235
01:49:53.316 --> 01:49:54.098
Sorry, Dutch.

1236
01:49:54.359 --> 01:49:55.639
Ladies' room.

1237
01:49:56.068 --> 01:49:56.852
Mary Claire.

1238
01:50:02.784 --> 01:50:05.703
You wouldn't believe
all the keys I've got.


1239
01:50:05.997 --> 01:50:08.321
I got a key to the Vic Tanny's
in Rochester.


1240
01:50:08.749 --> 01:50:11.751
I've got keys to the ones
in Westchester.


1241
01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:15.002
I don't think there was an apartment.

1242
01:50:15.422 --> 01:50:18.588
She was always here.
There wasn't time.


1243
01:50:21.096 --> 01:50:22.293
No, wait.

1244
01:50:22.555 --> 01:50:25.555
You know, she gave me
a phone number once.


1245
01:50:25.974 --> 01:50:28.134
She was on her way to a meeting--

1246
01:50:28.603 --> 01:50:30.062
Just a minute.

1247
01:50:30.730 --> 01:50:31.512
This is it.

1248
01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:36.520
In the bottom, in pencil.

1249
01:50:38.196 --> 01:50:39.856
Go right ahead.

1250
01:50:47.622 --> 01:50:49.697
Can I have the 911 supervisor?

1251
01:50:51.252 --> 01:50:52.283
Sergeant Van Den Broeck.

1252
01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:55.754
D.C. Internal Affairs, 9114.

1253
01:50:56.172 --> 01:50:58.665
I need an address
for a telephone number.


1254
01:53:10.687 --> 01:53:11.884
How long did you know?

1255
01:53:14.690 --> 01:53:17.182
Did you know when you came to Miami?

1256
01:53:19.195 --> 01:53:20.393
How could you think--?

1257
01:53:22.823 --> 01:53:24.485
When you came to my cabin,
did you know?


1258
01:53:25.410 --> 01:53:26.904
I found out yesterday.

1259
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:30.656
So you knew last night.

1260
01:53:35.378 --> 01:53:36.837
When were you gonna tell me?

1261
01:53:38.883 --> 01:53:40.211
I thought...

1262
01:53:42.719 --> 01:53:44.297
I thought maybe...

1263
01:53:45.305 --> 01:53:47.299
...years from now...

1264
01:53:47.683 --> 01:53:49.343
...when it's behind us.

1265
01:53:52.479 --> 01:53:53.937
What did you find?

1266
01:53:57.276 --> 01:53:58.474
Nothing.

1267
01:54:03.867 --> 01:54:05.325
Dutch, you weren't...

1268
01:54:06.785 --> 01:54:07.651
We had a pact.

1269
01:54:08.245 --> 01:54:09.705
Then why are you here?

1270
01:54:10.082 --> 01:54:12.074
I wanna finish it. 
I want it over.

1271
01:54:16.837 --> 01:54:18.831
That your purse? 
What'd you find?

1272
01:54:19.132 --> 01:54:20.507
What did you find?

1273
01:54:34.815 --> 01:54:36.724
There's nothing here.

1274
01:54:47.702 --> 01:54:49.114
Oh, Christ.

1275
01:54:49.414 --> 01:54:51.571
I can smell her perfume.

1276
01:55:16.023 --> 01:55:17.434
Stop it, Dutch.

1277
01:55:21.905 --> 01:55:23.447
There's nothing here.

1278
01:55:25.157 --> 01:55:27.650
There's gotta be something left...

1279
01:55:29.496 --> 01:55:30.954
...some sign of--

1280
01:55:31.206 --> 01:55:31.988
Stop it!

1281
01:55:33.583 --> 01:55:36.419
You'll never find
what you're looking for. Never.


1282
01:55:38.547 --> 01:55:40.171
You wanna know why.

1283
01:55:40.465 --> 01:55:42.625
And there is no why.

1284
01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:00.935
Don't.

1285
01:56:11.664 --> 01:56:15.614
If you check in, I'm heading for
the airport early. Meet me for coffee.


1286
01:56:17.837 --> 01:56:19.829
Hi, it's me. I'm running late.

1287
01:56:20.091 --> 01:56:23.625
There was something I needed to do.

1288
01:56:25.053 --> 01:56:28.838
Go without me. I'll get the next
plane and meet you at the hotel.


1289
01:56:30.517 --> 01:56:32.675
What are we doing? Do you know?

1290
01:56:56.585 --> 01:56:58.579
We made love that morning.

1291
01:57:02.925 --> 01:57:04.799
That's why she was late.

1292
01:58:19.754 --> 01:58:20.869
Get an ambulance!

1293
01:58:21.256 --> 01:58:22.536
I'm okay.

1294
01:58:22.967 --> 01:58:25.125
Get out of the car! Get out!

1295
01:58:26.261 --> 01:58:27.672
Help!

1296
01:58:34.436 --> 01:58:36.263
Kay Chandler, congresswoman.

1297
01:58:36.563 --> 01:58:39.933
Police report said her husband got it on
with Van Den Broeck's wife.


1298
01:58:40.276 --> 01:58:42.601
He kept a love shack in the building.

1299
01:58:50.036 --> 01:58:51.233
You all right?

1300
01:58:53.121 --> 01:58:55.614
The press is out there
and they know you're here.


1301
01:58:55.917 --> 01:58:58.953
They could get hungry
and go somewhere for a hamburger.


1302
01:58:59.253 --> 01:59:00.961
How we gonna handle this?

1303
01:59:01.965 --> 01:59:06.211
"Handle it" is when you got a client
who'll tell you what's going on.


1304
01:59:07.303 --> 01:59:10.922
They'll wanna know just how well
the congresswoman knows the cop.


1305
01:59:11.183 --> 01:59:13.222
- How will we handle this?
- I don't know.


1306
01:59:16.145 --> 01:59:18.898
If we can get back to New Hampshire
and let this age a day...


1307
01:59:19.566 --> 01:59:21.808
We'll leave through the basement.

1308
01:59:22.986 --> 01:59:24.363
He's right, Kay.

1309
01:59:55.646 --> 01:59:57.104
What time is it?

1310
01:59:58.606 --> 02:00:02.057
- It's almost midnight.
- Somebody stole my watch.


1311
02:00:06.281 --> 02:00:07.739
Where's Alcee?

1312
02:00:08.783 --> 02:00:10.860
He said he'd come by tomorrow.

1313
02:00:21.755 --> 02:00:23.997
I was trying to catch up with you.

1314
02:00:26.219 --> 02:00:27.962
What were you going to say?

1315
02:00:29.638 --> 02:00:32.342
I don't know what I was gonna say.
I just...


1316
02:00:33.393 --> 02:00:36.393
I just didn't want you to leave.
Not like that, anyway.


1317
02:00:38.939 --> 02:00:40.812
Welcome back. Hungry?

1318
02:00:41.068 --> 02:00:42.266
Where's my watch?

1319
02:00:42.569 --> 02:00:43.979
They need you in X-ray.

1320
02:00:49.368 --> 02:00:50.696
Listen...

1321
02:00:53.204 --> 02:00:58.199
...I probably never would've told you
about the place either.


1322
02:01:00.462 --> 02:01:01.837
All I wanted...

1323
02:01:04.342 --> 02:01:06.168
What I want, really...

1324
02:01:08.678 --> 02:01:10.920
...is just to find some way...

1325
02:01:11.808 --> 02:01:13.005
...to let her go...

1326
02:01:17.437 --> 02:01:18.895
...and move on.

1327
02:01:21.734 --> 02:01:23.810
I don't know how you do that.

1328
02:01:31.535 --> 02:01:33.077
Neither do I.

1329
02:01:34.412 --> 02:01:36.122
It's not a crime, Dutch.

1330
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:38.957
You loved your wife.

1331
02:01:42.339 --> 02:01:43.881
And you still do.

1332
02:01:48.552 --> 02:01:51.258
All set. Let me see
if I can find some orderlies.


1333
02:01:52.557 --> 02:01:54.300
Will you hang around?

1334
02:01:57.855 --> 02:01:59.183
I can't.

1335
02:01:59.606 --> 02:02:02.179
You're supposed to be nice.
I've been shot.


1336
02:02:10.909 --> 02:02:13.069
We did okay, Dutch.

1337
02:02:16.248 --> 02:02:18.157
We did the best we could...

1338
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.876
...under the circumstances.

1339
02:02:24.298 --> 02:02:25.673
We ready, sergeant?

1340
02:02:26.842 --> 02:02:29.548
It's time for you to go. Me too.

1341
02:02:33.724 --> 02:02:35.182
Will that be all right?

1342
02:02:45.445 --> 02:02:46.560
So long, Kay.

1343
02:02:58.749 --> 02:02:59.866
Here she comes.

1344
02:03:00.127 --> 02:03:02.203
Can you tell us what you were doing...?

1345
02:03:02.504 --> 02:03:04.081
What's the sergeant's condition?

1346
02:03:04.339 --> 02:03:07.377
I've gotta catch a plane,
but if you can make it short...


1347
02:03:07.927 --> 02:03:11.971
We're told your husband had an affair
with Van Den Broeck's wife.


1348
02:03:12.472 --> 02:03:16.720
They had an apartment, and that's
where you were. Is that correct?


1349
02:03:21.523 --> 02:03:22.900
Yes, it is.

1350
02:03:25.903 --> 02:03:28.690
Characterize your relationship
with the sergeant.


1351
02:03:29.992 --> 02:03:34.403
The sergeant's wife was killed on the
plane that went down with my husband.


1352
02:03:35.663 --> 02:03:38.784
I met the sergeant
a few days after that day.


1353
02:03:40.001 --> 02:03:44.579
He was a friend when I needed a friend.
I hope he feels the same way.


1354
02:03:44.963 --> 02:03:46.507
So you're just friends?

1355
02:03:47.301 --> 02:03:49.044
Just friends.

1356
02:03:50.178 --> 02:03:52.135
We are surely friends.

1357
02:03:53.766 --> 02:03:56.470
We've seen each other
through something...


1358
02:03:57.310 --> 02:04:00.311
We're more than friends.
We're survivors.


1359
02:04:03.484 --> 02:04:06.105
You'll have to excuse me.
I have to get home.


1360
02:04:06.403 --> 02:04:09.440
Can you tell us more
about the sergeant's condition?


1361
02:04:44.901 --> 02:04:47.607
- See you Friday, sweetie.
- Bye, Mom.


1362
02:05:12.638 --> 02:05:14.097
Bye, Mrs. Chandler.

1363
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:15.504
Merry Christmas.

1364
02:05:15.807 --> 02:05:18.382
Merry Christmas. 
Do I know you?

1365
02:05:18.645 --> 02:05:21.349
I'm Tad Baker.
I work for Mr. Cornelius.


1366
02:05:22.523 --> 02:05:24.100
You said we could...

1367
02:05:26.111 --> 02:05:29.111
Yeah, sure. Make yourselves at home.

1368
02:06:11.741 --> 02:06:12.772
Hello, Kay.

1369
02:06:13.201 --> 02:06:14.315
Hi, sergeant.

1370
02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:15.858
Lieutenant.

1371
02:06:16.662 --> 02:06:19.913
They made me a lieutenant.
All I had to do was get shot.


1372
02:06:21.251 --> 02:06:24.121
Can I get you something?
Stoli on the rocks.


1373
02:06:25.337 --> 02:06:27.746
I haven't had one
of those in a while.

1374
02:06:28.633 --> 02:06:30.211
I got a plane.
I don't have time.


1375
02:06:30.969 --> 02:06:34.303
What's with those New Hampshire voters?
Are they crazy?


1376
02:06:34.765 --> 02:06:37.090
They could tell
I didn't want the job.


1377
02:06:37.434 --> 02:06:41.051
Or I wanted it. I just didn't
wanna do what you have to do to get it.


1378
02:06:43.399 --> 02:06:44.513
So you're out of work.

1379
02:06:45.442 --> 02:06:47.019
Guess I am.

1380
02:06:50.615 --> 02:06:52.239
Are you as well as you look?

1381
02:06:53.617 --> 02:06:55.325
Leg's a little stiff.

1382
02:06:57.664 --> 02:06:59.988
But I think I'm gonna be okay.

1383
02:07:00.708 --> 02:07:01.906
You?

1384
02:07:05.755 --> 02:07:07.249
How's football in Australia?

1385
02:07:09.967 --> 02:07:11.924
I tune in once in a while.

1386
02:07:12.177 --> 02:07:14.005
Not like before.

1387
02:07:15.265 --> 02:07:16.675
I was a real fan.

1388
02:07:21.021 --> 02:07:24.021
I gotta tell you,
I thought I might run into you here.


1389
02:07:24.357 --> 02:07:25.471
Where are you going?

1390
02:07:27.862 --> 02:07:29.439
That's the thing. Nowhere.

1391
02:07:29.738 --> 02:07:33.189
I called your office,
and they said that you were...


1392
02:07:33.533 --> 02:07:35.491
...headed home, so...

1393
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:45.460
My flight's overbooked and I--

1394
02:07:46.213 --> 02:07:47.078
Go later.

1395
02:07:48.882 --> 02:07:50.541
Take another plane.

1396
02:07:59.978 --> 02:08:03.061
It's my Christmas present,
running into you.


1397
02:08:11.405 --> 02:08:12.685
What'd you get me?

1398
02:08:18.079 --> 02:08:19.489
How about...

1399
02:08:20.122 --> 02:08:22.531
...I call you up sometime
in New Hampshire?


1400
02:08:24.878 --> 02:08:26.372
And say what?

1401
02:08:28.506 --> 02:08:29.918
Say...

1402
02:08:30.634 --> 02:08:32.045
..."You wanna go to a movie?"

1403
02:08:40.185 --> 02:08:41.596
What do you say?

1404
02:08:48.110 --> 02:08:50.019
Wouldn't that be something?
