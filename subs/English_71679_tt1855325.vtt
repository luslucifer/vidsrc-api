00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.108
<i>My name is Alice.</i>

2
00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:28.319
<i>I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation...</i>


3
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:32.236
<i>...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.</i>


4
00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:35.872
<i>I was head of security at a secret
high-tech facility called the Hive...</i>


5
00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:41.580
<i>...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental, viral weaponry.</i>


6
00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:43.872
<i>There was an incident.</i>

7
00:04:45.248 --> 00:04:46.670
<i>A virus escaped.</i>

8
00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.802
<i>A lot of people died.</i>

9
00:04:52.047 --> 00:04:55.551
<i>The trouble was,
they didn't stay dead.</i>


10
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:00.935
<i>The computer that controlled the Hive
was a state-of-the-art...</i>


11
00:05:01.097 --> 00:05:03.475
<i>...artificial intelligence:
the Red Queen.</i>


12
00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:10.524
<i>The Red Queen responded to the threat
of the viral outbreak in an extreme way.</i>


13
00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:12.735
<i>She went homicidal.</i>

14
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:15.245
<i>You're all going to die down here.</i>

15
00:05:15.403 --> 00:05:17.405
<i>The Red Queen
attempted to kill everyone...</i>


16
00:05:17.572 --> 00:05:20.166
<i>- Down!
- ...whether they were infected or not.</i>


17
00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:26.586
<i>I managed to escape,
but this was only the beginning.</i>


18
00:05:30.377 --> 00:05:33.347
<i>Viral outbreaks spread like wildfire...</i>

19
00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:37.559
<i>...first across the United States,
then the world.</i>


20
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:42.890
<i>The T-Virus didn't just bring
the dead back to life.</i>


21
00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:45.980
<i>It mutated them in terrifying ways.</i>

22
00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:49.897
<i>Despite the apocalypse
they had created...</i>


23
00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:54.239
<i>...the Umbrella Corporation continued
to experiment with the deadly virus.</i>


24
00:05:55.235 --> 00:05:56.782
<i>I was infected.</i>

25
00:05:56.945 --> 00:06:00.119
<i>But the virus bonded with me
on a cellular level.</i>


26
00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:02.659
<i>I developed powers.</i>

27
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.708
<i>Your genetic structure is the key.</i>

28
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.543
<i>I became different.</i>

29
00:06:09.207 --> 00:06:10.834
<i>Powerful.</i>

30
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:12.844
<i>Unstoppable.</i>

31
00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:18.137
<i>As I got stronger,
the human race became weaker.</i>


32
00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:22.305
<i>I tried my best to lead
what survivors I could find to safety...</i>


33
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.814
<i>...but we were pursued relentlessly.</i>

34
00:06:24.973 --> 00:06:28.193
<i>Even my friend Jill Valentine was seized
and brainwashed by Umbrella.</i>


35
00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:29.773
<i>Shoot to kill.</i>

36
00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:33.065
<i>Finally, I confronted
the head of the Umbrella Corporation...</i>


37
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:35.325
<i>...Albert Wesker.</i>

38
00:06:35.483 --> 00:06:39.738
<i>He robbed me of my powers,
but I still managed to defeat him.</i>


39
00:06:39.904 --> 00:06:43.659
<i>At last, we thought it was over.</i>

40
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:46.545
<i>We thought We had survived
the horror.</i>


41
00:06:49.998 --> 00:06:51.875
<i>But we were wrong.</i>

42
00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:56.388
<i>Once again,
we found ourselves fighting...</i>


43
00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:58.048
<i>...for our lives.</i>

44
00:07:06.014 --> 00:07:07.641
Go, go, go!

45
00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:02.824
Rise and shine.

46
00:08:03.947 --> 00:08:06.450
Come on, babe.
We're late.


47
00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:08.539
The alarm didn't go off.

48
00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:10.795
Becky's not up yet.

49
00:08:10.954 --> 00:08:13.503
Miss Henderson's gonna be pissed.

50
00:08:13.665 --> 00:08:17.260
You know how they get when you
drop her off late at the school.


51
00:08:24.217 --> 00:08:26.720
Babe? You all right, babe?

52
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.397
Yeah.

53
00:08:32.183 --> 00:08:33.309
I'll go get Becky.

54
00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:38.398
I charged your batteries for you.

55
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:45.155
Becky, you know Miss Henderson...

56
00:08:45.905 --> 00:08:48.784
...she wants you to speak
while you sign.


57
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.748
Thank you, Daddy.

58
00:08:51.953 --> 00:08:55.924
When you come back from school,
I have a surprise for you.


59
00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:57.755
I heard that.

60
00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:01.842
By the way, these batteries
are lasting less and less.


61
00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:03.348
We need to get some new ones.

62
00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:05.423
Okay, well I can pick some up
on my way home.


63
00:09:05.508 --> 00:09:07.308
I'm gonna be late, again.

64
00:09:09.512 --> 00:09:10.604
Oh, shit.

65
00:09:10.763 --> 00:09:13.481
I'll get you another shirt
from the bedroom.


66
00:09:13.892 --> 00:09:16.065
Someone picked up
your dry-cleaning yesterday.


67
00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:19.485
You are my little angel, aren't you?

68
00:09:19.814 --> 00:09:21.282
You're gonna be late, remember?

69
00:09:21.774 --> 00:09:22.741
Oh, yeah.

70
00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:27.155
I'll get you that shirt.

71
00:09:29.616 --> 00:09:30.367
Get Becky back!

72
00:09:33.411 --> 00:09:34.708
No!

73
00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:39.380
No!

74
00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:47.176
Help! Help us!

75
00:09:58.645 --> 00:09:59.737
Come on. Come on!

76
00:10:01.022 --> 00:10:01.739
Come on.

77
00:10:19.207 --> 00:10:20.208
Go.

78
00:10:21.376 --> 00:10:22.719
Go.

79
00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:21.274
Go!

80
00:11:22.562 --> 00:11:23.905
Go!

81
00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:26.528
No!

82
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.128
- Back!
- Wait!


83
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.166
- Wait!
- Stay back!


84
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:47.928
What is wrong with you?

85
00:11:50.006 --> 00:11:51.175
Come on,
get in the car!


86
00:12:07.565 --> 00:12:08.862
What's going on?

87
00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:10.242
Your guess is as good as mine.

88
00:12:10.401 --> 00:12:11.448
Why are these people...

89
00:12:11.611 --> 00:12:14.330
- ...doing this?
- Those things are not people. Not any...


90
00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:39.806
Are you hurt?

91
00:12:42.934 --> 00:12:45.357
Can you move?
Okay.


92
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.497
Come on.

93
00:13:05.998 --> 00:13:07.045
Oh, shit!

94
00:13:14.757 --> 00:13:16.384
Mommy.

95
00:13:16.551 --> 00:13:17.552
Mommy, come on.

96
00:13:17.718 --> 00:13:18.890
Go!

97
00:14:02.388 --> 00:14:04.641
<i>I love you.</i>

98
00:15:46.784 --> 00:15:48.707
Project Alice...

99
00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:51.589
...why did you turn against Umbrella?

100
00:15:52.248 --> 00:15:53.295
Jill?

101
00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:55.377
Is that you?

102
00:15:55.543 --> 00:15:57.170
Project Alice...

103
00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.549
...why did you turn against Umbrella?

104
00:16:00.715 --> 00:16:03.184
What happened to Chris and Claire?

105
00:16:03.342 --> 00:16:05.060
Where are the others from the ship?

106
00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:24.329
Project Alice...

107
00:16:24.989 --> 00:16:27.583
...who do you work for?

108
00:16:29.327 --> 00:16:30.670
Project Alice...

109
00:16:33.164 --> 00:16:34.791
...who do you work for?

110
00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:39.838
Jill, why are you doing this?!

111
00:17:03.986 --> 00:17:05.488
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

Scramble all security teams.

130
00:18:19.937 --> 00:18:22.648
And sweep the corridor
with the laser grid.


131

<i>Stand by.</i>

132
00:19:46.649 --> 00:19:47.946

<i>Stand by.</i>

136
00:24:58.961 --> 00:25:03.091
<i>Welcome to Umbrella Central Control.</i>

137
00:25:27.239 --> 00:25:28.707
Oh, yeah.

138
00:25:53.056 --> 00:25:54.148
Don't.

139
00:25:54.308 --> 00:25:56.106
- My name is...
- Ada Wong.


140
00:25:56.268 --> 00:25:59.989
Operative for the Umbrella Corporation,
one of Albert Wesker's top agents.


141
00:26:00.147 --> 00:26:03.902
I know exactly who and what you are.

142
00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:05.944
Now, the real question is:

143
00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:08.409
Why don't I just cancel
your contract right now?


144
00:26:08.864 --> 00:26:11.367
I don't work for Umbrella anymore...

145
00:26:11.992 --> 00:26:14.336
...and neither does Albert Wesker.

146
00:26:14.494 --> 00:26:15.746
I don't care.

147
00:26:15.913 --> 00:26:17.665
<i>You can kill her if you like...</i>

148
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:20.254
<i>...but then you'll never get out
of this place.</i>


149
00:26:20.417 --> 00:26:22.465
- Wesker!
<i>- Now, be a good girl.</i>


150
00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:23.758
<i>Put down the knife.</i>

151
00:26:26.253 --> 00:26:29.635
<i>Oh, and, Alice...
How nice to see you again.</i>


152
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.887
<i>How did she get out?</i>

153
00:26:32.054 --> 00:26:33.852
She's obviously getting help.

154
00:26:34.014 --> 00:26:36.608
We have a traitor in this facility.

155
00:26:36.767 --> 00:26:38.940
<i>Security systems were shut down
for two minutes, now.</i>


156
00:26:39.353 --> 00:26:41.276
- What about Control?
<i>- We still...</i>


157
00:26:41.438 --> 00:26:42.655
<i>...can't raise them.</i>

158
00:26:45.734 --> 00:26:48.953
I executed everyone
in this control room.


159
00:26:49.112 --> 00:26:51.285
I enabled Wesker
to hack the mainframe.


160
00:26:51.448 --> 00:26:54.292
We shut down the security systems.

161
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:56.044
We let you out of that cell.

162
00:26:56.203 --> 00:26:59.207
<i>We have to get you out
of this facility.</i>


163
00:26:59.373 --> 00:27:02.468
- So why do you want to help me?
<i>- We need you.</i>


164
00:27:02.626 --> 00:27:05.049
<i>The human race faces extinction.</i>

165
00:27:05.212 --> 00:27:08.762
<i>Our only hope of survival
is for us to work together.</i>


166
00:27:08.924 --> 00:27:10.141
I'm not going anywhere...

167
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.055
...until I know where we are
and what the hell is going on here.


168
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:16.644
<i>You're in the Prime Umbrella
testing facility.</i>


169
00:27:16.807 --> 00:27:18.605
Explain Tokyo.

170
00:27:18.767 --> 00:27:21.236
<i>What you saw was just
a detailed re-creation...</i>


171
00:27:21.395 --> 00:27:23.068
<i>...nothing more.</i>

172
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.528
<i>It goes on for a few city blocks.</i>

173
00:27:26.566 --> 00:27:27.533
<i>That's all.</i>

174
00:27:27.693 --> 00:27:29.195
I was outside.

175
00:27:29.361 --> 00:27:30.237
Were you?

176
00:27:30.862 --> 00:27:32.535
Saw the sky, did you?

177
00:27:32.698 --> 00:27:35.952
- It was night.
- Stars? The moon?


178
00:27:36.118 --> 00:27:41.340
<i>The testing floor is 300 feet high,
the ceiling black.</i>


179
00:27:41.498 --> 00:27:43.250
<i>It's usually night in there.</i>

180
00:27:43.417 --> 00:27:45.670
<i>But isn't that when
the monsters come out anyway?</i>


181
00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.639
- It was raining.
<i>- Climate control.</i>


182
00:27:48.797 --> 00:27:50.799
<i>Wind, rain...</i>

183
00:27:50.966 --> 00:27:53.094
<i>They can even make it snow
if they want to.</i>


184
00:27:53.593 --> 00:27:55.687
- Why build such a place?
<i>- Simple.</i>


185
00:27:56.054 --> 00:27:58.898
<i>The Umbrella Corporation
derived its primary income...</i>


186
00:27:59.057 --> 00:28:01.059
<i>...from the sale of viral weaponry...</i>

187
00:28:01.226 --> 00:28:04.573
<i>...something that's impossible
to test in the real world.</i>


188
00:28:04.946 --> 00:28:07.190
<i>They re-created the center
of New York...</i>


189
00:28:07.357 --> 00:28:10.281
<i>...simulated an outbreak,
showed it to the Russians...</i>


190
00:28:10.444 --> 00:28:12.572
<i>...and sold them the virus.</i>

191
00:28:12.738 --> 00:28:16.743
<i>They simulated an outbreak in Moscow,
sold it to the Americans.</i>


192
00:28:17.117 --> 00:28:18.243
<i>An outbreak in Tokyo.</i>

193
00:28:18.785 --> 00:28:20.128
Sold it to the Chinese.

194
00:28:20.287 --> 00:28:23.211
- An outbreak in China.
- Sold it to the Japanese.


195
00:28:23.373 --> 00:28:26.843
<i>Exactly. Everyone had to have it.</i>

196
00:28:27.002 --> 00:28:29.926
<i>The Umbrella Corporation
built a new arms race.</i>


197
00:28:30.088 --> 00:28:31.556
<i>Only, this time...</i>

198
00:28:31.715 --> 00:28:34.764
<i>...it was biological
rather than nuclear.</i>


199
00:28:34.926 --> 00:28:36.143
<i>Highly profitable.</i>

200
00:28:36.887 --> 00:28:39.140
<i>And this is where it all happened.</i>

201
00:28:39.306 --> 00:28:41.229
<i>This is Umbrella's greatest creation.</i>

202
00:28:42.851 --> 00:28:44.819
<i>The belly of the beast.</i>

203
00:28:44.978 --> 00:28:47.447
So why don't we
just get the hell out of here?


204
00:28:48.398 --> 00:28:49.445
Stop.

205
00:28:51.443 --> 00:28:53.161
Sunup is in less than a minute.

206
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:56.998
Why don't you just see
for yourself?


207
00:28:57.157 --> 00:28:59.956
<i>This facility is located
in the straits of Kamchatka...</i>


208
00:29:00.911 --> 00:29:04.006
<i>...northern Russia.
The old Soviet Union...</i>


209
00:29:04.164 --> 00:29:06.633
<i>...built submarine pens here
in the '80s.</i>


210
00:29:07.209 --> 00:29:08.631
<i>After the Cold War ended...</i>

211
00:29:09.544 --> 00:29:12.093
<i>...the Umbrella Corporation
expanded them...</i>


212
00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:14.804
<i>...and built the testing floor.</i>

213
00:29:18.095 --> 00:29:21.690
<i>No one has ever escaped
from this facility.</i>


214
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.852
Ice.

215
00:29:25.018 --> 00:29:27.191
<i>You'll need all the help you can get...</i>

216
00:29:27.354 --> 00:29:31.234
<i>...so I've arranged for a strike team
to enter from the surface and assist you.</i>


217
00:30:16.194 --> 00:30:17.662
There they are.

218
00:30:17.821 --> 00:30:20.415
Intake vents for the Umbrella facility.

219
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:24.248
Looks abandoned.

220
00:30:24.661 --> 00:30:26.288
That's what they want you to think.

221
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.549
Let's move.
We have just two hours...


222
00:30:29.708 --> 00:30:31.051
...to extract Alice and Ada.

223
00:30:31.209 --> 00:30:34.429
After that, we can expect
heavy Umbrella reinforcements.


224
00:30:47.017 --> 00:30:47.813
Running a bypass.

225
00:30:52.564 --> 00:30:54.487
These are the access codes
Ada gave us.


226
00:30:55.025 --> 00:30:55.867
Do you trust her?

227
00:30:56.026 --> 00:30:57.494
Just enter the numbers.

228
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.873
The charges are set.

229
00:31:08.205 --> 00:31:09.127
We're in.

230
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.353
Let's go do this.

231
00:31:28.433 --> 00:31:29.980
They're in.

232
00:31:30.143 --> 00:31:33.738
<i>The strike team has secured an elevator
for your escape to the surface.</i>


233
00:31:33.897 --> 00:31:35.865
They will eliminate Umbrella resistance...

234
00:31:36.024 --> 00:31:37.526
...then rendezvous with us...

235
00:31:37.692 --> 00:31:38.909
...and escort us out.

236
00:31:39.236 --> 00:31:41.659
They have a friend of yours with them.

237
00:31:41.821 --> 00:31:43.323
Luther West.

238
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.992
He's alive?

239
00:31:45.408 --> 00:31:47.661
All right. Hold on, ladies.

240
00:31:55.418 --> 00:31:59.093
Synchronize watches.
Two hours exactly in...


241
00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:01.975
...three, two, one, mark.

242
00:32:08.598 --> 00:32:09.770
Leon...

243
00:32:09.933 --> 00:32:11.814
Why don't we just trigger
the explosive remotely?


244
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.233
Can't risk them jamming the signal.

245
00:32:14.771 --> 00:32:18.992
And whether we succeed or not,
this facility has to be destroyed.


246
00:32:20.235 --> 00:32:22.329
What if we take longer than two hours?

247
00:32:22.487 --> 00:32:25.115
Then I hope you're really good
at holding your breath.


248
00:32:26.866 --> 00:32:30.871
<i>Security Chief Valentine
has reached the Tokyo test environment.</i>


249
00:32:31.037 --> 00:32:32.914
<i>She's tracking you.</i>

250
00:32:33.081 --> 00:32:34.708
They're headed this way.

251
00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:37.256
<i>Her orders are to recapture you...</i>

252
00:32:37.419 --> 00:32:38.545
<i>...if possible...</i>

253
00:32:38.712 --> 00:32:41.386
<i>...terminate you if necessary.</i>

254
00:32:41.548 --> 00:32:43.346
Who's giving these orders?

255
00:32:43.508 --> 00:32:44.634
<i>The Red Queen.</i>

256
00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:46.724
- The computer?
<i>- Yes.</i>


257
00:32:46.886 --> 00:32:50.356
<i>The same artificial intelligence
you encountered in the Hive.</i>


258
00:32:50.515 --> 00:32:53.860
<i>She now controls what remains
of the Umbrella Corporation.</i>


259
00:32:54.019 --> 00:32:57.319
<i>She will stop at nothing
to prevent you escaping to the surface.</i>


260
00:32:58.064 --> 00:33:00.321
<i>I've plotted an escape route for you.</i>

261
00:33:00.483 --> 00:33:03.236
<i>You'll cross the New York
environment to Suburbia...</i>


262
00:33:03.403 --> 00:33:05.622
<i>...where you'll rendezvous
with the strike team.</i>


263
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.659
<i>They'll escort you
through the Moscow environment...</i>


264
00:33:08.825 --> 00:33:10.827
<i>...to the submarine pens.</i>

265
00:33:10.994 --> 00:33:13.338
<i>And take the elevator
back to the surface.</i>


266
00:33:13.622 --> 00:33:16.125
<i>The Red Queen
has intercepted my signal.</i>


267
00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:19.215
<i>She's about to regain control
of this facility.</i>


268
00:33:19.377 --> 00:33:20.720
<i>You must hurry.
I can't...</i>


269
00:33:23.089 --> 00:33:24.932
<i>Don't listen to the traitor Wesker.</i>

270
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.223
<i>I am in control now.</i>

271
00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:28.386
<i>Project Alice...</i>

272
00:33:28.678 --> 00:33:29.520
<i>...Ada Wong...</i>

273
00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:31.101
...stay where you are.

274
00:33:31.473 --> 00:33:33.066
- Let's move.
<i>- Project Alice...</i>


275
00:33:35.226 --> 00:33:37.354
<i>You're all going to die down here.</i>

276
00:33:38.063 --> 00:33:40.191
I've heard that before.

277
00:34:02.045 --> 00:34:03.797
Defensive formation.

278
00:34:05.006 --> 00:34:05.973
Mark your targets.

279
00:34:06.341 --> 00:34:07.684
Fire at will.

280
00:34:24.025 --> 00:34:26.198
Submarine pens are up ahead.

281
00:34:28.822 --> 00:34:31.496
Barry, you and I take point.

282
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.004
We rendezvous with Alice and Ada
in 30 minutes.


283
00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:54.522
Clear.

284
00:35:01.688 --> 00:35:03.315
Now, that's some hardware.

285
00:35:03.481 --> 00:35:04.357
Typhoon class.

286
00:35:04.983 --> 00:35:07.907
The biggest nuclear subs
the Soviets ever built.


287
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:12.245
Umbrella used them to secretly transport
bioweapons all over the globe.


288
00:35:12.407 --> 00:35:15.206
<i>Let's pick up the pace.
We have less than 90 minutes.</i>


289
00:35:15.368 --> 00:35:17.166
<i>Intruders detected.</i>

290
00:35:17.328 --> 00:35:18.580
<i>Targeted for termination.</i>

291
00:35:23.626 --> 00:35:25.253
New York.

292
00:35:25.462 --> 00:35:28.922
We need to cross two more
test environments to escape.


293
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.141
Let's move.

294
00:35:30.216 --> 00:35:32.389
<i>Why would Umbrella continue
to run these tests?</i>


295
00:35:32.552 --> 00:35:36.022
<i>They want to study the biohazard,
learn how to control it.</i>


296
00:35:36.181 --> 00:35:38.934
<i>Initialize New York sequence.</i>

297
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.478
<i>Activate biohazard.</i>

298
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.110
<i>Stand by. Stand by.</i>

299
00:35:48.276 --> 00:35:51.371
<i>New York sequence initialized.</i>

300
00:35:51.529 --> 00:35:52.371
The Red Queen.

301
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.998
She's activating bioweapons
to stop us.


302
00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:56.165
Let's go.

303
00:35:56.201 --> 00:35:57.369
Wait.

304
00:35:58.286 --> 00:35:59.538
You hear that?

305
00:36:08.755 --> 00:36:09.756
You know what it is?

306
00:36:10.465 --> 00:36:12.012
I have an idea.

307
00:36:30.568 --> 00:36:32.613
Oh, you have got to
be kidding me.


308
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:06.876
Hey, boys.

309
00:38:09.542 --> 00:38:10.509
Bad idea.

310
00:38:30.688 --> 00:38:31.655
Let's move.

311
00:38:32.357 --> 00:38:34.451
We're behind schedule.

312
00:38:47.413 --> 00:38:48.960
What's going on?

313
00:38:49.123 --> 00:38:51.342
It's the end of the sequence.

314
00:38:51.501 --> 00:38:53.629
They rarely last more than an hour.

315
00:38:53.795 --> 00:38:55.092
Come on.

316
00:38:56.172 --> 00:38:59.016
<i>Before the Red Queen
activates something else.</i>


317
00:39:00.009 --> 00:39:02.228
<i>Targets survived.</i>

318
00:39:02.387 --> 00:39:05.266
<i>Security Chief Valentine to intercept.</i>

319
00:39:05.848 --> 00:39:08.897
<i>Intruders entering
Moscow test environment.</i>


320
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.813
<i>Activate Las Plagas Undead.</i>

321
00:39:22.115 --> 00:39:23.583
What's going on?

322
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:27.245
The Red Queen knows we're here.
Keep your eyes open.


323
00:39:27.412 --> 00:39:31.007
<i>Stand by. Stand by.</i>

324
00:39:31.165 --> 00:39:33.338
<i>Moscow sequence initialized.</i>

325
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.224
- What?
- Listen.


326
00:39:46.347 --> 00:39:47.228
Right there.

327
00:39:56.357 --> 00:39:58.155
What the hell are those things?

328
00:40:03.406 --> 00:40:05.625
Fall back!
Everyone, fall back!


329
00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:29.978
Clouds.

330
00:40:30.808 --> 00:40:32.310
They're not real.

331
00:40:32.477 --> 00:40:34.775
It's a holographic projection.

332
00:40:35.688 --> 00:40:37.782
When they were running
a simulation...


333
00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.285
...trust me,
no one was looking at the sky.


334
00:40:47.909 --> 00:40:49.536
This is the rendezvous point.

335
00:40:50.453 --> 00:40:51.875
The strike team is late.

336
00:40:52.747 --> 00:40:53.498
Where are they?

337
00:40:55.416 --> 00:40:58.010
There's movement
in the house behind you.


338
00:40:58.169 --> 00:41:00.046
Upstairs window.

339
00:41:24.362 --> 00:41:26.239
Why would they be in here?

340
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.082
They're using clones of me.

341
00:41:36.582 --> 00:41:37.834
Of course.

342
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.968
You were one of the 50 basic models.

343
00:41:42.213 --> 00:41:44.466
"Basic models."

344
00:41:44.632 --> 00:41:48.307
How do you think Umbrella
populates these test scenarios?


345
00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:50.471
Hundreds of people dead each time...

346
00:41:50.638 --> 00:41:51.855
...they run a simulation.

347
00:41:52.014 --> 00:41:55.109
Umbrella imprints them
with basic memories...


348
00:41:55.268 --> 00:41:58.272
...just enough to ensure
a correct emotional response...


349
00:41:58.437 --> 00:42:00.280
...to the threat of the biohazard.

350
00:42:00.815 --> 00:42:03.533
In one life, she could be
a suburban housewife.


351
00:42:03.693 --> 00:42:06.071
The next, a businesswoman
in New York.


352
00:42:06.237 --> 00:42:09.616
The next,
a soldier working for Umbrella.


353
00:43:29.948 --> 00:43:30.787
Mommy?

354
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.411
I hid like you told me.

355
00:43:37.745 --> 00:43:39.247
What happened to your clothes...

356
00:43:39.413 --> 00:43:40.790
...and your hair?

357
00:44:25.876 --> 00:44:27.219
RPG! Down!

358
00:44:32.133 --> 00:44:33.555
We're running out of time!

359
00:44:34.135 --> 00:44:36.183
You have to find
us a way out now!

360
00:44:36.971 --> 00:44:38.393
Almost there!

361
00:44:57.116 --> 00:44:58.618
None of this is real.

362
00:44:59.118 --> 00:45:00.961
- It is to her.
- I know.


363
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.246
That's the point.

364
00:45:02.413 --> 00:45:06.259
All these feelings she has for you,
they were imprinted.


365
00:45:07.668 --> 00:45:08.794
A day ago...

366
00:45:08.961 --> 00:45:10.759
...she was a blank slate.

367
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:14.221
I could show you a dozen
just like her in cold storage.


368
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.183
I'm sorry, but it's true.

369
00:45:18.637 --> 00:45:19.638
Ready.

370
00:45:19.805 --> 00:45:21.899
I was fast, wasn't I?

371
00:45:22.558 --> 00:45:24.060
Yes, you were.

372
00:45:53.297 --> 00:45:55.015
<i>- Daddy?
- He's not your father.</i>


373
00:45:55.174 --> 00:45:56.767
<i>Capture if possible.</i>

374
00:45:56.926 --> 00:45:58.894
<i>Terminate if necessary.</i>

375
00:46:00.596 --> 00:46:02.394
There's a child here.

376
00:46:02.556 --> 00:46:04.809
Your problem, not ours.

377
00:46:04.975 --> 00:46:08.149
All heart. You haven't changed a bit.

378
00:46:08.312 --> 00:46:10.360
I don't know you, lady.

379
00:46:10.523 --> 00:46:11.695
Now...

380
00:46:11.857 --> 00:46:14.576
Surrender or die.

381
00:46:27.456 --> 00:46:28.211
Stay down!

382
00:47:13.085 --> 00:47:14.177
Advance in teams!

383
00:47:14.336 --> 00:47:15.508
Yes, ma'am!

384
00:47:22.511 --> 00:47:24.312
You can't stay here!

385
00:47:24.805 --> 00:47:26.682
This will show you the way out.

386
00:47:27.266 --> 00:47:29.602
Go through Moscow to
the submarine pens.


387
00:47:30.352 --> 00:47:31.069
Take this.

388
00:47:32.229 --> 00:47:34.865
The less I have with me,
the better.


389
00:47:35.941 --> 00:47:37.818
Alpha Team forward!

390
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:01.766
They're coming. Hurry.

391
00:48:01.926 --> 00:48:03.178
Go.

392
00:48:53.227 --> 00:48:53.944
I've got it!

393
00:48:54.103 --> 00:48:54.854
This way!

394
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.538
Hey.

395
00:49:05.197 --> 00:49:06.073
Wait.

396
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.708
She helped us.
Don't you remember?


397
00:49:08.909 --> 00:49:10.081
You two made it!

398
00:49:12.871 --> 00:49:14.663
Thought I was the only one
that survived.


399
00:49:14.787 --> 00:49:17.795
What is this place,
and why is everything in Russian?


400
00:49:17.832 --> 00:49:20.755
And what's with the S & M getup?

401
00:49:21.714 --> 00:49:23.303
You know how to use this?

402
00:49:23.503 --> 00:49:25.642
I campaigned for gun control.

403
00:49:27.803 --> 00:49:30.852
No, I don't think you understand.
I marched against the NRA.


404
00:49:31.015 --> 00:49:32.562
Concentrate.

405
00:49:33.225 --> 00:49:35.023
It's just like a camera.

406
00:49:35.185 --> 00:49:37.938
Point and shoot.

407
00:49:41.567 --> 00:49:44.992
Congratulations.
You're officially a badass.


408
00:49:47.823 --> 00:49:49.450
What the hell's going on here?

409
00:49:49.992 --> 00:49:51.494
I'll explain when I get back.

410
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.003
You have to keep her safe.

411
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:56.002
- You stay with her.
- You're going?


412
00:49:56.165 --> 00:49:57.838
You said you wouldn't leave.

413
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.503
Trust me, okay? 
What I say is true.

414
00:50:00.669 --> 00:50:01.716
I'll come back for you.

415
00:50:01.879 --> 00:50:03.176
You promise?

416
00:50:03.339 --> 00:50:04.966
Trust me.

417
00:50:10.095 --> 00:50:11.563
I love you.

418
00:50:14.308 --> 00:50:15.025
Come on.

419
00:50:15.976 --> 00:50:17.603
She'll be back for you.

420
00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:19.272
Gotta find a hiding place.

421
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.074
- I met your sister.
- What?


422
00:50:22.232 --> 00:50:24.576
She's not very nice.

423
00:50:25.736 --> 00:50:27.488
Let's try hiding down here.

424
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.255
This way.

425
00:50:40.459 --> 00:50:41.676
Let's move!

426
00:50:43.212 --> 00:50:44.429
We can work our way around...

427
00:51:11.699 --> 00:51:13.326
Waiting for a written invitation?

428
00:51:23.669 --> 00:51:24.966
Sweet ride.

429
00:51:25.212 --> 00:51:27.510
Well, this is Moscow...

430
00:51:27.798 --> 00:51:30.611
Heard gunfire.
Thought you might need some help.


431
00:51:30.738 --> 00:51:31.676
Where's Ada?

432
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.563
I don't think she made it.

433
00:51:34.847 --> 00:51:36.270
I'm sorry.

434
00:51:36.565 --> 00:51:37.854
You saw her die?

435
00:51:38.267 --> 00:51:39.063
No.

436
00:51:40.188 --> 00:51:41.945
She always has a plan.

437
00:52:20.893 --> 00:52:22.987
Boys, you mind?

438
00:52:23.604 --> 00:52:25.572
- Shall we?
- My pleasure.


439
00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:59.098
Let me know when you plan
on doing that again.


440
00:53:05.229 --> 00:53:06.196
Heads up.

441
00:53:42.766 --> 00:53:44.894
Our little friend is back!

442
00:53:45.394 --> 00:53:46.361
Oh, shit.

443
00:53:51.108 --> 00:53:52.530
- Almost there.
- No.


444
00:53:52.776 --> 00:53:54.449
Wait, wait, wait...
You're not going down there!


445
00:54:36.987 --> 00:54:37.704
Everyone okay?

446
00:54:39.865 --> 00:54:40.616
Yeah.

447
00:54:40.949 --> 00:54:42.121
All right, let's go.

448
00:54:44.912 --> 00:54:46.038
Hello?

449
00:54:46.955 --> 00:54:48.548
You can come out.

450
00:54:49.833 --> 00:54:50.800
I'm back.

451
00:54:56.673 --> 00:54:58.175
Where'd you find these guys?

452
00:55:00.135 --> 00:55:01.136
Who's this?

453
00:55:01.595 --> 00:55:02.812
I'm Becky.

454
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:04.647
Hi, Becky.

455
00:55:04.848 --> 00:55:06.316
This is my mom.

456
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.147
Your mom?

457
00:55:09.686 --> 00:55:10.938
Long story.

458
00:55:12.773 --> 00:55:13.950
Twenty-two minutes left!

459
00:55:14.772 --> 00:55:16.574
There's no going back
the way we came.


460
00:55:16.607 --> 00:55:18.446
Yeah, we lost our map with Sergei.

461
00:55:18.737 --> 00:55:19.704
I'm on it.

462
00:55:33.001 --> 00:55:34.423
We can take this tunnel.

463
00:55:34.586 --> 00:55:37.929
At the end there's a service shaft
that leads down to the submarine pens.


464
00:55:38.256 --> 00:55:39.508
Let's go.

465
00:56:04.992 --> 00:56:07.040
How'd you end up
working for Wesker?


466
00:56:07.202 --> 00:56:08.795
I don't work for him...

467
00:56:08.954 --> 00:56:10.877
...but things on the surface
have changed.


468
00:56:11.289 --> 00:56:13.462
Wesker said you knew
of some weapon...


469
00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:16.719
...something that could
turn the tide for us.


470
00:56:17.337 --> 00:56:20.758
But I don't think I would have
risked so much for one person.


471
00:56:22.426 --> 00:56:24.053
You're probably right.

472
00:56:24.219 --> 00:56:25.516
This way.

473
00:56:26.892 --> 00:56:28.765
The submarine pens
are up above us.


474
00:56:29.641 --> 00:56:31.063
Come on. Move.

475
00:56:50.579 --> 00:56:53.458
The elevator platforms are up ahead.

476
00:56:53.623 --> 00:56:54.714
Eleven minutes.

477
00:56:55.292 --> 00:56:57.511
- We're gonna be okay.
- Hold on.


478
00:56:59.463 --> 00:57:02.262
<i>Eleven minutes.
We're gonna be okay.</i>


479
00:57:02.424 --> 00:57:05.268
<i>- Hold on.
- Accessing power grid.</i>


480
00:57:05.427 --> 00:57:07.395
<i>Dispatching biohazard.</i>

481
00:57:13.018 --> 00:57:14.611
Everybody get on board.

482
00:57:18.398 --> 00:57:20.776
Hold on. Next stop...

483
00:57:20.942 --> 00:57:23.365
...menswear and sporting goods.

484
00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:31.501
Move down!

485
00:57:32.788 --> 00:57:34.836
- Barry, what is it?
- I don't know.


486
00:57:35.624 --> 00:57:36.546
Where are you going?

487
00:57:36.708 --> 00:57:38.585
Somebody must've
cut the power remotely.


488
00:57:41.838 --> 00:57:43.556
Be strong.

489
00:57:43.715 --> 00:57:45.058
I'm gonna keep you safe.

490
00:57:55.435 --> 00:57:56.436
Can you get it back online?

491
00:57:56.603 --> 00:57:58.568
Not without the access codes.

492
00:58:02.025 --> 00:58:04.528
Nine minutes.
Looks like we're going with plan B.


493
00:58:05.487 --> 00:58:06.659
What?

494
00:58:06.822 --> 00:58:08.995
There's a reason
we planted those explosives.


495
00:58:18.875 --> 00:58:19.756
No!

496
00:58:25.006 --> 00:58:26.055
Mommy!

497
00:58:28.093 --> 00:58:29.970
Mommy!

498
00:58:36.226 --> 00:58:37.148
I feel like shit.

499
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.237
She's dead.

500
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.419
- What are you doing?
- She's alive.


501
00:58:54.578 --> 00:58:55.795
I'm going to get her.

502
00:58:55.954 --> 00:58:58.981
I didn't lose this many friends
so you could just walk away.


503
00:58:58.982 --> 00:59:00.671
I plan on coming back.

504
00:59:01.877 --> 00:59:03.220
Don't do this.

505
00:59:03.378 --> 00:59:05.304
You're more important than she is.

506
00:59:05.463 --> 00:59:07.386
That's where you're wrong.

507
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:08.971
This is a mistake.

508
00:59:09.384 --> 00:59:11.136
Get out of my way.

509
00:59:20.395 --> 00:59:22.238
Don't leave without me, okay?

510
00:59:22.397 --> 00:59:24.491
Are you kidding me?
I'm going with you.


511
00:59:32.032 --> 00:59:33.705
Don't move. Don't move.

512
00:59:33.867 --> 00:59:34.868
It's okay.

513
00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:36.502
Go get her back.

514
01:00:05.148 --> 01:00:07.196
You like that?!

515
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:45.757
Move up!

516
01:01:54.341 --> 01:01:55.593
Fall back to the elevator!

517
01:01:56.843 --> 01:01:57.682
You go!

518
01:01:58.803 --> 01:02:00.055
I'm gonna stay here a while.

519
01:02:00.221 --> 01:02:01.643
Barry.

520
01:02:01.806 --> 01:02:04.150
When the countdown
gets down to zero...


521
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:06.232
...you have to be on that elevator!

522
01:02:06.394 --> 01:02:07.566
Someone's got to
stay here Leon!


523
01:02:08.895 --> 01:02:10.023
Besides...

524
01:02:13.443 --> 01:02:15.445
...I'm kind of enjoying myself!

525
01:02:19.657 --> 01:02:22.126
Go. Go!

526
01:02:22.952 --> 01:02:24.704
Come on!

527
01:03:49.747 --> 01:03:51.499
Oh, Becky. Becky.

528
01:04:07.182 --> 01:04:07.937
Go!

529
01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:35.130
Bring out the prisoner!

530
01:04:44.511 --> 01:04:45.683
Cease your firing.

531
01:04:46.679 --> 01:04:48.147
Or I'll execute her.

532
01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:51.101
Now...

533
01:04:52.227 --> 01:04:54.104
Throw down your guns...

534
01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:55.362
...and step out.

535
01:04:56.105 --> 01:04:58.533
Step out or she dies!

536
01:06:19.314 --> 01:06:20.361
Mommy, who are they?

537
01:06:25.903 --> 01:06:26.654
Who are they?

538
01:06:31.326 --> 01:06:32.202
Mommy, is that you?

539
01:06:47.091 --> 01:06:48.434
You're my mommy, aren't you?

540
01:06:48.968 --> 01:06:50.265
I am now.

541
01:07:56.786 --> 01:07:57.628
Move!

542
01:09:02.894 --> 01:09:04.362
Choppers are on their way...

543
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.148
...so just sit back and relax.

544
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.812
What's going on?

545
01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:53.444
What the hell is that?

546
01:10:04.288 --> 01:10:05.665
Becky, are you hurt?

547
01:10:05.832 --> 01:10:07.300
No. I'm okay.

548
01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:27.629
Told you she'd have a plan.

549
01:11:33.002 --> 01:11:34.629
Only the two of you?

550
01:11:34.795 --> 01:11:36.547
It'll be enough.

551
01:11:41.385 --> 01:11:43.387
The Las Plagas parasite.

552
01:16:41.018 --> 01:16:42.770
<i>Terminate Project Alice.</i>

553
01:19:14.004 --> 01:19:14.757
Alice!

554
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:32.898
You can't kill me.

555
01:19:33.065 --> 01:19:34.658
I don't need to.

556
01:20:19.611 --> 01:20:21.158
I'm coming for you!

557
01:20:21.905 --> 01:20:23.282
Good luck with that.

558
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:50.817
Leon.

559
01:21:04.239 --> 01:21:05.491
What is it?

560
01:21:05.657 --> 01:21:06.749
It's help.

561
01:22:15.394 --> 01:22:16.737
Glad to have you back.

562
01:22:18.772 --> 01:22:21.070
Glad to have you back.

563
01:22:55.434 --> 01:22:56.936
I don't care.

564
01:23:26.965 --> 01:23:27.761
Wesker.

565
01:23:29.301 --> 01:23:31.554
I see you've made yourself at home.

566
01:23:32.888 --> 01:23:34.481
Well, I must say...

567
01:23:35.223 --> 01:23:37.976
...it does have a certain ease to it.

568
01:23:53.659 --> 01:23:54.933
What is this?

569
01:23:55.774 --> 01:23:57.417
What have you done to me?

570
01:23:59.706 --> 01:24:00.878
You were the only one...

571
01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:04.090
...to successfully bond
with the T-Virus...


572
01:24:04.878 --> 01:24:07.301
...to fully realize her powers.

573
01:24:08.048 --> 01:24:09.721
Well, now I have need of you.

574
01:24:10.175 --> 01:24:11.722
The old you.

575
01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:14.854
So I've given you back your gift.

576
01:24:15.013 --> 01:24:16.606
You are...

577
01:24:16.765 --> 01:24:18.267
...the weapon.

578
01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:26.363
I'm gonna kill you.

579
01:24:27.275 --> 01:24:28.492
Perhaps.

580
01:24:29.528 --> 01:24:32.247
But first, you have work to do.

581
01:24:35.367 --> 01:24:39.543
The Red Queen is determined
to destroy all life on earth.


582
01:24:39.705 --> 01:24:43.505
This is the last that remain of us,
of the human race.


583
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:48.343
It seems we're bonded
against a common foe.


584
01:24:48.505 --> 01:24:52.351
This is why we needed you back.
The ultimate weapon.


585
01:24:57.848 --> 01:25:00.818
This is humanity's last stand.

586
01:25:00.976 --> 01:25:03.570
The beginning of the end.

587
01:35:36.176 --> 01:35:36.970
.
