1
00:02:11.654 --> 00:02:14.714
Mrs. Li? You're so beautiful.

2
00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:17.520
They say your dumplings
are the most expensive.


3
00:02:17.627 --> 00:02:20.289
Of course! Please come in.

4
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:23.599
You've come at the right time!

5
00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.930
The water is just boiling,
waiting for you.


6
00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.669
Actually, I know who you are.

7
00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:39.976
I watched you on TV very often
when I first came to Hong Kong.


8
00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:41.344
You were the best!

9
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.509
I quit acting a long time ago.

10
00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:50.122
Please, have a seat.

11
00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:52.217
Mrs. Li, guess how old I am.

12
00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.158
I suppose...

13
00:03:02.271 --> 00:03:04.239
you're in your thirties at most.

14
00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.770
I'm much older than that.
Everyone calls me Aunt Mei.


15
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.677
But you don't have any wrinkles.

16
00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:18.276
And I have fair skin, too.

17
00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:21.879
I'm my own best advertisement.

18
00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:25.951
Your skin is great. 
I'm impressed.

19
00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:33.902
My dumplings are worth it.
You get what you pay for.


20
00:04:25.388 --> 00:04:27.856
Mrs. Li...

21
00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:30.550
Want me to put in more cabbage?

22
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.787
It's up to you.

23
00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:34.453
The Northerners always say,

24
00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:38.624
"Good feeling comes from a nap.
Good taste comes from a dumpling."


25
00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:41.703
Dumplings have existed in China
for more than 1400 years.


26
00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:45.604
But the Southerners still say

27
00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:50.111
they're just dough stuffed
with meat, nothing special!


28
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.648
I use high-gluten flour
for texture and chewiness.


29
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.359
I knead it fine until
it's like a peeled egg.


30
00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:15.460
Smooth, translucent and soft.

31
00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:23.476
That's the secret to keep
the filling from leaking out.


32
00:06:06.188 --> 00:06:13.026
So that the juicy flavor explodes
in the mouth, eat while it's warm.


33
00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:14.960
I eat these often.

34
00:06:15.064 --> 00:06:21.230
Sometimes in soup, sometimes minced
and steamed with citrus peel.


35
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.984
Just think of the results,
not what it was.


36
00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:02.373
For women to rejuvenate, you must start
from inside for the best result.


37
00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:08.641
Only my secret formula can do this.

38
00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:15.953
Let me sing for you.

39
00:07:16.058 --> 00:07:18.993
Well, it's kind of a custom of mine.

40
00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:21.928
I often sing songs from my youth
when my customers eat.


41
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:25.296
Take it as entertainment.
Listen.


42
00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:36.637
The water of Hung Lake is rough

43
00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:44.584
My home is on the shore

44
00:07:44.687 --> 00:07:52.719
At dawn, boats go out with nets

45
00:07:52.828 --> 00:08:02.828
At dusk, they return loaded with fish

46
00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:12.938
Wild ducks and lotus roots are here

47
00:08:13.048 --> 00:08:20.147
Autumns are bountiful with rice

48
00:08:20.256 --> 00:08:24.852
They say heaven is beautiful

49
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.729
How can it compare with Hung Lake

50
00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:26.283
You were already on a trip last week.

51
00:09:26.388 --> 00:09:28.822
You promised to stay
for our 15th anniversary.


52
00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:33.089
I'm just going for a few days.
I'll try to come back early.


53
00:09:33.195 --> 00:09:38.098
It's boring here in the hotel.

54
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.658
We'll move into our new home
as soon as the renovation is over.


55
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:52.046
See if there's anything else
we need in the new house.


56
00:09:54.383 --> 00:09:56.647
So many zeroes?

57
00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:00.149
You used to laugh a lot.

58
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.556
Now even a big fat check
can't make you happy?


59
00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:06.822
You're not taking me along.

60
00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:09.625
Why should I be happy?

61
00:10:09.732 --> 00:10:13.361
- I'll be gone for only four or five days.
- And if not?


62
00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:18.296
I'll write you another check as a fine.

63
00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:21.468
Fines are for mistakes.

64
00:10:22.278 --> 00:10:23.836
Whatever.

65
00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:31.417
About that contract... If you don't send it
over soon, I'm going to change my mind.


66
00:10:46.001 --> 00:10:49.164
I went through so much to get these.

67
00:10:49.271 --> 00:10:52.536
- They're stepping up the surveillance.
- Because some paparazzi have come.


68
00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:54.233
Hong Kong media is so nosy.

69
00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:57.341
Just don't show up
in the next two weeks.


70
00:10:57.446 --> 00:10:59.676
Even the locals can't get
hold of the stock now.


71
00:10:59.782 --> 00:11:01.306
We'll see.

72
00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:04.409
- Thanks.
- This is for you.


73
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.422
This way, miss.
This way, miss.


74
00:11:13.962 --> 00:11:15.953
- Put it through
- Over there?


75
00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:18.363
- The lunchbox
- Okay.


76
00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:42.915
Mrs. Li.

77
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.988
Ever consider having children?

78
00:11:48.697 --> 00:11:51.598
We just can't. I don't know
if it's his problem or mine.


79
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.227
Don't worry!
You'll soon regain your youth,


80
00:11:56.271 --> 00:11:58.899
as well as the heart of your man.

81
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:15.122
Do you have more potent stuff
for faster results?


82
00:12:16.825 --> 00:12:20.261
The best are those
in the fifth or sixth month.


83
00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:24.264
You have to remove it only by breaking
the water sac, then sliding it out.


84
00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:27.460
It's covered by a layer of creamy fat.

85
00:12:27.569 --> 00:12:31.027
The colors are defined.
You can even see the cranium.


86
00:12:32.474 --> 00:12:35.034
Its tiny limbs will
still be moving around.


87
00:12:37.146 --> 00:12:39.774
It's only this big
in the first trimester.


88
00:12:39.882 --> 00:12:44.046
But the meat will be tough
by the third trimester.


89
00:12:44.153 --> 00:12:47.554
The fifth-month ones
are perfect, kitten-like.


90
00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:50.124
So cute and so nutritious.

91
00:12:50.826 --> 00:12:52.589
Let me show you.

92
00:13:23.592 --> 00:13:26.152
I'm serving it pan-fried this time.

93
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:29.662
We can always try some
other styles next time.


94
00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:36.632
What's this crunchiness about?

95
00:13:36.738 --> 00:13:41.971
It's okay. They have hands and feet
already, you know, and ears, too!


96
00:13:42.077 --> 00:13:43.544
Those were bones?

97
00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:49.550
Nah... their bones are hardly hard.
I'll just chop finer next time.


98
00:13:49.651 --> 00:13:52.643
Simmer in broth next time.
It'll taste less greasy.


99
00:13:52.754 --> 00:13:55.951
Broth is good.
It keeps all the juices.


100
00:13:56.992 --> 00:13:58.550
Are you done?

101
00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:15.741
- This can't go on.
- Pardon?


102
00:14:16.778 --> 00:14:19.246
My skin is still flabby.

103
00:14:25.287 --> 00:14:27.255
No! It's much better!

104
00:14:27.356 --> 00:14:30.189
I need your most potent stuff.

105
00:14:30.292 --> 00:14:32.487
Trust me, I'll find it.

106
00:14:32.594 --> 00:14:34.459
It's time for me to sing.

107
00:14:35.497 --> 00:14:39.297
- Suit yourself, but I must go.
- Bye, Mrs. Li.


108
00:14:40.602 --> 00:14:42.069
This way!

109
00:14:43.171 --> 00:14:46.629
- Don't worry, I'll find it for you.
- Call me when you do.


110
00:14:46.742 --> 00:14:48.733
Trust me.

111
00:14:51.113 --> 00:14:52.978
Aunt Mei?

112
00:14:53.081 --> 00:14:55.572
- You are?
- I'm a friend of Mrs. Kam.


113
00:14:55.684 --> 00:14:58.380
Oh, come on in!
Hello, dear.


114
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.974
From now on, you don't
have to work anymore.


115
00:15:20.075 --> 00:15:21.303
And live off you?

116
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.641
I can afford that, given you're
so slim and eat so little.


117
00:15:24.746 --> 00:15:28.580
- Not true. I love eating.
- And you like to laugh, too.


118
00:15:35.724 --> 00:15:36.850
Relax.

119
00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:41.555
You're almost there.
It's been 18 hours already.


120
00:15:41.663 --> 00:15:42.630
Relax.

121
00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:45.165
You must try to relax, dear.

122
00:15:45.267 --> 00:15:47.565
Will she be all right?

123
00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:49.261
Of course.

124
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:50.838
Try to relax.

125
00:15:53.175 --> 00:15:55.268
Your cervix has not fully dilated yet.

126
00:15:55.377 --> 00:15:58.073
Poor girl, you're not even fully grown.

127
00:16:01.683 --> 00:16:05.517
We women must defend ourselves.
Don't let others bully you again.


128
00:16:07.889 --> 00:16:09.151
The water broke!

129
00:16:13.595 --> 00:16:15.392
- It's okay.
- Don't be nervous.


130
00:16:16.264 --> 00:16:19.358
I swear it will be over in seconds.

131
00:16:19.468 --> 00:16:21.527
Breathe deeply!

132
00:16:21.637 --> 00:16:24.868
Work with me, okay? Relax.

133
00:16:24.973 --> 00:16:26.440
Hold on...

134
00:16:30.045 --> 00:16:32.275
Relax...

135
00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:34.611
Cry if you want to.

136
00:16:34.716 --> 00:16:36.650
It's fully dilated!

137
00:16:36.752 --> 00:16:38.549
Stay calm! And on my count...

138
00:16:38.654 --> 00:16:41.020
One, two, three!

139
00:16:43.158 --> 00:16:44.682
Where are my tongs?

140
00:16:45.594 --> 00:16:47.084
Relax!

141
00:16:58.807 --> 00:17:00.798
Try to relax.

142
00:17:08.517 --> 00:17:10.417
Beautiful.

143
00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:13.010
Don't be sad, my dear.

144
00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:15.282
There's no more life in this baby.

145
00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:44.384
Want some snacks?
I'll do steamed dumplings this time.


146
00:17:46.822 --> 00:17:49.154
Need some wine, too.

147
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.518
It was a boy.

148
00:20:07.662 --> 00:20:09.129
A boy?

149
00:20:11.466 --> 00:20:14.128
See that little thing?

150
00:20:16.938 --> 00:20:18.997
So beautiful and rare.

151
00:20:19.107 --> 00:20:22.440
Boys don't get aborted in China.

152
00:20:22.544 --> 00:20:25.240
I didn't use any oxytocin,
just a catheter.


153
00:20:25.347 --> 00:20:30.944
Drugs make it inedible.
It'll damage your nervous system.


154
00:20:31.052 --> 00:20:32.986
It's a first-born,
the most nutritious.


155
00:20:33.088 --> 00:20:35.420
Nothing in the world
can beat this nutrition.


156
00:20:35.523 --> 00:20:41.462
The mother's a schoolgirl...
young and healthy.


157
00:20:41.563 --> 00:20:43.190
Then get working!

158
00:20:44.232 --> 00:20:45.426
What's the style today?

159
00:21:59.874 --> 00:22:04.436
This will make you
feel like new, I promise.


160
00:22:24.165 --> 00:22:25.359
Hello?

161
00:22:40.782 --> 00:22:42.249
My husband broke his leg.

162
00:23:24.426 --> 00:23:28.362
Now you need me.

163
00:23:30.498 --> 00:23:34.594
Normally you wouldn't
even care where I go.


164
00:24:03.398 --> 00:24:04.990
You smell nice...

165
00:24:09.671 --> 00:24:11.730
...look nice.

166
00:24:13.274 --> 00:24:15.435
You haven't held me in ages.

167
00:24:25.553 --> 00:24:29.683
Thirsty? I'll get water.

168
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.245
It's so hot in the street.

169
00:27:07.348 --> 00:27:10.875
And we must go to Mongkok next.

170
00:27:10.985 --> 00:27:13.146
Darn! I forgot about that.

171
00:27:13.254 --> 00:27:14.380
Two more trunks to move.

172
00:27:14.489 --> 00:27:17.822
- Woe is me.
- Big trunks, too.


173
00:27:17.925 --> 00:27:19.358
What the hell?

174
00:27:21.296 --> 00:27:23.059
- What's this?
- What is it?


175
00:27:23.164 --> 00:27:26.190
- It's blood.
- My goodness!


176
00:27:27.468 --> 00:27:28.867
Here's a tissue.

177
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.437
Whose blood is this?

178
00:27:30.538 --> 00:27:33.200
Kate? Are you all right?

179
00:27:33.308 --> 00:27:35.799
Kate, what's going on?

180
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.710
Answer me, Kate! Answer me!

181
00:27:39.814 --> 00:27:43.910
Kate? You all right?
What's going on?


182
00:27:44.952 --> 00:27:47.386
Something is going on here.

183
00:27:47.488 --> 00:27:49.718
- She must have taken something.
- Definitely.


184
00:27:49.824 --> 00:27:51.758
Mrs. Li.

185
00:27:51.859 --> 00:27:54.350
You look fabulous!
Absolutely radiant!


186
00:27:55.563 --> 00:27:58.259
- Talking behind my back?
- No!


187
00:27:58.366 --> 00:28:00.129
Just praising you.

188
00:28:00.234 --> 00:28:01.997
I'll catch up later.

189
00:28:03.838 --> 00:28:06.204
You're so late.

190
00:28:08.309 --> 00:28:13.008
Perhaps she found herself a guru,
or better, voodoo.


191
00:28:13.114 --> 00:28:14.809
That's scary!

192
00:28:16.884 --> 00:28:22.049
Mrs. Li, stop busying yourself.
Join us.


193
00:28:23.091 --> 00:28:24.854
- Bon appetite.
- Thanks.


194
00:28:24.959 --> 00:28:27.325
The food smells kind of fishy.

195
00:28:27.929 --> 00:28:29.328
Yes.

196
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.297
- Is it the beef?
- The beef?


197
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.960
It's the fish, I think.

198
00:28:35.069 --> 00:28:36.764
Really?

199
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:39.169
I don't think so.

200
00:28:39.273 --> 00:28:42.367
There's a strange smell here.

201
00:28:43.478 --> 00:28:46.072
Something wrong with the food?

202
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.115
God, the smell is horrible.

203
00:28:52.653 --> 00:28:55.087
I've forgot to check something.
Excuse me.


204
00:28:56.991 --> 00:29:00.620
She's off again!
Why is she so tense?


205
00:29:32.794 --> 00:29:34.728
Aunt Mei?

206
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.964
What was this "best stuff"?

207
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.399
What did you feed me?

208
00:29:40.501 --> 00:29:42.469
The fetus was sick, wasn't it?
Or poisonous?


209
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.266
This baby was hard to find.

210
00:29:45.373 --> 00:29:50.106
Available only because his father
was also his grandfather.


211
00:29:50.211 --> 00:29:51.838
One in a million, you know.

212
00:29:51.946 --> 00:29:53.106
A child of incest?

213
00:29:53.915 --> 00:29:56.281
A cursed child turns me into this?

214
00:29:57.318 --> 00:30:00.048
A cursed child has extra potency,

215
00:30:00.154 --> 00:30:01.678
I tell you.

216
00:30:03.224 --> 00:30:05.385
Hey! Mrs. Li, Hurry!

217
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:10.057
Turn on the TV.
Channel 2 is rerunning your series!


218
00:30:19.373 --> 00:30:22.570
Heard you have a crush on someone
from the neighborhood boys school.


219
00:30:22.677 --> 00:30:24.008
No...

220
00:30:24.111 --> 00:30:25.578
- You sure?
- No...


221
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.580
The one you said looks like Alan Tam.

222
00:30:29.484 --> 00:30:31.952
I never said so!

223
00:30:32.053 --> 00:30:34.317
Mrs. Li, you crying?

224
00:30:35.356 --> 00:30:38.291
Don't be sad. Be strong.

225
00:30:38.392 --> 00:30:40.417
Good night, Mrs. Li.

226
00:31:24.238 --> 00:31:27.401
Headaches? And rashes?

227
00:31:27.508 --> 00:31:31.376
It's just nerves.
You should be happy instead.


228
00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:35.882
You're two months pregnant!
We've confirmed it.


229
00:31:36.918 --> 00:31:39.716
- You sure?
- Definitely.


230
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.220
Peter, you told me I couldn't conceive!

231
00:31:42.323 --> 00:31:45.121
Not anymore! Now you can!

232
00:31:45.226 --> 00:31:47.922
- You sure there's no mistake?
- Not a chance.


233
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:52.523
This is the best news
for both Mr. Li and you!


234
00:31:52.633 --> 00:31:55.329
I'll prescribe you something
to ease your tension.


235
00:31:55.436 --> 00:31:57.563
You'll be fine in a couple of days.

236
00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:06.843
- Nurse.
- Yes, Dr. Wong?


237
00:32:06.948 --> 00:32:10.543
Mrs. Li's chauffeur will
come pick up her medication.


238
00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:12.243
How many days' prescription?

239
00:32:12.353 --> 00:32:15.982
- Give her a week's worth.
- Okay.


240
00:32:41.616 --> 00:32:43.140
Don't move!

241
00:32:46.354 --> 00:32:49.414
Dispatch, we've arrived at 2103.

242
00:32:49.523 --> 00:32:53.892
Victim is male, badly cut.
We need an ambulance.


243
00:32:53.995 --> 00:32:56.691
We have his wife under control.

244
00:33:14.115 --> 00:33:15.582
Tell them to hurry.

245
00:33:15.683 --> 00:33:18.709
The victim is still alive!

246
00:33:50.017 --> 00:33:51.780
So much stuff left.

247
00:33:53.554 --> 00:33:56.682
What are these...
so well-hidden?


248
00:38:50.818 --> 00:38:52.683
Hello?

249
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:56.121
Just a minute.

250
00:38:58.425 --> 00:38:59.892
There, all right.

251
00:39:00.928 --> 00:39:02.896
No, I'm not busy.

252
00:39:02.997 --> 00:39:05.158
I was just having dinner.

253
00:39:06.567 --> 00:39:09.297
Have you eaten?

254
00:39:09.403 --> 00:39:14.966
I can't finish it.
Yeah, I've left it frozen.


255
00:39:18.479 --> 00:39:21.812
My stomach doesn't feel so good.

256
00:39:24.184 --> 00:39:25.617
Anyway...

257
00:39:25.719 --> 00:39:28.153
it's been months
since I moved here.


258
00:39:28.255 --> 00:39:30.348
Aren't you going to come over?

259
00:39:30.457 --> 00:39:32.288
How about tomorrow?

260
00:39:32.393 --> 00:39:35.089
We can have breakfast together...

261
00:39:35.195 --> 00:39:37.686
if you don't mind cold leftovers.

262
00:39:41.869 --> 00:39:44.394
You really want to hear me play?

263
00:40:12.466 --> 00:40:14.957
My stomach is really bothering me!

264
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:17.162
I feel nauseous!

265
00:40:18.672 --> 00:40:21.072
Perhaps the food is past
its expiration date.


266
00:40:31.351 --> 00:40:34.377
Darling, it's killing me!

267
00:41:23.437 --> 00:41:26.201
And...

268
00:41:26.874 --> 00:41:28.341
cut.

269
00:41:31.411 --> 00:41:32.673
20...

270
00:41:32.779 --> 00:41:36.078
What's scene 29 again?

271
00:41:36.183 --> 00:41:38.743
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.


272
00:41:40.787 --> 00:41:44.518
Scene 29 is where Young-Chae
draws blood with a water pump.


273
00:41:44.625 --> 00:41:47.059
- Right.
- If we push it back to the 13th,


274
00:41:47.161 --> 00:41:50.255
shoot the inserts for scene 8 and 9
during the morning of the eighth,


275
00:41:50.364 --> 00:41:52.093
and I'll finish editing
before the night shoot.


276
00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:54.167
Then the crew can catch
some sleep in between.


277
00:41:54.268 --> 00:41:56.133
But you won't get any sleep at all.

278
00:41:56.236 --> 00:41:58.898
Better just one, than all 60
of the crew losing sleep.


279
00:41:59.006 --> 00:42:00.530
Quite true.

280
00:42:00.641 --> 00:42:03.201
- Take care, sir.
- Yeah, you too.


281
00:42:03.744 --> 00:42:06.269
Kyung-ah, get the guys
to do the heavy work!


282
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.779
I heard you're going to Seoul.

283
00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:09.781
- Could you drop me off at Hanam City?
- Sure.


284
00:42:09.883 --> 00:42:12.750
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye.


285
00:42:12.853 --> 00:42:15.321
Sir... the daggers we talked about.

286
00:42:18.158 --> 00:42:18.920
Good work.

287
00:42:20.127 --> 00:42:21.526
Good work, everyone!

288
00:42:24.298 --> 00:42:28.758
I ran over from Studio 3
as soon as I heard you were here.


289
00:42:28.869 --> 00:42:32.100
Did you read the scripts I sent you?

290
00:42:32.206 --> 00:42:34.731
What do you think?
Which one should I do?


291
00:42:34.841 --> 00:42:36.741
"Pink Panty."
Go for "Pink Panty."


292
00:42:36.843 --> 00:42:39.607
They say Director Jang
is the John Waters of Korea.


293
00:42:39.713 --> 00:42:42.739
Still... don't you think his
film is a little sinister?


294
00:42:42.849 --> 00:42:47.809
- Kim Chang's film seems better.
- Director Kim Chang...


295
00:42:47.921 --> 00:42:50.583
His film only makes
the director look good.


296
00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:53.819
The actors don't get noticed at all.

297
00:42:53.927 --> 00:42:56.760
Just don't waste your time on him.

298
00:42:56.863 --> 00:42:58.524
What about this?

299
00:42:58.632 --> 00:43:01.328
Trying something other
than Mr. Nice Guy?


300
00:43:01.435 --> 00:43:04.700
Like a psycho-rapist-killer thing... huh?

301
00:43:05.906 --> 00:43:06.565
Huh?

302
00:43:07.674 --> 00:43:11.371
Don't worry, I ate already.
Just go back to your work.


303
00:43:12.412 --> 00:43:14.471
We can have breakfast
together tomorrow.


304
00:43:14.581 --> 00:43:17.379
I'll take care of it if you
don't mind cold leftovers.


305
00:43:18.885 --> 00:43:22.981
You should have come to see the set!
It looks just like our house.


306
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.991
Hey, I got the music for the film!
Listen to this.


307
00:44:53.547 --> 00:44:56.778
THE REHEARSAL WILL END LATE!
DON'T FORGET YOUR VEGGIE DIET!


308
00:46:52.666 --> 00:46:54.861
You've got...

309
00:46:56.236 --> 00:46:58.761
such pretty hands, ma'am.

310
00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:08.707
There's jewelry in the bedroom.

311
00:47:08.815 --> 00:47:11.306
Take it all. Just don't hurt anyone.

312
00:47:11.418 --> 00:47:13.147
Please, let us go!

313
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:25.898
Darn.

314
00:47:26.733 --> 00:47:30.863
You're not supposed to start off
with this kind of talk!


315
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:35.340
You shouldn't have started begging...

316
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:40.510
until like 20 minutes later.

317
00:47:40.614 --> 00:47:43.742
Wait till things fall apart first!

318
00:47:44.784 --> 00:47:48.880
You are, after all,
the head of the house.


319
00:47:48.989 --> 00:47:53.119
If you're only capable of
begging from the onset,


320
00:47:53.226 --> 00:47:56.218
who else could your wife count on?

321
00:47:59.165 --> 00:48:04.569
Remember what happened when you shot
the "Uninvited Guest" in 1998?


322
00:48:05.338 --> 00:48:09.240
When those gangsters
busted in on the shoot...


323
00:48:12.245 --> 00:48:13.837
"Stop it!"

324
00:48:13.947 --> 00:48:17.610
You shouted at them boldly!
What's happened to your guts now?


325
00:48:19.452 --> 00:48:20.919
Who are you?

326
00:48:21.021 --> 00:48:22.488
Who, me?

327
00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:26.288
Maybe you'll recognize me like this.

328
00:48:43.443 --> 00:48:44.967
Nope?

329
00:48:47.714 --> 00:48:49.978
Red Hunt! Huh?

330
00:49:14.074 --> 00:49:14.870
Water!

331
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:18.971
Water!

332
00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:23.746
Water...

333
00:49:27.087 --> 00:49:28.918
What the hell?

334
00:49:30.323 --> 00:49:32.154
Ready, huh?

335
00:49:32.258 --> 00:49:33.225
Action, huh?

336
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.688
And... cut!

337
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:57.908
She's a pianist...

338
00:49:58.018 --> 00:50:02.250
I know that of course!
I've done my research.


339
00:50:02.355 --> 00:50:06.121
It's got to be the pianist's fingers
for the cut to mean something.


340
00:50:06.226 --> 00:50:10.629
Only an idiot would want
her toes instead!


341
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:11.856
Honey!

342
00:50:11.965 --> 00:50:14.195
Honey, I'll...

343
00:50:15.235 --> 00:50:17.260
take care of this somehow.

344
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:20.533
Honey, are you all right?
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?


345
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.507
I still don't know what's going on...

346
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:26.807
But I'm sure we can
get out of this somehow.


347
00:50:26.913 --> 00:50:28.380
Just trust me, okay?

348
00:50:29.582 --> 00:50:31.106
Does it hurt a lot, honey?

349
00:50:31.217 --> 00:50:32.497
Try and bear it a little longer!

350
00:50:32.552 --> 00:50:34.110
Do that for me, okay?

351
00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.916
It will all be over soon.

352
00:50:37.023 --> 00:50:39.014
I'll...

353
00:50:39.125 --> 00:50:43.357
I'll make sure you can play again.

354
00:50:43.463 --> 00:50:46.159
I love you, honey.

355
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.633
Let's be strong.

356
00:50:48.735 --> 00:50:50.327
One way or another, I'll...

357
00:50:56.843 --> 00:50:59.209
- I remember you now!
- Yeah?


358
00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:02.548
An extra.

359
00:51:06.052 --> 00:51:10.785
I was in all
five of your films, sir.

360
00:51:12.826 --> 00:51:15.727
You were such a kind man,

361
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:19.731
unlike any other directors
I've ever worked with.


362
00:51:19.833 --> 00:51:23.291
So kind, no matter
what mistakes I made.


363
00:51:23.403 --> 00:51:27.339
Remember the mob scene
in "The Desert"?


364
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.136
You were shooting the crowd
running in the distance.


365
00:51:30.243 --> 00:51:33.508
Some moron knocked over
a hornet's nest as we ran.


366
00:51:33.613 --> 00:51:38.641
I got stung, I freaked out
and I ruined the take.


367
00:51:38.752 --> 00:51:40.720
Naturally...

368
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.587
the damn assistant director
gave me hell.


369
00:51:45.692 --> 00:51:47.023
But then you said...

370
00:51:47.127 --> 00:51:51.188
How about using the time to set up
another take instead of yelling?


371
00:51:51.297 --> 00:51:53.561
It's not like he wanted to get stung.

372
00:51:54.968 --> 00:51:56.663
Is your neck okay?

373
00:51:57.804 --> 00:52:01.262
You were so sweet.

374
00:52:08.381 --> 00:52:13.910
But what's the use of that?

375
00:52:16.256 --> 00:52:18.690
You don't even recognize me.

376
00:52:19.592 --> 00:52:20.957
Why are you doing this to me?

377
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.119
What do you mean, "Why"?

378
00:52:23.229 --> 00:52:27.325
Because this world is so fucked up!
That's why!


379
00:52:27.433 --> 00:52:30.061
Look at this, look!

380
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.139
I didn't even know there were
houses like this in Korea!


381
00:52:33.239 --> 00:52:36.868
Lots of people are better off than us.
This house is merely...


382
00:52:39.112 --> 00:52:41.774
All the rich people I've ever met...

383
00:52:41.881 --> 00:52:45.612
they're all scumbags,
no respect for people.


384
00:52:45.718 --> 00:52:49.814
I don't even consider them
human beings.


385
00:52:51.891 --> 00:52:55.952
But you, you are a good man.

386
00:52:57.664 --> 00:52:59.427
That's so fucking unfair!

387
00:52:59.532 --> 00:53:02.865
You're rich, handsome,
educated in America,


388
00:53:02.969 --> 00:53:06.564
a genius director,
and you have a pretty wife.


389
00:53:06.673 --> 00:53:11.269
If you're also a good man
on top of that,


390
00:53:11.377 --> 00:53:14.471
what are guys like me
supposed to get?


391
00:53:17.283 --> 00:53:19.217
You know, on TV shows,

392
00:53:19.319 --> 00:53:21.685
only the poor folks are good people.

393
00:53:21.788 --> 00:53:23.050
Never the rich!

394
00:53:23.957 --> 00:53:29.827
You've already got everything.
Why do you have to corner us too?


395
00:53:29.929 --> 00:53:31.829
Why are you a good man too?

396
00:53:31.931 --> 00:53:36.129
You live well in this world
and you'll live well in heaven.


397
00:53:36.236 --> 00:53:39.137
Our lives suck and we're going to hell.

398
00:53:40.106 --> 00:53:42.370
This is totally outrageous.

399
00:53:42.475 --> 00:53:44.466
That's not true.

400
00:53:44.577 --> 00:53:46.841
"It's harder for a rich man
to get into heaven


401
00:53:46.946 --> 00:53:49.744
than a camel to go through
the eye of a needle."


402
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:52.977
- It's in the Bible!
- Bullshit.


403
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:57.614
It's easier for a rich man
to get into heaven


404
00:53:57.724 --> 00:54:00.784
than putting a needle
into a camel's nostril!


405
00:54:03.196 --> 00:54:05.858
Face it, you've got no cause to sin.

406
00:54:05.965 --> 00:54:08.456
Of course I have.

407
00:54:08.568 --> 00:54:11.731
Then prove it!

408
00:54:17.277 --> 00:54:19.745
What persistence.

409
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:34.321
I'm sorry for being a good person.

410
00:54:34.427 --> 00:54:37.294
Look at that! Look!

411
00:54:37.397 --> 00:54:39.456
What a good man!

412
00:54:55.748 --> 00:54:57.545
I can let your wife go.

413
00:54:59.052 --> 00:55:01.782
On one condition.

414
00:55:01.888 --> 00:55:04.584
You have to kill someone right here!
Can you do that?


415
00:55:14.434 --> 00:55:16.664
I'll do as you wish.

416
00:55:16.769 --> 00:55:19.033
Let her go and
I'll die in her place.

417
00:56:06.786 --> 00:56:07.878
You don't need to die.

418
00:56:07.987 --> 00:56:11.423
You just need to strangle
the little kid over there.


419
00:56:11.524 --> 00:56:14.186
If you don't, every five minutes

420
00:56:14.293 --> 00:56:16.818
I'll cut off another one
of your wife's fingers.


421
00:56:16.929 --> 00:56:19.921
Let's see how good you can stay.

422
00:56:23.636 --> 00:56:25.194
Ready.

423
00:56:25.304 --> 00:56:27.135
- Go!
- Who is this kid?


424
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.902
I don't know her either!
Met her on my way here!


425
00:56:30.009 --> 00:56:31.943
She looked bored
so I brought her along.


426
00:56:59.539 --> 00:57:00.801
Guess what.

427
00:57:01.874 --> 00:57:05.833
I've been dirt poor
ever since I was a kid.


428
00:57:07.046 --> 00:57:11.574
My bastard father
was always dead drunk.


429
00:57:12.552 --> 00:57:15.851
He beat the hell out of us
day in and day out.


430
00:57:16.556 --> 00:57:21.858
Needless to say,
my grades were bad.


431
00:57:21.961 --> 00:57:28.662
And this ugly face of mine could
get me nowhere near stardom.


432
00:57:28.768 --> 00:57:32.226
So you see, now I'm the one
who always gets drunk.


433
00:57:32.338 --> 00:57:37.401
I go home and
I kick my boy's ass.

434
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.569
And I beat my wife too.

435
00:57:39.679 --> 00:57:44.412
When I sober up in the morning
and see that swollen, beat-up face of hers,


436
00:57:44.517 --> 00:57:47.042
guess what I think of?

437
00:57:47.153 --> 00:57:49.519
Your face!

438
00:57:50.456 --> 00:57:55.951
Your nice handsome face
overlapping hers.


439
00:57:56.062 --> 00:57:58.360
It makes perfect sense.

440
00:57:58.731 --> 00:58:03.395
A poor kid grows
up to be a bastard

441
00:58:03.503 --> 00:58:06.233
and a rich kid grows up
to be a good man!


442
00:58:06.339 --> 00:58:08.807
That's fate! Damn it!

443
00:58:18.918 --> 00:58:20.579
Hell, no!

444
00:58:20.686 --> 00:58:22.677
No...

445
00:58:30.163 --> 00:58:32.393
Time flies.

446
00:58:42.375 --> 00:58:43.842
What should I do, honey?

447
00:58:43.943 --> 00:58:45.501
Whatever you say.

448
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:46.578
Should I kill her?

449
00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:48.712
Don't kill her?

450
00:58:53.186 --> 00:58:57.213
What a decisive man! My goodness!
What a decisive man!


451
00:58:59.425 --> 00:59:02.758
Listen to me.
Life has many stages.


452
00:59:03.796 --> 00:59:06.959
I went through many difficulties
before getting this far.


453
00:59:07.066 --> 00:59:11.435
It wasn't as easy as you think.
I didn't get it for free.


454
00:59:11.537 --> 00:59:13.004
Someone once said,

455
00:59:13.105 --> 00:59:15.130
"No time to blink, keep striving for..."

456
00:59:15.241 --> 00:59:16.708
Fuck that!

457
00:59:16.809 --> 00:59:18.276
I'm not stupid!

458
00:59:18.377 --> 00:59:20.368
It's a line from your own film!

459
00:59:20.479 --> 00:59:23.107
Jin says that to Rose in "Last Wish."

460
00:59:23.216 --> 00:59:24.683
Want me to follow suit?

461
00:59:24.784 --> 00:59:27.480
Remember the cabaret scene
in "Dancing Factory"?


462
00:59:27.587 --> 00:59:30.750
You wrote the song lyrics as well.

463
00:59:31.457 --> 00:59:35.826
I did some dancing there too.

464
01:00:02.755 --> 01:00:12.755
I'm not going to listen
to your words anymore


465
01:00:13.132 --> 01:00:20.436
All are a pack of lies!
All out of hypocrisy!


466
01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:32.644
We'll make our own words

467
01:00:33.686 --> 01:00:39.750
We'll make our own truth

468
01:00:39.859 --> 01:00:46.321
I'm not going to listen
to your words anymore


469
01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:15.218
I'm sorry, little one.

470
01:01:16.262 --> 01:01:18.287
I really can't hold out.

471
01:01:19.732 --> 01:01:21.256
I'm sorry!

472
01:01:25.938 --> 01:01:27.803
I'm not a good man.

473
01:01:27.907 --> 01:01:29.499
You don't even know me!

474
01:01:29.608 --> 01:01:32.406
How can you prove
that I'm a good man?


475
01:01:35.648 --> 01:01:37.673
The truth is...

476
01:01:37.783 --> 01:01:40.775
whenever an actor
asks for my advice,


477
01:01:40.886 --> 01:01:44.014
I always persuade them not to
work with Director Kim Chang.


478
01:01:44.123 --> 01:01:45.886
Because...

479
01:01:48.361 --> 01:01:50.420
he's my sole rival.

480
01:01:51.464 --> 01:01:57.027
I can't stand that jerk having
any good actors in his films.


481
01:02:03.976 --> 01:02:07.639
You call that shit a confession?

482
01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:11.145
Do I look like an idiot to you?

483
01:02:13.152 --> 01:02:17.555
I've never said that
you were a saint.


484
01:02:17.656 --> 01:02:22.753
Who the hell hasn't done a thing
as trivial as that?


485
01:02:22.862 --> 01:02:24.830
Give me a break.

486
01:02:26.499 --> 01:02:31.334
Let me show you
what a confession really is.


487
01:02:31.437 --> 01:02:33.371
For example...

488
01:02:33.472 --> 01:02:36.737
before I left home this morning,
I killed my wife.


489
01:02:36.842 --> 01:02:40.278
I must have strangled her
for more than 30 minutes.


490
01:02:40.379 --> 01:02:45.749
Her tongue hung out all the way
and she shit everywhere.


491
01:02:46.786 --> 01:02:51.951
I was going to finish my son too,
but it was not that easy.


492
01:02:52.057 --> 01:02:54.184
I just couldn't do that.

493
01:02:56.595 --> 01:03:00.759
Now, that's what I call a confession!

494
01:03:01.967 --> 01:03:03.696
Your turn.

495
01:03:03.803 --> 01:03:06.704
Give me something
nice and juicy.


496
01:03:10.242 --> 01:03:12.472
Wait! I'll talk! I'll talk!

497
01:03:19.084 --> 01:03:25.956
There's a wardrobe girl called Kyung-Ah.
I offered to give her a ride home one day.


498
01:03:27.326 --> 01:03:29.794
I lied that her
home was on my way.

499
01:03:32.031 --> 01:03:33.555
And then I drove her to a motel.

500
01:03:33.666 --> 01:03:38.365
We've been doing this for three years
already since "The Bluebird."


501
01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:45.472
Love isn't a sin.

502
01:03:45.578 --> 01:03:47.978
We dropped by a motel tonight too.

503
01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.674
Lakeside Motel, room 304.

504
01:03:52.418 --> 01:03:57.117
We did it twice in three hours.
No... three times in two hours.


505
01:04:00.593 --> 01:04:02.288
I'm really sorry, honey.

506
01:04:04.163 --> 01:04:08.497
I shouldn't have told you this
when you're already suffering so much.


507
01:04:10.736 --> 01:04:12.704
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

508
01:04:15.374 --> 01:04:17.365
But then...

509
01:04:21.514 --> 01:04:23.379
you shouldn't mind this.

510
01:04:24.483 --> 01:04:28.385
You've never had any real pains in your life,
and no worries either.


511
01:04:29.788 --> 01:04:32.120
Know why I like Kyung
-Ah?

512
01:04:35.427 --> 01:04:41.889
Unlike you, she's smart,
and we can talk about many things.


513
01:04:42.001 --> 01:04:45.232
As for you, I'd rather you
not to talk to me at all.


514
01:04:45.337 --> 01:04:49.000
All you care to talk about
are clothes and plastic surgery!


515
01:04:51.043 --> 01:04:53.534
When I make love to you,

516
01:04:53.646 --> 01:04:57.514
I'm not sure whether I'm holding
a woman or a bag of silicon.


517
01:04:57.616 --> 01:04:59.379
Guess how old my wife is.

518
01:05:00.419 --> 01:05:02.216
33.

519
01:05:02.321 --> 01:05:06.155
Just one year younger than me
but already a Botox junkie.


520
01:05:06.258 --> 01:05:08.556
Now her expression doesn't change
even if she smiles.


521
01:05:08.661 --> 01:05:11.289
What she has is not a face
but a mask.


522
01:05:11.397 --> 01:05:13.262
And that mask yelps at me every day,

523
01:05:13.365 --> 01:05:15.265
"I love you, honey!"

524
01:05:15.968 --> 01:05:21.838
Mi-ran, be honest for just
this once in your life.


525
01:05:22.975 --> 01:05:25.341
Do you know what love is?

526
01:05:25.444 --> 01:05:27.742
Don't pity yourself
for losing your fingers.


527
01:05:27.846 --> 01:05:31.043
They don't deserve any tears.

528
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:33.550
Because you can't play for shit.

529
01:05:33.652 --> 01:05:37.213
Plus, you don't cook
and you never clean.


530
01:05:37.323 --> 01:05:40.451
You hands have no use anyway
other than for wearing jewelry.


531
01:05:42.494 --> 01:05:44.485
Listen.

532
01:05:44.597 --> 01:05:47.122
Know what an artist without talent is?

533
01:05:47.232 --> 01:05:48.893
Nada.

534
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:50.434
Not existing.

535
01:05:50.536 --> 01:05:53.437
A nothing.

536
01:05:53.539 --> 01:06:00.035
Like a ring without a hole
or a square ball! Get it?


537
01:06:02.081 --> 01:06:05.107
If you can't play,
it'll be nice and quiet here.


538
01:06:05.217 --> 01:06:09.984
Also... it'll be so much lighter
for you to wave "Bye-bye"!


539
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:13.215
No, no, no, not yet.

540
01:06:15.361 --> 01:06:18.558
There's something else
I've been trying to say.


541
01:06:20.466 --> 01:06:24.402
I've been holding it back
for a whole 10 years now.


542
01:06:24.503 --> 01:06:26.494
Curious?

543
01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:29.807
Screw you, bitch!

544
01:06:37.816 --> 01:06:39.681
Truth is, she has an affair too.

545
01:06:40.819 --> 01:06:43.549
Know the tenor she plays
accompaniment for?


546
01:06:43.656 --> 01:06:46.124
He's her lover.
Do you know?


547
01:06:46.225 --> 01:06:49.683
I saw it all when I was
following her around.


548
01:06:49.795 --> 01:06:51.262
Am I wrong?

549
01:06:51.363 --> 01:06:53.354
Speak up for yourself.

550
01:06:54.533 --> 01:06:57.627
Oh, I forgot you're gagged.

551
01:06:57.736 --> 01:07:00.569
But you can nod, can't you?

552
01:07:00.939 --> 01:07:05.000
Do what you should do!

553
01:07:07.646 --> 01:07:08.408
Ah...

554
01:07:08.514 --> 01:07:10.175
You already knew!

555
01:07:10.282 --> 01:07:12.409
Didn't you?
Didn't you?


556
01:07:14.186 --> 01:07:15.949
How about this?

557
01:07:17.156 --> 01:07:19.386
I'm kind of depressed.

558
01:07:19.491 --> 01:07:21.584
So if you really want
to buy some time,


559
01:07:21.694 --> 01:07:24.458
you can try to make me laugh.

560
01:07:24.563 --> 01:07:28.329
Every time you succeed, I'll extend
the deadline another five minutes.


561
01:07:28.434 --> 01:07:31.562
You've made good comedies.

562
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:36.039
Now you can try your hand
at acting in one.


563
01:07:36.141 --> 01:07:37.438
Okay?

564
01:07:40.212 --> 01:07:42.237
- Ready and...
- You son of a bitch!


565
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:47.910
You... you've never seen me
losing my temper, right?


566
01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.614
I'm going to show it to you now.

567
01:07:50.723 --> 01:07:52.918
You son of a bitch.

568
01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:57.018
Your dad was a moron
and he made you a loser.


569
01:07:57.129 --> 01:07:58.721
Is that my fault?

570
01:07:58.831 --> 01:08:00.924
Did I rob your bank?

571
01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:03.558
Did I steal your wife?

572
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:07.366
What do I have to do
with your unhappy existence?


573
01:08:07.473 --> 01:08:10.306
Shame on you, you moron.

574
01:08:10.409 --> 01:08:12.172
Why don't you just kill yourself?

575
01:08:12.277 --> 01:08:15.440
Your life is a waste of time anyway.

576
01:08:15.547 --> 01:08:17.845
Want me to make you laugh?

577
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:20.441
Do you know who you're talking to?

578
01:08:20.552 --> 01:08:23.385
I'm Ryu Ji-ho, the Ryu Ji-ho!

579
01:08:23.489 --> 01:08:26.981
You're merely a lowlife extra!
You want me to make you what?


580
01:08:29.027 --> 01:08:32.690
Get the hell out of here.

581
01:08:32.798 --> 01:08:35.198
Just untie me and go home!

582
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.928
Go fix your son
some instant noodles, okay?


583
01:08:42.341 --> 01:08:47.369
You've freaked me out and corrupted me.
Your mission has been completed.


584
01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.539
I'll never mention what happened today.

585
01:08:50.649 --> 01:08:55.279
If you want her fingers that much,
cut them all off!


586
01:08:55.387 --> 01:08:58.015
Or better, just cut off her hands!

587
01:08:58.123 --> 01:09:02.150
Why bother cutting off
her fingers one by one?


588
01:09:02.261 --> 01:09:08.325
Just finish it quickly and
get the hell out of here.


589
01:09:08.433 --> 01:09:10.560
I want nothing more.

590
01:09:11.904 --> 01:09:13.496
No, wait!

591
01:09:25.417 --> 01:09:27.783
My closing statement.

592
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:35.577
You've never gone for cheap laughs
like this in your comedies.


593
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:40.989
You're so disappointing.

594
01:10:41.093 --> 01:10:43.061
Wait, wait!

595
01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:45.823
I was too wound up.

596
01:10:45.931 --> 01:10:47.398
I made mistakes.

597
01:10:47.499 --> 01:10:49.933
I swear I didn't mean to do so.
Wait! Wait!


598
01:10:53.138 --> 01:10:54.605
What are you doing now?

599
01:10:56.308 --> 01:10:57.775
What are you doing?

600
01:10:59.711 --> 01:11:01.440
Wait, wait, wait.

601
01:11:02.648 --> 01:11:04.843
Give me one more chance.
Just give me one more try.


602
01:11:05.183 --> 01:11:06.707
Please! I beg you!

603
01:11:07.619 --> 01:11:11.453
My pose was bad, and I couldn't help
making that kind of mistake.


604
01:11:11.556 --> 01:11:13.581
Don't be so inflexible!

605
01:11:13.692 --> 01:11:15.159
Just one more chance.

606
01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.921
Damn it.

607
01:11:20.499 --> 01:11:25.801
I shouldn't have given you
any false hope.


608
01:11:27.105 --> 01:11:30.370
Nowadays, if you get to the hospital
within 10 hours,


609
01:11:30.475 --> 01:11:32.443
they can reattach the fingers neatly.

610
01:11:43.755 --> 01:11:47.452
No! Wait! I'll do it! I'll kill her!
Look, I'm doing it now!


611
01:11:49.695 --> 01:11:50.787
You bastard!

612
01:11:50.896 --> 01:11:54.696
I said I was going to do it!

613
01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.665
Why didn't you wait?

614
01:12:03.108 --> 01:12:04.575
You saw it too, right?

615
01:12:05.477 --> 01:12:07.877
You know I have no choice.

616
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.278
Honey, I'm going to do it, okay?

617
01:12:10.382 --> 01:12:11.679
That was three, right?

618
01:12:11.783 --> 01:12:13.307
Three, so, seven...

619
01:12:13.418 --> 01:12:15.318
You'll keep your seven, honey!

620
01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.854
I'm doing this not because
I hate you, okay?


621
01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:23.485
You think I'm doing this
because I hate your wife?


622
01:12:23.595 --> 01:12:26.291
"Hate" is nobody's fault.

623
01:12:26.398 --> 01:12:29.959
For example, who do you think
she hates more right now?


624
01:12:31.003 --> 01:12:33.528
Me or you?

625
01:12:34.539 --> 01:12:36.700
Let's hear it!

626
01:12:38.744 --> 01:12:40.678
Kill her! Kill her!

627
01:12:40.779 --> 01:12:43.339
What are you waiting for, you idiot?

628
01:12:43.448 --> 01:12:44.540
Kill her!

629
01:12:44.649 --> 01:12:47.277
I'm telling you! Kill her!

630
01:12:52.958 --> 01:12:54.892
You see?

631
01:12:56.728 --> 01:12:58.389
Easy, miss.

632
01:12:58.897 --> 01:13:04.802
You'll probably have one finger
left on each hand.


633
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:09.468
He's got to give in by then.

634
01:13:11.743 --> 01:13:14.610
You can still become a percussionist.

635
01:13:14.713 --> 01:13:18.274
No law against playing drums
with "Chopsticks."


636
01:13:19.317 --> 01:13:24.687
Common folks like me prefer
drum beats to music.


637
01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:26.136
You're right, better to just
cut off her whole hand.


638
01:15:31.516 --> 01:15:35.213
Damn time flies.

639
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.084
47 seconds...

640
01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:39.987
46 seconds...

641
01:15:40.091 --> 01:15:42.286
- No!
- 45 seconds...


642
01:15:42.394 --> 01:15:46.854
44 seconds, 43 seconds.

643
01:15:46.965 --> 01:15:50.765
42 seconds, 41 seconds.

644
01:15:50.869 --> 01:15:55.306
40 seconds, 39 seconds.

645
01:15:55.407 --> 01:15:58.968
38 seconds, 37 seconds.

646
01:15:59.077 --> 01:16:01.773
36 seconds, 35 seconds.

647
01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:06.715
34 seconds, 33 seconds.

648
01:16:06.818 --> 01:16:11.050
32 seconds, 31 seconds.

649
01:16:11.156 --> 01:16:15.286
30 seconds, 29 seconds.

650
01:16:15.393 --> 01:16:17.327
25 seconds...

651
01:16:17.429 --> 01:16:20.193
22 seconds...

652
01:16:20.298 --> 01:16:21.492
20 seconds...

653
01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:25.900
19 seconds, 18 seconds.

654
01:16:26.004 --> 01:16:29.303
17 seconds, 16 seconds.

655
01:16:29.407 --> 01:16:32.308
15 seconds, 14 seconds.

656
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:37.040
13 seconds, 12 seconds.

657
01:16:37.148 --> 01:16:40.140
11 seconds, 10 seconds.

658
01:16:40.252 --> 01:16:42.516
9 seconds.

659
01:16:42.621 --> 01:16:43.645
8 seconds.

660
01:16:43.755 --> 01:16:46.349
- No!
- 7 seconds!


661
01:16:46.458 --> 01:16:47.686
6 seconds!

662
01:16:47.792 --> 01:16:49.760
5 seconds!

663
01:16:49.861 --> 01:16:50.987
4 seconds!

664
01:16:51.096 --> 01:16:52.028
3 seconds!

665
01:18:23.221 --> 01:18:25.519
Mr. Director...

666
01:18:25.623 --> 01:18:27.454
How about this?

667
01:18:31.563 --> 01:18:34.225
For example...

668
01:18:56.688 --> 01:18:58.155
You scumbags...

669
01:19:03.995 --> 01:19:05.292
I'll take revenge.

670
01:19:46.604 --> 01:19:47.571
I'm sorry.

671
01:19:49.707 --> 01:19:52.232
I'm sorry. It can't be helped.

672
01:19:53.511 --> 01:19:54.910
I tried my best!

673
01:19:55.513 --> 01:19:57.174
You saw it all!

674
01:19:57.282 --> 01:19:58.840
Yes, you did!

675
01:19:58.950 --> 01:20:03.387
I have to do this
for my wife, you know.


676
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:07.815
I really love her.

677
01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.588
It's hard for a kid
like you to understand.


678
01:20:11.696 --> 01:20:15.928
The world is filled with things
you can't get away from.


679
01:20:16.034 --> 01:20:18.662
No matter how hard you struggle...

680
01:20:19.637 --> 01:20:22.401
there are things you're
being forced to do.


681
01:20:26.177 --> 01:20:27.303
Dear...

682
01:20:27.412 --> 01:20:28.936
All right, honey!

683
01:20:29.047 --> 01:20:31.538
Just wait a bit!
I'll take care of it!


684
01:20:32.584 --> 01:20:34.347
I'm sorry.

685
01:20:34.452 --> 01:20:36.647
Really sorry.

686
01:20:36.754 --> 01:20:40.121
- I'm sorry...
- Ple... Please!


687
01:20:40.225 --> 01:20:44.662
Don't rush me! Can't you see I'm trying?
It'll be over soon!


688
01:20:47.632 --> 01:20:50.601
I'm sorry I shouted, honey.
You know I love you!


689
01:20:53.071 --> 01:20:55.266
I don't believe you have another man.

690
01:20:56.708 --> 01:20:59.541
I don't care even if it's true.
I'm going to forget it all.


691
01:20:59.644 --> 01:21:02.010
After all, I'm the head of the house.

692
01:21:03.915 --> 01:21:09.046
I must forget everything that happened today.
I'll just think of it as a dream.


693
01:21:09.387 --> 01:21:10.684
I love you, honey!

694
01:21:12.924 --> 01:21:15.051
I'm so sorry, kid.

695
01:21:15.159 --> 01:21:17.150
I'm truly sorry.

696
01:21:17.262 --> 01:21:20.095
Please forgive me.

697
01:21:21.566 --> 01:21:23.193
I love you, Mi-ran.

698
01:21:24.802 --> 01:21:27.430
Please forgive me, this grown-up...

699
01:21:28.473 --> 01:21:29.940
this old man.

700
01:21:30.041 --> 01:21:34.068
Forgive me.
You have to forgive me.


701
01:21:38.249 --> 01:21:39.739
Honey, I love you.

702
01:21:46.558 --> 01:21:48.526
Forgive me.

703
01:21:49.561 --> 01:21:51.188
I'm sorry.

704
01:21:52.664 --> 01:21:54.256
Sorry.

705
01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.733
Forgive me.

706
01:24:09.434 --> 01:24:11.425
The dream...

707
01:24:13.004 --> 01:24:14.972
always...

708
01:24:16.107 --> 01:24:18.405
ends there.

709
01:25:45.296 --> 01:25:49.062
You still don't trust me, do you?

710
01:26:01.379 --> 01:26:04.507
The box is too small.
I can't breathe.


711
01:27:48.019 --> 01:27:49.987
I finished it.

712
01:27:51.489 --> 01:27:53.457
Thank you very much.

713
01:27:54.659 --> 01:27:57.822
I'll go to the
office and read it over.

714
01:28:12.843 --> 01:28:16.176
Your handwriting is almost
as neat as typing.


715
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:23.148
I don't mean it should be typed, either.

716
01:28:27.825 --> 01:28:29.884
I don't have a choice.

717
01:28:34.332 --> 01:28:37.631
I can't type.

718
01:28:40.972 --> 01:28:43.566
You're left-handed, aren't you?

719
01:28:47.011 --> 01:28:51.471
I've read so many manuscripts.

720
01:28:51.582 --> 01:28:54.073
I can tell whether it's left or right.

721
01:29:04.395 --> 01:29:08.092
I'll be in touch then.

722
01:29:26.584 --> 01:29:28.051
One thing...

723
01:29:30.521 --> 01:29:32.011
I mean...

724
01:29:35.926 --> 01:29:38.156
Your novels are doing very well.

725
01:29:38.262 --> 01:29:41.629
Here, a small token.

726
01:33:09.807 --> 01:33:11.365
Sis'?

727
01:33:16.847 --> 01:33:18.314
Sister, dear?

728
01:33:23.621 --> 01:33:25.282
It's you, isn't it?

729
01:33:28.759 --> 01:33:30.317
It's me.

730
01:33:32.796 --> 01:33:34.263
Kyoko.

731
01:33:38.402 --> 01:33:40.461
Say something.

732
01:33:44.842 --> 01:33:46.434
Sister!

733
01:34:17.041 --> 01:34:18.770
It's hot...

734
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:20.576
I'm burning...

735
01:34:25.482 --> 01:34:29.748
It wasn't what you think!

736
01:34:31.088 --> 01:34:32.715
It really wasn't!

737
01:34:33.123 --> 01:34:34.590
It wasn't!

738
01:37:03.474 --> 01:37:04.634
Shoko...

739
01:37:06.243 --> 01:37:09.838
You... did well today.

740
01:37:11.548 --> 01:37:13.311
A little reward.

741
01:37:20.524 --> 01:37:23.584
Keep up the good work.

742
01:37:33.403 --> 01:37:36.167
Kyoko, keep trying!

743
01:37:36.273 --> 01:37:38.605
You'll be rewarded too.

744
01:40:11.528 --> 01:40:13.120
Sensei.

745
01:40:21.405 --> 01:40:22.895
I was looking...

746
01:40:25.542 --> 01:40:27.373
...looking for someone.

747
01:40:30.247 --> 01:40:31.714
Someone?

748
01:40:36.687 --> 01:40:38.120
Who is it?

749
01:40:46.563 --> 01:40:49.031
Can't I be him?

750
01:40:52.536 --> 01:40:54.333
At least...

751
01:40:56.573 --> 01:40:58.973
...I'm here for you.

752
01:41:06.683 --> 01:41:08.651
You do look like him.

753
01:42:21.291 --> 01:42:23.987
Bear it for one night.

754
01:42:26.329 --> 01:42:28.297
I want to be you...

755
01:42:29.166 --> 01:42:30.963
to sleep like you...

756
01:42:32.469 --> 01:42:36.701
to have nice dreams.

757
01:42:42.579 --> 01:42:44.410
What's going on?

758
01:42:59.996 --> 01:43:01.827
Shoko, don't worry.

759
01:43:39.369 --> 01:43:41.337
Shoko!

760
01:49:36.226 --> 01:49:37.750
Sister...

761
01:49:40.129 --> 01:49:41.619
I'm sorry.

762
01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:51.006
I didn't do it out of hatred.

763
01:49:54.777 --> 01:49:57.507
It wasn't the necklace, either.

764
01:50:01.384 --> 01:50:04.114
I loved you so much, sis'.

765
01:50:15.265 --> 01:50:17.665
I looked for you everywhere.

766
01:50:20.703 --> 01:50:22.694
It's true.

767
01:50:25.575 --> 01:50:28.976
I loved you more than
anyone in the world.


768
01:50:32.348 --> 01:50:33.815
More than anyone.

769
01:50:59.042 --> 01:51:00.771
Help me...

770
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:09.537
So beautiful.

771
01:53:39.001 --> 01:53:40.901
10-year-old Shoko and...

772
01:53:43.339 --> 01:53:45.466
25-year-old Kyoko.

773
01:53:50.246 --> 01:53:52.714
Which one of you is more beautiful?

774
01:54:05.895 --> 01:54:07.795
Oh, Kyoko...

775
01:54:11.067 --> 01:54:14.195
- Why did you do it?
- Don't...


776
01:54:20.409 --> 01:54:25.813
You thought I only loved your sister?

777
01:54:37.226 --> 01:54:38.784
Poor thing...

778
01:54:42.031 --> 01:54:45.296
The heat was unbearable.

779
01:54:45.401 --> 01:54:46.868
Don't!

780
01:54:48.938 --> 01:54:51.304
She couldn't get out.

781
01:54:56.979 --> 01:54:58.640
She's trapped.

782
01:54:58.748 --> 01:54:59.737
Don't!

783
01:55:04.921 --> 01:55:07.151
In that tiny box!

784
01:55:08.491 --> 01:55:09.958
No, no!

785
01:55:33.549 --> 01:55:34.607
Look.

786
01:55:36.218 --> 01:55:37.446
Look!

787
01:55:39.322 --> 01:55:43.918
If you hadn't done it,
she'd be here now!


788
01:55:49.732 --> 01:55:51.324
I'm sorry.

789
01:55:52.368 --> 01:55:54.893
I'm sorry.

790
01:55:55.438 --> 01:55:57.133
I'm so sorry.

791
01:55:57.239 --> 01:55:58.900
I'm sorry.

792
01:56:01.477 --> 01:56:02.774
I'm sorry.

793
01:56:05.414 --> 01:56:07.109
I'm sorry.

794
01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:09.708
I'm sorry.

795
01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.116
I saved one for you too.

796
01:56:49.892 --> 01:56:50.859
What?

797
01:59:08.564 --> 01:59:10.930
Can't have one without the other!

798
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:15.296
Shoko and Kyoko...

799
01:59:16.906 --> 01:59:19.739
Together, a perfect pair.

800
01:59:24.246 --> 01:59:28.774
You're one and the same to me!

801
02:00:37.519 --> 02:00:39.146
The dream...

802
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:43.015
always...

803
02:00:44.193 --> 02:00:46.093
ends just there.

804
02:01:20.796 --> 02:01:22.263
Good morning.

805
02:01:27.369 --> 02:01:28.836
Good morning.

806
02:01:32.975 --> 02:01:35.341
In reality...

807
02:01:37.346 --> 02:01:39.473
we've been together...

808
02:01:40.516 --> 02:01:42.609
since birth.

809
02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:46.288
I had a weird dream.

810
02:01:48.223 --> 02:01:49.884
Me too.

811
02:02:08.377 --> 02:02:09.844
But then...

812
02:02:12.047 --> 02:02:13.776
our dreams...

813
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:16.918
differ slightly.

814
02:02:53.856 --> 02:02:56.825
