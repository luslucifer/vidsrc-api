1
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.152
Fucking hell, man.

2
00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.350
- Where's the love, man?
- Somebody's got a problem.


3
00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:51.687
Rich, you're driving like my fucking
granny, and my granny's dead.


4
00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:54.061
- Sure, look at that car.
- And my granny's dead.


5
00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:56.936
- Oh, my God!
- That is a Mustang.


6
00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:04.610
- I did defend him.
- He still got slagged.


7
00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:07.774
And everybody was still a bollocks
to him. That's not my fault.


8
00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:10.736
- You failed in your mission.
- Yeah, I did, man. I did.


9
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.026
You should... You should just give up
your armband as class captain.


10
00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:16.268
Because you fucked up.

11
00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:20.520
Right, I'm fucking dropping
the two of youse off.


12
00:01:25.808 --> 00:01:27.060
Oh, my God, man.

13
00:01:27.183 --> 00:01:30.938
That was her first shot at that
and you just shot her down straight away.


14
00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:34.688
You can make him a sandwich.
Whatever is gonna be nice, you think,


15
00:01:34.808 --> 00:01:37.152
and you're just gonna have it.
That was nothing.


16
00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:40.601
Well, no, I'm dressing it first
and then we're adding...


17
00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.978
He likes to dress things before he...

18
00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:45.525
Eat it anyway.

19
00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:48.942
Yeah, well, maybe you'd like to eat it
when you farted on it.


20
00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:51.152
- Chicken fillets, yeah?
- Yeah, for me.


21
00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:52.940
You seriously didn't get mine?

22
00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:56.191
You fucking...
What the fuck did I say to you?


23
00:01:56.308 --> 00:02:00.017
- When are you going on your break?
- I'm going right now.


24
00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:03.520
- "When's your break?"
- "I'm on my break now."


25
00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:05.315
"You're on your break..."

26
00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:06.980
Oh, here. Wait, wait, wait...

27
00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:11.189
Jakesy.

28
00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:13.402
- You alright, man?
- How's things?


29
00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:16.396
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Are you well? What are you doing


30
00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:18.940
- for the rest of the afternoon?
- Nothing.


31
00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:21.311
OK, look. See that card?
All you have to do is...


32
00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:22.855
- Take it?
- No, don't take it.


33
00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:25.228
All you have to do
is give it a little rub.


34
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.651
- That is savage. Absolutely class.
- Slick, isn't he? He's slick.


35
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.934
- Stop doing that. Fuck's sake.
- How did you fold that, though?


36
00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.648
No.

37
00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:51.817
- Hey, ladies.
- Guys, so nice of you to show up.


38
00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:55.187
- Hey there, pecs.
- Thanks for having us down.


39
00:02:56.225 --> 00:02:57.602
No worries, it'll be good.

40
00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:01.150
- Who's the baby?
- This, ladies, is Magic Boy.


41
00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:02.985
- Jake.
- Alright?


42
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.398
He's the coolest.
Take care of him, yeah?


43
00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.019
- What's your name?
- Jake.


44
00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.356
This is the gaff.

45
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.400
- Stop being a retard.
- Rich, this is so adorable.


46
00:03:26.517 --> 00:03:28.394
Done. I got it. I got it!

47
00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:29.814
Bagsy top bunk.

48
00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:37.270
Somebody said
there was a party here, lads.


49
00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:39.315
- Hey, Ois.
- Come here to me, buddy.


50
00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:41.356
- Good to see you. Alright?
- Good, man.


51
00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:44.274
How's form? Alright, lads?
How's things?


52
00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.940
- Hey, superstar.
- Hey, Sophie.


53
00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:50.686
- What's going on? How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.


54
00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:54.108
- Yeah? Does your da know you're here?
- Come meet my friends.


55
00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:56.603
- They'll freak the fuck...
- Jake, come here.


56
00:03:56.725 --> 00:03:58.068
- This is Richard.
- Hey.


57
00:03:58.183 --> 00:04:01.437
How are you? Rich. Nice to meet you.
How's it going, man?


58
00:04:01.558 --> 00:04:04.061
Jake, do you know Sophie, by the way?
Have you met?


59
00:04:04.183 --> 00:04:06.356
- Yeah, I've seen you before.
- How are you?


60
00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:17.310
I definitely won't be going for a swim.

61
00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:19.231
- So would you, Rich?
- What?


62
00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:22.185
Sophie Kilroy.

63
00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:24.527
- Fuck off, man.
- Of course he would.


64
00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:28.567
- She's Pat's daughter, lads.
- And? You love him.


65
00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:32.688
It would be like shagging your idol,
only not going gay, you know.


66
00:04:32.808 --> 00:04:34.606
- Hey, Conor.
- Hey.


67
00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:36.022
Conor, I'm freezing.

68
00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:38.440
Oh, my God, Lara.

69
00:04:38.558 --> 00:04:40.652
- Hi!
- Hi, Con-man, what's up?


70
00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:42.519
Super
-Rich. What's the craic?

71
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.694
I didn't know you guys were here.

72
00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:51.645
Alright, lads.
I'm gonna go and be sociable.


73
00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:55.731
Do you want a drink
or something?


74
00:04:57.517 --> 00:05:00.236
- Hey, guys. Can I grab a water?
- Yeah.


75
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.943
Nice. Thanks.

76
00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:07.809
Sorry, do you guys know each other?
Lara Hogan, this is Richard Karlsen.


77
00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.310
- Hey.
- Hi.


78
00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:11.902
- You down for long?
- Just tonight.


79
00:05:12.017 --> 00:05:15.066
- Where are you staying at?
- Tent City.


80
00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:18.642
- And yourself'?
- Just over by the pub over there.


81
00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:20.144
There's a pub?

82
00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:22.310
With a roof?

83
00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:29.852
Here, where's Jake?

84
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.069
Here, man.
Look, you look about 12. Take that off.


85
00:05:35.642 --> 00:05:36.734
Con.

86
00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:40.444
Con-man. I got my invitation
to your party.


87
00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:43.858
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man. Nice photo collage.


88
00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:47.149
Everybody looks a twat in their
communion photos, to be fair.


89
00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:50.111
I bet you looked shit cool
in yours, though, Rich.


90
00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.651
Come to think of it, maybe I did.

91
00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:55.941
- If I see a drink in his hand...
- No, we're all over 18.


92
00:05:56.058 --> 00:06:00.939
- Fine, but I won't serve children.
- I may look young, but I'm old money.


93
00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:08.020
- It's Coke.
- Better be.


94
00:06:08.142 --> 00:06:11.521
And no flashing your mickeys.
I know what you rugby lads are like.


95
00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:13.815
You know I wouldn't allow that, Fiona.

96
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.193
Nice one, man.

97
00:06:42.142 --> 00:06:44.941
- Told you I was shit.
- No, it was brilliant.


98
00:06:45.058 --> 00:06:46.731
It was gorgeous.

99
00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:50.026
Going for a smoke, man.

100
00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:07.856
Oh, thanks.

101
00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:09.602
Here.

102
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.067
Thank you.

103
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.693
Here you are.

104
00:07:26.808 --> 00:07:29.607
- I don't actually smoke.
- You're cutting loose?


105
00:07:29.725 --> 00:07:32.729
Yeah, I'm going totally wild.

106
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.102
Go, Conor.

107
00:07:39.517 --> 00:07:41.190
You're not a fan?

108
00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:47.020
I just don't get the whole "lost
in the Celtic mists" intensity of it.


109
00:07:48.683 --> 00:07:51.732
Plus, nobody knows
what the fuck he's saying.


110
00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:58.108
- "I'm asleep and don't wake me."
- Well, I obviously got that bit.


111
00:07:58.225 --> 00:07:59.898
Obviously.

112
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.397
Alright?

113
00:08:02.558 --> 00:08:04.105
- Hey.
- What's up?


114
00:08:07.558 --> 00:08:09.231
Just answer it.

115
00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:13.976
- Magic Boy's mum's freaking out.
- You didn't check in, man?


116
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.353
- Get blazed.
- Give me that.


117
00:08:17.683 --> 00:08:19.526
Richard Karlsen to the rescue.

118
00:08:19.642 --> 00:08:21.861
Mrs Galvin.
Richard Karlsen here.


119
00:08:21.975 --> 00:08:25.229
Yeah, Jake's grand. He's with me.

120
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.559
It's just this kind of unofficial
Raglan tradition we do.


121
00:08:28.683 --> 00:08:31.186
We grab the Js
and bring the lads down the country


122
00:08:31.308 --> 00:08:34.642
to show them what it's like
to be on the senior team.


123
00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:37.111
Oh, yeah, he's being well looked after.

124
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:42.311
We've got a couple of fine Raglan boys
down here just watching out for him.


125
00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:43.901
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:47.191
- He was out there working away and...
- Give me some magic.


127
00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:51.017
He's brilliant. Exceptional.
He's a real credit to you, I must say.


128
00:08:51.142 --> 00:08:53.019
I did indeed do it myself, yeah.

129
00:08:53.142 --> 00:08:55.895
I want to see your titties.

130
00:08:56.017 --> 00:08:57.064
Yeah.

131
00:08:58.183 --> 00:09:00.652
I'll have him call you
first thing in the morning.


132
00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.611
- Show me your tricks.
- Bye-bye.


133
00:09:05.142 --> 00:09:06.940
Outstanding. What a performance...

134
00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:10.392
- Fucking hell.
- How did you not break?


135
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.853
- Fucking idiot.
- How did you not break, man?


136
00:09:13.975 --> 00:09:16.398
- Fair play.
- Fair play.


137
00:09:16.517 --> 00:09:17.734
What's the teams?

138
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.727
I'll go with you. 
I'm not losing again.

139
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.648
You're shit when you play together.

140
00:09:21.767 --> 00:09:25.021
You are the worst pool players
I've ever seen in my life.


141
00:09:25.725 --> 00:09:28.319
I'm just gonna grab a beer.
Give me one sec.


142
00:09:28.433 --> 00:09:31.152
Hey, man, Soph's in trouble.
Just come here.


143
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.444
Bye, guys.

144
00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:38.231
- Sophie?
- Get lost.


145
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.274
- Come on, man, open the door.
- Fuck you.


146
00:09:42.892 --> 00:09:45.645
Fuck off, she's a fucking kid.

147
00:09:46.767 --> 00:09:49.020
Stay there.

148
00:09:50.142 --> 00:09:52.019
- Sophie, come on.
- Just leave me alone.


149
00:09:52.142 --> 00:09:54.895
Let's go. Come on. 
It's over now.

150
00:09:56.475 --> 00:09:58.148
Come on.

151
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.480
- I like being carried by you.
- Sophie, behave.


152
00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:28.272
Here's the good Samaritan man.

153
00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:30.611
- Have a good time, did you?
- Alright.


154
00:10:32.142 --> 00:10:34.895
- How's it going?
- Anyone want a nightcap?


155
00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:37.236
Fuck off, I'm on my break.

156
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.935
I think that lads in general actually
wanna get on with each other,


157
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:45.028
- as opposed to girls who naturally...
- They just like to...


158
00:10:45.142 --> 00:10:49.477
It's like that thing about horses.
Do you know what I mean? Apparently...


159
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.025
Apparently horses, right,
naturally exclude one another.


160
00:10:53.142 --> 00:10:55.691
So if there's three horses in a field,

161
00:10:55.808 --> 00:10:58.937
two of them will stick together
and shun the other one.


162
00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:02.858
It's true. Like us, as in, you know,
we sort of hate each other.


163
00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:06.525
Without getting too fucking gay
about it, right,


164
00:11:06.642 --> 00:11:09.976
I'd talk to you lads
about pretty much anything.


165
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.934
Have you ever seen girls
in a bathroom together


166
00:11:15.058 --> 00:11:17.652
talking about one of them being bulimic?

167
00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:19.690
I don't walk into girls' bathrooms.

168
00:11:19.808 --> 00:11:24.109
It's not funny, but it's fucking funny.
Seriously.


169
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.397
When have you done this?

170
00:11:25.517 --> 00:11:28.270
It was a mate's gaff.
I went up to the jacks.


171
00:11:28.392 --> 00:11:30.895
I walked in and I was like,
"Is it OK if I'm in here?"


172
00:11:31.017 --> 00:11:34.897
There were people drinking everywhere
in the house so I said, "Is it OK?"


173
00:11:35.017 --> 00:11:38.567
They're in there and it's like...
They were sobbing, and I was like,


174
00:11:38.683 --> 00:11:41.186
"I wanna sit down
and see what's going on here."


175
00:11:41.308 --> 00:11:45.814
They're like, "Oh, my God,
please just stop vomiting all the time."


176
00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:48.903
"it's upsetting me.
Why can't you stop vomiting?"


177
00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:51.987
"I think I've got it under control."
And I'm like...


178
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.809
"Are you fucking serious?"
It's creepy, man. That's creepy shit.


179
00:11:55.933 --> 00:11:59.233
- But for them, that's talking.
- Exactly.


180
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.607
This doesn't classify as talking because
we're not talking about fucked-up stuff.


181
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:08.104
We're not all depressed, so it's not
talking. Do you know what I mean?


182
00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:11.525
Like, you have to be upset
to have a chat.


183
00:12:11.642 --> 00:12:13.815
Fuck that, like.

184
00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:52.401
Oh, he's through!

185
00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:05.527
Stop... Put me down.

186
00:14:05.642 --> 00:14:07.644
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:14:07.767 --> 00:14:09.940
They're doing it here on the beach.

188
00:15:10.058 --> 00:15:13.267
- Hey, Liv.
- Hey, sweetheart.


189
00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:15.611
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good to see you.


190
00:15:15.725 --> 00:15:17.272
- And you.
- Aw.


191
00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:21.687
I just wanted to say thanks
for the other day. Sophie told me.


192
00:15:21.808 --> 00:15:23.856
Oh, yeah. That's no problem.

193
00:15:23.975 --> 00:15:27.024
- Does her dad know?
- She was "at her mother's".


194
00:15:27.142 --> 00:15:32.319
Pat's dying to see you. He'll probably
be all restrained and Protestant.


195
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.523
- So?
- So what?


196
00:15:35.642 --> 00:15:37.485
So, any women in your life?

197
00:15:38.558 --> 00:15:41.812
- I'm very close to my mum.
- Come on.


198
00:15:41.933 --> 00:15:44.561
I'm a bit sick
of all the silly stuff, Liv.


199
00:15:44.683 --> 00:15:47.061
At 18?

200
00:15:47.183 --> 00:15:49.561
- There he is now.
- Hey, good to see you.


201
00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:50.775
What's going on?

202
00:15:50.892 --> 00:15:53.361
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Thanks for having us.


203
00:15:53.475 --> 00:15:56.684
- What's the water like?
- It's fucking Baltic.


204
00:15:56.808 --> 00:15:59.778
- Look what the tide washed in.
- Hey, Mum.


205
00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:02.611
- Did you enjoy the free gaff?
- Yeah, can't complain.


206
00:16:03.558 --> 00:16:05.652
Hello, beautiful son.

207
00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:07.269
Hey, old Dad.

208
00:16:08.308 --> 00:16:09.981
(Pat? This looks fantastic.

209
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.604
- I think that's mine, actually.
- I remember you buying it.


210
00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:16.569
Take it easy on them brews,
you're putting on weight.


211
00:16:16.683 --> 00:16:18.651
One beer's not gonna do him any harm.

212
00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:21.646
It's the boy refusing a drink
that he's competing against.


213
00:16:21.767 --> 00:16:24.566
I know that boy. That's the boy
without friends, isn't it?


214
00:16:25.767 --> 00:16:26.893
Skol!

215
00:16:27.017 --> 00:16:30.396
Cheers, Peter. I've spent
six years teaching him to be a winner.


216
00:16:30.517 --> 00:16:32.861
Success is good. 
I like success.

217
00:16:32.975 --> 00:16:35.319
- Failure's not an option.
- That's it.


218
00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:37.936
Failure's not an option,
it's a certainty.


219
00:16:38.058 --> 00:16:40.982
- Here we go.
- It is, at some point, for most people.


220
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.943
- It makes them human.
- It's true.


221
00:16:43.058 --> 00:16:46.608
Very deep, that. All those
long winter nights back in the day?


222
00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:49.478
- A Scandinavian thing, I reckon.
- Big Scandinavian...


223
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.434
No, it's not a Scandinavian thing.
It's just a manic depressive thing.


224
00:16:55.517 --> 00:16:56.643
- Skol.
- Slàinte.


225
00:16:56.767 --> 00:16:58.064
- Slàinte.
- Skol.


226
00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.651
Come on.

227
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.150
Dad, it is not warm out here. Alright?
It's not warm today.


228
00:17:04.267 --> 00:17:06.895
- I thought you played rugby.
- I do play rugby.


229
00:17:07.017 --> 00:17:09.270
That doesn't mean
I like the fucking cold.


230
00:17:10.142 --> 00:17:11.610
Come on.

231
00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:32.062
Yeah! Way to go, son.

232
00:17:34.017 --> 00:17:36.361
You'll make a singer
out of me yet, Dad.


233
00:17:36.475 --> 00:17:39.024
- What?
- You'll make a singer out of me yet.


234
00:17:45.892 --> 00:17:47.644
Well, I'm not staying long.

235
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.899
Thanks very much, cheers.
See you again.


236
00:17:53.017 --> 00:17:56.442
So, remind me, Richard.
Why are we here?


237
00:17:56.558 --> 00:18:00.017
Because Conor's a team-mate of mine
and that means something, Eimear.


238
00:18:00.142 --> 00:18:02.565
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Alright?


239
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.480
God, what is it with GAA jerseys?
They're always so fucking rank.


240
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.935
It's like they deliberately pick
the foulest shade of each colour.


241
00:18:15.058 --> 00:18:18.141
Could you guys say it
any fucking louder?


242
00:18:18.975 --> 00:18:21.603
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- Hey.


243
00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:23.272
- Alright'?
- For the day.


244
00:18:23.392 --> 00:18:25.144
- Cheers.
- Happy birthday.


245
00:18:25.267 --> 00:18:27.065
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.


246
00:18:27.183 --> 00:18:29.481
- Mr H, how are you?
- How's it going, son?


247
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.568
- Will you have a pint?
- I won't, I won't.


248
00:18:31.683 --> 00:18:34.152
- Richard.
- Mrs Harris. You're looking great.


249
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.559
Go on! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!


250
00:18:42.683 --> 00:18:44.777
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

251
00:18:59.392 --> 00:19:03.397
- 0-8-5-0-1-0-7-7-7-7.
- Sorry?


252
00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:05.736
- It's my number.
- You're fast.


253
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.400
Zero-8-5...

254
00:19:09.517 --> 00:19:12.111
- Richard, you're so full of shit.
- I am.


255
00:19:12.225 --> 00:19:15.604
But I'm gonna tell you my number
again. If you remember it, great.


256
00:19:15.725 --> 00:19:17.352
If you don't...

257
00:19:17.475 --> 00:19:19.944
Fine, but my memory's like a sieve.

258
00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:23.187
- Hey, how's it going?
- Never better. It's my birthday, right?


259
00:19:23.308 --> 00:19:26.027
- How are you, Lara?
- Good.


260
00:19:26.142 --> 00:19:28.110
- Super-Rich?
- I'm good, man.


261
00:19:28.225 --> 00:19:31.399
- I thought you weren't drinking.
- Yeah, me too.


262
00:19:33.058 --> 00:19:34.685
Conor, easy.

263
00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:38.899
- You alright, Con-man?
- Yeah, sound, man.


264
00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:42.228
No, you're not. Come on.

265
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.818
I'm fine, I'm fine.

266
00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.069
Come on, we'll go back inside.

267
00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:02.644
- Hey-
- Hey-


268
00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:05.737
- How is he?
- Miserable. Walking it off.


269
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.059
- Everyone gets fucked up on their 18th.
- I suppose.


270
00:20:09.183 --> 00:20:11.811
- He'll be grand.
- Yeah.


271
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.352
I better go.

272
00:20:15.267 --> 00:20:16.644
Yeah.

273
00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:21.481
- Bye, Lara.
- Safe home.


274
00:20:22.142 --> 00:20:25.601
- What the fuck are you doing?
- The right thing. You should try it.


275
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.604
- Hello.
- Hey.


276
00:20:45.725 --> 00:20:48.353
- I rang the door but...
- Erm...


277
00:20:49.267 --> 00:20:51.645
Right, so, here's what I got
for you, OK?


278
00:20:51.767 --> 00:20:55.772
I got... some red wine, right?
That's laid out on the table.


279
00:20:55.892 --> 00:20:58.896
Best steaks in Wicklow
marinating right there.


280
00:20:59.017 --> 00:21:02.817
Erm, I got you some salads,
some really nice French bread,


281
00:21:02.933 --> 00:21:07.439
and I laid these out just in case
the sun decides to pop out. Alright?


282
00:21:38.517 --> 00:21:40.986
We were supposed to eat first.

283
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.819
You should have emailed me
a copy of the schedule.


284
00:21:44.642 --> 00:21:47.065
Just give me one sec, OK?
Just one sec.


285
00:21:48.142 --> 00:21:49.769
You stay there. 
Don't go away.

286
00:22:06.017 --> 00:22:09.817
I used to have a gerbil
that I won at, like, the day fair.


287
00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:13.483
So I brought him home. I was only
about four and I called him Peter.


288
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.647
Right?

289
00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:18.397
At the end of the day... I only bought
him that day, but at the end of the day,


290
00:22:18.517 --> 00:22:21.270
I wanted to wash him
because I thought he needed a shower.


291
00:22:21.392 --> 00:22:23.486
Shh! Listen.

292
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.434
First, I made him a little bed
in, like, a tissue box, right?


293
00:22:27.558 --> 00:22:30.767
With tissue paper
and tiny little pillows.


294
00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:34.522
And then I brought him into give him
a shower... well, a bath pretty much,


295
00:22:34.642 --> 00:22:39.398
but I gave him a bath in a shot glass.
And I washed his arse first,


296
00:22:39.517 --> 00:22:43.818
and then I thought that his head
would need to be washed. And he died.


297
00:22:43.933 --> 00:22:45.981
I drowned him.

298
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.434
He was dead when he came out
of the fucking shot glass.


299
00:22:50.517 --> 00:22:51.609
It's true.

300
00:22:51.725 --> 00:22:52.817
What age were you?

301
00:22:52.933 --> 00:22:55.482
About four or five. 
Fucking killed him.

302
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.774
All I was trying to do
was give him a bath as well.


303
00:22:58.892 --> 00:23:03.352
Washed his head for too long...
and he drowned in a shot glass.


304
00:23:04.058 --> 00:23:07.483
Fucking hell,
that is not a nice way to go.


305
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.230
Apparently it's peaceful... to drown.

306
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.648
Being drowned in a shot glass?

307
00:23:14.892 --> 00:23:16.439
Yeah, I'd say he loved it.

308
00:23:16.558 --> 00:23:19.357
How do gerbils usually wash?

309
00:23:30.725 --> 00:23:32.352
Are you OK?

310
00:23:32.475 --> 00:23:33.772
Uh-huh.

311
00:24:52.058 --> 00:24:56.268
And I wrote, like, something like,
"They were dawdling,"


312
00:24:56.392 --> 00:24:59.566
and everyone started laughing at me,
saying I made up that word.


313
00:24:59.683 --> 00:25:03.017
And I was like,
"That is definitely a word."


314
00:25:03.933 --> 00:25:06.231
- You made it up.
- No, it is a word.


315
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.524
Like, weird shit happens sometimes.

316
00:25:09.642 --> 00:25:11.235
- Do you know?
- Yeah, that...


317
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.433
One night when I was going to sleep,
my wardrobe opened by itself


318
00:25:14.558 --> 00:25:17.482
and all the shit fell out of my wardrobe
onto my bed.


319
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.944
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that was weird.


320
00:25:20.058 --> 00:25:24.017
That would... I wouldn't be able
to sleep. That's real creepy.


321
00:25:24.142 --> 00:25:28.352
I slept with my mam then
for about, like, a month after that.


322
00:25:28.475 --> 00:25:30.603
- What age were you?
- About seven or eight.


323
00:25:30.725 --> 00:25:31.977
Aw.

324
00:25:42.517 --> 00:25:44.019
Quick.

325
00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:48.898
Its a really big house, like
a plantation house down in the country


326
00:25:49.017 --> 00:25:51.111
with loads of land and horses

327
00:25:51.225 --> 00:25:53.853
and fields and trees and rivers
and shit around it.


328
00:25:53.975 --> 00:25:56.524
- And is there a fence?
- No.


329
00:25:56.642 --> 00:26:00.442
OK. You're at the kitchen table.
What's in front of you?


330
00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:02.231
Erm...

331
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:07.151
My mum and dad and my grandparents
and a few of the lads, I'd say.


332
00:26:07.267 --> 00:26:08.610
- That's nice.
- Yeah?


333
00:26:08.725 --> 00:26:11.524
The size of the house
is supposed to be, like,


334
00:26:11.642 --> 00:26:15.226
symbolic of your ambitions
in life and stuff.


335
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.775
And if you have a fence,
it means you're, like,


336
00:26:18.892 --> 00:26:22.146
- closed off from people and stuff.
- Sweet, I've no fence.


337
00:26:22.267 --> 00:26:27.023
And with your friends around the table
and stuff, that's real nice.


338
00:26:27.142 --> 00:26:30.112
Like, warm, sociable,
people around you all the time.


339
00:26:36.433 --> 00:26:39.642
Are you gonna play
professionally and study full time?


340
00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:42.896
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

341
00:26:43.017 --> 00:26:45.486
You're like the Rose of fucking Tralee.

342
00:26:46.183 --> 00:26:49.107
I thought it was good
to be ambitious. Isn't it?


343
00:26:49.892 --> 00:26:51.235
Or isn't it?

344
00:26:52.183 --> 00:26:54.356
You've got everything worked out.

345
00:27:17.267 --> 00:27:19.110
' Hi
' Hi.


346
00:27:19.225 --> 00:27:20.272
Oh, my God.

347
00:27:20.392 --> 00:27:22.269
- I haven't seen you in so long.
- I know!


348
00:27:22.392 --> 00:27:23.689
- Hey.
- How are you?


349
00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:25.981
Oisin not joining us?

350
00:27:26.975 --> 00:27:28.648
No. He's not.

351
00:27:28.767 --> 00:27:30.610
Oh, dear.

352
00:27:30.725 --> 00:27:33.695
He's gorgeous, great body,
just brain-dead.


353
00:27:33.808 --> 00:27:36.186
What did I say, man? Farrelly.

354
00:27:38.058 --> 00:27:40.277
Oh, my God. Guys!

355
00:27:43.892 --> 00:27:46.566
I thought they were just
the one-time deal, man.


356
00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:51.856
Interesting development yourself.

357
00:27:58.308 --> 00:28:00.902
- She's a big girl.
- Yeah, I know.


358
00:28:02.392 --> 00:28:03.439
Play nice.

359
00:28:07.725 --> 00:28:09.853
Alright guys?

360
00:28:09.975 --> 00:28:11.067
Yeah.

361
00:28:11.183 --> 00:28:14.312
- I'll leave you to it.
- It's OK. Stay.


362
00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:22.855
Give us a minute.

363
00:28:23.975 --> 00:28:26.148
Yeah. Sure.

364
00:28:29.225 --> 00:28:31.694
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine.


365
00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.444
- You alright'?
- Hm-hmm.


366
00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:46.275
- Give us a shot of your cig, will you?
- You're not supposed to be smoking.


367
00:28:46.392 --> 00:28:48.235
Just give us a shot.

368
00:28:50.225 --> 00:28:51.693
Thanks, Eimear.

369
00:29:21.683 --> 00:29:23.356
- How's it going?
- You alright?


370
00:29:23.475 --> 00:29:26.103
- Just pay with a card, please?
- Yeah, pop it in there.


371
00:29:30.683 --> 00:29:32.981
Hey, Con. How are you?

372
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.943
Hey, Rich.

373
00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:38.602
Your PIN.

374
00:29:42.683 --> 00:29:43.730
Nice top, man.

375
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.273
- That's a good look for you.
- Yeah?


376
00:29:48.183 --> 00:29:50.561
- Thanks, man. Cheers.
- Thanks a lot, dude.


377
00:29:50.683 --> 00:29:52.435
- Take it easy, Con, yeah?
- See you.


378
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.729
The joke is, the guard
goes over to the guy and says,


379
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:02.230
"Take your hands out of your fucking
pockets." But my mum tells it like this.


380
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.684
"And he says, '
Stop masticating."'

381
00:30:05.808 --> 00:30:09.062
"And he goes over and says,
'Stop masturbating."'


382
00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:11.769
We're going,

383
00:30:11.892 --> 00:30:15.977
"Mum, the whole point of the joke
is that you don't use the word."


384
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.273
Anyway, that's my mum
trying to tell a joke.


385
00:30:18.392 --> 00:30:20.770
She's about as subtle
as a train wreck.


386
00:30:23.017 --> 00:30:24.940
It was very funny, though.

387
00:30:29.308 --> 00:30:32.642
So, what do you wanna do
when you finish, at some point?


388
00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:34.735
Erm, I'm not really sure yet.

389
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.480
So I think I'll just do arts in college,
and hopefully...


390
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.728
- You'll just do arts?
- By the end...


391
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.602
It's a good foundation, isn't it?

392
00:30:43.683 --> 00:30:46.402
- Yeah, it is.
- Choices later on.


393
00:31:20.017 --> 00:31:22.111
Are you OK?

394
00:31:22.225 --> 00:31:23.568
Tired.

395
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.525
- Did you enjoy tonight?
- Yeah, it was nice.


396
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.068
Hmm.

397
00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:35.235
You were quiet.

398
00:31:36.017 --> 00:31:37.610
I talked.

399
00:31:38.558 --> 00:31:41.357
To my mum, a bit.

400
00:31:41.475 --> 00:31:43.569
Your dad, too.

401
00:31:43.683 --> 00:31:45.731
Yeah, when you were asked stuff.

402
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.477
Why are you being mean?

403
00:31:50.392 --> 00:31:54.147
I'm not. I'm just saying it was
a bit one-sided, you know?


404
00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:56.736
I just wanted them
to get to know you a little.


405
00:31:57.725 --> 00:32:00.444
Thanks, you've made me feel worse.

406
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.318
I'm sure they loved you.

407
00:32:07.267 --> 00:32:09.315
You didn't. Why would they?

408
00:32:14.058 --> 00:32:18.985
I'm not giving out to you. You know,
like, I didn't mean to upset you.


409
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.650
Do you think it's easy, meeting
your mum and dad for the first time?


410
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:25.318
You're right.

411
00:32:26.725 --> 00:32:28.352
I'm sorry.

412
00:32:33.642 --> 00:32:35.440
I need to sleep.

413
00:32:56.392 --> 00:32:59.362
A whupping? You bought the ref,
everyone knows that.


414
00:32:59.475 --> 00:33:02.445
You're gonna thank me
for teaching you some humility.


415
00:33:02.558 --> 00:33:04.526
Anyone know
where we're going?


416
00:33:04.642 --> 00:33:06.235
- Hey, Niall.
- Hey, Eimear.


417
00:33:07.975 --> 00:33:11.354
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Yeah.


418
00:33:18.475 --> 00:33:20.148
- Are you OK?
- Sure.


419
00:33:26.642 --> 00:33:28.861
- New top?
- Oh, yeah.


420
00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:38.026
Suits you.

421
00:35:05.725 --> 00:35:08.478
Richard, I want you
to meet some people.


422
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.819
Guys, this is my boy.

423
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.353
Hi. How's it going? 
Richard Karlsen.

424
00:35:16.475 --> 00:35:18.352
Sorry. Sorry.

425
00:35:20.475 --> 00:35:22.603
He wasn't being rude, he's just wasted.

426
00:35:22.725 --> 00:35:24.853
Maybe I just need
some of what you've had.


427
00:35:24.975 --> 00:35:26.977
Maybe you do. It's really good.

428
00:35:28.308 --> 00:35:30.777
You don't have to be such an arsehole.

429
00:35:33.308 --> 00:35:35.026
Hey, Rich.

430
00:35:35.142 --> 00:35:36.769
Lovers' tiff?

431
00:35:37.808 --> 00:35:40.436
- Just bring her home, Jake, yeah?
- Whatever.


432
00:35:40.558 --> 00:35:42.526
- Sorry.
- Who are you?


433
00:35:42.642 --> 00:35:45.236
Too many people inside.
Daragh's freaking out.


434
00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.728
I've been in.
One more won't make a difference.


435
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.023
No, no way.

436
00:35:50.725 --> 00:35:52.398
Lara!

437
00:35:53.975 --> 00:35:55.773
- Lara!
- Lara!


438
00:35:55.892 --> 00:35:57.860
- Lara!
- I've been nice.


439
00:35:57.975 --> 00:36:00.524
Now fuck off or I'll call the guards,
alright?


440
00:36:01.975 --> 00:36:05.559
- What a fucking bell-end, isn't he?
- What?


441
00:36:05.683 --> 00:36:09.688
What are you gonna do, magic us in,
Jake? Jesus Christ, man.


442
00:36:13.683 --> 00:36:16.732
Open the fucking door! Come on!

443
00:36:17.892 --> 00:36:19.235
Open the door.

444
00:36:20.017 --> 00:36:21.564
Fuck's sake!

445
00:36:50.683 --> 00:36:52.936
- Hey, you alright?
- Fuck off.


446
00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:56.771
- What?
- You are in the shit.


447
00:36:56.892 --> 00:36:58.690
Where the fuck have you been?

448
00:36:59.767 --> 00:37:01.314
Puck's sake.

449
00:37:10.017 --> 00:37:11.610
Daddy's car!

450
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.194
Here, get the fuck down, will you?

451
00:37:19.308 --> 00:37:21.777
What the fuck is it to you?
You fucking arsehole.


452
00:37:27.892 --> 00:37:30.395
- Where did you go'?
- Answer your phone, you'd know.


453
00:37:30.517 --> 00:37:32.861
- Sorry?
- I rang you, like, 20 fucking times.


454
00:37:32.975 --> 00:37:35.649
- Rich, it was pretty loud in there.
- Do you mind?


455
00:37:36.975 --> 00:37:39.444
- Lara, are you OK?
- Conor, just get lost!


456
00:37:39.558 --> 00:37:41.356
I'm getting a cab. Night.

457
00:37:41.475 --> 00:37:45.105
Hang on a sec. Don't you
fucking show me up in front of him.


458
00:37:45.225 --> 00:37:48.308
- That's all you care about?
- I'm sorry, OK?


459
00:37:48.433 --> 00:37:51.767
I don't wanna talk.
I just wanna go home. Call you tomorrow.


460
00:37:51.892 --> 00:37:54.520
- I'll come with you.
- No. Not like that.


461
00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:58.027
Like what? Like what?

462
00:37:58.142 --> 00:38:00.691
Rich! You fucking sort this out
when you're sober.


463
00:38:00.808 --> 00:38:03.061
Fuck off, Conor!

464
00:38:03.183 --> 00:38:05.060
He's not so great now, is he?

465
00:38:05.183 --> 00:38:07.277
You fucking culchie cunt.

466
00:38:08.933 --> 00:38:10.685
Jesus!

467
00:38:10.808 --> 00:38:13.687
Richard, are you OK? Richard?

468
00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:15.276
Fuck off!

469
00:38:16.433 --> 00:38:18.527
No, leave him alone!

470
00:38:19.392 --> 00:38:21.520
Lara, are you OK?

471
00:38:31.183 --> 00:38:32.651
Fuck you!

472
00:38:35.183 --> 00:38:36.776
Come on, let's go!

473
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.897
Rich, come on!

474
00:39:33.725 --> 00:39:35.477
Oh, it walks.

475
00:39:48.558 --> 00:39:51.232
- Can I have the rest of your coffee?
- Sure.


476
00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:56.358
- What did you do to your nose?
- It was just Stevo dicking around.


477
00:39:56.475 --> 00:39:58.352
I think it's quite nice, though.

478
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.022
- Yeah?
- Hmm.


479
00:40:01.808 --> 00:40:03.355
Looks classy.

480
00:40:04.058 --> 00:40:06.026
- Want some breakfast?
- Maybe in a while.


481
00:40:06.142 --> 00:40:08.236
Gardal' launched a murder inquiry

482
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.775
after the body of an 18-year-old man
was found in the South Dublin area


483
00:40:11.892 --> 00:40:15.066
in the early hours of the morning.
The disco very of the victim...


484
00:40:15.183 --> 00:40:17.311
- You want this section?
- Just let me listen.


485
00:40:17.433 --> 00:40:20.812
Gardai were called to a disturbance
involving a number of youths


486
00:40:20.933 --> 00:40:24.187
outside a house party
in the Sandymount area of the city.


487
00:40:24.308 --> 00:40:26.777
Gardai have appealed
for anyone with information


488
00:40:26.892 --> 00:40:30.476
to contact the investigation team
at Irish Town Garda Station


489
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.562
or to call the Gerda freephone number
at 1800666111.


490
00:40:36.683 --> 00:40:38.811
The cloud computing company...

491
00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:40.276
Shite.

492
00:41:15.808 --> 00:41:17.435
Stephen?

493
00:42:21.558 --> 00:42:23.902
- Are you sure it was him?
- Yes, I'm fucking sure!


494
00:42:24.017 --> 00:42:25.314
Fuck!

495
00:42:29.225 --> 00:42:31.227
My mum told me after mass.

496
00:42:32.725 --> 00:42:35.979
- Does your mum know?
- No, I didn't tell my fucking mum.


497
00:42:37.392 --> 00:42:40.396
Fuck. Could you tell him?

498
00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:43.110
I fucking can't, man.

499
00:43:25.725 --> 00:43:27.443
We should have checked him.

500
00:43:30.767 --> 00:43:32.610
Put him in an ambulance.

501
00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:36.852
We're fucked.

502
00:43:38.142 --> 00:43:41.646
He got up and he walked away.
We didn't fucking know.


503
00:43:41.767 --> 00:43:43.610
Yeah, it was an accident.

504
00:43:45.558 --> 00:43:47.981
You fucking arsehole, man!

505
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:55.685
Con was shouting at the guy on the car.
Shoved him in full view of everybody.


506
00:43:55.808 --> 00:43:59.392
- Then he backed off.
- Just let him fucking speak, Cian.


507
00:43:59.517 --> 00:44:01.190
The guards were here.

508
00:44:04.225 --> 00:44:05.772
What did they say?

509
00:44:05.892 --> 00:44:08.975
- Anyone could have seen us with him.
- Who? Clo fucked off home.


510
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.273
She rang me
asking if I'd seen this brawl.


511
00:44:11.392 --> 00:44:13.440
That's what everyone was talking about.

512
00:44:13.558 --> 00:44:15.401
They have a list of names,

513
00:44:15.517 --> 00:44:18.111
people they thought
might have been at the party.


514
00:44:18.225 --> 00:44:20.227
Were you there?

515
00:44:20.975 --> 00:44:23.649
If we stick to our story,
nobody can touch us.


516
00:44:23.767 --> 00:44:25.144
Apart from Lara.

517
00:44:27.017 --> 00:44:29.019
Have you spoken to her yet?

518
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.853
- Rich!
- No.


519
00:44:34.892 --> 00:44:36.394
I will.

520
00:44:37.892 --> 00:44:39.144
OK.

521
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.193
Lara, hey, it's me.

522
00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.478
Just give me a
shout when you can. OK?

523
00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:02.193
Have the guards been to see you?

524
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.773
Come to take me away, then.

525
00:46:07.892 --> 00:46:10.771
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Did you tell them?


526
00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:17.650
- Well, what did you say?
- Jesus!


527
00:46:17.767 --> 00:46:21.442
- I just need to know what you said.
- I lied, OK?


528
00:46:21.558 --> 00:46:25.392
I said I left with Conor and went home
with you when they were fighting.


529
00:46:26.475 --> 00:46:28.694
I'm going to hell.

530
00:46:28.808 --> 00:46:32.608
- And you used my name?
- Fuck off, Richard.


531
00:46:39.142 --> 00:46:40.815
What did you do to him?

532
00:46:45.058 --> 00:46:47.481
Hey, it was an accident.

533
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.104
He was fine when we left.
He was getting up.


534
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.478
It was just this freak thing.

535
00:46:58.558 --> 00:47:01.232
I can't believe this is happening to me.

536
00:47:02.225 --> 00:47:04.478
You can only think of yourself?

537
00:47:13.683 --> 00:47:15.276
I'm sorry.

538
00:47:17.475 --> 00:47:19.227
I'm sorry.

539
00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:23.193
I just...

540
00:47:24.517 --> 00:47:26.360
My...

541
00:47:26.475 --> 00:47:28.318
My head's just...

542
00:47:30.183 --> 00:47:33.153
- Lara.
- I can't.


543
00:47:58.933 --> 00:48:01.561
Hey, Aisling. How are you?
It's Richard Karlsen here.


544
00:48:01.683 --> 00:48:03.777
Is there any chance
that my dad's around?


545
00:48:06.142 --> 00:48:08.236
OK, grand. I mean, if he's...

546
00:48:09.558 --> 00:48:12.107
Yeah. Great. I'll hold.

547
00:49:02.017 --> 00:49:03.690
Morning, Richard.

548
00:49:05.183 --> 00:49:07.185
Thank you so much
for coming in.


549
00:49:13.558 --> 00:49:16.482
I couldn't see because
a lot of people had come over


550
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.194
and were gathering around
to see what was going on.


551
00:49:19.308 --> 00:49:22.027
And where was Conor
during this?


552
00:49:22.142 --> 00:49:25.271
Again, I'd found my girlfriend
at that point


553
00:49:25.392 --> 00:49:29.772
and she was wanting to leave,
so... we went off together.


554
00:49:29.892 --> 00:49:32.486
And did you see Conor
at any stage after that?


555
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.601
No.

556
00:49:33.725 --> 00:49:37.605
I have to ask you, Richard,
how did you get that bruise?


557
00:49:37.725 --> 00:49:39.978
In training. I'm a rugby player.

558
00:50:12.308 --> 00:50:13.605
Hey.

559
00:50:15.683 --> 00:50:17.276
I'm glad you came.

560
00:50:21.392 --> 00:50:23.315
You're worried I'm gonna crack.

561
00:50:24.725 --> 00:50:26.727
That's why you wanted to do this.

562
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.852
Yeah.

563
00:50:34.767 --> 00:50:36.769
And I wanted to see you.

564
00:50:40.017 --> 00:50:41.610
I'm sorry.

565
00:50:43.767 --> 00:50:48.603
- I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
- You didn't make me hit him, OK.


566
00:50:56.683 --> 00:51:00.187
I haven't eaten in two days.
Do you wanna go and get some food?


567
00:51:00.308 --> 00:51:03.187
Please don't call me again. Right?

568
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.854
I don't want to have anything
to do with you. I just...


569
00:51:08.933 --> 00:51:11.152
- ..can't.
- Cian.


570
00:51:12.683 --> 00:51:15.892
Please. Just don't.

571
00:51:31.433 --> 00:51:34.152
- Aisling said you'd called.
- Yeah.


572
00:51:34.267 --> 00:51:36.690
I was... You just sounded
a bit busy, you know.


573
00:51:36.808 --> 00:51:38.151
Yeah, well...

574
00:51:40.808 --> 00:51:43.402
- Can I sit?
- Yeah, sure.


575
00:51:45.892 --> 00:51:47.269
Thank you.

576
00:51:48.808 --> 00:51:50.606
Thank you, kind sir.

577
00:51:59.142 --> 00:52:00.769
The tree house.

578
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.603
You were on and on about that,
you know?


579
00:52:06.725 --> 00:52:10.104
"Can we get a tree house?
When can we get a tree house?"


580
00:52:10.225 --> 00:52:12.899
You know, I just couldn't help you
at that point.


581
00:52:14.058 --> 00:52:17.358
I was... I wasn't up to it.

582
00:52:18.892 --> 00:52:23.227
So you just... started it yourself.

583
00:52:24.267 --> 00:52:28.022
You must have been, what, ten? Nine?

584
00:52:29.892 --> 00:52:33.101
Nine years. Nine years. 
Nine years old.

585
00:52:33.808 --> 00:52:35.185
You...

586
00:52:37.142 --> 00:52:40.271
...were dragging out the planks
from the shed


587
00:52:40.392 --> 00:52:46.149
and digging in the posts,
and eventually I had to help you, so...


588
00:52:50.058 --> 00:52:52.060
Remarkable little boy.

589
00:52:55.058 --> 00:52:57.311
You didn't let me drag you down.

590
00:53:01.225 --> 00:53:03.694
That's a great instinct, son.

591
00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:08.193
Don't change that now.

592
00:53:13.225 --> 00:53:14.772
Don't.

593
00:53:24.058 --> 00:53:29.064
I know that... your mates
mean everything to you, but...


594
00:53:32.183 --> 00:53:34.481
...there's gotta be a limit
to loyalty, son.


595
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.523
Dad... don't.

596
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.943
Were you there...

597
00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:49.727
...when it happened to Conor?

598
00:54:11.558 --> 00:54:13.276
It wasn't the fight they said.

599
00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:26.519
I was away from all that with Lara...
and we were having a row.


600
00:54:33.267 --> 00:54:35.019
Conor stepped in.

601
00:54:36.225 --> 00:54:38.853
He was just constantly all over her.

602
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:47.857
And... I told him to back off
and he hit me.


603
00:54:54.058 --> 00:54:59.815
So the lads jumped in...
just to sort him out.


604
00:55:01.933 --> 00:55:03.150
And...

605
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.568
...it just got out of hand.

606
00:55:14.392 --> 00:55:16.110
Which lads?

607
00:55:21.308 --> 00:55:23.151
Stephen and Cian.

608
00:55:32.683 --> 00:55:34.026
OK.

609
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.398
OK. OK.

610
00:55:47.225 --> 00:55:49.728
Good, son. Thank you.

611
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:51.942
Thank you.

612
00:55:55.308 --> 00:55:59.939
Dad, I did it. It was me. I kicked him
in the head and I killed him.


613
00:56:02.433 --> 00:56:04.686
No. No.

614
00:56:05.517 --> 00:56:06.689
No!

615
00:56:07.767 --> 00:56:10.361
No. No!

616
00:56:12.725 --> 00:56:15.444
I'm so sorry, Dad. I'm so sorry.

617
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:20.523
I killed him.

618
00:56:35.933 --> 00:56:38.652
No. No.

619
00:56:38.767 --> 00:56:40.440
What do I do?

620
00:57:10.392 --> 00:57:12.190
I'm sorry. I...

621
00:57:14.183 --> 00:57:15.605
I'm sorry.

622
00:58:04.558 --> 00:58:05.775
Hey.

623
00:58:29.225 --> 00:58:32.934
I've been thinking that maybe
you should go away for a while.


624
00:58:34.225 --> 00:58:35.977
Go to the beach house.

625
00:58:37.725 --> 00:58:40.569
- Sure, yeah. Of course.
- Yeah?


626
00:58:41.892 --> 00:58:43.189
Great.

627
00:58:45.933 --> 00:58:47.606
I'll let Mum know you're going.

628
00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.059
Bring your phone...
if I wanna get in contact.


629
01:03:10.808 --> 01:03:12.560
Dad.

630
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.523
Hey. Hey-

631
01:03:19.725 --> 01:03:21.352
So how have you been?

632
01:03:23.058 --> 01:03:24.401
Fine.

633
01:03:30.183 --> 01:03:31.810
I've been talking to somebody.

634
01:03:34.392 --> 01:03:36.144
I won't tell you who but...

635
01:03:39.142 --> 01:03:41.236
...it seems that the investigation

636
01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:45.776
is focusing on this thing with
the gate-crashers outside the house.


637
01:03:47.308 --> 01:03:50.767
And that there are
no separate inquiries or suspects.


638
01:04:00.308 --> 01:04:01.935
That's what he said.

639
01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:09.270
Dad, does Mum know about any of this?

640
01:04:09.392 --> 01:04:11.190
No.

641
01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:15.811
- No.
- Right.


642
01:04:19.433 --> 01:04:21.606
Can I come home now, Dad?
Is that OK?


643
01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:25.065
Yeah, of course.

644
01:04:33.183 --> 01:04:36.357
Your mother wants me to bring
the linen home, so...


645
01:05:06.892 --> 01:05:08.610
- Hey-
- Hey-


646
01:05:09.725 --> 01:05:13.605
- ls everybody inside?
- Don't worry, Dad's waiting for you.


647
01:05:13.725 --> 01:05:15.227
Come here.

648
01:05:18.308 --> 01:05:21.187
A few of us are going to the nets
if you wanna come down after.


649
01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:24.812
Listen, I should probably get inside,
OK? See you.


650
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.318
You alright, man?

651
01:05:48.392 --> 01:05:49.985
- Hey.
- Hey, Rich.


652
01:05:51.308 --> 01:05:53.231
- You alright'?
- How are you?


653
01:05:55.433 --> 01:05:56.901
Grab a few drinks there.

654
01:05:57.017 --> 01:05:58.439
You alright, Rich?

655
01:06:00.683 --> 01:06:02.481
(Pat? Have we all got a drink?

656
01:06:07.767 --> 01:06:09.519
$0, guys...

657
01:06:10.558 --> 01:06:12.936
...I know you're all hurting
at the moment.


658
01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:19.356
But we're a team and teams pull together
through the tough times.


659
01:06:21.142 --> 01:06:23.395
And I know you're all missing Conor,

660
01:06:23.517 --> 01:06:26.771
and you're all angry
about what happened to him,


661
01:06:26.892 --> 01:06:32.103
but for now, let's just take a moment
to say goodbye to a friend


662
01:06:32.225 --> 01:06:34.102
and a great team-mate.

663
01:06:35.017 --> 01:06:36.769
Goodbye to Conor.

664
01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:39.111
To Conor.

665
01:06:42.267 --> 01:06:46.477
Raglan men are we.

666
01:06:47.142 --> 01:06:51.022
Faithful to our call.

667
01:06:51.725 --> 01:06:56.105
Valiant' and brave we 're standing.

668
01:06:56.225 --> 01:07:00.105
Steadfast one and all.

669
01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:04.855
Victory is ours to claim.

670
01:07:04.975 --> 01:07:09.731
But honour is our goal.

671
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:14.356
We never will surrender truth.

672
01:07:14.475 --> 01:07:17.900
On this our sacred soil.

673
01:07:18.017 --> 01:07:20.770
Come on, Raglan! Come on!

674
01:07:20.892 --> 01:07:24.817
Come on, Raglan! Come on, Raglan!

675
01:07:24.933 --> 01:07:28.267
- Get in!
- Come on!


676
01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:37.150
- Seriously?
- That's what he said anyway.


677
01:07:40.517 --> 01:07:44.067
OK, come on. Let's go get wasted, man.

678
01:07:45.808 --> 01:07:48.937
- Think I'm just gonna go home, Steve.
- Come on.


679
01:07:50.517 --> 01:07:52.190
Another time, man.

680
01:07:53.142 --> 01:07:54.689
Alright.

681
01:07:54.808 --> 01:07:56.810
- I'll see you.
- See you later.


682
01:07:57.517 --> 01:07:59.770
Take it easy, lads. See youse.

683
01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:36.185
Oh, my God, what's this? D4 youngsters
drinking in the scrublands?


684
01:08:36.308 --> 01:08:38.276
Shock, horror.

685
01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:41.814
" Hey, you.
- Hey.


686
01:08:41.933 --> 01:08:43.810
- Party finished?
- Yeah.


687
01:08:44.558 --> 01:08:47.437
- Beers. Go for it, lads.
- Cheers, man.


688
01:08:48.517 --> 01:08:51.236
- Grab us one, Jake, will you?
- Yeah, sure.


689
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:53.603
- Sound.
- Cheers.


690
01:08:54.475 --> 01:08:56.398
How's it going, lads? You alright?

691
01:08:57.558 --> 01:08:59.686
Knacker drinking away.

692
01:09:01.017 --> 01:09:03.361
- So, you alright?
- Yeah.


693
01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.776
It's fucking mad.

694
01:09:12.433 --> 01:09:14.276
- Listen, man, are we cool?
- Yeah.


695
01:09:14.392 --> 01:09:17.191
- I was out of line.
- Don't worry about it, honestly.


696
01:09:17.308 --> 01:09:18.434
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


697
01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:20.856
Alright, man. Thanks.

698
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.103
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, no, I'm sorry.


699
01:09:24.933 --> 01:09:27.231
Fucking bad night, like.

700
01:09:31.725 --> 01:09:35.184
Have I come just a little bit
overdressed, maybe, guys?


701
01:09:35.308 --> 01:09:38.733
Just a small bit overdressed here,
I think, perhaps.


702
01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:41.649
- You got a fire going there, lads?
- No.


703
01:09:41.767 --> 01:09:43.019
Sweet one.

704
01:09:43.142 --> 01:09:46.225
They were all asking him questions
and he's going,


705
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:49.980
"Yeah, yeah," and then out of nowhere,
he just goes...


706
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:57.025
Hear about the guy who was playing rugby
and got one his balls ripped off?


707
01:09:57.142 --> 01:10:00.316
- This is an awful topic.
- It's a friend of mine's friend.


708
01:10:00.433 --> 01:10:02.902
He took a really high tackle
and there was, like,


709
01:10:03.017 --> 01:10:05.145
a whoosh and just... 
One of his balls...

710
01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:07.611
It was apparently dangling
by the string.


711
01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:08.851
No, stop it. Stop it.

712
01:10:08.975 --> 01:10:12.184
Sorry, man.

713
01:10:16.975 --> 01:10:20.184
So disgusting.
They were like, "Why is he screaming?"


714
01:10:20.308 --> 01:10:23.892
- I got a splinter.
- Where? Let's see.


715
01:10:26.017 --> 01:10:29.191
Oh, my God. Shit.
Have you tried getting it out?


716
01:10:30.142 --> 01:10:33.567
Yes. Can you not see that I've gored it?
Look at the state of it.


717
01:10:33.683 --> 01:10:36.436
- You did it badly. I'd know.
- Would you?


718
01:10:36.558 --> 01:10:39.357
- Yeah.
- You're the Queen of Splinters?


719
01:10:56.683 --> 01:10:59.653
Alright. I'm gonna head. School.

720
01:10:59.767 --> 01:11:02.395
Oh, right, take it easy, man.
See you later on, right?


721
01:11:02.517 --> 01:11:04.690
- Bye, honey.
- See you.


722
01:11:29.558 --> 01:11:31.310
Oh, my God.

723
01:11:33.267 --> 01:11:34.860
Whoa.

724
01:11:38.225 --> 01:11:39.818
I have to pee.

725
01:12:00.933 --> 01:12:03.607
"A great prophet has appeared
among us," they said.


726
01:12:03.725 --> 01:12:06.023
"God has come to help his people."

727
01:12:06.975 --> 01:12:09.945
This news about Jesus
spread throughout Judea


728
01:12:10.058 --> 01:12:11.901
and the surrounding country.

729
01:12:12.808 --> 01:12:14.981
This is the Gospel of the Lord.

730
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.694
Praise be the Lord, Jesus Christ.

731
01:12:17.808 --> 01:12:19.355
Please be seated.

732
01:12:25.433 --> 01:12:27.106
Dear friends...

733
01:12:40.392 --> 01:12:44.067
- Eileen.
- It's wrong.


734
01:12:44.183 --> 01:12:47.687
I know. Just have a seat.

735
01:12:47.808 --> 01:12:49.981
I won't.

736
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.024
Things need to be said.

737
01:12:57.017 --> 01:13:02.774
There were dozens of kids outside
that house when Conor was killed.


738
01:13:03.475 --> 01:13:05.318
A lot would be here.

739
01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:10.106
But do you know...

740
01:13:11.767 --> 01:13:18.605
...how many were decent enough...
to come forward with information?


741
01:13:21.392 --> 01:13:23.065
A handful.

742
01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.443
Three.

743
01:13:27.433 --> 01:13:29.231
Four.

744
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:30.602
Maybe.

745
01:13:34.017 --> 01:13:41.105
Are you telling me...
nobody else remembers anything?


746
01:13:44.933 --> 01:13:46.935
Nobody else knows...

747
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.318
...who killed...

748
01:13:51.558 --> 01:13:53.231
...my boy?

749
01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.477
Nobody else...

750
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.777
...suspects their own... safe son?

751
01:14:10.808 --> 01:14:12.606
You know.

752
01:14:15.392 --> 01:14:19.272
I know.. you know.

753
01:14:22.433 --> 01:14:29.271
And you're breaking our hearts again...
for not speaking up.


754
01:15:50.517 --> 01:15:52.519
I'm gonna hand myself in.

755
01:15:58.975 --> 01:16:00.977
It's what I have to do.

756
01:16:01.767 --> 01:16:03.565
Jesus, Richard.

757
01:16:04.808 --> 01:16:08.813
Lara... it's the only way.

758
01:17:05.725 --> 01:17:08.399
Then we could just take off'
after, you know?


759
01:17:10.975 --> 01:17:13.319
Have completely diffierent lives.

760
01:17:31.308 --> 01:17:33.481
God, I can breathe.

761
01:17:41.183 --> 01:17:46.064
- You make it sound so easy.
- It is easy. We 'l just do it.


762
01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:54.350
We 'll go to France. Spain.

763
01:17:55.475 --> 01:17:56.818
Wherever.

764
01:17:58.058 --> 01:18:00.857
- Where do you wanna go?
- Everywhere.


765
01:19:06.850 --> 01:19:08.397
Hey.

766
01:19:09.850 --> 01:19:11.272
Hi.

767
01:19:15.308 --> 01:19:17.310
I'll just tidy up a bit.

768
01:19:54.683 --> 01:19:55.935
Bye.

769
01:21:54.017 --> 01:21:56.941
If a party commits
a major breach of contract,


770
01:21:57.058 --> 01:21:59.777
whether or not that party
can end the contract


771
01:21:59.892 --> 01:22:02.236
depends on the surrounding...
