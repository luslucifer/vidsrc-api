00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:31.691
Gentlemen and gentlemen,
Mr. Mark Vanderhill!


3
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.099
Men first! Men first!
Men first! Men first!


4
00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:39.267
- Mark.
- Mark.


5
00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.334
- I freakin' love you.
- Thank you.


6
00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:41.302
You the fuckin' man.

7
00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:42.702
- You, ha-ha!
- Love you.


8
00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:44.771
The way you changed
my fuckin' life.


9
00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:47.674
I have a message to spread
that I believe


10
00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:50.610
can save thousands
if not millions of lives.


11
00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:52.579
I owe everything to you, man.

12
00:00:52.712 --> 00:00:54.949
He understands what I'm about,
and that's why I joined his movement.


13
00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.884
We're a movement
that remains prepared.


14
00:00:57.018 --> 00:00:59.353
Mark, you taught me how to
reclaim my power as a man.


15
00:00:59.486 --> 00:01:01.923
You see it, you want it,
you take it.


16
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:04.491
Setting the example.

17
00:01:04.624 --> 00:01:06.394
Mark saved me from
being a beta male.


18
00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:07.661
That's natural.

19
00:01:07.794 --> 00:01:08.996
That's an expression
of dominance.


20
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.198
The most important thing
that has happened...


21
00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:12.432
It's a natural movement.

22
00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:13.800
...is the creation
of the MFM.


23
00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:15.069
MFM.

24
00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:16.370
MFM, baby.

25
00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:19.773
The male exerts dominance
over the female.


26
00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:21.909
It's fucking science!

27
00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:24.912
Oh, he's so sexist. Oh!

28
00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:26.646
- Fuck these hos.
- Shut the fuck up.


29
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.883
Well, feminists claim
they want equality,


30
00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:30.817
but what they really want
is power.


31
00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:32.852
- "No" don't mean "no."
- "No" means try harder.


32
00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:35.755
<i>This is the sort of imagery the
liberal media doesn't want you to see.</i>


33
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.994
<i>White, straight men
enjoying themselves.</i>


34
00:01:40.127 --> 00:01:42.696
That's when those fucking
liberal pansies are gonna listen.


35
00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.365
- And if they don't...
- Boom!


36
00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:47.734
- Boom.
- My M4 Carbine rifle will do the talkin' for you.


37
00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:51.105
Time to show these snowflakes
who's fuckin' boss!


38
00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:54.275
You wanna know what we think
about your sensitive politics


39
00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:55.876
and these issues, yeah?

40
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.478
Fuckin' that's what we think!

41
00:03:19.393 --> 00:03:21.195
- All right.
- Thanks.


42
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.697
You goin' huntin'?

43
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:28.536
Oh, I just like
to stay prepared.


44
00:03:28.668 --> 00:03:30.237
Okay, there's nothing
wrong with that.


45
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.704
Can I get a...

46
00:03:31.838 --> 00:03:33.573
A cheeseburger deluxe,
bloody rare,


47
00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:35.142
with barbecue sauce
on the side?


48
00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:36.643
Hey, you know
your girl's order.


49
00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:38.145
Yeah, I know
everybody's order.


50
00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:40.647
Um, well, I'm gonna throw
a curveball at you


51
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.284
and get a slice
of cherry pie.


52
00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:44.717
Honestly?

53
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:47.854
The cherry pie
is, like, kinda trash.


54
00:03:47.988 --> 00:03:49.823
It's just like Foster's
and they microwave it.


55
00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:51.525
But the key lime pie
is homemade.


56
00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:53.160
Key lime sounds great.

57
00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:54.627
All right, key lime.

58
00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.100
Joey.

59
00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:00.935
- Mike!
- Hey.


60
00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:02.002
- Hey!
- Hey.


61
00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:02.802
What...

62
00:04:02.937 --> 00:04:04.038
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hi!


63
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:05.672
- It's so good to see you.
- You too!


64
00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:07.174
You look amazing!

65
00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:08.876
Oh! Well, thank you.

66
00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.511
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:14.747
Um, I got into law school,
um, so my social life is over.


68
00:04:14.882 --> 00:04:15.883
- Wanted to...
- Okay.


69
00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:17.084
...come hang for a bit,
yeah.


70
00:04:17.218 --> 00:04:18.651
So I graduated
a semester early.


71
00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:20.787
- Cool. Good for you.
- What about you?


72
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.325
You know, just...
I'm just here.


73
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.361
- It's... It's awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome.


74
00:04:27.495 --> 00:04:29.497
Um, I'm havin' a party tonight.
Totally come.


75
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.633
It's gonna be just bonfire
and drinks and... yeah.


76
00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:35.503
Sure. That sounds fun, okay.

77
00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:37.037
- Okay.
- Okay.


78
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:38.973
- Well, I'll get out of your way.
- Okay. Okay, cool.


79
00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:40.740
Yeah, I'll see you later.

80
00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:42.009
- Okay.
- See you.


81
00:04:42.143 --> 00:04:43.043
Bye.

82
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.380
- Uh, we good?
- Yeah.


83
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:50.017
Roll, roll, roll it.
I'm feelin' it.


84
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:51.285
And we're back, fellas.

85
00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:53.853
It's Mark Vanderhill,
your b-b-boy.


86
00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:56.957
Dr. Vanderhill here,
Vanderhill Files, part two.


87
00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:59.393
Two. T
-Two. Part two. Two.

88
00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:02.029
In the field. All right, I wanna
review part one really fast


89
00:05:02.163 --> 00:05:03.663
'cause it's important.

90
00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:05.866
We talked about
identifying a target.


91
00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:08.068
Ta... Ta... Tar... Target.

92
00:05:22.815 --> 00:05:24.118
Janine is pregnant again.

93
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:26.153
- Alan and Marie's daughter?
- Mm-hmm.


94
00:05:26.287 --> 00:05:28.755
- She just had one!
- I don't know why you surprised.


95
00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.757
Alan and Marie
had 11 children.


96
00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:32.692
They must think pretty high
of themselves,


97
00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:35.429
assuming the world needs
that much of them in it.


98
00:05:35.563 --> 00:05:37.231
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, baby.


99
00:05:37.364 --> 00:05:38.666
Ooh, I'm hungry!

100
00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:41.235
Not too hungry to say grace.

101
00:05:43.537 --> 00:05:44.605
The dishwasher
broke at work,


102
00:05:44.737 --> 00:05:46.140
so Marco's got us
hand washing,


103
00:05:46.273 --> 00:05:48.008
which is unfair,
'cause that's not my job.


104
00:05:48.142 --> 00:05:49.977
It's not unfair, baby.
That's work.


105
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.145
Whoa, wait, wait a minute.

106
00:05:51.278 --> 00:05:53.614
She a waitress,
not a dishwasher.


107
00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:55.616
Now, Marco want her
to do more work,


108
00:05:55.748 --> 00:05:58.319
- he need to give her more money.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you, Pop.


109
00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:01.121
You're gonna spoil her mind
with that talk.


110
00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:03.958
Marco's a bully.
Always has been.


111
00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:05.792
You push right back
at him.


112
00:06:05.926 --> 00:06:07.194
- Oh!
- I will, Pop.


113
00:06:07.328 --> 00:06:09.196
Vanderhill Files, part two.
We're in field.


114
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.298
We talked about opener. Do you know
about the Vanderhill technique?


115
00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:12.799
Sorry, don't mean
to alarm you.


116
00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:14.501
Just... I gravitated
towards you.


117
00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:16.270
Feels like you could
use a little somethin'.


118
00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:18.872
You're a little messy,
but, you know, you're cute.


119
00:06:19.006 --> 00:06:20.207
- Can you cook?
- No.


120
00:06:20.341 --> 00:06:22.109
Oh, well, then that's
enough of that.


121
00:06:22.243 --> 00:06:24.278
- You're beautiful, I mean...
- Thank you.


122
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:26.779
All the makeup. Is this your
natural skin tone or is it...


123
00:06:26.914 --> 00:06:28.582
Is it a little darker
without the makeup?


124
00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:30.284
Can I see?

125
00:06:30.417 --> 00:06:33.020
You saw the negging work.
Negging kicks ass.


126
00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:36.624
Neg... Neg... Negging.

127
00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:37.925
<i>Like you saw it, right?</i>

128
00:06:38.058 --> 00:06:39.426
You saw it, right?
Right? Right? Right?


129
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.794
I wanna show it to you
and I wanna give it to you,


130
00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:44.632
so that you can use this tonight.

131
00:06:48.936 --> 00:06:50.904
Yes.

132
00:06:51.038 --> 00:06:54.108
Got you there. Nope.
You wish, motherfucker.


133
00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:55.409
What about you?

134
00:06:55.542 --> 00:06:58.012
You're not planning
on serving coffee


135
00:06:58.145 --> 00:07:00.514
for the rest of your life,
are you?


136
00:07:00.648 --> 00:07:02.116
Um...

137
00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:04.485
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
I did not mean that like that.


138
00:07:04.618 --> 00:07:06.253
No. No, you're not wrong.

139
00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:10.891
I, um... I thought
about being a nurse.


140
00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:13.793
You can get your license
without going to college.


141
00:07:13.927 --> 00:07:16.163
Um, I know. That's weird.

142
00:07:16.297 --> 00:07:19.566
Uh, so, yeah, I...
I can do online classes


143
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.800
and still go to school.

144
00:07:20.934 --> 00:07:23.270
Oh, no, go to work.

145
00:07:25.105 --> 00:07:26.540
That sounds like... That...

146
00:07:26.674 --> 00:07:29.176
I mean, that sounds like
something you'd be amazing at.


147
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.545
You'd be great at that.

148
00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:32.812
Thanks.

149
00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:44.491
I feel kind of sick.

150
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:45.993
I need to go home.

151
00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:48.729
You can crash here
if you want.


152
00:07:48.862 --> 00:07:51.598
I like you
and I'm having fun,


153
00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:54.868
but... I need to go.

154
00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:56.737
Okay.

155
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.972
- Um, let me walk you home, okay?
- Okay.


156
00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:14.955
<i>I'm pretty sure
I pulled out in time,</i>


157
00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:17.691
<i>but just in case,</i>

158
00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:20.561
you should probably
take Plan B.


159
00:08:21.862 --> 00:08:23.163
Bye.

160
00:08:43.417 --> 00:08:45.119
No.

161
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:49.056
<i>No.</i>

162
00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:54.461
<i>Joey.</i>

163
00:09:02.236 --> 00:09:05.072
So maybe there's
somethin' here after all,


164
00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:06.540
despite the faults?

165
00:09:06.673 --> 00:09:08.709
All right. And that's...

166
00:09:08.842 --> 00:09:10.177
Right on my heart line.

167
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.345
And...

168
00:09:12.212 --> 00:09:14.415
- And your name was?
- Tanya.


169
00:09:14.548 --> 00:09:16.016
Tanya.

170
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.352
Mark. Mark Vanderhill.

171
00:09:19.219 --> 00:09:21.021
Right, and that's
how we do it, right?


172
00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:23.123
It's simple. It's easy.
It's nothing you have to think about.


173
00:10:07.768 --> 00:10:09.169
Joey.

174
00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:29.323
What happened?

175
00:10:29.456 --> 00:10:33.560
I just hurt my hand.
Nana fixed me.


176
00:10:33.694 --> 00:10:35.696
How you doing, Joe?

177
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:38.632
Just powering through.

178
00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:43.437
<i>You sound like Nana talkin'.</i>

179
00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:52.045
<i>You know that strength that
your grandmother talked about?</i>


180
00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:54.114
<i>That's how she survived.</i>

181
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.019
<i>But it was also
her only option.</i>


182
00:11:01.822 --> 00:11:03.190
I know.

183
00:11:03.323 --> 00:11:05.225
She dealt with
it by dealin' with it,


184
00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:07.361
<i>whatever it was.</i>

185
00:11:07.494 --> 00:11:10.230
That don't mean
the same go for you.


186
00:11:10.364 --> 00:11:13.333
There's different ways
to show strength.


187
00:11:30.817 --> 00:11:31.953
That's all?

188
00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:33.453
A cup of coffee,
black and sweet.


189
00:11:33.587 --> 00:11:35.088
- Okay.
- Just how God made you.


190
00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:48.135
Joey!

191
00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:53.674
Sorry. Sorry, um...

192
00:11:53.807 --> 00:11:57.744
It's okay. It's all good.
It's... It's all good.


193
00:11:57.879 --> 00:11:59.179
Yeah, yeah.

194
00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:01.081
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.


195
00:12:01.214 --> 00:12:03.817
I just...
Can I get you a, um...


196
00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:16.129
Jesus.

197
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.705
Thanks.

198
00:12:24.838 --> 00:12:26.640
No problem.

199
00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:29.911
You okay?

200
00:12:30.044 --> 00:12:31.378
Yeah, I'm fine.

201
00:12:35.382 --> 00:12:38.452
Oh, I'm sorry.

202
00:12:38.987 --> 00:12:41.154
Um, uh, no.

203
00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:45.859
Uh, I am not fine.

204
00:12:45.994 --> 00:12:47.661
You got plans tonight?

205
00:12:47.794 --> 00:12:50.430
Um, no,
it's been a long work week.


206
00:12:50.564 --> 00:12:53.034
Come get a drink with me.

207
00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:55.402
I'm not really
in a social mood.


208
00:12:57.137 --> 00:12:58.940
Well, if you change
your mind,


209
00:12:59.073 --> 00:13:00.741
I'll be at yours at 8:00.

210
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:07.381
<i>They use their
front legs to snare their prey</i>


211
00:13:07.514 --> 00:13:09.583
<i>with reflexes so quick</i>

212
00:13:09.716 --> 00:13:12.285
<i>they are difficult to see
with the naked eye.</i>


213
00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:14.588
<i>This poor male cricket...</i>

214
00:13:15.822 --> 00:13:17.190
Hey, Nana, I'm goin' out.

215
00:13:17.324 --> 00:13:19.027
Okay.
Who you goin' out with?


216
00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:20.193
Uh, someone I met at work.

217
00:13:20.327 --> 00:13:21.828
What's her name?

218
00:13:21.963 --> 00:13:24.098
<i>...its prey,
camouflaged by the green...</i>


219
00:13:24.231 --> 00:13:25.599
I don't know.

220
00:13:25.732 --> 00:13:27.334
You don't know
your friend's name?


221
00:13:27.467 --> 00:13:29.603
What kind of person
doesn't tell you their name?


222
00:13:34.808 --> 00:13:38.745
You know, you can come up and knock
on the door like normal folks!


223
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.082
- Sorry.
- My gran.


224
00:13:41.214 --> 00:13:43.216
- It's all good. Get in.
- Yeah.


225
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.851
Go inside!

226
00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:03.905
I feel like I should tell you
that, um...


227
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:08.842
...I'm not gay.

228
00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:15.282
Okay. I'm not tryin'
to sleep with you.


229
00:14:15.415 --> 00:14:17.384
I just want to
show you something.


230
00:14:17.517 --> 00:14:20.287
- Show me what?
- You'll see.


231
00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:29.931
What's she singin' about?

232
00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:33.533
Revenge.

233
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.234
I'm confused.
This is where we're havin' a drink?


234
00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:07.935
Yeah. Come on.

235
00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:53.780
Hello.

236
00:15:57.584 --> 00:15:59.820
Fala, this is Joey.
Joey, this is Fala.


237
00:15:59.954 --> 00:16:02.355
- This is her home.
- Hi, I'm Josephine.


238
00:16:02.489 --> 00:16:04.292
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.


239
00:16:04.424 --> 00:16:06.994
Oh. Oh.

240
00:16:08.296 --> 00:16:09.964
All right,
come on, bitch.


241
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.599
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.


242
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.569
You want it
to have power.


243
00:16:15.702 --> 00:16:17.604
You're right, Fala.

244
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.289
Is this like a secret bar
or somethin'?


245
00:16:35.422 --> 00:16:37.959
Well, um, actually,
this place is usually pretty quiet,


246
00:16:38.092 --> 00:16:41.095
but some of our friends are getting
married, so it's about to get wild.


247
00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:42.762
You want to go
to that too!


248
00:16:42.897 --> 00:16:45.832
I do, but, girl,
it's just the way how we gotta do this.


249
00:16:46.267 --> 00:16:47.701
'Sup, Reggie?

250
00:16:47.834 --> 00:16:49.036
Hi, guys.

251
00:18:12.987 --> 00:18:14.021
Hello.

252
00:18:14.155 --> 00:18:16.023
Can I have two whiskeys?

253
00:18:21.996 --> 00:18:24.098
Don't worry.
We don't bite.


254
00:18:24.231 --> 00:18:25.632
Thanks.

255
00:18:29.536 --> 00:18:30.570
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


256
00:18:32.273 --> 00:18:34.574
Ah.

257
00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:36.710
How was that?

258
00:18:36.843 --> 00:18:38.379
Good.

259
00:18:40.414 --> 00:18:42.649
This is crazy.

260
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:44.584
But do you work here?

261
00:18:44.718 --> 00:18:47.922
No, um,
I work for Sal and Fala.


262
00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:50.324
We help people get out
of bad relationships,


263
00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:53.294
get off the street,
um, teach self-defense classes.


264
00:18:53.427 --> 00:18:54.527
Stuff like that.

265
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:56.897
All right, bitches!

266
00:18:58.265 --> 00:19:01.235
It's time for Hexus!

267
00:19:01.369 --> 00:19:03.137

268
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.107

00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:39.867
Hey, Reg,
check out what Lily made.


294
00:20:40.767 --> 00:20:42.937
Fully functioning
EMP grenade.


295
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.272
Ooh!

296
00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:46.941
This will come in handy.

297
00:20:50.277 --> 00:20:52.246
Who's the cupcake?

298
00:20:53.847 --> 00:20:56.016
Oh, uh, that's Joey.
She's my friend.


299
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.219
- She needs to use your bathroom.
- Yeah.


300
00:21:01.522 --> 00:21:02.890
Hey.

301
00:21:31.051 --> 00:21:34.922
- I gotta run an errand. You want to come with?
- Yeah.


302
00:21:35.923 --> 00:21:37.892
What is
all of this stuff?


303
00:21:38.025 --> 00:21:40.827
Careful.
This is a pin camera, okay?


304
00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:42.863
It records video, audio,

305
00:21:42.997 --> 00:21:45.765
basically makes secrets
not so secret.


306
00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:48.068
Right.

307
00:21:48.202 --> 00:21:50.404
Hey, let's go.

308
00:21:59.313 --> 00:22:00.414
What did she say?

309
00:22:00.548 --> 00:22:03.384
Oh, uh, she said that
you're a good dancer.


310
00:22:03.517 --> 00:22:04.717
Oh. Thank you.

311
00:22:04.851 --> 00:22:07.021
Yeah, we're goin'
back there.


312
00:22:08.855 --> 00:22:10.257
You got it.

313
00:22:47.027 --> 00:22:50.564
Hey, will you wait here?
Babushka's kind of weird with new people.


314
00:22:50.698 --> 00:22:51.932
Yeah.

315
00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:56.070
Babushka, we're comin' in!

316
00:22:56.203 --> 00:22:59.806
Don't shoot, Babushka.
It's Regina and Beatrice.


317
00:23:02.109 --> 00:23:03.377
Let's go, Babbo.

318
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.678
Hey, Babbo.

319
00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:06.013
I'll tell you right now,

320
00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:08.916
this stuff was not easy
to come by.


321
00:23:11.285 --> 00:23:12.586
My cardigan?

322
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.089
I like your, um...
all your patches.


323
00:23:17.024 --> 00:23:19.826
You're wild, Babbo.
Okay, we gotta go.


324
00:23:25.366 --> 00:23:26.400
Let's go.

325
00:23:29.336 --> 00:23:31.905
I'd tell you to be careful
with that stuff,


326
00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:34.642
but it only affects the Y chromosome.

327
00:23:34.774 --> 00:23:36.477
You girls have a good trip.

328
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.312
We will, Babbo.

329
00:23:38.445 --> 00:23:41.015
- And be sure and pull over if you're gonna sleep.
- We will, Babbo!


330
00:23:41.148 --> 00:23:45.252
If you stop by Milfred Farm, pick me
up some of that strawberry moonshine.


331
00:23:45.386 --> 00:23:47.187
- We will, Babbo!
- We will, Babbo!


332
00:23:47.321 --> 00:23:49.822
One, two, three.

333
00:23:51.659 --> 00:23:53.826
Crazy cat.

334
00:24:11.945 --> 00:24:13.213
You want anything?

335
00:24:13.347 --> 00:24:15.883
- No, thanks.
- Yup. I'm good.


336
00:24:16.016 --> 00:24:17.850
I'm gonna take a leak.

337
00:24:47.881 --> 00:24:49.583
Unfucking real!

338
00:24:49.717 --> 00:24:52.553
You're gonna embarrass me like that.
Are you fucking serious? Huh?


339
00:24:53.554 --> 00:24:55.122
Hey!

340
00:24:55.255 --> 00:24:57.825
Look at me,
you fucking drunk!


341
00:24:57.958 --> 00:25:00.027
Jesus Christ, you're sloppy!

342
00:25:03.097 --> 00:25:05.332
Maybe you made your point,
yeah?


343
00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:09.036
Nobody asked you,
soul sister.


344
00:25:10.003 --> 00:25:11.605
Doesn't seem like
she's arguing much.


345
00:25:11.739 --> 00:25:14.208
She's not arguing
because she's a fucking idiot.


346
00:25:14.341 --> 00:25:16.944
Lucky I don't smack her
in the mouth.


347
00:25:22.516 --> 00:25:25.519
Honestly, you're lucky I don't
smack you in the fucking mouth.


348
00:25:25.652 --> 00:25:27.488
I'd like to see you try.

349
00:25:29.022 --> 00:25:31.625
Fucking bitches!

350
00:25:50.244 --> 00:25:52.179
Tonight's your lucky night,
asshole.


351
00:25:52.312 --> 00:25:55.082
We're giving away
free etiquette lessons.


352
00:25:55.215 --> 00:25:56.617
Next time
you gotta pay up.


353
00:26:03.123 --> 00:26:05.259
You need a ride?

354
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.298
Well, I think
we deserve a shot.


355
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:59.146
Um, hey, do you think that what
just happened was, like, bad?


356
00:27:03.116 --> 00:27:05.719
- You guys are not gonna believe what fuckin' happened.
- What happened?


357
00:27:07.554 --> 00:27:10.557
I don't know. I'm like kinda shaken up.
It feels weird.


358
00:27:12.927 --> 00:27:17.297
I don't think that there's anything weird
about making men like that feel unsafe.


359
00:27:20.167 --> 00:27:22.102
What if the police
find out?


360
00:27:25.138 --> 00:27:26.573
You think he's gonna
go to the cops


361
00:27:26.707 --> 00:27:30.043
and tell them that he got
beat up by a bunch of girls?


362
00:27:31.044 --> 00:27:33.247
Come here.

363
00:27:36.083 --> 00:27:39.253
Listen, she doesn't belong
here and you know it, okay?


364
00:27:39.386 --> 00:27:42.656
So I think we should just
send her home and move on.


365
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:44.024
Dude, what is your problem?

366
00:27:44.157 --> 00:27:45.826
What?
Who is Tommy Collin?


367
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.997
He is this fucking ruthless fuckboy
we went to school together with.


368
00:27:49.129 --> 00:27:51.765
What's my problem?
She doesn't fucking belong here, dude.


369
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.268
Nobody fuckin' belongs here.
That's the whole fucking point.


370
00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:55.870
He just threw me
on the ground.


371
00:27:56.004 --> 00:27:58.071
I feel like we've all paid our dues.
We belong here...


372
00:27:58.205 --> 00:27:59.740
Paid our dues.
What does that even...


373
00:27:59.874 --> 00:28:01.876
He was much more graphic.
We went to school together.


374
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.311
Smacked him in the fucking
mouth with a bar flashlight.


375
00:28:04.444 --> 00:28:06.246
Knocked out four
of his fuckin' teeth.


376
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.284
And then, like,
it was denial and embarrassment,


377
00:28:10.417 --> 00:28:12.052
and anger, then disgust.

378
00:28:12.185 --> 00:28:14.388
Angie, we've been together
since foster care.


379
00:28:14.521 --> 00:28:17.057
You know, we travel around the
world, fuckin' shit up.


380
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.492
- Ain't takin' no names.
- Da-da-da-da.


381
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:20.227
What are you sayin' about me
over there, sis?


382
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.296
I'm sayin' that I got
the beauty and the brains.


383
00:28:22.429 --> 00:28:25.599
Oh, that's okay, but I got the fuckin'
right hook. Don't you forget it.


384
00:28:26.833 --> 00:28:29.136
Turn that shit up!

385
00:29:59.927 --> 00:30:02.030
Oh, I'm sorry.

386
00:30:02.162 --> 00:30:04.899
I didn't mean to scare you.

387
00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:10.504
Can I make you
some breakfast?


388
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.811
Well, Regina seems to have
taken quite a liking to you.


389
00:30:25.452 --> 00:30:27.854
She told me
about last night.


390
00:30:30.724 --> 00:30:32.192
You all right?

391
00:30:34.594 --> 00:30:36.864
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

392
00:30:38.565 --> 00:30:41.969
Did the violence upset you?

393
00:30:43.071 --> 00:30:45.305
I, well, freaked out
and froze.


394
00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:49.609
I wanted to help, but...

395
00:30:49.743 --> 00:30:52.546
Violence can be
paralyzingly intense.


396
00:30:52.679 --> 00:30:55.849
You were rightfully scared.

397
00:30:55.983 --> 00:30:57.684
I guess.

398
00:30:57.818 --> 00:31:01.655
But the girls weren't.
They just stepped right up.


399
00:31:01.788 --> 00:31:05.726
But you'd, uh,
call the cops next time?


400
00:31:06.393 --> 00:31:07.995
They aren't
gonna do nothin'.


401
00:31:08.129 --> 00:31:09.864
What'd you say?

402
00:31:12.532 --> 00:31:15.268
The cops aren't
gonna do anything.


403
00:31:21.742 --> 00:31:25.378
Well, I couldn't
agree with you more.


404
00:31:25.512 --> 00:31:28.515
The girls just knew
what to do.


405
00:31:28.648 --> 00:31:30.450
I wish
I could be like that.


406
00:31:34.155 --> 00:31:35.856
You can.

407
00:31:40.427 --> 00:31:41.661
Eat up.

408
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.271
Uh, thanks for the ride.

409
00:31:51.404 --> 00:31:53.273
Are y'all
hangin' out later?


410
00:31:53.406 --> 00:31:54.876
We leave tonight.

411
00:31:55.009 --> 00:31:56.643
Where are you going?

412
00:31:57.844 --> 00:31:59.346
It's not all weddings
and parties.


413
00:31:59.479 --> 00:32:01.448
We got work to do.

414
00:32:02.482 --> 00:32:04.351
What kind of work?

415
00:32:04.484 --> 00:32:07.754
Kind of like a
clean-up-the-streets program.


416
00:32:09.924 --> 00:32:12.526
Like last night,
but all over the state.


417
00:32:13.693 --> 00:32:14.861
Oh.

418
00:32:18.232 --> 00:32:19.800
You gotta ask a girl.

419
00:32:19.934 --> 00:32:22.236
I'm not gonna
make it easy on you.


420
00:32:22.369 --> 00:32:24.071
You think I could come?

421
00:32:24.205 --> 00:32:27.340
Yeah, I think you could.

422
00:32:27.474 --> 00:32:30.310
- I mean I don't wanna intrude.
- Shut up. You're not intruding.


423
00:32:30.443 --> 00:32:31.913
But just think about it.

424
00:32:32.046 --> 00:32:34.215
If you're not cool with
what happened last night,


425
00:32:34.381 --> 00:32:36.483
we can just hang
when I get back.


426
00:32:37.551 --> 00:32:39.287
Cool. Okay.

427
00:32:39.419 --> 00:32:40.654
Okay, bye.

428
00:32:40.787 --> 00:32:43.723
Oh, oh, oh. Just let me...

429
00:32:43.857 --> 00:32:47.460
- My seat belt. It was on.
- Yeah. Yeah, it was.


430
00:32:51.498 --> 00:32:53.567
You said you were attacked
by two Black males


431
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.769
who mugged you
and then smashed your car.


432
00:32:55.903 --> 00:32:57.571
That's exactly
what happened.


433
00:32:57.704 --> 00:32:59.639
You can't smoke in here.

434
00:33:02.809 --> 00:33:04.312
The thing is,
I don't see it.


435
00:33:04.444 --> 00:33:06.446
I see you pinnin' a girl
pretty good


436
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.649
and then gettin' your ass
handed to you, though.


437
00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:13.988
See, that... that...
that is irrelevant.


438
00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:16.324
Those bitches still
have to pay for my car.


439
00:33:16.456 --> 00:33:20.228
You know that intentionally misleading a
police officer is a felony, Mr. Miller.


440
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.462
Why don't we call it even?

441
00:33:28.535 --> 00:33:30.104
You will hear
from my father.


442
00:33:30.238 --> 00:33:31.638
Can't wait.

443
00:33:36.077 --> 00:33:37.044
<i>Hey, Grandma.</i>

444
00:33:37.178 --> 00:33:38.980
<i>Uh, I just wanted
to let you know</i>


445
00:33:39.113 --> 00:33:41.916
<i>I am goin' away
for the weekend.</i>


446
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:46.386
<i>Um, I'm goin' camping
with my new friends.</i>


447
00:33:55.997 --> 00:33:58.565
So we're just
taking anyone with us?


448
00:33:59.766 --> 00:34:01.969
Look, she doesn't know
the protocols, Regina.


449
00:34:02.103 --> 00:34:03.770
She's gonna get
somebody killed.


450
00:34:03.905 --> 00:34:06.874
<i>But I didn't want you to worry.</i>

451
00:34:07.741 --> 00:34:09.676
<i>I'm in good hands.</i>

452
00:34:10.144 --> 00:34:11.112
<i>I love you.</i>

453
00:34:11.245 --> 00:34:12.313
- You look great.
- Thanks.


454
00:34:12.445 --> 00:34:14.848
- Yeah, I'm glad you came.
- Me too.


455
00:34:14.982 --> 00:34:16.918
Yeah.

456
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:23.790
Hey.

457
00:34:25.558 --> 00:34:27.727
You seem like a smart girl.

458
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:31.899
This is not a holiday.

459
00:34:32.465 --> 00:34:33.935
- All right?
- Mm.


460
00:34:34.068 --> 00:34:37.604
So if you're gonna be here,
you're gonna contribute.


461
00:34:38.538 --> 00:34:41.541
You will be counted on.

462
00:34:42.243 --> 00:34:43.777
All right.

463
00:34:46.546 --> 00:34:48.648
Thanks, Sal.

464
00:34:50.885 --> 00:34:52.920
Ever since we were little kids,
I've always been better


465
00:34:53.054 --> 00:34:54.956
and I'm always
gonna be better.


466
00:34:55.089 --> 00:34:56.690
Okay, shit-talker.

467
00:35:10.503 --> 00:35:13.506
- Exactly. Get your ass, let's go.
- Yeah, whatever! Let's...


468
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.343
It's that time
of the year again.


469
00:35:15.475 --> 00:35:16.911
We're hittin' the road tonight.

470
00:35:17.044 --> 00:35:19.447
Now, the target
of our focus this year,


471
00:35:19.579 --> 00:35:22.849
MFM, Men's First Movement.

472
00:35:22.984 --> 00:35:25.353
Was your standard group
of passive fascists,


473
00:35:25.485 --> 00:35:27.654
but they have recently
become involved


474
00:35:27.787 --> 00:35:31.591
in a series of hate crimes
and various assaults.


475
00:35:31.725 --> 00:35:33.995
Now, the leader
is Mark Vanderhill.


476
00:35:34.128 --> 00:35:37.365
You wanna know what we think
about your sensitive politics


477
00:35:37.497 --> 00:35:39.233
and these issues, yeah?

478
00:35:39.934 --> 00:35:41.568
Fuckin' that's what we think!

479
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:44.405
Mark Vanderhill began
his illustrious career


480
00:35:44.537 --> 00:35:46.573
four years ago
as an online pickup artist


481
00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:48.376
under the name Arc Angel.

482
00:35:48.508 --> 00:35:49.709
And we're back, fellas.

483
00:35:49.843 --> 00:35:51.078
Back... Back... Back, fellas.

484
00:35:51.212 --> 00:35:53.847
Six months after his show
on DH1 was canceled,


485
00:35:53.981 --> 00:35:56.683
Mark unveils his new blog,
The Master's Burden,


486
00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.087
in which he has undergone
not just a physical makeover


487
00:36:00.221 --> 00:36:03.357
but a seemingly
ideological one as well.


488
00:36:03.491 --> 00:36:05.759
Consent politics.
I mean, fuck.


489
00:36:05.893 --> 00:36:08.062
Have we all become faggots
out here, fellas?


490
00:36:08.195 --> 00:36:11.731
'Cause here's what I know.
You see it, you want it, you take it.


491
00:36:11.866 --> 00:36:13.367
That's what the MFM
is really all about.


492
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:16.270
You know, you hear these
libtards talk about safe spaces.


493
00:36:16.404 --> 00:36:18.506
They don't really understand
what that means.


494
00:36:18.638 --> 00:36:19.974
This is a safe space.

495
00:36:22.842 --> 00:36:26.713
Mark became an alt-right icon
and formed MFM


496
00:36:26.846 --> 00:36:29.716
after a successful series
of lectures entitled


497
00:36:29.849 --> 00:36:31.851
"The Necessity of Dominance."

498
00:36:34.255 --> 00:36:36.190
That's the way we've done it
for thousands of years,


499
00:36:36.323 --> 00:36:38.192
and there's nothing wrong
with that.


500
00:36:38.325 --> 00:36:39.460
<i>That's natural.</i>

501
00:36:39.592 --> 00:36:40.961
<i>That's an expression
of dominance.</i>


502
00:36:41.095 --> 00:36:42.629
<i>Every species on the planet
does it.</i>


503
00:36:42.762 --> 00:36:46.566
The male exerts dominance
over the female.


504
00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:49.036
It's fucking science!

505
00:36:51.704 --> 00:36:52.873
The way you gotta work
with the gun.


506
00:36:53.007 --> 00:36:54.875
You do it quick
in a satisfying way.


507
00:36:55.009 --> 00:36:57.078
Same way I've always
talked about with women.


508
00:36:57.211 --> 00:36:58.778
Can't be too gentle
with them.


509
00:36:58.913 --> 00:37:00.747
You gotta make sure
they understand


510
00:37:00.881 --> 00:37:02.950
how you wanna use them.

511
00:37:03.084 --> 00:37:06.853
And of course,
we expect them to fight back


512
00:37:06.987 --> 00:37:08.788
because it wouldn't be any fun
if they didn't.


513
00:37:08.923 --> 00:37:10.757
That's your fuckin' head!

514
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:13.860
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.

515
00:37:15.162 --> 00:37:18.132
You've never even been outside
of this town before, have you?


516
00:37:18.265 --> 00:37:20.067
I mean, my aunt lives
in Philadelphia.


517
00:37:20.201 --> 00:37:22.236
Just stay the fuck
out of my way.


518
00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:26.340
Their increased militarization
has been cause for concern.


519
00:37:26.474 --> 00:37:29.076
The MFM has some of the
best shooters in the world.


520
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.145
<i>He has had notable association</i>

521
00:37:31.278 --> 00:37:32.712
<i>with mass shootings.</i>

522
00:37:32.846 --> 00:37:34.582
Whoa! Fuck, yeah!

523
00:37:34.714 --> 00:37:37.251
<i>He's also linked to the
bomber at the Ogden abortion clinic.</i>


524
00:37:37.384 --> 00:37:39.786
That's what we're fuckin' talking about.
You see that?


525
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.557
All investigations
have mysteriously ceased.


526
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:45.559
Perfect.

527
00:37:45.692 --> 00:37:48.828
Seems like he might be gettin'
a little help from the inside.


528
00:37:48.963 --> 00:37:52.533
The MFM is hosting a rally
in Littleson.


529
00:37:52.665 --> 00:37:56.337
Littleson is the hub
of human trafficking


530
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.339
<i>in this nation.</i>

531
00:37:58.472 --> 00:38:02.775
It is a town run by a deeply
corrupt police force,


532
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:06.313
the head of which
is Chief David Morill.


533
00:38:06.447 --> 00:38:08.748
Now, that would be him.

534
00:38:08.883 --> 00:38:11.285
Now, he's a very dangerous man.

535
00:38:24.731 --> 00:38:26.433
It's so goddamn dark out here.

536
00:38:26.567 --> 00:38:27.800
Hmm.

537
00:38:31.305 --> 00:38:32.339
Thanks.

538
00:38:34.508 --> 00:38:36.277
Wait, she can hear perfectly?

539
00:38:36.743 --> 00:38:37.677
Lily?

540
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.246
Yeah, totally.

541
00:38:41.148 --> 00:38:44.185
She won a singing competition
when she was younger,


542
00:38:44.318 --> 00:38:47.421
released a whole bunch of songs,
got semi-famous.


543
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:53.928
One guy in particular
kept sendin' her stuff.


544
00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:56.564
Eventually, he started asking
her a bunch of weird shit.


545
00:38:57.531 --> 00:39:01.235
So she rejected him,
and then six months later,


546
00:39:01.368 --> 00:39:03.904
<i>he showed up
to one of her shows,</i>


547
00:39:04.737 --> 00:39:06.340
<i>knocked her unconscious,</i>

548
00:39:06.473 --> 00:39:09.276
<i>sprayed lighter fluid
up her nose and down her throat</i>


549
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.312
<i>and set her on fire.</i>

550
00:39:12.913 --> 00:39:15.950
Holy fucking shit.

551
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.817
Yeah.

552
00:39:17.952 --> 00:39:19.687
In court, he said something
along the lines of,


553
00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:23.157
"If she's not gonna sing for me,
she's not gonna sing for anyone."


554
00:39:26.527 --> 00:39:30.464
I, uh... I won't tell her
that you told me that.


555
00:39:31.565 --> 00:39:34.368
I wouldn't have told you
if I didn't know it was okay.


556
00:39:37.638 --> 00:39:38.872
Right.

557
00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:54.355
And you? How did you, uh...

558
00:39:55.222 --> 00:39:57.258
How'd you
end up here?


559
00:40:00.127 --> 00:40:02.795
My stepfather
murdered my mother.


560
00:40:06.066 --> 00:40:07.834
And I couldn't forgive him.

561
00:40:31.492 --> 00:40:33.193
Marney.

562
00:40:33.327 --> 00:40:34.595
Here, sir.

563
00:40:34.728 --> 00:40:37.131
Bring the truck around.
Gotta go check something.


564
00:40:37.264 --> 00:40:39.832
Yeah.
Time to hit the streets.


565
00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:41.769
What? We're not hittin'
anything, okay?


566
00:40:41.902 --> 00:40:44.371
Just bring the truck around.

567
00:40:46.206 --> 00:40:47.975
- Just go get the truck.
- Right.


568
00:41:11.598 --> 00:41:12.866
Where are we?

569
00:41:57.378 --> 00:41:58.912
Put your gun down,
Marney.


570
00:41:59.046 --> 00:42:01.882
I'm in my legal right to put
down a pair of trespassers.


571
00:42:02.015 --> 00:42:03.517
We're not here for you,
Fala.


572
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.652
You got some balls
showin' up here.


573
00:42:11.959 --> 00:42:15.896
Fala, these MFM guys
are complete psychos.


574
00:42:16.029 --> 00:42:18.198
And they're in deep
with the police.


575
00:42:18.867 --> 00:42:21.034
Nice seeing you, Vernon.

576
00:42:34.047 --> 00:42:37.618
You know, a while back,
federal office suspected


577
00:42:37.751 --> 00:42:41.188
that cops in Littleson are
runnin' a human trafficking ring.


578
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:44.625
They sent an agent
undercover,


579
00:42:44.758 --> 00:42:47.394
and she was a tactically
trained field officer.


580
00:42:49.229 --> 00:42:51.031
She turned up
missin' a head.


581
00:42:51.165 --> 00:42:54.334
I ain't willin' to let that happen to
Sal, even if you are.


582
00:42:55.936 --> 00:42:57.504
All right?

583
00:43:21.028 --> 00:43:23.263
Oh, my God. Shit.

584
00:43:27.902 --> 00:43:30.103
Yo, don't say anything.

585
00:43:31.138 --> 00:43:32.673
Just stay calm.

586
00:43:37.678 --> 00:43:39.413
Let Beatrice do the talking.

587
00:43:39.546 --> 00:43:42.683
Black folks get killed talking
back to the police around here.


588
00:43:57.264 --> 00:43:58.999
How're we doin' today,
ladies?


589
00:43:59.132 --> 00:44:00.234
Good.

590
00:44:00.367 --> 00:44:02.202
What are you ladies
up to?


591
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.472
Just goin'
on a road trip.


592
00:44:06.073 --> 00:44:07.508
Oh, yeah? Where to?

593
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.649
I asked you
ladies a question.


594
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:20.187
I'm sorry, Officer,
but, um,


595
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.489
you haven't explained
why you stopped us.


596
00:44:22.623 --> 00:44:24.258
I mean, you didn't
just pull us over


597
00:44:24.391 --> 00:44:27.094
because you saw
two Black women driving?


598
00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:35.235
A lot of drugs
coming through here.


599
00:44:35.369 --> 00:44:36.703
You, uh, mind
if I call...


600
00:44:36.837 --> 00:44:39.172
State law says an officer
may not detain a motorist


601
00:44:39.306 --> 00:44:41.575
for a period of time longer
than reasonably necessary


602
00:44:41.708 --> 00:44:44.144
to complete the
investigation of a violation.


603
00:44:44.278 --> 00:44:45.914
But you may not detain us
while you wait


604
00:44:46.046 --> 00:44:47.614
for additional officers
to arrive.


605
00:45:01.495 --> 00:45:03.664
You ladies
watch your back now.


606
00:45:07.834 --> 00:45:09.037
Know your rights.

607
00:45:10.404 --> 00:45:12.806
Oh, my God,
that was incredible.


608
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.075
How did you know that?

609
00:45:15.208 --> 00:45:17.244
My grandfather was
a district court judge.


610
00:45:17.377 --> 00:45:19.680
Sounds like a smart man.

611
00:45:19.813 --> 00:45:21.916
He was a complete
and utter cocksucker.


612
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.419
I thank the stars every day
that cancer ate his brain


613
00:45:25.552 --> 00:45:28.155
and every pedophilic
thought in it.


614
00:45:39.166 --> 00:45:41.568
So, what are we doing?

615
00:45:44.738 --> 00:45:46.840
- Police work.
- Right.


616
00:45:46.975 --> 00:45:51.578
But we're out of Guthrie, so we don't
have any jurisdiction here, so...


617
00:45:51.712 --> 00:45:54.247
We're keepin' the people that
live in our jurisdiction safe,


618
00:45:54.381 --> 00:45:57.551
even if they go outside
of our jurisdiction.


619
00:45:57.684 --> 00:46:00.054
Even if they continually
make questionable decisions


620
00:46:00.187 --> 00:46:02.255
that put themselves
and others in danger.


621
00:46:04.725 --> 00:46:07.294
Okay, yeah.
That's... That's much clearer.


622
00:46:10.697 --> 00:46:11.732
Thanks.

<i>Tensions are high after
disciplinary hearings at NCU</i>


624
00:46:23.276 --> 00:46:26.047
led to a unanimous decision
of non-conviction


625
00:46:26.179 --> 00:46:27.547
by the disciplinary board.

626
00:46:31.451 --> 00:46:33.754
The case at hand
was based off of claims


627
00:46:33.888 --> 00:46:35.389
of sexual assault and rape

628
00:46:35.522 --> 00:46:39.459
<i>made against the NCU chapter
of the Pi Iota Gamma house.</i>


629
00:46:39.593 --> 00:46:42.663
The claim was made after
this photograph surfaced.


630
00:46:42.796 --> 00:46:45.365
<i>Members of the student body
were protesting</i>


631
00:46:45.499 --> 00:46:46.968
- <i>as soon as the decision came in.</i>
- We need to call Sal.


632
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:52.806
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!


633
00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.543
Clean it up! What the fuck you gawkin' at?
Clean it up!


634
00:46:57.444 --> 00:46:59.613
Today, justice was served.

635
00:46:59.746 --> 00:47:03.817
After three long months of
bullshit persecution and slander,


636
00:47:03.951 --> 00:47:06.620
those fuckin' admin faggots
finally learned a lesson


637
00:47:06.753 --> 00:47:09.523
that we have all known
for a long time!


638
00:47:09.656 --> 00:47:12.259
You can't stop Pi Gam!

639
00:47:13.193 --> 00:47:16.763
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!


640
00:47:16.898 --> 00:47:20.801
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!


641
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.176
We're 24 miles away
from that.


642
00:47:28.308 --> 00:47:29.609
You know anyone over there?

643
00:47:29.743 --> 00:47:31.311
Rudy lives
in the next town over.


644
00:47:31.445 --> 00:47:33.680
They're the ones
that sent the video to Lily.


645
00:47:33.814 --> 00:47:35.348
We're not just gonna
let this go, right?


646
00:47:35.482 --> 00:47:37.818
We can't be everywhere.
You know that.


647
00:47:37.952 --> 00:47:39.853
Come on, Beatrice.
You know that shit was fucked up.


648
00:47:39.987 --> 00:47:42.990
Look at what these boys
are doin' to girls out...


649
00:47:43.124 --> 00:47:45.592
<i>...complaints
of sexual assault and rape.</i>


650
00:47:51.665 --> 00:47:54.735
<i>...complaints
of sexual assault and rape.</i>


651
00:47:57.537 --> 00:47:59.207
All right, enough.

652
00:47:59.339 --> 00:48:02.609
We go, we talk to Rudy...

653
00:48:03.443 --> 00:48:04.946
And we help.

654
00:48:15.555 --> 00:48:17.992
I spoke to
three different girls.


655
00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:21.495
The photo in the news
was just the tip of the iceberg.


656
00:48:24.297 --> 00:48:27.367
Apparently, these guys
film everything.


657
00:48:29.736 --> 00:48:32.839
They have a room in the house
called "the vault."


658
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.076
It's reinforced

659
00:48:35.209 --> 00:48:37.945
and it has
its own security system.


660
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.982
This is it.

661
00:48:47.687 --> 00:48:50.624
Distract and retrieve.

662
00:48:51.658 --> 00:48:54.394
No, no, no. You would have
to find a way of bypassing


663
00:48:54.528 --> 00:48:56.230
the house's security system.

664
00:48:56.363 --> 00:48:57.631
Lily.

665
00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:03.503
All right, girls...

666
00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:08.176
we're gonna
have to move fast.


667
00:49:08.308 --> 00:49:09.476
Regina and I
will take lead.


668
00:49:09.609 --> 00:49:10.945
I think Joey
should roll with me.


669
00:49:11.078 --> 00:49:14.282
I mean, college kids.
She'd be perfect.


670
00:49:14.414 --> 00:49:17.350
Regina, she...
But she doesn't know...


671
00:49:17.484 --> 00:49:18.418
I was asking Sal.

672
00:49:18.552 --> 00:49:19.987
I can do it.

673
00:49:20.121 --> 00:49:21.588
- Okay.
- Hey, I wanna do it.


674
00:49:21.721 --> 00:49:22.924
Fine.

675
00:49:25.659 --> 00:49:27.494
Let's go pick out
some clothes.


676
00:49:41.075 --> 00:49:44.979
Beatrice tells me
you're going after MFM?


677
00:49:46.948 --> 00:49:50.784
Sal, those aren't
some frat boys.


678
00:49:52.485 --> 00:49:54.621
The cops, this whole town...

679
00:49:58.259 --> 00:50:01.795
Grayson says people go
missing there all the time.


680
00:50:04.664 --> 00:50:07.534
Sal, I'm always gonna
have your back,


681
00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:10.304
but you need to know

682
00:50:10.437 --> 00:50:12.439
this destruction,
the violence,


683
00:50:12.572 --> 00:50:14.208
you know it's gonna
come back to you.


684
00:50:14.342 --> 00:50:15.575
It always does.

685
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.519
You're just gonna
have to trust me.


686
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:38.966
<i>We need to get invited inside.</i>

687
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.500
- Hi!
- Hi!


688
00:50:40.634 --> 00:50:42.602
<i>They're frat boys,
so this shouldn't take much.</i>


689
00:50:42.736 --> 00:50:46.173
We were touring the campus and we heard
that this is the house to party at.


690
00:50:46.307 --> 00:50:49.442
So, we were just wondering if
you guys wanted to throw down.


691
00:50:52.179 --> 00:50:55.448
We got... We got all... We got the
other floors, got a bedroom and a bed.


692
00:50:55.582 --> 00:50:57.484
- Oh, wow!
- Um, you know.


693
00:50:59.619 --> 00:51:01.989
I did that.
I put the bras up there.


694
00:51:02.123 --> 00:51:04.824
- I love that chandelier.
- Yeah, it's, like, arty.


695
00:51:04.959 --> 00:51:08.595
I brought some of
my uncle's moonshine, you guys.


696
00:51:09.796 --> 00:51:12.532
To you all getting everything
that you deserve in life.


697
00:51:14.201 --> 00:51:15.602
- I'll take that!
- Yeah.


698
00:51:15.735 --> 00:51:17.104
- Take that!
- Cheers!


699
00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:22.910
I'm so fucked up. Oh, my God.

700
00:51:23.044 --> 00:51:24.378
I know!

701
00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:29.951
Um, can I use
your bathroom?


702
00:51:35.655 --> 00:51:39.093
What the fuck?
How do you, like, chug a beer?


703
00:51:50.338 --> 00:51:52.173
Back it.
Open the throat up.


704
00:51:52.306 --> 00:51:53.673
- Show me.
- Okay, open the throat.


705
00:51:53.807 --> 00:51:55.443
- You know all about that, right?
- I do.


706
00:51:55.575 --> 00:51:56.676
Like that?

707
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.112
Oh, my God,
he's gonna beat you.


708
00:51:58.245 --> 00:51:59.313
He's gonna beat you.

709
00:51:59.447 --> 00:52:00.747
Loser!

710
00:52:16.931 --> 00:52:18.366
Jett.

711
00:52:22.602 --> 00:52:25.772
Motherfucker.
Come on. Let's go.


712
00:52:53.334 --> 00:52:55.269
Sleep well.

713
00:52:58.705 --> 00:53:00.274
Damn, Bea. Warn a bitch!

714
00:53:02.675 --> 00:53:03.878
Where's Lily?

715
00:53:05.645 --> 00:53:06.914
Joey, n...

716
00:53:11.318 --> 00:53:12.552
Lily!

717
00:53:18.325 --> 00:53:20.560
I'm sorry about this.

718
00:53:22.796 --> 00:53:23.898
Lily! Okay.

719
00:53:32.806 --> 00:53:35.076
Go, go, go, go!

720
00:53:38.812 --> 00:53:40.613
Did you check the statewide
banner like I asked?


721
00:53:40.747 --> 00:53:43.084
Yeah. No sign of what
you told me to look for.


722
00:53:43.217 --> 00:53:44.218
Sure?

723
00:53:44.351 --> 00:53:47.154
Yeah, only three crimes
have been reported


724
00:53:47.288 --> 00:53:49.656
for female perpetrators
in the last two hours.


725
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:53.760
Uh, however, no signs
of "groups of women


726
00:53:53.894 --> 00:53:57.131
committing revenge crimes
in a big group."


727
00:53:58.899 --> 00:54:00.800
You wrote "group" twice.

728
00:54:03.104 --> 00:54:04.572
Which is fine.

729
00:54:04.704 --> 00:54:07.774
<i>Reports of
an explosion in 2236 Connor Drive.</i>


730
00:54:07.908 --> 00:54:10.810
<i>A group of women reportedly
fleeing the scene in a truck</i>


731
00:54:10.945 --> 00:54:12.113
<i>in a big group.</i>

732
00:54:12.246 --> 00:54:14.882
That's half a mile
from here.


733
00:54:17.118 --> 00:54:19.019
I haven't worn a dress
in a minute.


734
00:54:20.854 --> 00:54:23.756
- I kinda like it.
- Yeah?


735
00:54:23.891 --> 00:54:26.659
I mean, I've never had a reason to
wear something like this, but...


736
00:54:26.793 --> 00:54:28.963
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.


737
00:54:37.438 --> 00:54:38.939
Thank you.

738
00:54:51.986 --> 00:54:54.721
- <i>There was an explosion reported...</i>
- You see this shit?


739
00:54:54.854 --> 00:54:56.190
...at the Pi Iota house.

740
00:54:56.323 --> 00:54:58.392
Many students are claiming
that karma is responsible


741
00:54:58.526 --> 00:54:59.659
for the blaze.

742
00:54:59.792 --> 00:55:01.896
However, arson is believed
to be at play.


743
00:55:02.029 --> 00:55:03.663
So the question remains:

744
00:55:03.796 --> 00:55:06.433
What does the face of karma
actually look like?


745
00:55:06.567 --> 00:55:07.700
- Nice.
- Yeah.


746
00:55:07.834 --> 00:55:09.003
Hey, Sal.

747
00:55:09.136 --> 00:55:10.703
And let's not forget
that I almost lost


748
00:55:10.837 --> 00:55:12.873
a fucking hand
getting some of that intel.


749
00:55:13.007 --> 00:55:16.809
No, I know that, and you know I
don't give a fuck about the money.


750
00:55:23.884 --> 00:55:26.487
I just don't want you
to get hurt.


751
00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.022
That's it.

752
00:55:32.359 --> 00:55:33.394
Come here.

753
00:55:39.533 --> 00:55:41.368
Yeah, good work.

754
00:55:41.502 --> 00:55:44.837
But we need to keep goin'.
We need to get to Cuzzo's joint. Come on.


755
00:56:08.596 --> 00:56:11.298
Jesus fucking Christ!

756
00:56:21.841 --> 00:56:22.842
<i>Hello.</i>

757
00:56:22.977 --> 00:56:25.379
Hi, is this Mark Vanderhill?

758
00:56:26.647 --> 00:56:28.048
Who's this?

759
00:56:28.182 --> 00:56:30.217
This is
Sheriff Vernon Oakwood.


760
00:56:31.352 --> 00:56:32.953
Oh. Right, well,
that's not uncommon.


761
00:56:33.087 --> 00:56:35.788
Can I ask what you think
that has to do with me?


762
00:56:35.923 --> 00:56:38.825
Okay. Well, look,
I understand you know her,


763
00:56:38.959 --> 00:56:40.227
but you clearly don't know me!

764
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:42.263
'Cause if you knew
anything about me,


765
00:56:42.396 --> 00:56:44.831
you'd know that I don't cancel
events for activist fuck-rags.


766
00:56:44.965 --> 00:56:46.600
Let me explain
something to you.


767
00:56:46.734 --> 00:56:49.603
I can't cancel an event just
because a woman has it out for me.


768
00:56:49.737 --> 00:56:51.405
Okay?
Do you know who I am?


769
00:56:51.538 --> 00:56:54.375
Do you have any fuckin' idea how
many women have it out for me?


770
00:56:54.508 --> 00:56:56.776
<i>So, listen, tell your friend,
who you know so well,</i>


771
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:59.980
that if she wants to come and
learn the necessities of dominance,


772
00:57:00.114 --> 00:57:02.082
I'd be happy to teach her.

773
00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:04.351
Hello?

774
00:57:12.326 --> 00:57:13.360
Morill!

775
00:57:23.803 --> 00:57:25.639
That was
an out-of-town sheriff


776
00:57:25.773 --> 00:57:29.610
sayin' there's some feminists
who want to attack my event.


777
00:57:30.878 --> 00:57:35.015
I'd like you to be there.
I need additional protection.


778
00:57:35.149 --> 00:57:38.118
Not just
fuckin' Alistair.


779
00:57:49.963 --> 00:57:52.333
Phone call must have
really spooked you, huh?


780
00:57:52.466 --> 00:57:54.401
Do I need to remind you
that the whole reason


781
00:57:54.535 --> 00:57:56.603
why your operation
is even functional


782
00:57:56.737 --> 00:57:58.339
is because
I told the mayor...


783
00:57:58.472 --> 00:57:59.640
Officer Grumm,

784
00:57:59.773 --> 00:58:02.876
take that bitch to the boat
before she dies out here.


785
00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:04.078
Yes, Chief.

786
00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:05.479
Let the boys know
they can take off


787
00:58:05.612 --> 00:58:07.014
once you get her
on board.


788
00:58:07.147 --> 00:58:09.783
Then take this bitch
to his circle jerk.


789
00:58:09.917 --> 00:58:11.352
It's not a circle jerk,
all right?


790
00:58:11.485 --> 00:58:13.853
It's a very important
Men's First meeting.


791
00:58:13.987 --> 00:58:16.457
I expected more unity
from my brothers, okay?


792
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:17.624
Men First!

793
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.961
Redneck.

794
00:58:59.099 --> 00:59:00.200
I don't see him.

795
00:59:00.334 --> 00:59:02.403
Hold on. Hold on there.

796
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:24.224
What y'all doin' here?

797
00:59:24.358 --> 00:59:26.593
We're here to see Cuzzo.

798
01:00:06.567 --> 01:00:08.268
Well, well, well!

799
01:00:09.203 --> 01:00:11.004
The Mad Maxines
find themselves in need


800
01:00:11.138 --> 01:00:12.973
of a little help
from their friends.


801
01:00:13.106 --> 01:00:15.576
Well, you know,
we must really be in trouble


802
01:00:15.709 --> 01:00:18.512
if the only help we can get
is from the Little Rascals.


803
01:00:18.645 --> 01:00:21.181
Always talkin' shit.
How're you, Sal?


804
01:00:21.315 --> 01:00:22.649
Lily's hurt.

805
01:00:22.783 --> 01:00:25.219
Boys, show our guest where
the medical supplies are.


806
01:00:25.352 --> 01:00:27.054
Hi, I'm Joey.

807
01:00:27.187 --> 01:00:28.890
Anthony.
They call me "Cuzzo."


808
01:00:29.022 --> 01:00:30.190
- Cool.
- Nice to meet you.


809
01:00:30.324 --> 01:00:31.625
Nice to meet you.

810
01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:34.194
Um, do you all live here?

811
01:00:34.328 --> 01:00:35.729
About two years now.

812
01:00:35.863 --> 01:00:37.966
After the floods came,
this whole area was abandoned.


813
01:00:38.098 --> 01:00:39.533
We've been here
ever since.


814
01:00:40.234 --> 01:00:44.071
Uh, who takes care
of you guys?


815
01:00:45.372 --> 01:00:47.040
- What?
- Don't let age fool you.


816
01:00:47.174 --> 01:00:49.576
<i>These are capable,
smart boys.</i>


817
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.078
<i>We grow our own food.</i>

818
01:00:51.211 --> 01:00:53.547
<i>We make money
salvagin' materials and such.</i>


819
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.084
<i>I learned how to survive for
five years from Sal and Fala.</i>


820
01:00:57.217 --> 01:00:59.786
- Hmm.
- I gotta say I'm impressed.


821
01:00:59.921 --> 01:01:01.054
I am.

822
01:01:01.188 --> 01:01:02.789
It's a lot better
than a group home.


823
01:01:02.924 --> 01:01:04.591
Yeah, that's the idea.

824
01:01:04.725 --> 01:01:05.826
Yo, fellas!

825
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.029
Let's get the table ready
for dinner tonight.


826
01:01:09.162 --> 01:01:11.832
I came up with the queer
pop all-star squad.


827
01:01:11.966 --> 01:01:13.567
Oh, my God.
You're obsessed.


828
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.671
Ellen Ripley,
Sarah Connor, Clarice,


829
01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:21.408
all the Disney villains... Ursula, 
Jafar, all of them.

830
01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:24.778
Gandalf, Sherlock Holmes
and Harriet the Spy.


831
01:01:24.913 --> 01:01:27.949
Don't forget Curious George and the
little white children of Narnia.


832
01:01:28.081 --> 01:01:30.350
Oh, my God!

833
01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:31.920
Hey.

834
01:01:32.085 --> 01:01:34.087
Um, my friend thinks
you're pretty.


835
01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:36.690
Aw!

836
01:01:38.425 --> 01:01:40.861
You're gonna give those boys
a heart attack.


837
01:01:41.528 --> 01:01:43.330
Fellas, pull up!

838
01:01:43.463 --> 01:01:45.332
So may you
eat well tonight,


839
01:01:45.465 --> 01:01:49.770
and if you do ever need us,
we'll be there for you.


840
01:01:49.904 --> 01:01:51.371
Now let's eat!

841
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.612
He knows about Littleson.

842
01:03:05.746 --> 01:03:07.514
<i>He seems concerned,
even for him.</i>


843
01:03:07.648 --> 01:03:11.685
It's possible we may have
underestimated the situation.


844
01:03:18.358 --> 01:03:20.160
Vernon knows
where we're going.


845
01:03:20.293 --> 01:03:22.562
- Who's Vernon?
- He's a cop.


846
01:03:24.132 --> 01:03:25.766
Why are we going
to Littleson?


847
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.368
'Cause that's where
Sal's goin'.


848
01:03:28.936 --> 01:03:30.170
Who's Sal?

849
01:03:31.171 --> 01:03:32.907
Who's Sal?

850
01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:36.476
I'm gonna
tell you something,


851
01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:38.311
- but I don't wanna hear another word about it, okay?
- Yeah.


852
01:03:38.445 --> 01:03:41.883
I was graduatin'.
I was gettin' ready to go to the academy.


853
01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:47.587
She'd already graduated.
She was so fuckin' smart.


854
01:03:49.322 --> 01:03:51.692
And we had a thing.

855
01:03:51.825 --> 01:03:56.296
He was very charming,
and he was very handsome,


856
01:03:56.430 --> 01:04:00.333
and, shit,
I grew quite fond of him.


857
01:04:00.467 --> 01:04:02.636
<i>And so I asked her to marry me.</i>

858
01:04:03.503 --> 01:04:05.505
- Where?
- What?


859
01:04:06.506 --> 01:04:08.709
Where did you ask her
to marry you?


860
01:04:10.644 --> 01:04:13.246
On a Ferris wheel.

861
01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.315
That's romantic.

862
01:04:19.386 --> 01:04:21.421
I said yes, like an idiot.

863
01:04:21.555 --> 01:04:24.192
I had no fucking clue
what I wanted.


864
01:04:24.324 --> 01:04:25.859
You were in love.

865
01:04:26.727 --> 01:04:27.461
Yeah.

866
01:04:27.594 --> 01:04:30.430
Well... I got pregnant.

867
01:04:30.564 --> 01:04:33.300
He was thrilled.
I was not.


868
01:04:33.433 --> 01:04:35.802
We fought about it.

869
01:04:35.937 --> 01:04:38.772
I did what I had to do.

870
01:04:38.906 --> 01:04:44.678
He went and told my family,
who promptly disowned me.


871
01:04:45.445 --> 01:04:47.447
We never did get married.

872
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:49.917
I met Fala instead.

873
01:04:50.051 --> 01:04:52.019
- You still love her, don't you?
- Don't...


874
01:04:52.153 --> 01:04:54.688
- What?
- Don't. You're gonna give me advice.


875
01:04:54.821 --> 01:04:56.556
- Just don't.
- Sure. Sure. I get it.


876
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.625
Lockin' it up. It's...

877
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:03.730
- Just one thing, though. I...
- Nope, nope.


878
01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:08.635
I could say this doesn't
matter, but it does.


879
01:05:10.403 --> 01:05:13.640
Now, if any of you
wanna quit...


880
01:05:15.342 --> 01:05:17.444
now would be the time
to talk.


881
01:05:27.155 --> 01:05:28.655
All right.

882
01:05:55.582 --> 01:05:57.985
I hope my nana's okay.

883
01:06:20.041 --> 01:06:23.978
I am so excited
to see you all here tonight!


884
01:06:24.111 --> 01:06:25.545
Whoo!

885
01:06:25.679 --> 01:06:27.848
- Here's the man we've been waiting for.
- Yeah!


886
01:06:27.982 --> 01:06:32.119
Gentlemen and gentlemen,
Mr. Mark Vanderhill!


887
01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:40.360
Men first! Men first!
Men first! Men first!


888
01:06:40.493 --> 01:06:43.763
Men first! Men first!
Men first! Men first!


889
01:06:43.898 --> 01:06:47.734
Men first! Men first!
Men first! Men first!


890
01:06:47.869 --> 01:06:50.804
- Men first! Men first!
- Soldiers. Brothers.


891
01:06:51.671 --> 01:06:53.573
Okay, so not only
am I very excited to see


892
01:06:53.707 --> 01:06:55.775
all these familiar faces here,

893
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:59.479
but I'm also even more thrilled maybe to see
some of the new faces I see out here, right?


894
01:06:59.613 --> 01:07:01.414
Faces of people who...

895
01:07:01.548 --> 01:07:03.550
who wanted to be here,

896
01:07:03.683 --> 01:07:05.685
who wanted to be here,
but were afraid


897
01:07:05.819 --> 01:07:07.821
to make their faces known!

898
01:07:07.955 --> 01:07:10.790
I know about that fear.
That's what I wanna talk about today.


899
01:07:10.925 --> 01:07:13.060
A lot of you might know me
from the Vanderhill Files,


900
01:07:13.194 --> 01:07:15.029
if we've got any Fanderhills
in the building.


901
01:07:15.162 --> 01:07:18.465
When I was a young man, I was
actually a very sad, very lonely kid.


902
01:07:18.598 --> 01:07:21.102
I was rejected,
teased by my peers.


903
01:07:21.235 --> 01:07:23.971
I was ignored by women who...
You know what they do.


904
01:07:24.105 --> 01:07:27.741
They say they want one thing,
ultimately maybe they want another thing.


905
01:07:32.947 --> 01:07:35.049
I was rejected by a culture
that, as I've grown older,


906
01:07:35.182 --> 01:07:37.318
I've just watched it
become crazier and crazier


907
01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:40.054
and more and more emasculated.

908
01:07:40.187 --> 01:07:44.591
A culture in which every woman and
minority is a superstar by default.


909
01:07:45.393 --> 01:07:47.494
<i>Regardless
of their behavior.</i>


910
01:07:48.996 --> 01:07:50.998
No more insults, right?
No more slurs.


911
01:07:51.132 --> 01:07:54.734
That's what they say. But somehow,
these certain words are approached


912
01:07:54.869 --> 01:07:56.636
<i>with more and more anger,
right?</i>


913
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.206
No slurs, but we've got
these words now, like, uh,


914
01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.142
I don't know...

915
01:08:02.176 --> 01:08:03.277
Straight?

916
01:08:03.411 --> 01:08:04.744
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


917
01:08:05.779 --> 01:08:07.480
I don't know. White?

918
01:08:07.614 --> 01:08:09.616
Yeah.

919
01:08:10.217 --> 01:08:13.453
- <i>Man?</i>
- Yeah!


920
01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:16.924
<i>Dirty words.</i>

921
01:08:17.058 --> 01:08:20.061
Now, I don't know if y'all here
are men of religion or science.


922
01:08:20.194 --> 01:08:22.029
It doesn't matter.

923
01:08:22.163 --> 01:08:24.065
You and I, we know.

924
01:08:24.198 --> 01:08:26.200
We are men.

925
01:08:26.334 --> 01:08:28.069
We're men!

926
01:08:28.202 --> 01:08:29.870
We're men!

927
01:08:30.905 --> 01:08:33.740
I'm not gonna be
sorry for that anymore!


928
01:08:33.874 --> 01:08:36.543
I'm not gonna be sorry
for being white!


929
01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:39.546
I'm not gonna be sorry
for being straight!


930
01:08:39.679 --> 01:08:44.452
We brought this civilization
out of chaos.


931
01:08:44.584 --> 01:08:47.321
We founded this country
on our backs,


932
01:08:47.455 --> 01:08:49.457
and now, at the 11th hour,

933
01:08:49.589 --> 01:08:51.025
with the work already done,

934
01:08:51.158 --> 01:08:53.060
now they want a seat
at the table.


935
01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:56.730
Now they want us
to give up power willingly


936
01:08:56.863 --> 01:08:59.499
into the hands of people
who, I'm sorry,


937
01:08:59.632 --> 01:09:02.236
are incapable of wielding it.

938
01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:05.638
Well, brothers... brothers, let me say...

939
01:09:06.307 --> 01:09:09.243
Over my dead body.

940
01:09:10.777 --> 01:09:13.280
Over my dead body!

941
01:09:13.414 --> 01:09:17.184
Men first!
Men first! Men first! Men first!


942
01:09:17.318 --> 01:09:19.353
Men first!

943
01:09:19.487 --> 01:09:22.689
<i>Hey, y'all fellas. You may notice
the room may be gettin' a bit hazy.</i>


944
01:09:22.822 --> 01:09:23.991
<i>But don't worry
about your lungs.</i>


945
01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:26.027
<i>This stuff won't kill you.</i>

946
01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.628
<i>It isolates chromosomes in human
DNA that are meant for reproduction.</i>


947
01:09:28.762 --> 01:09:30.530
Bobby,
we got a little technical something.


948
01:09:30.663 --> 01:09:33.434
<i>Making it an effective sterilizing
agent for male primates.</i>


949
01:09:33.566 --> 01:09:37.204
<i>It shuts down cardio flow to your penis.</i>

950
01:09:37.338 --> 01:09:41.042
<i>Side effects may include
no more erections ever again.</i>


951
01:09:46.914 --> 01:09:48.548
What the fuck is that?

952
01:09:48.681 --> 01:09:50.617
Alistair, Alistair!
What the fuck is that?


953
01:09:53.686 --> 01:09:56.390
<i>So you don't have to
interact with women anymore.</i>


954
01:09:56.524 --> 01:09:57.892
<i>Yeah. No more crying.</i>

955
01:09:58.025 --> 01:10:00.394
- <i>No more makeup.</i>
- <i>No more periods.</i>


956
01:10:00.528 --> 01:10:01.795
<i>Ew!</i>

957
01:10:04.664 --> 01:10:07.767
<i>So, remember, boys, be nice.</i>

958
01:10:19.013 --> 01:10:22.083
Hey, be ready
to fly out of here.


959
01:10:22.216 --> 01:10:25.019
As soon as Bea shows,
we're gone.


960
01:10:30.057 --> 01:10:33.094
Yeah, baby!

961
01:10:34.361 --> 01:10:38.265
There's nothin' I love more
than watching grown men squeal.


962
01:10:38.399 --> 01:10:39.799
Watch out!

963
01:10:39.934 --> 01:10:42.103
Come on, Bea, come on!

964
01:10:42.236 --> 01:10:44.004
- I will fuck you, bitch!
- Come on, Bea!


965
01:10:44.138 --> 01:10:46.373
- I will fuck you!
- We gotta go!


966
01:10:52.513 --> 01:10:55.216
You know, sometimes you gotta
stop and smell the flowers.


967
01:10:56.917 --> 01:10:58.919
Come on, Bea.

968
01:11:04.325 --> 01:11:05.625
Are you crazy?

969
01:11:06.626 --> 01:11:08.395
You just sterilized
a room full of men!


970
01:11:08.529 --> 01:11:10.630
What more do you want?

971
01:11:11.365 --> 01:11:13.167
I'm talking to you!

972
01:11:15.536 --> 01:11:17.271
Fuck!

973
01:11:23.676 --> 01:11:26.013
We don't have time for this!

974
01:11:28.582 --> 01:11:29.984
Come on! Come on!

975
01:11:30.117 --> 01:11:33.087
Bea, get in the fucking truck!
Get in the car! Joey, go!


976
01:11:44.632 --> 01:11:47.101
Are you out of your mind?

977
01:11:47.234 --> 01:11:50.237
- What is wrong with you?
- We're on the same team. Just drop it!


978
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:52.907
- No!
- Bea, you were makin' a play that you didn't tell anyone about.


979
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.476
Oh, of course, you rush to
defend your new friend, Regina.


980
01:11:55.609 --> 01:11:57.710
- Oh, God!
- Don't worry about how many times I saved


981
01:11:57.844 --> 01:11:59.380
- your fucking life or anything.
- Shut up!


982
01:11:59.513 --> 01:12:01.781
- You are such a hypocrite!
- You are out of your league, bitch!


983
01:12:01.916 --> 01:12:03.951
- Everything I have is because of me.
- So what?


984
01:12:04.084 --> 01:12:07.354
- You... You were just gonna... You were gonna rape that man?
- It's accountability, okay?


985
01:12:07.488 --> 01:12:10.124
And no one's gonna give it to
us, so we have to take it.


986
01:12:10.257 --> 01:12:12.725
- Even if that means playing dirty sometimes.
- It is not the same thing.


987
01:12:12.859 --> 01:12:15.762
I can tell it's hard for you to
wrap your head around the fact


988
01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.164
that we can't always
talk shit out.


989
01:12:17.298 --> 01:12:19.867
So sometimes you just
gotta fuck somebody up.


990
01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.102
Yo, bro, chill!

991
01:12:22.236 --> 01:12:24.771
Hey, fuck. Shit.

992
01:12:26.207 --> 01:12:27.241
Joey!

993
01:12:27.608 --> 01:12:28.576
Ah, fuck.

994
01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:30.110
Hey.

995
01:12:34.847 --> 01:12:38.452
We're exposed out here.
We need to get to Cuzzo's. Come on.


996
01:12:39.887 --> 01:12:41.922
What are we doing?

997
01:12:42.789 --> 01:12:44.925
We're doin' what
no one else will.


998
01:12:45.059 --> 01:12:48.495
And, yo, you're not wrong about Beatrice.
She does fucked-up shit.


999
01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:51.298
But she comes
from fucked-up shit.


1000
01:12:51.432 --> 01:12:53.100
And I'm glad that
you called her out.


1001
01:12:53.234 --> 01:12:56.270
I'm sick of fuckin'
doin' it myself.


1002
01:13:14.989 --> 01:13:16.823
Ow! Watch it.

1003
01:13:18.791 --> 01:13:20.793
No. I told you.

1004
01:13:20.928 --> 01:13:23.863
It was four Black ones
and, like, an Arab.


1005
01:13:23.998 --> 01:13:27.001
I'm sorry. I'm not sure
I know who you are.


1006
01:13:27.134 --> 01:13:29.802
Vernon Oakwood.
I'm the sheriff of Guthrie.


1007
01:13:29.937 --> 01:13:32.473
Guthrie? You're quite
a ways from home.


1008
01:13:32.606 --> 01:13:35.576
- Just followin' up on a couple of things.
- You're the guy who called me.


1009
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:37.311
The one who told me
to cancel.


1010
01:13:37.444 --> 01:13:41.382
I heard about that. You seemed
concerned about some vigilantism?


1011
01:13:41.515 --> 01:13:44.784
That's right, I was,
but I don't know.


1012
01:13:45.852 --> 01:13:48.289
You made that call,
and now you're here,


1013
01:13:48.422 --> 01:13:51.158
a moment after
a terrorist attack.


1014
01:13:51.292 --> 01:13:54.161
Why don't you tell us
what you do know?


1015
01:13:55.663 --> 01:13:58.132
- Just followin' a hunch.
- What's her name?


1016
01:13:58.265 --> 01:14:00.768
Doesn't really seem
like her MO.


1017
01:14:00.901 --> 01:14:03.003
People change.

1018
01:14:04.638 --> 01:14:07.807
- Well...
- Don't you worry.


1019
01:14:07.941 --> 01:14:10.277
We take care of our
loose ends around here.


1020
01:14:10.411 --> 01:14:12.212
If she had somethin'
to do with this,


1021
01:14:12.346 --> 01:14:15.582
she's gonna be in a body bag
before sundown.


1022
01:14:17.985 --> 01:14:20.788
I was tracking them through
the surveillance cams.


1023
01:14:20.921 --> 01:14:22.256
Fifty miles from here.

1024
01:14:22.389 --> 01:14:24.425
One cam,
five miles down the road.


1025
01:14:25.492 --> 01:14:28.796
He's fuckin' full of shit.
I want you to arrest him.


1026
01:14:28.929 --> 01:14:30.397
I want you
to arrest him right now.


1027
01:14:30.531 --> 01:14:32.466
Listen, I know you got
some big-shot pride,


1028
01:14:32.599 --> 01:14:36.437
but you raise your voice to me
again, I'll kill you where you stand.


1029
01:14:39.273 --> 01:14:42.443
Get me some traffic footage
from every direction.


1030
01:14:42.576 --> 01:14:44.144
Yes, Chief.

1031
01:15:07.334 --> 01:15:10.404
Been a long couple
of days, huh?


1032
01:15:11.905 --> 01:15:14.274
I'm ready to go home.

1033
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:18.545
You don't
have to explain.


1034
01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:27.921
When I first met Regina,
she was only 12 years old.


1035
01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:32.359
She'd already
killed a man.


1036
01:15:34.628 --> 01:15:36.330
At this point,

1037
01:15:36.463 --> 01:15:38.499
Regina is so used
to this life,


1038
01:15:38.632 --> 01:15:42.336
she doesn't even consider if
this is what she wants anymore.


1039
01:15:43.504 --> 01:15:47.941
Asking yourself
what you want,


1040
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:50.744
listening to that

1041
01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:54.415
and doin'
what is right for you.


1042
01:15:57.317 --> 01:15:59.386
It's what
makes you strong.


1043
01:16:03.757 --> 01:16:06.326
We all understand
betrayal.


1044
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.830
For some of us,
it was a system.


1045
01:16:09.963 --> 01:16:12.032
Maybe it was
our families.


1046
01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:14.535
Could have been
a stranger.


1047
01:16:17.104 --> 01:16:19.673
Maybe it was
an old friend.


1048
01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:25.379
We all know
why we're here.


1049
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:45.432
Did I tell you
or didn't I tell you?


1050
01:16:46.366 --> 01:16:48.402
Yeah,
right here somewhere.


1051
01:16:55.442 --> 01:16:58.078
Whoo-hoo! Black attack!
Come on, let's go!


1052
01:16:58.212 --> 01:16:59.680
Boys, move.
Come on, come on.


1053
01:16:59.813 --> 01:17:01.715
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- Come on. Come on.


1054
01:17:01.849 --> 01:17:04.953
Boys, move! It's time to move!
Let's go! Come on!


1055
01:17:05.085 --> 01:17:06.753
Boys, get everythin' together!

1056
01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:09.256
Okay, now listen.

1057
01:17:09.389 --> 01:17:11.024
You stay with the girls
and you get home.


1058
01:17:11.158 --> 01:17:12.292
- All right?
- Yeah.


1059
01:17:12.426 --> 01:17:14.361
- You got it?
- All right, all right.


1060
01:17:14.495 --> 01:17:17.498
Come on, come on, come on. Get the bags.
Take this one. Petey, you got your backpack?


1061
01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:20.434
- Move to the front. Come on!
- Get these boys right out of here.


1062
01:17:20.567 --> 01:17:21.668
No matter what.

1063
01:17:39.152 --> 01:17:40.721
What are you doin' here?

1064
01:17:42.122 --> 01:17:44.591
You still look good.

1065
01:17:47.394 --> 01:17:49.730
- You look like hell.
- Yeah.


1066
01:17:49.863 --> 01:17:53.300
I'm in better shape
than you are, though.


1067
01:17:53.433 --> 01:17:56.069
Deranged lunatic Morill's
tryin' to find you.


1068
01:17:56.203 --> 01:17:58.372
You came a long way
for a heads-up.


1069
01:17:59.606 --> 01:18:02.142
You really think that they're
gonna let you walk away from this?


1070
01:18:02.276 --> 01:18:05.412
These guys are
professional murderers, Sal.


1071
01:18:05.546 --> 01:18:07.882
They're comin'
for your blood.


1072
01:18:08.649 --> 01:18:10.817
All right,
let me take you in.


1073
01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:15.756
I'll get you to a... get you a cell,
get you safe. It's better than a morgue.


1074
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:20.727
My knight in shinin' armor
comin' to save my neck


1075
01:18:20.861 --> 01:18:22.596
by choppin' off my head.

1076
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:24.831
You can hate me all you want,
all right, just...


1077
01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.667
Oh, I never hated you,
dummy.


1078
01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.136
I just wanted you to
ask me how to help


1079
01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:31.605
instead of telling me
how you're gonna do it.


1080
01:18:38.412 --> 01:18:40.380
You really
haven't changed a bit.


1081
01:18:40.514 --> 01:18:42.716
- I can control the situation. Just trust me.
- Hey!


1082
01:18:44.117 --> 01:18:47.321
It's over.

1083
01:18:50.591 --> 01:18:51.993
They're coming!

1084
01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:53.560
How can I help you?

1085
01:18:56.163 --> 01:18:58.198
You still shoot
that pistol?


1086
01:18:59.533 --> 01:19:03.370
Get down on the ground,
or we will kill you!


1087
01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:32.325
Hey, I'm sorry.

1088
01:20:35.262 --> 01:20:37.798
I'm sorry. I know
what she meant to you.


1089
01:20:37.932 --> 01:20:38.966
Yeah.

1090
01:20:41.368 --> 01:20:44.972
You know, I do what I
wanna do no matter what.


1091
01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:48.508
And... it's not always cool.

1092
01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:52.212
I was completely
out of line back there,


1093
01:20:52.345 --> 01:20:54.581
and you were right
to have stopped me.


1094
01:21:10.898 --> 01:21:12.532
What are you gonna do?

1095
01:21:14.301 --> 01:21:16.403
Take the boys
to the Bomb.


1096
01:21:17.237 --> 01:21:19.107
Talk to Fala.

1097
01:21:19.239 --> 01:21:21.475
Figure out
what the next step is.


1098
01:21:23.276 --> 01:21:24.478
Yeah, we'll lead the way.

1099
01:21:24.611 --> 01:21:26.047
No, no,
we can't go back there.


1100
01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.015
Beatrice, we don't have time
for this, okay?


1101
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:30.952
- We don't have time for this? What do you...
- Beatrice is right.


1102
01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.823
Regina, the man that killed
Sal, we gotta take him down.


1103
01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:03.050
War is upon us.

1104
01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:07.021
Today will go down in history
as the beginning of the end


1105
01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:10.958
for those who seek to destroy what
we have worked so hard to build,


1106
01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:14.528
these important and critical
structures of power.


1107
01:22:14.661 --> 01:22:18.565
Now, I'm on my way to convene with
some of my most trusted brothers


1108
01:22:18.698 --> 01:22:21.735
on our best course of action
going forward.


1109
01:22:21.869 --> 01:22:25.705
To my followers,
to my soldiers, know this.


1110
01:22:25.839 --> 01:22:30.610
Victory in this war
will be both bloody and sweet.


1111
01:22:31.979 --> 01:22:35.649
Know that I am personally
coming for you.


1112
01:22:37.051 --> 01:22:38.552
Fuck! Fuck!

1113
01:22:38.685 --> 01:22:41.621
How the fuck
did we let this happen?


1114
01:22:41.755 --> 01:22:43.824
After the chemical weapon
was released,


1115
01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:46.660
we tracked the suspects
to a nearby junkyard


1116
01:22:46.793 --> 01:22:49.496
with our fellow officers
from Guthrie,


1117
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:51.798
who, I am sad to say,

1118
01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:56.469
have both been shot and killed
by these maniacs.


1119
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:59.506
We were, however,
successful in taking down


1120
01:22:59.639 --> 01:23:01.008
the terrorist cell.

1121
01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:04.344
All the women responsible
for the attack in Littleson


1122
01:23:04.477 --> 01:23:06.379
have been killed.

1123
01:23:06.513 --> 01:23:08.448
That's all
I can share for now.


1124
01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:12.419
I bet you my boots
they're gonna try to find me.


1125
01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:15.789
So get out to the boat,
make sure everything's still on schedule.


1126
01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:55.655
I think you're gonna find
this was a big mistake.


1127
01:25:05.632 --> 01:25:07.068
I'll be there in an hour.

1128
01:25:07.201 --> 01:25:11.504
I got two more to load up
before the boat heads out.


1129
01:25:15.042 --> 01:25:19.413
You should have stuck
to frat boys and catcallers.


1130
01:25:19.546 --> 01:25:21.815
What are you
gonna do to us?


1131
01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.952
Kill you?

1132
01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:26.120
Nah.

1133
01:25:26.253 --> 01:25:29.390
Ten grand a head,
you're worth more alive.


1134
01:25:29.522 --> 01:25:33.793
Might have some fun with you
before I send you packin'.


1135
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:37.831
Really, you're just
a fucking hired gun.


1136
01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:45.373
Power is defined
by the storyteller.


1137
01:25:45.505 --> 01:25:49.477
If my boat full of women makes
it from San Marco to Mexico,


1138
01:25:49.609 --> 01:25:51.745
I'll be rich.

1139
01:25:51.879 --> 01:25:54.714
That boat gets intercepted,

1140
01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:57.284
I'll be the hero.

1141
01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.652
Call me whatever you like.

1142
01:25:59.786 --> 01:26:02.655
Nobody cares
what some Black cunt said.


1143
01:26:02.789 --> 01:26:04.225
They care what I say.

1144
01:26:04.358 --> 01:26:08.229
You see, I can turn
a missing mother of four


1145
01:26:08.362 --> 01:26:12.433
into a dangerous prostitute
who's abandoned her children.


1146
01:26:12.565 --> 01:26:15.835
I can turn the heroin
that I bought


1147
01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:19.106
into the reason why
we shoot up a car full of spics.


1148
01:26:22.943 --> 01:26:25.179
I'm the storyteller!

1149
01:26:27.214 --> 01:26:30.583
I can make you moan
like the whore you are.


1150
01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:37.191
What do you say, Joey?

1151
01:26:37.324 --> 01:26:39.994
Enough
for a conviction?


1152
01:26:41.028 --> 01:26:42.229
Yeah.

1153
01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:44.597
Say cheese,
motherfucker.


1154
01:26:45.632 --> 01:26:47.801
- Get off me!
- Hey!


1155
01:26:47.935 --> 01:26:49.303
Like you said,
they won't believe us,


1156
01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:51.906
but there's no way
they won't believe you.


1157
01:27:14.228 --> 01:27:17.164
Fala said the
video's going crazy on the Net.


1158
01:27:19.666 --> 01:27:21.768
Yo, look at all this shit.
What the fuck?


1159
01:27:21.902 --> 01:27:24.939
These are ID's
of 20 different missing women.


1160
01:27:25.072 --> 01:27:27.074
I like to keep trophies.

1161
01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.310
Gettin' your dick wet
is one thing,


1162
01:27:29.443 --> 01:27:33.080
but takin' something from someone
that they don't wanna give you,


1163
01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:35.849
well,
that's really special.


1164
01:27:35.983 --> 01:27:37.985
- What the fuck?
- Joey, don't.


1165
01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:40.287
Someone took it from you,
didn't they?


1166
01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:43.457
I saw that same fear
in your friend's eyes.


1167
01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:46.594
She looked scared
when she died.


1168
01:28:31.605 --> 01:28:33.140
Let's give you
a fair shot.


1169
01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:46.786
You ain't got it no
more, old man.


1170
01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:49.056
Take him down.

1171
01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:24.258
We should go.

1172
01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.262
Not me.

1173
01:29:54.888 --> 01:29:56.090
What?

1174
01:29:58.192 --> 01:30:00.227
Come on.
You have to come with us.


1175
01:30:00.694 --> 01:30:01.629
Come on.

1176
01:30:01.761 --> 01:30:03.397
- I can't.
- No, you...


1177
01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:06.333
No, I can't.

1178
01:31:58.212 --> 01:31:59.747
Baby!

1179
01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.882
I didn't even know
you were here!


1180
01:32:02.015 --> 01:32:04.084
Mmm. Mmm.

1181
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.790
Oh. Baby, what's wrong?

1182
01:32:09.923 --> 01:32:11.125
Nothin'.

1183
01:32:11.258 --> 01:32:12.926
It's just good
to see you.


1184
01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.361
How you feelin'?

1185
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.364
Better.

1186
01:32:24.571 --> 01:32:26.673
- Pop.
- Hey.


1187
01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:28.909
Hey, you know somethin'?

1188
01:32:29.042 --> 01:32:31.412
I walked two miles every day
while you were gone.


1189
01:32:31.545 --> 01:32:33.547
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. Two.


1190
01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:35.983
I got some
of this brown sugar butter.


1191
01:32:36.116 --> 01:32:37.284
You're gonna love it.

1192
01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:39.019
After breakfast,
we can walk to the store.


1193
01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:42.122
You won't believe how they've
changed some of the stuff.


1194
01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:44.258
Oh, and some of the people...

1195
01:33:31.972 --> 01:33:33.207
Joey.

1196
01:33:34.374 --> 01:33:36.743
- Can I come in?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.


1197
01:33:39.446 --> 01:33:42.216
Uh, can I get you
somethin' to drink?


1198
01:33:46.086 --> 01:33:49.656
It's good to see you, Joey.
I've been, uh... I've been meaning to...


1199
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:51.525
to call you.

1200
01:33:57.764 --> 01:34:00.969
What'd you wanna
talk to me about?


1201
01:34:01.101 --> 01:34:03.637
Nothing. I just wanted
to let you know


1202
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:06.840
that I was gonna be pretty busy
the next few weeks.


1203
01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:08.542
It's gonna be hard
to hang out.


1204
01:34:08.675 --> 01:34:11.778
Oh, you thought I wanted
to hang with you again?


1205
01:34:11.913 --> 01:34:13.547
No, I was not assuming that.

1206
01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.482
I just... I just wanted
to... to touch base.


1207
01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:18.552
Oh, relax.
That's not why I'm here.


1208
01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:21.388
All right. Um...

1209
01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:25.125
What's...

1210
01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:27.094
What's goin' on?

1211
01:34:29.931 --> 01:34:32.867
I've just been thinking
about the last time we hung out.


1212
01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:38.138
You know, the details,
they're, uh, a little foggy.


1213
01:34:40.173 --> 01:34:42.809
Yeah? Uh, which part?

1214
01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:49.816
Well, I remember
getting to the party.


1215
01:34:52.486 --> 01:34:56.323
I remember hanging out
and laughing.


1216
01:34:59.159 --> 01:35:02.629
I remember you were
being so sweet and...


1217
01:35:04.097 --> 01:35:06.833
...encouraging.

1218
01:35:06.968 --> 01:35:09.503
- And then, I don't know, that's when...
- You know what, Joey?


1219
01:35:09.636 --> 01:35:13.740
I have a phone call
for a big interview


1220
01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:15.309
that I really wanna get.

1221
01:35:15.442 --> 01:35:17.811
It's in,
like, five minutes.


1222
01:35:17.946 --> 01:35:20.247
Mike.

1223
01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:25.752
Would you like me to leave?

1224
01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:32.859
What if I said no?

1225
01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:42.636
What would you do
if I said no?


1226
01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:58.785
Oh, come on, you did it.
You can say it.


1227
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.824
I raped you.

1228
01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:12.833
You raped me.

1229
01:36:18.772 --> 01:36:21.742
<i>Did you think
if you never admitted it</i>


1230
01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:24.444
<i>that it never happened?</i>

1231
01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:26.313
<i>That if you left it
out of your story,</i>


1232
01:36:26.446 --> 01:36:28.382
<i>it would be erased from mine?</i>

1233
01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:32.319
<i>Silencin' the truth
doesn't mean it isn't there.</i>


1234
01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:35.489
<i>Doesn't mean it goes away.</i>

1235
01:36:36.823 --> 01:36:40.293
<i>And it doesn't let you
off the hook for what you did.</i>


1236
01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:43.463
<i>You raped me, Mike.</i>

1237
01:36:47.869 --> 01:36:50.504
<i>But you don't get
to tell my story.</i>


1238
01:36:54.075 --> 01:36:55.475
<i>I do.</i>

1239
01:36:56.643 --> 01:36:59.312
<i>So I'm gonna tell it right.</i>

1240
01:37:18.231 --> 01:37:19.967
And don't forget.

1241
01:37:21.301 --> 01:37:23.336
I will be watching.

1242
01:37:26.306 --> 01:37:28.408
So be good now.

1243
01:38:29.871 --> 01:38:31.605
- Speaking of the news...
- Yes. Oh, my God, those girls in the...


1244
01:38:31.738 --> 01:38:33.507
I've been following this on
the news since the beginning.


1245
01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.308
I'm just gonna
start talking,


1246
01:38:35.442 --> 01:38:38.045
'cause I don't really
know where to start.


1247
01:38:38.179 --> 01:38:41.249
What those ladies did
was absolutely acceptable.


1248
01:38:41.381 --> 01:38:44.451
Honestly, I don't feel bad for
a second for what happened.


1249
01:38:44.584 --> 01:38:50.357
We live experiencing violence
all the fucking time.


1250
01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:52.425
And nobody cares.

1251
01:38:59.699 --> 01:39:03.070
And I'm so glad that these girls are
finally doing something about it.


1252
01:39:03.204 --> 01:39:04.704
As a survivor
of sexual assault,


1253
01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:07.175
I've been told my whole life
that I can't be angry.


1254
01:39:07.307 --> 01:39:09.010
You're gonna sit back
and take it?


1255
01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:10.310
There's
no accountability.


1256
01:39:10.443 --> 01:39:11.946
The system has yet
to protect me.


1257
01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:14.648
The system has yet to do anything
about what happened to me.


1258
01:39:14.781 --> 01:39:16.184
Those girls in that town,
they were like...


1259
01:39:16.316 --> 01:39:17.450
They finally
did something about it.


1260
01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:23.523
Taking the law
into their own hands.


1261
01:39:24.892 --> 01:39:26.660
Gives me permission
to feel everything


1262
01:39:26.793 --> 01:39:29.163
that up until now I've
been told I shouldn't feel.


1263
01:39:29.297 --> 01:39:30.597
So they destroyed
a little property.


1264
01:39:30.730 --> 01:39:32.499
Wait, but where do I sign up
to join the girl game?


1265
01:39:32.632 --> 01:39:34.001
Women are standing up
for themselves.


1266
01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:36.469
- Is that worse than what the boys were doing?
- Nope.


1267
01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:39.606
Passive resistance
is no longer an option.


1268
01:39:39.739 --> 01:39:41.641
And the death of that
sheriff means that things


1269
01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:42.910
are actually
gonna change.


1270
01:39:43.044 --> 01:39:45.579
- We have had enough.
- Yeah, we had enough.


1271
01:39:45.712 --> 01:39:49.116
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- Fuck men, yeah!


1272
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:51.651
I'm just fuckin' thrilled that
there's a whole new generation


1273
01:39:51.785 --> 01:39:52.954
of badass women
out there.


1274
01:39:53.087 --> 01:39:54.654
Those fuckers got
what they deserved.


1275
01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:57.824
This time,
you're paying the price.


1276
01:39:57.959 --> 01:40:00.493
It's inspiring that people
are standing up finally.


1277
01:40:00.627 --> 01:40:03.064
- Yeah.
- Hopefully it will lead to some sort of change.


1278
01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:05.765
Those cocksuckers
deserved it.


1279
01:40:18.129 --> 01:40:23.129
