Johnny will be in school,

a teacher will flag it.

good at keeping cold things cold

It's make your own muffin day.

1129

all the grown-ups learned

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:25.524
how to make
yummy oatmeal muffins.

It's the letter H.

1152

All these letters,
they all make sounds.


1153

And those sounds together,
they can make words.

JANE: Okay.

01:45:52.043 --> 01:45:53.515
I can tell by the way
you're looking at me


1946
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:55.847
that you must think
I'm a monster.


1947
01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:57.750
I just wanted
to quickly check in,


1948
01:45:57.785 --> 01:45:59.488
make sure we're
on the same page.


1949
01:45:59.523 --> 01:46:02.018
MS. HINA: Thank you
for checking in.


1950
01:46:02.053 --> 01:46:05.989
I need to go and pick up
my daughter from school now.


1951
01:46:06.024 --> 01:46:07.859
JANE: Absolutely.

1952
01:46:07.894 --> 01:46:10.532
Hina, I'm going to tell you
something my manager told me


1953
01:46:10.567 --> 01:46:12.457
when I was fresh
out of my Master's.


1954
01:46:12.492 --> 01:46:14.767
Now, it hurt then to hear,

1955
01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:16.934
but I needed to hear it.

1956
01:46:16.969 --> 01:46:19.838
Community members
are always in need.


1957
01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:22.467
And it can be hard to
draw the line with them.


1958
01:46:22.502 --> 01:46:25.272
But for the sake
of your own self-care,


1959
01:46:25.307 --> 01:46:29.716
you need to keep personal
lives out of the picture.


1960
01:46:29.751 --> 01:46:33.819
Now, our focus here is family
literacy, not social work.


1961
01:46:33.854 --> 01:46:35.887
Now, I know there
are grey areas,


1962
01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:39.528
and I appreciate the love
that you put into the centre.


1963
01:46:39.563 --> 01:46:41.728
But if we don't draw a line,

1964
01:46:41.763 --> 01:46:44.390
our hearts can be hurt
a million times over.


1965
01:46:44.425 --> 01:46:46.733
Now, if you need
some skills building


1966
01:46:46.768 --> 01:46:51.804
or whatever to support you,
we can chat any time.


1967
01:46:51.839 --> 01:46:54.466
MS. HINA: Wow.
Any time?


1968
01:46:54.501 --> 01:46:56.072

instead of me
going to the funeral,


1975
01:47:05.754 --> 01:47:08.722
you want to strategize with me?

1976
01:47:08.757 --> 01:47:12.352
This is what you
came here to tell me?


1977
01:47:12.387 --> 01:47:15.322
JANE: Hina, I know this has been
a very, very sad time.


1978
01:47:15.357 --> 01:47:16.928
MS. HINA: Yes, it's been
a very difficult time.


1979
01:47:16.963 --> 01:47:18.765
There's a child that died
in a house fire, Jane.


1980

JANE: I
-I know.

1981
01:47:20.098 --> 01:47:21.603
MS. HINA: There are people
in our community that have


1982
01:47:21.638 --> 01:47:24.870
brushed shoulders
with her family once, twice,


1983
01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:28.368
that are showing more
emotion than you are.


1984
01:47:28.403 --> 01:47:31.404
I'm not sure what
the disconnection is with you,


1985
01:47:31.439 --> 01:47:32.944
but I am deeply
saddened by this.


1986
01:47:32.979 --> 01:47:35.947
This has been a tragic loss.
JANE: Absolutely, yes.


1987
01:47:35.982 --> 01:47:40.215
MS. HINA: And I have every right
to feel this way, Jane.


1988
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:42.448
I certainly have every right
to ask for a day off


1989
01:47:42.483 --> 01:47:43.856
to attend her funeral.

1990

JANE: Oh, I know.
I couldn't believe it either.

When I saw it on the news,
I was shocked.


1992
01:47:47.664 --> 01:47:52.194
MS. HINA: Laura was more than
just a news item to me, Jane.

We failed her.

MS. HINA: I was wondering if
you wanted to maybe have a chat


2055
01:50:51.573 --> 01:50:54.981
about Johnny now that
it's a little quieter here?


2056
01:50:55.016 --> 01:50:58.644
I think that obviously
I just thought we could talk


2057
01:50:58.679 --> 01:51:01.988
if you're open to it.

2058
01:51:02.023 --> 01:51:04.617
MARIE: Okay.

2059
01:51:07.831 --> 01:51:11.932
MS. HINA: How's your arm?

2060
01:51:11.967 --> 01:51:12.999
MARIE: It's okay.

2061
01:51:13.034 --> 01:51:15.661

[chuckles]

2064
01:51:21.636 --> 01:51:25.440
Marie, I've noticed
that Johnny seems to be


2065
01:51:25.475 --> 01:51:28.949
struggling to express
himself sometimes.


2066
01:51:28.984 --> 01:51:31.853
He's finding it
challenging to...


2067
01:51:31.888 --> 01:51:35.989
to tell us what he wants, and...

2068
01:51:36.024 --> 01:51:38.354
I wish that I knew
how to help him better.


2069
01:51:38.389 --> 01:51:40.422
I
-I just...

2070
01:51:40.457 --> 01:51:42.523
Marie, I'm no expert.

2071
01:51:42.558 --> 01:51:44.162
MARIE: I took him
to the walk-in clinic


2072
01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:47.935
and the guy didn't
want to assess him.


2073
01:51:47.970 --> 01:51:49.871
MS. HINA: Right.

2074
01:51:49.906 --> 01:51:52.104
It's...

2075
01:51:52.139 --> 01:51:53.369
It's so complicated.

2076
01:51:53.404 --> 01:51:55.701
They don't do assessments
at the walk-in.


2077
01:51:55.736 --> 01:51:57.043
They should have told you.

2078
01:51:57.078 --> 01:51:59.210
You actually...
you need a family doctor


2079
01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:00.706
to be able to get
the assessment,


2080
01:52:00.741 --> 01:52:02.378
and then the referral.

2081
01:52:02.413 --> 01:52:05.018
MARIE: I don't have
a family doctor.


2082
01:52:05.053 --> 01:52:06.547
MS. HINA: Okay.

2083
01:52:06.582 --> 01:52:08.021
Okay.

2084
01:52:08.056 --> 01:52:10.551
So let's figure that out first.

2085
01:52:10.586 --> 01:52:15.127
I have a friend of mine
that works at East York General.


2086
01:52:15.162 --> 01:52:18.625
I'm sure if I called her,
she'd be open to seeing Johnny.


2087
01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:20.825
MARIE: I don't even know
when I'd have time to go there.


2088
01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:22.332
I have to pick up
the kids from school,


2089
01:52:22.367 --> 01:52:25.566
and then I have to get them
home and cook them dinner,


2090
01:52:25.601 --> 01:52:27.634
and then put them in bed.

2091
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:31.374
And then I have to get--
MS. HINA: Marie, I'll take you.


2092
01:52:36.051 --> 01:52:39.250
I'd be happy to.

2093
01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:43.650
Look, Marie, I can't imagine

2094
01:52:43.685 --> 01:52:47.027
how challenging it must be to...

2095
01:52:49.097 --> 01:52:51.130
...take all of this on.

2096
01:52:54.630 --> 01:52:57.004
MARIE: He's my son.

2097
01:52:57.039 --> 01:52:58.830
MS. HINA: I know.

2098
01:52:58.865 --> 01:53:01.470
And I see how much you love him.

2099
01:53:05.949 --> 01:53:08.642
And so it's okay, Marie.

2100
01:53:10.811 --> 01:53:13.416
You're doing a great job.

2101
01:53:13.451 --> 01:53:16.056
And you don't need to have
all of the answers right now.


2102
01:53:16.091 --> 01:53:20.753
We can take
the first step together.

I just knew that

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:14.015
there was something
different about Johnny.


2118
01:54:14.050 --> 01:54:17.150
I know that there's a way
to communicate with him.


2119
01:54:17.185 --> 01:54:18.778
Like, he has his own
special language;

I just don't know what it is.

MARIE: He doesn't
pay attention to us.


2124
01:54:28.856 --> 01:54:31.032
Like, he does his own thing.

2125
01:54:31.067 --> 01:54:32.627
You just have to
keep an eye on him.


2126
01:54:32.662 --> 01:54:35.036
Like, you have to
watch him constantly.


2127
01:54:35.071 --> 01:54:36.466
Like, you can't take
your eyes off him.


2128
01:54:36.501 --> 01:54:38.600
You have to, like,
lock cupboards.


2129
01:54:38.635 --> 01:54:41.603
We have to make sure
that everything's put away.


2130
01:54:41.638 --> 01:54:45.178
If you leave something out,
he'll find it.


2131
01:54:45.213 --> 01:54:48.016
Johnny has taken markers

2132
01:54:48.051 --> 01:54:49.875
and written all over everything.

2133
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:53.648
His worst case scenario,

2134
01:54:53.683 --> 01:54:57.223
he has rubbed his poop
all over the place,


2135
01:54:57.258 --> 01:54:59.984
and then I have to
clean it up, and...


2136
01:55:00.019 --> 01:55:01.491
he runs all over the place

2137
01:55:01.526 --> 01:55:03.229
when we're at
the literacy centre.


2138
01:55:03.264 --> 01:55:06.067
He'll go to one thing

2139
01:55:06.102 --> 01:55:07.893
and then he'll play with it
for a little bit,


2140
01:55:07.928 --> 01:55:09.235
and then he'll go
to something else.


2141
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:11.468
And then he always goes
back to the light switch,


2142
01:55:11.503 --> 01:55:13.536
and he turns it on and off
and on and off.


2143
01:55:13.571 --> 01:55:15.175
And then you take
him away from there,


2144
01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:16.374
and then he goes back.

2145
01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:18.574
He'll keep going back
to the same thing.


2146
01:55:18.609 --> 01:55:20.081
And if you take
him away from it,


2147
01:55:20.116 --> 01:55:23.909
he gets super frustrated.

2148
01:55:23.944 --> 01:55:26.219
See what I mean?

2149
01:55:27.849 --> 01:55:31.752
JOHNNY: [humming]

2150
01:55:31.787 --> 01:55:35.525
DOCTOR: What are you
looking at, Johnny?


2151
01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:38.198
You looking at
the leaves out there?


2152
01:55:38.233 --> 01:55:40.794
Yeah, there's lots, hey?

2153
01:55:48.705 --> 01:55:51.772
DOCTOR: It does appear
that Johnny is displaying


2154
01:55:51.807 --> 01:55:53.609
autistic disorder.

2155
01:55:53.644 --> 01:55:55.941
And he's operating at
about a 12-month capacity.


2156
01:55:55.976 --> 01:55:57.184
Okay?

2157
01:55:57.219 --> 01:55:59.780
So this could mean
that Johnny may never


2158
01:55:59.815 --> 01:56:02.288
speak in full sentences.

2159
01:56:02.323 --> 01:56:03.553
We can look at some services;

2160
01:56:03.588 --> 01:56:05.357
we can improve
his communication,


2161
01:56:05.392 --> 01:56:07.425
but he will not communicate
like his peers


2162
01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:11.264
or like other
children his age.


2163
01:56:11.299 --> 01:56:13.365
That means that Johnny
might always need


2164
01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:14.861
supports in his life.

2165
01:56:14.896 --> 01:56:18.535
So Johnny may never be
independent with his toileting.


2166
01:56:18.570 --> 01:56:20.306
He might always
need personal care.


2167
01:56:20.341 --> 01:56:22.440
He might never
live independently.


2168
01:56:22.475 --> 01:56:25.608
And he might always require
somebody there for him.


2169
01:56:25.643 --> 01:56:27.709
So it's something
to think about,


2170
01:56:27.744 --> 01:56:30.547
maybe long-term planning
for yourself as you age,


2171
01:56:30.582 --> 01:56:32.549
and who will look after Johnny.

2172
01:56:32.584 --> 01:56:33.616
Okay?

2173
01:56:33.651 --> 01:56:36.157
As you do get older,
or when you do pass away,


2174
01:56:36.192 --> 01:56:39.721
who will be there
to look after him?
