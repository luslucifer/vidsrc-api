And I say that because
it's in fact the next day.

to clean all this shit up


169
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.159

I'm not kidding.

go to the bathroom,

and then we will take him home.

00:16:42.886 --> 00:16:44.519
Scott: Yeah, well
reading a couple pages


327
00:16:44.521 --> 00:16:46.687
in a fucking manual
doesn't make you king


328
00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:48.422
of this crisis plan, okay?

329
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.226
Look, there.

330
00:16:52.729 --> 00:16:55.229
See, I got a text.

331
00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:56.764
You know what that means?

332
00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.132
World's still out there.

333
00:16:58.134 --> 00:17:00.034

Josh: Wanna sit down?

336
00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:23.357
Scott: No, I don't
wanna sit down.


337
00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.493
You know what I wanna do?
I'll tell you what I wanna do.


338
00:17:25.495 --> 00:17:28.129
I want to open
this fucking door.


339
00:17:31.768 --> 00:17:33.868
Josh, turn that shit off.

340
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.636
Amy: We're not turning off
our only point of contact


341
00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.071
with the outside world.

342
00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.774
Scott: Are you fucking stupid?

343
00:17:39.776 --> 00:17:42.243
I got a text. My mom
texted me from Dubai.


344
00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:43.911
Amy: One text doesn't
prove anything.


345
00:17:44.547 --> 00:17:46.714
Josh: It could be a satellite
bouncing off delayed signals.


346
00:17:46.716 --> 00:17:48.783
It doesn't prove there's
anybody out there.


347
00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:49.850
Scott: Turn that shit off!

348
00:17:49.852 --> 00:17:51.852
Amy: Leave it on.
Chris: Easy, Scott.


349
00:17:51.854 --> 00:17:53.020
Scott: Well then get
some fucking headphones.


350
00:17:53.022 --> 00:17:55.856
Amy: Keep it on. If
there's someone out there,


351
00:17:55.858 --> 00:17:57.258
they need to be able to hear us.

352
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.462
Scott: Jesus, I am so sick of
your stupid shit, you bitch!


353
00:18:01.464 --> 00:18:03.097
Jesus.

354
00:18:03.099 --> 00:18:05.199
Kit: Back off.

355
00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:06.367
(suspecful music)

356
00:18:06.369 --> 00:18:07.401
Scott: Okay.

357
00:18:07.403 --> 00:18:08.436
Kit: You stay out of this.

358
00:18:11.774 --> 00:18:12.974
Kit: Apologize.

359
00:18:13.476 --> 00:18:15.209

360
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:16.577
I swear to God.

361
00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:18.879
I'll put a bullet through
your fucking head.


362
00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:24.185
Scott: I'm sorry, okay?

363
00:18:29.892 --> 00:18:31.792
Now we have a problem
to solve here.


364
00:18:31.794 --> 00:18:33.861
And I think it'd be best
if we put our efforts


365
00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.863
towards that instead
of having to babysit


366
00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.798
the oldest person in here.

367
00:18:38.968 --> 00:18:40.167
Right?

368
00:18:40.169 --> 00:18:41.202
Chris: Yeah.

369
00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.303
Yeah, you're right.

370
00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.340
So why doesn't everybody just

371
00:18:49.979 --> 00:18:51.012
breathe?

372
00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.916

did you find that?

Kit: Closet in the back.

Kit: Yeah.

379
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:14.835
I mean, it was in a case.

380
00:19:14.837 --> 00:19:16.037
Chris: Okay, um.

381
00:19:18.174 --> 00:19:20.474
Do you wanna show me
where you got this from?


382
00:19:26.683 --> 00:19:28.015
Trav: You okay?

383
00:19:28.017 --> 00:19:29.317
Scott: I can't fucking breathe.

384
00:19:29.319 --> 00:19:32.153
There is no air and
my heart is pounding


385
00:19:32.155 --> 00:19:34.522
out of my fucking
chest, all right?


386
00:19:34.524 --> 00:19:35.956
And you know what, bro?

387
00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.091
I'm starting to
get a bad feeling.


388
00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.994
Like a real bad
feeling, alright?


389
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.829
Fuck.

390
00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:51.339
Chris: Everything's
gonna be okay.

Amy: Based on?

392
00:20:04.187 --> 00:20:05.553
You may wanna
start saving those.

go cold turkey?

oh we're in trouble down here.

See I got brothers here

Half family.

They should at least
half look out for me.

You should come with me.

and water here.

We have no idea
what's out there.

If they take them, that's
it. You're stuck in here.

You can leave, but,

453
00:25:56.172 --> 00:25:58.839
Scott: This is a fucking
deathtrap down here!


454
00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:01.608
All right, even if you're right
about the water holding up,


455
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.844
even if the world's gone
to some kind of shit,


456
00:26:05.214 --> 00:26:07.381
you've only got another
eight months left.

Wouldn't you rather know, huh?

458
00:26:12.254 --> 00:26:17.157
Wouldn't any of you rather
make some kind of effort?

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:19.226
Amy: You need to
leave us a suit.


460
00:26:19.228 --> 00:26:20.427
You can't take both.

461
00:26:20.429 --> 00:26:22.730
(scoffs)
Scott: Yeah, the fuck I can't.


462
00:26:22.732 --> 00:26:23.797
You guys are just gonna sit here

463
00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:26.133
and follow Kitty dick's
little crisis plan.


464
00:26:26.135 --> 00:26:27.634
Amy: We might need
one in an emergency.


465
00:26:27.636 --> 00:26:29.203
Scott: Yeah, well you know
what, this is an emergency.


466
00:26:29.205 --> 00:26:31.805
Josh: No, she's right.
You can't have both.


467
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:33.607
Scott: (sigh)
Okay, genius, okay.


468
00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:35.242
If I can't have
both, then who gets


469
00:26:35.244 --> 00:26:37.511
the second suit, huh?
The one fucking suit.


470
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:39.546
Because when shit
goes tits up in here


471
00:26:39.548 --> 00:26:42.483
and believe me, it will,
who gets the suit, huh?


472
00:26:42.485 --> 00:26:43.617
Trav: Amy.

473
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.652
Scott: Oh come on.

474
00:26:45.654 --> 00:26:47.921
Why does she get the one thing
that's gonna help you guys--


475
00:26:47.923 --> 00:26:49.289
Amy: Because I'm pregnant.

476
00:26:52.995 --> 00:26:54.495
I'm pregnant.

477
00:26:57.733 --> 00:27:00.267
Scott: Come on, bullshit.
Bullshit you're pregnant.


478
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:01.668
You're going to
college in the fall.


479
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.703
Amy: Uh huh.

480
00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:06.073
And I'll let you do the
math on that one, genius.


481
00:27:06.742 --> 00:27:08.675
Scott: You're pregnant,
Trav: She's pregnant.


482
00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:11.512
Kit: The second suit stays.

483
00:27:13.182 --> 00:27:14.848
Scott: Kit, what the fuck, come
on. We talked about this.


484
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.517
I can't leave them with no suit

485
00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:18.152
and I'm not going
out there without--


486
00:27:18.154 --> 00:27:19.386
Scott: Yes, we're
gonna get halfway to...


487
00:27:19.388 --> 00:27:20.821

anything down here.

Come on, let's go, let's go.

a coffin, Chris.


498
00:27:41.243 --> 00:27:43.811
All right bro, it's
a big fucking coffin.


499

you can't come back,

suit or no suit.

501

radioactive to the point


502

give it another week.

Scott: No.

505

Why don't you come
with me, Chris, huh?


506

bro, come with me, please.

Please, I need someone, man.

We can get 2,000 calories

seem to be the only one


570
00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:10.310
that holds unpopular
opinions here,


571
00:32:12.981 --> 00:32:14.081
sorry Amy.

572
00:32:15.184 --> 00:32:16.149
But if you were,

573
00:32:18.987 --> 00:32:21.121
maybe we should think
about an abortion.


574
00:32:24.726 --> 00:32:28.028
Kit: It sounds terrible
but it's safer by far.


575
00:32:28.831 --> 00:32:30.664
And it saves resources.

576
00:32:36.238 --> 00:32:37.971
Just something to think about.

581

I just,

582

sometimes I can
be a little blunt.

done with the place.

I just wanted to say,
we'll get through this.

588

Maybe a little charming.

654
00:41:04.779 --> 00:41:07.780
Camilla: She was taking food,
Josh. I know what I saw.


655
00:41:09.284 --> 00:41:11.417
You may not realize this
because of where you grew up


656
00:41:11.419 --> 00:41:14.554
but in the real world,
bad shit does happen.


657
00:41:14.556 --> 00:41:17.657
People lie and they
cheat and they steal.


658
00:41:19.027 --> 00:41:20.660
And people die.

659
00:41:22.664 --> 00:41:23.830
Josh: Okay, Jesus.

660
00:41:24.165 --> 00:41:25.431
Your mom died.

661
00:41:26.635 --> 00:41:28.701
Doesn't make you the queen
of everything shitty.


662
00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:32.705
Camilla: That's not fair.

663
00:41:32.707 --> 00:41:34.273
Josh: All our moms are dead.

664
00:41:36.578 --> 00:41:38.211
So fucking save it.

665
00:41:43.885 --> 00:41:46.052
Camilla: I'm sorry.

666
00:41:46.054 --> 00:41:47.320
Josh: I'm sorry too.

667
00:41:56.131 --> 00:41:57.330
Trav: Hi.

668
00:42:00.802 --> 00:42:02.669
Sorry, just passing out lunch.

669
00:42:08.076 --> 00:42:10.610
You know, I always pictured

670
00:42:10.612 --> 00:42:15.014
the end of the world as
like a big inclusive orgy.


671
00:42:15.016 --> 00:42:18.017
But, no.

672
00:42:18.019 --> 00:42:20.653
Even the apocalypse
is heteronormative.


673
00:42:36.438 --> 00:42:38.604
Josh: Great expectations.

674
00:42:43.878 --> 00:42:45.445
That was a memorable day

675
00:42:46.314 --> 00:42:48.548
for it made great changes in me.

676
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:52.452
But it is the same
with any life.


677
00:42:53.254 --> 00:42:56.656
Imagine one selected
day struck out of it


678
00:42:56.658 --> 00:42:59.959
and think how different
its course would have been.


679
00:43:01.763 --> 00:43:03.362
Pause you who read this

680
00:43:03.364 --> 00:43:06.399
and think for a moment
of the long chain


681
00:43:06.401 --> 00:43:10.837
of iron or gold, of
thorns or flowers,


682
00:43:10.839 --> 00:43:12.972
that would never have bound you.

683
00:43:14.542 --> 00:43:16.743
But for the formation
of the first link


684
00:43:16.745 --> 00:43:19.312
on one memorable day.

685
00:43:32.894 --> 00:43:36.863
Chris: We are in Bunker

686
00:43:36.865 --> 00:43:38.397
requesting assistance please.

687
00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:42.668
Repeat, we are in bunker 1899

688
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.404
Canandega Lane requesting
assistance please.


689

assistance please.


692
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.719
Repeat, we are in bunker one...

693
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:04.257
Repeat, we are in bunker

694
00:44:04.259 --> 00:44:06.959

Amy: Chris.

696
00:44:13.368 --> 00:44:14.534
You need to sleep.

697
00:44:20.508 --> 00:44:21.507
Chris.

698
00:44:28.883 --> 00:44:30.817
(suspenseful music)

699
00:44:31.986 --> 00:44:34.086
Josh: We can't let him in.
We'll all be sick in a day!


700
00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:35.588
Chris: Josh, there is no proof
that there is anything--


701
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.956
Trav: He's writing
something else!

wanna come back in here?

Chris: We can't just
leave him out there.


714
00:45:29.344 --> 00:45:30.743
We need to know what's going on.

715

Camilla: Yeah.

00:47:35.803 --> 00:47:37.269
I don't know, I
thought we could have


729
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:39.205
a little memorial or something.

730
00:47:43.244 --> 00:47:44.844
Add whoever you want.

731

Trav: No offense, Camilla.

732
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:57.623
But the tree looks kinda
like a mushroom cloud.


733

Camilla: Well fuck.

734
00:48:08.169 --> 00:48:10.102
Yeah it does.
(laughing)


735
00:48:10.104 --> 00:48:13.039
It's a nuclear killer tree,
it's a tree of mass destruction.


736
00:48:13.041 --> 00:48:14.073
Awesome.

739
00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:38.564
I know this isn't something
either of you asked for.


740
00:48:39.967 --> 00:48:41.867
But I decided it's
safer to wait.


741
00:48:44.238 --> 00:48:47.706
So if no one comes for
us, I might have the baby.


742
00:48:49.444 --> 00:48:51.610
So I was wondering
if you guys might...


743
00:48:53.948 --> 00:48:55.614
Kit: Yes.

744
00:48:57.285 --> 00:48:58.751

For your baby.

762

Thank you.

Forgotten.

another fat joke?

to do something.

There needs to be rules
against stuff like that.

baby from there too, Kit,

same as babies.

779

My mom did a lot
of stupid things.


780
00:52:45.479 --> 00:52:46.578
Smoked a pack a
day, for example,


781
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.047
gave herself cancer.

782
00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:51.016
Kit: I'm sorry.

783
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.720
The one thing she said to me,

784
00:52:54.722 --> 00:52:56.789
over and over again,
she swore by it


785
00:52:56.791 --> 00:52:58.257
like a fucking
religion, she said


786
00:52:58.259 --> 00:53:00.326
"Never trust a girl
with shifty eyes."


787

You think I stole food.

You went out and took the
suit off Scott's body?

Chris: You should have
consulted with us.

Josh: Have you done an
updated radiation reading?

You should up your
iodine probably.

I keep my room, you stay out.

803
00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:23.008
We split off the
remaining resources.

Food, water,
medicine, everything.


805
00:54:27.648 --> 00:54:29.515
I want my share.

806
00:54:30.918 --> 00:54:32.818
Divide it into sevens.

807
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.052
Trav: Why sevens?

808

Kit: The baby.

Josh: This isn't right.

810
00:54:37.758 --> 00:54:39.191
We were better off
pooling resources.

Kit: I am not
asking for opinions.


812
00:54:42.963 --> 00:54:44.696
I am done pooling.

813
00:54:46.133 --> 00:54:48.000
Josh: We need to vote.

814
00:54:48.436 --> 00:54:50.068
Amy: We didn't vote
on Scott leaving.


815
00:54:51.338 --> 00:54:53.138
We didn't vote on
letting him back in.


816
00:54:53.808 --> 00:54:55.174
Josh: So?

817
00:54:55.176 --> 00:54:56.575
Amy: So let's not pretend
this is some kind


818
00:54:56.577 --> 00:54:57.876
of functional democracy.
