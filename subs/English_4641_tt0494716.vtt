1
00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:20.532
SOME PEOPLE THINK
THAT HIGH SCHOOL


2
00:00:20.556 --> 00:00:22.360
IS THE WORST TIME
IN A PERSON'S LIFE.


3
00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:25.399
WHAT WITH THE POPULARS,
THE PEER PRESSURE,


4
00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:26.501
AND THE PIMPLES,

5
00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:28.940
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH
FOR SOME KIDS TO HANDLE


6
00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:29.942
ON A $10 A WEEK ALLOWANCE.

7
00:00:29.976 --> 00:00:32.948
BUT THIS ISN'T
ONE OF THOSE STORIES.


8
00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:34.952
MEET ISABELLA.

9
00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:37.924
BUT YOU CAN CALL HER, IS.

10
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:42.833
HIGH SCHOOL.

11
00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:46.741
A FANTASTICAL KINGDOM
OF PROMISE AND PERIL.


12
00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:48.678
WITH WARRIORS.

13
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.954
WIZARDS.

14
00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:56.728
AND WITCHES.

15
00:00:58.698 --> 00:00:59.767
SHH.

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.606
A BIZARRE WORLD
WHERE THE RULES OF SOCIETY


17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.046
NO LONGER APPLY.

18
00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.450
IT IS HERE WHERE DESTINY FINDS

19
00:01:07.483 --> 00:01:10.056
THE INCOMPARABLE, IS.

20
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.299
AND HER NEVER-ENDING
BATTLE FOR TRUTH


21
00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:18.372
JUSTICE, AND GYM CLASS.

22
00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:24.417
THE ROPE.

23
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.654
THE SCOURGE OF EVERY
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT


24
00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:27.656
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.

25
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.096
BUT IT ISN'T THE LENGTH
OF THE ROPE.


26
00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:33.602
IT'S THE STRENGTH
OF THE GIRL CLIMBING IT.


27
00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.139
AND LUCKILY, IN THIS CASE,

28
00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:38.345
THAT GIRL IS, IS.

29
00:02:02.826 --> 00:02:03.628
MARCO.

30
00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:06.568
VINCENT. WAS IT THE SMILE,

31
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:08.238
THE DIMPLES, THE BICEPS,

32
00:02:08.272 --> 00:02:11.278
THAT MADE HIM THE CUTEST
BOY IN THE KINGDOM?


33
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:14.184
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

34
00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:19.059
JAMIE, YOU'RE NEXT.

35
00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:22.166
OK. SO THIS ISN'T THAT STORY.

36
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.239
AND IS IS JUST
A CHARACTER IN MY JOURNAL.


37
00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:27.343
IMPRESSIVE TIME, MR. VEGA.

38
00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:29.747
NEW STOPWATCH, MR. HEARN?

39
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.551
VERY NICE.

40
00:02:32.253 --> 00:02:35.559
HI. I DON'T FEEL VERY WELL.

41
00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:39.901
UNFORTUNATELY, 
AS HARD AS I TRY,

42
00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:41.905
I'M NO IS.

43
00:02:50.556 --> 00:02:51.691
I CAN'T DO IT.

44
00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:54.764
I REALLY CAN'T. I'M SORRY.

45
00:02:58.037 --> 00:02:58.973
WATCH IT.

46
00:02:59.006 --> 00:02:59.941
THIS IS THE STORY

47
00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:01.544
OF HOW MY PRIVATE,
PERSONAL JOURNAL


48
00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:03.883
BECAME A BEST SELLER.

49
00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.427
HEY, J. HOW WAS GYM?

50
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.764
I GOT STUCK ON THE ROPE AGAIN.

51
00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:12.466
OUCH.

52
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.468
MY WORDS EXACTLY.

53
00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:15.739
OH, LET'S BOUNCE.
WE CAN'T BE LATE
FOR ENGLISH.


54
00:03:15.772 --> 00:03:17.710
BUT WE HAVE TO
SAVE THE PLANET FIRST.


55
00:03:17.743 --> 00:03:20.749
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE
AMBITIOUS BEFORE LUNCH?


56
00:03:20.782 --> 00:03:22.320
"THE PLANET"
IS A THEATER DOWNTOWN,


57
00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:23.889
AND THEY'RE GOING
TO TEAR IT DOWN


58
00:03:23.923 --> 00:03:25.993
UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

59
00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:26.761
I ALREADY DID.

60
00:03:26.794 --> 00:03:30.001
I DESIGNED AND PAINTED
THE POSTERS.


61
00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:33.007
YEAH. BUT NO ONE CAN READ THEM.

62
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:36.280
I WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH CUBISM.

63
00:03:36.614 --> 00:03:38.986
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO BE
EXPERIMENTING WITH DETENTION


64
00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.031
IF WE DON'T GET A MOVE ON.

65
00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:40.957
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY PROTEST?

66
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.666
MAYBE WE CAN SAVE
THE PLANET ALONG THE WAY.


67
00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:49.006
SAVE THE PLANET? SAVE... NO?

68
00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.542
SAVE THE PLANET.

69
00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:53.047
HELP SAVE THE PLANET.

70
00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.087
SAVE THE PLANET.

71
00:03:58.425 --> 00:03:59.961
SAVE...

72
00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:02.032
UH
-OH.

73
00:04:02.065 --> 00:04:04.103
THE POPULARS.

74
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:06.841
THERE SHE WAS.

75
00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:10.649
THE EVIL AND FEARED SAWYER.

76
00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:13.822
UH, I MEAN, MYRNA.

77
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:16.127
A CHEERLEADER SO VILE,

78
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.667
EVEN MILK CURDLED
AT THE SOUND OF HER NAME.


79
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.602
SHE ENTERED THE HALLWAY

80
00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:23.909
WITH HER CLONE HORRIFIC COHORTS.

81
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.086
UH... JAMIE.

82
00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:31.190
OH, I WAS GONNA SAY GEEK.

83
00:04:31.223 --> 00:04:34.063
MYRNA WAS ROTTEN TO THE CORE.

84
00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:35.699
I'M SORRY.
DID YOU WANT SOMETHING?


85
00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:38.738
YES, I WANTED YOU TO MOVE.
YOU'RE BLOCKING MY LOCKER.


86
00:04:38.772 --> 00:04:41.844
RIGHT. SORRY.

87
00:04:42.546 --> 00:04:43.347
I HEARD THE TRYOUTS

88
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:44.283
ARE GONNA BE REALLY
INTENSE THIS YEAR.


89
00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:46.788
OH, ARE YOU GUYS
TRYING OUT FOR CHEERLEADING?


90
00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:48.993
DUH. ARE YOU?

91
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:51.130
YOU AREN'T.

92
00:04:51.163 --> 00:04:51.664
NO.

93
00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:53.034
NO. I DIDN'T THINK SO.

94
00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:54.871
THAT'S A VERY GOOD CALL
ON YOUR PART.


95
00:04:58.077 --> 00:04:58.979
RISKING LIFE AND LIMB,

96
00:04:59.013 --> 00:05:02.085
IS NEW SHE HAD TO DESTROY MYRNA

97
00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:03.154
AND HER VICIOUS CLIQUE.

98
00:05:03.187 --> 00:05:06.260
BEFORE THEY CRUSHED
EVERY GIRL'S SPIRIT.


99
00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:09.033
WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE NICE,


100
00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:10.836
THEN BE GONE.

101
00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:15.111
IS! IS! IS! IS!

102
00:05:15.145 --> 00:05:18.818
AND WITH MYRNA GONE,
EVERYONE CHEERED.


103
00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:27.971
JAMIE.

104
00:05:28.004 --> 00:05:31.043
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE
WITH THE CLASS?


105
00:05:31.077 --> 00:05:32.546
NO, MISS GALLAGHER.

106
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.018
THEN PAY ATTENTION.

107
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:36.821
MARCO.

108
00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:38.725
YOU'RE NEXT.

109
00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.048
IT'S NOT VERY GOOD.

110
00:05:54.123 --> 00:05:55.325
"I HAVE A SECRET.

111
00:05:55.358 --> 00:05:57.162
"DOES SHE, TOO?

112
00:05:57.195 --> 00:06:00.836
"THE QUIET GIRL
I THOUGHT I KNEW WHO...


113
00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:05.145
"CONTINUALLY MAKES ME SMILE.

114
00:06:05.178 --> 00:06:08.084
"I HAVE TO WONDER,
DOES SHE SEE ME


115
00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.656
"OR JUST MY MASK?

116
00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.025
INVISIBILITY."

117
00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:13.929
OH...

118
00:06:17.302 --> 00:06:18.404
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

119
00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:19.606
HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.

120
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.345
AND DON'T FORGET,
YOUR ESSAYS
FOR THE WRITING COMPETITION


121
00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.049
ARE DUE ON MONDAY.

122
00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.953
AND HE WRITES POETRY.

123
00:06:25.987 --> 00:06:27.857
IS THERE ANYTHING
MARCO CAN'T DO?


124
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:29.159
YEAH. WRITE POETRY.

125
00:06:29.193 --> 00:06:30.796
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

126
00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:31.865
TRUST ME, JAMIE,

127
00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:34.236
IF I WANTED TO WRITE
A POEM LIKE THAT,
I COULD'VE.


128
00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.975
HEY, THERE'S YOUR BROTHER.

129
00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:39.346
HEY, LENNY. WHAT'S UP?

130
00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:42.319
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
NEVER TO TALK TO ME.


131
00:06:42.352 --> 00:06:44.824
ESPECIALLY IN SCHOOL.

132
00:06:46.962 --> 00:06:48.131
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

133
00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:50.401
I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

134
00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:52.172
OH.

135
00:06:55.078 --> 00:06:58.017
SO, WANT TO HIT
THE COMIC BOOK STORE
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY?


136
00:06:58.051 --> 00:06:59.855
I CAN'T. I HAVE TO WORK.

137
00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:01.390
WE'RE SERVING PIZZA UNTIL 5:00

138
00:07:01.423 --> 00:07:03.294
IF ANYBODY WANTS A SLICE.

139
00:07:03.327 --> 00:07:05.198
OH, WHAT'S TODAY'S SPECIAL?

140
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:06.233
DON'T ASK.

141
00:07:06.267 --> 00:07:07.035
IT WAS DISGUSTING.

142
00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.041
THE OTHER DAY,
HE PUT RAW FISH ON IT.


143
00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:31.050
LET'S GO, JAMIE.

144
00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:33.154
THIS PIZZA'S NOT GOING
TO DELIVER ITSELF.


145
00:07:33.187 --> 00:07:35.258
WHAT IS THAT STENCH?

146
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:37.295
THAT IS THE SMELL OF THE FUTURE.

147
00:07:37.329 --> 00:07:40.235
THE SMELL OF YOUR FUTURE.

148
00:07:41.838 --> 00:07:44.009
LIVER AND ONION PIZZA.

149
00:07:44.043 --> 00:07:45.078
EW.

150
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:45.812
YOU'RE NOT MAKING THAT

151
00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:47.315
FOR THE SLUMBER PARTY, ARE YOU?

152
00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:48.886
MAYBE HALF?

153
00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:50.221
OH, MR. BARTLETT, PLEASE.

154
00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:51.457
DADDY, DON'T.

155
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.963
BUT GIRLS, IF I DON'T
GET SOME TESTERS
FOR MY NEW CREATIONS,


156
00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:55.507
HOW AM I GONNA KNOW
IF THEY'RE ANY GOOD?


157
00:07:55.531 --> 00:07:57.235
TRUST US. TRUST US.

158
00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:58.137
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

159
00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:01.979
IT'S OUR FUTURE,
AND APPARENTLY, IT STINKS.


160
00:08:02.012 --> 00:08:03.347
EW, RALPH.

161
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:05.285
IT'S LIVER AND ONION.

162
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.555
YOU PUT LIVER AND ONIONS
ON A PIZZA?


163
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:10.930
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST
STAY OLD SCHOOL, MR. B.


164
00:08:10.963 --> 00:08:12.934
YOUR PLAIN CHEESE IS STILL
THE BEST AROUND.


165
00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:16.909
BUT, I'M TRYING TO APPEAL
TO A WIDER AUDIENCE.


166
00:08:16.942 --> 00:08:18.411
A MORE DISCERNING PALATE.

167
00:08:18.444 --> 00:08:20.315
EW! EW!

168
00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:21.317
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

169
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.321
I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE, HONEY,

170
00:08:23.354 --> 00:08:25.591
BUT YOU MIGHT BE DISCERNING US

171
00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.364
RIGHT OUT OF BUSINESS.

172
00:08:33.574 --> 00:08:36.680
UH, EXCUSE ME. UH...

173
00:08:36.713 --> 00:08:37.315
JAMIE.

174
00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:39.419
I'M IN YOUR ENGLISH CLASS.

175
00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:43.061
AND LUNCH, AND HISTORY.

176
00:08:43.094 --> 00:08:44.196
AND MATH.

177
00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:46.033
YOU ARE?

178
00:08:48.271 --> 00:08:50.275
I SAID, NO ICE.

179
00:08:51.743 --> 00:08:52.545
OH, MY BAD.

180
00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:54.483
LET ME GET YOU ANOTHER.

181
00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:56.653
AAH!

182
00:08:57.755 --> 00:08:59.126
OH, MY BAD.

183
00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.997
LET ME GET YOU ANOTHER ONE.

184
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.763
THANKS.

185
00:09:01.797 --> 00:09:04.736
SMILE. ONLY 2 HOURS
UNTIL CLOSING.


186
00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:08.979
YES. BUT 3 1/2
MORE YEARS
OF HIGH SCHOOL.


187
00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:15.491
WHAT DID YOU GUYS
DO YOUR ESSAYS ON?


188
00:09:15.525 --> 00:09:16.995
HOW TERM PAPERS ARE A WASTE

189
00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:19.399
OF OUR DWINDLING,
NATURAL RESOURCES.


190
00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:20.135
OH, SWEET.

191
00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:22.039
I CRANKED OUT A COUPLE OF PAGES

192
00:09:22.072 --> 00:09:23.774
ON HOW I WOULD CHANGE
THE BREAK TIMES


193
00:09:23.807 --> 00:09:25.511
BETWEEN CLASSES
TO MAKE OUR LIVES,


194
00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:27.082
OH, SO MORE EFFICIENT.

195
00:09:27.115 --> 00:09:27.850
THAT'S IT?

196
00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:30.321
YES. IT'S A VERY
CONVINCING PAPER.


197
00:09:30.355 --> 00:09:31.223
WHY?

198
00:09:31.257 --> 00:09:32.192
BECAUSE THE WINNING ESSAY

199
00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:34.429
WILL BE PUBLISHED
IN THE EDUCATION TIMES.


200
00:09:34.463 --> 00:09:35.198
WELL, IT WON'T BE MINE.

201
00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:36.700
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU WOULD'VE COME UP


202
00:09:36.733 --> 00:09:37.502
WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT.

203
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.606
YOU ARE THE BEST
WRITER IN THE CLASS.


204
00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:41.277
HARDLY. ARE, TOO.

205
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.545
AM NOT.

206
00:09:42.579 --> 00:09:44.125
IF YOU'RE NOT A WRITER,
THEN WHY ARE YOU
WRITING ALL THE TIME?


207
00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:47.189
BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T
I'D HAVE A NUTTY.


208
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:49.693
OH, NO. MY PRINTER DIED.

209
00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:51.397
OH, NOW THE WORLD
WILL NEVER KNOW


210
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.503
HOW MUCH EASIER
OUR LIVES WOULD BE
BETWEEN CLASSES.


211
00:09:54.536 --> 00:09:57.275
DOESN'T LENNY HAVE A PRINTER?

212
00:09:57.309 --> 00:09:59.513
OH, YEAH. GOOD IDEA.

213
00:10:03.487 --> 00:10:04.423
HEY, LENNY?

214
00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:06.136
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO NEVER COME IN MY ROOM.


215
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.399
YEAH. BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD BORROW YOUR...


216
00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:13.507
HEY, YOU WROTE A SONG.

217
00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:14.443
BUT...

218
00:10:14.476 --> 00:10:16.447
I SAID, OUT.

219
00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:21.223
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
EMAIL IT TO ME,


220
00:10:21.257 --> 00:10:22.792
AND I'LL PRINT IT OUT
AT MY HOUSE.


221
00:10:22.825 --> 00:10:25.731
EXCELLENT IDEA.

222
00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:28.471
I JUST WISH I COULD
FIND SOMEBODY WHO...


223
00:10:28.504 --> 00:10:29.406
OH...

224
00:10:29.439 --> 00:10:31.777
UNDERSTANDS ME.

225
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.845
EVERY...

226
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.816
LINDSAY UNDERSTANDS YOU, RYDER.

227
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.487
SHUT UP. THAT'S SUCH A LIE.

228
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.655
COME ON, HARMONY.

229
00:10:37.689 --> 00:10:40.828
WHO DOESN'T LOVE RYDER DONOVAN?

230
00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:49.446
NO. NO. NO.

231
00:10:49.479 --> 00:10:50.281
OH, SHE IS A WITCH.

232
00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:52.652
DID YOU SEE WHO
SHE KILLED LAST WEEK?


233
00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:53.855
IF SHE KEEPS THIS UP,

234
00:10:53.888 --> 00:10:56.693
THEY'LL HAVE TO RECAST
THE ENTIRE SHOW.


235
00:10:56.727 --> 00:10:57.795
CHANGE THE CHANNEL.

236
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:58.898
SHE MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL.

237
00:10:58.932 --> 00:11:01.871
THIS ONE ACCIDENTAL
CLICK OF THE STYLUS...


238
00:11:01.904 --> 00:11:06.447
THAT ROCKETED MY PERSONAL,
PRIVATE JOURNAL
INTO CYBERSPACE


239
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.621
WOULD SEND A SHOCKWAVE
ROARING THROUGH
THE KINGDOM.


240
00:11:10.655 --> 00:11:14.529
ALTERING IT FOREVER.

241
00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:17.502
THINK OF YOUR FACE
AS A BLANK CANVAS.


242
00:11:17.535 --> 00:11:19.806
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE SHADING
AND COMPOSITION.


243
00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.510
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

244
00:11:21.543 --> 00:11:23.581
SHADING OUR CANVASSES.

245
00:11:23.614 --> 00:11:25.551
WHEN DID YOU START
SELLING THIS MAKE-UP?


246
00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:27.422
JUST LAST WEEK. IT'S NEW.

247
00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:28.357
IT'S CRUEL.

248
00:11:28.391 --> 00:11:30.428
THEY TEST ON ANIMALS.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.


249
00:11:30.461 --> 00:11:32.332
YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.


250
00:11:32.365 --> 00:11:33.334
LOOK, KID, I JUST WORK HERE.

251
00:11:33.367 --> 00:11:35.471
IF YOU'D LIKE
TO TAKE IT UP
WITH THE COMPANY,


252
00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:36.340
BE MY GUEST.

253
00:11:36.373 --> 00:11:39.713
DON'T THINK I WON'T.
LET'S GO, YOU GUYS.


254
00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:43.421
OH, WOW.

255
00:11:43.454 --> 00:11:45.892
DO YOUR MAKE-UP
IN THE DARK
THIS MORNING, GIRLS?


256
00:11:50.368 --> 00:11:53.707
YOU COULD'VE AT LEAST
LET US FINISH.


257
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:55.411
IT'S BEEN A MONTH.

258
00:11:55.445 --> 00:11:57.950
LET THE SHOCKWAVE BEGIN.

259
00:11:57.983 --> 00:11:59.018
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE...

260
00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.757
THEY ANNOUNCED THE WINNERS
OF THE ESSAY COMPETITION.


261
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.759
YAWN.

262
00:12:02.792 --> 00:12:04.596
OH, COME ON,
YOU MUST BE EXCITED.


263
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:06.099
YOU PRACTICALLY WROTE A NOVEL.

264
00:12:06.132 --> 00:12:07.702
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

265
00:12:07.735 --> 00:12:09.473
IT WAS 5 PAGES.

266
00:12:09.506 --> 00:12:11.477
WITH FOOTNOTES.

267
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.845
UH
-OH.

268
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.915
SERIOUSLY.

269
00:12:13.948 --> 00:12:16.487
MISS GALLAGHER SAID IT WAS
THE MOST PROVOCATIVE PAPER


270
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.956
SHE'S SEEN IN 15 YEARS.

271
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.426
PUH
-LEASE. LIKE JAMIE BARTLETT'S

272
00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:21.062
EVER SAID ANYTHING PROVOCATIVE.

273
00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:22.131
HONESTLY.

274
00:12:22.164 --> 00:12:23.033
JAMIE WHO?

275
00:12:23.066 --> 00:12:24.904
THEY CAN'T BE TALKING
ABOUT ME, I MEAN...


276
00:12:24.937 --> 00:12:28.945
BREAK TIMES
AREN'T PROVOCATIVE,
ARE THEY?


277
00:12:28.978 --> 00:12:30.047
BREAK TIME?

278
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.120
OH, NO. I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS THE FILE
YOU SENT ME.


279
00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:35.825
A STENCH WORSE THAN
LIVER AND ONION PIZZA


280
00:12:35.859 --> 00:12:38.764
FELL UPON THE HALLS.

281
00:12:38.998 --> 00:12:41.537
HEY! GUESS WHO WON THE CONTEST?

282
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.607
GUESS WHO WON THE CONTEST?

283
00:12:43.641 --> 00:12:47.682
NO!!!

MISS GALLAGHER.

291
00:13:07.655 --> 00:13:09.994

ISABELLA'S A VERY
REALISTIC CHARACTER.

LET'S LISTEN TO SAWYER FOR ONCE.

295

WAY TO GO, BARTLETT.

309
00:13:49.238 --> 00:13:51.509
GREAT STORY, JAMIE.

310
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.591
WOW. SO INSPIRING.

311
00:13:58.624 --> 00:14:01.797
I KNOW. NEXT TIME
RACHEL CALLS ME A COW,

WHERE YOU GOING?

315
00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:14.322
TO CRAWL UNDER A ROCK.

316
00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:15.424
WHY?

317
00:14:15.457 --> 00:14:17.370
I MEAN, YOU JUST WON
A THOUSAND DOLLAR
SAVINGS BOND.


318
00:14:17.394 --> 00:14:19.098
NO, I WAS JUST
PUBLICLY HUMILIATED


319
00:14:19.132 --> 00:14:20.267
WHEN MY JOURNAL WAS READ

320
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.770
IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE CLASS.

321
00:14:21.803 --> 00:14:23.340
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

322
00:14:23.373 --> 00:14:24.944

YES. AND IT WAS A MISTAKE.

AND NOW IT'S PUBLISHED.

326
00:14:34.763 --> 00:14:35.831
CHILL OUT.

327
00:14:35.866 --> 00:14:38.236
THIS WHOLE THING'S
GONNA BLOW OVER


328
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.639
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

329
00:14:39.673 --> 00:14:41.176
YOU THINK SO?

330
00:14:41.209 --> 00:14:42.913
I KNOW SO.

331
00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:46.854
ALL RIGHT?

332
00:14:46.888 --> 00:14:48.992
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

333
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.799
A BOOK?

334
00:14:52.832 --> 00:14:55.805
YES. THEY READ YOUR ESSAY
IN THE EDUCATION TIMES,


335
00:14:55.838 --> 00:14:59.813
AND THEY THINK THAT YOU
ARE A GREAT WRITER.


336
00:15:00.347 --> 00:15:02.451
LOOK, MOM, I... I JUST DON'T KNOW.

337
00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:05.725
I MEAN, THE HUMILIATION
HAS JUST DIED DOWN.


338
00:15:05.758 --> 00:15:09.032
AND I CAN'T SURVIVE
ANOTHER LUNCH
OF ZAPPING.


339
00:15:09.065 --> 00:15:09.799
JAMIE...

340
00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:12.839
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITY.


341
00:15:12.873 --> 00:15:15.845
I'D HATE TO SEE YOU PASS IT UP.

342
00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:16.981
WELL...

343
00:15:17.014 --> 00:15:19.920
I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE PAGES.

344
00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:38.123
NO MORE PAGES?

345
00:15:38.156 --> 00:15:40.360
WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE?

346
00:15:41.029 --> 00:15:42.031
PERSONAL PROPERTY.

347
00:15:42.064 --> 00:15:44.769
I CAN'T DO IT. NO WAY.

348
00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:49.078
JAMIE, YOU CAN'T
WALK AWAY FROM THIS


349
00:15:49.112 --> 00:15:50.547
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED.

350
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.819
I'M NOT SCARED.

351
00:15:52.853 --> 00:15:54.288
I'M NOT SCARED.

352
00:15:54.322 --> 00:15:56.059
THEN PROVE IT.

353
00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:08.350
OH, HONEY. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

354
00:16:08.383 --> 00:16:10.520
TRUST ME. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

355
00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:12.324
CAN I GET THAT IN WRITING?

356
00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:20.976
MOVE IT, WORM.

357
00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:21.878
ZAP, ZAP.

358
00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:23.882
HEY, MOM. I CHANGED MY MIND.

359
00:16:23.915 --> 00:16:25.217
IF I WRITE A BOOK,

360
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.890
THIS ZAPPING IS ONLY
GOING TO GET WORSE.


361
00:16:27.923 --> 00:16:29.894
YOU'RE WRITING A BOOK?

362
00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:32.064
SOUNDS LIKE A PIPE DREAM TO ME.

363
00:16:32.098 --> 00:16:33.833
AH!

364
00:16:34.068 --> 00:16:35.070
IN TWO SHORT MONTHS,

365
00:16:35.104 --> 00:16:36.941
THE PIPE DREAM
HAD BECOME A NIGHTMARE.


366
00:16:36.974 --> 00:16:38.978
AND MY PERSONAL, 
PRIVATE JOURNAL

367
00:16:39.012 --> 00:16:44.022
WAS ON ITS WAY
TO BECOMING
A NATIONAL BEST SELLER.


368
00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:48.864
HERE YOU GO, MISS GALLAGHER.

369
00:16:49.665 --> 00:16:50.969
THIS IS SO COOL.

370
00:16:51.002 --> 00:16:52.304
YOU'RE GONNA BECOME A CELEBRITY.

371
00:16:52.338 --> 00:16:54.977
I'LL HAVE TO DO YOUR PORTRAIT.

372
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:55.912
JAMIE.

373
00:16:55.946 --> 00:16:58.316
WOULD YOU SIGN MY COPY?

374
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.189
UH... NO.

375
00:17:03.026 --> 00:17:05.297
SHE'S SIGNING BOOKS!

376
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.470
"THE BIGGEST CRUSH
ON THE MOST POPULAR GUY...


377
00:17:25.504 --> 00:17:26.239
"I FELL IN LOVE WHEN ONE DAY

378
00:17:26.272 --> 00:17:27.708
"HE WAS SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.


379
00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:44.408
"WHERE DESTINY FINDS
THE INCOMPARABLE IS.


380
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:49.585
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

381
00:17:49.618 --> 00:17:52.424
STARTED A REVOLUTION.

382
00:17:54.195 --> 00:17:55.430
ZAP, ZAP, ZAP, ZAP.

383
00:18:01.742 --> 00:18:03.280
UH, EXCUSE ME.

384
00:18:03.313 --> 00:18:05.317
HERE YOU GO.

385
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.123
THANK YOU. HAVE A NICE DAY.

386
00:18:08.156 --> 00:18:09.625
WOW. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS CROWD?

387
00:18:09.658 --> 00:18:10.836
BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN THIS GOOD

388
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:13.400
SINCE WE
STOPPED SERVING
WHEATGRASS PIZZA.


389
00:18:13.433 --> 00:18:15.104
YOU DON'T THINK THE SIGN

390
00:18:15.137 --> 00:18:17.541
HAS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH IT, DO YOU?


391
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.116
WOW.

392
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:22.518
THIS IS AMAZING.

393
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:24.822
EVEN CHICKEN FEET
CAN'T KEEP THEM AWAY.


394
00:18:24.856 --> 00:18:26.292
LOOK, CAN WE TALK ABOUT ANYTHING

395
00:18:26.326 --> 00:18:28.730
BESIDES THAT STUPID BOOK?

396
00:18:29.332 --> 00:18:30.234
HEY, NOW.

397
00:18:30.267 --> 00:18:31.302
THE BOOK WAS INCREDIBLE.

398
00:18:31.336 --> 00:18:35.110
EMPOWERING. I FELT
LIKE I COULD
ZAP MYSELF ANYWHERE.


399
00:18:35.144 --> 00:18:35.744
DO ANYTHING.

400
00:18:35.777 --> 00:18:37.448
I WISH I COULD ZAP MYSELF

401
00:18:37.481 --> 00:18:39.853
OFF THE ENGLISH
REQUIREMENT READING LIST.


402
00:18:39.886 --> 00:18:41.622
HEY, JAMIE.

403
00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:43.426
I READ YOUR BOOK.

404
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.564
IT WAS... AWESOME.

405
00:18:45.597 --> 00:18:46.699
MARCO?

406
00:18:46.732 --> 00:18:48.570
WE'RE OVER HERE.

407
00:18:48.603 --> 00:18:51.576
I BETTER GET BACK.

408
00:18:54.081 --> 00:18:55.593
DO YOU BELIEVE
MARCO VEGA
READ YOUR BOOK?


409
00:18:55.617 --> 00:18:58.857
ONLY CAUSE YOU NAMED
THE ROMANTIC IDIOT
AFTER HIM.


410
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:00.727
IT IS SHOCKING.

411
00:19:01.729 --> 00:19:04.903
I MEAN, WHO KNEW HE COULD READ?

412
00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:07.007
HEY, JAMESON.

413
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.245
SHE'D NEVER EVEN KNOWN MY NAME

414
00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:11.850
IF IT WEREN'T ON THE COVER.

415
00:19:11.883 --> 00:19:13.921
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
WHEN THEY REALIZE


416
00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:17.428
THAT THE EVIL MYRNA
AND THE CLONES
ARE REALLY THEM?


417
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:18.263
GET OUT.

418
00:19:18.296 --> 00:19:19.632
YOU'RE KIDDING.

419
00:19:19.665 --> 00:19:20.467
NO. HOW ELSE WAS I

420
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.879
SUPPOSED TO COME UP
WITH A CHEERLEADER


421
00:19:21.903 --> 00:19:23.806
WHO WAS SO VILE
THAT MILK CURDLED


422
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.410
AT THE SOUND OF HER NAME?

423
00:19:25.444 --> 00:19:26.346
DON'T WORRY, JAMIE.

424
00:19:26.379 --> 00:19:27.882
AS SELF CENTERED AS THEY ARE,

425
00:19:27.915 --> 00:19:28.616
THEY WILL NEVER REALIZE

426
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.888
THE CHARACTERS
ARE BASED ON THEM.


427
00:19:30.921 --> 00:19:31.890
ARE WE IN THE BOOK?

428
00:19:31.923 --> 00:19:34.929
YES. YOU ARE LAURA
THE INVINCIBLE,


429
00:19:34.963 --> 00:19:36.867
AND YOU ARE
THE MAGNIFICENT MELODY.


430
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.906
BUT THEY'RE ONLY
THE COOLEST KIDS
IN THE KINGDOM.


431
00:19:39.939 --> 00:19:42.444
YEAH. IT'S MOSTLY FICTION.

432
00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:47.955
HEY, HOW ABOUT YOU PUT
THAT BOOK DOWN


433
00:19:47.989 --> 00:19:49.358
AND GIVE ME A HAND.

434
00:19:49.392 --> 00:19:50.427
PUT IT DOWN?

435
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.932
I'D LIKE TO THROW IT AT HER.

436
00:19:52.965 --> 00:19:53.700
COME ON, LENNY.

437
00:19:53.733 --> 00:19:55.637
CAN'T YOU BE HAPPY
FOR YOUR SISTER?


438
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.706
HAVE YOU READ THIS,

439
00:19:56.739 --> 00:19:57.951
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, BOOK?

440
00:19:57.975 --> 00:19:59.312
YEAH. IT'S PRETTY TERRIFIC.

441
00:19:59.345 --> 00:20:02.551
NOT IF YOU'RE KENNY
THE STINKY TROLL.


442
00:20:02.584 --> 00:20:03.320
COME ON, LENNY.

443
00:20:03.353 --> 00:20:04.889
THAT'S JUST A CHARACTER
IN A BOOK.


444
00:20:04.923 --> 00:20:07.929
HAS NO RESEMBLANCE
TO YOU WHATSOEVER.


445
00:20:09.097 --> 00:20:11.802
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
AROUND THE EARS.


446
00:20:12.037 --> 00:20:14.842
FANCY, CARTER, 
DO I PAY YOU TWO

447
00:20:14.876 --> 00:20:16.355
JUST TO SIT AROUND
AND EAT PIZZA ALL DAY?


448
00:20:16.379 --> 00:20:17.982
BUT YOU DON'T PAY US,
MRS. BARTLETT.


449
00:20:18.015 --> 00:20:21.822
I DO NOW.
PUT ON THOSE APRONS
AND GRAB A PIE.


450
00:20:33.947 --> 00:20:35.584
HERE YOU GO.

451
00:20:49.044 --> 00:20:51.850
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY PIZZAS
IN MY LIFE.


452
00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:52.985
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY

453
00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:54.822
HALF EATEN PIZZAS IN MY LIFE.

454
00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:55.901
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED

455
00:20:55.925 --> 00:20:57.704
THAT MOST OF THE CUSTOMERS
PICKED OFF THEIR TOPPINGS?


456
00:20:57.728 --> 00:21:00.033
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE HERE TO SEE JAMIE,


457
00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:01.168
NOT EAT PIZZA.

458
00:21:01.201 --> 00:21:03.673
AND WILL YOU PLEASE
NOT LET MY FATHER
KNOW ABOUT THAT.


459
00:21:03.706 --> 00:21:05.410
HE'S SO EXCITED
ABOUT THE NEW BUSINESS


460
00:21:05.444 --> 00:21:07.047
THAT I WOULD HATE
FOR HIM TO THINK


461
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.816
THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.

462
00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:10.720
YOU MEAN US.

463
00:21:10.754 --> 00:21:11.422
I MEAN, HER.

464
00:21:11.456 --> 00:21:13.793
LET'S JUST CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

465
00:21:13.826 --> 00:21:15.029
DID YOU HEAR THAT THE TICKETS

466
00:21:15.063 --> 00:21:16.799
GO ON SALE FOR THE DANCE FRIDAY?

467
00:21:16.832 --> 00:21:18.035
YOU GUYS GOING?

468
00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:19.104
I'M NOT.

469
00:21:19.137 --> 00:21:21.075
WHY NOT? YOU HAVE TO.

470
00:21:21.108 --> 00:21:22.678
IT'S THE DEEP BLUE SEA DANCE.

471
00:21:22.711 --> 00:21:24.648
BUT I DON'T HAVE A DATE.

472
00:21:24.682 --> 00:21:25.617
OR A SNORKEL.

473
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.087
WELL, NONE OF US DO.

474
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.855
I HAVE A SNORKEL.

475
00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:30.895
WELL, SINCE NONE OF US
HAVE DATES,


476
00:21:30.928 --> 00:21:31.973
WHY DON'T WE GO AS A GROUP?

477
00:21:31.997 --> 00:21:33.099
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

478
00:21:33.132 --> 00:21:34.134
I GUESS IT COULD BE FUN.

479
00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:36.806
AND I CAN GET MY BROTHER
TO DRIVE US IN HIS TRUCK.


480
00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:38.151
YEAH. THAT WOULD BE
SO MUCH COOLER


481
00:21:38.175 --> 00:21:40.680
THAN PULLING UP
IN MY DAD'S PIZZA TRUCK.


482
00:21:40.714 --> 00:21:42.751
THEN IT'S A DATE.

483
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:52.137
VOLUNTEERS NEEDED
FOR THIS YEAR'S
DANCE COMMITTEE.


484
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.078
OH, HEY, JAMIE, 
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

485
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:57.013
YOU GUYS,

486
00:21:57.047 --> 00:21:58.750
WE SHOULD DO IT.

487
00:21:58.783 --> 00:21:59.585
GOOD IDEA.

488
00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:00.763
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
ONE OF THE POPULARS,


489
00:22:00.787 --> 00:22:02.290
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ACT LIKE IT.

490
00:22:02.323 --> 00:22:03.994
WE HAVE TO.

491
00:22:04.027 --> 00:22:07.100
HARMONY, YOU ARE SUCH
A GREAT ARTIST.


492
00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:09.304
AND LINDSAY, NOBODY CAN
ORGANIZE THE TROOPS


493
00:22:09.337 --> 00:22:10.273
LIKE YOU CAN.

494
00:22:10.306 --> 00:22:11.542
YOU GUYS, WE COULD REALLY ROCK

495
00:22:11.576 --> 00:22:13.112
THE DECORATING COMMITTEE APART.

496
00:22:13.145 --> 00:22:15.149
I DON'T KNOW,
I WAS GONNA
MOBILIZE A PROTEST


497
00:22:15.183 --> 00:22:17.754
AGAINST
THE MAKE-UP COMPANY
AT THE MALL.


498
00:22:17.788 --> 00:22:19.091
WELL, WE CAN DO BOTH.

499
00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:21.729
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
A BIG WASTE OF TIME.


500
00:22:21.762 --> 00:22:23.833
WHATEVER, VAN GOGH.

501
00:22:23.867 --> 00:22:25.837
IT'LL BE LOTS OF FUN, I PROMISE.

502
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:28.009
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

503
00:22:53.225 --> 00:22:54.828
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

504
00:22:54.863 --> 00:22:58.169
RALPH, THIS IS DIANA.

505
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:00.807
HELLO. HI.

506
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.043
I'M YOUR DAUGHTER'S HANDLER.

507
00:23:02.077 --> 00:23:04.147
WHAT DOES JAMIE NEED
A HANDLER FOR?


508
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:05.684
GOOD QUESTION, DAD.

509
00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:08.222
JUST TO HELP HER
OVER THE ROUGH SPOTS.


510
00:23:08.255 --> 00:23:09.057
ALL RIGHT, HAIR, UP.

511
00:23:09.091 --> 00:23:11.228
THE PINKS, BRIGHTER.
LOSE THE SNEAKERS.


512
00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:13.733
THIS ISN'T
A BASKETBALL GAME
WE'RE GOING TO.


513
00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:17.909
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
ABOUT THOSE CHEEKS?


514
00:23:17.942 --> 00:23:19.712
OW!

515
00:23:19.745 --> 00:23:20.479
PERFECT.

516
00:23:20.513 --> 00:23:23.085
UM, IS ALL THIS
REALLY NECESSARY?


517
00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:24.856
NO, HE DIDN'T.

518
00:23:25.189 --> 00:23:27.895
UH, WHAT MY HUSBAND
IS TRYING TO SAY


519
00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:30.133
IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE
A LOT OF EFFORT,


520
00:23:30.166 --> 00:23:33.907
AND PINCHING,
JUST FOR AN INTERVIEW.


521
00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:36.111
NOT JUST AN INTERVIEW.

522
00:23:36.145 --> 00:23:37.147
IT'S MAURA LIVE.

523
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.219
MRS. BARTLETT,
MAY I CALL YOU PEGGY?


524
00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:41.188
SURE.

525
00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:42.190
PEGGY, SCHILLING PRESS
HAS SPENT A LOT OF MONEY


526
00:23:42.223 --> 00:23:45.096
TO GET YOUR DAUGHTER'S BOOK
ON THE TOP 10 LIST.


527
00:23:45.129 --> 00:23:48.871
WE THINK YOU CAN PUT UP
WITH A LITTLE DISCOMFORT.


528
00:23:48.904 --> 00:23:50.740
HMM? RIGHT, JAMESON?

529
00:23:50.774 --> 00:23:52.243
IT'S JAMIE.

530
00:23:52.277 --> 00:23:54.347
LOVELY CHILD.

531
00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:58.489
I AM NOT DRIVING YOU
TO THE DANCE.


532
00:23:58.522 --> 00:23:59.792
STOP BEGGING.

533
00:23:59.825 --> 00:24:00.493
PLEASE.

534
00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:01.897
LOOK, WHY CAN'T DAD TAKE YOU?

535
00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.432
BECAUSE HE'S NOT COOL.

536
00:24:03.465 --> 00:24:05.303
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

537
00:24:05.336 --> 00:24:06.238
BUT NO.

538
00:24:06.271 --> 00:24:08.342
IF YOU WON'T
DO IT FOR ME,
DO IT FOR JAMIE.


539
00:24:08.375 --> 00:24:12.217
YOU'RE TAKING JAMIE BARTLETT
TO THE DANCE?


540
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:12.952
WAY TO GO, SQUIRT.

541
00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:16.325
WELL, IT'S KIND OF
A GROUP THING.


542
00:24:16.358 --> 00:24:17.493
IT'S A START.

543
00:24:17.527 --> 00:24:19.031
SO YOU'LL DO IT?

544
00:24:19.064 --> 00:24:19.798
NO.

545
00:24:19.832 --> 00:24:21.501
PLEASE. I'LL DO
ANYTHING YOU WANT.


546
00:24:21.535 --> 00:24:22.237
I'LL WASH YOUR CAR.

547
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.343
DO YOUR LAUNDRY.
CLEAN YOUR ROOM.


548
00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:26.211
AND THE IGUANA TANKS?

549
00:24:26.245 --> 00:24:30.119
AND? I WAS JUST TALKING
ABOUT ONE CHORE.


550
00:24:30.153 --> 00:24:31.221
WELL, YOU KNOW, I GUESS

551
00:24:31.255 --> 00:24:33.225
YOU DON'T NEED A RIDE
THAT BADLY, SO...


552
00:24:33.259 --> 00:24:35.796
OK, DEAL. SWEET.

553
00:24:41.977 --> 00:24:42.577
THANKS.

554
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.314
I'M GONNA GO.

555
00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:48.155
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN, JAMIE.


556
00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:50.159
YEAH. BUT IT WOULD BE MORE FUN

557
00:24:50.193 --> 00:24:52.030
IF THE TWO OF YOU
WERE COMING ALONG.


558
00:24:52.063 --> 00:24:53.565
WE WISH.

559
00:24:57.007 --> 00:24:58.385
SOMEHOW I THINK ALL
THE PARTIES AND CAVIAR


560
00:24:58.409 --> 00:24:59.344
WILL MAKE UP FOR IT.

561
00:24:59.377 --> 00:25:01.348
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'LL BE ROUGH,

562
00:25:01.381 --> 00:25:05.289
BUT LET'S FACE IT,
SOMEONE HAS TO DO IT.


563
00:25:06.691 --> 00:25:09.164
LENNY SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

564
00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:14.875
HE'S AWESOME.

565
00:25:18.315 --> 00:25:21.255
YEAH. TOO BAD HE WON'T
PLAY ANYWHERE ELSE


566
00:25:21.288 --> 00:25:22.257
BESIDES HIS BEDROOM.

567
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.359
HE'S SUCH A DORK

568
00:25:23.392 --> 00:25:24.261
WHEN IT COMES TO HIS MUSIC.

569
00:25:24.294 --> 00:25:26.198
HE SHOULD PLAY AT THE DANCE.

570
00:25:26.231 --> 00:25:27.467
HE SHOULD ALSO WASH HIS HANDS

571
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.271
MORE OFTEN THAN HE DOES
BUT I DON'T THINK


572
00:25:29.304 --> 00:25:31.075
WE'RE GONNA GET HIM
TO DO IT EITHER.


573
00:25:31.108 --> 00:25:33.012
COME ON.

574
00:25:40.493 --> 00:25:42.530
COME ON, PEOPLE.
WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.


575
00:25:42.563 --> 00:25:45.036
WE HAVE A SCHEDULE TO KEEP.

576
00:25:45.069 --> 00:25:48.309
WELL, YOU HEARD HER.
WE SHOULD BE GOING.


577
00:25:48.342 --> 00:25:49.377
BYE, DADDY.

578
00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:51.348
BYE, JAMIE.

579
00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:54.687
LENNY.

580
00:25:54.721 --> 00:25:58.729
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO YOUR SISTER?


581
00:25:58.762 --> 00:26:00.633
JAMIE.

582
00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:02.437
LENNY.

583
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.474
OK. THANKS FOR TRYING.

584
00:26:05.409 --> 00:26:09.017
TEMPEST FUGET. 
TEMPEST FUGET.

585
00:26:09.584 --> 00:26:11.188
BYE, DADDY.

586
00:26:12.423 --> 00:26:13.325
BETTER GO.

587
00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:15.329
BYE. BYE BYE.

588
00:26:16.198 --> 00:26:18.035
CHOTSY ON THE WINDOW SEAT.

589
00:26:18.069 --> 00:26:21.475

JAMMING?

OH, NO, MOM.

DON'T SAY THAT OUT LOUD AGAIN.

642
00:28:21.315 --> 00:28:24.587
SOMEONE MIGHT HEAR YOU
AND THINK YOU'RE HERE
WITH ME.


643
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:25.823
YOUNG LADY.

644
00:28:25.857 --> 00:28:27.727
WHAT? I'M SORRY.

645
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.629
BUT JAMMING?

646
00:28:28.662 --> 00:28:29.597
DIDN'T YOUR GENERATION

00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:38.315
I'VE GOT SOME BUSINESS
TO TAKE CARE OF


651
00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:39.317
OVER BY THE SHRIMP PLATE.

652
00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:42.390
SO YOU TWO HELP YOURSELVES
TO WHATEVER YOU WANT,


653
00:28:42.423 --> 00:28:43.592
AND HAVE FUN.

654
00:28:43.625 --> 00:28:44.627
THAT'S AN ORDER.

655
00:28:44.661 --> 00:28:47.633
OH, HEY. YEAH.

656
00:28:50.606 --> 00:28:51.508
IT'S AMBER TIFFANY.

657
00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:52.810
DON'T YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF HER

658
00:28:52.843 --> 00:28:53.645
HANGING ON YOUR BEDROOM WALL?

659
00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:56.050
NO. THAT'S A PICTURE
OF RYDER DONOVAN.


660
00:28:56.084 --> 00:28:58.956
AMBER'S JUST STANDING
NEXT TO HIM.


661
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.659
SHOULD WE GO SAY HI?

662
00:29:00.693 --> 00:29:01.461
NO!

663
00:29:01.495 --> 00:29:03.399
YOU CAN'T JUST GO UP
AND TALK TO HER.


664
00:29:03.432 --> 00:29:04.868
SHE'S AMBER TIFFANY.

665
00:29:04.902 --> 00:29:06.638
SHE'S ON TELEVISION.

666
00:29:06.671 --> 00:29:08.375
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES I THINK
THAT YOU'RE FROM


667
00:29:08.409 --> 00:29:09.377
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
PLANET, MOTHER.


668
00:29:09.411 --> 00:29:12.717
JAMIE, THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE
JUST LIKE YOU AND ME.


669
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.654
OH, MY GOD!

670
00:29:14.687 --> 00:29:16.591
IT'S GEORGE JACKSON.

671
00:29:16.625 --> 00:29:18.762
I HAVE ALL OF HIS ALBUMS.

672
00:29:18.795 --> 00:29:20.499
UH, YEAH, WHAT'S AN ALBUM?

673
00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:23.572
SOMETHING WE LISTEN TO
ON THE PLANET I'M FROM.


674
00:29:23.605 --> 00:29:26.545
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO
TALK TO HIM.


675
00:29:26.578 --> 00:29:27.881
HE'S JUST PEOPLE.

676
00:29:27.914 --> 00:29:30.586
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M GOING TO.

677
00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:32.557
GEORGE. GEORGE JACKSON!

678
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.193
NO. MOTHER, I WAS JUST...

679
00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:36.097
HI. I LOVE YOU.

680
00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.700
I AM SO EXCITED.

681
00:29:37.733 --> 00:29:39.637
KIDDING.

682
00:29:47.052 --> 00:29:48.522
SO...

683
00:29:48.555 --> 00:29:49.423
GO MINGLE.

684
00:29:49.457 --> 00:29:52.730
THERE MUST BE SOMEONE HERE
YOU CAN TALK TO.


685
00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:56.505
OHH... HI, THERE, LITTLE FELLA.

686
00:29:56.538 --> 00:30:00.713
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.


687
00:30:00.746 --> 00:30:02.016
PUPPY!

688
00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:04.587
OW! OW! OW!

689
00:30:04.621 --> 00:30:05.489
MY HAIR. OH...

690
00:30:05.523 --> 00:30:06.567
THIS COULD ONLY HAPPEN TO ME.

691
00:30:06.591 --> 00:30:08.562
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
THIS COULD'VE...


692
00:30:08.595 --> 00:30:10.499
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

693
00:30:10.533 --> 00:30:12.069
FOLLOW ME TO THE GREEN ROOM

694
00:30:12.102 --> 00:30:15.609
BEFORE I END UP ON
THE COVER OF STARLET.


695
00:30:15.643 --> 00:30:16.578
OH...

696
00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:17.680
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

697
00:30:17.713 --> 00:30:19.784
I'M REALLY SORRY. OW!

698
00:30:22.056 --> 00:30:23.158
OW, OW, OW, OW!

699
00:30:23.191 --> 00:30:27.132
I'M REALLY SORRY.

700
00:30:28.234 --> 00:30:29.771
I GOT IT.

701
00:30:29.804 --> 00:30:31.507
FINALLY.

702
00:30:31.808 --> 00:30:34.213
ARE YOU GONNA LET HER
TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT?


703
00:30:34.246 --> 00:30:35.816
SAY SOMETHING.

704
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.691
HI. I'M JAMIE BARTLETT.

705
00:30:39.724 --> 00:30:40.626
HI.

706
00:30:40.659 --> 00:30:43.732
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?

707
00:30:43.765 --> 00:30:45.135
YOUR TIARA LOOKS REALLY NICE.

708
00:30:45.168 --> 00:30:47.974
YEAH. IT SHOULD BE.
IT COST ENOUGH.


709
00:30:48.008 --> 00:30:50.779
JAMESON BARTLETT?

710
00:30:52.282 --> 00:30:55.088
YOU'RE JAMESON BARTLETT, RIGHT?

711
00:30:55.122 --> 00:30:55.756
YEAH.

712
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:59.163
ZAP, ZAP. I LOVED YOUR BOOK.

713
00:30:59.196 --> 00:31:00.132
LOVED IT.

714
00:31:00.165 --> 00:31:01.234
YOU WROTE A BOOK?

715
00:31:01.267 --> 00:31:02.002
OH, IT'S FANTASTIC.

716
00:31:02.036 --> 00:31:04.140
I READ IT BETWEEN SCENES
LAST WEEK.


717
00:31:04.173 --> 00:31:06.144
SO, HOW'S THE TOUR COMING?

718
00:31:06.177 --> 00:31:07.948
I JUST SAW YOU ON MAURA LIVE.

719
00:31:07.981 --> 00:31:08.950
AND THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,

720
00:31:08.983 --> 00:31:11.821
YOU WERE POISONING
STEFFIE CHANDLER'S
LEMONADE.


721
00:31:11.856 --> 00:31:14.862
DON'T WORRY.
I ONLY PLAY EVIL ON TV.


722
00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:18.034
CADYN, YOU'RE IN MY LIGHT.

723
00:31:20.038 --> 00:31:23.278
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER MYRNA.

724
00:31:31.795 --> 00:31:33.799
WILL THE HUMILIATION NEVER END?

725
00:31:33.832 --> 00:31:36.872
I'M SORRY. WERE YOU
TALKING TO ME?


726
00:31:36.906 --> 00:31:39.043
YOU'RE RYDER DONOVAN.

727
00:31:39.076 --> 00:31:40.679
YOU'RE JAMESON BARTLETT.

728
00:31:40.713 --> 00:31:42.082
CALL ME JAMIE.

729
00:31:42.116 --> 00:31:45.088
OK, JAMIE. I'M A BIG FAN.

730
00:31:45.122 --> 00:31:47.994
NO WAY!

731
00:31:48.028 --> 00:31:48.695
A BIG FAN?

732
00:31:48.729 --> 00:31:50.098
WE WANT TO HEAR EVERY DETAIL.

733
00:31:50.132 --> 00:31:51.267
I NEED SOME HELP BACK HERE.

734
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.914
IT'S ON AGAIN.
WE'RE WATCHING IT RIGHT NOW.


735
00:31:52.938 --> 00:31:54.406
GIRLS! IT'S JAMIE.

736
00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.008
OH!

737
00:31:55.042 --> 00:31:56.444
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO TELL.

738
00:31:56.477 --> 00:31:58.214
THEN HIS HANDLER INTERRUPTED,

739
00:31:58.248 --> 00:31:59.751
AND THEN MY HANDLER INTERRUPTED.

740
00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.922
AND THEN THE HANDLERS
STARTED HARASSING US.


741
00:32:01.956 --> 00:32:03.091
IT WASN'T PRETTY.

742
00:32:03.124 --> 00:32:05.128
WELL, AT LEAST
HE KNOWS
YOU'RE ALIVE.


743
00:32:05.162 --> 00:32:06.330
ANYONE ELSE?

744
00:32:06.364 --> 00:32:07.868
AMBER TIFFANY WAS THERE.

745
00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:09.203
GET OUT! GET OUT!

746
00:32:09.236 --> 00:32:10.272
SO NOT IMPRESSIVE.

747
00:32:10.305 --> 00:32:11.316
SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE DECORATING
COMMITTEE?


748
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.913
I FEEL REALLY BAD
THAT I'M NOT THERE
TO HELP OUT.


749
00:32:13.946 --> 00:32:16.417
DON'T WORRY. THERE'LL BE
PLENTY TO DO
WHEN YOU GET BACK.


750
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.090
YOU HAVE TO SEE HARMONY'S WHALE.

751
00:32:19.123 --> 00:32:20.292
IT'S AMAZING.

752
00:32:20.325 --> 00:32:20.927
WELL, IT'S OK.

753
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.864
BUT YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GUESS

754
00:32:22.898 --> 00:32:25.335
WHAT HAPPENED AT SCHOOL
ON FRIDAY.


755
00:32:25.368 --> 00:32:26.838
WHAT? GUESS.

756
00:32:26.872 --> 00:32:27.506
TELL ME!

757
00:32:27.539 --> 00:32:29.276
SAWYER AND MARCO BROKE UP.

758
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.212
GET OUT!

759
00:32:30.245 --> 00:32:32.016
THEY HAD A HUGE... DRAMATIC.

760
00:32:32.049 --> 00:32:33.318
BREAK UP RIGHT AFTER LUNCH.

761
00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:34.153
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

762
00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:36.557
SHE TOLD HIM THAT HE
DIDN'T TREAT HER...


763
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.928
THE WAY SHE SHOULD BE TREATED.

764
00:32:37.961 --> 00:32:40.398
AND HE SAID SHE WAS
A SPOILED BRAT.


765
00:32:40.432 --> 00:32:41.300
WHOA!

766
00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:42.369
I KNOW, RIGHT?

767
00:32:42.402 --> 00:32:46.310
WELL, SOMEONE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.


768
00:32:46.344 --> 00:32:48.281
THANK YOU. HEY.

769
00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:49.516
JAMIE, HONEY.

770
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.987
THERE ARE A FEW TALKING POINTS

771
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.061
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO COVER

772
00:32:52.089 --> 00:32:54.393
BEFORE YOUR NEXT INTERVIEW, OK?

773
00:32:54.426 --> 00:32:55.964
SORRY, GUYS. I HAVE TO GO.

774
00:32:55.997 --> 00:32:56.797
THAT'S MY HANDLER.

775
00:32:56.831 --> 00:33:00.205
BUT I'LL TALK
TO YOU GUYS LATER. BYE.


776
00:33:17.506 --> 00:33:18.943
OH, NOT MORE LAUNDRY.

777
00:33:18.976 --> 00:33:21.514
YOU STILL NEED A RIDE,
DON'T YOU?


778
00:33:22.082 --> 00:33:24.153
PUT IT IN THE PILE.

779
00:33:24.186 --> 00:33:25.622
GOOD JOB, SQUIRT.

780
00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:27.894
AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD'VE
QUIT WEEKS AGO.


781
00:33:27.928 --> 00:33:29.864
NOT A CHANCE.

782
00:33:31.936 --> 00:33:33.973
MUST REALLY LIKE HER.

783
00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:41.054
LET'S GO, HONEY.

784
00:33:41.087 --> 00:33:42.924
CHOP, CHOP.
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.


785
00:33:42.958 --> 00:33:45.964
ALMOST DONE.

786
00:33:45.997 --> 00:33:47.699
TURN OFF THE TABLET. NOW.

787
00:33:47.732 --> 00:33:48.701
I DON'T GET IT.

788
00:33:48.734 --> 00:33:50.974
FIRST YOU TELL ME TO WRITE,
THEN YOU SAY DON'T.


789
00:33:51.007 --> 00:33:52.978
I'M GETTING MIXED SIGNALS
HERE, MOTHER.


790
00:33:53.011 --> 00:33:55.950
NO. WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
IS FRESH.


791
00:33:55.984 --> 00:33:57.019
GET IN THE CAR.

792
00:33:57.052 --> 00:34:00.092
HONEY, COME ON LET'S GO.

793
00:34:10.545 --> 00:34:12.616
SAW YOU ON TV.
YOU ROCKED, BARTLETT.


794
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:14.020
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

795
00:34:14.053 --> 00:34:14.988
HEY, CUTIE.

796
00:34:15.022 --> 00:34:17.159
HI! HI!

797
00:34:17.192 --> 00:34:18.161
HI!

798
00:34:18.194 --> 00:34:19.463
HI, JAMIE!

799
00:34:19.496 --> 00:34:21.167
HI, JAMIE.

800
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.769
HELLO.

801
00:34:22.802 --> 00:34:24.306
HEY, JAMIE.

802
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.542
HEY.

803
00:34:25.575 --> 00:34:29.050
SO, DID YOU REALLY
MEET AMBER TIFFANY?


804
00:34:29.083 --> 00:34:31.754
YEAH. WE'RE KIND OF FRIENDS.

805
00:34:31.787 --> 00:34:33.658
NO WAY.

806
00:34:33.691 --> 00:34:35.428
WAY.

807
00:34:35.462 --> 00:34:37.332
WOW. YOU'RE A SUPERSTAR NOW.

808
00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:39.103
SO WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT

809
00:34:39.136 --> 00:34:39.971
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE

810
00:34:40.004 --> 00:34:42.142
AT OUR ANIMAL RIGHTS
RALLY NEXT THURSDAY.


811
00:34:42.176 --> 00:34:43.211
YOU ARE COMING, RIGHT?

812
00:34:43.244 --> 00:34:44.146
OF COURSE I'M COMING.

813
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.724
I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.


814
00:34:45.748 --> 00:34:48.221
I WOULD NEVER LET YOU GUYS DOWN.

815
00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:49.723
OR THE BUGS.

816
00:34:49.756 --> 00:34:51.660
COME ON.

817
00:34:55.135 --> 00:34:57.139
WHOA. WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

818
00:34:57.172 --> 00:34:59.843
OH, THE FRESH PINE SCENT?

819
00:34:59.877 --> 00:35:00.578
THAT'S ME.

820
00:35:00.612 --> 00:35:03.118
I HAD TO DETAIL MY BROTHER'S CAR

821
00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:03.818
BEFORE SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

822
00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:04.854
IT'S PART OF OUR DEAL.

823
00:35:04.887 --> 00:35:07.092
SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF WORK
JUST FOR SOME WHEELS.


824
00:35:07.126 --> 00:35:08.328
YEAH. BUT WORTH IT.

825
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:09.864
CONNOR, THAT IS SO NICE

826
00:35:09.897 --> 00:35:12.136
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR...

827
00:35:20.252 --> 00:35:20.919
DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?

828
00:35:20.953 --> 00:35:23.324
YOU TWO TOTALLY HAD A MOMENT.

829
00:35:23.358 --> 00:35:24.326
DID WE?

830
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.695
YEAH. WE DID.

831
00:35:25.728 --> 00:35:27.132
HEY, JAMIE.

832
00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:29.203
WE HAVE AN EXTRA SEAT.

833
00:35:29.236 --> 00:35:31.240
JENNIFER TOO'S OUT SICK.

834
00:35:31.274 --> 00:35:33.344
NO, THANKS.

835
00:35:33.378 --> 00:35:34.646
OH, COME ON WE WANT TO HEAR

836
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.851
ALL ABOUT THE BACKSTAGE PARTY.

837
00:35:37.953 --> 00:35:40.158
GO AHEAD. GIVE THEM A TREAT.

838
00:35:40.192 --> 00:35:43.264
WE'VE ALREADY HEARD
ALL THE STORIES.


839
00:35:47.873 --> 00:35:49.310
THAT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH PRODDING.

840
00:35:49.343 --> 00:35:50.578
LET'S FACE IT, CONNOR.

841
00:35:50.612 --> 00:35:51.814
WE HAVE TO SHARE OUR JAMIE

842
00:35:51.847 --> 00:35:52.816
WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD NOW.

843
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.620
JUST AS LONG AS SHE CAN FILL UP

844
00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:55.688
MY ANIMAL RIGHTS RALLY

845
00:35:55.722 --> 00:35:57.426
LIKE SHE CAN FILL UP
A PIZZA PARLOR,


846
00:35:57.459 --> 00:35:59.864
I THINK I CAN DEAL WITH IT.

847
00:36:02.836 --> 00:36:04.473
AND THEN WHEN I STOOD UP,

848
00:36:04.506 --> 00:36:06.878
MY HAIR WAS STUCK IN HER TIARA.

849
00:36:06.911 --> 00:36:08.348
NO WAY!

850
00:36:08.381 --> 00:36:08.982
WAY!

851
00:36:09.015 --> 00:36:09.984
WHAT DID YOU DO?

852
00:36:10.017 --> 00:36:10.953
WELL, WE DIDN'T WANT TO END UP

853
00:36:10.986 --> 00:36:13.658
ON THE COVER
OF STARLE NOW, DID WE?


854
00:36:13.691 --> 00:36:15.863
NO. SO WE SCURRIED OFF
TO THE GREEN ROOM


855
00:36:15.896 --> 00:36:16.907
BEFORE ANYBODY COULD SEE US.

856
00:36:16.931 --> 00:36:19.002
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE?

857
00:36:19.035 --> 00:36:20.906
THAT IS FUNNY.

858
00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:28.588
NOW THAT HE'S SINGLE,

859
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:31.494
YOU THINK MARCO WILL TAKE
JAMIE TO THE DANCE?


860
00:36:31.527 --> 00:36:32.596
THEY COULDN'T.

861
00:36:32.629 --> 00:36:34.533
WHY NOT? HE'S A FREE MAN NOW.

862
00:36:34.566 --> 00:36:35.945
BECAUSE SHE SAID
SHE WAS GOING WITH US.


863
00:36:35.969 --> 00:36:37.706
WE'RE GOING AS A GROUP.

864
00:36:37.739 --> 00:36:38.674
I THINK THE RULE WAS

865
00:36:38.708 --> 00:36:40.678
IF NO ONE
ASKED US FIRST
WE'D GO AS A GROUP.


866
00:36:40.712 --> 00:36:41.847
WHAT? THAT WASN'T A RULE.

867
00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:42.926
WHEN DID WE MAKE THAT RULE?

868
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.028
WHY? DO YOU KNOW ANYONE ELSE

869
00:36:44.052 --> 00:36:46.390
WHO MIGHT WANT TO
TAKE HER TO THE DANCE?


870
00:36:46.424 --> 00:36:46.958
NO.

871
00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:47.927
SOUNDS LIKE YOU DO.

872
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.995
I DON'T. I JUST...

873
00:36:49.029 --> 00:36:50.899
DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A RULE.

874
00:36:50.933 --> 00:36:52.970
WHATEVER.

875
00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:02.722
SO, HOW WAS LUNCH
WITH THE POPULARS?


876
00:37:02.756 --> 00:37:04.894
WELL, IT WASN'T EXCRUCIATING.

877
00:37:04.927 --> 00:37:07.031
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU
WERE HAVING FUN.


878
00:37:07.065 --> 00:37:08.568
I WOULDN'T CALL IT FUN.

879
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:09.470
I MEAN, IT WAS OK.

880
00:37:09.503 --> 00:37:11.115
NOT LIKE HANGING OUT
WITH YOU GUYS, THOUGH.


881
00:37:11.139 --> 00:37:12.108
AND THE LONGER I SAT THERE,

882
00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:14.914
THE MORE I COULD
FEEL MYSELF
LOSING IQ POINTS.


883
00:37:15.983 --> 00:37:17.018
HEY, WHY DIDN'T CONNOR

884
00:37:17.051 --> 00:37:18.488
WANT TO COME WITH US TODAY?

885
00:37:18.521 --> 00:37:19.690
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

886
00:37:19.723 --> 00:37:21.460
HE'S BEEN ACTING
ALL BOY-LIKE LATELY.


887
00:37:21.494 --> 00:37:24.533
WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU
AT THE PIZZA PARLOR.


888
00:37:24.566 --> 00:37:25.936
OH, UH...

889
00:37:25.969 --> 00:37:26.938
YOU WON'T SEE ME.

890
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:28.374
WE WON'T?

891
00:37:28.408 --> 00:37:29.376
NO.

892
00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.913
I QUIT.

893
00:37:31.514 --> 00:37:32.917
DIDN'T WE COVER THIS?

894
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.956
I THOUGHT MY HANDLER
CALLED YOU GUYS.


895
00:37:35.989 --> 00:37:37.158
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

896
00:37:37.191 --> 00:37:40.064
NO. I'M JOKING.

897
00:37:41.099 --> 00:37:42.602
WELL, MAYBE IT'S THE TRUTH.

898
00:37:42.636 --> 00:37:45.808
I THOUGHT I TOLD SOMEONE.

899
00:37:45.842 --> 00:37:47.579
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

900
00:37:47.612 --> 00:37:50.685
IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED
THE MONEY ANYMORE.


901
00:37:50.718 --> 00:37:52.388
BYE BYE.

902
00:38:13.564 --> 00:38:14.666
PRUNE PIZZA, PEG.

903
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.136
HONEY, NO.

904
00:38:16.169 --> 00:38:18.140
TRY IT.

905
00:38:18.173 --> 00:38:20.211
DON'T JUDGE IT SO HARSHLY.

906
00:38:20.244 --> 00:38:20.946
NO.

907
00:38:20.979 --> 00:38:21.881
YOU KNOW, I BET THE FIRST PERSON

908
00:38:21.915 --> 00:38:24.653
TO TRY A PINEAPPLE PIZZA
WAS LAUGHED AT, TOO.


909
00:38:24.686 --> 00:38:27.125
BESIDES, IT'S MORE
OF A BREAKFAST PIZZA.


910
00:38:27.158 --> 00:38:29.730
YOU KNOW,
MY GOURMET PIES
ARE DOING SO WELL


911
00:38:29.763 --> 00:38:31.834
I WAS THINKING WE SHOULD
OPEN FOR BREAKFAST.


912
00:38:31.868 --> 00:38:34.039
OH, RALPH. DON'
T DO THIS TO US.

913
00:38:34.072 --> 00:38:34.673
THINGS ARE GOING GREAT.

914
00:38:34.706 --> 00:38:37.078
IT'S THE POWER OF MY PIZZA.

915
00:38:37.111 --> 00:38:38.581
MM
-HMM.

916
00:38:38.614 --> 00:38:40.785
RALPH'S PIZZA SHACK.

917
00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:45.562
YES. THIS IS THE PLACE
RIGHT OUT OF
"IS SAVES THE WORLD."


918
00:38:45.595 --> 00:38:48.568
BIRTHDAY RESERVATIONS.

919
00:38:48.601 --> 00:38:50.538
FOR 12.

920
00:38:50.572 --> 00:38:53.578
I HAVE IT. THANK YOU.

921
00:38:53.611 --> 00:38:56.617
MAYBE IT'S NOT ONLY MY PIZZA.

922
00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.220
MAYBE.

923
00:38:58.889 --> 00:39:00.157
MAYBE.

924
00:39:10.712 --> 00:39:12.649
HEY, LINDS. HOW WAS WORK?

925
00:39:12.682 --> 00:39:13.417
EXHAUSTING.

926
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.254
WHO KNEW PIZZAS
COULD BE SO HEAVY?


927
00:39:15.287 --> 00:39:16.356
YOU THINK YOU'RE TIRED?

928
00:39:16.389 --> 00:39:19.931
YOU'D NEVER BELIEVE
ALL THE STUFF
I'VE GOT GOING ON.


929
00:39:19.964 --> 00:39:21.166
IT'S CRAZY.

930
00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:22.970
YEAH, WELL, I WAS CALLING TO SEE

931
00:39:23.003 --> 00:39:24.215
IF YOU CAN HELP OUT ON SATURDAY.

932
00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:27.011
WE HAVE TO FINISH
HARMONY'S WHALE BY NEXT WEEK.


933
00:39:27.045 --> 00:39:28.748
WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO THAT?

934
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:32.756
HELLO. WE'RE ALL ON
THE DECORATING COMMITTEE
REMEMBER?


935
00:39:32.789 --> 00:39:34.068
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GOT US INTO THIS.


936
00:39:34.092 --> 00:39:37.900
RIGHT. UM... LOOK,
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T.


937
00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:41.006
DIANA'S COMING OVER
TO HELP ME
ANSWER FAN MAIL.


938
00:39:41.039 --> 00:39:41.975
YOU HAVE FAN MAIL?

939
00:39:42.008 --> 00:39:45.916
WELL... IT'S FOR IS,
BUT I HAVE TO
ANSWER IT.


940
00:39:45.949 --> 00:39:47.085
OH.

941
00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:48.187
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FORGET

942
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.122
ABOUT MY ANIMAL RIGHTS
RALLY, ARE YOU?


943
00:39:49.155 --> 00:39:51.827
WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP
TO GET THE WORD OUT.


944
00:39:54.265 --> 00:39:55.167
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

945
00:39:55.201 --> 00:39:57.940
A DIRECT CONNECTION
TO HIGH SCHOOL ROYALTY.


946
00:39:57.973 --> 00:40:00.144
UM, I HAVE TO TAKE THIS CALL,

947
00:40:00.177 --> 00:40:02.015
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I'LL BE AT THAT RALLY.


948
00:40:02.048 --> 00:40:04.219
CALL ME TOMORROW.

949
00:40:07.225 --> 00:40:08.093
HELLO?

950
00:40:08.127 --> 00:40:10.765
JAMIE. HEY, IT'S SAWYER.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?


951
00:40:10.798 --> 00:40:12.702
OH... NOTHING.

952
00:40:12.736 --> 00:40:15.341
HEY, LISTEN,
YOU WANT TO HIT
THE MALL ON SATURDAY?


953
00:40:15.374 --> 00:40:17.078
SURE. I'D LOVE TO.

954
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:19.851
SWEET. CAN'T WAIT.

955
00:40:22.188 --> 00:40:24.159
YES!

956
00:40:33.243 --> 00:40:34.813
THANK YOU.

957
00:40:39.122 --> 00:40:41.093
HEY.

958
00:40:41.827 --> 00:40:42.997
MARCO.

959
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.065
IS JAMIE HERE?

960
00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:45.234
ONLY IN SPIRIT.

961
00:40:45.267 --> 00:40:48.107
WILL YOU TELL HER
THAT I'M LOOKING FOR HER.


962
00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.144
NO.

963
00:40:50.177 --> 00:40:50.979
EXCUSE ME?

964
00:40:51.013 --> 00:40:53.050
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T
WORK HERE ANYMORE.


965
00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.328
YEAH, BUT YOU GUYS
ARE FRIENDS, RIGHT?


966
00:40:54.352 --> 00:40:55.187
HEY, DO YOU KNOW

967
00:40:55.221 --> 00:40:57.893
IF SHE'S GOING
TO THE DANCE
WITH ANYONE?


968
00:40:57.927 --> 00:40:59.129
I DON'T KNOW.

969
00:40:59.162 --> 00:41:02.468
BUT IF I SEE HER,
I'LL LET HER KNOW
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HER.


970
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:05.074
THANKS.

971
00:41:05.107 --> 00:41:06.776
NO PROBLEM.

972
00:41:10.284 --> 00:41:12.990
WHO KNEW BEING AN AUTHOR
WOULD BE SUCH HARD WORK?


973
00:41:13.023 --> 00:41:14.525
WELL, YOU BETTER
GET USED TO IT,
JAMIE.


974
00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:17.198
IF YOUR NEXT BOOK
SELLS EVERYTHING
LIKE THIS ONE,


975
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:18.309
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

976
00:41:18.333 --> 00:41:20.337
HEY, WHO WANTS A BITE TO EAT?

977
00:41:20.371 --> 00:41:21.306
ME. I'M STARVING.

978
00:41:21.339 --> 00:41:24.812
ME THREE.
LET'S CHARGE IT
TO THE PUBLISHER.


979
00:41:33.397 --> 00:41:34.532
YOU KNOW WHAT...

980
00:41:34.565 --> 00:41:36.938
I'M NOT HUNGRY ANYMORE.

981
00:41:36.971 --> 00:41:38.540
CAN WE KEEP WALKING?

982
00:41:44.619 --> 00:41:45.554
HEY, CHECK IT OUT, BRO.

983
00:41:45.587 --> 00:41:47.391
WAIT TILL JAMIE SEES THESE, HUH?

984
00:41:47.425 --> 00:41:50.264
DOUBT IF SHE EVER WILL.

985
00:41:50.297 --> 00:41:52.401
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

986
00:41:52.435 --> 00:41:56.176
WELL, MARCO VEGA'S
GONNA ASK HER
TO THE DANCE.


987
00:41:56.209 --> 00:41:57.245
GOING TO?

988
00:41:57.278 --> 00:41:59.482
IT'S NOT OFFICIAL YET,
BUT ALL THE SIGNS
ARE THERE.


989
00:41:59.515 --> 00:42:01.419
WELL, THEN, THERE'S STILL TIME.

990
00:42:01.453 --> 00:42:02.321
YOU CAN STILL ASK HER.

991
00:42:02.355 --> 00:42:03.690
BUT IT'S MARCO VEGA.

992
00:42:03.723 --> 00:42:05.394
AND YOU'RE CONNOR KENNEDY.

993
00:42:05.427 --> 00:42:07.265
LOOK, DON'T BE LIKE THAT,
LITTLE BRO.


994
00:42:07.298 --> 00:42:09.035
YOU LIKE HER, DON'T YOU?

995
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.769
YEAH.

996
00:42:09.802 --> 00:42:10.847
AND YOU DIDN'T WASH MY UNDERWEAR

997
00:42:10.872 --> 00:42:13.243
FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH
JUST TO LET
SOME CHUMP JUMP IN


998
00:42:13.277 --> 00:42:15.281
AND STEAL YOUR GIRL, DID YOU?

999
00:42:15.314 --> 00:42:16.283
NO.

1000
00:42:16.316 --> 00:42:16.985
THAT'S RIGHT.

1001
00:42:17.018 --> 00:42:18.287
NOW LOOK, YOU'VE COME TOO FAR,

1002
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.555
AND YOU'VE WORKED WAY TO HARD

1003
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:21.193
JUST TO ROLL OVER.

1004
00:42:21.226 --> 00:42:22.095
YEAH, I HAVE.

1005
00:42:22.128 --> 00:42:22.963
NOW, I WANT YOU TO GO
AND FIND THIS GIRL,


1006
00:42:22.997 --> 00:42:24.408
AND I WANT YOU
TO ASK HER TO THE DANCE.


1007
00:42:24.432 --> 00:42:26.103
I'LL DO IT.

1008
00:42:33.283 --> 00:42:34.752
WHAT WITH SCHOOLWORK
AND ALL THAT...


1009
00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.189
HANG ON.

1010
00:42:36.223 --> 00:42:37.725
YEAH. IT'S SAWYER.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.


1011
00:42:37.758 --> 00:42:40.999
HI. THIS IS JAMIE.
LEAVE ME A MESSAGE.


1012
00:42:41.033 --> 00:42:41.867
HEY, JAMIE, IT'S CONNOR.

1013
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.772
CALL ME BACK. I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU. BYE.


1014
00:42:44.805 --> 00:42:47.078
HANG ON. I GOTTA
FINISH THIS CONVERSATION.


1015
00:42:47.111 --> 00:42:48.447
HOLD ON TWO SECONDS.

1016
00:42:52.721 --> 00:42:54.292
CAN YOU HANG ON FOR ONE SECOND?

1017
00:42:54.325 --> 00:42:56.363
GIVE ME TWO MORE SECONDS, OK?

1018
00:42:56.396 --> 00:42:58.600
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OK.

1019
00:43:02.675 --> 00:43:03.410
HELLO.

1020
00:43:03.443 --> 00:43:06.083
HI, MRS. BARTLETT.
IS JAMIE THERE?


1021
00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:07.585
YEAH. JAMIE!

1022
00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:09.255
CONNOR'S ON THE PHONE.

1023
00:43:09.289 --> 00:43:11.493
TELL HIM I'LL CALL HIM
BACK LATER.


1024
00:43:11.526 --> 00:43:13.697
SHE SAID SHE'S GONNA
CALL YOU BACK.


1025
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.035
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. BYE.

1026
00:43:18.107 --> 00:43:22.815
* GOTTA GET UP AND GO,
THERE'S NOTHING TO IT *


1027
00:43:27.391 --> 00:43:30.197
* COME ON, DO IT

1028
00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:31.266
HEY.

1029
00:43:31.299 --> 00:43:32.235
WHERE'S JAMIE?

1030
00:43:32.268 --> 00:43:33.403
SHE'S EXCUSED FROM CLASS.

1031
00:43:33.437 --> 00:43:37.077
SHE HAD A MEETING
WITH HER HANDLER.


1032
00:43:41.753 --> 00:43:43.257
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

1033
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:44.392
I'LL BET SHE FORGOT.

1034
00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:47.531
DON'T WORRY, LINDS.
SHE'LL BE HERE.


1035
00:43:51.739 --> 00:43:52.741
HI. HI.

1036
00:43:52.775 --> 00:43:55.147
HEY, JAMIE. HEY.

1037
00:43:56.616 --> 00:43:58.420
JAMIE!

1038
00:44:00.257 --> 00:44:00.824
JAMIE!

1039
00:44:00.858 --> 00:44:03.864
HEY. YOU LOOK GREAT.

1040
00:44:03.898 --> 00:44:05.401
MOVE IT.

1041
00:44:05.434 --> 00:44:06.236
THANK YOU.

1042
00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:08.373
YOU'RE JUST THE GIRL
I WAS LOOKING FOR.


1043
00:44:08.407 --> 00:44:09.475
WATCH IT!

1044
00:44:09.509 --> 00:44:10.043
I AM?

1045
00:44:10.076 --> 00:44:11.646
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

1046
00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:13.417
JAMIE!

1047
00:44:14.552 --> 00:44:15.487
JAMIE...

1048
00:44:15.521 --> 00:44:16.957
NOT NOW, CONNOR.

1049
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.825
BUT...

1050
00:44:17.859 --> 00:44:19.863
MARCO WAS JUST ABOUT
TO ASK ME SOMETHING.


1051
00:44:19.896 --> 00:44:21.499
I'M SORRY. YOU WERE SAYING?

1052
00:44:21.533 --> 00:44:22.945
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY
AND EVERYTHING


1053
00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:25.474
WITH ALL YOUR "IS" STUFF, BUT...

1054
00:44:25.507 --> 00:44:26.709
JAMIE...

1055
00:44:26.743 --> 00:44:28.680
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE DANCE WITH ME?


1056
00:44:28.713 --> 00:44:31.353
OF COURSE I DO.

1057
00:44:38.567 --> 00:44:40.437
YOU GUYS, I AM SO LATE.

1058
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:41.673
LET ME DROP THIS STUFF OFF,

1059
00:44:41.706 --> 00:44:44.779
AND BOY, DO I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU.

1060
00:44:44.812 --> 00:44:47.751
YEAH, YEAH.
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
NOW LET'S MOVE IT.


1061
00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:48.787
ARE YOU READY?

1062
00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.400
NO. NOT WITHOUT
MY NORMAL HAIR
AND MAKE-UP TEAM.


1063
00:44:50.424 --> 00:44:52.595
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GOING TO
PULL THIS OFF.


1064
00:44:52.628 --> 00:44:54.565
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1065
00:44:54.599 --> 00:44:56.703
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1066
00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:58.473
DON'T TELL ME YOU FORGOT.

1067
00:44:58.507 --> 00:45:00.344
OK. I HAVE REALLY
IMPORTANT NEWS.


1068
00:45:00.377 --> 00:45:03.650
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN SAVING
THE HELPLESS BUNNIES?


1069
00:45:03.683 --> 00:45:05.687
UH, YEAH.

1070
00:45:05.721 --> 00:45:06.589
KIND OF.

1071
00:45:06.623 --> 00:45:08.827
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FORGOT.
WE NEED YOU.


1072
00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:11.433
OH, YOUR PROTEST
IS TODAY, ISN'T IT?


1073
00:45:11.466 --> 00:45:14.472
LINDSAY, IT IS
TOTALLY NOT MY FAULT.


1074
00:45:14.505 --> 00:45:15.574
I ASKED, BUT...

1075
00:45:15.607 --> 00:45:17.678
DIANA TO CALL
TO SEE IF YOU COULD
MOVE IT TO FRIDAY


1076
00:45:17.711 --> 00:45:19.815
BECAUSE I HAVE
THIS PRESS THING
TO DO RIGHT NOW.


1077
00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:20.894
WE'VE BEEN
PLANNING THIS
FOR MONTHS.


1078
00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:23.723
I CAN'T JUST CHANGE
THE DATE TO FIT
YOUR SCHEDULE.


1079
00:45:23.757 --> 00:45:26.363
THIS IS REALLY BAD, ISN'T IT?

1080
00:45:26.396 --> 00:45:27.531
YOU HAVE TO ASK?

1081
00:45:27.565 --> 00:45:29.535
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY,

1082
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:30.804
BUT IT'S FOR THE BOOK,

1083
00:45:30.837 --> 00:45:33.477
AND I HAVE A LIMO
WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE.


1084
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.982
WHATEVER.

1085
00:45:51.914 --> 00:45:53.583
I CAN CALL THEM AT THE RALLY.

1086
00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:56.689
I CAN MAKE THIS WORK
FOR EVERYONE.


1087
00:45:56.723 --> 00:45:59.662
IF I COULD ONLY FIND
MY CELL PHONE.


1088
00:45:59.695 --> 00:46:02.568
SAWYER, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY,


1089
00:46:02.601 --> 00:46:04.405
BUT I REALLY SHOULD BE THERE.

1090
00:46:04.439 --> 00:46:06.576
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER?

1091
00:46:06.609 --> 00:46:08.547
I'M TAPING A SEGMENT
OF RISE AND SHINE.


1092
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.018
TOTALLY LAME,
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO?


1093
00:46:11.052 --> 00:46:12.564
ANYWAY, DO YOU WANT
TO GRAB A BITE
TO EAT LATER?


1094
00:46:12.588 --> 00:46:13.823
ANYTHING BUT PIZZA, EW!

1095
00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:15.527
CAN'T STAND THE STUFF.

1096
00:46:15.561 --> 00:46:17.130
HELLO.

1097
00:46:17.164 --> 00:46:18.166
HEY, THAT IS MY PHONE.

1098
00:46:18.199 --> 00:46:19.602
WELL, YOU WEREN'
T GONNA USE IT

1099
00:46:19.635 --> 00:46:20.571
FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT.

1100
00:46:20.604 --> 00:46:22.608
I LOVE PIZZA.

1101
00:46:22.641 --> 00:46:23.577
AND LINDSAY IS MY FRIEND.

1102
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:26.616
LINDSAY ISN'T GOING
TOO MAKE YOU A SUPERSTAR.


1103
00:46:26.649 --> 00:46:28.854
MAYBE I DON'T WANT
TO BE A SUPERSTAR.


1104
00:46:28.888 --> 00:46:31.626
"I DON'T WANT TO BE A SUPERSTAR.

1105
00:46:31.659 --> 00:46:33.730
I LOVE PIZZA."

1106
00:46:33.763 --> 00:46:35.567
WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU DIDN'T WANT

1107
00:46:35.601 --> 00:46:36.569
THE CUTEST BOY IN SCHOOL

1108
00:46:36.603 --> 00:46:37.872
TO ASK YOU TO THE DANCE EITHER.

1109
00:46:37.906 --> 00:46:38.707
WELL...

1110
00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.546
STOP WHINING AND START
ACTING LIKE IS.


1111
00:46:42.715 --> 00:46:44.018
OH, YOU LOOK ADORABLE.

1112
00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:45.120
SO, YOU READY?

1113
00:46:45.153 --> 00:46:46.990
COME ON.

1114
00:46:47.024 --> 00:46:48.593
UH...

1115
00:46:48.627 --> 00:46:50.631
IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS,

1116
00:46:50.664 --> 00:46:53.703
IT IS INDEFENSIBLE
TO TREAT SMALL,
LITTLE CREATURES,


1117
00:46:53.737 --> 00:46:56.075
SUCH AS THE BUNNY,
IN UNCARING WAYS.


1118
00:46:56.108 --> 00:46:57.678
THEY HAVE ANIMAL TESTING...

1119
00:46:57.711 --> 00:46:58.948
YOU WANT TO SIGN OUR PETITION?

1120
00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:02.087
NO. I WANT TO FIND THE BATHROOM.

1121
00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.594
UH-HUH. AROUND THE CORNER
TO THE LEFT.


1122
00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.675
THIS PROTEST
IS A COMPLETE DISASTER.


1123
00:47:12.708 --> 00:47:14.645
NOW THE BUNNIES
ARE GONNA PAY FOR IT.


1124
00:47:14.679 --> 00:47:17.317
IT'S NOT OUR FAULT
THAT OUR
CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT


1125
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:18.921
PULLED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE.

1126
00:47:18.954 --> 00:47:22.561
NO. IT'S HER HANDLER'S FAULT.

1127
00:47:22.962 --> 00:47:26.202
I LIKED HER BETTER
WHEN SHE DIDN'T
HAVE A HANDLER.


1128
00:47:26.235 --> 00:47:28.707
ME, TOO.

1129
00:47:32.047 --> 00:47:34.920
IN 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1130
00:47:34.953 --> 00:47:36.756
HELLO, I'M CHRISTINE BECKLER,

1131
00:47:36.789 --> 00:47:38.593
AND WELCOME TO RISE AND SHINE.

1132
00:47:38.627 --> 00:47:40.296
TODAY, I'M VERY PLEASED TO HAVE

1133
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.169
HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN
AND BEST SELLING AUTHOR,


1134
00:47:43.202 --> 00:47:44.238
JAMIE BARTLETT.

1135
00:47:44.271 --> 00:47:45.316
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE.

1136
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.112
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO GO FROM
HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN


1137
00:47:48.146 --> 00:47:49.749
TO BEST SELLING AUTHOR

1138
00:47:49.782 --> 00:47:50.383
IN ONE SEMESTER?

1139
00:47:50.416 --> 00:47:52.755
WELL, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

1140
00:47:52.788 --> 00:47:53.657
STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING TO ME,

1141
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.962
BUT AFTER AWHILE,
YOU JUST GET USED TO IT.


1142
00:47:55.995 --> 00:47:58.700
WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT YOUR BOOK,

1143
00:47:58.733 --> 00:47:59.835
"IS SAVES THE WORLD,"

1144
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.940
IS THE FASTEST SELLING
CHILDREN'S BOOK


1145
00:48:01.974 --> 00:48:02.775
IN SCHILLING PRESS HISTORY.

1146
00:48:02.808 --> 00:48:04.845
WELL, WE OBJECT
TO THE WORD "CHILDREN"


1147
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.984
BECAUSE IS RELATES TO EVERYONE.

1148
00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:08.820
WE?

1149
00:48:08.854 --> 00:48:10.858
I MEAN, ME.

1150
00:48:10.892 --> 00:48:11.960
RIGHT.

1151
00:48:11.994 --> 00:48:13.797
YOU'VE SOLD A LOT OF BOOKS.

1152
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:15.033
IT'S IN ITS SECOND PRINTING.

1153
00:48:15.066 --> 00:48:17.070
WOW, DID YOU EVER THINK
IT WOULD DO SO WELL?


1154
00:48:17.104 --> 00:48:21.012
WELL, AS I WAS WRITING
"IS SAVES THE WORLD,"


1155
00:48:21.045 --> 00:48:23.783
I FELT AS IF I HAD
TAPPED INTO SOMETHING


1156
00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:24.819
BIGGER THAN MYSELF.

1157
00:48:24.853 --> 00:48:26.957
AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

1158
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:29.762
AND THAT'S WHAT
SCARES ME THE MOST.


1159
00:48:29.795 --> 00:48:31.432
I'M SORRY, WHAT SCARES YOU?

1160
00:48:31.465 --> 00:48:32.367
OH, NOTHING.

1161
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.373
I JUST MEANT
THAT PEOPLE
CAN REALLY RELATE


1162
00:48:35.406 --> 00:48:36.375
TO THE STORY,

1163
00:48:36.408 --> 00:48:37.912
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHY.

1164
00:48:37.946 --> 00:48:38.780
OH, I DO.

1165
00:48:38.813 --> 00:48:40.383
IT'S A TERRIFIC STORY.

1166
00:48:40.416 --> 00:48:41.385
SO TELL US, JAMIE,

1167
00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:42.287
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE?


1168
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.895
WELL, MY
ENGLISH TEACHER,
MISS GALLAGHER,


1169
00:48:45.928 --> 00:48:47.197
SAID TO WRITE WHAT WE KNOW.

1170
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.769
WAIT. SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT "IS SAVES THE WORLD"


1171
00:48:49.802 --> 00:48:50.536
IS BASED ON REAL EVENTS?

1172
00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.274
OH, I COULDN'T
MAKE THAT STUFF UP.


1173
00:48:52.307 --> 00:48:54.278
AND THE CHARACTERS
ARE REAL AS WELL?


1174
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:55.513
OH, THEY'RE VERY REAL. YES.

1175
00:48:55.546 --> 00:48:57.852
ACTUALLY,
SOME OF MY FANS
HAVE POINTED OUT


1176
00:48:57.886 --> 00:49:01.826
THAT IS IS NO MORE
THAN AN ALTER EGO
OF MYSELF.


1177
00:49:02.795 --> 00:49:04.231
BUT SHE ISN'T.

1178
00:49:04.264 --> 00:49:05.801
AM I IS?

1179
00:49:05.834 --> 00:49:06.769
IS ISN'T.

1180
00:49:06.803 --> 00:49:08.239
IS SHE?

1181
00:49:08.272 --> 00:49:09.141
AM I IS?

1182
00:49:09.174 --> 00:49:11.545
YOU'RE IS?

1183
00:49:11.578 --> 00:49:13.282
THAT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

1184
00:49:13.316 --> 00:49:14.184
IS BATTLES EVIL

1185
00:49:14.218 --> 00:49:16.122
IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE
CHAPTER OF THE BOOK.


1186
00:49:16.155 --> 00:49:16.924
WHAT CAN I SAY?

1187
00:49:16.957 --> 00:49:19.494
EVIL EXISTS IN MANY
DIFFERENT FORMS.


1188
00:49:19.528 --> 00:49:21.398
AND THE MORE I TALK TO THE KIDS,

1189
00:49:21.432 --> 00:49:23.436
THE MORE I REALIZE THAT EVERYONE

1190
00:49:23.469 --> 00:49:24.839
HAS A LITTLE BIT OF IS IN THEM

1191
00:49:24.873 --> 00:49:27.077
AND EVERY SCHOOL HAS A SAWYER.

1192
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:29.314
I'M SORRY. WHO'S SAWYER?

1193
00:49:29.348 --> 00:49:30.250
HOLY COW.

1194
00:49:30.283 --> 00:49:33.389
I THOUGHT THE EVIL VILLAIN'S
NAME WAS MYRNA.


1195
00:49:33.422 --> 00:49:34.291
UH
-OH.

1196
00:49:34.324 --> 00:49:38.566
I DIDN'T SAY SAWYER.
I SAID MYRNA,
RIGHT?


1197
00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:41.138
NO. YOU SAID... 
YOU SAID SAWYER.

1198
00:49:41.172 --> 00:49:42.841
WE HAVE IT ON TAPE.

1199
00:49:42.876 --> 00:49:44.478
BUT... BUT...

1200
00:49:44.511 --> 00:49:46.850
OH, NO.

1201
00:49:46.884 --> 00:49:47.817
WHY DIDN'T I JUST GO

1202
00:49:47.852 --> 00:49:49.493
AND SAVE A LITTLE
CUTE LITTLE
BUNNY RABBIT.


1203
00:49:49.521 --> 00:49:52.027
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.


1204
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.998
OK, THAT'S ALL WE HAVE
TIME FOR TODAY.


1205
00:49:54.031 --> 00:49:55.902
WE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
MISS BARTLETT.


1206
00:49:55.935 --> 00:49:58.908
WE WISH YOU
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS
ON YOUR BOOK.


1207
00:49:58.941 --> 00:50:01.947
UP NEXT, 7 THINGS
IN YOUR TOILET BOWL


1208
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.049
THAT COULD KILL YOU.

1209
00:50:03.082 --> 00:50:04.920
RIGHT AFTER THIS.

1210
00:50:07.959 --> 00:50:09.461
CUT.

1211
00:50:15.506 --> 00:50:17.144
OK, JAMIE. KEEP IT TOGETHER.

1212
00:50:17.177 --> 00:50:21.585
ONLY 20 MORE FEET
UNTIL YOU REACH YOUR LOCKER.


1213
00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:22.956
OH!

1214
00:50:22.989 --> 00:50:23.722
OH, NO!

1215
00:50:23.756 --> 00:50:26.930
JAMIE BARTLETT,
STOP RIGHT THERE.


1216
00:50:26.964 --> 00:50:27.697
BUSTED.

1217
00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:32.942
IS PREPARED TO FACE HER DOOM.

1218
00:50:32.976 --> 00:50:34.980
YOU BASED THAT EVIL WITCH ON ME?

1219
00:50:35.013 --> 00:50:36.648
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE MYRNA?

1220
00:50:36.682 --> 00:50:39.021
NO, NO, NO. IT'S FICTION.

1221
00:50:39.054 --> 00:50:40.992
I SAW THE INTERVIEW
THIS MORNING, BARTLETT.


1222
00:50:41.025 --> 00:50:41.994
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

1223
00:50:42.027 --> 00:50:43.362
WE ALL HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

1224
00:50:43.396 --> 00:50:44.966
I'M SORRY, SAWYER.

1225
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.435
OH, NO. BUT YOU'
RE GOING TO BE.

1226
00:50:46.468 --> 00:50:47.504
I'M GONNA DESTROY YOU

1227
00:50:47.537 --> 00:50:48.506
BECAUSE THIS IS
THE REAL WORLD, JAMIE.


1228
00:50:48.539 --> 00:50:52.147
YOU CAN'T JUST ZAP ME
INTO PERPETUAL DETENTION.


1229
00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.116
ZAP.

1230
00:50:53.149 --> 00:50:54.584
SHE SPEAKS THE TRUTH.

1231
00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:57.157
BUT I'M GONNA ZAP YOU
RIGHT BACK TO LOSERVILLE


1232
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.192
WHERE YOU BELONG.

1233
00:50:58.226 --> 00:50:59.228
LEAVE HER ALONE, SAWYER.

1234
00:50:59.261 --> 00:51:02.167
OH, YOU'RE DEFENDING HER?
HAVE YOU READ HER BOOK?


1235
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.136
YEAH. WHY?

1236
00:51:03.169 --> 00:51:03.970
YOU'RE IN IT, TOO.

1237
00:51:04.004 --> 00:51:05.249
WHO DO YOU THINK
THE MUSCLE-HEADED BOZO


1238
00:51:05.273 --> 00:51:07.010
WITH THE PEA
-SIZED BRAIN IS?

1239
00:51:07.044 --> 00:51:08.546
THAT'S ME?

1240
00:51:08.579 --> 00:51:11.352
NO. IT'S JOSH.

1241
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.789
THAT'S SO NOT COOL.

1242
00:51:13.822 --> 00:51:16.095
SHE WROTE ABOUT ALL OF US.

1243
00:51:16.128 --> 00:51:18.532
SHE TRASHED ALL OF US.

1244
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:23.076
WE'RE THE CLONE
HORRIFIC COHORTS?


1245
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:26.382
CAN I OFFER YOU
A LITTLE PIECE
OF ADVICE?


1246
00:51:26.415 --> 00:51:27.750
YEAH.

1247
00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:29.588
RUN.

1248
00:51:41.478 --> 00:51:42.180
YES, DIANA.

1249
00:51:42.214 --> 00:51:45.620
OH, I THINK THAT'
S A GREAT IDEA.

1250
00:51:45.653 --> 00:51:47.190
UH-HUH. I'M JUST
GONNA RUN IT
BY RALPH,


1251
00:51:47.224 --> 00:51:49.128
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

1252
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:50.730
OK, WHATEVER IT IS,

1253
00:51:50.763 --> 00:51:53.102
I'M SURE IT'S NOT A GREAT IDEA.

1254
00:51:53.136 --> 00:51:54.638
DIANA WANTS TO HAVE
A BOOK SIGNING.


1255
00:51:54.671 --> 00:51:55.640
AT THE PIZZA PARLOR.

1256
00:51:55.673 --> 00:51:59.214
YEAH. SEE, LIKE I SAID,
THAT'S NOT A GREAT IDEA.


1257
00:51:59.248 --> 00:52:00.216
JAMIE...

1258
00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.185
WHAT'S WRONG?

1259
00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:03.722
EVERYTHING, MOTHER.

1260
00:52:07.164 --> 00:52:10.470
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END.

1261
00:52:11.838 --> 00:52:13.142
LENNY!

1262
00:52:13.176 --> 00:52:13.977
OH, NO.

1263
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.746
WILL YOU PLEASE DROP
THE DRAMARAMA ACT.


1264
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:16.748
I'M TOTALLY BORED WITH IT.

1265
00:52:16.782 --> 00:52:18.528
OH, I'M SORRY,
BUT IN CASE
YOU HADN'T NOTICED,


1266
00:52:18.552 --> 00:52:21.124
MY LIFE IS FALLING APART.

1267
00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.164
FALLING APART. HELLO.

1268
00:52:24.198 --> 00:52:25.901
YOUR LIFE IS JUST BEGINNING.

1269
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:27.905
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
SO QUICKLY?


1270
00:52:27.938 --> 00:52:32.247
WE'RE GOING TO
THE DEEP BLUE SEA DANCE
WITH MARCO VEGA.


1271
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:32.814

1272
00:52:32.847 --> 00:52:35.320
WE'RE GOING TO THE...

1273
00:52:35.954 --> 00:52:37.858
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

1274
00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.563
I'M GOING TO THE DANCE
WITH MARCO.


1275
00:52:40.596 --> 00:52:42.400
YOU ARE STAYING HERE.

1276
00:52:42.434 --> 00:52:43.436
GUESS AGAIN.

1277
00:52:43.469 --> 00:52:46.943
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
PULL THIS OFF
WITHOUT ME?


1278
00:52:46.976 --> 00:52:47.544
WELL...

1279
00:52:47.577 --> 00:52:48.880

1281
00:52:50.917 --> 00:52:53.890
YEAH, BUT I WAS
A GREAT WRITER BEFORE YOU.


1282
00:52:53.923 --> 00:52:54.992
REALLY?

1283
00:52:55.025 --> 00:52:58.266
DID YOUR PAPER
ON MITOSIS
GET YOU ON MAURA LIVE?


1284
00:52:58.299 --> 00:53:00.503
DIDN'T THINK SO.

1285
00:53:00.536 --> 00:53:03.342
JAMIE, YOU AND I ARE A TEAM.

1286
00:53:03.376 --> 00:53:05.480
WE DON'T NEED SAWYER
OR THE POPULARS.


1287
00:53:05.513 --> 00:53:08.987
OUR BOOK IS ON
THE NATIONAL
BEST SELLER LIST.


1288

00:53:11.993 --> 00:53:13.897
YEAH. ONLY THE PEOPLE
WHO DON'T KNOW US.


1291
00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:16.468
WHO CARES AS LONG
AS THEY KEEP
BUYING THE BOOK.


1292
00:53:16.502 --> 00:53:19.641
I WOULD RATHER HAVE
FRIENDS THAN FANS ANY DAY.


1293
00:53:19.674 --> 00:53:20.911
YEAH, RIGHT.

1294
00:53:20.944 --> 00:53:21.778
I WOULD.

1295
00:53:21.812 --> 00:53:23.582
THAT'S IT. IS IS OVER.

1296
00:53:23.616 --> 00:53:25.686
I AM NEVER WRITING
ANOTHER WORD ABOUT YOU.


1297
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.858
I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WERE YOU.


1298
00:53:27.891 --> 00:53:29.862
NOW, IF YOU WON'T
THINK ABOUT YOURSELF,


1299
00:53:29.895 --> 00:53:32.734
AND YOU'RE NOT THE GIRL
I THINK YOU ARE
IF YOU WON'T.


1300
00:53:32.767 --> 00:53:34.404
THEN THINK ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

1301
00:53:34.438 --> 00:53:35.640
BUSINESS IS BOOMING RIGHT NOW.

1302
00:53:35.673 --> 00:53:36.876
AND LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING,

1303
00:53:36.909 --> 00:53:37.844
THAT DOESN'T HAVE

1304
00:53:37.878 --> 00:53:40.550
ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE LIVER AND ONION PIZZA.


1305
00:53:40.583 --> 00:53:42.019
SO IF YOU SAY GOOD BYE TO ME,

1306
00:53:42.053 --> 00:53:44.591
YOU SAY GOOD BYE
TO THE PIZZA PARLOR FOREVER.


1307
00:53:44.624 --> 00:53:45.894
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

1308
00:53:45.927 --> 00:53:47.330
IT WAS HAPPENING.

1309
00:53:47.364 --> 00:53:48.399
IS WAS TAKING OVER.

1310
00:53:48.432 --> 00:53:50.937
SHE WAS SAYING
EVERYTHING I WAS THINKING.


1311
00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:54.010
UNFILTERED, UNCENSORED,

1312
00:53:54.043 --> 00:53:56.648
UNPLUGGED.

1313
00:54:01.057 --> 00:54:02.928
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1314
00:54:09.841 --> 00:54:10.977
WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF.

1315
00:54:11.011 --> 00:54:14.518
WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE
THE FAMILY IN HERE.


1316
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:19.628
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

1317
00:54:27.677 --> 00:54:28.779
WHAT?

1318
00:54:28.812 --> 00:54:29.781
I NEED QUIET.

1319
00:54:29.814 --> 00:54:30.951
OH, I'M SORRY IF MY MUSIC

1320
00:54:30.984 --> 00:54:32.530
IS INTERRUPTING YOU
TALKING TO YOURSELF.


1321
00:54:32.554 --> 00:54:33.923
YOU CALL THAT NOISE MUSIC?

1322
00:54:33.957 --> 00:54:36.061
WHY DON'T YOU DO US BOTH A FAVOR

1323
00:54:36.094 --> 00:54:37.898
AND GIVE IT UP.

1324
00:54:53.729 --> 00:54:56.869
HEY, THIS ISN'T
FAIR AND BALANCED.


1325
00:54:56.903 --> 00:55:00.209
I NEVER SAID MR. CLARK HAD B.O.

1326
00:55:07.624 --> 00:55:10.262
4 COLUMNS OF LETTERS
TO THE EDITOR.


1327
00:55:10.295 --> 00:55:12.935
WHAT KIND OF
YELLOW JOURNALISM IS THIS?


1328
00:55:12.968 --> 00:55:14.804
AND THEY'RE ALL ANTI IS.

1329
00:55:14.838 --> 00:55:16.274
NO, THEY'RE NOT, JAMIE.

1330
00:55:16.307 --> 00:55:18.980
THEY'RE ALL ANTI YOU.

1331
00:55:30.135 --> 00:55:32.106
YOU MIND IF I SIT HERE?

1332
00:55:33.943 --> 00:55:36.047
YEAH. GO FOR IT.

1333
00:55:45.733 --> 00:55:48.739
WOW. YOU REALLY KNOW
HOW TO SHAKE THINGS UP.


1334
00:55:48.772 --> 00:55:51.177
IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL.

1335
00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:52.580
IT'S JUST WHAT
THIS PLACE NEEDED.


1336
00:55:52.614 --> 00:55:55.820
HEY, SO, IS MYRNA
REALLY BASED
ON SAWYER?


1337
00:55:55.854 --> 00:55:58.158
ONLY A LITTLE.

1338
00:55:58.191 --> 00:55:59.728
OK. A LOT.

1339
00:55:59.761 --> 00:56:00.596
THAT'S SO COOL.

1340
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:02.042
AND ALL THE OTHER
CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK


1341
00:56:02.066 --> 00:56:03.903
ARE REALLY STUDENTS HERE?

1342
00:56:03.937 --> 00:56:05.272
KIND OF.

1343
00:56:05.305 --> 00:56:06.675
SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE IS?

1344
00:56:06.708 --> 00:56:09.113
WELL, SHE'D BE
NOTHING WITHOUT ME.


1345
00:56:09.147 --> 00:56:13.188
AND I'M MARCO VINCENT, RIGHT?

1346
00:56:13.221 --> 00:56:14.859
YEAH.

1347
00:56:14.892 --> 00:56:16.094
SWEET.

1348
00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:20.636
HEY, CONNOR. HEY.

1349
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:21.838
WHAT'S WRONG?

1350
00:56:21.873 --> 00:56:23.108
HAVE YOU TALKED TO JAMIE?

1351
00:56:23.141 --> 00:56:25.212
NO. AND I DON'T
REALLY PLAN ON IT.


1352
00:56:25.245 --> 00:56:27.283
SHE'S GOING TO THE DANCE
WITH MARCO.


1353
00:56:27.316 --> 00:56:28.351
OH, WHATEV.

1354
00:56:28.385 --> 00:56:29.855
I'M SO SICK OF HER.

1355
00:56:29.889 --> 00:56:31.133
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
IGUANAS I BATHED


1356
00:56:31.157 --> 00:56:32.895
TO GET THAT CAR FOR THE DANCE?

1357
00:56:32.928 --> 00:56:34.030
HEY.

1358
00:56:34.063 --> 00:56:35.165
HERE SHE COMES.

1359
00:56:35.199 --> 00:56:36.101
HEY, GUYS.

1360
00:56:36.134 --> 00:56:37.236
YOU GUYS...

1361
00:56:37.269 --> 00:56:39.774
YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

1362
00:56:41.244 --> 00:56:42.279
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1363
00:56:42.313 --> 00:56:44.383
YES. SAWYER'S RUNNING
A SMEAR CAMPAIGN
AGAINST ME.


1364
00:56:44.417 --> 00:56:46.287
I NEED SOME POSITIVE PR,

1365
00:56:46.321 --> 00:56:47.790
AND THAT'S WHERE
YOU GUYS COME IN.


1366
00:56:47.824 --> 00:56:50.229
HAVE YOUR HANDLER HANDLE IT.

1367
00:56:50.262 --> 00:56:52.800
WHAT'S HER DAMAGE?

1368
00:56:52.834 --> 00:56:54.303
YOU ARE.

1369
00:56:55.139 --> 00:56:56.107
CONNOR?

1370
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:58.812
I GOT LAUNDRY TO DO.

1371
00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:03.021
BUT...

1372
00:57:03.055 --> 00:57:05.259
YOU GUYS, I...

1373
00:57:10.235 --> 00:57:11.504
WELL, I TRIED IT.

1374
00:57:11.537 --> 00:57:15.145
GOOD IDEA.
I CAN TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.


1375
00:57:18.151 --> 00:57:20.891
SHE'S SUCH A MYRNA.

1376
00:57:25.232 --> 00:57:26.301
COME ON, MARCO.

1377
00:57:26.334 --> 00:57:29.207
WHY DON'T WE SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1378
00:57:40.129 --> 00:57:41.031
OH, I NEVER TOLD YOU

1379
00:57:41.064 --> 00:57:42.209
HOW MUCH I LIKED
THAT POEM
THAT YOU WROTE.


1380
00:57:42.233 --> 00:57:44.537
OH... DON'T BRING THAT UP.

1381
00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:45.907
THAT WAS TOO EMBARRASSING.

1382
00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:48.111
READING THAT
IN FRONT OF THE CLASS.


1383
00:57:48.145 --> 00:57:49.013
SO LAME.

1384
00:57:49.047 --> 00:57:50.182
NO, IT WASN'T.

1385
00:57:50.215 --> 00:57:53.288
I LOVED IT. IT WAS SO...

1386
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:54.190
REAL.

1387
00:57:54.223 --> 00:57:56.361
ARE YOU GONNA EAT THOSE?

1388
00:57:58.565 --> 00:58:00.269
UH... NO.

1389
00:58:04.243 --> 00:58:05.981
MMM...

1390
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:15.475
WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

1391
00:58:15.499 --> 00:58:17.871
WE PUT ADS IN ALL
THE LOCAL PAPERS.


1392
00:58:17.905 --> 00:58:19.909
THIS PLACE SHOULD BE
A MADHOUSE BY NOW.


1393
00:58:19.942 --> 00:58:20.877
WELL, BUSINESS HAS BEEN
KIND OF OFF


1394
00:58:20.911 --> 00:58:23.281
SINCE JAMIE'S
LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT
LAST WEEK.


1395
00:58:23.315 --> 00:58:24.559
MAYBE ALL WE NEED IS A NEW PIZZA

1396
00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:25.552
TO PICK THINGS UP.

1397
00:58:25.585 --> 00:58:28.491
PICKLE PORK EARED PIZZA, PEG?

1398
00:58:30.429 --> 00:58:32.266
MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO CUT OUR LOSSES.


1399
00:58:32.299 --> 00:58:34.403
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

1400
00:58:34.437 --> 00:58:37.176
I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE ONLY SOLD TWO BOOKS.


1401
00:58:37.209 --> 00:58:40.082
IT'S A GOOD THING
RALPH'S PARENTS
SHOWED UP.


1402
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:43.455
OH, GOOD. MMM.

1403
00:58:44.123 --> 00:58:46.361
WAIT. HERE THEY COME!

1404
00:58:46.394 --> 00:58:50.202
CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE CUSTOMERS.

1405
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:53.508
WHA... WAIT! WAIT!

1406
00:58:59.653 --> 00:59:01.024
HOOLIGANS.

1407
00:59:01.057 --> 00:59:03.395
WE HAVE HOOLIGANS.

1408
00:59:03.428 --> 00:59:05.299
WHAT HAPPENED?

1409
00:59:22.333 --> 00:59:22.967
I'M BACK.

1410
00:59:23.001 --> 00:59:25.005
LINDSAY, DON'T SNEAK UP ON ME

1411
00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:27.009
WHEN I'M WORKING
ON OUR MASTERPIECE.


1412
00:59:27.043 --> 00:59:29.380
YEAH. I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD STUFF


1413
00:59:29.413 --> 00:59:30.715
OUR MASTERPIECE WITH.

1414
00:59:30.749 --> 00:59:32.353
OH, I KNOW.

1415
00:59:32.386 --> 00:59:34.157
I HAVE BEEN
DRIVING MYSELF BONKERS.


1416
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:37.163
WHAT IS GONNA GIVE
OUR WHALE LIFE?


1417
00:59:37.196 --> 00:59:38.431
NEWSPAPER?

1418
00:59:38.465 --> 00:59:41.204
FOAM... PACKING PEANUTS?

1419
00:59:41.237 --> 00:59:42.373
YEAH. ALL GREAT SUGGESTIONS,

1420
00:59:42.406 --> 00:59:47.416
BUT I WAS THINKING
OF SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE PROACTIVE.


1421
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:50.455
AND...

1422
00:59:53.561 --> 00:59:55.199
I KNOW THIS WHALE
MEANS A LOT TO YOU,


1423
00:59:55.232 --> 00:59:57.569
BUT THIS IS
AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY


1424
00:59:57.603 --> 00:59:58.538
TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

1425
00:59:58.571 --> 01:00:00.675
I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

1426
01:00:00.709 --> 01:00:03.548
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1427
01:00:05.485 --> 01:00:09.393
I THINK...
IT'LL TAKE OUR CREATION
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.


1428
01:00:09.427 --> 01:00:11.697
TRUE ART ISN'T MEANT
TO BE JUST SEEN.


1429
01:00:11.731 --> 01:00:12.633
IT'S MEANT TO BE EXPERIENCED.

1430
01:00:12.666 --> 01:00:15.472
YOU CAN'T
GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.


1431
01:00:15.505 --> 01:00:17.509
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.


1432
01:00:17.543 --> 01:00:18.811
WHAT THEY NEED.

1433
01:00:18.845 --> 01:00:20.382
WAS THAT A YES?

1434
01:00:20.415 --> 01:00:23.087
THAT WAS A HECK YES.

1435
01:00:25.259 --> 01:00:26.494
THAT WAS HUMILIATING.

1436
01:00:26.527 --> 01:00:27.296
LOCAL MARKET'S FICKLE.

1437
01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:29.467
YOU SAID THAT BUSINESS
WOULD PICK UP,


1438
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.604
BUT IT'S BEEN EMPTY ALL WEEK.

1439
01:00:31.637 --> 01:00:32.907
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

1440
01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.911
NOBODY WANTS TO EAT
WITH A TATTLETALE.


1441
01:00:34.944 --> 01:00:36.247
THEY'RE ALL AFRAID OF YOU.

1442
01:00:36.281 --> 01:00:37.416
NO. THEY'RE AFRAID OF YOU.

1443
01:00:37.449 --> 01:00:41.491
ME? I'M JUST
A FIGMENT
OF YOUR IMAGINATION.


1444
01:00:41.524 --> 01:00:42.193
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

1445
01:00:42.226 --> 01:00:44.898
YOU'RE A MONSTER, AND, AND...

1446
01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.471
AND I AM, TOO.

1447
01:00:48.838 --> 01:00:50.409
LENNY'S GIVEN UP ON MUSIC

1448
01:00:50.442 --> 01:00:53.481
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SAID TO HIM.

1449
01:00:58.658 --> 01:01:00.462
LENNY, OPEN UP.

1450
01:01:03.401 --> 01:01:05.605
* THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY *

1451
01:01:05.639 --> 01:01:09.447
I DIDN'T MEAN THOSE THINGS
THAT I SAID YESTERDAY.


1452
01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.584
* NEVER HEAR ABOUT...

1453
01:01:11.617 --> 01:01:14.490
IT'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO GIVE UP MUSIC.


1454
01:01:14.523 --> 01:01:17.396
* ...WORD TRAVELS FAST

1455
01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:19.267
* I'M TELLING YOU TO YOUR FACE *

1456
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.408
* I'M STANDING HERE
BEHIND YOUR BACK *


1457
01:01:23.441 --> 01:01:26.614
* YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS *

1458
01:01:26.647 --> 01:01:28.017
* TO BE OUTSIDE THE CROWD *

1459
01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.990
* YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE *


1460
01:01:31.023 --> 01:01:32.860
* TO FEEL THAT YOU'RE OUT

1461
01:01:32.894 --> 01:01:35.966
* AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW IT FEELS *


1462
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.041
* TO BE YOUR OWN MESS AGAIN *

1463
01:01:40.074 --> 01:01:46.387
* ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN *

1464
01:01:47.756 --> 01:01:52.666
* IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND *

1465
01:01:53.535 --> 01:01:55.339
* YOU MIGHT SEE

1466
01:01:55.372 --> 01:01:58.778
* MORE OF ME
THAN MEETS THE EYE *


1467
01:01:58.811 --> 01:02:01.317
* AND YOU'VE BEEN ALL WRONG *

1468
01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:04.924
* ABOUT WHO YOU THINK I AM *

1469
01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:07.897
* YOU'VE NEVER
GIVEN ME A CHANCE *


1470
01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:11.437
* YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS *

1471
01:02:11.471 --> 01:02:13.508
* TO BE OUTSIDE ALONE

1472
01:02:13.541 --> 01:02:16.514
* YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE *


1473
01:02:16.547 --> 01:02:18.117
* TO BE LEFT OUT

1474
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:21.090
* YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS *

1475
01:02:21.123 --> 01:02:25.098
* TO BE HOPELESS AGAIN

1476
01:02:25.131 --> 01:02:29.673
* ON THE OUTSIDE AGAIN

1477
01:02:29.707 --> 01:02:30.442
* NO, NO

1478
01:02:30.475 --> 01:02:33.014
* I'M TIRED OF STAYING AT HOME *

1479
01:02:33.047 --> 01:02:36.721
* I'M BORED AND ALL ALONE

1480
01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:40.695
* I'M SICK OF WASTING
ALL MY TIME *


1481
01:02:40.729 --> 01:02:44.169
* YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS *

1482
01:02:44.202 --> 01:02:45.805
* TO BE OUTSIDE THE CROWD *

1483
01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:49.079
* YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE *


1484
01:02:49.112 --> 01:02:50.649
* TO FEEL IN DOUBT

1485
01:02:50.682 --> 01:02:53.755
* YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS *

1486
01:02:53.788 --> 01:02:57.496
* TO BE ALONE

1487
01:02:57.529 --> 01:03:03.608
* ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN *

1488
01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:06.747
OK, THIS IS GETTING
A LITTLE OUT OF HAND.


1489
01:03:06.781 --> 01:03:10.021
SINCE WHEN DOES THE SPARTAN
HAVE 5 PAGES


1490
01:03:10.054 --> 01:03:12.693
OF LETTERS TO THE EDITOR?

1491
01:03:13.761 --> 01:03:14.563
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

1492
01:03:14.597 --> 01:03:17.636
THEY'RE NOT ALL BAD.
CHECK OUT PAGE 8.


1493
01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:20.642
"THREE CHEERS
FOR JAMIE BARTLETT.


1494

"DON'T BE EMBARRASSED
THAT SHE SAW
WHO WE REALLY WERE.

"BE EMBARRASSED THAT
WE NEVER REALLY SAW HER.

A FRIEND."

01:03:51.804 --> 01:03:53.240
YEAH. I'M OK.

1505
01:03:53.274 --> 01:03:55.278
DID YOU SEE THIS?

1506
01:03:55.311 --> 01:03:56.882
SEE IT.

1507
01:03:56.915 --> 01:03:59.086
AT LEAST MARCO THINKS
I'M PRETTY SPECIAL.


1508
01:03:59.119 --> 01:03:59.854
HUH?

1509
01:03:59.888 --> 01:04:01.691
I'D RECOGNIZE
HIS STYLE ANYWHERE.


1510
01:04:01.724 --> 01:04:04.730
IT'S JUST LIKE HIS POEM.

1511
01:04:04.763 --> 01:04:05.832
OH, AND CONNOR...

1512
01:04:05.866 --> 01:04:07.812
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR BEING THERE
THE OTHER NIGHT.


1513
01:04:07.836 --> 01:04:10.575
YOU'RE REALLY A GREAT FRIEND.

THERE YOU ARE.

1517
01:04:25.739 --> 01:04:26.875
AND THERE YOU IS.

1518
01:04:26.908 --> 01:04:28.711
THAT IS THE SWEETEST THING

1519
01:04:28.745 --> 01:04:30.381
ANYBODY HAS EVER DONE FOR ME.

1520
01:04:30.414 --> 01:04:32.786
I'LL PLAY ALONG.

1521
01:04:32.819 --> 01:04:33.688
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1522
01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:35.024
DON'T BE MODEST.

1523
01:04:35.058 --> 01:04:36.193
I KNOW IT WAS YOU

1524
01:04:36.226 --> 01:04:38.297
WHO WROTE THE LETTER
TO THE EDITOR ABOUT ME.


1525
01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:39.833
THE POSITIVE ONE.

1526
01:04:39.868 --> 01:04:40.903
IT'S JUST NICE TO KNOW

1527
01:04:40.936 --> 01:04:44.176
THAT IN THE FACE
OF ALL THIS
NEGATIVITY TOWARDS ME,


1528
01:04:44.209 --> 01:04:48.150
HOWEVER UNWARRANTED
AND MEAN IT REALLY IS.


1529
01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:49.386
IT'S JUST NICE TO KNOW

1530
01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:50.856
THAT THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE

1531
01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:52.192
WHO KNOWS THE REAL ME.

1532
01:04:52.225 --> 01:04:53.929
OH, AND MARCO...

1533
01:04:53.962 --> 01:04:56.801
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DANCE.

1534
01:04:56.834 --> 01:05:00.041
PLUS, I'D RECOGNIZE
YOUR STYLE ANYWHERE.


1535
01:05:00.074 --> 01:05:01.744
WHY, THANK YOU, IS.

1536
01:05:01.777 --> 01:05:03.114
IT'S JAMIE.

1537
01:05:03.147 --> 01:05:05.752
RIGHT. SORRY.

1538
01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:09.659
HEY, SO WHAT TIME
SHOULD I PICK YOU UP?


1539
01:05:14.336 --> 01:05:16.040
WELL, IT WAS FUN
WHILE IT LASTED,


1540
01:05:16.073 --> 01:05:18.444
BUT EVEN LAST MONTH'S
INCREDIBLE SALES


1541
01:05:18.477 --> 01:05:20.916
AREN'T GONNA COVER
LAST YEAR'S LOSSES.


1542
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.028
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE WRONG

1543
01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:23.856
ABOUT THAT PÖTÉ PIZZA, PEG.

1544
01:05:23.889 --> 01:05:25.725
LET'S GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY.

1545
01:05:25.759 --> 01:05:27.395
RALPH, HONEY...

1546
01:05:27.428 --> 01:05:28.999
ANOTHER INEDIBLE TOPPING

1547
01:05:29.032 --> 01:05:30.277
ISN'T GONNA SAVE OUR RESTAURANT.

1548
01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:33.107
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA
COME OUT AHEAD


1549
01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.378
IS BY SELLING
THE PIZZA PARLOR NOW.


1550
01:05:35.411 --> 01:05:37.749
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

1551
01:05:37.783 --> 01:05:41.757
I HATE TO ADMIT IT.
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.


1552
01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:58.124
* SLIP ME THE ANSWER

1553
01:05:58.157 --> 01:06:00.996
* OR GIVE ME A CLUE

1554
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:04.102
* DO YOU THINK THE PARTY

1555
01:06:04.136 --> 01:06:07.910
* IS ALL ABOUT YOU

1556
01:06:07.944 --> 01:06:11.852
* YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE

1557
01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:13.821
* YOU'RE EVERYWHERE

1558
01:06:13.856 --> 01:06:16.962
* SOMETIMES OUT OF FOCUS

1559
01:06:16.995 --> 01:06:20.101
* BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE

1560
01:06:20.134 --> 01:06:23.274
* YOU WAKE UP AT SUNDOWN

1561
01:06:23.307 --> 01:06:26.546
* YOU'RE IN THE WRONG BED

1562
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.854
* WITH ALL THESE QUESTIONS

1563
01:06:29.888 --> 01:06:32.994
* EATING YOUR HEAD

1564
01:06:33.027 --> 01:06:36.400
* WHO DID YOU MEET THERE

1565
01:06:36.433 --> 01:06:39.372
* WHAT DID YOU DO

1566
01:06:39.406 --> 01:06:42.478
* FORGOTTEN BY MANY

1567
01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:46.888
* REMEMBERED BY FEW

1568
01:06:46.922 --> 01:06:49.961
* YOU THINK EVERYBODY
LOVES YOU *


1569
01:06:49.994 --> 01:06:57.275
* BUT EVERYBODY HATES THE SAME *

1570
01:06:59.646 --> 01:07:02.652
* DON'T GET IN THE MIDDLE

1571
01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:09.934
* KNOW THAT TIMES
ARE HARD ALL DAY *


1572
01:07:12.405 --> 01:07:15.211
* EVERYBODY LOVES YOU

1573
01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:23.252
* STILL NOBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME *

1574
01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:29.039
* YOUR NAME

1575
01:07:31.376 --> 01:07:32.654
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
MOPING ABOUT.


1576
01:07:32.678 --> 01:07:34.716
YOU GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED,
DIDN'T YOU?


1577
01:07:34.749 --> 01:07:36.653
A BOYFRIEND AND A SEQUEL?

1578
01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:38.290
WHAT ABOUT MY FRIENDS?

1579
01:07:38.324 --> 01:07:40.261
OR MY BROTHER'S DREAMS?

1580
01:07:40.294 --> 01:07:42.265
OR MY PARENTS' PIZZA PARLOR?

1581
01:07:42.298 --> 01:07:44.136
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY
IN YOUR TRUST FUND.


1582
01:07:44.169 --> 01:07:45.104
YOU'LL BE FINE.

1583
01:07:45.138 --> 01:07:47.275
EXCUSE ME? THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

1584
01:07:47.308 --> 01:07:48.344
THIS IS ABOUT MY FAMILY.

1585
01:07:48.377 --> 01:07:50.348
DON'T YOU GET IT, JAMIE?

1586
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:53.220
IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.

1587
01:07:54.522 --> 01:07:56.060
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

1588
01:07:56.093 --> 01:07:58.364
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1589
01:08:00.801 --> 01:08:02.738
WHERE'S OUR LITTLE GIRL?

1590
01:08:02.772 --> 01:08:05.578
READY FOR THE DANCE, PRINCESS?

1591
01:08:05.611 --> 01:08:07.148
HONEY?

1592
01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:08.217
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1593
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:11.156
YEAH. I THINK I'M GOING
TO BE FINE.


1594
01:08:12.358 --> 01:08:13.794
JUST FINE.

1595
01:08:24.449 --> 01:08:26.453
LET'S GO.

1596
01:08:27.288 --> 01:08:28.124
ARE YOU OK?

1597
01:08:28.157 --> 01:08:28.991
YEAH. I JUST THOUGHT

1598
01:08:29.025 --> 01:08:30.862
THAT THIS WOULD BE
DIFFERENT, THAT'S ALL.


1599
01:08:30.895 --> 01:08:33.267
COME ON. LET'S JUST
GET THIS OVER WITH.


1600
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:37.508
OUCH. NOT THE MOST
POSITIVE WAY
TO START A DATE, IS.


1601
01:08:37.542 --> 01:08:41.250
WOULD YOU PLEASE
STOP CALLING ME IS?


1602
01:08:44.289 --> 01:08:46.460
HI, JAMIE. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

1603
01:08:46.493 --> 01:08:48.430
THANK YOU. SO DO YOU.

1604
01:08:48.464 --> 01:08:50.801
AND MARCO, VERY HANDSOME.

1605
01:08:50.834 --> 01:08:54.309
ZAP AT YOU, MISS G.

1606
01:09:29.512 --> 01:09:30.915
ALL ECOSYSTEMS GO.

1607
01:09:30.949 --> 01:09:34.957
OH, IT'S GONNA BE
A WHALE OF A TIME.


1608
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:51.290
GUYS, WHAT'S UP?

1609
01:09:51.323 --> 01:09:52.692
HEY, LENNY.

1610
01:09:52.725 --> 01:09:54.863
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.


1611
01:09:54.897 --> 01:09:57.468
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1612
01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:02.445
YOU WANT SOME PUNCH, IS?

1613
01:10:02.478 --> 01:10:04.850
NO, BUT I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT

1614
01:10:04.883 --> 01:10:07.422
IF YOU WOULD STOP CALLING ME IS.

1615
01:10:07.455 --> 01:10:08.858
SORRY.

1616
01:10:08.891 --> 01:10:11.830
WELL, I WANT SOME PUNCH.

1617
01:10:14.035 --> 01:10:15.704
SORRY FOR CALLING YOU IS.

1618
01:10:15.738 --> 01:10:17.508
I THINK YOU'RE
REALLY COOL, JAMIE.


1619
01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:18.878
NONE OF MY FRIENDS CAN BELIEVE

1620
01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:21.884
THAT SOMEONE
AS SMART AS YOU
SAID YES TO ME.


1621
01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.320
THAT'S CRAZY.

1622
01:10:23.354 --> 01:10:24.789
YOU'RE SO SMART,

1623
01:10:24.822 --> 01:10:27.828
AND YOU'RE AN AMAZING WRITER,

1624
01:10:27.863 --> 01:10:28.764
AND A POET.

1625
01:10:28.797 --> 01:10:29.666
THAT STUPID POEM?

1626
01:10:29.699 --> 01:10:31.937
I WOULD NEVER
WRITE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.


1627
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:33.039
EXCUSE ME?

1628
01:10:33.073 --> 01:10:36.346
I PAID THAT DORK CONNOR
TO DO THE ASSIGNMENT
FOR ME.


1629
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.415
CONNOR?

1630
01:10:37.448 --> 01:10:40.020
WHO CARES? HE'S HOT.
LET'S DANCE.


1631
01:10:40.053 --> 01:10:42.592
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS.

1632
01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:44.897
CALM DOWN. JUST HOMEWORK, RIGHT?

1633
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.700
I HELP YOU WITH YOURS.

1634
01:10:46.733 --> 01:10:48.971
IT'S THE PRINCIPLE.

1635
01:10:49.005 --> 01:10:50.617
WHAT DOES THE PRINCIPAL
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?


1636
01:10:50.641 --> 01:10:53.714
IF I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
YOU WILL NEVER KNOW.


1637
01:10:53.747 --> 01:10:54.983
WILL YOU PLEASE JUST SHUT UP

1638
01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.085
AND DANCE WITH HIM?

1639
01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:57.121
BUT HE'S NOT THE ONE

1640
01:10:57.154 --> 01:10:59.592
THAT I SHOULD BE DANCING WITH.

1641
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.964
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

1642
01:11:01.997 --> 01:11:03.099
I'M LOST.

1643
01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:05.838
YOU, WITH ME, NOW!

1644
01:11:15.758 --> 01:11:16.693
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1645
01:11:16.726 --> 01:11:19.065
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
TRAPPED IN MY COMPUTER.


1646
01:11:19.098 --> 01:11:23.540
ARE WE ALL HAVING A GOOD TIME?

1647
01:11:25.778 --> 01:11:28.784
YOU THINK YOU CAN
GET RID OF ME
THAT EASILY?


1648
01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:29.819
WE'RE A TEAM.

1649
01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:31.991
LIKE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO.

1650
01:11:32.024 --> 01:11:34.897
MORE LIKE DR. JEKYLL
AND MRS. HYDE.


1651
01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:36.800
YOU MADE ME WHAT I AM TODAY.

1652
01:11:36.833 --> 01:11:38.470
YES, BUT I WAS THE NICE ONE.

1653
01:11:38.504 --> 01:11:41.175
I HAD FRIENDS BEFORE I HAD YOU.

1654
01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:42.177
YOU HAD NOTHING.

1655
01:11:42.211 --> 01:11:43.814
YOU WERE INVISIBLE.

1656
01:11:43.847 --> 01:11:45.584
EVERYONE HATED YOU.

1657
01:11:45.618 --> 01:11:46.653
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1658
01:11:46.686 --> 01:11:48.123
THEY HATED WHAT I BECAME.

1659
01:11:48.156 --> 01:11:51.095
AND I WANT TO THANK
ONE SPECIAL GIRL


1660
01:11:51.129 --> 01:11:53.033
WHO IN SPITE OF
TREMENDOUS OBLIGATIONS


1661
01:11:53.066 --> 01:11:55.571
AND RESPONSIBILITIES,
TOOK THE TIME


1662
01:11:55.604 --> 01:11:57.041
TO MAKE ALL THE BEAUTIFUL

1663
01:11:57.074 --> 01:11:59.045
DECORATIONS IN THE GYM TONIGHT.

1664
01:11:59.078 --> 01:12:00.882
AND IF CONNOR WROTE THE POEM,

1665
01:12:00.915 --> 01:12:03.820
THEN HE HAD TO WRITE
THE LETTER IN THE PAPER.


1666
01:12:03.855 --> 01:12:06.593
AND JUST LOOK AT THAT WHALE.

1667
01:12:12.973 --> 01:12:14.075
CONNOR SEES THE REAL ME.

1668
01:12:14.108 --> 01:12:17.214
I'VE BEEN SUCH
A HORRIBLE FRIEND TO HIM.


1669
01:12:17.247 --> 01:12:19.586
I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME.

1670
01:12:19.619 --> 01:12:20.754
JAMIE BARTLETT!

1671
01:12:24.128 --> 01:12:26.867
GET OUT HERE AND TAKE A BOW.

1672
01:12:26.901 --> 01:12:27.869
ME?

1673
01:12:27.903 --> 01:12:29.138
YES.

1674
01:12:29.171 --> 01:12:30.107
WE WANT TO THANK YOU

1675
01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.351
FOR ALL THE GOOD
YOU'VE DONE
FOR THE SCHOOL.


1676
01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:34.181
PLEASE. COME HERE.

1677
01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:36.954
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR THIS?

1678
01:12:36.987 --> 01:12:39.191
LET'S JUST PULL IT NOW.

1679
01:12:40.393 --> 01:12:41.329
JUST GIVE HER A SECOND.

1680
01:12:41.362 --> 01:12:45.103
FOR YOUR TIRELESS
DEDICATION
AND COMMITMENT,


1681
01:12:45.137 --> 01:12:47.675
AND YOUR AMAZING CREATIVITY.

1682
01:12:47.708 --> 01:12:49.211
ACCEPT OUR GRATITUDE.

1683
01:12:49.245 --> 01:12:51.683
AND THESE ROSES.

1684
01:12:51.716 --> 01:12:52.785
YEAH. WHATEVER.

1685
01:12:55.724 --> 01:13:00.267
NOW, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO US?


1686
01:13:02.973 --> 01:13:04.341
BOO!

1687
01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:06.713
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO WIN THEM BACK.


1688
01:13:06.746 --> 01:13:10.053
SHOW THEM HOW GREAT
WE REALLY ARE.


1689
01:13:10.087 --> 01:13:12.091
TELL THEM ABOUT THE SEQUEL.

1690
01:13:12.825 --> 01:13:14.696
PROMISE SAWYER
A ROLE IN THE MOVIE.


1691
01:13:14.729 --> 01:13:16.099
BOO!

1692
01:13:16.132 --> 01:13:17.201
YOU CAN DO IT.

1693
01:13:17.234 --> 01:13:18.770
JUST BE YOURSELF.

1694
01:13:18.804 --> 01:13:20.909
AND, NO, BE ME.

1695
01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:25.919
THANK YOU, MISS GALLAGHER,
FOR THOSE KIND WORDS.


1696
01:13:25.952 --> 01:13:26.887
AFTER THE WEEK I'VE HAD,

1697
01:13:26.921 --> 01:13:28.991
IT'S NICE TO BE APPRECIATED.

1698
01:13:31.495 --> 01:13:34.201
WHOO! JAMIE!

1699
01:13:34.235 --> 01:13:36.305
YOU SAID THAT THIS WOULD WORK.

1700
01:13:36.339 --> 01:13:38.209
KEEP GOING.

1701
01:13:38.243 --> 01:13:40.347
HAVE I MENTIONED MY SEQUEL?

1702
01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:41.884
NOT ANOTHER ONE!

1703
01:13:44.388 --> 01:13:46.125
WHOO!

1704
01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:48.696
GUYS, I'M OUT OF HERE.

1705
01:13:57.381 --> 01:13:59.887
ANY OTHER BRILLIANT IDEAS?

1706
01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.209
THAT'S IT.

1707
01:14:11.242 --> 01:14:12.253
LINDSAY AND HARMONY
HAVE RIGGED THE WHALE


1708
01:14:12.277 --> 01:14:16.252
TO THROW PROTEST FLYERS
ALL OVER THE DANCE FLOOR.


1709
01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.356
THEY'LL RUIN EVERYTHING, BUT...

1710
01:14:18.389 --> 01:14:20.293
IF YOU RAT THEM OUT
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,


1711
01:14:20.327 --> 01:14:23.299
AND THEY TAKE THE FALL FOR IT,

1712
01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.168
YOU'LL BE A HERO.

1713
01:14:24.201 --> 01:14:28.109
YOU KNOW HOW FICKLE
THE LOCAL MARKET IS.


1714
01:14:28.143 --> 01:14:29.511
DO IT.

1715
01:14:31.951 --> 01:14:33.453
DO IT.

1716
01:14:34.021 --> 01:14:37.061
HARMONY, LINDSAY, STOP!

1717
01:14:39.465 --> 01:14:40.300
THAT'S MY GIRL.

1718
01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:43.806
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU.


1719
01:14:46.345 --> 01:14:47.281
I'M SORRY.

1720
01:14:47.314 --> 01:14:48.583
WHAT?

1721
01:14:48.616 --> 01:14:50.587
I'M SORRY TO EVERYONE.

1722
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.493
I'M SORRY IF I EMBARRASSED YOU,

1723
01:14:53.526 --> 01:14:55.230
OR INSULTED YOU, OR...

1724
01:14:55.263 --> 01:14:58.136
HURT YOU IN ANY WAY.

1725
01:14:59.305 --> 01:15:01.442
THAT WASN'T MY INTENTION.

1726
01:15:01.475 --> 01:15:02.979
NONE OF THIS WAS.

1727
01:15:03.013 --> 01:15:06.552
THAT WAS MY PERSONAL,
PRIVATE JOURNAL,


1728
01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:10.260
AND NO ONE WAS SUPPOSED
TO READ IT.


1729
01:15:12.664 --> 01:15:14.268
BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T
GIVE ME THE RIGHT


1730
01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.239
TO SAY THE THINGS THAT I DID.

1731
01:15:16.272 --> 01:15:18.009
NO ONE IS BLACK AND WHITE

1732
01:15:18.043 --> 01:15:19.387
LIKE THEY APPEAR
IN MY BOOK, I MEAN,


1733
01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:21.449
WE'RE ALL A LOT OF THINGS.

1734
01:15:21.482 --> 01:15:25.323
ALL UNIQUE AND SPECIAL
IN OUR OWN WAY.


1735
01:15:27.127 --> 01:15:28.572
AND WE ALL HAVE TALENTS,
INCLUDING MY BROTHER.


1736
01:15:28.596 --> 01:15:33.573
EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T
WANT ANYONE TO KNOW IT.


1737
01:15:33.606 --> 01:15:34.675
HE SHOULD.

1738
01:15:34.708 --> 01:15:36.345
SEE, AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS

1739
01:15:36.379 --> 01:15:39.451
THAT I SHOULD'VE
BEEN WRITING ABOUT.


1740
01:15:39.485 --> 01:15:40.687
HARMONY.

1741
01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.424
LINDSAY.

1742
01:15:42.457 --> 01:15:44.428
COME HERE.

1743
01:15:45.397 --> 01:15:46.099
I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW

1744
01:15:46.132 --> 01:15:47.969
WHO DID ALL OF THE WORK TONIGHT.

1745
01:15:48.003 --> 01:15:48.769
WHILE I WAS OFF

1746
01:15:48.803 --> 01:15:51.175
PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY
I WASN'T,


1747
01:15:51.209 --> 01:15:53.313
THESE TWO WORKED
ABOVE AND BEYOND


1748
01:15:53.346 --> 01:15:54.348
WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE

1749
01:15:54.381 --> 01:15:57.621
TO MAKE THIS
DEEP BLUE SEE DANCE
SO SPECTACULAR.


1750
01:16:01.562 --> 01:16:02.497
THESE...

1751
01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:04.301
ARE FOR YOU.

1752
01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:08.043
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

1753
01:16:10.347 --> 01:16:13.219
AND I HAVE ANOTHER
PRESENT FOR YOU.


1754
01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:16.425
JAMIE, STOP!

1755
01:16:16.459 --> 01:16:17.661
IF YOU PULL THAT ROPE,

1756
01:16:17.694 --> 01:16:18.705
YOU'LL BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING.

1757
01:16:18.729 --> 01:16:20.433
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

1758
01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:22.404
SOMETHING I SHOULD'VE DONE
A LONG TIME AGO.


1759
01:16:22.437 --> 01:16:25.443
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE POWER, IS, I DO.


1760
01:16:25.477 --> 01:16:28.516
SAVE THE WHALES!

1761
01:16:41.575 --> 01:16:44.115
SHE'S NOT GETTING AWAY
WITH THIS.


1762
01:16:51.129 --> 01:16:52.764
NO!!!!

1763
01:16:58.376 --> 01:16:59.411
FRIENDS?

1764
01:16:59.445 --> 01:17:00.147
FRIENDS.

1765
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:00.914
NOW, WHERE'S CONNOR?

1766
01:17:00.948 --> 01:17:03.386
HE DITCHED WHEN YOU
WERE ON STAGE.


1767
01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:05.357
I HAVE TO FIND HIM.

1768
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:07.494
IT'S ALL RIGHT. DON'T...

1769
01:17:07.527 --> 01:17:08.763
OH!

1770
01:17:21.755 --> 01:17:23.826
CONNOR!

1771
01:17:25.964 --> 01:17:27.267
WHAT DOES SHE WANT NOW?

1772
01:17:27.301 --> 01:17:30.607
IT'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

1773
01:17:37.687 --> 01:17:39.658
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

1774
01:17:39.691 --> 01:17:41.362
WELL...

1775
01:17:41.395 --> 01:17:43.499
YOU FOUND ME.

1776
01:17:44.568 --> 01:17:45.938
HI.

1777
01:17:47.841 --> 01:17:52.217
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY
I'VE BEEN SUCH
A JERK LATELY.


1778
01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:55.623
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S COME OVER ME.


1779
01:17:56.525 --> 01:17:58.629
OR MAYBE I DO.

1780
01:17:58.663 --> 01:18:02.404
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
I NEVER LIKED MARCO.


1781
01:18:02.437 --> 01:18:03.339
I JUST LIKED HIS POETRY,

1782
01:18:03.373 --> 01:18:06.345
AND NOW I FIND OUT
THAT IT WASN'T
EVEN HIM.


1783
01:18:07.982 --> 01:18:09.618
IT WAS YOU.

1784
01:18:11.789 --> 01:18:13.359
I WIMPED OUT.

1785
01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:16.465
I SHOULD'VE JUST ASKED YOU
TO THE DANCE.


1786
01:18:24.648 --> 01:18:26.819
ABOUT THAT DANCE.

1787
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:31.028
WAY TO GO, SQUIRT.

1788
01:18:38.509 --> 01:18:39.912
MISS BARTLETT.

1789
01:18:39.946 --> 01:18:41.883
ABOUT YOUR DISPLAY...

1790
01:18:41.916 --> 01:18:42.751
YES, MA'AM.

1791
01:18:42.784 --> 01:18:45.323
I WANT A WORD WITH YOU.

1792
01:18:48.997 --> 01:18:51.502
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1793
01:18:51.535 --> 01:18:52.905
OH...

1794
01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:58.549
MONDAY.

1795
01:19:00.119 --> 01:19:01.655
DON'T WORRY, SIS.

1796
01:19:01.689 --> 01:19:04.361
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S BEEN A DORK LATELY.


1797
01:19:04.395 --> 01:19:05.763
THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.

1798
01:19:12.043 --> 01:19:15.750
* YOU SAID YOUR TIME
WAS RUNNING OUT *


1799
01:19:15.783 --> 01:19:18.789
* YOU'RE FAR FROM WHERE
YOU WANT TO BE *


1800
01:19:18.823 --> 01:19:23.399
* YOUR HANGING IN
THE LOST AND FOUND *


1801
01:19:23.433 --> 01:19:25.470

WITH EVERYTHING *


1802
01:19:25.503 --> 01:19:29.411
* AND WHEN YOU NEED SOMEONE TO *

1803
01:19:29.445 --> 01:19:31.883
* LEAN ON

1804
01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:36.191
* I WILL BE AROUND

1805
01:19:36.224 --> 01:19:38.729
* WHEN YOU THINK IT'S OVER

1806
01:19:38.763 --> 01:19:43.105
* I WON'T LET YOU DOWN

1807
01:19:43.138 --> 01:19:44.675
* IF YOUR LUCK RUNS OUT

1808
01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:47.847
* AND WHEN IT FEELS LIKE
LIFE IS HOLDING YOU DOWN *


1809
01:19:47.882 --> 01:19:51.722
* WHENEVER YOU NEED ME,
I WILL BE AROUND *


1810
01:19:51.755 --> 01:19:58.135
* DON'T WORRY,
THIS WON'T LAST FOREVER *


1811
01:19:58.168 --> 01:20:00.673
* YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT

1812
01:20:00.707 --> 01:20:05.049
* BETTER LATE THAN NEVER

1813
01:20:05.082 --> 01:20:09.658
* I WILL BE AROUND

1814
01:20:09.691 --> 01:20:11.662
* WHEN YOU THINK IT'S OVER

1815
01:20:11.695 --> 01:20:16.171
* I WON'T LET YOU DOWN

1816
01:20:16.204 --> 01:20:19.645

01:20:26.592 --> 01:20:31.635

1820
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:32.737
* IF YOUR LUCK RUNS OUT

1821
01:20:32.771 --> 01:20:34.641

1822
01:20:34.675 --> 01:20:36.779

1823
01:20:36.812 --> 01:20:39.618

1824
01:20:39.651 --> 01:20:41.789

01:20:41.822 --> 01:20:44.761

1826
01:21:18.729 --> 01:21:19.364
MOM.

1827
01:21:19.397 --> 01:21:22.036
DAD. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

1828
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:25.777
I BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS
FOR PIZZA.


1829
01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:30.787

1830

1831
01:21:33.292 --> 01:21:35.697
WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

1832
01:21:36.398 --> 01:21:38.703
I GOTTA GET COOKING.

1833
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:13.138
ANYMORE SPINACH PIZZA?

1834
01:22:13.172 --> 01:22:14.240
I DIDN'T MAKE SPINACH.

1835
01:22:14.274 --> 01:22:18.048
WHATEVER IT WAS,
EVERYBODY WANTS MORE.


1836
01:22:18.082 --> 01:22:19.818
SEAWEED?

1837
01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:22.824
UH

01:22:22.858 --> 01:22:24.962
NO! YOUR GOOD.

1839
01:22:24.996 --> 01:22:26.131
I THINK THIS COULD BE IT.

1840
01:22:26.164 --> 01:22:27.400
LISTEN TO THOSE KIDS.

1841
01:22:27.433 --> 01:22:28.836
