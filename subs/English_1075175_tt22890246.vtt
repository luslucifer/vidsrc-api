00:35:20.963 --> 00:35:22.505
Gorgeous, pet!

624
00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.255
Fuck!

625
00:35:29.547 --> 00:35:31.588
Why so early?

626
00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:34.505
I don't remember anything at all.

627
00:35:36.255 --> 00:35:37.797
Is Taz at theirs?

628
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.338
Must be.

629
00:35:44.005 --> 00:35:45.130
Hm.

630
00:35:53.755 --> 00:35:56.130
[Skye] Eating's cheating, babe.

631
00:35:58.005 --> 00:35:59.630
Oh, my God, please stop.

632
00:35:59.755 --> 00:36:01.672
You're going to make me sick again.

633
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.338
What, you want some?

634
00:36:07.338 --> 00:36:09.380
Oi, do us a favour
and wake Tara up.


635
00:36:09.505 --> 00:36:11.422
Me and her have got
some unfinished business.


636
00:36:11.588 --> 00:36:14.713
We all know how you finish
your business now, Badger.


637
00:36:15.755 --> 00:36:17.213
[Paige] You lot up for pool?

638
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.797
- [Paddy] Yeah.
- Em?


639
00:36:20.297 --> 00:36:22.088
- Yeah.
- Worst bit is, yeah,


640
00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:23.463
I've got no memory of it.

641
00:36:24.297 --> 00:36:27.213
Probably the greatest thing to ever
happen to me in my whole entire life.


642
00:36:27.255 --> 00:36:28.672
No memory.

643
00:36:29.422 --> 00:36:31.130
[Em] That was the best thing?

644
00:36:31.505 --> 00:36:33.255
[Paige] Hopefully,
them girls feel the same.


645
00:36:33.297 --> 00:36:35.005
Yeah, I hope
they don't remember it either.


646
00:36:36.005 --> 00:36:38.255
Your life sounds proper shit.

647
00:36:39.047 --> 00:36:40.255
[Paddy] Rinsed.

648
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.213
[Paige] Oi! Last night
were crazy, you know?


649
00:36:42.338 --> 00:36:44.297
Taz, come out here! Mush!

650
00:36:44.338 --> 00:36:46.797
[Skye] Stop screaming, you lunatic.

651
00:36:47.422 --> 00:36:49.172
Well, if you won't get her
out here...


652
00:36:50.505 --> 00:36:52.088
She's with you, no?

653
00:36:52.172 --> 00:36:53.713
Yeah! Ain't she at yours?

654
00:36:53.755 --> 00:36:55.547
No, why would she be here?

655
00:36:56.338 --> 00:36:57.922
Well, she came back with you.

656
00:36:58.713 --> 00:37:00.505
She not at yours?

657
00:37:01.088 --> 00:37:03.838
[Em] He's joking about.
Just bring her out.


658
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.213
On my Mum's life, 
I'm not joking.

659
00:37:06.463 --> 00:37:08.547
[Tense hum]

660
00:37:08.797 --> 00:37:10.422
[Dance music continues
in the background]


661
00:37:11.172 --> 00:37:12.547
Check your phone.

662
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.005
She would've said something.

663
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.380
This is typical Tara behaviour.

664
00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:21.630
She's always on one.

665
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.630
See, last seen in the apartment, now.

666
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.088
Damn!

667
00:37:35.422 --> 00:37:37.088
I guess girl got laid.

668
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:39.338
[Hum intensifies]

669
00:37:41.297 --> 00:37:43.838
[Em] What she doing
leaving her phone here?


670
00:37:45.588 --> 00:37:47.630
- Why are you being weird?
- I'm not.


671
00:37:50.505 --> 00:37:53.588
- Oi, just look proper, yeah?
- Yeah, check.


672
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.422
Mate, I'd know if she came here.

673
00:37:55.672 --> 00:37:57.463
[Skye] She's definitely still on it.

674
00:38:07.005 --> 00:38:08.630
I don't like it.

675
00:38:09.255 --> 00:38:10.672
Just chill out.

676
00:38:12.297 --> 00:38:15.672
It's nothing major, is it?
Just fucking stop panicking.


677
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.922
[Paddy] Should have moved quicker, bro.

678
00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:21.088
Don't you get jealous, you.
It doesn't suit you.


679
00:38:24.755 --> 00:38:26.838
- What are you trying to get at?
- [Paddy chuckles]


680
00:38:30.422 --> 00:38:31.838
Where is she, then?

681
00:38:32.088 --> 00:38:34.088
- You chat shit.
- I don't know.


682
00:38:35.255 --> 00:38:37.880
I can't just sit here.
I'm going to talk to reception, okay?


683
00:38:45.547 --> 00:38:47.297
[Paige shouts] See you
down the pool, yeah?


684
00:38:47.338 --> 00:38:49.088
Come on, boys, let's go.

685
00:38:49.672 --> 00:38:51.047
[Paddy] Badger, you coming?

686
00:38:58.213 --> 00:38:59.547
Oi!

687
00:39:08.463 --> 00:39:10.297
Do you want to come and chill here?

688
00:39:13.838 --> 00:39:15.838
[Eerie hum;
Insects chirp]


689
00:39:32.463 --> 00:39:34.463
[Indistinct chatter;
Dance music]


690
00:39:38.047 --> 00:39:40.172
I'm so proud of Tara, man.

691
00:39:43.505 --> 00:39:44.838
Proud?

692
00:39:48.797 --> 00:39:50.755
I bet she's finally...

693
00:39:55.088 --> 00:39:57.005
She's wanted to for so long.

694
00:40:00.255 --> 00:40:01.963
What are you on about?

695
00:40:07.005 --> 00:40:09.047
She's a massive virgin, mate.

696
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.880
[Eerie Hum]

697
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:25.463
Do you think she's all right?

698
00:40:27.047 --> 00:40:29.297
Mate, she's having
the time of her life.


699
00:40:36.922 --> 00:40:38.505
Are you jealous?

700
00:40:40.463 --> 00:40:42.922
[Badger] No, it's...
it's not that, it's just...


701
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.797
Well, we could go looking for her.

702
00:40:51.005 --> 00:40:52.880
[Badger] Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

703
00:41:07.588 --> 00:41:09.588
[Eerie hum intensifies]

704
00:41:11.505 --> 00:41:13.505
[Hum;
Muffled, echoed voices]


705
00:41:13.797 --> 00:41:15.547
[Boy] Ho, ho, this
one's a lucky boy, eh?

706
00:41:17.963 --> 00:41:19.172
Let's go darling!

707
00:41:19.213 --> 00:41:20.630
Go on, deep throat him.

708
00:41:21.547 --> 00:41:22.922
Jesus Christ, she's gagging.

709
00:41:25.797 --> 00:41:26.838
[Passer-by] Hi darling.

710
00:41:29.838 --> 00:41:32.338
[Hum continues;
Distorted, muffled dance music]


711
00:41:48.422 --> 00:41:49.838
- [Music subsides]
- [Paddy] All right, you?


712
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.505
- Paddy!
- What are you doing?


713
00:41:51.547 --> 00:41:53.797
Um... not going home.

714
00:41:54.297 --> 00:41:56.422
Is it past your bedtime already?

715
00:41:57.422 --> 00:41:58.963
Where's everyone else?

716
00:41:59.713 --> 00:42:01.255
Still going, I think.

717
00:42:01.297 --> 00:42:03.797
Yeah? Oh, come on,
you can't go to bed.


718
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.297
Me and you are always
last ones standing.


719
00:42:06.672 --> 00:42:08.922
You're not going leave me
on my own, are you?


720
00:42:11.338 --> 00:42:12.755
We go to beach?

721
00:42:14.755 --> 00:42:16.963
Come on! I know you want to.

722
00:42:18.088 --> 00:42:19.755
Come on!

723
00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.130
- Sit there.
- Here?


724
00:42:33.755 --> 00:42:35.797
You don't fancy the strip, then, no?

725
00:42:35.838 --> 00:42:37.797
- No.
- Why?


726
00:42:38.755 --> 00:42:40.297
I don't know.

727
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.547
[Tara] Don't you think it's mad how, like,

728
00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.213
sand just gets everywhere?

729
00:42:48.755 --> 00:42:50.255
No, we're on a beach.

730
00:42:51.713 --> 00:42:53.172
What are you on about?

731
00:42:53.213 --> 00:42:56.380
Yeah but, it just gets everywhere.

732
00:43:05.755 --> 00:43:08.630
I've not noticed it before,
but you're proper beautiful, you know?


733
00:43:15.838 --> 00:43:19.505
Some kind of compliment
in there somewhere.


734
00:43:21.713 --> 00:43:23.713
You're into our lad, though,
aren't you?


735
00:43:29.505 --> 00:43:31.505
So, what are you into, then?

736
00:43:34.922 --> 00:43:36.005
Hmm...

737
00:43:37.463 --> 00:43:40.463
Pasta and cheesy chips.

738
00:43:41.963 --> 00:43:44.047
You're fucking jokes, you!

739
00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:55.630
Oi, let's go skinny dipping.

740
00:43:55.797 --> 00:43:56.963
- No.
- Why?


741
00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.922
- 'Cause it's so cold.
- Come on! Come on!


742
00:43:58.963 --> 00:44:00.755
Paddy, no! No!

743
00:44:00.963 --> 00:44:03.713
Paddy, no! I don't want to!
Put me down!


744
00:44:03.755 --> 00:44:05.713
- [Paddy laughs]
- Paddy! No!


745
00:44:05.922 --> 00:44:08.505
No! Put me down!

746
00:44:08.547 --> 00:44:10.047
[She shivers]

747
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.880
- It's all right once you're in it!
- It's not, alright at all Paddy.


748
00:44:12.922 --> 00:44:14.088
It's fucking freezing!

749
00:44:14.505 --> 00:44:16.130
Come here.

750
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:18.213
Come here.

751
00:44:22.047 --> 00:44:24.005
You're going to lose all your teeth.

752
00:44:26.088 --> 00:44:27.505
Come here.

753
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.963
What you laughing at?

754
00:44:35.338 --> 00:44:37.047
Paddy, stop!

755
00:44:37.172 --> 00:44:39.255
- What?
- Stop.


756
00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.047
All right, I won't touch you.

757
00:44:51.755 --> 00:44:53.630
No!

758
00:44:53.963 --> 00:44:55.338
- Come here.
- What?


759
00:44:55.547 --> 00:44:56.838
I'm cold!

760
00:44:59.338 --> 00:45:02.297
I think it's a bit unfair how it don't
work both ways, though, really.


761
00:45:02.422 --> 00:45:04.130
I'm cold.

762
00:45:07.297 --> 00:45:08.755
[Paddy] Come on, then.

763
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.172
[Slap]

764
00:45:20.297 --> 00:45:21.797
[He laughs]

765
00:45:21.963 --> 00:45:23.755
Weren't me, boss!

766
00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.755
What?

767
00:45:26.047 --> 00:45:28.713
I can't help it when it's wiggling
in front of me like that, can I?


768
00:45:30.213 --> 00:45:31.838
What are you so uptight for?

769
00:45:32.005 --> 00:45:33.297
I'm not.

770
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:36.005
I thought you were the fun one.

771
00:45:36.755 --> 00:45:38.630
- Are you cold?
- Yes.


772
00:45:39.588 --> 00:45:40.880
Come on.

773
00:45:42.047 --> 00:45:43.672
Wet clothes make you colder.

774
00:45:57.463 --> 00:46:00.172
Chill out, it's not like
I'm asking you to marry me, is it?


775
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:04.505
What do you mean,
this isn't the wedding?


776
00:46:16.713 --> 00:46:18.005
[Paddy] Yeah?

777
00:46:26.713 --> 00:46:28.130
Yeah?

778
00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.588
[She whispers] Yeah.

00:59:30.005 --> 00:59:32.588

946
00:59:33.713 --> 00:59:36.463
- Catch.
- Fucking hell. Sorry, love.


947
00:59:36.713 --> 00:59:38.255
[Gemma] I know what a Libra looks like

948
00:59:38.588 --> 00:59:39.713
Where's them balloons then?

949
00:59:40.005 --> 00:59:41.838
[Badger] Yeah, come on,
let's go out for a fag.


950
00:59:41.922 --> 00:59:43.130
[Gemma] It's too warm in here.

951

[Dance music on radio]

You good?

Imagine, yeah,
this genius got ten As!


957
01:00:03.922 --> 01:00:06.463
Let's get fucked up!

958
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:11.213
Oi, shut up!
You did so fucking well.


959
01:00:11.338 --> 01:00:13.922
- So well!
- Wait, you looked?


960
01:00:14.047 --> 01:00:16.213
Yeah. Taz, I persuaded her, innit?

961
01:00:16.838 --> 01:00:19.672
I thought you said
you weren't going to check results.


962
01:00:19.797 --> 01:00:22.922
She might even be able
to come with me next year.


963
01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:27.963
[Em] Don't be sad, Taz.

964
01:00:28.005 --> 01:00:29.797
Whatever you do,
you're going to be great.


965
01:00:29.922 --> 01:00:32.505
[Gemma] When are we going?

966
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:34.880
- [Leah] Are we going soon?
- [Em] Come on, Taz.


967
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:39.047
Oh, it's going be so fun.

We got to keep an eye on Em tonight.
She's already looking fucked.


970
01:00:55.338 --> 01:00:57.963
We're not going to babysit her, though.

971
01:00:58.088 --> 01:01:00.963
Like, it's results night,
she's worked for it.


972
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.797
Pretty sure you don't need ten As
to open a restaurant anyway.


973
01:01:05.588 --> 01:01:07.297
I'll get you on front desk.

974
01:01:07.547 --> 01:01:09.963
What restaurant have you been to
what has a front desk?


975
01:01:10.088 --> 01:01:12.672
Two coats? Any bags?
Yeah, that's four pounds!


976
01:01:12.797 --> 01:01:15.672
That's not front desk,
that's a cloakroom!


977
01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:18.213
I'm not going to be working
on a cloakroom.


978
01:01:18.463 --> 01:01:21.047
Yeah, I'm not sure you've got
much choice at this point.


979
01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.797
Nah, come on.

980
01:01:28.755 --> 01:01:30.005
I'm joking.

981
01:01:32.463 --> 01:01:34.922
I would be kinda jokes
in a cloakroom, though.


982
01:01:40.005 --> 01:01:42.047
So what, is Paddy good, then?

983
01:01:46.213 --> 01:01:47.630
Yeah, I guess.

984
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:51.005
Like, he knew
what he was doing, innit?


985
01:01:53.422 --> 01:01:55.130
Yeah, he looks like it.

986
01:01:57.672 --> 01:01:59.130
Did he, like...

987
01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.213
pick you up and throw you
about and that?


988
01:02:03.838 --> 01:02:05.255
Kind of.

989
01:02:06.588 --> 01:02:08.463
Like, he's strong.

990
01:02:11.338 --> 01:02:14.047
Then you should deffo go
for round two with him.

You all right?

Yeah, you all right?

996
01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:42.547
Sorry about last night.
I was trashed.


997
01:02:43.505 --> 01:02:45.130
What do you mean?

998
01:02:49.088 --> 01:02:50.588
It's fine.
