1
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.060
到洛杉磯來吧!
Come to Los Angeles.


2
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.990
這兒陽光普照
The sun shines bright.


3
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.490
海灘寬廣迷人
The beaches are wide and inviting.


4
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.830
橘子園一望無際
And the orange groves stretch as far as the eye can see.


5
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.660
就業機會多多
There are jobs aplenty.


6
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.580
洛 城 機 密

7
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.360
土地價格低
Land is cheap.


8
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.940
每個人都可以擁有自己的房子
Every workingman can have his own house.


9
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.640
每棟房子都住著快樂的一家人
And inside every house, a happy all-American family.


10
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.470
你可以享有這一切
You can have all this.


11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.980
更棒是
And who knows?


12
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.080
或許你會被星探挖掘
You could even be discovered


13
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.690
一舉成為大明星
become a movie star,


14
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.680
或碰上大明星
or at least see one.


15
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.480
洛杉磯一切都很好
Life is good in Los Angeles.


16
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.360
有如人間天堂一般
It's paradise on earth.


17
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.990
以上說法純屬推銷廣告
That's what they tell you, anyway.


18
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.090
透過影視媒體
Because they're selling an image.


19
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.000
加強這種好印象
They're selling it through movies, radio and television.


20
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.900
就像是熱門連續劇《警網群英》
In the hit show, Badge of Honor,


21
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.030
洛城警探個個神勇非凡
the L.A. cops walk on water


22
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.640
所有歹徒聞風喪膽
as they keep the city clean of crooks.


23
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.250
沒錯  你會覺得這兒簡直是伊甸園一般
You'd think this place was the Garden of Eden.


24
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.680
但即使是天堂  也會有敗類
But there's trouble in paradise


25
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.550
有個敗類叫麥爾哈里斯·柯漢
and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,


26
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.480
愛戴他的人則稱呼他 米奇C
Mickey C, to his fans.


27
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.110
一個使洛城蒙羞的人物
Local L.A. color to the nth degree.


28
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.820
以及他的頭號保鏢
And his number one bodyguard


29
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.590
錢寧史當·巴那多
Johnny Stompanato.


30
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.750
米奇是洛城黑社會的總把子
Mickey C's the head of organized crime in these parts.


31
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.890
旗下行業淫毒偷搶騙一應俱全
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.


32
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.470
一年總得幹掉十來個人
He kills a dozen people a year.


33
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.800
而且手法永遠不落俗套
And the dapper little gent does it in style.


34
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.000
每次他的照片一上頭版
And every time his picture's on the front page


35
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.240
就使得洛城的形象大為受損
it's a black eye for the image of Los Angeles.


36
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.870
這種知法犯法的黑道血拼
Because how can organized crime exist


37
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.380
怎能發生在警力雄厚的洛城?
in the city with the best police force in the world?


38
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.980
該是有人出手的時候了
Something has to be done.


39
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.320
只不過手法無啥新意
But nothing too original


40
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.450
誰叫這裏是專炒冷飯的好萊塢
because, hey, this is Hollywood.


41
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.690
米奇·柯漢的下場就像其它教父
What worked for Al Capone would work for the Mickster.


42
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.460
柯漢先生你被捕了
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.


43
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.360
罪名是"逃漏綜合所得稅"
Nonpayment of federal income tax.


44
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.090
可是情況並未好轉
But all is not well.


45
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.530
把米奇送進牢裏  使得總把子的位子空出來了
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum.


46
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.480
早晚總會有個不怕死的想接手所有地盤
And it's only a matter of time


47
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.340
想要取而代之
before someone with balls of brass tries to fill it.


48
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.710
敬告各位親愛的讀者
"Remember, dear readers


49
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.370
第一手的獨家秘聞  絕對機密!

50

51
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.050
米奇黑牢秘聞  好萊塢女同性戀

52
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.890
警員 巴德·懷特

53
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.070
你跟聖誕老公公一樣全照著那張名單
You're like Santa Claus with that list.


54
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.710
只不過在你名單上的全是些爛人!
Except everyone on it's been naughty.


55
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.680
他才剛出獄半個月
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.


56
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.940
以後再處理吧
Leave it for later.


57
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.520
我們還得去替大伙買酒呢
We've got to pick up the booze and get it to the station.


58
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.460
好萊塢分局  這裏是6A7車
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.


59
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.590
請總局派車到常春路4216號
Have Central send a prowler to 4216 Evergreen.


60
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.560
有假釋犯因家庭糾紛出手傷人
Parole violation: assault arising from a family dispute.


61
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.160
我們不會留在現場
We won't be here. They'll see him.


62
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.300
別哭了
Quit whining!


63
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.670
別一天到晚哭哭啼啼的
Quit whining all the time! It makes me sick!


64
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.140
搞得我煩死了  閉嘴!
Shut up!


65
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.870
你是誰啊?
Who the hell are you?


66
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.520
聖誕夜的昔日鬼魂
The ghost of Christmas past.


67
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.440
換個男的跟你玩玩吧!
Dance with a man for a change?


68
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.200
你是哪兒來的癟三?
What are you, a smart ass?


69
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.650
你關個一年半就可以出來了
You could be out in a year or half


70
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.950
我會請人在牢裏好好照顧你
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.


71
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.420
只要你敢再碰她
You touch her again,


72
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.360
我會告你強姦未成年少女
I'll have you violated on a kiddies rapper beef.


73
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.400
想知道牢裏怎麼照顧這種人?
You know what they do to kiddies rappers in Quentin.


74
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.340
你有地方可以去嗎?
You have someplace you can go?


75
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.700
去找個地方安頓下來
Go get yourself fixed up.


76
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.680
聖誕快樂
Merry Christmas.


77
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.750
聖誕快樂  夫人
Merry Christmas, ma'am.


78
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.380
走吧!
Let's go,Bud.


79
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.850
大夥一定在等我們了
The guys will be waiting.


80
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.090
傑克·文生 警官

81
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.320
你在警網群英扮演什麼角色?
What do you do on Badge of Honor?


82
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.230
我是技術顧問
I'm the technical advisor.


83
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.200
我教男主角怎麼演才會像警察
I teach Brett Chase how to walk and talk like a cop.


84
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.640
可是他演得並不像你
Brett Chase doesn't walk and talk like you.


85
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.230
他演的是電視精華版
That's because he's the television version.


86
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.880
美國人暫時還受不了真實版
America isn't ready for the real me.


87
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.680
你真是逮捕勞勃米契的人?
Is it true you're the one who arrested Bob Mitchum?


88
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.380
那些演員很喜歡演員警
Badge of Honor guys pretend.


89
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.480
當真的警察一定很刺激吧!
But being the real thing must be a thrill.


90
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.820
我們何不找個安靜的地方
Why don't we go someplace quiet?


91
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.150
聽聽我如何破案的故事
I'll give you the lowdown on Mitchum.


92

大文 傑克·文生
Big V.Jack Vincennes.


93
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.050
可以讓給我嗎?  當然可以
-May I have this dance? -Of course.


94
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.630
凱倫  這位是噓噓雜誌的席德哈金斯
This is Sid Hudgens with Hush-Hush magazine.


95
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.060
你好! 凱倫
Hello, Karen.


96
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.430
好你個頭
Hello yourself.


97
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.970
怎麼回事啊?
What's that about?


98
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.660
我們有篇好萊塢女同性戀的報導
We did a piece, "Ingenue Dikes in Hollywood."


99
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.500
提到了她的名字
Her name got mentioned.


100
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.040
喂  傑克
Jackie-boy


101
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.770
我有個朋友賣了些大麻給麥特·雷諾
a friend just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.


102
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.370
他目前在泰米喬登家裏
He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan.


103
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.610
對不起!我剛剛沒注意聽
Sorry, I lost you for a second, Sid.


104
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.190
大都會影業旗下的兩位演員
Contract players, Metro.


105
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.920
你逮捕他們  我下一期雜誌就好好捧捧你
You pinch them, I do a nice feature next issue.


106
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.360
照樣外加五十元現金
Plus the usual $50 cash.


107
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.480
不行  這次得多加五十才行
No, I need another $50.


108
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.820
兩名警察各二十元
Two $20's for two patrolmen,


109
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.360
剩下十元給好萊塢分局的值日警官
a dime for the Hollywood Station watch commander.


110
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.990
傑克  聖誕夜嘛
Jackie, it's Christmas.


111
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.860
不  不是  是非法持有大麻
No, it's not. It's felony possession of marijuana.


112
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.900
事實上是發行量突破三萬六  而且一路往上竄升
Actually, it's circulation 36,000 and climbing.


113
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.810
沒有人知道會紅到什麼地步
There's no telling where this will go.


114
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.170
電台、電視都有可能
Radio, television.


115
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.540
只要把大眾求知的胃口養大了
Once you whet the public's appetite for the truth,


116
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.550
自然鴻運當頭  擋都擋不住
the sky's the limit.


117
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.910
艾德·艾斯利 警官

118
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.320
艾德·艾斯利警官
Sergeant Ed Exley,


119
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.320
傳奇英雄普瑞斯頓·艾斯利之子
son of the legendary Preston Exley.


120
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.080
你一定覺得很難趕得上他吧?
Must be a hard act to follow.


121
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.080
你為什麼不另去闖一片天地?
Why not make a mark somewhere else?


122
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.060
為什麼還要當警察呢?
Why become a cop, Ed?


123
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.100
我喜歡幫助人
I like to help people.


124
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.000
聽說今晚有兩名警察遭到攻擊
We heard 2 officers were assaulted this evening.


125
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.500
你對此有什麼看法?
-What do you think about that?


126
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.000
幹這一行本來就有危險的
-Goes with the job.


127
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.070
不過我看過報告了
I took the report.


128
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.140
他們沒事了
Luckily, they're okay.


129
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.110
你現在就當值勤官不會太年輕嗎?
Aren't you young to be watch commander?


130
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.470
只有今晚而已
It's only tonight.


131
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.380
局裏已婚的都放團圓假了
The married men have Christmas Eve off.


132
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.850
這句話很適合做我的開場白
That's a good lead for the story.


133
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.620
聖誕快樂!長官
Merry Christmas, Captain.


134
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.190
史密斯組長別那麼一板一眼的  保比
-Captain Smith. -Drop the formalities, Bobby.


135
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.310
聖誕節嘛!
-It's Christmas


136
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.390
叫我杜德利就好了
Eve, call me Dudley.


137
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.080
我已經為報導擬好標題了
-I came up with a title for the story.


138
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.290
我想用"與洛城警局共渡平安夜 "
I'm calling it "Silent Night with the LAPD."


139
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.790
非常好嘛!
That's grand.


140
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.920
別忘了!
Now remember, Bobby, that's "Smith."


141
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.060
我姓史密斯  一個S
With an "S."


142
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.970
謝謝你們!  謝謝!
Thank you, gentlemen.


143
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.040
聖誕快樂!  謝謝!
Merry Christmas.


144
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.660
悠著點  小伙子
Hold on there, lads.


145
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.370
聖誕快樂
Merry Christmas.


146
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.380
我看過考試的結果了
I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.


147
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.540
你在23人中名列榜首
First out of 23.


148
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.020
你打算調到哪兒?
What'll it be, then?


149
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.520
巡邏  政風  還是哪兒?
Patrol Division? Internal Affairs? What?


150
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.520
我想到刑事局來
I was thinking Detective Bureau.


151
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.890
埃德蒙  你是權謀型的人物
Edmund you're a political animal.


152
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.360
你能洞悉人性的弱點
You have the eye for human weakness,


153
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.060
卻沒有硬漢的膽識
but not the stomach.


154
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.600
你錯了  長官
You're wrong, sir.


155
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.000
對一個你明知有罪的人  你願意用栽贓的方式
Would you be willing to plant evidence on a suspect you knew to be guilty


156
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.600
以確保法院判他有罪嗎?
in order to insure an indictment?


157
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.020
這些我們以前談過了
-We've been over this.


158
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:03.770
願不願意?
-Yes or no?


159
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.710
不願意
No.


160
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.930
你願意用嚴刑拷打的方式讓犯人招供嗎?
Would you beat a confession out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?


161
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.380
不願意
No.


162
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.210
你會從背後射殺一個頑劣的罪犯
Would you shoot a hardened criminal in the back


163
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.790
以免律師為他脫罪?
in order to offset the chance that some lawyer--


164
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.450
不會
No.


165
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.720
那看在上帝的份上  別干刑警
Then for the love of God don't be a detective.


166
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.160
去你不用做出這種事的地方
Work where you don't have to make those kind of choices.


167
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.390
杜德利  我知道你是一片好意
Dudley, I know you mean well


168
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.970
可是我不見得要學你或者是我父親
but I don't need to do it the way you did or my father.


169
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.870
那至少把你的眼鏡拿掉吧
At least get rid of the glasses.


170
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.940
我想不出來局裏有誰戴眼鏡的
I can't think of a man on the Bureau who wears them.


171
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.020
哪天我被搶了 你們最好快點來
If I get held up, you guys better be here.


172
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.020
嗨  尼克
Hi, Nick.


173
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.960
替我送些酒到家裏去
I need a delivery.


174
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.690
琴酒、蘭姆、威士忌各一箱
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.


175
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.360
聽來好像是很盛大的派對
Sounds like a hell of a party.


176
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.490
馬上就好
Be right with you.


177
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.520
聖誕快樂
Merry Christmas.


178
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.180
祝你聖誕快樂  警察先生
Merry Christmas to you, officer.


179
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.690
一眼就看出來啦
That obvious?


180
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.930
就寫在你的額頭上
It's practically stamped on your forehead.


181
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.590
你的酒
There you go.


182
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.800
去看看他有什麼事  巴茲
See what he wants, Buzz.


183
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.270
喂  閃一邊去好不好?
Get lost, why don't you?


184
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.550
趴下  頭低下去
Down! Get your fucking head down.


185
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.990
我有執照的
I got a license for that.


186
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.890
少來了  我以前也是警察
Cut me some slack. I used to be a cop.


187
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.330
李蘭·米克斯  沒聽說過
" Leland Meeks." Never heard of you.


188
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.830
大伙都叫我巴茲
They call me Buzz.


189
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.800
我才不管大伙叫你什麼
I don't give a rat's ass what they call you.


190
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.100
頭低下去
Keep your head down.


191
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.500
別亂動  巴茲
And stay thereBuzz.


192
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.940
你沒事吧?
You okay?


193
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.270
她很好
She's fine.


194
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.970
我不是在問你
I'm not asking you, sir.


195
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.980
有人打你嗎?
Somebody hit you?


196
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.950
事情不是你想的那樣
It's not what you think.


197
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.550
那事情是怎樣的?
What is it, then?


198
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.420
你誤會了  先生  我很好的
You got the wrong idea, mister. I'm fine.


199
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.520
但是謝謝你的關心
But it's nice to know you care.


200
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.130
小心開車
Drive safely.


201
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.910
怎麼回事?
What's going on?


202
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.310
你認識他嗎?
You know him?


203
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.150
見過幾次
Yeah, I've seen him around.


204
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.520
他以前是警察
He used to be a cop.


205
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.000
屋內沒開燈  他們在聖誕樹下鬧翻天了
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.


206
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.700
相機擺這兒
Put your camera right there.


207
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.600
我出來以後  會走到這兒來
When I walk out, I'll stop here.


208
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.330
你就用首映會場做背景照一張
Get the movie premiere in the background.


209
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.940
我喜歡
I like it.


210
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.340
首映會場上巨星吸大麻被捕
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."


211
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.310
我走出來的時候可別用閃光燈照我
When I walk out, I don't want your floodlights in my eyes.


212
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.180
沒問題!  聽到了沒有?
Consider it done. You hear that, Chip?


213
00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.310
好了  走吧
Come on.


214
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.850
低一點  開燈
Go! Pop them!


215
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.420
不許動  我是警察
Freeze! Police!


216
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.900
快點快走
Come on. Come on, let's go.


217
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.060
我老婆孩子明天就要來了
My family's coming in--


218
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.180
好好當個聖誕禮物吧
-It'll be a nice Christmas gift.


219
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.060
你好  泰米
-Hi, Tammy.


220
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.000
你好  麥特
-Hi, Matt.


221
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.820
看這邊  轉過來
Right over here.


222
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.140
等一下  行了
-Just turn. -Hold it. Got it!


223
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.670
"首映場上巨星吸大麻被捕 "
-The Movie Premiere Pot Bust!


224
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.300
把他們帶到好萊塢分局去
-Take them in.


225
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.710
我去搜集證據
I'll get the evidence.


226
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.390
法蘭西皇朝

227
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.430
天使之城的平安夜
"It's Christmas Eve in the City of Angels


228
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.860
善良的市民都已酣然入睡
and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous


229
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.460
癮君子卻汲汲然找尋著大麻
hopheads prowl for marijuana


230
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.200
全然不知有人要來阻止他們
not knowing that a man is coming to stop them:


231
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.700
那人就是著名的犯罪終結者傑克·文生
Celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.


232
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.840
所有癮君子的剋星
Scourge of grasshoppers and dope fiends everywhere."


233
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.840
喜歡嗎?  傑克老弟
You like it?


234
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.980
喜歡  文筆很好
Yeah, subtle.


235
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.420
怎麼去那麼久?
What took you?


236
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.680
我的夥伴中途跑去幫小姐了
My partner stopped to help a damsel in distress.


237
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.380
他根本搞不清楚輕重緩急
His priorities are all screwed up.


238
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.390
又玩老把戲了  巴德
Up to your old tricks again, Bud?


239
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.860
傑克  好萊塢傑克
Hollywood Jack,


240
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.870
是什麼風把你吹到我們這個窮鄉僻壤來的
what brings you to our humble station house?


241
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.560
你們好嗎?  你來做什麼?
-How are you? -Why are you here?


242
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.690
我在維持市區的治安啊
You know me. Keeping the streets safe.


243
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.300
讓她們穿上衣服  然後收押
Take these two, get them dressed and book them.


244
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.650
大伙都在樓上
-The party's upstairs.


245
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.900
我馬上上去
-Okay, I'll be right up.


246
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.910
這幹什麼?
What's that for?


247
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.420
你是今晚的值勤官  對吧?
You are watch commander tonight, aren't you?


248
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.450
那有怎樣?
Yeah. So?


249
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.520
這是噓噓雜誌的一點心意
A gratuity from Hush-Hush magazine.


250
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.180
拿去買雙新鞋也好
Buy yourself some new loafers.


251
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.620
不用了  謝謝  你自己留著吧
No thanks, Jack. You keep your payoff.


252
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.200
我沒興趣
I'm not interested.


253
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.330
什麼事?
What the hell is this?


254
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.610
他們就是攻擊布朗跟黑倫的那六個墨西哥人
Six spics. Mexicans, sir. The ones who assaulted Brown and Helenowski.


255
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.540
聽說黑倫大量失血而布朗昏迷不醒
I heard Helenowski bled 6 pints and Brown's in a coma.


256
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.240
他們只受了點輕傷回家去了
They have bruises and muscle pulls.


257
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.860
我聽說的可不是這樣
It's not what I heard.


258
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.270
把他們帶進牢房去
Get them into lock up.


259
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.510
喂  史丹斯
Stens,


260
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:21.450
有沒有聽說那六個墨西哥人怎麼整布朗他們的?
you guys hear what those taco benders did to Helenowski and Brown?


261
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.690
黑倫失去了一隻眼睛
Helenowski lost an eye,


262
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.630
而布朗則已經奄奄一息了
and they're reading Brown his last rites.


263
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.400
他們今年的聖誕節過得可真是凄慘呀
That ought to make for a very merry Christmas for them.


264
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.560
喂  各位
Hey, guys.


265
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.800
各位  他們抓到墨西哥人了
Guys. They brought the Mexicans in.


266
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.660
人就在樓下
They're downstairs.


267
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:41.800
史丹斯  過去出口氣
-Let's do it.


268
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.610
對  大夥兒快點去出口氣
-Come on, guys. Let's get them.


269
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.010
喂  史丹斯  派對是在樓土
Stensland, the party's upstairs.


270
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.540
這兒沒你們的事
This doesn't concern you.


271
00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.180
拜託  你們都沒事幹嗎?
Come on, guys. Haven't you got work?


272
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.750
回派對上去
Go back to the party.


273
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.860
這是聖誕節呀  幫幫忙好嗎?
-Come on, it's Christmas, help me out.


274
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.020
走開
-Move it!


275
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.190
我只剩下幾個問題而已
I just got a few more questions.


276
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.770
你們用不著進來的
You don't have to be here.


277
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.930
上
Go!


278
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.630
你最好拉住你的夥伴  免得他殺人
You better put a leash on your partner before he kills somebody.


279
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.640
給他一點教訓
Teach him a lesson!


280
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.870
史丹斯  揍他
Get him, Stens!


281
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.480
這是為我們兄弟出氣的  土蛋
This is for ours, Poncho.


282
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.780
揍他  史丹斯
Get him, Stens!


283
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.040
讓我過去
Let me through!


284
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.020
他又沒做什麼事
No! He didn't do nothing!


285
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.060
你看什麼看
What are you looking at?


286
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.750
叫那個墨西哥人閉嘴
Tell that Mexican to shut up!


287
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.400
你有病啊
You're sick!


288
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.470
你別攪局啊  退後
Don't break it up. Get back! Get back!


289
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.310
去你媽的
Yeah, and fuck your mother!


290
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.500
去你的
Fuck you!


291
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.740
住手!這是命令
Stop, officer! That's an order!


292
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.790
我會把你們全記上去的
You'll all be in my report!


293
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.910
"血腥的聖誕節 "
"Bloody Christmas."


294
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.850
媒體最喜歡亂下標題
The press love to label.


295
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.420
你應該知道此事非同小可
You should know this is bigger than the police board.


296
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.460
大陪審團已經成立了
The grand jury's convening.


297
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.820
搞不好真的會起訴
Indictments may be handed down.


298
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.450
你會出庭作證嗎?
Will you testify?


299
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.030
不會的  長官  我不會
No, sir. I won't.


300
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.700
你要不要跟羅檢察官談一談
District Attorney Loew?


301
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:48.740
你跟史丹斯送酒到了局裏
You and officer Stensland brought the liquor to the station.


302
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.400
史丹斯當時已經醉了
Stensland was already drunk.


303
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.980
你如果自動出面指控他
Appearing as a voluntary witness against him


304
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.980
將可以減輕對你自己的傷害
could offset damage to yourself.


305
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.710
我不會出面指證自己的夥伴
I won't testify against him,


306
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:59.940
或是任何人的
or anyone else.


307
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.550
他真是警界之恥呀
This man is a disgrace.


308
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.350
你的槍跟警徽交出來
Your badge and gun, officer.


309
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.280
你被停職了
You're suspended from duty.


310
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:08.880
解散
Dismissed.


311
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:31.140
我們需要警員擔任證人  來化解對本局的傷害
We need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department.


312
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.770
正義必須伸張
Justice has to be served.


313
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.010
我當然願意作證
Of course I'll testify.


314
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.280
我很高興你有這樣的想法
I'm glad you feel that way, Edmund.


315
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.550
大多數人都不會
Most don't.


316
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.680
他們以為沉默跟正直是同一碼子事
They think silence and integrity are the same thing.


317
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:49.030
他們跟我們建立的警員形象實在差太遠了
Not exactly the image of the new LAPD we're trying to create.


318
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.200
歡迎光臨未來之城洛杉磯
Welcome to Los Angeles, the city of the future.


319
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.670
我可以提出建議嗎  長官?
-May I make a suggestion, sir?


320
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.960
你儘管說
-By all means.


321
00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.010
民眾一定以為我們會大事化小
The public will expect the Department to sweep this under the carpet.


322
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.580
不會
Don't.


323
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.980
拿退休金已萬無一失的人開刀
Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.


324
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.610
強迫他們退休
Force them to retire.


325
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.950
可是還是得重罰一些人
But somebody has to swing.


326
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:15.750
所以要徹底查辦理查德·史丹斯跟巴德·懷特
So indict, try and convict Richard Stensland and Bud White.


327
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.520
而且一定要讓他們坐牢
Secure them jail time.


328
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.720
這樣話就說得很明瞭
The message will be clear.


329
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.420
本局絕對無法忍受
This Department


330
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.530
自以為凌駕在法律之上的警員
will not tolerate officers who think they're above the law.


331
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.970
史丹斯本來就是警界之恥
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment as a policeman.


332
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.200
他的歷任長官都說他貪贓枉法
He's had rotten fitness reports from every C.O. he's served under.


333
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.470
可是巴德·懷特是個難得的人才
But Bud White is a valuable officer.


334
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.240
懷特根本沒長腦子
White's a mindless thug.


335
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.250
不  埃德蒙
No, Edmund


336
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.910
我問你的那些問題  他都可以回答"願意"
but he can answer "yes" to those questions I've asked you before.


337
00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.520
警局跟民眾都需要模範警察
The Department and the public need role models.


338
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.280
儀表出眾為人正直  可以讓民眾崇拜的人
Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire.


339
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.830
巡佐  我晉陞你為隊長
Sergeant I'll promote you to lieutenant


340
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.370
立即生效
effective immediately.


341
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.990
刑事隊長
Detective Lieutenant.


342
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.870
艾德  你才三十歲
Ed, you're 30.


343
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.570
你父親三十三才升隊長的
Your father didn't make lieutenant till he was 33.


344
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.080
我知道  長官
I know that, sir.


345
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.770
而他升隊長時正是升為刑事隊長
When he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.


346
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.350
在我們開慶功宴前
Before we start polishing our laurels


347
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.440
最好先找個預備證人
it'd look better if we had a corroborative witness.


348
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.490
這可不太好找了
That won't be easy to come by.


349
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.110
大伙最恨這種打小報告的人
The men hate a stool pigeon.


350
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.090
傑克·文生
Jack Vincennes.


351
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.090
他出手打了其中一個
He hit one of the Mexicans.


352
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.130
像文生這種老賊叫他承認自己的過失還有可能
A veteran like Vincennes might be willing to admit his own culpability


353
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.330
要他出賣同僚根本不可能
but he'd never rat out a fellow officer.


354
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.410
傑克是警網群英的技術顧問
Jack's the technical advisor on Badge of Honor.


355
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.060
他靠那個吃飯的
He lives for it.


356
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.870
我們就從這方面著手
That's how to get to him.


357
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.310
我希望你能在一旁觀察
I'd like you to observe, Ed.


358
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.450
叫文生警官進來
Call Sergeant Vincennes.


359
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.350
很聰明的孩子
Bright kid.


360
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.480
你或許可以蒙受其利
You may reap the benefit


361
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.820
可是你受得了局裏同仁鄙視的眼神嗎?
but are you ready to be despised in the Department?


362
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.390
是的  長官  我受得了
Yes, sir, I am.


363
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.860
那就這樣吧
So be it.


364
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.360
隊長  我們就開門見山
Sergeant, we'll get right to it.


365
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.540
有九位市民指證你毆打加西亞
Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.


366
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.870
不過我們有位證人願意指認所有涉案的人
But we have a witness who will name names


367
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.920
並且證明你是在被打了以後才出手還擊的
and testify that you hit back


368
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.010
還有呢?
only after being hit.


369
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.700
而你將指證  只有三名已拿到退休金的人涉案
You will testify against 3 officers


370
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.490
其它人則屬無辜
who have earned their pensions and plead ignorance about the rest.


371
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.590
不必  謝了  我不是那種打小報告的人
No thanks. I'm not a snitch.


372
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.130
我保證只對你從輕處以停職的處份
I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist, a brief suspension


373
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.070
然後把你暫時由緝毒組調到風化組去
followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Vice.


374
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.800
等你由風化組調回來  一樣可以回去做節目
You transfer out of Vice, you'll be back on the show.


375
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.310
節目?
The show?


376
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.680
警網群英啊  文生
Badge of Honor, Vincennes.


377
00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.380
我們得暫時減少你的曝光率
We need to tone down your profile for a bit.


378
00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.980
我看你一直都很聰明的
I doubt you've ever taken a stupid breath.


379
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.650
可別突然變笨了
Don't start now.


380
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.230
好  我作證就是了
Okay, I'll do it.


381
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.890
大陪審團明天會聽取你的證詞  你可以離開了
The grand jury will hear your testimony tomorrow.


382
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.450
那就這樣好了  警官
And so it goes Detective Lieutenant.


383
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.420
明天在大陪審團前好好表現一下
Ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son.


384
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.390
穿套帥一點的西裝好好秀一下
Wear a smart-looking suit and ace them.


385
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.590
還有艾德  把眼鏡拿掉
And Ed lose the glasses.


386
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.770
原來你就是那一個證人
So you're the stellar witness.


387
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.370
我應該猜到的
I should have known.


388
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.770
局長給了你什麼?
What's the Chief throwing you?


389
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.140
給了我什麼?
Throwing me?


390
00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.180
對呀!給了你什麼好處
Yeah, Exley, what's the payoff?


391
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.440
你是給好處的專家
You're the payoff expert.


392
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.550
而我只是盡我的職責而已
I'm just doing my duty.


393
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.420
好了  你只不過是  抓到一個大好良機而已  大學生
Come on, you're playing an angle here, college boy.


394
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.490
你一定是得了什麼好處
You'll get something so you don't have to hobnob with the cops


395
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.920
所以以後用不著跟那些  恨你入骨的同仁打交道了
who'll hate you for snitching.


396
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.960
如果他們升你的話  你得小心點了
If they're making you detective, watch out.


397
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.230
局裏有些人這一次會死的很慘
Some Bureau guys will burn in this


398
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.430
而你將會跟他們的朋友一起工作
and you'll be working with their friends.


399
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.040
那你自己呢?
What about you?


400
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.430
我只不過糾出三個老掉牙的傢伙
I'm snitching 3 old-timers


401
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.530
他們下個禮拜就會在奧勒岡釣魚了
who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.


402
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.770
跟你比起來我可是清清白白
Next to you, I'm clean


403
00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.310
真聰明

Bud White will fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.


407
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.490
組長  到底什麼事?

我很欣賞你拒絕出庭作證

412
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.010
還有對朋友的忠心
and your loyalty to your partner.


413
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.170
我很欣賞你這種警察
I admire you as a policeman


414
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.240
而你渾身是勁的蠻勁  更是幹這種工作所必須的
and your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job.


415
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.290
你整那些打老婆的人的方法令我刮目相看
I'm impressed with your punishment of women-beaters.


416
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.910
你恨他們嗎?  溫德爾
Do you hate them, Wendell?


417
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.490
你到底有什麼事?
What do you want?


418
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.960
這是你的
They're yours.


419

拿去吧
Take them.


420
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.600
不起訴我了?
There's no bill on me?


421
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.730
有四個證人翻供了
-4 witnesses recanted their testimony.


422
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.970
為什麼呢?  他們回心轉意了
-Why? They had a change of heart.


423
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.130
史丹斯呢?
Stensland?


424
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.040
他完了
Your partner's through.


425
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.410
局長命令下的代罪羔羊
Scapegoat on the Chief's orders.


426

艾斯利?  艾斯利得到他所要的
-Exley! -Exley got what he wanted.


428
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.820
他玩弄權謀的技術比我還高明
As a politician he exceeds even myself.


429
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.330
我們局裏需要艾斯利這樣的聰明人
The Department needs smart men like Exley


430
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.060
也需要像你這樣的硬漢
and direct men like you.


431
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.370
我需要你幫我完成  局長交付給我的一項任務
Look, I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me.


432
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.970
這項任務能勝任的人沒幾個
A duty few men are fit for


433
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.130
而你卻是天生的好手
but you were born for.


434
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.040
你將會在位於市政府的兇殺組工作
You'd be working out of Homicide at City Hall.


435
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.240
兇殺組?
Homicide?


436
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.780
偵辦兇殺命案嗎?
Working cases?


437
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.150
你的才能並不在此  溫德爾
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.


438
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.920
我要你做的工作是要靠力氣的
It's a muscle job.


439
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.050
你聽我的命令行事  不要問東問西的
You'll do as I say and ask no questions.


440
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.350
明白我的意思了嗎?
Do you follow my drift?


441
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.000
一清二楚  長官
In Technicolor, sir.


442

誰知道他們能紅到什麼地步呢
who knows how far they'll go.


446
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.350
反正前途無量就是了

好了

"米奇·柯漢的手下陳屍日落大道 "

449
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.760
這位是杜斯·培金斯
"Meet Deuce Perkins,


450
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.390
米奇·柯漢手下的頭號毒王
Mickey Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.


451
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.700
他會不會是幕後的主使人?
Could he be behind the hits?


452
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.940
是不是他在整合黑社會組織?
Is he consolidating organized crime power?


453
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.550
大概不是
I suppose not.


454
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.460
不過有件事是錯不了的
One thing's for sure:


455
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:34.030
有人在按部就班地幹掉米奇的手下

456
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.870
"柯漢手下的毒王家中遇害"

457
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.280
而在另一方面呢 據說洛城的警方
Meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD


458
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.180
已經擺出陣仗要大舉掃除

459
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.680
想接替米奇·柯漢的黑社會份子
from filling the void left by Mickey's absence.


460
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.450
我一旦有進一步消息
When I know more,


461

With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime-free.


464
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.300
局長希望能保持這個樣子
The Chief wants to keep it that way.


465

你在克裏夫蘭也是在道上混的
In Cleveland, you're an organized crime associate


466
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.970
只可惜不太懂我們白道的規矩
in desperate need of re-education in the ways of polite society.


467
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.510
我聽到了一些傳言
I hear things.


468
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.740
譬如那些個暗殺小組

469
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.720
他們在屠殺柯漢的手下

You should've thought of that before Bloody Christmas.

就想到這一點  破個大案子
Make a major case.

537
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.920
威廉警官請接無線電
Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.


538
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.760
威廉警官
Sergeant Williams?


539
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.890
兇殺組有沒有人在?
Is there anybody up there in Homicide?


540
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.500
到底有沒有人在?
Anybody there?


541
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.070
我是艾斯利警官
Lieutenant Exley.


542
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.770
市中心發生兇殺案了
You've got a homicide downtown.


543
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.380
在夜貓子咖啡廳
-The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.


544
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.510
我知道了
-I got it.


545
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.760
長官  至少死了一個人
At least one person's dead.


546
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.400
我路過想進去喝一杯咖啡
I stopped for coffee.


547
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.970
不許任何人從這個門出來
No one comes through the front door. Understand?


548
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.040
- 明白嗎?  - 明白
- Understand? - Yes，sir


549
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.020
在街道兩頭設立路障  絕對
I want barricades at both ends of the street. Make sure--


550
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.190
電話是我接的  案子是我的
I took the call. It's my case.


551
00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.360
你不會想接這個案子的
You don't want it


552
00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.630
案子也不會是你的
and you can't have it.


553
00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.800
電話是我接的
I took the call.


554
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.040
案子是我的
It's mine.


555
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.740
我派你當副手好了
I'll make you my second-in-command.


556
00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.510
組長  請到這邊來一下  到那邊去
Captain, over here, please.


557
00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.480
任何人都不許進出
No body allowed inside.


558
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.720
廚子曾開過槍
The cook drew a gun and set it off.


559
00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.410
其它人死在男廁所
The rest died in the men's room.


560
00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:24.530
長官  我們找到了十五發散彈鎗彈殼
Sir we got a total of 15 spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.


561
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.260
我猜兇手有三人  手持一次裝填五發的散彈鎗
I'm betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity pumps,


562
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.560
子彈射完剛好十五發
all of them emptying once.


563
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.640
對不起  長官  我們認出一名死者的身份了
Excuse me, we got an I.D. on one of the victims.


564
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.140
是狄克·史丹斯蘭
It's Dick Stensland.


565
00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.240
我一開始以為她是麗泰·海華
At first, I thought she was Rita Hayworth.


566
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.780
對  我也是
Yeah, me too.


567
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.480
真是逃過牢獄之災的好方法
Hell of a way to avoid prison.


568
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.140
發生什麼事了?
What happened?


569
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.730
好像是有三個人搶劫咖啡廳
Appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.


570
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.000
收銀員拿出了手槍所以兇手把他給殺了
The guy at the register pulled a.38, so they killed him.


571
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.380
然後再把店裏的人殺個精光
Then they killed everyone else.


572
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.820
長官  夜貓子那件命案可以認屍了
Lieutenant, we're ready with that Nite Owl I.D.


573
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.990
她是你女兒嗎?
Is this your daughter?


574
00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.460
我不知道
I don't know.


575
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.720
我們知道這很不容易
We know this is difficult.


576
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.460
你慢慢來
Take your time.


577
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.160
她好像是我的蘇珊
It seems like my Susan.


578
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.500
可是我的蘇珊是金髮不是紅髮
But my Susan was a blonde, not a redhead.


579
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.730
你上次見到她是什麼時候?
When was the last time you saw her?


580
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.310
就是聖誕節之前
Just before Christmas.


581
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:46.640
我們吵了一架  我不喜歡她的男友
We'd fought. I didn't like her boyfriend.


582
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:48.970
雷佛太太
Mrs. Lefferts


583
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.880
你女兒有沒有任何特別的記號
does your daughter have any distinguishing marks?


584
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.720
你弄錯了  先生  我很好
You got the wrong idea, mister. I'm fine.


585
00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:00.320
她大腿旁邊有個胎記
She has a birthmark on her hip.


586
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.200
是她沒錯  我的寶貝
It's her. My baby!


587
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.980
節哀順變  雷佛太太
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.


588
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.050
誰負責偵辦的?
Who's in charge of this investigation?


589
00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.340
史密斯組長以及我本人  怎麼了?
Captain Smith and myself. Why?


590
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:24.880
"夜貓子大屠殺 "
"The Nite Owl Massacre."


591
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:26.850
儘管口氣誇張了點
Hyperbole aside


592
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.320
這樣的大案子卻非得迅速破案才行
this is a heinous crime that requires swift resolution.


593
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:32.720
死了六個人
Six victims.


594
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.350
其中一個還是我們自己人  狄克·史丹斯蘭
One of them, one of our own. Dick Stensland.


595
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.020
他是夜貓子的常客
He was a Nite Owl regular,


596
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.360
挑錯了時間  走錯了地方
in the wrong place at the wrong time.


597
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.440
動機似乎是搶劫
Robbery is the likely motive.


598
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:47.170
由櫃檯上的手套印  以及初步的監識結果看來
We have rubber glove smears on the register and forensics


599
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.870
兇手的確是三個人沒錯
tend toward a trio of shooters.


600
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.380
而且我們已經有了重要線索了
We do have one hot lead.


601
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.010
有人看見三個黑人青少年
Three Negro juveniles


602
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.350
在葛瑞菲斯公園拿著散彈鎗亂射
were seen discharging shotguns in Griffith Park.


603
00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.650
有位公園管理員認出他們  開著一部48至50年
A park ranger I.D.'d them as driving a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe


604
00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:03.520
的福特褐紅色雙門跑車
maroon in color.


605
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.220
一小時前警員問到一位賣報的
An hour ago a canvassing crew found a news vendor


606
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.560
他說在深夜一點的時候
who saw a maroon Merc coupe parked


607
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.560
看見褐紅色水星雙門跑車停在夜貓子門口
by the Nite Owl at 1 a.m.


608
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:16.370
監理處已經整理出  水星雙門車的車主記錄了
DMV has come up with a registration list of Merc coupes.


609
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:21.880
二人一組每組查訪三位車主

610
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.470
局內的偵訊工作由艾斯利負責
Interrogations will be led by Lt. Edmund Exley.


611
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:29.470
別吵了
Enough on that!


612
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.050
各位  去把兇手給我抓回來
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.


613
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.150
動用所有必要的警力
Use all necessary force.


614
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.020
這是洛杉磯市民的命令
The people of Los Angeles demand it.


615
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.320
解散
Dismissed.


616
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.560
直接懸賞他們的人頭不更乾脆
Why not just put a bounty on them?


617
00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.670
可以走了嗎  懷特?
-Ready to roll?


618
00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.400
你自己去就好了  我另外有事
-You take them, I got something to do.


619
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.100
萬一正好就是那三個
What if one of these names--?


620
00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:01.370
找別人跟你去
Get somebody else.


621
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.420
名單拿到了
I got our assignments, Big V.


622
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.820
照這份名單找下去一輩子也找不到
We go by this list, we got zero chance of making this collar.


623
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.950
我有位線人對傑佛遜街以南很熟
I got a guy who knows what happens south of Jefferson.


624
00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.420
他可以幫我們抓到人
He'll put us at 50-50.


625
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.790
傑克  你幹什麼?
What are you doing?


626
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.020
你上一次就是這樣子才惹上一身麻煩的
It's the same sort of thing that got you in trouble before.


627
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.400
我就跟你冒這個險
I'll take those odds.


628
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.830
現在開始由我們來
We got it from here.


629
00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.540
你們應該隨身帶著攝影記者的
You two should bring along a photographer.


630
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.750
我想查一下你一位顧客的地址
I need an address on a customer of yours.


631
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:37.040
她的名字叫琳恩
Her name is Lynn.


632
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.480
你就丟給我這麼個名字?
-That's all I got to go on?


633
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.520
對
-Yeah.


634
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.590
你很清楚我是什麼人  所以上道一點吧!
You already know who I mean, so cough it up.


635
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.220
上頭有收帳跟送貨的地址
There's a billing address and a delivery address.


636
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.890
你是皮爾斯·巴卻嗎?
Are you Pierce Patchett?


637
00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.450
是
I am.


638
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.720
你是來勸募警察福利基金的嗎?
Are you soliciting for police charities?


639
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.890
上一次是你打電話來的吧?
Last time you called my office.


640
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.760
到下面的車庫  我們到那兒談
Go on down to the driveway. We'll talk there.


641
00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.080
你有什麼事?
What can I do for you?


642
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.050
你昨晚在哪裏?
-Where were you last night?


643
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.120
在這裏舉行晚宴
-I was here hosting a party.


644
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.550
把狄克·史丹斯蘭的事告訴我
Tell me about Dick Stensland.


645
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.180
我不認識他  你是
I don't know him, Mr.--?


646
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.660
懷特警員
Officer White.


647
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.350
你認識蘇珊雷佛嗎?
You know Sue Lefferts?


648
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.490
你知道我認識的  你看見我跟她在一起的
You know I do. You saw me with her.


649
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.490
你怎麼找到我的?
How did you find me?


650
00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:00.970
尼克的烈酒商店
Nick's Liquor.


651
00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:04.230
是琳恩·佈雷肯寫的收帳地址
This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.


652
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.500
對哦!
Of course.


653
00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.210
蘇珊雷佛在夜貓子死了
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.


654
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.810
我正在調查這件案子
I'm investigating.


655
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.080
沒什麼事吧?  巴卻先生
Everything all right?


656
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.910
沒事  謝謝你
Fine, Phillip, thank you.


657
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.060
你另外那個保鏢巴茲呢?
What happened to the other guy, Buzz?


658
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.290
巴茲·米克斯已經不替我工作了
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.


659
00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.520
雷佛在聖誕夜似乎被打了
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve


660
00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.100
可是她卻沒報案  為什麼?
but didn't act it. Why?


661
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.460
我想她是被網球拍打到的
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.


662
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:37.240
她很喜歡打雙打
She was a big doubles fan.


663
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.600
你是命案死者的友人
You're a known associate of a woman killed in a mass murder.


664
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.210
要不要到局裏去跟我們談?
-Want to go downtown to discuss this?


665
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.770
只是為了這件事嗎  警察先生
-Is this official?


666
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.040
我怎麼覺得你似乎是為了個人的私事來找我的
Somehow I have the feeling this is more personal with you.


667
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.850
好了
All right, then


668
00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:01.160
你現在是奉命調查跟命案有關的事情嗎?
are you concerned about criminal matters peripheral to the murders?


669
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.270
目前沒有  那你不見得要向上級報告羅?
-Not at the moment. -You're not obligated to report them?


670
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.940
為什麼雷佛臉上會有淤血?
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?


671
00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.910
我需要一位麗泰·海華來充實我影棚的陣容
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.


672
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.170
什麼影棚?
What little studio?


673
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.180
我們那兒有很多像電影明星的女孩
Well, there's Gardner, Russell, Monroe, Turner.


674
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.870
琳恩是我的薇洛尼卡.雷克
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.


675
00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.510
我專找長的像電影明星的女孩
I use girls that look like movie stars.


676
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.710
有時難免得稍微整容一下
Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.


677
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.950
那晚正好被你看見了
When the work was done, that's when you saw us.


678
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.920
所以她老母認不出她來
It's why her mom couldn't I.D. her.


679
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.990
我的老天啊!
Jesus fucking Christ!


680
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.530
我不是老天  我是皮爾斯·巴卻
No, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.


681
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.900
我知道你職責在身
I sense you're on your best behavior,


682
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.200
可是我言盡於此
but that's all I'm saying.


683
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.400
如果你再追問下去我只好找律師來了
If you persist, we'll meet with my attorney.


684
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.510
你要不要琳恩的地址?我想她似乎不
Would you like Lynn Bracken's address?


685
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.770
我已經有她的地址了
I got her address.


686
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.270
找出殺死蘇珊的人  懷特先生
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.


687
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.410
我會給你一大筆獎金的
I'll give you a handsome reward.


688
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.220
任君選擇
Whatever you desire!


689
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.500
我知道你還沒睡
I know you're not asleep.


690
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.900
你是在跟我說話嗎?
What do you want?


691
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.300
你要什麼?  我的五塊錢
My 5 bucks.


692
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.000
我就這麼些錢了
It was the only one I had.


693
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.630
現在?
Right now?


694
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.510
喂  寶貝  叫他別來騷擾我們
Hey, doll face, tell him to leave us alone.


695
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:28.080
我瞭解
I understand.


696
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.210
好的
Okay, fine.


697
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:32.650
哦!寶貝
Oh, baby


698
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.310
壞消息
bad news.


699
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.510
你得走了
You have to go.


700
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.090
走?
Go?


701
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.720
有很重要的事發生了  所以你得走了  不過
Something very important has come up and you have to go.


702
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.760
我改天會補償你的  好嗎?
I'll make it up to you.


703
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.330
我會的  我保證
I will, I promise.


704
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:45.590
讓我過去
Excuse me.


705
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.330
是警察嗎?
Is it the cops?


706
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.340
佈雷肯小姐
Miss Bracken


707
00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.640
我是懷特警員
I'm Officer White.


708
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.900
我知道你要來
I've been expecting you,


709
00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.450
只是沒想到這麼快
just not this soon.


710
00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.110
皮爾斯來過電話  把蘇珊的遭遇告訴我了
Pierce called. He told me what happened to Sue.


711
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.340
沒什麼麻煩吧  寶貝?
Everything all right, doll?


712
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:05.920
要不要我把他攆走?
Want me to get rid of him?


713
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.420
上路吧  兄弟
Hit the road.


714
00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.090
說不定我會走
Maybe I will


715
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.060
也說不定我不走
maybe I won't.


716
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.960
我是洛城警察  快點滾開
LAPD. Get out of here


717
00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.030
否則我叫你太太來抓你了
or I'll have your wife come get you.


718
00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.080
警員  議員
-Officer. -Councilman.


719
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.700
要不要來杯酒?
-Would you care for a drink?


720
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.240
好  純威士忌
-Yeah, Scotch straight.


721
00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.470
我跟蘇珊還挺不錯的
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,


722
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.540
不過我們不是朋友
but we weren't friends.


723
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.340
你明白我的意思嗎?
Know what I mean?


724
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.810
她死了你會難過嗎?
You sorry she's dead?


725
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.780
當然會
Of course I am.


726
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.550
這算哪門子問題?
What kind of question is that?


727
00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.290
你知道皮爾斯為什麼這樣子耍你嗎?
Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?


728
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.950
你用耍這個字會把我惹毛的
Use words like that, you might make me mad.


729
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.260
不過你知不知道為什麼?
But, do you know?


730
00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.460
我知道
Yeah, I know.


731
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.260
他讓女孩整容變得像電影明星
Patchett's running whores


732
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.900
然後替他賣淫
cut to look like movie stars.


733
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.170
而從他的豪宅看來
And, judging by his address,


734
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.570
他另外還有更大的買賣
something bigger on the side.


735
00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.610
所以不希望太過出風頭
He doesn't want any attention.


736
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.440
沒錯  我們的動機很自私
That's right. Our motives are selfish


737
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.510
不過我們會合作的
so we're cooperating.


738
00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.680
那就合作吧  佈雷肯小姐!  蘇珊為什麼去夜貓子?
So cooperate. Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?


739
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.450
我不知道!  這是我第一次聽到夜貓子這個名字
I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.


740
00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:48.780
她是怎麼認識皮爾斯的?
How'd she meet Patchett?


741
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.480
皮爾斯交遊很廣
Pierce meets people.


742
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:52.560
蘇珊則滿懷明星夢
Sue had dreams of Hollywood


743
00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.090
如今卻落得這個下場
and this is how they turned out.


744
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.160
全拜皮爾斯之賜
Thanks to Pierce,


745
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.430
我們依然得繼續裝下去
we still get to act a little.


746
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.060
告訴我皮爾斯的底細吧
Tell me about Pierce.


747
00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.370
他還在等你向他開價呢?
He's waiting for you to mention money.


748
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.170
要不要聽聽我的建議?佈雷肯小姐
Want advice, Miss Bracken?


749
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.870
叫我琳恩
It's Lynn.


750
00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.000
佈雷肯小姐
Miss Bracken


751
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.740
千萬不要想要賄賂我
don't ever try to fucking bribe me


752
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.320
否則我他媽的整得你跟皮爾斯叫苦連天
or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.


753
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:19.940
聖誕夜那天的事深印在我腦中
I remember you from Christmas Eve.


754
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.080
你一向很喜歡幫女人對不對?
You have a thing for helping women, don't you?


755
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.060
說不定我只是他媽的好奇而已
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.


756
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.990
你一天到晚把髒話掛在嘴上
-You say "fuck" a lot.


757
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.560
你卻一天到晚為了錢在操人
-You fuck for money.


758
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:31.960
你的襯衫上有血
There's blood on your shirt.


759
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.530
是不是幹員警就得打人?
An integral part of your job?


760
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.540
對  你喜歡打人嗎?
-Yeah. -Do you enjoy it?


761
00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.570
如果對方欠揍的話
When they deserve it.


762
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.370
他們今天欠揍嗎?
Did they deserve it today?


763
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.030
我不知道
I'm not sure.


764
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.110
可是你還是揍人了
-But you did it anyway.


765
00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.300
對
-Yeah.


766
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.810
就像你今天接了十幾個人一樣
Like the half dozen guys you screwed today.


767
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.820
事實上只有兩個
Actually, it was only two.


768
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.150
你真是與眾不同  懷特警官
You're different, Officer White.


769
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:55.760
五年來你是第一個
You're the first man in years


770
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:59.260
沒說我很像薇洛妮卡的人
who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake.


771
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.450
你比她漂亮
You look better than Veronica Lake.


772
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.000
皮爾斯他?
Pierce Patchett?


773
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.460
他會把我們賺的抽一部份
He takes a cut of our earnings


774
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:12.230
去替我們投資理財
and invests it for us.


775
00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:15.670
他不許我們吸毒  也不會打我們
He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.


776
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.800
你們警察能想像得到這種矛盾的做法嗎?
Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?


777
00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.110
他讓你去整得像薇洛妮卡的?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake.


778
00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.690
不
No.


779
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:29.250
我本來是黑髮  其它的都沒變
I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.


780
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.920
你只要知道這些就夠了
And that's all the news that's fit to print.


781
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.060
很高興認識你
It's nice meeting you.


782
00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.170
我想再跟你見面
-I'd like to see you again.


783
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.530
你這是在約我嗎?
-For a date


784
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.000
還是在跟我預約時間?
or an appointment?


785
00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.600
我不知道
I don't know.


786
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.510
如果是約會  那你該告訴我你的名字
-For a date, I'd know your first name.


787
00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.770
忘了我剛剛說的話
-Forget I asked.


788
00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.580
是我說錯話了
It was a mistake.


789
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.990
雷歐那比威爾嗎?
Leonard Bidwell?


790
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.130
下來聊聊吧
Come down here and talk to us.


791
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.270
最近左拳練得怎麼樣?
How's the left these days?


792
00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:24.340
這關你什麼事?
What's it to you?


793
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.500
我看過你跟佳威蘭小子打拳
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.


794
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.240
我很喜歡你的拳風
I like your style.


795
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:33.320
你有什麼事?警察先生
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?


796
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.480
你有個兄弟關在佛森監獄
You got a brother in Folsom.


797
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.060
我知道  是我把他關進去的
I put him there.


798
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.280
他得關到1970年
Until 1970.


799
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.660
你希不希望只關到1960年
How'd you like to make it 1960?


800
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:44.590
我認識那位法官副組長是檢察官的好朋友
I know the judge, and Lieutenant Exley is good friends with the D.A.


801
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:50.600
好了  我們在找三個愛玩散彈鎗的黑人
We're looking for 3 colored guys who like to shoot shotguns.


802
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.140
其中一個開著褐紅色的跑車
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.


803
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:54.610
你想害我背上罪人的名字
-Want me to snitch?


804
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.270
你想不想幫你哥哥減個十年
-Want to buy your brother 10 years?


805
00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:57.380
是十年對不對?
-It was 10 years, right?


806
00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.570
對  十年
-Yeah, 10 years.


807
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:59.870
你用不著開口
You don't have to say anything,


808
00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.780
只要看看名單  用手指就行了
just look at this list and point.


809
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.280
那傢伙很壞所以我直接告訴你
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.


810
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.890
蜜糖雷伊柯林斯
Sugar Ray Collins.


811
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.580
開著一部49年的福特跑車
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.


812
00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.130
車子很漂亮
Beautiful ride.


813
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.150
有沒有散彈鎗我不知道
Don't know about shotguns,


814
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.460
不過他一向以殺狗為樂
but he gets his thrills killing dogs.


815
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.260
他是標準的垃圾
He's righteous trash.


816
00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.100
你看看  離這兒才五分鐘
Look at that. It's five minutes from here.


817
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.260
謝謝你
Thanks.


818
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.240
你會給我消息吧?
I'll hear from you


819
00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.740
我哥哥的事
about my brother?


820
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.970
手抬高一點  雷尼  抬高一點
Keep it up, Lenny. U p!


821
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.690
到了  在後面
There it is. It's in the back.


822
00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:00.300
自己人的車  該死
-One of ours. -Shit,


823
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:01.600
有人想趕在我們的前面
somebody beat us here!


824
00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.780
該死  我的眼鏡
Damn it! My glasses!


825
00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:11.940
你開什麼玩笑
You're kidding!


826
00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.180
反正別朝我開槍就是了
Well, just don't shoot me.


827
00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:25.890
你們來做什麼?
What are you doing here?


828
00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.270
我們正好在這附近
We were in the neighborhood.


829
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.060
查到什麼了? 三把十二發的散彈鎗
-What do you got? -Three 12-gauge pumps.


830
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:33.900
空的子彈盒  還有一些現金
And cash.


831
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.210
再見了  掃黃組
So long, Vice. Badge of Honor,


832
00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.780
警網群英  我來了

833
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.850
去你的  這機會是我們的
Fuck you! This is our collar.


834
00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.140
安靜!
Quiet!


835
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.750
這兒我官階最高
I'm ranking officer here.


836
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.380
我們合作抓人  不用再爭了
We go as a team. End of story.


837
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:52.380
好
Right.


838
00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:54.820
有幾個人口?
How many ways in?


839
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.830
只有一個  從樓梯上去
Only one. Up the stairs.


840
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.320
他是很認真的
He's very serious.


841
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.410
我們是警察!  搞什麼? 不要開槍
Police! Don't shoot!


842
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.690
別動
-Don't move.


843
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.520
殺了他  傑克  閉嘴  布魯尼
-Ace him, Jack! Shut up.


844
00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.710
很緊張吧?
Anxious, aren't you?


845
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:23.980
不要殺他們
Don't kill them.


846
00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:29.260
退回去  退回去
Back, back, back!


847
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.330
你放開我
Get off me!


848
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.760
面對著牆站好
Against the wall!


849
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:32.920
面對著牆站好
Against the wall!


850
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:33.830
把雙手舉起來
-Put your hands up!


851
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.400
過來  孩子  快點
-Get over there.


852
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.230
閉嘴  把手放在背後
Shut up! Hands behind your back!


853
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:43.900
怎樣?  走出辦公室的感覺如何
So how's it feel getting out of the office?


854
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.610
這是監識組來的報告
This came from forensics.


855
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.450
他們在燒衣服
"Burning clothes.


856
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.620
卡西達少年監獄
Casitas Youth Camp."


857
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.220
這兒挺擠的  懷特
It's crowded in here, White.


858
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.230
他們殺死了史丹斯蘭
These guys killed Stensland.


859
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:21.970
這些彈殼上面的彈道痕跡
The ejection marks on the shells fired from the shotguns


860
00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:27.180
跟我們在夜貓子找到的彈殼是一樣的
are identical to those on the shell casings found at the Nite Owl.


861
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.450
我要他們坦白招供  埃德蒙
I want confessions, Edmund.


862
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:32.750
熬了一晚他們應該已經軟化了
A night's stewing has softened them up.


863
00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:34.330
我會瓦解他們心理防線的
I'll break them, sir.


864
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.280
你確定我們金童干的來嗎?
Are you sure golden boy is up to the task, Cap?


865
00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.120
我想你會被他的能耐嚇一跳的
I think you'd be surprised what the lad is capable of.


866
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.590
你今年22歲對不對?
You're 22. Aren't you, Ray?


867
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.360
有沒有警察修理過你?
Did an officer work you over?


868
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.460
你今年22歲對不對?
-You're 22, right?


869
00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.230
你為什麼一直這樣子問我?
-Why do you keep asking that?


870
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.070
因為滿22歲就可以判死刑

871
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:23.680
所以你應該十年前殺人才對的
You should've pulled this caper years ago.


872
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.900
判個終生監禁  在少年感化院關到21歲
Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt


873
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.410
再轉到佛森監獄去
transfer to Folsom a big man


874
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:31.210
找個愛人同志
get yourself a sissy.


875
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:33.580
我不搞同性戀那一套的
I don't truck with no sissies.


876
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.360
路易斯
Louis.


877
00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.480
幹嘛?
What?


878
00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.350
你跟路易斯兩個人  在卡西達一起坐過牢對不對?
You did the Casitas Youth Camp with Louis.


879
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.360
你為什麼一直問我路易斯的事情?
Why you keep asking me about Louis?


880
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:47.400
他的事跟我無關
His business is his business.


881
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.490
蜜糖  路易斯跟我說你在卡西達搞過同性戀
Sugar, Louis told me you went sissy up at Casitas.


882
00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.400
你熬不下去了
You couldn't do the time,


883
00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.340
所以找了個白人男孩來照顧你
so you got a big white boy to look after you.


884
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.710
他們還說他們會管你叫蜜糖
Said they called you "Sugar"


885
00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.540
是因為你對愛人同志很甜
because you gave it out so sweet.


886
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.670
路易斯他才獻出了玻璃呢
Louis gave it up at Casitas.


887
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.580
我在我們牢房是老大
I was the boss jock in my dorm!


888
00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.650
路易斯才是愛人同志
Louis was the sissy!


889
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:08.380
路易斯為棒棒糖就獻身了
Louis gave it up for candy bars!


890
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.960
他簡直比狗還笨
He isn't got the sense of a dog!


891
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.660
聽說你很喜歡殺狗
You like to shoot dogs.


892
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:16.160
狗沒有資格活
Dogs got no reason to live.


893
00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:19.760
你對人也有同樣的感覺嘛?
Feel the same way about people?


894
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:21.660
你到底想說什麼嘛?
What're you trying to say?


895
00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.360
我們搜到散彈鎗了
We got the shotguns.


896
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.970
我根本沒有什麼散彈鎗的
I don't own no shotguns.


897
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:27.700
你們為什麼把衣服拿去燒呢?
Why were you throwing clothes in the incinerator?


898
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.170
你說什麼?
Say what?


899
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.910
有鄰居說看見你們把衣服拿去焚化爐燒
A neighbor said she saw you throwing clothes in the incinerator.


900
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.410
這樣子可不太妙
Doesn't look good.


901
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.640
沒見到法官之前我不會再說話了
I isn't talking till I see a judge.


902
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:38.580
你是不是吸了毒了?
Were you on hop?


903
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.620
我們逮捕你的時候你已經攤在那兒
You were passed out when we arrested you.


904
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.310
泰依跟路易斯才會吸那玩意兒
Ty and Louis fuck with that shit, not me.


905
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.050
我不會  他們在哪兒弄到貨的?
Where do they get their stuff?


906
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:50.150
快點  給我個人向檢察官交待
Man. Give me one to feed the D.A.


907
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.020
這樣子我臉上好看一點
It'll make me look good


908
00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:56.160
那我相信你不是同性戀
and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk like his sissy partners.


909
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:02.430
好了  雷蒙
All right.


910
00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.310
多說一點路易斯和泰依的事
Tell me one more thing about Jones and Fontaine.


911
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:06.940
他們在哪兒弄到毒品的?
Where do they get drugs?


912
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.580
羅蘭那法瑞那兒
Roland Navarette.


913
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.480
他在木屋山莊那兒有個據點
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.


914
00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:17.420
而且還賣紅魔鬼
And he sells red devils.


915
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.120
艾斯利很行  我服了他了
Exley's good, I'll give him that.


916
00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.450
我要去休息一下了
I'll take a break.


917
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.700
對了  雷依
You know, Ray,


918
00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:29.330
我都說你可能被送進毒氣室了
I'm talking about the gas chamber


919
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.400
可是你卻一直沒有問我  我們到底在查什麼案子
and you haven't asked me what this is about.


920
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:34.970
你是跳到黃河都洗不清了
You got a big "guilty" sign around your neck.


921
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:42.000
真是技術高超  埃德蒙
That was masterful, Edmund.


922
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:43.450
他已經準備好要招供了
He's ready to go.


923
00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.260
拿份報紙給路易斯
Give Jones the newspaper.


924
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.760
我要他跳起來
I want him primed.


925
00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.420
把手銬拿掉好讓他看報
Take the cuffs off, so he can read it.


926
00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.220
雷依剛剛出賣你了
Ray Collins just ratted you off.


927
00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:00.460
他說夜貓子那件事是你帶頭的
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.


928
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.500
我覺得是雷依帶頭的
I think it was Ray's idea.


929
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.540
你要是招出來我想我可以救你一命
You talk, I think I can save your life.


930
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.110
死了六個人啊

931
00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.370
總得有人頂罪吧!
and someone has to pay for it.


932
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:11.530
那個人可以是你  也可以是雷依
Now, it can be you, or it can be Ray.


933
00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.820
路易斯  他說你是同性戀的
Louis, he called you queer.


934
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.780
還說你在卡西達被玩的很厲害
-At Casitas, you took it up the ass.


935
00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.410
我根本沒有殺人
-I didn't kill nobody!!


936
00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:23.950
孩子
Son


937
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.030
你很清楚如果不招出來會有什麼下場
you know what'll happen if you don't talk.


938
00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.860
你會被送去毒氣室所以你還是招了吧
You'll go to the gas chamber. So admit what you did.


939
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:33.970
我並不想傷害她
I didn't mean to hurt her.


940
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.730
說不定她沒事呢?
-Maybe she's okay.


941
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:38.000
沒事?
-Okay?


942
00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.900
他們全在停屍間了
They're all in the morgue.


943
00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:41.630
你走的時候他們就已經全死了
They were dead when you left them.


944
00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.900
我只不過是想要開苞而已嘛
I just wanted to lose my cherry.


945
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.510
她沒死的話我也就不用死了
She don't die, so I don't die.


946
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.140
她沒死所以我也不用死
She don't die, so I don't die.


947
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.650
路易斯  那個女孩是誰?
Louis, who's the girl?


948
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:52.180
她叫什麼名字?
What's her name?


949
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.580
你到底在說什麼?
Who are you talking about?


950
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.050
她是不是在夜貓子那兒?
Was she at the Nite Owl?


951
00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.280
路易斯  聽我說她是不是在夜貓子那兒?
Listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?


952
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:07.800
這份報紙在胡說八道
-This paper shit isn't shit!


953
00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.560
路易斯說的那個女孩在哪裏?
-Where's the girl?


954
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.170
你們殺了她嗎?
You kill her?


955
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:12.430
你們本來只是要讓路易斯開苞
Louis lost his cherry,


956
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.630
可是你們覺得還不過癮結果事情鬧得太過份了
but things got out of hand.


957
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.010
你們就打了那個女孩
You made her bleed.


958
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.410
她的血濺到你們的衣服上面
She bled on your clothes,


959
00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.510
所以你們把衣服燒了
so you burned the clothes.


960
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:20.740
誰說的?
Who said that?!


961
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.310
你給我聽好
Now, listen to me.


962
00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.610
如果她還活著的話
If she's alive,


963
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:25.080
她是你們活命的唯一機會了
she's the only chance you've got.


964
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.880
我想她還活著  你想?
-I think she's alive. -You think?


965
00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.490
那她在那裏?
Where is she now?


966
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.750
你們是不是把她丟哪裏?  還是把她賣了?
Did you leave her someplace?


967
00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.660
告訴我她在哪裏?
Where is she?


968
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.590
你在幹什麼?
What're you doing?


969
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:40.630
懷特
White!


970
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.130
六分之一的機會

971
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:44.030
她在哪裏?
Where's the girl?!


972
00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:45.570
懷特  我已經控制住狀況了
Put the weapon down!


973
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:47.870
把槍放下來  那個女孩在哪裏?
Where's the girl?!!


974
00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:54.750
希維思特之家
Sylvester Fitch


975
00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:55.780
什麼?

Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon


977
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.490
樓上角落的棕色房間
brown corner house, upstairs.


978
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.260
給我一分鐘的時間
-Just give me one minute.


979
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.500
沒有問題
-You got it.


980
00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.600
大家先別動
Nobody moves.


981
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:26.830
我們幾個從前門進去
We're going in the front.


982
00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.210
在我下令之前先別動
Stay put until I give the word.


983
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:55.890
他繞到後面去了
He went around back!


984
00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:58.990
我是艾斯利副組長
I'm Lieutenant Exley.


985
00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:00.260
對不起  這麼問你
I'm sorry to ask you this.


986
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.100
我需要知道他們什麼時候丟下你的
I need to know when they left you.


987
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.360
把她送到醫院去
Get her to the hospital.


988
00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.060
借過一下
Excuse me.


989
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:06.930
別一直急著陞官
Give your career a rest.


990
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:08.510
別去煩她
Leave her alone.


991
00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:09.800
一絲不掛的男人會用槍射你?
A naked guy with a gun?


992
00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.140
你認為會有人相信嗎?
Who'll believe that?


993
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:13.750
你離我遠一點
Get the fuck away from me.


994
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.970
你的報告寫出來會是什麼樣子
How'll it look in your report?


995
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.550
會像正義得到伸張
It'll look like justice.


996
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:18.410
這正是那個男人的下場
That's what the man got.


997
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:19.520
接受正義的制裁
Justice.


998
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.280
你根本不知道正義兩個字是什麼意思
You don't know the meaning of the word.


999
00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.550
是嗎?  你以為你的照片上報才叫做正義嗎?
You think it means getting your picture in the paper.


1000
00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:27.120
你要找  去找壞人的麻煩
Go after criminals for a change.


1001
00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:28.250
別老是找警察的麻煩
instead of cops


1002
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.800
史丹斯蘭他是活該  你也是
Stensland got what he deserved and so will you.


1003
00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.840
別那麼衝動  巴德
come on, bud


1004
00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.710
他那麼沖  你最好是離他遠一點
It's best to stay away when his blood is up.


1005
00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:49.470
他永遠是那麼沖的
His blood's always up.


1006
00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:53.450
或許你永遠都不應該靠近他
Perhaps you should stay away from him altogether.


1007
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:57.080
逃犯雷蒙克林斯  泰依瓊斯和路易斯方騰
Raymond Collins, Ty Jones and Louis Fontaine.


1008
00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.920
擁有槍械極為危險
They are considered armed and dangerous.


1009
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.390
重複 夜貓子案的嫌犯脫逃了
Repeat. The Nite Owl suspects have escaped.


1010
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.160
他們怎麼爬出窗戶去的?
How'd they get out the window?


1011
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:07.230
我們只知道他們從二樓跳下去
They jumped from the 2nd floor.


1012
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.630
醫院那個女孩做好筆錄了  說他們在十二點丟下她的
Girl said they left her at 12.


1013
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.630
他們很有可能在一點左右到了夜貓子那兒
They could get to the Nite Owl by 1.


1014
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.540
問題是他們那兒弄到毒品的
The question was, where did they get their drugs?


1015
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.610
我還沒有想到那兒去呢
I haven't gotten that far yet.


1016
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.740
羅蘭·那法瑞在木屋街有個據點
"Roland Navarette lives on Bunker Hill,


1017
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.010
各種毒品甚至連紅魔鬼都有
runs a hole-up"


1018
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:26.180
有沒有人看見傑克·文生?
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?


1019
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.650
有什麼事嗎?
Is something up?


1020
01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:31.150
我需要人支持  走
I need some backup. Go


1021
01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:50.840
怎麼了?  沒事  走吧
-What? -Nothing. Let's go.


1022
01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.750
應該就是這了
This should be it.


1023
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:07.100
404

1024
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:29.100
通通不許動
Nobody moves!


1025
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.010
不要動  你們被捕了
You're under arrest.


1026
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.090
不要開槍
Don't shoot, man!


1027
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.310
手舉起來  別動
Don't move! Don't move!


1028
01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.470
他來了
There he is.


1029
01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:32.410
你表現的很好  孩子
You did good, kid.


1030
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:35.980
你應該看看那個地方的到處都是血  像場惡夢
You should've seen this place. Blood everywhere.


1031
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.910
真是沒想到  散彈艾德!
Who would have thought? Shotgun Ed.


1032
01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:39.310
對  散彈艾德
Yes. Shotgun Ed.


1033
01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:41.220
誰帶他去包紮一下吧
Somebody get him cleaned up.


1034
01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.320
走吧  孩子
Come on.


1035
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:45.320
夜貓子屠殺案的破案英雄

1036
01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:49.020
埃德蒙艾斯利在洛杉磯警局服務了七年
Edmund J. Exley has amassed a brilliant record


1037
01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.330
當中表現異常優異
in his 7 years with the Los Angeles Police Department.


1038
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:55.560
最近在執勤的時候更是表現的非常英勇
Recently, he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty.


1039
01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:58.800
所以我們深感榮幸  能夠頒發給他我們的最高榮譽
It is our privilege to present him with our highest honor:


1040
01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.670
勇士獎章
The Medal of Valor.


1041
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:01.770
那是什麼車子?
-What kind of car was it? -It was a Ford.


1042
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:03.380
福特的  你確定嗎?
Ford. Are you sure?


1043
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.980
我先生總是開福特
My husband always drove a Ford.


1044
01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.570
所以我知道福特的樣子
I know what they look like.


1045
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:08.650
對不起夫人  說重點就好了
Excuse me, ma'am. Just the facts.


1046
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.020
是淺色還是暗色的?  淺色的
Light or dark? Light.


1047
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:14.250
我真的只記得這些了  警官
And that's really all I remember, Officer.


1048
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.580
謝謝你  你幫了我們大忙
Thank you. You've been a big help.


1049
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.950
卡  拿去沖印吧
Cut! That's a print.


1050
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.590
大傑克  他回來了
Big Jack! He's back!


1051
01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.820
傑克回來了
Jack's back.


1052
01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:00.260
告訴巴卻先生我不會改變的
Tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote.


1053
01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.940
有的人或許會感到驚訝
It may surprise some that


1054
01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:17.950
一個政治人物竟然能勇於認錯
an official would admit to making a mistake


1055
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.810
可是經過深思熟慮以後
but after due consideration


1056
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:24.080
我決定改變對此事的立場
I am changing my position on the matter before the council.


1057
01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:27.450
"西進吧  美國!  "
"Go west, America,"


1058
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.560
是當年政府的偉大號召
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.


1059
01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:33.550
今天西進步伐將完成最後一步
Today is that last step westward with no stop signs


1060
01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.960
因為從市中心一直到海邊
no traffic signals, from downtown


1061
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:38.630
二十分鐘的路程沿途沒有任何的紅綠燈
to the beach in 20 minutes.


1062
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:10.690
你想從那一行幹起?
What were you going to start with?


1063
01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.470
綠燈戶?
Prostitution?


1064
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.700
賭場?
Gambling?


1065
01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.280
回新澤西去吧  孩子
Go back to Jersey, sonny.


1066
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.410
這裏是天使之城
This is the City of the Angels


1067
01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:28.180
而你身上沒有翅膀
and you haven't got any wings.


1068
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:52.380
改天見  保重
Nice to see you again. Take care.


1069
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:34.050
我一直在想  你什麼時候會再來找我  懷特警員
I wondered when you'd knock on my door again, Officer White.


1070
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:36.780
叫我巴德
It's Bud.


1071
01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.360
巴德
Bud.


1072
01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.680
為什麼選上我?
Why me?


1073
01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.950
我不知道
I don't know.


1074
01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.790
這一次的選舉
This election


1075
01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.310
關繫著洛城警局的未來
is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles.


1076
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.790
而羅傑議員正代表著我們美好的未來
City Councilman Rogers represents that future.


1077
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.390
所以請大家慷慨解囊
So let's dig deep


1078
01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:02.270
協助一個高尚正直的人當選
and get a moral man re-elected.


1079
01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.470
我們現在歡迎艾利斯羅來說幾句話
Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.


1080
01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:07.650
謝謝你  佈雷特雀斯
Thank you, Brett Chase.


1081
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.810
警網群英中傑出的大明星
The talented star of Badge of Honor.


1082
01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:14.140
我可以告訴各位
Let me tell you,


1083
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.220
我今天能夠站在這裏覺得非常的榮幸
I am so thrilled to be here.


1084
01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.290
大文·傑克
Big V.


1085
01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.290
很高興看到你回來了
Good to see you back.


1086
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.550
最近勇猛十足吧
-How they hanging, Sid?


1087
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.630
都舉不起頭來了
-Down around my ankles.


1088
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:26.300
你跟檢察官很熟嗎?  傑克
You tight with the D.A., Jackie?


1089
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:27.490
很熟
Yes.


1090
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:30.740
他去年聖誕節還想讓我走路呢
Yeah. He tried to throw me off the force last Christmas.


1091
01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.530
想不想好好報個仇?
How about some payback, big-time?


1092
01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.540
另外我照常捐五十塊錢給傑克·文生的退休基金
Plus the usual 50 dollar donation to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.


1093
01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.300
你知道檢察官他是同性戀嗎?
-Did you know the D.A. was a swish?


1094
01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:40.210
真的嗎?
-No kidding?


1095
01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:44.960
你還記得麥特·雷諾嗎?
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?


1096
01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:46.540
去年的耶誕夜大明星首映場被捕
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?


1097
01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:48.550
他剛剛服完獄外役回來
-He just got off the honor farm.


1098
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.050
那他到這兒來幹什麼?
-What's he doing here?


1099
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:51.180
雷諾是個雙性戀
Reynolds is acey-deucey,


1100
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.720
如果有錢賺當然更起勁
not to mention broke.


1101
01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:55.610
我給了他一百塊錢讓他跟檢察官搞
I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for $100.


1102
01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:58.930
比你毀了他演藝生涯的酬勞還要多一倍
That's twice the $50 you got for wrecking his career.


1103
01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:01.360
過來
-Come here, come here.


1104
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.490
天哪!不要叫他過來
-Jesus, don't bring him--


1105
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:09.570
那邊那位就是羅檢察官
That's D.A. Loew right there.


1106
01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.870
好
Ok.


1107
01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.640
要不要先喝杯酒
You need a drink?


1108
01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.270
要
Yeah.


1109
01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.180
照顧他一下
Look after him.


1110
01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:22.910
麥特  這位是傑克
Matt, this is Jack.


1111
01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.720
我們之間沒有什麼秘密
No secrets between me and him.


1112
01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.060
你好嗎? 我很好  你呢?
-How you doing? -I'm okay. How're you?


1113
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.500
很好
I'm good.


1114
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:38.070
我們以前有沒有見過面?
Have we met before?


1115
01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.500
有
Yeah.


1116
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.080
是在宴會上嗎?
Was it at a party?


1117
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:46.140
跟今天的場合差不多
It was something like that.


1118
01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.370
法蘭西王朝的宴會對吧?
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?


1119
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.550
對
Right.


1120
01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:54.480
法蘭西王朝
Fleur-de-Lis.


1121
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.650
任君選擇
"Whatever you desire."


1122
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:59.970
毒品  長的像電影明星的女郎
Dope, hookers that look like movie stars.


1123
01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:02.420
皮爾斯·巴卻全都一應俱全
Pierce Patchett has it all.


1124
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.090
真是一點都沒錯
You could say that again.


1125
01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.930
皮爾斯跟其它的人不太一樣
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.


1126
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:10.900
我很喜歡他  不過
I dig him, but


1127
01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.970
你知道的  他也讓我很害怕
you know he scares me too.


1128
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:17.940
真的嗎?
Really?


1129
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.740
怎麼會呢?
How?


1130
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:25.350
我剛到洛杉機的時候根本沒想到會變成今天這樣
When I came out to L.A. this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.


1131
01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.320
是啊  大家都一樣
Yeah, well get in line.


1132
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.010
壯壯膽吧  孩子  乾杯
Your courage, kid. Drink up.


1133
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:38.890
我看還是不要好了
I don't think I should do this.


1134
01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:41.430
你又不是不知道怎麼做?
It's not like you don't know how.


1135
01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.550
傑克跟警網群英製作很熟的
Jack's connected to Badge of Honor.


1136
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.800
事情做好了他會替你爭取個角色的
Pull this off, you'll get a part.


1137
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:49.570
我看有人要東山再起了對不對  傑克?
I smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?


1138
01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.080
檢察官他有空了
The D.A.'s free.


1139
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:55.660
去自我介紹一下  快點
Go introduce yourself. Go on.


1140
01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:59.150
你說話啊  傑克告訴他你會替他爭取的
Tell him about the opening on the show.


1141
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.740
對  我有把握可以讓你上節目
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on this show.


1142
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.580
不過那是以後的事了
But that's later on.


1143
01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.620
今晚你應該假裝你是在演戲
Tonight, go on over there and pretend it's an acting job.


1144
01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:11.100
這也是演藝事業的一種
Like show biz.


1145
01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.820
演戲  沒錯
Acting, that's it.


1146
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.890
對  沒有人會知道對不對?
Right. No one's going to know about this?


1147
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.930
沒有
No.


1148
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.800
這是我們之間的秘密
It'll be our secret.


1149
01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.600
好  演藝事業
-Show biz.


1150
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.140
對  快去
-That's it. Go on.


1151
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.740
演藝事業
Show biz.


1152
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:35.880
如果雷諾施展他的魅力
If Reynolds works his charms,


1153
01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.080
而我知道他會的
which I know he will


1154
01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:40.800
那他們待會應該會在好萊塢中心旅館203房
they'll be at the Hollywood Center Motel, room 203.


1155
01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:43.660
子夜的時候到那兒等我好拍照
Meet me there at midnight for a photo shoot.


1156
01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.360
說不定這一次可以把  好萊塢那個大招牌給照進去
And maybe we can work in the Hollywood sign this time.


1157
01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:51.230
你對皮爾巴卻瞭解多少
What do you know about Pierce Patchett?


1158
01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:53.000
跟你一樣所知不多
I know what you know.


1159
01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:53.840
他很有錢
He's rich.


1160
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:57.280
然後把錢拿去蓋高速公路了  使得它變的更有錢了
Invested in the freeways, which'll make him richer.


1161
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:58.840
你幹嘛問這個?
Why?


1162
01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:01.540
我不斷聽到一些謠言
I just keep hearing rumors, you know.


1163
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.310
什麼高檔應召站  毒品
High-class porn, drugs,


1164
01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.540
長的像電影明星的妓女
hookers that look like movie stars.


1165
01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:07.450
巴卻是那種不惹眼的人物
Patchett's what I call twilight.


1166
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:09.380
他舉止也不古怪  也不是共產黨
He isn't queer or Red.


1167
01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.010
根本沒什麼新奇刺激的故事可以讓我寫的
He cannot help me in my quest for prime sinnuendo.


1168
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.300
就好像警網群英的製作人不會找那傢伙演戲一樣
As though Badge of Honor would touch that guy with a 10-foot pole


1169
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.360
因為他一年當中二度當上我雜誌的封面人物
after he's been Hush-Hush cover boy twice in one year.


1170
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:27.830
待會見
See you soon.


1171
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.470
子夜  我保證定會非常緊張刺激的
Midnight. I guarantee all kinds of illegal activity.


1172
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:07.680
再來一杯?  對
Another? Yeah.


1173
01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:38.740
好萊塢中心汽車旅館

1174
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:52.820
小子
Kid?


1175
01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:00.760
兄弟
Brother.


1176
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.200
好了  你犯不著幹這種事
Come on, you don't have to do this--


1177
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.730
非常謝謝你為我報仇
Thank you for what you did for me


1178
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.530
殺了那些強暴我的禽獸
for killing those animals who raped me.


1179
01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:43.610
請你替我謝謝懷特警員好嗎
Will you thank Officer White for me, please?


1180
01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:44.770
當然
Sure.


1181
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:50.280
我現在腦海裏只記得  看見他從那個門走過來
Seeing him come through the door is about the only thing I remember.


1182
01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.470
真是謝天謝地
Thank God.


1183
01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.520
你還記得那些黑人什麼時候丟下你嗎?
You remember what time the Negroes left you, right?


1184
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.790
你在供詞中說
In your statement,


1185
01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.950
他們是子夜的時候離開你的
you said they left you at midnight.


1186
01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:00.460
可能是吧?
They might have.


1187
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:07.300
你這麼說是什麼意思?
They "might" have?


1188
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:09.060
我不知道他們什麼時候離開我
I don't know what time they left me.


1189
01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.230
我只希望他們死
I wanted them dead.


1190
01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:14.830
如果他們沒有殺死夜貓子那些白人
Would anyone care that they raped a Mexican girl


1191
01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:18.530
會有任何人在乎  他們強暴了一個墨西哥女孩嗎?
if they hadn't killed those white people at the Nite Owl?


1192
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:21.170
我這一切都是為了報仇
I did what I had to do for justice.


1193
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:22.180
英奈茲
Inez.


1194
01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.750
艾利斯也在  過來
Exley, over here.


1195
01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:25.680
笑一下  英奈茲
Smile, Inez.


1196
01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:28.810
他是你的大英雄吧
Is he your hero?


1197
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.080
各位  這個標題怎麼樣?
Fellas, how about this?


1198
01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.920
"夜貓子案英雄推著被害人走出醫院 "
"Rape Victim Wheeled Out by Nite Owl Hero."


1199
01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:40.890
他們只得到了薇洛妮卡雷克
All they get is Veronica Lake.


1200
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.630
而我得到琳恩瑪格莉特佈雷肯
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.


1201
01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.240
比斯比
"Bisbee?"


1202
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:01.620
我在那兒長大的
I grew up there.


1203
01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.390
我過幾年要回那兒去
I'm going back in a couple of years,


1204
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:08.590
開一家服裝店
open up a dress shop.


1205
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.530
比斯比的女孩需要好衣服打扮
The girls in Bisbee need a little glamour.


1206
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.760
這疤是怎來的?
Where'd this come from?


1207
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:25.040
我當年十二歲  我爸拿著酒瓶要砸我媽
I was 12. My dad went after my mother with a bottle.


1208
01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.410
我正好擋在中間
I got in the way.


1209
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:29.740
所以是你救了你媽的?
So you saved her.


1210
01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.850
也救不了她多久
Not for long.


1211
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.460
很對不起  這不關我的事的
-I'm sorry. It's none of my business.


1212
01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.990
他把我綁在暖氣機上面
-He tied me to the radiator.


1213
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:43.080
我看著他用熨斗把我媽打死
I watched him beat my mother to death with a tire iron


1214
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.360
然後他把我丟在那兒
and he left me there.


1215
01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:52.760
三天後學校督學才發現我們
Three days before a truant officer found us.


1216
01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.970
警方一直沒有找到我老頭
They never found the old man.


1217
01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.610
所以你才當警察的?
Is that why you became a cop?


1218
01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.650
為了討個公道?
To get even?


1219
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:13.950
或許吧
Maybe.


1220
01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.530
你喜歡當警察嗎?
Do you like it?


1221
01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.990
以前喜歡
I used to.


1222
01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.340
如今這差事卻變成恃強凌弱了
Now it's all strong-arm, sitting duck stuff.


1223
01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:29.070
如果
If I could


1224
01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:33.340
如果我能有機會到兇殺組去
get a chance to work Homicide


1225
01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.410
像真正的刑警一樣辦案
like a real detective.


1226
01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.020
那個痞子艾斯利他殺錯人了
That prick, Exley, he shot the wrong guys.


1227
01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:41.710
殺死史丹斯蘭的人還逍遙法外
Whoever killed Stensland's still around.


1228
01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:44.520
我內心裏很清楚  我知道
I know it in here. I know it.


1229
01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.390
夜貓子那件案子不太對勁
Something's wrong with the Nite Owl.


1230
01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:49.260
只是我沒辦法證明而已
I just can't prove it, that's all.


1231
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:52.620
我不夠聰明
I'm not smart enough.


1232
01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:57.900
我只是上頭長官用來嚇唬別人的工具而已
I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.


1233
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:02.630
你錯了
You're wrong.


1234
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:06.540
你找到巴卻  你找到了我
You found Patchett. You found me.


1235
01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.480
你已經夠聰明了
You're smart enough.


1236
01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:22.660
巴德·懷特  什麼風把你吹到地下室來的?
Bud White! What brings you down to the basement?


1237
01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.000
我有幾個夜貓子案的問題想要問你
I got a couple of Nite Owl questions.


1238
01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.160
不知道你有沒有看過報紙
Don't know if you read the papers,


1239
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.660
那個案子已經結了
but that case is closed.


1240
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:36.710
你有沒有那裏覺得不對勁的
Anything bother you about it?


1241
01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.300
有  就是那些送貨的  還沒把這些東西給抬走
The fact that the pack-up boys haven't hauled this shit out of here yet.


1242
01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:49.280
我們查到嫌犯的三把散彈鎗彈道跟夜貓子的彈殼一致
The suspects' 3 shotguns match the strike marks on the shell casings.


1243
01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:52.520
你還要什麼證據?
What more do you want?


1244
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.330
掛照片的牆上有血
There's blood on the wall here.


1245
01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:09.010
不是除了廚子以外的人  都是在男廁所被殺的嗎?
I thought everyone got shot in the men's room.


1246
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:11.740
那是史丹斯蘭的血
That is Stensland's blood.


1247
01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.570
史丹斯?  對
Stensland? Yeah.


1248
01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:14.740
他頭上被狠狠挨了一記
Blow to the head.


1249
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.350
兇手把他拖到男廁時他可能已經昏迷了
Probably unconscious when they dragged him in the john.


1250
01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.310
他們有沒有打其它的人?
Did they hit anyone else?


1251
01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:22.090
沒有  不過他是個警察
No, but he was a cop.


1252
01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.850
可能想要反抗吧
Probably tried to do something.


1253
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:29.520
吉士三明治  黑咖啡
Grilled cheese, black coffee.


1254
01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.600
有人跟他坐在一起
Someone was sitting next to him.


1255
01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.170
有兩個被害人是女的  對吧

1256
01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.070
對  派蒂·杜魯卡  夜班女服務生
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift waitress,


1257
01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.700
還有一位叫做蘇珊·雷佛
and a Susan Lefferts.


1258
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:47.600
蘇珊·雷佛?
Susan Lefferts.


1259
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.610
對  怎麼樣?
Yeah, what about her?


1260
01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.950
不用客氣
You're welcome!


1261
01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:59.120
雷佛太太
Mrs. Lefferts


1262
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:02.690
雷佛太太
Mrs. Lefferts?


1263
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:05.460
我是洛杉磯警局的懷特警員
I'm Officer White, LAPD.


1264
01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:11.060
談談你那天在法院提到的你女兒的那位男友好嗎?
Tell me about the boyfriend you mentioned at the coroner's office.


1265
01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.210
我跟你們說過  我不喜歡她那個男朋友
I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.


1266
01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.270
他那麼老了跟你不配
He was too old for you.


1267
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:18.470
你還讓他對我那麼兇
And you let him be fresh with me.


1268
01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:23.350
有一天我不在家的時候  他們到我家來
They came here one day when I wasn't home.


1269
01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.350
隔壁的簡森太太她說
Mrs. Jensen next door said


1270
01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.210
她看見蘇珊的男朋友跟另外一個男人在一起
she saw Susie's boyfriend and another man and


1271
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:31.450
她還說她聽見一陣騷動
she heard a ruckus.


1272
01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.050
你女兒的男朋友叫什麼名字?
What was his name?


1273
01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:36.220
他根本就沒有跟我介紹
We weren't properly introduced.


1274
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.890
蘇珊都叫他沐恩魯恩什麼的
Susie gave him a nickname, Muns or Luns.


1275
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:40.430
史丹恩?
Stens?


1276
01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:41.620
是不是史丹恩?
Was it Stens?


1277
01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.000
或許是吧
Maybe.


1278
01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:44.160
我不知道
I don't know.


1279
01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.500
你看看照片
Look.


1280
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.030
就是他
That's him.


1281
01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:51.970
就是他
That's him.


1282
01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:58.710
你說鄰居聽到騷動
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.


1283
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.380
是在外面嗎?還是裏面?
Was it outside? Inside?


1284
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.380
在外面
Outside.


1285
01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:09.050
簡森太太說他們一直吵吵到房子下面去了
And then Mrs. Jensen said they kept going under the house.


1286
01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.490
你該走了  警察先生
You have to leave now, officer.


1287
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:17.100
這兒過去是那裏?
-What's through here?


1288
01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.030
放雜物的房間
-Just a room full of old things.


1289
01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:21.400
不要動它
Don't move that!


1290
01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.240
不要理會那股種臭味了
Don't mind the smell.


1291
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.640
大概是有老鼠死在牆後面了
I think a rat died behind the wall.


1292
01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.350
我的蘇珊是個好女孩
My Susie was a good girl.


1293
01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.150
她從來沒有惹過任何麻煩的
She was never in any kind of trouble at all!


1294
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:48.190
李蘭·米克斯? 沒聽過
"Leland Meeks." Never heard of you.


1295
01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.490
他們都叫我巴茲
They call me Buzz.


1296
01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.070
是不是老鼠?
Was it a rat?


1297
01:22:59.170 --> 01:23:00.900
對  好大一隻
Yeah, a great big one.


1298
01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.270
拿去
Here.


1299

洛杉磯警察局的一點心意

本周兇殺旅館最迷人的胃
Stomach of the week from a motel homicide.


1301
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:31.250
這位失業的演員吃過熱狗  薯條  酒
Unemployed actor had frankfurter, French fries, alcohol and sperm.


1302
01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.120
還有精液  好豐盛的最後晚餐對不對?
Hell of a last supper, don't you think?


1303
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:37.300
夜貓子那個案子你有沒有覺得不對勁?
Anything bothering you about the Nite Owl case?


1304
01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.570
有  就是你們一直纏著不放
That you guys won't let it get filed away.


1305
01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:41.700
這是什麼意思?
-What do you mean?


1306
01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.820
巴德·懷特他今天也來問過我
-Bud White grilled me on it today.


1307
01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.310
巴德·懷特?
Bud White?


1308
01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.640
他沒有我想的那麼笨
He's not as dumb as I thought.


1309
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:54.020
他跟你說過話後  有沒有說跟你說過要去哪裏
Did he say where he was going after he talked to you?


1310
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:08.570
讓我的女兒安息吧
Let my daughter rest in peace!


1311
01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.830
雷佛太太  我想問你一些問題
Mrs. Lefferts, I want to ask a few questions.


1312
01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:13.910
懷特警官已經去下面看過了
Officer White already checked under the house.


1313
01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:15.740
屋子下面?
Under the house?


1314
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.820
那裏?  外面後頭
-Where? -Out back.


1315
01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.450
他只找到老鼠而已
All he found was rodents.


1316
01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:26.620
盡快幫我查明死者身份
I need an I.D. on this as soon as possible.


1317
01:24:26.730 --> 01:24:28.160
而且你只能向我報告
Talk only to me on this one.


1318
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:31.400
影星首映場前吸毒被捕

1319
01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:33.090
文生  我有件事需要你幫忙
I need your help.


1320
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:36.670
我現在很忙你為什麼不找你們兇殺組同仁
I'm busy right now. Why don't you ask your boys in Homicide?


1321
01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.440
不行  我需要兇殺組以外的人
I can't. I need someone outside of Homicide.


1322
01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.230
我要你跟蹤巴得懷特直到他今天晚上去值勤為止
Tail Bud White until he goes on duty this evening.


1323
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.410
幫幫忙  離我遠一點吧
Do me a real favor and leave me alone.


1324
01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.210
你相信那三個黑人是夜貓子案的兇手嗎?
You make the Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?


1325
01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.750
什麼?
What?


1326
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.720
這是很簡單的問題
It's a simple question.


1327
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:06.930
你為什麼還要去追查夜貓子的案件呢?
Why in the world do you want to dig deeper into the Nite Owl killings


1328
01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.330
副組長
Lieutenant?


1329
01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:12.900
羅羅·湯馬西
Rollo Tomasi.


1330
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:17.610
你還要給我其它提示還是要我開始猜了?
Is there more or do I have to guess?


1331
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:23.010
羅羅是個扒手
Rollo was a purse snatcher.


1332
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:28.680
先父有一次下了班後捉到他
My father ran into him off-duty.


1333
01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:34.620
他朝我父親開了六槍卻逃之夭夭
He shot my father 6 times and got away clean.


1334
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:37.860
沒有人知道他真實的身份
No one knew who he was.


1335
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.530
我為了讓這個人真實一點  所以給他取了這個名字
I made the name up to give him personality.


1336
01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.860
你到底想講什麼?
What's your point?


1337
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.440
羅羅·湯馬西是我成為警察的原動力
Rollo Tomasi's the reason I became a cop.


1338
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:48.300
我一心想要捉到
I wanted to catch the guys...


1339
01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.070
那些自以為可以逍遙法外的人
who thought they could get away with it.


1340
01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.640
我希望能夠尋得天道公理
It was supposed to be about justice.


1341
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.910
可是慢慢的我失去了那份理想
Then somewhere along the way I lost sight of that.


1342
01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.820
你為什麼當警察?
Why'd you become a cop?


1343
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:15.770
我不記得了
I don't remember.


1344
01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:24.610
你到底要什麼?  艾斯利
What do you want, Exley?


1345
01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:26.770
我希望能破了這個案子
I want to solve this thing.


1346
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:29.110
夜貓子已經破了
Nite Owl was solved.


1347
01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.310
沒有
No.


1348
01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.380
我希望能夠真正的破案
I want to do it right.


1349
01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:36.220
即使是你必須付出慘痛代價
Even if it means paying the consequences?


1350
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:41.690
好  大學生  我幫你
All right, college boy, I'll help.


1351
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:44.390
不過有個案子  你們兇殺組根本不在乎
But there's a case your boys in Homicide don't care about.


1352
01:26:44.530 --> 01:26:48.230
他們認為只是稀鬆平常的命案
They think it's just another Hollywood "homo"-cide.


1353
01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.460
可是我不認為
But I don't.


1354
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.090
你幫我查我的案子
You help me with mine,


1355
01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.170
我就幫你查你的案子
I'll help you with yours.


1356
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:54.970
一言為定?
Deal?


1357
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:56.340
一言為定
Deal.


1358
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:30.100
強寧·史當巴那多
Johnny Stompanato.


1359
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.980
溫德爾懷特警員  你好嗎? 老兄
Officer Wendell White. How's tricks, paesano?


1360
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:36.980
沒興趣
I amn't your paesano.


1361
01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.270
我也不再幹線人了
I amn't in the snitch business anymore.


1362
01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.550
認識一個叫巴茲·米克斯的嗎
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?


1363
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:45.120
他是皮爾斯·巴卻的手下
Works for Pierce Patchett.


1364
01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.550
我應該認識他嗎?
Should I?


1365
01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:50.420
你是保鏢  米克斯也是保鏢
You're muscle for hire. Meeks is muscle for hire.


1366
01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.690
你說呢?
You tell me.


1367
01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.860
哦對  我現在記起來了
Yeah, I remember now.


1368
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:57.770
米克斯是個過氣的老警察了
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.


1369
01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:59.940
有一天你也會跟他一樣的
Same as you're going to be some day.


1370
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:02.270
我只說到這裏了
That's all you'll get.


1371
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:04.810
二十塊錢你自己留著吧
Keep your 20 bucks.


1372
01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.940
如果我把你的鳥蛋還給你 你能夠告訴我什麼? 傻蛋
What do I get if I give you your balls back, you wop cocksucker?


1373
01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.060
道上在盛傳
There was a rumor going around


1374
01:28:20.190 --> 01:28:23.750
米克斯跟朋友弄到了一大批的海洛因
that Meeks had a line on a large supply of H.


1375
01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:26.900
然後呢?
And?


1376
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:28.190
沒有然後了
And nothing!


1377
01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:30.760
他拿著貨溜了
He skipped out.


1378
01:28:42.810 --> 01:28:44.750
胡說
Bullshit.


1379
01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:48.750
米克斯那種人哪有辦法弄到大量海洛因
How would Meeks get his hands on a large supply of heroin?


1380
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.150
你說的對
You're right.


1381
01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:52.280
可能是胡說八道的吧
It's probably bullshit.


1382
01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.980
就算他拿到了他也沒辦法賣
Even if he did, he could never unload it.


1383
01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:58.260
因為那只會搞的他一身騷
Not without drawing all kinds of attention.


1384
01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.230
或許就是這樣
Maybe that's why


1385
01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:05.530
他才會躺在別人的地下室渾身發臭呢
he's under a house in Elysian Park not smelling too good paesano.


1386
01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.120
或許懷特真的沒那麼笨哦
Maybe White's not so dumb after all.


1387
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:15.200
麗泰·海華躺在停屍間了
We got Rita Hayworth at the morgue,


1388
01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.500
而薇洛妮卡跟懷特在一起
and now Veronica Lake with White.


1389
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.510
我想你的案子跟我的案子似乎有所關聯
I think your case and my case are connected.


1390
01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.170
全都扯上了法蘭西王朝
It's Fleur-de-Lis again.


1391
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:24.440
法蘭西王朝?
Fleur-de-Lis?


1392
01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.880
任君選擇
"Whatever you desire."


1393
01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.780
應召站
Porno.


1394
01:30:27.790 --> 01:30:30.690
整容得像電影明星的高價妓女
High-class whores cut to look like movie stars.


1395
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:33.300
誰知道還有什麼名堂
Who knows what else.


1396
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:34.550
雷諾  那個被殺的小伙子  他也跟法蘭西王朝有關
Reynolds, the kid that got killed, was involved.


1397
01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:36.390
皮爾斯·巴卻也是
So is Pierce Patchett.


1398
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:38.120
那個百萬富翁?
The millionaire?


1399
01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.960
我想我們應該去找他談談
I think we should go talk to him.


1400
01:30:41.170 --> 01:30:42.720
不過現在去問問史當巴那多
First I want to brace Stompanato.


1401
01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.450
要不要簽名?
Want an autograph?


1402
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:02.640
寫信到米高梅(電影公司)吧
Write to MGM.


1403
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:06.380
什麼時候開始  龜公跟妓女也給起簽名照了
Since when do two-bit hoods and hookers give out autographs?


1404
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:07.510
你剛剛說什麼?
What?


1405
01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:09.020
洛杉磯警察  坐下
LAPD. Sit down.


1406
01:31:09.190 --> 01:31:10.920
你到底以為你是誰?
Who in the hell do you think you are?


1407
01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:13.490
出去走一走吧  親愛的  要不然可要請你到局裏去了
Take a walk, honey.Before I send you to downtown…


1408
01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:15.500
你犯了天大的錯誤
-You are making a large mistake.


1409
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.590
滾遠一點
-Get away from our table.


1410
01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:18.270
閉嘴
Shut up.


1411
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:21.840
長的像拉娜·透納的妓女還是個妓女
A hooker cut to look like Lana Turner is still a hooker.


1412
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.030
她只是長的像拉娜·透納
-She just looks like Lana Turner.


1413
01:31:24.210 --> 01:31:25.900
她就是拉娜·透納
-She is Lana Turner.


1414
01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.010
- 什麼? - 她就是拉娜·透納
- What? - She is Lana Turner.


1415
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:39.260
我怎麼會知道呢?
How was I supposed to know?


1416
01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:00.050
我相信夜貓子那件案子正是你的傑作  艾斯利先生
I believe the Nite Owl's your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.


1417
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.520
我在電視上看到你接受獎章
I saw you on television getting your medal.


1418
01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:05.850
而你
And you're


1419
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:09.430
是另一個好萊塢明星警察  對不對?
that other Hollywood celebrity policeman, aren't you?


1420
01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.700
長的向薇洛妮卡的那個女孩是為你工作的
The Veronica Lake look-alike works for you.


1421
01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.490
她是你旗下女郎之一  對不對?
She's one of your whores.


1422
01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.760
說的真難聽
A vulgar term.


1423
01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:19.430
她為什麼跟巴德·懷特在一起
Why's she seeing Bud White?


1424
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:22.770
男女為什麼在一起呢?
Why do men and women usually see each other?


1425
01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:27.770
我們換個話題好了
Let's try this on for size:


1426
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:29.180
法蘭西王朝
Fleur-de-Lis.


1427
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.550
任君選擇
"Whatever you desire."


1428
01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.020
還有一個叫麥特·雷諾的演員
An actor named Matt Reynolds.


1429
01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:37.820
沒聽過  一點都不知道?
No? Nothing?


1430
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:42.250
我們需要一些答案
We want some answers.


1431
01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:46.660
每個人不都是有所求嗎?
We all want something.


1432
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:50.700
這傢伙非常沉著冷靜
The guy's as cool as they come.


1433
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:56.240
艾斯利警官請回答  完畢

- This is Exley. - The coroner wants to talk to you.


1435
01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.250
他說他已經查出屍體身份了
He says he has your I.D.


1436
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.440
告訴他文生警官會去找他的
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him.


1437
01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:05.580
好的  瞭解
Yeah.


1438
01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:06.740
我送你回去開你的車
-I'll drop you at your car.


1439
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:07.820
那你要去那裏?

1440
01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.440
琳恩那兒

1441

1442

我們到狂歡酒吧見面
See you at the Frolic Room.


1443

太妙了  你找美女

1444
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.630
而我得去找法醫
I get the coroner.


1445
01:33:28.410 --> 01:33:31.100
獨家秘聞的噓噓雜誌
Hush-Hush, off the record and on the q.t.


1446
01:33:34.110 --> 01:33:36.090
喂  我正要過去找你
I was just coming up to see you.


1447
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.510
已經查出身份了嗎?
You get that I.D.?


1448
01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:40.810
還好有牙齒的記錄  死者過去是名警察
Thank God for dental records. Stiff used to be a cop.


1449
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:42.390
李蘭·米克斯
Leland Meeks.


1450
01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:43.420
巴茲·米克斯?
Buzz Meeks?


1451
01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.280
你認識他嗎?
-You knew him?


1452
01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:47.320
聽說過  我進警界時他還在局裏
-Of him. He was around when I joined the force.


1453
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:48.530
名聲很壞  謝了
Bad rep. Thanks.


1454
01:33:48.690 --> 01:33:50.930
說重點就好了
"Just the facts," Jack.


1455
01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.430
說重點就好了
"Just the facts."


1456
01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.220
還有其它事嗎?警官
Anything else?


1457
01:33:57.370 --> 01:33:59.460
米克斯在39到41年在風化組幹過
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39-'41.


1458
01:33:59.670 --> 01:34:01.110
我要看看他的抓人記錄
I need to see his arrest records.


1459
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:11.280
佈雷肯小姐  我是艾斯利警官
Miss Bracken I'm Lieutenant Exley.


1460

我知道你是誰

1461

你的事巴德全跟我說了

1462
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:16.550
是嗎?
Is that so?


1463
01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.210
懷特他說了什麼?
And what did White have to say?


1464
01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.530
他說你很聰明
He said you were smart.


1465
01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.250
他還說你是個懦夫
He also said you were a coward,


1466
01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:28.030
為了功名不計一切
and that you'd screw yourself to get ahead.


1467
01:34:28.170 --> 01:34:30.660
你只要記住我很聰明就好了
Let's concentrate on my smarts.


1468
01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.400
你是皮爾斯·巴卻塑造出來的對不對?
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?


1469
01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:35.470
他教你如何打扮說話、思考
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.


1470
01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:39.010
他的成就真是令人側目
I am very impressed with the results.


1471
01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:41.410
可是我希望你回答我一些問題
But I need answers.


1472
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:45.140
否則我就把你跟巴卻抓起來
And if I don't get them, I'll take you and Patchett down.


1473
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.050
皮爾斯他會照顧他自己的
Pierce Patchett can take care of himself.


1474
01:34:49.190 --> 01:34:50.820
而我根本不怕你
And I'm not afraid of you.


1475
01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.790
你似乎忘記了一件事情  警官
And you forget one thing, Lieutenant


1476
01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:57.730
皮爾斯也教我如何跟男人搞
Pierce also taught me how to fuck.


1477
01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:03.430
而且由他指定跟誰搞
And he tells you who to fuck.


1478
01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:05.300
你為什麼和巴德·懷特上床
Why does he have you fucking Bud White?


1479
01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.410
你為什麼認為我不是自願跟巴德交往的呢?
What makes you think I'm not seeing Bud because I want to?


1480
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:13.410
如果我別有居心的話  你心裏會舒坦一點對不對
It would be easier for you if there was an angle, wouldn't it?


1481
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:17.770
你害怕巴德  因為你根本沒有辦法控制他
You're afraid of Bud because you can't figure out how to play him.


1482
01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.820
他不像你一樣玩弄那一套把戲
He doesn't follow the same rules of politics as you do.


1483
01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.610
所以使得他變得很危險
It makes him dangerous.


1484
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:26.420
我可以應付得了他
I can handle Bud White.


1485
01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:27.490
可以嗎?
Can you?


1486
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.690
我見巴德是因為我想
I see Bud because I want to.


1487
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:40.500
我見巴德是因為  他散發出一股善良的本性
I see Bud because he can't hide the good inside of him.


1488
01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.040
我見巴德是因為  他使我覺得自己是琳恩·佈雷肯
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken


1489
01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:48.540
而不是長的像薇洛妮卡見錢眼開的妓女
and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.


1490
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:55.180
我見巴德是因為他永遠不會隱藏自己
I see Bud because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.


1491
01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:00.590
我會見巴德是因為他跟你截然不同
I see Bud for all the ways he's different from you.


1492
01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:05.890
不要低估我
Don't underestimate me.


1493
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:08.590
就像你低估巴德·懷特那樣?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?


1494
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:18.400
搞我跟搞懷特是不同的
Fucking me and fucking Bud aren't the same thing.


1495
01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:20.170
不要再提巴德·懷特了
Stop talking about Bud White.


1496
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:51.480
該死
Shit.


1497
01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.120
傑克·文生
Jack Vincennes.


1498
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:09.520
快午夜了，傑克
It's going on midnight.


1499
01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.720
一下子就好了  杜德利
I need 2 minutes, Dudley.


1500
01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:13.490
很重要的事
It's important.


1501
01:37:13.630 --> 01:37:15.030
算你運氣好
Good thing for you...


1502
01:37:15.130 --> 01:37:17.970
我老婆跟女兒都到海邊渡假了
My wife and daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.


1503
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:23.560
你記得巴茲·米克斯嗎?  杜德利
Do you remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?


1504
01:37:23.710 --> 01:37:26.140
那是警界的恥辱
A disgrace as a police officer.


1505
01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.080
他歷任的長官都說
Straight D fitness reports from every C.O.


1506
01:37:28.210 --> 01:37:31.210
他根本不適合當警察  為什麼?
he ever served under. Why?


1507
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:34.010
十二年前  他跟迪克史丹斯一起進行一次大掃黃

1508
01:37:34.150 --> 01:37:37.590
他們就一宗恐嚇案偵訊皮爾斯·巴卻
They questioned Pierce Patchett about a blackmail scam.


1509
01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.520
當時案情是巴卻叫西德把前景看好的政治家
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing prominent...


1510
01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:41.460
跟妓女上床的鏡頭給拍了下來
businessmen with hookers.


1511
01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.350
反正  最後罪名撤銷了
Anyway, charges were dropped.


1512
01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:45.860
因為罪證不足
Insufficient evidence.


1513
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.830
你是當時那件案子的督察長官
You were the supervising officer on that case.


1514
01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:50.230
不知道你還記不記得這件事
Remember anything about it?


1515
01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:53.260
這到底是怎麼回事?小伙子
What's this about, boy?


1516
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:57.970
這是跟我還有艾斯利在偵辦的案子有關
It has to do with a murder I've been working with Ed Exley on.


1517
01:37:58.110 --> 01:38:00.740
你是緝毒組的不是兇殺組的
You're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.


1518
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:03.910
你什麼時候開始跟艾斯利一起合作了?
Since when do you work with Edmund Exley?


1519
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:06.780
我只是私底下調查一下
It's a private investigation.


1520
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:11.050
我捅出了一些簍子  希望能亡羊補牢
I messed something up. I'm trying to make amends.


1521
01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:14.160
別跟人家一樣扮什麼正義俠士
Don't start trying to do the right thing, boyo.


1522
01:38:14.290 --> 01:38:15.760
你根本是門外漢
You haven't had the practice.


1523
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:25.100
巴茲·米克斯跟狄克·史丹斯
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.


1524
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.070
那艾斯利他有什麼看法呢?
So, what does Exley make of this?


1525
01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:34.870
我還沒有告訴他  我剛剛從記錄室那兒過來的
I haven't told him yet. I just came from the records room.


1526
01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:03.440
你還有沒有什麼遺言?  小伙子
Have you a valediction, boyo?


1527
01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:14.110
羅羅·湯馬西
Rollo Tomasi.


1528
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:38.440
文生是被一把點三二的手槍  射中心臟死的
Sergeant Vincennes was killed by a.32 slug to the heart.


1529
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:41.480
死亡時間大約是深夜一點鐘
Time of death, approximately 1 a.m.


1530
01:39:41.610 --> 01:39:43.170
雖然屍體是在艾克公園發現的
Although he was found in Echo Park,


1531
01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.550
可是法醫認定屍體被疑犯動過
forensics indicates the body was moved.


1532
01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:51.210
我希望能夠兩人一組  徹底掃蕩整個地區
I want 2-man teams to scour that entire neighborhood.


1533
01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:56.480
務必迅如閃電鐵血無情的  把兇手給抓出來
Our justice must be swift and merciless.


1534
01:39:58.700 --> 01:39:59.760
完畢
That is all.


1535
01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.100
埃德蒙  可以跟你談一下嗎
Might I have a word with you?


1536
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:17.540
我們想追查文生的一位朋友
We're trying to run down a lead on an associate of Vincennes.


1537
01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:20.850
可是一查下去卻是個死胡同
The records check has led to a dead end.


1538
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:22.280
那個人叫什麼名字?
What's the name?


1539
01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:23.890
羅羅·湯馬西
Rollo Tomasi?


1540
01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:27.590
你有沒有聽文生提起過他?
You ever heard Vincennes mention him?


1541
01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:32.290
沒有  沒有聽過
No. No, I haven't.


1542
01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.290
這可能沒有什麼
It's probably nothing. Still


1543
01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:42.360
不過你還是注意一下好嗎?
keep your eyes open, boyo.


1544
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.720
我知道是不太可能  不過假設
I know it's unlikely, but suppose,


1545
01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:55.580
只是假設
just for a moment


1546
01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.660
有人拿到了一大批海洛因
somebody had a lot of heroin,


1547
01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.160
你看他會拿去賣給誰?
who would they go to move it?


1548
01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:01.420
懷特  到我辦公室來
White, in my office.


1549
01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.550
好的
Captain.


1550
01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:04.890
快一點  隨便說一個嘛
Look, just give me a name.


1551
01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:06.090
米奇·柯漢
Mickey Cohen.


1552
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:16.330
組長  我需要你到勝利旅館去一趟
Captain? I could use your fearsome habits at the Victory Motel.


1553
01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.610
什麼時候?
When?


1554
01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:22.040
現在  溫德爾
Now.


1555
01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.780
把門關起來
Close the door, lad.


1556
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:35.920
我最近實在搞不懂你
You're a bit of a puzzlement to me these days.


1557
01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:38.660
怎麼好像變的軟趴趴
You don't seem your old cruel self.


1558
01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.630
我對你的未來可是有著深遠的打算的
And I had such grand plans for your future.


1559
01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:42.960
什麼打算?
What plans?


1560
01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.970
你當然會有自己的一些私事  我也一樣
You have your extracurricular activities and I have mine.


1561
01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:54.440
不過咱們改天得找個時間  好好談談我們的未來
We must have a clarification session one of these days.


1562
01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:59.250
不過眼前呢
However right now


1563
01:41:59.390 --> 01:42:03.080
我們要偵訊一個  知道是誰殺死傑克·文生的人
we'll brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes.


1564
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:04.990
所以現在的問題是
So the question is


1565
01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.390
我可以信任你嗎?可不可以?
can I count on you, lad?


1566
01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.920
可以  長官
-Yes or no? -Yes, sir.


1567
01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:17.660
我要知道你昨晚到底跟傑克談了些什麼
I want to know everything you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night.


1568
01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.740
就從屍體的身份開始
Start with the I.D. on the corpse.


1569
01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.200
那個死者以前是一位警察
An ex-cop.


1570
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:23.330
李蘭巴茲·米克斯
Leland "Buzz" Meeks.


1571
01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:25.270
以前是警察?
An ex-cop?


1572
01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:27.310
傑克怎麼說?他認識他嗎?
Did Jack know him?


1573
01:42:27.450 --> 01:42:29.280
只是聽說過而已
Only by reputation.


1574
01:42:35.690 --> 01:42:38.050
溫德爾  這位是西·德哈金斯
This is Sid Hudgens.


1575
01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:38.990
我願意合作
I'm willing to cooperate.


1576
01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:40.750
沒有必要把我綁起來
No need to tie me down.


1577
01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:42.260
這是為了你的安全著想
It's for your own safety.


1578
01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:47.130
你對傑克·文生警官知道些什麼呢?
What can you tell us about Jack Vincennes?


1579
01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:49.500
好萊塢傑克  那個大騷包
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?


1580
01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.260
他已經踏上奈何橋了
I can tell you he's on the night train to the Big Adios.


1581
01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:58.540
我跟他的死沒有任何關係
I had nothing to do with him getting killed,


1582
01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.510
你是不是要問這個?
if that's what you mean.


1583
01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:02.880
可是你們不是合夥人嗎?
-But you were business associates.


1584
01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:04.710
這跟他的死有什麼關係
-What's that got to do with anything?


1585
01:43:06.090 --> 01:43:08.050
好  我們是一起合作
Okay, so we worked together.


1586
01:43:09.090 --> 01:43:11.020
不過是互相交換消息嘛
It was an information exchange.


1587
01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:12.490
我幫他找出一些要犯
I got him first-class collars,


1588
01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:13.590
而他提供我一些好的題材
he got me good stories.


1589
01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:15.630
我們只是朋友而已
We were friends.


1590
01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:17.890
好了  暫時先別談傑克了
We'll drop that for the moment.


1591
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.990
可以談談皮爾斯·巴卻嗎?
Care to comment on Pierce Patchett?


1592
01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.500
巴卻? 你想他跟文生的死有關嗎?
You think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced?


1593
01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:28.960
我希望我問話的時候  對方能夠完全跟我合作
Wendell, I'd like full and docile cooperation on every topic.


1594
01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:31.080
好啦好啦
Okay, okay, okay. All right.


1595
01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:35.980
每個人都知道巴卻他腰纏萬貫
Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boatload of greenbacks.


1596
01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:38.080
不過那個人也有一些嗜好的
But the man has hobbies too.


1597
01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:41.280
他私底下會出資拍一些黃色電影
He bankrolls B movies under the table.


1598
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:43.050
你再聽聽這個
And try this one on.


1599
01:43:43.190 --> 01:43:45.450
另外聽說他還會吸毒
He's rumored to be a heroin snuffer.


1600
01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:48.750
總之一句話  他是一個深入簡出的怪富豪
All in all, a powerful behind-the-scenes strange-o.


1601
01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:50.920
還有呢?  還有什麼?
And? And what?


1602
01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:58.670
人跟人相處是互相的
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is the key to every relationship.


1603
01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:03.910
他還開了應召站
He runs call girls.


1604
01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:07.900
整容整得像電影明星的妓女
Primo tail fixed up to look like movie stars.


1605
01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:12.440
還有呢?
And?


1606
01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.020
還有他也搞勒索那一套
Blackmail shit.


1607
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.450
我車上  行李箱地毯下面
In my car, in the trunk, under the rug.


1608
01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:19.960
巴卻給了我一些警察
Patchett got me to photograph...


1609
01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:22.460
跟一個叫琳恩的女人上床的照片
this cop screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.


1610
01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.530
那女的長得像薇洛妮卡
She looks like Veronica Lake.


1611
01:44:26.130 --> 01:44:27.260
放開他
Leave him!


1612
01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.060
我叫你放開他
I said leave him be!


1613
01:44:29.170 --> 01:44:30.600
快點把他拉走
Get him away from me!


1614
01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:32.800
退後
Back off! Back off!


1615
01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:19.440
就算全愛爾蘭的威士忌都給我
I wouldn't trade places with Exley right now


1616
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:21.380
我都不願意跟艾斯利交換位置
for all the whiskey in Ireland.


1617
01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:24.050
杜德利
Dudley


1618
01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:28.760
杜德利  我還以為你會讓那個笨蛋把我給宰了呢
Dudley, I thought you were going to let the dumb bastard kill me!


1619
01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.450
還有你
And you.


1620
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.830
下次別真的揍下去行嗎?
Learn to pull your punches a little better.


1621
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:34.300
現在可以把我給放了吧
You can uncaught me now, fellas.


1622
01:45:40.770 --> 01:45:42.170
喂  各位
Fellas


1623
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:44.840
杜德利  我們說好的
we had a deal.


1624
01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.710
你  我跟巴卻  我們是一夥的
You, me, Patchett, we're a team.


1625
01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:52.780
噓噓
Hush-hush.


1626
01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:56.350
有沒有?  沒有
-Anything? -Nothing.


1627
01:45:56.490 --> 01:45:59.120
難道米克斯在掃毒組沒抓過人
Meeks never made an arrest the entire time he worked Vice?


1628
01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:00.990
一定是有人把檔案拿走了
Someone must've pulled the files.


1629
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:05.660
那日常勤務報告呢?
What about the daily report books?


1630
01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.060
如果還在一定是放在地下室
They'd be buried in the basement.


1631
01:46:08.170 --> 01:46:09.330
去找出來
Find them.


1632
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:41.450
你跟艾斯利談過話?
Did you talk to Exley?


1633
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:43.660
先進來避雨
Come in out of the rain.


1634
01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:47.590
你跟艾斯利是怎麼回事?
I want to know what happened with Exley.


1635
01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.100
你進來
Just come in.


1636
01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.710
你到底要不要告訴我  你跟艾斯利是怎麼回事?
Are you going to tell me what happened with Exley?


1637
01:46:55.810 --> 01:46:57.650
我們說過話
We talked.


1638
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:59.270
把他的事告訴我
Tell me about him.


1639
01:46:59.450 --> 01:47:02.510
- 待會兒  - 不  現在
- Later. - No!Now!


1640
01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.880
你跟他搞過
You fucked him.


1641
01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:12.060
你跟他搞過
You fucked him.


1642
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:14.790
我以為我是在幫你
I thought I was helping you.


1643
01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.460
米克斯與史丹斯蘭謹呈

1644
01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.870
杜德利·史密斯長官鈞啟
茲此呈上本報告


1645
01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.380
你來的正好
I'm glad you're here.


1646
01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:08.850
快過來看看這個
I need you to see this.


1647
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:18.850
等一下
Wait.


1648
01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:47.720
杜德利殺了傑克
Dudley killed Jack.


1649
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:49.190
他希望你把我殺了
He wants you to kill me.


1650
01:48:52.930 --> 01:48:55.420
是他把照片給你看的對不對
He showed you the photo, didn't he?


1651
01:48:55.570 --> 01:48:56.730
對不對?
Didn't he?


1652
01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.670
你想一想  該死  想一想
Think!! Goddamn you, think!!


1653
01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:04.970
統統滾開
Get out!


1654
01:49:18.690 --> 01:49:19.660
杜德利
Dudley


1655
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:23.320
我查過日常勤務報告
I checked the daily report books.


1656
01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:28.160
杜德利  巴茲·米克斯以及史丹斯蘭  早就同流合污了
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and Stensland go way back.


1657
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:33.540
我早知道史丹斯蘭在騙我
I knew Stensland lied to me.


1658
01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:39.640
雷佛的母親認出了史丹斯蘭  就是雷佛的男友
Lefferts' mother I.D.'d Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend.


1659
01:49:41.710 --> 01:49:44.200
我碰見琳恩那晚史丹斯蘭
Stensland pretended he didn't know Meeks...


1660
01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:47.620
他還裝作不認識米克斯
or her the night that I met Lynn.


1661
01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.620
史丹斯蘭跟米克斯
Stensland and Meeks


1662
01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.820
他們到底在搞什麼把戲?
what the hell were they up to?


1663
01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:55.120
我不知道
I don't know.


1664
01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:58.020
不過我想史丹斯蘭  為了海洛因殺了米克斯
But I think Stens killed Meeks over heroin.


1665
01:49:58.130 --> 01:49:59.360
什麼海洛因?
What heroin?


1666
01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:08.430
強寧·史當巴那多告訴我米克斯手上有海洛因要賣
Johnny Stompanato told me that Meeks had heroin for sale.


1667
01:50:09.110 --> 01:50:11.100
結果米克斯死了
Meeks ends up dead.


1668
01:50:11.210 --> 01:50:13.200
而史丹斯蘭也死在夜貓子
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.


1669
01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.910
兇手不是那些黑人
It wasn't the Negroes.


1670
01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.580
被強暴的被害人說謊
The rape victim lied in her statement.


1671
01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.310
最先趕到福特跑車那兒的是  布魯尼跟卡爾萊
The first guys to the Mercury coupe were Breuning and Carlisle.


1672
01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:25.320
是杜德利的人
Dudley's guys.


1673
01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:27.120
散彈鎗是他們栽的贓
They planted the shotguns.


1674
01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:28.350
如果我跟傑克沒有出現
They'd have killed the Negroes too


1675
01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:30.020
它們當場就會把那些黑人殺了
if Jack and I hadn't shown up.


1676
01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:35.150
杜德利會栽他們贓  是因為他們是黑人又有前科
Dudley framed them because they were Negroes and had records.


1677
01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:37.430
他知道如果他們因為拒捕被殺
He knew there'd be no questions asked


1678
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:42.540
就不會有任何人起疑
if they were killed resisting arrest.


1679
01:50:42.670 --> 01:50:45.510
而此事又跟傑克所調查的事有關
Somehow this is all connected to Jack's angle.


1680
01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:47.470
西·德哈金斯
Sid Hudgens


1681
01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:50.240
勒索羅的照片
the pictures to blackmail Ellis Loew.


1682
01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:53.110
被殺的那個年輕人
A kid got murdered.


1683
01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:55.550
如果想弄清此事我們就得合作
To figure this out, we need to work together.


1684
01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:02.690
你為什麼這麼做?
Why are you doing this?


1685
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.330
夜貓子使你功名成就
The Nite Owl made you.


1686
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:10.000
你希望這一切成為泡影?
You want to tear all that down?


1687
01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:14.070
而且煙消雲散
With a wrecking ball.


1688
01:51:14.170 --> 01:51:15.540
要不要幫我大幹一場?
Want to help me swing it?


1689
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:29.720
去找艾力斯羅吧
Let's go see Ellis Loew.


1690
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:33.020
看看檢察官知道些什麼
Find out what the District Attorney knows.


1691
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:43.260
喂  你們不能進去
You can't go in there.


1692
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:47.130
要不要我報警  羅先生?
-Want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?


1693
01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.730
你就找杜德利·史密斯組長
-Ask for Capt. Dudley Smith.


1694
01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:50.670
告訴他我們在討論
Tell him we're discussing...


1695
01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:52.680
演員陳屍日落大道旅館的事
an unemployed actor's death at a Sunset Strip motel.


1696
01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:54.440
他們就是警察
These are the police.


1697
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:01.580
你們有什麼事?
What do you want?


1698
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:03.690
我要檢察處派人二十四小時
I want D.A. bureau men to


1699
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:06.550
監視杜德利·史密斯跟皮爾斯
tail Dudley Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.


1700
01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:09.990
我要你讓法官准許監聽他們的電話
I want you to get a judge to authorize wiretaps on their home phones.


1701
01:52:10.130 --> 01:52:13.000
還有查他們銀行記錄的許可令
I want authorization to check their bank records.


1702
01:52:13.130 --> 01:52:15.030
憑什麼證據?
On what evidence?


1703
01:52:15.130 --> 01:52:16.530
就憑我的直覺
Call it a hunch.


1704
01:52:17.970 --> 01:52:19.700
絕對不行
Absolutely not.


1705
01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.800
杜德利是警局功勳卓著的人
Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of the department.


1706
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:24.970
我不會毀了他跟皮爾斯的名譽
I won't smear his and Patchett's name without--


1707
01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:26.870
除非  除非怎樣?
Without what?


1708
01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:29.110
他們先毀了你的名譽?
Them smearing yours first?


1709
01:52:29.210 --> 01:52:30.610
你有什麼把柄在他們手上?
What do they have?


1710
01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:33.050
你跟雷諾一絲不掛的照片?
Pictures of you and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?


1711
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:36.790
你有證據嗎?
You have any proof?


1712
01:52:36.890 --> 01:52:38.880
證人已經被宰了
The proof had his throat slit.


1713
01:52:40.130 --> 01:52:41.820
到目前為止  你並未否認
So far, you're not denying it.


1714
01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.620
我不屑於做任何回答
I won't dignify this with answers.


1715
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.290
如果二位不介意的話
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me


1716
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:51.600
我還得去向記者說明傑克·文生遇害的事
I have a press conference for Jack Vincennes that I have to prepare for.


1717
01:53:02.650 --> 01:53:04.810
除非你們是要來替我擦屁股的
Unless you came to wipe my ass,


1718
01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.510
否則我們之間好像沒什麼事了
I believe we're through.


1719
01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:13.750
好了  少來白臉黑臉那一套了
Don't pull that good cop-bad cop crap.


1720
01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:15.050
我還是開山始祖呢
I practically invented it.


1721
01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:18.660
死了個同性戀男演員又怎樣
So what if some homo actor is dead.


1722
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:21.430
男男女女  這種人滿街都是
Boys, girls, ten of them get off the bus to L.A. everyday.


1723
01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.240
叫他放開我  艾斯利
Pull him off me!!


1724
01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.780
我不知道怎麼跟他說
I don't know how.


1725
01:53:36.210 --> 01:53:38.480
我知道你自以為是頭號大人物
I know you think you're the A-number-one hotshot,


1726
01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:39.450
不過老實說
but here's the juice.


1727
01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:40.410
如果我把你殺了
If I kill you,


1728
01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:42.580
明天馬上會有十個律師來接你的位子

1729
01:53:42.690 --> 01:53:44.180
只是他們可不是滿街都是
They just won't come on a bus.


1730
01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:00.100
好啦
Okay!


1731
01:54:01.410 --> 01:54:02.460
杜德利跟巴卻他們
Dudley and Patchett, they.


1732
01:54:04.210 --> 01:54:05.570
哦  我的天
Oh, my God!


1733
01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:06.800
因為我不肯同流合污
I wouldn't play ball


1734
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:09.310
所以他們設計陷害我  我只好屈服
so they set me up! I gave in!


1735
01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:11.440
那個年輕人正好聽見了經過
But the kid heard everything


1736
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:12.570
所以他們把他給殺了
so they killed him.


1737
01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:15.440
為什麼?杜德利跟皮爾斯有什麼陰謀?
Why? -What are Dudley and Patchett up to?


1738
01:54:15.450 --> 01:54:17.580
他們要接手柯漢的盤口
-Taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.


1739
01:54:17.690 --> 01:54:21.120
因為有了那些照片  我無法起訴他們
Because of those pictures I couldn't prosecute them!


1740
01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:22.860
哦  天啊
Oh, Jesus!


1741
01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:24.690
拉我起來
Help me up!


1742
01:54:33.710 --> 01:54:35.760
你以前是這麼玩黑臉白臉的嗎
Is that how you ran the good cop-bad cop?


1743
01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:39.430
巴卻?
Patchett?


1744
01:55:15.010 --> 01:55:17.380
看來他的保鏢喜新厭舊了
Looks like his bodyguard had a conflict of interest.


1745
01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.450
自殺遺書上頭說
Suicide note.


1746
01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:29.520
傑克發現了他開應召站  所以他殺了傑克
Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out his pornography scam.


1747
01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.450
他不是自殺的
Slicing himself open wasn't his idea.


1748
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:35.500
他有兩根手指頭裂開了

1749
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:36.790
兇手硬把他拖過來的
They held him there.


1750
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:40.000
或是用藥把他迷昏了
Or drugged him.


1751
01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:45.700
杜德利想亡羊補牢
Dudley's tying up his loose ends.


1752
01:55:45.810 --> 01:55:46.970
巴卻死了
Patchett's dead.


1753
01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:48.770
他又派你來殺我
He sent you after me.


1754
01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:51.740
琳恩?
Lynn.


1755
01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:53.970
通知西好萊塢警長
West Hollywood Sheriff.


1756
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:54.980
他們那兒比我們近
-They're closer than we are.


1757
01:55:55.090 --> 01:55:55.980
我去開車
-I'll get the car.


1758
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:57.280
鑰匙
Keys!


1759
01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:07.460
我們把她送到局裏保護了
We took her to the station for safekeeping.


1760
01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:10.160
把她當瓊史密斯
Hold her as Joan Smith.


1761
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:12.630
除非我允許否則不許任何人見她
And no one sees her unless I okay it.


1762
01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:14.530
有人打過她
Someone worked her over.


1763
01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.270
她不肯說是誰
She wouldn't say who.


1764
01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:23.100
再見  艾斯利  再見
See you, Exley.


1765
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:27.510
我們應該去跟琳恩談談
We should talk to Lynn.


1766
01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.480
你去
You do it.


1767
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:32.150
那你呢?
What will you do?


1768
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:37.520
我去找西·德哈金斯
I'm going to talk to Sid Hudgens.


1769
01:56:37.630 --> 01:56:40.460
好好誇獎一下他在勝利旅館的演技
Compliment him on his performance at the Victory Motel.


1770
01:56:40.570 --> 01:56:43.800
記住  巴德  我們需要證據
Remember, Bud, we need evidence.


1771
01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:45.200
我會拿到證據的
I'll get the evidence.


1772
01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.210
你還好吧?
Are you okay?


1773
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:03.120
你還好吧?
You okay?


1774
01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:15.230
巴德很後悔打了你
Bud hates himself for what he did.


1775
01:57:16.630 --> 01:57:18.430
我知道他心裏的感受
I know how he feels.


1776
01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.840
我必須知道你有什麼  不利於杜德斯史密斯的證據
I need to know what you can give me on Dudley Smith.


1777
01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:28.880
他是跟巴卻同流合污的警官
He's a police captain in business with Patchett.


1778
01:57:29.050 --> 01:57:30.410
我沒聽過這個人
I've never heard of him.


1779
01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:36.550
你有沒有地方可以去?
Do you have a place to stay?


1780
01:57:38.190 --> 01:57:39.420
我不會有事的
I'll be okay.


1781
01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.020
沒有證件的人不可以進去
Nobody goes in without official I.D.!


1782
01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:55.070
他沒關係  讓他進來
He's okay. Let him through.


1783
01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.370
發生了什麼事?
What happened?


1784
01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:03.540
有人把他活活打死然後偷走了一大堆檔案
Someone beat him to death, and stole a bunch of files.


1785
01:58:03.650 --> 01:58:05.980
一定是他去揭人家的瘡疤
Must have dug up garbage on the wrong guy.


1786
01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:09.140
所以範圍縮小到一千人左右
We got it narrowed down to 1000 suspects.


1787
01:58:09.250 --> 01:58:10.380
懷特警員
Sergeant White


1788
01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:13.060
勤務中心接到你的電話
dispatch got a call for you.


1789
01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.990
艾斯利警官要你到勝利旅館去找他
Lieutenant Exley wants you to meet him at the Victory Motel.


1790
01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:51.650
你要我到這兒找你?
You wanted to meet here?


1791
01:58:54.170 --> 01:58:56.730
- 是你說的 我以為哈金斯… - 他已經死了
- You called it. I thought Hudgens was… - Hudgens is dead.


1792
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:09.800
我們快走
Let's get out of here.


1793
01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:18.710
來不及了
It's too late.


1794
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:10.670
你懷疑是圈套還來?
You figured it was a set-up but came anyway?


1795
02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:13.270
這兒發生了太多壞事了
A lot of bad stuff happened here.


1796
02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:15.110
所有恩怨正好在這兒做個了結
It's as good a place as any for it to end.


1797
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.050
彈夾
Clip.


1798
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:34.460
我只是想追上先父而已
All I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.


1799
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:37.200
你的機會來了
Now's your chance.


1800
02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.440
他是因公殉職的對不對?
He died in the line of duty, didn't he?


1801
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:42.270
巴德
Bud.


1802
02:02:41.090 --> 02:02:42.250
該死
Goddamn it!


1803
02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:43.950
你沒事吧?
You okay?


1804
02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:45.150
沒事
Yeah.


1805
02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.870
起來
Come on. Easy.


1806
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:13.520
走
Move!


1807
02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:37.600
羅羅·湯馬西
Rollo Tomasi.


1808
02:04:41.110 --> 02:04:43.050
他是誰?
Who is he?


1809
02:04:43.150 --> 02:04:44.380
就是你
You are.


1810
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:48.450
你就是那個逍遙法外的人
You're the guy who gets away with it.


1811
02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:53.680
傑克他知道了
Jack knew it.


1812
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:55.050
我也知道了
And so do l.


1813
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:22.480
你是打算殺了我
Are you going to shoot me


1814
02:05:23.890 --> 02:05:25.290
還是要逮捕我?
or arrest me?


1815
02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:32.280
好孩子
Good lad.


1816
02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:34.900
永遠是那麼聰明
Always the politician.


1817
02:05:36.130 --> 02:05:38.260
由我來出面說明
Let me do the talking.


1818
02:05:38.370 --> 02:05:39.600
等我說明完了  此後
After I'm done,


1819
02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:41.640
你馬上可以升為刑事組長
they'll make you Chief of Detectives.


1820
02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:11.230
把警徽舉高一點
Hold up your badge


1821
02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:13.030
他們才會知道你是警察
so they'll know you're a policeman.


1822
02:07:04.090 --> 02:07:06.180
你以為這麼輕易就可以脫罪
You think you can talk your way out of this, Lieutenant?


1823
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:12.420
不  不過我可以說出真相
No but I can tell the truth.


1824
02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:19.490
在調查與夜貓子案相關的事件時
During our investigation of events surrounding the Nite Owl case


1825
02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:24.640
傑克·文生  巴德·懷特跟我本人發現了下列事惰
Jack Vincennes, Bud White and I learned the following:


1826
02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:27.230
你的金童正在自毀前程
Your golden boy's throwing his whole life away.


1827
02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:29.710
夜貓子案之三名嫌犯
The 3 Nite Owl suspects


1828
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:32.940
確實犯了強姦綁架罪
while guilty of kidnapping and rape


1829
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:35.710
卻並未在夜貓子犯下殺人案
were innocent of the multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.


1830
02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:39.410
夜貓子的真正兇手極有可能是
The gunmen were most likely


1831
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:44.430
洛杉磯警察麥可布魯因以及威廉卡爾萊
Los Angeles police officers Michael Breuning and William Carlisle


1832
02:07:44.530 --> 02:07:46.690
至於第三個人
and a third man


1833
02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:50.160
可能是  也可能不是史密斯組長
who may or may not have been Captain Dudley Smith.


1834
02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:52.800
他們殺人之目的乃是
The objective:


1835
02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:56.530
為了幹掉另一名警員
The elimination of another police officer


1836
02:07:56.670 --> 02:07:58.230
狄克·史丹斯
Richard Stensland


1837
02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:04.740
該員跟一名洛杉磯離職警員李蘭巴茲·米克斯
who, along with former LAPD officer Leland "Buzz" Meeks


1838
02:08:05.550 --> 02:08:08.810
曾經為史密斯組長犯下數起殺人案
also committed multiple homicides on behalf of Captain Smith


1839
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:14.980
後來又為了二十五磅海洛因  而出賣了史密斯組長
and then betrayed him over 25 pounds of heroin


1840
02:08:15.090 --> 02:08:17.190
而夜貓子案幕後真正的動機
the retrieval of which


1841
02:08:17.290 --> 02:08:19.790
正是為了取回那些海洛因
was the ultimate motivation behind the Nite Owl killings.


1842
02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:27.060
自米奇·柯漢入獄開始
Beginning with the incarceration of Mickey Cohen


1843
02:08:27.170 --> 02:08:32.770
史密斯組長便圖謀接管洛杉磯的黑社會
Capt. Smith has been assuming control of organized crime in Los Angeles.


1844
02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:38.280
其手段包括了暗殺柯漢的手下
This includes the assassinations of Mickey Cohen lieutenants


1845
02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:43.050
循序恐嚇政府官員
the systematic blackmail of city officials


1846
02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:45.140
以及殺害蘇珊雷佛
and the murders of Susan Lefferts,


1847
02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:47.220
皮爾斯·巴卻  西·德哈金斯
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens


1848
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:50.860
以及傑克·文生警官
and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.


1849
02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:57.700
史密斯組長在勝利汽車旅館
Captain Smith admitted as much to me


1850
02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:02.000
被我射殺之前向我坦承了一切
before I shot him at the Victory Motel.


1851
02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:05.330
說完了
That's it.


1852
02:09:07.650 --> 02:09:12.340
好了  媒體這下可樂翻天了
Well the press will have a field day.


1853
02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:17.920
這將使本局未來幾年抬不起頭
Christ! It'll stain the Department for years.


1854
02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:19.180
未來幾十年
Decades.


1855
02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:22.750
如果我們能讓孩子上道一點
If we can get the kid to play ball


1856
02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:25.350
那還有誰會說出去呢
who's to say what happened?


1857
02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:29.460
或許史密斯是像英雄般殉職的
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.


1858
02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:32.360
好主意  如果媒體肯跟我們合作
-Good idea. -lf we get the press to play.


1859
02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:42.380
要不要告訴我你在笑什麼
Want to tell me what you're smiling about?


1860
02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:49.180
英雄
A hero.


1861
02:09:50.050 --> 02:09:51.780
他怎麼知道我們在說什麼
How'd he know what we said?


1862
02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:53.320
他不可能聽見的
