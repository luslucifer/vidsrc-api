49
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:33.338
It's just me you want to treat like a...
A war criminal.


50
00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:38.588
[Naomi] <i>Umma</i> was out working.

Why are you making it such a big deal?

I wouldn't tell you to do things or yell
at you if you actually listened to me!

I'm trying to do something nice
for <i>Appa's</i> birthday.


60
00:04:12.255 --> 00:04:14.671
And you won't even help.

I don't want you out of the house
all the time after I'm gone.


85

since <i>Umma</i> started her new hours,


86
00:06:32.463 --> 00:06:34.755
and I know she's not at home
all that much anymore,


87

but she misses you.

88

Did she tell you to say that?

89
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:43.671
You would know
if you spent five minutes with her.


90

Can't you do at least that?
Just for the both of them?


91
00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:48.463
Maybe it's like you said, <i>Unnie</i>.

00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:18.578
- Can you hear me?
- [Naomi] Remember when we were younger,


162
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.439
and you said you'd
open up a restaurant for us?


163
00:12:20.463 --> 00:12:21.671
Give them back!

164
00:12:21.755 --> 00:12:23.338
- [Naomi laughs]
- Restaurant?


165
00:12:23.421 --> 00:12:25.963
This man can't even open a pickle jar!

166
00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.838
[family laughing]

167
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:32.546
[mom] Elena.
You haven't touched your cake, my love.


168
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.255
Are you all right?

169
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.380
Everything's perfect, <i>Mamá</i>.

170
00:12:43.046 --> 00:12:44.046
And…

171
00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:49.796
this is my friend Clarice.

172
00:12:51.255 --> 00:12:52.713
[family] Hi, Clarice!

173
00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:55.838
[dad] A friend of Elena's
is always welcome here.


174
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:58.189
- How long do you plan to stay with us?
- [Naomi] Get comfy!


175
00:12:58.213 --> 00:12:59.671
Have a cupcake.

176
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.630
Here, we will never, ever fight.

177
00:13:08.713 --> 00:13:10.130
Every morning, we will wake up

178
00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.546
and love each other more
than anything in the world.


179
00:13:13.046 --> 00:13:14.046
Isn't this better?

180
00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:20.005
Clarice, I'm so happy you're here.

181
00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:41.838
[sighs] But this isn't my family.

182
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.546
And it isn't yours.

183
00:13:47.296 --> 00:13:49.255
[breathes deeply]

184
00:13:51.213 --> 00:13:52.213
[Clarice] Wait!

185
00:13:55.713 --> 00:13:57.338
This is the worst birthday ever!

186
00:13:57.421 --> 00:13:59.088
I'm so sorry, love.

187
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.011
- When you come home...
- I don't wanna come back!


188
00:14:01.046 --> 00:14:04.088
- I hope I never see you again!
- [smacks lip] Aw. Oh.


189
00:14:04.171 --> 00:14:06.213
- [gasps, whimpers]
- Elena!


190
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:13.505
[footsteps departing]

191
00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:15.588
[siren wailing in distance]

192
00:14:34.588 --> 00:14:36.255
I never got to say "sorry."

193
00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:42.088
- [sniffles]
- You, um, never saw them again?


194
00:14:47.046 --> 00:14:48.796
<i>Mamá</i> and <i>Papá</i> must have hated me.

195
00:14:57.255 --> 00:14:58.255
No, Elena.

196
00:14:58.338 --> 00:15:01.963
Your parents loved you,
even if you pushed them away.


197
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.880
But I yelled at them.

198
00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:08.046
Yeah, and they loved you.

199
00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:18.213
[wind whistling]

200
00:15:27.671 --> 00:15:28.671
<i>Unnie.</i>

201
00:15:30.421 --> 00:15:31.880
Clarice?

202
00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:33.296
Did we get her?

203
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.796
[breathes sharply]

204
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.755
[dad, in Korean]

205
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:47.296
[chuckles]

206
00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:49.046
[mom speaking Korean]

207
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.005
[Naomi] <i>Umma? Appa?</i>

208
00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.630
[dad laughs]

209
00:16:07.588 --> 00:16:09.421
- [lawn mower whirring]
- [birds twittering]


210
00:16:14.713 --> 00:16:17.380
[in English] <i>Appa</i>… this is from me.

211
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.713
And <i>Umma</i>.

212
00:16:26.838 --> 00:16:28.213
[in Korean]

213
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.255
[exhales deeply]

214
00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:38.296
[in English] Wow.

215
00:16:39.463 --> 00:16:41.796
It's been a long time. [chuckles]

216
00:16:42.588 --> 00:16:44.505
- [ball thuds]
- Oh! [chuckling]

[chuckles]

219
00:16:52.171 --> 00:16:53.963
[in English] Your dad is so happy.

220
00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.046
[chuckles]

221
00:16:58.213 --> 00:16:59.421
<i>Umma.</i>

222
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.838
Does it make you feel sad
that I can't understand you more?


223
00:17:07.838 --> 00:17:08.838
Um…

224
00:17:11.755 --> 00:17:12.755
Yes.

225
00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:19.505
It's hard for me to tell you things.

226
00:17:20.755 --> 00:17:22.380
A lot of things.

227
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.046
I wanna know.

228
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:32.255
As much as I can.

229
00:17:36.671 --> 00:17:37.671
[exhales]

230
00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:41.838
That is good start.

[laughs]

232
00:17:52.338 --> 00:17:53.421
[dad speaking Korean]

233
00:17:54.463 --> 00:17:55.963
[in English] Okay! <i>Umma</i>!

234
00:17:56.046 --> 00:17:57.421
Oh, <i>Umma</i>!

235
00:17:57.505 --> 00:17:59.171
Next time, we're playing hockey.

236
00:17:59.838 --> 00:18:01.963
- Baby steps, Clarice. Baby steps.
- [dad grunting]
