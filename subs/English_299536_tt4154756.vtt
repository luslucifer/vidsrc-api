1
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.315
Asgardian: (On radio)
This is the asgardian


2
00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:30.859
refugee vessel statesman.

3
00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:33.529
(People whimpering
and screaming)


4
00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:34.905
We are under assault.

5
00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:37.074
I repeat,
we are under assault.


6
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:40.786
The engines are dead,
life support failing.


7
00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:43.914
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.


8
00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:47.084
We are 22 jump points
out of asgard.


9
00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:50.712
Our crew is made up
of asgardian families.


10
00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:52.297
We have
very few soldiers here.


11
00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:54.341
This is not a warcraft.

12
00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:56.426
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.


13
00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:12.901
Ebony maw:
Hear me and rejoice.


14
00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:16.321
(Groans)

15
00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:18.949
You have had the privilege

16
00:01:19.032 --> 00:01:21.702
of being saved
by the great titan.


17
00:01:24.663 --> 00:01:26.874
You may think
this is suffering.


18
00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:29.084
No.

19
00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.462
It is salvation.

20
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:40.053
Universal scales
tip toward balance


21
00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:41.889
because of your sacrifice.

22
00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:44.933
Smile.

23
00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:46.101
-(Blade swishes)
-(Man grunts)


24
00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:48.270
For even in death,

25
00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:50.814
you have become
children of thanos.


26
00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:08.290
I Know what it's like to lose.

27
00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.420
To feel So desperately
that you're right...


28
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:16.924
Yet to fail, nonetheless.

29
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.805
(Thor groaning)

30
00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:26.642
It's frightening.

31
00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:29.937
Turns the legs to jelly.

32
00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.191
But I ask you, to what end?

33
00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.195
Dread it, run from it...

34
00:02:39.237 --> 00:02:41.782
Destiny arrives all the same.

35
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:44.826
And now, it's here.

36
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.245
Or should I say...

37
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.123
I am.

38
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:55.420
(Choking)

39
00:02:55.504 --> 00:02:56.880
You talk too much.

40
00:02:58.173 --> 00:02:59.591
The tesseract.

41
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.135
Or your brother's head.

42
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.682
(Low growl)

43
00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:09.184
I assume you have
a preference.


44
00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:11.728
Oh, I do.

45
00:03:11.812 --> 00:03:13.480
(Thor continues choking)

46
00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:15.148
Kill away.

47
00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:18.110
-(Crackling)
-(Groaning)


48
00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.364
(Thor screaming)

49
00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:31.540
All right, stop!

50
00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:35.043
(Thor gasping)

51
00:03:35.127 --> 00:03:37.087
We don't have the tesseract.

52
00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:39.047
It was destroyed on asgard.

53
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:52.728
(Panting) You really are
the worst brother.


54
00:03:57.816 --> 00:03:59.693
I assure you, brother...

55
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.862
The sun will shine
on us again.


56
00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:03.238
(Thanos chuckling)

57
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.742
Your optimism is misplaced,
asgardian.


58
00:04:07.117 --> 00:04:10.871
Well, for one thing,
I'm not asgardian.


59
00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:12.247
And for another...

60
00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:15.917
We have a hulk.

61
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:17.502
(Hulk roars)

62
00:04:19.254 --> 00:04:20.630
(Roars)

63
00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:23.425
(Thanos grunting)

64
00:04:27.262 --> 00:04:29.973
-(Thanos groans)
-Let him have his fun.


65
00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:34.061
(Grunting)

66
00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:40.275
(Groans)

67
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.448
(Hulk grunting)

68
00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:55.082
(Grunting)

69
00:05:05.717 --> 00:05:06.927
(Clattering)

70
00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:08.720
(Grunts)

71
00:05:17.854 --> 00:05:19.689
(Panting)

72
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:23.735
Allfathers...

73
00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:25.529
(Panting)

74
00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:28.865
Iet the dark magic flow
through me one last...


75
00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:30.784
Time.

76
00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.461
(Panting)

77
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.092
That was a mistake.

78
00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:52.889
(Groans)

79
00:05:52.973 --> 00:05:54.641
No!

80
00:06:03.775 --> 00:06:06.403
You're going to die for that.

81
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:10.740
Shh.

82
00:06:17.664 --> 00:06:19.416
My humble personage...

83
00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:23.128
Bows before your grandeur.

84
00:06:26.423 --> 00:06:29.634
No other being
has ever had the might...


85
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.720
Nay, the nobility...

86
00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:36.808
To wield not one,
but two infinity stones.


87
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.691
The universe lies
within your grasp.


88
00:07:08.632 --> 00:07:11.009
(Thanos groaning)

89
00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:26.691
There are two more stones
on earth.


90
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:31.655
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on titan.


91
00:07:31.947 --> 00:07:33.365
Father, we will not fail you.

92
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:35.033
Loki: If I might interject.

93
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:39.496
If you're going to earth,
you might want a guide.


94
00:07:40.413 --> 00:07:43.083
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.


95
00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:45.418
If you consider
failure experience.


96
00:07:45.585 --> 00:07:48.338
I consider
experience experience.


97
00:07:49.547 --> 00:07:51.049
Almighty thanos...

98
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:56.012
I, loki, prince of asgard...

99
00:07:59.808 --> 00:08:01.017
Odinson...

100
00:08:04.938 --> 00:08:06.856
The rightful king
of Jotunheim...


101
00:08:07.482 --> 00:08:09.359
God of mischief...

102
00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:11.736
Do hereby pledge to you...

103
00:08:13.154 --> 00:08:17.033
My undying fidelity.

104
00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:29.087
Undying?

105
00:08:32.882 --> 00:08:35.510
You should choose your words
more carefully.


106
00:08:36.094 --> 00:08:37.429
-(Loki grunts)
-(Blade clatters)


107
00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:40.473
(Choking)

108
00:08:51.234 --> 00:08:52.902
(Breathing heavily)

109
00:08:57.073 --> 00:08:58.074
(Straining) You...

110
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.785
Will never be...

111
00:09:03.496 --> 00:09:04.622
A god.

112
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.128
(Bones crack)

113
00:09:14.924 --> 00:09:15.925
(Muffled) No!

114
00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:33.401
No resurrections this time.

115
00:09:57.008 --> 00:09:59.177
No. Loki.

116
00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:40.885
Dr strange: Seriously,
you don't have any money?


117
00:10:41.052 --> 00:10:44.097
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.


118
00:10:44.264 --> 00:10:45.557
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.


119
00:10:45.723 --> 00:10:47.600
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.


120
00:10:47.767 --> 00:10:49.602
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.


121
00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:50.770
Dollars?

122
00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:52.272
-Rupees.
-Which is?


123
00:10:52.856 --> 00:10:54.274
-Uh, buck and a half.
-(Sighs)


124
00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:55.650
What do you want?

125
00:10:56.276 --> 00:10:58.445
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.


126
00:11:06.327 --> 00:11:08.329
(Banner groaning)

127
00:11:10.915 --> 00:11:12.876
Thanos is coming.

128
00:11:13.418 --> 00:11:14.669
He's coming.

129
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.133
Who?

130
00:11:29.142 --> 00:11:30.226
Stark: Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.


131
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.311
Pepper:
You're totally rambling.


132
00:11:31.394 --> 00:11:32.437
Stark: No, I'm not.
Pepper: You lost me.


133
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.646
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,


134
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:34.856
and in the dream
you gotta pee.


135
00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:36.024
-Yeah.
-Okay.


136
00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:37.317
And then you're like,
"oh, my god.


137
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.568
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?


138
00:11:38.651 --> 00:11:39.652
-"Oh, someone's watching."
-Right.


139
00:11:39.736 --> 00:11:40.737
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."


140
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.905
And then you wake up
and in real life


141
00:11:41.988 --> 00:11:43.031
you actually have to pee.

142
00:11:43.114 --> 00:11:44.115
-Yes.
-Yeah.


143
00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:45.325
-Okay.
-Everybody has that.


144
00:11:45.492 --> 00:11:47.202
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.


145
00:11:47.535 --> 00:11:51.539
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.


146
00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:53.333
It was So real.

147
00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:55.043
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.


148
00:11:55.126 --> 00:11:56.127
Uh, what was his name?

149
00:11:56.294 --> 00:11:58.546
-Right.
-Morgan! Morgan.


150
00:11:58.713 --> 00:12:00.340
-So you woke up...
-Naturally.


151
00:12:00.507 --> 00:12:02.091
...and thought that we were...

152
00:12:02.258 --> 00:12:03.259
-Expecting.
-Yeah.


153
00:12:03.343 --> 00:12:04.344
-Yes?
-No.


154
00:12:04.552 --> 00:12:05.929
I had a dream about it.
It was So real.


155
00:12:06.095 --> 00:12:07.430
If you wanted to have a kid...

156
00:12:08.097 --> 00:12:09.516
You wouldn't have done that.

157
00:12:10.183 --> 00:12:12.060
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.


158
00:12:12.227 --> 00:12:13.645
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.


159
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:15.230
You're not helping
your case, okay?


160
00:12:15.313 --> 00:12:16.439
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...


161
00:12:16.606 --> 00:12:18.066
You don't need that.

162
00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.484
I Know, I had the surgery.

163
00:12:19.567 --> 00:12:20.652
I'm just
trying to protect us...


164
00:12:20.818 --> 00:12:22.445
And future usses
and that's it.


165
00:12:22.612 --> 00:12:24.113
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.


166
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.199
-Instead of, you know...
-Shirts.


167
00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:29.327
You know me So Well.

168
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.121
-(Sighs) God.
-You finish all my sentences.


169
00:12:32.664 --> 00:12:34.541
You should have shirts
in your closet.


170
00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:35.917
Yeah.

171
00:12:36.751 --> 00:12:38.461
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.


172
00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:39.837
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.


173
00:12:40.004 --> 00:12:42.090
-Show off this Harry Winston.
-(Chuckles)


174
00:12:42.173 --> 00:12:44.509
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.


175
00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:45.718
I should promise you.

176
00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:47.178
-Yes.
- I will.


177
00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:50.640
Thank you.

178
00:12:50.765 --> 00:12:51.933
Dr strange: Tony stark.

179
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.103
I'm doctor Stephen strange.
I need you to come with me.


180
00:12:57.105 --> 00:12:59.691
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.


181
00:12:59.857 --> 00:13:01.651
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?


182
00:13:01.818 --> 00:13:03.236
We need your help.

183
00:13:04.028 --> 00:13:05.613
It's not overselling it
to say that


184
00:13:05.697 --> 00:13:07.282
the fate of the universe
is at stake.


185
00:13:07.448 --> 00:13:08.866
And who's "we"?

186
00:13:10.577 --> 00:13:11.661
Hey, Tony.

187
00:13:11.828 --> 00:13:12.829
Bruce.

188
00:13:12.996 --> 00:13:14.622
-Banner: Pepper.
-Hi.


189
00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:19.252
-Banner: Oh.
-You okay?


190
00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:23.214
Wong: At the dawn
of the universe,


191
00:13:23.298 --> 00:13:25.258
there was nothing. Then...

192
00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:26.926
Boom.

193
00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:30.805
The big bang sent
six elemental crystals...


194
00:13:30.972 --> 00:13:33.808
Hurtling across
the virgin universe.


195
00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:36.394
These infinity stones

196
00:13:36.477 --> 00:13:39.397
each control an essential
aspect of existence.


197
00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:41.524
Dr strange: Space.

198
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:43.818
Reality.

199
00:13:45.445 --> 00:13:46.613
Power.

200
00:13:47.822 --> 00:13:48.990
Soul.

201
00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:51.284
Mind.

202
00:13:53.202 --> 00:13:54.454
And time.

203
00:14:04.047 --> 00:14:05.214
Tell me his name again.

204
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:06.591
Thanos.

205
00:14:06.758 --> 00:14:08.051
He's a plague, Tony.

206
00:14:08.134 --> 00:14:10.011
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.


207
00:14:10.178 --> 00:14:12.305
He wipes out
half the population.


208
00:14:12.472 --> 00:14:14.182
He sent loki.

209
00:14:14.807 --> 00:14:17.727
The attack on New York,
that's him.


210
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:19.437
This is it.

211
00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:21.606
What's our timeline?

212
00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:23.900
No telling. He has
the power and space stones.


213
00:14:24.067 --> 00:14:25.068
That already makes him

214
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:26.694
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.


215
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:30.114
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...


216
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:31.366
He could destroy life

217
00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:33.493
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.


218
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.495
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of'?


219
00:14:35.662 --> 00:14:37.705
Are you seriously leaning
on the cauldron of the cosmos?


220
00:14:37.872 --> 00:14:39.415
-Is that what it is?
-(Clangs)


221
00:14:42.126 --> 00:14:44.045
I'm going to allow that.

222
00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:47.715
If thanos needs all six,
why don't we just


223
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:49.175
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?


224
00:14:49.342 --> 00:14:50.343
No can do.

225
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.221
We swore an oath to protect
the time stone with our lives.


226
00:14:53.388 --> 00:14:54.555
Stark:
And I swore off dairy...


227
00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:57.100
But then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavour after me.


228
00:14:57.266 --> 00:14:58.726
-Stark raving hazelnuts.
-Not bad.


229
00:14:58.893 --> 00:15:00.269
A bit chalky.

230
00:15:00.436 --> 00:15:01.979
A hunk of hulk of
burning fudge is our favourite.


231
00:15:02.146 --> 00:15:03.272
-That's a thing?
-Whatever.


232
00:15:03.356 --> 00:15:04.524
Point is, things change.

233
00:15:04.691 --> 00:15:07.443
Our oath to protect
the time stone cannot change.


234
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.654
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against thanos.


235
00:15:09.821 --> 00:15:10.822
Yeah, So conversely,

236
00:15:10.905 --> 00:15:12.699
It may also be
his best chance against us.


237
00:15:12.865 --> 00:15:14.242
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

238
00:15:14.409 --> 00:15:15.410
What is your job exactly?

239
00:15:15.493 --> 00:15:18.246
besides making
balloon animals.


240
00:15:18.246 --> 00:15:20.790
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.


241
00:15:20.957 --> 00:15:23.459
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?


242
00:15:23.626 --> 00:15:25.503
The fact is
we have this stone.


243
00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:26.879
We know where it is.

244
00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:29.590
Vision is out there somewhere
with the mind stone...


245
00:15:29.757 --> 00:15:31.467
And we have to find him now.

246
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.678
Yeah, that's the thing.

247
00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:34.887
What do you mean?

248
00:15:34.887 --> 00:15:37.098
Two weeks ago, vision turned
off his transponder.


249
00:15:37.181 --> 00:15:38.224
He's offline.

250
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:39.642
-What?
-Yeah.


251
00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:41.728
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?


252
00:15:41.894 --> 00:15:44.147
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.


253
00:15:44.313 --> 00:15:45.773
Who could find vision then?

254
00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:49.777
Stark: (Quietly) Shit.

255
00:15:50.445 --> 00:15:51.446
Probably Steve Rogers.

256
00:15:51.612 --> 00:15:52.780
Oh, great.

257
00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:54.449
Maybe.

258
00:15:55.074 --> 00:15:56.075
But...

259
00:15:57.869 --> 00:15:59.454
(Sighs)

260
00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:00.663
Call him.

261
00:16:01.414 --> 00:16:02.707
It's not that easy.

262
00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:05.585
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?


263
00:16:05.752 --> 00:16:06.753
No.

264
00:16:06.836 --> 00:16:08.504
The avengers broke up.
We're toast.


265
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.214
Broke up?

266
00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:14.010
Like a band?
Like... like the Beatles?


267
00:16:14.177 --> 00:16:16.095
Cap and I fell out hard.

268
00:16:17.096 --> 00:16:18.264
We're not on speaking terms.

269
00:16:19.724 --> 00:16:22.226
Tony, listen to me.

270
00:16:23.311 --> 00:16:24.645
Thor's gone.

271
00:16:26.355 --> 00:16:27.523
Thanos is coming.

272
00:16:27.607 --> 00:16:29.233
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.


273
00:16:36.365 --> 00:16:37.533
(Sighs)

274
00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:47.502
Stark: Flip phone.

275
00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:51.005
(Scoffs)

276
00:16:54.717 --> 00:16:56.511
(Distant rumbling)

277
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.475
(Objects rattling)

278
00:17:08.606 --> 00:17:09.816
Say, doc, you wouldn't
happen to be


279
00:17:09.899 --> 00:17:11.067
moving your hair, would ya?

280
00:17:12.026 --> 00:17:14.237
Not at the moment, no.

281
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.322
(Rumbling continues)

282
00:17:26.374 --> 00:17:28.042
(Muffled screaming)

283
00:17:31.087 --> 00:17:32.713
(Screaming continues)

284
00:17:35.925 --> 00:17:37.885
-(People screaming)
-(Horns honking)


285
00:17:41.514 --> 00:17:43.391
(Sirens wailing)

286
00:17:46.936 --> 00:17:48.771
-You okay?
-(Yelping)


287
00:17:49.897 --> 00:17:50.898
-Help him!
-Wong: Banner!


288
00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:52.650
-Wong! Look alive!
-Go, go! We got it!


289
00:17:52.817 --> 00:17:53.860
Friday, what am I looking at?

290
00:17:53.943 --> 00:17:55.278
Friday: Not sure.
I'm working on it.


291
00:17:55.444 --> 00:17:57.488
Hey! You might wanna
put that time stone


292
00:17:57.572 --> 00:17:58.781
in your back pocket, doc!

293
00:17:58.948 --> 00:18:00.157
Might wanna use it.

294
00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:02.869
(Whooshing)

295
00:18:14.255 --> 00:18:15.673
(Electrical buzzing)

296
00:18:27.602 --> 00:18:29.896
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.


297
00:18:30.062 --> 00:18:31.355
Holy shit.

298
00:18:31.731 --> 00:18:33.190
We're all gonna die!

299
00:18:33.357 --> 00:18:34.567
There's a spaceship!

300
00:18:34.734 --> 00:18:36.444
Boy: What's going on?
Ned: Oh, my god!


301
00:18:36.527 --> 00:18:38.321
(Panicked chatter)

302
00:18:44.994 --> 00:18:46.078
What's the matter
with you kids?


303
00:18:46.162 --> 00:18:47.955
You never seen
a spaceship before?


304
00:19:00.217 --> 00:19:02.553
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd street.


305
00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:03.638
Notify first responders.

306
00:19:03.804 --> 00:19:04.972
Friday:: Will do.

307
00:19:17.818 --> 00:19:19.904
(Sirens wailing in distance)

308
00:19:33.334 --> 00:19:36.253
Hear me and rejoice.

309
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.090
You are about to die

310
00:19:39.173 --> 00:19:41.217
at the hands
of the children of thanos.


311
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.844
-(Speaks alien language)
-Be thankful...


312
00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:46.555
That your meaningless lives
are now contributing...


313
00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:49.684
I'm sorry,
earth is closed today.


314
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.561
You better pack it up
and get outta here.


315
00:19:52.728 --> 00:19:53.854
Stonekeeper.

316
00:19:54.814 --> 00:19:57.066
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?


317
00:19:57.233 --> 00:19:59.026
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.


318
00:19:59.485 --> 00:20:01.904
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.


319
00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:04.365
He means get lost, squidward.

320
00:20:04.532 --> 00:20:05.700
He exhausts me.

321
00:20:05.783 --> 00:20:07.827
-(Speaks alien language)
-Bring me the stone.


322
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.370
(Speaks alien language)

323
00:20:09.453 --> 00:20:10.913
Banner, you want a piece?

324
00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:13.290
Mmm, no, not really.

325
00:20:13.374 --> 00:20:14.667
But when do I ever get
what I want?


326
00:20:14.834 --> 00:20:15.835
That's right.

327
00:20:16.544 --> 00:20:17.753
Okay. Push!

328
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.380
It's been a while.

329
00:20:19.547 --> 00:20:21.048
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.


330
00:20:21.215 --> 00:20:22.216
Okay. Shh.

331
00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:25.052
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.


332
00:20:25.219 --> 00:20:26.512
Come on, come on, man.

333
00:20:26.595 --> 00:20:28.848
-(Growls)
-Banner: God!


334
00:20:29.974 --> 00:20:31.225
Where's your guy?

00:20:31.308 --> 00:20:32.560
(Sighs)

336
00:20:32.643 --> 00:20:34.020
I Don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.


337
00:20:34.186 --> 00:20:35.229
-It's no time for a thing.
- I Know.


338
00:20:35.396 --> 00:20:36.856
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

341
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:45.239
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.


342
00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:47.324
Tony, I'm sorry. (Stammers)
Either I can't or he won't.


343
00:20:47.408 --> 00:20:48.409
It's okay.

344
00:20:48.492 --> 00:20:50.870
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.


345
00:20:51.037 --> 00:20:52.371
-I have him.
-Damn it.

00:21:20.066 --> 00:21:21.233
Where'd that come from?

350
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.443
Iron man: It's nanotech.

351
00:21:22.526 --> 00:21:23.569
You like it?
A little something |i...

Doctor banner, if the rest
of your green friend

(Yelps, grunts)

355
00:21:40.503 --> 00:21:41.796
Iron man: Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.


356
00:21:41.962 --> 00:21:43.255
It stays with me.

357
00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:44.340
Exactly. Bye.

359
00:21:55.476 --> 00:21:57.436
-How we doing? Good? Bad?
-Really, really good.


360
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.646
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?


361
00:21:58.813 --> 00:22:00.106
I'm trying. He won't come out.

362

Come on, hulk!
What are you doing to me?


365
00:22:13.869 --> 00:22:15.996
Come out! Come out! Come out!

366
00:22:16.163 --> 00:22:18.374

(Grunting)

370
00:22:29.802 --> 00:22:31.428
Spider-man: Hey, man.
What's up, mr stark?


371
00:22:31.595 --> 00:22:34.390
-Kid, where'd you come from?
-A field trip to moma.


372
00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:37.893
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, mr stark?


373
00:22:38.811 --> 00:22:40.062
Uh, he's from space.

374
00:22:40.146 --> 00:22:42.106
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

(Both grunt)

380
00:23:08.757 --> 00:23:10.676
Your powers are quaint.

381
00:23:10.676 --> 00:23:12.428
You must be popular
with children.

(Groans)

383
00:23:15.389 --> 00:23:17.183
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.


384
00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:19.310
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

(Grunting)

You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.


389
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.330
You'll only wish
you were dead.

that's the wizard. Get on it.

Gotcha!

00:24:13.197 --> 00:24:14.198
Wait!

Uh, mr stark,
I'm being beamed up.

to my wedding.

Give me a little juice,
Friday.

Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

save the wizard!

We're too high up.
You're running out of air.


414
00:25:29.189 --> 00:25:31.442
Yeah. That makes sense.

415
00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:50.627
Mr stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

Are you all right?
What's going on?


422
00:26:08.604 --> 00:26:09.897
Iron man: Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think


423
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.273
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.


424
00:26:11.357 --> 00:26:12.441
Pepper: Why?

425
00:26:12.524 --> 00:26:14.026
Iron man: Just 'cause
I'll probably


426
00:26:14.109 --> 00:26:15.527
not make it back for a while.

427

you're not on that ship.

you're not on the ship.

I'm sorry,
I Don't know what to say.

Come back here, Tony.
I swear to god.

we're losing her.

Where you going?

This... this is a man.

489
00:29:42.526 --> 00:29:45.279
A handsome, muscular man.

490
00:29:45.445 --> 00:29:46.446
I'm muscular.

491
00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:47.531
But who are you
kidding, quill?


492
00:29:47.614 --> 00:29:48.991
You're one sandwich
away from fat.


493
00:29:49.074 --> 00:29:50.075
Peter: Yeah, right.

494
00:29:50.158 --> 00:29:51.660
Drax: It's true, quill.
You have put on weight.


495
00:29:51.743 --> 00:29:52.744
What?

496
00:29:55.038 --> 00:29:56.873
Gamora, do you think i'm...

497
00:29:59.167 --> 00:30:02.754
He is anxious, angry.

498
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:05.799
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.


499
00:30:06.675 --> 00:30:09.428
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.


500
00:30:09.511 --> 00:30:10.596
Peter: Wow.

501
00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:12.556
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.


502
00:30:12.723 --> 00:30:15.434
I'm gonna get a bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.


503
00:30:15.601 --> 00:30:16.643
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

504
00:30:16.727 --> 00:30:18.061
Rocket: You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?


505
00:30:18.228 --> 00:30:19.438
Gamora: It's like his muscles

506
00:30:19.521 --> 00:30:21.440
are made
of cotati metal fibres.


507
00:30:21.607 --> 00:30:23.317
Stop massaging his muscles.

508
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.027
(Thud)

509
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.111
Wake him up.

510
00:30:29.197 --> 00:30:30.198
(Softly) Wake.

511
00:30:30.532 --> 00:30:32.326
-(Thor yells)
-(All exclaim)


512
00:30:32.409 --> 00:30:33.910
(Clattering)

513
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.038
(Grunts)

514
00:30:37.664 --> 00:30:39.458
(Panting heavily)

515
00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:50.052
Who the hell are you guys?

516
00:30:52.846 --> 00:30:56.475
The entire time I knew thanos,
he only ever had one goal.


517
00:30:56.642 --> 00:30:58.352
To bring balance
to the universe


518
00:30:58.435 --> 00:31:00.604
by wiping out
half of all life.


519
00:31:01.521 --> 00:31:03.732
He used to kill people
planet by planet,


520
00:31:03.815 --> 00:31:05.192
massacre by massacre.

521
00:31:05.484 --> 00:31:06.860
Including my own.

522
00:31:07.027 --> 00:31:08.612
If he gets
all six infinity stones...


523
00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:10.989
He can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.


524
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.576
You seem to know
a great deal about thanos.


525
00:31:14.743 --> 00:31:18.538
Gamora
is the daughter of thanos.


526
00:31:22.584 --> 00:31:24.670
Your father killed my brother.

527
00:31:25.003 --> 00:31:26.213
Oh, boy.

528
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.048
Stepfather, technically.

529
00:31:28.215 --> 00:31:30.133
And she hates him
as much as you do.


530
00:31:33.845 --> 00:31:35.389
Thor: Families can be tough.

531
00:31:35.555 --> 00:31:36.890
Before my father died,

532
00:31:36.973 --> 00:31:38.725
he told me
that I had a half-sister...


533
00:31:38.892 --> 00:31:41.144
That he imprisoned in hel.

534
00:31:41.311 --> 00:31:44.272
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.


535
00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:45.732
So I had to kill her.

536
00:31:45.899 --> 00:31:47.943
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.


537
00:31:48.026 --> 00:31:49.277
Goes round and round and...

538
00:31:50.112 --> 00:31:51.113
I feel your pain.

539
00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:53.573
I feel your pain as Well,
because...


540
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.908
I mean,
it's not a competition,


541
00:31:54.991 --> 00:31:56.118
but I've been through a lot.

542
00:31:56.284 --> 00:31:57.953
-My father killed my mother.
-(Slurping)


543
00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.246
And then I had to kill
my father.


544
00:31:59.329 --> 00:32:00.831
-That was hard.
-(Sighs)


545
00:32:00.997 --> 00:32:03.875
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.


546
00:32:04.418 --> 00:32:07.295
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...


547
00:32:07.462 --> 00:32:09.172
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

548
00:32:11.007 --> 00:32:14.094
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...


549
00:32:14.636 --> 00:32:17.180
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.


550
00:32:17.264 --> 00:32:20.642
-Uh, what are you doing?
-Taking your pod.


551
00:32:20.726 --> 00:32:22.018
(Peter clears throat)

552
00:32:22.102 --> 00:32:23.145
(In deep voice)
No, you're not.


553
00:32:25.272 --> 00:32:29.151
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.


554
00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:33.029
Uh... quill, are you making
your voice deeper?


555
00:32:34.948 --> 00:32:36.575
-No.
-You are.


556
00:32:36.742 --> 00:32:39.453
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.


557
00:32:39.619 --> 00:32:40.787
No, I'm not.

558
00:32:40.954 --> 00:32:42.998
-(Gasps) He just did it again!
-This is my voice.


559
00:32:49.171 --> 00:32:50.172
Are you mocking me?

560
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.550
-Are you mocking me?
-Stop it. You did it again.


561
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.051
He's trying to copy me.

562
00:32:55.135 --> 00:32:56.136
I need you to stop doing that.

563
00:32:56.303 --> 00:32:57.929
-Gamora: Enough!
-He's doing it first.


564
00:32:58.096 --> 00:32:59.473
We need to stop thanos.

565
00:32:59.639 --> 00:33:01.183
Which means
we need to find out


566
00:33:01.266 --> 00:33:02.267
where he's going next.

567
00:33:02.434 --> 00:33:03.685
Knowhere.

568
00:33:03.852 --> 00:33:05.520
He must be going somewhere.

569
00:33:05.687 --> 00:33:07.689
(In normal voice)
No, no. Knowhere?


570
00:33:07.856 --> 00:33:10.525
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.


571
00:33:10.692 --> 00:33:13.111
-Excuse me, that's our food.
-Not any more.


572
00:33:13.528 --> 00:33:16.698
Thor, why would he
go to knowhere?


573
00:33:16.865 --> 00:33:18.033
Thor: Because for years...

574
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.368
The reality stone's been
safely stored there


575
00:33:20.452 --> 00:33:21.870
with a man
called the collector.


576
00:33:22.037 --> 00:33:23.622
Peter: If it's with the
collector, then it's not safe.


577
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:25.499
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.


578
00:33:25.665 --> 00:33:27.042
-Or a genius.
-Gamora: How do you know...


579
00:33:27.209 --> 00:33:29.753
He's not going
for one of the other stones?


580
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.297
There are six stones
out there.


581
00:33:32.464 --> 00:33:34.674
Thanos already has
the power stone...


582
00:33:34.841 --> 00:33:38.136
Because he stole it last week
when he decimated xandar.


583
00:33:38.595 --> 00:33:40.639
He stole the space stone
from me...


584
00:33:40.806 --> 00:33:43.475
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.


585
00:33:43.642 --> 00:33:45.268
The time and mind stones
are safe on earth.


586
00:33:45.352 --> 00:33:46.353
They're with the avengers.

587
00:33:46.686 --> 00:33:48.939
-The avengers?
-Earth's mightiest heroes.


588
00:33:49.105 --> 00:33:50.232
Like Kevin bacon?

589
00:33:50.398 --> 00:33:51.691
He may be on the team.
I Don't know.


590
00:33:51.775 --> 00:33:52.776
I haven't been there
in a while.


591
00:33:52.943 --> 00:33:55.153
As for the soul stone, Well,
no one's ever seen that.


592
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.947
No one even knows where it is.

593
00:33:57.113 --> 00:33:58.865
Therefore thanos can't get it.

594
00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:00.408
Therefore he's going
to knowhere.


595
00:34:00.575 --> 00:34:02.994
Hence he'll be getting
the reality stone.


596
00:34:03.161 --> 00:34:04.204
You're welcome.

597
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:05.580
Then we have to go
to knowhere now.


598
00:34:05.747 --> 00:34:09.417
Wrong. Where we have to go
is nidavellir.


599
00:34:09.876 --> 00:34:11.711
-That's a made-up word.
-All words are made up.


600
00:34:11.878 --> 00:34:14.965
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

601
00:34:15.131 --> 00:34:16.758
That place is a legend.

602
00:34:16.925 --> 00:34:18.343
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons


603
00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:20.470
(chuckling)
To ever torment the universe.


604
00:34:20.637 --> 00:34:22.681
I would very much like
to go there, please.


605
00:34:22.848 --> 00:34:23.849
The rabbit is correct

606
00:34:23.932 --> 00:34:24.975
and clearly the smartest
among you.


607
00:34:25.058 --> 00:34:26.101
Rabbit?

608
00:34:26.268 --> 00:34:28.520
Only eitri the dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.


609
00:34:28.687 --> 00:34:29.896
I assume
you're the captain, sir.


610
00:34:30.063 --> 00:34:31.064
You're very perceptive.

611
00:34:31.231 --> 00:34:32.440
You seem like a noble leader.

612
00:34:32.524 --> 00:34:34.109
Will you join me
on my quest to nidavellir?


613
00:34:34.276 --> 00:34:37.070
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!


614
00:34:37.237 --> 00:34:38.989
-Yeah. I'll go.
-Wonderful!


615
00:34:39.155 --> 00:34:40.282
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.


616
00:34:40.365 --> 00:34:41.366
Thor: Quiet.

617
00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:43.034
-That's my backpack.
-Rocket: Go sit down.


618
00:34:43.201 --> 00:34:44.828
Peter: Look, this is my ship.

619
00:34:44.995 --> 00:34:46.746
And I'm not goin' to...

620
00:34:47.747 --> 00:34:49.833
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?


621
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.251
The thanos-killing kind.

622
00:34:52.085 --> 00:34:53.587
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?


623
00:34:53.753 --> 00:34:55.797
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.


624
00:34:55.964 --> 00:34:57.048
Your bodies would crumble

625
00:34:57.132 --> 00:34:58.300
as your minds collapsed
into madness.


626
00:34:58.466 --> 00:35:00.385
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?


627
00:35:00.552 --> 00:35:01.720
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

628
00:35:01.887 --> 00:35:03.138
If we don't go to knowhere

629
00:35:03.221 --> 00:35:04.806
and thanos retrieves
another stone...


630
00:35:04.973 --> 00:35:06.516
He'll be too powerful to stop.

631
00:35:06.683 --> 00:35:08.852
-He already is.
- I got it figured out.


632
00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:10.729
We got two ships

633
00:35:10.812 --> 00:35:12.188
and a large assortment
of morons.


634
00:35:12.355 --> 00:35:15.609
So me and groot will go
with the pirate angel here.


635
00:35:15.775 --> 00:35:16.943
And the morons
will go to knowhere


636
00:35:17.027 --> 00:35:18.612
to try to stop thanos.

637
00:35:18.778 --> 00:35:20.697
-Cool? Cool.
-So cool.


638
00:35:20.864 --> 00:35:22.157
Peter: For the record...

639
00:35:22.908 --> 00:35:24.242
I Know that
you're going with him


640
00:35:24.326 --> 00:35:25.410
because it's where
thanos isn't.


641
00:35:25.577 --> 00:35:27.078
You know, you really shouldn't

642
00:35:27.162 --> 00:35:29.289
talk that way
to your captain, quill.


643
00:35:30.248 --> 00:35:31.583
Come on, groot.

644
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:34.836
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.


645
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.254
(Video game continues beeping)

646
00:35:38.548 --> 00:35:41.384
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.


647
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:42.677
Bye.

648
00:35:53.063 --> 00:35:55.106
-(High-pitched trilling)
-(Gasps)


649
00:35:57.442 --> 00:35:58.610
Vis?

650
00:35:59.027 --> 00:36:00.946
Is it the stone again?

651
00:36:01.112 --> 00:36:02.739
It's as if
it's speaking to me.


652
00:36:03.365 --> 00:36:05.075
What does it say?

653
00:36:05.992 --> 00:36:08.328
I Don't... I Don't know,
but something.


654
00:36:09.913 --> 00:36:11.790
-(High-pitched trilling)
-Hey.


655
00:36:21.633 --> 00:36:24.135
Tell me what you feel.

656
00:36:31.142 --> 00:36:33.853
I just feel you.

657
00:36:42.028 --> 00:36:43.947
Wanda: So there's a 10:00 A.M.
to Glasgow...


658
00:36:44.114 --> 00:36:46.116
Which would give us more time
together before you went back.


659
00:36:46.282 --> 00:36:47.742
Vision: What if
I miss that train?


660
00:36:47.909 --> 00:36:48.910
There's an 11:00.

661
00:36:49.077 --> 00:36:51.496
What if I missed
all the trains?


662
00:36:52.872 --> 00:36:54.582
What if this time
I didn't go back?


663
00:36:54.749 --> 00:36:56.084
But you gave stark your word.

664
00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:57.419
I'd rather give it to you.

665
00:36:57.585 --> 00:36:59.546
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.


666
00:36:59.713 --> 00:37:01.047
We both made promises.

667
00:37:01.214 --> 00:37:02.924
Not to each other.

668
00:37:03.341 --> 00:37:04.342
Wanda.

669
00:37:05.301 --> 00:37:07.637
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...


670
00:37:07.804 --> 00:37:09.848
Trying to see
if this could work and...


671
00:37:10.015 --> 00:37:11.599
I Don't know. (Stammers)

672
00:37:11.766 --> 00:37:13.727
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.


673
00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:15.603
(Stammers) I think...

674
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:16.855
-Wanda: It works.
-It works.


675
00:37:17.022 --> 00:37:18.314
It works.

676
00:37:20.775 --> 00:37:22.027
Stay.

677
00:37:22.944 --> 00:37:24.612
Stay with me.

678
00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:32.620
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

679
00:37:37.584 --> 00:37:38.626
(Wanda gasps)

680
00:37:39.669 --> 00:37:41.421
What are they?

681
00:37:41.755 --> 00:37:44.174
What the stone
was warning me about.


682
00:37:54.142 --> 00:37:55.477
I have to go.

683
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.561
No, vision.

684
00:37:57.187 --> 00:37:58.438
Vision, if that's true,

685
00:37:58.521 --> 00:38:01.316
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.


686
00:38:02.358 --> 00:38:03.443
Wanda, I...

687
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.653
-Vision!
-(Groaning)


688
00:38:07.781 --> 00:38:08.782
(Growls)

689
00:38:13.203 --> 00:38:14.287
(Grunting)

690
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:16.206
(Screaming)

691
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.501
(Grunts)

692
00:38:27.842 --> 00:38:28.927
(Grunts)

693
00:38:33.807 --> 00:38:36.476
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.


694
00:38:37.393 --> 00:38:39.354
-Is that even possible?
-It isn't supposed to be.


695
00:38:40.438 --> 00:38:42.148
(Distorted)
My systems are failing.


696
00:38:43.066 --> 00:38:45.735
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.


697
00:38:48.279 --> 00:38:49.280
Vis!

698
00:38:53.576 --> 00:38:54.994
(Grunting)

699
00:38:58.373 --> 00:39:01.751
Give up the stone,
and she lives.


700
00:39:01.835 --> 00:39:03.044
(Grunting)

701
00:39:09.175 --> 00:39:10.593
(Grunting)

702
00:39:15.348 --> 00:39:17.100
(Grunting)

703
00:39:26.609 --> 00:39:27.694
(Groans)

704
00:39:28.945 --> 00:39:30.697
(Vision screaming)

705
00:39:35.743 --> 00:39:37.495
(Vision groaning)

706
00:39:39.873 --> 00:39:41.082
Hands off.

707
00:39:49.591 --> 00:39:50.592
(Wanda gasps)

708
00:39:52.635 --> 00:39:54.846
(Both grunting)

709
00:39:54.929 --> 00:39:56.806
(Both groaning)

710
00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.141
Come on. Come on.

711
00:39:58.308 --> 00:40:00.101
Come on, you gotta get up.

712
00:40:00.268 --> 00:40:02.478
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.


713
00:40:03.563 --> 00:40:04.981
Hey. We have to go.

714
00:40:05.356 --> 00:40:06.399
(Sighs)

715
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.485
Please. Please leave.

716
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:11.404
You asked me to stay.

717
00:40:12.655 --> 00:40:13.823
-I'm staying.
-Please.


718
00:40:29.881 --> 00:40:31.299
(Train horn blaring)

719
00:40:39.015 --> 00:40:40.391
(Grunts)

720
00:40:50.151 --> 00:40:51.444
(Falcon grunts)

721
00:41:00.662 --> 00:41:01.663
(Grunting)

722
00:41:02.705 --> 00:41:03.706
(Screams)

723
00:41:10.213 --> 00:41:12.006
(Yelling)

724
00:41:16.261 --> 00:41:18.137
(All grunting)

725
00:41:25.019 --> 00:41:26.729
-Get up.
-I can't.


726
00:41:26.896 --> 00:41:29.607
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.


727
00:41:29.774 --> 00:41:31.943
You'll never get
the chance again.


728
00:41:47.917 --> 00:41:49.460
Can you stand?

729
00:41:49.794 --> 00:41:50.837
(Vision grunts)

730
00:41:54.215 --> 00:41:55.633
Thank you, captain.

731
00:41:58.344 --> 00:41:59.971
Let's get you on the jet.

732
00:42:03.933 --> 00:42:07.353
Now, I thought we had a deal.

733
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.232
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.


734
00:42:11.399 --> 00:42:12.734
Wanda: I'm sorry.

735
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.694
We just wanted time.

736
00:42:17.405 --> 00:42:18.656
Sam: Where to, cap?

737
00:42:21.492 --> 00:42:22.994
Home.

738
00:42:24.662 --> 00:42:26.497
-(Girl sobbing)
(Woman shushing)


739
00:42:26.581 --> 00:42:28.624
Woman: We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.


740
00:42:28.708 --> 00:42:30.543
-(People screaming)
-(Guns firing)


741
00:42:34.213 --> 00:42:35.631
-(Explosion)
-(Screams)


742
00:42:36.632 --> 00:42:38.301
(Alien speaks alien language)

743
00:42:41.429 --> 00:42:42.430
(Both screaming)

744
00:42:43.806 --> 00:42:45.641
(People screaming)

745
00:42:53.191 --> 00:42:54.233
Ebony maw: (On loudspeaker)
Zehobereians.


746
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.152
Mother! Where's my mother?

747
00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:57.653
Ebony maw:
Choose a side or die.


748
00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.280
Girl: Mother!

749
00:42:59.447 --> 00:43:01.616
Ebony <i>maw: One side
is a revelation...</i>


750
00:43:01.783 --> 00:43:04.827
The other an honour
known only to a few.


751
00:43:05.745 --> 00:43:07.205
What's wrong, little one?

752
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.250
My mother. Where is my mother?

753
00:43:16.047 --> 00:43:17.256
What's your name?

754
00:43:18.591 --> 00:43:20.259
Gamora.

755
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.887
You're quite the fighter,
gamora.


756
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:25.431
Come.

757
00:43:25.807 --> 00:43:26.808
Let me help you.

758
00:43:40.321 --> 00:43:41.447
Look.

759
00:43:43.241 --> 00:43:44.409
(Clinks)

760
00:43:45.118 --> 00:43:46.786
Pretty, isn't it?

761
00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:50.998
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.


762
00:43:51.165 --> 00:43:54.919
Too much to one side
or the other...


763
00:43:58.923 --> 00:44:01.759
Here. You try.

764
00:44:05.513 --> 00:44:08.599
Ebony maw: Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.


765
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:11.936
-(People screaming)
-Thanos: Uh-uh.


766
00:44:13.855 --> 00:44:15.398
Concentrate.

767
00:44:15.481 --> 00:44:17.233
(Screaming continues)

768
00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:21.154
There. You've got it.

769
00:44:27.994 --> 00:44:29.036
(Clinks)

770
00:44:30.663 --> 00:44:31.747
Peter: Gamora.

771
00:44:32.832 --> 00:44:33.916
Do you know if these grenades

772
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.169
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?


773
00:44:36.335 --> 00:44:37.420
Because I was thinking about

774
00:44:37.503 --> 00:44:39.088
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.


775
00:44:39.172 --> 00:44:40.256
But I Don't want to
if they're the...


776
00:44:40.339 --> 00:44:41.591
Gamora: I need to ask a favour.

777
00:44:42.508 --> 00:44:43.843
Yeah, sure.

778
00:44:45.386 --> 00:44:46.471
Gamora: One way or another,

779
00:44:46.554 --> 00:44:48.806
the path that we're on
leads to thanos.


780
00:44:50.558 --> 00:44:52.059
Which is what
the grenades are for.


781
00:44:52.977 --> 00:44:55.313
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favour?


782
00:44:57.648 --> 00:44:58.649
If things go wrong...

783
00:45:00.276 --> 00:45:02.403
If thanos gets me...

784
00:45:06.949 --> 00:45:08.910
I want you to promise me...

785
00:45:09.952 --> 00:45:11.078
You'll kill me.

786
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:12.830
What?

787
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.377
I Know something he doesn't.

788
00:45:20.922 --> 00:45:23.132
And if he finds it out,

789
00:45:23.216 --> 00:45:24.592
the entire universe
could be at risk.


790
00:45:25.259 --> 00:45:26.344
What do you know?

791
00:45:26.511 --> 00:45:28.554
If I tell you, you'd know too.

792
00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:33.434
If it's So important...

793
00:45:33.518 --> 00:45:34.560
Shouldn't I?

794
00:45:34.727 --> 00:45:35.937
Only if you wanna die.

795
00:45:36.103 --> 00:45:37.688
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?


796
00:45:39.106 --> 00:45:40.107
Just...

797
00:45:42.527 --> 00:45:45.530
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.


798
00:45:45.696 --> 00:45:48.032
I mean, I'd like to.

799
00:45:48.199 --> 00:45:50.034
- I really would. But you...
-(Sighs)


800
00:45:50.201 --> 00:45:51.410
Swear to me.

801
00:45:52.495 --> 00:45:53.496
(Shudders)

802
00:45:54.914 --> 00:45:57.208
Swear to me on your mother.

803
00:46:04.215 --> 00:46:05.216
Okay.

804
00:46:11.305 --> 00:46:12.431
Okay.

805
00:46:20.439 --> 00:46:22.525
(Loud crunching)

806
00:46:25.778 --> 00:46:27.780
(Continues crunching)

807
00:46:28.656 --> 00:46:29.699
-Oh.
-Dude.


808
00:46:29.782 --> 00:46:31.325
How long have you been
standing there?


809
00:46:31.409 --> 00:46:32.410
An hour.

810
00:46:32.952 --> 00:46:34.203
An hour?

811
00:46:34.745 --> 00:46:36.038
Are you serious?

812
00:46:36.205 --> 00:46:38.374
I've mastered the ability

813
00:46:38.457 --> 00:46:41.127
of standing
So incredibly still...


814
00:46:42.336 --> 00:46:44.922
That I become
invisible to the eye.


815
00:46:45.548 --> 00:46:46.549
Watch.

816
00:46:50.469 --> 00:46:52.054
You're eating a zarg-nut.

817
00:46:52.513 --> 00:46:53.931
But my movement...

818
00:46:54.765 --> 00:46:56.392
Was So slow...

819
00:46:57.226 --> 00:46:59.061
That it's imperceptible.

820
00:46:59.228 --> 00:47:00.229
Mmm, no.

821
00:47:00.313 --> 00:47:02.648
(Crunching)
I'm sure I'm invisible.


822
00:47:02.815 --> 00:47:03.983
Mantis: Hi, drax.

823
00:47:06.694 --> 00:47:07.695
Damn it.

824
00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.342
This place looks deserted.

825
00:47:29.508 --> 00:47:32.261
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.


826
00:47:32.428 --> 00:47:34.347
Peter: Yep,
I'm picking that up too.


827
00:47:35.765 --> 00:47:37.224
Let's put down right here.

828
00:47:48.986 --> 00:47:50.529
The collector:
I Don't have it.


829
00:47:52.657 --> 00:47:54.367
Thanos: Everyone
in the galaxy knows


830
00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:55.868
you'd sell your own brother...

831
00:47:56.035 --> 00:47:57.662
If you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...


832
00:47:57.828 --> 00:47:59.747
To your pathetic collection.

833
00:48:07.546 --> 00:48:09.965
I Know you have
the reality stone, tivan.


834
00:48:10.925 --> 00:48:14.387
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.


835
00:48:15.721 --> 00:48:16.764
(Groans)

836
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.225
The collector: (Strained)
I told you.


837
00:48:20.017 --> 00:48:21.018
I sold it.

838
00:48:23.896 --> 00:48:25.898
Why would I lie?

839
00:48:26.065 --> 00:48:28.275
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.


840
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:30.820
Like suicide.

841
00:48:30.986 --> 00:48:32.488
You do understand.

842
00:48:33.447 --> 00:48:36.450
Not even you would surrender
something So precious.


843
00:48:36.617 --> 00:48:37.993
I didn't know what it was.

844
00:48:38.369 --> 00:48:40.955
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.


845
00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:42.331
It's him.

846
00:48:42.498 --> 00:48:43.958
Thanos: Last chance,
charlatan.


847
00:48:44.041 --> 00:48:45.418
(Wheezing)

848
00:48:45.501 --> 00:48:47.461
Where's the stone?

849
00:48:47.628 --> 00:48:48.629
Today...

850
00:48:49.046 --> 00:48:50.047
(Whispering) Drax. Drax.

851
00:48:50.214 --> 00:48:52.174
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.


852
00:48:52.258 --> 00:48:53.300
Drax, wait.

853
00:48:54.802 --> 00:48:56.178
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

854
00:48:56.345 --> 00:48:57.596
Drax.

855
00:49:01.475 --> 00:49:03.728
Drax, drax, drax.
Listen to me.


856
00:49:03.894 --> 00:49:06.147
He doesn't have the stone yet.

857
00:49:06.313 --> 00:49:07.940
If we get it,
then we can stop him.


858
00:49:08.774 --> 00:49:11.944
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.


859
00:49:12.111 --> 00:49:13.195
No.

860
00:49:13.362 --> 00:49:16.407
No. For ovette, for camaria.

861
00:49:16.866 --> 00:49:18.159
(Softly) Sleep.

862
00:49:19.326 --> 00:49:20.327
(Thud)

863
00:49:28.502 --> 00:49:29.879
(Groans)

864
00:49:30.087 --> 00:49:31.088
(Whispering) Okay.

865
00:49:31.255 --> 00:49:36.719
Gamora, mantis, you go right.

866
00:49:36.719 --> 00:49:37.970
The other right.

867
00:49:39.597 --> 00:49:40.848
(Yells)

868
00:49:45.186 --> 00:49:46.395
(Groans)

869
00:49:48.105 --> 00:49:49.190
(Groaning)

870
00:49:51.525 --> 00:49:52.943
(Gurgling)

871
00:50:02.286 --> 00:50:03.996
Why?

872
00:50:08.209 --> 00:50:09.502
(Groaning)

873
00:50:14.006 --> 00:50:18.052
Why you, daughter?

874
00:50:20.137 --> 00:50:21.806
(Sobbing)

875
00:50:21.889 --> 00:50:23.140
(Blade clatters)

876
00:50:27.186 --> 00:50:29.021
(Continues sobbing)

877
00:50:36.695 --> 00:50:37.696
That was quick.

878
00:50:43.494 --> 00:50:48.374
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!


879
00:50:50.709 --> 00:50:53.420
Thanos: Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?


880
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:59.051
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.


881
00:51:06.433 --> 00:51:09.687
But one never knows for sure.

882
00:51:18.904 --> 00:51:21.740
Reality is often
disappointing.


883
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.162
That is, it was.

884
00:51:29.206 --> 00:51:30.583
Now...

885
00:51:32.585 --> 00:51:35.379
Reality can be
whatever I want.


886
00:51:36.922 --> 00:51:38.382
You knew I'd come.

887
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:40.175
Thanos: I counted on it.

888
00:51:40.968 --> 00:51:43.888
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.


889
00:51:45.723 --> 00:51:47.558
(Gamora grunts, screams)

890
00:51:48.517 --> 00:51:50.227
Thanos!

891
00:51:57.818 --> 00:51:58.861
No!

892
00:52:00.905 --> 00:52:01.947
(Groans)

893
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.825
Let her go, grimace.

894
00:52:05.284 --> 00:52:06.285
Gamora: Peter.

895
00:52:07.745 --> 00:52:08.996
I told you to go right.

896
00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:10.956
Now? Really?

897
00:52:11.123 --> 00:52:12.541
You let her go!

898
00:52:12.958 --> 00:52:14.668
-Ah, the boyfriend.
-(Groans)


899
00:52:14.835 --> 00:52:15.836
no.

900
00:52:16.003 --> 00:52:17.171
Like to think of myself

901
00:52:17.254 --> 00:52:19.715
More as a titan-killing,
long-term Booty call.


902
00:52:19.882 --> 00:52:21.926
-Let her go.
-Peter.


903
00:52:22.092 --> 00:52:27.389
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.


904
00:52:27.389 --> 00:52:28.891
Not him.

905
00:52:31.769 --> 00:52:33.604
(Panting)

906
00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.072
You promised. You promised.

907
00:52:47.242 --> 00:52:48.452
Thanos: Oh, daughter.

908
00:52:48.911 --> 00:52:51.413
You expect too much from him.

909
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.585
She's asked, hasn't she?

910
00:53:00.547 --> 00:53:01.548
Do it.

911
00:53:05.386 --> 00:53:06.637
Mmm.

912
00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:11.475
-(Gamora yelps)
-Do it!


913
00:53:11.475 --> 00:53:12.893
(Shuddering)

914
00:53:16.063 --> 00:53:17.481
I told you to go right.

915
00:53:19.441 --> 00:53:22.403
I love you more than anything.

916
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:27.032
I love you too.

917
00:53:29.702 --> 00:53:31.829
(Breathing rapidly)

918
00:53:41.338 --> 00:53:42.381
I like him.

919
00:54:13.287 --> 00:54:14.955
Secretary Ross: (On speaker)
Still no word from vision?


920
00:54:15.164 --> 00:54:17.791
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.


921
00:54:18.417 --> 00:54:19.460
On a stolen quinjet

922
00:54:19.543 --> 00:54:21.336
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.


923
00:54:21.795 --> 00:54:23.380
You know they're
only criminals because


924
00:54:23.464 --> 00:54:24.965
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?


925
00:54:25.132 --> 00:54:26.258
My god, rhodes.

926
00:54:26.425 --> 00:54:29.636
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.


927
00:54:29.803 --> 00:54:30.929
If it weren't
for those accords,


928
00:54:31.013 --> 00:54:32.389
vision would've been
right here.


929
00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:36.351
I remember your signature
on those papers, colonel.


930
00:54:36.852 --> 00:54:37.853
That's right.

931
00:54:39.855 --> 00:54:41.690
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.


932
00:54:41.857 --> 00:54:43.067
You have second thoughts?

933
00:54:43.233 --> 00:54:44.943
Not any more.

934
00:54:50.783 --> 00:54:52.367
Mr secretary.

935
00:54:56.914 --> 00:54:58.582
You got some nerve.

936
00:54:59.249 --> 00:55:00.876
I'll give you that.

937
00:55:01.043 --> 00:55:02.795
You could use
some of that right now.


938
00:55:03.629 --> 00:55:09.760
The world's on fire.

939
00:55:06.673 --> 00:55:10.344
And you think all is forgiven?

940
00:55:10.344 --> 00:55:12.221
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.


941
00:55:12.304 --> 00:55:14.431
And I'm way past
asking permission.


942
00:55:16.391 --> 00:55:18.435
Earth just lost
her best defender.


943
00:55:18.936 --> 00:55:20.145
So we're here to fight.

944
00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:23.649
And if you wanna
stand in our way...


945
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:26.568
We'll fight you too.

946
00:55:29.822 --> 00:55:30.823
Arrest them.

947
00:55:31.949 --> 00:55:33.534
All over it.

948
00:55:36.787 --> 00:55:38.539
(Computer beeps)

949
00:55:38.622 --> 00:55:39.998
That's a court-martial.

950
00:55:42.459 --> 00:55:43.460
It's great to see you, cap.

951
00:55:44.586 --> 00:55:46.338
-You too, Rhodey.
-(Rhodes chuckles)


952
00:55:46.421 --> 00:55:47.422
Hey.

953
00:55:48.757 --> 00:55:51.051
(Sighs) Wow. You guys...

954
00:55:51.885 --> 00:55:53.887
Really look like crap.

955
00:55:54.054 --> 00:55:55.639
Must've been
a rough couple years.


956
00:55:55.806 --> 00:55:58.475
Yeah, Well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.


957
00:55:58.934 --> 00:56:01.103
Banner: Uh, I think
you look great.


958
00:56:04.439 --> 00:56:05.524
Uh...

959
00:56:07.067 --> 00:56:08.110
(Chuckles)

960
00:56:08.193 --> 00:56:10.237
Yeah, I'm back.

961
00:56:11.905 --> 00:56:12.906
Hi, Bruce.

962
00:56:18.453 --> 00:56:19.454
Nat.

963
00:56:22.875 --> 00:56:24.418
This is awkward.

964
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.463
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?


965
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:29.798
And they can clearly find us.

966
00:56:29.965 --> 00:56:32.176
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?


967
00:56:32.467 --> 00:56:33.927
After the whole
accords situation,


968
00:56:34.052 --> 00:56:35.554
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough


969
00:56:35.721 --> 00:56:37.264
on their families.
They're on house arrest.


970
00:56:37.389 --> 00:56:38.682
-Banner: Who's Scott?
-Ant-man.


971
00:56:38.849 --> 00:56:40.309
There's an ant-man
and a spider-man?


972
00:56:41.226 --> 00:56:42.269
Okay, look.

973
00:56:42.352 --> 00:56:45.189
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...


974
00:56:45.355 --> 00:56:48.775
And he is not gonna stop
until he gets...


975
00:56:50.611 --> 00:56:51.653
Vision's stone.

976
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.071
Then we have to protect it.

977
00:56:53.238 --> 00:56:54.865
No, we have to destroy it.

978
00:56:57.034 --> 00:56:58.327
I've been giving
a good deal of thought


979
00:56:58.410 --> 00:56:59.411
to this entity in my head.

980
00:56:59.578 --> 00:57:01.079
About its nature.

981
00:57:01.622 --> 00:57:03.790
But also its composition.

982
00:57:03.957 --> 00:57:05.959
I think if it were exposed

983
00:57:06.043 --> 00:57:07.878
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...


984
00:57:08.045 --> 00:57:11.882
Something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...


985
00:57:13.467 --> 00:57:15.636
Its molecular integrity
could fail.


986
00:57:16.178 --> 00:57:18.430
Yeah, and you with it.

987
00:57:18.889 --> 00:57:20.349
We're not having
this conversation.


988
00:57:20.515 --> 00:57:22.517
Vision: Eliminating the stone
is the only way


989
00:57:22.601 --> 00:57:24.603
to be certain that
thanos can't get it.


990
00:57:25.145 --> 00:57:27.356
That's too high a price.

991
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.238
Only you have
the power to pay it.


992
00:57:38.492 --> 00:57:40.535
Thanos threatens
half the universe.


993
00:57:40.702 --> 00:57:43.247
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.


994
00:57:43.413 --> 00:57:44.831
But it should.

995
00:57:47.334 --> 00:57:48.710
We don't trade lives, vision.

996
00:57:48.877 --> 00:57:50.837
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...


997
00:57:51.004 --> 00:57:52.798
To save how many
millions of people?


998
00:57:52.965 --> 00:57:55.008
Tell me,
why is this any different?


999
00:57:55.175 --> 00:57:57.469
Banner: Because you might
have a choice.


1000
00:57:58.762 --> 00:58:00.097
Your mind is made up

1001
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.557
of a complex construct
of overlays.


1002
00:58:02.724 --> 00:58:06.311
Jarvis, ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.


1003
00:58:06.478 --> 00:58:08.230
All of them mixed together,

1004
00:58:08.313 --> 00:58:09.815
all of them
learning from one another.


1005
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:11.942
You're saying vision isn't
just the stone?


1006
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:15.195
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...


1007
00:58:15.362 --> 00:58:16.780
There's still a whole lot
of vision left.


1008
00:58:16.863 --> 00:58:18.323
Perhaps the best parts.

1009
00:58:18.657 --> 00:58:19.992
Can we do that?

1010
00:58:20.701 --> 00:58:21.743
Not me, not here.

1011
00:58:22.744 --> 00:58:31.420
Rhodes: Well,
you better find someone


1012
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:25.539
And somewhere fast.

1013
00:58:25.706 --> 00:58:27.082
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys


1014
00:58:27.165 --> 00:58:28.375
have your old rooms back.

1015
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:41.420
I Know somewhere.

1016
00:58:47.644 --> 00:58:48.895
Okoye: The kingsguard

1017
00:58:48.979 --> 00:58:50.272
and the dora milaje
have been alerted.


1018
00:58:50.439 --> 00:58:51.982
And the border tribe?

1019
00:58:52.441 --> 00:58:54.026
Those that are left.

1020
00:58:54.318 --> 00:58:56.445
Send word
to the Jabari as Well.


1021
00:58:56.611 --> 00:58:58.697
M'Baku likes a good fight.

1022
00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:00.032
(Speaks xhosa)

1023
00:59:00.991 --> 00:59:02.701
(In English)
And what of this one?


1024
00:59:03.327 --> 00:59:05.454
This one may be tired of war.

1025
00:59:05.787 --> 00:59:08.832
But the white wolf
has rested long enough.


1026
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.065
Where's the fight?

1027
00:59:33.982 --> 00:59:35.400
On its way.

1028
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.409
(Groans softly)

1029
00:59:49.539 --> 00:59:50.707
(Gasps)

1030
00:59:53.794 --> 00:59:56.380
In all the time
I've served thanos...


1031
00:59:58.256 --> 01:00:00.258
I have never failed him.

1032
01:00:05.347 --> 01:00:08.433
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on titan...


1033
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.185
With the time stone
still attached


1034
01:00:10.268 --> 01:00:12.437
to your vaguely
irritating person...


1035
01:00:12.604 --> 01:00:15.190
There would be judgement.

1036
01:00:21.113 --> 01:00:22.697
(Grunting softly)

1037
01:00:23.782 --> 01:00:25.325
Give me...

1038
01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.161
(Grunts)

1039
01:00:29.162 --> 01:00:30.163
The stone.

1040
01:00:42.759 --> 01:00:44.010
Wow, you're a seriously

1041
01:00:44.094 --> 01:00:45.178
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?


1042
01:00:45.345 --> 01:00:47.389
Spider-man: Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...


1043
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:48.932
Stark: What the...

1044
01:00:49.099 --> 01:00:50.851
-I Know what you're gonna say.
-You should not be here.


1045
01:00:51.017 --> 01:00:52.060
-I was gonna go home.
-I Don't wanna hear it.


1046
01:00:52.227 --> 01:00:53.228
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought


1047
01:00:53.311 --> 01:00:54.563
-about you on the way...
-And now I gotta hear it.


1048
01:00:54.646 --> 01:00:55.647
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.


1049
01:00:55.814 --> 01:00:57.858
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.


1050
01:00:58.024 --> 01:00:59.025
God damn it.

1051
01:00:59.192 --> 01:01:01.987
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.


1052
01:01:02.154 --> 01:01:03.488
-What did you just say?
-(Stutters) I take that back.


1053
01:01:03.655 --> 01:01:04.948
And now, I'm here in space.

1054
01:01:05.115 --> 01:01:07.534
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.


1055
01:01:07.701 --> 01:01:09.786
This isn't coney island.
This isn't a field trip.


1056
01:01:09.953 --> 01:01:11.204
This is a one-way ticket.

1057
01:01:11.288 --> 01:01:12.831
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.


1058
01:01:12.914 --> 01:01:13.915
No, I did think this through.

1059
01:01:13.999 --> 01:01:15.625
You could not have possibly
thought this through.


1060
01:01:15.792 --> 01:01:17.294
You can't be a friendly
neighbourhood spider-man...


1061
01:01:17.461 --> 01:01:19.045
If there's no neighbourhood.

1062
01:01:21.214 --> 01:01:22.340
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,


1063
01:01:22.424 --> 01:01:23.758
but you know
what I'm trying to say.


1064
01:01:25.886 --> 01:01:28.763
(Breathes shakily)
Come on. We got a situation.


1065
01:01:29.764 --> 01:01:30.765
See him down there?
He's in trouble.


1066
01:01:30.849 --> 01:01:31.850
What's your plan?

1067
01:01:31.933 --> 01:01:33.101
-Go.
-Um...


1068
01:01:33.768 --> 01:01:35.187
Okay, okay... uh...

1069
01:01:35.479 --> 01:01:38.690
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, aliens?


1070
01:01:38.773 --> 01:01:40.775
(Screaming)

1071
01:01:42.402 --> 01:01:44.488
Ebony maw:
Painful, aren't they?


1072
01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.241
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.


1073
01:01:48.909 --> 01:01:50.994
-And any one of them...
-(Thud)


1074
01:01:56.082 --> 01:01:58.293
Could end your friend's life
in an instant.


1075
01:01:58.877 --> 01:02:00.504
Iron man: / gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.


1076
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:03.340
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.


1077
01:02:05.133 --> 01:02:06.885
You've saved nothing.

1078
01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:09.763
Your powers
are inconsequential


1079
01:02:09.846 --> 01:02:11.056
compared to mine.

1080
01:02:11.473 --> 01:02:13.099
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.


1081
01:02:16.686 --> 01:02:17.687
(Yelps)

1082
01:02:18.396 --> 01:02:19.898
(Grunting)

1083
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:24.402
(Grunts)

1084
01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.449
Spider-man: Yes! Wait.
What are those?


1085
01:02:32.244 --> 01:02:33.828
(Yelling)

1086
01:02:39.501 --> 01:02:40.669
(Grunts)

1087
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:46.800
Spider-man: Hey,
we haven't officially met.


1088
01:02:48.093 --> 01:02:49.177
Cool.

1089
01:02:51.179 --> 01:02:52.639
We gotta turn
this ship around.


1090
01:02:52.764 --> 01:02:54.808
Stark: Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.


1091
01:02:54.975 --> 01:02:56.351
No, I want to protect
the stone.


1092
01:02:56.518 --> 01:02:57.727
Stark: And I want you
to thank me.


1093
01:02:57.811 --> 01:02:59.312
Now, go ahead. 
I'm listening.

1094
01:02:59.479 --> 01:03:02.190
Dr strange: For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?


1095
01:03:02.357 --> 01:03:04.609
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.


1096
01:03:04.776 --> 01:03:05.777
I seriously don't know

1097
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.028
how you fit your head
into that helmet.


1098
01:03:07.195 --> 01:03:09.447
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.


1099
01:03:09.614 --> 01:03:11.116
I tried to bench you.
You refused.


1100
01:03:11.283 --> 01:03:13.201
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I Don't work for you.


1101
01:03:13.368 --> 01:03:14.953
And due to that fact,

1102
01:03:15.036 --> 01:03:16.371
we're now
in a flying doughnut...


1103
01:03:16.538 --> 01:03:18.206
Billions of miles from earth
with no backup.


1104
01:03:18.373 --> 01:03:20.292
-I'm backup.
-No, you're a stowaway.


1105
01:03:20.458 --> 01:03:21.459
The adults are talking.

1106
01:03:21.626 --> 01:03:24.212
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.


1107
01:03:24.379 --> 01:03:26.006
What is he, your ward?

1108
01:03:26.172 --> 01:03:27.173
No.

1109
01:03:27.674 --> 01:03:29.551
-I'm Peter, by the way.
-Doctor strange.


1110
01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:31.428
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...


1111
01:03:32.387 --> 01:03:33.638
I'm spider-man, then.

1112
01:03:34.556 --> 01:03:36.057
This ship is
self-correcting its course.


1113
01:03:36.141 --> 01:03:37.142
Thing's on autopilot.

1114
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:39.019
Dr strange:
Can we control it?


1115
01:03:39.185 --> 01:03:41.104
Fly us home?

1116
01:03:44.107 --> 01:03:45.108
-Stark?
-Yeah.


1117
01:03:45.275 --> 01:03:46.526
Can you get us home?

1118
01:03:46.693 --> 01:03:47.944
Yeah, I heard you.

1119
01:03:49.237 --> 01:03:51.698
I'm thinking I'm not
So sure we should.


1120
01:03:52.365 --> 01:03:53.867
Under no circumstances

1121
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:56.494
can we bring
the time stone to thanos.


1122
01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:57.829
I Don't think
you quite understand


1123
01:03:57.912 --> 01:03:58.913
what's at stake here.

1124
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.416
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...


1125
01:04:01.583 --> 01:04:04.336
That thanos has been
inside my head for six years.


1126
01:04:04.502 --> 01:04:06.087
Since he sent an army
to New York


1127
01:04:06.171 --> 01:04:07.714
and now he's back.

1128
01:04:07.881 --> 01:04:09.799
And I Don't know what to do.

1129
01:04:09.966 --> 01:04:11.134
So I'm not So sure

1130
01:04:11.217 --> 01:04:13.011
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...


1131
01:04:13.178 --> 01:04:16.806
But you saw what they did,
what they can do.


1132
01:04:16.973 --> 01:04:19.184
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.


1133
01:04:19.351 --> 01:04:22.103
So I say we take
the fight to him.


1134
01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.271
Doctor.

1135
01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:26.650
Do you concur?

1136
01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:31.696
All right, stark.
We go to him.


1137
01:04:32.781 --> 01:04:34.824
But you have to understand...

1138
01:04:34.991 --> 01:04:36.660
If it comes to saving you

1139
01:04:36.743 --> 01:04:39.204
or the kid
or the time stone...


1140
01:04:39.371 --> 01:04:42.207
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.


1141
01:04:43.041 --> 01:04:46.711
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.


1142
01:04:47.295 --> 01:04:50.173
Nice. Good, moral compass.
(Pats arm)


1143
01:04:51.466 --> 01:04:54.094
We're straight.

1144
01:04:54.094 --> 01:04:55.595
(Sighs) All right, kid.

1145
01:04:56.888 --> 01:04:57.931
You're an avenger now.

1146
01:05:34.509 --> 01:05:36.803
Thanos: I thought
you might be hungry.


1147
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.525
I always hated that chair.

1148
01:05:50.692 --> 01:05:52.736
Thanos: So I've been told.

1149
01:05:53.403 --> 01:05:57.323
Even So, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.


1150
01:05:58.074 --> 01:05:59.617
I hated this room.

1151
01:06:00.493 --> 01:06:01.786
This ship.

1152
01:06:01.953 --> 01:06:03.747
I hated my life.

1153
01:06:08.168 --> 01:06:10.420
Thanos: You told me that too.

1154
01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:14.966
Every day.

1155
01:06:17.761 --> 01:06:19.721
For almost 20 years.

1156
01:06:22.265 --> 01:06:24.684
I was a child
when you took me.


1157
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.895
I saved you.

1158
01:06:30.398 --> 01:06:31.399
No.

1159
01:06:32.901 --> 01:06:36.446
No. We were happy
on my home planet.


1160
01:06:36.613 --> 01:06:37.781
Going to bed hungry...

1161
01:06:38.281 --> 01:06:39.991
Scrounging for scraps.

1162
01:06:40.158 --> 01:06:43.036
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.


1163
01:06:43.119 --> 01:06:45.205
I'm the one who stopped that.

1164
01:06:45.663 --> 01:06:47.499
Do you know
what's happened since then?


1165
01:06:47.665 --> 01:06:49.292
The children born...

1166
01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:53.296
Have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.


1167
01:06:53.463 --> 01:06:54.714
It's a paradise.

1168
01:06:57.383 --> 01:06:59.260
Because you murdered
half the planet.


1169
01:06:59.427 --> 01:07:02.305
A small price to pay
for salvation.


1170
01:07:02.472 --> 01:07:03.473
You're insane.

1171
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.600
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.


1172
01:07:05.767 --> 01:07:08.561
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.


1173
01:07:09.103 --> 01:07:13.107
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.


1174
01:07:13.525 --> 01:07:14.609
It needs correction.

1175
01:07:14.776 --> 01:07:16.152
You don't know that!

1176
01:07:17.695 --> 01:07:19.739
I'm the only one
who knows that.


1177
01:07:20.532 --> 01:07:24.744
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.


1178
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:27.330
For a time...

1179
01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:34.170
You had that same will...

1180
01:07:35.755 --> 01:07:38.174
As you fought by my side.

1181
01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:40.093
Daughter.

1182
01:07:40.885 --> 01:07:42.679
I'm not your daughter.

1183
01:07:45.098 --> 01:07:47.851
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.


1184
01:07:48.643 --> 01:07:50.061
And, in doing So,

1185
01:07:50.144 --> 01:07:52.397
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.


1186
01:07:55.316 --> 01:07:58.152
That's why I trusted you
to find the soul stone.


1187
01:08:01.531 --> 01:08:03.992
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1188
01:08:04.367 --> 01:08:05.451
(Thanos sighs)

1189
01:08:05.535 --> 01:08:07.328
I am disappointed.

1190
01:08:08.121 --> 01:08:10.582
But not because
you didn't find it.


1191
01:08:14.294 --> 01:08:15.920
But because you did.

1192
01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.132
And you lied.

1193
01:08:36.232 --> 01:08:37.358
Gamora: Nebula.

1194
01:08:44.616 --> 01:08:45.950
Don't do this.

1195
01:08:46.117 --> 01:08:47.327
Thanos: Some time ago,

1196
01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:50.121
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.


1197
01:08:50.288 --> 01:08:51.289
Please don't do this.

1198
01:08:51.372 --> 01:08:53.666
Thanos:
And very nearly succeeded.


1199
01:08:54.334 --> 01:08:55.793
So I brought her here.

1200
01:08:57.337 --> 01:08:58.588
To talk.

1201
01:09:00.924 --> 01:09:02.216
(Screaming)

1202
01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.640
Stop. Stop it.

1203
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.856
I swear to you on my life.

1204
01:09:17.357 --> 01:09:19.651
I never found the soul stone.

1205
01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.365
Nebula:
Accessing memory files.


1206
01:09:25.531 --> 01:09:26.866
You know
what he's about to do.


1207
01:09:27.033 --> 01:09:29.619
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.


1208
01:09:29.786 --> 01:09:30.912
-All of them.
-He can never get them all.


1209
01:09:31.037 --> 01:09:32.038
Nebula: He will!

1210
01:09:32.121 --> 01:09:34.082
He can't, nebula.

1211
01:09:34.248 --> 01:09:36.584
Because I found the map
to the soul stone...


1212
01:09:36.751 --> 01:09:39.545
And I burned it to ash.
I burned it.


1213
01:09:44.592 --> 01:09:46.386
You're strong.

1214
01:09:48.429 --> 01:09:49.430
Me.

1215
01:09:52.016 --> 01:09:53.601
You're generous.

1216
01:09:54.936 --> 01:09:55.937
Me.

1217
01:09:57.939 --> 01:10:00.358
But I never taught you to lie.

1218
01:10:00.525 --> 01:10:03.152
That's why
you're So bad at it.


1219
01:10:05.363 --> 01:10:09.909
Where is the soul stone?

1220
01:10:14.497 --> 01:10:15.540
(Screaming)

1221
01:10:22.338 --> 01:10:23.673
(Continues screaming)

1222
01:10:27.301 --> 01:10:28.302
Vormir!

1223
01:10:31.514 --> 01:10:33.266
(Gasping weakly)

1224
01:10:46.446 --> 01:10:48.031
The stone is on vormir.

1225
01:10:51.325 --> 01:10:53.327
Show me.

1226
01:10:55.621 --> 01:10:56.956
Groot: I am groot.

1227
01:10:57.123 --> 01:10:58.249
Rocket: Tinkle in the cup.

1228
01:10:58.332 --> 01:10:59.667
We're not looking.
What's there to see?


1229
01:10:59.834 --> 01:11:02.003
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.


1230
01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:03.254
I am groot.

1231
01:11:03.421 --> 01:11:04.464
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1232
01:11:04.547 --> 01:11:06.049
out into space
and go in the cup again.


1233
01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.550
You speak groot?

1234
01:11:07.717 --> 01:11:09.510
Yes, they taught it on asgard.
It was an elective.


1235
01:11:09.677 --> 01:11:10.720
I am groot.

1236
01:11:10.887 --> 01:11:12.889
You'll know when we're close.

1237
01:11:13.056 --> 01:11:14.640
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1238
01:11:14.724 --> 01:11:16.934
the blazing power
of a neutron star.


1239
01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:21.773
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.


1240
01:11:22.482 --> 01:11:24.233
It's truly awesome.

1241
01:11:30.281 --> 01:11:33.409
Okay, time to be the captain.

1242
01:11:38.414 --> 01:11:39.957
So, dead brother, huh?

1243
01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:42.460
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1244
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.837
Well, he's been dead before.

1245
01:11:46.297 --> 01:11:48.841
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.


1246
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:51.636
And you said
your sister and your dad?


1247
01:11:51.803 --> 01:11:53.096
Both dead.

1248
01:11:53.721 --> 01:11:55.389
But still got a mom, though?

1249
01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:57.141
Killed by a dark elf.

1250
01:11:57.308 --> 01:11:58.309
A best friend?

1251
01:11:58.434 --> 01:11:59.769
Stabbed through the heart.

1252
01:12:03.147 --> 01:12:06.317
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?


1253
01:12:08.569 --> 01:12:10.029
Absolutely.

1254
01:12:10.196 --> 01:12:13.699
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...


1255
01:12:13.866 --> 01:12:15.451
They're all
tremendous motivators.


1256
01:12:15.535 --> 01:12:16.536
They really clear the mind.

1257
01:12:16.702 --> 01:12:18.329
So I'm good to go.

1258
01:12:18.996 --> 01:12:21.165
Yeah, but this thanos
we're talkin' about...


1259
01:12:21.624 --> 01:12:23.918
He's the toughest there is.

1260
01:12:24.085 --> 01:12:26.129
-Well, he's never fought me.
-Yeah, he has.


1261
01:12:26.295 --> 01:12:27.839
He's never fought me twice.

1262
01:12:28.464 --> 01:12:30.216
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.


1263
01:12:30.383 --> 01:12:32.635
It better be some hammer.

1264
01:12:33.761 --> 01:12:35.179
(Chuckling)

1265
01:12:36.764 --> 01:12:42.019
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1266
01:12:39.809 --> 01:12:41.853
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.


1267
01:12:42.019 --> 01:12:44.063
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,


1268
01:12:44.063 --> 01:12:45.064
But none succeeded.

1269
01:12:45.731 --> 01:12:48.651
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.


1270
01:12:48.818 --> 01:12:51.612
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...


1271
01:12:51.779 --> 01:12:53.656
And he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.


1272
01:12:53.823 --> 01:12:55.616
Fate wills it So.

1273
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.034
Mmm-hmm.

1274
01:12:57.118 --> 01:12:58.953
And what if you're wrong?

1275
01:13:02.248 --> 01:13:04.041
If I'm wrong, then...

1276
01:13:05.334 --> 01:13:06.878
What more could I lose?

1277
01:13:11.591 --> 01:13:12.633
(Sniffs)

1278
01:13:20.683 --> 01:13:22.059
I could lose a lot.

1279
01:13:22.143 --> 01:13:24.270
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.


1280
01:13:28.065 --> 01:13:29.066
Okay.

1281
01:13:30.484 --> 01:13:32.069
(Video game beeping)

1282
01:13:32.153 --> 01:13:34.238
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...


1283
01:13:34.405 --> 01:13:36.115
You're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.


1284
01:13:36.282 --> 01:13:38.284
-What's this?
-What's it look like?


1285
01:13:38.618 --> 01:13:41.037
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on contraxia.


1286
01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:42.455
He gave you his eye?

1287
01:13:42.622 --> 01:13:43.748
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1288
01:13:43.915 --> 01:13:46.876
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.


1289
01:13:48.794 --> 01:13:50.046
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1290
01:13:50.129 --> 01:13:51.130
Hmm.

1291
01:13:53.674 --> 01:13:55.176
Huh?

1292
01:13:55.676 --> 01:13:56.886
(Squelches)

1293
01:13:56.969 --> 01:13:58.012
Oh.

1294
01:13:58.346 --> 01:14:01.015
I would've washed that.
(Clears throat)


1295
01:14:01.098 --> 01:14:03.601
The only way I could sneak it
off contraxia was up my...


1296
01:14:03.684 --> 01:14:04.852
(Alarm beeps)

1297
01:14:04.936 --> 01:14:06.020
Hey, we're here!

1298
01:14:10.024 --> 01:14:11.150
I Don't think
this thing works.


1299
01:14:11.317 --> 01:14:12.485
Everything seems dark.

1300
01:14:14.946 --> 01:14:16.656
Rocket: It ain't the eye.

1301
01:14:30.002 --> 01:14:31.379
Something's wrong.

1302
01:14:32.171 --> 01:14:33.714
The star's gone out.

1303
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.133
And the rings are frozen.

1304
01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.739
Rocket: I hope
these dwarves are better


1305
01:14:58.823 --> 01:15:00.574
at forging
than they are cleaning.


1306
01:15:00.658 --> 01:15:02.243
(Video game beeping)

1307
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:07.415
Maybe they realised
that they live


1308
01:15:07.498 --> 01:15:08.916
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.


1309
01:15:09.083 --> 01:15:12.044
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.


1310
01:15:14.338 --> 01:15:16.966
You said thanos
had a gauntlet, right?


1311
01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:18.301
Thor: Yes, why?

1312
01:15:18.467 --> 01:15:20.511
Rocket: It look
anything like that?


1313
01:15:23.931 --> 01:15:25.683
I am groot.

1314
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:27.351
Go back to the pod.

1315
01:15:27.852 --> 01:15:28.853
(Grunts)

1316
01:15:31.355 --> 01:15:32.398
Eitri, wait!

1317
01:15:33.399 --> 01:15:34.400
Stop!

1318
01:15:35.318 --> 01:15:36.319
Stop.

1319
01:15:37.028 --> 01:15:38.029
Thor?

1320
01:15:41.365 --> 01:15:42.742
What happened here?

1321
01:15:43.159 --> 01:15:45.453
You were supposed
to protect us.


1322
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:48.998
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.


1323
01:15:49.165 --> 01:15:51.375
Asgard is destroyed.

1324
01:15:53.627 --> 01:15:57.465
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?


1325
01:16:00.634 --> 01:16:02.553
(Footsteps thudding)

1326
01:16:02.636 --> 01:16:04.180
(Video game beeping)

1327
01:16:06.265 --> 01:16:07.933
(Clanging)

1328
01:16:10.227 --> 01:16:13.230
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.


1329
01:16:14.607 --> 01:16:17.526
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.


1330
01:16:20.029 --> 01:16:21.489
I made what he wanted.

1331
01:16:23.199 --> 01:16:27.536
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.


1332
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:31.040
(Stammers)

1333
01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:34.668
Then he killed
everyone anyway.


1334
01:16:36.754 --> 01:16:38.547
All except me.

1335
01:16:39.632 --> 01:16:41.509
"Your life is yours," he said.

1336
01:16:42.802 --> 01:16:46.764
"But your hands
are mine alone."


1337
01:16:47.723 --> 01:16:49.725
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.


1338
01:16:50.851 --> 01:16:52.436
Every weapon
you've ever designed,


1339
01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.938
every axe, hammer, sword...

1340
01:16:54.105 --> 01:16:56.315
It's all inside your head.

1341
01:16:57.191 --> 01:16:59.110
Now, I Know it feels
like all hope is lost.


1342
01:16:59.276 --> 01:17:00.820
Trust me, I Know.

1343
01:17:01.278 --> 01:17:05.991
But together, you and I,
we can kill thanos.


1344
01:17:26.929 --> 01:17:28.347
(Grunting)

1345
01:17:36.856 --> 01:17:37.982
(Grunting)

1346
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:48.784
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1347
01:17:48.951 --> 01:17:51.162
I need you
to meet me on titan.


1348
01:17:57.710 --> 01:17:58.836
Spider-man:
Hey, what's going on?


1349
01:17:59.003 --> 01:18:00.212
Dr strange:
I think we're here.


1350
01:18:00.379 --> 01:18:02.840
I Don't think this rig has
a self-park function.


1351
01:18:04.592 --> 01:18:06.135
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.


1352
01:18:06.218 --> 01:18:07.261
Close those around it.

1353
01:18:08.929 --> 01:18:09.972
-You understand?
-Yep, got it.


1354
01:18:10.139 --> 01:18:11.432
This was meant for
one big guy, So we gotta


1355
01:18:11.515 --> 01:18:13.184
-move at the same time.
-Okay, okay. Ready.


1356
01:18:17.605 --> 01:18:18.814
-(Rumbling)
-We might wanna turn.


1357
01:18:18.981 --> 01:18:20.232
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1358
01:18:50.179 --> 01:18:51.680
You all right?

1359
01:18:52.723 --> 01:18:54.433
Stark: (Grunts)
That was close.


1360
01:18:55.809 --> 01:18:57.061
I owe you one.

1361
01:18:57.561 --> 01:18:59.647
Let me just say, if aliens

1362
01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:01.482
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...


1363
01:19:01.649 --> 01:19:02.775
And I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.


1364
01:19:02.942 --> 01:19:05.277
I do not want another
single pop culture reference


1365
01:19:05.361 --> 01:19:06.946
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?


1366
01:19:07.029 --> 01:19:08.489
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.


1367
01:19:15.913 --> 01:19:16.997
Drax: Thanos!

1368
01:19:17.998 --> 01:19:18.999
(Yelling)

1369
01:19:20.834 --> 01:19:21.877
(Grunting)

1370
01:19:28.842 --> 01:19:29.843
(Grunts)

1371
01:19:32.179 --> 01:19:33.389
(Peter laughs)

1372
01:19:36.267 --> 01:19:37.309
(Spider-man gasps)

1373
01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:39.812
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!


1374
01:19:39.895 --> 01:19:41.230
(Grunts)

1375
01:19:41.313 --> 01:19:43.774
-(Spider-man grunts)
-Peter quill: Stay down, clown.


1376
01:19:47.319 --> 01:19:48.904
(Screams)

1377
01:19:48.988 --> 01:19:51.073
Drax: Die, blanket of death!

1378
01:19:55.828 --> 01:19:56.912
(Grunts)

1379
01:19:56.996 --> 01:19:59.915
Peter: Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.


1380
01:20:01.125 --> 01:20:03.127
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.


1381
01:20:03.877 --> 01:20:05.129
Where is gamora?

1382
01:20:05.296 --> 01:20:07.798
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's gamora?


1383
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:10.884
I'll do you one better.
Why is gamora?


1384
01:20:11.051 --> 01:20:12.970
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you


1385
01:20:13.053 --> 01:20:14.305
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.


1386
01:20:14.471 --> 01:20:17.308
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!


1387
01:20:17.891 --> 01:20:20.477
Do it, quill! I can take it.

1388
01:20:20.644 --> 01:20:22.646
-No, he can't take it!
-She's right. You can't.


1389
01:20:22.813 --> 01:20:24.857
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.


1390
01:20:25.024 --> 01:20:26.066
I'll kill all three of you

1391
01:20:26.150 --> 01:20:27.985
and I'll beat it
out of thanos myself.


1392
01:20:28.152 --> 01:20:29.153
Starting with you.

1393
01:20:29.236 --> 01:20:30.321
Wait, what, thanos?

1394
01:20:30.404 --> 01:20:32.489
All right, let me ask you
this one time.


1395
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:34.658
What master do you serve?

1396
01:20:34.825 --> 01:20:36.076
What master do I serve?

1397
01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.620
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?


1398
01:20:38.579 --> 01:20:39.580
You're from earth.

1399
01:20:39.663 --> 01:20:40.706
I'm not from earth,
I'm from Missouri.


1400
01:20:40.789 --> 01:20:42.124
Stark: Yeah, that's on earth,
dipshit.


1401
01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:43.334
What are you hassling us for?

1402
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.252
Spider-man: So you're not
with thanos?


1403
01:20:45.753 --> 01:20:47.546
With thanos?

1404
01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:50.716
No, I'm here to kill thanos.

1405
01:20:50.883 --> 01:20:52.718
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?


1406
01:20:53.552 --> 01:20:55.262
-We're the avengers, man.
-Oh.


1407
01:20:55.346 --> 01:20:57.640
You're the ones
Thor told us about.


1408
01:20:57.806 --> 01:20:58.974
You know Thor?

1409
01:20:59.141 --> 01:21:00.225
Yeah.

1410
01:21:00.309 --> 01:21:02.770
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.


1411
01:21:02.936 --> 01:21:04.605
Where is he now?

1412
01:21:19.662 --> 01:21:22.915
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?


1413
01:21:21.705 --> 01:21:23.666
It's a mould.

1414
01:21:23.666 --> 01:21:24.667
A king's weapon.

1415
01:21:25.626 --> 01:21:27.961
Meant to be
the greatest in asgard.


1416
01:21:28.587 --> 01:21:31.465
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.


1417
01:21:31.632 --> 01:21:33.092
Did it have a name?

1418
01:21:34.343 --> 01:21:35.511
Storm breaker.

1419
01:21:35.969 --> 01:21:37.096
That's a bit much.

1420
01:21:39.139 --> 01:21:40.224
So how do we make it?

1421
01:21:42.059 --> 01:21:44.269
You'll have to restart
the forge.


1422
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:47.439
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.


1423
01:21:50.067 --> 01:21:52.695
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1424
01:21:56.365 --> 01:21:58.325
Peter: The hell happened
to this planet?


1425
01:21:58.492 --> 01:22:00.285
It's eight degrees
off its axis.


1426
01:22:00.369 --> 01:22:02.579
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.


1427
01:22:03.914 --> 01:22:06.709
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.


1428
01:22:07.668 --> 01:22:10.295
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.


1429
01:22:10.462 --> 01:22:11.714
Or at least
the beginnings of one.


1430
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.215
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,


1431
01:22:13.298 --> 01:22:14.508
pin him down,
get what we need.


1432
01:22:14.675 --> 01:22:16.343
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.


1433
01:22:16.427 --> 01:22:17.469
We just want the gauntlet.

1434
01:22:18.053 --> 01:22:20.431
-Are you yawning?
-(Yawning)


1435
01:22:20.514 --> 01:22:22.683
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?


1436
01:22:22.808 --> 01:22:23.809
Did you hear what I said?

1437
01:22:24.643 --> 01:22:26.895
I stopped listening after
you said, "we need a plan."


1438
01:22:27.062 --> 01:22:28.147
Okay, mr clean
is on his own page.


1439
01:22:28.313 --> 01:22:31.150
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.


1440
01:22:31.316 --> 01:22:32.818
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?


1441
01:22:32.985 --> 01:22:34.570
Kick names, take ass.

1442
01:22:34.737 --> 01:22:35.988
Yeah, that's right.

1443
01:22:40.909 --> 01:22:41.910
(Sighs)

1444
01:22:42.703 --> 01:22:44.037
All right, just get over here,
please.


1445
01:22:44.455 --> 01:22:46.373
Mr lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?


1446
01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.709
"Mr lord." Star-lord is fine.

1447
01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.713
Stark: We gotta coalesce.

1448
01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.506
"Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...


1449
01:22:54.673 --> 01:22:56.967
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1450
01:22:57.134 --> 01:22:58.302
We don't know what it means.

1451
01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:01.305
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.


1452
01:23:01.472 --> 01:23:03.932
Except it sucks,
So let me do the plan...


1453
01:23:04.099 --> 01:23:06.018
And that way
it might be really good.


1454
01:23:06.185 --> 01:23:08.145
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.


1455
01:23:08.312 --> 01:23:10.439
-Stark: What dance-off?
(Stammers) It's nothing.


1456
01:23:10.606 --> 01:23:11.648
Like in footloose, the movie?

1457
01:23:11.815 --> 01:23:13.192
Exactly like footloose.

1458
01:23:13.734 --> 01:23:15.235
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?


1459
01:23:15.402 --> 01:23:16.528
Spider-man: It never was.

1460
01:23:16.695 --> 01:23:17.738
Stark: Don't encourage this,
all right?


1461
01:23:17.821 --> 01:23:19.114
-Okay.
-We're getting no help


1462
01:23:19.198 --> 01:23:20.783
-from flash Gordon here.
-Flash Gordon?


1463
01:23:20.866 --> 01:23:21.992
By the way,
that's a compliment.


1464
01:23:22.576 --> 01:23:24.077
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1465
01:23:24.244 --> 01:23:26.997
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...


1466
01:23:26.997 --> 01:23:27.998
That's 100% you.

1467
01:23:28.165 --> 01:23:29.416
Stark: Your math
is blowing my mind.


1468
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.793
Mantis: Excuse me.

1469
01:23:31.794 --> 01:23:35.214
But does your friend
often do that?


1470
01:23:36.632 --> 01:23:38.926
Strange, we all right?

1471
01:23:46.558 --> 01:23:48.060
(Gasps)

1472
01:23:48.143 --> 01:23:49.144
(Panting)

1473
01:23:49.228 --> 01:23:50.270
You're back. You're all right.

1474
01:23:50.354 --> 01:23:52.147
-Dr strange: Hi.
-Hey, what was that?


1475
01:23:52.648 --> 01:23:56.318
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.


1476
01:23:57.194 --> 01:23:58.737
To see all
the possible outcomes


1477
01:23:58.821 --> 01:24:00.656
of the coming conflict.

1478
01:24:01.406 --> 01:24:02.741
How many did you see?

1479
01:24:02.908 --> 01:24:05.160
14,000,605.

1480
01:24:06.829 --> 01:24:08.247
How many did we win?

1481
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:14.169
One.

1482
01:24:36.066 --> 01:24:39.069
Thanos: The stone
had better be up there.


1483
01:24:40.946 --> 01:24:42.990
For your sister's sake.

1484
01:25:03.886 --> 01:25:08.640
Welcome, thanos, son of alars.

1485
01:25:10.726 --> 01:25:13.979
Gamora, daughter of thanos.

1486
01:25:14.146 --> 01:25:15.314
Thanos: You know us?

1487
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.027
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.


1488
01:25:20.527 --> 01:25:22.195
Where is the soul stone?

1489
01:25:22.905 --> 01:25:24.573
You should know...

1490
01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.368
It extracts a terrible price.

1491
01:25:29.703 --> 01:25:31.288
I am prepared.

1492
01:25:33.749 --> 01:25:36.168
We all think that at first.

1493
01:25:40.714 --> 01:25:43.008
We are all wrong.

1494
01:25:54.603 --> 01:25:56.939
Thanos: How is it you know
this place So Well?


1495
01:25:57.105 --> 01:26:01.443
A lifetime ago,
i, too, sought the stones.


1496
01:26:01.902 --> 01:26:04.613
I even held one in my hand.

1497
01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.825
But it cast me out,
banished me here.


1498
01:26:08.992 --> 01:26:13.038
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.


1499
01:26:21.755 --> 01:26:24.675
What you seek
lies in front of you.


1500
01:26:25.634 --> 01:26:27.761
As does what you fear.

1501
01:26:28.512 --> 01:26:29.972
What's this?

1502
01:26:30.472 --> 01:26:32.015
Red skull: The price.

1503
01:26:32.182 --> 01:26:36.812
Soul holds a special place
among the infinity stones.


1504
01:26:37.813 --> 01:26:41.900
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.


1505
01:26:43.276 --> 01:26:45.112
Thanos: Tell me what it needs.

1506
01:26:45.278 --> 01:26:48.824
Red skull: To ensure that
whoever possesses it...


1507
01:26:48.991 --> 01:26:51.535
Understands its power...

1508
01:26:52.494 --> 01:26:56.248
The stone demands a sacrifice.

1509
01:26:56.415 --> 01:26:57.958
Of what?

1510
01:26:58.375 --> 01:27:00.335
In order to take the stone,

1511
01:27:00.419 --> 01:27:02.838
you must lose
that which you love.


1512
01:27:05.757 --> 01:27:07.718
A soul...

1513
01:27:07.718 --> 01:27:08.969
For a soul.

1514
01:27:17.894 --> 01:27:19.479
(Laughing)

1515
01:27:24.693 --> 01:27:27.029
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...


1516
01:27:27.988 --> 01:27:29.364
A moment...

1517
01:27:30.699 --> 01:27:32.784
When you got
what you deserved.


1518
01:27:34.995 --> 01:27:37.289
And I was always
So disappointed.


1519
01:27:40.876 --> 01:27:42.335
But now...

1520
01:27:46.298 --> 01:27:49.384
You kill and torture...

1521
01:27:51.344 --> 01:27:53.346
And you call it mercy.

1522
01:27:57.434 --> 01:27:59.519
The universe has judged you.

1523
01:28:01.104 --> 01:28:05.567
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.


1524
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:08.612
You failed.

1525
01:28:09.988 --> 01:28:11.865
And do you wanna know why?

1526
01:28:12.824 --> 01:28:14.659
Because you love nothing.

1527
01:28:15.368 --> 01:28:16.995
No one.

1528
01:28:22.626 --> 01:28:23.794
No.

1529
01:28:28.423 --> 01:28:29.424
Really?

1530
01:28:30.467 --> 01:28:31.551
Tears?

1531
01:28:32.344 --> 01:28:34.304
They're not for him.

1532
01:28:48.568 --> 01:28:49.778
Gamora: No.

1533
01:28:51.279 --> 01:28:52.697
This isn't love.

1534
01:28:53.573 --> 01:28:56.243
I ignored my destiny once.

1535
01:28:58.703 --> 01:29:00.872
I cannot do that again.

1536
01:29:01.373 --> 01:29:04.751
Even for you.

1537
01:29:17.722 --> 01:29:18.849
(Clinks)

1538
01:29:23.854 --> 01:29:24.855
(Gasps)

1539
01:29:28.942 --> 01:29:31.319
I'm sorry, little one.

1540
01:29:35.157 --> 01:29:36.408
No!

1541
01:30:42.641 --> 01:30:43.808
(Gasps)

1542
01:31:14.005 --> 01:31:16.841
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1543
01:31:17.008 --> 01:31:18.260
I hope you're right
about this.


1544
01:31:18.426 --> 01:31:21.304
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.


1545
01:31:37.028 --> 01:31:38.405
When you said we were
going to open wakanda


1546
01:31:38.488 --> 01:31:39.531
to the rest of the world...

1547
01:31:39.739 --> 01:31:41.950
This is not what I imagined.

1548
01:31:42.117 --> 01:31:44.077
And what did you imagine?

1549
01:31:44.244 --> 01:31:45.370
The Olympics.

1550
01:31:45.537 --> 01:31:47.289
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1551
01:32:01.511 --> 01:32:02.887
Should we bow?

1552
01:32:03.054 --> 01:32:04.306
Yeah, he's a king.

1553
01:32:04.639 --> 01:32:06.641
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.


1554
01:32:07.809 --> 01:32:09.936
-(Clears throat)
-What are you doing?


1555
01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:12.022
Uh, we don't do that here.

1556
01:32:12.188 --> 01:32:14.441
So how big of an assault
should we expect?


1557
01:32:14.607 --> 01:32:17.610
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.


1558
01:32:17.777 --> 01:32:18.778
How we looking?

1559
01:32:18.862 --> 01:32:20.822
You will have my kingsguard,

1560
01:32:20.905 --> 01:32:23.867
the border tribe,
the dora milaje, and...


1561
01:32:24.826 --> 01:32:27.746
And a semi-stable

1562
01:32:30.623 --> 01:32:31.791
How you been, buck?

1563
01:32:31.958 --> 01:32:35.086
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.


1564
01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.183
Banner: Whoa.

1565
01:32:48.266 --> 01:32:50.352
The structure is polymorphic.

1566
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:53.688
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.


1567
01:32:54.105 --> 01:32:55.940
Why didn't you just reprogramme

1568
01:32:56.024 --> 01:32:58.151
the synapses
to work collectively?


1569
01:32:59.235 --> 01:33:02.489
Because we didn't think of it.

1570
01:33:02.906 --> 01:33:04.199
I'm sure you did your best.

1571
01:33:04.366 --> 01:33:05.575
Can you do it?

1572
01:33:06.493 --> 01:33:09.788
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.


1573
01:33:09.954 --> 01:33:13.124
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.


1574
01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:14.584
It will take time, brother.

1575
01:33:16.294 --> 01:33:17.337
How long?

1576
01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:18.630
As long as you can give me.

1577
01:33:18.713 --> 01:33:20.715
-(Kimoyo beads trilling)
-(Alarm beeping)


1578
01:33:23.301 --> 01:33:25.512
Something's entered
the atmosphere.


1579
01:33:42.362 --> 01:33:44.656
Hey, cap, we got
a situation here.


1580
01:33:54.165 --> 01:33:56.000
God, I love this place.

1581
01:33:56.167 --> 01:33:57.794
War machine: (On radio) Yeah,
don't start celebrating yet, guys.


1582
01:33:57.877 --> 01:33:59.796
We got more incoming
outside the dome.


1583
01:34:19.023 --> 01:34:20.108
Vision: It's too late.

1584
01:34:21.151 --> 01:34:22.402
We need to destroy
the stone now.


1585
01:34:22.986 --> 01:34:24.612
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.


1586
01:34:24.779 --> 01:34:26.114
We will hold them off.

1587
01:34:26.281 --> 01:34:29.701
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...


1588
01:34:29.868 --> 01:34:30.869
You blow it to hell.

1589
01:34:31.286 --> 01:34:32.370
I will.

1590
01:34:32.537 --> 01:34:35.331
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defences.


1591
01:34:36.082 --> 01:34:37.542
And get this man a shield.

1592
01:34:47.969 --> 01:34:49.053
Rocket: (On radio)
I Don't think


1593
01:34:49.137 --> 01:34:50.263
you get the scientifics here.

1594
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:52.891
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...


1595
01:34:53.057 --> 01:34:54.434
You're gonna need something
a lot bigger


1596
01:34:54.517 --> 01:34:55.560
to yank 'em loose.

1597
01:34:55.727 --> 01:34:57.770
-Leave that to me.
-Leave it to you?


1598
01:34:57.937 --> 01:35:01.065
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...


1599
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:02.775
-(Yelps)
(Grunting)


1600
01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.029
(Rocket yelling)

1601

I can't heat the metal.

01:36:35.076 --> 01:36:36.369
How long will it take
to heat it?


1616
01:36:36.828 --> 01:36:39.205
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?


1617
01:36:41.207 --> 01:36:42.250
I'm gonna hold it open.

1618

of the mystic arts.

he brought you?

Let me guess. Your home?

1723
01:47:00.201 --> 01:47:01.493
It was.

1724
01:47:04.246 --> 01:47:05.664
And it was beautiful.

1725
01:47:08.292 --> 01:47:10.753
Titan was like most planets.

1726
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:13.797
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.


1727
01:47:13.964 --> 01:47:17.218
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.


1728
01:47:18.219 --> 01:47:19.428
Genocide.

1729
01:47:20.137 --> 01:47:25.559
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.


1730
01:47:25.559 --> 01:47:27.728
They called me a madman.

1731
01:47:28.437 --> 01:47:30.689
And what I predicted
came to pass.


1732

Congratulations,
you're a prophet.

With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.


1736
01:47:43.994 --> 01:47:53.629
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.


1737
01:47:50.793 --> 01:47:52.294
And then what?

1738
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:55.130
I'd finally rest...

1739
01:47:55.923 --> 01:47:59.051
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.


1740

the strongest wills.

equal to yours.

(Grunting)

1766
01:50:04.176 --> 01:50:05.302
Where's gamora?

1767
01:50:05.386 --> 01:50:06.512
(Grunts)

1768

1774
01:50:46.635 --> 01:50:47.678
Iron man: Is he under?
Don't let up.


1775
01:50:47.845 --> 01:50:50.472
Be quick. He is very strong.

1776
01:50:50.639 --> 01:50:52.683
Parker, help! Get over here.

1777
01:50:52.850 --> 01:50:55.185
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.


1778
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:01.650
Spider-man: We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.


1779
01:51:01.817 --> 01:51:02.943
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.


1780
01:51:03.026 --> 01:51:04.236
For the record,
this was my plan.


1781
01:51:05.571 --> 01:51:07.281
You're not So strong now, huh?

1782
01:51:07.781 --> 01:51:09.533
Where is gamora?

1783
01:51:09.616 --> 01:51:11.577
(Groaning) My gamora.

1784

Peter: No, bullshit!

1785
01:51:14.079 --> 01:51:15.372
Where is she?

1786
01:51:16.457 --> 01:51:17.749

1787
01:51:18.459 --> 01:51:20.461
-Good.
-(Groaning)


1788
01:51:20.544 --> 01:51:22.880
(Panting) He... he mourns.

1789
01:51:23.422 --> 01:51:27.050
Drax: (Straining) What does
this monster have to mourn?


1790
01:51:27.759 --> 01:51:28.844
Nebula: Gamora.

1791
01:51:32.723 --> 01:51:33.724
What?

1792
01:51:34.141 --> 01:51:35.642
He took her to vormir.

1793
01:51:36.268 --> 01:51:38.228
He came back
with the soul stone.


1794
01:51:39.021 --> 01:51:45.611
But she didn't.

1795
01:51:42.441 --> 01:51:46.487
Okay, quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?


1796
01:51:46.487 --> 01:51:49.948
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!


1797
01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.201
Tell me she's lying.

1798
01:51:54.661 --> 01:51:57.456
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!


1799
01:51:58.916 --> 01:52:02.336
I had to.

1800
01:52:03.086 --> 01:52:04.505
No, you didn't.

Come on! Get some!

1817
01:53:31.633 --> 01:53:33.677
-How much for the gun?
-Not for sale.


1818
01:53:34.303 --> 01:53:36.179
Okay. How much for the arm?

1819
01:53:38.056 --> 01:53:40.058
On, I'll get that arm.

By the way, this is
a friend of mine, tree.


1826

I am groot.

Black panther:
Fall back! Fall back, now!


1831
01:54:32.944 --> 01:54:34.655
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.

Why was she up there
all this time?


1837
01:55:02.849 --> 01:55:05.727
She's on the field. Take it.

This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.


1854

This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the hulk.

I Know you like making your

No tricks.

1928
02:02:29.671 --> 02:02:30.672
Don't.

1929
02:02:47.438 --> 02:02:48.606
(Sighs)

1930
02:03:22.098 --> 02:03:23.808
One to go.

1931
02:03:24.767 --> 02:03:25.977
(Peter screams)

1932
02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:31.065
(Grunting)

1933
02:03:31.858 --> 02:03:32.984
(Coughs)

1934
02:03:33.693 --> 02:03:35.111
Where is he?

1935
02:03:39.616 --> 02:03:41.034
(Panting)

1936
02:03:44.078 --> 02:03:45.455
Did we just lose?

1937
02:03:49.375 --> 02:03:51.294
Why would you do that?

1938
02:03:54.631 --> 02:03:56.883
We're in the endgame now.

1939
02:03:58.551 --> 02:04:00.511
(Yelling)

1940
02:04:02.972 --> 02:04:05.600
(Warriors chanting in xhosa)

1941
02:04:21.658 --> 02:04:28.039
(Panting) Are you okay?

1942
02:04:24.369 --> 02:04:26.162
-(High-pitched ringing)
-(Groans)


1943
02:04:26.246 --> 02:04:27.956
What? What is it?

1944
02:04:28.039 --> 02:04:30.124
(Breathing heavily)

1945
02:04:30.124 --> 02:04:31.251
He's here.

1946
02:04:33.544 --> 02:04:35.546
(Wind howling)

1947
02:04:42.262 --> 02:04:45.306
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.


1948
02:04:48.059 --> 02:04:50.019
What the hell?

1949
02:05:15.545 --> 02:05:16.546
Banner: Cap.

1950
02:05:17.297 --> 02:05:18.756
That's him.

1951
02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:23.386
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1952
02:05:47.869 --> 02:05:48.870
Wanda.

1953
02:05:49.996 --> 02:05:51.289
It's time.

1954
02:05:51.456 --> 02:05:52.457
No.

1955
02:05:52.623 --> 02:05:54.834
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.


1956
02:05:55.001 --> 02:05:56.419
Look at me.

1957
02:05:56.586 --> 02:05:57.754
You have the power
to destroy the stone.


1958
02:05:57.837 --> 02:05:58.838
Don't.

1959
02:05:58.921 --> 02:06:00.048
You must do it. 
Wanda, please.

1960
02:06:02.050 --> 02:06:04.635
We are out of time.

1961
02:06:05.428 --> 02:06:06.554
I can't.

1962
02:06:06.721 --> 02:06:08.139
Yes, you can.

1963
02:06:08.806 --> 02:06:10.058
You can.

1964
02:06:11.559 --> 02:06:13.853
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.


1965
02:06:16.230 --> 02:06:17.732
It's not fair.

1966
02:06:18.941 --> 02:06:20.526
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.


1967
02:06:22.487 --> 02:06:23.946
It's all right.

1968
02:06:25.365 --> 02:06:27.075
You could never hurt me.

1969
02:06:36.125 --> 02:06:37.919
I just feel you.

1970
02:07:46.446 --> 02:07:48.072
(Yelling)

1971
02:08:01.043 --> 02:08:02.170
It's all right.

1972
02:08:12.096 --> 02:08:13.431
It's all right.

1973
02:08:17.768 --> 02:08:18.853
I love you.

1974
02:08:33.659 --> 02:08:35.703
(Panting)

1975
02:08:48.174 --> 02:08:50.301
I understand, my child.

1976
02:08:51.844 --> 02:08:53.471
Better than anyone.

1977
02:08:55.139 --> 02:08:57.058
You could never.

1978
02:09:01.896 --> 02:09:04.899
Today, I lost more
than you can know.


1979
02:09:06.692 --> 02:09:09.320
But now is no time to mourn.

1980
02:09:11.572 --> 02:09:15.576
Now is no time at all.

1981
02:09:38.891 --> 02:09:39.892
No!

1982
02:09:44.230 --> 02:09:45.231
(Choking)

1983
02:10:10.089 --> 02:10:11.340
(Screams)

1984
02:10:21.475 --> 02:10:22.476
(Grunts)

1985
02:10:36.157 --> 02:10:37.783
(Panting)

1986
02:10:37.867 --> 02:10:39.327
I told you...

1987
02:10:40.745 --> 02:10:42.538
You'd die for that.

1988
02:10:43.664 --> 02:10:48.711
(Screams)

1989
02:10:48.711 --> 02:10:49.879
(Groans)

1990
02:10:52.131 --> 02:10:54.133
(Laboured breathing)

1991
02:10:56.886 --> 02:10:58.638
(Weakly) You should have...

1992
02:11:01.265 --> 02:11:02.725
You should...

1993
02:11:05.227 --> 02:11:08.481
You should have
gone for the head.


1994
02:11:10.399 --> 02:11:11.400
No!

1995
02:11:44.809 --> 02:11:46.018
Daughter?

1996
02:11:53.651 --> 02:11:55.027
Did you do it?

1997
02:11:56.946 --> 02:11:57.947
Yes.

1998
02:12:06.372 --> 02:12:07.957
What did it cost?

1999
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:13.170
Everything.

2000
02:12:23.431 --> 02:12:24.974
What did you do?

2001
02:12:26.225 --> 02:12:27.727
What'd you do?

2002
02:12:36.819 --> 02:12:38.529
(Panting)

2003
02:12:41.365 --> 02:12:42.742
Where'd he go?

2004
02:12:45.661 --> 02:12:46.662
Thor.

2005
02:12:46.871 --> 02:12:48.414
(Panting)

2006
02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:51.667
Where'd he go?

2007
02:12:51.834 --> 02:12:53.085
Bucky: Steve?

2008
02:13:16.525 --> 02:13:18.527
(All speaking xhosa)

2009
02:13:18.611 --> 02:13:20.237
(All groaning)

2010
02:13:27.912 --> 02:13:30.206
Up, general. Up!

2011
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:32.208
This is no place to die.

2012
02:13:32.291 --> 02:13:33.834
(Groans)

2013
02:13:44.637 --> 02:13:45.805
(Speaks xhosa)

2014
02:13:47.264 --> 02:13:48.849
(Weakly) I am groot.

2015
02:13:48.933 --> 02:13:50.476
-(Okoye shouts in xhosa)
-Rocket: Oh...


2016
02:13:51.352 --> 02:13:53.437
No, no, no!

2017
02:13:54.271 --> 02:13:57.107
Groot! No.

2018
02:14:06.158 --> 02:14:07.368
(Groans)

2019
02:14:10.538 --> 02:14:11.705
Sam!

2020
02:14:13.123 --> 02:14:15.668
(Whimpering)

2021
02:14:15.751 --> 02:14:17.378
Sam, where you at?

2022
02:14:18.504 --> 02:14:19.505
(Thunder rumbling)

2023
02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:28.931
Something's happening.

2024
02:14:36.063 --> 02:14:38.065
(Panting)

2025
02:14:41.068 --> 02:14:42.236
Quill?

2026
02:14:49.618 --> 02:14:50.786
Steady, quill.

2027
02:14:50.953 --> 02:14:52.079
Oh, man.

2028
02:14:56.250 --> 02:14:57.251
Dr strange: Tony.

2029
02:15:00.796 --> 02:15:03.257
There was no other way.

2030
02:15:08.929 --> 02:15:09.930
Spider-man: Mr stark?

2031
02:15:14.393 --> 02:15:15.728
I Don't feel So good.

2032
02:15:17.813 --> 02:15:18.814
You're all right.

2033
02:15:18.898 --> 02:15:19.982
I Don't... I Don't know
what's happening.


2034
02:15:20.065 --> 02:15:21.609
I Don't know... (Groans)

2035
02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:24.445
I Don't want to go.

2036
02:15:24.528 --> 02:15:26.238
I Don't want to go, sir.
Please.


2037
02:15:26.405 --> 02:15:29.116
Please, I Don't want to go.
I Don't want to go.


2038
02:15:33.662 --> 02:15:35.164
(Softly) I'm sorry.

2039
02:15:50.012 --> 02:15:51.472
He did it.

2040
02:16:07.237 --> 02:16:09.239
(Panting)

2041
02:16:16.246 --> 02:16:19.458
What is this?
What the hell is happening?


2042
02:16:36.350 --> 02:16:38.102
Oh, god.

2043
02:17:17.683 --> 02:17:19.184
(Sighs deeply)

2044
02:27:34.382 --> 02:27:35.717
Fury: Still no word
from stark?


2045
02:27:35.884 --> 02:27:37.135
Hill: No, not yet.

2046
02:27:37.302 --> 02:27:38.595
We're watching every satellite

2047
02:27:38.678 --> 02:27:40.555
on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.


2048
02:27:40.639 --> 02:27:42.599
-(Beeping)
_fury: What is it?


2049
02:27:42.766 --> 02:27:45.101
Hill: Multiple bogeys
over wakanda.


2050
02:27:45.268 --> 02:27:47.187
Fury: Same energy signature
as New York?


2051
02:27:47.354 --> 02:27:48.688
Hill: Ten times bigger.

2052
02:27:50.190 --> 02:27:51.316
Fury: Tell klein
we'll meet him at...


2053
02:27:51.399 --> 02:27:52.442
-Hill: Nick! Nick!
(Tyres screech)


2054
02:27:52.525 --> 02:27:53.818
(Crashes)

2055
02:28:06.081 --> 02:28:07.374
Fury: They okay?

2056
02:28:08.375 --> 02:28:10.126
There's no one here.

2057
02:28:10.210 --> 02:28:12.212
(Helicopter blades whirring)

2058
02:28:18.385 --> 02:28:19.594
(People screaming)

2059
02:28:19.678 --> 02:28:21.179
Call control.

2060
02:28:21.930 --> 02:28:23.223
Code red.

2061
02:28:23.890 --> 02:28:24.891
Nick.

2062
02:28:26.559 --> 02:28:27.560
Fury: Hill.

2063
02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:38.655
(Siren wailing in distance)

2064
02:28:41.157 --> 02:28:42.158
(Pager beeps)

2065
02:28:42.492 --> 02:28:43.660
Oh, no.

2066
02:28:45.286 --> 02:28:46.287
Mother...

2067
02:28:52.877 --> 02:28:54.337
(Beeping)
