1
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.810
Ally, can we get recap?

2
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:43.994
You remember the Kowolskis.

3
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.389
They've owned this shop for 30 years,
and they are attempting to set a record


4
00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:51.708
by making Buffalo's largest cookie.
And you have to wear this.


5
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.210
- A hair net?
- Health department.


6
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.836
- You're kidding me.
- If you're working around the cookie,


7
00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:56.214
you have to have it on.
It's the law.


8
00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:59.426
I just did the hair.
The hair is perfect.


9
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.889
All right. Give it to me.

10
00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:07.209
God, why do you hate me?

11
00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:09.753
We're rolling. And speed.

12
00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:12.964
For three decades,
the Kowolski family bakery


13
00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.801
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo,


14
00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:19.888
known for their sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski Pierogis,


15
00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:23.767
and the occasional sugar-induced
coma that follows.


16
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.728
But today, in honor of
their 30th anniversary,


17
00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:31.233
they've invited us to ride along
as they go for the record


18
00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:33.902
on Buffalo's biggest cookie.

19
00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:40.325
Vol. Vol. You need a
tissue or something?


20
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.036
Can we get Vol a tissue
or a spoon?


21
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:44.871
It's a good thing
we're wearing these today,


22
00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:46.456
'cause I wouldn't want
any stray hairs


23
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:48.458
to fall into the booger.

24
00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:51.336
Are we gonna do this again?
No. We can cut to B-roll.


25
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:57.509
Moving on! So tell me, Mama. Why
make Buffalo's biggest cookie?


26
00:01:57.593 --> 00:02:00.804
Well, man from health department

27
00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:06.351
say he find rat pellet in our
pastry, but I say, "No."


28
00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:12.149
ls big chocolate sprinkle.
But he shut store down.


29
00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:16.361
So we clean up, make big cookie

30
00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:20.198
for to bring customers back.

31
00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:24.327
Well, I admire your candor.
Let's try that again, shall we?


32
00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:29.207
So tell me, Mama. Why make
Buffalo's biggest cookie?


33
00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:33.628
So the children of the
neighborhood will be happy?


34
00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:38.592
That's right. It must be wonderful
seeing the smiles on their little faces.


35
00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:41.136
I work in back.
I see no smiles.


36
00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:47.100
The previous Buffalo record
was eight feet, seven inches,


37
00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:48.643
baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

38
00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:51.813
If this cookie beats Gladys's,
it will prove once and for all


39
00:02:51.898 --> 00:02:54.274
that the Kowolskis
have much more free time.


40
00:02:54.358 --> 00:02:57.986
And the cookie is 10 feet,
four inches.


41
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.989
We have a new record!

42
00:03:01.073 --> 00:03:04.534
Cue the cheesy
inspirational music!


43
00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:24.471
But what are we
really looking at here?


44
00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:29.518
Is it just a big cookie, or does this
cookie represent the pride of Buffalo,


45
00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:33.355
its dedicated and hardworking
citizens the key ingredient,


46
00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.191
with a few nuts thrown in,

47
00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:41.112
and, finally, the love of our families,
which provides the warm, chewy center,


48
00:03:41.197 --> 00:03:45.617
making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.


49
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:48.578
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.


50
00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:53.625
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.
And cut it.


51
00:03:55.628 --> 00:03:57.546
What do you think?

52
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.090
I think it's really good.
It sucks.


53
00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:01.925
It's a story about a cookie.

54
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.719
The Pillsbury Doughboy
will be riveted.


55
00:04:05.304 --> 00:04:07.722
Honey, it was funny.
It made me laugh.


56
00:04:07.807 --> 00:04:09.724
There's nothing wrong
with making people laugh.


57
00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.977
I'll never be an anchorman,
not with this.


58
00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:13.781
The job's right there,
but I can't reach it,


59
00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:15.855
because every time
they make me do this stuff,


60
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.817
I have to act like a total
goof in order to make it work.


61
00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:22.362
I have no credibility.
Not good. Not good.


62
00:04:22.446 --> 00:04:23.863
You know what? Now you're
just sounding silly.


63
00:04:23.948 --> 00:04:24.948
Know what? Forget it.

64
00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:27.576
It's not important, right?
It's not important.


65
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.452
Let's watch it one more time.
Oh, no.


66
00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:31.663
Just once more. Please?
No. No.


67
00:04:31.747 --> 00:04:35.333
Bruce, you promised you
would help with this album.


68
00:04:35.418 --> 00:04:37.794
Now, you get
your goofy butt over here.


69
00:04:39.672 --> 00:04:40.672
Uh-uh.

70
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:43.341
Okay.

71
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.346
Okay. Okay. Now, you just
go through this stack,


72
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.515
and you pick your favorites.

73
00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.772
Oh, come on. This is fun.
Right? Isn't this fun?


74
00:04:57.857 --> 00:04:59.190
This is nice.

75
00:05:00.192 --> 00:05:02.112
Evan's gonna get that
anchor job, I just know it.


76
00:05:02.194 --> 00:05:03.820
Ah, Bruce!
He's the favorite.


77
00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:06.384
All right. You know what? Just forget it.
Let's just forget it.


78
00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:10.785
This is just our life. We can always
just have some kid do it for us.


79
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:16.458
Whoa! Hold the phone! I like this one.
Our weekend at the lake.


80
00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:19.102
How did you get that? That's
supposed to be in our private stash.


81
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:22.297
You look perky, hon. It must've been cold.
All right. Just give it to me.


82
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:23.781
I think I'll put this
on my computer


83
00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:25.091
and use it as wallpaper.
No, no, no.


84
00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:27.302
Okay. Give it to me. Come on!
No, no, no.


85
00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:31.389
All right. Fine. Do with it what you will.
I don't care.


86
00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:34.100
I will do with it what I will.
Jesus.


87
00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:38.563
You know, I might even
send this in to Playboy.


88
00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:42.442
I hear their layouts can be quite tasteful.
Give that to me right now!


89
00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:43.610
Jesus.
Right now!


90
00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:45.987
Rough stuff!
I'm gonna hurt you...


91
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.328
Sweetie? Time to get up.

92
00:05:56.082 --> 00:05:58.792
Good dream. No. No.

93
00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:12.305
Well, the Buffalo Sabres lost again last night
at the hands of the Toronto Maple Leafs.


94
00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:15.475
It was a shootout on the ice for our home...
Of course. They're my team.


95
00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.727
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.


96
00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:20.689
You know, I think there might be
something to this cookie line.


97
00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:23.900
All the greatest anchors have had
their own signature sign-off,


98
00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:26.528
like Wal-ter Cron-kite.

99
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.743
And that's the way it was. That's
the way the cookie crumbles.


100
00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:37.622
And that's the way...
l like it...


101
00:06:40.084 --> 00:06:42.544
Oh, no. Grace, the dog!

102
00:06:42.628 --> 00:06:44.254
I'm in the shower!

103
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.719
No, Sam! Bad dog!

104
00:06:50.803 --> 00:06:55.348
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

105
00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:02.647
Oh, you're done now. Great.

106
00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:06.443
B
-E
-A-utiful.

107
00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:10.739
Come on. Let's go back
inside and have a shit.


108
00:07:16.162 --> 00:07:19.664
What is the deal-io?
We are having a blood drive.


109
00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:21.791
Creepy. Needles. Yuck.

110
00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:24.836
Well, they need my blood.
I have a very rare blood type.


111
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.255
I'm AB positive.
Really?


112
00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:28.673
I'm IB positive.

113
00:07:28.758 --> 00:07:32.927
I be positive, they ain't touching
me with no needle. It's just so...


114
00:07:33.012 --> 00:07:36.556
Helpful and lifesaving? No.
It's your blood. It's blood.


115
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.517
Blood's supposed to stay inside the body.
That's where it's meant to be.


116
00:07:39.602 --> 00:07:42.187
Besides, they stockpile this
stuff in a warehouse somewhere.


117
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:45.023
It's all frozen on ice, and they
tell everybody there's a shortage.


118
00:07:45.107 --> 00:07:47.484
That's just not true.
Where did you hear that?


119
00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:50.069
From a very reliable
friend of a friend of a girl,


120
00:07:50.154 --> 00:07:53.156
whose sister's going out with someone
very high up in the government.


121
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.680
But for your own protection, I
cannot discuss it at this time.


122
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.327
Now, get out
before they see us together.


123
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:58.620
Oh, no.

124
00:08:01.707 --> 00:08:05.168
Oh. Here. Hold on a second.
You need these more than I do.


125
00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:07.545
What is these?
Prayer beads.


126
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.549
The kids made them for me.
They will keep you safe.


127
00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:12.967
I hope they're powerful.

128
00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:16.554
I'm gonna need a frigging
miracle to get to work on time.


129
00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:31.069
This isn't happening. Not now.
Not during sweeps week.


130
00:08:31.153 --> 00:08:33.988
Not during sweeps week!

131
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:36.908
Oh, God.

132
00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:40.578
Yeah. Yeah.
Meeting's started without me.


133
00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:43.706
This is my luck.
This is my luck!


134
00:08:46.043 --> 00:08:47.544
Shit.

135
00:08:49.713 --> 00:08:52.173
Oh, come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on!


136
00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:59.764
Jesus. Get out of there!

137
00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:07.772
"R Ewe Blind."
No, but I'm late.


138
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.527
Is your child in dire jeopardy?

139
00:09:12.611 --> 00:09:14.362
Find out tonight after the game.

140
00:09:14.446 --> 00:09:15.905
Okay. Promos are approved.

141
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.490
Now, let's...
Uh, Jack,


142
00:09:17.575 --> 00:09:19.826
shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement?


143
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.110
I mean, this is his last week.

144
00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:23.621
Yeah, Jack. Any word on
the open anchor position?


145
00:09:23.706 --> 00:09:26.749
Evan, when I know something,
you'll know something.


146
00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:30.503
Sorry I'm late. 
Traffic was...

147
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.424
Did you guys already play the spots?
It's a nice story, Bruce,


148
00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:36.384
but we're gonna go
with Evan's piece,


149
00:09:36.468 --> 00:09:39.679
sex scandal in the mayor's
office for sweeps.


150
00:09:39.763 --> 00:09:42.974
Oh, yeah. Sweeps.

151
00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:47.270
And that's the way
the cookie crumbles.


152
00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:50.565
I'm just messing with you, Bruce.

153
00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:57.071
See, you just got to remember that
the newsroom is like a big cookie.


154
00:09:58.824 --> 00:10:00.950
Do you like jazz, Evan?
Yeah.


155
00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:02.660
Let me play something for you.

156
00:10:09.835 --> 00:10:12.921
I can hold that note all day, buddy.
Knock it off, guys.


157
00:10:13.005 --> 00:10:15.173
Bruce, we're gonna
keep your story in reserve.


158
00:10:15.257 --> 00:10:16.674
Now, can we get back to the board,

159
00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:19.469
so we'll have something
to put on the air today?


160
00:10:19.762 --> 00:10:22.847
Great choice, Jack. This is
the Cadillac of bolognas.


161
00:10:22.932 --> 00:10:25.475
Okay. Thanks. Jack, can
I talk to you a second?


162
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.102
Yeah. Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
Sweeps.


163
00:10:28.187 --> 00:10:30.772
Bruce. Jack. Jack!
Hear me out here.


164
00:10:30.856 --> 00:10:32.231
I'm starting
to get desperate, man.


165
00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:34.692
I'm pushing 40, and what
have I got to show for it?


166
00:10:34.777 --> 00:10:36.444
I've hit some kind
of a ceiling here.


167
00:10:36.528 --> 00:10:39.113
There's an anti-Bruce barrier
I can't get past.


168
00:10:39.198 --> 00:10:42.492
And Evan is loving it,
by the way. Loving it.


169
00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:46.496
He gets the stories. He gets on sweeps.
Maybe I should be more like Evan.


170
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.040
You don't wanna be like Evan.
Evan's an asshole.


171
00:10:49.124 --> 00:10:51.960
I can be an asshole.
No, Bruce. You can't.


172
00:10:56.882 --> 00:10:59.717
You gonna pick that up? Yeah. I'm sorry.
It's... I'm losing it.


173
00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:03.304
It's just this whole anchor thing
opening up has got me nuts.


174
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:04.389
Hi, Susan.

175
00:11:04.473 --> 00:11:06.265
Hi, Susan.
Hi, Jack.


176
00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:10.979
Look, Bruce. You're a good reporter.
You make people laugh.


177
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:18.111
All right. I'll tell
you what. Today is the

178
00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:20.196
I want you at Niagara Falls
in an hour.


179
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.991
Maid of the Mist?
That's always live.


180
00:11:24.076 --> 00:11:25.660
But Evan always does live feeds.

181
00:11:25.744 --> 00:11:28.538
Now you and Evan
get the live feeds.


182
00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:32.041
I'm going live? During sweeps?
But watch your step, Bruce.


183
00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:36.337
I've seen your outtakes. Jack,
you will not regret this.


184
00:11:36.422 --> 00:11:40.133
And I won't forget you when I go national.
Uh, can you...


185
00:11:41.593 --> 00:11:43.052
Thanks, pal.

186
00:11:44.138 --> 00:11:47.890
Can I have your wish now? I'm gonna
put it in the wish jar. Thank you.


187
00:11:47.975 --> 00:11:50.184
Okay. Put your wish in there.
Me too.


188
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:54.105
Put your wish in there. Look at that.
Looks like a big wish.


189
00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:57.316
Oh, no, no. Oh, no. Martin, don't...
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.


190
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.486
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey.


191
00:12:02.281 --> 00:12:06.034
That must've tasted awful.
Mommy!


192
00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:10.038
Oh, Zoe-Baboey! Did you have a
good time with Aunt Crazy today?


193
00:12:10.122 --> 00:12:13.708
Yeah? See how nice this is?
Baby on the hip?


194
00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:15.585
Oh, it's amazing.
You've become Mom.


195
00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:18.212
The transformation is complete.

196
00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:20.757
Oh.
I'll get it.


197
00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:22.550
- Small Wonders Day Care.
- Grace?


198
00:12:22.634 --> 00:12:25.136
No. It's Debbie, the sister
whose life you're not wasting.


199
00:12:25.262 --> 00:12:28.222
Oh, all right. Okay, okay, okay.
Bye, Debbie!


200
00:12:28.307 --> 00:12:33.227
Hi. Hi. Sorry. Debbie forgot to
take her meds today. Where are you?


201
00:12:33.312 --> 00:12:38.316
Oh, a little place called the winner's circle.
I'm at the falls doing a live report.


202
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.569
Live? That's great!
Yeah! It's happening, hon.


203
00:12:41.653 --> 00:12:43.362
I got sweeps, and I'm live.

204
00:12:43.447 --> 00:12:45.948
You know what that means? They're
seeing if I can think on my feet,


205
00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:48.868
you know, like, I might have to do
in a live news anchor situation.


206
00:12:48.952 --> 00:12:50.495
Oh, my gosh.

207
00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:52.997
Yeah. It's what we've
always talked about, Grace.


208
00:12:53.082 --> 00:12:55.917
Jack practically came out and told me.
Practically?


209
00:12:56.001 --> 00:12:58.711
Well, he didn't spell it out,
but legally, he can't.


210
00:12:58.796 --> 00:13:00.588
But this is exactly
what happened to Susan Ortega


211
00:13:00.672 --> 00:13:03.382
just before they bumped her up.

212
00:13:03.467 --> 00:13:05.551
It's good. It's good.
It's good.


213
00:13:05.636 --> 00:13:07.762
Okay. Well, honey,
I just don't...


214
00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:09.972
I don't want you
to get too ahead of yourself.


215
00:13:10.099 --> 00:13:12.433
Bruce? Oh, I got to go.
They're calling me in.


216
00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:14.602
Oh. Okay, honey.
Good luck. I love you.


217
00:13:14.686 --> 00:13:16.687
Love, love, love, love, love.

218
00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:18.981
Let's do it.

219
00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:22.235
They want you close to the falls.
Really?


220
00:13:22.319 --> 00:13:24.112
I'm gonna get soaked.
That's the point.


221
00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:25.780
They want you to put this on.

222
00:13:25.864 --> 00:13:28.699
Part of the condition of us
getting the exclusive.


223
00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:32.787
You know what? Nothing can
bother me today. Nothing.


224
00:13:32.871 --> 00:13:36.833
Okay. Now, remember. It's their

225
00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:38.960
149 capacity.
Right.


226
00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:42.672
They cater to tourists, honeymooners...
And people insanely thirsty.


227
00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:43.798
I get it.
Okay.


228
00:13:43.882 --> 00:13:46.634
And you are gonna be
interviewing lrene Dansfield.


229
00:13:46.718 --> 00:13:49.595
Irene! Pleasure to meet you.
Truly.


230
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:52.765
You look beautiful. Irene's
mother rode on the maiden voyage.


231
00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:55.143
Wow. Rub that in my face, why don't you?
Ninety seconds!


232
00:13:55.227 --> 00:13:59.063
Ninety seconds? Holy hell.
Uh, yeah. Okay. 90 seconds?


233
00:13:59.398 --> 00:14:04.527
Because of the fast response, the toxic
chemicals were cleaned up without incident.


234
00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:07.655
Susan? Bruce Nolan is
standing by at Niagara Falls,


235
00:14:07.739 --> 00:14:10.741
but before we go live to Bruce,
we have an announcement to make.


236
00:14:11.243 --> 00:14:16.497
As everyone knows, after 33 years, our
beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.


237
00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:21.919
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible
to fill, but the show must go on,


238
00:14:22.004 --> 00:14:27.383
and we could think of no one better
than our very own Evan Baxter.


239
00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:30.887
Oh... Oh, boy.

240
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.182
Congratulations, Evan. Thanks, Susan.
I'm thrilled and honored.


241
00:14:34.266 --> 00:14:35.266
And as you said,

242
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.020
no one can replace the great Pete
Fineman, but I will do my best.


243
00:14:39.104 --> 00:14:43.733
I have to say, I am so proud to be a
part of our local community of Buffalo,


244
00:14:43.817 --> 00:14:48.905
and I think, in a lot of ways, a great
city is like a great recipe, really.


245
00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:54.535
You take hardworking citizens, add
some caregivers, maybe a few nuts,


246
00:14:57.789 --> 00:15:01.584
all sprinkled with the love and
support of our good families.


247
00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:05.880
Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.


248
00:15:05.964 --> 00:15:07.715
That was amazing.
I meant it.


249
00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:10.384
I wish I'd written something.
And now let's go live


250
00:15:10.469 --> 00:15:13.137
to that wacky Bruce Nolan
out at Niagara Falls.


251
00:15:13.222 --> 00:15:14.847
Hey! Wacky Bruce!

252
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.187
Bruce? Talk, Bruce. Hello?

253
00:15:21.271 --> 00:15:23.272
Talk, honey. Talk.
What's going on?


254
00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:25.274
We got a Walt Disney.
He's frozen solid.


255
00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:27.068
We may not have audio.
Check the feed.


256
00:15:27.152 --> 00:15:29.487
We may be having a bit
of technical difficulty.


257
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:30.571
Feed's good, Jack.

258
00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:33.616
Move. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Talk, Bruce, damn it!


259
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.452
All right. Get ready to pull the plug.
Come on, baby. Say something.


260
00:15:36.536 --> 00:15:39.997
Say something.
Bruce, talk.


261
00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:44.794
Hi, Susan.
Oh, thank you, God.


262
00:15:44.878 --> 00:15:47.171
Bruce Nolan here
aboard the Maid of the Mist


263
00:15:47.256 --> 00:15:49.840
in fabulous Niagara Falls,
New York.


264
00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:54.762
First off, let me just add another
congratulations to Evan Backstabber...


265
00:15:54.846 --> 00:15:57.139
Pardon me. Bastard.
Baxter, rather.


266
00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:00.017
It is good to see what
someone with talent can do,


267
00:16:00.102 --> 00:16:03.187
when great opportunities are
given to them instead of me.


268
00:16:04.606 --> 00:16:08.693
Anyway, I'm here with Katharine
Hepburn's mom. Tell me.


269
00:16:08.777 --> 00:16:11.028
Why did you throw the blue
Heart of the Ocean jewel


270
00:16:11.113 --> 00:16:13.322
over the railing of the Titanic?

271
00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:15.700
Did you feel bad at all
letting Leo DiCaprio drown,


272
00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:18.411
while you were safe,
floating on the door?


273
00:16:18.495 --> 00:16:19.996
Could you have taken turns,

274
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.499
or were you just too afraid to
freeze your big, fat ass off?


275
00:16:24.543 --> 00:16:26.294
I guess that's how life is,
isn't it?


276
00:16:26.378 --> 00:16:31.173
Some people are drenched, freezing to death
on a stupid boat, with a stupid hat,


277
00:16:31.258 --> 00:16:34.635
while others are in a comfy news
studio, sucking up all the glory.


278
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.139
- Oh, well. No big deal.
- Oh, boy.


279
00:16:38.223 --> 00:16:40.308
Oh, look. It's the owner
of the Maid of the Mist.


280
00:16:40.392 --> 00:16:42.393
Let's have a talk with him, shall we?
Come on in here, Bill.


281
00:16:42.477 --> 00:16:43.686
That's all right.
No, no, no, no. No, no.


282
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.979
Come on. Let's have a talk.

283
00:16:45.063 --> 00:16:46.981
Come on. What are you doing?

284
00:16:47.065 --> 00:16:49.859
Bill, you've been running the Maid
of the Mist for 23 years now.


285
00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:52.063
Tell me. Why do you think
I didn't get the anchor job?


286
00:16:52.154 --> 00:16:54.947
Hey, man. I don't want problems.
Is it my hair, Bill?


287
00:16:55.032 --> 00:16:56.490
Are my teeth not white enough?

288
00:16:56.575 --> 00:17:03.497
Or like the great falls, is the bedrock
of my life eroding beneath me?


289
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:09.086
Eroding! Eroding! Eroding!

290
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.797
Cut the feed. Go to black.

291
00:17:11.882 --> 00:17:13.132
Go to black.
I'm on it.


292
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.763
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News.
Back to you, fuckers!


293
00:17:20.182 --> 00:17:22.016
Oh, boy.
Oh, my God.


294
00:17:27.105 --> 00:17:31.942
That is perfect. That is the
motivation that I needed!


295
00:17:32.027 --> 00:17:34.445
Right there! Thank you.

296
00:17:35.447 --> 00:17:38.574
Thank you, W. K. B. W.!

297
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.453
Wimpy Kitty Baby Whiners!

298
00:17:42.537 --> 00:17:44.663
That's what that stands for!

299
00:17:46.083 --> 00:17:50.294
I'll see you on Channel 5,
where they do the real news.


300
00:17:51.588 --> 00:17:54.632
Do I look blind to you?
Do I look blind to you?


301
00:17:55.592 --> 00:17:59.220
Hey. Let's go, man. Come on.
Let's go.


302
00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:04.600
What are you doing over there? Come on.
Leave the poor guy alone.


303
00:18:05.435 --> 00:18:06.894
You okay, man?

304
00:18:08.855 --> 00:18:10.898
Yeah, you'd better keep walking.

305
00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:13.067
What? What'd you say, ése?

306
00:18:13.151 --> 00:18:15.736
Run, man! Run!

307
00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:19.281
Oh, God!

308
00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:25.454
Okay, okay, okay! I didn't mean it!
I was just kidding!


309
00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:27.498
Hey, you forgot your things.

310
00:18:32.087 --> 00:18:34.463
Say something to that.
Say something.


311
00:18:37.509 --> 00:18:43.764
B
-E
-A-utiful.

312
00:18:47.602 --> 00:18:50.229
That's what I get...

313
00:18:50.313 --> 00:18:53.607
That's what I get
for trying to help someone.


314
00:18:55.444 --> 00:18:57.987
Oh, don't look at me, Walter.

315
00:18:58.071 --> 00:18:59.822
Oh, no!

316
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:09.165
Well, that's my payment, I guess.
That... That is my reward.


317
00:19:14.045 --> 00:19:17.173
Just? Just get a clue!

318
00:19:18.508 --> 00:19:20.217
Thank God you're all right.

319
00:19:20.302 --> 00:19:22.803
God. Yeah.
Let's thank God. Shall we?


320
00:19:22.888 --> 00:19:25.347
For his blessings
are raining down upon me.


321
00:19:25.474 --> 00:19:28.476
Wait! That's not rain! Bruce,
please don't do that, honey.


322
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.145
You know that everything
happens for a reason.


323
00:19:31.229 --> 00:19:34.815
That I don't need. That is a cliché.
That is not helpful to me.


324
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.942
A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.


325
00:19:37.027 --> 00:19:40.321
I have no bird. I have no bush. God
has taken my bird and my bush.


326
00:19:40.405 --> 00:19:43.616
Oh, I see. So God is picking on
you, is that what you're saying?


327
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.994
No. He's ignoring me
completely.


328
00:19:47.078 --> 00:19:50.498
He's far too busy giving
Evan everything he wants.


329
00:19:50.582 --> 00:19:54.084
Oh, that's great, Sam, but you
missed your target. I'm over here!


330
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:56.545
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not the dog's fault.


331
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.298
No. It's God's fault. I gave
him the wrong coordinates.


332
00:19:59.382 --> 00:20:00.716
All right. You know what?
Enough. All right?


333
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.426
Will you stop being such a martyr?

334
00:20:02.511 --> 00:20:05.095
I am not being a martyr.
I'm a victim.


335
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.931
God is a mean kid
sitting on an anthill


336
00:20:07.015 --> 00:20:09.099
with a magnifying glass,
and I'm the ant.


337
00:20:09.184 --> 00:20:11.393
He could fix my life in five
minutes if he wanted to,


338
00:20:11.478 --> 00:20:14.480
but he'd rather burn off my
feelers and watch me squirm!


339
00:20:14.564 --> 00:20:17.358
Sweetheart, I know you're mad.
It's understandable.


340
00:20:17.442 --> 00:20:23.197
What Evan did is slimy and wrong, but
this day could've been so much worse.


341
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:27.993
I'm just glad you're okay. Okay?
News flash! I'm not okay.


342
00:20:28.078 --> 00:20:31.539
I'm not okay with a mediocre job! I'm
not okay with a mediocre apartment.


343
00:20:31.623 --> 00:20:34.458
I'm not okay with a mediocre life!

344
00:20:42.676 --> 00:20:46.136
So is that what you think that we have?
A mediocre life?


345
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:49.473
Don't make this about you.
About me?


346
00:20:49.558 --> 00:20:54.812
How could I make this about me? It's
about you! It's always about you!


347
00:20:54.896 --> 00:20:57.523
Perfect. Perfect.

348
00:20:57.607 --> 00:20:59.567
I'll have the worst day of my life

349
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:02.236
with a side order of guilt,
please!


350
00:21:05.115 --> 00:21:06.156
Oh.

351
00:21:07.576 --> 00:21:11.412
Okay, God.
You want me to talk to you?


352
00:21:11.496 --> 00:21:14.707
Then talk back.
Tell me what's going on.


353
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:17.668
What should I do?
Give me a signal.


354
00:21:19.588 --> 00:21:23.882
Oh, I need your guidance, Lord.
Please send me a sign.


355
00:21:28.013 --> 00:21:30.431
Ah, what's this joker doing now?

356
00:21:36.062 --> 00:21:39.565
Okay. All right.
I'll try it your way.


357
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:44.737
All right.
Lord, I need a miracle.


358
00:21:45.864 --> 00:21:49.450
I'm desperate.
I need your help, Lord.


359
00:21:49.534 --> 00:21:53.454
Please reach into my life.
Hey!


360
00:21:54.873 --> 00:21:58.792
What the he... I got you!

361
00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:26.236
Hey!

362
00:22:42.754 --> 00:22:46.090
Fine! The gloves are off, pal!

363
00:22:46.174 --> 00:22:48.676
Come on!
Let me see a little wrath.


364
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.429
Smite me, O mighty smiter!

365
00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:55.974
You're the one
who should be fired!


366
00:22:56.059 --> 00:23:00.729
The only one around here
not doing his job is you!


367
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:03.941
Answer me!

368
00:23:18.707 --> 00:23:20.874
Sorry. Don't know you.

369
00:23:21.793 --> 00:23:23.877
Wouldn't call you if I did.

370
00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:29.049
Oh.

371
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:39.143
Oh, God. Oh.

372
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.651
Hello, "5550123."

373
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:16.472
Oh, no! Sam,
this has got to stop.


374
00:24:19.058 --> 00:24:20.642
All right.
Now, get it straight here.


375
00:24:20.727 --> 00:24:23.771
That's the house. This is the bathroom.
House. Bathroom.


376
00:24:23.855 --> 00:24:26.940
Bathroom. House. House. Bathroom.
Bathroom. House.


377
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.944
What's the point?

378
00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.555
"5550123"

379
00:25:00.934 --> 00:25:03.977
Denied that promotion at work?
Is life unfair?


380
00:25:04.062 --> 00:25:07.105
Is there someone less talented
than you reaping all the benefits?


381
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.276
Is your name Bruce? Then do
we have the job for you.


382
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:14.655
We're located at 77256 23rd Street.

383
00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:18.325
So come on down, or we'll
just keep beeping you.


384
00:25:35.385 --> 00:25:37.010
"Omni Presents."

385
00:25:38.221 --> 00:25:41.306
Oh, yeah.
The glass is half full.


386
00:25:41.766 --> 00:25:43.100
Oh, geez!

387
00:25:45.061 --> 00:25:50.315
Come on! Look!
What is that? What is that?


388
00:25:51.776 --> 00:25:55.112
Ah, geez! Thank you.
Thank you again.


389
00:26:02.954 --> 00:26:04.371
What the...

390
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.131
You're looking for Room 7.

391
00:26:16.801 --> 00:26:18.719
Yeah. I figured.

392
00:26:18.803 --> 00:26:21.013
You want me
to even those up for you?


393
00:26:24.642 --> 00:26:26.226
How do I get to Room 7?

394
00:26:26.311 --> 00:26:29.897
That'll be on the seventh floor.
Stairs are right over there.


395
00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:32.357
I'd rather take the elevator.
Out of order.


396
00:26:32.442 --> 00:26:35.569
I love the stairs though.
They were my second choice.


397
00:26:35.653 --> 00:26:38.071
Do you mind giving me a hand
with this floor?


398
00:26:38.156 --> 00:26:41.074
What? That's good.

399
00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:43.827
Are you serious?

400
00:26:43.912 --> 00:26:47.205
Oh, I'm kind of busy.

401
00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:51.335
Um, rain check.
I'll hold you to it.


402
00:26:52.587 --> 00:26:55.756
I'm free on the seventh
at 7:00.


403
00:26:58.468 --> 00:27:00.302
Seventh at 7:00 it is.

404
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.432
This looks promising.

405
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:17.486
Hello? Another "hugantic,
ginormic" waste of my life.


406
00:27:18.196 --> 00:27:19.446
Hello?

407
00:27:21.282 --> 00:27:24.743
Yo! I'm looking for whoever runs
this joint. Be right with you.


408
00:27:24.827 --> 00:27:28.455
I'm trying to fix a light.
Tell me if it's working.


409
00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:30.791
Yeah. Seems to be.

410
00:27:30.875 --> 00:27:34.753
Kind of bright, though.
Yeah. It is for most people.


411
00:27:34.837 --> 00:27:39.091
Spend their lives in the dark
trying to hide from me.


412
00:27:40.802 --> 00:27:42.970
Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?

413
00:27:43.054 --> 00:27:45.973
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

414
00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:51.103
You install the Clapper? No,
but catchy jingle, isn't it?


415
00:27:51.896 --> 00:27:56.400
Clap on, clap off.
Clap on, clap off the Clapper.


416
00:27:57.735 --> 00:27:59.903
Just can't get it out of my head.

417
00:28:00.613 --> 00:28:04.157
Good luck with that.
I'm gonna go now.


418
00:28:04.242 --> 00:28:07.077
Okay. But the boss'll be
right out.


419
00:28:15.003 --> 00:28:19.381
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.


420
00:28:21.801 --> 00:28:23.427
This is hilarious.

421
00:28:23.511 --> 00:28:26.263
So you're the boss and the
electrician and the janitor?


422
00:28:26.347 --> 00:28:29.516
Must be a killer Christmas party.
Don't get drunk, though.


423
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.476
One of you might need a ride home.

424
00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:37.566
You always were funny, Bruce,
just like your father.


425
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.360
He didn't mind rolling up
his sleeves, either, son.


426
00:28:40.445 --> 00:28:43.905
People underestimate the benefit
of good old manual labor.


427
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.034
There's freedom in it. Some of
the happiest people in the world


428
00:28:47.118 --> 00:28:50.746
go home smelling to high
heaven at the end of the day.


429
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.873
All right. What is this?

430
00:28:52.957 --> 00:28:55.625
How do you know my father, and
how did you get my pager number?


431
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.420
Oh, I know quite a lot
about you, Bruce,


432
00:28:59.672 --> 00:29:02.299
just about everything
there is to know.


433
00:29:02.633 --> 00:29:07.345
Everything you've ever said or
done or thought about doing,


434
00:29:08.598 --> 00:29:10.807
right there in that file cabinet.

435
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.437
Wow. A whole drawer just for me.
Yeah.


436
00:29:15.521 --> 00:29:19.483
Mind if I take a look?
It's your life.


437
00:29:20.818 --> 00:29:22.652
This ought to be good.

438
00:29:37.335 --> 00:29:40.003
Now, this last entry
was a little disturbing.


439
00:29:51.766 --> 00:29:53.850
"The gloves are off, God.

440
00:29:53.976 --> 00:29:56.561
"God has taken my bird
and my bush.


441
00:29:56.646 --> 00:29:59.981
"God is a mean kid
with a magnifying glass.


442
00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:03.568
"Smite me, O mighty smiter!"

443
00:30:03.653 --> 00:30:07.864
Now, I'm not much for blaspheming,
but that last one made me laugh.


444
00:30:07.949 --> 00:30:09.825
Are you spying on me?

445
00:30:13.371 --> 00:30:14.788
Who are you?

446
00:30:15.957 --> 00:30:17.541
I'm the one.

447
00:30:18.126 --> 00:30:21.795
Creator of the heavens and
the earth, alpha and omega.


448
00:30:22.839 --> 00:30:25.132
Oh, I see where this is going.

449
00:30:25.216 --> 00:30:28.176
Bruce, I'm God.

450
00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:31.429
Bingo! Yahtzee!
Is that your final answer?


451
00:30:31.514 --> 00:30:36.143
Our survey says, "God!"
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing!


452
00:30:36.227 --> 00:30:37.936
Well, it was
nice to meet you, God.


453
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.396
Thank you for the Grand Canyon,

454
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.565
and good luck with the apocalypse.

455
00:30:41.649 --> 00:30:44.901
Oh, and by the way, you suck!

456
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.487
You know what would've been a
little more impressive, though?


457
00:30:47.572 --> 00:30:51.032
If you hadn't used the cheesy
file cabinet illusion.


458
00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:52.826
Anybody with a brain stem
can tell that


459
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.829
that drawer is being fed through
the wall from the other side.


460
00:30:55.913 --> 00:30:59.416
All you have to do is find the
crease, right around here.


461
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.170
There is a seam here
or a hollow spot.


462
00:31:07.592 --> 00:31:11.511
Where? Through the drywall
and concrete?


463
00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:17.767
Okay. That is a good one.
That is a good one.


464
00:31:18.477 --> 00:31:21.354
Okay. How many fingers am I holding up?
Now, Bruce.


465
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.440
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord... Hey,
if you can't do it, man, that's cool.


466
00:31:24.442 --> 00:31:29.279
Three. Two. Four.
Nine. Six. Eight. One.


467
00:31:31.407 --> 00:31:32.699
Okay.

468
00:31:33.826 --> 00:31:36.578
How many now?
Seven.


469
00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:45.837
You've been doing a lot of
complaining about me, Bruce.


470
00:31:45.963 --> 00:31:49.090
And quite frankly, I'm tired of it.
Wait. Don't come near me.


471
00:31:49.175 --> 00:31:51.009
When I'm backed into a corner,
I'm like a wild animal.


472
00:31:51.093 --> 00:31:52.552
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I will, out of instinct.


473
00:31:52.637 --> 00:31:56.264
You haven't won a fight since grade
five, and that was against a girl.


474
00:31:57.683 --> 00:32:00.727
Yeah, but she was huge.
She had been held back.


475
00:32:00.811 --> 00:32:05.065
And the sun was in your eyes.
Oh, there you go.


476
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:07.692
In a way, I brought you here
to offer you a job.


477
00:32:07.777 --> 00:32:10.028
Job? What job?
My job.


478
00:32:10.655 --> 00:32:13.865
You think you can do it better,
so here's your chance.


479
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:18.411
When you leave this building, you
will be endowed with all my powers.


480
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.373
Whatever you say, pal.

481
00:32:23.918 --> 00:32:28.213
Okay. That did not happen, and
no one needs to hear about it.


482
00:32:28.297 --> 00:32:30.006
I'm deleting the program.

483
00:32:32.093 --> 00:32:35.637
No. No. I'm having a
breakdown, that's what it is.


484
00:32:35.721 --> 00:32:40.267
Normal, everyday psychotic episode
caused by a tumor or brain lesion.


485
00:32:40.351 --> 00:32:42.102
Come on. Start!

486
00:32:44.021 --> 00:32:45.021
That was lucky.

487
00:32:51.195 --> 00:32:52.904
Come on, man. Calm down.

488
00:32:52.989 --> 00:32:56.574
You did not meet God,
you do not have his powers.


489
00:32:56.701 --> 00:32:59.286
If that was God,
then I'm Clint Eastwood.


490
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.829
Holy hell!

491
00:33:07.128 --> 00:33:10.338
Be careful
what you wish for, punk.


492
00:33:10.423 --> 00:33:13.008
No. No. No.

493
00:33:13.092 --> 00:33:18.972
I am a reasonable, sane human
being with a .44 Magnum,


494
00:33:19.056 --> 00:33:21.850
the most powerful handgun
in the wo...


495
00:33:22.476 --> 00:33:25.562
I'm not Clint Eastwood.
I'm Bruce Nolan.


496
00:33:25.646 --> 00:33:28.648
Bruce Nolan. I'm Bruce No-lan!

497
00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.748
Oh, it's not real.
It's not real.


498
00:33:47.209 --> 00:33:49.919
Coffee?
Yeah. Uh, coffee. Yeah.


499
00:33:50.046 --> 00:33:53.673
We have a special on soup today.
No. That's fine. Thank you.


500
00:33:53.758 --> 00:33:56.176
It's tomato. I made it myself.

501
00:33:57.511 --> 00:33:59.095
Okay.
Okay.


502
00:34:33.631 --> 00:34:35.965
Excuse me. I need a sp...

503
00:34:42.807 --> 00:34:44.474
it's okay. I found one.

504
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:53.733
Here's your soup.

505
00:34:53.818 --> 00:34:57.028
Oh, soup. Right.
Uh, yeah. Right.


506
00:35:47.538 --> 00:35:48.955
Having fun?

507
00:35:51.792 --> 00:35:56.588
Thy... Thou... Come. Take
a closer walk with me.


508
00:35:57.965 --> 00:36:00.341
Let me explain the rules.
Rules?


509
00:36:00.426 --> 00:36:04.012
Yeah. You left in such a rush, I
didn't get a chance to explain.


510
00:36:05.473 --> 00:36:08.641
Two extra fingers
freaked me out a little bit.


511
00:36:08.726 --> 00:36:11.060
I just figured
I'd get your attention.


512
00:36:11.145 --> 00:36:14.105
I did the same thing to Gandhi,
he didn't eat for three weeks.


513
00:36:15.733 --> 00:36:17.484
Anyway, here's the deal.

514
00:36:17.568 --> 00:36:20.528
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.


515
00:36:20.613 --> 00:36:23.948
There are only two rules. You
can't tell anybody you're God.


516
00:36:24.033 --> 00:36:26.326
Believe me, you don't want
that kind of attention.


517
00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.411
And you can't mess with free will.

518
00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:37.086
Can I ask why? Yes, you can!
That's the beauty of it!


519
00:36:44.762 --> 00:36:48.431
This is amazing. Speaking of amazing.
Excuse me.


520
00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:50.141
Oh.

521
00:36:52.436 --> 00:36:55.480
Holy sh... Cow.

522
00:36:56.106 --> 00:36:59.359
Since you're through with
these, I think I'll keep them.


523
00:36:59.443 --> 00:37:01.528
Might come in handy someday.

524
00:37:02.613 --> 00:37:04.280
See you around, kid.

525
00:37:05.366 --> 00:37:08.868
Where you going?
I'm taking a vacation.


526
00:37:08.953 --> 00:37:12.997
God doesn't take vacations,
does he? Do... ye?


527
00:37:13.082 --> 00:37:16.793
Did you ever hear of the Dark Ages?
Besides, I'm covered.


528
00:37:16.877 --> 00:37:20.922
You can clear everything up in five
minutes if you want to, right?


529
00:37:22.841 --> 00:37:24.050
Ciao.

Yo, brethren, what up with thee?
Blessings on your alley.

You didn't get enough, Mr. Hero?
He wants some more.

Surely I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.


545
00:39:05.527 --> 00:39:09.489
So as soon as you apologize and make a
full reckoning of your transgressions,


546
00:39:09.573 --> 00:39:13.826
I shall absolve you and continue
along the path of righteousness.


547

What are you talking about, man?

548
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.165

funny, you know what I mean?

I don't know if you've lost it all up in
here or what, but check this out, homie.


550
00:39:22.628 --> 00:39:24.796
You want me and the homies
to apologize, right?


551
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.839
Cool. Tell you what.

552
00:39:26.924 --> 00:39:29.044
We'll apologize the day a
monkey comes out of my butt.


553
00:39:29.093 --> 00:39:31.302
Then you get your "sorry."
How about that?


554
00:39:34.014 --> 00:39:37.308
What a coincidence,
because that's today.

Hey, don't forget
your parting gifts!

Don't rush yourself.

602

Oh, God! Oh!

604

610
00:44:36.692 --> 00:44:40.820
In international news, Japanese relief
workers are staging a desperate effort


611
00:44:40.904 --> 00:44:46.450
to rescue hundreds of people stranded by a
freak tidal wave that hit Kitamoto City.


612
00:44:46.535 --> 00:44:49.286
Scientists say the tsunami
may have been caused


613
00:44:49.371 --> 00:44:53.290
by what they're describing
as unusual lunar activity.


614
00:44:53.375 --> 00:44:55.418
More on this as it develops.

Honey, last night was just...
Heavenly? I know. I know.


626
00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:13.746
I mean, I woke up this morning,

627
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:16.290
and I felt like
my boobs were bigger.


628
00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:20.961
I mean, do they look bigger to you?
Uh, what? Your... No.


629
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:26.675
Bigger?
Oh, come on! Look at them!


630
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.597
Please. They are definitely bigger.
I mean, look. They feel huge.

Buffalo's number-one
police dog on the job.

This is Phil Sidleman reporting from
the Police Canine Training Center,

00:47:51.344 --> 00:47:53.012
Channel 5 News.

646
00:47:53.096 --> 00:47:54.263
And cut it.

Hey! Hey!
Look what the cat coughed up!


648
00:48:02.606 --> 00:48:03.772
Channel 7, right?

649
00:48:03.815 --> 00:48:06.567
You're the guy that went crazy?
I had a bad moment.


650
00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:09.695
What are you doing here?
Just looking for a story.


651
00:48:09.779 --> 00:48:13.324
There's no story here.
This pond is all fished out.


652
00:48:13.992 --> 00:48:17.036
Pretty standard stuff anyway.
I don't know.


653
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.246
My instinct tells me
there's something more.


654
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:22.458
Yeah? Well, go with that. It served
you well in the past, right?


655
00:48:30.508 --> 00:48:33.969
Hey! Hank found something!

656
00:48:34.054 --> 00:48:36.680
- Hey, we got a body!
- Over here!


657
00:48:37.515 --> 00:48:39.975
Get the camera! Now!

658
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.727
It's locked,
and the keys are inside!


659
00:48:41.811 --> 00:48:44.271
I guess every dog has his day.

660
00:48:44.356 --> 00:48:46.690
Hey, kid. You wanna make 10 bucks?
Sure.


661
00:48:46.775 --> 00:48:48.150
You know how to use one of these?

662
00:48:48.235 --> 00:48:49.276
Duh.

663
00:48:51.321 --> 00:48:53.906
Seems to be in tune.
Let's do this.


664
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:56.951
The body of Jimmy Hoffa
was uncovered in a field today


665
00:48:57.035 --> 00:49:00.120
outside of a canine training
center in Buffalo, New York.


666
00:49:00.497 --> 00:49:03.832
Bruce Nolan was the first on the scene.
Thank you, Jane.


667
00:49:03.917 --> 00:49:07.253
As you can see behind us, the
body is being carefully exhumed,


668
00:49:07.337 --> 00:49:09.338
and will be transported
to a medical facility,


669
00:49:09.422 --> 00:49:12.049
where DNA testing
can confirm the identity.


670
00:49:12.133 --> 00:49:14.802
That, however, merely a
formality at this point,


671
00:49:14.886 --> 00:49:18.430
as in a bizarre twist, the body was
found buried with a birth certificate


672
00:49:18.515 --> 00:49:20.766
and complete set
of dental records.


673
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.271
I'd call that a red-letter day for any K-9
unit, but was that enough for old Hank here?


674
00:49:25.355 --> 00:49:29.775
No, sirree. Moments later, he
busted a local news camera crew


675
00:49:29.859 --> 00:49:33.028
with 220 pounds of marijuana.

676
00:49:33.113 --> 00:49:36.156
I never saw it before, I swear!

677
00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:44.039
I'm Bruce Nolan, and that's
the way the cookie crumbles.


678
00:49:48.003 --> 00:49:50.212
Yeah! Did you like that?

679
00:49:52.632 --> 00:49:55.175
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

680
00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.428
Hi, Bruce.
Oh, hi, Susan.


681
00:49:57.512 --> 00:49:59.763
Good work. I'm impressed.

682
00:50:04.227 --> 00:50:07.104
Jack, did you need me for something?
Bruce! Bruce!


683
00:50:07.188 --> 00:50:09.064
Just the man I wanna see.
Hey.


684
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:13.527
Hoffa? What are the odds of that?
What are the odds of that?


685
00:50:13.611 --> 00:50:15.904
Bruce, why don't you sit down?
Okay.


686
00:50:15.989 --> 00:50:19.658
I'm gonna be straight with you.
We want you back, Bruce.


687
00:50:19.743 --> 00:50:23.871
But I want you to understand it was
not my decision to let you go.


688
00:50:23.955 --> 00:50:25.622
When the big guy
gives the order, you got to...


689
00:50:25.707 --> 00:50:27.166
No harm, no foul, Jack.

690
00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:28.834
I needed some time
to reassess my goals


691
00:50:28.918 --> 00:50:30.544
and get in touch
with my true self.


692
00:50:30.587 --> 00:50:33.714
You did that in a day? Imagine
what I could do with seven.


693
00:50:35.133 --> 00:50:38.093
Look, Bruce. It is not in my
power to give you anchor.


694
00:50:38.178 --> 00:50:41.138
Now, as far as field reporting goes,
if you're looking for a bump...


695
00:50:41.222 --> 00:50:44.767
Jack, let's just cut the crap and
get down to brass tacks here.


696
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:49.521
I'm kidding with you, and you...

697
00:50:49.606 --> 00:50:54.610
I had you going, Jackie. Don't
even worry about it, old friend.


698
00:50:54.694 --> 00:50:57.863
You just give me a camera,
Jack, I'll give you the news.

jalapeños marinate in a spicy sauce


702
00:51:12.462 --> 00:51:16.507
for at least 24 hours before

Was this Bruce's idea?

718
00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:16.859
He said he wanted me to have a day
of beauty and luxurious serenity.


719
00:52:18.194 --> 00:52:21.530
I got to tell you. He is
really impressing me lately.

00:52:21.614 --> 00:52:23.991
You know where he's taking me
to dinner tonight?


721
00:52:25.034 --> 00:52:26.368
Where?

722
00:52:28.788 --> 00:52:30.372
The Blue Palm?

723
00:52:32.208 --> 00:52:35.085
Oh, my gosh. I just got chills.
I know.


724
00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:39.214
And he told me to prepare for the most
memorable night of our entire lives.


725
00:52:39.299 --> 00:52:42.301
Oh, my gosh.
Grace, he's gonna propose.


726
00:52:42.385 --> 00:52:44.761
Stop it. No. Really?

727
00:52:44.846 --> 00:52:48.307
Yeah. Really. Come on.
You do the math.


728

He sends you all day

00:53:39.943 --> 00:53:41.777
Somebody get him some water.

744
00:53:41.861 --> 00:53:44.696
Looks like my new co-anchor
may need a glass of water.


745
00:53:48.952 --> 00:53:51.828
Oh. There we go.
Sorry about that.


746
00:53:51.913 --> 00:53:55.207
In other news,
the prime minister of Sweden


747
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:56.792
visited Washington today,

748
00:53:56.876 --> 00:53:59.795
and my tiny little nipples
went to France.


749
00:54:01.047 --> 00:54:03.882
What did he just say?
Check the prompter.


750
00:54:06.761 --> 00:54:09.721
The prompter's fine.
Evan, read the copy, please.


751
00:54:09.806 --> 00:54:12.140
The copy's good. Just read it.

752
00:54:12.225 --> 00:54:15.644
The White House reception committee
greeted the prime rib roast minister,


753
00:54:15.728 --> 00:54:19.439
and I do the cha-cha
like a sissy girl.


754
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:25.529
I "lika" do the cha-cha.

755
00:54:30.368 --> 00:54:34.413
I'm sorry. We seem to be having
some technical difficulties.


756
00:54:34.497 --> 00:54:35.581
In other news...

757
00:54:39.377 --> 00:54:40.836
My apologies.

00:56:24.607 --> 00:56:27.192
I was gonna wait
until after the meal,


772
00:56:27.276 --> 00:56:29.876
but it's gonna burst out of me like
an alien if I don't do it now.


773
00:56:29.946 --> 00:56:34.366
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Okay.

774
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:39.287
This is it, isn't it? I don't know.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.


775
00:56:39.372 --> 00:56:41.748
I mean, I'm ready for this. I
just don't know if I would...


776
00:56:41.833 --> 00:56:44.292
I didn't think I would have...
I'm sorry. Go on.


777
00:56:44.377 --> 00:56:49.131
I didn't know this was so important to you.
Me neither. Me neither.


778
00:56:49.215 --> 00:56:50.674
Oh.

779
00:56:51.843 --> 00:56:56.638
Grace.
Yes.


780
00:57:01.811 --> 00:57:03.520
I got anchor.

781
00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:09.067
Yes.

782
00:57:09.152 --> 00:57:11.945
Apparently, it wasn't
working out with Evan,


783
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:16.366
so he's gonna finish out the
week, and I go live on Monday.


784
00:57:18.244 --> 00:57:22.330
That's great, honey. That's great.
I know. I know.


785
00:57:22.415 --> 00:57:23.999
Wow.

786
00:57:26.335 --> 00:57:28.295
So that's what this is all about?

787
00:57:28.379 --> 00:57:30.922
Well, yeah.
Yeah.


788
00:57:31.007 --> 00:57:32.340
Grace, we got anchor.

789
00:57:32.425 --> 00:57:33.967
Jack's throwing me a party
Friday night


790
00:57:34.051 --> 00:57:36.094
at the Vanderbilt estate
to celebrate.


791
00:57:36.179 --> 00:57:38.805
What's the matter?
Nothing.


792
00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:41.057
Now I lay me down to sleep.

793
00:57:41.142 --> 00:57:42.601
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

794
00:57:42.685 --> 00:57:44.227
Oh, I feel so stupid.
I feel stupid.


795
00:57:44.312 --> 00:57:46.146
Wow, it is kind of
loud in here, isn't it?


796
00:57:46.272 --> 00:57:49.983
No, it's not loud. Geez, can you
keep it down to a dull roar?


797
00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:51.777
What are you...
Thank you.


798
00:57:51.861 --> 00:57:53.021
Is that supposed to be funny?

799
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.780
'Cause that is not funny. If
I should die before I wake.


800
00:57:54.864 --> 00:57:57.115
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
What are you saying?


801
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.451
What is wrong with you?
Stop yelling!


802
00:58:00.912 --> 00:58:05.916
Uh, would you excuse me? I think
I'll take a little trip to the...


803
00:58:07.418 --> 00:58:10.086
The wine is going
right through me.


804
00:58:10.171 --> 00:58:13.423
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.


805
00:58:13.508 --> 00:58:15.509
Keep going, Tony! You're great!
Oh, God.


806
00:58:18.304 --> 00:58:23.892
What is going on here? Oh, what is this?
Give me a break!


807
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.191
Really something, isn't it?

808
00:58:33.986 --> 00:58:36.029
Is this heaven?

809
00:58:36.113 --> 00:58:38.657
No, this is Mount Everest.

810
00:58:38.741 --> 00:58:42.202
You should flip on the Discovery
Channel from time to time.


811
00:58:42.286 --> 00:58:45.914
But I guess you can't now,
being dead and all.


812
00:58:46.999 --> 00:58:50.085
I'm dead? Nah, I'm
just messing with you.


813
00:58:50.211 --> 00:58:54.840
That's not funny, man.
That is not funny! Okay.


814
00:58:54.924 --> 00:58:57.300
And what about the voices
in my head?


815
00:58:57.385 --> 00:59:00.428
Is that part of the hilarity?
No, those are prayers.


816
00:59:00.513 --> 00:59:03.598
And you keep ignoring them, they're
gonna build up on you like that.


817
00:59:03.683 --> 00:59:07.102
But it's just noise.
I can't understand them.


818
00:59:07.186 --> 00:59:09.688
Well, you're not listening, son.

819
00:59:09.772 --> 00:59:11.523
Let's see.

820
00:59:12.233 --> 00:59:14.860
You've had my powers
for a little over a week now.


821
00:59:14.944 --> 00:59:17.112
How many people have you helped?

822
00:59:20.783 --> 00:59:22.659
I took care of a few things.

823
00:59:22.743 --> 00:59:26.121
I righted a few wrongs
in my own life first, okay?


824
00:59:26.205 --> 00:59:28.290
I was gonna help the others.

825
00:59:28.416 --> 00:59:31.751
I think I could help the world.
The world?


826
00:59:31.836 --> 00:59:33.670
That wasn't the world.

827
00:59:33.754 --> 00:59:37.173
That was just Buffalo between

828
00:59:38.843 --> 00:59:39.885
Oh.

829
00:59:39.969 --> 00:59:43.346
I didn't want to start you off
with more than you could handle.


830
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:47.017
Well, you took the job, Bruce,
so I suggest you get to it.


831
00:59:48.477 --> 00:59:51.396
Seeing him smile
would make me so happy.


832
00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.983
Prayers, prayers.
Okay, prayers. Oh!


833
00:59:55.067 --> 00:59:56.985
This creepy whisper thing
has to end.


834
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:59.321
Organization and management
is what I need.


835
00:59:59.405 --> 01:00:04.034
I need a system. Something concrete.
Concentrate!


836
01:00:04.869 --> 01:00:06.536
Files.

837
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:09.831
Let all prayers
be organized into files.


838
01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:17.964
Well, that takes care of the voices.
Not exactly a space saver though.


839
01:00:19.091 --> 01:00:23.929
Grace might notice.
I know. Prayer Post-lts!


840
01:00:31.687 --> 01:00:33.063
Shh!

841
01:00:38.861 --> 01:00:43.239
Okay, I need something with a lock,
security, combination, a password.


842
01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:46.076
A password.

843
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.577
Yahweh!

844
01:00:49.997 --> 01:00:51.456
You've got prayers.

845
01:00:52.708 --> 01:00:56.044
"Welcome to the revelation
superhighway.


846
01:00:56.128 --> 01:00:59.339
"We bless. No mess."
Downloading now.


847
01:01:02.677 --> 01:01:04.386
It's good. It's good.

848
01:01:07.306 --> 01:01:09.391
This is gonna take a while.

849
01:01:15.064 --> 01:01:16.815
One million and five hundred
forty seven thousand


850
01:01:16.899 --> 01:01:19.526
five hundred and three
prayer requests?


851
01:01:22.238 --> 01:01:24.322
I'd better manifest some coffee.

852
01:01:27.326 --> 01:01:29.744
Hola, Juan Valdéz.

853
01:01:30.997 --> 01:01:32.706
Buenos días.
Buenos días.


854
01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:35.667
Disfrute un buen café.
Gracias, señor.


855
01:01:35.751 --> 01:01:38.461
Adiós.
Adiós.


856
01:01:44.468 --> 01:01:48.555
Now, that's fresh mountain-grown
coffee from the hills of Colombia.


857
01:02:09.869 --> 01:02:12.620
It's good. It's good!

858
01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:20.295
Okay, I had to have made
some kind of a dent by now.


859
01:02:22.715 --> 01:02:24.466
Oh, come on!

860
01:02:26.719 --> 01:02:30.305
What a bunch of whiners. This
is gonna suck up my whole life.


861
01:02:31.974 --> 01:02:33.558
You know what?

862
01:02:36.145 --> 01:02:38.188
Yes to all!

863
01:02:39.273 --> 01:02:43.276
Yeah, there you go.
Now everybody's happy.


864
01:02:52.161 --> 01:02:56.164
I'll drink to that. My tech
stocks tripled in five days.


865
01:02:56.248 --> 01:02:58.666
You know something, Joe?
You seem taller.


866
01:02:58.751 --> 01:02:59.751
I am.

867
01:02:59.835 --> 01:03:01.252
My daughter pitched
a no-hitter.


868
01:03:01.337 --> 01:03:04.422
I lost 47 pounds
on the Krispy Kreme diet.


869
01:03:04.507 --> 01:03:07.634
Hey, there he is,
the man of the hour!


870
01:03:07.718 --> 01:03:11.679
Bless you. Bless all of you.

871
01:03:11.764 --> 01:03:16.017
Be fruitful and do long
division or something.


872
01:03:16.644 --> 01:03:18.812
Hey, try that.
It's an excellent year.


873
01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:20.605
Hey, Bruce.
Hey.


874
01:03:20.689 --> 01:03:21.898
Who do you like
in the game tonight?


875
01:03:21.982 --> 01:03:25.443
I like the Sabres. Coach
prays a lot. Okay.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:53.096

Come on, Grace.
Come to the party.


886
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:00.937
I'll call you later, okay?

887
01:04:03.732 --> 01:04:05.233
Come on, Sam.

888
01:04:08.571 --> 01:04:09.612
Help me out here.

889
01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:12.115
Nature's not doing it.

890
01:04:12.199 --> 01:04:14.951
What'd you wish when you...
Oh, Sam, don't! Come on!


891
01:04:15.077 --> 01:04:17.662
Come on. Tell me. If I told
you, it might not come true.


892
01:04:17.746 --> 01:04:20.707
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?


893
01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:22.542
You... You want the moon?

894
01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:26.004
Just say the word, and I'll throw a
lasso around it and pull it down.


895
01:04:26.088 --> 01:04:28.339
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

896
01:04:28.424 --> 01:04:30.884
I'll give you the moon, Mary.
I'll take it.


897
01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:33.344
Then what?

898
01:04:33.429 --> 01:04:37.015
Well, then you could swallow it,
and it'll all dissolve, see?


899
01:04:37.099 --> 01:04:40.602
The moonbeams would shoot out
of your fingers and your toes


900
01:04:40.686 --> 01:04:42.061
and the ends of your hair...

901
01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:56.951
Hey, this is Bruce,
Grace and Sam...


902
01:04:58.454 --> 01:04:59.954
Hi, Bruce.

903
01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.417
What are you doing in here
all alone?


904
01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:08.254
Oh, I was just gonna...
Oh, I mean...


905
01:05:11.133 --> 01:05:14.010
I was gonna give Grace a call.

906
01:05:14.094 --> 01:05:15.803
Yeah, I didn't see her in there.

907
01:05:15.888 --> 01:05:18.806
So, how are you and Grace doing?

908
01:05:18.891 --> 01:05:22.185
Well, actually,
we had a bit of a fight.


909
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:25.104
Kind of...
I'm not sure if she's...


910
01:05:25.189 --> 01:05:26.773
You're on fire, Bruce.

911
01:05:27.775 --> 01:05:30.068
Some women can't handle the fire.

912
01:05:30.986 --> 01:05:32.487
Some can.

913
01:05:33.155 --> 01:05:37.533
That's interesting, 'cause, you know,
I never thought we would ever talk.


914
01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:49.879
Grace!

915
01:05:56.387 --> 01:05:58.304
<i>♪ Everything so confusing ♪</i>

916
01:05:58.389 --> 01:06:02.267
You might wanna stop touching me.
Now isn't a good time. Grace!


917
01:06:02.351 --> 01:06:03.935
<i>♪ Maybe I'm just
out of my mind ♪</i>

918
01:06:04.019 --> 01:06:07.021
Grace! Grace, come here!

919
01:06:07.606 --> 01:06:10.483
Grace, this is so weird.
I was just calling you.


920
01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:11.567
Oh, yeah. What?

921
01:06:11.652 --> 01:06:14.195
And you thought, like,
Susan's mouth was the phone?


922
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.239
She kissed me. I didn't...
I'm the "kissee."


923
01:06:16.323 --> 01:06:17.365
Oh, please.
Grace...


924
01:06:17.449 --> 01:06:18.908
Yeah, you were putting up
a really big fight.


925
01:06:18.993 --> 01:06:21.793
I tried to fight her off. I tried to
stop her, but she's really strong.


926
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:24.289
Okay, I screwed up.
Can I make it up to you?


927
01:06:24.373 --> 01:06:27.458
Yeah! Why don't
you get me a boat, Bruce.


928
01:06:27.543 --> 01:06:29.002
What?
Yeah, a big boat.


929
01:06:29.086 --> 01:06:33.131
And then maybe two big bags of cash.
Then... Then I'll be happy.


930
01:06:33.215 --> 01:06:35.300
Lots of money and lots of stuff.

931
01:06:35.384 --> 01:06:38.428
Other people want idiotic crap like
getting married or having babies


932
01:06:38.512 --> 01:06:40.353
with the man that
they've loved for five years.


933
01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:43.558
But not me, Bruce.
Just give me the boat.


934
01:06:43.642 --> 01:06:45.310
No wonder you stayed single!

935
01:06:45.394 --> 01:06:48.980
Oh! Grace, don't do this!
I'm not doing this.


936
01:06:49.064 --> 01:06:50.982
I'm undoing it.
I'll be at Debbie's.


937
01:06:51.066 --> 01:06:53.066
You take care of Sam
until I can make arrangements.


938
01:06:56.238 --> 01:06:58.197
You can't leave me.

939
01:06:59.742 --> 01:07:04.287
I'm the alpha, lady!
I'm the omega, baby!


940
01:07:05.456 --> 01:07:07.874
Okay, fine. I don't need you.

941
01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:18.551
What's the matter, Bruce? She can't
handle a little competition?


942
01:07:19.595 --> 01:07:21.971
The game's been called
on account of rain.


943
01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:42.200
An unusually high number of lottery
winners has New York officials concerned.


944
01:07:42.284 --> 01:07:45.078
So far, 1,100 winning tickets
have been turned in,


945
01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:47.955
all strangely
from the Buffalo area.


946
01:07:48.957 --> 01:07:50.958
More on this story as it develops.

947
01:07:52.127 --> 01:07:54.003
Enjoying your party?

948
01:07:54.088 --> 01:07:57.298
Nothing like spending quality
time with great friends, huh?


949
01:07:59.385 --> 01:08:01.552
Grace left me.

950
01:08:01.637 --> 01:08:03.513
Yeah, I know.

951
01:08:03.597 --> 01:08:05.098
She'll take me back.

952
01:08:08.477 --> 01:08:11.979
She'll take me back, right?
Would you take you back?


953
01:08:15.734 --> 01:08:17.235
Oh.

954
01:08:18.028 --> 01:08:22.240
How do you make somebody love you
without affecting free will?


955
01:08:22.324 --> 01:08:24.450
Welcome to my world, son.

956
01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:28.079
You come up with an answer to
that one, you let me know.


957
01:08:37.339 --> 01:08:39.590
Rise and shine, Buffalo.

958
01:08:39.675 --> 01:08:43.594
It's 70 and sunny, and the
perfect day to forgive Bruce.

We don't eat that.
Oh, that's not food.


986
01:10:29.576 --> 01:10:34.247
Go to the bathroom, please. Wash out
your mouth. Wash off your hands.


987
01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:36.999
God, I swear that kid
is gonna poop an ornament.


988

All right.
That's it! That's it!

01:10:44.591 --> 01:10:45.967
Hi.

991
01:10:46.718 --> 01:10:50.596
I surrender!
I surrender! I surrender.


992
01:10:54.476 --> 01:10:55.977
Hi.
Hi.


993
01:11:00.148 --> 01:11:06.404
I'm doing my first anchor tonight.
Oh, wow! That's great!


994
01:11:06.488 --> 01:11:08.239
So how have you been doing?
Good.


995
01:11:08.323 --> 01:11:10.157
Yeah?
Yeah. Good.


996
01:11:11.076 --> 01:11:14.996
Just... Debbie won the lottery.
Oh, yeah? You're kidding.


997
01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:20.585
But I guess so did 400,000 other
people, so she only won, like, $17.


998
01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.339
I miss you.

999
01:11:29.094 --> 01:11:30.970
Okay.

1000
01:11:31.054 --> 01:11:34.890
I took the first step.
Jumped out on the ledge.


1001
01:11:36.643 --> 01:11:38.269
Feeling pretty vulnerable too.

1002
01:11:38.353 --> 01:11:39.562
I don't know
what you want me to say.


1003
01:11:39.646 --> 01:11:41.286
Just say you love me
and you want me back.


1004
01:11:41.315 --> 01:11:44.692
No, Bruce. Come on. What
about all the signs?


1005
01:11:44.776 --> 01:11:48.613
How did you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?


1006
01:11:48.697 --> 01:11:51.741
Look, would it help if I just
said that I was a complete ass?


1007
01:11:51.825 --> 01:11:54.493
Hey, you said "ass."
Yeah, but it's okay


1008
01:11:54.578 --> 01:11:55.870
if I'm talking about a donkey.

1009
01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:59.165
I didn't say "hole." if I said "ass"...
Wait! Wait!


1010
01:11:59.249 --> 01:12:01.417
Okay, you know what, honey?
Let's go. Let's go inside.


1011
01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:04.545
All right, kids. Everybody inside.
Time to go inside.


1012
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:09.300
Grace, please, none of this
seems right without you.


1013
01:12:13.805 --> 01:12:15.264
Yeah, I got to go.

1014
01:12:16.099 --> 01:12:17.391
Wait!

1015
01:12:24.316 --> 01:12:25.983
How do you feel now?

1016
01:12:29.321 --> 01:12:32.114
Have you completely
lost your mind?


1017
01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.868
What? Are you drunk? Yeah, I'm drunk.
Drunk with power.


1018
01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:44.210
Love me. Love me.

1019
01:12:45.045 --> 01:12:48.255
Love me. Love me!

1020
01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:51.384
I did.

1021
01:13:04.272 --> 01:13:07.274
Yeah, I know, free will.
Oh, God.


1022
01:13:07.693 --> 01:13:12.154
More power outages reported today
caused by last week's meteorite strike.


1023
01:13:12.239 --> 01:13:15.991
Officials are desperately trying
to repair several transformers


1024
01:13:16.076 --> 01:13:18.369
damaged by
the ensuing electrical surge.


1025
01:13:18.453 --> 01:13:19.995
The scene nearly turned violent

1026
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.415
when hundreds of
disgruntled Buffalo residents


1027
01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:25.501
protested last week's
lottery results.


1028
01:13:25.585 --> 01:13:29.046
And doomsayers are pointing to last
week's strange celestial events


1029
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:32.216
as signs that prophesy
is now being fulfilled


1030
01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.635
and the world as we know it
may be coming to an end.


1031
01:13:36.304 --> 01:13:37.346
World's gone mad.

1032
01:13:37.764 --> 01:13:39.640
Bruce, 30 seconds to air.
Okay. Okay.


1033
01:13:39.725 --> 01:13:42.852
There you are. It's your big debut.
How are you feeling?


1034
01:13:42.936 --> 01:13:46.480
You know what? Fine.
Never better.


1035
01:13:46.565 --> 01:13:48.023
Show must go on, right?

1036
01:13:51.945 --> 01:13:55.740
The Sabres just won the Stanley Cup.
You're kidding me!


1037
01:13:55.824 --> 01:13:58.325
Was that tonight?
That's great, isn't it?


1038
01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:00.244
It's getting pretty crazy
out there.


1039
01:14:00.328 --> 01:14:03.080
We're gonna kick live to Fred
at the stadium, okay?


1040
01:14:03.165 --> 01:14:05.583
Five seconds to the open.
This is it.


1041
01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:07.626
You ready?
Born that way.


1042
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:10.880

at 6:00, with Susan Ortega,


1043
01:14:11.757 --> 01:14:13.257
Bruce Nolan,

1044
01:14:13.341 --> 01:14:16.218
Fred Donohue, sports,
Dallas Coleman, weather.


1045
01:14:16.303 --> 01:14:18.429
And now, Buffalo's
number-one news team.


1046
01:14:18.513 --> 01:14:20.639
I'm Susan Ortega.
I'm Bruce Nolan.


1047
01:14:20.724 --> 01:14:22.892
And here's what's making news.

1048
01:14:24.019 --> 01:14:26.520
What happened? What the hell happened?
We lost power.


1049
01:14:26.605 --> 01:14:28.814
Transformer's down again.
Oh, geez.


1050
01:14:28.899 --> 01:14:30.941
Ever since that
damn meteorite hit.


1051
01:14:33.028 --> 01:14:34.320
It's okay. We're back up.

1052
01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:35.571
We apologize for the interruption.

1053
01:14:35.864 --> 01:14:37.448
And now back to the news.
Bruce.


1054
01:14:37.532 --> 01:14:38.949
Thank you, Susan.
I'm sorry.


1055
01:14:39.034 --> 01:14:41.285
We're going live
to H. S. B. C. Arena,


1056
01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:44.622
where the Buffalo Sabres
have won the Stanley Cup.


1057
01:14:44.706 --> 01:14:45.915
Great.
Fred.


1058
01:14:45.999 --> 01:14:47.875
We're about to uncork
some champagne


1059
01:14:47.959 --> 01:14:53.506
because the Sabres have won their
first championship in 22 years!


1060
01:14:55.926 --> 01:14:57.551
What in the blue blazes...

1061
01:14:57.636 --> 01:15:02.306
We'll be back with the Sabres' Stanley
Cup victory in just a hot second.


1062
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:05.434
In other news... Bloody hell!

1063
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.853
For the love of God, what is it now?
The whole booth is down.


1064
01:15:07.938 --> 01:15:12.274
No, it's not! In other news,
fighting erupted


1065
01:15:12.359 --> 01:15:17.363
in the Gaza Strip today, as
lsraelis and Palestinians...


1066
01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:18.656
Bruce.
What?


1067
01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:21.992
We've got a situation here. They're
rioting right outside the station.


1068
01:15:22.077 --> 01:15:25.371
You're kidding.
The whole town has gone crazy.


1069
01:15:30.252 --> 01:15:33.003
Come on, Bruce.
Say something.


1070
01:15:33.088 --> 01:15:36.549
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
this just in.


1071
01:15:37.259 --> 01:15:42.638
Possibly, the biggest breaking news
story this town has ever seen.


1072
01:15:49.896 --> 01:15:51.689
And I got to go.

1073
01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:54.608
I'm sorry, Jack.

1074
01:15:55.902 --> 01:15:58.112
Susan, it's all yours.

1075
01:16:01.616 --> 01:16:05.578
Sabres! Sabres rule!

1076
01:16:08.456 --> 01:16:12.209
Repent!
The end is near! Repent!


1077
01:16:16.798 --> 01:16:19.758
Come back
with my bubble gum machine!


1078
01:16:24.598 --> 01:16:29.518
The lottery sucks!
I only won 17 bucks!


1079
01:16:31.479 --> 01:16:34.189
Channel 7 fries!

1080
01:16:34.274 --> 01:16:37.026
Oh! Oh, no!

1081
01:16:49.164 --> 01:16:52.708
God!

1082
01:16:54.002 --> 01:16:55.461
God?

1083
01:16:56.838 --> 01:16:58.339
Are you here?

1084
01:17:01.801 --> 01:17:07.932
Hello? I need your help.
Clap on. Clap on.


1085
01:17:08.016 --> 01:17:11.727
Clap on! Clap on! Clap on!

1086
01:17:15.607 --> 01:17:16.982
Figures!

1087
01:17:20.612 --> 01:17:23.948
Well, hello there, 
Bruce Almighty.

1088
01:17:26.534 --> 01:17:30.329
Not as easy as it looks, is it, son?
This God business.


1089
01:17:31.289 --> 01:17:33.040
They're all out of control.

1090
01:17:33.959 --> 01:17:36.669
It's mayhem.
I don't know what to do.


1091
01:17:36.753 --> 01:17:39.713
Well, you're
right on time, 7:00.


1092
01:17:42.801 --> 01:17:44.593
The seventh at 7:00.

1093
01:17:59.317 --> 01:18:01.777
All righty then.

1094
01:18:03.863 --> 01:18:07.408
There we are.
It's good. It's good!


1095
01:18:09.035 --> 01:18:10.911
It's a wonderful thing.

1096
01:18:10.996 --> 01:18:15.791
No matter how filthy something gets,
you can always clean it right up.


1097
01:18:17.043 --> 01:18:20.129
There were so many, I just gave
them all what they wanted.


1098
01:18:20.213 --> 01:18:21.422
Yeah.

1099
01:18:22.632 --> 01:18:26.301
But since when does anyone have
a clue about what they want?


1100
01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:31.140
So what do I do?

1101
01:18:34.269 --> 01:18:37.813
Parting your soup is not a miracle, Bruce.
It's a magic trick.


1102
01:18:39.399 --> 01:18:41.900
A single mom
who's working two jobs


1103
01:18:41.985 --> 01:18:44.778
and still finds time to take
her kid to soccer practice,


1104
01:18:44.863 --> 01:18:46.363
that's a miracle.

1105
01:18:46.448 --> 01:18:48.323
A teenager who says no to drugs

1106
01:18:48.408 --> 01:18:52.119
and yes to an education,
that's a miracle.


1107
01:18:53.788 --> 01:18:55.831
People want me
to do everything for them.


1108
01:18:55.915 --> 01:18:59.251
But what they don't realize
is they have the power.


1109
01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.465
You wanna see a miracle, son?
Be the miracle.


1110
01:19:08.636 --> 01:19:10.471
Wait. Are you leaving?

1111
01:19:11.473 --> 01:19:14.308
Yeah. I see that
you can handle things now.


1112
01:19:14.392 --> 01:19:17.478
But what if I need you.
What if I have questions?


1113
01:19:17.562 --> 01:19:21.899
That's your problem, Bruce.
That's everybody's problem.


1114
01:19:21.983 --> 01:19:23.484
You keep looking up.

1115
01:19:27.947 --> 01:19:32.076
Order has been restored in Buffalo
after this evening's downtown riot.


1116
01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.997
State officials have suspended all lottery
sales pending further investigation.


1117
01:19:37.082 --> 01:19:41.043
No injuries were reported in the
melee, however, there were dozens...


1118
01:20:20.125 --> 01:20:24.503
<i>♪ I've got to be honest

1123
01:20:34.889 --> 01:20:36.098

Evan.
Bruce.


1131
01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:05.127
I suppose you're here to gloat
about the anchor position.


1132
01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:09.089
Go ahead. Take your best shot.
Actually, I...


1133
01:21:10.884 --> 01:21:14.178
I just came to tell you
that I've been a royal prick.


1134
01:21:14.262 --> 01:21:17.806
The anchor position is yours.
I turned down the job.


1135
01:21:17.891 --> 01:21:20.976
Oh, and I never really congratulated
you in the first place.


1136
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:23.604
Congratulations.

1137
01:21:23.688 --> 01:21:26.565
<i>♪ 'Cause you're a God

1138
01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:28.400
Thanks, Bruce.

1139
01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:31.403
In the financial world, things
are settling back to normal


1140
01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:34.698
in what analysts are calling
a fluke market fluctuation.


1141
01:21:34.782 --> 01:21:37.534
You made the right move, Jack.
So what about you?


1142
01:21:37.619 --> 01:21:39.745
Are you ready
to go back out there?


1143
01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:43.498
And do the cutesy stuff?
The lighter side of the news?


1144
01:21:43.583 --> 01:21:47.502
Lower and debase myself for the
amusement of total strangers?


1145
01:21:47.629 --> 01:21:51.089
Yeah, I could do that.
Sounds like fun. Good.


1146
01:21:52.342 --> 01:21:55.844
Okay, Sammy, let's do it right,
like all the other dogs.


1147
01:21:55.929 --> 01:21:58.388
I don't wanna make you feel bad,
but they're laughing at you.


1148
01:21:58.473 --> 01:21:59.598
They're laughing at you.

1149
01:21:59.682 --> 01:22:04.019
Come on. Concentrate. There you go.
Come on. Pump it out if you have to.


1150
01:22:04.103 --> 01:22:05.979
What am I gonna do with you?

1151
01:22:08.942 --> 01:22:11.568
I know this seems kind of crazy,

1152
01:22:11.653 --> 01:22:16.198
but desperate times
calls for desperate measures.


1153
01:22:16.282 --> 01:22:19.910
Yeah. Okay. Okay, Sammy.

1154
01:22:19.994 --> 01:22:21.745
Do your thing.

1155
01:22:21.829 --> 01:22:25.749
That's it. That's it.
Good boy!


1156
01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:28.877

Yippee-yo, yippee-yay.

We're doing it doggy style.

1164
01:22:59.784 --> 01:23:04.037
I'll alert Penthouse Forum.
Hi, Deb. How are you?


1165
01:23:04.872 --> 01:23:06.164
How's Grace?

1166
01:23:06.249 --> 01:23:09.042
I really didn't come to chat, okay, Bruce?
I came for Grace's stuff.


1167
01:23:15.216 --> 01:23:18.677
You need...
No, it's okay. I've got it.


1168
01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.730
I don't... I don't know if she... l
don't know if she wants that or not.


1169
01:23:33.818 --> 01:23:36.778
This is full.
You did all this?


1170
01:23:48.166 --> 01:23:50.334
You know what I do every night
before I go to bed?


1171
01:23:50.418 --> 01:23:54.588
I tuck my kids in, maybe have a
scoop of ice cream and watch Conan.


1172
01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:57.758
You know what Grace does?

1173
01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:00.761
She prays.

1174
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:04.514
Most of the time for you.

1175
01:24:26.621 --> 01:24:29.790
Find Grace Connelly.

1176
01:24:33.127 --> 01:24:34.836
The woman does pray a lot.

1177
01:24:36.506 --> 01:24:39.925
Find Grace, then Bruce.

1178
01:24:40.927 --> 01:24:45.389
"Dear God, please help Bruce find
himself, find contentment, find you.


1179
01:24:45.473 --> 01:24:48.975
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
He seems to be struggling.


1180
01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:51.061
"Dear God, give Bruce strength.

1181
01:24:51.145 --> 01:24:52.687
"Dear God, bless Bruce."

1182
01:24:52.772 --> 01:24:54.314
Bruce. Bruce. Bruce.

1183
01:24:57.985 --> 01:24:59.403
It's her.

1184
01:25:00.238 --> 01:25:03.990
Sammy, it's her. She's logging on.
She's praying right now.


1185
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:07.327
Grace.

1186
01:25:10.998 --> 01:25:12.833
Please, God.

1187
01:25:14.419 --> 01:25:17.879
Please. I still love him.

1188
01:25:20.174 --> 01:25:22.759
But I don't wanna
love him anymore.


1189
01:25:23.386 --> 01:25:26.304
I don't wanna hurt anymore.
Please.


1190
01:25:26.389 --> 01:25:28.014
Help me forget.

1191
01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:35.272
Please help me let him go.

1192
01:25:56.043 --> 01:25:57.461
You win!

1193
01:25:58.921 --> 01:26:00.630
I'm done!

1194
01:26:00.715 --> 01:26:04.259
Please, I don't wanna
do this anymore.


1195
01:26:05.553 --> 01:26:07.721
I don't wanna be God.

1196
01:26:08.347 --> 01:26:11.266
I want you to decide
what's right for me.


1197
01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:14.603
I surrender to your will!

1198
01:26:45.092 --> 01:26:46.259
Am I...

1199
01:26:46.344 --> 01:26:48.011
You can't kneel down
in the middle of a highway


1200
01:26:48.095 --> 01:26:50.388
and live to talk about it, son.

1201
01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:52.432
But why?

1202
01:26:53.768 --> 01:26:55.477
Why now?

1203
01:26:55.561 --> 01:27:00.315
Bruce, you have a divine spark.

1204
01:27:01.067 --> 01:27:04.945
You have the gift for bringing
joy and laughter to the world.


1205
01:27:06.113 --> 01:27:08.281
I know. I created you.

1206
01:27:09.784 --> 01:27:10.825
Quit bragging.

1207
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:14.412
See. That's... That's
what I'm talking about.


1208
01:27:14.497 --> 01:27:16.373
That's the spark.

1209
01:27:21.504 --> 01:27:23.380
What do you want me to do?

1210
01:27:24.632 --> 01:27:27.050
I want you to pray, son.

1211
01:27:27.134 --> 01:27:29.761
Go ahead. Use them.

1212
01:27:36.143 --> 01:27:39.479
Lord, feed the hungry.

1213
01:27:39.564 --> 01:27:43.984
And bring peace to

1214
01:27:44.068 --> 01:27:46.319
all of mankind.

1215
01:27:48.322 --> 01:27:50.657
How's that?
Great.


1216
01:27:50.741 --> 01:27:53.660
If you wanna be Miss America.

1217
01:27:53.744 --> 01:27:57.289
Now, come on.
What do you really care about?


1218
01:28:01.794 --> 01:28:03.378
Grace.

1219
01:28:04.171 --> 01:28:07.674
Grace. You want her back?

1220
01:28:13.639 --> 01:28:15.098
No.

1221
01:28:16.851 --> 01:28:19.060
I want her to be happy.

1222
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:23.398
No matter what that means.

1223
01:28:23.482 --> 01:28:26.192
I want her to find someone

1224
01:28:26.277 --> 01:28:28.945
who will treat her

1225
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:31.823
with all the love

1226
01:28:31.907 --> 01:28:34.200
she deserved from me.

1227
01:28:36.412 --> 01:28:38.705
I want her to meet someone

1228
01:28:43.961 --> 01:28:47.005
who will see her always

1229
01:28:47.089 --> 01:28:49.549
as I do now

1230
01:28:53.888 --> 01:28:55.722
through your eyes.

1231
01:28:56.724 --> 01:28:59.976
Now, that's a prayer.
Yeah?


1232
01:29:00.645 --> 01:29:02.187
Yeah.

1233
01:29:02.897 --> 01:29:05.982
It's good.
It's good.


1234
01:29:06.067 --> 01:29:07.692
It's good!

1235
01:29:09.278 --> 01:29:11.237
I'm gonna get right on it.

1236
01:29:12.406 --> 01:29:14.115
Clear!
Whoa!


1237
01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.660
That didn't feel very good.
Clear!


1238
01:29:17.745 --> 01:29:19.621
Got a rhythm.

1239
01:29:19.705 --> 01:29:21.581
All right. I got a pulse.
All right. Let's set him up.


1240
01:29:21.666 --> 01:29:24.209
Yeah. Get the backboard
and brace.


1241
01:29:27.922 --> 01:29:29.464
Bruce?

1242
01:29:31.425 --> 01:29:32.717
Bruce?

1243
01:29:34.387 --> 01:29:35.845
Welcome back.

1244
01:29:36.764 --> 01:29:40.809
You're lucky to be alive, son.
Someone up there must like you.


1245
01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:59.536
I hear all that stuff winds
up in a warehouse somewhere.


1246
01:30:02.957 --> 01:30:04.791
Grace.

1247
01:30:06.419 --> 01:30:08.128
Hi, baby.

1248
01:30:10.131 --> 01:30:13.383
Oh. Oh, my God,
look at you.


1249
01:30:14.468 --> 01:30:18.054
I was such an idiot.
It's okay.


1250
01:30:18.139 --> 01:30:21.641
It's okay.

1251
01:30:24.854 --> 01:30:28.231
I don't know
what I would have done.


1252
01:30:28.315 --> 01:30:32.986
Oh, God. I swear I wanted
to be mad at you forever.


1253
01:30:45.166 --> 01:30:47.459
Now you're just showing off.

1254
01:30:58.512 --> 01:31:02.807
This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's
First-Annual "Be the Miracle" Blood Drive.


1255
01:31:02.892 --> 01:31:06.853
It's a B-E-A-utiful day,
so come on down here.


1256
01:31:06.937 --> 01:31:09.522
Because the life you save
could be mine.


1257
01:31:09.607 --> 01:31:13.109
Let's go over here, where the Kowolskis
have baked a very special cookie


1258
01:31:13.194 --> 01:31:14.569
just for this occasion.

1259
01:31:14.653 --> 01:31:17.739
Sure, it's a little creepy and a
shameless plug, but we love them.


1260
01:31:17.823 --> 01:31:20.867
Thank you, Mama.
Vol, finger... lose.


1261
01:31:22.036 --> 01:31:24.621
I myself, will have given
blood twice this week.


1262
01:31:24.705 --> 01:31:26.956
For those of you
who haven't heard,


1263
01:31:27.041 --> 01:31:32.587
I'd like to introduce you to the
future Mrs. Exclusive, Grace Connelly.


1264
01:31:32.671 --> 01:31:37.217
There she is. Look at her!
Isn't she beautiful?


1265
01:31:38.511 --> 01:31:42.597
She just gave blood, and she still
has enough left to fill up her face.


1266
01:31:42.681 --> 01:31:46.643
Yes, behind every great man, there's
a woman rolling her eyes, folks.


1267
01:31:46.727 --> 01:31:48.478
I'm Bruce Nolan
for Eyewitness News,


1268
01:31:48.562 --> 01:31:51.564
with all the folks down here at the
blood drive, reminding you to...


1269
01:31:51.649 --> 01:31:54.692
Be the miracle!

1270
01:31:55.402 --> 01:31:56.820
You heard them.

1271
01:31:56.904 --> 01:32:00.532
Okay, cut it. Thank you, Bruce.
Thanks, Ally.


1272
01:32:01.826 --> 01:32:05.161
Hey. How was that?
That was great.


1273
01:32:05.246 --> 01:32:06.996
Yeah?
That was really great.


1274
01:32:07.081 --> 01:32:09.165
Now, you still have to go over there.
The nurse is waiting.


1275
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:11.835
Oh, do I have to?
Oh, it's not gonna hurt.


1276
01:32:11.919 --> 01:32:14.504
In fact, I think you'll
find it quite pleasurable.


1277
01:32:14.588 --> 01:32:15.964

Oompah.
Loompah.


1291
01:33:28.412 --> 01:33:31.748
Doompah. Oh, geez.

1292
01:33:33.834 --> 01:33:34.918
I'm sorry.

1293
01:33:35.002 --> 01:33:38.338
I'm a very rare blood type.
I'm AB positive.


1294
01:33:39.798 --> 01:33:41.382
Sounds delicious.

1295
01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:47.805
Yeah, well, there, you know, there
are storehouses all over the world.


1296
01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:50.808
You know, all over the...
With tons of stuff on ice.


1297
01:33:50.893 --> 01:33:53.853
And it's... Sorry.
You're like this.


1298
01:33:53.938 --> 01:33:56.731
Sorry. Go on.
Okay.


1299
01:33:56.815 --> 01:33:59.150
Positive. IB positive.
Okay, sorry.


1300
01:33:59.234 --> 01:34:01.778
I have a "rarey"...
Oh!


1301
01:34:02.696 --> 01:34:05.114
She has a "rarey." Okay.

1302
01:34:05.199 --> 01:34:07.617
Well, they need my blood.
I have a very rare blood type.


1303
01:34:07.701 --> 01:34:10.536
I'm AB negative.
I'm IB positive.


1304
01:34:10.663 --> 01:34:14.165
- Am I AB negative or am I...
- I don't know what you are anymore.


1305
01:34:14.249 --> 01:34:17.502
I'm gonna need a fricking
miracle to get to work on time.


1306
01:34:30.391 --> 01:34:31.516
Shit.

1307
01:34:35.104 --> 01:34:36.229
Shit!

1308
01:34:40.734 --> 01:34:41.943
That won't work.

1309
01:34:42.236 --> 01:34:43.486
