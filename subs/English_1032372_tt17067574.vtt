The way I see it,
you have two options.

Option one:

133
00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:17.474
you'll notice there aren't
any surveillance cameras

and there's me.

with any semblance
of aggression again,


137
00:09:24.983 --> 00:09:27.684
we'll have each other to say
that it was you.

And then you're looking at never
seeing your daughter again.

Option two:
much better option, you'll see.

00:38:18.215 --> 00:38:19.916
I'm not back yet.

327
00:38:20.017 --> 00:38:22.553
She's probably already
called the cops.


328
00:38:22.653 --> 00:38:25.723
Well,
she thinks you're with Vince


329
00:38:25.822 --> 00:38:27.258
-trying to patch things up.
-What?


330
00:38:27.358 --> 00:38:29.759
I sent a little
message from your phone.


331
00:38:29.859 --> 00:38:31.028
I used your fingerprint.

332
00:38:32.296 --> 00:38:34.064
You son of a bitch.

333
00:38:34.164 --> 00:38:36.634
You planned this all along, huh?

334
00:38:36.734 --> 00:38:37.968
DAVID:
Almost all.


335
00:38:39.203 --> 00:38:41.538
Is that a habit of yours
to kidnap women


336
00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:43.107
and put them in your trunk?

337
00:38:45.409 --> 00:38:46.809
Answer me!

338
00:38:49.613 --> 00:38:50.813
I don't know
what came over me.


339
00:38:52.082 --> 00:38:53.916
I've never done anything
like this before.


340
00:38:55.152 --> 00:38:57.254
Someone driving around
with a hunter's knife,


341
00:38:57.354 --> 00:38:59.356
duct tape
and a bottle of chloroform


342
00:38:59.456 --> 00:39:00.658
looks pretty prepared to me.

343
00:39:00.758 --> 00:39:02.393
Common misconception.

344
00:39:02.493 --> 00:39:04.228
Everybody thinks chloroform.

345
00:39:04.328 --> 00:39:06.563
I mean, people watch movies,
they read books and they think


346
00:39:06.664 --> 00:39:07.731
chloroform's the way to go.

347
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:11.702
By people you mean
murderers like you?


348
00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:13.537
Well, right now
I'm just a kidnapper.


349
00:39:13.637 --> 00:39:16.573
I haven't murdered you, yet.

350
00:39:16.674 --> 00:39:18.908
Ah!

351
00:39:19.009 --> 00:39:21.412
Stop whining.
I barely touched you.


352
00:39:21.512 --> 00:39:23.514
-It's my leg.
-What's wrong with your leg?


353
00:39:23.614 --> 00:39:25.115
DAVID:
It's fucked!


354
00:39:25.215 --> 00:39:27.284
Broken.
Bone's sticking out.


355
00:39:27.384 --> 00:39:29.553
-Does it hurt?
-What the fuck do you think?


356
00:39:31.888 --> 00:39:33.724
Good.

357
00:39:33.823 --> 00:39:35.359
I hope it gets worse.

358
00:39:39.063 --> 00:39:42.066
I bet you didn't expect this
to be used against you, huh?


359
00:39:42.166 --> 00:39:45.135
Pretty effective stuff,
I have to admit.


360
00:39:45.235 --> 00:39:46.203
What is it?

361
00:39:47.738 --> 00:39:49.106
You wanna
know my trade secret?


362
00:39:49.206 --> 00:39:50.240
Mm-hmm.

363
00:39:52.176 --> 00:39:54.578
There are so many
options from desflurane


364
00:39:54.678 --> 00:39:57.247
to sevoflurane isoflurane.

365
00:39:57.348 --> 00:40:00.951
Basically, my recipe ends
in 'flurane', if that helps.


366
00:40:01.051 --> 00:40:02.186
Keep that to yourself.

367
00:40:02.286 --> 00:40:04.488
I'm sure the cops
will be thrilled to hear that.


368
00:40:09.727 --> 00:40:11.128
I tried chloroform at the start.

369
00:40:11.228 --> 00:40:13.063
I thought
you never did this before.


370
00:40:15.999 --> 00:40:17.900
But chloroform,

371
00:40:18.001 --> 00:40:19.269
you can take up
to five minutes for someone


372
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.238
to pass out from inhaling
that shit.


373
00:40:22.773 --> 00:40:24.475
Do you know
how long five minutes is?


374
00:40:26.944 --> 00:40:28.379
Five minutes.

375
00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.281
And in that time, they--

376
00:40:31.382 --> 00:40:35.219
they kick, they punch,
they grab...


377
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.956
tear at your hair,

378
00:40:39.056 --> 00:40:41.458
and you have no control over
how much they're inhaling


379
00:40:41.558 --> 00:40:44.161
because it's all
based on their breathing.


380
00:40:44.261 --> 00:40:49.400
And if they're panicked they
breathe too deeply, too quickly,


381
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.501
you know what happens?

382
00:40:52.169 --> 00:40:55.672
They die,
right there in your arms.


383
00:40:57.907 --> 00:40:59.243
Kind of takes the fun out of it.

384
00:41:00.511 --> 00:41:02.179
So, no chloroform.

385
00:41:02.279 --> 00:41:04.348
I like to keep control.

386
00:41:06.817 --> 00:41:09.086
You're no longer in control,
asshole!


387
00:41:10.287 --> 00:41:11.355
A knife doesn't put you
in control


388
00:41:11.455 --> 00:41:12.523
unless you're prepared
to use it.


389
00:41:12.623 --> 00:41:13.690
Don't tempt me.

390
00:41:16.093 --> 00:41:17.060
At least I'm free.

391
00:41:17.161 --> 00:41:19.530
-Free? Really?
-Mmm.


392
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.499
You can choose between
dying slowly in here


393
00:41:22.599 --> 00:41:23.867
or quickly outside.

394
00:41:23.967 --> 00:41:26.170
That's the only
freedom you have.


395
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:29.706
So, tell me, why the hell
are you still inside then?


396
00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:36.647
Oh, I get it.

397
00:41:37.781 --> 00:41:39.249
You've already tried.

398
00:41:40.684 --> 00:41:45.189
(LAUGHS)

399
00:41:45.289 --> 00:41:48.192
I'm just imagining you escaping
from the trunk back there,


400
00:41:48.292 --> 00:41:50.928
getting outside
and then realising


401
00:41:51.028 --> 00:41:52.029
there's nowhere to go

402
00:41:52.129 --> 00:41:53.530
and you'd have to get back
into the car.


403
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.699
Oh, that's brutal!

404
00:41:55.799 --> 00:41:59.269
It's just funny that you swapped
one cage for another.


405
00:42:00.537 --> 00:42:02.940
Only this time the
shark's inside with you.


406
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.341
A shark with no teeth.

407
00:42:04.441 --> 00:42:05.576
Hmm.

408
00:42:10.414 --> 00:42:11.682
So, what now?

409
00:42:12.716 --> 00:42:14.718
What do you plan to do
with me, Annie Wilkes?


410
00:42:14.818 --> 00:42:16.220
I don't give
a shit about you.


411
00:42:17.488 --> 00:42:20.090
As soon as things calm down,
I'll take my chances outside.


412
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.391
Oh, good luck then.

413
00:42:23.193 --> 00:42:25.395
How far do you think
you'll get in this blizzard?


414
00:42:25.496 --> 00:42:26.396
500 yards?

415
00:42:26.497 --> 00:42:28.298
A mile?

416
00:42:28.398 --> 00:42:30.400
It's minus four degrees outside.

417
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:33.570
-I'll make it.
-No, you won't.


418
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:36.607
I climbed up that hill
and nearly died in ten minutes.


419
00:42:36.707 --> 00:42:38.308
You're not equipped
to make it through this storm.


420
00:42:38.408 --> 00:42:40.644
Even with my hat and my gloves.

421
00:42:41.578 --> 00:42:44.515
Many factors can keep
you alive during the storm.


422
00:42:44.615 --> 00:42:47.751
The body will work overtime
to protect its vitals,


423
00:42:47.851 --> 00:42:49.253
the head and the organs.

424
00:42:49.353 --> 00:42:51.421
It doesn't care
about extremities.


425
00:42:51.522 --> 00:42:54.358
So, I intend to walk away
from here with everything


426
00:42:54.458 --> 00:42:56.093
I have intact.

427
00:42:56.995 --> 00:42:58.395
On the other hand,

428
00:42:58.495 --> 00:43:01.465
many factors can
accelerate hypothermia:


429
00:43:01.565 --> 00:43:04.601
body fat, age,
alcohol consumption,


430
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:07.704
injury- sorry- and wetness.

431
00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:10.941
Your clothes are soaked.

432
00:43:11.041 --> 00:43:13.076
They'll freeze pretty fast.

433
00:43:14.012 --> 00:43:15.479
I'm not sure you'll make it.

434
00:43:16.747 --> 00:43:17.982
-Fuck me.
-Mmhmm.


435
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:19.550
Waitress with
a medical degree.


436
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.419
I don't need one.
I grew up in the cold.


437
00:43:23.854 --> 00:43:26.690
Your best chance of survival
is to stay in here with me.


438
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.393
That'd be the smartest choice,
given the circumstances.


439
00:43:30.394 --> 00:43:32.229
-Trust me.
-Trust you?


440
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:37.969
You know, you and I
got off on the wrong foot.


441
00:43:38.068 --> 00:43:39.503
There's no 'you and I', asshole.

442
00:43:39.603 --> 00:43:41.238
Well,
whether you like it or not,


443
00:43:41.338 --> 00:43:42.806
we're both in the same shit now.

444
00:43:42.906 --> 00:43:44.408
Not for long.

445
00:43:44.508 --> 00:43:46.710
You know
what I'll do before I go.


446
00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:48.412
I'll make damn sure that you are

447
00:43:48.512 --> 00:43:51.248
attached and strapped
down to this chair,


448
00:43:51.348 --> 00:43:54.251
and then I'll leave the car
doors wide open


449
00:43:54.351 --> 00:43:55.652
and with some luck,

450
00:43:55.752 --> 00:43:58.155
we'll find your frozen body
by the end of the winter.


451
00:43:58.255 --> 00:43:59.423
Unless of course

452
00:43:59.523 --> 00:44:01.858
the wild animals have taken care
of you first.


453
00:44:16.239 --> 00:44:17.708
How long have I been out?

454
00:44:17.808 --> 00:44:18.775
Not long enough.

455
00:44:18.875 --> 00:44:20.544
Listen, if you wanna survive,

456
00:44:20.644 --> 00:44:23.580
we've got to start saving
on the fuel and on the battery.


457
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.148
We can only use the heat
for a couple of minutes


458
00:44:25.248 --> 00:44:27.250
every day or else
we won't last long.


459
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:28.652
I don't intend
to stay here long.


460
00:44:28.752 --> 00:44:30.153
You don't know if we have
to stay here two hours,


461
00:44:30.253 --> 00:44:31.722
two days or two weeks.

462
00:44:31.822 --> 00:44:34.058
We can survive without
food, but without heat.


463
00:44:34.157 --> 00:44:36.126
The cold's gonna kill
us in a couple of hours.


464
00:44:36.226 --> 00:44:37.761
Hypothermia, remember?

465
00:44:40.965 --> 00:44:42.332
Turn it off.

466
00:44:46.037 --> 00:44:47.437
Turn it off!

467
00:44:52.409 --> 00:44:53.744
You move one muscle.

468
00:44:53.844 --> 00:44:58.482
(WIND HOWLING)

469
00:45:09.726 --> 00:45:11.795
You are not from around here,
are you?


470
00:45:11.895 --> 00:45:13.630
I like to travel.

471
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:15.699
David Herman Petersen.

472
00:45:15.799 --> 00:45:17.234
That name.

473
00:45:17.334 --> 00:45:18.935
Is that your real name at least?

474
00:45:20.104 --> 00:45:21.538
It's not important.

475
00:45:21.638 --> 00:45:24.241
To me you're just
Fucked Up Motherfucker.


476
00:45:24.341 --> 00:45:25.942
You don't mind if I call
you that, do you,


477
00:45:26.044 --> 00:45:28.478
Fucked Up Motherfucker?

478
00:45:34.184 --> 00:45:36.286
Seems like nobody
knows who you really are.


479
00:45:36.386 --> 00:45:38.089
I'm a shy guy.

480
00:45:38.188 --> 00:45:39.656
And I'm guessing you
don't have a kid either.


481
00:45:39.756 --> 00:45:41.558
Oh, you're a smart girl.

482
00:45:41.658 --> 00:45:43.326
That must be where Ella gets her
brain's from,


483
00:45:43.427 --> 00:45:45.495
'cause it ain't from Vince.

that I didn't expect.
