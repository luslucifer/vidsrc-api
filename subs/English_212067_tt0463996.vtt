00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:07.000
What up, girl?

2
00:02:22.668 --> 00:02:23.495
Hey, y'all.

3
00:02:23.538 --> 00:02:24.322
Hey, hey.

4
00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:25.192
I gotta roll, all right?

5
00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:26.063
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

6
00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:26.977
Quiz me quick, there's a pop

7
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.847
in Spanish.

8
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.761
Oh, did Ely tell you?

9
00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:29.892
We found a DJ for prom!

10
00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:30.806
Hopeful.

11
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.330
DJ Ray and he deejays for all

12
00:02:32.373 --> 00:02:33.461

13
00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:34.680
Hopeful.

14
00:02:34.723 --> 00:02:36.464
Es... esperzo.

15
00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:38.423
Es... esperado... JC!

16
00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:39.337
What up, Shorty.

17
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.381
Lunch, lunch, okay?

18
00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:41.513
Esperanzado, "Afraid."

19
00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:42.383
Atrevido?

20
00:02:42.427 --> 00:02:43.297
You think I should go out

21
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:44.211
with JC?

22
00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:45.125
Aprensivo.

23
00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:46.320
Ely, Ely thinks he'll ask me.

24
00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:47.214
Sela, did you even look

25
00:02:47.258 --> 00:02:48.302
at these?

26
00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:49.521
Uh! I got senioritis and my

27
00:02:49.564 --> 00:02:50.478
brain is just screaming, "Stop,

28
00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:51.305
I'm full!"

29
00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.132
Wait, wait, where are

30
00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:53.046
you going?

31
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.960
Did you even hear what I said

32
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:55.353
about the DJ?

33
00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:05.493
First bell.

34
00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:06.407
We're gonna be late.

35
00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:08.888
No, we're not.

36
00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:19.681
What do you think you're

37
00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:20.552
doing?

38
00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:21.379
We weren't doing nothing,

39
00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:22.293
Mr. Macon!

40
00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:23.163
Mr. Macon!

41
00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:24.686
Come on.

42
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.688
Come on, Mr. Macon.

43
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.910
Hi, Mrs. Howard.

44
00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:33.521
Hey.

45
00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:35.088
Brianna, is that personal?

46
00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:36.002
No, ma'am.

47
00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:37.066
Mrs. Haggerty asked me to make

48
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.048
copies for third period Home Ec.

49
00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:38.918
Is that one of her cake

50
00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:39.788
recipes?

51
00:03:39.832 --> 00:03:40.702
You know it is.

52
00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:41.573
Well, make me a copy.

53
00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:42.487
Here you go. Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.314
Please don't call my father,

55
00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:44.184
Mr. Macon.

56
00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:45.098
Take a seat, young lady.

57
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:45.925
Mr. Macon, please.

58
00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:46.839
And keep it quiet.

59
00:03:46.882 --> 00:03:47.796
Call their parents, Edna, and

60
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.754
tell 'em to come in.

61
00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:49.711
Mrs. Howard...

62
00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:50.582
Step into the office... quiet.

63
00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:51.452
Mrs. Howard, please don't

64
00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:52.453
call my father.

65
00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:53.759
Please don't call him.

66
00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:54.803
Carla, Carla, calm down.

67
00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:55.674
What's the matter, honey?

68
00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:56.501
What happened?

69
00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:57.763
Me and Myron.

70
00:03:57.806 --> 00:03:58.851
They... they caught us in

71
00:03:58.894 --> 00:03:59.894
the car.

72
00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:02.246
That would be the bell,

73
00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:03.377
Miss McCallister.

74
00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:04.204
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

75
00:04:04.248 --> 00:04:05.118
Okay, Carla.

76
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:06.076
It's okay, I'll see you at

77
00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.946
lunch, all right?

78
00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.600
If I don't get expelled.

79
00:04:08.643 --> 00:04:09.644
Would you like a tardy?

80
00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:10.515
No, ma'am.

81
00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:11.603
I'm... I'm very sorry.

82
00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:12.667
Carla, don't worry about it,

83
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:14.910
okay?

84
00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:15.781
Oh, hey, Miss...

85
00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:16.999
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Manning.

86
00:04:17.043 --> 00:04:17.826
Oh, Brianna, have you got

87
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.697
time to tutor a jock?

88
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.698
Stats and probabilities.

89
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:20.786
I'm sorry, but the prom's

90
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.743
coming up and I'm on the venue.

91
00:04:21.787 --> 00:04:22.657
We gotta find a...

92
00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:23.571
Just a few rounds.

93
00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:24.355
You know, uh, just get him ready

94
00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:26.357
for the chapter test.

95
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.314
If Brandon flunks, I can't let

96
00:04:27.358 --> 00:04:28.489
him play.

97
00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:30.274
Brandon Williams?

98
00:04:30.317 --> 00:04:31.144
The team needs him and he

99
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:34.234
needs you.

100
00:04:34.278 --> 00:04:35.627
You don't play fair.

101
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.454
Thank you.

102
00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:38.064
Oh, and congratulations.

103
00:04:38.108 --> 00:04:38.891
I hear you're our new

104
00:04:38.934 --> 00:04:39.805
valedictorian.

105
00:04:39.848 --> 00:04:40.675
Now, I'm just in the running.

106
00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:41.981
I gotta keep my grades up.

107
00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:43.025
Well, my money's on you.

108
00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.897
Thank you.

109
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.813
♪♪

110
00:05:37.123 --> 00:05:38.342
Uh, Randall, hey.

111
00:05:38.385 --> 00:05:39.623
Um, did you get a chance to read

112
00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:40.953
my piece on the power plant?

113
00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:42.041
I did indeed.

114
00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:43.695
And?

115
00:05:43.738 --> 00:05:45.392
Don't care so much.

116
00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:46.785
Let the story speak for itself.

117
00:05:46.828 --> 00:05:48.700
You're reporting, not crusading.

118
00:05:48.743 --> 00:05:49.657
Oh, come on, Randall, that

119
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:50.528
was good.

120
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:51.833
That was front page good.

121
00:05:51.877 --> 00:05:54.227
Uh, a little Lois Lane.

122
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:55.794
Do not patronize me.

123
00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:57.622
I am not an intern anymore.

124
00:05:57.665 --> 00:05:59.101
What do you want, Howard?

125
00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:00.668
Better assignments, Randall.

126
00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:02.409
Sorry, the correct answer was,

127
00:06:02.453 --> 00:06:04.542
"an end to world hunger."

128
00:06:11.026 --> 00:06:11.810
Hey, Brianna.

129
00:06:11.853 --> 00:06:12.985
Oh.

130
00:06:13.028 --> 00:06:15.422
Oh.

131
00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:16.293
Sorry.

132
00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:17.250
Hey.

133
00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:18.643
Mr. Manning said you'd pound

134
00:06:18.686 --> 00:06:19.557
some numbers in my head.

135
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.514
Gotta warn you... head's pretty

136
00:06:20.558 --> 00:06:22.864
thick.

137
00:06:22.908 --> 00:06:23.735
"To be conscious that you are

138
00:06:23.778 --> 00:06:24.799
ignorant is a great step to

139
00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:26.781
knowledge."

140
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.699
Uh, I didn't say that.

141
00:06:31.743 --> 00:06:32.526
I mean, I said it.

142
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.397
It's just that, um, it was

143
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.573
a quote.

144
00:06:35.616 --> 00:06:39.011
Uh, Benjamin Disraeli.

145
00:06:39.054 --> 00:06:42.580
British Prime Minister?

146
00:06:42.623 --> 00:06:44.190
Not now.

147
00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:47.976
Uh, in 1868.

148
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.283
He's dead.

149
00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:53.504
I guess he would be.

150
00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:56.420
Yeah.

151
00:06:56.463 --> 00:06:57.290
I don't even know why we're

152
00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.205
talking about him.

153
00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:00.032
We're not.

154
00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:02.948
You are.

155
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:05.777
Yeah.

156
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.691
I'm busy most afternoons.

157
00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:08.214
I think Thursday is the only day

158
00:07:08.258 --> 00:07:09.322
I could really pound on your

159
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.347
head.

160
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.957
I got practice Thursday.

161
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.871
What about after?

162
00:07:12.914 --> 00:07:15.613
Say, 5:00 I come by your house?

163
00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:16.614
That be okay?

164
00:07:16.657 --> 00:07:18.050
Thursday.

165
00:07:18.093 --> 00:07:20.835
5:00.

166
00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:21.880
Hey, Brianna.

167
00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:22.750
You wanna tell me where

168
00:07:22.794 --> 00:07:24.317
you live?

169
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.536
Right.

170
00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:28.800
Shannon... and Ely...

171
00:07:28.843 --> 00:07:29.844
like this.

172
00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:33.457
And Brianna and Manny over here.

173
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.154
Where's Best Couple?

174
00:07:35.197 --> 00:07:36.590
Speaking of Best Couples, did

175
00:07:36.634 --> 00:07:39.245
you hear about Myron and Carla?

176
00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:40.725
Busted in paradise.

177
00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:41.639
Yeah, I saw Mr. Macon

178
00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:42.509
haul 'em in.

179
00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:43.336
Bet they get suspended.

180
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.250
Suspended?

181
00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:45.358
For a little dashboard action?

182
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:46.208
Carla's daddy is City

183
00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:47.035
Council.

184
00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:48.341
He's gonna flip out.

185
00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.734
She is so grounded.

186
00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:51.213
Bet he won't let her go to prom.

187
00:07:51.257 --> 00:07:52.214
What's your prom getting...

188
00:07:52.258 --> 00:07:54.869
A band or a DJ?

189
00:07:54.913 --> 00:07:56.306
We've got zero dollars.

190
00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:57.219
If people don't start paying

191
00:07:57.263 --> 00:07:58.003
their dues, we're dancing to a

192
00:07:58.046 --> 00:07:59.134
boom box.

193
00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.745
DJ Ray costs six big ones.

194
00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:03.182
Our prom got Ray, so cross

195
00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:04.401
him off your wish list, lady,

196
00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:05.315
'cause we already booked him,

197
00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:06.141
right?

198
00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.012
We're not booking anybody

199
00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:08.405
until the committee votes.

200
00:08:08.448 --> 00:08:09.710
That boy is ours, plus, Ely

201
00:08:09.754 --> 00:08:11.408
knows him.

202
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:12.583
Don't you, Ely?

203
00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:13.690
Yeah, he's my twin brother.

204
00:08:13.714 --> 00:08:14.735
You know, we were just... we were

205
00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:16.021
separated at birth.

206
00:08:16.064 --> 00:08:16.891
Chill out, we can't afford

207
00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:18.023
him anyway.

208
00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:18.937
Well, we can't afford him

209
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.677
either if we want the Skylight

210
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.331
House.

211
00:08:21.374 --> 00:08:23.202
But, uh, if we put our dues

212
00:08:23.245 --> 00:08:25.247
together, I think we could have

213
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:27.424
it all, y'all.

214
00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:28.338
One prom.

215
00:08:28.381 --> 00:08:29.643
For blacks and whites?

216
00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:30.557
Yeah.

217
00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:31.993
When pigs fly.

218
00:08:32.037 --> 00:08:32.820
Come on, it would be cost

219
00:08:32.864 --> 00:08:33.821
effective.

220
00:08:33.865 --> 00:08:35.388
The DJ fees, the hall,

221
00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:36.868
decorations?

222
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:38.565
Divide that by per person dues...

223
00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:40.480
It's two proms like always.

224
00:08:40.524 --> 00:08:42.482
Ray's ours, the end!

225
00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:43.483
Don't make me do no division in

226
00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:44.397
my head.

227
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.746
Yeah, please don't.

228
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.619
Makes her break out in hives.

229
00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:51.404
Shut up.

230
00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.058
What's this?

231
00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:54.015
It's my letter of

232
00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:54.842
resignation.

233
00:08:54.886 --> 00:08:55.756
No dice.

234
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.844
You have a contract.

235
00:08:56.888 --> 00:08:58.193
A first year journalism

236
00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.388
student could do what I do here,

237
00:08:59.412 --> 00:09:00.457
Randall.

238
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.893
The Metro Section won't miss me.

239
00:09:01.936 --> 00:09:03.808
You got another offer?

240
00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:06.593
I'm gonna freelance.

241
00:09:06.637 --> 00:09:07.464
Did I mention you have a

242
00:09:07.507 --> 00:09:08.421
contract?

243
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.291
Then fire me.

244
00:09:09.335 --> 00:09:10.118
Give me cause.

245
00:09:10.162 --> 00:09:10.945
Sell me crack.

246
00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:13.644
Harass the box boy.

247
00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:15.254
Or take a personal leave.

248
00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:16.124
No!

249
00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:17.038
No, I don't need a personal

250
00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:18.039
leave.

251
00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:19.084
You need a lot of things,

252
00:09:19.127 --> 00:09:20.085
Dez.

253
00:09:20.128 --> 00:09:21.260
But I can only give you this

254
00:09:21.303 --> 00:09:23.175
time to review, reflect and

255
00:09:23.218 --> 00:09:26.439
revive.

256
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.440
Go on, get out
of here, so I can

257
00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.399
start missing you.

258
00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:35.230
Prom meeting!

259
00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:36.841
Come if you want to vote.

260
00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:37.755
No proxies.

261
00:09:37.798 --> 00:09:38.582
We're gonna vote on our theme,

262
00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:39.496
y'all.

263
00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:40.279
Adventure in Paradise or Evening

264
00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:41.149
in Paris.

265
00:09:41.193 --> 00:09:41.933
Here you go, now come if you

266
00:09:41.976 --> 00:09:42.934
wanna vote.

267
00:09:42.977 --> 00:09:44.085
No proxies, girl, come on now.

268
00:09:44.109 --> 00:09:46.111
We gotta put this prom together.

269
00:09:46.154 --> 00:09:47.112
Here you go.

270
00:09:47.155 --> 00:09:47.939
Sorry.

271
00:09:47.982 --> 00:09:48.809
Sorry about that.

272
00:09:48.853 --> 00:09:49.984
Prom meeting!

273
00:09:50.028 --> 00:09:50.942
Prom meeting, come if you wanna

274
00:09:50.985 --> 00:09:51.812
vote.

275
00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:53.466
No proxies.

276
00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:18.448
All right, everyone, let's

277
00:10:18.491 --> 00:10:21.146
get back to class.

278
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.203
This isn't something I can

279
00:10:35.247 --> 00:10:36.466
discuss.

280
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:38.119
I just don't understand.

281
00:10:38.163 --> 00:10:40.121
Carla wasn't suspended.

282
00:10:40.165 --> 00:10:40.992
I have all the facts, you

283
00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:42.167
don't.

284
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.124
Kids are saying it's 'cause

285
00:10:43.168 --> 00:10:45.387
Myron's black.

286
00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:46.737
Brianna.

287
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.347
You know me better than that.

288
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.957
They both broke the rules.

289
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:50.828
And they're both being

290
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:52.525
disciplined appropriately.

291
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:53.918
Look, one size fits all is not

292
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:55.702
how I do things here.

293
00:10:55.746 --> 00:10:57.138
Is that really fair?

294
00:10:57.182 --> 00:10:58.009
Well, we'll debate your

295
00:10:58.052 --> 00:10:59.271
theories on fairness another

296
00:10:59.314 --> 00:11:00.141
time.

297
00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:01.142
Look, this is really none of

298
00:11:01.186 --> 00:11:03.014
your business.

299
00:11:03.057 --> 00:11:03.928
Close the door,

300
00:11:03.971 --> 00:11:06.365
I've got work to do.

301
00:11:31.129 --> 00:11:32.260
"Desert Island" is romantic.

302
00:11:32.304 --> 00:11:33.087
Not if you've read "Lord of

303
00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:34.219
the Flies."

304
00:11:34.262 --> 00:11:35.089
Okay, well, then what's your

305
00:11:35.133 --> 00:11:36.395
prom theme, White Man?

306
00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:37.570
Oh, yeah, that's right...

307
00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:38.745
Christmas in July, right?

308
00:11:38.789 --> 00:11:40.181
Winter Wonderland, and I'm

309
00:11:40.225 --> 00:11:41.356
not going.

310
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.357
It's prom, you have to go.

311
00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:43.228
What for?

312
00:11:43.271 --> 00:11:44.142
I don't hang out with them,

313
00:11:44.185 --> 00:11:45.622
I hang out with you.

314
00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:47.058
Come to our prom.

315
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:48.973
Oh, in blackface?

316
00:11:49.016 --> 00:11:49.974
Oh, come on.

317
00:11:50.017 --> 00:11:51.081
We go to class together, we eat

318
00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:52.019
lunch together, 
I mean, we come

319
00:11:52.063 --> 00:11:53.368
here.

320
00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:54.195
Why shouldn't we be together for

321
00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:56.589
prom?

322
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:57.634
No, I mean, she's right.

323
00:11:57.677 --> 00:11:59.374
No, she's wrong.

324
00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:00.462
Prom is different.

325
00:12:00.506 --> 00:12:01.768
Why?

326
00:12:01.812 --> 00:12:03.204
Because there's always been

327
00:12:03.248 --> 00:12:05.816
two proms, that's why.

328
00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:06.991
And two water fountains.

329
00:12:07.034 --> 00:12:08.185
You know, one for you colored

330
00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:09.863
folks, one for us white folks.

331
00:12:09.907 --> 00:12:10.995
Shut up, Ely.

332
00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:12.126
We could pool prom dues,

333
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.388
y'all.

334
00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:14.259
We could have twice the money

335
00:12:14.302 --> 00:12:15.173
and half the work.

336
00:12:15.216 --> 00:12:16.130
So you think you can get the

337
00:12:16.174 --> 00:12:17.001
white prom to get with the black

338
00:12:17.044 --> 00:12:17.958
prom?

339
00:12:18.002 --> 00:12:19.656
What are you smoking?

340
00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:20.807
Tell you what, 
Shannon's right

341
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:22.354
over there.

342
00:12:22.397 --> 00:12:25.836
Go ahead, make your play.

343
00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.447
Loser does bake sale.

344
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.404
Put your apron on and start

345
00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:30.841
mixing.

346
00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:32.712
Done.

347
00:12:38.413 --> 00:12:39.589
"Let's have one prom.

348
00:12:39.632 --> 00:12:40.827
Don't worry, Shannon, we won't

349
00:12:40.851 --> 00:12:42.113
make fun of the way you white

350
00:12:42.156 --> 00:12:44.768
people dance, I promise!"

351
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.778
Shut up.

352
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:56.301
She did it.

353
00:12:56.344 --> 00:12:58.695
Looks like you're baking.

354
00:13:03.743 --> 00:13:05.179
A pack of jellybeans has 144

355
00:13:05.223 --> 00:13:08.182
that are orange and 1,354 that

356
00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:11.403
are not.

357
00:13:11.446 --> 00:13:13.057
If one jellybean is randomly

358
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.146
selected, find the probability

359
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:17.757
of getting an orange one.

360
00:13:19.977 --> 00:13:20.847
Need a hint?

361
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:22.849
I need a break.

362
00:13:22.893 --> 00:13:23.894
Oh, okay.

363
00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:25.286
Uh, yeah, why don't you just do

364
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.610
these on your own and, uh, we'll

365
00:13:26.636 --> 00:13:29.769
check 'em next time.

366
00:13:29.813 --> 00:13:30.640
You like doing this stuff,

367
00:13:30.683 --> 00:13:32.990
don't you?

368
00:13:33.033 --> 00:13:33.904
I think I just like problems

369
00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:35.688
that have answers, you know?

370
00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.037
You work out an equation, then

371
00:13:37.081 --> 00:13:39.126
it's right or it's wrong.

372
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.953
Bet you want to be a math

373
00:13:39.997 --> 00:13:40.780
teacher, huh?

374
00:13:40.824 --> 00:13:41.955
Don't bet too much.

375
00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:44.915
First woman president?

376
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.307
Marine biologist.

377
00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:48.005
You want to study the fish?

378
00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:49.571
And what about you?

379
00:13:49.615 --> 00:13:50.679
Haven't figured it out yet,

380
00:13:50.703 --> 00:13:52.096
but, like your Prime Minister

381
00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:53.793
says, if I know I'm ignorant, I

382
00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:56.013
must be smart, right?

383
00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:57.579
Sela hates when I do that.

384
00:13:57.623 --> 00:13:58.644
You read a lot, don't you?

385
00:13:58.668 --> 00:13:59.451
Yeah, I do.

386
00:13:59.494 --> 00:14:00.278
What's wrong with that?

387
00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:01.105
Calm down.

388
00:14:01.148 --> 00:14:02.193
Nothing's wrong with it.

389
00:14:02.236 --> 00:14:03.020
You just gotta mix it up a

390
00:14:03.063 --> 00:14:04.325
little.

391
00:14:04.369 --> 00:14:06.501
Do you party?

392
00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:08.155
Don't look at me like that.

393
00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:09.026
Come on.

394
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:10.984
Oh...

395
00:14:11.028 --> 00:14:14.379
I am not dancing with you.

396
00:14:14.422 --> 00:14:15.728
Stop.

397
00:14:17.512 --> 00:14:18.513
Brandon, this is my

398
00:14:18.557 --> 00:14:19.427
Aunt Marlene.

399
00:14:19.471 --> 00:14:20.341
Hello, Brandon.

400
00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:21.168
Please, don't let me chase

401
00:14:21.212 --> 00:14:22.126
you out.

402
00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:23.040
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

403
00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:24.128
I was just leaving.

404
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:26.043
Mm-hmm.

405
00:14:26.086 --> 00:14:27.740
See you later, 
Miss Einstein.

406
00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:37.358
Who's the pretty boy?

407
00:14:37.402 --> 00:14:38.185
Uh, that was Brandon

408
00:14:38.229 --> 00:14:39.099
Williams.

409
00:14:39.143 --> 00:14:40.250
Mr. Manning asked me to tutor

410
00:14:40.274 --> 00:14:42.059
him, that is all.

411
00:14:42.102 --> 00:14:44.061
Has he got a girlfriend?

412
00:14:44.104 --> 00:14:45.453
One for every day of

413
00:14:45.497 --> 00:14:46.367
the week.

414
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:47.760
Let me do that.

415
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:48.824
Saw Nita Dawson at the market

416
00:14:48.848 --> 00:14:50.545
today.

417
00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:51.503
You know her boy Myron, don't

418
00:14:51.546 --> 00:14:53.679
you.

419
00:14:53.723 --> 00:14:55.333
She said he got suspended.

420
00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:56.203
Yeah.

421
00:14:56.247 --> 00:14:57.030
I better not ever catch you

422
00:14:57.074 --> 00:14:59.163
in a parked car.

423
00:14:59.206 --> 00:15:00.077
And with Bob Thornton's

424
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.121
daughter... those two

425
00:15:01.165 --> 00:15:02.035
don't have the sense

426
00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:03.167
between 'em.

427
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.690
I asked Mrs. Stephens why

428
00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:05.560
Carla wasn't suspended, too.

429
00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:06.387
She said I didn't have all

430
00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:07.780
the facts.

431
00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:08.650
Facts don't matter when your

432
00:15:08.694 --> 00:15:10.391
daddy's on the City Council.

433
00:15:10.435 --> 00:15:14.004
And it's none of your business.

434
00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:14.918
You keep your grades up and your

435
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:18.008
head down.

436
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:18.922
You wanna be valedictorian,

437
00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.837
don't you?

438
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.707
Then don't be mouthing off to

439
00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:24.754
your principal.

440
00:15:38.158 --> 00:15:39.246
Hello?

441
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.508
Dez?

442
00:15:40.552 --> 00:15:43.033
Oh, uh, hi.

443
00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:43.860
Hi, Mama.

444
00:15:43.903 --> 00:15:44.948
You got a deadline?

445
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:46.340
I don't mean to bother you.

446
00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:48.255
I can call back another time.

447
00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:49.517
No, it's fine.

448
00:15:49.561 --> 00:15:50.649
It's, uh, it's fine.

449
00:15:50.692 --> 00:15:51.519
How are you?

450
00:15:51.563 --> 00:15:52.564
How's Daddy?

451
00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:53.478
Is he there?

452
00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:55.436
Hold on.

453
00:15:57.395 --> 00:15:59.353
He's in the toilet.

454
00:15:59.397 --> 00:16:01.529
We're both fine.

455
00:16:01.573 --> 00:16:02.400
It's always a little hard

456
00:16:02.443 --> 00:16:04.141
this time of year.

457
00:16:04.184 --> 00:16:07.274
Russell's birthday's Sunday.

458
00:16:07.318 --> 00:16:09.581
I know, Mama.

459
00:16:09.624 --> 00:16:10.538
I know.

460
00:16:10.582 --> 00:16:11.365
We sure would like a visit

461
00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:13.759
from you.

462
00:16:13.803 --> 00:16:14.629
I don't know, Mama.

463
00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.370
I'm... I'm pretty busy.

464
00:16:16.414 --> 00:16:18.372
I understand.

465
00:16:18.416 --> 00:16:19.983
We just, well, we just...

466
00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:23.464
we just miss you, that's all.

467
00:16:23.508 --> 00:16:24.335
You know what?

468
00:16:24.378 --> 00:16:26.511
I'll visit soon, okay?

469
00:16:26.554 --> 00:16:28.165
What about this weekend?

470
00:16:28.208 --> 00:16:28.992
It would make such a difference

471
00:16:29.035 --> 00:16:30.341
having you here.

472
00:16:30.384 --> 00:16:31.211
I'll have your room ready

473
00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:32.647
just in case.

474
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:33.561
You can decide at the last

475
00:16:33.605 --> 00:16:34.693
minute.

476
00:16:34.736 --> 00:16:36.434
You don't even have to call.

477
00:16:36.477 --> 00:16:37.696
No, you know what?

478
00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:38.871
I'll be there.

479
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.177
On Saturday?

480
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.222
Um, Sunday, all right?

481
00:16:42.266 --> 00:16:44.224
I'll come up on Sunday.

482
00:16:44.268 --> 00:16:46.313
I'll see you at church.

483
00:16:46.357 --> 00:16:47.924
All right.

484
00:16:53.277 --> 00:16:54.234
Just because Shannon says yes

485
00:16:54.278 --> 00:16:55.714
doesn't make it official.

486
00:16:55.757 --> 00:16:56.802
I didn't say yes, Lily.

487
00:16:56.846 --> 00:16:58.151
I said we'd vote.

488
00:16:58.195 --> 00:16:59.065
That's why we're here,

489
00:16:59.109 --> 00:17:00.153
everybody.

490
00:17:00.197 --> 00:17:01.241
Now, if anybody else has

491
00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:02.199
anything to say...

492
00:17:02.242 --> 00:17:03.504
We've always had two proms.

493
00:17:03.548 --> 00:17:04.418
I don't see why that has to

494
00:17:04.462 --> 00:17:05.245
change just because Carla wants

495
00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:08.422
to get with Myron.

496
00:17:08.466 --> 00:17:09.554
Shut up, Lily.

497
00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:10.424
This has nothing to do with

498
00:17:10.468 --> 00:17:12.296
Carla or Myron.

499
00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.210
Right.

500
00:17:13.253 --> 00:17:14.907
Prom is prom, and jungle fever's

501
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.300
jungle fever.

502
00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:17.127
So next time, keep your pants

503
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.563
on, Missy.

504
00:17:18.606 --> 00:17:19.477
Shannon and I thought it

505
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.391
would be cost effective to have

506
00:17:20.434 --> 00:17:21.653
one prom.

507
00:17:21.696 --> 00:17:22.915
This was your idea, Brianna,

508
00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.177
not mine.

509
00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:25.526
Does Mrs. Stephens or

510
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.590
Mr. Manning know about this?

511
00:17:26.614 --> 00:17:28.268
This is private parties

512
00:17:28.312 --> 00:17:31.054
funded by the students.

513
00:17:31.097 --> 00:17:32.011
Y'all, we do not need the

514
00:17:32.055 --> 00:17:33.491
school's permission.

515
00:17:33.534 --> 00:17:34.709
And if we vote no, you're

516
00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:37.495
gonna say we're racist, right?

517
00:17:37.538 --> 00:17:38.409
Nobody's calling anybody a

518
00:17:38.452 --> 00:17:39.758
racist.

519
00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:41.194
Not out loud anyway.

520
00:17:41.238 --> 00:17:42.108
Why do we even have two

521
00:17:42.152 --> 00:17:43.196
proms?

522
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.198
Ask her daddy.

523
00:17:45.242 --> 00:17:46.306
You want to vote, let's vote.

524
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.114
You guys don't want to have

525
00:17:48.158 --> 00:17:49.115
prom with us, that is fine

526
00:17:49.159 --> 00:17:50.203
with me.

527
00:17:50.247 --> 00:17:51.726
I got enough friends.

528
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.553
Okay, all in favor of two

529
00:17:52.597 --> 00:17:54.555
proms?

530
00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:01.823
All in favor of one prom?

531
00:18:07.307 --> 00:18:08.265
If you think raising your

532
00:18:08.308 --> 00:18:09.701

533

We're gonna have two proms like

536
00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:17.143
we always do.

537
00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:31.723
♪ I've wandered far

538
00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:36.032

539

550
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.831
Amen.

551
00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:37.876
Praise Jesus.

552
00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:38.746
Yes, Lord.

553
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.878
Yes, Lord.

554
00:19:39.921 --> 00:19:41.097
Thank you, Jesus.

555
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.924
God sure is good,

556
00:19:42.968 --> 00:19:46.667
ain't He?

557
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:49.018
We've got Mrs. Lyttle here

558
00:19:49.061 --> 00:19:51.020
from the NAACP.

559
00:19:51.063 --> 00:19:51.977
I'd like you all to give her

560
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:54.806
your full attention.

561
00:19:54.849 --> 00:19:56.025
Praise Jesus.

562
00:19:56.068 --> 00:19:58.288
Amen!

563
00:19:58.331 --> 00:19:59.419
There's a Parent Teachers

564
00:19:59.463 --> 00:20:01.334
Association meeting coming up,

565
00:20:01.378 --> 00:20:03.423
and I want each and every one of

566
00:20:03.467 --> 00:20:06.209
you to attend to lend Sister

567
00:20:06.252 --> 00:20:08.689
Dawson our support.

568
00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:10.169
The recent suspension of a

569
00:20:10.213 --> 00:20:12.084
black student at the high school

570
00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.434
is a matter that concerns all

571
00:20:14.478 --> 00:20:17.089
our children.

572
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.873
And the Mothers Committee is

573
00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.745
seeking an investigation into

574
00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:22.921
school policy.

575
00:20:22.964 --> 00:20:25.097
In addition, we will debate the

576
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:28.753
issue of an integrated prom.

577
00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:29.623
Debate?

578
00:20:29.667 --> 00:20:32.061
What's there to debate?

579
00:20:32.104 --> 00:20:34.585
Anyone with something to

580
00:20:34.628 --> 00:20:37.892
contribute to the rummage sale,

581
00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:39.459
be sure to get it here

582
00:20:39.503 --> 00:20:43.115
by Thursday.

583
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.074
Thank you, Mrs. Lyttle.

584
00:20:46.988 --> 00:20:48.599
In Jesus' name,

585
00:20:48.642 --> 00:20:49.730
let church say...

586
00:20:49.774 --> 00:20:52.603
Amen!

587
00:20:52.646 --> 00:20:53.517
You got something to do with

588
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.387
integrated prom?

589
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:55.301
It's not just me.

590
00:20:55.345 --> 00:20:56.824
The entire senior class voted.

591
00:20:56.868 --> 00:20:57.825
Didn't I tell you to keep

592
00:20:57.869 --> 00:20:59.871
your head down?

593
00:21:03.657 --> 00:21:05.659
Hi, Mama.

594
00:21:07.313 --> 00:21:08.836
That's my girl.

595
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.663
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

596
00:21:09.707 --> 00:21:10.708
Oh, it's okay.

597
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:12.840
It's all right.

598
00:21:12.884 --> 00:21:13.754
Hi, Daddy.

599
00:21:13.798 --> 00:21:15.147
Desiree.

600
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.409
I'll go get the car.

601
00:21:16.453 --> 00:21:17.280
Been a long time, Desiree.

602
00:21:17.323 --> 00:21:18.194
How are you?

603
00:21:18.237 --> 00:21:19.238
Oh, I'm good.

604
00:21:19.282 --> 00:21:20.979
How... how're you doing?

605
00:21:34.384 --> 00:21:36.299
I come by most days on my way

606
00:21:36.342 --> 00:21:38.649
home from school.

607
00:21:38.692 --> 00:21:40.346
Just to check on him.

608
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.001
Happy birthday, baby.

609
00:21:43.044 --> 00:21:44.133
I made a chocolate cake.

610
00:21:44.176 --> 00:21:45.873
Thought about bringing it here,

611
00:21:45.917 --> 00:21:47.440
but then, I don't know, seemed

612
00:21:47.484 --> 00:21:48.963
a little crazy.

613
00:21:50.922 --> 00:21:53.359
Russell and I used to eat

614
00:21:53.403 --> 00:21:54.467
chocolate bars late at night

615
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:57.233
when he couldn't sleep.

616
00:21:57.276 --> 00:22:00.801
The pain...

617
00:22:00.845 --> 00:22:03.021
was that bad.

618
00:22:03.064 --> 00:22:06.242
Well, he's not in pain now.

619
00:22:06.285 --> 00:22:07.199
Come on, Mama, don't cry,

620
00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:08.157
okay?

621
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.984
Okay.

622
00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:10.855
Just give me a minute or two,

623
00:22:10.898 --> 00:22:12.683
okay?

624
00:22:24.347 --> 00:22:27.088
Desiree?

625
00:22:27.132 --> 00:22:28.612
Behind you.

626
00:22:31.397 --> 00:22:35.227
I thought I was seeing things.

627
00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:37.229
Hello, Mark.

628
00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:38.361
Ah.

629
00:22:38.404 --> 00:22:39.275
How are you?

630
00:22:39.318 --> 00:22:41.712
I'm... I'm good.

631
00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:45.977
I hear you're, uh, working

632
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.500
down in New Orleans for

633
00:22:47.544 --> 00:22:48.458
the "Times".

634
00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:49.676
That's impressive.

635
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.808
Yeah.

636
00:22:50.851 --> 00:22:53.245
Uh, how 'bout you?

637
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:54.115
I moved back when my mother

638
00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:55.029
got sick.

639
00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:56.268
I'm Assistant Principal over at

640
00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:57.597
Mercier High now.

641
00:22:57.641 --> 00:22:59.033
I see your mother every day.

642
00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:00.339
I didn't know that.

643
00:23:00.383 --> 00:23:01.253
I guess you never ask

644
00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.254
about me.

645
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:03.386
Yeah.

646
00:23:03.429 --> 00:23:05.388
Oh, I don't much keep in touch

647
00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:08.260
with Mercier.

648
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:09.870
How's your mother?

649
00:23:09.914 --> 00:23:11.437
She passed.

650
00:23:11.481 --> 00:23:13.352
Over in the other cemetery.

651
00:23:13.396 --> 00:23:16.529
Oh, yeah, the white one.

652
00:23:16.573 --> 00:23:17.487
Wow.

653
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.837
Mark, I'm so sorry to hear that.

654
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.707
It's okay.

655
00:23:20.751 --> 00:23:22.274
It's ten years ago.

656
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:23.797
Why'd you stay?

657
00:23:23.841 --> 00:23:25.451
It's home.

658
00:23:25.495 --> 00:23:26.322
I wasn't getting anywhere

659
00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:27.714
in D.C.

660
00:23:27.758 --> 00:23:28.628
It's easier to teach kids than

661
00:23:28.672 --> 00:23:32.980
it is congressmen.

662
00:23:33.024 --> 00:23:36.593
Uh, well, my mom's waiting

663
00:23:36.636 --> 00:23:38.856
for me, so...

664
00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:40.031
I better get going.

665
00:23:40.074 --> 00:23:41.293
Well, wait.

666
00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:42.686
How long you staying?

667
00:23:42.729 --> 00:23:43.948
Would you like to grab dinner?

668
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:46.124
Catch up?

669
00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:47.386
Mark, I'm, uh, I'm only in

670
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:48.450
town for a couple of days.

671
00:23:48.474 --> 00:23:49.301
You know, just to see my

672
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:51.347
parents.

673
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.000
I'm real glad I ran into you.

674
00:23:53.044 --> 00:23:53.871
Yeah.

675
00:23:53.914 --> 00:23:55.916
Nice seeing you, Dez.

676
00:23:58.963 --> 00:24:01.270
Dez.

677
00:24:10.366 --> 00:24:13.978
Oh, come on, Daddy, drive.

678
00:24:14.892 --> 00:24:17.634
Oh, are they talking?

679
00:24:17.677 --> 00:24:18.896
Go!

680
00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:21.290
Oh, my God.

681
00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:22.508
Oh, my God!

682
00:24:22.552 --> 00:24:23.944
Hey!

683
00:24:23.988 --> 00:24:25.903
Oh, my God!

684
00:24:29.254 --> 00:24:30.647
Unbelievable.

685
00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.828
Oh, my God.

686
00:24:37.871 --> 00:24:38.916
Daddy, you all right?

687
00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:39.786
Mom, are you okay?

688
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.657
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine.

689
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.093
Everybody's all right.

690
00:24:47.664 --> 00:24:48.491
Heard that crash all the way

691
00:24:48.534 --> 00:24:52.103
around the block.

692
00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:53.104
What you doing out there in the

693
00:24:53.147 --> 00:24:55.672
middle of the road, James?

694
00:24:55.715 --> 00:24:56.803
Car just plowed right

695
00:24:56.847 --> 00:24:58.414
into me.

696
00:24:58.457 --> 00:24:59.937
See who it was?

697
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:00.807
Looked like one of them

698
00:25:00.851 --> 00:25:01.895
Dupree girls.

699
00:25:01.939 --> 00:25:03.375
I know John Dupree.

700
00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:04.507
I'll check into it.

701
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.247
What kind of car was it?

702
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:07.379
It was a gold car.

703
00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:08.337
I was asking the driver,

704
00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.163
honey.

705
00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:10.227
And she was going at least

706
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:11.078
50 and she didn't even stop.

707
00:25:11.122 --> 00:25:12.515
I need to see your license

708
00:25:12.558 --> 00:25:13.429
and registration.

709
00:25:13.472 --> 00:25:14.386
Wait a minute.

710
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.387
Wait a minute, Daddy.

711
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:16.257
He didn't do anything wrong,

712
00:25:16.301 --> 00:25:17.171
she's the one that ran a

713
00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:18.172
stop sign.

714
00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:19.173
You should be going after her.

715
00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:20.566
I said I know John Dupree and

716
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.959
I know his daughters, and I'll

717
00:25:22.002 --> 00:25:23.874
check into it.

718
00:25:23.917 --> 00:25:25.441
Meanwhile, why don't you get

719
00:25:25.484 --> 00:25:26.548
back in your car and let me

720
00:25:26.572 --> 00:25:28.357
finish up with your dad?

721
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.663
I'm a witness, sir.

722
00:25:30.707 --> 00:25:31.925
Desiree.

723
00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:32.839
Daddy.

724
00:25:32.883 --> 00:25:34.624
Get in your car.

725
00:25:37.104 --> 00:25:38.671
Sorry.

726
00:25:51.336 --> 00:25:52.859
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't tutor

727
00:25:52.903 --> 00:25:53.904
you today.

728
00:25:53.947 --> 00:25:54.774
They're having a... they're

729
00:25:54.818 --> 00:25:56.428
having a PTA meeting at

730
00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:57.777
the school.

731
00:25:57.821 --> 00:25:58.865
Uh, they're gonna be

732
00:25:58.909 --> 00:26:00.867
discussing the prom.

733
00:26:00.911 --> 00:26:02.739
Maybe you wanna come?

734
00:26:03.783 --> 00:26:06.307
To a PTA meeting?

735
00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:08.135
Prom's just a party.

736
00:26:08.179 --> 00:26:09.006
Don't see why you want to make a

737
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:11.617
federal case out of it.

738
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:12.488
Isn't Myron a friend of

739
00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:14.098
yours?

740
00:26:14.141 --> 00:26:15.665
Sure.

741
00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:17.144
Well, the PTA's gonna discuss

742
00:26:17.188 --> 00:26:19.016
him getting suspended.

743
00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:21.758
Let 'em.

744
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:22.628
Won't make a difference for him

745
00:26:22.672 --> 00:26:24.500
or anybody else.

746
00:26:24.543 --> 00:26:25.414
You think it's fair that he

747
00:26:25.457 --> 00:26:27.590
got suspended and Carla didn't?

748
00:26:27.633 --> 00:26:29.766
Brianna, life isn't fair.

749
00:26:29.809 --> 00:26:30.810
Meetings aren't going to

750
00:26:30.854 --> 00:26:31.898
change that.

751
00:26:31.942 --> 00:26:32.856
Some people just like to...

752
00:26:32.899 --> 00:26:33.813
To hear themselves talk.

753
00:26:33.857 --> 00:26:34.727
And some people like to sit

754
00:26:34.771 --> 00:26:36.381
on their butts and do nothing.

755
00:26:36.425 --> 00:26:37.489
Mercier isn't gonna change.

756
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:39.079
Not if everybody thinks

757
00:26:39.123 --> 00:26:39.993
like you.

758
00:26:40.037 --> 00:26:43.736
Trust me, everybody does.

759
00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:47.523
Nobody wants to hear about

760
00:26:47.566 --> 00:26:48.437
Myron.

761
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.350
They don't care that he got

762
00:26:49.394 --> 00:26:50.656
suspended.

763
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.764
They just want to have a say in

764
00:26:51.788 --> 00:26:53.180
this prom thing.

765
00:26:53.224 --> 00:26:54.791
Yeah, but that's a mess, too.

766
00:26:54.834 --> 00:26:56.183
Those kids've got too much time

767
00:26:56.227 --> 00:26:57.663
on their hands.

768
00:26:57.707 --> 00:26:58.577
Teachers need to give more

769
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:01.493
homework.

770
00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:03.539
Mama, what are they talking

771
00:27:03.582 --> 00:27:06.585
about... what's this prom thing?

772
00:27:06.629 --> 00:27:08.108
Oh, uh, Brianna McCallister.

773
00:27:08.152 --> 00:27:10.284
This one.

774
00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:11.808
Okay.

775
00:27:11.851 --> 00:27:13.157
Brianna McCallister got the

776
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.550
seniors together and they voted

777
00:27:14.593 --> 00:27:17.901
to have one prom for everybody.

778
00:27:17.944 --> 00:27:20.425
Blacks and whites.

779
00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:21.252
And the school was okay with

780
00:27:21.295 --> 00:27:22.166
that?

781
00:27:22.209 --> 00:27:23.080
Well, they're private

782
00:27:23.123 --> 00:27:23.950
parties, Dez, don't you

783
00:27:23.994 --> 00:27:25.038
remember?

784
00:27:25.082 --> 00:27:25.865
School's never had a prom

785
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:27.345
because of the insurance.

786
00:27:27.388 --> 00:27:28.215
Yeah, the "insurance".

787
00:27:28.259 --> 00:27:29.956
I do remember.

788
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.002
So, who's this Brianna?

789
00:27:32.045 --> 00:27:32.916
Well, you saw her this

790
00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:33.830
morning in church.

791
00:27:33.873 --> 00:27:35.396
Marlene's niece.

792
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.659
A little troublemaker.

793
00:27:36.702 --> 00:27:37.834
Yes, well, we wouldn't want

794
00:27:37.877 --> 00:27:39.052
to start trouble, would we?

795
00:27:39.096 --> 00:27:39.923
Better to just lie down and

796
00:27:39.966 --> 00:27:41.228
take it.

797
00:27:41.272 --> 00:27:42.142
It's getting late.

798
00:27:42.186 --> 00:27:44.841
I think it's time to get going.

799
00:27:44.884 --> 00:27:47.321
Coming, Jim?

800
00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:48.192
I'm not a teacher and I don't

801
00:27:48.235 --> 00:27:49.759
have a kid at that school.

802
00:27:49.802 --> 00:27:52.892
I've done my time.

803
00:27:52.936 --> 00:27:54.067
You know what, Mama,

804
00:27:54.111 --> 00:27:55.852
I'll drive.

805
00:27:55.895 --> 00:27:56.679
You're coming?

806
00:27:56.722 --> 00:27:57.722
Mm-hmm.

807
00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:00.117
Please!

808
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.858
Quiet down!

809
00:28:05.122 --> 00:28:07.472
Please, let Mrs. 
Dawson finish.

810
00:28:07.516 --> 00:28:09.648
All I'm saying is two kids

811
00:28:09.692 --> 00:28:11.563
break the same rule, they both

812
00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:13.609
get the same consequences.

813
00:28:13.652 --> 00:28:14.914
Never mind who they are.

814
00:28:14.958 --> 00:28:15.828
Whoa.

815
00:28:15.872 --> 00:28:17.482
You want to suspend Carla for

816
00:28:17.526 --> 00:28:18.918
accepting a ride to school?

817
00:28:18.962 --> 00:28:19.919
Bob, please.

818
00:28:19.963 --> 00:28:20.877
Are you implying that Myron

819
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.531
forced himself on her?

820
00:28:22.574 --> 00:28:23.444
Because that's just a damn lie

821
00:28:23.488 --> 00:28:24.358
and you know it!

822
00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:25.272
All right, the question is

823
00:28:25.316 --> 00:28:26.186
being addressed to

824
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.100
Mrs. Stephens.

825
00:28:27.144 --> 00:28:28.295
Will you both please sit down?

826
00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:29.276
We all know that Bob Thornton

827
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.190
is on the City Council.

828
00:28:30.234 --> 00:28:31.061
What's that got to do with

829
00:28:31.104 --> 00:28:32.018
the price of eggs in China?

830
00:28:32.062 --> 00:28:33.019
All right, all right.

831
00:28:33.063 --> 00:28:35.631
Mrs. Stephens.

832
00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:39.156
Well, this is really just an,

833
00:28:39.199 --> 00:28:41.593
an unfortunate misunderstanding.

834
00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:43.334
Carla and Myron were both

835
00:28:43.377 --> 00:28:44.640
reprimanded for being in

836
00:28:44.683 --> 00:28:45.815
the parking lot after

837
00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:46.946
the first bell.

838
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.295
Now, Myron was suspended because

839
00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:50.167
he pushed Mr. Macon when

840
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.037
Mr. Macon was bringing him into

841
00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:52.038
the office.

842
00:28:52.082 --> 00:28:52.952
Why is this the first that

843
00:28:52.996 --> 00:28:53.953
I'm hearing of it?

844
00:28:53.997 --> 00:28:55.389
I apologize, Mrs. Dawson.

845
00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:56.303
I... I thought Mr. Manning

846
00:28:56.347 --> 00:28:57.653
had spoken with you.

847
00:28:57.696 --> 00:28:58.610
This is just a miscommunication

848
00:28:58.654 --> 00:29:02.396
that has snowballed and...

849
00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.660
And I really regret it.

850
00:29:04.703 --> 00:29:06.531
All right, item six, the

851
00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:08.011
senior prom.

852
00:29:08.054 --> 00:29:09.273
There has been some talk about

853
00:29:09.316 --> 00:29:10.666
combining the black prom and the

854
00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:11.928
white prom.

855
00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:13.016
Phyllis!

856
00:29:13.059 --> 00:29:13.886
What is it, Bob?

857
00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:14.887
The prom has nothing to do

858
00:29:14.931 --> 00:29:17.847
with teachers or the school.

859
00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:18.761
Well, we're just opening it

860
00:29:18.804 --> 00:29:20.240
up for discussion, that's all.

861
00:29:20.284 --> 00:29:21.154
Well, this is not a place for

862
00:29:21.198 --> 00:29:22.025
a discussion.

863
00:29:22.068 --> 00:29:22.852
It's on the agenda,

864
00:29:22.895 --> 00:29:23.983
Mr. Thornton.

865
00:29:24.027 --> 00:29:25.855
I suggest forming a parents'

866
00:29:25.898 --> 00:29:27.596
prom committee to look into the

867
00:29:27.639 --> 00:29:29.380
matter.

868
00:29:29.423 --> 00:29:30.599
It makes no sense to have two

869
00:29:30.642 --> 00:29:32.122
proms.

870
00:29:32.165 --> 00:29:33.360
We all listen to the same music,

871
00:29:33.384 --> 00:29:34.385
both committees want the

872
00:29:34.428 --> 00:29:35.952
same DJ.

873
00:29:35.995 --> 00:29:36.779
This is a matter for the

874
00:29:36.822 --> 00:29:37.867
parents.

875
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.608
We will deal with it as parents.

876
00:29:39.651 --> 00:29:40.609
The seniors voted on one

877
00:29:40.652 --> 00:29:42.175
prom.

878
00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:43.089
I second Miss Lyttle's

879
00:29:43.133 --> 00:29:43.960
motion.

880
00:29:44.003 --> 00:29:45.222
We are graduating as one

881
00:29:45.265 --> 00:29:46.876
class.

882
00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:49.661
We are friends.

883
00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.141
Why spend twice as much money

884
00:29:51.184 --> 00:29:52.751
when we could actually...

885
00:29:52.795 --> 00:29:53.665
All right, it's late.

886
00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:54.535
Anyone who's interested in

887
00:29:54.579 --> 00:29:55.928
forming a parents' prom

888
00:29:55.972 --> 00:29:56.929
committee outside of the PTA,

889
00:29:56.973 --> 00:29:59.366
please see Mrs. Lyttle.

890
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.280
I think we're done.

891
00:30:00.324 --> 00:30:01.281
Thank you all for coming out.

892
00:30:01.325 --> 00:30:03.109
We'll see you next meeting.

893
00:30:08.071 --> 00:30:08.941
They want to "look into it."

894
00:30:08.985 --> 00:30:09.855
Let 'em look into the expense.

895
00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:10.726
I could give them exact figures

896
00:30:10.769 --> 00:30:12.249
on what they'd save.

897
00:30:12.292 --> 00:30:13.119
Thornton gives me the

898
00:30:13.163 --> 00:30:14.164
willies.

899
00:30:14.207 --> 00:30:16.514
He's like old school Klan.

900
00:30:16.557 --> 00:30:17.471
Yeah, he's just freaking out

901
00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:18.385
that his daughter has a sex

902
00:30:18.429 --> 00:30:19.430
life.

903
00:30:19.473 --> 00:30:20.344
He's the bigot from hell and

904
00:30:20.387 --> 00:30:21.998
he doesn't even know it.

905
00:30:22.041 --> 00:30:22.955
No, he knows it.

906
00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:23.826
He just doesn't know that he

907
00:30:23.869 --> 00:30:24.696
knows it.

908
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:25.566
Lots of black parents are

909
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.699
against it, too.

910
00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:28.613
I don't know.

911
00:30:28.657 --> 00:30:29.483
It's gonna ruin prom.

912
00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:30.615
We should just forget it.

913
00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:31.877
Kelly's right.

914
00:30:31.921 --> 00:30:32.922
We should just forget it.

915
00:30:32.965 --> 00:30:34.532
I mean, this is prom, you know?

916
00:30:34.575 --> 00:30:35.446
We're supposed to be having a

917
00:30:35.489 --> 00:30:36.577
good time.

918
00:30:36.621 --> 00:30:37.622
Let's talk hair.

919
00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:38.797
Or let's talk about shoes.

920
00:30:38.841 --> 00:30:41.452
Or... let's talk about you and

921
00:30:41.495 --> 00:30:43.759
Brandon Williams getting it on.

922
00:30:43.802 --> 00:30:44.716
Whoa, whoa, not in front of

923
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.196
the boy, Sela, okay?

924
00:30:46.239 --> 00:30:47.110
Now, he's a virgin.

925
00:30:47.153 --> 00:30:48.024
There is nothing going on

926
00:30:48.067 --> 00:30:49.242
between us, y'all.

927
00:30:49.286 --> 00:30:50.393
I am tutoring him, that is all.

928
00:30:50.417 --> 00:30:51.723
Ely and I saw you talking to

929
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:53.246
him, didn't we?

930
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.204
Love was in the air.

931
00:30:54.247 --> 00:30:55.248
I mean, I heard bells.

932
00:30:55.292 --> 00:30:56.728
If he asked you to prom,

933
00:30:56.772 --> 00:30:57.642
you'd faint.

934
00:30:57.686 --> 00:30:58.817
Not before I said no.

935
00:30:58.861 --> 00:30:59.949
You are so full of it.

936
00:30:59.992 --> 00:31:00.993
He is apathetic.

937
00:31:01.037 --> 00:31:01.907
Uh-oh.

938
00:31:01.951 --> 00:31:02.734
Big words.

939
00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:03.798
She's using the big words.

940
00:31:03.822 --> 00:31:04.649
Uh-huh.

941
00:31:04.693 --> 00:31:06.216
She must really like him.

942
00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:07.130
"Apathy is the glove into

943
00:31:07.173 --> 00:31:08.522
which evil slips his hand."

944
00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:10.002
Ew... la, la, la, la, la, la!

945
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:16.139
Uh, you know, Mama, I'm gonna

946
00:31:16.182 --> 00:31:17.662
walk home, okay? Okay.

947
00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:18.576
You all right to drive back?

948
00:31:18.619 --> 00:31:19.490
Oh, I'm fine.

949
00:31:19.533 --> 00:31:20.360
Okay.

950
00:31:20.404 --> 00:31:21.927
Okay. Bye, baby.

951
00:31:21.971 --> 00:31:25.104
See you later.

952
00:31:25.148 --> 00:31:26.062
Hey, can I talk to you for a

953
00:31:26.105 --> 00:31:27.280
second?

954
00:31:27.324 --> 00:31:29.108
Um, we saw each other in church.

955
00:31:29.152 --> 00:31:30.762
We didn't actually meet.

956
00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:31.632
I'm, uh, Desiree Howard.

957
00:31:31.676 --> 00:31:32.546
Yes, I know you.

958
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.939
Mrs. Howard's daughter.

959
00:31:33.983 --> 00:31:34.810
Yeah.

960
00:31:34.853 --> 00:31:35.724
I'm Brianna McCallister.

961
00:31:35.767 --> 00:31:36.550
Nice to meet you.

962
00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:38.030
Nice to meet you as well.

963
00:31:38.074 --> 00:31:39.510
It's not an original idea,

964
00:31:39.553 --> 00:31:40.772
you know.

965
00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:41.730
Most schools have one senior

966
00:31:41.773 --> 00:31:42.687
prom.

967
00:31:42.731 --> 00:31:43.862
Yeah, but, you know, this is

968
00:31:43.906 --> 00:31:44.907
Mercier.

969
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.908
And we're not just talking about

970
00:31:45.951 --> 00:31:47.300
any prom, we're talking about an

971
00:31:47.344 --> 00:31:49.041
integrated prom.

972
00:31:49.085 --> 00:31:49.955
No one says "integrated"

973
00:31:49.999 --> 00:31:52.088
about our schools anymore.

974
00:31:52.131 --> 00:31:53.002
Just 'cause someone doesn't

975
00:31:53.045 --> 00:31:54.153
say a word out loud doesn't mean

976
00:31:54.177 --> 00:31:55.526
they're not thinking it.

977
00:31:55.569 --> 00:31:56.440
I'm sure nobody says

978
00:31:56.483 --> 00:31:57.354
"segregated" about the school

979
00:31:57.397 --> 00:31:58.224
either.

980
00:31:58.268 --> 00:31:59.356
I went to school here, too.

981
00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:01.227
And we called it black prom and

982
00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:02.446
white prom.

983
00:32:02.489 --> 00:32:03.447
And we didn't think about

984
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.404
it as being segregated,

985
00:32:04.448 --> 00:32:06.798
but that's what it was.

986
00:32:06.842 --> 00:32:08.060
That's what you're fighting.

987
00:32:08.104 --> 00:32:09.192
It's not a fight.

988
00:32:09.235 --> 00:32:10.106
We're friends.

989
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.889
We just want to have our parties

990
00:32:10.933 --> 00:32:11.803
together.

991
00:32:11.847 --> 00:32:14.066
It's... it's not that big a deal.

992
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.174
Then why all the objections

993
00:32:15.198 --> 00:32:16.939
and the committees and...

994
00:32:16.982 --> 00:32:17.896
You used to live here, right?

995
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.810
You know exactly how it is.

996
00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:19.768
You get a haircut, everybody

997
00:32:19.811 --> 00:32:20.681
gotta say something about it.

998
00:32:20.725 --> 00:32:22.814
"Girl, you look cute.

999
00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:23.815
Girl, what'd you do to your

1000
00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:24.729
hair, where'd you go to?

1001
00:32:24.773 --> 00:32:25.599
Can I go?

1002
00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:26.426
Your mama ain't goin' like

1003
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.253
that."

1004
00:32:27.297 --> 00:32:28.124
It's just a small town,

1005
00:32:28.167 --> 00:32:29.081
that's all.

1006
00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:30.604
Yeah, that's true.

1007
00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:31.867
I mean, there are small towns

1008
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.129
and there are small towns.

1009
00:32:33.172 --> 00:32:34.652
And then there's Mercier.

1010
00:32:34.695 --> 00:32:36.306
Which is stuck in a time warp.

1011
00:32:36.349 --> 00:32:37.457
I mean, I went to school here 14

1012
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:38.675
years ago and it's the same now

1013
00:32:38.699 --> 00:32:41.615
as it was then.

1014
00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:43.008
"Change your thoughts and you

1015
00:32:43.052 --> 00:32:44.575
change your world."

1016
00:32:44.618 --> 00:32:45.924
Norman Vincent Peale.

1017
00:32:45.968 --> 00:32:47.404
That is impressive.

1018
00:32:47.447 --> 00:32:48.492
Wow.

1019
00:32:48.535 --> 00:32:49.928
Okay, then tell me.

1020
00:32:49.972 --> 00:32:52.757
What are your thoughts?

1021
00:32:52.801 --> 00:32:55.412
My thoughts are...

1022
00:32:55.455 --> 00:32:57.066
we are going to have one

1023
00:32:57.109 --> 00:32:57.936
class prom.

1024
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.112
The whole class.

1025
00:33:00.156 --> 00:33:02.636
It's gonna be the best prom in

1026
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.292
the history of Mercier High.

1027
00:33:06.336 --> 00:33:10.035
And everybody... and I mean

1028
00:33:10.079 --> 00:33:13.082
everybody... is gonna be glad

1029
00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:14.823
they came.

1030
00:33:40.892 --> 00:33:42.981
Daddy?

1031
00:33:45.592 --> 00:33:48.073
Um, why don't you go on up

1032
00:33:48.117 --> 00:33:50.336
to bed?

1033
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.817
I'm 55 years old.

1034
00:33:52.861 --> 00:33:53.644
I get to pick my own bedtime

1035
00:33:53.687 --> 00:33:55.864
now.

1036
00:34:04.524 --> 00:34:05.308
How long are you staying,

1037
00:34:05.351 --> 00:34:07.179
Desiree?

1038
00:34:07.223 --> 00:34:10.052
Why, Daddy?

1039
00:34:12.402 --> 00:34:14.665
Sick of me already?

1040
00:34:14.708 --> 00:34:15.579
Well, you don't visit in two

1041
00:34:15.622 --> 00:34:17.407
years, your mother's got to go

1042
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:19.800
visit you, busy even at

1043
00:34:19.844 --> 00:34:20.801
Christmas time, but now you're

1044
00:34:20.845 --> 00:34:24.805
here.

1045
00:34:24.849 --> 00:34:26.372
You were fired?

1046
00:34:26.416 --> 00:34:28.374
It was a personal leave.

1047
00:34:28.418 --> 00:34:29.245
Is that newspaper jargon for

1048
00:34:29.288 --> 00:34:31.682
out of a job?

1049
00:34:31.725 --> 00:34:33.031
I told my editor I wanted to

1050
00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:33.945
quit because I wasn't getting

1051
00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.009
the assignments I deserved...

1052
00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:35.947
Hey.

1053
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:37.949
I don't want to hear that.

1054
00:34:37.993 --> 00:34:38.819
Nothing is ever good enough

1055
00:34:38.863 --> 00:34:39.995
for you.

1056
00:34:40.038 --> 00:34:41.648
Not your family, not this town,

1057
00:34:41.692 --> 00:34:44.173
now your job.

1058
00:34:44.216 --> 00:34:46.566
You're ungrateful.

1059
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.221
That is not true.

1060
00:34:49.265 --> 00:34:50.135
Never a word of complaint out

1061
00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.267
of Russell.

1062
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.137
And he had a lot to complain

1063
00:34:52.181 --> 00:34:53.530
about.

1064
00:34:53.573 --> 00:34:56.359
Look at you.

1065
00:34:56.402 --> 00:34:58.927
What are you saying, Daddy?

1066
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.146
That you wish I had sickle cell?

1067
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.973
You could get a job right

1068
00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:03.714
here in Mercier.

1069
00:35:03.757 --> 00:35:04.584
Your mother would like to have

1070
00:35:04.628 --> 00:35:08.110
you close.

1071
00:35:08.153 --> 00:35:10.155
It's all still very hard on her.

1072
00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:13.202
Do you realize that?

1073
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.484
Mama wants me where I can be

1074
00:35:15.508 --> 00:35:16.727
happy and I cannot be a

1075
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.121
journalist here in Mercier.

1076
00:35:19.164 --> 00:35:20.035
Don't look like you can be a

1077
00:35:20.078 --> 00:35:21.514
journalist in New Orleans,

1078
00:35:21.558 --> 00:35:23.908
either.

1079
00:35:27.346 --> 00:35:30.610
Yeah, well, I'm trying.

1080
00:35:30.654 --> 00:35:32.830
I can't be Russell, but I'm

1081
00:35:32.873 --> 00:35:35.964
working real hard to be Desiree.

1082
00:35:44.711 --> 00:35:45.582
Come on, y'all.

1083
00:35:45.625 --> 00:35:46.931
Car wash time.

1084
00:35:46.975 --> 00:35:48.019
Vans, ten dollars.

1085
00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:49.151
Cars are five.

1086
00:35:49.194 --> 00:35:50.326
It's for a good cause now.

1087
00:35:50.369 --> 00:35:51.849
We gotta go to the prom.

1088
00:35:51.892 --> 00:35:53.416
All right, car wash!

1089
00:35:53.459 --> 00:35:55.287
Car wash, anybody?

1090
00:35:57.811 --> 00:36:02.164
♪♪

1091
00:36:14.002 --> 00:36:16.004
Come on!

1092
00:36:27.015 --> 00:36:27.885
Is Kelly here?

1093
00:36:27.928 --> 00:36:29.147
She's a no show.

1094
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:30.018
But ask me if I've seen

1095
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:32.107
Mr. Fine As Hell.

1096
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.195
What?

1097
00:36:33.238 --> 00:36:34.152
Wipe the soap off your chin.

1098
00:36:34.196 --> 00:36:35.588
Here he comes.

1099
00:36:40.767 --> 00:36:41.594
Thought you guys could use

1100
00:36:41.638 --> 00:36:42.465
some muscle.

1101
00:36:42.508 --> 00:36:43.335
You thought right.

1102
00:36:43.379 --> 00:36:44.249
Wash or wax?

1103
00:36:44.293 --> 00:36:45.511
We'll wash.

1104
00:36:45.555 --> 00:36:49.037
Well, follow me, boys.

1105
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.864
Uh, you want to wax.

1106
00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:52.040
No, I don't.

1107
00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:53.389
Yes, you do.

1108
00:36:53.432 --> 00:36:56.827
The red car.

1109
00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:00.178
Thanks.

1110
00:37:00.222 --> 00:37:01.136
I thought Cupid was a little

1111
00:37:01.179 --> 00:37:02.659
guy with arrows.

1112
00:37:02.702 --> 00:37:04.487
Hi.

1113
00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:16.934
What's up?

1114
00:37:16.977 --> 00:37:19.371
I got a C-plus on my test.

1115
00:37:19.415 --> 00:37:20.459
I owe you one.

1116
00:37:20.503 --> 00:37:21.373
Bet you coulda got a B if you

1117
00:37:21.417 --> 00:37:22.244
wanted.

1118
00:37:22.287 --> 00:37:24.724
Mm, C's good enough.

1119
00:37:24.768 --> 00:37:25.638
If I do any better than that on

1120
00:37:25.682 --> 00:37:26.702
stats, my old man'll have a

1121
00:37:26.726 --> 00:37:28.337
stroke.

1122
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.207
I didn't mean to start a

1123
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:30.252
fight with you.

1124
00:37:30.295 --> 00:37:31.166
It wasn't a fight.

1125
00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:32.471
It was a difference of opinion.

1126
00:37:32.515 --> 00:37:33.385
Think two people can have

1127
00:37:33.429 --> 00:37:34.580
different opinions and still be

1128
00:37:34.604 --> 00:37:36.127
friends?

1129
00:37:36.171 --> 00:37:37.346
It depends.

1130
00:37:37.389 --> 00:37:38.608
On what?

1131
00:37:38.651 --> 00:37:39.435
Some things are just too

1132
00:37:39.478 --> 00:37:42.046
important to compromise.

1133
00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:46.746
You know they've been calling

1134
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.835
Myron's house every day.

1135
00:37:48.879 --> 00:37:49.967
Threatening him.

1136
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:50.881
Telling him if he goes anywhere

1137
00:37:50.924 --> 00:37:52.622
near Carla, he's a dead nigger.

1138
00:37:52.665 --> 00:37:53.710
Are you serious?

1139
00:37:53.753 --> 00:37:55.190
Yes.

1140
00:37:55.233 --> 00:37:56.582
All this talk about blacks and

1141
00:37:56.626 --> 00:37:58.323
whites being together for prom?

1142
00:37:58.367 --> 00:38:00.891
It gets people thinking.

1143
00:38:00.934 --> 00:38:03.546
It gets 'em mad.

1144
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:04.416
Is prom too important to

1145
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.462
compromise, Brianna?

1146
00:38:06.505 --> 00:38:08.812
I'm just asking.

1147
00:38:08.855 --> 00:38:09.726
I've had this headache for

1148
00:38:09.769 --> 00:38:10.988
four days.

1149
00:38:11.031 --> 00:38:12.120
I wouldn't wonder.

1150
00:38:12.163 --> 00:38:13.947
It's just them damn kids.

1151
00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:15.079
Of course it is.

1152
00:38:15.123 --> 00:38:16.187
And I told Myron if I see him

1153
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:18.038
near that hootchie girl again,

1154
00:38:18.082 --> 00:38:20.215
I will take the car keys.

1155
00:38:20.258 --> 00:38:21.390
Mm-hmm.

1156
00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:22.304
She's not the first boy she

1157
00:38:22.347 --> 00:38:23.957
done took into the parking lot.

1158
00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:24.784
That's for sure.

1159
00:38:24.828 --> 00:38:27.831
That's for sure.

1160
00:38:29.485 --> 00:38:31.443
Speaking of hootchie, guess

1161
00:38:31.487 --> 00:38:33.793
who just walked in.

1162
00:38:33.837 --> 00:38:34.620
What's she doing with

1163
00:38:34.664 --> 00:38:35.534
Mark Manning?

1164
00:38:35.578 --> 00:38:36.448
Private high school reunion

1165
00:38:36.492 --> 00:38:37.319
maybe?

1166
00:38:37.362 --> 00:38:38.233
Huh?

1167
00:38:38.276 --> 00:38:39.147
Oh, you didn't hear about

1168
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:40.060
that?

1169
00:38:40.104 --> 00:38:40.887
Uh-huh.

1170
00:38:40.931 --> 00:38:41.714
Hot and heavy.

1171
00:38:41.758 --> 00:38:42.759
Big secret.

1172
00:38:42.802 --> 00:38:43.586
They were never seen together in

1173
00:38:43.629 --> 00:38:45.414
public, but...

1174
00:38:45.457 --> 00:38:47.111
Yes, indeed.

1175
00:38:47.155 --> 00:38:49.157
Oh, uh...

1176
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.027
Thank you.

1177
00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:50.897
Thank you.

1178
00:38:50.941 --> 00:38:53.291
Hey.

1179
00:38:53.335 --> 00:38:54.205
Thank you for meeting me

1180
00:38:54.249 --> 00:38:55.119
here.

1181
00:38:55.163 --> 00:38:55.946
I never turn down lunch at

1182
00:38:55.989 --> 00:38:57.121
Trudi's.

1183
00:38:57.165 --> 00:38:58.253
I want to talk about prom.

1184
00:38:58.296 --> 00:38:59.384
Well, I woulda taken you.

1185
00:38:59.428 --> 00:39:00.579
You were the one who said no.

1186
00:39:00.603 --> 00:39:01.517
Well, to the black prom or

1187
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.258
the white one?

1188
00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:04.409
I mean, what if there'd been an

1189
00:39:04.433 --> 00:39:05.564
integrated prom back then?

1190
00:39:05.608 --> 00:39:08.306
What if there was one now?

1191
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.501
Why do I suddenly feel like I

1192
00:39:09.525 --> 00:39:11.004
need a lawyer?

1193
00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:11.831
It's not a trick question,

1194
00:39:11.875 --> 00:39:13.181
Mark.

1195
00:39:13.224 --> 00:39:14.965
Is it an interview?

1196
00:39:15.008 --> 00:39:18.360
No, I just want your opinion.

1197
00:39:18.403 --> 00:39:19.578
As the Assistant Principal of

1198
00:39:19.622 --> 00:39:21.493
Mercier or as an old friend?

1199
00:39:21.537 --> 00:39:22.364
'Cause you know the school has

1200
00:39:22.407 --> 00:39:23.843
nothing to do with the prom.

1201
00:39:23.887 --> 00:39:24.994
A state funded school cannot

1202
00:39:25.018 --> 00:39:26.281
sanction segregation.

1203
00:39:26.324 --> 00:39:27.543
Segregation's a pretty strong

1204
00:39:27.586 --> 00:39:28.544
word, don't you think?

1205
00:39:28.587 --> 00:39:29.545
Well, how 'bout separate but

1206
00:39:29.588 --> 00:39:30.720
equal?

1207
00:39:30.763 --> 00:39:33.940
You like that better?

1208
00:39:33.984 --> 00:39:36.856
You're the writer.

1209
00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:41.426
Uh-oh.

1210
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.559
Uh, don't look.

1211
00:39:43.602 --> 00:39:44.690
Your rep is ruined.

1212
00:39:44.734 --> 00:39:45.561
We're being scrutinized by the

1213
00:39:45.604 --> 00:39:46.475
town gossip.

1214
00:39:46.518 --> 00:39:47.389
Don't!

1215
00:39:47.432 --> 00:39:48.477
Stop it.

1216
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.913
Ugh.

1217
00:39:49.956 --> 00:39:51.306
Marlene Armstrong never

1218
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:52.655
liked me.

1219
00:39:52.698 --> 00:39:53.917
Oh, she's just jealous.

1220
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.918
Of me.

1221
00:39:54.961 --> 00:39:55.745
I think all the girls were

1222
00:39:55.788 --> 00:39:56.746
jealous of you.

1223
00:39:56.789 --> 00:39:59.488
Prettiest girl in the class.

1224
00:40:00.706 --> 00:40:01.620
Damn, Dez, it's...

1225
00:40:01.664 --> 00:40:02.534
Mark, don't.

1226
00:40:02.578 --> 00:40:03.492
Let me just say it.

1227
00:40:03.535 --> 00:40:04.884
Say what?

1228
00:40:04.928 --> 00:40:07.147
Look, we were kids.

1229
00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:11.500
Look, I talked to Brianna

1230
00:40:11.543 --> 00:40:13.719
McCallister and I don't think

1231
00:40:13.763 --> 00:40:15.199
she knows what she's doing.

1232
00:40:15.243 --> 00:40:16.394
She could get really hurt, Mark.

1233
00:40:16.418 --> 00:40:18.985
Don't underestimate Brianna.

1234
00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:25.818
It's not school business.

1235
00:40:25.862 --> 00:40:26.645
I know, Jenny.

1236
00:40:26.689 --> 00:40:27.516
We're all just concerned

1237
00:40:27.559 --> 00:40:28.386
neighbors here.

1238
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:29.474
The faculty isn't doing

1239
00:40:29.518 --> 00:40:30.388
anything to encourage these

1240
00:40:30.432 --> 00:40:31.302
kids.

1241
00:40:31.346 --> 00:40:32.564
And I appreciate that, Ron.

1242
00:40:32.608 --> 00:40:33.478
On the other hand, what's

1243
00:40:33.522 --> 00:40:34.784
being done to discourage them?

1244
00:40:34.827 --> 00:40:35.698
They just want to party with

1245
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:37.134
their friends, that's all.

1246
00:40:37.177 --> 00:40:38.309
We've been having two proms

1247
00:40:38.353 --> 00:40:39.310
since for as long as I can

1248
00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:40.398
remember.

1249
00:40:40.442 --> 00:40:41.549
And when a tradition is older

1250
00:40:41.573 --> 00:40:42.966
than me, well, there's got to be

1251
00:40:43.009 --> 00:40:44.359
a good reason for it.

1252
00:40:44.402 --> 00:40:45.273
Well, you're not against

1253
00:40:45.316 --> 00:40:46.143
integrated schooling, are you,

1254
00:40:46.186 --> 00:40:46.970
Bob?

1255
00:40:47.013 --> 00:40:48.145
Against it?

1256
00:40:48.188 --> 00:40:49.799
Hell, I'm for it!

1257
00:40:49.842 --> 00:40:50.756
We wouldn't be state champions

1258
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.193
without it.

1259
00:40:53.237 --> 00:40:54.282
You know, if I can speak

1260
00:40:54.325 --> 00:40:55.674
frankly... excuse me, but all of

1261
00:40:55.718 --> 00:40:56.956
this prom business... it started

1262
00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.937
after the Dawson boy got

1263
00:40:57.981 --> 00:40:59.330
suspended.

1264
00:40:59.374 --> 00:41:00.481
It is obviously a rebellion.

1265
00:41:00.505 --> 00:41:02.725
Kids want to do what they

1266
00:41:02.768 --> 00:41:04.117
know they shouldn't do.

1267
00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:05.597
That's why they're kids.

1268
00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:06.859
Putting blacks and whites

1269
00:41:06.903 --> 00:41:08.513
together on prom night?

1270
00:41:08.557 --> 00:41:09.384
Why not just give the baby

1271
00:41:09.427 --> 00:41:10.559
matches?

1272
00:41:10.602 --> 00:41:11.734
I couldn't agree more.

1273
00:41:11.777 --> 00:41:12.604
It's that Brianna

1274
00:41:12.648 --> 00:41:13.518
McCallister.

1275
00:41:13.562 --> 00:41:14.345
I mean, if you could just talk

1276
00:41:14.389 --> 00:41:15.259
to her, Jenny.

1277
00:41:15.303 --> 00:41:16.216
She's the one who started all

1278
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.566
this.

1279
00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:18.673
And Bob, you need to speak with

1280
00:41:18.697 --> 00:41:19.742
Carla.

1281
00:41:19.785 --> 00:41:20.917
Carla's just acting out.

1282
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.006
Curiosity, that's all.

1283
00:41:23.049 --> 00:41:23.876
You know, it's the kind of

1284
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.790
thing that can get out of

1285
00:41:24.834 --> 00:41:26.575
control if we just let it be.

1286
00:41:26.618 --> 00:41:27.726
I always tell my girls what my

1287
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.491
daddy always told me.

1288
00:41:29.534 --> 00:41:31.449
"Lie down with dogs, get up with

1289
00:41:31.493 --> 00:41:33.233
fleas."

1290
00:41:35.235 --> 00:41:36.062
Excuse me.

1291
00:41:36.106 --> 00:41:37.760
I need to drink.

1292
00:41:41.938 --> 00:41:45.550
Kelly!

1293
00:41:45.594 --> 00:41:48.336
I'll be right back.

1294
00:41:48.379 --> 00:41:49.859
Hey, so I got the prom

1295
00:41:49.902 --> 00:41:50.773
catalog.

1296
00:41:50.816 --> 00:41:51.817
We need to pick out the

1297
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:52.949
glassware and the napkins.

1298
00:41:52.992 --> 00:41:53.776
You want to do it during lunch?

1299
00:41:53.819 --> 00:41:54.820
I can't during lunch.

1300
00:41:54.864 --> 00:41:55.778
What about after school?

1301
00:41:55.821 --> 00:41:56.648
Um, I can't work prom

1302
00:41:56.692 --> 00:41:57.823
anymore.

1303
00:41:57.867 --> 00:41:58.737
My mom says it's just too much

1304
00:41:58.781 --> 00:41:59.888
for me, what with all my other

1305
00:41:59.912 --> 00:42:01.349
activities.

1306
00:42:01.392 --> 00:42:02.872
Ask Shannon.

1307
00:42:05.744 --> 00:42:06.919
Kelly's gone over to the dark

1308
00:42:06.963 --> 00:42:08.660
side.

1309
00:42:08.704 --> 00:42:09.922
I mean, the light side.

1310
00:42:09.966 --> 00:42:10.793
Don't you start talking about

1311
00:42:10.836 --> 00:42:11.620
sides.

1312
00:42:11.663 --> 00:42:12.490
Don't you see what's

1313
00:42:12.534 --> 00:42:15.145
happening around here?

1314
00:42:15.188 --> 00:42:16.451
Check it out.

1315
00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:25.024
Sela!

1316
00:42:25.068 --> 00:42:25.895
What?

1317
00:42:25.938 --> 00:42:26.722
You want me to feel sorry

1318
00:42:26.765 --> 00:42:28.158
for her?

1319
00:42:28.201 --> 00:42:29.115
If Myron had any sense he'd

1320
00:42:29.159 --> 00:42:30.639
be done with that white girl.

1321
00:42:30.682 --> 00:42:31.814
That white girl's name is

1322
00:42:31.857 --> 00:42:33.032
Carla.

1323
00:42:33.076 --> 00:42:34.469
No, ma'am, she's "White Bitch

1324
00:42:34.512 --> 00:42:36.209
Who Got Myron Dawson Suspended,"

1325
00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:39.822
formerly known as Carla.

1326
00:42:39.865 --> 00:42:41.171
Who's been saying that?

1327
00:42:41.214 --> 00:42:42.390
Plenty of people.

1328
00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:44.392
Including yours truly.

1329
00:42:54.097 --> 00:42:55.751
A thousand for the hotel?

1330
00:42:55.794 --> 00:42:57.143
And that's just for the deposit.

1331
00:42:57.187 --> 00:42:58.057
There's not gonna be anything

1332
00:42:58.101 --> 00:43:01.147
left for drinks or decorations.

1333
00:43:05.891 --> 00:43:07.197
Mercier Meeting Hall.

1334
00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.067
Looking good.

1335
00:43:08.111 --> 00:43:09.025
Mercier Meeting Hall,

1336
00:43:09.068 --> 00:43:10.679
kill me now.

1337
00:43:10.722 --> 00:43:11.593
Yo, what you lookin' at?

1338
00:43:11.636 --> 00:43:14.944
Yo, what you lookin' at?

1339
00:43:14.987 --> 00:43:15.945
It ain't none of your

1340
00:43:15.988 --> 00:43:16.815
business.

1341
00:43:16.859 --> 00:43:17.729
I make it my business.

1342
00:43:17.773 --> 00:43:18.643
Hey, take it easy.

1343
00:43:18.687 --> 00:43:19.557
Well, tell your boy to

1344
00:43:19.601 --> 00:43:20.689
back off.

1345
00:43:20.732 --> 00:43:22.081
No, let him go!

1346
00:43:22.125 --> 00:43:23.169
She's not worth it.

1347
00:43:23.213 --> 00:43:24.780
I'm gonna see you!

1348
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.484
Hello.

1349
00:43:33.528 --> 00:43:34.485
You're cooking?

1350
00:43:34.529 --> 00:43:35.355
I've learned a few things

1351
00:43:35.399 --> 00:43:36.226
since high school.

1352
00:43:36.269 --> 00:43:37.662
Try and keep an open mind.

1353
00:43:37.706 --> 00:43:38.576
Come on in.

1354
00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:39.490
I thought we were just gonna

1355
00:43:39.534 --> 00:43:41.449
go out for a drink.

1356
00:43:41.492 --> 00:43:42.885
Well, I'm aware of how you

1357
00:43:42.928 --> 00:43:44.495
like, hate the whole Mercier

1358
00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:45.931
staring at the black girl with

1359
00:43:45.975 --> 00:43:47.759
the white guy thing, so...

1360
00:43:47.803 --> 00:43:50.283
Gawker free zone.

1361
00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:52.372
All right.

1362
00:43:52.416 --> 00:43:54.592
It does smell good.

1363
00:43:54.636 --> 00:43:55.506
Stuffed crab.

1364
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:56.376
I got the recipe from my

1365
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.943
neighbor.

1366
00:43:57.987 --> 00:43:58.901
Would you like some wine?

1367
00:43:58.944 --> 00:44:01.033
Yes, thank you.

1368
00:44:01.077 --> 00:44:02.905
Where'd you get that apron?

1369
00:44:02.948 --> 00:44:04.254
You like it?

1370
00:44:04.297 --> 00:44:06.865
It's lovely.

1371
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:11.261
Thank you.

1372
00:44:11.304 --> 00:44:12.523
Cheers.

1373
00:44:19.661 --> 00:44:22.185
♪♪

1374
00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:39.332
Mercier is still a

1375
00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:40.440
small-minded, passive-aggressive

1376
00:44:40.464 --> 00:44:42.771
racist little town.

1377
00:44:42.814 --> 00:44:43.902
Mark, think about it.

1378
00:44:43.946 --> 00:44:44.816
Who owns most of the real estate

1379
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:45.687
here?

1380
00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.515
Who wields all of the power?

1381
00:44:47.558 --> 00:44:49.125
There's one black employee down

1382
00:44:49.168 --> 00:44:51.301
at the courthouse and 90%

1383
00:44:51.344 --> 00:44:52.955
of the inmates in the jailhouse

1384
00:44:52.998 --> 00:44:54.173
are black.

1385
00:44:54.217 --> 00:44:55.392
And yet, somehow, y'all are

1386
00:44:55.435 --> 00:44:56.567
still real proud of your

1387
00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:58.743
integrated little PTA.

1388
00:44:58.787 --> 00:45:03.574
You're right.

1389
00:45:03.618 --> 00:45:05.054
I'm sorry.

1390
00:45:05.097 --> 00:45:06.359
I... I did not
mean to go off on

1391
00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:07.622
you like that.

1392
00:45:07.665 --> 00:45:09.188
That was awful.

1393
00:45:09.232 --> 00:45:10.059
It's all right.

1394
00:45:10.102 --> 00:45:12.104
You know, dinner was lovely.

1395
00:45:12.148 --> 00:45:14.454
You... you're a great cook.

1396
00:45:14.498 --> 00:45:17.327
Thank you.

1397
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:19.851
You know, there are people

1398
00:45:19.895 --> 00:45:23.072
trying to change things here.

1399
00:45:23.115 --> 00:45:24.682
You could sign up.

1400
00:45:24.726 --> 00:45:25.596
I'm just passing through,

1401
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.510
Mark.

1402
00:45:26.554 --> 00:45:27.642
I don't have the patience.

1403
00:45:27.685 --> 00:45:28.860
I never did.

1404
00:45:28.904 --> 00:45:31.428
Prejudice is just fear.

1405
00:45:31.471 --> 00:45:33.952
People are scared.

1406
00:45:38.609 --> 00:45:40.132
Look at 'em.

1407
00:45:43.658 --> 00:45:44.920
You're right.

1408
00:45:44.963 --> 00:45:46.225
People here are scared.

1409
00:45:46.269 --> 00:45:47.226
They're scared of you, and

1410
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.315
they're scared of me, and Myron

1411
00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:50.273
and Carla, and little coffee

1412
00:45:50.316 --> 00:45:51.230
colored babies in the

1413
00:45:51.274 --> 00:45:53.189
preschools.

1414
00:45:57.149 --> 00:45:59.543
Where are you going?

1415
00:45:59.587 --> 00:46:01.023
Honestly, Mark.

1416
00:46:01.066 --> 00:46:01.893
I don't... I don't know why I

1417
00:46:01.937 --> 00:46:03.591
came here.

1418
00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:08.247
Open this door.

1419
00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:09.640
I'm not scared.

1420
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.791
I'm sorry.

1421
00:46:29.834 --> 00:46:31.793
I'm sorry.

1422
00:46:41.063 --> 00:46:42.151
So, is AP interested in the

1423
00:46:42.194 --> 00:46:44.109
story or not?

1424
00:46:46.721 --> 00:46:47.591
Great... no, that's,

1425
00:46:47.635 --> 00:46:49.593
that's great... okay.

1426
00:46:49.637 --> 00:46:51.682
Um, okay, it's... it's Mercier

1427
00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:54.511
High School and, uh, and no

1428
00:46:54.554 --> 00:46:57.035
byline, okay?

1429
00:46:57.079 --> 00:46:57.906
Yeah, the girl's name is

1430
00:46:57.949 --> 00:47:00.517
Brianna McCallister.

1431
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.912
B
-R
-I
-A
-N
-N
-A and, uh,

1432
00:47:03.955 --> 00:47:07.567
McCallister is two c's, two l's.

1433
00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:09.395
All right, you ready?

1434
00:47:09.439 --> 00:47:11.528
Okay, um, in an effort to end

1435
00:47:11.571 --> 00:47:15.401
30 years of segregated proms,

1436
00:47:15.445 --> 00:47:16.446
high school student

1437
00:47:16.489 --> 00:47:19.579
Brianna McCallister is...

1438
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:21.320
Listen up!

1439
00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:22.644
Your projects are due on Monday.

1440
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:24.236
No excuses.

1441
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.498
That means you, Ely.

1442
00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:26.978
I am wounded.

1443
00:47:27.022 --> 00:47:29.111
You are warned.

1444
00:47:31.243 --> 00:47:32.201
Hey, Miss Einstein.

1445
00:47:32.244 --> 00:47:33.115
Hey.

1446
00:47:33.158 --> 00:47:33.985
You gonna be at Lee's on

1447
00:47:34.029 --> 00:47:34.899
Friday night?

1448
00:47:34.943 --> 00:47:36.074
Uh, I don't know.

1449
00:47:36.118 --> 00:47:38.424
Be there.

1450
00:47:38.468 --> 00:47:39.991
Okay.

1451
00:47:40.035 --> 00:47:40.992
Brianna McCallister,

1452
00:47:41.036 --> 00:47:42.254
please come to the principal's

1453
00:47:42.298 --> 00:47:43.734
office.

1454
00:47:47.303 --> 00:47:49.261
Close the door, please.

1455
00:47:51.437 --> 00:47:53.439
Sit down, Brianna.

1456
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.357
Why didn't you talk to me first?

1457
00:47:58.401 --> 00:47:59.184
Talk to you?

1458
00:47:59.228 --> 00:48:01.186
About what?

1459
00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:05.451
Apparently it's in

1460
00:48:05.495 --> 00:48:07.105
all the papers.

1461
00:48:07.149 --> 00:48:08.106
Mrs. Stephens, I... I don't

1462
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:09.368
know anything about this, I...

1463
00:48:09.412 --> 00:48:10.326
I swear.

1464
00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:11.283
"At a PTA meeting,

1465
00:48:11.327 --> 00:48:12.545
Ms. McCallister protested

1466
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.591
the segregated proms.

'We're all just friends, ' the

senior said, 'we just want to

party together, what's wrong

00:48:18.682 --> 00:48:20.684
with that?'"

in Mercier."

1474
00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:26.777
I didn't call the newspapers.

1475
00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:27.952
Honest, I didn't do it.

1476
00:48:27.996 --> 00:48:29.388
This article implies that our

1477
00:48:29.432 --> 00:48:31.869
school sanctions segregation.

1478
00:48:31.913 --> 00:48:32.740
Do you realize that you've put

1479
00:48:32.783 --> 00:48:33.784
us all in a potentially

1480
00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:35.830
dangerous position?

1481
00:48:35.873 --> 00:48:36.937
Promise me that you won't talk

1482
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:38.006
to any more reporters.

1483
00:48:38.049 --> 00:48:39.007
I didn't.

1484
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.877
A television camera crew

1485
00:48:39.921 --> 00:48:42.532
is on the way over here.

1486
00:48:42.575 --> 00:48:43.707
Call the Sheriff, make sure

1487
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:45.448
they stay off school property.

1488
00:48:45.491 --> 00:48:46.275
I think it's best if you go home

1489
00:48:46.318 --> 00:48:48.190
for the rest of the day.

1490
00:48:48.233 --> 00:48:49.017
Mercier High, can you please

1491
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.758
hold?

1492
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:52.150
Mercier High, can you...

1493
00:48:52.194 --> 00:48:53.195
Please hold.

1494
00:48:53.238 --> 00:48:55.240
Thank you.

1495
00:48:55.284 --> 00:48:56.241
Mercier High, can you please

1496
00:48:56.285 --> 00:48:57.068
hold?

1497
00:48:57.112 --> 00:48:57.895
Just hold, please.

1498
00:48:57.939 --> 00:48:58.766
Please hold.

1499
00:48:58.809 --> 00:48:59.636
Hello, can I help you?

1500
00:48:59.679 --> 00:49:00.463
The prom is not a

1501
00:49:00.506 --> 00:49:01.507
school-sponsored event.

1502
00:49:01.551 --> 00:49:02.465
They're private parties.

1503
00:49:02.508 --> 00:49:04.119
The school can't afford a prom.

1504
00:49:04.162 --> 00:49:05.120
I'm sorry, the school has no

1505
00:49:05.163 --> 00:49:05.947
comment.

1506
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.861
No comment.

1507
00:49:06.904 --> 00:49:07.731
No comment.

1508
00:49:07.775 --> 00:49:09.820
No comment.

1509
00:49:09.864 --> 00:49:10.821
Brianna!

1510
00:49:10.865 --> 00:49:12.867
Hey, Brianna!

1511
00:49:35.019 --> 00:49:38.718
Brianna, where are you going?

1512
00:49:38.762 --> 00:49:40.764
I've been sent home.

1513
00:49:40.808 --> 00:49:42.635
Why?

1514
00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:44.986
You know why.

1515
00:49:49.991 --> 00:49:51.906
Brianna, oh, come on, honey.

1516
00:49:51.949 --> 00:49:52.863
Wait.

1517
00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:55.126
Brianna, wait.

1518
00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:56.780
Wait a second.

1519
00:49:56.824 --> 00:49:58.260
You lied to me.

1520
00:49:58.303 --> 00:49:59.914
No, I did not lie.

1521
00:49:59.957 --> 00:50:00.871
You wrote that story,

1522
00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:02.220
didn't you?

1523
00:50:02.264 --> 00:50:03.091
Yes, I did.

1524
00:50:03.134 --> 00:50:04.179
And you asked me questions

1525
00:50:04.222 --> 00:50:05.615
and pretended like we were

1526
00:50:05.658 --> 00:50:06.679
friends, so that you could have

1527
00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:09.967
a story.

1528
00:50:10.011 --> 00:50:12.230
You don't call that a lie?

1529
00:50:17.279 --> 00:50:18.149
Why'd you give it to the

1530
00:50:18.193 --> 00:50:20.108
Associated Press?

1531
00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:20.978
Afraid to put your name

1532
00:50:21.022 --> 00:50:22.414
on it?

1533
00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:23.478
No, I should've just told her

1534
00:50:23.502 --> 00:50:24.895
it was coming out before it did,

1535
00:50:24.939 --> 00:50:25.809
that's all.

1536
00:50:25.853 --> 00:50:27.593
That's all.

1537
00:50:27.637 --> 00:50:28.856
You used her, Dez.

1538
00:50:28.899 --> 00:50:29.857
I helped her, Mark.

1539
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.858
I gave her a voice.

1540
00:50:30.901 --> 00:50:31.771
You're the one that told me to

1541
00:50:31.815 --> 00:50:32.642
sign up.

1542
00:50:32.685 --> 00:50:33.904
That's how you sign up?

1543
00:50:33.948 --> 00:50:35.732
By publicly shaming this town?

1544
00:50:35.775 --> 00:50:37.560
This town should be shamed...

1545
00:50:37.603 --> 00:50:38.387
Publicly, privately and any

1546
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:39.997
other way I can think of.

1547
00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:41.061
Well, mission accomplished.

1548
00:50:41.085 --> 00:50:43.218
You can go back to New Orleans.

1549
00:50:43.261 --> 00:50:44.088
I bet you'll get some real juicy

1550
00:50:44.132 --> 00:50:46.786
assignments out of this.

1551
00:50:57.319 --> 00:50:58.233
Sending Brianna McCallister

1552
00:50:58.276 --> 00:50:59.103
home, was that really necessary,

1553
00:50:59.147 --> 00:51:00.191
Jenny?

1554
00:51:00.235 --> 00:51:01.062
I couldn't have her here with

1555
00:51:01.105 --> 00:51:02.541
all the television cameras.

1556
00:51:02.585 --> 00:51:03.412
Well, you can't keep her out

1557
00:51:03.455 --> 00:51:04.326
of school.

1558
00:51:04.369 --> 00:51:05.414
I know, I know.

1559
00:51:05.457 --> 00:51:06.241
I thought you were in favor

1560
00:51:06.284 --> 00:51:07.155
of one prom.

1561
00:51:07.198 --> 00:51:08.460
I'm not in favor of being

1562
00:51:08.504 --> 00:51:10.549
called a, a passive-aggressive

1563
00:51:10.593 --> 00:51:12.638
white racist just because this

1564
00:51:12.682 --> 00:51:13.813
town has a tradition of two

1565
00:51:13.857 --> 00:51:15.511
separate proms.

1566
00:51:15.554 --> 00:51:17.382
Segregated, not separate.

1567
00:51:17.426 --> 00:51:18.253
Why does everyone keep using

1568
00:51:18.296 --> 00:51:19.123
that word?

1569
00:51:19.167 --> 00:51:21.343
Mr. Thornton's here.

1570
00:51:24.607 --> 00:51:25.738
Who's minding the store,

1571
00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:27.827
Jenny?

1572
00:51:27.871 --> 00:51:28.935
How'd this little girl get so

1573
00:51:28.959 --> 00:51:30.439
much press?

1574
00:51:30.482 --> 00:51:32.006
We don't know.

1575
00:51:32.049 --> 00:51:32.920
You think the NAACP's behind

1576
00:51:32.963 --> 00:51:34.399
this?

1577
00:51:34.443 --> 00:51:35.618
I don't believe so.

1578
00:51:35.661 --> 00:51:36.532
Well, you and I have to do

1579
00:51:36.575 --> 00:51:37.683
some damage control before they

1580
00:51:37.707 --> 00:51:38.969
jump on the bandwagon.

1581
00:51:39.013 --> 00:51:42.277
Well, it's an easy fix, Bob.

1582
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.582
Beg your pardon, Mark?

1583
00:51:43.626 --> 00:51:44.496
Well, you just have Jenny

1584
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.280
announce that there's gonna be

1585
00:51:45.323 --> 00:51:46.194
one prom.

1586
00:51:46.237 --> 00:51:47.064
Black and white kids together

1587
00:51:47.108 --> 00:51:47.978
and then there's nothing to

1588
00:51:48.022 --> 00:51:49.023
write about.

1589
00:51:49.066 --> 00:51:49.980
Are you being smart with me

1590
00:51:50.024 --> 00:51:51.721
or are you just dumb as a post?

1591
00:51:51.764 --> 00:51:55.333
I'm just being practical.

1592
00:51:55.377 --> 00:51:56.291
Jenny?

1593
00:51:56.334 --> 00:51:58.554
Mark.

1594
00:52:06.649 --> 00:52:08.042
Prom is going to be like it's

1595
00:52:08.085 --> 00:52:09.826
always been for one reason and

1596
00:52:09.869 --> 00:52:11.001
one reason only.

1597
00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:11.915
That's the way the students

1598
00:52:11.959 --> 00:52:12.916
want it.

1599
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.570
We have to make that very clear.

1600
00:52:14.613 --> 00:52:16.006
Now, this McCallister girl,

1601
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.007
it says in the paper she's

1602
00:52:17.051 --> 00:52:18.704
the valedictorian.

1603
00:52:18.748 --> 00:52:20.271
She's in the running, yeah.

1604
00:52:20.315 --> 00:52:21.490
Does she want to stay in the

1605
00:52:21.533 --> 00:52:23.318
running?

1606
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:24.425
I hope you're not suggesting

1607
00:52:24.449 --> 00:52:26.277
that I use that as a threat.

1608
00:52:26.321 --> 00:52:27.191
Oh, no.

1609
00:52:27.235 --> 00:52:28.018
I'm not telling you how to do

1610
00:52:28.062 --> 00:52:28.976
your job, Jenny.

1611
00:52:29.019 --> 00:52:30.107
You're doing a fine job.

1612
00:52:30.151 --> 00:52:31.587
Now, a lot of folks on the board

1613
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:32.588
didn't think we should have a

1614
00:52:32.631 --> 00:52:33.545
woman principal, but me, I stuck

1615
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:35.852
out my neck.

1616
00:52:35.895 --> 00:52:37.419
I said, "She has brass ones."

1617
00:52:40.639 --> 00:52:42.032
Please, don't make me out to be

1618
00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:45.775
a big fat liar.

1619
00:52:45.818 --> 00:52:47.037
She doesn't want to talk

1620
00:52:47.081 --> 00:52:48.430
to you.

1621
00:52:48.473 --> 00:52:49.909
I didn't do it to hurt her.

1622
00:52:49.953 --> 00:52:53.043
Marlene.

1623
00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:54.566
Please.

1624
00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:55.437
You said you'd die before

1625
00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.351
you'd set foot in this town

1626
00:52:56.394 --> 00:52:57.482
again.

1627
00:52:57.526 --> 00:52:58.831
Well, here you are.

1628
00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:00.529
Come to teach us a lesson.

1629
00:53:00.572 --> 00:53:01.399
You may not like how I did

1630
00:53:01.443 --> 00:53:02.487
it, but you know it needed

1631
00:53:02.531 --> 00:53:03.358
doing.

1632
00:53:03.401 --> 00:53:04.185
Brianna did what needed

1633
00:53:04.228 --> 00:53:05.316
doing.

1634
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.101
You just wrote it up.

1635
00:53:07.144 --> 00:53:08.580
All right.

1636
00:53:08.624 --> 00:53:09.625
Fair enough.

1637
00:53:09.668 --> 00:53:10.539
You think you're the only

1638
00:53:10.582 --> 00:53:11.279
person in this town that wanted

1639
00:53:11.322 --> 00:53:13.629
more?

1640
00:53:21.376 --> 00:53:22.899
Thank you.

1641
00:53:34.345 --> 00:53:36.695
So?

1642
00:53:36.739 --> 00:53:38.523
You just gonna give up now?

1643
00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:46.923
You know that saying, "the tip

1644
00:53:46.966 --> 00:53:48.751
of the iceberg"?

1645
00:53:48.794 --> 00:53:49.882
That's your prom.

1646
00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:51.232
No, it wasn't an iceberg

1647
00:53:51.275 --> 00:53:52.668
until you made it one.

1648
00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:53.886
Honey, it was an iceberg and

1649
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:54.844
you would've hit sooner or later

1650
00:53:54.887 --> 00:53:58.065
and I only made it sooner.

1651
00:53:58.108 --> 00:53:58.891
Now, what're you gonna do?

1652
00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:01.372
Nothing!

1653
00:54:01.416 --> 00:54:02.504
It's over.

1654
00:54:02.547 --> 00:54:03.635
It's far from over.

1655
00:54:03.679 --> 00:54:05.376
It's your game now.

1656
00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.899
You and your church ladies and

1657
00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.118
your reporters and the City

1658
00:54:08.162 --> 00:54:10.033
Council, and anybody else who

1659
00:54:10.077 --> 00:54:12.427
wants to use us to make a point.

1660
00:54:15.169 --> 00:54:17.084
Oh, this isn't what I wanted.

1661
00:54:17.127 --> 00:54:17.954
You started something,

1662
00:54:17.997 --> 00:54:18.868
Brianna.

1663
00:54:18.911 --> 00:54:19.695
Now you gotta see it through.

1664
00:54:19.738 --> 00:54:20.652
Why?

1665
00:54:20.696 --> 00:54:21.566
So you can have more to write

1666
00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:23.438
about?

1667
00:54:23.481 --> 00:54:24.308
Come on.

1668
00:54:24.352 --> 00:54:26.093
You're not fair.

1669
00:54:27.268 --> 00:54:29.618
Neither are you.

1670
00:54:33.578 --> 00:54:35.667
Now, I wish you'd leave.

1671
00:54:48.506 --> 00:54:50.378
You know, when I look at you,

1672
00:54:50.421 --> 00:54:51.529
I wonder what I might've done

1673
00:54:51.553 --> 00:54:53.294
when I was your age.

1674
00:54:53.337 --> 00:54:55.774
If I'd had your imagination and

1675
00:54:55.818 --> 00:54:59.038
your courage.

1676
00:54:59.082 --> 00:55:01.563
But I didn't.

1677
00:55:01.606 --> 00:55:03.347
I just ran away.

1678
00:55:17.492 --> 00:55:18.928
I made you a sandwich.

1679
00:55:18.971 --> 00:55:21.148
I'm not hungry.

1680
00:55:21.191 --> 00:55:21.974
Now, come on, eat something,

1681
00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:23.672
sweetie.

1682
00:55:23.715 --> 00:55:24.542
Trouble doesn't like an

1683
00:55:24.586 --> 00:55:25.891
empty stomach.

1684
00:55:25.935 --> 00:55:26.805
You told me to keep my head

1685
00:55:26.849 --> 00:55:28.198
down.

1686
00:55:28.242 --> 00:55:29.156
That's right, I did,

1687
00:55:29.199 --> 00:55:30.331
didn't I?

1688
00:55:30.374 --> 00:55:31.201
I should have listened

1689
00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:32.898
to you.

1690
00:55:32.942 --> 00:55:34.813
I should've listened to you.

1691
00:55:34.857 --> 00:55:36.467
Come here.

1692
00:55:36.511 --> 00:55:38.948
Shh, it's okay.

1693
00:55:44.258 --> 00:55:47.435
You know about Ernest Armstrong?

1694
00:55:47.478 --> 00:55:48.499
All that reading and you don't

1695
00:55:48.523 --> 00:55:50.525
know about your own relations.

1696
00:55:50.568 --> 00:55:52.657
Let's see, Ernest.

1697
00:55:52.701 --> 00:55:53.528
Third cousin on my mother's

1698
00:55:53.571 --> 00:55:55.443
side.

1699
00:55:55.486 --> 00:55:56.835
Now, Ernest was the first black

1700
00:55:56.879 --> 00:55:58.750
man in Louisiana to cast his

1701
00:55:58.794 --> 00:56:03.364
ballot in a national election.

1702
00:56:03.407 --> 00:56:04.278
He was the first black man

1703
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:05.148
to vote?

1704
00:56:05.192 --> 00:56:08.760
Mm-hmm.

1705
00:56:08.804 --> 00:56:10.022
'course, his vote wasn't

1706
00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.241
counted.

1707
00:56:11.285 --> 00:56:13.025
Of course.

1708
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:16.551
And they lynched him.

1709
00:56:16.594 --> 00:56:18.683
But the point is, he went first.

1710
00:56:18.727 --> 00:56:20.250
Now, somebody's got to go first,

1711
00:56:20.294 --> 00:56:21.164
like you.

1712
00:56:21.208 --> 00:56:22.121
What?

1713
00:56:22.165 --> 00:56:22.948
Are you saying I'm gonna be

1714
00:56:22.992 --> 00:56:23.906
lynched?

1715
00:56:23.949 --> 00:56:27.518
No, girl, no.

1716
00:56:27.562 --> 00:56:29.868
What I'm trying to say is,

1717
00:56:29.912 --> 00:56:31.261
I'm proud to be related to you,

1718
00:56:31.305 --> 00:56:33.350
Brianna.

1719
00:56:33.394 --> 00:56:34.501
Now, it was wrong for me to tell

1720
00:56:34.525 --> 00:56:36.875
you to keep your head down.

1721
00:56:36.919 --> 00:56:38.268
You keep your head up.

1722
00:56:38.312 --> 00:56:40.836
You know what you're doing.

1723
00:56:40.879 --> 00:56:41.880
Okay?

1724
00:56:41.924 --> 00:56:43.578
Okay.

1725
00:56:46.581 --> 00:56:47.451
You told me to take some

1726
00:56:47.495 --> 00:56:48.496
personal time.

1727
00:56:48.539 --> 00:56:49.932
This is personal.

1728
00:56:49.975 --> 00:56:51.063
Point taken.

1729
00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:52.500
Personal leave is over.

1730
00:56:52.543 --> 00:56:53.544
You work for me.

1731
00:56:53.588 --> 00:56:54.937
You do not file with Associated

1732
00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.025
Press...

1733
00:56:56.068 --> 00:56:56.982
Unless you want me to send

1734
00:56:57.026 --> 00:56:58.133
Fatboy down there to break your

1735
00:56:58.157 --> 00:56:59.376
kneecaps.

1736
00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:00.638
How's Mom, how's Dad, how's

1737
00:57:00.682 --> 00:57:01.596
the dog?

1738
00:57:01.639 --> 00:57:02.901
That's good.

1739
00:57:02.945 --> 00:57:03.772
When's prom?

1740
00:57:03.815 --> 00:57:04.816
It's May 18th.

1741
00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:05.730
Stay and cover it.

1742
00:57:05.774 --> 00:57:07.297
Pre-prom, prom, racist

1743
00:57:07.341 --> 00:57:09.256
rednecks, kids, parents.

1744
00:57:09.299 --> 00:57:10.387
Maybe somebody'll burn down

1745
00:57:10.431 --> 00:57:13.216
the school if we're lucky.

1746
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.827
You there?

1747
00:57:15.871 --> 00:57:17.612
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

1748
00:57:17.655 --> 00:57:18.482
You wanted off the

1749
00:57:18.526 --> 00:57:19.527
Metro Section.

1750
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:21.311
This is it, congratulations.

1751
00:57:21.355 --> 00:57:25.272
You're a front pager.

1752
00:57:25.315 --> 00:57:27.056
Hello?

1753
00:57:27.099 --> 00:57:29.580
You do want this, don't you?

1754
00:57:29.624 --> 00:57:30.755
Yeah.

1755
00:57:30.799 --> 00:57:33.105
Yeah, I want it.

1756
00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:34.237
I'm sending a photographer.

1757
00:57:34.281 --> 00:57:36.500
Hugs and kisses.

1758
00:58:01.133 --> 00:58:01.960
We're your Secret Service

1759
00:58:02.004 --> 00:58:02.874
bodyguards.

1760
00:58:02.918 --> 00:58:03.745
Oh, I need bodyguards?

1761
00:58:03.788 --> 00:58:05.529
Mm-hmm, you famous.

1762
00:58:05.573 --> 00:58:06.443
You're like a rap star.

1763
00:58:06.487 --> 00:58:07.357
You ever seen a rap star without

1764
00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:08.227
a bodyguard?

1765
00:58:08.271 --> 00:58:09.054
Uh-uh.

1766
00:58:09.098 --> 00:58:10.795
I am a human shield.

1767
00:58:10.839 --> 00:58:13.363
You're not a human anything.

1768
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:14.669
We got your back, Bree.

1769
00:58:14.712 --> 00:58:16.584
We got your back.

1770
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:27.812
Brianna.

1771
00:58:27.856 --> 00:58:29.379
Can I have my prom dues back?

1772
00:58:29.423 --> 00:58:30.337
What world are you in?

1773
00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.381
No refunds.

1774
00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:32.295
Carla, you're not coming to

1775
00:58:32.339 --> 00:58:33.209
prom?

1776
00:58:33.252 --> 00:58:34.123
My dad says there's not gonna

1777
00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:35.516
be a prom.

1778
00:58:35.559 --> 00:58:36.691
Just a white prom.

1779
00:58:36.734 --> 00:58:38.127
And I'm not going to that.

1780
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.041
Oh, so you're gonna have a

1781
00:58:39.084 --> 00:58:41.783
private party at no-tell motel?

1782
00:58:41.826 --> 00:58:43.654
Sela, stop it.

1783
00:58:43.698 --> 00:58:44.718
Ask white prom for your dues,

1784
00:58:44.742 --> 00:58:45.569
okay?

1785
00:58:45.613 --> 00:58:46.440
Shannon said Brianna was

1786
00:58:46.483 --> 00:58:47.615
holding the dues.

1787
00:58:47.658 --> 00:58:48.529
And we spent it!

1788
00:58:48.572 --> 00:58:49.593
You couldn't have spent all

1789
00:58:49.617 --> 00:58:50.618
that money.

1790
00:58:50.661 --> 00:58:52.359
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1791
00:58:52.402 --> 00:58:53.708
Are you saying she stole your

1792
00:58:53.751 --> 00:58:54.665
money, ho?

1793
00:58:54.709 --> 00:58:55.579
What'd you call me?

1794
00:58:55.623 --> 00:58:56.450
Oh, we got a cat fight.

1795
00:58:56.493 --> 00:58:57.407
Stop it.

1796
00:58:57.451 --> 00:58:58.669
Stop it, both of you.

1797
00:58:58.713 --> 00:58:59.583
White ho.

1798
00:58:59.627 --> 00:59:00.454
Stop it, Carla,

1799
00:59:00.497 --> 00:59:01.497
we've got class.

1800
00:59:02.369 --> 00:59:03.631
I can take care of myself.

1801
00:59:03.674 --> 00:59:05.589
You better watch it, ho.

1802
00:59:05.633 --> 00:59:08.810
That was the bell, people.

1803
00:59:08.853 --> 00:59:10.377
Brianna.

1804
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.987
In my office, please.

1805
00:59:15.425 --> 00:59:19.211
Brianna, if I was harsh with

1806
00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:24.216
you yesterday... I'm sorry.

1807
00:59:25.783 --> 00:59:26.654
It's okay, ma'am.

1808
00:59:26.697 --> 00:59:28.917
I understand.

1809
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.571
It's just that the school and

1810
00:59:30.614 --> 00:59:32.181
graduation parties are two

1811
00:59:32.224 --> 00:59:34.357
separate things.

1812
00:59:34.401 --> 00:59:36.968
Prom is not my business.

1813
00:59:39.362 --> 00:59:42.060
Do you trust me, Brianna?

1814
00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:44.367
Yes, ma'am.

1815
00:59:44.411 --> 00:59:45.368
Then consider some advice

1816
00:59:45.412 --> 00:59:49.154
from a friend.

1817
00:59:49.198 --> 00:59:50.547
It would be better for everyone

1818
00:59:50.591 --> 00:59:52.114
involved if the seniors had the

1819
00:59:52.157 --> 00:59:54.421
traditional two proms.

1820
00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.080
It's not just up to me.

1821
01:00:02.124 --> 01:00:03.125
Well, it's not worth

1822
01:00:03.168 --> 01:00:04.822
upsetting a whole town over

1823
01:00:04.866 --> 01:00:08.609
something as trivial as a party.

1824
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.488
I have to think about it.

1825
01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:21.360
You're an adult now.

1826
01:00:21.404 --> 01:00:22.579
You have to put aside your

1827
01:00:22.623 --> 01:00:24.276
personal wishes and think about

1828
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.498
what's best for your community.

1829
01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:31.545
You know, part of what goes into

1830
01:00:31.588 --> 01:00:33.503
being class valedictorian is

1831
01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:34.461
having a record of good

1832
01:00:34.504 --> 01:00:36.898
citizenship.

1833
01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.780
I... I understand.

1834
01:00:49.824 --> 01:00:51.608
Good.

1835
01:00:51.652 --> 01:00:53.697
You get back to class.

1836
01:01:03.881 --> 01:01:05.579
What did the Principal want?

1837
01:01:05.622 --> 01:01:06.536
She said that she wanted us

1838
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.190
to go back to the two proms.

1839
01:01:08.233 --> 01:01:10.932
That, uh, that I should stop

1840
01:01:10.975 --> 01:01:13.064
thinking about what I wanted and

1841
01:01:13.108 --> 01:01:14.979
do what's best for Mercier.

1842
01:01:15.023 --> 01:01:17.068
So, what are you gonna do?

1843
01:01:19.984 --> 01:01:20.898
Hey, everybody, shut up!

1844
01:01:20.942 --> 01:01:21.812
Listen up, girl...

1845
01:01:21.856 --> 01:01:23.553
That's you too, Reggie.

1846
01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:24.772
Now, listen up.

1847
01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:25.860
Y'all read it in the paper

1848
01:01:25.903 --> 01:01:27.601
and saw it on TV.

1849
01:01:27.644 --> 01:01:28.515
People are trying to twist

1850
01:01:28.558 --> 01:01:29.622
things around and make us seem

1851
01:01:29.646 --> 01:01:30.560
like we're something that

1852
01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.040
we're not.

1853
01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:33.041
We've always had two proms here

1854
01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:34.129
in Mercier.

1855
01:01:34.172 --> 01:01:35.367
And when we voted to have one,

1856
01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:38.307
we didn't plan...

1857
01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:42.572
I... I didn't plan on having any

1858
01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.182
troubles with anybody.

1859
01:01:44.226 --> 01:01:45.420
But now everybody is fighting,

1860
01:01:45.444 --> 01:01:48.360
y'all.

1861
01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.754
Mrs. Stephens said that I needed

1862
01:01:50.798 --> 01:01:54.105
to do the right thing for my

1863
01:01:54.149 --> 01:01:55.542
community.

1864
01:01:55.585 --> 01:01:57.979
The right thing is to have a

1865
01:01:58.022 --> 01:01:59.981
great prom.

1866
01:02:00.024 --> 01:02:00.938
And to have a great prom,

1867
01:02:00.982 --> 01:02:02.244
everybody has to be there.

1868
01:02:02.287 --> 01:02:06.074
One prom for the whole class.

1869
01:02:10.818 --> 01:02:12.515
I need my dues back.

1870
01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:13.385
Kelly, but you...

1871
01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:14.648
We're gonna have our prom

1872
01:02:14.691 --> 01:02:15.605
like always, so just give me

1873
01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:16.475
back my dues.

1874
01:02:16.519 --> 01:02:17.346
Don't ruin it for the rest

1875
01:02:17.389 --> 01:02:18.826
of us.

1876
01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:19.957
Okay.

1877
01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:20.828
Y'all want your dues back, you

1878
01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:23.221
gotta get it after school.

1879
01:02:23.265 --> 01:02:26.747
Hey!

1880
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:27.661
What you all think, she's got in

1881
01:02:27.704 --> 01:02:29.663
her pocket like a cash machine?

1882
01:02:29.706 --> 01:02:30.707
She said after school.

1883
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:32.361
Now, back off.

1884
01:02:32.404 --> 01:02:34.363
Thanks.

1885
01:02:37.627 --> 01:02:38.585
Hey...

1886
01:02:38.628 --> 01:02:40.108
I told you I owed you one.

1887
01:02:40.151 --> 01:02:41.936
You want your dues back too?

1888
01:02:41.979 --> 01:02:44.025
Keep 'em.

1889
01:02:44.068 --> 01:02:45.940
Okay.

1890
01:02:45.983 --> 01:02:47.419
That took guts in there.

1891
01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:48.246
Did you see my knees were

1892
01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:49.639
shaking?

1893
01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:51.162
I got a quote for you.

1894
01:02:51.206 --> 01:02:52.729
Okay.

1895
01:02:52.773 --> 01:02:53.817
"There can be no courage

1896
01:02:53.861 --> 01:02:55.689
unless you're scared."

1897
01:02:55.732 --> 01:02:56.646
Nice.

1898
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:57.560
You know who said that?

1899
01:02:57.604 --> 01:02:58.517
No.

1900
01:02:58.561 --> 01:02:59.388
Eddie Rickenbacker.

1901
01:02:59.431 --> 01:03:01.346
World War I flyer.

1902
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:02.870
I got another one for you.

1903
01:03:02.913 --> 01:03:03.697
I bet you don't know who

1904
01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.569
said this.

1905
01:03:06.613 --> 01:03:08.310
"If your head is waxed, don't

1906
01:03:08.353 --> 01:03:09.528
walk in the sun."

1907
01:03:09.572 --> 01:03:10.399
If your head is made of,

1908
01:03:10.442 --> 01:03:11.313
of wax.

1909
01:03:11.356 --> 01:03:12.357
Don't walk in the sun.

1910
01:03:12.401 --> 01:03:13.315
Okay.

1911
01:03:13.358 --> 01:03:14.229
Look, I'm gonna tell you who

1912
01:03:14.272 --> 01:03:15.186
said it at Lee's, but you gotta

1913
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:17.188
dance with me first, all right?

1914
01:03:17.232 --> 01:03:18.146
If I have to, I have to.

1915
01:03:18.189 --> 01:03:19.713
And then after that, maybe

1916
01:03:19.756 --> 01:03:20.670
you could school me in

1917
01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.498
chapter six.

1918
01:03:25.066 --> 01:03:27.155
I'd school you.

1919
01:03:27.198 --> 01:03:27.982
Man, you ain't gotta dance with

1920
01:03:28.025 --> 01:03:30.375
me first.

1921
01:03:30.419 --> 01:03:31.246
Don't you dance,

1922
01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:34.162
Miss Einstein?

1923
01:03:34.205 --> 01:03:36.555
Well, maybe I can school you.

1924
01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:48.829
All visitors to the school

1925
01:03:48.872 --> 01:03:49.893
need to be cleared through me.

1926
01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:50.787
We're barring the media from

1927
01:03:50.831 --> 01:03:52.659
school grounds.

1928
01:03:52.702 --> 01:03:53.660
Come on, Mark.

1929
01:03:53.703 --> 01:03:55.400
I saw a story and I wrote it.

1930
01:03:55.444 --> 01:03:56.314
Really?

1931
01:03:56.358 --> 01:03:57.098
I thought a reporter's job was

1932
01:03:57.141 --> 01:03:58.490
to report the facts.

1933
01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.057
The fact is that you people

1934
01:04:00.101 --> 01:04:02.059
use the word "tradition" when

1935
01:04:02.103 --> 01:04:03.167
the word you should be using is

1936
01:04:03.191 --> 01:04:05.715
oppression.

1937
01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:06.977
"You people"?

1938
01:04:07.021 --> 01:04:07.804
I really need to talk to

1939
01:04:07.848 --> 01:04:09.501
Brianna, okay?

1940
01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:12.156
Does she want to talk to you?

1941
01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:16.813
I have to write this story.

1942
01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:19.033
It's good for my career and,

1943
01:04:19.076 --> 01:04:20.774
honestly, it's, it's good for my

1944
01:04:20.817 --> 01:04:21.731
soul.

1945
01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:22.601
But I'd rather do it with you

1946
01:04:22.645 --> 01:04:25.692
than without you.

1947
01:04:25.735 --> 01:04:27.041
And if I say no, the paper's

1948
01:04:27.084 --> 01:04:29.608
just gonna send someone else.

1949
01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:32.742
Thank you for bringing me

1950
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:35.963
here.

1951
01:04:36.006 --> 01:04:36.920
I must've looked at these a

1952
01:04:36.964 --> 01:04:40.010
hundred times.

1953
01:04:40.054 --> 01:04:41.161
You know, I never knew why there

1954
01:04:41.185 --> 01:04:44.362
were two.

1955
01:04:44.406 --> 01:04:46.147
There just were.

1956
01:04:50.847 --> 01:04:51.868
I had to refund a bunch of prom

1957
01:04:51.892 --> 01:04:53.937
dues at school today.

1958
01:04:53.981 --> 01:04:55.001
And Kelly said I was ruining it

1959
01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:56.331
for everybody.

1960
01:04:56.374 --> 01:04:57.395
People say stupid things when

1961
01:04:57.419 --> 01:04:58.768
they feel threatened.

1962
01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:00.596
Mrs. Stephens told me not to

1963
01:05:00.639 --> 01:05:01.466
talk to any reporters.

1964
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:02.554
I know that.

1965
01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:03.512
But I want to talk to you,

1966
01:05:03.555 --> 01:05:04.426
Desiree.

1967
01:05:04.469 --> 01:05:05.620
I want you to tell the story.

1968
01:05:05.644 --> 01:05:06.471
I just don't know how it's gonna

1969
01:05:06.515 --> 01:05:07.951
turn out.

1970
01:05:07.995 --> 01:05:09.779
Prom or no prom, you have

1971
01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:10.954
made your point.

1972
01:05:10.998 --> 01:05:12.062
You do not have to take this

1973
01:05:12.086 --> 01:05:13.914
to the finish line.

1974
01:05:16.568 --> 01:05:18.919
Yes, I do.

1975
01:05:18.962 --> 01:05:20.790
Daddy, this is a huge story.

1976
01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.270
I can't just shine it on.

1977
01:05:22.313 --> 01:05:23.334
Don't you have any thought

1978
01:05:23.358 --> 01:05:24.359
for your mother?

1979
01:05:24.402 --> 01:05:25.621
She works at that school.

1980
01:05:25.664 --> 01:05:26.578
I'm not the only reporter

1981
01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:27.666
covering this.

1982
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:28.624
But you are the only reporter

1983
01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:29.843
I see in my house.

1984
01:05:29.886 --> 01:05:30.757
And in my house, I make the

1985
01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.019
rules.

1986
01:05:32.062 --> 01:05:32.933
You want to be a reporter,

1987
01:05:32.976 --> 01:05:33.934
you go stay in that motel with

1988
01:05:33.977 --> 01:05:35.283
the rest of 'em.

1989
01:05:35.326 --> 01:05:36.197
Fine.

1990
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.633
I'll go get my things.

1991
01:05:37.676 --> 01:05:39.156
Nobody is going anywhere.

1992
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.593
Now stop it, both of you.

1993
01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.770
Mama, am I making problems

1994
01:05:43.813 --> 01:05:44.901
for you at work?

1995
01:05:44.945 --> 01:05:46.120
Nobody is giving me any

1996
01:05:46.163 --> 01:05:47.077
trouble.

1997
01:05:47.121 --> 01:05:48.228
They don't give you trouble,

1998
01:05:48.252 --> 01:05:49.340
they give you pink slips.

1999
01:05:49.384 --> 01:05:50.515
Can we just have a nice

2000
01:05:50.559 --> 01:05:51.603
dinner?

2001
01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:52.667
Now, I got your favorite shrimp

2002
01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:53.518
dish, I got some egg

2003
01:05:53.562 --> 01:05:54.389
rolls and...

2004
01:05:54.432 --> 01:05:55.303
There are other people in

2005
01:05:55.346 --> 01:05:56.957
this world besides you, Desiree.

2006
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:57.871
Now, you may not want to live

2007
01:05:57.914 --> 01:05:59.611
here, but we do.

2008
01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:00.830
Mercier is our home.

2009
01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:01.831
Oh, yeah, and the niggers in

2010
01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:02.701
Mercier don't want trouble.

2011
01:06:02.745 --> 01:06:03.920
Now, wait a minute, hold on.

2012
01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:04.834
The niggers in Mercier are

2013
01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:05.942
good neighbors and the niggers

2014
01:06:05.966 --> 01:06:06.836
in Mercier say yessuh

2015
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.750
and nossuh!

2016
01:06:07.794 --> 01:06:08.795
Would you hold on!

2017
01:06:08.838 --> 01:06:09.752
Don't you use that kind of

2018
01:06:09.796 --> 01:06:10.666
language around me.

2019
01:06:10.709 --> 01:06:11.754
Daddy, did you think that

2020
01:06:11.798 --> 01:06:12.581
Sheriff Taylor is ever gonna

2021
01:06:12.624 --> 01:06:14.191
bust that Dupree girl for

2022
01:06:14.235 --> 01:06:15.105
reckless driving?

2023
01:06:15.149 --> 01:06:16.213
She ran a stop sign, she fled

2024
01:06:16.237 --> 01:06:17.281
the scene of an accident.

2025
01:06:17.325 --> 01:06:19.109
He said he's looking into it.

2026
01:06:19.153 --> 01:06:20.197
He's looking into it!

2027
01:06:20.241 --> 01:06:21.633
Come on, Daddy.

2028
01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:22.785
He knows he doesn't have to do

2029
01:06:22.809 --> 01:06:23.916
a damn thing because you are

2030
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:25.028
a good...

2031
01:06:25.072 --> 01:06:27.639
Desiree.

2032
01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:30.033
Now, you apologize right now.

2033
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:37.432
I'm sorry, Daddy.

2034
01:06:49.966 --> 01:06:52.490
He is your father.

2035
01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:04.154
Mrs. Howard?

2036
01:07:04.198 --> 01:07:05.112
When are they gonna announce the

2037
01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:06.983
valedictorian?

2038
01:07:07.027 --> 01:07:08.855
Shouldn't you be in class?

2039
01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:13.076
Yes, ma'am.

2040
01:07:28.135 --> 01:07:29.832
Come in.

2041
01:07:34.228 --> 01:07:35.446
Brianna McCallister was

2042
01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:36.708
checking the senior class

2043
01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:37.927
bulletin.

2044
01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:39.165
Wanted to know when you're going

2045
01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:43.150
to announce class valedictorian.

2046
01:07:48.285 --> 01:07:49.069
Did you want to say

2047
01:07:49.112 --> 01:07:51.985
something, Edna?

2048
01:07:52.028 --> 01:07:55.858
Yes.

2049
01:07:55.902 --> 01:07:59.644
I think this whole thing stinks.

2050
01:07:59.688 --> 01:08:03.344
Off the record, I agree.

2051
01:08:03.387 --> 01:08:04.345
Maybe you should get on the

2052
01:08:04.388 --> 01:08:06.782
record.

2053
01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:10.220
I'm not sure what I'm

2054
01:08:10.264 --> 01:08:11.613
gonna do.

2055
01:08:17.097 --> 01:08:19.490
Thanks for your input, Edna.

2056
01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.066
I don't think I'm gonna be

2057
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:31.938
valedictorian.

2058
01:08:36.072 --> 01:08:39.554
Well, why's that?

2059
01:08:39.597 --> 01:08:40.424
Because I didn't listen to

2060
01:08:40.468 --> 01:08:41.295
what Ms. Stephens said about

2061
01:08:41.338 --> 01:08:43.645
that prom.

2062
01:08:43.688 --> 01:08:44.472
There's never been a black

2063
01:08:44.515 --> 01:08:48.476
valedictorian at Mercier.

2064
01:08:48.519 --> 01:08:49.303
If it wasn't prom, she would've

2065
01:08:49.346 --> 01:08:51.305
found another excuse.

2066
01:08:51.348 --> 01:08:52.219
This whole week has just been

2067
01:08:52.262 --> 01:08:54.569
the worst week of my life.

2068
01:08:54.612 --> 01:08:55.676
The prom is falling apart, I'm

2069
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.267
not gonna be valedictorian, half

2070
01:08:57.311 --> 01:08:58.747
my friends are not even speaking

2071
01:08:58.790 --> 01:08:59.617
to me.

2072
01:08:59.661 --> 01:09:00.488
Well, forget them.

2073
01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:01.445
I'm still speaking to you.

2074
01:09:01.489 --> 01:09:02.509
That's only so I can help you

2075
01:09:02.533 --> 01:09:03.534
in math.

2076
01:09:03.578 --> 01:09:04.666
That's not true.

2077
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:05.493
It's kind of the other way

2078
01:09:05.536 --> 01:09:08.365
around.

2079
01:09:08.409 --> 01:09:09.801
I asked you to help me today so

2080
01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:10.672
I could speak to you about

2081
01:09:10.715 --> 01:09:13.109
something.

2082
01:09:13.153 --> 01:09:15.416
This prom.

2083
01:09:15.459 --> 01:09:16.808
You got a date?

2084
01:09:32.215 --> 01:09:33.477
Did you eat something bad or

2085
01:09:33.521 --> 01:09:35.479
are you just happy to see me?

2086
01:09:35.523 --> 01:09:36.306
Brandon Williams asked me to

2087
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:37.742
the prom.

2088
01:09:37.786 --> 01:09:40.484
Oh!

2089
01:09:41.442 --> 01:09:43.009
That's Sela.

2090
01:09:46.447 --> 01:09:48.014
Hello?

2091
01:09:48.057 --> 01:09:49.058
Brianna.

2092
01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:50.146
Hey, Brianna,

2093
01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:51.060
it's Mrs. Jackson.

2094
01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:53.410
Oh, hey, Mrs. Jackson.

2095
01:09:56.544 --> 01:09:58.328
Uh...

2096
01:09:58.372 --> 01:09:59.329
She's sorry but, you know,

2097
01:09:59.373 --> 01:10:00.635
something came up.

2098
01:10:00.678 --> 01:10:01.810
Is Andrea there?

2099
01:10:01.853 --> 01:10:03.029
Well, honey...

2100
01:10:03.072 --> 01:10:06.336
Can I talk to her?

2101
01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.731
Okay, uh, it's okay.

2102
01:10:09.774 --> 01:10:12.168
I'll just see her at school...

2103
01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:13.561
All right, good-bye.

2104
01:10:16.216 --> 01:10:19.045
That was Andrea's mama.

2105
01:10:19.088 --> 01:10:21.395
She's not coming to the prom.

2106
01:10:21.438 --> 01:10:22.309
She didn't even want to talk

2107
01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:23.875
to me.

2108
01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:25.747
Too ashamed, I bet.

2109
01:10:27.444 --> 01:10:28.576
Brianna.

2110
01:10:28.619 --> 01:10:29.968
Hey, Brianna, my mom says I

2111
01:10:30.012 --> 01:10:31.231
can't go to the prom unless

2112
01:10:31.274 --> 01:10:32.449
it's all black.

2113
01:10:32.493 --> 01:10:33.494
Oh, okay.

2114
01:10:33.537 --> 01:10:34.538
I'm sorry.

2115
01:10:34.582 --> 01:10:35.583
Um, it's not your fault.

2116
01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:38.151
I'll see you tomorrow...

2117
01:10:38.194 --> 01:10:40.066
Okay.

2118
01:10:40.109 --> 01:10:42.546
Tanya Franklin.

2119
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:44.200
She said she... she said her

2120
01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:45.308
parents won't let her go to the

2121
01:10:45.332 --> 01:10:48.770
prom unless it's all black kids.

2122
01:10:48.813 --> 01:10:49.640
Now, you know that's just

2123
01:10:49.684 --> 01:10:50.641
silly.

2124
01:10:50.685 --> 01:10:51.599
Give me the phone,

2125
01:10:51.642 --> 01:10:52.513
I'll call Jolene.

2126
01:10:52.556 --> 01:10:53.556
Don't.

2127
01:10:56.386 --> 01:10:57.735
Hello, Brianna.

2128
01:11:00.347 --> 01:11:01.913
Oh, I'm sorry you won't be

2129
01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:02.958
able to come.

2130
01:11:05.003 --> 01:11:08.398
I'll return your prom dues.

2131
01:11:08.442 --> 01:11:09.356
Yeah, that has been going

2132
01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:11.662
around, hasn't it?

2133
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:17.668
Hello.

2134
01:11:17.712 --> 01:11:18.539
Brianna, I need my money

2135
01:11:18.582 --> 01:11:19.931
back.

2136
01:11:23.109 --> 01:11:24.980
Sure will miss ya.

2137
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:29.071
No, no.

2138
01:11:29.115 --> 01:11:30.420
It's okay.

2139
01:11:30.464 --> 01:11:31.769
I understand.

2140
01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:41.866
Brianna.

2141
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:42.824
Forget about your prom,

2142
01:11:42.867 --> 01:11:44.130
bitch.

2143
01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:56.490
Oh, my God.

2144
01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:00.513
I'm sure you've all heard by

2145
01:12:00.537 --> 01:12:02.104
now... someone broke into the

2146
01:12:02.148 --> 01:12:04.106
school.

2147
01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:06.978
Vandalism is a serious crime,

2148
01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.173
and the state police have been

2149
01:12:08.197 --> 01:12:10.504
called in to investigate.

2150
01:12:10.547 --> 01:12:12.027
Now, I sincerely hope that

2151
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:15.291
none of you are responsible.

2152
01:12:19.904 --> 01:12:22.342
I'm responsible.

2153
01:12:23.734 --> 01:12:25.823
Brianna, please.

2154
01:12:25.867 --> 01:12:26.737
Sit down.

2155
01:12:26.781 --> 01:12:27.999
When I'm an old lady and

2156
01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:29.175
I look at my prom pictures,

2157
01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:30.413
I didn't want to see anybody's

2158
01:12:30.437 --> 01:12:33.614
faces missing from them.

2159
01:12:33.657 --> 01:12:34.441
I wasn't trying to change

2160
01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:35.268
nothing.

2161
01:12:35.311 --> 01:12:36.138
I was trying to keep it

2162
01:12:36.182 --> 01:12:37.008
the same.

2163
01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:37.966
To keep us together like we

2164
01:12:38.009 --> 01:12:40.751
always have been.

2165
01:12:42.884 --> 01:12:43.711
People told me that I was

2166
01:12:43.754 --> 01:12:46.757
ruining prom for everybody,

2167
01:12:46.801 --> 01:12:49.673
but I didn't listen.

2168
01:12:49.717 --> 01:12:52.546
They were right and I was wrong.

2169
01:12:52.589 --> 01:12:54.069
I am responsible for what

2170
01:12:54.112 --> 01:12:56.854
happened here, and I am sorry.

2171
01:12:56.898 --> 01:12:58.900
I am truly sorry.

2172
01:13:07.952 --> 01:13:08.866
You listen to me.

2173
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:10.520
You didn't throw those bricks

2174
01:13:10.564 --> 01:13:11.434
and this isn't your fault.

2175
01:13:11.478 --> 01:13:12.218
Now, there's still kids who want

2176
01:13:12.261 --> 01:13:13.915
a class prom.

2177
01:13:13.958 --> 01:13:15.960
What about them, huh?

2178
01:13:16.004 --> 01:13:17.223
What happened to, "I'm no

2179
01:13:17.266 --> 01:13:18.093
quitter"?

2180
01:13:18.136 --> 01:13:19.050
Uh-uh.

2181
01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:19.964
I never said that.

2182
01:13:20.008 --> 01:13:20.835
You don't stand in front of a

2183
01:13:20.878 --> 01:13:22.445
whole auditorium like Joan of

2184
01:13:22.489 --> 01:13:23.596
Arc or something and then make a

2185
01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.641
big speech, then crawl away

2186
01:13:24.665 --> 01:13:26.319
to die.

2187
01:13:26.362 --> 01:13:27.276
Uh, Joanie was burned at the

2188
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.321
stake though.

2189
01:13:28.364 --> 01:13:29.235
Whatever.

2190
01:13:29.278 --> 01:13:30.714
Just back me up.

2191
01:13:30.758 --> 01:13:31.628
Well, we've still got the,

2192
01:13:31.672 --> 01:13:32.890
uh, Skylight House.

2193
01:13:32.934 --> 01:13:33.804
True.

2194
01:13:33.848 --> 01:13:35.153
Yeah, and no decorations.

2195
01:13:35.197 --> 01:13:36.111
DJ Ray.

2196
01:13:36.154 --> 01:13:37.199
I mean, the man is booked.

2197
01:13:37.243 --> 01:13:38.113
That's true.

2198
01:13:38.156 --> 01:13:38.983
Yeah, we could probably get

2199
01:13:39.027 --> 01:13:40.028
our deposit back.

2200
01:13:40.071 --> 01:13:40.942
Why don't we just get

2201
01:13:40.985 --> 01:13:41.812
everybody to kick in some money,

2202
01:13:41.856 --> 01:13:42.726
replace all the stuff that got

2203
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:43.640
damaged.

2204
01:13:43.684 --> 01:13:44.511
Y'all, do you realize how

2205
01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:45.468
long it took to get the

2206
01:13:45.512 --> 01:13:46.339
decorations and then to put

2207
01:13:46.382 --> 01:13:47.253
it up?

2208
01:13:47.296 --> 01:13:48.317
Uh-uh, y'all, it is too late,

2209
01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:50.604
forget it.

2210
01:13:50.647 --> 01:13:51.518
Where am I supposed to wear

2211
01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:53.259
my tux at... Lee's?

2212
01:13:53.302 --> 01:13:56.566
I guess... Brianna!

2213
01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:58.046
Prom dues.

2214
01:13:58.089 --> 01:13:59.308
Mine and some others.

2215
01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:00.266
I don't care if my father locks

2216
01:14:00.309 --> 01:14:01.504
me up for a year and takes away

2217
01:14:01.528 --> 01:14:03.138
my phone, my CDs and my TV.

2218
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:04.966
I want those pictures you talked

2219
01:14:05.009 --> 01:14:07.360
about.

2220
01:14:10.188 --> 01:14:12.321
Thank you!

2221
01:14:32.907 --> 01:14:34.865
Brianna put you to work?

2222
01:14:34.909 --> 01:14:37.303
Uh, yeah, she's, uh,

2223
01:14:37.346 --> 01:14:39.087
transportation.

2224
01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:41.437
Don't tell the union.

2225
01:14:41.481 --> 01:14:44.135
Thank you.

2226
01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:45.398
It's nice of you to help.

2227
01:14:45.441 --> 01:14:49.053
I'm having fun.

2228
01:14:49.097 --> 01:14:51.621
Are we okay?

2229
01:14:51.665 --> 01:14:54.015
You tell me.

2230
01:14:54.058 --> 01:14:54.929
Look, I'm sorry I gave you

2231
01:14:54.972 --> 01:14:57.105
such a hard time.

2232
01:14:57.148 --> 01:14:59.368
I was wrong.

2233
01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:01.762
About everything.

2234
01:15:01.805 --> 01:15:03.764
Everything?

2235
01:15:03.807 --> 01:15:04.982
Give or take a comma.

2236
01:15:05.026 --> 01:15:07.158
I want us to be friends.

2237
01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:08.246
Just friends?

2238
01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:09.204
We don't want to start

2239
01:15:09.247 --> 01:15:10.553
something we can't finish.

2240
01:15:10.597 --> 01:15:11.641
We don't?

2241
01:15:11.685 --> 01:15:14.209
We don't.

2242
01:15:14.252 --> 01:15:15.079
Is it the white thing?

2243
01:15:15.123 --> 01:15:16.559
Because I could tan.

2244
01:15:16.603 --> 01:15:19.606
No, Mark, it's not the white

2245
01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:21.477
thing.

2246
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:23.131
Look, you live in Mercier and I

2247
01:15:23.174 --> 01:15:25.176
live in New Orleans.

2248
01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.874
Two hours as the crow flies.

2249
01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:28.049
It's not the distance.

2250
01:15:28.092 --> 01:15:29.137
You really hate this town,

2251
01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:30.704
don't you?

2252
01:15:30.747 --> 01:15:32.401
No, no, I don't.

2253
01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.664
Not anymore.

2254
01:15:34.708 --> 01:15:37.363
When my brother died so young,

2255
01:15:37.406 --> 01:15:38.668
somehow I got it into my head

2256
01:15:38.712 --> 01:15:39.863
that the same thing was gonna

2257
01:15:39.887 --> 01:15:41.149
happen to me and I had to get

2258
01:15:41.192 --> 01:15:42.324
out, you know, and just see

2259
01:15:42.368 --> 01:15:44.239
everything and do everything.

2260
01:15:44.282 --> 01:15:46.981
And, I don't know, looking back

2261
01:15:47.024 --> 01:15:50.419
now, maybe I wasn't really

2262
01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:53.422
running from Mercier.

2263
01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:54.380
You know, maybe I was just

2264
01:15:54.423 --> 01:15:56.251
running.

2265
01:15:56.294 --> 01:15:57.208
I remember once a long time

2266
01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:58.732
ago, you said you couldn't

2267
01:15:58.775 --> 01:16:00.124
breathe in this town.

2268
01:16:00.168 --> 01:16:00.995
Just needed to get away for a

2269
01:16:01.038 --> 01:16:02.213
little while.

2270
01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:03.171
Kept waiting for you to come

2271
01:16:03.214 --> 01:16:04.651
back, but you didn't.

2272
01:16:04.694 --> 01:16:06.783
I don't mind waiting, Dez.

2273
01:16:06.827 --> 01:16:07.697
This conversation's going a

2274
01:16:07.741 --> 01:16:09.786
little too far too fast for me.

2275
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:11.571
Uh, can we... can we back up to

2276
01:16:11.614 --> 01:16:14.965
friends?

2277
01:16:15.009 --> 01:16:16.445
Friends.

2278
01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:17.925
Okay.

2279
01:16:17.968 --> 01:16:19.056
Spit and shake.

2280
01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:19.883
Oh, Lord.

2281
01:16:19.927 --> 01:16:21.668
Mark, that is so nasty!

2282
01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:22.582
We are not in high school

2283
01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:25.933
anymore.

2284
01:16:25.976 --> 01:16:28.239
Yeah, you keep reminding me.

2285
01:16:46.083 --> 01:16:48.912
♪♪

2286
01:17:24.948 --> 01:17:27.647
What are you doing out here?

2287
01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:28.865
Uh, I was looking for Mama's

2288
01:17:28.909 --> 01:17:31.520
sewing kit.

2289
01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:34.088
Um, these are all the stories I

2290
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:35.282
ever wrote in high school and

2291
01:17:35.306 --> 01:17:36.612
college.

2292
01:17:36.656 --> 01:17:38.179
Yeah, well, Mama had 'em

2293
01:17:38.222 --> 01:17:40.616
packed away in a box.

2294
01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:41.530
I thought they'd keep better in

2295
01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:42.836
a book.

2296
01:17:42.879 --> 01:17:46.056
Easier to read.

2297
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.711
You did this?

2298
01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:55.501
You know I love both my kids.

2299
01:17:55.544 --> 01:17:56.327
But I always knew you were

2300
01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.155
something special.

2301
01:17:58.199 --> 01:17:59.156
No, Daddy, Russell was the

2302
01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.157
one who was special.

2303
01:18:00.201 --> 01:18:02.551
No, no, no, no, no.

2304
01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:04.771
He's my son.

2305
01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:05.989
But you...

2306
01:18:06.033 --> 01:18:09.819
Girl, you were something else.

2307
01:18:09.863 --> 01:18:10.733
You always had that chin stuck

2308
01:18:10.777 --> 01:18:12.300
way out as if you were saying,

2309
01:18:12.343 --> 01:18:14.911
"Life, come on at me."

2310
01:18:22.571 --> 01:18:23.592
I thought if I made it tough

2311
01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.966
on you, if I made things hard,

2312
01:18:26.009 --> 01:18:27.315
you'd do all right.

2313
01:18:27.358 --> 01:18:28.185
Wouldn't get taken out by the

2314
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:29.796
first punch.

2315
01:18:33.582 --> 01:18:34.496
See, a man always wants to see

2316
01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.281
his children do better than him,

2317
01:18:37.325 --> 01:18:40.676
be a better person than he was.

2318
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.852
Daddy, I'm not a better

2319
01:18:42.896 --> 01:18:44.158
person than you.

2320
01:18:44.201 --> 01:18:46.595
I never could be.

2321
01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:47.596
Yeah, yeah, all right, all

2322
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.641
right.

2323
01:18:48.684 --> 01:18:50.599
Look, you can take that book if

2324
01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.383
you want it.

2325
01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:55.517
It's all full up.

2326
01:18:55.561 --> 01:18:57.127
I'll go make another one.

2327
01:19:06.397 --> 01:19:07.181
I just got a call from

2328
01:19:07.224 --> 01:19:09.923
Mercier High School.

2329
01:19:09.966 --> 01:19:12.534
What now?

2330
01:19:12.578 --> 01:19:14.275
You're class valedictorian.

2331
01:19:14.318 --> 01:19:15.276
Close your mouth before you

2332
01:19:15.319 --> 01:19:16.582
swallow a fly!

2333
01:19:16.625 --> 01:19:18.192
It's you, baby, 
I'm not joking!

2334
01:19:18.235 --> 01:19:19.062
Oh, goodness!

2335
01:19:19.106 --> 01:19:19.933
I can't believe it!

2336
01:19:19.976 --> 01:19:20.847
I can't believe it!

2337
01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:21.717
I mean it... oh, be careful

2338
01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:22.631
of your dress, your dress.

2339
01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.198
Oh, my goodness.

2340
01:19:24.241 --> 01:19:25.068
I think I'm gonna faint.

2341
01:19:25.112 --> 01:19:26.287
Don't you dare.

2342
01:19:29.072 --> 01:19:29.986
That can't be him,

2343
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.857
it's too early.

2344
01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.640
Okay, you put on your shoes,

2345
01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:32.598
and I'll get the door.

2346
01:19:32.641 --> 01:19:33.903
Okay.

2347
01:19:41.258 --> 01:19:42.433
Come on in.

2348
01:19:42.477 --> 01:19:44.000
Hey, Brianna.

2349
01:19:44.044 --> 01:19:45.915
Stand up, let me see you.

2350
01:19:45.959 --> 01:19:47.656
You look beautiful.

2351
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.788
Thank you.

2352
01:19:48.831 --> 01:19:49.702
So do you.

2353
01:19:49.745 --> 01:19:50.659
Well, thank you.

2354
01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:53.836
I can't find my shoes.

2355
01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.013
Um, they're right there.

2356
01:19:57.057 --> 01:19:59.407
Thank you.

2357
01:19:59.450 --> 01:20:00.582
Uh, did Ely go and make sure

2358
01:20:00.626 --> 01:20:01.496
that the sound system is still

2359
01:20:01.539 --> 01:20:02.540
working?

2360
01:20:02.584 --> 01:20:03.541
Yes, and...

2361
01:20:03.585 --> 01:20:04.760
I forgot to order the ice.

2362
01:20:04.804 --> 01:20:06.109
Honey, the ice is on its way.

2363
01:20:06.153 --> 01:20:08.242
You need to relax.

2364
01:20:08.285 --> 01:20:09.504
Can you tell I'm nervous?

2365
01:20:09.547 --> 01:20:10.723
You look beautiful.

2366
01:20:10.766 --> 01:20:11.724
No need to be nervous.

2367
01:20:11.767 --> 01:20:12.681
My earrings.

2368
01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:14.378
I don't know where my earrings...

2369
01:20:14.422 --> 01:20:16.685
Brianna, they're right here.

2370
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.165
Oh.

2371
01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:20.428
Thank you.

2372
01:20:20.471 --> 01:20:21.255
I think you need to take a

2373
01:20:21.298 --> 01:20:23.518
deep breath.

2374
01:20:27.217 --> 01:20:28.001
Is that better?

2375
01:20:28.044 --> 01:20:29.524
No.

2376
01:20:32.788 --> 01:20:33.809
I wanna... I wanna give you

2377
01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:35.443
something.

2378
01:20:39.142 --> 01:20:41.579
This belonged to my

2379
01:20:41.623 --> 01:20:44.626
grandmother.

2380
01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:46.976
Oh, my.

2381
01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:50.719
Oh... Oh, it is beautiful.

2382
01:20:52.155 --> 01:20:54.288
But I can't accept it.

2383
01:20:54.331 --> 01:20:55.855
It needs to stay in your family.

2384
01:20:55.898 --> 01:20:59.554
Oh, honey, you are my family.

2385
