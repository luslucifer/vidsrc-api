Happy holidays from all of us
down here in Dallas.


23
00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.038
We'll be wishing you
lots of Christmas cheer.


24
00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.122
Stay warm up there.

25
00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:57.749
Bye now.

26
00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:02.712
Speaking of holiday cheer,
you sure look full of it.


27
00:01:02.754 --> 00:01:05.715
Yeah, I'm just thankful that we
planned these articles a year out.


28
00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:08.635
But you've still got to have your
pitch for the meeting tomorrow.


29
00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:12.096
Remember, the feature and the
cover are on the line here.


30
00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.474
Thank you for
the added layer of pressure.


31
00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:16.226
Not that I needed it.

32
00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:18.728
I'm just sayin',
after Daniel's cover story


33
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.064
about the history
of <i>The Nutcracker</i> last year,


34
00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:22.649
it got a lot of eyes, hon.

35
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.069
And Daniel got a book deal.
I know. Be like Daniel.


36
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.946
Be like Daniel.

37
00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.280
Ha!

38
00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:33.910
All right, guys, tomorrow
morning, uh, 8:30 a.m. sharp,


39
00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:37.121
but I gotta say I need
a little more nuance.


40
00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.748
You know, a little more flair.

41
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.960
I need our readers to have
an experience on the page,


42
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.337
'cause if they can't travel
the world for Christmas,


43
00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.589
we're going to bring
Christmas to them, okay?


44
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.092
Youse got it?
All right, I know you do.


45
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.386
Don't let me down.

46
00:01:51.427 --> 00:01:55.014
It just seems like every
Christmas tradition on the planet


47
00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:57.451
has already been covered already...
I mean, Christmas wedding, done.


48
00:01:57.475 --> 00:01:58.768
Christmas on the ranch?
Done.


49
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.145
Do you want
a Christmas cruise? Done.


50
00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.106
There isn't
a gingerbread competition,


51
00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:06.442
a quaint village or a tree
lighting we haven't explored.


52
00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:08.403
- What else is left?
- Christmas in space?


53
00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:10.613
Do you think I could do it?

54
00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:12.782
Look, maybe you're thinking
too globally here.


55
00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:15.160
Girl, the holidays are
all about family.


56
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.620
Maybe you should try
looking closer to home?


57
00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:19.080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.541
I'm sure the readers would love
to hear about my parents


59
00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:25.628
struggling to take the Christmas
decorations down from the attic.


60
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.298
Speaking of which,
I promised I would go help them


61
00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.050
later tonight, so...

62
00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:34.137
I'm going to go grab
some leftovers from the party


63
00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:35.388
and head out.

64
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.390
Oh, lots of missed calls.

65
00:02:37.432 --> 00:02:40.852
See? Family time.

66
00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.646
Who knows? Maybe
you'll get some inspiration.


67
00:02:43.688 --> 00:02:47.901
I don't need inspiration,
I need a Christmas miracle.


68
00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:50.987
Go on and get
that Christmas miracle, girl.


69
00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:52.489
Thank you.

70
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.161
Lord, help her.

71

Are y'all home?


86
00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.801
- I got coffee.
- Ah, bless you.


87
00:03:54.843 --> 00:03:57.095
I thought the coffee
would never get here.


88
00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.304
And you, of course.

89
00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:00.223
But mostly the coffee.

90
00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:01.975
Hey, kiddo.

91
00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:03.268
Hi.

92
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.769
Your holiday favorite.

93
00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.400
Oh! Is that nutmeg I'm tasting?

94
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:12.569
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't get too cozy.


95
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.363
We can't take a break
until everything's down.


96
00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:17.365
She's so bossy.

97
00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:19.701
Hey, it was your idea
to get a jump start


98
00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:21.244
on clearing out the attic.

99
00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:23.079
Remind me to keep my mouth shut.

100
00:04:26.374 --> 00:04:27.876
Mm!

101
00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:29.677
Oh, no, no, no,
we did beach Santa last year.


102
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:31.838
Let's do, uh,
Vegas Santa this year.


103
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.882
- Right.
- I don't want to keep you too late,


104
00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:36.843
because you, young lady,
have a pitch to write.


105
00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:39.679
I know, I know.

106
00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:44.809
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?


107
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:49.480
Do you mind if I take
this Campbell box home with me?


108
00:05:39.614 --> 00:05:41.241
Hi, Everett.

109
00:05:54.212 --> 00:05:56.005
Can you get that, hon?

110
00:05:56.047 --> 00:05:58.800
It's probably the Pere Noel
Festival planning committee!


111
00:06:01.636 --> 00:06:03.638
Bergeron residence.
Everett speaking.


112
00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:07.350
Hello? Is anyone there?

113
00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:10.144
Uh, yeah, hi. Um...

114
00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:12.397
<i>Um... is...</i>

115
00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:13.940
Jennifer Bergeron there?

116
00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:16.025
I'm-I'm calling
for this Christmas...


117
00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:18.027
Yeah, yeah.
Hang on, she's right here.


118
00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.821
- Here you go.
- Oh.


119
00:06:19.863 --> 00:06:21.447
Hello.

120
00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:25.201
Hi. J-Jennifer.
This is, uh, Campbell Wallace.


121
00:06:25.243 --> 00:06:26.870
<i>You left me a voicemail?</i>

122
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:28.163
Yes, of course!

123
00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:31.082
Uh... can you give me a minute?

124
00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.709
Christmas emergency.

125
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.752
Um, you can start without me,
I'll be right there.


126
00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:35.837
Sure.

127
00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:44.262
Well, um...

128
00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:45.513
hi there, Campbell.

129
00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:47.724
<i>Uh, this is, um...</i>

130
00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:50.435
Well, I'm just so glad
that you called.


131
00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:53.855
Yeah, well,
you left me a voicemail.


132
00:06:53.897 --> 00:06:56.649
Oh, and my letter
a few months ago?


133
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:58.234
What... How did you find me?

134
00:06:58.276 --> 00:06:59.861
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

135
00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:01.529
I kept looking
for an Alice Bergeron


136
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:03.239
because that's what
he calls you, but...


137
00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:05.533
Yeah, there were five Alices
in my preschool


138
00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:08.203
and my dad gave me
the nickname, so...


139
00:07:08.244 --> 00:07:09.829
<i>"Campbell" just kind of stuck.</i>

140
00:07:09.871 --> 00:07:13.082
Well, um, took me
a while, but...


141
00:07:13.124 --> 00:07:14.792
eventually I got there.

142
00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:19.214
It's amazing what you can find
online these days, right?


143
00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:22.300
I know that I may be
overstepping here, and...


144
00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:25.428
<i>when you didn't answer my letter,
I figured I should just leave it be.</i>


145
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.347
Then why didn't you?

146
00:07:27.388 --> 00:07:28.473
<i>Well, um...</i>

147
00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:30.433
here in Ascension Parish

148
00:07:30.475 --> 00:07:33.436
fires on the levee light... they
light the way for Pere Noel,


149
00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:35.021
<i>Santa Claus, you know,</i>

150
00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:38.107
and our old Pere Noel
has retired


151
00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:40.777
and Everett has been chosen
to replace him.


152
00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:43.071
- Okay.
<i>- And...</i>


153
00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:45.031
it's a big deal.

154
00:07:45.073 --> 00:07:48.618
<i>It's an honor that you want
to share with your family,</i>


155
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.912
and I guess what
I'm trying to say is


156
00:07:50.954 --> 00:07:54.249
that ever since
he's been chosen...


157
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.877
he... he just doesn't think
he deserves it because...


158
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.297
he can't stop
thinking about you.


159
00:08:02.507 --> 00:08:04.217
<i>I don't know.</i>

160
00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:08.304
I thought, well, this
is sort of my Hail Mary pass,


161
00:08:08.346 --> 00:08:11.015
<i>- to see if...</i>
- It's a really nice offer,


162
00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:13.059
uh, but I've been fine
without him


163
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:15.019
<i>most of my life,
so, um, thank you, but...</i>


164
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.896
Mom, dinner's getting cold.

165
00:08:16.938 --> 00:08:19.148
Yeah, come on.
We wanna make Christmas cookies!


166
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.817
Just a minute, girls.

167
00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:22.819
Who... Who was that?

168
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:25.905
Oh, Mary-Margaret and Amelia.
They would be...


169
00:08:27.157 --> 00:08:28.408
Well, um...

170
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:31.828
<i>they're your sisters.</i>

171
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.563
Oh, focus, um...

172
00:08:58.605 --> 00:08:59.939
Okay.

173
00:09:01.524 --> 00:09:02.984
Feature...

174
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:46.152
All right, guys, I am loving the
international angle right now.


175
00:09:46.194 --> 00:09:48.905
Let's run with that. Oh, and the
Christmas Barbecue Cook-Off...


176
00:09:48.947 --> 00:09:51.991
- Oh. Hello, Campbell.
- Sorry.


177
00:09:52.033 --> 00:09:54.202
Nice of you to join us.
Um, anyway, uh...


178
00:09:54.244 --> 00:09:56.412
Oh, the Dallas piece
for the Christmas Cook-Off.


179
00:09:56.454 --> 00:09:57.956
Fantastic.

180
00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:01.125
But for this feature
I'm looking for something,


181
00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.419
something with
a bit more culture,


182
00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:04.754
you know, a bit more heart,

183
00:10:04.796 --> 00:10:06.714
something that we haven't
seen before...


184
00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:08.758
What's that?

185
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.593
- Oh, uh, no.
- What's this?


186
00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:13.763
- Nope, that's...
- Oh, this is fantastic.


187
00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:15.765
Are you ready to pitch this?

188
00:10:15.807 --> 00:10:18.852
- Yeah.
- Let's see this pitch.


189
00:10:18.893 --> 00:10:20.979
Give Campbell the floor, guys.
All right.


190
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.231
Yep.

191
00:10:23.273 --> 00:10:25.108
Uh... okay.

192
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.110
So...

193
00:10:27.152 --> 00:10:29.320
there's this town in Louisiana

194
00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.239
called Sorrento,

195
00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:34.033
uh, where the people try
to make Christmas special,


196
00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:36.244
even though there's no snow.

197
00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:40.915
And so, on Christmas Eve,
they light the bayou


198
00:10:40.957 --> 00:10:44.127
to guide Pere Noel,
their version of Santa Claus,


199
00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:45.920
to their homes.

200
00:10:45.962 --> 00:10:49.507
And this year,
the new Pere Noel is a man


201
00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:52.010
named Everett Bergeron.

202
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:54.137
He's a successful businessman.

203
00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:56.389
Runs a popular meat pie shop...

204
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:59.475
Right, right, but who is he?

205
00:11:00.518 --> 00:11:02.187
Um...

206
00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:05.356
I mean, I guess that
would be the story, really,


207
00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:07.442
figuring that out.

208
00:11:07.484 --> 00:11:08.776
I like it.

209
00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:10.236
Good job.

210
00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:19.204
So, I'm thinking
we finish decorating the tree,


211
00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:21.498
make some hot chocolate, and...

212
00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:24.334
ride around the neighborhood
and look at the lights.


213
00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:26.836
Way ahead of you
on the hot chocolate part.


214
00:11:26.878 --> 00:11:29.005
Gary!
That was for later.


215
00:11:29.047 --> 00:11:32.717
I'm a simple man, Sarah.
I see hot chocolate, I drink it.


216
00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:35.470
So... somebody had
a big meeting today.


217
00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:38.389
And somebody is being
very quiet about it.


218
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.725
Uh, yeah. It was good.

219
00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.019
I'm in contention
for the feature.


220
00:11:43.061 --> 00:11:45.104
Well, what are we doing
drinking hot chocolate?


221
00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:46.814
We should pop open
the champagne!


222
00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:48.525
It's nothing yet.

223
00:11:48.566 --> 00:11:49.943
And, um...

224
00:11:49.984 --> 00:11:52.070
it does mean that
I'm leaving tomorrow


225
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:55.698
and that I won't see you two
on Christmas morning.


226
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.075
Landing the feature!

227
00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.077
Almost landing the feature.

228
00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:01.871
Well, almost landing
the feature is a big deal.


229
00:12:01.913 --> 00:12:04.499
When we open presents isn't.

230
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:06.167
Now, tell us everything.

231
00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:10.171
Okay, uh...

232
00:12:10.213 --> 00:12:13.967
There's this small town
in Louisiana


233
00:12:14.008 --> 00:12:17.512
where they ask a man
in the town to be, like,


234
00:12:17.554 --> 00:12:19.722
their version of Santa Claus.

235
00:12:19.764 --> 00:12:22.141
Louisiana?

236
00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:26.521
Ascension Parish, actually.

237
00:12:26.563 --> 00:12:28.189
Sorrento.

238
00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:32.569
So... you want
to meet your father.


239
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.863
Well, no.

240
00:12:34.904 --> 00:12:36.948
Yes?

241
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.075
I just...

242
00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:41.953
I feel like going
is the right thing to do.


243
00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:44.164
When you were 13,
we sat you down


244
00:12:44.205 --> 00:12:46.332
and we asked you
if you wanted to meet him,


245
00:12:46.374 --> 00:12:49.669
if you wanted to have a relationship
with him, and you said that you...


246
00:12:49.711 --> 00:12:51.629
I said it was his loss
when he left


247
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:53.548
and I have all the family
I need.


248
00:12:54.632 --> 00:12:56.384
That hasn't changed.

249
00:12:56.426 --> 00:12:59.762
Well, I'm not trying to hold you
to what you wanted as a child.


250
00:12:59.804 --> 00:13:02.432
But I do wonder, why now?

251
00:13:03.975 --> 00:13:06.102
Mama, I have sisters.

252
00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:12.942
And I do wonder about him.

253
00:13:12.984 --> 00:13:14.235
You know?

254
00:13:14.277 --> 00:13:16.779
I think that
if I don't do this now,


255
00:13:16.821 --> 00:13:18.364
I always will.

256
00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:23.286
I just don't want you
to get hurt, that's all.


257
00:13:23.328 --> 00:13:25.163
I know.

258
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.167
I...

259
00:13:30.084 --> 00:13:31.669
Will you excuse me?

260
00:13:43.765 --> 00:13:45.975
You aren't mad at me, are you?

261
00:13:46.017 --> 00:13:49.521
Or upset that
I would want to meet him?


262
00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:52.315
Why would I be mad?

263
00:13:52.357 --> 00:13:55.109
You are my dad.
And you're a great dad.


264
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:57.570
Campbell, it's okay.

265
00:13:57.612 --> 00:14:00.490
I know you love me.

266
00:14:00.532 --> 00:14:04.661
And honestly, I had a feeling
this day would come.


267
00:14:07.163 --> 00:14:08.706
And what about Mom?

268
00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:10.667
Is this what you want, kiddo?

269
00:14:12.377 --> 00:14:14.754
Yeah. It is.

270
00:14:14.796 --> 00:14:16.840
Then she'll come around.

271
00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:19.092
I promise.

272
00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:22.011
Yeah.

273
00:14:22.053 --> 00:14:24.180
Let's finish
decorating the tree.


274
00:14:24.222 --> 00:14:26.432
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- Yes.


275
00:14:26.474 --> 00:14:28.059
Coming.

276
00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:04.345
Campbell. It's so nice
to finally meet you.


277
00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:09.809
- Do we hug?
- Yeah, sure.


278
00:15:09.851 --> 00:15:12.353
Okay.

279
00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:14.564
I'm sorry, I'm just so excited.

280
00:15:14.606 --> 00:15:18.026
I've been hearing about you,
well, since I met your father,


281
00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:20.278
so... 20 years?

282
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.157
- And here you are!
- Here I am.


283
00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:26.868
Um, he's running errands
and the girls are at school.


284
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.787
I thought it would be nice
if it was just us for a minute.


285
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:31.706
- Great. Thank you.
- Yeah.


286
00:15:31.748 --> 00:15:34.417
So, you'll be staying down the
road at a cute little cottage


287
00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:36.628
owned by friends of ours,
the Shepherds.


288
00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:38.046
Oh, the Shepherds,

289
00:15:38.087 --> 00:15:40.298
they don't know that
I'm Everett's daughter?


290
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.927
No, no, no, no. No.
That's yours to tell, not mine.


291
00:15:43.968 --> 00:15:45.762
But they do know
about the article,


292
00:15:45.803 --> 00:15:47.764
and we're going to give you
a lot to write about.


293
00:15:47.805 --> 00:15:50.975
Mr. Shepherd is the Pere Noel
who's stepping down


294
00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:53.937
and his grandson Jackson
is the town liaison,


295
00:15:53.978 --> 00:15:55.772
so he can help you out too.

296
00:15:55.813 --> 00:15:57.690
- Great.
- But, uh, look.


297
00:15:57.732 --> 00:16:00.485
If it gets too much and you feel
like you need to leave...


298
00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:03.446
Jennifer? I...
I'll be all right.


299
00:16:03.488 --> 00:16:04.948
Don't worry.

300
00:16:04.989 --> 00:16:06.950
That's what moms do, I guess.
We worry.


301
00:16:06.991 --> 00:16:09.619
But you're right, um...

302
00:16:09.661 --> 00:16:11.329
So, uh...

303
00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:13.373
Come on inside.
I got that.


304
00:16:13.414 --> 00:16:14.958
- And I'll show you...
- Thank you.


305
00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:16.459
Show you the house.

306
00:16:16.501 --> 00:16:17.961
So this is it.

307
00:16:18.002 --> 00:16:19.462
So, as you can see,

308
00:16:19.504 --> 00:16:22.340
we do like to decorate
for the holidays.


309
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.428
Yeah, those. Uh...

310
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.098
We started making pecan hand
pies one year for Christmas,


311
00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:34.561
and ever since then, we keep
thinking we need help shelling them.


312
00:16:34.602 --> 00:16:39.148
Don't worry about it. We collect,
um, novelty Santas back home.


313
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.733
Um, can I get you anything?

314
00:16:40.775 --> 00:16:44.445
It is Christmas,
so eggnog or hot cocoa or...


315
00:16:44.487 --> 00:16:47.240
- Any water?
- I can manage that, yes.


316
00:16:47.282 --> 00:16:49.576
Be back in a minute.
You just make yourself at home.


317
00:16:57.667 --> 00:16:59.502
I did have an idea.

318
00:16:59.544 --> 00:17:03.256
You know, if you're not sure
that you want to come out


319
00:17:03.298 --> 00:17:04.674
and tell Everett who you are?

320
00:17:04.716 --> 00:17:06.342
Yeah?

321
00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:08.928
Well, since you're
already doing the article,


322
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.349
maybe you could
use that as a cover?


323
00:17:13.391 --> 00:17:15.935
You know,
observe him, get to know him,


324
00:17:15.977 --> 00:17:18.855
and tell him when you're ready.

325
00:17:18.897 --> 00:17:20.607
Isn't that a little dishonest?

326
00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:24.235
Well, I'm not saying that I feel
great about the idea, but...


327
00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:26.446
I mean, I came
all the way here, right?


328
00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:28.948
I should be able to look him in
the eye and tell him who I am.


329
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.366
Well, of course.

330
00:17:30.408 --> 00:17:31.910
You know, I understand,
though, if...


331
00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:35.038
- Jennifer, are you here?
- Oh, um...


332
00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:37.415
Sure am, darling!

333
00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:39.167
And, uh, we have some company.

334
00:17:39.209 --> 00:17:40.752
Company?

335
00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:44.339
Hello there.

336
00:17:48.343 --> 00:17:50.345
This is Campbell Wallace.

337
00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:52.972
Ah, Everett Bergeron.

338
00:17:53.014 --> 00:17:55.808
Nice to meet you. Welcome.

339
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.229
Um, it's a little complicated
to explain, but she's...


340
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.273
A reporter.

341
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:05.401
Uh, yeah, I'm here to write
a story about you


342
00:18:05.443 --> 00:18:07.529
for <i>Airvent</i> magazine.

343
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.697
Nothing complicated about it.

344
00:18:09.739 --> 00:18:11.616
Okay.

345
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:22.293
So, you're a reporter?

346
00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:23.711
Huh?

347
00:18:23.753 --> 00:18:26.214
- Surprise!
- Yeah, it sure is.


348
00:18:26.256 --> 00:18:28.049
Uh, what'd you say
your name was again?


349
00:18:28.091 --> 00:18:30.802
- Campbell Wallace.
- Uh-huh.


350
00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:34.597
Um, your wife tipped me off
about you becoming


351
00:18:34.639 --> 00:18:36.182
Sorrento's new Pere Noel,

352
00:18:36.224 --> 00:18:38.268
and we think our readers
will love it.


353
00:18:38.309 --> 00:18:42.647
Well, look, I'm not much of a story, but...
you're the expert.


354
00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:44.649
No, you really should
read her articles.


355
00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:47.235
- Okay.
- Um, she's been everywhere.


356
00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:50.071
- A real world traveler.
- Sure, yeah, yes.


357
00:18:50.113 --> 00:18:51.406
Um...

358
00:18:51.447 --> 00:18:53.283
And when I cover these things,

359
00:18:53.324 --> 00:18:56.035
I get... I get to know the town

360
00:18:56.077 --> 00:18:58.163
and, uh, the traditions,

361
00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:59.831
and, uh, well, and this time,

362
00:18:59.873 --> 00:19:01.499
the man behind
the big white beard.


363
00:19:03.084 --> 00:19:04.794
And actually, because the honor

364
00:19:04.836 --> 00:19:07.255
is about you and your family,

365
00:19:07.297 --> 00:19:09.966
I would like to get
to know both.


366
00:19:10.008 --> 00:19:11.593
If you'll let me.

367
00:19:13.678 --> 00:19:15.513
Well...

368
00:19:15.555 --> 00:19:17.390
all right, Campbell.

369
00:19:17.432 --> 00:19:19.267
Uh, it sounds fine.

370
00:19:19.309 --> 00:19:20.977
I just hope I don't
disappoint you.


371
00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:24.189
Yeah, I hope so, too.

372
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.358
Uh, I gotta git... a whole new
batch of orders came in.


373
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.110
- Oh, for the meat pie business?
- Yep.


374
00:19:29.152 --> 00:19:30.904
This is the busiest time
of year.


375
00:19:30.945 --> 00:19:33.573
Seems like every town in a

376
00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:35.783
and we ship
all over the country.


377
00:19:35.825 --> 00:19:38.036
Stick around,
I'll show you how we make them.


378
00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:39.954
- I would like that.
- Yeah.


379
00:19:39.996 --> 00:19:42.415
Honey bun. Hey, the mayor's
party, you got that covered?


380
00:19:42.457 --> 00:19:45.251
Yes. I'll get the delivery going
when the girls get home from school.


381
00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:47.837
All right.

382
00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:50.673
"When out on the roof,

383
00:19:50.715 --> 00:19:53.510
there arose such a clatter..."

384
00:19:55.512 --> 00:19:57.931
- We're home! Hello?
- Hello.


385
00:19:57.972 --> 00:19:59.516
Hey, there they are!

386
00:19:59.557 --> 00:20:03.186
How are my best girls?
How you doin'?


387
00:20:03.228 --> 00:20:05.813
- Wow. Father of the year.
- How was your last day of school?


388
00:20:05.855 --> 00:20:07.815
He's made lots of mistakes,

389
00:20:07.857 --> 00:20:11.069
but I know that he would really
like to make it right with you.


390
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.821
Listen,
I gotta fill some orders,


391
00:20:12.862 --> 00:20:14.864
so please
take care of your mom, okay?


392
00:20:14.906 --> 00:20:17.033
Be nice, we have a visitor!

393
00:20:20.787 --> 00:20:23.623
Hi! Dad says not to be nightmares
because we have a guest.


394
00:20:23.665 --> 00:20:25.083
I'm guessing that's you?

395
00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:26.918
Hi, I'm Campbell.
It's nice to meet you.


396
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.129
I'm Amelia.
This is Mary-Margaret.


397
00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:34.467
Um, Campbell is doing an article
on Pere Noel for A <i>irvent</i>magazine.


398
00:20:34.509 --> 00:20:35.969
- Yeah.
- Oh, great.


399
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.846
Love to spend Christmas break
with strangers.


400
00:20:37.887 --> 00:20:40.640
- Mary-Margaret!
- It's okay, I get it.


401
00:20:40.682 --> 00:20:43.059
Um... I probably wouldn't
want to spend Christmas


402
00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:45.496
with someone who writes for an
airplane magazine, either, so...


403
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.082
Wait, you mean the ones that they
give out with the little peanut bags?


404
00:20:48.106 --> 00:20:50.608
Yeah, the... the one
with the peanut bags.


405
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.944
- That's cool.
- Yeah. You know what else is cool?


406
00:20:52.986 --> 00:20:55.738
Uh, Mom, we know what's cool
way more than you do.


407
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.615
- Yeah, we're tastemakers.
- Oh.


408
00:20:57.657 --> 00:21:00.577
Well, how do the tastemakers
feel about chores?


409
00:21:00.618 --> 00:21:05.874
Um, chores are not trending
right now, so...


410
00:21:05.915 --> 00:21:07.959
It's good PR for the business.

411
00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:10.461
Mary-Margaret
runs all of our socials.


412
00:21:10.503 --> 00:21:13.339
She's, uh,
quite the content creator.


413
00:21:13.381 --> 00:21:14.924
Kind of like you.

414
00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:17.051
Fine. But only for the 'gram.

415
00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:19.679
Well, then it's settled.
Catering delivery.


416
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:21.598
So, off. Put on your shirts.

417
00:21:21.639 --> 00:21:24.058
- All right, okay.
- All right, you too. Go, go!


418
00:21:25.602 --> 00:21:27.520
So, would you like to join us?

419
00:21:27.562 --> 00:21:29.772
- Sure. I would love to.
- Great. Come on.


420
00:21:32.567 --> 00:21:36.571
Let's go, girls!
We're leaving in ten minutes!


421
00:21:36.613 --> 00:21:39.115
Hey.
They put you to work already?


422
00:21:39.157 --> 00:21:41.326
Oh, don't worry.
I'm a very immersive writer.


423
00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:42.869
I like to get in the trenches,

424
00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:45.205
or the Christmas parties,
as the case may be.


425
00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:48.458
Okay. So, is this the part
where, I don't know,


426
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.044
you ask what Pere Noel
means to me


427
00:21:51.085 --> 00:21:53.296
or my top five
Christmas cookies?


428
00:21:53.338 --> 00:21:56.674
Oh, you know, well, I have got
so many questions for you,


429
00:21:56.716 --> 00:21:58.343
you wouldn't even believe.

430
00:21:58.384 --> 00:22:00.428
Well, where do we start, then?

431
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.098
Uh, what about your girls?
Your daughters?


432
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.642
My daughters?

433
00:22:05.683 --> 00:22:08.311
It's quite a brood
you've got there.


434
00:22:09.729 --> 00:22:13.107
Oh, yeah. Well...

435
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:14.484
they're my everything.

436
00:22:14.526 --> 00:22:16.236
I couldn't imagine life
without them.


437
00:22:18.321 --> 00:22:20.323
Campbell! Come on!

438
00:22:20.365 --> 00:22:22.575
- Oh.
- Good luck. You'll need it.


439
00:22:22.617 --> 00:22:24.244
Thank you.

440
00:22:29.207 --> 00:22:31.084
So, you're a writer, huh?

441
00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:34.379
Uh, yeah.
I take pictures, too. See?


442
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.797
Cool.

443
00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:37.966
- Wow, nice.
- You wanna try?


444
00:22:38.007 --> 00:22:39.342
Um, sure.

445
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.929
Uh-uh.

446
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:45.223
Whoo-whoo.

447
00:22:45.265 --> 00:22:46.516
So, what do you write about?

448
00:22:46.558 --> 00:22:47.809
Um...

449
00:22:47.851 --> 00:22:50.353
<i>Je suis une auteure de voyage.</i>

450
00:22:52.313 --> 00:22:54.440
That's French for
"I'm a travel writer."


451
00:22:54.482 --> 00:22:56.109
- Oh.
- Oh!


452
00:22:56.151 --> 00:22:58.486
And what's French for
"Pere Noel's going to bring me


453
00:22:58.528 --> 00:23:00.155
a big lump of coal
for Christmas"?


454
00:23:00.196 --> 00:23:02.049
Pere Noel doesn't
even bring coal, that's Santa.


455
00:23:02.073 --> 00:23:04.284
- Mm-hmm. There's a difference?
- Oh, yeah.


456
00:23:04.325 --> 00:23:07.245
See, Pere Noel is Cajun,
so he speaks French too.


457
00:23:07.287 --> 00:23:10.498
Oh, and he drinks blackberry
wine and eats meat pies.


458
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.977
And my dad is going to be him now
that Mr. Shepherd is retiring.


459
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:15.712
Yes. I've heard about that.
I've been told.


460
00:23:15.753 --> 00:23:17.547
- Okay, buckle up.
- Smile, Mom.


461
00:23:17.589 --> 00:23:19.674
- Oh...
- Oh, and by the way,


462
00:23:19.716 --> 00:23:21.551
we're going
to Robert's Coffee House


463
00:23:21.593 --> 00:23:22.844
and my dad used to work there,

464
00:23:22.886 --> 00:23:25.597
and they have
the best beignets, ever.


465
00:23:25.638 --> 00:23:28.892
- Okay. Beignets, meat pies.
- Mm-hmm.


466
00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:31.477
- Okay, so you're ready to do the whole tour?
- Yeah.


467
00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:33.313
- Let's do it, Mom.
- Let's do this.


468
00:23:38.902 --> 00:23:41.196
- I can come back out for those.
- Oh, no, don't worry.


469
00:23:41.237 --> 00:23:44.199
I can get them. I mean,
it's a family business, right?


470
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.241
Right.

471
00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:56.711
Oh! <i>Attention!</i>

472
00:23:56.753 --> 00:23:58.588
Whoops.

473
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.340
- Well, that's broken.
- I'm so sorry.


474
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:02.300
You know, a warning
might have been nice.


475
00:24:02.342 --> 00:24:04.570
- You don't speak French?
- That's the problem with tourists.


476
00:24:04.594 --> 00:24:06.489
They come through and mess up
the flow of traffic.


477
00:24:06.513 --> 00:24:08.598
Yeah, well, no wonder
you're mowing people over.


478
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.141
- Do you mind if I...? Yep.
- Oh.


479
00:24:10.183 --> 00:24:11.100
Thank you.

480
00:24:11.142 --> 00:24:12.894
So, she knocks over my presents,

481
00:24:12.936 --> 00:24:14.437
she makes fun
of my nerdy glasses...


482
00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:16.356
Well, from one nerd to another,

483
00:24:16.397 --> 00:24:17.565
I think they look cute.

484
00:24:17.607 --> 00:24:19.526
Um... distinguished.

485
00:24:19.567 --> 00:24:21.152
Smart...

486
00:24:21.194 --> 00:24:22.237
I mean.

487
00:24:23.404 --> 00:24:25.073
- But not well-traveled.
- No.


488
00:24:25.114 --> 00:24:26.574
Campbell!
We're setting up.


489
00:24:26.616 --> 00:24:28.910
Yeah, I'm on my way!

490
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.582
<i>♪ You bring out
The holly jolly me... ♪</i>


491
00:24:36.668 --> 00:24:38.586
Okay, good,
if you could tilt it up


492
00:24:38.628 --> 00:24:40.255
towards the Christmas tree.

493
00:24:40.296 --> 00:24:41.798
Yeah.

494
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.093
Okay. Good. Perfect.

495
00:24:45.134 --> 00:24:46.845
Caption time.

496
00:24:46.886 --> 00:24:49.889
I need to find a pen.
Gotta brainstorm.


497
00:24:49.931 --> 00:24:52.433
Oh, Amelia, not on any
of the mayor's important stuff.


498
00:24:52.475 --> 00:24:53.685
Wait, wait, wait!

499
00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:56.020
- Mayor Thomas.
- Yes.


500
00:24:56.062 --> 00:24:58.106
Mayor Thomas,
this is Campbell Wallace.


501
00:24:58.147 --> 00:25:00.316
She's doing the article
about Pere Noel.


502
00:25:00.358 --> 00:25:01.776
Oh, okay.

503
00:25:01.818 --> 00:25:03.903
The mayor
and Everett go way back.


504
00:25:03.945 --> 00:25:05.422
Campbell,
it's a pleasure to meet you.


505
00:25:05.446 --> 00:25:08.616
- And welcome to Sorrento!
- Thank you. Nice to be here.


506
00:25:08.658 --> 00:25:12.871
Absolutely. You know, I think
she should meet Jackson Shepherd.


507
00:25:12.912 --> 00:25:14.956
I think he'd be
a great resource for you.


508
00:25:14.998 --> 00:25:17.542
Actually, she's staying
at his family's cottage.


509
00:25:17.584 --> 00:25:20.003
Ah, there you go.
Meant to be.


510
00:25:20.044 --> 00:25:22.630
He's around here somewhere.

511
00:25:22.672 --> 00:25:24.424
Hey, Jackson!

512
00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:28.011
Come over here!

513
00:25:31.014 --> 00:25:33.391
Jackson Shepherd,
this is Campbell Wallace.


514
00:25:33.433 --> 00:25:35.810
She's the reporter
from the travel magazine.


515
00:25:35.852 --> 00:25:37.520
Ah. Well, <i>bonjour,</i>miss.

516
00:25:37.562 --> 00:25:39.814
<i>Bonjour</i> indeed.

517
00:25:39.856 --> 00:25:42.525
Oh, Mayor Thomas, if you're
wondering why the present I got you


518
00:25:42.567 --> 00:25:46.988
is broken into a million pieces,
that's because of her.


519
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.741
Well, Campbell,
you can ask this rude young man


520
00:25:49.782 --> 00:25:51.993
anything about anything,
he knows it all.


521
00:25:52.035 --> 00:25:53.995
He's the keeper
of all the town records


522
00:25:54.037 --> 00:25:55.705
and he helps us out
when we have visitors.


523
00:25:55.747 --> 00:25:56.998
- Great.
- Okay.


524
00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.392
I just hope I don't
ruin your flow,


525
00:25:58.416 --> 00:25:59.918
what with me
being a tourist, and all.


526
00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:02.003
Well, it was her who started.

527
00:26:02.045 --> 00:26:04.506
I mean, I feel like you
started that before.


528
00:26:04.547 --> 00:26:06.633
- And you'll be staying at the cottage?
- Yeah.


529
00:26:06.674 --> 00:26:09.552
- Excellent.
- I can't tell if they're flirting or fighting.


530
00:26:09.594 --> 00:26:12.138
- Maybe both.
- That's why I put her in the cottage.


531
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.848
You're good with people,
you know that?


532
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.642
Well, it's a gift.
What can I say?


533
00:26:17.644 --> 00:26:20.688
So, Jennifer, I wanted to ask,

534
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.358
what's Everett like, to you?

535
00:26:23.399 --> 00:26:25.109
Um, well...

536
00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:27.320
he's smart and hard-working.

537
00:26:27.362 --> 00:26:29.155
And loving.

538
00:26:29.197 --> 00:26:30.532
Um...

539
00:26:30.573 --> 00:26:32.200
You know, when I met him,

540
00:26:32.242 --> 00:26:35.411
he had just pulled himself
out of a really dark place.


541
00:26:35.453 --> 00:26:41.209
And he's spent the rest of his life
trying to do better, be better.


542
00:26:41.251 --> 00:26:45.463
There's not a lot of people
you can say that about.


543
00:26:45.505 --> 00:26:48.883
And, you know,
he makes me laugh... a lot.


544
00:26:48.925 --> 00:26:52.345
Tsk... I think
I just love him to bits.


545
00:26:52.387 --> 00:26:56.516
Yeah, see, I wish I could
see him the way all of you do.


546
00:26:56.558 --> 00:26:59.602
And I wish he could have been
those things for me.


547
00:27:00.728 --> 00:27:02.397
- Hey!
- Hey.


548
00:27:02.438 --> 00:27:03.731
Perfect timing.

549
00:27:03.773 --> 00:27:05.567
I just set out
the last batch to cool.


550
00:27:05.608 --> 00:27:07.026
- Good day?
- Excellent.


551
00:27:07.068 --> 00:27:08.570
I'm thinking of hiring Campbell.

552
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:11.030
She's a perfect fit
for our little operation here.


553
00:27:11.072 --> 00:27:12.740
- Okay.
- How was your day?


554
00:27:12.782 --> 00:27:14.909
Well, much better
now that you're here.


555
00:27:14.951 --> 00:27:16.327
- Oh.
- Come on, let's eat.


556
00:27:16.369 --> 00:27:18.097
- Well, well, well, okay.
- You too, Campbell.


557
00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:20.915
- Campbell. Come on now.
- Yep.


558
00:27:20.957 --> 00:27:22.917
All right.
Ooh, something smells good.


559
00:27:22.959 --> 00:27:25.920
- Mmm.
- Girls, come on, dinner!


560
00:27:25.962 --> 00:27:29.215
I'm just gonna grab my things
and head out.


561
00:27:29.257 --> 00:27:31.551
You can't leave yet.
Stay for dinner.


562
00:27:31.593 --> 00:27:33.344
Look, there's plenty of food.

563
00:27:33.386 --> 00:27:36.097
I just... I should really get
started on writing my article,


564
00:27:36.139 --> 00:27:38.516
and I don't want to intrude
on family time.


565
00:27:38.558 --> 00:27:40.977
Guess what? After dinner,
we're making wreaths.


566
00:27:41.019 --> 00:27:43.438
It's a family tradition
on the first night off school.


567
00:27:43.479 --> 00:27:45.374
- You can sit by me.
- Uh-uh, she's sitting by me.


568
00:27:45.398 --> 00:27:47.108
We're going
to talk about photography.


569
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.028
Sounds like the girls
already saved a spot for you.


570
00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:52.447
Now, look, this article
is about me, right?


571
00:27:52.489 --> 00:27:54.699
Well, to know my family
<i>is</i> to know me.


572
00:27:56.951 --> 00:27:58.203
Why don't you stay awhile?

573
00:27:59.537 --> 00:28:01.039
How can I say no?

574
00:28:02.999 --> 00:28:04.599
You can just put your stuff
on the chair.


575
00:28:04.626 --> 00:28:05.835
Thank you.

576
00:28:05.877 --> 00:28:08.213
- Mm-mm. Who's first?
- Smells good.


577
00:28:08.254 --> 00:28:09.756
For you.

578
00:28:17.305 --> 00:28:21.351
"This will be
your best Christmas ever."


579
00:28:21.392 --> 00:28:24.395
Hi, Mom.

580
00:28:24.437 --> 00:28:26.272
<i>Hey, baby.
How are you holding up?</i>


581
00:28:26.314 --> 00:28:28.525
Uh... getting settled in.

582
00:28:28.566 --> 00:28:30.443
You know, meeting my father
for the first time,


583
00:28:30.485 --> 00:28:32.445
not telling him
I'm his daughter.


584
00:28:32.487 --> 00:28:35.156
- You haven't told him yet?
<i>- I panicked.</i>


585
00:28:35.198 --> 00:28:37.575
Well, that's totally normal,
sweetheart.


586
00:28:37.617 --> 00:28:38.868
<i>It still feels weird.</i>

587
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.453
It's kind of like lying,
you know?


588
00:28:40.495 --> 00:28:43.289
I mean, it's...
a lot like lying.


589
00:28:43.331 --> 00:28:45.792
<i>Well, it's also a way
of keeping yourself safe</i>


590
00:28:45.834 --> 00:28:47.877
and get to know him better.

591
00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:49.170
How are the girls?

592
00:28:49.212 --> 00:28:50.797
Oh, Mom, they're amazing.

593
00:28:50.839 --> 00:28:53.716
I mean, Amelia is so spunky,

594
00:28:53.758 --> 00:28:57.136
and Mary-Margaret
is just such a moody teenager.


595
00:28:57.178 --> 00:28:59.764
You know, she's trying
to be real cool.


596
00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:02.600
She just, like, reminds me a lot
of myself when I was that age.


597
00:29:02.642 --> 00:29:05.103
And last night we were making
wreaths, and, um...


598
00:29:06.521 --> 00:29:08.815
Oh, hang on, Mom.
Someone's at my door.


599
00:29:08.857 --> 00:29:10.942
It's okay. Go.
Just call me later.


600
00:29:10.984 --> 00:29:12.068
I love you!

601
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.361
Love you.

602
00:29:17.323 --> 00:29:21.619
Well, look who
the reindeer dragged in.


603
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:23.830
Pere Noel doesn't
actually have reindeer.


604
00:29:23.872 --> 00:29:25.582
Oh, yeah?
What does he use, then?


605
00:29:25.623 --> 00:29:27.041
Alligators.

606
00:29:27.083 --> 00:29:29.961
Oh. The Ayutthaya province
has elephants,


607
00:29:30.003 --> 00:29:33.798
the North Pole has reindeers, and Cajun
country has alligators, naturally.


608
00:29:38.011 --> 00:29:39.470
Oh, right. Sorry.

609
00:29:39.512 --> 00:29:41.973
Uh, so, your coffee machine
here is broken,


610
00:29:42.015 --> 00:29:43.683
so I brought you this.

611
00:29:43.725 --> 00:29:45.435
My grandma's recipe.

612
00:29:45.476 --> 00:29:47.478
I hope you like
Cajun eggnog flavor.


613
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.105
Cajun eggnog. Never had it.

614
00:29:49.147 --> 00:29:51.566
Ah. That's a point for me then.

615
00:29:51.608 --> 00:29:53.502
I mean, essentially
it's eggnog instead of creamer,


616
00:29:53.526 --> 00:29:56.279
with nutmeg, cinnamon, cayenne,

617
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:58.114
and a little
imitation rum extract.


618
00:29:58.156 --> 00:30:00.116
Sounds different.

619
00:30:00.158 --> 00:30:02.160
It's a southern
Louisiana tradition, so...


620
00:30:02.202 --> 00:30:03.661
Mmm, don't worry,
I love different.


621
00:30:03.703 --> 00:30:06.998
Believe me, in my line of work,
I get plenty of it.


622
00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.417
- Ever had mopane?
- I have not.


623
00:30:09.459 --> 00:30:12.003
- What is that?
- Worms.


624
00:30:12.045 --> 00:30:14.005
It's a Zimbabwean
Christmas tradition.


625
00:30:14.047 --> 00:30:16.299
That sounds... delicious.

626
00:30:16.341 --> 00:30:18.593
It's actually pretty good.
Almost as good as this coffee.


627
00:30:18.635 --> 00:30:20.178
Glad to hear it.

628
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.597
Hey, I was thinking,
maybe I'd take you on a tour?


629
00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:25.350
You can see the sights.
I mean, it's no Zimbabwe...


630
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:27.519
Actually, I'm tailing
Everett today,


631
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.188
Pere Noel duties,
but maybe you could help me


632
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.606
do some research after lunch?

633
00:30:31.648 --> 00:30:33.942
Sorrento's resident geek
is at your service.


634
00:30:33.983 --> 00:30:35.860
Great, it's a date then.

635
00:30:35.902 --> 00:30:37.195
Um...

636
00:30:37.237 --> 00:30:38.488
Yeah, cheers.

637
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.739
Cheers.

638
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.579
You know, it's a great honor
to take on the mantle


639
00:30:46.621 --> 00:30:48.289
of Pere Noel from Shepherd here,

640
00:30:48.331 --> 00:30:51.167
who's had that distinction
for nearly 30 years.


641
00:30:53.086 --> 00:30:56.798
Now, as my first official act
as Sorrento's new Pere Noel,


642
00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.552
I'm going to hang the first
ornament on the town tree,


643
00:31:00.593 --> 00:31:03.596
as a sign that Christmas
is just around the corner.


644
00:31:06.432 --> 00:31:09.435
Hey, you know,
this is the time of year


645
00:31:09.477 --> 00:31:12.397
where we're supposed to be the
most hospitable and welcoming,


646
00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:14.899
so I'd like to ask
somebody else to help me.


647
00:31:14.941 --> 00:31:19.070
Kind of an honorary Pere Noel
assistant for the season.


648
00:31:19.112 --> 00:31:21.573
Campbell Wallace.
What do you say?


649
00:31:21.614 --> 00:31:22.949
- Uh...
- Go on!


650
00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:24.325
Okay, sure.

651
00:31:24.367 --> 00:31:25.493
- Thank you.
- Anywhere.


652
00:31:25.535 --> 00:31:27.078
- Right here? Yeah?
- Yep.


653
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.289
- Okay.
- There we go. Ta-da!


654
00:31:31.416 --> 00:31:33.001
You didn't have to do that.

655
00:31:33.042 --> 00:31:34.544
Of course I did.
You're our guest.


656
00:31:34.586 --> 00:31:36.462
All right, folks join in!

657
00:31:52.729 --> 00:31:57.192
"Mo' fassa and fassa,
da gator dey came!"


658
00:31:57.233 --> 00:32:01.488
"He whistle and holla
and called dem by name!"


659
00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:04.949
Hey, now, kids,
we have a special visitor,


660
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:07.994
coming all the way from the
magical land of Dallas, Texas.


661
00:32:08.036 --> 00:32:09.454
- Oooh!
- Now, I reckon she's never


662
00:32:09.496 --> 00:32:11.706
even heard this story before,
have you?


663
00:32:11.748 --> 00:32:14.209
I can't say that I have.
Not this version, anyway.


664
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:18.713
Well then, she doesn't even know
the names of Pere Noel's gators.


665
00:32:18.755 --> 00:32:21.132
Should we teach her? Y'all
want to practice your reading?


666
00:32:21.174 --> 00:32:22.509
Yeah!

667
00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.885
All right, come on up here.

668
00:32:23.927 --> 00:32:25.595
- Let's do it.
- Okay.


669
00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:29.641
- Right here. You ready?
- Okay.


670
00:32:29.682 --> 00:32:30.475
Here we go.

671
00:32:30.517 --> 00:32:33.811
"Ha, Gaston! Ha, Tiboy!"

672
00:32:33.853 --> 00:32:36.272
"Ha, Pierre an' Alcee!"

673
00:32:36.314 --> 00:32:38.900
"Gee, Ninette! Gee, Suzette!"

674
00:32:38.942 --> 00:32:41.694
"Celeste an' Renee!"

675
00:32:44.447 --> 00:32:46.342
- Not my best performance.
- Oh, that's all right.


676
00:32:46.366 --> 00:32:48.368
Look, that's for you.
Now you can practice.


677
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:50.995
That's how you get ahold
of Pere Noel on Christmas Eve.


678
00:32:51.037 --> 00:32:53.748
- Thank you.
- And remember your time down here.


679
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.084
All right, now, kids,
how does the story end?


680
00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:58.294
"Merry Christmas to all,

681
00:32:58.336 --> 00:33:01.005
'til I saw you some mo'!"

682
00:33:01.047 --> 00:33:03.258
All right.

683
00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:05.885
Hey, hot chocolate
right over here.


684
00:33:05.927 --> 00:33:08.012
Oooh!

685
00:33:08.054 --> 00:33:09.514
Hi there.

686
00:33:13.518 --> 00:33:15.144
Come in.

687
00:33:16.479 --> 00:33:19.983
Oh, hey.
Glad you could make it.


688
00:33:20.024 --> 00:33:22.443
Wow... festive.

689
00:33:22.485 --> 00:33:25.155
Yeah, I get pretty focused
on my work.


690
00:33:25.196 --> 00:33:27.699
Yeah, I mean, I get it.
Practical.


691
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.242
Ah, what the Japanese
call <i>shibui.</i>


692
00:33:29.284 --> 00:33:30.493
Boring?

693
00:33:30.535 --> 00:33:33.037
Understated.

694
00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:36.374
Oh, hey. So, the town paper
is doing a series on Everett.


695
00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:38.543
Asked me to pull
all the public files on him,


696
00:33:38.585 --> 00:33:41.671
old articles, government files,
photographs.


697
00:33:41.713 --> 00:33:44.174
So I thought maybe you could
use it for your article as well?


698
00:33:44.215 --> 00:33:46.551
That's incredible.
Yeah, thank you.


699
00:33:46.593 --> 00:33:49.470
Ugh! So... I haven't
looked at it yet, but...


700
00:33:49.512 --> 00:33:51.097
that should keep you busy
for a while.


701
00:33:51.139 --> 00:33:53.808
- Yep.
- Feel free to work here as long as you want.


702
00:33:56.144 --> 00:33:59.814
- You want coffee?
- The answer to that question will always be yes.


703
00:33:59.856 --> 00:34:00.899
Okay.

704
00:34:10.617 --> 00:34:12.410
Hey, you want cream or sugar?

705
00:34:12.452 --> 00:34:15.205
Uh, just coffee is fine,
thank you.


706
00:34:17.832 --> 00:34:19.834
This is from the year he left.

707
00:34:32.138 --> 00:34:33.556
All right, here we go.

708
00:34:33.598 --> 00:34:36.267
So, where should we get started?

709
00:34:36.309 --> 00:34:38.019
Uh, actually, I have to go.

710
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:40.939
Sorry, my, uh, my editor
needs a progress report,


711
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.399
so I have to go
and upload some pictures.


712
00:34:43.441 --> 00:34:46.486
But thank you, and, um...
I'll call you?


713
00:34:46.528 --> 00:34:48.863
Yep.

714
00:34:50.323 --> 00:34:51.658
Fine.

715
00:35:15.181 --> 00:35:18.101
She told me about you.
Maybe we'll sit down and visit.


716
00:35:18.142 --> 00:35:20.353
She let me know kind of
what's going on...


717
00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:24.107
I figured, look,
this is something


718
00:35:24.148 --> 00:35:26.484
that I know what I'm talking
about 'cause I've been there.


719
00:35:26.526 --> 00:35:28.246
- You've been there?
- Yeah, and back again.


720
00:35:37.537 --> 00:35:39.330
- Hey.
- Hi.


721
00:35:39.372 --> 00:35:41.374
How'd it go with your boss?

722
00:35:41.416 --> 00:35:43.001
Uh, yeah, good, good.
Yeah, uh...


723
00:35:43.042 --> 00:35:44.878
Just, uh...
just, uh, working away.


724
00:35:44.919 --> 00:35:46.379
Great. Do you care
if I sit down?


725
00:35:46.421 --> 00:35:48.548
Sure. Go ahead.

726
00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.674
Thank you.

727
00:35:49.716 --> 00:35:51.843
- Hey, um...
- Yeah.


728
00:35:51.885 --> 00:35:54.179
Who is that guy that Everett
is talking to outside?


729
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.140
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah, it's the guy he's been counseling.


730
00:35:57.182 --> 00:35:58.982
- Counseling?
- Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't


731
00:35:59.017 --> 00:36:00.685
figure that out
in all your research.


732
00:36:00.727 --> 00:36:04.022
- Hmm.
- You have a little...


733
00:36:04.063 --> 00:36:07.317
Okay, you have a lot of powdered
sugar on your face right there.


734
00:36:07.358 --> 00:36:09.986
Yeah. Yeah, Everett's been
working with the community center.


735
00:36:10.028 --> 00:36:12.947
You know, helping these guys
through hard times


736
00:36:12.989 --> 00:36:16.242
like he went through, says
it's his way of giving back.


737
00:36:16.284 --> 00:36:19.329
- "Like he'd went through"?
- I don't have the full story.


738
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.665
But, you know, his family's
from here and he was born here.


739
00:36:22.707 --> 00:36:24.834
But then he went away
for a few years and so...


740
00:36:24.876 --> 00:36:26.878
Hey!

741
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.881
Oh, careful now. That powdered
sugar will take you out.


742
00:36:29.923 --> 00:36:32.008
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, I hope you didn't fill up too much,


743
00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.511
'cause I saved you
the last meat pies of the day.


744
00:36:34.552 --> 00:36:36.804
- You have one yet?
- Um...


745
00:36:36.846 --> 00:36:38.973
Pirogues, yes, sambooseh, sure.

746
00:36:39.015 --> 00:36:40.683
But a genuine
Louisiana meat pie,


747
00:36:40.725 --> 00:36:42.268
I can't say
that I've had the pleasure.


748
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.812
Good. Jackson, you all right
if I steal her away?


749
00:36:44.854 --> 00:36:46.564
- Yeah, no, not at all.
- All right.


750
00:36:46.606 --> 00:36:48.399
Meat pie's gonna be
a good walking snack.


751
00:36:48.441 --> 00:36:49.818
Walking snack?
Where are we going?


752
00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:52.237
Down to the bayou.
Girls are already there.


753
00:36:52.278 --> 00:36:54.322
I'm gonna give you
a peek behind the curtain.


754
00:36:58.743 --> 00:37:00.328
What's the verdict?

755
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.080
Wow. These really are amazing.

756
00:37:02.121 --> 00:37:04.374
Ha ha! Made from scratch
every day.


757
00:37:04.415 --> 00:37:06.960
- How?
- Get out of bed, make a cup of coffee.


758
00:37:07.001 --> 00:37:08.753
Start on the dough.

759
00:37:08.795 --> 00:37:11.673
I mean, how?
What goes into them?


760
00:37:11.714 --> 00:37:14.050
Oh, a lot of love.

761
00:37:14.092 --> 00:37:16.386
I'm gonna show you something
that's great for the article.


762
00:37:16.427 --> 00:37:17.929
The article, right.

763
00:37:19.931 --> 00:37:24.060
This little skiff
is soon gonna be a sleigh.


764
00:37:24.102 --> 00:37:27.689
The Pere Noel family decorates
this bad boy every year.


765
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.732
You gonna give us a hand?

766
00:37:29.774 --> 00:37:31.192
Do you want me to help?

767
00:37:31.234 --> 00:37:33.862
In case you haven't noticed yet,
I'm giving you


768
00:37:33.903 --> 00:37:36.239
an all-access pass
like you're part of the family.


769
00:37:37.699 --> 00:37:39.742
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

770
00:37:39.784 --> 00:37:42.453
- Dad, can you help me with this a little bit?
- Yep.


771
00:37:44.622 --> 00:37:46.708
Hey.

772
00:37:46.749 --> 00:37:48.751
Decorating not your thing?

773
00:37:48.793 --> 00:37:50.962
I don't like the water so much.

774
00:37:51.004 --> 00:37:53.214
Do you know how many gators
are in there?


775
00:37:53.256 --> 00:37:55.508
- Alligators?
- Aw, don't worry.


776
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.218
Those mean old gators never eat

777
00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.345
one of Pere Noel's girlsl,
they know better.


778
00:37:59.387 --> 00:38:01.931
- But <i>I</i> will!
- Dad, put me down, Dad!


779
00:38:01.973 --> 00:38:03.558
I'll put you down in the water!

780
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.518
She's gator bait!
She's gator bait!


781
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.520
Oh, she escaped.

782
00:38:07.562 --> 00:38:09.856
- Saved your life.
- Whoa!


783
00:38:09.898 --> 00:38:12.775
- I gotcha.
- Thank you.


784
00:38:12.817 --> 00:38:14.861
I know you're looking
for an immersive experience,


785
00:38:14.903 --> 00:38:18.490
but trust me,
going in the bayou ain't it.


786
00:38:18.531 --> 00:38:20.575
Yes. Noted.

787
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.123
Well, don't I just miss
all the fun.


788
00:38:27.165 --> 00:38:30.043
Mom, Campbell almost fell in
the water, but Dad saved her.


789
00:38:30.084 --> 00:38:33.213
- I sure did.
- So that's why you're late.


790
00:38:33.254 --> 00:38:36.508
Well, remember, we have that dinner
we have to cater across town.


791
00:38:36.549 --> 00:38:39.093
- Yeah.
- You girls too, so you're going to have to go change.


792
00:38:39.135 --> 00:38:43.515
Mom, do we have to? I have so many stories to
write down before I forget all the details.


793
00:38:43.556 --> 00:38:46.785
Look, it's gonna be a late night, and I
really don't want you girls here by yourself.


794
00:38:46.809 --> 00:38:48.937
I can watch them.

795
00:38:48.978 --> 00:38:51.189
But, Mom, we do not need
a babysitter.


796
00:38:51.231 --> 00:38:54.234
Oh, I don't babysit.
Don't worry.


797
00:38:54.275 --> 00:38:57.487
No, but we could have,
like, a Christmas sleepover?


798
00:38:57.529 --> 00:39:01.032
And I can give you those
pictures I took today, so...


799
00:39:01.074 --> 00:39:04.494
Yeah... Mom, Dad, please!

800
00:39:04.536 --> 00:39:06.329
Yes, okay, fine. Yes.

801
00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:08.414
All right, but they gotta be
in bed by 10:00.


802
00:39:08.456 --> 00:39:10.959
Not a minute later!

803
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.377
- You got it.
- All right.


804
00:39:12.418 --> 00:39:13.878
And you need to go change.

805
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.422
I do, yeah.
Wow, you look great.


806
00:39:16.464 --> 00:39:18.383
- Is that what you're going to wear?
- Yes.


807
00:39:20.718 --> 00:39:24.264
I mean, ice-cream snowman.
It's brilliant.


808
00:39:24.305 --> 00:39:27.600
It's the closest we can get
to real snow around here, so...


809
00:39:27.642 --> 00:39:30.812
Oh! Think he's melting.

810
00:39:30.854 --> 00:39:32.564
Oh, here, let me help.

811
00:39:34.315 --> 00:39:36.192
Oh, yeah.

812
00:39:36.234 --> 00:39:38.444
Um...

813
00:39:38.486 --> 00:39:41.239
I think this is jammed.

814
00:39:43.825 --> 00:39:46.035
Here, let me see it.

815
00:39:48.121 --> 00:39:49.998
- Oh, my God.
- Look!


816
00:39:50.039 --> 00:39:52.000
Oh, my God!

817
00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:54.085
- I still don't appreciate it.
- Hair!


818
00:39:54.127 --> 00:39:57.672
No!

819
00:40:00.049 --> 00:40:02.594
Get off!

820
00:40:03.887 --> 00:40:05.054
<i>Okay, smile.</i>

821
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:07.724
Nice!

822
00:40:07.765 --> 00:40:08.892
Oh, those are good.

823
00:40:11.019 --> 00:40:13.021
So, since I'm
the writer in the family,


824
00:40:13.062 --> 00:40:14.272
I do the Christmas cards

825
00:40:14.314 --> 00:40:16.107
and Mary-Margaret
makes the gifts.


826
00:40:16.149 --> 00:40:17.442
Wait, you made these?

827
00:40:17.484 --> 00:40:20.236
Yeah, it's not a big deal.

828
00:40:20.278 --> 00:40:22.780
That's why
you're so good with the camera.


829
00:40:22.822 --> 00:40:25.116
Like I said,
you've got a great eye.


830
00:40:25.158 --> 00:40:27.911
Oh... it's whatever.

831
00:40:27.952 --> 00:40:30.788
You know it's okay
to like things, right?


832
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:33.917
Like photography, for example.

833
00:40:33.958 --> 00:40:35.877
Yeah, but it's not cool.

834
00:40:35.919 --> 00:40:37.754
I think it's cool!

835
00:40:37.795 --> 00:40:40.924
And I have made a career
doing it, so...


836
00:40:40.965 --> 00:40:43.134
maybe give me that one?

837
00:40:43.176 --> 00:40:44.469
Fine.

838
00:40:45.845 --> 00:40:47.639
I do like it.

839
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.892
But most people
will see it as...


840
00:40:50.934 --> 00:40:54.020
like a teenage girl,
always on her phone, so...


841
00:40:54.062 --> 00:40:56.856
Well, maybe you just need
a real camera.


842
00:40:56.898 --> 00:40:58.650
You're just saying
this stuff to be nice.


843
00:40:58.691 --> 00:41:00.276
You do this stuff for real.

844
00:41:00.318 --> 00:41:03.780
Yeah, but, you know,
even when you do it for real,


845
00:41:03.822 --> 00:41:05.448
you wonder if you're any good.

846
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:09.202
Like, for instance,
I wasn't sure


847
00:41:09.244 --> 00:41:11.913
I wanted to take this assignment
and come here to Sorrento.


848
00:41:11.955 --> 00:41:14.749
- I was nervous.
- Really?


849
00:41:14.791 --> 00:41:18.378
Sure. I mean,
being scared and anxious


850
00:41:18.419 --> 00:41:21.422
doesn't just go away
because you get older.


851
00:41:21.464 --> 00:41:24.968
You just learn to not let
those feelings stop you


852
00:41:25.009 --> 00:41:26.761
and go after it anyway.

853
00:41:30.765 --> 00:41:34.269
And sometimes the stuff that
really scares you the most


854
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.355
ends up being the best thing
that's ever happened.


855
00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.862
- Deep.
- Thanks.


856
00:41:43.903 --> 00:41:45.488
Yeah, it was pretty deep.

857
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.491
Like, hit this road
and it was like...


858
00:41:48.533 --> 00:41:51.995
I'm doin' my thing.

859
00:41:52.036 --> 00:41:53.580
<i>It was so much fun.</i>

860
00:41:53.621 --> 00:41:54.831
<i>Do they know yet?</i>

861
00:41:54.873 --> 00:41:56.249
No, still Jennifer.

862
00:41:56.291 --> 00:41:57.709
The moment hasn't felt right

863
00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.336
and I still have
so many questions.


864
00:42:00.378 --> 00:42:03.548
I feel kind of guilty, and I
know I have to tell him, but...


865
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.176
<i>Remember, you're in control
of how this goes.</i>


866
00:42:06.217 --> 00:42:08.011
I know, Dad,
but it's nice to hear.


867
00:42:08.052 --> 00:42:09.846
Campbell, popcorn's ready!

868
00:42:09.888 --> 00:42:12.182
Oh, I gotta go,
a movie's starting.


869
00:42:12.223 --> 00:42:14.058
I told them about
our movie night tradition,


870
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.352
and they wanted
to do it too, so, um...


871
00:42:16.394 --> 00:42:19.189
I miss you both so much.
I'll call you later.


872
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.566
<i>- Love you.
- Miss you, kiddo.</i>


873
00:42:21.608 --> 00:42:24.277
I love you, bye. Bye.

874
00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:27.197
<i>A merry Christmas to you! I
hope you succeeded yesterday.</i>


875
00:42:27.238 --> 00:42:29.616
<i>I'm afraid it's not
a very pleasant one for you.</i>


876
00:42:29.657 --> 00:42:32.035
<i>But will you allow me
to ask your pardon?</i>


877
00:42:32.076 --> 00:42:36.372
<i>And would you be good enough
to put me down?</i>


878
00:42:36.414 --> 00:42:38.875
<i>Lord bless my soul.
My dear Mr. Scrooge...</i>


879
00:42:38.917 --> 00:42:40.919
We're home. Anyone still...?

880
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.755
<i>- Not a farthing less, sir.
- My dear sir!</i>


881
00:42:43.796 --> 00:42:47.300
<i>- I'm afraid there are many backpayments included in it.
- My dear Mr. Scrooge!</i>


882
00:42:47.342 --> 00:42:49.719
<i>You come round and see me.
You will come round?</i>


883
00:42:49.761 --> 00:42:51.221
<i>Oh, we will, we will!</i>

884
00:42:54.432 --> 00:42:56.351
You're thinking about her,
aren't you?


885
00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:58.853
More than ever.

886
00:43:02.398 --> 00:43:03.775
You think we should
wake them up?


887
00:43:03.817 --> 00:43:05.360
No, no, no, let them sleep.

888
00:43:25.255 --> 00:43:28.258
Hi. Merry Christmas Eve.

889
00:43:28.299 --> 00:43:30.635
Brought the coffee this time.

890
00:43:30.677 --> 00:43:32.804
And this.

891
00:43:32.846 --> 00:43:35.139
Thought it might bring you
a little Christmas cheer.


892
00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:36.641
Thank you very much.

893
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.186
Are you okay?

894
00:43:42.772 --> 00:43:44.232
What are you doing here?

895
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.235
I brought you
the Christmas tree.


896
00:43:47.277 --> 00:43:49.445
And the coffee.

897
00:43:49.487 --> 00:43:53.491
I mean, what are you doing
here in Sorrento?


898
00:43:53.533 --> 00:43:56.327
I'm writing a story.
You know that.


899
00:43:56.369 --> 00:43:58.371
That's not
all you're doing, Campbell.


900
00:43:59.831 --> 00:44:00.915
What do you mean?

901
00:44:02.709 --> 00:44:06.462
You're not here to write
a story, <i>you</i> are the story.


902
00:44:06.504 --> 00:44:08.506
You're her.

903
00:44:08.548 --> 00:44:11.217
You're Everett Bergeron's
other daughter.


904
00:44:19.434 --> 00:44:20.894
It's true, isn't it?

905
00:44:20.935 --> 00:44:22.729
You're Everett's daughter.

906
00:44:25.315 --> 00:44:27.108
C
-Campbell.

907
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.443
Campbell!

908
00:44:37.994 --> 00:44:39.787
Hey, Campbell,
will you slow down?


909
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:41.432
- You're such a fast walker.
- Do you need something?


910
00:44:41.456 --> 00:44:43.726
- Yeah, I want to talk to you.
- There's nothing to talk about.


911
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.085
- It's between me and my dad.
- Ah, see, I knew it!


912
00:44:46.127 --> 00:44:48.087
Yeah, okay, fine,
I'm Everett's daughter.


913
00:44:48.129 --> 00:44:49.923
- He doesn't know, does he?
- No, he doesn't.


914
00:44:49.964 --> 00:44:51.859
I mean, he knows that
he has a daughter somewhere,


915
00:44:51.883 --> 00:44:54.260
but he doesn't know that I'm...

916
00:44:54.302 --> 00:44:57.055
- How do you know?
- I'm the town's sacred record keeper.


917
00:44:57.096 --> 00:45:00.266
I know all, and you took
the file from my office.


918
00:45:00.308 --> 00:45:03.186
I looked at the backup...
three daughters.


919
00:45:03.228 --> 00:45:05.939
- And then I did some digging on the internet.
- Some?


920
00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.625
Okay, I did a lot of digging
on the internet,


921
00:45:07.649 --> 00:45:09.484
and I put the pieces together.

922
00:45:09.526 --> 00:45:12.028
- You're such a nerd.
- It takes one to know one, doesn't it?


923
00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:14.906
Well, now you know.
Here's your file.


924
00:45:17.659 --> 00:45:19.077
You better not be following me.

925
00:45:19.118 --> 00:45:20.995
Hey, I just wanna know
why you're doing this.


926
00:45:21.037 --> 00:45:22.997
Because I want to know him.

927
00:45:23.039 --> 00:45:27.252
- I want to know the real him.
- And what have you learned?


928
00:45:27.293 --> 00:45:28.419
Not much.

929
00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:32.465
We've been doing
all the Pere Noel stuff together


930
00:45:32.507 --> 00:45:35.510
and hanging out with the family
and we've had talks, sure,


931
00:45:35.552 --> 00:45:38.763
but we haven't, you know,
sat down and, one-on-one...


932
00:45:38.805 --> 00:45:41.224
Okay, so,
what's holding you back?


933
00:45:41.266 --> 00:45:44.435
Okay, fine, yeah,
maybe I'm a little scared.


934
00:45:44.477 --> 00:45:48.815
I was scared because I didn't
want him to know who I was,


935
00:45:48.857 --> 00:45:52.152
and then I was scared because,
you know, if he knew,


936
00:45:52.193 --> 00:45:54.088
he might not tell me the truth
about why he left.


937
00:45:54.112 --> 00:45:57.615
And now I'm scared because...

938
00:45:57.657 --> 00:45:59.784
you know, I like him.

939
00:45:59.826 --> 00:46:02.787
And maybe I don't <i>want</i>
to know the truth.


940
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:05.498
He seems like... a good guy.

941
00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.960
And... I'm so glad
that my sisters


942
00:46:09.002 --> 00:46:12.297
have a loving
and present father,


943
00:46:12.338 --> 00:46:14.757
but I just...

944
00:46:14.799 --> 00:46:17.177
I... I have so many questions
about the past


945
00:46:17.218 --> 00:46:19.846
and they're really hard to ask.

946
00:46:19.888 --> 00:46:22.098
I think I know someone
that can help.


947
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.810
So, where do we start?

948
00:46:25.852 --> 00:46:27.145
Bit of town history?

949
00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:29.689
We were named
after Sorrento, Italy,


950
00:46:29.731 --> 00:46:34.736
because a German railroad tycoon brought
his wife there on their anniversary.


951
00:46:34.777 --> 00:46:36.863
Honeymoon, actually.

952
00:46:36.905 --> 00:46:38.990
- Nerd.
- You know I can hear you?


953
00:46:39.032 --> 00:46:42.952
Actually, um, I wanted to
ask you about Everett Bergeron?


954
00:46:42.994 --> 00:46:44.579
Just background stuff, you know.

955
00:46:44.621 --> 00:46:45.997
I know he grew up here.

956
00:46:46.039 --> 00:46:48.541
I heard you were
friends as kids.


957
00:46:48.583 --> 00:46:51.085
Sure were. Thick as thieves.

958
00:46:51.127 --> 00:46:53.838
Yeah, he went away after school,

959
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.840
and he only came back
when his dad got sick


960
00:46:55.882 --> 00:46:58.676
and later passed away.

961
00:46:58.718 --> 00:47:00.553
That messed up Everett
really bad.


962
00:47:00.595 --> 00:47:03.306
- How so?
- Well, he was broke.


963
00:47:03.348 --> 00:47:05.767
And when I say broke,
I don't mean money, I...


964
00:47:05.808 --> 00:47:08.186
Well, I do mean money,
but I also mean


965
00:47:08.228 --> 00:47:10.146
that something inside of him
was broke.


966
00:47:10.188 --> 00:47:11.689
And I know that because
at the time,


967
00:47:11.731 --> 00:47:14.025
something inside me
was broke too.


968
00:47:14.067 --> 00:47:15.735
I'd just gotten back
from a deployment,


969
00:47:15.777 --> 00:47:17.487
and I hit rock bottom.

970
00:47:17.529 --> 00:47:20.865
So in a way you two were meant
to find each other again.


971
00:47:20.907 --> 00:47:22.575
That's exactly right.

972
00:47:22.617 --> 00:47:24.369
We were both washing dishes

973
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:26.579
over at old lady Robert's
restaurant,


974
00:47:26.621 --> 00:47:29.707
and even though it was the worst
time in Everett's life,


975
00:47:29.749 --> 00:47:32.210
he always
had time for me, always.


976
00:47:32.252 --> 00:47:35.380
He's the reason
I am in the place I am today.


977
00:47:35.421 --> 00:47:38.591
Did he ever say anything
about that time he was away,


978
00:47:38.633 --> 00:47:40.260
any idea what happened?

979
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:42.387
Only that he had to get
his life together.


980
00:47:42.428 --> 00:47:46.057
He always said he didn't want
to be the man his father was.


981
00:47:46.099 --> 00:47:48.893
Uh... maybe that last part
should be off the record.


982
00:47:48.935 --> 00:47:50.728
It's all off the record,
don't worry.


983
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.105
Okay.

984
00:47:52.146 --> 00:47:53.982
Well, fast-forward a bit.

985
00:47:54.023 --> 00:47:55.733
He worked his way up on the job

986
00:47:55.775 --> 00:47:59.404
and inherited old lady Robert's
recipes when she passed away.


987
00:47:59.445 --> 00:48:01.906
He started a business,
married Jennifer,


988
00:48:01.948 --> 00:48:03.783
had two beautiful girls.

989
00:48:03.825 --> 00:48:06.661
Between you and me, he's been
acting a little different


990
00:48:06.703 --> 00:48:08.830
since he was named Pere Noel.

991
00:48:08.872 --> 00:48:12.417
He actually tried
to turn the honor down.


992
00:48:12.458 --> 00:48:15.086
And I've been thinking,
maybe the stuff...


993
00:48:15.128 --> 00:48:17.046
the stuff with his dad
and his family


994
00:48:17.088 --> 00:48:18.715
had something to do with it.

995
00:48:26.472 --> 00:48:28.183
So, should I talk first,
or will you?


996
00:48:28.224 --> 00:48:31.102
The suspense is killing me.

997
00:48:31.144 --> 00:48:34.355
It's just, I didn't know
about his father getting sick


998
00:48:34.397 --> 00:48:36.774
and about him wanting
to come back


999
00:48:36.816 --> 00:48:40.236
or turning down Pere Noel.

1000
00:48:40.278 --> 00:48:42.947
Do you ever feel like
getting more information


1001
00:48:42.989 --> 00:48:44.908
just makes you more confused?

1002
00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:47.368
Yeah. But I think
you and I both know


1003
00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.122
there's only one way
you're gonna find out.


1004
00:48:51.164 --> 00:48:53.041
By spending time with your dad.

1005
00:48:53.082 --> 00:48:54.876
All right, merry Christmas.
Thank you.


1006
00:48:54.918 --> 00:48:57.337
Hey, Joe, what are you
going for today?


1007
00:48:59.047 --> 00:49:01.049
Yeah. Yeah.

1008
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.800
You're right.

1009
00:49:02.842 --> 00:49:04.344
Five, ten.

1010
00:49:04.385 --> 00:49:06.471
Thank you, Cindy,
merry Christmas to you.


1011
00:49:06.513 --> 00:49:08.640
Hey, Everett,
how you doing up there?


1012
00:49:08.681 --> 00:49:11.327
Boy, I tell ya, I'm sorry Jennifer
took the girls Christmas shopping.


1013
00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:14.020
- I'm flying solo up here!
- Funny you say that.


1014
00:49:14.062 --> 00:49:17.148
Campbell was just telling me that she
wants to learn how the food truck works.


1015
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:18.858
- Really?
- Yeah, uh-huh.


1016
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.152
- I sure was.
- Well, get up here, Campbell.


1017
00:49:21.194 --> 00:49:22.987
I could use
all the help I can get.


1018
00:49:23.029 --> 00:49:25.073
- The best research is hands on.
- That's true.


1019
00:49:25.114 --> 00:49:26.324
What are you looking for?

1020
00:49:26.366 --> 00:49:28.618
- Okay, got it.
- See ya, Everett.


1021
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.286
All right, you be good.

1022
00:49:30.328 --> 00:49:32.789
Meat? Meat, just regular meat.
Okay, that's $4.00.


1023
00:49:32.831 --> 00:49:34.374
- Okay.
- Hey, all right, get comfy.


1024
00:49:34.415 --> 00:49:36.209
- It's hot in the kitchen here.
- Yep.


1025
00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:38.837
You run the window.
Uh, I'll fill the orders.


1026
00:49:38.878 --> 00:49:41.840
There's your cash box.
Four bucks a pie.


1027
00:49:41.881 --> 00:49:43.550
Hi.

1028
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:49.865
- What else you got?
- Two meats, two sweets.


1029
00:49:49.889 --> 00:49:51.325
- Two meats, two sweets.
- Thank you, sir.


1030
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:53.184
That's for you.
Have a merry Christmas.


1031
00:49:54.143 --> 00:49:56.312
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.


1032
00:49:56.354 --> 00:49:58.314
How's, uh... had fun
shopping with the kids?


1033
00:49:58.356 --> 00:49:59.983
Yeah, I just thought
I'd break away


1034
00:50:00.024 --> 00:50:01.693
and see how Everett was doing.

1035
00:50:01.734 --> 00:50:04.154
<i>Tout de suite!</i>

1036
00:50:04.195 --> 00:50:06.006
- See what I did there?
- Yeah, that was pretty cool.


1037
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:07.782
Hey, Karen, how are you doing?

1038
00:50:07.824 --> 00:50:09.367
Those two seem to be
getting along.


1039
00:50:09.409 --> 00:50:11.870
Yeah, which is a good thing.

1040
00:50:11.911 --> 00:50:14.080
Why is that?

1041
00:50:14.122 --> 00:50:16.916
Well... 'cause Campbell's
here all alone, you know,


1042
00:50:16.958 --> 00:50:20.420
and Christmas,
and Everett's like a father.


1043
00:50:21.838 --> 00:50:24.382
Figure. A father figure.

1044
00:50:24.424 --> 00:50:26.092
Which is good,

1045
00:50:26.134 --> 00:50:28.219
you know,
'cause it's Christmas time.


1046
00:50:28.261 --> 00:50:29.596
Wait, what do you know?

1047
00:50:29.637 --> 00:50:32.265
I don't know,
is there something to know?


1048
00:50:32.307 --> 00:50:34.267
I think you know there is.

1049
00:50:35.727 --> 00:50:36.936
I may know something.

1050
00:50:36.978 --> 00:50:38.730
Thank goodness.

1051
00:50:38.771 --> 00:50:42.317
I thought I was going
to explode keeping that secret.


1052
00:50:42.358 --> 00:50:44.068
So you're responsible for this?

1053
00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:45.487
Sorry, I didn't mean
to skip you.


1054
00:50:45.528 --> 00:50:47.071
She didn't count right.

1055
00:50:47.113 --> 00:50:49.240
Well, I just didn't want
Campbell to miss out


1056
00:50:49.282 --> 00:50:51.242
on something that could be
potentially great.


1057
00:50:53.328 --> 00:50:54.829
Nah, I'm kidding.

1058
00:50:54.871 --> 00:50:57.290
Come on, now, merry Christmas.

1059
00:50:57.332 --> 00:50:58.875
I'm gonna need your help.

1060
00:50:58.917 --> 00:51:01.377
But we have to keep it
a secret until Campbell's ready.


1061
00:51:02.879 --> 00:51:04.255
Deal.

1062
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.637
Better count her money
real quick, 'cause I don't know.


1063
00:51:10.678 --> 00:51:11.846
You're doing good, though.

1064
00:51:21.898 --> 00:51:23.274
Oooh!

1065
00:51:23.316 --> 00:51:25.401
- Thank you.
- There you go. Cheers.


1066
00:51:25.443 --> 00:51:27.153
Good day, thanks for the help.

1067
00:51:27.195 --> 00:51:28.530
Of course.

1068
00:51:32.992 --> 00:51:34.661
So, you do this every time?

1069
00:51:34.702 --> 00:51:37.080
Oh, food truck goes out
about twice a week,


1070
00:51:37.121 --> 00:51:39.958
but at Christmas time, the demand
is like you wouldn't believe.


1071
00:51:39.999 --> 00:51:43.127
Oh, I believe it.

1072
00:51:43.169 --> 00:51:46.172
Um... I heard something
about a secret ingredient?


1073
00:51:46.214 --> 00:51:48.258
Any chance I might
pry it out of you?


1074
00:51:48.299 --> 00:51:50.552
Well, I could tell ya,

1075
00:51:50.593 --> 00:51:52.762
but then I'd have to
feed you to the gators.


1076
00:51:54.264 --> 00:51:57.475
Sorry, that's
a Bergeron family secret.


1077
00:51:57.517 --> 00:51:59.769
Yeah. Do you mind if I
ask you a few questions?


1078
00:51:59.811 --> 00:52:02.146
We haven't had the chance
to do that yet.


1079
00:52:02.188 --> 00:52:04.524
- Now's a good time.
- Okay.


1080
00:52:05.817 --> 00:52:07.694
Um...

1081
00:52:07.735 --> 00:52:10.029
Well, how did you meet
your wife, Jennifer?


1082
00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:11.698
Oh, uh...

1083
00:52:11.739 --> 00:52:14.325
at the supermarket,
if you can believe it.


1084
00:52:14.367 --> 00:52:15.994
She was a cashier,
and I was making a run


1085
00:52:16.035 --> 00:52:17.346
for a restaurant
I was working for.


1086
00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:18.705
Oh, old lady Robert's?

1087
00:52:20.623 --> 00:52:23.168
I forget sometimes
I'm talking to a reporter.


1088
00:52:23.209 --> 00:52:26.880
Well, anyway, they said, "Bring
back as many onions as you can,"


1089
00:52:26.921 --> 00:52:30.425
so there I am pushing a cart full of
nothing but onions up to her register,


1090
00:52:30.466 --> 00:52:34.345
and, I mean, it was weird for
sure, and we laughed about it.


1091
00:52:34.387 --> 00:52:38.016
And then she threw in
a chocolate candy bar.


1092
00:52:38.057 --> 00:52:39.142
For free.

1093
00:52:39.184 --> 00:52:40.894
And she said...

1094
00:52:40.935 --> 00:52:45.190
"We all need to treat ourselves
every now and again."


1095
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:49.194
Next day, I go back to
the store, buy her a candy bar,


1096
00:52:49.235 --> 00:52:50.778
ask her out on a date.

1097
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.824
And the rest,
as they say, is history.


1098
00:52:54.866 --> 00:52:57.702
Oh, speaking of history,

1099
00:52:57.744 --> 00:53:00.455
I heard there were
a handful of years,


1100
00:53:00.497 --> 00:53:03.750
uh, that you lived in Texas.

1101
00:53:03.791 --> 00:53:05.418
That's where I live.

1102
00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.837
I... I was born in Houston,

1103
00:53:07.879 --> 00:53:10.256
but, um, we moved to Dallas
when I was a kid.


1104
00:53:10.298 --> 00:53:11.925
- Really?
- Yeah.


1105
00:53:15.053 --> 00:53:18.264
Everett, I, um...

1106
00:53:24.229 --> 00:53:25.939
I-I was wondering
if you would teach me


1107
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.482
how to make a meat pie sometime.

1108
00:53:27.524 --> 00:53:31.110
Me and the girls
are way ahead of you.


1109
00:53:31.152 --> 00:53:32.904
- Great.
- You'll see.


1110
00:53:32.946 --> 00:53:34.781
Good.

1111
00:53:34.823 --> 00:53:37.325
Um, "We all need to..."

1112
00:53:37.367 --> 00:53:38.928
- Treat ourselves.
- "...treat ourselves..."


1113
00:53:38.952 --> 00:53:40.954
- Every now and again.
- "...every now and again."


1114
00:53:40.995 --> 00:53:42.455
- Words to live by.
- You do still?


1115
00:53:42.497 --> 00:53:44.999
- Oh, yeah.
- ♪ <i>And I wonder if you ♪</i>


1116
00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:47.752
Very sweet. <i>-♪ Could
make My dreams come true ♪</i>


1117
00:53:47.794 --> 00:53:49.420
<i>♪ And spend it</i>

1118
00:53:49.462 --> 00:53:53.007
<i>♪ Here with me</i>

1119
00:53:57.762 --> 00:54:00.139
All right, Campbell. What
do you know about meat pies?


1120
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:03.351
I understand there's
a meat component


1121
00:54:03.393 --> 00:54:05.228
and a pie component.

1122
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:07.146
- And they're delicious.
- The best.


1123
00:54:07.188 --> 00:54:08.940
- Yes.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?


1124
00:54:08.982 --> 00:54:11.025
- Baking boot camp?
- Baking boot camp.


1125
00:54:11.067 --> 00:54:12.485
- I'll get the aprons.
- Oh.


1126
00:54:12.527 --> 00:54:14.487
- It's a real thing.
- It's a thing, okay, yeah.


1127
00:54:14.529 --> 00:54:17.115
- For you.
- Thank you.


1128
00:54:20.326 --> 00:54:24.622
Thank you. Lookie there.

1129
00:54:24.664 --> 00:54:26.416
- All right.
- Beautiful.


1130
00:54:26.457 --> 00:54:30.128
Not too tight.

1131
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:32.839
Hu-hu-humm!

1132
00:54:32.881 --> 00:54:36.551
All right.
First things first.


1133
00:54:36.593 --> 00:54:39.929
- Let's talk dough.
- Ooooh!


1134
00:54:41.806 --> 00:54:43.349
Ohh!

1135
00:54:43.391 --> 00:54:45.059
Prep your surface.
Good, good, good.


1136
00:54:45.101 --> 00:54:46.936
- Nice and even.
- Now the dough.


1137
00:54:46.978 --> 00:54:49.439
Grab a baseball.
Perfect, just like that.


1138
00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.524
Okay, now, let's get
that thing flat.


1139
00:54:51.566 --> 00:54:53.193
- That's a shaper.
- Oh.


1140
00:54:53.234 --> 00:54:55.487
<i>Wisht!</i>

1141
00:54:55.528 --> 00:54:57.614
- <i>Voilà!</i>
- Hey!


1142
00:54:57.655 --> 00:54:59.616
Time to fill 'em up!

1143
00:54:59.657 --> 00:55:01.618
Ooh, is this
secret ingredient time?


1144
00:55:01.659 --> 00:55:03.953
Family only, remember the rules.

1145
00:55:03.995 --> 00:55:05.079
Okay!

1146
00:55:07.165 --> 00:55:08.750
Moment of truth...

1147
00:55:10.168 --> 00:55:11.294
Mmm!

1148
00:55:11.336 --> 00:55:13.087
- Ten!
- Okay!


1149
00:55:13.129 --> 00:55:17.509
You couldn't have made this
better if you were one of us.


1150
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.887
Oh, let's take a photo. We can generate
some buzz for Christmas Eve tomorrow.


1151
00:55:20.929 --> 00:55:23.556
- Like that? Gr-Grab on.
- Smile!


1152
00:55:23.598 --> 00:55:25.308
- How's that?
- Perfect.


1153
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.351
- Good?
- And smile!


1154
00:55:26.392 --> 00:55:28.019
Ha ha!

1155
00:55:28.061 --> 00:55:29.896
Good. Perfect.

1156
00:55:29.938 --> 00:55:32.023
All right.

1157
00:55:32.065 --> 00:55:36.444
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, let's go compose the ultimate post for mom.


1158
00:55:36.486 --> 00:55:38.238
- I'm taking this with me!
- Okay.


1159
00:55:38.279 --> 00:55:39.906
Yeah, don't you worry
about a thing.


1160
00:55:39.948 --> 00:55:42.867
- We'll clean up, yeah.
- Thanks, Dad!


1161
00:55:44.536 --> 00:55:46.037
Hey, thanks for sticking around.

1162
00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:47.288
Appreciate it.

1163
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.041
Uh, I know it's late,

1164
00:55:50.083 --> 00:55:52.669
but, um, I have a few more
questions for you


1165
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:54.337
if you don't mind?

1166
00:55:54.379 --> 00:55:56.589
- Sure.
- Why don't we talk about,


1167
00:55:56.631 --> 00:55:59.300
um... you being Pere Noel?

1168
00:55:59.342 --> 00:56:03.471
- Yeah, sure.
- He's sort of the ultimate father figure, right?


1169
00:56:03.513 --> 00:56:06.391
Yeah. You could say that.

1170
00:56:06.432 --> 00:56:10.812
How does it feel to be
honored in that way?


1171
00:56:10.854 --> 00:56:13.690
Well, uh, I mean, I've had a...

1172
00:56:13.731 --> 00:56:15.525
a difficult family life.

1173
00:56:15.567 --> 00:56:16.901
You know, my own father,

1174
00:56:16.943 --> 00:56:19.529
he... he wasn't the greatest,

1175
00:56:19.571 --> 00:56:21.406
and I made some mistakes

1176
00:56:21.447 --> 00:56:22.824
concerning my family,

1177
00:56:22.866 --> 00:56:24.534
but, you know, now I would do

1178
00:56:24.576 --> 00:56:26.411
anything to make things right.

1179
00:56:26.452 --> 00:56:28.955
Anything. Huh.

1180
00:56:28.997 --> 00:56:32.417
Now, listen, we are talking
about Pere Noel the character,


1181
00:56:32.458 --> 00:56:34.002
the festival, all that, right?

1182
00:56:34.043 --> 00:56:36.462
Yeah, it's
a human interest piece,


1183
00:56:36.504 --> 00:56:40.425
and, um, you're
a very interesting human.


1184
00:56:40.466 --> 00:56:42.343
Okay.

1185
00:56:44.345 --> 00:56:47.891
It's just that I have
done a little digging.


1186
00:56:47.932 --> 00:56:51.311
Really?
What did you find out?


1187
00:56:53.563 --> 00:56:56.566
Well, this is a sight.

1188
00:56:56.608 --> 00:56:58.735
Where are the other two
little elves that live here?


1189
00:56:58.776 --> 00:57:03.031
I hope they didn't leave you
both all this mess.


1190
00:57:03.072 --> 00:57:06.284
They're upstairs composing
the ultimate post.


1191
00:57:06.326 --> 00:57:07.702
Well, don't mind me.

1192
00:57:07.744 --> 00:57:09.537
I just brought some things
for the truck.


1193
00:57:09.579 --> 00:57:11.080
No, we were just wrapping up.

1194
00:57:11.122 --> 00:57:13.416
I'm sure Campbell's
gotta get back to the cottage


1195
00:57:13.458 --> 00:57:15.418
and work on that article.

1196
00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.337
Yeah, yes, yep.

1197
00:57:19.422 --> 00:57:21.466
Lots to catch up on.

1198
00:57:21.508 --> 00:57:23.259
Thank you for a great evening.

1199
00:57:23.301 --> 00:57:25.345
Mm-hmm.

1200
00:57:25.386 --> 00:57:26.513
I'll see you tomorrow.

1201
00:57:26.554 --> 00:57:28.223
- Bye.
- Bye.


1202
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.063
<i>Hey, Mom, do you have a minute?</i>

1203
00:57:35.104 --> 00:57:37.190
<i>Sure. What's going on?</i>

1204
00:57:37.232 --> 00:57:41.110
Well, uh... I learned how
to make meat pies tonight.


1205
00:57:41.152 --> 00:57:42.779
That's a first.

1206
00:57:42.821 --> 00:57:44.656
And I'm heading back
to the cottage


1207
00:57:44.697 --> 00:57:46.950
to write my article.

1208
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:48.159
Hey, um...

1209
00:57:49.828 --> 00:57:51.496
why did Everett leave?

1210
00:57:51.538 --> 00:57:53.957
Campbell, you know this.

1211
00:57:53.998 --> 00:57:55.083
Yeah, sure.

1212
00:57:55.124 --> 00:57:56.292
Uh, just...

1213
00:57:56.334 --> 00:57:58.211
just walk me through it.

1214
00:57:58.253 --> 00:57:59.796
<i>We were young</i>

1215
00:57:59.838 --> 00:58:02.674
and Everett wasn't ready
to be a father.


1216
00:58:02.715 --> 00:58:05.301
I mean, I wasn't ready
to be a mother either,


1217
00:58:05.343 --> 00:58:06.928
but it just hit him hard,

1218
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.222
<i>and when you were two,
he lost his job,</i>


1219
00:58:09.264 --> 00:58:11.266
<i>and he was a wreck.</i>

1220
00:58:11.307 --> 00:58:14.102
Anyway, after he left,

1221
00:58:14.143 --> 00:58:16.521
<i>it was just like
he didn't want to be found.</i>


1222
00:58:16.563 --> 00:58:18.690
<i>So I stopped trying.</i>

1223
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:22.944
You don't think maybe
he wanted to come back?


1224
00:58:22.986 --> 00:58:25.780
Well, if he wanted to come back,
he would have.


1225
00:58:25.822 --> 00:58:27.782
<i>Why? Did he say something?</i>

1226
00:58:27.824 --> 00:58:31.870
No. No, not officially.

1227
00:58:31.911 --> 00:58:34.789
I'm still trying
to get the truth out of him.


1228
00:58:34.831 --> 00:58:38.293
- You want my two cents?
- Sure.


1229
00:58:38.334 --> 00:58:40.962
<i>He's never going to spill
his guts to a journalist,</i>


1230
00:58:41.004 --> 00:58:45.175
<i>but he might tell his daughter
everything she wants to know.</i>


1231
00:58:45.216 --> 00:58:47.677
Oh, I forgot my camera
back at the house.


1232
00:58:47.719 --> 00:58:49.804
Can I call you back?

1233
00:58:49.846 --> 00:58:53.516
- Sure. Love you.
- I love you too.


1234
00:58:53.558 --> 00:58:57.353
Everett, wait, wait!

1235
00:58:57.395 --> 00:58:59.606
Everett, just talk to me!

1236
00:58:59.647 --> 00:59:02.150
Talk to me.

1237
00:59:02.192 --> 00:59:05.320
Jennifer, I know that your heart
is in the right place,


1238
00:59:05.361 --> 00:59:09.741
but having Campbell here digging
into my past, it's too much.


1239
00:59:09.782 --> 00:59:11.701
Okay, yes.
I'm sorry, I really am.


1240
00:59:11.743 --> 00:59:15.038
But maybe it's a good thing?
It could be cathartic.


1241
00:59:15.079 --> 00:59:17.540
Look, I'm only trying
to do what's best for you.


1242
00:59:17.582 --> 00:59:18.875
I know.

1243
00:59:18.917 --> 00:59:22.003
I know, and...
I love you for it.


1244
00:59:25.673 --> 00:59:28.551
I ever tell you about
the last time I saw her?


1245
00:59:28.593 --> 00:59:30.637
No.

1246
00:59:30.678 --> 00:59:32.555
After I was away
for a few years,


1247
00:59:32.597 --> 00:59:34.224
I started to think,

1248
00:59:34.265 --> 00:59:37.227
I'm on my way to being
a better man, better father,


1249
00:59:37.268 --> 00:59:39.896
so I thought,
well, I should look her up.


1250
00:59:39.938 --> 00:59:43.608
So I researched Alice's school,
and it turns out


1251
00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:46.611
they're having
a Christmas pageant.


1252
00:59:46.653 --> 00:59:50.990
I thought, well,
that's the perfect time.


1253
00:59:51.032 --> 00:59:53.076
So I drove back to Texas
all night


1254
00:59:53.117 --> 00:59:55.370
and I stood in the back
of the auditorium and...


1255
00:59:55.411 --> 00:59:58.248
I watched the whole thing.

1256
00:59:58.289 --> 01:00:00.208
And...

1257
01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:05.004
she was just the cutest thing
you've ever seen.


1258
01:00:05.046 --> 01:00:06.926
So after the show,
I thought I'd go talk to her,


1259
01:00:06.965 --> 01:00:09.509
but her... her mom
and this other man


1260
01:00:09.551 --> 01:00:12.303
get their first,

1261
01:00:12.345 --> 01:00:15.014
and he gives her roses

1262
01:00:15.056 --> 01:00:16.933
and she jumps into his arms.

1263
01:00:18.434 --> 01:00:20.311
They were so happy, Jennifer.

1264
01:00:22.438 --> 01:00:24.941
It was...

1265
01:00:26.025 --> 01:00:28.862
it was the perfect family.

1266
01:00:28.903 --> 01:00:31.114
Then what happened?

1267
01:00:31.156 --> 01:00:33.074
I left.

1268
01:00:34.993 --> 01:00:36.578
But I never stopped loving her.

1269
01:00:38.746 --> 01:00:42.041
Even if I have to love her
from a distance...


1270
01:00:45.086 --> 01:00:47.547
she'll always be right here.

1271
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:51.467

01:01:40.225 --> 01:01:42.644
Hi, merry Christmas Eve.
What can I get you?


1277
01:01:54.197 --> 01:01:55.865
How are my two
favorite tastemakers?


1278
01:01:55.907 --> 01:01:57.450
Hungry.

1279
01:01:57.492 --> 01:01:59.536
You're awfully quiet.
What's up?


1280
01:01:59.577 --> 01:02:01.329
Just...

1281
01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:04.624
when tonight is over,
you've got to go home, right?


1282
01:02:04.666 --> 01:02:07.293
Well, she has work, Amelia. She
can't just stay here forever.


1283
01:02:07.335 --> 01:02:09.045
Well, I know that, but...

1284
01:02:09.087 --> 01:02:11.881
Well, that doesn't mean
I'm leaving, not really.


1285
01:02:11.923 --> 01:02:14.384
I mean, we still
have Christmas breakfast,


1286
01:02:14.425 --> 01:02:17.136
and then we can
video-chat and text,


1287
01:02:17.178 --> 01:02:19.347
and I'm only
an hour away by plane.


1288
01:02:19.389 --> 01:02:22.016
So... I can come back
and visit.


1289
01:02:22.058 --> 01:02:23.351
- You promise?
- Yeah.


1290
01:02:23.393 --> 01:02:25.478
- You'll come back?
- I promise.


1291
01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.188
In the meantime,

1292
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:29.899
I have a very important
mission for you guys.


1293
01:02:29.941 --> 01:02:33.027
I need to go help your mom with
my new skills in the truck,


1294
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:35.572
and I need someone to go around
and take some pictures


1295
01:02:35.613 --> 01:02:37.115
for my article.

1296
01:02:37.157 --> 01:02:38.950
Are you guys up for it?

1297
01:02:38.992 --> 01:02:40.618
- Wait, for real?
- Yeah.


1298
01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.329
- You can count on us.
- Okay, good. Here. Be careful.


1299
01:02:43.371 --> 01:02:45.373
- Yes!
- -Come on, Mary-Margaret.


1300
01:02:45.415 --> 01:02:50.545
Here. And needless to say,
he never went caroling again.


1301
01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.593
Everything all right, there?

1302
01:02:56.634 --> 01:02:59.804
Um, yeah. I'm just, um...

1303
01:02:59.846 --> 01:03:00.930
just thinking.

1304
01:03:00.972 --> 01:03:03.016
Anything I can help with?

1305
01:03:03.057 --> 01:03:05.685
Not unless, uh, you know
how to tell the man


1306
01:03:05.727 --> 01:03:09.314
you're writing a story about
that you're his daughter.


1307
01:03:09.355 --> 01:03:11.316
You're gonna tell him?

1308
01:03:11.357 --> 01:03:13.359
Yeah, it's, uh... it's time.

1309
01:03:16.321 --> 01:03:19.407
I don't know why
you did it, you know,


1310
01:03:19.449 --> 01:03:23.828
uh, finding me, and, uh,
asking me here


1311
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:25.705
and helping me through the week.

1312
01:03:25.747 --> 01:03:26.915
But, um...

1313
01:03:26.956 --> 01:03:29.209
thank you...

1314
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:31.961
from the bottom of my heart.

1315
01:03:32.003 --> 01:03:34.088
Well, you know,
you don't need a reason


1316
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:37.133
to bring more love
into the world.


1317
01:03:37.175 --> 01:03:39.594
Ladies, we're out of meat pies.
Need some more.


1318
01:03:39.636 --> 01:03:42.931
Excuse you, we were having
a moment here.


1319
01:03:42.972 --> 01:03:45.183
You know what?

1320
01:03:45.225 --> 01:03:48.394
Why don't you take it easy,
go walk around the party,


1321
01:03:48.436 --> 01:03:50.063
and I can handle things here?

1322
01:03:50.104 --> 01:03:51.773
Okay.

1323
01:03:51.814 --> 01:03:54.400
Have fun.

1324
01:03:54.442 --> 01:03:55.235
Thank you.

1325
01:03:55.276 --> 01:03:56.736
You're welcome.

1326
01:04:14.045 --> 01:04:16.297
All right, so,
what are you going to tell him?


1327
01:04:16.339 --> 01:04:17.966
You are just as bad as Jennifer.

1328
01:04:18.007 --> 01:04:20.718
- It's a big moment, Campbell.
- I know it's a big moment.


1329
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.405
I'm trying not to freak out, and
the two of you are making it worse.


1330
01:04:23.429 --> 01:04:25.324
Ah, so what you're saying is,
you need a distraction.


1331
01:04:25.348 --> 01:04:26.808
- Yes, please.
- Hmm.


1332
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:28.852
Do you know how to two-step?

1333
01:04:30.395 --> 01:04:32.689
- No?
- No.


1334
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:35.316
- Really good.
- Yeah.


1335
01:04:38.653 --> 01:04:40.488
Oh, wow, you think
you're really smooth, huh?


1336
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:42.758
I promise you I did not know
it was going to be a slow song.


1337
01:04:42.782 --> 01:04:45.201
- I am so sorry.
- So, you don't want to dance?


1338
01:04:45.243 --> 01:04:48.204
- No, I didn't say that.
- I'm messing with you, Jackson.


1339
01:04:50.957 --> 01:04:52.208
Take my hand.

1340
01:04:55.837 --> 01:04:58.423
Never had a Christmas quite
like this one, I must say.


1341
01:04:58.464 --> 01:05:00.216
Yeah?
Where was your last one?


1342
01:05:00.258 --> 01:05:04.596
Uh, I was about a hundred miles
outside of Ulaanbaatar,


1343
01:05:04.637 --> 01:05:06.681
learning how
the Mongolian herders


1344
01:05:06.723 --> 01:05:09.309
keep their animals alive
during the winter.


1345
01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:12.645
- So a very normal one.
- Yes, yes. Mm-hmm.


1346
01:05:12.687 --> 01:05:15.607
Don't worry,
this one is... much better.


1347
01:05:18.818 --> 01:05:23.031
Yeah, way less chance
of frostbite here.


1348
01:05:23.072 --> 01:05:24.491
I'm pretty sure
I read every book


1349
01:05:24.532 --> 01:05:27.076
on the outside world
past the parish lines,


1350
01:05:27.118 --> 01:05:29.078
and I've never been past them.

1351
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.247
I can't believe that. How?

1352
01:05:31.289 --> 01:05:33.041
My family's been here
for generations.


1353
01:05:33.082 --> 01:05:34.709
My parents had me later in life,

1354
01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:36.669
and I'm pretty sure
they don't want me to leave.


1355
01:05:36.711 --> 01:05:40.089
- Hmm.
- Follow in the old family footsteps.


1356
01:05:40.131 --> 01:05:43.551
Become Pere Noel,
work for the city.


1357
01:05:43.593 --> 01:05:46.387
Settle down, essentially do
everything that they did.


1358
01:05:46.429 --> 01:05:50.433
I mean, I know
it's none of my business,


1359
01:05:50.475 --> 01:05:54.103
but I think your family
would want you to be happy


1360
01:05:54.145 --> 01:05:56.856
and leave Sorrento,
if that's what you want,


1361
01:05:56.898 --> 01:05:58.942
you know, see the world
outside of your books.


1362
01:05:58.983 --> 01:06:00.944
Yeah. Maybe.

1363
01:06:02.904 --> 01:06:05.990
So, okay, where would you go
if you could be anywhere?


1364
01:06:06.032 --> 01:06:07.951
That's a very good question.

1365
01:06:07.992 --> 01:06:09.577
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


1366
01:06:09.619 --> 01:06:11.412
Um...

1367
01:06:11.454 --> 01:06:12.997
Where are <i>you</i> going next?

1368
01:06:14.916 --> 01:06:16.709
Um...

1369
01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:19.087
my editor was talking
about me doing a story


1370
01:06:19.128 --> 01:06:21.214
in Morocco.

1371
01:06:21.256 --> 01:06:23.800
- Morocco?
- Mm-hmm.


1372
01:06:23.842 --> 01:06:25.885
That's where I want to go.

1373
01:06:41.568 --> 01:06:43.361
Campbell, come on!

1374
01:06:43.403 --> 01:06:45.905
Oh, it's starting.

1375
01:06:45.947 --> 01:06:47.657
Are you coming?

1376
01:07:07.051 --> 01:07:08.761
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1377
01:07:08.803 --> 01:07:10.638
Merry Christmas!

1378
01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.391
Now, you know I'm not
one for big speeches.


1379
01:07:13.433 --> 01:07:15.977
It occurred to me that Christmas

1380
01:07:16.019 --> 01:07:19.898
happens during the darkest
and coldest time of the year.


1381
01:07:19.939 --> 01:07:22.650
And here in Louisiana,
that's about 50 degrees.


1382
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.321
But with our care
for each other,


1383
01:07:26.362 --> 01:07:28.364
we cast off that chill.

1384
01:07:28.406 --> 01:07:34.412
We illuminate the darkness
with fire and celebration.


1385
01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:38.333
So it's only fitting
that we would ask the family


1386
01:07:38.374 --> 01:07:43.046
of our newest Pere Noel,
Everett Bergeron,


1387
01:07:43.087 --> 01:07:45.465
to join us in the tradition

1388
01:07:45.507 --> 01:07:48.051
of calling out
the Christmas alligators


1389
01:07:48.092 --> 01:07:51.679
to welcome him back to Sorrento
and kick off Christmas.


1390
01:07:51.721 --> 01:07:53.723
Ladies, please.

1391
01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:58.811
Come on.
Come on.


1392
01:07:58.853 --> 01:08:00.522
Yeah. Okay.

1393
01:08:00.563 --> 01:08:02.690
- Wait, what is it again?
- It's like the book.


1394
01:08:02.732 --> 01:08:05.360
- Oh! Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
- You girls ready?


1395
01:08:05.401 --> 01:08:07.278
- Yes.
- All right, here we go.


1396
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.905
Ha, Gaston!

1397
01:08:08.947 --> 01:08:10.323
Ha, Tiboy!

1398
01:08:10.365 --> 01:08:12.116
Ha, Pierre an' Alcee'!

1399
01:08:12.158 --> 01:08:13.493
Gee, Ninette!

1400
01:08:13.535 --> 01:08:15.453
Gee, Suzette!

1401
01:08:15.495 --> 01:08:17.705
Celeste an' Renee!

1402
01:08:17.747 --> 01:08:20.208
<i>Allons-y!</i>

1403
01:08:43.398 --> 01:08:44.941
There it is!

1404
01:08:50.321 --> 01:08:52.157
Merry Christmas, y'all!

1405
01:08:52.198 --> 01:08:54.367
Merry Christmas!

1406
01:08:57.203 --> 01:08:58.955
Happy holidays!

1407
01:08:58.997 --> 01:09:01.833
Yohhhh!

1408
01:09:07.964 --> 01:09:09.966
Ho ho ho!

1409
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:16.181
Merry Christmas, y'all!

1410
01:09:16.222 --> 01:09:18.850
Merry Christmas!

1411
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:23.688
Hey-hey! Hey there, my girls!

1412
01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:25.023
Merry Christmas.

1413
01:09:25.064 --> 01:09:27.734
Some candy canes
for my favorite girls.


1414
01:09:27.775 --> 01:09:30.403
That's right, let's get
this Christmas party started!


1415
01:09:36.284 --> 01:09:39.204
This time of night
it's customary for Pere Noel


1416
01:09:39.245 --> 01:09:41.206
to make a little toast.

1417
01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:44.375
I'm sure Mayor Thomas has
already given a fine speech.


1418
01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:46.085
Exactly.

1419
01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:52.675
But since it's tradition, I feel
obliged to carry the torch, so to speak.


1420
01:09:52.717 --> 01:09:55.595
Now, this year you've
chosen me to be Pere Noel,


1421
01:09:55.637 --> 01:09:57.222
"the ultimate father figure,"

1422
01:09:57.263 --> 01:09:59.891
as a friend of mine once said.

1423
01:09:59.933 --> 01:10:01.613
Because at Christmas,
you know, as parents,


1424
01:10:01.643 --> 01:10:03.895
we're busier
than ever, aren't we?


1425
01:10:03.937 --> 01:10:06.564
You know, it's a time of year
when our love for them


1426
01:10:06.606 --> 01:10:08.441
really shines.

1427
01:10:08.483 --> 01:10:10.777
It's a time when we remember

1428
01:10:10.819 --> 01:10:13.404
just how special that bond is.

1429
01:10:16.241 --> 01:10:20.662
I haven't always been
a perfect man or perfect father,


1430
01:10:20.703 --> 01:10:23.456
but having kids has been
the greatest honor of my life,


1431
01:10:23.498 --> 01:10:27.961
and if I ever accomplish anything on
this Earth, it will have been that,


1432
01:10:28.002 --> 01:10:32.715
so I would like to raise
a toast to my family, my girls,


1433
01:10:32.757 --> 01:10:35.176
my everything...

1434
01:10:35.218 --> 01:10:38.972
and to you and yours,
wherever they may be.


1435
01:10:39.013 --> 01:10:40.306
Cheers!

1436
01:10:40.348 --> 01:10:42.767
Cheers!

1437
01:10:45.395 --> 01:10:47.063
Whoo, whoo!

1438
01:10:47.105 --> 01:10:48.898
Cheers, you guys.

1439
01:10:53.862 --> 01:10:55.572
- Dad!
- Hey, how are y'all?


1440
01:10:55.613 --> 01:10:57.657
- How are ya?
- You did great, Dad.


1441
01:10:57.699 --> 01:10:59.784
Merry Chr... Thank you.
I practiced in the garage.


1442
01:10:59.826 --> 01:11:01.494
I didn't want to tell anybody.

1443
01:11:01.536 --> 01:11:04.414
You can't have any of that.

1444
01:11:04.455 --> 01:11:06.124
Okay.

1445
01:11:06.166 --> 01:11:07.834
Okay, uh...

1446
01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.461
Dad. No.

1447
01:11:10.503 --> 01:11:11.880
That's so strong.

1448
01:11:11.921 --> 01:11:12.839
Uh...

1449
01:11:12.881 --> 01:11:15.675
Okay, okay, Everett.

1450
01:11:15.717 --> 01:11:18.136
I wanted to say
something to you and...


1451
01:11:18.178 --> 01:11:20.597
Hey. What are you doing
all the way out here?


1452
01:11:20.638 --> 01:11:23.516
Eh, nothing.

1453
01:11:23.558 --> 01:11:25.185
Are you rehearsing?

1454
01:11:25.226 --> 01:11:27.562
No.

1455
01:11:27.604 --> 01:11:29.230
Maybe.

1456
01:11:29.272 --> 01:11:30.565
Okay, fine.

1457
01:11:30.607 --> 01:11:33.693
You and Jennifer got in my head.

1458
01:11:33.735 --> 01:11:38.031
And... that speech
from Everett...


1459
01:11:38.072 --> 01:11:41.034
This is just such
an important night, and...


1460
01:11:41.075 --> 01:11:44.430
it's my last chance to tell him before I leave
tomorrow, and I don't want to mess it up.


1461
01:11:44.454 --> 01:11:46.539
So speak from the heart.

1462
01:11:46.581 --> 01:11:49.417
Listen, I was wrong, okay?

1463
01:11:49.459 --> 01:11:51.377
Don't think so much.

1464
01:11:51.419 --> 01:11:53.546
<i>Now</i> you tell me.

1465
01:11:53.588 --> 01:11:55.715
Campbell...

1466
01:11:55.757 --> 01:11:57.759
who wouldn't love you?

1467
01:12:01.804 --> 01:12:04.182
I just...

1468
01:12:04.224 --> 01:12:06.684
Once I tell him,
everything's going to change...


1469
01:12:06.726 --> 01:12:08.603
For the better.

1470
01:12:08.645 --> 01:12:10.688
Yeah, I hope so.

1471
01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:13.900
Jackson, you were
supposed to bring her back.


1472
01:12:13.942 --> 01:12:16.778
I am now the rescue party
for the rescue party.


1473
01:12:18.321 --> 01:12:19.572
So, Campbell,

1474
01:12:19.614 --> 01:12:21.157
there's sort of
a lull over there.


1475
01:12:21.199 --> 01:12:23.284
I think now
might be a good time.


1476
01:12:27.497 --> 01:12:30.124
Yeah. Okay.

1477
01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:31.376
Yes.

1478
01:12:31.417 --> 01:12:33.044
Yeah.

1479
01:12:33.086 --> 01:12:34.295
I'm ready.

1480
01:12:35.797 --> 01:12:37.423
- Cool.
- You got this.


1481
01:12:37.465 --> 01:12:38.800
Yep.

1482
01:12:42.804 --> 01:12:44.973
Why am I so nervous?

1483
01:12:45.014 --> 01:12:46.933
Because you love her too.

1484
01:12:48.643 --> 01:12:49.936
Aw.

1485
01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.317
- Ooh, hey there.
- Hi.


1486
01:12:56.359 --> 01:12:58.528
All right, so...

1487
01:12:58.570 --> 01:13:00.029
what do you think of Sorrento?

1488
01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:03.950
Uh, compared to...
London, Paris?


1489
01:13:03.992 --> 01:13:06.578
Yeah, it's a special place,
that's for sure.


1490
01:13:06.619 --> 01:13:08.288
I'm sad I have
to leave tomorrow.


1491
01:13:08.329 --> 01:13:10.039
We feel the same way.

1492
01:13:10.081 --> 01:13:11.749
Got enough for your article?

1493
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:15.295
Uh, actually,
I was hoping to talk to you,


1494
01:13:15.336 --> 01:13:18.965
you know, kid to Pere Noel.

1495
01:13:19.007 --> 01:13:22.343
Uh... yeah, of course.

1496
01:13:22.385 --> 01:13:24.470
- What's up?
- Um...


1497
01:13:24.512 --> 01:13:28.474
So, Everett, uh...

1498
01:13:28.516 --> 01:13:30.852
tonight in your speech,

1499
01:13:30.894 --> 01:13:35.023
you said that being a father was
the greatest honor of your life.


1500
01:13:35.064 --> 01:13:38.193
- Yeah.
- Yeah. And, um...


1501
01:13:38.234 --> 01:13:40.528
Dad, Campbell! We ran
into some fellow reporters


1502
01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:42.280
all the way from Mississippi!

1503
01:13:42.322 --> 01:13:44.574
- Oh!
- Pere Noel, if we could just get a few photos


1504
01:13:44.616 --> 01:13:46.659
of you and your family.

1505
01:13:46.701 --> 01:13:48.661
- Do you mind?
- Um...


1506
01:13:48.703 --> 01:13:50.497
Then we'll finish
our chat later?


1507
01:13:50.538 --> 01:13:52.165
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Okay.


1508
01:13:52.207 --> 01:13:55.043
- Girls, what is all this?
- Oh, regional exposure, Mom.


1509
01:13:55.084 --> 01:13:56.878
Come on, get in the picture.

1510
01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.898
Yeah, actually, if you can stand
right next to Pere Noel.


1511
01:13:58.922 --> 01:14:00.089
Oh, yeah.

1512
01:14:02.592 --> 01:14:04.719
- Campbell.
- Oh, no, this is great.


1513
01:14:04.761 --> 01:14:06.262
Just the family's all we need.

1514
01:14:06.304 --> 01:14:08.139
All right.

1515
01:14:08.181 --> 01:14:10.058
Everybody look here.

1516
01:14:10.099 --> 01:14:13.186
All right, get together
and say, "Hot chocolate!"


1517
01:14:13.228 --> 01:14:15.230
Hot chocolate!

1518
01:14:15.271 --> 01:14:18.233
Yeah, the mayor did a good job.

1519
01:14:21.778 --> 01:14:23.613
So sorry, I'll be right back.

1520
01:14:29.077 --> 01:14:31.412
Hey, slow down!
Where are you going?


1521
01:14:31.454 --> 01:14:34.707
- I need to go home.
- Okay, well then, give me a minute, I'll go with you.


1522
01:14:34.749 --> 01:14:36.584
No, I'm...

1523
01:14:36.626 --> 01:14:38.878
I'm going home.

1524
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.129
I'm sorry.

1525
01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:42.298
This was a huge mistake.

1526
01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.343
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What happened?


1527
01:14:45.385 --> 01:14:47.554
- What did he say?
- I didn't tell him, okay?


1528
01:14:47.595 --> 01:14:51.391
- Oh, Campbell.
- And I ask that you please don't either.


1529
01:14:51.432 --> 01:14:54.269
I just... I don't know
what I was thinking.


1530
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:57.438
I have a family back in Dallas,
a great family, actually,


1531
01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.441
and, you know, maybe Everett not
coming back and not changing things


1532
01:15:00.483 --> 01:15:02.235
was for the best.

1533
01:15:02.277 --> 01:15:05.321
He left things alone, and maybe
I need to do the same thing.


1534
01:15:05.363 --> 01:15:07.240
Campbell.

1535
01:15:07.282 --> 01:15:10.201
Campbell!
Will you please just wait?


1536
01:15:10.243 --> 01:15:12.245
You need to let me go, Jackson.

1537
01:15:12.287 --> 01:15:14.789
This is your family,
your choice,


1538
01:15:14.831 --> 01:15:16.541
but you're leaving behind
such a gift.


1539
01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:18.168
It's so much more complicated
than that.


1540
01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:20.587
Of course it's complicated,
it's family.


1541
01:15:20.628 --> 01:15:21.921
I get it.

1542
01:15:21.963 --> 01:15:24.424
But they obviously
care about you.


1543
01:15:24.465 --> 01:15:26.176
Maybe if you just
told them the truth.


1544
01:15:26.217 --> 01:15:28.761
Maybe not all family
is meant to be.


1545
01:15:28.803 --> 01:15:30.430
Yes.

1546
01:15:30.471 --> 01:15:32.807
But can you honestly spend
the rest of your life


1547
01:15:32.849 --> 01:15:34.350
knowing what you left
behind here?


1548
01:15:46.404 --> 01:15:48.406
Campbell, hi, it's me again.

1549
01:15:48.448 --> 01:15:50.408
Uh, merry Christmas.

1550
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:51.993
We, uh, missed you last night,

1551
01:15:52.035 --> 01:15:54.204
and I was just calling to see
if you're all right


1552
01:15:54.245 --> 01:15:57.832
and to let you know that the offer
for Christmas breakfast still stands.


1553
01:15:57.874 --> 01:16:00.084
Um, give us a call.

1554
01:16:00.126 --> 01:16:01.336
Bye.

1555
01:16:01.377 --> 01:16:03.296
She'll call.

1556
01:16:03.338 --> 01:16:05.590
I don't know,
maybe she finished her story.


1557
01:16:05.632 --> 01:16:08.510
I just feel bad for the girls. I mean,
they really took a liking to her.


1558
01:16:08.551 --> 01:16:13.389
I did too. I mean, do you really think
she would leave without saying goodbye?


1559
01:16:13.431 --> 01:16:15.141
Hey, it's Jackson.

1560
01:16:15.183 --> 01:16:17.602
- In the kitchen.
- Is it her?


1561
01:16:17.644 --> 01:16:19.062
Is she here?!

1562
01:16:19.103 --> 01:16:21.940
Merry Christmas,
Bergeron family.


1563
01:16:21.981 --> 01:16:24.067
- Oh, it's just you.
- Be nice.


1564
01:16:24.108 --> 01:16:27.862
It's okay, I get it. Campbell was a
very special person, I'd be sad too.


1565
01:16:27.904 --> 01:16:31.115
Luckily for you, though,
you don't have to be.


1566
01:16:31.157 --> 01:16:34.285
- Oh! Hey!
- Merry Christmas!


1567
01:16:34.327 --> 01:16:36.955
Merry Christmas!

1568
01:16:36.996 --> 01:16:38.873
Hello!

1569
01:16:38.915 --> 01:16:41.125
- Hello.
- See?


1570
01:16:41.167 --> 01:16:43.354
I told everyone you wouldn't
leave without saying goodbye.


1571
01:16:43.378 --> 01:16:45.380
- Never!
- We were worried you ran off.


1572
01:16:45.421 --> 01:16:48.341
And miss all this? No way.

1573
01:16:48.383 --> 01:16:50.468
I just couldn't come
to Christmas morning


1574
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:53.972
without getting
some presents, and, uh...


1575
01:16:54.013 --> 01:16:56.349
my story is far from over.

1576
01:16:59.143 --> 01:17:02.230
Oh, and if anyone's wondering
if the big-box store out on I-10


1577
01:17:02.272 --> 01:17:06.151
is open at 2 a.m.
on Christmas Eve... it is.


1578
01:17:06.192 --> 01:17:08.069
Come on, now. Let's eat.

1579
01:17:08.111 --> 01:17:09.612
Give me those!

1580
01:17:09.654 --> 01:17:11.739
- Oh!
- Merry Christmas.


1581
01:17:11.781 --> 01:17:12.907
Thank you.

1582
01:17:14.534 --> 01:17:16.327
All right, girls,
put those under the tree,


1583
01:17:16.369 --> 01:17:18.204
and, uh, yeah, Jackson,
grab a seat.


1584
01:17:18.246 --> 01:17:19.956
Campbell, grab a seat.

1585
01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:25.336
- Juice!
- -All right, grab one and pass it down.


1586
01:17:25.378 --> 01:17:27.338
- Thank you.
- Gravy's on the side.


1587
01:17:33.636 --> 01:17:35.972
They're beautiful!
Thank you.


1588
01:17:36.014 --> 01:17:39.350
- You're welcome.
- Okay, so, last but not least...


1589
01:17:39.392 --> 01:17:43.062
Okay.
Uh... Mary-Margaret.


1590
01:17:43.104 --> 01:17:44.856
Oh, for me?

1591
01:17:44.898 --> 01:17:45.898
Yes.

1592
01:17:47.817 --> 01:17:50.737
For your budding
influencer career.


1593
01:17:52.363 --> 01:17:54.991
Seriously? Oh, my goodness.

1594
01:17:55.033 --> 01:17:57.535
I love it. Thank you!

1595
01:17:57.577 --> 01:17:59.370
Oh!

1596
01:17:59.412 --> 01:18:01.789
I thought you might.

1597
01:18:01.831 --> 01:18:02.874
Thank you so much.

1598
01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:04.626
Amelia.

1599
01:18:10.715 --> 01:18:12.509
A place to put your thoughts.

1600
01:18:13.968 --> 01:18:15.345
I have a lot of thoughts.

1601
01:18:17.388 --> 01:18:20.642
Uh, okay, and, Jennifer.

1602
01:18:20.683 --> 01:18:22.519
- One for you.
- Oh, wow, me too?


1603
01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.812
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.


1604
01:18:30.151 --> 01:18:32.070
It's our saying!

1605
01:18:32.111 --> 01:18:34.614
Yeah, well,
he shared your story with me,


1606
01:18:34.656 --> 01:18:37.116
and I was... inspired.

1607
01:18:37.158 --> 01:18:39.911
Oh, thank you so much.

1608
01:18:39.953 --> 01:18:41.412
Look at that.

1609
01:18:41.454 --> 01:18:43.122
You're good at this.

1610
01:18:43.164 --> 01:18:45.250
That is so sweet!

1611
01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:46.626
And, um...

1612
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:51.172
Uh... Everett, yours is

1613
01:18:51.214 --> 01:18:53.174
the only one I didn't buy.

1614
01:19:12.318 --> 01:19:13.319
You can't be.

1615
01:19:13.361 --> 01:19:15.405
She...

1616
01:19:15.446 --> 01:19:17.782
my baby girl had darker hair

1617
01:19:17.824 --> 01:19:20.118
and a little crooked tooth.

1618
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.870
Yeah, right in the front.

1619
01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:27.876
Alice?

1620
01:19:32.338 --> 01:19:34.132
I should have told you
the truth sooner,


1621
01:19:34.174 --> 01:19:36.176
but I needed...

1622
01:19:36.217 --> 01:19:38.303
I thought...

1623
01:19:38.344 --> 01:19:39.888
Everett.

1624
01:19:44.142 --> 01:19:46.102
Campbell, I'm so sorry.

1625
01:19:46.144 --> 01:19:48.104
Mama, what... what was it?

1626
01:19:50.148 --> 01:19:52.775
- Is she crying?
- It's okay.


1627
01:19:52.817 --> 01:19:54.944
No, it's fine.
I'm fine. I just, um...


1628
01:19:54.986 --> 01:19:56.905
- Campbell.
- We should get going anyway.


1629
01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:02.243
I... I have loved
every minute of my time here,


1630
01:20:02.285 --> 01:20:03.953
and all of you are, uh...

1631
01:20:03.995 --> 01:20:05.788
Wait, hang on.

1632
01:20:10.418 --> 01:20:12.962
Don't go.

1633
01:20:13.004 --> 01:20:14.756
What's this?

1634
01:20:14.797 --> 01:20:17.217
It's a gift, for you.

1635
01:20:20.637 --> 01:20:23.973
When I left,
I thought I was protecting you.


1636
01:20:24.015 --> 01:20:25.642
I thought it was
the right thing to do,


1637
01:20:25.683 --> 01:20:27.519
and I wanted you to know it

1638
01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.354
and to know how much
I missed you.


1639
01:20:29.395 --> 01:20:31.898
And so I sent some letters.

1640
01:20:33.441 --> 01:20:35.318
But we moved
and we changed our name.


1641
01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.569
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1642
01:20:36.611 --> 01:20:38.321
And, uh,
when the letters came back,


1643
01:20:38.363 --> 01:20:40.156
I...

1644
01:20:40.198 --> 01:20:43.368
bought a notebook,
and I wrote in that instead,


1645
01:20:43.409 --> 01:20:47.038
everything that I was thinking,
everything that I was feeling,


1646
01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:52.085
all the regret and sorrow
and apologies and...


1647
01:20:52.126 --> 01:20:53.920
I wrote every day.

1648
01:20:53.962 --> 01:20:57.006
It's a lifetime
of days spent missing you


1649
01:20:57.048 --> 01:20:58.299
and loving you.

1650
01:21:12.313 --> 01:21:14.232
I thought you didn't want me.

1651
01:21:14.274 --> 01:21:17.193
No. Never.

1652
01:21:17.235 --> 01:21:19.279
I am so sorry.

1653
01:21:21.781 --> 01:21:26.244
I just... I can't believe
that you're really here.


1654
01:21:26.286 --> 01:21:28.246
I can't believe it, either.

1655
01:21:29.789 --> 01:21:32.208
Jennifer, you were
in on this, weren't you?


1656
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:36.004
Yes.
But I had help from Jackson.


1657
01:21:36.045 --> 01:21:38.673
What can I say, I love to keep
the town family records complete.


1658
01:21:38.715 --> 01:21:40.925
Uh-huh.

1659
01:21:40.967 --> 01:21:44.304
Um, could somebody please
explain what's going on?


1660
01:21:44.345 --> 01:21:45.930
Yeah, why is everyone crying?

1661
01:21:45.972 --> 01:21:48.016
Well, uh, girls,

1662
01:21:48.057 --> 01:21:52.020
uh, years ago,
I had another daughter,


1663
01:21:52.061 --> 01:21:53.980
your older sister.

1664
01:21:55.481 --> 01:21:58.776
And Campbell...

1665
01:21:58.818 --> 01:22:01.446
- Wait, she's our sister?
- I knew it!


1666
01:22:01.488 --> 01:22:03.698
- You did not!
- I had a hunch.


1667
01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:06.075
Oh, a hunch!

1668
01:22:06.117 --> 01:22:08.203
Okay, so I'm not the oldest?

1669
01:22:08.244 --> 01:22:10.121
I guess not.

1670
01:22:10.163 --> 01:22:12.916
Wait, so if you're our sister,
then that means...


1671
01:22:17.462 --> 01:22:18.922
That's a great idea.

1672
01:22:21.674 --> 01:22:24.761
The secret ingredient.

1673
01:22:24.802 --> 01:22:27.180
We only share it with family.

1674
01:22:27.222 --> 01:22:30.058
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.


1675
01:22:31.893 --> 01:22:33.895
Oh, I gotta get a piece of this.

1676
01:22:33.937 --> 01:22:37.148
Come on, now.

1677
01:22:37.190 --> 01:22:38.733
Oh, Jackson, come in.

1678
01:22:38.775 --> 01:22:41.361
Come in.

1679
01:22:41.402 --> 01:22:44.656
- Come on in! Come on!
- All right.


1680
01:22:44.697 --> 01:22:46.449
All right, merry Christmas on 3.

1681
01:22:46.491 --> 01:22:48.159
1, 2, 3!

1682
01:22:48.201 --> 01:22:50.203
Merry Christmas!

1683
01:22:50.245 --> 01:22:52.956
Yeah, that's a good one.

1684
01:22:52.997 --> 01:22:57.126
<i>Ever since that fateful Christmas,
I get asked a lot of things.</i>


1685
01:22:57.168 --> 01:23:00.046
<i>"What did it feel like
to meet your father?"</i>


1686
01:23:00.088 --> 01:23:04.133
<i>"Are your sisters
really that cool?"</i>


1687
01:23:04.175 --> 01:23:06.594
<i>"What made you go back
on Christmas morning?"</i>


1688
01:23:06.636 --> 01:23:09.222
<i>And "Is Jackson
as cute as he sounds?"</i>


1689
01:23:11.015 --> 01:23:12.767
<i>And all those
are fair questions,</i>


1690
01:23:12.809 --> 01:23:16.855
<i>but the question I get asked
the most often is,</i>


1691
01:23:16.896 --> 01:23:19.357
<i>"What happened next?"</i>

1692
01:23:19.399 --> 01:23:21.442
<i>What happened after my first</i>

1693
01:23:21.484 --> 01:23:24.654
<i>Louisiana family Christmas?</i>

1694
01:23:24.696 --> 01:23:26.656
<i>Well, that's easy.</i>

1695
01:23:26.698 --> 01:23:28.199
<i>Everything.</i>

1696
01:23:28.241 --> 01:23:29.534
<i>♪ ...and spend it</i>

1697
01:23:29.576 --> 01:23:33.121
<i>♪ Here with me</i>

01:23:34.747 --> 01:23:39.752
