1
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.431
Two times.

2
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.636
Yes.

3
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.638
Try it crouching down.

4
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.715
And one handed.

5
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.875
Yes, one handed. Come on.
- Yes!


6
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.196
Yes, not bad.

7
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.555
Shit.

8
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.149
Shit.

9
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.559
That impossible. That can't be.
- Calm down. We will find it.


10
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.918
Found it.

11
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.195
Do you have it?

12
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.399
Let's count again.

13
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.120
Yes.

14
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.600
Okay?

15
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.399
Take this one.

16
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.751
Deeper. Further in! 
Are you crazy!

17
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.033
What about him?
- No.


18
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.675
That guy?
- Him?


19
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.075
Yeah.

20
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.436
No.

21
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.392
What?
- He saw my face!


22
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.560
Oh, God!

23
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.193
It's not like...
- He saw me.


24
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.119
... he's going to remember.

25
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.073
Or that guy?

26
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.674
Doesn't matter who I suggest,
you're just scared.


27
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.273
What about him?

28
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.833
Or him?

29
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.800
Too many people, 
I can't just...

30
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.277
What do you want, asshole?

31
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.709
Him?

32
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.678
This one.

33
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.076
What about him?
- I am not shooting around here.


34
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.031
What about him?

35
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.437
He is German. Drive on!

36
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.358
What is German about him!

37
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.914
Good morning.

38
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.991
What are you watching?

39
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.315
Come on!

40
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.120
Come on now.

41
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.270
Ow.

42
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.354
Stop!

43
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.750
Harder.

44
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.400
What?
- Harder.


45
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.120
Harder.

46
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.039
Wait.
- Come on.


47
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.235
If even that is not working anymore.

48
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.351
I am hungry.
- Then eat something.


49
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.078
There is nothing there.

50
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.157
There is always something.

51
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.152
How much?
- 16.02 euros.


52
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.834
For you.

53
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.553
You spent money on that?

54
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.439
Didn't cost anything.

55
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.240
I stole it.

56
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.473
Are you crazy?

57
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.638
We can't have you
getting arrested for something like this.


58
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.356
Nothing wrong with a bit of fun.

59
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.631
This whole thing is no fun for me.

60
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.475
Shit!

61
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.753
Be more careful!

62
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.359
What's the problem? I try.

63
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.994
Damn it.

64
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.471
There were those two at the supermarket.
- What?


65
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.759
What about them?

66
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.320
They were there kissing in the aisle.

67
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.311
Don't start with that crap again.

68
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.074
You think it's because he gives her
cheap chocolates?


69
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.557
I don't think they need that.

70
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.758
They're enough for each other.
They're content.


71
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.910
Not like us. We're...

72
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.275
Hey!

73
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.639
Something has to happen.

74
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.112
Something has to change, Tommi.
I don't care what.


75
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.631
Something, good or bad,
I don't fucking care.


76
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.794
Something that makes a big bang,
something...


77
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.675
Come here.

78
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.236
Hey.

79
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.954
What?

80
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.194
You not well?

81
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.520
Why?

82
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.199
And now what?

83
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.596
You have a problem with that?
- No.


84
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.194
I mean...

85
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.757
When I see you like this
I think you're not feeling well.


86
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.119
Or what should I think?
- My God, than you re thinking to much.


87
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.754
Hey, come on.

88
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.033
What is it?

89
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.154
Go away!

90
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.197
Just go, will you!

91
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.710
What do you want?
- Put the cup down.


92
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.154
Oh, I hate all of this... My hand!

93
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.517
I just want to know what's up.

94
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.150
Hey...

95
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.113
Ow!
- Shit!


96
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.879
Are you all right?

97
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.873
Get away from me!

98
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.310
Everything OK?
- Go away!


99
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.160
Go away!

100
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.200
Get lost!

101
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.832
Go away!

102
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.033
Everything OK?

103
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.273
Don't you have school?

104
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.554
No.

105
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.280
Hi.

106
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.952
2.70 euros, please.

107
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.192
I think I'll go instead.

108
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.837
Hey, I'm not that bad.

109
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.156
Here.

110
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.713
You wanna go back into the park?

111
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.434
Yes.
- OK.


112
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.032
But... I had to learn that too.

113
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.672
I wanted to study,
but than I got scared.

114
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.278
But if you learn that,
then you will be on the right path.


115
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.196
I think you are one that one can go
through thick and thin with.


116
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.432
I really like you.

117
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.479
Come on, have another sip.

118
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.478
Hey!

119
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.596
Now...

120
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.480
You crazy?

121
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.190
Don't you get it?

122
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.910
Don't you get it?

123
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.157
I'm not one of the bad guys!

124
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.757
I'm not one of the bad guys!

125
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.515
OK, catch me.
You have to catch me!


126
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.720
Quick, other way!
Oh my God, oh my God!


127
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.873
Very nice.

128
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.120
Hi.

129
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.075
Hi.
- Hello.


130
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.597
Didn't you have a hoody?

131
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.356
No.

132
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.999
Where is it then?

133
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.879
Isn't it hanging here?

134
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.150
No.

135
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.000
Are you kidding?
You lose your hoody in broad daylight?


136
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.112
Are you an idiot?
- No idea.


137
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.273
Something happen?

138
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.030
No.

139
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.750
Hey, I asked you if something happened.
- No, nothing happened.


140
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.193
Don't fuck with me.
I see that something happened.


141
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.795
Tell me.

142
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.516
If you fuck up,
you know you'll drag me into it too.


143
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.120
Yes.
- Hey!


144
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.239
Look at me!

145
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.232
Are you fucking with me?

146
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.352
You fuck up, then lie to me?

147
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.394
What do you want to hear from me?
- Keep it down!


148
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.273
So I lost my hoody.

149
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.240
Happy now?

150
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.111
No, I'll be happy when you admit
you're a complete idiot!


151
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.517
How can you lose your hoody?
Are you a moron, or what?


152
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.158
I can't..., I can't...

153
00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.760
I can't do this anymore.
- Can't do what?


154
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.558
Can't do what anymore?

155
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.274
Look at me.

156
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.113
This is just nuts!

157
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.871
I do weird stuff all the time.

158
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.432
You've got to be kidding.
- I don't trust myself anymore.


159
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.393
I don't believe this.

160
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.233
You don't get to just decide that.
We're in this together.


161
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.795
You have to understand!
- You don't decide!


162
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.992
This is crazy!
- You don't decide alone, got it?


163
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.435
We're in this together!

164
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.917
This is about both of us,
you can't make that decision alone!


165
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.759
You're not allowed
to make that decision alone!


166
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.920
Hey, how is everybody?

167
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.630
Yes, they were so nice. As always.

168
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.360
You two.
- Do you smoke in here?


169
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.070
Well, it's damn cold out on the balcony.

170
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.155
I don't want that.
They're my kids, OK?


171
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.199
I don't want them exposed to that.
- Could you go to Tommi?


172
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.470
Hey.

173
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.395
Are you making rules for me,
or what is this?


174
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.640
I just think it's antisocial.
- What? You've got to be kidding me.


175
00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.151
If I didn't see to them
they'd be with youth services.


176
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.794
You cunt!

177
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.269
I don't need your help.
That was the last time you see my kids!


178
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.950
Now you listen, here, honey...

179
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.317
I'll smoke when I want to smoke.

180
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.800
OK? I don't give a fuck what you think.
They like it here with me, always.


181
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.997
Now apologize.

182
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.076
Sorry. Ow!
- Please?


183
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.000
Sorry!

184
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.794
Kids!

185
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.753
We're going.

186
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.597
Asocial scum!

187
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.599
You bitch!

188
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.591
We're not just giving up, OK?

189
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.836
Yes.

190
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.671
Tell me what really turns you on.

191
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.151
You.

192
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.953
You turn me on.

193
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.278
Just tell me.

194
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.360
Your ass.

195
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.389
Your tits.
- No, man.


196
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.437
When I take you from behind...

197
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.951
... and you dig your claws into me.

198
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.912
Tell me, like a...

199
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.717
... like a fantasy you have.

200
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.477
Sometimes I think of niggers.

201
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.914
What?

202
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.750
Yes!

203
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.478
Don't laugh.

204
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.912
Don't laugh.

205
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.474
Tell me.

206
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.634
Anything?

207
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.875
Yes.

208
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.595
Sometimes...

209
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.829
... I think about
just sitting next to you,

210
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.953
watching.

211
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.198
When we fuck?
- Yes.


212
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.671
When some other guy...

213
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.117
When some other guy...

214
00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.874
... does you.

215
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.597
He pushes your head to the ground
and you try to scream.


216
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.479
You want to scream,

217
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.592
but your mouth is taped shut.

218
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.792
And you resist,

219
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.559
and the guy...

220
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.590
he smacks you in the face,
and just keeps fucking you!


221
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.152
Got a lighter?
- Yeah.


222
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.279
Put it down over there.

223
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.630
OK.

224
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.155
Oh.

225
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.555
OK.

226
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.239
I know the reason.

227
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.113
It'll work next time.

228
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.793
This isn't going to work. I'm done.
I'm not doing this again.


229
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.833
Would you stop?

230
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.879
I'm always the idiot.

231
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.596
You spend hours on it, and in the end
it doesn't work. It's pointless.


232
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.319
The last one did!
- Right!


233
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.790
It just went off too early.

234
00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.671
It wasn't my fault, I told you.
- No, of course not!


235
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.075
It's never your fault.

236
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.272
It always comes down to luck.

237
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.313
This time we had no luck.
- Always blame the others.


238
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.559
No, I'm to blame, right?

239
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.991
I'm good for nothing.
- Oh, God!


240
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.758
Cut that crap! You and your self-pity.
- I'm done!


241
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.872
I'm sick of this bull.

242
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.078
Fuck off!
- You fuck off!


243
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.519
Sweetie?
- What?


244
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.399
You're hungry?

245
00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.272
Come on now.

246
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.915
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?


247
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.592
What the hell? Hey!

248
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.712
What are you doing?

249
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.553
Have you lost it?
Hey, come on!


250
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.359
That's not allowed, knock it off.
- Not allowed?


251
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.351
No, not allowed.

252
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.472
Ah, between the two of you
nothing is allowed.


253
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.960
We have a few rules here,
and we follow those rules.


254
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.640
Rules, rules!
Am I in the army, or what?


255
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.631
Let Micky settle in first.

256
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.671
There's a reason for why we live here
and how things work.


257
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.679
But you don't get it.
We're in the underground here.


258
00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.920
Oh, cut the underground nonsense.
Nobody cares what you do here.


259
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.998
Oh, really?
- Yeah.


260
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.431
We have to be better organized.
- What are you two on about?


261
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.951
I didn't come here
to discuss the "underground,"


262
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.551
like the Antifa or something.

263
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.197
Micky, it's a new situation for you...
- Micky, Micky, Micky!


264
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.676
Knock off the Micky bullshit!

265
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.320
That's exactly what I meant.
I knew he'd pull this and act the big shot.


266
00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.039
I want to do something,
not just talk about it.


267
00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.636
Now listen...
- No, now you listen!


268
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.439
I don't want to hear it.

269
00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.916
I'm at least as good as you guys.

270
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.230
If not better. 
Twice as good.

271
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.796
OK.

272
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.831
Sure thing.
You really have a big mouth, don't you?


273
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.315
Really big balls.
- I sure do.


274
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.832
I've got really big balls.

275
00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.076
Hey!

276
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.432
God, please!

277
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.552
What? Don't you like it?

278
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.877
Don't you like it, sweetie?
Want to play with it?


279
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.037
Get lost!

280
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.074
Hey!

281
00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.149
Go away!

282
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.876
Ew! Stop! Go away!

283
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.073
Cool, Micky!

284
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.634
Ta-da!

285
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.194
Something...

286
00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.752
Is this canned soup?

287
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.952
Try it. With cuts of meat.

288
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.878
What a stellar chef you are.

289
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.957
You get it in Grande Vignolle in Brussels.
Can you taste the Cayenne pepper?


290
00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.513
Do you taste it? Yes?

291
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.837
Really tastes good.
- Do you?


292
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.633
And the Dijon noodles.

293
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.480
Got those?
Have you tried them? Here.


294
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.713
Dijon.

295
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.633
Nice, huh?

296
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.997
Isn't it pronounced Dijin?
- No,


297
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.475
Di
-Jon.

298
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.354
My grandmother from Mons
made it like this.


299
00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.916
Do you taste it? Do you?

300
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.239
I'm taking a shower.

301
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.034
You coming?

302
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.638
Now?
- Sure.


303
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.839
You could make yourself useful
and do the dishes.


304
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.111
You're the woman of the house.

305
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.872
Depends how you look at it.

306
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.074
Hot!

307
00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.990
You Swine.

308
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.997
You little pig.

309
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.869
Hey, faggot.

310
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.715
Should I fuck you too?

311
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.838
You'd like it, wouldn't you?

312
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.832
For me to fuck you good.

313
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.559
What's going on in here?

314
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.080
Well, nothing.

315
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.674
Ey, what s going on here?

316
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.032
Tommi needs to fuck something too.

317
00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.437
To get him on track.

318
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.751
Then he should look for something.

319
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.959
Ready to go again?

320
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.758
Sure. Come on.

321
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.799
I always am.

322
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.114
Really?

323
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.314
Turns you on a bit, doesn't it?

324
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.717
Where?
- Up ahead.


325
00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.392
Over there?
- Yeah.


326
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.109
And the cars?
- Cars?


327
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.279
Why are there cars?
- Calm down. It's fine.


328
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.996
There are cars all over.
You out of your mind!


329
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.112
Stop it.
- It's still open.


330
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.672
Why is there a light on?

331
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.191
No, it's not.

332
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.679
Hurry up!
- Faster!


333
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.356
Give me that.

334
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.914
What?
- Give me that.


335
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.920
That wasn't the plan.
- So? You think I'll sit here without one?


336
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.158
Will you shut up!
- Give it to me now!


337
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.432
Know where the release is?
- Yes!


338
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.478
Come on, let's go!

339
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.950
What's going on?

340
00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.880
What do you want from me? What's up?

341
00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.190
Get up!

342
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.318
Get a grip!

343
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.754
Come on!

344
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.954
Move out!

345
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.918
Up now!
- Micky?


346
00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.640
Dad!

347
00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.240
Dad!

348
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.393
Come on over, come on!

349
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.994
Come on! Lay down!

350
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.229
Please, I have family and children!
- Down on the ground!


351
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.637
Pull the trigger! Kill him!

352
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.631
On the ground, idiot!
- Shoot!


353
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.115
Shut up!

354
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.233
Fuck!
- Shut up!


355
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.669
Always! Always...

356
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.680
Always praying, you fucking Muslims!

357
00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.714
Come on!

358
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.392
You'll get busted!

359
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.079
Shit!

360
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.160
Move it!

361
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.080
Wipe it up!

362
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.517
Go on!

363
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.436
Come on!

364
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.834
Let's go!

365
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.394
Get up!

366
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.070
Go!
- Go!


367
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.234
Get in!

368
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.994
Step on it!

369
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.039
That was cool!

370
00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.154
So cool!

371
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.034
So cool!

372
00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.192
Yeah! Yeah!

373
00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.278
What does it sound like
when Turks play ping-pong?


374
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.315
Ata-türk, Ata-türk, Ata-türk.
- Did you see his fear?


375
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.080
Such cowards, no honor.

376
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.199
Three schnapps.
- Yes.


377
00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.159
And three beers, please.

378
00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.917
Good evening.
- Hey.


379
00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.280
Did you order?
- Three and three.


380
00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.072
We got a good result today.

381
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.990
That was fast.

382
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.515
How do we come together? Radiantly.

383
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.474
How do we part?
Completely plastered. And why?


384
00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.036
Because we're so sexy!

385
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.278
Now wash it down.

386
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.752
Cheers.
- Celebrating something?


387
00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.394
Yeah.
- Cheers.


388
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.990
You can say that again.
- Cheers.


389
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.714
Is it your birthday?
- Look me in the eye!


390
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.838
Or you'll have seven years of...
- You ought to know.


391
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.396
You're not from around here, are you?

392
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:42.949
No, we're...

393
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.237
We're on vacation.
- Vacation?


394
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.431
Vacation here in our area?

395
00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.189
Sure thing.
- I think it's great here.


396
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.275
So what goes on around here?

397
00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.314
What goes on?

398
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.875
I mean, it's quiet around here, right?

399
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.591
You don't have many problems, do you?

400
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.439
No problems.
He said we have no problems.


401
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.351
Great.

402
00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.070
We've got plenty of problems.
No shortage of them.


403
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.434
You can say that again.
- Or not?


404
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.313
Problems with whom?

405
00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.953
Forgot about it.

406
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.793
What? Foreigners?

407
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.074
With the foreigners...

408
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.632
They bought an Angolan for eight million.

409
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.110
Who can't play.
- Dark as they come.


410
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.471
An Angolan. Can't play worth shit.

411
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.713
Dark as they come?

412
00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.880
Yes, dark as they come.
Can't play, but he thinks he owns...


413
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.311
... the island! 
Island monkey!

414
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.319
Not just that.
He thinks he owns all of Germany.


415
00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.274
To Germany!
- To Germany!


416
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.949
Germany!
- Germany!


417
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.596
Why the stupid look?
- Just today they gunned one down.


418
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.317
An Angolan?
- No, Turks.


419
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.160
Turks. Three of them.
- A father and two sons.


420
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.919
In the supermarket.

421
00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.750
Or do you have a bottle?
- Aisha, it's all wet here!


422
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.033
Yeah, someone did it...
- Thanks, so nice of you.


423
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.510
... at the supermarket.
- What's a Turk with a wooden leg?


424
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.233
Turkish lumber.

425
00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.957
Turkish lumber!

426
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.155
Let them bash each other's heads in.

427
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.273
Yeah, but where they come from, not here.

428
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.990
I agree.
- Cheers.


429
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.918
So they kill each other?

430
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.999
Like a clan feud, or what?
- Sure.


431
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.280
Of course.
- They're too dumb to kill each other.


432
00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.791
Could've been Germans too.

433
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.440
No idea, it'll be online tomorrow.
- Exactly.


434
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.359
To Germany!

435
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.591
Heil!

436
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.711
You have to speak slowly for him.

437
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.594
Dance on.
- Dance!


438
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.632
Hey, you two.
- Yeah.


439
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.759
Where do you work?

440
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.960
At Amazon.

441
00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.555
Amazon.

442
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.314
Oh yeah?
- Yeah.


443
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.516
Cool.
- Yeah, it really is cool.


444
00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.914
Super cool.

445
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.600
I just finished five weeks
of late shift.


446
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.191
Now it's time to party, right?

447
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.350
Party.

448
00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.877
You have to work tomorrow?

449
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.197
Uh... no.

450
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.599
No. I'm off too.

451
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.555
And what do you do?
- I go to university.


452
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.470
Yeah, I did that once too.

453
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.240
Yeah, then I got sick and tired

454
00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.553
of constantly

455
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.671
staring at a screen.

456
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.396
Then it's all for the best, huh?

457
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.115
Well, I'm still just staring at a screen.

458
00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.475
What did you say?

459
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.480
So the computer is your boss, huh?

460
00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.040
What nonsense!

461
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.758
No, of course not!

462
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.236
My boss is a person, of course!

463
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.594
He comes around every now and then

464
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.315
and then he stares at the computer too.

465
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.835
Oh, God!

466
00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.200
You're actually totally right,
the boss of my boss...


467
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.994
I mean...

468
00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.517
The computer is the boss of my boss.

469
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:30.310
Really. "You are working too slow.
Please hurry or you will get a spanking."


470
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.676
Are we going to fuck tonight?

471
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.354
What?

472
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.114
Nothing.

473
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.434
What?

474
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.475
It was a joke.
I wanted to see your reaction.


475
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.719
No, I...
- And them?


476
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.312
What about that guy, them?

477
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.917
They'll get some action tonight.

478
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.593
She's still mine.

479
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.000
I heard your gun's jammed.

480
00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.317
Hey...
- What?


481
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.909
What did you say?

482
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.157
Jamming gun - then you've got
to let others fire.


483
00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.392
No, really? Hey, stop.

484
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.752
Really.
- That has nothing to do with me and Becky.


485
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.759
Yes, it does.
- No, no. Come on. It's all good.


486
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.192
It's all right. Come on.

487
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.759
It's all in good fun.

488
00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.758
It's all right, come on.

489
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.951
Stop it. You're dancing with me.
- Hey!


490
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.675
You'll dance with me!
- I decide for myself!


491
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.997
You're nuts!
- You can dance with her in a bit.


492
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.873
You can't screw around in front of me.

493
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.357
I said you can dance with her in a bit, OK?
- Stop!


494
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.313
Stop! What are you doing?

495
00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.239
Is there trouble?
- No, no.


496
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.875
Aisha!
- I want you out of here now!


497
00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.753
He drank too much.
- Now!


498
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.670
Finish your beer
and get out of here right away.


499
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.396
I don't want trouble.
- Aisha, you're causing trouble.


500
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.120
No, I want you gone now.

501
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.193
Everything OK?

502
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.956
Come on.
- No, no...


503
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.516
Come.
- No, no...


504
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.596
You also want it.
- What?


505
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.876
Come on.
- No,No,No...


506
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.394
Come here.

507
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.154
Sh! No, no. Hey!

508
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.874
Is the door closed?

509
00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.631
Is the door closed?

510
00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.520
Close the door.

511
00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.237
"After financial irregularities
were revealed


512
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.189
in a Turkish aid society,
the victim was murdered."


513
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.512
Why don't they write about us?

514
00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.709
"There was a clash among refugees."

515
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.919
Fuck.

516
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.759
What s up with you?

517
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.517
Hello. Hi.

518
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.996
I was thinking about you the whole time.
I was worried about you.


519
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.631
Don't fall over.
- What's up?


520
00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.950
Don't let me fall!
What are you doing?


521
00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.072
You guys doing well?
- Yeah.


522
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.996
Play something nice. Go on.

523
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.275
Go on.

524
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.671
Do the tower.
- No!


525
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.477
Show me the Eiffel Tower.

526
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.194
Hey. Hey!

527
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.516
Leave him his guitar at least.

528
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.352
Dude, come on! Stop!
- Tommi!


529
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.517
Hey!
- Don't touch my damn guitar!


530
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.793
I was playing, man!

531
00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.754
Give me the guitar!
I'll punch you!


532
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.999
Where is that prick?

533
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.995
Unbelievable.
What are you ordering?


534
00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.436
It's all too expensive, forget it.

535
01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.394
There they are.

536
01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.557
Hi.
- There you are.


537
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.877
This is Susann.
- Hi.


538
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.076
Maik.

539
01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.593
Is that stain from jerking off?

540
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.794
Nonsense.

541
01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.755
Ouzo. Here you are.

542
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.836
I don't quite believe this.

543
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.078
May I take your order?
- Whatever what you want. It's on me.


544
01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:44.115
I will take...
- I think we need a bit more time.


545
01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.034
To you guys.

546
01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.390
Hey!

547
01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.990
Cheers to us?

548
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.192
Are you kidding me?
Tommi, are you out of your mind?


549
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.039
I know it's strange...

550
01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.795
What's strange?

551
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.920
What's strange?
- Stop it!


552
01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.192
What's strange?
- Stop it!


553
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.916
What's strange?
- Are you kidding me?


554
01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.280
What's strange?
- I thought it was about time we all met.


555
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.874
Yeah! Great idea!

556
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.878
We don't even know her.

557
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.878
You fucked in the head?

558
01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.198
You fucked in the head?
- Becky, it's all OK. Please.


559
01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.278
He told me a
lot about you. I know.

560
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.679
Does she know?

561
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.830
What does she know, damn it?
- Susanne wants to join us.


562
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.316
I was thinking...
- Join us?


563
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.394
Tommi said...
- You want to join us?


564
01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.476
What a great idea!
Real nice of him.


565
01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.279
He said it's nothing for me,
but I'm serious.


566
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.075
I really will make a contribution.

567
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.429
Who else knows you're in town?

568
01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.789
No one.

569
01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.992
But we have rules that must be followed.
- I know.


570
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.556
Of course, I'm the new girl.
- The new girl?


571
01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.838
How cute you are.

572
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.957
Such a cute little thing.

573
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.760
Let's drink to that, then.
To the new girl.


574
01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.839
OK, unfortunately,
we can't afford to feed another person.


575
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.800
I'll really do anything you want.

576
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.480
Anything you say.
- Anything? Really?


577
01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.917
So? Have you decided yet?
- Yes, uh...


578
01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.078
I think we'll leave. Sorry.

579
01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.240
Now what?

580
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.394
And? Any idea where we should go now?

581
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.552
Sorry, that was dumb! All of it.
- That wasn't dumb, you planned it that way!


582
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.031
Her joining would've been best for us all.

583
01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.915
You knew that's impossible.
You knew from the start I'd say no.


584
01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.836
There are three of us.
You can't just join, and screw it all up!


585
01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.637
Hey!

586
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.077
Then I'll set us all on fire!

587
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.479
That's what you want!
- You nuts?


588
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.160
Isn't that what you want?

589
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.113
You want us all to die here!

590
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.109
That's what you want!

591
01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.351
I can hardly breathe
with all these fucking fumes!


592
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.310
Get a grip on yourself, you idiot!

593
01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.870
Act like a man for once!
Get it! Like a man!


594
01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.032
Then you'll feel better.

595
01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.633
Stop that shit. Out!

596
01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.799
Get out, the both of you.

597
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.196
Piss off! Out! Out!

598
01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.960
Get lost!

599
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.710
Give me the key. The damned key!
- What?


600
01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.673
No! You crazy?
- The key!


601
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.679
Give me the key.
- What are you doing, man?


602
01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.678
You nuts?
- The place is about to burn!


603
01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.554
What are you doing?
Stop! What are you doing?


604
01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.357
Hurry up.

605
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.400
Where? Fuck where?
- Take this right!


606
01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.196
Scream at me again and I'll smack you!
- Hurry, they're about to close.


607
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.072
Take it.
Do everything. Be careful!


608
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.874
They're not closing,
it's way too early.


609
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.631
Go slower here!
- That it?


610
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.315
Scream at me again and I'll smack you!

611
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.917
Ten refugees to every lawyer.
- Quiet!


612
01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.351
Here. Slower!
- Ten!


613
01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.314
You wait for us, got it?
Keep the engine running.


614
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.511
And don't leave me hanging again, got it!
- Yes.


615
01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.155
Right...
- There won't be ten lawyers!


616
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.317
You got the gun?
- I have it.


617
01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.513
One, two, three... 
It's showtime!

618
01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.518
Ready?
- Here we go!


619
01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.591
Where's your boss?

620
01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.235
Boss not here.
- Where's your boss?


621
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.273
Where are the lawyers?

622
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.718
Where are the fucking lawyers?
- Not here. Gone home.


623
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.073
What?
- Not here!


624
01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.636
I don't believe it!
- Damn it!


625
01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.911
That was so stupid!
- Take our money.


626
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.477
Take our money!
- What?


627
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.111
Then shoot her!

628
01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:34.911
No!

629
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:38.911
Shit!

630
01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.757
Hey, Tommi!

631
01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.435
Tommi!

632
01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.439
That was still cool. It was great.

633
01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.473
Wasn't it cool?

634
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.759
Tell me you liked it!

635
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.074
That was cool!

636
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.799
Was that cool?

637
01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.791
It was cool! Yes. It was.

638
01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.351
Are you crazy?
- Come on.


639
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.156
"Don't understand..." Oh man!

640
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.314
He had to go
if he doesn't understand. Here.


641
01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.117
"Boss not here."

642
01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.233
"Gone home."

643
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.751
What were they thinking?
That we'd just leave again?


644
01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.310
These cowards... no honor.

645
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.239
"Please, please! 
Please take money."

646
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.872
"Please!"
- Yes, thank you, that's enough now!


647
01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.594
Couldn't have been that cool.

648
01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.191
It was pretty cool.
- Pretty cool, right?


649
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.313
They'll just be replaced tomorrow.

650
01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.592
It's pointless.
- Calm down! Here, have a schnapps.


651
01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:33.949
Come on.
- But what's the point?


652
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.311
Besides you having your fun?

653
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.912
Playing romper room and I'm the fucking driver?
- You go next time.


654
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.516
Huh?

655
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.237
I bet it won't all be fun and games.
- Stop. Stop it!


656
01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.399
Oh, Becky, drive faster!

657
01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.513
Oh, come on.

658
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.550
Dude!

659
01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.033
What are you doing?

660
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.595
Perfect!

661
01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.157
That's...
- You're not really?


662
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.839
Holy shit.

663
01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.790
You're serious? No way!
- You're not...


664
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.400
No way.

665
01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.910
Yeah!

666
01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.434
Come in!

667
01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.839
Man, how stupid.

668
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.955
What a complete retard.
- What's he doing?


669
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:48.274
No joke, he's crazy.
We really found ourselves a complete idiot.


670
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.160
I'm sick of it.
- Come in!


671
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.919
No, I'm cold.

672
01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.630
Lovely!
- I'm cold.


673
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.839
Are you OK?

674
01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.599
Germany!

675
01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.632
Come in! Let's swim.

676
01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.879
Get in!

677
01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.796
Tommi?

678
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.116
Becky?

679
01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.674
Prudes.

680
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.234
What the hell?

681
01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.111
What's going on?
Everything OK?


682
01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.919
No idea. We got back
and Becky got chatty with them.


683
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:34.273
Just put it in the back.
- Why did you go? I thought it was the cops.


684
01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.798
Bang-bang!

685
01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.834
On your knees!

686
01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.475
Headshot!

687
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.837
Headshot! Headshot!

688
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.714
Headshot! Headshot!

689
01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.396
Knock it off!
- No.


690
01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.834
Hi.
- Hi.


691
01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.759
Got a light?

692
01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.633
Here.
- Thanks.


693
01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.396
Is it okay if I
sit down for a moment?

694
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.110
You can tell me.
I understand. It is odd.


695
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.952
Some old dude sitting next to you
and chatting you up.


696
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.675
No need to be afraid of me.
I'm harmless.


697
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.674
I'm not.

698
01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.554
I'm actually a good guy.

699
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.315
You know...

700
01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.190
Deep down,
I'm really a good guy.


701
01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.755
I'm going somewhere else afterwards.

702
01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.277
You can come along if you want.

703
01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.955
Yeah?

704
01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.518
Yeah, maybe.
- Maybe what? You coming or not?


705
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.000
I don't think so.

706
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.269
That's what I always say!
We're all the same shit!


707
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.997
Shit! Are we not?
- But you have that everywhere.


708
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.715
It doesn't fucking matter.
You have it...


709
01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.872
You have it in soccer.

710
01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.959
You have it in politics, in religion.

711
01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.516
Everywhere.
- Yeah right, soccer!


712
01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.553
Soccer too.
- It's never your fault.


713
01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.480
Never! It never was my fault!

714
01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.956
Then love is to blame.
- What bullshit!


715
01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.753
Right?
- Yeah, love.


716
01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.996
Love.
- Love.


717
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.476
It's time to clean up!

718
01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.320
Where? In soccer?
- In this country.


719
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.591
In this country?
- In all countries!


720
01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.600
And then?
- But... that's a bit difficult.


721
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.192
If it doesn't come from politicians
people will take it into their own hands.


722
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.993
I think so too.

723
01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.079
You guys know what?

724
01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.839
It wasn't too long ago,
and not very far from here,


725
01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.076
some foreigners got offed.

726
01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.913
They said at the time

727
01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.714
that it was "criminal clans"
or something.


728
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.951
So I say to Rosie,
"Rosie," I say,


729
01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.876
"I hope it wasn't Nazis who did it."

730
01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.675
That's what I said, right? Didn't I?

731
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.918
Just imagine.

732
01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.120
Nazis. Lovely.
- Yeah, lovely.


733
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:04.916
I think we have to go home.
- Why? It's just getting good!


734
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.156
Yeah...

735
01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:10.560
I think we should call it a night, too.
- You think?


736
01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.877
You usually blab about politics.

737
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.549
I don't know what you mean.
I need my jacket.


738
01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.229
Are you embarrassed
in front of these people?


739
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.478
Just when I'm feeling good
for five minutes!


740
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.072
OK? Can you just stop for once?

741
01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.072
Who always says, "Dago! Polack!
Off to the gas chambers!"


742
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.033
Shut up! Shut up!

743
01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.118
Shut your fucking mouth!

744
01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.720
Shut your mouth!

745
01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.239
What's wrong?
- You shut your mouth too! Get away!


746
01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.879
What happened?

747
01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.235
What? What are you all staring at?

748
01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.676
Sorry.
- Grab your stuff.


749
01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.036
Go.

750
01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.756
Tommi, can you stop annoying us
with that shit for two seconds?


751
01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.317
This is it.

752
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.634
Holy shit.

753
01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.750
No lights after dark, no cell phones.

754
01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.352
Everything else good with you?

755
01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.034
Need anything?

756
01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:02.037
We need a silencer.
- You don't need silencers in here.


757
01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.076
Is anyone even noticing anything?

758
01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.714
We'll see.

759
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.957
No new operations for now.

760
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.870
Lay low for a while.

761
01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.073
Shit! Fuck!

762
01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.040
Stupid asshole.

763
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.197
Stupid fucking asshole!

764
01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.834
That sucks!

765
01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.271
Hey.

766
01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:41.160
Man, I don't feel like it,
not up for it. OK?


767
01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.635
Hey.

768
01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.991
Man, I don't feel like it, OK?

769
01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.513
This is all fucked up.

770
01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.917
So fucked up. Nobody is even
interested in what we're doing.


771
01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.474
And now we're stuck here.
- Who cares what anyone out there thinks.


772
01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.313
We keep going.
- Because we're so cool, right?


773
01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.751
But if no one notices what we're doing,
it's not worth shit!


774
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.673
I am going crazy in here!

775
01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.951
Man! Just screw off, will you!

776
01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.199
We keep going.

777
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.469
What? You don't even say hello?

778
01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.120
We need a silencer.

779
01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.596
Forget it.
You're lucky I even came out here.


780
01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.509
We bust our ass
and then get told off?


781
01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.076
You fucked it up.
- You fucked it up!


782
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.240
All your operations are totally pointless.

783
01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.716
And why? Because of you!

784
01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.232
Nobody even notices what we're doing,
except state security and some comrades.


785
01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.397
Otherwise, nobody cares.

786
01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.352
From now on keep quiet. Got it?
- We won't be told what to do anymore.


787
01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.833
We do what we please.

788
01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.874
Oh yeah?
I snap my finger and they have you.


789
01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.514
One call.

790
01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.872
Then we'll take you out too.
- I want to read something about us.


791
01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.357
You can't set conditions here.

792
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.791
But that's what we're doing.

793
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.835
Tommi.

794
01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.955
Hands up!
Get over to the cash register!


795
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.395
Open the register!

796
01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.400
Do it! Open the register! Do it!

797
01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.919
Give us the money! Come on!

798
01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.675
Come on!
- Open the register!


799
01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.350
Damn it!
- The money!


800
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.273
Open it!

801
01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.111
Open it!
- Do it!


802
01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.233
Do it! Now!
- Come on!


803
01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.999
Open it!
- Do it, now!


804
01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.270
Do something! Do something!

805
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.553
You're not quite right!

806
01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.674
You stupid fuck!

807
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.191
Are you out of your mind?

808
01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.154
Oh Fuck!

809
01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.111
Stop! Stop!

810
01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.559
Come on, man!

811
01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.592
Come on, now!

812
01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.830
Shit!

813
01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:27.035
Shit! Are we going to
leave them here now, or what?


814
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.153
Stop it, now!

815
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.278
Tommi, stop!

816
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.760
OK. OK.

817
01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.717
Come on.
- Come on, man.


818
01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:52.276
I'm going to be sick.
- Come on now.


819
01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.674
Hey, no!

820
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.516
Stop it.

821
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.640
He was blond, didn't you see that?
- So what?


822
01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.549
He looked Eastern European.
- He was a German!


823
01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.592
Are you completely insane?

824
01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.072
You've got to be kidding me!

825
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.674
We need the fucking money, that's it!

826
01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.838
I'll never get rid of that.

827
01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.797
I'll never get rid of it!

828
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.753
I'll never get rid of it!

829
01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.997
Shut your face!

830
01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.237
Shut your mouth!

831
01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.638
You two are such complete idiots!

832
01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.477
I knew it would end this way.

833
01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.479
I knew it!

834
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.799
He can't take it.

835
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.277
Not at all! He totally loses it!
Why is he even here?


836
01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.517
You belong in an asylum!
- Me?


837
01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.316
Know what?

838
01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.877
Your whining is really getting on my...
- Now just wait!


839
01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:08.471
What do you want?
What the hell do you guys want?


840
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.593
What?

841
01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.876
Fuck you!

842
01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:16.920
Piss off!
Do your shit without me!


843
01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.631
Do your shit without me!
- No problem.


844
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.355
Leave me alone!
- No problem.


845
01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.875
Just leave me alone.

846
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.313
We're leaving. We don't need you.
All you do is slow us down anyway!


847
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.199
Micky?
- No.


848
01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.074
No what?

849
01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.751
What do you mean no?
- You think you have a say here? You don't!


850
01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:37.916
Oh?

851
01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.112
Without me, you're a total failure.

852
01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.038
Without me, you can't do shit.

853
01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.436
Nothing!

854
01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.349
What'll you do without me?
- She always said that to me too.


855
01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:49.310
You fucking witch! Get lost!

856
01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:53.270
You're why we screw it all up.
You're slowing us down!


857
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.837
With your depressive bullshit
and your jabbering!


858
01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.190
You know what?

859
01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.040
You two faggots
can fuck each other in the ass!


860
01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.598
Fuck each other in the ass
in this shitty shed, you homos!


861
01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:06.319
What did you say?

862
01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.196
I said you two are fucking homos.

863
01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.633
Knock off that crap.

864
01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:18.040
Shut your fucking mouth!

865
01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.197
Shut your mouth!

866
01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.632
You're good at that, huh?
You're so good at that!


867
01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.116
All you can do is beat people up!

868
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:32.119
Nothing else, huh? Nothing?
- No, nothing!


869
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.953
Stop with this crap!
- That's how you guys wanted it, huh?


870
01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.559
We'll throw out the old witch
and open our gay wonderland!


871
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.951
Go on, get started.
Go on, fuck each other in the ass.


872
01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.994
Fuck each other in the ass!

873
01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.556
Go on, get started.

874
01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.517
You two are so ridiculous!

875
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:12.554
You are so ridiculous!

876
01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.034
Stop.

877
01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.591
Stop. Stop!

878
01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.360
Stop it!

879
01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.589
Stop, stop!

880
01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.032
Shut your mouth.
- Stop.


881
01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.995
Stop! Tommi!

882
01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.591
Oh, God. Oh, God.

883
01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.110
Shit!

884
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.120
Is it OK?

885
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.430
Yeah.

886
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.071
Catch it! Catch it!

887
01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.630
How much?

888
01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.949
Not much.

889
01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.629
Hey.

890
01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.314
Tell me.

891
01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.474
Do you love me?

892
01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.114
Cut the crap.

893
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.831
Say it!
- Cut the crap.


894
01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.599
Come on, say it!

895
01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:06.394
Drop it!

896
01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.636
Say it.

897
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.195
Uh...

898
01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.075
Say it.
- Yes...


899
01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.314
Yes what?

900
01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.394
Yes what?
- Yes!


901
01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.195
Yes what?

902
01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.869
Say that you love me, man!
- Yes, I...


903
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.034
Yes?

904
01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.231
Yes...

905
01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.999
Say that you love me!

906
01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:27.951
Yes...

907
01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:31.156
Say it!
- I... I love you.


908
01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.194
You love me?
- Yes, yes.


909
01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.959
I love you, man.

910
01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.438
They don't notice a damn thing.
- Fucking mafia.


911
01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.159
See how he looked at me?
The son of a bitch.


912
01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.354
Did you?
Did you see how he looked at me?


913
01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.318
OK, slow down.

914
01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:09.795
They're making out. Did you see?
- Yeah?


915
01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.912
They made out!
- Let's get them!


916
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.473
Come on, man!

917
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:38.075
Yeah. Yeah!

918
01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:41.273
Yeah!
- Fuck, yeah!


919
01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.399
Drive, drive!

920
01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.635
OK.

921
01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.357
Hello.

922
01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.797
Fuck! It's the cops!

923
01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.195
It's not the cops.
- Still!


924
01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.600
You scared?

925
01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.437
Are you trying to get us killed?

926
01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.760
Come on.

927
01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:16.911
Come on.
What's wrong with you?


928
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.394
Hey.

929
01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.389
Hey, what are you doing with the gun?

930
01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.315
Hey!

931
01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:54.919
Hey, Micky!

932
01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.354
Sit down.

933
01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:03.797
Man, just sit down.

934
01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.240
Put the gun away, man.

935
01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.799
Put the gun away.

936
01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.559
Please. Come on.

937
01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.232
Knock it off!

938
01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.439
I'm ready now, Micky.

939
01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.632
You and me, we'll clean up.

940
01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:56.993
I've been holding back so far, but now...
- Just look at you.


941
01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.669
Look at me. We look like shit.

942
01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:03.438
But it'll get better.
It'll get better, I swear.


943
01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.280
I swear.

944
01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:22.831
Becky has to come back.

945
01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:27.596
You have to swing it somehow.

946
01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.755
Straight ahead.

947
01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.354
Can I help you?

948
01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:26.633
We're looking for Becky.

949
01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.320
Is she here?

950
01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.837
Hello, first of all.
- Hello.


951
01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:37.394
You don't remember me, do you?
- Yes, I do.


952
01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:40.279
I remember you very well.

953
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.191
What do you want from my daughter?

954
01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.278
Becky?
- Leave.


955
01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.514
It's OK, Mom.

956
01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.074
It's OK.

957
01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.879
We have cake.

958
01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.033
Have a seat then.

959
01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.839
I'll make coffee.

960
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:36.194
Coming here was the dumbest thing
you could do.


961
01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.679
We need you.

962
01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.429
You realize that now?
- It'll all be different now.


963
01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.838
We'll pull out all the stops.

964
01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:48.396
Sure.

965
01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.273
No compromises. Now I get it.

966
01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.552
You really believe that, huh?

967
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.231
We won't hide like they want us to.

968
01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:01.153
That's over now.

969
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.553
There's no reason to.

970
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.392
We can be proud of ourselves.

971
01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:09.915
It feels wrong without you.

972
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.789
Please.

973
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.912
I can't do it anymore.

974
01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.111
Stop it.
- Is there a problem?


975
01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.553
What happened?

976
01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:38.315
They came to take me with them, Mom.

977
01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:44.276
We're going to take Becky with us.
- I don't think so.


978
01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:46.472
Not if she doesn't want to.

979
01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:49.631
She didn't say she doesn't want to.

980
01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:52.678
You stay here, Becca.

981
01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:57.557
Don't listen to them. I don't know
what kind of relationship you have...


982
01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:01.794
I'm grown up. I can speak for myself.
- In this case, you can't.


983
01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.032
I can tell something's wrong here.
Something's off.


984
01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:09.670
I'm entitled to protect my daughter, right?
- Oh, yeah?


985
01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:13.158
That would be a first.

986
01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.072
Is that how you talk to me?

987
01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.877
I'd like you to leave now.

988
01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:24.232
We'll leave when we want to.
And we're taking Becky.


989
01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:26.955
I should not have let the likes of you
in my house.


990
01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:30.519
I can't believe the people
you associate with!


991
01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:34.511
Pack your things, we're leaving.
- I won't let anyone order me around!


992
01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:37.758
No, no, no.
You're staying here, you got that?


993
01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.791
You're good for nothing!

994
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.469
Look at these misfits you hang around with.

995
01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:46.232
I'm such a misfit too, aren't I?

996
01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:48.233
Now get a grip, missy!

997
01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.439
That's enough!
I'm calling the police.


998
01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.550
No, no, no!

999
01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:56.600
No, Mom. Stop it! Stop!

1000
01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.600
Don't! Mom!
What are you doing?


1001
01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.032
We've killed people!

1002
01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.712
Who've you killed, Rebecca?
- Foreigners, Mom, we killed foreigners!


1003
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.754
You killed people? Really?

1004
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.033
Where did that happen?

1005
01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.751
I haven't heard a thing.
You're not even capable of such a thing.


1006
01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:16.996
Ow!

1007
01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:21.156
You stupid bitch.
- Ow.


1008
01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.794
We killed them!

1009
01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.037
Shit, let's go, Becky.

1010
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.512
You are an evil child!

1011
01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:33.315
Hey!

1012
01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:43.678
When the police come
you don't know anything, OK?


1013
01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.555
It's not true what Becky said.

1014
01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.753
We're nice people.
Respectable people.


1015
01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:02.233
Yeah!

1016
01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:10.759
Fuck, yeah!
Now it's time to clean house!


1017
01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:31.953
Point the gun at me.

1018
01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.714
Yes.

1019
01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:52.434
Undress, strip off.

1020
01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.920
Is the gun loaded?

1021
01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:08.470
Sexy!

1022
01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.953
Come on! Let's go!

1023
01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.472
Go ahead and kiss.

1024
01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.874
Come.

1025
01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:28.240
Wait, I need something to drink.

1026
01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.234
Come on.

1027
01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:24.713
What's wrong?
- Sorry.


1028
01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:26.396
What?

1029
01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.954
Did you come?

1030
01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:29.719
What the fuck?

1031
01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:31.149
Seriously?

1032
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.839
What were the two
nappy headed niggers doing in bed?


1033
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.198
Taking a nap!

1034
01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.279
That tickles!

1035
01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:46.876
Who is this? Who is it?

1036
01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.394
You?

1037
01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:54.677
The cold ones are Micky's.

1038
01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.557
We're the greatest!

1039
01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:14.353
We're the greatest.

1040
01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:16.958
Here comes the storm.

1041
01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:18.753
Stop, I'm going in the middle.

1042
01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:20.519
I'm in the middle.
- What?


1043
01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:24.799
Come on, come on.

1044
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.914
That's mean.
- Uh-uh.


1045
01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:32.878
The middle is best.

1046
01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.959
It's so cool.

1047
01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:41.751
They can't keep us down now.
They can't ignore us anymore.


1048
01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.510
There's no good picture of me.

1049
01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:48.958
For the newspaper, you mean?

1050
01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.992
Not a single photo!

1051
01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:57.358
My uncle has one.
Maybe I'll just call him.


1052
01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.517
Yeah.
- They can use that.


1053
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.559
For the papers.

1054
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.117
Waszec...

1055
01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:09.079
If Waszec reads that...

1056
01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.400
I'm just imagining
how they'll tell stories about us.


1057
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.957
Like a legend or something.

1058
01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:27.351
About our love too.

1059
01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:30.440
Just like hippies.

1060
01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:35.518
But it's beautiful, isn't it?

1061
01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:43.080
What are you doing?

1062
01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.316
What are you doing?
- What?


1063
01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:52.274
I don't want to die!
Let us alone.


1064
01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.473
I'm going out there! I'm surrendering!
- No!


1065
01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:58.752
No, stay here.
- If I put my hands up they won't shoot.


1066
01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:01.600
Then they won't shoot!
- You won't go out.


1067
01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:04.360
No, they won't shoot!
- Stop it!


1068
01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:07.037
I hate you.
- I love you.


1069
01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:10.079
Fuck you! I hate you!
- I'm sorry.


1070
01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:16.951
Tommi, Tommi...

1071
01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.474
I'm scared!

1072
01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:23.072
Police!
- Get on the ground!


1073
01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:28.029
Hands on your back!
Turn over!


1074
01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:32.910
On the ground, hands behind your back!

1075
01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.752
Micky! Micky!

1076
01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:38.554
Where is the weapon?

1077
01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.273
Get up, you swine!
Get up, bastard!


1078
01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:45.119
These dogs!

1079
01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:48.478
The police... You assholes!

1080
01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:50.911
I don't want to!

1081
01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:52.190
I don't want to!

1082
02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:05.636
Open the door.
- Open it up!


1083
02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:09.114
Get in there, God damn it!

1084
02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:20.991
Becky!

1085
02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.756
Hey, Becky! Becky!

1086
02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:32.959
Come on.

1087
02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:00.278
You are really dumb

1088
02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:04.559
that's why you're feeling fine.

1089
02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:09.194
Hate is your attitude

1090
02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:13.798
your blood boils constantly.

1091
02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:18.433
Everything needs to be explained to you

1092
02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:22.954
because you really don't know anything

1093
02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:31.877
most likely not even what attitude means!

1094
02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:41.199
Your violence is only
a silent cry for love

1095
02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:49.360
your combat boots long for tenderness

1096
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.396
you have never learned to articulate yourself

1097
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:08.798
and your parents never
had time for you.. ohhh...

1098
02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:14.080
... asshole!

1099
02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:31.798
Why do you have fear of caressing

1100
02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:36.198
what's the meaning of all this nonsense?

1101
02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:41.038
Under the laurel wreath with acorns

1102
02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:45.198
I know your heart beats

1103
02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:53.992
and romanticism is only
grey theory for you


1104
02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:03.391
between Störkraft and the Onkelz is a Kuschelrock
LP!


1105
02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:12.360
Your violence is only
a silent cry for love

1106
02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:20.960
your combat boots long for tenderness

1107
02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:30.677
you have never learned to articulate yourself

1108
02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:40.392
and your parents never
had time for you... ohhh...
