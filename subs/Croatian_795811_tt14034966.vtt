00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.200
<i>Episode 1: Magic</i>
<i>(or Something Less Assuring)</i>


3
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.700
Really pretty!

4
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.070
I like the eyelashes
reflecting the light.


5
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.820
Let's try the hat.

6
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.620
- There's something here.
- Thanks.


7
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.740
Okay. Let me take a look now.

8
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.620
Give us a minute, please.

9
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.990
- Good.
- Yep.


10
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.950
- They're very good.
- Yes.


11
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.820
- I'm happy with these. You guys?
- Yep. Me, too.


12
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.620
- Okay!
- Good job, everyone!


13
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.320
Yay, we're done!

14
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.490
- Thank you, bye.
- Take care!


15
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.820
- Ride with me.
- Is it okay?


16
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.870
- See you later.
- See you!


17
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.320
- Take care.
- Thanks, bye.


18
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.120
What?!

19
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.490
You just met him!
How'd you click so well?


20
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.240
Well, at some point,
he started saying...


21
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.570
"Tsu, you're not
who I thought you were."


22
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.870
"Tsu"?

23
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.240
The bar owner suggested
nicknames for us,


24
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.370
"Tsu" for Tsugumi, "Ka" for Kazuaki.

25
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.450
So, I asked him
what he thought of me initially.


26
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.820
He thought I was beautiful when we met.

27
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.570
- Yup...
- Well, well...


28
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.490
But he was under the impression
that I was aloof


29
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.370
because of our email exchanges
before we met.


30
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.320
That's the way business communication
should be.


31
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.240
But you know how friendly I am.

32
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.620
So, he was like,
"The contrast blew me away."


33
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.490
Then I said, "Hang on.
You're a fine one to talk."


34
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.370
Honestly, he seemed like a player.

35
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.990
- A player!
- Well, not exactly.


36
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.240
I should say, he's a hottie.

37
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.570
- A hottie isn't the same as a player.
- I mean...


38
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.820
He struck me as
a ladies' man at times,

39
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.370
but not in a negative way.

40
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.620
He says his home office is in Aoyama.

41
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.120
That's players' haven!

42
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.200
Hmm, I don't know about that.

43
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.120
What does he do?

44
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.870
He heads an interior design company
and invests.


45
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.870
Now he sounds...like a player.

46
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.620
Really, Gumi?
You don't like players.


47
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.370
I know. I'm surprised that
I find his company so much fun.


48
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.620
I see.

49
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.120
I declined the business offer
and he accepted.


50
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.320
But we kept chatting and
two hours passed before we knew it.


51
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.370
Then, it went from "Wanna grab coffee?"
to "Do you drink?"


52
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.370
And we missed the last train.

53
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.240
Amazing. How long were you together?

54
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.240
The meeting started at 1 PM,
so 15 hours all together.


55
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.990
- No way!
- I know.


56
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.820
Somehow, we started talking
about our childhoods.


57
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.120
We found we had similar upbringings
and moved around a lot.


58
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.370
We quickly realized that's why we both
approach people from a distance.


59
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.490
I told him about things
I've never told anybody,


60
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.700
not even to you, Meiko,
and he did the same.


61
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.700
Maybe he was mirroring me to be nice.

62
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.820
But...

63
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.870
I could sense that
I touched something deep within him...


64
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.240
and I felt he touched me
deep within, too.


65
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.570
That sounds...erotic.

66
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.820
Doesn't it?

67
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.200
Honestly, I felt something
very erotic about it.


68
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.070
I didn't know conversations
could be this erotic.


69
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.320
- Did you talk dirty?
- No.


70
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.450
No dirty talk, no physical touching.

71
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.820
I don't get it.

72
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.990
But we caressed each other
through our conversation.


73
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.870
That's damn erotic.

74
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.320
We ended up talking about
what we'd be like as a couple.


75
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.870
- You guys are in love!
- I guess.


76
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.490
We both sensed
we were falling for each other,


77
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.950
or at least we got along really well.

78
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.820
In fact, we thought,
we can do it.


79
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.870
That's not dirty?

80
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.620
No. Our talk flowed naturally
in that direction.


81
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.120
You're so mature!

82
00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.620
But we were like, "Nah, not today."
So, we said goodbye and took taxis home.


83
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.120
What? Why not?

84
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.450
- No, no, no...
- No?


85
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.740
Is sex on the first date common?

86
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.740
I don't know, but in your case,
you could have.


87
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.240
Hmm, you're right about that.

88
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.490
How about you, Meiko?
Have you ever...?


89
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.120
What do you mean?

90
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.120
Doing it on the first date.

91
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.620
No, not the first date.

92
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.370
The second or third time?

93
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.320
Yeah, that happens.

94
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.950
- Never done it?
- No.


95
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.620
I can't. That's too fast for me.

96
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.620
Most guys want it by the third time.

97
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.700
I know. So, I put them in
"the players" basket.


98
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.490
Gumi, you're harsh!

99
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.740
- You and I are different on this one.
- Yup.


100
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.820
To be honest...

101
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.700
it wasn't a bad idea.

102
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.620
I've never felt I could
on the first date.


103
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.240
Actually, I wanted to.

104
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.240
I wondered what we'd be like afterwards.

105
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.740
If the convo was that good...

106
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.370
I thought about consequences
and felt a bit unsure.


107
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.240
But I think I was giving him signals.

108
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.200
What kinda signals?

109
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.990
I won't tell you. I can't.

110
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.490
- Oh, c'mon!
- It just happened in that moment.


111
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:34.740
You know...it was him who held back.

112
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.700
He couldn't get it up?

113
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.870
- Oh, shush!
- Ow!


114
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.240
In a nutshell,

115
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.120
he couldn't bring himself
to it mentally.


116
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.490
He said...

117
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.950
him and his ex broke up
because she cheated.


118
00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.620
Ah...that sounds familiar...

119
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.950
Yeah, cheater! Apologize.

120
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.620
Let us pray for forgiveness.

121
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.990
And you know, he got cheated on
more than once.


122
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.240
Uh-huh...

123
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.990
But he loved her so much and

124
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.490
it was so painful that
he probably can't love again.


125
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.490
When did that happen?

126
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.620
About two years ago.

127
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.950
- He's dwelling on it too long!
- I know! But...


128
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.740
I can empathize with that.

129
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.240
I see.

130
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.490
He also said he had lots of fun
with me but feels unprepared,


131
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.490
this came out of left field.

132
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.620
It excited him but

133
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.120
it also made him realize
he's scared of falling in love.


134
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.450
He said I reminded him of his ex.

135
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.120
- You look like her?
- No.


136
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.070
It wasn't my face or personality.

137
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.870
But, he'd never...

138
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.950
felt so at ease talking to someone.

139
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:18.240
Then, he remembered that he was never
able to talk like this with his ex.


140
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.950
Hmm...at ease...

141
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.740
Yeah, it caught my mind,
so I said,


142
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.200
"Feeling at ease isn't
the same as romance."


143
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.200
What'd he say?

144
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.120
"What do you think, Tsu?"

145
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.320
How annoying.

146
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.620
It's hard to explain the nuances.

147
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.740
We spent a really magical time together

148
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.320
and both felt we'd never
had an experience like it.


149
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:59.200
He said that, for us who have
always kept others at bay,


150
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.740
our paths crossing is special.

151
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.120
And I knew that he meant
what he said.


152
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:14.620
Then, he suggested we leave each other
at that and call it a day.


153
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:20.990
He said, "If the magic is gone
next time we meet, then let it be."


154
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.320
Magic, huh?

155
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.120
The word was perfect for us.

156
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.490
He said, "I honestly had
the best day of my life."


157
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:36.120
"It'll be great if our next meeting
turns out even better."


158
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.740
"I feel optimistic about us.
Let's hope we make it."


159
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.870
Then, we shook hands goodbye.

160
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.070
Seriously?

161
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.490
Are you scared about next time?

162
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.320
I am...very much so.

163
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.490
And yet I want to see him. Soon.

164
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.740
Gumi, you look lovely.

165
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.120
You're glowing right now.

166
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.870
Thanks.

167
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.370
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


168
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.120
Thanks a lot.

169
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.700
- Good night.
- See you.


170
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.240
Excuse me.

171
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.820
Do you mind going back the same way?

172
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.570
Is the president in?

173
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.620
- Pardon?
- May I come in?


174
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.370
And you are...?

175
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.870
I'm his friend.

176
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.490
Excuse me.

177
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.620
Yes?

178
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.820
I need a word.

179
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.120
Ms. Morita, you can go.

180
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.700
But...

181
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.070
I'll be fine. I
can do the rest myself.

182
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.200
Sure.

183
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.740
- Good night.
- Good night.


184
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.070
Good night.

185
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.620
Cute.

186
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.370
What?

187
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.620
You've moved your office.

188
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.370
The old one was cute, too.

189
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.370
Where's your bed now?

190
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.740
Upstairs.

191
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.370
I see.

192
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.820
You look successful.

193
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.370
What do you want to talk about?

194
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.120
I heard you started investing.

195
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.370
Can you handle that?
I never saw you as the type.


196
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.200
Who told you that?

197
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.370
You two spent a magical time together.

198
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.450
"Tsu" and "Ka"?

199
00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.740
You guys are lame.

200
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.870
You know her?

201
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.120
You mean, Gumi?

202
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.740
My best friend.

203
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.070
"Gumi"?

204
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.990
Because she's Tsugumi.
We had a shoot today.


205
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.820
Are you surprised?

206
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.990
Surprised? It's rather hard to believe.

207
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.990
What's so hard to believe?

208
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.990
She told you about me?

209
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.740
Not exactly.

210
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.700
I realized she was talking about you.

211
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.490
Did you tell her about us?

212
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.490
No, I didn't. How could I?

213
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.870
Right.

214
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.740
Are you in love with Gumi?

215
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.120
- I don't know yet.
- How can you not?


216
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:04.990
"A magical time"?

217
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.370
"The best day of my life"?

218
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.370
Hey, stop that.

219
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.870
You think I'm jealous?

220
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.700
- Aren't you?
- Not at all.


221
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.240
I'm not at all
in love with you, Kazu.

222
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.570
You've hardly crossed my mind.

223
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.070
You got it easy.

224
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.990
You passed yourself off as

225
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.240
this traumatized guy who got cheated on.

226
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.070
Did she say that?

227
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.120
No. Partly my interpretation.

228
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.620
Who are you to probe into that night?

229
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120
"That night"?

230
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.120
Leave. You're acting like a stalker.
You're insane.


231
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.490
Don't worry.

232
00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.990
I'm aware of my insane behavior.

233
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.120
You're operating normally, then.

234
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.240
- You know me.
- Why'd you come?


235
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.240
Want to know?

236
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.320
I need to. I'm scared.

237
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.740
To tell the truth, I don't know.

238
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.370
Huh?

239
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.240
But there's nobody else
I can talk to about this.


240
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.370
Not Gumi, of course.

241
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.450
And I knew you'd listen to me
even after two years.


242
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.070
- How have you been?
- Listen to what?


243
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.620
I don't know.

244
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.950
But you used to enjoy hearing
what I had to say.


245
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:40.240
How've you been?

246
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.570
What do you want to know?

247
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:53.370
I got so pissed off when I heard
about you and her.


248
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.990
I felt sad, too.

249
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.740
But I'm not in love with you now.

250
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.320
- And you...
- Don't.


251
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.740
Maybe it's the loss of someone
I believed was mine.


252
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.700
I don't belong to you.

253
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.320
I'm talking about Gumi.

254
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.370
Look, woman.
That girl's not yours, either.


255
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.450
Why'd you just call me "woman"?

256
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.370
You've never spoke like that to me.

257
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.620
Say it again and I'll leave.

258
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.320
Woman. Leave.

259
00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.570
Also, I don't like how you
refer to Gumi as "that girl."


260
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.070
- Ms. Konno doesn't belong to you.
- What do you want?


261
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.120
I don't know yet.

262
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.200
Are you going to
sleep with her next time?


263
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.240
That's none of your business.

264
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.490
You're in for an ordinary,
boring relationship.


265
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:54.990
What are you saying?

266
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.620
You're gonna cry over that
enchanting first date...


267
00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.870
Are you cursing me?

268
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.990
- Maybe.
- What the hell?


269
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.820
Are you mad at me?

270
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.240
I'm not sure if I'm mad at you,

271
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.570
but maybe I am.

272
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.700
Then, at Tsugumi?

273
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.820
- Tsu's not at fault.
- Don't call her Tsu.


274
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.570
Well...

275
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.740
If I'm mad,
I'm probably mad at our fate.


276
00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:25.700
Fate?

277
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.370
Our fate's nobody's fault.

278
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.870
If there's anyone evil in this story,
it's you.


279
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.490
Why? Because I cheated on you?

280
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.740
You not only cheated but...

281
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.240
But...?

282
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.240
Your motive was disgusting.

283
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.200
You wanted to experience
sex with a rich man.


284
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.370
Yeah, I totally said that.

285
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.450
You're despicable.

286
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.950
Yeah, but that's because
you kept probing.


287
00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.570
I wasn't ready to verbalize my thoughts
but you forced me.


288
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.740
- The words didn't feel right.
- And the truth?


289
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.240
Sexual frustration.

290
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.570
And curiosity.

291
00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.870
You called me evil,

292
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.620
but what about you for leaving
me frustrated?


293
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.620
- I'm not your dildo.
- Dildos are better. Be humble.


294
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.070
What? You frightened me!

295
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.950
- Was that even yours?
- Leave.


296
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.490
I might lose control and kill you.

297
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.620
Then you'll never see Tsu again.

298
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.240
- Where are you going?
- Let go! I'm leaving.


299
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.490
- You live here.
- Get lost!


300
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.240
- Running away again?
- Yeah!


301
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.490
Why do you keep hurting me?

302
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.740
Don't know. It might be love.

303
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.820
When I was a kid,
I hurt the boys I liked.


304
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.990
Stop. I'll never let you fool me again.

305
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.740
I <i>might</i> love you.

306
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.820
- But I doubt it.
- What?


307
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.870
Isn't this fun?

308
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.620
- Not at all.
- There's rhythm in our spats.


309
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.370
Like the old days.

310
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:18.450
You're just pissed off about losing
the man you thought was yours.


311
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.700
You're only repeating what I said.

312
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.990
You've always had to have me loving you,

313
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.700
even after we separated,
even if you don't love me.


314
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.700
Yeah...maybe.

315
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.490
So leave.

316
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.120
We can't be together.
At least, I can't.


317
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.320
I see, but why is that?

318
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.870
I can't stand you.

319
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.120
But "you loved me so much."

320
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.450
I heard it from Gumi.

321
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.740
And you were devastated.

322
00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.070
But Kazu,
I bet you've never imagined...


323
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.070
What?

324
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.870
How badly I got hurt from hurting you.

325
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.200
No, no... Hold on.

326
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:18.950
That's too easy.

327
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.740
I can't help it, I love you.

328
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.370
I always have.

329
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.450
What about Gumi?

330
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.870
I told you I don't know yet.

331
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.240
My feelings for her are different.

332
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.240
If you hug me, Tsugumi will vanish.
Is that okay?


333
00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.620
And I can't guarantee
I'll become yours.


334
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.870
You might lose both.

335
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.620
I can't promise anything.

336
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.950
That's who I am. 
Can you accept me?

337
00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.950
I'm about to puke.

338
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.950
Have you always loved me? 
All this time?

339
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.120
I wonder...

340
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.740
- You just said so.
- On impulse.


341
00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.240
The truth sometimes
comes out impulsively.


342
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.870
I came here on impulse.

343
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.320
It's anything but the truth with you.

344
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.320
You think so?

345
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.870
At least, nothing assuring.

346
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.070
Right. Because I don't know.

347
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.370
- Why are you here?
- Are you sure about yourself?


348
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.870
Because you're not,
you're half-hearted about Gumi.


349
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.120
I really like Gumi.

350
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.370
She's amazing.

351
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.200
I think you're a good match.

352
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.370
But she's hard work.

353
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.370
She can be hardheaded.

354
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.450
I've gathered.

355
00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.120
You and Gumi are similar.

356
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.620
You might be right.

357
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.990
That's quite true.

358
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.990
What is it you loved about me?

359
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.450
That you're honest.

360
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.870
Yeah, I am...

361
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.740
You were a trustworthy person, Meiko.

362
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.700
But I cheated on you.

363
00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.990
Was it cheating?

364
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.070
I tried not to
see you as my belonging.

365
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.490
So that you wouldn't get hurt.

366
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.740
Can't you let that slide?

367
00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:03.200
Did you ever, even once,
try to truly face me?


368
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.950
I tried to understand you.

369
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.320
I listened to you
as much as I could.

370
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.120
Answer my question.

371
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.620
How do you mean "truly face"?

372
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.620
If you don't know, you'll repeat
the same mistakes with Tsugumi


373
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.320
and end up hurting her in the end.

374
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.620
Did you get hurt?

375
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.120
Yup.

376
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.240
Why?

377
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.950
All I can do is
hurt the ones I love.

378
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.620
Love's supposed to make people happy.

379
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.370
We had happy times.

380
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.450
I feel like a defective product.

381
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.570
You're not the only one.

382
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.950
I'm not even a dildo.

383
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.740
Because you're so kind...

384
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.450
you're not for me.

385
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:25.490
- You and Gumi will make a nice couple.
- I know.


386
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:27.820
Kazu.

387
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.070
Would you dare to believe in...

388
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.990
something less assuring than magic?

389
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.070
Sorry. I forgot my laptop.

390
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.700
Is she the woman you said
you had on your mind?


391
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.870
No, she isn't.

392
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.120
Then, why chase her?

393
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.120
Is it bad?

394
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.740
Of course it is.

395
00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.320
<i>Three days later...</i>

396
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.120
Gumi, did something good happen?

397
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.320
Why?

398
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.620
You look extra pretty.

399
00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.820
What?

400
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:25.200
The guy I told you about
asked me out tonight.


401
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.700
He wants to meet me for a chat.

402
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.240
I see.

403
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.950
No way!

404
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.870
That's him.

405
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.740
- I'll go.
- Stay!


406
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.870
I want to know what you think.

407
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:00.740
Over here!

408
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.990
What a surprise!
Sorry for stopping you.


409
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.450
Oh, this is my friend, Meiko.
And this is Mr. Kubota.


410
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.570
Sorry, I already told her about you.

411
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.870
Have you decided?

412
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.120
What?

413
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.240
Who's it gonna be, Kazu?

414
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.870
Sorry, Gumi.

415
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.870
I'm his ex-girlfriend.

416
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.740
A terrible coincidence, isn't it?
It's so funny.


417
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:51.240
I went to see
him right after we spoke.

418
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.120
It felt as if the two years
vanished in an instant.


419
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:59.740
It was like magic.

420
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.450
Then, I realized...

421
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.990
I love you, Kazu.

422
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.740
With all my heart,

423
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.620
all I desire is you.

424
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.070
I can't imagine life without you.

425
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:25.990
I realized that your encounter with Gumi
was the magic meant for us.


426
00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.700
You must have realized that, too.

427
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.490
Meet my friend, Meiko.

428
00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.070
And this is Mr. Kubota.

429
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.620
Sorry, I already told her about you.

430
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.370
I'll go.

431
00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.820
Huh? Stay!

432
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.370
C'mon, I know social etiquette.

433
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.990
Will you take care of this?

434
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.870
Nice couple!

435
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.370
Oh, stop.

436
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.240
I got this.

437
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:17.740
Oh, no. Don't...

438
00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.620
Please, let me.
And then we'll go somewhere.


439
00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:25.200
Okay. Where to?

440

Please discuss amongst yourselves.

It looks like harassment.

More so with the door closed.
Please leave it open.

- You still have time.
- You showered.

I got held back a year.
Why would I go?


473

At least you got invited, unlike me.

It's funny though.

- Of course it is.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.870
Really?

488
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.450
Yeah, really.

489
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.120
I'll never have that campus life.

490
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.070
I'm the only one...

491
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.490
who climbed over, so be thankful.

492
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:30.570
To think I drummed the courage
to attend college...


493
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.620
You've got me.

494
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.120
I can find friends
with benefits elsewhere.


495
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.120
That right there.

496
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.120
What?

497
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:48.240
That's why you're
not in the girl's chat.


498
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.120
Girl's chat...?

499
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.620
I heard from Kana. 
She was laughing.

500
00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.320
I thought it was funny too, sorry.

501
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.950
Weird... I think I'm gonna cry.

502
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.370
Go ahead. Cry.

503
00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.990
Seriously?

504
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.740
Professor Segawa won? That's great.

505
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.990
No it isn't.

506
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.490
It's a prestigious award.

507
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.240
<i>I couldn't write twenty plus years,</i>

508
00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:43.450
<i>but I was able to write this novel</i>
<i>without hesitation from start to finish.</i>


509
00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.820
I actually have his book on me now.

510
00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:49.820
You bought it?

511
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.240
I want you to read it.

512
00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.070
Hell no.

513
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.490
<i>Praised for its fresh literary style</i>
<i>and clever story structureâŚ</i>


514
00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.620
I could've presented this news.

515
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.570
<i>So you're his former student?</i>

516
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.240
<i>Yes. It's very humbling.</i>
<i>I know I caused him trouble.</i>


517
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.240
<i>What was he like?</i>

518
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:20.240
<i>Very strict. 
I wasn't the best student.</i>

519
00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:23.370
Hey.

520
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.870
Read this part.

521
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:31.240
Hello?

522
00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:42.370
French is mandatory to graduate,
so it's your own fault.


523
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:48.740
Araki was gonna let me pass just for
showing, but she had to get pregnant.


524
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.370
Geez.

525
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:55.370
- I'm glad you didn't get the job.
- Why?


526
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:56.950
Just because.

527
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.490
Well, no one'll hire me.

528
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.870
Not even local stations.

529
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.490
What the hell? 
He's such a creep.

530
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:19.570
I thought Professor Segawa
was all shriveled up.


531
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.990
But I'm glad, and
it kinda turned me on.

532
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.740
Really?

533
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.620
I just had an idea.

534
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.240
What?

535
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.870
A honeytrap.

536
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.870
Honeytrap the professor?

537
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.570
Yeah. You gotta help me, Nao.

538
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.990
Why?

539
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:56.700
He killed my future,
so I wanna return the favor.


540
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.870
Fair, right?

541
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.200
Nuh-uh. I like him.

542
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.490
Are you serious?

543
00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.120
More than sex with me?

544
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.990
What the heck?

545
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:20.200
No help, no sex. 
This is goodbye.

546
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:21.570
Huh?

547
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.990
I'll ignore you on campus.

548
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.620
- You do that now.
- I'll shut you out.


549
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.490
Poor thing.

550
00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.490
Come on.

551
00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.700
You're the only one I can ask.

552
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.570
I wanna keep doing it with you.

553
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.990
Then no honeytraps.

554
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.200
Our bodies are perfectly compatible.

555
00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.990
So, pretty please.

556
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.740
- I have to go.
- Come on.


557
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.120
Help me feel better.

558
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:21.990
Stop.

559
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.570
Oh, Miss Murayama.

560
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:35.950
You remember me?

561
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.240
Of course. How can I help?

562
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:47.240
Um, congratulations on
the Akutagawa Prize.


563
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:50.620
Thank you.

564
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.870
May I have your autograph?

565
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:57.200
Oh, sure.

566
00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.740
I really enjoyed it.

567
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.490
Thank you. Come in.

568
00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.370
Sorry. Please leave it open.

569
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:14.620
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

570
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.070
That's all right.

571
00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.950
Can you sign right here?

572
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.320
Not the cover?

573
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:41.700
I really love the picture that
you've painted here.


574
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:46.870
Your signature here would
make me happy every time I read it.


575
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.070
Is that okay?

576
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.870
Yes...of course.

577
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.370
Thank you so much.

578
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.370
No, thank you.

579
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:20.370
Wow.

580
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:26.570
I'm really happy that
you won, Professor.


581
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:31.120
I was in your French class
my first and second year.


582
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.370
Yes, I remember.

583
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.370
That was over a year ago...

584
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.120
I'm impressed.

585
00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.740
Well, you stood out.

586
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.200
Right. I'm much older
than everyone else.


587
00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.370
No, not for that reason.

588
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.570
You asked many questions
during and after class.


589
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.240
Yes, that's me.

590
00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:02.820
I especially enjoyed your classes.

591
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.950
You're very thorough,
and your French is beautiful.


592
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:07.870
Not at all.

593
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:16.700
Um, if you have time,
and you don't mind...


594
00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:18.240
Yes?

595
00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:22.990
May I ask you questions
about your book?


596
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.370
Oh, sure.

597
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.240
Are you busy now?

598
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.490
No, I'm free.

599
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:38.490
- Would you like to go to a cafe?
- No, here is fine.


600
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:40.120
I'll pour us tea.

601
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.490
- You don't have to.
- It's all right.


602
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.370
Please sit.

603
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:51.990
So what year are you now?

604
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.700
Fourth. Time really does fly.

605
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.240
Do you have a job lined up?

606
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:01.370
Not exactly.

607
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:06.990
- I'll just be a housewife again.
- So you're married?


608
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.240
Yes. I have a daughter too.

609
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.240
Going back to school
must've been difficult.


610
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.620
I wanted to study psychology.

611
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.370
Here you go.
It's quite humid.


612
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.820
Thank you.

613
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:31.370
Grad school is out of the question,
so I won't be able to finish.


614
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.320
I see.

615
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:38.120
Enough about me.
I want to hear about you.


616
00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:43.870
- But I don't know what to ask...
- Anything.


617
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.820
Do you have a family?
Are you married?


618
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:55.240
No, I'm single.

619
00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:00.620
I'm sorry. You meant
anything about your book.


620
00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.820
I did think of questions.

621
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:11.490
About the scene
on this page you autographed...


622
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.620
It's very fascinating.

623
00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:25.950
"I held myself upright
with the back of my hand"


624
00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:31.070
"so that it wouldn't get in the way
while she shaved me."


625
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:38.320
"She treated my testicles like
a little bird with a broken wing."


626
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:46.370
"She had little interest in my penis
and only occasionally supported it"


627
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:50.200
"with the back of her hand
as she shaved."


628
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:54.490
"My penis gradually stiffened."

629
00:51:55.370 --> 00:52:00.950
"But she kept sliding the razor
at a constant speed"


630
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.620
"over the tight skin of my testicles."

631
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.370
"After shaving,"

632
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:15.370
"she gently washed off the shaving cream
with a towel seeped in lukewarm water."


633
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:19.200
"Not to leave any hairs behind,"

634
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.870
"she carefully went between
my testicles and the metal wash basin."


635
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:36.370
"After the last wipe, when nothing stood
between her and my smooth testicles,"


636
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:40.450
"she smiled proudly for the first time."

637
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:47.990
"Then she opened her mouth to the extent
her craftsmanship wasn't undermined,"


638
00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:52.570
"and placed my right testicle
in her mouth."


639
00:52:56.370 --> 00:53:02.240
"My penis was so stiff that it
no longer needed to be supported,"


640
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:07.620
"but she turned her palm
and gently held it up."


641
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:12.990
"I felt nothing but her courtesy"

642
00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:18.570
"so nothing would interfere while
she had my testicle in her mouth."


643
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.570
"Just as a carpenter measures
a bolt with a caliper,"


644
00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:31.700
"she tried to match the size
of her mouth and my testicle."


645
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:37.490
"Every time she opened her mouth wide,"

646
00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:45.490
"I hoped my testicle would
expand enough to fill the gaps."


647
00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:46.990
Pardon me.

648
00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:19.570
"Other than to wipe her drool,
she focused on measuring"


649
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:27.200
"the size of my right testicle as she
moved her chin and tongue up and down."


650
00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.320
"Seeing her simply work,"

651
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:39.240
"I felt utterly embarrassed
of my stiff penis."


652
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:45.320
"My humiliation and its hardness
were proportionate,"


653
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:49.120
"and the shame turned into aching pain."

654
00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:58.820
"The moment she inhaled a particularly
big breath with drool, I ejaculated."


655
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:03.370
"She let go of my right testicle."

656
00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:07.700
"While holding my withering penis
in her left hand,"


657
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:13.870
"she said, 'I'm sorry.'
without taking a single look at me."


658
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.240
"She slowly opened her mouth again,"

659
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:22.490
"swallowed my left testicle,
and began measuring."


660
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.740
"With my penis still withered,
I ejaculated once more."


661
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.990
"Before she could apologize,"

662
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:38.320
"I knelt and touched the floor
with my forehead."


663
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:43.820
"Tears welled. 
I continued to tremble."

664
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:48.070
"I let my fluids flow for a while."

665
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:57.870
Professor...

666
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:00.370
Yes?

667
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:04.990
What makes you write like this?

668
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:07.740
What...

669
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:14.450
The answer is complex.

670
00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:16.990
Complex?

671
00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.870
First is story structure.

672
00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:25.240
Simply put, it appeals to
a certain type of readers.


673
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.870
Having this appear in the middle,

674
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:34.450
I figured readers would want to
continue reading until the end.


675
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.570
One judge strongly rejected my book.

676
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:43.870
She said this scene
cheapened the novel greatly.


677
00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.950
Perhaps it's true.

678
00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:50.370
I liked this scene.

679
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:55.740
I got the impression that
you enjoyed writing this part.


680
00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.320
Perhaps.

681
00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:04.200
However, it's what the words wanted,
rather than what I wanted.


682
00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.620
The words?

683
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:08.870
That's my other reason.

684
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:14.120
Their arrangement is determined by
their relationship.


685
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:19.320
Words ask for words,
which is different from what I ask for.


686
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:24.620
If the resulting sequence of words
is correct by my standards,


687
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:26.240
I leave them as is.

688
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:31.370
Were you erect as you wrote this?

689
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:36.490
Perhaps...

690
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:40.490
I thought so.

691
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:48.490
I think I must be.
That's what the scene should evoke.


692
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:50.870
Of course.

693
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:11.490
I was happy to read this excerpt.

694
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:13.950
How so?

695
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.620
I'm weak when it comes to sex.

696
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.740
You are?

697
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:22.740
Yes.

698
00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:27.990
I often lose to sexual temptation.

699
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:30.620
- Often?
- Yes.


700
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:35.240
I can't refuse men I feel attracted to.

701
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.620
I'm in a few relationships now.

702
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:52.450
What I wanted to say is that maybe
you have the same weakness.


703
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.990
Like giving into sexual temptation?

704
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:58.620
Yes.

705
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:02.120
Well, perhaps.

706
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:08.450
To write a novel, you also need to
make the most of your weaknesses.


707
00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.450
Have you ever given in?

708
00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:20.740
My life is quite boring.
I've never encountered any temptations.


709
00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.450
If I had, I would've
immediately tripped.


710
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:30.120
Can someone who's lived
a boring life write a novel?


711
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:37.620
I merely maximize
what can be expressed in words.


712
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:40.620
There's no room for my experiences.

713
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:45.490
The words resonate with
the reader's experience.


714
00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.570
For example, your experience.

715
00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.320
My experience?

716
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:57.200
Pardon my intrusiveness,

717
00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.370
but you said sex is your weakness.

718
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:02.700
Yes.

719
01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:05.990
Are you concerned about that?

720
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:12.620
If you are, perhaps you should be
speaking to a counselor, not me.


721
01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:21.490
I'm scared that my husband
may find out some day.


722
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.120
But personality-wise,
I'm not too worried


723
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:29.120
since I'm not addicted to it.

724
01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:35.990
I just feel I simply need
slightly stronger will power.


725
01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:41.120
To me, you seem to have
a very strong will power,


726
01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.450
compared to other students.

727
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:47.370
Thank you.

728
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.570
- I am much older.
- No.


729
01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.120
It's not about age, it's about talent.

730
01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.490
What sort of talent would that be?

731
01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:06.120
Your ability to be indescribable
and remain undefined.


732
01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.320
Simply put, you can think and act
without being bound by common sense.


733
01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.870
That's very difficult,
especially in Japanese society.


734
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:23.570
It's not that big of a deal.

735
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.490
My libido is just stronger than others,
or my self-control is weaker.


736
01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.990
I don't fit well with
other people's standards.


737
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.700
That's what I'm saying.
I think it's wonderful.


738
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.200
Is it?

739
01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:47.950
I've never thought
I was better than others in any way.


740
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.320
I think that's also
a sign of your intelligence.


741
01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.070
You're amazing, Professor.

742
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:01.120
How so?

743
01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.570
Nobody's ever been this sure about me.

744
01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.620
Is that so?

745
01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:13.370
But I disagree. I'm a fool.

746
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:18.870
If so, please persuade me
because I don't think so.


747
01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:26.240
That'll take a while since
I'd have to start with my childhood.


748
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:30.070
You'd probably tell me to
see a counselor again.


749
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.070
I apologize for my rudeness.

750
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:38.120
However, counseling is not a bad thing.

751
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:39.990
I agree.

752
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:43.870
I should go one day.

753
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:52.820
I think this is all I need
to prove my foolishness.


754
01:02:54.780 --> 01:03:01.620
Did you know that I was trying
to tempt you this entire time?


755
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.620
No, it never crossed my mind.

756
01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.570
Then what did you think was happening?

757
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.570
I just thought you were very strange.

758
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:23.740
To be honest, I was a little scared.

759
01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.620
I'd be scared too.

760
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:34.740
I think I was wary because
I didn't understand your behavior.


761
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:39.820
I was trying to seduce you.

762
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.990
My aim was to elicit
statements and actions


763
01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.070
that would lead you to seduce me.

764
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.120
What for?

765
01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:55.240
To record it and
sell it to the media.

766
01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:01.370
Are you recording now?

767
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.740
- Yes, I'll stop...
- The whole time?


768
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.740
While you read aloud?

769
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.240
Yes, it was recording.

770
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:20.120
Unbelievable...

771
01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:37.740
- I'm sorry.
- Please listen.


772
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:42.450
I hope you don't misunderstand me.

773
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.370
May I have the data?

774
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.490
While listening,
I wished I was recording it


775
01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.820
because this may never happen again.

776
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.450
But you had been.

777
01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:10.120
I'mâŚexcited.

778
01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.070
I'm sure this is awkward for you.

779
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:19.070
The part you read
can also be misleading.


780
01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:25.240
Having someone with such
a beautiful voice read my writing


781
01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:27.450
was exhilarating.

782
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:29.570
I never knew.

783
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:34.990
You'll have many opportunities
in the future.


784
01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:38.990
No, it's your voice that was incredible.

785
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.870
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.


786
01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:54.620
Don't you...want to know why
I tried to trap you?


787
01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.740
Isn't it because you dislike me?

788
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:05.370
No. I've no reason to dislike you.

789
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:09.620
You may be disliked
just for being you.


790
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:17.990
But I can't change who I am.

791
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:24.870
In that case, what should I do...

792
01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:30.870
if I'm hated for just being me.

793
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:33.740
I don't know.

794
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:39.490
If who I am,
something I can't change,


795
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:45.820
makes people nauseous, what am I to do?

796
01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.370
I don't know what happened in your life.

797
01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:11.490
But if people around you made you think
you're worthless, please fight back.


798
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:17.120
Refuse when society's ruler
tries to measure you.


799
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:23.370
You must embrace your own value
that only you know.


800
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:30.740
It's very painful to do it alone.
Still, you must do it.


801
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:36.370
Because only those who do
can unexpectedly connect with


802
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:38.320
and encourage somebody.

803
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.740
It may never happen,

804
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:47.870
but if nobody does it,
it won't ever happen.


805
01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.450
Not anyone can.

806
01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:01.240
You were talented enough
to be recognized by society.


807
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.700
That's why you can say that.

808
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:08.740
True.

809
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:17.240
I wish we had been able to
talk like this before the prize.


810
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:23.570
But if I didn't win,
we wouldn't be here.


811
01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:27.620
You're right.

812
01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:35.450
I'm sorry. I should've
read your book sooner.


813
01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:39.450
There are many other books
you should be reading.


814
01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:44.120
I haven't read much else.

815
01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:47.870
That makes me envious.

816
01:08:56.530 --> 01:09:00.490
How shall I send you the data?

817
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.870
Can you e-mail it?

818
01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:06.240
Yes, I'm sure I can.

819
01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:11.240
Please send it to "segawa"
with the university domain.


820
01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.990
Okay.

821
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.740
When you receive the data,
do you plan on doing anything peculiar?


822
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:24.120
Peculiar?

823
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:29.990
- I mean masturbate.
- No, I don't think so.


824
01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:33.870
Then I can't give it to you.

825
01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.240
If you want the data,
you have to promise me


826
01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:46.740
that you'll masturbate to my voice
at least one time.


827
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.490
Then you can have it.

828
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:58.490
I understand. I promise to masturbate
at least once to your voice.


829
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.870
Okay, I'll send it.

830
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:04.950
Thank you.

831
01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.320
Would you mind if
I think of you too?

832
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:14.370
Please feel free.

833
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:28.820
If you like, I'll send you a recording
of me reading from start to finish.


834
01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:30.870
You'll do that?

835
01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:39.370
I'm happy that somebody likes my voice,
and that somebody's you.


836
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:41.240
It won't be easy.

837
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.240
It'll be my pleasure.

838
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:46.620
Thank you very much.

839
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.990
Thank you.

840
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.120
I appreciate it.

841
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.740
The door...?

842
01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.700
Please leave it open.

843
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.570
Goodbye.

844

<i>Dear Professor Segawa,</i>

849
01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:00.740
Too heavy...

850
01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:14.070
<i>Thank you for today.</i>
<i>It was fun.</i>


851
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.370
<i>Here is the audio file.</i>
<i>Don't forget the promise.</i>


852
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.990
- We're home.
- Welcome back.


853
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:30.870
- I thought you went out.
- Huh? Oh, my plans changed.


854
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:33.620
Sagawa Express left a delivery note.

855
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.240
Really?

856
01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:38.240
- Yamato.
- Thank you! Yamato?


857
01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:41.320
It's "Sagawa," not Yamato.

858
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.320
Sagawa...Sagawa...

859
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:44.950
That's right.

860
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.570
We're out of groceries,
so let's eat out.


861
01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.820
Okay, well, what do you want to eat?

862
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.990
<i>To: sagawa@toko-univ.ac.jp</i>

863
01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.700
You can do it! Oh, good job!

864
01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.870
Very good.

865
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:15.450
<i>Five years later...</i>

866
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.320
No way!

867
01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.870
You haven't changed a bit.

868
01:13:57.910 --> 01:14:00.370
- Really?
- Yeah, really.


869
01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.490
Oh, man. Why are you here?

870
01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.370
I feel like you've changed.

871
01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:09.950
Well, yeah. How long has it been?

872
01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.620
What are you up to?

873
01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:16.070
- I work as a proofreader.
- No way.


874
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:20.240
My company just got rid of
our proofreading department.


875
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:24.740
What do you do now?

876
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:28.120
Publishing. I'm an editor.

877
01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:32.120
I'm in charge of literature.
Hilarious, right?


878
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:35.570
Give me your business card.

879
01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.990
Why?

880
01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.490
We're gonna be outsourcing
our proofreading.


881
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:48.870
- I don't have any on me.
- What's your company called?


882
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:50.200
It's a secret.

883
01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.570
Woah.

884
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:53.990
What?

885
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:56.240
Are you mad at me?

886
01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.570
You don't even read novels.

887
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:10.070
Well, I will now, but I think
that's what makes me unique.


888
01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:14.320
It's probably why they gave me the job.

889
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:17.870
Being all scholarly is boring.

890
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:19.740
- It doesn't sell.
- Sorry.


891
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.870
Can you please shut up?

892
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:42.870
You know, it's not all my fault
Segawa quit and you got a divorce.


893
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.240
You're barking up the wrong tree.

894
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:50.990
I know.

895
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:53.870
It was priceless, though,

896
01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.740
when admin got your
sexy e-mail by mistake.


897
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.240
- Segawa and Sagawa...
- Stop.


898
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.620
I can't believe you mixed up the two.

899
01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.990
It's still funny.

900
01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.950
I can't believe it either.

901
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:19.370
Well, Nao,
I feel bad I had you do all that.


902
01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:21.740
But I'm hella grateful.

903
01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.240
My own stupidity makes me wanna cry.

904
01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:33.490
We don't hear about him anymore.
I wonder what he's up to?


905
01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.490
I don't know.

906
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:37.450
Is he even alive?

907
01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:51.200
- You can ask him to write a book.
- Nope. He disappeared pretty much.


908
01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:54.990
You can get leads from
other editors, can't you?


909
01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.870
Why would I?

910
01:16:57.410 --> 01:17:02.120
Someday, you can edit his work,

911
01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:07.450
and I can proofread it.

912
01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.240
No way.

913
01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.870
- Wouldn't that be nice?
- Not in the least.

Yeah.

917
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.570
I'm getting married, Nao.

918
01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.120
Oh.

919
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.370
- No "congratulations"?
- Congrats.


920
01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:44.740
Thanks.

921
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:48.120
Tell me about her.

922
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:54.870
She's a coworker, two years older,
wants marriage before thirty.

- My card.

Weird, right?

You got soft.

Yup, I got soft and ordinary.

962
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.450

966
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:31.370
- You're leaving?
- Huh?


967
01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.370
Yeah. Thanks.

968
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:36.070
- Bye.
- Bye.


969
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.200
See you.

970
01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.620
<i>Pork Cutlet Bowls</i>

971
01:23:34.530 --> 01:23:35.490
Mister.

972
01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:36.870
Yes?

973
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:38.120
It's delicious!

974
01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.820
Thank you.

975
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:46.200
I used to come here when
I was in high school, remember?


976
01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:48.740
Sorry, I have bad memory.

977
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:50.490
It's okay.

978
01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:52.200
This is so good.

979
01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:53.570
I'm grateful.

980
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.620
- Come again soon.
- I will!


981
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:26.950
<i>Sendai Station</i>

982
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.990
Wait upstairs.

983
01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.990
Should I come down?

984
01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.320
Wait upstairs!

985
01:24:58.530 --> 01:24:59.620
Got it.

986
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.120
- What a surprise!
- Yeah.


987
01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.620
Unbelievable!

988
01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.120
Why are you here?

989
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.240
For the reunion.

990
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:25.740
High school reunion?

991
01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:29.240
- I didn't know about it.
- Really?


992
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.990
I bet it's 'cause my surname
and address changed.


993
01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:36.740
Yeah, but I got to meet you.

994
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:38.620
Right. I'm glad.

995
01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.200
Still live in Tokyo?

996
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:43.120
Yeah.

997
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:45.200
- Heading back?
- Yeah.


998
01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:48.320
Do you have time?

999
01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:51.740
- Oh...
- Can we go for tea?


1000
01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.870
It's a silly reason to ruin
this dramatic meeting...


1001
01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:02.990
But I need to be home for a delivery
between 2 and 4 PM.


1002
01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.120
Oh, I see.

1003
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.990
I'm not saying "no."
Come home with me.


1004
01:26:08.410 --> 01:26:11.370
If you have time, that is.
Let's have tea.


1005
01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.370
I have time,
but is it really okay?


1006
01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:17.570
Of course.
Nobody's home during the day.


1007
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.620
Sound good?

1008
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:19.820
Sure.

1009
01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.870
It's a 15-minute walk, near Kadan.

1010
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:25.490
That's a nice place.

1011
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:27.620
It is convenient.

1012
01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.870
Who were at the reunion?

1013
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:40.370
I couldn't tell who was who.

1014
01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:44.120
It's been 20 years,
and their last names changed.


1015
01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.370
Right.

1016
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:48.450
I couldn't keep up the chitchat.

1017
01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.240
Bet they didn't recognize me, too.

1018
01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:54.950
You must think I had no friends.

1019
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.370
No, I don't.

1020
01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:59.370
Then I guess it
was all in my head.

1021
01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:04.990
But I did talk with Kiyomiya
from the art club.


1022
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.570
Kiyomiya?

1023
01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.370
Don't remember.

1024
01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:11.240
She's a school art teacher now.

1025
01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:12.740
Oh, really.

1026
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:16.320
She said she had wanted me
to model for her.


1027
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:17.740
A nude model?

1028
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:19.320
No way!

1029
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:21.740
I'm not sure, though.

1030
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:23.620
You were cool back then.

1031
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:26.990
Kiyomiya said I hadn't changed a bit.

1032
01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.740
That can't be true.

1033
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:31.820
Maybe so. We both changed.

1034
01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.240
What do you do?

1035
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:39.450
I'm a systems engineer. IT laborer.

1036
01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.990
So it means...

1037
01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.450
- Yup, I'm out of a job now.
- That's too bad.


1038
01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:50.570
But I have savings, and IT workers
get extra unemployment benefits.


1039
01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:53.070
I'll just take it as a break.

1040
01:27:53.530 --> 01:27:54.620
That's good.

1041
01:27:56.490 --> 01:27:57.870
Hello.

1042
01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.450
- Hot, isn't it?
- It is.


1043
01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:03.570
- Yu had fun at your home.
- I'm glad.


1044
01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:06.740
Hitomi can come play anytime, too.

1045
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.450
Thanks, she'd love that.

1046
01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.240
- Good day.
- Good day.


1047
01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.820
It's kind of surreal.

1048
01:28:18.990 --> 01:28:19.950
Is it?

1049
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.490
How old's your kid?

1050
01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:24.990
I've got a son who's 16,
and a daughter who's14.


1051
01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.870
- Really.
- Yup.


1052
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:29.450
- Incredible.
- It's not.


1053
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:31.320
Here we are.

1054
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:33.620
Wow.

1055
01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:44.740
"Kobayashi."

1056
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:53.870
Come in.

1057
01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:03.450
Put your bag anywhere.

1058
01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.870
Your partner...

1059
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:10.490
What's his job?

1060
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:14.370
He's an R&D in a pharmaceutical company.

1061
01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.740
Makes sense.

1062
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:17.990
- What does?
- Nothing.


1063
01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.700
Any affects?

1064
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.620
Of the virus?

1065
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:27.320
His research data got leaked,
but so did other companies.


1066
01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.570
All he needs for work is the
microscope, so we're fine.


1067
01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:33.740
I see.

1068
01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:36.070
What'd you do today?

1069
01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:39.740
- I had a tea class.
- Really?


1070
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.740
What?

1071
01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:46.870
Sort of unexpected, but I bet
you're cut out for tea ceremonies.


1072
01:29:47.530 --> 01:29:48.570
Thanks.

1073
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:51.370
But I'm making normal tea for now.

1074
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:53.490
I'm fine with it.

1075
01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.490
Want sweet bean jelly? I froze it.

1076
01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:01.240
- It's top-notch.
- You don't mind?


1077
01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:04.620
My family doesn't like it as I do.

1078
01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:06.120
What a waste.

1079
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:09.070
Can I help?

1080
01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.240
It's okay. Just relax.

1081
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:20.320
- Don't touch it!
- Sorry.


1082
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.870
I'm sorry.

1083
01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.950
Is your kid a fan?

1084
01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.700
Yeah, my son is.

1085
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:28.950
I see.

1086
01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.620
I'm embarrassed.

1087
01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.740
But anime these days are intriguing.

1088
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:36.740
Today's package is
a Blu-ray for an anime.


1089
01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:41.370
Because all the VOD services
don't work anymore.


1090
01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:44.740
I missed the package two days ago.

1091
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:47.570
My son gets cranky, you know?

1092
01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:49.200
Do you watch it too?

1093
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:51.200
No. Do you?

1094
01:30:51.370 --> 01:30:53.990
I binge watch to kill time now.

1095
01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:00.370
I don't get it anymore.
Can't keep up with the conversation.


1096
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:03.620
- You can, if you watch it.
- Maybe.


1097
01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.990
But I'm not interested.

1098
01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:11.240
I don't mind what people like,
but I'm not interested.


1099
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:23.620
It's my mother-in-law's.

1100
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:25.740
Oh, really.

1101
01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.620
You still play the piano?

1102
01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:31.200
Huh?

1103
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:32.620
Not at all.

1104
01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:34.700
I see.

1105
01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:38.700
I only play for
my daughter's violin, too.


1106
01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:44.490
You seem to be scared of silence.

1107
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:45.870
Do I?

1108
01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:52.120
You keep avoiding what's important.
Even though it's been 20 years.


1109
01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.870
What's important?

1110
01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.950
Are you happy right now?

1111
01:31:58.780 --> 01:31:59.740
Oh...

1112
01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:05.240
It sounds silly to ask
after seeing this house.


1113
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:08.490
But that's my only question.

1114
01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:12.990
I haven't thought about it.

1115
01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.990
You shouldn't have to think.

1116
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:22.990
I can't say.

1117
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.740
I do my best
to get by every day.

1118
01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:44.990
There were hard times,
but I wasn't miserable.


1119
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:49.570
Objectively speaking,
I must be very happy.


1120
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:56.820
I feel I'd get scolded
if I say I'm not happy.


1121
01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:00.240
I'm asking what you think.

1122
01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:03.870
I don't know...

1123
01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:12.740
Are you happy?

1124
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:15.700
I'm not.

1125
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:18.490
Why? Because of your job?

1126
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:19.820
No.

1127
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:27.700
Because I've been regretting
not fighting for my feelings.


1128
01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:33.240
I shouldn't have given up,
even if the result was the same.


1129
01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.700
But I was ignorant then.

1130
01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.490
I was scared to be hurt more.

1131
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.870
That's why I came here to see you.

1132
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.950
Hold on.

1133
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:53.120
Let me clarify 'cause this conversation
seems important to you.


1134
01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:54.490
What?

1135
01:33:55.910 --> 01:34:00.950
To be honest,
I can't remember your name.


1136
01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.200
Are you serious?

1137
01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:09.200
I'm sorry. I hoped I'd recall,
or you'd say it as we talked.


1138
01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.620
How could you forget?

1139
01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:15.320
Then it made me wonder.

1140
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:16.820
What?

1141
01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:19.820
Do you know my name?

1142
01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:21.990
Of course, I do.

1143
01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.200
Then who am I?

1144
01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:27.990
Mika Yuki.

1145
01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.120
Oh...

1146
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:31.990
Aya Kobayashi.

1147
01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:37.870
My name's Aya Kobayashi.

1148
01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:46.490
My maiden name's Nomura.
I'm not Mika Yuki either way.


1149
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:49.700
- You're not Mika?
- No.


1150
01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.740
I'm Aya Kobayashi,
and not your classmate.


1151
01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.490
You got the wrong person.

1152
01:34:57.410 --> 01:35:01.620
But...you remembered me.

1153
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:03.820
Well...

1154
01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:10.200
We met on the escalator, right?

1155
01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:11.490
Yeah.

1156
01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:18.990
When we passed each other,
you looked at me all surprised.


1157
01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:25.200
So I thought you
must be someone I know.

1158
01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:31.070
When I went back up, you came down,
and I panicked.


1159
01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:35.240
I was trying hard to recollect.
Then it hit me.


1160
01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.200
"She's my classmate
that went to Tokyo for college."


1161
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:43.370
Doesn't that mean you know me?

1162
01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.370
Where's your school?

1163
01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.370
Miyagi Girls' High.

1164
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:49.620
I went to Sendai High.

1165
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:58.870
See? I'm sorry, it was my mistake.

1166
01:35:59.530 --> 01:36:01.990
I mean, <i>our</i> mistake.

1167
01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.370
I don't believe this...

1168
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:10.950
You must've wanted to see her badly.

1169
01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.700
Yes, that's right.

1170
01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.450
I missed her so much.

1171
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:27.240
That must be why you mistook me,
with similar age, for Mika.


1172
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:31.620
That can't be.

1173
01:36:32.530 --> 01:36:34.950
But you haven't seen her 20 years.

1174
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:41.450
Did you keep in touch?

1175
01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:43.570
No.

1176
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:48.240
Cause I heard
she married after college.


1177
01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:54.570
Could it be that
you and Mika were lovers?


1178
01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.120
I'm sorry.

1179
01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:11.950
Whoa, excuse me.

1180
01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.120
I brought your package.

1181
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:16.990
Thank you.

1182
01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.370
Please sign here.

1183
01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:20.570
Sure.

1184
01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.870
<i>Kobayashi</i>

1185
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.570
- Here you go.
- Thank you.


1186
01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.240
Why don't you stay longer?

1187
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:46.370
The sweet bean jelly and kettle's ready.

1188
01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.620
It's like a sweet bean popsicle!

1189
01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.620
Right?

1190
01:38:41.530 --> 01:38:43.450
A high-grade version.

1191
01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.490
Are you sure you're not Mika?

1192
01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.620
I'm not Mika. Sorry.

1193
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:57.620
Ugh.

1194
01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:05.950
Was Mika your first love?

1195
01:39:08.370 --> 01:39:10.320
I'm not sure about that.

1196
01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:13.490
But she was my first partner.

1197
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:20.240
We dated at the end of high school

1198
01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:24.120
and did long-distance
after I moved to Tokyo.


1199
01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:26.990
Then, she got a boyfriend.

1200
01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:28.240
Oh...

1201
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:33.370
She wasn't like me,
so I should've seen it coming.


1202
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:36.490
But I was oblivious somehow.

1203
01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:40.990
You mean, only you
were a genuine lesbian?


1204
01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.240
Genuine?

1205
01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:44.320
Yeah.

1206
01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:51.490
We were planning to live together
in Tokyo after college.


1207
01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:55.870
But broke up when she cheated...
I mean, changed.


1208
01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.620
I see.

1209
01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.990
Never saw her again?

1210
01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.370
Yeah. Afterward, someone
told me she married the guy.


1211
01:40:05.530 --> 01:40:07.450
Did you love her?

1212
01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.240
My husband...

1213
01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.950
He was contacting his high school ex.

1214
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.120
Really?

1215
01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.370
I found out because the virus
sent his emails to me.


1216
01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:40.240
You know, you can see
the history of their responses.


1217
01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:41.240
Yeah.

1218
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:49.740
He wrote in the email, "I really
want to see you, but we shouldn't."


1219
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:53.990
"I know we love our families."

1220
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:55.490
He's faithful.

1221
01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:57.450
He is.

1222
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:59.320
How did you feel?

1223
01:41:02.370 --> 01:41:06.240
It's hard to put it into words.

1224
01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:10.200
But it was beautifully written.

1225
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:13.870
I was surprised by his words.

1226
01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.240
What words?

1227
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:27.240
"The things you said to me
keeps me going even now."


1228
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:35.740
"Your existence is my anchor,
even to this day."


1229
01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:43.700
"Meeting you was one of the best things
that has ever happened in my life."


1230
01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.490
Wow.

1231
01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:48.740
I kept rereading it.

1232
01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:53.490
But isn't there only one "best thing"?

1233
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:56.740
Yeah, it's a weird expression.

1234
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:59.570
Did you tell him you read it?

1235
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.990
No.

1236
01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.870
Did your partner...
I mean, Mr. Husband notice?


1237
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:06.200
"Mr. Husband"?

1238
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:11.950
I'm not sure.
I think he was too busy back then.


1239
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:16.450
Almost everything was leaked.

1240
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:20.320
I bet he couldn't tell what got exposed.

1241
01:42:22.410 --> 01:42:23.870
Not gonna tell him?

1242
01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:28.870
It'll only make things awkward.

1243
01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.870
He did contact her, after all.

1244
01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.950
And wanted to see her.

1245
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:40.740
Can't forgive him?

1246
01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.240
For just the thought?

1247
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:55.370
I think you can't stop
wanting to see someone.


1248
01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:58.620
You don't have to be so understanding.

1249
01:43:02.410 --> 01:43:05.950
Sorry. I don't even know you.

1250
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:08.870
It's okay.

1251
01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.070
Do I look understanding?

1252
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:22.740
What's wrong?

1253
01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.820
I keep seeing Mika in you.

1254
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.370
Do I resemble her that much?

1255
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:32.740
Maybe it's the vibe you give off.

1256
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:38.240
You look exactly like
what I imagined she'd look now.


1257
01:43:38.490 --> 01:43:40.870
Was Mika understanding?

1258
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:42.120
Not at all.

1259
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:48.070
She looks it,
but you can't reason with her.


1260
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:50.450
Maybe she's really like me.

1261
01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.120
I can play Mika if you'd like.

1262
01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:02.740
Play her?

1263
01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:07.370
It seems like a waste.

1264
01:44:07.530 --> 01:44:08.620
Of what?

1265
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:10.740
The dramatic meeting.

1266
01:44:11.490 --> 01:44:12.950
What do you mean?

1267
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.740
My looks and personality seem to fit.

1268
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:19.490
- That's not the point.
- I may not be good enough.


1269
01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:26.370
But I know it's something
that means a lot to you.


1270
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:36.450
I know it's late,
but can I ask your name?


1271
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:42.320
Natsuko Higuchi.

1272
01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:45.620
Natsuko means "summer child."

1273
01:44:46.530 --> 01:44:47.490
Natsuko.

1274
01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:49.370
Lovely name.

1275
01:45:00.370 --> 01:45:01.490
Natsuko...

1276
01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:04.990
You said you weren't happy.

1277
01:45:06.490 --> 01:45:09.740
Is it my fault?

1278
01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.820
Stop it...

1279
01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:17.740
You didn't date anyone after me?

1280
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.820
There were some.

1281
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:24.070
But I couldn't truly connect.

1282
01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:26.870
Were you truly connected with me?

1283
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:32.990
Are you mad?

1284
01:45:35.370 --> 01:45:36.120
Yeah.

1285
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.870
I'm mad.

1286
01:45:44.530 --> 01:45:45.700
I'm sorry.

1287
01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.450
Don't be.

1288
01:45:50.490 --> 01:45:51.870
It's not you.

1289
01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:56.370
I'm mad I didn't say
the things I should've.


1290
01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.240
Like what?

1291
01:46:01.410 --> 01:46:02.820
What I couldn't say.

1292
01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:10.740
When you gave me your last call,
I was at Shibuya Center-gai.


1293
01:46:11.530 --> 01:46:16.870
The trending song and
deeply tanned girls were real noisy.


1294
01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:23.990
But I could hear your voice clearly.

1295
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:27.740
You sounded determined.

1296
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:34.240
I sensed you had suffered enough
before you made the call.


1297
01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:38.490
So, I couldn't say anything.

1298
01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:44.320
I knew if I did, it would only
make you suffer more.


1299
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:50.370
That's why I hung up
and never called again.


1300
01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:55.070
But I wanted to say was

1301
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:59.620
you're my one and only love.

1302
01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.070
You may be able to love someone else,

1303
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:11.120
but I can't love anyone else.

1304
01:47:14.530 --> 01:47:20.120
Being together with me
may complicate your life.


1305
01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.820
But I wanted you to choose me.

1306
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:26.740
I couldn't say that.

1307
01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:28.990
I see.

1308
01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:36.490
But I didn't come here because
I wanted something from you.


1309
01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:42.620
I just wanted to tell you
that I couldn't say those words.


1310
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:47.450
Even if it made you suffer,
I should've said it.


1311
01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.070
I know now, the pain
was essential for our lives.


1312
01:47:54.280 --> 01:48:01.240
I assumed you'd have a hole
in your life now, just like me.


1313
01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:03.570
So I came.

1314
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.240
A hole?

1315
01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:12.990
You must have a hole
that nothing can fill in.


1316
01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:19.370
There's no way for me to fill it.

1317
01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:23.490
But I have the same hole as you.

1318
01:48:24.490 --> 01:48:30.070
We may be still connected
through that hole.


1319
01:48:31.410 --> 01:48:33.240
I came to tell you that.

1320
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:46.570
I'm home.

1321
01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:53.990
Is it here?

1322
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:04.070
Say hello.

1323
01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:05.950
Hello.

1324
01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:08.070
Nice to meet you.

1325
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:19.700
He's handsome.

1326
01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.870
I thought he'd be a geek.

1327
01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:28.490
He can't even say hello.

1328
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:33.320
I should be going.

1329
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:36.120
It's okay. He won't come down.

1330
01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.620
Your daughter will be back. I'm going.

1331
01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:43.620
Okay. Can I walk you to the station?

1332
01:49:44.370 --> 01:49:46.620
Yeah. Thanks.

1333
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:55.450
Kei, I'm going to walk
my friend to the station.


1334
01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.740
So your son's name is Kei.

1335
01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:12.950
Yeah.

1336
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:14.740
And the girl's Yu.

1337
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.740
Right.

1338
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:17.990
How'd you know?

1339
01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.870
You mentioned it.

1340
01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.320
Oh, yeah.

1341
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:24.200
Yu means "to play."

1342
01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:26.200
Nice, simple names.

1343
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:32.870
We wanted gender-neutral names
so it wouldn't shackle them later.


1344
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:34.620
You're progressive.

1345
01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:37.620
What's Mr. Husband like?

1346
01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:43.490
He's a steady, diligent person.

1347
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:45.990
That might be the best.

1348
01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.120
- You think so?
- Well, I don't know him.


1349
01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.490
But I felt trust and a little distance
from your tone.


1350
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:55.990
You're right.

1351
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:59.490
- But you missed "love."
- Sorry.


1352
01:50:59.910 --> 01:51:00.820
It's okay.

1353
01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:04.490
I've never told anyone before.

1354
01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.370
I'm honored.

1355
01:51:07.410 --> 01:51:08.700
I'm amazed.

1356
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:19.700
What is it?

1357
01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:23.370
Who did you mistake me for?

1358
01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:28.370
She was my high school classmate.
A boyish girl.


1359
01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:30.320
Were you two close?

1360
01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:34.620
Not really. We weren't that close.

1361
01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:40.370
She often played the piano
alone at lunch break.


1362
01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:44.490
I also played the piano as a hobby.

1363
01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:48.740
So we started meeting
in the music room at lunch.


1364
01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:54.120
We took turns playing the piano
during lunch break


1365
01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:57.740
and ate listening to each other's piano.

1366
01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:03.120
We didn't talk in class.
Only in the music room.


1367
01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:05.570
- What a lovely memory.
- Yeah.


1368
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:07.820
It was sort of special.

1369
01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:11.620
We lost contact after she went to Tokyo.

1370
01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:22.120
<i>Sendai Station</i>

1371
01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:24.620
Hey.

1372
01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.370
Let's play pretend again.

1373
01:52:29.370 --> 01:52:30.950
Where should we start?

1374
01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:35.450
I'll be your boyish pianist this time.

1375
01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:37.370
But my memory's hazy.

1376
01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:39.990
- It seems unfair.
- Why?


1377
01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.200
Let me do it!

1378
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:45.240
All right. You walk from there.

1379
01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:48.950
We meet when I come up
the escalator, okay?


1380
01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:50.240
It's like a skit.

1381
01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:29.490
Aya?

1382
01:53:31.410 --> 01:53:32.620
Is it you?

1383
01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:36.820
Do you recognize me?

1384
01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:39.320
Yeah, from high school.

1385
01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:42.620
But I can't remember your name.

1386
01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:44.320
It doesn't matter.

1387
01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:47.620
Remember playing the piano together?

1388
01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:48.700
Of course.

1389
01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.700
Why are you back from Tokyo?

1390
01:53:52.530 --> 01:53:55.490
For the reunion. 
I'm on my way back.

1391
01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:58.240
Why were you invited, but not me?

1392
01:53:58.410 --> 01:54:00.240
Who knows?

1393
01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:05.990
But I'm glad to see you.
I was wondering how you were doing.


1394
01:54:06.370 --> 01:54:07.370
You mean it?

1395
01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:08.990
I do.

1396
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:14.490
I'm glad. I thought no one from
high school would remember me.


1397
01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:19.240
No way. I was secretly proud
that I could talk with you.


1398
01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:21.200
- You were?
- Yeah.


1399
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:27.120
You gave off an antisocial vibe,
but many wanted to talk to you.


1400
01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:29.370
- Are you sure?
- I am.


1401
01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:31.370
You were admired.

1402
01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:34.490
Cut it out. You're gonna make me cry.

1403
01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:39.070
How are you doing?

1404
01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:44.120
Good. There are struggles,
but I live every day to the fullest.


1405
01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:47.620
I'm so glad you haven't changed.

1406
01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.070
And you? Are you good?

1407
01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:55.570
I can't answer straight away like you.

1408
01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:57.120
You're not well?

1409
01:54:57.490 --> 01:54:59.370
- My body's fine.
- Then...


1410
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:03.070
It's not a big problem.

1411
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:08.700
But sometimes I wonder why I'm here.

1412
01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:17.240
I could've become anything,
but time flew past before I knew.


1413
01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:20.240
I'm fairly satisfied.

1414
01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:23.870
This is what I chose.

1415
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:27.950
And I know it's wrong to want more.

1416
01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:30.990
But...

1417
01:55:35.410 --> 01:55:39.740
I'm not passionate
about anything anymore.


1418
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:44.870
I don't know what to do.

1419
01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:47.320
Time is...

1420
01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:50.370
slowly killing me.

1421
01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:01.120
I'm sorry to say
this all of a sudden.

1422
01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:02.990
It's okay.

1423
01:56:05.530 --> 01:56:08.620
Can I tell you how
I saw you back then?

1424
01:56:10.030 --> 01:56:10.820
Sure.

1425
01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.990
You said everyone admired me,
but that's wrong.


1426
01:56:17.530 --> 01:56:22.990
I always felt different,
like everyone observed me from afar.


1427
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:27.950
I always felt like an outcast.

1428
01:56:29.370 --> 01:56:32.370
You were the only one that stepped in.

1429
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:36.820
It was just one step,
but it meant a lot to me.


1430
01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:43.320
You were the only light for me.
I could find you anywhere you were.


1431
01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.320
Your existence gave me power.

1432
01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.240
It's true.

1433
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:55.370
You have the ability
to give people power.


1434
01:56:55.530 --> 01:56:57.200
Please remember that.

1435
01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:00.490
Thanks.

1436
01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:06.990
But I didn't say <i>everyone</i> admired you.

1437
01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.070
Huh?

1438
01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:10.870
I admired you.

1439
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.950
Thank you.

1440
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:24.620
I'm glad I met you.

1441
01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.950
I'm glad I met you, too.

1442
01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:33.870
Bye.

1443
01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.070
See you!

1444
01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:38.370
See you.

1445
01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:54.120
- Wait.
- What's wrong?


1446
01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:58.370
- It's nothing big.
- What is it?


1447
01:58:58.990 --> 01:59:01.240
But I can only tell you.
