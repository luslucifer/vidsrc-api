Part 1 :
Clara's Hair


2
00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.317
Anyway...

3
00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:51.681
I brought this song.

4
00:03:52.684 --> 00:03:54.650
And i think you'll like it.

5
00:03:54.718 --> 00:03:55.784
What is it?

6
00:03:55.784 --> 00:03:58.181
-Let me play it, man.
-You're so curious.


7
00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:00.484
Let's see how good
your stereo is.


8
00:04:00.484 --> 00:04:02.284
I'm playing it loud, alright?
Go ahead, play it loud.


9
00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.341
It will be loud.

10
00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:12.172
Hold on there, 
Martin and Isabela.

11
00:04:19.116 --> 00:04:20.480
That sounds good.

12
00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:41.515
I like it.

13
00:05:11.247 --> 00:05:12.712
What about this brother of mine?

14
00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:21.046
Well, he's good-looking, smart,
funny, good in bed...


15
00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:22.978
What more could i want?

16
00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:26.011
OK, then!

17
00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:29.202
You two make a great couple.

18
00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:32.212
So far so good.

19
00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:33.942
We should go.

20
00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:37.542
Antonio, let's go!

21
00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:18.404
Oh God, there's Adalberto,
uptight as always.


22
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:06.607
How'd it go?
It was so cooll


23
00:07:06.607 --> 00:07:09.106
We went down to the beach...

24
00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:10.873
Yeah, but listen.

25
00:07:10.873 --> 00:07:13.206
You took your time, some
people want to leave already.


26
00:07:13.206 --> 00:07:16.831
Alright, i'll go get
the kids and...


27
00:07:17.405 --> 00:07:19.371
-I'll take Seu Zé a little dish.
-Alright.


28
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.072
Go ahead.

29
00:07:54.438 --> 00:07:55.404
Ops...

30
00:07:58.303 --> 00:07:59.269
Carry on.

31
00:08:05.337 --> 00:08:06.303
Zé?

32
00:08:07.337 --> 00:08:09.803
Some goodies from the party.
Thank you.


33
00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:11.996
Come by later on, OK?
Will do.


34
00:08:18.836 --> 00:08:21.801
Fernando, Fernando, Luiz
Fernando and Julia, let's go!


35
00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.035
Come sing Happy Birthday,
come on.


36
00:08:24.035 --> 00:08:26.899
But we're in the middle of the game!
You can continue later, let's go.


37
00:08:28.435 --> 00:08:29.401
Let's go.

38
00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:46.098
Aunt Lucia,

39
00:08:48.434 --> 00:08:50.424
it's not everyday that
someone turns 70.


40
00:08:51.335 --> 00:08:53.234
I don't know if you
feel your age


41
00:08:53.234 --> 00:08:55.393
or if you're the way
we think you are:


42
00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:57.724
a 70-year-old girl.

43
00:08:58.767 --> 00:08:59.733
I'm twelve

44
00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:03.366
and i remember you taking us,
your great-nieces and nephews,


45
00:09:03.366 --> 00:09:07.129
still young, to the Jaqueira
amusement park


46
00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:11.822
to have ice cream at the FriSabor,
and to the São Luiz cinema.


47
00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:15.826
You are the best
aunt we could ever have.


48
00:09:21.966 --> 00:09:23.932
Aunt Lucia was a f-firecracker,

49
00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:27.026
IS a fire-, is a firecracker.

50
00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:30.866
She was volleyball and ping-pong
champion at the Portuguese Club.


51
00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:35.065
She played guitar, piano,
and violin when she was young,


52
00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:41.827
and pertormed many times at
the St. lzabel Theater.


53
00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:45.865
She begins her life as
a university student at 18,


54
00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:52.422
where she got into the law program
at the Pernambuco Federal,


55
00:09:52.763 --> 00:09:54.730
in the year 1931,

56
00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:57.864
kicking off a victorious career

57
00:09:57.864 --> 00:10:02.830
which made her name synonomous
with determination in her field


58
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.386
in our state

59
00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:10.763
at a time when few women
would attend higher education,


60
00:10:10.763 --> 00:10:15.387
and where few would work
in the field of law and letters.


61
00:10:17.063 --> 00:10:18.824
No, there's more

62
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:23.462
After living and studying
in São Paulo in the 40s,


63
00:10:23.462 --> 00:10:25.762
Aunt Lucia came back
to Pernambuco.


64
00:10:25.762 --> 00:10:28.428
She went to work in the
countryside, in the 60s,


65
00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:32.020
a difficult time for her, for
her family, and for the country.


66
00:10:32.394 --> 00:10:35.122
She was persectued and
even went to prison,


67
00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:38.225
We are very proud of
your journey, Aunt Lucia.


68
00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:43.052
Aunt Lucia's life could fill a book,
a film or a song,


69
00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:48.957
and here we wish you health, happiness,
and propose a toast to you.


70
00:10:49.394 --> 00:10:50.916
To our dear Aunt Lucia!

71
00:10:56.694 --> 00:10:57.660
Go Aunt Lucia!

72
00:11:08.992 --> 00:11:14.948
You forgot or skipped the
sexual revolution


73
00:11:15.692 --> 00:11:16.749
Just kidding, no

74
00:11:16.892 --> 00:11:21.723
I'm very touched. Really. Truly.

75
00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:28.952
But now i want to say
something that was left out,


76
00:11:29.992 --> 00:11:32.889
that you didn't say,
but l'm going to.


77
00:11:35.724 --> 00:11:39.952
You mentioned a number
of things i did,


78
00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:42.688
and which were part
of my life.


79
00:11:43.224 --> 00:11:45.952
But you forgot to
mention Augusto.


80
00:11:47.723 --> 00:11:49.689
Augusto was my partner.

81
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.682
I really liked him.
It was true love.


82
00:11:55.723 --> 00:11:58.951
Augusto passed away,
oh six years now.


83
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.280
He was my partner
for more than 30 years.


84
00:12:06.623 --> 00:12:08.022
He was a very good man.

85
00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:10.682
We never got married because

86
00:12:11.122 --> 00:12:14.952
I think some of you know,
he was already married.


87
00:12:15.622 --> 00:12:18.589
Well, what are you gonna do?
Nobody's pertect.


88
00:12:19.022 --> 00:12:20.987
And today, which is my birthday,

89
00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:24.983
I'd like to propose
a toast to Augusto.


90
00:12:26.689 --> 00:12:27.881
Thank you all very much.

91
00:12:43.854 --> 00:12:47.116
It's hard to top
Aunt Lucia's


92
00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:49.986
sensational words.

93
00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:54.183
But i'm going to say something.
It's quick, but i'm going to say it.


94
00:12:58.953 --> 00:13:00.612
I'm not a religious man,

95
00:13:01.253 --> 00:13:03.718
but i want to say
thank you anyway.


96
00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:09.876
You all know 1979 was not
an easy year here at home.


97
00:13:10.752 --> 00:13:13.912
We went through some really tough
times with Clara's illness,


98
00:13:16.952 --> 00:13:18.680
This woman i love so much.

99
00:13:22.652 --> 00:13:25.617
I can say they were the
toughest months in my life,


100
00:13:27.252 --> 00:13:29.615
taking my wife to hospitals,

101
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.048
watching her deal with
such a harsh treatment,


102
00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:42.644
getting Martin, Ana and Rodrigo together
telling the truth, without telling all,


103
00:13:45.485 --> 00:13:49.041
trying to get on with life,
go to work,


104
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.908
keeping the house in order,
trying to keep some kind of peace


105
00:13:57.583 --> 00:13:59.106
and today Clara's
here with us,


106
00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:08.509
with her Elis Regina hair style,
which i find sexy, l really do.


107
00:14:10.483 --> 00:14:12.142
recovered, and healthy.

108
00:14:17.182 --> 00:14:20.909
Clara's fine, and
we're still together,


109
00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:24.014
getting our lives
back on track.


110
00:14:24.582 --> 00:14:29.037
I just wanted to say, I understand why
some people were absent from this process,


111
00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:33.939
that life doesn't give us a manual
to deal with these situations, right?


112
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.947
Say that i was deeply touched

113
00:14:38.614 --> 00:14:40.580
by the presence of those
that were here with us,


114
00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:45.843
but this is to give thanks
that i have my love here with me.


115
00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:51.345
Long live Clara!

116
00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:54.345
Long live Aunt Lucia!

117
00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:16.634
We cherish this great day

118
00:15:17.011 --> 00:15:21.812
in which we celebrate

119
00:15:21.812 --> 00:15:25.971
May the house you live in

120
00:15:27.011 --> 00:15:31.478
be the home of joy,

121
00:15:31.478 --> 00:15:35.911
refuge from the storm

122
00:15:36.444 --> 00:15:40.899
Happy birthday.

123
00:17:55.702 --> 00:17:56.725
Ladjane!

124
00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:01.226
Ladjane!
Yes!


125
00:18:01.402 --> 00:18:02.802
Hey!
Hey!


126
00:18:02.802 --> 00:18:04.267
What's for lunch?

127
00:18:05.202 --> 00:18:06.361
I was making

128
00:18:07.602 --> 00:18:09.501
What an annoying door!

129
00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:11.302
I was making chicken.

130
00:18:11.302 --> 00:18:14.564
Ah, OK. And do we have any veggies?
Yeah, i'll make some.


131
00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.367
I'm off to the beach.

132
00:19:00.532 --> 00:19:01.732
All right, people, let's go.

133
00:19:01.732 --> 00:19:04.391
This is the HA-HA now,
let it out.


134
00:19:07.132 --> 00:19:08.597
Keep the rhythm!

135
00:19:16.731 --> 00:19:17.788
Speed it up!

136
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:23.297
Speed it up a little, speed it up.

137
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:29.396
Let it out,Paulo.
Let it out, Paulo!


138
00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.296
That's it!

139
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.797
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!


140
00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:47.493
Laugh it up, Paulol

141
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.429
Laughing is serious business.

142
00:19:49.429 --> 00:19:51.089
Hey, Thiago, let it out.

143
00:19:51.629 --> 00:19:53.094
That's it!

144
00:19:54.429 --> 00:19:56.429
Bring it down a little.

145
00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:57.395
Stop!

146
00:19:59.229 --> 00:20:00.195
Laugh

147
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:05.795
That's it!

148
00:20:12.829 --> 00:20:14.829
Energy, people, energy!

149
00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:16.794
C'mon, Clara, let's laugh, Clara

150
00:20:17.828 --> 00:20:19.293
Concentrate

151
00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:27.828
Make yourself at home,
there's room for everyone.


152
00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:29.794
Respect, everyone,
keep it up!


153
00:20:30.828 --> 00:20:32.316
Respect, seriousness...

154
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.226
Bezerra, where you at?

155
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.726
Copy.

156
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.725
Bring the boat over to the Aquarius.

157
00:20:42.259 --> 00:20:43.725
Is Dona Clara going in?

158
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.026
Affirmative.

159
00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:50.425
Affirmative -Copy.
I'm on my way.


160
00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:52.125
Affirmative.

161
00:20:52.259 --> 00:20:56.123
Hey, Roberval! Don't you think
that's a bit much?


162
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:59.320
No way, Clara.
Look at the sea, look


163
00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.016
Nobody's in the water.

164
00:21:02.258 --> 00:21:06.020
Go on, take your dip,
and come on out.Go on


165
00:21:06.358 --> 00:21:08.758
We've talked about this

166
00:21:08.758 --> 00:21:11.418
It's because you're important.
Who told you to be important?


167
00:21:21.757 --> 00:21:23.417
Would you hold this
for me, please?


168
00:21:41.989 --> 00:21:42.956
Clara!

169
00:21:44.389 --> 00:21:45.548
Waist line!

170
00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:16.884
41 years old. Plays perfectly.

171
00:23:19.218 --> 00:23:20.478
Well, i'd like to...

172
00:23:23.217 --> 00:23:27.317
...Start by asking you, ma'am
Sorry


173
00:23:27.317 --> 00:23:32.908
You're writing a new book, and i see
a lot of physical media here, right?


174
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.450
Viny, records, tapes..

175
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.211
At a time when digital
media is taking over everything,


176
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.812
do you only listen to music
the old-fashioned way?


177
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.348
No, i listen to music
the old-fashioned way.


178
00:23:43.348 --> 00:23:45.405
Let's, let's do something,
shall we?


179
00:23:45.949 --> 00:23:51.313
Can we cut this short, so we don't
waste my time, or yours?


180
00:23:52.148 --> 00:23:55.949
I'll explain the way i think,
generally speaking.


181
00:23:55.949 --> 00:23:57.812
I like everything, alright?

182
00:23:57.949 --> 00:23:59.914
mp3s, streaming,

183
00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:02.909
if it's got music, it's good,
it's important,


184
00:24:03.148 --> 00:24:05.307
And this whole
new technology thing.


185
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:08.514
Can i tell you a story?
Sure.


186
00:24:15.547 --> 00:24:18.514
There you go. Did you get it?

187
00:24:20.548 --> 00:24:21.514
Well, then..

188
00:24:24.947 --> 00:24:28.902
This record, i bought in Porto Alegre,
at a used record store.


189
00:24:29.247 --> 00:24:32.144
I leant mine to someone
and never saw it again.


190
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.835
Until one day, a quiet day,
a Sunday,


191
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.179
I opened the record to look
Look what i found inside,


192
00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:45.079
-this article from the Los Angeles Times.
-That's awesome.


193
00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:51.878
This article is from November,

194
00:24:51.878 --> 00:24:57.978
This album, Double Fantasy,
was released in December 1980.


195
00:24:57.978 --> 00:25:05.741
So, this article came out weeks
before Lennon was murdered


196
00:25:06.178 --> 00:25:09.440
on December 8, 1980.

197
00:25:10.278 --> 00:25:13.039
And i was born on December 21, 1980.

198
00:25:13.377 --> 00:25:15.877
That's amazing. Check it out.

199
00:25:15.877 --> 00:25:21.777
This article here, published weeks
before Lennon was murdered


200
00:25:21.777 --> 00:25:23.936
and before you were born,
says the following:


201
00:25:24.377 --> 00:25:27.036
''John Lennon's plans for the future''

202
00:25:28.976 --> 00:25:31.771
This record, this record
I'm holding in my hands,


203
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.367
becomes a special object...

204
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:36.309
You see?

205
00:25:36.309 --> 00:25:37.968
And you don't know who
owned it before?


206
00:25:39.109 --> 00:25:41.010
Didn't i tell you i bought it
down in Porto Alegre...


207
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.909
...at a used record store.
I don't know who owned it,


208
00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:48.909
all i know is it was bought in Los Angeles
and ended up in Porto Alegre,


209
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:52.008
I mean, i'm not even sure
it was bought in Los Angeles, actually,


210
00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:53.167
and it ended up here.

211
00:25:54.708 --> 00:25:58.662
Cool. So, digital media
it's fine with you?


212
00:26:01.707 --> 00:26:05.663
This here is like
a message in a bottle.


213
00:27:56.868 --> 00:27:59.067
-Good afternoon, Ms. Clara.
-Seu Geraldo, good afternoon.


214
00:27:59.067 --> 00:28:01.867
-How are you?
-Fine


215
00:28:01.867 --> 00:28:03.231
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.


216
00:28:03.768 --> 00:28:05.529
Ms. Clara, would you let us
have a word with you?


217
00:28:06.867 --> 00:28:07.867
It depends.

218
00:28:07.867 --> 00:28:11.067
If you're here to
discuss my proposal...


219
00:28:11.067 --> 00:28:13.866
...for the acquisition
of the flat upstairs...


220
00:28:13.866 --> 00:28:19.567
I did send you that proposal, but i never
heard from you, what a busy man you are...


221
00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:21.066
Is this the reason of your visit,
Seu Geraldo?


222
00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:23.531
We are here to talk to you...

223
00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:28.066
...a good, eye to eye conversation,
which is the best thing there is.


224
00:28:28.066 --> 00:28:31.899
We have brought you
a counter-proposal.


225
00:28:31.899 --> 00:28:35.457
That's wondertul!
This is about the upstairs flat, right?


226
00:28:36.499 --> 00:28:39.598
No, this is about that conversation
we had before...


227
00:28:39.598 --> 00:28:41.899
Tihs is about acquiring
your apartment.


228
00:28:41.899 --> 00:28:44.999
About selling this apartment?
Exactly.


229
00:28:44.999 --> 00:28:47.998
I'm not selling, Seu Geraldo,
you already know that.


230
00:28:47.998 --> 00:28:50.598
-Ms. Carla, this proposal.
-Clara.


231
00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:52.064
Ms. Clara.

232
00:28:52.498 --> 00:28:55.861
-Where were you?
-I was downstairs sweeping.


233
00:28:56.898 --> 00:28:58.597
Ms. Clara?

234
00:28:58.597 --> 00:29:00.564
It's a very generous offer.

235
00:29:00.998 --> 00:29:06.097
It's over the market value
for this type and size of apartment,


236
00:29:06.097 --> 00:29:08.859
but we've made this proposal
especially for you.


237
00:29:09.596 --> 00:29:11.153
Let's just get this over with.

238
00:29:11.897 --> 00:29:14.197
Let's just get this over with,
Geraldo.


239
00:29:14.197 --> 00:29:18.151
My apartment is not for sale;
I'm not selling.


240
00:29:18.696 --> 00:29:21.662
I appreciate your visiting,
but i must go.


241
00:29:21.997 --> 00:29:22.860
Ms. Clara,

242
00:29:23.097 --> 00:29:24.596
First of all, congratulations,

243
00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:27.996
I can see from out here that
you've remodeled the apartment,


244
00:29:27.996 --> 00:29:29.596
-it looks beautiful.
-Yes, very interesting.


245
00:29:29.596 --> 00:29:31.797
-Thank you.
-It's in very good taste, congratulations.


246
00:29:31.797 --> 00:29:34.996
My name is Diego, i'm head of
this project at our company,


247
00:29:34.996 --> 00:29:37.796
which is, by the way, my first project,
and i'm really proud of it,


248
00:29:37.796 --> 00:29:40.853
and i think it's safe to say
that i have great news.


249
00:29:41.594 --> 00:29:42.594
Yes?

250
00:29:42.594 --> 00:29:43.958
And i'm going to tell you why.

251
00:29:44.495 --> 00:29:46.858
First of all, the project
is now called ''Aquarius.''


252
00:29:49.594 --> 00:29:54.549
Is he your.. son? Son-in-law?
No, no. This is my grandson, Diego;


253
00:29:54.694 --> 00:29:59.894
He's been doing a good job
at the construction company.


254
00:29:59.894 --> 00:30:00.860
Thank you, grandpa.

255
00:30:01.194 --> 00:30:02.694
Did you say ''Aquarius?''

256
00:30:02.694 --> 00:30:04.094
It's ''The New Aquarius''

257
00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:07.651
The idea is to keep the name of the
building that used to exist in this spot.


258
00:30:08.094 --> 00:30:11.958
''Used to exist?''
Yeah, it's a way of preserving the memory


259
00:30:12.094 --> 00:30:13.993
...of the original building.
This is a new idea.


260
00:30:13.993 --> 00:30:17.153
...but now with the new offer, another
piece of good news we bring you


261
00:30:19.193 --> 00:30:21.159
The building exists.

262
00:30:22.193 --> 00:30:24.658
You're standing there,
leaning on it.


263
00:30:25.193 --> 00:30:27.193
Wrong way to express myself.

264
00:30:27.193 --> 00:30:28.159
I see...

265
00:30:29.692 --> 00:30:32.681
Now, before i go in and
close the door,


266
00:30:34.426 --> 00:30:35.585
tell me something

267
00:30:37.125 --> 00:30:42.387
What was the name of the original project,
before this ''New Aquarius?''


268
00:30:44.426 --> 00:30:47.825
The original project was
the ''Atlantic Plaza Residence.''


269
00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:51.425
Yes, that'd be a good name,
it sounds good, doesn't it?


270
00:30:51.425 --> 00:30:52.891
We much prefer ''Aquarius''...

271
00:30:56.124 --> 00:30:58.425
Well, thank you so much for this...

272
00:30:58.425 --> 00:31:03.880
We'd like to point out that we are
always open to dialogue.


273
00:31:04.424 --> 00:31:07.390
OK, thank you. Excuse me.
See you later.


274
00:31:38.755 --> 00:31:41.720
In case you want to read it later,
on your own, the project


275
00:31:43.755 --> 00:31:44.721
Thank you, Clara.

276
00:31:54.554 --> 00:31:57.418
I'll go get some water because
I know you're upset, OK?


277
00:32:38.285 --> 00:32:41.649
Part 2 Clara's Love

278
00:34:02.213 --> 00:34:03.414
Alright?

279
00:34:03.414 --> 00:34:05.380
Where are my songs?

280
00:34:05.813 --> 00:34:07.414
Here on the flash drive.

281
00:34:07.414 --> 00:34:09.380
On the pen drive?

282
00:34:10.414 --> 00:34:12.713
But you'll transfer them
to my cell phone later?


283
00:34:12.713 --> 00:34:14.413
Sure, i'll do that.
Will you?


284
00:34:14.413 --> 00:34:17.413
Yeah, we'll do that later.
OK. Did everything fit?


285
00:34:17.413 --> 00:34:19.777
Yeah, that list you sent me fit,

286
00:34:19.912 --> 00:34:23.867
and i put some new stuff i think you'll like.
Yeah? That's great.


287
00:34:24.912 --> 00:34:28.867
So that's how it is now, huh?
You Suggesting stuff.


288
00:34:29.512 --> 00:34:32.603
Let me just put it on here,
just a second,


289
00:34:33.445 --> 00:34:35.446
there it is. Listen to this.

290
00:34:35.446 --> 00:34:37.411
You don't know me.

291
00:34:37.644 --> 00:34:41.304
I have to shout this, because
you're deaf and won't listen to me.


292
00:34:41.645 --> 00:34:44.303
Seduction enslaves you.

293
00:34:44.644 --> 00:34:48.444
At the end of it all, you remain with me,
trapped in what i created.


294
00:34:48.444 --> 00:34:49.744
That's funny.

295
00:34:49.744 --> 00:34:53.506
And the more i talk about the whole truth
-What is it?


296
00:34:54.444 --> 00:34:56.410
Oh, l'm just kinda happy today.

297
00:34:57.344 --> 00:34:59.809
Yeah? Why?

298
00:35:00.343 --> 00:35:04.708
This girl i know's arriving from Rio.
On Thursday.


299
00:35:05.444 --> 00:35:08.409
Oh yeah? She's arriving?
What's the deal?


300
00:35:09.243 --> 00:35:11.243
Oh, we met on Facebook.

301
00:35:11.243 --> 00:35:14.801
She's a friend of Marcelo's. Remember him?
Yeah. I remember Marcelo.


302
00:35:15.243 --> 00:35:17.209
So we met through him,

303
00:35:18.243 --> 00:35:20.209
we chatted for a while,

304
00:35:20.542 --> 00:35:22.509
we liked each other,
and now she's on her way!


305
00:35:23.542 --> 00:35:27.742
Cooll And where's she staying?

306
00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:29.503
At my place.

307
00:35:31.176 --> 00:35:34.141
Do your parents know?
Yeah, they know.


308
00:35:37.475 --> 00:35:40.440
So, delivery style, huh?

309
00:35:41.474 --> 00:35:43.440
''Delivery,'' aunt,

310
00:35:44.274 --> 00:35:45.638
I don't know, we'll see.

311
00:35:46.674 --> 00:35:49.435
I think she's great.
We'll see where things go.


312
00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:51.638
Love it.

313
00:35:53.775 --> 00:35:59.139
Does this beauty have a name?
She does. It's Julia.


314
00:35:59.573 --> 00:36:01.539
Julia. Beautiful name.
I love it.


315
00:36:02.473 --> 00:36:03.529
Look

316
00:36:04.273 --> 00:36:06.239
Do this,

317
00:36:07.273 --> 00:36:09.239
play Maria Bethania for her.

318
00:36:10.073 --> 00:36:12.038
Show her you're intense.

319
00:36:12.472 --> 00:36:14.132
All right, i will.

320
00:36:55.203 --> 00:36:57.669
-Good evening.
-Hey, how are you?


321
00:36:58.004 --> 00:37:00.003
-Fine, fine.
-Beautiful as always.


322
00:37:00.003 --> 00:37:01.468
Thank you, dear.

323
00:37:02.203 --> 00:37:04.169
-I missed you..
-Son, how are you?


324
00:37:07.302 --> 00:37:09.268
And what is their proposal?

325
00:37:10.102 --> 00:37:12.069
Oh, I don't know,
I tore up the envelope.


326
00:37:14.103 --> 00:37:15.068
You tore it up?

327
00:37:16.302 --> 00:37:19.564
You weren't even curious
to know what it was?


328
00:37:21.002 --> 00:37:21.559
No.

329
00:37:25.602 --> 00:37:27.568
That's my sister

330
00:37:29.602 --> 00:37:31.397
You're abolutely right.

331
00:37:32.034 --> 00:37:38.297
Aren't there any legal maneuvers
to make these people leave me alone?


332
00:37:38.435 --> 00:37:40.334
But they came,
knocked on your door,


333
00:37:40.334 --> 00:37:44.199
asked to speak to you. there's,
there's nothing illegal there.


334
00:37:45.135 --> 00:37:48.434
Are the other apartments all empty,
or anyone letting?


335
00:37:48.434 --> 00:37:49.634
All empty.

336
00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:54.589
They bought them all. So it's up to them,
if they sell them, rent them, whatever.


337
00:37:57.633 --> 00:38:02.587
Clara, i didn't want to say anything,
but i must.


338
00:38:03.433 --> 00:38:07.889
I just think about one thing
your quality of life.


339
00:38:08.233 --> 00:38:09.893
That's the only thing
I worry about.


340
00:38:12.632 --> 00:38:13.893
The rest is just the rest.

341
00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:17.197
Yeah well

342
00:38:19.031 --> 00:38:20.997
You know what i want
to do this week?


343
00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:23.932
I want to go out dancing.
Oh, that's great.


344
00:38:23.932 --> 00:38:26.332
Come with me, Fatima.
Oh yeah, I'll come!


345
00:38:26.332 --> 00:38:29.332
Let's go!
Yeah! Antonio please let me go.


346
00:38:29.332 --> 00:38:31.423
Oh, I guess i'm not going

347
00:38:32.265 --> 00:38:34.864
Did i hear that, ''Antonio
please let me go''?


348
00:38:34.864 --> 00:38:36.831
Yeah, he has to let me.

349
00:38:37.564 --> 00:38:39.826
I thought l was going.

350
00:38:40.264 --> 00:38:44.423
Well, well, well
No shortage of male dancers there.


351
00:39:12.863 --> 00:39:14.862
How do you know
so much gossip?


352
00:39:14.862 --> 00:39:18.462
And you share it like it's
all true. Amazing.


353
00:39:18.462 --> 00:39:21.826
Girl, the headquarters
of Pernambuco gossip?


354
00:39:22.128 --> 00:39:23.822
The swimming pool
at the German club.


355
00:39:26.862 --> 00:39:29.828
That's why
you're all so tan


356
00:39:30.861 --> 00:39:36.361
The dark skin The tongues,
but the poison now. Oh my God!


357
00:39:36.361 --> 00:39:39.560
When i arrived in Recife

358
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.822
I practically married
the whole Jewish community.


359
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.883
No, honey, no no no no,

360
00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:45.927
you fucked the whole
Jewish community.


361
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.260
Me?

362
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.160
She's truly generous.

363
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.126
I'm a good person!

364
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.126
-I felt sorry for them
-That's exactly why!


365
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.160
Check it out.

366
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.159
-Take a look over there, Leandro.
-Who?


367
00:40:03.159 --> 00:40:05.159
A retired lawyer from CHESF.

368
00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:06.989
He was married to Ana Lucia,

369
00:40:07.926 --> 00:40:12.859
who died some 10 years ago. Horrible.
''The Big C'' in her uterus.


370
00:40:12.859 --> 00:40:15.925
Enough with this disease talk.

371
00:40:15.925 --> 00:40:19.186
This is a party.
Let's talk about happy stuff?


372
00:40:19.258 --> 00:40:21.019
She took everything out,
poor thing.


373
00:40:21.558 --> 00:40:24.258
And Bento, having an affair with Silvia?
They are trying to be discreet.


374
00:40:24.258 --> 00:40:26.524
They're dancing.
Don't stare. Be discreet.


375
00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:27.858
but i see what's going on.

376
00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:31.256
This Silvia is the one
who went to our bookstore


377
00:40:31.458 --> 00:40:34.157
to buy three meters of books

378
00:40:34.157 --> 00:40:36.055
because her interior
decorator told her to!


379
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.748
Three meters? God!

380
00:40:40.058 --> 00:40:43.421
With brains like that you
should've asked, ''open or closed?''


381
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:57.989
This party sucks.

382
00:40:57.989 --> 00:41:02.256
You told me there'd be good
looking men here; I have yet to see one!


383
00:41:02.256 --> 00:41:04.989
Except for that waiter

384
00:41:04.989 --> 00:41:06.955
-There are good-looking men
-yes, yes there are.


385
00:41:08.389 --> 00:41:11.947
You're the one
who needs glasses.


386
00:41:13.189 --> 00:41:16.120
Yes, there are.
Where, Clara?


387
00:41:16.888 --> 00:41:19.013
Yes, there are.
Who, Clara?


388
00:41:19.155 --> 00:41:23.211
I don't know; i'm not giving
I'm not giving


389
00:41:24.055 --> 00:41:27.249
Clara, you've got your eye on the guy
from Espirito Santo back there, right?


390
00:41:28.055 --> 00:41:29.351
-Who?
-Which one?


391
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.687
Don't look, people!

392
00:41:33.221 --> 00:41:34.921
And he's got his eye on you;
I saw itl


393
00:41:34.921 --> 00:41:37.886
I heard he's a widower.

394
00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.720
He's oh, 60, 65.

395
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.787
-He's not my type.
-He's not your type.


396
00:41:46.787 --> 00:41:48.286
What, people?
He still looks good. What?


397
00:41:48.286 --> 00:41:54.082
Tell me do you remember why
we came here tonight? Do you?


398
00:41:54.186 --> 00:41:55.345
I came to drink.

399
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.986
No, that thing we came
here to talk about.


400
00:41:59.986 --> 00:42:04.145
Leticia, we need to talk to you.
Oh, come on, people!


401
00:42:05.085 --> 00:42:07.986
No, we just really,
truly want to know, you know?


402
00:42:07.986 --> 00:42:11.849
If everything's OK and how your
professional help is going.


403
00:42:14.918 --> 00:42:17.884
I have enjoyed it responsibly.

404
00:42:21.385 --> 00:42:23.284
You want his phone?

405
00:42:23.284 --> 00:42:24.785
I already have a phone,
thank you.


406
00:42:24.785 --> 00:42:27.717
No, the it's the boy's.

407
00:42:27.717 --> 00:42:29.377
I don't have the guts
to get his number.


408
00:42:30.017 --> 00:42:32.618
I don't know never say never.

409
00:42:32.618 --> 00:42:33.751
Lucrecia, you wanna know something?

410
00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:36.808
I always figured that if any of us
had the guts, it'd be you.


411
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:39.076
-Me?!
-Yeah, with your wholesome face.


412
00:42:40.151 --> 00:42:44.809
What's the big deal? It's just a man
to play with you a young man,


413
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:49.750
-professional hot...
-That's good. Professional is good.


414
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.307
I like that. Hot is good.

415
00:42:53.117 --> 00:42:56.083
Oh, then i'll give you his number.
No, thank you very much.


416
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.649
Guys, i'm missing the joke,
this side can't hear!


417
00:42:59.649 --> 00:43:03.950
Don't put off what
you can do right now.


418
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.813
What is this?
A gigolo commercial?


419
00:43:08.249 --> 00:43:10.714
Like those fridge magnets, you know?
Do it now while you still have


420
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:12.905
Like those thingies
you stick to the...


421
00:43:13.148 --> 00:43:16.911
Do it now while
you're still healthy.


422
00:43:21.647 --> 00:43:22.908
Would you like to dance?

423
00:43:24.348 --> 00:43:25.314
Hi!

424
00:43:27.014 --> 00:43:28.979
What a surprise!

425
00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:37.280
Anybody hold on
to my phone?


426
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.246
We will keep your phone.

427
00:44:00.879 --> 00:44:03.645
I've been living in Fortaleza.

428
00:44:03.645 --> 00:44:05.543
You talk real quiet,
don't you?


429
00:44:06.946 --> 00:44:09.104
Are you here visiting?

430
00:44:09.978 --> 00:44:14.579
I came to spend a few months
with my daughter.


431
00:44:14.579 --> 00:44:17.942
She lives here, so i'm here.

432
00:44:18.077 --> 00:44:19.634
And your wife?

433
00:44:19.778 --> 00:44:24.108
Well, i'm a widower.
lt's been five years.


434
00:44:26.578 --> 00:44:28.237
I'm also a widow.

435
00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:30.870
Yeah.

436
00:44:31.111 --> 00:44:32.042
How long?

437
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.042
17 years.

438
00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:42.710
Had you ever come
to Clube das Pás?


439
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.642
It's great, really great.

440
00:45:02.075 --> 00:45:04.042
What great memories!

441
00:46:48.369 --> 00:46:49.336
Am i going too far?

442
00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:53.602
No

443
00:46:55.868 --> 00:46:57.892
I had surgery

444
00:47:03.868 --> 00:47:04.834
Breast?

445
00:47:08.469 --> 00:47:09.435
Breast.

446
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.466
You're you're great.

447
00:47:44.866 --> 00:47:47.627
But i need to
to take you home.


448
00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:54.554
I'll get a taxi.
No, no, i insist. I'll take you home.


449
00:48:00.665 --> 00:48:02.324
Thanks, mister.

450
00:48:06.698 --> 00:48:09.664
Good night! You can go.

451
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.586
I'm here every day; I know what
I'm talking about, Clara.


452
00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.710
You're fear mongering.

453
00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.718
It's good to be a
little afraid, isn't it?


454
00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:33.648
I mean, i'm not a big fan
of this whole fear thing either.


455
00:51:34.152 --> 00:51:36.414
I think there's enough
fear going around.


456
00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:40.352
But in my line of work,
we deal with that, right?


457
00:51:40.586 --> 00:51:42.685
How many times have me
and my colleagues


458
00:51:42.685 --> 00:51:44.585
saved people who
weren't afraid enough?


459
00:51:44.585 --> 00:51:46.518
People who forgot
to be afraid?


460
00:51:48.686 --> 00:51:53.140
Clara Look discretely
to my right


461
00:51:53.685 --> 00:51:55.344
A kid's riding up on a bike.

462
00:51:55.585 --> 00:52:00.642
Give me a hint, what's he wearing?
-Grey t-shirt, black shorts.


463
00:52:04.652 --> 00:52:06.344
He's a drug dealer.

464
00:52:08.384 --> 00:52:09.350
Does he sell weed?

465
00:52:10.384 --> 00:52:14.339
They say it's the good stuff,
but he only sells to the rich kids.


466
00:52:16.384 --> 00:52:19.646
Expensive bike
White boy.


467
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:22.609
He comes in every
Monday and Wednesday, mornings.


468
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.716
Afternoons, on fridays.

469
00:52:29.516 --> 00:52:32.277
Do you collaborate
with the police?


470
00:52:32.416 --> 00:52:35.382
Nope. We're too exposed.

471
00:52:36.116 --> 00:52:37.673
This beach is rough.

472
00:52:39.415 --> 00:52:43.383
His office is
behind the kiosks.


473
00:52:43.383 --> 00:52:44.349
Clara

474
00:52:46.315 --> 00:52:46.981
Good morning.

475
00:52:46.981 --> 00:52:48.641
Daniel.
Daniel?


476
00:52:49.415 --> 00:52:51.438
Son of Jorge, your old neighbors.

477
00:52:52.482 --> 00:52:56.379
Hi, Daniel, how have you been?
How's your father?


478
00:52:56.715 --> 00:52:59.273
Dad passed away,
two years now.


479
00:53:00.315 --> 00:53:04.679
I hadn't heard my condolences.
Thank you.


480
00:53:05.681 --> 00:53:08.414
I was passing by and
thought i'd come over


481
00:53:08.414 --> 00:53:12.244
to ask you to solve
this apartment situation.


482
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.942
It's hurting so many people.

483
00:53:15.314 --> 00:53:19.040
Dad made the deal 6 years ago,
he died and so far, nothing.


484
00:53:20.513 --> 00:53:22.680
I don't understand.
Yes you do.


485
00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.339
You understand fine.
You are not stupid.


486
00:53:27.512 --> 00:53:29.376
Everyone moved out of
the building, except you.


487
00:53:30.146 --> 00:53:32.612
If you really think about it,
you're being selfish.


488
00:53:33.945 --> 00:53:36.946
Daniel, i've known you
since you were a child.


489
00:53:36.946 --> 00:53:40.276
You used to surf on this
very beach with my kids.


490
00:53:42.312 --> 00:53:44.278
Yeah, you knew me
when i was a kid,


491
00:53:45.045 --> 00:53:47.273
but you don't know me
as an adult.


492
00:53:52.345 --> 00:53:53.311
Have a good day, Clara.

493
00:54:31.076 --> 00:54:32.804
What are those mattresses for?

494
00:54:36.443 --> 00:54:38.033
I don't know.

495
00:54:48.575 --> 00:54:49.541
Gosh!

496
00:54:50.475 --> 00:54:52.839
Come over here, i want
to show you something.


497
00:54:52.974 --> 00:54:53.940
OK.

498
00:55:14.074 --> 00:55:18.940
We hail this great day

499
00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:23.804
that you commemorate today.

500
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:29.162
May the house you live in

501
00:55:33.205 --> 00:55:34.364
Ladjane

502
00:55:35.405 --> 00:55:38.860
She remembered!
Today's your birthday!


503
00:55:44.405 --> 00:55:46.371
Happy birthday, you hear?
Thanks.


504
00:55:47.305 --> 00:55:51.930
You know you can count on me, don't you?
I know, i know.


505
00:56:25.969 --> 00:56:26.935
Good morning, Clara.

506
00:56:29.235 --> 00:56:30.861
Good afternoon.
How are you?


507
00:56:32.436 --> 00:56:34.836
What's your name again?
Josimar.


508
00:56:34.836 --> 00:56:37.135
Josimar, good afternoon.
And you, what's your name?


509
00:56:37.135 --> 00:56:39.260
Rivanildo. Rivanildo.

510
00:56:40.002 --> 00:56:41.263
Good afternoon, Rivanildo.

511
00:56:41.935 --> 00:56:44.702
And your name Diogo, right?
Diego.


512
00:56:44.702 --> 00:56:49.657
Diego, you brought some
mattresses over to the building.


513
00:56:50.435 --> 00:56:53.401
Could l possibly
know what for, why?


514
00:56:54.001 --> 00:56:59.234
Clara, the apartments may be vacant,
but they belong to the construction company.


515
00:56:59.234 --> 00:57:01.665
We can bring whatever's
necessary for the job.


516
00:57:04.233 --> 00:57:05.256
Right.

517
00:57:07.301 --> 00:57:08.391
Makes sense.

518
00:57:10.033 --> 00:57:13.158
Could you please move this car?
l'm leaving.


519
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.093
Now?
Now.


520
00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:19.856
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Clara.


521
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:23.287
I wrote some things down,
you know?


522
00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:25.818
For you.

523
00:58:30.862 --> 00:58:31.828
It's easier.

524
01:00:09.956 --> 01:00:11.854
It goes like this:
I have no color,


525
01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:17.645
I have no shape, i have no smell
and l am weigthless.


526
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:20.620
When i'm strong,
they call me wind.


527
01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:24.656
When i stink, they call me fart.

528
01:00:34.488 --> 01:00:36.454
Lookie here. He was awake.

529
01:00:37.088 --> 01:00:39.748
I didn't wake anybody up!
He was already awake.


530
01:00:46.587 --> 01:00:48.553
So good to have you here.

531
01:00:50.488 --> 01:00:52.453
I missed you, did you know that?

532
01:00:53.187 --> 01:00:57.847
We could set up something
at our place, huh? Everybody.


533
01:00:58.521 --> 01:00:59.486
What about Marcio?

534
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.486
He's in Brasiilia.

535
01:01:03.787 --> 01:01:08.586
Marcio is the one
I haven't even met yet?


536
01:01:08.586 --> 01:01:09.586
It's on you, Rodrigo.

537
01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:12.484
The rush, you know, Mom.
I just haven't had time yet.


538
01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.086
And you don't have a photo, you don't
carry a picture of him in your wallet?


539
01:01:18.086 --> 01:01:20.745
Anything? To show me?

540
01:01:21.186 --> 01:01:22.152
I got one here.

541
01:01:22.885 --> 01:01:24.749
Mom wants to give her blessing.

542
01:01:26.585 --> 01:01:28.551
You've got to get
her blessing, Rodrigo.


543
01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:33.683
Tell me something while your brother
looks for a picture he can show me.


544
01:01:34.518 --> 01:01:36.519
What's this Marcio like?

545
01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:40.718
Ah, Marcio's a nice guy,
laid back, from Minas.


546
01:01:40.718 --> 01:01:41.775
It's working out, isn't it?

547
01:01:42.751 --> 01:01:43.717
It is.

548
01:01:44.052 --> 01:01:46.518
Let me see.
Wait, let me find one.


549
01:01:46.518 --> 01:01:48.006
Oops, now l saw one
i didn't want to.


550
01:01:49.817 --> 01:01:52.579
This is Marcio.
He's from Belo Horizonte.


551
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.074
Oh, that's nice.

552
01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:58.380
I like him. Look at that
friendly face!


553
01:01:59.117 --> 01:02:00.450
You hadn't met him either?

554
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.779
I had seen pictures.
Not even pictures for me.


555
01:02:03.716 --> 01:02:05.450
Now you've seen him,
you've been introduced.


556
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:06.650
Thank you.

557
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:12.673
Son, please, come by more,
come visit me more often.


558
01:02:13.016 --> 01:02:15.516
And don't just send messages.

559
01:02:15.516 --> 01:02:19.573
Call me. I want to hear
your voice, alright?


560
01:02:20.015 --> 01:02:22.573
And bring Marcio here;
I want to meet Marcio.


561
01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:25.778
I'm alive, you know?

562
01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.911
Mom, how are you dealing
with this situation?


563
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:39.540
Well, i'm pissed, right?

564
01:02:48.847 --> 01:02:52.802
Don't you think you're
stressed out about all this?


565
01:02:53.747 --> 01:02:57.839
No. I said l'm pissed.
You're the ones getting stressed out.


566
01:02:58.048 --> 01:03:03.047
Well, you tell us what's going on,
and we get worried, that's all.


567
01:03:03.047 --> 01:03:04.842
What about those stickers
on the doors?


568
01:03:05.746 --> 01:03:07.336
Stickers? What stickers?

569
01:03:07.646 --> 01:03:08.543
On the doors.

570
01:03:09.479 --> 01:03:10.445
What doors?

571
01:03:10.846 --> 01:03:13.710
Construction company stickers.
On the apartment doors.


572
01:03:14.578 --> 01:03:17.806
The company logo's
on every door, Mom.


573
01:03:18.845 --> 01:03:19.811
Except yours.

574
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.610
We thought you had seen them.

575
01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:11.541
No the stickers are there,
but i hadn't seen them.


576
01:04:11.609 --> 01:04:15.976
Something new every day,
one day one thing, the next it's stickers


577
01:04:15.976 --> 01:04:18.533
They must have gone up today.

578
01:04:20.375 --> 01:04:22.676
Did you come up this way?
The front door.


579
01:04:22.676 --> 01:04:23.976
Are there stickers on that end?
Yep.


580
01:04:23.976 --> 01:04:26.338
Front doors and the back doors.
Well


581
01:04:29.242 --> 01:04:33.442
I'll repeat myself and say
something nobody wants to say to you.


582
01:04:33.442 --> 01:04:36.896
I think you need to sell this place.
You'll be saving yourself problems.


583
01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:38.500
What problems?

584
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.565
Mother, it's just that

585
01:04:44.507 --> 01:04:49.769
The three of us worry about you,
alone in a ghost building.


586
01:04:51.307 --> 01:04:54.273
A what building?
A ''ghost building''?


587
01:04:56.207 --> 01:04:57.706
You have no limits, do you?

588
01:04:57.706 --> 01:05:02.571
Your, shall we say, sensibilities
Mother.


589
01:05:04.807 --> 01:05:09.170
Your world vision.
Mom, i'm saying i worry about you.


590
01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:17.500
You're living in a building that's
uncomfortable, old, unsafe, and empty.


591
01:05:17.738 --> 01:05:23.398
So when you like it, it's ''vintage''; when
you don't like it, it's old. ls that right?


592
01:05:24.405 --> 01:05:28.361
You know what? Let's move to the living room.
And i should say something:


593
01:05:28.672 --> 01:05:34.298
Before you leave, you'll do the dishes.
Ladjane's not here today.


594
01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:43.433
-Let's go.
-Let's go.


595
01:05:46.137 --> 01:05:49.103
Changing rooms
is not going to solve the problem.


596
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:54.494
He who cooked
doesn't wash, OK?


597
01:05:56.469 --> 01:06:01.137
Well, since i'm playing the witch today
anyway, let me just ask you something?


598
01:06:01.137 --> 01:06:04.536
Have you at least considered
their offer?


599
01:06:04.536 --> 01:06:07.836
Because what they're offering
is not the standard market price.


600
01:06:07.836 --> 01:06:12.435
The standard is to offer
new apartment space.


601
01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.835
They're offering cash.

602
01:06:13.835 --> 01:06:15.698
That's like
an offer you can't refuse.


603
01:06:16.336 --> 01:06:17.800
And how do you know all this?

604
01:06:19.235 --> 01:06:21.168
Did they get to you guys?

605
01:06:21.168 --> 01:06:22.335
Not me, no.
I don't even live here, Mom.


606
01:06:22.335 --> 01:06:25.834
Yes, yes, i even told the boys,
they came to talk to me.


607
01:06:25.834 --> 01:06:29.426
Did they come talk to you,
or did you go look for them?


608
01:06:30.101 --> 01:06:34.367
Yes, Mom, i went. I have every right
to try to understand what's going on.


609
01:06:34.367 --> 01:06:39.322
I went to try By the way, the young
man seemed to be extremely nice.


610
01:06:40.367 --> 01:06:44.527
So, Aninha, what is their offer?

611
01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.258
They're offering almost
two million reais.


612
01:06:48.167 --> 01:06:49.223
For this apartment.

613
01:06:53.767 --> 01:06:56.426
-Ana Paula...
-I think it's low.


614
01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.624
The issue isn't the money,
is it, Martin?


615
01:06:58.766 --> 01:07:04.563
What do you mean by ''this'',
a pause, ''apartment.''


616
01:07:05.399 --> 01:07:08.422
Ah, Mom, i meant
it's that much money,


617
01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:11.427
for this apartment.
That's all i meant.


618
01:07:13.265 --> 01:07:18.425
Well, then, this apartment,
the apartment where you all grew up.


619
01:07:18.699 --> 01:07:22.425
This apartment
is on Boa Viagem beach.


620
01:07:23.798 --> 01:07:29.097
Can't you see that by going
to talk to them, you go over my head,


621
01:07:29.097 --> 01:07:35.189
you disrespect me, yes, you set me up
as the ''crazy lady from the Aquarius''.


622
01:07:36.997 --> 01:07:43.157
But that's what happens; you talk to these
people, it sets me up as a nutjob, you know?


623
01:07:43.531 --> 01:07:47.485
You guys don't know what it's like
to feel crazy without being crazy,


624
01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:51.430
you feel like you're going crazy.
You know what that's like, son.


625
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:55.397
You know what that's like,
knowing you're not going crazy,


626
01:07:55.397 --> 01:07:57.488
and that the madness
is out there, don't you?


627
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.052
You all remember.

628
01:08:01.229 --> 01:08:04.161
Another thing that's
really crazy around here


629
01:08:04.496 --> 01:08:06.985
is that we're talking about money.

630
01:08:08.728 --> 01:08:11.595
I can help you guys
any time you want.


631
01:08:11.595 --> 01:08:15.296
We don't need help, Mom.
Well, listen, maybe Ana does.


632
01:08:15.296 --> 01:08:18.159
I've already said
Is it you that needs money, Ana Paula?


633
01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:22.595
Look, Mom, you're probably the person
in this room that knows best


634
01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:25.492
how tough it's been for
me since my separation,


635
01:08:26.094 --> 01:08:29.219
now what i'm telling you is that
this is not just about money.


636
01:08:29.528 --> 01:08:34.983
I can help any of you at any time;
I've got my pension,


637
01:08:35.627 --> 01:08:37.422
I have five apartments,

638
01:08:39.228 --> 01:08:46.127
and there's a legacy that was built
by me and your father, that's yours.


639
01:08:46.127 --> 01:08:51.226
Oh, please, Mom, it wasn't
built by your writing career.


640
01:08:51.226 --> 01:08:53.027
Don't say that, for God's sake.

641
01:08:53.027 --> 01:08:55.127
What does Dad have
to do with this, Ana Paula?


642
01:08:55.127 --> 01:08:58.115
Dad's not around anymore
Why are we talking about Dad anyway?


643
01:08:59.459 --> 01:09:00.425
Paulinho da Viola.

644
01:09:03.159 --> 01:09:06.023
''There are people
with nerves of steel,


645
01:09:07.325 --> 01:09:09.292
with no blood in their veins,

646
01:09:10.326 --> 01:09:12.291
and with no heart

647
01:09:14.325 --> 01:09:18.280
But sometimes, going through
what i go through,


648
01:09:19.525 --> 01:09:20.490
Lupiscinio

649
01:09:22.624 --> 01:09:24.181
Are you singing for me?

650
01:09:25.325 --> 01:09:28.085
Ana, daughter,

651
01:09:29.557 --> 01:09:33.012
Your dad's widow here is me,
not you, you hear?


652
01:09:34.457 --> 01:09:35.923
lt's hard, isn't it?

653
01:09:38.324 --> 01:09:40.290
So hard

654
01:09:46.523 --> 01:09:50.285
But, that's life! And you'll
just have to get used to it.


655
01:09:52.323 --> 01:09:55.289
Now, what you said about my work,

656
01:09:56.256 --> 01:09:58.279
that's something you're going
to have to learn to deal with.


657
01:09:58.423 --> 01:10:00.888
That's up to you;
it's got nothing to do with me.


658
01:10:02.355 --> 01:10:04.617
You know? i am who i am.

659
01:10:05.622 --> 01:10:12.612
And that's how i raised you.
Me and your father, together.


660
01:10:13.222 --> 01:10:18.279
Now, everything you're saying,
and the way you're saying it,


661
01:10:19.022 --> 01:10:24.354
Makes you sound like...

662
01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:25.920
like an idiot.

663
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.216
Hey, Mom No need for that.

664
01:10:31.254 --> 01:10:32.453
Yeah, an imbecile, crazy,

665
01:10:32.453 --> 01:10:36.387
because nobody remembers
when you spent two years away


666
01:10:36.387 --> 01:10:38.013
and Dad raised us by himself.

667
01:10:38.553 --> 01:10:41.986
But you'd send us those cute
postcards, didn't you, Mom?


668
01:10:41.986 --> 01:10:44.214
Aninha, you have no right
to say that, OK?


669
01:10:44.487 --> 01:10:45.453
You're talking too much.

670
01:10:47.054 --> 01:10:49.212
She just called me an imbecile
and you didn't say a thing, did you?


671
01:10:49.286 --> 01:10:51.116
Cause sometimes you
do get kinda silly.


672
01:11:03.386 --> 01:11:05.408
ALL THE SONGS WE CAN'T SEE
An essay on Heitor Villa-Lobos


673
01:11:11.551 --> 01:11:16.245
''To Martin, Ana Paula and Rodrigo. For the
hours of leisure that were taken from you.''


674
01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:26.510
I'm sorry, Mother.

675
01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:28.481
I'm sorry, Mother.

676
01:11:30.484 --> 01:11:31.450
Come over here.

677
01:11:32.517 --> 01:11:37.142
You're so stubborn.
You're like an old lady and a child.


678
01:11:39.484 --> 01:11:42.143
That's because i am
an old lady and a child.


679
01:11:42.784 --> 01:11:43.749
All together.

680
01:17:57.394 --> 01:17:58.553
Hello?

681
01:17:58.794 --> 01:17:59.851
Paulo?

682
01:18:00.095 --> 01:18:01.459
Yeah, it's me.

683
01:18:01.694 --> 01:18:04.395
You don't know me,
My name is Clara.


684
01:18:04.395 --> 01:18:07.656
I'm a friend of Leticia's,
she gave me your number.


685
01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:13.061
How are you, Clara?
Yeah, she told me about you.


686
01:18:14.793 --> 01:18:17.453
So, are you available, Paulo?

687
01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:19.857
Right now?

688
01:18:20.594 --> 01:18:21.752
Yeah, right now.

689
01:18:55.925 --> 01:18:58.289
Quite a party upstairs.
Yes, it is.


690
01:18:59.925 --> 01:19:02.686
Nice place.
Thank you.


691
01:19:04.324 --> 01:19:06.882
LP collection

692
01:19:11.324 --> 01:19:15.024
You want to drink? I'm trying
to finish off that bottle of wine


693
01:19:15.024 --> 01:19:16.886
No thanks, I'm driving.

694
01:19:17.823 --> 01:19:19.687
Please, sit down.

695
01:19:30.023 --> 01:19:31.886
Leticia told me about you.

696
01:19:33.322 --> 01:19:34.981
You really are beautiful.

697
01:19:41.322 --> 01:19:42.582
I want you to leave.

698
01:19:45.623 --> 01:19:46.486
What's that?

699
01:19:47.422 --> 01:19:48.581
You want me to leave?

700
01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.580
I want you to fuck me.

701
01:20:36.552 --> 01:20:38.212
No need.

702
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:12.510
Not here...

703
01:21:14.351 --> 01:21:15.907
-This one?
-Here.


704
01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.768
Hey. Come on.

705
01:22:29.813 --> 01:22:30.779
Get out, get out, get out!

706
01:22:32.212 --> 01:22:33.178
Up here!

707
01:22:34.713 --> 01:22:36.769
She's getting out.
She is?


708
01:22:41.812 --> 01:22:44.411
Roberval, i wanted
to ask you something


709
01:22:44.411 --> 01:22:46.511
I don't even know if you can, but

710
01:22:46.511 --> 01:22:50.773
do you have a number l could call,
in case of an emergency?


711
01:22:52.211 --> 01:22:53.370
Sure.

712
01:22:53.711 --> 01:22:57.576
OK, but, do you need any help?
Any kind of trouble?


713
01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:00.777
No, no, no,
just in case, really.


714
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.476
OK.

715
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:11.265
But, like, what?
A bodyguard? A life guard?


716
01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:16.168
No, Roberval, it's...
it's nothing like that.


717
01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:21.572
Roberval, don't listen
to anything l say today.


718
01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:26.610
You know what it is?
l've got one of those hangovers,


719
01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:30.098
That hurts right here, you know?

720
01:23:31.542 --> 01:23:35.998
It's because there was this
party at my building yesterday


721
01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:39.505
Yeah, hangovers suck, all right.
They sure do.


722
01:23:40.642 --> 01:23:44.301
Party Was the party good?

723
01:23:46.542 --> 01:23:47.507
It was good.

724
01:23:54.542 --> 01:23:58.496
Clara, don't take this
the wrong way, but,


725
01:24:01.441 --> 01:24:03.303
are you hitting on me?

726
01:24:10.641 --> 01:24:15.504
Roberval, i think you're
a handsome man.


727
01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:23.500
But, you know, there's so much
going on in my head this week


728
01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:28.437
but no, no, i'm not hitting on you
Ah, OK.


729
01:24:29.172 --> 01:24:33.434
It's all good, Clara.
It's just it's good to ask, right?


730
01:24:40.372 --> 01:24:42.672
Where do you live in Rio?

731
01:24:42.672 --> 01:24:45.671
I live in Humaitá, 
Largo dos Leões.

732
01:24:45.671 --> 01:24:48.432
-I know it, love Largo dos Leoes!
-Yeah? lt is nice.


733
01:24:48.972 --> 01:24:52.335
I know it quite well,
Largo dos Leoes.


734
01:24:52.471 --> 01:24:56.028
You know l have a friend, i mean,
I had a friend, she passed away.


735
01:24:56.371 --> 01:25:01.071
She lived right there.
I love that part of Rio de Janeiro.


736
01:25:01.071 --> 01:25:04.470
I like it too. I live on
Mário Pederneiras. Little villeage.


737
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:05.570
I know it.

738
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:08.070
Not even the wretched 'cariocas'

739
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:10.470
have destroyed my
love for Rio.


740
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:12.670
Why? You're not into cariocas'?

741
01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:15.269
-She's pulling your leg, Julia.
-I am joking.


742
01:25:15.269 --> 01:25:17.235
-Silly, would you imagine?
-I get it.


743
01:25:17.469 --> 01:25:19.333
You know what, Julia?
Huh?


744
01:25:19.469 --> 01:25:23.969
It's just that i really like this kid,
you know? He's precious to me.


745
01:25:23.969 --> 01:25:26.169
I think he likes you a lot too.
Yeah?


746
01:25:26.169 --> 01:25:27.465
Because he's told me
all about you.


747
01:25:28.502 --> 01:25:32.866
Sometimes i think i was pregnant
with Tomás and don't remember.


748
01:25:33.501 --> 01:25:36.059
Then, there are those pictures

749
01:25:36.202 --> 01:25:40.901
of his mother in the maternity
ward with that little baby in her arms


750
01:25:40.901 --> 01:25:42.602
It just wrecks my dream.

751
01:25:42.602 --> 01:25:46.102
Aunt, would you debrief
the tourist, please?


752
01:25:46.102 --> 01:25:48.566
Explain to her
All right.


753
01:25:49.101 --> 01:25:51.260
Have you played
her Maria Bethânia?


754
01:25:52.001 --> 01:25:52.558
No.

755
01:25:53.101 --> 01:25:53.862
Maria Bethãnia?

756
01:25:54.101 --> 01:25:55.464
Why haven't you played?

757
01:25:55.601 --> 01:25:59.200
Weren't you going to play her Maria Bethânia?
No, that was her idea.


758
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.962
Tomás, Show her how intense you are.
Check it out, aunt.


759
01:26:03.499 --> 01:26:05.363
Explain to her
where we're headed.


760
01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:12.600
Very well. Here well, here's the divide.
Over there is Pina.


761
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:17.499
And here's kinda the divide. You know how in
Rio there's Leme and Copacabana, right?


762
01:26:17.499 --> 01:26:21.056
-It's kinda the same thing.
-And where's the divide?


763
01:26:21.999 --> 01:26:22.965
It's right here.

764
01:26:23.499 --> 01:26:30.132
This sewage pipe, the outfall,
this pipe is the divide.


765
01:26:30.132 --> 01:26:34.531
On this side of the pipe,
they say it's the rich part,


766
01:26:34.531 --> 01:26:37.232
and on that side, the poor part.

767
01:26:37.232 --> 01:26:42.290
In other words, this way, Pina;
that way, Brasília Teimosa.


768
01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:45.131
I get it.
Got it?


769
01:26:45.131 --> 01:26:47.892
And Brasilia Teimosa is where
we're headed right now.


770
01:26:48.332 --> 01:26:50.796
We're gonna go say hi to Ladjane.

771
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:53.089
She's worked with me for
nineteen years.


772
01:26:53.331 --> 01:26:57.431
And last year
she lost her son


773
01:26:57.431 --> 01:27:01.330
in a motorcycle accident.
He was coming home from work,


774
01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:06.785
and a drunk driver
and nothing came of it!


775
01:27:07.330 --> 01:27:11.930
What do you think? Drunk driver
runs him over, and nothing happens.


776
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:12.896
That's fucked up.

777
01:27:46.061 --> 01:27:47.027
Happy birthday!

778
01:27:49.961 --> 01:27:53.121
I need to talk to you, OK?
You look great!


779
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.060
Happy birthday.
Thank you!


780
01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.860
Ah, Tomás's friend, huh?
Yes.


781
01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.161
From Rio?
Yep.


782
01:27:59.161 --> 01:28:00.760
She's good-looking

783
01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.021
Those Rio girls have
really got it going!


784
01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.324
Oh, Lara, that's so you.
That's right, though!


785
01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.460
Lara is Ladjane's sister.

786
01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.259
Lara works for Leticia,
who is my friend,


787
01:28:12.259 --> 01:28:14.226
and Ladjane works for me.

788
01:28:28.092 --> 01:28:29.149
Say it woman!

789
01:28:29.391 --> 01:28:30.755
Did Paulo tell you
about last night?


790
01:28:31.192 --> 01:28:32.351
No, last night?

791
01:28:32.992 --> 01:28:34.048
No.

792
01:28:34.191 --> 01:28:35.350
Did you call him?

793
01:28:36.091 --> 01:28:37.250
He came over last night.

794
01:28:43.691 --> 01:28:47.851
That's funny.
I really wanted you to be with him...


795
01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:50.853
But i am, actually, jealous now.

796
01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:53.757
Well, it's too late now,
the deed is done, huh?


797
01:28:55.090 --> 01:28:56.057
Was it good?

798
01:28:58.289 --> 01:29:00.755
Yeah, yeah, it was good, but

799
01:29:01.890 --> 01:29:03.856
you know, i'm still processing it

800
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:07.155
It was too good.

801
01:29:19.690 --> 01:29:22.246
Was it good?
Was it not good?


802
01:29:22.689 --> 01:29:24.789
Just tell me...

803
01:29:24.789 --> 01:29:27.153
It was good.

804
01:29:36.988 --> 01:29:39.954
So, aside from the party,

805
01:29:40.788 --> 01:29:41.754
your night was good.

806
01:29:44.888 --> 01:29:45.648
It was.

807
01:29:45.787 --> 01:29:46.844
I think it was.

808
01:29:46.987 --> 01:29:48.887
What are you saying, girl?
You think it was?


809
01:29:48.887 --> 01:29:49.853
Happy Birthday!

810
01:31:45.547 --> 01:31:46.978
You were gorgeous, you hear?

811
01:31:47.247 --> 01:31:51.179
Ah, honey, with that wind

812
01:31:51.247 --> 01:31:54.679
They had to make
a lacquer helmet on me!


813
01:31:55.646 --> 01:31:58.806
You noticed, huh?
Not one loose strand!


814
01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:01.613
-But you were gorgeous.
My coffee.


815
01:32:01.613 --> 01:32:03.146
Good morning, Clara.
Hi!


816
01:32:03.146 --> 01:32:04.476
Gonna get me some water, OK?

817
01:32:04.546 --> 01:32:07.069
We're starting up front.
All right.


818
01:32:07.813 --> 01:32:11.545
I bought all that paint you asked
for, it's all in the car, ok?


819
01:32:11.545 --> 01:32:13.102
Good.
Expensive, huh?


820
01:32:13.513 --> 01:32:14.671
Good paint.

821
01:32:14.812 --> 01:32:18.801
Good but expensivel
The job's gonna look good, though.


822
01:32:19.745 --> 01:32:22.472
Come back for coffee laterl
All right, i will.


823
01:32:27.744 --> 01:32:29.878
The men from the
construction company are here.


824
01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:31.844
They're washing the stairs.

825
01:32:45.177 --> 01:32:47.578
Good morning, Josimar.
Good morning, Rivanildo.


826
01:32:47.578 --> 01:32:48.634
Good morning, Ms. Clara.

827
01:32:49.143 --> 01:32:53.508
There was a lot of shit upstairs.
Have you cleaned it?


828
01:32:53.777 --> 01:32:54.777
Yes.

829
01:32:54.777 --> 01:32:57.576
You've already cleaned
all that shit upstairs?


830
01:32:57.576 --> 01:32:59.804
Yes, Ms. Clara.
Don't worry about it.


831
01:33:00.076 --> 01:33:01.508
Hold on, man

832
01:33:15.475 --> 01:33:17.997
Tomás and Julia
are still asleep.


833
01:33:19.576 --> 01:33:21.007
Let'em sleep in.

834
01:33:22.175 --> 01:33:24.141
I sure miss my son.

835
01:33:27.509 --> 01:33:32.873
Filipe, look, i think here there are lots
of pictures of you when you were little


836
01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:36.837
birthday parties,
that sort of thing, naked


837
01:33:37.407 --> 01:33:41.465
when you were a baby
butt naked, right?


838
01:33:41.807 --> 01:33:43.739
That's right, yeah.

839
01:33:45.006 --> 01:33:46.774
Good times, huh?

840
01:33:46.774 --> 01:33:49.507
Mr. Herculano

841
01:33:49.507 --> 01:33:50.373
Who?

842
01:33:50.373 --> 01:33:50.964
Herculano

843
01:33:54.906 --> 01:33:57.065
-Beautiful! Pregnant
-Cool!


844
01:33:59.373 --> 01:34:01.065
Gorgeous. Look at your mom!

845
01:34:01.972 --> 01:34:03.606
This one looks great too.

846
01:34:03.606 --> 01:34:06.470
-Like those pictures you
see in old picture frames.


847
01:34:07.106 --> 01:34:12.662
Antonio this woman here,
you remember?


848
01:34:13.772 --> 01:34:15.406
What was her name?

849
01:34:15.406 --> 01:34:19.531
She made the most wondertul food.
Everybody loved her, remember?


850
01:34:19.605 --> 01:34:23.060
Turns out she was a cunt
who stole our jewelry


851
01:34:23.605 --> 01:34:25.405
stole jewelry from Mom,

852
01:34:25.405 --> 01:34:26.870
remember?
From Grandma.


853
01:34:27.837 --> 01:34:31.792
This one took off to Ceará,
no one ever saw her since.


854
01:34:31.904 --> 01:34:34.597
Yeah, well, it's inevitable,
isn't it?


855
01:34:36.437 --> 01:34:38.369
We exploit them

856
01:34:39.604 --> 01:34:42.570
They steal from us,
here and there.


857
01:34:43.937 --> 01:34:44.960
And so it goes, huh?

858
01:34:47.037 --> 01:34:48.003
You're right.

859
01:34:49.503 --> 01:34:51.969
Tom, what was her name?

860
01:34:55.304 --> 01:34:56.700
-What?
-Darlene.


861
01:34:58.636 --> 01:34:59.902
Not Darlene!

862
01:34:59.902 --> 01:35:03.357
-Darlene Glória.
-Where'd you pull that from, Darlene?


863
01:35:03.902 --> 01:35:05.299
So how's the long weekend?

864
01:35:08.635 --> 01:35:11.601
-How are you?
-Everything all right?


865
01:35:14.535 --> 01:35:18.902
The records you didn't get
to yesterday are over there.


866
01:35:18.902 --> 01:35:20.834
-Right.
-Over there, see?


867
01:35:20.834 --> 01:35:22.734
-We could go check them out now.
-Yeah, let's.


868
01:35:22.734 --> 01:35:25.302
And do you want sorry?

869
01:35:25.302 --> 01:35:28.668
-My future inheritance.
-Really? Pull up a chair.


870
01:35:28.668 --> 01:35:29.691
-Clara
-yeah?


871
01:35:30.734 --> 01:35:31.722
Hey, Ladjane.

872
01:35:32.834 --> 01:35:33.925
Hey, girl!

873
01:35:36.267 --> 01:35:38.926
So lots of stuff

874
01:35:43.966 --> 01:35:47.330
these from this series
in Maria Farinha


875
01:35:48.567 --> 01:35:49.533
Dad?

876
01:35:50.366 --> 01:35:53.332
What's with people
posing with cars?


877
01:35:54.266 --> 01:35:56.891
I see so many people here
taking pictures with cars.


878
01:35:57.866 --> 01:35:59.729
Cars lost their charm.

879
01:35:59.965 --> 01:36:01.329
Now it's just a car.

880
01:36:01.732 --> 01:36:04.220
I've seen people and cars
on Facebook.


881
01:36:04.966 --> 01:36:06.591
Like in the past?

882
01:36:06.966 --> 01:36:10.795
People posing as if
they were family members?


883
01:36:13.566 --> 01:36:15.497
-Yeah. It's different.

884
01:36:21.731 --> 01:36:24.264
Her name was Juvenita.
Juvenita.


885
01:36:24.264 --> 01:36:26.565
Good thing you remembered.

886
01:36:26.565 --> 01:36:29.164
How long have
you known me, Antonio?


887
01:36:29.164 --> 01:36:30.898
Sixty one years.

888
01:36:30.898 --> 01:36:35.298
If i didn't remember,
I'd go mad all day.


889
01:36:35.298 --> 01:36:38.162
Juvenita, Juvenita.
Good thing i remembered!


890
01:36:38.498 --> 01:36:42.263
I think we have enough photos
for the wedding video.


891
01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:44.797
-That's all?
-Well, we still have my own pictures,


892
01:36:44.797 --> 01:36:47.660
-in my mother's house.
-Oh, i see.


893
01:36:48.496 --> 01:36:51.696
-Isn't this Arnaldo? Adalberto's cousin?
-That is Arnaldo indeed.


894
01:36:51.696 --> 01:36:54.458
The funniest person
I have ever met.


895
01:36:54.863 --> 01:36:55.828
Please, let me see.

896
01:36:57.696 --> 01:36:59.753
-Did you ever meet Arnaldo?
-This one?


897
01:37:00.496 --> 01:37:01.826
He looks so serious.

898
01:37:02.895 --> 01:37:08.396
Yeah, but that day he was
graduating from law school...


899
01:37:08.396 --> 01:37:10.663
He graduated in law.

900
01:37:10.663 --> 01:37:12.651
That was for you, Filipe.

901
01:37:13.395 --> 01:37:15.827
-What's with the lawyer joke?
-Just a silly joke.


902
01:37:16.195 --> 01:37:17.195
I don't get it...

903
01:37:17.195 --> 01:37:19.261
Forget about it.

904
01:37:19.261 --> 01:37:21.694
You better learn how
it works around here.


905
01:37:21.694 --> 01:37:25.457
I might lose a nephew
but i won't miss a joke.


906
01:37:25.695 --> 01:37:27.182
I love you too, Aunt.

907
01:37:28.327 --> 01:37:29.657
I love you too.

908
01:37:30.627 --> 01:37:32.093
That's Aunt Lucia.

909
01:37:34.627 --> 01:37:36.092
The amazing Aunt Lucia.

910
01:37:36.227 --> 01:37:38.227
They don't make
em like her anymore.


911
01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:41.427
-Anybody, more wine?
-Yep, i want some.


912
01:37:41.427 --> 01:37:42.726
-More wine?
-Just a little.


913
01:37:42.726 --> 01:37:45.226
No, thanks.

914
01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:48.750
I'd like to show you the photo
of my son i carry in my wallet.


915
01:37:57.726 --> 01:37:59.554
He's handsome, Ladjane.
-Thank you.


916
01:38:05.792 --> 01:38:09.280
Aunt, we'd like to play
a song that Ju chose.


917
01:38:09.824 --> 01:38:10.791
Is that OK?

918
01:38:11.792 --> 01:38:15.348
You have a lot of stuff here.
I could listen to all of it.


919
01:38:16.091 --> 01:38:19.325
Anyway, this record,
I'm really into it...


920
01:38:19.325 --> 01:38:22.484
...and this isn't even one of
his most popular songs...


921
01:38:22.723 --> 01:38:24.189
...but i think it's really beautiful.

922
01:38:24.424 --> 01:38:25.788
You probably know it.

923
01:38:26.424 --> 01:38:27.724
Put it on, let's hear itl

924
01:38:27.724 --> 01:38:29.314
Play it, Tomás.

Part 3
Clara's Cancer


926
01:40:06.018 --> 01:40:10.713
Hi, Mr. Pedro! Hello, Mr. Pedro!
What's the matter?


927
01:40:12.451 --> 01:40:14.416
Wow, it's hot in here.
Ladjane!


928
01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:21.406
Look who's herel
Mommy'll be right back.


929
01:40:24.217 --> 01:40:25.150
What's the matter?

930
01:40:25.150 --> 01:40:27.343
Mom, it was awful i had
to send Cidinha away.


931
01:40:28.984 --> 01:40:30.142
You sent Cidinha away.

932
01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:31.284
Aw, Mom, she was great

933
01:40:31.284 --> 01:40:34.950
The Super no, the Supernanny;
loves Pedro.


934
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:36.584
You sent her away;
now you don't have a nanny?


935
01:40:36.584 --> 01:40:39.283
I've got my eye on someone else; have had
for a while now; it'll be better for everybody.


936
01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:40.650
Mom, i'm, i'm really
in a hurry


937
01:40:40.650 --> 01:40:43.249
Honey, did you talk
to Armando about this?


938
01:40:43.249 --> 01:40:45.583
Mom, Armando is not part of
Pedro's daily life. He doesn't know


939
01:40:45.583 --> 01:40:49.106
Heck, he probably won't even notice
the nanny changed, you know?


940
01:40:49.682 --> 01:40:54.341
Mom, here you've got diapers, you've
got his food, his book, everything.


941
01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:56.641
Just hand it over
to Ladjane, okay?


942
01:40:57.448 --> 01:41:01.249
Cover this one for me, OK?
Call me if you need me!


943
01:41:01.249 --> 01:41:04.510
Of course, i'll call,
but what's the point? Bye.


944
01:41:10.381 --> 01:41:12.643
Where's the ocean, Pedro?

945
01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:59.139
-Good morning.
-Good morning.


946
01:42:08.011 --> 01:42:10.477
I'm the big bad wolf, the big
bad wolf, the big bad wolf.


947
01:42:11.311 --> 01:42:13.833
Three little pigs

948
01:42:14.111 --> 01:42:17.311
No, right?
Walls come crumbling down no.


949
01:42:17.311 --> 01:42:20.936
Lookie here!
Little Red Riding Hood.


950
01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:27.103
Little Red Riding Hood Pedro,
the wolf devours grandma.


951
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:32.401
Edilene went to the market. When she
gets back, i'll have her give it to me.


952
01:42:32.943 --> 01:42:35.102
I can't do that stuff.
Yes.


953
01:42:35.343 --> 01:42:37.442
But when she gets back,
I'll have her do it.


954
01:42:37.442 --> 01:42:40.806
Right, now you
Sorry, lady!


955
01:42:44.343 --> 01:42:47.308
Hey, mister, what gives?
You trying to kill me?


956
01:43:08.008 --> 01:43:10.407
Make way for the baby carriage
to come through Good morningl


957
01:43:10.407 --> 01:43:12.464
-Good morning.
-Good morning.


958
01:43:44.872 --> 01:43:48.305
God is beautiful!
He is marvelous to us.


959
01:43:54.472 --> 01:43:56.029
God is soverein.

960
01:44:04.272 --> 01:44:05.237
What is going on?

961
01:44:30.203 --> 01:44:31.669
Excuse me.

962
01:44:34.403 --> 01:44:36.164
I don't know what to say.

963
01:44:37.169 --> 01:44:41.330
Did you see what it's like
in the garage? Come see!


964
01:45:43.199 --> 01:45:44.165
Ms. Clara?

965
01:45:46.999 --> 01:45:47.964
Ms. Clara.

966
01:45:50.999 --> 01:45:52.965
There's something
i wanted to tell you.


967
01:45:54.798 --> 01:45:57.957
It may be nothing,
but l don't think so.


968
01:45:58.131 --> 01:46:01.564
Yesterday, after you left
to take Pedro for his walk,


969
01:46:02.131 --> 01:46:03.062
Yesterday?

970
01:46:04.130 --> 01:46:08.086
If it happened yesterday,
why are you only telling me now?


971
01:47:01.127 --> 01:47:03.628
The matresses were disgusting.

972
01:47:03.628 --> 01:47:06.219
When i got there the matresses
were still half burned.


973
01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:12.627
Please tell me what this is.

974
01:47:12.627 --> 01:47:14.060
-Are you insane?
-Stay out of it.


975
01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:16.923
How can you do this
in the middle of Boa Viagem?


976
01:47:44.492 --> 01:47:47.457
How are you, Clara?

977
01:47:48.057 --> 01:47:49.024
Fine, Diego.

978
01:47:50.191 --> 01:47:52.749
Fixin' to get better.
What happened?


979
01:47:54.591 --> 01:48:00.991
Diego, did you have some
mattresses burned out here in the yard?


980
01:48:00.991 --> 01:48:02.150
In the middle of Boa Viagem?

981
01:48:02.892 --> 01:48:05.050
No, i didn't.
What, that over there?


982
01:48:05.191 --> 01:48:06.891
They burnt em. I saw itl

983
01:48:06.891 --> 01:48:08.057
I don't know anything about that

984
01:48:08.057 --> 01:48:09.114
The remains, over there?

985
01:48:09.991 --> 01:48:12.690
Look, i'll find out
who did this and chem them out.


986
01:48:12.690 --> 01:48:14.553
You're absolutely right.
This is not right.


987
01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:19.744
You know there was a party
here in the building


988
01:48:20.489 --> 01:48:23.649
And the mattresses must
have gotten really dirty.


989
01:48:23.789 --> 01:48:27.623
I know about the party, but i was not
aware of any dirty mattresses


990
01:48:27.623 --> 01:48:30.789
Oh yes, there were
dirty mattresses.


991
01:48:30.789 --> 01:48:33.346
There was even
shit on the stairs.


992
01:48:33.923 --> 01:48:35.989
Why are you laughing?
Didn't you have the stairs washed?


993
01:48:35.989 --> 01:48:38.788
The shit on the stairs? i admit.
i didn't know about shit on the stairs.


994
01:48:38.788 --> 01:48:41.686
No, but it's OK,
I'm not judging.


995
01:48:41.822 --> 01:48:44.921
That's not why i'm here talking to you.
Here's the thing:


996
01:48:44.921 --> 01:48:49.122
You have so many apartments
in this building, right?


997
01:48:49.122 --> 01:48:52.921
You could have had a party
in any one of your apartments.


998
01:48:52.921 --> 01:48:57.388
But no, you had to throw a party
exactly in apartment 8,


999
01:48:57.388 --> 01:49:00.721
which is right above mine,
and didn't even let me know.


1000
01:49:00.721 --> 01:49:03.021
I'm sorry, you're right,
that's my


1001
01:49:03.021 --> 01:49:04.987
I had a lot on my mind,
I wound up forgetting.


1002
01:49:05.821 --> 01:49:10.020
I promise you that any parties
I throw or allow here in the building,


1003
01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:12.020
from now on, I'll let you know
beforehand. I'm sorry.


1004
01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:16.019
Now, Clara, l see you're
painting the façade


1005
01:49:16.019 --> 01:49:19.679
without discussing that
with the construction company?


1006
01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:22.348
We're also part of the condominium.

1007
01:49:22.486 --> 01:49:24.974
I think we can improve
our communication skills.


1008
01:49:25.719 --> 01:49:30.049
Diego, you play that
passive-aggressive type.


1009
01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:31.482
What's that?

1010
01:49:32.819 --> 01:49:34.375
Passive-aggressive.

1011
01:49:35.619 --> 01:49:37.983
No, Clara, I play the focused type.

1012
01:49:38.619 --> 01:49:40.619
The determined type.
lt's that you don't know me.


1013
01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:42.118
I just got back from the US.

1014
01:49:42.118 --> 01:49:44.919
I graduated there;
I studied business for three years,


1015
01:49:44.919 --> 01:49:47.440
and now i'm back, ready to fight.

1016
01:49:47.718 --> 01:49:49.618
This is under my responsibility

1017
01:49:49.618 --> 01:49:52.743
and i'm going to do whatever
it takes to reach my goal.


1018
01:49:53.018 --> 01:49:57.384
That visit we paid to your house,
that was very social, wasn't it?


1019
01:49:57.384 --> 01:50:00.976
You know, ''let's get close to Clara,
let's make contact.''


1020
01:50:01.417 --> 01:50:02.677
And that didn't happen.

1021
01:50:02.783 --> 01:50:06.045
Because, you know, you didn't
let us in; we were in the hall.


1022
01:50:06.617 --> 01:50:11.345
Nobody offered us coffee,
water, tea...


1023
01:50:12.383 --> 01:50:15.577
I wish i had given you a more
realistic take about all this.


1024
01:50:17.617 --> 01:50:19.343
This building's empty, Clara.

1025
01:50:20.883 --> 01:50:21.849
No.

1026
01:50:22.582 --> 01:50:24.716
The building's not empty;
I'm here, i live here.


1027
01:50:24.716 --> 01:50:26.705
-It's not empty.
Yes, but the building's empty.


1028
01:50:27.449 --> 01:50:30.574
The building's empty and i,
everyone at the company is worried


1029
01:50:30.916 --> 01:50:33.849
about someone, pardon me,
your age.


1030
01:50:33.849 --> 01:50:36.507
I wouldn't leave my grandmother,
my mother live alone here.


1031
01:50:37.415 --> 01:50:37.848
In Brazil.

1032
01:50:37.848 --> 01:50:39.815
Where do your mother
and grandmother live?


1033
01:50:39.815 --> 01:50:41.805
They live in the kind of place
where you should live.


1034
01:50:41.915 --> 01:50:43.448
-They've got infrastructure, support.
Look, i'm not...


1035
01:50:43.448 --> 01:50:45.948
even going to say
what i'm thinking,


1036
01:50:45.948 --> 01:50:49.048
because that leads me to wonder
where does your mother live?


1037
01:50:49.048 --> 01:50:49.979
You'll excuse me.

1038
01:50:50.714 --> 01:50:53.805
I'm a polite person, but
you really get my goat.


1039
01:50:53.914 --> 01:50:56.506
Right. I don't think living here
is sustainable any longer.


1040
01:50:56.947 --> 01:51:00.714
I just think an educated person like
yourself needs to be in a safe building.


1041
01:51:00.714 --> 01:51:03.874
With cameras around the clock,
with quality, with security.


1042
01:51:04.747 --> 01:51:05.713
This isn't working
any more, Clara.


1043
01:51:07.046 --> 01:51:09.876
I confess l walk in here, I don't
even see this building any more.


1044
01:51:10.514 --> 01:51:15.013
All i can think of is the number of
bricklayers, workers, family members


1045
01:51:15.013 --> 01:51:19.911
who call me everyday to ask if Ms.
Clara has finally made the right decision


1046
01:51:20.313 --> 01:51:22.645
so they can all make it to the end of
the month a little better off, that's all.


1047
01:51:22.645 --> 01:51:27.346
Has it crossed your mind that

1048
01:51:27.346 --> 01:51:31.645
this project of yours, the new Aquarius,
will only see the light of day


1049
01:51:31.645 --> 01:51:34.839
when you're 50, 60 years old?

1050
01:51:36.678 --> 01:51:39.644
That's possible. Maybe.

1051
01:51:40.845 --> 01:51:42.811
-Now there's people that don't think like that.
Oh yeah?


1052
01:51:43.478 --> 01:51:44.545
Yeah, your kids

1053
01:51:44.545 --> 01:51:47.806
Don't you talk about my kids!
Any of them!


1054
01:51:47.878 --> 01:51:49.344
Shut your mouth!

1055
01:51:51.245 --> 01:51:52.710
Do not talk about my kids!

1056
01:51:58.677 --> 01:52:00.336
I'm gonna tell you something.

1057
01:52:00.777 --> 01:52:03.344
I'm standing here wasting
my time talking to you,


1058
01:52:03.344 --> 01:52:05.242
but i'm thinking of
something, you know?


1059
01:52:06.444 --> 01:52:11.543
It's impressive, what people
say about the lack of education


1060
01:52:11.543 --> 01:52:13.634
and they always refer to poor people.

1061
01:52:14.443 --> 01:52:17.643
But the lack of manners
isn't in poor people.


1062
01:52:17.643 --> 01:52:20.631
It's in rich, well educated
people like you, you know?


1063
01:52:20.976 --> 01:52:24.576
The elite, who think they're elite,
who think they're privileged,


1064
01:52:24.576 --> 01:52:26.268
who don't stand in line,
you know?


1065
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:28.675
People like you

1066
01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:34.766
who took a ''business'' course,
but lack basic human decency.


1067
01:52:34.908 --> 01:52:38.272
Who have no character, you know?
No character.


1068
01:52:38.575 --> 01:52:41.541
No i mean, you do have character;
your character is money.


1069
01:52:41.875 --> 01:52:44.340
Therefore, honey,
you have no character.


1070
01:52:44.808 --> 01:52:47.331
All you've got is your shit-eating smile;
that's what you've got.


1071
01:52:47.808 --> 01:52:49.365
I'm gonna tell you something.

1072
01:52:49.475 --> 01:52:51.769
I've told you once;
I'll tell you again.


1073
01:52:53.174 --> 01:52:54.572
I am not kidding.

1074
01:52:54.907 --> 01:52:57.271
I will only leave here dead!

1075
01:52:59.874 --> 01:53:01.430
You don't know me, Clara.

1076
01:53:03.507 --> 01:53:06.371
But you're right, I would rather
listen and respect you


1077
01:53:08.173 --> 01:53:09.662
because from where i'm looking,

1078
01:53:10.607 --> 01:53:15.436
I can tell you come from a family
that fought hard to get to where they did.


1079
01:53:15.706 --> 01:53:17.366
Right, Clara?

1080
01:53:17.672 --> 01:53:20.434
A darker-skinned family,
right?


1081
01:53:20.772 --> 01:53:23.761
That had to sweat a lot
to get what they got.


1082
01:53:24.172 --> 01:53:25.069
I respect you.

1083
01:53:31.705 --> 01:53:33.538
You'll excuse me, sir.

1084
01:53:33.538 --> 01:53:36.800
But you cannot treat her this way.

1085
01:53:59.737 --> 01:54:02.100
-Good that you came.
-I'm here,


1086
01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:06.392
-Long time no see.
-That was a great cinema.


1087
01:54:08.637 --> 01:54:09.567
Look.

1088
01:54:10.102 --> 01:54:12.236
Have you seen this?

1089
01:54:12.236 --> 01:54:16.536
It finally came out.

1090
01:54:16.536 --> 01:54:17.592
Right here.

1091
01:54:20.703 --> 01:54:23.498
I love MP3'.
You must have said that.


1092
01:54:23.603 --> 01:54:25.431
Bad title, horrible photo.

1093
01:54:30.269 --> 01:54:32.201
It's been ages since
we came to Leite's.


1094
01:54:41.267 --> 01:54:43.324
Do you know anything
about these people?


1095
01:54:44.268 --> 01:54:47.029
What i know, Clara...

1096
01:54:48.068 --> 01:54:51.033
is their advertising
budget at the paper.


1097
01:54:51.567 --> 01:54:55.329
In advertising, honey, they're behind
only the state government,


1098
01:54:56.234 --> 01:54:57.221
City Hall,

1099
01:54:57.766 --> 01:55:00.766
and their competitors,
Pinto Engineering.


1100
01:55:00.766 --> 01:55:02.067
They're powerful people.

1101
01:55:02.067 --> 01:55:04.124
Yeah, but we know
that already, don't we?


1102
01:55:06.166 --> 01:55:10.098
Diego, the grandson. What do you
know about him?


1103
01:55:10.566 --> 01:55:16.725
Oh, him. Almost everyone knows
about him, because he's vain.


1104
01:55:17.066 --> 01:55:21.327
He likes being in the papers,
he's got a press agent


1105
01:55:23.165 --> 01:55:27.962
He's always in the paper.
Havent' you been reading the paper?


1106
01:55:28.965 --> 01:55:30.598
No, i don't read
the paper any more.


1107
01:55:30.598 --> 01:55:33.599
You are joking.
You don't read our paper anymore?


1108
01:55:33.599 --> 01:55:35.224
No, i don't read the paper.

1109
01:55:36.565 --> 01:55:38.553
So you know, this kid...

1110
01:55:40.664 --> 01:55:43.960
he's involved in a church.

1111
01:55:49.698 --> 01:55:50.958
A church?

1112
01:55:55.997 --> 01:56:01.951
Diego is my brother Ricardo's godson.
The architect, you know.


1113
01:56:07.196 --> 01:56:08.957
Diego is family.

1114
01:56:15.497 --> 01:56:17.362
You're being

1115
01:56:17.362 --> 01:56:18.952
sarcastic.

1116
01:56:19.462 --> 01:56:20.995
There's something else, Ricardo...

1117
01:56:20.995 --> 01:56:24.654
Ricardo has done several projects
for the construction company.


1118
01:56:24.895 --> 01:56:27.329
He's an architect, it's
only natural, Clara...


1119
01:56:27.329 --> 01:56:30.129
It's natural and logical.

1120
01:56:30.129 --> 01:56:34.493
The extension of familial ties to
friendly, social circles


1121
01:56:35.094 --> 01:56:38.995
Isn't it, Ronaldo?
This is so Pernambuco


1122
01:56:38.995 --> 01:56:40.960
This is so Brazil.

1123
01:56:41.128 --> 01:56:43.027
Isn't it, Ronaldo Cavalcanti?

1124
01:56:43.027 --> 01:56:46.187
If you're not Cavalcanti,
you are a ''CavalCan't''.


1125
01:56:47.328 --> 01:56:49.452
I want to ask you something...

1126
01:56:49.926 --> 01:56:53.093
That girl who came to
interview me. ls she family?


1127
01:56:53.093 --> 01:56:54.393
Ana Paula?

1128
01:56:54.393 --> 01:56:56.483
She's my niece.
She's with us at the newspaper.


1129
01:56:58.893 --> 01:57:01.553
Let's not discuss family,
because...


1130
01:57:03.427 --> 01:57:09.381
you're little brother's involved
in some ugly stuff, politically. You see?


1131
01:57:10.193 --> 01:57:15.386
Yes, Ronaldo, if they can prove all
the accusations, he's in a lot of trouble.


1132
01:57:17.226 --> 01:57:18.192
I am sorry.

1133
01:57:18.392 --> 01:57:22.346
Sorry sorry, i shouldn't
even have brought it up


1134
01:57:26.259 --> 01:57:28.224
How do you put up with it, huh?

1135
01:57:31.824 --> 01:57:35.780
I think i'm still in media
all these years, because...


1136
01:57:37.524 --> 01:57:40.116
a lot of people know
i know about too many things.


1137
01:57:41.125 --> 01:57:43.091
i've seen a lot of things

1138
01:57:45.257 --> 01:57:47.120
I have sifted through
too much information.


1139
01:57:52.323 --> 01:57:54.812
I have a feeling you're
about to help me.


1140
01:57:59.524 --> 01:58:00.988
Very discretely.

1141
01:58:02.456 --> 01:58:04.081
There are some papers

1142
01:58:07.856 --> 01:58:11.413
that, if they were to come to light,
not in my paper, obviously,


1143
01:58:11.956 --> 01:58:15.411
but, if they were
to come to light


1144
01:58:16.555 --> 01:58:19.419
it would be bad for them.

1145
01:58:23.355 --> 01:58:26.150
Now, you like it.

1146
01:58:29.955 --> 01:58:31.852
Alright.

1147
01:58:57.786 --> 01:59:00.086
Good morning
Mrs. Cleide?


1148
01:59:00.086 --> 01:59:02.887
That's me, Mrs. Cleide,
this is my client Clara.


1149
01:59:02.887 --> 01:59:04.252
Nice to meet you.
Benedito


1150
01:59:04.252 --> 01:59:06.411
Thanks for seeing us, Benedito.

1151
01:59:06.953 --> 01:59:08.418
The information i was given

1152
01:59:08.986 --> 01:59:12.042
is that it's in Allotment 307
-D.

1153
01:59:27.385 --> 01:59:29.941
I may look lost because...

1154
01:59:30.184 --> 01:59:32.150
That's what i am.

1155
01:59:36.283 --> 01:59:38.943
This is paper sewage.

1156
01:59:59.882 --> 02:00:02.849
Unfortunately it's there,
in that mess over there.


1157
02:00:05.382 --> 02:00:07.939
I figured it couldn't
be that easy


1158
02:02:47.673 --> 02:02:49.639
You're bleeding, ma'am.

1159
02:03:20.838 --> 02:03:24.505
-Hello Look who's here.
-Where's Pedro?


1160
02:03:24.505 --> 02:03:28.527
Pedro
Where are you, Pedro?


1161
02:03:29.104 --> 02:03:30.904
Where's Pedro's football?
Give me Pedro's ball.


1162
02:03:30.904 --> 02:03:32.836
Here's the football, Pedro.

1163
02:03:33.004 --> 02:03:35.764
And how's your mother doing,
Pedro?


1164
02:03:36.803 --> 02:03:37.928
-fine, Mother.
-You're fine?


1165
02:03:38.504 --> 02:03:40.470
Hi, Ladjane.

1166
02:03:41.504 --> 02:03:44.060
Getting better,
with your help.


1167
02:03:45.203 --> 02:03:49.965
I was handed this envelope, downstairs.
Had to sign for it.


1168
02:03:54.503 --> 02:03:55.103
What does it say?

1169
02:03:55.103 --> 02:03:57.467
''Notice''

1170
02:04:03.103 --> 02:04:09.168
''absolutely prohibited to paint
the building's façade''


1171
02:04:09.168 --> 02:04:10.963
Did you paint the façade?

1172
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:17.067
She never noticed
i had the façade painted.


1173
02:04:19.501 --> 02:04:24.956
Mother, i got out of the car,
Pedro, bags, in a hurry i didn't


1174
02:04:25.734 --> 02:04:27.996
I'll take a look now,
when i leave.


1175
02:04:28.634 --> 02:04:30.433
'' designated for arbitration''

1176
02:04:30.433 --> 02:04:32.533
Isn't Cleide your lawyer?

1177
02:04:32.533 --> 02:04:34.533
Yeah, she is my lawyer.

1178
02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:35.692
Give her a call.

1179
02:04:36.434 --> 02:04:39.887
This probably won't go anywhere,
but give her a call.


1180
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.390
I gotta go.

1181
02:04:44.934 --> 02:04:47.833
Look, just another week and
things'll be back to normal.


1182
02:04:47.833 --> 02:04:48.890
No problem.

1183
02:04:49.499 --> 02:04:50.692
Thank you.

1184
02:04:51.033 --> 02:04:53.692
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-No problem.


1185
02:06:02.062 --> 02:06:03.426
Ms. Clara!

1186
02:06:04.062 --> 02:06:06.027
I don't know if you
remember us, ma'am.


1187
02:06:07.061 --> 02:06:09.721
I remember. You're Josimar,
from the construction company.


1188
02:06:10.061 --> 02:06:12.562
My name is Josimar, but i'm
not with the construction company.


1189
02:06:12.562 --> 02:06:15.823
We left. We don't work for the
construction company any more.


1190
02:06:16.461 --> 02:06:19.916
I thought i should come
here and talk to you.


1191
02:06:21.661 --> 02:06:22.819
All right, go ahead.

1192
02:06:23.561 --> 02:06:25.857
I wanted to tell you...

1193
02:06:26.794 --> 02:06:28.259
I really admire you,

1194
02:06:28.594 --> 02:06:30.752
I think you're
very decent...


1195
02:06:31.893 --> 02:06:34.553
...and a beautiful woman.

1196
02:06:36.893 --> 02:06:40.757
Josimar you're drunk.

1197
02:06:41.493 --> 02:06:43.693
I did have a little bit to drink
a little bit.


1198
02:06:43.693 --> 02:06:49.293
But i didn't drink, and what we're
trying to do here is help you, ma'am.


1199
02:06:49.293 --> 02:06:50.593
I know you're scared

1200
02:06:50.593 --> 02:06:52.393
We came to say something
for your own good.


1201
02:06:52.393 --> 02:06:54.756
Some three, four months ago

1202
02:06:55.892 --> 02:06:58.357
You were away.

1203
02:07:00.293 --> 02:07:01.591
You were away...

1204
02:07:01.591 --> 02:07:02.891
-Mm-hmm.

1205
02:07:02.891 --> 02:07:06.692
And they had us do a job here,
at your building.


1206
02:07:06.692 --> 02:07:09.691
And it wasn't just us, it was
everybody from the company.


1207
02:07:09.691 --> 02:07:12.748
All the workers who were
working on the building


1208
02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:16.392
They had us bring some material,
and we were on this crew, weren't we?


1209
02:07:16.392 --> 02:07:18.448
And what material
was this, Josimar?


1210
02:07:21.791 --> 02:07:24.586
You need to open up
the upstairs apartments.


1211
02:07:24.924 --> 02:07:26.924
Over in Block B, that area
where the electricity's out.


1212
02:07:26.924 --> 02:07:28.890
-No electricty.
-Ten. Apartment ten.


1213
02:07:29.423 --> 02:07:32.390
Apartments ten and
twelve.


1214
02:07:33.223 --> 02:07:34.689
But what exactly happened?

1215
02:07:34.823 --> 02:07:37.523
We've told you everything we could.

1216
02:07:37.523 --> 02:07:40.423
Now you go up to those apartments,
open them up, and you'll see.


1217
02:07:40.423 --> 02:07:41.422
Open up those apartments.

1218
02:07:41.422 --> 02:07:42.388
See what's in there.

1219
02:07:42.923 --> 02:07:45.480
-We're leaving now, OK?
-No.


1220
02:07:45.622 --> 02:07:48.822
What did you bring, what did
they have delivered, and where?


1221
02:07:48.822 --> 02:07:51.186
You're going to
tell me right now.


1222
02:07:51.622 --> 02:07:52.781
Tell her.

1223
02:07:59.322 --> 02:08:00.548
Ladjane!

1224
02:09:00.751 --> 02:09:03.452
Kick it, kick the ball,
there's Grandma!


1225
02:09:03.452 --> 02:09:04.251
Pedro

1226
02:09:04.251 --> 02:09:05.410
C'mon, Pedro,
let's go find Mother.


1227
02:10:36.479 --> 02:10:38.445
-Ms. Clara.
-Hello, Roberval.


1228
02:10:40.246 --> 02:10:43.235
-Thanks for coming, really.
-It's nothing. I'm here to help.


1229
02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:46.036
I think we should
start around here


1230
02:10:46.679 --> 02:10:48.338
now, there's no power.

1231
02:10:49.179 --> 02:10:54.134
Now, Ms. Clara, do you have some
kind of warrant, some document?


1232
02:10:54.278 --> 02:10:56.744
I'm Clara's lawyer;
I take full responsibility.


1233
02:11:00.078 --> 02:11:01.339
Well, then let's get to it.

1234
02:11:01.478 --> 02:11:04.035
I'm not going. I'm not
going up there. No way.


1235
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:26.169
Is this the one?

1236
02:11:27.010 --> 02:11:28.169
Is it this one, Ms. Clara?

1237
02:11:28.410 --> 02:11:30.010
That's the one.

1238
02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:32.066
Would you all move
back a bit, please?


1239
02:11:34.309 --> 02:11:36.275
This will be easy.

1240
02:11:56.507 --> 02:11:58.167
Holy shit.

1241
02:11:59.108 --> 02:12:01.074
Ms. Clara, l think it's better
if you didn't come in here.


1242
02:12:03.008 --> 02:12:04.473
I'm going in.

1243
02:12:05.407 --> 02:12:07.033
You with me?

1244
02:12:41.639 --> 02:12:44.900
The termites were brought
here from some demolition.


1245
02:13:18.236 --> 02:13:21.203
Would you look at that
Bastards...


1246
02:13:50.169 --> 02:13:51.828
Holy shit.

1247
02:14:00.368 --> 02:14:01.968
This one's got more.

1248
02:14:01.968 --> 02:14:03.024
Yep, it's got more.

1249
02:14:03.967 --> 02:14:06.024
Ms. Clara, this one's even worse.

1250
02:14:08.268 --> 02:14:11.233
They brought a whole
colony of termites, look.


1251
02:15:29.730 --> 02:15:32.354
You want me to talk, or
would you rather do it yourself?


1252
02:15:33.729 --> 02:15:34.695
I'll speak.

1253
02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:35.225
Make yourselves comfortable;
they'll be with you soon.


1254
02:16:54.857 --> 02:16:57.914
-Good morning, good morning.
-Good morning.


1255
02:17:01.624 --> 02:17:04.284
-Good morning.
-Fixing to travel?


1256
02:17:04.358 --> 02:17:06.157
To what do we owe the honor?

1257
02:17:06.157 --> 02:17:08.756
-This is my brother Antonio,
-Nice to meet you, Antonio.


1258
02:17:08.756 --> 02:17:10.357
-my nephew Tomás,
-How are you?


1259
02:17:10.357 --> 02:17:14.311
And this is Cleide,
friend and lawyer.


1260
02:17:16.756 --> 02:17:18.222
Shall we sit?

1261
02:17:19.856 --> 02:17:21.616
will be brief

1262
02:17:22.156 --> 02:17:27.555
this is about these documents
that Cleide and i found


1263
02:17:28.189 --> 02:17:30.552
and which may be
of interest to you.


1264
02:17:39.988 --> 02:17:43.989
-Can i see, Grampa?
-Where did you find these, Ms. Clara?


1265
02:17:43.989 --> 02:17:48.148
-I
-You Let me tell you something.


1266
02:17:49.687 --> 02:17:51.988
-I just wanted to say
-No, just wait a minute.


1267
02:17:51.988 --> 02:17:54.146
-Would you like to tell me
-You only need to know one thing


1268
02:17:54.287 --> 02:17:58.888
Would you like to tell me what is
the meaning of this? You know why?


1269
02:17:58.888 --> 02:18:03.853
Because i'm a well-mannered person,
but if i wasn't, i'd kick you out right now.


1270
02:18:03.853 --> 02:18:05.944
-What, over this?
-Exactly.


1271
02:18:06.987 --> 02:18:08.647
Take a look!

1272
02:18:11.286 --> 02:18:12.946
I have the originals.

1273
02:18:14.787 --> 02:18:15.946
Can i see, Grampa?

1274
02:18:20.186 --> 02:18:23.243
Ms. Clara, i wasn't even
born when this happened.


1275
02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:24.850
This won't go anywhere.

1276
02:18:25.819 --> 02:18:28.751
There are things that
don't go anywhere, but


1277
02:18:29.719 --> 02:18:35.185
if it causes you one single headache
when i publish these documents


1278
02:18:35.185 --> 02:18:36.674
I'll be happy.

1279
02:18:36.918 --> 02:18:40.218
Ms. Clara, i don't know if it's in your
best interests, or in those of your lawyer,


1280
02:18:40.218 --> 02:18:42.581
to tangle with
our legal department.


1281
02:18:42.918 --> 02:18:48.782
Well, based on the size of your table,
your legal department must be huge


1282
02:18:48.918 --> 02:18:50.518
You people are complete bastards.

1283
02:18:50.518 --> 02:18:54.718
What is this, kid? You losing
your sense of decency?


1284
02:18:54.718 --> 02:18:57.717
You think this is, what?
You're not at home.


1285
02:18:57.717 --> 02:19:00.717
Respect me, or i'll lose
respect for you.


1286
02:19:00.717 --> 02:19:02.478
-Calm down, Mr. Geraldo.
-Calm down my ass! Speak!


1287
02:19:02.617 --> 02:19:04.518
You're being disrespectful
in my own house.


1288
02:19:04.518 --> 02:19:05.675
Say it.

1289
02:19:06.717 --> 02:19:08.478
The second thing

1290
02:19:08.916 --> 02:19:14.473
I survived cancer. More than 30
years ago, you know?


1291
02:19:14.816 --> 02:19:18.078
And these days, I've
been thinking about something.


1292
02:19:19.183 --> 02:19:23.774
I'd rather give you cancer
than having it myself.


1293
02:19:26.215 --> 02:19:27.875
Antonio, help me here.

1294
02:19:34.516 --> 02:19:35.675
What is this, Clara?

1295
02:19:35.915 --> 02:19:38.515
-Turn off that camera!
-Take it easy.


1296
02:19:38.515 --> 02:19:41.515
-Go ahead, you can film this.
-Turn off that camera now!


1297
02:19:41.515 --> 02:19:43.481
Tomás, keep shooting, Tomás.
