00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:43.123
<i>Instant Swamp</i>

2
00:00:43.223 --> 00:00:46.525
<i>I awake each morning thinking,
"Today's the day!"</i>


3
00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:49.303
<i>And go to bed disappointed.</i>

4
00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:54.116
<i>The day starts early in the city.
But not for me, Haname Jinchoge.</i>


5
00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:57.027
<i>Mine begins with a cup of Milo sludge.</i>

6
00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:02.057
<i>The rooster used to crow at dawn.
Now dawn comes when the rooster crows.</i>


7
00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:04.810
<i>Fools enter the workforce as fools.</i>

8
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.980
<i>Where we're manhandled and manipulated.</i>

9
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.931
<i>With little rest.</i>

10
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.030
I wanna scream!

11
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.686
I wanna scream!

12
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:14.519
<i>Should I lose control?</i>

13
00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:15.695
<i>Or seek order?</i>

14
00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:16.788
<i>Lose control?</i>

15
00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:18.248
<i>Or seek order?</i>

16
00:01:18.523 --> 00:01:20.625
<i>Either way. 
I'm off to work.</i>

17
00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:22.477
<i>I try to quit.</i>

18
00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:23.612
<i>But...</i>

19
00:01:23.712 --> 00:01:24.963
<i>I'm powerless.</i>

20
00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:26.565
<i>So I bury myself in the job.</i>

21
00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:27.676
<i>And...</i>

22
00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:29.109
<i>get ridiculed for it.</i>

23
00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.561
<i>Another monotone day...</i>

24
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:32.971
<i>in a monochrome life.</i>

25
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:34.281
<i>I need some color.</i>

26
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:34.993
<i>Hey!</i>

27
00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:38.669
<i>Some drama. 
A touch of danger.</i>

28
00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:39.619
<i>Not really.</i>

29
00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.364
<i>I long to stray from the beaten path.</i>

30
00:01:42.464 --> 00:01:45.993
<i>But alas, my life's
dull and for the birds.</i>


31
00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:49.421
<i>That said, even they take exception.</i>

32
00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:50.489
Just run!

33
00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:53.533
<i>That's the message in
a lot of independent movies.</i>


34
00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:56.536
<i>But it doesn't work in real life.</i>

35
00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:58.472
Who cares? Just run!

36
00:01:58.572 --> 00:02:01.266
<i>I'm tired of fighting over men.</i>

37
00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:05.354
<i>Love shouldn't have to be
such a crap shoot.</i>


38
00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:07.522
<i>That's a "crap squat."</i>

39
00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:11.868
<i>Nevertheless, that doesn't mean
I'm happy doing nothing.</i>


40
00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:16.448
<i>All I need is a spoonful of happiness
and 10 spoonfuls of Milo.</i>


41
00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:19.951
<i>5, 6, 7, 8, 9...</i>

42
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.762
<i>Oops, 10.</i>

43
00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:25.732
<i>Mixed with 12cc's of milk.</i>

44
00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:31.012
<i>Stir to get "Milo sludge."
There's no other name for it!</i>


45
00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:34.866
<i>Let's leave aside the question of
"Why Milo sludge"?</i>


46
00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:38.019
<i>And simply say I've drunk it
since I was 3.</i>


47
00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.940
<i>A day without Milo is a day
without "Milo sludge".</i>


48
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.883
<i>Even so...</i>

49
00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:45.594
<i>it's not the end of the world.</i>

50
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.205
<i>Tomorrow is another day.</i>

51
00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:49.873
Good morning.

52
00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:56.037
<i>I can't tell the world what to do.
But I can start my day with Milo sludge.</i>


53
00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:03.119
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning, Haname.


54
00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.032
Let us begin.

55
00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:10.054
One, two...

56
00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:13.013
Yes!

57
00:03:14.856 --> 00:03:16.283
Say something.

58
00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.948
Hey! Look at this!

59
00:03:21.223 --> 00:03:22.924
That man looks just like Dvorak?

60
00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:23.899
Who?

61
00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.694
That criminal!
He looks like Dvorak.


62
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:29.046
Let me see.

63
00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:34.075
<i>- Lassoes in front of Gotanda station!!
- Aw, you missed it!</i>


64
00:03:34.225 --> 00:03:38.104
You never look when I tell you to.

65
00:03:38.204 --> 00:03:39.764
But I couldn't help it.

66
00:03:39.864 --> 00:03:45.295
You're slow.
You were born 5 seconds too slow.


67
00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:46.913
Yeah, whatever.

68
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:53.253
That must be it. 
That's why you're

69
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.898
You dawdled in the cervix, too.

70
00:03:56.998 --> 00:03:59.626
Nice morning talk, Ma.

71
00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:04.164
Missing Dvorak doesn't trouble me
in the least.


72
00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:07.637
You never see the critical stuff.

73
00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:09.337
What critical stuff?

74
00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.173
You ever seen a ghost, or a UFO?
Well, I have.


75
00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:14.674
Sure you have.

76
00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:19.187
You know what, a monster once appeared
in a swamp by your grandma's house.


77
00:04:19.287 --> 00:04:21.948
- What swamp?
- It's gone now.


78
00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:22.999
Figures.

79
00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.469
See the impossible for once.

80
00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.205
By definition, that's impossible.

81
00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:32.050
I beg to differ.

82
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.730
For example, I bet you can't see that
water sprite loitering in the garden right now.


83
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.109
- A water sprite?
- That's right, a water sprite.


84
00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:42.652
Where?

85
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.606
There's no such thing.

86
00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:49.251
By the stone lantern.

87
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:51.286
I don't see anything.

88
00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.635
You're just loopy.
I don't believe in the impossible.


89
00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:04.682
It's that kind of stuff that drove
dad away, remember?


90
00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:06.965
I suppose so.

91
00:05:07.293 --> 00:05:10.028
Oh, I'm sorry.

92
00:05:10.647 --> 00:05:12.290
No, you're right.

93
00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:21.908
I'll come again next month, alright?

94
00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:23.293
Okay.

95
00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:25.219
Here, Gonzaburo.

96
00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:27.956
Let's go home, Gonzaburo.

97
00:05:28.923 --> 00:05:33.219
<i>My mom may be a bit scatty,
but I know what she means.</i>


98
00:05:33.386 --> 00:05:36.790
<i>Besides my biggest problem right now...</i>

99
00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:40.260
<i>is a feeling of gradual erosion.</i>

100
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.914
Hello, Ogata?

101
00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:56.893
Did the agent agree to a photo shoot?

102
00:05:57.593 --> 00:05:58.444
What?

103
00:05:58.544 --> 00:06:01.381
No!? Why not?

104
00:06:05.034 --> 00:06:06.719
That stinks.

105
00:06:07.813 --> 00:06:11.491
Yeah, okay. Thanks, anyway.

106
00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.597
<i>I feel my life slowly but surely
eroding away.</i>


107
00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:25.728
<i>"Ill-fated"</i>

108
00:06:26.227 --> 00:06:27.257
Creepy.

109
00:06:27.557 --> 00:06:30.477
<i>I think I know the cause.</i>

110
00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:37.584
<i>My father left us on my 8th birthday.</i>

111
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:43.523
<i>At that time seeing my mother
not put up a fight irked me to no end.</i>


112
00:06:44.057 --> 00:06:48.669
<i>So I threw everything my dad ever
gave me into a local swamp.</i>


113
00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:56.853
<i>I found out later that
he'd married a rich woman...</i>


114
00:06:57.003 --> 00:06:59.839
<i>so he could lead the easy life.</i>

115
00:06:59.973 --> 00:07:03.776
<i>This simply wasn't acceptable to me.</i>

116
00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:25.064
<i>The memory of the last item,
a cat talisman sinking, remains with me.</i>


117
00:07:25.798 --> 00:07:27.367
You blame the cat?

118
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.805
Yeah. It cursed me as it sank.

119
00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.809
That's not like you.

120
00:07:35.984 --> 00:07:37.010
How so?

121
00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:40.747
Because you don't believe
in that kind of stuff.

122
00:07:42.682 --> 00:07:44.817
True. I don't.

123
00:07:46.244 --> 00:07:48.488
What happened to the swamp?

124
00:07:48.955 --> 00:07:51.808
It's a vacant landfill now.

125
00:07:52.108 --> 00:07:56.696
Oh, yeah?
Then why don't you dig it out?


126
00:07:56.963 --> 00:07:58.998
I'll never find it.

127
00:07:59.098 --> 00:08:01.568
But it bothers you, right?

128
00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:07.840
I'd do it.
I'd rescue the cat if I could.


129
00:08:08.473 --> 00:08:10.643
Well, I'm not you.

130
00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:14.222
Very true.

131
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:19.535
Chief?

132
00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:26.009
The boss wants to see you.

133
00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:30.913
Uh oh.

134
00:08:32.307 --> 00:08:35.243
Are sales that bad?

135
00:08:35.343 --> 00:08:38.746
Worse. They're non-existent!

136
00:08:39.572 --> 00:08:40.822
Oh.

137
00:08:43.468 --> 00:08:45.645
How about a big special issue next month?

138
00:08:45.745 --> 00:08:48.014
That won't be enough.

139
00:08:48.114 --> 00:08:49.691
Why's that?

140
00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:53.711
The magazine's doomed.
Out the window.


141
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:56.481
No way! I'll figure out something!

142
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:00.902
You'll "figure out something"?
That's what they all say.


143
00:09:01.002 --> 00:09:05.857
Okay, we'll run a feature that
has greater mass appeal.


144
00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:08.293
- Those flowers smell like poop.
- Really?


145
00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:10.495
Like a public toilet.

146
00:09:10.595 --> 00:09:12.664
No, I hadn't noticed.

147
00:09:13.131 --> 00:09:15.383
Hey, you're right.

148
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.171
Hey, where's that writer, Ichinose?

149
00:09:20.271 --> 00:09:22.941
She called.
Said she's running a bit late.


150
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.577
- Why?
- She worked all night.


151
00:09:25.677 --> 00:09:27.420
Eh!? Really?

152
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.613
Is it that surprising?

153
00:09:30.865 --> 00:09:32.817
No, it isn't, actually.

154
00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:39.173
What are you working on?

155
00:09:39.273 --> 00:09:40.825
The "ramen" shop feature.

156
00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:42.960
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

157
00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:48.374
- Not again?
- What's that?


158
00:09:48.474 --> 00:09:49.592
My horoscope.

159
00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:52.845
What man your age believes that crap?

160
00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:54.948
But it's accurate!

161
00:09:55.148 --> 00:09:56.908
No, it's not.

162
00:09:57.158 --> 00:10:00.812
That's right. Haname's a big skeptic.

163
00:10:01.062 --> 00:10:04.098
The stars don't know your life!

164
00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:07.652
You sure about that?

165
00:10:07.752 --> 00:10:09.404
Assuredly.

166
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.997
What do you believe in, then?

167
00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:26.162
I see...

168
00:10:26.262 --> 00:10:28.418
<i>Tachibana-kun's question
got my mind wandering...</i>


169
00:10:28.518 --> 00:10:32.469
<i>to thoughts of a
tiny little ambition of mine.</i>

170
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.839
<i>The truth is I
have a crush on someone.</i>

171
00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:40.460
<i>Foota Amaya, our former photographer...</i>

172
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.305
<i>now a huge success in Milan.</i>

173
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.806
Hey! Hey!

174
00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:49.777
Get off our front porch!

175
00:10:50.436 --> 00:10:53.147
We're doing a fashion shoot.

176
00:10:53.247 --> 00:10:55.725
So? What do I care?

177
00:10:55.825 --> 00:10:57.818
Look out!

178
00:10:59.078 --> 00:11:01.114
You could kill someone!

179
00:11:01.214 --> 00:11:03.741
<i>I owe it to static electricity.</i>

180
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:08.146
<i>In winter, I create static electricity
with anyone I come into contact with.</i>


181
00:11:08.246 --> 00:11:10.565
You forgot this, Chief.

182
00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:11.749
Oh, thanks.

183
00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:15.325
- Ow!
- So we have a deal then, Haname?


184
00:11:15.714 --> 00:11:16.721
Ouch!

185
00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:20.816
<i>It's the worst with people who
aren't my type.</i>


186
00:11:21.634 --> 00:11:23.703
I'm editor Jinchoge.

187
00:11:23.803 --> 00:11:26.030
Hello, Amaya... photographer.

188
00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:32.881
Oh!

189
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:35.072
Something wrong?

190
00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:38.568
<i>- No electric shock whatsoever.
- No, not at all.</i>


191
00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:42.814
<i>That's rare enough to make
one believe in fate.</i>


192
00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:47.518
- You okay?
- Yeah.


193
00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:58.555
- Stop that!
- Looks good on you.


194
00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.981
Pose.

195
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.235
<i>"Let's take a souvenir picture of today!!"
- What, in here?</i>


196
00:12:04.335 --> 00:12:09.473
<i>For a brief moment,
it felt like we were a pair, but...</i>


197
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.845
<i>then he left for Italy.</i>

198
00:12:16.113 --> 00:12:18.883
<i>If my current magazine succeeds...</i>

199
00:12:18.983 --> 00:12:23.855
<i>I plan to start a European-based
fashion magazine of my own.</i>


200
00:12:25.214 --> 00:12:29.727
<i>And if all goes well, I could
live with Amaya in Milan.</i>


201
00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:35.800
<i>But that dream is being crushed under
a heap of unsold magazines.</i>


202
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.810
Hello? Ichinose, you're late

203
00:12:47.578 --> 00:12:52.016
Is that right? Then wait in the lobby.
I'll be right down.


204
00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.447
Okay.

205
00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:58.222
Where are my business cards?

206
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:07.615
Ti-hya-mo-chai.

207
00:13:07.715 --> 00:13:09.300
Ow!

208
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.221
What the...?

209
00:13:15.823 --> 00:13:18.225
Hey! Ms. Ichinose!

210
00:13:22.513 --> 00:13:23.648
'Scuse me.

211
00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.520
That ramen had no flavor.

212
00:13:29.737 --> 00:13:31.989
- Whole garlic?
- Yep.


213
00:13:33.488 --> 00:13:36.123
- T'aint nothing.
- Hear hear.


214
00:13:36.223 --> 00:13:38.304
You recommended it.

215
00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:39.914
Yes, I did.

216
00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:42.500
Well, t'aint nothing.

217
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.936
No, it's "Nuthin'."

218
00:13:45.036 --> 00:13:48.047
You've gotta say it like, "nuthin'".

219
00:13:48.247 --> 00:13:49.857
"T'aint nuthin'."

220
00:13:49.957 --> 00:13:51.667
- Pardon?
- Huh?


221
00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:52.835
Did you just say something?

222
00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:54.137
"T'aint nuthin'!"

223
00:13:54.237 --> 00:13:57.615
Oh, sorry...
Ugh, talk about bad breath!


224
00:13:57.748 --> 00:13:59.467
Well, excuse me!

225
00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:01.310
Ah, look here.

226
00:14:02.036 --> 00:14:03.263
Route 20 Mints.

227
00:14:03.363 --> 00:14:05.589
Please try some.

228
00:14:05.882 --> 00:14:08.893
T'aint nuthin'.

229
00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:13.972
Hey, look.

230
00:14:17.952 --> 00:14:20.504
T'aint nuthin'.

231
00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:26.544
Yes, hello?

232
00:14:26.644 --> 00:14:28.321
T'ain't nuthin'.

233
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:32.233
What? Return to the office now?

234
00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:37.121
<i>"Route 20 Mints"
"Do your sighs smell bad?"</i>


235
00:14:38.072 --> 00:14:41.158
T'aint nuthin'.

236
00:14:43.627 --> 00:14:45.997
Ugh! Makes my eyes sting.

237
00:14:47.598 --> 00:14:50.073
<i>The train is now arriving at platform three...</i>

238
00:14:50.173 --> 00:14:56.465
Like I was saying Boss, we're just at the stage
where readers are getting a feel for the magazine.


239
00:14:57.992 --> 00:14:59.343
Problem?

240
00:14:59.535 --> 00:15:03.965
Well, to be frank your breath
doesn't do much for morale.


241
00:15:04.065 --> 00:15:08.002
Well, excuse me,
but I was on my way home.


242
00:15:08.102 --> 00:15:09.946
Still, it stinks.

243
00:15:10.146 --> 00:15:14.275
Anyway, your argument lacks
a sense of crisis.


244
00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:17.561
Well, when you're trying
something new...


245
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:21.749
At any rate the next issue needs
something topical or else...


246
00:15:21.849 --> 00:15:24.218
How about a story on spirit ghosts?

247
00:15:24.318 --> 00:15:27.221
Spirit ghosts? 
The supernatural, huh?

248
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:29.907
- I'm sensitive to ghostly phenomena.
- Really?


249
00:15:30.007 --> 00:15:34.553
Hey, give me a break.
A feature on "ghosts"?


250
00:15:34.653 --> 00:15:37.398
It's cosmopolitan women's magazine!

251
00:15:37.498 --> 00:15:40.935
- Summer's the time for it.
- No, it isn't.


252
00:15:41.035 --> 00:15:42.370
How about you, Ichinose?

253
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.055
I think...

254
00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:51.395
Whoah! No offense but...
that's one stinky sneeze.


255
00:15:52.446 --> 00:15:54.240
Well, sorry!

256
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.067
I mean, really.

257
00:15:57.843 --> 00:16:02.706
<i>In the end, we found ourselves leaving
to report on some "ghost spot".</i>


258
00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:06.719
Good morning.

259
00:16:06.819 --> 00:16:08.262
Morning.

260
00:16:17.797 --> 00:16:21.400
Is it far to this so-called
"cursed swamp"?


261
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.895
3 hour-drive into the mountains.

262
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.567
- What kind of curse is it?
- Hell if I know.


263
00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:33.287
- Good morning.
- Hey.


264
00:16:33.387 --> 00:16:37.255
- Morning.
- Hey, did this hotel give you the creeps?


265
00:16:37.408 --> 00:16:40.311
Yeah! It did!

266
00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:46.100
I heard strange noises all night.
There's definitely something up with this hotel.


267
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.501
Hardly.

268
00:16:49.178 --> 00:16:51.839
- Good morning.
- Morning.


269
00:16:51.939 --> 00:16:58.045
I was just talking to Ms. Kurara...
did anyone find this hotel a bit creepy?


270
00:16:58.145 --> 00:17:01.841
Since I was little, I've often seen
things like this.


271
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:04.935
Did you see anything. Ms. Tachibana?

272
00:17:05.135 --> 00:17:09.231
Well, nothing like that but...
I experienced sleep paralysis.


273
00:17:09.607 --> 00:17:11.292
You did!?

274
00:17:11.392 --> 00:17:13.436
Haname, there's definitely something here.

275
00:17:13.536 --> 00:17:16.914
There isn't.
It's a perfectly normal hotel.


276
00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:20.317
It's haunted, for sure.

277
00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:22.686
- My lights flickered.
- For real?


278
00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:26.957
How can you all possibly
believe in ghosts?


279
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:31.495
Then what did we come here for?

280
00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:32.847
Good point.

281
00:17:32.947 --> 00:17:38.894
Good point, my ass.
Don't be a troublemaker.


282
00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:44.170
Okay.

283
00:17:46.585 --> 00:17:48.312
That's great.

284
00:17:49.914 --> 00:17:51.749
- Hold it.
- Right.


285
00:17:52.983 --> 00:17:54.185
Never mind.

286
00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:58.390
- How about cold Chinese noodles for lunch?
- Let's go with a slightly sad look.


287
00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.691
Good idea, as it's so hot.

288
00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:02.241
Hey, take a look at this.

289
00:18:07.464 --> 00:18:08.799
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:10.209 --> 00:18:11.076
What is it?

291
00:18:11.176 --> 00:18:12.595
It's real strong.

292
00:18:12.695 --> 00:18:14.148
What?

293
00:18:14.248 --> 00:18:16.622
- The curse?
- I can't do this.


294
00:18:16.724 --> 00:18:19.994
- I feel exactly the same! It's got to be the curse.
- It must be.


295
00:18:20.094 --> 00:18:22.863
Let's call it quits. What if something
awful should happen?


296
00:18:22.963 --> 00:18:24.507
- I agree.
- Me, too.


297
00:18:24.607 --> 00:18:29.186
What!? If there is something,
we need to report on it.


298
00:18:29.336 --> 00:18:32.223
Stop being such sissies!

299
00:18:32.303 --> 00:18:33.424
Hey, wait!

300
00:18:33.524 --> 00:18:34.558
Stop it!

301
00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:35.810
What for?

302
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.428
Don't bait it.

303
00:18:37.978 --> 00:18:39.210
Don't harumph!

304
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.016
Why? Will a dragon or a sprite appear?

305
00:18:42.116 --> 00:18:43.742
Something bigger.

306
00:18:43.842 --> 00:18:46.556
What? How stupid!

307
00:18:46.656 --> 00:18:49.407
Produce something then.
Prove me wrong!


308
00:18:49.506 --> 00:18:50.941
Can't do that.

309
00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:53.177
Then I'll believe you!

310
00:18:58.624 --> 00:19:01.552
You've angered it!

311
00:19:01.702 --> 00:19:04.404
Now you've done it!

312
00:19:05.831 --> 00:19:10.060
And so we will be suspending
the magazine indefinitely.


313
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:16.558
A "banzai" would be out of place,
so let's close by saying, "too bad".


314
00:19:19.044 --> 00:19:21.905
Well then, shall we? One, two...

315
00:19:22.005 --> 00:19:24.525
Too bad.

316
00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:29.563
You having fun, Boss?
You all think this is funny?


317
00:19:29.663 --> 00:19:31.515
Psst... Haname.

318
00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:35.519
I don't find it funny at all!

319
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.548
Take it easy, Jinchoge!

320
00:19:39.648 --> 00:19:41.073
Calm down, Haname-san.

No... thank you.

Nope!

Yes, of course.

Sorry, Ma'am.

I see.

Afraid not.

490
00:30:58.485 --> 00:31:04.140
It was lying very close to where
your mother was found.


491
00:31:05.075 --> 00:31:08.320
Anything come to mind?

492
00:31:14.826 --> 00:31:16.136
No.

493
00:31:17.028 --> 00:31:18.763
I don't know.

494
00:31:18.863 --> 00:31:22.759
What do you think this rod
and cucumber means?


495
00:31:23.009 --> 00:31:25.195
Some kind of invention?

496
00:31:25.295 --> 00:31:27.824
I wouldn't call it an "invention".
Would you?


497
00:31:27.924 --> 00:31:29.299
Hardly.

498
00:31:29.399 --> 00:31:31.017
'Course not.

499
00:31:31.251 --> 00:31:33.551
Cucumber to catch water sprites?

500
00:31:33.651 --> 00:31:36.748
Don't trivialize things.

501
00:31:36.848 --> 00:31:38.358
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

502
00:31:38.458 --> 00:31:39.759
That's okay.

503
00:31:39.859 --> 00:31:43.829
Another oddity was found
in the lake, too.


504
00:31:44.731 --> 00:31:46.374
A post post.

505
00:31:46.524 --> 00:31:48.093
"Post post"?

506
00:31:48.293 --> 00:31:49.519
Post box.

507
00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:51.688
- Oh, that's right.
- Huh?


508
00:31:51.788 --> 00:31:54.516
Stolen 30 years ago.

509
00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:55.792
A post box.

510
00:31:55.959 --> 00:31:57.685
Yes, a post box.

511
00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:21.861
Well, I may have said
a little too much, but still...


512
00:32:22.494 --> 00:32:23.953
So Nakajima, found anything?

513
00:32:24.004 --> 00:32:28.875
Well, most of the letters are illegible.
But some are okay.


514
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:32.362
Hey!

515
00:32:32.837 --> 00:32:34.164
What is it?

516
00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:41.096
Huh? How do you
read these characters?


517
00:32:41.221 --> 00:32:42.822
"Jinchoge."

518
00:32:44.461 --> 00:32:45.484
No way.

519
00:32:45.584 --> 00:32:47.735
I'm serious.

520
00:32:51.506 --> 00:32:54.767
Man, I want to quit forensics!

521
00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.124
Anyway, this letter emerged.

522
00:33:01.224 --> 00:33:04.361
It was sent by your mother.

523
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:09.282
We could deliver it to the
address listed on it.


524
00:33:10.267 --> 00:33:12.702
But we thought you should see it.

525
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:16.055
Ti-hya-mo-chai.

526
00:33:16.155 --> 00:33:17.440
Excuse me?

527
00:33:17.907 --> 00:33:22.635
I mean, we're dealing with
something big here.


528
00:33:22.735 --> 00:33:23.741
What?

529
00:33:24.197 --> 00:33:25.790
Just try and relax.

530
00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.200
That would be you.

531
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.752
Exactly.

532
00:33:28.877 --> 00:33:30.370
What does it say?

533
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.155
I can't...

534
00:33:34.282 --> 00:33:36.501
Give us an idea.

535
00:33:36.601 --> 00:33:37.469
Please.

536
00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:39.596
It could be important.

537
00:33:39.696 --> 00:33:40.947
Could be.

538
00:33:41.573 --> 00:33:43.533
But if I tell you...

539
00:33:44.451 --> 00:33:49.322
you'll learn that
I'm not my father's child.


540
00:33:49.681 --> 00:33:51.007
Sorry?

541
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.660
<i>According to the letter...</i>

542
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.063
<i>skipping over some stuff...</i>

543
00:33:57.163 --> 00:33:59.265
<i>the most surprising bit reads...</i>

544
00:33:59.365 --> 00:34:04.704
<i>"The child I am carrying is yours."</i>

545
00:34:04.804 --> 00:34:10.844
<i>"But I plan to keep that locked away
in my heart as I marry 'him'."</i>


546
00:34:10.944 --> 00:34:15.056
So the letter's addressed to
your real dad?


547
00:34:15.657 --> 00:34:18.618
It would appear so.

548
00:34:20.453 --> 00:34:24.240
But I have my doubts.

549
00:34:30.221 --> 00:34:31.464
Something wrong?

550
00:34:31.865 --> 00:34:33.758
Why the pirouette?

551
00:34:33.967 --> 00:34:36.311
Why not?

552
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:44.394
<i>Forget "gradual erosion." My life was
plunging into a bottomless swamp.</i>


553
00:34:44.777 --> 00:34:49.574
<i>According to my Aunt Ikeda, the man in
the letter was Noburo Jinchoge...</i>


554
00:34:49.674 --> 00:34:55.371
<i>a distant relative of my mother's
and something of a stain on the family.</i>


555
00:34:55.521 --> 00:35:01.911
<i>He disappeared a year before I was born,
and hasn't been heard from since.</i>


556
00:35:02.228 --> 00:35:07.450
<i>Still I couldn't help wonder what
kind of person my "real dad" was.</i>


557
00:35:07.901 --> 00:35:10.895
<i>Maybe my comatose mother...</i>

558
00:35:10.995 --> 00:35:17.135
<i>would regain consciousness after a
touching reunion with this man.</i>


559
00:35:17.235 --> 00:35:18.920
<i>"Noburo Jinchoge"</i>

560
00:35:21.439 --> 00:35:22.240
This way.

561
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:27.587
<i>Or maybe, I thought greedily,
he'd turn out to be some big tycoon.</i>


562
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:29.706
Yes!

563
00:35:31.824 --> 00:35:36.168
<i>Anyhow, I decided to seek out the
address on the letter.</i>


564
00:35:55.465 --> 00:36:01.020
<i>I didn't expect to find him, though.
After all, the address was 30 years old.</i>


565
00:36:01.254 --> 00:36:06.376
<i>The address led me to
a suspicious-looking antique shop.</i>


566
00:36:06.476 --> 00:36:09.652
"Antiques welcomed."

567
00:36:12.865 --> 00:36:14.167
Who're you!?

568
00:36:16.452 --> 00:36:17.670
What do you want?

569
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:23.660
Well, I'm looking for a
Mr. Noburo Jinchoge.


570
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.261
That's me.

571
00:36:26.596 --> 00:36:29.056
I'm Noburo Jinchoge.

572
00:36:36.556 --> 00:36:39.676
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

573
00:36:39.776 --> 00:36:43.095
Wait! Come in.

574
00:36:49.686 --> 00:36:51.796
So, what is it?

575
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.676
Oh, just a few interesting
circumstances.


576
00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.404
Antique shop?

577
00:36:59.504 --> 00:37:04.350
What's it look like?
Well, they're not real antiques.


578
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:05.476
Not real?

579
00:37:05.576 --> 00:37:07.103
'Course they're real!

580
00:37:07.437 --> 00:37:08.538
Take this for example.

581
00:37:08.638 --> 00:37:11.783
- What's that?
- Dried scorpion, for herbal medicine.


582
00:37:11.883 --> 00:37:14.869
Really? People buy this?

583
00:37:19.549 --> 00:37:20.650
See?

584
00:37:21.784 --> 00:37:23.186
That's an antique?

585
00:37:23.286 --> 00:37:25.196
No. A personal effect.

586
00:37:25.521 --> 00:37:27.056
Who are you?

587
00:37:27.156 --> 00:37:30.376
Actually, I'm a Jinchoge, too.

588
00:37:30.476 --> 00:37:31.603
A relative?

589
00:37:31.703 --> 00:37:34.864
Yeah, distant... very distant.

590
00:37:34.964 --> 00:37:36.232
That's good.

591
00:37:36.933 --> 00:37:37.859
Gum?

592
00:37:37.959 --> 00:37:39.652
Thank you.

593
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.622
Ow!

594
00:37:43.022 --> 00:37:44.082
Funny, huh?

595
00:37:44.182 --> 00:37:45.875
No, it's not!

596
00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:52.090
Are you considered "missing",
Mr. Noburo?


597
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.833
Who said that?

598
00:37:53.933 --> 00:37:55.718
All your relatives.

599
00:37:56.285 --> 00:37:59.455
Yes, I used to be a roamer.

600
00:38:00.523 --> 00:38:02.592
Up until 5 years ago.

601
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.136
Oh my God.

602
00:38:13.236 --> 00:38:14.812
Oh my...

603
00:38:16.222 --> 00:38:18.491
Phew.

604
00:38:19.267 --> 00:38:22.103
This is no run-of-the-mill cat talisman.

605
00:38:22.203 --> 00:38:27.917
It's a wealth-generating miracle
worker. I'll sell it to you for 2,000 yen.


606
00:38:28.017 --> 00:38:29.218
- Only, 2,000 yen.
- I'll take it!


607
00:38:29.761 --> 00:38:35.458
<i>I  survived by selling junk.
And I learned what people wanted.</i>


608
00:38:36.192 --> 00:38:37.479
Hence the shop?

609
00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:39.646
No, I was fibbing just now.

610
00:38:39.771 --> 00:38:40.813
Huh?

611
00:38:41.973 --> 00:38:44.217
I was in prison.

612
00:38:44.317 --> 00:38:46.177
- Really?
- No.


613
00:38:46.711 --> 00:38:50.106
- Look, Bub...
- But I have been all over Japan.


614
00:38:50.206 --> 00:38:54.477
Let me ask you again.
Are you Noburo Jinchoge?


615
00:38:54.577 --> 00:38:55.645
Me? No.

616
00:38:55.745 --> 00:38:56.779
I thought not.

617
00:38:56.879 --> 00:38:59.132
Just kidding. I'm him.

618
00:38:59.232 --> 00:39:00.917
What's the deal with you?

619
00:39:04.871 --> 00:39:06.322
And what's that?

620
00:39:06.422 --> 00:39:09.625
It's a secret coating.

621
00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:12.995
It turns anything old.

622
00:39:13.145 --> 00:39:14.688
For faking stuff?

623
00:39:14.838 --> 00:39:15.732
For aging stuff.

624
00:39:15.832 --> 00:39:17.300
Still...

625
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.035
- Hand me your cell phone.
- Okay.


626
00:39:23.956 --> 00:39:25.775
What're you doing!?

627
00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:27.552
You'll like this.

628
00:39:27.652 --> 00:39:29.537
No, I won't!

629
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:37.853
Hey, Ma... what's the deal with
this letter, huh?


630
00:39:38.463 --> 00:39:42.275
Is my real father Noburo Jinchoge?

631
00:39:42.658 --> 00:39:46.679
That shady peddler's my dad?

632
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.501
Hey, don't play dead with me.

633
00:39:56.823 --> 00:39:59.249
You're conscious, aren't you?

634
00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:05.748
Stop fooling around and start taking
some responsibility for your actions.


635
00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:16.892
If you're going to harbor a secret
like that, why can't it be...


636
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.870
<i>Oh darling~</i>

637
00:40:24.242 --> 00:40:28.037
even remotely romantic?

638
00:40:28.754 --> 00:40:31.541
No resemblance whatsoever.

639
00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:44.086
Life sucks.

640
00:40:45.087 --> 00:40:49.559
And it's getting worse by the second.

641
00:40:50.977 --> 00:40:54.947
No need to ever see him again.

642
00:40:56.249 --> 00:41:00.036
This letter is... rabbit food.

643
00:41:01.721 --> 00:41:03.556
No rabbit.

644
00:41:06.117 --> 00:41:08.678
Huh? My cell phone...

645
00:41:15.726 --> 00:41:19.972
It's Haname Jinchoge.
I visited you earlier today.


646
00:41:20.306 --> 00:41:23.643
I believe I left my cell phone there.

647
00:41:24.443 --> 00:41:29.765
Yes, the one you doused in mud.

648
00:41:30.708 --> 00:41:32.985
That's the one.

649
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:39.342
No, I can't make it out there.
Could you send it to me at...?


650
00:41:41.002 --> 00:41:44.810
Hey, I'm still talking.
Don't just hang up!


651
00:41:44.935 --> 00:41:47.500
XXX! XXX! Meow!

652
00:41:53.748 --> 00:41:56.557
- Well?
- What have you done!


653
00:41:56.734 --> 00:42:01.153
- It's hideous!
- That's odd, where is it...


654
00:42:02.356 --> 00:42:04.467
Watch it, onion breath!

655
00:42:04.567 --> 00:42:07.203
Sorry, sorry.

656
00:42:07.436 --> 00:42:13.759
Hey, Mr. Light Bulb! Look here!
What'll you give me for this painting?


657
00:42:13.859 --> 00:42:17.062
What's that?
I'll give you 10 yen.


658
00:42:19.073 --> 00:42:21.125
10 yen, huh?

659
00:42:21.225 --> 00:42:23.769
10 yen... ten... 10 yen!

660
00:42:23.869 --> 00:42:28.357
Really? But I thought it was pretty good.
Don't you think it's good?


661
00:42:28.457 --> 00:42:30.126
2 yen, then!

662
00:42:30.276 --> 00:42:31.227
Move it!

663
00:42:31.694 --> 00:42:35.131
Really? It's a good painting, though.

664
00:42:41.153 --> 00:42:43.472
He got smaller.

665
00:42:46.367 --> 00:42:47.943
Terrible painting, wasn't it.

666
00:42:48.043 --> 00:42:49.245
You could tell?

667
00:42:49.345 --> 00:42:50.813
Of course.

668
00:42:50.913 --> 00:42:53.263
Want to get something to eat?

669
00:42:53.663 --> 00:42:57.219
- Outta of the way, crab breath!
- Okay...


670
00:42:58.738 --> 00:43:00.323
Eat up.

671
00:43:00.423 --> 00:43:02.558
Looks delicious!

672
00:43:02.658 --> 00:43:04.560
Sure is. Right, Mama?

673
00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.389
You bet. One bite and...
you'll do flips.


674
00:43:11.735 --> 00:43:14.303
What's her story?

675
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.372
Ah, that's good!

676
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.946
Wow, this is fabulous!
I'm surprised.


677
00:43:24.046 --> 00:43:26.916
- You see?
- Yeah, tasty.


678
00:43:31.454 --> 00:43:32.913
That good, huh?

679
00:43:33.689 --> 00:43:35.858
I haven't eaten well of late.

680
00:43:35.958 --> 00:43:39.611
- Things are tough?
- Yeah, kind of.


681
00:43:41.822 --> 00:43:44.716
What's your mom's name?

682
00:43:45.835 --> 00:43:48.687
You kinda resemble someone.

683
00:43:49.038 --> 00:43:50.239
I do?

684
00:43:50.706 --> 00:43:55.002
A woman I knew...
the way you savor your food.


685
00:43:57.713 --> 00:43:58.906
Um...

686
00:43:59.682 --> 00:44:00.950
Welcome.

687
00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:02.518
Hey, Light Bulb.

688
00:44:02.618 --> 00:44:06.188
Yo, Gas.
Punk rockers eat omelets?


689
00:44:06.288 --> 00:44:07.289
Why not?

690
00:44:07.389 --> 00:44:10.126
Punk's should eat
something bad for them.


691
00:44:10.226 --> 00:44:11.603
Who asked you?

692
00:44:11.703 --> 00:44:14.663
Gas here is a hapless punk rocker.

693
00:44:14.763 --> 00:44:15.965
Shut up.

694
00:44:16.065 --> 00:44:18.326
- This is Haname.
- I'm Haname.


695
00:44:18.526 --> 00:44:19.612
Gas.

696
00:44:22.029 --> 00:44:23.005
Ow!

697
00:44:23.105 --> 00:44:25.641
Anyway's, you Light Bulb's girl?

698
00:44:25.741 --> 00:44:28.302
- No.
- She's a relative.


699
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:30.354
How boring.

700
00:44:30.454 --> 00:44:32.031
No, it's not.

701
00:44:36.569 --> 00:44:38.220
I see a resemblance.

702
00:44:39.021 --> 00:44:41.505
- To whom?
- To Light Bulb.


703
00:44:44.468 --> 00:44:46.186
Absolutely not!

704
00:44:46.495 --> 00:44:47.946
There is.

705
00:44:49.899 --> 00:44:51.767
No need to glare.

706
00:44:51.867 --> 00:44:54.461
An illegitimate child of yours?

707
00:44:59.909 --> 00:45:01.644
It's nothing like that!

708
00:45:05.181 --> 00:45:07.741
<i>It's very iffy.</i>

709
00:45:08.058 --> 00:45:13.714
<i>Could this "Light Bulb man"
really be my father?</i>


710
00:45:18.711 --> 00:45:23.966
<i>So the question is...
do I show him the letter or not?</i>


711
00:45:25.668 --> 00:45:27.019
Thief!

712
00:45:29.104 --> 00:45:30.981
Hello?

713
00:45:32.007 --> 00:45:34.610
What is that?

714
00:45:36.245 --> 00:45:37.847
Here's the switch.

715
00:45:38.414 --> 00:45:40.583
Is it safe?
Beware of electric shock.


716
00:45:42.284 --> 00:45:43.586
Hey!

717
00:45:44.186 --> 00:45:45.387
Not funny.

718
00:45:46.806 --> 00:45:48.290
<i>"Fish Sausage"
- What's that?</i>


719
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.725
Beats me.

720
00:45:53.562 --> 00:45:54.588
<i>"Yam Noodles"</i>

721
00:45:54.688 --> 00:45:55.906
What's this?

722
00:45:56.315 --> 00:45:58.759
Let's try it again.

723
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.571
<i>"Fish Dumpling"</i>

724
00:46:05.774 --> 00:46:06.801
Hey.

725
00:46:08.544 --> 00:46:09.612
You again?

726
00:46:09.912 --> 00:46:11.063
What's that?

727
00:46:11.314 --> 00:46:12.114
Ah!

728
00:46:12.214 --> 00:46:13.616
I know!

729
00:46:13.716 --> 00:46:17.161
- It's an "oden" roulette device.
- Why?


730
00:46:17.261 --> 00:46:21.223
Dunno. But these are all
"oden" ingredients.


731
00:46:21.323 --> 00:46:23.626
- Can I ask something?
- Sure.


732
00:46:23.726 --> 00:46:26.453
Why make a roulette device for "oden"?

733
00:46:26.695 --> 00:46:28.981
How should I know?

734
00:46:29.206 --> 00:46:31.867
Is there a need for this?

735
00:46:31.967 --> 00:46:37.598
I doubt it. Maybe it's for
commercial use.


736
00:46:38.407 --> 00:46:41.343
Ah, you may have a point there!

737
00:46:41.443 --> 00:46:43.312
Commercial use, right?

738
00:46:46.448 --> 00:46:47.666
<i>"Red poppy"</i>

739
00:46:47.975 --> 00:46:51.620
"Red poppy"?
Can't eat that.


740
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.856
That's odd.

741
00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.203
<i>"Indian Summer"</i>

742
00:47:00.279 --> 00:47:04.650
Weird. It's straying even
further from food.


743
00:47:06.326 --> 00:47:07.917
This...

744
00:47:08.017 --> 00:47:09.989
It's just nonsense.

745
00:47:10.089 --> 00:47:11.390
Gotcha.

746
00:47:12.983 --> 00:47:15.753
What do you think it's for, then?

747
00:47:15.853 --> 00:47:17.036
Who cares?

748
00:47:17.136 --> 00:47:18.542
You don't want to know?

749
00:47:18.642 --> 00:47:20.458
Not in the slightest.

750
00:47:20.666 --> 00:47:22.109
What's that?

751
00:47:22.234 --> 00:47:23.569
Wheat Sludge. Hungry?

752
00:47:23.669 --> 00:47:25.755
No, thanks. That's gross.

753
00:47:25.855 --> 00:47:26.856
Right?

754
00:47:29.892 --> 00:47:31.460
Excuse me...

755
00:47:35.064 --> 00:47:35.931
Yes?

756
00:47:36.031 --> 00:47:37.867
Mr. Light Bulb?

757
00:47:37.967 --> 00:47:39.810
That's me.

758
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.105
I'm so glad. I've been looking for you.

759
00:47:43.205 --> 00:47:45.449
You have? Me?

760
00:47:46.158 --> 00:47:48.913
Welcome, Madam.
You... get out!


761
00:47:49.013 --> 00:47:50.247
- Hey!
- What the hell!?


762
00:47:50.348 --> 00:47:51.763
Can you help me?

763
00:47:51.863 --> 00:47:53.699
Certainly. Your wish is my command.

764
00:47:53.799 --> 00:47:56.093
Huh? See that change?

765
00:47:56.193 --> 00:47:57.619
Must be his "type".

766
00:47:57.719 --> 00:48:01.382
The truth is I'd
like to look for something.

767
00:48:01.482 --> 00:48:05.794
You've come to the right place.
What is it your searching for?


768
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.742
Do you have a King Tut
fortune-telling machine?


769
00:48:15.095 --> 00:48:16.438
No, that's not it.

770
00:48:18.849 --> 00:48:19.825
Come again?

771
00:48:19.925 --> 00:48:23.620
It came out over 20 years ago.

772
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.193
"Insert 100 yen"?

773
00:48:30.293 --> 00:48:35.724
<i>It showed the face of
one's future spouse.</i>


774
00:48:37.192 --> 00:48:39.995
<i>It was shaped like King Tut.</i>

775
00:48:40.112 --> 00:48:46.735
<i>In the name of the pharaoh, please enter
your date of birth and gender.</i>


776
00:48:47.059 --> 00:48:54.034
<i>Very well. Your future partner
in life will be this gentleman.</i>


777
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.254
<i>It produced a photograph.</i>

778
00:48:57.354 --> 00:48:58.697
Let me see.

779
00:48:59.148 --> 00:49:02.668
Oh my God. He looks dorky.

780
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.721
You try then, Wakako.

781
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:14.613
<i>Very well. Your future partner
in life will be this gentleman.</i>


782
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:20.010
Hey, let me see.

783
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.095
No!

784
00:49:23.756 --> 00:49:25.298
Let me see!

785
00:49:25.891 --> 00:49:27.259
Wait!

786
00:49:27.384 --> 00:49:28.719
You ate it?

787
00:49:29.853 --> 00:49:31.980
Yes... well...

788
00:49:32.164 --> 00:49:34.858
He was that bad, huh?

789
00:49:35.259 --> 00:49:38.871
I don't remember his face.
I ate the photo so quickly.


790
00:49:38.971 --> 00:49:41.031
I'm confused here.

791
00:49:41.131 --> 00:49:44.601
You feared facing your destiny.
All people do.


792
00:49:44.701 --> 00:49:45.903
But why eat it?

793
00:49:46.003 --> 00:49:48.439
She was "swallowing" her fate.

794
00:49:48.539 --> 00:49:50.474
Yeah, whatever.

795
00:49:50.866 --> 00:49:52.509
Please don't laugh.

796
00:49:53.015 --> 00:49:54.060
Hey!

797
00:49:56.255 --> 00:49:58.223
It's the pharaoh's curse.

798
00:49:58.857 --> 00:50:02.911
You see... I'm still single.

799
00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.563
With your beauty?

800
00:50:04.663 --> 00:50:06.915
What pharaoh's curse?

801
00:50:07.282 --> 00:50:10.794
Of course,
I've been proposed to by a man.


802
00:50:10.894 --> 00:50:14.606
But I just couldn't be sure if...

803
00:50:15.074 --> 00:50:17.042
he was the one...

804
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:20.746
in the photograph.

805
00:50:20.846 --> 00:50:22.797
Little obsessive?

806
00:50:23.182 --> 00:50:27.694
Hasn't anything ever
bothered you like that?


807
00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:30.276
Ah!

808
00:50:32.257 --> 00:50:37.779
If it bothered you that much,
why didn't you try it again?


809
00:50:37.965 --> 00:50:39.322
I did.

810
00:50:40.941 --> 00:50:44.586
<i>I returned to the same place
the next day.</i>


811
00:50:45.012 --> 00:50:48.252
<i>But the King Tut fortune-telling
machine was gone.</i>


812
00:50:56.398 --> 00:50:58.992
Excuse me! Where's the King Tut
fortune-telling machine?


813
00:50:59.092 --> 00:51:02.045
<i>I asked a nearby bar owner
about it.</i>


814
00:51:02.287 --> 00:51:05.040
<i>He denied it ever existed.</i>

815
00:51:06.058 --> 00:51:09.094
Sounds like something from
The Twighlight Zone.


816
00:51:09.194 --> 00:51:11.864
- That's for sure.
- So you want me to find it?


817
00:51:12.865 --> 00:51:14.383
It's not here, is it?

818
00:51:14.483 --> 00:51:17.035
- Regrettably, no.
- I see.


819
00:51:17.135 --> 00:51:19.471
Never heard of such a thing.

820
00:51:19.571 --> 00:51:21.340
Perhaps you imagined it?

821
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.101
No. I saw it.

822
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:25.511
I haven't.

823
00:51:25.611 --> 00:51:29.631
You only believe what you can see,
so stay out of this.


824
00:51:29.731 --> 00:51:30.641
Why?

825
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:35.212
We humans can see the unbelievable,
if we allow ourselves to believe it.


826
00:51:35.312 --> 00:51:36.563
I don't allow it.

827
00:51:36.663 --> 00:51:37.832
Quiet, greenhorn!

828
00:51:37.932 --> 00:51:38.982
Huh!?

829
00:51:39.449 --> 00:51:43.637
I beg you to find it.
I can pay you fairly well.


830
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:47.532
Are you pretty well off?

831
00:51:47.858 --> 00:51:49.668
Yes, somewhat.

832
00:51:49.768 --> 00:51:52.846
Don't worry. Consider it found.

833
00:51:53.105 --> 00:51:56.064
- Right?
- Don't look at me.


834
00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.135
- Thanks so much for your tme.
- Well, see you again.


835
00:52:02.706 --> 00:52:04.632
Wait a second!

836
00:52:08.378 --> 00:52:11.108
Here, this'll bring you luck.

837
00:52:11.208 --> 00:52:12.809
Thank you.

838
00:52:13.884 --> 00:52:15.936
Oh, wait! Please!

839
00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:25.320
What a sucker he is
taking a job like that.


840
00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:27.072
But you'll look for it, right?

841
00:52:27.172 --> 00:52:28.540
She's paying us.

842
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.269
I've never heard of a King Tut
fortune-telling machine.


843
00:52:32.369 --> 00:52:37.132
Even so, if it was 20 years ago,
it's probably been destroyed.


844
00:52:37.232 --> 00:52:39.000
You don't know that.

845
00:52:40.577 --> 00:52:42.996
Huh? Whose side are you on?

846
00:52:43.096 --> 00:52:44.216
What do you mean?

847
00:52:44.416 --> 00:52:46.583
Be consistent here.

848
00:52:47.159 --> 00:52:50.053
Do you believe that? Or not?

849
00:52:50.153 --> 00:52:54.049
I waver sometimes too, you know.

850
00:52:59.513 --> 00:53:01.949
A King Tut machine, right?

851
00:53:02.049 --> 00:53:03.317
Find anything?

852
00:53:03.417 --> 00:53:05.051
I sure did.

853
00:53:09.606 --> 00:53:12.242
Sorry to bother you with this.

854
00:53:12.342 --> 00:53:13.802
No problem at all.

855
00:53:14.945 --> 00:53:19.541
So how's married life so far?
Troublesome?


856
00:53:20.058 --> 00:53:21.410
Lovely.

857
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.228
- How nice.
- Yes.


858
00:53:23.328 --> 00:53:24.563
I don't care.

859
00:53:24.663 --> 00:53:25.510
You don't?

860
00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:27.057
I don't.

861
00:53:27.316 --> 00:53:32.220
Now that fortune telling machine you're
wondering about...


862
00:53:34.406 --> 00:53:35.978
- Here it is.
- This?


863
00:53:36.078 --> 00:53:37.291
<i>"Pharaoh Tells All"
- Yes, that's it.</i>


864
00:53:37.391 --> 00:53:39.828
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.


865
00:53:40.312 --> 00:53:41.538
So this is it.

866
00:53:41.638 --> 00:53:45.709
A company called Taian Trading
got it from guess where?


867
00:53:45.809 --> 00:53:46.700
Where?

868
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.478
Overseas.

869
00:53:54.442 --> 00:53:55.393
Creepy.

870
00:53:57.116 --> 00:53:58.147
Ugh!

871
00:54:01.525 --> 00:54:03.535
Yes, I remember.

872
00:54:03.635 --> 00:54:05.153
Really?

873
00:54:05.504 --> 00:54:07.581
Why would I lie?

874
00:54:07.731 --> 00:54:09.207
Good point.

875
00:54:09.641 --> 00:54:11.893
Egyptian-looking.

876
00:54:12.602 --> 00:54:14.296
King Tut, was it?

877
00:54:14.513 --> 00:54:19.885
That was a real puzzling piece
of machinery.


878
00:54:19.985 --> 00:54:23.667
It produced photographs of people's
future spouses, right?


879
00:54:23.767 --> 00:54:25.248
Yeah, that's right.

880
00:54:30.687 --> 00:54:33.232
Hey, how did it work?

881
00:54:33.332 --> 00:54:36.801
Don't ask me. I have no idea.

882
00:54:37.427 --> 00:54:40.105
But it was accurate.

883
00:54:40.339 --> 00:54:41.540
You're kidding.

884
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:44.868
It was right about...

885
00:54:45.844 --> 00:54:47.521
my wife.

886
00:54:49.514 --> 00:54:53.301
Um... is the machine still around?

887
00:54:53.618 --> 00:54:54.986
God, no.

888
00:54:55.186 --> 00:54:56.530
Hey, Boss!

889
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:58.490
Dead crow here!

890
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.251
What? Get rid of it then.

891
00:55:01.351 --> 00:55:03.186
No way!

892
00:55:04.112 --> 00:55:07.958
Unbelievable...
It takes all kinds, right?


893
00:55:08.475 --> 00:55:12.328
Might you have a bill of
goods or something?


894
00:55:13.468 --> 00:55:14.464
No.

895
00:55:15.941 --> 00:55:21.413
Look here, it was over 20 years ago.
And nobody bought them.


896
00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:23.790
What do you say to that?

897
00:55:24.524 --> 00:55:26.168
Nothing.

898
00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:30.305
If it's gone, it's gone.

899
00:55:30.814 --> 00:55:32.366
Let's make one.

900
00:55:32.466 --> 00:55:33.842
How?

901
00:55:34.059 --> 00:55:36.136
I'm an electrician.

902
00:55:36.236 --> 00:55:37.629
Not gas?

903
00:55:37.938 --> 00:55:39.856
So sue me.

904
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.708
She'll know for sure.

905
00:55:41.808 --> 00:55:43.018
Maybe not.

906
00:55:43.118 --> 00:55:45.403
Yes, she will.

907
00:55:47.839 --> 00:55:49.883
She wants to believe.

908
00:55:49.983 --> 00:55:51.843
I suppose so.

909
00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:54.680
Oh, I want to show you something.

910
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.031
Hold this.

911
00:55:59.835 --> 00:56:01.745
Well?

912
00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.480
A nail?

913
00:56:03.755 --> 00:56:06.675
Bent in a very telling way.

914
00:56:09.663 --> 00:56:11.438
You think so?

915
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.715
Too bad. You fail.

916
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:17.961
This is how I determine my friends...
if a person understands this.


917
00:56:18.061 --> 00:56:19.354
With a nail?

918
00:56:19.604 --> 00:56:23.825
People who can appreciate this...
earn my trust.


919
00:56:27.229 --> 00:56:29.347
Ready or not...!

920
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:31.483
Ready!

921
00:56:31.583 --> 00:56:37.405
<i>You see, I once found a perfectly
bent nail in a storehouse.</i>


922
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:39.524
<i>A hook nail.</i>

923
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:41.593
Look here!

924
00:56:41.693 --> 00:56:45.881
<i>I showed it off to everybody at school.</i>

925
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:48.617
Ta-da! Isn't it great?

926
00:56:48.767 --> 00:56:53.212
<i>- But nobody agreed with me.
- Crazy!</i>


927
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.010
<i>The first to appreciate it was,
surprisingly, my mom.</i>


928
00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:02.831
The secret to good sketches is size.

929
00:57:02.931 --> 00:57:06.935
<i>She called it "lovely."
And we both drew pictures of it.</i>


930
00:57:08.353 --> 00:57:10.881
<i>When I worked for a magazine...</i>

931
00:57:11.021 --> 00:57:14.910
<i>and we did a feature on antiques...</i>

932
00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:18.455
<i>I suggested the nail
for the cover page, but...</i>


933
00:57:18.555 --> 00:57:19.781
But?

934
00:57:20.357 --> 00:57:22.033
It was rejected.

935
00:57:22.133 --> 00:57:28.473
Except for a writer named Ichinose.
She said it was cute.


936
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:31.977
So I fail?

937
00:57:32.844 --> 00:57:36.164
Miserably! You didn't get it at all.

938
00:57:36.857 --> 00:57:38.091
Big deal.

939
00:57:38.191 --> 00:57:40.302
Fail, fail, fail!

940
00:57:40.402 --> 00:57:41.786
Shut up!

941
00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.593
Hey.

942
00:57:50.729 --> 00:57:53.849
Forget it. There's no King Tut.

943
00:57:53.949 --> 00:57:55.350
You never know.

944
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:58.562
Break the news to
Ms. Wakako yourself, okay?


945
00:57:58.662 --> 00:58:03.467
Ms. Wakako... what an incredible beauty.
I'd like to marry her.


946
00:58:03.567 --> 00:58:05.352
I bet... you cheat.

947
00:58:05.452 --> 00:58:06.695
"Cheat"?

948
00:58:06.795 --> 00:58:07.637
Well, because...

949
00:58:07.737 --> 00:58:10.400
Oh my! I didn't know you
liked me that much, Haname.


950
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.150
You should've said sooner.

951
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.019
That's not it!

952
00:58:14.553 --> 00:58:16.054
What're you doing?

953
00:58:16.154 --> 00:58:17.747
Puckering up.

954
00:58:17.847 --> 00:58:19.365
Gross.

955
00:58:22.327 --> 00:58:24.679
- Hey, Light Bulb...
- Yeah, what's up?


956
00:58:25.914 --> 00:58:27.140
Hello.

957
00:58:28.767 --> 00:58:31.311
There's a game graveyard.

958
00:58:31.686 --> 00:58:32.745
Bingo!

959
00:58:33.847 --> 00:58:38.510
<i>So we all spontaneously headed for
an arcade game graveyard.</i>


960
00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:41.830
So you were investigating
on your own, Gas?


961
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:43.548
Found it by chance.

962
00:58:44.024 --> 00:58:45.191
Thank you.

963
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:47.218
He's an okay guy, really.

964
00:58:47.318 --> 00:58:49.913
- For a punk rocker.
- Quiet.


965
00:58:51.923 --> 00:58:53.091
Let's all get along.

966
00:58:53.191 --> 00:58:54.893
That's right.

967
00:59:20.351 --> 00:59:21.686
Hold it.

968
00:59:29.862 --> 00:59:31.708
You two!

969
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:35.976
- Yes, I certainly remember seeing it.
- Really?


970
00:59:36.076 --> 00:59:37.886
He's got a good memory.

971
00:59:37.986 --> 00:59:39.964
Must've been 20 years ago.

972
00:59:40.064 --> 00:59:41.039
This?

973
00:59:41.406 --> 00:59:44.300
Wow, that's nostalgic!

974
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.220
- Think it's really here?
- Well, it's possible.


975
00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:51.616
That's right. That heap is
for stuff under 30 years old.


976
00:59:51.716 --> 00:59:53.776
Have a look.

977
00:59:54.452 --> 00:59:56.346
Looks impossible.

978
00:59:56.446 --> 01:00:00.592
Don't worry. Things have
a way of working out.


979
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.765
By the way, where's the third guy?

980
01:00:05.865 --> 01:00:07.023
He died.

981
01:00:07.123 --> 01:00:07.924
Eh?

982
01:00:08.024 --> 01:00:10.026
Just kidding, he has indigestion.

983
01:00:12.137 --> 01:00:13.938
What the...?

984
01:00:25.742 --> 01:00:27.402
Can I borrow this?

985
01:00:27.877 --> 01:00:29.087
Sure, go ahead.

986
01:00:45.995 --> 01:00:49.215
<i>Gas excavated the game graveyard...</i>

987
01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:53.761
<i>as if he were an archaeologist
among the pyramids of Egypt.</i>


988
01:00:54.846 --> 01:00:59.484
<i>Pretty soon, he'd found something odd.</i>

989
01:01:00.376 --> 01:01:01.469
What?

990
01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:03.129
I found a cave.

991
01:01:03.229 --> 01:01:04.931
That's suspicious.

992
01:01:11.529 --> 01:01:14.165
- Let's go in.
- You're kidding!


993
01:01:14.265 --> 01:01:16.292
Okay! We'll split up.

994
01:01:19.037 --> 01:01:20.630
I'd rather not.

995
01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.732
That's okay. We'll handle it.

996
01:01:22.832 --> 01:01:25.107
What...?

997
01:01:27.178 --> 01:01:29.330
Then I bid you "pharaoh".

998
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.349
Oh, that's shocking.

999
01:01:33.885 --> 01:01:36.686
You brought the rain with that.

1000
01:01:36.786 --> 01:01:38.231
What could be worse?

1001
01:01:38.331 --> 01:01:39.632
Hey!

1002
01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:44.729
How's this?

1003
01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:47.498
Resourceful!

1004
01:01:52.412 --> 01:01:54.105
Here. You'll catch a cold.

1005
01:01:54.205 --> 01:01:55.556
Thank you.

1006
01:02:02.764 --> 01:02:04.182
Surprisingly effective.

1007
01:02:04.282 --> 01:02:06.251
I feel enchanted.

1008
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:08.594
Like the Seven Dwarves.

1009
01:02:20.306 --> 01:02:22.082
- Haname!
- Coming!


1010
01:02:22.994 --> 01:02:24.194
What is it?

1011
01:02:24.427 --> 01:02:26.154
Grab that end.

1012
01:02:26.421 --> 01:02:27.388
Here?

1013
01:02:28.238 --> 01:02:30.074
- One, two...
- Okay!


1014
01:02:32.325 --> 01:02:34.221
Wow!

1015
01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:36.547
Whoah!

1016
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.156
Ah, you found it.

1017
01:02:51.256 --> 01:02:52.655
You bet.

1018
01:02:53.264 --> 01:02:56.226
Your appointment with
destiny has come.


1019
01:02:56.326 --> 01:02:57.444
Ow... my tummy.

1020
01:02:57.544 --> 01:02:58.945
What's up with you?

1021
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.160
How's it look, Gas?

1022
01:03:15.954 --> 01:03:19.482
Well, the wiring looks intact.

1023
01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:24.637
Gas the electrician.
Sorry, I couldn't resist.


1024
01:03:24.787 --> 01:03:26.281
Don't sweat it.

1025
01:03:27.282 --> 01:03:30.760
Okay, let's give it a whirl.

1026
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.138
Got an outlet?

1027
01:03:33.238 --> 01:03:34.522
Here.

1028
01:03:40.103 --> 01:03:41.362
Ready?

1029
01:03:42.914 --> 01:03:44.317
Just a moment!

1030
01:03:44.968 --> 01:03:46.843
My tummy's acting up again.

1031
01:03:47.577 --> 01:03:49.329
You should eat better.

1032
01:03:49.429 --> 01:03:51.339
Go find a toilet.

1033
01:03:52.307 --> 01:03:53.958
I'm okay now.

1034
01:03:54.609 --> 01:03:55.843
Here goes.

1035
01:04:01.814 --> 01:04:03.192
That's funny.

1036
01:04:06.729 --> 01:04:08.389
It's not plugged in yet.

1037
01:04:08.489 --> 01:04:09.958
Well, come on.

1038
01:04:21.535 --> 01:04:23.263
Yipee!

1039
01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:26.624
We did it! We did it!

1040
01:04:26.724 --> 01:04:27.759
Pipe down.

1041
01:04:27.859 --> 01:04:29.110
Oh...

1042
01:04:29.961 --> 01:04:33.464
All right, Ms. Wakako. It's time.

1043
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:35.266
Yes.

1044
01:04:38.703 --> 01:04:42.323
My life's bill has come due.

1045
01:04:46.569 --> 01:04:52.332
<i>In the name of the pharaoh, please enter
your date of birth and gender.</i>


1046
01:04:58.623 --> 01:05:05.321
<i>Very well. Your future partner
in life will be this gentleman.</i>


1047
01:05:10.101 --> 01:05:11.652
Ms. Wakako.

1048
01:05:12.704 --> 01:05:13.838
Yes.

1049
01:05:20.664 --> 01:05:21.795
Huh!?

1050
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:23.848
So, what's he like?

1051
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.880
Eh!?

1052
01:05:39.297 --> 01:05:42.267
<i>Ms. Wakako's case aside...</i>

1053
01:05:42.367 --> 01:05:46.787
<i>I soon found myself obsessed
with antiques.</i>


1054
01:05:47.964 --> 01:05:51.909
<i>While I'm sure many items
carry historical value...</i>


1055
01:05:52.185 --> 01:05:56.264
<i>I'm more intrigued by those imbued
with sentimental value.</i>


1056
01:05:56.672 --> 01:06:01.327
<i>What's one man's garbage
is another man's treasure.</i>


1057
01:06:07.492 --> 01:06:12.405
<i>The thrill is detecting value in
something that seems worthless.</i>


1058
01:06:12.505 --> 01:06:14.532
<i>Then watching it's value rise.</i>

1059
01:06:14.632 --> 01:06:17.904
- Wait, I was first.
- Hey...


1060
01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:19.466
Give that back!

1061
01:06:20.304 --> 01:06:22.824
<i>It's all very strange and exciting.</i>

1062
01:06:22.924 --> 01:06:24.374
- Stop it!
- Get off!


1063
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:28.290
Let go! Give it back.

1064
01:06:30.973 --> 01:06:32.116
Stop!

1065
01:06:33.818 --> 01:06:39.156
<i>So I decided to show Mr. Light Bulb
my most prized possession.</i>


1066
01:06:41.075 --> 01:06:42.126
What's this?

1067
01:06:42.226 --> 01:06:43.828
A bent nail.

1068
01:06:43.953 --> 01:06:45.580
A "bent nail"?

1069
01:06:53.454 --> 01:06:55.097
It's a great nail!

1070
01:06:55.932 --> 01:06:57.283
Right?

1071
01:06:57.383 --> 01:06:58.776
Remarkable!

1072
01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:02.031
The degree of rust,
the arc of it's bend.


1073
01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:03.904
It's the best I've seen!

1074
01:07:04.004 --> 01:07:05.483
You understand!?

1075
01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:07.034
No, wait.

1076
01:07:08.134 --> 01:07:10.346
It's an ideal specimen.

1077
01:07:10.496 --> 01:07:12.924
I'm so glad you agree.

1078
01:07:13.024 --> 01:07:14.325
I'll give you 1,000 yen for it.

1079
01:07:14.425 --> 01:07:17.820
No! It's my prized possession.
It's not for sale!


1080
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.380
- 10,000 yen!
- Ah, sold.


1081
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.890
Just kidding.

1082
01:07:21.015 --> 01:07:22.525
What's that?

1083
01:07:23.983 --> 01:07:26.480
You should open a shop.

1084
01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:27.605
Pardon?

1085
01:07:28.039 --> 01:07:29.865
You may have "the gift".

1086
01:07:32.335 --> 01:07:33.628
Follow me.

1087
01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:38.066
<i>We went to a mountain temple.</i>

1088
01:07:38.216 --> 01:07:41.477
<i>To appraise an heirloom of some kind.</i>

1089
01:07:41.577 --> 01:07:43.120
What is it?

1090
01:07:43.471 --> 01:07:44.975
A water sprite.

1091
01:07:45.075 --> 01:07:45.947
What?

1092
01:07:46.047 --> 01:07:49.018
Mummified water sprite, to be exact.

1093
01:07:49.118 --> 01:07:50.620
Oh, come on!

1094
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.482
Without a doubt.
Please examine it.


1095
01:07:54.582 --> 01:07:55.933
Certainly.

1096
01:07:58.052 --> 01:07:59.487
Excuse me.

1097
01:08:01.022 --> 01:08:05.175
Yes? Oh, hello!
Yes, yes, of course...


1098
01:08:06.068 --> 01:08:07.228
I see.

1099
01:08:08.796 --> 01:08:11.265
My profession?

1100
01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:15.462
Excuse me.

1101
01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:17.582
Hello?

1102
01:08:17.882 --> 01:08:19.683
I'm a "soryo," a monk.

1103
01:08:20.516 --> 01:08:23.327
That's right, I said "Soryo".

1104
01:08:23.761 --> 01:08:27.265
<i>Soryo (Soryu) Aska Langley.
(Neon Genesis Evangelion character)</i>


1105
01:08:27.365 --> 01:08:29.700
- Oh, excuse the pun.
- Water sprite?


1106
01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.503
I see them sometimes.

1107
01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:36.841
Most are fakes, made with turtle shells.

1108
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:39.310
A real one fetches 30 million yen.

1109
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:41.445
Don't be stupid.

1110
01:08:41.863 --> 01:08:46.517
<i>If it is real, then maybe
the one mother saw was...</i>


1111
01:08:49.362 --> 01:08:51.923
It was nothing but a prank.

1112
01:08:52.023 --> 01:08:54.050
Scared you, though.

1113
01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:55.635
Well, of course!

1114
01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.397
It's strange how people really
do "recoil" in fear.


1115
01:08:59.487 --> 01:09:02.600
Yes, it is.
Can I put you down, now?


1116
01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:03.543
No!

1117
01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:05.002
Why not?

1118
01:09:05.369 --> 01:09:06.627
Hey...

1119
01:09:06.727 --> 01:09:07.713
What?

1120
01:09:07.813 --> 01:09:10.967
Did you ever marry?

1121
01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:12.309
Nope.

1122
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:15.561
Why do you ask?

1123
01:09:15.661 --> 01:09:16.956
It's a secret.

1124
01:09:17.123 --> 01:09:18.524
Why you...!

1125
01:09:20.777 --> 01:09:22.411
Safe.

1126
01:09:22.511 --> 01:09:23.660
Shut up.

1127
01:09:28.693 --> 01:09:34.331
You know what, Mr. Light Bulb
is an interesting guy.


1128
01:09:34.657 --> 01:09:38.519
I can see what
you saw in him, Ma.

1129
01:09:40.313 --> 01:09:44.558
Hey, should I show him the letter
and bring him here?


1130
01:09:44.742 --> 01:09:47.211
Maybe then you'll wake up.

1131
01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:52.466
Stop playing Sleeping Beauty!

1132
01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:55.253
Please lower your voice.

1133
01:09:55.353 --> 01:09:57.329
Oh... sorry.

1134
01:10:01.717 --> 01:10:03.978
So rude!

1135
01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:12.678
There's something I want to do, Ma.

1136
01:10:13.154 --> 01:10:15.831
Hmm?

1137
01:10:16.741 --> 01:10:18.117
You serious?

1138
01:10:19.377 --> 01:10:20.961
Dead serious.

1139
01:10:21.345 --> 01:10:23.622
A pawn shop?

1140
01:10:23.722 --> 01:10:25.675
Antiques.

1141
01:10:25.775 --> 01:10:28.711
I worry about your gradual erosion.

1142
01:10:28.811 --> 01:10:30.700
Well, don't!

1143
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.376
What, has marriage made you stodgy?

1144
01:10:34.508 --> 01:10:37.436
So, how's married life?

1145
01:10:37.536 --> 01:10:39.363
We got divorced.

1146
01:10:39.513 --> 01:10:41.499
Oh my.

1147
01:10:41.699 --> 01:10:43.050
That was quick.

1148
01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:45.745
One month exactly.

1149
01:10:45.845 --> 01:10:47.955
How'd that happen?

1150
01:10:51.292 --> 01:10:52.668
Can I not say?

1151
01:10:52.768 --> 01:10:54.904
Oh gosh, I'm sorry.

1152
01:10:55.004 --> 01:10:55.908
That's okay.

1153
01:10:56.008 --> 01:10:59.409
Nothing a good night's sleep won't cure.

1154
01:11:01.635 --> 01:11:06.649
Here we are. An opinion leader
in antique shops.


1155
01:11:06.749 --> 01:11:10.585
A lot of shops take their cues
from this place.


1156
01:11:10.685 --> 01:11:11.495
<i>"Artless"</i>

1157
01:11:11.595 --> 01:11:14.398
Looks real chic.

1158
01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:19.353
It's charming.

1159
01:11:19.537 --> 01:11:20.510
Cute, huh?

1160
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.831
Yeah.

1161
01:11:25.957 --> 01:11:27.678
- That's adorable.
- So cute!


1162
01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:30.205
20,000 yen!

1163
01:11:30.906 --> 01:11:32.867
Bit expensive, don't you think?

1164
01:11:32.967 --> 01:11:34.518
What'd you expect?

1165
01:11:34.618 --> 01:11:39.340
- Yeah, but for this?
-  You gotta admit it's cute.


1166
01:11:40.983 --> 01:11:42.718
Quiet, please.

1167
01:11:42.868 --> 01:11:45.245
Oh, sorry.

1168
01:12:00.403 --> 01:12:01.704
What's up with him?

1169
01:12:01.804 --> 01:12:03.914
Knock it off.

1170
01:12:20.115 --> 01:12:21.861
Oh, sorry.

1171
01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:30.808
Ow...

1172
01:12:31.675 --> 01:12:34.812
- Stop it.
- It's my stomach.


1173
01:12:35.963 --> 01:12:38.148
Well, excuse me!

1174
01:12:48.475 --> 01:12:49.802
It was stylish, though.

1175
01:12:49.902 --> 01:12:52.246
That's what's annoying.

1176
01:12:52.346 --> 01:12:53.581
True.

1177
01:12:53.656 --> 01:12:57.167
Which is why I shouldn't launch
a fashion magazine.


1178
01:12:59.353 --> 01:13:00.830
What's wrong?

1179
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:02.573
I gave pause.

1180
01:13:03.365 --> 01:13:07.511
Why did I work for that publisher
in the first place?


1181
01:13:08.262 --> 01:13:12.433
I hope it fails, and everyone goes home!

1182
01:13:14.668 --> 01:13:19.640
Ho-hum. I think I've failed in life.

1183
01:13:20.274 --> 01:13:21.725
What's wrong?

1184
01:13:22.059 --> 01:13:25.512
Things just haven't been going well.

1185
01:13:26.722 --> 01:13:29.333
Maybe I'll join a cult.

1186
01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.137
No, that's not me.

1187
01:13:33.754 --> 01:13:37.858
Hey, Ichinose!
Heard anything interesting lately?


1188
01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:40.002
- I have.
- What?


1189
01:13:40.102 --> 01:13:42.079
Remember Ms. Tachibana?

1190
01:13:42.179 --> 01:13:43.873
Yeah, how is she?

1191
01:13:43.973 --> 01:13:46.500
- She's in Italy right now.
- Really?


1192
01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.489
She was chosen for that new
European magazine project.


1193
01:13:53.399 --> 01:13:55.334
She was, huh?

1194
01:13:55.943 --> 01:13:57.244
Shocked?

1195
01:13:58.035 --> 01:13:59.279
Not at all.

1196
01:14:00.923 --> 01:14:07.221
What's more, she's living with Amaya
the photographer, in Milan.


1197
01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:12.710
Huh?

1198
01:14:20.901 --> 01:14:24.004
<i>Right now, I've got
a million yen in savings.</i>


1199
01:14:25.205 --> 01:14:26.540
Right!

1200
01:14:28.359 --> 01:14:34.206
Well, no use just dragging my feet.
Time to go all out!


1201
01:14:34.932 --> 01:14:38.318
Look out! Here I come!

1202
01:14:38.627 --> 01:14:43.348
A branch office shouldn't be punished
for headquarter's poor accounting.


1203
01:14:43.557 --> 01:14:45.918
It's just not fair.

1204
01:14:46.396 --> 01:14:47.469
Whoa!

1205
01:14:54.518 --> 01:14:56.679
Ah, I'm overdoing it.

1206
01:14:56.779 --> 01:15:00.074
Uh, no, it's nothing.

1207
01:15:01.926 --> 01:15:05.596
You still there? No, I'm not crying.
Why would I cry?


1208
01:15:08.716 --> 01:15:15.039
<i>So I threw half my savings into opening
a small antique shop of my own.</i>


1209
01:15:16.423 --> 01:15:20.911
<i>No more gradual erosion for me.
But I still had one problem.</i>


1210
01:15:21.011 --> 01:15:22.817
Welcome.

1211
01:15:35.651 --> 01:15:36.844
Shall we go?

1212
01:15:41.115 --> 01:15:43.157
<i>No sales whatsoever.</i>

1213
01:15:54.545 --> 01:15:56.681
<i>"Let's take a souvenir picture of today!!"</i>

1214
01:15:56.881 --> 01:15:58.609
Ho-hum...

1215
01:15:58.709 --> 01:16:01.035
<i>The back sliding returns.</i>

1216
01:16:09.409 --> 01:16:10.694
Hey, what's up?

1217
01:16:11.253 --> 01:16:14.373
Absolutely nothing.

1218
01:16:14.473 --> 01:16:15.591
Nothing at all?

1219
01:16:15.691 --> 01:16:20.162
Yep. No tension, no excitement, nothing.

1220
01:16:20.262 --> 01:16:22.414
- Want some advice?
- Sure.


1221
01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.150
Open up your water faucet.

1222
01:16:25.359 --> 01:16:26.426
What do you mean?

1223
01:16:27.394 --> 01:16:28.512
Come here.

1224
01:16:33.113 --> 01:16:34.109
Huh?

1225
01:16:34.443 --> 01:16:35.602
Right! Let's buy a soda.

1226
01:16:35.702 --> 01:16:37.271
Eh? But it'll overflow!

1227
01:16:37.371 --> 01:16:38.872
That's the thrill!

1228
01:16:38.998 --> 01:16:39.973
Hang on...

1229
01:16:40.073 --> 01:16:40.958
Wait!

1230
01:16:41.058 --> 01:16:42.442
Hurry!

1231
01:16:49.393 --> 01:16:51.568
There it is! Go! Go!

1232
01:16:51.668 --> 01:16:54.096
Hurry up! There's no time to lose!

1233
01:16:54.997 --> 01:16:56.799
- What'll you have?
- Erm, that!


1234
01:16:56.899 --> 01:16:57.733
And you?

1235
01:16:57.833 --> 01:16:59.335
Not soda!

1236
01:16:59.435 --> 01:17:00.777
Ah!! Tea!

1237
01:17:01.929 --> 01:17:04.840
Got it! Right, let's go!

1238
01:17:09.878 --> 01:17:11.038
Hurry!

1239
01:17:11.138 --> 01:17:12.281
Oh, crap!

1240
01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:13.215
Safe!

1241
01:17:13.315 --> 01:17:16.668
I almost peed my pants!
Oh, my nerves!


1242
01:17:16.768 --> 01:17:19.580
- See?
- Such a thrill just from buying a soda!


1243
01:17:19.755 --> 01:17:21.490
Okay, next!

1244
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:24.301
Now I get you.

1245
01:17:27.054 --> 01:17:28.314
Full blast?

1246
01:17:28.439 --> 01:17:29.882
Full blast!

1247
01:17:29.982 --> 01:17:31.150
Good!

1248
01:17:31.967 --> 01:17:33.293
Let's eat lunch!

1249
01:17:33.393 --> 01:17:35.295
Right you are!

1250
01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:44.913
- Excuse me!
-  Yes, what'll it be?


1251
01:17:45.013 --> 01:17:46.173
- Chukadon!
- Sure.


1252
01:17:46.273 --> 01:17:48.492
- Chili shrimp.
- Okay...


1253
01:17:50.269 --> 01:17:52.130
Don't order that!

1254
01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:53.045
Why not?

1255
01:17:53.145 --> 01:17:57.251
Takes too long! Listen, with mine,
the vegetables are already prepared.


1256
01:17:57.351 --> 01:17:59.153
And you just throw it on rice.

1257
01:17:59.253 --> 01:18:02.447
But with shrimp,
they have to deep-fry... aaah!


1258
01:18:07.035 --> 01:18:08.228
Thank you!

1259
01:18:08.328 --> 01:18:09.580
Bad choice!

1260
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.790
- But I wanted it.
- Hurry!


1261
01:18:14.441 --> 01:18:17.062
Argh!! Out of the way!

1262
01:18:18.147 --> 01:18:19.573
Too late?

1263
01:18:23.644 --> 01:18:25.245
Safe!

1264
01:18:25.345 --> 01:18:28.749
Oh, my nerves are shot!

1265
01:18:28.849 --> 01:18:30.742
- What're you doing?
- Ah, I'm worn out!


1266
01:18:30.842 --> 01:18:34.571
Wow, amazing tension!

1267
01:18:34.755 --> 01:18:37.558
- The faucet thing's incredible!
- Isn't it!


1268
01:18:37.658 --> 01:18:40.794
You lost me.
Anyways, how's your shop?


1269
01:18:40.894 --> 01:18:42.638
It's the absolute pits!

1270
01:18:42.738 --> 01:18:44.623
'Cause it lacks character!

1271
01:18:44.723 --> 01:18:48.852
It doesn't! It's stylish
unlike this musty old fleabag!


1272
01:18:48.952 --> 01:18:53.757
You need targeted merchandise!
Not just anything will do!


1273
01:18:53.857 --> 01:18:55.484
I sell white elephants!

1274
01:18:55.584 --> 01:18:56.526
Copycat.

1275
01:18:56.626 --> 01:18:58.620
That won't work!

1276
01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.455
What will then!?

1277
01:19:00.555 --> 01:19:01.856
Think!

1278
01:19:06.587 --> 01:19:08.105
I got it!

1279
01:19:08.205 --> 01:19:09.064
What!?

1280
01:19:09.164 --> 01:19:10.999
Black things!

1281
01:19:11.099 --> 01:19:13.135
But that's copycat, too!

1282
01:19:13.235 --> 01:19:16.013
I'll try it!

1283
01:19:21.351 --> 01:19:26.873
<i>So I blew the rest of my savings
on cute, black things.</i>


1284
01:19:32.554 --> 01:19:35.798
- This is really cute, isn't it?
- Yes.


1285
01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:38.009
I'll take it please.

1286
01:19:38.452 --> 01:19:41.413
Thank you. That'll be 2,000 yen.

1287
01:19:44.132 --> 01:19:45.650
Thank you.

1288
01:19:47.711 --> 01:19:49.129
Yes!

1289
01:19:49.305 --> 01:19:50.839
Excuse me, can I get through.

1290
01:19:50.939 --> 01:19:52.725
Haname!

1291
01:19:52.825 --> 01:19:54.543
- Ichinose!
- Excuse me, sorry.


1292
01:19:54.643 --> 01:19:56.854
Can I squeeze by? Thanks.

1293
01:19:56.954 --> 01:20:00.507
Wow! This place is booming!

1294
01:20:00.607 --> 01:20:04.718
- Thanks to your article.
- Ah, it was nothing.


1295
01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.182
It's alright, you can be yourself here.

1296
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.746
Wow, time for new procurement!

1297
01:20:29.895 --> 01:20:34.054
No, no, metrically speaking,
the economy's still on the decline.


1298
01:20:34.154 --> 01:20:37.030
Exactly, we need to make
downward revisions.


1299
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:40.070
- Whoah!
- Oh yeah!!


1300
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:42.417
You betcha!

1301
01:20:42.874 --> 01:20:45.235
No, it's nothing.

1302
01:20:46.119 --> 01:20:49.890
You know what, let's put those
revisions on hold for a bit.


1303
01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:59.950
Hi!

1304
01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.251
Hey!

1305
01:21:02.027 --> 01:21:02.903
What?

1306
01:21:03.003 --> 01:21:03.979
Eh?

1307
01:21:04.154 --> 01:21:06.640
You called me here, remember?

1308
01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:15.341
Strike!

1309
01:21:16.625 --> 01:21:18.135
How's business?

1310
01:21:19.336 --> 01:21:23.540
Thriving. I recouped my investment.

1311
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.643
That's great. How much was that?

1312
01:21:26.768 --> 01:21:29.037
About a million yen.

1313
01:21:29.137 --> 01:21:31.241
Wow.

1314
01:21:34.042 --> 01:21:39.231
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about something, Light Bulb.


1315
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:40.465
Me, too.

1316
01:21:40.565 --> 01:21:43.015
Rock, paper, scissors!

1317
01:21:43.288 --> 01:21:44.144
Me first.

1318
01:21:44.244 --> 01:21:46.113
Dang.

1319
01:21:46.763 --> 01:21:51.043
Look, I've decided to close the shop.

1320
01:21:51.143 --> 01:21:53.387
What!? Why?

1321
01:21:53.487 --> 01:21:55.814
It's time.

1322
01:21:56.356 --> 01:22:01.694
I'm a roamer. I've stayed
in one place too long.


1323
01:22:01.903 --> 01:22:03.463
I see.

1324
01:22:05.057 --> 01:22:08.885
I hate that flag-raising.

1325
01:22:09.469 --> 01:22:12.998
They can't time it with the music.

1326
01:22:13.098 --> 01:22:15.117
See? Too slow!

1327
01:22:15.217 --> 01:22:17.602
Can't they adjust it halfway up?

1328
01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:23.758
I don't want my life to be like that.
It's time.


1329
01:22:24.234 --> 01:22:27.354
I see. So, when?

1330
01:22:27.454 --> 01:22:28.622
Tomorrow.

1331
01:22:28.747 --> 01:22:30.773
- Come on?
- No, really.


1332
01:22:30.873 --> 01:22:33.660
You can't close shop that quickly.

1333
01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.291
Never underestimate the antique network.
They're predatory.


1334
01:22:40.133 --> 01:22:41.993
What will you do?

1335
01:22:42.477 --> 01:22:44.421
Hit the road.

1336
01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.991
You're a distant relative, right?

1337
01:22:48.191 --> 01:22:49.734
Yeah.

1338
01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:55.949
This is a key to the Jinchoge
family storehouse.


1339
01:22:56.049 --> 01:22:58.010
- Storehouse?
- Yes, that's right.


1340
01:22:58.210 --> 01:23:01.054
What's in it?

1341
01:23:01.254 --> 01:23:05.133
An untold fortune.
But I can't divulge.


1342
01:23:05.233 --> 01:23:07.362
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't know.


1343
01:23:07.813 --> 01:23:09.537
Well, what do you say?

1344
01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.209
I'll take it.

1345
01:23:17.836 --> 01:23:19.254
A million yen.

1346
01:23:19.754 --> 01:23:21.581
Eh!?

1347
01:23:22.225 --> 01:23:25.287
<i>The bank will be closing shortly.</i>

1348
01:23:25.387 --> 01:23:28.748
<i>Thank you for your business today.</i>

1349
01:23:39.809 --> 01:23:40.827
Hey.

1350
01:23:41.653 --> 01:23:43.254
Zip... whoosh.

1351
01:23:44.064 --> 01:23:45.123
Really?

1352
01:23:45.273 --> 01:23:47.776
Untold fortune, right?

1353
01:23:47.876 --> 01:23:53.140
Absolutely. I've done my share of swindling,
but this is a mountain of treasure.


1354
01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.967
I'll hunt you down and beat you
if you lie.


1355
01:23:56.067 --> 01:23:57.486
Okay.

1356
01:23:59.717 --> 01:24:00.714
Yo.

1357
01:24:00.864 --> 01:24:01.915
Hi.

1358
01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:04.501
What's this? Something up?

1359
01:24:04.601 --> 01:24:05.835
Nope, nothing.

1360
01:24:06.253 --> 01:24:08.763
I'm going to miss you.

1361
01:24:08.863 --> 01:24:10.373
You'd better.

1362
01:24:10.473 --> 01:24:13.635
Miss me? Not with Ms. 
Wakako around.

1363
01:24:13.735 --> 01:24:15.704
- No need to bring that up.
- Excuse me?


1364
01:24:16.897 --> 01:24:18.406
Huh? You didn't tell her?

1365
01:24:18.506 --> 01:24:19.924
No, he didn't.

1366
01:24:20.342 --> 01:24:21.843
I was about to.

1367
01:24:21.943 --> 01:24:23.203
So speak.

1368
01:24:23.303 --> 01:24:25.964
He's gonna live with her.

1369
01:24:26.164 --> 01:24:26.949
Really?

1370
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.899
Really.

1371
01:24:28.099 --> 01:24:30.702
That big act you staged paid off.

1372
01:24:30.802 --> 01:24:32.237
It wasn't a big act.

1373
01:24:32.337 --> 01:24:34.197
What big act?

1374
01:24:34.548 --> 01:24:39.052
The King Tut fortune telling machine.
It wasn't buried.


1375
01:24:39.152 --> 01:24:40.662
It wasn't?

1376
01:24:40.987 --> 01:24:42.197
It was staged.

1377
01:24:42.297 --> 01:24:43.515
Why?

1378
01:24:43.932 --> 01:24:47.502
'Cause Light Bulb fell for Ms. Wakako.

1379
01:24:47.602 --> 01:24:51.039
I happened upon the machine a while ago.

1380
01:24:51.139 --> 01:24:54.893
We planted the photo, got everything ready.
Made it seem like we had just found it.


1381
01:24:54.993 --> 01:24:56.152
And bingo!

1382
01:24:56.252 --> 01:24:58.004
Hold it right there!

1383
01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:05.328
Don't tell her.
I want to be her man of destiny.


1384
01:25:05.428 --> 01:25:10.734
Come on... so that emotional
discovery was all a fix?


1385
01:25:10.834 --> 01:25:14.972
Of course. You think a 20-year-old
machine would work?


1386
01:25:15.172 --> 01:25:19.117
You two are... scum.

1387
01:25:19.434 --> 01:25:20.585
Why?

1388
01:25:20.869 --> 01:25:24.489
Now I can't believe anything!

1389
01:25:24.589 --> 01:25:27.759
Then here. Take this back.

1390
01:25:27.859 --> 01:25:29.452
Keep it!

1391
01:25:29.878 --> 01:25:32.897
I'm just... so disappointed!

1392
01:25:35.742 --> 01:25:37.244
Watch it!

1393
01:25:37.344 --> 01:25:40.897
Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1394
01:26:07.123 --> 01:26:08.452
Excuse me...

1395
01:26:08.552 --> 01:26:09.685
Yes?

1396
01:26:10.285 --> 01:26:12.229
Is this nail for sale?

1397
01:26:12.329 --> 01:26:13.246
Erm...

1398
01:26:13.346 --> 01:26:17.053
- There's no price tag.
- Uh, no.


1399
01:26:17.153 --> 01:26:19.911
It's beautiful isn't it?

1400
01:26:21.062 --> 01:26:22.488
300 yen.

1401
01:26:23.473 --> 01:26:24.924
I'll take it.

1402
01:26:25.275 --> 01:26:26.893
Thank you.

1403
01:26:31.448 --> 01:26:34.517
This makes me so happy.

1404
01:26:35.143 --> 01:26:36.595
Me, too.

1405
01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:38.145
Thanks.

1406
01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:39.745
Here.

1407
01:26:41.608 --> 01:26:43.384
- Thank you.
- You too.


1408
01:26:44.794 --> 01:26:46.078
Wait...

1409
01:26:46.465 --> 01:26:47.388
Yes?

1410
01:26:47.488 --> 01:26:51.300
Uh, nothing. Thank you.

1411
01:26:59.993 --> 01:27:01.385
<i>No, wait.</i>

1412
01:27:02.370 --> 01:27:04.756
<i>It's an ideal specimen.</i>

1413
01:27:11.118 --> 01:27:12.302
Door key...

1414
01:27:12.647 --> 01:27:13.807
Got it.

1415
01:27:26.603 --> 01:27:31.024
<i>I wonder why I never called him Dad,</i>

1416
01:27:31.258 --> 01:27:34.068
<i>knowing I might never see him again.</i>

1417
01:27:34.302 --> 01:27:37.247
<i>I shouldn't have been so stubborn.</i>

1418
01:27:37.347 --> 01:27:41.952
<i>Not believing in ghosts, or things
I can't confirm with my own eyes.</i>


1419
01:27:42.052 --> 01:27:45.147
<i>It's ultimately stubbornness.</i>

1420
01:27:45.347 --> 01:27:50.635
<i>That's it, the weight of my stubbornness
is what's dragging me into the swamp.</i>


1421
01:28:03.223 --> 01:28:06.075
It was a surprisingly big store.

1422
01:28:07.185 --> 01:28:09.145
He's gone, huh?

1423
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:11.806
Did I mess things up?

1424
01:28:11.906 --> 01:28:13.165
What do you mean?

1425
01:28:13.475 --> 01:28:16.286
By opening my big mouth.

1426
01:28:16.836 --> 01:28:19.355
Oh, that. Maybe.

1427
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.594
He told me to
apologize to you for him.

1428
01:28:25.003 --> 01:28:27.188
That, too, is pathetic.

1429
01:28:27.288 --> 01:28:29.106
And say thanks for the dough.

1430
01:28:29.231 --> 01:28:32.369
Worse than pathetic. 
Selfish, right?

1431
01:28:32.469 --> 01:28:34.546
Yeah, sure is.

1432
01:28:35.597 --> 01:28:39.317
Ultra-super special ultimate selfish, right?

1433
01:28:39.417 --> 01:28:41.169
No doubt.

1434
01:28:43.279 --> 01:28:44.681
Read this.

1435
01:28:44.881 --> 01:28:49.819
It's a letter my mom wrote to
Mr. Light Bulb.


1436
01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:52.889
What?

1437
01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.836
Eh!?

1438
01:29:12.717 --> 01:29:15.328
This is pure anarchy!

1439
01:29:15.428 --> 01:29:17.088
It sure is.

1440
01:29:17.188 --> 01:29:18.682
Now what?

1441
01:29:18.782 --> 01:29:20.016
Nothing.

1442
01:29:20.116 --> 01:29:21.143
This.

1443
01:29:21.418 --> 01:29:22.568
Oh, that.

1444
01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:29.392
<i>Well, I might as well see if
the key is genuine or not.</i>


1445
01:29:29.584 --> 01:29:34.931
<i>If it is a key to a storehouse,
then it should contain a lot of stuff.</i>


1446
01:29:35.089 --> 01:29:41.913
<i>Maybe no gold, but perhaps one good
little find worth a million yen or so.</i>


1447
01:29:42.013 --> 01:29:43.256
Hurry up.

1448
01:29:43.356 --> 01:29:45.408
I'm hurrying.

1449
01:29:49.078 --> 01:29:50.430
Get a move on.

1450
01:29:51.114 --> 01:29:52.782
I'm hungry.

1451
01:29:52.882 --> 01:29:54.901
Live with it.

1452
01:29:55.927 --> 01:30:00.173
Ah! Over there!
Come on!


1453
01:30:03.384 --> 01:30:04.393
This it?

1454
01:30:05.103 --> 01:30:06.896
I'm sure of it.

1455
01:30:11.826 --> 01:30:14.737
Hey, it's sealed.

1456
01:30:15.071 --> 01:30:18.800
You think it might be cursed
or something?


1457
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.727
That was quick.

1458
01:30:23.521 --> 01:30:25.715
That leaves...

1459
01:30:26.858 --> 01:30:28.101
this.

1460
01:30:39.145 --> 01:30:40.313
It opened!

1461
01:30:41.956 --> 01:30:45.526
Light Bulb was telling the truth!

1462
01:31:05.202 --> 01:31:06.223
Ah...

1463
01:31:12.224 --> 01:31:13.070
Eh?

1464
01:31:17.635 --> 01:31:20.055
Hey...
Are you all right?


1465
01:31:23.406 --> 01:31:26.025
What's all this?

1466
01:31:26.634 --> 01:31:27.877
Dirt?

1467
01:31:28.103 --> 01:31:29.195
What!?

1468
01:31:29.295 --> 01:31:33.383
Just dirt? Thanks a lot!

1469
01:31:35.143 --> 01:31:36.786
He deceived you?

1470
01:31:37.846 --> 01:31:42.850
Yeah, he did. That jerk!

1471
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:45.350
I'll kill him!

1472
01:31:46.051 --> 01:31:47.001
Ah!

1473
01:31:47.852 --> 01:31:49.677
Argh!!!

1474
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:55.686
Ti-hya-mo-chai.

1475
01:32:01.869 --> 01:32:03.129
You okay?

1476
01:32:11.421 --> 01:32:15.708
Give it up. He duped you.

1477
01:32:16.175 --> 01:32:19.128
No. There's a reason for this dirt.

1478
01:32:19.228 --> 01:32:20.505
Like what?

1479
01:32:20.605 --> 01:32:24.626
Ah! Maybe there's gold dust mixed in here.

1480
01:32:24.726 --> 01:32:28.880
Maybe we just didn't notice.
But it's there.


1481
01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:31.149
Then be my guest.

1482
01:32:31.733 --> 01:32:37.663
Why fill this thing with dirt,
and then seal the place up?


1483
01:32:38.756 --> 01:32:40.984
Help me, please.

1484
01:32:41.084 --> 01:32:43.536
You were duped.

1485
01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:49.976
At least till the sun dips
behind those hills.


1486
01:32:50.835 --> 01:32:54.664
Just till the sun goes down!

1487
01:33:04.424 --> 01:33:06.000
Forget about it.

1488
01:33:16.611 --> 01:33:19.088
Are you asleep?

1489
01:33:22.383 --> 01:33:24.886
Hey, Mr. Gas?

1490
01:33:24.986 --> 01:33:26.429
What?

1491
01:33:27.855 --> 01:33:33.436
What if that dirt itself is
some kind of valuable resource.


1492
01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:35.054
Like plutonium...

1493
01:33:35.154 --> 01:33:36.172
Nope.

1494
01:33:37.357 --> 01:33:39.175
Yeah, you're right.

1495
01:33:42.562 --> 01:33:44.781
Sorry. Your trying to sleep?

1496
01:33:45.473 --> 01:33:46.958
Yeah.

1497
01:33:47.408 --> 01:33:53.006
You think the dirt contains
special powers?


1498
01:33:53.106 --> 01:33:55.984
Ah! Like for growing huge plants.

1499
01:33:56.084 --> 01:33:57.193
Nope.

1500
01:34:00.847 --> 01:34:02.507
- What if...?
- Nope!


1501
01:34:04.742 --> 01:34:07.279
- How about...?
- Just forget it.


1502
01:34:07.545 --> 01:34:09.655
I know but...

1503
01:34:10.039 --> 01:34:12.425
He deceived you, after all.

1504
01:34:13.142 --> 01:34:19.173
I don't think he was trying to "deceive"
me. It just turned out that way.


1505
01:34:19.273 --> 01:34:21.668
Excuse me.

1506
01:34:22.727 --> 01:34:25.138
Can I clear your plates?

1507
01:34:25.238 --> 01:34:26.706
Yes, thank you.

1508
01:34:26.806 --> 01:34:28.416
Thank you.

1509
01:34:28.691 --> 01:34:32.495
Was there no hot water in the thermos?

1510
01:34:32.779 --> 01:34:35.523
Oh, no, I like it this way.

1511
01:34:35.623 --> 01:34:36.524
Oh...

1512
01:34:36.624 --> 01:34:37.700
What is that?

1513
01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:39.093
Milo sludge.

1514
01:34:39.193 --> 01:34:41.788
"Milo sludge"?

1515
01:34:42.346 --> 01:34:44.632
Very amusing.

1516
01:34:45.016 --> 01:34:50.021
It must be like eating mud or something.

1517
01:34:50.121 --> 01:34:52.090
Her father likes it, too.

1518
01:34:52.190 --> 01:34:53.891
You don't say.

1519
01:34:53.991 --> 01:34:56.878
Ah!!!

1520
01:34:56.978 --> 01:34:59.655
I got it! I
got it! I got it!

1521
01:34:59.755 --> 01:35:01.491
Got what?

1522
01:35:01.591 --> 01:35:03.860
What the dirt is!

1523
01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:12.935
Hey, Gas! What do you think this is?

1524
01:35:14.729 --> 01:35:15.530
Dirt.

1525
01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:17.323
Absolutely not!

1526
01:35:18.241 --> 01:35:19.600
This here is...

1527
01:35:19.909 --> 01:35:21.961
instant swamp!

1528
01:35:23.965 --> 01:35:27.658
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.


1529
01:35:27.875 --> 01:35:32.396
This is swamp mud converted to dirt.

1530
01:35:32.747 --> 01:35:34.282
You're nuts.

1531
01:35:34.382 --> 01:35:38.369
Add water to this...
and you get a swamp!


1532
01:35:39.178 --> 01:35:42.381
Spare me, please.
I've come this far.


1533
01:35:42.481 --> 01:35:46.460
"This far"?
Have you any idea where you are?


1534
01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:52.975
Mt. Fuji's 5th stage? 9th stage?
Who knows?


1535
01:35:54.085 --> 01:35:55.786
God help me.

1536
01:35:56.087 --> 01:35:58.915
There was indeed a swamp here.

1537
01:35:59.015 --> 01:36:01.909
See? What'd I tell you?

1538
01:36:02.301 --> 01:36:03.778
So what?

1539
01:36:03.978 --> 01:36:09.575
This map is from the Edo period,
early 1700's.


1540
01:36:10.701 --> 01:36:14.464
Hey, yeah. This swamp is gone, right?

1541
01:36:14.564 --> 01:36:15.940
That's right.

1542
01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:16.996
Right?

1543
01:36:17.096 --> 01:36:18.860
So what?

1544
01:36:19.110 --> 01:36:23.739
So if we move forward
a little more in time...


1545
01:36:24.198 --> 01:36:26.067
Ah, things weren't easy.

1546
01:36:26.167 --> 01:36:27.602
No, they weren't.

1547
01:36:27.702 --> 01:36:29.297
Not in the Edo Period.

1548
01:36:29.447 --> 01:36:31.205
Not in the Edo Period.

1549
01:36:31.305 --> 01:36:32.148
Right?

1550
01:36:32.248 --> 01:36:33.324
Right.

1551
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:40.222
Oh, the native people's festival temple.

1552
01:36:40.690 --> 01:36:43.651
Native people's festival.

1553
01:36:48.381 --> 01:36:53.327
I'm guessing you like this kind
of stuff, eh Miss?


1554
01:36:53.427 --> 01:36:55.429
Don't be so lewd.

1555
01:36:55.529 --> 01:36:56.714
She does.

1556
01:36:56.814 --> 01:36:58.065
Quiet!

1557
01:37:01.366 --> 01:37:04.747
Ah, finally! Look here!

1558
01:37:04.847 --> 01:37:10.611
This is a Tempo period village map.
No swamp here.


1559
01:37:10.711 --> 01:37:13.414
Just an open field, like today.

1560
01:37:13.773 --> 01:37:16.167
<i>"Year of Tempo 8, June 6"
- Ah, this is it!</i>


1561
01:37:16.267 --> 01:37:18.261
Bingo!

1562
01:37:18.361 --> 01:37:20.062
Hooray.

1563
01:37:22.156 --> 01:37:24.216
This is the swamp.

1564
01:37:24.450 --> 01:37:26.410
Right! I'm taking it home.

1565
01:37:26.635 --> 01:37:27.762
Are you serious?

1566
01:37:27.862 --> 01:37:31.757
Of course. This is my swamp!

1567
01:37:31.857 --> 01:37:35.836
The swamp I brought for a million yen.

1568
01:37:36.604 --> 01:37:37.964
How do we do this?

1569
01:37:40.908 --> 01:37:42.443
Parcel postage?

1570
01:37:42.543 --> 01:37:44.754
Oh, box it up, fill out slips.

1571
01:37:44.854 --> 01:37:46.088
Hey!

1572
01:37:46.681 --> 01:37:48.616
You're strange.

1573
01:37:48.716 --> 01:37:53.821
Come on, Gas.
You can drive a truck, right?


1574
01:37:53.921 --> 01:37:56.824
Look, just forget it, all right?

1575
01:37:57.133 --> 01:37:59.585
No, I'm definitely taking it.

1576
01:37:59.785 --> 01:38:01.887
Be rational.

1577
01:38:02.563 --> 01:38:05.708
Don't talk to me about rational,
punk rocker!


1578
01:38:05.808 --> 01:38:07.109
Say what?

1579
01:38:07.209 --> 01:38:08.819
You're a punk rocker!

1580
01:38:08.919 --> 01:38:13.057
You're supposed to be irrational!
So be irrational!


1581
01:38:14.075 --> 01:38:15.668
Shut up!

1582
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.393
Fine! Who needs you!?

1583
01:38:24.616 --> 01:38:28.397
Go home! You jerk!

1584
01:38:38.332 --> 01:38:40.584
What's with her, anyway?

1585
01:39:18.781 --> 01:39:24.120
It's a sand quarry.
High quality mountain dirt.


1586
01:39:37.992 --> 01:39:40.770
<i>Why am I so gung-ho about this?</i>

1587
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:46.108
<i>Is it just anger at my father?
Or added anger at Gas?</i>


1588
01:39:46.375 --> 01:39:51.113
<i>At any rate, it's going home.
I don't care, I'm sending it all.</i>


1589
01:39:51.639 --> 01:39:53.114
One, two...

1590
01:39:57.311 --> 01:40:00.881
Ah! Give me a break!

1591
01:40:00.981 --> 01:40:02.625
Poop!

1592
01:40:15.705 --> 01:40:17.456
Come on.

1593
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:20.776
Come on! Come on!

1594
01:40:40.546 --> 01:40:42.873
Parcel collection service!

1595
01:40:47.244 --> 01:40:51.232
You're an okay guy, really.
Not cut out for Punk, perhaps?


1596
01:40:51.332 --> 01:40:54.318
Quit your yapping. Anyhow,
what're you going to do with all this?


1597
01:40:54.418 --> 01:40:55.963
Return it to it's real state.

1598
01:40:56.063 --> 01:40:57.588
Then what?

1599
01:40:57.688 --> 01:40:59.849
I'll feel good.

1600
01:41:00.049 --> 01:41:01.941
Like father, like daughter.

1601
01:41:02.041 --> 01:41:03.044
Excuse me?

1602
01:41:03.144 --> 01:41:04.954
Just like Light Bulb.

1603
01:41:05.054 --> 01:41:06.664
Hardly.

1604
01:41:06.914 --> 01:41:10.459
Ultra-super special ultimate selfish.

1605
01:41:10.559 --> 01:41:12.820
Here! My mom's place.

1606
01:41:24.346 --> 01:41:26.242
Keep it coming!

1607
01:41:31.648 --> 01:41:32.673
I'm dumping.

1608
01:41:32.773 --> 01:41:34.466
Please.

1609
01:41:44.017 --> 01:41:45.313
Oh, watch out!

1610
01:41:48.614 --> 01:41:49.753
Wow.

1611
01:41:52.393 --> 01:41:55.062
Over here, please!

1612
01:41:55.262 --> 01:41:56.588
What now?

1613
01:41:59.314 --> 01:42:00.535
Come on.

1614
01:42:02.561 --> 01:42:03.657
Here goes!

1615
01:42:04.488 --> 01:42:05.723
Ready?

1616
01:42:06.074 --> 01:42:08.634
- I suppose.
- Spread it to there.


1617
01:42:08.734 --> 01:42:11.637
From about here to there.

1618
01:42:11.737 --> 01:42:14.707
Okay, spread! Get to it.

1619
01:42:14.807 --> 01:42:15.709
Let's do this!

1620
01:42:15.809 --> 01:42:16.984
Ugh.

1621
01:42:17.885 --> 01:42:21.088
Come on. Get a move on!

1622
01:42:21.188 --> 01:42:22.873
I am.

1623
01:42:24.024 --> 01:42:25.345
So much to do!

1624
01:42:35.594 --> 01:42:37.755
It's very swamp-like.

1625
01:42:37.855 --> 01:42:39.640
That's nice.

1626
01:42:39.765 --> 01:42:41.592
Right! Now for water!

1627
01:42:41.767 --> 01:42:43.360
Isn't that enough?

1628
01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:48.591
What? After all this work, you don't
want to see it become a swamp?


1629
01:42:48.766 --> 01:42:52.670
It's like instant noodles
without hot water!


1630
01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:53.646
Is it?

1631
01:42:53.746 --> 01:42:54.915
Yes, it is.

1632
01:42:55.015 --> 01:42:56.165
So, where do we get water?

1633
01:42:56.265 --> 01:42:57.850
How should I know?

1634
01:42:58.025 --> 01:43:00.769
- Mineral water?
- That'll take forever!


1635
01:43:01.053 --> 01:43:02.738
Ah! I know!

1636
01:43:02.838 --> 01:43:04.014
What?

1637
01:43:04.114 --> 01:43:08.127
Remember what that jerk
Light Bulb said?


1638
01:43:08.436 --> 01:43:10.112
Not again.

1639
01:43:11.906 --> 01:43:14.645
Open up the faucet full blast.

1640
01:43:14.745 --> 01:43:16.945
Yes, yes, yes!

1641
01:43:17.878 --> 01:43:18.996
Huh?

1642
01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:22.149
Oops.

1643
01:44:26.922 --> 01:44:30.000
Hey! Couldn't you hold it down?

1644
01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:31.644
Do I have to?

1645
01:44:31.744 --> 01:44:34.480
Instead of spacing out.

1646
01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.048
You do it.

1647
01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:43.096
Now what?

1648
01:44:47.393 --> 01:44:49.595
Hey, cut that out!

1649
01:44:49.695 --> 01:44:51.397
Stay alert.

1650
01:44:53.472 --> 01:44:57.695
<i>Boomdiada, boomdiada.
Boomdiada, boomdiada.</i>


1651
01:44:57.795 --> 01:45:01.072
- What're you singing?
- Mountain song.


1652
01:45:01.673 --> 01:45:05.227
<i>Boomdiada, boomdiada.
Boomdiada, boom....</i>


1653
01:45:05.327 --> 01:45:06.495
Stop that.

1654
01:45:06.595 --> 01:45:07.763
Why?

1655
01:45:07.863 --> 01:45:10.182
It's depressing.

1656
01:45:11.934 --> 01:45:13.852
I said, knock it off!

1657
01:45:14.995 --> 01:45:16.905
Yes, sir...

1658
01:45:29.334 --> 01:45:30.778
Trade places?

1659
01:45:31.078 --> 01:45:33.046
No, I'm fine!

1660
01:45:33.271 --> 01:45:34.573
Good.

1661
01:45:47.678 --> 01:45:52.023
Gas! The swamp's done!

1662
01:45:54.449 --> 01:45:55.495
What?

1663
01:46:00.646 --> 01:46:02.042
Oh...

1664
01:46:03.001 --> 01:46:04.953
Instant swamp, huh?

1665
01:46:05.103 --> 01:46:06.888
What do you think?

1666
01:46:10.451 --> 01:46:12.077
Looks good.

1667
01:46:12.678 --> 01:46:14.321
It's swampier than I expected.

1668
01:46:14.421 --> 01:46:18.892
You see?
It's a pretty good looking swamp.


1669
01:46:18.992 --> 01:46:20.152
Yeah.

1670
01:46:20.602 --> 01:46:23.956
Not that it means anything.

1671
01:46:24.289 --> 01:46:25.958
Yeah, I second that.

1672
01:46:42.441 --> 01:46:44.192
What next?

1673
01:46:46.353 --> 01:46:48.864
Clean it up, I guess.

1674
01:46:50.157 --> 01:46:53.235
Leave it. It'll dry on its own.

1675
01:46:53.485 --> 01:46:54.911
True.

1676
01:47:01.226 --> 01:47:02.461
What's up?

1677
01:47:02.728 --> 01:47:08.233
I don't know. I just thought
it would be kind of special, but...


1678
01:47:08.808 --> 01:47:10.602
it's no big deal.

1679
01:47:13.263 --> 01:47:17.809
The fact that you made it, I guess,
is pretty special.


1680
01:47:19.127 --> 01:47:21.580
That's pretty cool.

1681
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.818
Shall I turn off the water?

1682
01:47:26.918 --> 01:47:29.771
No, that's okay. 
I'll go myself.

1683
01:47:31.423 --> 01:47:33.826
Thanks for everything.

1684
01:47:33.926 --> 01:47:35.460
Don't sweat it.

1685
01:47:36.612 --> 01:47:39.597
Sorry I dragged you into this.

1686
01:47:42.467 --> 01:47:45.770
That's okay.
Besides it had its fun moments.


1687
01:47:46.263 --> 01:47:48.799
Really? It was fun?

1688
01:47:48.924 --> 01:47:50.517
Yeah, it was.

1689
01:47:54.371 --> 01:47:56.715
- Say, Gas?
- Yeah?


1690
01:47:58.083 --> 01:48:01.086
I... I mean, you...

1691
01:48:02.161 --> 01:48:03.433
Huh?

1692
01:48:03.633 --> 01:48:05.334
- Hmm?
- Eh!?


1693
01:48:07.309 --> 01:48:08.627
What the...?

1694
01:48:28.497 --> 01:48:31.533
Ow ow ow! It's real! It's real.

1695
01:48:47.374 --> 01:48:49.568
Wait!

1696
01:48:49.668 --> 01:48:51.443
Hang on!

1697
01:48:57.726 --> 01:49:01.063
Ti-hya-mo-chai.

1698
01:49:07.227 --> 01:49:08.787
What was that?

1699
01:49:12.024 --> 01:49:14.126
The swamp king?

1700
01:49:14.901 --> 01:49:16.376
It looked like...

1701
01:49:18.096 --> 01:49:19.321
a dragon?

1702
01:49:21.908 --> 01:49:22.851
Not a dragon.

1703
01:49:22.951 --> 01:49:25.503
But you saw it, right?

1704
01:49:26.805 --> 01:49:28.590
Yeah, I did.

1705
01:49:28.690 --> 01:49:31.518
Well, I saw it, too. A dragon.

1706
01:49:31.718 --> 01:49:36.682
Hey!? I saw a dragon!
For the very first time!


1707
01:49:36.782 --> 01:49:38.150
Me, too!

1708
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:41.394
Yes!!

1709
01:49:49.828 --> 01:49:51.104
What's this?

1710
01:49:56.822 --> 01:49:58.691
Oh crap!

1711
01:50:06.917 --> 01:50:09.538
Ah!

1712
01:50:15.339 --> 01:50:17.035
Oh my...!

1713
01:50:18.265 --> 01:50:20.286
Argh!!

1714
01:50:36.562 --> 01:50:37.576
Enough!

1715
01:50:37.701 --> 01:50:39.427
Ah, I've had it!

1716
01:50:46.753 --> 01:50:47.925
Oh!?

1717
01:50:48.025 --> 01:50:50.175
Hey! Get out here.

1718
01:50:51.331 --> 01:50:53.091
What are you hollering about?

1719
01:50:53.191 --> 01:50:55.761
Dragon! A flying dragon!

1720
01:50:55.861 --> 01:50:57.229
Don't be silly.

1721
01:50:57.329 --> 01:50:59.197
No, it's true. A dragon!

1722
01:50:59.297 --> 01:51:03.577
Stop daydreaming, and earn
us some money.


1723
01:51:03.677 --> 01:51:04.611
But it's a dragon!

1724
01:51:04.711 --> 01:51:06.138
We can't eat a dragon!

1725
01:51:06.238 --> 01:51:08.106
That would be taboo!

1726
01:51:08.774 --> 01:51:10.375
You tick me off.

1727
01:51:10.817 --> 01:51:14.429
Anger makes me hungry.
You charlatan!


1728
01:51:14.970 --> 01:51:16.095
Oh!

1729
01:51:23.146 --> 01:51:25.296
<i>Rope 'em in!</i>

1730
01:51:25.396 --> 01:51:29.747
<i>Rope 'em in!
Rope 'em in!</i>


1731
01:51:31.196 --> 01:51:32.080
Morning.

1732
01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:35.200
<i>- About time you got up.
- Lassoes in front of Gotanda station!!</i>


1733
01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:38.545
You were the one in a coma
all this time.


1734
01:51:38.645 --> 01:51:40.180
Ah, nasty tongue.

1735
01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:43.316
A lot happened while you were asleep.

1736
01:51:43.416 --> 01:51:45.493
- Like what?
- I'm not telling.


1737
01:51:45.593 --> 01:51:47.095
Why not?

1738
01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:50.281
Anyways, just don't do anything
stupid again.


1739
01:51:50.448 --> 01:51:51.800
Stupid?

1740
01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:54.594
Why'd you go water sprite fishing?

1741
01:51:54.694 --> 01:51:56.822
'Cause you didn't believe me.

1742
01:51:56.922 --> 01:51:59.758
Know how much trouble that caused?

1743
01:51:59.858 --> 01:52:05.663
Sometimes you've got to find out
something, whatever the cost.


1744
01:52:05.964 --> 01:52:09.450
I'd like to sink
you in a swamp myself.

1745
01:52:10.135 --> 01:52:14.122
But you were saved.
All's well that ends well.


1746
01:52:14.222 --> 01:52:15.957
You betcha.

1747
01:52:16.107 --> 01:52:19.511
Listen, I know you'll have trouble
believing this but...


1748
01:52:19.611 --> 01:52:23.382
I was saved by a dragon.

1749
01:52:23.698 --> 01:52:27.957
- What?
- I was sinking into a dark hole...


1750
01:52:28.086 --> 01:52:32.340
when a large dragon flew overhead
and grabbed me with his big paw.


1751
01:52:32.933 --> 01:52:35.477
And I suddenly awoke...

1752
01:52:35.685 --> 01:52:40.290
inside a large plastic tent.
Am I a melon? I thought.


1753
01:52:40.465 --> 01:52:44.026
So that dragon was real, after all.

1754
01:52:44.444 --> 01:52:46.321
Huh? What did you say?

1755
01:52:46.421 --> 01:52:47.572
What?

1756
01:52:47.906 --> 01:52:50.182
- You believe?
- Why?


1757
01:52:50.282 --> 01:52:52.686
Since when did you start to believe?

1758
01:52:52.786 --> 01:52:55.013
Who cares when?

1759
01:52:57.983 --> 01:53:00.127
Huh? What's in the box?

1760
01:53:00.227 --> 01:53:01.520
A water sprite.

1761
01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:04.798
I caught it this morning to show you.

1762
01:53:04.998 --> 01:53:06.224
Come on.

1763
01:53:19.045 --> 01:53:22.415
Hey, is this Gonzaburo?

1764
01:53:22.565 --> 01:53:25.343
A man from the rabbit farm delivered it.

1765
01:53:25.568 --> 01:53:28.188
How did he know?

1766
01:53:29.489 --> 01:53:33.118
"The clue was on
the bottom of his feet."

1767
01:53:36.345 --> 01:53:38.465
<i>"Let's take a souvenir picture of today!!"</i>

1768
01:53:39.558 --> 01:53:42.560
No wonder.

1769
01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:45.730
Now that's the impossible.

1770
01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:50.435
Gonzaburo.

1771
01:53:50.685 --> 01:53:53.129
Gonzaburo!

1772
01:53:54.272 --> 01:53:55.740
Right?

1773
01:53:59.077 --> 01:54:01.004
- Sorry.
- You're late.


1774
01:54:01.104 --> 01:54:02.180
Ah, thanks.

1775
01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:06.159
<i>Until I could get my antique store
up and running again...</i>


1776
01:54:06.259 --> 01:54:09.562
<i>I decided to help Gas with his work.</i>

1777
01:54:12.499 --> 01:54:14.756
<i>"Gasu Electric Works Co."
- Excuse me.</i>


1778
01:54:22.017 --> 01:54:23.178
Okay.

1779
01:54:25.095 --> 01:54:27.045
Careful of the high voltage wires.

1780
01:54:27.145 --> 01:54:28.886
Roger! Gotcha!

1781
01:54:32.194 --> 01:54:36.039
<i>I still don't know what emerged
from that swamp.</i>


1782
01:54:36.139 --> 01:54:39.301
<i>But I think it
was a dragon, after all.</i>

1783
01:54:39.759 --> 01:54:43.572
No, I'm sure it was a dragon.

1784
01:54:45.465 --> 01:54:47.258
<i>It's Amaya-kun!</i>

1785
01:54:48.309 --> 01:54:52.605
- How about raw oysters?
- Raw oysters?


1786
01:54:52.705 --> 01:54:55.707
But I've got food poisoning
in the past from eating them.


1787
01:54:56.158 --> 01:54:57.833
How about lobsters, then?

1788
01:54:57.933 --> 01:54:58.804
Lobsters?

1789
01:54:58.904 --> 01:55:02.638
- Oh, a water sprite.
- Look! What a cute house!


1790
01:55:02.989 --> 01:55:04.165
Come on.

1791
01:55:04.890 --> 01:55:07.325
- I'd love to live in a house like that.
- Really?


1792
01:55:07.425 --> 01:55:08.600
Yeah.

1793
01:55:15.362 --> 01:55:16.938
Let's get started.

1794
01:55:17.355 --> 01:55:18.855
Yeah, let's.

1795
01:55:22.327 --> 01:55:25.088
It is a dragon.

1796
01:55:27.532 --> 01:55:30.435
Gas, do you know what we saw?

1797
01:55:30.535 --> 01:55:32.162
No, I don't.

1798
01:55:34.789 --> 01:55:36.032
Listen!

1799
01:55:37.659 --> 01:55:41.596
Most things in the world are insignificant.

1800
01:55:41.721 --> 01:55:47.160
Most people laugh
way more than they cry.


1801
01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:49.954
