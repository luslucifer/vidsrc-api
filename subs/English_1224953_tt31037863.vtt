1
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.635
This is going to be so sick.

2
00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.137
- Luke, everything going good?
- Yeah.


3
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:17.245
All right.

4
00:00:17.412 --> 00:00:19.581
Three, two, one. Action!

5
00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.718
From the very first
days of the project,


6
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:37.307
we've been talking about viewers
all over the world, especially kids,


7
00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:41.770
to see in them the hero
that they hope to be.


8
00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:46.858
The world of Percy Jackson
is an incredible canvas.


9
00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:50.987
It demands that it have
the kind of execution


10
00:00:51.154 --> 00:00:53.156
that I think we've
all committed to.


11
00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:56.159
Growing up with such
an iconic series…


12
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.246
it's insane being able
to bring that to life.


13
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.650
This is a big story.

14
00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.835
I mean, dare I say epic?
That's a good Greek word.


15
00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:07.170
What is happening right now?

16
00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:12.383
These books ask us to
consider big things.


17
00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:17.097
Where are we from and where are we
going? Can we take the risk to want?


18
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.282
Oh, my gosh, this is so cool.

19
00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:19.849
That was amazing.

20
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.976
I've never seen
anything like this.


21
00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.145
He was so committed all season.

22
00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.982
This story turned into something
bigger than I had ever anticipated.


23
00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:33.947
We are embarking on the biggest
adventure any of us have ever been on.


24
00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:46.352
Welcome to you all. Welcome
to New York Comic Con,


25
00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:48.503
I hope you feel the love.
You guys feeling good?


26
00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:50.564
- Yeah, thank you so much.
- Hey, everybody!


27
00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:56.575
John and Dan, let's
start with you guys…


28
00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:02.016
There are 180 million copies of
Percy Jackson sold around the world.


29
00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:05.645
That responsibility to the fan
base was a lot of pressure.


30
00:02:05.812 --> 00:02:08.148
Rick and Becky
Riordan, everybody!


31
00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:16.739
And to have Rick, the
author, who has, you know,


32
00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:19.284
given 20 years of his
life to this material,


33
00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:21.911
right in the center,
building this with us,


34
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.913
it was essential.

35
00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:26.541
It was crucial. It was…

36
00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.060
It was gonna make the difference

37
00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:30.378
of this working or not working.

38
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:40.305
We're at the Volume
stage at Mammoth Studios,


39
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:41.791
and we're doing
the camera tests.


40
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.809
I'm excited. Everything
looks awesome so far.


41
00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:46.436
I'm excited to start filming.

42
00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:51.649
This was never a project that I wanted
to do just because I wanted to do it.


43
00:02:51.774 --> 00:02:56.321
It was more about the fans that
have read the books over the years.


44
00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:59.157
I knew that there was this
sort of pent-up demand


45
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.160
for a really faithful
adaptation of the stories.


46
00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:05.181
It's been a bit of a journey for
him too, to finally see these things


47
00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:09.375
realized in a way that feels right to
him, that feels like it's doing justice


48
00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.794
to the story that he's spent
so much of his life with.


49
00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:16.341
Really, it started as a
bedtime story for my son,


50
00:03:16.591 --> 00:03:18.968
when he was feeling not
so great about himself


51
00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:20.595
because of his
learning differences.


52
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.140
He loved Greek mythology and
I told him all these stories


53
00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:25.892
and I made up Percy Jackson.

54
00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:29.812
It was really because he wanted
to see a character like himself


55
00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:34.067
who had ADHD and dyslexia,
but was also a hero.


56
00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:38.738
It's crazy how it went from
the bedtime story 20 years ago,


57
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:40.073
to here we are.

58
00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:44.887
When we started this process,

59
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:48.957
we knew in casting Percy, Annabeth,
and Grover, we had a tall order.


60
00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:51.894
It's always a challenge. So
many people have read this book


61
00:03:51.918 --> 00:03:54.587
and everybody has their own
idea about what they look like.


62
00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:58.007
For us, it was really about trying to
find the soul of all of these people.


63
00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:00.218
And finding Walker, I think,

64
00:04:00.301 --> 00:04:02.262
was the moment we all knew
this was going to work.


65
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.224
I had a couple calls with
the producers, Dan and John,


66
00:04:06.307 --> 00:04:08.027
and I thought I wasn't
going to get anymore.


67
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:10.061
And Rick joined,

68
00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:13.940
and then he told me himself,
with Becky, that I got the part.


69
00:04:14.357 --> 00:04:15.900
Which was really cool.

70
00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:19.529
He really embodies what
it means to be Percy.


71
00:04:19.737 --> 00:04:23.533
He has a sense of humor.
He has Percy's snark.


72
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.451
Also his sense of wonder.

73
00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:30.164
I wish I had been that good at
his age. He's really wonderful.


74
00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:36.415
He is the real deal. He is
talented. He is so hardworking.


75
00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:41.551
He is so playful.
He's a delight.


76
00:04:41.634 --> 00:04:43.845
Thank you.

77
00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:47.432
This is a story of a trio and
how they play off of each other.


78
00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:51.602
Everyone has their moments of
doubt, their moment of humor,


79
00:04:51.853 --> 00:04:53.580
their moment of
emotional struggle.


80
00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:54.689
Who's there?

81
00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:56.858
- Mrs. Jackson, it's Grover.
- Grover?


82
00:04:56.941 --> 00:04:59.581
This is a little time sensitive.
Could someone maybe open the door?


83
00:04:59.652 --> 00:05:03.948
I sent in a tape, like, partly as a joke.
I was convinced I wasn't gonna get it.


84
00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:06.951
'Cause this is like
such an iconic show.


85
00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:08.679
You know, you really
want to do it justice.


86
00:05:08.703 --> 00:05:10.343
- Across. Leah.
- Huh? Leah.


87
00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:11.664
Or Leia.

88
00:05:11.873 --> 00:05:15.418
My audition process
was a lot of auditions.


89
00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:20.340
I started off, I was,
like, flirting with… him.


90
00:05:20.423 --> 00:05:22.717
Like, "I like your
sword, oh, my gosh,


91
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.695
- "like, that's so cool."
- You had to do that?


92
00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.071
- I had to do that.
- What?


93
00:05:26.095 --> 00:05:27.975
I think it's the first
time I'm hearing of this.


94
00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:31.601
Individually, you know,
they're all incredible.


95
00:05:31.684 --> 00:05:34.604
But if the chemistry between the three
didn't work, the show doesn't work.


96
00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:39.817
And Walker, Leah, and Aryan just
had that perfect chemistry fit.


97
00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:45.239
I'm Andrew McIlroy, and
I'm the acting coach


98
00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:47.700
on Percy Jackson season one.

99
00:05:48.034 --> 00:05:50.745
And this is where we talk
about what the story is,


100
00:05:51.162 --> 00:05:54.957
where we try to coax their
imaginative life out of them,


101
00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:59.462
and try to build Percy Jackson into
a world that sits in their spine,


102
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.340
in their imagination,
all things Percy.


103
00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:05.051
And the group has come
together incredibly well.


104
00:06:05.134 --> 00:06:07.220
Leah, Aryan, Walker.

105
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.710
- Andrew…
- Super cool.


106
00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:10.032
- Yeah. He's super funny.
- He's very smart.


107
00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:11.241
Andrew is just the best.

108
00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:14.185
I don't know what I would
do if I didn't have him.


109
00:06:14.268 --> 00:06:15.436
He's honest with me.

110
00:06:15.645 --> 00:06:17.831
They don't just say, "Oh, that was great,"
even when they don't think it's great,


111
00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:19.041
and then they cut
the scene, you know?


112
00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:20.858
…each other. 
And so, for the…

113
00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:24.487
It took us no time at all
to actually build a group,


114
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.073
to build an ensemble. They've
been teasing each other,


115
00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:29.176
they've been working in
character with each other.


116
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.370
It's very hard to believe that
they don't know each other.


117
00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:38.126
One of the things we like to say is
fill in all the stuff between the lines


118
00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:41.254
and, you know, have the actors like
walking the walk and talking the talk.


119
00:06:41.712 --> 00:06:43.607
- I gotta tell him about Kronos.
- Lovely.


120
00:06:43.631 --> 00:06:45.359
It's not like we're just
throwing it out there.


121
00:06:45.383 --> 00:06:48.052
Every single line means something,
and it's not just a throwaway.


122
00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:49.637
What's the word for glory?

123
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.721
- Kleos.
- Kleos.


124
00:06:50.805 --> 00:06:52.306
So where's the glory
in that, right…


125
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.600
There is nothing that's
mentioned in this book


126
00:06:54.684 --> 00:06:57.979
that we can't actually point to
and say we know what that is,


127
00:06:58.354 --> 00:06:59.856
because there's not a word

128
00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.275
that I don't let the
actors have substantiated.


129
00:07:02.358 --> 00:07:05.318
Gorgeous. Do you see what I mean? It's
like, "What is it not to have that?"


130
00:07:05.403 --> 00:07:06.446
Yeah.

131
00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:09.508
A quest is a sacred thing.

132
00:07:09.532 --> 00:07:10.700
And to be charged with one

133
00:07:10.908 --> 00:07:13.578
is to be in conversation
with the gods themselves.


134
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.042
There is no way this is
what sacred smells like.


135
00:07:20.126 --> 00:07:22.128
We're soldiers on a mission.
It's not a vacation.


136
00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:24.273
The fun to be had in a journey

137
00:07:24.297 --> 00:07:26.799
like this is every time you turn
around, you're somewhere new.


138
00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:30.261
It really is a hero's
journey in every sense.


139
00:07:30.386 --> 00:07:32.013
And we're all across the map.

140
00:07:33.264 --> 00:07:36.350
There are a lot of challenges
in trying to figure out


141
00:07:36.434 --> 00:07:38.186
how you can actually do this.

142
00:07:38.311 --> 00:07:40.188
We're off to a rest
stop in New Jersey


143
00:07:40.396 --> 00:07:43.316
and then suddenly moving
through Middle America.


144
00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:45.193
We're at an abandoned water park

145
00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:48.988
and then we're in Las Vegas
at this massive casino.


146
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.823
And they all have to
be brought to life.


147
00:07:50.907 --> 00:07:52.909
To do that… …it takes a lot.

148
00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:54.827
It takes physical locations.

149
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:56.704
We also have
virtual environments


150
00:07:56.787 --> 00:07:59.499
brought to life by
Industrial Light and Magic.


151
00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:03.544
Scene one, take one,
day one, action.


152
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.630
That's a lot of ones.

153
00:08:06.464 --> 00:08:08.716
The Volume here in
Vancouver and StageCraft


154
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:10.718
is the first ever
Canadian Volume built.


155
00:08:10.885 --> 00:08:12.553
It is the game changer.
It's the future.


156
00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:14.805
This is the most advanced stuff

157
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:17.141
that's happening in
visual effects right now.


158
00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:19.536
Instead of having to travel
to all these locations,


159
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.960
we're bringing the
locations to us.


160
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:23.981
It's really cool. One
second, you're in New York,


161
00:08:24.065 --> 00:08:26.817
and the next second, you're

162
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:29.087
You can make it look like
you're anywhere in the world.


163
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:30.911
And it truly does. You
feel like you're there.


164
00:08:31.113 --> 00:08:32.990
Like, I feel like I'm
in the forest right now.


165
00:08:34.784 --> 00:08:38.538
Within the computer, all of
this exists as a 3D scene,


166
00:08:38.704 --> 00:08:41.374
which we can move around and
we can manipulate as we want.


167
00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.544
Sometimes it's something as
easy as moving a tree around.


168
00:08:44.752 --> 00:08:47.880
And it creates these backgrounds
that you're seeing in the camera.


169
00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:51.199
We mount tracking objects
on top of the camera


170
00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.928
to find out the exact tracking
position of where the camera is


171
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:56.573
in relation to the Volume, so that
we can project them on the walls.


172
00:08:56.597 --> 00:09:00.393
One of the big challenges is
blending the real with the virtual.


173
00:09:00.726 --> 00:09:04.021
The more physical set
you can have on the stage


174
00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:07.525
that handshakes with what's on
the Volume wall, the better it is.


175
00:09:08.234 --> 00:09:10.361
This is my dad.

176
00:09:10.486 --> 00:09:12.530
I'm Walker's dad. I don't
have a first name anymore.


177
00:09:12.697 --> 00:09:15.074
And this is his first
time on the Volume stage.


178
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.369
Yes. This is absolutely amazing.

179
00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:23.040
I'm excited to watch Walk-Man do
his magic here, on this stage.


180
00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:26.252
Can I get you anything? Fresh
pomegranate juice, a snack?


181
00:09:26.502 --> 00:09:28.337
It's truly amazing.

182
00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:30.798
You basically don't have
to use your imagination.


183
00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:34.093
Which is great for me because
I have none, whatsoever.


184
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.932
The world of Percy Jackson is
an incredible canvas for us.


185
00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:43.936
That alone brings excitement
because of the challenges.


186
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.523
And we can push this new
discipline of virtual production


187
00:09:47.607 --> 00:09:49.317
to way higher grounds.

188
00:09:50.192 --> 00:09:51.444
Car crash?

189
00:09:51.527 --> 00:09:54.864
Today is the Minotaur
car crash. Yeah.


190
00:10:01.203 --> 00:10:03.683
I'm going to spritz your
face. One, two, three.


191
00:10:04.832 --> 00:10:05.833
That's nice.

192
00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:09.503
Today, we have a Camaro
on a six-axis motion base


193
00:10:09.587 --> 00:10:11.339
that can move anywhere in space.

194
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:16.093
And it does so, similar to what this
scale model that we call a Waldo does.


195
00:10:16.719 --> 00:10:20.765
And we can move the Camaro around and
act like it's driving down the road


196
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.725
on the screens that
you see behind me.


197
00:10:23.893 --> 00:10:25.603
Yeah, I think it's
going to spin.


198
00:10:26.604 --> 00:10:27.924
I think they're
going to spin it.


199
00:10:28.564 --> 00:10:32.652
It was really my first introduction on
how tiring it can be to film on a set.


200
00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:35.154
They got to shake the car
around, and seeing like trucks


201
00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.031
and like the Volume stage,

202
00:10:37.114 --> 00:10:39.659
and glaring lights and the
rain and the water towers.


203
00:10:39.742 --> 00:10:40.826
It was fantastic.

204
00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:42.244
Here it comes. Hit!

205
00:10:51.504 --> 00:10:53.964
Cut!

206
00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:55.834
That was pretty fun.

207
00:10:56.092 --> 00:10:59.553
So we just finished the
first full week of filming.


208
00:10:59.887 --> 00:11:01.389
Yeah, this was a fun week.

209
00:11:01.472 --> 00:11:05.976
Can't wait for… the

210
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.814
- Morning.
- You gotta stand like this.


211
00:11:10.356 --> 00:11:12.316
- Morning.
- Power pose.


212
00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:14.777
It's real metal.

213
00:11:14.985 --> 00:11:16.445
It definitely is.

214
00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:19.198
- Also, it's totally deadly.
- Yes.


215
00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:21.001
This would not be
a good way to end.


216
00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:23.828
One of the biggest challenges
when you take a book


217
00:11:23.953 --> 00:11:26.288
and make it on the screen is
creating a plausible world.


218
00:11:26.622 --> 00:11:29.458
So from our props to our
costume to our set design,


219
00:11:29.542 --> 00:11:31.544
it had to be very
tangible, very real.


220
00:11:31.669 --> 00:11:35.881
The heads of departments on the
show are bringing their own ideas


221
00:11:35.965 --> 00:11:39.593
of what it means to inhabit the qualities
that these characters in the books do.


222
00:11:39.802 --> 00:11:43.264
And it lets the world
breathe from the bottom up.


223
00:11:43.764 --> 00:11:48.144
We had over 120 children
that we had to put armor on,


224
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.063
and tried to come
up with something


225
00:11:51.147 --> 00:11:54.191
that was reminiscent
of ancient Greek armor,


226
00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:58.154
but just modified the shape so that
the children would be able to wear it.


227
00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:01.073
Putting on my costume
for the first time


228
00:12:01.198 --> 00:12:05.369
really made me feel like, "Oh, yeah,
I'm a part of this now. I'm so ready."


229
00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:08.164
This came from Shein.
This came from…


230
00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:10.708
- Louis Vuitton.
- Yeah, Louis Vuitton.


231
00:12:10.791 --> 00:12:12.710
And this is Gucci.

232
00:12:12.835 --> 00:12:14.475
His stuff just came
from... I don't know.


233
00:12:15.171 --> 00:12:16.811
This is Goodwill.

234
00:12:16.922 --> 00:12:18.549
It's a ten-dollar
outfit, I think.


235
00:12:21.886 --> 00:12:24.680
When we were talking to the
props department about Riptide…


236
00:12:24.764 --> 00:12:27.683
Swords. Shields. Pen.

237
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.936
…I said, it has to be like
really, really plain looking,


238
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.813
like a 30-cent ballpoint pen.

239
00:12:32.938 --> 00:12:35.524
But they did put this
really cool detail.


240
00:12:35.649 --> 00:12:39.653
The guard on the pen cap is
shaped like the blade of Riptide.


241
00:12:39.862 --> 00:12:42.090
Well, don't tell anybody,
but I'm stealing that sword.


242
00:12:42.114 --> 00:12:45.826
I don't care what anybody
says. I'm taking that home.


243
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.079
We really found some
of the best people…


244
00:12:49.288 --> 00:12:51.016
…to bring this world to life.

245
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.251
Oscar-winning Dan Hennah, who did
Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit,


246
00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:58.506
is creating worlds like my
imagination could never go to.


247
00:12:59.882 --> 00:13:03.886
Today, we're in Asphodel,
with Asphodelians.


248
00:13:04.053 --> 00:13:06.448
You don't know which ones are
alive or which ones are mannequins.


249
00:13:06.472 --> 00:13:08.533
- And it is really freaky.
- Worst nightmare.


250
00:13:08.557 --> 00:13:12.478
If I saw a plastic one move or
something, I would have died.


251
00:13:13.646 --> 00:13:18.150
The key factor is finding the vision
of the director and being true to that.


252
00:13:18.609 --> 00:13:21.445
I tend to start off with
some concept artists


253
00:13:21.612 --> 00:13:25.324
and then set designers
do their magic.


254
00:13:25.407 --> 00:13:27.993
We are in stage four
at Mammoth Studios,


255
00:13:28.077 --> 00:13:31.205
building the Terminus
set for episode five.


256
00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:36.210
And what we're standing in will be
a 32,000 cubic foot tank of water


257
00:13:36.335 --> 00:13:40.089
where Percy and Annabeth come
to retrieve Ares's shield.


258
00:13:41.715 --> 00:13:43.008
There it is.

259
00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:47.221
So here we are at the
Terminus, amazing water set.


260
00:13:47.513 --> 00:13:48.514
A lot of fun.

261
00:13:48.597 --> 00:13:51.892
- Look at that. Best Jacuzzi ever.
- Oh, my God.


262
00:13:51.976 --> 00:13:54.270
Can I actually take a quick
dip at the end of the day?


263
00:13:54.353 --> 00:13:55.953
I wouldn't mind if you did that.

264
00:13:58.524 --> 00:14:01.277
Camp Half Blood, we
searched far and wide


265
00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:02.935
to find the right environment.

266
00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:06.574
And finally we walked into
this forest at Langley,


267
00:14:06.657 --> 00:14:08.576
which had all the
attributes we needed.


268
00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:11.328
And then we needed
to build our world.


269
00:14:11.996 --> 00:14:14.540
This has been about a
three-month process.


270
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.794
A lot of the work was bringing in
an incredible amount of greens,


271
00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:20.212
digging out this pond,

272
00:14:20.296 --> 00:14:25.509
basically taking Dan Hennah's concept
art and realizing it into this space.


273
00:14:26.093 --> 00:14:27.845
It came together so well.

274
00:14:27.928 --> 00:14:31.181
Just seeing all the cabins
in that "U" formation.


275
00:14:31.265 --> 00:14:34.518
It's so weird because I've been
imagining that since, like, third grade


276
00:14:34.685 --> 00:14:37.646
and then actually being
there and seeing that,


277
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.399
like walking in and doing
scenes in the cabin.


278
00:14:40.482 --> 00:14:43.694
It's just… it's... You
can't even describe it.


279
00:14:43.777 --> 00:14:45.005
It's really cool.

280
00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:47.197
Everyone. Your
attention, please.


281
00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:49.575
This is Percy Jackson.

282
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.078
I think the things that have
always made Percy feel different,


283
00:14:53.203 --> 00:14:56.081
it turns out once he's around
people who are like him…


284
00:14:56.165 --> 00:14:58.042
- I'm Luke.
- …he's not so unusual.


285
00:14:58.334 --> 00:15:01.378
Demigods just process
reality differently.


286
00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:04.023
For the first time in your life,
you're just like everyone else.


287
00:15:04.214 --> 00:15:07.134
Charlie, who plays Luke, is like
the big brother that everyone wants.


288
00:15:07.301 --> 00:15:09.136
And Walker immediately
looked up to him.


289
00:15:09.219 --> 00:15:13.307
This is a daily occurrence on set.
Trying to get the perfect dap.


290
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.452
One time we were at Camp Half
Blood, and we did it so much


291
00:15:15.476 --> 00:15:17.353
that I had like a
five-star print…


292
00:15:17.436 --> 00:15:18.955
…on my forearm.

293
00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:20.105
Charlie?

294
00:15:20.522 --> 00:15:22.942
Walker, wh… …what
are you doing here?


295
00:15:23.067 --> 00:15:24.627
- Oh, my God.
- Dude, it's been so long.


296
00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:25.819
It's been so...

297
00:15:27.863 --> 00:15:28.864
Yes.

298
00:15:29.448 --> 00:15:31.384
There's some wish fulfillment,
I think, in a story about a kid


299
00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:34.453
who's always felt different
finding a place where he fits in.


300
00:15:34.578 --> 00:15:37.206
I was a military brat,
so we moved around a lot.


301
00:15:37.289 --> 00:15:40.626
And so there's a lot of different schools,
and I always had to remake friends


302
00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:43.879
and I really connected with that while
I was reading the books, I think, so…


303
00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:45.732
He is fantastic as Percy.

304
00:15:45.756 --> 00:15:48.968
And he's lovely to work with
and he's a really great actor.


305
00:15:52.304 --> 00:15:56.892
Clarisse is a complicated one. She
is his nemesis at the beginning.


306
00:15:58.852 --> 00:16:01.981
She's the character that we all
love to hate, that's for sure.


307
00:16:02.648 --> 00:16:04.984
I just want you to admit
that you are a fraud.


308
00:16:08.404 --> 00:16:10.614
For Percy, she's a bit
like the sort of bullies


309
00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:12.258
he's used to dealing
with at school.


310
00:16:12.282 --> 00:16:14.868
But he sort of learns that he's
actually quite good at fighting.


311
00:16:15.202 --> 00:16:18.956
For us, that moment with Clarisse was
really the eye-opening moment for him,


312
00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:21.667
of all of the things he was
capable of and never knew.


313
00:16:25.254 --> 00:16:26.630
She can really scream.

314
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.191
- Oh, yeah.
- There was that one scene.


315
00:16:28.215 --> 00:16:30.467
It was like an opera
singer, it was amazing.


316
00:16:30.551 --> 00:16:33.429
If there was any glass near us,
I'm sure it would have shattered.


317
00:16:33.512 --> 00:16:35.723
No!

318
00:16:37.683 --> 00:16:39.852
Poseidon affects Percy's journey

319
00:16:39.935 --> 00:16:44.356
in that I think he sort of intervenes
at certain points, deliberately.


320
00:16:44.773 --> 00:16:47.067
And I mean, that's
all he can do, really.


321
00:16:48.485 --> 00:16:51.030
Water is an incredibly important
theme in the whole Percy series


322
00:16:51.113 --> 00:16:54.116
because Percy's dad is
Poseidon who is the sea god.


323
00:16:55.075 --> 00:16:56.869
Obviously, shooting
in water is not easy.


324
00:16:56.952 --> 00:16:59.788
We chose very much to shoot practically,
because I love the experience


325
00:16:59.872 --> 00:17:02.166
for the actor of being in
the environment of water.


326
00:17:11.842 --> 00:17:15.471
We're at a training
facility in Vancouver.


327
00:17:15.596 --> 00:17:18.932
This is where we've been working
with Walker, training him.


328
00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.643
- Hi.
- Two weeks of getting in in a costume.


329
00:17:21.727 --> 00:17:22.895
I know.

330
00:17:23.812 --> 00:17:25.892
- Look at you.
- It feels gross.


331
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.402
It feels like… well, cold because
I didn't like wearing wetsuits.


332
00:17:30.527 --> 00:17:31.945
I'm getting used to it.

333
00:17:33.655 --> 00:17:35.908
- There you go.
- Oh, dude.


334
00:17:36.366 --> 00:17:39.828
You don't think that wearing clothes
makes a big difference. It really does.


335
00:17:39.953 --> 00:17:41.806
Because you feel like
you're drowning, you know?


336
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.666
Wearing shoes underwater, like,
you can't really use your feet


337
00:17:44.792 --> 00:17:47.645
because it doesn't really like, work. You
can't kick. You have to use your arms.


338
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:49.421
At the beginning, it
was a little scary.


339
00:17:50.589 --> 00:17:54.218
We have put him through a
free-diving youth course.


340
00:17:54.802 --> 00:17:58.931
And he flew through it with flying colors.
He's very comfortable in the water.


341
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:01.225
And we're just layering skills

342
00:18:01.308 --> 00:18:04.103
so that they're able to
simply focus on performing.


343
00:18:11.944 --> 00:18:13.588
The commitment
for a 13-year-old,


344
00:18:13.612 --> 00:18:15.405
I have never seen
anything like it.


345
00:18:15.531 --> 00:18:16.824
He's put in a tank.

346
00:18:16.907 --> 00:18:20.369
He was underwater for most
of the day with scuba gear.


347
00:18:20.744 --> 00:18:22.454
And this is really
complicated work.


348
00:18:22.788 --> 00:18:25.916
So at the very beginning,
your left foot is trapped.


349
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:28.252
Your first instinct would
be, go to the surface.


350
00:18:28.377 --> 00:18:30.295
So you push off to the surface,

351
00:18:30.546 --> 00:18:33.549
boom, you're caught.
Then I'll say "Nereid."


352
00:18:33.757 --> 00:18:35.467
And that is what's
coming towards you.


353
00:18:36.093 --> 00:18:37.570
- Okay, so…
- And then we'll take...


354
00:18:37.594 --> 00:18:40.055
- How many times do I have to do the jump?
- Twice.


355
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.740
Twice.

356
00:18:41.807 --> 00:18:43.267
No turning back now.

357
00:18:47.813 --> 00:18:49.064
Okay. Here we go.

358
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.442
And it's on you, buddy.

359
00:18:56.446 --> 00:18:59.283
Holding your breath is
a difficult thing to do.


360
00:18:59.783 --> 00:19:03.120
But when you're doing it
without a mask, in costume,


361
00:19:03.245 --> 00:19:05.205
it is very, very difficult.

362
00:19:05.664 --> 00:19:07.791
And then you have to
perform on top of that.


363
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:13.714
Trust yourself. Just breathe.

364
00:19:16.592 --> 00:19:19.428
He would put the regulator
in, take the regulator out,


365
00:19:19.511 --> 00:19:22.681
and just stay underwater because
he wanted to get it right.


366
00:19:22.848 --> 00:19:25.267
It just says everything
about who Walker is.


367
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.810
Three, two, one, action.

368
00:19:28.645 --> 00:19:30.725
Working with the kids in
the water was awesome.


369
00:19:30.772 --> 00:19:33.001
We're noticing that like, "Oh, yeah,
we need to get out of this boat


370
00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:35.194
"before something
happens." That's when we…


371
00:19:35.819 --> 00:19:38.363
Coming to set, they knew the
pressure that was on them


372
00:19:38.447 --> 00:19:40.324
because if we
didn't get this take


373
00:19:40.407 --> 00:19:43.660
it would take another hour for
them to dry off and do a take two.


374
00:19:44.328 --> 00:19:46.622
So I just was real with them
because they're smart kids.


375
00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:48.349
I said, "You know what?
At the end of the day,


376
00:19:48.373 --> 00:19:50.667
"if we have to do that,
it's gonna be okay."


377
00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:52.711
Action. And jump!

378
00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:58.425
Yeah! And cut. 
Good job, guys.

379
00:19:58.508 --> 00:20:00.719
And they nailed it. I
was so proud of them.


380
00:20:00.802 --> 00:20:03.138
Yeah! It looks awesome!

381
00:20:06.391 --> 00:20:09.895
I know Leah had rehearsed in a pool
many times and I was so proud of her


382
00:20:09.978 --> 00:20:13.565
because she was nervous but committed.
And that's all you can ever ask.


383
00:20:14.399 --> 00:20:16.401
One thing I can say,
she's a hard worker.


384
00:20:16.568 --> 00:20:21.156
So, if anybody works harder than
Leah, that's something to see.


385
00:20:21.698 --> 00:20:26.745
She's a perfectionist. The
challenge is more of Leah proving


386
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.206
that this role is for her.

387
00:20:29.373 --> 00:20:31.458
Come on. Let's go find Percy.

388
00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:34.628
You know, proving the fact
that she's a wise girl.


389
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.547
She's tough. I
think it pushes her.


390
00:20:37.631 --> 00:20:40.425
I could come into her room at
night and she's studying her lines


391
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.303
and I'm asking her, "Leah,
what are you doing?"


392
00:20:43.387 --> 00:20:45.013
"I'm not Leah right
now. I'm Annabeth."


393
00:20:45.264 --> 00:20:48.025
I think the moment we met Leah,
it was one of those moments


394
00:20:48.141 --> 00:20:50.560
where a character that had only
really existed on the page,


395
00:20:50.644 --> 00:20:53.146
as far as the show goes,
started to come into focus.


396
00:20:53.313 --> 00:20:57.234
She has this sense of groundedness
to her that's really rare.


397
00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:00.070
She wants to do the
best job possible,


398
00:21:00.153 --> 00:21:04.741
and she is just laser-focused
on getting the role right.


399
00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:07.202
So when you got to us, you'd
be different than this.


400
00:21:07.536 --> 00:21:11.248
It's great to work with Leah. She's
exactly how I envisioned Annabeth.


401
00:21:11.331 --> 00:21:13.977
Annabeth is the most reasonable.
She keeps the group on track.


402
00:21:14.001 --> 00:21:15.419
She always is one step ahead.

403
00:21:15.502 --> 00:21:17.272
That's the big thing. She's
always one step ahead.


404
00:21:17.296 --> 00:21:19.589
And Leah does a phenomenal
job of playing it.


405
00:21:19.923 --> 00:21:23.302
I do feel like Annabeth
on and off of set.


406
00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:26.054
I've become this
character so much now


407
00:21:26.138 --> 00:21:28.390
that, like, I'm always
like, "Wait, who's that?


408
00:21:28.515 --> 00:21:30.642
"Wait, no. I hear
something. What is that?"


409
00:21:31.393 --> 00:21:35.147
There's a combination of
strength and cool to her.


410
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.417
I've really enjoyed sharing
this journey with Leah,


411
00:21:37.441 --> 00:21:38.942
in her journey with Annabeth.

412
00:21:39.609 --> 00:21:41.445
She's led with such prowess.

413
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.865
But also with a lot of vulnerability
where she's still learning


414
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.150
and where she's still finding
things out about herself.


415
00:21:47.492 --> 00:21:49.995
Power and glory and
nothing else matters.


416
00:21:51.872 --> 00:21:57.711
Ares is that way. Zeus is that
way. My mother is that way.


417
00:21:57.878 --> 00:22:02.591
But I don't want to
be that way anymore.


418
00:22:03.508 --> 00:22:05.510
Good, let's cut. Nice, Leah.

419
00:22:22.569 --> 00:22:25.947
Whatever we do, we have to make
sure this door does not open.


420
00:22:32.204 --> 00:22:34.182
They're not done with us.

421
00:22:34.206 --> 00:22:37.834
She's learning to hunt. And this
seems like the hunting part.


422
00:22:41.588 --> 00:22:42.839
You should run now.

423
00:22:43.673 --> 00:22:47.010
The challenge to creature
design on a show like this


424
00:22:47.094 --> 00:22:49.638
is these are creatures that have
existed for thousands of years.


425
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:51.973
There have been
endless interpretations


426
00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:54.226
of what the Chimera or
Minotaur looks like.


427
00:22:54.309 --> 00:22:56.019
It was important to
us as storytellers


428
00:22:56.103 --> 00:22:58.188
that every time you meet
a creature on this show,


429
00:22:58.271 --> 00:23:00.440
it feels like it could
only exist in this show.


430
00:23:00.524 --> 00:23:04.736
At the same time, adhering to the canon
of what that creature is mythologically.


431
00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:06.446
So it creates an
interesting puzzle.


432
00:23:06.655 --> 00:23:09.574
How do you do something new
without it feeling too new?


433
00:23:10.242 --> 00:23:13.203
A lot of that was attacked from the
same place that we attacked casting,


434
00:23:13.286 --> 00:23:15.330
which was just trying to
figure out who they were.


435
00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:18.500
And impart some level of humanity and
personality to all of these creatures


436
00:23:18.708 --> 00:23:19.908
and to let that then come out.

437
00:23:20.335 --> 00:23:23.130
Come with us and you
will suffer less pain.


438
00:23:23.463 --> 00:23:29.463
Hi, I'm Megan Mullally and I
play Mrs. Dodds, slash, Alecto.


439
00:23:29.886 --> 00:23:32.806
Mrs. Dodds? You okay?

440
00:23:32.889 --> 00:23:37.018
I come in as Mrs. Dodds,
the mean math teacher.


441
00:23:37.102 --> 00:23:38.395
We're not fools.

442
00:23:38.478 --> 00:23:42.983
I also turn into this monster
and try to eat them frequently.


443
00:23:43.233 --> 00:23:45.277
Where is it?

444
00:23:46.236 --> 00:23:48.780
The most fun part so far
has been that I get to fly.


445
00:23:51.491 --> 00:23:54.453
Let's get out of here,
please, while we still can.


446
00:23:55.203 --> 00:23:56.872
Not today, friends.

447
00:23:58.874 --> 00:24:01.376
It's a pleasure to meet
you, son of Poseidon.


448
00:24:01.877 --> 00:24:05.464
I'm Jessica Parker Kennedy,
and I'm playing Medusa.


449
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:10.051
This is my motion capture
hat, which you won't see.


450
00:24:10.177 --> 00:24:14.139
You'll see snakes. It'll be very
scary. I hope you're very, very afraid.


451
00:24:14.431 --> 00:24:20.020
When I ship your statues to Olympus,
maybe that will get my point across.


452
00:24:20.103 --> 00:24:22.606
Medusa, she's a
really fun character.


453
00:24:22.939 --> 00:24:26.651
Doing snakes adds a lot of challenge
because they all need to play together.


454
00:24:26.735 --> 00:24:30.113
You don't want to take away the
importance of the character either.


455
00:24:30.197 --> 00:24:33.658
So, it's kind of a
complementary actor in a way.


456
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.912
But it's all grounded to
reality and feels real.


457
00:24:38.163 --> 00:24:39.915
We'd seen a number
of iterations…


458
00:24:39.998 --> 00:24:41.142
…of a Minotaur

459
00:24:41.166 --> 00:24:44.628
that felt a little impersonal,
like that he was a monster only.


460
00:24:44.711 --> 00:24:46.588
We wanted to let him be someone

461
00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:48.733
who felt like he had a little
bit more personality than that.


462
00:24:48.757 --> 00:24:51.518
- He is brutal. He is relentless.
- He is wearing underpants.


463
00:24:53.261 --> 00:24:56.223
The Minotaur, we've been working
on that creature for quite a bit.


464
00:24:56.306 --> 00:24:58.159
Even before they started
shooting that sequence,


465
00:24:58.183 --> 00:25:01.686
we had to develop his character
and get all the detail on the face


466
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.188
and we have some close-ups.

467
00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:09.277
We have brought in the best of the
best to bring these things to life.


468
00:25:09.611 --> 00:25:11.112
Our lead partners at ILM,

469
00:25:11.321 --> 00:25:14.157
both in terms of helping us create
the world and the environments


470
00:25:14.282 --> 00:25:16.242
and helping us create a
number of these creatures…


471
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.538
…are doing it at a level
that's pretty astonishing to us


472
00:25:19.621 --> 00:25:23.375
in terms of what's possible and how real
these creatures can be made to feel.


473
00:25:30.423 --> 00:25:31.800
Oh, the new producer?

474
00:25:31.883 --> 00:25:35.220
Wow, I will be really, really,
really nice to you then.


475
00:25:35.554 --> 00:25:38.139
How long you been doing this?
This is your first day, or…


476
00:25:38.848 --> 00:25:42.310
I've been doing this for
about three to four minutes.


477
00:25:42.394 --> 00:25:44.187
Okay. Well, you're
doing great.


478
00:25:44.437 --> 00:25:45.998
What do you think of this
shot? Pretty good, huh?


479
00:25:46.022 --> 00:25:48.751
- I love it. I think this is amazing.
- You'll make this business…


480
00:25:48.775 --> 00:25:52.404
But let's just
completely change it.


481
00:25:52.612 --> 00:25:55.115
Copy. You're funny.

482
00:25:55.365 --> 00:25:56.408
How hard could this be?

483
00:25:57.742 --> 00:26:01.413
What's been the most fun part of
this show is these kids' enthusiasm


484
00:26:01.496 --> 00:26:03.496
for the stunt work.

485
00:26:04.082 --> 00:26:07.210
We have such a great stunt
team who are so collaborative.


486
00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:10.046
But Walker is obsessed.

487
00:26:10.213 --> 00:26:11.423
Bon voyage.

488
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.175
He lives for that hybrid
of, you know, stunt acting.


489
00:26:15.802 --> 00:26:17.562
He's great to work with
because he's athletic


490
00:26:17.637 --> 00:26:19.139
and he understands
the whole process.


491
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:23.059
When we try to explain to him what's
going on, he's miles ahead of us.


492
00:26:23.226 --> 00:26:24.227
Go!

493
00:26:26.187 --> 00:26:28.565
I have so much respect for
that kid. This is a long shoot.


494
00:26:28.773 --> 00:26:31.067
He is in, like, every single day

495
00:26:31.192 --> 00:26:33.903
and he still is able to
keep such a good energy.


496
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.197
Watching him get to
perform his own stunts,


497
00:26:36.406 --> 00:26:38.491
it's like watching your
kid at a sports game.


498
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.020
- Did you watch the playback?
- Is it cool?


499
00:26:49.044 --> 00:26:50.629
It's really cool.

500
00:26:52.047 --> 00:26:54.382
Right now I'm doing a stunt

501
00:26:54.466 --> 00:26:56.968
where I get to fall
off the St. Louis Arch.


502
00:26:58.261 --> 00:26:59.387
This is going to be so sick.

503
00:26:59.471 --> 00:27:02.199
- Luke's being a slack off.
- It's gonna be super fun.


504
00:27:02.223 --> 00:27:04.726
My name's Corbin. I'm
with the stunt team.


505
00:27:04.893 --> 00:27:07.270
This shot is hanging
through the hole


506
00:27:07.354 --> 00:27:09.939
and it's like a thousand feet
down there or whatever it is.


507
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:13.193
And he tries to get back
up on it, an arm on there,


508
00:27:13.276 --> 00:27:15.820
and he can't make it, and
he slips back down again,


509
00:27:15.904 --> 00:27:18.073
and then… …he falls down.

510
00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.259
- And then throw back.
- Yeah, there you go.


511
00:27:20.283 --> 00:27:21.385
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:22.535
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


513
00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:26.873
We're going to have him hooked up to
this machine, it's called a descender,


514
00:27:27.415 --> 00:27:29.709
and it's for dropping people.

515
00:27:30.752 --> 00:27:34.005
The way it works is
it has a motor here


516
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.134
for winding up this line
that's hooked to the performer.


517
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.055
So, you wind them up,
you let go of the brake,


518
00:27:42.138 --> 00:27:43.698
and all of a sudden…

519
00:27:43.973 --> 00:27:47.727
It's a lot of stuff going on at once,
you have to really pay attention.


520
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.440
The first transition.
There we go.


521
00:27:54.192 --> 00:27:58.446
Ready? And action!

522
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.663
So unfair.

523
00:28:07.163 --> 00:28:08.748
You never had a chance, did you?

524
00:28:08.915 --> 00:28:10.125
And drop!

525
00:28:16.548 --> 00:28:19.801
- Three, two, one, drop!
- Drop. Drop.


526
00:28:19.968 --> 00:28:21.553
Drop! Drop.

527
00:28:27.058 --> 00:28:28.202
Yeah.

528
00:28:28.226 --> 00:28:29.826
- Nice work.
- Nice.


529
00:28:32.355 --> 00:28:34.149
So this is where
we're picking up.


530
00:28:34.232 --> 00:28:36.860
I'll say "action" and then you
guys back up, take a couple steps,


531
00:28:36.943 --> 00:28:39.863
and then I'll say, "And
turn," and you turn and run.


532
00:28:39.946 --> 00:28:41.573
And then we're into your…

533
00:28:42.449 --> 00:28:45.285
- Are we doing that separately?
- No, we're doing it all in this. Yeah.


534
00:28:45.452 --> 00:28:47.328
- We're flying?
- Oh, yeah.


535
00:28:48.037 --> 00:28:49.706
There's a lot of running today.

536
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:52.584
We should do one take where we're
all just Tom Cruise running.


537
00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:54.335
- Yes.
- Hands spread.


538
00:28:54.419 --> 00:28:57.881
Aryan's about to be
snatched up by Cerberus.


539
00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:00.717
We're just like sprinting.

540
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.095
It's kind of like the scene from
Rocky 3 but not like it at all.


541
00:29:05.054 --> 00:29:07.766
We thought like, Cerberus was
just going to, like, grab Grover


542
00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:09.934
by the back of the clothes
and, like, swallow him.


543
00:29:11.186 --> 00:29:13.605
But in the previz, he
literally just eats him.


544
00:29:13.688 --> 00:29:16.566
He grabs him from
like, the waist up.


545
00:29:17.358 --> 00:29:18.401
It's scary.

546
00:29:24.616 --> 00:29:27.076
Ready, and turn!

547
00:29:27.202 --> 00:29:28.661
Go, go, go, go!

548
00:29:29.662 --> 00:29:31.098
This is pretty cool to watch.

549
00:29:31.122 --> 00:29:32.499
It's a little hard not to laugh

550
00:29:32.624 --> 00:29:34.435
because… …one second you're
running and I'm like,


551
00:29:34.459 --> 00:29:36.419
watching him run and
then he just gets…


552
00:29:39.088 --> 00:29:40.298
Grover!

553
00:29:45.053 --> 00:29:46.906
- Resetting.
- I wanna see the playback


554
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.283
- on that, that was actually really good.
- It looked good.


555
00:29:49.307 --> 00:29:51.059
Did you see that?
I was really fast.


556
00:29:51.184 --> 00:29:53.937
I mean, they should, like, charge
people to be able to do this.


557
00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.230
This is so much fun.

558
00:29:55.396 --> 00:29:57.190
It's a carnival ride.

559
00:29:57.273 --> 00:29:59.418
- It's a carnival ride.
- It's scary, it's great, it's amazing.


560
00:29:59.442 --> 00:30:00.652
This is my stunt double, Vesh.

561
00:30:01.653 --> 00:30:03.029
He's really cool. 
He's shredded.

562
00:30:05.657 --> 00:30:08.368
This is my first series regular
and this is my first project


563
00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:11.663
on a role as big as this
or as intensive as this,


564
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.583
so I had no idea… …what
I was signing up for.


565
00:30:15.667 --> 00:30:19.754
But in that first month of prep, it
was me working with a movement coach,


566
00:30:19.838 --> 00:30:22.924
learning how to walk like a
goat, and wirework, and stunts!


567
00:30:23.842 --> 00:30:26.511
All things I had never done
before. It was awesome.


568
00:30:26.636 --> 00:30:28.179
- Grover?
- Percy.


569
00:30:28.263 --> 00:30:30.849
Grover, why is there half
a goat in your pants?


570
00:30:31.683 --> 00:30:33.518
So, the important
thing is not to panic.


571
00:30:34.561 --> 00:30:40.561
He loves it every single day to be here,
to be on the set and to be working.


572
00:30:40.942 --> 00:30:42.443
Really zoom in on this.

573
00:30:42.694 --> 00:30:44.014
We are applying

574
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.907
the slobber of the
Cerberus three-headed dog.


575
00:30:47.991 --> 00:30:50.326
So this is Grover
coming out of the mouth.


576
00:30:50.493 --> 00:30:54.622
You are a bad, bad dog.

577
00:30:54.914 --> 00:30:57.375
No shower I take
will be long enough.


578
00:30:57.458 --> 00:30:58.778
I don't think you
need to shower.


579
00:30:59.586 --> 00:31:05.586
Aryan Simhadri is the heart of this
show. His warmth, his vulnerability.


580
00:31:08.136 --> 00:31:09.613
This seems dangerous.

581
00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:11.014
Oh, they'll be totally fine.

582
00:31:11.097 --> 00:31:12.337
I gave them a satyr's blessing,

583
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.826
so they'll be able to
reach the wilderness...


584
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.059
I meant for the people.

585
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.565
The first tape I saw of Aryan, I was,
like, rolling on the floor, laughing.


586
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.942
Yeah, I don't know, but
the animals are all set.


587
00:31:23.067 --> 00:31:26.487
He not only got the
humor, but he added to it.


588
00:31:26.613 --> 00:31:30.366
And he just brought out
Grover's personality.


589
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.078
I regret doing
that. Cut that out.


590
00:31:34.913 --> 00:31:38.249
That character needs empathy.
He needs heart, he needs soul.


591
00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:41.920
Aryan, he just exudes
it. It's just in him.


592
00:31:42.587 --> 00:31:44.297
Let alone that he's hilarious.

593
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.592
I'm really humble, and I'd have
to say I'm the best person on set.


594
00:31:47.926 --> 00:31:49.344
That is a very humble opinion.

595
00:31:49.552 --> 00:31:54.098
Yeah, I'm really modest, but I'm
just, like, so good at everything.


596
00:31:54.682 --> 00:31:56.100
- Whoo!
- Whoo!


597
00:31:56.184 --> 00:31:57.936
- Let's do this.
- Yeah!


598
00:31:58.019 --> 00:32:00.355
Let's make some
cinema really good.


599
00:32:04.567 --> 00:32:07.403
Aryan, I think flies
into Tartarus today, too.


600
00:32:07.612 --> 00:32:09.405
Don't you get dragged
into Tartarus today?


601
00:32:09.572 --> 00:32:10.990
That's later this
week. Never mind.


602
00:32:11.115 --> 00:32:13.368
Hey, are they dragging you
to the pits of hell today?


603
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:15.346
- Oh, no, that's later this week.
- No, that's later.


604
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.747
- What a crazy job we have.
- I know.


605
00:32:18.873 --> 00:32:22.377
One of the things we really count
on in working with our young actors


606
00:32:23.252 --> 00:32:27.090
is the support of their
own personal ecosystem.


607
00:32:27.256 --> 00:32:30.843
After a day of fire,
or sand, or wind…


608
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.721
…or this monster
or that monster…


609
00:32:33.972 --> 00:32:35.223
…slammed around in a car,

610
00:32:35.306 --> 00:32:36.849
after a day at work,

611
00:32:37.266 --> 00:32:40.853
it's really good to go home and
have somebody support the toll


612
00:32:40.979 --> 00:32:43.606
that imagination at
this level takes.


613
00:32:44.232 --> 00:32:46.609
- I'm so sorry, Mama.
- Look, and I bring her


614
00:32:46.693 --> 00:32:48.569
- to set every day.
- Uno, uno, uno, uno.


615
00:32:48.653 --> 00:32:51.280
In between scenes when
they're not on camera,


616
00:32:51.489 --> 00:32:53.783
the children come into a
school space that we've set up


617
00:32:53.866 --> 00:32:55.618
and they get to be normal kids.

618
00:32:55.827 --> 00:32:57.387
Oh, look, here they come.

619
00:32:59.831 --> 00:33:01.058
We weren't talking about you.

620
00:33:01.082 --> 00:33:02.309
Did you just hear,
like, loud noise…


621
00:33:02.333 --> 00:33:05.044
They get to do their schoolwork
and they get to play,


622
00:33:05.128 --> 00:33:07.130
and rest and relax and
interact with each other.


623
00:33:07.422 --> 00:33:11.467
So, basically, I am in eighth
grade and I'm learning algebra,


624
00:33:11.551 --> 00:33:15.596
but, right now, I am
learning... solving equations.


625
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.400
What's your favorite
subject, Leah?


626
00:33:17.432 --> 00:33:18.474
Math.

627
00:33:18.808 --> 00:33:21.477
The main thing we want to do
is even though they're working,


628
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:25.732
is we want to keep their
childhood as intact as possible


629
00:33:25.815 --> 00:33:28.568
in this kind of crazy
industry that we work in.


630
00:33:28.693 --> 00:33:31.112
It's for a physics
project at school.


631
00:33:32.655 --> 00:33:33.882
And a lot of the schooling

632
00:33:33.906 --> 00:33:35.408
can be tailored to
their interests...


633
00:33:35.533 --> 00:33:37.660
I mean, Walker loves
the camera department.


634
00:33:37.744 --> 00:33:40.384
Every time I lose him, I know he's
going to be in the camera truck.


635
00:33:40.455 --> 00:33:43.058
And he wants to learn from them,
he wants to learn how to do camera.


636
00:33:43.082 --> 00:33:44.250
Draw on mic.

637
00:33:44.792 --> 00:33:47.104
So we're going to integrate
that into his schooling


638
00:33:47.128 --> 00:33:50.631
so that we don't always have to
pull him from what he loves on set


639
00:33:50.715 --> 00:33:52.175
and put him into a room.

640
00:33:52.925 --> 00:33:55.053
I really messed
this up just now.


641
00:33:55.261 --> 00:33:57.930
They do work a lot of
hours when they're a lead


642
00:33:58.097 --> 00:33:59.557
and that's quite intensive.

643
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.977
These are long days,
and to me it's important


644
00:34:03.144 --> 00:34:09.144
as teachers that we create a space
where kids can be kids on set.


645
00:34:10.902 --> 00:34:12.695
- Fire!
- Fire.


646
00:34:17.825 --> 00:34:19.265
You have the right
to remain silent.


647
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:22.163
Your all... All your...
If you say anything…


648
00:34:22.497 --> 00:34:25.208
It will be... Anything and
everything will be held against you


649
00:34:25.291 --> 00:34:26.643
- in a court of law.
- …in a court of law.


650
00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:27.811
You have the right
to an attorney.


651
00:34:27.835 --> 00:34:29.796
Did you learn this from
watching 21 Jump Street?


652
00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:30.963
Yes.

653
00:34:37.553 --> 00:34:40.556
There's a lot of fun to be
had throughout the show,


654
00:34:40.681 --> 00:34:43.935
but there's also a level
of emotion and intensity


655
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.104
that requires an epic score.

656
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.760
My name is Bear McCreary.

657
00:34:48.815 --> 00:34:50.775
I am the lead composer
at Sparks and Shadows,


658
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.237
and together we are the composers
for Percy Jackson and the Olympians.


659
00:34:54.487 --> 00:34:57.341
Here I am on the scoring stage,

660
00:34:57.365 --> 00:35:00.243
recording original
music for Percy Jackson,


661
00:35:00.493 --> 00:35:02.662
which in many ways
is a dream come true.


662
00:35:04.497 --> 00:35:07.333
Percy Jackson is a
really dynamic series.


663
00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:09.376
Some of the scenes that
were the biggest challenge


664
00:35:09.418 --> 00:35:10.962
were actually the
intimate scenes.


665
00:35:11.087 --> 00:35:13.065
There were a lot of scenes
with Percy and his mother


666
00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:16.592
where he's trying to
be vulnerable with her.


667
00:35:17.176 --> 00:35:19.929
I wanted to make sure
that the emotion is there.


668
00:35:20.221 --> 00:35:24.350
You… are not broken.

669
00:35:25.893 --> 00:35:28.563
At the same time, we're going
to end with a big battle.


670
00:35:28.646 --> 00:35:29.897
So I also needed to make sure

671
00:35:30.022 --> 00:35:32.859
that the score had some sort
of cinematic propulsion.


672
00:35:37.572 --> 00:35:40.992
And it's something that we used to
create a really dynamic experience


673
00:35:41.075 --> 00:35:42.326
when you're watching.

674
00:35:50.168 --> 00:35:51.854
Excellent, let's take a ten.

675
00:35:51.878 --> 00:35:53.796
Nicely done,
everybody. Nicely done.


676
00:35:58.301 --> 00:35:59.969
Oh, hey.

677
00:36:00.386 --> 00:36:01.512
Slushie machine.

678
00:36:01.888 --> 00:36:05.600
Not something you'd
usually see on set.


679
00:36:05.808 --> 00:36:07.728
Unless, you know, one of
the producers is buying.


680
00:36:10.104 --> 00:36:11.355
- Hey.
- Casino set.


681
00:36:11.522 --> 00:36:13.417
- This is awesome.
- We haven't had time to explore.


682
00:36:13.441 --> 00:36:15.711
- There's a slushie machine!
- There's a slushie machine.


683
00:36:15.735 --> 00:36:17.135
- There's like four of them.
- Yeah.


684
00:36:17.445 --> 00:36:19.840
They built this mall and then
they never ended up using it.


685
00:36:19.864 --> 00:36:21.782
And so we just built
this whole set here.


686
00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:23.326
Lotus Casino.

687
00:36:23.451 --> 00:36:25.661
It's huge. There's like
working escalators.


688
00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:27.848
It's a big hurdle to
clear when a book says


689
00:36:27.872 --> 00:36:30.791
it's a place that seems so fun and
so engrossing we never want to leave,


690
00:36:30.875 --> 00:36:33.377
and then you got to go
produce that, and they did it.


691
00:36:33.461 --> 00:36:36.589
Would it be unprofessional if
we just hung out here for a bit?


692
00:36:37.089 --> 00:36:38.299
Yes, yes, yes.

693
00:36:38.466 --> 00:36:42.220
Today we're in a
casino with 400 people.


694
00:36:42.303 --> 00:36:44.531
It is a lot of
people here today.


695
00:36:44.555 --> 00:36:47.558
Okay, I just stepped out the
elevator and suddenly I'm in Vegas.


696
00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:50.436
This is crazy. I kind
of want to move in.


697
00:36:50.937 --> 00:36:54.482
Another thing we added to
the Lotus Casino, Hermes.


698
00:36:54.649 --> 00:36:56.651
Who was your first
choice for Hermes?


699
00:36:57.693 --> 00:36:59.028
We got him.

700
00:37:02.198 --> 00:37:04.408
Hey, demigods. Welcome.

701
00:37:05.743 --> 00:37:09.330
Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton,
he's the coolest guy ever.


702
00:37:09.664 --> 00:37:13.334
We spent, like, a week watching
Hamilton to prepare to meet him.


703
00:37:13.751 --> 00:37:15.294
Gods require maintenance.

704
00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:17.338
Okay.

705
00:37:17.421 --> 00:37:19.173
As Lin's going to the table,

706
00:37:19.257 --> 00:37:21.509
look around behind you as
well, going "Where are we?


707
00:37:21.592 --> 00:37:23.386
- "What just happened?"
- Zap.


708
00:37:23.469 --> 00:37:25.179
Hmm. Okay. All right.

709
00:37:25.263 --> 00:37:29.517
Being with Lin-Manuel, it was amazing.
He was very chill. He was very funny.


710
00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.145
And like, he made me laugh like,
a million, gazillion times.


711
00:37:33.312 --> 00:37:34.355
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

712
00:37:34.605 --> 00:37:37.066
- I'm here with…
- Lin-Manuel Miranda.


713
00:37:37.275 --> 00:37:40.152
And I'm going to be interviewing
him in the Lotus Hotel Casino.


714
00:37:40.278 --> 00:37:42.530
This may take
forever. Literally.


715
00:37:43.406 --> 00:37:47.201
I didn't know much about Greek
mythology until I started reading


716
00:37:47.326 --> 00:37:48.512
- these books with my kids.
- Yeah.


717
00:37:48.536 --> 00:37:51.455
I really fell in love with
all of the different myths,


718
00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:53.958
really via Rick's
incredible writing


719
00:37:54.083 --> 00:37:56.711
and the way he wove
these original characters


720
00:37:57.044 --> 00:37:59.714
into the tapestry that
is Greek mythology.


721
00:37:59.964 --> 00:38:02.550
Come join us. You kids
know how to play craps?


722
00:38:02.633 --> 00:38:04.833
It's so cool that you're here
to be able to play Hermes.


723
00:38:04.927 --> 00:38:06.929
- Like perfect casting. Honestly.
- Oh, thanks.


724
00:38:07.096 --> 00:38:10.242
- How do you identify with Hermes?
- There's something really fun


725
00:38:10.266 --> 00:38:12.476
about Hermes 'cause he's
really hard to pin down.


726
00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.520
He's a trickster god,
he's the god of commerce,


727
00:38:14.645 --> 00:38:17.273
he's the god of everything
that goes down in this casino.


728
00:38:17.732 --> 00:38:20.085
He's just kind of the god of a
lot of different little things.


729
00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:22.296
- He's always doing something.
- And that's how I feel, too.


730
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.000
That's a good way
to put it. Yeah.


731
00:38:24.113 --> 00:38:25.948
And that's a wrap on Lin!

732
00:38:28.993 --> 00:38:31.245
This was the happiest two
days of my life, thank you.


733
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:34.165
Lin-Manuel Miranda is
the coolest guy ever.


734
00:38:34.248 --> 00:38:37.126
That's all I have to say.
He's the coolest dude ever.


735
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:42.882
- Hi, I'm Walker Scobell, and this is…
- Adam Copeland.


736
00:38:43.049 --> 00:38:46.469
Who would win a wrestling
match between you and me?


737
00:38:47.678 --> 00:38:50.139
I mean, do you want
the real answer?


738
00:38:50.973 --> 00:38:52.893
We'll go with a draw. I
don't wanna embarrass you


739
00:38:52.933 --> 00:38:54.893
- in front of these guys.
- Sure, sure.


740
00:38:55.144 --> 00:38:56.384
When I first got here,

741
00:38:56.687 --> 00:38:58.165
that's all I could think
about is Ares' fight.


742
00:38:58.189 --> 00:39:00.149
I'm going to be
fighting Adam Copeland.


743
00:39:00.232 --> 00:39:02.777
That's like career goals.
I mean, that's awesome.


744
00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:08.449
My name is Adam Copeland, and I
am playing Ares, the god of war.


745
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:09.941
He's a wrestler, right?

746
00:39:09.992 --> 00:39:13.162
Everyone's like, "You should be
scared of him in the show," right?


747
00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:16.499
I don't even have to act scared,
I'm scared in real life of this guy.


748
00:39:16.582 --> 00:39:18.501
- That is awesome.
- That's awesome.


749
00:39:18.584 --> 00:39:21.212
He is one of the coolest people
I've ever met in my life.


750
00:39:21.295 --> 00:39:24.423
He plays such a mean character,
but he's so nice in real life.


751
00:39:24.507 --> 00:39:26.300
My armpits are so happy.

752
00:39:26.384 --> 00:39:28.403
Really nice person. He's like
a squirrel. Like a little...


753
00:39:28.427 --> 00:39:29.821
- He's a sweetheart.
- That doesn't sound right.


754
00:39:29.845 --> 00:39:32.324
- I mean… Like…
- A really ripped, six-foot-four squirrel.


755
00:39:32.348 --> 00:39:33.628
He's a huge chipmunk.

756
00:39:33.682 --> 00:39:35.393
Single combat.

757
00:39:36.394 --> 00:39:39.480
When you hear that you're
going to be doing a battle


758
00:39:39.563 --> 00:39:42.483
with a 13-year-old, I was like,
"Okay, how's that going to work?"


759
00:39:42.608 --> 00:39:46.612
Because usually I'm playing
off of very large human beings.


760
00:39:46.904 --> 00:39:47.988
But it's been great.

761
00:39:48.072 --> 00:39:49.758
Nice! One more time.
Just like that.


762
00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.515
A lot of this stuff has
been pretty physical.


763
00:39:56.539 --> 00:39:58.809
Like I've been whipping him
around, he's like a bobblehead.


764
00:39:58.833 --> 00:40:00.459
But no complaints,

765
00:40:00.543 --> 00:40:03.963
he just powers through and he's
also having a blast. And so am I.


766
00:40:04.088 --> 00:40:06.066
I think it's crazy
seeing it come together


767
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:09.218
and I think it's going to be difficult,
but it's going to be pretty awesome.


768
00:40:12.721 --> 00:40:15.558
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, okay, let's do that.


769
00:40:16.016 --> 00:40:18.727
What does the hero's journey
in Percy Jackson mean to you?


770
00:40:19.103 --> 00:40:23.399
So, I love watching the progression.
The hero becoming the hero.


771
00:40:23.482 --> 00:40:28.279
And you always have to have a great
villain to pull those layers out.


772
00:40:29.113 --> 00:40:32.366
So that's been fun with this
season, is I get to be that villain.


773
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.885
We've done the fight

774
00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:35.262
a couple times, but
we added a new beat.


775
00:40:35.286 --> 00:40:37.788
He has to, like, push me against
the ground with the sword.


776
00:40:38.164 --> 00:40:41.459
And he like drags me across the
beach, and it's really scary.


777
00:40:41.542 --> 00:40:44.336
I'm not scared of the
stunt, I'm scared of Adam.


778
00:40:59.143 --> 00:41:00.811
This battle sets the tone.

779
00:41:00.936 --> 00:41:02.813
It's what the whole
first season builds to.


780
00:41:03.272 --> 00:41:06.484
It has to feel epic and
it has to feel huge.


781
00:41:07.276 --> 00:41:10.988
And it's the first inclination
we get of what Percy becomes.


782
00:41:11.238 --> 00:41:13.782
This bit, this bit, I love
this. "Whoa, whoa. Whoa"


783
00:41:13.908 --> 00:41:15.284
- That's cool.
- That's cool.


784
00:41:16.285 --> 00:41:19.622
The hero's journey is what
makes the entire story.


785
00:41:19.747 --> 00:41:22.541
It's seeing this young
boy blossom into a man.


786
00:41:22.917 --> 00:41:26.795
So that's really exciting to see Walker
take this thing and make it his own


787
00:41:26.879 --> 00:41:28.881
and then see the change happen.

788
00:41:29.632 --> 00:41:30.841
It's fun.

789
00:41:31.467 --> 00:41:33.385
That was cool.

790
00:41:34.303 --> 00:41:36.222
I'm excited to see how
this plays together.


791
00:41:36.847 --> 00:41:39.016
I'm pretty tired, but…

792
00:41:40.684 --> 00:41:42.102
I could do a little bit more.

793
00:41:42.853 --> 00:41:47.900
Yeah. I mean, I love filming,
but I also love sleeping in.


794
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.864
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

795
00:41:54.114 --> 00:41:58.953
♪ Happy birthday, dear Walker ♪

796
00:41:59.495 --> 00:42:01.622
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

797
00:42:01.747 --> 00:42:03.499
For next season to be
a little bit shorter.


798
00:42:03.707 --> 00:42:06.669
Keep going.

799
00:42:06.794 --> 00:42:08.271
Those are never gonna go out.

800
00:42:08.295 --> 00:42:11.215
I don't think these
ones will go out.


801
00:42:11.298 --> 00:42:14.969
For Walker, even though this
is... It is really hard work,


802
00:42:15.261 --> 00:42:18.347
it's long work, but he loves
it. So, for him, it's fun.


803
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:22.226
Every second he is up there
working, he's having fun.


804
00:42:22.726 --> 00:42:25.145
So that makes it, that
makes it work for him.


805
00:42:28.232 --> 00:42:30.312
From day one, he said,
I want to be an actor.


806
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:33.028
But okay, like, let's
start with something small,


807
00:42:33.112 --> 00:42:34.113
let's start with a play.

808
00:42:34.238 --> 00:42:37.700
And he had passion for that, and
then he went to an acting class.


809
00:42:37.783 --> 00:42:39.451
And as momentum built,

810
00:42:39.577 --> 00:42:42.538
we would help him open the doors, but
he had to go through it on his own.


811
00:42:44.748 --> 00:42:46.584
As a parent, it was
emotional for me


812
00:42:47.042 --> 00:42:50.546
because you see a kid find the
thing that he's supposed to do


813
00:42:50.629 --> 00:42:51.922
at such a young age.

814
00:42:52.172 --> 00:42:53.340
As an adult, like, I'm 45

815
00:42:53.465 --> 00:42:55.694
and I'm still looking for
the thing I'm supposed to do.


816
00:42:55.718 --> 00:42:58.053
But he finds it, and not
only do they find it,


817
00:42:58.137 --> 00:43:01.181
they find it and have so much
passion and desire to learn.


818
00:43:01.265 --> 00:43:05.269
And you realize like the
gift for someone at that age


819
00:43:05.352 --> 00:43:11.317
to have… to get an education
in every aspect of film.


820
00:43:11.692 --> 00:43:13.852
Go for a walk.

821
00:43:15.487 --> 00:43:17.132
See if you can go
out to the lake.


822
00:43:17.156 --> 00:43:19.325
Easy now, keep two hands on it.

823
00:43:19.533 --> 00:43:24.121
To be here and to get to
watch my son find this


824
00:43:24.204 --> 00:43:27.499
and become… Sorry.

825
00:43:27.583 --> 00:43:32.546
Who he's becoming has been the
greatest gift I could ever ask for.


826
00:43:41.055 --> 00:43:45.017
One of the things I really,
really loved about this project


827
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.520
was it began with words on a page,
and the words came to be on a page


828
00:43:48.937 --> 00:43:50.856
because a father was
trying to help his son


829
00:43:50.939 --> 00:43:52.299
feel more comfortable
in the world.


830
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:57.988
Which then became the script
for a television series,


831
00:43:58.155 --> 00:44:02.868
which then became a gathering
place, a campfire, if you will,


832
00:44:03.035 --> 00:44:06.372
around which an incredibly
talented group of people


833
00:44:06.455 --> 00:44:10.834
and an incredibly talented group
of young actors came together


834
00:44:10.918 --> 00:44:16.918
to begin our hero's journey towards
the making of Percy Jackson.


835
00:44:17.883 --> 00:44:19.426
- How far she's come.
- Yeah.


836
00:44:19.677 --> 00:44:22.680
When we started this
almost a year ago now,


837
00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:26.600
these kids were already
incredibly talented.


838
00:44:26.725 --> 00:44:30.145
Now, somehow,
they're even better.


839
00:44:30.312 --> 00:44:33.482
I have watched these
three kids grow up


840
00:44:33.565 --> 00:44:38.821
and become more than who they were when
we started, and it's really exciting.


841
00:44:38.904 --> 00:44:40.656
I'm very glad to
be a part of it.


842
00:44:40.823 --> 00:44:44.827
They all work from the soul,
they all work from the heart,


843
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.372
and they all want to live
and breathe their characters.


844
00:44:49.039 --> 00:44:50.416
At the beginning of the season,

845
00:44:50.499 --> 00:44:52.626
Percy didn't want to accept
anything about the gods.


846
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:55.879
I was like a child,

847
00:44:56.004 --> 00:44:59.925
and at the end I feel like Percy
feels like an adult, you know?


848
00:45:00.217 --> 00:45:02.010
I feel like he
accepts growing up.


849
00:45:02.594 --> 00:45:04.430
I'm done running from monsters.

850
00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:08.016
It's about going through the
process of letting people in


851
00:45:08.183 --> 00:45:09.893
and developing those
kinds of relationships


852
00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.938
which are more complicated
than just finding somebody


853
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:14.421
who knows what it's
like to be you.


854
00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:17.860
But it is also, I think, a story about
the strength of their own humanity.


855
00:45:18.569 --> 00:45:20.612
Percy is about this unit.

856
00:45:20.779 --> 00:45:24.742
These three amazing kids
who have to work together.


857
00:45:25.159 --> 00:45:27.039
And it's the same thing
that was with this show.


858
00:45:27.828 --> 00:45:30.998
Every single individual
in this room…


859
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.794
said, "We are all
in" and meant it.


860
00:45:36.712 --> 00:45:39.131
And we all knew we were a
part of something magical,


861
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.633
and relatable, and important.

862
00:45:42.676 --> 00:45:45.554
This has been quite
an epic adventure


863
00:45:45.637 --> 00:45:48.724
just in the making of Percy
Jackson and the Olympians.


864
00:45:49.016 --> 00:45:52.686
And again, we go back to
the genesis of the story


865
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.606
which began, I think,
from a place of goodwill.


866
00:45:56.064 --> 00:46:00.360
And that's what I've been finding
the entire way through this show,


867
00:46:00.778 --> 00:46:03.071
that spirit of goodwill.

868
00:46:03.322 --> 00:46:07.201
No matter what happens, we
meet back here next year.


869
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.662
All of us. Right here.

870
00:46:11.538 --> 00:46:14.917
These kids have grown
up in so many ways.


871
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.919
Just personally as individuals,

872
00:46:17.169 --> 00:46:21.882
as team members, as leaders of
this show, and as performers.


873
00:46:21.965 --> 00:46:23.717
And it all started with a book

874
00:46:24.176 --> 00:46:28.055
that 180 million people
around the world adore.


875
00:46:28.847 --> 00:46:31.183
We have a responsibility
to what this book means


876
00:46:31.266 --> 00:46:32.935
and what it's trying to say.

877
00:46:33.936 --> 00:46:37.689
I took the job because of
a little boy named Liam.


878
00:46:37.856 --> 00:46:39.107
He's my godson.

879
00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:42.861
And he said, "Virginia, what
have you been doing today?"


880
00:46:42.945 --> 00:46:46.114
And I said, "I made this
audition tape for this show."


881
00:46:46.198 --> 00:46:47.574
And he said, "What? What show?"

882
00:46:47.658 --> 00:46:50.244
And I was like, "Oh, it's this
thing called Percy Jackson."


883
00:46:50.452 --> 00:46:53.997
We were walking down a
street in Queens, he stopped…


884
00:46:55.541 --> 00:47:00.796
and his whole body changed and,
like, tears filled his eyes.


885
00:47:01.296 --> 00:47:02.714
And it was at that moment

886
00:47:02.798 --> 00:47:06.051
I thought, "Oh, my God, this
is really important to people


887
00:47:06.134 --> 00:47:08.720
"and this is really
important to someone I love.


888
00:47:09.304 --> 00:47:13.433
"And I want to be a
part of telling a story


889
00:47:13.517 --> 00:47:16.687
"that makes that child
respond in that way."


890
00:47:16.895 --> 00:47:18.313
So that's why I'm here.

891
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.315
The books are
really special to me


892
00:47:20.399 --> 00:47:24.403
because it felt good to have
them on, like, a really bad day


893
00:47:24.486 --> 00:47:25.654
or when things were hard.

894
00:47:25.904 --> 00:47:31.904
I have ADHD and I loved how
they empowered kids with ADHD.


895
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.373
I think I've reread all
of them six times so far.


896
00:47:36.456 --> 00:47:38.375
I enjoyed them a
lot in third grade


897
00:47:38.458 --> 00:47:40.544
and I still enjoy them
now, rereading them.


898
00:47:41.295 --> 00:47:45.507
I feel like it makes me realize that
I can achieve really great things


899
00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:47.384
in my life, and like,

900
00:47:47.467 --> 00:47:51.263
I don't have to, like, be someone
like, super important or anything.


901
00:47:51.513 --> 00:47:53.140
And that's good enough.

902
00:47:53.223 --> 00:47:55.118
As you can tell, it
takes more than a village


903
00:47:55.142 --> 00:47:57.603
to create something as
epic as Percy Jackson.


904
00:47:57.769 --> 00:47:59.855
Thank you for making this
an amazing panel, guys.


905
00:47:59.938 --> 00:48:01.064
Give it up one more time…

906
00:48:01.148 --> 00:48:02.858
…for Percy Jackson…

907
00:48:02.941 --> 00:48:04.586
It's really critical for me

908
00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:07.362
that viewers all over the
world can look at this show


909
00:48:07.863 --> 00:48:13.785
and say, "I could be Annabeth
Chase or Percy Jackson or Grover."


910
00:48:14.036 --> 00:48:17.664
And to see you can be a hero
no matter what you look like,


911
00:48:17.789 --> 00:48:19.917
no matter what your
personal challenges are,


912
00:48:20.417 --> 00:48:22.127
no matter where you come from.

913
00:48:22.711 --> 00:48:26.882
What it's really about is tapping
into the best that's inside us,


914
00:48:27.507 --> 00:48:28.967
drawing on that,

915
00:48:29.718 --> 00:48:34.097
and doing what we know needs to
be done in those hard moments.


916
00:48:35.432 --> 00:48:39.311
And hopefully, getting to
do what needs to be done


917
00:48:40.103 --> 00:48:42.314
with some great
friends around you.


918
00:48:47.277 --> 00:48:49.196
Ow, Aryan, you're on my foot.

919
00:48:49.279 --> 00:48:51.949
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
