1
00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:27.965
For the last nine months,
I singlehandedly saved my company


2
00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:31.925
from being ravaged by Wall Street.

3
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.805
I mean, these jackals
want our pension fund.


4
00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:40.350
I'm talking poison pills,
scorched earth, killer bees.


5
00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:45.686
And I'm pumping Nancy fucking Reagan
to anybody who'll listen.


6
00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:50.610
Now, do they appreciate it?
Nancy fucking Reagan. Do they?


7
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.840
Fuck no. They turn it around,
and say I'm the problem.


8
00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:01.097
That I'm stifling progress.
I'm stifling progress?


9
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.977
Bullshit, you're shitting me.
I mean, they're shitting me.


10
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:05.911
Come on.

11
00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:09.798
A man can only
take so much, you know?

12
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.272
Maybe you're right.

13
00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:18.257
Maybe it's time for old Mikey
to move on. Yeah.


14
00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.832
But to what? I don't know. You know.

15
00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:27.217
I mean, what do you do? 
What do you do?

16
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.187
What do you do?

17
00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:36.492
I don't... I don't think you can deal
what it is I do.


18
00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.799
What? Hey, look, man.

19
00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:41.550
Whatever it is you're doing,
I can do it too, okay?


20
00:01:41.654 --> 00:01:44.386
I mean, I'm tired
of this corporate bullshit.


21
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.922
I wanna feel free.

22
00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:51.241
I wanna win the Super-Bowl, you know?
At least I wanna get a stab at it.


23
00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:54.711
I think you might just have to.

24
00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:59.748
I'm just drunk enough to talk
about this shit. Okay...


25
00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:04.373
Frank, tell me
what my new profession is.


26
00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:07.222
When do I start,
and let me at it.

27
00:02:07.813 --> 00:02:09.858
Contract killer.

28
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.131
Hey, where's my gun?

29
00:02:17.357 --> 00:02:21.303
You're fucking... yeah, fucking right.

30
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:27.158
The people you meet.
You're not a contract killer, come on.


31
00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:33.403
Not that I believe that you are,
but, hey, between you and me?


32
00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:36.952
It was kind of a secret fantasy of mine
when I was little, you know?


33
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.391
Hit man, the secret agent man, you know.

34
00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.134
Two things I always wanted...

35
00:02:46.238 --> 00:02:49.095
wanted to do, but...

36
00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:54.336
I ended up in that six by six
foot fluorescent cubicle.


37
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.373
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay...
Let's just say, hypothetically,


38
00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:03.599
you are a contract killer. Okay?

39
00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:06.101
You're a contract killer.

40
00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:09.105
You've obviously had a little bit to drink,
but let's just entertain this notion,


41
00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.609
just for a second, okay?
How do I get into the biz?


42
00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:17.913
I don't know any contract killers
that actually want to be contract killers.


43
00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:21.217
There's no satisfaction in what we do.

44
00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:26.645
Some people trade services for a living,
others trade commodities, we trade both.


45
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.322
Our services are our time,
effort, and skill.


46
00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.818
The commodity is human life.

47
00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:39.181
That was freaking well-said, man.
I'm no dummy, and that was well-said.


48
00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:41.504
I'm gonna be a hitman.
I mean, a contract killer.


49
00:03:41.608 --> 00:03:45.003
It sounds more professional.
Okay? I'm gonna be one.


50
00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:46.955
Bang bang!

51
00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:51.346
Oh, we got a new job.

52
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.158
So...

53
00:03:53.658 --> 00:03:55.612
let me ask you this:

54
00:03:56.255 --> 00:03:59.801
Who you gonna kill next, Frank Casper?

55
00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.437
Who's your next mark?

56
00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:13.533
You are.

57
00:04:25.251 --> 00:04:28.978
Those that have witnessed execution
say there is no sound worse


58
00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:33.235
than the weeping of a mother
watching her son being put to death.


59
00:04:33.592 --> 00:04:36.706
They're wrong.
There is one sound that is worse.


60
00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:40.043
There is silence.

61
00:07:34.473 --> 00:07:36.985
I hear you have work for me.

62
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:40.522
I need a man killed.

63
00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:44.502
High profile. Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

64
00:07:47.403 --> 00:07:52.020
He is the number one cocaine distributor
in the entire North American continent.


65
00:07:52.124 --> 00:07:55.028
<i>He created the most efficient
and productive drug pipeline</i>


66
00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:57.625
<i>since the era of the cocaine cowboys.</i>

67
00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:02.803
<i>His pipeline ships over a thousand keys
a week of pure, uncut, Columbian cocaine,</i>


68
00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:06.348
<i>by way of Belize and Mexico.</i>

69
00:08:06.872 --> 00:08:10.128
<i>His U.S. distribution network
is the most intricate</i>


70
00:08:10.232 --> 00:08:15.075
<i>and sophisticated network ever created
in the history of the narcotics trade.</i>


71
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.915
<i>This all makes him the number one North
American resource for the Mexican cartels.</i>


72
00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:25.353
<i>So, I'm sure you can understand
why he's a very hard man to kill.</i>


73
00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:28.300
<i>But he needs to
be killed, at any cost.</i>

74
00:08:29.228 --> 00:08:31.707
I need the job done my way.

75
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:34.409
It sounds personal.

76
00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:36.895
Yeah, it's personal.

77
00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.207
My whole existence revolves
around the loss of his life.


78
00:08:41.707 --> 00:08:44.973
I need his assassination
to be heard all over America.


79
00:08:45.077 --> 00:08:47.889
And I want him six feet under.

80
00:08:48.313 --> 00:08:50.093
I don't do loud.

81
00:08:51.283 --> 00:08:55.864
- It has to be my way.
- I don't... do loud.


82
00:08:56.422 --> 00:08:58.064
Do you do two million dollars?

83
00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:04.373
A million now, and a million
when the job's complete.


84
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.900
Before you kill him,
I want you to shake him to the core.


85
00:09:12.004 --> 00:09:14.449
Just like he did to me.

86
00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:17.691
Make sure that he feels
everything I felt.


87
00:09:19.078 --> 00:09:22.911
<i>First, he has a team of psychos
he hand-picked for his protection.</i>


88
00:09:23.015 --> 00:09:25.381
<i>These are the closest members
of his entourage.</i>


89
00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:28.083
<i>They act on impulse and fear nothing.</i>

90
00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:33.141
<i>They're exclusive imports sent to him
from Mexico by top cartel leaders</i>


91
00:09:33.245 --> 00:09:39.159
<i>to ensure safety of their primary interest,
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.</i>


92
00:09:39.264 --> 00:09:43.232
<i>Sundown trusts them with his life,
and he has no reason not to.</i>


93
00:09:43.337 --> 00:09:45.359
<i>But I want to change that.</i>

94
00:09:45.464 --> 00:09:49.103
<i>I need you to reduce 'em
to nothing in front of him.</i>


95
00:09:49.207 --> 00:09:50.906
<i>Make him feel vulnerable.</i>

96
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.230
<i>Make him feel the deepest of fears,
knowing his turn is coming.</i>


97
00:09:56.582 --> 00:09:58.617
He carries a gun, at all times.

98
00:09:59.117 --> 00:10:01.670
It's very personal to him.
I gave him this gun.


99
00:11:01.613 --> 00:11:04.431
<i>I want you to
kill him with this gun.</i>

100
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.132
It's the gun he killed me with.

101
00:11:06.752 --> 00:11:09.036
But you're alive.

102
00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:12.020
A man of your experience,

103
00:11:12.124 --> 00:11:14.809
I'm sure you know there's more
than one way to kill a man.


104
00:11:16.828 --> 00:11:19.295
There's a million dollars in the trunk.

105
00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:22.666
Pick it up, walk
away, and the job's on.

106
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.799
Hey, you need to come down really quick.
Charlie just got killed really good, man.


107
00:18:49.514 --> 00:18:51.831
How much do you want?

108
00:18:52.617 --> 00:18:55.432
I've got a lot of fucking money.

109
00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:03.082
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll triple it.


110
00:19:04.362 --> 00:19:06.920
Kill the man who sent you to me.

111
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.231
I did what you asked.
Where's my balance?


112
00:21:52.832 --> 00:21:54.509
I have another job for you.

113
00:21:54.614 --> 00:21:57.999
What the fuck do I look like to you, man?
You owe me four grand.


114
00:21:58.104 --> 00:22:00.501
You pay me and I'm out of here.

115
00:22:00.605 --> 00:22:02.477
It's in the glove box.

116
00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:16.519
What other job?

117
00:22:17.622 --> 00:22:21.256
- I want you to kidnap someone for me.
- Fucking kidnapping?


118
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.609
Are you out of your fucking mind, man?
That's three strikes for me.


119
00:22:24.714 --> 00:22:26.737
That's 20 to life.

120
00:22:26.842 --> 00:22:31.452
I fucked up the guy who was messing
with your wife, that's as far as I go.


121
00:22:31.556 --> 00:22:33.500
I don't even have a wife.

122
00:22:33.605 --> 00:22:36.938
Your girlfriend, then.
Whoever, like I give a fuck.


123
00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:41.027
This just bought your buddy
a one-way trip to the hospital.


124
00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:43.430
And I didn't even know the guy.

125
00:22:49.287 --> 00:22:51.752
Well, so what...

126
00:22:51.856 --> 00:22:56.211
You just paid me all this money to kick
some guy's ass, that you don't even know?


127
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:59.494
Why?

128
00:22:59.598 --> 00:23:01.496
See if you had the balls
for the next job.


129
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.696
Whatever, man.

130
00:23:05.603 --> 00:23:07.801
Kidnap who?

131
00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:09.841
Sonny Garcia's wife.

132
00:23:11.998 --> 00:23:13.693
What?

133
00:23:14.446 --> 00:23:16.752
You got some kinda deathwish, pal?

134
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.216
Payback, pure and simple.

135
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.889
Then why don't you just go after him?
Why kidnap the guy's wife?


136
00:23:25.289 --> 00:23:27.321
Oh, I will.

137
00:23:27.425 --> 00:23:31.557
But first of all, I want him to suffer.
To suffer as I did.


138
00:23:31.662 --> 00:23:34.248
Then I will take his life.

139
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.699
You see, I'm not like the other bosses.

140
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.710
I don't take business personal.

141
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.466
Being a thief myself,
I know there's no honor among thieves.


142
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.981
So when you killed
my men for my drugs,

143
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.221
I know it was just business.

144
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:12.028
It was their fault for letting
you take the drugs from them.


145
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.105
If you hadn't killed them,
I would've killed them.


146
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.459
I too have killed many for
this very same white powder.


147
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.866
Your unfortunate mistake

148
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.826
is that one of the men you killed

149
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.946
happened to be  Son-in
-Law.

150
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.265
So... it's no longer business.

151
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.389
It's personal.

152
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.186
And that is a different matter.

153
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.862
I love my daughter

154
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.661
and you have broken her heart.

155
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.666
But I see something in
you so I am being merciful.


156
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:26.067
I am giving you a choice

157
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.101
and an opportunity.

158
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.468
A life for a life,

159
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.907
or a love for a love.

160
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.984
Your choice.

161
00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.306
Welcome to the family.

162
00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.942
I can see that you'll go
very far in this business.


163
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:26.646
That's a real cute story.

164
00:27:27.932 --> 00:27:29.472
How much are we talking?

165
00:27:33.171 --> 00:27:34.448
20 grand.

166
00:27:38.442 --> 00:27:39.584
I want 40.

167
00:27:41.712 --> 00:27:45.446
I'll go outside and I'll pick someone from
the line. They're queuing up for the job.


168
00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.734
All right, fine, fine. We'll do 20.

169
00:27:49.154 --> 00:27:52.937
I don't know how I'm gonna do it yet,
so, you gotta give me some time.


170
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:55.307
<i>I've got it all set up for you.</i>

171
00:27:55.726 --> 00:28:00.528
<i>She goes to the spa every Tuesday
at 3 p.m. sharp, and she never fails.</i>


172
00:28:00.632 --> 00:28:03.130
<i>Just herself, no driver.</i>

173
00:28:03.234 --> 00:28:05.799
<i>It's the only time
you will find her out without him.</i>


174
00:28:05.904 --> 00:28:07.665
<i>Now, things can change.</i>

175
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:11.292
<i>So I need you to keep watch
on the routine before you strike.</i>


176
00:28:11.397 --> 00:28:14.795
<i>I tell you this because failure
is not an option on this job.</i>


177
00:28:17.098 --> 00:28:19.163
<i>Sundown is usually not there.</i>

178
00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:22.785
<i>But if one thing changes,
it could cost you dearly.</i>


179
00:28:34.765 --> 00:28:38.566
<i>Don't make a move unless everything
is as it should be.</i>


180
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:43.611
<i>Sundown is no man to play with,
especially when it comes to his family.</i>


181
00:28:53.317 --> 00:28:55.568
Let me ask you a question.

182
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.837
This guy... kills your girl.

183
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:02.610
Why are you only kidnapping his wife?

184
00:29:02.861 --> 00:29:07.981
Why would you fuck up a 20 grand job
with all these questions?


185
00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:12.820
- Now, I'll be in touch.
- Okay.


186
00:29:15.206 --> 00:29:17.056
All right.

187
00:30:32.716 --> 00:30:34.960
<i>18 seconds.</i>

188
00:31:08.869 --> 00:31:11.527
Hey, I need backup.
Wilshire and Graham. I'm going in.


189
00:31:19.431 --> 00:31:22.045
DEA, drop the gun! Drop the gun!

190
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:24.517
Drop your gun! Drop your gun!
Drop your gu...


191
00:31:35.057 --> 00:31:38.076
- Drop your gun!
- Oh, fuck.


192
00:31:38.181 --> 00:31:40.948
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your goddamn hands up!


193
00:31:41.052 --> 00:31:42.375
Fuck you!

194
00:32:27.998 --> 00:32:31.085
Fuck! Fuck me.

195
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.820
Fuck.

196
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:44.129
Fuck!

197
00:32:47.217 --> 00:32:49.035
<i>Señora...</i>

198
00:32:58.697 --> 00:33:02.263
It's little hiccup.
Let's delay the operation.


199
00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:05.878
<i>You mean the operation that's currently
taking place in the hospital?</i>


200
00:33:06.337 --> 00:33:09.803
- <i>Are you a surgeon, now?</i>
- The fuck are you talking about?


201
00:33:09.908 --> 00:33:14.107
<i>You shot her. I told you
to kidnap her, not shoot her.</i>


202
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:15.809
<i>Now she's in intensive care.</i>

203
00:33:15.914 --> 00:33:20.017
<i>I gave you specific instructions,
which you did not follow.</i>


204
00:33:20.317 --> 00:33:25.184
All I wanna know from you...
is when and where do I get my money?


205
00:33:25.289 --> 00:33:26.888
<i>Good question.</i>

206
00:33:26.993 --> 00:33:30.090
<i>Now, my question to you is
who's gonna get to you first?</i>


207
00:33:30.195 --> 00:33:33.479
<i>Me, or Sonny Garcia?</i>

208
00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:01.233
This shouldn't have happened, Steph.

209
00:34:06.296 --> 00:34:09.314
I shouldn't have gotten you
into this life.


210
00:34:17.142 --> 00:34:20.893
It's over now. 
There's no more pain.

211
00:34:22.514 --> 00:34:25.233
It'll be over for me as soon.

212
00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:30.294
But first I have
to take care of something.


213
00:34:45.487 --> 00:34:47.975
I'll see you on the other side.

214
00:34:56.213 --> 00:34:58.297
I love you.

215
00:35:38.288 --> 00:35:40.553
How's the club business going?

216
00:35:41.992 --> 00:35:44.269
How's the pharmaceutical business going?

217
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.562
Got five hundred coming in next week.
Can you take it?


218
00:35:48.666 --> 00:35:50.283
No.

219
00:35:51.034 --> 00:35:54.053
That's cool, I'll split it..

220
00:35:54.605 --> 00:35:56.108
It's still a no.

221
00:35:58.143 --> 00:36:00.359
Let's cut to the chase.

222
00:36:01.044 --> 00:36:04.094
He sent me here
to give you a message.

223
00:36:04.199 --> 00:36:06.279
Boss down south?

224
00:36:06.383 --> 00:36:08.601
Not very pleased with you.

225
00:36:09.353 --> 00:36:12.109
Wants to know why
you haven't handled that situation?


226
00:36:13.158 --> 00:36:15.396
He also wants to know...

227
00:36:15.501 --> 00:36:17.581
why you're not taking his calls, Sonny.

228
00:36:17.685 --> 00:36:20.045
Well, first of all...

229
00:36:20.464 --> 00:36:23.460
tell him I'm not taking his calls because
I've already told him what my decision is.


230
00:36:23.564 --> 00:36:25.485
It's not gonna happen.

231
00:36:26.203 --> 00:36:28.468
He wants a war,

232
00:36:28.572 --> 00:36:32.625
he might as well bring it on, 'cause
I'm already preparing to bring it to him.


233
00:36:35.245 --> 00:36:37.729
You give him my message.

234
00:36:38.248 --> 00:36:41.884
Loud and clear, because I don't think
he understood me the first time.


235
00:36:46.356 --> 00:36:50.572
Secondly, don't you ever refer to me as
Sonny again, or I'll put two in your head.


236
00:36:55.933 --> 00:36:58.141
Get the fuck out of my house.

237
00:37:03.107 --> 00:37:05.024
He's giving you one week.

238
00:37:05.776 --> 00:37:07.825
One week,

239
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:10.176
or he handles it himself.

240
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.832
The choice is yours.

241
00:37:11.982 --> 00:37:14.128
My decision's been made.

242
00:37:34.271 --> 00:37:36.003
<i>Señora.</i>

243
00:38:20.117 --> 00:38:22.835
That didn't seem pretty friendly.

244
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.557
And you are?

245
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.588
I'm sorry. I'm Sénia, and you?

246
00:38:28.692 --> 00:38:32.544
You always make it a point
to snoop on other peoples' business?


247
00:38:35.532 --> 00:38:38.066
I wouldn't call it snooping.

248
00:38:41.071 --> 00:38:44.688
Some things just naturally
draw our attention.


249
00:38:47.511 --> 00:38:49.938
And so do some people.

250
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:00.656
Is that your wife?

251
00:39:07.131 --> 00:39:09.168
Beautiful woman.

252
00:39:11.168 --> 00:39:13.312
Who are you with?

253
00:39:13.629 --> 00:39:16.384
No one. Just me.

254
00:39:18.308 --> 00:39:20.592
Then how did you get in?

255
00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:25.487
A woman can achieve
anything she desires.


256
00:39:26.083 --> 00:39:28.581
Not everything is attainable.

257
00:39:28.685 --> 00:39:30.769
Maybe for some.

258
00:39:31.755 --> 00:39:35.365
This woman can get everything she wants.

259
00:40:13.097 --> 00:40:15.897
Fucking do not even play.

260
00:40:16.527 --> 00:40:18.686
What the fuck?

261
00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:23.188
I'm so sorry. I'll clean it up.

262
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.110
I'm sorry.

263
00:40:25.409 --> 00:40:27.774
Is this Yves Saint Laurent?

264
00:40:27.878 --> 00:40:31.164
I love a handsome man with good taste.

265
00:40:34.322 --> 00:40:39.953
I'm sorry. I shouldn't speak my mind
in front of your girlfriend?


266
00:40:40.057 --> 00:40:42.656
Some things are better left unsaid?

267
00:40:42.761 --> 00:40:44.544
Girlfriend?

268
00:40:44.863 --> 00:40:48.035
Oh, no, no, I barely know this bitch.

269
00:40:48.832 --> 00:40:51.050
Fucking asshole.

270
00:40:54.171 --> 00:40:57.905
- May I buy you a drink?
- Oh, I think you may.


271
00:40:58.009 --> 00:41:01.302
- Well, what's your weapon of choice?
- What?


272
00:41:01.678 --> 00:41:04.559
Sorry, I guess that's an American thing.

273
00:41:04.664 --> 00:41:07.549
What kind of drink do you like?

274
00:41:08.553 --> 00:41:10.670
I'm sorry.

275
00:41:10.988 --> 00:41:14.406
I'm having whatever you're having.

276
00:41:15.025 --> 00:41:17.424
- Is that okay?
- That's a good choice, baby.


277
00:41:17.529 --> 00:41:21.299
Oh, baby again. 
I love you Americans.

278
00:41:21.499 --> 00:41:24.418
- One more.
- Thank you.


279
00:41:25.401 --> 00:41:30.236
I need to go to the restroom.
You're not going to leave me, are you?


280
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.091
No.

281
00:41:37.916 --> 00:41:40.614
Nice piece of ass right there, bro.
You're the fucking man.


282
00:41:40.719 --> 00:41:43.101
Damn right, I'm the fucking man.

283
00:41:43.954 --> 00:41:46.481
That'll be 30 bucks, fellas.

284
00:41:51.895 --> 00:41:54.261
- My fucking wallet, dude.
- Dude, you just had it.


285
00:41:54.365 --> 00:41:56.468
I know I just
had it, it's fucking gone.

286
00:41:56.955 --> 00:42:00.704
- The fucking Russian bitch stole your wallet.
- No fucking way, dude.


287
00:42:01.304 --> 00:42:04.113
Pretty fucking bitch took my wallet.

288
00:42:28.867 --> 00:42:31.783
Nice job on the quick turnaround.

289
00:42:32.603 --> 00:42:34.887
You got it, baby.

290
00:42:35.606 --> 00:42:39.305
I've got a Asian customer
been dying for this one.


291
00:42:39.409 --> 00:42:42.427
He's a cheap motherfucker, though.

292
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.614
Relax.

293
00:42:44.718 --> 00:42:47.098
I always take care of you,

294
00:42:47.203 --> 00:42:48.976
don't I?

295
00:42:50.754 --> 00:42:53.251
Somebody left this for you.

296
00:42:53.356 --> 00:42:56.888
- Who gave this to you?
- Some kid dropped it off.


297
00:42:56.993 --> 00:43:01.259
By the way,
this ain't a fucking post office.


298
00:43:01.364 --> 00:43:05.302
I don't know you,
and you don't know me.

299
00:43:05.602 --> 00:43:07.419
Get it?

300
00:43:57.654 --> 00:44:01.459
Hello, Olivia.
Get in, let's have a chat.


301
00:44:02.459 --> 00:44:05.197
Who are you? How do you know me?

302
00:44:06.196 --> 00:44:10.997
I got a score for you.
Get in, and I'll give you the details.


303
00:44:11.101 --> 00:44:12.882
How do you know I'm not wired?

304
00:44:13.803 --> 00:44:17.924
Because a million dollar score
is worth more than a wire to a cop.


305
00:44:18.975 --> 00:44:21.027
Now, you get in, or I fuck off.

306
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.979
I've never heard of a no-split deal.

307
00:44:40.631 --> 00:44:42.648
What's your game?

308
00:44:43.733 --> 00:44:47.133
I get what I want,
you get what you want.


309
00:44:47.237 --> 00:44:49.235
What is that you want?

310
00:44:49.339 --> 00:44:53.406
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.
You ever heard of him?


311
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.179
Nope.

312
00:44:55.478 --> 00:44:58.778
Well, he's got something
that should've been mine.


313
00:44:58.882 --> 00:45:01.299
I want you to get it for me.

314
00:45:01.418 --> 00:45:03.583
What's the score?

315
00:45:03.687 --> 00:45:05.737
A necklace.

316
00:45:07.157 --> 00:45:09.126
The million dollar necklace?

317
00:45:09.827 --> 00:45:11.577
Yeah.

318
00:45:12.162 --> 00:45:15.054
How much is worth a man's freedom.

319
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:39.189
I can see you will
go far in this business.

320
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:44.544
No price can be
put on a man's freedom.

321
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.789
This necklace

322
00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.184
is worth one million dollars.

323
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:09.582
It will be worth every cent
when your freedom is on the line.


324
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:19.950
<i>Vámanos.</i>

325
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.385
Let's go.

326
00:46:40.083 --> 00:46:41.498
<i>It means the world to him.</i>

327
00:46:42.252 --> 00:46:43.754
I need you to rid him of it.

328
00:46:44.054 --> 00:46:45.637
So...

329
00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:51.710
just to make sure, you want me to take
that necklace and walk away?


330
00:46:52.162 --> 00:46:54.112
No split.

331
00:46:54.431 --> 00:46:57.196
- No split.
- Why?


332
00:46:57.301 --> 00:47:00.289
Because he bought that chain in blood.

333
00:47:06.276 --> 00:47:08.715
<i>The bosses have a
lot of pull in Mexico.</i>

334
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.878
<i>It was too easy for them
to pin her murder on me.</i>


335
00:47:11.982 --> 00:47:15.467
<i>One phone call, and a small payoff
to some corrupt cops.</i>


336
00:47:21.959 --> 00:47:24.177
<i>Call it a day.</i>

337
00:47:27.231 --> 00:47:32.684
<i>For his so-called loyalty, the boss ensured
that I got the worst treatment imaginable.</i>


338
00:47:37.741 --> 00:47:41.640
<i>Twenty years, twenty hard years
those motherfuckers gave me</i>


339
00:47:41.744 --> 00:47:43.810
<i>for a crime I did not commit.</i>

340
00:47:43.914 --> 00:47:48.934
<i>And worst of all, for murdering the woman
I would've given my life for.</i>


341
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.618
<i>Those are wounds that will never heal.</i>

342
00:47:51.722 --> 00:47:56.535
<i>All for a chain
and the fucking bullshit it represents.</i>


343
00:47:56.639 --> 00:48:01.794
<i>That chain is meant to buy him
his freedom if the need ever arises.</i>


344
00:48:01.899 --> 00:48:02.929
<i>And it cost me mine.</i>

345
00:48:03.033 --> 00:48:07.886
<i>Before I have him killed, I need you
to take that chain away from him.</i>


346
00:48:08.938 --> 00:48:11.713
<i>$500,000 if I split it.</i>

347
00:48:13.843 --> 00:48:15.775
Consider it done.

348
00:48:15.879 --> 00:48:18.682
- I said a million.
- Black market.


349
00:48:19.082 --> 00:48:21.118
Smart girl.

350
00:48:21.418 --> 00:48:24.238
There is one more thing you should know.

351
00:48:24.988 --> 00:48:27.908
He's got a soft spot for pretty girls.

352
00:48:31.227 --> 00:48:33.545
That's why you picked me.

353
00:49:17.574 --> 00:49:19.784
Who sent you?

354
00:49:22.712 --> 00:49:24.329
What do you mean?

355
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.975
I haven't been this lucky
in a long time.


356
00:49:43.767 --> 00:49:46.700
Oh, fuck.

357
00:49:49.238 --> 00:49:50.857
Yeah?

358
00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.175
I'll be right there.

359
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.478
I gotta go. Gotta work.

360
00:49:58.582 --> 00:50:02.816
Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
Five more minutes.

361
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:06.005
I'll make it worth your while.

362
00:50:15.131 --> 00:50:17.182
I wish I could.

363
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:23.014
I gotta go.

364
00:50:31.448 --> 00:50:33.665
I'll be in touch.

365
00:50:57.875 --> 00:51:01.828
Holy crap, man.
You scared the shit out of me.


366
00:51:03.313 --> 00:51:06.049
- Did you find her?
- Jeez, man.


367
00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:09.067
Don't creep up on people like that.

368
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.085
Yes, I found her. 
It's not good news.

369
00:51:13.189 --> 00:51:16.074
What do you mean, "it's not good news"?
Is she dead?


370
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.522
Far from it.

371
00:51:19.627 --> 00:51:22.729
This is her in Monaco
outside the Ritz-Carlton.


372
00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:26.245
A few days later in Paris
shopping at the Champs-Élysées.


373
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:30.268
A week later in Berlin,
a few days later in Thailand.


374
00:51:30.373 --> 00:51:32.171
Yeah, I think you get the point.

375
00:51:32.276 --> 00:51:35.393
Looks like she's globe-trotting
when you were gone.


376
00:51:36.613 --> 00:51:38.877
Gonna be a hard one to catch.

377
00:51:38.981 --> 00:51:42.034
And more importantly,
expensive to catch.


378
00:51:46.389 --> 00:51:48.406
I'll be in touch.

379
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.977
Hey, where's my money?

380
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:57.301
I asked you to find her, not give me
her goddamn travel itinerary.


381
00:51:57.901 --> 00:52:00.084
When your people find her,

382
00:52:00.503 --> 00:52:04.437
and bring her to me,
then you get your money.


383
00:52:11.247 --> 00:52:15.267
- These things cost money, Sundown.
- Figure it out.


384
00:53:56.118 --> 00:53:57.183
<i>Where are the cars?</i>

385
00:53:57.287 --> 00:54:00.286
<i>I told you already, brother,
one more week, it's not easy.</i>


386
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:05.258
<i>One I 70 T, one 7-series, one Escalade,
delivered in Dubai Wednesday?</i>


387
00:54:05.362 --> 00:54:07.927
<i>I'm trying, brother.
I told the guy, already.</i>


388
00:54:08.031 --> 00:54:11.365
- <i>What day is today?</i>
- <i>Monday.</i>


389
00:54:11.469 --> 00:54:13.902
<i>Then how will you tell me
one week early, now?</i>


390
00:54:14.006 --> 00:54:16.333
<i>How will you tell me one way
we can both survive?</i>


391
00:54:16.438 --> 00:54:17.837
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>No?</i>


392
00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:22.593
<i>So how will these cars will get to Dubai
by Wednesday, Khaled, how?</i>


393
00:54:24.748 --> 00:54:27.365
<i>Hold on, hold on. 
There's an echo.</i>

394
00:54:28.284 --> 00:54:32.383
<i>Oh, it's our bounty hunter,
the private investigator.</i>


395
00:54:32.487 --> 00:54:34.333
<i>Really?</i>

396
00:54:36.459 --> 00:54:41.194
- <i>Hey, you need better equipment.</i>
- <i>Mister Finley, Mister investigator?</i>


397
00:54:41.298 --> 00:54:45.164
<i>I was asked to give you a message.

398
00:54:45.269 --> 00:54:47.251
<i>Better be on time.</i>

399
00:54:48.939 --> 00:54:51.304
- <i>You hang up first.</i>
- <i>No, no, you hang up first.</i>


400
00:54:51.408 --> 00:54:54.331
<i>No, no, no, you hang up first.</i>

401
00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.326
How'd you find me?

402
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.687
I heard about your speciality.

403
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:11.075
What do you want, man?

404
00:55:11.594 --> 00:55:14.512
Have you heard of Sonny
"Sundown" Garcia?


405
00:55:16.699 --> 00:55:18.296
Yeah.

406
00:55:18.401 --> 00:55:20.232
Everybody has.

407
00:55:20.336 --> 00:55:22.735
I need you to get
some information for me.


408
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.658
- Oh, for the right price?
- Price is not an issue.


409
00:55:27.076 --> 00:55:30.777
Well, keep in mind tracking Sundown
is no easy task. He's a smart man.


410
00:55:30.881 --> 00:55:33.365
- You won't be tracking down Sundown.
- Then, who?


411
00:55:34.984 --> 00:55:36.576
His wife.

412
00:55:39.889 --> 00:55:41.944
He's the head of an organization.

413
00:55:42.048 --> 00:55:45.490
Your superiors expect you
to keep your house in order.


414
00:55:45.595 --> 00:55:48.727
His wife has been slipping
through the grass like a snake.


415
00:55:48.831 --> 00:55:50.346
I need her exposed.

416
00:55:50.451 --> 00:55:53.167
Safe to assume
you're one of those superiors?


417
00:55:53.603 --> 00:55:55.435
- No.
- DEA?


418
00:55:55.539 --> 00:55:56.973
Absolutely not.

419
00:55:57.673 --> 00:56:02.001
Then why on Earth would you involve yourself
with a man as dangerous as Sundown?


420
00:56:02.979 --> 00:56:05.363
'Cause I've got a score to settle.

421
00:56:11.254 --> 00:56:13.718
<i>My father was in the business.</i>

422
00:56:13.822 --> 00:56:16.613
<i>He was down in Mexico on a deal,
and the junkie he was</i>


423
00:56:16.717 --> 00:56:18.958
<i>thought it would be a good idea
to take me along,</i>


424
00:56:19.062 --> 00:56:21.294
<i>'cause he couldn't find a babysitter.</i>

425
00:56:21.398 --> 00:56:25.298
<i>A quick pop across the border to Juárez
for a few pounds of weed.</i>


426
00:56:25.402 --> 00:56:27.586
<i>No big deal, right?</i>

427
00:56:44.086 --> 00:56:46.199
<i>What he didn't factor in
was the ruthlessness</i>


428
00:56:46.303 --> 00:56:49.062
<i>of some of the people
he did business with.</i>


429
00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.585
<i>I was kidnapped for ransom.</i>

430
00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.086
<i>They thought he had money, but unfortunately
he didn't have anything close,</i>


431
00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:10.079
<i>so they couldn't buy me back.</i>

432
00:57:10.479 --> 00:57:14.517
<i>Unable to show any weakness, the kidnappers
made him believe they killed me.</i>


433
00:57:14.621 --> 00:57:17.470
<i>He was devastated
and returned to America.</i>


434
00:57:17.574 --> 00:57:20.090
<i>But these kidnappers
truly meant no harm, though.</i>


435
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:23.538
<i>They just needed to put food
on the table.</i>


436
00:57:23.643 --> 00:57:26.541
<i>Having no more need for me,
and no desire to kill me,</i>


437
00:57:26.646 --> 00:57:30.665
<i>they threw me on the streets of Juárez
to fend for myself.</i>


438
00:57:31.033 --> 00:57:36.246
<i>Being a stranded 10-year old gringo
on the streets of Juárez is no easy task.</i>


439
00:57:47.517 --> 00:57:49.734
<i>And that's when I met her.</i>

440
00:57:51.287 --> 00:57:53.752
<i>Her name was Sophia.</i>

441
00:57:53.856 --> 00:57:58.476
<i>I fell in love with her at that
very moment, and she with me.</i>


442
00:58:07.537 --> 00:58:10.821
<i>They took care of me
and raised me like their own.</i>


443
00:58:18.831 --> 00:58:21.648
<i>I made them the promise that
I would love and protect their daughter</i>


444
00:58:21.752 --> 00:58:23.311
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

445
00:58:32.494 --> 00:58:37.686
<i>Years later, she was as beautiful
as the first time I laid eyes on her.</i>


446
00:58:38.784 --> 00:58:41.217
<i>Innocent and pure, with a heart of gold.</i>

447
00:58:51.714 --> 00:58:54.599
<i>We made plans to grow old together.</i>

448
00:58:56.285 --> 00:58:58.803
<i>Have a family of our own.</i>

449
00:59:01.357 --> 00:59:03.011
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

450
00:59:03.115 --> 00:59:06.152
<i>I met the wrong person along the way.</i>

451
00:59:11.133 --> 00:59:13.798
<i>His name was Sonny Garcia.</i>

452
00:59:13.902 --> 00:59:18.691
<i>He was a boy at the time.
The sunrise before the Sundown.</i>


453
00:59:19.426 --> 00:59:21.783
<i>A man's reputation is worth everything.</i>

454
00:59:26.048 --> 00:59:28.599
<i>He took that away from me.</i>

455
00:59:32.188 --> 00:59:35.291
<i>He was given a choice,
and made the world believe it was mine.</i>


456
00:59:35.791 --> 00:59:39.977
<i>Including those who raised me,
and opened their hearts to me.</i>


457
00:59:42.798 --> 00:59:44.749
And I'm gonna give him another.

458
00:59:45.934 --> 00:59:49.367
How is the intel I'm gonna gather
helping your revenge?


459
00:59:49.471 --> 00:59:52.324
Because it will go to those
who raised him.


460
00:59:53.042 --> 00:59:56.352
They'll give him a couple of choices,
and I think I know which one he'll take,


461
00:59:56.456 --> 00:59:58.949
- and that'll be his downfall.
- That's it?


462
00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.831
That's all you're gonna do to get revenge.
The guy killed your girlfriend, dude.


463
01:00:02.935 --> 01:00:05.020
He's powerful.

464
01:00:05.588 --> 01:00:09.855
I will kill him, but I want him
to suffer like I've suffered.


465
01:00:12.728 --> 01:00:14.843
<i>She's working with the DEA.</i>

466
01:00:14.947 --> 01:00:18.597
<i>With the case exposed,
Sundown is being extra cautious.</i>


467
01:00:18.701 --> 01:00:21.734
<i>Their only way to him now,
is through his wife.</i>


468
01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:24.984
<i>She knows everything,
and they've fooled her into thinking</i>


469
01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:28.524
<i>that she can serve up to life
behind bars for complicity.</i>


470
01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:32.745
<i>They're offering her immunity for further
information, as well as her testimony.</i>


471
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:35.781
<i>This will cost the Mexican bosses
a lot of revenue.</i>


472
01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:37.916
<i>I need to have her exposed.</i>

473
01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:43.112
<i>Only then will he be presented
with the choice I expect them to give him.</i>


474
01:00:44.526 --> 01:00:45.946
How much?

475
01:00:48.865 --> 01:00:50.959
Name your price.

476
01:01:33.142 --> 01:01:36.047
You're gonna get me fucking killed
with these meetings.


477
01:01:36.612 --> 01:01:38.978
You better have some kind of Witness
Protection Program to put me in.


478
01:01:39.082 --> 01:01:41.981
Do you even know who these people are?
What they're capable of?


479
01:01:42.085 --> 01:01:45.368
If anybody gets wind of this now,
I'm a gonner.


480
01:01:45.472 --> 01:01:48.673
You'll be fine.
It's not the first time we've done this.


481
01:01:50.193 --> 01:01:52.656
Now, you tell us what we want,

482
01:01:52.761 --> 01:01:55.710
<i>and you can put
this entire process behind you.</i>


483
01:01:55.814 --> 01:02:00.049
- Like promised, we'll take care of you.
- Damn fucking right, you'll take care of me.


484
01:02:00.154 --> 01:02:04.069
Don't get too cocky, Missus Garcia,
you need us more than we need you.


485
01:02:04.173 --> 01:02:08.125
Now, we're willing to work with you,
but you need to reciprocate.


486
01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:16.334
We need him red-handed.
Can you facilitate that?


487
01:02:17.587 --> 01:02:18.956
When is the next shipment?

488
01:02:19.555 --> 01:02:22.904
<i>How does he get the goods into
the country? Who does he talk to?</i>


489
01:02:23.009 --> 01:02:25.893
Just one fucking question
at a time, okay?


490
01:02:26.728 --> 01:02:28.412
Okay.

491
01:02:38.707 --> 01:02:42.144
He makes about two shipments a week.
Sometimes more.


492
01:02:42.645 --> 01:02:44.862
Never less than two.

493
01:02:45.381 --> 01:02:47.434
<i>It comes in through South America.</i>

494
01:02:48.417 --> 01:02:51.402
He facilitates it
through the Mexican border.


495
01:02:51.787 --> 01:02:53.818
Everyone's in on it.

496
01:02:53.922 --> 01:02:56.240
Everyone gets paid.

497
01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.692
It's basically foolproof.

498
01:03:00.796 --> 01:03:04.219
We already know all this, Mrs. Garcia.
We need to know how.


499
01:03:05.168 --> 01:03:09.290
Now, I can't offer you immunity
if you don't cooperate.


500
01:03:10.072 --> 01:03:15.059
So you tell us what we want, we'll give you
what you need. It is as simple as that.


501
01:03:22.851 --> 01:03:26.518
<i>Don't get too cocky, Mrs. Garcia,
you need us more than we need you.</i>


502
01:03:26.622 --> 01:03:29.922
<i>Now, we're willing to work with you,
but you need to reciprocate.</i>


503
01:03:30.092 --> 01:03:33.058
<i>We need him red-handed.
Can you facilitate that?</i>


504
01:03:33.162 --> 01:03:34.650
<i>When is the next shipment?</i>

505
01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:46.606
Yeah?

506
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.778
<i>He facilitates it
through the Mexican border.</i>


507
01:03:50.078 --> 01:03:51.897
<i>Everyone's in on it.</i>

508
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:55.380
I received some very troubling news today.

509
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:58.141
I've got something I want you to hear.

510
01:03:58.221 --> 01:04:01.486
<i>He makes about two shipments
a week, sometimes more.</i>


511
01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:03.455
<i>Never less than two.</i>

512
01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:09.847
<i>Everyone gets paid.
It's basically foolproof.</i>


513
01:04:12.935 --> 01:04:14.105
Who was that?

514
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:18.306
You know exactly who it is, Sundown.

515
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:22.304
But if you're confused,
I'll make it clear for you.


516
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.109
It's your wife.

517
01:04:31.521 --> 01:04:33.837
The fuck are you talking about?

518
01:04:34.156 --> 01:04:35.706
It could be anyone.

519
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:38.865
Technology is quite a thing, son.

520
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:42.625
We didn't have all these toys
when I started in this


521
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:47.828
We used to kill people
based on word of mouth.


522
01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.668
It's your wife.

523
01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:01.742
She's using very dangterous words.

524
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:05.028
She's going to stop everything,

525
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:08.302
including you.

526
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:13.706
I expect you to take care of her.

527
01:05:15.764 --> 01:05:17.982
Don't worry about it.

528
01:05:18.668 --> 01:05:19.865
I'll take care of it.

529
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.460
No, no, no, my son.

530
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.822
I don't think you heard me clearly.

531
01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:29.222
I didn't say take care of it.

532
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.508
I said take care of HER.

533
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:34.828
Understand?

534
01:05:36.685 --> 01:05:40.304
<i>Fuck you! You think you made me?</i>

535
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:42.888
You kill me, you lose everything.

536
01:05:42.992 --> 01:05:45.977
Nobody makes you money like I do,
you fucking pop-tart.


537
01:05:48.331 --> 01:05:51.214
<i>This is America, not Mexico, cabrón.</i>

538
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:54.508
Not everything is about money, son.

539
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:59.222
Honor and reputation go a
long way in this business.


540
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:03.060
I gave you a choice to make once,

541
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:07.821
and look how well the choice
you made worked in your favor.


542
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:17.822
Welcome to the family.

543
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:20.902
I'm giving you yet another choice.

544
01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:24.910
I hope you make the right decision again.

545
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:29.780
Her life by your hands

546
01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:33.228
or your life by my hands.

547
01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.988
<i>Señora.</i>

548
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:45.109
Remember?

549
01:07:08.945 --> 01:07:11.175
I hope she's not pregnant.

550
01:07:11.279 --> 01:07:14.375
Yeah. She's very fertile.

551
01:07:21.723 --> 01:07:26.243
- I gotta go, hey!
- You just fucking destroyed us, Steph.


552
01:07:26.795 --> 01:07:28.676
What do you mean?

553
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:32.731
You're talking to the DEA.
I beat the fucking case.


554
01:07:32.835 --> 01:07:36.635
And now you're throwing me back to
the wolves. You deceitful fucking bitch.


555
01:07:36.739 --> 01:07:38.738
I haven't been talking to anyone,
I don't know what...


556
01:07:38.842 --> 01:07:42.240
- They have it on fucking video, Steph.
- What video?


557
01:07:42.345 --> 01:07:47.331
Video, audio, pictures, you,
talking to the fucking narcs.


558
01:07:49.468 --> 01:07:51.671
Remember what you promised?

559
01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.839
What were you gonna
trade me in, for? Immunity?


560
01:07:57.259 --> 01:08:01.394
Do you fucking realize, that even if I did
go down it wouldn't bring you down with me.


561
01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:04.200
You already have
your fucking immunity. With me!


562
01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.100
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of this fucking life.


563
01:08:08.204 --> 01:08:11.368
I mean, what fucking immunity?
What does that even fucking mean?


564
01:08:11.473 --> 01:08:13.939
That I get to live in hiding
for the rest of my fucking life?


565
01:08:14.043 --> 01:08:17.696
I mean, Sonny, I'm just looking
for some fucking normalcy.


566
01:08:18.013 --> 01:08:20.678
Can't you fucking understand that?

567
01:08:20.782 --> 01:08:22.748
Do you realize the position
you've put me in now?


568
01:08:22.852 --> 01:08:25.984
I don't give a fuck, Sonny.
You put yourself in this position.


569
01:08:26.088 --> 01:08:30.622
You put me in this position. You don't
give a fucking flying shit about us.


570
01:08:30.726 --> 01:08:34.059
All this has ever been is about is about
you and your fucking drugs, Sonny.


571
01:08:34.163 --> 01:08:37.066
I mean, would I give you up
for immunity? For a fucking life?


572
01:08:37.667 --> 01:08:41.919
You would give me up for your fucking
drugs, Sonny, and you fucking know it.


573
01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:55.232
You're losing it, Sonny.

574
01:09:27.783 --> 01:09:29.804
Watch your head.

575
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.313
Would you like a glass of wine?

576
01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:46.965
I don't even drink wine,
but they say this one's one of the best.


577
01:09:47.069 --> 01:09:48.266
From France.

578
01:09:48.371 --> 01:09:51.569
- Chelsea?
- Yeah, sure, why not?


579
01:09:53.376 --> 01:09:55.607
<i>Why do you want to buy a boat?</i>

580
01:09:55.711 --> 01:09:58.514
<i>Like I say, I'm a guy. 
I like my toys.</i>

581
01:09:59.414 --> 01:10:01.583
Plus, the color matches
the Bugatti, right, babe?


582
01:10:02.618 --> 01:10:05.563
Bugatti. Impressive.

583
01:10:07.022 --> 01:10:09.373
So, what do you want for it?

584
01:10:11.592 --> 01:10:15.227
I'm not so sure. It's my grandfather's,
and he just passed.


585
01:10:15.331 --> 01:10:18.596
I flew in from Hong Kong
to manage his estate.


586
01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:23.035
I don't know what to do about this.
But... I did some research.


587
01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:26.832
This boat, it's apparently
worth over half million.


588
01:10:27.776 --> 01:10:30.558
I'll give you $200,000 for it.
Not a penny more.


589
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.128
200 K's too low.

590
01:10:34.232 --> 01:10:36.490
Some other buyer's willing to pay more.

591
01:10:38.019 --> 01:10:38.984
Where are they?

592
01:10:39.088 --> 01:10:42.002
They're waiting for financing
to come through.


593
01:10:42.758 --> 01:10:45.857
Let me save you the hassle, honey.
It's not gonna happen.


594
01:10:45.962 --> 01:10:48.513
No one is lending, not in this economy.

595
01:10:49.431 --> 01:10:53.198
I've got clients who can't meet payroll
on a 20 year mature business


596
01:10:53.302 --> 01:10:56.902
because JP Morgan would rather earn
four points on the Malaysian Ringgit.


597
01:10:57.006 --> 01:11:01.105
So, if you think anyone is lending
for a second-hand boat,


598
01:11:01.209 --> 01:11:03.413
then I got a Borneo gold mind outside.

599
01:11:03.913 --> 01:11:05.743
Cash is king, honey.

600
01:11:05.847 --> 01:11:07.367
He's in finance.

601
01:11:10.752 --> 01:11:12.574
Half million.

602
01:11:13.221 --> 01:11:16.359
Listen, I got a meeting in half an hour.
Let me make this simple for you.


603
01:11:16.759 --> 01:11:20.229
Follow me to the bank, I'll pull out

604
01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:24.988
I'll have the other hundred wired from
a bank in Lichtenstein in 18 hours. Deal?


605
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:43.534
- Hello?
- <i>I heard you have a boat for sale?</i>


606
01:11:45.288 --> 01:11:47.756
<i>Are you not the one selling the boat?</i>

607
01:11:48.156 --> 01:11:49.521
You must got the wrong person.

608
01:11:49.625 --> 01:11:53.091
<i>Well, that's weird, because I definitely
heard you was the one selling a boat.</i>


609
01:11:53.196 --> 01:11:57.495
<i>Matter of fact, I heard you've already
sold it five times this week, alone.</i>


610
01:11:57.599 --> 01:12:00.231
<i>When do the real owners get back?</i>

611
01:12:00.335 --> 01:12:03.102
- How did you get my number?
- <i>Don't worry, I'm not a fed.</i>


612
01:12:03.207 --> 01:12:06.638
- <i>But we need to talk.</i>
- Talk about what?


613
01:12:06.742 --> 01:12:10.227
<i>Talk about how you can make
millions in a week.</i>


614
01:12:51.086 --> 01:12:53.103
Take a seat.

615
01:12:59.928 --> 01:13:02.349
Don't you wanna close the door?

616
01:13:08.603 --> 01:13:12.389
I've been following your cons.
Pretty impressive.


617
01:13:13.141 --> 01:13:17.374
With the boat and everything?
But the one I like is the paintings.


618
01:13:17.479 --> 01:13:21.145
That's a real good one for me.
What gets me, is...


619
01:13:21.249 --> 01:13:24.448
how do you keep coming up
with all these different ideas?


620
01:13:24.553 --> 01:13:26.851
You said the millions in the week.

621
01:13:26.955 --> 01:13:28.853
What's the job?

622
01:13:28.957 --> 01:13:31.408
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

623
01:13:32.127 --> 01:13:35.579
He's worth a fortune,
and I wanna rid him of some of it.


624
01:13:36.398 --> 01:13:38.763
I wanna do a money laundering job.

625
01:13:38.867 --> 01:13:44.869
I'll bankroll it. Start him off small,
build him up to the big take.


626
01:13:44.973 --> 01:13:47.037
He's got a competitive edge.

627
01:13:47.142 --> 01:13:49.592
Once you get him where you want him...

628
01:13:50.345 --> 01:13:52.395
he's all in.

629
01:13:55.416 --> 01:13:57.448
What if he doesn't?

630
01:13:57.552 --> 01:14:00.351
If he doesn't, there's
two hundred grand in that bag.


631
01:14:00.455 --> 01:14:04.507
If the job don't come off,
we'll call it services rendered.


632
01:14:06.995 --> 01:14:11.569
What if I take the 200
and disappear right now?


633
01:14:13.134 --> 01:14:16.401
Well, that's easy. 
I found you once.

634
01:14:16.505 --> 01:14:21.442
If I have to find you a second time,
it'll really fucking irritate me.


635
01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:35.472
I'll let you know.

636
01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.167
You fucking do that.

637
01:15:21.202 --> 01:15:22.503
Rosco's here.

638
01:15:42.757 --> 01:15:45.442
Who the fuck gave you the okay?

639
01:15:45.894 --> 01:15:48.556
No one told me
this was a private party.

640
01:15:48.896 --> 01:15:51.833
Now you know.
Get the fuck out of my club.


641
01:15:52.633 --> 01:15:55.485
Be careful how you move, Sundown.

642
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:58.072
It could mean the end of you.

643
01:16:00.842 --> 01:16:02.806
And this?

644
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:05.186
Is on your tab, by the way.

645
01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:07.945
I don't hold tabs in my own club.

646
01:16:08.049 --> 01:16:10.281
I don't hold tabs anywhere.

647
01:16:10.385 --> 01:16:12.469
That's your kind of thing.

648
01:16:13.622 --> 01:16:15.490
Your mom is güey.

649
01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:18.241
Fuck off.

650
01:16:24.532 --> 01:16:26.815
What the fuck are you still doing here?

651
01:16:29.337 --> 01:16:32.120
I'm a lady, please be polite.

652
01:16:32.225 --> 01:16:35.111
I already paid for my drink.
I'm gonna finish it.


653
01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:37.835
You finish that drink,

654
01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.102
the whole tab is yours.

655
01:16:40.615 --> 01:16:41.829
How's that sound?

656
01:16:48.756 --> 01:16:51.059
Keep the change.

657
01:16:51.859 --> 01:16:54.125
Rosco's paying you well.

658
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:57.129
Did you ever think
that maybe I pay him well?


659
01:16:57.233 --> 01:17:00.098
You ever think that maybe I know
exactly what he makes?


660
01:17:00.203 --> 01:17:04.321
I'm sure you do. But do you know
how much money I clean for him?


661
01:17:05.574 --> 01:17:08.092
Everybody has their cleaners.

662
01:17:11.479 --> 01:17:13.098
Not like me.

663
01:17:15.533 --> 01:17:17.551
And what makes you so special?

664
01:17:20.288 --> 01:17:25.417
I can not tell you that.
I work for Rosco. Not you.


665
01:17:39.173 --> 01:17:41.424
Hundred grand, right?

666
01:17:43.979 --> 01:17:47.645
- What's the turnaround?
- 48 hours.


667
01:17:47.749 --> 01:17:49.447
The return?

668
01:17:49.551 --> 01:17:51.936
120 back to you.

669
01:17:52.787 --> 01:17:54.871
And to you?

670
01:17:55.423 --> 01:17:57.922
120 to you is all that matters.

671
01:17:58.026 --> 01:18:00.288
You're being paid to launder
your own money.


672
01:18:00.392 --> 01:18:02.760
What do you care what I make?

673
01:18:02.864 --> 01:18:04.748
Fair enough.

674
01:18:20.748 --> 01:18:23.198
120, like promised.

675
01:18:24.252 --> 01:18:25.816
Impressive.

676
01:18:25.921 --> 01:18:28.540
Here's 200,
let's see what you do with it.


677
01:18:47.009 --> 01:18:49.011
- Hello.
- <i>Where've you been?</i>


678
01:18:49.411 --> 01:18:51.338
I've got more product for you.

679
01:18:51.442 --> 01:18:54.433
- I've been busy.
- Busy with what?


680
01:18:55.584 --> 01:18:57.586
Bigger transactions.

681
01:18:58.185 --> 01:18:59.512
<i>How big?</i>

682
01:18:59.617 --> 01:19:04.088
Bigger than what I've been doing for you.
I've got to go, I'll call you back.


683
01:19:04.192 --> 01:19:07.729
<i>Wait, wait, hold on.
How much're we talking?</i>


684
01:19:08.129 --> 01:19:10.059
Wasn't that the whole point of this?

685
01:19:10.164 --> 01:19:13.268
Listen, I've got to make money.
I go where the money is.


686
01:19:13.568 --> 01:19:16.634
- <i>Plain and simple.</i>
- And where's the money?


687
01:19:16.738 --> 01:19:20.642
<i>I think you know that.
I have a bigger client.</i>


688
01:19:21.142 --> 01:19:23.494
Bigger than me?
What're you, fucking stupid?


689
01:19:24.912 --> 01:19:28.699
- I don't really care.
- How much are we talking?


690
01:19:30.852 --> 01:19:35.258
Five million minimum.
What is your term, now or never?


691
01:19:35.557 --> 01:19:39.276
Stop everything you're doing,
and I'll make it ten million dollars.


692
01:19:43.464 --> 01:19:45.416
Okay.

693
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:52.790
Where you all going? 
Sit the fuck down.

694
01:20:53.568 --> 01:20:55.916
Get her done, partner.

695
01:21:38.446 --> 01:21:39.956
Damn.

696
01:21:50.292 --> 01:21:53.245
I heard that you guys
got a lot of money hidden here.


697
01:21:53.844 --> 01:21:56.094
Are the rumors true?

698
01:21:56.531 --> 01:21:58.881
No, ain't no money up in here.

699
01:21:59.166 --> 01:22:01.352
No money?

700
01:22:03.404 --> 01:22:06.742
All the dope that y'all been
pushing up in this place, and there is...


701
01:22:07.742 --> 01:22:10.579
no money? Nada, zip?

702
01:22:10.778 --> 01:22:14.018
I didn't push nothing,
I don't know what you're talking about.


703
01:23:21.849 --> 01:23:23.733
The stove.

704
01:24:12.199 --> 01:24:14.866
- Who are you?
- I just wanna make you an offer.


705
01:24:14.971 --> 01:24:19.136
- Nothing to worry about.
- I worry about everything.


706
01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:22.726
I asked you a question. Who are you?

707
01:24:24.211 --> 01:24:26.569
My name's John Doe.

708
01:24:29.116 --> 01:24:31.467
All right, John Doe.

709
01:24:31.987 --> 01:24:35.852
How would you like a bullet to your face
before I get out of this car?


710
01:24:35.956 --> 01:24:39.722
Now, I know all about you.
That's why I've asked you for this meet.


711
01:24:39.827 --> 01:24:41.325
How'd you get in my car?

712
01:24:41.429 --> 01:24:43.903
Come on, you're a cop.
You know how that works.


713
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.156
So what's your offer?

714
01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:51.887
Put the gun down first.

715
01:24:53.207 --> 01:24:56.459
Put the gown down now,
I know your reputation.


716
01:25:04.852 --> 01:25:06.736
So let's hear about your offer.

717
01:25:08.222 --> 01:25:11.794
I got a job for you.
You can earn a shitload of money.


718
01:25:13.094 --> 01:25:16.548
Sounds like a two-way street.
What's in it for you?


719
01:25:17.598 --> 01:25:21.680
Why does everybody ask
what's in it for me? Why is that?


720
01:25:22.571 --> 01:25:25.955
'Cause there always is. Something.

721
01:25:29.744 --> 01:25:31.742
Revenge.

722
01:25:31.846 --> 01:25:35.798
That's what's in it for me.
Fucking revenge.


723
01:25:39.787 --> 01:25:43.559
<i>I want to take everything away
from this man I seek revenge from,</i>


724
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.156
<i>including his life.</i>

725
01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:50.058
<i>But before I do that,
I want to take away his freedom.</i>


726
01:25:50.599 --> 01:25:53.230
<i>I did 20 years
in there because of him.</i>

727
01:25:53.335 --> 01:25:57.801
<i>The only thing that kept me alive
was the thirst for revenge.</i>


728
01:25:57.905 --> 01:26:01.090
<i>He needs to feel everything that I felt.</i>

729
01:26:04.862 --> 01:26:06.598
<i>We used to run the streets together.</i>

730
01:26:06.798 --> 01:26:09.849
<i>We came up from nothing,
and were going places.</i>


731
01:26:21.263 --> 01:26:25.943
<i>I was there for him through thick
and thin, and so was he for me.</i>


732
01:26:35.542 --> 01:26:38.324
<i>But there was always something
different about him.</i>


733
01:26:38.429 --> 01:26:42.967
<i>I couldn't put my finger on it at the time,
but I should've seen it coming.</i>


734
01:26:45.586 --> 01:26:49.138
<i>When I truly realized, it was too late.</i>

735
01:26:52.092 --> 01:26:54.761
<i>I guess love defeats reason.</i>

736
01:26:56.231 --> 01:26:58.261
And he took it all.

737
01:26:58.365 --> 01:27:01.332
My love, my life, my money.

738
01:27:01.436 --> 01:27:06.079
And ultimately my freedom.
Now his time has come.


739
01:27:09.009 --> 01:27:11.871
Who is this mystical man you speak of?

740
01:27:14.248 --> 01:27:18.129
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

741
01:27:20.304 --> 01:27:24.271
Do you have any idea how long
they been trying to get this guy?


742
01:27:24.376 --> 01:27:26.089
Not likely.

743
01:27:26.193 --> 01:27:28.558
You don't know him like I know him.

744
01:27:28.662 --> 01:27:31.394
I can serve him up
on a plate to you.

745
01:27:31.498 --> 01:27:34.499
You'll get that promotion
you've always been after.


746
01:27:34.852 --> 01:27:37.267
That's where you've got me pegged wrong.

747
01:27:37.371 --> 01:27:40.524
I am very happy where I'm at.

748
01:27:40.628 --> 01:27:44.360
So you can have Sundown to yourself.

749
01:27:45.045 --> 01:27:47.081
Okay, cool.

750
01:27:47.381 --> 01:27:50.673
Maybe I'll take that million dollars
that's there, as well.


751
01:27:53.921 --> 01:27:56.420
Nobody knows it's there.

752
01:27:56.791 --> 01:27:58.591
Walk in,

753
01:27:59.314 --> 01:28:01.162
pick it up,

754
01:28:01.267 --> 01:28:04.836
straight out the front door.
No questions asked.


755
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.984
A million dollars?

756
01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:12.700
Tax fucking free.

757
01:28:16.533 --> 01:28:18.358
Shit.

758
01:28:27.621 --> 01:28:31.076
<i>He gets shipments twice a week.
Saturday nights in particular.</i>


759
01:28:31.626 --> 01:28:34.725
<i>The cops are too busy
with everything else to be bothered.</i>


760
01:28:34.829 --> 01:28:38.949
<i>It looks like regular liquor deliveries
to a club, so no one thinks anything of it.</i>


761
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:51.674
<i>The safe is right behind
the painting in his office.</i>


762
01:28:51.779 --> 01:28:56.165
<i>No one knows it's even there.
Not even his closest men.</i>


763
01:28:57.084 --> 01:29:00.651
<i>His guard is lower than it will be
after I really start on him,</i>


764
01:29:00.755 --> 01:29:03.520
<i>so now's the right time
for you to strike.</i>


765
01:29:03.624 --> 01:29:07.806
<i>In a few weeks, I can assure you
things will be very different for him.</i>


766
01:29:08.429 --> 01:29:10.393
Nobody fucking move!

767
01:29:10.497 --> 01:29:12.829
All of you, on your knees.

768
01:29:12.933 --> 01:29:14.331
Now!

769
01:29:14.436 --> 01:29:17.233
On your fucking knees,
or the next one's to your head.


770
01:29:17.338 --> 01:29:19.103
On your fucking knees!

771
01:29:19.207 --> 01:29:22.660
Not even when I proposed to my wife
did I get on my knees, cocksucker.


772
01:29:25.913 --> 01:29:29.065
Don't you fucking dare,
or you'll take two to the head.


773
01:29:41.362 --> 01:29:43.314
Well, well, well, boys.

774
01:29:43.999 --> 01:29:46.996
Sorry to crash your party, but...

775
01:29:47.101 --> 01:29:49.925
I heard this was where the coke was.

776
01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.171
Am I right?

777
01:29:55.275 --> 01:29:57.293
I'm more of a chocolate milk kinda guy.

778
01:30:00.547 --> 01:30:02.398
Good one.

779
01:30:03.484 --> 01:30:05.301
Very good.

780
01:30:08.789 --> 01:30:11.184
Fortunately for you,

781
01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.398
I don't want your coke.

782
01:30:17.631 --> 01:30:18.991
Or your chocolate milk.

783
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:26.895
But I do like the painting
on the wall, though.


784
01:30:29.176 --> 01:30:33.475
I've always had a thing
for beautiful art.


785
01:30:35.282 --> 01:30:37.233
Cuff them.

786
01:30:39.153 --> 01:30:41.958
My lawyer's gonna tear you to pieces.

787
01:30:57.104 --> 01:30:59.689
What do we have here?

788
01:31:01.343 --> 01:31:04.594
An emergency
million-dollar stash, maybe?


789
01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:16.397
Open...

790
01:31:16.698 --> 01:31:17.829
sesame.

791
01:31:37.044 --> 01:31:39.662
You think you're gonna
walk out with my money?


792
01:31:40.898 --> 01:31:42.691
You must be fucking crazy.

793
01:31:49.957 --> 01:31:53.374
Does anyone see any money, here?

794
01:31:53.478 --> 01:31:56.336
'Cause I don't see a damn thing.

795
01:31:57.797 --> 01:32:00.694
As a matter of fact, what safe?

796
01:32:02.653 --> 01:32:05.038
Get the fuck out of here.

797
01:32:09.843 --> 01:32:12.962
My friend that just walked out
the door was never here.


798
01:32:13.314 --> 01:32:16.279
Camron and I after our shift
came in and had a drink.


799
01:32:16.383 --> 01:32:18.382
Noticed suspicious activity.

800
01:32:18.486 --> 01:32:20.784
After further investigation,

801
01:32:20.888 --> 01:32:23.354
we fell upon a major drug transaction.

802
01:32:23.458 --> 01:32:26.656
Oh, I can see the headlines, now.

803
01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:31.795
Two Off-Duty Officers
Take Down Drug Kingpin,


804
01:32:31.899 --> 01:32:35.618
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

805
01:32:37.137 --> 01:32:38.840
Some crazy shit.

806
01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:42.261
Call that in, Camron.

807
01:32:46.847 --> 01:32:49.732
You fucking...

808
01:32:50.374 --> 01:32:52.195
moron.

809
01:32:56.357 --> 01:32:58.831
How dumb can you be?

810
01:32:59.526 --> 01:33:01.910
He was with us.

811
01:33:02.829 --> 01:33:08.432
He was working undercover
for years, you fucking idiot!


812
01:33:11.271 --> 01:33:13.604
You completely blew our entire case,

813
01:33:13.708 --> 01:33:16.974
not to mention you disgraced
the entire force,


814
01:33:17.078 --> 01:33:19.501
by stealing money...

815
01:33:19.605 --> 01:33:21.719
from a drug lord.

816
01:33:22.216 --> 01:33:24.568
Here's what's gonna happen.

817
01:33:28.088 --> 01:33:29.706
You...

818
01:33:30.257 --> 01:33:34.113
are going to jail.

819
01:33:35.062 --> 01:33:36.718
Sundown...

820
01:33:37.318 --> 01:33:40.435
is gonna have his case
thrown out by the DA,


821
01:33:40.539 --> 01:33:44.721
and he's gonna walk this afternoon
after his hearing.


822
01:33:50.010 --> 01:33:53.896
Agent Franco, on the other hand,

823
01:33:54.615 --> 01:33:57.181
is now gonna spend
his entire life in hiding


824
01:33:57.285 --> 01:33:59.753
because you thought it was smart

825
01:33:59.858 --> 01:34:04.707
to steal from Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.

826
01:34:05.592 --> 01:34:08.191
I mean, not only was your crime...

827
01:34:08.295 --> 01:34:12.247
witnessed by a federal agent,

828
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.049
but the entire thing
was caught on camera!


829
01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:30.199
You've officially traded places
with Sundown.


830
01:34:40.594 --> 01:34:43.111
Enjoy the next 20 years.

831
01:34:52.239 --> 01:34:54.456
<i>What a sad life.</i>

832
01:34:55.909 --> 01:34:59.642
<i>The ups, the downs,
the friends, the enemies.</i>


833
01:34:59.747 --> 01:35:03.948
<i>The frauds, crooks, the sneaks,
the opportunists.</i>


834
01:35:04.052 --> 01:35:07.351
<i>The traitors, the killers,
the thieves, villains,</i>


835
01:35:07.455 --> 01:35:11.139
<i>the brutes, the con-men,
the merciless, the ruthless.</i>


836
01:35:11.858 --> 01:35:13.991
<i>And what's sadder
is that to succeed in this life,</i>


837
01:35:14.095 --> 01:35:16.609
<i>you have to be the
best of all of them.</i>

838
01:35:16.714 --> 01:35:19.114
<i>Bottled into a single man.</i>

839
01:35:24.004 --> 01:35:26.138
<i>And then is me...</i>

840
01:35:26.649 --> 01:35:29.222
<i>Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.</i>

841
01:35:29.677 --> 01:35:32.610
<i>The most notorious narcotics dealer
in the northern hemisphere,</i>


842
01:35:32.714 --> 01:35:35.299
<i>and I have lived a life of crime.</i>

843
01:35:39.486 --> 01:35:41.603
<i>But no more.</i>

844
01:35:44.157 --> 01:35:48.858
<i>How do you get away with a perfect crime?
There's no such thing.</i>


845
01:35:48.963 --> 01:35:52.996
<i>How do you get away with a lifetime
of crime? That's simple.</i>


846
01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:55.198
<i>Make 'em think you haven't.</i>

847
01:35:55.302 --> 01:35:57.954
<i>I knew the feds were minutes away
from getting their man.</i>


848
01:35:58.058 --> 01:36:01.293
<i>So what did I do?
I gave 'em what they wanted.</i>


849
01:36:01.692 --> 01:36:04.707
You don't know him like I know him.
I can serve him up on a plate to you.


850
01:36:04.812 --> 01:36:06.777
You'll get that promotion
you've always been after.


851
01:36:06.881 --> 01:36:10.261
- A million dollars?
- Tax fucking free.


852
01:36:10.365 --> 01:36:14.651
<i>The corrupt cop was perfect for the job.
There's no way she could resist the bait.</i>


853
01:36:14.755 --> 01:36:16.012
He was with us.

854
01:36:16.117 --> 01:36:18.956
<i>I knew all I did was buy myself
some time, but it was necessary.</i>


855
01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:22.796
Sundown is gonna have his case
thrown out by the DA.


856
01:36:22.901 --> 01:36:26.919
And he's gonna walk this afternoon,
after his hearing.


857
01:36:27.023 --> 01:36:30.926
<i>When it came to the cartels, and the boss
down in Mexico, that was a different story.</i>


858
01:36:31.297 --> 01:36:34.590
<i>Once in that world, you can't
just leave by your own free will.</i>


859
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:37.987
Not everything is about money, son.

860
01:36:38.230 --> 01:36:39.504
Welcome to the family.

861
01:36:39.446 --> 01:36:41.979
<i>So what did I do? 
I had them oust me.</i>

862
01:36:42.083 --> 01:36:44.214
He sent me here
to give you a message.

863
01:36:44.318 --> 01:36:46.517
Boss down south,
not very pleased with you.


864
01:36:46.621 --> 01:36:48.485
Wants to know why you haven't
handled that situation.


865
01:36:48.589 --> 01:36:51.722
One week, or he handles it himself.
The choice is yours.


866
01:36:51.826 --> 01:36:53.676
My decision's been made.

867
01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:57.465
Honor and reputation go a
long way in this business.


868
01:36:57.670 --> 01:37:01.902
Her life by your hands
or your life by my hands.


869
01:37:01.986 --> 01:37:05.650
<i>Tarnished my reputation and made sure they'd
never wanna do business with me again.</i>


870
01:37:06.334 --> 01:37:07.221
<i>Señora.</i>

871
01:37:07.325 --> 01:37:10.291
- I need you to get some information for me.
- For the right price?


872
01:37:10.395 --> 01:37:12.375
<i>I found the right
guy to make it happen.</i>

873
01:37:12.479 --> 01:37:15.061
<i>Thought he was working for me,
then working against me...</i>


874
01:37:15.165 --> 01:37:18.281
Yes, I found her.
These things cost money, Sundown!


875
01:37:18.385 --> 01:37:21.870
<i>Learns he was simply working
for me the entire time.</i>


876
01:37:22.922 --> 01:37:26.156
<i>In order for dismantling an empire,
it must crumble entirely.</i>


877
01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:29.259
<i>Not one brick left standing.
Eliminate my money.</i>


878
01:37:29.363 --> 01:37:31.805
You said millions in the week.
What's the job?


879
01:37:31.909 --> 01:37:34.131
He's worth a fortune,
and I wanna rid him of some of it.


880
01:37:34.235 --> 01:37:38.088
I wanna do a money laundering job. Start
him off small, build him up to the big take.


881
01:37:38.193 --> 01:37:41.237
- Once you get him where you want him...
- Stop everything you're doing...


882
01:37:41.342 --> 01:37:43.969
and I'll make it 10 million dollars.

883
01:37:44.511 --> 01:37:47.477
- And he's all-in.
- <i>Make him think I'm destroyed.</i>


884
01:37:47.581 --> 01:37:49.905
<i>Money means power in this world,
and when it's gone</i>


885
01:37:50.010 --> 01:37:53.149
<i>you'd be surprised
how fast people disappear.</i>


886
01:37:53.253 --> 01:37:54.588
<i>And that's just what I wanted.</i>

887
01:37:55.188 --> 01:37:56.991
He's got something
that should've been mine.


888
01:37:57.190 --> 01:37:59.623
- I want you to get it for me.
- A million dollar necklace?


889
01:37:59.728 --> 01:38:02.697
- Why?
- Because he bought that chain in blood.


890
01:38:03.197 --> 01:38:05.805
<i>It was my right of passage
into this world,</i>


891
01:38:05.909 --> 01:38:09.031
<i>represented everything
I wanted to leave behind.</i>


892
01:38:09.135 --> 01:38:12.005
<i>There was no way I could've brought it
with me on my new journey.</i>


893
01:38:13.206 --> 01:38:15.589
<i>My love, my beautiful love...</i>

894
01:38:15.694 --> 01:38:19.513
I want you to kidnap someone for me.
Sonny Garcia's wife.


895
01:38:26.219 --> 01:38:30.634
<i>The saddest part of my journey,
I truly never meant for that to happen.</i>


896
01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:33.295
<i>But he sure paid for his deeds.</i>

897
01:38:33.694 --> 01:38:37.145
<i>Now, my question to you is,
who's gonna get to you first?</i>


898
01:38:39.966 --> 01:38:42.566
<i>Me, or Sonny Garcia?</i>

899
01:38:42.671 --> 01:38:45.584
<i>The job was simple. 
Two words...</i>

900
01:38:45.688 --> 01:38:47.471
<i>Kidnap. Her.</i>

901
01:38:47.575 --> 01:38:51.474
<i>That woulda bought me enough time to
execute my plan without her meddling in it.</i>


902
01:38:51.578 --> 01:38:54.645
<i>There's no way I coulda risked her
allowing them to build a case against me</i>


903
01:38:54.749 --> 01:38:56.446
<i>right before my disappearance.</i>

904
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:59.082
<i>Which brings me to that point.
My disappearance.</i>


905
01:38:59.186 --> 01:39:03.119
<i>How do you get away with a lifetime
of crime? Make them think you haven't.</i>


906
01:39:03.223 --> 01:39:05.054
<i>And in doing so, go all-in.</i>

907
01:39:05.159 --> 01:39:08.337
I want you to kill him with this gun.
It's the gun he killed me with.


908
01:39:11.533 --> 01:39:15.148
<i>As long as it's done with my own gun,
conveniently loaded with blanks,</i>


909
01:39:15.252 --> 01:39:20.340
<i>Deleted from existence...
Sonny "Sundown" Garcia is no more.</i>


910
01:39:21.374 --> 01:39:24.321
I need his assassination
to be heard all over America.


911
01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:27.524
My whole existence revolves
around the loss of his life.


912
01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:30.084
<i>The only one that's left
is our dear friend, John Doe.</i>


913
01:39:30.284 --> 01:39:33.111
- I'll be in touch.
- No, I'll be in touch.


914
01:39:35.187 --> 01:39:39.460
<i>He didn't just come from my imagination.
He lived within me.</i>


915
01:39:39.887 --> 01:39:43.193
<i>A man nobody knew but me. 
My true self.</i>

916
01:39:43.297 --> 01:39:47.092
<i>I fought Sonny down for my entire life,
but he was a monster.</i>


917
01:39:47.197 --> 01:39:49.957
<i>Undefeatable. 
Indomitable.</i>

918
01:39:50.061 --> 01:39:53.154
<i>He did things that were
unheard of. Inhuman.</i>


919
01:39:53.258 --> 01:39:58.332
<i>The only one who could take down
this beast was myself, John Doe.</i>


920
01:39:58.646 --> 01:40:01.380
<i>I loved her more
than I loved life, itself.</i>


921
01:40:01.484 --> 01:40:05.051
<i>Sometimes life gives you
difficult choices.</i>


922
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:08.508
A life for a life,

923
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:12.182
or a love for a love.

924
01:40:12.608 --> 01:40:14.693
Now his time has come.

925
01:40:15.962 --> 01:40:17.928
<i>I gave them everything they wanted.</i>

926
01:40:18.033 --> 01:40:22.599
<i>My reputation, my money,
my loyalty, my love,</i>


927
01:40:22.703 --> 01:40:25.170
<i>and ultimately my life.</i>

928
01:40:25.572 --> 01:40:27.830
<i>The only thing I kept...</i>

929
01:40:27.934 --> 01:40:29.974
<i>was my freedom.</i>
