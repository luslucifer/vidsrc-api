00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:08.991
Tim:<i>I'm running</i>
<i>for San Bernardino</i>


2
00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:10.859
<i>District Attorney.</i>

3
00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:12.928
Yeah.

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.363
I'm coming out here.

5
00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:17.299
I'm a one-man band,
meeting the businesses,


6
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:18.400
<i>talking to voters,</i>

7
00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:21.070
<i>and getting the word out</i>
<i>about my candidacy.</i>


8
00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:25.474
Yes, for District Attorney.
I've said that three times now.


9
00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:30.179
I'm not that corrupt,
Washington-style,


10
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:34.750
swamp-style...
District Attorney.


11
00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:42.224
Look, I'm strong on crime.

12
00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.594
I'm strong on crime.

13
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.598
I'm him! I don't have a beard.
I...


14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.933
He doesn't have a beard in this.

15
00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:55.537
This is me. Yeah. I am me.
I am... I just have a beard.


16
00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.006
And I have sunglasses on. See?

17
00:00:58.008 --> 00:00:59.641
That's a documentary crew
filming.


18
00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:02.478
They're making a film
about my campaign.


19
00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:03.812
See me?

20
00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:04.913
That's me. Okay?

21
00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:07.649
I just have a beard now
because we did a focus group


22
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.017
and people liked the beard.

23
00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:11.453
Toni Newman says
the beard works.


24
00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:15.124
Well, Vincent Rosetti

25
00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:17.259
and some other clown, Sandoval.

26
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:19.828
So, I'm third party.
Just look for Tim Heidecker.


27
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.330
If you have the Internet,
you can go


28
00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:24.933
to timheideckerforda.com.

29
00:01:25.035 --> 00:01:27.102
And I'm gonna bring change.

30
00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:29.171
All right?

31
00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:01.236
All the... all the chips
are in on this,


32
00:02:01.238 --> 00:02:02.771
sort of all the...

33
00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:06.742
Everything's, um,
on the line here.


34
00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:08.310
<i>And, you know, financially,</i>

35
00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:12.181
<i>emotionally, sort of,</i>
<i>where I'm at...</i>


36
00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:13.582
<i>this is sort of my...</i>

37
00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:16.485
<i>I don't wanna say my last play,</i>
<i>but it's my big play.</i>


38
00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:18.887
<i>I think we've put ourselves</i>
<i>in a perfect position</i>


39
00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.256
<i>to really come from</i>
<i>out of nowhere,</i>


40
00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:22.291
<i>be the outsider,</i>

41
00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:23.992
<i>and I think we have</i>
<i>a very good chance</i>


42
00:02:23.994 --> 00:02:25.060
<i>of winning, too.</i>

43
00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:26.995
Tim: Oh, hi. I love dogs,
so this is perfect.


44
00:02:26.997 --> 00:02:28.664
- Here's a...
- What are you running for?


45
00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:30.199
- District Attorney.
- (dog barking)


46
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:33.235
Yeah, running against
Vincent Rosetti.


47
00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:34.369
This is not a vote for me.

48
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:35.837
It's just to let me
get on the ballot.


49
00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:37.706
I'm running
as an independent candidate.


50
00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:42.778
<i>Get on the ballot is a big part</i>
<i>of my day, every day.</i>


51
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.215
At 15 signatures today,
so feeling pretty good.


52
00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:49.051
<i>We're just basically taking it</i>
<i>street by street,</i>


53
00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:51.119
<i>and it's been a slog.</i>

54
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:55.224
This is basically...
Fontana has been somewhere


55
00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:59.061
where I've pretty much covered
the past three or four days.


56
00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:01.196
<i>I'm on my own.</i>
<i>I'm a one-man band.</i>


57
00:03:01.198 --> 00:03:02.331
<i>I've got Rialto to hit.</i>

58
00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.367
<i>I've got Highland, Redlands,</i>
<i>Loma Linda,</i>


59
00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.602
<i>the city of San Bernardino,</i>

60
00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.737
<i>and we have to cover</i>
<i>all that area.</i>


61
00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.240
It's 108 degrees out.

62
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:13.308
Ugh.

63
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.876
<i>You know, it's a lot of ground</i>
<i>to cover</i>


64
00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:16.778
<i>'cause, first of all,</i>
<i>most people aren't home.</i>


65
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.315
<i>Knocking on their door</i>
<i>on a Wednesday at 1:00 p.m...</i>


66
00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:23.485
(clears throat)<i>You know,</i>
<i>I'm just... It's tough.</i>


67
00:03:23.487 --> 00:03:26.755
<i>We need, you know,</i>
<i>something like 500 signatures</i>


68
00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:28.624
<i>by next week.</i>

69
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.759
<i>But we're on track.</i>

70
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.428
We're very optimistic about it,
and that's...


71
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.696
Toni's cracking the whip on that

72
00:03:34.698 --> 00:03:36.164
'cause if we're not on
the ballot,


73
00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:40.035
then we're in real trouble.
You guys voters? You 18?


74
00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:42.471
Do you vote? No?

75
00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:45.007
I'm running
for District Attorney.


76
00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.110
No, I'm running
for District Attorney.


77
00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:49.177
Sort of like governor.

78
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.480
It's the way to change
your future.


79
00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.549
All right, thank you. Be safe.

80
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:56.118
We have tremendous, you know,

81
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.186
support on the Internet
for the campaign,


82
00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:02.157
and we have
a real movement happening.


83
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.461
Timheideckerforda.com.
It's a website.


84
00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:07.529
And you can go on there

85
00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:09.665
and fill out our petition
to get me on the ballot.


86
00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:13.068
We need 500 signatures.
And I'm strong...


87
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.506
strong on crime, no uh...

88
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:18.840
no uh...

89
00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:22.644
no more corruption, you know,
just getting Rosetti out.


90
00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:24.546
So, pass that on to your dad,
all right?


91
00:04:24.548 --> 00:04:26.548
My campaign chairman,
Toni Newman,


92
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.386
is very active in the campaign
and is doing...


93
00:04:31.388 --> 00:04:34.923
Wearing many hats,
talking to media outlets


94
00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:35.924
almost every day.

95
00:04:35.926 --> 00:04:39.928
We got the Epson printer
basically printing out


96
00:04:40.164 --> 00:04:42.030
whatever we need...

97
00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:44.466
and then
for the bigger-print stuff,


98
00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:50.505
we're going off, you know, to...
to Kinko's for that stuff.


99
00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:52.774
This is our campaign
headquarters, really,


100
00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:54.876
at this point,
until we get bigger offices.


101
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:58.547
To-do board, my strategy board,
I call it, my map.


102
00:04:58.549 --> 00:04:59.948
You know, the hotel
treats us right.


103
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.051
We got a fridge
pretty much fully stocked,


104
00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.519
whatever you need.

105
00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:08.357
Uh, TV. It's basically
your classic...


106
00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:10.025
bathroom, which is all I need.

107
00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:13.395
That's work,
and then we have, sort of...


108
00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:16.531
I don't want to say play,
but rest


109
00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:18.567
and sort of a home life,

110
00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.737
which was
one of the great reasons


111
00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.472
I picked up on this idea

112
00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:27.042
of relocating
to this beautiful hotel,


113
00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:28.176
<i>is that I could...</i>

114
00:05:28.178 --> 00:05:29.911
<i>I don't have to commute</i>
<i>or anything like that.</i>


115
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.314
<i>I can basically get right</i>
<i>to work as soon as I get up.</i>


116
00:05:32.316 --> 00:05:34.449
<i>And then I'm just</i>
<i>in the community,</i>


117
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:36.418
<i>which is great.</i>
<i>It's not necessarily</i>


118
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.619
<i>about having... 
I don't need</i>

119
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:39.554
to have lived here
my entire life


120
00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:41.223
to know the problems
and to understand


121
00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:43.225
how to fix them.
There's crime everywhere,


122
00:05:43.227 --> 00:05:46.762
and the same solution
applies to anywhere you live.


123
00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:51.099
So, if I lived here,
which I do officially...


124
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.300
This is my legal residence.

125
00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:56.204
This is where mail comes to,
when I need mail.


126
00:05:57.775 --> 00:06:01.510
It's the same anywhere. And...

127
00:06:01.578 --> 00:06:03.779
You know, if I need
to do a call in here,


128
00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:04.846
I got a phone in here.

129
00:06:04.848 --> 00:06:06.515
<i>You know, I wish</i>
<i>I had the volunteers,</i>


130
00:06:06.517 --> 00:06:09.818
<i>but I also am glad and grateful</i>
<i>that there are...</i>


131
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.586
<i>that it's me</i>
<i>coming to the door.</i>


132
00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:13.588
I'm not a career politician.
I'm an outsider.


133
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.624
Are you an attorney...
You're an attorney now?


134
00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.025
I've practiced law, yeah,

135
00:06:17.027 --> 00:06:19.628
- and I've represented myself.
- Okay.


136
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.296
I've had tremendous experience
in law,


137
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:23.331
- so there's no worries there.
- All right.


138
00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:24.866
<i>'Cause that's what's happening</i>
<i>with Rosetti,</i>


139
00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:26.735
<i>is he's hiring</i>
<i>all these people, immigrants,</i>


140
00:06:26.737 --> 00:06:29.938
people that probably
don't even have identification.


141
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.908
<i>Rosetti is paying them cash</i>
<i>to go out there</i>


142
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.910
<i>and basically offer cash</i>

143
00:06:34.912 --> 00:06:37.379
if you vote for Rosetti
if I guaran...


144
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:38.580
So, they're buying votes.

145
00:06:38.582 --> 00:06:44.352
My options were, really,
meet him again in civil court...


146
00:06:44.354 --> 00:06:48.590
to prosecute him for the crime
he committed against me,


147
00:06:48.592 --> 00:06:50.826
<i>which is</i>
<i>unlawful incrimination.</i>


148
00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:52.661
I'd rather have you guys
in the driver's seat


149
00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:55.030
than these rats here.
And they're liars.


150
00:06:55.032 --> 00:06:56.531
And I don't know
what I did to them.


151
00:06:56.533 --> 00:07:01.470
I don't know what I did to them
that they're so upset with me.


152
00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:03.705
man:<i>Tragedy struck today</i>
<i>as hundreds</i>


153
00:07:03.707 --> 00:07:05.774
<i>of musical-festival attendees</i>
<i>fell ill</i>


154
00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:09.478
<i>in what authorities are calling</i>
<i>a suspected drug overdose.</i>


155
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.680
<i>The San Bernardino County</i>
<i>Sheriff's Office</i>


156
00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:13.982
<i>has launched an investigation</i>
<i>into the event</i>


157
00:07:13.984 --> 00:07:17.285
<i>known as the Electric Sun</i>
<i>Desert Music Festival,</i>


158
00:07:17.287 --> 00:07:20.755
<i>founded this year by musician</i>
<i>and entrepreneur Tim Heidecker.</i>


159
00:07:20.757 --> 00:07:23.291
The court calls the People
of the State of California


160
00:07:23.293 --> 00:07:25.794
versus
Timothy Richard Heidecker.


161
00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:27.429
Defendant is charged with counts

162
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.131
one through 20
of second-degree felony murder.


163
00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:33.902
Vincent: He filled the lungs
of his innocent victims


164
00:07:33.904 --> 00:07:39.307
with a chemical cocktail.
These portable vaporizers...


165
00:07:39.977 --> 00:07:42.978
contain a dangerous chemical...

166
00:07:43.146 --> 00:07:47.582
known to Mr. Heidecker
to cause illness


167
00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:50.051
and be potentially fatal
when inhaled.


168
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:53.188
And Mr. Heidecker,
he'll be representing himself


169
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.891
- in this matter.
- I'm being unjustly prosecuted


170
00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:57.926
for crimes of which
I did not commit.


171
00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:01.563
woman: Your daughter was 17
when she left you.


172
00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:04.866
I would do anything
to have her back.


173
00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:07.302
And that man over there
is responsible.


174
00:08:07.304 --> 00:08:10.205
He is responsible
for me losing her.


175
00:08:10.207 --> 00:08:12.140
No, but he disobeyed me!
It's my...


176
00:08:12.142 --> 00:08:15.110
I'll fuck you up, Mark!
Believe me! I'll fuck you up!


177
00:08:15.112 --> 00:08:20.148
I have never seen
such a heinous crime


178
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.852
and such a tragedy.
See that justice is done.


179
00:08:23.854 --> 00:08:25.787
Convict this individual.

180
00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:29.925
Madam Foreperson, has the jury
reached a verdict?


181
00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:33.194
No, we were not able to reach
a unanimous decision.


182
00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:36.598
This is a mistrial,
and we are adjourned.


183
00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:39.200
Yes! Yes!

184
00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:43.038
I thank God for the one juror,
really,


185
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.040
who is sort of the stopgap here

186
00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:48.143
and created this
amazing verdict.


187
00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:50.312
It is my first time being
a juror...


188
00:08:50.314 --> 00:08:52.814
a lawyer and I've proven myself

189
00:08:52.816 --> 00:08:55.951
to be basically unstoppable
at this point.


190
00:08:55.953 --> 00:08:58.186
As far as the DA goes,
this Rosetti


191
00:08:58.188 --> 00:09:02.190
has turned out to be a total rat
and a bad, bad guy.


192
00:09:02.192 --> 00:09:04.326
And I don't know how
you find these people,


193
00:09:04.328 --> 00:09:05.460
if you elect them or not,

194
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.062
but if you have elected them,
who knows?


195
00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:09.230
maybe he'll have
some competition next time.


196
00:09:09.232 --> 00:09:12.100
Fuck this! I'm done!
You hear me!


197
00:09:12.102 --> 00:09:15.270
And I'm coming for you, Rosetti,
wherever the fuck you are!


198
00:09:15.272 --> 00:09:17.305
I'm running
for District Attorney


199
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:21.343
of San Bernardino County.
Why? Because I'm a fighter,


200
00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:23.578
and I know
what that county needs.


201
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.613
I already proved myself

202
00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:26.481
that I am the best lawyer
there's ever...


203
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.849
I won that case fair and square.

204
00:09:27.851 --> 00:09:31.319
I want to be your DA,
and I hope I have your vote.


205
00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:39.594
Edward:<i>I retired</i>
<i>about three months ago.</i>


206
00:09:39.596 --> 00:09:41.796
<i>I had a backlog</i>
<i>that I really felt</i>


207
00:09:41.798 --> 00:09:42.931
<i>I was obligated to work through</i>

208
00:09:42.933 --> 00:09:47.502
<i>and not pass off</i>
<i>onto any of my fellow judges.</i>


209
00:09:47.571 --> 00:09:49.137
<i>But I have been winding down</i>

210
00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:52.707
since not too long after
the Heidecker verdict.


211
00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:55.210
I have to say that
in all my time on the bench,


212
00:09:55.212 --> 00:09:56.544
I've never had a case like that.

213
00:09:56.546 --> 00:10:00.281
<i>Mr. Heidecker clearly had</i>
<i>no respect for decorum.</i>


214
00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:02.350
Objection. Defendant
is intimidating this witness.


215
00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.686
I am not intimidate...
I'll intimidate you.


216
00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.755
- Believe me.
- Edward: Mr. Heidecker!


217
00:10:06.757 --> 00:10:07.889
- I'm...
- Mr. Heidecker!


218
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:09.357
I'm warning you
that this is my...


219
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.059
I move to hold the defendant
in contempt.


220
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:14.562
- Judge, I promise
I'm going somewhere with this.
- Do you have a question to ask,


221
00:10:14.564 --> 00:10:16.831
as opposed to an accusation
to make?


222
00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:19.501
Frankly, he turned it
into a circus.


223
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.370
And I think we all bear
a responsibility


224
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.938
for allowing that to happen.

225
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.940
What a lot of people
don't understand


226
00:10:25.942 --> 00:10:29.244
is that I had to allow
some of that to happen.


227
00:10:29.246 --> 00:10:31.713
<i>I had a constitutional duty...</i>

228
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.983
<i>to allow Mr. Heidecker</i>
<i>to represent himself</i>


229
00:10:34.985 --> 00:10:39.320
and to let him
do the best he could.


230
00:10:40.157 --> 00:10:41.890
So, I think a lot
of the criticism


231
00:10:41.892 --> 00:10:45.226
that's been leveled against me
is simply ignorant.


232
00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.327
<i>People don't understand</i>

233
00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:48.296
<i>that that's a very</i>
<i>different situation.</i>


234
00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:50.865
From the volume of hate mail
I received


235
00:10:50.867 --> 00:10:54.469
from people who were irate
about that verdict,


236
00:10:54.538 --> 00:10:56.838
my perception is that...

237
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.407
in large sections
of San Bernardino County,


238
00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.343
Mr. Heidecker
is persona non grata.


239
00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:05.547
He is perceived as a charlatan.

240
00:11:05.549 --> 00:11:09.918
He's perceived as a murderer

241
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.920
who got away with it...

242
00:11:12.055 --> 00:11:13.488
um...

243
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.857
by manipulating the system.

244
00:11:15.859 --> 00:11:19.494
Yes, one juror held out,
but as far as the election goes,


245
00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:21.396
I take great comfort
from the fact


246
00:11:21.398 --> 00:11:23.631
that 11 out of 12...

247
00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:26.768
were convinced
beyond a reasonable doubt...


248
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.839
that he was guilty of at least
second-degree felony murder.


249
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:35.143
So, if 11 out of 12 eligible
voters in San Bernardino County


250
00:11:35.145 --> 00:11:36.578
believe that...

251
00:11:37.247 --> 00:11:39.114
he doesn't have a chance.

252
00:11:39.182 --> 00:11:40.081
Josh:

253
00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:42.917
Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes.

254
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.552
Josh:

255
00:11:44.554 --> 00:11:48.356
Well, you know, this is, uh...

256
00:11:48.358 --> 00:11:51.526
this is the most serious race
I've run in.


257
00:11:51.528 --> 00:11:56.564
You don't want guys that have
sort of career politicians.


258
00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:58.333
I think that's my point,
is you don't want...


259
00:11:58.335 --> 00:12:00.201
you want an outsider to come in
and shake things up


260
00:12:00.203 --> 00:12:03.404
because San Bernardino
has gotten to be so corrupt.


261
00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:07.842
And the crime has skyrocketed.
We have crime stats here.


262
00:12:07.844 --> 00:12:09.277
All these numbers,
if you see the...


263
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:11.579
You can almost look
from a 30,000-foot view,


264
00:12:11.581 --> 00:12:15.517
you see that it's just up, up,
up, and that's all crime.


265
00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:19.354
You know, really a lot
of big problems here, which...


266
00:12:19.356 --> 00:12:20.388
We want to be realistic,

267
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.626
but I'd say a 100 percent
elimination of crime...


268
00:12:24.628 --> 00:12:28.463
is our goal. And that's,
I think, very doable.


269
00:12:29.366 --> 00:12:33.268
We are off to one of my
favorite family restaurants


270
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.403
in the San Bernardino County.

271
00:12:35.405 --> 00:12:39.274
And we're gonna be meeting
with my campaign chairman,


272
00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:41.576
Toni Newman.
Really a brilliant strategist,


273
00:12:41.578 --> 00:12:46.214
a brilliant political mind
who knows the issues


274
00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:48.983
and believes in me
as a candidate,


275
00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:50.518
and, frankly, I...

276
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.822
you know, sees me going
far, far, far beyond


277
00:12:53.824 --> 00:12:57.091
simply, District Attorney.

278
00:12:57.093 --> 00:13:01.696
You know, national office,
national positions.


279
00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:04.666
So, we'll...

280
00:13:04.734 --> 00:13:07.735
- (watch chimes)
- On my way.


281
00:13:10.173 --> 00:13:11.439
On...

282
00:13:11.575 --> 00:13:13.107
(watch dings)

283
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.310
On...

284
00:13:16.413 --> 00:13:19.380
- (watch dings)
- Okay.


285
00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.884
We'll be there in five minutes.

286
00:13:23.353 --> 00:13:24.652
- (bell chimes)
- How you doing?


287
00:13:24.654 --> 00:13:26.454
- Mel: Good. Hi. How are you?
- Tim: Good. How are you?


288
00:13:26.456 --> 00:13:27.922
- I'm Tim Heidecker.
- Tim, nice to meet you.


289
00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:29.757
Yeah.
Running for District Attorney.


290
00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:31.926
How's it going? 
Nice to see you.

291
00:13:31.928 --> 00:13:33.294
<i>-</i> woman:<i>Hola.</i>
- How you doing?


292
00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:34.996
I'm Tim Heidecker.
Nice to meet you.


293
00:13:34.998 --> 00:13:38.099
Running for District Attorney.
Y'all registered voters, I hope?


294
00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:39.801
I'm not wasting my time
over here?


295
00:13:39.803 --> 00:13:41.469
- man: Absolutely.
- Great.


296
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:42.503
Sorry I'm late.

297
00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:44.772
- Well...
- This is Toni Newman,


298
00:13:44.774 --> 00:13:48.977
my campaign chairm...
chairwoman, chairman, whatever.


299
00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:51.546
I come
from an advertising background,


300
00:13:51.548 --> 00:13:52.614
outside advertising.

301
00:13:52.616 --> 00:13:56.718
I've got about 17, 20 years
in advertising, so...


302
00:13:56.853 --> 00:13:58.086
Tim: Which is ultimately...

303
00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:00.088
You were telling me this,
that a campaign, a candidate,


304
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.256
is essentially a product, is...

305
00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:03.491
Why don't you
bring me up to speed?


306
00:14:03.493 --> 00:14:05.760
Well, you know,
I've just been out canvassing.


307
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.930
I mean, I'm getting signatures
at a rate that concerns me


308
00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:10.832
because it's not the rate
that is gonna get us


309
00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:13.534
to where we need to be,
according to you.


310
00:14:13.536 --> 00:14:14.769
Well, we can't get on the ballot

311
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.537
- if we don't have
enough signatures.
- I understand.


312
00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:18.773
So we need to find a way to...

313
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.975
- We need
to figure out something.
- Well, let's just


314
00:14:20.977 --> 00:14:21.843
put that aside.

315
00:14:21.845 --> 00:14:23.144
Let's put that
on the back burner.


316
00:14:23.146 --> 00:14:26.014
Can we get...
Yeah, we're very hungry.


317
00:14:26.016 --> 00:14:27.916
I have to try
those peanut butter...


318
00:14:27.918 --> 00:14:30.184
that peanut butter
chocolate banana pie.


319
00:14:30.186 --> 00:14:31.886
You know, just sort of
the classic omelet.


320
00:14:31.888 --> 00:14:34.289
- What's the classic omelet?
- waitress: Do you want to do
the four and 20 omelet?


321
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.257
- Yeah, let's do that.
That sounds great.
- waitress: Sure.


322
00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:38.192
What kind of wine
do you have, a red wine?


323
00:14:38.194 --> 00:14:40.828
waitress: Red? We have a Merlot.
We have Cabernet.


324
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.131
- We have Pinot Noir.
- Pinot?


325
00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.632
- Thank you so much.
- waitress: Mm-hmm.


326
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.302
Are you registered to vote
in the area?


327
00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:48.903
- waitress: Not in this area.
- Tim: Okay.


328
00:14:48.905 --> 00:14:52.540
'Cause I felt like we had
a connection from the beginning.


329
00:14:52.542 --> 00:14:53.508
Tim: Oh, yeah.

330
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.376
- And I felt like...
- Tim: That was there.


331
00:14:55.378 --> 00:14:56.444
...we should be a team,

332
00:14:56.446 --> 00:15:00.949
that we could put things back
in their proper place.


333
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:03.151
Tim: Yeah, because you're
from this area,


334
00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.385
so you know even more than I do.

335
00:15:04.387 --> 00:15:07.255
- Yes, I'm from San Bernardino.
- And you were talking to me


336
00:15:07.257 --> 00:15:08.923
about the demographics change.

337
00:15:08.925 --> 00:15:11.559
It's not the same city
that I grew up in.


338
00:15:11.561 --> 00:15:13.194
- It's absolutely changed.
- Mm-hmm.


339
00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:15.129
- And it's not safe anymore.
- No.


340
00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:17.899
And you know exactly
what I'm talking about...


341
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:21.502
- don't you?
- Yeah. Well, I think we all do.


342
00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:22.704
Oh, thank you.

343
00:15:22.706 --> 00:15:24.138
- Tim: That's a big pour.
- Wow.


344
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.774
And you have shown me
just unbelievable graphics that


345
00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:30.712
you've pulled off the Internet,
unbelievable stats that,


346
00:15:30.714 --> 00:15:34.115
when you look
at the Hispanic population,


347
00:15:34.117 --> 00:15:35.850
- Asian population...
- Toni: I mean, you could look


348
00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.352
through the newspaper,
and you can...


349
00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.787
- Tim: You see it, yeah.
- ...see the crime.


350
00:15:39.789 --> 00:15:42.724
I feel like a minority
in my own city,


351
00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:46.094
- to be quite honest with you.
- That's kind of interesting.


352
00:15:46.096 --> 00:15:47.328
You can't be safe there anymore.

353
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.498
And Rosetti is behind
a lot of this.


354
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.800
It's sort of like this
kind of three-stage thing.


355
00:15:52.802 --> 00:15:54.168
It's, "We have a rat problem."

356
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.670
And I wish you'd give me
a pen that works.


357
00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:58.039
Here, let me give you
another one. "Get him out."


358
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.575
- So, once you get
into office...
- Tim: Well, yeah,


359
00:16:00.577 --> 00:16:01.642
but before that,

360
00:16:01.644 --> 00:16:03.511
acknowledge that we have
a rat problem.


361
00:16:03.513 --> 00:16:05.747
So, we have a rat problem.
That's one.


362
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:09.517
- Then we set the rat trap.
- Set the trap.


363
00:16:10.954 --> 00:16:13.221
Tim: So, that's... Yeah,
we have a rat problem.


364
00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:14.188
Set the rat trap.

365
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.923
waitress: There we go.
Food coming in.


366
00:16:15.925 --> 00:16:17.859
Tim: But I would like
more specifics.


367
00:16:17.861 --> 00:16:19.494
In terms of setting the trap,

368
00:16:19.496 --> 00:16:21.396
we need to force him
into the corner


369
00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:26.200
to come to the debate,
to come to the town hall debate.


370
00:16:26.302 --> 00:16:28.436
Toni: Yeah, but that's gonna be
difficult to do.


371
00:16:28.438 --> 00:16:30.238
He's not gonna want to interact
with you.


372
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.672
- He's already...
- Well, of course,


373
00:16:31.674 --> 00:16:34.042
because he knows
he would lose the debate,


374
00:16:34.044 --> 00:16:35.243
just like he lost in court.

375
00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.945
I love that, sort of,
Rocky Balboa,


376
00:16:37.947 --> 00:16:39.680
you know,
underdog position to be in.


377
00:16:39.682 --> 00:16:41.382
I don't think there's
a better position to be in,


378
00:16:41.384 --> 00:16:43.184
especially when you're fighting
up against the powers


379
00:16:43.186 --> 00:16:44.952
that be of Rosetti
and the machine,


380
00:16:44.954 --> 00:16:46.587
the San Bernardino machine,

381
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:50.992
which includes people like
Symczyk, who is in that...


382
00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:54.462
is part of that, you know...

383
00:16:54.464 --> 00:16:55.730
He's the other one. He retired.

384
00:16:55.732 --> 00:16:59.000
He got out 'cause he knew
that he ran a kangaroo court.


385
00:16:59.002 --> 00:17:00.868
- Toni: But keep in mind...
- You did hear that, right?


386
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.804
- He retired. He's done.
- Toni: I did hear it.
He's done.


387
00:17:02.806 --> 00:17:04.839
- Tim: He's done.
He got laughed out.
- Toni: He's washed up.


388
00:17:04.841 --> 00:17:06.707
- I know.
- Tim: He got laughed out
of the courtroom.


389
00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:08.443
I heard about it.
We were a team then.


390
00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:10.545
You didn't know it.
You didn't know me.


391
00:17:10.547 --> 00:17:11.813
This is sort of the big reveal.

392
00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:13.247
- I was on the jury...
- Tim: Mm-hmm.


393
00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:16.350
...and thanks to me,
I got him off.


394
00:17:16.352 --> 00:17:21.189
And I got a phone call kind of
out of the blue from Toni.


395
00:17:21.191 --> 00:17:23.191
We met up,
and it was a long lunch,


396
00:17:23.193 --> 00:17:25.226
a lot of gratefulness
coming from me,


397
00:17:25.228 --> 00:17:29.163
a lot of respect for you
and your mind.


398
00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:31.833
I knew that Tim was a guy
that was gonna


399
00:17:31.835 --> 00:17:33.234
- help me...
- Hmm.


400
00:17:33.236 --> 00:17:34.268
...accomplish the change

401
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.071
that I know
that San Bernardino needs.


402
00:17:37.073 --> 00:17:38.573
And I saw the corruption
in Rosetti.


403
00:17:38.575 --> 00:17:41.109
As soon as that man opened
his mouth, I could see it.


404
00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:43.444
The campaign sort of
began then, didn't it?


405
00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:45.113
- Toni: Kind of, yeah.
- I want to know


406
00:17:45.115 --> 00:17:46.314
where the pie is.

407
00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:48.549
Did we forget about the pie?

408
00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:50.785
waitress: Do you want them now
or to go?


409
00:17:50.787 --> 00:17:51.719
Well, no, now.

410
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:53.154
- Toni: He wants it now.
- I mean, I could eat it


411
00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:55.156
- with the breakfast.
- Okay.


412
00:17:58.094 --> 00:17:59.160
Tim: At some point soon,

413
00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:02.096
we need to kind of address
the elephant in the room


414
00:18:02.098 --> 00:18:05.032
and start getting
some kind of staff going.


415
00:18:05.034 --> 00:18:08.936
I've got some flags out there
and working with people.


416
00:18:08.938 --> 00:18:10.438
- Tim: Yeah.
- It's not easy


417
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.472
to get money, though.

418
00:18:11.474 --> 00:18:12.773
- I mean, we're...
- Toni: I know.


419
00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:13.975
We're less than two weeks out.

420
00:18:13.977 --> 00:18:15.543
Toni: But we don't have
the signatures, Tim.


421
00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:16.777
Once we get the signatures,

422
00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:18.613
I think people will be
more apt to give money


423
00:18:18.615 --> 00:18:20.715
because they know
that you're on the ballot.


424
00:18:20.717 --> 00:18:22.216
Tim: Okay, well,
we're talking in circles


425
00:18:22.218 --> 00:18:24.418
because we need money
to get the volunteers


426
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.586
so we can get the signatures.

427
00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:26.787
But this is what it is, folks.

428
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:28.956
I mean, this is the grind
of the campaign.


429
00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.359
Right now we're operating
on a shoestring budget.


430
00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:34.762
Uh, a lot of it's coming out
of my personal account.


431
00:18:34.764 --> 00:18:37.465
And Toni's contributed some.

432
00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:41.302
We don't want that corrupt,
dark money...


433
00:18:41.604 --> 00:18:43.971
because then I become a puppet
of those people.


434
00:18:43.973 --> 00:18:47.475
We would love the big bucks
through small donations,


435
00:18:47.477 --> 00:18:50.111
is sort of our dream.
Or one big donor.


436
00:18:50.113 --> 00:18:52.813
- waitress: There's the pie.
- Thank you. And I do apologize.


437
00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:55.483
We're just on
a rough schedule today.


438
00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:56.584
Let's get a shot of this.

439
00:18:56.586 --> 00:18:59.453
I mean, this is
San Bernardino right here.


440
00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:01.822
- Toni:<i>Is that awesome?</i>
- Tim:<i>This is how it goes.</i>


441
00:19:01.824 --> 00:19:03.724
You have to create
your own momentum.


442
00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:05.960
You have to create
your own media, really.


443
00:19:05.962 --> 00:19:08.396
- Okay. Hi. This is Tim.
<i>- Yes, I know.</i>


444
00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:11.365
Toni:<i>Tim Heidecker.</i>
<i>I wanted to introduce you.</i>


445
00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:13.701
<i>- Go ahead, Tim.</i>
<i>- Hi, everybody.</i>


446
00:19:13.703 --> 00:19:14.769
<i>This is Tim Heidecker,</i>

447
00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:17.238
<i>running for District Attorney</i>
<i>for San Bernardino.</i>


448
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.208
<i>I'm sitting here at one of</i>
<i>my favorite family restaurants</i>


449
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.509
<i>in San Bernardino County,</i>

450
00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:25.112
<i>about to dig in to their</i>

<i>- Mm!</i>


455

- Toni:<i>Is it amazing?</i>
<i>- I'm gonna come back for this.</i>


456
00:19:38.528 --> 00:19:39.894
<i>This is a great piece of pie.</i>

459
00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:48.169
(indistinct chatter)

460
00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:49.303
<i>I look forwarding to...</i>

<i>Say no to Rosetti.</i>

465
00:19:58.314 --> 00:19:59.914
<i>We have a rat problem,</i>

<i>I am here to exterminate it,</i>

467
00:20:03.019 --> 00:20:06.153

468

<i>- Tim... go to timheidecker...</i>
- Perfect.


469
00:20:09.158 --> 00:20:10.758
Put that up on Twitter
and Facebook


470
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.026
- on the site.
- Toni: I will.


471
00:20:12.028 --> 00:20:14.495
How about we open
an Instagram account?


472
00:20:14.497 --> 00:20:16.097
Tim: Well, yeah,
we should have that already.


473
00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:18.199
Toni: GoFundMe, Instagram.
Facebook's up.


474
00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:20.201
- I'll work on the billboards.
- Okay. All right.


475
00:20:20.203 --> 00:20:21.969
- Toni: Okay?
- I think that's good.


476
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.738
- You got this?
- Toni: Yeah?


477
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.307
Get that, and we'll deal
with the details later.


478
00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:29.176
I'll see you back at the...
at the office.


479
00:20:29.178 --> 00:20:30.745
- Bye, Tim. Bye.
- Thank you so much.


480
00:20:30.747 --> 00:20:32.613
- Toni: See you a little later.
- Tim: Okay. See you later.


481
00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:34.682
And look for me,
Tim Heidecker for DA.


482
00:20:34.684 --> 00:20:37.852
Mel? Could be a man
or a female, Mel.


483
00:20:37.854 --> 00:20:40.187
- Mel: All right. See you.
- All right.


484
00:20:40.189 --> 00:20:44.492
(indistinct chatter)

485
00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.330
Gregg:

486
00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:11.285
Josh:<i>And if you can</i>
<i>just count to three.</i>


487
00:21:11.287 --> 00:21:15.256
- Three, two, one, action.
- Josh: A few more levels here.


488
00:21:15.258 --> 00:21:16.490
If you could just
state your name


489
00:21:16.492 --> 00:21:18.125
and what you had for breakfast.

490
00:21:18.127 --> 00:21:21.162
Gregg Turkington
from<i>On Cinema at the Cinema</i>


491
00:21:21.164 --> 00:21:26.300
and<i>Decker vs. Dracula</i>
and<i>Ant-Man,</i> and I...


492
00:21:26.302 --> 00:21:28.769
Actually,
this is my breakfast, so...


493
00:21:28.771 --> 00:21:30.371
Josh: So, tell me, Gregg,
how did you come


494
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:31.439
to meet Tim Heidecker?

495
00:21:31.441 --> 00:21:32.973
How did you first
get involved with him?


496
00:21:32.975 --> 00:21:34.709
Well, first I just wanted
to say you're probably wondering


497
00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:38.679
why I chose this park
as a place to meet.


498
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:40.448
And it's actually
an interesting story.


499
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.118
This is kind of
a historic movie site.


500
00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:46.387
Have you seen
the<i>Oh, God!</i> movie


501
00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:49.056
with George Burns
and John Denver?


502
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:50.624
- Josh:
- In that spot,


503
00:21:50.626 --> 00:21:54.228
Tracy throws a basket
from far away


504
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.031
and makes it perfectly,
and that's when Shingo thinks,


505
00:21:57.033 --> 00:21:59.967
"Okay, she must be
affiliated with God,"


506
00:21:59.969 --> 00:22:01.535
'cause she couldn't make
that shot otherwise.


507
00:22:01.537 --> 00:22:04.405
So, that's where this... that's
exactly where this was filmed.


508
00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:07.441
Josh: What's your relationship
with Tim Heidecker?


509
00:22:07.443 --> 00:22:10.745
Well, it started out
just as a guest on the show


510
00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:12.780
<i>On Cinema at the Cinema.</i>

511
00:22:12.782 --> 00:22:15.883
(intro music playing)

512
00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:18.018
Hi, everybody.
My name is Tim Heidecker.


513
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.688
And welcome to the first episode
of my new show,


514
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.289
<i>On Cinema at the Cinema.</i>

515
00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:24.158
Congratulations
on the TV series.


516
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.227
Thanks very much.
This is our first episode,


517
00:22:26.229 --> 00:22:27.795
so we're just sort of
working out the kinks


518
00:22:27.797 --> 00:22:29.330
and having a lot of fun
doing it, as well.


519
00:22:29.332 --> 00:22:31.499
Gregg:<i>But then I was bringing</i>
<i>so much expertise</i>


520
00:22:31.501 --> 00:22:32.800
<i>to the show and stuff that,</i>

521
00:22:32.802 --> 00:22:35.836
<i>after the first episode,</i>
<i>I think he realized,</i>


522
00:22:35.838 --> 00:22:37.705
<i>"Why bring in different guests</i>
<i>each week?</i>


523
00:22:37.707 --> 00:22:39.407
<i>Why not just have</i>
<i>a resident expert?"</i>


524
00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:42.710
<i>And so I ended up taking</i>
<i>a bigger and bigger and bigger</i>


525
00:22:42.712 --> 00:22:44.745
<i>and bigger and bigger role</i>
<i>in that until,</i>


526
00:22:44.747 --> 00:22:47.915
<i>finally, that's why people</i>
<i>were tuning in to the show,</i>


527
00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:50.951
was to get
that kind of movie expertise.


528
00:22:51.154 --> 00:22:54.522
Hey, everybody. Welcome back
to another episode of<i>On Cinema.</i>


529
00:22:54.524 --> 00:22:56.123
I'm your host, 
Tim Heidecker.

530
00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:57.491
He got in over his head,
you know,


531
00:22:57.493 --> 00:22:59.093
with some of his legal troubles
and things


532
00:22:59.095 --> 00:23:01.262
and also the fact
that he doesn't know anything
about movies.


533
00:23:01.264 --> 00:23:04.598
Prepping for the Electric Sun
Desert Music Festival


534
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.269
coming up in a couple...
this coming week, actually.


535
00:23:08.271 --> 00:23:09.937
The good Dr. San and I

536
00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:13.207
have developed
this very special blend,


537
00:23:13.209 --> 00:23:14.975
TCH vape system.

538
00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:19.447
We're gonna be giving away
as much as we can.


539
00:23:19.449 --> 00:23:21.816
Josh:

540
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:23.384
- For murder, yeah.
- Josh: For murder.


541
00:23:23.386 --> 00:23:25.453
For murder. There were other
legal troubles before that.


542
00:23:25.455 --> 00:23:28.823
In fact, one thing
that was never filed in court


543
00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:31.292
was that he used my credit card

544
00:23:31.294 --> 00:23:33.761
to fund the second season
of<i>Decker,</i>


545
00:23:33.763 --> 00:23:35.062
which was shot in Hawaii.

546
00:23:35.064 --> 00:23:39.133
And he owes me
just under 10,000 dollars.


547
00:23:39.135 --> 00:23:41.135
Strangely enough,
he doesn't have money


548
00:23:41.137 --> 00:23:42.336
to pay me back, but you see

549
00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:44.305
that he has money
for all these other schemes


550
00:23:44.307 --> 00:23:45.406
that he comes up with.

551
00:23:45.408 --> 00:23:48.409
These, like, protein-powder
type products


552
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:51.412
<i>or something that are supposed</i>
<i>to eliminate germs.</i>


553
00:23:51.414 --> 00:23:53.380
He's got this awful band
called Dekkar,


554
00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:56.450
<i>and they press up thousands</i>
<i>of these CDs, and they just...</i>


555
00:23:56.452 --> 00:23:58.219
<i>I think they take them</i>
<i>all to the dump...</i>


556
00:23:58.221 --> 00:24:00.855
I don't know,
because nobody wants them.


557
00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:02.256
His ex-wife, Ayaka's family,

558
00:24:02.258 --> 00:24:04.425
they financed this movie theater
which he burned down.


559
00:24:04.427 --> 00:24:08.496
I hope he never sees this film
because if he sees this hat...


560
00:24:08.764 --> 00:24:09.763
he's gonna lose it.

561
00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:11.165
He's gonna get so angry
at you guys


562
00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:14.401
'cause he doesn't allow people
to wear movie hats.


563
00:24:14.403 --> 00:24:16.303
Mark, who's a good friend
of mine,


564
00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:18.038
<i>who's also a movie buff,</i>

565
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.274
<i>lost a lot of oxygen</i>
<i>to the brain,</i>


566
00:24:20.276 --> 00:24:21.408
<i>so he was a vegetable.</i>

567
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.811
<i>And we thought he was dead,</i>
<i>but he wasn't dead.</i>


568
00:24:23.813 --> 00:24:25.679
<i>He's alive, but he's in a coma,</i>

569
00:24:25.681 --> 00:24:28.716
and it's all because Tim
didn't get real scuba equipment.


570
00:24:28.718 --> 00:24:31.318
He thought there were only
three<i>Jaws</i> movies,


571
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.887
and I had to let him know
there were more.


572
00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:35.656
He's on Twitter saying
that there's gonna be


573
00:24:35.658 --> 00:24:36.891
a movie called<i>Whale Man.</i>

574
00:24:36.893 --> 00:24:39.393
<i>And if you were gonna</i>
<i>make a movie about a whale,</i>


575
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:41.095
you would do a Moby Dick movie,

576
00:24:41.097 --> 00:24:42.630
which is already
a successful franchise.


577
00:24:42.632 --> 00:24:48.669
And he says no vaccines. Well,
then little Tom Cruise Jr. died.


578
00:24:49.038 --> 00:24:50.304
<i>And, you know,</i>

579
00:24:50.306 --> 00:24:51.772
<i>it doesn't faze Tim any,</i>
<i>though.</i>


580
00:24:51.774 --> 00:24:53.440
He's right back
with his latest scheme.


581
00:24:53.442 --> 00:24:57.945
He's running for District
Attorney, which is not...


582
00:24:57.947 --> 00:25:00.548
not gonna really happen
because he's not a lawyer.


583
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.616
He doesn't live
in San Bernardino.


584
00:25:02.618 --> 00:25:08.222
Have you seen a movie from 1976
starring Dean Jones


585
00:25:08.224 --> 00:25:10.658
called<i>The Shaggy DA?</i>

586
00:25:10.726 --> 00:25:11.492
Josh:

587
00:25:11.494 --> 00:25:13.827
You should see this movie.
It's a very funny movie.


588
00:25:13.829 --> 00:25:16.764
The character of Dean Jones...
(clears throat)


589
00:25:16.766 --> 00:25:19.133
...is running for DA, okay?

590
00:25:19.135 --> 00:25:21.802
And he has a secret he wants
to keep from the voters,


591
00:25:21.804 --> 00:25:25.172
and the secret is,
he keeps turning into a dog.


592
00:25:25.174 --> 00:25:27.575
You could almost say Tim's...

593
00:25:27.643 --> 00:25:30.978
his whole campaign
is an unofficial remake


594
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.046
of<i>The Shaggy DA</i>

595
00:25:32.048 --> 00:25:34.315
because he keeps turning into
a dog in front of the voters,


596
00:25:34.317 --> 00:25:37.484
except not a dog, more of,
a murderer or an arsonist


597
00:25:37.486 --> 00:25:41.021
or he's unmasked as somebody
who doesn't know anything
about movies


598
00:25:41.023 --> 00:25:44.158
or he doesn't know anything
about the law or what have you.


599
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.029
<i>The Garbage Pail Kids Movie</i>
from 1987 with Anthony Newley...


600
00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:51.865
- was actually also shot
in this park.
- (cellphone chimes)


601
00:25:51.867 --> 00:25:53.200
Hold on.

602
00:25:58.908 --> 00:26:02.009
All right, I got to get going.
Um...


603
00:26:05.881 --> 00:26:07.314
Actually...

604
00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:10.451
if you guys want to come along
and see something that...


605
00:26:10.453 --> 00:26:12.119
in light of what
we've been talking about,


606
00:26:12.121 --> 00:26:14.154
I think you'd find
very interesting.


607
00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:17.491
My source said
it's just past the mailbox.


608
00:26:19.028 --> 00:26:21.195
Okay. Here we go.

609
00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:26.133
See, these are children's films,

610
00:26:26.135 --> 00:26:28.268
so that's not of any use
to the archives,


611
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.006
but this is a sealed copy
of<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>


612
00:26:32.008 --> 00:26:34.675
which actually won
two Academy Awards,


613
00:26:34.677 --> 00:26:37.511
including Best Picture
and Best Actress.


614
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:40.247
<i>Bringing Down the House</i> with
Steve Martin and Queen Latifah.


615
00:26:40.249 --> 00:26:45.452
This is a great popcorn classic,
one of the funniest movies ever.


616
00:26:47.657 --> 00:26:49.423
A hundred and five minutes.

617
00:26:49.425 --> 00:26:53.227
This is an audiobook.
It does not belong here.


618
00:26:53.229 --> 00:26:54.294
Onto the next location.

619
00:26:54.296 --> 00:26:55.896
<i>This is the kind of thing</i>
<i>that Tim,</i>


620
00:26:55.898 --> 00:26:57.531
<i>since that's what</i>
<i>your film's about...</i>


621
00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:59.066
this is the kind of thing
he would never do.


622
00:26:59.068 --> 00:27:00.501
He doesn't really care
about movies.


623
00:27:00.503 --> 00:27:02.002
You guys know where
to get in touch with me


624
00:27:02.004 --> 00:27:04.705
if you want to discuss
any of this further,


625
00:27:04.707 --> 00:27:08.208
or come by and just film
at the VFA.


626
00:27:08.678 --> 00:27:10.444
Tim:<i>Call...</i>

627
00:27:12.014 --> 00:27:15.282
- Call Gregg Turkington.
- (watch dings)


628
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:17.551
- (watch dings)
- Come on!


629
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.153
It's Tim Heidecker.
I just got word


630
00:27:19.155 --> 00:27:22.389
that a filmmaker that's been
following me around, Josh.


631
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:23.991
Has... you contacted him
and you've been


632
00:27:23.993 --> 00:27:26.827
speaking with him?
Is that right?


633
00:27:27.329 --> 00:27:29.930
Gregg:

634
00:27:29.932 --> 00:27:33.701
Hey, Gregg, stay the fuck
out of my movie, okay?


635
00:27:33.703 --> 00:27:35.002
Nobody wants
to hear from you.


636
00:27:35.004 --> 00:27:37.204
This is about
my political career.


637
00:27:37.206 --> 00:27:38.405
This has nothing to do with you.

638
00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:40.340
It has nothing to do
with your fucking movies.


639
00:27:40.342 --> 00:27:41.141
Gregg:

640
00:27:41.143 --> 00:27:42.643
Well, what are you
talking to him about?


641
00:27:42.645 --> 00:27:45.546
What the hell does he
have to do with you?


642
00:27:45.548 --> 00:27:49.650
Gregg:

643
00:27:49.652 --> 00:27:52.486
Well, stay the fuck
away from Josh.


644
00:27:52.488 --> 00:27:55.956
Stay away from his fucking crew,
stay away from me,


645
00:27:55.958 --> 00:27:57.624
and you stay... get...

646
00:27:57.626 --> 00:27:59.093
Gregg:

647
00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:00.794
They are not... No.
That is not...


648
00:28:00.796 --> 00:28:03.030
You're lying to me.
That's not what Josh said.


649
00:28:03.032 --> 00:28:05.032
He said that you wanted
to talk to him about...


650
00:28:05.034 --> 00:28:07.735
- You... you...
- Gregg:


651
00:28:08.337 --> 00:28:09.436
Gregg:

652
00:28:09.438 --> 00:28:10.971
No. Stay out of my life.

653
00:28:10.973 --> 00:28:13.874
- Good luck with the... good...
- Gregg:


654
00:28:15.244 --> 00:28:17.144
All right. Goodbye.
You got nothing to say.


655
00:28:17.146 --> 00:28:21.048
You're a loser. Fuck you.
Stay out of my life.


656
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:27.221
(clears throat)

657
00:28:31.227 --> 00:28:34.128
Tim: Oh, yeah. That's great.

658
00:28:37.233 --> 00:28:38.232
Look at this.

659
00:28:38.234 --> 00:28:40.100
I wanted it to say, "Houston,
we have a rat problem,"


660
00:28:40.102 --> 00:28:43.337
but we didn't... felt that was
a little confusing.


661
00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:47.407
It's sort of from that,
<i>Ocean's...</i>


662
00:28:47.409 --> 00:28:48.542
<i>Ocean's...</i> What is it?

663
00:28:48.544 --> 00:28:51.779
<i>Apollo 13,</i>
"Houston, we have a problem."


664
00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:54.581
This is, "Houston,
we have a rat problem,"


665
00:28:54.583 --> 00:28:56.016
or just,
"We have a rat problem."


666
00:28:56.018 --> 00:29:00.254
Five thousand of these and then
a little more literature here.


667
00:29:00.256 --> 00:29:02.823
"Vincent Rosetti tried"...

668
00:29:02.825 --> 00:29:06.426
"Vincent Rosetti tried to put
an innocent man in prison.


669
00:29:06.428 --> 00:29:08.162
Now he wants to get re-elected?"

670
00:29:08.164 --> 00:29:10.798
And then it's Roset...
Me, as you can see,


671
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.468
as the exterminator,
Rosetti the Rat.


672
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.471
That's him.
We're about to bring change.


673
00:29:17.473 --> 00:29:19.740
I've talked to you guys
about that.


674
00:29:19.742 --> 00:29:21.942
(grunts) Let's do it.

675
00:29:22.945 --> 00:29:24.978
And my keys are in my room.

676
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.880
Okay, we'll be back soon.

677
00:29:27.316 --> 00:29:28.682
Shit.

678
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:32.686
All right, let's do the work
we need to do.


679
00:29:34.623 --> 00:29:38.725
- Excuse me.
Can we put this in your window?
- woman: Yeah?


680
00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:39.993
Yeah, go ahead.

681
00:29:39.995 --> 00:29:42.129
Great. Should have brought tape.

682
00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:43.263
Do you have any masking tape

683
00:29:43.265 --> 00:29:44.998
or Scotch tape
or anything like that?


684
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.368
- man:
Right by the cash register.
- Oh, perfect.


685
00:29:50.773 --> 00:29:52.706
That looks pretty good, huh?

686
00:29:58.113 --> 00:29:59.246
Hi, there.

687
00:29:59.248 --> 00:30:00.681
I'm running
for District Attorney.


688
00:30:00.683 --> 00:30:03.116
My name is Tim Heidecker.
My name is Tim Heidecker.


689
00:30:03.118 --> 00:30:04.585
I'm running
for District Attorney.


690
00:30:04.587 --> 00:30:06.153
I'm running
for District Attorney


691
00:30:06.155 --> 00:30:07.421
of San Bernardino County.

692
00:30:07.423 --> 00:30:09.590
Would it be okay
to put these up in your window,


693
00:30:09.592 --> 00:30:10.991
- just one of them? Thank you.
- Sure.


694
00:30:10.993 --> 00:30:12.626
Just wanted to see
if you would be okay with me


695
00:30:12.628 --> 00:30:15.028
putting some of my literature
in your window?


696
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.497
- Okay.
-<i>The message is resonating.</i>


697
00:30:17.499 --> 00:30:22.603
<i>I love the sort of viral,</i>
<i>unorthodox message of,</i>


698
00:30:22.605 --> 00:30:25.239
<i>"We have a rat problem,"</i>
<i>because it gets people talking.</i>


699
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:29.076
And I think it's...
it's a powerful message.


700
00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:31.111
Once you get down to what
the message is,


701
00:30:31.113 --> 00:30:34.047
<i>you feel the trickle</i>
<i>of the message</i>


702
00:30:34.049 --> 00:30:36.049
<i>spreading across this county,</i>

703
00:30:36.051 --> 00:30:37.985
<i>and that's what's gonna</i>
<i>get us the big win.</i>


704
00:30:37.987 --> 00:30:39.519
- woman: No sign now.
- Tim: I understand.


705
00:30:39.521 --> 00:30:42.222
- I apologize.
- woman: Right. Thank you.


706
00:30:45.294 --> 00:30:47.060
Tim: (sighs) Well,
that's a new one.


707
00:30:47.062 --> 00:30:50.497
If there was a real rat problem
in that restaurant,


708
00:30:50.499 --> 00:30:51.732
then it would be appropriate.

709
00:30:51.734 --> 00:30:53.100
And if there isn't
a rat problem,


710
00:30:53.102 --> 00:30:55.302
then they don't have
anything to worry about.


711
00:30:57.139 --> 00:30:58.538
There we go.

712
00:30:58.874 --> 00:31:00.407
Oh, great.

713
00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:01.909
Shit.

714
00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:07.547
Tim:<i>So, what are we doing</i>
<i>with the...</i>


715
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:09.983
<i>I mean, are we...</i>
<i>Do we have anybody coming down?</i>


716
00:31:09.985 --> 00:31:12.786
- I'm working on it. Actually...
- Tim: Okay.


717
00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:13.954
You said you were working on it.

718
00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:16.290
I'm working on it.
CNN... We've got CNN.


719
00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:17.991
- Tim: You have CNN?
- I have them on the line.


720
00:31:17.993 --> 00:31:20.193
- Tim: You have them
on the line?
- It looks good. It looks good.


721
00:31:20.195 --> 00:31:23.096
Good. What's happening
with the GoPro account?


722
00:31:23.098 --> 00:31:24.998
What's GoPro?
Oh, you mean GoFundMe.


723
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.266
- Tim: Mm-hmm.
- It's GoFundMe.


724
00:31:26.268 --> 00:31:27.567
I got it set up.

725
00:31:27.569 --> 00:31:30.304
We have a few dollars.
People donated already.


726
00:31:30.306 --> 00:31:32.272
Tim: Was it linked
to the website?


727
00:31:32.274 --> 00:31:33.340
No, it's not linked.

728
00:31:33.342 --> 00:31:34.741
I don't think we're able
to do that.


729
00:31:34.743 --> 00:31:37.110
The donations are based...
Most of the time, GoFundMe


730
00:31:37.112 --> 00:31:40.480
is set up for people who are,
like, sick or poor or starving.


731
00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:41.915
- (telephone ringing)
- Hold on a sec.


732
00:31:41.917 --> 00:31:43.383
Toni:
I really shouldn't technically


733
00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:45.919
- be doing this, but...
- All right, hold on. Hello?


734
00:31:46.088 --> 00:31:47.988
Yes. Hi.

735
00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:49.423
Oh, good. Great. Thanks.

736
00:31:49.425 --> 00:31:51.992
- Okay. I'll be right down.
- Toni: Wait, wait, wait.


737
00:31:51.994 --> 00:31:54.094
- Who was that?
- It's the front desk.


738
00:31:54.096 --> 00:31:55.862
The hats arrived, so...

739
00:31:55.864 --> 00:31:57.898
- The hats? Oh, careful.
- (clattering)


740
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.766
Toni:<i>I think</i>
<i>it's going pretty well.</i>


741
00:31:59.768 --> 00:32:00.901
<i>I've got GoFundMe.</i>

742
00:32:00.903 --> 00:32:04.671
I'm also... I just set up
a profile for him on IMDb.


743
00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:07.841
Do you know what IMDb is?
It's an actors' website.


744
00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:11.445
Have a gorgeous picture,
a couple of videos of him.


745
00:32:11.447 --> 00:32:15.949
It looks like ABC is interested
in picking up our story.


746
00:32:15.951 --> 00:32:18.719
So I'm gonna
keep on top of that.


747
00:32:18.787 --> 00:32:19.886
I had a connection there,

748
00:32:19.888 --> 00:32:22.089
so I did speak
with that connection,


749
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:23.690
and he referred me
to somebody else.


750
00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:26.860
We're going door to door.
I mean, we're doing everything


751
00:32:26.862 --> 00:32:29.529
- physically possible.
- (knocking)


752
00:32:29.732 --> 00:32:30.464
Oh.

753
00:32:30.466 --> 00:32:31.898
- Is that Tim? Yeah.
- Tim: Toni?


754
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.968
- Hey. I don't have my key.
- Toni: Okay. I'm coming.


755
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.603
Give me a sec.

756
00:32:36.605 --> 00:32:38.872
That was fast. Wow.

757
00:32:39.675 --> 00:32:41.308
- Hi. Yeah. This is it.
- Hi.


758
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.776
How are there 500 hats in here?

759
00:32:42.778 --> 00:32:44.911
Toni: It looks like there
might be five hats in there.


760
00:32:44.913 --> 00:32:47.581
- Toni: Who ordered the hats?
- Tim: You ordered the hats.


761
00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:50.650
I don't remember
ordering five hats.


762
00:32:50.652 --> 00:32:55.422
(clears throat) Yep.
There's one, two, three hats.


763
00:32:55.424 --> 00:32:56.490
There's not even...

764
00:32:56.492 --> 00:32:58.091
- There's three hats.
- I'll have to call them.


765
00:32:58.093 --> 00:33:00.027
Let me put it on my list.
Hold on.


766
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:02.462
'Cause I think we paid
for those, yeah?


767
00:33:02.464 --> 00:33:04.297
I'll make a call.
I'll send an email,


768
00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:06.433
and then I'll follow up
with a phone call.


769
00:33:06.435 --> 00:33:08.735
Very nice. (clears throat)

770
00:33:09.104 --> 00:33:10.337
Tim: Here.

771
00:33:13.275 --> 00:33:15.075
Toni: Yeah,
it's really nice, Tim.


772
00:33:15.077 --> 00:33:17.277
Mm-hmm. Put it on.

773
00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.013
Oh.

774
00:33:21.283 --> 00:33:22.749
(sighs)

775
00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:27.921
Yeah, it's nice.
Yeah, I like it.


776
00:33:28.757 --> 00:33:30.290
- Really nice.
- Tim: Figure out this...


777
00:33:30.292 --> 00:33:32.159
- Toni: Yeah, I'll take care
of it right now.
- There's no point


778
00:33:32.161 --> 00:33:34.127
in five... three fucking hats.

779
00:33:34.129 --> 00:33:36.596
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.


780
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:39.699
- (clattering)
- I just...


781
00:33:40.636 --> 00:33:43.203
(clattering)

782
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.211
Point of three hats are,
one for me, you,


783
00:33:51.213 --> 00:33:53.313
and the volunteer we don't have.

784
00:33:56.318 --> 00:33:57.884
Toni: Tim, there's wine
in the other room.


785
00:33:57.886 --> 00:33:59.686
- Why don't you have a glass?
- Tim: I might have a glass.


786
00:33:59.688 --> 00:34:02.255
Toni: It might calm you down
a little bit.


787
00:34:02.624 --> 00:34:04.257
(door closes)

788
00:34:08.864 --> 00:34:10.630
(watch chimes)

789
00:34:14.636 --> 00:34:17.504
All right,
let's pound some pavement.


790
00:34:24.746 --> 00:34:26.746
- Tim: Hello.
- man: How you doing?


791
00:34:26.748 --> 00:34:28.381
Tim: Good. How are you guys?

792
00:34:28.383 --> 00:34:32.419
¶ (rap music playing) ¶

793
00:34:32.521 --> 00:34:34.488
So, you getting a haircut?

794
00:34:35.624 --> 00:34:36.456
Cool.

795
00:34:36.458 --> 00:34:39.960
Are you a registered voter here
in San Bernardino?


796
00:34:39.962 --> 00:34:40.961
- Yeah.
- Cool.


797
00:34:40.963 --> 00:34:43.964
I want to eliminate crime
from the entire region...


798
00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:46.500
and basically have
a zero-tolerance policy


799
00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:49.703
for anybody that breaks the law.
I mean, it's not that...


800
00:34:49.705 --> 00:34:51.104
I don't want to disrupt
your, uh,


801
00:34:51.106 --> 00:34:52.839
- concentration there.
- No, you're fine, you're fine.


802
00:34:52.841 --> 00:34:57.844
I'd probably not be
so kind on people...


803
00:34:57.846 --> 00:34:58.879
no offense to you guys,

804
00:34:58.881 --> 00:35:00.680
but listening
to that kind of music.


805
00:35:00.682 --> 00:35:03.850
I'd put a clamp down
on that kind of stuff...


806
00:35:04.419 --> 00:35:07.587
just 'cause it's so...
you know, encourages violence.


807
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:09.956
You know, sort of taking
San Bernardino


808
00:35:09.958 --> 00:35:11.858
back to the good old days.

809
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.261
Okay. I hear that.
Curtain down on E Street?


810
00:35:14.263 --> 00:35:15.495
That's right.

811
00:35:15.497 --> 00:35:17.264
man:

812
00:35:17.266 --> 00:35:18.798
Well... (laughs)

813
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.467
...I know what you mean by that.

814
00:35:20.469 --> 00:35:23.503
But it's complicated.

815
00:35:23.939 --> 00:35:25.672
Things are changing.

816
00:35:27.009 --> 00:35:28.041
All right?

817
00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:30.644
- (bell chimes)
- Tim: Hello.


818
00:35:30.846 --> 00:35:32.479
Running for District Attorney.

819
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.680
Sorry. I do not mean to solicit.

820
00:35:33.682 --> 00:35:38.318
I'm just... free speech,
First Amendment, ability to...


821
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.387
woman:

822
00:35:40.389 --> 00:35:42.522
- I'm sorry?
- woman:


823
00:35:42.524 --> 00:35:43.790
I do have permission. I have...

824
00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:46.159
From the county,
I have permission.


825
00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:48.461
I have permission
from the First Amendment.


826
00:35:48.463 --> 00:35:50.730
Look it up.
It's the Constitution.


827
00:35:51.667 --> 00:35:55.402
I have a First Amendment right
in the Constitution.


828
00:35:55.971 --> 00:36:00.040
I'm not filming you.
Get over yourself.


829
00:36:03.212 --> 00:36:06.213
woman:

830
00:36:09.351 --> 00:36:11.351
You'll vote for me!

833
00:36:15.023 --> 00:36:16.590

- Toni:<i>...then "play."</i>


834
00:36:16.592 --> 00:36:18.425
<i>Okay. Got it. Okay.</i>

835
00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:22.062
Okay.

836
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.132
Tim: No.

837
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.807
- Toni: What?
- (Tim sighs)


838
00:36:33.809 --> 00:36:35.375
Press play.

839
00:36:35.377 --> 00:36:36.843
- Press pl...
- There we go. I got it.

"I am District Attorney

857
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:16.383
- That sucks.
- What the hell?


858
00:37:16.385 --> 00:37:17.951
I don't know.
Is it a good thing or not?


859
00:37:17.953 --> 00:37:19.619
- I don't know.
- I... I don't...


860
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:20.854
We don't want negative press,

861
00:37:20.856 --> 00:37:23.923
but, you know, you want
an acknowledgement that there's,


862
00:37:23.925 --> 00:37:25.392
that we're in
the arena together.


863
00:37:25.394 --> 00:37:28.061
But any press is good press.
You know what I'm saying?


864
00:37:28.063 --> 00:37:29.329
There's no press for us.

865
00:37:29.331 --> 00:37:32.132
We should put out a statement
about that at least.


866
00:37:32.134 --> 00:37:33.600
Yeah, I'm gonna...
As soon as I get...


867
00:37:33.602 --> 00:37:36.836
Put out a press release from me,
basically...


868
00:37:36.838 --> 00:37:40.640
- (exhales)
- Get this... get this down.


869
00:37:40.642 --> 00:37:41.775
You want the computer off?

870
00:37:41.777 --> 00:37:43.710
No, I'm saying put the...
write this down.


871
00:37:43.712 --> 00:37:45.412
All right, well, do you
have some suggestions?


872
00:37:45.414 --> 00:37:46.913
- What are you...
- I'm telling you


873
00:37:46.915 --> 00:37:48.915
- I want to send
a press release out, so...
- Okay.


874
00:37:48.917 --> 00:37:51.751
All right. Will do.

875
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:55.922
Tim: All right, ready?

876
00:37:55.924 --> 00:37:58.892
Get a Word document open
or something.


877
00:37:58.894 --> 00:37:59.926
Do you not have Word?

878
00:37:59.928 --> 00:38:02.295
Toni: I don't know where
it is on this.


879
00:38:02.297 --> 00:38:04.064
Let me see. Hold on.

880
00:38:04.433 --> 00:38:06.833
That's to open the files.

881
00:38:08.437 --> 00:38:09.369
(computer dings)

882
00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:11.604
You should have sent this to me
on my computer.


883
00:38:11.606 --> 00:38:15.742
- Write it on your notepad or...
- Oh, here, we got it.


884
00:38:15.744 --> 00:38:18.678
Okay. Documents. Geez!

885
00:38:19.014 --> 00:38:20.347
- Here.
- I'm losing my train


886
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:22.682
of thought here.
Just make a note.


887
00:38:24.252 --> 00:38:26.853
"To whom it may concern...

888
00:38:27.089 --> 00:38:30.957

the Vincent Rosetti attack ad."


889
00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:33.059
- "Rebuttal."
- No. I...


890
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:35.695
I got it. "Vincent Rosetti."

891
00:38:36.098 --> 00:38:41.501
"I have recently viewed
the Vincent Rosetti attack ad...


892
00:38:42.604 --> 00:38:45.672

893
00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:48.041
whatever, a...

894
00:38:48.677 --> 00:38:50.343
Yeah, but it wasn't an attack
against you.


895
00:38:50.345 --> 00:38:52.412
- You weren't even in there.
- No, I know,
but it was an offic...


896
00:38:52.414 --> 00:38:54.147
It was an... It was an attack
against Sandoval.


897
00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:58.051
How about this?
"The recent Rosetti..."


898
00:38:59.721 --> 00:39:00.987
"The recent Rosetti..."

899
00:39:00.989 --> 00:39:03.156
Write that down,
"The recent Rosetti."


900
00:39:03.158 --> 00:39:04.190
What are you doing?

901
00:39:04.192 --> 00:39:06.426
You know what I think
we should do, honestly?


902
00:39:06.428 --> 00:39:10.463
I think that we should leave
Sandoval out of it completely.


903
00:39:10.465 --> 00:39:13.133
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- Yeah. And just go after...


904
00:39:13.135 --> 00:39:17.003
- Listen, just write what I'm...
- Go ahead. I'm listening.


905
00:39:17.005 --> 00:39:22.942
"The recent Rosetti ad
that I saw on YouTube is so...


906
00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:26.513
is dishonest, even for him."

907
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.015
(burps)

908
00:39:29.017 --> 00:39:32.452
"Now that the race
is tightening"...


909
00:39:33.588 --> 00:39:36.122
"Now that the race
is tightening...


910
00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:41.928
we see the rat beginning
to scow... beginning to cower."


911
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:43.630
Mm-hmm.

912
00:39:44.866 --> 00:39:46.466
Anything else?

913
00:39:47.335 --> 00:39:48.401
No. I mean, all the...

914
00:39:48.403 --> 00:39:49.869
"Visit the website"
and all that crap.


915
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:51.771
- But we need to get our own ad.
- Yeah. We will.


916
00:39:51.773 --> 00:39:54.607
And we need to get a film crew
down here.


917
00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:56.142
I mean, these guys could do it,
but they say


918
00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:58.578
they're not gonna do it.
I've asked them 20 times.


919
00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.813
Why can't they do it?

920
00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:02.816
- They've got cameras.
- They say it's impartial
journalism or some shit.


921
00:40:02.818 --> 00:40:04.017
I mean, he's scared, right?

922
00:40:04.019 --> 00:40:06.920
That's what I...
That's what it's about.


923
00:40:06.922 --> 00:40:07.887
He's scared.

924
00:40:07.889 --> 00:40:12.792
He doesn't want to mention me
in the ad because he's so...


925
00:40:12.794 --> 00:40:14.093
Toni: Oh!

926
00:40:14.529 --> 00:40:21.234
So nervous about the mere
mention of my name than...


927
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:23.303
He's so...

928
00:40:23.305 --> 00:40:25.505
Here, let me get
a napkin for you.


929
00:40:25.507 --> 00:40:28.508
- Where are the napkins here?
- Tim: "He's so scared."


930
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.376
- Viral campaign that's...
- Toni: Here you go.


931
00:40:30.378 --> 00:40:31.711
- There you go.
- Tim: Thank you.


932
00:40:31.713 --> 00:40:33.780
- You're welcome.
- Tim: That's gotten...


933
00:40:34.082 --> 00:40:36.082
Oh, it's on the floor.

934
00:40:36.084 --> 00:40:37.484
Toni: I'm listening to you.
Go ahead.


935
00:40:37.486 --> 00:40:40.053
Tim: I'm saying, so, there is...

936
00:40:40.288 --> 00:40:41.488
If he brings my name, people go,

937
00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.590
"Oh, that's the guy
with the 'rat problem' sign."


938
00:40:43.592 --> 00:40:44.624
We can ignore the ad.

939
00:40:44.626 --> 00:40:46.125
We don't have to directly talk

940
00:40:46.127 --> 00:40:47.494
- about the ad.
- The ad is crap.


941
00:40:47.496 --> 00:40:49.662
The ad is terrible anyway,
so it doesn't matter.


942
00:40:49.664 --> 00:40:50.930
Let's just not focus on that.

943
00:40:50.932 --> 00:40:52.799
- Let's just focus on us.
- I'm not worried about it.


944
00:40:52.801 --> 00:40:54.734
- I'm not worried
about it, actually.
- Toni: Are you sure?


945
00:40:54.736 --> 00:40:56.202
Because it seems
to bother you a lot.


946
00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:57.103
Absolutely not.

947
00:40:57.105 --> 00:40:58.671
Should we report that,
though, because...


948
00:40:58.673 --> 00:41:01.274
- report that to YouTube.
- Toni: I don't think you can.


949
00:41:01.276 --> 00:41:02.575
I think he paid for it legally.

950
00:41:02.577 --> 00:41:04.677
- I understand,
but there's factual in...
- Toni: You can't report it.


951
00:41:04.679 --> 00:41:05.879
inaccuracies in there.

952
00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:07.514
It is what it is.
It's out there.


953
00:41:07.516 --> 00:41:09.582
- We, you know...
- Toni: Yeah.


954
00:41:09.584 --> 00:41:10.817
Our preference would be that...

955
00:41:10.819 --> 00:41:12.919
I think our preference is
that we're mentioned in there


956
00:41:12.921 --> 00:41:15.288
because that at least provides
a little contrast.


957
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.090
Toni: That we are?
We're not mentioned.


958
00:41:17.092 --> 00:41:18.491
- It's good.
- I know, but I'm saying


959
00:41:18.493 --> 00:41:20.960
we should... it would be better,
but it's not there.


960
00:41:20.962 --> 00:41:22.061
That's the reality.

961
00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:26.566
Um, you know, we have to just
look at tomorrow as a new day


962
00:41:26.568 --> 00:41:31.037
and do... you know,
get our to-do list going again


963
00:41:31.039 --> 00:41:33.673
and... (burps)

964
00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:36.576
...you know...

965
00:41:37.946 --> 00:41:39.846
- Okay.
- Okay.


966
00:41:40.715 --> 00:41:42.415
(Toni sighs)

967
00:41:43.685 --> 00:41:46.553
- (computer dings)
- (Toni clears throat)


968
00:41:47.322 --> 00:41:50.924
- (computer dings)
- (Toni sighs)


969
00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:55.261
- (keyboard clacking)
- (computer dings)


970
00:41:57.499 --> 00:41:58.898
Toni: That's it. Okay.

971
00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.867
- (keyboard clacking)
- (computer dings)


972
00:42:00.869 --> 00:42:04.871
- Toni: Yeah. Yeah.
- (dialer tone ringing)


973
00:42:25.594 --> 00:42:27.727
(engaged dial tone)

974
00:42:27.729 --> 00:42:29.028

You know, this is where I'm at

987
00:43:03.932 --> 00:43:06.132
with the petition
for the ballot.


988
00:43:06.134 --> 00:43:09.602
And it's not... I know
it's not what you want to see.


989
00:43:09.604 --> 00:43:11.204
- Um...
- Toni: Oh, my God, Tim.


990
00:43:11.206 --> 00:43:14.040
Yeah, I mean, well, we have...
add 30 from the website,


991
00:43:14.042 --> 00:43:18.745
from the petition we put up
on the Internet, but, um...


992
00:43:18.747 --> 00:43:21.414
Tim, this is not gonna cut it.

993
00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:23.383
This is not gonna get us
on the ballot.


994
00:43:23.385 --> 00:43:25.051
- You realize that.
- Tim: I understand. I know.


995
00:43:25.053 --> 00:43:26.919
We're hundreds away,
hundreds of signatures away.


996
00:43:26.921 --> 00:43:29.555
- Hundreds and hundreds away.
- Tim: I know.


997
00:43:29.557 --> 00:43:31.557
Toni: I think we need to sit
and strategize


998
00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:32.592
about this right now.

999
00:43:32.594 --> 00:43:34.360
- Okay.
- Do you think it'd be possible


1000
00:43:34.362 --> 00:43:36.529
that we could have
a little privacy, um,


1001
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:40.166
just a little alone time
so that Tim and I can just...


1002
00:43:40.168 --> 00:43:42.502
Tim: Josh, I think probably
a good idea


1003
00:43:42.504 --> 00:43:44.904
to maybe
take a five-minute break.


1004
00:43:44.906 --> 00:43:46.539
Toni: If you don't mind,
just so we can have


1005
00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:48.708
- a few moments
to kind of reset.
- Yeah. We're getting into some


1006
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.842
sensitive territory here.

1007
00:43:49.844 --> 00:43:51.678
- Josh: Sure. Yeah, you guys...
- Toni: Yeah.


1008
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.813
Tim: She's been... Yeah,
she's a little uncomfortable


1009
00:43:53.815 --> 00:43:55.415
about being on camera.

1010
00:43:55.417 --> 00:43:56.749
- Toni: Yeah.
- Tim: You know?


1011
00:43:56.751 --> 00:43:59.052
- Tim: Thanks. Thanks, guys.
- Toni: We really appreciate it.


1012
00:43:59.054 --> 00:44:00.687
Tim: And we have a...
You know, if you want


1013
00:44:00.689 --> 00:44:02.522
to get something down
at the snack bar or anything,


1014
00:44:02.524 --> 00:44:05.958
you can just put it
on the room, all right?


1015
00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:09.495
- (door closes)
- They're gonna check
the address.


1016
00:44:09.497 --> 00:44:10.897
They're not gonna check
the address.


1017
00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:13.099
That was my point, that this is
all just a formality.


1018
00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:14.834
- So let's just get into it.
- All right.


1019
00:44:14.836 --> 00:44:18.471
John, uh... It doesn't matter.
John...


1020
00:44:18.473 --> 00:44:20.440
- Trevor.
- ...Grover.


1021
00:44:20.508 --> 00:44:21.407
Trevor Smith.

1022
00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:23.676
- Peter...
- That's really close,


1023
00:44:23.678 --> 00:44:25.344
so you're gonna need
to mix it up a little bit.


1024
00:44:25.346 --> 00:44:27.947
Yeah, I'll change...
Why don't we change pens...


1025
00:44:27.949 --> 00:44:29.716
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- ...kind of randomly?


1026
00:44:29.718 --> 00:44:32.452
Toni: So, look.
You see how I varied everything?


1027
00:44:32.454 --> 00:44:33.386
Tim: Mm-hmm.

1028
00:44:33.388 --> 00:44:35.888
- So you got a Trevor Smith.
- Tim: Put this...


1029
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:38.324
Yeah, but why don't I do...
I'll do some on here.


1030
00:44:38.326 --> 00:44:41.260
- Toni: All right.
- Tim: And, um...


1031
00:44:41.696 --> 00:44:44.564
Amy... Masters.

1032
00:44:44.566 --> 00:44:46.332
- (Toni laughs) There you go.
- (Tim laughs)


1033
00:44:46.334 --> 00:44:47.767
Tim: You do one,
and then I'll do one.


1034
00:44:47.769 --> 00:44:52.305
- Perfect.
- Jason... Davidson.


1035
00:44:52.574 --> 00:44:53.606
How about Johnny Mathis?

1036
00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:56.442
- (Toni laughs)
- Johnny Mathis. Tom Cruise.


1037
00:44:56.444 --> 00:44:58.478
- I'll make it Tom Cruise Jr.
- Oh, I'd like


1038
00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.580
to make it Tom Cruise.

1039
00:45:00.582 --> 00:45:01.848
What's the camera guy's name?

1040
00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.083
- Vincent Price, huh?
- (laughs) No, don't do that.


1041
00:45:04.085 --> 00:45:05.651
No? Why not? Who cares?

1042
00:45:05.653 --> 00:45:06.753
I mean, it's all guys.

1043
00:45:06.755 --> 00:45:08.354
- That's my problem.
- Do you have any siblings?


1044
00:45:08.356 --> 00:45:10.957
Uh, no. I did,
but she's passed away.


1045
00:45:10.959 --> 00:45:13.059
- She passed away
a couple years ago.
- I'll put my


1046
00:45:13.061 --> 00:45:14.127
sister's name down.

1047
00:45:14.129 --> 00:45:17.897
Joe Estevez. He would have
signed it. He's a friend.


1048
00:45:17.966 --> 00:45:20.433
All right, good.
And now that's one, two...


1049
00:45:20.435 --> 00:45:21.334
that's 20.

1050

Oh, my God, this is gonna
take us all night.


1051
00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:24.604
- All right.
- Oh, my God.


1052
00:45:24.606 --> 00:45:26.706
- (Tim burps)
- You better grab another beer.


1053
00:45:26.708 --> 00:45:28.274
Another bottle of wine
for me, too.


1054
00:45:28.276 --> 00:45:29.809
Where's the wine?

1055
00:45:31.579 --> 00:45:35.114
Here you go, baby.
It's all good.


1056
00:45:35.183 --> 00:45:36.015
Awesome.

I don't know how
I'm gonna not physically


1065
00:45:55.603 --> 00:45:58.437
uh, assault this motherfucker
when I see him.


1066
00:45:58.439 --> 00:45:59.605
I have to hold back.

1067
00:45:59.607 --> 00:46:01.307
I mean, I'm getting
my adrenaline up,


1068
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:04.076
but, you know, I'm...
Listen, I'm gonna go to him


1069
00:46:04.078 --> 00:46:05.711
straight up to his face and say,

1070
00:46:05.713 --> 00:46:08.080
"Motherfucker, you are
meeting me in the arena."


1071
00:46:08.082 --> 00:46:09.749
I don't know. I don't know how
to predict it.


1072
00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:10.983
I think he might take the bait.

1073
00:46:10.985 --> 00:46:13.753
I think he might step right into
my trap and actually show up...


1074
00:46:13.755 --> 00:46:17.356
We hope he does, 'cause I think
we should hear from him.


1075
00:46:17.358 --> 00:46:18.624
He has to answer for his crimes.

I got to stop for a second.
I can't see anything.

I'm gonna fucking punch him.

waiting for Rosetti the Rat
to emerge.

I'm gonna confront him

00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:34.734
and invite him into the arena

going tomorrow night.

All right, we are...
It's been 20 minutes, and uh...


1104
00:47:47.982 --> 00:47:51.717
There he is. All right,
here we go. We're going live.

Hey, Vincent! Rosetti!

1106
00:47:54.155 --> 00:47:56.522
How you doing?
It's Tim Heidecker.


1107
00:47:56.524 --> 00:47:58.057
How come you
haven't called back?


1108
00:47:58.059 --> 00:47:59.125
We've left you messages.

1109
00:47:59.127 --> 00:48:01.494
We're challenging you
to a debate tomorrow night


1110
00:48:01.496 --> 00:48:04.764
at the Lincoln Suites downtown.

1111
00:48:04.933 --> 00:48:05.965
You should join us.

1112
00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:07.333
I'd love to talk to you
about the issues.


1113
00:48:07.335 --> 00:48:08.801
You have anything to say?

1114
00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:10.403
You can't be serious, Heidecker.

1115
00:48:10.405 --> 00:48:11.370
No, I am serious.

1116
00:48:11.372 --> 00:48:12.872
Why don't you want
to debate me, rat?


1117
00:48:12.874 --> 00:48:14.640
- You're a clown, Heidecker.
<i>-</i> You're a clown.


1118
00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:16.175
Oh, I'd rather be a clown
than a rat.


1119
00:48:16.177 --> 00:48:17.977
- I don't have time for this.
- Tim: You don't have time.


1120
00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:20.012
- This conversation is over.
- Tim: Okay.


1121
00:48:20.014 --> 00:48:21.514
- Thank you.
- Get out of my way, please.


1122
00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:23.883
How come you couldn't beat me
in court?


1123
00:48:23.885 --> 00:48:25.051
What kind of DA is that?

1124
00:48:25.053 --> 00:48:29.655
- First time in a courtroom me,
first time... Oh!
- (car horn honking)


1125
00:48:29.757 --> 00:48:31.657
Folks, Vincent Rosetti,

1126
00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:33.459
District Attorney
of San Bernardino,


1127
00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:34.560
is trying to kill me.

1128
00:48:34.562 --> 00:48:36.162
It's attempted murder
happening right here


1129
00:48:36.164 --> 00:48:40.099
in front of the DA's office,
with his Honda piece of shit...


1130
00:48:40.101 --> 00:48:43.102
Hey! Are you... Fuck you!

1131
00:48:43.104 --> 00:48:45.404
Yeah. Oh, I got that on tape,
scumbag.


1132
00:48:45.406 --> 00:48:50.142
I got your license plate.

1133
00:48:50.144 --> 00:48:53.946
<i>That is... Vincent Rosetti</i>
<i>just tried to kill me</i>
<i>on camera.</i>


1134
00:48:53.948 --> 00:48:57.516
<i>We have it on camera.</i>
<i>He refuses to debate me.</i>


1135
00:48:57.518 --> 00:48:59.885
Woo! That was awesome.
You guys get that?


1136
00:48:59.887 --> 00:49:03.589
I think Tim's running for DA
because he's just angry


1137
00:49:03.591 --> 00:49:06.792
because Rosetti
did a really good job.


1138
00:49:06.794 --> 00:49:08.894
<i>The case didn't go the way</i>
<i>Rosetti wanted,</i>


1139
00:49:08.896 --> 00:49:10.629
<i>but to the people</i>
<i>that watched it,</i>


1140
00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:14.400
<i>Tim was very, very guilty</i>
<i>and looked like a real fool.</i>


1141
00:49:14.402 --> 00:49:17.303
He just always wants
to get revenge against anybody.


1142
00:49:17.305 --> 00:49:19.305
Like, for instance,
I got free tickets


1143
00:49:19.307 --> 00:49:22.141
to the<i>Sully</i> premiere...
not even the premiere,


1144
00:49:22.143 --> 00:49:24.877
but the pre-premiere,
like the critics screenings.


1145
00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:27.613
He was jealous 'cause he was
probably passed out


1146
00:49:27.615 --> 00:49:29.215
somewhere in his vape den.

1147
00:49:29.217 --> 00:49:31.550
And then I'm telling everyone,
"Oh,<i>Sully</i> is great.


1148
00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:34.553
This is the film of the year.
This is gonna win Oscars."


1149
00:49:34.555 --> 00:49:36.555
And he's like, "What's<i>Sully?"</i>

1150
00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:38.624
I think if you point it back
at him


1151
00:49:38.626 --> 00:49:39.759
with a lot of these things,

1152
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:41.327
turn it around
and point it at him,


1153
00:49:41.329 --> 00:49:42.661
and you'll find out the truth.

1154
00:49:42.663 --> 00:49:45.631
I saw it in the first group
of 300 people


1155
00:49:45.633 --> 00:49:46.732
ever to see<i>Sully.</i>

<i>it's starting to feel real.</i>


1175
00:50:34.415 --> 00:50:36.782
<i>I'm not nervous.</i>
<i>I just feel a sense</i>


1176
00:50:36.784 --> 00:50:38.818
<i>of obligation to the community</i>

1177

<i>that I'm doing this</i>
<i>for the right reasons.</i>


1178
00:50:41.923 --> 00:50:45.357
There's
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr...


1179
00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:50.629
poster... a statue of him,
one of the founding fathers.


1180
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:53.399
Uh, you know, just one
of the people I look up to


1181
00:50:53.401 --> 00:50:58.137
and I'm always quoting
and using his message


1182
00:50:58.139 --> 00:51:02.174
to get me through, you know,
what I'm going through.


1183
00:51:02.176 --> 00:51:04.243
One of the great citizens
of San Bernardino and...


1184
00:51:04.245 --> 00:51:06.812
was one of the greats.
Unfortunately, he passed.


1185
00:51:06.814 --> 00:51:10.850
But we are always remembering
his words and deeds.


1186
00:51:10.852 --> 00:51:13.752
So, I'm gonna go pay homage
to him privately.

00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:32.605
<i>obviously I'll be at</i>
<i>the District Attorney's office,</i>


1193
00:51:32.607 --> 00:51:35.374
but I'm sure I'll be scrambling
to and fro,


1194
00:51:35.376 --> 00:51:38.978
visiting City Hall,
chiming in on new laws.


1195
00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.546
I'm sure I will stop each time

1196
00:51:40.548 --> 00:51:42.581
and pay my respects
to this beautiful fountain,


1197
00:51:42.583 --> 00:51:46.452
this rushing water,
reminiscent of the Rio Grande


1198
00:51:46.454 --> 00:51:47.586
or the great Mississippi

1199
00:51:47.588 --> 00:51:49.655
or any of the rivers
of our great country,


1200
00:51:49.657 --> 00:51:52.057
and pausing to reflect
on the message


1201
00:51:52.059 --> 00:51:53.392
of Dr. Martin Luther King.

1202
00:51:53.394 --> 00:51:57.897
It's fitting that San Bernardino
has such a monument here,


1203
00:51:57.899 --> 00:52:02.635
and I'm glad we got to spend
some time enjoying it together.


1204
00:52:02.637 --> 00:52:05.871
Josh, if you want to get
your picture taken with it.


1205
00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:10.943
Gregg: Hey, guys.

1206
00:52:10.945 --> 00:52:13.612
<i>Josh.</i>
<i>What are you guys shooting?</i>


1207
00:52:13.714 --> 00:52:15.948
Josh: Uh, just some B-roll.

1208
00:52:16.317 --> 00:52:19.451
A lot of cool movies
shot in San Bernardino.


1209
00:52:19.453 --> 00:52:20.386
You know<i>Congo?</i>

1210
00:52:20.388 --> 00:52:22.087
You'll never guess
where that was shot.


1211
00:52:22.089 --> 00:52:24.557
They actually shot
the airport scenes right here


1212
00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:26.825
at the San Bernardino Airport...

1213
00:52:26.827 --> 00:52:29.562
- Josh: I didn't know that.
- ...not in the Congo.


1214
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:30.596
Kind of cool.

1215
00:52:30.598 --> 00:52:33.299
<i>Independence Day,</i> too,
they shot in Fontana.


1216
00:52:33.301 --> 00:52:36.402
Josh: Sorry I didn't, uh...
I got your messages.


1217
00:52:36.404 --> 00:52:38.771
Yeah. Um,
I wanted to talk to you


1218
00:52:38.773 --> 00:52:41.106
about this<i>Shaggy DA</i> thing,
and then, also,


1219
00:52:41.108 --> 00:52:42.608
I had this idea...

1220
00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:45.978
and if you guys are into it,
we go to a Baskin-Robbins


1221
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.681
and shoot me coming out
of the Baskin-Robbins...


1222
00:52:48.683 --> 00:52:49.949
- Josh: Oh.
- ...sort of like


1223
00:52:49.951 --> 00:52:51.450
as the character
from<i>Ant-Man...</i>


1224
00:52:51.452 --> 00:52:52.885
- Josh: Mm-hmm.
- ...just coming out


1225
00:52:52.887 --> 00:52:56.188
of the thing. And then I can
talk to you guys or whatever,


1226
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:57.089
be in character.

1227
00:52:57.091 --> 00:52:58.757
Josh: Yeah. I don't know
if we can do that today.


1228
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:00.659
- Maybe, um...
- There's a Baskin-Robbins.


1229
00:53:00.661 --> 00:53:03.963
I checked. It's about a mile
from here, on 5th.


1230
00:53:03.965 --> 00:53:06.232
Josh: We got a lot of stuff
we got to cover today.


1231
00:53:06.234 --> 00:53:07.933
We're meeting back up with Tim
in a little bit.


1232
00:53:07.935 --> 00:53:10.102
Well, you've got enough of him,
I'm sure.


1233
00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:11.537
We've actually
got to get going now.


1234
00:53:11.539 --> 00:53:13.706
We have a couple other spots
we have to hit up.


1235
00:53:13.708 --> 00:53:16.875
- But it was nice
running into you.
- Okay, well, I'll come along.


1236
00:53:16.877 --> 00:53:18.444
Josh: That's okay.

1237
00:53:37.632 --> 00:53:40.466
- Manuel:<i>How are you, man?</i>
- Tim:<i>Hey, man.</i>


1238
00:53:40.468 --> 00:53:42.434
I'm fucking tired.

1239
00:53:42.436 --> 00:53:44.403
- What time is it there, man?
- Manuel:<i>How are you, man?</i>


1240
00:53:44.405 --> 00:53:45.604
<i>So good to hear from you.</i>

1241
00:53:45.606 --> 00:53:48.474
Yeah. Good to hear from you,
man. It's...


1242
00:53:48.976 --> 00:53:50.309
- What?
- Manuel:<i>It's 4:20</i>


1243
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:52.544
<i>in the morning.</i>
<i>4:20 in the morning.</i>


1244
00:53:52.546 --> 00:53:54.747
You're probably up partying.

1245
00:53:55.116 --> 00:53:57.916
<i>You know, Manuel has...</i>

1246
00:53:57.918 --> 00:54:00.586
<i>Because of what happened</i>
<i>with him at the trial,</i>


1247
00:54:00.588 --> 00:54:02.921
<i>he's essentially back in Italy.</i>

1248
00:54:02.923 --> 00:54:08.027
"I, Dr. San, am only one
responsible for all the death


1249
00:54:08.029 --> 00:54:10.429
from the Electric Sun 20.

1250
00:54:10.431 --> 00:54:11.797
It is all my fault."

1251
00:54:11.799 --> 00:54:14.033
You took an oath,
and you swore before God


1252
00:54:14.035 --> 00:54:16.402
- that you would tell the truth.
- Come on.


1253
00:54:16.404 --> 00:54:18.837
I'm gonna ask you now
one more time.


1254
00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:20.472
Who wrote the letter?

1255
00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:22.741
- Tim gave it to me
this morning.
- Vincent: Okay.


1256
00:54:22.743 --> 00:54:24.176
He talks like
they're his friends


1257
00:54:24.178 --> 00:54:26.145
and says they're his rock
and all this stuff,


1258
00:54:26.147 --> 00:54:29.381
but those guys, believe me,
the minute he doesn't pay them,


1259
00:54:29.383 --> 00:54:30.683
<i>you don't see them around.</i>

1260
00:54:30.685 --> 00:54:32.284
<i>They're gone for long periods</i>
<i>of time.</i>


1261
00:54:32.286 --> 00:54:34.920
<i>And then he gets a little bit</i>
<i>of money through some scam,</i>


1262
00:54:34.922 --> 00:54:36.889
<i>and then suddenly,</i>
<i>there's Axiom, Manuel,</i>


1263
00:54:36.891 --> 00:54:39.224
and they're doing
recordings again.


1264
00:54:39.226 --> 00:54:42.661
You are so worried
about this perjury shit


1265
00:54:42.663 --> 00:54:43.896
from the trial, that...

1266
00:54:43.898 --> 00:54:46.665
it is not something
that they're gonna follow up on


1267
00:54:46.667 --> 00:54:47.833
because when you get back here,

1268
00:54:47.835 --> 00:54:50.202
I'm gonna be in charge
of that shit.


1269
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:52.137
You know what I mean?

1270
00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:53.706
Manuel:

1271
00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:58.143
And Axiom's not calling me back,
and he's being, you know...


1272
00:54:58.145 --> 00:55:03.449
like suddenly creating a wall
that I don't understand.


1273
00:55:03.684 --> 00:55:04.717
Hold on, Manuel.

1274
00:55:04.719 --> 00:55:06.218
- Toni!
- Toni: Yeah?


1275
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.587
Can you get another one
of these, please?


1276
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:10.689
- Toni: Uh, sure.
- Thanks.


1277
00:55:12.593 --> 00:55:14.460
I'm sorry.
I'm doing this campaign,


1278
00:55:14.462 --> 00:55:19.431
and we're, like, trying to get
this town hall thing going.


1279
00:55:19.433 --> 00:55:20.933
It's like... It's not as easy

1280
00:55:20.935 --> 00:55:23.035
as just going down
and playing a show.


1281
00:55:23.037 --> 00:55:25.504
- And I'm doing this...
- Manuel:


1282
00:55:25.506 --> 00:55:29.007
I'm doing this
with this woman who's...


1283
00:55:29.009 --> 00:55:31.477
- What is it?
- We need to talk.


1284
00:55:31.479 --> 00:55:32.978
- Okay.
- So?


1285
00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.113
- Right now?
- Yeah.


1286
00:55:34.115 --> 00:55:35.514
- Okay. Hold on.
- Come on out.


1287
00:55:35.516 --> 00:55:37.583
- Get off the phone
and come out and talk.
- I can't get out. Hold on.


1288
00:55:37.585 --> 00:55:39.251
Manuel, baby, I got
to call you back, man.


1289
00:55:39.253 --> 00:55:43.389
Keep rocking, and I love you,
and we'll talk soon.


1290
00:55:44.125 --> 00:55:46.558
- Manuel:
- Cheers.


1291
00:55:46.827 --> 00:55:48.427
Ciao.

1292
00:55:48.729 --> 00:55:51.430
- What's up?
- Well...


1293
00:55:51.532 --> 00:55:54.233
- I sort of have some bad news.
- Okay.


1294
00:55:54.235 --> 00:55:56.602
I had all of these guys
in the loop,


1295
00:55:56.604 --> 00:55:59.605
and they've all pretty much
just dropped out.


1296
00:55:59.607 --> 00:56:00.672
Tim: Mm-hmm.

1297
00:56:00.674 --> 00:56:02.708
I mean, everything
was in a pending mode.


1298
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:04.710
I can't even get<i>The Sun</i>
to come.


1299
00:56:04.712 --> 00:56:06.211
- What do you mean?
- I can't even get


1300
00:56:06.213 --> 00:56:07.913
- the<i>San Bernardino Sun.</i>
- They're not com...


1301
00:56:07.915 --> 00:56:09.448
- They're not...
- They're not coming, Tim.


1302
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.617
- They said they're not coming?
- They said they're not coming.


1303
00:56:11.619 --> 00:56:13.218
Why wouldn't they come?
It's a...


1304
00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:16.321
- it's an official campaign.
- I know. I unders...


1305
00:56:16.323 --> 00:56:17.489
You're telling me they're not...

1306
00:56:17.491 --> 00:56:18.991
they've confirmed to you
that they're not coming?


1307
00:56:18.993 --> 00:56:21.326
They've confirmed
that they're not coming.


1308
00:56:21.328 --> 00:56:22.494
- Ugh!
- They actually sent me


1309
00:56:22.496 --> 00:56:24.997
an email
and it wasn't a very nice one.


1310
00:56:24.999 --> 00:56:25.697
Hmm.

1311
00:56:25.699 --> 00:56:26.832
We're gonna do the best we can.

1312
00:56:26.834 --> 00:56:28.934
And what about Rosetti
and Sandoval?


1313
00:56:28.936 --> 00:56:30.569
I haven't heard
from either of them.


1314
00:56:30.571 --> 00:56:32.070
- They won't confirm.
- All right, well,


1315
00:56:32.072 --> 00:56:34.873
I mean, so,
what are we doing tomorrow?


1316
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.015
Tim:<i>Toni put the big ad</i>
<i>for the town hall</i>


1317
00:56:43.017 --> 00:56:45.417
in the, uh, paper this morning.

1318
00:56:46.086 --> 00:56:47.619
(coins clinking)

1319
00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:49.588
Last one.

1320
00:56:51.425 --> 00:56:53.058
(horn honks)

1321
00:56:57.498 --> 00:57:01.066
It's not supposed
to be in Sports. Let me just...


1322
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.471
Call Toni Newman.

1323
00:57:07.808 --> 00:57:10.409
Hey, Siri. Toni,
I'll bring it back to the room,


1324
00:57:10.411 --> 00:57:12.878
but I'm telling you,
there's no ad


1325
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.112
for the town hall debate.

1326
00:57:14.114 --> 00:57:18.484
The "We have a rat problem" ad
isn't in there, either, so...


1327
00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:22.154
Well, that's a lot of money.

1328
00:57:22.156 --> 00:57:24.656
It doesn't do us any good
to put it in tomorrow.


1329
00:57:24.658 --> 00:57:28.227
You know what I mean?
I'm not saying it's your fault.


1330
00:57:28.229 --> 00:57:30.429
I'm saying that
it's not in the paper.


1331
00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:31.296
That's the news.

1332
00:57:31.298 --> 00:57:33.365
So, I'll be back
in a few minutes.


1333
00:57:33.667 --> 00:57:35.834
All right, yeah. Take care.

1334
00:57:36.237 --> 00:57:38.337
All right. Love you, too.

1335
00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:42.407
<i>She said she put that ad</i>
<i>in like a week ago</i>


1336
00:57:42.409 --> 00:57:43.675
<i>and that they needed more...</i>

1337
00:57:43.677 --> 00:57:46.044
<i>that she thinks they might have</i>
<i>needed more time,</i>


1338
00:57:46.046 --> 00:57:47.212
<i>but that sounds like bullshit.</i>

1339
00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:48.914
I'm not worried about it
because print media's dead


1340
00:57:48.916 --> 00:57:50.582
and there's not a lot of people
picking that up.


1341
00:57:50.584 --> 00:57:54.453
You saw the disarray
that the news stand was in.


1342
00:57:54.455 --> 00:57:56.154
Anyways, I don't... That's...

1343
00:57:56.156 --> 00:57:58.991
We don't need to use that stuff
'cause I...


1344
00:57:58.993 --> 00:58:00.359
I don't want to get her
in trouble.


1345
00:58:00.361 --> 00:58:01.960
I don't want to...
It's nobody's fault.


1346
00:58:01.962 --> 00:58:05.297
It's just...
There's a lot to do.


1347
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.800
(clears throat)
There's a lot to do.


1348
00:58:17.511 --> 00:58:18.677
How's that look?

1349
00:58:18.679 --> 00:58:22.214
Doing a little debate prep,
a little issue research.


1350
00:58:22.216 --> 00:58:26.318
<i>You know, that's pretty much</i>
<i>my day, has been prepping</i>


1351
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:30.255
<i>so I'm as educated as I can be</i>
<i>on the issues of San Bernardino</i>


1352
00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:32.057
<i>and also getting to a place</i>

1353
00:58:32.059 --> 00:58:34.059
where we have a real
competitive chance to win.


1354
00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:36.628
- Tim, where do you want to sit?
- Right in the middle.


1355
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:38.630
Right in the center? Okay.
I'll put you...


1356
00:58:38.632 --> 00:58:39.665
I'm gonna put you here.

1357
00:58:39.667 --> 00:58:41.233
Why don't we put a couple
on the table?


1358
00:58:41.235 --> 00:58:42.901
- What do you think?
- Tim: Oh, on his seat.


1359
00:58:42.903 --> 00:58:45.003
- Yeah. Or in front of him.
- (laughs) Yeah.


1360
00:58:45.005 --> 00:58:46.238
Let's do it.

1361
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:48.140
We have a rat problem.

1362
00:58:48.142 --> 00:58:49.374
- Tim: Yeah.
- (Toni laughs)


1363
00:58:49.376 --> 00:58:51.410
I'm getting to the place
where I'm kind of off-book


1364
00:58:51.412 --> 00:58:53.912
with this memorizing
all this stuff.


1365
00:58:53.914 --> 00:58:55.681
And I got a hundred more
of these books


1366
00:58:55.683 --> 00:58:58.717
waiting for me to put up here.

1367
00:58:58.719 --> 00:58:59.785
It's going very well.

1368
00:58:59.787 --> 00:59:01.486
The energy he had
in that parking lot


1369
00:59:01.488 --> 00:59:02.955
and the confrontation
was he wanted


1370
00:59:02.957 --> 00:59:04.256
to have nothing
to do with us.


1371
00:59:04.258 --> 00:59:06.158
Well, if he doesn't show,
that makes him look bad.


1372
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.728
I think the plan should be,
at 7:15, if there's no...


1373
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:13.131
if Rosetti doesn't show
and if Carlos doesn't show,


1374
00:59:13.133 --> 00:59:14.533
it becomes the town hall.

1375
00:59:14.535 --> 00:59:16.501
- Becomes about you.
- It becomes about me.


1376
00:59:16.503 --> 00:59:18.103
That's it.
That's what we want anyway.


1377
00:59:18.105 --> 00:59:19.972
- All right, cool. All right.
- Awesome.


1378
00:59:19.974 --> 00:59:21.573
I'm gonna clean up,
and I'm gonna head up


1379
00:59:21.575 --> 00:59:22.908
- to the room.
- Toni: All right.


1380
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:24.242
- Tim: You want to come?
- You know what?


1381
00:59:24.244 --> 00:59:25.744
Let me just tidy up
a little bit.


1382
00:59:25.746 --> 00:59:28.180
- I'll meet you up there
in a second, okay?
- Tim: Okay. All right.


1383
00:59:47.901 --> 00:59:49.668
(whispers) Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.


1384
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:54.640
<i>It's been an honor to be here</i>
<i>with you guys tonight.</i>


1385
00:59:54.642 --> 00:59:56.508
<i>I want to talk to you</i>
<i>about why I'm running</i>


1386
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:59.578
<i>for District Attorney</i>
<i>of San Bernardino.</i>


1387
00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.046
I'm gonna talk to you
about why...


1388
01:00:01.048 --> 01:00:03.181
I want to talk to you about why
I'm running for San Bern...


1389
01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.717
District Attorney
of San Bernardino.


1390
01:00:05.719 --> 01:00:07.185
<i>You know, I'm an outsider.</i>

1391
01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.920
(clearing throat)
<i>My name is Tim Heidecker.</i>


1392
01:00:08.922 --> 01:00:12.958
<i>I'm running for District</i>
<i>Attorney of San Bernardino.</i>


1393
01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.660
<i>It's good to meet you guys.</i>

1394
01:00:14.662 --> 01:00:17.229
<i>Sold-out crowd. 
Unbelievable.</i>

1395
01:00:17.231 --> 01:00:20.532
<i>We know firsthand...</i>
<i>we know firsthand</i>


1396
01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:24.169
<i>that our community is suffering</i>
<i>from high rates of crime,</i>


1397
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:31.810
<i>and my idea,</i>
<i>my campaign pledge is to...</i>


1398
01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:38.650
is to remove crime,
eliminate crime.


1399
01:00:41.088 --> 01:00:43.055
Well, I'm looking
at the world now,


1400
01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:44.222
and it's going insane.

1401
01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:47.025
Toni: Well, I'll do
a brief introduction


1402
01:00:47.027 --> 01:00:50.162
so that it looks really nice
before you come in.


1403
01:00:50.164 --> 01:00:51.430
What you got? I got some strays.

1404
01:00:51.432 --> 01:00:53.465
- I've been working
on that all morning.
- (laughs) I know,


1405
01:00:53.467 --> 01:00:56.201
- let me fix it.
- Are we just saying goodbye
to the debate idea?


1406
01:00:56.203 --> 01:00:58.837
- 'Cause they're... I mean...
- Toni: Well, let's give them


1407
01:00:58.839 --> 01:00:59.838
a little bit more time.

1408
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.273
I mean, they might
still show up.


1409
01:01:01.275 --> 01:01:03.508
So, I mean, we're still just
a few minutes over, so...


1410
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.577
I mean, we...
Okay, well, it's almost...


1411
01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:07.779
- It's 7:12 now.
- Yeah. I...


1412
01:01:07.781 --> 01:01:09.247
When are we pulling
the trigger on it?


1413
01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:10.716
Yeah, I don't have any messages
from them.


1414
01:01:10.718 --> 01:01:12.150
How about you?
Do you have any messages?


1415
01:01:12.152 --> 01:01:13.318
No, my iWatch has been quiet.

1416
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.888
<i>I think we hit Rosetti</i>
<i>right away...</i>


1417
01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.724
<i>or not... or either</i>
<i>we're gonna save that</i>


1418
01:01:18.726 --> 01:01:20.492
<i>- as the closing...</i>
- Toni:<i>Why don't we do this?</i>


1419
01:01:20.494 --> 01:01:22.127
Why don't we go
with the positive first?


1420
01:01:22.129 --> 01:01:25.097
Let's make you look good,
make you look amazing.


1421
01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:27.132
- Let's sell your points.
- I have one for one.


1422
01:01:27.134 --> 01:01:28.433
I don't want to say
"One for one."


1423
01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:29.701
I want to say
"Perfect record."


1424
01:01:29.703 --> 01:01:30.702
Well, let's just...

1425
01:01:30.704 --> 01:01:32.104
- your accomplishments...
- Mm-hmm.


1426
01:01:32.106 --> 01:01:34.206
- ...your goals.
- Small business.


1427
01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.341
You look really nice, Tim.

1428
01:01:36.343 --> 01:01:38.744
- Thank you.
- And you're gonna wow them.


1429
01:01:38.746 --> 01:01:40.512
Just get your mouth wet.

1430
01:01:40.514 --> 01:01:41.680
What do you have? Is it Orbits?

1431
01:01:41.682 --> 01:01:43.648
(Toni laughs)
It's your favorite. Of course.


1432
01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:44.950
- Great.
- Toni: How'd you know?


1433
01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:47.986
- Well, I know you carry Orbits.
- There you go.


1434
01:01:47.988 --> 01:01:49.788
Good luck.
We'll see you in there, okay?


1435
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.389
- Okay. See you.
- Toni: See you in a minute.


1436
01:01:51.391 --> 01:01:53.759
- Yeah. We'll talk soon.
- Toni: Okay.


1437
01:02:22.422 --> 01:02:26.057
Hey. This is the movie
I was telling you about,


1438
01:02:26.059 --> 01:02:30.095
<i>The Shaggy DA</i>
with Dean Jones from 1976.


1439
01:02:30.097 --> 01:02:31.730
It's got total parallels

1440
01:02:31.732 --> 01:02:34.132
to what Tim's campaign
is doing right now.


1441
01:02:34.134 --> 01:02:36.701
Like, if you watch it, it almost
feels like this campaign


1442
01:02:36.703 --> 01:02:38.036
is a remake of this movie.

1443
01:02:38.038 --> 01:02:41.406
Um, and it's out of print
on VHS, so I went ahead


1444
01:02:41.408 --> 01:02:44.342
and dubbed a copy and then
glued this thing over it


1445
01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:46.478
because you won't really
get this anywhere.


1446
01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.413
It's not on eBay or anywhere.

1447
01:02:48.415 --> 01:02:50.415
So, take a look
and see what you think.


1448
01:02:50.417 --> 01:02:52.918
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.


1449
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.120
Thank you all for coming.

1450
01:02:55.756 --> 01:02:58.123
Josh:

1451
01:02:58.125 --> 01:02:59.825
- What are you talking about?
- Josh: Gregg.


1452
01:02:59.827 --> 01:03:02.360
Here's here
at the town hall.


1453
01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.663
(crowd applauding)

1454
01:03:04.665 --> 01:03:07.933
- He's in the room right here?
- Josh: Yeah.


1455
01:03:08.902 --> 01:03:12.137
- Fuck.
<i>- ¶ Well I'm looking</i>

1465
01:03:38.365 --> 01:03:42.367
Thanks, guys, for coming out.
This is gonna be a good time.


1466
01:03:42.369 --> 01:03:44.469
(clears throat) Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,


1467
01:03:44.471 --> 01:03:46.471
for being here. 
This is, uh...

1468
01:03:46.473 --> 01:03:48.740
Well, we're gonna do things
a little differently.


1469
01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:49.941
I see you, by the way.

1470
01:03:49.943 --> 01:03:52.077
I see that you've decided
to show up,


1471
01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:54.613
and it's not...
you're not gonna ruin my night.


1472
01:03:54.615 --> 01:03:55.447
Gregg:

1473
01:03:55.449 --> 01:03:58.717
Well, save your questions
for the Q&A portion.


1474
01:03:58.719 --> 01:04:02.754
Um, I played this song here
that I wrote a few years ago.


1475
01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.155
How many people feel
that way lately,


1476
01:04:04.157 --> 01:04:07.025
it feels like the values,
the thing...


1477
01:04:07.027 --> 01:04:11.463
"The way things used to be
ain't that way no more"


1478
01:04:11.465 --> 01:04:12.564
is another expression.

1479
01:04:12.566 --> 01:04:16.034
And, uh, for some,
for people like you, it's...


1480
01:04:16.036 --> 01:04:19.337
it's a good opportunity...
(clears throat)


1481
01:04:19.339 --> 01:04:23.708
...but for the original
San Bernardino people...


1482
01:04:24.244 --> 01:04:25.377
of the '50s and '60s,

1483
01:04:25.379 --> 01:04:27.979
life has not... is getting
a little weird, isn't it?


1484
01:04:27.981 --> 01:04:31.783
Anyways, what else did I want
to say about that?


1485
01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:33.618
Demographics.

1486
01:04:33.687 --> 01:04:38.189
Um, imagine if you had
a candidate who stripped...


1487
01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:43.461
who promised on the day one that
we would be eliminating crime.


1488
01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.096
How many people would vote
for that candidate?


1489
01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:48.233
And we're talking 100 percent
elimination of crime.


1490
01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:51.169
That's what my candidacy
will deliver as DA.


1491
01:04:51.171 --> 01:04:52.337
My name is Tim Heidecker.

1492
01:04:52.339 --> 01:04:55.707
I'm a businessman,
a legal expert, an entrepreneur.


1493
01:04:55.709 --> 01:05:01.079
I've got several years
of experience in this area.


1494
01:05:01.081 --> 01:05:03.114
And I'm a proven leader.

1495
01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:06.751
I ran a small business here
in the county,


1496
01:05:06.753 --> 01:05:08.954
in Victorville, the...

1497
01:05:08.956 --> 01:05:12.123
the Victorville Film Archive
Film Center.


1498
01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.725
- You didn't run it.
- Tim: Excuse me?


1499
01:05:13.727 --> 01:05:15.827
- You didn't run it.
- Tim: I did run it, actually.


1500
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:17.028
- No. I ran it.
- Actually,


1501
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:18.496
this is not a Q&A period
of the show, sir,


1502
01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.132
so if you wouldn't mind
taking your hat off.


1503
01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:22.167
That's strike two.

1504
01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:24.769
And I won't be taking questions
from you, either.


1505
01:05:24.771 --> 01:05:26.838
I apologize. He's an instigator.

1506
01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:31.076
And how many people
have had trouble with Roset...


1507
01:05:31.078 --> 01:05:32.277
with Victor Ros... I'm sorry.

1508
01:05:32.279 --> 01:05:34.813
That should be
"Vincent Rosetti."


1509
01:05:36.483 --> 01:05:37.716
Toni.

1510
01:05:37.718 --> 01:05:40.185
But the question is,
where is Rosetti? Where is he?


1511
01:05:40.187 --> 01:05:43.922
Where is... What...
He's hiding in some rat hole.


1512
01:05:43.924 --> 01:05:48.493
He does not want to come
and face me in the arena.


1513
01:05:52.065 --> 01:05:53.365
Okay?

1514
01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:54.532
We have a rat problem.

1515
01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:57.769
- (cell phone dings)
- We got to ch...
set the rat trap!


1516
01:05:57.771 --> 01:06:01.673
And I'm the exterminator.
You know?


1517
01:06:01.675 --> 01:06:04.409
So, we're trying
to get that going.


1518
01:06:04.411 --> 01:06:06.344
We have a rat problem.

1519
01:06:06.346 --> 01:06:07.679
And that would be great
if everybody


1520
01:06:07.681 --> 01:06:09.314
was joining in on that.

1521
01:06:09.316 --> 01:06:12.050
We have a rat problem.

1522
01:06:12.753 --> 01:06:14.252
We have a rat problem.

1523
01:06:14.254 --> 01:06:16.388
- woman: We have a rat problem.
- We have a rat problem.


1524
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.057
And it's Rosetti the Rat.
He's corrupt.


1525
01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:20.525
And I actually have
some experience,


1526
01:06:20.527 --> 01:06:22.527
interestingly enough,
of dealing with corruption.


1527
01:06:22.529 --> 01:06:25.130
I wrote and produced
and directed and starred in


1528
01:06:25.132 --> 01:06:28.433
the great<i>Decker</i> TV show,
currently on hiatus.


1529
01:06:28.435 --> 01:06:33.004
And had an interesting character
that some of you guys


1530
01:06:33.006 --> 01:06:36.074
probably remember,
President Jason Davidson,


1531
01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:39.144
one of the most
corrupt politicians in history,


1532
01:06:39.146 --> 01:06:41.479
if you could believe that.
Production always said


1533
01:06:41.481 --> 01:06:43.615
how well<i>Decker</i> actually dealt

1534
01:06:43.617 --> 01:06:47.585
with the whole
corruption concept.


1535
01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:48.753
So I'm way ahead of that,

1536
01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:54.225
and we're having a good time
figuring out. So, uh...


1537
01:06:54.528 --> 01:06:55.693
you put your hat back on.

1538
01:06:55.695 --> 01:06:59.097
Can you take your hat off
if you're gonna be inside?


1539
01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:03.134
Thank you. Medicaid fraud...
we have that in the news lately.


1540
01:07:03.136 --> 01:07:06.237
I don't know if you've seen
this Medicaid fraud.


1541
01:07:06.239 --> 01:07:09.741
We have people taking advantage
of the system.


1542
01:07:09.743 --> 01:07:13.311
There's people out there
who are basically vegetables,


1543
01:07:13.313 --> 01:07:15.480
who are brain-dead
and who have not...


1544
01:07:15.482 --> 01:07:16.614
can't feed themselves.

1545
01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.883
And then you have people who are
taking advantage of those people


1546
01:07:18.885 --> 01:07:21.186
and taking a paycheck
from that experience.


1547
01:07:21.188 --> 01:07:24.522
And that's something
I'm gonna be fighting for,


1548
01:07:24.524 --> 01:07:25.824
so watch...

1549
01:07:25.826 --> 01:07:27.826
- watch out for that.
- Gregg: You're the one
that put them


1550
01:07:27.828 --> 01:07:29.761
- in that position
in the first place...
- Tim: Excuse me?


1551
01:07:29.763 --> 01:07:31.629
...by depriving oxygen
with a scuba tank


1552
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:33.398
- that didn't work.
- Tim: Now, we're not getting


1553
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.301
into the details of that case.
That's a very sensitive case.


1554
01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:39.904
And, anyways, we are, uh,
gonna open it up to the floor,


1555
01:07:39.906 --> 01:07:43.775
if anybody has any questions.
It is a town hall event.


1556
01:07:43.777 --> 01:07:46.311
- Gregg: I have a question.
Why did you...
- Tim: No. I'm sorry.


1557
01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:47.946
We're not taking questions
from you.


1558
01:07:47.948 --> 01:07:48.980
If you're wearing a hat,

1559
01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:50.482
you will not be allowed
to ask a question.


1560
01:07:50.484 --> 01:07:52.083
- Why did you say that...
- Tim: Ma'am... Shut up.


1561
01:07:52.085 --> 01:07:54.185
Now ask your question.
You may ask a question.


1562
01:07:54.187 --> 01:07:56.020
- Indidi: Hello. Good evening.
- Good evening to you.


1563
01:07:56.022 --> 01:07:57.622
- So, you mentioned...
- What's your name, by the way?


1564
01:07:57.624 --> 01:07:59.224
- I didn't get...
- My name is Indidi.


1565
01:07:59.226 --> 01:08:01.025
- Indidi. Indeedy, we sh...
- Yes.


1566
01:08:01.027 --> 01:08:04.362
Uh, Indidi, indeedy,
it's nice to see you.


1567
01:08:04.364 --> 01:08:06.231
- Nice to see you, too. Yes.
- Indidi.


1568
01:08:06.233 --> 01:08:08.299
So, you mentioned
how it's your pledge


1569
01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:10.735
to erase crime in the community.

1570
01:08:10.737 --> 01:08:12.137
How would you make sure
that defendants


1571
01:08:12.139 --> 01:08:14.472
still get a fair trial
while accomplishing your goal


1572
01:08:14.474 --> 01:08:16.040
of eliminating crime
in our communities?


1573
01:08:16.042 --> 01:08:18.476
Terrific question. Thank you
for asking that question.


1574
01:08:18.478 --> 01:08:22.947
It's really nice to get
that kind of brain here,


1575
01:08:22.949 --> 01:08:25.116
that kind of thinking,
which you...


1576
01:08:25.118 --> 01:08:28.019
you excel in, frankly.

1577
01:08:28.155 --> 01:08:29.587
Um...

1578
01:08:30.157 --> 01:08:31.589
you know, a little personal,

1579
01:08:31.591 --> 01:08:35.260
but I was wrongly accused
of a crime myself.


1580
01:08:35.262 --> 01:08:37.762
So, that's one of the reasons
I'm running, actually,


1581
01:08:37.764 --> 01:08:40.198
Indidi, indeedy,
is why I'm running.


1582
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.500
Um, yes, indeedy,
that is why I'm running.


1583
01:08:42.502 --> 01:08:44.669
Uh, represented myself
in court...


1584
01:08:44.671 --> 01:08:48.306
and successfully, I might add,
where I was convict...


1585
01:08:48.308 --> 01:08:49.340
I was not convicted.

1586
01:08:49.342 --> 01:08:52.477
I was accused of something,
but I did...


1587
01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.179
- Mass murder.
- Excuse me?


1588
01:08:54.181 --> 01:08:56.814
Mass murder,
killing 19 people.


1589
01:08:56.816 --> 01:08:59.918
It doesn't matter
what I was accused of.


1590
01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.886
What matters is the truth.

1591
01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:05.323
The truth is, the court
of San Bernardino


1592
01:09:05.325 --> 01:09:06.424
found me not guilty,

1593
01:09:06.426 --> 01:09:12.030
despite the worst best efforts
of Rosetti and his squad of rats


1594
01:09:12.032 --> 01:09:14.098
and pigs.

1595
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:18.870
So, my point is,
to get to your question,


1596
01:09:19.139 --> 01:09:21.506
I will be fighting
for the innocent.


1597
01:09:21.508 --> 01:09:24.342
Now, if you commit a crime
on my watch...


1598
01:09:24.678 --> 01:09:27.712
you're going to jail
forever, right?


1599
01:09:27.714 --> 01:09:30.281
No more three strikes,
you're out. You're done.


1600
01:09:30.283 --> 01:09:32.884
That's the community
we want to create.


1601
01:09:32.886 --> 01:09:34.886
But if you're innocent,
let's let...


1602
01:09:34.888 --> 01:09:36.087
let's let you be innocent.

1603
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:39.457
Let's not put the courts...
Let's not put you under the...


1604
01:09:39.459 --> 01:09:42.927
the heel of just...
of corrupt justice.


1605
01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:44.596
- Tim: Anybody else?
- Why did you say that you...


1606
01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:46.164
- I didn't call on you.
- I just want to know


1607
01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:48.900
why you said that you were
a small business owner


1608
01:09:48.902 --> 01:09:51.636
and ran the VFA
when you didn't run the VFA.


1609
01:09:51.638 --> 01:09:54.072
- You burned the VFA down.
- I did not burn...


1610
01:09:54.074 --> 01:09:55.306
See, that's false accusations.

1611
01:09:55.308 --> 01:09:57.075
This is what got me into trouble
in the first place.


1612
01:09:57.077 --> 01:09:59.177
- Two times you burned down
the film archive.
- No, that's not true.


1613
01:09:59.179 --> 01:10:01.145
That's off-limits,
as a subject goes, today.


1614
01:10:01.147 --> 01:10:04.115
Gregg: Well, if you're running
for a District Attorney job,


1615
01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:05.617
people should know
that you're an arsonist.


1616
01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:07.952
I'm not an... How dare you,
calling me an arsonist?


1617
01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.254
That's illegal,
what you're doing.


1618
01:10:09.256 --> 01:10:10.655
- You're...
- You had ownership


1619
01:10:10.657 --> 01:10:14.058
in the film theater,
the Victorville Film Center,


1620
01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.526
but that's different
than the archive,


1621
01:10:15.528 --> 01:10:16.928
- which I ran.
- Tim: That's not...


1622
01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:18.463
- I ran the archive.
- That is irrelevant


1623
01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:20.164
- to this situation.
- Gregg: I ran both of them.


1624
01:10:20.166 --> 01:10:22.200
- Excuse me.
- Gregg: I ran both
the film center


1625
01:10:22.202 --> 01:10:23.268
and the film archive,

1626
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:24.836
but you burned down
the film archive.


1627
01:10:24.838 --> 01:10:25.903
You didn't run that.

1628
01:10:25.905 --> 01:10:27.939
So don't tell these people
you have a small business


1629
01:10:27.941 --> 01:10:29.574
in Victorville
because you never did.


1630
01:10:29.576 --> 01:10:31.476
That business didn't...
wouldn't exist without me...


1631
01:10:31.478 --> 01:10:32.944
- Gregg: You can't even name...
- ...actually.


1632
01:10:32.946 --> 01:10:35.013
...three movies
that came out in the 1980s.


1633
01:10:35.015 --> 01:10:37.382
I'm not running for mayor
of Movie Town.


1634
01:10:37.384 --> 01:10:39.350
I'm running
for District Attorney.


1635
01:10:39.352 --> 01:10:41.386
You're delusional.
This guy, by the way,


1636
01:10:41.388 --> 01:10:45.423
is, like, obsessed
with collecting old videotapes.


1637
01:10:45.425 --> 01:10:46.858
Nobody even watches videotapes
anymore.


1638
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.260
Gregg: Yeah, they do.
A lot of people have both.


1639
01:10:49.262 --> 01:10:52.130
Do you have a DVD player
or a di...


1640
01:10:52.132 --> 01:10:54.499
- what is it? The VHS player?
- DVD.


1641
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:56.968
What do you got, DVD?
You guys a couple?


1642
01:10:56.970 --> 01:10:58.803
You didn't run the film archive,
is my point,


1643
01:10:58.805 --> 01:11:00.538
'cause you don't know
anything about movies,


1644
01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:02.073
so you couldn't have
run a film archive.


1645
01:11:02.075 --> 01:11:05.143
What do you... what do you care?
Why are you here?


1646
01:11:05.145 --> 01:11:06.944
- You're here to ruin me.
- Gregg: I'm here


1647
01:11:06.946 --> 01:11:08.379
because I needed to give
something to


1648
01:11:08.381 --> 01:11:10.248
- your cameraman...
- Shame on you.
This guy is a pig.


1649
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:12.483
He's coming... He's driven
in here from Hollywood...


1650
01:11:12.485 --> 01:11:14.452
- He's driven in here
from Hollywood...
- Gregg: So did you.


1651
01:11:14.454 --> 01:11:16.220
- to disrupt the process.
- You don't live here.


1652
01:11:16.222 --> 01:11:17.955
Tim: Huh? I do live here.
I live right here


1653
01:11:17.957 --> 01:11:20.158
- in this building.
I am a resident of the...
- Just 'cause you rented


1654
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.026
- a hotel room for a night...
- Tim: I'm a resident of...


1655
01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.762
This is a work-home environment.
And I have my mail coming...


1656
01:11:24.764 --> 01:11:26.964
How do I have my fucking mail
coming here...


1657
01:11:26.966 --> 01:11:28.966
How do I have
my fucking mail coming here...


1658
01:11:28.968 --> 01:11:31.369
- Gregg: You could get P.O. box.
- ...if it's not where I live?


1659
01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:35.973
- Rosetti owns a house.
- Stay out of this process.


1660
01:11:35.975 --> 01:11:38.843
That's my message.
So, I'm sorry.


1661
01:11:38.845 --> 01:11:43.014
I apologize for the use
of the "F" word and, uh...


1662
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.016
Yes. Thank you.

1663
01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:48.519
I asked him to go,
and he didn't listen.


1664
01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:50.021
Fuck!

1665
01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:52.256
- Tim!
- I'm sorry!


1666
01:11:52.258 --> 01:11:54.926
I'm looking at you
the whole fucking way!


1667
01:11:54.928 --> 01:11:56.694
Why don't you ask him
to get security...


1668
01:11:56.696 --> 01:11:59.497
- get somebody
to get fucking security?
- Tim, calm down! Calm down!


1669
01:11:59.499 --> 01:12:01.466
- Fuck this!
- Toni: You can't use that word!


1670
01:12:01.468 --> 01:12:04.168
I just wanted to get that
videotape back on the weekend,


1671
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:05.670
so I'll be in touch
with you guys.


1672
01:12:05.672 --> 01:12:09.107
But go ahead and watch it
and then see what you think,


1673
01:12:09.109 --> 01:12:11.676
and I'll get it on the weekend.

1674
01:12:11.678 --> 01:12:13.344
Okay. Thanks.

1675
01:12:13.346 --> 01:12:14.712
Rewind it.

1676
01:12:16.783 --> 01:12:18.983
Toni: So sorry, everybody,
for his outburst.


1677
01:12:18.985 --> 01:12:21.352
He's been under a lot of stress.

1678
01:12:21.354 --> 01:12:24.489
(indistinct chatter)

1679
01:12:24.491 --> 01:12:27.058
I'm sorry, everybody.
Thanks. I appreciate it.


1680
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:29.494
You don't understand.
I'm a very passionate guy.


1681
01:12:29.496 --> 01:12:30.995
I'm passionate for you guys.

1682
01:12:30.997 --> 01:12:32.864
And it's been a lot of...
been a long time...


1683
01:12:32.866 --> 01:12:37.101
it's been a long, um,
couple of days, okay?


1684
01:12:37.303 --> 01:12:39.437
I am so sorry. (sniffles)

1685
01:12:40.807 --> 01:12:41.606
Thank you.

1686
01:12:41.608 --> 01:12:42.840
- Can we take some food?
- Yeah.


1687
01:12:42.842 --> 01:12:44.275
- Toni: Absolutely.
- Tim: Help yourself.


1688
01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:45.910
Toni: Please, help yourself.

1689
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:52.316
Thank you, guys.

1690
01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:58.289
We'll get them in...
We'll get out tomorrow


1691
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:01.826
and get down there
and just get out there.


1692
01:13:01.895 --> 01:13:03.461
I mean, there's not a lot
of people there,


1693
01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:05.196
so it doesn't matter.
It's not like they're gonna...


1694
01:13:05.198 --> 01:13:06.664
If it was bad,
it would be 1000 people.


1695
01:13:06.666 --> 01:13:09.167
- It'd be everybody
talking about...
- (watch chimes)


1696
01:13:10.036 --> 01:13:13.171
You guys are gonna need to take
a piss break or something.


1697
01:13:13.173 --> 01:13:15.206
I got to be alone.

1698
01:13:21.948 --> 01:13:24.415
Gregg: Oh, it's like,
I told you guys that Tim's nuts.


1699
01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:26.083
Josh: Gregg, can you take
your hat off for a second?


1700
01:13:26.085 --> 01:13:28.219
- Just the lights.
- Do I need to?


1701
01:13:28.221 --> 01:13:30.655
Josh: It's just casting a shadow
on your face.


1702
01:13:30.657 --> 01:13:33.858
He goes in there, and he starts
dropping the VFA name


1703
01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.526
to try to win voters over.

1704
01:13:35.528 --> 01:13:37.361
And it's not really fair
to movie buffs


1705
01:13:37.363 --> 01:13:39.330
that might think
they should vote for him


1706
01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:41.365
that he has something to do
with that archive,


1707
01:13:41.367 --> 01:13:42.867
other than having
caught it on fire.


1708
01:13:42.869 --> 01:13:47.305
I told you that he was nuts
and you were wasting your time,


1709
01:13:47.307 --> 01:13:48.372
and you didn't listen.

1710
01:13:48.374 --> 01:13:49.807
And now you're still
wasting your time


1711
01:13:49.809 --> 01:13:51.375
'cause you want to talk
about him more.


1712
01:13:51.377 --> 01:13:53.411
What you should talk about
is the movies.


1713
01:13:53.413 --> 01:13:56.414
But you guys don't seem
too interested,


1714
01:13:56.416 --> 01:13:58.549
so best of luck to you.

1715
01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:12.864
Tim:<i>All right, well, is there</i>
<i>anybody else I can speak with?</i>


1716
01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:14.398
<i>Because...</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>


1717
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.803
Like, is there anybody above you
I can speak with?


1718
01:14:18.805 --> 01:14:20.671
'Cause this seems like...

1719
01:14:23.743 --> 01:14:26.611
If they're printed already,
is there not a way


1720
01:14:26.613 --> 01:14:28.579
to hold the elect...

1721
01:14:28.581 --> 01:14:31.516
I don't know, stop...
like, delay the election


1722
01:14:31.518 --> 01:14:32.950
until we can fix the mistake?

1723
01:14:32.952 --> 01:14:36.053
Because... So,
what are you telling me?


1724
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:38.723
That I have to, what?

1725
01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:42.159
That they... Can they write
my name in at this point?


1726
01:14:43.096 --> 01:14:45.496
If I'm not on the ballot,
how am I supposed to compete


1727
01:14:45.498 --> 01:14:47.865
if those two other fuckers
are on the ba...


1728
01:14:47.867 --> 01:14:48.799
No. I apologize.

1729
01:14:48.801 --> 01:14:52.103
If those two guys
are on the ballot, right?


1730
01:14:52.105 --> 01:14:55.806
So, you're...
This whole thing... You're...


1731
01:14:55.808 --> 01:14:58.342
This board of elections
in San Bernardino County...


1732
01:14:58.344 --> 01:15:00.611
I know.
You've won this round, I guess,


1733
01:15:00.613 --> 01:15:03.314
but I'm gonna get the word out
starting tonight.


1734
01:15:03.316 --> 01:15:05.416
We're gonna start
making phone calls.


1735
01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:09.787
Well, that's a little...
too little... little too late.


1736
01:15:09.856 --> 01:15:11.322
We're a little past that.

1737
01:15:11.324 --> 01:15:12.924
And if you guys would have been
more cooperative


1738
01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:17.762
from the beginning and...
then we wouldn't be here.


1739
01:15:17.764 --> 01:15:21.599
So, tell your boss
to go fuck himself.


1740
01:15:22.702 --> 01:15:24.936
Hello? Yeah.

1741
01:15:25.138 --> 01:15:27.238
- Great.
- Oh, Tim.


1742
01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.041
Tim: You know, it's blank!
(sighs)


1743
01:15:30.343 --> 01:15:34.645
(inhales)

1744
01:15:34.647 --> 01:15:36.047
Tim.

1745
01:15:37.483 --> 01:15:39.083
Okay, we're not on the ballot.

1746
01:15:39.085 --> 01:15:44.755
We are a write-in candidacy.
It's an insurgency candidacy.


1747
01:15:46.593 --> 01:15:48.526
And that's the news.

1748
01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:50.761
So, I'm gonna get some ice.

1749
01:15:51.898 --> 01:15:54.832
- (thuds)
- Tim! Jesus Christ.


1750
01:15:54.834 --> 01:15:57.935
- (scoffs)
- (door opens)


1751
01:16:02.241 --> 01:16:04.408
(Tim sighs)

1752
01:16:20.126 --> 01:16:21.726
Oh, my God.

1753
01:16:21.728 --> 01:16:26.130
- (pounds on door)
- Tim: Toni?


1754
01:16:26.132 --> 01:16:29.066
- Toni: Tim? Tim?
- Hey, I'm sorry.


1755
01:16:29.068 --> 01:16:30.434
Toni: You have to calm down,
Tim.


1756
01:16:30.436 --> 01:16:32.336
- I'm calm. I'm sorry.
- Toni: Calm down.


1757
01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:35.940
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Stop throwing things.


1758
01:16:35.942 --> 01:16:39.677
I didn't... I just threw a beer.
I'm not being violent.


1759
01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:41.278
(Tim sighs)

1760
01:16:43.082 --> 01:16:44.148
Toni: I... I...

1761
01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:49.186
I don't even know what to say
to any of this at this point.


1762
01:16:50.223 --> 01:16:51.088
Tim: Yeah.

1763
01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:54.025
Well, I need a little bit
of space right now.


1764
01:16:54.027 --> 01:16:56.060
So why don't you, um...

1765
01:16:56.262 --> 01:16:57.728
why don't you give me that
right now?


1766
01:16:57.730 --> 01:17:00.564
I think I just need...
I need a little bit of...


1767
01:17:00.967 --> 01:17:03.334
I need a little bit
of space, so...


1768
01:17:03.336 --> 01:17:06.570
Do you want to just give me
a little bit of that?


1769
01:17:06.639 --> 01:17:08.139
Of course.

1770
01:17:10.043 --> 01:17:11.342
Yeah.

1771
01:17:13.513 --> 01:17:15.312
(Toni sighs)

1772
01:17:35.301 --> 01:17:36.967

1801
01:19:46.232 --> 01:19:50.134
Hello. Is it Vincent?
It's Tim Heidecker...


1802
01:19:50.436 --> 01:19:55.406
calling to concede to you
for winning election...


1803
01:19:55.408 --> 01:19:56.807
the election...

1804
01:19:57.844 --> 01:20:00.444
and wish you congra...
wish you luck.


1805
01:20:00.446 --> 01:20:04.215
And it was a good, hard race.

1806
01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:06.283
And you won.

1807
01:20:06.285 --> 01:20:10.221
I know that you were behind
many of the tricks


1808
01:20:10.223 --> 01:20:13.090
that you screwed me
with getting...


1809
01:20:13.092 --> 01:20:18.195
shutting my... shutting down
the press and everything else.


1810
01:20:18.197 --> 01:20:19.630
And, uh...

1811
01:20:19.632 --> 01:20:22.399
uh... you uh...

1812
01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.335
you suck, you know?

1813
01:20:24.337 --> 01:20:28.305
And you...
you had the easiest case ever


1814
01:20:28.307 --> 01:20:31.876
in the history of courts
against me,


1815
01:20:31.878 --> 01:20:34.511
and you had the smoking gun,

1816
01:20:34.513 --> 01:20:36.080
and you couldn't even
close that.


1817
01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:39.316
So, just... You got to sleep
with that shit.


1818
01:20:39.318 --> 01:20:43.787
And I'm gonna get you
next election cycle.


1819
01:20:43.789 --> 01:20:44.788
(phone clicks)

1820
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:49.226
We're living in a culture
that is more and more about...


1821
01:20:50.963 --> 01:20:55.866
what's glittery,
style over substance.


1822
01:20:55.868 --> 01:20:59.336
And Mr. Heidecker brought that
into the courtroom.


1823
01:20:59.338 --> 01:21:03.274
We don't value substance.
We don't value character.


1824
01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:05.576
I mean,
Mr. Heidecker's character,


1825
01:21:05.578 --> 01:21:07.578
as far as I'm concerned, is nil.

1826
01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.114
There is no character there.

1827
01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:12.116
I lost my heart...

1828
01:21:12.351 --> 01:21:16.120
for the courtroom after that.

1829
01:21:16.122 --> 01:21:18.155
<i>Once you lose that</i>
<i>sense of purpose...</i>


1830
01:21:18.157 --> 01:21:20.958
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what profession you're in...</i>


1831
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.227
<i>it's time to move on.</i>

1832
01:21:25.431 --> 01:21:27.898
Tim: So, this is, uh...

1833
01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:31.135
this is it. This is the spot.

1834
01:21:31.237 --> 01:21:33.570
It's the site
of the Electric Sun, uh,


1835
01:21:33.572 --> 01:21:35.506
20 music festival...

1836
01:21:35.508 --> 01:21:39.610
that they've condemned,
but you can sneak in here.


1837
01:21:41.781 --> 01:21:46.050
I haven't really been back here
since that night.


1838
01:21:46.619 --> 01:21:50.988
This place was a...
was just filled with bodies.


1839
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:52.156
That's, like, my last memory

1840
01:21:52.158 --> 01:21:54.224
'cause I was kind of
buzzed myself.


1841
01:21:54.226 --> 01:21:57.895
So I was seeing, sort of,
flashes of...


1842
01:21:58.464 --> 01:22:01.832
sick kids and, you know...

1843
01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:04.735
I don't know how much
you want to talk about that.


1844
01:22:04.737 --> 01:22:06.136
(sighs)

1845
01:22:06.939 --> 01:22:09.340
You know, shit happens.

1846
01:22:14.914 --> 01:22:17.081
It was, you know,
one of those bittersweet things


1847
01:22:17.083 --> 01:22:21.151
because it... it was such
a horrible, tragic event


1848
01:22:21.153 --> 01:22:22.686
<i>that we would take back</i>
<i>in a minute,</i>


1849
01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:25.389
<i>but at the same time,</i>
<i>it got me to this place</i>


1850
01:22:25.391 --> 01:22:27.024
<i>where I was able to come out</i>

1851
01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:29.259
<i>and get in the ring,</i>
<i>get in the arena.</i>


1852
01:22:29.261 --> 01:22:33.664
<i>And, um, as much as I lost,</i>
<i>you know, and didn't...</i>


1853
01:22:33.666 --> 01:22:35.799
<i>didn't win,</i>
<i>that's the risk I took.</i>


1854
01:22:35.801 --> 01:22:39.737
<i>And that is not something</i>
<i>I would ever change.</i>


1855
01:22:39.739 --> 01:22:41.805
<i>I wouldn't change a thing.</i>

1856
01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:45.809
If they're doing...
they would have counted the...


1857
01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:49.113
the absentee ballots
and everything like that, right,


1858
01:22:49.115 --> 01:22:52.349
like, the provisional
ballots and... Yeah.


1859
01:22:52.351 --> 01:22:54.084
<i>I fought fair,</i>
<i>I fought honestly,</i>


1860
01:22:54.086 --> 01:23:00.958
and you know, I should probably
give Rosetti a concession call.


1861
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.026
(sniffles) Um...

1862
01:23:02.028 --> 01:23:05.729
You know? I guess that's the...
the right thing to do, which...


1863
01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.598
You know, I should have done
that last night.


1864
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.100
I'm gonna do something,
and you can film it or not.


1865
01:23:10.102 --> 01:23:14.271
I don't care.
I just... saw this.


1866
01:23:21.047 --> 01:23:24.148
This is for the Electric Sun 19,

1867
01:23:24.150 --> 01:23:31.121
who accidentally overdosed
on medicine that was...


1868
01:23:31.123 --> 01:23:34.091
that was tainted
by the Chinese government.


1869
01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:36.960
And, uh, I'm sorry that I...

1870
01:23:36.962 --> 01:23:41.465
that I was in any way connected
with it and that I was a...


1871
01:23:41.467 --> 01:23:44.334
a bystander
to the massacre here.


1872
01:23:44.503 --> 01:23:45.903
And forever we...

1873
01:23:45.905 --> 01:23:49.373
we know that you guys
are looking down on us, and...


1874
01:23:51.444 --> 01:23:54.611
you know, we wish you were
with us today.


1875
01:23:55.014 --> 01:23:57.614
Let me put that here.

1876
01:24:04.557 --> 01:24:07.024
Does this work if I stand it up?

1877
01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:18.335
How's this look?
Can you get this and...


1878
01:24:18.537 --> 01:24:20.504
Can you get the flowers,

1879
01:24:20.506 --> 01:24:24.908
if you rake up from flowers
to me, mountains, sky?


1880
01:24:26.712 --> 01:24:29.646
That's your.. probably
your end shot, right?


1881
01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:30.814
Dedicated... Something with text

1882
01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:34.017
dedicated to the memory
of the Electric Sun 19?


1883
01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:38.288
Something like that?

1884
01:24:38.724 --> 01:24:42.359
Yup. Okay, cool. Great.
We got it? Cool.


1885
01:24:42.361 --> 01:24:44.394
I think that'll play nice
as your ending.


1886
01:24:44.396 --> 01:24:47.531
I don't want to tell you
what to do, but if you can


1887
01:24:47.533 --> 01:24:48.599
just send me a rough cut

1888
01:24:48.601 --> 01:24:51.201
and I'll give you notes, um,
that would be great.


1889
01:24:51.203 --> 01:24:52.769
I think you guys did
a great job.


1890
01:24:52.771 --> 01:24:55.172
From what I could see,
everything looked great.


1891
01:24:55.174 --> 01:24:56.907
I wish you would have gotten
a version where I won.


1892
01:24:56.909 --> 01:24:58.976
That would have made,
probably, a more interesting


1893
01:24:58.978 --> 01:25:00.010
documentary for you.

1894
01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:02.246
But maybe next time
you can follow me around


1895
01:25:02.248 --> 01:25:03.347
on my next adventure,

1896
01:25:03.349 --> 01:25:06.884
"Whale Man," or whatever it is,
run for governor.


1897
01:25:06.886 --> 01:25:10.988
- (watch chimes)
- Tim: Ah! That's Toni.


1898
01:25:11.056 --> 01:25:14.124
Okay, I got to call her.
She wants to talk.


1899
01:25:14.627 --> 01:25:15.993
But that's just sort of me
and her,


1900
01:25:15.995 --> 01:25:19.630
so that's a wrap on this,
I believe, don't you think?


1901
01:25:20.232 --> 01:25:21.965
- Josh: Yep.
- Tim: Okay.


1902
01:25:21.967 --> 01:25:26.103
And don't use any of that shit
with Gregg, you know...


1903
01:25:26.105 --> 01:25:29.039
or the stuff
in the hotel room with the...


1904
01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:33.710
Just keep it... Keep it
sort of positive, I think.


1905
01:25:34.613 --> 01:25:35.979
Good luck.

1921
01:26:43.382 --> 01:26:46.717
<i>¶ Now I'm so useless ¶</i>

1922
01:26:46.719 --> 01:26:52.489
<i>¶ Oh can't you see</i>
<i>That I'd be useless ¶</i>


1923
01:26:52.491 --> 01:26:56.126
<i>¶ Without you loving me ¶</i>

1924
01:26:56.128 --> 01:27:00.797
<i>¶ Like you do? 
Used less ¶</i>

1925
01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:06.169
<i>¶ Oh darling, now my lips</i>
<i>Are used less ¶</i>


1926
01:27:06.171 --> 01:27:11.375
<i>¶ 'Cause you're not here</i>
<i>With me ¶</i>


1927
01:27:12.211 --> 01:27:16.113
<i>¶ I slowly drove back</i>
<i>To our house ¶</i>


1928
01:27:16.115 --> 01:27:20.117
<i>¶ The dawn</i>
<i>Was breaking through ¶</i>


1929
01:27:20.119 --> 01:27:24.621
<i>¶ I walked inside</i>
<i>And then I saw ¶</i>


1930
01:27:24.623 --> 01:27:28.358
<i>¶ Old memories of you ¶</i>

1931
01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:32.129
<i>¶ My teardrops fell so softly ¶</i>

1932
01:27:32.131 --> 01:27:35.565
<i>¶ As I was standing there ¶</i>

1933
01:27:35.567 --> 01:27:43.607
<i>¶ My wild imagination made me</i>
<i>Think that you still cared ¶</i>


1934
01:27:43.609 --> 01:27:47.110
<i>¶ Then you were gone ¶</i>

1935
01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:50.714
<i>¶ Now I'm so useless ¶</i>

1936
01:27:50.716 --> 01:27:56.486
<i>¶ Oh can't you see</i>
<i>That I'd be useless ¶</i>


1937
01:27:56.488 --> 01:28:00.157
<i>¶ Without you loving me ¶</i>

1938
01:28:00.159 --> 01:28:04.961
<i>¶ Like you do? 
Used less ¶</i>

1939
01:28:04.963 --> 01:28:10.233
<i>¶ Oh darling, now my lips</i>
<i>Are used less ¶</i>


1940
01:28:10.235 --> 01:28:17.274
<i>¶ 'Cause you're not here</i>
<i>With me ¶</i>
