00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:24.825
(music) Some days are diamonds (music)

2
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.564
(music) Some days are rocks (music)

3
00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:34.405
(music) Some doors are open (music)

4
00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:39.140
(music) Some roads are blocked (music)

5
00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:44.174
(music) Sundowns are golden (music)

6
00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:48.587
(music) Then fade away (music)

7
00:00:48.657 --> 00:00:53.321
(music) And if I never do nothin' (music)

8
00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:56.228
(music) I'll catch your back someday (music)

9
00:00:56.298 --> 00:01:01.998
(music) 'Cause you got
a heart so big (music)

10
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.870
(music) It could crush this town (music)

11
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:10.878
(music) And I can't hold out forever (music)

12
00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:16.077
(music) Even walls fall down (music)

13
00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.529
(music) You got a heart so big (music)

14
00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:43.806
(music) It could crush this town (music)

15
00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:48.714
(music) And I can't hold out forever (music)

16
00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:53.847
(music) Even walls fall down (music)

17
00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:58.450
(music) Yeah, they do (music)

18
00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:00.586
(music) They fall down (music)

19
00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:41.360
Cigar?

20
00:02:41.436 --> 00:02:43.028
No No, I'm gonna wait
till we get out there


21
00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:44.538
You about
ready to go?


22
00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:46.039
Yeah, I am

23
00:02:46.108 --> 00:02:47.405
Where's
your sister?


24
00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:49.410
He's in the bathroom
primping himself


25
00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:52.003
He thinks we're going to
a fashion show, I guess


26
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.047
[Thud]

27
00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:54.207
Come on,
sweetheart


28
00:02:54.282 --> 00:02:55.271
While we're
still young


29
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.578
What do you
think, Dad?


30
00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:57.879
Have you ever seen such
a good-looking head of hair?


31
00:02:57.953 --> 00:03:00.046
Frank: Just get your ass
moving, pretty boy


32
00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:02.521
Hey, tough guy

33
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.354
don't want to start
the first fishing trip of the summer


34
00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:06.121
with a cigar, huh?

35
00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:07.627
And you wonder why
your breath stinks


36
00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:09.061
and your teeth
are green, right?


37
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.292
My teeth are not
green, my man


38
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:13.095
Yeah, but they sure as shit
ain't white...


39
00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:14.601
All right,
come on, ladies!


40
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:15.931
I'm not gonna have you start
the summer off with your bickering


41
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:17.335
Come on, Mickey,
let's go


42
00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:18.464
Francis,
your brother's right


43
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.564
Go brush your teeth,
will you?


44
00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:20.699
Your breath's
disgusting


45
00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:22.710
What'd I tell you,
my man?


46
00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:55.499
Frank: You know,
I'm concerned for you, Mick


47
00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:58.444
I think maybe it's time for you
to get focused on something, you know?


48
00:03:58.513 --> 00:04:00.879
Maybe get a job

49
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.211
Dad, I got a job

50
00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.717
That ain't a job

51
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.184
That's an excuse
to avoid reality


52
00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:07.187
I think it's time you thought
about settling down,


53
00:04:07.255 --> 00:04:09.280
sinking your teeth
into something, you know?


54
00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:11.985
Something that'll give
your life some meaning


55
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.496
Now, I'm not saying you gotta go work
on Wall Street with this one,


56
00:04:15.564 --> 00:04:17.191
but how about
the fire department?


57
00:04:17.265 --> 00:04:18.698
Or a cop, you know?

58
00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:19.791
Something with
some benefits


59
00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:21.699
The way I see it
is this


60
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.204
Ever since
the hairy ass incident,


61
00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:26.763
it's like you've
been out of the game,


62
00:04:26.842 --> 00:04:29.276
you've been running
away from life,


63
00:04:29.344 --> 00:04:31.437
instead of running
towards it


64
00:04:31.513 --> 00:04:34.949
I think it's a good time
right now to turn around


65
00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:37.007
and start running
towards life again


66
00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:38.643
You know what
I'm talking about?


67
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.982
Can... Can I toss
this asshole overboard?


68
00:04:40.055 --> 00:04:41.215
Is that all right?

69
00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.415
Hey, don't get that way
with me, Mick!


70
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.515
I'm just trying to help

71
00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:45.025
Shut up, Francis

72
00:04:45.093 --> 00:04:47.061
But your sister's right

73
00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:48.595
You need something
with some stability


74
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.096
You know what, Dad?

75
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.496
I don't need
any stability


76
00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:54.865
because I'm happy
right where I am


77
00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:56.198
Big deal

78
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:57.602
You're happy

79
00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.697
You're never gonna
make any real money


80
00:04:59.774 --> 00:05:01.503
Who gives a shit?
I mean, look at you


81
00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:03.271
You make a pile of dough,
and you're miserable


82
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:05.074
What's that got to do
with anything?


83
00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:06.943
Hey, and I'm not
miserable, OK?


84
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:07.947
I'm dissatisfied

85
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.814
That's what
makes me a success


86
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.112
Now, Mickey

87
00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.450
there's something I've
been meaning to tell you


88
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:16.013
since you've been back

89
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:17.956
I think you did
the right thing


90
00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.891
The last thing you needed
to do was get married,


91
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:21.986
especially to that one

92
00:05:22.063 --> 00:05:24.190
The one thing
you gotta remember


93
00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:26.928
is this is your life,
not theirs


94
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:30.062
You gotta do what makes
you happy first, OK?


95
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.300
Taxi!

96
00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:39.942
[Whistle]

97
00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:41.448
Hey, what the hell?

98
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.355
JFK, please

99
00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:10.471
Hey, how you doin'?

100
00:06:10.545 --> 00:06:13.173
I'm... I'm good
I'm good


101
00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.681
What about you?

102
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.273
Where, um Where
are you flying to?


103
00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:17.283
New Orleans

104
00:06:17.352 --> 00:06:19.286
Oh, you on vacation
or something?


105
00:06:19.354 --> 00:06:22.118
No Actually, my best friend
from high school is getting married


106
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.317
It's kind of a funny story

107
00:06:24.392 --> 00:06:25.324
Oh, yeah?

108
00:06:25.393 --> 00:06:26.325
Yeah

109
00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:27.827
Her sink was clogged
a few weeks ago,


110
00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:29.830
So she called a plumber

111
00:06:29.898 --> 00:06:32.366
And this really nice guy
came over to fix it,


112
00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:36.598
and she ended up having sex
with him under the sink


113
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:38.332
So, now she's
gonna marry him


114
00:06:38.406 --> 00:06:40.499
This is your best friend
having sex under the sink?


115
00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:41.701
Mm-hmm

116
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.209
It's good to know

117
00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.973
So, what about you?
Are you married?


118
00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:46.707
Me? No

119
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.078
I mean I was engaged
once a couple of years ago,


120
00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.140
But it didn't pan out

121
00:06:50.218 --> 00:06:51.150
What happened?

122
00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:52.151
Nothing really

123
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.155
I just came home
early one night


124
00:06:55.223 --> 00:06:56.815
To find her and some guy passed out
on my living room floor,


125
00:06:56.891 --> 00:06:58.449
both of them
completely naked


126
00:06:58.526 --> 00:06:59.458
Oh, God

127
00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:01.461
Did you know the guy?

128
00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.225
No All I saw was his hairy ass
staring back at me


129
00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:07.325
But I think he may have been
a plumber, too, actually


130
00:07:07.402 --> 00:07:08.994
Well, what did you do?

131
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.594
You know,
nothing actually


132
00:07:10.672 --> 00:07:13.505
I walked out of the apartment,
got into my car,


133
00:07:13.575 --> 00:07:16.305
and spent the next three years
driving around the country


134
00:07:16.378 --> 00:07:18.312
Wow

135
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.281
Well, do you have
any regrets about it?


136
00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:23.283
Yeah Yeah, one

137
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:26.286
I should have taken my frigging TV
with me when I left


138
00:07:32.927 --> 00:07:35.225
How long would it take me
to drive to New Orleans?


139
00:07:35.296 --> 00:07:36.729
It's not that long

140
00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:37.730
It's like

141
00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:39.357
How much would
that cost?


142
00:07:39.434 --> 00:07:41.368
I don't know You could probably get
a pretty cheap rental car


143
00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:42.801
here at the airport

144
00:07:42.871 --> 00:07:44.805
Well, what if
you drove me?


145
00:07:44.873 --> 00:07:47.307
How much
would that be?


146
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:48.637
What do you mean?
If I drove you in my cab?


147
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.644
If I kept
the meter running,


148
00:07:50.712 --> 00:07:53.010
it would cost you, I don't know,
$70-80,000 maybe


149
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:54.514
$80,000

150
00:07:54.582 --> 00:07:57.517
Look, you could come
to my friend's wedding


151
00:07:57.585 --> 00:07:58.950
I'm allowed
to bring a date


152
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.453
Are you serious
about this?


153
00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:02.513
You want me to drive you
to New Orleans in my cab?


154
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.750
Yeah
Come on, please?


155
00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:05.019
It'll be fun

156
00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:06.583
I really don't
want to fly,


157
00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:09.323
and if I did and I died,
it would all be your fault


158
00:08:09.397 --> 00:08:11.524
And I don't think you want
to live with that guilt


159
00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.032
- My fault?
- Mm-hmm


160
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:14.159
Wait, wait, wait

161
00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:15.429
You tell me why
you're so afraid to fly,


162
00:08:15.503 --> 00:08:16.629
and then maybe
I'll consider it


163
00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:18.400
I don't like planes

164
00:08:23.311 --> 00:08:25.211
Hi, babe

165
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.212
Hey

166
00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.615
You busy?

167
00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:32.346
A little busy

168
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.948
Too busy to maybe,
I don't know, do it tonight?


169
00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:39.425
Do what, babe?

170
00:08:39.494 --> 00:08:40.927
Oh, I don't know,
Francis


171
00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:42.929
Why don't I take off
my clothes


172
00:08:42.997 --> 00:08:44.555
and you can do
whatever you'd like?


173
00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:49.332
Renee, come on
You know I've got to get this work done


174
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.998
How about a little
consideration, huh?


175
00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:55.065
Well, how about a little
consideration for me, huh?


176
00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:58.579
You know, we haven't
had sex for a while


177
00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:00.773
You know?

178
00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:02.214
All right,
listen OK


179
00:09:02.283 --> 00:09:04.717
If you're still up when
I have this finished,


180
00:09:04.786 --> 00:09:07.220
we'll do it, OK?

181
00:09:07.288 --> 00:09:09.620
You know, don't do me any favors,
all right there, Romeo?


182
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.683
I could just as easily go into
the bathroom and use my vibrator


183
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.696
That would be a little difficult,
wouldn't it, hon?


184
00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:18.164
Seeing as you don't
own a vibrator


185
00:09:18.233 --> 00:09:21.725
Babe, what's the big deal
with me owning a vibrator?


186
00:09:21.803 --> 00:09:25.864
No big deal
You just don't have one


187
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.568
OK Occasionally,
I need sex


188
00:09:28.643 --> 00:09:30.907
And for some reason,
I'm married to a man


189
00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:32.742
who doesn't like
to have sex anymore


190
00:09:32.814 --> 00:09:37.376
So from time to time, I like to
pleasure myself with a vibrator


191
00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.612
Deal with it

192
00:09:38.686 --> 00:09:40.620
Excuse me?
Pleasure yourself?


193
00:09:40.688 --> 00:09:42.246
That's rich

194
00:09:42.323 --> 00:09:44.985
And no, I'm not
gonna deal with it


195
00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:46.356
because you're my wife

196
00:09:46.427 --> 00:09:49.487
We have sex like normal people
in a bed lying down


197
00:09:49.564 --> 00:09:50.997
We don't run
to bathrooms


198
00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:52.498
and masturbate
like animals


199
00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:53.898
with any frigging
vibrators


200
00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.731
Ah, well, maybe
you don't, but I do


201
00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.738
So if you don't wake up
that libido of yours,


202
00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.296
I'm in that bathroom
in about 5 minutes


203
00:09:59.374 --> 00:10:00.636
Or, hey, better yet!

204
00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:04.906
I could go get it,
and we could play with it together


205
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.412
OK, very funny

206
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.642
Listen, let's get this straight
once and for all


207
00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:12.709
We do not have a vibrator
in this home


208
00:10:12.787 --> 00:10:13.719
[Loud Whistle]

209
00:10:13.788 --> 00:10:15.380
Do we?

210
00:10:15.456 --> 00:10:18.550
[Whistle]
Yo, Franny!


211
00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:20.287
Francis!

212
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:21.794
Better go see
who that is


213
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.733
Hey, Franny!
It's me, Mickey!


214
00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:32.796
I can see that
What the hell are you doing?


215
00:10:32.874 --> 00:10:34.808
You're not gonna
believe this


216
00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:39.142
I, uh
I got married


217
00:10:39.214 --> 00:10:40.408
Why don't you
let us up?


218
00:10:40.481 --> 00:10:41.743
I want you
to meet my wife


219
00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:45.547
What? Mickey! Congratulations!
When did this happen?


220
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.554
Let us up
I'll tell you all about it


221
00:10:47.622 --> 00:10:49.385
Yeah, hold on
a second, Mick


222
00:10:49.457 --> 00:10:51.391
He wants to come up

223
00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:52.391
Yeah, I heard

224
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.825
What's your problem?
Let them up!


225
00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:54.827
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

226
00:10:54.896 --> 00:10:56.056
I would like
to meet her!


227
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.427
Honey, it's late
You're not thinking straight


228
00:10:57.498 --> 00:10:59.363
Hey, Mick! We're glad you're living
such a romantic life


229
00:10:59.434 --> 00:11:01.368
The both of us, but, hey,
some people got some real jobs,


230
00:11:01.436 --> 00:11:03.301
You know, responsibilities
Catch you tomorrow


231
00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:06.636
Give me a call!
Congratulations, though!


232
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.073
Hey, fuck you,
you prick


233
00:11:08.142 --> 00:11:09.575
Come down and let us in

234
00:11:09.644 --> 00:11:12.636
Excus... I'm gonna let you into my home
in the middle of the night


235
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.147
after you don't invite
me to your wedding?


236
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.307
Mickey, don't
listen to him


237
00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.748
Of course,
you can come up,


238
00:11:16.818 --> 00:11:18.752
- And I'll send him down right now
- Excuse me?


239
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.617
What are you
talking about?


240
00:11:20.688 --> 00:11:22.622
I'm gonna let this man into my home
in the middle of the night


241
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.681
after he doesn't
invite me to his wedding?


242
00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.691
Oh, you're sick

243
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.694
Oh, I'm sick?
I'm sick?


244
00:11:27.762 --> 00:11:29.696
Hey, I'm not the one
with the vibrator, huh?


245
00:11:29.764 --> 00:11:31.197
Hey, listen, I find
that thing,


246
00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:32.927
I'm gonna mail it
to your mother


247
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:34.935
with a nice detailed letter
describing your perversions


248
00:11:35.003 --> 00:11:36.937
OK, you know what?
Go right ahead


249
00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:39.496
Who do you think got me the damn thing
in the first place?


250
00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.439
OK? She knows my pain

251
00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:47.314
Hope: Anyway, we were having
a great time together on the drive down,


252
00:11:47.382 --> 00:11:50.044
and I guess it was sometime after
we crossed into Kentucky


253
00:11:50.118 --> 00:11:52.177
that we fell in love

254
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.346
Then Mickey came with me
to my friend's wedding,


255
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.856
and when we were
dancing, he said,


256
00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.392
"It should have been us
who got married"


257
00:11:58.459 --> 00:11:59.892
And I mean,
I just ran over,


258
00:11:59.961 --> 00:12:01.485
I got the priest
out of the bar,


259
00:12:01.562 --> 00:12:03.928
pulled him onto
the dance floor,


260
00:12:03.998 --> 00:12:05.431
and he married us
right there


261
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.400
in the middle
of the reception


262
00:12:07.468 --> 00:12:09.663
Ohh Oh!

263
00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:11.705
I want to get
married like that


264
00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.206
Mickey, do you have
any other brothers


265
00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:14.434
that I just
don't know about?


266
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:15.441
Sorry, babe

267
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.102
Just Princess Kitty
over there


268
00:12:17.178 --> 00:12:18.577
I think you're
stuck with him


269
00:12:18.646 --> 00:12:20.341
That's it, huh?

270
00:12:20.415 --> 00:12:22.349
Is this true, Mick?

271
00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:24.351
What can I say, man?

272
00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:26.319
I'm about the love

273
00:12:26.387 --> 00:12:27.513
Obviously

274
00:12:27.588 --> 00:12:30.284
I had no idea you were
such an impetuous romantic


275
00:12:30.358 --> 00:12:33.225
I mean, that's a pretty impulsive move
you guys pulled


276
00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:35.353
But, I'm sorry, when
did you actually meet?


277
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.362
Wednesday

278
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:39.161
Ohh, today's Saturday

279
00:12:39.233 --> 00:12:42.691
OK, so you were married
without a best man when?


280
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.601
Thursday

281
00:12:44.672 --> 00:12:48.574
Oh, so you had a full 24 hours
to get to know each other then


282
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:49.575
Oh, Francis

283
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:50.872
No, I'm relieved, honey
Aren't you?


284
00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:53.004
I mean, I thought they might have
rushed into this


285
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:54.514
Watch yourself,
Francis, OK?


286
00:12:54.582 --> 00:12:57.016
Yeah You know what, you guys?
Don't listen to Francis


287
00:12:57.085 --> 00:12:59.451
He's about as impulsive
and romantic as a nun


288
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.953
In fact, you know
what, honey?


289
00:13:01.022 --> 00:13:03.149
I'm wondering why you actually
didn't become one


290
00:13:03.224 --> 00:13:04.657
So am I, honey

291
00:13:04.726 --> 00:13:07.456
You probably don't know your brother
as well as you think you do


292
00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:09.621
He's actually
very romantic


293
00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:13.995
I don't think we need to go there
right now Thank you


294
00:13:14.068 --> 00:13:16.366
Oh, no Let's go there,
by all means


295
00:13:16.437 --> 00:13:19.770
Sure Mr. Romantic
Mr. Summer Breeze


296
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.274
All about the Love

297
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:23.071
Of course you're right
What would I know?


298
00:13:23.144 --> 00:13:25.704
I'm just the brother
who wasn't the best man


299
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.010
Oh, Francis, you're gonna
have to get over this


300
00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:29.515
Nothing to get
over, hon


301
00:13:29.584 --> 00:13:31.017
I'm thrilled
Couldn't be more


302
00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:32.052
Congratulations, guys

303
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.849
Romance is wonderful
We all love it


304
00:13:33.921 --> 00:13:34.853
It brightens the day

305
00:13:34.922 --> 00:13:36.389
I just want
to remind you


306
00:13:36.457 --> 00:13:38.152
It don't pay the rent

307
00:13:38.226 --> 00:13:39.454
OK?

308
00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:43.054
Is he OK?

309
00:13:43.131 --> 00:13:45.497
Yeah He'll live

310
00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:49.695
(music) Now I'm walkin' (music)

311
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:54.674
(music) This street on my own (music)

312
00:13:54.742 --> 00:13:55.674
It's right here

313
00:13:55.743 --> 00:13:57.267
(music) But she's with me (music)

314
00:13:57.345 --> 00:13:58.778
This is the honeymoon
suite, huh?


315
00:13:58.846 --> 00:14:02.646
(music) Everywhere I go (music)

316
00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:07.416
(music) Here I found an angel (music)

317
00:14:07.488 --> 00:14:12.118
(music) I found my place (music)

318
00:14:12.193 --> 00:14:14.388
(music) I can only thank God (music)

319
00:14:14.462 --> 00:14:16.453
(music) It was not too late (music)

320
00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:18.795
(music) I can only thank God (music)

321
00:14:18.866 --> 00:14:20.766
(music) It was not too late (music)

322
00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:23.133
(music) I can only thank God (music)

323
00:14:23.204 --> 00:14:26.037
(music) It was not too late (music)

324
00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.015
What do you think's
going on?


325
00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.949
What is she, an illegal?
Pregnant? What?


326
00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:39.452
Maybe an illegal

327
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.010
She looks like she's
from one of the islands


328
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:44.058
Yeah I was thinking
the same thing


329
00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:46.059
You know, I'm concerned
for him, Francis


330
00:14:46.127 --> 00:14:48.027
You think it'll last?

331
00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.859
No shot
You kidding me?


332
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.422
Poor kid

333
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.933
Never used up here

334
00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:56.834
Always used in here

335
00:14:56.904 --> 00:14:58.201
Just like your mother

336
00:14:59.907 --> 00:15:02.774
I tell ya, I just
can't believe


337
00:15:02.844 --> 00:15:04.675
He did it
without me, frankly


338
00:15:04.745 --> 00:15:05.939
I should have
been there


339
00:15:06.013 --> 00:15:07.344
I should have been
his best man


340
00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:08.848
He was my best man

341
00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:10.349
So, just for
the record,


342
00:15:10.418 --> 00:15:12.010
it is bad luck to have
a wedding without a best man


343
00:15:12.086 --> 00:15:14.855
Jeez, you're not crying,
are you, Francis?


344
00:15:14.988 --> 00:15:17.320
No, no, no! I am not interested
in what they had to say!


345
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.483
I am interested in you doing
what you're told!


346
00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:21.049
Now, when you've done that,
call me ba...


347
00:15:21.127 --> 00:15:22.856
No!
Have Ryan call me!


348
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:26.028
[Intercom Beeps]

349
00:15:26.099 --> 00:15:28.158
Secretary: Mr. Fitzpatrick,
I have Miss Davis on the phone


350
00:15:28.235 --> 00:15:29.759
Yeah, yeah
Put her through


351
00:15:29.836 --> 00:15:32.168
Heather?

352
00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:33.171
Are you OK?

353
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.172
I called the office
this morning,


354
00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:35.208
they said you
called in sick


355
00:15:35.275 --> 00:15:37.209
I call the apartment,
you're not there


356
00:15:37.277 --> 00:15:38.209
Are you all right?

357
00:15:38.278 --> 00:15:40.542
Yeah I'm fine

358
00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:41.808
How's work?

359
00:15:41.882 --> 00:15:43.713
Work's fine
Where are you?


360
00:15:43.783 --> 00:15:46.752
I'm at Papa's

361
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.185
Who the hell is Papa?

362
00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:51.588
Come on, Franny
You know my friend Papa


363
00:15:51.658 --> 00:15:53.751
Oh, Oh, you mean
Carl the old guy


364
00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:55.852
Listen, I thought we agreed
we were gonna call him


365
00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:59.763
Carl the Diaper-Wearing Geriatric,
not Papa


366
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:00.891
What the hell are
you doing there?


367
00:16:00.967 --> 00:16:02.798
I slept over here
last night


368
00:16:02.869 --> 00:16:04.302
with him

369
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:08.307
You mean, you slept with him
as in had actual


370
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:11.037
sexual intercourse
with this... this animal?


371
00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:12.544
Amongst other things

372
00:16:12.612 --> 00:16:13.977
That's not funny

373
00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:15.878
He's older than your father,
for God's sakes


374
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:17.678
Francis,
my father's dead


375
00:16:17.751 --> 00:16:19.878
My point exactly,
thank you


376
00:16:19.953 --> 00:16:22.114
This is very...
This is very upsetting


377
00:16:22.188 --> 00:16:23.621
I think it's
extremely important


378
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.123
that I see you
as soon as possible


379
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:29.093
so I can show you
the error of your ways here


380
00:16:29.162 --> 00:16:31.858
Well, he's gonna
be gone all day long


381
00:16:31.932 --> 00:16:34.730
You could come over
to his place if you want


382
00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:38.328
I'm afraid I, uh,
still have my pride, darling


383
00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:41.340
I'm not gonna meet you at this
old fucker's apartment, OK?


384
00:16:41.408 --> 00:16:45.742
Well I guess you won't
see me today then, will you?


385
00:16:50.083 --> 00:16:52.017
OK

386
00:16:52.085 --> 00:16:53.985
What's the address?

387
00:16:58.925 --> 00:17:01.985
Well, I hope that cleared
things up for you, hon


388
00:17:04.664 --> 00:17:05.596
What?

389
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.069
Excuse me, don't even
try to tell me


390
00:17:10.136 --> 00:17:12.604
sex with Grandpa
was better than with me


391
00:17:12.672 --> 00:17:16.005
You're not in competition
with him, Francis


392
00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:18.010
Besides, one wasn't better
than the other


393
00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:20.945
They were just
different


394
00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:23.414
They'd better damn well be
different


395
00:17:23.483 --> 00:17:25.417
He's an old man
who can't control his bladder


396
00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:26.884
and has to wear diapers,

397
00:17:26.953 --> 00:17:29.444
and I'm a young stallion
in the prime of my youth


398
00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:32.783
But how was it different?

399
00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:35.123
Just different
Forget I said anything


400
00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:36.628
No, no
Elaborate


401
00:17:36.696 --> 00:17:41.030
I think it might be enlightening
to understand how


402
00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:44.093
sex might be different
with a fossil


403
00:17:45.905 --> 00:17:47.566
OK, but don't get
mad, all right?


404
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.572
I won't

405
00:17:50.777 --> 00:17:52.506
I faked my orgasm
with you


406
00:17:55.048 --> 00:17:56.276
So?

407
00:17:56.349 --> 00:17:59.318
I didn't have to
with Papa


408
00:18:03.023 --> 00:18:04.854
I gotcha

409
00:18:04.924 --> 00:18:07.358
Come on, Francis
Don't be mad


410
00:18:07.427 --> 00:18:09.361
You wanted to know

411
00:18:09.429 --> 00:18:12.455
No, l... I really
didn't, hon


412
00:18:12.532 --> 00:18:15.592
Don't pull this jealous
bullshit with me, OK?


413
00:18:15.668 --> 00:18:17.727
I can sleep with
whomever I want


414
00:18:17.804 --> 00:18:19.567
Remember? I'm not
the one that's married


415
00:18:19.639 --> 00:18:20.663
You are

416
00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:24.404
You really had
an orgasm with him?


417
00:18:28.214 --> 00:18:31.047
Pardon my asking, Tom,
but how old are you?


418
00:18:31.117 --> 00:18:32.379
68

419
00:18:32.452 --> 00:18:34.886
You know, I was
just wondering,


420
00:18:34.954 --> 00:18:37.514
more out of curiosity
than anything,


421
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:45.053
if a guy your age
can still have sex


422
00:18:45.131 --> 00:18:47.429
Only when the wife
gives me the OK


423
00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:52.438
So, you can still perform
then if she says so?


424
00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:53.437
Sure

425
00:18:53.506 --> 00:18:54.939
As a matter of fact,
my wife tells me


426
00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:57.602
I'm better now than
when I was in my 20s


427
00:18:59.646 --> 00:19:00.670
Great

428
00:19:01.881 --> 00:19:03.280
That's terrific, Tom

429
00:19:04.584 --> 00:19:07.451
Hey, so, um, this
apartment of ours,


430
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.044
how long have
you lived there?


431
00:19:09.122 --> 00:19:11.522
Almost two years
Isn't it great?


432
00:19:11.591 --> 00:19:13.024
Yeah, it is
It is


433
00:19:13.093 --> 00:19:14.560
It's a little small though,
you know?


434
00:19:14.627 --> 00:19:16.060
But it's cozy

435
00:19:16.129 --> 00:19:17.289
- Cozy?
- Yeah


436
00:19:17.363 --> 00:19:18.796
You know,
it's funny


437
00:19:18.865 --> 00:19:20.093
When I took a shower
this morning, though,


438
00:19:20.166 --> 00:19:22.191
there was no hot water
so I wasn't too cozy


439
00:19:22.268 --> 00:19:23.997
Oh, yeah
I forgot to tell you


440
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.970
We never have hot water
on the weekends


441
00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.631
Really? Great

442
00:19:27.707 --> 00:19:30.904
You know, there's a big hole
in the ceiling in the bathroom, too,


443
00:19:30.977 --> 00:19:32.638
because this morning,
it was funny,


444
00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:34.475
I was brushing my teeth, I had
a nice view up some guy's boxer shorts


445
00:19:34.547 --> 00:19:35.912
That was real nice

446
00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:37.449
That's Jim
You'll have to meet him


447
00:19:37.517 --> 00:19:38.677
He's a good guy

448
00:19:38.751 --> 00:19:40.685
Oh, is he? Yeah?
Jim's a good guy? Good Good


449
00:19:40.753 --> 00:19:42.948
Well, I guess if I'm gonna be
looking at his pecker every morning,


450
00:19:43.022 --> 00:19:44.649
he may as well
be a good guy


451
00:19:44.724 --> 00:19:47.056
I better get going
This is where I work


452
00:19:47.127 --> 00:19:50.187
Yeah?
Right here, huh?


453
00:19:50.263 --> 00:19:52.697
You know, it looks actually
like it might get


454
00:19:52.765 --> 00:19:53.959
a little chilly
in there,


455
00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:56.399
seeing as you're standing here
practically naked


456
00:19:56.469 --> 00:20:00.337
I could run home, you know,
and get you a nice big down jacket


457
00:20:00.406 --> 00:20:02.237
or a sweatsuit
or something, you know?


458
00:20:02.308 --> 00:20:03.502
'Cause that might help

459
00:20:03.576 --> 00:20:05.737
I don't think so

460
00:20:05.812 --> 00:20:07.245
I'll see you later

461
00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:08.245
Bye

462
00:20:08.314 --> 00:20:09.804
All right
Take it easy


463
00:20:09.883 --> 00:20:11.111
Bye

464
00:20:11.184 --> 00:20:13.812
Hey, babe
What's up?


465
00:20:13.887 --> 00:20:14.876
Was that him?

466
00:20:14.954 --> 00:20:16.945
Cute, huh?

467
00:20:17.023 --> 00:20:18.251
I don't know

468
00:20:18.324 --> 00:20:20.224
I mean, I thought he kinda looked
like a real jerk


469
00:20:20.293 --> 00:20:21.385
Well, thanks, Connie

470
00:20:21.461 --> 00:20:22.553
That's real sweet of you

471
00:20:22.629 --> 00:20:23.653
No, I'm sorry

472
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.163
I know,
I mean, he's probably...


473
00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:28.667
He's probably a really,
really, really, nice guy


474
00:20:28.735 --> 00:20:30.669
I don't know

475
00:20:30.737 --> 00:20:32.466
Did you have
to marry him?


476
00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:34.166
Absolutely

477
00:20:36.009 --> 00:20:39.103
So I guess you're gonna go to Paris
with him instead of me then


478
00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:42.671
Well, we really haven't discussed
that yet, but


479
00:20:42.749 --> 00:20:45.684
Does... Oh Oh, well,
it's nice to see


480
00:20:45.752 --> 00:20:48.186
you're being upfront
and honest


481
00:20:48.254 --> 00:20:49.414
at the start of the relationship
That's good


482
00:20:49.489 --> 00:20:51.423
Hey, I've only
known him a week


483
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:53.220
I haven't had a chance to tell him
my life story yet, all right?


484
00:20:53.293 --> 00:20:54.260
Gimme a break

485
00:20:54.327 --> 00:20:56.818
No No, I understand
I understand


486
00:20:56.896 --> 00:20:58.625
However, it'll just be
interesting to see


487
00:20:58.698 --> 00:20:59.722
how a cabdriver
from Brooklyn


488
00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:01.699
feels about moving to Paris,
that's all


489
00:21:01.768 --> 00:21:04.293
I mean, he'll probably
be fine with it


490
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.635
No big deal He'll just move
to Paris with you


491
00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:10.904
It'll never last
Believe me


492
00:21:10.977 --> 00:21:13.138
Nightmare when they get
to know each other


493
00:21:13.213 --> 00:21:15.647
Maybe they were
made for each other


494
00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:17.376
Those things
can happen, you know


495
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.715
Carol and I met right here
at the beach club in 1963 by the pool


496
00:21:20.787 --> 00:21:21.719
That's right

497
00:21:21.788 --> 00:21:22.777
On a Friday morning

498
00:21:22.855 --> 00:21:25.187
By Saturday night,
I had her in the dunes


499
00:21:25.258 --> 00:21:27.158
- Oh, Jesus!
- Carol: Jesus, Ron!


500
00:21:27.227 --> 00:21:29.286
They don't want to
hear all the details!


501
00:21:29.362 --> 00:21:30.294
Come on

502
00:21:30.363 --> 00:21:31.489
We've been together
ever since


503
00:21:31.564 --> 00:21:32.622
There's something
to be said for that


504
00:21:32.699 --> 00:21:35.167
All right! All right!
Enough about the dunes!


505
00:21:35.235 --> 00:21:36.668
So, what's going on,
Franny?


506
00:21:36.736 --> 00:21:38.294
How are things
down on Wall Street?


507
00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:40.032
- Things are good
- Things are good?


508
00:21:40.106 --> 00:21:42.540
You're a 25-year-old kid,
you make a half a mil a year


509
00:21:42.609 --> 00:21:44.440
I'd say things
are better than good


510
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.444
I hate to spoil
the illusion, Ron,


511
00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:48.844
but I don't make
that kind of money


512
00:21:48.915 --> 00:21:49.847
Oh

513
00:21:49.916 --> 00:21:51.850
Oh, Francis, do me
a favor, please?


514
00:21:51.918 --> 00:21:53.943
Don't bullshit
a bullshitter, OK?


515
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.544
And by the way,
it's been a while


516
00:21:55.622 --> 00:21:58.284
since you gave your favorite
father-in-law a nice inside tip


517
00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:00.189
Yeah, and when are you
going to set me up


518
00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.750
with some of
your rich friends?


519
00:22:01.828 --> 00:22:03.193
Excuse me, you guys

520
00:22:03.263 --> 00:22:04.855
My husband has
some ethics, OK?


521
00:22:04.931 --> 00:22:07.525
He's not some sort
of cheating sleazebag


522
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.658
Right, babe?

523
00:22:08.735 --> 00:22:09.861
What's the matter?

524
00:22:09.936 --> 00:22:11.233
You don't want to share
the wealth anymore, kid?


525
00:22:11.304 --> 00:22:13.363
It's not the only thing
he don't want to share anymore


526
00:22:13.439 --> 00:22:14.337
Mom, would you please?

527
00:22:14.407 --> 00:22:15.533
Carol: What? What?

528
00:22:15.608 --> 00:22:18.577
You getting greedy
in your old age, Fran? Huh?


529
00:22:18.645 --> 00:22:21.580
You know, it's really nice to come out
here and see you guys on the weekends


530
00:22:21.648 --> 00:22:23.240
I mean, it's a wonder
we don't do it more often


531
00:22:23.316 --> 00:22:24.977
- Honey!
- Hey! Hey!


532
00:22:25.051 --> 00:22:27.576
Don't be getting sarcastic
on us, young lady


533
00:22:27.654 --> 00:22:29.053
We're your parents,

534
00:22:29.122 --> 00:22:31.556
and therefore, you're in
no position to approve or disapprove


535
00:22:31.624 --> 00:22:33.888
of what we say or do,
you understand?


536
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.325
Carol: Right!
He's right, right, right!


537
00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:36.521
Really? Really?

538
00:22:36.596 --> 00:22:38.325
Well, my analyst is just
going to have a field day


539
00:22:38.398 --> 00:22:40.161
with that little bit
of psychosis


540
00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:42.201
If you two lunatics
will excuse me,


541
00:22:42.268 --> 00:22:44.395
I'm gonna go play
some tennis


542
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.571
Her analyst?

543
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:50.802
[Sighs]
Don't ask


544
00:22:50.877 --> 00:22:52.811
Macrocom

545
00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:54.540
I'll call you Monday

546
00:23:32.018 --> 00:23:33.349
Hey, babe

547
00:23:33.419 --> 00:23:34.818
I'm gonna go to work
now, all right?


548
00:23:34.887 --> 00:23:37.219
OK You love me?

549
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.952
Yeah Yeah
Of course I do


550
00:23:40.026 --> 00:23:42.494
Good, 'cause
I love you


551
00:23:42.562 --> 00:23:43.494
Bye

552
00:23:43.563 --> 00:23:45.394
All right
Take care


553
00:23:55.007 --> 00:23:56.440
Thanks a lot

554
00:24:01.447 --> 00:24:03.711
75th and Madison,
please


555
00:24:10.256 --> 00:24:12.884
So, 75th and
Madison, huh?


556
00:24:12.959 --> 00:24:15.086
That's a pretty
swanky address


557
00:24:15.161 --> 00:24:16.924
Excuse me?

558
00:24:19.766 --> 00:24:21.631
My God Mickey?

559
00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:22.633
Yep

560
00:24:22.702 --> 00:24:24.693
What are you doing?

561
00:24:24.771 --> 00:24:26.705
I'm... I'm in shock
is what I'm doing


562
00:24:26.773 --> 00:24:27.831
What are you doing?

563
00:24:27.907 --> 00:24:29.340
I'm going home

564
00:24:29.409 --> 00:24:33.869
What about you?
How you been?


565
00:24:33.946 --> 00:24:35.675
You know,
I've been good


566
00:24:37.049 --> 00:24:38.482
Good

567
00:24:38.551 --> 00:24:40.781
Everything's all right?

568
00:24:40.853 --> 00:24:43.287
Yeah Yeah
Everything's fine


569
00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:44.789
So, what about you?

570
00:24:44.857 --> 00:24:47.655
You look like you must finally
be making some decent money


571
00:24:47.727 --> 00:24:50.161
You know Still on
Wall Street


572
00:24:50.229 --> 00:24:52.288
Not making as much
money as I'd like


573
00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:56.199
Yeah, well, you were
never easy to please, right?


574
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:58.897
So, you know,
you married yet?


575
00:24:58.971 --> 00:25:02.031
No He hasn't
asked just yet


576
00:25:02.108 --> 00:25:03.473
Oh, really, huh?

577
00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:06.637
Not that hairy ape who was
sprawled out on my carpet, I hope


578
00:25:08.948 --> 00:25:11.075
No Not him

579
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.710
Yeah, well, I can't
say I blame you


580
00:25:13.786 --> 00:25:15.583
I mean, from what I did see of him,
he wasn't too pretty


581
00:25:15.655 --> 00:25:18.317
A little on
the furry side


582
00:25:18.391 --> 00:25:19.688
So, who's the prospective husband?

583
00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:20.691
Anybody I know?

584
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.194
No I don't think so

585
00:25:23.262 --> 00:25:25.822
He and his friends
have real jobs


586
00:25:25.898 --> 00:25:27.092
Yeah Right

587
00:25:27.166 --> 00:25:29.828
From anyone else,
I would take that as an insult,


588
00:25:29.902 --> 00:25:32.837
But, you know,
you seem to forget the fact


589
00:25:32.905 --> 00:25:35.567
that I know how you put
yourself through college


590
00:25:36.843 --> 00:25:39.471
Somebody had to pay for
my education, sweetheart


591
00:25:44.116 --> 00:25:45.947
Had to bring
that up, right?


592
00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:49.788
An eye for an eye

593
00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:55.660
OK, I've
made up my mind


594
00:25:55.728 --> 00:25:57.355
I can't go
through with this


595
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.022
If you're gonna
take the television,


596
00:25:59.098 --> 00:26:00.531
I think
it's only fair


597
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.465
that you give me
back the watch


598
00:26:02.535 --> 00:26:05.470
I mean, it is the watch
I gave you, right?


599
00:26:05.538 --> 00:26:06.800
Yeah Yeah it is

600
00:26:06.873 --> 00:26:10.138
But, uh, like you said,
the watch was a gift,


601
00:26:10.209 --> 00:26:11.801
and the TV wasn’t

602
00:26:11.878 --> 00:26:14.039
If I recall correctly,

603
00:26:14.113 --> 00:26:16.707
I did pay for part
of the television


604
00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:18.374
I mean, it's not like

605
00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:20.715
you could afford it
on your own


606
00:26:20.786 --> 00:26:21.718
OK

607
00:26:23.589 --> 00:26:27.025
You want the watch?
You can have the watch


608
00:26:27.093 --> 00:26:29.994
Doesn't really mean
that much to me anyhow


609
00:26:30.062 --> 00:26:32.553
It's not the watch
I want, Mickey


610
00:26:32.632 --> 00:26:33.656
Yeah

611
00:26:33.733 --> 00:26:34.995
Why don't we just

612
00:26:35.067 --> 00:26:37.331
give that a break
already, OK, Heather?


613
00:26:37.403 --> 00:26:38.665
Give it a break

614
00:26:38.738 --> 00:26:40.865
You mean to tell me
that you actually


615
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.532
came up here
for the television?


616
00:26:42.608 --> 00:26:43.870
Yeah Yeah, I did

617
00:26:43.943 --> 00:26:46.537
Why do you think
I came up here?


618
00:26:46.612 --> 00:26:48.842
You are so full of shit

619
00:26:48.915 --> 00:26:51.076
Yeah? How do you
figure that?


620
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:55.086
You can honestly say that
you don't ever think of me anymore?


621
00:26:57.189 --> 00:27:00.283
Yeah, sure Of course,
you know, I think about you


622
00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:01.656
I think, you know,

623
00:27:01.727 --> 00:27:03.752
what could have
possibly possessed you


624
00:27:03.829 --> 00:27:06.423
to take that dirtbag
home to my apartment


625
00:27:08.868 --> 00:27:10.358
Come on, Mickey

626
00:27:10.436 --> 00:27:13.371
We both knew the relationship
was over before that


627
00:27:13.439 --> 00:27:15.100
I wanted a career,
and you wanted


628
00:27:15.174 --> 00:27:16.766
Who the hell knows
what you wanted?


629
00:27:16.842 --> 00:27:18.275
Did you ever
figure that out?


630
00:27:18.344 --> 00:27:21.313
Yeah, you know what,
as a matter of fact, I did


631
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.644
Oh, that's right
Your brother told me


632
00:27:23.716 --> 00:27:24.910
You got married

633
00:27:28.287 --> 00:27:30.221
What do you mean,
"my brother"?


634
00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:32.553
Since when do you
speak to Francis?


635
00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:35.617
Well, you know, he and his friends
have real jobs,


636
00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:37.788
So occasionally
I run into him


637
00:27:37.863 --> 00:27:39.797
Yeah, well,
you know, it's, uh,


638
00:27:39.865 --> 00:27:41.730
it's a shame
he's married


639
00:27:41.801 --> 00:27:44.065
You two probably
would have hit it off


640
00:27:44.136 --> 00:27:46.400
Maybe Anyhow, I'm just
sorry that, you know,


641
00:27:46.472 --> 00:27:48.838
you had to find out
the way that you did


642
00:27:48.908 --> 00:27:51.172
I would have liked
to have been friends


643
00:27:51.243 --> 00:27:52.801
Friends?
Really? Yeah


644
00:27:52.878 --> 00:27:54.505
Well, you know what, Heather?

645
00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.979
I don't think that
would have worked, actually,


646
00:27:56.048 --> 00:27:57.515
Because, see,
I got this thing


647
00:27:57.583 --> 00:27:59.517
And, uh, I try
and keep the number


648
00:27:59.585 --> 00:28:02.418
of friends who, like,
lie and cheat to me to a minimum


649
00:28:02.488 --> 00:28:03.785
Please, Mickey

650
00:28:03.856 --> 00:28:05.790
Put your fucking sanctimonious
bullshit to rest already


651
00:28:05.858 --> 00:28:06.825
Hey, I'm sorry

652
00:28:06.892 --> 00:28:08.291
I guess that fact,
that, you know, um,


653
00:28:08.361 --> 00:28:10.295
I've always tried to behave like
a decent human being


654
00:28:10.363 --> 00:28:11.921
has rubbed you
the wrong way, hasn't it?


655
00:28:11.998 --> 00:28:14.262
Yeah, but look where
your decency's gotten you


656
00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:16.324
You're the only
English-speaking white guy


657
00:28:16.402 --> 00:28:18.336
driving a cab
in New York


658
00:28:18.404 --> 00:28:19.996
That should
tell you something


659
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.042
You know what, Heather?

660
00:28:29.115 --> 00:28:30.377
I've got to imagine

661
00:28:30.449 --> 00:28:32.349
it beats sucking dick
for a living, though, huh?


662
00:28:33.953 --> 00:28:35.887
Depends on
whose dick it is


663
00:28:45.564 --> 00:28:46.496
Hey, Jim

664
00:28:46.565 --> 00:28:48.089
Hello, Mick

665
00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:49.429
How you hanging, man?

666
00:28:49.502 --> 00:28:50.764
Hanging fine
Thanks, Mick


667
00:28:51.837 --> 00:28:53.771
[Baby Crying]

668
00:29:08.087 --> 00:29:08.985
Oh, hey, babe

669
00:29:09.055 --> 00:29:10.113
Hey

670
00:29:10.189 --> 00:29:12.419
Frigging hot in here today
What happened?


671
00:29:12.491 --> 00:29:13.423
Yeah I know

672
00:29:13.492 --> 00:29:15.483
We lost our
electricity again, so


673
00:29:15.561 --> 00:29:16.823
Oh, really?
Again? Great


674
00:29:16.896 --> 00:29:19.831
You know, I really love this place
It's great


675
00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:22.595
Just grab a beer
if you want to cool off


676
00:29:22.668 --> 00:29:24.602
Well, you know what,
Hope? L...


677
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.161
I don't mean to point out
the obvious,


678
00:29:27.239 --> 00:29:29.503
but, uh, usually the fridge
doesn't work


679
00:29:29.575 --> 00:29:31.167
if there's no
electricity


680
00:29:32.244 --> 00:29:33.176
How is it?

681
00:29:33.245 --> 00:29:34.507
It's good
It's really good


682
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.674
It's got a nice warm-piss quality
to it, you know?


683
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.014
Oh, you're
in a good mood, huh?


684
00:29:40.086 --> 00:29:41.678
So what's with the TV?

685
00:29:41.754 --> 00:29:43.346
Oh, yeah
You like it?


686
00:29:43.422 --> 00:29:45.356
I figured we needed a TV

687
00:29:45.424 --> 00:29:47.016
Yeah, I know
It's fine,


688
00:29:47.093 --> 00:29:48.685
but where'd you get it?

689
00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:51.457
I, um, it's funny
you should ask


690
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:55.227
l... I picked up uh, Heather
in my cab today


691
00:29:55.301 --> 00:29:57.895
And I told you
she had the TV,


692
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.939
so, you know, basically I told her
I wanted my TV back


693
00:30:01.006 --> 00:30:01.938
Oh, really?

694
00:30:02.007 --> 00:30:03.269
And then what happened?

695
00:30:03.342 --> 00:30:05.276
Well, I went
to her apartment,


696
00:30:05.344 --> 00:30:08.279
I got the TV,
and I carried it out


697
00:30:08.347 --> 00:30:11.316
You were up in your ex-fiancee's
apartment today?


698
00:30:11.383 --> 00:30:12.315
How was that?

699
00:30:12.384 --> 00:30:13.715
Was it fun?

700
00:30:13.786 --> 00:30:15.378
What are
you doing, huh?


701
00:30:15.454 --> 00:30:18.287
I went up there
for the TV That's it


702
00:30:18.357 --> 00:30:19.949
Are you mad at me?

703
00:30:20.025 --> 00:30:20.957
No

704
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:23.995
Hey, come on,
Hope, all right?


705
00:30:24.063 --> 00:30:25.121
I mean, enough

706
00:30:26.198 --> 00:30:27.563
Hey Hey

707
00:30:27.633 --> 00:30:31.364
You know, if there's one thing
you don't have to worry about,


708
00:30:31.437 --> 00:30:32.699
it's that, all right?

709
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:37.706
Yeah I know

710
00:30:39.145 --> 00:30:42.239
I'm allowed to get a little jealous
sometimes, aren't I?


711
00:30:42.314 --> 00:30:44.680
No No I'm...
I'm a good guy


712
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.739
Yeah, right

713
00:30:45.818 --> 00:30:48.810
I've heard that
song and dance before


714
00:30:48.888 --> 00:30:50.253
So

715
00:30:50.322 --> 00:30:53.314
she have a nicer
apartment than us?


716
00:30:53.392 --> 00:30:54.825
Well, you know,

717
00:30:54.894 --> 00:30:58.261
she's got electricity, so that's,
you know, that's kind of nice


718
00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.592
I'm jealous of them

719
00:30:59.665 --> 00:31:00.597
Don't be Please

720
00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:02.099
Listen,
he's a cab driver


721
00:31:02.168 --> 00:31:03.533
She's a waitress

722
00:31:03.602 --> 00:31:06.469
They live in a fourth-floor walk-up
with no electricity, OK?


723
00:31:06.539 --> 00:31:07.972
Yeah, but do you see

724
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.871
how they're always
all over one another?


725
00:31:09.942 --> 00:31:11.773
Bet they have sex
all the time


726
00:31:11.844 --> 00:31:13.778
Does he ever tell you
stuff like that?


727
00:31:13.846 --> 00:31:16.713
What? Granted, this man is my brother,
but I do not ask him


728
00:31:16.782 --> 00:31:18.716
how often he's having sex
with his girl


729
00:31:18.784 --> 00:31:21.150
I mean, what kind
of numbers we talking?


730
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.152
Like five, six?

731
00:31:22.221 --> 00:31:23.620
Seven times a day?

732
00:31:23.689 --> 00:31:26.214
Listen, I'm not telling
you anything, OK?


733
00:31:26.292 --> 00:31:27.589
Bet it's a lot

734
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.185
Remember how much
we used to do it


735
00:31:30.262 --> 00:31:31.854
when we first got married?

736
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:33.330
Yeah, sure

737
00:31:33.399 --> 00:31:36.300
But, honey, you know everyone's
like that when they first meet


738
00:31:36.368 --> 00:31:38.632
Then you get into a groove
You slow down


739
00:31:38.704 --> 00:31:41.172
It would be impossible to keep up
that level of intensity


740
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.673
for an extended
period of time


741
00:31:42.741 --> 00:31:44.003
I mean, you'd
hurt yourself


742
00:31:44.076 --> 00:31:46.670
That's why your back's
all fucked up, huh?


743
00:31:46.745 --> 00:31:49.236
You're doing her,
what, around the clock?


744
00:31:49.315 --> 00:31:51.909
What kind of sick
degenerate are you, OK?


745
00:31:51.984 --> 00:31:54.248
This is my wife
you're talking about


746
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.811
I think we have a problem
with our sex life


747
00:31:56.889 --> 00:31:58.356
Listen, no, we don't

748
00:31:58.424 --> 00:32:00.756
Unlike those two animals, we have
real jobs and responsibilities


749
00:32:00.826 --> 00:32:03.192
We don't have all day
to rub up against each other


750
00:32:03.262 --> 00:32:05.196
Our sex life is fine,
believe me


751
00:32:05.264 --> 00:32:07.858
Francis, I cannot remember
the last time


752
00:32:07.933 --> 00:32:09.195
I saw your penis

753
00:32:09.268 --> 00:32:10.462
What? Excuse me

754
00:32:10.536 --> 00:32:12.163
What kind of language
is that?


755
00:32:12.238 --> 00:32:13.830
We're in a
public street here


756
00:32:13.906 --> 00:32:15.498
Maybe we should get
some of those


757
00:32:15.574 --> 00:32:17.007
sex improvement
tapes, you know?


758
00:32:17.076 --> 00:32:18.839
Or I could get
some of that stuff


759
00:32:18.911 --> 00:32:19.843
from Victoria's Secret

760
00:32:19.912 --> 00:32:20.901
Maybe that would help

761
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.777
Honey, would you stop
talking about this


762
00:32:22.848 --> 00:32:24.440
'cause you're
depressing me, OK?


763
00:32:24.516 --> 00:32:26.484
I told you, it's...

764
00:32:26.552 --> 00:32:29.385
It's a down cycle,
that's... that's all


765
00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:31.218
What?

766
00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.656
You're not familiar
with the down cycle?


767
00:32:33.726 --> 00:32:34.658
No No No

768
00:32:34.727 --> 00:32:36.661
Wh-What exactly
is the, uh,


769
00:32:36.729 --> 00:32:37.889
the down cycle?

770
00:32:37.963 --> 00:32:39.624
You know,
in a relationship


771
00:32:39.698 --> 00:32:41.962
you got ups, downs

772
00:32:42.034 --> 00:32:44.298
Sometimes you
do it a lot...


773
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.962
you know,
like you're doing


774
00:32:46.038 --> 00:32:48.666
Other times, you know,
Not at all


775
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:50.868
Ups and downs

776
00:32:50.943 --> 00:32:51.875
Down cycle

777
00:32:53.479 --> 00:32:55.071
I feel for you, man

778
00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:57.206
You're a... You're
a sick individual,


779
00:32:57.283 --> 00:32:58.773
and you need help

780
00:32:58.884 --> 00:33:00.749
Well, you know, I think
maybe we should talk


781
00:33:00.819 --> 00:33:02.081
about our
apartment situation


782
00:33:02.154 --> 00:33:04.019
Why? You don't
like our apartment?


783
00:33:04.089 --> 00:33:06.057
No, no, no
It's not that at all


784
00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:07.422
I mean,
I like the fact


785
00:33:07.493 --> 00:33:09.427
that we never have
electricity and hot water,


786
00:33:09.495 --> 00:33:11.156
and, I mean, I love
the pink walls, you know that


787
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.162
I'm just thinking

788
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:13.562
I don't know, maybe it's,

789
00:33:13.632 --> 00:33:15.566
like, maybe a little too small
for two people


790
00:33:15.634 --> 00:33:17.226
Yeah, I know,
but there's a chance


791
00:33:17.303 --> 00:33:18.895
we'll only be there
another month,


792
00:33:18.971 --> 00:33:20.905
and then we might be
moving to Paris


793
00:33:20.973 --> 00:33:22.065
Whoa, whoa, whoa

794
00:33:22.141 --> 00:33:24.473
What do you mean
we might be moving to Paris?


795
00:33:24.543 --> 00:33:26.477
Why would we ever
move to Paris?


796
00:33:26.545 --> 00:33:28.843
'Cause I might be going to school
there in the fall


797
00:33:28.914 --> 00:33:31.883
- This is Paris, France,
you're talking about?
- Yeah


798
00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:34.351
The... The country in Europe
where they hate Americans?


799
00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.048
That's not true
They just don't like stupid Americans


800
00:33:37.122 --> 00:33:38.714
You know, Hope,
I think unfortunately


801
00:33:38.791 --> 00:33:40.383
I would probably fall
into that category,


802
00:33:40.459 --> 00:33:42.393
so, wh-when do we
find out about this?


803
00:33:42.461 --> 00:33:44.088
I mean, this is
a fairly important


804
00:33:44.163 --> 00:33:45.755
development in our life,
don't you think?


805
00:33:45.831 --> 00:33:48.095
I should find out
if I get in this week


806
00:33:48.167 --> 00:33:49.759
Really? That's great
Great Terrific


807
00:33:49.835 --> 00:33:52.303
You know, thanks
for letting me in on this


808
00:33:52.371 --> 00:33:53.861
I, uh, I really
appreciate it


809
00:33:53.939 --> 00:33:55.907
You know, Mick, maybe
your brother's right


810
00:33:55.975 --> 00:33:57.909
This would be
the perfect time


811
00:33:57.977 --> 00:33:59.911
for you to run
towards life


812
00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:04.540
You think this
is something


813
00:34:04.616 --> 00:34:06.550
your little wife
had in mind?


814
00:34:06.618 --> 00:34:07.880
Don't joke about that

815
00:34:07.953 --> 00:34:09.215
She's still my wife

816
00:34:09.288 --> 00:34:11.415
All of a sudden,
he's got a conscience


817
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:14.425
Listen, I think it's time
we started discussing our future


818
00:34:14.493 --> 00:34:17.087
What about this?
Do you think she'd like this?


819
00:34:17.162 --> 00:34:19.027
Listen,
I'm serious about this


820
00:34:19.098 --> 00:34:22.033
We have to decide where
this relationship is going


821
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:25.036
Obviously, It's not going anywhere,
now, is it, Francis?


822
00:34:25.104 --> 00:34:26.696
No Obviously,
you don't understand


823
00:34:26.772 --> 00:34:29.036
This relationship has
to reach the next level,


824
00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:30.700
and we, as a couple,

825
00:34:30.776 --> 00:34:33.210
have to decide what
that next level is


826
00:34:33.278 --> 00:34:34.711
Why the sudden urgency?

827
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.213
Well, for one thing

828
00:34:36.281 --> 00:34:38.044
I don't like
the fact that


829
00:34:38.117 --> 00:34:39.812
you have sex
with a geriatric


830
00:34:39.885 --> 00:34:41.477
Well, how
do you think I feel


831
00:34:41.553 --> 00:34:44.147
about you going home and seeing
your wife every night?


832
00:34:44.223 --> 00:34:47.192
I haven't had sex
with my wife in months


833
00:34:47.259 --> 00:34:50.524
Well, I don't know if that's
such a good idea, Francis


834
00:34:50.596 --> 00:34:52.198
Clearly, you
need the practice


835
00:34:52.331 --> 00:34:53.855
You know, Francis

836
00:34:53.933 --> 00:34:56.527
you're afraid to ask her
for a divorce


837
00:34:56.602 --> 00:34:59.662
Why don't you just have sex
with her in the meantime?


838
00:34:59.738 --> 00:35:02.104
Dad, I'm in love
with another woman


839
00:35:02.174 --> 00:35:03.937
I don't think
it would be fair


840
00:35:04.009 --> 00:35:05.601
to have sex with Renee

841
00:35:05.678 --> 00:35:07.305
Let me get this straight

842
00:35:07.379 --> 00:35:11.315
You don't want to cheat
on your girlfriend with your wife?


843
00:35:11.383 --> 00:35:12.975
Yeah I guess so

844
00:35:13.052 --> 00:35:14.542
Jesus Christ, Francis

845
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.212
You sure
I'm your father?


846
00:35:16.288 --> 00:35:19.849
You know, I'm gonna have to double-check
with your mother on this


847
00:35:19.925 --> 00:35:21.790
Come on, Dad

848
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.589
I'm serious

849
00:35:23.662 --> 00:35:26.222
How do you think
Mom will take it?


850
00:35:26.298 --> 00:35:27.560
She's gonna be
devastated


851
00:35:27.633 --> 00:35:30.067
She's been up at that goddamn church
every morning


852
00:35:30.135 --> 00:35:31.397
praying for your brother

853
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.596
Then she tells me yesterday

854
00:35:32.671 --> 00:35:34.605
I spend too much
time on the boat


855
00:35:34.673 --> 00:35:36.937
Well, I don't even want to get
into that discussion


856
00:35:37.009 --> 00:35:38.601
Now you're gonna
get divorced


857
00:35:38.677 --> 00:35:39.905
Christ

858
00:35:39.979 --> 00:35:42.846
She'll be up there with Father John

859
00:35:42.915 --> 00:35:44.177
Thanks a lot, buddy

860
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.842
I'm probably going
to have to start


861
00:35:45.918 --> 00:35:47.351
making my own
breakfast again


862
00:35:48.487 --> 00:35:51.285
I'm sorry if my
divorce interferes


863
00:35:51.357 --> 00:35:53.552
with your
breakfast plans, Dad


864
00:35:53.626 --> 00:35:56.857
Hey, don't get all sensitive
on me now, Barbara


865
00:35:56.929 --> 00:35:58.362
You know,
all your life


866
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:59.897
you've always
wanted to screw


867
00:35:59.965 --> 00:36:01.557
every good-looking
skirt who walked by


868
00:36:01.634 --> 00:36:03.158
Now you're making
all this money,


869
00:36:03.235 --> 00:36:05.135
you're probably
finding you can have


870
00:36:05.204 --> 00:36:06.796
at least half of them

871
00:36:06.872 --> 00:36:08.134
Come on, Dad

872
00:36:08.207 --> 00:36:11.142
What have you been
telling me my whole life?


873
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:14.145
I gotta do what makes
me happy first, right?


874
00:36:19.485 --> 00:36:22.784
Besides, it's normal
male behavior, right?


875
00:36:22.855 --> 00:36:24.254
We can't control

876
00:36:24.323 --> 00:36:26.188
millions of years
of evolution


877
00:36:29.428 --> 00:36:31.794
You know... You know
what it's like, really?


878
00:36:33.299 --> 00:36:35.563
It's just like you...
you've been driving


879
00:36:35.634 --> 00:36:38.398
a '74 Buick
your whole life


880
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:39.801
Then suddenly,

881
00:36:39.872 --> 00:36:43.433
you find yourself behind
the wheel of a brand-new Porsche


882
00:36:44.643 --> 00:36:47.612
How do you go back
to the Buick?


883
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.612
Yeah

884
00:36:50.382 --> 00:36:51.872
I guess you can't

885
00:36:56.689 --> 00:36:57.951
You know what, Dad?

886
00:37:00.492 --> 00:37:02.357
I'm really
doing this for Renee


887
00:37:04.496 --> 00:37:06.828
I'm sure she's gonna
be really thrilled


888
00:37:12.204 --> 00:37:13.136
Thank you

889
00:37:14.973 --> 00:37:15.905
Thanks

890
00:37:15.974 --> 00:37:17.373
Hope: Happy anniversary

891
00:37:19.445 --> 00:37:21.379
You really enjoyed that,
didn't you?


892
00:37:21.447 --> 00:37:22.880
They were fun,
weren't they?


893
00:37:22.948 --> 00:37:24.882
Yeah No, they were
They were a lot of fun,


894
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.884
but they were also
a $12 fare, you know?


895
00:37:26.952 --> 00:37:29.011
Oh, they were sweet
It was their anniversary


896
00:37:29.088 --> 00:37:31.249
Well, I'm very happy for them,
but you know what?


897
00:37:31.323 --> 00:37:33.257
They looked like they could afford
to pay 12 bucks,


898
00:37:33.325 --> 00:37:34.917
whereas we,
on the other hand, cannot


899
00:37:34.993 --> 00:37:36.585
I'll pay the $12,
Mr. Cheapo


900
00:37:36.662 --> 00:37:37.594
Oh, really Oh

901
00:37:37.663 --> 00:37:39.597
And do you happen
to have this $12


902
00:37:39.665 --> 00:37:41.064
on you by any chance?

903
00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:42.395
No Not right now

904
00:37:42.468 --> 00:37:43.901
I'll give it to you later

905
00:37:43.969 --> 00:37:46.369
Great Great Listen,
you gotta do me a favor


906
00:37:46.438 --> 00:37:48.372
You know, I don't
mean to sound like a jerk,


907
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.374
but next time you ask to come
to work with me,


908
00:37:50.442 --> 00:37:51.875
remind me to say no

909
00:37:51.944 --> 00:37:53.878
And all this time
I thought you were romantic


910
00:37:53.946 --> 00:37:55.573
I am
I am a romantic


911
00:37:55.647 --> 00:37:57.080
But you know what it is?

912
00:37:57.149 --> 00:37:58.582
As long as it
doesn't interfere


913
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.083
with paying
the rent on time


914
00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:02.279
Mick, I would rather live
in the back of this cab


915
00:38:02.354 --> 00:38:03.787
than let something like rent

916
00:38:03.856 --> 00:38:05.448
get in the way
of our romance


917
00:38:05.524 --> 00:38:07.822
what do you have
to say to that?


918
00:38:09.762 --> 00:38:10.820
OK OK

919
00:38:10.896 --> 00:38:12.488
When you're right,
you're right


920
00:38:12.564 --> 00:38:13.496
Sure

921
00:38:13.565 --> 00:38:15.157
But you know,
speaking of backseats,


922
00:38:15.234 --> 00:38:16.826
I do know
a little place


923
00:38:16.902 --> 00:38:19.200
where we could park
and maybe, you know,


924
00:38:19.271 --> 00:38:21.865
put this backseat theory
of yours to the test


925
00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.872
Yeah?

926
00:38:22.941 --> 00:38:23.873
Yeah

927
00:38:23.942 --> 00:38:24.874
Let's go

928
00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:27.403
Oh, my God

929
00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:31.815
Yeah

930
00:38:31.884 --> 00:38:34.148
She's been
with her sister all day


931
00:38:36.054 --> 00:38:38.318
Hold on I think
this is her


932
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:39.357
Shit

933
00:38:39.425 --> 00:38:41.620
Listen, I'll, uh,
I'll call you later


934
00:38:44.363 --> 00:38:46.797
Hi, honey
Who was that?


935
00:38:46.865 --> 00:38:47.832
You know, uh,

936
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.492
what's-his-face
from work


937
00:38:49.568 --> 00:38:52.162
Oh You've talked
to him a lot lately


938
00:38:52.237 --> 00:38:53.829
Anyhow, your old
Scott from college


939
00:38:53.906 --> 00:38:55.498
was talking
to my friend Nicole


940
00:38:55.574 --> 00:38:57.974
You know her I went to camp
with her sister Patty


941
00:38:58.043 --> 00:38:59.135
Right
I know Nicole


942
00:38:59.211 --> 00:39:01.406
She went to BU
with Scott's brother David


943
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.345
Well, anyhow,
he was telling her


944
00:39:03.415 --> 00:39:05.246
that his divorce
was just finalized


945
00:39:05.317 --> 00:39:06.249
Ohh

946
00:39:07.653 --> 00:39:09.143
W
-Who got divorced?

947
00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:10.518
You know,
Scott Sherman


948
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:12.523
Yeah
He caught his wife


949
00:39:12.591 --> 00:39:14.582
boning her dentist
in the shower


950
00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.821
"Boning"?
That's charming


951
00:39:16.895 --> 00:39:18.328
Oh Oh
This is fatso


952
00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:21.389
Four-eyed,
greasy-haired Scott?


953
00:39:21.467 --> 00:39:24.061
The computer geek tapping
on the keyboard there


954
00:39:24.136 --> 00:39:25.933
He was not that fat

955
00:39:26.004 --> 00:39:29.599
He was a 300-pound
sack of shit, hon


956
00:39:29.675 --> 00:39:31.609
Maybe to you
that's not fat,


957
00:39:31.677 --> 00:39:33.269
but, uh, what the hell?

958
00:39:33.345 --> 00:39:34.607
You loved the animal

959
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.307
Oh, that's
really nice


960
00:39:36.381 --> 00:39:38.315
And he was
not 300 pounds


961
00:39:38.383 --> 00:39:39.645
He was slightly
overweight,


962
00:39:39.718 --> 00:39:40.685
that's all, right?

963
00:39:40.752 --> 00:39:43.619
Renee, his tits
were bigger than mine


964
00:39:43.689 --> 00:39:44.951
All right,
all right,


965
00:39:45.023 --> 00:39:46.615
so he wasn't
so skinny,


966
00:39:46.692 --> 00:39:49.126
but he was a very smart,
really sweet guy,


967
00:39:49.194 --> 00:39:51.355
which is a hell
of a lot more


968
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.694
than I can say
for the two of you


969
00:39:53.765 --> 00:39:56.791
You better be sweet,
you weigh 500, huh?


970
00:39:56.869 --> 00:39:59.201
What is your problem
with Scott?


971
00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:01.205
He's just a shy,
harmless guy


972
00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:03.935
Do you have to be
in competition with everybody?


973
00:40:04.009 --> 00:40:05.601
Well, you know what, hon?

974
00:40:05.677 --> 00:40:07.304
If he's such a fucking sweetheart

975
00:40:07.379 --> 00:40:08.641
and I'm such a creep,

976
00:40:08.714 --> 00:40:10.648
why didn't you
marry the fat pig?


977
00:40:10.716 --> 00:40:12.149
I don't know
If I'd known


978
00:40:12.217 --> 00:40:13.878
you were going to turn
into such an asshole,


979
00:40:13.952 --> 00:40:14.884
maybe I would have

980
00:40:14.953 --> 00:40:15.885
Well, fat or not,

981
00:40:15.954 --> 00:40:17.478
guess who's got
his phone number?


982
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.854
You? You have
Scott's phone number?


983
00:40:20.926 --> 00:40:22.860
Well, you're not
going to call him


984
00:40:22.928 --> 00:40:24.259
Of course I am

985
00:40:24.329 --> 00:40:26.854
What, you think you're
the only one who's gonna marry rich?


986
00:40:26.932 --> 00:40:28.365
I need somebody to pick up

987
00:40:28.433 --> 00:40:29.832
My Bergdorf bills,
too, sweetheart


988
00:40:29.902 --> 00:40:32.166
Wh-Where are you from?
What do you know?


989
00:40:32.237 --> 00:40:33.704
You're my sister

990
00:40:33.772 --> 00:40:36.240
There's supposed to be an honor code
between siblings


991
00:40:36.308 --> 00:40:38.071
I mean,
you do not date


992
00:40:38.143 --> 00:40:39.405
your sister's
ex-boyfriend


993
00:40:39.478 --> 00:40:42.447
Honey, let her
go out with him


994
00:40:42.514 --> 00:40:45.210
What the fuck
is the big deal, anyway?


995
00:40:45.284 --> 00:40:46.410
Unless you, uh,

996
00:40:46.485 --> 00:40:48.510
still have feelings
for the yard ape


997
00:40:48.587 --> 00:40:51.317
No It has nothing
to do with that, OK?


998
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.881
This is... This has to do
with respect


999
00:40:53.959 --> 00:40:54.891
That's all: Respect

1000
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.224
A word that the two of you

1001
00:40:57.296 --> 00:40:59.230
obviously are not
very familiar with


1002
00:41:03.635 --> 00:41:05.830
My friend Connie doesn't think
we'll last another month


1003
00:41:05.904 --> 00:41:07.667
Why would she say
something like that?


1004
00:41:07.739 --> 00:41:08.933
She thinks
you're a jerk


1005
00:41:09.007 --> 00:41:10.440
Why does she
think I'm a jerk?


1006
00:41:10.509 --> 00:41:11.942
I don't even
know this person


1007
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.602
'Cause you haven't said yes
to Paris yet


1008
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:16.409
Yeah Well, you haven't been
accepted yet either, have you?


1009
00:41:16.481 --> 00:41:18.642
Well, I also told her
about your brother and father


1010
00:41:18.717 --> 00:41:20.912
and those weird fishing trips
you guys take


1011
00:41:20.986 --> 00:41:23.386
Hey, don't go bashing
the fishing trips, all right?


1012
00:41:23.455 --> 00:41:25.047
I mean, that's
a family tradition


1013
00:41:25.123 --> 00:41:26.385
Those trips are sacred

1014
00:41:26.458 --> 00:41:27.550
You don't think
it's weird


1015
00:41:27.626 --> 00:41:29.059
that your mom never
goes on the boat?


1016
00:41:29.127 --> 00:41:30.719
Listen, my dad
has a rule


1017
00:41:30.796 --> 00:41:32.388
No women on the boat

1018
00:41:32.464 --> 00:41:34.728
You don't think that's
a little strange, Mick?


1019
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.062
I mean, yeah,
it's strange,


1020
00:41:36.134 --> 00:41:38.534
but that's the way
my dad thinks, you know?


1021
00:41:38.604 --> 00:41:40.196
He's from the old school

1022
00:41:40.272 --> 00:41:42.331
OK So what's
Fran's excuse?


1023
00:41:42.407 --> 00:41:44.841
Franny, you know, Franny...
Franny's got some issues


1024
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.775
Yeah I'd say so

1025
00:41:48.847 --> 00:41:50.815
What are you doing
getting me gifts?


1026
00:41:50.882 --> 00:41:52.509
You don't have
to give me anything


1027
00:41:52.584 --> 00:41:53.516
It was nothing

1028
00:41:53.585 --> 00:41:55.177
Do you like it?

1029
00:41:55.253 --> 00:41:56.311
Yeah, of course

1030
00:41:56.388 --> 00:41:57.821
l... I love it

1031
00:41:57.889 --> 00:42:00.790
Hey, what happened
to, uh, the TV?


1032
00:42:01.994 --> 00:42:03.985
What, your brother
didn't tell you?


1033
00:42:04.062 --> 00:42:06.087
My brother?

1034
00:42:06.164 --> 00:42:07.461
Tell me what?

1035
00:42:07.532 --> 00:42:08.999
It was his TV

1036
00:42:09.067 --> 00:42:11.535
He came up here
and got it


1037
00:42:11.603 --> 00:42:13.434
My brother?

1038
00:42:13.505 --> 00:42:16.406
Your ex-fiancé was up
in this apartment?


1039
00:42:16.475 --> 00:42:17.499
When was this?

1040
00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:19.840
I don't know
A few weeks ago


1041
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:21.845
Picked me up
in his cab


1042
00:42:21.913 --> 00:42:24.746
You didn't want
to share this with me?


1043
00:42:24.816 --> 00:42:26.750
Jesus, Franny,
since when do I


1044
00:42:26.818 --> 00:42:28.683
have to tell you
anything?


1045
00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:29.948
Wait, wait, wait

1046
00:42:30.022 --> 00:42:31.751
So my brother came into

1047
00:42:31.823 --> 00:42:33.950
your bedroom and

1048
00:42:34.026 --> 00:42:35.994
took a TV?

1049
00:42:36.061 --> 00:42:37.085
That's it?

1050
00:42:37.162 --> 00:42:39.289
No actually, I tried
to get him in bed,


1051
00:42:39.364 --> 00:42:40.626
but he wasn't
interested


1052
00:42:40.699 --> 00:42:41.631
That's very funny

1053
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.634
You know,
he's married now


1054
00:42:43.702 --> 00:42:44.691
Picked up some

1055
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.704
psycho waitress,
and, like,


1056
00:42:46.772 --> 00:42:48.364
married her in his cab

1057
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.032
or some shit like that

1058
00:42:50.108 --> 00:42:52.042
I know, you told me

1059
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.375
Sort of surprising move coming
from Mickey, don't you think?


1060
00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:58.507
It would have been nice to see
some of that impulsiveness


1061
00:42:58.583 --> 00:42:59.845
when we were together

1062
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.520
What the fuck
does that mean?


1063
00:43:03.588 --> 00:43:05.613
Nothing

1064
00:43:07.926 --> 00:43:09.917
[Knock On Door]

1065
00:43:09.995 --> 00:43:12.429
Hey, Fran What
are you doing here?


1066
00:43:12.497 --> 00:43:15.432
What, can't come by
and see my big bro?


1067
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.432
Yeah, sure

1068
00:43:17.669 --> 00:43:19.603
Jesus Christ

1069
00:43:19.671 --> 00:43:22.003
What a fucking dump

1070
00:43:22.074 --> 00:43:25.373
Hey, uh, like
the pink walls, though


1071
00:43:25.444 --> 00:43:28.436
Finally, uh, comfortable
with that part of yourself, huh?


1072
00:43:28.513 --> 00:43:30.378
You can't just
come in, sit down,


1073
00:43:30.449 --> 00:43:32.110
and keep your mouth shut,
right, moneybags?


1074
00:43:32.184 --> 00:43:34.175
That would just be
too difficult for you, huh?


1075
00:43:34.252 --> 00:43:35.310
I'm sorry

1076
00:43:35.387 --> 00:43:39.824
Forgot Mr. Summer Breeze
is so "sensitivo"


1077
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:41.620
Hey, I like the, uh,

1078
00:43:41.693 --> 00:43:42.717
like the TV

1079
00:43:42.794 --> 00:43:45.388
How'd you... How'd you
swing that one, man?


1080
00:43:45.464 --> 00:43:47.489
I thought that you two
were broke, or


1081
00:43:47.566 --> 00:43:50.433
Yeah Yeah,
we still are, but, um


1082
00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:52.094
you actually
won't believe this


1083
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:54.195
I picked up,
uh, Heather


1084
00:43:54.272 --> 00:43:56.763
in my cab, and, you know,
we got to talking,


1085
00:43:56.842 --> 00:43:58.776
and she said she
still had my old TV


1086
00:43:58.844 --> 00:44:00.778
So I, you know,
I went up to her place


1087
00:44:00.846 --> 00:44:02.211
and, uh,
you know, took it


1088
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.374
It's kind of strange
seeing her again, you know?


1089
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:08.476
So you went back
and took your TV?


1090
00:44:08.553 --> 00:44:11.317
Well, you see it
sitting there, don't you?


1091
00:44:11.389 --> 00:44:13.721
You didn't feel
like a loser?


1092
00:44:13.792 --> 00:44:16.420
Wh-Why would I
feel like a loser?


1093
00:44:17.596 --> 00:44:20.258
Oh, I don't know,
uh, three years go by,


1094
00:44:20.332 --> 00:44:22.266
and you scurry back
for a TV?


1095
00:44:22.334 --> 00:44:23.596
I mean, it's like,

1096
00:44:23.668 --> 00:44:24.930
admitting
you're a failure


1097
00:44:25.003 --> 00:44:27.267
and you can't
afford a new TV


1098
00:44:27.339 --> 00:44:29.739
How the hell do we
have the same blood


1099
00:44:29.808 --> 00:44:30.740
pumping through
our veins?


1100
00:44:30.809 --> 00:44:32.743
You really think
I give a shit


1101
00:44:32.811 --> 00:44:34.403
what Heather thinks
about me?


1102
00:44:34.479 --> 00:44:36.071
I mean, come on, Franny

1103
00:44:38.717 --> 00:44:40.708
So'd you
you fuck her?


1104
00:44:42.687 --> 00:44:44.279
Did l... Did I what?

1105
00:44:44.356 --> 00:44:47.416
Well, you're up in the apartment
Did you


1106
00:44:47.492 --> 00:44:48.925
did you put it to her?
You bang her?


1107
00:44:48.994 --> 00:44:50.723
What...
Wh-Wh-What do you think?


1108
00:44:50.796 --> 00:44:52.388
I'm some sort
of degenerate?


1109
00:44:52.464 --> 00:44:54.762
You think I'm some
sort of immoral skell


1110
00:44:54.833 --> 00:44:56.425
who cheats on his wife?

1111
00:44:56.501 --> 00:44:59.095
Listen, I don't
cheat on my wife, OK?


1112
00:44:59.171 --> 00:45:00.433
Oh, so

1113
00:45:00.505 --> 00:45:02.097
so you didn't
fuck her?


1114
00:45:02.174 --> 00:45:03.869
L-l-It just dawned
on me, Franny


1115
00:45:03.942 --> 00:45:05.637
You haven't fully
evolved yet, have you?


1116
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:06.677
Mick, come on,

1117
00:45:06.745 --> 00:45:08.975
I mean, you almost
married this woman


1118
00:45:09.047 --> 00:45:12.642
Then you're going up to be alone
in her apartment to


1119
00:45:12.717 --> 00:45:14.446
get a TV

1120
00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:16.453
I don't buy it

1121
00:45:16.521 --> 00:45:18.614
What do you want
to hear, all right?


1122
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.056
I mean, do you want to hear
that I had sex with her?


1123
00:45:21.126 --> 00:45:22.559
I mean, would that
make you happy?


1124
00:45:22.627 --> 00:45:24.060
All right, yeah
No, I did her


1125
00:45:24.129 --> 00:45:25.528
I did her
on the kitchen table


1126
00:45:25.597 --> 00:45:26.825
We did it on the couch

1127
00:45:26.898 --> 00:45:28.798
We even did it on the frigging TV
It was beautiful


1128
00:45:28.867 --> 00:45:31.028
I mean, I think you
would have been proud of me


1129
00:45:31.102 --> 00:45:33.536
Hey, play all the games
you want to play, Mick,


1130
00:45:33.605 --> 00:45:34.867
but I'm a man

1131
00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.373
I know what I know

1132
00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:38.739
Oh, you know what you know

1133
00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:42.405
Listen, you know, Franny,
l... I don't need this shit from you, OK?


1134
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.846
I don't need you to come over
to my apartment


1135
00:45:44.916 --> 00:45:46.178
and bust my hump

1136
00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:48.776
Why don't you just
do me a favor


1137
00:45:48.854 --> 00:45:51.448
and get the hell
out of here, OK?


1138
00:45:51.523 --> 00:45:53.457
Sure, I'll

1139
00:45:53.525 --> 00:45:55.220
I'll do you that favor

1140
00:45:55.293 --> 00:45:57.227
Don't hurry back,
all right?


1141
00:46:00.232 --> 00:46:01.164
Fuck

1142
00:46:02.834 --> 00:46:04.665
I'm sorry, Mick

1143
00:46:04.736 --> 00:46:08.433
See, I get so guilty
about this fucking divorce


1144
00:46:08.506 --> 00:46:11.031
I shouldn't feel
guilty about that, right?


1145
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:13.509
No No You shouldn't

1146
00:46:13.578 --> 00:46:15.842
What you should feel
guilty about, though,


1147
00:46:15.914 --> 00:46:19.475
is fucking that other woman
for the last six months


1148
00:46:19.551 --> 00:46:22.315
That's what you should feel
guilty about


1149
00:46:25.824 --> 00:46:26.756
Tom

1150
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:28.554
if you were single,

1151
00:46:28.627 --> 00:46:30.891
would you date
your brother's ex-girlfriend?


1152
00:46:30.962 --> 00:46:33.760
I don't have a brother,
Mr. Fitzpatrick


1153
00:46:33.832 --> 00:46:35.561
But if you did,

1154
00:46:35.634 --> 00:46:36.896
is that off-limits?

1155
00:46:36.968 --> 00:46:40.961
I'd have to say that only
the lowest of the low,


1156
00:46:41.039 --> 00:46:42.404
a real scumbag,

1157
00:46:42.474 --> 00:46:44.704
would date
his brother's ex


1158
00:46:44.776 --> 00:46:47.176
There's a code
between siblings


1159
00:46:49.447 --> 00:46:50.379
Thanks, Tom

1160
00:46:57.555 --> 00:46:58.487
Thanks

1161
00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:02.684
She's beautiful,
isn't she?


1162
00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:05.594
Yeah
Yeah, she really is


1163
00:47:05.664 --> 00:47:08.258
You know she got
her acceptance letter today?


1164
00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:10.893
Yeah, I know
She showed it to me


1165
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.470
You better go with her
to Paris, all right?


1166
00:47:14.539 --> 00:47:16.973
Because it's bad enough
that you broke my heart


1167
00:47:17.042 --> 00:47:18.600
when you swept her
off her feet,


1168
00:47:18.677 --> 00:47:19.701
and I am absolutely not

1169
00:47:19.778 --> 00:47:22.178
going to let any man
hurt her again, OK?


1170
00:47:22.247 --> 00:47:23.179
Broke your heart?

1171
00:47:23.248 --> 00:47:24.681
How did I manage
to break your heart?


1172
00:47:24.749 --> 00:47:27.809
I mean, I just what, when did
I meet you, five minutes ago?


1173
00:47:27.886 --> 00:47:29.581
My heart belongs to Hope

1174
00:47:29.654 --> 00:47:30.814
I love her

1175
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.322
You love her?

1176
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.618
Yeah

1177
00:47:33.692 --> 00:47:36.627
Do you guys have some sort
of special relationship


1178
00:47:36.695 --> 00:47:37.627
that maybe, you know,

1179
00:47:37.696 --> 00:47:39.288
I should be aware of,

1180
00:47:39.364 --> 00:47:41.161
seeing as, like,
I'm married to her?


1181
00:47:41.232 --> 00:47:42.164
Maybe, you know

1182
00:47:42.233 --> 00:47:44.292
She didn't tell you
about that?


1183
00:47:44.369 --> 00:47:45.893
No No, she seems to, uh,

1184
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:47.529
have forgotten
to mention it, actually


1185
00:47:47.605 --> 00:47:50.233
Oh, oh, no,
No, no, nothing... nothing like that


1186
00:47:50.308 --> 00:47:51.275
Nothing

1187
00:47:51.343 --> 00:47:53.277
sexual or anything

1188
00:47:53.345 --> 00:47:55.313
Good That's a...
That's a good thing


1189
00:47:56.781 --> 00:47:58.214
Um, but, who knows?

1190
00:47:58.283 --> 00:48:01.081
I mean, maybe one day
if I'm lucky,


1191
00:48:01.152 --> 00:48:03.347
you'll let me
share her with you


1192
00:48:04.422 --> 00:48:05.354
Hmm

1193
00:48:14.499 --> 00:48:15.625
Hey

1194
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.930
Yeah Your friend
Connie here,


1195
00:48:18.003 --> 00:48:19.300
she, um

1196
00:48:19.371 --> 00:48:21.305
she claims
you guys have a


1197
00:48:21.373 --> 00:48:22.635
like a... some sort

1198
00:48:22.707 --> 00:48:24.334
of special relationship
or something


1199
00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:26.309
Did she ask
if you would share me?


1200
00:48:26.378 --> 00:48:27.572
Yeah Yeah, she

1201
00:48:27.645 --> 00:48:28.976
she asked about that

1202
00:48:29.047 --> 00:48:31.174
Well, what do you
think of that?


1203
00:48:31.249 --> 00:48:33.513
Well, you know, I mean,
to be perfectly honest,


1204
00:48:33.585 --> 00:48:35.849
the idea of, you know, two women

1205
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.353
at once seems like, you know,

1206
00:48:37.422 --> 00:48:39.185
like a pleasant way
to spend an evening


1207
00:48:39.257 --> 00:48:40.849
But you know, of course

1208
00:48:40.925 --> 00:48:43.189
not if one of the,
you know, girls were my wife


1209
00:48:43.261 --> 00:48:46.355
You know, I don't want to do it
with anyone else,


1210
00:48:46.431 --> 00:48:47.363
So, you know,

1211
00:48:47.432 --> 00:48:48.364
so, yeah No

1212
00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.866
You better believe
you don't want


1213
00:48:49.934 --> 00:48:51.265
to do it
with anyone else


1214
00:48:51.336 --> 00:48:54.669
But you and her...
I mean, you guys actually never


1215
00:48:54.739 --> 00:48:56.866
consummated,
you know, this love


1216
00:48:56.941 --> 00:48:58.670
that she speaks of?

1217
00:48:58.743 --> 00:48:59.675
No

1218
00:48:59.744 --> 00:49:01.075
Well, it does...

1219
00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:03.307
It does paint a pretty mental picture,
doesn't it, right?


1220
00:49:03.381 --> 00:49:06.077
I mean, I hear
it's very popular in... in Paris


1221
00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:09.086
You know, the whole ménage a trois
thing is French, right?


1222
00:49:09.154 --> 00:49:11.748
Yeah Don't get
too smart there, funny man


1223
00:49:11.823 --> 00:49:13.848
So, are you gonna come?

1224
00:49:13.925 --> 00:49:15.859
To... To Paris?

1225
00:49:15.927 --> 00:49:17.622
I don't know you...
you're definitely,


1226
00:49:17.695 --> 00:49:19.629
I mean, you're serious
about, you know,


1227
00:49:19.697 --> 00:49:20.959
going through with this?

1228
00:49:21.032 --> 00:49:22.465
Yeah

1229
00:49:22.534 --> 00:49:26.265
Yeah, well, then, I
guess I gotta go, right?


1230
00:49:26.337 --> 00:49:28.168
I guess so

1231
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.544
So you're really
gonna move to Paris?


1232
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.584
Yeah I guess
it looks that way


1233
00:49:40.652 --> 00:49:43.177
Wow Well, I bet
you didn't count on that


1234
00:49:43.254 --> 00:49:44.846
when you met her, huh?

1235
00:49:44.923 --> 00:49:46.686
I don't know,
Fran, you know?


1236
00:49:46.758 --> 00:49:48.055
I mean, I'm

1237
00:49:48.126 --> 00:49:51.357
I'm starting to feel confused
about this thing, you know?


1238
00:49:51.429 --> 00:49:52.726
What, are you kidding me?

1239
00:49:52.797 --> 00:49:54.230
I don't know
You know what?


1240
00:49:54.299 --> 00:49:56.290
You know, it's like
I don't even know this girl


1241
00:49:56.367 --> 00:49:58.301
I mean, she's got
these weird friends,


1242
00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:00.064
she loves this dump
we live in,


1243
00:50:00.138 --> 00:50:01.571
and now, all of a sudden,

1244
00:50:01.639 --> 00:50:03.903
she brings up this
moving to Paris thing


1245
00:50:03.975 --> 00:50:05.943
I don't know, you remember
our little discussion


1246
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.444
about when I went over
to Heather's that day?


1247
00:50:08.513 --> 00:50:09.445
Yeah

1248
00:50:09.514 --> 00:50:11.106
I mean, I don't know,

1249
00:50:11.182 --> 00:50:12.774
that's got me
freaked out, too


1250
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:15.581
You know, I mean, part
of me wanted to hate her,


1251
00:50:15.653 --> 00:50:17.245
and part of me wanted to

1252
00:50:17.322 --> 00:50:19.688
I don't know, there was
a weird connection, you know?


1253
00:50:19.757 --> 00:50:22.089
I mean, we almost got married
a few years ago


1254
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.991
Mick, come clean

1255
00:50:24.062 --> 00:50:25.290
You fucked her

1256
00:50:25.363 --> 00:50:26.955
Franny, don't start,
all right?


1257
00:50:27.031 --> 00:50:28.328
Hey, Mick, come on

1258
00:50:28.399 --> 00:50:30.458
You're talking about a weird
connection here, I mean


1259
00:50:30.535 --> 00:50:32.469
Wh-What, are you still
in love with her?


1260
00:50:32.537 --> 00:50:36.132
No No, it's nothing like that

1261
00:50:36.207 --> 00:50:37.435
But what? I mean,

1262
00:50:37.509 --> 00:50:39.807
did she say that she's
in love with you, or


1263
00:50:39.878 --> 00:50:42.642
No I'm just saying
it was weird, you know?


1264
00:50:42.714 --> 00:50:44.306
Seeing her again
That's all


1265
00:50:44.382 --> 00:50:46.077
I mean,
it was nothing


1266
00:50:46.151 --> 00:50:47.482
Forget I said it

1267
00:50:49.954 --> 00:50:52.013
Yeah, I can
meet you there


1268
00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.490
46th and 8th
All right


1269
00:51:00.431 --> 00:51:02.592
Nice spot
you picked here


1270
00:51:02.667 --> 00:51:04.362
Yeah, well,
you know, I, uh,


1271
00:51:04.435 --> 00:51:05.697
figured it was safe

1272
00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.032
Don't flatter
yourself, Mickey


1273
00:51:07.105 --> 00:51:09.096
I'm just here to talk

1274
00:51:09.174 --> 00:51:10.106
OK

1275
00:51:10.175 --> 00:51:11.437
Why don't we talk?

1276
00:51:13.278 --> 00:51:15.872
Well, I was thinking
about how I, um,


1277
00:51:15.947 --> 00:51:18.211
treated you
a few weeks ago, and


1278
00:51:18.283 --> 00:51:20.547
I just wanted
to apologize for that


1279
00:51:21.853 --> 00:51:23.411
And for that night

1280
00:51:24.722 --> 00:51:25.950
Yeah, well

1281
00:51:26.024 --> 00:51:27.958
It's a long
time ago, right?


1282
00:51:28.026 --> 00:51:29.618
I mean, it happens

1283
00:51:30.728 --> 00:51:33.219
So, do you... you think
we can be friends?


1284
00:51:35.099 --> 00:51:36.259
Yeah Yeah, sure

1285
00:51:36.334 --> 00:51:37.596
We can be friends

1286
00:51:37.669 --> 00:51:39.603
And you know,
I'm sorry, too,


1287
00:51:39.671 --> 00:51:42.265
about bringing up,
you know, the whole, uh,


1288
00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.366
college tuition
payment plan thing, you know?


1289
00:51:45.443 --> 00:51:49.004
Sort of fun seeing
one another again, huh?


1290
00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.342
Don't you think?

1291
00:51:50.415 --> 00:51:53.680
I mean, I don't know
if I'd call it fun,


1292
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:56.015
but, uh, you know,
certainly interesting


1293
00:51:59.591 --> 00:52:02.458
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about you


1294
00:52:02.527 --> 00:52:04.791
since you came up
that day, and


1295
00:52:04.862 --> 00:52:06.386
I don't know,

1296
00:52:06.464 --> 00:52:10.423
sort of thinking, uh,
maybe things could have been different


1297
00:52:10.501 --> 00:52:12.093
Maybe we made a mistake

1298
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.364
We?

1299
00:52:13.438 --> 00:52:16.430
Hey, all I did was come home
in the middle of night


1300
00:52:16.507 --> 00:52:19.567
to find you and, you know,
gorilla boy, in your birthday suits


1301
00:52:19.644 --> 00:52:21.578
OK So I made the mistake,

1302
00:52:21.646 --> 00:52:24.080
But, I mean, did you have
to run off like that,


1303
00:52:24.148 --> 00:52:25.740
never to be heard from again?

1304
00:52:25.817 --> 00:52:27.876
Yeah I mean, what
did you expect me to do?


1305
00:52:27.952 --> 00:52:29.385
Jump in and join the party?

1306
00:52:29.454 --> 00:52:30.386
No

1307
00:52:33.358 --> 00:52:34.882
I don't know

1308
00:52:34.959 --> 00:52:36.586
Maybe give it
another chance


1309
00:52:36.661 --> 00:52:38.026
What... and... and

1310
00:52:38.096 --> 00:52:40.326
and break up
this beautiful new friendship?


1311
00:52:41.432 --> 00:52:43.900
I'm not about to do that

1312
00:52:43.968 --> 00:52:45.868
Besides, you know, um

1313
00:52:47.605 --> 00:52:49.436
I'm married now,
you know,


1314
00:52:49.507 --> 00:52:50.439
so

1315
00:52:51.709 --> 00:52:53.939
I'm gonna get
out of here


1316
00:52:55.013 --> 00:53:05.013
Bye

1317
00:53:07.958 --> 00:53:09.050
Your mother told me

1318
00:53:09.125 --> 00:53:11.059
he's still giving you
that down cycle nonsense


1319
00:53:11.127 --> 00:53:13.061
32 years your mother
and I have been married


1320
00:53:13.129 --> 00:53:15.893
I don't think we've hit a down day,
let alone a down cycle


1321
00:53:15.966 --> 00:53:17.900
Mom, would you just make him
go away, please?


1322
00:53:17.968 --> 00:53:19.902
Yeah, really, Dad,
that is disgusting


1323
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:21.904
What's disgusting?
That's true love, young lady


1324
00:53:21.972 --> 00:53:22.904
Please

1325
00:53:22.973 --> 00:53:23.905
spare us

1326
00:53:23.974 --> 00:53:25.908
I'm going to spare you
I'm leaving


1327
00:53:25.976 --> 00:53:27.409
I know when I'm not wanted

1328
00:53:27.477 --> 00:53:28.876
Good Thank you

1329
00:53:28.945 --> 00:53:31.413
And, hello, could we please not talk
about my sex life anymore?


1330
00:53:31.481 --> 00:53:32.539
Is that possible, please?

1331
00:53:32.615 --> 00:53:34.480
Oh, excuse me, but playing
with a vibrator


1332
00:53:34.551 --> 00:53:36.917
does not qualify
as having a sex life


1333
00:53:36.987 --> 00:53:38.921
Why does she know
that I have a vibrator?


1334
00:53:38.989 --> 00:53:40.422
She's your sister

1335
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:43.425
Look, honey, maybe you should
take him to see a doctor


1336
00:53:43.493 --> 00:53:44.926
All right, look,
Mom, don't start


1337
00:53:44.995 --> 00:53:46.428
No, it could be physical

1338
00:53:46.496 --> 00:53:48.430
Maybe he's having
a problem with his


1339
00:53:48.498 --> 00:53:49.931
What kind of problem?

1340
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.932
You know

1341
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:52.434
Getting an erection

1342
00:53:52.502 --> 00:53:54.094
Mom, come on
I'm warning you


1343
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:55.262
It's possible

1344
00:53:55.338 --> 00:53:56.930
Maybe he's gay

1345
00:53:57.007 --> 00:53:58.440
All right

1346
00:53:58.508 --> 00:54:00.942
Francis is not gay

1347
00:54:02.012 --> 00:54:02.944
Molly's right

1348
00:54:03.013 --> 00:54:04.844
He could be
You never know


1349
00:54:04.914 --> 00:54:07.382
He's always been
a bit of a dandy


1350
00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:08.542
You... Excuse me

1351
00:54:08.618 --> 00:54:10.882
This is my husband we're
talking about here, OK?


1352
00:54:10.954 --> 00:54:12.888
Listen, honey,
here's what you do


1353
00:54:12.956 --> 00:54:15.356
You go and get yourself some of that
Victoria's Secret stuff


1354
00:54:15.425 --> 00:54:16.483
It worked for us

1355
00:54:16.559 --> 00:54:18.891
If he doesn't want you
then, maybe he is gay


1356
00:54:18.962 --> 00:54:20.395
Dad, look, OK?

1357
00:54:20.463 --> 00:54:22.897
My husband is not
a homosexual, OK?


1358
00:54:22.966 --> 00:54:25.400
Yeah, but he's definitely
under suspicion


1359
00:54:25.468 --> 00:54:27.902
What are you talk...
What is that supposed to mean?


1360
00:54:27.971 --> 00:54:29.404
"He's under suspicion"?

1361
00:54:29.472 --> 00:54:30.404
Well

1362
00:54:30.473 --> 00:54:33.033
No! This is just a stage

1363
00:55:48.485 --> 00:55:50.419
[Vibrator Humming]

1364
00:55:53.423 --> 00:55:54.390
I'm sorry

1365
00:55:54.457 --> 00:55:56.425
I looked pretty damn good
in that thing,


1366
00:55:56.493 --> 00:55:58.427
and he barely even
looked at me


1367
00:55:58.495 --> 00:55:59.928
What did I tell you?

1368
00:55:59.996 --> 00:56:01.429
He's definitely queer

1369
00:56:01.498 --> 00:56:02.430
I know

1370
00:56:02.499 --> 00:56:04.433
I think you might be right

1371
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:06.435
Call his father
and tell him about it


1372
00:56:06.503 --> 00:56:08.334
He'll get it out of him

1373
00:56:08.404 --> 00:56:09.837
So, are you?

1374
00:56:09.906 --> 00:56:11.339
Dad, I told you

1375
00:56:11.407 --> 00:56:13.375
I'm in love
with another woman


1376
00:56:13.443 --> 00:56:14.375
You're my father

1377
00:56:14.444 --> 00:56:16.378
How could you
say that to me?


1378
00:56:16.446 --> 00:56:18.880
Franny, I just want
to let you know I'm OK with it


1379
00:56:18.948 --> 00:56:21.382
If you are or you aren't,
it's all right with me


1380
00:56:21.451 --> 00:56:22.884
I'll always love you

1381
00:56:22.952 --> 00:56:24.214
Thanks, Dad

1382
00:56:24.287 --> 00:56:25.515
but I'm not gay

1383
00:56:25.588 --> 00:56:27.021
What do you think?

1384
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:28.523
Hell, I don't know

1385
00:56:28.591 --> 00:56:30.525
Renee called and told me
the story


1386
00:56:30.593 --> 00:56:32.493
It sure as hell sounds
like he could be


1387
00:56:32.562 --> 00:56:33.961
He says he isn't,

1388
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:36.396
but you kids are all so fucking nuts,
it wouldn't surprise me


1389
00:56:36.466 --> 00:56:38.058
I don't think you have
to worry about it


1390
00:56:38.134 --> 00:56:40.227
If anybody would know,
I would He's not gay


1391
00:56:40.303 --> 00:56:41.964
The kid wears cologne,
for Christ's sake


1392
00:56:42.038 --> 00:56:43.562
Get the hell out of here

1393
00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.904
I mean, come on, Fran,
you're kind of prissy, all right?


1394
00:56:45.975 --> 00:56:47.909
I mean, you like cooking,
clothing, and furniture


1395
00:56:47.977 --> 00:56:50.912
And, I mean, you wear that
frigging cologne, so, you know


1396
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.413
Oh, that's brilliant, Mick

1397
00:56:52.482 --> 00:56:53.915
That makes me gay?

1398
00:56:53.983 --> 00:56:55.245
No, I'm just saying

1399
00:56:55.318 --> 00:56:57.411
some people might read you
as less than straight


1400
00:56:57.487 --> 00:56:59.011
And if you are,
I'm your brother,


1401
00:56:59.088 --> 00:57:00.612
and I'll always
love you, sweet boy


1402
00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:03.124
H
-Hold on a sec, OK?

1403
00:57:03.193 --> 00:57:06.128
J-just stop and give me
a minute here


1404
00:57:06.196 --> 00:57:08.858
And look at this maleness

1405
00:57:08.932 --> 00:57:11.366
How could you
possibly think I am gay?


1406
00:57:11.434 --> 00:57:13.868
Because you don't look
at me anymore,


1407
00:57:13.937 --> 00:57:15.370
let alone touch me

1408
00:57:15.438 --> 00:57:18.373
How many times
do I have to remind you?


1409
00:57:18.441 --> 00:57:20.375
If you mention that goddamned
down cycle one more time,


1410
00:57:20.443 --> 00:57:21.410
I swear to God,

1411
00:57:21.477 --> 00:57:23.877
I will cut that maleness
right off, OK?


1412
00:57:23.947 --> 00:57:26.882
It's just not natural for you
to not want to have sex your wife


1413
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:28.884
at least once
in the last three months!


1414
00:57:28.952 --> 00:57:30.886
Whoa, whoa
Why is it my fault?!


1415
00:57:30.954 --> 00:57:32.888
Maybe it's your fault!
Did you ever think about that?


1416
00:57:32.956 --> 00:57:33.888
Excuse me?!

1417
00:57:33.957 --> 00:57:35.891
How could this be my fault, huh?

1418
00:57:35.959 --> 00:57:37.392
I went out there,

1419
00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.394
and I bought
all that lingerie crap,


1420
00:57:39.462 --> 00:57:41.896
and you didn't even
look at me!


1421
00:57:41.965 --> 00:57:43.899
Was I not working
that night?


1422
00:57:43.967 --> 00:57:45.901
I'm sorry Do you
remember this at all?


1423
00:57:45.969 --> 00:57:47.402
Maybe

1424
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:49.404
Maybe you've got a problem
or something


1425
00:57:49.472 --> 00:57:51.406
I mean, do you think
you're impotent?


1426
00:57:51.474 --> 00:57:52.406
What?

1427
00:57:52.475 --> 00:57:53.407
No

1428
00:57:54.978 --> 00:57:56.411
Well, maybe

1429
00:57:58.982 --> 00:58:00.415
maybe you caught

1430
00:58:00.483 --> 00:58:02.417
some, like,
disease or something


1431
00:58:02.485 --> 00:58:04.419
Oh, yeah
That's it, babe

Honey, if you're
a homosexual,


1435
00:58:10.927 --> 00:58:12.861
you can tell me, OK?

1436
00:58:12.929 --> 00:58:15.363
I will understand
I won't be mad


1437
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:17.365
But you got to talk to me

1438
00:58:17.433 --> 00:58:18.559
Listen,

1439
00:58:18.635 --> 00:58:20.865
will you cut it out with
the homosexual business?


1440
00:58:20.937 --> 00:58:23.531
It's getting me all skeeved out
every time you say it


1441
00:58:23.606 --> 00:58:25.870
Fine You want
to know what's wrong?


1442
00:58:25.942 --> 00:58:27.876
I'll just come right out
and say it

Please! I would

I'm in love
with someone else

OK?

1452
00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.413
It's a she

She's a woman

She's a beautiful, intelligent,
sophisticated woman

What does that make me?

1457

I'm sorry, I didn't
mean it like that


1458
00:59:22.932 --> 00:59:24.365
It wasn't a comparison

He's seeing another woman,
and he wants a divorce

Well, I guess
you can go ahead


1467
00:59:46.956 --> 00:59:48.890
and send her
your vibrator


1468

She's gonna need it

1469

Ohhhh

1470
00:59:58.334 --> 00:59:59.767
Your father scares me

I don't think
he likes me


1472
01:00:01.804 --> 01:00:03.897
Hope, I'm telling you
he likes you, OK?


1473
01:00:03.973 --> 01:00:06.339
Just the other day, he was telling me
how sweet he thinks you are

I don't know

There's just something
I don't like about her


1476
01:00:09.512 --> 01:00:11.446
She's kind of stuck up,
don't you think?


1477
01:00:11.514 --> 01:00:14.005
No, not at all I mean,
she's shy with new people, that's all

He seemed to get upset when I told him
I don't talk to my parents anymore


1480
01:00:18.588 --> 01:00:20.180
Now I know you're
being paranoid,


1481
01:00:20.256 --> 01:00:22.656
because the guy hated his father,
and he didn't speak to him for years


1482
01:00:22.725 --> 01:00:25.353

cuts their parents off?

Don't give me that load
of horse shit


1485

Nobody was a meaner son
of a bitch than my old man,


1486
01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:32.930
but I was there for him
until the day he died


1487
01:00:33.002 --> 01:00:35.368
So he doesn't think
I tricked you into this?


1488
01:00:35.438 --> 01:00:37.372
Granted, he thinks
we're nuts, but he said,

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.931
"As long as you're in love,
who cares what anyone else thinks"


1490
01:00:40.009 --> 01:00:42.375
You didn't give a shit
what anybody else thought, did you?


1491
01:00:42.445 --> 01:00:44.379
You ought to hear
what people are saying

you got this girl pregnant

for that announcement

Dad, I knew her for 24 hours
before we got married, OK?


1496
01:00:51.454 --> 01:00:53.388
I didn't have time
to get her pregnant

And your brother and I
think she's an illegal

This guy's 60 years old

1561
01:03:32.315 --> 01:03:35.250
He wants to spend the rest of his life
on that boat, he should be allowed


1562
01:03:35.318 --> 01:03:36.580
Yeah, what about Mom?

1563
01:03:36.652 --> 01:03:38.916
What should she do,
sit around here and wait for him?


1564
01:03:38.988 --> 01:03:40.421
It's his life, Mick

1565
01:03:47.997 --> 01:03:49.430
Are you OK?

1566
01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:53.763
Yeah

1567
01:03:59.342 --> 01:04:01.606
I'm sorry about that
in there


1568
01:04:01.677 --> 01:04:04.942
Me and the missus haven't been
seeing eye to eye these days


1569
01:04:07.283 --> 01:04:08.545
Well

1570
01:04:08.618 --> 01:04:10.552
34 years we've been
together


1571
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.053
I guess things change

1572
01:04:16.459 --> 01:04:17.551
[Chuckles]

1573
01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:19.060
So, uh, Mickey tells me

1574
01:04:19.128 --> 01:04:20.891
you kids are moving
to Paris


1575
01:04:20.963 --> 01:04:22.897
Yeah I'm going
to the Sorbonne


1576
01:04:22.965 --> 01:04:23.897
How come?

1577
01:04:23.966 --> 01:04:24.898
For my PhD

1578
01:04:24.967 --> 01:04:26.400
Ohh

1579
01:04:26.469 --> 01:04:28.403
Yeah, you look French

1580
01:04:28.471 --> 01:04:30.200
Uh, European

1581
01:04:31.974 --> 01:04:33.407
Or, uh

1582
01:04:33.476 --> 01:04:35.410
maybe from one of the islands

1583
01:04:35.478 --> 01:04:36.410
Oh, yeah?

1584
01:04:36.479 --> 01:04:37.741
What islands?

1585
01:04:39.982 --> 01:04:41.916
Oh, I don't know

1586
01:04:41.984 --> 01:04:43.747
So, where are you from?

1587
01:04:43.819 --> 01:04:44.911
Vermont

1588
01:04:44.987 --> 01:04:46.420
Ohh

1589
01:04:46.489 --> 01:04:48.116
So you're
an American citizen?


1590
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:49.122
Yeah

1591
01:04:49.191 --> 01:04:50.123
Yeah

1592
01:04:50.192 --> 01:04:51.591
Good

1593
01:04:51.661 --> 01:04:53.094
You know, it's funny

1594
01:04:53.162 --> 01:04:55.426
Mrs. Fitzpatrick...
my wife...


1595
01:04:55.498 --> 01:04:57.932
she found out
Mickey got married,


1596
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.491
she was understandably
upset, you know?


1597
01:05:00.569 --> 01:05:03.436
She thought it might be
some sort of shotgun wedding,


1598
01:05:03.506 --> 01:05:06.304
seeing as we've never
seen you before


1599
01:05:10.946 --> 01:05:13.312
So there's nothing
you want to tell me?


1600
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:15.382
No

1601
01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:17.009
'Cause if you are pregnant,

1602
01:05:17.086 --> 01:05:18.519
I mean, that's fine

1603
01:05:18.587 --> 01:05:20.714
You know, I always thought
it'd be nice


1604
01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:22.883
to have a few grandkids
running around the house


1605
01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:25.392
Thought maybe Franny and Renee
would give me a few,


1606
01:05:25.461 --> 01:05:27.224
but that didn't work out

1607
01:05:29.965 --> 01:05:31.398
What about you?

1608
01:05:31.467 --> 01:05:33.901
Thanks, but, no,
I'm not pregnant


1609
01:05:33.969 --> 01:05:34.901
Oh, OK

1610
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:36.403
Ah, God

1611
01:05:36.472 --> 01:05:39.236
And you are
an American citizen?


1612
01:05:39.308 --> 01:05:40.900
Last time I checked

1613
01:05:40.976 --> 01:05:42.068
Yeah, yeah

1614
01:05:42.144 --> 01:05:43.577
I thought so

1615
01:05:44.814 --> 01:05:46.839
Tell me where you got it

1616
01:05:46.916 --> 01:05:47.940
Why?

1617
01:05:48.017 --> 01:05:49.917
Francis, just tell me
where you got it, OK?


1618
01:05:49.985 --> 01:05:51.919
I told you before
It was a gift


1619
01:05:51.987 --> 01:05:54.421
Yeah, yeah I know that
From who though?


1620
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:56.424
What's the big deal?
It's a watch


1621
01:05:56.492 --> 01:05:59.427
The big deal is it looks
a hell of a lot


1622
01:05:59.495 --> 01:06:01.429
like a watch
I used to own, OK?


1623
01:06:01.497 --> 01:06:02.930
What does that mean?

1624
01:06:02.998 --> 01:06:05.933
Just tell me where you got
the fucking watch, asshole, all right?


1625
01:06:06.001 --> 01:06:07.866
I don't have to tell you anything

1626
01:06:07.937 --> 01:06:10.371
Listen to me, Francis, that watch
on your wrist is my old watch


1627
01:06:10.439 --> 01:06:13.374
When I went to get my TV from Heather,
I gave her the watch


1628
01:06:13.442 --> 01:06:14.875
Now you're wearing the watch

1629
01:06:14.944 --> 01:06:17.378
What I want to know is why
the fuck are you wearing my watch?


1630
01:06:17.446 --> 01:06:18.879
OK

1631
01:06:19.949 --> 01:06:21.382
Heather gave it to me

1632
01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:22.883
Yeah, no shit, Dick Tracy

1633
01:06:22.952 --> 01:06:24.886
But what I want to know is why

1634
01:06:24.954 --> 01:06:27.218
Listen, Mick,
it's a long story


1635
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:31.225
I should've told you before

1636
01:06:33.462 --> 01:06:35.896
I should've told you
before, but...


1637
01:06:35.965 --> 01:06:37.694
'Cause I didn't know how

1638
01:06:37.767 --> 01:06:40.429
Yeah, you've been having a lot of
trouble lately with that, haven't you?


1639
01:06:46.976 --> 01:06:49.240
The woman
I've been seeing


1640
01:06:50.813 --> 01:06:51.905
is Heather

1641
01:06:51.981 --> 01:06:53.243
My Heather

1642
01:06:54.984 --> 01:06:56.918
No My Heather

1643
01:06:56.986 --> 01:06:58.419
You're having sex
with my Heather?


1644
01:06:58.487 --> 01:06:59.419
My ex-fiancée

1645
01:06:59.488 --> 01:07:00.887
That bitch who broke my heart

1646
01:07:00.956 --> 01:07:02.218
Francis:
I love her, Mick


1647
01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:03.223
Mick: No, you don't

1648
01:07:03.292 --> 01:07:04.418
Yes, I do

1649
01:07:04.493 --> 01:07:05.858
Let's get this straight, OK?

1650
01:07:05.928 --> 01:07:07.259
You do not love
my ex-fiancée


1651
01:07:07.329 --> 01:07:08.387
Can you understand that?

1652
01:07:08.464 --> 01:07:10.898
Francis: No
You get this straight


1653
01:07:10.966 --> 01:07:12.661
I'm going to marry her, Mick

1654
01:07:12.735 --> 01:07:15.363
You... What the fuck are you
talking about? You're gonna marry her?


1655
01:07:15.437 --> 01:07:17.371
You don't even know her,
you fucking moron!


1656
01:07:17.439 --> 01:07:18.872
What the hell's
going on here?!


1657
01:07:18.941 --> 01:07:20.374
You know why this skell
is leaving Renee?


1658
01:07:20.442 --> 01:07:22.376
'Cause he's screwing
around with Heather


1659
01:07:22.444 --> 01:07:23.877
the whore

1660
01:07:23.946 --> 01:07:25.379
Don't call her a whore

1661
01:07:25.447 --> 01:07:27.711
Hey, man, I'll call her whatever
the fuck I want to call her


1662
01:07:27.783 --> 01:07:29.876
You're my brother, man
What the hell are you doing?


1663
01:07:29.952 --> 01:07:31.886
What do you got
to say for yourself?


1664
01:07:31.954 --> 01:07:33.387
Fuck him

1665
01:07:33.455 --> 01:07:35.389
I know why
he's really pissed


1666
01:07:35.457 --> 01:07:37.391
Don't even go there, bitch

1667
01:07:37.459 --> 01:07:39.893
I should kick your ass for
calling my girl a whore


1668
01:07:39.962 --> 01:07:41.896
Oh, now she's your girl
You hear this?


1669
01:07:41.964 --> 01:07:43.397
Yeah, she's my girl

1670
01:07:43.465 --> 01:07:45.399
And I'm gonna kick
your fucking ass


1671
01:07:45.467 --> 01:07:48.402
How do you like that, Mr.
Loser-Cab-Driver-Can't-Afford-A-New-TV?


1672
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:49.402
All right, ladies!

1673
01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:51.769
OK, let's take this
outside Come on


1674
01:07:51.841 --> 01:07:54.776
I hope you realize
how stupid you all look


1675
01:07:54.844 --> 01:07:56.004
You're grown men

1676
01:07:56.078 --> 01:07:57.670
You're supposed
to be brothers


1677
01:07:57.746 --> 01:07:59.236
Sorry, Hope,

1678
01:07:59.315 --> 01:08:02.409
but sometimes this is the only way
you can solve these things


1679
01:08:02.484 --> 01:08:03.815
OK, girls

1680
01:08:04.987 --> 01:08:07.217
Uh-uh I'm not gonna
fight you, Fran


1681
01:08:07.289 --> 01:08:08.551
I know that, Mick

1682
01:08:08.624 --> 01:08:10.524
I'm gonna beat you
You're gonna bleed


1683
01:08:10.593 --> 01:08:11.958
Don't worry
It shouldn't take long


1684
01:08:12.027 --> 01:08:13.517
We got to do this?

1685
01:08:13.596 --> 01:08:15.530
I mean, with the gloves
and everything?


1686
01:08:15.598 --> 01:08:17.361
What, are we
in fifth grade again?


1687
01:08:17.433 --> 01:08:19.867
Oh, you should have thought of that
before you called her a whore


1688
01:08:19.935 --> 01:08:21.197
He's right
Now, come on


1689
01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:23.204
No punching below the belt,
no kicking,


1690
01:08:23.272 --> 01:08:24.534
and, Francis, no biting

1691
01:08:24.607 --> 01:08:25.539
Let's go

1692
01:08:25.608 --> 01:08:27.132
May the best man win

1693
01:08:27.209 --> 01:08:29.040
25 fucking years
I've been waiting


1694
01:08:29.111 --> 01:08:31.045
for the day I'd be
bigger, tougher,


1695
01:08:31.113 --> 01:08:32.546
stronger than you

1696
01:08:32.615 --> 01:08:34.378
When you go down
it's gonna hurt, baby


1697
01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:36.384
I'm gonna kick
your fucking ass


1698
01:08:36.452 --> 01:08:38.386
You ready?
You ready to be humiliated


1699
01:08:38.454 --> 01:08:40.547
in front of your new wife
and your father?


1700
01:08:40.623 --> 01:08:42.557
You are an ugly bitch
I pity you


1701
01:08:46.795 --> 01:08:48.228
Great punch, Mick

1702
01:08:48.297 --> 01:08:50.288
You always did
have a great right


1703
01:09:02.478 --> 01:09:03.911
Come on, Dorothy

1704
01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:05.571
It's all over

1705
01:09:16.558 --> 01:09:17.490
Hey

1706
01:09:17.559 --> 01:09:18.491
Hey

1707
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.993
How you doing?

1708
01:09:20.062 --> 01:09:20.994
Not bad

1709
01:09:21.063 --> 01:09:22.860
What happened to you?

1710
01:09:24.934 --> 01:09:26.868
I told Mickey about us

1711
01:09:26.936 --> 01:09:28.870
One punch?

1712
01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.874
It was a cheap shot

1713
01:09:36.812 --> 01:09:39.372
Hey, Hope, this had nothing
to do with Heather, OK?


1714
01:09:39.448 --> 01:09:41.382
I mean, this had to do
with me and Fran


1715
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:44.385
You know, he's tried to turn
our entire lives into a competition


1716
01:09:44.453 --> 01:09:45.886
That was just another
way of him saying,


1717
01:09:45.955 --> 01:09:47.388
"Fuck you, Mickey I won"

1718
01:09:47.456 --> 01:09:48.889
Well, I don't buy it, Mick

1719
01:09:48.958 --> 01:09:51.392
Something else
was going on there,


1720
01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.893
and you know it

1721
01:09:52.962 --> 01:09:54.224
Listen, Hope,

1722
01:09:54.296 --> 01:09:57.231
you know, I don't know
what to tell you, all right?


1723
01:09:57.299 --> 01:09:59.893
I mean, that's what
it was about


1724
01:10:04.974 --> 01:10:06.839
I'm gonna go take a shower

1725
01:10:12.848 --> 01:10:14.247
Does it hurt?

1726
01:10:14.316 --> 01:10:15.248
No, no

1727
01:10:15.317 --> 01:10:16.249
It's fine

1728
01:10:16.318 --> 01:10:17.842
Listen

1729
01:10:19.588 --> 01:10:21.522
I've got something for you

1730
01:10:23.425 --> 01:10:25.256
What's this?

1731
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:29.522
Will you marry me?

1732
01:10:30.632 --> 01:10:32.862
You have to get
divorced first, Fran


1733
01:10:32.935 --> 01:10:34.368
Well, yeah

1734
01:10:34.436 --> 01:10:36.370
Sure, but

1735
01:10:36.438 --> 01:10:38.872
Well, this will be
like a pre-divorce,


1736
01:10:38.941 --> 01:10:42.843
pre-engagement
engagement ring


1737
01:10:42.911 --> 01:10:44.208
Open it

1738
01:10:51.954 --> 01:10:53.387
Fran

1739
01:10:54.957 --> 01:10:56.618
you didn't have
to do this


1740
01:11:00.963 --> 01:11:04.194
Come here,
you poor little thing


1741
01:11:09.405 --> 01:11:10.963
So?

1742
01:11:12.908 --> 01:11:14.808
Why are you doing this?

1743
01:11:17.579 --> 01:11:19.376
Because I love you

1744
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:24.344
Can I have some time
to think about it?


1745
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:27.183
Yeah

1746
01:11:29.591 --> 01:11:31.024
I'm not going anywhere

1747
01:11:46.442 --> 01:11:47.374
You know, Mick,

1748
01:11:47.443 --> 01:11:49.877
I got to side with Hope
on this one


1749
01:11:49.945 --> 01:11:51.879
You had no reason
to be pissed at Franny


1750
01:11:51.947 --> 01:11:53.380
Are you kidding me, Dad?

1751
01:11:53.449 --> 01:11:55.383
Hey, don't think
for a second


1752
01:11:55.451 --> 01:11:57.885
I can't still knock you
on your ass, OK?


1753
01:11:57.953 --> 01:12:00.751
Sorry But, I mean,
you know what Fran was up to


1754
01:12:00.823 --> 01:12:03.348
My entire life he's been pulling
crap like this with me


1755
01:12:03.425 --> 01:12:05.552
Let me tell you something
You're no different


1756
01:12:05.627 --> 01:12:07.754
You wouldn't have been standing
out in the backyard


1757
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:09.821
with the gloves on if you were

1758
01:12:09.898 --> 01:12:12.332
And if you don't believe me,

1759
01:12:12.401 --> 01:12:13.834
let me refresh your memory

1760
01:12:13.902 --> 01:12:15.733
Little League
You're 12, he's 11


1761
01:12:15.804 --> 01:12:17.738
He's pitching, you're at bat

1762
01:12:17.806 --> 01:12:20.832
He's got a full count
on his big brother...


1763
01:12:20.909 --> 01:12:22.035
his idol

1764
01:12:22.111 --> 01:12:24.841
If he strikes you out,
he's the hero


1765
01:12:24.913 --> 01:12:26.847
What does he do?

1766
01:12:26.915 --> 01:12:30.009
He throws you a meatball
right down the middle


1767
01:12:31.253 --> 01:12:33.187
If you take it
and go down looking,


1768
01:12:33.255 --> 01:12:34.745
you make Franny the hero

1769
01:12:34.823 --> 01:12:36.347
But you swing away

1770
01:12:56.479 --> 01:12:57.411
Hey

1771
01:13:02.018 --> 01:13:03.451
So

1772
01:13:03.519 --> 01:13:04.816
how we doing?

1773
01:13:04.887 --> 01:13:06.912
You tell me

1774
01:13:08.457 --> 01:13:11.392
Well, you know,
I want to apologize for the other night


1775
01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:14.429
I think this whole thing
is crazy and stupid


1776
01:13:14.497 --> 01:13:16.431
But it's like

1777
01:13:16.499 --> 01:13:17.557
you know

1778
01:13:17.633 --> 01:13:19.897
I'm... I'm a little confused

1779
01:13:19.969 --> 01:13:21.834
So, how's your friend Heather?

1780
01:13:23.639 --> 01:13:25.004
Wouldn't know

1781
01:13:26.475 --> 01:13:27.908
Well, look, Mick

1782
01:13:27.977 --> 01:13:30.912
I've been doing
some thinking and, uh


1783
01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.914
who were we kidding?

1784
01:13:32.982 --> 01:13:35.416
We only knew one another
for a few hours


1785
01:13:35.484 --> 01:13:37.247
There's no way that
was going to work, right?


1786
01:13:38.921 --> 01:13:41.412
I mean, I don't know
if I'd say that


1787
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:44.357
It's just, you know, when you brought up
the whole Paris thing,


1788
01:13:44.427 --> 01:13:46.088
it kind of threw me, you know?

1789
01:13:46.162 --> 01:13:47.424
I don't know

1790
01:13:47.496 --> 01:13:49.430
You're using that
as an excuse


1791
01:13:49.498 --> 01:13:52.331
We both know what's
really going on here


1792
01:13:56.005 --> 01:13:58.439
I'm leaving for Paris on Monday,

1793
01:13:58.507 --> 01:14:01.476
and I think it's best
if I go alone


1794
01:14:03.512 --> 01:14:05.776
Um, you... you sure
about that?


1795
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:09.713
No, but

1796
01:14:09.785 --> 01:14:11.719
I've made up my mind

1797
01:14:23.632 --> 01:14:25.395
What did he say?

1798
01:14:25.468 --> 01:14:26.730
Not much

1799
01:14:28.471 --> 01:14:30.405
Did he fight for you?

1800
01:14:30.473 --> 01:14:31.906
No

1801
01:14:31.974 --> 01:14:33.236
Not really

1802
01:14:33.309 --> 01:14:34.401
Oh

1803
01:14:34.477 --> 01:14:36.570
What are you going
to do about Paris?


1804
01:14:36.645 --> 01:14:38.579
You going to go alone?

1805
01:14:38.647 --> 01:14:39.909
Yeah

1806
01:14:46.989 --> 01:14:48.422
Hiya, Fran

1807
01:14:48.491 --> 01:14:49.924
Hey, Mick

1808
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.094
What are you doing here?

1809
01:14:53.162 --> 01:14:56.097
What, I can't come by
to see my little brother?


1810
01:15:07.276 --> 01:15:08.208
So?

1811
01:15:08.277 --> 01:15:09.710
So, what happened, huh?

1812
01:15:09.778 --> 01:15:12.372
Out of all the thousands
of women in Manhattan


1813
01:15:12.448 --> 01:15:14.882
you just happened to fall
in love with Heather?


1814
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:16.383
Mick, that's not
how it happened


1815
01:15:16.452 --> 01:15:18.386
We both work on Wall Street

1816
01:15:18.454 --> 01:15:19.887
We run in similar circles

1817
01:15:19.955 --> 01:15:21.889
Oh, Jesus
Give me a break, Fran


1818
01:15:21.957 --> 01:15:23.891
What, do you think
I'm a moron?


1819
01:15:23.959 --> 01:15:25.893
I'm your brother, man
What were you thinking?


1820
01:15:25.961 --> 01:15:27.895
You just had
to go after her, right?


1821
01:15:27.963 --> 01:15:29.396
It wasn't like that, Mick!

1822
01:15:29.465 --> 01:15:30.898
What is your problem anyway?

1823
01:15:30.966 --> 01:15:32.558
You're still in love
with this woman?


1824
01:15:32.635 --> 01:15:34.068
Is that why this bothers you?

1825
01:15:34.136 --> 01:15:36.070
No, it has nothing
to do with that, OK?


1826
01:15:36.138 --> 01:15:38.072
We're not in competition
anymore, Fran


1827
01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.074
Look at your life, man
You won already


1828
01:15:40.142 --> 01:15:41.575
You got the big apartment,

1829
01:15:41.644 --> 01:15:43.077
You got the nicer clothes

1830
01:15:43.145 --> 01:15:44.908
You're Mr. Big-Swinging-
Dick-Around-Town


1831
01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.140
What more do you want?

1832
01:15:46.215 --> 01:15:48.240
Maybe he just wants
to be happy


1833
01:15:50.986 --> 01:15:52.419
Oh, to be happy Really?

1834
01:15:52.488 --> 01:15:53.921
Oh, that's...
that's great


1835
01:15:53.989 --> 01:15:57.288
Yeah, well, who am I to get in the way
of this... What was it?


1836
01:15:57.359 --> 01:15:58.986
"Happiness"

1837
01:15:59.061 --> 01:16:01.928
Franny obviously
hasn't told you yet


1838
01:16:03.999 --> 01:16:05.933
Told me what?

1839
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:11.365
Your brother's asked me
to marry him


1840
01:16:15.611 --> 01:16:16.873
Great

1841
01:16:16.946 --> 01:16:18.379
Great That's terrific

1842
01:16:18.447 --> 01:16:20.381
Hey, congratulations

1843
01:16:20.449 --> 01:16:22.007
Thank you

1844
01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.560
Hey, are you out
of your fucking mind?


1845
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:35.563
Don't start with me, Mick

1846
01:16:35.631 --> 01:16:36.563
I love her

1847
01:16:36.632 --> 01:16:38.395
Hey, hey
No, you don't, OK?


1848
01:16:38.467 --> 01:16:40.492
You don't love her
because she's unlovable


1849
01:16:40.569 --> 01:16:42.901
Oh, so you didn't
love her now?


1850
01:16:42.972 --> 01:16:44.906
Yeah, I did, but that
was a long time ago,


1851
01:16:44.974 --> 01:16:47.408
and I was a stupid jerk-off
who thought he could change her


1852
01:16:47.476 --> 01:16:49.410
Yeah, well, I don't
want to change her


1853
01:16:49.478 --> 01:16:51.412
That's 'cause you don't
know her, Fran


1854
01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.414
Ohh Oh, I don't know her OK

1855
01:16:53.482 --> 01:16:55.416
Franny, listen to me,
all right?


1856
01:16:55.484 --> 01:16:56.451
I mean

1857
01:16:56.518 --> 01:16:58.418
I didn't want to have
to tell you this,


1858
01:16:58.487 --> 01:17:00.421
but if you're going
to marry this girl,


1859
01:17:00.489 --> 01:17:02.423
there's a lot about her
you should know


1860
01:17:02.491 --> 01:17:04.425
Drop it Because there's
nothing you can say


1861
01:17:04.493 --> 01:17:06.859
that's gonna change the way
I feel about her, OK, Mick?


1862
01:17:06.929 --> 01:17:07.896
Listen, Franny,

1863
01:17:07.963 --> 01:17:10.363
don't be so sure
about that, all right?


1864
01:17:11.767 --> 01:17:13.200
When she was, um

1865
01:17:13.269 --> 01:17:15.863
When she was in college,
she, uh


1866
01:17:15.938 --> 01:17:18.372
you know, paid her way
through school by


1867
01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.374
You know, she was a

1868
01:17:20.442 --> 01:17:22.205
She was a call girl

1869
01:17:25.447 --> 01:17:27.540
What do you mean
"a call girl"?


1870
01:17:27.616 --> 01:17:29.049
I mean, you call a service,

1871
01:17:29.118 --> 01:17:30.551
they send her over,
she does her thing...


1872
01:17:30.619 --> 01:17:32.553
Whoa Whoa
What are you saying?


1873
01:17:32.621 --> 01:17:34.054
Like a hooker?

1874
01:17:34.123 --> 01:17:36.057
No no, not like
a hooker


1875
