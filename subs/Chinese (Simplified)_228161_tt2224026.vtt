87
00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:38.174

等你有空了再去

144
00:11:54.342 --> 00:11:56.470
不要发 我空闲了也不会去
Please do not send. I enjoy my leisure minute.


145
00:11:56.636 --> 00:11:59.640

你把地址发送给每个人?
You sent directions to everyone?


148
00:12:08.314 --> 00:12:10.362
什么? 这不是我的错
What? It is not my fault.


149
00:12:10.983 --> 00:12:14.453
为什么"发送"旁边有个"全体发送"?
Why for put "send" button right next to "send all"?


150
00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:16.121
一不小心就会按错的
This is just bad design.


151
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.330
你的邀请发送给了全银河系!
Your invite has been sent to entire galaxy!


152
00:12:20.827 --> 00:12:21.827
惨了
Uh-oh.


153
00:12:21.869 --> 00:12:23.587
的确惨了!
"Uh-oh" is right!


154
00:12:23.746 --> 00:12:26.215
我们敌人瓜星人也会收到...
Our enemy, the Gorg, will receive it...


155

他们会找到我们的!

156
00:12:29.127 --> 00:12:30.424
瓜星人?

157
00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:39.391
伐嗒!
Fa-da!


158
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.979
你将会毁了我们波星人的!
You have doomed our species!


159
00:12:45.143 --> 00:12:45.939
不 别
No, please.


160
00:12:46.102 --> 00:12:48.275
我不是故意的 我很抱歉!

00:12:51.482 --> 00:12:53.155
我只是想邀请你去...

164
00:12:56.946 --> 00:12:58.163
安全受到威胁

165
00:12:58.322 --> 00:13:00.040
逮捕那个波星人!

166
00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:03.541
自动飞行器 我需要帮助!
Autopilot, I needs help!


167
00:13:03.703 --> 00:13:07.048
巴黎的波星人总部有各种帮助服务
Help is available in Paris at Boov Headquarters.


168
00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:09.550
不! 别去巴黎!
No, Autopilot! Any place but Paris!


169
00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:12.053
你必须带我去一个没有波星人的地方
You must takes me to a place with no Boovs.


170
00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:16.053
这个星球没有波星人的地方是南极
The only remaining spot on planet with no Boov is Antarctica.


171
00:13:17.842 --> 00:13:19.139
来抱一个!

172
00:13:21.304 --> 00:13:24.057
好的! 南极不错! 带我去那!
Yes! Antarctica is perfect! Take me there now!


173
00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:28.019
不好意思 您是波星人逃犯
I am sorry. You are fugitive Boov.


174
00:13:28.186 --> 00:13:29.688
开启自毁程序

175
00:13:29.854 --> 00:13:31.527
不! 别开启!
No! Do not initiate!


176
00:13:31.689 --> 00:13:32.986
我不是逃犯!
I am not a fugitive!


177
00:13:48.414 --> 00:13:49.414

00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:12.863
哦不
Oh, no.


179
00:15:29.265 --> 00:15:31.688
逮住你啦!
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!


180
00:15:33.853 --> 00:15:35.446
为什么把我关起来?

我是波星人 所有人爱戴的

183
00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:43.029
好极了! 那我能出来吗?

184
00:15:43.195 --> 00:15:45.618
不 你不能出来
No, you cannot "come into the out" now.


185
00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:48.159
你永远都关在里面吧!
You can never come into the out, ever again!


186
00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:50.336
我能出来!
But I can!


187
00:15:50.494 --> 00:15:53.373
只要你把那条木杆拿走
You are just having to take away the piece of wood.


188
00:15:54.624 --> 00:15:57.047
不然我只好...
Then I will have to...


189
00:15:57.209 --> 00:16:01.385
从眼睛里射出镭射激光了!
I will shoot forth the lasers from my eyeballs!


190
00:16:02.465 --> 00:16:03.808
你能吗?
You can do that?


191
00:16:05.134 --> 00:16:06.681
当然
Yes.


192
00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:13.894
如果你能射激光 那我没办法只好...
If you shoot your eye lasers, then I'll have no choice...


193
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.562
让你脑袋爆炸了!
but to explode your head!


194
00:16:15.728 --> 00:16:18.481
- 你们人类不能让...  - 我们可以!
- You humans cannot to explode...  - We can too!


195
00:16:18.648 --> 00:16:19.991
只是不经常用
We just don't much.


196
00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:21.366
那样很没礼貌
It's considered rude.


197
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:25.492
那我们停战吧
Then I am granting you a truce.


198
00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:27.657
你不用爆我的头...
You are not to exploding heads...


199
00:16:27.823 --> 00:16:30.747
我也不用我的毁灭激光
and I will not do my devastating eye lasers.


200
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:35.877
好吧 停战
Okay. Truce.


201
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.758
- 那我能出来了吗?  - 不!
- So, can I come into the out now?  - No!


202
00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:41.842
这是你们偷别人星球 绑架家人的惩罚
This is what you get for stealing planets and abducting people.


203
00:16:42.004 --> 00:16:43.597
这是一个误会
You are thinking a mistake.


204
00:16:43.756 --> 00:16:46.054
波星人从不偷窃和绑架
Boov do not steal and abduct.


205
00:16:46.217 --> 00:16:49.061
波星人解放人们 和人们交朋友
No, Boov liberate and befriend.


206
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.603
猜猜谁做的!
Guess who made this one!


207
00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:55.518
好漂亮!
This is so beautiful!


208
00:16:57.353 --> 00:16:59.355
妈妈! 怎么了?
Mom! What's happening?


209
00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:00.614
我不知道 亲爱的
I don't know, honey.


210
00:17:03.275 --> 00:17:04.275
小钱!
Tip!


211
00:17:05.277 --> 00:17:06.620
会没事的
It will be okay.


212
00:17:09.782 --> 00:17:12.911
发现生命体 非人类 继续探索
Life form detected. Not human. Move along.


213
00:17:13.077 --> 00:17:15.796
在送你们去人类镇的旅途中...
Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened bovine secretion...


214
00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:18.299
请品尝波星人牌冰淇淋
as we take this short flight to Happy Humanstown.


215
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:20.133
妈妈!
Mom!


216
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:25.594
都是你们的错
It's all your fault.


217
00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:27.929
你们绑架了我妈妈!
You stole my mom!


218
00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:30.807
再见了 波星人
Smell ya later, Boov.


219
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.597
别! 现在就见面吧!
Wait! Smell me now!


220
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.150
我可以修好你的车子 我看见你把它弄坏了
I can to fixing your car. I seen you has broken it.


221
00:17:36.308 --> 00:17:38.982
我没有弄坏它 我开车可溜了
I didn't break it. I'm a very good driver.


222
00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:41.614
它漏油是正常的
It's supposed to leak like that.


223
00:17:55.745 --> 00:17:57.964
我能出来了吗?
Can I come into the out now?


224
00:17:59.582 --> 00:18:04.008
我了解那个波星人逃犯又犯了弥天大错...
I know the fugitive Boov has made yet another in a series of horrible...


225
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.344
虽然不是故意的
yet unintentionally humorous mistakes.


226
00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:10.760
但我向你们保证 信号的传播已经...
But let me reassure you, the signal he broadcast...


227
00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:12.143
得到遏制
is being handled.


228
00:18:12.303 --> 00:18:15.682
我们还没有灭亡
We are definitely not doomed.


229
00:18:16.432 --> 00:18:18.981
- 结束直播  - 我们完啦!
- And we're out.  - We are doomed!


230
00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:21.312
瓜星人将会找到我们!
The Gorg are going to find us again!


231
00:18:21.479 --> 00:18:23.698
那个疯子波星人毁了一切
The maniac Boov has ruined everything.


232
00:18:23.856 --> 00:18:25.950
真糟糕
This is bad.


233
00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.950
距离送达时间: 38小时16分钟

234
00:18:29.528 --> 00:18:31.326
我真的挺爱这个星球的
And I really love this planet.


235
00:18:31.489 --> 00:18:33.742
看看他们有这么多好东西
Look at all the great stuff they've got.


236
00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:37.161
比如这个! 束发带!
Like this! A headband!


237
00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:40.377
如果你要晚礼服的话 你就让它滑下去...
And for evening wear, you slide it down...


238
00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:42.257
成功增肥一圈
you got a beautiful spare tire.


239
00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:43.416
我爱死它了!
I love it!


240
00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:44.714
太棒了!
Very nice!


241
00:18:44.877 --> 00:18:47.505
谁想离开这些东西呢? 我一定要解决这个麻烦
Who would wanna leave this behind? I have got to fix this.


242
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.006
我知道了!
I know!


243
00:18:49.173 --> 00:18:51.175
召集大头波星人
Summon the Big Brain Boovs.


244
00:18:51.342 --> 00:18:53.515
聪明的波星人中的精英
The smarty-pants of all smarty panty Booviness.


245
00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:55.596
先生们...
Gentleboov...


246
00:18:55.763 --> 00:18:57.561
给我出点主意
I want ideas.


247
00:18:59.975 --> 00:19:02.603
我们可以创造一个没有瓜星人的平行宇宙...
We could create an alternate reality with no Gorg in it...


248
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.522
然后搬到那里去
then go live there.


249
00:19:04.688 --> 00:19:06.907
太好了! 我喜欢!
Yes! I love it!


250
00:19:07.066 --> 00:19:08.318
大概需要多久?
How long would that take?


251
00:19:08.484 --> 00:19:10.486
根据我们现有的科技水平...
Based on our current technology...


252
00:19:12.404 --> 00:19:14.031
需要170万年

253
00:19:14.198 --> 00:19:16.951
这时间太长了 托尼 下一个!
That's a lot of years, Toni. Moving on!


254
00:19:17.117 --> 00:19:19.165
- 我们可以躺在地上...  - 然后呢!
- We could lay on the ground...  - Yes!


255
00:19:19.328 --> 00:19:22.502
这样瓜星人就会以为我们都死了
And make the Gorg think we are dead.


256
00:19:25.543 --> 00:19:26.760
下一个!
Next!


257
00:19:27.503 --> 00:19:29.847
我们能不能登陆逃犯波星人的电子邮箱...
What if we logged into the fugitive Boov's email...


258
00:19:30.005 --> 00:19:31.302
然后取消电子邀请函...
and cancelled his e-vite...


259
00:19:31.465 --> 00:19:34.935
嘘! 我们可以登陆逃犯波星人的电子邮箱...
Shush! Or we could log into the fugitive Boov's email...


260
00:19:35.094 --> 00:19:37.813
取消这个邀请函...
and cancel his invitation, and...


261
00:19:38.264 --> 00:19:39.060
然后什么?
What was that?


262
00:19:39.223 --> 00:19:40.770
这样瓜星人就不会收到它了
So the Gorg never receive it.


263
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:43.269
这样瓜星人就不会收到它了!
So the Gorg never receive it!


264
00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:47.406
现在 把密码输进去 然后取消信息吧
Now, type in the password and cancel that message.


265
00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:51.035
我真聪明 把所有的密码都设成了"mima"
It was a good idea of me to make all passwords "password."


266
00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:52.285
太好记了
It's so easy to remember.


267
00:19:53.696 --> 00:19:57.542
不对! 他的密码是独特的
It did not work! His password is unique.


268
00:19:58.158 --> 00:19:58.954
不!
No!


269
00:19:59.118 --> 00:20:02.497
独特? 波星人从来不是独特的!
Unique? Boov are not unique!


270
00:20:03.914 --> 00:20:05.166
把我的吸入器拿来
Fetch me my inhaler.


271
00:20:11.422 --> 00:20:13.049
天啊 这东西真有用
Boy, that works.


272
00:20:13.215 --> 00:20:15.468
他的错误正在把瓜星人引到我们这里来
His mistaking is leading the Gorg right to us.


273
00:20:15.634 --> 00:20:16.806
让我看看他的邀请函
Show me his invite.


274
00:20:18.178 --> 00:20:20.431
大家来参加我的聚会吧!
You are all invited to a party!


275
00:20:20.598 --> 00:20:21.770
只要到银河系来
Just head to the Milky Way.


276
00:20:21.932 --> 00:20:23.184
到北斗七星右转
Turn right at the Big Dipper.


277
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.647
从太阳开始第三个行星就是
Third planet from the Sun.


278
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.154
来找我的气球吧! 来聚会吧!
Look for my balloons! Party!


279
00:20:27.897 --> 00:20:29.945
如果想玩就来吧!

283
00:20:36.488 --> 00:20:37.535
凯尔!
Kyle!


284
00:20:37.948 --> 00:20:39.746
他不是我的朋友
He is not my friend.


285
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:42.037
互联网不会说谎!
The internet does not lie!


286
00:20:42.202 --> 00:20:43.920
你认识他 你能找到他的
You know him, you can find him.


287
00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:45.581
我要让你来负责!
I am putting you in charge!


288
00:20:45.748 --> 00:20:48.388
但 长官 这不是我的工作啊 我只是个中级交警
But, Captain, it is not my job. I am only a mid-level traffic Boov.


289
00:20:48.751 --> 00:20:50.719
- 我非常欣赏你这耸样 警官  - 谢谢
- I admire your cowardice, Officer.  - Thank you.


290
00:20:50.878 --> 00:20:55.179
但我要这个星球上所有的波星人警察都来搜这个城市
But I want every Boovcop on Planet Smekland searching this city.


291
00:20:55.382 --> 00:20:56.929
我们需要他的密码...
We need his password...


292
00:20:57.092 --> 00:21:00.312
否则我们就会被瓜星人消灭!
or we will all be destroyed by the Gorg!


293
00:21:00.471 --> 00:21:01.471
找到他!
Find him!


294
00:21:01.513 --> 00:21:05.643
不能让他再出岔子了
That Boov has made his final mistake.


295
00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:06.977
嗒哒!
Fa-da!


296
00:21:07.144 --> 00:21:08.896
你应该把它修好的!
You were supposed to fix it!


297
00:21:09.063 --> 00:21:10.189
这是什么?
What is this?


298
00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:12.450
这叫"雪泥感"
I calls it "Slushious."


299
00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:34.087
"雪泥感"?
"Slushious"?


300
00:21:34.129 --> 00:21:35.472
这当燃料太棒了...
It makes excellent fuel...


301
00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:37.258
而且这口味说上去还很好玩
and comes in fun-to-say flavors.


302
00:21:37.675 --> 00:21:38.675
"逃跑葡萄"
"Grape Escape."


303
00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:39.931
"红橘子旋转"
"Tangerine Twist."


304
00:21:40.094 --> 00:21:41.346
"混蛋柠檬"!
"Busta Lime"!


305
00:21:42.429 --> 00:21:43.681
老妈会杀了我的
Mom's gonna kill me.


306
00:21:43.847 --> 00:21:48.819
现在你可以用人类的传统方式 向我表示感谢了
Now I am prepared to accept one of your traditional gestures of human gratitude.


307
00:21:48.978 --> 00:21:52.323
其实我们的传统是打你的鼻子 别动
Actually, our tradition is to punch you in the nose. Hold still.


308
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:54.700
不用了! 我已感受到你的谢意
No! Your gratitude is implied.


309
00:21:57.236 --> 00:21:58.453
你可以先开

310
00:21:58.612 --> 00:21:59.989
然后我再...
Then I can...


311
00:22:00.155 --> 00:22:01.327
你别跟着我
You're not coming.


312
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.993
我要躲避波星人 我才不会让一个波星人在我身边呢
I'm trying to hide from the Boov. I'm not bringing one with me.


313
00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:05.376
你会把我交出去的
You'll just turn me in.


314
00:22:05.536 --> 00:22:07.584
不! 我只是需要你载我一程!
No! I just needs a ride!


315
00:22:07.746 --> 00:22:10.920
我在城的外面有要紧事要办
I haves official Boov business out of in town.


316
00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:12.083

317
00:22:12.793 --> 00:22:14.261
但我修好了你的车!
But I fixes your car!


318
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.639
那又怎样? 我把你从冰箱里放出来了 我们扯平了
So? I let you out of the freezer. We're even.


319
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.779
- 你对我的车做了什么?  - 什么意思?
- What did you do to my car?  - What doos you mean?


320
00:22:32.938 --> 00:22:34.406
它现在的悬浮性能应该更好了啊
It should to hover much better now.


321
00:22:34.565 --> 00:22:37.409
这是辆车 它以前从来不会悬浮呢
It's a car. It didn't hover at all before.


322
00:22:38.444 --> 00:22:40.117
怎么把这个关掉?
How do you stop this thing?


323
00:22:51.957 --> 00:22:56.463
哦 看来我把前进和后退的指令搞反了
Oops. I have apparently reversing the proceed and anti-proceed controls.

325
00:22:59.715 --> 00:23:00.967
- 油门就是刹车  - 等等!
- Go is stop.  - Wait!


326
00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:04.307
为什么你这么做? 波星人和人类是朋友!
Whyfor you do this? Boovs and humans are friends!


327
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.893
我们才不是朋友呢 你们绑架了我妈!
We're not friends. You kidnapped my mom!


328
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.152
谁是"我妈"?
Who is Mimom?


329
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:13.403
不 是"我的"妈妈!
No, "my" mom!


330
00:23:13.562 --> 00:23:14.905
我说什么了?
What did I say?


331
00:23:19.735 --> 00:23:21.487
- 我知道去哪找她  - 怎么找?
- I knows how to find her.  - How?


332
00:23:21.653 --> 00:23:24.202
波星人指挥中心有她在哪儿的信息

333
00:23:24.364 --> 00:23:26.037
- 在大天线那里  - 啥?

337
00:23:33.082 --> 00:23:35.676
保证你会帮我找到她 否则我就把你丢下了
Promise you'll help me find her or I'm leaving your Boov butt.

345

我怎么会输错?
How did that happen?


346
00:24:43.443 --> 00:24:46.117
把你的爪子移开!
Keep your Boov paws off my car!


347
00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:48.786
哦!
Whoa!


348
00:24:50.868 --> 00:24:52.541
你的车子被侵扰了
Your vehicle is infested.


349
00:24:53.579 --> 00:24:55.627

他叫小猪 不要碰他

352
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.553
他会爆炸吗?

353
00:25:01.712 --> 00:25:03.714
不会! 他只是在咕噜叫呢

你怎么会有这东西

什么? 不!

357

你养宠物是为了好玩 而且他能陪着你

是啊 不过 小猪比你好
Yeah, well, Pig is better.


360
00:25:20.939 --> 00:25:24.489
如果猫是"猪" 那你叫什么?
If cat is "Pig," what is your name?


361
00:25:36.538 --> 00:25:39.337
我叫小费·图奇 但我的朋友都叫我小钱
Gratuity Tucci. But my friends call me "Tip."


362
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.344

363
00:25:42.502 --> 00:25:45.506
但我们是朋友啊 人类和波星人
But we are friends. All humans and Boov.


364
00:25:45.672 --> 00:25:47.174
船长斯麦克说的
Captain Smek has decided.


365
00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:48.433
船长斯麦克是个白痴
Captain Smek is an idiot.


366
00:25:49.176 --> 00:25:50.348
不对!
Untrue!


367
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.390
船长斯麦克太天才了 而且特别会逃跑
Captain Smek is genius and best at running away.


368
00:25:55.182 --> 00:25:58.186
你听过嘘嘘的传说吗?
Have you not heard the legend of the Shusher?


369
00:25:59.102 --> 00:26:02.606
很久以前 我们的敌人 瓜星人...
Long ago, our enemy, the Gorg...


370
00:26:02.773 --> 00:26:05.447
邀请波星人进行和谈

371
00:26:11.698 --> 00:26:14.668
但是斯麦克很聪明地逃跑了
But Smek wisely fled in terror.


372
00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:17.670
而且他还带上了一块战利品: 嘘嘘
And he took a great trophy: the Shusher.


373
00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:19.046
跑啊!
Run away!


374
00:26:21.083 --> 00:26:23.006
为什么要叫"嘘嘘"?
Why is it called the "Shusher"?


375
00:26:23.794 --> 00:26:24.794
嘘!
Shush!


376
00:26:25.796 --> 00:26:27.013
算了
Whatever.


377
00:27:06.795 --> 00:27:08.012
真的假的?
Seriously?


378
00:27:08.171 --> 00:27:09.891
你们把自由女神像毁了?
You guys had to ruin the Statue Of Liberty?


379
00:27:10.048 --> 00:27:11.048
"斯麦克男神像"
"Statue of Smek."


380
00:27:11.174 --> 00:27:13.017
你们会付出代价的
You will not get away with this.


381
00:27:13.427 --> 00:27:14.427
波星人巡警!
Boov Patrol!


382
00:27:14.678 --> 00:27:15.725
他们在找你!
They are looking for you!


383
00:27:15.887 --> 00:27:16.887

384
00:27:32.237 --> 00:27:33.237
哦 不!
Oh, no!


385
00:27:34.906 --> 00:27:35.998
那是什么?
What's that?


386
00:27:40.037 --> 00:27:41.037
嘿!

387
00:27:41.038 --> 00:27:43.507
不要让司机分心!

388

啊哈 巴塔柠檬味

389
00:27:56.053 --> 00:27:57.475
"巴塔柠檬"
"Busta Lime."


390
00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:03.731
啊哦!

391
00:28:03.894 --> 00:28:04.941
啊哦!
Owpain.


392
00:28:20.702 --> 00:28:21.828
好吧 撒个尿
Okay. Pee break.


393
00:28:21.995 --> 00:28:23.372
我也要去撒个尿
I, too, has to break pee.


394
00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:25.131
你们把它叫做"小号"
Or, as you calls it, the "number one."


395
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.292
- 我们还有"大号"  - 好吧
- We also has the "number two."  - Okay.


396
00:28:27.459 --> 00:28:29.336
- 还有"超大号"  - 好了!
- And the "number three."  - Okay!


397
00:28:29.503 --> 00:28:31.551
幸好我不需要去超大号
It is a good thing I doos not have to go the number three.


398
00:28:31.713 --> 00:28:33.340
否则这对你可不安全
It would not be safe for you.


399
00:28:34.257 --> 00:28:35.884
我们一年只有一次超大号
We only doos it once a year.


400
00:28:36.051 --> 00:28:37.428
我觉得这称不上放假...
I would not call it a holiday...


401
00:28:37.594 --> 00:28:40.063
- 但这一天的确得在家休息  - 够了!
- but you doos need to take the day off.  - That's enough!


402
00:28:42.182 --> 00:28:45.152
你不能进来 这是女卫生间
You can't come in here. This is the girls' room.


403
00:28:54.903 --> 00:28:56.576
不要吃蓝色的薄荷!
Do not eat the blue mints!


404
00:28:58.949 --> 00:29:01.919
谢天谢地 还有一大盆柠檬汁
Thankfully, there is a large bowl of lemonade.


405

不要喝那个柠檬汁!
Do not drink the lemonade!


406
00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:10.419
马上就出来
Be out in a second.


407

413
00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:34.034
不要动 你被逮捕了!
Hold still for arresting!


414
00:29:34.192 --> 00:29:35.694
我最好的朋友凯尔!
Best friend Kyle!


415
00:29:35.861 --> 00:29:37.204
我才不是你的朋友呢!
I am not your friend!


416
00:29:37.362 --> 00:29:39.911
不过如果我搞到你的密码我就是英雄波星人了
But I will be a hero Boov for getting your password.


417
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:44.995
是的! 你来救我了!
Yes! You has in nick-time saved us!


418
00:29:47.497 --> 00:29:49.170
你这表情是什么意思?
What is the purpose of your face?


419
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.626
啊哦
Owpain.


420
00:29:50.792 --> 00:29:52.214
你想抛下我逃跑?
You were gonna ditch me?


421
00:29:52.377 --> 00:29:53.377
- 不!  - 撒谎!
- No!  - Liar!


422
00:29:53.503 --> 00:29:54.880
我从来不撒谎!
I never lie!


423
00:29:55.046 --> 00:29:56.046
你撒谎!
Yes, you do!


424
00:29:56.465 --> 00:29:57.512
你知道我怎么知道的吗?
And you know how I know?


425
00:29:57.674 --> 00:30:01.053
因为每次你撒谎 你都会变绿!
Because every time you lie, you turn green!


426
00:30:01.219 --> 00:30:02.721
才不会呢 我...
I doos not. I...


427
00:30:03.388 --> 00:30:04.388
卧槽
Poomp.


428
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.572
把门打开 你个长得像青蛙的会撒谎的东西!
Open the door, you lying, frog-faced squishy toy!


429
00:30:12.189 --> 00:30:13.315
停! 我需要你的...
Stop! I need your...


430
00:30:15.734 --> 00:30:17.327
你保证要帮我找我妈的!
You promised to help me find my mom!


431
00:30:17.486 --> 00:30:18.988
那我就收回保证!
Then I un-promise!


432
00:30:19.154 --> 00:30:20.701
不能这样的!
That's not how it works!


433
00:30:21.198 --> 00:30:23.451
你必须帮我去巴黎
You have to help me get to Paris.


434
00:30:23.617 --> 00:30:25.460
我不要!
I will not!


435
00:30:27.496 --> 00:30:28.964
停! 我需要你的...
Stop! I need your...


436
00:30:34.127 --> 00:30:35.174
我一定要躲起来!
I must hide!


437
00:30:35.337 --> 00:30:38.307
我在和你说英语 你怎么听不懂呢?
I am speaking the English at you. Whyfor do you not understands me?


438
00:30:38.465 --> 00:30:41.594
我听得懂 但我不关心
I "understands." I just don't care.


439
00:30:42.344 --> 00:30:43.470
- 不要动!  - 小心!
- Freezing!  - Look out!


440
00:30:52.062 --> 00:30:53.062
卧槽!
Come on!


441
00:30:55.273 --> 00:30:58.868
停! 我要你的密码
Stop! I need your password.


442
00:31:02.113 --> 00:31:02.784
不要!
No!


443
00:31:02.948 --> 00:31:03.948
快走!
Go!


444
00:31:22.342 --> 00:31:24.845
我只想要他的密码
All I wanted was his password.


445
00:31:29.516 --> 00:31:32.395
这样的友情可长久不了
This is not a sustainable friendship model.


446
00:31:58.044 --> 00:31:59.387
那么...
So...


447
00:31:59.546 --> 00:32:04.347
我想我们到现在应该已经抓到逃犯了
I assume by now we have apprehended the fugitive.


448
00:32:04.676 --> 00:32:06.178
有人吗?
Anybody?


449
00:32:06.344 --> 00:32:08.267
你 紫色的那个
You. The purple one.


450
00:32:10.974 --> 00:32:13.014
不是这个紫色的 另一个紫色的 那个紫色的
Not that purple. The other purple. The other purple.


451
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:15.561
就是他
That one.


452
00:32:15.562 --> 00:32:16.562
对了 就是你!
Yes, you!


453
00:32:16.938 --> 00:32:18.531
那他在哪?
So, where is he?


454
00:32:18.898 --> 00:32:20.195
我们不知道 长官
We do not know, sir.


455
00:32:20.358 --> 00:32:22.702
什么? 这是个大灾难!
What? This is number one disaster!


456
00:32:22.861 --> 00:32:25.205
他的信息绝对不能到达瓜星
His message must not reach the Gorg.


457
00:32:25.363 --> 00:32:28.913
我找这个行星可难了 我不要抛弃它!
This planet was hard to find, and I will not abandon it!


458
00:32:29.075 --> 00:32:32.329
谁把我的解压毯子拿来
Someone fetch me my stress blankie.


459
00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:38.926
太棒了
So soothing.


460
00:32:42.213 --> 00:32:43.931
啊哈! 凯尔长官!
Aha! Officer Kyle!


461
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.060
这个波星人最称职了
Now here is a Boov who knows how to do his job.


462
00:32:47.218 --> 00:32:49.437
告诉我 你找到那个通缉犯了?
Tell me, you have found the fugitive?


463
00:32:49.596 --> 00:32:50.768
是的
Yes.


464
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.807
令人惊叹!
Joyful exclamation!


465
00:32:55.352 --> 00:32:56.945
他在哪儿?
And where is he?


466
00:32:58.438 --> 00:33:00.486
出了一点小问题
There is a tiny problem.


467
00:33:03.318 --> 00:33:06.492
"小问题" 小问题而已 管它呢?
"Tiny." As long as it's tiny, who cares?


468
00:33:07.489 --> 00:33:09.787
呃 在我拿到密码之前...
Well, before I got the password...


469
00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:12.582
我把他干掉了
I erased him.


470
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:19.585
来聚会吧 来聚会吧 来聚会吧
Come party. Come party. Come party.


471
00:33:23.838 --> 00:33:25.465
- 快停下!  - 对不起啊
- Quit it!  - Sorry.


472
00:33:25.632 --> 00:33:27.760
巴黎对我们俩而言都很危险
Look, Paris is danger for both of us.


473
00:33:27.926 --> 00:33:29.974
那里全都是波星人
It crawls with Boov.


474
00:33:30.136 --> 00:33:33.185
我们到那儿以后你有什么计划?
Doos you have a plan for once we are get there?


475
00:33:33.348 --> 00:33:36.443
没有 但是我有希望
Not really. But I have hope.


476
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:38.775
你数学真差
You are bad at math.


477
00:33:38.937 --> 00:33:39.688
你说什么?
Excuse me?


478
00:33:39.854 --> 00:33:41.606
我可是几何学拿了"A"的人
I got an "A" in geometry.


479
00:33:41.773 --> 00:33:43.116
我只是说...
I am only saying...


480
00:33:43.274 --> 00:33:45.777
波星人更懂计算
Boov are superior in this way.


481
00:33:46.111 --> 00:33:50.116
如果成功的概率低于百分之50...
If probability for success falls below 50%...


482
00:33:51.783 --> 00:33:54.332
波星人就会放弃 但你不会
Boov give up. You do not.


483
00:33:54.494 --> 00:33:55.494
就是这样!
Exactly!


484
00:33:56.371 --> 00:33:57.839
够了 别再撕了!
Enough with the ripping!


485
00:33:57.997 --> 00:33:59.294
好的 好的
Okay, Okay.


486
00:33:59.457 --> 00:34:01.334
告诉你 我们来点音乐吧
Tell you what. Let's have some tuneage.


487
00:34:08.967 --> 00:34:10.389
这是什么?
What is that?


488
00:34:10.552 --> 00:34:12.304
波星人的歌曲
Boov song.


489
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:14.472
这个叫做 "一动不动要听话"
It is called "Motionless and Obedient."


490
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:15.639
非常火呢
Very big hit.


491
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.984
不不行! 我车里不行
No, no, no! Not in my car.


492
00:34:18.143 --> 00:34:19.520
司机才有权决定放什么
Driver gets to pick.


493
00:34:23.356 --> 00:34:26.155
这根本不算音乐 不过是噪音
This is not even music. This is just noise.


494
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:38.167
这是下意识的生理反应
Involuntary physical response.


495
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:41.754
你骗我听这个有毒的声波武器
You have tricked me into listening to a debilitating sonic weapon.


496
00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:44.886
如果你不想让人类恨你的话...
If you want humans to not hate you...


497
00:34:45.044 --> 00:34:47.422
你可以从喜欢我们的东西开始
you could start by liking some of our stuff.


498
00:34:52.427 --> 00:34:55.055
奇怪 我身体怎么了?
Confusion. What is happening to my body?


499
00:34:55.221 --> 00:34:56.598
这个叫跳舞
It's called dancing!


500
00:34:56.765 --> 00:34:58.688
波星人从来不跳舞
Boov do not dancing!


501
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.353
我看出来了 但你已经跳起来了!
I can tell. But you're getting the hang of it!


502
00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:03.362
这样跳下去多久会死?
How long before this kills me?


503
00:35:03.521 --> 00:35:06.115
我控制不了我的四肢了!
I am not in control of my own extremities!


504
00:35:06.274 --> 00:35:08.402
就是这样 动起来!
That's it. Work it!


505
00:35:08.568 --> 00:35:09.865
我不想这么动!
I do not want it to work!


506
00:35:10.028 --> 00:35:11.028
你知道吗?
You know what?


507
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:13.369
瞧你多有天份啊
"Boov" rhymes with "groove."


508
00:35:13.531 --> 00:35:15.454
跳起来吧 波星人
Shake your Boov thang.


509
00:35:16.034 --> 00:35:18.207
这么晃好丢人啊!
It is shaking in a most undignified way!


510
00:35:19.037 --> 00:35:22.541
噢 不! 我的手就像不受控制一样挥舞起来了!
Oh, no! My hands are in the air like I just do not care!


511
00:35:22.874 --> 00:35:24.797
这可不是一个波星人应该做的!
This is not how a Boov behaves!


512
00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:26.586
我简直太丢人了!
I am overheated with shame!


513
00:35:26.753 --> 00:35:28.551
- 我必须冷静下来!  - 等等
- I must cool my core!  - Wait!


514
00:35:28.713 --> 00:35:31.136
- 你在干什么?  - 我会回来的!
- What are you doing?  - I will returning!


515
00:35:31.883 --> 00:35:33.100
我们正在玩儿呢!
We were having fun!


516
00:35:33.885 --> 00:35:34.886
噢!
Oh!


517
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.601
哦?
Oh?


518
00:35:52.237 --> 00:35:53.910
够了 妈妈 这不过是雪而已!
Come on, Mom. It's just snow!


519
00:35:54.072 --> 00:35:55.995
我连什么是雪都不知道
I don't know anything about snow.


520
00:35:57.075 --> 00:35:58.327
我们的第一场雪!
Our first snow!


521
00:36:01.579 --> 00:36:02.751
你还好吗?
Are you okay?


522
00:36:02.914 --> 00:36:04.086
我要把这个发给...
I'm sending this to...


523
00:36:05.291 --> 00:36:07.134
我的温度又降回正常了
My temperature is back to happiness.


524
00:36:07.293 --> 00:36:10.593
为了表示我对你没有任何不满...
And to show I do not hold against you any grudge-ment...


525
00:36:10.755 --> 00:36:13.349
我给你带了美味的零食
I have brought you delicious snacking.


526
00:36:13.508 --> 00:36:15.602
伐嗒! 耐嚼的塑料环!
Fa-da! Chewy plastic rings!


527
00:36:18.263 --> 00:36:20.812
我真不喜欢你们人类这种表示感激的方式
I really do not enjoy your human gratitude customs.


528
00:36:20.974 --> 00:36:22.100
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?


529
00:36:22.267 --> 00:36:23.439
你再也别回来了!
You were gone forever!


530
00:36:23.601 --> 00:36:25.274
这么说不精确 "永远"是指...
That is not accurate. "Forever" is...


531
00:36:25.436 --> 00:36:27.655
我以为你死了! 或者受伤了!
I thought you were dead! Or hurt!


532
00:36:27.814 --> 00:36:29.782
或者... 我也不知道!
Or... I don't know!


533
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:32.694
但是你不能就这么抛下别人!
But you cannot just leave someone alone like that!


534
00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:34.829
你得穿我的鞋!
Put yourself in my shoes!


535
00:36:34.988 --> 00:36:36.706
我怎么能穿你的鞋?
How could I wears your shoes?


536
00:36:36.865 --> 00:36:38.162
我的脚太小了
My pods are too small.


537
00:36:38.324 --> 00:36:39.541
这是个比喻!
It's an expression!


538
00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:42.955
意思是设身处地为别人考虑
It means try to feel how someone else feels.


539
00:36:43.121 --> 00:36:47.046
我只是个孩子 我不能老是独自一个人呆着
I'm just a kid. I'm not supposed to be by myself all the time.


540
00:36:47.208 --> 00:36:50.963
这是在危害儿童 我告诉你 这是犯罪
This is child endangerment. Which is a crime, by the way.


541
00:36:51.129 --> 00:36:53.632
但是我找到你的时候 你就已经独自一人了...
But when I founded you, you were already alone...


542
00:36:53.798 --> 00:36:55.550
所以我觉得对你而言 这很正常
so I thinks it is normal for you.


543
00:36:55.717 --> 00:36:58.220
我们小的时候 是被养在保温箱里的
When Boov are young, we are kept in the warming oven.


544
00:37:04.642 --> 00:37:06.986
对人类来说这正常吗?
Is this normal for humanspersons?


545
00:37:07.145 --> 00:37:12.151
一般来说 16岁以下我们不独自穿越大西洋
Usually, we don't cross the Atlantic by ourselves until we're 16.


546
00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:14.490
不 这些全都不正常!
No, none of this is normal!


547
00:37:14.652 --> 00:37:17.531
你还不明白吗? 你把一切都毁了!
Don't you get it? You ruined everything!


548
00:37:17.697 --> 00:37:21.918
我好不容易在这儿得到了快乐... 在我生活的地方
I was finally happy here... There, where I lived.


549
00:37:22.076 --> 00:37:23.419
和我妈妈一起
With my mom.


550
00:37:23.828 --> 00:37:26.206
你知道我适应那儿有多不容易吗?
Do you know how hard it was for me to fit in?


551
00:37:26.372 --> 00:37:27.840
花了多长时间?
How long that took?


552
00:37:27.999 --> 00:37:30.172
7年级的女孩都很残忍!

553
00:37:30.335 --> 00:37:32.508
是的 我看到了! 但我不明白!
Yes, I sees that! I did not realize!


554
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.015
我们会继续去找我妈妈
We will resume the finding of Mimom.


555
00:37:36.174 --> 00:37:37.892
别说了!
Stop saying that!


556
00:37:38.051 --> 00:37:40.429
她只是"我"妈妈
She's just "my" mom.


557
00:37:40.595 --> 00:37:42.689
不是你的 我的
Not yours. Mine.


558
00:37:42.847 --> 00:37:45.270
你怎么连这个都不懂?
How do you not understand this?


559
00:37:45.433 --> 00:37:48.937
如果可怕的外星人抓走了你妈妈 你会是什么感觉?
How would you feel if some horrible aliens took your mother from you?


560
00:37:50.188 --> 00:37:52.031
那不可能的
That could not to happen.


561
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.192
波星人没有我妈妈
Boov are not having mimoms.


562
00:37:55.777 --> 00:37:58.075
波星人没有家吗
Boov don't have families.


563
00:37:59.364 --> 00:38:02.208
怪不得你们抢别人的东西 还一点都不放在心上
No wonder you take things and don't care about anybody else.


564
00:38:07.205 --> 00:38:10.049
所以 你的我妈妈...
So, your mimom...


565
00:38:10.208 --> 00:38:13.052
是一个对你很重要的人
is a very important humansperson to you.


566
00:38:13.211 --> 00:38:15.885
比其他人都重要
More important than others.


567
00:38:16.047 --> 00:38:20.097
不在她身边 你会很难过
To not belong with her causes you being sad.


568
00:38:23.888 --> 00:38:27.392
但是刚才 你踢我还对我大吼大叫
But recent moments ago, you are kicking on me and yelling.


569
00:38:27.558 --> 00:38:31.563
这个更像是难过又愤怒
Which is seeming more to be mad than sad.


570
00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:35.780
呃 有时两个都有
Well, sometimes it's both.


571
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:40.367
所以 你是难过加愤怒
So, you are sad-mad.


572
00:38:52.917 --> 00:38:56.296
人类比手册上写的复杂多了
Humans are more complicated than it said in the pamphlet.


573
00:39:03.636 --> 00:39:05.479
我用最快的速度把这里清空了
I vacuumed here as fast as I could.


574
00:39:06.597 --> 00:39:09.271
你有什么办法能破解那个傻瓜波星人的密码?
Whatfor is your plan for figuring out the dumb Boov's password?


575
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.772
我没办法!
I got nothing!


576
00:39:11.936 --> 00:39:14.064
拜托 快点! 我需要主意!
Please, come on! I need ideas!


577
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.232
你! 那个紫的
You! The purple one.


578
00:39:19.152 --> 00:39:20.779
噢 拜托!
Oh, come on!


579
00:39:21.946 --> 00:39:22.947
所以?
So?


580
00:39:23.114 --> 00:39:28.086
我们可以随便输些数字和字母?
We could type in random numbers and letters?


581
00:39:29.162 --> 00:39:30.288
我喜欢这个主意!
I like it!


582
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:34.130
给这些大脑充电 开始工作
Get those big brains plugged in and working.


583
00:39:34.292 --> 00:39:35.464
开动!
Away!


584
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:38.839
你们知道如果瓜星人抓住我们 他们会干什么
You know what the Gorg will do if they find us.


585
00:39:39.005 --> 00:39:40.097
咯 咯 咯(咬牙的声音)
Chomp, chomp, chomp.


586
00:39:44.469 --> 00:39:46.767
这就是为什么我们一直东躲西藏
And that is why we keep running away.


587
00:39:47.305 --> 00:39:48.305
哇喔
Whoa.


588
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:50.354
为什么瓜星人这么恨你们?
Why do these Gorg hate you so much?


589
00:39:50.516 --> 00:39:51.768
因为他们是瓜星人
Because they are Gorg.


590
00:39:51.934 --> 00:39:54.278
我们把瓜星人称为"掠夺者"...
We calls Gorg the "takers"...


591
00:39:54.437 --> 00:39:57.657
因为如果你有什么东西 他们就会夺走
because if you has something, they takes it.


592
00:39:57.815 --> 00:39:59.613
比如 你有一个三明治
Like, if you has a sandwich.


593
00:39:59.776 --> 00:40:00.948
或者一个星球
Or a planet.


594
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.953
噢 噢 我明白的
No, no. I get it.


595
00:40:03.112 --> 00:40:04.989
不过他们不会到这个星球来的 对吧?
But they're not coming to this planet, right?


596
00:40:05.156 --> 00:40:06.703
噢 不会的 别担心
Oh, no, no. Not to worry.


597
00:40:06.866 --> 00:40:10.166
大头波星人会解决我的错误的
The Big Brain Boov will to fix my mistake.


598
00:40:10.328 --> 00:40:12.171
但是我仍然会被惩罚
But I will still be very punished.


599
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:13.957
我们有个规矩
We has a rule.


600
00:40:14.123 --> 00:40:16.546
犯九次错 你就出局了
Nine mistakes and you are out.


601
00:40:16.709 --> 00:40:18.507
你犯了多少次错了?
How many mistakes do you have?


602
00:40:19.212 --> 00:40:20.464
62次

603
00:40:24.842 --> 00:40:28.312
当我有压力的时候 我妈妈就会给我讲笑话
When I'm stressed out, my mom tells me jokes.


604
00:40:28.805 --> 00:40:31.183
波星人从来不讲笑话
Boov do not do telling jokes.


605
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:33.147
这不难 我来教你
It's not that hard. I'll teach you.


606
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:34.309
咚 咚
Knock, knock.


607
00:40:35.478 --> 00:40:37.526
你要说 "外面是谁?"
You would say, "Who's there?"


608
00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:41.029
你在外面啊
You are there.


609
00:40:41.192 --> 00:40:42.694
不 你就这么问我
No, just ask me.


610
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.860
谁在外面?
Who is there?


611
00:40:43.861 --> 00:40:46.489
然后我说 "插嘴牛"
Now I say, "The interrupting cow."


612
00:40:46.656 --> 00:40:49.535
然后你说 "插嘴牛是谁啊?"
Now you say, "The interrupting cow, who?"


613
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.701
我们开始玩吧
Let's just do it.


614
00:40:50.868 --> 00:40:53.166
- 咚 咚  - 谁在外面?
- Knock, knock.  - Who is there?


615
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:55.081
插嘴牛
The interrupting cow.


616
00:40:55.248 --> 00:40:57.671
- 插嘴牛...  - 哞!
- The interrupting cow...  - Moo!


617
00:40:57.834 --> 00:40:59.882
我还没有说完呢
You did not let me finish my response.


618
00:41:00.044 --> 00:41:03.048
- 我应该说"插嘴..."  - 哞!
- I was to say, "The interrupting co..."  - Moo!


619
00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:04.761
你又来了一遍
You did it again.


620
00:41:07.051 --> 00:41:08.724
这就是笑话
That is the joke.


621
00:41:08.886 --> 00:41:11.730
那个牛是一个插嘴牛...
The cow is to being an interrupting cow...


622
00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:13.891
所以才打断我说话!
and therefore interrupts me!


623
00:41:14.058 --> 00:41:16.356
- 我知道 所以才好玩  - 哞!
- I know . That's why it's funny.  - Moo!


624
00:41:16.519 --> 00:41:18.112
- 让我说...  - 哞!
- Let me fi...  - Moo!


625
00:41:18.271 --> 00:41:19.991
- 够了  - 我是插嘴牛
- That's enough.  - I'm the interrupting cow.


626
00:41:20.022 --> 00:41:21.569
- 别再说了!  - 哞!
- Knock it off!  - Moo!


627
00:41:21.732 --> 00:41:23.780
- 别逼我再拿胶带!  - 哞!
- Don't make me get out more tape!  - Moo!


628
00:41:32.243 --> 00:41:34.621
这么多波星人!
So many Boovs!


629
00:41:35.371 --> 00:41:36.748
我就说这简直傻透了
I said this was dumbness.


630
00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:39.542
我就说我完蛋了 但是你听了吗? 没有!
I said I am doomed. But doos you listen? No!


631
00:41:39.709 --> 00:41:40.709
噢 够了!
Oh, that's enough!


632
00:41:40.751 --> 00:41:42.594
你快把我逼疯了!
You are driving me to the crazy!


633
00:41:42.753 --> 00:41:45.973
逃跑永远都不嫌晚 这是波星人的名言
It is never too late to run away. That is the Boov motto.


634
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:48.935
是的 但是我们不逃跑 我有个计划
Yes, but we're not doing that. I have a plan.


635
00:41:49.093 --> 00:41:52.097
你的计划是逃跑吗? 因为除了这个 都傻透了!
Is your plan to run away? Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!


636
00:41:52.263 --> 00:41:54.061
我们只要溜进去...
All we have to do is sneak into the city...


637
00:41:54.223 --> 00:41:57.067
去那个大天线上 用它来找到我妈妈...
get into the Great Antenna, use it to find my mom...


638
00:41:57.226 --> 00:41:59.274
然后再溜出来就行了 看到了吗?
and then sneak out again. See?


639
00:41:59.437 --> 00:42:02.486
这行不通 他们全都认识我
But it still will not work because my face is known.


640
00:42:02.648 --> 00:42:07.119
只要我被任何一个波星人看到 我百分之百会被逮捕的
If I am seen by any Boov, I am 100% popular for being arrested.


641
00:42:08.779 --> 00:42:10.452
要是我能解决这个问题呢?
What if I could fix that?


642
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:26.677
别动
Hold still.


643
00:42:28.257 --> 00:42:30.806
首先 来一个可爱的小雀斑
First, a little beauty mark.


644
00:42:31.636 --> 00:42:33.138
让我看看
Letting me see.


645
00:42:33.304 --> 00:42:35.544
- 没完呢 把镜子给我  - 给我看 给我看!
- Not yet. Give me that mirror.  - Give to me, give to me!


646
00:42:38.142 --> 00:42:41.146
看上去完全就是一个陌生人!
It is like looking at a completed stranger!


647
00:42:41.312 --> 00:42:43.280
不 还没结束呢 这还没...
No, I'm not done. It's not even...


648
00:42:43.439 --> 00:42:46.488
你简直是个不可思议的化妆师!
You are a worker of miraculous transformation!


649
00:42:46.651 --> 00:42:48.119
这个波星人是谁?
Who is this Boov?


650
00:42:48.277 --> 00:42:49.699
我不知道!
I do not know!


651
00:42:50.821 --> 00:42:52.038
噢 好吧
All right, Oh.


652
00:42:54.492 --> 00:42:55.493
哎呦
Owpain.


653
00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:16.681
高速电梯启动中
Express elevator departing.


654
00:43:30.361 --> 00:43:31.361
哇喔!
Whoa!


655
00:43:31.529 --> 00:43:33.531
简直令人大开眼界
This is uber freaky.


656
00:43:33.698 --> 00:43:36.201
这些都是你们最聪明的波星人吗?
These are the smartest Boov you have?


657
00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:38.911
你必须非常安静
You must be very quiet.


658
00:43:39.078 --> 00:43:40.798
你不能分散他们的注意力...
You do not want to break their concentra...


659
00:43:43.666 --> 00:43:44.758
来聚会吧 来聚会吧
Come party. Come party.


660
00:43:46.544 --> 00:43:47.591
噢! 那是什么?
Oh! What is it?


661
00:43:47.753 --> 00:43:50.757
我以为大头波星人已经终止了发送邀请信息
I thought the Big Brain Boovs would have stopped my invitation by now.


662
00:43:50.923 --> 00:43:52.843
可是他们竟然还没有找到我的密码
But they have still not figured out my password.


663
00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:54.443
- 这怎么可能呢?  - 等一下
- How is this possible?  - Wait a minute.


664
00:43:54.593 --> 00:43:57.517
这东西意思是说 那些叫瓜星人的怪物会到地球来?
Does this mean those horrible monster Gorg thingies will come to Earth'?


665
00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.102
对的 来斯麦克星!
To Smekland, yes!


666
00:43:59.265 --> 00:44:00.517
然后会怎么样呢?
And what happens then?


667
00:44:03.019 --> 00:44:05.021
我们就再也找不到我妈妈了!
There will be no finding of Mimom!


668
00:44:05.938 --> 00:44:07.406
那你必须解决这个问题!
Then you've gotta fix this!


669
00:44:07.565 --> 00:44:08.862
对
Yes.


670
00:44:10.234 --> 00:44:11.360
快点!
Hurry!


671
00:44:11.527 --> 00:44:13.279
顺便问一下 你的头骨有弹性吗?
By to the way, is your skull flexible?


672
00:44:13.446 --> 00:44:14.242
- 什么?  - 别管了
- What?  - Never mind.


673
00:44:14.405 --> 00:44:15.845
应该没问题的 别动
It will be probably okay. Hold still.


674
00:44:28.961 --> 00:44:30.133
哇喔!
Wow!


675
00:44:34.133 --> 00:44:35.760
还有30秒就完蛋了

676
00:44:35.926 --> 00:44:37.803
我得输入我的密码 是...
I shall input my password. It is...


677
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:42.771
"我的名字叫小欧 斯麦克船长非常伟大 谁不这么想谁就是傻子 1"
"My name is Oh and Captain Smek is great and anyone who does not think that is a poomp 1."


678
00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:44.435
我很奇怪怎么会没人想的出来
I wonder why no one guessed that.


679
00:44:44.602 --> 00:44:45.728
我不知道
I do not know.


680
00:44:47.438 --> 00:44:48.985
- 不起作用?  - 不可能!
- It didn't work?  - Impossible!


681
00:44:49.148 --> 00:44:50.148
密码就是这个!
That is password!


682
00:44:50.232 --> 00:44:52.405
这个就是... 噢 不! 大写锁定
That is... Oh, no! Caps Lock.


683
00:44:59.784 --> 00:45:00.824
快点 快点 快点!
Come on, come on, come on!


684
00:45:00.826 --> 00:45:03.124
来聚会吧 来聚会吧 来聚会吧

成功了!

690
00:45:35.986 --> 00:45:37.283
好悬呐
That was closeness.


691
00:45:37.446 --> 00:45:38.446
站起来
On your feet.


692
00:45:38.489 --> 00:45:40.332
你还是得找到我妈妈
You still have to find my mom.


693

695
00:45:45.496 --> 00:45:47.464
"露西·图奇"
"Lucy Tucci."


696
00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:51.051
澳大利亚?
Australia?


697
00:45:54.505 --> 00:45:56.348
寻找我妈妈
Observe Mimom.


698
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.347
这可不好笑
That's not funny.


699
00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.887
这不是你的我妈妈?
This is not your mimom?


700
00:46:01.053 --> 00:46:02.053
你逗我呢?
Are you kidding?


701
00:46:02.638 --> 00:46:04.515
不是她!
That's not her!


702
00:46:04.974 --> 00:46:06.066
你确定?
Sure?


703
00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:08.402
我知道 好吗?
I know, I know. Okay?


704
00:46:08.561 --> 00:46:10.081
你已经说了两个星期了

705

706

707
00:46:15.067 --> 00:46:16.193
妈妈

708
00:46:17.361 --> 00:46:18.988
告诉我她在哪
So tell me where she is.


709
00:46:19.155 --> 00:46:21.078
或者找个知道她在哪的波星人
Or find me a Boov who can.


710
00:46:23.492 --> 00:46:24.493
求你了

711
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:28.756
小费·图奇 你看起来简直就是小号的我妈妈
Gratuity Tucci looks just like tiny Mimom.


712
00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:32.548
小费·图奇? 你...
Gratuity Tucci? Whyfor...


713
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:35.680
谢谢! 谢谢 谢谢 谢谢 谢谢!
Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!


714
00:46:41.552 --> 00:46:44.226
真不敢相信! 我妈妈居然在澳大利亚!
I can't believe it! My mom's in Australia!


715
00:46:44.388 --> 00:46:46.766
而且我取消掉了我的邀请!
And I has cancelled my e-vite!


716
00:46:46.932 --> 00:46:48.934
我终于不用到处躲了
I can finally come out of the hiding.


717
00:46:49.101 --> 00:46:50.102
对!
Yes!


718
00:47:01.071 --> 00:47:03.290
瞧瞧你
Well, well, well.


719
00:47:05.618 --> 00:47:06.710
人呢?
Hello?


720
00:47:07.536 --> 00:47:08.537
拿着我的皇冠
Hold my crown.


721
00:47:08.704 --> 00:47:10.706
小心点 这可是唯一一个
And be very careful. It's the only one.


722
00:47:11.415 --> 00:47:13.042
瞧瞧你
Well, well, well.


723
00:47:13.876 --> 00:47:16.129
你真的以为你能逃出去?
Did you really think you could escape?


724
00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:19.640
逃? 没 没 没
Escape? No, no, no.


725
00:47:19.798 --> 00:47:21.141
你看 我才准备过来告诉你...
You see, I was just coming to tell you...


726
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.553
尽管你使用了复杂的伪装...
Despite your elaborate disguise...


727
00:47:24.094 --> 00:47:26.768
电脑依旧可以把你识别为
the computer recognized you as...


728
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:29.275
逃亡的波星人
the fugitive Boov!


729
00:47:33.479 --> 00:47:34.901
但是他现在是英雄波星人了!
But he's a hero Boov now!


730
00:47:35.064 --> 00:47:37.658
是啊! 我改正了我的错误!
Yes! I has fixed my mistake!


731
00:47:37.816 --> 00:47:40.444
是 但是在这之前你犯了错
Yes, but before that, you has made your mistake.


732
00:47:40.611 --> 00:47:42.830
并且以前还犯过很多错误
And many mistakes before that.


733
00:47:42.988 --> 00:47:46.288
- 等等 我没有...  - 好多好多好多
- Wait, I have not...  - Many, many, many, many...


734
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.450
其实...
Actually...


735
00:47:47.451 --> 00:47:49.795
好多错误
Many mistakes before that.


736
00:47:50.496 --> 00:47:52.464
- 所以我还是要消灭你  - 为什么?
- So, I still has to erase you.  - Why?


737
00:47:52.623 --> 00:47:54.823
你不能保证你以后不会再犯错误了
You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.


738
00:47:54.959 --> 00:47:57.803
- 但是我不会了  - 但你可能
- But I would not.  - But you might.


739
00:47:57.962 --> 00:47:58.758
但是我不会了
But I would not.


740
00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:00.343
我们可以来回说 再来一次!
We could go round and round. Let's do it again!


741
00:48:00.506 --> 00:48:01.632
- 但是我不会了  - 但你可能
- But I would not.  - But you might.


742
00:48:01.799 --> 00:48:03.597
- 但是我不会了  - 我喜欢这个!
- But I would not.  - I love this!


743
00:48:05.135 --> 00:48:07.763
- 但是我不会了!  - 好无聊
- But I would not!  - Bored now.


744
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:08.977
- 但是我不...  - 闭嘴!
- But I would...  - Shush!


745
00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:10.139
消灭他!
Erase him!


746
00:48:12.601 --> 00:48:14.820
放下你们的气泡枪!
Drop the bubble guns!


747
00:48:14.979 --> 00:48:17.323
不然我就弄坏这个...
Or I will mess with this...


748
00:48:17.773 --> 00:48:19.616
重力仪
gravity thingy.


749
00:48:19.775 --> 00:48:21.027
她吹牛
She is bluffing.


750
00:48:21.318 --> 00:48:24.117
她根本碰不到重力仪
She could not possibly reach the gravity thingy.


751
00:48:25.155 --> 00:48:27.374
我诅咒你这该死的身高!
Curse you and your tippy-toe tallness!


752
00:48:28.325 --> 00:48:29.326
但是没问题
But no problem.


753
00:48:29.493 --> 00:48:34.841
波星人的技术对于你这种思想简单的人类女孩来说太复杂了
Boov technology is far too complicated for simple humansgirl to figure out.


754
00:48:34.999 --> 00:48:36.342
你说什么?
Excuse me?


755
00:48:38.002 --> 00:48:41.006
这个人类女孩的几何是 "A"
This humansgirl got an "A" in geometry.


756
00:48:44.675 --> 00:48:47.474
她弄明白了! 快跑啊!
She figured it out! Run for my life!


757
00:48:49.138 --> 00:48:51.186
都闪开! 我是船长!
Out of my way! I am captain!


758
00:49:06.363 --> 00:49:07.364
抓住!
Grab on!


759
00:49:08.324 --> 00:49:09.576
不行! 我抓不住你!
Oh, no! I can't hold you!


760
00:49:10.326 --> 00:49:12.078
你太沉了!
You weigh, like, a thousand pounds!


761
00:49:13.203 --> 00:49:13.874
松手
Let go.


762
00:49:14.038 --> 00:49:15.881
- 什么?  - 相信我
- What?  - Trust me.


763
00:49:22.504 --> 00:49:24.552
不好意思 我有权利先逃跑
Sorry. It is my duty to run away first.


764
00:49:26.383 --> 00:49:27.054
嘭
Poomp.


765
00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:29.060
- 你等什么呢?  - 我不能碰它
- What are you waiting for?  - I cannot touch.


766
00:49:29.219 --> 00:49:30.721
如果我开的话它是不会飞的
It will not work if I drive it.


767
00:49:31.555 --> 00:49:33.023
好吧 我来开
Fine. I'll drive.


768
00:49:38.687 --> 00:49:39.687
好疼
Owpain.


769
00:49:43.734 --> 00:49:45.327
你驾驶技术太差了
You are terrible driver.


770
00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:12.513
加油啊
Come on.


771
00:50:13.555 --> 00:50:14.898
加油 加油
Come on. Come on.


772
00:50:15.724 --> 00:50:16.270
用餐愉快
Bon appétit.


773
00:50:16.392 --> 00:50:17.564
不 你才不会呢
Oh, no, you don't!


774
00:50:17.726 --> 00:50:19.228
我是不会付钱的
I am not paying for that.


775
00:50:37.579 --> 00:50:39.456
别这样啊 你这蠢马
Come on, you stupid horse!


776
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:48.932
呼 好险...
Whoo, that was cl...


777
00:50:59.476 --> 00:51:00.477
这次我抓到你了...
This time I got you...


778
00:51:00.644 --> 00:51:02.317
你跑不了了
and you cannot escape.


779
00:51:03.063 --> 00:51:04.155
检测到在逃波星人
Fugitive Boov detected.


780
00:51:04.314 --> 00:51:05.314
我错了
I was wrong.


781
00:51:10.487 --> 00:51:11.487
跳啊!
Jump!


782
00:51:11.613 --> 00:51:12.614
哦 不!
Oh, no!


783
00:51:24.835 --> 00:51:26.587
看! 我找到我们的车了
Look! I has found our car.


784
00:51:26.754 --> 00:51:27.755
小猪!
Pig!


785
00:51:37.097 --> 00:51:39.350
我不知道你为什么要拿那个
I do not know whyfor you brought that.


786
00:51:39.516 --> 00:51:41.189
我们车里已经有食物了
We already hads food in the car.


787
00:51:41.351 --> 00:51:43.353
这不是食物 这是艺术
It's not food, it's art.


788
00:51:44.438 --> 00:51:45.860
那它一定不好
Then it is bad.


789
00:51:46.023 --> 00:51:48.151
行星才不是那样的呢
Stars do not look like that.


790
00:51:48.317 --> 00:51:49.694
这和它们的长相没关系
It's not about how they look.


791
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.988
这和他们给你的感觉有关
It's about how they feel.


792
00:51:52.362 --> 00:51:53.955
他们很热
They feel hot.


793
00:51:55.115 --> 00:51:58.210
好吧 数学能手 我们多长时间可以到澳大利亚?
Okay, math whiz, how long till we get to Australia?


794
00:51:58.368 --> 00:52:00.541
17.9348个小时

795
00:52:01.038 --> 00:52:02.711
然后 小费·图奇...
And then, Gratuity Tucci...


796
00:52:02.873 --> 00:52:04.341
就会见到我妈妈
will see Mimom.


797
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.052
听到了吗 小猪?
You hear that, Pig?


798
00:52:08.212 --> 00:52:10.886
我都等不及告诉妈妈我来过巴黎了...
I can't wait to tell Mom I actually went to Paris...


799
00:52:11.048 --> 00:52:13.221
她一直都想来这里
which you know she always wanted to do.


800
00:52:13.383 --> 00:52:15.385
我们可以一起回来这里
Maybe we could both come back here.


801
00:52:15.552 --> 00:52:17.475
我们现在有会飞的车了
We do have a flying car now.


802
00:52:17.638 --> 00:52:20.232
法语的猫怎么说?
How do you say "cat" in French?


803
00:52:20.724 --> 00:52:22.522
我觉得应该是 "聊"
I think it's "chat."


804
00:52:32.694 --> 00:52:34.822
你这是什么表情?
What is the purpose of your face?


805
00:52:38.534 --> 00:52:40.377
我很困惑
I has confusion.


806
00:52:42.037 --> 00:52:44.586
我不想被消灭
I do not wish to be erased.


807
00:52:45.415 --> 00:52:47.918
但船长斯麦克可能是对的
But maybe Captain Smek is right.


808
00:52:48.418 --> 00:52:52.719
我很可能再犯低级错误
It is possible I will continue making hilarious mistakes.


809
00:52:53.257 --> 00:52:54.258
可能吧
Probably.


810
00:52:54.424 --> 00:52:56.426
这可不会让我开心
That is not making me feel better.


811
00:52:56.593 --> 00:52:58.266
人无完人
Nobody's perfect.


812
00:52:58.428 --> 00:53:02.774
我妈妈说犯错是人的本性
My mom says your mistakes are what make you human.


813
00:53:02.933 --> 00:53:05.231
可不是波星人的本性
That is not what makes you Boov.


814
00:53:08.397 --> 00:53:10.115
小费·图奇...
Gratuity Tucci...


815
00:53:10.274 --> 00:53:12.276
在我们来之前...
before we came...


816
00:53:12.442 --> 00:53:16.163
船长斯麦克告诉我们 人类需要我们的帮助
Captain Smek telled us that the humans needed us.


817
00:53:16.655 --> 00:53:19.499
人类就像是动物一样...
That the humans were just like the animals...


818
00:53:19.658 --> 00:53:21.956
我们可以让他们变得更好...
and that we could to make them better...


819
00:53:22.119 --> 00:53:23.871
教化他们
teach to them.


820
00:53:24.037 --> 00:53:29.043
我们被告知人类是简单落后的种族
We were told the humans were simple and backwards.


821
00:53:30.794 --> 00:53:33.092
这就是我们的看法
It is what we thought.


822
00:53:33.463 --> 00:53:34.635
但是 我现在觉得
But I am thinking now...


823
00:53:36.008 --> 00:53:38.477
我们的看法错了
that we were thinking wrong.


824
00:53:38.635 --> 00:53:41.559
船长斯麦克是最错的那个
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.


825
00:53:41.722 --> 00:53:46.102
我认为波星人就不应该来斯麦克星
I am thinking the Boov should never have come to Smekland.


826
00:53:46.268 --> 00:53:48.612
来地球
To Earthland.


827
00:53:49.104 --> 00:53:53.029
我想说 很抱歉
So I am saying the sorry to you...


828
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:54.818
小费·图奇
Gratuity Tucci.


829
00:54:03.827 --> 00:54:05.955
叫我小钱就好
Call me Tip.


830
00:54:11.335 --> 00:54:15.260
那是一个新家 新国度
It was a new home, a new country.


831
00:54:15.422 --> 00:54:17.140
我试图在学校里交朋友...
I tried to make friends at school...


832
00:54:17.299 --> 00:54:21.145
但我却是个来自巴巴多斯的书呆子
but I was this nerd from Barbados.


833
00:54:21.303 --> 00:54:24.352
但是你的几何是A啊
But you dids to get an "A" in geometry.


834
00:54:24.514 --> 00:54:26.061
是啊
Yeah, I did.


835
00:54:26.683 --> 00:54:29.527
我知道当别的波星人说 "欧" 的时候...
I know when the other Boovs said "Oh"...


836
00:54:29.686 --> 00:54:32.235
他们是不想看到我
they were not happy to see me.


837
00:54:33.815 --> 00:54:36.910
事实是 在波星人里 我和他们不合群
The true is, among Boov, I do not fit in.


838
00:54:37.778 --> 00:54:39.246
他们排斥我
I fit out.


839
00:54:42.157 --> 00:54:44.330
她特别棒
She is so amazing.


840
00:54:44.493 --> 00:54:46.621
她会留下所有的东西...
She saved up everything she had...


841
00:54:46.787 --> 00:54:49.757
这样我们就能搬家并且可以生活得好一点
so we could move and things would be better for us.


842
00:54:50.082 --> 00:54:52.961
我等不及去见我妈妈了
I cannot wait to meet Mimom.


843
00:54:57.923 --> 00:55:00.767
"我是船长斯麦克 嘘 嘘 嘘"
"My name is Captain Smek. Shush, shush, shush."


844
00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:06.433
"波星人的技术对于你这种思想简单的人类女孩来说太复杂了"
"Boov technology is far too complicated for simple humansgirl to figure out."


845
00:56:33.977 --> 00:56:35.069
他们是怎么发现我们的?
How did they find us?


846
00:56:35.228 --> 00:56:36.480
我不知道啊!
I do not know!


847
00:56:43.153 --> 00:56:45.201
等等 他们没有攻击
Wait. They're not attacking.


848
00:56:45.363 --> 00:56:47.411
因为他们在逃跑
Because they are running away.


849
00:56:48.575 --> 00:56:49.997
他们为什么逃跑?
Why are they running away?


850
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.912
原因只有一个
There can only be one reason.


851
00:57:05.133 --> 00:57:06.133
瓜星人来了
Gorg.


852
00:57:06.635 --> 00:57:09.479
这怎么可能 我把信号断掉了啊
This makes no sense. I stopped the message.


853
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:11.807
瓜星人找不到我们
Gorg cannot to finding us.


854
00:57:12.516 --> 00:57:13.813
那他们怎么来的?
Then how did they?


855
00:57:13.975 --> 00:57:16.194
一定还有别的原因!
There must be some other reason!


856
00:57:20.607 --> 00:57:22.109
哦 在我们身后
Oh, behind us!


857
00:57:22.275 --> 00:57:24.027
启动武器系统
Engage weapons system.


858
00:57:24.194 --> 00:57:25.696
我们还有武器系统?
We have a weapons system?


859
00:57:30.492 --> 00:57:32.745
发射卷饼鱼雷!
Go, Burrito Torpedo!


860
00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:36.330
真棒!
Yes!


861
00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:41.003
我们中弹了! 我们失去"逃跑的葡萄"了!
We've been hit! We're losing Grape Escape!


862
00:57:41.169 --> 00:57:42.591
我们失去"扭曲橘子"了!
We lost Tangerine Twist!


863
00:57:42.754 --> 00:57:45.803
如果我们再失去布斯塔莱姆 我就没法控制了!
If we lose Busta Lime, I cannot control!


864
00:57:46.007 --> 00:57:47.759
系好安全带! 我们要坠毁了!
Click and ticket. We are to crash!


865
00:57:47.926 --> 00:57:48.926
天哪!
Oh!


866
00:58:06.736 --> 00:58:07.736
不要啊
No, no, no.


867
00:58:08.071 --> 00:58:09.414
雪泥感! 不要啊!
Slushious! No!


868
00:58:11.783 --> 00:58:13.376
别光站着啊! 帮忙来!
Don't just stand there! Help!


869
00:58:14.911 --> 00:58:16.584
不要啊!
Come on, come on, come on!


870
00:58:16.746 --> 00:58:19.090
雪泥感! 不要啊!
Slushious! No!


871
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:27.132
她坏了
She's gone.


872
00:58:27.299 --> 00:58:28.300
我们完蛋了
We are doomed.


873
00:58:28.466 --> 00:58:29.968
我们永远都去不了澳大利亚了
Now I'll never make it to Australia.


874
00:58:30.135 --> 00:58:32.263
我来唱波星人死亡之歌
I will now sing the Boov Death Song.


875
00:58:41.104 --> 00:58:42.151
有一艘瓜星人飞船!
A Gorg ship!


876
00:58:42.314 --> 00:58:43.874
打断死亡之歌是很不礼貌的
It is rude to interrupt the Death Song.


877
00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.910
你可以拆掉它的零件来修我们的车
Maybe you could take the parts from it to fix our car.


878
00:58:47.152 --> 00:58:49.996
我不行 那是瓜星人的零件 它们用的是公制单位
I cannot. Those are Gorg parts. They are metric.


879
00:58:50.155 --> 00:58:52.658
我们马上就要到了 不能放弃
We're not getting this close and giving up.


880
00:58:52.824 --> 00:58:53.916
- 来吧  - 不!
- Come on.  - No!


881
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:56.127
到处乱跑总是会有危险的
Always with the running towards danger.


882
00:58:56.411 --> 00:58:59.665
别这么胆小了 这是我们唯一的机会了 来吧
Stop being such a Boov. It's our only chance. Come on.


883
00:59:02.751 --> 00:59:05.345
这成功率很低!
This has low probability of success!


884
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:13.807
- 走吧  - 等等!
- Let's go.  - Wait!


885
00:59:14.095 --> 00:59:15.142
等什么?
For what?


886
00:59:15.597 --> 00:59:17.270
等你反悔
For you to change your mind.


887
00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:18.600
走吧
Come on.


888
00:59:35.158 --> 00:59:36.159
里面没有飞行员
There's no pilot.


889
00:59:36.326 --> 00:59:37.953
这是个无人机
It is just a drone.


890
00:59:41.539 --> 00:59:43.041
被严重损坏
That could have been badness.


891
00:59:43.208 --> 00:59:44.710
但我们还是不安全
But we are not safety.


892
00:59:44.876 --> 00:59:47.299
瓜星人的母舰很快就会到这里了
Gorg mothership will be here soon enough.


893
00:59:49.547 --> 00:59:50.844
你能找到有用的东西吗?
Can you use any of this?


894
00:59:51.007 --> 00:59:52.224
坏的
Broken.


895
00:59:52.384 --> 00:59:53.510
没用
Useless.


896
00:59:53.677 --> 00:59:55.679
很可能导致核裂变
Likely to cause thermonuclear fission.


897
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.017
那是什么?
What is it?


898
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.476
瓜星人的超级芯片!
It is Gorg super-chip!


899
01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:05.530
为什么叫超级芯片?
Why is it called a super-chip?


900
01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:06.861
叫这名字好卖
It is mostly marketing.


901
01:00:07.023 --> 01:00:08.696
但它是
But it is key...


902
01:00:08.858 --> 01:00:12.533
让瓜星人的机器强于所有机器的关键
for the Gorg are having machines that are stronger and better at everything.


903
01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.698
所以我们和他们永远不可能有公平的战斗
So we can never fight them with equaltude.


904
01:00:14.864 --> 01:00:16.366
我们能用它来修雪泥感吗?
Can we use it to fix Slushious?


905
01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:18.831
能 能! 雪泥感会再次起飞的
Yes, yes! The Slushious will fly again.


906
01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:20.041
太棒了!
Yes!


907
01:00:29.087 --> 01:00:31.761
成功率很低
It was low probability of success.


908
01:00:31.923 --> 01:00:33.891
你能行
Some Boov you are.


909
01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:36.677
快点
Quickly.


910
01:00:36.761 --> 01:00:38.684
我们必须修好雪泥感 然后找到我妈妈
We must fix the Slushious and find Mimom.


911
01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:39.894
是 "我" 妈妈
"My" mom.


912
01:00:40.056 --> 01:00:41.228
我就是这么说的啊
That is the thing I said.


913
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.689
我就知道会成功的!
I knew this would all work out!


914
01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:48.781
你太棒了!
You were awesome!


915
01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.066
我们会找到我妈妈...
We're gonna find my mom...


916
01:00:50.233 --> 01:00:53.077
你要给大家展示你的超级芯片并成为一个大英雄...
you're gonna show everybody the super-chip and be a big hero...


917
01:00:53.236 --> 01:00:55.614
甚至是船长斯麦克都要...
and even Captain Smek will have to...


918
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.748
好多人啊
That's a lot of people.


919
01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:08.385
- 再见 波星人!  - 快点走吧!
- Bye, Boov!  - Get lost!


920
01:01:21.389 --> 01:01:24.814
哇 你们还真是挺会跑路的啊
Wow. You guys really are good at running away.


921
01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:25.977
是啊
Yes.


922
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.113
我们确实挺会的
Yes, we are.


923
01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:37.613
快看 在那!
Look, over there!


924
01:01:37.655 --> 01:01:39.282
我看到妈妈曾在那个地方!
That's where we saw my mom!


925
01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.339
快点 这是最后一艘船了!
Hurry up, it is the last ship!


926
01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:56.474
没事的 小猪 我会带妈妈一起回来的
It's okay, Pig. I'll be back with Mom.


927
01:02:00.345 --> 01:02:01.345
我们快到啦!
We're almost there!


928
01:02:01.346 --> 01:02:02.346
这边
Over here.


929
01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:03.439
- 什么啊?  - 快点!
- What?  - Hurry!


930
01:02:10.605 --> 01:02:13.199
我不明白 她在那里吗?
I don't understand. She's in there?


931
01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:16.819
是的
Yes.


932
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.872
说实话
Tell me the truth.


933
01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:21.374
没时间了
There is no time.


934
01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:23.160
你可以和我一起走
You can come with me.


935
01:02:23.326 --> 01:02:25.624
你会很安全的
You will be safety.


936
01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:30.463
我妈根本没在那艘船上 是不是?
My mom's not on that ship, is she?


937
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.509
你答应过我要帮我找到她 可你现在却要走了?
You promised to help me find her, and you're leaving?


938
01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:38.891
- 你个大骗子  - 不是这样的!
- You lied to me. - No!


939
01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.144
骗人不是件好事
A lie is a bad thing.


940
01:02:41.302 --> 01:02:43.396
可我却因此救了你啊
I did a thing so you can live.


941
01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:46.024
我妈在这里 我才不走
I'm not going. My mom is here.


942
01:02:46.182 --> 01:02:47.525
你绝对找不到她的
You will never find her.


943
01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:49.061
百分之百找不到
It is 100%.


944
01:02:49.227 --> 01:02:51.696
待在这里没有任何希望
Staying now does not make hope.


945
01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.903
瓜星人的母舰很快就要来了
Gorg mothership will be here soon.


946
01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.201
它会摧毁这个星球的
It destroys planets.


947
01:02:57.026 --> 01:02:58.994
- 我们必须现在就走!  - 我不要!
- We must run away now!  - No!


948
01:02:59.154 --> 01:03:00.406
原来是真的
It is true.


949
01:03:00.572 --> 01:03:04.042
人类竟然连这么简单明了的事情都想不明白
Humanspersons cannot even understand simple, simple things.


950
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.749
我是在救你! 我是你的朋友
I am saving you! I am being your friend.


951
01:03:06.911 --> 01:03:09.380
没有 你只是在逃命
No, you're just running away.


952
01:03:09.539 --> 01:03:11.837
我们不能抛弃自己的家人
You don't leave your family.


953
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.280
但你无法理解这个道理
But you can't understand that...


954
01:03:13.376 --> 01:03:15.549
因为你只是个波星人!
because you're just a Boov!


955
01:03:16.754 --> 01:03:19.598
你我从来就不是一类的
You've never been my friend.


956
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:28.390
等等!
Wait!


957
01:03:28.516 --> 01:03:30.689
最后逃离飞船马上就要起飞
Final escape pod departing.


958
01:04:12.977 --> 01:04:16.151
我讨厌瓜星人! 他们总能找到我们
I hate upon the Gorg! They are always finding us!


959
01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:17.736
瓜星人的母舰!
The Gorg mothership!


960
01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:36.087
我们死定了!
We are doomed!


961
01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:37.251
快逃啊!
Run away!


962
01:04:37.293 --> 01:04:38.966
快让开 我抱着孩子呢
Make a path, I'm holding a baby.


963
01:04:47.011 --> 01:04:48.934
是那个逃犯!
It is the fugitive Boov!


964
01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:51.145
他怎么往母舰那边跑!
He is running towards the danger!


965
01:04:51.474 --> 01:04:52.475
快拦住他!
Stop him!


966
01:05:04.445 --> 01:05:05.662
不要啊!
Undo!


967
01:05:24.674 --> 01:05:27.518
船长 我们的飞船达到了史上最高速
Captain, we are achieving new highest speeds!


968
01:05:28.803 --> 01:05:31.647
你做了什么啊? 那是个什么东西?
What has you done? What is that thing?


969
01:05:32.181 --> 01:05:33.979
瓜星人的超级芯片
It is Gorg super-chip.


970
01:05:34.475 --> 01:05:35.475
啥?
What?


971
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.732
瓜星人的无人机坠毁...
Gorg drone crashed...


972
01:05:36.894 --> 01:05:39.192
被我碰巧撞上 然后我就发现了这个芯片
and I ran to it and I found the chip.


973
01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:40.026
够了
Enough.


974
01:05:40.189 --> 01:05:42.032
你碰上了瓜星人?
You ran to a Gorg?


975
01:05:43.526 --> 01:05:45.369
他居然直面危机?
He runs towards the danger?


976
01:05:45.528 --> 01:05:46.871
他是个怎样的波星人啊?
What kind of Boov is he?


977
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:50.000
他简直是超级波星人
He is like a Super Boov.


978
01:05:50.158 --> 01:05:52.206
不 不 不
No, no, no.


979
01:05:52.368 --> 01:05:53.995
他才不是什么超级波星人
He is not a Super Boov.


980
01:05:54.162 --> 01:05:58.008
在这艘船上只有一个超级波星人 并且你们知道我说的是谁
There is only one Super Boov on this ship, and you know who it is.


981
01:05:58.166 --> 01:05:59.543
近在眼前哦
You're looking at him.


982
01:05:59.709 --> 01:06:01.711
是我组织的大逃亡
I invented running away.


983
01:06:01.878 --> 01:06:05.178
还有看这里 我有嘘嘘棒
And look at this. I have the Shusher.


984
01:06:05.423 --> 01:06:07.551
我才是你们的船长
I am your captain.


985
01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:09.219
但你不是个合格的船长
But you are not good captain.


986
01:06:09.385 --> 01:06:10.432
什么?
What?


987
01:06:10.595 --> 01:06:13.940
你告诉了我们很多事 我们都信了
You telled us these things, and we all believed them.


988
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:15.892
起码我相信了
I believed them.


989
01:06:16.684 --> 01:06:19.563
直到我遇见一个人类
But then I met a humansperson.


990
01:06:20.396 --> 01:06:22.569
她却并不像你所说的那样
And she is not like you said.


991
01:06:24.359 --> 01:06:27.033
她勇敢 聪明
She is brave and smart...


992
01:06:27.195 --> 01:06:30.574
关心其他的人类
and cares about other humanspersons.


993
01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:34.916
可我们波星人却从来都不会关心彼此
In a way that we Boov do not even care about each other.


994
01:06:36.954 --> 01:06:39.082
她甚至还很关心我
She even cares about me.


995
01:06:39.707 --> 01:06:42.256
虽然我并不值得她这么做
And I've done very little to earn that.


996
01:06:43.252 --> 01:06:46.131
或许波星人在许多方面都很优秀
The Boov may be superior in many ways...


997
01:06:46.422 --> 01:06:47.422
那是自然
Yeah.


998
01:06:47.423 --> 01:06:50.643
但却疏忽了最重要的东西
but not in the ways that I now thinks are most important.


999
01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:56.315
得了吧
Big deal!


1000
01:06:56.474 --> 01:06:57.726
我听够了 给我闭嘴!
I have had enough. Shush!


1001
01:07:00.645 --> 01:07:03.819
你才给我闭嘴
That is enough shushing.


1002
01:07:03.981 --> 01:07:05.824
你居然敢叫我闭嘴!
How dare you shush a shushing!


1003
01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:08.782
小欧说得对 我们需要一个新的船长
Oh is right. We need a new captain.


1004
01:07:09.237 --> 01:07:12.081
我认为小欧是不二人选
I thinks it should be Oh!


1005
01:07:12.615 --> 01:07:14.288
我? 不行的
Me? No.


1006
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:15.918
不行! 他才不配当船长
No! He cannot be captain.


1007
01:07:16.077 --> 01:07:18.330
我有嘘嘘棒 我才是船长!
I have the Shusher. I am captain!


1008
01:07:18.496 --> 01:07:19.496
再也不是了!
Not anymore!


1009
01:07:21.624 --> 01:07:23.251
他不知道怎么控制这个的
He will not know how to operate it!


1010
01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:24.965
这个非常复杂的
It is very complicated.


1011
01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:26.608
一头重 一头轻
Heavy on one end, light on the other.


1012
01:07:26.629 --> 01:07:27.630
闭嘴!
Shush!


1013
01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:29.803
棒!
Booyah!


1014
01:07:30.299 --> 01:07:32.802
不 我真的不配领导波星人
No, I am not a Leader Boov.


1015
01:07:32.969 --> 01:07:34.312
我犯了太多太多错误
I makes far too many mistakes.


1016
01:07:34.762 --> 01:07:37.606
你又不是唯一一个犯错误的波星人
You are not the only Boov who makes mistakes.


1017
01:07:38.307 --> 01:07:39.775
比如说...
For examples...


1018
01:07:39.934 --> 01:07:43.484
我最大的错误就是没做你的朋友
My mistake is not being your friend.


1019
01:07:50.528 --> 01:07:52.656
大家为小欧船长欢呼吧!
All hail Captain Oh!


1020
01:07:55.324 --> 01:07:56.450
我看到是谁干的了!
I saw who did that!


1021
01:07:56.617 --> 01:07:58.164
你给我等着瞧!
I hold grudges, you know!


1022
01:08:06.294 --> 01:08:07.637
小欧 你是最棒的!
Oh, you're the best!


1023
01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:10.299
想不想办个派对 小欧?
Want me to host party, Oh?


1024
01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:49.697
走开啦
Go away.


1025
01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:53.531
不对 你应该说 "是谁?"
No, you are supposed to be saying "Who is there?"


1026
01:09:53.693 --> 01:09:55.036
然后我就会说
Then I am to be saying...


1027
01:09:55.194 --> 01:09:56.411
"哞!"
"Moo!"


1028
01:09:56.571 --> 01:09:57.571
小欧!
Oh!


1029
01:09:59.615 --> 01:10:01.913
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe it!


1030
01:10:02.368 --> 01:10:04.120
可是我看到你们的飞船飞走了啊!
But I saw your ship leave!


1031
01:10:06.956 --> 01:10:10.130
但你却回来了 你还来这干什么?
But you came back! What are you doing here?


1032
01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:11.795
这里才是我心之所在
It is where I belongs.


1033
01:10:11.961 --> 01:10:14.760
你和小猪是我的朋友
You and Pigcat are my friends.


1034
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:17.092
还有...
And alsos, too...


1035
01:10:17.258 --> 01:10:19.135
我答应过你的
I gave you a promise.


1036
01:11:41.175 --> 01:11:42.392
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.


1037
01:11:45.805 --> 01:11:46.897
谢谢你
Thank you.


1038
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:51.982
妈妈
Mom.


1039
01:11:56.023 --> 01:11:57.570
小钱 我的乖女儿
Tippy. My beautiful girl.


1040
01:11:57.733 --> 01:12:00.407
妈妈 我到处找你
I've been looking everywhere, Mom.


1041
01:12:00.569 --> 01:12:03.197
我好害怕我们再也见不到了
I was so scared we'd never see each other again.


1042
01:12:03.364 --> 01:12:06.493
妈妈 我永远都不会放弃找你的
Mom, I never would have stopped looking until I found you.


1043
01:12:10.663 --> 01:12:12.586
他们还在找我们
They are still looking.


1044
01:12:29.223 --> 01:12:31.100
瓜星人不是掠夺者
Gorg are not the takers.


1045
01:12:31.934 --> 01:12:33.436
波星人才是
Boov are.


1046
01:12:37.815 --> 01:12:40.318
我们必须得等会再互诉衷肠了
We must demonstrate our affections later.


1047
01:12:40.484 --> 01:12:42.327
还有一个问题没解决
There is still one problem.


1048
01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:44.284
请问那是什么?
Excuse me, what is that?


1049
01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:47.291
那是瓜星人的母舰 它来摧毁这个星球了
That is Gorg mothership. It is here to destroy the planet.


1050
01:12:52.538 --> 01:12:53.858
它会毁了这个星球?
It's going to destroy the planet?


1051
01:12:53.998 --> 01:12:56.501
是的 但我有个主意
Yes. But I haves a plan.


1052
01:13:10.973 --> 01:13:12.099
小欧?
Oh?


1053
01:13:15.186 --> 01:13:16.358
你在做什么?
What are you doing?


1054
01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.022
对不起
I am sorry.


1055
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:20.863
小钱现在不能出来
Tip cannot come into the out now.


1056
01:13:21.025 --> 01:13:22.993
我要弥补我的过错
I am fixing my mistake.


1057
01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:26.706
小欧 你不能一个人做这件事!
Oh! You can't do this on your own!


1058
01:13:26.864 --> 01:13:28.582
也许是不能
Maybe not.


1059
01:13:28.741 --> 01:13:30.789
但我还是心存希望
But I haves hope.


1060
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:34.797
不!
No!


1061
01:13:34.955 --> 01:13:36.081
停下 别!
Stop, no!


1062
01:13:37.166 --> 01:13:38.668
不要自己一个人去啊!
Please don't do this by yourself!


1063
01:13:44.882 --> 01:13:45.929
不! 不要!
No! Don't!


1064
01:13:47.051 --> 01:13:48.348
小欧!
Oh!


1065
01:14:07.738 --> 01:14:10.241
快停下!
Stop!


1066
01:14:13.786 --> 01:14:15.538
快看呐!
Look!


1067
01:14:21.752 --> 01:14:23.004
嘿!
Hey!


1068
01:14:30.427 --> 01:14:32.145
瓜星人!
Gorg!


1069
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:34.974
光喊没什么用
It is useless to yell.


1070
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:36.484
瓜星人!
Gorg!


1071
01:14:45.818 --> 01:14:47.240
他们看不见他
They're not gonna see him.


1072
01:14:47.403 --> 01:14:48.575
根本不行啊!
It's not gonna work!


1073
01:14:49.446 --> 01:14:50.493
圣诞节快乐
Merry Christmas.


1074
01:14:50.656 --> 01:14:52.124
- 现在?  - 快打开
- Now?  - Just open it.


1075
01:14:55.119 --> 01:14:57.121
亲爱的 谢谢 但...
Thank you, sweetheart, but what...


1076
01:14:57.788 --> 01:14:58.539
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?


1077
01:14:58.706 --> 01:15:00.800
让驾驶员分心
Distracting the driver.


1078
01:15:35.367 --> 01:15:37.586
起作用了! 母舰停下来了！
It worked! The ship's stopping!


1079
01:15:45.127 --> 01:15:46.549
但却不能及时停下来！
It's not gonna stop in time!


1080
01:15:54.386 --> 01:15:55.979
快停下来!
Stop faster!


1081
01:15:56.138 --> 01:15:58.015
他要赶紧离开那儿！
He's gotta get out of there!


1082
01:15:59.183 --> 01:16:01.686
妈妈 快帮我搞定这东西
Mom, help me with this thing!


1083
01:16:10.486 --> 01:16:11.487
小欧!
Oh!


1084
01:16:11.987 --> 01:16:12.987
小欧!
Oh!


1085
01:16:13.072 --> 01:16:14.494
快跑!
Run!


1086
01:16:14.782 --> 01:16:15.453
小钱!
Tip!


1087
01:16:15.616 --> 01:16:16.663
快停下来!
Stop!


1088
01:16:16.825 --> 01:16:18.077
小钱!
Tip!


1089
01:17:21.056 --> 01:17:22.057
妈!
Mom!


1090
01:17:53.589 --> 01:17:54.681
小欧!
Oh!


1091
01:18:00.429 --> 01:18:01.601
你还活着
You're alive.


1092
01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:04.108
但是你吓死我了!
But you scared me so bad!


1093
01:18:04.266 --> 01:18:05.768
你吓坏啦?
You were scared?


1094
01:18:05.934 --> 01:18:08.028
我也差点吓"屎"了
I almost made a number three.


1095
01:18:08.187 --> 01:18:09.187
也不是很难
Not too hard!


1096
01:18:09.271 --> 01:18:11.774
还是存在可能性的
It is still a possibility.


1097
01:20:21.111 --> 01:20:23.239
你们说了什么啊?
What was all that?


1098
01:20:23.405 --> 01:20:27.035
不是所有的瓜星人语言都能对应成人类的语言
Not all Gorg-speak has humans words.


1099
01:20:27.201 --> 01:20:31.752
但显然 瓜星人不是因为我的邀请来这里的
But, it turns out, Gorg was not here because of my invitation...


1100
01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:34.212
虽然瓜星人还蛮乐意参加的
though Gorg would have been happy to attend.


1101
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:39.426
瓜星人来这是因为追踪到这块石头
Gorg was here because Gorg was tracking the rock.


1102
01:20:39.588 --> 01:20:41.090
里面装的是什么?
What was in that thing?


1103
01:20:41.256 --> 01:20:42.382
瓜星人的族系
Gorg family.


1104
01:20:42.966 --> 01:20:45.810
他们的整个后代族系
It is entire next generation.


1105
01:20:46.094 --> 01:20:47.437
整个?
All of them?


1106
01:20:47.971 --> 01:20:49.439
整个
All of them.


1107
01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.073
难怪他们要一直追着你了
No wonder they've been chasing you.


1108
01:21:02.778 --> 01:21:05.281
不是 "他们" 是 "他"
Not "they," "he."


1109
01:21:05.447 --> 01:21:09.293
显然 那个瓜星人是他们星球最后一个了
Apparently, that Gorg is last Gorg.


1110
01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:11.453
所以这块石头才会如此重要
That is why rock was so important.


1111
01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.622
没有这块石头 他就会非常寂寞...
Without it, he was alonely...


1112
01:21:13.789 --> 01:21:16.212
接着在某一天就灭绝了...
and would someday be extinctly...


1113
01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:19.424
这才让瓜星人变得古怪 不通情理...
which made Gorg cranky and irrational...


1114
01:21:19.586 --> 01:21:21.805
并且还有暴力倾向
and physically violent.


1115
01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:23.932
他其实就像人类女孩一样
He was just like humansgirl.


1116
01:21:25.384 --> 01:21:28.979
只是伤心得发疯了
He was sad-mad.


1117
01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:38.151
谢谢你
Thanking you.


1118
01:21:38.647 --> 01:21:40.991
谢谢你! 漂亮的击掌
Thanking you! High hand touching.


1119
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:42.822
对 这里 再来个
Yeah, give it here. High hand touching.


1120
01:21:42.985 --> 01:21:45.329
再高点! 你太慢啦
Up high! You are too slow.


1121
01:21:46.488 --> 01:21:49.116
击掌! 这下好痛
High hand touching! That hurt.


1122
01:21:55.492 --> 01:21:59.415
两周后

1123
01:22:14.683 --> 01:22:15.684
小猪猫咪!
Pigcat!


1124
01:22:17.352 --> 01:22:18.353
嘿 小欧!

1125
01:22:20.272 --> 01:22:21.524
你好啊 我的朋友凯尔

1126
01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:23.613
我也有一样的颜色

1127
01:22:23.775 --> 01:22:25.652

小欧! 这个派对太棒啦!

1129
01:22:27.279 --> 01:22:30.123
有人参加的派对才更加有趣嘛!
Parties are so much more fun when other people show up.


1130
01:22:30.782 --> 01:22:32.455
是时候该把场子再弄热一些了吧?
Is it time to pick it up a level?


1131
01:22:32.618 --> 01:22:33.618
当然!
Yes!


1132
01:22:34.536 --> 01:22:36.163
那会更加热闹的!
This is gonna be sweet!


1133
01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:38.332
让我们一起发烧起来吧
Drop it like it has a high temperature!


1134
01:22:53.388 --> 01:22:54.560
哎呀 不是吧!
Oh, no!


1135
01:22:57.726 --> 01:22:59.569
我的身体怎么回事?
What is happening to my body?


1136
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.902
一起摇摆起来吧!
Shake your Boov thang!


1137
01:23:07.486 --> 01:23:10.410
我的手好像不自觉得就举起来了!
My hands are in the air like I just do not care!


1138
01:23:14.576 --> 01:23:19.423
我有了新的开始 新的家 还有新的朋友
