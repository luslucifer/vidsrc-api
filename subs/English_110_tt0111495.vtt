Come here.

<i>320 04 86.</i>

4
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.590
<i>Leave your name and number
and I’ll get back to you.</i>


5
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.950
<i>Valentine?</i>

6
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.350
<i>Are you home?
Are you there?</i>


7
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.750
<i>I’ll call back later.</i>

8
00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:33.645
Michel...
I was having breakfast.


9
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.190
<i>First it was busy, now the machine.
Are you alone?</i>


10
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.110
Alone.

11
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.270
<i>All alone?</i>

12
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.830
All alone. They just called me
for a photo session.


13
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.710
They want to see me.

14
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.670
When did you get back?

15
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.870
<i>Yesterday. I called,
but you weren't home.</i>


16
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.030
<i>Our car was stolen in Poland.
They got everything:</i>


17
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.870
<i>passports, money, clothes, everything.</i>

18
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.790
So what happened?

19
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.950
<i>We found a nice guy
who put us up.</i>


20
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.910
<i>The Embassy gave us money
and passports. We made it home.</i>


21
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.510
Michel?

22
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.630
I felt lonely last night.

23
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.430
<i>What did you do?</i>

24
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.750
All night long,
I slept with your jacket.


25
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.710
I wanted to be with you.

26
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.815
<i>I can't now, 
Valentine.</i>

27
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.398
I know.
What's the weather like there?


28
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.630
<i>Typical English weather:
it's pouring.</i>


29
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.590
It rained here yesterday.

30
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.805
Now it's sunny. 
It's springtime.

31
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.437
<i>What did you do last night?</i>

32
00:03:38.462 --> 00:03:42.350
At the cinema.
I went to see "The Dead Poets Society".


33
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.350
<i>What a good movie!</i>

34
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.590
Yes, I liked it a lot.

35
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.150
<i>I'll call you tonight.</i>

36
00:03:46.284 --> 00:03:48.859
I’ll be back at 7. 
I’ll stay in.

37
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.790
<i>I’ll talk to you later.</i>

38
00:03:49.815 --> 00:03:51.066
- Michel?
<i>- Yes?</i>


39
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.270
I miss you.

40
00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:55.638
<i>Me too.</i>

41
00:03:55.663 --> 00:03:56.810
Kisses.

<i>Personal weather reports.</i>

43
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.150
Hello.

44
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.190
Lose?

45
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.870
<i>Take that out.</i>

46
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.030
Take your sweater.

47
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.310
<i>Tie it around your neck.</i>

48
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.950
<i>The sleeve too.</i>

49
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.110
Like this?

50
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.310
<i>Give me a profile.</i>

51
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.590
No, don't smile.

52
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.750
<i>Be sad.</i>

53
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.430
<i>Sadder.
Think of something awful.</i>


54
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.430
<i>There.</i>

55
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.270
<i>Sad.</i>

56
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.190
<i>Now it's coming!
That's it!</i>


57
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.270
<i>Turn. And 6 and 7
on the bar.</i>


58
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.990
<i>And 1 and 2
and 3 and 4 and stretch,</i>


59
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.439
<i>and 6 and 7 and 8 and bend,</i>

60
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.110
<i>and 3 and 4 and arch,</i>

61

<i>and 6 and 7 and stretch,

62
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.590
<i>Stretch out your chin,
your arm, your fingertips.</i>


63
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.950
<i>Stretch out your hand. 
Your neck.</i>

64
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.351
<i>Relax your toes.
Stretch.</i>


65
00:06:15.357 --> 00:06:16.119
Good day.

66
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.710
I almost fell!

Excuse me...
The door was open.


71
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.190
I'm sorry, I ran over your dog.

72
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.482
Rita. A German shepherd.

73
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.630
That's possible.

74
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.710
<i>She disappeared yesterday.</i>

75
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.279
She's in my car. Alive.

76
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.430
I don't know what to do.

77
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.390
Should I take her to a veterinarian?

78
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.230
As you wish.

79
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.430
If I ran over your daughter...

80
00:13:32.087 --> 00:13:34.287
-would you be so indifferent?

81
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.910
I have no daughter, Miss.

82
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.070
Go away.

83
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.679
<i>Don't close the door!</i>

84
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.827
She's fine.
We stitched her up.


85
00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:46.652
Otherwise, she has a few bruises.

86
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.430
She'll need some rest.

87

She's pregnant.

<i>Will you take her
or leave her here?</i>


89
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.110
I'll take her.

90
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.270
<i>We'll help you carry her.</i>

91
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.870
<i>Marc?</i>

92
00:15:02.858 --> 00:15:03.578
<i>Marc?</i>

93
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.350
<i>Are you alone?</i>

94
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.790
<i>No.</i>

95
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.833
Tell him something.
Come on.


96
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.500
Did you hear?
I have a dog.


97
00:15:27.658 --> 00:15:30.550
<i>A dog?</i>
A dog. I ran her over.


98
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.870
Michel, I'm sorry.

99
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.470
<i>That wasn't funny.</i>

100
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.830
No, it wasn't.

101
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.190
<i>I knew it was a joke.
As if I could see you laughing.</i>


102
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.341
Do you remember how we met?

103
00:15:43.455 --> 00:15:44.535
<i>I remember...</i>

104
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.110
We're lucky I stepped
out during the break.


105
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.310
<i>That's true.</i>

106
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.110
<i>Valentine, return the dog.</i>

107
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.830
I tried.
The owner doesn't want it.


108
00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.550
<i>Who is he?</i>

109
00:16:00.804 --> 00:16:03.267
I hear an alarm.
Could be my car.


110
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.030
It is my car.

111
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.870
Wait for me to turn it off.

112
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.150
<i>I'm in a hurry.</i>

113
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.190
I understand.

114
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.310
Move.

115
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.830
<i>We could use these.</i>

116
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.510
<i>I'd say:
"In any situation, a breath of life".</i>


117
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.390
Which do you prefer?

118
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.070
I like this one.

119
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.510
Me too.

120
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.790
8 meters by 20.

121
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.430
Will they recognize you?

122
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.550
Who?

123
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.350
Who are you thinking of?

124
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.750
Not you.

125
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.350
Well, that's a bad sign.

126
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.550
I think I know why I won.
Goodbye.

I have no idea.

Or someone who looks like him.

Good morning. May I speak to Marie, please?

I’ll let you go so you can run.

But don't run away, okay?

145

Promise?

Excuse me.

Call her. She's yours.

- For the vet.

- You found my address?
- That was easy.

You don't know the price.

What about Rita?

She's a very clever dog. Very.

160
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.030
Take her.

161
00:23:38.824 --> 00:23:41.306
- You don't want her?
- I want nothing.


162
00:23:43.726 --> 00:23:45.830
Then, why not stop breathing?

163
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:47.670
Good idea.

164
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.950
Have you stopped breathing?

Sir?

00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:03.926
<i>If you don't come,
you'll never see me again.</i>


167
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.270
<i>But today is Sunday.</i>

168
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.910
<i>Yesterday was Saturday,
and you were with me.</i>


169
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.990
<i>Excuse me, Sir, I can't talk.
We're about to have lunch.</i>


170
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.650
<i>I'd ask one thing of you:
-Don't call me "Sir".</i>


171
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.150
<i>Speak to me like you did yesterday.
Call me Pierre. Or Pierrot.</i>


172
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.750
<i>Call me "My love".
Say: "My love..."</i>


173
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.662
<i>Please excuse me.
Let me pick up the phone in the other room.</i>


174
00:25:36.658 --> 00:25:37.408
<i>Pierre?</i>

175
00:25:41.102 --> 00:25:42.228
<i>Pierre, I'm alone.</i>

176
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.810
<i>I'm also alone. 
Far away from you.</i>

177
00:25:44.927 --> 00:25:47.750
<i>And I want you to
come over. I don't want to be alone!</i>


178
00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:48.839
<i>Pierre...</i>

179
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:52.543
<i>You'll see me tomorrow.
- I miss you.</i>


180
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.485
<i>You must understand...</i>

181
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.150
<i>I don't want to understand!
I think about you.</i>


182
00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:01.190
<i>You're naked in front of the mirror.
But for someone else, not for me.</i>


183
00:26:02.324 --> 00:26:05.097
<i>I want to kiss you.
I lean forward...</i>


184
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:06.970
<i>I touch your lips...</i>

185
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.809
What are you doing?
<i>This is my favourite...</i>


186
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.030
I'm spying.

187
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.440
<i>What?</i>

188
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.573
I'm listening to my
neighbors' phone calls.


189
00:26:25.906 --> 00:26:29.675
You cut it off just as it
was getting interesting...


190
00:26:33.171 --> 00:26:35.091
<i>You don't find it entertaining?</i>

191
00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.803
It’s disgusting.

192
00:26:36.888 --> 00:26:37.648
Yes.

193
00:26:38.469 --> 00:26:40.229
What's more, it's illegal.

194
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.550
Your 30 francs.

195
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.710
<i>One minute, Miss.</i>

196
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.630
You're convinced you are correct, right?

197
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.950
<i>Yes.</i>

198
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.390
Then why don't you do anything?

199
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.910
What?

200
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.270
<i>Can't I touch your scar?
Like yesterday?</i>


201
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.870
Go see this man.

202
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.070
Tell him someone listens
to his conversations.


203
00:27:22.978 --> 00:27:26.146
And while you're at it,
tell him it's me.


204
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.350
I will.

205
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.350
It’s that house.

206
00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:39.199
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.


207
00:27:40.691 --> 00:27:42.189
- I would like to speak to Mr...
- My husband?


208
00:27:42.214 --> 00:27:46.684
He's upstairs on the phone.
Please excuse me, I have to shut off the gas.


209
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.030
Come in, please.

210
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.289
<i>Have a seat.</i>
He'll be right down.


211
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:25.070
Caroline... Leave the phone.
Dad is talking.


212
00:28:26.386 --> 00:28:27.066
Excuse me.

213
00:28:27.413 --> 00:28:28.822
I'm at the wrong address.

214
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.510
<i>This is number 22.</i>

215
00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.310
I'm very sorry.

216
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.670
No problem.

217
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.630
Have a good day.

218
00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:14.390
Goodbye.

219
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.230
I'll call you later.

220
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.990
You lost this.

221
00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.630
<i>So? Did you tell him?</i>

222
00:29:47.694 --> 00:29:48.444
No.

223
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.390
Would you like
something to drink?


224
00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.950
No, I wouldn't.

225
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.670
<i>I came back...</i>

226
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:05.270
I came back to ask you something.

227
00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.070
<i>Don't do this anymore.</i>

228
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.070
<i>I've done it all my life.</i>

229
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.430
What were you?

230
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.910
<i>A cop?</i>

231
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.470
Worse. A judge.

232
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:43.630
A judge?

233
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.670
<i>You've never seen one for real?</i>

234
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.590
Would you like to try?
It makes...


235
00:30:57.615 --> 00:30:58.855
<i>a lovely sound.</i>

236
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.990
<i>I don't know whether I was
on the good or the bad side.</i>


237
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.750
Here, at least, I know
where the truth is.


238
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.550
<i>It's a clearer view
than in a courtroom.</i>


239
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:18.590
No.

240
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.430
Everyone deserves a private life.

241
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.350
<i>Of course.</i>

242
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.630
Why did you stop short?
Why didn't you tell him I'm spying?


243
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.190
Because he has a sweet wife?

244
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.950
<i>
-Devoted to him?</i>

245
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:43.310
<i>And a beautiful little daughter who loves him?
-So you couldn't.</i>


246
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.990
<i>Did you feel remorse?</i>

247
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.550
<i>
-Or were you afraid to do harm?</i>

248
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.670
Maybe both.

249
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.350
Let me tell you;

250
00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.710
It matters little whether I
spy - or you tell them.


251
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.550
Sooner or later,

252
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.950
<i>it'll be thrown out the window.</i>

253
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.920
<i>
-Or, it'll be she who discovers everything.</i>

254
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:15.470
<i>Someone will tell their daughter -
and there will be a living hell.</i>


255
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.404
What can we do about it?

256
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.030
<i>Why are you so quiet?</i>

257
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.630
Does this remind you of something?

258
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.430
- Yes.
<i>- What?</i>


259
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.870
-Say it.

260
00:32:35.798 --> 00:32:37.281
A boy I know.

261
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.470
A boy you know who...

262
00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:41.615
<i>What...</i>

263
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.910
found out his mother was a whore?

264
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.710
-Who learned...

265
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.310
he's not his father's son.

266
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.950
<i>He was fifteen.</i>

267
00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.630
That man's daughter...

268
00:33:03.576 --> 00:33:05.096
She knows too.

269
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.510
<i>Stay a minute.</i>

270
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.470
Why?

271
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.750
<i>The light is beautiful.</i>

272
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.510
<i>
- Personal weather reports.</i>

273
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.990
<i>
- I'm driving to Turin tomorrow.</i>

274
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.070
<i>- I checked. The weather
will be fine to Chamonix.</i>


275
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.470
<i>From Chamonix to the tunnel,
it may snow.</i>


276
00:33:36.603 --> 00:33:39.363
<i>And after the tunnel...
One minute...</i>


277
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.230
-I know the weather all over Europe.

278
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:44.605
<i>Up to Turin,
the weather will be fine.</i>


279
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.925
<i>Leave early to avoid the snow.</i>

280
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.750
<i>
- This service is a great idea.</i>

281
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.390
<i>
- Thank you. Goodbye.</i>

282
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.689
<i>
- Personal weather reports, how may I help you?</i>

283
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.070
<i>
- It’s me.</i>

284
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.470
<i>Did you get any sleep?</i>

285
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.630
<i>
- A little.</i>

286
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.110
<i>I didn't tell you.
By telephone it may be easier.</i>


287
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.070
<i>It was really great.</i>

288
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:22.950
<i>We'd never made love so well,
so long.</i>


289
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.750
<i>- We learned something.
Me from you. You from me.</i>


290
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.950
<i>When I woke up, you were
still sleeping. Like a child.</i>


291
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.270
<i>
- I'm older than you.</i>

292
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:35.390
<i>- One year!
- No, two.</i>


293
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:39.445
<i>- Okay. Two. But this morning, when I loooked
at you, I got scared.</i>


294
00:34:39.836 --> 00:34:41.436
<i>What is this leading to?</i>

295
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.699
<i>- You sound a little down.
- No.</i>


296
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.470
<i>- Are you nervous
about your exams?</i>


297
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:49.110
<i>- No. About what I'm going to do.
Will it be enough?</i>


298
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.570
<i>
- Why not go bowling?</i>

299
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.910
<i>
- I've already opened all my books.</i>

300
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:54.990
<i>Perhaps you're right.
Do you have a coin?</i>


301
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:55.990
<i>
- Yes.</i>

302
00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:00.030
<i>- Flip it. Tails is bowling.
Heads is Penal Code.</i>


303
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.750
<i>
- Tails. Bowling.</i>

304
00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.445
<i>- I’ll work a couple of hours more,
then I’ll call you.</i>


305
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.430
<i>
- Or I will.</i>

306
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.200
<i>I'll wait. If I go out,
it's just to buy cigarettes.</i>


307
00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:15.214
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>


308
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.630
<i>You didn't listen?</i>

309
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.070
<i>What a shame. 
It was romantic.</i>

310
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.790
I heard the beginning.

311
00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.790
<i>They're in love.</i>

312
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.430
Yes.

313
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.910
<i>He hasn't met the right woman yet.</i>

314
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.430
How do you know?

315
00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.910
I watch them from my window.

316
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.670
Do you think I'm a scoundrel?

317
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:53.710
<i>Yes.</i>

318
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.310
Come look.

319
00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:03.110
<i>That guy bought a telephone in Japan
that uses another wavelength.</i>


320
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:08.310
My radio can't pick it up.
Too bad.


321
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:14.150
I think he's responsible for most
of the heroin trade in Geneva.


322
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.750
We have nothing on him.

323
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.430
<i>He never takes risks.</i>

324
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.550
Do you like it?

325
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:27.550
Very much.

326
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:31.870
<i>I’ll call him.</i>

327
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:35.190
You have his phone number?

328
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.490
<i>-Hello?</i>
- You deserve to die.


329
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.481
What do I do?

330
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.110
Here's his phone number.

331
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:28.603
If you feel like saying mean
again, don't hesitate to call him.


332
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.565
<i>- At 10 o'clock, I turned off
the lights. I couldn't sleep.</i>


333
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.910
Next program.
-Not very interesting.


334
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.676
<i>I kept tossing and turning.
It kept hurting.</i>


335
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.950
<i>It still does.</i>

336
00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:53.470
<i>I haven't done the errands.</i>

337
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.765
<i>- I'm sorry, mother.
- I have no milk or bread.</i>


338
00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.990
<i>- I bought you some.
I put it in the freezer.</i>


339
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.165
<i>
- I ate it all.</i>

340
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:07.550
<i>- You didn't eat 7 loaves in 4 days.
I'm sick of this!</i>


341
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.870
Go do her errands.

342
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.996
Maybe you'd feel better.

343
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.830
Maybe she's the one
who'd feel better.


344
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.670
Why did you pick up Rita?

345
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.870
Because I had run her over.

346
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:31.990
<i>She was bleeding.</i>

347
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.148
Otherwise, you'd have felt guilty.

348
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.523
You'd have dreamt of a dog
with a crushed skull.


349
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:41.550
Yes.

350
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.110
So who did you do it for?

351
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.430
<i>Don't bother doing
that lady's errands.</i>


352
00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.150
<i>She has everything she needs.</i>

353
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.910
<i>She wants to see her daughter.</i>

354
00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.790
<i>She already came 5 times,</i>

355
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.510
<i>when her mother
faked a heart attack.</i>


356
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:08.350
After she dies,
I'll have to call the daughter.


357
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.076
She doesn't believe her any more.

358
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:17.390
You're mistaken.

359
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.710
<i>About what?</i>

360
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:21.830
About everything.

361
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:25.611
Everything.

362
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.165
People aren't bad.

363
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.350
<i>It's not true.</i>

364
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.830
Yes.

365
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.641
They may be weak sometimes...

366
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.805
The boy who learned
his father wasn't his father...


367
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.750
Was it your boyfriend or your brother?

368
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.525
My brother.

369
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.910
<i>How old is he?</i>

370
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.205
<i>16.</i>

371
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.750
How long
has he been shooting up?


372
00:39:58.295 --> 00:39:59.455
How do you know?

373
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.750
It wasn't hard to guess.

374
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.910
I can only feel pity for you.

375
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.169
Maybe you don't know...

376
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:21.870
<i>Your dog is pregnant.</i>

377
00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:38.190
It’s Valentine.

378
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.685
<i>Hello, darling.</i>

379
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.350
Mom, did Marc come?

380
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:44.510
<i>Two days ago. With his girlfriend.
Do you know her?</i>


381
00:42:44.535 --> 00:42:45.750
Yes. Marie.

382
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:48.670
<i>We're all together.
They're watching TV.</i>


383
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:50.746
I'm sorry I can't be there.

384
00:42:50.771 --> 00:42:52.851
Too bad.
It’s like old times.


385
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.710
<i>Your brother's a good boy.</i>

386
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:56.030
Can I talk to him?

387
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:57.710
<i>Marc!
He's coming.</i>


388
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.510
Call me, Mom.
I love you.


389
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.805
<i>Hi, Valentine.</i>

390
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.990
Thanks for going there.

391
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.790
<i>We're leaving tomorrow.
I can't stand it.</i>


392
00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.910
Mom didn't see the paper?

393
00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.710
<i>I don't think so.
She'd never believe it...</i>


394
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.845
You're right.
You should go home.


395
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.870
<i>Bye.</i>

396
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.990
Call me, Michel.

397
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.070
Please, call me.

398
00:43:27.353 --> 00:43:27.758
Hello?

399
00:43:27.782 --> 00:43:29.405
<i>Valentine?
Did you see the picture?</i>


400
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:30.430
The picture?

401
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:32.845
Is that you, Jacques?

402
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:35.190
<i>Isn't it amazing?
You didn't see it?</i>


403
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.405
I forgot.
I've had a hard day.


404
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.605
<i>Come meet us.
It'll relax you.</i>


405
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:41.408
Where?

406
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.750
<i>Not bad!</i>

407
00:43:51.974 --> 00:43:53.438
<i>Valentine...</i>

408
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.005
I'm sorry to bother you...

409
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.817
Someone played a stupid prank.
I can't get in.


410
00:47:13.655 --> 00:47:14.433
Those kids...

411
00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:16.498
<i>Turks. Always trouble.</i>

412
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:20.590
I don't know.
They stuck chewing gum in my lock.


413
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.350
<i>Tweezers.</i>

414
00:47:31.832 --> 00:47:32.382
Hello?

415
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:33.510
<i>It’s me.</i>

416
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:34.710
Hi, Michel...

417
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:36.790
<i>I just called.
There was no answer.</i>


418
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.472
Someone stuck chewing
gum in my lock.


419
00:47:39.497 --> 00:47:42.270
I couldn't get in.
-I heard the phone.


420
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.159
<i>- Chewing gum?</i>
- Yes.


421
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.470
I did an ad for chewing gum.
It must be why.


422
00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:51.996
<i>I told you not to do it.
They're using you!</i>


423
00:47:52.021 --> 00:47:52.621
Michel...

424
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.190
<i>Forget it.</i>

425
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:57.834
<i>There was no answering machine.</i>

426
00:47:58.369 --> 00:47:58.919
No.

427
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.030
All I want is peace.

428
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.185
A life of peace and quiet.

429
00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.610
<i>Life won't be peaceful with me.
You've chosen badly.</i>


430
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:12.870
<i>Did you meet someone?</i>

431
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.630
No. I'm waiting for you.

432
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.590
<i>Why didn't you answer before?</i>

433
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:21.430
I told you - I was at the door,
but I couldn't get inside.


434
00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:22.710
<i>I understand.</i>

435
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:26.830
How are you?

436
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:29.030
<i>I'm going to Hungary next week.</i>

437
00:48:30.206 --> 00:48:31.566
<i>And what do you do?</i>

438
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.870
I'm going to bed.

439
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.950
<i>Go ahead!</i>

440
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.070
<i>Go on!</i>

441
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:39.990
Are you there?

442
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:42.950
Michel, are you there?

443
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:50.062
All over again...

444
00:49:12.075 --> 00:49:12.625
Hello.

445
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:13.790
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

446
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:15.510
No, I'm not.

447
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:16.990
<i>Get into bed.</i>

448
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.110
<i>Are you in bed?</i>

449
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.550
I'm taking a shower.
I was getting undressed.


450
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.230
<i>No one is helping you?</i>

451
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:30.190
<i>Valentine. Are you there?</i>

452
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:32.110
No. Goodnight.

453
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:48.432
I knew you'd make it. Well done.

454
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:51.110
Did they ask the question?

455
00:49:51.195 --> 00:49:54.589
From the book you dropped in the street?
The one you told me about...


456
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.830
You don't like it?

457
00:50:27.735 --> 00:50:29.637
Thank you very much.

458
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:34.013
I wonder... What'll will be the
first verdict I'll sign it with...


459
00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:01.790
Civil procedure.

460
00:51:02.646 --> 00:51:06.455
The inhabitants of the muncipality
of Pinchat - versus Joseph Kern.

Please enter.

462
00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:12.650
Hello. I would like number 432;
Van den Budenmayer.


463
00:52:13.072 --> 00:52:15.275
<i>- Did I pronounce it right?</i>
- Yes, that's correct.


464
00:52:16.652 --> 00:52:17.772
This one?

465
00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:19.619
Yes.

466
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.190
I just sold the last one.

467
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:27.709
I'll have others this afternoon.
I can set one aside, if you want it.


468
00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:39.670
Whose paper is this?

469
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.030
Yours.

470
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:55.450
<i>"Scandal in the district of Pinchat"...</i>

-"Listening to neighbors' phone conversations for years."</i>


472
00:53:12.497 --> 00:53:13.497
Good afternoon.

473
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:14.590
I came...

474
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:17.870
I saw the newspaper...

475
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:20.205
I want you to know
I didn't tell a soul.


476
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:21.590
I know.

477
00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:25.298
No one. Not the police. No one.

478
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:26.630
<i>I know.</i>

479
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:31.270
<i>I know who it was.</i>

480
00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:33.870
Who?

481
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:36.350
It was me.

482
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:39.910
<i>You asked me to.</i>

483
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.270
<i>Won't you come in?</i>

484
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:45.630
Let me show you something.

485
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:08.110
<i>
- One, two, three, four, five, six.</i>

486
00:54:09.088 --> 00:54:09.808
<i>Seven?</i>

487
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:11.830
<i>
- Seven.</i>

488
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:16.108
<i>Won't you have some pear brandy?</i>

489
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:27.150
I've had it for ages,
but I've never had an occasion.


490
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:43.510
To my health.

491
00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:51.310
Why did you do it?

492
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:53.830
Why I turned myself in?

493
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.110
Yes.

494
00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:01.078
<i>I wanted to see your reaction
once you saw it in your paper.</i>


495
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:04.110
You suspected I'd come?

496
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:07.030
After our last conversation,
I thought so.


497
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:09.830
Why?

498
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:19.805
Do you expect something from me?

499
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:20.870
Yes.

500
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:27.500
The other day, before you left,
you mentioned pity.


501
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.348
Afterwards, I realized
it was disgust.


502
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:44.830
Will you sit down for a moment?

503
00:55:53.584 --> 00:55:55.288
Will you smile for me?

504
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:05.110
The day you left, you cried.

505
00:56:05.626 --> 00:56:06.666
I cried.

506
00:56:10.147 --> 00:56:12.067
And I shut off my radio.

507
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.830
<i>I sat down at my desk.</i>

508
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:20.670
<i>The fountain pen I'd used
all my life was out of ink,</i>


509
00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:22.390
<i>so I took a pencil...</i>

510
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.910
and wrote letters to my
neighbours and to the police.


511
00:56:27.329 --> 00:56:29.216
I mailed them that evening.

512
00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:31.510
While you were sleeping soundly.

513
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:33.670
I wasn't sleeping.

514
00:56:35.503 --> 00:56:37.627
- I went bowling.
- Bowling?


515
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:41.885
Do you remember the
conversation of that couple?


516
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:43.470
The boy and the girl?

517
00:56:45.587 --> 00:56:46.867
I remember.

518
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:48.925
They wanted to go too.

519
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:50.430
That same evening.

520
00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.630
Maybe you were right next to them.

521
00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.510
Maybe.

522
00:57:00.588 --> 00:57:02.148
You didn't like her.

523
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.322
It’s almost over.
I was right.


524
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.860
You seem happy about it.

525
00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.140
Did you provoke it?

526
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.580
Yes or no?

527
00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.657
Because of my eavesdropping
and informing thereof,


528
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.660
the woman has met another man.

529
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.420
Good day.

530
00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.780
Since then, she's been alone.

531
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.860
I asked my brother
to go see her.


532
00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.380
He stayed three days.

533
00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.220
<i>In one week
I'm going to England indefinitely.</i>


534
00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.555
<i>I'm abandoning them,
him and my mother.</i>


535
00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.820
<i>Every day he gets a little worse.</i>

536
00:58:34.403 --> 00:58:36.002
<i>I shouldn't leave.</i>

537
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.940
Leave. It’s your destiny.

538
00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.580
You can't live your
brother's life for him.


539
00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:49.740
I love him.

540
00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:53.860
If only I could help.

541
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.620
You can.

542
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.100
Be.

543
00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.660
What do you mean?

544
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.980
That's all: Be.

545
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.620
- Do you like flying?
- No.


546
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.420
Then take the ferry.

547
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.700
I've never taken one.

548
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.420
It's less expensive and healthier.

549
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:18.980
That's a good idea.

550
00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.500
<i>Do you like it?</i>

551
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.740
<i>Today is my birthday.</i>

552
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:34.380
I didn't know.

553
00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:41.580
35 years ago today,
at about the same time, 5 o'clock,


554
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.620
I acquitted a man. A sailor.

555
00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:50.420
One of my first big cases.
It was a tough time in my life.


556
00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.940
I have since realized,
I made a mistake.


557
00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.100
He was guilty.

558
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.740
I'm all out of bulbs.

559
01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.180
What happened to him?

560
01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.100
<i>I did my own investigation.</i>

561
01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.568
<i>He's married, with three children.</i>

562
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.300
<i>And recently, a grandson.</i>

563
01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.860
<i>He lives in peace.</i>

564
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.620
<i>So you did what you had to.</i>

565
01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.860
<i>You even did well.</i>

566
01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.420
Don't you understand?

567
01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.780
<i>You saved him.</i>

568
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:10.580
Perhaps.

569
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.912
But how many others
have I have acquitted...


570
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:15.430
guilty ones?

571
01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:21.260
Deciding what is true and
what isn't, now seems to me...


572
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.380
a lack of modesty.

573
01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.460
Of vanity?

574
01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.380
Of vanity.

575
01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.660
Could I have a drop?

576
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.940
To you!

577
01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.100
If I had to go to court...

578
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.180
-Are there still judges like you?

579
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.060
You won't go to court.

580
01:02:07.053 --> 01:02:09.084
Justice doesn't deal
with the innocent.


581
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.780
See that?

582
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.460
It's the sixth window
they've broken.


583
01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.641
Even though they've changed
the wavelength,


584
01:02:18.666 --> 01:02:20.880
and I no longer can eavesdrop
on their conversations.


585
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.380
Where is the broom?

586
01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.460
In the kitchen closet.

587
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.540
Put the stone on the piano.

588
01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.980
You're not afraid?

589
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.260
<i>I wonder what I would
do in their place.</i>


590
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.460
<i>The same thing.</i>

591
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.660
Would you throw stones?

592
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.959
<i>In their place?
-Of course.</i>


593
01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.140
And that goes for
the one's I judged too.

594
01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.180
Given their lives and
situations, I would steal,


595
01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.140
I would kill, I would lie.
-Of course I would.


596
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.180
But I wasn't in their shoes 
- I was in mine.

597
01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.420
Is there someone you love?

598
01:03:50.557 --> 01:03:51.207
No.

599
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.620
<i>Have you ever loved?</i>

600
01:04:02.917 --> 01:04:04.357
Yesterday I dreamt...

601
01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.660
I dreamt of you.

602
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.540
You were 40 or 50 years old,

603
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.140
and you were happy.

604
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.300
Do your dreams come true?

605
01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.180
It's been years since I
dreamt something nice.


606
01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.180
Stay here!

607
01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.180
I bought a ticket
for the ferry.


608
01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.916
I arrive in England
next Wednesday.


609
01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.140
At 7:30 a.m.

610
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.660
<i>Why the ferry?</i>

611
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.540
So I can visit my
mother near Calais.


612
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.340
<i>I’ll meet you at 8:00.</i>

613
01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.860
<i>I'm happy you're coming.</i>

614
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.780
Michel, tell me...

615
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.060
Do you love me?

616
01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.380
<i>I think so.</i>

617
01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.580
You love me or you think so?

618
01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.180
<i>It’s the same thing.</i>

619
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.340
The battery...

620
01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.860
Auguste!

621
01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.460
<i>Personal weather reports, may I help you?</i>

622
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:37.100
I've tried calling
for a few days.


623
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.820
<i>I was sick. 
I'm sorry.</i>

624
01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.260
What will the weather be
on the English Channel next week?


625
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.820
<i>Wonderful. Sunny, a slight breeze,
chilly in the morning.</i>


626
01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.340
Why are you laughing?

627
01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.380
<i>I intend to go there.
Or even farther.</i>


628
01:11:50.405 --> 01:11:51.565
For your work?

629
01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:54.245
<i>No, for pleasure. 
On a yacht.</i>

630
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:55.860
A nice cruiser?

631
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.260
<i>Yes, very beautiful.</i>

632
01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:58.580
Will you be closing?

633
01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.140
<i>I'll have to.</i>

634
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.580
That's too bad.
This line was a good idea. Goodbye.


635
01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.540
<i>We told you not to smile!</i>

636
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.820
<i>Be serious!</i>

637
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.380
Excuse me. Can you send an
invitation to this address?


638
01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.780
Just one person?

639
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.180
Are you okay?

640
01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.860
- So long.
- Have a good time.


641
01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.770
So long.

642
01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.335
Does anyone have make-up remover?

643
01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:48.469
Here.

644
01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.860
<i>Everyone noticed
that guy.</i>


645
01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.980
<i>During the entire show
I kept staring at him.</i>


646
01:16:11.436 --> 01:16:13.503
Good night, Valentine. Goodbye.

647
01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.540
You came.

648
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.740
You knew the invitation
came from me?


649
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.140
I'd hoped so.

650
01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.620
Did you look for me?

651
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.100
During the entire show.

652
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.660
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I wanted to say goodbye.


653
01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:49.980
Goodbye.

654
01:16:52.585 --> 01:16:57.025
I'd like you to tell me about
that dream you had. In detail.


655
01:16:59.677 --> 01:17:01.397
You were 50 years old,

656
01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.900
<i>and you were happy.</i>

657
01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.580
In this dream...

658
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.300
was there someone else?

659
01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.500
<i>There was.</i>

660
01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.300
Who?

661
01:17:19.555 --> 01:17:21.035
You woke up

662
01:17:21.693 --> 01:17:23.973
and you smiled at someone
next to you.


663
01:17:24.634 --> 01:17:25.954
I don't know who.

664
01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.783
That's what will happen?

665
01:17:30.941 --> 01:17:32.341
In 20 or 25 years?

666
01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.420
Yes.

667
01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.740
What else do you know?

668
01:17:44.202 --> 01:17:45.077
Who are you?

669
01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.860
A retired judge.

670
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.860
I feel something important
is happening around me.


671
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.101
And it scares me.

672
01:18:06.171 --> 01:18:07.331
Is that better?

673
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.100
I used to come to this theatre often.

674
01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.580
Where did you usually sit?

675
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.260
Where I sat today.

676
01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.860
That's why you couldn't see me.

677
01:18:28.227 --> 01:18:30.307
One day,
during the intermission,


678
01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.780
the elastic holding my books broke.

679
01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:39.060
One of them, a big
one, fell down...


680
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.460
somewhere around here.

681
01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:47.153
It was just before my exams.
I ran down immediately.


682
01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.740
The book had opened to a certain
page. I read a few sentences.


683
01:18:51.354 --> 01:18:54.185
And that was the questions
they asked me during my exam.


684
01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:57.580
Getting out of the house
did you good.


685
01:18:59.328 --> 01:19:00.928
I had to recharge the battery.

686
01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:02.980
It was dead.

687
01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.620
The storm.

688
01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.980
Lousy coffee.

689
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.580
I was wondering...

690
01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:43.260
-why you mentioned that sailor.

691
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.740
Do you know why?

692
01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.020
Yes.

693
01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:59.420
Because...

694
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:04.500
-there was something more important,
you didn't want to tell me.


695
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:11.340
About the woman that you loved.

696
01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:16.841
She betrayed you.

697
01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:22.420
She betrayed you,

698
01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:25.900
and you never understood why.

699
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.460
And you kept on loving her.

700
01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:35.860
How do you know all this?

701
01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.340
It wasn't hard to guess.

702
01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.300
What was she like?

703
01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.740
She graduated two
years before me.


704
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.940
She was blond.

705
01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:00.140
Delicate.

706
01:21:01.053 --> 01:21:04.323
Radiant.
-And with a long neck.


707
01:21:07.143 --> 01:21:11.544
Her clothing was light-colored.
Her furniture too.


708
01:21:11.768 --> 01:21:15.448
In the foyer there was a mirror,
with a white frame.


709
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.460
It was in that mirror,

710
01:21:19.782 --> 01:21:21.342
one night,

711
01:21:22.261 --> 01:21:24.772
that I saw her white legs spread...

712
01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.900
-With a man between them.

713
01:21:33.262 --> 01:21:34.302
Why...

714
01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.020
did that happen?

715
01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.020
Do you know?

716
01:21:39.423 --> 01:21:43.423
This man,
whose name was Hugo Holbling...


717
01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.460
-could offer her what she wanted.

718
01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.340
They left.

719
01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:57.420
I followed them.

720
01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:01.420
I crossed France, the Channel...

721
01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:04.940
I was...

722
01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:07.060
humiliated.

723
01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.220
Until the day she died
in an accident.


724
01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.780
Since then,
I've never loved another woman.


725
01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:20.020
Yes.

726
01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:22.380
I stopped believing.

727
01:22:24.448 --> 01:22:26.688
Or maybe, I have never found the woman...

728
01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:33.580
Maybe you're the
woman I never met.


729
01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.340
The story doesn't end there.

730
01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.980
No.

731
01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.420
A while ago,

732
01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.780
I was given a difficult case.

733
01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.635
On it was written the name
of the defendant:


734
01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.180
Hugo Holbling.

735
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.740
- The same man.
- Yes.


736
01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.100
He'd come back here.

737
01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.460
I'm closing up.

738
01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.765
Did you see a woman
with a bucket?


739
01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.660
The storm flooded the wardrobe.

740
01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.132
If you see her,

741
01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:14.700
tell her I'm upstairs.

742
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:22.900
You shouldn't have taken the case.

743
01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.660
I didn't want to.

744
01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.454
At first I wanted to kill him.

745
01:23:33.025 --> 01:23:36.663
I would have,
if it would have changed something.


746
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:39.980
Now,

747
01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.780
he was waiting for my verdict.

748
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:48.420
He was building a covered
market - which caved in.


749
01:23:48.445 --> 01:23:50.365
Several people died.

750
01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:54.780
I said he was guilty.

751
01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.140
It was a legal sentence.

752
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.260
Afterwards, I asked for early retirement.

753
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.500
<i>Did you see her?</i>

754
01:24:11.033 --> 01:24:11.783
No.

755
01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.260
I'm always running after her!

756
01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:19.300
<i>Milana!</i>

757
01:24:21.892 --> 01:24:23.042
<i>Milana?!</i>

758
01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:31.620
<i>Ah, there you are! Give me the buckets.
They're heavy.</i>


759
01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.860
You seemed to like
my pear brandy.


760
01:24:41.885 --> 01:24:44.929
Thank you.
I have another favor to ask you.


761
01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.420
I'll be gone two or three weeks.

762
01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:49.851
I’ll come see you afterwards.

763
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:53.810
Please give me
one of the puppies.


764
01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.860
Will the fashion show be on TV?

765
01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:00.980
Probably.

766
01:25:01.303 --> 01:25:03.463
I better buy a TV.

767
01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:05.860
I have one I never use.

768
01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:08.897
My brother can bring it to you.
His name is Marc.


769
01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:11.940
I'd like to meet him.
I’ll see you soon.


770
01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.340
Be seeing you.

771
01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.460
<i>Do you have your ticket?</i>

772
01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.020
Where do I go?

773
01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.020
This deck. That corridor.

774
01:26:50.218 --> 01:26:50.968
Welcome.

775
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.395
Excuse me, I'm lost. F38?

776
01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.461
The deck above.

777
01:27:08.061 --> 01:27:08.911
<i>Welcome!</i>
