我们说到哪了
Where were we?


10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.230
对了  想起来了
Oh, yeah, that's right. Now I remember.

"女巫二三事"
"A note about witches."


13
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.870
关于女巫你们得知道
See, here's the thing about them.


14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.510
她们是真的
They're real!

总监     布塔

16
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.980
女巫千真万确存在
Witches are as real as a rock in your shoe.


17
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.510
这是第一件事
That's the first thing you need to know.


18
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.250
你们得知道的第二件事就是
The second thing you need to know,


19
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.170
她们就在这里
they're here!


20
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.070
隐匿于我们当中
And they live amongst us...


21
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.290
和人类共同生活
side by side, with humans.


22
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.260
不论是大城市  还是小乡镇
In every big city, in every small town.


23
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.170
谁知道呢
For all you know,


24
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.450
说不定你家隔壁就住着女巫
a witch might be living right next door to you right now.


25
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.020
她们无处不在
They everywhere!


26
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.150
护士可能是女巫
A witch might be a nurse,


27
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.930
老师也可能是
or your teacher,


28
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.120
你最好相信我说的
and you can bet your sweet patootie


29
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.780
公车上那个送你美味的盐水太妃糖的
that friendly, little old lady on the bus offering you


30
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.640
看似友善的小老太婆
a delicious piece of salt water taffy


31
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.890
也是个女巫
is a witch.


32
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.160
而最重要的一点
And here's the most important thing.


33
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.670
最重要的一点是
The most important thing.


34
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.720
女巫对小孩恨之入骨
Witches hate children!


35
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.080
女巫每时每刻
A witch spends all her time


36
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.860
都在思考消灭小孩的法子
thinking up ways to destroy children.


37
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.660
她满脑子就只有这一件事
That's all she thinks about.


38
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.330
"我该怎么压扁这个可恶的小孩"
"How will I squish this horrible child?"


39
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.630
女巫从压扁小孩当中获得的乐趣
A witch gets the same pleasure from squishing a child


40
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.130
正如你们吃冰淇淋所获得的欢乐一样
as you get from eating a bowl of ice cream


41
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.030
冰淇淋上洒满奶油糖浆
covered in butterscotch syrup,


42
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.690
再加点奶油
with whipped cream,


43
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.070
坚果碎
chopped nuts,


44
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.140
顶上再放颗樱桃
and a cherry on top.


45
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.790
我的故事始于1968年的最后一个月
My story begins during the last month of 1968.


46
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.430
相信吗  我曾经是个小男孩
Believe it or not, I was once a young boy.


47
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.290
有爸爸妈妈的小男孩
A boy with a mother and a father.


48
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.500
我们那时住在芝加哥
We lived in Chicago.


49
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.680
圣诞时分经常下雪
And it snows a lot at Christmas time.


50
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.990
雪最令人头疼的一点就是  它很滑
Tricky thing with snow is, it's slippery.


51
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.370
-去前面  这边  -妈妈
- Take the front! This way! - Mom?


52
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.710
-我系了安全带  -爸爸
- I was wearing my seat belt. - Dad?


53
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.450
妈妈
Mom!


54
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.020
可我爸妈没系
Mama and Daddy weren't.


55
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.570
妈妈  爸爸
Mama! Dad!


56
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.240
妈妈  爸爸
Mommy! Dad!


57
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.480
我们救你出来
Let's get you out of here.


58
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.230
在我八岁的圣诞节
It was during my eighth Christmas


59
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.840
我失去了父母
that I lost my mother and father.


60
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.110
我的乖孩子
My dear child...


61
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.780
外婆
Grandma.


62
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.620
外婆来了
Grandma's here.


63
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.420
你会没事的
You gonna be all right.


64
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.120
来  让我看看你
Here, let me look at you.


65
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.240
我带你走吧
I'mma get you out of here.


66
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.760
你的东西都收拾好了  我带你回家
I packed your things, I'm gonna take you home.


67
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.540
回家  回我家吗
Home? To my house?


68
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.540
不  亲爱的
No, darling.


69
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.690
回外婆家
Home to my house.


70
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.390
需要我帮你把东西拎进去吗  姐妹
Need any help bringing these bags inside, sister?


71
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.080
谢谢  不用了  雷吉纳德
Oh, no, thank you, Reginald.


72
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.680
你帮的忙够多了
You've done enough already.


73
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.330
在车站遇见你一定是天意
Running into you at the bus station was a godsend.


74
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.610
我十分感激
I'm much obliged.


75
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.760
乐意效劳
My pleasure.


76
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.010
周日教堂见吗
I'll see you in church come Sunday?


77
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.760
那是当然
Oh, you know you will.


78
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.320
很高兴认识你  年轻人
Pleasure to make your acquaintance, young man.


79
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.940
欢迎来到迪莫波利斯
Welcome to Demopolis.


80
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.020
-谢谢  雷吉  -回见
- Thank you, Reggie. - Sister.


81
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.620
等等
Wait.


82
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.230
别穿着脏鞋踩我的地毯
Take them shoes off before you walk on my good rug.


83
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.180
外婆是我妈妈的妈妈
Grandma was my mama's mama.


84
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.610
她虽强势  但心地善良
A tough lady with a big heart.


85
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.720
要是你犯了错
The kind that wouldn't hesitate


86
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.670
她会毫不手软地打你一顿
to give a spanking if you deserve it


87
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.810
但当你需要拥抱时  她也毫不吝啬
or a big ol' hug if you needed it.


88
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.040
我想着
I reckon...


89
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.850
你住这里正合适
you'll be comfy here.


90
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.140
这原来是你妈妈的房间
In your mama's old room.


91
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.010
我们明天再好好安顿
We'll get you situated tomorrow.


92
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.820
我去做点热巧克力
I'm gonna make some hot chocolate.


93
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.570
想喝吗
Want some?


94
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.420
我还是做点吧
I'm gonna make some anyway,


95
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.470
以防你改变主意
in case you change your mind.


96
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.520
明日最高气温23摄氏度
High tomorrow, 73.


97
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.740
小家伙  你这是干嘛
Young man, what is wrong with you?


98
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.750
怎么一个人孤零零坐在这里  外面天气多好呀
Sitting in here all by your lonesome. It's nice out.


99
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.040
想吃点东西吗
You want something to eat?


100
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.190
我刚炸好鸡翅
I just fried some wings.


101
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.860
没人能拒绝我的鸡翅  我给你端一盘来
Nobody turns down my wings. I'm gonna make you a plate.

111
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.270
你还等什么呢
What you waiting for?


112
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.340
没什么胃口
Don't feel like eating.


113
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.390
我还不想浪费这好好的粮食呢
And I don't feel like wasting all this good food.


114
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.390
怎么  你觉得我应该可怜你吗
What, you think I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?


115
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.700
我一点也不
Well, I don't.


116
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.420
我难过吗  当然
Do I feel bad? Yeah.


117
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.930
但我不可怜你
But not sorry.


118
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.560
有时  上帝会以我们想不到的方式
Sometimes, whatever the good Lord needs to teach us


119
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.210
指引我们
comes in ways we don't see.


120
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.390
但这不意味着我们不能从中学到些什么
But it doesn't mean we're not supposed to learn something.


121
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.860
你看
Look here.


122
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.920
她是我的宝贝女儿
This was my baby.


123
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.180
只要能让她复活  我愿意付出一切代价
I'd do anything for her to be here right now.


124
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.700
但上帝对她另有安排
But the Man Above had another plan for her.


125
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.100
而对我来讲公平与否  并不重要
And whether it seems fair to me or not, it doesn't matter.


126
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.430
生活有时就是这么不公
Sometimes life isn't fair.


127
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.310
人人都迟早要面对这艰难的一课
It's a hard lesson for folks to learn


128
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.960
大多数人不用在如此年轻时面对
and most people don't have to learn it this young.


129
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.700
但你得面对
But you do.


130
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.540
懂了吗
You hear me?


131
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.960
拜托  宝贝  你得吃点东西
Come on now, baby, you got to eat something.


132
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.350
你喜欢蛋糕吗
You like cake?


133
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.560
玉米面包和蛋糕差不多
Well, corn bread is basically cake.


134
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.870
尝尝吧
Go on. Try it.


135
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.580
他叫什么
What's his name?


136
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.520
是她
It's a she.


137
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.230
她的名字就由你来取吧
Her name is something you can ponder.


138
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.370
你给你的小老鼠取好名字了吗
Have you come up with a name for your mouse yet?


139
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.590
快告诉我啊
Well, tell me.


140
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.640
别吊我的胃口
Don't be keeping me in suspense.


141
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.410
艾西
Aisy.


142
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.630
懒懒
Lazy?


143
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.130
那老鼠明明浑身都是劲
Well, that mouse is full of nothing but energy.


144
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.140
无休无止地在轮子里跑
She runs all the time in that wheel.


145
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.720
不是"懒懒"
Not "lazy."


146
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.250
是黛西
Daisy.


147
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.350
"黛西"啊
"Daisy." Oh.


148
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.620
我喜欢这名字
I like it.


149
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.010
再适合她不过了
That's a perfect name for her.


150
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.030
闭上眼睛  宝贝
Close your eyes, honey.


151
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.070
不知怎的  她做到了
And somehow, she did it.


152
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.010
一点一滴地
Little by little,


153
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.940
这扯扯  那拽拽
with a tug here and a pull there,


154
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.430
她带我走出了阴霾
she brought me out of my sadness.


155
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.640
尽管我的阴霾已被驱散
But even though my own darkness was being lifted,


156
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.340
可附近还有另一个黑影逼近
there was another dark shadow looming nearby.


157
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.220
非常近
Very nearby.


158
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.540
我当时还没意识到
I didn't know it,


159
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.200
但我即将第一次见到女巫
but I was about to meet my first witch.


160
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.570
真该死
Curses.


161
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.440
雷蒙德
Raymond.


162
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.250
雷蒙德
Raymond.


163
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.000
这能叫新鲜吗
You call these fresh?


164
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.650
-可我们才进的货  -什么时候  去年吗
- But we just got them in. - When? Last year?


165
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.430
你看这叶子都发黄了
Look at how yellow they are.


166
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.570
边上还有小黑点
And those brown spots around the edges.


167
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.280
我才不要把上好的肉汁浪费在
I'm not gonna waste good bacon drippings


168
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.270
这些蔫了的菜叶上
on these shriveled-up weeds.


169
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.460
你能给我拿点新鲜甘蓝来吗
Can you get me some fresh greens if you don't mind?


170
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.420
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.


171
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.660
我去看看库房里有没有
I'll see what we have in the back.


172
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.700
赶紧去吧
You do that.


173
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.950
外婆  我能买这盒钉子给黛西做个房子吗
Grandma, can I get these nails to make Daisy a house?


174
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.790
这种没镀锌
Well, these aren't galvanized.


175
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.550
得用镀锌的钉子才不会生锈
You have to use galvanized nails so they won't rust.


176
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.930
-可是镀锌的要多花三毛五  -安全第一
- But galvanized costs 35 cents more. - Safety first.


177
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.180
好的  外婆
Yes, ma'am.


178
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.690
要是被生锈的钉子划伤  你可能会得破伤风
You cut yourself on a rusty nail, you can get lockjaw.


179
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.750
-好的  外婆  -那我就得帮你治病了
- Yes, ma'am. - And then I'd have to flush out your system


180
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.390
要用上橄榄油  大蒜汁和塔巴斯科辣椒酱
with liver oil, garlic juice, Tabasco sauce.


181
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.060
你可不想尝试那些吧
You wouldn't want to go through that now, would you?


182
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:52.990
不想  外婆
No, ma'am.


183
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.190
很好  记住  安全第一
Good. Remember, safety first.


184
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.920
外婆知道如何治疗各种病痛
Grandma knew how to fix all kinds of ailments.


185
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.370
她跟她的外婆学会了使用草药和药水
She learned from her grandma how to use herbs and potions


186
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.440
还有奇怪的咒语
and strange incantations


187
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.900
能让病人焕然一新
to make sick people good as new.


188
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.510
外婆是土生土长的阿拉巴马州人
Here in Alabama, where she grew up,


189
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.110
她在本地是个出名的疗愈师
Grandma was known as a healer.


190
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.560
镀锌的
Galvanized.


191
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800
小子
Boy.


192
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.950
小子
Boy.


193
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:32.080
你喜欢糖果吗
Do you like sweets?


194
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.000
她很温顺的
She is tame.


195
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.970
很乖的
Very sweet.


196
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:56.530
亲亲她
Give her a kiss.


197
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.320
小伙子
Young man.


198
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.380
你要想买钉子就赶紧...
You want those nails, you better come on...


199
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.480
很好  雷蒙德  这才像话
Yes, Raymond, that's more like it.


200
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.960
-外婆  我得告诉你一件事  -现在不行  孩子
- Grandma, I need to tell you something! - Not now, son.


201
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.100
可是  外婆...
But, Grandma...


202
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.440
你不是想买钉子吗
I thought you wanted those nails.


203
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.080
别管钉子了  我们走吧
Forget it. Let's just go.


204
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.510
嗯
Yeah.


205
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.520
咱们走吧
Let's just go.


206
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.460
孩子
Son,


207
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.390
今天上午在杂货店
what were you trying to tell me


208
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.480
你想跟我说什么来着
in the grocery store this morning?


209
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.520
你当时抖得像筛糠一样
You were shaking like a leaf.


210
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.600
没事了  外婆
Don't worry about that, Grandma.


211
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.960
-我只希望你能好起来  -我挺好的
- I just want you to feel better. - I feel fine.


212
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.680
告诉我你早上想说什么吧
You just tell me what you were trying to say.


213
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.920
当时感觉你都快抓狂了
Looked like you were about to have a conniption fit.


214
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.230
我不确定我看到了什么
I don't know what I saw.


215
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.030
有个很吓人的女士
It was a scary lady.


216
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.700
她叫住了我
She called to me.


217
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.290
可是她叫我和说话的时候
But when she did, when she talked,


218
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.360
她的嘴...
her mouth...


219
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.860
她是不是戴着手套
Was she wearing gloves?


220
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.640
长长的手套  一直戴到手肘
Long ones, up to her elbows?


221
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.930
她是不是戴着帽子
Was she wearing a hat?


222
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.240
她头上像是裹着毛巾之类的东西
It looked like she had a towel on her head or something.


223
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.910
她说话的时候
And when she talked,


224
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.570
声音是不是难听又嘶哑
did her voice sound ugly and scratchy


225
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.460
就像生锈的门在嘎吱作响
like an outhouse door swinging on a rusty hinge?


226
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.970
真是怕什么来什么
I feared this was happening.


227
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.130
你在杂货店看到的女士不是什么女士
That lady you saw in the grocery store was no lady.


228
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.350
你看到的
What you saw


229
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.340
是个女巫
was a witch.


230
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.040
女巫
A witch?


231
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.830
没错
That's right.


232
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.680
一个一无是处  肮脏卑鄙  阴险鬼祟的女巫
A no-good, rotten, low-down, sneaky, sneaky witch.


233
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.880
慢点  慢点
Okay. Okay.


234
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.840
你是不是和教会的朋友联合起来开我的玩笑
Is this you and your church friends trying to play a joke on me?


235
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.710
如果是的话  真不怎么好笑
'Cause if it is, it's not very funny.


236
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:57.780
听好了  孩子
Listen, child.


237
00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.960
女巫可不是拿来开玩笑的
Witches ain't nothing to joke about.


238
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.150
我知道一些孩子现在已经不再是孩子了
I've known children who no longer exist as children on this earth.


239
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.670
他们被转化了
They were turned,


240
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.290
变形了
transformed,


241
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.580
被女巫带走了
taken by witches.


242
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.150
我可以给你讲讲爱丽丝·布鲁的事
I can tell you about Alice Blue.


243
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.340
爱丽丝·布鲁当年是我最好的朋友
Well, Alice Blue and I were best friends.


244
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.340
我们两家之间只隔一条街
We lived across the street from each other.


245
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.770
我们就像姐妹  密不可分
We were like sisters. Inseparable.


246
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.630
我们干什么都在一起  哪怕是家务活
We did everything together, even our chores.


247
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.300
但爱丽丝是个很磨蹭的人
But Alice was a lollygagger.


248
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.490
爱丽丝  别磨磨蹭蹭的了
Alice, quit lollygagging, girl.


249
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.250
快到晚饭时间了
It's almost suppertime.


250
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.810
爱丽丝做了一件小孩子绝不该做的事
Alice did something no child should ever do.


251
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.710
她收下了一个陌生人给的糖果
She took candy from a stranger.


252
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.160
我吓坏了  我像脚底抹了油一般逃了
I got so scared, I tore out of there like greased lightning,


253
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.080
径直跑回了家
and hightailed it straight home.


254
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.350
我真不该撇下爱丽丝
I never should have left Alice alone.


255
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.870
我知道我不该那样
I knew I shouldn't have.


256
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.060
可我太害怕了
But I was so scared.


257
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.120
到了晚上
Later that night,


258
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.010
当我见到爱丽丝还活着时
when I saw Alice alive,


259
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.010
我高兴得就像找到了一整桶奶酪的小老鼠
I was as happy as a mouse in a bucket of cheese.


260
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.540
但第二天一早
But the very next morning,


261
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.800
高兴的心情都消失了  因为那件事发生了
all that happiness went away because it happened.


262
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.180
她开始转化了
She started turning.


263
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.720
爱丽丝变鸡了  变成了鸡
Alice was chicken-afied. Chicken-alified.


264
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.930
我的天
Lordy!


265
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.170
这鸡可真大
Look at the size of that chicken.


266
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.450
你看到爱丽丝跑哪去了吗
Y'all seen where Alice run off to?


267
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.350
她就在...
She's right...


268
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.250
你眼前
there.


269
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.140
你说什么呢  孩子
What you talking about, child?


270
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.530
她去哪了
Where'd she go?


271
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.360
我努力解释我看到的事
I tried to explain what I saw,


272
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.670
但人人都像看疯子一样看着我
but everybody was looking at me like I was crazy.


273
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.480
最终  我闭上了嘴
Finally, I just shut up about it.


274
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.080
不过  我争取每天都去鸡圈看看她
Although, I made it a point to visit Alice in her coop every day.


275
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.600
你好  爱丽丝
Hi, Alice.


276
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.080
爱丽丝甚至会下蛋
Alice even laid eggs.


277
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.800
绿色的大鸡蛋
Big green ones.


278
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.610
是我见过最大的蛋
Biggest green eggs I ever seen.


279
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.720
大家说她的蛋很好吃
People said they were delicious.


280
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.720
那女巫呢
What about the witch?


281
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.800
女巫怎么了
What about her?


282
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.910
她离开了吗
Did she go away?


283
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.460
天啊  没有
Oh, my, no.


284
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.680
女巫一旦进入你的生活  就永远...
Once a witch come into your life, it never...


285
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.260
永远不会...
Never...


286
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.140
天啊  我的上帝
Oh, my, Lord in Heaven.


287
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.800
我在想什么呢
What am I thinking?


288
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.030
我刚说了我们今天遇到了一个女巫
I just told you we saw a witch today.


289
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.770
有个女巫在杂货店
A witch in the grocery store.


290
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.870
而我在做什么  坐在这里
And what am I doing? Sitting here


291
00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.480
就像瞎了一只眼  另一只眼也跟着不好使了一样
like I'm blind in one eye and can't see out the other,


292
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.830
浪费宝贵的时间磨磨蹭蹭
wasting precious time lollygagging.


293
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.470
我一直好奇外婆在那个上锁的储藏室里藏了什么
Always wondered what Grandma kept in that locked closet.


294
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.420
结果发现里面全是医用草药和药剂
Turns out it was full of medicinal herbs and elixirs,


295
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.930
还有关于古老疗愈法的书
and old books about ancient healing.


296
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.200
我妈妈总说
Now, my mom always said


297
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.220
外婆算是那种乡下的赤脚大仙
Grandma was sort of a country-type healer.


298
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.400
但我现在开始觉得
But now I was starting to think


299
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.580
她可能是伏都教女祭司
she might be a voodoo priestess.


300
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.670
孩子  我们得走了
Child, we need to leave.


301
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.040
-走  -没错  离开
- Leave? - That's right, leave.


302
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.020
我们在这里不安全
It's not safe for us here.


303
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.290
可我们要去哪
But where we gonna go?


304
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.070
我要联系我的表亲  埃斯顿
I'll call my cousin, Eston.


305
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.030
让他给我们
Have him make a reservation for us


306
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.440
在奥尔良帝国岛大酒店订一间房
at the Grand Orleans Imperial Island Hotel.


307
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.580
他在那当了三十多年的厨师长
He was the executive chef there for over 30 years.


308
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.870
他有影响力
He's got pull there.


309
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.270
他是个明星
He's a star.


310
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.230
他做的菜让那家酒店成了知名地标
His cooking put that hotel on the map.


311
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.220
成了全阿拉巴马州最奢华时髦的度假胜地
It's the swankiest resort in all of Alabama.


312
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.730
以后你会跟自己的孙子们讲起在酒店的经历
You'll be telling your grandkids about your stay in this hotel.


313
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.440
你怎么知道我们在那里就安全
How do you know we'll be safe there?


314
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.350
因为啊  孩子
Because, child,


315
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.850
只有富裕的白人
ain't nothing but rich white folks


316
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.220
才会去住奥尔良帝国岛大酒店
at the Grand Orleans Imperial Island Hotel.


317
00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.670
而女巫只会捕猎穷人
And witches only prey on the poor,


318
00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.220
那些被社会忽视的人
the overlooked,


319
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.190
那些她们认为即使失踪也不会有人在意的孩子们
the kids they think nobody's gonna make a fuss about if they go missing.


320
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.410
快去收拾行李
Go pack!


321
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.430
外婆  每个城市都有女巫吗
Grandma, are there witches in every city?


322
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.960
每个城市  每个州  每个国家
Every city, every state, every country.


323
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.600
每个国家都有一个秘密的女巫组织
And there's a secret society of witches in every country


324
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.800
叫做女巫团
called a coven.


325
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.200
就像女巫版的扶轮社
That's just like a Rotary Club but for witches.


326
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.600
她们会聚集在一起
They all get together in one place


327
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.600
闲聊她们对谁施了咒
and gossip about who they put spells on,


328
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.110
或是交换药水秘方之类的
or trade potion secrets, and whatnot.


329
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.400
但最重要的是
But most important,


330
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.450
她们从高阶女巫那里接收指令
they receive orders from the Grand High Witch.


331
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.850
高阶女巫
The Grand High Witch?


332
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.100
是的  高阶女巫
The Grand High Witch, yeah.


333
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.750
她统管着所有女巫
She's the ruler of them all.


334
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.880
强大  邪恶
All-powerful, pure evil,


335
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.610
毫无怜悯之心
and without a stitch of mercy.


336
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.460
传说她是在挪威的
Yeah. Legend has it, she was hatched


337
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.450
冻原上孵化出来的
on the frozen tundra of Norway.


338
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.780
瞧瞧这个
Now, take a look at that.


339
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.620
怎么  你要站在那盯着看我一整天吗
What, you just gonna stand there and stare at me all day?


340
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.270
需要帮忙吗
Can I help you?


341
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.220
帮我把行李卸下来  我去登记入住
You can unload this car while I check in to this here hotel.


342
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.670
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.


343
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.930
这是车钥匙
Here's the key.


344
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.630
还有
Oh, and...


345
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.220
不必了
No.


346
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.110
留着您的钱吧  女士
You keep your money, ma'am.


347
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.200
祝您入住愉快
And enjoy yourself.


348
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.100
我会的
I think I will.


349
00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.750
外婆对这家酒店的描述是对的
Grandma was right about this hotel.


350
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.520
它确实很豪华
It sure was fancy.


351
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.680
为了摆脱那个女巫
She brought us to the Gulf of Mexico


352
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.670
她带我们来到了墨西哥湾
to get away from that witch.


353
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.850
但她绝不会想到我们即将经历什么
But she had no idea what we were about to step into.


354
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.490
小心你的老鼠
Be careful with the mouse.


355
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.270
-不行  -看在上帝的份上  你也太不讲道理了
- No. - For God's sake, i think you're being extremely unreasonable.


356
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.170
不行  黛德丽  我最后说一遍
No, Deidre. For the last time,


357
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.880
我不会让那个女人进我的房子的
I will not have that woman in my house.


358
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.120
-她是个很好的伙伴  -绝不可能  黛德丽
- Oh, she's very good company. - Absolutely not, Deidre.


359
00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.820
我的天啊
Oh, for God's sake,


360
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.420
布鲁诺  你的脸
Bruno, your face.


361
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.420
真是哪里都不能带你去
Obviously can't take you anywhere.


362
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.110
您的房门钥匙  女士
Here you are, ma'am.


363
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.590
欢迎防止虐待儿童国际协会成员莅临

364
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.730
来吧  我们拿到钥匙了
Come on, we got our key.


365
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.690
我们住766号房间
We are in room 766.


366
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.220
听上去是个好房间
Sounds like a good room.


367
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:25.390
你还好吗  外婆
You okay, Grandma?


368
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.780
这是我们离开家后你第一次咳嗽
That's the first time you coughed since we left the house.


369
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.140
需要帮助吗  女士
Can I help you, madam?


370
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.430
你一定是埃斯顿的表亲了
Oh! You must be Eston's cousins.


371
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.600
是的  他坚持让你住766号房间
Yes, he insisted that you stay in room 766.


372
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.090
那是木兰套间
That's the Magnolia.


373
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.720
我们最好的普通套房之一
This is one of our most lovely junior suites.


374
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.070
你可真是个幸运的家伙  对吧
And aren't you a lucky fella? Hmm?


375
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.750
不是每天
It's not every day


376
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.090
都有像你这样的年轻人
that a young gentleman such as yourself is fortunate


377
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.250
能幸运地住进这么高级的酒店
to come and stay in such a fine hotel as this now, is it?


378
00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.730
走吧  盖茨比
Come on, Gatsby.


379
00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.860
我们走
Let's go.


380
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.520
去找我们的房间吧
Let's go find our room.


381
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.000
要我带您去吗
Would you like me to show you?


382
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.700
在四楼
It's on the fourth floor.


383
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.600
外婆  如果我们住在四楼
Grandma, if we're on the fourth floor,


384
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.520
为什么房间号是766
why is it number 7-6-6?


385
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.790
因为建酒店的人是个数字命理学家
Because the man who built this hotel was a numerologist.


386
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.570
他相信数字是有意义的
He believed numbers have meaning.


387
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.390
我对数字也略知一二
I know a little something about numbers.


388
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.520
七和六在一起意味着考验即将来临
Seven and six together means a test is coming.


389
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.250
两个六一起意味着充裕
Two sixes mean abundance.


390
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.150
看起来  一场大考验将会到来
So, it look like a big test might be coming.


391
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.390
欢迎防止虐待儿童国际协会的成员莅临

392
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.900
欢迎光临
Well, hello there.


393
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.770
奥尔良帝国岛大酒店

399
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.600
对不起  女士
I'm sorry, madam,


400
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.510
但我们酒店有非常严格的禁养宠物规定
but the hotel has a very strict no-pet policy.


401
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.500
你看起来懂得
You seem like the sort of man


402
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.540
欣赏我的宝贝

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.440
但你觉得
But what do you think of...


414
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.870
老鼠怎么样
mice?


415
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.390
老鼠
Mice?


416
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.610
是的  老鼠
Yeah. Mice.


417
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.090
如果这个酒店里有到处乱跑的老鼠
What would you do if there were mice


418
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.620
你会怎么办
running all around in this hotel?


419
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.080
我可以向你保证  女士
Well, I can assure you, madam,


420
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.260
这里永远都不会有老鼠
there would never be any mice...


421
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.850
但如果有呢  假设有的话
But if there were? Hypothetically?


422
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.250
假设有的话
Oh, hypothetically.


423
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.870
好吧  我想我会...
Yes, I suppose, well, I would, uh...


424
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.850
我会打电话给灭鼠公司
I would call the exterminator.


425
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.240
说得没错
Exactly!


426
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.920
听到了吗  姐妹们
You see, girls?


427
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.700
他会打电话给灭鼠公司
He would call the exterminator!


428
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.000
像所有头脑正常的人类一样
Just like any normal human with his head screwed on right,


429
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.710
他会消灭那些小鬼
he would exterminate those brats.


430
00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.920
是老鼠
Uh... Rats.


431
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.090
我们会消灭老鼠
We would exterminate the rats.


432
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.510
邪恶
Evil.


433
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.020
没有别的词可以形容她们了
There's no other way to describe them.


434
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.040
纯粹的  毫不掩饰的邪恶
Pure, unvarnished evil.


435
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.500
这就是女巫
That's what witches are.


436
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.620
你知道我总是咳嗽吧
Now, you see this here cough of mine?


437
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.730
有可能就是女巫害的
It was likely brought on by a witch.


438
00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.090
可能就是你在杂货店看到的那个
Probably that one you saw in the grocery store.


439
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.120
真的吗  女巫可以让你咳嗽吗
Really? A witch can make you cough?


440
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.060
当然可以  你最好相信我说的
Oh, you bet your sweet patootie they can.


441
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.970
外婆  怎么区分真正的女巫和普通的女人呢
Grandma, how can you tell a real witch from a normal lady?


442
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.480
首先  女巫根本不是真的女人
Well, first of all, witches aren't really women at all.


443
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.290
她们是化成人形的恶魔
They're demons in human shape.


444
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.500
所以如果你仔细观察女巫
That's why if you look closely at a witch,


445
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.880
就会发现她的嘴角很长
you'll notice the corners of her mouth is elongated,


446
00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.760
几乎延伸到她的耳朵
stretching almost up to her ears,


447
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.340
通常还用浓妆加以遮盖
and that's usually hidden with pancake makeup.


448
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.700
真正的女巫总是戴着手套  从来不摘
And a real witch always wears gloves. Always.


449
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.630
因为真正的女巫是没有手的
Because a real witch doesn't have hands.


450
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.790
只有爪子
She's got claws.


451
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.730
爪子
Claws?


452
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.600
她们也没有脚趾
And they don't have toes.


453
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.610
她们丑陋的脚像是
Their ugly feet look like


454
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.860
所有脚趾都被斧头砍下来了
their toes got chopped off with an axe.


455
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.160
所有的女巫都是光头
And all witches are bald.


456
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.970
脑袋像光溜溜的煮鸡蛋
As bald as a boiled egg.


457
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.340
所以她们戴假发
So, they wear wigs.


458
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.640
这会让她们长可怕的疮
And it gives them nasty sores.


459
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.040
"假发疹"  女巫们是这么叫的
"Wig rash," The witches call it.


460
00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.490
让她们很难受得要命
And it makes them crazy.


461
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.100
所以  手套
So, gloves,


462
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:01.980
假发
wigs.


463
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.240
这就是全部了吗
Is that everything?


464
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.630
鼻洞
Nose-holes.


465
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.740
-鼻洞  -是的  鼻孔
- Nose-holes? - Yeah. Nostrils.


466
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.880
鼻洞
Nose-holes.


467
00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:12.000
女巫的鼻洞比正常人的大
Witches have larger nose-holes than normal people.


468
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.490
当她们想要嗅出一个孩子时
When they need to sniff out a child,


469
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.770
这些鼻洞就会扩大
those nose-holes can grow out


470
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.450
直径可达到20厘米
as big as eight inches in diameter.


471
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.440
但记住  女巫觉得小孩很臭
But, mind you, children smell horrible to witches.


472
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.440
刚洗过澡的小孩也是吗
Even if the kid just had a bath?


473
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.780
那就更臭了
That makes it worse.


474
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.490
刚洗干净的小孩对女巫来说闻起来像狗屎
A freshly clean kid smells like dog poop to a witch.


475
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.520
-狗屎  -没错
- Dog poop? - That's right.


476
00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.470
小孩越干净
And the cleaner the kid,


477
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.470
对女巫来说就越难闻
the poopier he smells to a witch.


478
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.410
也许我该停止洗澡了
Maybe I should stop taking baths.


479
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:40.960
孩子  别惹我生气
Child, don't test me.


480
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.000
女巫能在我们睡觉的时候进来抓我们吗
Can a witch come in here and get us while we sleep?


481
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.390
不
No.


482
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.150
完全不会
Not at all.


483
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.530
女巫从不做傻事
Witches never do silly things like


484
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.340
像爬排水管或者闯进别人家里
climbing drainpipes or breaking into people's houses.


485
00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.890
而且  她们也不知道我们在哪
Besides, they have no idea where we are.


486
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.120
好吧  但我还是有点害怕
Okay, but I'm still a little scared.


487
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.540
过来吧  来这里  小家伙
Over here, come on, little man.


488
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.320
来吧
There we go.


489
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.440
好好睡一觉
Get some sleep.


490
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.930
是吗
Really?


491
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.960
第二天早上
The next morning,


492
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.030
阳光明媚  空气清新
the sun was shining and the air was crispy clear.


493
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.510
我安静无声  好让外婆可以睡觉
I kept quiet as a mouse so Grandma could sleep in,


494
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.530
我自己做了决定
and I took it upon myself


495
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:47.900
给她点了客房早餐
to order her some room service breakfast.


496
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:53.430
早餐来了  外婆
Here's your breakfast, Grandma.


497
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.610
炒鸡蛋  乡村炸牛排
Scrambled eggs, chicken fried steak,


498
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.040
玉米粗粉  山核桃卷
hominy grits, pecan sticky buns,


499
00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.860
大黄草莓酱
rhubarb strawberry jam,


500
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.230
一壶薄荷甜冰茶
and a pitcher of sweet iced tea with mint.


501
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.730
闻起来真特别
That sure smells special.


502
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.080
天呐  我起太晚了
Mercy, I slept in late.


503
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.470
谢谢你给我点了早餐  亲爱的
Well, thank you for ordering me breakfast, darling.


504
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.360
我给了客房服务员五毛钱小费
I gave the room service guy a half a dollar tip.


505
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.280
可以吗
Was that okay?


506
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.980
你真有绅士风度
That's mighty gentlemanly of you.


507
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.190
外婆  你没事吧
Grandma, are you okay?


508
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.120
我没事  就是喉咙有点痒
I'm fine. Just a little tickle.


509
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.780
把那杯茶递给外婆吧
Grab Grandma that glass of tea.


510
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.390
听着  外婆今天要休息一下
And listen, Grandma's gonna take it easy today.


511
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.690
但我想你出去外面转一转
But I want you to get outside and run around.


512
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.770
去海边看看  好好玩玩
Go down to the water. Have fun.


513
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.510
我在想我可以去训练黛西
I was thinking I would do some training with Daisy.


514
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.270
带她一起去
Well, take her with.


515
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.730
只是别让她太靠近海边
Just don't let her get too close to the water.


516
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.390
我可不想让那些大海蛇抓到她
I wouldn't want some big old sea snake to grab ahold of her.


517
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.690
海蛇
Sea snake?


518
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.210
我逗你的  根本没有什么海蛇
I'm just joshing. There ain't no sea snakes.


519
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.060
你去吧  玩得开心
You go on now. Have fun.


520
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.560
别担心我  我没事
And don't worry about me. I'm fine.


521
00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.580
虽然我知道外婆说有海蛇是开玩笑的
Even though I knew grandma was kidding about the sea snakes,


522
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.960
但是我不想冒险
I didn't wanna take any chances,


523
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.890
所以我们没出去
so we stayed inside.


524
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.600
可是没想到
And wouldn't you know,


525
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.700
我们走到了一个大宴会厅
we came upon the big ballroom where it turns out


526
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.740
防止虐待儿童国际协会的人
the International Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children folks


527
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.920
要在那里开会
were gonna have their conference.


528
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.280
那边的
You there!


529
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.990
你在做什么
And what are you doing?


530
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:27.560
非法闯入吗
Breaking and entering?


531
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.200
想找一个安静的地方
Looking for a quiet spot.


532
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.230
做什么
For what?


533
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.400
训练
Training.


534
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.480
训练什么
Training what?


535
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.500
真不错  他叫什么
Cool. Super. What's his name?


536
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.720
是她  她叫黛西
It's a she. And her name is Daisy.


537
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:42.200
我能抱抱她吗
Can I hold her?


538
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.270
她不太喜欢陌生人
She's not too comfortable around strangers.


539
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.040
她会什么特技吗
Can she do any tricks or anything?


540
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.240
我们正准备开始训练
We were just about to do some training.


541
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.190
想看看吗
Wanna watch?


542
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.790
现在几点了
What time is it?


543
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.560
有位亲切的女士叫我12点25分在这里见她
A nice lady told me to meet her here at 12:25.


544
00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:01.210
她说她会给我六块瑞士巧克力
She said she would give me six bars of Swiss chocolate.


545
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:02.570
你叫什么名字  我叫...
What's your name? I'm...


546
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.820
布鲁诺·詹金斯
Bruno Jenkins!


547
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.020
我到处在找你  小伙子
I've been looking for you everywhere, young man.


548
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.420
你爸爸很生气
Your father is furious.


549
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.620
妈妈  你好
Hello, Mother.


550
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.100
这是我的新朋友
This is my new friend.


551
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:12.560
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.


552
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.080
看看你的手  脏死了
Look at your hands, they're filthy!


553
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:19.010
看看你的衣服  简直一团糟
Look at your shirt! It's a complete mess!


554
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.320
跟我走
Come with me.


555
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.740
你都做了什么
What have you been doing?


556
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.320
在香肠厂里跑来跑去吗
Running around in a sausage factory?


557
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.890
大厅里一个人都没有
The room was completely empty.


558
00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.470
正是我和黛西训练的最佳场所
A perfect place for me and Daisy to do our training.


559
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.780
而且我想
And I figured,


560
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.390
如果防止虐待儿童国际协会的人来了
if all the Prevention of Cruelty to Children people showed up,


561
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.590
他们大概也不会责备一个
they would probably look kindly on a young mouse trainer


562
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.840
忙自己的事的年轻驯鼠师
who was just going about his business.


563
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.470
天呐  吓死我了
Jeez, that scared the crap out of me.


564
00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.110
我们到了
So, here we are.


565
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.100
这就是皇家大宴会厅
Here is the Le Grand Imperial Ballroom


566
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.500
或是我们所说的沙龙大展厅
or Le Salon Grande, as we call it.


567
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.280
其实我们管这里叫壁画厅
Well, actually we call it the Mural Room


568
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.520
因为这些美丽的壁画...
because of all these beautiful murals...


569
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.970
我听说这里只有一扇门进出是吗
I was told there is only one door in and out, yeah?


570
00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.010
是的
Yeah. Yes.


571
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.940
只有这一扇门进出
There's, only that door there, in and out,


572
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.020
当然了
and which, of course,


573
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.410
消防局局长对此很不满意
does not make the fire marshal very happy.


574
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.180
所以你们可别点火
So, don't you go starting any fires.


575
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.350
这间大厅可以
This room will do.


576
00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.090
好的
Right, so...


577
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.190
如果女士们有任何需要的话
Yeah, so, if there's any... Is there anything else that you ladies...


578
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.860
不需要
No.


579
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.890
-不需要吗  -再见
- No? - Bye-bye.


580
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.480
好吧
All right.


581
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.110
西尔莎  把门锁上
Saoirse, secure the room!


582
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:06.390
你们这些假扮的女士们
Okay, you so-called ladies.


583
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.540
准备解除伪装
Prepare for removal.


584
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.310
醒醒
Wake up.


585
00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.500
你们这些满身束缚的女妖
Okay, you trussed-up succubines,


586
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.630
准许摘掉手套
you may remove your gloves.


587
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:25.840
准许脱掉鞋子
You may remove your shoes.


588
00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.490
然后
And...


589
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:49.490
准许摘掉假发
you may remove your wigs!


590
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.870
她们全都是女巫
They're all witches.


591
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.580
我真的害怕了  吓得浑身发冷
My blood ran cold as I started to get real scared.


592
00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:25.320
我被困在一个满是秃头女巫的大厅里了
Here I was, trapped in a room with a bunch of bald-headed witches!


593
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:29.290
那个凶狠的光头老大
And the mean one, the bald-head honcho


594
00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:31.190
就站在我的上方
who was standing right above me,


595
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.430
下达各种命令
the one who was giving all the orders,


596
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.600
我一看清她的样子
as soon as I got a good look at her,


597
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.810
立刻就知道她是谁了
I knew instantly who she had to be.


598
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.590
她是高阶女巫
She's the Grand High Witch.


599
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.830
女巫们
Witches.


600
00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.890
女巫们
Witches.


601
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:08.910
你们就是一群废物
You are a heap of good-for-nothing worms!


602
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.400
今早
This morning,


603
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.030
我在吃早餐
I'm having my breakfast


604
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.130
从窗户望出去  望着海滩
and I'm looking out the window, at the beach,


605
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.780
我看到了什么
and what am I seeing?


606
00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.930
我看到了什么
What am I seeing?


607
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.540
我看到了几十个
I'm seeing dozens...


608
00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.440
我看到了几百个
I'm seeing hundreds...


609
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.240
我看到成百上千个讨厌的小鬼
I'm seeing hundreds of repulsive little brats


610
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.270
在沙滩上玩耍
playing in the sand,


611
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:43.340
这让我顿时没了食欲
and it's putting me right off my food!


612
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.760
所以
So...


613
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.850
我的命令如下
Here are my orders.


614
00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:04.470
你们要把世界上每一个小孩
I want every child in the world...


615
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.290
都消灭掉
rubbed out!


616
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.910
压扁  挤爆  碾碎
Squashed, squirted, and frittered!


617
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:18.430
大人  您有什么计划吗
Your Excellency, do you have a plan?


618
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:22.720
我们怎么可能消灭所有的孩子呢
How can we possibly wipe out every child?


619
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.730
这其实是个好问题
That was actually a good question.


620
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:40.820
虽然违抗上级  但是个好问题
Insubordinate but a good question.


621
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.140
我当然有计划
Of course I have a plan.


622
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:50.880
我要你们都回到自己可悲的小镇上
I want each of you to return to your pathetic little town.


623
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.640
去开一家
And open...


624
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.680
糖果店
a candy store.


625
00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.420
在这家店里
And in this store


626
00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:05.750
你们只卖最高档  最美味的糖果
you will sell only the highest quality, tastiest candy.


627
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.580
你们也许在想
Now, you're probably wondering,


628
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.000
我哪里有钱开糖果店呢
"Where do I get the money to buy a candy shop?"


629
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.480
这个问题我也想过了
Well, I have thought of that too.


630
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:23.010
在我的房间里  666号房间
In my room, room number 666,


631
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:28.140
我有个箱子  里面装满了崭新的百元大钞
I have a steamer trunk filled with brand-new, crisp $100 bills!


632
00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.110
666号房间
Room 666.


633
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:35.200
记住  666号房间
Remember that room number 666


634
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.020
你们的店里
and your shops will sell


635
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:41.460
只卖最高档  最美味的糖果
only the highest quality, tastiest candy.


636
00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:46.490
然后
And...


637
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.570
我们用86号配方
We use Formula Number 86


638
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.930
慢性变鼠剂
Delayed Action Mouse Maker!


639
00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.210
一颗糖果加一滴变鼠剂
One drop of Mouse Maker in a piece of candy


640
00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.890
能让一个肮脏的小孩
will transform a dirty little child


641
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.400
在一小时后变成老鼠
into a mouse in one hour!


642
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.520
加两滴
Two drops


643
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.900
能让恶心的小鬼在30后变成老鼠
will transform the disgusting little brat in 30 minutes.


644
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.600
加三滴  则立即生效
And three drops is instantaneous.


645
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.870
立即变成老鼠
An instant mouse!


646
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.290
过奖了
No, no, no.


647
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.180
都停下
Shut up.


648
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.390
那么
So,


649
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.250
不到一小时前
less than an hour ago,


650
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:49.390
我在大堂里发现了一个难闻的小男孩
I found a repulsive smelly little boy in the lobby


651
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:54.130
我给了他一块极其昂贵的瑞士巧克力
and I gave him an outrageously expensive bar of Swiss chocolate.


652
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:58.380
那块巧克力加了一滴
A chocolate bar that was laced with one drop


653
00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.050
-我的86号  -不是吧
- of my Number 86... - Oh, no.


654
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.070
慢性变鼠剂
Delayed Action Mouse Maker potion!


655
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.250
布鲁诺
Bruno.


656
00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:04.530
我告诉那个贪婪的小鬼
And I told the greedy little brat


657
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.860
12点25分来这里见我
to meet me here at 12:25.


658
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.910
所以  不到十分钟后
So, in less than 10 minutes,


659
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:16.540
你们这些可怜的女巫就会看到我是多么天才
all you pathetic witches will see what a true genius I am!


660
00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:26.540
天才  天才  天才
Genius! Genius! Genius!


661
00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.890
都闭嘴
Quiet!


662
00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:15.370
我的巧克力在哪里
Where's my chocolate?


663
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:17.240
是那个贪婪的小白痴
It's the greedy little cretin.


664
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.450
快点  把你们的假发戴上
Quick! Put on your wigs!


665
00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.540
欢迎你...
Welcome, you...


666
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.000
英俊帅气的小伙子
fine, handsome man.


667
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.160
我们正恭候大驾
We've been waiting.


668
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.580
宝贝
Darling boy.


669
00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.590
这是给你的巧克力
I have your chocolate for you.


670
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.170
你答应给我六块巧克力
You promised me six bars of chocolate.


671
00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:59.080
你手上只有一块
I only see one in your hand.


672
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.420
你们看  女士们
You see, ladies,


673
00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.970
他不仅又胖又蠢  还贪得无厌
not only is he fat and stupid but greedy too.


674
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:21.730
没错  小伙子

这是你的美味巧克力
Here is your delicious chocolate.


676

680
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.760
就在这  亲爱的

681
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.470
黛西  我们该怎么办
Daisy, what do we do?


682
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.120

684
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.900
把巧克力给我  给我
Give me my chocolate. Give it to me.


685
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.530
三

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.920
-给我  给我  给我  -二

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.770
开始
Ignition!


689
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.170
那个臭小鬼
That smelly brat,


690
00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.710
讨厌的寄生虫

再来几个人帮忙
Let's get some more hands in here.


774
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.240
现在怎么办
So, now what?


775
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.780

Look, all we need to do is make our way to the elevator,

831
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:00.540
我很遗憾  布鲁诺
I'm so sorry, Bruno.


832
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.010
那些可恶的坏女巫也把你变成老鼠了
Those nasty, evil witches got you too, huh?


833
00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:05.510
没错  她们把我彻底变成老鼠了
Yes. They got me good and proper.


834
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:07.300
今天真是糟糕透了
It's been an awful day.


835
00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.510
还有谁肚子饿了吗
Anybody else hungry?


836
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:12.410
黛西以前也是个小孩  女孩
Oh, and Daisy used to be a kid... A girl too.


837
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.180
亲爱的  你之前为什么不说呢
Why didn't you say something before, darling?


838
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:17.540
因为身为一只老鼠  说话太危险了
Because it can be very dangerous for a mouse to talk.


839
00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.700
大多数人不理解情况  他们会被吓到
Most people don't understand and they get scared.


840
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.660
我那天晚上差点就说话了
I almost said something the other night


841
00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.440
在你讲爱丽丝·布鲁的故事的时候
when you told the story about Alice Blue


842
00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.320
你说她被变成了一只鸡
getting turned into a chicken,


843
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:28.290
但是我改变主意了
but I thought better of it.


844
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.230
你也是被某个邪恶的坏女巫变成老鼠的
So, some wicked, evil witch mouse-afied you.


845
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:33.310
是的  女士  四个月前
Yes, ma'am, four months ago.


846
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:36.920
就在我逃出孤儿院的那天下午
On the very same afternoon I ran away from the orphanage.


847
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.110
当时的情况是  一位和蔼的女士
Well, what happened was, a kind lady...


848
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.040
我当时以为她很和蔼
Well, I thought she was kind.


849
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.380
总之  她给我了一块巧克力
Anyway, she offered me a chocolate bar,


850
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.860
我还没反应过来就噗的一声
and before I knew it, poof!


851
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.960
变成老鼠了
I was transformed.


852
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:50.170
然后  说时迟那时快
Then, faster than a hot knife cuts through butter,


853
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:53.170
一个乞丐把我抓起来  卖给了宠物店
a panhandler scoops me up and sells me to a pet store


854
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.110
换钱给自己食物
so he could buy food.


855
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.740
好吃的
Yum!


856
00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.790
我很遗憾  黛西
I'm so sorry, Daisy.


857
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.710
玛丽  我的本名是玛丽
Mary. Uh, my real name is Mary.


858
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.210
玛丽  这个名字真好听
Mary. That's a pretty name.


859
00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:04.100
打扰一下
Excuse me.


860
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.320
你们老是说到吃的  这让我真的很饿
All this talk about food is making me really hungry.


861
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.880
我可以吃点葡萄吗
Can I have one of those grapes?


862
00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.720
所以  高阶女巫
So, it was the Grand High Witch,


863
00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:15.470
她就在这家酒店里
and she's in this very hotel?


864
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.930
我们得做点什么让你们变回来  拨乱反正
We got to do something to turn you back. Make this right.


865
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:21.210
高阶女巫的房间里有很多药水
The Grand High Witch has a room full of potion.


866
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:24.740
她打算用这些药水将全世界的孩子都变成老鼠
And she's gonna use it to turn every kid in the world into a mouse.


867
00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.260
我们必须救他们
We have to help them.


868
00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.770
-是谁  -酒店维修员
- Who is it? - Hotel maintenance.


869
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:31.250
快躲起来
Quick, hide.


870
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:36.040
来  跳进我的编织包里
Here. Hop in my knitting tote.


871
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.950
保持低调
Keep your heads down.


872
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:47.130
你好
Yes.


873
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:48.530
很抱歉打扰你  女士
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am,


874
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:51.130
我们收到报告说  可能有鼠患
but we got a report of a possible rodent infestation.


875
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:53.930
鼠患  在这么贵的酒店里
Rodent infestation? In a hotel this expensive?


876
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:56.000
这比屠宰日的猪叫还疯狂
That's crazier than a hog on slaughter day.


877
00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:58.240
是的  女士  可能只是虚惊一场
Yes, ma'am. It's probably nothing.


878
00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:00.200
声称看到老鼠的那位服务员
The maid who said she saw the rodents has a tendency


879
00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.760
她平时就有点大惊小怪
to be a bit high-strung.


880
00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.600
但是  为了保险起见
But, to be on the safe side,


881
00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.090
我想在房间里放几个捕鼠夹
I thought I'd lay these here traps,


882
00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:06.430
-如果你不介意的话  -好的
- if you don't mind. - Okay.


883
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:07.750
我们每个房间都要放
We put them in all the rooms.


884
00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.380
只是以防万一
Just to be safe.


885
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:14.340
是多大的老鼠  小老鼠吗
So, uh, what are they? Mice?


886
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.260
不是  女士
No, ma'am.


887
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:18.400
服务员说她看到了一群又大又丑的巨鼠
Maid said she saw a swarm of huge, ugly rats.


888
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:19.800
至少有十几只
At least a dozen of them.


889
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.580
天啊  十几只
Goodness, a dozen?


890
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:23.310
就像我说的
Well, it's like I said,


891
00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:25.610
她平时就有点大惊小怪
she has a tendency to be a bit high-strung.


892
00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.330
新鲜的威斯康星切达干酪
Fresh Wisconsin cheddar.


893
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:35.040
让老鼠们趋之若鹜
Drives them rodents plumb crazy.


894
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.650
它们无法拒绝如此美味
They can't resist it.


895
00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:46.230
总之  如果你听见这些捕鼠夹有响动了
Anyway, you hear any of these traps start snapping,


896
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.580
就给我打电话
give me a call.


897
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:48.990
当然了
I sure will.


898
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.750
这就好
That's right.


899
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:53.540
你什么都不懂吗  葡萄对老鼠有害
Don't you know anything? Grapes can hurt a mouse.


900
00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:54.530
好了  你们三个
All right, you three.


901
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.260
离那些捕鼠夹远点  听见了吗
You stay away from those traps, you hear?


902
00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.280
如果我们能拿到药水的话
If we could just get our hands on some of that potion,


903
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.450
我也许可以逆向工程
I might be able to reverse-engineer it.


904
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:04.700
将其转换成让老鼠变回孩子的药水
Make it a potion that turns mice into children.


905
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.800
旅行的时候我总是带着抗魔药草和盐
I always travel with my anti-hex herbs and salts.


906
00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:10.170
但是谁知道这个邪恶的坏女巫住哪呢
But whoever knows where that wicked, evil witch is.


907
00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:12.980
我们知道  她住在666号房间
We do. She's in room 666.


908
00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.710
我们听到  她让所有的女巫
We heard her tell all those witches


909
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.120
在晚餐后去666号房间见她
to meet her in room 666 right after dinner.


910
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:20.010
而我们住在766号房间
And we're in room 766.


911
00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:21.780
666号房间就在我们楼下
Room 666 is right below us.


912
00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.010
天啊
Good Lord!


913
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.350
那个邪恶的女巫就住在我们楼下
That evil sorceress is living right beneath us?


914
00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:27.230
对  我们这么办
Yes. And here's what we do.


915
00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:29.400
我们等高阶女巫离开房间后
We wait for the Grand High Witch to leave her room,


916
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.290
用外婆的毛线将我放下去
then we use Grandma's knitting wool as a rope to lower me down


917
00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:33.890
放在高阶女巫房间的阳台上
to the Grand High Witch's balcony.


918
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:35.330
我去拿一瓶药水
I grab a bottle of potion,


919
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:38.010
外婆将我拉上来  然后逆转咒语
Grandma hoists me back up, she reverses the spell,


920
00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:40.580
然后  我们就变回孩子了
and ta-da! We're kids again.


921
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.120
小伙子  你这么快就想出了计划
Young man, you think all that up just now?


922
00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.860
灵机一动
Popped right into my head.


923
00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:59.590
肮脏讨厌的小鬼
Vile, filthy brats.


924
00:59:59.610 --> 01:00:01.010
你们让我想吐
You make me puke!


925
01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:05.000
哈迪斯
Hades,


926
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:07.130
世风日下
it's getting so bad,


927
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:10.590
我甚至没法好好享受一杯苦艾酒
I can't even enjoy a glass of wormwood.


928
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:12.970
她就是高阶女巫没错
She's the Grand High Witch, all right.


929
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:32.800
外婆  那就是药水
Grandma, that's the potion.


930
01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.400
她把药水放在冰块中
She's keeping it on ice.


931
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.670
没错  正是我们想要的
Yeah, it's exactly what we need.


932
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.480
哈迪斯  来
Hades, come.


933
01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:41.510
我们喝茶要迟到了
We are late for tea.


934
01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.500
下午茶时间  完美
Teatime. Perfect.


935
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.130
听着  我们只需要一瓶药水
Now look, all we need is one bottle of potion.


936
01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.760
所以尽快拿到一瓶  然后赶紧回来
So, grab one as fast as you can and hurry on back.


937
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:58.920
不知道那个怪物什么时候会回来
No telling when that monster is fixing to return.


938
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.910
我知道你可能很害怕  宝贝
I know you're likely scared, baby.


939
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.190
我不害怕  外婆
I'm not scared, Grandma.


940
01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.220
我也不知道为什么
I don't know why,


941
01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.630
但是自从我被变成了小老鼠后
but ever since I was turned into a small mouse,


942
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.700
这些小事再也吓不到我了
little things don't scare me anymore.


943
01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.950
好吧  抓紧了
Okay. Hold on tight.


944
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.460
难以置信
I can't believe


945
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:34.470
他们居然不让我的宝贝进餐厅
they won't let my precious into the dining room.


946
01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.540
这家廉价的  满是蟑螂的酒店
This fleabag, roach-trap hotel


947
01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.910
排斥我想做的一切
discriminates against everything.


948
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.500
钱  钱  钱
Money. Money, money, money.


949
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:48.790
哈迪斯
Hades,


950
01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:52.440
为什么在这个恶心的人类世界里
why, in this disgusting human world,


951
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.210
做什么事都需要用到钱
do you need money for everything?


952
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:12.430
恶心的  肮脏的金钱
Disgusting, filthy lucre.


953
01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.700
他准备好了
He's ready.


954
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:04.980
哎呀呀
Well, well, well, well.


955
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:08.660
这团毛线为什么在这里
Why is this wool here, I wonder?


956
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.150
你好
Hello.


957
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:15.670
我把织的东西掉到你的阳台上了
I just dropped my knitting over the balcony.


958
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:16.820
但是没关系
But it's all right.


959
01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.210
感谢老天  我手里还捏着它的线
Thank goodness I still have a hold of it on this end.


960
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.940
我继续把它拉上来就好了
Well, I'm just gonna go ahead on and... And pull it on up.


961
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.710
不打扰你了
I'll be out of your way.


962
01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.410
放手吧
Let go.


963
01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.440
我认识你
I know you.


964
01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:30.800
我
Me?


965
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:32.730
我可不觉得
I don't think so.


966
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:34.780
我以前见过你
I have seen you before.


967
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.430
我记得你的脸
I remember your face.


968
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:39.330
你可能在大堂里见过我
You mighta seen me in the lobby, maybe.


969
01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:40.710
不是  不是
No, no, no, no, no.


970
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:42.950
不是在大堂里
Not in the lobby.


971
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.460
我记得你是...
I remember you from...


972
01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.430
干嘛  谁啊
What? Who is it?


973
01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:50.030
我是斯特林格三世
It's Mr. Stringer III,


974
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.970
酒店经理
Hotel Manager.


975
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:51.840
真该死
Curses!


976
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.220
你想让我
You want me to remove


977
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.030
把海滩上的孩子都赶走
the children from the beach?


978
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.680
把他们都赶走
I want them removed.


979
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:07.360
我...我试试看吧
Well, I'll... I'll see what I can do.


980
01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.610
女士  我为你拿来了这个
Madam, I procured this, uh, for you today.


981
01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:11.740
你可能会用得到
I thought you might like it.


982
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.940
是猫笼
It's a kitty carrier.


983
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.670
我觉得
And I thought


984
01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:17.560
可以把你的猫咪朋友放进去
you could put your feline friend in there and you can


985
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.530
然后就可以带着它在酒店里活动
transport him all over the hotel,


986
01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:22.130
包括餐厅
including the dining room.


987
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.420
你可以考虑一下
Thought you might like that.


988
01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:27.800
好
Well,


989
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:34.210
我告诉你吧  送猫笼的先生
let me tell you something, Mister Cat-Cage-Procurer.


990
01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:36.900
我永远都不会
I will never, ever


991
01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:40.290
把我宝贝的猫咪放到...
allow my precious puss to be...


992
01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.220
快看  它喜欢待在笼子里
Well, look at that. He likes it in there.


993
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.550
女士  我差点忘了
Madam, I almost forgot.


994
01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.800
关于你们今晚的晚餐
Regarding your ladies' dinner this evening,


995
01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.230
我们忘记选汤了
we have neglected to select a soup.


996
01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:59.210
有两种选择
Now, there are two choices.


997
01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:01.820
一种是香辣蟹肉浓汤
One is our Cajun spice crab Creole,


998
01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.030
另一种是种植园厨房豌豆汤
and the other one is our plantation kitchen split pea.


999
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.100
哪种更便宜
Which one is cheaper?


1000
01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.990
女士  你一定懂得
Well, madam, I'm sure you will appreciate


1001
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:14.730
新鲜蟹肉的价值  而且...
that the crab is fresh and it is...


1002
01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:15.510
到底是哪种
Which one?


1003
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:22.350
种植园厨房豌豆汤  这个便宜
Plantation kitchen split pea. That's the one.


1004
01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:25.760
那我们就要豌豆汤
Then we will have the split pea soup.


1005
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:26.800
好的  女士
Yes, madam.


1006
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:28.690
还有
And...


1007
01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.980
汤里不加大蒜
no garlic in the soup.


1008
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.490
不加什么
No what?


1009
01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.630
大蒜
Garlic.


1010
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.560
不加大蒜
No garlic?


1011
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:45.370
我结巴了吗
Did I stutter?


1012
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:47.720
不加大蒜
No garlic.


1013
01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:49.580
我的姐妹们
My women,


1014
01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.750
都有食物忌口的问题
all suffer from a selective food avoidance disorder.


1015
01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.800
挑食
Picky eaters.


1016
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.650
好的  女士  如你所愿
Yes, madam. As you wish.


1017
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.080
我会告诉主厨的
I will inform the chef.


1018
01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:04.320
赶紧去吧
You do that.


1019
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:08.050
我自己出去
I'll let myself out.


1020
01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.900
赶紧去吧
You do that.


1021
01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.490
我的宝贝
Well, my precious,


1022
01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:24.510
既然你这么喜欢待在笼子里
since you enjoy being in that cage so much,


1023
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:26.880
那就别出来了
you can stay in it!


1024
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.970
叛徒
Traitor!


1025
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.230
变鼠剂
Mouse Maker potion.


1026
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.340
一滴海索草油
A drop of hyssop...


1027
01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:49.820
少量艾蒿油
A smidgen of mugwort...


1028
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.720
再加上
And now,


1029
01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.430
一点来自卢尔德的疗愈水
a dash of healing water, straight from Lourdes.


1030
01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:59.780
这是最强效的疗愈水
This is the most powerful healing water there is.


1031
01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:05.160
好了
Okay.


1032
01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:09.520
我们牵起手  低下头来
Now let's all join hands and bow our heads.


1033
01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.360
我...
Well, I'll be...


1034
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:45.970
无需多说了
Not much more to say than that.


1035
01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.650
我们总得试试  孩子们
We had to try something, kids.


1036
01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:56.720
这个女巫的力量比我的土方子厉害得多
This witch's power is far greater than my little home remedies.


1037
01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.520
邪恶的力量
Evil power.


1038
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:00.110
还很强大
And strong.


1039
01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.890
比我强大很多
Much stronger than me.


1040
01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.270
拜托别哭  外婆
Please don't cry, Grandma.


1041
01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:07.350
没事的
It'll be okay.


1042
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:09.220
对不起  孩子们
I'm sorry, children.


1043
01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:11.040
不怪你  外婆
It's not your fault, Grandma.


1044
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.750
有时候世事无常
Sometimes things just happen.


1045
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.970
是啊
Yeah, they do.


1046
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.460
其实我不介意当一只老鼠
I actually don't mind being a mouse.


1047
01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:24.680
可以和我的新朋友们整天一起玩耍
I get to hang out with my new friends all day,


1048
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.200
再也不用上学去
don't have to go to school anymore,


1049
01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.920
连开车都不用学了
and I don't have to learn how to drive,


1050
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.060
也就是说我永远都不会出车祸
which means I'll never get into an accident.


1051
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:32.680
你这孩子  过来
Child. Come here.


1052
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:36.240
外婆  你还会照顾我吗
Grandma, will you still take care of me?


1053
01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.570
即使我是一只老鼠
Even if I stay a mouse?


1054
01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.580
我当然会了  亲爱的
Of course I will, darling.


1055
01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.200
无论你是谁
Doesn't matter who you are


1056
01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:42.390
无论你变成什么样
or what you look like,


1057
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:44.010
只要有人爱你  这都没关系
so long as somebody loves you.


1058
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.860
而我永远都会爱你
And I always will.


1059
01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.190
那我的朋友们呢
What about my friends?


1060
01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:53.870
他们也可以留下来吗
Can they stay too?


1061
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:56.430
当然可以
Well, of course.


1062
01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.480
只要他们愿意
If they want to,


1063
01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:01.080
但别忘了  他们都有亲人在思念他们
but don't forget, they all have loved ones who miss them.


1064
01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.650
我就不一定了
I'm not so sure about that.


1065
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.260
别犯傻  他们肯定爱你
Don't be a fool. I'm sure they love you.


1066
01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:07.230
我妈妈觉得我笨手笨脚
My mother thinks I'm clumsy,


1067
01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.380
我爸爸抱怨我总想吃东西
and my father complains that I'm always hungry.


1068
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.580
或许这下他们会爱上真正的你
Well, maybe this will help them love you for who you are,


1069
01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:13.820
而不是因为别的
not for who you ain't.


1070
01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.770
你有父母就很幸运了  布鲁诺
You're fortunate to have parents, Bruno.


1071
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:18.900
有人根本没有
Some of us don't.


1072
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.020
但我们会没事的
But we're gonna be okay.


1073
01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.590
我们有外婆
We have Grandma.


1074
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:24.690
她永远都是我们的家人
And she'll always be our family.


1075
01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.080
所以我们真的很幸运
And for that we are very blessed.


1076
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:29.380
但我想知道的是
But what I wanna know


1077
01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:32.340
我们为什么还站在这里磨磨蹭蹭
is why are we standing around here lollygagging?


1078
01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.000
我们该怎么阻止那些可怕的女巫
How are we gonna stop those horrible witches


1079
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.670
把更多的孩子变成老鼠
from turning more children into mice?


1080
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:38.540
她说得对
She's right.


1081
01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.520
我们得想办法
We got to do something.


1082
01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:42.520
我知道怎么办
I know what we'll do.


1083
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:46.280
我带着86号变鼠剂溜进厨房里
I sneak into the kitchen with the Number 86 Mouse Maker,


1084
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.700
再把变鼠剂倒进女巫们的豌豆汤
then I slip the potion into the witches' pea soup


1085
01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:49.930
把她们都变成老鼠
and turn them all into mice.


1086
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:51.730
你确定吗  小家伙
Are you sure about this, little man?


1087
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.190
这个任务听起来既危险又可怕
This sounds like it could be a very dangerous and scary mission.


1088
01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.530
相信我  外婆  我能做到
Trust me, Grandma, I can handle it.


1089
01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.400
我们到大堂酒吧会合
I'll meet you in the lobby bar.


1090
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.220
布鲁诺和黛西知道是哪个通风口
Bruno and Daisy know which vent.


1091
01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:13.570
小心点  亲爱的
Be careful, darling.


1092
01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.980
我会的  外婆
I will, Grandma.


1093
01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.380
快点
Hurry up there!


1094
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.850
豌豆汤准备好了
The pea soup is ready.


1095
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:43.650
不加大蒜
No garlic.


1096
01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:44.890
我来盛汤  不加大蒜  主厨
I got the soup, no garlic, Chef,


1097
01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:45.750
马上就来
coming right up.


1098
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.550
我的大虾呢
Where are my prawns?


1099
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:51.820
这不是大虾  这是小虾
This is not a prawn, this is a shrimp.


1100
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:53.930
你不懂大虾和小虾的区别吗
You don't know the difference between a shrimp and a prawn?


1101
01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:57.860
数数它的钳子  两个  一  二
Count the pincers. Un, deux. One, two.


1102
01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:00.490
可以把汤盛出来了
Let's start ladling out that soup.


1103
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.140
你们都快点
Come on, you people.


1104
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.260
是  主厨
Yes, Chef.


1105
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.080
你在做什么呢
What are you doing, huh?


1106
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.790
我在准备大虾
I'm getting the prawns ready.


1107
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:12.650
别跟我说这是大虾
Don't tell me that's a prawn.


1108
01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:14.230
-我可是甲壳动物专家  -这就是大虾
- I'm a crustacean expert. - This is a prawn.


1109
01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:15.960
我已经炒大虾三十年了
I've been sauteing prawns for 30 years


1110
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.160
我只用黄油炒
and I only use butter.


1111
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.640
-只用黄油  -从没用过别的油
- Only butter? - Never oil.


1112
01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:21.320
我才不管营养学家怎么说
I don't give a damn about what nutritionists say.


1113
01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:24.070
他们都是糟蹋美食
They are the ruination of cuisine.


1114
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:26.120
永远都用黄油  只用黄油
Always butter, butter only.


1115
01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.000
我的大虾呢
Where are my prawns?


1116
01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:39.590
谁能给我把大虾准备好
Who do I have to get some prawns around here?


1117
01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:44.360
可以把汤盛出来了
Let's start ladling out that soup.


1118
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.840
是  主厨
Yes, Chef.


1119
01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.310
你在哭吗
Are you crying?


1120
01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.290
在我的厨房里不许哭
There's no crying in my kitchen.


1121
01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:54.900
主厨  这道汤需要加点大蒜
Chef, this soup needs some garlic.


1122
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.350
绝对不许加大蒜  斯特林格说的
Absolutely no garlic. Stringer's orders.


1123
01:12:57.610 --> 01:12:58.650
油锅着火
Grease fire.


1124
01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.410
那边水槽下有灭火毯
We got fire blankets under those sinks.


1125
01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.360
是我的大虾烧着了吗
Are those my prawns that just exploded?


1126
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:10.520
别管大虾了  随便放点小虾吧
Forget the prawn, just throw some shrimp in there.


1127
01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:14.660
你们这些蠢货根本不懂...
You idiots don't know how...


1128
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:22.060
谁给我把快刀  让我自尽算了
Someone get me a sharp knife so that I can kill myself.


1129
01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.600
谁去联系灭鼠公司
Somebody call an exterminator.


1130
01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.690
看  那就是我父母
Look, there's my mother and father.


1131
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:42.560
那就是你父母
That's your mother and father?


1132
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.750
千真万确
As I live and breathe.


1133
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.790
布鲁诺  我想是时候跟你父母打个招呼了
Bruno, I think it's time to say hello to your parents.


1134
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:51.140
你疯了吗  就在酒吧里
Are you mad? Right here in the bar?


1135
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.210
时不我待
There's no time like the present.


1136
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.830
打扰了  你们是詹金斯夫妇吗
Excuse me, are you Mr. And Mrs. Jenkins?


1137
01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.800
有什么事吗
Can we help you?


1138
01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.040
恐怕我有一些
I'm afraid I have some,


1139
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.040
关于你们的儿子布鲁诺的奇怪消息
well, strange news about your son, Bruno.


1140
01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:17.900
布鲁诺怎么了  他在哪里
What about Bruno? Where is he?


1141
01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:21.560
或许我们可以找个地方私下谈
Maybe we can go somewhere a bit more private.


1142
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:23.470
私下谈  为什么要私下谈
Private? Why do we have to be private?


1143
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.380
这件事对他来说不好解释
It's not an easy thing for him to explain.


1144
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:28.780
如果我们去你们的房间  他会感到自在许多
He'd be much more comfortable we all went up to your room.


1145
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.550
不  女士
No, no, look here, madam,


1146
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.590
我觉得待在这里就挺好
I'm perfectly comfortable exactly where I am.


1147
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:33.930
所以你要么告诉我们布鲁诺在哪里
So, either you tell me where I can find Bruno


1148
01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:36.070
要么就别烦我们
or you just leave us alone now.


1149
01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.330
好吧
Well...


1150
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:40.730
他就在这里
got him right here.


1151
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:43.490
是老鼠  老鼠
That's a mouse! A mouse!


1152
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:45.480
你到底有什么毛病
What in God's name is wrong with you?


1153
01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.300
快把这只恶心的耗子扔出去
Get that filthy rodent out of here!


1154
01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.560
不不不  这就是布鲁诺
No, no, no, no. This is Bruno.


1155
01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.990
布鲁诺  说点什么啊
Bruno, say something to them.


1156
01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.920
"说点什么"  你疯了吗
"Say something"? Are you insane?


1157
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:57.360
离我们远点  我要叫经理了
Get away from us before I call the manager.


1158
01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.750
别嚷嚷了  这是你儿子布鲁诺
Quit all this hollering. This is your son, Bruno.


1159
01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:01.600
经理  谁去把经理叫来
Manager! Someone get me the manager.


1160
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.780
这女人把我妻子吓得半死
This woman has just scared my wife half to death.


1161
01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.890
她手提包里装着老鼠
She's walking around with rats in her handbag.


1162
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:09.510
布鲁诺  你为什么不说话
Bruno, why didn't you say something?


1163
01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:14.980
我爸爸讨厌我边嚼东西边说话
My father hates it when I talk with my mouth full.


1164
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:16.800
外婆
Grandma.


1165
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:17.790
在这里
Down here.


1166
01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:20.240
你回来了  谢天谢地
There you are. Thank the Lord.


1167
01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.140
怎么样
So, how'd it go?


1168
01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.010
汤做好了
Soup is on.


1169
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.690
看  豌豆汤
Look! The pea soup.


1170
01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:38.830
请用  没加大蒜
Here we are, garlic free.


1171
01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.610
打扰了  女士  我能跟你谈谈吗
Excuse me, madam, may I have a word with you?


1172
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:47.200
请这边走
Please, this way.


1173
01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.720
这边来
Just over here.


1174
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:57.400
你现在不会随身带着
You wouldn't happen to be carrying around a mouse


1175
01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.290
一只老鼠吧
on your person now, would you?


1176
01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:00.300
-一只老鼠  -嗯
- A mouse? - Mmm-hmm.


1177
01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.820
我为什么要随身带着一只老鼠
Why on earth would I be carrying around a mouse?


1178
01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.260
这是不是跟酒店里到处摆满的
Does this have anything to do with all the rat traps


1179
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.740
捕鼠器有关
being set up all over this hotel?


1180
01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.280
捕鼠器
Rat traps?


1181
01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.690
这就是你的小脑瓜想出的障眼法吗
Is this your pathetic idea of a smoke screen?


1182
01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:11.780
找个客人来替你背黑锅
Accusing your guests of carrying around mice


1183
01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.580
掩盖这家酒店有鼠患的事实
to hide the fact that this hotel has a mouse infestation.


1184
01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.250
不是  小声点  你说什么
No... Shh. What?


1185
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:17.110
我告诉你
I'll tell you this.


1186
01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.120
我花了那么多钱住这家酒店
For what this hotel is costing me,


1187
01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.780
最好别让我看见一只老鼠
I better not see a single mouse.


1188
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:22.780
连一只可爱的小老鼠都不行
Not even a tiny, cute one.


1189
01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.280
没问题  女士  我真...
Yes, madam. I'm so...


1190
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.040
我的错  对不起
My mistake. I'm sorry.


1191
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.740
卢瑟
Luther.


1192
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:31.290
请带这位女士去我们最好的位子
Would you please show this lady to our finest table?


1193
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:32.670
好的  这边请
Certainly. This way.


1194
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.010
抱歉  女士
Apologies, madam,


1195
01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.590
我只是...
I, it's just...


1196
01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:42.880
我们最好的位子  女士
Our finest table, madam.


1197
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.180
谢谢你  卢瑟  我认为
Thank you, Luther. I'm sure


1198
01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:49.280
这个高级餐厅里最好的位子
your finest table in this lovely establishment


1199
01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.980
就是厨房旁边的这张餐桌
is this one right here next to the kitchen.


1200
01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:53.490
我向来喜欢坐在出口附近
I always prefer a table near the exit


1201
01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:55.110
方便随时开溜
so I can get out fast.


1202
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:58.820
好的
Of course.


1203
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:30.770
快看
Check it out.


1204
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.560
他们喜欢喝汤
They love the soup.


1205
01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.230
您选好了吗
Have you decided?


1206
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:38.290
嗯  我要一份什锦饭
Uh, yes, I think I'll have the jambalaya.


1207
01:17:38.290 --> 01:17:40.780
好的  要先喝点什么吗
Excellent. And would you like something to start?


1208
01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:45.250
那些漂亮的女士
Well, that pea soup


1209
01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:47.050
喝的豌豆汤看起来很不错
those fancy ladies are eating looks good.


1210
01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:47.950
我就要那个
I'll have that.


1211
01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:49.710
抱歉  豌豆汤
I'm sorry. That soup is reserved


1212
01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.080
全都被那些女士预订了
strictly for that group of lady guests only.


1213
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.580
请听我一句
If I may,


1214
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:58.000
那些客人对大蒜严重过敏
that large party suffers from a severe garlic allergy.


1215
01:17:58.390 --> 01:18:00.930
所以他们要求汤里不加大蒜
So, they have requested their soup be prepared garlic free.


1216
01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:03.590
味道很淡  几乎难以下咽
It is very bland. Practically inedible.


1217
01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:06.800
我明白了
I see.


1218
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.850
听起来真恶心
That sounds disgusting.


1219
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:12.890
请容我推荐香辣蟹肉浓汤
May I suggest the Cajun spice crab Creole?


1220
01:18:13.410 --> 01:18:15.100
这是我们的招牌菜
It's one of our signature dishes.


1221
01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.270
听起来...
Uh, sounds...


1222
01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.030
您说

1223
01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:26.490
就要虾肉浓汤吧
Uh, the... The shrimp Creole will be fine.


1224
01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:28.780
您是说蟹肉浓汤
You mean the crab Creole?


1225
01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:30.490
对  对  蟹肉浓汤
Yes, yes, the crab Creole.


1226
01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:31.990
好的
Very good.


1227
01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:44.630
躲起来  有人来了
Keep your heads down, we got company.


1228
01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.100
小辫子
Pigtails.


1229
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:57.350
你说什么
I'm sorry?


1230
01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.820
小辫子
Pigtails.


1231
01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.280
你扎了小辫子
You wore pigtails.


1232
01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:07.150
我认识你吗
Do I know you?


1233
01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:13.330
许多年前  在一个破败的小镇上
Many years ago, in a shabby little town.


1234
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.040
阿拉巴马州本地一个破败的小镇
A shabby little town right here in Alabama.


1235
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:20.540
你扎了小辫子
You wore pigtails.


1236
01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.420
你从我手里逃脱了
And you got away from me.


1237
01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.380
记得吗
Remember?


1238
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:35.020
但我抓到了你那个讨厌的朋友
But I got that horrid little friend of yours.


1239
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:37.850
记得...
Remember...


1240
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:49.110
快  搭鼠梯
Quick, mouse ladder.


1241
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:53.410
是你
It was you.


1242
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:56.240
你就是那个转化爱丽丝的坏女巫
You were the filthy witch who turned Alice.


1243
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:03.170
咳得真严重
That's a nasty...


1244
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.530
你们在干什么
What are you doing?


1245
01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:36.200
外婆  快看
Grandma, look.


1246
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:40.710
好样的
Attaboy.


1247
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:03.650
击掌  宝贝
High five, baby!


1248
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:07.020
轰轰烈烈变老鼠
That's some serious ratification.


1249
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:21.450
天啊  爬到我腿上了
Oh, my God! It's on my leg!


1250
01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:32.010
天啊  太震撼了
Lordy, hell's a-poppin'.


1251
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:48.820
过来  你这恶心的生物
Come here, you nasty critter...


1252
01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.120
把它弄下去  弄下去
Get it off! Get it off!


1253
01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:03.960
弄下去
Get it off!


1254
01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:08.880
走吧  孩子们
Come on, kids.


1255
01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.800
是时候开溜了
It's time to skedaddle.


1256
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:22.270
谁去联系灭鼠公司
Somebody call the exterminator!


1257
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.780
干得好
Good job.


1258
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:51.920
看看这些药水
Look at all this potion.


1259
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:56.720
孩子们  我们得把药水全都拿走
Kids, we got to grab every bottle.


1260
01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.720
外婆  那它怎么办
Hey, Grandma, what about him?


1261
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:05.100
等我们走了  我打电话让经理把它放出来
I'll call the manager to let him out once we out of here.


1262
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.190
我弄掉了
I dropped some.


1263
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:11.980
我去捡  外婆
I'll get it, Grandma.


1264
01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.950
那奶酪闻起来真香
That cheese smells awfully good.


1265
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.090
看看你逼我干的好事
Look what you made me do.


1266
01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:24.350
你以为用偷来的钥匙
You think you're so clever,


1267
01:24:24.650 --> 01:24:27.970
闯进我的房间很机智吗
breaking into my room with a stolen key?


1268
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:32.600
但所有人都知道  前台有备用钥匙
But everyone knows they keep a spare key at the front desk.


1269
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:36.910
我们决不会让你恶毒的计划得逞
We'll never let you get away with your filthy, evil plot.


1270
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:39.400
是吗  谁能阻止我
Oh, no? Who's gonna stop me?


1271
01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:45.910
你这样软弱愚蠢的女病人吗
A feeble, stupid, sick woman like you?


1272
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:49.750
你觉得这很好笑吗
Oh, you think that's funny?


1273
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:51.000
不是笑这个
Not that.


1274
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.790
我只是在想
See, I was just thinking.


1275
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:57.170
很快你就什么都做不了了
Pretty soon, you not gonna be able to do much of nothing.


1276
01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:02.680
为什么呢  命不久矣的勇敢小女人
And why is that, brave, little, soon-to-be-dead woman?


1277
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.800
豌豆汤
The pea soup.


1278
01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:10.890
豌豆汤
The pea soup...


1279
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.810
不  不
No... No...


1280
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.610
不
No...


1281
01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:26.030
你个蠢货
You stupid fool.


1282
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.740
我没喝豌豆汤
I did not drink the pea soup.


1283
01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.700
你还记得吗
If you recall,


1284
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:36.080
我被打断了
I was interrupted.


1285
01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:37.630
我们这么办
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.


1286
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:42.300
哎呀呀
Well, well, well.


1287
01:25:43.190 --> 01:25:44.930
我想想
Let me see.


1288
01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:47.550
我要
I think


1289
01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:51.600
把手插进你的胸膛
I will reach into your chest


1290
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:54.640
扯出你虚弱
and rip out your withered,


1291
01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.020
萎缩的心脏
shriveled heart,


1292
01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.320
然后把它捏爆
and squeeze it until it bursts.


1293
01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:03.240
不听不听  王八念经
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.


1294
01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:06.410
唬人的女巫腔调根本吓不到我
All your butt-ugly witch-talk don't scare me one bit.


1295
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:07.700
你该害怕的
It should,


1296
01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:10.130
毕竟你死前最后看到的
considering the last thing you will ever see


1297
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:12.950
将是我窃笑的脸
is my snickering face.


1298
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.500
我
I believe


1299
01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.050
全身心地相信
with every fiber of my being...


1300
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:25.880
到头来
that in the end,


1301
01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:29.850
爱总能战胜仇恨与邪恶
love will always triumph over hatred and evil.


1302
01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.740
是吗
Is that so?


1303
01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.810
虽然你转化了爱丽丝和我的外孙
You may have turned Alice and my grandson,


1304
01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.900
但我会确保你再也没法加害别的孩子
but I will make sure you never turn another child.


1305
01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.900
帮帮我  上帝
So help me, God.


1306
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:40.150
就现在
Now!


1307
01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:54.560
你这愚蠢的老鼠
You stupid rat.


1308
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:55.930
看看你干了什么好事
Look what you've done.


1309
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.890
快跑
Run!


1310
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:59.690
看看你干了什么好事
Look what you've done.


1311
01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.330
你们这群傻耗子
You stupid rodents.


1312
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:06.690
回来
Get back here!


1313
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.090
肮脏的害虫
You filthy pests.


1314
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:12.450
-好吃的  -寄生虫
- Yum. - Parasites.


1315
01:28:12.670 --> 01:28:14.410
小鬼  我会抓住的
Kid, I'm gonna get you,


1316
01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:16.040
你这恶心的害虫
you putrid varmints.


1317
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:23.580
我来抓你了
Now I've got you!


1318
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:26.710
什么
What?


1319
01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:29.840
我听够你的鬼话了
I'm done listening to your trash talk.


1320
01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:32.260
这是什么
What is this?


1321
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.890
蠢货
You fool.


1322
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:40.100
放我出去
Let me out.


1323
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:42.650
放我出去
Let me out!


1324
01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.230
放我出去  放我出去
Let me out! Let me out!


1325
01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.990
我要拔了你们的舌头
I will rip out your tongues.


1326
01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.090
蠢耗子
Stupid mice.


1327
01:28:57.090 --> 01:28:59.090
瓶子里的女巫
The witch in a bottle...


1328
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.950
-放我出去  -瓶子里的女巫
- Let me out. - Witch in a bottle...


1329
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:02.790
拿开这蠢鱼缸  让我出去
Let me out of this stupid fish bowl.


1330
01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.210
外婆  这是那个大箱子的钥匙
Hey, Grandma, this is the key to that big trunk.


1331
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:08.300
那是我的钥匙  那是我的钥匙
That's my key. That's my key.

那是我的钥匙  你这白痴小鬼
That's my key, you pea-brain brat.


1333
01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:12.310
-你们这些白痴寄生虫  -来吧  大伙
- You pea-brain parasites. - Come on, guys.

舌头放回嘴里去
Put your tongue back in your mouth,


1335
01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:19.600
下水道里的脏东西
you filthy sewer guttersnipes.


1336
01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:24.190
你们在干嘛
What are you doing?


1337
01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.230
那是我的
That is mine.


1338
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:27.480
那是我的
That's mine.


1339
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.610
你们这些白痴  恶棍
You idiots. You scoundrels.


1340
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.080
能买好多培根啊
That is a lot of bacon.


1341
01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.630
-生菜  -面团
- Lettuce. - Dough.


1342
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:35.950
你们说得我好饿
Hey, you're making me terribly hungry.


1343
01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:38.200
不  不许碰那个  那是我的
No, get your hands off of that, that's mine!


1344
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:42.000
不许用你们的脏爪碰我的脏钱
Get your filthy paws off my filthy lucre.


1345
01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:44.750
我要戳瞎你们的眼睛  你们看什么
I'll poke out your beady eyes. What are you looking at?


1346
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:47.670
那是什么  外婆
What's that, Grandma?


1347
01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.980
这是世界上所有女巫的
It's a list of names and addresses


1348
01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:52.590
姓名和地址清单
of every witch in the world.


1349
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:56.430
这清单  这笔钱  加上这些药水
With that list and that money and all this potion,


1350
01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:59.310
我们能把世上所有女巫都变成老鼠
we could turn every witch in the world into rats.


1351
01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.260
棒极了
Excellent!


1352
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:04.600
我要用生锈的剪刀剪了你们的尾巴
I'll cut off your tails with rusty scissors.


1353
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:08.150
用指甲剪剪掉你们的耳朵
I'll clip your ears with toenail clippers.


1354
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.860
我要戳瞎你们的眼睛
I'll poke out your beady eyes.


1355
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.030
你们会付出代价的
I'll get you for this!


1356
01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.780
好了  孩子们  跳进来
All right, kiddies, one hop.


1357
01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.160
我们有活要干
We got work to do.


1358
01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:22.370
我差点忘了
I almost forgot.


1359
01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.710
不不不  别别别
No, no, no, don't do that.


1360
01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:32.630
你要干什么
What are you doing?


1361
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:35.550
哈迪斯
Hades.


1362
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:37.840
好猫咪
Good pussy.


1363
01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:40.890
你是只好猫咪
You are a good pussy cat.


1364
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:42.280
乖咪咪
Nice kitty.


1365
01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.240
-你们俩好好玩  -乖咪咪
- You two have fun now. - Nice kitty.


1366
01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:48.190
你这愚蠢生疮流脓的跳蚤窝  宝贝
Ah, you stupid, mangy fleabag. Precious.


1367
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:49.980
把书放回来
Put the books back.


1368
01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:54.280
别过来  你这蠢货  宝贝
Stay back, you stupid, precious...


1369
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:55.860
不  哈迪斯
No! Hades.


1370
01:30:56.210 --> 01:31:00.580
哈迪斯  宝贝  想想是谁喂的你
Hades, precious, remember who feeds you.


1371
01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.030
不  别想吃的
No, don't think about food.


1372
01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:12.170
外婆  你听到了吗
Grandma, you hear that?


1373
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:15.690
不知道你说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.


1374
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:16.840
我什么都没听到
I didn't hear a thing.


1375
01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.470
真是太谢谢了
Well, thank you kindly.


1376
01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.470
也给你
And one for you.


1377
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.930
第二天
The next morning,


1378
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:29.310
我们欢欣鼓舞  开心不已
we were feeling joyful and triumphant.


1379
01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:32.020
实际上  外婆特别开心
As a matter of fact, Grandma was so happy,


1380
01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:35.660
把她的喜悦传播给了酒店全体工作人员
she was spreading her joy to the entire hotel staff.


1381
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:37.150
衷心感谢你所做的一切
Thank you kindly for everything.


1382
01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:38.240
也给你
One for you.


1383
01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:40.910
还有你
And one for you.


1384
01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:43.160
谢谢  女士
Thank you, ma'am.


1385
01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.920
布鲁诺试过向他妈妈解释情况
Bruno tried to explain the situation to his mom.


1386
01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:51.170
你好  妈妈
Hello, Mother.


1387
01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.550
我变成老鼠了
I'm now a mouse.


1388
01:31:58.190 --> 01:31:59.190
-老鼠  -但是我们发现
- It's a mouse! - But it turned out


1389
01:31:59.190 --> 01:32:02.550
詹金斯夫妇不太喜欢老鼠
Mr. And Mrs. Jenkins weren't really mouse people.


1390
01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:04.560
所以我们认为布鲁诺最好
So, we decided it would be best


1391
01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:08.180
还是和我  外婆以及黛西一起住
if Bruno came to stay with me, Grandma, and Daisy.


1392
01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:26.660
再快点  再快点
Faster, faster!


1393
01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:38.420
冲啊
Here we go!


1394
01:32:44.150 --> 01:32:44.970
酷
Cool!


1395
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:50.690
我的发型如何  我的发型如何
How's my hair look? How's my hair?


1396
01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.030
我们再来一次
Let's go again, y'all.


1397
01:32:59.370 --> 01:33:00.860
这次我坐前面
This time I sit in the front.


1398
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:04.030
外婆  我喜欢当老鼠
Grandma, I love being a mouse.


1399
01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:05.990
这话我相信
Oh, I believe you do.


1400
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:07.590
但你知道奇怪的是什么吗
But you wanna know something weird?


1401
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:09.410
我还是感觉自己是个小男孩
I still feel just like a boy.


1402
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:10.660
但你就是啊  亲爱的
But you are, darling.


1403
01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:12.710
生活把我们都改变了
Life changes all of us.


1404
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.670
看看我
I mean, look at me.


1405
01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:15.510
岁月让我逐渐衰老
I'm getting on up in the years,


1406
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.800
但我仍然感觉自己是个小姑娘
but I still feel like a girl.


1407
01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.670
我也仍然感觉自己是个小男孩
And I still feel like a boy.


1408
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:21.300
看吧
See?


1409
01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:22.840
你很明白
You get it.


1410
01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:25.510
永远不要放弃自我
Never give up what you are inside.


1411
01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:31.140
我看你的时候  我看的不是胡须和粉鼻子
When I look at you, I don't see whiskers and a pink nose.


1412
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.100
我看的是你的眼睛
I just see your eyes.


1413
01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:35.190
明亮而美丽
Bright and beautiful.


1414
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:39.110
外婆
Grandma,


1415
01:33:40.670 --> 01:33:42.110
老鼠能活多久
how long does a mouse live?


1416
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.550
普通的老鼠大概能活三年
Oh, an ordinary mouse only lives about three years,


1417
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:49.590
但你不是普通的老鼠  你是人变的老鼠
but you're no ordinary mouse. You're a mouse-person,


1418
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:51.580
人变的老鼠肯定能比普通老鼠
and a mouse-person will almost certainly live


1419
01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:54.120
多活三倍的时间
three times longer than an ordinary mouse.


1420
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:55.420
甚至可能更久
Maybe even longer.


1421
01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:57.680
这真棒
That's great news.


1422
01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.670
我可受不了让别人照顾
I couldn't stand being looked after by anybody else.


1423
01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:02.350
我会变成一只特别老的老鼠
I'll be a very old mouse


1424
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:04.300
你会变成特别老的外婆
and you'll be a very old grandmother,


1425
01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.180
然后我们一起死去
and we'll both die together.


1426
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:08.970
也许有可能  亲爱的
With a little luck, darling.


1427
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:13.390
但是谁都不知道自己能活多久
But no one knows how long their time is on this earth.


1428
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:15.560
只有上帝知道
Only God knows that answer.


1429
01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.940
这是自然规律
And that is the natural order of things.


1430
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:26.820
黛西  布鲁诺和我喜欢和外婆一起生活
Daisy, Bruno, and I loved living with Grandma.


1431
01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:29.740
我们是一个快乐的大家庭
We were one big, happy family.


1432
01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:56.280
圣诞老鼠快乐

1433
01:34:56.410 --> 01:34:58.660
圣诞耗祝福

1434
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:01.540
亚利桑那州

1435
01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.710
欢迎来到拉斯维加斯

1436
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:07.500
捣蛋还是老鼠

1437
01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.840
米兰
比萨
佛罗伦萨
罗马
那不勒斯
索伦托


1438
01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.090
我们整了那群女巫
匿名79


1439
01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:25.480
女巫猎手

1440
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:36.770
我们说到哪了  对了
Where were we? Oh, yeah. That's right.


1441
01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.310
我们到了这里
So, here we are,


1442
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:41.940
准备继续战斗
ready to carry on the fight.


1443
01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.070
继续战斗
Carry on the fight!


1444
01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.500
这些年来  我们已经把美国境内
Over the years, we have turned and mouse-afied


1445
01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:50.530
每一个该死的女巫都变成了老鼠
every damnable witch in these United States.


1446
01:35:52.050 --> 01:35:54.580
我们聚集在此  是要把我们的战斗
So, we are gathered here to take our battle


1447
01:35:54.670 --> 01:35:56.410
推广到全世界
to the entire world.


1448
01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.810
-你们都拿到名单了  对吗  -是  先生
- You have your names, correct? - Yes, sir.


1449
01:36:01.810 --> 01:36:02.880

01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:04.590
是  先生
Yes, sir.


1451
01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:08.770
以及86号变鼠剂
And your Number 86 Mouse Maker potion?


1452
01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:13.640
是  先生  86号变鼠剂  先生
Yes, sir. Number 86 Mouse Maker potion, sir.


1453
01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:15.470
我们去让
Let's get out there


1454
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:20.810
那群女巫自食恶果
and give those witches a taste of their own medicine.


1455
01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.120
你准备好执行这次任务了吗  老伙计
So, you ready for this mission, old-timer?


1456
01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:45.460
外婆  我时刻准备着
Grandma, I've never been more ready.


1457
