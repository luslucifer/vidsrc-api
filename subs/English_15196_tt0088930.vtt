1
00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:47.294
No!

2
00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:11.552
- ls everything ready?
- Oui, monsieur.


3
00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:13.926
You have your instructions?

4
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:33.028
ls everything all right, Mrs. Ho?

5
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:36.745
Dinner will be ready at 7:30.

6
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:51.293
Good evening.

7
00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:53.174
Good evening. I don't know if...

8
00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:55.506
Yes indeed, sir,
you are expected, Colonel.


9
00:04:55.588 --> 00:04:58.182
May I take your coat?
It is Colonel Mustard, isn't it?


10
00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:01.102
- No, that's not my name. My name's...
- Forgive me, sir.


11
00:05:01.177 --> 00:05:04.306
Tonight, you may well feel obliged
to my employer


12
00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.642
for the use of an alias.

13
00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:20.326
And who are you, sir?

14
00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:22.203
I'm Wadsworth, sir.

15
00:05:22.282 --> 00:05:23.784
The butler.

16
00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:35.300
Yvette, could you attend to the colonel
and give him anything he requires.


17
00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:37.301
Within reason, that is.

18
00:05:38.548 --> 00:05:40.471
Wadsworth, I was...

19
00:05:46.556 --> 00:05:48.934
Do come in, madam. 
You are expected.

20
00:05:49.017 --> 00:05:50.485
Do you know who I am?

21
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.064
Only that you are to be known
as Mrs. White.


22
00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:56.741
Yes. It said so
in the letter. But why?

23
00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:16.007
May I introduce you?

24
00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:18.839
Mrs. White, this is Yvette, the maid.

25
00:06:18.922 --> 00:06:21.300
I see you know each other.

26
00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:24.636
- Hello.
- Hello.


27
00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:01.923
Want a lift?

28
00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:03.553
Yes, please.

29
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:09.230
Thanks. I'm late for a dinner date.

30
00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:11.603
Me, too. Where are you going?

31
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.102
Let's see.

32
00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:16.605
Hill House, off Route 41.

33
00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:18.782
Wait a minute. 
Let me look at that.

34
00:07:18.857 --> 00:07:22.031
That's where I'm going.
I got a letter like this.


35
00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:35.290
And this is Mrs. Peacock.

36
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.133
- How do you do.
- Hello.


37
00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:39.590
Yvette, will you go and check
that dinner will be ready


38
00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.764
as soon as all the guests have arrived.

39
00:07:58.688 --> 00:08:01.066
Is this the right address
to meet Mr. Boddy?


40
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:02.321
You must be Mr. Green.

41
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.698
- Yes.
- Sit!


42
00:08:04.777 --> 00:08:06.779
No. Not you, sir.

43
00:08:13.036 --> 00:08:15.835
It should be just off there.

44
00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:24.847
That must be it.

45
00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:30.265
Why has the car stopped?

46
00:08:30.345 --> 00:08:31.597
It's frightened.

47
00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:08.716
Aah!

48
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.193
What a godforsaken place.

49
00:09:26.609 --> 00:09:30.489
Professor Plum and Miss Scarlet.
I didn't realize you were acquainted.


50
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:32.118
We weren't.

51
00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:41.295
May I present
Professor Plum and Miss Scarlet.


52
00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:56.644
Of course, since you've each been
addressed by a pseudonym,


53
00:09:56.723 --> 00:10:00.318
you'll have realized that nobody here
is being addressed by their real name.


54
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.487
Dinner.

55
00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:09.653
I'm sorry.

56
00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:12.455
I'm a little accident-prone.

57
00:10:22.749 --> 00:10:25.047
You'll find your names
beside your places.


58
00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:26.753
Please be seated.

59
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.347
Is this place for you?

60
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.353
Indeed, no, sir.
I'm merely a humble butler.


61
00:10:39.432 --> 00:10:40.854
What exactly do you do?

62
00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:42.856
- I buttle, sir.
- Which means what?


63
00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:44.733
The butler is head of the kitchen
and dining room.


64
00:10:44.812 --> 00:10:46.906
I keep everything tidy. That's all.

65
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:50.110
Well, what's all this about, butler,
this dinner party?


66
00:10:50.193 --> 00:10:53.447
"Ours not to reason why,
ours but to do and die."


67
00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:54.621
Die?

68
00:10:54.739 --> 00:10:56.912
Merely quoting, sir,
from Alfred, Lord Tennyson.


69
00:10:57.408 --> 00:10:59.376
I prefer Kipling myself.

70
00:10:59.452 --> 00:11:02.956
"The female of the species
is more deadly than the male."


71
00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:04.507
You like Kipling, Miss Scarlet?

72
00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:05.799
Sure. I'll eat anything.

73
00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:09.258
Shark's fin soup, madam.

74
00:11:09.337 --> 00:11:10.429
So, is this for our host?

75
00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:12.599
No, sir.
For the seventh guest, Mr. Boddy.


76
00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:14.721
I thought Mr. Boddy was our host.

77
00:11:14.801 --> 00:11:16.223
So did I.

78
00:11:16.302 --> 00:11:19.272
So, who is our host, Mr. Wadsworth?

79
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.852
Well, I'm gonna start while it's still hot.

80
00:11:23.935 --> 00:11:26.063
Now, shouldn't we wait
for the other guest?


81
00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:28.239
I'll keep something warm for him.

82
00:11:28.314 --> 00:11:30.533
What'd you have in mind, dear?

83
00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:05.439
Well, someone's got to break the ice
and it might as well be me.


84
00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:08.647
I mean, I'm used to being a hostess.
It's part of my husband's work.


85
00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:11.278
And It's always difficult
when a group of new friends


86
00:12:11.357 --> 00:12:13.780
meet together for the first time
to get acquainted.


87
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.784
So, I'm perfectly prepared to
start the ball rolling.


88
00:12:16.863 --> 00:12:19.958
I mean, I have absolutely no idea
what we're doing here


89
00:12:20.032 --> 00:12:22.455
or what I'm doing here
or what this place is about,


90
00:12:22.535 --> 00:12:25.459
but I am determined to enjoy myself.

91
00:12:25.538 --> 00:12:26.960
I'm very intrigued.

92
00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:29.383
And, my, this soup's delicious, isn't it?

93
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:35.298
You say you are used to being a
hostess as part of your husband's work?


94
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:39.727
Yes, it's an integral part of your life
when you're the wife of a...


95
00:12:40.553 --> 00:12:43.477
But then I forgot, we're not supposed to
say who we really are,


96
00:12:43.556 --> 00:12:45.558
though heavens to Betsy
I don't know why.


97
00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:47.523
Don't you?

98
00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:49.645
I know who you are.

99
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.817
Aren't you gonna tell us?

100
00:12:50.897 --> 00:12:52.114
How do you know who I am?

101
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.192
I work in Washington, too.

102
00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:55.948
Washington?
So, you're a politician's wife?


103
00:12:56.027 --> 00:12:57.654
Yes, I am.

104
00:12:57.862 --> 00:12:59.739
Well, come on then.
Who's your husband?


105
00:13:06.412 --> 00:13:09.586
- So, what does your husband do?
- Nothing.


106
00:13:09.707 --> 00:13:11.084
Nothing?

107
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.880
Well, he just lies around
on his back all day.


108
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:16.339
Sounds like hard work to me.

109
00:13:21.052 --> 00:13:22.474
I'm sorry.

110
00:13:24.514 --> 00:13:26.357
I'm afraid I'm a little bit accident-prone.

111
00:13:26.432 --> 00:13:27.900
Watch it.

112
00:13:31.437 --> 00:13:32.780
Excusez-moi.

113
00:13:45.368 --> 00:13:47.496
My, oh.

114
00:13:47.745 --> 00:13:51.875
Mmm. This is one of my favorite recipes.

115
00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:53.501
I know, madam.

116
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.891
So, what do you do in Washington D.C.,
Mr. Green?


117
00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:02.890
Come on. What do you do?

118
00:14:02.969 --> 00:14:06.064
I mean, how are we to get acquainted if
we don't say anything about ourselves?


119
00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:08.140
Perhaps he doesn't want to get
acquainted with you.


120
00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:09.609
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

121
00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:11.732
But if I wasn't trying to keep
the conversation going,


122
00:14:11.811 --> 00:14:14.655
then we would just be sitting here in
an embarrassed silence.


123
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.153
Are you afraid of silence, Mrs. Peacock?

124
00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:18.780
Yes... No, why?

125
00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:20.736
Just seems to me that
you seem to suffer


126
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.914
from what we call "pressure of speech."

127
00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:25.208
"We"? Who's "we"? 
Are you a shrink?

128
00:14:25.283 --> 00:14:27.877
I do know a little bit about
psychological medicine, yes.


129
00:14:27.994 --> 00:14:30.122
You're a doctor?

130
00:14:30.204 --> 00:14:31.797
I am, but I don't practice.

131
00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:33.294
Practice makes perfect.

132
00:14:33.374 --> 00:14:35.718
I think most men need a little practice,

133
00:14:35.793 --> 00:14:37.340
don't you, Mrs. Peacock?

134
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.093
What do you do, Professor?

135
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:41.048
I work for UNO,
the United Nations Organization.


136
00:14:41.132 --> 00:14:42.930
Another politician. Jesus!

137
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:47.810
No, I work for a branch of UNO. WHO,
the World Health Organization.


138
00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:49.936
Well, what's your area
of special concern?


139
00:14:50.016 --> 00:14:51.893
Family planning.

140
00:14:51.976 --> 00:14:54.024
What about you, Colonel,
are you a real colonel?


141
00:14:54.103 --> 00:14:55.525
I am, sir.

142
00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:56.948
You're not gonna mention
the coincidence


143
00:14:57.023 --> 00:14:59.697
that you also live in Washington, D.C.?

144
00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:01.277
How did you know that?

145
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.987
Have we met before?

146
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.697
I've certainly seen you before,

147
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.078
although you may not have seen me.

148
00:15:07.158 --> 00:15:09.411
So, Miss Scarlet, does this mean that
you live in Washington, too?


149
00:15:09.493 --> 00:15:10.460
Sure do.

150
00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:13.460
Does anyone here
not live in Washington D.C.?


151
00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:14.711
I don't.

152
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.543
Yes, but you work for the United
Nations. That's a government job.


153
00:15:18.628 --> 00:15:20.301
And the rest of us all live in
a government town.


154
00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:22.928
Anyone here not earn their living from
the government, one way or another?


155
00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:26.553
Wadsworth, where's our host,
and why have we been brought here?


156
00:15:33.768 --> 00:15:36.442
Good evening.
You're eagerly awaited.


157
00:15:37.897 --> 00:15:40.116
Are you locking me in?
I'll take the key.


158
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:41.613
Over my dead body, sir.

159
00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:42.864
May I take your bag?

160
00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.490
No. I'll leave it
here 'till I need it.

161
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.538
It contains evidence,
I presume?


162
00:15:46.614 --> 00:15:49.413
It contains surprises, my friend.
That's what it contains, surprises.


163
00:15:51.327 --> 00:15:54.251
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present Mr. Boddy.


164
00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:57.125
What are they all doing here?

165
00:15:57.208 --> 00:15:58.710
Eating dinner.

166
00:15:58.793 --> 00:16:00.841
Do sit down, Mr. Boddy.

167
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.092
Thanks.

168
00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:06.763
No, you can take that away, honey.

169
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:15.564
Look! I demand to know
what's going on.


170
00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:18.647
Now, why have we all been dragged
out here to this horrible place?


171
00:16:18.729 --> 00:16:21.903
Well, I believe we all received a letter.

172
00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:23.325
My letter says,

173
00:16:23.401 --> 00:16:26.655
"it will be to your advantage
to be present on this date.


174
00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:30.537
"Because Mr. Boddy will bring to an end
a certain long-standing, confidential,


175
00:16:30.616 --> 00:16:33.290
"and painful financial liability."

176
00:16:33.536 --> 00:16:34.833
It is signed, "A friend."

177
00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:36.380
I received a similar letter.

178
00:16:36.455 --> 00:16:37.581
So did we. Didn't we?

179
00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:40.088
I also received a letter.

180
00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:43.011
No, thanks, Yvette. I just ate.

181
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:44.631
Now how did you know her name?

182
00:16:44.797 --> 00:16:46.515
We know each other.

183
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:47.967
Don't we, dear?

184
00:16:49.135 --> 00:16:52.230
Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Boddy,
but did your letter say the same thing?


185
00:16:52.304 --> 00:16:54.557
- No.
- I see.


186
00:16:56.976 --> 00:16:59.980
Can I interest any of you
in fruit or dessert?


187
00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:05.076
In that case, may I suggest
we adjourn to the study


188
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:07.199
for coffee and brandy,

189
00:17:07.278 --> 00:17:10.657
at which point I believe our unknown
host will reveal his intentions.


190
00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:15.873
There's no one here.

191
00:17:15.953 --> 00:17:19.878
Please help yourself to brandy
and be seated.


192
00:17:29.425 --> 00:17:31.348
Mind if I smoke?

193
00:17:50.488 --> 00:17:51.956
Ladies and gentlemen,

194
00:17:52.031 --> 00:17:55.956
I'm instructed to explain to you what
you all have in common with each other.


195
00:17:56.035 --> 00:17:58.709
Unless you would care to do the honors,
Mr. Boddy?


196
00:17:58.788 --> 00:18:01.166
Why me? Do they know who I am?

197
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.793
I don't think so. You've never identified
yourself to them, I believe.


198
00:18:03.876 --> 00:18:06.425
It's a hoax. I suggest we all leave.

199
00:18:06.504 --> 00:18:08.802
I'm sorry, sir.
You cannot leave this house!


200
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:10.258
No? Who's gonna stop me?

201
00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:13.101
There's no way out.
All the windows have bars.


202
00:18:13.177 --> 00:18:14.520
All the doors are locked.

203
00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:15.972
This is an outrage.
You can't hold us prisoner!


204
00:18:17.223 --> 00:18:18.315
He's right!

205
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.734
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
Please return to the study.


206
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.357
Everything will be explained.

207
00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:25.652
You, too, Mr. Boddy.

208
00:18:25.731 --> 00:18:27.199
Other way!

209
00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:37.125
You can't get out that way.

210
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.418
Why not? It's only glass.

211
00:19:02.268 --> 00:19:05.067
Ladies and gentlemen,
you all have one thing in common.


212
00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.738
You're all being blackmailed.

213
00:19:06.814 --> 00:19:08.782
For some considerable time,

214
00:19:08.858 --> 00:19:10.485
all of you have been paying
what you can afford,


215
00:19:10.568 --> 00:19:12.241
and in some cases
more than you can afford,


216
00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.617
to someone who
threatens to expose you,


217
00:19:14.697 --> 00:19:17.450
and none of you know who's
blackmailing you. Do you?


218
00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:19.702
Please! I've never heard anything
so ridiculous!


219
00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:21.253
Nobody could blackmail me.

220
00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:24.127
My life is an open book.
I've never done anything wrong.


221
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:29.136
Anybody else wish to deny it?

222
00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:34.929
Very well.

223
00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:36.932
As everyone here is in the same boat,

224
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:38.729
there's no harm in my revealing
some details.


225
00:19:38.804 --> 00:19:40.556
And my instructions are to do so.

226
00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:41.856
Thank you, Yvette.

227
00:19:49.148 --> 00:19:52.118
Don't you think you might
spare us this humiliation.


228
00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.160
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.616
Professor Plum, you were once
a professor of psychiatry,


230
00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:01.623
specializing in helping paranoid
and homicidal lunatics


231
00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:03.079
suffering from delusions of grandeur.

232
00:20:03.162 --> 00:20:04.630
Yes, but now I work for
the United Nations.


233
00:20:04.705 --> 00:20:07.629
No, your work has not changed. But
you don't practice medicine at the UN.


234
00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:10.882
His license to practice has been lifted.
Correct?


235
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:12.588
Why? What did he do?

236
00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.799
You know what doctors aren't allowed to
do with their lady patients?


237
00:20:14.882 --> 00:20:16.429
- Yeah.
- Well, he did.


238
00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.510
How disgusting!

239
00:20:18.594 --> 00:20:22.019
Are you making moral judgments,
Mrs. Peacock?


240
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:25.351
How then do you justify taking bribes

241
00:20:25.434 --> 00:20:27.107
in return for delivering your husband.

242
00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:28.733
Senator Peacock's vote
to certain lobbyists?


243
00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:31.782
My husband's a paid consultant.
There's nothing wrong with that.


244
00:20:31.857 --> 00:20:34.781
Not if it's publicly declared, perhaps.

245
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.907
But if the payment is delivered by

246
00:20:35.986 --> 00:20:37.954
slipping used greenbacks
in plain envelopes


247
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.783
under the door of the men's room, how
would you describe that transaction?


248
00:20:40.866 --> 00:20:41.833
I'd say it stinks.

249
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:43.286
How would you know?
When were you in that men's room?


250
00:20:43.369 --> 00:20:44.336
So it's true?

251
00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.834
No. It's a vicious lie!

252
00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:48.757
I'm sure we're all glad to hear that.

253
00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.334
But you've been paying
blackmail for over a year now


254
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.341
to keep that story out of the papers.

255
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.422
Well, I am willing to believe you.

256
00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.800
I, too, am being blackmailed
for something I didn't do.


257
00:20:57.883 --> 00:20:59.305
- Me, too.
- And me.


258
00:20:59.385 --> 00:21:01.058
- Not me.
- You're not being blackmailed?


259
00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:05.228
I'm being blackmailed all right.
But I did what I'm being blackmailed for.


260
00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:06.729
What did you do?

261
00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:08.231
To be perfectly frank,

262
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.314
I run a specialized hotel and a
telephone service which provides


263
00:21:11.397 --> 00:21:14.401
gentlemen with the company
of a young lady for a short while.


264
00:21:14.525 --> 00:21:15.993
Yeah?

265
00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:18.912
What's the phone number?

266
00:21:19.113 --> 00:21:21.161
So how did you know
Colonel Mustard works in Washington?


267
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.537
Is he one of your clients?

268
00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:24.289
- Certainly not.
- I was asking Miss Scarlet.


269
00:21:24.368 --> 00:21:25.745
Well, you tell them it's not true.

270
00:21:25.828 --> 00:21:26.920
It's not true.

271
00:21:26.996 --> 00:21:28.498
- Is that true?
- No, it's not true.


272
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.799
- Aha! So it is true!
- A double negative.


273
00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:32.547
A double negative?
Do you mean you have photographs?


274
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.133
That sounds like a confession to me.
In fact, the double negative


275
00:21:35.212 --> 00:21:37.306
has led to proof positive.
I'm afraid you gave yourself away.


276
00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:39.930
Are you trying to make me look stupid
in front of the other guests?


277
00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:41.261
You don't need any help from me, sir.

278
00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.016
That's right!

279
00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:46.019
Seriously, I don't see what's so terrible
about Colonel Mustard


280
00:21:46.098 --> 00:21:49.022
visiting a house of ill fame.
Most soldiers do, don't they?


281
00:21:49.101 --> 00:21:50.353
Please.

282
00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:53.360
But he holds a sensitive security post
in the Pentagon.


283
00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:55.407
And, Colonel,
you drive a very expensive car


284
00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:57.359
for someone who lives
on a colonel's pay.


285
00:21:57.443 --> 00:22:00.322
I don't. I came into money during the
war when I lost my mommy and daddy.


286
00:22:03.532 --> 00:22:06.376
Mrs. White, you've been paying our
friend the blackmailer


287
00:22:06.452 --> 00:22:09.706
ever since your husband died under,
shall we say, mysterious circumstances.


288
00:22:11.623 --> 00:22:12.966
Why is that funny?

289
00:22:13.042 --> 00:22:16.421
I see. That's why he was lying
on his back. In his coffin.


290
00:22:16.587 --> 00:22:18.180
I didn't kill him.

291
00:22:18.255 --> 00:22:19.882
Then why are you
paying the blackmailer?


292
00:22:19.965 --> 00:22:21.808
I don't want a scandal, do I?

293
00:22:21.884 --> 00:22:24.728
We had had a very
humiliating public confrontation.


294
00:22:24.845 --> 00:22:27.189
He was deranged. 
He was a lunatic.

295
00:22:27.306 --> 00:22:30.355
He didn't actually seem to
like me very much.


296
00:22:30.434 --> 00:22:31.981
He threatened to kill me in public.

297
00:22:32.061 --> 00:22:33.483
Why would he want
to kill you in public?

298
00:22:33.562 --> 00:22:36.031
I think she meant
he threatened in public to kill her.


299
00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:38.700
Was that his final word on the matter?

300
00:22:38.776 --> 00:22:41.154
Being killed is pretty final,
wouldn't you say?


301
00:22:41.236 --> 00:22:44.706
And yet, he was the one who died.
Not you, Mrs. White. Not you.


302
00:22:44.782 --> 00:22:46.375
What did he do for a living?

303
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.296
He was a scientist. 
Nuclear physics.

304
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.372
What was he like?

305
00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:55.084
He was always
a rather stupidly optimistic man.


306
00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:57.636
I mean, I'm afraid It came as a great
shock to him when he died.


307
00:22:57.711 --> 00:22:59.713
But he was found dead at home.
His head had been cut off.


308
00:22:59.797 --> 00:23:01.765
And so had his...

309
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.217
You know.

310
00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:06.895
I had been out
all evening at the movies.

311
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.017
Do you miss him?

312
00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.855
Well, it's a matter of life after death.
Now that he's dead, I have a life.


313
00:23:11.934 --> 00:23:13.311
But he was your second husband.

314
00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:15.316
Your first husband also disappeared.

315
00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:17.864
But that was his job.
He was an illusionist.


316
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.112
But he never reappeared.

317
00:23:19.191 --> 00:23:21.364
He wasn't a very good illusionist.

318
00:23:22.194 --> 00:23:24.663
I have something to say.

319
00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:29.660
I'm not gonna wait for Wadsworth
here to unmask me.


320
00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:32.166
I work for the State Department,

321
00:23:32.246 --> 00:23:33.543
and I'm a homosexual.

322
00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:40.175
I feel no personal shame
or guilt about this,


323
00:23:40.254 --> 00:23:45.101
but I must keep it a secret
or I'll lose my job on security grounds.


324
00:23:47.261 --> 00:23:48.729
Thank you.

325
00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:53.233
Well,

326
00:23:54.893 --> 00:23:57.772
that just leaves Mr. Boddy.

327
00:23:57.855 --> 00:23:59.198
What's your little secret?

328
00:23:59.273 --> 00:24:01.150
His secret? Haven't you guessed?

329
00:24:01.233 --> 00:24:03.110
He's the one who's blackmailing you.

330
00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:05.871
You bastard!

331
00:24:05.946 --> 00:24:08.745
Put 'em up!

332
00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:10.909
Gentlemen,

333
00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:15.205
if you can't fight
fairly, don't fight at all.

334
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:17.758
Nobody calls me a bastard!

335
00:24:19.168 --> 00:24:21.216
Was that necessary,
Mrs. White?


336
00:24:21.295 --> 00:24:22.467
WADSWORTH Wait, wait!

337
00:24:22.588 --> 00:24:24.511
The police are coming.

338
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.558
- No, no!
- No!


339
00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:28.180
Listen!

340
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.183
Blackmail depends on secrecy.

341
00:24:30.262 --> 00:24:32.185
You've all admitted how
he's been able to blackmail you.


342
00:24:32.264 --> 00:24:33.607
All you have to
do is tell the police,

343
00:24:33.682 --> 00:24:35.684
he'll be convicted
and your troubles will be over.


344
00:24:35.767 --> 00:24:37.440
It's not so easy.

345
00:24:39.396 --> 00:24:41.194
You'll never tell the police.

346
00:24:41.273 --> 00:24:43.526
Then I shall.
I have evidence in my possession.


347
00:24:43.609 --> 00:24:46.078
And this conversation
is being tape recorded.


348
00:24:46.153 --> 00:24:47.370
Point of order.

349
00:24:47.446 --> 00:24:50.199
Tape recordings aren't
admissible evidence.


350
00:24:50.282 --> 00:24:54.378
Ladies and gentlemen, the police
will be here in about 45 minutes.


351
00:24:54.453 --> 00:24:55.670
Tell them the truth,

352
00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:59.462
and Mr. Boddy will be behind bars.

353
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:01.293
Where are you going this time?

354
00:25:01.376 --> 00:25:03.219
I think I can help them
make up their minds.


355
00:25:03.295 --> 00:25:04.968
Can I just get my little bag
from the hall?


356
00:25:14.806 --> 00:25:17.730
Who can guess
what's in here?


357
00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:20.232
The evidence against us, no doubt.

358
00:25:20.312 --> 00:25:21.905
We didn't know we were
meeting you tonight.


359
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.981
Did you know you were meeting us?

360
00:25:23.065 --> 00:25:24.157
Yes.

361
00:25:24.274 --> 00:25:26.447
What were you told, precisely?

362
00:25:26.526 --> 00:25:27.994
Merely, that you were all meeting to

363
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.697
discuss our little
financial arrangements.


364
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.703
And if I didn't appear,

365
00:25:31.782 --> 00:25:34.376
Wadsworth would be informing
the police about it all.


366
00:25:35.077 --> 00:25:39.002
Naturally, I could hardly resist
putting in an appearance.


367
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:41.587
Excuse me.

368
00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:43.756
Open them.

369
00:25:45.295 --> 00:25:46.717
Why not?

370
00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:52.724
I enjoy getting presents
from strange men.


371
00:26:01.353 --> 00:26:03.230
A candlestick?

372
00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:05.236
What's this for?

373
00:26:50.986 --> 00:26:54.741
In your hands,
you each have a lethal weapon.


374
00:26:58.076 --> 00:27:00.499
If you denounce me to the police,

375
00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:03.833
you will also be
exposed and humiliated.


376
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:07.169
I'll see to that in court.

377
00:27:08.086 --> 00:27:11.511
But if one of you kills Wadsworth now,

378
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.639
no one but the seven
of us will ever know.


379
00:27:17.179 --> 00:27:19.648
He has the key to the front door,

380
00:27:19.723 --> 00:27:24.274
which he said would only be opened
over his dead body.


381
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.911
I suggest we take
him up on that offer.

382
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:40.836
The only way to avoid finding yourselves
on the front pages,


383
00:27:40.911 --> 00:27:45.007
is for one of
you to kill Wadsworth now.

384
00:27:56.635 --> 00:27:58.683
- It's not Wadsworth!
- Is he alive?


385
00:27:58.762 --> 00:27:59.809
Mr. Boddy.

386
00:27:59.888 --> 00:28:01.390
Stand back! Give him air!

387
00:28:01.473 --> 00:28:02.850
Let me see.

388
00:28:09.272 --> 00:28:10.694
He's dead!

389
00:28:10.774 --> 00:28:13.698
- Who had the gun?
- I did.


390
00:28:13.777 --> 00:28:15.450
- Then you shot him!
- I didn't!


391
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:17.952
Well, you had the gun.
If you didn't shoot him, who did?


392
00:28:19.783 --> 00:28:21.831
Nobody! Look.
There's no gunshot wound.


393
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.210
Somebody tried to grab the gun from
me in the dark and the gun went off.


394
00:28:25.288 --> 00:28:27.586
Look! The bullet broke that vase
on the mantle.


395
00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:29.626
Sorry. Excuse me.

396
00:28:30.877 --> 00:28:34.598
He's absolutely right. Look, there's a
bullet hole here in the wall. See that?


397
00:28:34.673 --> 00:28:37.222
- How did he die?
- I don't know!


398
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.098
I'm not a forensic expert!

399
00:28:39.177 --> 00:28:41.225
One of us must have killed him.

400
00:28:41.304 --> 00:28:42.726
I didn't do it.

401
00:28:42.806 --> 00:28:44.729
I need a drink.

402
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.272
Maybe he was poisoned.

403
00:28:50.355 --> 00:28:51.447
Aah!

404
00:28:53.483 --> 00:28:54.575
Aah!

405
00:28:54.734 --> 00:28:56.657
Mrs. Peacock, it's all right.

406
00:28:56.736 --> 00:28:58.659
We don't know anything.

407
00:28:58.738 --> 00:29:00.911
Sit down. Sit down.

408
00:29:02.492 --> 00:29:05.541
I had to stop her from screaming.

409
00:29:07.038 --> 00:29:09.006
Was the brandy poisoned?

410
00:29:09.082 --> 00:29:10.550
I don't know.

411
00:29:13.253 --> 00:29:15.176
Looks like we'll never know.

412
00:29:15.255 --> 00:29:16.677
Unless...

413
00:29:16.756 --> 00:29:18.724
Unless she dies, too.

414
00:29:35.275 --> 00:29:36.697
It's locked.

415
00:29:36.776 --> 00:29:38.198
Open up...

416
00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:39.700
- It must be the murderer!
- Why would he scream?


417
00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:41.201
He must have a victim in there.

418
00:29:41.281 --> 00:29:43.124
- My God! Yvette!
- My God!


419
00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:48.046
You're alive.

420
00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:49.543
- No thanks to you.
- What do you mean?


421
00:29:49.623 --> 00:29:51.751
You locked me up with a murderer,
you idiot!


422
00:29:51.833 --> 00:29:53.676
So the murderer is in this room?

423
00:29:53.752 --> 00:29:55.095
But where?

424
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.763
Where? Here.

425
00:29:56.838 --> 00:29:59.842
We're all looking at him or her!

426
00:29:59.925 --> 00:30:02.098
It's what Mrs. 
White said in the study,

427
00:30:02.177 --> 00:30:03.679
one of you is the killer!

428
00:30:03.762 --> 00:30:05.309
How did you know we said that?

429
00:30:05.388 --> 00:30:06.514
I was listening.

430
00:30:06.598 --> 00:30:09.693
Why were you screaming in here
all by yourself?


431
00:30:09.768 --> 00:30:11.691
Because I am frightened. Me, too.

432
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.693
I also drink the cognac. Mon Dieu!

433
00:30:13.772 --> 00:30:16.150
I can't stay here by myself.

434
00:30:19.152 --> 00:30:20.699
Come back to the study with us.

435
00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:22.201
With the murderer?

436
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.783
There's safety in numbers, my dear.

437
00:30:38.797 --> 00:30:41.721
There's no indication of how he died?

438
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.222
- No.
- This is terrible.


439
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:44.723
This is absolutely terrible.

440
00:30:44.803 --> 00:30:46.726
It's not what I'd intended.

441
00:30:46.805 --> 00:30:47.931
My God!

442
00:30:48.014 --> 00:30:49.391
Not what you intended?

443
00:30:49.474 --> 00:30:51.397
So, you're not the butler?

444
00:30:51.476 --> 00:30:52.944
I'm not the butler,

445
00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:55.272
but I am a butler.
In fact, I was his butler.


446
00:30:55.355 --> 00:30:59.110
If he told you to invite us all to
his house, why did he arrive late?


447
00:30:59.192 --> 00:31:02.412
I invited you. In fact, 
I wrote the letters.

448
00:31:02.487 --> 00:31:03.659
It was all my idea.

449
00:31:03.738 --> 00:31:06.742
Wait a minute. 
I don't understand.

450
00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:09.749
Why did you invite us here
to meet your late employer?


451
00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:11.296
Were you assisting him
to blackmail us?


452
00:31:11.371 --> 00:31:12.748
Certainly not!

453
00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:14.925
I think you'd better explain.

454
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.219
Please sit down, everyone.

455
00:31:37.689 --> 00:31:39.987
When I said I was Mr. 
Boddy's butler,

456
00:31:40.066 --> 00:31:41.739
this was both true and misleading.

457
00:31:41.818 --> 00:31:43.741
I was once his butler,

458
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.367
but it was not his untimely death
this evening


459
00:31:45.447 --> 00:31:47.074
that brought my employment
with him to an end.


460
00:31:47.157 --> 00:31:48.625
When did it come to an end?

461
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.250
When my wife decided to end her life.

462
00:31:52.329 --> 00:31:55.003
She, too, was being blackmailed by
this odious man


463
00:31:55.081 --> 00:31:56.253
who now lies dead before us.

464
00:31:56.333 --> 00:31:58.256
He hated my wife

465
00:31:58.335 --> 00:32:01.305
for the same reason
he hated all of you.

466
00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:04.223
He believed that you were all
thoroughly un-American.


467
00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:09.187
I'm sorry.

468
00:32:09.262 --> 00:32:11.890
For some reason he felt that it
was inappropriate


469
00:32:11.973 --> 00:32:14.192
for a senator to have a corrupt wife,

470
00:32:14.267 --> 00:32:16.895
for a doctor to take advantage
of his patients,


471
00:32:16.978 --> 00:32:20.073
for a wife to emasculate her husband,

472
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:21.778
and so forth.

473
00:32:22.233 --> 00:32:23.234
But this is ridiculous.

474
00:32:23.318 --> 00:32:24.740
If he was such a patriotic American,

475
00:32:24.819 --> 00:32:25.991
why didn't he just report us
to the authorities?


476
00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:28.449
He decided to put his information
to good use


477
00:32:28.531 --> 00:32:29.657
and make a little money out of it.

478
00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:32.290
What could be
more American than that?


479
00:32:32.369 --> 00:32:33.791
What was your role in all this?

480
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.168
I was a victim, too.

481
00:32:36.247 --> 00:32:38.716
At least, my wife was.

482
00:32:39.084 --> 00:32:41.337
She had friends who were

483
00:32:43.421 --> 00:32:44.422
socialists.

484
00:32:44.506 --> 00:32:46.725
My God.

485
00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:54.187
Well, we all make mistakes.

486
00:33:05.235 --> 00:33:06.987
Mr. Boddy threatened to give
my wife's name


487
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.414
to the House Un-American Activities
Committee unless she named them.


488
00:33:09.489 --> 00:33:11.708
She refused, so he blackmailed her.

489
00:33:11.783 --> 00:33:14.707
We had no money.
And the price of his silence


490
00:33:14.786 --> 00:33:16.709
was that we work for him for nothing.
We were slaves.


491
00:33:16.788 --> 00:33:19.541
To make a long story short...

492
00:33:19.624 --> 00:33:20.716
Too late.

493
00:33:20.917 --> 00:33:23.215
The suicide of my wife
preyed on my mind


494
00:33:23.294 --> 00:33:26.013
and created a sense of injustice in me.

495
00:33:26.089 --> 00:33:28.717
I resolved to put Mr. 
Boddy behind bars.

496
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.427
It seemed to me the
best way to do it

497
00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.138
and to free all of you from the same
burden of blackmail


498
00:33:33.221 --> 00:33:35.815
was to get everyone face to face,

499
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.393
confront Mr. Boddy with his crimes,

500
00:33:38.476 --> 00:33:40.979
and then turn him over to the police.

501
00:33:41.104 --> 00:33:42.401
So, everything's explained.

502
00:33:44.107 --> 00:33:46.360
Nothing's explained.
We still don't know who killed him.


503
00:33:46.443 --> 00:33:49.868
The point is we've got to find out in the
next 39 minutes before the police arrive.


504
00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:52.574
My God. We can't have them
come here now.


505
00:33:52.657 --> 00:33:55.581
But how can we possibly find out
which of you did it?


506
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.957
What do you mean,
"which of you did it"?


507
00:33:57.036 --> 00:33:58.253
Well, I didn't do it!

508
00:33:58.329 --> 00:34:01.458
Well, one of us did. We all had the
opportunity. We all had a motive.


509
00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:03.088
Great! We'll all go to the chair.

510
00:34:03.168 --> 00:34:05.136
- Maybe it wasn't one of us!
- Who else could it have been?


511
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:06.258
Who else is in the house?

512
00:34:06.337 --> 00:34:07.429
- Only the cook!
- Only the cook!


513
00:34:07.505 --> 00:34:08.506
- The cook!
- The cook!


514
00:34:38.286 --> 00:34:41.631
Well, she's not here.

515
00:34:41.706 --> 00:34:42.878
Aah!

516
00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:47.258
I didn't do it!

517
00:34:47.337 --> 00:34:51.342
Somebody help me, please.

518
00:34:57.847 --> 00:34:59.269
- Don't touch it.

519
00:34:59.349 --> 00:35:00.771
That's evidence.

520
00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.318
Not for us.
We have to find out who did this.


521
00:35:02.393 --> 00:35:04.441
We can't take fingerprints.

522
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:06.694
I think you'd better
explain yourself, Wadsworth.


523
00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:08.070
Me? Why me?

524
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:09.696
Who would want to kill the cook?

525
00:35:09.776 --> 00:35:10.777
Dinner wasn't that bad.

526
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.204
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?


527
00:35:13.279 --> 00:35:14.872
It's my defense mechanism.

528
00:35:14.948 --> 00:35:18.498
Some defense.
If I was the killer, I'd kill you next.


529
00:35:18.576 --> 00:35:22.080
I said "if." If.

530
00:35:23.998 --> 00:35:26.547
Hey, come on. There's only one
admitted killer here.


531
00:35:26.626 --> 00:35:27.923
And it is certainly
not me. It is her.

532
00:35:28.002 --> 00:35:29.470
I've admitted nothing.

533
00:35:29.546 --> 00:35:31.514
Well, you paid the blackmail.
How many husbands have you had?


534
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:33.011
Mine or other women's?

535
00:35:33.091 --> 00:35:34.092
- Yours.
- Five.


536
00:35:34.175 --> 00:35:35.347
- Five?
- Yes. Just the five.


537
00:35:35.426 --> 00:35:37.349
Husbands should be like Kleenex,

538
00:35:37.428 --> 00:35:38.771
soft, strong, and disposable.

539
00:35:38.847 --> 00:35:41.771
You lure men to their deaths like
a spider with flies.


540
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.523
Flies are where men
are most vulnerable.


541
00:35:43.601 --> 00:35:44.602
Right.

542
00:35:44.769 --> 00:35:47.693
Well, if it wasn't
you, then who was it?

543
00:35:47.772 --> 00:35:49.194
Who had the dagger, anyway?

544
00:35:49.274 --> 00:35:50.696
It was you, Mrs. 
Peacock, wasn't it?

545
00:35:50.775 --> 00:35:52.402
Yes. But I put it down.

546
00:35:52.485 --> 00:35:53.532
- Where?
- In the study.


547
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:54.737
- When?
- I don't know.


548
00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:57.370
Before I fainted, or after I fainted...

549
00:35:57.448 --> 00:36:00.873
I don't know! But any of you
could have picked it up.


550
00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:05.670
Look. I suggest we take the cook's body
into the study.


551
00:36:05.748 --> 00:36:06.795
Why?

552
00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:10.049
I'm the butler.
I like to keep the kitchen tidy.


553
00:36:16.301 --> 00:36:17.723
- Look!
- What?


554
00:36:17.802 --> 00:36:19.896
The body's gone!

555
00:36:19.971 --> 00:36:21.063
What are you all staring at?

556
00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:22.106
Nothing.

557
00:36:22.181 --> 00:36:23.649
- Well, who's there?
- Nobody.


558
00:36:23.725 --> 00:36:25.193
- What do you mean?
- Nobody.


559
00:36:25.268 --> 00:36:27.817
No body, that's what we mean.
Mr. Boddy's body's gone.


560
00:36:28.271 --> 00:36:29.523
- Maybe he wasn't dead.
- He was!


561
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:30.983
We should've made sure.

562
00:36:31.065 --> 00:36:32.408
How? By cutting his head off,
I suppose?


563
00:36:32.483 --> 00:36:34.110
- That was uncalled for.
- Where is he?


564
00:36:34.193 --> 00:36:36.616
We'd better look for him.

565
00:36:48.249 --> 00:36:52.174
Well, he couldn't have been dead.

566
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:55.257
He was. At least, 
I thought he was.

567
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.843
What difference does it make now?

568
00:36:57.926 --> 00:36:59.894
Makes quite a difference to him.

569
00:36:59.969 --> 00:37:02.848
Maybe there is life after death.

570
00:37:02.931 --> 00:37:04.854
Life after death's as improbable

571
00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:07.027
as sex after marriage.

572
00:37:07.143 --> 00:37:10.192
Maybe Mr. Boddy killed the cook!

573
00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:11.318
'Yes!
'Yes!


574
00:37:11.397 --> 00:37:13.024
How?

575
00:37:17.153 --> 00:37:18.530
I don't know.

576
00:37:18.696 --> 00:37:21.950
Well, if you'll excuse me. I have to...

577
00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:25.412
- ls there a little girl's room in the hall?
- Oui.oui. Madame.


578
00:37:25.703 --> 00:37:29.173
No, I just want to powder my nose.

579
00:37:31.042 --> 00:37:32.339
What's this, Wadsworth?

580
00:37:32.418 --> 00:37:35.843
I'm afraid those are the negatives to
which Colonel Mustard earlier referred.


581
00:37:35.922 --> 00:37:36.923
My God.

582
00:37:37.048 --> 00:37:38.345
Were you planning to blackmail him,
Wadsworth?


583
00:37:38.424 --> 00:37:41.223
Certainly not.
I'd obtained them for the colonel


584
00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:42.349
and I was going to give them back

585
00:37:42.428 --> 00:37:44.351
as soon as Mr. 
Boddy was unmasked.

586
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.151
Very pretty. Would you like to see
these, Yvette? They might shock you.


587
00:37:48.226 --> 00:37:49.819
No, merci. I am a lady.

588
00:37:49.894 --> 00:37:52.147
How do you know what kind of
pictures they are if you're such a lady?


589
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.322
What sort of pictures are they?

590
00:37:53.398 --> 00:37:55.025
They're my pictures and
I'd like them back please.


591
00:37:55.108 --> 00:37:57.531
No. I'm afraid there's something in
them that concerns me, too.


592
00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.032
Let me see.

593
00:37:59.112 --> 00:38:02.036
My.
Nobody can get into that position.


594
00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:03.537
Sure they can.

595
00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:05.539
Let me show you.

596
00:38:05.618 --> 00:38:07.086
Get off me.

597
00:38:07.203 --> 00:38:08.204
Aah!

598
00:38:15.753 --> 00:38:17.005
It's Mr. Boddy!

599
00:38:17.088 --> 00:38:19.011
He's attacking her.

600
00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.091
Aah!

601
00:38:23.469 --> 00:38:25.392
No. No, he's dead.

602
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:27.769
Mr. Boddy. Dead again!

603
00:38:27.849 --> 00:38:29.066
My God.

604
00:38:29.142 --> 00:38:30.564
She's going to faint.

605
00:38:30.643 --> 00:38:32.065
Somebody catch her!

606
00:38:32.145 --> 00:38:33.818
I'll catch her.
Fall into my arms.


607
00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:36.824
Sorry.

608
00:38:36.899 --> 00:38:38.276
You've got blood on your hands.

609
00:38:39.736 --> 00:38:41.613
I didn't do it!

610
00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:46.243
He's got new injuries.
Well, he's certainly dead now.


611
00:38:46.325 --> 00:38:48.453
Why would anyone
want to kill him twice?


612
00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:49.879
Seems so unnecessary.

613
00:38:49.954 --> 00:38:51.126
That's what we call overkill.

614
00:38:51.205 --> 00:38:52.331
What we call psychotic.

615
00:38:52.415 --> 00:38:54.133
Unless he wasn't dead before.

616
00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:55.630
What's the difference?

617
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.133
That's what we're trying to find out!
We're trying to find out


618
00:38:58.212 --> 00:39:00.635
who killed him, and where,
and with what!


619
00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:01.967
There's no need to shout!

620
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.303
I'm not shouting!

621
00:39:04.927 --> 00:39:06.554
All right, lam!

622
00:39:06.637 --> 00:39:09.516
I'm shouting! I'm shouting! I'm...

623
00:39:20.443 --> 00:39:23.617
Okay, put the corpses on the sofa.

624
00:39:24.655 --> 00:39:26.077
Ladies first.

625
00:39:38.503 --> 00:39:40.471
Careful. Don't get blood on the sofa.

626
00:39:40.546 --> 00:39:43.675
How do we do this?
The dagger will go further into her back.


627
00:39:43.883 --> 00:39:45.476
Tip her forward over the arm.

628
00:39:50.807 --> 00:39:52.309
Now Mr. Boddy.

629
00:39:54.352 --> 00:39:55.524
Ready.

630
00:39:58.356 --> 00:39:59.778
A little higher.

631
00:39:59.857 --> 00:40:01.279
There we go.

632
00:40:05.363 --> 00:40:07.741
Now. Who...

633
00:40:08.866 --> 00:40:11.415
Who had access to the candlestick?

634
00:40:11.494 --> 00:40:13.462
- All of us.
- It was given to you.


635
00:40:13.538 --> 00:40:14.960
Yeah, but I dropped it on the table.

636
00:40:15.039 --> 00:40:17.212
Anyone could've picked it up. You, him.

637
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:19.134
Look. We still have these weapons,

638
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.305
the gun, the rope, the wrench,
the lead pipe.


639
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.805
Let's put them all in this cupboard
and lock it.


640
00:40:25.883 --> 00:40:28.056
There's a homicidal maniac about.

641
00:40:28.136 --> 00:40:29.683
- Good idea.
- Good idea.


642
00:40:30.388 --> 00:40:32.231
- What are you doing with the key?
- Putting it in my pocket.


643
00:40:32.306 --> 00:40:33.899
- Why?
- To keep it safe, obviously.


644
00:40:33.975 --> 00:40:36.444
That means that you can
open it whenever you want.


645
00:40:36.519 --> 00:40:38.863
- But it also means that you can't.
- What if you're the murderer?


646
00:40:38.938 --> 00:40:39.985
I'm not.

647
00:40:40.064 --> 00:40:41.281
But what if you are?

648
00:40:41.357 --> 00:40:43.780
Well, it's got to be put somewhere.
If I've got it, I know I'm safe.


649
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.954
We don't know that we are.

650
00:40:46.028 --> 00:40:47.951
I've an idea. We'll throw it away.

651
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.077
Good idea!

652
00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:50.409
- Wonderful!
- Right away! Brilliant.


653
00:40:55.913 --> 00:40:57.085
Sorry.

654
00:40:58.916 --> 00:41:00.543
Sorry.

655
00:41:00.626 --> 00:41:02.094
Can we help?

656
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.049
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb
the whole household,


657
00:41:05.131 --> 00:41:08.010
but my car broke down out here

658
00:41:08.092 --> 00:41:11.016
and I was wondering
if I could use your phone.


659
00:41:11.095 --> 00:41:12.472
Just a moment please.

660
00:41:26.694 --> 00:41:28.196
Very well, sir.

661
00:41:28.279 --> 00:41:30.373
Would you care to come in?

662
00:41:30.907 --> 00:41:32.329
Well, where is it?

663
00:41:32.408 --> 00:41:33.830
What, the body?

664
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:35.332
The phone. What body?

665
00:41:35.411 --> 00:41:37.834
There's no body. Nobody.
There's nobody in the study.


666
00:41:37.914 --> 00:41:39.336
- No!
- No!


667
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.837
But I think there's
a phone in the lounge.

668
00:41:40.917 --> 00:41:42.294
Thank you.

669
00:41:48.925 --> 00:41:52.896
When you've finished your call, perhaps
you'd be good enough to wait here.


670
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.472
Certainly.

671
00:42:06.817 --> 00:42:07.864
Aah!

672
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:09.570
Where's the key?

673
00:42:09.654 --> 00:42:10.871
In my pocket.

674
00:42:10.947 --> 00:42:12.199
Not that key. The key to the cupboard.

675
00:42:12.281 --> 00:42:14.329
- With the weapons.
- Do you still wish me to throw it away?


676
00:42:14.408 --> 00:42:15.409
'Yes!
'Yes!


677
00:42:28.464 --> 00:42:31.388
Well, what now?

678
00:42:31.467 --> 00:42:32.889
Wadsworth, let me out.

679
00:42:32.969 --> 00:42:34.391
- No.
- Why not?


680
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.268
We've got to know who did it.
We're all in this together now.


681
00:42:36.347 --> 00:42:38.691
If you leave,
I'll say that you killed them both.


682
00:42:38.766 --> 00:42:40.894
- Me, too.
- Me, too.


683
00:42:40.977 --> 00:42:42.900
Wadsworth, I'll make you sorry
you ever started this.


684
00:42:42.979 --> 00:42:44.902
One day, when we're alone together...

685
00:42:44.981 --> 00:42:48.485
Mrs. White, no man in his right mind
would be alone together with you.


686
00:42:48.567 --> 00:42:50.490
Well, I could use a drink.

687
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:51.991
So could I.

688
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:53.493
Just checking.

689
00:42:53.572 --> 00:42:54.789
Everything all right?

690
00:42:54.865 --> 00:42:57.209
Yep. Two corpses. 
Everything's fine.

691
00:43:00.288 --> 00:43:01.540
Anybody else want a whiskey?

692
00:43:01.622 --> 00:43:02.669
Yeah.

693
00:43:04.208 --> 00:43:05.630
All right, look.

694
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.553
Pay attention, everybody.

695
00:43:09.005 --> 00:43:12.430
Wadsworth, am I right in thinking
there's nobody else in this house?


696
00:43:12.508 --> 00:43:13.600
No.

697
00:43:13.676 --> 00:43:15.303
Then there is someone else
in this house?


698
00:43:15.386 --> 00:43:17.935
- No, sorry. I said "no" meaning yes.
- "No" meaning yes?


699
00:43:18.014 --> 00:43:19.937
Look. I want a straight answer.

700
00:43:20.016 --> 00:43:23.771
Is there someone else or isn't there,
yes or no?


701
00:43:23.853 --> 00:43:24.945
No.

702
00:43:25.021 --> 00:43:26.819
No, there is,
or no there isn't?


703
00:43:26.897 --> 00:43:27.989
WADSWORTH Yes.

704
00:43:28.065 --> 00:43:29.738
Please!

705
00:43:30.818 --> 00:43:32.866
Don't you think we should get that man
out of the house


706
00:43:32.945 --> 00:43:34.913
before he finds out
what's been going on here?


707
00:43:34.989 --> 00:43:35.990
Yeah.

708
00:43:36.073 --> 00:43:37.916
How can we throw him outside
in this weather?


709
00:43:37.992 --> 00:43:40.336
If we let him stay in the house,
he may get suspicious.


710
00:43:40.411 --> 00:43:42.254
If we throw him out,
he may get even more suspicious.


711
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.128
If I were him, 
I'd be suspicious already.

712
00:43:44.206 --> 00:43:47.050
Who cares? That guy doesn't matter.

713
00:43:47.126 --> 00:43:49.754
Let him stay locked up
for another half hour.


714
00:43:49.837 --> 00:43:52.090
The police will be here by then,

715
00:43:52.173 --> 00:43:55.427
and there are two dead bodies
in the study!


716
00:43:57.803 --> 00:43:59.430
Well, there's still some confusion

717
00:43:59.513 --> 00:44:01.140
as to whether or not there's
anybody else in this house.


718
00:44:01.223 --> 00:44:02.520
I told you there isn't.

719
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.443
There isn't any confusion or
there isn't anybody else?


720
00:44:04.518 --> 00:44:06.941
- Either. Or both.
- Just give me a clear answer.


721
00:44:07.021 --> 00:44:10.446
- Certainly. What was the question?
- Ls there anybody else in the house?


722
00:44:10.524 --> 00:44:11.946
- No!
- No!


723
00:44:12.026 --> 00:44:15.872
That's what he says, but does he know?

724
00:44:15.946 --> 00:44:19.200
I suggest we handle this
in proper military fashion.


725
00:44:19.283 --> 00:44:21.456
We split up and search the house.

726
00:44:21.535 --> 00:44:22.582
Split Up?

727
00:44:22.661 --> 00:44:26.336
Yes. We have very little time left,
so we'll split up into pairs.


728
00:44:26.457 --> 00:44:27.424
- Pairs?
- Yes.


729
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.844
Wait a minute. Suppose that
one of us is the murderer.


730
00:44:29.919 --> 00:44:31.011
If we split up into pairs,

731
00:44:31.087 --> 00:44:33.385
whichever one of us is left with
the killer might get killed.


732
00:44:33.464 --> 00:44:35.967
Then we would've discovered
who the murderer is.


733
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.519
But the other half of the pair
would be dead!


734
00:44:38.594 --> 00:44:42.064
This is war, Peacock.
Casualties are inevitable.


735
00:44:42.139 --> 00:44:43.982
You cannot make an omelet
without breaking eggs.


736
00:44:44.058 --> 00:44:45.150
Every cook will tell you that.

737
00:44:45.226 --> 00:44:47.900
But look what happened to the cook.

738
00:44:48.854 --> 00:44:50.777
Colonel, are you willing to
take that chance?


739
00:44:50.856 --> 00:44:52.529
What choice have we?

740
00:44:52.608 --> 00:44:53.825
None.

741
00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:55.073
I suppose you're right.

742
00:44:55.152 --> 00:44:57.746
But it's dark upstairs.

743
00:44:57.822 --> 00:44:59.415
And I'm frightened of the dark.

744
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.242
Will anyone go with me?

745
00:45:01.325 --> 00:45:02.702
- I will.
- I will.


746
00:45:02.785 --> 00:45:04.207
No, thank you.

747
00:45:04.286 --> 00:45:08.166
I suggest we all draw lots for partners.

748
00:45:28.978 --> 00:45:31.572
Ready? The two shortest together,

749
00:45:31.647 --> 00:45:34.571
the next two shortest together. Agreed?

750
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.652
And I suggest that
the two shortest search the cellar,


751
00:45:36.735 --> 00:45:38.658
and so on, up.

752
00:46:25.034 --> 00:46:27.412
It's you and me, honeybunch.

753
00:46:29.538 --> 00:46:31.586
God.

754
00:46:44.053 --> 00:46:45.430
The cellar.

755
00:46:46.555 --> 00:46:48.978
Well, we know what's in the study.

756
00:46:49.058 --> 00:46:51.481
We've just come from the library.

757
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.483
And the stranger's locked up
in the lounge.


758
00:46:53.562 --> 00:46:56.941
Let's go look in the billiard room again.

759
00:47:30.391 --> 00:47:32.109
Do you want to go
up in front of me?

760
00:47:32.184 --> 00:47:33.606
Absolutely non.

761
00:47:33.686 --> 00:47:35.279
I'm sure there's no one up there.

762
00:47:35.354 --> 00:47:36.822
Then you go in front.

763
00:47:36.939 --> 00:47:38.316
All right.

764
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:03.724
Well, ladies first.

765
00:48:03.799 --> 00:48:06.302
No, no, you can go first.

766
00:48:06.385 --> 00:48:08.638
- No, no, no, I insist.
- No, I insist.


767
00:48:08.721 --> 00:48:10.394
Well, what are you afraid of?
A fate worse than death?


768
00:48:10.472 --> 00:48:12.349
No. Just death. 
Isn't that enough?

769
00:48:14.852 --> 00:48:16.820
- Are you going in there?
- Yes. Are you?


770
00:48:16.895 --> 00:48:18.147
Yes.

771
00:48:19.231 --> 00:48:21.575
Right.

772
00:48:24.403 --> 00:48:27.373
I don't see any light switches in there.

773
00:48:27.448 --> 00:48:29.576
Neither do I. But there must be
switches somewhere.


774
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.794
- Shall I come in with you?
- No!


775
00:48:31.869 --> 00:48:34.247
I mean, no, thank you.

776
00:48:45.424 --> 00:48:46.846
Ladies first.

777
00:48:46.925 --> 00:48:48.347
No, thanks.

778
00:49:24.963 --> 00:49:27.682
Go on. I'll be right behind you.

779
00:49:27.758 --> 00:49:29.510
That's why I'm nervous.

780
00:49:29.718 --> 00:49:31.641
Then we go together.

781
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:52.912
Stay there.

782
00:50:01.291 --> 00:50:03.714
If there's anybody in here,

783
00:50:03.794 --> 00:50:05.216
just look out!

784
00:50:05.295 --> 00:50:06.842
Are you hiding?

785
00:50:07.798 --> 00:50:09.220
I'm coming.

786
00:50:11.844 --> 00:50:13.391
What room's this?

787
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.562
Search me.

788
00:50:14.638 --> 00:50:15.810
All right.

789
00:50:15.889 --> 00:50:18.312
Get your mitts off me.

790
00:50:22.146 --> 00:50:23.147
Aah.

791
00:50:41.373 --> 00:50:42.875
Nobody here.

792
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.219
He's behind one of those curtains.

793
00:50:46.211 --> 00:50:48.259
You look. I'll search the kitchen.

794
00:52:23.934 --> 00:52:26.153
I'm a little nervous.

795
00:52:26.937 --> 00:52:28.439
I'm in this big house,

796
00:52:28.522 --> 00:52:31.116
and I've been locked into the lounge.

797
00:52:32.776 --> 00:52:33.823
Yes.

798
00:52:33.902 --> 00:52:35.996
The funny thing is,

799
00:52:36.071 --> 00:52:38.244
there's a whole group of people here

800
00:52:38.323 --> 00:52:39.996
having some sort of party,

801
00:52:41.618 --> 00:52:44.041
and one of them
is my old boss from...

802
00:53:27.456 --> 00:53:28.753
Whoa!

803
00:53:30.459 --> 00:53:33.053
Looks like a secret passage.

804
00:53:36.131 --> 00:53:38.054
Should we see where it leads?

805
00:53:38.133 --> 00:53:39.555
What the hell.

806
00:53:39.635 --> 00:53:41.057
I'll go first.

807
00:53:41.136 --> 00:53:43.184
I've had a good life.

808
00:53:47.184 --> 00:53:49.653
- Aah! God!
- It's all right.


809
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:02.908
My God!

810
00:54:10.666 --> 00:54:12.088
Come on!

811
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.422
Please! Help us!

812
00:54:18.882 --> 00:54:20.850
Help! Help!

813
00:54:21.176 --> 00:54:22.598
Down here!

814
00:54:22.678 --> 00:54:25.978
Down here! Get us out of here! Please!

815
00:54:26.056 --> 00:54:27.524
Where's it coming from?

816
00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:29.897
Where are we going?

817
00:54:29.977 --> 00:54:31.854
- Where are they?
- The lounge!


818
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:36.612
The door is locked!

819
00:54:36.692 --> 00:54:38.114
- I know.
- Then unlock it.


820
00:54:38.193 --> 00:54:39.615
Where's the key?

821
00:54:39.695 --> 00:54:41.117
The key's gone!

822
00:54:41.196 --> 00:54:42.618
Never mind about the key.
Unlock the door!


823
00:54:42.698 --> 00:54:46.123
I can't unlock the door without the key!

824
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:47.578
Let us in! Let us in!

825
00:54:47.703 --> 00:54:49.455
Let us out! Let us out!

826
00:54:49.579 --> 00:54:51.627
It's no good. Stand back.

827
00:54:51.748 --> 00:54:56.174
There's no alternative.
I'm just going to have to break it down.


828
00:54:58.588 --> 00:55:00.966
I know! I have it!

829
00:55:01.049 --> 00:55:02.221
Help!

830
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.723
Will you shut up? 
We're doing our best.

831
00:55:05.012 --> 00:55:06.013
Help!

832
00:55:10.017 --> 00:55:11.940
They're shooting at us.

833
00:55:19.526 --> 00:55:20.652
I've been shot.

834
00:55:20.736 --> 00:55:23.831
- I've been shot.
- Come out. The door is open.


835
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.374
Why are you shooting that thing at us?

836
00:55:29.453 --> 00:55:31.126
To get you out.

837
00:55:31.204 --> 00:55:32.626
You know
you could've killed us.


838
00:55:32.706 --> 00:55:34.879
I could've been killed!

839
00:55:34.958 --> 00:55:36.551
I can't take any more scares.

840
00:55:43.383 --> 00:55:44.805
But, look!

841
00:55:47.804 --> 00:55:49.351
Which one of you did it?

842
00:55:49.431 --> 00:55:52.025
We found him together.

843
00:55:52.142 --> 00:55:53.940
- How did you get in?
- The door was locked.


844
00:55:54.019 --> 00:55:55.020
It's a great trick.

845
00:55:55.187 --> 00:55:57.155
There's a secret passageway from
the conservatory.


846
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.278
- Is that the same gun?
- From the cupboard?


847
00:55:59.357 --> 00:56:00.734
But it was locked!

848
00:56:00.817 --> 00:56:02.490
- No. It was unlocked.
- Unlocked?


849
00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:04.739
But yes. See for yourself.

850
00:56:12.996 --> 00:56:14.464
How did you know it was unlocked?

851
00:56:14.539 --> 00:56:15.882
How did you know that
you could get at the gun?


852
00:56:15.957 --> 00:56:17.004
I didn't.

853
00:56:17.084 --> 00:56:20.258
I think I would break it open,
but it was open already.


854
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.013
A likely story.

855
00:56:25.258 --> 00:56:27.807
Maybe they'll just go away.

856
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:39.614
- I'm going to open it.
- Why?


857
00:56:39.689 --> 00:56:41.657
I have nothing to hide.

858
00:56:41.733 --> 00:56:43.280
I didn't do it.

859
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.829
The key.

860
00:56:45.904 --> 00:56:47.372
Thank you.

861
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.668
Good evening, sir.

862
00:56:54.704 --> 00:56:55.796
Yes?

863
00:56:55.872 --> 00:56:58.716
I found an abandoned car down near
the gates of this house.


864
00:56:58.792 --> 00:57:01.045
Did the driver come in here for
any help by any chance?


865
00:57:01.128 --> 00:57:04.132
- No, no.
- No.


866
00:57:04.214 --> 00:57:06.558
- Well, actually, yes.
- No.


867
00:57:06.967 --> 00:57:09.061
There seems to be some kind of
disagreement.


868
00:57:09.136 --> 00:57:11.514
No.

869
00:57:11.596 --> 00:57:12.893
Yes.

870
00:57:12.973 --> 00:57:15.226
Can I come in and use your phone?

871
00:57:15.308 --> 00:57:17.652
Of course you may, sir.

872
00:57:17.727 --> 00:57:19.570
You may use the one in the...

873
00:57:20.564 --> 00:57:22.783
No. You could use the one in the...

874
00:57:22.858 --> 00:57:24.280
No.

875
00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:27.033
Would you be kind enough to wait
in the...


876
00:57:27.112 --> 00:57:29.331
In the library.

877
00:57:29.406 --> 00:57:30.908
Sure.

878
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:39.924
Don't I know you from someplace?

879
00:57:41.751 --> 00:57:44.129
You all seem to be very
anxious about something.


880
00:57:44.212 --> 00:57:46.556
It's the chandelier,
fell down and almost killed us.


881
00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:49.100
Would you like to come
this way please, sir?


882
00:57:57.475 --> 00:58:00.274
Frightfully drafty, these old houses.

883
00:58:03.064 --> 00:58:07.069
Please help yourself to a drink,
if you'd like.


884
00:58:07.152 --> 00:58:08.950
Not the cognac, just in case.

885
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:10.872
Just in case of what?

886
00:58:15.911 --> 00:58:17.504
What now?

887
00:58:20.832 --> 00:58:21.833
We should've told him.

888
00:58:21.917 --> 00:58:23.885
- All very well for you to say that now.
- I said it then.


889
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.382
Shut up!

890
00:58:25.462 --> 00:58:26.930
Let's clean this up.

891
00:58:39.768 --> 00:58:41.315
Hello.

892
00:58:42.646 --> 00:58:44.239
Maybe the cop answered it.

893
00:58:44.314 --> 00:58:46.237
And who shall I say is calling?

894
00:58:49.778 --> 00:58:52.201
Would you hold on, please?

895
00:58:56.159 --> 00:59:00.585
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
You have no right to shut me in.


896
00:59:00.664 --> 00:59:03.213
I'll book you for false arrest

897
00:59:03.291 --> 00:59:06.386
and wrongful imprisonment
and obstructing an officer


898
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:08.930
in the course of his duty, and murder!

899
00:59:10.882 --> 00:59:14.011
What do you mean, murder?

900
00:59:14.094 --> 00:59:18.190
I just said it so you would open the door.
What's going on around here?


901
00:59:18.515 --> 00:59:20.483
And why would you lock me in?

902
00:59:20.558 --> 00:59:23.186
And why are you receiving phone calls
from J. Edgar Hoover?


903
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:25.773
- J. Edgar Hoover?
- That's right.


904
00:59:25.855 --> 00:59:28.574
The head of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.


905
00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:30.698
Why is J. Edgar Hoover on your phone?

906
00:59:30.777 --> 00:59:33.496
I don't know. He's on everybody else's.
Why shouldn't he be on mine?


907
00:59:33.697 --> 00:59:34.869
Excuse me.

908
00:59:41.288 --> 00:59:42.710
What's going on here?

909
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:44.336
We're having a party.

910
00:59:47.252 --> 00:59:49.801
- Mind if I look around?
- Sure.


911
00:59:53.216 --> 00:59:54.684
You can show him around, Mr. Green.

912
00:59:54.759 --> 00:59:55.885
Me?

913
00:59:55.969 --> 00:59:58.722
Yes. You can show him the dining room,

914
00:59:58.805 --> 01:00:01.058
the kitchen, the ballroom.

915
01:00:01.933 --> 01:00:03.105
Fine.

916
01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:05.816
Fine.

917
01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:10.241
Officer, come with me.
I'll show you the dining room


918
01:00:10.317 --> 01:00:11.489
or the kitchen

919
01:00:11.568 --> 01:00:13.195
or the ballroom.

920
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:18.788
Make it look convincing.

921
01:00:20.827 --> 01:00:23.171
So, this is the dining room.

922
01:00:23.246 --> 01:00:24.463
No kidding?

923
01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:26.132
Come on!

924
01:00:26.207 --> 01:00:29.177
What's going on in those two rooms?

925
01:00:29.252 --> 01:00:30.549
Which two rooms?

926
01:00:35.258 --> 01:00:37.056
Those two rooms.

927
01:00:37.135 --> 01:00:38.682
Those two rooms.

928
01:00:38.762 --> 01:00:40.139
Yes!

929
01:00:42.265 --> 01:00:44.688
Officer, I don't think you should
go in there.


930
01:00:44.768 --> 01:00:46.145
Why not?

931
01:00:48.605 --> 01:00:50.983
Because it's all too shocking.

932
01:01:16.966 --> 01:01:18.639
It's not all that shocking.

933
01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:22.222
These folks are just having a good time.

934
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.108
My God.

935
01:01:38.196 --> 01:01:39.322
Excuse me.

936
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:51.843
This man's drunk.

937
01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:53.670
Dead drunk.

938
01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:55.426
Dead right.

939
01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:58.099
You're not gonna drive home, are you?

940
01:01:58.174 --> 01:02:00.927
He won't be driving home, Officer.
I promise you that.


941
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.853
Somebody will give him a lift, huh?

942
01:02:02.929 --> 01:02:04.476
We'll get him a car.

943
01:02:04.556 --> 01:02:05.773
A long black car.

944
01:02:05.849 --> 01:02:07.271
A limousine.

945
01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.948
- Officer.
- You're too late. I've seen it all.


946
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:23.499
You have? I can explain everything.

947
01:02:23.575 --> 01:02:24.792
- You don't have to.
- I don't?


948
01:02:24.868 --> 01:02:26.962
Don't worry.
There's nothing illegal about any of this.


949
01:02:27.036 --> 01:02:28.083
Are you sure?

950
01:02:28.163 --> 01:02:29.790
Of course. This is America.

951
01:02:29.873 --> 01:02:32.717
- I see.
- It's a free country. Don't you know that?


952
01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:35.716
I didn't know it was that free.

953
01:02:36.713 --> 01:02:38.056
May I use your phone now?

954
01:02:38.131 --> 01:02:39.633
Certainly.

955
01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:50.276
Why did you
lock him in again?


956
01:02:51.686 --> 01:02:53.984
We haven't finished searching
the house yet.


957
01:02:54.063 --> 01:02:56.987
We're running out of time.
Only 15 minutes before the police come.


958
01:02:57.066 --> 01:02:58.158
The police already came!

959
01:02:58.234 --> 01:02:59.235
- Shut up!
- Shut Up!


960
01:02:59.319 --> 01:03:01.287
- Let's get on with it.
- Monsieur.


961
01:03:30.016 --> 01:03:31.609
Look.

962
01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:33.778
I can't believe it.

963
01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:36.948
- I wonder where this one goes.
- Well, let's find out.


964
01:03:37.023 --> 01:03:38.115
Okay.

965
01:03:57.085 --> 01:03:58.553
Let's try the ballroom again.

966
01:04:24.529 --> 01:04:25.576
Aah!

967
01:04:25.655 --> 01:04:27.373
Don't you touch me!

968
01:04:31.327 --> 01:04:32.328
Aah!

969
01:04:33.204 --> 01:04:34.205
Aah!

970
01:04:42.171 --> 01:04:44.640
Hello? Hello?

971
01:04:44.716 --> 01:04:46.718
Shut the door.

972
01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:50.848
Did anyone recognize you?

973
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.353
They must have, and not just my face.

974
01:04:53.433 --> 01:04:55.777
They know every inch of my body,

975
01:04:55.852 --> 01:04:58.355
and they're not the only ones.

976
01:04:58.438 --> 01:05:00.281
It's you!

977
01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:06.279
Something funny's going on here.

978
01:05:06.362 --> 01:05:08.660
I don't know what it is.

979
01:05:11.534 --> 01:05:13.753
No, I'm not on duty,

980
01:05:13.828 --> 01:05:17.549
but I have a
feeling that I'm in danger.

981
01:05:17.624 --> 01:05:20.468
You know that big ugly house...

982
01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:23.888
Hello?

983
01:05:26.215 --> 01:05:27.637
Are you there?

984
01:05:36.392 --> 01:05:38.144
Da da da da da da

985
01:05:38.227 --> 01:05:40.901
I am your singing telegram

986
01:05:49.864 --> 01:05:50.865
Aah!

987
01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.791
I'm coming! I'm coming!

988
01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:54.961
I'm just trying to find the door.

989
01:05:55.036 --> 01:05:56.413
Help me!

990
01:05:56.496 --> 01:05:58.214
Coming!

991
01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.173
What's this?

992
01:06:00.249 --> 01:06:02.092
Another door?

993
01:07:12.321 --> 01:07:13.698
Two murders.

994
01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:24.167
Neither of them shot.

995
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.252
- I thought I heard a gun.
- So did I.


996
01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:28.758
- I thought I heard the front door slam.
- God.


997
01:07:28.838 --> 01:07:30.966
The murderer must've run out.

998
01:07:35.344 --> 01:07:37.517
Three murders?

999
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.648
Six all together.

1000
01:07:40.516 --> 01:07:42.564
This is getting serious.

1001
01:07:51.194 --> 01:07:54.698
No gun. Yvette dropped it here.

1002
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.163
Very well, I know who did it.

1003
01:07:58.242 --> 01:07:59.619
You do?

1004
01:07:59.702 --> 01:08:02.672
And furthermore,
I'm gonna tell you how it was all done.


1005
01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:04.544
Follow me.

1006
01:08:08.795 --> 01:08:10.547
In order to help you understand
what happened,


1007
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:13.930
I shall need to take you through
the events of the evening step-by-step.


1008
01:08:14.008 --> 01:08:17.603
At the start of the evening,
Yvette was here by herself,


1009
01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:20.648
waiting to offer you all
a glass of champagne.


1010
01:08:20.723 --> 01:08:23.192
I was in the hall.

1011
01:08:25.603 --> 01:08:26.820
I know because I was there.

1012
01:08:26.896 --> 01:08:30.241
Then I hurried across to the kitchen.

1013
01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:34.328
And the cook was in here, alive,

1014
01:08:34.403 --> 01:08:36.155
sharpening knives, preparing for dinner.

1015
01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:37.582
And then

1016
01:08:39.075 --> 01:08:40.622
the doorbell rang.

1017
01:08:42.078 --> 01:08:44.297
- And it was you.
- Yes.


1018
01:08:44.372 --> 01:08:46.670
I asked you for your coat, and
I recognized you as Colonel Mustard.


1019
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:48.001
And I prevented you
from telling me your real name


1020
01:08:48.084 --> 01:08:50.587
because I didn't want any of you to use
any name other than your pseudonym.


1021
01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:51.671
And I introduced myself to you
as a butler,


1022
01:08:51.754 --> 01:08:53.756
and I made across
the hall to the library.

1023
01:08:55.424 --> 01:08:59.474
And then Yvette met you and smiled
and poured you a drink.


1024
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:03.353
And the doorbell rang.

1025
01:09:03.432 --> 01:09:05.059
And it was Mrs. White
looking pale and tragic.


1026
01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:07.110
And I took her
coat and hung it up.

1027
01:09:08.396 --> 01:09:10.694
And I introduced Mrs. White
to Colonel Mustard.


1028
01:09:10.773 --> 01:09:12.195
"Hello." "Hello."

1029
01:09:12.275 --> 01:09:15.279
And I noticed that Mrs. White
and Yvette flinched.


1030
01:09:15.361 --> 01:09:18.456
Then there was a rumble of thunder
and a crash of lightning.


1031
01:09:19.615 --> 01:09:21.743
- And to make a long story short...
- Too late!


1032
01:09:21.826 --> 01:09:23.624
One by one you all arrived.

1033
01:09:23.744 --> 01:09:25.621
And then the gong was struck
by the cook.


1034
01:09:25.705 --> 01:09:28.299
And we went into the dining room.

1035
01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:32.925
And Mrs. Peacock sat here.
And Professor Plum sat here.


1036
01:09:33.004 --> 01:09:34.130
Mrs. White sat here.

1037
01:09:34.213 --> 01:09:36.307
Mr. Green, Miss Scarlet,
Colonel Mustard.


1038
01:09:36.382 --> 01:09:37.554
This chair was vacant.

1039
01:09:37.633 --> 01:09:39.931
Anyway, we all revealed
we'd all received a letter.


1040
01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:41.729
You had a letter, and you had a letter,
and you had a letter.


1041
01:09:41.804 --> 01:09:42.851
Get on with it!

1042
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.898
The point is... Blackmail!

1043
01:09:44.974 --> 01:09:47.397
All this came out after dinner
in the study.


1044
01:09:47.476 --> 01:09:48.819
You're right!

1045
01:09:51.856 --> 01:09:53.574
Mr. Green stood here.

1046
01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:55.071
And Mrs. Peacock here.

1047
01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:56.778
And Miss Scarlet here.
Professor Plum here.


1048
01:09:56.861 --> 01:09:58.408
And Colonel Mustard and Mrs. White.

1049
01:09:58.487 --> 01:10:00.910
- Get on with it!
- I'm getting there, I'm getting there.


1050
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:03.084
And Mr. Boddy went to get
the surprise packages from the hall.


1051
01:10:03.159 --> 01:10:05.161
And you all opened your presents.

1052
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:07.998
Mr. Boddy switched off the lights.

1053
01:10:14.545 --> 01:10:16.593
Grand.

1054
01:10:16.672 --> 01:10:19.425
Mr. Boddy lay on the floor
apparently dead.


1055
01:10:19.508 --> 01:10:20.851
He was dead! I examined him.

1056
01:10:20.927 --> 01:10:22.895
Then why was he bashed on the head
a few minutes later with a candlestick


1057
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:23.937
if he was dead already?

1058
01:10:24.013 --> 01:10:25.481
All right, I made a mistake.

1059
01:10:25.556 --> 01:10:28.810
Right, but if so, why was Mr. Boddy
pretending to be dead?


1060
01:10:28.893 --> 01:10:32.397
It could only be 'cause he realized
his scheme had misfired,


1061
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.778
and the gunshot was intended
to kill him, not me.


1062
01:10:34.857 --> 01:10:37.781
Look. The bullet grazed his ear.

1063
01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.955
Clearly his best hope of escaping death
was to pretend to be dead already.


1064
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:43.408
Whoever tried to grab the gun from me
in the dark was trying to kill him.


1065
01:10:43.491 --> 01:10:45.368
But remember what happened next.

1066
01:10:45.451 --> 01:10:47.874
Mrs. Peacock took a drink.

1067
01:10:47.954 --> 01:10:49.877
You said, "Maybe it's poisoned."

1068
01:10:49.956 --> 01:10:51.378
She screams. "Aah!"

1069
01:10:51.457 --> 01:10:54.381
We took her to the sofa.

1070
01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:55.962
Mr. Green...

1071
01:10:56.963 --> 01:10:59.887
"Well, I had to stop her screaming."

1072
01:10:59.966 --> 01:11:01.468
Then, more screaming.

1073
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:02.893
Yvette! The billiard room!

1074
01:11:02.969 --> 01:11:04.312
We all rushed out.

1075
01:11:06.722 --> 01:11:09.350
But one of us wasn't here. No.

1076
01:11:09.433 --> 01:11:11.185
- No?
- No?


1077
01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:12.895
Maybe one of us
was murdering the cook.


1078
01:11:12.979 --> 01:11:14.526
Who wasn't here with us?

1079
01:11:15.982 --> 01:11:17.700
- Do you know?
- I do.


1080
01:11:18.067 --> 01:11:19.284
While we stood here,

1081
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.658
trying to stop Yvette from panicking,

1082
01:11:21.737 --> 01:11:23.705
one of us could have
stayed in the study,


1083
01:11:23.781 --> 01:11:25.033
picked up the dagger,

1084
01:11:25.116 --> 01:11:27.869
run down the hall,

1085
01:11:27.952 --> 01:11:29.499
and stabbed the cook!

1086
01:11:29.578 --> 01:11:32.502
How could he risk it?
We might've seen him running back.


1087
01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:34.800
Not if they used this secret passage.

1088
01:11:35.918 --> 01:11:38.637
And the murdered ran back
down the secret passage to the study.


1089
01:11:38.713 --> 01:11:40.465
That's where it comes out?

1090
01:11:40.548 --> 01:11:41.595
WADSWORTH1 Yes! Look!

1091
01:11:43.467 --> 01:11:44.468
What?

1092
01:11:44.552 --> 01:11:45.895
How did you know?

1093
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:48.018
This house belongs to a friend of mine.
I've known all along.


1094
01:11:48.097 --> 01:11:49.349
So you could be the murderer.

1095
01:11:49.432 --> 01:11:51.685
Don't be ridiculous.
If I was the murderer,


1096
01:11:51.767 --> 01:11:53.235
would I reveal to
you how I did it?

1097
01:11:54.812 --> 01:11:56.985
Well, who else knew
about the secret passage?


1098
01:11:57.064 --> 01:11:58.987
We found it, Colonel Mustard and me.

1099
01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:00.818
You found it. You could've known
about it all the time.


1100
01:12:00.901 --> 01:12:01.993
But I didn't.

1101
01:12:02.069 --> 01:12:03.412
Well, why should we believe you?

1102
01:12:03.529 --> 01:12:05.531
Because she was with us all
in the billiard room doorway


1103
01:12:05.614 --> 01:12:07.537
while Yvette was screaming,
don't you remember?


1104
01:12:07.616 --> 01:12:08.708
But what I don't understand is

1105
01:12:08.784 --> 01:12:12.129
why was the cook murdered?
She had nothing to do with Mr. Boddy.


1106
01:12:12.204 --> 01:12:13.706
Of course she did.

1107
01:12:13.789 --> 01:12:15.211
I gathered you all here together

1108
01:12:15.291 --> 01:12:18.716
because you were all implicated
in Mr. Boddy's dastardly blackmail.


1109
01:12:18.794 --> 01:12:21.968
Did none of you deduce
the others were involved, too?


1110
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:25.218
- What others?
- The cook and Yvette.


1111
01:12:25.301 --> 01:12:26.393
No.

1112
01:12:26.469 --> 01:12:28.892
That's how he got all his information.

1113
01:12:28.971 --> 01:12:30.894
Before he could blackmail anyone,

1114
01:12:30.973 --> 01:12:33.396
Mr. Boddy had to discover
their guilty secret.


1115
01:12:33.476 --> 01:12:35.695
The cook and Yvette
were his accomplices.


1116
01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:37.022
I see.

1117
01:12:37.104 --> 01:12:39.482
So whoever knew

1118
01:12:39.565 --> 01:12:42.614
that the cook was involved killed her?

1119
01:12:42.693 --> 01:12:43.945
Yes.

1120
01:12:45.029 --> 01:12:48.124
I know, because I was
Mr. Boddy's butler,


1121
01:12:48.199 --> 01:12:50.042
that the cook had
worked for one of you.

1122
01:12:50.117 --> 01:12:51.209
Who?

1123
01:12:51.285 --> 01:12:52.537
You recognized Yvette, didn't you?

1124
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.917
Don't deny it.

1125
01:12:53.996 --> 01:12:55.418
What do you mean don't deny it?

1126
01:12:55.498 --> 01:12:56.920
I'm not denying anything.

1127
01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:58.251
Another denial.

1128
01:12:58.334 --> 01:13:01.133
All right, it's true, 
I knew Yvette.

1129
01:13:01.212 --> 01:13:04.807
My husband had an affair with her,
but I didn't care, I wasn't jealous.


1130
01:13:04.882 --> 01:13:06.304
You knew Yvette, too, didn't you?

1131
01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:07.635
Yes. She worked for me.

1132
01:13:07.718 --> 01:13:08.970
And you also knew her, sir.

1133
01:13:09.053 --> 01:13:10.396
We've already established

1134
01:13:10.471 --> 01:13:12.894
that you were one
of Miss Scarlet's clients.


1135
01:13:12.973 --> 01:13:15.226
That's why you were so desperate
to get your hands on those negatives,


1136
01:13:15.309 --> 01:13:18.859
photographs of you and Yvette
in ?agrante delicto, remember?


1137
01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:22.525
Mr. Boddy threatened to send
those pictures to my dear old mother,


1138
01:13:22.608 --> 01:13:24.030
the shock would've killed her.

1139
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:25.828
That would've been
quite an achievement,


1140
01:13:25.903 --> 01:13:27.871
since you told us that
she's dead already.


1141
01:13:27.947 --> 01:13:29.290
So, he had the motive.

1142
01:13:29.365 --> 01:13:30.867
You all had a motive.

1143
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:32.998
But where and when
was Mr. Boddy killed?


1144
01:13:33.077 --> 01:13:35.455
Don't you see? Look.

1145
01:13:35.538 --> 01:13:37.131
We came back to the study with Yvette.

1146
01:13:37.206 --> 01:13:39.629
Mr. Boddy was on the floor,
pretending to be dead,


1147
01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:41.460
but one of us knows he's alive.

1148
01:13:41.544 --> 01:13:44.468
So I explained that I was Mr. Boddy's
butler and I'd invited you here.


1149
01:13:44.547 --> 01:13:47.016
And we realized there was only
one other person in the house.


1150
01:13:47.091 --> 01:13:48.468
The cook!

1151
01:13:56.475 --> 01:13:58.898
Well, where is he?

1152
01:14:05.067 --> 01:14:06.319
By now she was dead.

1153
01:14:06.402 --> 01:14:08.200
We laid her down
with our backs to the freezer.


1154
01:14:08.404 --> 01:14:11.157
One of us slipped through
the same secret passage.


1155
01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.332
Again?

1156
01:14:12.408 --> 01:14:14.877
Of course. Back to the study.

1157
01:14:14.952 --> 01:14:16.875
The murderer was in
the secret passage.


1158
01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:19.753
Meanwhile, Mr. Boddy
had been on the floor.


1159
01:14:19.915 --> 01:14:21.337
He jumped UP.

1160
01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:24.011
The murderer came out of
the secret panel,


1161
01:14:24.086 --> 01:14:26.430
picked up the candlestick.

1162
01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:29.224
Mr. Boddy followed us out of the study
and into the hall looking for an escape.


1163
01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.019
The murderer crept up behind him
and killed him!


1164
01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:35.560
Will you stop that?

1165
01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:37.312
No.

1166
01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:40.235
Then he threw him into the toilet

1167
01:14:40.311 --> 01:14:42.905
and nonchalantly rejoined us
besides the cook's body in the kitchen.


1168
01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.027
It took less than half a minute.

1169
01:14:44.106 --> 01:14:45.904
So who wasn't there
the entire time in the kitchen?


1170
01:14:45.983 --> 01:14:47.405
Whoever it was is the murderer.

1171
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:53.373
And we put the weapons
in the cupboard


1172
01:14:53.449 --> 01:14:55.622
locked it, and ran to the front door

1173
01:14:55.743 --> 01:14:58.246
to throw away the key.

1174
01:14:58.329 --> 01:15:00.548
The motorist!

1175
01:15:00.623 --> 01:15:02.876
I didn't throw it. 
I put it in my pocket.

1176
01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:05.381
And someone could've taken it out of
my pocket and substituted another.


1177
01:15:05.461 --> 01:15:06.883
We were all in a huddle.

1178
01:15:06.962 --> 01:15:09.340
- Anyone of us could've done that.
- Precisely.


1179
01:15:09.465 --> 01:15:10.967
Wait a minute.

1180
01:15:12.301 --> 01:15:15.601
Colonel Mustard
has a top-secret Pentagon job.


1181
01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:19.058
Mrs. White's husband was
a nuclear physicist, and...


1182
01:15:20.476 --> 01:15:23.946
Yvette is a link between them.

1183
01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:25.989
What's your top-secret job, Colonel?

1184
01:15:26.065 --> 01:15:29.615
I can tell you. He's working on
the secret of the next fusion bomb.


1185
01:15:30.819 --> 01:15:32.071
How did you know that?

1186
01:15:32.154 --> 01:15:35.078
- Can you keep a secret? So can I.
- Yeah.


1187
01:15:35.157 --> 01:15:38.627
Is this a plot between them, Wadsworth,
or did Colonel Mustard do it alone?


1188
01:15:38.702 --> 01:15:40.830
We shall see.
Let's look at the other murders.


1189
01:15:40.913 --> 01:15:43.416
Yes. Bad luck that motorist
arrived at that moment.


1190
01:15:43.499 --> 01:15:45.593
It wasn't luck. 
I invited him.

1191
01:15:45.668 --> 01:15:48.046
- You did?
- Of course, it's obvious.


1192
01:15:48.128 --> 01:15:50.927
Everyone here tonight was either
Mr. Boddy's victim or accomplice.


1193
01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:54.727
Everyone who's died gave him
vital information about one of you.


1194
01:15:54.802 --> 01:15:57.146
I got them here
so they'd give evidence against him


1195
01:15:57.221 --> 01:15:58.268
and force him to confess.

1196
01:15:58.347 --> 01:15:59.894
Yeah? What about that motorist?

1197
01:15:59.974 --> 01:16:01.692
What kind of information did he have?

1198
01:16:02.393 --> 01:16:04.691
He was my driver during the war.

1199
01:16:05.104 --> 01:16:07.198
And what was he holding over you?

1200
01:16:08.023 --> 01:16:10.697
He knew that I was a war profiteer.

1201
01:16:12.653 --> 01:16:17.910
I stole essential air force radio parts,
and I sold them on the black market.


1202
01:16:17.992 --> 01:16:19.710
That's how I made all my money.

1203
01:16:20.327 --> 01:16:22.295
But that doesn't make me a murderer.

1204
01:16:22.371 --> 01:16:24.419
Well, a lot of our airmen died

1205
01:16:24.498 --> 01:16:26.626
because their radios didn't work.

1206
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:29.633
Was the policeman working
for Mr. Boddy, too?


1207
01:16:29.712 --> 01:16:31.464
The cop was from Washington.

1208
01:16:31.547 --> 01:16:32.844
He was on my payroll.

1209
01:16:32.923 --> 01:16:35.551
I bribed him once a week
so I could carry on with business.


1210
01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:37.974
Mr. Boddy found out somehow.

1211
01:16:38.053 --> 01:16:39.475
My God!

1212
01:16:39.555 --> 01:16:41.307
Please.

1213
01:16:42.433 --> 01:16:44.561
And the singing telegram girl?

1214
01:16:48.397 --> 01:16:50.525
She was my patient once.

1215
01:16:50.941 --> 01:16:53.194
I had an affair with her.

1216
01:16:53.277 --> 01:16:54.904
That's how I lost my license.

1217
01:16:54.987 --> 01:16:57.240
Mr. Boddy found that out, too.

1218
01:16:57.948 --> 01:17:01.293
Well, let's put her in the study
with the others.


1219
01:17:03.412 --> 01:17:06.882
So, now you all know why they died.

1220
01:17:06.957 --> 01:17:10.962
Whoever killed Mr. Boddy
also wanted his accomplices dead.


1221
01:17:11.045 --> 01:17:12.922
How did the murderer
know about them all?


1222
01:17:13.255 --> 01:17:14.472
I mean I admit

1223
01:17:14.548 --> 01:17:17.518
that I'd guessed that this young singer
informed on me to Mr. Boddy.


1224
01:17:17.593 --> 01:17:20.517
But I didn't know anything
about any of you until this evening.


1225
01:17:20.596 --> 01:17:23.520
First, the murderer needed
to get the weapons. Easy.


1226
01:17:23.599 --> 01:17:26.022
He stole the key from my pocket.

1227
01:17:26.143 --> 01:17:27.941
And then we all followed
Colonel Mustard's suggestion


1228
01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.693
that we split up and search the house.

1229
01:17:29.772 --> 01:17:31.149
That's right.

1230
01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:32.983
It was Colonel Mustard's suggestion.

1231
01:17:33.067 --> 01:17:35.195
And one of us got away
from his or her partner


1232
01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:37.120
and hurried to the study.

1233
01:17:37.196 --> 01:17:39.449
On the desk was the envelope
from Mr. Boddy.


1234
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:41.078
It contained photographs and letters,

1235
01:17:41.158 --> 01:17:43.911
the evidence of Mr. Boddy's
network of informants.


1236
01:17:43.994 --> 01:17:45.291
Where is the envelope now?

1237
01:17:45.371 --> 01:17:46.463
Gone.

1238
01:17:48.082 --> 01:17:49.800
Destroyed.

1239
01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:51.297
Perhaps in the fire.

1240
01:17:51.377 --> 01:17:52.970
The only possible place.

1241
01:17:54.922 --> 01:17:56.014
Aha!

1242
01:17:57.091 --> 01:17:58.968
Then, having found out the whole story,

1243
01:17:59.051 --> 01:18:01.395
the murderer went to the cupboard,

1244
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:03.143
unlocked it with the key,
took out the wrench...


1245
01:18:03.305 --> 01:18:06.605
Then we found the secret passage
from the conservatory to the lounge,


1246
01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:08.435
where we found the motorist dead.

1247
01:18:08.519 --> 01:18:10.442
That's right. And we couldn't get in.

1248
01:18:10.521 --> 01:18:12.239
So Yvette ran to the open cupboard,

1249
01:18:12.314 --> 01:18:15.443
got the gun, and shot the door open.
Bang!


1250
01:18:15.526 --> 01:18:16.743
And then the doorbell rang.

1251
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:22.033
Whoever it is, they've got to go away,

1252
01:18:22.116 --> 01:18:24.039
or they'll be killed.

1253
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.296
Good evening. Have you ever given any
thought to the kingdom of heaven?


1254
01:18:30.374 --> 01:18:31.421
What?

1255
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.424
Repent.
The kingdom of heaven is at hand.


1256
01:18:34.503 --> 01:18:35.925
You ain't whistling Dixie.

1257
01:18:36.004 --> 01:18:38.098
Armageddon is almost upon us.

1258
01:18:38.173 --> 01:18:39.550
I got news for you. 
It's already here.

1259
01:18:39.633 --> 01:18:40.885
Go away!

1260
01:18:40.968 --> 01:18:42.936
But your souls are in danger.

1261
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:44.888
Our lives are in danger, you beatnik!

1262
01:18:46.473 --> 01:18:47.725
The cop arrived next.

1263
01:18:47.808 --> 01:18:49.060
We locked him in the library.

1264
01:18:49.143 --> 01:18:51.020
We forgot the cupboard with
the weapons was now unlocked.


1265
01:18:51.103 --> 01:18:52.446
Then we split up again,

1266
01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:55.274
and the murderer switched off
the electricity.


1267
01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:56.651
My God!

1268
01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:57.825
Not again.

1269
01:18:57.901 --> 01:18:58.902
Turn on the lights!

1270
01:19:00.195 --> 01:19:02.197
Sorry. Didn't mean to frighten you.

1271
01:19:02.281 --> 01:19:04.124
You're a bit late for that!

1272
01:19:04.199 --> 01:19:06.076
I hate when he does that.

1273
01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.128
Then there were three more murders.

1274
01:19:08.203 --> 01:19:09.375
So which of us killed them?

1275
01:19:09.455 --> 01:19:11.378
None of us killed Mr. 
Boddy or the cook.

1276
01:19:11.457 --> 01:19:12.504
So who did?

1277
01:19:12.583 --> 01:19:15.052
The one person who wasn't with us.

1278
01:19:16.712 --> 01:19:17.713
Yvette.

1279
01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:19.264
- Yvette?
- Yvette?


1280
01:19:19.339 --> 01:19:22.138
She was in the billiards room
listening to our conversation.


1281
01:19:22.217 --> 01:19:24.219
She heard the gunshot.
She thought he was dead.


1282
01:19:24.303 --> 01:19:25.976
And while we all
examined the bullet hole,


1283
01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:29.058
she crept into the study,
picked up the dagger, ran to the kitchen,


1284
01:19:29.141 --> 01:19:30.393
and stabbed the cook.

1285
01:19:30.476 --> 01:19:31.819
We didn't hear the cook scream

1286
01:19:31.894 --> 01:19:34.693
because Mrs. Peacock was screaming
about the poisoned brandy.


1287
01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.398
Then Yvette returned
to the billiard room.


1288
01:19:36.482 --> 01:19:38.325
She screamed, and we all ran to her.

1289
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.993
When did she kill Mr. Boddy?

1290
01:19:40.068 --> 01:19:41.320
When I said.

1291
01:19:41.403 --> 01:19:43.326
We all ran to the kitchen
to see the cook.


1292
01:19:43.405 --> 01:19:45.828
Yvette hid in the study
to check that Mr. Boddy was dead.


1293
01:19:45.908 --> 01:19:48.286
He got up and followed them
down the hall.


1294
01:19:48.368 --> 01:19:50.791
So she hit him on the head
with the candlestick,


1295
01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:52.464
and dragged him to the toilet.

1296
01:19:52.539 --> 01:19:53.540
Why?

1297
01:19:53.624 --> 01:19:54.876
To create confusion.

1298
01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:56.835
It worked.

1299
01:19:56.919 --> 01:19:57.920
Why did she do it?

1300
01:19:58.003 --> 01:20:00.256
Was it because
she was acting under orders


1301
01:20:00.339 --> 01:20:02.262
from the person who later killed her?

1302
01:20:02.341 --> 01:20:03.718
- Who?
'Who?


1303
01:20:03.884 --> 01:20:04.976
Who?

1304
01:20:05.802 --> 01:20:08.806
Was it one of her clients?

1305
01:20:09.389 --> 01:20:11.812
Or was it a jealous wife?

1306
01:20:11.892 --> 01:20:13.815
Or an adulterous doctor?

1307
01:20:14.645 --> 01:20:15.862
No.

1308
01:20:15.938 --> 01:20:18.361
It was her employer, Miss Scarlet.

1309
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.692
That's a lie!

1310
01:20:19.775 --> 01:20:21.197
Is it?

1311
01:20:21.276 --> 01:20:24.029
You used her
the way you always used her.


1312
01:20:24.112 --> 01:20:26.706
You killed the motorist
when we split up to search the house.


1313
01:20:26.782 --> 01:20:28.750
How could I have known
about the secret passage?


1314
01:20:28.825 --> 01:20:30.668
Easy. Yvette told you.

1315
01:20:30.953 --> 01:20:34.548
So when we split up again,
you switched off the electricity.


1316
01:20:34.623 --> 01:20:36.546
It was easy for you
here on the ground ?oor.


1317
01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:40.880
Then, in the dark, you got the lead pipe,
and the rope, strangled Yvette,


1318
01:20:40.963 --> 01:20:43.386
ran to the library, killed the cop,

1319
01:20:43.465 --> 01:20:46.264
picked up the gun
where Yvette dropped it,


1320
01:20:46.343 --> 01:20:47.936
opened the front door,

1321
01:20:48.011 --> 01:20:50.855
recognized the singing telegram
from her photograph,


1322
01:20:50.931 --> 01:20:52.433
and shot her.

1323
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.317
You've no proof.

1324
01:20:54.393 --> 01:20:55.770
The gun is missing.

1325
01:20:55.852 --> 01:20:57.775
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.

1326
01:20:57.854 --> 01:20:59.652
Ladies, empty your purses.

1327
01:21:00.524 --> 01:21:04.074
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.

1328
01:21:04.152 --> 01:21:05.654
Brilliantly worked out, Wadsworth.

1329
01:21:05.737 --> 01:21:06.989
I congratulate you.

1330
01:21:07.114 --> 01:21:08.240
Me, too.

1331
01:21:08.323 --> 01:21:09.620
Shut Up!

1332
01:21:09.825 --> 01:21:11.668
Now there's one thing
I don't understand.


1333
01:21:11.743 --> 01:21:12.915
One thing?

1334
01:21:12.995 --> 01:21:14.087
Why did you do it?

1335
01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:16.381
Half of Washington knows
what kind of business you run.


1336
01:21:16.582 --> 01:21:18.755
You were in no real danger.

1337
01:21:18.834 --> 01:21:20.928
The whole town would be implicated
if you were exposed.


1338
01:21:21.003 --> 01:21:23.426
I don't think they know my real business.

1339
01:21:23.505 --> 01:21:25.428
My business is secrets.

1340
01:21:25.507 --> 01:21:28.431
Yvette found them out for me.

1341
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:31.434
The secrets of Senator Peacock's
defense committee,


1342
01:21:31.513 --> 01:21:34.813
of Colonel Mustard's fusion bomb,

1343
01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:37.314
Professor Plum's UN contacts,

1344
01:21:38.061 --> 01:21:40.530
and the work of your husband,

1345
01:21:40.606 --> 01:21:43.450
the nuclear physicist.

1346
01:21:44.109 --> 01:21:45.907
So, it is political.

1347
01:21:45.986 --> 01:21:47.329
You're a communist!

1348
01:21:47.404 --> 01:21:50.874
No, Mr. Green,
communism is just a red herring.


1349
01:21:51.575 --> 01:21:53.168
Like all members
of the oldest profession,


1350
01:21:53.243 --> 01:21:54.540
I'm a capitalist,

1351
01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.748
and I'm gonna sell my secrets,

1352
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:58.252
your secrets,

1353
01:21:58.332 --> 01:22:00.005
to the highest bidder.

1354
01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:02.381
What if we don't cooperate?

1355
01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:05.180
You will, or I'll expose you.

1356
01:22:05.255 --> 01:22:07.223
We could expose you. Six murders?

1357
01:22:07.299 --> 01:22:10.599
I hardly think it will enhance your
reputation at the UN, Professor Plum,


1358
01:22:10.677 --> 01:22:12.930
if it's revealed that
you've been implicated


1359
01:22:13.013 --> 01:22:14.936
not only in adultery
with one of your patients


1360
01:22:15.015 --> 01:22:18.610
but in her death
and the deaths of five other people.


1361
01:22:18.685 --> 01:22:20.153
You don't know what kind of people
they have at the UN.


1362
01:22:20.228 --> 01:22:21.571
I might go up in their estimation.

1363
01:22:21.647 --> 01:22:24.901
And it's no good
blackmailing me, madam.


1364
01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.235
I have no more money.

1365
01:22:26.318 --> 01:22:27.570
Neither do I.

1366
01:22:27.653 --> 01:22:29.075
I know, sweetie pie.

1367
01:22:29.154 --> 01:22:31.452
But you can pay me
in government information.


1368
01:22:31.531 --> 01:22:32.908
All of you.

1369
01:22:34.493 --> 01:22:36.495
Except you, Wadsworth.

1370
01:22:36.578 --> 01:22:38.125
You as a mere butler

1371
01:22:38.205 --> 01:22:40.708
have no access to government secrets.

1372
01:22:40.791 --> 01:22:44.512
So, I'm afraid your moment has come.

1373
01:22:44.586 --> 01:22:46.338
Not so fast, Miss Scarlet.

1374
01:22:46.421 --> 01:22:47.798
I do have a secret or two.

1375
01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:50.100
- Yeah? Such as?
- The game's up, Scarlet.


1376
01:22:50.175 --> 01:22:51.927
There are no more bullets
left in that gun.


1377
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:54.263
Come on. You don't think
I'm gonna fall for that old trick.


1378
01:22:54.346 --> 01:22:55.518
It's not a trick.

1379
01:22:55.597 --> 01:22:57.850
There was one shot at Mr. Boddy in
the study, two for the chandelier,


1380
01:22:57.933 --> 01:23:00.106
two at the lounge door,
and one for the singing telegram.


1381
01:23:00.185 --> 01:23:02.984
- That's not six.
- One plus two plus two plus one.


1382
01:23:03.105 --> 01:23:05.449
- uh. It was only one shot
that got the chandelier.


1383
01:23:05.524 --> 01:23:07.117
That's one plus two plus one plus one.

1384
01:23:07.192 --> 01:23:09.536
Even if you're right, that'll be
one plus one plus two plus one.


1385
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:11.534
Not one plus two plus one plus one.

1386
01:23:11.613 --> 01:23:14.913
Okay, fine, one plus two plus one...
Shut up!


1387
01:23:15.242 --> 01:23:17.586
Point is there's one bullet left
in this gun.


1388
01:23:17.661 --> 01:23:19.584
And guess who's getting it?

1389
01:23:19.663 --> 01:23:22.416
Om

1390
01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:32.009
I'm only a guest.

1391
01:23:35.095 --> 01:23:36.517
Where's the chief?

1392
01:23:37.889 --> 01:23:39.937
Wadsworth, well done.

1393
01:23:40.016 --> 01:23:42.439
I did warn you, my dear.

1394
01:23:42.519 --> 01:23:45.443
Mr. Hoover is an expert on Armageddon.

1395
01:23:45.522 --> 01:23:48.947
Wadsworth. Don't hate me
for trying to shoot you.


1396
01:23:49.025 --> 01:23:50.823
Frankly, Scarlet, 
I don't give a damn.

1397
01:23:50.902 --> 01:23:54.076
As I was trying to tell you, there are
no bullets left in this gun, you see?


1398
01:23:58.201 --> 01:23:59.953
One plus two...

1399
01:24:00.036 --> 01:24:01.538
Plus one...

1400
01:24:01.621 --> 01:24:03.089
Plus two...

1401
01:24:03.165 --> 01:24:05.338
Plus one is...

1402
01:24:20.348 --> 01:24:22.976
In the dark, the murderer
ran across the hall to the study,


1403
01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:24.732
picked up the rope and the lead pipe,

1404
01:24:24.811 --> 01:24:26.438
ran to the billiard room,

1405
01:24:26.521 --> 01:24:28.615
strangled Yvette.

1406
01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:32.995
Ran to the library, hit the cop
on the head with the lead pipe.


1407
01:24:33.069 --> 01:24:36.039
Then, coming out of the library, the
doorbell rang. It was a singing telegram.


1408
01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:38.116
The murderer picked up the gun
where Yvette dropped it,


1409
01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.622
ran to the door, opened it,

1410
01:24:39.701 --> 01:24:41.453
recognized the girl
from her photograph, shot her,


1411
01:24:41.536 --> 01:24:43.413
and then ran back to the cellar.

1412
01:24:43.497 --> 01:24:45.249
- The cellar!
- Yes.


1413
01:24:45.332 --> 01:24:47.460
But Colonel Mustard
wasn't in the cellar.


1414
01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:50.887
No, but you were.

1415
01:24:51.963 --> 01:24:53.010
So?

1416
01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:54.557
You murdered them all.

1417
01:24:54.633 --> 01:24:55.930
You were the person who was missing

1418
01:24:56.009 --> 01:24:57.386
when the cook and Mr. Boddy
were murdered,


1419
01:24:57.469 --> 01:24:59.471
and the cook used to be your cook.

1420
01:24:59.554 --> 01:25:02.728
Don't you remember your fatal mistake?

1421
01:25:02.891 --> 01:25:04.359
You told us at dinner

1422
01:25:04.434 --> 01:25:07.028
that we were eating
one of your favorite recipes,


1423
01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:10.482
and monkey's brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,


1424
01:25:10.565 --> 01:25:12.818
are not often to be found
in Washington, D.C.


1425
01:25:12.901 --> 01:25:15.324
Is that what we ate?

1426
01:25:15.403 --> 01:25:17.497
Why would I have murdered
all the others?


1427
01:25:17.572 --> 01:25:19.950
Obviously, in case Mr. Boddy
had told them about you.


1428
01:25:20.033 --> 01:25:22.832
So this all had nothing to do
with the disappearing nuclear physicist


1429
01:25:22.911 --> 01:25:24.663
and Colonel Mustard's work
on the new fusion bomb.


1430
01:25:24.746 --> 01:25:26.794
No. Communism was just a red herring.

1431
01:25:26.873 --> 01:25:29.752
Mrs. Peacock did it all.

1432
01:25:29.835 --> 01:25:31.178
There's no proof.

1433
01:25:31.253 --> 01:25:33.176
Well, the gun is missing.

1434
01:25:33.255 --> 01:25:35.223
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.

1435
01:25:35.298 --> 01:25:37.050
Ladies, empty your purses.

1436
01:25:37.133 --> 01:25:39.431
Whoever has the gun

1437
01:25:39.511 --> 01:25:41.354
- is the murderer.
- Very well.


1438
01:25:43.431 --> 01:25:46.401
What do you propose to do about it?

1439
01:25:46.476 --> 01:25:48.399
Nothing.

1440
01:25:48.478 --> 01:25:50.196
- Nothing?
- Nothing at all.


1441
01:25:50.397 --> 01:25:52.240
I don't approve of murder,

1442
01:25:52.315 --> 01:25:54.568
but it seems to me you've done
the world a public service


1443
01:25:54.651 --> 01:25:57.871
by ridding it of an appalling blackmailer
and his disgusting informers.


1444
01:25:57.946 --> 01:26:00.244
But the police will be here any minute.
What happens then?


1445
01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:01.825
Why should the police come?

1446
01:26:01.908 --> 01:26:03.125
Nobody's called them.

1447
01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:05.545
- You mean...
- That's right.


1448
01:26:06.454 --> 01:26:10.379
Now I suggest that we stack
the bodies in the cellar,


1449
01:26:10.458 --> 01:26:12.961
lock it, leave quietly one at a time,

1450
01:26:13.044 --> 01:26:15.888
and pretend that none of this
has ever happened.


1451
01:26:15.964 --> 01:26:17.887
Great idea.

1452
01:26:17.966 --> 01:26:20.685
I'll leave first, if you don't mind.

1453
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:23.221
Be my guest.

1454
01:26:23.805 --> 01:26:27.230
In fact, I think we all owe you
a vote of thanks.


1455
01:26:29.144 --> 01:26:31.397
For she's a jolly good fellow.

1456
01:26:31.479 --> 01:26:37.612
For she's a jolly good fellow.

1457
01:26:37.694 --> 01:26:44.703
Which nobody can deny.

1458
01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:48.914
For she's a jolly good fellow.

1459
01:26:48.997 --> 01:26:50.920
For she's a jolly...

1460
01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:53.593
I told you I didn't do it.

1461
01:26:53.668 --> 01:26:55.545
What if the authorities find out
what happened?


1462
01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:57.427
The FBI will take care of that.

1463
01:26:57.505 --> 01:26:59.758
- You mean...
- My call from Mr. Hoover.


1464
01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:01.309
I work for him of course.

1465
01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:03.512
How else could I have known
everything about you all?


1466
01:27:03.678 --> 01:27:05.680
There's still one thing
I don't understand.


1467
01:27:05.764 --> 01:27:07.141
One thing?

1468
01:27:07.223 --> 01:27:09.976
Who was Mrs. Peacock
taking bribes from?


1469
01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:11.357
A foreign power.

1470
01:27:11.436 --> 01:27:13.564
Her husband, the senator,
has influence over defense contracts.


1471
01:27:13.855 --> 01:27:14.981
Is there gonna be a cover-up?

1472
01:27:15.065 --> 01:27:18.444
Isn't that in the public interest?
What could be gained by exposure?


1473
01:27:18.526 --> 01:27:21.405
Does the FBI have a habit
of cleaning up after multiple murder?


1474
01:27:21.488 --> 01:27:24.037
Yes. Why do you think
it's run by a man called Hoover?


1475
01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:31.714
Mrs. Peacock.

1476
01:27:35.585 --> 01:27:36.802
How did you know my name?

1477
01:27:36.878 --> 01:27:39.631
The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

1478
01:27:40.924 --> 01:27:42.801
Okay, take her away.

1479
01:27:44.970 --> 01:27:46.347
Take your hands off me!

1480
01:27:46.972 --> 01:27:48.849
I'm a senator's wife!

1481
01:27:51.226 --> 01:27:52.944
Wadsworth, we got her.

1482
01:27:53.019 --> 01:27:55.488
You see, it's like the Mounties.

1483
01:27:55.563 --> 01:27:57.486
We always get our man.

1484
01:27:57.565 --> 01:27:59.442
Mrs. Peacock was a man?

1485
01:28:01.361 --> 01:28:04.160
Would anyone care for fruit or dessert?

1486
01:28:17.252 --> 01:28:19.675
Sorry, didn't mean to frighten anyone.

1487
01:28:19.754 --> 01:28:21.256
You're a bit late for that!

1488
01:28:21.339 --> 01:28:23.216
Then there were three more murders.

1489
01:28:23.299 --> 01:28:24.676
- Who did it?
- Who did it?


1490
01:28:24.759 --> 01:28:28.059
Let's consider each murder one by one.

1491
01:28:28.138 --> 01:28:31.062
Professor Plum.
You knew Mr. Boddy was still alive.


1492
01:28:31.141 --> 01:28:33.564
Even psychiatrists
can tell the difference


1493
01:28:33.643 --> 01:28:35.896
between patients who are alive or dead.

1494
01:28:35.979 --> 01:28:38.107
You fired the gun in the dark,
and missed,


1495
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:40.157
so you pretended he was dead

1496
01:28:40.233 --> 01:28:43.362
that's how you were able
to kill him later, unobserved.


1497
01:28:43.445 --> 01:28:46.164
That's right. He was the missing
person in the kitchen


1498
01:28:46.239 --> 01:28:47.365
after we found the cook dead.

1499
01:28:47.449 --> 01:28:50.293
But he was with us in the billiard room
when we found Yvette screaming.


1500
01:28:50.368 --> 01:28:52.166
If that's when the cook was killed,
how did he do it?


1501
01:28:52.245 --> 01:28:53.212
I didn't!

1502
01:28:53.288 --> 01:28:55.711
You don't expect us to believe that,
do you?


1503
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:58.043
I expect you to believe it.
You killed the cook,


1504
01:28:58.168 --> 01:29:01.468
she used to be your cook,
and she informed on you to Mr. Boddy.


1505
01:29:01.546 --> 01:29:03.640
You made one fatal mistake.

1506
01:29:03.715 --> 01:29:06.685
Sitting here at dinner,
Mrs. Peacock told us she was eating


1507
01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.263
one of her favorite recipes,

1508
01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:12.815
and monkey's brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,


1509
01:29:12.891 --> 01:29:16.771
are not often to be found
in Washington, D.C.


1510
01:29:16.853 --> 01:29:20.232
Colonel Mustard, when we saw
the motorist at the front door,


1511
01:29:20.315 --> 01:29:22.909
you took the key to the weapons
cupboard out of my pocket,


1512
01:29:22.984 --> 01:29:24.702
then you suggested that we all split up.

1513
01:29:24.778 --> 01:29:26.371
You separated from Miss Scarlet,

1514
01:29:26.446 --> 01:29:30.167
crossed the hall,
opened the cupboard, took the wrench,


1515
01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:32.869
ran to the conservatory, entered the
lounge through the secret passage,


1516
01:29:32.952 --> 01:29:34.579
killed the motorist
with a blow on the head,


1517
01:29:34.662 --> 01:29:36.164
like that!

1518
01:29:38.333 --> 01:29:39.755
This is incredible.

1519
01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:42.053
Not so incredible
as what happened next.


1520
01:29:42.128 --> 01:29:43.505
After we all split up again,

1521
01:29:43.588 --> 01:29:46.842
I went upstairs with you,
yes, you, Mrs. White.


1522
01:29:46.966 --> 01:29:50.345
And while I was in the master bedroom,

1523
01:29:50.512 --> 01:29:54.233
you hurried downstairs
and turned off the electricity,


1524
01:29:54.307 --> 01:29:57.857
got the rope from the open cupboard,
and throttled Yvette.


1525
01:29:57.936 --> 01:30:00.280
Your were jealous that your husband
was shtupping Yvette.


1526
01:30:00.355 --> 01:30:02.232
That's why you killed him, too.

1527
01:30:02.315 --> 01:30:03.407
Yes.

1528
01:30:06.528 --> 01:30:09.452
Yes, I did it. 
I killed Yvette.

1529
01:30:09.531 --> 01:30:12.956
I hated her so much,

1530
01:30:13.034 --> 01:30:16.459
it flames,

1531
01:30:16.538 --> 01:30:19.291
flames on the side of my face,

1532
01:30:19.374 --> 01:30:22.924
breathing, heaving breaths,

1533
01:30:23.002 --> 01:30:24.254
heaving...

1534
01:30:24.337 --> 01:30:25.509
But while we were in the billiard room,

1535
01:30:25.588 --> 01:30:27.966
Miss Scarlet seized the opportunity
and under cover of darkness,


1536
01:30:28.049 --> 01:30:31.349
crossed to the library, where she hit
the cop, whom she'd been bribing,


1537
01:30:31.427 --> 01:30:32.849
on the head with a lead pipe.

1538
01:30:32.929 --> 01:30:34.727
True or false?

1539
01:30:34.806 --> 01:30:37.810
True. Who are you, Perry Mason?

1540
01:30:37.892 --> 01:30:40.190
So, it must have been Mr. Green
who shot the singing telegram.


1541
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:41.362
I didn't do it!

1542
01:30:41.437 --> 01:30:42.654
Well there's nobody else left.

1543
01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:44.152
But I didn't do it!

1544
01:30:44.232 --> 01:30:48.237
The gun is missing.
Whoever's got the gun, shot the girl.


1545
01:30:48.528 --> 01:30:49.700
I shot her.

1546
01:30:50.029 --> 01:30:51.076
_You .?
'You?


1547
01:30:52.574 --> 01:30:54.167
So, it was you.

1548
01:30:54.242 --> 01:30:55.539
I was going to expose you.

1549
01:30:55.618 --> 01:30:57.871
I know. So I choose to expose myself.

1550
01:30:57.954 --> 01:30:59.877
Please. There are ladies present.

1551
01:30:59.956 --> 01:31:01.833
You thought Mr. Boddy was dead.
But why?


1552
01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:04.840
None of you even met him till tonight.

1553
01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:07.088
You're Mr. Boddy!

1554
01:31:08.715 --> 01:31:10.012
Wait a minute!

1555
01:31:10.091 --> 01:31:11.764
SO who did I kill?

1556
01:31:11.843 --> 01:31:13.265
My butler.

1557
01:31:13.344 --> 01:31:15.017
Shucks.

1558
01:31:16.431 --> 01:31:18.479
He was expendable, like all of you.

1559
01:31:18.558 --> 01:31:22.608
I'm grateful to you all for disposing
of my network of spies and informers.


1560
01:31:22.687 --> 01:31:26.032
Saved me a lot of trouble.
Now there's no evidence against me.


1561
01:31:26.107 --> 01:31:27.700
This all has nothing to do

1562
01:31:27.775 --> 01:31:30.028
with my disappearing
nuclear physicist husband


1563
01:31:30.111 --> 01:31:33.331
or Colonel Mustard's work
with the new, top secret fusion bomb?


1564
01:31:33.406 --> 01:31:34.453
No.

1565
01:31:34.532 --> 01:31:36.785
Communism was just a red herring.

1566
01:31:38.786 --> 01:31:41.005
The police will be here any minute.

1567
01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.503
You'll never get away with this,
any of you.


1568
01:31:43.583 --> 01:31:46.302
Why should the police come?
Nobody's called them.


1569
01:31:46.377 --> 01:31:47.378
You mean...

1570
01:31:47.462 --> 01:31:49.089
My God. Of course!

1571
01:31:49.172 --> 01:31:51.266
So why shouldn't we get away with it?

1572
01:31:51.341 --> 01:31:53.139
We'll stack the bodies in the cellar,
lock it,


1573
01:31:53.218 --> 01:31:55.061
leave quietly, one at a time,

1574
01:31:55.136 --> 01:31:56.809
and forget that any of this
ever happened.


1575
01:31:57.055 --> 01:32:00.150
And you'll just go on blackmailing us all.

1576
01:32:00.225 --> 01:32:02.148
Of course. Why not?

1577
01:32:02.268 --> 01:32:03.645
I'll tell you why not.

1578
01:32:05.271 --> 01:32:06.272
Aah!

1579
01:32:06.356 --> 01:32:08.779
Good shot, Green.

1580
01:32:20.828 --> 01:32:23.172
Very good.

1581
01:32:31.172 --> 01:32:32.970
Are you a cop?

1582
01:32:33.049 --> 01:32:35.051
- No. I'm a plant.
- Plant?


1583
01:32:35.134 --> 01:32:36.807
I thought men like you
were usually called a fruit.


1584
01:32:36.886 --> 01:32:38.354
Very funny.

1585
01:32:38.429 --> 01:32:42.059
FBI. That phone call
from J. Edgar Hoover was for me.


1586
01:32:44.352 --> 01:32:47.151
I told you I didn't do it.

1587
01:32:52.735 --> 01:32:54.362
All right, who done it?

1588
01:32:54.445 --> 01:32:56.288
- They... She did...
- That lady... He...


1589
01:32:56.364 --> 01:32:58.287
- This one...
- Gentlemen...


1590
01:32:58.366 --> 01:32:59.959
They all did it!

1591
01:33:01.077 --> 01:33:04.297
But if you want to know
who killed Mr. Boddy,


1592
01:33:04.372 --> 01:33:07.546
I did, in the hall, with the revolver.

1593
01:33:08.835 --> 01:33:10.257
Okay, Chief, take them away.

1594
01:33:10.795 --> 01:33:13.639
I'm gonna go home
and sleep with my wife.
