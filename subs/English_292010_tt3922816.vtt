00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.560
Put that thing out of its
misery, will you, Peterson?


2
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.640
You're a good man, Peterson.

3
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.740
Give my regards to the family.

4
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.600
Yep. Thanks.

5
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.940
You'll be right. Good girl.

6
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.050
Well,
the mill<i>is</i> going to close.


7
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.510
We lost our last contract
on Friday.


8
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.040
I don't really have any choice.

9
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.700
So how long have we got?

10
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.470
It'll be the end of the month.

11
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.250
It's a very generous
redundancy package.


12
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.250
You're just giving up
on the town, are ya?


13
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.860
We've explored every possible
option. There's no way out.


14
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.860
What about old Dave?

15
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.300
He's 61 years old.
What's he supposed to do?


16
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.930
It's never too late
to start again.


17
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.530
You should hang your head
in shame!


18
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.000
Shame on you, Nielson!

19
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.940
Look, this mill
has been in my family


20
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.740
for well over 100 years.

21
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.680
I do understand your shock.

22
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.980
I'm sorry.

23
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.250
We'll all just have to try
and hold our heads up high


24
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.980
and move on.

25
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.300
What's it been -

26
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.370
You know, I don't remember.

27
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.840
Different place,

28
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.580
now your father's
shut the mill down.


29
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.050
Where's everyone moving to?

30
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.850
Depends on where
they can get jobs.


31
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.780
Yeah.

32
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.760
Your dad said you got married.

33
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.830
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

34
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.760
You got kids yet?

35
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.230
No. No, no kids.

36
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.320
Tables here,
dance floor down there.


37
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.820
- Yes.
- Now,


38
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.360
what have you decided
about the lights?


39
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.330
- They'll rig this...
- Now, do you think


40
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.260
that this floor is
a little bit uneven?


41
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.530
- I don't think so.
- Slippery though, right?


42
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.030
Now, we've decided no
with the ribbons.


43
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.670
Flowers are going to be here,

44
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.730
but tomorrow...

45
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.510
- Christian!
- Hi.


46
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.010
It's lovely to meet you.

47
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.710
It's lovely to meet you too.

48
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.550
Come on,
I'll show you to your room.


49
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.450
I have an appointment
with the florist in ten.


50
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.380
You probably want to settle in
anyway.


51
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.290
It's been hectic here this week.

52
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.790
Christian?

53
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.560
I know this might be
a bit weird for you,


54
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.900
and I just wanted to say, I
really appreciate you coming,


55
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.790
and I know that it means a lot
to your father.


56
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.110
Good flight?

57
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.340
Yeah, it was fine.

58
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.140
You hungry?
I'll make you a sandwich.


59
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.680
Since when
do you make sandwiches?


60
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.980
I've always made sandwiches!

61
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.850
I've never once seen you
make a sandwich.


62
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.350
You got everything you need
in the bedroom?


63
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.920
Yes. I guess that's
one of the advantages


64
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.790
of marrying your housekeeper.

65
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.430
- Very funny.
- How old is she?


66
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.360
She's 31.

67
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.500
Is she really?

68
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.040
- Really?
- Yeah.


69
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.140
- Oh, my god!
- - Christian


70
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.400
no, I mean,
she could be your daughter.


71
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.080
So is grace not coming?

72
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.980
She had a few meetings

73
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.450
she couldn't get out of.

74
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.150
- When's she getting here?
- Wednesday.


75
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.990
Take the Volvo. Ask Peterson
to give you the keys.


76
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.990
You've still got mom's car?

77
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.050
Why wouldn't I?

78
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.100
I'm going to go for a walk.

79
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.800
Anna's putting on
a special dinner for you.


80
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.540
Don't be late.

81
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.780
A mate of mine's a manager
of a steel mill up north.


82
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.320
I'll give him a call.

83
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.150
Charlotte's job will
tide you over.


84
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.990
Who knows if
there'll still be a school?


85
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.320
- They won't shut the school.
- Without kids left to teach?


86
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.460
Jesus.
I'll see you at the pub, then?


87
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.160
Nah, I've got to head down
to the science competition.


88
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.460
Of course, yeah.
Best of luck to Hedvig, eh?


89
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.630
Thanks, mate. Are we still
good for tomorrow?


90
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.640
Yeah, dad said we can
borrow his boat, so we're on.


91
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.970
I'm looking forward to it.

92
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.400
It'll be a nice distraction.

93
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.310
- We bloody need one.
- See you, mate.


94
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.980
So I've researched amino acids

95
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.650
as part of my science project,

96
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.950
particularly focusing on the
amino acids in the human body


97
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.350
and also in the food and drink
industry.


98
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:32.560
Um, so this is a skeleton
diagram of an amino acid,


99
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.430
which I connected to
a nitrogen atom,


100
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.370
which is here, silver.
Then we...


101
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.870
That's then in turn connected
to the Alpha carbon atom.


102
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.510
Ah, so, yeah. That's it.

103
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.880
Thanks for listening
to my presentation.


104
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.910
The standard of the whole day

105
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.010
has been very, very high.

106
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.350
Hi.

107
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.050
- How'd you go?
- She was great.


108
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.920
I stumbled over my presentation.

109
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.160
I'm sure it was great.

110
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.090
- Hey.
- Did you hear?


111
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.930
Kate told me. I'm sorry, baby.

112
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.000
We'll talk about it later.

113
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.900
Hedvig.
- Hedvig, it's you!


114
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.770
Hedvig?
- Yeah! Told you so.


115
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.470
Whoo, yeah!

116
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.200
Hedvig! Yeah!

117
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.580
Hang on a sec.

118
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.780
I'm just going to grab
my stuff from the classroom.


119
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.350
Still think they should have
given you first prize.


120
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.750
- Shut up, dad!
- Just saying.


121
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.250
- Hey, guys.
- Adam.


122
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.480
- Hey, Mr Finch.
- Adskis.


123
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.090
What's up, man?

124
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.590
How was practice?

125
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.830
It was good.
I scored two 3-pointers.


126
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.360
- Cool.
- Totes, totes.


127
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.600
- Hedvig got second prize...
- Dad!


128
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.400
I wouldn't bring it up. She's
a bit embarrassed about it.


129
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.200
- Yeah?
- Show him your certificate.


130
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.910
- Check it.
- Yeah, awesome.


131
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.540
- Do you want to hang out?
- Yeah, man. Let's do it.


132
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.080
Yeah, I do.

133
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.810
- Can you take that?
- Yeah, whatevs.


134
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.320
- I'll see you later.
- See you later. See you, man.


135
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.180
Two 3-pointers, man -
that's gnarly.


136
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.990
Yeah, thanks.

137
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.990
It's gnarly!

138
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.720
Say no to drugs.

139
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.490
Oliver?

140
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.300
What?

141
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.970
Banksy is, like, the most
famous street artist


142
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.530
in the world!

143
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.170
Like, he tags all these
warehouses and stuff.


144
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.570
He's pretty good.

145
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.680
Adam! You've got to see this.

146
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.180
What is it?

147
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.880
You have an unfair advantage.

148
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.380
Whoo-hoo!

149
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.650
- Can I have my bike back?
- Nope!


150
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.190
What, you giving up?

151
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.830
This place is awesome.

152
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.560
Come on!

153
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.130
Are you seriously going to
make me chase you again?


154
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.830
If you catch me,
you can kiss me.


155
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.400
You know what?
I'm tapping out.


156
00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.410
Well, lamb chops are discounted.

157
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.840
It's going to be a nightmare
for Hedvig's exams


158
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.450
if we've got to move.

159
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.610
We should wait till the end
of the year, at least.


160
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.210
- Money's going to get tight.
- We'll figure something out.


161
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.460
Fucking hell!

162
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.830
- What?
- It's Christian!


163
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.330
- Who?
- Hey!


164
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.360
- Hey!
- My god!


165
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.770
Is that all you've got to say
for yourself?


166
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.430
- When did you get in?
- I got in this morning.


167
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.400
- No phone call?
- I was about to call you.


168
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.840
- What are you doing tonight?
- I'm meant to be...


169
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.640
Come over for dinner.

170
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.140
Hi.

171
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.340
This is my wife, Charlotte.

172
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.010
Charlotte, this is
my old friend, Christian.


173
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.320
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


174
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.250
He's Henry's son.
He's been overseas.


175
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.950
I haven't been home for awhile.

176
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.550
He's coming for dinner tonight.

177
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.390
I don't want to be any trouble.

178
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.690
- We're having chops.
- Chops.


179
00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.490
- Ow.
- Oh, shit!


180
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.060
- Sorry! Sorry, sorry.
- It's ok, it's alright.


181
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.660
You know what? Let's just wait
till tomorrow, alright?


182
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.530
Ok.

183
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.470
We'll do it on your birthday.

184
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.840
Ok.

185
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.580
Tomorrow.

186
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.800
Going somewhere?

187
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.410
My dad told me never
to get in cars with strangers.


188
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.410
Yeah, right. He sounds like
a pretty smart guy.


189
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.590
- How'd she go?
- She blitzed it.


190
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.860
- Second prize.
- You beauty!


191
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.970
- You went to school with dad?
- I did.


192
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.440
Dad, you remember Christian,
don't you?


193
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.570
- Mr Finch.
- Henry's son.


194
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.940
I taught you
how to play football.


195
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.440
That's right.

196
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.140
- You still rubbish?
- Dad!


197
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.780
- Well, he was.
- Come on, Christian.


198
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.150
He's back in town
for his dad's wedding.


199
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.780
Henry's getting married again?

200
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.920
You know that, dad. I told
you. We've been invited.


201
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.020
He's a little... you know.

202
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.620
So what was dad like as a kid?

203
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.690
- Don't tell her anything.
- Was he naughty?


204
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.800
- About average.
- What did he get up to?


205
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.300
Um, no comment.

206
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.630
- Good man.
- You know, though,


207
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.570
your dad was the golden boy
back in school.


208
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.340
- What?
- He was just like you.


209
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.410
He won all the prizes, topped
the state in three subjects.


210
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.010
Isn't that right, Oliver?

211
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.480
- Can't remember.
- Why did you never tell me?


212
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.210
Let's just get this dinner
going.


213
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.750
That's where
she gets her brains.


214
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.950
Definitely not where
she got her looks.


215
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.550
- Hedvig?
- Yeah?


216
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.250
We got a new friend today.

217
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.160
- Really?
- Not another one, dad.


218
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.590
- Come have a look.
- Want to see something cool?


219
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.390
- What's that?
- Grandad's forest.


220
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.030
- His forest?
- Yeah. Can we show him?


221
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.430
- Dinner will be ready soon.
- Please?


222
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.000
Alright. You've got
t minus 20 minutes.


223
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.760
So you're American.

224
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.310
I'm not sure.

225
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.400
How can you not be sure?

226
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.880
Well, my mother was American.

227
00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.710
My parents met in New York City.

228
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.150
And I just moved around a lot
when I was young.


229
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.690
Then my father decided

230
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.690
I should come back here
and go to school.


231
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.430
I wish I was born
somewhere else.


232
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.720
Yeah, everyone does.

233
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.940
So everything
worked out for you, hey?


234
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.540
Yeah, man.

235
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.700
It was touch and go
for awhile there.


236
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.380
But you're happy?

237
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.880
Fuck, yeah.

238
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.920
Yeah, I think so.

239
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.590
Hedvig is a great girl.

240
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.890
She's the best thing
in my life. She is.


241
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.500
They're all animals
we've been given,


242
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.570
or we found them injured.

243
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.340
There's a lot left to do.

244
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.700
Just making a new pond
for the birds.


245
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.110
We're kind of like
an unofficial RSPCA.


246
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.050
Ah, there she is.

247
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.960
Give her some bread.

248
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.400
Hello!

249
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.000
Hi.

250
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.410
Hey, come here.

251
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.840
It's alright. Sh, sh, sh.

252
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.380
Hello.

253
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.110
I'm Hedvig.

254
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.390
Hey!

255
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.650
Hey.

256
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.920
It's ok. It's ok, it's ok.

257
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.030
Oh. What happened to her?

258
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.030
Henry shot her down.

259
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.790
Peterson saved her.

260
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.000
My father shot that duck down?

261
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.830
Yeah.
Must be losing his touch.


262
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.680
Is she going to be ok?

263
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.650
I don't know. I don't know
if she'll fly again.


264
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.850
Left wing's all buggered up.

265
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.650
Walter seems to be doing fine.

266
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.420
I don't know.

267
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.920
He hasn't really been the same
since he got out of jail.


268
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.790
But your dad's been really
generous.


269
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.730
- Has he?
- He has.


270
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.790
He gave Walter a pension.
He helped us buy this house.


271
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.430
You know, I didn't know that.

272
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.170
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.780
Well, it's not the life
I expected when I was 19,


274
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:46.210
and fuck knows what happens
now I'm out of a job, but...


275
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.880
I'm lucky.

276
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.020
I know that.

277
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.930
Do you think that
he's trying to avoid me?


278
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.230
Of course not.

279
00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.600
I don't think that
he likes me very much.


280
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.570
What's not to like?

281
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.680
If it's just the two of us,
do you want to go upstairs?


282
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.770
Play chess?

283
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.420
Come on.

284
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.920
I think I should probably

285
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.320
keep myself nice
for the wedding night.


286
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.020
Oh! Come on, Henry.

287
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.090
Well, I suppose we could have
a little practice go.


288
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.960
Race you up the stairs.

289
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.800
How's your essay going?

290
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.630
This book is so boring!

291
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.370
My task is basically to invent
reasons why it's interesting,


292
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.940
to make my teacher feel better
about the fact that


293
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.710
he liked it 40 years ago.

294
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.740
- Man, that sucks.
- Yeah.


295
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.240
Another couple of years

296
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.710
and you can do whatever
you want with your life.


297
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.210
- Join the army?
- Except that.


298
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.120
- Become a rally-car driver?
- Or that.


299
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.150
Demolitions expert?

300
00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.820
No way.

301
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.390
So what you're saying is,

302
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.760
I can do whatever
<i>you</i> want me to do?


303
00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.690
No, you've still got
plenty of options.


304
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.800
There's, like, law, medicine,
engineering,


305
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:14.070
law, entertainment law,
criminal law,


306
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.740
my law.

307
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.070
Why have I never met Christian
before?


308
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.240
What do you mean?

309
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.580
Well, you two
used to be best friends.


310
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.250
Did you have a fight
or something?


311
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.920
Well, no. He just left town
after his mum died,


312
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.390
- and I didn't hear from him.
- How'd his mum die?


313
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.250
She killed herself.

314
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.850
Whoa.

315
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.430
That's intense.

316
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.730
But not many people know that,

317
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.030
so I wouldn't go
spreading it around, ok?


318
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.900
I can't even imagine
you or mum dying.


319
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.910
Well, we're not going to.

320
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.770
Well, you will, eventually.

321
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.770
Yeah,
but not for a very long time.


322
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:04.320
Why don't we invite Christian
to my birthday tomorrow?


323
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.820
- Really?
- Yeah. Why not?


324
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.760
- Ok, great.
- Great!


325
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.460
- Great.
- Great!


326
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.230
Alright.

327
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.830
Fist bump.

328
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.030
- Dad?
- Yeah?


329
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.660
Are we going to have to move?

330
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.300
I don't know yet.

331
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.870
Depends where I find a job.

332
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.080
But we are not going anywhere

333
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.280
until you finish
this year's exams.


334
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.850
I don't want you to leave.

335
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.790
Let's not worry about it now.

336
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.950
I'm going to work it out, ok?

337
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.660
- You know why?
- Why?


338
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.290
- 'Cause I'm the best.
- Well...


339
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.830
- What?
- Second-best.


340
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.630
- To who?
- <i>I'm</i> the best.


341
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.530
- Then mum's third?
- Yeah.


342
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.330
The duck is the ruler.

343
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.700
The duck's above us all.

344
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.970
- I love you.
- I love you.


345
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.520
- You're not having one?
- Me? No, no, no.


346
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.280
I'm off it for awhile.

347
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.920
Dry July?

348
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.960
It turns out I just don't
handle it very well.


349
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.960
You're not doing that AA shit,
are you?


350
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.420
- Well, you know...
- Hey, hey - fair enough.


351
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.910
Hey! I tried to call you.

352
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.780
<i>Yeah, sorry.
I had my phone in my bag.</i>


353
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.180
<i>I didn't see it till I got home.</i>

354
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.580
Grace,
was Richard at that party?


355
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.090
<i>- Christian...</i>
- Was he?


356
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.890
<i>I can't control whether or not</i>

357
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.630
<i>he comes to a party, 
Christian.</i>

358
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.960
I'm really glad that
you're coming.


359
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.290
<i>Yeah.</i>

360
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.860
Grace...

361
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.770
Hold on.

362
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.970
Ok.

363
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.640
Can you see me?

364
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.140
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

365
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.880
Grace...

366
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:16.980
..I really think you should
move back in


367
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.020
when we get back to the states.

368
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.050
<i>- Christian...</i>
- It's been long enough.


369
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.890
<i>Let's talk about it
when I get there.</i>


370
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.090
I have not had a drink
in two months.


371
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.960
<i>That's good,
but it's not just that.</i>


372
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.960
Hey, hey, hey, hey -

373
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.570
I'm happier now.
I like the guy I am now.


374
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.270
<i>What happens when everything
goes back to normal</i>


375
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.970
<i>and you fall back into
old habits?</i>


376
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.640
It won't. I can guarantee you

377
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.910
things will not go back
to normal. I promise you that.


378
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.580
We were hoping to source

379
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.880
most of the ingredients locally,

380
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.020
but we've lost
most of the suppliers.


381
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.420
Is this because of the mill?

382
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.020
Of course it is.

383
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.060
What are we going to do?

384
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.090
Find someone in the city.

385
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.000
Can we do that,
is there enough time?


386
00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.930
Theoretically, but
it's going to cost a lot more.


387
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.500
Henry?

388
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.170
It doesn't matter
how much it costs.


389
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.840
Organize it.

390
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.010
- Oliver.
- Mr Nielson.


391
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.020
I'm here to pick up Christian.

392
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.450
We're going away for the night.

393
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.420
You do remember we've got
a rehearsal in the morning?


394
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.150
A rehearsal? Yeah.

395
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.230
Great having him back, isn't it?

396
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.200
Yeah. I'm... I'm looking
forward to the wedding.


397
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.960
Oh, yeah.

398
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.340
So...

399
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.180
- What?
- Where are they?


400
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.450
If my brother finds out
I stole these, he'll kill me.


401
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.090
I don't want to sound like
a pussy,


402
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.030
but what if there's snakes
and shit?


403
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.530
You sound like a pussy, Adam.

404
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.300
Shut up!

405
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.480
Have you done this before?

406
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.220
Not telling.

407
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.950
You have. Who with?

408
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.960
Just forget about it.

409
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.530
Um, wait.

410
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.030
Hey, slow down.

411
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.340
- What's wrong?
- Just... I...


412
00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.340
- It's ok.
- You're hurting me.


413
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.410
- I'm just...
- Hang on. Just stop a second.


414
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.340
- It's ok.
- Just hang on a second.


415
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.040
- I'm just...
- Adam...


416
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.580
Fucking hell! I'm just...

417
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.480
- Stop for a second.
- Oh, fuck it!


418
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.720
Fuck it.

419
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.450
Adam!

420
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.190
Adam?

421
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.660
Adam?

422
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.610
Hedvig?

423
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.520
Hedvig.

424
00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.630
I'm ok.

425
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.170
I've been looking for you.

426
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.900
I'm fine.

427
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.600
What happened?

428
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.140
I'm saying, I'm fine.

429
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.780
You must be freezing.

430
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.430
I'll make you a vegie burger.
How's that sound?


431
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.940
It'll be a three-course meal.

432
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.480
It'll be soup, then the sort
of steak or chicken choice.


433
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.610
You're always
thinking about the food!


434
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.150
- Name plates.
- I haven't seen the menu.


435
00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.790
Alright.
Well, that's it for me.


436
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.720
I'll say goodnight.

437
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.130
Goodnight, dad.

438
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.590
How many people -

439
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.100
No-one from the town
except you guys.


440
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.500
He didn't write the invite list!

441
00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.370
We're only going
'cause of Walter.


442
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.900
The whole town's falling
apart, he's trying to party.


443
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:14.810
Well, he's never much cared
for other people's opinions.


444
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.710
Must have been tough growing
up with him as your old man.


445
00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.310
How'd he meet her?

446
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.610
She was his housekeeper.

447
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.420
You were his housekeeper!

448
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.920
- Only for a little while.
- Really?


449
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.120
That's why she came up here.

450
00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.930
Yes, you are a lucky bastard.

451
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.060
You wouldn't find a woman like
that in this town, no way!


452
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.960
I mean,
apart from present company.


453
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:46.100
Personally, I think she could
do a bit better, mate.


454
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.160
Do you want a hand?

455
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.890
I'm almost done.

456
00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.670
I had no idea
you worked for my father.


457
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.240
Yeah.

458
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.540
- Then you knew my mother?
- Yeah, I did.


459
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.850
Awful thing,
what happened to her.


460
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.580
Yeah, yeah.

461
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.260
How long did you work there?

462
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.030
Um, half a year.
A year, maybe.


463
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.260
Really?

464
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.560
And why did you leave?

465
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.530
Oliver and I got together,

466
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:52.410
and I started getting some
substitute work at the school.


467
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.280
It's just... it's funny,
my father never mentioned you.


468
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.680
He didn't?

469
00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.410
No.

470
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.610
I'd better get these things
packed up.


471
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.530
- I met Charlotte.
- Hm?


472
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.600
I didn't realise
that's who it was.


473
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.610
- What are you talking about?
- I'd pictured her differently


474
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.610
- from all mom's stories.
- Christian...


475
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.510
What are you guys talking about?

476
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.010
- We'll talk about this later.
- Does Oliver know?


477
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.180
- What is going on?
- Anna,


478
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.280
could you just
give us a moment, please?


479
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.680
Excuse me?

480
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.350
Just give us a moment, please.

481
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.460
Fine.
I'll have a cigarette anyway.


482
00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.310
It was a complicated time,
Christian.


483
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.250
I don't expect you
to understand that.


484
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.050
Your mother was
seeing other people too.


485
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.020
She wasn't seeing anyone!
She was trying to see you.


486
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.860
We were keeping up appearances.

487
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:19.460
It hadn't been a relationship
for years. Can you understand?


488
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.490
- You never bothered to try.
- I did try.


489
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.960
I stuck with her.
I knew she needed me.


490
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:28.100
- It was a compromise for me.
- She needed you...


491
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.770
..And you gave up on her.

492
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.740
'Cause I'd had enough.
I was exhausted.


493
00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.510
I couldn't
keep looking after her.


494
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.410
Day in, day out,
taking care of her.


495
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.310
And I wanted...
I wanted to be happy again.


496
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.080
Oh, you wanted to be happy?
What about mom?


497
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.850
What about me, when am I
going to get my turn?


498
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.920
Anna,
sorry for ruining your dinner.


499
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.160
Christian, please.

500
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.800
- Christian!
- What?


501
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:03.770
There's not a day I don't wish
your mother was still alive.


502
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.500
Good for you.

503
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.510
What's going on?

504
00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.980
Nothing.

505
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.250
Well, it didn't sound
like nothing.


506
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.490
I'll sleep in the other room
so I don't wake you.


507
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.290
- Henry!
- I'm sorry!


508
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.460
- Henry!
- Anna, just leave me alone.


509
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.420
What are you doing?

510
00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:52.020
Um...

511
00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.120
..I just made a dummy
for everyone who's left.


512
00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.050
Oh. Cool.

513
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.390
Hi.

514
00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.120
Yeah, hi.

515
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.300
Can you guess who this is?

516
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.270
Um...

517
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.040
I don't know. Is it Colin?

518
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.740
No 
- Brett.

519
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.740
You need to give him
some red hair.


520
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.600
Oh, my god!
That's a great idea.


521
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.010
- I'm sorry.
- Hm?


522
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.820
About... You know.

523
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.590
It's ok.

524
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.190
Yeah, that looks better.

525
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.730
I've always wanted to do this.

526
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.970
- You decapitated Brett!
- Yeah.


527
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.040
- What have you done?
- It's a memorial.


528
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.340
Yeah, for all the kids
who left town.


529
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.410
It's not bad.

530
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.250
So, before we get started,
I'd like to remind everyone,


531
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.980
assignments 7a and b are due
a week on Friday.


532
00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.650
Do you want to hang out
after school?


533
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.690
Yeah, ok.

534
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.990
- I've got a surprise.
- Ok.


535
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.160
Hey, lovebirds!

536
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.580
Where did you get this?

537
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.280
It's my grandad's.

538
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.750
Here.

539
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.120
- Do you know how to use it?
- Yeah.


540
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.430
You want a go?

541
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.170
- Yeah, alright.
- Yeah?


542
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.470
Yeah.

543
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.840
Alright.

544
00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.510
You get it in your shoulder.
Yeah, like that.


545
00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.240
And then cock the hammer.

546
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:04.110
That's it.

547
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.260
That's intense.

548
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.020
Uh-huh!

549
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.200
Hey, did you smell
Mr Peters' breath today?


550
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.900
Yes. It was like
something had died in there,


551
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:26.910
like a homeless guy had set up
his camp in his mouth.


552
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.170
Exactly what it smelled like.

553
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.380
What?

554
00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.950
Oh, just got a job interview.

555
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.220
Already?

556
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.390
Yeah, just some factory
outside the city.


557
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.560
- That's great!
- Yeah.


558
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.170
How about you take a raincheck
on that marking?


559
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.900
Why?

560
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.000
Well, you know,
I thought maybe we could...


561
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.270
I'm busy.

562
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.450
I know, I know, it's just that
you're always busy. And...


563
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.210
I figure it's, like, an hour
before Hedvig comes back.


564
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.020
What was that for?

565
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.020
- Just wanted to.
- Get out of here!


566
00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.150
Hey, duck.

567
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.040
What were you doing with that?

568
00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.910
- You scared me!
- What were you doing?


569
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.580
- Just shooting some cans.
- Where?


570
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.180
Down at the old factory.

571
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:22.090
Next time, you ask me first.
Do you understand?


572
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.660
Yeah.

573
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.360
I don't want you handling
that gun without supervision.


574
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.090
Sorry, grandad.

575
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.530
- Promise?
- Promise.


576
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.260
Ok.

577
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.670
Seen the duck?

578
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.130
What's she doing?

579
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.010
Do you think she'll ever
be able to fly again?


580
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.580
She's got plenty of
determination,


581
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:51.310
I'll give her that.

582
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.820
Hello?

583
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.400
Anyone home?

584
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.730
Parents!

585
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.180
Parents?

586
00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:20.680
What time is it?

587
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.720
- Ten to nine.
- Ah, shit.


588
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.320
Yeah. Dad, I can see your bum.

589
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.020
Sorry, sorry.

590
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.660
- Sorry, we fell asleep.
Mm-hm!


591
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.090
No, we were just having a nap.

592
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.460
- Sure! Nap.
- Just a nap!


593
00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:35.630
Gross!

594
00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.460
Busted.

595
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:40.170
- So busted!
- Yeah.


596
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.930
She saw my bum.

597
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.050
Where's grace?

598
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.960
Christian?

599
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.930
Tell me what's going on.

600
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.440
Not now. Please.

601
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.040
We're getting married
in two days.


602
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.840
Anna...

603
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:29.080
We don't keep things
from each other.


604
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.520
Why didn't you tell me?

605
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:40.920
I've never told anyone.

606
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.490
Well, I don't want to be <i>anyone.</i>

607
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.900
I'd never do that to you.

608
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.100
Well, I won't stick around
if you do.


609
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.510
I know.

610
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.680
<i>Hey, mate. What's up?</i>

611
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.370
Hedgehog? Brekkie.

612
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.410
Who's that?

613
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.120
It's Christian.

614
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.720
What's he doing here?

615
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.120
He's coming to the city
with me for the interview.


616
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.120
- Why's he going?
- He called last night.


617
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.430
- He wanted to see me.
- Why?


618
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.930
I don't know.

619
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.300
- He didn't say?
- What's wrong?


620
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.030
Nothing.

621
00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.000
Hedvig, you're going to be late.

622
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.870
I haven't even eaten breakfast.

623
00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.440
- Hurry up, then.

624
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:02.140
- Can you answer it, baby?
- Sure.


625
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.010
- Don't do it for her.

626
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.280
- Hi.
- Hi.


627
00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.080
I thought I'd lend him a suit.

628
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.920
Oh. That's nice of you.

629
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.620
Mr Finch.

630
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.390
Who are you?

631
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.890
It's Christian...

632
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.060
Dad! He came camping with us.

633
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.730
..Henry's son.

634
00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.330
Oh. I taught you how to
play football. You were crap.


635
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.640
Hey, Christian. I overslept.
We're running late. Bye!


636
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.670
Bye!

637
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.880
Look after Oliver, won't you?

638
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:38.740
He hasn't been in the city
for years.


639
00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:40.250
I'll do my best.

640
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.710
- You ready?
- I am.


641
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.920
Hey!

642
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:44.480
Toast kiss! You're beautiful.

643
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.680
- I made you lunch.
- Yeah.


644
00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.230
<i>Hello?</i>

645
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.200
I need to talk to you.

646
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:07.570
What are you doing
in town today?


647
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.780
Just getting some more
chicken wire.


648
00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.280
Bloody rabbits -

649
00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:16.040
they're tunnelling
under the walls again.


650
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.700
Where are you going?

651
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:41.970
Is Adam coming to school
today? The bus is waiting.


652
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.540
Better go and have a word
to Hedvig, eh?


653
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.250
Dad got a job up north.

654
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.420
What?

655
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.050
I'm sorry.

656
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.460
When are you going to come back?

657
00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:08.570
I don't know. They found me
a place at a school up there.


658
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.300
Hedvig?

659
00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.400
Why didn't you tell me?

660
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.170
I'm sorry.

661
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:31.720
They all look so young.

662
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.530
We used to look like that?

663
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.460
I hardly remember being here,
hey.


664
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.000
Do you remember how hammered
we used to get?


665
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.500
At least you got laid, you know?

666
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.340
You experienced it, you had fun.

667
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:50.440
I wasted my time chasing
Erica flowers for two years.


668
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.540
What happened to her?

669
00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:54.410
She turned out to be a lesbian.

670
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.420
- You're kidding me?
- No.


671
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.350
I spent three years convinced
she was playing hard-to-get.


672
00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.190
We should hurry up.
Interview's in 20 minutes.


673
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.490
Yeah. I'm just
going to hang out here.


674
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.790
Really?

675
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.090
Maybe check out a few
of the old haunts.


676
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.960
- I'll come find you.
- Do that.


677
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.660
Wish me luck.

678
00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.400
Good luck.

679
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.380
Thanks for coming.

680
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.810
That's ok.

681
00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.060
Christian knows, doesn't he?

682
00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.220
He may not say anything.

683
00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.730
I can't lose them, Henry.

684
00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:00.980
I'll try and talk to Christian.

685
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.410
He's in the city with Oliver.

686
00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.220
I'll call him.

687
00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.770
Excuse me? Just one more.

688
00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:42.050
Well, I'm sure as shit
not getting that job.


689
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.760
There were, like,
ten 20-year-olds


690
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.390
sitting in the waiting room,
psyching me out.


691
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.930
What happened?

692
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.170
I don't have to be
on my best behaviour anymore.


693
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.900
Grace isn't coming.

694
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.940
She what?

695
00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.810
She's done this before.

696
00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.540
What?

697
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.840
Just disappeared without notice.

698
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.650
Fuck. That's not good, hey?

699
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.620
Yeah.

700
00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.930
She's been staying
at a friend's house.


701
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.930
We've been on a break.

702
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.860
Hey, do you want one of these?

703
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.370
- Ah...
- Come on.


704
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.570
Alright, fuck it. Let's do it.

705
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.300
Oh, we're going to do it.

706
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.170
Like old times,
we're going to do it.


707
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.210
Carl,
I need you to duplicate this.


708
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.740
I'm going to take one of those.

709
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:39.570
- Here. Right there.
- Cheers.


710
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.180
I'm sorry about that
interview. 20-year-olds!


711
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.950
The problem is, I get in there
and I'm stressed out.


712
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.680
Cheers.

713
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:55.960
- Alright.
- Garçon!


714
00:46:55.990 --> 00:47:00.300
I think I may have turned
Erica flowers


715
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.430
because of my natural repulsion.

716
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:12.680
See that?

717
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:16.520
The wing's coming on strong.

718
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:20.750
I reckon she might just
make it back up into the air.


719
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:25.850
You alright, love?

720
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.320
Why did you go to jail?

721
00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.030
I did a bad thing.

722
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.470
What did you do?

723
00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:46.650
I found a way to hide
a whole heap of money


724
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.210
that we were supposed to pay.

725
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.920
You and Mr Nielson?

726
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.650
Yeah.

727
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.760
Why didn't<i>he</i> go to jail?

728
00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:01.130
Well, Henry's name
wasn't on the documents,


729
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.760
and there was no point
of both of us going down.


730
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:06.530
Why'd you do it?

731
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.970
I don't know.

732
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.970
Greed, loyalty to a friend.

733
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.980
<i>And I wanted to make
a good life for your father.</i>


734
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:21.550
I was sitting here.

735
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:25.020
They'd just convicted my dad.

736
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.750
It was all over the news,

737
00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.790
and he was on the TV
just up there.


738
00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.960
And
there was this group of guys.


739
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.590
I was drinking back there,

740
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.930
and one of them
just kept shouting out,


741
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.400
'isn't that your dad?'
But I ignored him.


742
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.470
I kept drinking.

743
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.770
But the fucking prick, man,

744
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.540
the fucking prick
just kept shouting


745
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:50.280
till the whole pub
was listening,


746
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.940
and I turned to him.

747
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.250
I wanted to punch
his fucking face in.


748
00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.380
I looked up at the TV.

749
00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:01.820
I looked at my dad
straight in the face...


750
00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:05.820
..And I said, 'I've got
no idea who that guy is.'


751
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.860
and then I dropped out of uni.

752
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.600
I never would have met Charlotte

753
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.500
if I hadn't moved back home.

754
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.670
Look at Hedvig.
She's a genius.


755
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.410
I know - 'shut up.'

756
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.140
I'm meant to say that
'cause I'm her dad,


757
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.450
but she's a genius,
and all the stuff...


758
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.180
She's a very bright girl.

759
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:33.690
All the stuff I never got to
do, she's going to do it -


760
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.650
she's going to do it.

761
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:40.460
Oliver, there's something that
I really need to...


762
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:42.130
What are you guys doing in here?

763
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.630
We were just reminiscing.

764
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.360
This is, um, this is Oliver.

765
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:47.870
Hi, Oliver.

766
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.440
Hi.
This is my friend Christian.


767
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:53.440
We used to go to uni here.

768
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.640
What do you do now?

769
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:59.540
Christian is kind of a
hot-shot businessman.


770
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:01.250
I don't like to brag.

771
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.580
What about you, what do you do?

772
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:08.090
I am just a local fella,
just from around here,


773
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.220
- local guy.
- You don't sound like one.


774
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:15.120
Oh, really? Good. I try
pretty hard to stave that off.


775
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.690
No, no, no.

776
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:22.000
- On both 1...
- 2...


777
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.760
- 2...
- 3...


778
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.710
Horse.

779
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.670
- Dolphin!
- Nah, nah, nah!


780
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.680
- Dolphin.
- Dolphins?


781
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.110
We're not playing dolphins.

782
00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.650
That was impressive.

783
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.550
- It's impressive!
- <i>I'm</i> impressive.


784
00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.320
I'm out of my league.

785
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:43.820
Where are you guys staying
tonight?


786
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.390
That's a good question.

787
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.360
We were actually meant to be
home a few hours ago.


788
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:51.860
When?

789
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:55.930
About, like, five hours or so.

790
00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.970
You should stay the night
with us.


791
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.340
We're actually married men.

792
00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:07.070
Does it matter?

793
00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.480
To me, it does. It does!

794
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.650
To me, it does.

795
00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.680
What about you?

796
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:20.220
Are you alright?

797
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:32.300
I'm sorry!

798
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:33.840
I'm out of practice.

799
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:37.100
I'm about to fall over myself.

800
00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:42.080
What time is it?

801
00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:43.810
Um...

802
00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.550
..It's quarter to two.

803
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.720
We got to get back.

804
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:55.760
Listen, I'm going to
drink some water...


805
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.030
- We need a plan.
- I'll drink some water,


806
00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.830
and we'll give it, like,
an hour.


807
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.030
We'll give it two hours.

808
00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.140
We need a plan.

809
00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:07.540
Come here, mate.

810
00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:09.600
I've missed you, mate.

811
00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:12.840
- Oliver?
- Yeah?


812
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:15.250
I don't want to ever grow up.

813
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.480
- It's too late, mate.
- Let's never grow up.


814
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.210
It's too late.

815
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.760
Where the fuck have you been?

816
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.300
Oh, my god,
you look great, Anna.


817
00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.640
We have to start.

818
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:45.040
Just give him a few minutes.

819
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:06.790
What happened?

820
00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:10.930
<i>I couldn't get on the plane.</i>

821
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:14.410
Grace, you could have called me.

822
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.140
<i>I just wasn't ready.</i>

823
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.810
<i>Christian, there's something
I need to talk to you about.</i>


824
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.410
I'm running late
for my dad's wedding, so...


825
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.150
<i>Oh.</i>

826
00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.890
What is it?

827
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.520
<i>I can call you later.</i>

828
00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.530
No, you can't call me later.
You can tell me now.


829
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.690
What's going on, what is it?

830
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.400
<i>We should talk later.</i>

831
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:40.570
Grace, let's talk about it now.

832
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.600
- What's going on?
<i>- No, let's not do this now.</i>


833
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:45.470
What?

834
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:49.240
<i>You and I were never right
for each other, Christian.</i>


835
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:53.080
<i>I could never figure you out,
and you never let me in.</i>


836
00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:56.180
<i>- I just...</i>
- Don't do this.


837
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:57.680
Not now.

838
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:59.450
<i>I've been seeing Richard again.</i>

839
00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.880
Don't do this, don't do this.

840
00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.190
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

841
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.700
What are you telling me, that
you've been fucking Richard


842
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:12.800
while I was waiting
for you to arrive,


843
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:15.330
calling you every hour?
You've been fucking Richard?


844
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.570
Is that what you're telling me
right now?


845
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.540
<i>It wasn't...</i>

846
00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:23.340
I did everything for you.

847
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.070
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

848
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.010
Stop saying that.

849
00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.110
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- Stop saying that!


850
00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.680
Don't say that. I'm sure you
think you should be sorry.


851
00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.850
You're a fucking liar.

852
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.990
Come on, we're going to start.

853
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.800
What are you doing?

854
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:32.380
Congratulations.

855
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:34.950
Let's do this.

856
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.750
To have and to hold...

857
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.520
To have and to hold.

858
00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.990
- ..For better or for worse...
- For better or for worse.


859
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:44.060
..For richer or for poorer...

860
00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.790
For richer or for poorer.

861
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.790
..In sickness and in health...

862
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.690
In sickness and in health.

863
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.800
..Till death do us part.

864
00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:53.560
Till death do us part.

865
00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:56.270
Christian, please come forward
with the rings.


866
00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:58.700
Christian?

867
00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:00.430
The rings.

868
00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.420
Dance hall days

869
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:30.330
Christian! Come on, dance.
Dance with me, come on.


870
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.800
Right, let's go.

871
00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:53.320
Hey, hey!

872
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.060
Come on, baby!

873
00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:21.310
♪ Salsa

874
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:01.890
that was lovely, wasn't it?

875
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.590
You think?

876
00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:06.300
Yeah, it was beautiful.

877
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:09.930
You didn't feel even a tinge
of jealousy?


878
00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.570
What are you doing?

879
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.710
Have you told Oliver?

880
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.610
You haven't, have you?

881
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:24.640
How could you do that
to the man you love?


882
00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:34.760
He was an absolute mess.
His father was in jail.


883
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:37.230
I wanted to tell him.
I really wanted to tell him,


884
00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.300
but I had to wait
for a better time.


885
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:41.670
But you never did, did you?

886
00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:46.430
You don't think it's cruel to
let him keep living that lie?


887
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:48.870
You've seen our family.

888
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.740
Do you think
there's something wrong


889
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:53.010
with the way that we live?

890
00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:56.210
Please just leave us alone.

891
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.280
We're happy. Just let us be.

892
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:03.250
You should tell him tonight.
He deserves to know.


893
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.520
You do not need to be scared
of the truth.


894
00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:13.590
You don't need to be
scared of this, Charlotte!


895
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.800
Let's go.
Hedvig needs to be in bed.


896
00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:20.370
Can't we stay a little longer?

897
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.170
It's way past your bedtime.

898
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.640
Since when do I have a bedtime?

899
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:26.040
- Bedtime? She's not 12.
- I'm not 12!


900
00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:27.950
You need to be in school
tomorrow.


901
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.450
You coming?

902
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.420
I'm going to stay a bit longer.

903
00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:33.920
- How will you get home?
- I'll walk.


904
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:35.420
Why don't you just come now?

905
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:37.420
Christian's leaving
in a couple of days.


906
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.360
- Can't you see him tomorrow?
- What's wrong with you?


907
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.690
Ok.
I'm going to stay with you.


908
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.660
- You don't have to.
- I want to stay.


909
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:47.600
You do want to stay? Alright.
You're going home, Hedvig.


910
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:50.460
- Can we stay longer?
- Mum and dad can.


911
00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.910
Walter,
can you take Hedvig home?


912
00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.410
Yeah, no worries.

913
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.280
Is this where you've been
all night, dad?


914
01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:05.320
Give me the bottle.

915
01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.690
- I can't do that, sir.
- Give me that fucking bottle.


916
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.420
Sorry, sir.

917
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:14.590
Hey, good man.

918
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.230
Go fuck yourself.

919
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.390
Hey, how was<i>your</i> night?

920
01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:00.170
I can't find Christian.

921
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.070
Probably gone to bed.
Let's go home.


922
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.840
I'll just look inside the house.

923
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:05.340
Come on, Oliver!

924
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.770
I'll be one second. Promise.

925
01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:11.110
One second.

926
01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.460
Christian!

927
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.230
Christian?

928
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.860
You ok?

929
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.040
Do you know what this room is?

930
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:15.480
How much have you had to drink?

931
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:17.950
Guess.

932
01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.720
I don't know, mate.

933
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:21.510
Go on, guess.

934
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.620
Mate,
we should get you some water.


935
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:38.470
This...
This is where she did it.


936
01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.780
She called me five times
that night.


937
01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:52.080
I thought it was just another
one of her... you know.


938
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:56.990
And her last call was

939
01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.290
and I didn't call her back.

940
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.260
And I haven't been in here
since.


941
01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.070
Oliver?

942
01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.800
Yeah?

943
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:15.700
Grace...

944
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:18.770
Grace left me.

945
01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.440
Fuck.

946
01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.190
You alright?

947
01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.920
No, not really.

948
01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.270
What?

949
01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.470
- Uh...
- What is it?


950
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.970
Charlotte hasn't told you,
has she?


951
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:53.370
Told me what?

952
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.220
I didn't want to be the one
to do this.


953
01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.500
Get him off, get him off!

954
01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.270
You fucking prick!

955
01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.980
Get him out!

956
01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.610
Can you help me? Henry!

957
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.420
Oliver!

958
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:06.120
Stay away from me.

959
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:08.150
Oliver, please. Please!

960
01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.720
Get your fucking hands off me!

961
01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.460
Why didn't you tell me?

962
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.890
I'm sorry.

963
01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.500
You remember what it was like.

964
01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:27.070
We'd only just started
seeing each other.


965
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.770
You were drunk half the time,

966
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.740
and there was barely
a relationship.


967
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:32.910
That gives you an excuse
to fuck someone else?


968
01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.450
- No! I just...
- Were you in love with him?


969
01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.440
Were you in love with him?

970
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.380
Yes.

971
01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.690
I thought
you were in love with me.


972
01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.630
Not yet. Well, not really.

973
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.370
Not really?

974
01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.100
I'm sorry.

975
01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.940
Oh, fucking hell!

976
01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:06.380
- I'm in love with you now.
- Get off me!


977
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:08.950
Get your fucking hands off me.

978
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.520
- How many people know?
- No-one.


979
01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:14.820
How many people know?
Don't fucking lie to me.


980
01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:16.550
I'm sorry.

981
01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.020
I'm so sorry.

982
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:26.100
You let me live in this town,
with that man.


983
01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:27.600
You let me work for him.

984
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.200
I took his fucking money!

985
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:33.140
- How could you do that to me?
- I'm sorry.


986
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:36.270
How could you fucking do that
to someone you love?


987
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.580
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I'm an idiot.


988
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:40.540
Don't say that.

989
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:43.840
- Don't say that.
- I'm a fucking idiot.


990
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:49.550
If you were in love with him,
why'd you stay with me?


991
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.050
Oliver, I...

992
01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.800
'Cause when his wife
killed herself,


993
01:06:57.830 --> 01:06:59.830
he wouldn't see you anymore,

994
01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.430
and I was the second-best
option, right?


995
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:09.840
Jesus.

996
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:20.810
Oh, Jesus.

997
01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.850
Oliver, stop it.

998
01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.550
Oh, Jesus.

999
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:27.990
Oh, Jesus!

1000
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:31.230
Oliver?

1001
01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.160
Please tell me it wasn't
'cause you were pregnant.


1002
01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:40.870
Charlotte, tell me it wasn't
'cause you were pregnant.


1003
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.310
- Oliver, please stop.
- Answer the question.


1004
01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.810
I'm begging you.

1005
01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.740
Answer the fucking question!

1006
01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:48.980
Yes, I was pregnant.

1007
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.420
With Hedvig?

1008
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:58.150
Yes.

1009
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.620
- So...
- Oliver...


1010
01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:07.460
- Please.
- Let go of me!


1011
01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.160
Oliver!

1012
01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:14.270
Oliver!

1013
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.300
Charlotte,
I didn't know about Hedvig.


1014
01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.140
You're disgusting.

1015
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:22.840
I'm sorry.

1016
01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:26.310
Don't you dare tell Hedvig.

1017
01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.140
Hey.

1018
01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:53.900
Hey, um...

1019
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.840
Are you ok? Where are you?

1020
01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.990
Hey, Ollie?

1021
01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.990
Why don't you just come home,
son?


1022
01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.700
I'll be there soon.

1023
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:22.930
Um, he's staying at the motel,

1024
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.940
and he wants me to bring him
some clothes.


1025
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:27.240
I'll go.

1026
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:29.610
No, I don't think
it's a good idea, love.


1027
01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.170
Look, don't worry.

1028
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.210
I'll have a good talk with
him. He'll be home.


1029
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.940
What's going on?

1030
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.190
Why is dad staying at the motel?

1031
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.090
Hedvig,
why don't you have a shower,


1032
01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.820
and we'll take the bus together?

1033
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:48.560
Mum, what's happening?

1034
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:53.130
- Everything's fine.
- Hurry, you'll be late.


1035
01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.980
Your mother left me once
for someone else.


1036
01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.890
She told me she was in love
with this painter fellow.


1037
01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.320
He taught her life drawing
or something.


1038
01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.960
She said she was sorry

1039
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:03.200
and that she'd never really
loved me.


1040
01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.900
You hungry?

1041
01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:11.440
No.

1042
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:18.140
You want to talk about it?

1043
01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.720
No.

1044
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:29.260
So I threw myself into my work.

1045
01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:33.330
I started the business
with Henry.


1046
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.100
And then one day,
your mother came back.


1047
01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:43.770
He'd gotten bored with her,
he'd moved on to someone else.


1048
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.710
So I said that
I'd forget all about it,


1049
01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.850
and we should start again.

1050
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.780
And so we did.

1051
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.120
You were born
a couple of years later.


1052
01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:03.430
I only had a few years left
with your mother


1053
01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.190
before she died but...

1054
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:11.160
..They were a few
very good years.


1055
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:16.240
I can't forgive her.

1056
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:19.770
Why not?

1057
01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.510
I can't trust her again.

1058
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.250
Of course you can.

1059
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.790
That was a long time ago.

1060
01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:34.250
You were different people then.

1061
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:38.960
Everyone's got a story
like this, Oliver.


1062
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:41.960
It's as old as the hills.

1063
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:45.170
Hey, Greg's called in sick.

1064
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.740
I need you
to take his 11 o'clock.


1065
01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:50.200
- History?
- Yeah, just for today.


1066
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:52.970
That's Hedvig's class.

1067
01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:55.940
What's wrong with that?

1068
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.330
On the one hand, we have
the industrial revolution,


1069
01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:14.100
and on the other, we have
the romantic movement in art.


1070
01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:18.030
- Er, in this painting...
- What did you do?


1071
01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.280
Turner wasn't the only painter

1072
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:27.440
to represent
a post-enlightenment...


1073
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:29.380
Tell me what you did.

1074
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:32.050
In this painting
by Joseph Wright...


1075
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.820
- Did you cheat on him?

1076
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:36.550
Is that what you did?

1077
01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.360
Hedvig, can we have this
conversation outside, please?


1078
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:43.030
- You did, didn't you?
- Hedvig, stop it.


1079
01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.960
- Stop it now.
- You cheated on him.


1080
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:46.860
Shut up! Stop laughing.

1081
01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:48.930
- Hedvig...
- Stop laughing!


1082
01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.300
- It's not funny.
- Hedvig, stop it.


1083
01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:52.940
I hate you!

1084
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:55.130
- Outside, now!
- Fuck!


1085
01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.410
Shut the fuck up!

1086
01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.180
Hedvig, come back here!

1087
01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.080
Hedvig!

1088
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:26.940
What do you want?

1089
01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:29.130
Walter, please.

1090
01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:35.570
I'm sorry about everything
that's happened.


1091
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:50.390
I want to set up a trust
for Hedvig.


1092
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:53.700
You what?

1093
01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:55.530
It's only fair.

1094
01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.500
It's out in the open.

1095
01:15:57.530 --> 01:16:01.300
She deserves, you all deserve,
a fair share.


1096
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:03.710
I want to make sure

1097
01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.940
you're all comfortable.

1098
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:09.010
Fuck off, Henry.

1099
01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:12.120
Walt...

1100
01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:15.150
..I understand that
you're angry at me,


1101
01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.520
but Hedvig shouldn't have to
suffer because of that.


1102
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:20.020
She won't.

1103
01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:22.190
We'll make sure of that.

1104
01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:29.130
You've done enough damage
to this family,


1105
01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.340
so why don't you fuck off
out of this town


1106
01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:35.370
and leave us
to pick up the pieces?


1107
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.590
You know what the miracle is,
Henry?


1108
01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:54.120
Hedvig doesn't bear one trace
of you. Not one, thank god.


1109
01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:56.630
She's Oliver's daughter.

1110
01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.020
Stay out of our lives!

1111
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.710
Hi.

1112
01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.280
Hey.

1113
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:22.850
Aren't you supposed to be
at school?


1114
01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.580
Yeah.

1115
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:28.990
Then you're waiting
for your dad?


1116
01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.330
Yeah.

1117
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.260
He's not in there.

1118
01:17:37.330 --> 01:17:40.470
Maybe he's gone back home.

1119
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.400
No, his stuff's still
in there. I looked.


1120
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.390
Does your duck have a name?

1121
01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:00.960
It's a duck, Christian.
Why would it have a name?


1122
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:04.830
What, so you're just going to
keep saying 'it'?


1123
01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:08.330
Yeah, or 'you' when
I'm talking to it.


1124
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:15.510
I think you should
come up with a name for her.


1125
01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.200
Like what?

1126
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:19.570
Lucky.

1127
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.310
Why?

1128
01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:28.210
Because my father shot her,
and she survived.


1129
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:36.160
Lucky.

1130
01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:38.190
Lucky ducky.

1131
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.630
You're a dag.

1132
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:51.240
Yeah, I really am.

1133
01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.550
You want to kiss me?

1134
01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.150
What?

1135
01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.890
It's ok.

1136
01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.790
I've had sex before.
I know what to do.


1137
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.860
And I'm not going to
tell anybody.


1138
01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:14.360
No! What are you doing?
No! Jesus Christ, Hedvig!


1139
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:16.170
- I'm sorry.
- No, no...


1140
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.670
I'm in idiot. I'm sorry!

1141
01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.370
- No, you're not.
- I'm such an idiot!


1142
01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.510
- Stupid idiot! I'm sorry.
- Hedvig. Hedvig?


1143
01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.570
You don't understand.

1144
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.750
Tell me what's going on.

1145
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:44.660
Please?

1146
01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:46.390
Tell me. Please.

1147
01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.580
Dad?

1148
01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.220
No, dad!

1149
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:46.950
Dad, please!

1150
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:57.230
Dad!

1151
01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.340
I can't talk to you right now.

1152
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:01.570
Please come home.

1153
01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.500
Christian told me.

1154
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:07.810
It's ok.

1155
01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:10.150
No, it's not.

1156
01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.150
Can't you just pretend that
you never found out?


1157
01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.150
No.

1158
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.750
I'm<i>your</i> daughter!

1159
01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:20.060
- No, you're not.
- You brought me up!


1160
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:22.320
No, you're his daughter.

1161
01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:25.530
And I think you should be glad.

1162
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.160
He's very successful.

1163
01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:29.500
He's rich. He'll make sure
you have a good life.


1164
01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:31.570
I don't want to be
anyone else's daughter.


1165
01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.370
You don't have a choice.

1166
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.170
I just want our family
back together!


1167
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.640
It's ok.

1168
01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:40.910
It's ok.
Your mum will look after you.


1169
01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:43.410
No. Not mum, you.

1170
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.380
Dad, why can't you just pretend?

1171
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:49.490
No!

1172
01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.820
- No, dad. I really need you.
- I have to go.


1173
01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:53.890
- I really need you.
- I have to go, Hedvig.


1174
01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.990
- Let go of me, ok?
- I'm begging you.


1175
01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:57.690
I can't look at you!

1176
01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.160
Dad?

1177
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:02.500
Do you understand that
I can't fucking look at you?


1178
01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:04.430
Leave me alone!

1179
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:16.710
Dad?

1180
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:17.880
Dad!

1181
01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:21.650
Dad!

1182
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:30.060
Dad!

1183
01:22:50.610 --> 01:22:53.910
- Ssh!

1184
01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.780
Goodbye, lucky.

1185
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:05.190
You've got to go now. I can't
look after you anymore.


1186
01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.530
I know you can fly.

1187
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.230
Please! Will you please fly?

1188
01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.370
Come on - go, go!

1189
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.070
You can do it.

1190
01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.340
Come on, please! Please fly.

1191
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:23.140
Learn to fly for me.

1192
01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.140
Fly!

1193
01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:42.900
<i>..Out at the coral sea,</i>

1194
01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:45.300
<i>where it's expected
to completely dissipate</i>


1195
01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:47.200
<i>by around lunchtime tomorrow.</i>

1196
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:49.910
<i>Several coastal suburbs are
feeling the aftermath today,</i>


1197
01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:52.640
<i>with power lines still down
in several areas,</i>


1198
01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:55.240
<i>and 500 homes have been damaged.</i>

1199
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:56.950
<i>It's too soon to tell</i>

1200
01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:59.010
<i>what the cost of the damage
could amount to.</i>


1201
01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:41.680
I'm looking for Hedvig Finch.

1202
01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:43.750
- Are you a relative?
- Yeah, I'm her father.


1203
01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.340
Go to the desk on level 1.

1204
01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:48.340
- Mr and Mrs Finch?
- Yeah.


1205
01:27:48.370 --> 01:27:51.680
Hi, I'm Dr Chandran.
Why don't you have a seat?


1206
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:53.180
How is she?

1207
01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:55.120
She's still
in a critical condition.


1208
01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:57.790
We're doing the best we can,
but it's hard to say now.


1209
01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.290
Is she going to be ok?

1210
01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.050
I don't know. I'm sorry.
We just have to wait...


1211
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:10.970
She can't die.

1212
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.400
- Oliver?
- She can't fucking die!


1213
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:14.900
Oliver.

1214
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:18.840
I told her
I didn't want to look at her!


1215
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:20.980
It doesn't matter.

1216
01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:22.880
What have I done?

1217
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:24.910
What did I do?

1218
01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:28.220
Shh.

1219
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:30.720
- I pushed her away.
- Stop it.


1220
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:32.850
It'll be ok.

1221
01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.490
I'm sorry!

1222
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.130
You have to be strong for her.

1223
01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:41.000
She needs us to be strong
right now.


1224
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:43.730
Ssh. It'll be ok, it'll be ok.

1225
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.870
Everything will be ok.
