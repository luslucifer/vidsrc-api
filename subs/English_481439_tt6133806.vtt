2
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.427
What a week.

3
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.628
My feet hurt.

4
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:33.497
I think we made like 10 times
more cupcakes than usual.


5
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:35.366
That's a good thing.

6
00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.334
Hey what's this?

7
00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.803
- French Vanilla?
- No, lemon blueberry.


8
00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:42.639
- For the competition?
- Yeah.


9
00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:44.818
I can't believe they chose
that Red Velvet cupcake


10
00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:45.976
over yours last year.

11
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.546
I know, and I'm not
letting that happen again


12
00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.716
this year, especially since
they upped the prize to $30,000.


13
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.718
Really? Nice.

14
00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:56.487
So do we get to try
one of these?


15
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.764
Yeah, just a second though,
okay?


16
00:01:57.788 --> 00:02:00.058
Let me take a picture.

17
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:01.126
Okay...

18
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:02.826
one and...

19
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.562
alright, yeah.

20
00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:05.595
Gimme!

21
00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:13.237
Yeah?

22
00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:14.372
Katie?

23
00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.207
It's good, it's really good.

24
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.642
Good?
I need great.


25
00:02:18.676 --> 00:02:20.154
I don't know if it's strong
enough to win.


26
00:02:20.178 --> 00:02:23.314
It's like the frosting is
too sweet or something.


27
00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:24.615
I like it.

28
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.787
I don't know,
I need to think about it.


29
00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:41.499
- Hello!
- Hey Chloe.


30
00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:42.866
How's my favorite sister?

31
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.844
You know you could have called,
I haven't forgotten.


32
00:02:44.868 --> 00:02:45.536
Hey Dylan.

33
00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.606
- Hi, do you have any leftovers?
- Oh yeah sure.


34
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:51.351
Look, are you sure
you haven't forgotten


35
00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:53.382
because ever since
you broke up with Sam...


36
00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.678
I don't want
to talk about it.


37
00:02:54.712 --> 00:02:57.648
You conveniently come up with
reasons to avoid these dates.


38
00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:00.484
- That's because it's a blind date.
- You'll love him.


39
00:03:00.518 --> 00:03:02.486
Oh yeah?
Have you met him?


40
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.256
Yes!
He's Dillon's friend.


41
00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.923
He's cool.

42
00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.625
Yeah, 10 o'clock tomorrow.

43
00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:10.794
Right, at that restaurant
with the horrible lasagna?


44
00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:12.396
Don't be so critical.

45
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.665
It's breakfast, so you
can avoid any pastas.


46
00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:17.635
I just don't understand
why we can't eat here.


47
00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:19.703
Because all you have here
is desserts.


48
00:03:19.737 --> 00:03:20.938
Besides, I know you.

49
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:22.673
You'll end up working,
just like you did


50
00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:24.408
with what's his name.

51
00:03:24.442 --> 00:03:25.276
Honey, what's his name?

52
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:26.210
Mike.

53
00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:29.213
- It was fine.
- It was a fiasco.


54
00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:30.914
We had no chemistry.

55
00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.851
- Tomorrow.
- She'll be there.


56
00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:34.884
Yeah, I will.

57
00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:36.429
Hey Trish,
are you okay if I take off?


58
00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:38.322
Sure yeah, I'll see ya on Monday.

59
00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:40.724
And don't forget to change
your clocks


60
00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:42.493
because it's Daylight Saving's
tonight.


61
00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:44.628
Oh yeah, is it an hour
back or an hour forward?


62
00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:45.996
It's an hour forward.

63
00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.399
Yeah, it's spring forward,
fall back.


64
00:03:48.432 --> 00:03:49.267
Oh yeah, that's right.

65
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.302
- Okay, see ya.
- Bye!


66
00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:56.674
- Hey, what was his name again?
- Adam.


67
00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:58.442
Adam, Adam, Adam.

68
00:03:58.476 --> 00:03:59.786
He'll be wearing a green shirt
and jeans.


69
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.778
Okay.

70
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:02.446
Got it.

71
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.016
- Do you want me to write it down?
- No, green jeans and a shirt.


72
00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.049
Okay.

73
00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:37.967
Oh, what?

74
00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:43.974
Come on.

75
00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:08.865
Okay.

76
00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:27.585
Hi, I'm Trish.

77
00:07:28.886 --> 00:07:30.841
Hi.

78
00:07:31.088 --> 00:07:32.289
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

79
00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:35.959
I worked really late last night
and my alarm didn't go off,


80
00:07:35.993 --> 00:07:39.763
and then my cell phone is fried,
so, technology, huh?


81
00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:44.167
Anyway, I'm just glad
that you're still here.


82
00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:45.669
Me too.

83
00:07:45.703 --> 00:07:48.572
- So, have you ordered?
- Not yet.


84
00:07:48.606 --> 00:07:49.873
What do you usually get?

85
00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:54.812
The omelet.
I always get the omelet.


86
00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:55.845
Okay.

87
00:07:58.215 --> 00:08:01.885
- Are you sure that you're...
- Hi, can I take your order?


88
00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:02.919
Yeah...

89
00:08:04.555 --> 00:08:07.991
I'll take the berry crepe,
please, with some ham inside.


90
00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:10.594
- Ham?
- Yeah, just chopped up a bit.


91
00:08:10.628 --> 00:08:11.662
Sure.

92
00:08:11.695 --> 00:08:12.696
And you sir?

93
00:08:16.934 --> 00:08:18.201
The...

94
00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:20.903
the Southwest Omelet.
Thank you.


95
00:08:24.207 --> 00:08:25.776
What?

96
00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:27.545
Interesting choice.

97
00:08:27.578 --> 00:08:30.981
The ham and, no, I'm sorry,
that's weird, I know.


98
00:08:31.014 --> 00:08:33.651
No, no, it's just that
I've only seen that ordered


99
00:08:33.684 --> 00:08:35.919
by one other person.

100
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.590
I thought I was the only one.

101
00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:41.825
So, tell me about yourself.

102
00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:45.829
What do you want to know?

103
00:08:45.863 --> 00:08:47.898
Well, Chloe says
that you're a lawyer.


104
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:48.931
Chloe?

105
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.803
Did she make that up?
It's so like her.


106
00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:55.305
Well, I...

107
00:08:55.338 --> 00:08:58.008
I deal with the medical side
of things.


108
00:08:58.041 --> 00:09:01.044
Like malpractice,
or an ambulance chaser


109
00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:02.079
kind of thing?

110
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.115
Ambulance chaser is closer.

111
00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:08.586
Adam, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't say that.


112
00:09:08.619 --> 00:09:10.588
I don't mean to offend.

113
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:11.755
Don't worry.

114
00:09:15.993 --> 00:09:17.571
You mentioned you worked late
last night.


115
00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:19.096
- Yeah.
- What do you do?


116
00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:21.904
I own a dessert bakery.
It's called the Cupcake Palace.


117
00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:23.901
- On Fifth.
- Yeah, you know of it?


118
00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:25.969
Right, I pass it a lot,
I just haven't had a chance


119
00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:27.204
to go in yet.

120
00:09:27.237 --> 00:09:30.240
Then you should come in, Adam.

121
00:09:31.609 --> 00:09:34.878
- So, cupcakes, huh?
- Yeah.


122
00:09:34.912 --> 00:09:37.047
They're not just pretty,
they're delicious.


123
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.148
Of course.

124
00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:39.650
- Don't doubt it.
- I won't.


125
00:09:39.683 --> 00:09:43.220
- What about you, do you cook?
- No.


126
00:09:43.253 --> 00:09:45.188
But, I am a great eater.

127
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.227
- What's your favorite flavor?
- Well, like chocolate or vanilla?


128
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.895
Yeah, or dessert or...

129
00:09:51.929 --> 00:09:54.632
Anything chocolate
and peanut butter.


130
00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:56.266
Oh that's a good choice.

131
00:09:56.299 --> 00:10:00.003
You got anything like that
on the bakery's menu?


132
00:10:00.037 --> 00:10:01.037
Maybe.

133
00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:07.277
- You get half.
- Thank you.


134
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.378
Or you get a little more.

135
00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:10.948
She set you up with an IRS agent?

136
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:12.659
Yeah, I don't know
what my sister was thinking.


137
00:10:12.683 --> 00:10:14.818
The guy kept talkin' to me about

138
00:10:14.852 --> 00:10:17.788
how to be a small
business and avoid audits.


139
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:19.757
- It's thoughtful.
- Yeah.


140
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.662
Well, you can see my
hesitation in meeting you then.


141
00:10:24.695 --> 00:10:26.096
I'm glad we met.

142
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.667
Hey there's...

143
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.369
- ...somethin' I should clarify...
- Hey look!


144
00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:34.772
We should do that,
that looks fun.


145
00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:35.805
Come on.

146
00:10:40.944 --> 00:10:44.848
Here ya go, and
watch your step as you get in.


147
00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:51.088
- Have you done this before?
- Yes, you?


148
00:10:51.121 --> 00:10:53.090
When I was a kid.

149
00:10:53.123 --> 00:10:56.193
You don't think that this is
gonna tip over, do you?


150
00:10:56.226 --> 00:11:00.163
- No, only if you rock it.
- No! Don't, don't!


151
00:11:00.197 --> 00:11:01.197
Where to?

152
00:11:02.866 --> 00:11:05.102
I don't know, it doesn't seem
like it's that big.


153
00:11:05.135 --> 00:11:06.303
It's not that deep either.

154
00:11:06.336 --> 00:11:07.738
Aw, don't tell me
you don't swim.


155
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:10.974
I swim, I do, I just,
I'm not a fan of murky water.


156
00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:12.409
Germs?

157
00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:13.944
Monsters?

158
00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:15.312
Monsters, yeah.

159
00:11:16.714 --> 00:11:19.316
That, snakes, and giant catfish.

160
00:11:19.349 --> 00:11:22.831
I don't think there's any
giant catfish in here.


161
00:11:22.919 --> 00:11:25.322
Okay, so it's just snakes
then that I need to be afraid of?


162
00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:27.825
Is that what you're saying,
Adam?


163
00:11:27.858 --> 00:11:29.059
Frogs.

164
00:11:29.092 --> 00:11:32.395
Frogs, they
they hide under lily pads


165
00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:35.265
- and then they jump at you.
- What?


166
00:11:35.298 --> 00:11:37.067
- Yeah.
- Okay.


167
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.369
Alright, well,
if a frog jumps at you,


168
00:11:39.402 --> 00:11:41.171
I'll make sure to scare it off.

169
00:11:41.204 --> 00:11:44.708
As long as you protect me
from giant catfish.


170
00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:45.943
- Deal.
- Good.


171
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:49.288
Can I get some help
paddling this thing?


172
00:11:49.312 --> 00:11:51.181
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.


173
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.368
That was really fun.

174
00:12:45.402 --> 00:12:46.804
Yeah, it was.

175
00:12:48.471 --> 00:12:51.909
It'll be a first, but I'll have
to thank Chloe for that.


176
00:12:51.942 --> 00:12:52.942
Me too.

177
00:12:55.212 --> 00:12:59.316
Okay, well, just so I don't have
to go through my sister...


178
00:13:01.819 --> 00:13:03.753
Yeah, that's my number.

179
00:13:05.222 --> 00:13:06.356
Sounds good.

180
00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:09.827
Thank you, I really...

181
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.328
I had a lovely day.

182
00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:20.470
So, I will see ya later, Adam.

183
00:13:21.538 --> 00:13:27.210
- Goodbye.
- Bye.


184
00:13:33.516 --> 00:13:35.953
Parker.
My name is Parker.


185
00:13:42.092 --> 00:13:43.994
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.


186
00:13:44.027 --> 00:13:46.429
Are those already done?
Am I late?


187
00:13:46.463 --> 00:13:48.231
Don't worry about it, I got it.

188
00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:49.532
Alright, well...

189
00:13:52.169 --> 00:13:53.370
I already added that.

190
00:13:53.403 --> 00:13:55.472
Usually, I put it in last.

191
00:13:55.505 --> 00:13:57.406
- Doesn't make a difference.
- Okay.


192
00:13:58.408 --> 00:14:02.312
And I will get started on
the chocolate croissants.


193
00:14:02.345 --> 00:14:03.480
Those are done.

194
00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:07.284
Yeah, they're cooling.
Relax.


195
00:14:07.317 --> 00:14:08.151
Alright.

196
00:14:08.185 --> 00:14:12.022
- Trish, your sister's here.
- Okay, coming.


197
00:14:15.993 --> 00:14:17.194
How was it?

198
00:14:17.227 --> 00:14:19.329
Don't you have
anything else to do?


199
00:14:19.362 --> 00:14:20.406
Rick's at school,
Dillon's at work.


200
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.399
You should have called me
anyway.


201
00:14:22.432 --> 00:14:23.566
It was nice.

202
00:14:25.335 --> 00:14:29.306
He was likeable.

203
00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:30.107
Finally.

204
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.975
Come on, don't get crazy,
alright?


205
00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:34.011
It was just one date.

206
00:14:34.044 --> 00:14:36.146
I told you he was great.

207
00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:39.649
Alright, you'll have to forgive me
for being skeptical, but...


208
00:14:39.682 --> 00:14:40.682
...yeah, he...

209
00:14:42.319 --> 00:14:43.319
he was.

210
00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:47.290
So?
Is the interest mutual?


211
00:14:47.324 --> 00:14:49.326
I don't know.

212
00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:52.963
And you can not call him
to find out.


213
00:14:52.996 --> 00:14:53.630
Why not?

214
00:14:53.663 --> 00:14:56.366
Because...
this isn't grade school.


215
00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.468
We're adults, alright?
Don't meddle.


216
00:15:00.537 --> 00:15:02.139
Promise me, Chloe.

217
00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:04.173
Fine.

218
00:15:05.642 --> 00:15:06.642
I promise.

219
00:15:11.114 --> 00:15:11.915
Hey honey.

220
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:14.617
- Trish had a great time with Adam.
- Well good.


221
00:15:14.651 --> 00:15:17.354
- Have you heard from him yet?
- No.


222
00:15:17.387 --> 00:15:18.922
Can you call him?

223
00:15:18.956 --> 00:15:21.291
Honey, I don't wanna get
in the middle of their...


224
00:15:21.324 --> 00:15:24.627
Call him so your
sister-in-law can be happy.


225
00:15:24.661 --> 00:15:27.497
You wouldn't deny her a chance
at happiness, would you?


226
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.498
I don't know.

227
00:15:28.531 --> 00:15:30.400
I'll bring you two cupcakes.

228
00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:33.336
- Make it three.
- Done.


229
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.506
I love you.

230
00:15:42.579 --> 00:15:44.647
- Hey Dillon.
- Hey, how's it goin'?


231
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:45.315
Busy.

232
00:15:45.348 --> 00:15:48.085
Yeah, how was your weekend?

233
00:15:48.118 --> 00:15:50.253
I worked most of it, but

234
00:15:50.287 --> 00:15:52.265
I mean, I've got this case
that just keeps burying me


235
00:15:52.289 --> 00:15:53.590
in motion after motion.

236
00:15:53.623 --> 00:15:55.125
Yeah sounds bad.

237
00:15:55.158 --> 00:15:57.727
Hey, how was your date?
Chloe wants to know.


238
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.695
- It could have gone better.
- Really?


239
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.233
- If she had shown up.
- Wait, what?


240
00:16:06.003 --> 00:16:08.471
So, there I am, eating on
my own when she just sits


241
00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:11.574
across from me and starts
talkin' like she knows me, sort of.


242
00:16:11.608 --> 00:16:13.610
- You were eating alone?
- Milo.


243
00:16:13.643 --> 00:16:14.477
Well?

244
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:16.413
- Was she hot?
- Very pretty.


245
00:16:16.446 --> 00:16:18.515
Forget pretty.
Was she crazy?


246
00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:20.126
You know, at first I
wasn't sure, but you know,


247
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.686
she kept talking, and well,
she thought I was someone else.


248
00:16:25.322 --> 00:16:27.133
- What?
- There was something about her.


249
00:16:27.157 --> 00:16:29.759
Something.

250
00:16:29.792 --> 00:16:31.028
I got her number.

251
00:16:31.061 --> 00:16:32.695
- Nice.
- Cool.


252
00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:35.465
And how embarrassed was she
when she finally figured out


253
00:16:35.498 --> 00:16:36.966
who you weren't.

254
00:16:39.402 --> 00:16:41.304
Well, I didn't correct her.

255
00:16:41.338 --> 00:16:44.207
- What?
- This gets better and better.


256
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:46.176
She kept callin' me Adam.

257
00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:47.610
What, is that a middle name now?

258
00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:51.248
Look, I'll tell her, you know?
It's no big deal.


259
00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:56.053
- You stood him up.
- What?


260
00:16:56.086 --> 00:16:59.489
- Adam said you didn't show.
- No, why would he say that?


261
00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:01.858
Be honest Trish.
You did go, didn't you?


262
00:17:01.891 --> 00:17:04.327
I mean, you didn't feed me all
that stuff about liking him


263
00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:06.796
and then not even go
on the date?


264
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:11.168
I met him. We spent
most of the day together.


265
00:17:11.201 --> 00:17:12.035
You did?

266
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.771
Yeah, I don't get why
he would pretend that we didn't meet.


267
00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:20.277
Wait a sec, were you late?

268
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.146
I mean, maybe a little,
but not by much.


269
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.415
Did you set your clock
for Daylight Savings?


270
00:17:25.448 --> 00:17:27.650
No, my phone died, so I...

271
00:17:28.751 --> 00:17:30.220
You were late.

272
00:17:32.622 --> 00:17:36.159
Okay, even if I was late,
I still met a guy there


273
00:17:36.193 --> 00:17:37.760
in a green shirt and jeans.

274
00:17:37.794 --> 00:17:39.462
Was this the guy?

275
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:45.301
No.

276
00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:54.677
You guys don't think
she'll be upset, do you?


277
00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:56.422
Why would she?
You didn't do anything wrong.


278
00:17:56.446 --> 00:17:58.215
No, I mean,
not really.


279
00:17:58.248 --> 00:18:00.183
Why didn't you just explain who
you were?


280
00:18:00.217 --> 00:18:02.285
I don't know, I just...

281
00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:04.787
So what. It's her mistake.
Big deal.


282
00:18:04.821 --> 00:18:06.656
Yeah, but she might not
see things that way.


283
00:18:06.689 --> 00:18:07.690
You think?

284
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:10.659
She'll be fine.
Don't worry.


285
00:18:11.528 --> 00:18:14.697
All units, we have a code 10-45
at Second and Sullivan Avenue.


286
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:18.301
Man in his mid 50s with chest
pains requesting an ambulance.


287
00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:20.337
Unit 10-77 responding.

288
00:18:21.438 --> 00:18:24.407
I mean, what kind of guy
just lies to you the entire time?


289
00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:25.441
I know.

290
00:18:26.309 --> 00:18:28.845
What was he doing?
Laughing at me?


291
00:18:28.878 --> 00:18:32.749
See, yeah, this is why
I don't like dating.


292
00:18:32.782 --> 00:18:35.118
I'm sorry Trish.

293
00:18:35.152 --> 00:18:38.221
You know, Adam is not like this.
Real Adam.


294
00:18:38.255 --> 00:18:40.123
Yeah, I hope so.

295
00:18:40.157 --> 00:18:42.525
Trust my taste better than that.

296
00:18:43.493 --> 00:18:45.328
Was he mad at me?

297
00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:46.696
Yeah, a little.

298
00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:49.532
But, you know,

299
00:18:49.566 --> 00:18:51.701
I'll have Dillon talk to him,
explain the whole thing


300
00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:53.336
and it'll be fine.

301
00:18:55.238 --> 00:18:56.306
I don't know, Chloe.

302
00:18:56.339 --> 00:18:58.775
I really don't wanna be
dealing with this right now.


303
00:18:58.808 --> 00:19:01.611
Technically,
you still owe him a date.


304
00:19:01.644 --> 00:19:02.644
Please?

305
00:19:03.413 --> 00:19:05.815
Stupid Daylight Savings.

306
00:19:10.353 --> 00:19:12.322
Well, you gotta love
those false alarms.


307
00:19:12.355 --> 00:19:13.890
Yeah at least he was alright.

308
00:19:13.923 --> 00:19:17.227
And we got out of the station
for a little while.


309
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.464
Speaking of getting out,
you're dating now?


310
00:19:21.498 --> 00:19:26.169
- I didn't mean to.
- Yeah, but, still.


311
00:19:26.203 --> 00:19:29.372
- Good for you.
- Gee, thanks.


312
00:19:29.406 --> 00:19:31.541
Hey there's her place.

313
00:19:31.574 --> 00:19:33.576
- Who, the girl?
- Yeah, Trish.


314
00:19:34.577 --> 00:19:35.912
You wanna stop?

315
00:19:36.846 --> 00:19:37.846
Sure.

316
00:19:38.515 --> 00:19:41.518
You going as Adam
or as yourself?


317
00:19:46.256 --> 00:19:48.591
I'm starving.
What's good here?


318
00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:50.327
Does it matter?

319
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.894
Guess not.

320
00:19:51.928 --> 00:19:52.928
Thanks.

321
00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:55.832
Hey Trish.

322
00:19:57.434 --> 00:19:58.768
- You.
- Yeah.


323
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.839
So, did you come here
to confess?


324
00:20:02.872 --> 00:20:04.407
Looks like Milo was wrong.

325
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:06.909
- Look, it's not what you think.
- Really?


326
00:20:06.943 --> 00:20:08.311
Is your name Adam?

327
00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:10.647
Well, no,
my name is Parker.


328
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.482
Okay, well then,
it's exactly what I think.


329
00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:14.517
You made me think that
you were somebody else.


330
00:20:14.551 --> 00:20:16.619
No, you assumed
I was this Adam guy.


331
00:20:16.653 --> 00:20:18.721
- But then you kept lying to me.
- I didn't...


332
00:20:18.755 --> 00:20:19.722
People are looking.

333
00:20:19.756 --> 00:20:21.824
I didn't mean to lead you on,
and I'm sorry


334
00:20:21.858 --> 00:20:23.426
you're embarrassed
by the whole mistake.


335
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.563
Embarrassed?
For a mistake?


336
00:20:26.596 --> 00:20:28.641
I didn't know you thought
I was someone else at first.


337
00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:32.969
- But you pretended to be my date.
- But you sat down at my table.


338
00:20:33.002 --> 00:20:35.872
- Because I thought you were Adam.
- Not my fault.


339
00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:38.575
Get out.

340
00:20:38.608 --> 00:20:39.776
Parker, maybe...

341
00:20:39.809 --> 00:20:41.811
Now, now, hang on.
I wanna clear this up.


342
00:20:41.844 --> 00:20:42.445
No, I think I saw a food truck
just around the corner.


343
00:20:42.479 --> 00:20:45.415
I'll order something here.
Lemme see here.


344
00:20:45.448 --> 00:20:48.418
Chocolate croissant, hmm?
Or a Peanut Butter Surprise.


345
00:20:48.451 --> 00:20:50.019
Can't lose there, sure.

346
00:20:50.052 --> 00:20:53.790
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.


347
00:20:56.393 --> 00:20:57.393
Fine.

348
00:20:59.329 --> 00:21:00.797
Nice to meet you.

349
00:21:09.472 --> 00:21:11.608
I've got Adam's number.

350
00:21:11.641 --> 00:21:12.641
What?

351
00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:15.076
I just...

352
00:21:17.414 --> 00:21:19.382
already stood him up once.

353
00:21:19.416 --> 00:21:20.049
Inadvertently.

354
00:21:20.082 --> 00:21:22.385
- True.
- Look, stop stewing


355
00:21:22.419 --> 00:21:25.355
about the imposter
and meet Adam.


356
00:21:25.388 --> 00:21:26.789
He's a great guy.

357
00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:28.858
I just think it's all a little too...

358
00:21:28.891 --> 00:21:31.561
Do not say "too soon"
because it's been over a year


359
00:21:31.594 --> 00:21:32.895
since you broke up with Sam.

360
00:21:32.929 --> 00:21:36.032
Too much.
I was gonna say too much.


361
00:21:36.065 --> 00:21:37.467
It's too much.

362
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.469
I need to be focusing
on the bakery.


363
00:21:39.502 --> 00:21:40.903
Call him, Trish.

364
00:21:41.804 --> 00:21:42.804
Or I will.

365
00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:47.944
Hey, hey, no, no, no, fine.
Fine.


366
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.318
That's good.

367
00:21:55.352 --> 00:21:58.521
- Is that for your bake off?
- It's not a bake off.


368
00:21:58.555 --> 00:22:00.022
Makes it sound so small time.

369
00:22:00.056 --> 00:22:02.925
It's a competition, alright,
and if I win,


370
00:22:02.959 --> 00:22:05.795
that's $30,000
towards a second bakery.


371
00:22:05.828 --> 00:22:07.930
Either way it'll win points
for the Adam.


372
00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:11.934
You know, as a little,
"Sorry I can't figure out


373
00:22:11.968 --> 00:22:14.371
"Daylight Savings" gesture.

374
00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:20.943
So, I wanna apologize
about the other day.


375
00:22:20.977 --> 00:22:21.778
Don't worry about it.

376
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:23.780
How long
were you waiting for me?


377
00:22:23.813 --> 00:22:26.383
Maybe...

378
00:22:26.416 --> 00:22:27.484
45, oh wow.

379
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.953
That's not a good impression.

380
00:22:30.987 --> 00:22:35.124
How 'bout we pretend
the other day didn't happen.


381
00:22:35.157 --> 00:22:37.759
- Okay, I'd like that.
- Good.


382
00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:43.900
So, I was wondering,
do you like plays?


383
00:22:43.933 --> 00:22:44.867
Yeah sure.

384
00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:46.769
I haven't really been
to that many, but...


385
00:22:46.803 --> 00:22:49.372
Well, this is my niece's
performance, so don't set


386
00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:53.009
the bar too high, but,
I thought it'd be fun.


387
00:22:54.444 --> 00:22:56.479
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

388
00:22:56.513 --> 00:22:57.513
Great.

389
00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:11.394
Hey, how was training?

390
00:23:11.428 --> 00:23:12.595
Fine.

391
00:23:12.629 --> 00:23:13.730
What's that?

392
00:23:13.763 --> 00:23:16.198
Nothin'.
I'm off.


393
00:23:16.232 --> 00:23:17.600
Hey, you got big plans tonight?

394
00:23:17.634 --> 00:23:20.603
Yeah, that's what I thought.

395
00:23:20.637 --> 00:23:23.039
Hey my last plans
didn't go so well.


396
00:23:23.072 --> 00:23:26.643
Actually, they went great
based on what you told me.


397
00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:27.810
So?

398
00:23:27.844 --> 00:23:32.415
Well, that's the first blip of life
I've seen in you.


399
00:23:32.449 --> 00:23:34.116
Don't give up so easy.

400
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.792
- So what'd ya think?
- It was good.


401
00:23:42.825 --> 00:23:44.861
Your niece, she was great.

402
00:23:44.894 --> 00:23:46.696
I know it wasn't
as traditional as say,


403
00:23:46.729 --> 00:23:50.867
dinner and a movie, but I figured
you work in a restaurant all day,


404
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.769
you probably want a break.

405
00:23:52.802 --> 00:23:55.872
Actually, I work at a bakery.

406
00:23:55.905 --> 00:23:59.942
So, we serve desserts
and sweets, things like that.


407
00:23:59.976 --> 00:24:01.110
Interesting.

408
00:24:02.178 --> 00:24:05.448
So, not to contradict myself,
but, I'm starved.


409
00:24:05.482 --> 00:24:07.484
- You wanna grab a bite to eat?
- Sure.


410
00:24:07.517 --> 00:24:08.751
What sounds good?

411
00:24:10.587 --> 00:24:11.954
Anything but sushi.

412
00:24:11.988 --> 00:24:14.223
I'm sorry, I gotta take this.

413
00:24:14.256 --> 00:24:15.256
Yeah?

414
00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:18.961
Okay, what'd they come back with?

415
00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:19.996
That's crazy.

416
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:22.665
No, no.
No, there's no deal.


417
00:24:22.699 --> 00:24:24.667
Just tell them no.

418
00:24:24.701 --> 00:24:25.535
Alright...

419
00:24:25.568 --> 00:24:27.537
Yeah, I'll be right in.

420
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.570
Okay.

421
00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:30.940
Sorry.

422
00:24:30.973 --> 00:24:33.442
- Work?
- Legal emergency.


423
00:24:34.544 --> 00:24:35.754
Can we pick this up
some other time?


424
00:24:35.778 --> 00:24:37.647
Oh sure, okay, yeah.

425
00:24:38.915 --> 00:24:41.751
Are you free Saturday?
We can get that sushi.


426
00:24:41.784 --> 00:24:43.085
Yeah.

427
00:25:02.539 --> 00:25:03.606
You again.

428
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.640
Me...

429
00:25:05.642 --> 00:25:06.743
Parker.

430
00:25:06.776 --> 00:25:07.610
I know.

431
00:25:07.644 --> 00:25:10.713
I just wanna be up front
this time.


432
00:25:11.848 --> 00:25:15.518
- So, why are you here?
- To see you.


433
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.888
Workin' late?

434
00:25:20.222 --> 00:25:23.125
Yeah, I was just tryin'
to catch up on some work


435
00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:27.029
'cause I
had gone on this date, so.


436
00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:34.236
Okay, okay, I just,
I wanna explain everything.


437
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.838
About why you lied?

438
00:25:35.872 --> 00:25:38.708
Technically,
I just didn't correct you.


439
00:25:38.741 --> 00:25:39.676
Why not?

440
00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:41.911
Actually, I tried, but
it never panned out.


441
00:25:41.944 --> 00:25:43.613
At first, I was so surprised,
I mean,


442
00:25:43.646 --> 00:25:45.648
you just sat down and
started talkin' to me.


443
00:25:45.682 --> 00:25:47.750
Yeah, but why didn't
you just tell me later?


444
00:25:47.784 --> 00:25:49.151
We talked for hours.

445
00:25:49.185 --> 00:25:51.025
You should have told me
the minute you realized


446
00:25:51.053 --> 00:25:52.021
what had happened.

447
00:25:52.054 --> 00:25:54.056
Well, I know that now,
it's just, I don't know.


448
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:54.724
I didn't wanna spoil it.

449
00:25:54.757 --> 00:25:57.159
Because there was something...

450
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.264
...different about you.

451
00:26:03.866 --> 00:26:05.935
That's actually really...

452
00:26:06.836 --> 00:26:08.070
...that's really sweet.

453
00:26:10.673 --> 00:26:15.745
But, then I realize, that I really,
I don't have a reason to trust you.


454
00:26:15.778 --> 00:26:17.313
I'm sorry, is there any way...

455
00:26:17.346 --> 00:26:20.082
No, you know,
I'm just really busy lately.


456
00:26:20.116 --> 00:26:22.785
I've got a lot going on and...

457
00:26:23.886 --> 00:26:25.731
really the only reason we met
was because of the whole


458
00:26:25.755 --> 00:26:27.356
time change thing.

459
00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:31.093
So, it's probably better
if you just, you know,


460
00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:34.096
go and try to forget about me.

461
00:26:40.703 --> 00:26:41.703
Okay.

462
00:26:51.413 --> 00:26:54.383
I can not believe
Parker came over again.


463
00:26:54.416 --> 00:26:56.986
- That was gutsy, huh?
- Yeah.


464
00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:59.989
Anyway, how was your date
with Adam?


465
00:27:05.227 --> 00:27:06.227
Hello?

466
00:27:07.163 --> 00:27:10.132
Yeah, it was,
it was nice.


467
00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:11.067
It was fine.

468
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.670
He's super charming, isn't he?

469
00:27:15.337 --> 00:27:17.974
Yeah,
yeah, he's a real gentleman.


470
00:27:18.007 --> 00:27:19.809
So, what'd you do?

471
00:27:19.842 --> 00:27:22.745
We went to his niece's play.

472
00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:27.717
- Like, at an elementary school?
- No, it was a theater of sorts.


473
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.719
It was fine,
it was fine.


474
00:27:29.752 --> 00:27:30.419
Great.

475
00:27:30.452 --> 00:27:32.955
Really kinda sweet, actually.

476
00:27:34.724 --> 00:27:36.158
Yeah...

477
00:27:36.192 --> 00:27:37.192
...yeah.

478
00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:39.996
So?

479
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:43.232
So, we have another date
on Saturday.


480
00:27:47.169 --> 00:27:49.138
She is so aggravating.

481
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:51.874
No matter what I say she still thinks
I'm one of those guys.


482
00:27:51.908 --> 00:27:53.042
What guys?

483
00:27:53.075 --> 00:27:55.311
You know, guys like,
you know, like Milo.


484
00:27:55.344 --> 00:27:56.846
Hey!

485
00:27:56.879 --> 00:27:58.280
Well, you know what I mean.

486
00:27:58.314 --> 00:28:00.182
Thanks.

487
00:28:00.216 --> 00:28:02.018
- What's wrong with me?
- No, nothin'.


488
00:28:02.051 --> 00:28:05.888
It's just a
predatory vibe you give off.


489
00:28:05.922 --> 00:28:09.191
Persistent. I prefer persistent,
for the record.


490
00:28:09.225 --> 00:28:12.261
Actually, maybe you
should be more like him.


491
00:28:12.294 --> 00:28:13.195
What?

492
00:28:13.229 --> 00:28:15.932
No, I don't mean
mindlessly go after her.


493
00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:18.367
But, don't give up either.

494
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.869
He's right.

495
00:28:19.902 --> 00:28:22.404
Mindlessly wasn't necessary,
though.


496
00:28:22.438 --> 00:28:25.341
Really just depends on
if you think she's worth it or not.


497
00:28:25.374 --> 00:28:28.210
I mean, after all, you're the one
that had the fantastic date with her


498
00:28:28.244 --> 00:28:31.848
that breathed rhythm back
into your heart.


499
00:28:31.881 --> 00:28:33.826
- That's...
- That's not bad at all, is it?


500
00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.451
That's pretty good.

501
00:28:38.054 --> 00:28:39.789
What's with the flowers?

502
00:28:39.822 --> 00:28:40.790
I don't know.

503
00:28:40.823 --> 00:28:42.825
They were on the front doorstep
when I got in.


504
00:28:42.859 --> 00:28:44.794
What's it say?

505
00:28:44.827 --> 00:28:46.462
"Roses are red,
violets are blue,


506
00:28:46.495 --> 00:28:49.365
"if you give me a chance,
I'll give you one too."


507
00:28:50.767 --> 00:28:52.902
- Well, that's kind of...
- Lame?


508
00:28:52.935 --> 00:28:55.071
No, I was gonna say cute.

509
00:28:55.104 --> 00:28:56.238
Who's it from?

510
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.141
No one.

511
00:28:59.175 --> 00:29:00.175
No.

512
00:29:05.882 --> 00:29:09.313
So, barring complications,
I'll be made Senior Partner this year.


513
00:29:09.337 --> 00:29:11.287
That's awesome.

514
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.355
Have you always
wanted to be a lawyer?


515
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:14.389
I think so.

516
00:29:15.424 --> 00:29:19.762
I mean, everything in college
was about getting into law school.


517
00:29:19.796 --> 00:29:22.865
And after that, I joined a firm
and haven't stopped.


518
00:29:24.867 --> 00:29:27.736
What about you?
Always a chef?


519
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.874
Actually, no,
I was an accountant.


520
00:29:31.908 --> 00:29:34.009
- No.
- Yeah.


521
00:29:35.511 --> 00:29:37.847
I didn't think you were that...

522
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.282
- Business savvy?
- Organized.


523
00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:44.086
Not because of the whole
big late to our date thing.


524
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.788
Yeah, sure, sure.

525
00:29:46.588 --> 00:29:48.825
Baking was always something
that kept me interested,


526
00:29:48.858 --> 00:29:49.892
you know, growing up.

527
00:29:49.926 --> 00:29:51.436
I loved pushing all the buttons
on the appliances,


528
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.363
and my mom, she would always
let me stir the batter.


529
00:29:54.396 --> 00:29:56.799
How's your sushi?

530
00:29:56.833 --> 00:29:59.501
It's,
not my favorite.


531
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:03.372
- Well, it's just...
- I thought it was pretty fresh.


532
00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:04.974
- Here, try mine.
- No, that's okay.


533
00:30:05.007 --> 00:30:06.318
- Just try a little bite.
- Really, I'm really okay.


534
00:30:06.342 --> 00:30:07.670
- Just try a little bite.
- You should probably...


535
00:30:07.694 --> 00:30:10.012
I'm full, I'm good.

536
00:30:10.046 --> 00:30:11.080
Thank you.

537
00:30:11.113 --> 00:30:15.584
Sorry, you were saying something
about your cooking hobby.


538
00:30:15.617 --> 00:30:16.685
Right, right.

539
00:30:16.718 --> 00:30:20.857
I don't think I ever considered
baking as a career.


540
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.334
But you know, every tax season
when things would get


541
00:30:22.358 --> 00:30:25.361
especially stressful, I would
make myself take a break


542
00:30:25.394 --> 00:30:27.396
and I would start baking
all these new things,


543
00:30:27.429 --> 00:30:30.399
and that's when I realized I
just liked it so much better


544
00:30:30.432 --> 00:30:31.567
than crunching numbers.

545
00:30:32.468 --> 00:30:33.402
Who wouldn't?

546
00:30:33.435 --> 00:30:36.939
Excuse me, can we get
another unagi roll?


547
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:40.641
Yay.

548
00:30:42.078 --> 00:30:43.078
Flowers?

549
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.014
What?

550
00:30:45.047 --> 00:30:46.949
Well, it's not enough.

551
00:30:46.983 --> 00:30:48.250
How do you know?

552
00:30:48.284 --> 00:30:51.487
- Did she call?
- It's classic.


553
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.555
Look, maybe it's enough
if she already likes you,


554
00:30:53.589 --> 00:30:55.591
but that's not the case.

555
00:30:56.558 --> 00:30:57.927
Thanks.

556
00:30:58.928 --> 00:31:00.338
I'm just sayin' man,
you gotta be charming.


557
00:31:00.362 --> 00:31:01.297
I am!

558
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.000
I know you are, so,
make her smile, laugh.


559
00:31:06.035 --> 00:31:08.070
Then, she can't stay mad at you.

560
00:31:08.104 --> 00:31:09.184
You missed a spot up there.

561
00:31:09.939 --> 00:31:13.575
All units,
we have a code 242...


562
00:31:22.018 --> 00:31:24.494
He just got this look on his face
and then he, he just fell.


563
00:31:24.585 --> 00:31:26.664
- How long ago did he fall?
- I don't know. 10 minutes?


564
00:31:26.688 --> 00:31:28.490
Hey buddy, can you hear me?

565
00:31:28.524 --> 00:31:29.191
Pulse?

566
00:31:29.225 --> 00:31:31.928
Pulse is gone, 
I'm starting CPR.

567
00:31:31.961 --> 00:31:33.429
He's not breathing.

568
00:31:34.964 --> 00:31:39.468
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,


569
00:31:39.501 --> 00:31:41.470
nine, 10, 11, 12,

570
00:31:41.503 --> 00:31:45.683
13, 14, 15, 16,

571
00:31:49.278 --> 00:31:52.982
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,


572
00:31:53.015 --> 00:31:57.153
nine, 10, 11, 12,

573
00:31:57.186 --> 00:32:00.556
17, 18, 19, 20,

574
00:32:10.132 --> 00:32:12.133
- You okay?
- Fine.


575
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:15.247
Look, there was nothin' we
could do here, you know?


576
00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:16.271
I know.

577
00:32:17.206 --> 00:32:18.550
I'm just sayin', you don't
wanna internalize it.


578
00:32:18.574 --> 00:32:19.675
It'll eat you up.

579
00:32:19.708 --> 00:32:21.477
We should go.

580
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.378
- Parker.
- I'm fine.


581
00:32:38.127 --> 00:32:39.996
- What took you so long?
- Sorry.


582
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:41.297
I was...

583
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.198
What's that?

584
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:45.634
I have no idea.
It was outside the door.


585
00:32:45.667 --> 00:32:47.569
What are you up to?

586
00:32:47.603 --> 00:32:49.171
Just cost analysis.

587
00:32:49.205 --> 00:32:51.373
You'd think that two stores
would be more efficient


588
00:32:51.407 --> 00:32:52.941
than one, but no.

589
00:32:53.742 --> 00:32:55.477
Oh, my word.

590
00:32:55.511 --> 00:32:58.214
Have you been binging?

591
00:32:58.247 --> 00:32:59.048
No, those are left overs

592
00:32:59.081 --> 00:33:01.383
from the cupcake competition
samples.


593
00:33:01.417 --> 00:33:04.620
- I was working on 'em all day.
- Of course.


594
00:33:04.653 --> 00:33:07.056
So, when you win the prize money,
is it gonna be enough


595
00:33:07.089 --> 00:33:08.190
for a second store?

596
00:33:08.224 --> 00:33:10.426
If I win, and no, it's not.

597
00:33:10.459 --> 00:33:12.161
But it'll be enough
to get me started.


598
00:33:14.396 --> 00:33:15.464
What is that?

599
00:33:16.398 --> 00:33:20.302
"Sorry our signals got mixed up,
Parker".


600
00:33:20.336 --> 00:33:22.038
Don't you already have
one of those?


601
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:23.071
Yeah.

602
00:33:24.106 --> 00:33:26.242
"Please don't toss me out.

603
00:33:27.809 --> 00:33:29.678
"See ya soon, Parker."

604
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.683
Okay, I guess we have
to give him points for creativity


605
00:33:34.716 --> 00:33:35.717
on that one.

606
00:33:38.387 --> 00:33:40.322
This one's my favorite.

607
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.035
That one is the customer favorite.

608
00:33:53.069 --> 00:33:54.070
- Hi.
- Hey.


609
00:33:55.337 --> 00:33:57.106
How are you?
You got the gifts?


610
00:33:57.139 --> 00:33:58.574
Yes.

611
00:33:59.475 --> 00:34:01.343
- Good.
- Yes.


612
00:34:01.377 --> 00:34:03.512
So, can I get you anything?

613
00:34:03.545 --> 00:34:04.545
Look...

614
00:34:06.148 --> 00:34:09.285
our short but turbulent history aside,

615
00:34:10.852 --> 00:34:13.389
how about we go out, you know?

616
00:34:13.422 --> 00:34:16.292
- Start over?
- So I don't toss you out?


617
00:34:17.193 --> 00:34:18.193
Yeah.

618
00:34:19.428 --> 00:34:21.797
I'm Parker.
I'm a paramedic.


619
00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.466
Not an ambulance chaser?

620
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.237
No, I'm inside the ambulance,
so what do ya say?


621
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.172
You know...

622
00:34:30.206 --> 00:34:32.808
I really do appreciate
the gifts.


623
00:34:34.276 --> 00:34:36.777
- But...
- But?


624
00:34:38.147 --> 00:34:40.416
But, I'm kinda seein'
somebody else right now.


625
00:34:43.185 --> 00:34:44.185
Adam?

626
00:34:44.853 --> 00:34:47.256
Yes, yes, the real one.

627
00:34:51.193 --> 00:34:52.664
Well, then, we'll go as friends.

628
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.431
Come on!

629
00:34:55.464 --> 00:34:57.409
I mean, after a long day of baking,
you need a break, so...


630
00:34:57.433 --> 00:35:01.437
how about...
ice cream?


631
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.504
Ice cream?

632
00:35:02.538 --> 00:35:04.673
Well I figure it's safe
because you don't sell it.


633
00:35:04.706 --> 00:35:08.244
So, you're probably not tired of it,
but you pick.


634
00:35:08.277 --> 00:35:10.379
Well, you know,

635
00:35:10.412 --> 00:35:11.423
I'm supposed to close up
tonight.


636
00:35:11.447 --> 00:35:14.783
We have a huge batch that's
due in the morning, and I...


637
00:35:14.816 --> 00:35:17.219
No, I got this.
You go.


638
00:35:17.253 --> 00:35:18.587
She's got this.

639
00:35:19.788 --> 00:35:20.622
Okay...

640
00:35:20.656 --> 00:35:22.591
- ...alright.
- Yes.


641
00:35:23.825 --> 00:35:27.263
Alright, call me if you need
anything.


642
00:35:28.264 --> 00:35:31.233
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


643
00:35:31.267 --> 00:35:32.401
So, real Adam.

644
00:35:34.803 --> 00:35:36.272
What about him?

645
00:35:36.305 --> 00:35:39.175
Well, as your friend,
I'm curious about 'em.


646
00:35:40.442 --> 00:35:42.578
What's he like?

647
00:35:42.611 --> 00:35:44.346
- He's tall.
- Okay.


648
00:35:45.647 --> 00:35:49.351
- He has trendy hair.
- Yes!


649
00:35:49.385 --> 00:35:50.386
He's nice.

650
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:55.624
Some spark between you two.

651
00:35:55.657 --> 00:35:57.459
And what about you, huh?

652
00:35:57.493 --> 00:35:59.561
You been goin' out much?

653
00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:00.862
Not really.

654
00:36:00.896 --> 00:36:02.198
Why not?

655
00:36:02.231 --> 00:36:03.832
Work keeps me busy.

656
00:36:04.833 --> 00:36:06.235
Yeah, me too.

657
00:36:07.669 --> 00:36:09.638
My sister seems to think
because she has to,


658
00:36:09.671 --> 00:36:11.907
you know, juggle a household
with kids and husband


659
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.212
and everything, that all of us
must just have so much time.


660
00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:18.380
Why does she care so much?

661
00:36:18.414 --> 00:36:20.416
I think maybe because
she's family.


662
00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:22.684
She feels responsible.

663
00:36:22.718 --> 00:36:24.486
Older sister?

664
00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.954
Yeah.

665
00:36:25.987 --> 00:36:28.590
My parents actually died
when I was younger,


666
00:36:28.624 --> 00:36:31.393
so she likes to claim
that she raised me.


667
00:36:31.427 --> 00:36:33.762
Well, it's nice to have someone
who cares.


668
00:36:33.795 --> 00:36:34.795
Yeah.

669
00:36:35.664 --> 00:36:40.236
So, other than cooking,
what do you like to do?


670
00:36:40.269 --> 00:36:41.970
- Bake more.
- Oh come on.


671
00:36:42.003 --> 00:36:43.439
Yeah, I do.

672
00:36:43.472 --> 00:36:45.983
I have this competition coming up
and that's what I've been workin' on.


673
00:36:46.007 --> 00:36:48.476
- A baking competition?
- Yeah.


674
00:36:49.478 --> 00:36:51.580
It's a pretty big deal.

675
00:36:51.613 --> 00:36:53.782
Yeah, but you don't bake all day.
So, what do you do?


676
00:36:53.815 --> 00:36:57.419
Do you like to read,
build stuff, any hobbies?


677
00:36:58.554 --> 00:37:01.289
Read, sure, yeah.

678
00:37:02.458 --> 00:37:05.627
But, I'm tellin' ya, I really,
I just don't have any time.


679
00:37:05.661 --> 00:37:07.496
Okay, okay, put it this way.

680
00:37:07.529 --> 00:37:10.466
If you had time,
what would you do?


681
00:37:13.435 --> 00:37:14.536
Paint.

682
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.738
What, like brushes and canvas?

683
00:37:16.772 --> 00:37:18.474
No, finger paint.

684
00:37:18.507 --> 00:37:21.677
Yes, brushes and canvas.

685
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:22.978
Why don't you?

686
00:37:24.413 --> 00:37:27.916
I honestly,
I just don't have time.


687
00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:32.288
You know, we find the time
for things that are important.


688
00:37:33.054 --> 00:37:34.556
What about you?

689
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.858
Do you eat, sleep, and
breathe being a paramedic?


690
00:37:36.892 --> 00:37:37.593
No.

691
00:37:37.626 --> 00:37:40.629
No, I hear that leads
to burnout.


692
00:37:40.662 --> 00:37:42.831
Alright, so then,
what do you do for fun?


693
00:37:42.864 --> 00:37:43.864
Well, I...

694
00:37:46.335 --> 00:37:49.605
go out with women
who are late to blind dates.


695
00:37:52.007 --> 00:37:54.509
- That's wrong.
- Brain freeze.


696
00:37:57.879 --> 00:37:59.781
So, how long have you been
a paramedic?


697
00:37:59.815 --> 00:38:01.850
- About a year.
- A year?


698
00:38:03.084 --> 00:38:04.386
And what did you do
before that?


699
00:38:05.287 --> 00:38:08.290
You know,
a little of this and that.


700
00:38:08.324 --> 00:38:11.993
What made you wanna become
a paramedic?


701
00:38:12.027 --> 00:38:14.730
You know, I wanted to be able
to honk at people


702
00:38:14.763 --> 00:38:16.498
and run red lights legitimately.

703
00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:20.836
Well, thank you
for the milk shake.


704
00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:22.003
My pleasure.

705
00:38:23.705 --> 00:38:27.443
- Hey Trish!
- Oh hi, Adam, hi.


706
00:38:27.476 --> 00:38:30.979
I had a major break through
in one of my cases.


707
00:38:31.012 --> 00:38:33.582
- Thought we should celebrate.
- Congratulations.


708
00:38:33.615 --> 00:38:36.552
This is...
this is Parker.


709
00:38:36.585 --> 00:38:37.853
Just a friend.

710
00:38:37.886 --> 00:38:40.389
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, yes it is.


711
00:38:40.422 --> 00:38:41.422
So...

712
00:38:42.624 --> 00:38:44.826
Yeah, you know,
I'll see you later.


713
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.860
Okay.

714
00:38:47.028 --> 00:38:48.597
He's not that tall.

715
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.499
Nice to meet you Adam.

716
00:38:53.835 --> 00:38:54.903
What are you doin'?

717
00:38:54.936 --> 00:38:55.936
What?

718
00:38:56.772 --> 00:38:58.707
You're setting yourself up
for heartbreak.


719
00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.942
Well, it's not like I want it
that way.


720
00:39:00.976 --> 00:39:02.811
Weren't you tellin' me
to go after her?


721
00:39:02.844 --> 00:39:05.581
Well, yeah, but not
if you're the one gettin' hurt.


722
00:39:05.614 --> 00:39:07.492
And here I thought you'd say,
"Put yourself out there.


723
00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:10.318
"Nothing risked, nothing gained."

724
00:39:11.019 --> 00:39:13.054
What is the big deal, right?

725
00:39:13.088 --> 00:39:15.391
If it doesn't work out,
you move on.


726
00:39:15.424 --> 00:39:19.027
This girl I'm datin' right now,
her cousin is smokin' hot.


727
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.496
Thanks, but no.

728
00:39:20.529 --> 00:39:22.498
No, no, Milo's got
the right idea, sort of.


729
00:39:22.531 --> 00:39:25.801
Maybe you should focus on dating
someone who's available.


730
00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:27.479
You guys are makin' this harder
than it needs to be.


731
00:39:27.503 --> 00:39:29.670
Just shoot the ball.
Come on.


732
00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:32.107
Fine, make a shot.

733
00:39:35.176 --> 00:39:38.013
It's crazy out there.
We're almost out of eclairs.


734
00:39:38.046 --> 00:39:40.682
A guy came in and bought
a whole bunch for his office.


735
00:39:40.716 --> 00:39:43.619
- What?
- What?


736
00:39:43.652 --> 00:39:45.821
This is supposed to have scallops
on the side.


737
00:39:45.854 --> 00:39:47.122
It looks fine.

738
00:39:48.023 --> 00:39:49.658
- This is for sale.
- Just one slice.


739
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:51.493
You're literally eating
my profits.


740
00:39:53.094 --> 00:39:56.031
Okay, I've got that meeting
with the bank.


741
00:39:56.064 --> 00:39:58.967
- What for?
- For the second store.


742
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.069
You know, I can handle it here.
You should just go.


743
00:40:01.102 --> 00:40:03.839
No, you know what,
I think I'm just gonna reschedule.


744
00:40:04.806 --> 00:40:08.143
You know what, I'll get that.
Thank you.


745
00:40:12.648 --> 00:40:15.584
- What?
- What what?


746
00:40:15.617 --> 00:40:17.519
The oven's not working.

747
00:40:17.553 --> 00:40:19.521
It was working all morning.

748
00:40:19.555 --> 00:40:20.989
Those are definitely half baked.

749
00:40:21.022 --> 00:40:22.022
I know.

750
00:40:23.058 --> 00:40:24.092
What are we gonna do?

751
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:25.837
There's already not very much
on the display cases.


752
00:40:25.861 --> 00:40:27.696
I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know.


753
00:40:27.729 --> 00:40:30.599
- Do you want me to help?
- Can you fix an oven?


754
00:40:30.632 --> 00:40:31.632
No.

755
00:40:33.935 --> 00:40:36.004
Hi, this is Trish
from the Cupcake Palace.


756
00:40:36.037 --> 00:40:38.974
Yeah, hey, listen,
my oven just stopped working.


757
00:40:39.007 --> 00:40:40.518
I was wondering
if you could send somebody by


758
00:40:40.542 --> 00:40:41.910
to come and look at it.

759
00:40:41.943 --> 00:40:44.480
No, I can't wait
until tomorrow.


760
00:40:44.513 --> 00:40:47.015
I'm a bakery
and I need my oven.


761
00:40:48.817 --> 00:40:52.087
Okay, look,
listen, if anyone cancels,


762
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.023
can you just give me a call,
please?


763
00:40:55.056 --> 00:40:56.091
Thank you.

764
00:40:56.124 --> 00:40:57.092
You need to call
another company.


765
00:40:57.125 --> 00:40:58.627
Here's another one.

766
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.462
Perfect, thank you.

767
00:41:01.129 --> 00:41:02.698
Hi, this is Trish from the...

768
00:41:03.899 --> 00:41:04.900
I'm on hold.

769
00:41:07.235 --> 00:41:10.205
Dave, I need the deposition
transcripts from Tuesday.


770
00:41:10.238 --> 00:41:11.907
I'm on it.

771
00:41:15.544 --> 00:41:17.546
Trish, how are you?

772
00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:18.780
I'm okay.

773
00:41:18.814 --> 00:41:20.816
Listen, do you have a moment?

774
00:41:20.849 --> 00:41:22.684
Yeah, if it's quick.

775
00:41:22.718 --> 00:41:26.655
Okay, my oven just broke down
and I've been on the phone


776
00:41:26.688 --> 00:41:29.791
looking for repairmen everywhere,
and well, I can't find anybody,


777
00:41:29.825 --> 00:41:32.694
so do you know of anybody handy
or do you think


778
00:41:32.728 --> 00:41:34.029
you might be able to look at it?

779
00:41:34.062 --> 00:41:37.198
Yeah, I could probably
stop by later tonight.


780
00:41:37.232 --> 00:41:38.867
Oh wait...

781
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.137
Trish, I gotta go.
I'll call ya later, okay?


782
00:41:43.038 --> 00:41:45.541
Okay.
Bye, bye.


783
00:41:45.574 --> 00:41:46.341
Any luck?

784
00:41:46.374 --> 00:41:47.876
No, we're gonna have
to improvise.


785
00:41:47.909 --> 00:41:48.986
You know what,
why don't you just take those


786
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.179
on up to my apartment,
'cause the oven works there.


787
00:41:51.212 --> 00:41:52.614
They won't all fit.

788
00:41:52.648 --> 00:41:55.584
I know, but just do
what you can.


789
00:42:01.923 --> 00:42:04.560
Hi...
this is Trish.


790
00:42:04.593 --> 00:42:05.994
Hey, are you busy?

791
00:42:10.832 --> 00:42:11.974
So, that's fake Adam.

792
00:42:14.002 --> 00:42:15.136
So what happened?

793
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:16.337
I don't know.

794
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:18.640
It just stopped working
right in the middle of a batch.


795
00:42:18.674 --> 00:42:20.008
Has it had problems lately?

796
00:42:20.041 --> 00:42:22.544
No, this is totally
out of the blue.


797
00:42:22.578 --> 00:42:25.313
- Is it still under warranty?
- 'Course not.


798
00:42:25.346 --> 00:42:28.249
- Where are your circuit breakers?
- This way.


799
00:42:31.687 --> 00:42:33.154
Right, let's see.

800
00:42:36.692 --> 00:42:39.828
Alright, let's see
if I reset it, if that will work.


801
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.999
- Did that fix it?
- I don't know.


802
00:42:49.638 --> 00:42:52.608
- It's still not heatin' up.
- The fan's working.


803
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:54.976
- It's a gas oven, right?
- Yeah.


804
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.878
Alright, lemme check
the pilot light.


805
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.215
Nope, not down here.

806
00:43:07.823 --> 00:43:09.357
Alright, it's plugged in.

807
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:11.126
Main gas line is on.

808
00:43:12.761 --> 00:43:14.696
Here's the pilot.

809
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:15.797
But it's off.

810
00:43:18.033 --> 00:43:20.802
- It could be the flame sensor.
- What?


811
00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:23.138
Well, if it's dirty
or there's a blockage,


812
00:43:23.171 --> 00:43:24.640
it prevents the flow of gas.

813
00:43:24.673 --> 00:43:26.808
Do you have something
to clean it off with?


814
00:43:32.347 --> 00:43:33.749
How about this?

815
00:43:35.383 --> 00:43:37.218
Yeah, maybe something
a little bit bigger.


816
00:43:37.252 --> 00:43:38.887
Like a rough sponge?

817
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.756
It's a big sensor.
Alright.


818
00:43:42.658 --> 00:43:45.160
It's like a cotton swab.

819
00:43:47.863 --> 00:43:49.364
This?
Will that work?


820
00:43:49.397 --> 00:43:51.265
That should work.
Let's see.


821
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.202
Alright, turn it off.

822
00:43:55.737 --> 00:43:59.775
- Okay, it's off.
- Okay.


823
00:43:59.808 --> 00:44:04.079
Let's see if this is gonna work.
That should do it.


824
00:44:04.112 --> 00:44:05.112
Try that.

825
00:44:05.947 --> 00:44:07.916
Okay.

826
00:44:10.986 --> 00:44:11.986
It works!

827
00:44:12.821 --> 00:44:14.289
You fixed it.

828
00:44:14.322 --> 00:44:16.257
Yeah, I'd still
get it checked out.


829
00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:17.291
Yeah...

830
00:44:18.093 --> 00:44:19.327
I'm impressed.

831
00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.963
Hey Katie, it's back on!

832
00:44:21.997 --> 00:44:23.999
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


833
00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:28.269
- Thank you so much.
- It was no trouble.


834
00:44:28.303 --> 00:44:30.706
I feel bad bugging you
on your day off.


835
00:44:30.739 --> 00:44:32.240
Well, you can make it up to me.

836
00:44:32.273 --> 00:44:34.442
Let me take you out.

837
00:44:34.475 --> 00:44:38.113
There's something going on
tomorrow I think you'd really like.


838
00:44:38.146 --> 00:44:39.414
Don't mind me.

839
00:44:41.416 --> 00:44:43.051
- Parker.
- Come on.


840
00:44:43.084 --> 00:44:45.420
As a token of your gratitude.

841
00:44:48.089 --> 00:44:49.089
Okay.

842
00:45:00.936 --> 00:45:03.939
I thought this could be a chance
to try your potential hobby.


843
00:45:05.006 --> 00:45:08.276
Well, I really don't know
how to paint though.


844
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:11.246
It's a class.
We'll be in good company.


845
00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:14.182
Alright everyone,
take your places.


846
00:45:14.215 --> 00:45:16.684
Does everyone have a canvas?

847
00:45:25.894 --> 00:45:29.197
- You're really good at this.
- I'm not so sure.


848
00:45:30.298 --> 00:45:32.333
How about yours?
How's yours coming?


849
00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:34.402
It's perfect, I know.

850
00:45:38.539 --> 00:45:41.409
It's the shading.
That's the tricky part, right?


851
00:45:41.442 --> 00:45:46.181
- I feel like it's just so flat.
- Well, it is your first painting.


852
00:45:46.214 --> 00:45:48.083
You'll be a pro in no time.

853
00:45:48.116 --> 00:45:50.185
I don't think I have time
for more.


854
00:45:50.218 --> 00:45:52.353
You'll find it.

855
00:45:52.387 --> 00:45:55.290
How do you do it?
How do you make time?


856
00:45:55.323 --> 00:45:57.759
When I have a day off,
I use it.


857
00:45:57.793 --> 00:45:58.760
Really?

858
00:45:58.794 --> 00:46:01.997
When I'm not at work, I feel like
that's all that I think about.


859
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:03.074
Yeah, but don't you have
great people


860
00:46:03.098 --> 00:46:05.133
who can handle things there?

861
00:46:05.166 --> 00:46:06.501
Yeah, I'm just always worried

862
00:46:06.534 --> 00:46:08.536
that if I'm gone for too long,
there's gonna be


863
00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:10.939
some massive crisis
and I'll be the only one


864
00:46:10.972 --> 00:46:12.207
that could fix it.

865
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.543
You need a little bit of faith,
don't you think?


866
00:46:15.576 --> 00:46:18.313
Don't you get scared?

867
00:46:18.346 --> 00:46:21.116
I mean, scared that maybe
you could be the one


868
00:46:21.149 --> 00:46:24.119
that could save someone
if you were on duty?


869
00:46:24.152 --> 00:46:26.087
I'm just as scared
when I'm on duty.


870
00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:27.789
Really?

871
00:46:27.823 --> 00:46:31.526
I guess I feel like if I'm there,
I'll have some kind of control.


872
00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:34.796
I'm never in control,
but I do what I can.


873
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.999
So, what do you do if you feel
like that there's


874
00:46:38.033 --> 00:46:40.268
someone you can't help?

875
00:46:40.301 --> 00:46:43.504
Well, my training says
to stay calm, try whatever I can


876
00:46:43.538 --> 00:46:45.440
and make a difference anyway.

877
00:46:45.473 --> 00:46:46.473
But...

878
00:46:50.278 --> 00:46:51.278
But what?

879
00:46:52.613 --> 00:46:56.852
Really, what I try to do
is not think about it.


880
00:46:58.153 --> 00:46:59.354
Does that work?

881
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.425
Not yet, but I keep tryin'.

882
00:47:06.627 --> 00:47:11.166
So, why do you keep trying
if it bothers you so much?


883
00:47:11.199 --> 00:47:13.234
Which I understand
that it could.


884
00:47:13.268 --> 00:47:15.436
Because of all the times
me being there


885
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.405
did change the outcome.

886
00:47:28.984 --> 00:47:30.427
So you said the other night
that you haven't been


887
00:47:30.451 --> 00:47:32.053
a paramedic for long, right?

888
00:47:32.087 --> 00:47:34.222
- Yes.
- What'd you do before that?


889
00:47:34.255 --> 00:47:36.424
- Before?
- Yeah.


890
00:47:36.457 --> 00:47:38.226
You know, nothing...

891
00:47:38.259 --> 00:47:39.861
important.

892
00:47:39.895 --> 00:47:43.064
Well, you had to have
switched careers, right?


893
00:47:43.098 --> 00:47:45.967
- Yeah, but...
- What was it?


894
00:47:46.001 --> 00:47:47.444
Like an early midlife crisis
or something?


895
00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.004
You could call it that.

896
00:47:49.037 --> 00:47:51.306
Yeah, I'm in the middle of mine
right now.


897
00:47:51.339 --> 00:47:53.541
I really wanna open up
a second Cupcake Palace.


898
00:47:53.574 --> 00:47:55.343
- Really?
- Yeah.


899
00:47:55.376 --> 00:47:56.616
I mean, it's doing really well.

900
00:47:56.644 --> 00:47:59.647
I just...
I wanna see it grow.


901
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.085
Actually, the place that I'm thinking
of opening is really close by.


902
00:48:04.119 --> 00:48:07.255
- Do you wanna go check it out?
- Sure, yes.


903
00:48:07.288 --> 00:48:08.288
Okay.

904
00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:14.996
- Wait, this is a great spot.
- Yeah, assuming I can afford it.


905
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:18.066
I figure it's not too far away
for me to be inconvenient.


906
00:48:18.099 --> 00:48:20.135
Yeah, but far enough way
that it doesn't compete


907
00:48:20.168 --> 00:48:22.637
- with the first bakery.
- Yeah, that's the hope.


908
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.406
- I know it needs a lot of work.
- What?


909
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.408
Yeah, anything will,
but I see the potential.


910
00:48:27.442 --> 00:48:30.912
You know, I could even see like some
outdoor seating area around here.


911
00:48:30.946 --> 00:48:32.447
Yes!
That's what I was thinking.


912
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.683
A Cupcake Palace
would fit right in here.


913
00:48:35.716 --> 00:48:39.354
Feels really good to hear
somebody else say that.


914
00:48:39.387 --> 00:48:42.090
Naw, it's a great idea.

915
00:48:42.123 --> 00:48:44.692
I hope it works for you.

916
00:48:44.725 --> 00:48:45.725
Thanks.

917
00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:48.572
Sometimes I feel a little silly
'cause, you know,


918
00:48:48.596 --> 00:48:51.933
it's just cupcakes, it's not like
I'm saving lives or anything.


919
00:48:51.967 --> 00:48:55.603
Yeah, but cupcakes they...
they cheer people up.


920
00:48:55.636 --> 00:48:59.140
I hadn't thought about it
like that before.


921
00:48:59.174 --> 00:49:01.709
I know it's made a difference
to me.


922
00:49:01.742 --> 00:49:03.111
Really?

923
00:49:03.144 --> 00:49:04.144
Yeah.

924
00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.349
Yeah.

925
00:49:16.524 --> 00:49:17.524
Come on.

926
00:49:21.462 --> 00:49:23.498
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing.


927
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:25.733
I'm amazed you've been talkin'
to what's his name.


928
00:49:25.766 --> 00:49:27.468
I keep calling him "fake Adam".

929
00:49:27.502 --> 00:49:29.070
It's Parker.

930
00:49:29.104 --> 00:49:31.006
- Parker?
- Yeah.


931
00:49:31.039 --> 00:49:35.110
I mean, are you starting
to like him more than Adam?


932
00:49:35.143 --> 00:49:36.344
I'm not sure.

933
00:49:37.712 --> 00:49:39.547
I guess I could be.

934
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.449
But Adam is amazing.

935
00:49:42.383 --> 00:49:44.219
He's a lawyer.

936
00:49:44.252 --> 00:49:46.421
He's wealthy, he's stable,
and all that,


937
00:49:46.454 --> 00:49:48.189
and he's really good looking.

938
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.159
Should Dillon be worried?

939
00:49:53.394 --> 00:49:56.364
Parker seems nice
and he's handsome.


940
00:49:56.397 --> 00:49:59.000
Yeah, I mean,
I'd say Parker.


941
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:01.069
But, there's just...

942
00:50:01.102 --> 00:50:03.538
there's still so much
I don't know about him.


943
00:50:03.571 --> 00:50:05.140
You could say the same
about Adam.


944
00:50:05.173 --> 00:50:06.741
No, not really.

945
00:50:06.774 --> 00:50:10.011
Because he talks about himself
a lot.


946
00:50:11.146 --> 00:50:12.613
Like, all the time.

947
00:50:14.482 --> 00:50:16.751
But with Parker,
I just, I don't know,


948
00:50:16.784 --> 00:50:19.254
he seems really guarded.

949
00:50:19.287 --> 00:50:20.655
What, like he's secretive?

950
00:50:20.688 --> 00:50:21.688
No...

951
00:50:22.457 --> 00:50:24.392
there's just something.

952
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.362
I don't know.

953
00:50:27.395 --> 00:50:28.663
Open up.

954
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:34.735
Those look perfect.

955
00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:37.638
You girls don't have to be here.
I can do this.


956
00:50:37.672 --> 00:50:39.640
You have to choose a cupcake
for the competition.


957
00:50:39.674 --> 00:50:41.442
I know.

958
00:50:41.476 --> 00:50:42.636
Hey you should let that cool.

959
00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:45.146
No, you need to try one

960
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.448
with the peanut butter
creme frosting and the cookie.


961
00:50:47.482 --> 00:50:48.449
Oh yeah.

962
00:50:48.483 --> 00:50:51.086
I just don't know what to pick.

963
00:50:51.119 --> 00:50:52.587
So, what's your favorite so far?

964
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.755
Well, I would say
out of the fruity ones,


965
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:57.525
- I like the strawberry lemon.
- Definitely.


966
00:50:57.558 --> 00:50:59.394
But with the chocolatey...

967
00:50:59.427 --> 00:51:00.295
I don't know.

968
00:51:00.328 --> 00:51:01.672
It just depends on
how these turn out.


969
00:51:01.696 --> 00:51:03.164
I like the cookie dough.

970
00:51:03.198 --> 00:51:05.300
- Nope, it's too sweet.
- Too sweet.


971
00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:07.435
Maybe we need
an outside opinion.


972
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:11.172
Well, we can't ask Chloe
'cause she likes everything.


973
00:51:11.206 --> 00:51:12.473
What about Adam?

974
00:51:12.507 --> 00:51:14.309
You've been talking to Chloe,
haven't you?


975
00:51:15.376 --> 00:51:18.146
I was thinking more
along the lines of Parker.


976
00:51:18.179 --> 00:51:19.179
Well...

977
00:51:20.715 --> 00:51:25.420
Chocolate Peanut butter
is his favorite flavor.


978
00:51:25.453 --> 00:51:29.090
So, Lindsay goes to get a drink
and I see this woman.


979
00:51:29.124 --> 00:51:31.659
Red hair, gorgeous blue eyes,
I mean, she's stunning.


980
00:51:31.692 --> 00:51:32.527
Okay.

981
00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.562
Please, not another one
of these stories.


982
00:51:34.595 --> 00:51:35.663
Just hear me out, okay?

983
00:51:35.696 --> 00:51:38.799
So, there happens to be this guy
standing next to me,


984
00:51:38.833 --> 00:51:42.603
so I just mumble somethin' to him
about how beautiful she is.


985
00:51:42.637 --> 00:51:45.673
- So?
- It was Lindsay's brother.


986
00:51:45.706 --> 00:51:47.408
But, why would he care
if you said that?


987
00:51:47.442 --> 00:51:50.211
Well, I might have been a little
more colorful in my description.


988
00:51:50.245 --> 00:51:51.312
Smooth.

989
00:51:53.481 --> 00:51:54.815
Hi.

990
00:51:54.849 --> 00:51:56.451
- Can we help you?
- Hey!


991
00:51:56.484 --> 00:51:57.318
Hi.

992
00:51:57.352 --> 00:51:59.220
Guys, this is Trish.

993
00:51:59.254 --> 00:52:01.456
- Hey.
- Hey, hi again.


994
00:52:01.489 --> 00:52:03.324
Tom, yeah, it's good to see ya.

995
00:52:03.358 --> 00:52:05.726
We were just gonna go check
our gear somewhere else.


996
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.129
No actually, I could
really use your help.


997
00:52:08.163 --> 00:52:09.163
Really?

998
00:52:10.298 --> 00:52:11.342
I'm tryin' to come up
with a great recipe


999
00:52:11.366 --> 00:52:13.368
for the baking competition
at the end of the week.


1000
00:52:13.401 --> 00:52:16.571
And so, I thought I could use
a second opinion.


1001
00:52:16.604 --> 00:52:19.340
- And a third and a fourth.
- Sweet!


1002
00:52:19.374 --> 00:52:21.641
- I can definitely help there.
- Here.


1003
00:52:22.377 --> 00:52:23.811
Yeah.

1004
00:52:23.844 --> 00:52:26.714
- Well, I'm glad you came by.
- Yeah, me too.


1005
00:52:26.747 --> 00:52:28.583
Is that...
is that peanut butter?


1006
00:52:28.616 --> 00:52:32.153
Yeah, with chocolate.

1007
00:52:35.923 --> 00:52:39.360
- That is amazing.
- Really?


1008
00:52:39.394 --> 00:52:40.604
Do you think it's good enough
to win?


1009
00:52:40.628 --> 00:52:42.430
- I'd vote for this.
- Yeah.


1010
00:52:42.463 --> 00:52:44.165
- I would vote yes.
- But, for which one?


1011
00:52:44.199 --> 00:52:46.734
- Any of 'em.
- That's helpful, yeah.


1012
00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:49.570
- I'll actually try the other one.
- Take 'em all.


1013
00:52:49.604 --> 00:52:50.771
I'll give you a tour.

1014
00:52:50.805 --> 00:52:53.674
Alright, here, enjoy, and make
sure you let me know okay?


1015
00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:56.311
She's got nice cupcakes.

1016
00:52:57.812 --> 00:52:59.880
This is where we keep our gear,
close and convenient


1017
00:52:59.914 --> 00:53:02.817
for when we go out
on calls, train...


1018
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:04.852
You know, we do a lot
of drills and what not.


1019
00:53:08.556 --> 00:53:10.234
I've always wondered
how you work, you know,


1020
00:53:10.258 --> 00:53:12.327
keep steady in the back
of one of these things.


1021
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.729
Well, you ever sit on one
of those big Pilates balls?


1022
00:53:14.762 --> 00:53:15.663
Yeah.

1023
00:53:15.696 --> 00:53:17.898
It's kinda like that.

1024
00:53:20.268 --> 00:53:22.903
We take turns making meals.
Simple, nothing grand.


1025
00:53:22.937 --> 00:53:25.306
Yeah, instant noodles.
Pretty gourmet.


1026
00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:29.544
Which is why a lot of times
we just order take out.


1027
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:33.948
- This is our locker area.
- Nice.


1028
00:53:33.981 --> 00:53:37.618
It's functional.
Your tax dollars at work.


1029
00:53:37.652 --> 00:53:39.987
- Parker.
- Yeah chief?


1030
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.666
I need a signature and some details
on that call from Overton Street.


1031
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:44.392
- I...
- Yeah, it's fine.


1032
00:53:44.425 --> 00:53:46.227
I'll be right back.

1033
00:54:13.421 --> 00:54:15.923
Sorry about that, my...

1034
00:54:15.956 --> 00:54:16.956
Trish?

1035
00:54:18.959 --> 00:54:19.959
Trish?

1036
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:23.298
Leave me alone.

1037
00:54:23.331 --> 00:54:24.741
- Wait, Trish, wait!
- Leave me alone.


1038
00:54:24.765 --> 00:54:26.367
What's going on?

1039
00:54:27.735 --> 00:54:29.770
You're gonna play innocent,
really?


1040
00:54:29.804 --> 00:54:32.507
Whatever it is you think I did,
I'm pretty sure you're wrong.


1041
00:54:33.874 --> 00:54:36.744
'Cause I've caught you
lying to me twice now.


1042
00:54:36.777 --> 00:54:38.913
And what's sad
is it's not just to me.


1043
00:54:38.946 --> 00:54:41.416
What are you talking about?

1044
00:54:41.449 --> 00:54:43.050
Your wife.

1045
00:54:43.083 --> 00:54:44.852
I saw the picture.

1046
00:54:46.321 --> 00:54:47.321
My wife?

1047
00:54:48.689 --> 00:54:52.460
You know, I'm not the kind of person
that does the whole cheating thing.


1048
00:54:52.493 --> 00:54:55.830
So, once and for all
just leave me alone.


1049
00:54:56.731 --> 00:54:58.366
I give up.

1050
00:54:58.399 --> 00:55:00.076
Why put yourself out there
for someone who keeps jumping


1051
00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.502
to conclusions?

1052
00:55:03.538 --> 00:55:05.773
I knew you were hiding something.

1053
00:55:05.806 --> 00:55:06.806
I felt it.

1054
00:55:07.508 --> 00:55:10.745
You wanna assume
the worst about me?


1055
00:55:11.912 --> 00:55:13.080
That's fine.

1056
00:55:13.113 --> 00:55:14.915
I'll leave you alone.

1057
00:55:24.792 --> 00:55:28.896
- So, are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


1058
00:55:28.929 --> 00:55:29.997
I'll be fine.

1059
00:55:31.131 --> 00:55:33.501
He did not seem the type.

1060
00:55:33.534 --> 00:55:35.102
He seemed so nice.

1061
00:55:35.135 --> 00:55:38.539
Yeah, I just,
I was so gullible.


1062
00:55:38.573 --> 00:55:40.775
- No, no you weren't.
- No, no you weren't.


1063
00:55:41.842 --> 00:55:43.878
It doesn't matter anyway.

1064
00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:47.515
Competition is in a couple
of days and I just...


1065
00:55:47.548 --> 00:55:49.884
really need to focus on that.

1066
00:55:51.686 --> 00:55:55.122
So, does this mean
you're giving up on Adam?


1067
00:55:55.155 --> 00:55:59.827
I'm just asking because he asked
Dillon about you yesterday.


1068
00:56:05.533 --> 00:56:06.367
I marked the changes...

1069
00:56:06.401 --> 00:56:08.403
just send them over to Edward,
alright?


1070
00:56:08.436 --> 00:56:09.737
Got it.

1071
00:56:10.771 --> 00:56:13.608
- Hey, Trish, come in!
- Hi.


1072
00:56:13.641 --> 00:56:14.475
Hey!

1073
00:56:14.509 --> 00:56:16.511
- How are ya?
- I'm good.


1074
00:56:16.544 --> 00:56:18.913
Well, thanks for stoppin' by
for lunch today.


1075
00:56:18.946 --> 00:56:19.780
Oh yeah, sure.

1076
00:56:19.814 --> 00:56:20.781
I just need to wrap
some things up here,


1077
00:56:20.815 --> 00:56:23.751
but there's this great place
across the street, it's pretty good.


1078
00:56:23.784 --> 00:56:25.720
Okay, that sounds good.
Great.


1079
00:56:25.753 --> 00:56:29.490
- I brought you my latest.
- It looks delicious.


1080
00:56:29.524 --> 00:56:32.459
- Do you mind if I?
- Yeah, go ahead.


1081
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:37.998
Look at that.

1082
00:56:38.032 --> 00:56:40.768
So, how you been?
It's been awhile.


1083
00:56:40.801 --> 00:56:42.770
Yeah, sorry about that.

1084
00:56:42.803 --> 00:56:44.805
I've been good, I'm good.

1085
00:56:44.839 --> 00:56:46.639
Lately I've just been
a little stressed but...


1086
00:56:47.341 --> 00:56:49.977
Yeah, I've got this big
cupcake competition coming up


1087
00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:51.946
at the end of the week.

1088
00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.015
- You should come.
- For sure, I'll be there.


1089
00:56:55.049 --> 00:56:56.049
Great.

1090
00:56:57.452 --> 00:56:59.454
How about you?
How are things here?


1091
00:56:59.487 --> 00:57:01.922
Oh good.
Just swamped.


1092
00:57:01.956 --> 00:57:04.592
I've got this client
makin' my life difficult.


1093
00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:08.195
He keeps goin' to my boss even though
I'm the attorney on this case.


1094
00:57:08.228 --> 00:57:09.430
I'm sorry.

1095
00:57:09.464 --> 00:57:11.899
Well, I have an idea on how
to calm him down, I just need


1096
00:57:11.932 --> 00:57:14.201
more time to figure it out.

1097
00:57:14.234 --> 00:57:16.471
Which is fine since I can
bill 'em for it too.


1098
00:57:16.504 --> 00:57:19.706
- So, it's still a win.
- There you go.


1099
00:57:20.475 --> 00:57:22.176
Excuse me Adam,
Edward wants to see you.


1100
00:57:22.209 --> 00:57:23.978
Did you send him the changes?

1101
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:25.846
Yes, but I don't think
he's in love with 'em.


1102
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.880
Yeah.

1103
00:57:27.982 --> 00:57:29.216
So sorry.

1104
00:57:29.249 --> 00:57:32.052
- Let's reschedule, okay?
- Okay.


1105
00:57:32.086 --> 00:57:34.154
Thanks for the brownie.

1106
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:36.624
It's a cupcake.

1107
00:57:51.171 --> 00:57:53.508
- Alright, how's that coming?
- We are ready.


1108
00:57:53.541 --> 00:57:55.743
Okay, these just need to go
into the car.


1109
00:57:55.776 --> 00:57:58.045
- Hon, will you grab the cashbox?
- Got it.


1110
00:57:58.078 --> 00:58:00.515
We could use some change though,
coins and ones.


1111
00:58:00.548 --> 00:58:02.249
Okay, I thought I had those
in there.


1112
00:58:02.282 --> 00:58:03.794
Okay, alright,
so these are for the judges.


1113
00:58:03.818 --> 00:58:05.686
And these are to sell.

1114
00:58:07.588 --> 00:58:08.989
Alright, I'll drive.

1115
00:58:09.023 --> 00:58:11.201
You have been working non-stop.
Don't you want me to drive?


1116
00:58:11.225 --> 00:58:12.927
- No, I'm fine.
- Come on!


1117
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.695
Listen, if I drive
I won't be nervous


1118
00:58:14.729 --> 00:58:16.564
about being late to the fair,
okay?


1119
00:58:16.597 --> 00:58:17.597
No, no, no!

1120
00:58:19.967 --> 00:58:23.137
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.


1121
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:26.206
We're done.

1122
00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.808
Do we have more
in the other boxes?


1123
00:58:27.842 --> 00:58:30.244
No, those are the regular flavors
to sell.


1124
00:58:30.277 --> 00:58:33.013
- Maybe we could use one of them.
- Not for the competition.


1125
00:58:33.047 --> 00:58:34.190
They have to be new and special.

1126
00:58:34.214 --> 00:58:36.651
Maybe we could salvage.

1127
00:58:36.684 --> 00:58:40.187
No, okay, we just have to...
we have to make more.


1128
00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:44.024
- What's the recipe?
- We don't have enough time.


1129
00:58:44.058 --> 00:58:45.058
Piper.

1130
00:59:01.075 --> 00:59:02.843
- Where's the cocoa?
- There.


1131
00:59:02.877 --> 00:59:04.612
How much peanut butter
in the frosting?


1132
00:59:04.645 --> 00:59:06.146
I would do just maybe two or...

1133
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.982
- What are you guys doing?
- What we do best.


1134
00:59:08.015 --> 00:59:09.784
No, I told you,
we don't have enough time.


1135
00:59:09.817 --> 00:59:11.719
There is if you'll let us help.

1136
00:59:11.752 --> 00:59:14.622
I can drive to the competition now
and start setting up.


1137
00:59:14.655 --> 00:59:16.567
And maybe the judge won't come
to our booth first.


1138
00:59:16.591 --> 00:59:17.524
Okay?

1139
00:59:17.558 --> 00:59:18.158
We can drive over
as soon as we're done here.


1140
00:59:18.192 --> 00:59:20.595
You know, we can do this.

1141
00:59:25.232 --> 00:59:28.168
Half cup.
Peanut butter in the frosting.


1142
00:59:28.202 --> 00:59:29.236
I'll see you there.

1143
00:59:29.269 --> 00:59:30.981
Piper, can you make sure
that you call Chloe?


1144
00:59:31.005 --> 00:59:32.573
She should be on her way over
to help,


1145
00:59:32.607 --> 00:59:36.176
and make sure you reserve a spot
where we can stage these for the judges.


1146
00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:38.012
- Got it.
- Great.


1147
00:59:38.045 --> 00:59:38.913
Wait, no, no, no, no,
not as much water.


1148
00:59:38.946 --> 00:59:39.780
Okay.

1149
00:59:39.814 --> 00:59:40.915
Right.

1150
00:59:40.948 --> 00:59:42.192
And make sure you add
a little bit of evaporated milk.


1151
00:59:42.216 --> 00:59:43.350
Got it.

1152
00:59:43.383 --> 00:59:45.095
- And did you make sure...
- Trish, you make the frosting.


1153
00:59:45.119 --> 00:59:46.220
Okay.

1154
01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:12.179
Welcome to this year's
Cup of Cakes competition!


1155
01:00:12.212 --> 01:00:15.315
We're grateful for our sponsor,
Fine Baking,


1156
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:19.687
who is making this possible
with a grand prize of $30,000


1157
01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:23.190
to the winner!

1158
01:00:23.223 --> 01:00:24.223
Yes!

1159
01:00:26.393 --> 01:00:30.631
Our judges are just getting ready
to start their rounds now.


1160
01:00:30.665 --> 01:00:32.900
So, we'll leave it
to their taste buds


1161
01:00:32.933 --> 01:00:35.202
to find the best cupcake!

1162
01:00:42.376 --> 01:00:44.178
Okay, okay, okay,
here they come.


1163
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:45.946
Oh thank goodness.

1164
01:00:46.847 --> 01:00:50.718
- Hey, where are they?
- The judges are coming right now.


1165
01:00:52.753 --> 01:00:55.022
- Around in a circle, there ya go.
- There, all done.


1166
01:00:55.055 --> 01:00:56.055
Great.

1167
01:00:58.325 --> 01:01:00.728
Take that, take that.

1168
01:01:00.761 --> 01:01:01.528
Hello.

1169
01:01:01.561 --> 01:01:04.699
Hi, welcome
to the Cupcake Palace.


1170
01:01:04.732 --> 01:01:06.701
Tell us about it.

1171
01:01:06.734 --> 01:01:09.837
This is a chocolate based cupcake
with a hint of hazelnut,


1172
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:11.706
freshly ground peanuts.

1173
01:01:11.739 --> 01:01:15.142
It's got the filling
of white chocolate mousse,


1174
01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:18.412
and it's topped with
amlight peanut butter frosting


1175
01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:20.280
and a miniature
peanut butter, cookie.


1176
01:01:20.314 --> 01:01:24.719
- And the drizzle?
- The drizzle is a dark chocolate.


1177
01:01:27.788 --> 01:01:30.424
- Okay?
- Okay, thanks.


1178
01:01:30.457 --> 01:01:32.726
Thank you.
Bye-bye.


1179
01:01:34.962 --> 01:01:39.233
- What do you think?
- I don't know. It's over now.


1180
01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.674
It's not a bake off.

1181
01:01:49.143 --> 01:01:50.190
I hate these things,

1182
01:01:50.214 --> 01:01:52.479
just sittin' around all day,
nothin' to do.


1183
01:01:52.512 --> 01:01:57.051
How is that any different
from what we do normally?


1184
01:01:57.084 --> 01:02:00.187
At least at the fire station,
I have some distractions, you know?


1185
01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.990
What like losing at hoops
all day?


1186
01:02:03.023 --> 01:02:05.926
Hey, one game
is not all day, sir.


1187
01:02:09.196 --> 01:02:10.196
Hey!

1188
01:02:11.165 --> 01:02:12.900
Not so bad now, is it?

1189
01:02:12.933 --> 01:02:15.001
- No, can we do CPR...
- No.


1190
01:02:27.414 --> 01:02:28.883
Thank you.

1191
01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:32.186
- What is taking so long?
- I don't know.


1192
01:02:32.219 --> 01:02:36.056
- Why don't they give us the results?
- Just be patient.


1193
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.957
- I'll be back.
- Okay.


1194
01:02:42.229 --> 01:02:44.164
- Hi.
- Hi.


1195
01:02:44.198 --> 01:02:44.932
Remember me?

1196
01:02:44.965 --> 01:02:48.168
- Yeah, Tom, right?
- Yeah, yeah.


1197
01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:50.237
Wait, what are you doing here?

1198
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.808
On duty
in case of any emergencies.


1199
01:02:55.142 --> 01:02:57.344
I guess that makes sense.

1200
01:02:59.579 --> 01:03:02.516
Listen, do you have a minute
we could talk?


1201
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:04.384
Well, actually,
I'm really busy right now...


1202
01:03:04.418 --> 01:03:06.186
It's about Parker.

1203
01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.889
Please?
Just hear me out.


1204
01:03:12.259 --> 01:03:15.062
Parker wasn't always
a paramedic.


1205
01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:20.067
He was a life science teacher
or something at a high school.


1206
01:03:21.168 --> 01:03:27.507
About three years ago, his wife,
Elaine, had a heart attack,


1207
01:03:29.476 --> 01:03:30.878
and Parker found her
at the house.


1208
01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:34.480
He'd come straight home
after work and...


1209
01:03:36.216 --> 01:03:38.552
he tried to save her, but he...

1210
01:03:39.954 --> 01:03:41.221
She passed away.

1211
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:46.326
He was kind of a zombie
for awhile there.


1212
01:03:47.394 --> 01:03:49.263
Then he pulled himself together
and he decided


1213
01:03:49.296 --> 01:03:51.007
he didn't wanna let that happen
to anyone else


1214
01:03:51.031 --> 01:03:53.367
if he could help it.

1215
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.270
And that's when he became
a paramedic.


1216
01:03:56.303 --> 01:03:59.406
He went through
all the training...


1217
01:03:59.439 --> 01:04:01.108
just dove right in.

1218
01:04:02.142 --> 01:04:03.142
I...

1219
01:04:04.278 --> 01:04:05.412
I had no idea.

1220
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:14.321
He hasn't really been very open
to relationships for a long time.


1221
01:04:17.657 --> 01:04:21.996
But he said you ordered
something strange the day you met.


1222
01:04:22.997 --> 01:04:25.032
The very same thing
his wife used to order


1223
01:04:25.065 --> 01:04:26.600
when they ate there.

1224
01:04:27.935 --> 01:04:29.336
And it...

1225
01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:31.371
it caught him off guard.

1226
01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.842
Or maybe it woke him up.

1227
01:04:36.944 --> 01:04:39.346
Anyway, I just thought...

1228
01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:42.349
I thought you should know
the truth.


1229
01:04:44.518 --> 01:04:48.855
I probably should get back,
keep Milo out of trouble.


1230
01:04:49.623 --> 01:04:50.623
Take care.

1231
01:04:51.491 --> 01:04:52.492
Thank you.

1232
01:04:59.633 --> 01:05:01.535
If we can get everyone
to gather in,


1233
01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:06.340
we're ready to announce
the winners of the competition.


1234
01:05:06.373 --> 01:05:07.373
Okay.

1235
01:05:09.676 --> 01:05:12.512
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have the results


1236
01:05:12.546 --> 01:05:14.648
of the Cup of Cakes competition.

1237
01:05:17.251 --> 01:05:19.519
Let me just say that wow!

1238
01:05:19.553 --> 01:05:22.923
Every baker here
brought their A game.


1239
01:05:22.957 --> 01:05:25.459
I've been looking forward to this,
and let me tell you,


1240
01:05:25.492 --> 01:05:28.195
I was not disappointed.

1241
01:05:29.396 --> 01:05:30.364
Enough with the speeches already.

1242
01:05:30.397 --> 01:05:35.269
Unfortunately, we can't make
everyone a winner.


1243
01:05:35.302 --> 01:05:39.310
So, the third place winner is...

1244
01:05:40.074 --> 01:05:41.275
Lena Albertson.

1245
01:05:44.478 --> 01:05:48.348
Lena used her grandmother's
prized apple strudel recipe


1246
01:05:48.382 --> 01:05:50.985
as inspiration for her cupcake.

1247
01:05:51.018 --> 01:05:52.619
Thank you, Lena.

1248
01:05:52.652 --> 01:05:54.321
That's nice, right?

1249
01:05:54.354 --> 01:05:58.497
And our second place winner is...

1250
01:05:59.359 --> 01:06:01.328
The Hey Batter Batter Bakery.

1251
01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:02.362
Yeah!

1252
01:06:04.531 --> 01:06:07.401
Didn't they win last year?

1253
01:06:08.535 --> 01:06:11.571
The Hey Batter Batter Bakery
used a key lime cupcake


1254
01:06:11.605 --> 01:06:15.042
topped with a raspberry-lime
frosting,


1255
01:06:15.075 --> 01:06:17.411
and a sugar lime wedge
on the top.


1256
01:06:17.444 --> 01:06:18.979
Congratulations.

1257
01:06:20.414 --> 01:06:24.518
Alright, now,
for the grand prize winner,


1258
01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:27.554
who will not only get
the winning recipe printed


1259
01:06:27.587 --> 01:06:31.191
on the back of Fine Baking
products,


1260
01:06:31.225 --> 01:06:35.162
but will also go home
with $30,000.


1261
01:06:37.764 --> 01:06:40.167
The Cupcake Palace!

1262
01:06:49.509 --> 01:06:53.213
The Cupcake Palace
created a chocolate cupcake


1263
01:06:53.247 --> 01:06:56.216
with a filling of white
chocolate mousse.


1264
01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:58.552
On top, it's garnished
with a perfect


1265
01:06:58.585 --> 01:07:02.389
peanut butter frosting,
and a miniature cookie.


1266
01:07:02.422 --> 01:07:03.490
Congratulations!

1267
01:07:19.606 --> 01:07:21.208
So, when you get
your second bakery,


1268
01:07:21.241 --> 01:07:23.110
do I get to be manager?

1269
01:07:23.843 --> 01:07:25.112
Easy Piper.

1270
01:07:26.513 --> 01:07:27.514
We'll see.

1271
01:07:28.448 --> 01:07:29.825
Girls, so I really
couldn't have done this


1272
01:07:29.849 --> 01:07:32.352
without you today,
thank you so much.


1273
01:07:32.386 --> 01:07:33.629
Well, you just try
to remember that.


1274
01:07:33.653 --> 01:07:35.655
Yeah, especially
around bonus time.


1275
01:07:37.191 --> 01:07:39.059
It's out of control.

1276
01:07:44.664 --> 01:07:45.465
Is that ready?

1277
01:07:45.499 --> 01:07:47.634
Yeah, you can take that,
thank you.


1278
01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:48.667
Good.

1279
01:08:02.582 --> 01:08:03.582
Hi.

1280
01:08:04.684 --> 01:08:06.820
What are you doin' here?

1281
01:08:10.124 --> 01:08:15.462
I ran into Tom at the competition,
and he told me about your wife.


1282
01:08:17.764 --> 01:08:19.366
So?

1283
01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:24.104
So, I wanted to apologize.
That's why I'm here.


1284
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:26.840
Don't trouble yourself.

1285
01:08:28.442 --> 01:08:30.144
I should never have jumped
to conclusions.


1286
01:08:30.177 --> 01:08:33.612
I feel horrible
about how I treated you and...


1287
01:08:35.182 --> 01:08:36.182
I'm sorry.

1288
01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920
You done?

1289
01:08:44.524 --> 01:08:45.524
Yeah.

1290
01:08:47.161 --> 01:08:49.896
Parker, are you even gonna say
something, anything?


1291
01:08:49.929 --> 01:08:54.301
I didn't tell you about Elaine
'cause I didn't want your sympathy.


1292
01:08:54.334 --> 01:08:58.438
What's wrong with sympathy
if it helps me understand better?


1293
01:08:58.472 --> 01:09:01.208
If you would have told me
about her and your situation...


1294
01:09:01.241 --> 01:09:02.442
My situation?

1295
01:09:03.443 --> 01:09:07.214
Have you even considered that maybe
I wanted you to see me for me?


1296
01:09:07.247 --> 01:09:09.616
Not some widower to be pitied.

1297
01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:11.685
Besides, I'm not someone
who'd use her memory


1298
01:09:11.718 --> 01:09:13.687
as a pick up line to get
some woman's attention.


1299
01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:18.292
- I never would have thought that.
- You sure?


1300
01:09:18.325 --> 01:09:21.761
Parker you never told me anything
about your past.


1301
01:09:21.795 --> 01:09:23.463
What was I supposed to think?

1302
01:09:23.497 --> 01:09:25.732
I was beginning to worry
that, I don't know,


1303
01:09:25.765 --> 01:09:27.834
maybe you were hiding something.

1304
01:09:27.867 --> 01:09:33.373
Trish, Trish, I am tired
of trying to prove myself to you.


1305
01:09:33.407 --> 01:09:35.851
You're always tryin' to find
some way for us not to be together.


1306
01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:38.712
- No, I'm not.
- Honey, it's not worth it anymore.


1307
01:09:38.745 --> 01:09:40.714
- Parker I...
- Look, what did you say?


1308
01:09:40.747 --> 01:09:44.851
Something about how we weren't
supposed to meet anyway.


1309
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:50.757
I mean, the only reason we did
was because of a time change.


1310
01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:55.928
So, please just go on with your life
and I'll go on with mine.


1311
01:10:47.046 --> 01:10:50.650
When's the next order of creme
coming in?


1312
01:10:51.751 --> 01:10:52.986
Trish?

1313
01:10:54.454 --> 01:10:55.454
Cream?

1314
01:10:56.323 --> 01:10:59.693
- Are we getting more in soon?
- Yeah, tomorrow.


1315
01:11:00.894 --> 01:11:03.263
- Can you take that?
- Yeah.


1316
01:11:03.297 --> 01:11:04.297
Thanks.

1317
01:11:09.569 --> 01:11:13.907
Excuse me, is this the place I can
find an award winning cupcake?


1318
01:11:15.309 --> 01:11:16.519
I told my boss about it,
but of course,


1319
01:11:16.543 --> 01:11:18.312
he doesn't want to hear
any bad news.


1320
01:11:18.345 --> 01:11:20.580
Even though I clearly
had a solution of my own.


1321
01:11:20.614 --> 01:11:21.581
Sort of.

1322
01:11:21.615 --> 01:11:23.326
So I spend the rest of the day
digging through


1323
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:25.852
all the ideas I could find
on how to calm him down


1324
01:11:25.885 --> 01:11:27.687
so that he'd be
in a listening mood.


1325
01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:29.623
- And did it work?
- Not fast enough.


1326
01:11:29.656 --> 01:11:34.328
He over reacts and chews out
the other side, which will cost us.


1327
01:11:34.361 --> 01:11:36.029
But hey, not my fault.

1328
01:11:36.062 --> 01:11:40.700
I think it'll be good though because
he'll still see that I was right.


1329
01:11:40.734 --> 01:11:42.969
Might even help with the
whole partner thing, too.


1330
01:11:43.002 --> 01:11:43.837
Yeah that's great.

1331
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:46.039
Of course,
then I find out that Jimmy,


1332
01:11:46.072 --> 01:11:48.475
who's been at the firm
three years longer than me,


1333
01:11:48.508 --> 01:11:50.310
has been lobbying for partner too.

1334
01:11:50.344 --> 01:11:52.479
Not sure what I'll do about that.

1335
01:11:52.512 --> 01:11:56.483
I mean, he's a nice guy,
but no killer instinct.


1336
01:11:58.685 --> 01:11:59.685
Hey...

1337
01:12:00.554 --> 01:12:01.554
you okay?

1338
01:12:04.123 --> 01:12:05.123
Adam?

1339
01:12:06.059 --> 01:12:07.627
Yeah?

1340
01:12:07.661 --> 01:12:11.129
- I don't think this makes sense.
- What?


1341
01:12:14.434 --> 01:12:17.437
Well, grand prize winner,
how's it feel?


1342
01:12:17.471 --> 01:12:18.472
Wonderful.

1343
01:12:19.773 --> 01:12:21.708
You gonna go ahead and open up
a new store then?


1344
01:12:21.741 --> 01:12:23.453
Yeah, I actually signed
the paperwork yesterday.


1345
01:12:23.477 --> 01:12:24.611
Good.

1346
01:12:24.644 --> 01:12:27.481
- I'm glad this is working out for you.
- Yeah me too.


1347
01:12:28.982 --> 01:12:32.519
Too bad it didn't work out
with Adam.


1348
01:12:32.552 --> 01:12:34.020
It really was amicable.

1349
01:12:34.053 --> 01:12:35.855
Really, he was really
understanding.


1350
01:12:35.889 --> 01:12:38.658
Of course he was.
Because he's a great guy.


1351
01:12:38.692 --> 01:12:40.660
Listen Chloe,
I know that you liked him,


1352
01:12:40.694 --> 01:12:42.996
but that, it just wasn't enough.

1353
01:12:43.029 --> 01:12:45.932
- I thought you liked him too.
- I did and I do...


1354
01:12:45.965 --> 01:12:49.569
just not as much
as he likes himself.


1355
01:12:52.872 --> 01:12:54.517
Do you know what he said
when I told him that we could


1356
01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:56.743
- no longer see each other?
- What?


1357
01:12:56.776 --> 01:12:59.913
He said that it was okay
because he needed somebody


1358
01:12:59.946 --> 01:13:02.982
that was more focused on him.

1359
01:13:03.883 --> 01:13:05.519
Oh my gosh!

1360
01:13:10.957 --> 01:13:12.826
Are you gonna be okay?

1361
01:13:15.429 --> 01:13:18.432
Yes.
I'm gonna be fine.


1362
01:13:18.465 --> 01:13:20.810
I will, I'm gonna be fine.
I have so much to keep me busy


1363
01:13:20.834 --> 01:13:24.504
with the second store opening,
and if all goes well,


1364
01:13:24.538 --> 01:13:27.674
hopefully we'll be open
by the end of the year.


1365
01:14:19.826 --> 01:14:21.695
- Lookin' good.
- Thank you.


1366
01:16:01.127 --> 01:16:03.613
Alright, remember to behave
and don't touch anything


1367
01:16:03.813 --> 01:16:05.699
unless the firemen
say it's okay, alright?


1368
01:16:05.732 --> 01:16:06.766
Hello kids.

1369
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.867
- Hi.
- Hello.


1370
01:16:09.368 --> 01:16:11.971
Who wants to learn all about
what we do here?


1371
01:16:12.005 --> 01:16:13.907
Fight fires!

1372
01:16:14.874 --> 01:16:16.643
Yes we do.

1373
01:16:16.676 --> 01:16:18.978
Now, we share the fire station
with a paramedic crew.


1374
01:16:19.012 --> 01:16:21.114
Who can tell me
what a paramedic is?


1375
01:16:21.147 --> 01:16:24.684
- They drive ambulances.
- Yes they do.


1376
01:16:24.718 --> 01:16:28.021
And over there
are our paramedics.


1377
01:16:28.054 --> 01:16:32.091
Not only do they drive ambulances,
but more importantly,


1378
01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:34.628
they help people
who are sick or injured.


1379
01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:37.301
Why don't you follow me over here,
I'll show you some fire engines.


1380
01:16:43.236 --> 01:16:46.606
Oh, Brooke, no!
No, no honey, don't drink that!


1381
01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.640
It's yucky!

1382
01:16:49.976 --> 01:16:52.912
- Why do kids do that?
- Kids will be kids, I guess.


1383
01:16:52.946 --> 01:16:54.848
I know, but I don't want her
to get sick.


1384
01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:55.881
Yeah.

1385
01:16:58.384 --> 01:17:01.320
I went with Brooklyn's preschool
on their field trip to the fire station.


1386
01:17:01.354 --> 01:17:02.354
Oh yeah?

1387
01:17:03.289 --> 01:17:05.091
Yeah, I saw Parker.

1388
01:17:06.225 --> 01:17:08.795
Don't worry,
I didn't say anything.


1389
01:17:08.828 --> 01:17:11.865
I don't think
he even recognized me, so.


1390
01:17:11.898 --> 01:17:14.399
- How did he look?
- The same.


1391
01:17:17.303 --> 01:17:20.907
You know that I just want you
to be happy?


1392
01:17:21.841 --> 01:17:23.486
Ever since mom and dad died,

1393
01:17:23.542 --> 01:17:27.527
I tried my best to help
give you a good big sister.


1394
01:17:27.847 --> 01:17:29.382
You were, you are.

1395
01:17:31.918 --> 01:17:34.220
It's just, I know
I can be overbearing


1396
01:17:34.253 --> 01:17:36.890
and with the whole date
set up thing, well,


1397
01:17:36.923 --> 01:17:39.192
they haven't all been great.

1398
01:17:42.028 --> 01:17:44.230
But the thing is,
you just had to find something


1399
01:17:44.263 --> 01:17:46.399
wrong with every single one
no matter what.


1400
01:17:46.432 --> 01:17:48.334
And that really frustrated me.

1401
01:17:48.367 --> 01:17:50.236
That's 'cause it's not
your responsibility.


1402
01:17:50.269 --> 01:17:54.373
I know, but it doesn't mean
I don't care.


1403
01:17:54.407 --> 01:17:57.276
I'm not saying they're perfect.

1404
01:17:57.310 --> 01:18:01.414
But you and Parker clicked,
and that didn't happen


1405
01:18:01.447 --> 01:18:02.949
with anyone else.

1406
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:05.350
So?

1407
01:18:06.185 --> 01:18:07.921
So what do you think
you would have thought


1408
01:18:07.954 --> 01:18:10.690
of Adam if there were no Parker?

1409
01:18:14.828 --> 01:18:18.064
I think maybe you were
punishing Parker,


1410
01:18:19.265 --> 01:18:23.102
and that's why
you accepted Adam so easily.


1411
01:18:23.136 --> 01:18:24.213
Okay, why are you tellin' me
all this?


1412
01:18:24.237 --> 01:18:26.439
Are you just tellin' me this
to make me feel worse?


1413
01:18:26.472 --> 01:18:27.473
No.

1414
01:18:27.506 --> 01:18:29.346
I'm telling you this
because I want you to know


1415
01:18:29.375 --> 01:18:32.178
that Parker
is probably hurt too.


1416
01:18:33.346 --> 01:18:34.714
And no matter what he did,

1417
01:18:34.748 --> 01:18:35.882
what you said,

1418
01:18:39.252 --> 01:18:43.389
maybe he needs a chance
to fall in love with you again.


1419
01:18:48.161 --> 01:18:49.929
And that wraps up
our evening set.


1420
01:18:49.963 --> 01:18:51.330
It's 10:30.

1421
01:18:51.364 --> 01:18:53.008
Remember to set back your clocks
tonight with the end


1422
01:18:53.032 --> 01:18:54.768
of Daylight Savings.

1423
01:18:59.906 --> 01:19:01.174
Hey, I can do that.

1424
01:19:01.207 --> 01:19:03.318
Oh no, it's good, I'm fine.
You go ahead and take off.


1425
01:19:03.342 --> 01:19:06.512
- You sure you don't need any help?
- Yeah, you can close on Monday.


1426
01:19:06.545 --> 01:19:07.545
Alright.

1427
01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:09.615
I almost forgot.

1428
01:19:09.648 --> 01:19:11.885
Chloe was in here earlier
and wanted me to remind you


1429
01:19:11.918 --> 01:19:14.053
about breakfast tomorrow morning
at nine.


1430
01:19:14.087 --> 01:19:16.790
Right, right, thanks for that.
I'll text her.


1431
01:19:16.823 --> 01:19:19.124
- Okay, have a good night.
- You too.


1432
01:19:27.233 --> 01:19:29.869
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.


1433
01:19:29.903 --> 01:19:32.171
No.

1434
01:19:33.072 --> 01:19:34.307
Rice.

1435
01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:36.876
I gotta get rice.
I gotta get rice.


1436
01:20:02.401 --> 01:20:03.837
- Hi.
- Hi.


1437
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:05.038
How many in your party?

1438
01:20:05.071 --> 01:20:08.541
Two, actually, but I think
she must be running late.


1439
01:20:08.574 --> 01:20:11.277
Do you wanna be seated or
would you like to wait for her?


1440
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:13.012
Yeah, I think, can I just wait?

1441
01:20:13.613 --> 01:20:14.814
Okay, thanks.

1442
01:20:19.352 --> 01:20:20.153
- Hi.
- Hi.


1443
01:20:20.186 --> 01:20:21.463
I'm here to pick up
a to go order.


1444
01:20:21.487 --> 01:20:23.422
- Okay, what's the name?
- Parker.


1445
01:20:23.456 --> 01:20:24.858
Parker, okay.

1446
01:20:38.423 --> 01:20:40.138
- Hi.
- Hi.


1447
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.677
- You waiting for someone?
- Chloe actually.


1448
01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:47.180
She's supposed to meet me here
for breakfast at nine.


1449
01:20:47.213 --> 01:20:49.615
Of course, she's running late.

1450
01:20:49.648 --> 01:20:52.852
Did you forget what day it is?

1451
01:20:52.886 --> 01:20:55.254
- It's Sunday.
- Naw, that's not what I meant.


1452
01:20:55.288 --> 01:20:58.424
It's actually eight o'clock
right now.


1453
01:20:59.392 --> 01:21:02.295
- What?
- Time change.


1454
01:21:02.328 --> 01:21:05.131
My guess is
that you're an hour early.


1455
01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:06.832
No, no no no, no.

1456
01:21:07.967 --> 01:21:11.076
- Did you fry your cell phone again?
- Drowned it actually, yeah.


1457
01:21:11.104 --> 01:21:13.306
Okay, what about
your alarm clock?


1458
01:21:13.339 --> 01:21:15.017
Well you know, it works,
but only if you...


1459
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:17.310
- ...set it right.
- Set it right.


1460
01:21:18.311 --> 01:21:23.016
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't make
any plans near Daylight Savings.


1461
01:21:23.049 --> 01:21:24.049
Maybe.

1462
01:21:27.286 --> 01:21:30.356
But, then I never would
have met you.


1463
01:21:35.261 --> 01:21:37.997
- Here's your food.
- Alright, thank you.


1464
01:21:38.031 --> 01:21:39.697
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.


1465
01:21:42.201 --> 01:21:43.201
It was...

1466
01:21:49.008 --> 01:21:50.143
see ya around.

1467
01:21:51.444 --> 01:21:52.444
You too.

1468
01:22:06.192 --> 01:22:07.192
Parker.

1469
01:22:09.028 --> 01:22:09.963
Yeah?

1470
01:22:09.996 --> 01:22:11.064
- Hey.
- Hey.


1471
01:22:14.133 --> 01:22:16.902
- How have you been?
- Good, you?


1472
01:22:18.737 --> 01:22:20.139
Yeah, me too.

1473
01:22:23.142 --> 01:22:25.711
Chloe saw you the other day
at her daughter's field trip.


1474
01:22:25.744 --> 01:22:26.744
Oh good.

1475
01:22:28.047 --> 01:22:31.217
- How is she?
- Fine, yeah, thanks.


1476
01:22:33.052 --> 01:22:36.422
- Is the oven still workin'?
- Yes.


1477
01:22:36.455 --> 01:22:40.393
Yeah, I haven't had any problems
with it since you fixed it.


1478
01:22:40.426 --> 01:22:44.697
I saw something about the new
bakery, it's opening soon, isn't it?


1479
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:46.632
Yeah, this week.

1480
01:22:46.665 --> 01:22:48.134
You should come.

1481
01:22:50.403 --> 01:22:53.506
I'm glad things are going well
for you.


1482
01:22:53.539 --> 01:22:57.210
I made the chocolate peanut butter
cup cake regular on the menu.


1483
01:22:57.243 --> 01:22:58.544
Oh yeah?

1484
01:22:58.577 --> 01:23:01.247
Yeah, so if you're
in the neighborhood,


1485
01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.681
it's on the house.

1486
01:23:08.021 --> 01:23:09.021
Well...

1487
01:23:11.357 --> 01:23:13.559
it was really good seeing you.

1488
01:23:13.592 --> 01:23:14.592
You too.

1489
01:23:16.462 --> 01:23:17.462
Take care.

1490
01:23:34.413 --> 01:23:37.750
- Good, I'm starving.
- What'd you get?


1491
01:23:37.783 --> 01:23:38.984
The usual.

1492
01:23:41.955 --> 01:23:44.672
So, I got a thing.

1493
01:23:45.458 --> 01:23:47.526
My cousin's wedding
I gotta go to it.


1494
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.762
So, could one of you
cover my shift on Friday?


1495
01:23:49.795 --> 01:23:51.764
I've got plans.

1496
01:23:51.797 --> 01:23:55.201
This Friday?
You didn't block it off?


1497
01:23:55.234 --> 01:23:57.670
- No.
- Do you have a date?


1498
01:23:57.703 --> 01:24:01.450
Of course, I have a date.
Who are you talkin' to here?


1499
01:24:01.474 --> 01:24:04.543
So you have a date before you have
someone to cover your shift.


1500
01:24:04.577 --> 01:24:05.577
Smart.

1501
01:24:07.546 --> 01:24:10.349
Look don't hate on me, okay?
It's my cousin's wedding.


1502
01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:12.085
Alright?

1503
01:24:12.118 --> 01:24:13.386
But the date.

1504
01:24:18.724 --> 01:24:20.293
Fine, so you're out.

1505
01:24:20.326 --> 01:24:24.097
How about you?
You gonna hook a brother up?


1506
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:27.200
- Parker?
- What?


1507
01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.368
Are you here man?

1508
01:24:29.402 --> 01:24:32.171
I'm sorry, sorry.

1509
01:24:32.205 --> 01:24:34.207
You okay?
What's up?


1510
01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.175
Just I saw Trish.

1511
01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:39.745
- When?
- Just now at the restaurant.


1512
01:24:39.778 --> 01:24:42.115
So, how was it?

1513
01:24:42.148 --> 01:24:44.517
It was awkward.

1514
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:47.520
It means you're still
not over her.


1515
01:24:47.553 --> 01:24:49.122
What?

1516
01:24:49.155 --> 01:24:50.556
Why?

1517
01:24:50.589 --> 01:24:53.859
Just does, right?

1518
01:24:53.892 --> 01:24:56.095
I haven't talked to her
in months.


1519
01:24:56.129 --> 01:24:58.731
But you're still thinkin'
about her.


1520
01:24:58.764 --> 01:25:00.666
Maybe.

1521
01:25:00.699 --> 01:25:03.869
You should do somethin'
about it.


1522
01:25:03.902 --> 01:25:07.173
Oh come on, guys.
You know the history.


1523
01:25:07.206 --> 01:25:09.875
It's not gonna happen.

1524
01:25:09.908 --> 01:25:12.178
Yeah, but, you're still thinkin'
about her


1525
01:25:12.211 --> 01:25:15.281
and things are still awkward,

1526
01:25:15.314 --> 01:25:18.151
means you probably wish
you could go back and change things.


1527
01:25:23.622 --> 01:25:26.625
So, where are we on my shift?
Alright?


1528
01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:39.605
Thanks for comin' in.

1529
01:25:42.441 --> 01:25:45.278
We have half a tray of
chocolate croissants left.


1530
01:25:45.311 --> 01:25:49.215
- That's all that's left?
- We totally sold out.


1531
01:25:49.882 --> 01:25:51.884
This came for you.

1532
01:26:02.361 --> 01:26:04.463
"I'd like to give us another chance,

1533
01:26:04.497 --> 01:26:07.300
"can you give me the time of day?"

1534
01:26:08.467 --> 01:26:11.570
Looks like the store's a hit.

1535
01:26:11.604 --> 01:26:14.607
Yeah, we've had a really good day.

1536
01:26:16.209 --> 01:26:18.877
It's a self updating alarm clock.

1537
01:26:18.911 --> 01:26:21.747
It automatically adjusts
to Daylight Savings time.


1538
01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:23.782
Both in the spring and the fall.

1539
01:26:23.816 --> 01:26:28.521
So, even if you break your phone,
you'll always have the correct time.


1540
01:26:28.554 --> 01:26:32.691
Well, I definitely could use this,
so, thank you.


1541
01:26:36.795 --> 01:26:40.733
Look, I'm really, really sorry
about what happened before.


1542
01:26:40.766 --> 01:26:41.766
I know.

1543
01:26:43.702 --> 01:26:44.702
Me too.

1544
01:26:48.241 --> 01:26:50.509
I was hiding things.

1545
01:26:50.543 --> 01:26:53.246
I didn't want to think
about my past, so I tried


1546
01:26:53.279 --> 01:26:56.782
to bury it and
that made things worse.


1547
01:26:56.815 --> 01:26:59.852
But I can definitely
understand why.


1548
01:26:59.885 --> 01:27:00.885
Thanks.

1549
01:27:03.256 --> 01:27:06.859
You know, I'm starting
to believe in destiny.


1550
01:27:07.793 --> 01:27:10.463
- Oh really?
- Lately, yeah.


1551
01:27:10.496 --> 01:27:13.566
I mean, who knew somethin'
as simple as a time change


1552
01:27:13.599 --> 01:27:15.401
could lead me to you?

1553
01:27:17.603 --> 01:27:19.672
Do you mean that?

1554
01:27:19.705 --> 01:27:20.705
Yeah.

1555
01:27:21.974 --> 01:27:26.612
Besides, I think we've wasted
enough time, don't you think?


1556
01:27:26.645 --> 01:27:27.645
Yeah.

1557
01:27:35.788 --> 01:27:39.658
Hey, can you help me
set this up?


1558
01:27:39.692 --> 01:27:41.026
Or whatever?

1559
01:27:41.059 --> 01:27:42.828
- It's a clock.
- Yeah, I know.


1560
