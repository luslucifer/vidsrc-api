1
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.810
Red and white.

2
00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:09.896
Blue suede shoes.

3
00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:13.150
I'm Uncle Sam.

4
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.653
How do you do?

5
00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:19.740
Give me five.

6
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.118
I'm still alive.

7
00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.288
Ain't no luck.

8
00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.082
I learned to duck.

9
00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.922
Check my pulse.

10
00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:38.925
It don't change.

11
00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:42.345
Stay seventy two,

12
00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:45.766
come shine or rain.

13
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:49.311
Wave the flag.

14
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:52.481
Pop the bag,

15
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.692
rock the boat,

16
00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:57.403
skin the goat.

17
00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:06.495
Wave that flag.

18
00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.957
Wave it wide and high.

19
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.716
Summertime done,

20
00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:21.094
come and gone.

21
00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:25.931
Well this job I got,

22
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.517
is just a little too hard,

23
00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:29.726
uh-huh.

24
00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:33.730
Running out of money, Lord,
I need more pay.


25
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.608
I'm gonna wake up
in the morning, Lord.


26
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.027
I'm gonna pack my bags.

27
00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:43.740
I'm gonna beat it on down the line.

28
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:46.368
- I'm goin' down the line.
- (goin' down the line)


29
00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:56.369
- Goin' down the line.
- (goin' down the line)


30
00:04:57.171 --> 00:05:00.216
- Goin' down the line.
- (goin' down the line)


31
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:04.637
I'm gonna beat it on down the line.

32
00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:09.659
The wheel is turning and
you can't slow down.


33
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.829
You can't let go and
you can't hold on.


34
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.082
You can't go back and
you can't stand still.


35
00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:19.045
If the thunder don't get you
then the lightning...


36
00:06:49.116 --> 00:06:52.285
Back to back,

37
00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:55.497
chicken shack.

38
00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.291
Son of a gun,

39
00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:02.128
better change your act.

40
00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:05.674
We're all confused.

41
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.426
What's to lose?

42
00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:11.221
You can call this song

43
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.683
"The United States Blues."

44
00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:22.732
Wave that flag,

45
00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:26.028
wave it wide and high.

46
00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:35.954
Summertime done,

47
00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.125
come and gone, my oh my.

48
00:07:44.588 --> 00:07:47.424
I'm Uncle Sam,

49
00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.427
that's who I am.

50
00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:54.222
Been hiding out

51
00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:56.142
in a rock and roll band.

52
00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:01.396
Shake the hand

53
00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:04.357
that shook the hand

54
00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:07.694
Of P.T. Barnum

55
00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:09.322
and Charlie Chan.

56
00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:18.955
Wave that flag,

57
00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:22.043
wave it wide and high.

58
00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:31.968
Summertime done,

59
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:34.930
come and gone, my oh my.

60
00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:16.805
Back to back,

61
00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.266
chicken shack.

62
00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:22.685
Son of a gun,

63
00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:24.480
better change your act.

64
00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:28.067
We're all confused.

65
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.404
What's to lose?

66
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.907
You can call this song

67
00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.868
"The United States Blues."

68
00:09:43.707 --> 00:09:47.085
Wave that flag,

69
00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:50.214
wave it wide and high.

70
00:09:56.804 --> 00:10:00.014
Summertime done,

71
00:10:00.015 --> 00:10:03.644
come and gone, my oh my.

72
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.486
Summertime done,

73
00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:17.073
come and gone, my oh my.

74
00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:19.868
My oh my, my my my.

75
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.745
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

76
00:10:22.746 --> 00:10:25.915
Summertime done,

77
00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:29.253
Come and gone, my oh my.

78
00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:35.151
I went down to the mountain,
I was drinking some wine.


79
00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:38.154
I looked up into heaven,
Lord, I saw a mighty sign.


80
00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:40.865
Writ in fire across the heaven,
plain as black and white.


81
00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:44.536
Get prepared, there's gonna
be a party tonight, uh huh huh.


82
00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.249
Hey, Saturday night.

83
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:52.210
Well, uh-huh,

84
00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.088
one more Saturday night.

85
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.757
Saturday night.

86
00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:05.515
Everybody's dancing down
the local skating rink


87
00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:08.518
with a basement full of dynamite
and live artillery.


88
00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.354
Temperature keeps rising,
everybody getting high.


89
00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:14.984
Come the rocking strike of midnight,
the whole place is gonna fly, uh huh.


90
00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:18.487
Saturday night.

91
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.532
Well, uh-huh,

92
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.410
one more Saturday night.

93
00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:27.288
Saturday night.

94
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.992
I turn on Channel Six,
the President comes on the news,


95
00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:09.120
says I get no satisfaction,
that's why I sing the blues.


96
00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:12.332
His wife says don't get crazy,
Lord you know what to do.


97
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:15.628
Crank up that old Victrola,
break out your rocking shoes, uh huh.


98
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.881
Hey, Saturday night.

99
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.384
Well, uh-huh,

100
00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.511
one more Saturday night.

101
00:13:25.512 --> 00:13:27.890
Saturday night.

102
00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:36.189
Then God way up in heaven,
for whatever it was worth,


103
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.734
thought he'd have a big old party,
thought he'd call it planet earth.


104
00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:42.779
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord,
You'll know it when it comes.


105
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.991
When the rocking, rolling music
meets the rising, shining sun, uh-huh.


106
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.328
Hey, Saturday night.

107
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.623
Well, uh-huh,

108
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.668
One more Saturday night.

109
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.462
Saturday night.

110
00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:03.676
Easy now!

111
00:14:53.809 --> 00:15:00.106
- Hey, another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)


112
00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:02.775
- You can party, get right.
- (one more Saturday night)


113
00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:06.112
- Hey, another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)


114
00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:09.575
One more Saturday,
one more Saturday night.


115
00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:15.121
- Hey, another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night!)


116
00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:17.082
Hey, on a Saturday night.

117
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:21.794
- Hey! Hey, yeah!
- (one more Saturday night)


118
00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:24.630
- Another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)


119
00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:27.926
One more Saturday,
one more Saturday night.


120
00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:37.101
- Hey, another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)


121
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:40.021
- Hey, yeah!
- (one more Saturday night)


122
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:43.024
- Another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)


123
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:47.487
One more Saturday,
one more, Saturday night.


124
00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.072
Hey, yeah, yeah!

125
00:15:50.073 --> 00:15:53.869
Yeah, yeah!

126
00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.389
And the camera roll.

127
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.559
- Anybody else?
- Hold it.


128
00:16:20.103 --> 00:16:22.188
It's too late.
We'll get it together later on.


129
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:24.565
Just a moment we'd like to do
something that's never been done before


130
00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:28.194
because there are men, for years and
years, who've worked with the Dead,


131
00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:29.487
who've made it always possible,

132
00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.280
getting all this equipment up.

133
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:33.241
For once, let's really get them up.

134
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:36.327
They're shy, we're very, very crazy...
the Grateful Dead crew.


135
00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.204
Will you all come out here, please?
Come on!


136
00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:42.667
Ram Rod, Steve,
get your asses out here, come on.


137
00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:46.420
Healy, Jackson, Joseph...
Let's go, everybody.


138
00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:47.505
Get 'em all out here.

139
00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:51.008
Here's the man, right there...
Ram Rod, right on!


140
00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:52.427
Come on, Sparky.

141
00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:02.311
Here he is, one of the best guys
in the business, Bill Graham!


142
00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:05.606
Billy, this is the proof.
For ten fuckin' years, they've done it.


143
00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:07.150
Really, once again, for the crew.

144
00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:13.698
Thank you very much.

145
00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.284
You're a damned good audience!

146
00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:23.143
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

147
00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:27.940
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

148
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.821
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)


149
00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.991
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

150
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:43.538
Going where the water tastes like wine.

151
00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.627
Going where the water tastes like wine.

152
00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.715
Going where the water tastes like wine.

153
00:18:55.842 --> 00:18:58.845
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

154
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.267
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

155
00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:09.314
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

156
00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:17.154
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)


157
00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:19.825
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

158
00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:39.594
Sling comin' down!

159
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:44.098
Goin' up!

160
00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:49.813
I got your professional name
all straightened out... Rego Park.


161
00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:53.816
We're all getting paid here, you too!

162
00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:54.818
Hey, Rego!

163
00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:58.822
Oh, Bill, I've been fired!

164
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:07.039
Going where the climate
suits my clothes.


165
00:20:09.624 --> 00:20:12.502
Going where the climate
suits my clothes.


166
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.051
Going where the climate
suits my clothes.


167
00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:22.888
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

168
00:20:25.432 --> 00:20:28.351
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

169
00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:33.731
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

170
00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.025
You ready?

171
00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:41.447
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)


172
00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:44.158
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

173
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.910
Hey, Bill!

174
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.914
Something might fall on you, Bill.
That's a warning, as a friend.


175
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.875
Sling comin' down!

176
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:57.881
I've got a plane to catch!

177
00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:01.517
I've got a plane to catch.
What was your name?


178
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.358
Hey, Healy, you up there?

179
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.239
Okay. One, two, three!

180
00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:24.825
Watch that, guys!

181
00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:45.052
Okay.

182
00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:54.354
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

183
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.609
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

184
00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:07.408
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)


185
00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:10.287
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

186
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:15.876
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

187
00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:20.797
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

188
00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:29.221
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)


189
00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:31.850
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

190
00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:37.397
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

191
00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:42.694
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

192
00:22:45.238 --> 00:22:49.492
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)


193
00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:53.622
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

194
00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:59.044
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

195
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:04.466
Goin' down the road feeling bad.

196
00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:11.847
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)


197
00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:16.102
Don't wanna be treated this a way.

198
00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.189
I guess we should go to Benny.

199
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.901
I know. And then there's the main guy in
regards to covering that whole front there.


200
00:25:28.902 --> 00:25:31.528
That's gonna be something that we're
gonna have to clear through him.


201
00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:35.240
I think it might be better if
you dart around behind all the stuff.


202
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:38.118
That's pretty hard.
There ain't that many holes, you know.


203
00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:42.206
Well, I know but that's...
That's how few there are.


204
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:44.333
Try to get 'em over the top.

205
00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:46.251
Think about it.

206
00:25:46.252 --> 00:25:48.796
'Cause that would be the hippest.

207
00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:51.256
- Then, you'd have the...
- But the scrim is so high.


208
00:25:51.257 --> 00:25:53.217
Hey, man, I know,
but you'll just have to get stuff


209
00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:56.345
to happen down here in the middle
somewhere, by timing it.


210
00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:58.931
That means it can only
be that stuff I throw.


211
00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:01.893
I can't set 'em up spray
planes, I can't...


212
00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:10.109
It's not your decision to make.

213
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.277
It's not my decision, either.

214
00:26:12.278 --> 00:26:15.447
- Is Bill Graham here?
- He'll be here at 5:00.


215
00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:16.657
It's not so much you guys,

216
00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:20.369
it's the people that you guys have had
confrontations with during the years.


217
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.955
They see someone in here with colors on
and they remember the time


218
00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:25.958
maybe he got stomped by seven Angels
and goes fuckin' berserk.


219
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:27.793
I mean, I've seen it
happen a dozen times.


220
00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:28.877
A thousand...

221
00:26:28.878 --> 00:26:30.963
Oh, you know what?
Sandy's flying out here from New York,


222
00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:33.799
and I know he's not
taking his patch off,


223
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.136
so he's coming a long way for nothing.

224
00:26:39.055 --> 00:26:41.348
I say if Bill Graham
thinks I'm that violent,


225
00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:43.143
I ought to just
knock him out and leave.

226
00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:46.521
You know, give him his satisfaction.

227
00:26:48.022 --> 00:26:49.523
Hold it now. Stopping!

228
00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:52.317
What was it the sound system, or what?

229
00:26:52.318 --> 00:26:55.571
Some of the Grateful Dead albums
I worked on...


230
00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:59.492
I was a co engineer on several
of their early albums.


231
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:04.121
You don't engineer no more, or what?

232
00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:06.331
I've been...
The last couple of albums,


233
00:27:06.332 --> 00:27:07.958
I've been going to the pressing plants

234
00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:11.128
and overseeing the
actual record pressings


235
00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:16.925
to make sure the final product
is high quality,


236
00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:19.928
but not actually working on the albums.

237
00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:22.764
Now, I have my hands full.

238
00:27:22.765 --> 00:27:26.018
Burned to the ground,
but resurrected from the ashes.


239
00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:27.769
We're always working
on the piano tuning.


240
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.730
What is it about this guitar
that makes it so...


241
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.107
Like most basses or guitars
that you hear


242
00:27:32.108 --> 00:27:34.526
have one or two good tones on them.

243
00:27:34.527 --> 00:27:36.445
This bass has many, many good tones

244
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:38.614
and can simulate the sound
of other basses.


245
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:41.200
It has lots of different filters on it,

246
00:27:41.201 --> 00:27:44.828
that capability of switching
from one kind of sound


247
00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:47.414
like the same sound coming
from all those speakers


248
00:27:47.415 --> 00:27:51.586
to one string coming from each of
half of one of these stacks.


249
00:27:53.087 --> 00:27:55.923
So in other words,
each string from four different sets,


250
00:27:55.924 --> 00:27:59.051
so it bounces around depending
on how I play it.


251
00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:00.469
I'm talking to you like you're a person,

252
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.515
because you look like a person,
even with that camera on.


253
00:28:34.087 --> 00:28:35.567
Getting a little carried away, there.

254
00:28:59.195 --> 00:29:00.988
I'm not trying to do that on purpose.

255
00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:02.739
The camera!

256
00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.951
Yeah, bring it back,
bring it back, bring it back.


257
00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:08.079
Come on, come on, come on.

258
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.190
- We can play together.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah.


259
00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:51.705
Truckin', got my chips cashed in.

260
00:29:51.706 --> 00:29:55.751
Keep truckin' like the doodah man.

261
00:29:55.752 --> 00:29:59.212
Together, more or less in line.

262
00:29:59.213 --> 00:30:03.468
Just keep truckin' on.

263
00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:13.435
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees
out on Main Street.


264
00:30:13.436 --> 00:30:16.897
Chicago, New York, Detroit,
and it's all the same street.


265
00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:20.817
Your typical city involved in
a typical daydream.


266
00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:24.112
Hang it up and see what
tomorrow brings.


267
00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:27.741
Dallas got a soft machine.

268
00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:31.203
Houston, too close to New Orleans.

269
00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:34.748
New York got the ways and means

270
00:30:34.749 --> 00:30:39.045
- but just won't let you be.
- (no, no, no)


271
00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:48.887
Most of the cats that you meet
on the street speak of true love.


272
00:30:48.888 --> 00:30:52.307
Most of the time they're sitting
and crying at home.


273
00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:55.894
One of these days they know
they better get going


274
00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:59.481
out of the door and down
in the street all alone.


275
00:30:59.482 --> 00:31:02.859
Truckin' like the doodah man.

276
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.196
Once told me,
"You gotta play your hand.


277
00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:10.242
"Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime

278
00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:14.247
if you don't lay 'em down."

279
00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:24.215
Sometimes the lights all shining on me.

280
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:30.722
Other times I can barely see.

281
00:31:33.808 --> 00:31:37.729
Lately it occurs to me...

282
00:31:39.647 --> 00:31:44.068
What a long strange trip it's been.

283
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:54.161
What in the world ever
became of sweet Jane?


284
00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:57.581
She lost her sparkle you know
she isn't the same.


285
00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:01.168
Living on reds and vitamin C
and cocaine.


286
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:04.838
All her friends can say is,
"Ain't it a shame?"


287
00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:07.716
Truckin' off to Buffalo.

288
00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:11.636
I been thinking you got to mellow slow.

289
00:32:11.637 --> 00:32:15.474
It takes time.
You pick a place to go.


290
00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:19.227
Just keep truckin' on.

291
00:32:19.228 --> 00:32:21.313
Yeah, our happy home.

292
00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:23.523
This is our mailing address.

293
00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:24.358
That's it.

294
00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.651
- That's where I live.
- Five days.


295
00:32:26.652 --> 00:32:29.362
Sitting and staring out
of the hotel window.


296
00:32:29.363 --> 00:32:32.657
Got a tip they're gonna kick
the door in again.


297
00:32:32.658 --> 00:32:36.161
Well, I'd like to get some sleep
before I travel.


298
00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:39.665
But if you got a warrant,
I guess you're gonna come in.


299
00:32:39.832 --> 00:32:43.585
Busted down on Bourbon Street,

300
00:32:43.586 --> 00:32:46.922
set up like a bowling pin.

301
00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:50.300
Knocked down,
it gets to wearing thin.


302
00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:54.722
- They just won't let you be.
- (no, no, no)


303
00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:04.606
You're sick of hanging around
and you'd like to travel.


304
00:33:04.607 --> 00:33:06.818
Get tired of traveling,
you want to settle down.


305
00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:11.613
Well, I guess they can't revoke
your soul for trying.


306
00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:15.242
Get out of the door,
light out and look all around.


307
00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:18.329
Sometimes the lights all shining on me.

308
00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.872
All right!

309
00:33:21.707 --> 00:33:25.210
Other times I can barely see.

310
00:33:25.211 --> 00:33:26.878
What's that, Greg?

311
00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:28.004
Chiclets.

312
00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:31.843
Lately it occurs to me...

313
00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:38.391
What a long strange trip it's been.

314
00:33:44.772 --> 00:33:48.817
Truckin', I'm a going home,

315
00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:52.529
whoa, whoa, baby,
back where I belong,


316
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.032
Back home,
sit down and patch my bones,


317
00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:59.954
and get back truckin' on.

318
00:34:02.498 --> 00:34:04.082
I would say we're pretty nuts.

319
00:34:04.083 --> 00:34:06.042
What's it, three in the afternoon
or something?


320
00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:07.794
About three in the afternoon,
the sidewalk,


321
00:34:07.795 --> 00:34:09.671
there'd be some cop runnin'
up and down here saying,


322
00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:11.214
"Stay back to this line," you know.

323
00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:14.718
And people just sitting down,
gettin' stoned, snortin' coke.


324
00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.721
All week long, people are
gonna be crazy out here.


325
00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:19.389
How long have you guys
been out here?


326
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:22.642
What'd we get here,

327
00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:24.102
- Where's your mother?
- My mother?


328
00:34:24.103 --> 00:34:26.563
- She's probably at work right now...
- Whereabouts?


329
00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:29.149
...worryin' about me
being in line all day.


330
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.192
She works in Oakland.
She's a good mother.


331
00:34:31.193 --> 00:34:32.485
How many people are tryin' to get in?

332
00:34:32.486 --> 00:34:34.112
About seven... at least seven of us.

333
00:34:34.113 --> 00:34:35.280
How many more do we need?

334
00:34:35.281 --> 00:34:37.741
I don't know, we need lots,
'Cause there's always more that pop up.


335
00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.743
- I just got one, though.
- I just got one, too.


336
00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:40.744
Great.

337
00:34:43.497 --> 00:34:45.166
Rock and roll!

338
00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:04.435
Grateful Dead! Right on!

339
00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:09.898
Have your tickets out and ready!

340
00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:13.526
Have your tickets out and ready!
Have your tickets out and ready!


341
00:35:13.527 --> 00:35:15.487
Have your tickets out and ready!

342
00:35:15.488 --> 00:35:17.906
You can't carry it in.

343
00:35:17.907 --> 00:35:21.034
Have your ticket out and ready, please!
Have your ticket ready.


344
00:35:21.035 --> 00:35:22.202
There are two doors.

345
00:35:22.203 --> 00:35:23.912
You can't carry that pack in.

346
00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:25.914
I'm sorry, sir.
Thank you very kindly.


347
00:35:25.915 --> 00:35:28.834
March right in and
have a good time!


348
00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:33.546
Have 'em out and ready, please.
Have your ticket out and ready.


349
00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:34.788
Have your ticket out and ready.

350
00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:39.637
Have your tickets out and ready.

351
00:35:45.142 --> 00:35:47.269
Have your tickets out and ready, please.

352
00:36:14.171 --> 00:36:16.047
You just wait, man.

353
00:36:16.048 --> 00:36:18.300
They promised that they
would play tonight.


354
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:22.512
Shit, man.

355
00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.973
Grateful Dead! Yeah!

356
00:36:24.974 --> 00:36:26.099
Tell me about the Dead.

357
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.894
The Dead, man,
gets to be the best band.


358
00:36:29.895 --> 00:36:31.104
No doubt about it, man.

359
00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:34.983
Wherever the Dead are,
you see the people, you know?


360
00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:36.443
- Huh?
- What makes 'em the best?


361
00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:40.196
Their sound system, man.
Their music and Jerry Garcia.


362
00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:41.322
He's got it together, man.

363
00:36:41.323 --> 00:36:42.991
They've been together
for the last ten years.


364
00:36:42.992 --> 00:36:46.077
They've been together longer than
almost any group I know of.


365
00:36:46.078 --> 00:36:47.662
You know, they've got it, man.

366
00:36:47.663 --> 00:36:48.788
They're the best.

367
00:36:48.789 --> 00:36:50.999
- They're the best.
- Besides Jesus.


368
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.376
- What's that?
- Acid, yeah.


369
00:36:53.627 --> 00:36:58.006
I'm caught here
I'm going to try to get in.


370
00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:59.966
You know, the Grateful Dead.

371
00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:01.176
Sure, I have a ticket.
Wanna see it?


372
00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:02.136
Well, you can't stand right there

373
00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:04.846
I know. I'm just trying to
get my space together


374
00:37:04.847 --> 00:37:07.182
so that I can go into the show.

375
00:37:07.183 --> 00:37:09.435
I just came from a phone call.

376
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:49.642
Fantastic!

377
00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:21.924
Oh, Donna Jean!

378
00:39:29.408 --> 00:39:34.288
Right outside this lazy summer home.

379
00:39:38.417 --> 00:39:43.422
You ain't got time to call
your soul a critic, no.


380
00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:52.472
Right outside the lazy gate...

381
00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:56.935
of winter's summer home...

382
00:39:56.936 --> 00:40:02.107
wondering where the nuthatch winters.

383
00:40:02.274 --> 00:40:05.401
Wings a mile long

384
00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:10.908
just carried the bird away.

385
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:20.084
Wake up to find out that you are
the eyes of the world.


386
00:40:23.629 --> 00:40:29.134
But the heart has its beaches,
its homeland and thoughts of its own.


387
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.181
Wake now discover

388
00:40:35.182 --> 00:40:39.645
that you are the song
that the morning brings.


389
00:40:42.064 --> 00:40:47.861
But the heart has its seasons,
its evenings and songs of its own.


390
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:26.543
Sometimes we live
no particular way but our own.


391
00:42:30.297 --> 00:42:35.844
Sometimes we visit your country
and live in your home.


392
00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:43.143
Sometimes we ride on your horses.

393
00:42:44.686 --> 00:42:47.398
Sometimes we walk alone.

394
00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:54.279
Sometimes the songs that we hear
are just songs of our own.


395
00:42:58.158 --> 00:43:03.622
Wake up to find out that
you are the eyes of the world.


396
00:43:06.875 --> 00:43:12.589
The heart has its beaches,
its homeland and thoughts of its own.


397
00:43:16.468 --> 00:43:18.636
Wake now discover

398
00:43:18.637 --> 00:43:23.058
that you are the song
that the morning brings.


399
00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:31.442
But the heart has its seasons,
its evenings and songs of its own.


400
00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:00.631
Say something intelligent.

401
00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:04.885
Bottom line of the whole scene
is very simply stated.


402
00:46:04.886 --> 00:46:09.474
There is nothing like
a Grateful Dead concert. Period.


403
00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:11.058
Never will be.

404
00:46:11.059 --> 00:46:14.145
If the Dead were to die,
I'd have reason to cry,


405
00:46:14.146 --> 00:46:17.565
because the band I used to see
would be a cold memory.


406
00:46:17.566 --> 00:46:21.068
But if the Dead were to live,
free concerts they'd give.


407
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:26.031
Jerry G. on guitar would bring 'em in
from near and far.


408
00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:29.285
If the Dead were to cease,
there'd be no street peace.


409
00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:33.248
We take hold the power,
skin the cat and take a shower.


410
00:46:33.415 --> 00:46:36.959
But if the Dead live long,
we'll be singing their songs.


411
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.256
We'll all be so glad
Mama hated Diesel so bad.


412
00:46:42.382 --> 00:46:43.842
Grateful Dead!

413
00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.589
This is just fucked up, though.

414
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:13.968
This fuckin' film, man,
making cash off everybody.


415
00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:17.596
This is the biggest pile of shit
I've ever seen the Dead ever do.


416
00:50:17.597 --> 00:50:19.139
- You're full of shit!
- Aww, you're nuts, man.


417
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.183
If this film is just...

418
00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.685
Five nights of this show, man.

419
00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:24.603
You can have it filmed one night
and charge more.


420
00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:27.022
- Would you would you listen to me?
- Yeah.


421
00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:30.818
This film is nothing more than
a record album on film.


422
00:50:30.819 --> 00:50:33.195
It kinda gets in the way of
everybody who's here, though.


423
00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:36.741
Four or five years from now, you're gonna
be grateful that this thing was filmed.


424
00:50:36.908 --> 00:50:40.411
You are gonna pay

425
00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:42.288
I don't know if I'll be
alive five years from now!


426
00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:45.207
- Well, neither do I, but if you are alive...
- Well, you're crazy as shit, man!


427
00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:46.751
...you'll be in that theater,
and I bet you...


428
00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:48.168
- You wanna bet money on it?
- Yeah.


429
00:50:48.169 --> 00:50:49.628
What's your name?
I'll take your address and I'll...


430
00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:51.714
- My name is John Williams.
- John Williams?


431
00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.048
- Yeah.
- Sam Hughes.


432
00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.216
- Hi, Sam.
- Okay, I'll bet you anything


433
00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.509
that I will not be at that movie.

434
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:59.221
It's always good to see
a real Dead Head around...


435
00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:02.057
Yeah, why are you so uptight?
You feel you're being exploited?


436
00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:03.225
- Yes.
- In what way?


437
00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:05.394
Who is going to get royalties?
It's like this if this little thing,


438
00:51:05.395 --> 00:51:07.855
which there's no way
it's gonna be in the movie,


439
00:51:07.856 --> 00:51:10.774
and there were five million people
watching this movie all over the world...


440
00:51:10.775 --> 00:51:14.236
and I was being in the movie right here,
but this is ten minutes of my time...


441
00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.447
Say this was all in the movie,
these people are being charged,


442
00:51:16.448 --> 00:51:18.532
do I get royalties, would I?

443
00:51:18.533 --> 00:51:20.785
No.

444
00:51:20.952 --> 00:51:23.495
St. Stephen!

445
00:51:23.496 --> 00:51:25.665
- Crazy, man!
- You're crazy!


446
00:51:26.958 --> 00:51:29.752
He's crazy because he doesn't realize...

447
00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:32.838
He does not realize...
He's spaced out.


448
00:51:32.839 --> 00:51:34.757
He wants a residual.

449
00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:36.675
I hope this movie comes
true, man, really.


450
00:51:36.676 --> 00:51:38.093
It will! We know it will!

451
00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:40.096
The omnipotent Grateful Dead.

452
00:52:00.575 --> 00:52:03.577
Sugar Magnolia, blossoms blooming.

453
00:52:03.578 --> 00:52:06.914
Head's all empty and I don't care.

454
00:52:06.915 --> 00:52:10.584
Saw my baby down by the river.

455
00:52:10.585 --> 00:52:13.254
I knew she'd have
to come up soon for air.


456
00:52:16.758 --> 00:52:19.843
Sweet blossom come on under the willow.

457
00:52:19.844 --> 00:52:23.180
We can have high times if you'll abide.

458
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:26.266
We can discover the wonders of nature...

459
00:52:26.267 --> 00:52:29.729
rolling in the rushes
down by the riverside.


460
00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:35.859
She's got everything delightful.

461
00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:39.363
She's got everything I need.

462
00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:42.783
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double.

463
00:52:42.784 --> 00:52:45.996
Pays my ticket when I speed.

464
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:08.767
She comes skimming
through rays of violet.


465
00:53:08.768 --> 00:53:11.854
She can wade in a drop of dew.

466
00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:14.857
She don't come and I don't follow.

467
00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:18.028
Waits backstage while I sing to you.

468
00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.366
She can dance a Cajun rhythm.

469
00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:27.870
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive.

470
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:30.915
She's my summer love in
the spring, fall and winter.


471
00:53:31.082 --> 00:53:34.044
She can make happy any man alive.

472
00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:38.757
Sugar Magnolia.

473
00:53:40.633 --> 00:53:42.218
Ringin' that blue bell.

474
00:53:43.762 --> 00:53:45.722
Caught up in sunlight.

475
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:51.268
Yeah, come on out singing,
I'll walk you in the sunshine.


476
00:53:51.269 --> 00:53:53.313
Come on honey,
come home with me.


477
00:53:55.982 --> 00:53:58.985
She's got everything delightful.

478
00:53:59.152 --> 00:54:02.529
She's got everything I need.

479
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:05.866
A breeze in the pines in
the summer night moonlight.


480
00:54:05.867 --> 00:54:09.204
Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed.

481
00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:15.918
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying,

482
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.963
When the moon is halfway down,

483
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:22.216
sometimes when the night is dying,

484
00:54:22.217 --> 00:54:28.013
I take me out and I wander around.

485
00:54:28.014 --> 00:54:29.557
I walk around.

486
00:57:02.293 --> 00:57:04.045
Sunshine daydream.

487
00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:07.298
Walk you in the tall trees.

488
00:57:08.716 --> 00:57:10.551
Going where the wind goes.

489
00:57:12.845 --> 00:57:14.764
Blooming like a red rose.

490
00:57:16.015 --> 00:57:17.850
Come on over sweetly.

491
00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:20.727
Light out singing

492
00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:22.772
I'll walk you in the morning sunshine

493
00:57:24.482 --> 00:57:26.276
Sunshine daydream.

494
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:30.570
Sunshine daydream.

495
00:57:30.571 --> 00:57:32.407
Well, come on, come on over daydream.

496
00:57:33.866 --> 00:57:35.535
Sunshine daydream.

497
00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:38.579
Come on, come on from a sweet dream.

498
00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.666
Sunshine daydream.

499
00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.877
Wading in a cold stream.

500
00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:47.880
Goin' out your window.

501
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.968
Goin', goin' where the wind goes.

502
00:57:53.094 --> 00:57:54.887
They're never going to miss us.

503
00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:57.764
Light out singing.

504
00:57:57.765 --> 00:58:00.310
I got you in the morning sunshine.

505
00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:03.313
Sunshine daydream.

506
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:06.357
Sunshine daydream.

507
00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:12.447
Sunshine daydream.

508
00:58:16.951 --> 00:58:18.453
Sunshine daydream.

509
00:58:19.954 --> 00:58:21.914
Come on, come on over daydream.

510
00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.667
Sunshine daydream

511
00:58:25.793 --> 00:58:29.129
- Come on, come on from a sweet dream.
- (come on from a sweet dream)


512
00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:30.798
Sunshine daydream.

513
00:58:35.136 --> 00:58:37.013
Sunshine daydream.

514
00:58:41.267 --> 00:58:43.102
Sunshine daydream.

515
00:58:44.479 --> 00:58:47.481
- Come on, come on.
- (hey yeah, yeah)


516
00:58:47.482 --> 00:58:50.150
Sunshine daydream.

517
00:58:50.151 --> 00:58:53.612
- Well, come on Sweet Magnolia daydream.
- (comin' from a sweet dream)


518
00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:56.240
Sunshine daydream.

519
00:58:56.407 --> 00:58:58.284
When I dream of a daydream.

520
00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.661
Sunshine daydream.

521
00:59:01.662 --> 00:59:05.916
- Come on, come on, come on over daydream
- (comin' from a sweet dream, yeah)


522
00:59:05.917 --> 00:59:08.460
- Sunshine daydream
- (dream)


523
00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:11.922
- Yeah!
- (yeah)


524
00:59:11.923 --> 00:59:14.759
Sunshine daydream.

525
00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:20.764
Sunshine daydream.

526
00:59:20.765 --> 00:59:24.267
- Lord, come on over daydream!
- (yeah, yeah)


527
00:59:24.268 --> 00:59:26.187
Sunshine daydream.

528
00:59:32.276 --> 00:59:34.153
Sweet Magnolia daydream.

529
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:45.039
(sweet daydream)

530
00:59:55.883 --> 00:59:57.343
Thank you all, goodnight!

531
01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:28.331
- Really?
- Yeah.


532
01:00:28.332 --> 01:00:31.209
- Oh, that's nice.
- You're not kidding.


533
01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:34.004
It's always this...
a group of the same faces, basically.


534
01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:37.174
And then, there's new people keep
coming in over the years,


535
01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:40.010
and then older people
phase off, you know,


536
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:44.306
advance on to different trips and
you don't see their faces as much.


537
01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.726
But it's like a continuous trip.

538
01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.190
The first concert I went to was
the Dead at Fillmore with...


539
01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:56.735
It was on a Sunday afternoon
at 1:00 or so, I don't know,


540
01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:59.196
when they used to play
afternoons at Fillmore


541
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:02.908
with the Airplane and Big Brother,
and that used to be really big.


542
01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:05.202
I mean, you never get to see
those three at once.


543
01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.954
- They used to do it every weekend.
- Really.


544
01:01:07.955 --> 01:01:11.167
See the Dead out at the Panhandle
and Golden Gate Park.


545
01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:15.087
But those were the old days.

546
01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:55.395
If my words did glow

547
01:02:55.396 --> 01:02:59.899
with the gold of sunshine...

548
01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.111
and my tunes were played

549
01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:06.531
on the harp unstrung,

550
01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:10.452
would you hear my voice...

551
01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:13.623
come through the music?

552
01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:19.419
Would you hold it near,

553
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.671
as it were your own?

554
01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:23.716
It's a hand me down.

555
01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:28.679
The thoughts are broken.

556
01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:34.267
Perhaps they're better...

557
01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:37.604
left unsung.

558
01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:38.981
I don't know.

559
01:03:40.941 --> 01:03:43.861
Don't really care.

560
01:03:45.863 --> 01:03:49.366
Let there be songs...

561
01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:52.786
to fill the air.

562
01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:55.497
When did you first start
going to the concerts?


563
01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.249
I guess about 1967 in New York.

564
01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.795
I remember in the Fillmore
and Hartford, Connecticut,


565
01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:05.965
and L.A. and Charlotte, North Carolina,
and Philadelphia,


566
01:04:05.966 --> 01:04:08.427
and just a whole bunch of places.

567
01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:13.556
And all when all the acid things
were going on,


568
01:04:13.557 --> 01:04:16.017
all the heavy kind of
generational changes


569
01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:19.854
and everything that was
happening in the country,


570
01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:22.732
they seemed to really
be reflecting that,


571
01:04:22.733 --> 01:04:24.567
and so was I.

572
01:04:24.568 --> 01:04:26.612
And so, it just really
meant a lot to me.


573
01:04:30.991 --> 01:04:34.077
See that girl bare-footing along?

574
01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:36.996
Whistling and singing,
she's a carrying on.


575
01:04:36.997 --> 01:04:40.041
Got laughing in her eyes,
dancing in her feet.


576
01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.168
She's a neon light diamond.

577
01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:43.503
She can live on the street.

578
01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:47.006
Hey, hey, come right away.

579
01:04:47.007 --> 01:04:50.677
Come and join the party every day.

580
01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:53.471
Hey, hey, come right away.

581
01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:56.975
Come and join the party every day.

582
01:04:56.976 --> 01:05:00.145
Well, everybody's dancing
in a ring around the sun.


583
01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:03.440
Nobody's finished,
we ain't even begun.


584
01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:05.066
So take off your shoes, child,

585
01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.860
and take off your hat.

586
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:09.613
Try on your wings
and find out where it's at.


587
01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.991
Hey, hey, come right away.

588
01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:16.369
Come and join the party every day.

589
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:19.623
Hey, hey, come right away.

590
01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:24.462
Come and join the party every day.

591
01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:46.065
Take a vacation,
fall out for a while.


592
01:05:46.066 --> 01:05:49.027
Summer's coming in,
winter's going out in style.


593
01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:51.529
Well, lie down smoking, honey.

594
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:54.199
Have yourself a ball,
'cause your mother's down in Memphis.


595
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.867
Won't be back till the fall.

596
01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:58.912
Hey, hey, come right away.

597
01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:02.290
Come and join the party every day.

598
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:05.752
Hey, hey, come right away.

599
01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:08.839
Come and join the party every day.

600
01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:19.492
Some folks look for answers,

601
01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:21.828
others look for fights.

602
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.289
Some folks up in the treetops

603
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.708
just a looking for their kites.

604
01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.043
But I can tell your future.

605
01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:31.671
Whoa, just look what's in your hand.

606
01:07:31.672 --> 01:07:33.047
But I can't stop for nothing.

607
01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:36.426
I'm just playing in the band.

608
01:07:36.427 --> 01:07:38.678
Playing.

609
01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:41.306
Playing in the band.

610
01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.683
Daybreak.

611
01:07:43.684 --> 01:07:45.477
Daybreak on the land.

612
01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.707
Some folks look for answers,

613
01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:10.043
others look for fights.

614
01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.545
Some folks up in the treetops

615
01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:14.798
just looking for their kites.

616
01:08:14.965 --> 01:08:17.300
Well, I can tell your future.

617
01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.844
Whoa, just look what's in your hand.

618
01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.471
But I can't stop for nothing.

619
01:08:21.472 --> 01:08:24.724
I'm just playing in the band.

620
01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:26.810
Playing.

621
01:08:26.977 --> 01:08:29.729
Playing in the band.

622
01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:31.773
Daybreak.

623
01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.651
Daybreak on the land.

624
01:09:03.681 --> 01:09:06.057
Standing on a tower,

625
01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:08.768
world at my command.

626
01:09:08.769 --> 01:09:13.439
You just keep turning
while I'm playing in the band.


627
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.775
And if a man among you

628
01:09:15.776 --> 01:09:18.653
got no sin upon his hand,

629
01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.780
let him cast a stone at me

630
01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:23.533
for playing in the band.

631
01:09:23.534 --> 01:09:25.493
Playing.

632
01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:28.204
Playing in the band.

633
01:09:28.205 --> 01:09:30.415
Daybreak.

634
01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.334
Daybreak on the land.

635
01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:35.826
There's no relationship that
I've ever been able to hear on tapes


636
01:13:35.827 --> 01:13:37.995
between the way I feel

637
01:13:37.996 --> 01:13:41.540
and the way it went down,
you know what I mean?


638
01:13:41.541 --> 01:13:43.459
Doesn't matter how I feel.

639
01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:44.543
- It doesn't?
- No.


640
01:13:44.544 --> 01:13:46.545
I haven't been able to hear it matter.

641
01:13:46.546 --> 01:13:48.714
It matters how I feel to me,
of course, 'cause that...


642
01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:50.549
You know, I feel that way, you know.

643
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:51.926
I come off the stage, boy,

644
01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:55.138
sometimes really,
really upset, you know.


645
01:13:55.305 --> 01:13:57.014
And when I was younger,
I would get even more upset


646
01:13:57.015 --> 01:13:58.182
I'd get more crazy.

647
01:13:58.183 --> 01:14:00.142
I would want it to be
really good, you know,


648
01:14:00.143 --> 01:14:03.562
and I'd think, wow,
it's not where it should be.


649
01:14:03.563 --> 01:14:05.815
It's almost there, but it's not there.
And then I'd get really angry.


650
01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:08.776
I remember one time, we were...
we did the Carousel, and we recorded.


651
01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:12.655
I got really upset at
the end of the set,


652
01:14:12.656 --> 01:14:15.241
'cause I thought it was
just horrible for some reason.


653
01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:18.160
It seemed like everything
was a struggle.


654
01:14:18.161 --> 01:14:23.165
And I got real pissed off at Phil
and I grabbed him


655
01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:24.959
and threw him down this
little flight of stairs.


656
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.044
You know, it's like, man,
I've never done that.


657
01:14:27.045 --> 01:14:30.173
And Phil... I've been really tight
with him for years.


658
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.216
I was that freaked out, you know,

659
01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:34.593
and high, too, you know,
flipped out, man.


660
01:14:34.594 --> 01:14:36.387
Music was fucked, you know.

661
01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:38.681
And then we listened
to these tapes months later


662
01:14:38.682 --> 01:14:40.850
and ended up using 'em
on our album, man


663
01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.352
They were... You know, they were...

664
01:14:43.353 --> 01:14:45.062
You know, they were
crackling with energy.


665
01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:47.606
They were amazing,
but that's when I knew,


666
01:14:47.607 --> 01:14:50.693
well, fuck, I've just got to learn
to keep my mouth shut, you know,


667
01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:52.903
and just not even think about whether...

668
01:14:52.904 --> 01:14:55.991
whether it seemed like
it was happening to me or not.


669
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.575
He's very creative, but you kind of have
to kick his ass every now and again.


670
01:17:44.534 --> 01:17:47.786
I have found that,
generally speaking,


671
01:17:47.787 --> 01:17:50.290
I create best when somebody
holds a gun to my head.


672
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.586
I use a telephone to call him up
and ask him


673
01:17:55.587 --> 01:17:57.380
if he's written any music
so I can write some words,


674
01:17:57.547 --> 01:18:03.260
'cause I've given up on trying to write
words and have him write music later.


675
01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:06.264
- And I like it that way.
- Yeah. Gives him the upper hand.


676
01:18:08.141 --> 01:18:11.393
I call myself a
four-sided schizophrenic,


677
01:18:11.394 --> 01:18:14.146
because you have to have four
separate ideas going,


678
01:18:14.147 --> 01:18:16.315
all right, and then a single thing here.

679
01:18:16.316 --> 01:18:19.068
It's more than patting your head,
rubbing your stomach,


680
01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:20.903
because you're doing
it with four things.


681
01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:25.282
And that sort of relates as to
why when you get that down in music,


682
01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:28.827
in drumming, particularly,
then you get so you can be dancing,


683
01:18:28.828 --> 01:18:30.412
and that is really fine,

684
01:18:30.413 --> 01:18:33.374
'cause you sit back there and
it feels just like you're dancing.


685
01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.669
You're playing and the groove
is just right and the kicks aren't made


686
01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:38.754
the accents and the rolls,

687
01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:42.383
they're not made,
they're just into the flow.


688
01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.302
And that's the kind of music I like.

689
01:23:31.297 --> 01:23:33.549
Playing.

690
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.009
Playing in the band.

691
01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.011
Daybreak.

692
01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:40.681
Daybreak on the la

693
01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.808
Playing.

694
01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:45.435
Playing in the band.

695
01:23:45.436 --> 01:23:47.604
Daybreak.

696
01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:50.148
Daybreak on the land.

697
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:52.401
Playing.

698
01:23:52.402 --> 01:23:55.112
Like the wave upon on the sand.

699
01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:57.030
Daybreak.

700
01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:59.909
While I'm playing in the band.

701
01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:37.798
I'm waitin' for Bob, man.

702
01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.549
- So? Bob who?
- Weir.


703
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:42.135
Listen, I'm doing some
electrical work at his house.


704
01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:43.553
What's your name?

705
01:25:43.554 --> 01:25:44.180
Okay, listen.

706
01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:45.847
We're doing work at the house,

707
01:25:45.848 --> 01:25:47.349
I gave him my card,
I'm his chef,


708
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:49.643
he says come on down, give me
the card, you'll get in.


709
01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.937
You're either on the list or you're not.
What's your name?


710
01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:52.814
My name's Levy.

711
01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:54.815
Just give him my card,
he'll say let 'em in.


712
01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:56.900
- Give us your card.
- I gave it to this dude.


713
01:25:56.901 --> 01:25:57.901
I'll take it.

714
01:26:18.089 --> 01:26:19.756
So, now, if you'd come
to that door, there,


715
01:26:19.757 --> 01:26:22.676
and then come out,
then we could've let you back in.


716
01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:24.037
But if you come out the side door,

717
01:26:24.053 --> 01:26:26.722
we have no way of tellin' you
whether you were sick or not.


718
01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:28.056
But how about the fact that I...

719
01:26:28.057 --> 01:26:29.474
You have to come out this door here.

720
01:26:29.475 --> 01:26:31.894
I know but, I'm from New York

721
01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:33.520
I've come 3,000 miles
to see this concert.


722
01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:35.105
Yeah, but darlin',
you should read the signs.


723
01:26:35.106 --> 01:26:36.857
Can you get Bob Weir for me?

724
01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:39.151
I gave your card,
what more can I do?


725
01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:41.279
Now, hush...
Anyway, get out of here.


726
01:26:43.322 --> 01:26:45.866
I wouldn't come out here to see it

727
01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:47.910
and not, you know,
have a ticket to get in.


728
01:26:48.077 --> 01:26:49.786
I'm not gonna come 3,000 miles...

729
01:26:49.787 --> 01:26:51.246
What's up, miss?

730
01:26:51.247 --> 01:26:52.581
What's the problem?

731
01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:55.083
Well, I came out the side door
because I needed air


732
01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:56.710
and it was cool air,

733
01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:59.504
and I walked around and
now I want to come back in.


734
01:26:59.505 --> 01:27:01.465
I have absolutely
no way of knowing that.


735
01:27:01.466 --> 01:27:02.675
Thanks a lot, love.

736
01:27:04.135 --> 01:27:05.343
You keep it.

737
01:27:05.344 --> 01:27:07.846
- I don't want it.
- All right.


738
01:27:07.847 --> 01:27:09.265
- What's your first name?
- Jeff.


739
01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:16.897
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.


740
01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.066
Thank you.

741
01:27:22.195 --> 01:27:23.946
Well, honey, you told me
you're not walking around...


742
01:27:24.113 --> 01:27:26.031
Do you know a guard or somebody
that saw you walk out,


743
01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:27.991
if he comes here and
tells me that he's seen you inside,


744
01:27:27.992 --> 01:27:29.367
I'll let you back in.

745
01:27:29.368 --> 01:27:31.079
All right, I'll go and look for him.

746
01:27:41.881 --> 01:27:43.174
Tickets only.

747
01:27:46.219 --> 01:27:47.928
Tickets only.

748
01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.596
Ticket, sir?

749
01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:51.431
No.

750
01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:52.934
Sorry, we're all sold out.

751
01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:57.980
When all the cards are down.

752
01:28:04.237 --> 01:28:08.116
There's nothing left to see.

753
01:28:13.704 --> 01:28:18.042
There's just the pavement left.

754
01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:23.172
And broken dreams.

755
01:28:35.184 --> 01:28:38.855
In the end there's still that song.

756
01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:49.240
Comes crying like the wind.

757
01:28:55.204 --> 01:28:59.834
Down every lonely street.

758
01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:04.839
That's ever been.

759
01:29:13.472 --> 01:29:15.266
Stella Blue.

760
01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:26.944
Stella Blue.

761
01:29:35.286 --> 01:29:37.037
I've stayed in

762
01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:41.375
every blue light cheap hotel

763
01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:50.760
Can't win for trying.

764
01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:58.600
Dust off those rusty strings

765
01:29:58.601 --> 01:30:01.771
just one more time.

766
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:10.529
Gonna make them shine.

767
01:31:08.170 --> 01:31:12.341
It all rolls into one.

768
01:31:18.264 --> 01:31:23.311
And nothing comes for free.

769
01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:30.525
There's nothing

770
01:31:30.526 --> 01:31:34.696
you can hold...

771
01:31:34.697 --> 01:31:37.783
for very long.

772
01:31:49.378 --> 01:31:53.549
And when you hear that song.

773
01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:03.893
Crying like the wind.

774
01:32:09.732 --> 01:32:12.108
It seems like

775
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:16.321
all this life...

776
01:32:16.322 --> 01:32:19.116
was just a dream.

777
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:29.877
Stella Blue.

778
01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:40.679
Stella Blue.

779
01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:14.332
Next.

780
01:35:14.333 --> 01:35:17.502
- Yeah, can I get a hot dog?
- Wet hot dog.


781
01:35:17.503 --> 01:35:19.254
- Anything else?
- Yeah, can I...


782
01:35:19.255 --> 01:35:20.713
- Pardon?
- Can I get some mustard on it?


783
01:35:20.714 --> 01:35:23.926
Mustard's right over there, sir.
Sixty cents. Out of ten.


784
01:35:30.182 --> 01:35:32.600
Do you like any particular
group more than another?


785
01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:34.519
- Do you like...
- Sha Na Na.


786
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.062
- What?
- That's my favorite, Sha Na Na.


787
01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:37.480
- Sha Na Na?
- Yeah.


788
01:35:37.481 --> 01:35:39.691
What do you think of the Dead?

789
01:35:39.692 --> 01:35:42.277
I think their music's too loud.
I don't care for loud music.


790
01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:44.280
That's why I like Sha Na Na.

791
01:35:45.155 --> 01:35:46.448
I do.

792
01:35:49.285 --> 01:35:51.453
Drivin' that train

793
01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.247
high on cocaine,

794
01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:56.833
Casey Jones you better

795
01:35:56.834 --> 01:35:59.544
watch your speed.

796
01:35:59.545 --> 01:36:01.838
Trouble ahead,

trouble behind,

798
01:36:04.675 --> 01:36:07.135
and you know that notion

799
01:36:07.136 --> 01:36:10.222
just crossed my mind.

800
01:36:15.394 --> 01:36:17.562
This old engine

801
01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:20.189
makes it on time,

802
01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:22.442
Leaves Central Station

803
01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:25.570
about a quarter to nine,

804
01:36:25.571 --> 01:36:28.406
hits River Junction

805
01:36:28.407 --> 01:36:30.783
at seventeen to.

806
01:36:30.784 --> 01:36:32.577
At a quarter to ten

807
01:36:32.578 --> 01:36:35.955
you know it's traveling again

808
01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.583
Drivin' that train

809
01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:40.377

810
01:36:41.378 --> 01:36:43.755

And you know that notion

815
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:56.727
just crossed my mind.

816
01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:06.737
Margaret Mead should be here.

817
01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:09.906
- Margaret who?
- Margaret Mead, honey.


818
01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:11.699
- What for?
- What do you mean?


819
01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:14.328
This is it. This is what
she always wanted to do.


820
01:37:15.245 --> 01:37:17.914
Really, really, really, fuckin' really!

821
01:37:17.915 --> 01:37:22.543
Really, really, really,
really, really, man, really!


822
01:37:22.544 --> 01:37:25.338
Trouble with you is

823
01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:27.131
the trouble with me.

824
01:37:27.132 --> 01:37:30.343
Got two good eyes

825
01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:33.138
but we still don't see.

826
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:35.181
Come round the bend.

827
01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:38.810
You know it's the end.

828
01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:43.815
The fireman screams
and the engine just gleams


829
01:37:43.816 --> 01:37:46.818
Drivin' that train

889
01:42:00.572 --> 01:42:02.073
What's left of the vineyards?

890
01:42:02.074 --> 01:42:03.366
What do you want,
red, white or green?


891

White.

892

Green?

893
01:42:06.495 --> 01:42:07.996
Green might be interesting.

894
01:42:31.436 --> 01:42:35.065
Suck on it, suck
on it, suck on it.

895
01:50:57.025 --> 01:50:59.443
Walk me out

896
01:50:59.444 --> 01:51:04.156
in the morning dew,

897
01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:05.742
my honey.

898
01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:17.252
Walk me out

899
01:51:17.253 --> 01:51:21.798
in the morning dew

900
01:51:21.799 --> 01:51:23.384

901
01:51:32.602 --> 01:51:35.187
Can't walk you out

902
01:51:35.188 --> 01:51:40.192

903
01:51:40.193 --> 01:51:41.569
my honey.

904
01:51:49.911 --> 01:51:53.205
I can't walk you out

905
01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:57.292

today.

907
01:52:08.638 --> 01:52:11.431
I thought I heard

908
01:52:11.432 --> 01:52:16.520
a baby cry

909
01:52:16.521 --> 01:52:17.981
this morning.

910
01:52:26.656 --> 01:52:29.825
I thought I heard

911
01:52:29.826 --> 01:52:33.996
a baby...

912
01:52:33.997 --> 01:52:35.873
cry today.

913
01:52:45.925 --> 01:52:48.218
Thought I heard

914
01:52:48.219 --> 01:52:52.389
a baby...

915
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:54.892
cry this morning.

916
01:53:04.068 --> 01:53:05.861
You didn't hear

917
01:53:05.862 --> 01:53:10.782
no baby...

918
01:53:10.783 --> 01:53:13.494
cry today.

919
01:53:31.387 --> 01:53:34.014
Where have all

920
01:53:34.015 --> 01:53:38.268
the people gone.

921
01:53:38.269 --> 01:53:39.979
My honey?

922
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:51.365
Where have all

923
01:53:51.366 --> 01:53:56.078
the people gone...

924
01:53:56.079 --> 01:53:58.164
today?

925
01:54:06.631 --> 01:54:12.511
There's no need for you
to be worrying


926
01:54:12.512 --> 01:54:16.224
about all those people.

927
01:54:24.482 --> 01:54:27.025
You never see

928
01:54:27.026 --> 01:54:31.572
those people...

929
01:54:31.739 --> 01:54:34.200
anyway.

930
01:54:41.916 --> 01:54:44.751
I thought I heard

931
01:54:44.752 --> 01:54:48.630
a young man...

932
01:54:48.631 --> 01:54:51.884
mourn this morning

933
01:54:59.684 --> 01:55:02.477
I thought I heard

934
01:55:02.478 --> 01:55:06.690
a young man mourn...

935
01:55:06.691 --> 01:55:08.651
today.

936
01:55:16.784 --> 01:55:19.494
I thought I heard

937
01:55:19.495 --> 01:55:23.123
a young man...

938
01:55:23.124 --> 01:55:26.002
mourn this morning.

939
01:55:34.343 --> 01:55:36.637
I can't walk you out

940
01:55:36.804 --> 01:55:40.557
in the morning...

941
01:55:40.558 --> 01:55:43.770
dew today.

942
01:57:16.988 --> 01:57:19.823
Walk me out

943
01:57:19.824 --> 01:57:23.952
in the morning dew,

944
01:57:23.953 --> 01:57:25.872
my honey.

945
01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:37.215
Walk me out

946
01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:41.720
in the morning dew...

947
01:57:41.721 --> 01:57:43.347
today.

948
01:57:52.565 --> 01:57:55.108
Walk you out

949
01:57:55.109 --> 01:58:00.155
in the morning dew,

950
01:58:00.156 --> 01:58:01.908
my honey.

951
01:58:10.458 --> 01:58:13.501
I guess it doesn't...

952
01:58:13.502 --> 01:58:17.047
matter...

953
01:58:17.048 --> 01:58:22.011
anyway.

954
01:58:28.059 --> 01:58:31.061
I guess it doesn't...

955
01:58:31.062 --> 01:58:35.273
matter...

956
01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:38.945
anyway.

957
02:03:06.337 --> 02:03:09.422
I guess it doesn't...

958
02:03:09.423 --> 02:03:12.592
matter...

959
02:03:12.593 --> 02:03:17.806
anyway.

960
02:03:43.165 --> 02:03:44.582
Thank you.
Thanks a whole lot.


961
02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:47.126
We're gonna change a little bit
of equipment up here


962
02:03:47.127 --> 02:03:50.130
and play some more in a few minutes.

963
02:03:50.297 --> 02:03:51.340
Thank you.

964
02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:07.815
Where the fuck's the water?

965
02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:19.242
Water, just plain, old cold water.

966
02:04:19.243 --> 02:04:20.286
Lots of it.

967
02:04:30.170 --> 02:04:32.464
Where have they taken
my guitar case to?


968
02:04:50.858 --> 02:04:51.900
That's the stuff.

969
02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:09.625
Hey, Barney, look who's here!

970
02:05:09.626 --> 02:05:10.627
I know!

971
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:16.257
I saw her last night
for the first time.


972
02:05:16.258 --> 02:05:19.135
Got some cake?

973
02:05:19.136 --> 02:05:20.888
One more time, anybody?

974
02:05:21.138 --> 02:05:23.974
- One more time?
- One more time?


975
02:05:25.392 --> 02:05:28.603
- What do you want to do?
- Let's decide.


976
02:05:28.604 --> 02:05:32.440
I guarantee you, this way is
the only way you'll get out this door.


977
02:05:32.441 --> 02:05:34.234
Wait a minute, where's the drummer?

978
02:06:02.679 --> 02:06:05.014
Some of you folks might remember
our old drummer,


979
02:06:05.015 --> 02:06:07.434
Mickey Hart,
who's playing with us tonight.


980
02:06:09.436 --> 02:06:12.189
Fresh out of a mental institution,
and a brand new man.


981
02:06:15.692 --> 02:06:18.070
He still has uncontrollable
urges to throw things.


982
02:06:37.005 --> 02:06:39.966
Deep down in Louisiana,
close to New Orleans,


983
02:06:39.967 --> 02:06:43.052
way back up in the woods
among the evergreens,


984
02:06:43.053 --> 02:06:45.847
there is an old cabin
made of earth and wood,


985
02:06:45.848 --> 02:06:49.476
where lived a country boy
named Johnny B. Goode.


986
02:06:49.476 --> 02:06:51.644
He never learned to
read or write so well,


987
02:06:51.645 --> 02:06:54.814
but he could play a guitar
just like ringing a bell.


988
02:06:54.815 --> 02:06:56.607
Go, go!

989
02:06:56.608 --> 02:06:58.735
Go, Johnny, go, go!

990
02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:01.655
Go, Johnny, go, go!

991
02:07:02.781 --> 02:07:04.741
Go, Johnny, go, go!

992
02:07:05.784 --> 02:07:08.619
Go, Johnny, go, go!

993
02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:11.123
Go, Johnny B. Goode.

994
02:07:13.083 --> 02:07:16.627
He used to carry his guitar
in a gunny sack,


995
02:07:16.628 --> 02:07:19.630
go sit up in the trees
by the railroad track.


996
02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:22.675
The engineers seen him
sitting in the shade,


997
02:07:22.676 --> 02:07:26.137
strumming to the rhythm
that the drivers made.


998
02:07:26.138 --> 02:07:28.181
People passing by would
all stop and say


999
02:07:28.182 --> 02:07:31.184
"My but that little
country boy can play!"


1000
02:07:31.185 --> 02:07:33.519
Go, go!

1001
02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.481
Go, Johnny, go, go!

1002
02:07:36.523 --> 02:07:38.484
Go, Johnny, go, go!

1003
02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:41.528
Go, Johnny, go, go!

1004
02:07:42.654 --> 02:07:45.365
Go, Johnny, go, go!

1005
02:07:45.532 --> 02:07:47.784
Go, Johnny B. Goode.

1006
02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:12.141
His papa told him
"Someday you will be a man."


1007
02:08:12.142 --> 02:08:15.186
"You will be the leader
of a big old band."


1008
02:08:15.187 --> 02:08:17.980
"Many people coming
from miles around"


1009
02:08:17.981 --> 02:08:21.108
"will hear you play your music
when the sun goes down."


1010
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:24.111
"Maybe someday
your name will be in lights,"


1011
02:08:24.112 --> 02:08:27.323
"saying Johnny B. 
Goode tonight."

1012
02:08:27.324 --> 02:08:28.824
Go!

1013
02:08:28.825 --> 02:08:30.827
Go, Johnny, go, go!

1014
02:08:31.995 --> 02:08:34.039
Go, Johnny, go, go!

1015
02:08:35.082 --> 02:08:37.251
Go, Johnny, go, go!

1016
02:08:38.293 --> 02:08:40.586
Go, Johnny, go, go!

1017
02:08:40.587 --> 02:08:43.423
Go, Johnny B. Goode.

1018
02:09:00.482 --> 02:09:02.651
Thank you all.
See you sometime.


1019
02:09:48.739 --> 02:09:49.822
What am I going to do?

1020
02:09:49.823 --> 02:09:51.657
I'm going straight home
and get into bed.


1021
02:09:51.658 --> 02:09:53.951
I've been here since 9:00
yesterday morning,


1022
02:09:53.952 --> 02:09:55.911
and I must go home
and get into bed.


1023
02:09:55.912 --> 02:09:57.873
I'm going straight home
and get into bed.


1024
02:10:00.542 --> 02:10:02.043
Straight home and get into bed.

1025
02:10:02.044 --> 02:10:04.545
Go home before you kill yourself.

1026
02:10:04.546 --> 02:10:07.090
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight!


1027
02:10:15.182 --> 02:10:19.101
Annie laid her head down

1028
02:10:19.102 --> 02:10:21.313
in the roses.

1029
02:10:23.565 --> 02:10:26.567
She had ribbons, ribbons,

1030
02:10:26.568 --> 02:10:32.115
ribbons in her long brown hair.

1031
02:10:35.577 --> 02:10:37.703
I don't know,

1032
02:10:37.704 --> 02:10:41.750
maybe it was the roses.

1033
02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:46.295
All I know,

1034
02:10:46.296 --> 02:10:50.217
I could not leave her there.

1035
02:10:53.553 --> 02:10:55.638
I don't know,

1036
02:10:55.639 --> 02:10:59.768
it must have been the roses.

1037
02:11:02.437 --> 02:11:06.649
The roses or the ribbons

1038
02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:11.071
in her long brown hair.

1039
02:11:14.157 --> 02:11:16.367
I don't know,

1040
02:11:16.368 --> 02:11:20.580
maybe it was the roses.

1041
02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:25.042
All I know,

1042
02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:28.505
I could not leave her there.

1043
02:11:32.134 --> 02:11:36.554
Ten years, the waves rolled

1044
02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:40.891
the ships home from the sea.

1045
02:11:40.892 --> 02:11:45.187
Thinking, well, how it may blow

1046
02:11:45.188 --> 02:11:49.817
in all good company.

1047
02:11:49.818 --> 02:11:53.487
If I tell another

1048
02:11:53.488 --> 02:11:57.492
what your own lips told to me,

1049
02:11:58.076 --> 02:12:02.621
Let me lay beneath the roses,

1050
02:12:02.622 --> 02:12:07.710
let my eyes no longer see.

1051
02:12:07.711 --> 02:12:09.712
I don't know,

1052
02:12:09.713 --> 02:12:13.759
it must have been the roses.

1053
02:12:16.428 --> 02:12:20.681
The roses or the ribbons

1054
02:12:20.682 --> 02:12:24.519
in her long brown hair.

1055
02:12:27.731 --> 02:12:29.857
I don't know,

1056
02:12:29.858 --> 02:12:34.237
maybe it was the roses.

1057
02:12:36.698 --> 02:12:38.324
All I know,

1058
02:12:38.325 --> 02:12:42.162
I could not leave her there.
