1
00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:51.728
Matias Reyes: I showed them
the top of the entrance,


2
00:00:51.748 --> 00:00:53.971
the direction she came by.

3
00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.903
I showed them where
she made the turn.


4
00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:05.057
I showed them where I
picked up the tree branch


5
00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:08.067
and down the road where

6
00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:10.829
I struck her over the
head with the tree branch


7
00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:13.396
and where I dragged her in.

8
00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.484
She just kept
moaning, you know,


9
00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:20.812
saying stop, and
grabbing her head.


10
00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:23.559
You know, because she was in
pain and all that, you know.


11
00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:27.238
She was bleeding.

12
00:01:30.774 --> 00:01:33.558
I can't explain to you what
happened after I left there,


13
00:01:33.578 --> 00:01:35.055
that park that night.

14
00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:38.549
But I can guarantee you, that
there was no way these kids


15
00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.610
saw this woman come
in or have a idea of


16
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.415
where she was coming from.

17
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.493
I'm the one that did this.

18
00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:08.123
- Ready?
- Yeah.


19
00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.562
Approximately 1:30
this morning, ah,


20
00:02:10.582 --> 00:02:12.493
two males walking
through Central Park


21
00:02:12.513 --> 00:02:16.852
north of the 102nd street
jogging path found a female.


22
00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:19.431
She was still alive, and
in fact still is alive.


23
00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.902
The female was clad
only in a bra.


24
00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:24.440
She was lying exposed
in the area,


25
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.377
appeared to have been exposed
for a couple of hours.


26
00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:28.782
Her body temperature
was down very low.


27
00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:30.892
Around her mouth there's
an article of clothing


28
00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:32.756
that was wrapped
around her face,


29
00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:37.230
and the same article was used
to bind her wrists to her face.


30
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.368
She had been struck around
the head repeatedly,


31
00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:40.670
mud on her body.

32
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.161
She appears to have been
dragged through the woods,


33
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:45.780
north into the, ah, shrub area.

34
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.522
She was taken to Metropolitan
Hospital where she is classified


35
00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.693
as, ah, in serious condition.

36
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:03.043
I look back at the jogger
case and wish I had been


37
00:03:03.063 --> 00:03:05.270
more skeptical as a journalist.

38
00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:09.930
You know, a lot of people
didn't do their jobs...


39
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.400
reporters, police,
prosecutors, defense lawyers.


40
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.118
This was a proxy
war being fought.


41
00:03:19.662 --> 00:03:22.825
And these young men
were the proxies


42
00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:25.456
for all kinds of other agendas.

43
00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:30.333
And the truth and the reality and
justice were not part of it.


44
00:03:47.683 --> 00:03:48.896
The bulls are galloping...

45
00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:50.900
Do you have a
passport, Mr. Gotti?


46
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.605
Given the alarming spread
of aids, New York...


47
00:03:54.543 --> 00:03:56.193
If you don't like
it, you're fired.


48
00:03:57.532 --> 00:03:58.847
Tom Brokaw: A savage
racial attack...


49
00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:00.751
In the middle-class
neighborhood of Howard Beach...


50
00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:02.989
A mob of whites
attacked 3 black men...


51
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.427
Peter Jennings: The mayor of New
York called it a racial lynching.


52
00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:07.215
Yo, off with
the camera, man.


53
00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:14.176
New York, under-policed city
with crime out of control.


54
00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:16.566
The criminal justice
system isn't working.


55
00:04:16.632 --> 00:04:18.782
They call him the
subway vigilante.


56
00:04:18.802 --> 00:04:21.488
Dan Rather: Goetz bent over one
of his wounded victims and said,


57
00:04:21.508 --> 00:04:23.292
"You don't look too bad.
Here's another"...


58
00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:24.461
If I had more bullets, I
would have shot them all


59
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:25.662
again and again.

60
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.384
It's about time someone
stood up for himself.


61
00:04:29.856 --> 00:04:31.207
25-year-old
Michael Stewart...


62
00:04:31.227 --> 00:04:32.644
16-year-old
Yusef Hawkins...


63
00:04:32.664 --> 00:04:34.715
Where 67-year-old
Eleanor Bumpers lived


64
00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:36.919
until police came to evict her
and ended up killing her.


65
00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.124
New York is now the capital
of racial violence.


66
00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:41.493
I am. People: I am!

67
00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:42.930
Somebody. Somebody!

68
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.702
You want to use the
gun, we'll use the gun.


69
00:04:45.722 --> 00:04:48.140
None of us is safe. Even
if you lock yourself


70
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.610
behind doors...

71
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.848
There's now a new level of
random violence in this city.


72
00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:56.223
It's intolerable and this
city will rise up in its wrath


73
00:04:56.243 --> 00:04:58.846
against those who
perpetrate monstrosities.


74
00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:10.451
Antron McCray: Harlem. 1989.

75
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:14.426
My neighborhood, it's
a small neighborhood.


76
00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:15.494
When I was younger, all
the kids would say


77
00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:17.932
it was the suburbs of Harlem.

78
00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:20.222
It was like 3 different projects
around my neighborhood.


79
00:05:22.727 --> 00:05:25.714
Raymond Santana,
Kevin Richardson,


80
00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:30.356
Korey Wise, Yusef Salaam,
I didn't know them,


81
00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:31.644
but I seen them around
my neighborhood.


82
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:43.015
I lived in the
Bronx at one time,


83
00:05:43.035 --> 00:05:45.220
and the Bronx is
more quiet life.


84
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.691
You know, um, even though
it was the projects.


85
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:51.966
It was very secluded,
everybody knew each other.


86
00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:54.972
When I moved to Harlem,
Harlem was very fast-paced.


87
00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:56.107
Everything moved fast.

88
00:05:56.127 --> 00:05:59.748
The cars moved fast; The
people; The, the lingo.


89
00:05:59.768 --> 00:06:00.935
It was a big culture shock.

90
00:06:04.142 --> 00:06:05.727
McCray: I was the only child.

91
00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:08.431
And me and my mother,
we was close,


92
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.337
but my father was
my best friend.


93
00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:13.508
I thought he was
like a superhero.


94
00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:16.481
He coached all of my
little league teams.


95
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.635
He was a great teacher.

96
00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.293
I played shortstop,
I played pitcher.


97
00:06:22.313 --> 00:06:23.528
In little league, you get
to play everything...


98
00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:26.234
outfield, catcher.

99
00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:27.821
But my favorite
position was shortstop.


100
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:36.921
Santana, Jr.: My dad
is from Puerto Rico.


101
00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:39.627
My mother's a mix of
Puerto Rican and Black.


102
00:06:39.647 --> 00:06:41.764
So, my dad is, like,
light-skinned Puerto Ricans.


103
00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:44.402
And my mother's side was
more, like, dark skin.


104
00:06:44.422 --> 00:06:46.959
You know, so we have, like,
the best of both worlds.


105
00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.358
I used to
ride skateboards.


106
00:06:55.378 --> 00:06:58.564
I used to play things like hide
and go seek and, you know,


107
00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.635
used to run around with
a lot of the people


108
00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:01.588
from the neighborhood.

109
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.245
As a kid, I knew Yusef

110
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:08.549
and I must say he
was a good kid.


111
00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:13.961
Ah, he had, ah... Him and his
family ah, had just moved


112
00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:15.916
into the Schomburg Complex.

113
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:22.545
Korey and Yusef, we grew
up in the same buildin'.


114
00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:25.418
So, you know, of course I've
seen 'em around and our parents


115
00:07:25.438 --> 00:07:27.672
knew each other from
just day-to-day.


116
00:07:31.782 --> 00:07:33.967
Salaam: It was my mother,
my sister, and my brother.


117
00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.104
And my mother was
a single parent,


118
00:07:36.124 --> 00:07:37.592
teaching at Parsons University.

119
00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:43.151
She encouraged all of us to do
good work, good quality work.


120
00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.139
Whatever we did.

121
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.798
Wise: When I was a kid,
had a little hearin',


122
00:07:49.818 --> 00:07:50.952
little hearin' problem.

123
00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:57.780
But I just found myself just
ignorin' it to the point


124
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.303
where it affected my life.

125
00:08:03.845 --> 00:08:06.030
I grew up with a big family.

126
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.933
A lot of women in my family.

127
00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:10.639
My mother plus 4 sisters.

128
00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:13.712
Woman: He's the baby and
he was treated as such.


129
00:08:13.732 --> 00:08:19.356
And, you know, mama's only boy
out of 5 children and the baby.


130
00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:22.346
So he was just our hearts',
like, joy, everybody's.


131
00:08:25.454 --> 00:08:26.671
Santana, Jr.: At
that time I was


132
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:27.706
just getting into music.

133
00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:31.573
Watching videos.
"MTV Raps" was kinda big,


134
00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:32.653
so, we, we watched that.

135
00:08:32.673 --> 00:08:35.302
We would record the videos and
we would watch 'em over and over


136
00:08:35.322 --> 00:08:36.879
and over all day, you know.

137
00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:38.677
You know, my dad would
come in the house, say,


138
00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:40.991
"You still watching that
video from when I left?"


139
00:08:41.011 --> 00:08:43.081
You know, that's how
far my range was.


140
00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:49.267
I think that I was at that point
of coming into who I was,


141
00:08:49.287 --> 00:08:52.506
you know, but I never really...
I never really got there.


142
00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:13.283
New York in the late

143
00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.752
schizophrenic, divided city.

144
00:09:16.772 --> 00:09:19.885
There was enormous wealth
gushing into the city


145
00:09:19.905 --> 00:09:24.354
out of the rise of the financial
industries, which had surged


146
00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:26.472
beginning around 1980.

147
00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:31.490
So, the city that had
been in a big collapse


148
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.190
for several decades
had turned around.


149
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:41.526
But there was a whole side to the
city in which drug gangsters


150
00:09:41.546 --> 00:09:47.462
and crack and a kind of hard,
permanently locked underclass


151
00:09:47.482 --> 00:09:48.461
was in place.

152
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.048
And there was
enormous suffering.


153
00:09:52.349 --> 00:09:55.830
It was as if there
was a social moat


154
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.983
that divided these
two New Yorks.


155
00:10:06.753 --> 00:10:09.769
The city, when I came in,
uh, was on the edge of, uh,


156
00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:14.204
bankruptcy, and people thought
we would not, uh, recover.


157
00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:15.704
We were a city coming out of

158
00:10:15.724 --> 00:10:19.606
a series of crises and an
enormous economic crisis.


159
00:10:19.626 --> 00:10:22.640
A school system that
was in collapse;


160
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.707
political institutions that
seemed to be failing the people


161
00:10:24.727 --> 00:10:27.409
and not meeting their needs;

162
00:10:27.429 --> 00:10:29.342
old, fashionable, beautiful,

163
00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:32.377
noble neighborhoods
falling apart.


164
00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:36.412
Koch: And, of course,
overriding was crime.


165
00:10:36.432 --> 00:10:39.846
Several things happened to
me that I just considered


166
00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:42.614
normal part of living
in New York City.


167
00:10:42.634 --> 00:10:45.481
A couple of muggings
and near muggings


168
00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:48.315
and I didn't even report
any of these things.


169
00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:50.200
Just kind of figured
it's the way it is.


170
00:10:51.502 --> 00:10:53.418
People had it worked
out in their heads


171
00:10:53.438 --> 00:10:57.585
that their block was safe,
the streets they walked


172
00:10:57.605 --> 00:11:00.419
to get to the subway to
go to work, they were OK.


173
00:11:00.439 --> 00:11:03.120
Their subway line, they
got on the same spot


174
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.154
on the train every day.

175
00:11:05.174 --> 00:11:06.655
That was OK.

176
00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:12.389
They had figured out a safe
path through this, ah...


177
00:11:12.409 --> 00:11:14.475
You know, garden of terrors.

178
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:24.027
Koch: And then in about '84,
crack came to New York City


179
00:11:24.047 --> 00:11:26.327
and that increased crime.

180
00:11:26.347 --> 00:11:29.629
No question, uh, about it.

181
00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:31.329
Wilder: When the
crack wars happen,


182
00:11:31.349 --> 00:11:35.631
all of a sudden teenagers
have lots of cash and guns.


183
00:11:35.651 --> 00:11:39.199
And all hell breaks loose
in Bedford-Stuyvesant,


184
00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:40.766
all hell breaks loose in Harlem,

185
00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:44.034
all hell breaks loose in
Brownsville, East New York.


186
00:11:44.054 --> 00:11:45.802
We were supposed to be afraid.

187
00:11:45.822 --> 00:11:48.968
It would have been
irrational not to be afraid.


188
00:11:48.988 --> 00:11:52.970
But the people who suffered most
with the rise of criminality,


189
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.472
gang wars, drug wars, were
actually the people we blamed.


190
00:11:57.492 --> 00:12:01.573
Most of the homicides
were young, poor,


191
00:12:01.593 --> 00:12:05.140
working class black
and brown kids.


192
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.342
And the dominant
social message was


193
00:12:07.362 --> 00:12:09.894
no one cared if you
lived or died.


194
00:12:17.864 --> 00:12:20.846
As far as I'm concerned,
in the late eighties,


195
00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:25.047
in New York City, the black
community was under assault.


196
00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:28.582
"The most endangered
species in America,"


197
00:12:28.602 --> 00:12:33.535
that was a popular phrase,
was the young black man.


198
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.889
Richardson: It was
a nice night.


199
00:12:49.909 --> 00:12:53.890
We was just, um, just hanging
out outside, playing basketball


200
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.175
where I lived at in Schomburg.

201
00:12:57.244 --> 00:12:58.892
Santana, Jr.: It was
a holiday coming up.


202
00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:01.027
We didn't have school.

203
00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:02.660
A couple of friends
wanted to go hang out.


204
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.095
I told him, you know, ah,

205
00:13:05.115 --> 00:13:07.495
"Too much trouble
in the corner.


206
00:13:07.515 --> 00:13:09.595
Um, go to the park."

207
00:13:09.615 --> 00:13:11.381
I sent him to that
park that night.


208
00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:15.549
So, I feel guilt, too.

209
00:13:21.018 --> 00:13:22.700
Wise: I was comin'
from a restaurant


210
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.568
on the corner of 110th street.

211
00:13:25.588 --> 00:13:27.320
We walked over to 110th street.

212
00:13:28.921 --> 00:13:32.803
Almost in front of the
entrance to Schomburg Plaza.


213
00:13:32.823 --> 00:13:37.672
Comin' from 110th and Madison,
there was a group of people.


214
00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:42.925
I see this mob
turning the corner.


215
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.241
Wise: Good kids and bad kids.

216
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:51.443
Kids just out to have some fun.

217
00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:53.744
McCray: Some of them I
didn't know by face;


218
00:13:53.764 --> 00:13:55.578
some of them went to my school;

219
00:13:55.598 --> 00:13:57.029
some of them lived
in my neighborhood.


220
00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:00.313
Yusef came my way.

221
00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:01.313
I see Korey. I said,

222
00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.746
"Hey, come and hang out.

223
00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:04.514
We're about to hang
out in the park."


224
00:14:04.534 --> 00:14:08.515
A close friend of
mine, he stayed back.


225
00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:11.250
We was all playing basketball
and he was like, "Don't go."


226
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.301
Like, stay here."

227
00:14:14.036 --> 00:14:15.536
Next thing I know, we was
going into the park.


228
00:14:26.673 --> 00:14:28.856
Wise: Walk in, a
few of the guys


229
00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:30.723
horse playin' with each other.

230
00:14:30.743 --> 00:14:32.756
Jumpin' on each other's back,
beatin' each other up.


231
00:14:32.776 --> 00:14:33.890
Just horse playin'.

232
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.842
We start going towards
the main road.


233
00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:40.110
And people started throwing
rocks at the cars.


234
00:14:42.346 --> 00:14:45.495
A couple, they was
on a tandem bike.


235
00:14:45.515 --> 00:14:48.628
And some kids is harassing 'em
or sayin' something to them.


236
00:14:48.648 --> 00:14:50.129
Looked like they was
trying to pull 'em off


237
00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:53.897
and the bicyclists kept
they, held their balance


238
00:14:53.917 --> 00:14:56.265
and they just kept goin'.

239
00:14:56.285 --> 00:14:59.032
A homeless person starts
walking across the street


240
00:14:59.052 --> 00:15:01.084
and the guys surround him.

241
00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.667
McCray: He had some food.

242
00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:05.702
Some of the guys
out of the group


243
00:15:05.722 --> 00:15:08.319
took his food, beat him up.

244
00:15:09.821 --> 00:15:11.903
Salaam: They were beating
this guy up really badly,


245
00:15:11.923 --> 00:15:15.238
and at some point in
time someone poured out


246
00:15:15.258 --> 00:15:19.372
a beer bottle, and then smashed
him in the head with it.


247
00:15:19.392 --> 00:15:20.939
You know, it was
kinda unbelievable


248
00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:23.774
to see that and, and to see,
like, this guy getting,


249
00:15:23.794 --> 00:15:26.492
you know, jumped on by
all these teenagers.


250
00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:32.344
McCray: I remember police
coming, everybody split up.


251
00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.278
Santana, Jr.: They shined a
light and the group kind of


252
00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:37.078
dispersed. Everybody ran.

253
00:15:37.098 --> 00:15:40.279
That's when it was time
for me to go home.


254
00:15:40.299 --> 00:15:43.166
I left the park when
everybody scattered.


255
00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:47.248
Santana, Jr.: We was gonna
leave but somebody said,


256
00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:48.782
"Well, let's go find
the rest of the guys


257
00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:49.916
"and we'll break out.

258
00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:51.801
"We'll go home." And
that's what we did.


259
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.240
Salaam: We crossed down onto
the 96th street traverse


260
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.912
and climbed up the rocks
to the other side.


261
00:16:00.932 --> 00:16:02.131
We was by a reservoir.

262
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:07.621
I remember a man running
by and some kids that are


263
00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:09.725
throwing rocks at him.

264
00:16:09.745 --> 00:16:11.862
And he kept running.

265
00:16:11.882 --> 00:16:14.199
Another person came running by.

266
00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:16.235
And when he got in the middle,
they kind of came out


267
00:16:16.255 --> 00:16:18.205
and they jumped on him.

268
00:16:18.225 --> 00:16:21.627
We was watching from a distance.
I didn't take part in that.


269
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.484
And I'm like, wow, this
guy just picked him up


270
00:16:26.504 --> 00:16:28.053
and threw him into the gate.

271
00:16:28.073 --> 00:16:30.223
Then he just starts punching
him and beating him.


272
00:16:30.243 --> 00:16:32.278
And then somebody
yelled, "Police."


273
00:16:34.249 --> 00:16:36.732
Richardson: Commotion.

274
00:16:36.752 --> 00:16:38.101
Some kids, like,
running that way,


275
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:40.538
and some kids going
the other way.


276
00:16:40.558 --> 00:16:42.242
Trying to find our way outside,

277
00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:43.294
out of the park.

278
00:16:44.898 --> 00:16:47.517
McCray: I think it was
between, like, 9:00 and 10:00.


279
00:16:47.537 --> 00:16:49.820
I was leaving the park
around that time,


280
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.873
because I had a curfew.

281
00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:57.030
Salaam: I remember walking with
this small group to the 1,


282
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.685
2, and the 3 train on Broadway.

283
00:17:00.656 --> 00:17:02.205
The only crime I
committed that night


284
00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:03.760
was I hopped the turnstile.

285
00:17:06.731 --> 00:17:08.615
Santana, Jr.: On
Central Park West,


286
00:17:08.635 --> 00:17:10.251
a car pulled up in front of me

287
00:17:10.271 --> 00:17:11.886
and two officers jumped out.

288
00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:15.426
And one grabbed me.
And, um... And,


289
00:17:15.446 --> 00:17:17.662
and when I turned back,
the crowd scattered


290
00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:18.731
and everybody ran.

291
00:17:18.751 --> 00:17:21.669
Police was chasing
me and I had


292
00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:24.507
nowhere else to go, so, there
was a wall and you jump


293
00:17:24.527 --> 00:17:27.644
over the wall, you go
back into the park.


294
00:17:27.664 --> 00:17:29.514
They handcuffed us
and put in the car.


295
00:17:29.534 --> 00:17:31.484
And then his partner ran and
he jumped over the wall


296
00:17:31.504 --> 00:17:33.471
into the park and he took off.

297
00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:38.962
Richardson: Somebody told me
to, "Freeze or I will shoot."


298
00:17:38.982 --> 00:17:42.267
My fear even went up more
so I just kept runnin'.


299
00:17:42.287 --> 00:17:44.470
One of the cops, he tackled me.

300
00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.209
All my clothes was just
all dirty and muddy.


301
00:17:48.229 --> 00:17:53.017
And he had a helmet, and he
swung it across my face.


302
00:17:53.037 --> 00:17:54.738
And he handcuffed me
and I said, um...


303
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.478
I thinks he said, um,
like, "What's goin' on?"


304
00:18:10.498 --> 00:18:13.347
And he said,

305
00:18:13.367 --> 00:18:16.587
he was like, you know, "Didn't
I tell you not to run?"


306
00:18:16.607 --> 00:18:19.157
Like, you, it's like "You
little, little animal"


307
00:18:19.177 --> 00:18:21.827
or something.

308
00:18:21.847 --> 00:18:27.621
So, um, I basically said, "Oh, I
didn't do nothin', you know."


309
00:18:31.596 --> 00:18:33.947
And we sat in the police
cars for a while.


310
00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:35.348
They rounded up a few people

311
00:18:35.368 --> 00:18:38.304
and we proceeded
to the precinct.


312
00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:53.309
Santana, Jr.:
They brung us in.


313
00:18:53.329 --> 00:18:55.779
They took shots,
ah... photos of us


314
00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:57.000
and then they put us in a room.

315
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.521
Richardson: 14.
Never got arrested.


316
00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:04.827
Never had handcuffs on me.

317
00:19:04.847 --> 00:19:05.948
Scared to death.

318
00:19:07.284 --> 00:19:10.035
I could recall one
cop lookin' at me.


319
00:19:10.055 --> 00:19:14.908
He says, "What's
that on your face?"


320
00:19:14.928 --> 00:19:18.982
And ha, I, I said, um,
"One of your one, of your,


321
00:19:19.002 --> 00:19:20.652
your fellow workers hit me."

322
00:19:20.672 --> 00:19:23.857
And he said, "One of
my, my fellow workers?"


323
00:19:23.877 --> 00:19:26.127
Where at? Come point
him out to me."


324
00:19:26.147 --> 00:19:28.081
You know, like I was lying.

325
00:19:30.786 --> 00:19:33.638
They asked me what was going on
next, and the guys are sayin',


326
00:19:33.658 --> 00:19:35.708
"wW'll give you a ticket for
family court and you'll,


327
00:19:35.728 --> 00:19:38.246
you'll be right outta here
in no, in no time soon."


328
00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:40.834
We were sitting there
for a long time.


329
00:19:49.514 --> 00:19:51.599
Richardson: It took
a while but they


330
00:19:51.619 --> 00:19:54.088
begin to call parents.

331
00:19:56.025 --> 00:19:59.329
Black: My mother received
a call from the precinct


332
00:19:59.379 --> 00:20:02.528
and they told her to come
pick up Kevin up from, um,


333
00:20:02.548 --> 00:20:05.264
it was the Central Park precinct
and that he had been picked up


334
00:20:05.284 --> 00:20:08.734
for, I believe it was
unlawful assembly.


335
00:20:08.754 --> 00:20:12.804
3 policemen knock
on my door and say,


336
00:20:12.824 --> 00:20:15.440
"Oh, you ain't know your son
was in the police station?"


337
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.975
I said, "No."

338
00:20:16.995 --> 00:20:18.943
And they tell me,
"Come on, let's go."


339
00:20:18.963 --> 00:20:20.445
I had to get dressed.

340
00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:22.714
And then my mother was there,

341
00:20:22.734 --> 00:20:24.048
and she got scared.

342
00:20:24.068 --> 00:20:25.884
And she said, "I
going with you."


343
00:20:25.904 --> 00:20:28.887
So, she went with me.

344
00:20:28.907 --> 00:20:31.655
I started seeing a
lot of parents.


345
00:20:31.675 --> 00:20:34.525
We feelin' a little
better, you know,


346
00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:37.746
thinkin' that we,
that we gonna be OK.


347
00:20:49.658 --> 00:20:51.274
Woman: The jogger was
discovered about


348
00:20:51.294 --> 00:20:54.077
1:30 in the morning
by passersby.


349
00:20:54.097 --> 00:20:58.981
She was in the underbrush in the
northern reaches of the park


350
00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:02.584
and she was taken to
Metropolitan Hospital.


351
00:21:02.604 --> 00:21:04.653
Dwyer: Her skull
was fractured.


352
00:21:04.673 --> 00:21:09.292
She lost a good deal
of her body fluids.


353
00:21:09.312 --> 00:21:12.879
She was virtually dead.

354
00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:18.633
The kids were about to be
released when a detective


355
00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:22.036
who realized the gravity of
the injuries of the victim


356
00:21:22.056 --> 00:21:26.740
called the precinct and said,
"Hold on to those guys."


357
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.375
And it was from
that moment forward


358
00:21:28.395 --> 00:21:32.498
that everything
plowed towards them.


359
00:21:35.301 --> 00:21:37.451
Black: The next time I
heard from my mother,


360
00:21:37.471 --> 00:21:38.518
she woke me up.

361
00:21:38.538 --> 00:21:39.686
And, ah, she says,

362
00:21:39.706 --> 00:21:42.088
"I'm still here
at the precinct."


363
00:21:42.108 --> 00:21:43.624
And I says, "Well, why
are you still there?"


364
00:21:43.644 --> 00:21:46.359
And she said, um,
"Well, they sayin'


365
00:21:46.379 --> 00:21:48.027
they waitin' for paperwork."

366
00:21:48.047 --> 00:21:49.629
I was wondering what's wrong.

367
00:21:49.649 --> 00:21:52.231
And I told 'em if I could see my
son because I saw him next door


368
00:21:52.251 --> 00:21:54.199
in the room with all the kids.

369
00:21:54.219 --> 00:21:57.536
And they said, "No, you
gotta wait till morning."


370
00:21:57.556 --> 00:22:01.206
So I tell my mother, "Stay with
him and let me to go to work."


371
00:22:01.226 --> 00:22:03.675
They probably gonna release
him in the morning anyway.


372
00:22:03.695 --> 00:22:07.497
I don't see nothin' wrong
and I went to work.


373
00:22:21.011 --> 00:22:23.194
Dwyer: Initially, the case
was going to be handled


374
00:22:23.214 --> 00:22:25.162
by the Central Park precinct.

375
00:22:25.182 --> 00:22:29.600
But she was thought to be near
death, and homicide cases are


376
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.335
handled typically by
these homicide squads.


377
00:22:32.355 --> 00:22:36.439
And Manhattan North was
a prestigious bunch


378
00:22:36.459 --> 00:22:37.440
of detectives

379
00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.543
with a great deal of
pride in their work


380
00:22:39.563 --> 00:22:42.279
and swagger in their step.

381
00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:47.316
Two prosecutors, Linda Fairstein
and Elizabeth Lederer.


382
00:22:47.336 --> 00:22:49.986
They were part of
the investigation.


383
00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:52.955
And they were operating
not only as prosecutors


384
00:22:52.975 --> 00:22:53.907
but investigators.

385
00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:02.364
Byfield: I was getting
ready for work


386
00:23:02.384 --> 00:23:04.733
and I heard the news.

387
00:23:04.753 --> 00:23:09.705
And instantly your mind
goes into the calculus.


388
00:23:09.725 --> 00:23:10.805
An unidentified white woman

389
00:23:10.825 --> 00:23:12.807
found raped in
Northern Central Park.


390
00:23:12.827 --> 00:23:14.008
Oh.

391
00:23:14.028 --> 00:23:15.743
I think virtually every

392
00:23:15.763 --> 00:23:18.112
ethnic and racial group in New
York has these moments where


393
00:23:18.132 --> 00:23:21.482
you, your, your heart just sort
of stops and your stomach turns


394
00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:24.284
and you think to yourself, oh,
please don't let it be us.


395
00:23:24.304 --> 00:23:27.254
...Police have 5 teenagers
in custody right now...


396
00:23:27.274 --> 00:23:29.456
Richardson: First we
was all together.


397
00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:34.245
Then they started to put us in
different rooms separately.


398
00:23:36.349 --> 00:23:38.031
Different cops coming
back and forth.


399
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:41.268
And one cop sayin', "Well, we
just heard that a woman was"


400
00:23:41.288 --> 00:23:44.437
raped and beaten in the park."

401
00:23:44.457 --> 00:23:46.472
Now he says, "What
happened to the lady?"


402
00:23:46.492 --> 00:23:48.774
And I'm saying, "What lady?"

403
00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:50.977
And he says, "What do
you mean what lady?"


404
00:23:50.997 --> 00:23:53.678
The lady who got
raped in the park."


405
00:23:53.698 --> 00:23:55.381
I say, "Yeah, I was in the park."

406
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:59.317
"And I was, yeah, I was,
you know, all around.


407
00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:00.318
But that I don't know about."

408
00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:01.420
"What do you mean
you don't know?


409
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.721
You just... " And I said, " No.

410
00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:05.991
Never came across no lady."

411
00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:07.659
So now we going back
through the statement


412
00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.027
from the top, again.

413
00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:10.895
"What did you do?"
"Who were you with?"


414
00:24:10.915 --> 00:24:14.965
"Who did you come with?"
And, um, same answers again.


415
00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:17.134
They gettin' a little
angry 'cause I guess


416
00:24:17.154 --> 00:24:19.656
they not gettin' a
word outta anybody.


417
00:24:21.391 --> 00:24:23.774
Dwyer: The detectives are
trying to piece together


418
00:24:23.794 --> 00:24:26.743
a narrative of what happened and
they're trying to make it fit


419
00:24:26.763 --> 00:24:30.114
what they know happened:
A woman ended up


420
00:24:30.134 --> 00:24:34.151
at the bottom of a ravine
in the park almost dead


421
00:24:34.171 --> 00:24:37.553
and a bunch of other
people got hassled or hurt


422
00:24:37.573 --> 00:24:38.855
in some way by these kids.

423
00:24:38.875 --> 00:24:43.593
So, they're trying to
make the story climb


424
00:24:43.613 --> 00:24:45.461
some sort of ladder of facts.

425
00:24:45.481 --> 00:24:49.165
All hell is breaking loose
in Central Park that night.


426
00:24:49.185 --> 00:24:52.802
And there are gangs of kids
running around making mischief.


427
00:24:52.822 --> 00:24:55.971
It's not so hard to understand
why these kids were brought in,


428
00:24:55.991 --> 00:24:59.041
why they were interrogated
so aggressively,


429
00:24:59.061 --> 00:25:02.944
why police believed
they had amongst them


430
00:25:02.964 --> 00:25:05.680
the culprit or culprits.

431
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.367
Now they just have to
get the proof of it.


432
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.419
Santana, Jr.: Another
detective came into the room,


433
00:25:11.439 --> 00:25:13.120
he called my grandmother.

434
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.457
And he said, "Listen, can I talk
to you outside for a minute?"


435
00:25:16.477 --> 00:25:19.593
And when he took her outside,
that's when it started.


436
00:25:19.613 --> 00:25:20.961
He looks at me. He's like,

437
00:25:20.981 --> 00:25:24.130
"Oh, this is the scumbag
right here that did it."


438
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.567
Richardson: I remember one
guy specifically tell me,


439
00:25:26.587 --> 00:25:29.269
"You want to spend 25 to
life on Rikers Island?"


440
00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:30.670
You want to go to
jail for rape?


441
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.105
"'Cause they don't like
guys that rape women,"


442
00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:33.873
and things like that.

443
00:25:33.893 --> 00:25:38.510
You know, and I'm saying, like,
I'm, I'm, I'm tellin' the guy,


444
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.413
"I don't know what
you're talkin' about."


445
00:25:41.433 --> 00:25:43.115
Santana, Jr.: Now the
other officer comes in.


446
00:25:43.135 --> 00:25:45.284
He had about red
hair, a short guy.


447
00:25:45.304 --> 00:25:48.287
And he was like, "Oh, so this is the...
right here."


448
00:25:48.307 --> 00:25:50.556
And Arroyo says, "Yeah,
this is the guy here."


449
00:25:50.576 --> 00:25:52.658
He doesn't want to tell
us what happened."


450
00:25:52.678 --> 00:25:55.761
And I'm sittin' there like,
"Ah, what's going on?"


451
00:25:55.781 --> 00:25:59.130
And now Arroyo starts to
yell at me and then this guy


452
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.498
pulls up a chair next to me.

453
00:26:00.518 --> 00:26:02.167
He starts to yell
right in my ear.


454
00:26:02.187 --> 00:26:05.770
So I have Arroyo here yellin'
at me, blowing smoke in my face


455
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.705
with the cigarette, and then
I have this guy on my side


456
00:26:07.725 --> 00:26:09.073
and he's yellin' at me.

457
00:26:09.093 --> 00:26:10.708
And they're like, "You know you...
did it."


458
00:26:10.728 --> 00:26:12.910
You... stuck your... in her, right?
Didn't you?"


459
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.678
And I'm like, "What are
you talkin' about?"


460
00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:17.181
I didn't stick
nothin' in nobody."


461
00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:21.185
And I start to cry a little bit.
And then Hartigan jumps in.


462
00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:24.755
And I was grateful, you know,
at that point I was grateful


463
00:26:24.775 --> 00:26:27.157
'cause Hartigan stopped him
from trying to hurt me.


464
00:26:27.177 --> 00:26:28.492
Then again, the other
guy come back in


465
00:26:28.512 --> 00:26:32.729
screamin' and yellin, '
violating my personal space,


466
00:26:32.749 --> 00:26:35.164
so close to spittin' on me.

467
00:26:35.184 --> 00:26:37.600
And then my mother, she came
to the door, and she said,


468
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.634
"I need to see my son.

469
00:26:38.654 --> 00:26:40.002
I need to see my son."

470
00:26:40.022 --> 00:26:42.705
I looked out when I seen one of
the detectives, um, you know,


471
00:26:42.725 --> 00:26:45.975
take her by the shoulder,
put her back to her chair.


472
00:26:45.995 --> 00:26:48.477
And while he's talking to
her, they close the door


473
00:26:48.497 --> 00:26:49.879
and they questioning me.

474
00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:57.519
They knew that my mother was, was
a weak person, was disabled.


475
00:26:57.539 --> 00:26:59.421
And they, they used
that, you know.


476
00:26:59.441 --> 00:27:00.456
They used that.

477
00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:04.192
The officers, they
actually met me outside.


478
00:27:04.212 --> 00:27:06.093
They were like, "Oh,
your mother's, you know",


479
00:27:06.113 --> 00:27:09.364
"she's not well and since
you're, you know, of age,


480
00:27:09.384 --> 00:27:11.099
"you can stay and replace
your mother and we'll


481
00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:15.702
send her on home in a squad car,
and we'll make sure she's OK."


482
00:27:15.722 --> 00:27:19.072
And they said, "She was
cooperating with this process."


483
00:27:19.092 --> 00:27:21.942
So we sure that you're
gonna cooperate as well."


484
00:27:21.962 --> 00:27:24.444
So that, in they
constantly kept saying,


485
00:27:24.464 --> 00:27:25.778
"So that your brother
can go home."


486
00:27:25.798 --> 00:27:26.913
So that your brother
could go home.


487
00:27:26.933 --> 00:27:28.514
"So that..." And
that's all I wanted.


488
00:27:28.534 --> 00:27:30.067
I just wanted to
get him back home.


489
00:27:43.582 --> 00:27:45.797
McCray: There was a
loud knock at the door.


490
00:27:45.817 --> 00:27:48.033
It was 3 or 4 detectives.

491
00:27:48.053 --> 00:27:50.268
I thought they was there
because of the assaults


492
00:27:50.288 --> 00:27:51.888
on the people in Central Park.

493
00:27:53.791 --> 00:27:56.474
My father, he let them come in.

494
00:27:56.494 --> 00:27:58.076
These men, they looked
like giants, you know,


495
00:27:58.096 --> 00:28:00.211
compared to my father.

496
00:28:00.231 --> 00:28:02.546
He asked me to put
some sneakers on.


497
00:28:02.566 --> 00:28:05.950
He told my father he was going
to take me down to the precinct.


498
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.918
My father called my mother,

499
00:28:07.938 --> 00:28:11.255
and my mother met
us at the precinct.


500
00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:15.426
They was asking me questions a
female jogger in Central Park.


501
00:28:15.446 --> 00:28:17.627
And I was like, "There
was only one woman",


502
00:28:17.647 --> 00:28:19.630
"and she was with
a man on a bike.


503
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.297
But they rolled off."

504
00:28:21.317 --> 00:28:24.434
And he was like, "You
sure?" I was like, "Yeah."


505
00:28:24.454 --> 00:28:26.703
"What about the lady
that got raped?"


506
00:28:26.723 --> 00:28:30.340
I'm like, "What lady
that got raped?"


507
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.507
They just kept asking me about
this lady that got raped.


508
00:28:32.527 --> 00:28:35.611
And I kept telling them,
"There was only one lady."


509
00:28:35.631 --> 00:28:38.648
They asked my mother
to leave the room.


510
00:28:38.668 --> 00:28:40.315
I'm looking at my
father and he's like,


511
00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:41.483
"Are you telling the truth?"

512
00:28:41.503 --> 00:28:42.652
I was like, "Yeah, Dad,
I'm telling the truth."


513
00:28:42.672 --> 00:28:44.453
I swear I'm telling the truth."

514
00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:46.989
I always told my
father the truth.


515
00:28:47.009 --> 00:28:48.957
"I know nothing about no jogger.

516
00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:50.325
"I know some people
got beaten up,


517
00:28:50.345 --> 00:28:52.828
but I had nothing
to do with that."


518
00:28:52.848 --> 00:28:55.831
Then they asked me to
tell my story again.


519
00:28:55.851 --> 00:28:57.633
This time yelling at me.

520
00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:01.787
All up in my face, pointing
at me, poking me in my chest.


521
00:29:04.624 --> 00:29:07.275
It just kept going
on and on and on.


522
00:29:07.295 --> 00:29:11.177
We stopped a few times
because I was crying.


523
00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:16.083
And I had no protection. My
father didn't do anything.


524
00:29:16.103 --> 00:29:18.102
I was scared.

525
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.455
Santana, Jr.: Hours
have passed.


526
00:29:22.475 --> 00:29:24.157
Richardson: Time kept going by.

527
00:29:24.177 --> 00:29:25.659
McCray: They kept
asking questions.


528
00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.171
Santana, Jr.: No
food, no drink.


529
00:29:27.191 --> 00:29:30.281
McCray: I didn't eat. I
didn't get no sleep.


530
00:29:30.486 --> 00:29:33.190
Santana, Jr.: And I didn't
know when it was gonna end.


531
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.241
Kassin: Confrontation followed
by denial, followed by:


532
00:29:43.261 --> 00:29:48.164
"You're a liar, I want to hear
the truth" can go on for hours.


533
00:29:48.585 --> 00:29:51.929
And the, the goal there is
to break the suspect down


534
00:29:51.949 --> 00:29:55.593
into a state of despair, into a
state of helplessness, so that


535
00:29:55.613 --> 00:29:59.275
the suspect gets worn down and
is looking for a way out.


536
00:30:01.051 --> 00:30:03.541
McCray: They pulled
my father aside.


537
00:30:03.561 --> 00:30:04.912
Then my father came
back in the room,


538
00:30:04.932 --> 00:30:06.552
it was like he just changed.

539
00:30:06.572 --> 00:30:07.857
He just changed. He
was like, "Listen."


540
00:30:07.877 --> 00:30:09.094
He was like, "Tell these
people what they want to hear"


541
00:30:09.114 --> 00:30:11.905
so you can go home."

542
00:30:11.925 --> 00:30:14.548
If he just would've
stood his ground,


543
00:30:14.568 --> 00:30:15.584
I would've told the truth.

544
00:30:15.604 --> 00:30:16.909
I would've stuck to the truth.

545
00:30:20.957 --> 00:30:22.645
Santana, Jr.: Hartigan
sat down and he said,


546
00:30:22.665 --> 00:30:25.689
"Look, Ray. I know you
didn't do anything wrong.


547
00:30:25.709 --> 00:30:28.533
"But the other guys right now,
they're in other precincts


548
00:30:28.553 --> 00:30:30.039
and they're saying
that you did it."


549
00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:32.547
And they tellin' me,
"Well, you're not


550
00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:35.124
sayin' nothin' but these
guys put your name in it."


551
00:30:35.144 --> 00:30:37.098
And I'm like, "I
didn't do anything."


552
00:30:37.118 --> 00:30:39.139
And he's like, "Well, this is
why I'm here, to help."


553
00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:40.729
"Because I know you didn't do anything.

554
00:30:40.915 --> 00:30:43.360
You're a good kid. You
know, this isn't you."


555
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.758
He pulls out this picture
of Kevin Richardson.


556
00:30:45.778 --> 00:30:47.457
And he goes, "You
know this kid?"


557
00:30:47.477 --> 00:30:49.156
And I'm like, "No,
I don't know him."


558
00:30:49.176 --> 00:30:51.322
And he goes, "You see the
scratch under his eye?"


559
00:30:51.342 --> 00:30:54.219
"That came from the woman.
We know he did it.


560
00:30:54.239 --> 00:30:56.170
He's going down."

561
00:30:57.636 --> 00:31:01.880
At this point I'm like,
you know, like, I don't


562
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.910
know these, these guys that's,
that's there so I'm just gonna


563
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:11.840
make up somethin' and, and,
include these guys' names.


564
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.272
Ok. If, if, you know, if you're

565
00:31:14.292 --> 00:31:16.103
going to do it to me, then
I'm going to do it to you.


566
00:31:16.123 --> 00:31:18.236
They was coaching me and
I was writing it down.


567
00:31:18.256 --> 00:31:19.868
Santana, Jr.: He
just fed it to me.


568
00:31:19.888 --> 00:31:22.932
"Well, what did he do? What
did Antron McCray do?"


569
00:31:22.952 --> 00:31:25.563
He gave me the names.
I put 'em in.


570
00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:28.696
I couldn't tell you who they
were, who they looked like.


571
00:31:28.716 --> 00:31:32.910
If he woulda gave me a hundred
names, I woulda put a hundred
people at the crime scene.


572
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.129
McCray: And I was like,
"How can they lie?"


573
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:37.052
So I was like, "I'm
going to get him back."


574
00:31:37.072 --> 00:31:42.561
At that point, I told myself I
just, I just want to go home.


575
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:44.964
I thought I had the
upper hand because


576
00:31:44.984 --> 00:31:47.131
here I was, I had a
detective who was saying,


577
00:31:47.151 --> 00:31:49.201
"I'll make sure you go home."

578
00:31:49.221 --> 00:31:52.167
McCray: I was thinking that I
was never going to go home.


579
00:31:52.603 --> 00:31:54.650
I gave these people what
they want to hear.


580
00:31:54.894 --> 00:31:56.214
So I lied.

581
00:31:57.354 --> 00:31:58.228
I lied.

582
00:31:59.702 --> 00:32:01.153
I say, "Well, you
know, this is where"


583
00:32:01.173 --> 00:32:03.490
it happened at the reservoir."

584
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.726
You know, I'm placing the scene
of the crime at the reservoir.


585
00:32:06.746 --> 00:32:08.561
And, and he just, he
doesn't really say


586
00:32:08.581 --> 00:32:11.329
but he gives me this look like,
"What are you talking about?"


587
00:32:11.349 --> 00:32:13.599
McCray: He asked me
what she was wearing.


588
00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:14.999
I didn't know because
I wasn't there.


589
00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:18.671
So I remember one of the men
joggers that got assaulted,


590
00:32:18.691 --> 00:32:20.673
he had blue shorts
and a white shirt.


591
00:32:20.693 --> 00:32:23.075
That's what I said she had on.

592
00:32:23.095 --> 00:32:25.643
And then he said, "It's
gotta be more believable."


593
00:32:25.663 --> 00:32:27.680
"You know, Ray, people
don't fully believe it


594
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.682
if you just saw it."

595
00:32:28.702 --> 00:32:29.681
He said, "Where were you?"

596
00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:31.183
And I said, "I saw
it from a distance."


597
00:32:31.203 --> 00:32:32.350
I was watching."

598
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.220
And he said, "No,
you gotta be in it."


599
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.788
Like, you have to be there."

600
00:32:36.808 --> 00:32:39.290
McCray: As the time just,
you know, went on,


601
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.660
and my father wasn't
doing nothing.


602
00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.262
So, I was just like,
"I, whatever, yeah.


603
00:32:44.282 --> 00:32:47.751
"I had something to do with
it," just to get out of there.


604
00:32:49.587 --> 00:32:52.937
[Reading] Then we saw
this lady jogger.


605
00:32:52.957 --> 00:32:55.174
She had on gray shorts
with black biking pants


606
00:32:55.194 --> 00:32:56.674
and a white tank top.

607
00:32:56.694 --> 00:32:59.276
[Reading] I observed
the male, black Kevin,


608
00:32:59.296 --> 00:33:02.747
with scratch on face was
struggling with a female.


609
00:33:02.767 --> 00:33:04.549
McCray, reading: The
tall, thin black guy


610
00:33:04.569 --> 00:33:06.050
hit her in the ribs with a pipe.

611
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.186
[Reading] I moved back
and everybody started


612
00:33:08.206 --> 00:33:09.486
feeling on her.

613
00:33:09.506 --> 00:33:12.624
[Reading] Antron came and started
ripping her clothes off.


614
00:33:12.644 --> 00:33:14.644
McCray, reading: The Puerto
Rican kid with the black hoodie


615
00:33:14.664 --> 00:33:15.743
jumped on her.

616
00:33:15.763 --> 00:33:19.782
[Reading] I tried to grab her.
I got scratched on my face.


617
00:33:20.148 --> 00:33:23.700
Antron pulled her pants off
and she was screaming.


618
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.133
Richardson, reading:
Antron had sex with her.


619
00:33:26.274 --> 00:33:27.562
McCray, reading:
Then Kevin got on.


620
00:33:27.729 --> 00:33:28.854
Richardson, reading: That's
when she was yelling,


621
00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:30.064
"Stop" and "help."

622
00:33:30.324 --> 00:33:32.442
I was the one that
didn't rape her.


623
00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:35.717
[Reading] Kevin pulled down his
pants and had sex with her.


624
00:33:36.233 --> 00:33:38.810
When she was on the floor
I grabbed her tits.


625
00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:51.370
A 4, a 14-year-old boy
doesn't talk like this.


626
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.127
You know?

627
00:33:53.147 --> 00:33:54.223
At that time, being naive,

628
00:33:54.243 --> 00:33:58.899
I figured I'm not
implicating myself.


629
00:33:58.919 --> 00:33:59.960
I was crying at that time.

630
00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.088
He said, "Don't worry.
You did good."


631
00:34:01.108 --> 00:34:03.528
Everything's gonna be OK."

632
00:34:04.172 --> 00:34:06.047
McCray: When I first went
there, they said I was going to


633
00:34:06.067 --> 00:34:09.608
be a witness, and then just,
everything just flipped.


634
00:34:09.628 --> 00:34:14.831
You know, they had me raping
a woman, beating her.


635
00:34:14.851 --> 00:34:17.392
And they read the
statement to my mother.


636
00:34:17.412 --> 00:34:20.022
And she looked at me, and I was
like, "Ma, I didn't do it."


637
00:34:20.042 --> 00:34:22.968
She was like, "OK, I
know you didn't do it."


638
00:34:27.027 --> 00:34:29.503
Black: I walked in the
room and I could see


639
00:34:29.523 --> 00:34:30.668
that he was terrified.

640
00:34:30.688 --> 00:34:34.029
I could see him,
like, shivering.


641
00:34:34.049 --> 00:34:38.853
I said, "Kevin, I can't believe
you saw this woman get raped."


642
00:34:38.873 --> 00:34:40.714
And he looked at me.

643
00:34:40.734 --> 00:34:43.096
He say, "Angie, I
didn't see a rape."


644
00:34:50.516 --> 00:34:53.591
And I said, "Kevin, why
did you say that then?"


645
00:34:53.611 --> 00:34:56.703
He said, "'Cause they told me
to say it so I could go home."


646
00:34:58.135 --> 00:35:00.477
But they was like a orchestra,

647
00:35:00.497 --> 00:35:02.374
like they orchestrated
this whole thing.


648
00:35:02.394 --> 00:35:06.434
And I felt so dumb
for not realizing it


649
00:35:06.454 --> 00:35:08.116
till it was too late.

650
00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:16.149
When I came back, they
disappeared my son.


651
00:35:16.169 --> 00:35:18.144
He wasn't there no more.

652
00:35:18.164 --> 00:35:19.341
I said, "Where's my son?"

653
00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:21.505
He said, "They took him to
another police station."


654
00:35:21.525 --> 00:35:23.900
My father did make a return.

655
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.603
Um... But when he came
it was too late.


656
00:35:26.623 --> 00:35:29.223
And waited like 4 or 5 hours.

657
00:35:29.243 --> 00:35:32.152
And then he came in, handcuffed

658
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:34.380
and a lot of policemen
with, with him.


659
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.243
My dad's sittin' there, so I go

660
00:35:36.263 --> 00:35:39.204
through the same story but
now I add the woman in it.


661
00:35:39.224 --> 00:35:42.232
Now, my dad, this is the
first time he hears this,


662
00:35:42.252 --> 00:35:45.693
so he looks at me
and he goes, "What?"


663
00:35:45.713 --> 00:35:47.256
That happened?"

664
00:35:47.276 --> 00:35:49.303
And now I get quiet because now

665
00:35:49.323 --> 00:35:51.813
here's my dad, I
can't lie to him.


666
00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:54.110
And I... I'm like, you
know, I want to say,


667
00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.221
"Dad, don't say nothin',
it's tooken care of."


668
00:35:59.771 --> 00:36:04.551
Dwyer: In those days, there
were probably 6 murders a day.


669
00:36:04.712 --> 00:36:08.109
In the newsrooms, people
didn't always pay attention


670
00:36:08.129 --> 00:36:11.168
to whatever grisly event
of the day had happened.


671
00:36:11.188 --> 00:36:14.069
This one was different.

672
00:36:22.234 --> 00:36:24.693
Last night, a woman
jogger was found


673
00:36:24.713 --> 00:36:28.205
unconscious and partially
clothed in Central Park


674
00:36:28.225 --> 00:36:31.820
about 200 feet north of the

675
00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.199
What we, we believe happened is
the following: The victim was


676
00:36:35.219 --> 00:36:38.511
jogging across the 102nd street
cross drive when she was


677
00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:40.887
attacked by a dozen young males.

678
00:36:40.907 --> 00:36:43.532
She was dragged down in the
bushes near what is called


679
00:36:43.552 --> 00:36:48.148
"The Loch," where she was
beaten and sexually assaulted.


680
00:36:48.168 --> 00:36:50.593
5 youths were arrested
at 96th street


681
00:36:50.613 --> 00:36:52.633
and the west bridle path.

682
00:36:52.653 --> 00:36:55.411
We believe these youths and
others were responsible


683
00:36:55.431 --> 00:36:57.484
for two or 3 other
incidents that occurred


684
00:36:57.504 --> 00:37:03.206
in the park last night, assaults
on, on joggers and pedestrians.


685
00:37:03.226 --> 00:37:05.013
And we are currently
looking for others


686
00:37:05.033 --> 00:37:06.303
we believe to be involved.

687
00:37:09.816 --> 00:37:11.805
Salaam: When I came home, I
remember saying to myself,


688
00:37:11.825 --> 00:37:14.149
"Man, there's a whole bunch of
unmarked police cars out here.


689
00:37:14.169 --> 00:37:15.989
I wonder what happened?"

690
00:37:16.009 --> 00:37:21.610
I bumps into Korey at some point
and Korey says, um, he heard


691
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:25.793
that they were... are
looking for us.


692
00:37:25.813 --> 00:37:28.034
Wise: So, him and
I went upstairs.


693
00:37:28.054 --> 00:37:30.176
He had the detectives
at his door.


694
00:37:30.196 --> 00:37:31.881
And they said, "Oh,
this is one of the guys"


695
00:37:31.901 --> 00:37:33.321
we were looking for."

696
00:37:33.341 --> 00:37:34.827
Checked my name off.

697
00:37:34.847 --> 00:37:36.868
And they asked Korey who he was.

698
00:37:36.888 --> 00:37:38.642
He looked at the list.

699
00:37:38.662 --> 00:37:41.855
Said, "No, your name
ain't on here."


700
00:37:41.875 --> 00:37:45.500
So they said, "Ah,
you can come down",


701
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.474
come downtown with your buddy."

702
00:37:47.494 --> 00:37:48.564
You'll be right back."

703
00:37:50.405 --> 00:37:52.226
Salaam: We went
to the precinct


704
00:37:52.246 --> 00:37:54.334
and I came home 7 years later.

705
00:37:54.354 --> 00:37:56.159
He came home 13 years later.

706
00:38:00.043 --> 00:38:01.161
Wise: They said, ah,

707
00:38:01.181 --> 00:38:02.332
"Something happened
out in the park.


708
00:38:02.352 --> 00:38:04.841
You was out in the park
that night, right?"


709
00:38:04.861 --> 00:38:07.886
I say, "I was in the
park but I don't know"


710
00:38:07.906 --> 00:38:09.057
what you're talkin' about."

711
00:38:09.077 --> 00:38:12.839
"Kevin is saying this
happened, you know.


712
00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:16.050
Antron is saying this happened."

713
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.426
And they were stopping
me during my retelling


714
00:38:18.446 --> 00:38:21.337
of the events and saying,
"Is this where you got


715
00:38:21.357 --> 00:38:24.516
the woman? Is that where?"

716
00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:28.030
The tone was very, very scary.

717
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.811
I felt like these guys
are really angry.


718
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:34.387
And you know what?

719
00:38:34.407 --> 00:38:37.819
They might take us to the back
of the precinct and kill us.


720
00:38:39.593 --> 00:38:41.281
A lot of time had gone by.

721
00:38:41.301 --> 00:38:42.636
I didn't even know
what time it was.


722
00:38:45.013 --> 00:38:47.738
Wise: Detective
Hartigan says, "Korey?"


723
00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:50.615
"You look like you
real tired, man.


724
00:38:50.635 --> 00:38:56.772
"Very tired, exhausted,
and you want to go home.


725
00:38:56.792 --> 00:38:58.814
"But you're not gonna go
home until you give up,


726
00:38:58.834 --> 00:39:01.792
till you say a story."

727
00:39:01.812 --> 00:39:04.570
They had made up a story
saying something like, ah,


728
00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.112
"Well, we have your
prints on her pants."


729
00:39:07.132 --> 00:39:09.353
I'm thinking, "How did
they take my prints"


730
00:39:09.373 --> 00:39:10.810
and put it on her pants?"

731
00:39:13.959 --> 00:39:16.247
Wise: Detective Nugent,
a young officer


732
00:39:16.267 --> 00:39:19.126
with a whole lot of
energy, came in.


733
00:39:19.146 --> 00:39:23.006
He put his face to my face.
Put his hand in my face.


734
00:39:23.026 --> 00:39:29.194
Grabbed my face, shook my face.
"I want a story from you."


735
00:39:29.214 --> 00:39:33.761
I just gave a written statement
just to satisfy them.


736
00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.992
Just to get them out of my
face with it and trying to be


737
00:39:37.144 --> 00:39:38.514
on my way out their buildin'.

738
00:39:40.958 --> 00:39:44.800
And afterwards, he
had me sign on it.


739
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.487
So, I signed on it. Yeah.

740
00:39:49.657 --> 00:39:53.374
These boys were in custody
and under varying


741
00:39:53.394 --> 00:39:58.046
degrees of interrogation for
a range of 14 to 30 hours.


742
00:39:58.066 --> 00:40:02.184
And when you are stressed,
when you are tired,


743
00:40:02.204 --> 00:40:06.353
when you are a juvenile and not
fully mature and developed,


744
00:40:06.373 --> 00:40:09.342
you're thinking, "Right now
I just want this to stop."


745
00:41:03.328 --> 00:41:04.845
Woman: My name is
Elizabeth Lederer.


746
00:41:04.865 --> 00:41:07.680
I'm an assistant district
attorney in New York county.


747
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.117
I'd like to ask you some
questions about a series of


748
00:41:11.137 --> 00:41:13.486
things that happened in
Central Park on the night of


749
00:41:13.506 --> 00:41:16.256
April 19 of 1989.

750
00:41:16.276 --> 00:41:18.458
Before I do that, I'd like
to, ah, advise you of your


751
00:41:18.478 --> 00:41:22.061
rights with respect to
statements you may make now, OK?


752
00:41:22.081 --> 00:41:23.496
You have the right
to remain silent


753
00:41:23.516 --> 00:41:25.198
and to refuse to
answer any questions.


754
00:41:25.218 --> 00:41:26.266
Do you understand?

755
00:41:26.286 --> 00:41:27.901
Yes, I do.

756
00:41:27.921 --> 00:41:28.901
Anything that you say

757
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:29.969
can be used against
you in court.


758
00:41:29.989 --> 00:41:30.969
Do you understand?

759
00:41:30.989 --> 00:41:32.305
Yes, I do.

760
00:41:32.325 --> 00:41:33.806
You have the right to
consult a lawyer now


761
00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:35.975
before any questioning and
have a lawyer present


762
00:41:35.995 --> 00:41:36.976
during any questioning.

763
00:41:36.996 --> 00:41:38.878
Do you understand?

764
00:41:38.898 --> 00:41:40.312
Could you please
answer out loud?


765
00:41:40.332 --> 00:41:41.446
Yes.

766
00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:42.581
If you have no lawyer

767
00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:44.717
or cannot afford a
lawyer, a lawyer will be


768
00:41:44.737 --> 00:41:47.185
provided for you now free of
charge before any questioning.


769
00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:48.253
Do you understand?

770
00:41:48.273 --> 00:41:50.756
Thank you. Yes.

771
00:41:50.776 --> 00:41:52.225
Now that I have advised
you of your rights,


772
00:41:52.245 --> 00:41:54.092
are you willing to tell me the
truth about what happened


773
00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:56.895
in Central Park on the
night of April 19 of 1989?


774
00:41:56.915 --> 00:41:58.463
Yes. Ok.

775
00:41:58.483 --> 00:42:01.634
Present in this room
is Detective Nugent,


776
00:42:01.654 --> 00:42:03.435
whom you have already
met, I believe...


777
00:42:03.455 --> 00:42:07.039
Wise: Detective Nugent
told me to, "Go in here."


778
00:42:07.059 --> 00:42:10.375
"You're gonna give this story
which you, which you has,


779
00:42:10.395 --> 00:42:12.611
"which you have said to me and
the rest of my coworkers,


780
00:42:12.631 --> 00:42:14.313
"you will go in here
and give the story.


781
00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:15.948
"I'm gonna be in the room.

782
00:42:15.968 --> 00:42:17.801
And I'm gonna make sure,
make sure you do it."


783
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.985
Lederer: This is
Detective McCabe


784
00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:22.487
and Detective Hildebrant.

785
00:42:22.507 --> 00:42:24.856
Ah, I think you've
already met them.


786
00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:28.427
Also present are, I
believe, your parents.


787
00:42:28.447 --> 00:42:32.496
Um, could you each please
state your full name?


788
00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.132
My name is Linda McCray.

789
00:42:34.152 --> 00:42:35.400
Bobby McCray.

790
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.201
And, ma'am, what
is your relation?


791
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.203
I'm his mother.

792
00:42:38.223 --> 00:42:39.438
And... his father.

793
00:42:39.458 --> 00:42:42.474
Ok. I want to warn you
of your rights with, ah,


794
00:42:42.494 --> 00:42:44.643
respect to anything you
say in this case...


795
00:42:44.663 --> 00:42:48.145
Why would a parent
not say at that moment,


796
00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:51.550
we want to consult
with an attorney?


797
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:56.388
The reason is because of the
setting and because of the way


798
00:42:56.408 --> 00:43:00.591
they're being treated by the
police and because of being


799
00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:03.628
overwhelmed by the situation.

800
00:43:03.648 --> 00:43:06.732
It doesn't even register
in their minds.


801
00:43:06.752 --> 00:43:07.965
Lederer: I just want
to state it is now


802
00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.800
20 minutes to 5:00
in the morning


803
00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.370
on the morning of
April 21 of 1989.


804
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.306
There is another gentleman
here in the room.


805
00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:16.374
Who is that man?

806
00:43:16.394 --> 00:43:17.375
My father.

807
00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:18.676
And, sir, could
you please just


808
00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:19.810
state your name and address.

809
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.145
Paul L. Richardson...

810
00:43:22.165 --> 00:43:26.117
Richardson: My father, he
was a quiet, stern man,


811
00:43:26.137 --> 00:43:29.619
so..

812
00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:34.724
I felt ashamed that I was
even there doing that.


813
00:43:34.744 --> 00:43:38.828
And I shouldn't feel that
way because I was innocent.


814
00:43:38.848 --> 00:43:40.797
Lederer: ...Also present
in the room right now


815
00:43:40.817 --> 00:43:43.800
are Detective Arroyo and
Detective Sheehan...


816
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.102
Santana, Jr.: I was under
the impression that


817
00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:48.772
I was going to be a witness,
help out, or just give 'em


818
00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:50.074
the story and that was it.

819
00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.875
Lederer: Sir, could you
please give your name?


820
00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.910
My name is Raymond Santana.

821
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.678
Santana, Jr.: I didn't
think about consequences.


822
00:43:55.698 --> 00:43:57.047
I didn't think about anything.

823
00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:58.748
The only thing that
I thought about was


824
00:43:58.768 --> 00:44:00.784
he was gonna make
sure I go home.


825
00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:02.685
That was it.

826
00:44:02.705 --> 00:44:04.020
Lederer: I'm gonna ask
you a few questions...


827
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.623
Richardson: Here I
am doing a videotape


828
00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:14.364
and I'm already deep in this so
I'm thinking now I gotta sell it


829
00:44:14.384 --> 00:44:18.201
to make sure that people
know that I wasn't involved.


830
00:44:18.221 --> 00:44:20.102
Lederer: Were you
trying to touch her?


831
00:44:20.122 --> 00:44:21.171
Not really.

832
00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:22.472
Didn't you tell the
police earlier today


833
00:44:22.492 --> 00:44:23.840
that you had tried to grab her

834
00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.608
and that's when you
got scratched?


835
00:44:25.628 --> 00:44:27.177
No, not like,

836
00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:28.744
like feeling her,
feeling her up.


837
00:44:28.764 --> 00:44:30.245
Ok. Not like that?
Trying to stop it.


838
00:44:30.265 --> 00:44:32.881
But you tried, you...

839
00:44:32.901 --> 00:44:34.616
To grab, like, grab the
arms or something.


840
00:44:34.636 --> 00:44:35.851
You tried to grab her arms?

841
00:44:35.871 --> 00:44:37.853
I was trying to stop it.

842
00:44:37.873 --> 00:44:39.421
Did you see Antron have
intercourse with her?


843
00:44:39.441 --> 00:44:40.423
Yes.

844
00:44:40.443 --> 00:44:41.623
Was he laying on top of her,

845
00:44:41.643 --> 00:44:43.526
or was he kneeling, or was he?

846
00:44:43.546 --> 00:44:45.028
Laying on top of her.

847
00:44:45.048 --> 00:44:48.063
Ok. And how long was
he on top of her?


848
00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:50.499
For a short while,
then Raymond,


849
00:44:50.519 --> 00:44:52.434
then Raymond went.

850
00:44:52.454 --> 00:44:53.536
We was headed to
the West Side.


851
00:44:53.556 --> 00:44:55.271
That's when I seen Kevin.

852
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:57.574
That's where you saw Kevin?

853
00:44:57.594 --> 00:44:58.874
Was anybody with Kevin?

854
00:44:58.894 --> 00:45:01.577
Yeah, a lady.

855
00:45:01.597 --> 00:45:02.578
Who was with Kevin?

856
00:45:02.598 --> 00:45:03.612
Some lady.

857
00:45:03.632 --> 00:45:06.148
A lady? Mm-hmm.

858
00:45:06.168 --> 00:45:07.382
How was she dressed?

859
00:45:07.402 --> 00:45:09.818
I couldn't tell.
It was too dark.


860
00:45:09.838 --> 00:45:11.120
What was he doing with her?

861
00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.488
Struggling with her.

862
00:45:12.508 --> 00:45:13.889
What were the others
doing while Kevin


863
00:45:13.909 --> 00:45:16.058
was struggling with
her, with the wrists?


864
00:45:16.078 --> 00:45:17.592
Antron was going
for her clothes


865
00:45:17.612 --> 00:45:20.662
and Lopez was
holding her arms.


866
00:45:20.682 --> 00:45:23.065
What was Kevin
doing while, um,


867
00:45:23.085 --> 00:45:24.566
Steve Lopez was
holding her hands


868
00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:25.567
and hitting her
with the brick?


869
00:45:25.587 --> 00:45:27.702
He was having sex with her.

870
00:45:27.722 --> 00:45:28.870
Where were you standing?

871
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:31.140
I was on the side of Kevin.

872
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.874
Were you watching?

873
00:45:32.894 --> 00:45:35.127
No, I was grabbing
the lady's...


874
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:40.181
Who else had sex with her
besides Kevin Richardson?


875
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:42.902
I didn't see anybody else
who had sex, just him.


876
00:45:45.105 --> 00:45:48.055
Did somebody have
sex with her?


877
00:45:48.075 --> 00:45:49.090
Yeah.

878
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.459
Did a lot of people
have sex with her?


879
00:45:51.479 --> 00:45:52.960
Yeah. First it was
the black guy,


880
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.595
then it was the Puerto Rican
guy with the black hood?


881
00:45:54.615 --> 00:45:56.515
Then you got on top of her?

882
00:45:59.819 --> 00:46:01.302
Lederer: What's
in that picture?


883
00:46:01.322 --> 00:46:02.303
Wise: It's her.

884
00:46:02.323 --> 00:46:03.371
Is that the woman
that you saw?


885
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:05.239
Yes.

886
00:46:05.259 --> 00:46:06.274
Is that sort of the
way she looked


887
00:46:06.294 --> 00:46:07.275
when you saw her?

888
00:46:07.295 --> 00:46:09.328
Yes, yes, ma'am.

889
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.716
Did you see anybody
hit her with the,


890
00:46:16.736 --> 00:46:18.270
with anything but their hands?

891
00:46:21.374 --> 00:46:23.156
I seen... And I'm
telling you, Korey...


892
00:46:23.176 --> 00:46:25.325
I don't want you to think that

893
00:46:25.345 --> 00:46:26.994
you have to say that,

894
00:46:27.014 --> 00:46:29.563
but I want to
know what you saw


895
00:46:29.583 --> 00:46:32.717
that explains how she
got so badly hurt.


896
00:46:36.122 --> 00:46:42.342
I did see Kevin pick
up a, a hand rock,


897
00:46:42.362 --> 00:46:47.714
a small hand rock, and hit
her across the face with it.


898
00:46:47.734 --> 00:46:49.182
How big was the rock?

899
00:46:49.202 --> 00:46:55.655
It was a hand, about that
big, like, it was nice,


900
00:46:55.675 --> 00:46:58.391
it was big, it was a
good-shaped rock.


901
00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:00.478
Hit her across like that.

902
00:47:05.317 --> 00:47:06.967
Are you just saying
that because I...


903
00:47:06.987 --> 00:47:08.567
No. Uh, uh, no. I
am asking you.


904
00:47:08.587 --> 00:47:09.970
Why didn't you say it before?

905
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:11.904
- Huh?
- Why didn't you say it before?


906
00:47:11.924 --> 00:47:13.505
Because I remember I was,

907
00:47:13.525 --> 00:47:15.275
me taking a quick
glance in the dark.


908
00:47:15.295 --> 00:47:17.611
I remember him
picking up a rock


909
00:47:17.631 --> 00:47:20.646
from out the, out the dirt.

910
00:47:20.666 --> 00:47:22.581
Woman: Why did you tell them
something that wasn't true,


911
00:47:22.601 --> 00:47:24.168
that you hadn't seen?

912
00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.257
I guess... I would
strongly guess


913
00:47:30.277 --> 00:47:33.559
just to save my own life.

914
00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:36.161
To get out, get out,
get outta there


915
00:47:36.181 --> 00:47:38.564
as quickly as I, I
can as possible


916
00:47:38.584 --> 00:47:42.234
because I been there
too long as it was.


917
00:47:42.254 --> 00:47:44.336
And, you know, bein' a kid

918
00:47:44.356 --> 00:47:47.072
I never experienced
that in my life.


919
00:47:47.092 --> 00:47:48.107
How old were you?

920
00:47:48.127 --> 00:47:49.642
16.

921
00:47:49.662 --> 00:47:54.480
16 and I felt like
I was about 12.


922
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.248
Lederer: Did you tell us
the truth voluntarily?


923
00:47:56.268 --> 00:47:57.483
Yes, ma'am.

924
00:47:57.503 --> 00:47:58.683
Because you wanted to?
Yes, ma'am.


925
00:47:58.703 --> 00:47:59.685
Did anyone force you?

926
00:47:59.705 --> 00:48:00.686
No, ma'am.

927
00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:01.786
Did anyone threaten you?

928
00:48:01.806 --> 00:48:03.322
No.

929
00:48:03.342 --> 00:48:05.391
Thank you very much. It is now

930
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:09.627
20 minutes to 4:00 and the
interview is concluded.


931
00:48:09.647 --> 00:48:12.697
Detective: Hey. Sit down...

932
00:48:12.717 --> 00:48:14.098
Got to get you to
sign something, eh?


933
00:48:14.118 --> 00:48:15.284
Huh?

934
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:20.004
Santana, Jr.: They
put us in the cell


935
00:48:20.024 --> 00:48:21.906
with the rest of the guys.

936
00:48:21.926 --> 00:48:24.877
Now there's all these guys that
I don't even know, you know.


937
00:48:24.897 --> 00:48:27.245
Who are you, you know?
And, um...


938
00:48:27.265 --> 00:48:28.680
And everybody's
asking each other.


939
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.481
You know, "Well,
what did you say?"


940
00:48:30.501 --> 00:48:31.884
What did you say?"

941
00:48:31.904 --> 00:48:33.985
And everybody's
basically saying,


942
00:48:34.005 --> 00:48:36.220
"Well, I told 'em I
was with my boy.


943
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.223
And we left. I
didn't see nothing."


944
00:48:39.243 --> 00:48:41.292
Nobody's saying what
they actually said.


945
00:48:41.312 --> 00:48:44.829
Everybody had that sense of don't
let it out the bag because


946
00:48:44.849 --> 00:48:48.583
if I let it out then
I'm not gonna go home.


947
00:48:52.621 --> 00:48:54.639
Woman: In New York City
this morning, a jogger is


948
00:48:54.659 --> 00:48:57.575
fighting for her life after a
brutal attack in Central Park.


949
00:48:57.595 --> 00:48:59.644
Woman: Viciously battered
and unconscious,


950
00:48:59.664 --> 00:49:03.147
wearing only a jogging bra, her
hands tied over her mouth.


951
00:49:03.167 --> 00:49:05.949
Woman: The suspects are

952
00:49:05.969 --> 00:49:08.419
who blazed a nighttime
trail of terror.


953
00:49:08.439 --> 00:49:10.054
Assaulting an elderly man,

954
00:49:10.074 --> 00:49:13.358
attacking a male runner, hitting
another person with a lead pipe.


955
00:49:13.378 --> 00:49:15.726
At one time, the group
was running in a pack of


956
00:49:15.746 --> 00:49:17.494
more than 25 youths.

957
00:49:17.514 --> 00:49:19.629
Woman: The victim is now
in critical condition


958
00:49:19.649 --> 00:49:20.631
at Metropolitan Hospital.

959
00:49:20.651 --> 00:49:21.899
Two skull fractures,

960
00:49:21.919 --> 00:49:24.935
a significant loss of blood,
and advanced hypothermia.


961
00:49:24.955 --> 00:49:26.604
Woman: If she lives,
it's likely she'll


962
00:49:26.624 --> 00:49:27.738
suffer from brain damage.

963
00:49:27.758 --> 00:49:30.507
8 suspects were
arraigned this weekend,


964
00:49:30.527 --> 00:49:32.476
aged 14 to 17.

965
00:49:32.496 --> 00:49:33.577
Jennings: Some of the
young men told police


966
00:49:33.597 --> 00:49:36.346
they were just out wilding.

967
00:49:36.366 --> 00:49:39.000
Woman: Wilding is a word you
won't find in Webster's.


968
00:49:39.054 --> 00:49:41.062
Wilding. New York
city police say


969
00:49:41.082 --> 00:49:44.802
that's new teenage slang for
rampaging in wolfpacks,


970
00:49:44.822 --> 00:49:47.044
attacking people just
for the fun of it.


971
00:49:47.064 --> 00:49:48.254
The district
attorney's office says


972
00:49:48.274 --> 00:49:50.319
the teenagers have confessed.

973
00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:54.147
The spokesman said some of those
confessions are on videotape.


974
00:49:55.518 --> 00:49:59.920
Koch: A woman jogging
and Central Park.


975
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.824
Central park was holy.

976
00:50:02.844 --> 00:50:06.735
If it had happened any place
else other than Central Park,


977
00:50:06.755 --> 00:50:08.471
it would have been terrible,

978
00:50:08.491 --> 00:50:11.728
but it would not have
been as terrible.


979
00:50:14.742 --> 00:50:18.335
It was for everybody,
not just me,


980
00:50:18.355 --> 00:50:20.166
the crime of the century.

981
00:50:27.616 --> 00:50:30.536
During this whole process
we were inside the precinct.


982
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.569
I had no clue what was
going on on the outside.


983
00:50:36.274 --> 00:50:37.887
Can you stop to talk to
us for a couple seconds?


984
00:50:37.907 --> 00:50:39.466
Tell us what's going to happen now?

985
00:50:39.486 --> 00:50:43.438
They said, "Oh, yeah, the news got
a little bit ahold of this story so..."


986
00:50:43.635 --> 00:50:45.607
there might be some reporters outside."

987
00:50:45.627 --> 00:50:48.264
"You know, just don't pay them
any attention. Just keep walking."


988
00:50:53.052 --> 00:50:55.136
Colangelo: Today we are
announcing the arrests of


989
00:50:55.156 --> 00:51:00.371
4 males, all between 14 and 15
years of age, in connection with


990
00:51:00.391 --> 00:51:04.054
the April 19 attempted
murder, rape, and assault


991
00:51:04.074 --> 00:51:06.385
of a female in Central Park.

992
00:51:06.629 --> 00:51:09.162
"They got 'em!" That
was the, uh, feelings.


993
00:51:09.182 --> 00:51:13.087
"Thank God, uh, for Ben
Ward and the NYPD.


994
00:51:13.107 --> 00:51:14.196
They got 'em!"

995
00:51:16.137 --> 00:51:19.177
Kassin: Set against the
backdrop of New York City


996
00:51:19.197 --> 00:51:22.369
and a crime that just about
has everybody flipping out,


997
00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:25.604
you can only imagine
the pressure that NYPD


998
00:51:25.624 --> 00:51:28.910
was under to have this crime
solved and solved quickly.


999
00:51:29.679 --> 00:51:31.390
Dwyer: Jack Maple, one
of the architects of


1000
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:34.866
the 1990s New York city
police revolution,


1001
00:51:35.127 --> 00:51:38.842
once told me that he
remembered seeing detectives


1002
00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:43.998
involved in the Central Park
jogger case in Elaine's


1003
00:51:44.181 --> 00:51:46.661
within a day or
so of the crime,


1004
00:51:46.822 --> 00:51:48.944
celebrating the arrests.

1005
00:51:49.735 --> 00:51:54.669
There was a sense that
this had been a home run


1006
00:51:55.054 --> 00:51:57.233
from a law enforcement
standpoint.


1007
00:52:06.833 --> 00:52:09.640
When they chained us up to
go to another precinct,


1008
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.332
pictures snapping.

1009
00:52:12.139 --> 00:52:14.412
Me and Yusef did
the walk together


1010
00:52:14.597 --> 00:52:16.604
and we just kept our head down.

1011
00:52:17.008 --> 00:52:19.965
When we saw the lights we,
we still didn't know.


1012
00:52:19.985 --> 00:52:21.365
We still didn't understand.

1013
00:52:22.141 --> 00:52:23.915
Richardson: I'm walking
and I'm scared


1014
00:52:23.935 --> 00:52:25.023
but I had my head up high.

1015
00:52:25.043 --> 00:52:28.827
And all I think to myself, "OK,
the truth is going to come out."


1016
00:52:30.901 --> 00:52:33.633
Dwyer: After they got out
of the interrogation room,


1017
00:52:33.748 --> 00:52:34.752
they backed off.

1018
00:52:34.935 --> 00:52:37.654
Each one of them
denied having done it.


1019
00:52:38.002 --> 00:52:40.237
Consistently, again
and again and again.


1020
00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.583
They said, "No,
we didn't do it."


1021
00:52:43.198 --> 00:52:45.224
For the first time
since the April 19


1022
00:52:45.244 --> 00:52:48.759
rampage through Central Park,
Manhattan D.A. Robert Morgenthau


1023
00:52:48.779 --> 00:52:51.661
spoke out publicly on the
attacks to officially announce


1024
00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:53.772
indictments involving

1025
00:52:53.792 --> 00:52:56.192
charged with the
most serious crimes.


1026
00:52:56.212 --> 00:52:57.758
Morgenthau: Each is
charged in this attack


1027
00:52:57.778 --> 00:53:00.932
with attempted murder,
rape in the first degree,


1028
00:53:00.952 --> 00:53:02.919
sodomy in the first degree,

1029
00:53:02.939 --> 00:53:04.663
sexual abuse in
the first degree,


1030
00:53:04.683 --> 00:53:06.830
two counts of assault
in the first degree,


1031
00:53:06.986 --> 00:53:09.104
and riot in the first degree.

1032
00:53:43.469 --> 00:53:46.182
Hancock: There's no
way that I as a woman


1033
00:53:46.202 --> 00:53:51.196
could not feel horrible for her
and feel scared for myself


1034
00:53:51.216 --> 00:53:53.661
and every other woman
walking the street.


1035
00:53:54.173 --> 00:53:57.731
And I was on the edge of my seat
hoping that she would get better


1036
00:53:57.751 --> 00:54:01.558
but there was no indication that
she would recover consciousness.


1037
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:09.746
Byfield: For me, the one
piece of information


1038
00:54:09.766 --> 00:54:12.761
that just got me was
her friends coming in


1039
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:14.817
to identify her and
her being just


1040
00:54:14.837 --> 00:54:16.002
beaten beyond recognition.

1041
00:54:16.169 --> 00:54:19.944
And the only way that her
friends could identify her


1042
00:54:19.964 --> 00:54:22.893
was by a ring that she wore.

1043
00:54:41.282 --> 00:54:43.778
The 28-year-old
victim lies in a coma.


1044
00:54:43.798 --> 00:54:46.003
A teacher called
her "golden girl,"


1045
00:54:46.023 --> 00:54:48.877
an investment banker with
a blue-chip background


1046
00:54:48.897 --> 00:54:52.060
whose savage beating and gang
rape has provoked outrage


1047
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.707
in a city famous
for indifference.


1048
00:54:54.727 --> 00:54:57.383
Suspects in the crime were
arraigned this weekend,


1049
00:54:57.403 --> 00:54:59.736
aged 14 to 17.

1050
00:54:59.756 --> 00:55:01.285
Lederer: Rape in
the first degree;


1051
00:55:01.305 --> 00:55:02.919
sodomy in the first degree;

1052
00:55:02.939 --> 00:55:04.642
sexual abuse in the
first degree...


1053
00:55:04.662 --> 00:55:07.177
We was at arraignment and, um,

1054
00:55:07.197 --> 00:55:09.741
I remember them
reading charges off...


1055
00:55:09.761 --> 00:55:11.994
robbery in the first, attempted
murder in the first,


1056
00:55:12.014 --> 00:55:13.346
rape in the first.

1057
00:55:13.366 --> 00:55:15.262
And the lawyer was like,
"Don't say anything.


1058
00:55:15.282 --> 00:55:16.191
Just keep your head down."

1059
00:55:16.211 --> 00:55:17.656
Lederer: ...That he
had her by the legs,


1060
00:55:17.676 --> 00:55:20.332
and that he raped her after
defendant Santana did.


1061
00:55:20.352 --> 00:55:22.154
But it wasn't until

1062
00:55:22.174 --> 00:55:26.174
you got into that jail and,
and you felt the impact.


1063
00:55:28.206 --> 00:55:31.033
McCray: Spofford
Juvenile Detention.


1064
00:55:31.318 --> 00:55:34.431
You had kids that
committed serious crimes.


1065
00:55:35.779 --> 00:55:37.788
Murder, rape.

1066
00:55:39.947 --> 00:55:41.463
Santana, Jr.: This
counselor came down,


1067
00:55:41.585 --> 00:55:42.900
he sat there with us.

1068
00:55:43.105 --> 00:55:47.148
And he said, "You know, you know
how serious y'all case is?"


1069
00:55:47.834 --> 00:55:50.652
And we was like, "What
are you talking about?"


1070
00:55:51.131 --> 00:55:54.058
And he said, "You all,
y'all over the paper."


1071
00:55:54.078 --> 00:55:56.154
"Y'all in every news station.

1072
00:55:56.512 --> 00:55:58.240
Everybody's talkin'
about y'all."


1073
00:55:58.568 --> 00:56:02.080
He said, "It's so serious the
whole jail want to get you."


1074
00:56:06.461 --> 00:56:08.207
Salaam: Because he was 16,

1075
00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.431
they sent Korey
to Rikers Island.


1076
00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.201
Rikers Island would
make Spofford...


1077
00:56:17.059 --> 00:56:18.642
Look like a country club,

1078
00:56:21.095 --> 00:56:23.358
'specially when you're in there

1079
00:56:23.378 --> 00:56:24.561
for a rape charge.

1080
00:56:25.579 --> 00:56:28.470
To be a child, to
be 16 years old


1081
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:32.123
and to be in an adult facility,
I can't imagine that.


1082
00:56:34.085 --> 00:56:38.808
Rikers Island at
the age of 16.


1083
00:56:40.474 --> 00:56:45.066
Bein' forced to
grow up very fast.


1084
00:56:52.633 --> 00:56:54.999
Byfield: In the first few
days after the incident,


1085
00:56:55.142 --> 00:56:57.687
the narrative that
came out was that


1086
00:56:57.875 --> 00:56:59.922
these young men were guilty.

1087
00:57:00.407 --> 00:57:03.121
And it was almost unquestioned.

1088
00:57:04.228 --> 00:57:07.671
Koch: When parents or
grandmothers, ahh,


1089
00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:10.818
of some of these, ah,
alleged perpetrators...


1090
00:57:10.838 --> 00:57:15.007
we always have to say alleged
because that's the requirement.


1091
00:57:17.002 --> 00:57:19.716
When those grandmothers
say, "But he's a good boy."


1092
00:57:20.307 --> 00:57:21.970
He never did anything."

1093
00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:23.336
Don't you believe it!

1094
00:57:23.356 --> 00:57:25.132
Black: There was so much hate.

1095
00:57:25.669 --> 00:57:27.322
We couldn't watch TV.

1096
00:57:27.342 --> 00:57:29.275
There's something wrong
with the parenting


1097
00:57:29.295 --> 00:57:32.092
and the families and the
home life of our city.


1098
00:57:32.112 --> 00:57:34.479
It's an outrage. It's, it's...

1099
00:57:35.512 --> 00:57:36.846
The violence in this city,

1100
00:57:36.866 --> 00:57:38.311
the quality of
life in this city,


1101
00:57:38.331 --> 00:57:39.447
is getting worse and worse.

1102
00:57:39.467 --> 00:57:45.910
This is the, the, mm, the
ultimate shriek of alarm.


1103
00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:49.114
This is the ultimate siren
that says none of us is safe.


1104
00:57:49.134 --> 00:57:51.105
The story has enraged
many New Yorkers,


1105
00:57:51.125 --> 00:57:53.725
startled others, and
started renewed talk of


1106
00:57:53.745 --> 00:57:56.419
an under-policed city with
crime out of control.


1107
00:57:56.439 --> 00:58:01.964
Mayor Koch said, "This will
be a test of the system."


1108
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:07.151
People want to see how the,
ah, criminal justice system


1109
00:58:07.171 --> 00:58:09.334
works, or if it works.

1110
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:11.907
Woman: The brutal attack on
the young investment banker


1111
00:58:11.927 --> 00:58:14.380
is fueling a new battle
for the death penalty,


1112
00:58:14.502 --> 00:58:17.822
even though as the proposed law
now stands, it would only apply


1113
00:58:17.842 --> 00:58:19.337
to those 18 or older.

1114
00:58:19.450 --> 00:58:20.802
Woman: I'm for the
death penalty.


1115
00:58:20.822 --> 00:58:23.877
If someone were to hurt
my family or a loved one


1116
00:58:23.897 --> 00:58:25.896
as they did this woman,

1117
00:58:25.916 --> 00:58:27.739
I would probably want them dead.

1118
00:58:27.759 --> 00:58:30.379
You better believe
that I hate the people


1119
00:58:30.614 --> 00:58:33.618
that took this girl and
raped her brutally.


1120
00:58:33.638 --> 00:58:34.801
You better believe it.

1121
00:58:34.821 --> 00:58:37.589
Woman: Trump put his money where
his mouth is by taking out


1122
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:41.412
this full-page ad in 4 New
York City newspapers.


1123
00:58:41.554 --> 00:58:43.562
"Bring back the death penalty."

1124
00:58:43.722 --> 00:58:47.478
Trump's ads underscore a fierce debate
going on right now in New York.


1125
00:58:47.581 --> 00:58:52.500
According to a recent Gallop pole a
full 76% of all New York City residents


1126
00:58:52.604 --> 00:58:55.383
favor executing some convicted criminals.

1127
00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.216
Byfield: They were children.

1128
00:59:00.582 --> 00:59:02.018
They were children.

1129
00:59:02.469 --> 00:59:05.113
Bringing up the death penalty
in the context of the case


1130
00:59:05.133 --> 00:59:09.321
in which you were discussing
children was outrageous to me.


1131
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:11.500
I think that if she had
been a wa... young woman


1132
00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:17.631
who, ah, who had been found in
an alley in Bedford-Stuyvesant;


1133
00:59:17.968 --> 00:59:21.366
if she had been
found, ah, in Harlem;


1134
00:59:21.507 --> 00:59:26.493
ah, if she had been found in any
of the, any of the, ah, ah,


1135
00:59:26.513 --> 00:59:30.291
darker enclaves in this
city or in this state,


1136
00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:33.418
Donald trump wouldn't have
spoken, he, he wouldn't have


1137
00:59:33.438 --> 00:59:35.156
even whispered a word.

1138
00:59:35.559 --> 00:59:38.487
Interracial rapes are
covered differently.


1139
00:59:39.031 --> 00:59:42.718
And there was another major
rape in the city at the time.


1140
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.901
And this is the woman who
was raped in Brooklyn


1141
00:59:45.921 --> 00:59:47.663
and thrown off a rooftop.

1142
00:59:47.683 --> 00:59:50.022
That got little to no coverage

1143
00:59:50.042 --> 00:59:52.342
because the assailants
and the victim


1144
00:59:52.577 --> 00:59:54.661
were in the same racial group.

1145
00:59:55.727 --> 00:59:59.246
If there's a white woman and
the accusation is that she's


1146
00:59:59.266 --> 01:00:02.930
been done-in by blacks, that
by itself takes you back


1147
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:07.551
to Emmett Till, who did nothing
but whistle at a woman


1148
01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:11.541
and ended up in a shallow
Mississippi grave.


1149
01:00:12.751 --> 01:00:19.419
If this had happened in 1901,
they would have been lynched,


1150
01:00:20.123 --> 01:00:24.671
perhaps castrated, and their
bodies burned and that


1151
01:00:24.691 --> 01:00:26.071
would have been the end of it.

1152
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:28.451
But this was New
York City, 1989.


1153
01:00:28.471 --> 01:00:31.176
It was not Jim Crow South.

1154
01:00:31.196 --> 01:00:33.765
And yet the same words are
being used with the same


1155
01:00:33.785 --> 01:00:35.373
damaging results.

1156
01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:40.962
Butts: They seized on the
fears of the people.


1157
01:00:40.982 --> 01:00:42.102
Wilding.

1158
01:00:42.122 --> 01:00:46.747
The bestial characterization
of the black man, these young


1159
01:00:46.767 --> 01:00:49.285
hoodlums, these thugs.

1160
01:00:51.911 --> 01:00:56.024
Wilder: Once we were on the path
to identifying these young men


1161
01:00:56.044 --> 01:00:59.827
as the culprits, it's hard
to get off that path.


1162
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:05.320
And race, power, and politics
make it extremely difficult.


1163
01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.183
It requires extraordinary courage.

1164
01:01:08.435 --> 01:01:11.383
A lot of people in the
black community went along


1165
01:01:11.403 --> 01:01:13.297
with the confessions.

1166
01:01:14.555 --> 01:01:18.048
Many of us were frightened
by our own children.


1167
01:01:18.536 --> 01:01:26.442
Many of us had been pushed
around, raped, burglarized,


1168
01:01:26.837 --> 01:01:30.110
pocketbooks snatched,
harassed on the subway


1169
01:01:30.694 --> 01:01:32.844
often by young black men.

1170
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:38.708
People just said,
"Oh, how terrible.


1171
01:01:39.187 --> 01:01:40.361
How terrible."

1172
01:01:40.915 --> 01:01:43.639
Everyone turned against
them, except a few.


1173
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.629
Woman: The good news is, she
continues to improve neurologically


1174
01:01:52.649 --> 01:01:54.100
from her attack.

1175
01:01:54.948 --> 01:01:57.642
For the first time, she
called her father "Dad."


1176
01:01:57.754 --> 01:01:59.333
She did simple arithmetic.

1177
01:01:59.353 --> 01:02:01.885
Her brain is working, still
abnormally... she thought


1178
01:02:01.905 --> 01:02:05.791
the year was 1952... but
her brain is working.


1179
01:02:06.044 --> 01:02:10.731
She's getting better, and
so far she looks good.


1180
01:02:10.853 --> 01:02:13.541
Woman: The medical case
of the 28-year-old jogger


1181
01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:15.168
continues to improve.

1182
01:02:15.188 --> 01:02:17.825
She is undergoing physical
and psychological therapy


1183
01:02:17.845 --> 01:02:19.254
at a Connecticut hospital.

1184
01:02:19.274 --> 01:02:21.844
The young woman attacked has
apparently made a remarkable


1185
01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:25.000
recovery, although she
reportedly cannot recall any


1186
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.710
details about the attack.

1187
01:02:43.787 --> 01:02:46.340
McCray: When I was bailed out,
I thought the case was over.


1188
01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.833
I thought the truth came out.

1189
01:02:47.853 --> 01:02:51.153
I didn't know nothing about
bail until I got home.


1190
01:02:51.173 --> 01:02:53.709
My mother explained to me, "No, it's bail.
We paid for you to get out."


1191
01:02:53.729 --> 01:02:55.410
We still got to
go on with this."


1192
01:02:58.030 --> 01:02:59.532
I wasn't able to go to school,

1193
01:02:59.552 --> 01:03:01.238
so I got a tutor.

1194
01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:03.449
I didn't go outside a lot.

1195
01:03:04.202 --> 01:03:07.915
I stayed in the house, played
video games, and just studied.


1196
01:03:11.495 --> 01:03:13.947
Hancock: The police controlled
the story from the beginning.


1197
01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:18.872
They created the story and the
theory, and all the pieces


1198
01:03:18.892 --> 01:03:19.686
fell into place.

1199
01:03:19.946 --> 01:03:23.965
The authorities release a
chronology to the press


1200
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:27.308
of what this wilding
was all about.


1201
01:03:27.328 --> 01:03:29.996
Together at about

1202
01:03:30.256 --> 01:03:32.790
Dwyer: The newspapers
love chronologies.


1203
01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.114
We call 'em tick-tocks.

1204
01:03:34.134 --> 01:03:38.001
We like to say, "Here's how
this night of terror unfolded"


1205
01:03:38.021 --> 01:03:38.754
in the park."

1206
01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:42.374
At 8:55, they
attacked an older male.


1207
01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:47.997
The timeline says the kids did these attacks
at this place with the homeless guy,


1208
01:03:48.017 --> 01:03:50.506
at this place with the taxi
driver, over there with


1209
01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:53.698
the bicycle rider, and
then with people running


1210
01:03:53.718 --> 01:03:54.909
around the reservoir.

1211
01:03:54.929 --> 01:03:55.878
At 9:25...

1212
01:03:55.898 --> 01:04:00.170
They did various acts of malice
or mischief with these folks.


1213
01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.508
Now, those people reported
these things either


1214
01:04:04.528 --> 01:04:07.889
simultaneously or right
after to the police.


1215
01:04:07.909 --> 01:04:11.269
So there is a
clear-cut timeline.


1216
01:04:12.903 --> 01:04:17.174
And what they do is they
append to the end of this


1217
01:04:17.194 --> 01:04:20.729
sequence of crimes the
attack on the jogger.


1218
01:04:21.217 --> 01:04:23.249
Then something happens.

1219
01:04:23.509 --> 01:04:28.288
Her movements that night
start to become defined.


1220
01:04:29.026 --> 01:04:32.895
And all of a sudden we find out
when she left her house,...


1221
01:04:32.915 --> 01:04:35.687
What route she normally
took around the park.


1222
01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:39.620
And with not necessarily
absolute certainty,


1223
01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.844
but with a good degree of
certainty you can figure out


1224
01:04:43.864 --> 01:04:47.005
that Trisha Meili should
have been in the park


1225
01:04:47.136 --> 01:04:51.960
around the place where she was
attacked at around 20 after 9:00.


1226
01:04:52.927 --> 01:04:57.471
We know for certain that at
that time, those kids were


1227
01:04:57.491 --> 01:05:02.073
beating up, hassling other
people on the reservoir,


1228
01:05:02.214 --> 01:05:04.326
South of that
spot in the park.


1229
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:08.840
They weren't at that part of
the park at the time she would


1230
01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:10.194
have been there.

1231
01:05:10.214 --> 01:05:15.015
And if you watch the videotape
confessions, it turns out they


1232
01:05:15.035 --> 01:05:17.366
actually don't know where
the crime took place;


1233
01:05:17.386 --> 01:05:19.632
they don't know
when it took place;


1234
01:05:19.652 --> 01:05:21.077
and they don't know
how it took place.


1235
01:05:21.097 --> 01:05:22.836
They just know
that it happened.


1236
01:05:26.407 --> 01:05:30.976
Kassin: The problem is, once you form
a strong belief that somebody is


1237
01:05:30.996 --> 01:05:33.204
guilty of a crime,

1238
01:05:33.224 --> 01:05:35.133
the contradictory
details are just that.


1239
01:05:35.153 --> 01:05:38.192
They're details but they
don't fundamentally


1240
01:05:38.212 --> 01:05:40.304
change our belief
in their guilt.


1241
01:05:42.866 --> 01:05:46.205
But when the DNA results
come back and none of their


1242
01:05:46.225 --> 01:05:50.794
DNA is present, that should
have stopped the investigation


1243
01:05:50.815 --> 01:05:53.454
in its tracks and they should
have at least paused and moved


1244
01:05:53.474 --> 01:05:55.815
in another direction.

1245
01:05:55.835 --> 01:05:59.672
Warren: Harlan Levy was a
DNA prosecutor at the time.


1246
01:05:59.692 --> 01:06:04.926
And he recalls how Elizabeth Lederer
said, "Please, come to my office."


1247
01:06:04.946 --> 01:06:07.519
And he could sense
urgency in her voice.


1248
01:06:07.539 --> 01:06:10.146
And she said, "Look, I
feel like I've been kicked"


1249
01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.141
"in the stomach.

1250
01:06:12.161 --> 01:06:14.568
"There's no DNA
match whatsoever


1251
01:06:14.588 --> 01:06:17.163
to any of these boys."

1252
01:06:17.183 --> 01:06:20.320
Kassin: It is improbable, given
the nature of this crime


1253
01:06:20.341 --> 01:06:24.344
and the scene, that these boys
would not have left a single


1254
01:06:24.364 --> 01:06:28.367
trace of themselves on the scene or
the scene a single trace on them.


1255
01:06:28.387 --> 01:06:32.823
The improbability of
that is striking.


1256
01:06:32.843 --> 01:06:36.481
But the decision was we can
still prosecute this case.


1257
01:06:36.501 --> 01:06:39.407
And the argument we will make
to the jury is just because we


1258
01:06:39.427 --> 01:06:42.333
didn't get all of them,
doesn't mean we didn't get


1259
01:06:42.353 --> 01:06:43.281
some of them.

1260
01:06:45.244 --> 01:06:49.581
They now created a scenario by
which there is a 6th perpetrator


1261
01:06:49.602 --> 01:06:51.377
a 6th perpetrator
who mysteriously


1262
01:06:51.397 --> 01:06:55.101
doesn't appear in any
of the confessions.


1263
01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:58.559
But even if they were correct,
that 6th perpetrator's


1264
01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:01.253
absence in their confessions
makes the confessions


1265
01:07:01.273 --> 01:07:03.266
factually incorrect.

1266
01:07:04.597 --> 01:07:07.504
That should have
been the dilemma.


1267
01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:12.457
Dwyer: The trail in the grass at the
very spot where she was taken down


1268
01:07:12.477 --> 01:07:16.448
is 18 inches wide, that wide.

1269
01:07:16.468 --> 01:07:21.635
You can't tell me that 5 kids
or 10 or whatever the number is


1270
01:07:21.655 --> 01:07:23.597
that were supposedly
involved in this wilding


1271
01:07:23.617 --> 01:07:29.881
dragged this woman off the road
and left an 18-inch-wide trail.


1272
01:07:29.901 --> 01:07:36.465
That trail was a photograph of
the beginning of this attack.


1273
01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:41.553
And in that picture there are
not 5 kids, there are only


1274
01:07:41.573 --> 01:07:46.043
2 people: The victim
and her assailant.


1275
01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:09.004
Reyes: I asked her
to get undressed.


1276
01:08:09.489 --> 01:08:12.243
When she was coming towards
me, I picked up the knife.


1277
01:08:13.161 --> 01:08:16.747
And I shoved the knife
and I caught her hair.


1278
01:08:17.236 --> 01:08:19.301
And she was saying,
"Ah, you stabbed me."


1279
01:08:19.452 --> 01:08:22.269
And I don't know even where,
I kept on stabbing her,


1280
01:08:22.289 --> 01:08:24.401
and I don't know what
places I got her.


1281
01:08:24.421 --> 01:08:29.250
I see her on the floor,
shaking and nervous,


1282
01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.719
so I run out the door.

1283
01:08:37.757 --> 01:08:44.461
Dwyer: Matias Reyes was a young
man living essentially by himself


1284
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:47.531
in his late teenage years.

1285
01:08:47.551 --> 01:08:50.151
He would steal Walkmans,
he would steal watches,


1286
01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:51.751
he would steal jewelry.

1287
01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:56.179
Then he started sexually
assaulting women,


1288
01:08:56.199 --> 01:09:00.264
attacking women all
around that neighborhood.


1289
01:09:00.284 --> 01:09:05.977
On April 17, 1989, just two days
before the jogger was attacked,


1290
01:09:05.997 --> 01:09:09.724
he attacked a woman in the
northern part of Central Park.


1291
01:09:09.744 --> 01:09:14.251
But the woman noticed that he
had fresh stitches on his chin,


1292
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:16.589
and she told the
police about this.


1293
01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:22.899
And a young detective went
to the hospitals in the area


1294
01:09:22.919 --> 01:09:26.279
and found out that there had
been a guy named Matias Reyes


1295
01:09:26.299 --> 01:09:29.828
who had these
stitches on his chin.


1296
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:32.138
That was ignored.

1297
01:09:32.589 --> 01:09:35.040
He was the "East Side Rapist"
that we'd been covering


1298
01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.871
in the "Daily News."

1299
01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:39.402
And one of the police officers

1300
01:09:39.422 --> 01:09:41.313
who was working on
the jogger case


1301
01:09:41.333 --> 01:09:45.462
and also working on one of
the rapes that Reyes has


1302
01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:50.290
been accused of, has the
DNA markers in both files.


1303
01:09:50.637 --> 01:09:54.684
Detective Mike Sheehan...
he knew because he was working


1304
01:09:54.704 --> 01:09:56.769
with Linda Fairstein
and Elizabeth Lederer


1305
01:09:56.789 --> 01:09:59.022
and all the other detectives...
he knew that there


1306
01:09:59.042 --> 01:10:03.481
was no DNA match to these
young Central Park Five.


1307
01:10:05.055 --> 01:10:07.355
TV reporter: The only real
evidence the prosecutors have


1308
01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:10.776
is the evidence the defendants
gave them: Hours of graphic


1309
01:10:10.796 --> 01:10:12.488
videotaped confessions.

1310
01:10:12.798 --> 01:10:15.986
Kassin: What is particularly
disturbing about this case


1311
01:10:16.006 --> 01:10:19.894
and about so many other cases
like it is that once that


1312
01:10:19.914 --> 01:10:23.722
confession is taken and once
that confession is in the air,


1313
01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:25.981
it corrupts everything else.

1314
01:10:26.434 --> 01:10:31.280
And confessions will trump
DNA, confessions will change


1315
01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:35.377
witnesses' testimony,
confessions are irresistibly


1316
01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:38.792
persuasive, and almost the
effects can't be reversed.


1317
01:10:51.996 --> 01:10:53.796
Rather: Screening for
jurors began today


1318
01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:56.625
in a case that shocked New
York and jolted the nation.


1319
01:10:56.645 --> 01:11:00.250
Prosecutors are expected
to call 50 witnesses, possibly


1320
01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:01.678
including the victim herself.

1321
01:11:01.698 --> 01:11:06.251
Woman: Though she has no memory of the
attack, prosecutors expect her to testify.


1322
01:11:06.271 --> 01:11:08.524
Her mere appearance will
pack an emotional punch


1323
01:11:08.544 --> 01:11:10.382
for the prosecution's case.

1324
01:11:15.058 --> 01:11:18.598
Santana Jr.: In the back of my mind, I
knew we wasn't gonna beat this case.


1325
01:11:19.434 --> 01:11:21.462
It was in the paper too much.

1326
01:11:21.566 --> 01:11:23.434
Too many people
were against us.


1327
01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.730
Everybody washed
their hands from us,


1328
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:33.834
and I felt like people accepted
whatever happened to us.


1329
01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:38.069
It was like, "Whatever happens
to those kids, forget 'em."


1330
01:11:43.962 --> 01:11:47.822
McCray: My father, as the trial
came, he left me and my mother.


1331
01:11:48.131 --> 01:11:49.128
Disappeared.

1332
01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:51.965
I couldn't understand.

1333
01:11:51.985 --> 01:11:54.545
And I just, I hated
him after that.


1334
01:11:57.946 --> 01:12:00.802
Me and my mother started
going to court by ourself.


1335
01:12:03.318 --> 01:12:05.411
Demonstrators, you know
people just shouting,


1336
01:12:05.431 --> 01:12:07.581
you know, "Rapist",
"You animal."


1337
01:12:07.601 --> 01:12:09.506
"You don't deserve
to be alive."


1338
01:12:10.933 --> 01:12:14.086
It just felt like the
whole world hated us.


1339
01:12:17.601 --> 01:12:21.816
Joseph: The amazing thing to me
in meeting Antron was that he was


1340
01:12:21.836 --> 01:12:26.655
the exact opposite of the way
he was portrayed in the news.


1341
01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:31.284
He is a timid, calm,
non-aggressive individual,


1342
01:12:31.304 --> 01:12:34.092
not anything as
he was portrayed.


1343
01:12:39.094 --> 01:12:42.080
Woman: In her opening argument,
the prosecutor made it clear


1344
01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:44.706
their own words would be
the main evidence against


1345
01:12:44.726 --> 01:12:46.489
the first three defendants.

1346
01:12:46.509 --> 01:12:47.653
Lederer: Where
were you standing?


1347
01:12:47.673 --> 01:12:49.478
Santana Jr.: I was on
the side of Kevin.


1348
01:12:50.239 --> 01:12:51.788
Lederer: Were you watching?

1349
01:12:51.892 --> 01:12:53.647
Santana Jr.: No, I was
grabbing the lady's tits.


1350
01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:56.274
It was very hard not to
believe those confessions.


1351
01:12:56.294 --> 01:12:57.879
Lederer: What was Anton
doing to her clothes?


1352
01:12:57.899 --> 01:12:59.644
Santana Jr.: Trying
to pull them off.


1353
01:12:59.664 --> 01:13:00.815
It seemed genuine.

1354
01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:02.289
These confessions
seemed genuine.


1355
01:13:02.309 --> 01:13:05.810
They didn't seem like they were
rehearsed or made up or anything.


1356
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.701
I think that Raymond lied.

1357
01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:09.589
It'll come out
that Raymond lied.


1358
01:13:09.701 --> 01:13:13.384
He was lying when he was
being asked questions by


1359
01:13:13.404 --> 01:13:14.576
the district attorney,

1360
01:13:14.596 --> 01:13:18.584
and I think that will come
out very... graphically


1361
01:13:18.697 --> 01:13:20.622
in my cross
examination tomorrow.


1362
01:13:20.642 --> 01:13:23.973
Woman: Yusef Salaam didn't make
taped statements, but police say he


1363
01:13:23.993 --> 01:13:27.708
verbally admitted beating the
female jogger with a lead pipe


1364
01:13:27.728 --> 01:13:29.698
while others climbed
on top of her.


1365
01:13:32.358 --> 01:13:34.941
Salaam: Bobby burns... He
was a friend of my mom's.


1366
01:13:35.382 --> 01:13:37.814
He was originally
a divorce lawyer.


1367
01:13:40.435 --> 01:13:41.881
I thought he was a nice guy.

1368
01:13:42.078 --> 01:13:46.595
But at one point in time I
remember looking over at him


1369
01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.590
and I thought he was sleeping.

1370
01:13:55.551 --> 01:13:58.518
Santana Jr.: Mentally, you know,
physically it was draining,


1371
01:13:58.749 --> 01:14:00.806
not knowing what's going on,

1372
01:14:00.956 --> 01:14:04.374
seeing these people get on the
stand, nobody actually saying


1373
01:14:04.394 --> 01:14:05.332
you did it.

1374
01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:13.943
Woman: ...That there is
another perspective.


1375
01:14:14.066 --> 01:14:17.505
Crowd: No more
Scottsboro boys!


1376
01:14:17.525 --> 01:14:18.566
No more Scottsboro boys!

1377
01:14:18.586 --> 01:14:22.396
Woman: There has been no evidence
in any form that could show me,


1378
01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:29.626
for one moment, anything related to his
being anything other than innocent.


1379
01:14:29.646 --> 01:14:31.343
Yusef is innocent.

1380
01:14:31.363 --> 01:14:32.665
Crowd shouting: No justice.
No peace!


1381
01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:34.270
No justice. No peace!

1382
01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:35.701
No justice. No peace!

1383
01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:36.551
No justice. No peace!

1384
01:14:36.571 --> 01:14:39.190
There have been charges
of racism, that authorities


1385
01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:42.162
aggressively pursued the case
because the victim is white


1386
01:14:42.182 --> 01:14:44.427
and the suspects
Black and Hispanic.


1387
01:14:44.447 --> 01:14:46.869
Woman: Meantime, a group of
people came to demonstrate


1388
01:14:46.889 --> 01:14:49.702
for the female jogger and
against a regular cadre


1389
01:14:49.722 --> 01:14:52.097
of protestors who have
suggested that the jogger's


1390
01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:53.186
boyfriend raped her.

1391
01:14:53.206 --> 01:14:55.242
Where the jogger's boyfriend?

1392
01:14:55.262 --> 01:14:57.280
Where's the
jogger's boyfriend?


1393
01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.301
Woman: All people should
be outraged about this,


1394
01:14:59.414 --> 01:15:01.517
not any particular race.

1395
01:15:01.537 --> 01:15:04.854
We need to remember that this
was a human being and people


1396
01:15:04.874 --> 01:15:06.017
need to support that.

1397
01:15:06.253 --> 01:15:08.716
Yesterday, Mayor David
Dinkins also condemed


1398
01:15:08.736 --> 01:15:09.938
the regular protestors

1399
01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:13.375
who even jeered at the injured
jogger the day she testified.


1400
01:15:17.796 --> 01:15:21.280
Woman: She walked with an unsteady
gait, clutched the railing


1401
01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.818
as she stepped into
the witness stand.


1402
01:15:23.495 --> 01:15:25.260
Her scars were evident,

1403
01:15:25.833 --> 01:15:28.725
but she spoke clearly in
a strong, sweet voice.


1404
01:15:29.903 --> 01:15:32.098
Hancock: She was a miracle
now at this point.


1405
01:15:32.692 --> 01:15:35.679
She couldn't contribute
anything to the actual case


1406
01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.703
because thankfully she
couldn't remember.


1407
01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:42.201
But the fact of her being
on the stand galvanized


1408
01:15:42.221 --> 01:15:46.959
the public around her and
against these young boys.


1409
01:15:49.242 --> 01:15:51.611
McCray: I was like just sitting
there, like looking, like, "Man",


1410
01:15:51.632 --> 01:15:53.692
I really hope this
lady can remember."


1411
01:15:53.713 --> 01:15:56.095
You know, I'm, like, "Why
she can't remember?"


1412
01:15:56.329 --> 01:15:58.897
It's messed up what happened
to her, but I didn't do it.


1413
01:16:02.971 --> 01:16:05.902
Woman: With the prosecution resting
its case in the final hour today,


1414
01:16:05.922 --> 01:16:08.020
the defense begins its
case tomorrow, starting


1415
01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.621
with the parents
of Antron McCray.


1416
01:16:11.553 --> 01:16:17.564
Joseph: My strategy was obviously
to try to convince the jury that


1417
01:16:17.584 --> 01:16:21.403
the statements were not
accurate, were the product


1418
01:16:21.423 --> 01:16:24.442
of coercion, should
be inadmissible,


1419
01:16:24.462 --> 01:16:26.352
and were not credible.

1420
01:16:26.372 --> 01:16:30.212
But when they testified in
court, the police officers


1421
01:16:30.232 --> 01:16:34.071
said, "All we did is ask
him what happened."


1422
01:16:34.446 --> 01:16:37.016
That seemed to me
to be incredible.


1423
01:16:37.036 --> 01:16:40.829
They also denied that
they ever made any


1424
01:16:40.849 --> 01:16:43.066
promises whatsoever.

1425
01:16:43.086 --> 01:16:47.319
They denied even knowing
Antron was a suspect.


1426
01:16:47.995 --> 01:16:51.047
Gold: Even though he had asked him
to tell the truth no matter what


1427
01:16:51.067 --> 01:16:53.507
and to bring the clothes he
was wearing, and all kinds


1428
01:16:53.527 --> 01:16:57.364
of stuff, that made it perfectly
obvious that he was a suspect,


1429
01:16:57.384 --> 01:16:59.147
he said he didn't think
of him as a suspect.


1430
01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:00.706
That was just nonsense.

1431
01:17:00.998 --> 01:17:04.377
Some of the detectives were obviously
lying through their teeth.


1432
01:17:05.799 --> 01:17:09.457
Dwyer: The lawyers in the
case had another defense,


1433
01:17:09.477 --> 01:17:11.784
which is they had alibis.

1434
01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.955
They were not where the jogger
was when she was attacked.


1435
01:17:18.975 --> 01:17:20.399
Why?

1436
01:17:20.419 --> 01:17:22.737
They were beating
up other people.


1437
01:17:23.869 --> 01:17:27.856
That alibi defense
was not offered.


1438
01:17:29.769 --> 01:17:31.850
Gold: The only evidence
against Yusef was


1439
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:34.886
the testimony of
McKenna, the detective.


1440
01:17:35.033 --> 01:17:39.472
And Burns absolutely
undercut Yusef in the most


1441
01:17:39.492 --> 01:17:41.524
terrifying way.

1442
01:17:41.901 --> 01:17:46.367
He put into evidence the notes
of McKenna which hadn't been


1443
01:17:46.387 --> 01:17:48.260
put into evidence before.

1444
01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.284
And that was the only
evidence against Yusef.


1445
01:17:53.718 --> 01:17:55.609
Santana Jr.: There was
one part during trial


1446
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:58.849
I think Peter Rivera,
my lawyer, he woke up.


1447
01:17:58.869 --> 01:18:01.212
And they was talking about
the statements, of how


1448
01:18:01.232 --> 01:18:03.726
the statements were
coerced by the police.


1449
01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:08.301
I remember him reading
something, and I heard him...


1450
01:18:08.321 --> 01:18:10.205
I heard him whisper it.

1451
01:18:10.225 --> 01:18:11.909
He didn't say it loud
but he sat next to me.


1452
01:18:11.929 --> 01:18:15.181
He said, "They didn't do it."

1453
01:18:15.201 --> 01:18:18.021
And I heard him say that.

1454
01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:20.826
And I said, "All right, well,
maybe now he gonna fight."


1455
01:18:20.846 --> 01:18:22.782
But it was too late.

1456
01:18:24.853 --> 01:18:26.639
Gold: No blood on the kids.

1457
01:18:26.659 --> 01:18:28.894
Nobody could identify them.

1458
01:18:29.791 --> 01:18:32.073
It was just a
question of believing


1459
01:18:32.093 --> 01:18:33.510
the confessions or not.

1460
01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:38.340
And it was very hard to imagine
why anybody would make up


1461
01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.622
something that not only
incriminates them but is full


1462
01:18:42.642 --> 01:18:46.672
of details that sound like
they actually happened.


1463
01:18:47.869 --> 01:18:51.456
Santana Jr.: It got to one point where
they pulled me, Yusef, and Antron


1464
01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:53.093
in the conference room.

1465
01:18:53.113 --> 01:18:56.422
And the lawyer says, "You know,
we're gonna lose this case."


1466
01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.834
What we're planning to do is see
if we can get you a plea deal."


1467
01:19:01.782 --> 01:19:05.351
Salaam: And I remember telling them,
you know, "You guys can cop out."


1468
01:19:05.371 --> 01:19:09.874
"But if I did something,
I would cop out.


1469
01:19:10.221 --> 01:19:13.099
"I would want the least amount
of time for what I did.


1470
01:19:13.329 --> 01:19:17.007
But if I didn't do anything, you can
give me the rest of my life in prison."


1471
01:19:17.251 --> 01:19:20.348
You know, I didn't know what
that meant back then, but I


1472
01:19:20.368 --> 01:19:23.738
just knew that there would be
no way that I would cop out


1473
01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:25.213
for something
that I didn't do.


1474
01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:29.232
They said, "Well, it has to be all
three of you guys or it's nobody."


1475
01:19:29.252 --> 01:19:32.406
And so we, you know, we
looked at each other.


1476
01:19:32.426 --> 01:19:34.510
We was like, "Well,
guess it's nobody."


1477
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.948
Coming out. Let's roll.

1478
01:19:36.968 --> 01:19:39.641
The crimes and the colors in
this case have been a focus


1479
01:19:39.661 --> 01:19:41.691
of attention here for
more than a year.


1480
01:19:42.018 --> 01:19:45.181
It will now be up to a jury to
decide the guilt or innocence


1481
01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:46.335
of the defendants.

1482
01:19:46.355 --> 01:19:49.442
John McKenzie, ABC
News, New York.


1483
01:19:55.588 --> 01:19:59.389
It is day 10 of deliberations
and the jogger jury appears to


1484
01:19:59.409 --> 01:20:01.089
be going back to what
they were thinking


1485
01:20:01.109 --> 01:20:03.102
about on day one.

1486
01:20:03.122 --> 01:20:06.603
Were those damaging videotaped
confessions coerced by cops,


1487
01:20:06.772 --> 01:20:08.228
overeager to solve the case?

1488
01:20:08.248 --> 01:20:09.282
Joseph: Each day that

1489
01:20:09.302 --> 01:20:11.666
the jury remained out,

1490
01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:15.601
I started to get a
little more optimistic.


1491
01:20:15.861 --> 01:20:16.752
People were shocked.

1492
01:20:16.772 --> 01:20:20.215
What's taking them so long?
They confessed to it!


1493
01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:25.000
I was going nuts,
quite frankly.


1494
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.864
I mean, everyone was blaming
the fact that we were there


1495
01:20:27.884 --> 01:20:29.365
so long on me.

1496
01:20:29.612 --> 01:20:33.270
And I had to fight with my
fellow jurors to consider


1497
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:36.597
the discrepancies between
the 3 statements,


1498
01:20:36.728 --> 01:20:39.312
but it didn't matter to them.

1499
01:20:39.517 --> 01:20:42.155
If they confessed, they
confessed, and that was that.


1500
01:20:42.947 --> 01:20:45.781
Everyone's hurling
imprecations at me and


1501
01:20:45.801 --> 01:20:47.379
telling me what a rat I am.

1502
01:20:47.736 --> 01:20:51.294
And I just went along with it
at the end because,


1503
01:20:51.679 --> 01:20:53.651
frankly, I was wiped out.

1504
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:59.256
I found some cockamamie
excuse to vote guilty,


1505
01:20:59.276 --> 01:21:00.591
just to get outta there.

1506
01:21:15.007 --> 01:21:18.864
Santana Jr.: When the verdict
came out, they brung us out.


1507
01:21:19.079 --> 01:21:20.566
The courtroom was packed.

1508
01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.909
As they started to read,
everything kinda got numb.


1509
01:21:25.253 --> 01:21:27.669
McCray: I remember
standing there and just,


1510
01:21:27.689 --> 01:21:29.078
they found me guilty.

1511
01:21:29.098 --> 01:21:32.275
That's when I was just...
the world just collapsed.


1512
01:21:32.795 --> 01:21:34.711
Salaam: My whole
insides dropped.


1513
01:21:34.731 --> 01:21:38.456
Just... like this is crazy.

1514
01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:39.424
Are you... are you kidding me?

1515
01:21:39.444 --> 01:21:41.621
Like, I couldn't
believe it at all.


1516
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.358
McCray: I couldn't hear nothing after that.
I just sat down.


1517
01:21:45.518 --> 01:21:47.827
I looked back at my mother.
She was crying.


1518
01:21:51.377 --> 01:21:52.633
You know, that was it.

1519
01:21:52.653 --> 01:21:55.069
Woman: After the jury foreman,
a law school graduate...


1520
01:21:55.089 --> 01:21:57.973
One of my friends had a
radio, and then I heard it.


1521
01:21:57.993 --> 01:22:01.926
Woman, continuing: Guilty, guilty, guilty
on rape, robbery, riot, and assault...


1522
01:22:02.095 --> 01:22:03.682
Tears came out of my eye.

1523
01:22:04.038 --> 01:22:05.082
And I was mad.

1524
01:22:05.102 --> 01:22:09.019
Woman, continuing: 16-year-old McCray
clenched his jaw and brushed away tears.


1525
01:22:09.374 --> 01:22:11.957
15-year-old Santana
looked wide-eyed ahead,


1526
01:22:12.142 --> 01:22:15.288
while Salaam stared at the jurors,
then back at the courtroom.


1527
01:22:15.419 --> 01:22:17.763
Pure anguish.

1528
01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:22.880
Joseph: Antron leaned over to me
and said, "Thank you very much"


1529
01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.891
for all of your efforts."

1530
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:30.713
That's not something that you
see from clients in general


1531
01:22:30.733 --> 01:22:34.837
and certainly not something
you would expect to see


1532
01:22:34.857 --> 01:22:36.133
from a young man,

1533
01:22:36.153 --> 01:22:37.976
and I truly appreciated it.

1534
01:22:39.175 --> 01:22:41.693
McCray: I just looked at him, and I
was like, "Thank you for helping me."


1535
01:22:41.713 --> 01:22:43.493
He did his best.

1536
01:22:43.981 --> 01:22:46.383
He did his best, you
know, in my eyes.


1537
01:22:49.087 --> 01:22:50.892
Santana Jr.: They
took me out first.


1538
01:22:51.759 --> 01:22:54.958
They asked for my belt,
they asked for my laces.


1539
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:59.897
And then Yusef and Antron came
out like a little bit after me.


1540
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:01.878
And then we cried.

1541
01:23:01.898 --> 01:23:03.756
We cried inside the bull pen.

1542
01:23:03.962 --> 01:23:07.557
We didn't... it was like you
didn't wanna show them that,


1543
01:23:07.577 --> 01:23:12.230
you know, because you didn't
want them to see defeat.


1544
01:23:12.475 --> 01:23:14.802
So you know we did it
when we went in the back.


1545
01:23:16.348 --> 01:23:18.432
Woman: The defendants'
families left the courtroom


1546
01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:20.084
quickly, in tears.

1547
01:23:20.104 --> 01:23:22.555
They left without
their teenage sons.


1548
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.639
All right!

1549
01:23:28.659 --> 01:23:30.197
Thank you!

1550
01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:35.097
Law and order in the nation's
largest city seemed to get


1551
01:23:35.117 --> 01:23:38.028
a boost tonight as the first
three youths to be tried


1552
01:23:38.048 --> 01:23:40.597
in the Central Park jogger
case were found guilty


1553
01:23:40.617 --> 01:23:43.445
of gang rape and brutal
assault and robbery.


1554
01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:45.637
Woman: You're pleased
with the verdicts?


1555
01:23:45.657 --> 01:23:46.459
I am.

1556
01:23:46.479 --> 01:23:50.120
How much of a help has your
detectives... have your detectives


1557
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:51.579
been to you during this case?

1558
01:23:51.599 --> 01:23:53.838
Lederer: They've been the best.
They're terrific.


1559
01:23:53.974 --> 01:23:56.856
Woman: Were you concerned about
the lack of genetic evidence?


1560
01:23:56.876 --> 01:23:59.982
A lot of people made a big
deal about that, that none


1561
01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:02.149
of the semen from the
defendants matched that


1562
01:24:02.169 --> 01:24:03.623
that was found in the jogger.

1563
01:24:03.643 --> 01:24:05.476
I think, because
there's another trial,


1564
01:24:05.496 --> 01:24:07.101
it's better not to
discuss the evidence.


1565
01:24:07.121 --> 01:24:09.590
Woman: How do you feel about
the prospect of another trial?


1566
01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:11.826
I think I could use a
vacation before we start.


1567
01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:14.607
- Are you going to give it to her?
- I'm going to give it to her.


1568
01:24:44.745 --> 01:24:46.162
Richardson: They
offered me a plea.


1569
01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:49.580
And I said, "I will never plead to
anything 'cause I was innocent."


1570
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.646
And that we gonna fight this
the whole way through."


1571
01:24:58.967 --> 01:25:01.162
It was just really a circus.

1572
01:25:01.584 --> 01:25:03.622
At this time, I was 16 now.

1573
01:25:04.185 --> 01:25:07.218
So it was already two years
of going through that.


1574
01:25:09.467 --> 01:25:12.640
Wise: I'm just goin' from
Rikers Island, back and forth,


1575
01:25:12.762 --> 01:25:15.345
goin' to this court
thing like it's a job.


1576
01:25:16.668 --> 01:25:20.618
Her only argument on me
is my confession tapes.


1577
01:25:20.638 --> 01:25:22.020
Lederer: Did you
hold her legs down?


1578
01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.191
Wise, on tape: I hold her legs
down for what? 5 seconds.


1579
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:31.296
Wise: So I'm lookin' at
this like..."That's me?


1580
01:25:32.954 --> 01:25:37.322
"Is that me? She usin'
me against me."


1581
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:41.630
16-year-old Kevin Richardson
has been quiet through most


1582
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:43.880
of the trial, but
his mother has not.


1583
01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.508
Cuffie: He was set
up, he was set up.


1584
01:25:46.528 --> 01:25:47.550
Richardson's attorney

1585
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:50.721
says he won't claim his client's
taped confession was coerced.


1586
01:25:51.002 --> 01:25:53.789
Instead, he'll argue
Richardson was with the gang


1587
01:25:53.809 --> 01:25:56.005
but never took part
in any of the crimes.


1588
01:25:56.025 --> 01:25:58.343
Wise's attorney said he'll
try to show the confessions


1589
01:25:58.363 --> 01:25:59.639
were coerced.

1590
01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.977
By putting him under
continuous pressure


1591
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.639
for 1 hour and 24 minutes,

1592
01:26:03.751 --> 01:26:06.512
after he had been interrogated
for over 24 hours,


1593
01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:08.877
that amounts to pressure.

1594
01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:13.149
I was asked from my
lawyer, Colin Moore,


1595
01:26:13.421 --> 01:26:15.260
do I wanna testify?

1596
01:26:16.369 --> 01:26:20.467
And the D.A., she came up
there tearin' me apart.


1597
01:26:21.327 --> 01:26:24.696
I had wanted to get up and
say, "Woman you don't know me!"


1598
01:26:24.716 --> 01:26:27.083
You talkin' like you know me.
You don't know me."


1599
01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.082
Black: The reporters
were runnin',


1600
01:26:33.102 --> 01:26:36.675
and people were runnin', and we
were like, "What's goin' on?"


1601
01:26:36.695 --> 01:26:38.280
And somebody said,
"The verdict is in."


1602
01:26:42.085 --> 01:26:43.869
Richardson: The first thing
I heard was "Guilty,"


1603
01:26:44.382 --> 01:26:47.592
and everything else was
just like fading out.


1604
01:26:48.817 --> 01:26:51.395
Wise: The judge said,
"How do you find?"


1605
01:26:51.578 --> 01:26:55.934
"Guilty: Assault, riot,
and sexual abuse."


1606
01:26:57.690 --> 01:26:59.004
So that was that.

1607
01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:03.009
I remember being handcuffed
right on the spot,


1608
01:27:04.539 --> 01:27:07.713
and that's when I felt
completely alone,


1609
01:27:08.341 --> 01:27:11.364
'cause, you know, before I had my family
at least supportin' me, you know.


1610
01:27:13.486 --> 01:27:18.995
But at that point once the gates
closed and I was in the cell,


1611
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:24.089
and I just thought my life
was pretty much over.


1612
01:27:33.347 --> 01:27:36.538
Get the... out of my face!

1613
01:27:36.558 --> 01:27:37.690
Outside the courthouse,

1614
01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:39.625
supporters of the two
teenagers erupted


1615
01:27:39.645 --> 01:27:40.883
with violent emotion.

1616
01:27:42.677 --> 01:27:45.861
Get the... out!

1617
01:27:45.881 --> 01:27:49.330
Inside, 16-year-old Kevin
Richardson cried loudly.


1618
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.240
His mother screamed, "We
love you", and collapsed,


1619
01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:54.304
later to be taken
to a hospital.


1620
01:27:54.324 --> 01:27:57.342
18-year-old Korey Wise
shouted, "Racism,"


1621
01:27:57.362 --> 01:27:58.676
as he was led from court.

1622
01:27:58.696 --> 01:28:01.339
The prosecutor was taken
from court under heavy guard


1623
01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.555
as an angry crowd
swirled around her.


1624
01:28:03.575 --> 01:28:05.451
You lying ...! You lied!

1625
01:28:05.771 --> 01:28:08.354
This was the second
trial in the jogger case.


1626
01:28:08.374 --> 01:28:10.836
Last summer, three teenagers
were convicted of rape


1627
01:28:10.856 --> 01:28:13.767
and assault and are now
serving their juvenile terms.


1628
01:28:37.609 --> 01:28:39.826
This is the test Mayor
Koch had laid out.


1629
01:28:39.846 --> 01:28:45.718
He was out of office now but
people felt the system had passed.


1630
01:28:56.299 --> 01:29:00.285
Richardson: I went to a maximum
security for juveniles.


1631
01:29:00.305 --> 01:29:05.197
Me and Yusef Salaam, we wound
up being in the same place.


1632
01:29:07.465 --> 01:29:14.335
I remember sayin' that we just
have to stay strong together


1633
01:29:14.355 --> 01:29:15.791
and try to get through
this together 'cause


1634
01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:18.109
all we have is each other
right at this point.


1635
01:29:19.695 --> 01:29:22.478
Santana Jr.: In the beginning, it was
very hard because they perceived me


1636
01:29:22.498 --> 01:29:26.349
as this was a rapist
and, uh... he committed


1637
01:29:26.369 --> 01:29:29.744
one of the most heinous crimes
in New York State history.


1638
01:29:30.533 --> 01:29:33.558
You could be the most peaceful
person, but then you come to


1639
01:29:33.578 --> 01:29:36.895
the point where you have to
defend yourself to avoid


1640
01:29:36.915 --> 01:29:41.761
possibly being beaten, or
worse, even, you know, killed.


1641
01:29:41.781 --> 01:29:45.655
So I had to adjust to that
environment and basically


1642
01:29:45.675 --> 01:29:47.825
I had to grow up really fast.

1643
01:29:49.262 --> 01:29:52.942
McCray: And it's real hectic in
there, you know, people dying


1644
01:29:52.962 --> 01:29:54.408
over cigarettes.

1645
01:29:55.304 --> 01:29:56.737
It's real crazy.

1646
01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:12.607
Santana Jr.: Why me?

1647
01:30:13.126 --> 01:30:15.700
Cursed God out a
coup of times.


1648
01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:18.312
You know, my faith was gone.

1649
01:30:18.332 --> 01:30:22.818
I lost that, um, ah...

1650
01:30:22.838 --> 01:30:25.436
Just my faith was
gone and, um...


1651
01:30:26.216 --> 01:30:29.276
I didn't, um...
Know what to do.


1652
01:30:33.802 --> 01:30:35.834
My father came
once in a while.


1653
01:30:35.854 --> 01:30:38.506
He apologized to me, but
I didn't accept it.


1654
01:30:40.024 --> 01:30:41.829
My mother came a lot.

1655
01:30:42.402 --> 01:30:44.675
I mean, there was sometimes I
had to tell her to stay home


1656
01:30:44.695 --> 01:30:47.212
because the weather
would be so messed up.


1657
01:30:47.813 --> 01:30:49.802
She'd still come.

1658
01:30:54.308 --> 01:30:56.636
Wise: When I heard that
my dad had passed,


1659
01:30:57.402 --> 01:30:58.946
it was hurtin', uh...

1660
01:30:59.951 --> 01:31:04.234
It was hurting and I would
think, surely think, he just...


1661
01:31:04.254 --> 01:31:06.320
he drunk hisself to death.

1662
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.841
You know, through... what do they call that?
Cirrhosis of the liver?


1663
01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:16.955
But no one shared it with
me or gave me the chance


1664
01:31:16.975 --> 01:31:18.719
to come down.

1665
01:31:18.739 --> 01:31:21.703
So I just learned it
and that was that.


1666
01:31:23.331 --> 01:31:24.777
That was that.

1667
01:31:33.322 --> 01:31:37.615
But as time passed, I
started to make changes.


1668
01:31:38.529 --> 01:31:40.978
I was able to get my G.E.D.

1669
01:31:40.998 --> 01:31:42.881
I was able to get a
degree, you know.


1670
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:44.283
I got an associate's.

1671
01:31:44.303 --> 01:31:47.687
I jumped on the opportunity
to go to college.


1672
01:31:47.707 --> 01:31:51.126
It was a real graduation,
the Dean and everybody.


1673
01:31:51.779 --> 01:31:55.287
Salaam: I was able to get a
college degree before they took


1674
01:31:55.307 --> 01:31:57.166
education out of prison.

1675
01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.128
McCray: They stopped the program,
so I didn't get a degree.


1676
01:32:01.894 --> 01:32:04.273
After that, I just started doing
trades and stuff like that.


1677
01:32:04.293 --> 01:32:05.855
Like I worked in the tailor
shop, and that was like


1678
01:32:05.875 --> 01:32:07.951
the highest-paying
job in prison.


1679
01:32:08.749 --> 01:32:11.182
I think it was, like,

1680
01:32:13.339 --> 01:32:15.187
woman on radio: Good
afternoon, 47 degrees...


1681
01:32:15.207 --> 01:32:17.292
In New York,
republican Rudolph Giuliani


1682
01:32:17.312 --> 01:32:18.924
defeated incumbent
David Dinkins...


1683
01:32:18.944 --> 01:32:20.160
Mayor Dinkins' handling

1684
01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:23.029
of the Black on Jewish Crown
Heights rioting hurt him.


1685
01:32:23.049 --> 01:32:26.015
Giuliani promises tougher
approaches to homelessness


1686
01:32:26.035 --> 01:32:26.801
and crime...

1687
01:32:26.821 --> 01:32:28.737
Giuliani: Squeegee operators
and excessive noise


1688
01:32:28.757 --> 01:32:30.138
and aggressive panhandling...

1689
01:32:30.158 --> 01:32:32.442
Woman: Crime has plunged 33%

1690
01:32:32.462 --> 01:32:33.775
from the same month
a year ago...


1691
01:32:33.795 --> 01:32:34.978
Since 1990,

1692
01:32:34.998 --> 01:32:37.246
homicides have fallen
dramatically in New York...


1693
01:32:37.266 --> 01:32:39.850
Brokaw: New York City is
no longer a crime capital.


1694
01:32:47.378 --> 01:32:49.228
Richardson: I came
up to parole.


1695
01:32:49.248 --> 01:32:53.367
And my hearing lasted
a couple of minutes.


1696
01:32:53.387 --> 01:32:54.787
I walked in.

1697
01:32:55.889 --> 01:32:58.158
You know, said who I was.

1698
01:32:58.993 --> 01:33:01.908
They looked at the time
that I'd been there


1699
01:33:01.928 --> 01:33:03.758
and realized that I haven't
gotten into no trouble


1700
01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:05.083
the whole time.

1701
01:33:06.529 --> 01:33:08.323
They just wanted
to know one thing.


1702
01:33:08.671 --> 01:33:11.322
They said, "Did you
do the crime?"


1703
01:33:11.615 --> 01:33:12.835
I said, "No."

1704
01:33:13.344 --> 01:33:15.633
They told me, "Have
a good day."


1705
01:33:42.912 --> 01:33:45.362
McCray: Got my stuff,
my personal stuff,


1706
01:33:45.382 --> 01:33:47.765
had my money in my account,

1707
01:33:47.785 --> 01:33:49.881
and they took me
to the bus stop.


1708
01:33:51.824 --> 01:33:54.292
Called my mother
every stop we made,


1709
01:33:54.489 --> 01:33:56.653
let her know where I was at.

1710
01:33:57.705 --> 01:34:00.456
And I'm just looking
around, like, wow, free.


1711
01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.523
Got home, forgot the
building I lived in


1712
01:34:07.543 --> 01:34:08.925
'cause all the
buildings look alike.


1713
01:34:08.945 --> 01:34:11.057
I went in the wrong building.

1714
01:34:11.982 --> 01:34:14.382
My mother and my
father ran downstairs.


1715
01:34:16.723 --> 01:34:19.270
The day he was actually
released he said, "They're


1716
01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:20.286
sending me home on a bus."

1717
01:34:20.306 --> 01:34:22.440
We're like, "Nope. We're
comin' to get you."


1718
01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.176
And of course, my family
was crying which made me


1719
01:34:24.196 --> 01:34:26.145
start to cry.

1720
01:34:26.165 --> 01:34:30.283
And everybody jumped up. You
know, we jumped for joy


1721
01:34:30.303 --> 01:34:35.041
and we got in the car,

1722
01:34:35.061 --> 01:34:37.355
and we sped off and
never looked back.


1723
01:34:37.375 --> 01:34:40.623
And we drove. It was about

1724
01:34:41.562 --> 01:34:45.254
And so we went straight,
like, not even stoppin'.


1725
01:34:47.123 --> 01:34:48.056
Beautiful.

1726
01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:52.444
Santana Jr.: When
I was released...


1727
01:34:52.464 --> 01:34:54.379
Best feeling in the
world, you know.


1728
01:34:54.399 --> 01:34:55.948
I said, "Wow."

1729
01:34:55.968 --> 01:34:58.184
You know, I got
a fresh start.


1730
01:34:58.204 --> 01:35:00.973
I can try to pick up, put
my life back together.


1731
01:35:00.993 --> 01:35:02.689
Yeah, he came home.

1732
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:06.861
And I was happy he's
home and all that.


1733
01:35:06.881 --> 01:35:10.791
But you know, I brung a lot
of stuff with me, you know,


1734
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:13.007
that I didn't
even know exists.


1735
01:35:13.389 --> 01:35:15.531
I loved to stay inside my
room, 'cause my room was like


1736
01:35:15.551 --> 01:35:17.174
the size of a cell.

1737
01:35:17.194 --> 01:35:19.710
I would go in the shower
and wash in my boxers,


1738
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:22.113
wash my boxers in the shower.

1739
01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:24.082
I had this aggression.

1740
01:35:24.102 --> 01:35:27.085
You know, if I'm in a room
with too many people,


1741
01:35:27.105 --> 01:35:30.623
I can talk to you but I won't
give you eye-to-eye contact


1742
01:35:30.643 --> 01:35:32.310
'cause I'm too busy
watching the room.


1743
01:35:34.817 --> 01:35:36.864
McCray: When I got home, my
father, he was living, you know,


1744
01:35:36.884 --> 01:35:39.192
with my mother because
they were back together.


1745
01:35:41.085 --> 01:35:44.006
But I didn't really...
I didn't talk to him.


1746
01:35:44.026 --> 01:35:46.464
We lived in the same house, but
I didn't even talk to him.


1747
01:35:47.664 --> 01:35:50.315
I noticed he was getting sick,
'cause he lost a lot of weight.


1748
01:35:50.335 --> 01:35:53.522
He was real sick.
I didn't even care.


1749
01:35:55.894 --> 01:35:57.889
My mother, she would
try to get us to talk.


1750
01:35:58.044 --> 01:36:00.081
I was just like, "You don't
remember what he did to us?"


1751
01:36:00.101 --> 01:36:01.915
"You know, he left you."

1752
01:36:03.717 --> 01:36:07.491
My mother, you know, got
that call, and she was like,


1753
01:36:07.511 --> 01:36:10.005
"Your father just
passed away."


1754
01:36:10.025 --> 01:36:12.313
I was still was
like, "All right."


1755
01:36:13.428 --> 01:36:16.651
But seeing him laying
there, it just hit me.


1756
01:36:17.767 --> 01:36:19.800
You know, he used to
be my best friend.


1757
01:36:26.658 --> 01:36:29.907
Richardson: I was a sex
offender, labeled as that.


1758
01:36:30.677 --> 01:36:35.158
And I had to register,
um, every month.


1759
01:36:36.388 --> 01:36:39.204
I applied for the post
office at one point.


1760
01:36:39.224 --> 01:36:41.376
And I was about
to get the job.


1761
01:36:41.679 --> 01:36:44.520
But I'm an honest person and
so they asked me have I ever


1762
01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:46.348
been incarcerated?

1763
01:36:46.368 --> 01:36:47.657
I put yes.

1764
01:36:48.324 --> 01:36:49.873
And they didn't hire me.

1765
01:36:51.175 --> 01:36:53.535
McCray: I just wanted
to get out of New York.


1766
01:36:53.667 --> 01:36:55.459
I had a cousin that
lived in Maryland.


1767
01:36:55.479 --> 01:36:57.374
I kind of liked Maryland.

1768
01:36:57.749 --> 01:37:01.562
So I went out there job
hunting for the whole day,


1769
01:37:02.054 --> 01:37:04.458
and on the spot I got
a sanitation job.


1770
01:37:06.759 --> 01:37:09.843
Santana Jr.: Months went by
where I didn't have no money,


1771
01:37:09.863 --> 01:37:11.558
and there's nothin'
I could do.


1772
01:37:11.578 --> 01:37:13.715
I can't get a job.

1773
01:37:13.879 --> 01:37:15.650
I was becoming a burden.

1774
01:37:15.804 --> 01:37:17.755
You know, here I am in my
father's house, I'm eating


1775
01:37:17.775 --> 01:37:20.300
the food, you know,
'cause I'm a bigger guy


1776
01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.116
and I'm not contributin'.

1777
01:37:22.713 --> 01:37:24.796
I said, "I can't function."

1778
01:37:24.816 --> 01:37:26.867
That was my breaking point.

1779
01:37:27.451 --> 01:37:29.033
And so I said, "You know what?"

1780
01:37:29.053 --> 01:37:31.569
"I'm gonna just, I'm gonna
get in the drug game."


1781
01:37:31.589 --> 01:37:33.323
And I started to sell drugs.

1782
01:37:54.324 --> 01:37:58.013
Dwyer: All of the jogger
defendants have gone home


1783
01:37:58.033 --> 01:37:59.375
except one, Korey Wise.

1784
01:37:59.395 --> 01:38:01.598
He was the eldest of the
group convicted and he had


1785
01:38:01.618 --> 01:38:03.108
the longest sentence.

1786
01:38:03.299 --> 01:38:05.448
And he had stopped going to
the parole board... didn't even


1787
01:38:05.468 --> 01:38:07.966
bother going anymore
to deny his guilt.


1788
01:38:09.318 --> 01:38:13.860
One day in late 2001,
Matias Reyes meets him


1789
01:38:14.471 --> 01:38:16.245
at the Auburn prison.

1790
01:38:17.382 --> 01:38:19.672
Warren: This is the first
time they had seen each other


1791
01:38:19.692 --> 01:38:23.513
since 1989, when both of
them were at Rikers Island.


1792
01:38:24.115 --> 01:38:28.672
And at that time, they had a
little incident in the TV room.


1793
01:38:28.911 --> 01:38:32.423
And it almost, you know
escalated to blows.


1794
01:38:33.258 --> 01:38:35.681
Wise: He said, "I would
like to apologize to you."


1795
01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:39.719
We had a fight at Rikers Island
about a TV, and so forth.


1796
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:43.622
I said, "Matias, ain't
about nothin' man. Ha!"


1797
01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:48.613
"We here. It's not gonna
free neither one of us.


1798
01:38:48.692 --> 01:38:49.687
Don't worry about it."

1799
01:38:49.707 --> 01:38:51.700
Reyes doesn't say
anything to him,


1800
01:38:51.964 --> 01:38:55.704
but he starts talking to
people in the prison.


1801
01:38:56.032 --> 01:38:58.960
"Hey, I met somebody who's
doing time for a crime that he


1802
01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:01.130
didn't have anything to do
with that I did myself."


1803
01:39:01.356 --> 01:39:04.383
They send up an investigator,
and he takes this statement.


1804
01:39:04.658 --> 01:39:06.976
They send it down to the
Manhattan D.A.'s office which


1805
01:39:06.996 --> 01:39:10.857
has no idea that this case
from 13 years earlier,


1806
01:39:11.588 --> 01:39:14.472
which has long been stored and
forgotten by everybody except


1807
01:39:14.492 --> 01:39:17.514
the people involved,
is suddenly gonna come


1808
01:39:17.534 --> 01:39:18.818
back to life.

1809
01:39:21.497 --> 01:39:25.593
I showed them the top of the
entrance, the direction she came by.


1810
01:39:27.283 --> 01:39:31.143
I showed them where I picked
up the tree branch and down


1811
01:39:31.163 --> 01:39:34.281
the road where I
dragged her in.


1812
01:39:36.065 --> 01:39:37.841
I'm the one that did this.

1813
01:39:42.777 --> 01:39:45.735
When I saw Korey Wise in
Auburn, I saw in his eyes,


1814
01:39:45.755 --> 01:39:48.336
you know, the suffering that
he's been going through,


1815
01:39:48.862 --> 01:39:52.007
to know that a man has
suffered 13 years of his life


1816
01:39:52.027 --> 01:39:54.632
in jail for something
that he has not done,


1817
01:39:54.736 --> 01:39:58.481
to know that all these kids
got arrested for something


1818
01:39:58.501 --> 01:40:00.219
that they didn't do.

1819
01:40:01.001 --> 01:40:02.823
You want to know something?

1820
01:40:02.843 --> 01:40:05.009
I have done everything
possible that I can come


1821
01:40:05.029 --> 01:40:06.794
forward and admit the truth.

1822
01:40:07.104 --> 01:40:10.265
I'm to the point where if
people don't do something,


1823
01:40:10.285 --> 01:40:13.514
or if they don't do
what's right, then, hey,


1824
01:40:13.767 --> 01:40:15.452
there's nothing else I can do.

1825
01:40:20.689 --> 01:40:26.514
To hear this after all the
trials and tribulations


1826
01:40:26.534 --> 01:40:28.276
that I done been through...

1827
01:40:31.111 --> 01:40:39.033
the scuffle, the jumping
on, the stabbin',


1828
01:40:41.987 --> 01:40:44.588
the whole unneeded package...

1829
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.602
It felt so good!

1830
01:40:51.187 --> 01:40:54.716
Dwyer: Morgenthau's office begins
an exhaustive re-examination


1831
01:40:54.736 --> 01:40:55.337
of the case.

1832
01:40:55.357 --> 01:40:58.295
And they pulled out the old
files and they found the


1833
01:40:58.315 --> 01:41:02.933
unknown semen from the rape
kit, and they matched Reyes.


1834
01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.041
Then they began to
interview Reyes.


1835
01:41:06.153 --> 01:41:10.120
Reyes steps in 13 years later
and immediately gives off


1836
01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:12.506
details that turn out to be
verified and accurate that


1837
01:41:12.526 --> 01:41:13.774
the police didn't know.

1838
01:41:13.794 --> 01:41:17.539
He described her as having
black running tights on


1839
01:41:17.559 --> 01:41:18.912
and a white T-shirt.

1840
01:41:18.932 --> 01:41:21.296
That's what Ms. Meili
was wearing.


1841
01:41:21.316 --> 01:41:23.061
He tells them about
the Walkman.


1842
01:41:23.192 --> 01:41:25.681
Turns out she did
run with a Walkman.


1843
01:41:25.701 --> 01:41:28.239
Nobody knew it 'cause it
wasn't found at the scene.


1844
01:41:28.366 --> 01:41:31.059
He describes how he
took off her sneakers.


1845
01:41:31.079 --> 01:41:35.064
When the police came on the
scene and they found her,


1846
01:41:35.084 --> 01:41:39.069
her sneakers were... one
sneaker was in one location,


1847
01:41:39.089 --> 01:41:41.071
another sneaker was
in another location.


1848
01:41:41.091 --> 01:41:44.217
He talked about taking her keys
and trying to get her address


1849
01:41:44.339 --> 01:41:46.078
and then tossing the keys.

1850
01:41:46.098 --> 01:41:49.215
Well, that explained the dilemma
about where her key was


1851
01:41:49.235 --> 01:41:50.596
'cause her door was locked.

1852
01:41:50.616 --> 01:41:54.988
These were details that even
the most assiduous student


1853
01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:59.428
of the case would have had
a hard time coming up with


1854
01:41:59.448 --> 01:42:00.996
as some kind of fake story.

1855
01:42:01.016 --> 01:42:06.836
There was no question that
Reyes knew what had happened.


1856
01:42:06.856 --> 01:42:10.473
And his DNA was present on the
scene and the way in which


1857
01:42:10.493 --> 01:42:12.344
he committed this crime was
perfectly consistent with


1858
01:42:12.364 --> 01:42:14.679
the way he committed
other crimes.


1859
01:42:14.699 --> 01:42:16.581
It stands to reason
that Reyes was giving


1860
01:42:16.601 --> 01:42:18.322
an accurate statement.

1861
01:42:25.452 --> 01:42:26.916
McCray: I worked
the third shift.


1862
01:42:26.936 --> 01:42:30.231
It was from 8:00 to

1863
01:42:30.945 --> 01:42:33.836
I got home, got out of the
shower, about to watch


1864
01:42:33.856 --> 01:42:36.372
"Sportscenter," and
my cousin called.


1865
01:42:36.392 --> 01:42:38.941
She was like, "Tron,
Tron, turn on CNN."


1866
01:42:38.961 --> 01:42:40.410
And I'm like, "Why?
What's going on?"


1867
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:42.447
She was like, "The truth came out.
The truth came out."


1868
01:42:42.467 --> 01:42:43.780
"The truth came out? What
are you talking about?"


1869
01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.284
"Your case! Somebody
that did it,


1870
01:42:45.304 --> 01:42:48.587
he told the truth, he confessed.
He did it."


1871
01:42:48.607 --> 01:42:50.155
And I'm like,
"Are you serious?


1872
01:42:50.175 --> 01:42:51.957
"Are you serious?" And I
just started crying.


1873
01:42:51.977 --> 01:42:56.851
New DNA evidence conclusively
connects Reyes to the victim.


1874
01:42:56.871 --> 01:42:58.666
Santana, Sr.: My son
called me on a Saturday,


1875
01:42:58.686 --> 01:43:01.168
and I said, "I want
you to sit down."


1876
01:43:01.188 --> 01:43:02.684
I got news for you."

1877
01:43:03.339 --> 01:43:05.558
And he said, "What
news you got for me?"


1878
01:43:05.578 --> 01:43:07.276
"Get a chair, sit down.
I'm gonna tell you."


1879
01:43:07.296 --> 01:43:10.080
He says, "Oh, you know, they
found the guy that did it."


1880
01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:11.295
And I said, "What?"

1881
01:43:12.018 --> 01:43:14.383
And he says, "Yeah,
they found the guy that


1882
01:43:14.403 --> 01:43:16.514
committed your case."

1883
01:43:16.787 --> 01:43:19.291
And I said... man,
I gotta curse.


1884
01:43:19.311 --> 01:43:21.746
I said, "Get the fuck outta here."

1885
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:24.598
He said, "No, for real.
They found the guy."


1886
01:43:24.618 --> 01:43:26.490
"You're gonna be
comin' home soon."


1887
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:28.668
And I'm like, "Yeah, OK.
Whatever."


1888
01:43:28.688 --> 01:43:30.005
He's the only one
that has the hope.


1889
01:43:30.025 --> 01:43:32.440
But I'm like, "You know what?
I'll talk to you later."


1890
01:43:34.228 --> 01:43:36.380
It started raining outside.

1891
01:43:36.775 --> 01:43:39.994
And I'm looking out the
window, and I'm like,


1892
01:43:40.014 --> 01:43:42.559
"Damn. Did they really
find this dude?"


1893
01:43:43.507 --> 01:43:46.110
And I'm thinking about this.
Then I start crying.


1894
01:43:55.555 --> 01:43:58.005
Why are we here?
The Central Park five!


1895
01:43:58.025 --> 01:44:00.641
Why are we here?
The Central Park five!


1896
01:44:00.661 --> 01:44:02.048
In the snow!

1897
01:44:02.501 --> 01:44:05.224
Dwyer: There was a motion
by the defense to overturn


1898
01:44:05.411 --> 01:44:07.965
the convictions on the grounds
of newly discovered evidence.


1899
01:44:08.228 --> 01:44:12.852
And Morgenthau not only
said that the new evidence


1900
01:44:12.872 --> 01:44:14.533
likely would have led
to a different verdict,


1901
01:44:14.553 --> 01:44:19.997
he said to me and he said
to others, "If we knew then


1902
01:44:20.176 --> 01:44:25.770
what we know now, we wouldn't
have indicted these guys."


1903
01:44:26.953 --> 01:44:31.348
Koch: My faith in Robert
Morgenthau is such that I don't


1904
01:44:31.368 --> 01:44:33.401
quarrel with his decision.

1905
01:44:33.421 --> 01:44:34.637
Warren: This is step one.

1906
01:44:34.657 --> 01:44:38.008
The response from the district
attorney's office has been to


1907
01:44:38.028 --> 01:44:42.195
concede, or agree, or consent
to our application that


1908
01:44:42.215 --> 01:44:43.617
the verdicts be set aside.

1909
01:44:43.637 --> 01:44:47.053
The judge has to make a
formal ruling in that regard.


1910
01:44:47.250 --> 01:44:50.499
We expect for that ruling
to be made forthwith.


1911
01:44:52.197 --> 01:44:55.033
Dinkins: I wanna share
with you a statement from


1912
01:44:55.053 --> 01:44:58.206
District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau's office.


1913
01:44:58.939 --> 01:45:00.429
The office said,

1914
01:45:00.449 --> 01:45:05.227
"A comparison of the statement... statements,
reveals troubling discrepancies."


1915
01:45:06.241 --> 01:45:09.184
"Accounts given by the five
defendants differed from one


1916
01:45:09.204 --> 01:45:12.651
another on the specific
details of virtually every


1917
01:45:12.671 --> 01:45:14.838
major aspect of the crime:

1918
01:45:14.970 --> 01:45:16.688
Who initiated the attack;

1919
01:45:16.791 --> 01:45:18.349
Who knocked the victim down;

1920
01:45:18.369 --> 01:45:19.914
Who undressed her;
Who struck her;


1921
01:45:20.190 --> 01:45:21.843
Who held her;
Who raped her;


1922
01:45:21.956 --> 01:45:23.026
What weapons were used

1923
01:45:23.046 --> 01:45:24.638
in the course of the assault."

1924
01:45:24.658 --> 01:45:27.644
And went into the sequence
of events the attack took place.


1925
01:45:28.161 --> 01:45:31.259
And some of what they said
was simply contrary to


1926
01:45:31.279 --> 01:45:32.687
established fact.

1927
01:45:33.053 --> 01:45:36.503
Now, this is a damned shame.

1928
01:45:40.075 --> 01:45:42.073
Warren: I have an
application at this time


1929
01:45:42.093 --> 01:45:45.989
on the behalf of all of the
defendants: Korey Wise,


1930
01:45:46.009 --> 01:45:49.887
Yusef Salaam, Kevin
Richardson, Raymond Santana,


1931
01:45:49.907 --> 01:45:52.899
and Antron McCray, all the
indictments against each one


1932
01:45:52.919 --> 01:45:55.433
of them in their
entirety be dismissed.


1933
01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:57.039
Motion is granted.

1934
01:45:57.059 --> 01:46:00.692
Everyone have a very Merry
Christmas. Happy New Year.


1935
01:46:00.712 --> 01:46:01.828
Thank you!

1936
01:46:05.346 --> 01:46:07.961
Woman: The judge handling the review
of the Central Park jogger case


1937
01:46:07.981 --> 01:46:10.092
has just ruled in the
last hour that those


1938
01:46:10.112 --> 01:46:13.757
convictions against the five
young men must be set aside.


1939
01:46:13.777 --> 01:46:16.314
It is a stunning reversal in
one of the most controversial


1940
01:46:16.334 --> 01:46:18.673
crime cases in the
city's history.


1941
01:46:20.928 --> 01:46:24.975
That was the best Christmas,
ever... first... excuse me.


1942
01:46:24.995 --> 01:46:28.219
Best Christmas gift ever,
and me and my mother,


1943
01:46:28.239 --> 01:46:29.817
we just hugged each
other in our apartment


1944
01:46:29.837 --> 01:46:32.400
for seemed like forever.

1945
01:46:35.125 --> 01:46:36.891
That was a beautiful thing.

1946
01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.609
Still is.

1947
01:46:42.697 --> 01:46:45.032
I would always see these photos
of my mother walking around


1948
01:46:45.052 --> 01:46:47.777
with a "Yusef is
Innocent" shirt.


1949
01:46:47.797 --> 01:46:51.962
And then when they
dropped all the charges,


1950
01:46:52.222 --> 01:46:54.129
she had her coat open

1951
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:57.839
and the "Yusef is Innocent"
shirt on and this huge smile


1952
01:46:57.859 --> 01:47:02.055
on her face like, not only
did I told you so, but I'm


1953
01:47:02.075 --> 01:47:03.717
so happy today.

1954
01:47:06.036 --> 01:47:08.801
Woman: Now 4 of the 5 are out...
they served long prison terms,


1955
01:47:08.821 --> 01:47:10.910
but Raymond Santana
remains behind bars


1956
01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:12.566
on an unrelated conviction.

1957
01:47:12.586 --> 01:47:15.229
But the length of time that
he's serving on a drug charge


1958
01:47:15.249 --> 01:47:17.729
was based upon the fact that
he was a predicate felon,


1959
01:47:17.749 --> 01:47:19.972
his conviction in the
Central Park jogger case.


1960
01:47:19.992 --> 01:47:23.461
So lawyers close to the case representing
the five are telling me that they expect


1961
01:47:23.481 --> 01:47:26.650
to challenge that and try to
get Raymond Santana home to


1962
01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:28.939
his parents before Christmas.

1963
01:47:29.645 --> 01:47:31.291
Santana Jr.: It was celebration.

1964
01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:33.854
All the guys jumped around.
They, "Waaaa!"


1965
01:47:33.874 --> 01:47:35.422
They were all cheering.

1966
01:47:35.442 --> 01:47:39.253
"You goin' home. It's over.
You goin' home."


1967
01:47:39.273 --> 01:47:41.150
The correctional officer said,
"Well you know, there's a lot


1968
01:47:41.170 --> 01:47:42.686
of people out there."

1969
01:47:42.706 --> 01:47:45.160
"You wanna go through the back?
I'll get a car for you."


1970
01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:47.018
"You know, you can go
out the back way."


1971
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:49.020
And I said, "Well,
I'm a free man."


1972
01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:52.782
"I'm goin' out the front!
Open that door and let's go!"


1973
01:47:53.084 --> 01:47:56.230
Amid a crush of cameras,
Raymond Santana left jail


1974
01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:59.245
a free man, much to
his father's joy.


1975
01:47:59.265 --> 01:48:02.461
I always believed he was
innocent, from the beginning.


1976
01:48:03.696 --> 01:48:07.341
Santana Jr.: It took me back to
that perp walk that they do.


1977
01:48:07.361 --> 01:48:11.441
And then now this time,
it was a free man walk.


1978
01:48:11.461 --> 01:48:14.277
And it was definitely great to
walk through that, you know,


1979
01:48:14.297 --> 01:48:16.504
and to hold my head up high.

1980
01:48:16.524 --> 01:48:18.888
And I said, "I told you
we were innocent."


1981
01:48:20.655 --> 01:48:22.383
Santana, Sr.: This
is a miracle.


1982
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:26.734
And let me tell you, when I was
in that yard, I was saying


1983
01:48:26.754 --> 01:48:30.048
I need to pray for him a lot.

1984
01:48:31.316 --> 01:48:35.230
They say if your prayer don't
come out it did for me.


1985
01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:38.200
Because I pray a lot for
that kid, and look.


1986
01:48:39.182 --> 01:48:41.955
That was the happiest
day of my life, boy.


1987
01:48:50.266 --> 01:48:54.653
Wilder: I felt ashamed, actually,
for New York and I also felt


1988
01:48:54.673 --> 01:49:00.111
extremely angry, because
their innocence never got


1989
01:49:00.131 --> 01:49:02.186
the attention that their guilt did.

1990
01:49:02.628 --> 01:49:09.093
The furor around prosecuting
them still drowns out


1991
01:49:09.966 --> 01:49:11.947
the good news of
their innocence.


1992
01:49:12.192 --> 01:49:20.484
These were 5 kids who we
tormented, we falsely accused,


1993
01:49:21.001 --> 01:49:26.536
we pilloried in the press,
we attacked, we invented


1994
01:49:26.556 --> 01:49:29.976
phrases for the imagined
crimes that we're


1995
01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.649
accusing them of.

1996
01:49:32.306 --> 01:49:34.637
And then we put them in jail.

1997
01:49:34.832 --> 01:49:36.651
We falsely convicted them.

1998
01:49:36.764 --> 01:49:39.401
And when the evidence
turned out that they were


1999
01:49:39.421 --> 01:49:45.995
innocent and they were
released, we gave a modest nod


2000
01:49:46.596 --> 01:49:50.174
to fairness, and we walked
away from our crime.


2001
01:49:50.434 --> 01:49:55.658
It was a more interesting
story when it was all about


2002
01:49:55.789 --> 01:50:00.260
a white woman that was
raped by 5 black boys.


2003
01:50:00.610 --> 01:50:09.324
The coverage in 2002 was worse
than what had happened in 1989.


2004
01:50:10.005 --> 01:50:15.819
More resistant to
fact, more obstinate


2005
01:50:16.393 --> 01:50:18.070
about being wrong.

2006
01:50:20.737 --> 01:50:24.924
The police department
commissioned this panel led by


2007
01:50:24.944 --> 01:50:27.148
a very distinguished lawyer
named Mike Armstrong,


2008
01:50:27.289 --> 01:50:30.405
to review what had happened
in the jogger case.


2009
01:50:30.425 --> 01:50:32.762
And the police department
found that the police


2010
01:50:32.782 --> 01:50:35.213
department had done nothing
wrong even though it had let


2011
01:50:35.233 --> 01:50:38.124
the right man get away and
apparently had put the wrong


2012
01:50:38.144 --> 01:50:39.538
people in prison.

2013
01:50:40.983 --> 01:50:45.425
This was institutional
protectionism that was going on.


2014
01:50:47.867 --> 01:50:51.988
Hancock: Linda Fairstein made a
huge name for herself in part


2015
01:50:52.008 --> 01:50:53.764
because of this case.

2016
01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:56.949
It was extremely important
to her profession


2017
01:50:56.969 --> 01:50:59.073
and her reputation.

2018
01:51:06.017 --> 01:51:10.757
So she's got a lot to lose by
saying, "I got everything wrong"


2019
01:51:10.777 --> 01:51:13.411
"and I railroaded these
kids into jail."


2020
01:51:15.138 --> 01:51:18.872
Whatever you do in life,
you make mistakes,


2021
01:51:19.576 --> 01:51:22.374
and you either face your
mistakes or you don't.


2022
01:51:23.595 --> 01:51:26.797
I don't think the press
faced its mistakes.


2023
01:51:30.073 --> 01:51:32.384
I don't think the police
department faced the truth


2024
01:51:32.404 --> 01:51:35.697
of what had happened because
the truth of what had happened


2025
01:51:35.717 --> 01:51:37.217
is almost unbearable.

2026
01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:42.227
By prosecuting the wrong
people for the Central Park


2027
01:51:42.247 --> 01:51:47.279
jogger case, Matias Reyes
continued to hurt,


2028
01:51:47.299 --> 01:51:49.179
maim, and kill.

2029
01:51:49.781 --> 01:51:54.101
And they could have had
him but they got stuck


2030
01:51:54.298 --> 01:51:55.444
with a mistake.

2031
01:51:56.119 --> 01:51:58.861
And they're still
invested in that mistake.


2032
01:52:00.155 --> 01:52:01.949
Patricia Meili...

2033
01:52:04.888 --> 01:52:07.311
My brother, all the boys,

2034
01:52:07.571 --> 01:52:09.485
all of our families...

2035
01:52:10.339 --> 01:52:12.170
all of us are victims.

2036
01:52:15.555 --> 01:52:20.145
Nobody wants to look at the
damage, the terror that they


2037
01:52:20.165 --> 01:52:22.135
put my family through.

2038
01:52:22.155 --> 01:52:25.133
Nobody wants to take
responsibility.


2039
01:52:26.072 --> 01:52:29.497
I want us to remember what
happened that day and be


2040
01:52:29.517 --> 01:52:33.509
horrified by ourselves because
it really is a mirror


2041
01:52:33.737 --> 01:52:35.117
on our society.

2042
01:52:35.343 --> 01:52:38.806
And rather than tying it up
in a bow and thinking that


2043
01:52:38.826 --> 01:52:40.805
there was something that
we can take away from it


2044
01:52:40.825 --> 01:52:43.980
and we'll be better people, I
think what we really need to


2045
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.582
realize is that we're
not very good people.


2046
01:52:47.225 --> 01:52:48.881
And we're often not.

2047
01:52:59.626 --> 01:53:01.250
Santana Jr.: I'm
always behind.


2048
01:53:02.114 --> 01:53:04.979
Those years that it took
from me, I lost a lot.


2049
01:53:04.999 --> 01:53:09.323
And even now at the age
of 36 where I should be


2050
01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:14.107
fully in a career, have a
house, a car, maybe married,


2051
01:53:14.127 --> 01:53:15.989
I don't have any of that.

2052
01:53:16.273 --> 01:53:18.770
And so I don't know how to
regain that stuff anymore.


2053
01:53:18.967 --> 01:53:20.488
So I'm just here.

2054
01:53:23.042 --> 01:53:25.812
I lost my youth.

2055
01:53:26.908 --> 01:53:29.092
I lost 7 years of my life.

2056
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:38.614
I lost that sense of being
youthful and missing the


2057
01:53:38.634 --> 01:53:43.333
average things of going to
school and going to the prom


2058
01:53:43.353 --> 01:53:46.548
and just livin' like average

2059
01:53:54.159 --> 01:53:56.657
Wise: You can forgive
but you won't forget.


2060
01:53:58.057 --> 01:54:00.040
You won't forget
what you done lost.


2061
01:54:02.632 --> 01:54:05.796
No money could bring
that time back.


2062
01:54:06.506 --> 01:54:11.294
No money could bring the life
that was missin' or the time


2063
01:54:11.314 --> 01:54:13.365
that was taken
away bring back.


2064
01:54:14.405 --> 01:54:15.830
Nothin'.

2065
01:54:18.093 --> 01:54:21.952
Salaam: It hasn't become
easier to live as an adult.


2066
01:54:21.972 --> 01:54:23.280
It's become harder.

2067
01:54:24.718 --> 01:54:28.743
It's always more difficult to
do something if you have this


2068
01:54:28.763 --> 01:54:31.725
huge gap of your life
taken away from you.


2069
01:54:32.701 --> 01:54:36.039
And it's not like just because
they said, "OK, we're


2070
01:54:36.059 --> 01:54:40.077
vacating the convictions", that
that vacated the whole prison term.


2071
01:54:40.246 --> 01:54:42.161
That whole prison
term happened.


2072
01:54:42.311 --> 01:54:45.157
It was a reality. We
really went through that.


2073
01:54:51.141 --> 01:54:53.047
McCray: I still
struggle every day,


2074
01:54:53.701 --> 01:54:55.670
but I made it, you know.

2075
01:54:55.690 --> 01:54:57.516
Came home, didn't
get in trouble.


2076
01:54:57.879 --> 01:54:59.797
Worked ever since I came home.

2077
01:55:00.101 --> 01:55:02.745
Pay taxes, take
care of my kids.


2078
01:55:04.510 --> 01:55:06.243
I'm doing the best I can, so...

2079
01:55:07.396 --> 01:55:10.994
I told them I was going to make it.
Told 'em.


2080
01:55:11.973 --> 01:55:13.749
The truth came out.

2081
01:55:14.890 --> 01:55:16.580
Truth came out.
