<i>A boy with a

<i>I was wearing my seat belt.</i>

51
00:02:56.797 --> 00:02:58.580
Dad?

52
00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.390
Mom!

53
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.904
<i>Mama and Daddy weren't.</i>

54
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.456
Mama! Dad!

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.030
Mommy! Dad!

56
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.583
Let's get you out of here.

57
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.200
<i>It was during
my eighth Christmas</i>


58
00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:18.700
<i>that I lost
my mother and father.</i>


59
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.200
My dear child...

60
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.643
Grandma.

61
00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:33.650
Grandma's here.

62
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.410
You gonna be all right.

63
00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:45.040
Here, let me look at you.

64
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.280
Mmm.

65
00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:51.240
I'mma get you out of here.

66
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.540
I packed your things.

67
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.990
I'm gonna take you home.

68
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.454
Home? To my house?

69
00:03:58.298 --> 00:03:59.670
No, darling.

70
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.580
Home to my house.

71
00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:19.270
Need any help bringing
these bags inside, sister?


72
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.023
Oh! No, thank you, Reginald.

73
00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:22.450
You've done enough already.

74
00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:25.130
Running into you at
the bus station was a godsend.


75
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.529
I'm much obliged.

76
00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:28.200
My pleasure.

77
00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.890
I'll see you in church
come Sunday?


78
00:04:29.983 --> 00:04:31.620
Oh, you know you will.

79
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.360
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance, young man.


80
00:04:36.482 --> 00:04:37.740
Welcome to Demopolis.

81
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:39.510
- Thank you, Reggie.
- Sister.


82
00:04:42.647 --> 00:04:43.600
Wait!

83
00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:46.180
Take them shoes off before
you walk on my good rug.


84
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.787
<i>Grandma was my mama's mama.</i>

85
00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.620
<i>A tough lady with a big heart.</i>

86
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.616
<i>The kind that wouldn't hesitate</i>

87
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.656
<i>to give a spanking
if you deserve it</i>


88
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.450
<i>or a big ol' hug
if you needed it.</i>


89
00:05:03.652 --> 00:05:04.990
I reckon.

90
00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:09.280
You'll be comfy here.

91
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.190
In your mama's old room.

92
00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:18.990
We'll get you situated tomorrow.

93
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.788
I'm gonna make
some hot chocolate.


94
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.696
Want some?

95
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.600
I'm gonna make some anyway...

96
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.450
in case you change
your mind.


97
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.491
<i>High tomorrow, 73.</i>

98
00:06:14.548 --> 00:06:16.722
Young man,
what is wrong with you?


99
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.510
Sitting in here all
by your lonesome.


100
00:06:18.595 --> 00:06:19.910
It's nice out.

101
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.370
You want something to eat?

102
00:06:25.494 --> 00:06:27.120
I just fried some wings.

103
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.543
Nobody turns down my wings.

104
00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:32.030
I'm gonna make you a plate.

What you waiting for?

119
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.315
Don't feel like eating.

120
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.780
And I don't feel like wasting
all this good food.


121
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.440
What, you think I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you?


122
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.863
Well, I don't.

123
00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:15.522
Do I feel bad?

124
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.660
Yeah.

125
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.160
But not sorry.

126
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.476
Sometimes, whatever the good
Lord needs to teach us.


127
00:08:22.548 --> 00:08:24.200
Comes in ways we don't see.

128
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.570
But it doesn't mean we're
not supposed to learn something.


129
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.065
Look here.

130
00:08:32.308 --> 00:08:33.870
This was my baby.

131
00:08:35.489 --> 00:08:38.120
I'd do anything for her
to be here right now.


132
00:08:38.647 --> 00:08:41.960
But the Man Above
had another plan for her.


133
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.112
And whether it seems fair to me
or not, it doesn't matter.


134
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.640
Sometimes life isn't fair.

135
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.261
It's a hard lesson
for folks to learn


136
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.980
and most people don't have
to learn it this young.


137
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.920
But you do.

138
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.905
You hear me?

139
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.357
Come on now, baby.

140
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.030
You got to eat something.

141
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.720
You like cake?

142
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.468
Well, corn bread
is basically cake.


143
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.770
Mmm-hmm.

144
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.970
Go on. Try it.

145
00:10:01.418 --> 00:10:03.060
What's his name?

146
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.850
It's a she.

147
00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:07.310
Her name is something
you can ponder.


148
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.080
Have you come up with a name
for your mouse yet?


149
00:10:25.202 --> 00:10:26.204
Uh-huh.

150
00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:27.390
Well, tell me.

151
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.660
Don't be keeping me
in suspense.


152
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.270
Aisy.

153
00:10:31.376 --> 00:10:32.560
Lazy?

154
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.100
Well, that mouse
is full of nothing but energy.


155
00:10:35.216 --> 00:10:37.060
She runs all the
time in that wheel.


156
00:10:37.188 --> 00:10:38.560
Not "lazy."

157
00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:40.160
Daisy.

158
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.534
"Daisy." Oh.

159
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.703
I like it.

160
00:10:45.197 --> 00:10:47.310
That's a perfect name for her.

161
00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:48.930
Close your eyes, honey.

Raymond.

187
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.197
You call these fresh?

188
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:12.370
But we just got them in.

189
00:12:12.454 --> 00:12:13.912
When? Last year?

190
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.296
Look at how yellow they are.

191
00:12:15.381 --> 00:12:17.370
And those brown
spots around the edges.


192
00:12:17.602 --> 00:12:19.320
I'm not gonna waste
good bacon drippings


193
00:12:19.412 --> 00:12:21.038
on these shriveled-up weeds.

194
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.324
Can you get me some
fresh greens if you don't mind?


195
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.411
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:25.600
I'll see what we
have in the back.


197
00:12:25.682 --> 00:12:26.780
You do that.

198
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.185
Grandma,
can I get these nails


199
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.456
to make Daisy a house?

200
00:12:33.748 --> 00:12:35.740
Well, these aren't galvanized.

201
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:37.120
You have to use galvanized nails

202
00:12:37.203 --> 00:12:38.412
so they won't rust.

203
00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:40.530
But galvanized
costs .35 cents more.


204
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.912
Safety first.

205
00:12:42.124 --> 00:12:42.990
Yes, ma'am.

206
00:12:43.108 --> 00:12:45.560
You cut yourself on a rusty nail,
you can get lockjaw.


207
00:12:45.658 --> 00:12:46.302
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.070
And then I'd have to
flush out your system


209
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.270
with liver oil, garlic juice,
tabasco sauce.


210
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.010
You wouldn't want to go
through that now, would you?


211
00:12:52.101 --> 00:12:53.070
No, ma'am.

212
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.620
Good.
Remember, safety first.


213
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.929
<i>Grandma knew how</i>

214
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.704
<i>to fix all kinds of ailments.</i>

215
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.576
<i>She learned from her grandma,</i>

216
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.322
<i>how to use
herbs and potions</i>


217
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.350
<i>and strange incantations</i>

218
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.628
<i>to make sick people
good as new.</i>


219
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.357
<i>Here in Alabama,
where she grew up.</i>


220
00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:14.030
<i>Grandma was known
as a healer.</i>


221
00:13:14.225 --> 00:13:15.640
Galvanized.

222
00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:20.990
Boy!

223
00:13:22.609 --> 00:13:24.820
Boy.

224
00:13:26.821 --> 00:13:31.420
Do you like sweets?

225
00:13:35.762 --> 00:13:38.120
She is tame.

226
00:13:39.437 --> 00:13:42.990
Very sweet.

227
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.828
Give her a kiss.

228
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.402
Young man.

229
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.555
You want those nails, you
better come on...


230
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.423
Yes, Raymond,
that's more like it.


231
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.760
Grandma, I need
to tell you something!


232
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.002
Not now, son.

233
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.490
But, Grandma...

234
00:14:17.677 --> 00:14:19.330
I thought you
wanted those nails.


235
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.028
Forget it. Let's just go.

236
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.690
Yeah.

237
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.844
Let's just go.

238
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.730
Hey.

239
00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:41.590
Son, what were
you trying to tell me


240
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.760
in the grocery
store this morning?


241
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.810
You were shaking like a leaf.

242
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.440
Don't worry about that,
Grandma.


243
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.900
I just want you to feel better.

244
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.980
I feel fine.

245
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.640
You just tell me
what you were trying to say.


246
00:14:53.729 --> 00:14:55.980
Looked like you were about
to have a conniption fit.


247
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.245
I don't know what I saw.

248
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.937
It was a scary lady.

249
00:15:02.162 --> 00:15:03.412
She called to me.

250
00:15:03.668 --> 00:15:06.280
But when she did,
when she talked,


251
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.303
her mouth...

252
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.120
Was she wearing gloves?

253
00:15:10.331 --> 00:15:12.700
Long ones, up to her elbows?

254
00:15:13.649 --> 00:15:15.160
Was she wearing a hat?

255
00:15:16.552 --> 00:15:17.860
It looked like she had a towel

256
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.272
on her head or something.

257
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.244
And when she
talked, did her voice


258
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.870
sound ugly and scratchy
like an outhouse door


259
00:15:23.969 --> 00:15:25.620
swinging on a rusty hinge?

260
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.079
Oh.

261
00:15:29.282 --> 00:15:31.080
I feared this was happening.

262
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.280
That lady you saw in
the grocery store was no lady.


263
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.040
What you saw was a witch.

264
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.062
A witch?

265
00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:45.160
That's right.

266
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.640
A no-good, rotten, low-down,

267
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.569
sneaky, sneaky witch.

268
00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:51.660
Okay. Okay.

269
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.320
Is this you and
your church friends


270
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.760
trying to play a joke on me?

271
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.580
'Cause if it is,
it's not very funny.


272
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.910
Listen, child.

273
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.138
Witches ain't
nothing to joke about.


274
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.202
I've known children
who no longer exist


275
00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:05.160
as children on this earth.

276
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.160
They were turned, transformed,

277
00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:10.030
taken by witches.

278
00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:15.183
I can tell you
about Alice Blue.


279
00:16:16.764 --> 00:16:20.110
<i>Well, Alice Blue and I
were best friends.</i>


280
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.810
<i>We lived across the
street from each other.</i>


281
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.454
We were like sisters.

282
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.122
Inseparable.
We did everything together,


283
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.590
even our chores.

284
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.111
<i>But Alice was a lollygagger.</i>

285
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.480
Alice, quit lollygagging, girl.

286
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.480
It's almost suppertime.

287
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.971
<i>Alice did something</i>

288
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:54.990
<i>no child should ever do.</i>

289
00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:57.400
<i>She took candy from
a stranger.</i>


290
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.890
<i>I got so scared, I
tore out of there</i>


291
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.060
like greased lightning,
and hightailed it straight home.


292
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.480
I never should
have left Alice alone.


293
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.261
I knew I shouldn't have.

294
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.278
But I was so scared.

295
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.051
<i>Later that night...</i>

296
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.090
<i>when I saw Alice alive.</i>

297
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.700
<i>I was as happy as a mouse</i>

298
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.180
<i>in a bucket of cheese.</i>

299
00:17:26.002 --> 00:17:27.940
But the very next morning,

300
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.712
all that happiness went away

301
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.005
because it happened.

302
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.112
She started turning.

303
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.000
Alice was chicken-afied.

304
00:18:14.534 --> 00:18:15.597
Chicken-alified.

305
00:18:19.903 --> 00:18:20.960
Lordy!

306
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.230
Look at the size
of that chicken.


307
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.119
Y'all seen where Alice run off to?

308
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.042
She's right... there.

309
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.155
What you talking about, child?

310
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.564
Where'd she go?

311
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.720
<i>I tried to explain
what I saw,</i>


312
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.397
<i>but everybody was looking</i>

313
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.819
<i>at me like I was crazy.</i>

314
00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:41.169
Finally, I just
shut up about it.


315
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.378
Although, I made it
a point to visit Alice


316
00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:46.120
in her coop every day.

317
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.229
Hi, Alice.

318
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.776
Alice even laid eggs.

319
00:19:00.364 --> 00:19:02.120
Big green ones.

320
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.783
Biggest green eggs I ever seen.

321
00:19:05.512 --> 00:19:07.950
People said they were delicious.

322
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.562
What about the witch?

323
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.720
What about her?

324
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.877
Did she go away?

325
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.327
Oh, my, no.

326
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.741
Once a witch come
into your life, it never...


327
00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:24.390
Never...
Oh, my Lord in Heaven.


328
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.741
What am I thinking?

329
00:19:26.981 --> 00:19:29.270
I just told you we
saw a witch today.


330
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.685
A witch in the grocery store.

331
00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.898
And what am I doing?

332
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.807
Sitting here like
I'm blind in one eye


333
00:19:34.929 --> 00:19:36.430
and can't see out the other,

334
00:19:36.628 --> 00:19:39.660
wasting precious time
lollygagging.


335
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.545
<i>Always wondered,</i>

336
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.700
<i>what Grandma kept in
that locked closet.</i>


337
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.430
<i>Turns out it was full of
medicinal herbs and elixirs</i>


338
00:19:53.577 --> 00:19:55.740
<i>and old books
about ancient healing.</i>


339
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.580
<i>Now, my mom always
said Grandma was sort of</i>


340
00:20:01.677 --> 00:20:03.020
<i>a country-type healer.</i>

341
00:20:03.178 --> 00:20:05.310
<i>But now I was
starting to think,</i>


342
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.529
<i>she might be a
voodoo priestess.</i>


343
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.308
Child, we need to leave.

344
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.720
Leave?

345
00:20:11.837 --> 00:20:13.240
That's right, leave.

346
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.890
It's not safe for us here.

347
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.270
But where we gonna go?

348
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.230
I'll call my cousin, Eston.

349
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.171
Have him make
a reservation for us


350
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.472
at the Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel.


351
00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.570
He was the executive chef
there for over 30 years.


352
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.087
He's got pull there.

353
00:20:28.218 --> 00:20:29.570
He's a star.

354
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.100
His cooking put that
hotel on the map.


355
00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:35.668
It's the swankiest resort

356
00:20:35.752 --> 00:20:37.020
in all of Alabama.

357
00:20:37.178 --> 00:20:38.320
You'll be telling your grandkids

358
00:20:38.407 --> 00:20:39.990
about your stay in this hotel.

359
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:43.140
How do you
know we'll be safe there?


360
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.830
Because, child. Ain't nothing

361
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.350
but rich white folks at the
Grand Orleans Imperial Island Hotel.


362
00:20:48.661 --> 00:20:50.760
And witches
only prey on the poor,


363
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.145
the overlooked,
the kids they think


364
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.430
nobody's gonna make a fuss
about if they go missing.


365
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520
Go pack!

366
00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:07.340
Grandma, are there
witches in every city?


367
00:21:07.776 --> 00:21:08.940
Every city,

368
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.736
every state, every country.

369
00:21:10.943 --> 00:21:12.780
And there's a secret
society of witches


370
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.030
in every country called a coven.

371
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.030
That's just like a Rotary Club
but for witches.


372
00:21:18.924 --> 00:21:20.580
They all get
together in one place


373
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.717
and gossip about
who they put spells on


374
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.985
or trade potion
secrets and whatnot.


375
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.672
But most important,
they receive orders


376
00:21:27.762 --> 00:21:29.120
from the Grand High Witch.

377
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.957
The Grand High Witch?

378
00:21:31.075 --> 00:21:33.030
The Grand High Witch.

379
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.042
She's the ruler of them all.

380
00:21:35.555 --> 00:21:37.780
All-powerful, pure evil

381
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.990
and without a
stitch of mercy.


382
00:21:40.195 --> 00:21:42.620
Yeah. Legend has it,
she was hatched


383
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.870
on the frozen tundra of Norway.

384
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.697
Now, take a look at that.

385
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.828
What, you just gonna stand there
and stare at me all day?


386
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.320
Can I help you?

387
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.482
You can unload this car while I
check in to this here hotel.


388
00:22:16.745 --> 00:22:17.830
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.280
Here's the key.

390
00:22:21.451 --> 00:22:24.330
- Oh, and...
- No.


391
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:26.700
You keep your money, ma'am.

392
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.557
And enjoy yourself.

393
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.031
I think I will.

394
00:22:31.235 --> 00:22:33.610
<i>Grandma was right about this hotel.</i>

395
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.410
<i>It sure was fancy.</i>

396
00:22:35.611 --> 00:22:37.700
<i>She brought us to
the Gulf of Mexico</i>


397
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.740
<i>to get away from that witch.</i>

398
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.360
<i>But she had no idea what</i>

399
00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:44.740
<i>we were about to step into.</i>

400
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.651
Be careful with the mouse.

401
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.477
No.

402
00:22:50.576 --> 00:22:52.300
For God's sake, I think you're
being extremely unreasonable.


403
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.722
No, Deidre. For the last time,
I will not have that woman in my house.


404
00:22:54.802 --> 00:22:57.130
- Oh, she's very good company.
- Absolutely not, Deidre.


405
00:22:57.301 --> 00:22:58.680
Oh, for God's sake.

406
00:22:58.783 --> 00:23:00.540
Bruno, your face.

407
00:23:01.428 --> 00:23:03.580
Obviously can't
take you anywhere.


408
00:23:06.689 --> 00:23:08.402
Here you are, ma'am.

409
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.590
Come on, we got our key.

410
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.530
We are in room 766.

411
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.320
Sounds like a good room.

412
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.176
You okay, Grandma?

413
00:23:26.341 --> 00:23:28.700
That's the first time you coughed
since we left the house.


414
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.496
Can I help you, madam?

415
00:23:30.623 --> 00:23:33.360
Oh! You must be Eston's cousins.

416
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.530
Yes, he insisted that
you stay in room 766.


417
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.964
That's the Magnolia.

418
00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:40.950
This is one of our most
lovely junior suites.


419
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.562
And aren't you a
lucky fella? Hmm?


420
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.647
It's not every day that
a young gentleman


421
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.209
such as yourself is fortunate

422
00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:54.530
to come and stay in such
a fine hotel as this now, is it?


423
00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.802
Come on, Gatsby.

424
00:23:56.954 --> 00:23:58.038
Let's go.

425
00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.329
Let's go find our room.

426
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.934
Would you like me to show you?

427
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.689
- It's on the fourth floor.
- Mmm.


428
00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:04.590
Grandma, if we're on
the fourth floor.


429
00:24:04.704 --> 00:24:06.329
Why is it number 7-6-6?

430
00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:08.680
Because the man who built
this hotel was a numerologist.


431
00:24:08.788 --> 00:24:10.530
He believed numbers
have meaning.


432
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.704
I know a little something
about numbers.


433
00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:15.410
Seven and six together
means a test is coming.


434
00:24:15.536 --> 00:24:17.450
Two sixes mean abundance.

435
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.889
So, it look like a big test
might be coming.


436
00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:44.910
Well, hello there.

437
00:24:45.103 --> 00:24:47.720
The Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel.


438
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.860
Welcome you and your
lovely group of benefactresses.


439
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.428
I would just like to say

440
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.522
that we applaud
your innumerable.


441
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.447
Philanthropic...

442
00:24:58.802 --> 00:25:01.660
acts and, um...

443
00:25:05.495 --> 00:25:07.245
And, um...

444
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.896
I'm sorry, madam,
but the hotel has


445
00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:13.430
a very strict no-pet policy.

446
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.540
You seem like
the sort of man.


447
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.418
Who loves a precious.

448
00:25:17.536 --> 00:25:18.800
Don't you, Mister...

449
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.691
Stringer. R. J. Stringer III.
Hotel Manager.


450
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.715
Thank you for
making an exception,


451
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.170
- Mr. R. J. The Hotel Manager.
- Stringer.


452
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.844
Yes, but I haven't yet...

453
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:27.970
But I didn't agree...

454
00:25:28.035 --> 00:25:31.155
So, tell me something,
Mister...


455
00:25:31.451 --> 00:25:32.450
Stringy?

456
00:25:32.542 --> 00:25:34.487
- Stringer.
- Hotel man.


457
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640
- Manager.
- The third.


458
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.370
Yeah.

459
00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:38.280
I know you love kitties.

460
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:46.185
But what do you think of... mice?

461
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.409
Mice?

462
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.450
Yeah. Mice.

463
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.832
What would you
do if there were mice


464
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.487
running all around
in this hotel?


465
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.000
Well, I can assure you, madam.

466
00:25:59.117 --> 00:26:00.910
There would never
be any mice...


467
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.315
But if there were?

468
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.440
Hypothetically?

469
00:26:04.537 --> 00:26:07.079
Mmm. Oh, hypothetically.

470
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.922
Yes, I suppose,
well, I would, uh...


471
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.544
I would call the exterminator.

472
00:26:12.025 --> 00:26:13.320
Exactly!

473
00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:16.148
You see, girls?

474
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.534
He would call the exterminator!

475
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.844
Just like any normal human
with his head screwed on right.


476
00:26:25.014 --> 00:26:27.860
He would exterminate group
of benefactresses!


477
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.162
Uh... Rats.

478
00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:35.630
We would exterminate the rats.

479
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.880
Evil.

480
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.856
There's no other
way to describe them.


481
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.007
Pure, unvarnished evil.

482
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.515
That's what witches are.

483
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.512
Now, you see
this here cough of mine?


484
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.564
It was likely brought
on by a witch.


485
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.936
Probably that one you saw
in the grocery store.


486
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.007
Really? A witch can
make you cough?


487
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.014
Oh, you bet your
sweet patootie they can.


488
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.891
Grandma, how can you tell
a real witch from a normal lady?


489
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.300
Well, first of all.

490
00:27:10.402 --> 00:27:12.660
Witches aren't
really women at all.


491
00:27:12.858 --> 00:27:15.570
They're demons in human shape.

492
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.355
That's why if you
look closely at a witch.


493
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.776
You'll notice the corners
of her mouth is elongated.


494
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.696
Stretching almost up to her ears

495
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.300
and that's usually hidden
with pancake makeup.


496
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.539
And a real witch always
wears gloves. Always.


497
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.512
Because a real witch
doesn't have hands.


498
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.731
She's got claws.

499
00:27:34.797 --> 00:27:35.797
Claws?

500
00:27:38.355 --> 00:27:40.780
And they don't have toes. Ooh.

501
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.548
Their ugly feet look like

502
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.840
their toes got chopped
off with an axe.


503
00:27:45.442 --> 00:27:47.320
And all witches are bald.

504
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.738
As bald as a boiled egg.

505
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.263
So, they wear wigs.

506
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.484
And it gives them nasty sores.

507
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.050
"Wig rash" the witches call it.

508
00:27:57.795 --> 00:27:59.360
And it makes them crazy.

509
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.927
So gloves, wigs.

510
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.254
Is that everything?

511
00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.571
Nose-holes.

512
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.576
- Nose-holes?
- Yeah. Nostrils.


513
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.972
Nose-holes.

514
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.908
Witches have larger nose-holes
than normal people.


515
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.322
When they need
to sniff out a child,


516
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.557
those nose-holes
can grow out as big as


517
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.370
eight inches in diameter.

518
00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.263
But, mind you.

519
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.320
Children smell horrible
to witches.


520
00:28:23.536 --> 00:28:25.280
Even if the kid
just had a bath?


521
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.700
That makes it worse.

522
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.856
A freshly clean kid smells

523
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.371
like dog poop to a witch.

524
00:28:31.517 --> 00:28:32.517
Dog poop?

525
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.602
That's right.

526
00:28:33.757 --> 00:28:35.430
And the cleaner the kid.

527
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.338
The poopier he smells
to a witch.


528
00:28:37.428 --> 00:28:39.530
Maybe I should
stop taking baths.


529
00:28:39.654 --> 00:28:40.740
Child, don't test me.

530
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.437
Can a witch come in here

531
00:28:43.517 --> 00:28:45.245
and get us
while we sleep?


532
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.635
No.

533
00:28:48.025 --> 00:28:49.820
Not at all.

534
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.463
Witches never
do silly things like


535
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.590
climbing drainpipes or

536
00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:56.540
breaking into people's houses.

537
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.992
Besides, they have
no idea where we are.


538
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.277
Okay, but I'm
still a little scared.


539
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.680
Over here,
come on, little man.


540
00:29:07.075 --> 00:29:08.600
There we go.

541
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.700
Get some sleep.

542
00:30:00.934 --> 00:30:02.060
Hmm?

543
00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:06.962
Really?

544
00:30:25.395 --> 00:30:26.490
Mmm.

545
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.020
<i>The next morning,</i>

546
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:39.000
<i>the sun was shining and
the air was crisp and clear.</i>


547
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.557
<i>I kept quiet as a mouse</i>

548
00:30:40.647 --> 00:30:42.380
<i>so Grandma could sleep in,</i>

549
00:30:42.614 --> 00:30:45.030
<i>and I took it upon
myself to order her</i>


550
00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.632
<i>some room service breakfast.</i>

551
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.360
Here's your breakfast, Grandma.

552
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.522
Scrambled eggs,
chicken fried steak,


553
00:30:55.658 --> 00:30:57.990
hominy grits, pecan sticky buns,

554
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.515
rhubarb strawberry jam
and a pitcher


555
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.844
of sweet iced tea with mint.

556
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.733
Oh, that sure smells special.

557
00:31:06.487 --> 00:31:08.820
Oh, mercy, I slept in late.

558
00:31:11.945 --> 00:31:14.520
Well, thank you for ordering
me breakfast, darling.


559
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.160
I gave the room service guy
a half a dollar tip.


560
00:31:17.324 --> 00:31:18.244
Was that okay?

561
00:31:18.312 --> 00:31:19.690
That's mighty
gentlemanly of you.


562
00:31:22.275 --> 00:31:23.275
Grandma, are you okay?

563
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.957
I'm fine.
Just a little tickle.


564
00:31:25.108 --> 00:31:27.770
Grab Grandma that
glass of tea.


565
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.378
And listen, Grandma's gonna
take it easy today.


566
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.870
But I want you to get outside
and run around.


567
00:31:34.096 --> 00:31:35.390
Go down to the water.

568
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:36.830
Have fun.

569
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.435
I was thinking I would do
some training with Daisy.


570
00:31:40.538 --> 00:31:42.430
Oh! Well, take her with.

571
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.604
Just don't let her get
too close to the water.


572
00:31:44.717 --> 00:31:46.140
I wouldn't want some
big old sea snake


573
00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.296
to grab a hold of her.

574
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.630
Sea snake?

575
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.720
I'm just joshing.

576
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.211
There ain't no sea snakes.

577
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.011
You go on now. Have fun.

578
00:31:54.157 --> 00:31:55.390
And don't worry about me.

579
00:31:55.512 --> 00:31:56.730
I'm fine.

580
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.225
<i>Even though I knew Grandma
was kidding about the sea snakes.</i>


581
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.797
<i>I didn't wanna take any chances,</i>

582
00:32:02.924 --> 00:32:04.595
<i>so we stayed inside.</i>

583
00:32:04.905 --> 00:32:06.450
<i>And wouldn't you know,</i>

584
00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.574
<i>we came upon the big ballroom
where it turns out</i>


585
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.458
<i>the International Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty</i>


586
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.540
<i>to Children folks
were gonna have</i>


587
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:15.887
<i>their conference.</i>

588
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.517
Hey!

589
00:32:22.287 --> 00:32:23.746
You there!

590
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.120
And what are you doing?

591
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.527
Breaking and entering?

592
00:32:27.611 --> 00:32:29.040
Looking for a quiet spot.

593
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.200
For what?

594
00:32:30.336 --> 00:32:31.330
Training.

595
00:32:31.461 --> 00:32:32.720
Training what?

596
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.330
Cool. Super.

597
00:32:36.435 --> 00:32:37.780
What's his name?

598
00:32:38.077 --> 00:32:39.140
It's a she.

599
00:32:39.268 --> 00:32:40.787
And her name is Daisy.

600
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.637
Can I hold her?

601
00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:46.490
She's not too comfortable
around strangers.


602
00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.760
Can she do any
tricks or anything?


603
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.216
We were just about
to do some training.


604
00:32:51.301 --> 00:32:52.450
Wanna watch?

605
00:32:52.632 --> 00:32:53.870
What time is it?

606
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.490
A nice lady told me
to meet her here at 12:25.


607
00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.170
She said she would give me

608
00:32:59.268 --> 00:33:00.954
six bars of Swiss chocolate.

609
00:33:01.178 --> 00:33:02.200
What's your name?

610
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.898
- I'm...
- Bruno Jenkins!


611
00:33:04.124 --> 00:33:06.010
I've been looking for you
everywhere, young man.


612
00:33:06.105 --> 00:33:08.390
Your father is furious.

613
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.680
Hello, Mother.

614
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.280
This is my new friend.

615
00:33:11.505 --> 00:33:12.950
Nice to meet you.

616
00:33:13.465 --> 00:33:15.800
Look at your
hands, they're filthy!


617
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.240
Look at your shirt!

618
00:33:17.334 --> 00:33:18.820
It's a complete mess!

619
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.237
- Come with me.
- Ow!


620
00:33:20.345 --> 00:33:21.640
What have you been doing?

621
00:33:21.767 --> 00:33:24.280
Running around in a
sausage factory?


622
00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:46.020
<i>The room was
completely empty.</i>


623
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.550
<i>A perfect place for me</i>

624
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.329
<i>and Daisy to do our training.</i>

625
00:33:49.607 --> 00:33:50.600
<i>And I figured,</i>

626
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.537
<i>if all the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children people showed up.</i>


627
00:33:54.863 --> 00:33:56.390
<i>They would probably look kindly</i>

628
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.200
<i>on a young mouse
trainer who was just</i>


629
00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.740
<i>going about his business.</i>

630
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.336
Jeez, that scared
the crap out of me.


631
00:34:41.588 --> 00:34:42.930
So, here we are.

632
00:34:43.997 --> 00:34:47.880
Here is the Le Grand
Imperial Ballroom


633
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.470
or Le Salon Grande, as we call it.

634
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.178
Well, actually we
call it the Mural Room


635
00:34:53.268 --> 00:34:54.510
because of all these
beautiful murals...


636
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.860
I was told there is only
one door in and out, yeah?


637
00:34:57.997 --> 00:34:58.990
Yeah. Yes.

638
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.847
There's, only that door there,

639
00:35:01.936 --> 00:35:03.940
in and out and which,
of course,


640
00:35:04.038 --> 00:35:06.280
does not make the
fire marshal very happy.


641
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.296
So, don't you go
starting any fires.


642
00:35:13.043 --> 00:35:14.600
This room will do.

643
00:35:16.072 --> 00:35:18.480
Right, so...

644
00:35:26.849 --> 00:35:29.020
Yeah, so, if there's any
is there anything else-that


645
00:35:29.101 --> 00:35:29.990
- you ladies...
- No.


646
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:30.929
- No?
- Bye-bye.


647
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.240
Oh, all right.

648
00:35:51.357 --> 00:35:55.120
Saoirse, secure the room!

649
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:06.490
Okay, you so-called ladies.

650
00:36:07.047 --> 00:36:09.280
Prepare for removal.

651
00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:28.291
Wake up.

652
00:37:06.764 --> 00:37:11.140
Okay, you trussed-up succubines.

653
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.571
You may remove your gloves.

654
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.480
You may remove your shoes.

655
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:48.712
And... you may
remove your wigs!


656
00:38:12.454 --> 00:38:14.360
They're all witches.

657
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.305
<i>My blood ran cold
as I started to get real scared.</i>


658
00:38:19.644 --> 00:38:22.670
<i>Here I was, trapped
in a room with a bunch</i>


659
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.882
<i>of bald-headed witches!</i>

660
00:38:26.214 --> 00:38:29.140
<i>And the mean one,
the bald-head honcho</i>


661
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.117
<i>who was standing right
above me.</i>


662
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.230
<i>The one who was
giving all the orders,</i>


663
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.440
<i>as soon as I got
a good look at her,</i>


664
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.370
<i>I knew instantly
who she had to be.</i>


665
00:38:40.148 --> 00:38:42.070
She's the Grand High Witch.

666
00:38:52.454 --> 00:38:54.950
Witches.

667
00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.960
Witches.

668
00:39:01.338 --> 00:39:08.820
You are a heap of
good-for-nothing worms!


669
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.423
This morning...

670
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.330
I'm having my breakfast

671
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.903
and I'm looking out
the window, at the beach


672
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.517
and what am I seeing? Hmm?

673
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.776
What am I seeing?

674
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.275
I'm seeing dozens,
I'm seeing hundreds,


675
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.943
I'm seeing hundreds...

676
00:39:35.094 --> 00:39:37.120
of repulsive little brats

677
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.969
playing in the sand
and it's putting me


678
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.887
right off my food!

679
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.110
So...

680
00:39:53.216 --> 00:39:57.389
Here are my orders.

681
00:39:59.517 --> 00:40:04.320
I want every
child in the world...


682
00:40:05.818 --> 00:40:08.910
rubbed out!

683
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.678
Squashed, squirted
and frittered!


684
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.364
Your Excellency,

685
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.170
do you have a plan?

686
00:40:18.595 --> 00:40:22.240
How can we possibly
wipe out every child?


687
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.327
That was actually a good question.

688
00:40:36.472 --> 00:40:40.660
Insubordinate but
a good question.


689
00:40:42.868 --> 00:40:44.905
Of course I have a plan.

690
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.228
I want each of you to return

691
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.660
to your pathetic little town.

692
00:40:50.835 --> 00:40:53.620
And open...

693
00:40:53.898 --> 00:40:56.700
a candy store.

694
00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.750
And in this store you will sell

695
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.499
only the highest
quality tastiest candy.


696
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.414
Now, you're probably wondering...

697
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.764
"Where do I get the money
to buy a candy shop?"


698
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:17.155
Well, I have
thought of that too.


699
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:22.660
In my room,
room number 666.


700
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.383
I have a steamer trunk

701
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.903
filled with brand-new,
crisp $100 bills!


702
00:41:28.124 --> 00:41:29.870
Room 666.

703
00:41:30.003 --> 00:41:34.940
Remember that
room number 666


704
00:41:35.065 --> 00:41:36.760
and your shops will sell

705
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.778
only the highest
quality tastiest candy.


706
00:41:44.684 --> 00:41:46.410
And...

707
00:41:48.256 --> 00:41:51.400
We use Formula Number 86

708
00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.527
Delayed Action Mouse Maker!

709
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:56.755
Ooh!

710
00:41:57.042 --> 00:42:01.020
One drop of Mouse
Maker in a piece of candy


711
00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.658
will transform
a dirty little child


712
00:42:03.743 --> 00:42:07.070
into a mouse in one hour!

713
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.812
Ah!

714
00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:12.063
Two drops will
transform the disgusting


715
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.652
little brat in 30 minutes.

716
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.343
And three drops
is instantaneous.


717
00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:21.320
An instant mouse!

718
00:42:24.298 --> 00:42:25.910
Oh.

719
00:42:27.635 --> 00:42:29.070
Oh, no, no, no.

720
00:42:36.524 --> 00:42:37.529
Shut up.

721
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:44.970
So, less than an hour ago,

722
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.357
I found a repulsive smelly

723
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.082
little boy in the
lobby and I gave him


724
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.016
an outrageously expensive

725
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.712
bar of Swiss chocolate.

726
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.578
A chocolate bar

727
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.204
that was laced with one drop

728
00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:59.691
- of my Number 86...
- Oh, no.


729
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.130
...Delayed Action
Mouse Maker potion!


730
00:43:01.162 --> 00:43:02.245
Bruno.

731
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.425
And I told
the greedy little brat


732
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.592
to meet me here at 12:25.

733
00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:10.680
So, in less than 10 minutes.

734
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.981
All you pathetic witches will

735
00:43:13.103 --> 00:43:16.530
see what a
true genius I am!


736
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.110
Genius! Genius! Genius!

737
00:43:31.644 --> 00:43:33.320
Quiet!

738
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.254
Where's my chocolate?

739
00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.065
It's the greedy little cretin.

740
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.063
- Hey, are you in there?
- Quick! Put on your wigs!


741
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.402
Welcome, you...

742
00:44:24.632 --> 00:44:27.990
fine, handsome man.

743
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.905
We've been waiting.

744
00:44:31.409 --> 00:44:33.409
Darling boy.

745
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:36.482
I have your chocolate for you.

746
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.792
You promised me
six bars of chocolate.


747
00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.877
I only see one in your hand.

748
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.240
You see, ladies.

749
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.730
Not only is he fat
and stupid


750
00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.573
but greedy too.

751
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.418
That's right, little man.

752
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.155
Here is your
delicious chocolate.


753
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.416
Come and get it.

754
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.336
Come and get it.

755
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:31.940
Get ready, girls.

756
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.494
Ten seconds.

757
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.746
Give me my chocolate.

758
00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:36.882
Give it to me.

759
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.520
It's right here, my darling.

760
00:45:39.762 --> 00:45:41.390
Daisy, what do we do?

761
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.060
Give me. Give me!

762
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.240
Five seconds.

763
00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:45.583
Give me my chocolate.

764
00:45:45.672 --> 00:45:47.160
Give it to me.

765
00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.680
- Three... Two...
- Give me it. Give me. Give me!


766
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:52.140
One...

767
00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:58.171
Ignition!

768
00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.090
That smelly brat.

769
00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:28.914
That horrid louse
has been transformed...


770
00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.393
She's done it.

771
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.087
She's a genius.

772
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.562
...into a lovely little mouse!

773
00:46:46.647 --> 00:46:48.780
What's the big idea?

774
00:46:49.051 --> 00:46:50.660
Where's my chocolate?

775
00:46:50.835 --> 00:46:52.280
Squish him!

776
00:46:52.407 --> 00:46:53.950
Whoa!

777
00:46:55.555 --> 00:46:56.870
Squish him! Kill him!

778
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.672
He's right there.

779
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.250
They turned Bruno into a mouse
and now they're trying to squish him.


780
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.200
I'll fetch him.

781
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.480
Did you just talk?

782
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:17.900
It's a swarm!

783
00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.185
They're everywhere!

784
00:47:21.287 --> 00:47:22.740
Get him.

785
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.690
Where is he? Where is he?

786
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.810
Gosh! You're a giant.

787
00:47:33.894 --> 00:47:35.060
Why are you so big?

788
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.260
I'm not big.
You're little. I'm normal.


789
00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.971
How can I be little?

790
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.350
Because you're a mouse.

791
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.700
A witch put a spell on you.

792
00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:43.654
Witch? What witch?

793
00:47:43.787 --> 00:47:46.329
Ah-ha! I knew it!

794
00:47:46.618 --> 00:47:48.530
Dog dropping!

795
00:47:50.505 --> 00:47:51.818
- Help!
- Grab him.


796
00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.573
- Help! Help me!
- Hold him down.


797
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.451
- Flip him. Gag position.
- Help!


798
00:47:56.698 --> 00:47:57.698
Help!

799
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.049
Open his trap.

800
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.709
Open it.

801
00:48:03.954 --> 00:48:05.537
Okay.

802
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:09.828
That's how you
wanna play, we'll play


803
00:48:09.941 --> 00:48:12.700
the Shakespeare way.

804
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.263
One drop...

805
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:22.684
Two...

806
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.650
Blast off.

807
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:35.070
Yes! Yes!

808
00:48:35.219 --> 00:48:36.304
Yes!

809
00:49:10.336 --> 00:49:15.404
Aren't you a cute little mouse?

810
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.112
Who has the mallet?

811
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.094
- Here! Here!
- Get the mallet.


812
00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.425
Where's the mallet?

813
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.770
I'm not afraid of nothing.

814
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:27.790
I have him.
Where's the mallet?


815
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:30.665
Come on. Give it to me.

816
00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:31.810
Give it to me!

817
00:49:38.854 --> 00:49:39.820
Run, Bruno, run!

818
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.320
So, you're a mouse too?

819
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.828
Now I've got you.

820
00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.900
Four legs, Bruno.

821
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.111
Four legs.

822
00:49:59.856 --> 00:50:01.230
Rats! A dead end!

823
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.122
Run, Bruno, run!

824
00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.820
No!

825
00:50:23.197 --> 00:50:24.844
Ow, my back.

826
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:30.280
What happened to us?

827
00:50:30.463 --> 00:50:32.180
Why are we mouses?

828
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.035
- "Mice."
- Whatever.


829
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.340
There's a convention of
witches here in the hotel


830
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:37.780
and they have an evil potion.

831
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.190
They put it in your chocolate.

832
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:41.192
My chocolate? Crikey!

833
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.004
They always spike the chocolate.

834
00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.527
It's standard evil
witch procedure.


835
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.724
Wait. You were a kid too?

836
00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.820
A girl.

837
00:50:48.967 --> 00:50:51.160
Do I look like a
baby goat to you?


838
00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:54.410
Nope, a mouse.

839
00:50:54.632 --> 00:50:56.530
What are we going to do?

840
00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.510
I don't want to be a mouse.

841
00:50:58.703 --> 00:51:00.530
I like being a
portly little kid.


842
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:01.746
"Child."

843
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:02.912
Whatever.

844
00:51:02.996 --> 00:51:04.940
All right, we have
to find my grandma.


845
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:06.480
She knows everything
about witches.


846
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.590
She'll know what to do.

847
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:08.871
Come on.

848
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.769
Two crab salads.

849
00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:16.190
What are you doing?

850
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.581
Wow, look at
all that lovely food.


851
00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.378
Okay, here's what we do.

852
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.820
You see that vent?

853
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.242
I bet that'll get us
to the lobby. Let's go.


854
00:51:24.369 --> 00:51:26.630
Pick that up.
That's white truffle.


855
00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:29.130
You have any idea
how much white truffle costs?


856
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:31.376
Wipe it off and
put it in the sauce.


857
00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.901
What is this?

858
00:51:33.051 --> 00:51:34.200
You call that puffed?

859
00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.403
Let's get some
more hands in here.


860
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.230
So, now what?

861
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.730
Look, all we need to do is
make our way to the elevator


862
00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:51.060
then up to the fourth floor.

863
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:52.300
Come on.

864
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.894
Hey, a little help.

865
00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.211
- Crikey.
- Hurry up.


866
00:51:59.357 --> 00:52:00.620
This way.

867
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:20.020
I just realized
something, y'all.


868
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:21.970
How exactly do
we reach the button


869
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:23.677
for the fourth floor?

870
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.522
Floor?

871
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.990
Four, please.

872
00:52:28.567 --> 00:52:29.870
Come on.

873
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.901
There's my room, 766.

874
00:52:47.013 --> 00:52:48.240
This way.

875
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:01.616
She's never
going to hear us.


876
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.800
A doorbell.

877
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:06.140
Come on.

878
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.757
Crikey!

879
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.733
All right.
We make a human ladder.


880
00:53:40.863 --> 00:53:42.150
You mean a mouse ladder?

881
00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.780
Right, a mouse ladder.

882
00:53:49.903 --> 00:53:51.410
Ow! Ow.

883
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.120
I got... I got...

884
00:53:58.392 --> 00:53:59.616
I got it!

885
00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:03.070
Help me!

886
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:05.925
Ahhh, great balls of fire,
don't let me fall!


887
00:54:12.595 --> 00:54:14.370
Follow me, boys.

888
00:54:33.376 --> 00:54:34.370
Mice!

889
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:36.840
Mice! Mice!

890
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:38.609
They everywhere!

891
00:54:53.512 --> 00:54:54.512
Grandma, it's me.

892
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.100
Grandma, it's me,
your grandson.


893
00:54:57.512 --> 00:55:00.490
My grandson... is that you, boy?

894
00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:02.356
Yes, Grandma, it's me.

895
00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:07.740
Is it really you?

896
00:55:07.865 --> 00:55:09.280
It's really me.

897
00:55:09.555 --> 00:55:11.748
- What happened?
- It was the Grand High Witch.


898
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:12.769
The Grand High Witch?

899
00:55:12.816 --> 00:55:14.630
Oh, Lord, not the
Grand High Witch.


900
00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.450
Yes. She mouse-afied me.

901
00:55:16.562 --> 00:55:18.150
And the whole hotel
is full of witches.


902
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.410
They're having a witch
convention or something.


903
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.769
You been through so much,
you don't need this.


904
00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.910
Grandma's so, so sorry.

905
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:26.490
Grandma, please get off the floor

906
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.148
and put me on
the coffee table.


907
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:29.790
How do I do that?

908
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:30.760
Pick me up.

909
00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:31.750
Pick you up?

910
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.220
Yeah, just like I pick up Daisy.

911
00:55:34.943 --> 00:55:36.070
Right.

912
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.450
I can't believe this
happened to you.


913
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:44.540
Believe me, things
could be a lot worse.


914
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:45.780
They could?

915
00:55:46.444 --> 00:55:48.240
Oh! Grandma, by the way,

916
00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.091
this is my friend,
Bruno Jenkins.


917
00:55:51.989 --> 00:55:53.680
He's now a mouse too,
but he used to be


918
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:55.545
a chubby, little English kid.

919
00:55:55.672 --> 00:55:57.230
You could've just
stopped at,


920
00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.892
"This is my friend, Bruno."

921
00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.430
I'm so sorry, Bruno.

922
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:02.976
Those nasty, evil witches
got you too, huh?


923
00:56:03.108 --> 00:56:05.450
Yes. They got me
good and proper.


924
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:07.169
It's been an awful day.

925
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.400
Anybody else hungry?

926
00:56:08.496 --> 00:56:09.450
Ahem!

927
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:12.280
Oh, and Daisy used to be
a kid... A girl too.


928
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.100
Why didn't you say
something before, darling?


929
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.870
Because it can be
very dangerous


930
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:17.306
for a mouse to talk.

931
00:56:17.517 --> 00:56:19.030
Most people
don't understand


932
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.567
and they get scared.

933
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:22.590
I almost said
something the other night


934
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.300
when you told the
story about Alice Blue


935
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:26.214
getting turned into a chicken,

936
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:27.790
but I thought better of it.

937
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:31.249
So, some wicked evil witch
mouse-afied you.


938
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.100
Yes, ma'am,
four months ago.


939
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:34.900
On the very same afternoon,

940
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:36.830
I ran away from
the orphanage.


941
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.120
Well, what happened
was, a kind lady...


942
00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:40.920
Well, I thought she was kind.

943
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.287
Anyway, she offered me
a chocolate bar


944
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:44.778
and before I knew it, poof!

945
00:56:44.915 --> 00:56:46.620
I was transformed.

946
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:50.070
Then, faster than a hot knife
cuts through butter.


947
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.865
A panhandler scoops me up

948
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:54.858
and sells me to a pet store
so he could buy food.


949
00:56:55.117 --> 00:56:56.160
Yum!

950
00:56:56.849 --> 00:56:58.290
I'm so sorry, Daisy.

951
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:59.930
Mary.

952
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:01.520
My real name is Mary.

953
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:03.000
Mary.
That's a pretty name.


954
00:57:03.155 --> 00:57:04.155
Excuse me.

955
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:07.080
All this talk about food
is making me really hungry.


956
00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:08.820
Can I have one
of those grapes?


957
00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.662
So, it was
the Grand High Witch


958
00:57:13.746 --> 00:57:15.590
and she's in this very hotel?

959
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.820
We got to do something to
turn you back. Make this right.


960
00:57:18.952 --> 00:57:21.090
The Grand High Witch
has a room full of potion.


961
00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.260
And she's gonna use it

962
00:57:22.329 --> 00:57:24.510
to turn every kid in
the world into a mouse.


963
00:57:24.717 --> 00:57:26.070
We have to help them.

964
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.800
- Who is it?
- Hotel maintenance.


965
00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:31.362
Quick, hide.

966
00:57:33.348 --> 00:57:36.440
Here. Hop in my knitting tote.

967
00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.620
Keep your heads down.

968
00:57:46.287 --> 00:57:47.280
Yes.

969
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:48.660
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am,

970
00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.122
but we got a report of
a possible rodent infestation.


971
00:57:51.202 --> 00:57:52.240
Rodent infestation?

972
00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.771
In a hotel this expensive?

973
00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.870
That's crazier than a
hog on slaughter day.


974
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.840
Yes, ma'am.
It's probably nothing.


975
00:57:58.073 --> 00:57:59.490
The maid who said
she saw the rodents


976
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.701
has a tendency to be
a bit high-strung.


977
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:02.505
Mmm.

978
00:58:02.552 --> 00:58:03.600
But, to be on the safe side.

979
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:05.650
I thought I'd lay these here
traps, if you don't mind.


980
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:06.370
Okay.

981
00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.240
- We put them in all the rooms.
- Mmm-hmm.


982
00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:09.660
Just to be safe.

983
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.997
So, what are they? Mice?

984
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.340
Oh. No, ma'am.

985
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.320
Maid said she saw
a swarm of huge, ugly rats.


986
00:58:18.567 --> 00:58:20.160
At least a dozen of them.

987
00:58:20.364 --> 00:58:21.870
Goodness, a dozen?

988
00:58:22.167 --> 00:58:23.360
Well, it's like I said...

989
00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:26.560
she has a tendency to be
a bit high-strung.


990
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.101
Fresh Wisconsin cheddar.

991
00:58:33.216 --> 00:58:34.915
Drives them rodents plumb crazy.

992
00:58:35.537 --> 00:58:36.870
They can't resist it.

993
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.420
Mmm...

994
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:46.449
Anyway, you hear any
of these traps start snapping...


995
00:58:46.595 --> 00:58:47.530
Give me a call.

996
00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:48.938
I sure will.

997
00:58:49.041 --> 00:58:50.340
That's right.

998
00:58:50.454 --> 00:58:51.960
Don't you know anything?

999
00:58:52.072 --> 00:58:53.420
Grapes can hurt a mouse.

1000
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:54.570
All right, you three.

1001
00:58:54.665 --> 00:58:56.720
You stay away from
those traps, you hear?


1002
00:58:56.934 --> 00:58:59.180
If we could just get our hands
on some of that potion.


1003
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:01.530
I might be able
to reverse-engineer it.


1004
00:59:01.832 --> 00:59:04.400
Make it a potion
that turns mice into children.


1005
00:59:04.642 --> 00:59:05.760
I always travel with

1006
00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:07.635
my anti-hex herbs and salts.

1007
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:10.256
But whoever knows where
that wicked evil witch is.


1008
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.745
We do. She's in room 666.

1009
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.630
We heard her tell
all those witches


1010
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:18.077
to meet her in room

1011
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:19.818
And we're in room 766.

1012
00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:21.690
Room 666 is right below us.

1013
00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:22.930
Good Lord!

1014
00:59:23.051 --> 00:59:25.230
That evil sorceress is living
right beneath us?


1015
00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.075
Yes. And here's what we do.

1016
00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.260
We wait for the Grand High Witch
to leave her room,


1017
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:30.900
then we use Grandma's knitting wool

1018
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.750
as a rope to lower me down
to the Grand High Witch's balcony.


1019
00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.300
I grab a bottle of potion,

1020
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:36.585
Grandma hoists me back up,

1021
00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.070
she reverses the spell
and ta-da!


1022
00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.738
We're kids again.

1023
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.929
Young man, you think
all that up just now?


1024
00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:45.868
Popped right into my head.

1025
00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.423
Vile, filthy brats.

1026
00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.203
You make me puke!

1027
01:00:03.203 --> 01:00:07.080
Hades, it's getting so bad.

1028
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.312
I can't even enjoy
a glass of wormwood.


1029
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.047
She's the Grand High Witch, right?

1030
01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.637
Grandma, that's the potion.

1031
01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.271
She's keeping it on ice.

1032
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.900
Yeah, it's exactly
what we need.


1033
01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.324
Hades, come.

1034
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.800
We are late for tea.

1035
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:46.647
Teatime. Perfect.

1036
01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:54.030
Now look, all we need is
one bottle of potion.


1037
01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.614
So, grab one as fast
as you can and hurry on back.


1038
01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.376
No telling when that monster
is fixing to return.


1039
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.800
I know you're
likely scared, baby.


1040
01:01:03.922 --> 01:01:05.070
I'm not scared, Grandma.

1041
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.223
I don't know why,

1042
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:08.670
but ever since I was turned
into a small mouse,


1043
01:01:08.821 --> 01:01:10.680
little things
don't scare me anymore.


1044
01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.075
Okay. Hold on tight.

1045
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.042
I can't believe
they won't let my precious


1046
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.570
into the dining room.

1047
01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:37.510
This fleabag, roach-trap hotel

1048
01:02:37.616 --> 01:02:40.280
discriminates
against everything.


1049
01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.882
Money.

1050
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.458
Money, money, money.

1051
01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:48.769
Oh, Hades.

1052
01:02:49.442 --> 01:02:52.340
Why in this
disgusting human world,


1053
01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:55.164
do you need money
for everything?


1054
01:03:08.038 --> 01:03:12.537
Disgusting, filthy lucre.

1055
01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:47.700
He's ready.

1056
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:05.084
Well, well, well, well.

1057
01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:08.548
Why is this wool here, I wonder?

1058
01:04:11.211 --> 01:04:13.200
Oh. Hello.

1059
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:15.720
I just dropped my knitting
over the balcony.


1060
01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:16.830
But it's all right.

1061
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.545
Thank goodness I still have
a hold of it on this end.


1062
01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:21.724
Well, I'm just gonna
go ahead on and...


1063
01:04:21.842 --> 01:04:23.200
And pull it on up.

1064
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:25.280
I'll be out of your way.

1065
01:04:25.508 --> 01:04:26.608
Let go.

1066
01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.673
I know you.

1067
01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:31.050
Me?

1068
01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.780
I don't think so.

1069
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.557
I have seen you before.

1070
01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.120
I remember your face.

1071
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:39.098
You might a seen me in
the lobby, maybe.


1072
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.957
No, no, no, no, no.

1073
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:42.774
Not in the lobby.

1074
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:45.960
I remember you from...

1075
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.077
What? Who is it?

1076
01:04:48.162 --> 01:04:50.740
It's Mr. Stringer III,
Hotel Manager.


1077
01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:52.466
Curses!

1078
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.950
You want me to remove
the children from the beach?


1079
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.802
I want them removed.

1080
01:05:04.896 --> 01:05:07.190
Well, I'll...
I'll see what I can do.


1081
01:05:07.395 --> 01:05:10.280
Madam, I procured this
for you today.


1082
01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:11.540
I thought you might like it.

1083
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.170
It's a kitty carrier.

1084
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:16.400
And I thought you
could put your feline


1085
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:18.360
friend in there and you
can transport him


1086
01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:22.002
all over the hotel,
including the dining room.


1087
01:05:23.277 --> 01:05:24.870
Thought you might like that.

1088
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:31.369
Well, let me
tell you something,


1089
01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:34.329
Mister Cat
-Cage
-Procurer.

1090
01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:40.440
I will never, ever allow
my precious puss to be...


1091
01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.880
Well, look at that.

1092
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:47.329
He likes it in there.

1093
01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:51.430
Oh, madam, I almost forgot.

1094
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.670
Regarding your ladies'
dinner this evening.


1095
01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:57.301
We have neglected
to select a soup.


1096
01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.970
Now, there are two choices.

1097
01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:01.650
One is our Cajun
spice crab Creole


1098
01:06:01.804 --> 01:06:04.890
and the other one is our
plantation kitchen split pea.


1099
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.040
Which one is cheaper?

1100
01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.300
Well, madam.
I'm sure you will appreciate


1101
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.560
that the crab is fresh and it is...

1102
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:16.700
Which one?

1103
01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:20.981
Plantation kitchen split pea.

1104
01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.232
That's the one.

1105
01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.700
Then we will have
the split pea soup.


1106
01:06:25.790 --> 01:06:26.990
Yes, madam.

1107
01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:29.070
And...

1108
01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.049
no garlic in the soup.

1109
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.560
No what?

1110
01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.658
Garlic.

1111
01:06:40.938 --> 01:06:42.501
No garlic?

1112
01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.660
Did I stutter?

1113
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.540
No garlic.

1114
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:52.530
My women, all
suffer from a selective


1115
01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.230
food avoidance disorder.

1116
01:06:55.456 --> 01:06:56.611
Picky eaters.

1117
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:59.430
Yes, madam.

1118
01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:00.755
As you wish.

1119
01:07:01.127 --> 01:07:02.980
I will inform the chef.

1120
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.015
You do that.

1121
01:07:06.854 --> 01:07:08.270
I'll let myself out.

1122
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:10.242
You do that.

1123
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:24.740
Well, my precious since you
enjoy being in that cage so much.


1124
01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.780
You can stay in it!

1125
01:07:26.892 --> 01:07:28.690
Traitor!

1126
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:35.964
<i>Mouse Maker potion.</i>

1127
01:07:40.778 --> 01:07:42.365
A drop of hyssop...

1128
01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.889
A smidgen of mugwort...

1129
01:07:53.889 --> 01:07:55.980
And now,
a dash of healing water


1130
01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:57.350
straight from Lourdes.

1131
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:59.945
This is the most powerful
healing water there is.


1132
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.451
Okay.

1133
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:09.450
Now let's all join hands
and bow our heads.


1134
01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:41.814
Well, I'll be...

1135
01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.992
Not much more
to say than that.


1136
01:08:47.748 --> 01:08:49.980
We had to try
something, kids.


1137
01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:54.860
This witch's
power is far greater


1138
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.740
than my little home remedies.

1139
01:08:57.291 --> 01:08:58.967
Evil power.

1140
01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.680
And strong.

1141
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:03.400
Much stronger than me.

1142
01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:06.230
Please don't cry, Grandma.

1143
01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:07.600
It'll be okay.

1144
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:09.370
I'm sorry, children.

1145
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:10.910
It's not your fault, Grandma.

1146
01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.650
Sometimes things just happen.

1147
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:15.390
Yeah, they do.

1148
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.609
I actually don't
mind being a mouse.


1149
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:24.560
I get to hang out
with my new friends all day.


1150
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:26.200
Don't have to go to
school anymore


1151
01:09:26.303 --> 01:09:27.790
and I don't have
to learn how to drive,


1152
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:30.130
which means I'll never
get into an accident.


1153
01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.602
Oh, child.

1154
01:09:31.818 --> 01:09:33.272
Come here.

1155
01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:36.080
Grandma, will you
still take care of me?


1156
01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.470
Even if I stay a mouse?

1157
01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:39.450
Of course I will, darling.

1158
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:40.942
Doesn't matter who you are

1159
01:09:41.112 --> 01:09:42.210
or what you look like,

1160
01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.157
so long as
somebody loves you.


1161
01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:46.100
And I always will.

1162
01:09:50.901 --> 01:09:52.370
What about my friends?

1163
01:09:52.835 --> 01:09:54.491
Can they stay too?

1164
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.468
Well, of course.

1165
01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.929
If they want to,
but don't forget


1166
01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:01.051
they all have loved
ones who miss them.


1167
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.590
I'm not so sure
about that.


1168
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:03.820
Don't be a fool.

1169
01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.032
I'm sure they love you.

1170
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.370
My mother thinks I'm clumsy

1171
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.115
and my father complains
that I'm always hungry.


1172
01:10:10.265 --> 01:10:11.990
Well, maybe this will
help them love you


1173
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:13.870
for who you are,
not for who you ain't.


1174
01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.995
You're fortunate to
have parents, Bruno.


1175
01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.164
Some of us don't.

1176
01:10:19.743 --> 01:10:21.370
But we're gonna be okay.

1177
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:22.694
We have Grandma.

1178
01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.510
And she'll always be our family.

1179
01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:27.051
And for that we
are very blessed.


1180
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:29.350
But what I wanna know

1181
01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.210
is why are we standing
around here lollygagging?


1182
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.440
How are we gonna stop those
horrible witches from turning


1183
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.381
more children into mice?

1184
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:38.780
She's right.

1185
01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.773
We got to do something.

1186
01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.629
I know what we'll do.

1187
01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.110
I sneak into the kitchen with
the Number 86 Mouse Maker,


1188
01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.540
then I slip the potion
into the witches' pea soup


1189
01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:49.928
and turn them all into mice.

1190
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:51.830
Are you sure about
this, little man?


1191
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.130
This sounds like it could
be a very dangerous


1192
01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:55.360
and scary mission.

1193
01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.600
Trust me, Grandma.
I can handle it.


1194
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:10.310
I'll meet you in the lobby bar.

1195
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:12.120
Bruno and Daisy
know which vent.


1196
01:11:12.308 --> 01:11:13.570
Be careful, darling.

1197
01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:14.990
I will, Grandma.

1198
01:11:38.468 --> 01:11:40.160
Hurry up there!

1199
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.370
The pea soup is ready.

1200
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:43.650
No garlic.

1201
01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:46.435
I got the soup, no garlic.
Chef, coming right up.


1202
01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:49.410
Where are my prawns?

1203
01:11:49.578 --> 01:11:51.470
This is not a prawn,
this is a shrimp.


1204
01:11:51.668 --> 01:11:54.030
You don't know the difference
between a shrimp and a prawn?


1205
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.320
Count the pincers.

1206
01:11:55.465 --> 01:11:58.320
One, two.

1207
01:11:58.722 --> 01:12:00.870
Let's start ladling
out that soup.


1208
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.300
Come on, you people.

1209
01:12:02.505 --> 01:12:04.330
Yes, Chef.

1210
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.341
What are you doing, huh?

1211
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:11.590
I'm getting
the prawns ready.


1212
01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:12.783
Don't tell me that's a prawn.

1213
01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:14.209
- I'm a crustacean expert.
- This is a prawn.


1214
01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.894
I've been sauteing prawns
for 30 years


1215
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:17.060
and I only use butter.

1216
01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:18.905
- Only butter?
- Never oil.


1217
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:21.428
I don't give a damn
about what nutritionists say.


1218
01:12:21.555 --> 01:12:23.820
They are the
ruination of cuisine.


1219
01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:26.458
Always butter, butter only.

1220
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:35.992
Where are my prawns?

1221
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:37.860
Who do I have to get

1222
01:12:37.974 --> 01:12:39.490
some prawns around here?

1223
01:12:42.265 --> 01:12:44.496
Let's start
ladling out that soup.


1224
01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:47.191
Yes, Chef.

1225
01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:48.360
Are you crying?

1226
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:49.800
There's no crying in my kitchen.

1227
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:54.730
Chef, this soup
needs some garlic.


1228
01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.110
Absolutely no garlic.

1229
01:12:56.204 --> 01:12:57.450
Stringer's orders.

1230
01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.038
Grease fire.

1231
01:12:59.192 --> 01:13:01.682
We got fire blankets
under those sinks.


1232
01:13:03.536 --> 01:13:05.510
Are those my prawns
that just exploded?


1233
01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:10.500
Forget the prawn, just throw
some shrimp in there.


1234
01:13:12.871 --> 01:13:15.370
You idiots don't know how...

1235
01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:21.974
Someone get me a sharp knife
so that I can kill myself.


1236
01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:29.705
Somebody call an exterminator.

1237
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:35.760
Look, there's
my mother and father.


1238
01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:42.741
That's your mother and father?

1239
01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:44.850
As I live and breathe.

1240
01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.570
Bruno, I think it's time
to say hello to your parents.


1241
01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.700
Are you mad?

1242
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:51.130
Right here in the bar?

1243
01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.329
There's no time like the present.

1244
01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:06.948
Excuse me, are you
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins?


1245
01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.140
Can we help you?

1246
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:10.930
I'm afraid I have some...

1247
01:14:11.065 --> 01:14:14.870
Well, strange news
about your son, Bruno.


1248
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.656
What about Bruno?

1249
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:18.040
Where is he?

1250
01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:21.350
Maybe we can go somewhere
a bit more private.


1251
01:14:21.781 --> 01:14:23.870
Private? Why do
we have to be private?


1252
01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:26.167
It's not an easy thing
for him to explain.


1253
01:14:26.311 --> 01:14:28.700
He'd be much more comfortable
we all went up to your room.


1254
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:32.087
No, no, look here, madam. I'm perfectly
comfortable exactly where I am.


1255
01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:34.138
So, either you tell me
where I can find Bruno


1256
01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.941
or you just
leave us alone now.


1257
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:37.830
Well...

1258
01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.727
got him right here.

1259
01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.350
That's a mouse!
A mouse!


1260
01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:45.360
What in God's name
is wrong with you?


1261
01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:47.230
Get that filthy
rodent out of here!


1262
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:48.490
No, no, no, no.
This is Bruno.


1263
01:14:48.583 --> 01:14:50.080
Bruno, say something to them.

1264
01:14:52.412 --> 01:14:53.510
"Say something"?

1265
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:54.858
Are you insane?

1266
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.268
Get away from us
before I call the manager.


1267
01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:59.630
Quit all this hollering.
This is your son, Bruno.


1268
01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.701
Manager! Someone
get me the manager.


1269
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.640
This woman has just scared
my wife half to death.


1270
01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.930
She's walking around
with rats in her handbag.


1271
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:09.691
Bruno, why didn't
you say something?


1272
01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:14.628
My father hates it when I talk
with my mouth full.


1273
01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.720
Psst! Grandma.

1274
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:17.870
Down here.

1275
01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:18.976
There you are.

1276
01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:20.550
Thank the Lord.

1277
01:15:20.938 --> 01:15:22.180
So, how'd it go?

1278
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.261
Soup is on.

1279
01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:33.654
Look! The pea soup.

1280
01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:39.450
Here we are, garlic free.

1281
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:43.908
Excuse me, madam,

1282
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:45.640
may I have a
word with you?


1283
01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.746
Please, this way.

1284
01:15:49.668 --> 01:15:51.084
Just over here.

1285
01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.160
Um... You wouldn't happen

1286
01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:57.210
to be carrying
around a mouse


1287
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:59.020
on your person now,
would you?


1288
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.661
- A mouse?
- Mmm-hmm.


1289
01:16:00.858 --> 01:16:02.770
Why on earth would I
be carrying around a mouse?


1290
01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.270
Does this have anything to do

1291
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.700
with all the rat traps being
set up all over this hotel?


1292
01:16:06.736 --> 01:16:07.480
Rat traps?

1293
01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:09.730
Is this your pathetic idea
of a smoke screen?


1294
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:11.810
Accusing your guests
of carrying around mice


1295
01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:14.294
to hide the fact that this
hotel has a mouse infestation.


1296
01:16:14.407 --> 01:16:16.050
Shh. No... Shh. What?

1297
01:16:16.218 --> 01:16:17.240
I'll tell you this.

1298
01:16:17.437 --> 01:16:19.030
For what this
hotel is costing me,


1299
01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.710
I better not see
a single mouse.


1300
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:22.677
Not even a tiny, cute one.

1301
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:25.140
Yes, madam. I'm so...

1302
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:26.764
My mistake. I'm sorry.

1303
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:28.157
Luther.

1304
01:16:28.943 --> 01:16:31.240
Would you please show
this lady to our finest table?


1305
01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.079
Certainly. This way.

1306
01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.470
- Apologies, madam, I, it's just...
- Mmm.


1307
01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:43.080
Our finest table, madam.

1308
01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:45.710
Oh! Thank you, Luther.

1309
01:16:45.809 --> 01:16:49.040
I'm sure your finest table
in this lovely establishment


1310
01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.348
is this one right here
next to the kitchen.


1311
01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.460
I always prefer a
table near the exit


1312
01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.098
so I can get out fast.

1313
01:16:57.974 --> 01:16:59.770
- Of course.
- Mmm.


1314
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:31.250
Check it out.

1315
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.780
They love the soup.

1316
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:34.710
Have you decided?

1317
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.148
Yes, I think I'll
have the jambalaya.


1318
01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.771
Excellent.
And would you like


1319
01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:41.216
something to start?

1320
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.079
Mmm...

1321
01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.910
Well, that pea soup those
fancy ladies are eating looks good.


1322
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I'll have that.

1323
01:17:48.082 --> 01:17:49.780
I'm sorry.
That soup is reserved


1324
01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:52.740
strictly for that group
of lady guests only.


1325
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:56.209
If I may, that
large party suffers


1326
01:17:56.312 --> 01:17:58.230
from a severe garlic allergy.

1327
01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.830
So, they have requested their
soup be prepared garlic free.


1328
01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.000
It is very bland.

1329
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:03.830
Practically inedible.

1330
01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.290
I see.

1331
01:18:07.555 --> 01:18:09.230
That sounds disgusting.

1332
01:18:10.628 --> 01:18:13.249
May I suggest
the Cajun spice crab Creole?


1333
01:18:13.475 --> 01:18:15.362
It's one of our
signature dishes.


1334
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:21.607
Sounds...

1335
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.385
Yes?

1336
01:18:23.795 --> 01:18:26.700
Uh, the... The shrimp
Creole will be fine.


1337
01:18:27.258 --> 01:18:28.870
You mean
the crab Creole?


1338
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:30.981
Yes, yes, the crab Creole.

1339
01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:32.510
Very good.

1340
01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:44.990
Keep your heads down,
we got company.


1341
01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:56.210
Pigtails.

1342
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.091
I'm sorry?

1343
01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.880
Pigtails.

1344
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:05.402
You wore pigtails.

1345
01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.804
Do I know you?

1346
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:13.442
Many years ago,
in a shabby little town.


1347
01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:17.395
A shabby little town
right here in Alabama.


1348
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:20.584
You wore pigtails.

1349
01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.590
And you got away from me.

1350
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:26.962
Remember?

1351
01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:33.583
But I got that
horrid little friend


1352
01:19:33.705 --> 01:19:34.780
of yours.

1353
01:19:36.543 --> 01:19:37.810
Remember...

1354
01:19:47.757 --> 01:19:49.280
Quick, mouse ladder.

1355
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:53.910
It was you.

1356
01:19:54.134 --> 01:19:56.160
You were the filthy
witch who turned Alice.


1357
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:03.120
That's a nasty...

1358
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:30.920
What are you doing?

1359
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:36.240
Grandma, look.

1360
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:40.601
Attaboy.

1361
01:21:01.539 --> 01:21:04.580
High five, baby!

1362
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.981
That's some serious ratification.

1363
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:20.160
Oh, my God.
It's on my leg!


1364
01:21:29.367 --> 01:21:32.950
Ooh. Lordy,
hell's a-poppin'.


1365
01:21:44.581 --> 01:21:48.680
Come here,
you nasty critter...


1366
01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.980
Get it off! Get it off!

1367
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.380
Get it off!

1368
01:22:07.897 --> 01:22:09.270
Come on, kids.

1369
01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:10.760
It's time to skedaddle.

1370
01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:21.700
Somebody call the exterminator!

1371
01:22:36.792 --> 01:22:38.230
Good job.

1372
01:22:46.284 --> 01:22:48.120
Ooh, ooh...

1373
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:52.010
Look at all this potion.

1374
01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.770
Kids, we got to
grab every bottle.


1375
01:22:56.934 --> 01:22:57.934
Hey, Grandma.

1376
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:59.010
What about him?

1377
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:05.795
I'll call the manager to let
him out once we out of here.


1378
01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.282
Oh, I dropped some.

1379
01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:12.548
I'll get it, Grandma.

1380
01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:24.040
Whoa, that cheese
smells awfully good.


1381
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.376
Look what you made me do.

1382
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:24.710
You think you're so clever,

1383
01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.940
breaking into my
room with a stolen key?


1384
01:24:28.138 --> 01:24:30.420
But everyone knows they keep

1385
01:24:30.552 --> 01:24:33.240
a spare key
at the front desk.


1386
01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:36.778
We'll never let you get away
with your filthy, evil plot.


1387
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:37.809
Oh, no?

1388
01:24:37.851 --> 01:24:39.320
Who's gonna stop me?

1389
01:24:39.475 --> 01:24:42.130
A feeble, stupid,

1390
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:45.846
sick woman like you?

1391
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:49.850
Oh, you think that's funny?

1392
01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.541
Not that.

1393
01:24:51.746 --> 01:24:53.704
See, I was just thinking.

1394
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:57.107
Pretty soon, you not gonna
be able to do much of nothing.


1395
01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:00.430
And why is that
brave little,


1396
01:25:00.538 --> 01:25:02.570
soon-to-be-dead woman?

1397
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.289
The pea soup.

1398
01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:13.940
The pea soup...
No... No...


1399
01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:16.585
No...

1400
01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:26.324
You stupid fool.

1401
01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.541
I did not drink the pea soup.

1402
01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:35.750
If you recall, I
was interrupted.


1403
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.860
Okay, here's
what we're gonna do.


1404
01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.570
Well, well, well.

1405
01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:45.277
Let me see.

1406
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:51.880
I think I will reach
into your chest


1407
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.900
and rip out your
withered, shriveled heart


1408
01:25:57.050 --> 01:26:00.096
and squeeze it
until it bursts.


1409
01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:03.310
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1410
01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:06.385
All your butt-ugly witch-talk
don't scare me one bit.


1411
01:26:06.515 --> 01:26:09.040
It should, considering
the last thing,


1412
01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:12.453
you will ever see is
my snickering face.


1413
01:26:18.562 --> 01:26:21.640
I believe with every
fiber of my being...


1414
01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.360
...that in the end,
love will always triumph


1415
01:26:27.450 --> 01:26:30.010
over hatred and evil.

1416
01:26:30.159 --> 01:26:31.510
Is that so?

1417
01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:34.082
You may have turned Alice
and my grandson,


1418
01:26:34.204 --> 01:26:37.000
but I will make sure you
never turn another child.


1419
01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:38.610
So help me, God.

1420
01:26:38.704 --> 01:26:40.038
Now!

1421
01:27:51.490 --> 01:27:54.661
You stupid rat.

1422
01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:56.161
Look what you've done.

1423
01:27:57.098 --> 01:27:57.810
Run!

1424
01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.964
Look what you've done.

1425
01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:05.129
You stupid rodents.

1426
01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.820
Get back here!

1427
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:10.930
You filthy pests.

1428
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:12.380
- Yum.
- Parasites.


1429
01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.232
Kid, I'm gonna get you.

1430
01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.865
You putrid varmints.

1431
01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:23.626
Now I've got you!

1432
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.942
What?

1433
01:28:27.983 --> 01:28:29.990
I'm done listening
to your trash talk.


1434
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:32.162
What is this?

1435
01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.660
You fool.

1436
01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:40.171
Let me out.

1437
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:41.811
Let me out!

1438
01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.840
Let me out! Let me out!

1439
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.991
I will rip out your tongues.

1440
01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:56.920
Stupid mice.

1441
01:28:57.075 --> 01:28:59.020
♪ The witch in a bottle... ♪

1442
01:28:59.130 --> 01:29:00.370
- Let me out.
- ♪ Witch in a bottle... ♪


1443
01:29:00.450 --> 01:29:02.820
Let me out of this
stupid fish bowl.


1444
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:05.610
Hey, Grandma, this is
the key to that big trunk.


1445
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:07.370
That's my key.

1446
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.538
That's my key!

1447
01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.552
That's my key,
you pea-brain brat.


1448
01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.280
- You pea-brain parasites!
- Come on, guys.


1449
01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:16.580
Put your tongue
back in your mouth.


1450
01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:19.503
You filthy sewer guttersnipes!

1451
01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.712
What are you doing?

1452
01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.727
What are you doing?
That is mine.


1453
01:29:26.863 --> 01:29:27.863
That's mine.

1454
01:29:28.025 --> 01:29:30.620
You idiots.
You scoundrels.


1455
01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:32.007
That is a lot of bacon.

1456
01:29:32.082 --> 01:29:33.500
- Lettuce.
- Dough.


1457
01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.969
Hey, you're making me
terribly hungry.


1458
01:29:36.138 --> 01:29:38.200
No, get your hands off
of that, that's mine!


1459
01:29:38.630 --> 01:29:41.884
Get your filthy paws
off my filthy lucre.


1460
01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.640
I'll poke out your
beady eyes.


1461
01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:45.249
What are you looking at?

1462
01:29:46.388 --> 01:29:47.670
What's that, Grandma?

1463
01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.880
It's a list of names
and addresses


1464
01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:52.590
of every witch in the world.

1465
01:29:52.764 --> 01:29:53.600
Wow!

1466
01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:56.450
With that list and that money
and all this potion.


1467
01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.992
We could turn every witch
in the world into rats.


1468
01:29:59.447 --> 01:30:00.820
Excellent!

1469
01:30:01.282 --> 01:30:04.520
I'll cut off your tails
with rusty scissors.


1470
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:08.120
I'll clip your ears
with toenail clippers.


1471
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:10.849
I'll poke out your beady eyes.

1472
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.927
I'll get you for this!

1473
01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:17.075
All right,
kiddies, one hop.


1474
01:30:17.282 --> 01:30:18.520
We got work to do.

1475
01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.722
I almost forgot.

1476
01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.820
No, no, no, don't do that.

1477
01:30:31.136 --> 01:30:33.870
What are you doing?

1478
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:35.820
Hades.

1479
01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.837
Good pussy.

1480
01:30:38.491 --> 01:30:39.600
You are a good pussy cat.

1481
01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.978
Nice kitty.

1482
01:30:42.138 --> 01:30:44.030
- You two have fun now.
- Nice kitty.


1483
01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:48.145
You stupid,
mangy fleabag. Precious.


1484
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:50.210
Put the books back.

1485
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:54.210
Stay back, you
stupid, precious...


1486
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:55.960
No! Hades.

1487
01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:57.940
Hades, precious.

1488
01:30:58.110 --> 01:31:00.567
Remember,
who feeds you.


1489
01:31:00.730 --> 01:31:02.035
No, don't think about food.

1490
01:31:10.929 --> 01:31:12.580
Grandma, you hear that?

1491
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:15.635
I don't know what
you're talking about.


1492
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.905
I didn't hear a thing.

1493
01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.620
Oh! Well, thank you kindly.

1494
01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:23.660
And one for you.

1495
01:31:25.917 --> 01:31:26.950
<i>The next morning,</i>

1496
01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:29.216
<i>we were feeling
joyful and triumphant.</i>


1497
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:31.950
<i>As a matter of fact,
Grandma was so happy.</i>


1498
01:31:32.096 --> 01:31:33.530
<i>She was spreading her joy</i>

1499
01:31:33.668 --> 01:31:35.456
<i>to the entire hotel staff.</i>

1500
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.250
Thank you kindly
for everything.


1501
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.571
One for you.

1502
01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:41.065
And one for you.

1503
01:31:42.138 --> 01:31:43.326
Thank you, ma'am.

1504
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:50.150
<i>Bruno tried to explain
the situation to his mom.</i>


1505
01:31:50.251 --> 01:31:51.254
Hello, Mother.

1506
01:31:53.089 --> 01:31:54.740
I'm now a mouse.

1507
01:31:57.978 --> 01:31:59.130
- It's a mouse!
<i>- But it turned out</i>


1508
01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.800
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins</i>

1509
01:32:00.976 --> 01:32:02.640
<i>weren't really mouse people.</i>

1510
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:04.710
<i>So, we decided it
would be best</i>


1511
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:06.722
<i>if Bruno came to stay with me,</i>

1512
01:32:06.849 --> 01:32:08.246
<i>Grandma and Daisy.</i>

1513
01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:27.020
Faster, faster!

1514
01:32:37.530 --> 01:32:38.915
Here we go!

1515
01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.020
Whee!

1516
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.320
- Cool!
- Whoo-hoo!


1517
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:49.330
How's my hair look?

1518
01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:50.690
How's my hair?

1519
01:32:52.101 --> 01:32:54.030
Whoo-hoo!

1520
01:32:56.232 --> 01:32:57.320
Whoo-hoo!

1521
01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:59.260
Let's go again, y'all.

1522
01:32:59.370 --> 01:33:01.051
This time I sit in the front.

1523
01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.010
Grandma, I love being a mouse.

1524
01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:05.910
Oh, I believe you do.

1525
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:07.510
But you wanna know
something weird?


1526
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:09.360
I still feel just like a boy.

1527
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:10.820
But you are, darling.

1528
01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:12.620
Life changes all of us.

1529
01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:13.920
I mean, look at me.

1530
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:15.450
I'm getting on up in the years,

1531
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.818
but I still feel
like a girl.


1532
01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.044
And I still feel like a boy.

1533
01:33:20.289 --> 01:33:21.560
See?

1534
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:23.188
You get it.

1535
01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:25.750
Never give up
what you are inside.


1536
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:28.990
When I look at you,
I don't see


1537
01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.362
whiskers and a pink nose.

1538
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.192
I just see your eyes.

1539
01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:35.390
Bright and beautiful.

1540
01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:42.369
Grandma, how long
does a mouse live?


1541
01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:44.320
Oh, an ordinary mouse

1542
01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:46.380
only lives about
three years,


1543
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:48.571
but you're no ordinary mouse.

1544
01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:52.010
You're a mouse-person and
a mouse-person will almost certainly live


1545
01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:54.390
three times longer
than an ordinary mouse.


1546
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:55.767
Maybe even longer.

1547
01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.522
That's great news.

1548
01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:58.750
I couldn't stand being

1549
01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:00.790
looked after
by anybody else.


1550
01:34:01.050 --> 01:34:02.967
I'll be a very old
mouse and you'll be


1551
01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.340
a very old grandmother

1552
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:06.294
and we'll
both die together.


1553
01:34:07.649 --> 01:34:09.320
With a little luck, darling.

1554
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:11.540
But no one
knows how long


1555
01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.569
their time is on this earth.

1556
01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:16.210
Only God knows that answer.

1557
01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.884
And that is the natural
order of things.


1558
01:34:23.635 --> 01:34:27.000
<i>Daisy, Bruno and I
loved living with Grandma.</i>

Yes, sir. Number 86
Mouse Maker potion, sir.

a taste of their own medicine.
