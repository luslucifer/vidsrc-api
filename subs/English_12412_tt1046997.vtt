Where's Major Lance?</i>

<i>[man] Colonel! 
Am I glad to see you!</i>

11
00:01:51.187 --> 00:01:55.385
<i>[man 2] Those bodies...
Get those bodies down!</i>


12
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:59.122
<i>- What are you doing? Get 'em down!
- Of course. Yes, sir.</i>


13
00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:02.325
<i>- We've been under fire...
- I know you have, but I don't care!</i>


14
00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:07.064
<i>Get 'em down! Down!
Don't want those boys left up there.</i>

<i>We're gonna hold this town till
the linkup does come, whenever it is.</i>

<i>Today, tomorrow,
till hell freezes over.</i>


17

<i>For their sake,
if for no other reason.</i>

<i>- [man] Private?
- [man 2] Yes, sir.</i>


19
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:24.279
<i>- [man] It's a hell of a war.
- [man 2] A privilege to serve with you.</i>


20

<i>Well, God willing, we'll do
what we came here to do.</i>

<i>- Ready, sir.
- Move out!</i>


22
00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:40.025
Pilgrim, we fought
for this country, too.


23
00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:44.735
Five postcard stamps, please.

24
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.005
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

[speaks Jamaican]

29
00:03:07.864 --> 00:03:09.422
Twenty-cent stamp, please.

Excuse me, sir?
Twenty-cent stamp, please.

- Um, press.

OK.

36
00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:24.696
- Are you Detective Ricci?
- That's my story.


37
00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:25.969
I heard about you.

38
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.876
[grunts] Yeah, well,
you oughta change friends then.

<i>I'm Tim Boyle. 
Daily News.</i>

40

<i>- What happened?
- Read about it in the New York Post.</i>


41
00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:38.719
<i>They left here two hours ago along with
The Times, Newsday and every channel</i>


42
00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:42.714
you can get on TV with a wire hanger.
Ain't you ever heard of the early bird?


43
00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.626
- Christ.
- Go find a wailing wall.


44
00:04:45.662 --> 00:04:47.596
- I got lost.
- Comin' here?


45
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.689
Find another way
for a dollar to change pockets.


46
00:04:49.732 --> 00:04:53.133
- It's my first day as a reporter.
- It's probably your last.


47
00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.831
Welcome to New York.
Be like Governor Rockefeller:


48
00:04:55.872 --> 00:04:58.568
- Come and go at the same time.
- Give me some angle.


49
00:04:58.608 --> 00:05:01.668
All I can give you
is an empty feeling, kid.


50
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:04.839
The perp's over at Bellevue,
eighth floor peanut gallery.


51
00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:07.315
The victim's deader
than yesterday's beer.


52
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.944
Heard he wasn't special
when he was breathing.


53
00:05:09.986 --> 00:05:13.444
My next job's gonna be stuffin'
ballot boxes on Staten Island.


54
00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:18.085
Remind me to vote. I live there.
Most cops do. Go home, kid.


55
00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:19.992
- Don't stop for bread.
- Come on.


56
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.465
Gotta be something I can work.
Can I give you a tip on a hot horse?


57
00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.263
I'll play Santa at the PA
on Christmas Day. Or I'll...


58
00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:30.295
I'll pay Hong Kong Sue over on Forty
Deuce to blow your noodle like Satchmo.


59
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.467
How about I put a story
in your hip pocket?


60
00:05:32.508 --> 00:05:34.601
"Good Cop Helps Poor Kids."

61
00:05:34.644 --> 00:05:38.375
Honest to Jesus, you get three months
of Saturdays out of it. Come on.


62
00:05:38.414 --> 00:05:40.882
I can't go back to scratching out obits.

63
00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.944
See those guys?
Don't turn around.


64
00:05:44.988 --> 00:05:49.084
They're rolling up to Harlem
to sniff around the perp's apartment.


65
00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:53.061
Only case that dynamic duo has cracked
has Schaefer written on the side,


66
00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:56.759
but maybe you'll see something.
Don't quote those gumflappers.


67
00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:58.630
- You need a quote, you call me.
- OK.


68
00:05:58.668 --> 00:06:01.159
- Haggerty, Dillard!
- Yeah, what's up?


69
00:06:01.204 --> 00:06:05.231
- Take this guy uptown with you.
- Thank you. Thank you.


70
00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:07.800
- Come on.
- All right.


71
00:06:19.088 --> 00:06:22.148
We'll start in the living room
and work our way back.


72
00:06:24.327 --> 00:06:26.420
Close the door behind you, kid.

73
00:06:49.018 --> 00:06:51.350
This perp is very, very religious.

74
00:06:51.387 --> 00:06:54.823
Nothing wrong with being
in good standing with the Lord.


75
00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:02.287
And a war hero, too.
Look at this, a Purple Heart.


76
00:07:02.332 --> 00:07:05.392
Hey, Keith, the Brown Bomber.

77
00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:09.269
[Keith] Muhammad Ali would've knocked
him out. Way too fast for Joe Louis.


78
00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:11.205
He can run, but he can't hide.

79
00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:25.113
Hey, Dan, what the hell is this?

80
00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:28.715
- [Dan] What you got there?
- I don't know. It's heavy.


81
00:07:28.758 --> 00:07:32.717
Whatever this is, it ain't junior-grade.
This thing looks expensive.


82
00:07:32.762 --> 00:07:38.530
My wife claws around flea markets
looking for this crap every weekend.


83
00:07:38.568 --> 00:07:40.433
I'm telling you, this ain't normal.

84
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.165
This definitely ain't normal.

85
00:07:42.205 --> 00:07:45.072
- Back up, buddy.
- Sorry.


86
00:07:45.108 --> 00:07:46.632
[Keith] No problem.

87
00:07:46.676 --> 00:07:49.474
- Professor Brooks?
- Yes.


88
00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:56.482
I get a lot of these things.
Old rocks. Antique specials.


89
00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:59.420
It seems like every
schmuck in the world


90
00:07:59.455 --> 00:08:03.482
who finds a backyard arrowhead
mistakes me for Iris.


91
00:08:03.526 --> 00:08:04.959
Put it here.

92
00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:09.658
From Greek mythology.
She is the faithful voice of Zeus.


93
00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:14.363
She flies from place to place
and commands respect


94
00:08:14.404 --> 00:08:17.805
from mortals and from im...

95
00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:21.336
...immortals.

96
00:08:23.746 --> 00:08:26.874
- Where the hell'd you get this?
- From a perp's apartment.


97
00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:29.180
- It's got this mark...
- Don't touch it.


98
00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:34.918
This is over 450 years old.

99
00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:38.757
It's the missing Primavera
from the Santa Trinita.


100
00:08:38.795 --> 00:08:41.263
<i>Is that the Niña, the Pinta
or the Santa Maria?</i>


101
00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:43.356
Oh, for God sakes, detective.

102
00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:46.391
It's the oldest elliptic

103
00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:49.803
arch bridge in the world.

104
00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:53.366
It's in Florence, Italy.

105
00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:55.673
Built by Ammanati.

106
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:59.112
This was one of four statues on it.

107
00:08:59.148 --> 00:09:03.983
The Primavera, meaning "spring."

108
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.851
This head has been missing

109
00:09:05.888 --> 00:09:10.518
since the Nazis blew up
the bridge in 1944.


110
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.793
My God! This is a gold mine!

111
00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:18.590
A gold mine!

112
00:09:23.206 --> 00:09:24.730
Yo!

[children shouting]

[in Italian]
Darling, come back to bed.


119
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.890
Please. Enough.

120
00:10:58.935 --> 00:11:01.597
I need a little break, OK, baby?

121
00:11:07.109 --> 00:11:10.010
[Tim] They say you haven't
spoken or eaten in two days.


122
00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:13.072
They'll try to force-feed you.

123
00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:15.413
Make you rise, like Jesus.

124
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:24.860
Come on. I've hiked all over
New York asking about you.


125
00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:27.692
I talked to everybody.
Cops, your sister.


126
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.291
Spoke to your cousin in San Juan.
You're clean as a board of health.


127
00:11:31.334 --> 00:11:33.996
You got no kids, no debts, no enemies.

128
00:11:34.036 --> 00:11:36.163
Four years in the service. Purple Heart.

129
00:11:36.205 --> 00:11:38.571
Twenty-five years
of a great marriage,


130
00:11:38.608 --> 00:11:41.873
till your wife's heart gave out.

131
00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:47.472
So why you stick a German Luger
in a guy's chest


132
00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:51.850
three months short of your retirement?
Five million dollars.


133
00:11:51.887 --> 00:11:54.856
That's how much that head would
draw on the black market.


134
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.587
What's it doin' buried there
on the bottom of your closet?


135
00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:08.835
You're looking at 25 to life, pal.

136
00:12:08.871 --> 00:12:12.363
Unless you can afford a lawyer,
you're gonna swallow happy pills


137
00:12:12.408 --> 00:12:15.206
in this nuthouse the rest of your life.

138

But my story could help you.
And you need help, mac.

[woman, in Italian] Enrico, what kind
of art dealer specializes in Nazi art?


140
00:12:29.058 --> 00:12:31.891
Because it's a lucrative business.

141
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.099
[in Italian] You Americans love work
more than you love 'love.'

are you ignoring me?


144
00:12:44.507 --> 00:12:46.304
[Keith] Pina, no.
Don't come over here.


145
00:12:49.578 --> 00:12:52.012
[in Italian] Enrico, you said
you only needed ten minutes.


146
00:12:52.048 --> 00:12:54.915
I gotta catch up. World might've
ended, I wouldn't know


147
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.147
'cause we've been going at it
two days. For crying out loud.

[in Italian] The world is still here.

You and I are still here.

00:42:35.963 --> 00:42:39.160
This boy ain't done nothing to you.

459
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.997
Mm-hm.

460
00:42:41.035 --> 00:42:43.731
You didn't want him before, did you?

461
00:42:48.876 --> 00:42:52.437
- Where you goin', Sam Train?
- Hey, Stamps, we movin' or not?


462
00:42:57.151 --> 00:43:00.314
We hold here till night.
Me and Bishop'll take first watch.


463
00:43:00.354 --> 00:43:04.188
Hector, you and Train take second.
Give the boy whatever first aid you got.


464
00:43:13.868 --> 00:43:17.463
What'd you get us into now, Diesel?

465
00:43:17.505 --> 00:43:22.169
It's always something with you,
big fella. Here, you gonna need these.


466
00:43:22.209 --> 00:43:24.643
Come on, kid.
[speaks Italian] Eat.


467
00:43:24.678 --> 00:43:26.077
Eat.

468
00:43:27.081 --> 00:43:29.072
Come on.

469
00:43:29.116 --> 00:43:30.913
He won't take the medicine.

470
00:43:37.658 --> 00:43:39.717
Go on, give it here.

471
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.126
You want some chocolate, boy?

472
00:43:45.232 --> 00:43:48.167
I wouldn't get attached.
He'll be dead in a week.


473
00:43:48.202 --> 00:43:53.162
I ain't never been this close
to a white person before, Hec.


474
00:43:53.207 --> 00:43:56.438
Never even touched one.
Not even a dead one.


475
00:43:56.477 --> 00:43:59.844
If this one dies, I'll give you
a whistle as a consolation prize.


476
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.872
- You really think he'll die?
- Why worry about it?


477
00:44:02.917 --> 00:44:04.908
We could all be dead
in an hour anyway.


478
00:44:11.859 --> 00:44:13.884
Why you always kissing that thing, Hec?

479
00:44:13.928 --> 00:44:18.763
- Reminds me who my father is.
- I don't need help remembering my pa.


480
00:44:18.799 --> 00:44:22.428
His name's Chester.
Chester Train.


481
00:44:22.469 --> 00:44:24.300
Let's give this kid some water.

482
00:44:28.676 --> 00:44:29.700
[in Italian] Water.

483
00:44:33.847 --> 00:44:34.905
Arturo?

484
00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:38.181
Can I ask you something?

485
00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:39.617
What you want, boy?

486
00:44:39.653 --> 00:44:41.553
[in Italian] Can you
tell me who I am?

487
00:44:42.756 --> 00:44:45.691
Hector, you speak that Italian?
What's he saying?


488
00:44:45.726 --> 00:44:48.194
He said, "Who am I?"
But who's he talking to?


489
00:44:48.228 --> 00:44:50.253
Lord, I knew it!

490
00:44:50.297 --> 00:44:52.993
I could see it in his face!
Look at him, Hec.


491
00:44:53.033 --> 00:44:54.830
Shh! Quiet down.

492
00:44:54.868 --> 00:44:57.336
Good God!

493
00:44:57.371 --> 00:44:59.271
- He got the power!
- What power?


494
00:44:59.306 --> 00:45:03.333
God knows it. In the olden days,
everything could speak.


495
00:45:03.377 --> 00:45:05.777
- The trees, the birds.
- Shh!


496
00:45:05.813 --> 00:45:10.011
If you could hear them things,
then that mean you had it.


497
00:45:13.554 --> 00:45:18.218
This boy's standing
in the shadow of God, Hector.


498
00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:22.388
Thank you, Jesus! Thank you for standing
on Your holy righteous word, Lord!


499
00:45:22.429 --> 00:45:25.193
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!

500
00:45:45.319 --> 00:45:46.877
As you were.

501
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:17.910
- General Almond.
- Colonel.


502
00:46:17.951 --> 00:46:20.784
I have a photo you should see, sir.

503
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:24.917
Forget that a minute. How bad
are the numbers from yesterday?


504
00:46:24.958 --> 00:46:27.552
- Bad, sir.
- And lke gets mad when he gives me


505
00:46:27.594 --> 00:46:30.427
waiters and shoeshine boys
to fight the Krauts with.


506
00:46:30.464 --> 00:46:33.490
Germans are dug in.
And that gun at La Spezia's killing us.


507
00:46:33.534 --> 00:46:37.994
Fifteen thousand colored soldiers.
One in four is a casualty.


508
00:46:38.038 --> 00:46:41.132
And all I'm hearing about
is one goddamned gun?


509
00:46:41.175 --> 00:46:45.077
We have guns, too, here.
Look, see, colonel? I got one.


510
00:46:45.112 --> 00:46:49.742
This colored division...
This is an experiment, Jack.


511
00:46:49.783 --> 00:46:54.846
An experiment. These are the first lady
Eleanor Roosevelt's niggers. Not ours.


512
00:46:54.888 --> 00:46:59.757
- Sir, I respectfully disagree.
- That's why they sent you here, Jack.


513
00:46:59.793 --> 00:47:02.557
To lead me into the New World.

514
00:47:04.264 --> 00:47:08.030
A gift from the Brits.
Taken at 11,000 feet. See?


515
00:47:08.068 --> 00:47:11.560
That's a German buildup at
Lama Di Sotto. Two or three regiments.


516
00:47:11.605 --> 00:47:14.540
- Surprise attack you worried about?
- I hope not.


517
00:47:14.575 --> 00:47:16.372
I got corroboration from a partisan.

518
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.901
Anybody crush grapes
with feet can't be trusted.


519
00:47:18.946 --> 00:47:20.846
Get some Krauts to confirm.

520
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:23.645
Already working on it, sir.
Captain Rudden!


521
00:47:26.987 --> 00:47:30.582
- Good evening, general.
- Come.


522
00:47:30.624 --> 00:47:34.321
Germans may be planning counter-
offensive down the Serchio Valley.


523
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:37.353
We need a POW to confirm.
You running patrols there?


524
00:47:37.397 --> 00:47:40.230
George Company has a squad
sitting right in that area.


525
00:47:40.267 --> 00:47:42.531
- How?
- They pushed across the Serchio


526
00:47:42.569 --> 00:47:46.266
beyond Hill Maine at the weak point.
I heard them call for artillery.


527
00:47:46.306 --> 00:47:50.504
Might've broken Jerry's hold
on the river. Captain Nokes didn't fire.


528
00:47:50.544 --> 00:47:53.308
- Why not?
- He couldn't see 'em, sir.


529
00:47:53.347 --> 00:47:55.781
Didn't believe they crossed,
they got hung up.


530
00:47:55.816 --> 00:47:59.252
I had Fox Company positioned
down the river from George Company.


531
00:47:59.286 --> 00:48:02.255
Got pretty hot over there.
Four of 'em right up a mountain.


532
00:48:02.289 --> 00:48:04.519
Got weapons and a radio
if they're alive.


533
00:48:04.558 --> 00:48:07.288
- Who are the four men?
- Shouldn't be hard to find out.


534
00:48:07.327 --> 00:48:09.795
One of them's the biggest Negro
you've ever seen in your life.


535
00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.855
Mmm.

536
00:48:11.899 --> 00:48:14.993
Very well then. Dismissed.

537
00:48:21.942 --> 00:48:24.410
[door shuts]

538
00:49:19.867 --> 00:49:22.199
[speaking German]
My God, I've had it.


539
00:49:22.236 --> 00:49:23.760
Come on, it's enough.

540
00:49:24.905 --> 00:49:25.929
Yeah, let's go.

541
00:49:27.741 --> 00:49:29.208
I need something to eat.

542
00:49:30.544 --> 00:49:34.605
[speaking Italian]
The Germans are leaving!


543
00:49:35.749 --> 00:49:38.547
[bell tolling]

544
00:49:44.358 --> 00:49:48.021
[speaking German] Push it up
or I'll kill it right now.


545
00:49:48.061 --> 00:49:49.892
I'm pushing as hard
as I can.


546
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.659
Pull, pull, pull.

547
00:49:51.698 --> 00:49:54.599
My goodness I'm hungry.

548
00:49:54.635 --> 00:49:58.901
Finally something to chew on,
rather than the slime they feed us.


549
00:50:02.843 --> 00:50:05.141
[in Italian] Goodbye meat.
Now there'll be nothing left.


550
00:50:05.178 --> 00:50:07.544
They won't get fat on it.

551
00:50:07.581 --> 00:50:09.139
Let's hope they choke on it.

552
00:50:09.182 --> 00:50:11.742
Shut up, the two of you!

553
00:50:11.785 --> 00:50:15.050
Now, let's see if your husband
will come back from Russia.


554
00:50:22.763 --> 00:50:24.230
Mary, Joseph, Jesus,

555
00:50:24.264 --> 00:50:27.028
tell us if we'll see him
or never see him again.


556
00:50:27.067 --> 00:50:28.557
Is he still alive?

557
00:50:28.602 --> 00:50:30.570
My eyes aren't
what they used to be.


558
00:50:30.604 --> 00:50:32.902
- [rattling table]
- Come on!


559
00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.237
So, so, so?

560
00:50:34.274 --> 00:50:37.607
We can't even joke? Come on.

561
00:50:39.012 --> 00:50:41.037
That thing is just a stupid kid's game.

562
00:50:41.081 --> 00:50:43.106
You're the usual scoundrel!

563
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:45.550
Just because he carries
the Fascist Party card,


564
00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:46.609
he thinks he can do what he wants.

565
00:50:46.653 --> 00:50:48.120
Oh yes?

566
00:50:48.155 --> 00:50:51.522
Then who was it who took butter
from the Germans the other day?


567
00:50:51.558 --> 00:50:52.650
The Pope?

568
00:50:52.693 --> 00:50:54.752
Maybe, because it wasn't us.

569
00:50:54.795 --> 00:50:56.092
And the light?

570
00:50:56.129 --> 00:50:57.687
How did your electricity come back on?

571
00:50:57.731 --> 00:50:58.891
Papa.

572
00:50:58.932 --> 00:51:00.092
Come with me.

573
00:51:00.133 --> 00:51:01.157
Come with me.

574
00:51:02.135 --> 00:51:03.693
How did the light come back on?

575
00:51:03.737 --> 00:51:06.570
The truth will never
come out of his mouth.


576
00:51:16.049 --> 00:51:18.210
You would think that
after all these years,


577
00:51:18.251 --> 00:51:20.879
you would treat your friends better.

578
00:51:20.921 --> 00:51:23.287
What is wrong with you, Papa?

579
00:51:23.323 --> 00:51:24.415
Would you tell me?

580
00:51:28.862 --> 00:51:30.591
It's Natalina.

581
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:32.063
What did she do?

582
00:51:32.099 --> 00:51:33.964
She put the evil
eye on me, that Witch.

583
00:51:34.001 --> 00:51:36.333
You still going on about the same story?

584
00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:39.601
The Germans stole your rabbits, not her.

585
00:51:41.141 --> 00:51:44.008
There's strange things going on.

586
00:51:44.044 --> 00:51:46.512
My electricity returned...

587
00:51:46.546 --> 00:51:48.446
from God knows where
after two and a half years.


588
00:51:48.482 --> 00:51:50.143
I was going to ask you about that.

589
00:51:50.183 --> 00:51:53.880
Now I'm lit up like a carnival...

590
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.651
for every bandit and German to see.

591
00:51:57.691 --> 00:52:01.354
It's Natalina's fault. She wants to see
me dead and buried behind the Church.


592
00:52:01.395 --> 00:52:02.794
What are you talking about?

593
00:52:04.564 --> 00:52:06.361
She prays for you every day.

594
00:52:08.535 --> 00:52:09.763
Know what I say?

595
00:52:10.971 --> 00:52:16.068
You go back in there
and apologize to your friends.


596
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:18.441
Tell everyone that
Mussolini disgusts you,


597
00:52:18.478 --> 00:52:21.208
and that you are not a Fascist anymore.

598
00:52:21.248 --> 00:52:25.412
Il Duce made us a world power again.

599
00:52:25.452 --> 00:52:28.285
His only mistake was to get in bed
with that imbecile Hitler.


600
00:52:28.321 --> 00:52:30.881
Papa, II Duce betrayed Italy.

601
00:52:30.924 --> 00:52:33.688
And now you'll see
how this is going to end.


602
00:52:33.727 --> 00:52:36.025
You are still so young, my child.

603
00:52:36.063 --> 00:52:37.963
You don't know the ways of the world.

604
00:52:37.998 --> 00:52:40.489
But you will learn.

605
00:52:40.534 --> 00:52:42.627
And from whom?

606
00:52:42.669 --> 00:52:44.000
From a Fascist like you?

607
00:52:45.005 --> 00:52:47.132
You're just like your mother.

608
00:52:47.174 --> 00:52:48.903
And she used to tell you
that Blackshirts


609
00:52:48.942 --> 00:52:50.842
are only good for hiding dirt.

610
00:52:50.877 --> 00:52:52.037
Okay, let's go.

611
00:52:56.083 --> 00:52:57.778
[knocking on door]

612
00:52:59.219 --> 00:53:00.584
Germans!!!

613
00:53:02.289 --> 00:53:03.381
It's your house.

614
00:53:14.267 --> 00:53:15.393
Holy Mother of God.

615
00:53:23.143 --> 00:53:24.474
It's okay.

616
00:53:24.511 --> 00:53:26.479
It's okay.

617
00:53:26.513 --> 00:53:27.605
It's okay, it's okay.

618
00:53:30.884 --> 00:53:33.512
Hector, ask who's in charge.
Tell them we're Americans.


619
00:53:37.624 --> 00:53:39.114
[in Italian] Americans?

620
00:53:39.159 --> 00:53:41.184
[in English] Me, too. Half.

621
00:53:41.228 --> 00:53:42.490
[in Italian] Half.

622
00:53:42.529 --> 00:53:45.123
[in English] Me sister Ida, half.

623
00:53:45.165 --> 00:53:47.929
[in Italian] We called her little Ida,
because she was the baby.


624
00:53:47.968 --> 00:53:50.232
Put us together,
we make one American.


625
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:51.703
[in Italian] Okay, wait. Wait.

626
00:53:51.738 --> 00:53:54.605
Wait. Wait. Wait.

627
00:53:54.641 --> 00:53:55.869
Thank you.

628
00:53:55.909 --> 00:53:57.171
Who's in charge here?

629
00:54:09.055 --> 00:54:11.523
Anybody here speak English?

630
00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.322
[in Italian]
Where are the Germans?


631
00:54:15.362 --> 00:54:18.593
Everywhere. Boom, boom.

632
00:54:18.632 --> 00:54:21.362
My name is Renata.

633
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:28.173
- Where'd you learn English?
- I was nanny for a British family.


634
00:54:28.208 --> 00:54:32.770
And a jolly good tuck-in-the-bed
tinkerer you must be.


635
00:54:32.812 --> 00:54:36.748
- You can nanny me. Want a Camel?
- Cool it, Bishop.


636
00:54:36.783 --> 00:54:40.947
I'm Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps.
We got a boy that needs help.


637
00:54:40.987 --> 00:54:42.716
[in Italian]
A boy? He has a boy.


638
00:54:44.925 --> 00:54:46.415
Oh, my God.

639
00:54:47.394 --> 00:54:49.487
Is he alive? Put him here.

640
00:54:49.529 --> 00:54:51.121
Slow. Slowly.

641
00:54:53.233 --> 00:54:54.962
Where did you find him?

642
00:54:55.001 --> 00:54:57.196
[Hector] On the Mountain.
Do you know him?


643
00:54:57.237 --> 00:54:59.296
[Natalina]
No, I don't know him.


644
00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:01.807
But he can stay here
until he gets better.


645
00:55:01.841 --> 00:55:05.038
Tell them we're taking the boy
to a hospital. They can come.


646
00:55:05.078 --> 00:55:08.309
They need to evacuate.
We'll escort them down the mountain.


647
00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:11.112
[in Italian] We're going to a hospital.
You can come with us.


648
00:55:11.985 --> 00:55:14.044
The hospital around the corner?

649
00:55:14.087 --> 00:55:16.282
The Germans are everywhere.

650
00:55:16.323 --> 00:55:18.348
Torrite, Rontano, Mezzana.

651
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:20.859
All the way to Barga
and down to the Serchio.


652
00:55:20.894 --> 00:55:23.692
I don't know how you
got past Vergemoli.


653
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:27.393
The only way to Pietrasanta...

654
00:55:27.434 --> 00:55:29.095
where the Americans might be...

655
00:55:29.135 --> 00:55:30.659
is over that way,

656
00:55:31.671 --> 00:55:33.696
over the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.

657
00:55:34.941 --> 00:55:36.169
Says we're surrounded.

658
00:55:36.209 --> 00:55:38.370
Doesn't know how we got
past German lines,


659
00:55:38.411 --> 00:55:41.642
but the only way we might find
some Americans is up there.


660
00:55:41.681 --> 00:55:44.047
- The Mountain of the Sleeping Man.
- Sleeping Man?


661
00:55:44.084 --> 00:55:47.485
- [in Italian] What is that?
- It's a legend.


662
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:53.481
A shepherd fell in love with a girl
who would not love him back.


663
00:55:53.526 --> 00:55:56.222
So he lays across the Mountain...

664
00:55:56.263 --> 00:55:58.663
to protect her from the wind and rain.

665
00:55:58.698 --> 00:56:02.896
He still lies there today,
to protect us all.


666
00:56:02.936 --> 00:56:07.305
Legend has it that
one day he will awaken.


667
00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:12.636
A legend about a shepherd
that fell in love...


668
00:56:12.679 --> 00:56:14.977
Whatever she's saying,
we gotta rest until sunup.


669
00:56:15.015 --> 00:56:17.279
- OK.
- Stay here? No, no.


670
00:56:17.317 --> 00:56:19.046
<i>Stay here. Si, si.</i>

671
00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:22.077
If they sing to the Krauts,
we will pull a trigger on this


672
00:56:22.122 --> 00:56:25.956
and tell the hammer to hurry. Won't be
nothing but powder and steel here.


673
00:56:25.992 --> 00:56:29.553
We are not Germans.
We are Italians.


674
00:56:29.596 --> 00:56:31.962
- Full blood.
- And what are we? Half blood?


675
00:56:34.567 --> 00:56:36.865
[in Italian]
We should take him...


676
00:56:36.903 --> 00:56:38.632
and put him to bed.

677
00:56:38.672 --> 00:56:41.903
The boy stays here. He's sick.

678
00:56:58.992 --> 00:57:00.459
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

679
00:57:29.989 --> 00:57:32.719
[in German]
Catching up on your reading?


680
00:57:32.759 --> 00:57:35.887
Yes, Colonel, I'm informing myself
about the enemy.


681
00:57:35.929 --> 00:57:40.263
The Partisans often take their names
from banned poetry and literature.


682
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.268
This helps us identify them.

683
00:57:42.302 --> 00:57:44.497
Who is the poet?

684
00:57:44.537 --> 00:57:46.266
Giovanni Pascoli.

685
00:57:46.306 --> 00:57:51.767
Do you think it's appropriate
to waste your time reading poetry?


686
00:57:51.811 --> 00:57:57.681
In the past nine months we've seen
a sharp rise in Partisan activity.


687
00:57:57.717 --> 00:58:00.015
What are you planning to do about it?

688
00:58:00.053 --> 00:58:04.114
Colonel, we are down
to shovels and mule shit.


689
00:58:04.157 --> 00:58:05.624
My men are exhausted.

690
00:58:05.658 --> 00:58:07.853
We need ammo and food.

691
00:58:07.894 --> 00:58:10.522
Food? You want food?

692
00:58:10.563 --> 00:58:13.259
You can suck icicles
in Russia...


693
00:58:13.299 --> 00:58:18.635
like you did before your so-called
neck wound brought you back here.


694
00:58:18.671 --> 00:58:22.232
You think you're the first
to command hungry troops?


695
00:58:22.275 --> 00:58:25.438
I mean no disrespect, Colonel.

696
00:58:27.113 --> 00:58:30.412
Good. Listen closely.

697
00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:33.317
I have come too far to repeat myself.

698
00:58:33.353 --> 00:58:37.619
First, there is a peasant, a terrorist.

699
00:58:37.657 --> 00:58:42.390
Named The Great Butterfly.
He's causing many problems.


700
00:58:42.429 --> 00:58:45.057
He's hiding in these mountains.
Find him.


701
00:58:45.098 --> 00:58:48.363
When he is found,
issue Directive Bandenbefehl...


702
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:51.063
to him and his criminal friends.

703
00:58:51.104 --> 00:58:52.162
Bandenbefehl?

704
00:58:52.205 --> 00:58:54.833
Is there an echo out here?

705
00:58:54.874 --> 00:58:59.004
General Kesselring's standing
field order for the Italian Republic.


706
00:58:59.045 --> 00:59:01.536
At a commander's sole discretion,

707
00:59:01.581 --> 00:59:04.379
for every one German soldier killed,

708
00:59:04.417 --> 00:59:06.783
we execute ten Italian civilians.

709
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:12.349
You should have been capable to execute
that order at least once in nine months.


710
00:59:12.392 --> 00:59:16.021
Colonel, with all due respect,
if I execute this order...


711
00:59:16.062 --> 00:59:18.587
my men would kill innocent civilians.

712
00:59:18.631 --> 00:59:22.260
It would be a violation
of the Geneva Convention.


713
00:59:22.302 --> 00:59:27.069
Partisans are not civilians;
they are terrorists.


714
00:59:27.106 --> 00:59:30.041
They are not protected
under the Geneva Convention.


715
00:59:30.076 --> 00:59:32.442
Bandenbefehl!

716
00:59:32.479 --> 00:59:33.639
Bandenbefehl.

717
00:59:35.982 --> 00:59:39.349
Secondly, the surprise
counterattack is still planned.


718
00:59:39.385 --> 00:59:43.879
I will tighten supply lines
with food and ammunition.


719
00:59:43.923 --> 00:59:46.221
And three:

720
00:59:46.259 --> 00:59:50.127
A delicate intelligence matter
of the utmost priority.


721
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:58.936
We are missing a Corporal...

722
00:59:58.972 --> 01:00:02.601
from the 35th Regiment,

723
01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:06.635
Name: Hans Brandt,
gone AWOL three weeks ago.


724
01:00:06.679 --> 01:00:09.648
[Eichholz] We have some every day.
What's so special about him?


725
01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:13.051
You and I are not here...

726
01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:16.920
to question the Führer's orders.

727
01:00:16.956 --> 01:00:19.516
You are to send out a search party.

728
01:00:19.559 --> 01:00:21.049
Find him.

729
01:00:21.094 --> 01:00:22.789
Don't let him escape.

730
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:24.820
And when you have him...

731
01:00:25.865 --> 01:00:28.732
get word to me immediately.

732
01:00:37.877 --> 01:00:39.606
Let's go!

733
01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:54.185
<i>[in Italian] If I am no longer
that lamp...</i>


734
01:00:54.227 --> 01:00:57.025
<i>which flickers in front
of a sweet Maria.</i>


735
01:00:57.063 --> 01:00:58.530
[in German] What does that mean?

736
01:00:59.766 --> 01:01:01.563
God help this poor bastard Brandt.

737
01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:03.834
Whatever he's done,

738
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:06.737
it's no worse than what anyone else
has done in this war.


739
01:01:07.473 --> 01:01:08.838
Mount a search party.

740
01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.866
We have to find him first,

741
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:13.902
hold him and give him a few days...

742
01:01:13.947 --> 01:01:17.041
before Pflueger pulls out
his teeth, one by one.


743
01:01:17.083 --> 01:01:18.107
Yes.

744
01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:20.917
I'll be relieved when this war is over.

745
01:01:20.954 --> 01:01:22.819
I want to return to my family.

746
01:01:51.851 --> 01:01:54.046
[in Italian]
I've watched you grow up.


747
01:01:54.087 --> 01:01:56.351
But you haven't become much.

748
01:01:56.389 --> 01:01:57.856
And he can't do much.

749
01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:59.755
- You're laughing at me?
- Of course.


750
01:01:59.792 --> 01:02:02.260
Where did you get that?

751
01:02:02.295 --> 01:02:03.785
So many things you want to know.

752
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:04.922
Here. Take it and eat.

753
01:02:04.964 --> 01:02:06.295
Give me some, too.

754
01:02:06.332 --> 01:02:08.596
Are you afraid you're
not going to get any?


755
01:02:08.635 --> 01:02:09.795
Here. Grow.

756
01:02:09.836 --> 01:02:11.463
Give me a chestnut, too.

757
01:02:13.139 --> 01:02:14.936
My goodness, you stink like a sheep.

758
01:02:14.974 --> 01:02:16.635
Hey, leave me alone.

759
01:02:16.676 --> 01:02:18.610
Aren't you the dandy?

760
01:02:18.645 --> 01:02:20.408
Ah, he's offended.

761
01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:28.413
What the fuck are you doing, Peppi?

762
01:02:28.454 --> 01:02:30.149
You have to be on the lookout.

763
01:02:30.189 --> 01:02:33.420
If I had been a German,
you would all be dead... 1, 2, 3.


764
01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:35.086
I almost choked.

765
01:02:36.129 --> 01:02:37.756
You wait here.

766
01:02:52.979 --> 01:02:54.241
My friend.

767
01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.544
The Americans are getting closer.

768
01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.808
We have to warn them about
the Germans' counterattack.


769
01:02:59.852 --> 01:03:01.979
They know it already, for sure.

770
01:03:03.056 --> 01:03:05.081
You? How are you?

771
01:03:05.124 --> 01:03:07.354
Me? I'm okay.

772
01:03:07.393 --> 01:03:08.451
You?

773
01:03:08.494 --> 01:03:10.985
I always have Marco's
face in front of my eyes.


774
01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:15.561
Don't worry about that.

775
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:20.834
My brother is dead.
Nobody cares about him any more.


776
01:03:20.873 --> 01:03:21.999
I care.

777
01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:23.440
In your opinion...

778
01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:25.742
when we will be in front of God,

779
01:03:25.778 --> 01:03:28.611
if we ever get there,

780
01:03:28.648 --> 01:03:31.617
is he going to ask us
for our political card?


781
01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:34.620
Is he going to say,
"Marco, no... Ludovico, no.


782
01:03:34.654 --> 01:03:38.146
You're not allowed in
because you're Fascists."


783
01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:42.787
What's the difference between
us and them in the eyes of God?


784
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:45.093
You're asking yourself
too many questions.


785
01:03:45.131 --> 01:03:48.726
If you think too much,
it will drive you crazy.


786
01:03:48.768 --> 01:03:51.362
And then who will kill the Germans?

787
01:03:51.404 --> 01:03:52.428
Hey.

788
01:03:54.674 --> 01:03:57.074
Anyway, what's done is done.

789
01:04:04.917 --> 01:04:09.217
George Company to 370,
George Company to 3-7, over.


790
01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:16.153
George Company to 370, over.

791
01:04:39.952 --> 01:04:42.648
[in Italian] Someone tell that
big beast to get out of my room.


792
01:04:42.688 --> 01:04:45.748
Shh! The Boy has a fever.

793
01:04:45.792 --> 01:04:48.420
He needs to eat and get some rest.

794
01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:50.452
Try thinking of others
every once in awhile.


795
01:05:00.373 --> 01:05:01.670
Arturo.

796
01:05:02.742 --> 01:05:05.210
The Chocolate Giant's Castle...

797
01:05:05.244 --> 01:05:07.075
if you could only see it.

798
01:05:07.113 --> 01:05:09.604
It's enormous.

799
01:05:09.649 --> 01:05:11.810
No, even bigger.

800
01:05:12.652 --> 01:05:15.212
Of course I saw it.

801
01:05:15.254 --> 01:05:17.381
It's all made of chocolate.

802
01:05:17.423 --> 01:05:19.391
You break a piece off,

803
01:05:19.425 --> 01:05:21.222
and it grows back.

804
01:05:23.362 --> 01:05:25.626
Yes, I did save a piece for you.

805
01:05:33.105 --> 01:05:34.595
Good heavens.

806
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.130
Something's not right.

807
01:05:36.175 --> 01:05:37.574
Someone put the evil eye on him.

808
01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:39.908
Bewitched or not, he's got to go.

809
01:05:39.946 --> 01:05:42.779
- To where?
- With the Americans.


810
01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:44.476
I think he brings good luck.
The Boy stays.


811
01:05:44.517 --> 01:05:46.144
This is my house.

812
01:05:46.185 --> 01:05:47.550
I have a house too.

813
01:05:48.521 --> 01:05:49.920
Natalina.

814
01:05:49.956 --> 01:05:51.446
What do you think?

815
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:54.550
I say this Boy
is talking to the Devil.

816
01:05:54.594 --> 01:05:56.118
We need a Priest here.

817
01:05:56.162 --> 01:05:58.323
He doesn't need a Priest.
He needs a Doctor.


818
01:05:58.364 --> 01:06:01.231
A Priest can take
the Devil out of him.


819
01:06:01.267 --> 01:06:04.293
Train, get up. 
We gotta book.

820
01:06:08.808 --> 01:06:10.002
[Train] Excuse me.

821
01:06:10.042 --> 01:06:13.478
Hey, boy. Hey.

822
01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:17.573
Time for you
to take your medicine again.


823
01:06:18.384 --> 01:06:19.942
Here it comes. Ready?

824
01:06:19.986 --> 01:06:22.648
[humming]

825
01:06:23.689 --> 01:06:26.180
There. Thank you.

826
01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.919
Get you some of that soup, boy.

827
01:06:30.997 --> 01:06:32.089
Mmm.

828
01:06:36.736 --> 01:06:39.534
- Yes.
- He would not eat before.


829
01:06:42.675 --> 01:06:44.233
Here you go, boy.

830
01:06:46.112 --> 01:06:48.046
It's all over your shirt.

831
01:06:50.783 --> 01:06:54.344
- Come on, boy. Let's go.
- [in Italian] My Chocolate Giant.


832
01:06:54.387 --> 01:06:58.255
- OK, sarge. We ready.
- Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.


833
01:06:58.291 --> 01:07:01.192
We? Boy, where the hell "we" goin'?

834
01:07:01.227 --> 01:07:03.320
You wasn't chiseling him,
we wouldn't be here.


835
01:07:03.362 --> 01:07:05.990
- You think Nokes is lookin' for us?
- What?


836
01:07:07.566 --> 01:07:10.330
Hector been tryin' to fix that radio
since we got here.


837
01:07:10.369 --> 01:07:12.132
- Shh!
- What?


838
01:07:15.975 --> 01:07:17.567
<i>Arrive- damn-derci.</i>

839
01:07:22.915 --> 01:07:28.285
Hector. We gotta bail. Ask the old man
if he'll show us another way outta here.


840
01:07:28.321 --> 01:07:31.722
- Maybe we can reach the 366.
- We can't get five feet outta here


841
01:07:31.757 --> 01:07:34.555
<i>without being flavor of the week
for the Guten Tags.</i>


842
01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:38.552
<i>These people survived for years
without mortars. Stay with the paisans.</i>


843
01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:41.896
You wanna stay here and play house,
go ahead, but I'm bookin'.


844
01:07:41.934 --> 01:07:45.529
Ask the old man if he'll show us
another way outta these mountains.


845
01:07:45.571 --> 01:07:50.201
Tell him we'll pay him. We got plenty of
that funny money they use around here.


846
01:07:50.242 --> 01:07:52.403
[speaks Italian]
Can you show us a safe path?


847
01:07:52.445 --> 01:07:54.310
There is no safe way.

848
01:07:54.347 --> 01:07:55.974
Germans. Boom! Boom!

849
01:07:56.174 --> 01:07:57.732
You know a way.

850
01:07:57.775 --> 01:08:00.972
Franco was the mailman,
ask him. I'm too old.


851
01:08:01.012 --> 01:08:04.379
Me? I have to deliver the mail.

852
01:08:04.415 --> 01:08:06.474
What mail, you old crazy fool?

853
01:08:06.518 --> 01:08:10.181
Old crazy fool? You're the old crazy,
like your mother and your father.


854
01:08:10.221 --> 01:08:12.451
- I know.
- You know?


855
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:15.823
I know a way. I take you.

856
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.327
[in Italian] What did you say?

857
01:08:19.597 --> 01:08:21.929
What did my daughter say?

858
01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:24.764
[in Italian] I have
nothing to do with this.


859
01:08:24.802 --> 01:08:27.498
Bishop. What you think?

860
01:08:27.539 --> 01:08:31.339
Little Red Riding Hood
lead us through the woods?


861
01:08:31.376 --> 01:08:33.844
I don't know, sarge.

862
01:08:33.878 --> 01:08:38.178
I mean, she fine. 
Man, she fine.

863
01:08:38.216 --> 01:08:42.243
I hear that they got
lady Mussolinis, too.


864
01:08:42.287 --> 01:08:44.255
Could be a trap.

865
01:08:46.858 --> 01:08:48.849
Hector.

866
01:08:48.893 --> 01:08:51.293
You the boss, staff sergeant.

867
01:08:51.329 --> 01:08:54.093
No good. No. No good.

868
01:08:55.533 --> 01:08:58.900
All of a sudden the old man
speaks some English, huh?


869
01:09:02.006 --> 01:09:03.496
[in Italian] Are you crazy in the head?

870
01:09:03.541 --> 01:09:04.940
Keep out of this.

871
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.334
I forbid you to go.

872
01:09:07.378 --> 01:09:10.472
I don't need your permission.
Understand?


873
01:09:10.515 --> 01:09:12.710
You're still my daughter.

874
01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:16.709
Look, we'll find a way
outta here. Let's go.


875
01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:31.226
<i>Bye-bye, Americani.</i>

876
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:33.237
Renata. Come away.

877
01:09:33.271 --> 01:09:34.465
No!

878
01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.970
Oh!

879
01:09:38.009 --> 01:09:41.911
Cigarette? Chocolate?

880
01:09:41.946 --> 01:09:43.675
[Stamps] Hell, no!

881
01:09:46.084 --> 01:09:47.608
[in Italian] Shove it up your ass.

882
01:09:49.721 --> 01:09:53.817
Sergeant Stamps out there
fussin' over what side to get back to.


883
01:09:53.858 --> 01:09:57.021
It don't mean nothin', boy.

884
01:09:57.061 --> 01:09:59.529
Me, I ain't got a side.

885
01:10:03.034 --> 01:10:06.731
[speaking Italian] Arturo said
that if you turn your head...


886
01:10:06.771 --> 01:10:08.363
it will be my birthday.

887
01:10:08.406 --> 01:10:12.467
I'll get toys and lots of candy.

888
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:14.842
Now, please turn your head.

889
01:10:15.813 --> 01:10:17.804
Please turn your head.

890
01:10:19.417 --> 01:10:23.148
I can't understand your words, boy.

891
01:10:23.187 --> 01:10:25.087
But I don't need to.

892
01:10:25.123 --> 01:10:30.060
You see, everything you touch,
you brings good to it. You do.


893
01:10:31.462 --> 01:10:34.989
See this little thing here?
lt'll make you invisible.


894
01:10:35.033 --> 01:10:40.733
Give you the strength of five people.
You ain't got to own nothin'.


895
01:10:40.772 --> 01:10:43.400
Ain't got to be a big somebody.

896
01:10:43.441 --> 01:10:47.036
All you got to do
is believe in it, boy.

897
01:10:50.248 --> 01:10:52.239
Go on, boy. Go on.

898
01:10:57.255 --> 01:11:00.019
[in Italian] Can you turn
your head like this? See?


899
01:11:00.058 --> 01:11:03.755
God made this thing here
through man's hand.


900
01:11:03.795 --> 01:11:09.256
But the Lord gived it
shape and purpose.


901
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.768
And through this little thing here,

902
01:11:11.803 --> 01:11:14.704
God gives you somethin' else, boy.

903
01:11:14.739 --> 01:11:18.505
You know what it is?
I'ma tell ya, I'ma tell ya.


904
01:11:18.543 --> 01:11:20.272
It's a secret.

905
01:11:21.379 --> 01:11:22.778
Miracles.

906
01:11:25.683 --> 01:11:27.514
[in Italian] Listen, 
Chocolate Giant.

907
01:11:27.552 --> 01:11:29.486
You've got to do what I say.

908
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.318
Turn your head
so it will be my birthday.


909
01:11:32.357 --> 01:11:34.552
You want me
to stay eight forever?


910
01:11:36.094 --> 01:11:37.493
Turn your head.

911
01:11:38.696 --> 01:11:40.357
Arturo!

912
01:11:41.032 --> 01:11:43.364
Yes! I did it!

913
01:11:43.401 --> 01:11:44.891
I'm nine years old!

914
01:11:44.936 --> 01:11:47.700
Hey! Yes!

915
01:11:47.739 --> 01:11:49.434
Nine years old!

916
01:11:49.874 --> 01:11:51.466
Hurray!

917
01:11:51.509 --> 01:11:52.976
Nine years old!

918
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.341
Boy, you got the spirit?

919
01:11:54.379 --> 01:11:56.973
[Arturo, in Italian]
I did it! Nine years old!


920
01:11:57.014 --> 01:12:00.472
You know up high, down low?
Gimme five.


921
01:12:00.518 --> 01:12:03.351
Gimme five. All right. All right.

922
01:12:03.388 --> 01:12:05.549
Up high.

923
01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:10.988
Up high, gimme five. OK.

924
01:12:11.028 --> 01:12:13.861
Gimme five. Gimme five.

925
01:12:13.898 --> 01:12:17.197
Up high. Down low.

926
01:12:17.235 --> 01:12:19.430
Down low. Too slow.

927
01:12:23.007 --> 01:12:25.271
You know that one? Gimme five.

928
01:12:25.309 --> 01:12:27.004
Up high.

929
01:12:27.044 --> 01:12:28.568
Down low.

930
01:12:28.613 --> 01:12:30.103
Too slow.

931
01:12:31.382 --> 01:12:33.646
Let's see if I got some chocolate here.

932
01:12:35.653 --> 01:12:37.348
You like chocolate?

933
01:12:37.388 --> 01:12:39.618
[giggles]

934
01:12:39.657 --> 01:12:42.148
Yeah.

935
01:12:42.193 --> 01:12:43.660
How'd I get up here?

936
01:12:43.694 --> 01:12:47.152
The only place where
the Germans would not be


937
01:12:47.198 --> 01:12:50.497
is through the mountain
in Pietrasanta, Lucca.


938
01:12:50.535 --> 01:12:53.504
It's here. See?

939
01:12:53.538 --> 01:12:57.941
And that's where I think you
gonna find your people.


940
01:12:57.975 --> 01:13:01.240
- Here you go, Hector.
- Thanks, Train.


941
01:13:09.187 --> 01:13:10.586
Boy!

942
01:13:14.892 --> 01:13:17.019
[speaking Italian]
How do you know?


943
01:13:17.061 --> 01:13:18.255
Is that true?

944
01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:21.355
Yeah, I know.

945
01:13:21.399 --> 01:13:22.730
[in Italian]
Who are you talking to?


946
01:13:22.767 --> 01:13:24.894
- To Arturo.
- Arturo?


947
01:13:24.936 --> 01:13:25.960
Who's Arturo?

948
01:13:26.003 --> 01:13:27.334
My friend.

949
01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.739
And where is he?

950
01:13:32.009 --> 01:13:34.034
Over there, do you see?

951
01:13:34.078 --> 01:13:36.137
He's shy in front of other people.

952
01:13:46.457 --> 01:13:47.651
Hey.

953
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.781
Arturo, what do you think?

954
01:14:18.389 --> 01:14:19.617
Shall we help him?

955
01:14:21.158 --> 01:14:22.921
<i>[man on radio]
Three-seventy to Stamps.</i>


956
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.587
[in Italian] We did it.

957
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:27.120
<i>Three-seventy to Stamps.</i>

958
01:14:27.164 --> 01:14:30.133
Three-seventy to Stamps. Over.

959
01:14:34.105 --> 01:14:38.064
Three-seventy, this is Negron,
George Company, over.


960
01:14:38.109 --> 01:14:40.475
Got him, sir. I got the lost squad.

961
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:42.206
Get up.

962
01:14:42.246 --> 01:14:46.910
- Stamps, you need to get in here!
- Hallelujah.


963
01:14:46.951 --> 01:14:49.351
I think the kid fixed the radio, man.

964
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:55.686
- Who am I speaking with?
- Staff Sergeant Stamps.


965
01:14:55.726 --> 01:14:58.854
Staff Sergeant Stamps.
Send position, over.


966
01:14:58.896 --> 01:15:02.388
West of Borgo a Mozzano. We can see
the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.


967
01:15:02.433 --> 01:15:05.630
The Mount... The what?
Where's that in relation to here?


968
01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:08.138
West of the Serchio River someplace.
Over.


969
01:15:08.172 --> 01:15:11.141
Don't know how you got there,
we gonna make the most of it.


970
01:15:11.175 --> 01:15:13.973
- Seen any German sons of bitches?
- Have I seen any Krauts?


971
01:15:14.011 --> 01:15:16.639
No, motherfucker, just Cab
Calloway and his orchestra.


972
01:15:16.681 --> 01:15:18.080
Shh!

973
01:15:19.383 --> 01:15:21.817
Negative. But we think we're surrounded.

974
01:15:21.852 --> 01:15:25.219
Good. We want you to capture
a Nazi bastard. That's important.


975
01:15:25.256 --> 01:15:27.884
<i>[Nokes] We need to extract ASAP. Over.</i>

976
01:15:27.925 --> 01:15:32.362
Just get the Jerry and hold tight. That
is a direct order from General Almond.


977
01:15:32.396 --> 01:15:35.627
<i>- [Stamps] Hold tight with what? Over!
- I just gave you an order.</i>


978
01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:37.224
Now, you get that Jerry.

979
01:15:37.268 --> 01:15:41.864
<i>I will radio you
tomorrow at 0400.</i>


980
01:15:41.906 --> 01:15:45.740
And don't get yourself
shot up. Out.


981
01:15:47.878 --> 01:15:51.314
Fine. Bishop, follow me.

982
01:15:51.349 --> 01:15:52.646
Oh, man.

983
01:15:57.622 --> 01:15:59.317
This is a joke.

984
01:15:59.357 --> 01:16:02.349
First, your ace-boon-coon
giant goes off the deep end,


985
01:16:02.393 --> 01:16:05.692
now this God-and-country redneck
wants me to fetch a prisoner.


986
01:16:05.730 --> 01:16:09.097
- Something's cookin' around here.
- Thought you liked Nokes.


987
01:16:09.133 --> 01:16:12.034
- Who said I liked him?
- I seen you shinin' up to him.


988
01:16:12.069 --> 01:16:15.061
I ain't runnin' around
with sleeves cuffing poker cards


989
01:16:15.106 --> 01:16:18.166
don't mean I like Nokes.
Besides, he ain't the worst.


990
01:16:18.209 --> 01:16:20.871
The man left us high
and dry at the Serchio.


991
01:16:20.911 --> 01:16:24.711
Hear you tell it, you told the man
three times to fire that 105,


992
01:16:24.749 --> 01:16:27.115
- and he didn't.
- He ain't the first white man


993
01:16:27.151 --> 01:16:31.144
don't trust colored folks' word.
The knife cuts both ways, Bishop.


994
01:16:31.188 --> 01:16:33.713
Nokes reports to Driscoll.
Driscoll's fair.


995
01:16:33.758 --> 01:16:38.058
Shit, nigga, is you crazy? The only
reason white folks is thinkin' now


996
01:16:38.095 --> 01:16:41.428
about bein' fair in this Army
is Krauts is cuttin' their toenails


997
01:16:41.465 --> 01:16:43.990
too short and they runnin'
outta whites to die.


998
01:16:44.035 --> 01:16:46.333
Don't matter.
They said we couldn't fight.


999
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:49.703
Had us float balloons, work as
quartermasters, cook and clean.


1000
01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:52.675
The 92nd proved we can fight.
This is our country, too.


1001
01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:56.111
We helped build it from the ground up.
I'm here for my children


1002
01:16:56.147 --> 01:16:59.446
and future grandchildren,
Bishop! This is about progress!


1003
01:16:59.483 --> 01:17:03.317
Nigga, please. Prog...

1004
01:17:03.354 --> 01:17:05.345
You know what?

1005
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:10.321
Staff Sergeant,
you remember this progress?


1006
01:17:12.663 --> 01:17:14.790
Mm-hm.

1007
01:17:25.876 --> 01:17:28.640
- Tellin' you. Lena Horne.
- And Satchel Paige?


1008
01:17:28.679 --> 01:17:31.045
Satchel Paige owe me $20.

1009
01:17:31.082 --> 01:17:34.347
- You know 'em both?
- In and out.


1010
01:17:34.385 --> 01:17:37.354
We only got an hour before
we gotta be back for maneuvers.


1011
01:17:37.388 --> 01:17:41.222
Colonel Driscoll coming to
watch, too. Bishop, you hear me?


1012
01:17:41.258 --> 01:17:42.850
I ain't studyin' Driscoll.

1013
01:17:42.893 --> 01:17:44.884
[indistinct chatter]

1014
01:17:48.766 --> 01:17:50.324
Contest winner right there.

1015
01:17:52.603 --> 01:17:54.833
- Afternoon, fellas.
- Howdy.


1016
01:17:56.373 --> 01:17:58.603
See we got some
Krauts up in here.


1017
01:17:58.642 --> 01:18:00.007
[in German] Soon we'll be
going back home.


1018
01:18:00.044 --> 01:18:01.568
Nobody believes that.

1019
01:18:01.612 --> 01:18:05.207
He just wants to visit
his girlfriend.


1020
01:18:05.249 --> 01:18:07.740
- Yep.
- What do you boys want?


1021
01:18:07.785 --> 01:18:10.379
No problem. We looking
for some good old ice slops.


1022
01:18:10.421 --> 01:18:12.184
Go around back.
I'll get you some.


1023
01:18:13.691 --> 01:18:14.715
Train.

1024
01:18:17.661 --> 01:18:20.255
They went 'round back, too?

1025
01:18:21.332 --> 01:18:23.698
Nigra, who I serve
is my damn business.


1026
01:18:23.734 --> 01:18:25.895
Hitler's goose-steppers
you feeding.


1027
01:18:25.936 --> 01:18:28.962
Want me to eat out a trough
in the backyard like I'm some pig?


1028
01:18:29.006 --> 01:18:31.531
You want me to
shoot you in the head?


1029
01:18:32.276 --> 01:18:33.436
Calm down!

1030
01:18:33.477 --> 01:18:35.775
Put the goddamn gun down, Herb!

1031
01:18:35.813 --> 01:18:39.112
- We're all Americans here.
- Whose side you on? Theirs or ours?


1032
01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:42.745
- Respect the uniform.
- I'll tell you what, all right?


1033
01:18:42.787 --> 01:18:45.813
- I'll pay for the damn ice slops.
- Whose side are you on?


1034
01:18:45.856 --> 01:18:48.825
- You want this whole shop off-limits?
- Wish you'd try.


1035
01:18:48.859 --> 01:18:51.089
We got the ice cream, guys.

1036
01:18:51.128 --> 01:18:56.031
Suggest you boys find your way
back to base. You understand me?


1037
01:18:56.066 --> 01:18:58.796
Get these Jerrys out quick.
Move, goddamn it, move!


1038
01:18:58.836 --> 01:19:01.862
<i>Get on your goddamn feet!
Schnell, goddamn it, schnell!</i>


1039
01:19:01.906 --> 01:19:05.774
- I don't have all goddamn day!
- I don't have time for this shit.


1040
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.571
Goddamn it!
Pick up your goddamn feet!


1041
01:19:12.616 --> 01:19:15.585
<i>Didn't your Fuhrer teach
you how to march, boys? Move it!</i>


1042
01:19:17.655 --> 01:19:22.058
What y'all niggers waiting on?
Y'all deaf nigras? Go on.


1043
01:19:22.092 --> 01:19:26.722
It's time for you to go.
Wanna get strung up? Go on!


1044
01:19:26.764 --> 01:19:30.700
It's whites only in here. You tell
your friends they're not welcome here.


1045
01:19:30.734 --> 01:19:34.261
You spread the news.
You big baboon! Go on, git!


1046
01:19:34.305 --> 01:19:36.170
Git!

1047
01:19:37.842 --> 01:19:42.176
- Stamps, what happened?
- [Herb] Lucky this time.


1048
01:19:42.213 --> 01:19:44.943
Bishop? Where the ice slops?

1049
01:19:50.287 --> 01:19:54.246
There's a lesson for you, son.
That's how you treat these animals.


1050
01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:56.191
Mm-hm.

1051
01:20:30.427 --> 01:20:31.894
[guns cocking]

1052
01:20:51.882 --> 01:20:56.819
Between the nigra in uniform and free
yellow-bellied Japs running around,


1053
01:20:56.854 --> 01:20:59.846
country's gone to
hell in a handbasket.


1054
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.868
- Put 'em down.
- Oh, shit.


1055
01:21:11.902 --> 01:21:15.998
Good afternoon. Look, you
cock-a-doodle-doo Bumfuck, Louisiana


1056
01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.703
motherfucker, I want my five
ice slops with a cherry on top.


1057
01:21:19.743 --> 01:21:22.177
Right there where you
served them Jerrys at.


1058
01:21:22.212 --> 01:21:24.305
- Sure.
- Wash your hands 'fore you serve


1059
01:21:24.348 --> 01:21:28.409
since you was likely yanking
those Krauts' cocks all morning.


1060
01:21:28.452 --> 01:21:31.785
Please, I got my wife and my son
here. Please, just take it easy.


1061
01:21:31.822 --> 01:21:33.847
We'll do whatever you like.

1062
01:21:33.891 --> 01:21:37.292
- [woman] It's OK.
- Stamps.


1063
01:21:37.328 --> 01:21:39.558
I changed my mind.
Make it to go.


1064
01:21:39.596 --> 01:21:42.963
I wouldn't get caught dead
eatin' in a shithole like this.


1065
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.434
Vera? We got some paper cups
for these gentlemen?


1066
01:21:45.469 --> 01:21:47.437
- Come on, cracker.
- [Vera] Just a second.


1067
01:21:47.471 --> 01:21:49.268
- Hurry up.
- [Herb] How many are ya?


1068
01:21:49.306 --> 01:21:51.604
- [Stamps] Five.
- [Herb] Five on the house.


1069
01:21:51.642 --> 01:21:53.109
[Bishop] Come on, boy, git!

1070
01:21:53.143 --> 01:21:55.668
- [Herb] Cherries as well?
- [Bishop] I said cherries!


1071
01:21:55.713 --> 01:21:57.943
- [Herb] Cherries it is.
- [Bishop] Hurry up.


1072
01:21:57.982 --> 01:22:00.542
[Herb] Get the top
off of that for me.


1073
01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:04.020
- [Bishop] Now, come on, boy.
- [Herb] As fast as I can here.


1074
01:22:37.855 --> 01:22:41.416
[Train] OK, boy. We got to

I repeat, we have a German. Over.

1229
01:34:50.854 --> 01:34:54.153
<i>[man on radio] George Company,
stay put. We'll get back to you. Out.</i>


1230
01:34:54.190 --> 01:34:55.555
Roger. Out.

1231
01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.525
[in Italian] So, how did you get lights?

1232
01:35:02.298 --> 01:35:03.560
I don't know.

1233
01:35:04.934 --> 01:35:06.458
It was a Miracle.

1234
01:35:06.503 --> 01:35:09.597
Do you know what
the real Miracle is?


1235
01:35:09.639 --> 01:35:11.197
Is that you're still alive.

1236
01:35:31.895 --> 01:35:32.919
[spits]

1237
01:35:40.170 --> 01:35:42.536
[door opens, closes]

1238
01:35:43.439 --> 01:35:45.703
[Hector] Train, 
Nokes is coming.

1239
01:35:45.742 --> 01:35:48.142
He's comin' himself.

1240
01:35:48.178 --> 01:35:52.239
[Train] Something goin' on, Hec.
Something bad.


1241
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:57.017
Nobody think the boy see nothin'.

1242
01:35:57.053 --> 01:35:59.180
But he sees it all.

1243
01:36:01.925 --> 01:36:03.825
I know, big guy.

1244
01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.385
That I know.

1245
01:36:06.429 --> 01:36:09.728
You think I gotta give him back
when the captain comes?


1246
01:36:11.467 --> 01:36:16.131
I know how close you are to him,
Train, but that's not my call.


1247
01:36:16.172 --> 01:36:18.003
I need to talk to him now.

1248
01:36:21.044 --> 01:36:23.444
- Go on.
- Thank you.


1249
01:36:26.049 --> 01:36:27.846
[speaking Italian] So,

1250
01:36:27.884 --> 01:36:29.852
how are you feeling?

1251
01:36:29.886 --> 01:36:30.910
Want a chocolate?

1252
01:36:32.088 --> 01:36:33.112
It's good.

1253
01:36:37.193 --> 01:36:38.820
I need your help.

1254
01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.930
- Train?
- Hey, boy.


1255
01:36:53.743 --> 01:36:55.233
[in Italian] What's your name?

1256
01:36:56.212 --> 01:36:58.703
Angelo. Angelo Torancelli.

1257
01:36:59.682 --> 01:37:01.877
[in Italian] Me, I'm Hector.

1258
01:37:02.652 --> 01:37:04.051
Where are you from?

1259
01:37:04.087 --> 01:37:06.146
From St. Anna di Stazzema.

1260
01:37:07.457 --> 01:37:08.924
Angelo...

1261
01:37:08.958 --> 01:37:10.619
that German...

1262
01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:11.684
do you know him?

1263
01:37:12.896 --> 01:37:16.161
Yes. There were a lot of them.

1264
01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.564
What did he tell you just now?

1265
01:37:19.602 --> 01:37:22.298
He told me what he told me before.

1266
01:37:22.338 --> 01:37:24.806
He told me to run
as fast as I can.

1267
01:37:24.841 --> 01:37:25.899
When?

1268
01:37:25.942 --> 01:37:29.434
Before. At the fire. 
At the Church.

1269
01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:33.341
What fire?

1270
01:37:35.919 --> 01:37:37.614
Angelo.

1271
01:37:37.654 --> 01:37:39.554
Your father and your mother...

1272
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:41.557
Where is your father and your mother?

1273
01:37:42.759 --> 01:37:44.784
[crying]

1274
01:37:47.563 --> 01:37:51.192
- Oh, Hec, leave him be.
- Train, please.


1275
01:37:51.234 --> 01:37:53.065
Just one more thing.

1276
01:37:57.874 --> 01:37:59.808
[in Italian] Why are you
so afraid of him?


1277
01:37:59.842 --> 01:38:01.833
I'm not afraid of him.

1278
01:38:01.878 --> 01:38:03.402
He's my friend.

1279
01:38:03.446 --> 01:38:05.141
I'm afraid of the other one.

1280
01:38:05.181 --> 01:38:06.239
What other one?

1281
01:38:12.055 --> 01:38:13.886
[sobbing]

1282
01:38:24.133 --> 01:38:26.897
[angry crowd noise building]

1283
01:38:35.178 --> 01:38:36.543
[in Italian] Murderer!

1284
01:38:36.579 --> 01:38:37.773
- Nazi! Dirty pig!
- Burn in hell!


1285
01:38:37.814 --> 01:38:39.338
Send that son of a whore out here!

1286
01:38:39.382 --> 01:38:40.940
Get back!

1287
01:38:40.984 --> 01:38:42.349
We'll rip his eyes out!

1288
01:38:42.385 --> 01:38:43.852
Butterfly!

1289
01:38:48.091 --> 01:38:49.285
Who threw that?

1290
01:38:52.095 --> 01:38:53.221
Give him to us!

1291
01:38:53.262 --> 01:38:54.286
We want him now!

1292
01:38:56.599 --> 01:38:57.623
[all screaming]

1293
01:39:02.572 --> 01:39:03.732
Go, go, go!

1294
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:07.373
You have two days. No more. Tell them!

1295
01:39:07.410 --> 01:39:09.207
He says you have two days. No more.

1296
01:39:09.245 --> 01:39:10.644
[in Italian] He'll stay here.

1297
01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.171
He will leave his man.

1298
01:39:16.853 --> 01:39:19.287
- Where's he goin'?
- I don't know.


1299
01:39:19.322 --> 01:39:21.552
[in Italian] I need
another pair of eyes.


1300
01:39:21.591 --> 01:39:24.992
- When is Nokes comin'?
- Soon. He's comin' himself.


1301
01:39:25.028 --> 01:39:26.893
- It's time that we all go.
- Where?


1302
01:39:28.164 --> 01:39:30.632
[in Italian] Excuse me.
Can we have a moment?


1303
01:39:33.269 --> 01:39:35.100
Train's kid. All right?

1304
01:39:35.138 --> 01:39:38.630
He's talkin' that he's seen a church,
a fire, the Italian guy.


1305
01:39:38.674 --> 01:39:40.767
Which church, fire? 
Which Italian guy?

1306
01:39:40.810 --> 01:39:43.904
I don't know. He's seen something bad,
he's definitely seen him.


1307
01:39:43.946 --> 01:39:45.641
I seen him, too. So what?

1308
01:39:45.681 --> 01:39:47.546
The kid hasn't talked in days.

1309
01:39:47.583 --> 01:39:49.881
All of a sudden he sees
him and he's talkin'?


1310
01:39:49.919 --> 01:39:52.387
- It ain't right.
- That's just skippy,


1311
01:39:52.422 --> 01:39:55.186
but I ain't got time
to talk to him right now.


1312
01:39:55.224 --> 01:39:57.158
You, come here.

1313
01:39:57.193 --> 01:40:00.185
Gather who will come,
we'll take 'em down the mountain.


1314
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:02.026
- We do not come with you.
- Why not?


1315
01:40:02.065 --> 01:40:04.295
- Nazis in all villages.
- Yeah. Boom, boom.


1316
01:40:04.333 --> 01:40:06.824
Sit tight and it'll
be jingle bells real soon.


1317
01:40:06.869 --> 01:40:08.962
The U.S. Army's sittin' in front of you.

1318
01:40:09.005 --> 01:40:12.236
We need Army inside house now!
Three years we've been waiting.


1319
01:40:12.275 --> 01:40:15.938
First the British, then the Americans.
Italy is tired to wait.


1320
01:40:16.946 --> 01:40:20.074
Let's talk to your partisan.

1321
01:40:20.116 --> 01:40:23.176
Ask your friend to climb the
ridge and tell us what he sees.


1322
01:40:23.219 --> 01:40:26.154
[in Italian] He wants you
to go up the Mountain...


1323
01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:27.451
and tell us what you see.

1324
01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:28.923
Come on.

1325
01:40:43.306 --> 01:40:46.503
- I don't trust that guy.
- He's a good man.


1326
01:40:46.542 --> 01:40:49.306
He's a partisan. 
He's from this valley.

1327
01:40:49.345 --> 01:40:52.212
- She grew up with him.
- Yeah. OK. Great.


1328
01:40:52.248 --> 01:40:56.617
I don't care if he's Frank Sinatra
or Joltin' Joe DiMaggio himself.


1329
01:40:56.652 --> 01:40:59.712
Somethin' about his eyes
I just don't trust.


1330
01:41:14.103 --> 01:41:16.401
Mm-hm.

1331
01:42:04.654 --> 01:42:07.179
G.I. G.I. G.I.

1332
01:42:08.624 --> 01:42:11.184
Hey! Alessio!

1333
01:42:11.227 --> 01:42:14.924
You ring that motherfuckin' bell
you see Hitler!


1334
01:42:14.964 --> 01:42:17.125
I got more of this
Hershey's for ya!


1335
01:42:17.166 --> 01:42:18.463
[laughs]

1336
01:42:18.501 --> 01:42:21.493
G.I. G.I. G.I.

1337
01:42:35.051 --> 01:42:36.075
[in Italian] Well?

1338
01:42:37.253 --> 01:42:38.311
Is it safe?

1339
01:42:39.455 --> 01:42:41.389
Yes, it's safe. Yes.

1340
01:42:41.424 --> 01:42:42.482
Good.

1341
01:42:42.525 --> 01:42:44.857
- Is it good?
- It's safe.


1342
01:42:44.894 --> 01:42:46.361
Here, take your Kraut.

1343
01:42:46.395 --> 01:42:47.828
[in Italian] Come with me.

1344
01:42:47.863 --> 01:42:49.421
Go.

1345
01:42:49.465 --> 01:42:52.059
- Hector, watch both of them.
- Gladly.


1346
01:42:52.735 --> 01:42:54.100
After you.

1347
01:42:57.573 --> 01:42:59.268
[Hector speaking Spanish] What's that?

1348
01:42:59.308 --> 01:43:01.299
[speaking Italian]
I don't understand Spanish.


1349
01:43:01.344 --> 01:43:02.868
[in Italian] What is that?

1350
01:43:02.912 --> 01:43:03.970
A cigarette.

1351
01:43:04.013 --> 01:43:06.413
No, that's not a cigarette.

1352
01:43:07.617 --> 01:43:09.016
American cigarettes.

1353
01:43:10.786 --> 01:43:12.413
Good.

1354
01:43:12.455 --> 01:43:13.683
Very good.

1355
01:43:17.526 --> 01:43:18.788
What's your name?

1356
01:43:19.695 --> 01:43:20.855
Rodolfo.

1357
01:43:20.896 --> 01:43:22.523
Hector.

1358
01:43:22.565 --> 01:43:26.262
[Birdsong] Men, take a knee and bow.

1359
01:43:28.371 --> 01:43:29.963
[in Italian] God Almighty.

1360
01:43:30.006 --> 01:43:32.873
[in German] The tree of life blossoms
beside the shore of still waters.


1361
01:43:32.908 --> 01:43:38.210
The face of Christ is shining,
and it needs no candle, no light...


1362
01:43:38.247 --> 01:43:40.511
[in Italian] Nor Sun.

1363
01:43:40.549 --> 01:43:43.143
There is no suffering in your Kingdom.

1364
01:43:43.185 --> 01:43:46.245
And we ask for your forgiveness
merciful Father...


1365
01:43:46.289 --> 01:43:49.122
[in German] that we have not seen
the light before this day.


1366
01:43:49.158 --> 01:43:51.251
For your light reigns forever.

1367
01:43:51.294 --> 01:43:53.922
It is a shining beacon that lights
the path to your heavenly throne.


1368
01:43:53.963 --> 01:43:57.228
[Birdsong] I may not be the man
that you want me to be, O Lord.


1369
01:43:57.266 --> 01:44:00.099
I may not be the man that
I should have been, O God.


1370
01:44:00.136 --> 01:44:02.070
[in German] But we are your people.

1371
01:44:02.104 --> 01:44:06.734
[in Italian] We ask you, Lord, to walk
with us in our pain and our suffering.


1372
01:44:06.776 --> 01:44:09.609
...as a nation of your children
who glorify your name...


1373
01:44:09.645 --> 01:44:11.203
[in Italian] in victory.

1374
01:44:11.247 --> 01:44:13.477
- Amen.
- [all] Amen.


1375
01:44:13.516 --> 01:44:14.915
[all] Amen.

1376
01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.154
Amen.

1377
01:44:28.931 --> 01:44:31.399
- [distant explosion]
- [gasps]


1378
01:44:31.434 --> 01:44:33.664
Easy, boy.

1379
01:44:33.703 --> 01:44:37.469
Ain't got to go jumpin'
every hank and rustle come along.


1380
01:44:37.506 --> 01:44:39.633
Here. Go on.

1381
01:44:39.675 --> 01:44:41.267
Yeah.

1382
01:44:46.082 --> 01:44:49.779
Hey. You, uh...

1383
01:44:49.819 --> 01:44:54.188
You still tryin' to hump
that piece of shit off on somebody?


1384
01:44:54.223 --> 01:44:57.590
You ought not use them type
of bad words around the boy, Bishop.


1385
01:44:59.228 --> 01:45:01.389
Shit.

1386
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:03.364
He don't understand.

1387
01:45:05.067 --> 01:45:07.058
Go on inside, boy. Go on.

1388
01:45:11.107 --> 01:45:14.634
How about all that preachin'
you do back home, Bishop?


1389
01:45:14.677 --> 01:45:16.770
Don't you believe in God?

1390
01:45:20.716 --> 01:45:23.844
Well, now, I believes in it
at the time I'm preachin' it.


1391
01:45:25.454 --> 01:45:27.649
Then I don't believe in it no more.

1392
01:45:30.493 --> 01:45:34.862
Hell, now I just believe in the pictures
of old white men on green paper.


1393
01:45:34.897 --> 01:45:37.388
Well, that ain't no way to live.

1394
01:45:37.433 --> 01:45:39.697
You know, God don't like ugly, Bishop.

1395
01:45:39.735 --> 01:45:42.203
He ain't too fond of pretty, either.

1396
01:45:47.710 --> 01:45:50.110
Train, why you think...

1397
01:45:50.146 --> 01:45:54.242
Why you think God allow all this killin'
all over the world to happen?


1398
01:45:54.283 --> 01:45:56.410
- [distant explosion]
- Hmm?


1399
01:46:01.657 --> 01:46:03.989
See?

1400
01:46:04.026 --> 01:46:06.517
See, that's why I don't believe in him.

1401
01:46:10.266 --> 01:46:13.667
Well, if you don't believe in
him, Bishop Cummings, then...


1402
01:46:13.702 --> 01:46:17.695
...why you care about whether or not God
the one allowin' all the killin'?


1403
01:46:24.814 --> 01:46:26.372
Man...

1404
01:46:27.683 --> 01:46:30.015
Man, you startin' to sound
like my mama now.


1405
01:46:30.052 --> 01:46:31.542
[laughs]

1406
01:46:31.587 --> 01:46:33.953
Your mama alive, Bishop?

1407
01:46:33.989 --> 01:46:38.949
Train, mind your own goddamn business,
boy. You hear me?


1408
01:46:38.994 --> 01:46:42.555
Yeah, I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't, uh...


1409
01:46:42.598 --> 01:46:44.930
I didn't mean nothin'
by it, Bishop.


1410
01:46:44.967 --> 01:46:49.097
Is your God gonna get us
back home? In one piece?


1411
01:46:49.138 --> 01:46:52.107
Is he?

1412
01:46:53.843 --> 01:46:56.676
If the Lord is willin'
and the creek don't rise.


1413
01:47:02.151 --> 01:47:04.517
Hey, Renata.

1414
01:47:08.691 --> 01:47:12.718
- Where you headed?
- Your boss wants you.


1415
01:47:12.761 --> 01:47:16.492
Nah. Nah, no boss, OK?

1416
01:47:19.535 --> 01:47:21.765
Girl, let me trim your garden.

1417
01:47:24.607 --> 01:47:26.837
What do you mean?

1418
01:47:26.876 --> 01:47:30.277
<i>Signora, shakin' hands with you
is like touchin' a flamethrower.</i>


1419
01:47:32.047 --> 01:47:35.881
You fine as wine
and as silk as milk.

1420
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:45.120
You like dancin'? 
You like jazz?

1421
01:47:46.495 --> 01:47:50.454
- You ever heard of Count Basie?
- Count of Basie?


1422
01:47:52.301 --> 01:47:53.359
Where is this?

1423
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:56.635
Mm-hm.

1424
01:48:25.834 --> 01:48:28.064
Want a Camel cigarette?

1425
01:48:30.306 --> 01:48:31.739
[speaks Italian] Come in.

1426
01:49:16.018 --> 01:49:19.351
You didn't know that the Germans
raised the price on your head.


1427
01:49:19.388 --> 01:49:21.720
From 50,000 lire to 100,000 lire...

1428
01:49:21.757 --> 01:49:23.156
and a bag of salt.

1429
01:49:23.192 --> 01:49:24.591
Not bad!

1430
01:49:26.061 --> 01:49:30.828
But you saw, no one
from the village turned you in.


1431
01:49:32.067 --> 01:49:34.831
Not even
the Fascist Ludovico...


1432
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:38.101
who's so stingy he keeps his money
in his underpants.


1433
01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:39.266
Not even Ludovico?

1434
01:49:40.376 --> 01:49:41.604
Not even Ludovico.

1435
01:49:41.644 --> 01:49:43.441
If they only knew who I am,

1436
01:49:45.047 --> 01:49:46.844
what I've done,

1437
01:49:49.652 --> 01:49:51.813
they'd pull my heart out of my chest.

1438
01:49:52.521 --> 01:49:53.613
Peppi.

1439
01:49:56.358 --> 01:49:58.986
What's tormenting you so much?

1440
01:49:59.028 --> 01:50:01.155
We surprised a German Patrol...

1441
01:50:01.196 --> 01:50:04.097
[speaking German]
My little son Robert loves the rain.


1442
01:50:04.133 --> 01:50:06.067
My little Anna hates it.

1443
01:50:06.101 --> 01:50:07.500
Shut up you two!

1444
01:50:07.536 --> 01:50:08.594
Yes, Sir.

1445
01:50:17.312 --> 01:50:19.143
[in Italian] Where are you going?

1446
01:50:19.181 --> 01:50:20.648
Where are you going?

1447
01:50:23.719 --> 01:50:25.050
[screams]

1448
01:50:25.087 --> 01:50:26.179
I'll slaughter you.

1449
01:50:30.693 --> 01:50:32.160
Do you hear me?

1450
01:50:32.194 --> 01:50:34.287
Do you hear me?
I'll slaughter you.


1451
01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:40.159
How many times do you
want to kill him?


1452
01:50:41.704 --> 01:50:43.399
He's already dead.

1453
01:50:56.885 --> 01:50:58.580
Look what I found.

1454
01:50:59.455 --> 01:51:00.581
Here.

1455
01:51:00.622 --> 01:51:02.419
I'll keep this
for my family.


1456
01:51:02.458 --> 01:51:03.755
My daughter is hungry.

1457
01:51:03.792 --> 01:51:05.851
At least
I can give her food.


1458
01:51:05.894 --> 01:51:06.918
Take this.

1459
01:51:09.331 --> 01:51:11.390
This money is
stained with blood.


1460
01:51:12.568 --> 01:51:14.331
We're suppose
to catch the thieves...


1461
01:51:14.369 --> 01:51:15.996
not become them.

1462
01:51:16.038 --> 01:51:17.972
Let's not start a war
between ourselves.


1463
01:51:18.006 --> 01:51:20.600
What's that got to do with it?

1464
01:51:20.642 --> 01:51:22.234
I gave you
three years of blood.


1465
01:51:22.277 --> 01:51:23.505
To Italy and to him.

1466
01:51:23.545 --> 01:51:25.035
Three years of blood.

1467
01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:28.641
You're a Fascist and you'll
always be one, like Marco.


1468
01:51:28.684 --> 01:51:29.708
Here.

1469
01:51:29.752 --> 01:51:31.652
Take your money and go home.

1470
01:51:31.687 --> 01:51:33.587
I will take it home.

1471
01:51:36.692 --> 01:51:38.091
I will take it.

1472
01:51:38.827 --> 01:51:39.953
Go, go, go.

1473
01:51:39.995 --> 01:51:41.485
Go!

1474
01:51:54.777 --> 01:51:56.210
It's finished here.

1475
01:51:59.047 --> 01:52:01.379
You'll pay for this.

1476
01:52:03.786 --> 01:52:05.913
The Germans were blinded by rage.

1477
01:52:05.954 --> 01:52:08.718
We had been attacking
them for months. They were furious.


1478
01:52:09.758 --> 01:52:12.420
They combed the mountains
looking for us.


1479
01:52:12.461 --> 01:52:13.758
We had to hide.

1480
01:52:13.796 --> 01:52:15.127
We could have starved to death.

1481
01:52:22.471 --> 01:52:24.803
[in German] Nobody there.

1482
01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.933
[Peppi, in Italian]
A fellow Partisan saved us.


1483
01:52:26.975 --> 01:52:28.840
Paselli was her name.

1484
01:52:49.731 --> 01:52:52.598
She was the one who told me what
happened at St. Anna di Stazzema.


1485
01:52:53.535 --> 01:52:55.833
- Eat.
- Thank you.


1486
01:52:55.871 --> 01:52:57.736
I had sent the others to Serravezza.

1487
01:52:57.773 --> 01:53:00.867
I had to meet one of our men
who had gone to look for supplies.


1488
01:53:03.612 --> 01:53:05.978
But then, because of the storm,
I had to stay in the mountains.


1489
01:53:06.014 --> 01:53:08.744
They marched into St. Anna.

1490
01:53:08.784 --> 01:53:12.083
They gathered hundreds of people,

1491
01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:13.951
- women,
- children,


1492
01:53:13.989 --> 01:53:15.320
children and old people.

1493
01:53:18.193 --> 01:53:19.751
There were also refugees.

1494
01:53:19.795 --> 01:53:22.263
They grouped them in the Square.

1495
01:53:22.297 --> 01:53:23.696
In front of the Church.

1496
01:53:26.702 --> 01:53:28.795
[speaking Italian] One of you...

1497
01:53:30.706 --> 01:53:32.367
knows...

1498
01:53:32.407 --> 01:53:35.035
- where he is.
- [baby crying]


1499
01:53:36.078 --> 01:53:38.308
One of you...

1500
01:53:40.249 --> 01:53:41.910
has seen...

1501
01:53:41.950 --> 01:53:42.974
him.

1502
01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:45.844
So...

1503
01:53:47.823 --> 01:53:49.188
speak.

1504
01:53:53.128 --> 01:53:54.720
Everyone's quiet.

1505
01:53:59.835 --> 01:54:01.234
They don't know anything.

1506
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:02.567
They're innocent.

1507
01:54:02.604 --> 01:54:03.730
They don't know anything.

1508
01:54:03.772 --> 01:54:06.240
I gave you fifteen minutes...

1509
01:54:06.275 --> 01:54:07.708
They're innocent.

1510
01:54:07.743 --> 01:54:11.577
to find someone who would tell us...

1511
01:54:11.613 --> 01:54:12.978
They don't know.

1512
01:54:13.015 --> 01:54:16.178
where is the hideout of the Butterfly?

1513
01:54:16.218 --> 01:54:17.776
- They don't know.
- And his Bandits.


1514
01:54:17.819 --> 01:54:19.480
Take only my life.

1515
01:54:19.521 --> 01:54:20.613
I beg you.

1516
01:54:20.656 --> 01:54:23.523
You still have one minute.

1517
01:54:32.868 --> 01:54:33.892
Kneel.

1518
01:54:35.804 --> 01:54:37.999
In the name of the Father...

1519
01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:39.337
And the Son...

1520
01:54:39.374 --> 01:54:41.239
and the Holy Ghost.

1521
01:54:43.045 --> 01:54:45.673
[all] Our Father who art in Heaven,

1522
01:54:45.714 --> 01:54:48.239
hallowed be Thy name,

1523
01:54:48.283 --> 01:54:50.080
Thy Kingdom come,

1524
01:54:50.118 --> 01:54:52.279
Thy will be done,

1525
01:54:53.889 --> 01:54:55.254
On Earth...

1526
01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:57.758
as it is in Heaven.

1527
01:54:57.793 --> 01:55:01.092
- Give us this day our daily bread.
- [sobbing]


1528
01:55:01.129 --> 01:55:04.098
Forgive us for our trespasses,

1529
01:55:04.132 --> 01:55:06.600
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.


1530
01:55:07.502 --> 01:55:10.494
Lead us not into temptation.

1531
01:55:10.539 --> 01:55:12.632
But deliver us from Evil.

1532
01:55:13.375 --> 01:55:16.105
- Amen.
- Amen.


1533
01:55:16.144 --> 01:55:17.406
[speaking German] I understand.

1534
01:55:17.446 --> 01:55:19.380
- Is there something?
- Yes, Sir...


1535
01:55:19.414 --> 01:55:21.780
There are orders from headquarters.

1536
01:55:22.818 --> 01:55:23.842
Yes?

1537
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:26.845
It will be done.

1538
01:55:50.946 --> 01:55:52.004
[speaking Italian] Father.

1539
01:55:52.748 --> 01:55:54.045
Forgive them...

1540
01:55:54.082 --> 01:55:55.879
for they know not what they do.

1541
01:56:54.443 --> 01:56:55.637
[in Italian] They...

1542
01:56:55.677 --> 01:56:59.579
killed so many,

1543
01:57:01.016 --> 01:57:02.779
that they ran out of ammunition.

1544
01:57:24.372 --> 01:57:25.600
[crying stops]

1545
01:57:27.476 --> 01:57:29.034
[Peppi] They burnt so many...

1546
01:57:30.078 --> 01:57:33.138
[Paselli] they ran out of fuel.

1547
01:57:36.118 --> 01:57:38.211
[in Italian] What has happened here...

1548
01:57:40.989 --> 01:57:43.219
everything that's happened...

1549
01:57:44.559 --> 01:57:46.925
is your fault.

1550
01:57:46.962 --> 01:57:50.454
You promised to bring The Butterfly.

1551
01:57:50.499 --> 01:57:52.592
- He told me he would be here.
- No. No. I don't care!


1552
01:57:52.634 --> 01:57:54.329
- I know these people.
- You will pay for this!


1553
01:57:54.369 --> 01:57:56.200
They have nothing to do with it.

1554
01:57:56.238 --> 01:57:58.536
[Bergmann] Rodolfo, we had a deal.

1555
01:57:58.573 --> 01:58:00.370
[Rodolfo] No, I kept my deal.

1556
01:58:00.408 --> 01:58:02.069
I brought him here.

1557
01:58:02.110 --> 01:58:05.944
[Bergmann] But you promised me,
my dear Rodolfo.


1558
01:58:05.981 --> 01:58:07.539
You Italians don't know
how to keep a deal.


1559
01:58:07.582 --> 01:58:10.176
[Rodolfo] I betrayed my people.
I'll burn in Hell because of you.


1560
01:58:10.218 --> 01:58:13.654
[Bergmann] You worthless Italians.

1561
01:58:13.688 --> 01:58:15.622
You will pay for this!

1562
01:58:15.657 --> 01:58:17.352
All of you Italians will pay for this!

1563
01:58:17.392 --> 01:58:19.360
Mama!

1564
01:58:19.394 --> 01:58:20.520
Mama!

1565
01:58:20.562 --> 01:58:21.893
Mama!

1566
01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:23.557
[Hans] Arturo! Arturo!

1567
01:58:23.598 --> 01:58:24.826
No!

1568
01:58:24.866 --> 01:58:26.800
No! Stop! Stop!

1569
01:58:26.835 --> 01:58:28.063
Run! Run!

1570
01:58:28.103 --> 01:58:29.127
Run!

1571
01:58:29.171 --> 01:58:30.195
Run!

1572
01:58:31.406 --> 01:58:32.430
Child murderer!

1573
01:58:41.216 --> 01:58:42.706
[in German] Bloody traitor!

1574
01:58:44.419 --> 01:58:46.148
Come on!

1575
01:58:46.188 --> 01:58:47.519
Move!

1576
01:58:47.556 --> 01:58:48.955
Move! Move! Move!

1577
01:58:55.897 --> 01:58:57.364
Bring him back!

1578
01:58:59.034 --> 01:59:00.058
Go!

1579
01:59:07.576 --> 01:59:09.043
[Bergmann] Finish him!

1580
01:59:09.077 --> 01:59:10.567
Kill him!

1581
01:59:14.783 --> 01:59:16.910
[man] Move, move.
We can't go back without him.


1582
01:59:20.956 --> 01:59:22.218
[man 2] Where's that swine?

1583
01:59:22.257 --> 01:59:23.281
[man 3] Over there.

1584
01:59:30.765 --> 01:59:33.290
[Peppi, in Italian] Even if
I live a hundred years...


1585
01:59:33.335 --> 01:59:35.269
I've been dead from that day on.

1586
01:59:35.303 --> 01:59:36.702
Peppi.

1587
01:59:39.274 --> 01:59:42.004
You need a lot more courage
to live than to die.


1588
01:59:43.278 --> 01:59:46.213
But listen to me.

1589
01:59:46.248 --> 01:59:48.512
You have to accept the truth.

1590
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:51.519
Someone betrayed you.

1591
01:59:51.553 --> 01:59:54.750
And you have to find the traitor.

1592
01:59:56.825 --> 01:59:58.383
Only thing I know...

1593
02:00:00.362 --> 02:00:03.889
The Germans were wrong
to provoke The Sleeping Man.


1594
02:00:05.533 --> 02:00:07.296
Because, you'll see...

1595
02:00:07.335 --> 02:00:08.427
In the end,

1596
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:10.097
he'll protect us.

1597
02:00:11.206 --> 02:00:12.901
He'll protect his land.

1598
02:00:22.884 --> 02:00:24.442
[in Spanish] I'm done.

1599
02:00:26.021 --> 02:00:27.955
I shit on Hitler's mother.

1600
02:00:32.527 --> 02:00:36.623
If I were in San Juan,
I'd eat a good plate of rice and beans.


1601
02:00:36.665 --> 02:00:38.394
And a sweetie pie for dessert.

1602
02:00:42.370 --> 02:00:44.463
[muffled screams]

1603
02:00:54.115 --> 02:00:55.241
Who is he?

1604
02:00:56.451 --> 02:00:58.476
[speaking German]
I'll meet that swine...


1605
02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:01.181
in Hell.

1606
02:01:01.222 --> 02:01:02.621
I don't understand.

1607
02:01:07.896 --> 02:01:09.693
No, no, no. Come on.

1608
02:01:35.757 --> 02:01:37.782
[speaking Italian] Where's the German?

1609
02:01:37.826 --> 02:01:42.422
The Americans took him
and they kicked me out. I told you so.


1610
02:01:44.733 --> 02:01:47.531
We have to get
out of here right away.

1611
02:01:47.569 --> 02:01:50.800
It's full of Germans making their way
down The Sleeping Man.


1612
02:01:50.839 --> 02:01:52.568
The Germans have lost, everyone knows.

1613
02:01:52.607 --> 02:01:55.576
What are you talking about?
He who made the mistake must pay.


1614
02:01:55.610 --> 02:01:56.668
Rodolfo...

1615
02:01:56.711 --> 02:01:59.339
Ludovico's not the traitor anyway.

1616
02:02:00.482 --> 02:02:02.575
We'll find him. Trust me.

1617
02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:13.352
[laughs]

1618
02:02:13.395 --> 02:02:15.920
Do you remember the time...

1619
02:02:15.964 --> 02:02:18.228
when Marco spent the week
staring at the Mountain...


1620
02:02:18.266 --> 02:02:21.724
convinced that
The Sleeping Man would awaken?


1621
02:02:23.071 --> 02:02:25.096
And how my mother yelled at him!

1622
02:02:27.809 --> 02:02:29.367
Of course I remember.

1623
02:02:29.411 --> 02:02:30.901
Sleep. Sleep.

1624
02:02:32.614 --> 02:02:33.945
Marco's dead.

1625
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:37.441
I killed him.

1626
02:02:37.485 --> 02:02:40.010
In a firefight with
his Fascist comrades.


1627
02:02:40.054 --> 02:02:42.921
He would've done the same to me!

1628
02:02:42.957 --> 02:02:44.857
Because we're Partisans.

1629
02:02:46.694 --> 02:02:49.162
There's nothing left to see here.

1630
02:02:52.967 --> 02:02:54.457
Peppi...

1631
02:02:55.837 --> 02:02:59.898
Listen, if someone commits a sin...

1632
02:02:59.941 --> 02:03:01.772
a big sin...

1633
02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:07.880
and then he repents...

1634
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:09.983
and confesses.

1635
02:03:11.252 --> 02:03:13.516
do you think he'll go to Hell?

1636
02:03:15.089 --> 02:03:17.216
I don't know. I'm not a Priest.

1637
02:03:18.226 --> 02:03:19.784
What have you become?

1638
02:03:20.662 --> 02:03:22.254
I don't recognize you anymore.

1639
02:03:22.297 --> 02:03:25.232
You are here rationalizing.

1640
02:03:25.266 --> 02:03:29.066
Always talking about my dead brother.
What do you want from me?


1641
02:03:30.705 --> 02:03:33.503
Do you want to know
who betrayed you at St. Anna?


1642
02:03:33.541 --> 02:03:36.305
We should have kept the German
instead of giving him to the Americans.


1643
02:03:36.344 --> 02:03:38.812
Maybe we'd have discovered
that he can speak Italian.


1644
02:03:38.847 --> 02:03:40.747
Maybe he would have spoke of you.

1645
02:03:44.719 --> 02:03:48.052
We've known each other a lifetime,
and you think it was me?


1646
02:03:48.089 --> 02:03:50.489
This is war, Peppi.

1647
02:03:50.525 --> 02:03:53.016
And in war people suffer; people die!

1648
02:03:53.061 --> 02:03:56.497
So, do you think the people at St. Anna
had to die because this is war?


1649
02:03:57.565 --> 02:03:59.192
I didn't say that!

1650
02:03:59.234 --> 02:04:00.531
I trusted you.

1651
02:04:00.568 --> 02:04:04.527
It was you that I had
to meet to get supplies.


1652
02:04:04.572 --> 02:04:08.064
It was you who suggested
St. Anna was a safe place.


1653
02:04:08.109 --> 02:04:09.804
What did you want to do?

1654
02:04:11.079 --> 02:04:12.740
Did you want revenge
because I killed your brother?


1655
02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:14.247
For the last time...

1656
02:04:14.282 --> 02:04:15.715
You should've told me,
then I would have let them only kill me.


1657
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:17.718
Stop talking about my dead brother.

1658
02:04:17.752 --> 02:04:19.913
You killed him!

1659
02:04:19.954 --> 02:04:22.980
Hundreds of innocent people.

1660
02:04:23.024 --> 02:04:24.616
You sent me to Hell...

1661
02:04:48.583 --> 02:04:49.948
[in Italian] Bastard!

1662
02:04:49.984 --> 02:04:51.144
Bastard!

1663
02:05:00.595 --> 02:05:02.028
Stamps!

1664
02:05:02.864 --> 02:05:04.456
Stamps!

1665
02:05:05.833 --> 02:05:08.495
- We got problems.
- Where you been?


1666
02:05:08.536 --> 02:05:09.628
Where's the Jerry?

1667
02:05:09.671 --> 02:05:11.332
That son of a bitch
Rodolfo slit his throat.


1668
02:05:11.372 --> 02:05:13.203
Then he killed Peppi.

1669
02:05:13.241 --> 02:05:15.801
- What happened to your neck?
- He tried to kill me.


1670
02:05:15.843 --> 02:05:18.641
- He was no good.
- Roll before the heavy mail comes.


1671
02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:21.148
Go get a bandage. 
Go get your radio.

1672
02:05:24.619 --> 02:05:26.985
Bishop! Where's your weapon?

1673
02:05:28.957 --> 02:05:30.390
I'm here.

1674
02:05:31.926 --> 02:05:34.224
- Where's Siegfried?
- The Italian killed him.


1675
02:05:34.262 --> 02:05:35.456
No shit?

1676
02:05:37.765 --> 02:05:39.392
Nokes still comin', ain't he?

1677
02:05:39.434 --> 02:05:42.562
Get your gear, get to
Old Man Loody's house on the double.


1678
02:05:42.604 --> 02:05:45.232
Hadn't sent that doofus over,
we wouldn't be here.


1679
02:05:45.273 --> 02:05:47.833
I ain't send that dense
nigga no place. Bullshit.


1680
02:05:47.875 --> 02:05:51.504
What you done is worse.
Beat the man out of the 1,400 chips.


1681
02:06:41.963 --> 02:06:45.330
That tight pussy was on its own
so long it needed to be adopted.


1682
02:06:45.366 --> 02:06:46.663
Talk!

1683
02:06:58.146 --> 02:06:59.511
I'll kill you!

1684
02:07:08.122 --> 02:07:12.024
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll make you swallow that gold tooth!


1685
02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:13.857
- Hey! Get off him!
- What?


1686
02:07:13.895 --> 02:07:17.558
I said get off! 
Nokes is here!

1687
02:07:17.598 --> 02:07:20.658
- Nokes is here!
- Get off me!


1688
02:07:20.702 --> 02:07:22.795
Kill yourselves on your own time.

1689
02:07:49.530 --> 02:07:52.624
Hey, boys. Which one of you's Stamps?

1690
02:07:52.667 --> 02:07:55.500
- Sir.
- Did ya get that goddamn Kraut fucker?


1691
02:07:55.536 --> 02:07:58.096
- Captain...
- I don't wanna hear shit other than


1692
02:07:58.139 --> 02:08:02.542
how the fuck you ended up miles on
the wrong side of this goddamn valley.


1693
02:08:02.577 --> 02:08:04.602
Kraut's around the corner there.

1694
02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:08.375
Birdsong, find out what his problem is

1695
02:08:08.416 --> 02:08:10.543
while I go get the goose-stepper.

1696
02:08:10.585 --> 02:08:13.748
Stamps, you got two minutes
to get your balls out of a sling.


1697
02:08:16.124 --> 02:08:20.083
- Get rid of that kid.
- I've been trying to, sir.


1698
02:08:20.128 --> 02:08:23.791
But I guess he don't wanna let me go.
He's a nice little fella.


1699
02:08:23.831 --> 02:08:27.426
- Ain't he cute?
- I said get rid of him.


1700
02:08:27.468 --> 02:08:32.496
I don't know what to do with him, sir.
I ain't gonna leave him.


1701
02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:35.008
So I figure to take him along.

1702
02:08:35.042 --> 02:08:39.741
He don't talk much, but he do tap.
See here? Watch this here.


1703
02:08:39.781 --> 02:08:43.182
- I do this, and then...
- What the fuck is wrong with you?


1704
02:08:43.217 --> 02:08:46.118
Spent two days risking
our asses gettin' here for you.


1705
02:08:46.154 --> 02:08:49.681
It's good men, white men in this man's
army holding back that attack,


1706
02:08:49.724 --> 02:08:52.557
and you gonna talk to me
about some damn dago wop kid?


1707
02:08:55.263 --> 02:08:58.755
- I feel sorry for him, sir.
- You feel sorry for him?


1708
02:09:00.234 --> 02:09:02.725
OK.

1709
02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:10.404
OK, button up, get in the Jeep,
and let's get the fuck out of here.


1710
02:09:12.213 --> 02:09:15.671
Ain't no cause for that kind of talk
in front of no child, sir.


1711
02:09:15.716 --> 02:09:18.651
You ain't got to
make him cry now, sir.

1712
02:09:18.686 --> 02:09:20.551
- No.
- Cool it, Diesel.


1713
02:09:20.588 --> 02:09:23.079
Nobody gonna talk to my boy like that.

1714
02:09:23.124 --> 02:09:27.220
Cussin' and thumpin' and yellin'
and carryin' on. Spittin'.


1715
02:09:27.261 --> 02:09:30.924
- Easy, big fella.
- He's a child, sir.


1716
02:09:30.965 --> 02:09:35.629
Sir. Sir. Train got
a mind of his own.

1717
02:09:35.670 --> 02:09:39.970
It was my idea to bring the kid.
We got him down at the Serchio River.


1718
02:09:40.007 --> 02:09:44.205
The fact is the kid won't leave us.
I told Train to take him.


1719
02:09:44.245 --> 02:09:46.179
Mm-hm.

1720
02:09:47.515 --> 02:09:49.244
You handle your men.

1721
02:09:50.751 --> 02:09:52.378
Move.

1722
02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:55.617
- Captain Nokes got a filthy mouth.
- Come here.


1723
02:09:56.757 --> 02:09:59.157
- Renata.
- Come here! Train.


1724
02:09:59.193 --> 02:10:02.094
Give the kid to Loosey-Goosey.
She'll do a fine job.


1725
02:10:02.129 --> 02:10:05.155
- She ain't his mama.
- I know, but you gotta give him up.


1726
02:10:05.199 --> 02:10:09.363
She don't know him good as I do. I got a
granny back home who'll raise him right.


1727
02:10:09.403 --> 02:10:13.032
- Train, give him to me. Please.
- Sarge.


1728
02:10:14.141 --> 02:10:15.608
[in Italian] Come here. Come to me.

1729
02:10:15.643 --> 02:10:17.804
- He don't wanna go.
- [Renata] Come to me, please.


1730
02:10:17.845 --> 02:10:20.643
This some kind of fuckin' minstrel show?

1731
02:10:28.022 --> 02:10:30.286
Move! Get out of my goddamn way!

1732
02:10:30.324 --> 02:10:34.192
Get out of my goddamn way! Move!

1733
02:10:38.199 --> 02:10:41.532
This Kraut fucker's dead!
From the crew cut down.


1734
02:10:41.569 --> 02:10:43.298
How did he get that way?

1735
02:10:45.539 --> 02:10:47.564
I guess somebody killed him, sir.

1736
02:10:47.608 --> 02:10:51.442
I can see that, Staff Sergeant Stamps.
But how did he get killed?


1737
02:10:51.479 --> 02:10:53.743
- Didn't you put a man on him?
- I did.


1738
02:10:53.781 --> 02:10:56.215
- The Partisan killed him.
- Dropped the ball!


1739
02:10:56.250 --> 02:11:00.846
You dropped the fuckin' ball!
You fucked up big time.


1740
02:11:00.888 --> 02:11:03.721
Now, all four of you
gonna be court-martialed.


1741
02:11:03.758 --> 02:11:06.989
One, two, three and four.

1742
02:11:07.028 --> 02:11:09.895
Sir, we gotta pull out now.

1743
02:11:10.831 --> 02:11:12.958
Now, you load up, soldier.

1744
02:11:15.169 --> 02:11:18.502
About this child? If I could
just get a word with you about...


1745
02:11:18.539 --> 02:11:23.374
For the last time, soldier. I told you
to get in that goddamn Jeep.


1746
02:11:23.411 --> 02:11:25.811
Ain't no need to shoot
the man over no child.


1747
02:11:25.846 --> 02:11:28.144
We can take him to headquarters.
We got room.


1748
02:11:28.182 --> 02:11:30.742
Yeah. Ain't no trouble.
We can take the kid.


1749
02:11:30.785 --> 02:11:34.687
Lieutenant Birdsong,
you take that goddamn kid.


1750
02:11:34.722 --> 02:11:37.987
- Huh?
- You heard me.


1751
02:11:40.027 --> 02:11:42.291
Don't make it tough on me,
big fella.


1752
02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:45.265
You better not
come no closer.


1753
02:11:47.301 --> 02:11:48.700
Wouldn't do that, sir.

1754
02:11:50.571 --> 02:11:52.766
- [Bishop] Choke him, Train!
- Train, for God's sake!


1755
02:11:54.375 --> 02:11:57.003
- [Bishop] Choke that tar.
- [Hector] Put him down.


1756
02:11:57.044 --> 02:11:58.568
[Nokes] Soldier, put him down!

1757
02:11:58.612 --> 02:12:00.637
[Hector] He's had enough.
Put him down.


1758
02:12:00.681 --> 02:12:02.672
[Bishop] Choke the shit
out of that fucker!


1759
02:12:02.717 --> 02:12:04.776
[Nokes] Put him down right this second!

1760
02:12:04.819 --> 02:12:07.185
[Angelo, in Italian] Chocolate Giant!

1761
02:12:07.221 --> 02:12:08.779
The Sleeping Man.

1762
02:12:08.823 --> 02:12:12.384
- Diesel, you're killing 'im.
- Put him down!


1763
02:12:12.426 --> 02:12:13.825
[Bishop] Leave him be, Stamps.

1764
02:12:13.861 --> 02:12:15.226
[Nokes] That's right, big fella.

1765
02:12:15.262 --> 02:12:18.720
- Birdsong! Son, you OK?
- Crazy black bastard!


1766
02:12:18.766 --> 02:12:20.563
- Come here.
- Help me get him.


1767
02:12:20.601 --> 02:12:22.193
[in Italian] Get back. Get back.

1768
02:12:22.236 --> 02:12:23.760
Let me take him.

1769
02:12:24.972 --> 02:12:28.169
- I'll see you again, Stamps.
- I hope so.


1770
02:12:31.479 --> 02:12:33.470
- Come on!
- Let's move out! Let's go!


1771
02:12:36.450 --> 02:12:37.883
Come on. Let's move out.

1772
02:12:41.389 --> 02:12:42.913

Hector! Go get Ludovico! Go!

1779
02:13:33.174 --> 02:13:34.607

02:13:40.714 --> 02:13:41.738

Forward. Be alert.

Jesus Lord, Bishop,
I can't move my head.


1794
02:15:13.374 --> 02:15:15.501
- Is my boy livin'?
- Yeah.


1795
02:15:15.543 --> 02:15:16.874
Is he livin'?

1796
02:15:16.911 --> 02:15:19.505
He just got a little scratch,
but he gonna be OK.


1797
02:15:19.547 --> 02:15:21.981
That's good. That's good.

1798
02:15:24.718 --> 02:15:27.243
Tell Hector to put that
little old cross on him.


1799
02:15:27.288 --> 02:15:30.655
- Let him know who his daddy is.
- OK.

Uh-huh. You seen it the whole time,

I knew it. I knew it...

1803
02:15:55.683 --> 02:15:59.483
Train, I'm gonna take this kid,
and I'm gonna come back for you.

This was our time to be children.

1856
02:21:35.489 --> 02:21:36.513
[in Italian] Come here.

1857
02:22:15.195 --> 02:22:16.662
[in German] Prepare to die.

1858
02:22:18.131 --> 02:22:19.621
This is over.

1859
02:22:19.666 --> 02:22:21.395
Gather the wounded...

1860
02:22:21.435 --> 02:22:22.834
and bury our dead.

1861
02:22:22.869 --> 02:22:24.666
Let's go.

1862
02:22:24.705 --> 02:22:26.332
Let's go.

1863
02:22:26.373 --> 02:22:27.431
Let's go.

1864
02:22:41.588 --> 02:22:43.146
Defend yourself.

1865
02:23:12.686 --> 02:23:16.087
- Medic! We need you right now!
- Right here.


1866
02:23:16.123 --> 02:23:17.613
Guys, we need a hand.

1867
02:23:22.629 --> 02:23:25.063
Stand by. Lift!

1868
02:23:37.310 --> 02:23:40.143
[man] Easy, y'all. Real easy.

1869
02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:44.344
It's gonna be OK, Hector. You're going
back home to New York, man.


1870
02:23:52.759 --> 02:23:55.023
[man 2] Reconnaissance photos
were accurate.


1871
02:23:55.062 --> 02:23:58.122
General Almond wouldn't listen.
Go get those dog tags.


1872
02:23:58.165 --> 02:23:59.462
[man 3] Yes, sir.

1873
02:23:59.499 --> 02:24:01.694
[man 2] I need a full report,
on the double.


1874
02:24:03.236 --> 02:24:05.796
- [man 3] "Stamps, Aubrey."
- [man 4] Got it.


1875
02:24:07.808 --> 02:24:10.504
- [man 3] "Cummings, Bishop."
- [man 4] Check.


1876
02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:16.048
- [man 3] "Train, Samuel."
- [man 4] Got it.


1877
02:24:23.457 --> 02:24:26.551
Well done, corporal.
You earned yourself a Purple Heart.


1878
02:24:26.593 --> 02:24:29.027
- Get this man to the aid station.
- Yes, sir!


1879
02:24:29.062 --> 02:24:30.586
Detail.

1880
02:24:38.371 --> 02:24:41.306
[Tim] Come on, Mr. Negron.
You're clean as a board of health.


1881
02:24:41.341 --> 02:24:46.870
You got no kids, no debts. No enemies.
Four years in the service. Purple Heart.


1882
02:24:46.913 --> 02:24:52.044
Why stick a German Luger in a guy's
chest three months short of retirement?


1883
02:24:53.253 --> 02:24:55.585
You're looking at 25 to life, pal.

1884
02:25:08.301 --> 02:25:10.929
<i>[woman] State v. 
Hector Negron.</i>

1885
02:25:10.971 --> 02:25:16.375
Case 14, dockets 79A and 34B.

1886
02:25:16.409 --> 02:25:20.539
Judge Trinkoff presiding. All rise.

1887
02:25:22.516 --> 02:25:27.249
Peter Hammond, District Attorney,
representing People, State of New York.


1888
02:25:27.287 --> 02:25:30.279
Michael Decker, legal aid for defense.

1889
02:25:31.224 --> 02:25:33.249
It's Zana Wilder.

1890
02:25:33.293 --> 02:25:35.591
Michael, let me handle this.

1891
02:25:35.629 --> 02:25:39.998
Legal aid will be withdrawing. Miss
Wilder will be counsel for defense.


1892
02:25:40.033 --> 02:25:41.625
Say nothing, do nothing.

1893
02:25:41.668 --> 02:25:44.228
Your Honor, we ask
that bail be set at two million.


1894
02:25:44.271 --> 02:25:46.705
Defendant murdered a man in cold blood.

1895
02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:50.642
Also, he was in possession of a famous
missing artifact stolen from Italy.


1896
02:25:50.677 --> 02:25:54.238
The old stolen statue head case.
Whatever happened with that?


1897
02:25:54.281 --> 02:25:56.442
The victim is dead, Your Honor.

1898
02:25:56.483 --> 02:26:01.477
Rudolph Tringali, from St. Anna di...
something or other, in Italy.


1899
02:26:01.521 --> 02:26:04.615
Immigrant textile worker,
lived in the Bronx.


1900
02:26:04.658 --> 02:26:06.853
Not him. The statue head.

1901
02:26:06.893 --> 02:26:10.556
[Hammond] Oh, that was returned
to Florence, Italy, Your Honor.


1902
02:26:10.597 --> 02:26:14.727
Proposed bail at two million.
Defense?


1903
02:26:14.768 --> 02:26:16.497
Defendant will post cash bail.

1904
02:26:20.006 --> 02:26:24.875
- Miss Wilder, approach the bench.
- Yes, Your Honor.


1905
02:26:28.515 --> 02:26:32.952
What are you doing here?
Exxon buying the U.S. Postal Service?


1906
02:26:32.986 --> 02:26:37.116
It's a Christmas pro bono case.
Picked it out of a hat.


1907
02:26:37.157 --> 02:26:39.955
My ass. I smell a rat.

1908
02:26:41.161 --> 02:26:42.788
If you expect to get appointed

1909
02:26:42.829 --> 02:26:45.093
to the appellate court next year,

1910
02:26:45.131 --> 02:26:47.691
I suggest you cover your nose.

1911
02:26:53.874 --> 02:26:57.571
Bail set at two million. Next case.

1912
02:27:01.681 --> 02:27:05.344
- Can I ask you a question, miss?
- Anything you wish, Mr. Negron.


1913
02:27:05.385 --> 02:27:08.354
- Who are you?
- A friend of a friend.


1914
02:27:08.388 --> 02:27:11.789
- Jennifer, let's go.
- Right behind you.


1915
02:27:12.893 --> 02:27:14.554
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.


1916
02:27:16.963 --> 02:27:20.660
Mr. Negron. Mr. Negron,
who's the Sleeping Man?


1917
02:27:24.104 --> 02:27:26.334
Who is he? Mr. Negron?

1918
02:27:28.675 --> 02:27:30.666
Who's the Sleeping Man?

1919
02:28:04.544 --> 02:28:08.878
- Where are we?
- Rose Island, Nassau, Bahamas.


1920
02:28:08.915 --> 02:28:12.612
- You have a friend who wants to meet.
- No.


1921
02:28:12.652 --> 02:28:16.748
- All my true friends are dead.
- Not this one.


1922
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:19.452
Your friend has learned
there is no control in life.


1923
02:28:19.492 --> 02:28:22.222
Wherever you go, wherever
you hide, there's risk.


1924
02:28:22.262 --> 02:28:25.356
Your friend understood,
turned knowledge into invention:


1925
02:28:25.398 --> 02:28:30.995
Seat belts, safety devices and so forth.
And your friend made a fortune.


1926
02:28:31.037 --> 02:28:34.529
People pay for control,
even if they have none.


1927
02:28:34.574 --> 02:28:36.769
Safety is the greatest risk of all,

1928
02:28:36.810 --> 02:28:39.506
'cause safety leaves
no room for miracles.


1929
02:28:39.546 --> 02:28:42.811
And miracles are the only
sure thing in life.


1930
02:28:42.849 --> 02:28:46.979
Mister, you talk crazy.
Now, I don't want a miracle.


1931
02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:50.751
I just wanna join my wife,
Lourdes, in the glory of heaven.


1932
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:52.758
Is that too much to ask for?

1933
02:29:47.147 --> 02:29:49.274
I was the only one left.

1934
02:29:51.117 --> 02:29:53.779
I'm the only one left who knows.

1935
02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:57.017
- I'm the last.
- You're not the last.


1936
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:19.144
There was a little boy.

1937
02:30:20.713 --> 02:30:23.079
- It is I.
- Angelo?


1938
02:30:23.116 --> 02:30:24.549
Angelo!

1939
02:30:32.859 --> 02:30:34.451
Angelo.

1940
02:30:38.465 --> 02:30:40.296
Angelo.

1941
02:30:45.271 --> 02:30:47.330
Angelo.
