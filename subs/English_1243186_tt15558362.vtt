1
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.944
You're leaving already?

2
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:37.246
I haven't even
made us breakfast yet.


3
00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.648
Oh, I'm sorry, rabbit.

4
00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:40.550
I got a lot
to take care of today.


5
00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:44.386
How much longer are we
gonna have to keep doing this?


6
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:47.557
You said you wanted
to be with me and only me.


7
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:50.794
I do, but it's not that easy

8
00:02:50.927 --> 00:02:53.395
Baby, this is so unfair.

9
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.365
I know. You know, but it
won't be like this forever.


10
00:03:01.303 --> 00:03:02.672
Okay.

11
00:03:02.806 --> 00:03:05.075
Can you stay wearing that
'til I get back?


12
00:03:05.207 --> 00:03:06.976
Mm-hmm. I'll be waiting.

13
00:03:12.148 --> 00:03:13.382
Oh, my gosh.

14
00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:29.431
- Hey.
- Hey.


15
00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:31.034
How was your flight?

16
00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:32.702
Uh, it was good.

17
00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:33.970
A little turbulence,
but, uh, freaked me out a bit,


18
00:03:34.104 --> 00:03:35.138
but it's all good now.

19
00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:36.906
So, I'm gonna go to Alan's.

20
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.775
He asked me to help him with
some stuff around the house.


21
00:03:38.908 --> 00:03:41.745
Okay. I'm going to go
shopping this afternoon, so.


22
00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:43.546
Okay. Well, just be here
at 6:00.


23
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.981
Reservation is at 8:30, okay?

24
00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:46.515
Oh, if you see Lydia,

25
00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.151
please tell her not
to overdress tonight.


26
00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:50.220
Every time she does,
I feel like a complete slob.


27
00:03:50.352 --> 00:03:53.790
Sweetie, you can never look
like a slob, even if you tried.


28
00:03:57.961 --> 00:04:01.197
Hey, tell me what you think.
Does this go with that?


29
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.632
No.

30
00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:06.435
Oh, I know the perfect one.

31
00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.306
Yes, that's it.

32
00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:14.210
So, did your boy toy
come over last night?


33
00:04:14.844 --> 00:04:17.513
Honey, he is so much more
than a boy toy.


34
00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:18.982
You sure about that?

35
00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:20.750
Because he mainly
comes over at night.


36
00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:23.318
Well, that is because
the sex is incredible


37
00:04:23.452 --> 00:04:25.255
And not because
he's hiding from his wife?


38
00:04:25.387 --> 00:04:27.090
Okay. There's that too.

39
00:04:28.357 --> 00:04:29.592
You are the only one

40
00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:30.994
that I can talk
to about this stuff.


41
00:04:31.127 --> 00:04:33.530
Thank you for not judging me.

42
00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:35.297
Oh, girl,
all your skeletons are hidden


43
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.566
in the depths of my soul.

44
00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.334
No, but seriously.

45
00:04:39.468 --> 00:04:41.037
It's not like
I wanna be a homewrecker


46
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:43.706
or a husband stealer,
or whatever you call it.


47
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.675
The other woman. I mean,
that's what you call it.


48
00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.177
At least,
that's my term of reference.


49
00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:48.578
It's a little more discreet.

50
00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:50.713
I fell in love
with a married man.


51
00:04:50.847 --> 00:04:52.816
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God!


52
00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.884
That sounds terrible
when you say it out loud.


53
00:04:55.018 --> 00:04:56.085
What's her name?

54
00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.856
Ugh. Celine. Celine Castillo.

55
00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:03.726
-This one?
-Mm-hmm.


56
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.994
Girl, she's flan

57
00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:07.030
and you're....

58
00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:11.935
Seriously,
you tell anyone, kick your ass.


59
00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:13.236
Never talk to you again.

60
00:05:13.368 --> 00:05:14.871
I ain't gonna be
no snitch, man.


61
00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:19.108
I ain't saying a word.
That good in bed, huh?


62
00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:20.944
Like you wouldn't believe, man.

63
00:05:21.077 --> 00:05:24.413
Yo, you wouldn't leave Celine
for this girl, right?


64
00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:26.316
No. No. I-
- I-
- I love Celine,

65
00:05:26.448 --> 00:05:30.153
but, uh, I think
I'm falling for this girl.


66
00:05:30.753 --> 00:05:34.057
Things are just getting
so intense.


67
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.892
I don't know how to stop it.

68
00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:38.360
And to be honest, I--
I don't know if I want it to.


69
00:05:38.493 --> 00:05:41.331
Yo, when you get caught,

70
00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:43.066
don't come crying to me.

71
00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.201
Shut up. I don't even want
to think about that, all right?


72
00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:46.903
All right, bro.

73
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.405
I love the dress.

74
00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:54.310
I can't wait
to wear it tonight.


75
00:05:54.443 --> 00:05:55.778
You like it?

76
00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:00.550
All right.
Well, I'm out of here.


77
00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:02.919
-Where you going?
-To buy my wife a dress.


78
00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:14.764
I would
like to propose to toast.


79
00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:17.533
- Yeah.
- To our beautiful wives


80
00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.236
for choosing us lucky bastards.

81
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.607
That's sweet.

82
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:26.142
<i>-Salud.</i>
<i>-Salud.</i>


83
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:30.613
So, what's new with you?

84
00:06:30.747 --> 00:06:34.449
So, I have
an ovulation calendar


85
00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:35.752
and reminder set on my phone.

86
00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:37.687
I mean, we're going for it.

87
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.723
Like, we're really trying
the old-fashioned way first.


88
00:06:40.857 --> 00:06:43.092
And if that doesn't work,
I'll look into IVF.


89
00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:45.328
I think he's gonna be
a great father.


90
00:06:45.862 --> 00:06:48.164
Yeah.

91
00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:53.002
Yeah, I don't know if we--

92
00:06:53.136 --> 00:06:54.570
Like 15 times.

93
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:57.707
She's wearing my dress.

94
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.944
Don't worry about it.
You're wearing it better.


95
00:07:07.884 --> 00:07:09.451
Can I get you started
with some drinks?


96
00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:12.355
Yes. I will have
a tall glass of Chardonnay.


97
00:07:12.487 --> 00:07:13.756
Okay.

98
00:07:20.663 --> 00:07:26.970
Oh, my God! Baby!
It's perfect. I love it.


99
00:07:27.103 --> 00:07:29.339
I can't wait to wear it.

100
00:07:29.504 --> 00:07:30.807
Well, I saw that dress

101
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.342
and I immediately
thought of you.


102
00:07:32.474 --> 00:07:34.077
It belongs on these curves.

103
00:07:37.413 --> 00:07:39.449
Um, I'll be right back.

104
00:07:39.582 --> 00:07:40.650
I'm gonna head to the restroom.

105
00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:42.018
I'll go with you.

106
00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:52.996
You know what, 
I'm actually--

107
00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:54.731
I'm gonna freshen up really
quick. I'll be right back.


108
00:07:54.864 --> 00:07:56.532
-Take your time.
-Thank you.


109
00:08:07.043 --> 00:08:08.678
Caleb!

110
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.281
You're on a date?

111
00:08:12.415 --> 00:08:14.183
Are you kidding me right now?

112
00:08:14.317 --> 00:08:16.085
You are literally wining
and dining with your wife.


113
00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:18.287
-Shh!
-What am I supposed to do?


114
00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:21.357
You want me to just
sit at home waiting for you?


115
00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:25.161
You know what, Caleb?
You can fix her up like me,


116
00:08:25.294 --> 00:08:26.596
you can dress her like me,

117
00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:29.132
but she's never
gonna fuck you like I do


118
00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:31.501
because that's all
I am to you, isn't it?


119
00:08:31.634 --> 00:08:32.902
I'm just a good fuck.

120
00:08:33.036 --> 00:08:35.104
No, Fiona. I love you, okay?

121
00:08:35.772 --> 00:08:37.407
You love me?

122
00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:39.675
Well then,
I'm gonna go tell her.


123
00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.177
No, no. Do not
cause a scene like this.


124
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:42.979
Not like this. Please.

125
00:08:43.846 --> 00:08:45.415
Do you wanna
leave your wife or not?


126
00:08:45.548 --> 00:08:46.949
It's really so simple.

127
00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.851
But if you keep
lying to me, Caleb,


128
00:08:48.985 --> 00:08:51.587
I swear, I will
make your life miserable.


129
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.125
Just not tonight, please,
all right?


130
00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:58.928
Please, please
don't say anything.


131
00:09:00.163 --> 00:09:01.964
Just go.

132
00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:12.275
Tonight was fun.
I think we needed that.


133
00:09:12.408 --> 00:09:14.610
Ah, I had so much fun.

134
00:09:16.145 --> 00:09:17.814
We need to do
date nights more often.


135
00:09:17.947 --> 00:09:20.283
Hm. Like we used to?

136
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.420
Yeah. You looked
so beautiful tonight.


137
00:09:24.555 --> 00:09:27.156
Mm-hmm. What about now?

138
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.357
Extremely.

139
00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:03.159
You wouldn't text me back
and I just had to come see you.


140
00:10:04.026 --> 00:10:05.628
Well, guess what?

141
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:08.097
She's gonna be outta town
for the next few days and--


142
00:10:08.231 --> 00:10:09.533
- Unbelievable.
- Fiona.


143
00:10:09.665 --> 00:10:11.134
Look, I know you think

144
00:10:11.267 --> 00:10:13.069
you're getting the short end
of the stick here.


145
00:10:13.202 --> 00:10:15.171
You're right. I am getting
the short end of the stick.


146
00:10:15.304 --> 00:10:18.040
You're just stringing me along
and you know it.


147
00:10:19.408 --> 00:10:20.611
No, we're done, Caleb.

148
00:10:20.743 --> 00:10:21.811
No. Come here. Come here.

149
00:10:21.944 --> 00:10:23.045
-Fiona, come here.
-No.


150
00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:24.647
This is
the honest to God truth.


151
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.617
I am in love with you

152
00:10:26.749 --> 00:10:29.218
and I don't wanna lose you,
all right?


153
00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:30.820
Look, give me two months

154
00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:32.455
to do what I gotta do
and take care of


155
00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:34.724
what I gotta take care of
and I will leave her.


156
00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:39.195
I wanna start a life with you.
And I mean that, Fiona.


157
00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:45.101
Two months.

158
00:10:45.234 --> 00:10:47.036
Two months.

159
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.074
I don't know why,

160
00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:56.112
but I think
you're for real this time.


161
00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:57.113
I am.

162
00:10:57.246 --> 00:10:59.182
Just don't let me down, Caleb.

163
00:10:59.315 --> 00:11:00.816
I promise I won't.

164
00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:06.822
Oh, my God, baby.
This is the best news ever.


165
00:11:07.524 --> 00:11:09.158
But if you're lying to me,

166
00:11:10.459 --> 00:11:12.995
I swear I will never
speak to you again.


167
00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:14.697
Honest to God truth.

168
00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:18.968
And for the record,

169
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:20.469
I was so jealous
of your date that night.


170
00:11:20.604 --> 00:11:21.737
I wanted to kill him.

171
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:23.139
Oh, is that so?

172
00:11:23.272 --> 00:11:24.840
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, don't worry.


173
00:11:24.974 --> 00:11:26.709
I didn't fuck him
in my new dress.


174
00:11:26.842 --> 00:11:28.511
You better not have

175
00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:29.912
I took it off first.

176
00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:32.014
-Oh, I probably deserve that.
-Mm-hmm.


177
00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:34.050
And you deserve this.
I'm gonna tickle you now.


178
00:11:34.183 --> 00:11:35.586
Come here. Get over here.

179
00:11:35.718 --> 00:11:37.086
Stop it!
No! You know I hate that.


180
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.822
Stop! Baby, please.
I'm gonna kick your ass.


181
00:11:43.092 --> 00:11:45.461
I'm letting you know
I hate that.


182
00:11:45.596 --> 00:11:47.096
I know.

183
00:11:49.332 --> 00:11:50.399
Come get me.

184
00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:35.111
All right,
we're gonna have some fun.


185
00:12:35.244 --> 00:12:36.846
We're gonna have some wine,
some cheese.


186
00:12:36.979 --> 00:12:38.548
-Some carrots.
-Some carrots.


187
00:12:38.682 --> 00:12:40.916
We're gonna have some carrots
for your bad eyesight.


188
00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:45.054
They can't be that bad.
I chose you.


189
00:12:45.187 --> 00:12:47.490
That's true. Actually,
you have great eyesight.


190
00:12:48.592 --> 00:12:50.993
All right, let's do this.

191
00:12:53.296 --> 00:12:56.465
So does my rabbit, uh,
have her carrots for the day?


192
00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:59.869
You'll always tease me
about eating them.


193
00:13:00.002 --> 00:13:01.370
Well, besides the obvious,

194
00:13:01.504 --> 00:13:03.039
there's a second reason
why I call you that.


195
00:13:03.172 --> 00:13:04.874
Oh? You don't even
know the real reason


196
00:13:05.007 --> 00:13:06.042
why I eat them so much.

197
00:13:06.175 --> 00:13:07.577
Duh.

198
00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:10.980
No, dummy.
For the beta carotene.


199
00:13:11.113 --> 00:13:12.815
'Cause if I have
at least two a day,


200
00:13:12.948 --> 00:13:14.751
it makes my skin a glow.

201
00:13:14.884 --> 00:13:17.688
See? Look. Don't I have a glow?

202
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.123
Your skin is glowing
and your eyes are beaming


203
00:13:21.257 --> 00:13:23.694
just so beautifully right now.

204
00:13:23.826 --> 00:13:25.729
You know, it's the first thing
I noticed about you, right?


205
00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:29.566
Mm. You know, the first thing
I noticed were these.


206
00:13:33.436 --> 00:13:34.738
Oh, sorry.

207
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.606
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.


208
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.374
No worries.

209
00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:40.910
So, uh, what are
we making tonight?


210
00:13:41.678 --> 00:13:43.580
-Excuse me?
-Oh, let me rephrase that.


211
00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:45.948
I meant what are you
making tonight?


212
00:13:46.082 --> 00:13:47.551
Oh, uh, nothing crazy.

213
00:13:47.684 --> 00:13:49.118
Just some quinoa shells

214
00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:51.187
and chicken broth
and tomato paste.


215
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.255
It's kinda like
a healthy version of fideo.


216
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:54.758
You know,
tomato paste can actually


217
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.225
help smooth out cellulite

218
00:13:56.359 --> 00:13:57.828
'cause it has high amounts
of lycopene.


219
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.096
Wow. No, I did not know that.

220
00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:01.798
Okay. That was too much.

221
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:02.932
What are you making?

222
00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:04.500
Uh, spaghetti Bolognese.

223
00:14:04.634 --> 00:14:07.103
-Spaghetti Bolognese. Oh!
-Bolognese. Sorry.


224
00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:08.504
Wow, master chef.

225
00:14:08.638 --> 00:14:10.206
Well, it's not
like I make my pasta


226
00:14:10.339 --> 00:14:11.541
from scratch or anything.

227
00:14:11.675 --> 00:14:14.043
Oh, I'm no longer impressed.

228
00:14:14.176 --> 00:14:15.478
But it is damn good.

229
00:14:15.612 --> 00:14:16.813
I bet it is.

230
00:14:18.914 --> 00:14:22.284
Um, well enjoy your evening.

231
00:14:22.418 --> 00:14:23.886
Okay.

232
00:14:37.768 --> 00:14:40.804
Which one is your favorite?
Let me guess. Strawberry.


233
00:14:40.936 --> 00:14:45.709
No. I mean, strawberry's great,
but coconut is better.


234
00:14:51.013 --> 00:14:54.950
<i>Gracias.</i> I drive all the way
across town for la michoacana.


235
00:14:55.084 --> 00:14:56.720
It is the best there is.

236
00:14:56.853 --> 00:14:59.955
Nice. Look, I-- I know
this is gonna sound strange,


237
00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:03.025
but, um,
I feel like I know you.


238
00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:05.928
Really? Where from?

239
00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:08.464
I mean, nowhere specific,
but it's just--


240
00:15:08.598 --> 00:15:11.802
Hey, listen, I can see
that you're married, okay?


241
00:15:11.934 --> 00:15:15.672
and I am not the mistress type.

242
00:15:15.806 --> 00:15:19.008
-No. And I'm not the, uh--
-The cheating type.


243
00:15:19.141 --> 00:15:20.577
No, I'm not.

244
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:25.981
Okay. Good. Well,
your wife is a lucky lady.


245
00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:45.334
Hey. Hey. You forgot these.

246
00:15:45.468 --> 00:15:48.738
Oh, my carrots! Yeah. I can't
forget these. Thank you.


247
00:15:48.872 --> 00:15:50.439
You are welcome, Fiona.

248
00:15:51.207 --> 00:15:52.642
How do you know my name?

249
00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:58.214
Oh, duh. Oh, my gosh. I always
forget that that's there.


250
00:15:58.347 --> 00:16:01.984
Um, well, okay, now you
know my name. And you are?


251
00:16:02.117 --> 00:16:03.587
Caleb. Pleasure.

252
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.221
-Nice to meet you, Caleb.
-And thank you for that


253
00:16:05.354 --> 00:16:07.156
lycopene tomato paste
cellulite tip.


254
00:16:07.289 --> 00:16:08.859
I'll be sure to work on that.

255
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:10.226
-Okay. Yeah, no problem.
-Pleasure.


256
00:16:10.359 --> 00:16:11.595
-All right, bye.
-Nice to meet you.


257
00:16:11.728 --> 00:16:13.028
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:16:24.574 --> 00:16:26.843
-Okay. You ready?
-Oh.


259
00:16:26.977 --> 00:16:27.944
Show me.

260
00:16:28.077 --> 00:16:29.746
Okay.

261
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:37.621
Okay.

262
00:16:37.754 --> 00:16:40.957

270
00:16:55.805 --> 00:16:57.908
Wow.

271
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.042
Congrats, babe. 
That's amazing.

272
00:17:00.175 --> 00:17:02.679
Thank you. Oh!

273
00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:05.047
I got you a little gift.

274
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.751
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.


275
00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:15.859
Oh, baby. It's us. I love it.

276
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.995
I'll cherish it
forever and ever.


277
00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:21.463
All right. So, what
do you wanna do tonight?


278
00:17:22.498 --> 00:17:26.603
So, Miguel is having
a celebratory get-together.


279
00:17:26.736 --> 00:17:28.404
-Mm-hmm.
-And I know you don't know


280
00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:30.607
any of my friends,
but Miguel knows all about you.


281
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:33.843
Hey, before you
even think it, okay,


282
00:17:33.977 --> 00:17:35.210
nobody there knows who you are.

283
00:17:35.344 --> 00:17:36.613
And besides,
we're gonna be together


284
00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:38.615
in a couple
of months anyway, right?


285
00:17:39.749 --> 00:17:42.953
Yeah. Okay. Let's do it.
It's your day, okay?


286
00:17:43.085 --> 00:17:44.554
Did someone say more champagne?

287
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:47.489
-Oh, yes. Please.
-Ooh, yeah.


288
00:17:47.624 --> 00:17:54.163
Well, congrats and cheers
to Miguel and Fiona.


289
00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:56.231
Yes!

290
00:17:57.466 --> 00:17:59.168
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

291
00:17:59.301 --> 00:18:01.470
I cannot believe you
are here in the flesh.


292
00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:03.238
I've heard so much about you.

293
00:18:03.372 --> 00:18:04.708
Your photos
don't do you justice,


294
00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:06.375
but I can see
why Fiona's so sprung.


295
00:18:08.377 --> 00:18:09.813
If you're interested,
I have some shoes


296
00:18:09.946 --> 00:18:11.380
that could prop you up
about an inch or two.


297
00:18:11.513 --> 00:18:14.116
Oh, sorry about
my fashion friends.


298
00:18:14.249 --> 00:18:15.752
They're obsessed
with height and looks.


299
00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:17.152
I mean, aren't we?

300
00:18:17.286 --> 00:18:19.022
Hello, everybody.

301
00:18:19.154 --> 00:18:20.389
-Hi, Molly.
-Hi.


302
00:18:20.523 --> 00:18:23.492
Oh, is this your design?
I love it.


303
00:18:23.627 --> 00:18:25.127
It is. Do you wanna buy it?

304
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.830
Maybe I do.

305
00:18:26.963 --> 00:18:29.231
Oh, congrats again on
your new feature in <i>Vogue.</i>


306
00:18:29.365 --> 00:18:30.767
Thank you.

307
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.435
Is this your boyfriend Fiona?
I never met him.


308
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.972
Yes. This is Caleb.

309
00:18:36.106 --> 00:18:37.206
You must be so proud

310
00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:38.642
-of your girl.
-Mm-hmm.


311
00:18:38.775 --> 00:18:39.843
How long have you
guys been together?


312
00:18:39.976 --> 00:18:41.243
About a year now.

313
00:18:41.377 --> 00:18:42.277
Yeah. The best year
of our lives.


314
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:44.114
Absolutely. Mm-hmm.

315
00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:46.616
- Yes.
- Get a room.


316
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.619
Oh, we will.

317
00:18:50.486 --> 00:18:51.855
So,
what did you think of Miguel?


318
00:18:51.988 --> 00:18:54.256
He's cool.
What an interesting group.


319
00:18:55.892 --> 00:18:58.227
Me and my-- me--

320
00:18:59.562 --> 00:19:01.430
And your soon to be ex.

321
00:19:01.564 --> 00:19:03.198
My soon-to-be ex.

322
00:19:03.332 --> 00:19:07.302
We, um, we really don't hang
out with interesting people.


323
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.973
You know
my favorite part of tonight?


324
00:19:10.106 --> 00:19:11.206
Mm-hmm.

325
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:14.110
It gave me a glimpse
into our future.


326
00:19:15.045 --> 00:19:17.446
You know, for once
we weren't sneaking around.


327
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.684
It was just nice and normal.

328
00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:25.689
It did, huh?
I felt completely at ease.


329
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:29.258
The--

330
00:19:30.694 --> 00:19:32.361
Whereabouts is your sister?

331
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:34.396
She lives in Paris.

332
00:19:34.531 --> 00:19:36.498
I actually haven't seen her
in over a year.


333
00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:39.435
We had a bit of a falling out.

334
00:19:40.036 --> 00:19:41.171
Over what?

335
00:19:41.303 --> 00:19:43.773
It's a long story,

336
00:19:44.974 --> 00:19:48.178
but we'll reconnect again.

337
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.946
We always do.

338
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.414
And once your divorce is final,
I'll introduce you to my mom


339
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:54.117
and the rest of my family.

340
00:19:54.249 --> 00:19:56.351
I'm sure you'll meet
my sister too.


341
00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:58.888
These last couple
of days have been


342
00:19:59.022 --> 00:20:00.090
so amazing with you.

343
00:20:00.222 --> 00:20:01.390
I'll call you later, okay?

344
00:20:01.524 --> 00:20:02.759
You promise?

345
00:20:02.892 --> 00:20:04.027
I promise.

346
00:20:04.594 --> 00:20:05.929
Fiona, don't worry, okay?

347
00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:08.131
I'm gonna follow through
with what I said.


348
00:20:08.263 --> 00:20:10.567
I made my choice
and I choose you.


349
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:16.005
Hello. Baby, I'm home.

350
00:20:17.707 --> 00:20:18.975
Oh, no.

351
00:20:20.309 --> 00:20:22.277
The plants are dying.

352
00:20:24.948 --> 00:20:26.683
Baby, are you here?

353
00:20:28.118 --> 00:20:29.819
Hey, Celine.

354
00:20:30.385 --> 00:20:31.855
-Hey.
-Hi.


355
00:20:31.988 --> 00:20:33.723
My plants are dying.
Why didn't you water them?


356
00:20:33.857 --> 00:20:37.627
Oh, uh, I forgot. I'm sorry.
Um, how was your trip?


357
00:20:38.194 --> 00:20:40.262
It was okay. You miss me?

358
00:20:40.395 --> 00:20:41.664
Of course, I did.

359
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.434
But you barely texted me.

360
00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:46.569
I know. I'm sorry.

361
00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:48.270
I was really busy at work

362
00:20:48.403 --> 00:20:49.906
and um, I know how focused
you have to be


363
00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:51.875
on your work trip,
so I didn't wanna bother you.


364
00:20:52.008 --> 00:20:53.076
Well, it's tough.

365
00:20:53.843 --> 00:20:56.846
If only I could get
the VP of marketing position,


366
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.581
things would've gone
more smoothly


367
00:20:58.715 --> 00:21:00.583
and I wouldn't need
to troubleshoot as much.


368
00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:02.185
Well, you're gonna get it.

369
00:21:02.317 --> 00:21:03.553
I have a good feeling
about that.


370
00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:05.822
Um, oh.

371
00:21:07.157 --> 00:21:10.026
Oh, this is work.
I-- I have to get this, okay?


372
00:21:11.628 --> 00:21:14.864
Hello? Hey.

373
00:21:34.483 --> 00:21:35.952
What's wrong?

374
00:21:36.085 --> 00:21:38.087
I'm exhausted, babe.

375
00:21:38.221 --> 00:21:41.057
How are we gonna have a baby
if we aren't even doing it?


376
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:42.559
We're gonna try tomorrow.

377
00:21:42.692 --> 00:21:46.428
It's not how it works.
I'm ovulating now.


378
00:21:47.096 --> 00:21:48.998
I thought you
said you wanted to try.


379
00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:52.501
Hm, tomorrow. I promise, okay?

380
00:22:06.448 --> 00:22:08.084
I cannot wait.

381
00:22:08.218 --> 00:22:10.385
I'm telling you just a little
bit longer and he is mine.


382
00:22:10.519 --> 00:22:12.555
He's yours? Like completely.

383
00:22:12.689 --> 00:22:14.224
Yeah.

384
00:22:21.496 --> 00:22:22.966
No, no, no, no.
I don't sound that dumb.


385
00:22:23.099 --> 00:22:24.433
-Yeah, you do. Sometimes.
-You are an asshole.


386
00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:27.570
Come on.
Aren't you happy for me?


387
00:22:27.704 --> 00:22:29.239
At least now,
you won't have to hear me bitch


388
00:22:29.371 --> 00:22:30.573
and complain about his wife.

389
00:22:30.707 --> 00:22:32.441
Oh, thank God.

390
00:22:32.575 --> 00:22:34.409
But you are making it
sound so easy.


391
00:22:34.544 --> 00:22:36.813
You do realize
divorces take like for evs.


392
00:22:36.946 --> 00:22:38.513
Yeah, but at least
he'll be with me


393
00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:40.183
while he's going through it.

394
00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:42.785
When he finally does it,
then I'll celebrate with you.


395
00:22:43.686 --> 00:22:44.888
Wait, wait, wait. You--

396
00:22:45.021 --> 00:22:46.488
you don't think
he's gonna do it?


397
00:22:46.623 --> 00:22:49.491
Girl, I see this happen
all the time.


398
00:22:49.626 --> 00:22:50.860
The husband tells the lover,

399
00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:52.629
"I'm gonna
leave my wife for you."


400
00:22:52.762 --> 00:22:54.030
And then, when it actually
comes to doing it,


401
00:22:54.163 --> 00:22:56.266
things get complicated,
reality hits


402
00:22:56.398 --> 00:22:57.767
and most of the time,

403
00:22:57.901 --> 00:22:59.401
<i>seĆ±or</i> prince
charming backs out.


404
00:22:59.535 --> 00:23:00.502
I'm just saying
if he finally does it,


405
00:23:00.637 --> 00:23:01.905
we can celebrate.

406
00:23:02.038 --> 00:23:03.706
Hell, I'll even
get you a fucking cake


407
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.376
and I'll have it decorated
"The boy is mine," Huh?


408
00:23:06.508 --> 00:23:08.144
You are such a jerk.

409
00:23:08.278 --> 00:23:09.946
Come on, Zora. We gotta
get back to the studio.


410
00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:11.948
-We got a lot of work to do.
-Yeah, work.


411
00:23:12.081 --> 00:23:14.984
You just wanna get back to
your fuck boy waiting on ice.


412
00:23:15.718 --> 00:23:17.053
Good to see you, Celine.

413
00:23:17.186 --> 00:23:18.755
Is your husband with you?

414
00:23:18.888 --> 00:23:22.424
No. He's at work. Why?
Is everything okay?


415
00:23:22.558 --> 00:23:23.960
Your health is A-okay,

416
00:23:24.093 --> 00:23:26.129
but I'd hate for you
to hear this alone.


417
00:23:26.262 --> 00:23:28.898
Is there a chance
you can call your husband in?


418
00:23:29.532 --> 00:23:30.833
He's at work.

419
00:23:32.268 --> 00:23:34.070
What is it? Just tell me.

420
00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:39.441
Your endometriosis has scarred
your fallopian tubes


421
00:23:39.575 --> 00:23:44.314
and your chances
of conceiving are less than 1%.


422
00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:49.052
Um, 1%?

423
00:23:49.185 --> 00:23:55.358
Uh... W-- what about IVF
or other alternatives?


424
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.428
I have your charts here.
I can show you.


425
00:23:58.561 --> 00:24:02.765
1%. 1%.

426
00:24:04.267 --> 00:24:06.903
I am terribly sorry.
Mrs. Castillo!


427
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:33.129
It's gonna
be good for business.


428
00:24:33.262 --> 00:24:35.164
Hey, let me
call you back, okay?


429
00:24:37.166 --> 00:24:38.601
Honey, what's wrong?

430
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:43.906
It's just, uh, 
I just got back

431
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.243
from the appointment
with the doctor


432
00:24:47.377 --> 00:24:48.644
and they said

433
00:24:49.145 --> 00:24:54.350
that I'm unable
to have children.


434
00:24:56.285 --> 00:25:00.957
All I ever wanted
is to have your baby, our baby,


435
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.028
and now that I can't have it,
I want it even more.


436
00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:10.066
And it's not even possible.
It's never been possible.


437
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.035
Everything's gonna be okay.

438
00:25:12.168 --> 00:25:15.038
Everything is
not gonna be okay.


439
00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:20.710
It is never gonna be okay.
You can't fix it.


440
00:25:25.048 --> 00:25:27.016
Let me get you
some tissue, okay?


441
00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:45.268
Oh, my God.

442
00:25:51.707 --> 00:25:53.576
Oh, my God.

443
00:26:07.356 --> 00:26:09.592
Honey, I think
we're out of tissue, okay?


444
00:26:09.725 --> 00:26:10.993
I can't find any.

445
00:26:12.795 --> 00:26:14.597
Who's Fiona?

446
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.668
Huh?

447
00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:21.971
Who's Fiona? Answer me.

448
00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:23.639
She's just a friend, okay?

449
00:26:23.773 --> 00:26:25.341
-Let me get my phone back.
-Just a friend?


450
00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:27.276
Yes.

451
00:26:28.744 --> 00:26:30.913
Give me.
Celine, give me back my phone.


452
00:26:31.047 --> 00:26:32.583
You changed your password.

453
00:26:32.715 --> 00:26:34.383
Now, I know that
you're hiding something.


454
00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:37.120
-Celine.
-Give me your password


455
00:26:37.253 --> 00:26:38.921
or I will break your phone
into pieces I swear.


456
00:26:39.055 --> 00:26:40.857
No need to get crazy.

457
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.393
Fine. There's only
a couple things it could be.


458
00:26:52.435 --> 00:26:55.004
Caleb, have you
been having an affair?


459
00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:59.576
This bitch just said
she's pregnant.


460
00:26:59.709 --> 00:27:01.144
-What?
-Is it your baby?


461
00:27:01.277 --> 00:27:03.746
Are you having a baby
with someone else?


462
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.048
Look, I-- I've been
meaning to tell you.


463
00:27:06.182 --> 00:27:08.050
I've been meaning
to talk to you.


464
00:27:08.184 --> 00:27:09.652
Have or haven't you
been having an affair?


465
00:27:09.785 --> 00:27:10.720
I don't know
anything about a ba--


466
00:27:10.853 --> 00:27:12.121
Yes, I had an affair.

467
00:27:12.255 --> 00:27:14.157
But I don't know
anything about a baby!


468
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.393
How could you! How could you!
How could you! How could you!


469
00:27:21.632 --> 00:27:24.800
No, no.

470
00:27:33.577 --> 00:27:36.212
She's having my baby.

471
00:27:38.781 --> 00:27:40.516
My baby.

472
00:27:40.651 --> 00:27:43.152
No.

473
00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:44.754
No.

474
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.726
I want you to start
at the beginning


475
00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.196
and I want complete honesty.

476
00:27:53.896 --> 00:27:56.199
I first wanna
start off by saying that


477
00:27:57.033 --> 00:27:59.368
it wasn't my intention
to hurt you


478
00:27:59.502 --> 00:28:01.337
or ruin our marriage.

479
00:28:02.405 --> 00:28:05.942
Celine, you are
an incredible woman.


480
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.545
Where did you first meet?

481
00:28:09.178 --> 00:28:11.981
I'm happy in our marriage

482
00:28:12.114 --> 00:28:15.384
and I wasn't out there
searching for another woman


483
00:28:15.518 --> 00:28:16.986
or to have an affair.

484
00:28:18.921 --> 00:28:21.724
At a grocery store
over a year ago.


485
00:28:22.725 --> 00:28:25.228
When was the first time
you had sex?


486
00:28:26.963 --> 00:28:28.331
It's-- it's not important.

487
00:28:28.464 --> 00:28:30.366
Answer the question!

488
00:28:31.434 --> 00:28:33.069
Within a week.

489
00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:37.273
Is that her?

490
00:28:39.842 --> 00:28:42.111
Caleb, is that her?

491
00:28:48.585 --> 00:28:54.056
My mom always said
I could never choose a man.


492
00:28:54.924 --> 00:28:57.226
I guess she was right.

493
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.961
Celine.

494
00:28:59.829 --> 00:29:01.732
You are a fucking coward.

495
00:29:01.864 --> 00:29:03.332
I hate myself
for doing this to you.


496
00:29:03.466 --> 00:29:06.335
Not as much as
I hate you right now.


497
00:29:08.572 --> 00:29:11.274
And I can promise you
that you will regret this.


498
00:29:14.645 --> 00:29:16.078
I'm so sorry.

499
00:29:30.527 --> 00:29:31.861
Baby.

500
00:29:31.994 --> 00:29:33.462
I've been waiting
for you to text me back.


501
00:29:33.597 --> 00:29:34.830
What's going on?

502
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:38.000
I-I just wanna ask,
and I don't wanna sound cruel,


503
00:29:38.134 --> 00:29:40.303
but is it my baby?

504
00:29:41.937 --> 00:29:43.306
It is yours.

505
00:29:43.806 --> 00:29:45.207
100%.

506
00:29:47.877 --> 00:29:49.011
Aren't you happy?

507
00:29:49.145 --> 00:29:50.547
I am.
I will be.


508
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.817
I just gotta tell you
everything that happened today.


509
00:29:55.384 --> 00:29:57.486
-Okay. Let's go inside.
-Okay.


510
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.405
I
-I guess this is it.

511
00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:19.543
You never even gave us a chance.

512
00:30:20.744 --> 00:30:24.080
A chance to work out
whatever it was that went wrong.


513
00:30:25.414 --> 00:30:27.983
And now you're not
even fighting to stay.


514
00:30:28.585 --> 00:30:29.919
You don't deserve this.

515
00:30:30.052 --> 00:30:31.320
You don't deserve
to be treated like this.


516
00:30:32.689 --> 00:30:35.891
Just know if it doesn't
work out, you can't come back.


517
00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:39.529
My lawyer will be in touch.

518
00:30:40.229 --> 00:30:42.198
You know,
this isn't easy for me either.


519
00:30:42.331 --> 00:30:43.899
Okay?
I still love you.


520
00:30:44.033 --> 00:30:46.235
You don't get
to say that to me anymore.


521
00:30:52.074 --> 00:30:54.210
-Caleb.
-Yeah?


522
00:30:55.878 --> 00:30:57.313
Is it your baby?

523
00:31:01.852 --> 00:31:03.285
Yeah.

524
00:31:18.802 --> 00:31:20.369
Son of a bitch!

525
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.119
She's all yours.

526
00:31:37.253 --> 00:31:39.088
Hey, wait,
you have to sign this.


527
00:31:39.922 --> 00:31:41.591
Uh, you have to sign this.

528
00:31:42.626 --> 00:31:43.693
Hey!

529
00:31:46.797 --> 00:31:48.230
What the hell?

530
00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:48.578
I am definitely outta my league
with all this stuff.


531
00:34:48.712 --> 00:34:52.481
It's okay.
I know what we need.


532
00:34:53.917 --> 00:34:55.085
Good.

533
00:34:55.217 --> 00:34:56.653
This is the one.

534
00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.689
Alright.
Well, let's do it.


535
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.759
And we'll come back
one more time


536
00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:04.460
or many times
'cause I'm not sure


537
00:35:04.594 --> 00:35:05.929
what we're gonna
get from the shower yet, so.


538
00:35:06.062 --> 00:35:07.363
Okay.

539
00:35:07.496 --> 00:35:09.398
I can't
wait to have your baby.


540
00:35:10.432 --> 00:35:12.167
And to get my body back.

541
00:35:12.301 --> 00:35:14.303
Yes, please.
I need your body back.


542
00:35:16.006 --> 00:35:18.808
You made me
be happiest woman on earth.


543
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.545
Excuse me, ma'am.

544
00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:24.848
Can I get by you
to grab that item there?


545
00:35:25.314 --> 00:35:26.583
- Sorry.
- Good choice.


546
00:35:26.716 --> 00:35:28.317
- Thank you.
- We will, uh,


547
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.687
email you the receipt
and the tracking number,


548
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.722
and, uh, you should get it
by next Friday.


549
00:35:32.856 --> 00:35:35.058
Perfect. And you
have our card on file?


550
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.358
Yes, I do.

551
00:35:36.492 --> 00:35:37.827
-Awesome.
-Thank you.


552
00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:39.428
It's pretty easy and fast.

553
00:35:39.562 --> 00:35:41.031
Yeah.
They don't want you to have


554
00:35:41.163 --> 00:35:42.866
any time
to think about it.


555
00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:45.234
Just don't look
at how much it costs.


556
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:56.946
Hey, lady!
What's wrong with you?


557
00:36:27.242 --> 00:36:28.912
-Hi.
-Hi, there.


558
00:36:30.747 --> 00:36:32.749
Congratulations.

559
00:36:32.882 --> 00:36:34.017
Excuse me?

560
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.585
Newly pregnant?

561
00:36:38.487 --> 00:36:42.025
Uh, yes, just a few weeks along.

562
00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:45.195
It never hurts
to read up on everything.


563
00:36:45.327 --> 00:36:46.696
Good for you.

564
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.497
I had four children
of my own, you know.


565
00:36:48.631 --> 00:36:50.299
I thought, oh no.

566
00:36:50.432 --> 00:36:53.069
Maybe I was mistaken and you
were just buying for a friend.


567
00:36:53.203 --> 00:36:55.972
You see, I can always tell.

568
00:36:56.106 --> 00:36:57.540
You can always tell?

569
00:36:57.674 --> 00:37:00.710
I can always tell
who the mothers-to-be are


570
00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:03.046
and who's just
shopping for a shower.


571
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.950
You see,
I wasn't wrong.


572
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:08.985
Thank you so much.

573
00:37:09.753 --> 00:37:11.788
It means a lot. I've
always wanted to be a mother.


574
00:37:11.921 --> 00:37:13.890
Boy or a girl
wouldn't matter to me.


575
00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:17.359
I'm sure your husband
is very excited.


576
00:37:17.493 --> 00:37:21.064
He is. He's gonna be
a great father.


577
00:37:21.831 --> 00:37:25.101
Bye now. Take care.
Come back soon.


578
00:37:25.235 --> 00:37:26.669
I will.

579
00:37:32.575 --> 00:37:34.276
- Just pack it up?
- Yeah.


580
00:37:34.677 --> 00:37:36.813
Hey, how's Celine?

581
00:37:36.946 --> 00:37:38.748
Has she been
by your place lately?


582
00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:40.415
We see her from time to time.

583
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.018
-Yeah?
-Yeah.


584
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.589
Yo, I thought
you two were happy.


585
00:37:47.724 --> 00:37:49.826
I was until I met Fiona.

586
00:37:51.528 --> 00:37:53.530
Dude, I'm having a baby.

587
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.965
Yeah, I-I can't
believe it either.


588
00:37:57.466 --> 00:37:58.902
All right, let's get outta here.

589
00:38:07.644 --> 00:38:10.613
Hey, is that your new car?

590
00:38:11.881 --> 00:38:14.150
I passed by that Italian place
that you love so much


591
00:38:14.284 --> 00:38:16.653
and got you some of like
crunchy bread that you like.


592
00:38:17.854 --> 00:38:20.389
What is this?
Why are you here?


593
00:38:20.523 --> 00:38:22.625
Shouldn't you be off
enjoying your new life?


594
00:38:22.992 --> 00:38:25.995
Celine, everything
happened so fast. Alright?


595
00:38:26.129 --> 00:38:28.363
Truth is, I'm just
not used to not living here


596
00:38:28.497 --> 00:38:30.667
with you
and being apart from you.


597
00:38:31.067 --> 00:38:32.467
And?

598
00:38:32.602 --> 00:38:34.304
And we were together
for such a long time.


599
00:38:34.436 --> 00:38:36.338
I can't just forget about you.

600
00:38:37.073 --> 00:38:38.473
Save your useless words.

601
00:38:38.608 --> 00:38:41.410
They're empty
and they don't change anything.


602
00:38:41.544 --> 00:38:45.582
You wanted this divorce and now
you're trying to butter me up.


603
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:48.551
You have some damn nerve.

604
00:38:56.358 --> 00:38:58.393
-I am sorry.
-Go.


605
00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:23.086
Caleb!

606
00:39:25.555 --> 00:39:26.956
Hey.

607
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.629
Come on, let's go outside.

608
00:39:35.798 --> 00:39:37.700
That bitch!

609
00:39:39.202 --> 00:39:40.435
Celine?

610
00:39:41.271 --> 00:39:44.107
Yes, Celine.
Who else would do this?


611
00:39:45.275 --> 00:39:47.944
Are you going to take care
of this or do I need to?


612
00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:50.780
I got it.

613
00:40:05.061 --> 00:40:06.829
<i>What the hell is wrong with</i>
<i>you?</i>


614
00:40:07.563 --> 00:40:10.333
I beg your pardon?
Is everything okay?


615
00:40:10.465 --> 00:40:11.834
Our house has been vandalized.

616
00:40:11.968 --> 00:40:13.636
And by the looks of it,
it's pretty obvious


617
00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.405
-that it was you.
-Trouble in paradise, Caleb?


618
00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:16.940
Cut the shit, Celine.

619
00:40:17.073 --> 00:40:19.375
Do you really think
the people don't know


620
00:40:19.508 --> 00:40:20.944
what you did to me?

621
00:40:21.644 --> 00:40:22.879
To us?

622
00:40:23.012 --> 00:40:24.247
Do you think people
look at you


623
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.848
and are honestly happy for you?

624
00:40:26.282 --> 00:40:28.217
You don't deserve
a happy life, Caleb.


625
00:40:28.351 --> 00:40:30.620
Am I gonna have to get
a restraining order against you?


626
00:40:30.753 --> 00:40:32.789
'Cause that's not
a good look for your reputation.


627
00:40:32.922 --> 00:40:34.691
Do you really think
you can convince anyone


628
00:40:34.824 --> 00:40:37.193
that I had
anything to do with this?


629
00:40:38.428 --> 00:40:39.762
Prove it.

630
00:40:43.766 --> 00:40:45.201
What happened?
What did she say?


631
00:40:51.674 --> 00:40:53.508
I swear,
if I wasn't pregnant,


632
00:40:53.643 --> 00:40:56.212
I would handle that
myself.


633
00:40:56.946 --> 00:40:58.648
So are we gonna
have to get a restraining order?


634
00:40:58.781 --> 00:41:00.950
I mean, I don't wanna be
looking over my shoulder, Caleb.


635
00:41:01.084 --> 00:41:02.885
I don't know.
I don't know.


636
00:41:03.019 --> 00:41:04.787
It might not be a good look
to get a restraining order


637
00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:06.622
while I'm trying
to finalize divorce.


638
00:41:06.756 --> 00:41:08.124
Not a good look?

639
00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:09.726
Look, it's gonna be
hard to convince anybody


640
00:41:09.859 --> 00:41:11.094
that she's behind this.

641
00:41:11.227 --> 00:41:12.829
Listen,
if she does something else,


642
00:41:12.962 --> 00:41:14.496
then we'll get
the restraining order.


643
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:17.567
Until then
I'll just install some cameras.


644
00:41:19.035 --> 00:41:20.970
-Okay. Fine.
-Come on.


645
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.275
<i>Damn, girl. 
That's crazy.</i>

646
00:41:26.409 --> 00:41:27.777
<i>But if the tables were turned,</i>

647
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:29.511
<i>I'm sure you</i>
<i>would've lashed out too.</i>


648
00:41:29.645 --> 00:41:31.481
You're not
taking her side, are you?


649
00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:33.082
<i>Of course not.</i>

650
00:41:33.216 --> 00:41:34.951
<i>But I'm just saying, girl,</i>
<i>you didn't think</i>


651
00:41:35.084 --> 00:41:36.753
<i>she would actually let</i>
<i>him go quietly, did you?</i>


652
00:41:37.854 --> 00:41:39.789
I mean, I kinda did.

653
00:41:41.557 --> 00:41:43.059
I just, I didn't
know that people


654
00:41:43.192 --> 00:41:45.561
in the suburbs had it
in them to get this crazy.


655
00:41:45.695 --> 00:41:48.698
<i>Never underestimate</i>
<i>a white bitch with money.</i>


656
00:41:52.068 --> 00:41:53.536
Yeah. Well,
after I have this baby,


657
00:41:53.669 --> 00:41:55.638
she better not
underestimate me either.


658
00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:06.616
Shit!

659
00:42:06.749 --> 00:42:08.084
You miss me, baby?

660
00:42:08.217 --> 00:42:09.552
Come fuck me.

661
00:42:09.685 --> 00:42:11.087
Oh my God, you're wasted.

662
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.455
- Where's your clothes?
- Come on, Caleb.


663
00:42:12.588 --> 00:42:13.823
Stop being such a.

664
00:42:13.956 --> 00:42:15.591
Cover up!

665
00:42:16.592 --> 00:42:17.894
Playing hard to get, are you?

666
00:42:18.027 --> 00:42:19.562
You're drunk.
I'm taking you home.


667
00:42:19.695 --> 00:42:21.064
No!

668
00:42:21.197 --> 00:42:22.832
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ!


669
00:42:22.965 --> 00:42:25.001
How could
you do this to me, Caleb?


670
00:42:30.206 --> 00:42:32.975
Slap on
the hand for the vandalism.


671
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:34.243
It's done.

672
00:42:34.377 --> 00:42:35.546
I'll forget about it.

673
00:42:36.112 --> 00:42:39.749
But no more surprises, please.

674
00:42:41.317 --> 00:42:42.752
Or it's gonna get ugly.

675
00:42:44.587 --> 00:42:46.022
I mean that.

676
00:42:46.956 --> 00:42:50.193
It's all nice.
And the spread looks so good.


677
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:52.829
Oh.

678
00:42:55.798 --> 00:42:56.933
<i>Mi amor.</i>

679
00:42:57.066 --> 00:42:58.501
Hi, baby.

680
00:42:58.868 --> 00:43:00.136
-What's up, bro?
-Good to see you.


681
00:43:00.269 --> 00:43:02.171
-Good to see you too.
-Quick pic.


682
00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:03.506
-Yes.
-Oh, yeah.


683
00:43:03.639 --> 00:43:04.575
Yes.

684
00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:05.741
I'll sign it later on.

685
00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:07.210
Oh good.
Me too.


686
00:43:11.747 --> 00:43:12.915
This is looking really nice.

687
00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:14.784
-It looks good, right?
-Yeah.


688
00:43:14.917 --> 00:43:18.187
Alright, baby. You're
used to getting all these balls.


689
00:43:20.823 --> 00:43:23.126
You got this.
There you go.


690
00:43:23.259 --> 00:43:25.027
So far you got two balls.
Good job.


691
00:43:25.394 --> 00:43:27.564
You're lying.
I have to have more than that.


692
00:43:27.697 --> 00:43:29.065
Girl, come on. No.

693
00:43:29.198 --> 00:43:30.800
- Come on, sweetie.
- Right there.


694
00:43:30.933 --> 00:43:32.135
- There you go.
- Right there. Okay.


695
00:43:32.835 --> 00:43:34.605
Are you taking them away?

696
00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:35.972
Oh, no. Not at all.

697
00:43:36.105 --> 00:43:37.440
You're gonna
open your eyes and see.


698
00:43:37.574 --> 00:43:39.142
Oh, okay.
Okay, okay.


699
00:43:39.275 --> 00:43:41.144
There you go.
There you go.


700
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.182
You guys are messing with me!

701
00:44:08.037 --> 00:44:11.240
Oh my God.
It's hot in there.


702
00:44:11.374 --> 00:44:12.508
It sure is.

703
00:44:12.643 --> 00:44:14.310
This probably doesn't help.

704
00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:16.647
But it looks like
everyone's having so much fun.


705
00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:18.047
Everyone
is having a great time.


706
00:44:18.181 --> 00:44:19.482
- It's so good.
- And you won


707
00:44:19.616 --> 00:44:20.850
all the games.
I love it.


708
00:44:20.983 --> 00:44:22.251
I think
everyone let me win.


709
00:44:22.385 --> 00:44:23.753
Yeah, of course.

710
00:44:26.822 --> 00:44:28.824
-Oh, I feel it.
-You feel that?


711
00:44:28.958 --> 00:44:30.393
Oh, my God.

712
00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.429
Oh my God. Oh!

713
00:44:33.564 --> 00:44:34.764
Oh!

714
00:44:34.897 --> 00:44:36.165
Oh my God.
It like butterflies.


715
00:44:36.299 --> 00:44:37.366
Yeah.

716
00:44:41.904 --> 00:44:43.773
- I love you.
- I love you too.


717
00:44:45.308 --> 00:44:46.842
Alright,
I think I need to sit down.


718
00:44:46.976 --> 00:44:48.411
I got you.

719
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:50.647
-Alright. Thank you.
-Alright. You good?


720
00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.048
Yes.

721
00:45:16.573 --> 00:45:19.208
Oh, my goodness.

722
00:45:20.776 --> 00:45:23.446
Oh, so cute.

723
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.115
-Gracias, <i>tia.</i>
<i>-De nada.</i>


724
00:46:37.853 --> 00:46:39.322
Lena, where's Fiona?

725
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:40.757
In-- in the ambulance.
Go. Go.


726
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:42.325
Fiona! Fiona!

727
00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:46.462
Hey. Oh my God.
Are you okay? You okay?


728
00:46:46.929 --> 00:46:48.064
I'm okay.
I got out--


729
00:46:48.197 --> 00:46:49.533
-Is the baby okay?
-Yes.


730
00:46:49.666 --> 00:46:51.267
The baby's okay.
I'm okay.


731
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.336
I got out as fast as I could
and I just held my breath.


732
00:46:53.804 --> 00:46:54.937
Oh, my God.

733
00:46:55.071 --> 00:46:56.606
Oh my God, baby.
Where's my mom?


734
00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.407
She's fine, she's fine.
She's back there. She's okay.


735
00:46:58.542 --> 00:47:00.476
She's fine. Okay?
Looks like nobody got hurt.


736
00:47:01.243 --> 00:47:02.945
- Caleb. Fiona.
- Yeah.


737
00:47:03.079 --> 00:47:04.480
I'm Martin.
I own this building.


738
00:47:04.614 --> 00:47:06.916
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened today,


739
00:47:07.049 --> 00:47:09.118
but I'm so glad
that everybody got out safely.


740
00:47:09.251 --> 00:47:11.387
- What the hell happened?
- I'm not a 100% sure


741
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.357
but it could have to do
with an electrical shortage.


742
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:15.826
Here's my card.

743
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:17.426
We'll be in touch
with further information


744
00:47:17.561 --> 00:47:20.029
and insurance
for any losses or damage.


745
00:47:20.831 --> 00:47:22.264
I'm terribly sorry.

746
00:47:23.366 --> 00:47:24.601
Okay.

747
00:47:33.175 --> 00:47:36.278
Hey, don't
get yourself worked up.


748
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.348
Fiona,
I could have lost you


749
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:41.250
and I don't take that lightly.

750
00:47:41.384 --> 00:47:43.185
Your whole family was inside.

751
00:47:44.887 --> 00:47:46.322
I know. But I'm...

752
00:47:47.323 --> 00:47:48.759
trying not
to think about it


753
00:47:48.891 --> 00:47:51.160
so I don't
put stress on the baby.


754
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:57.400
You're right. I'm sorry.

755
00:47:58.568 --> 00:47:59.902
I have
the owner's card, um,


756
00:48:00.035 --> 00:48:01.470
I'm gonna be in touch with him.

757
00:48:02.773 --> 00:48:04.039
Okay?

758
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.085
My wrist
is starting to cramp.


759
00:48:50.821 --> 00:48:52.154
I know.

760
00:48:52.288 --> 00:48:54.825
Oh, we are going
to make a killing


761
00:48:54.957 --> 00:48:56.292
on this collection, Miguel.

762
00:48:56.425 --> 00:48:57.861
-I can feel it.
-We better.


763
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:04.500
Ooh, break me
off a piece of that.


764
00:49:05.267 --> 00:49:07.470
Ooh. Oh, Those eyebrows
are on point.


765
00:49:07.604 --> 00:49:09.573
I know.

766
00:49:10.105 --> 00:49:11.541
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.


767
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:42.973
I know I'm a little late,
but I did promise.


768
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.141
- No!
- The boy is mine.


769
00:49:46.275 --> 00:49:47.811
He is.

770
00:49:47.944 --> 00:49:49.078
-You got him, girl.
-Mm.


771
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:50.614
You got my favorite?

772
00:49:50.747 --> 00:49:52.849
-Yeah.
-Mm. Mm.


773
00:49:56.285 --> 00:49:59.355
He freaking better be
at this point, right?


774
00:50:04.928 --> 00:50:07.631
Alan.
Look, there's Celine.


775
00:50:07.764 --> 00:50:09.131
What?

776
00:50:12.969 --> 00:50:14.971
What in the actual fuck?

777
00:50:15.104 --> 00:50:16.740
Hide. I don't
want her to see us.


778
00:50:20.075 --> 00:50:21.778
We're not gonna
mention this to anyone.


779
00:50:21.912 --> 00:50:23.412
We're just-- we're just gonna
pretend like we never saw this.


780
00:50:23.547 --> 00:50:25.247
Okay? She would be
mortified if she saw us.


781
00:50:25.381 --> 00:50:27.684
Why?

782
00:50:50.139 --> 00:50:52.107
This
is a friend of Jacques'.


783
00:50:53.475 --> 00:50:58.280
My confirmation code
is 439B as in boy,


784
00:50:59.348 --> 00:51:01.785
T as in Tom, 99.

785
00:51:03.653 --> 00:51:08.157
I need something big done
and I'm willing to pay


786
00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.492
any amount of money
to get it done.


787
00:51:12.762 --> 00:51:16.833
Sounds fantastic.
I'll be in touch.


788
00:51:35.652 --> 00:51:36.786
Please!

789
00:51:37.587 --> 00:51:39.789
Please take care of my baby.

790
00:51:39.923 --> 00:51:42.592
No.

791
00:51:44.259 --> 00:51:45.729
Please. No!

792
00:51:45.862 --> 00:51:47.097
-Please!
-Baby.


793
00:51:47.463 --> 00:51:48.698
Wake up. Wake up.

794
00:51:48.832 --> 00:51:50.299
You're just
having a bad dream.


795
00:51:52.368 --> 00:51:54.336
Okay?
Just a bad dream.


796
00:52:00.476 --> 00:52:02.177
If anything happens to me,

797
00:52:02.311 --> 00:52:04.279
just know that I love you.

798
00:52:05.048 --> 00:52:06.415
Please take care of our baby.

799
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:07.984
Hey, hey, hey.
Relax.


800
00:52:08.551 --> 00:52:09.986
Don't be saying that.
Okay?


801
00:52:10.587 --> 00:52:12.254
You're fine.
It's just a dream.


802
00:52:12.388 --> 00:52:13.657
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.


803
00:52:20.897 --> 00:52:22.766
Oh, that's beautiful.

804
00:52:22.899 --> 00:52:24.333
Beautiful.

805
00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:26.603
Caleb, you can
go ahead and join her.


806
00:52:26.736 --> 00:52:28.370
-Hey, baby.
-All right.


807
00:52:30.239 --> 00:52:31.675
Oh, I love it.

808
00:52:32.341 --> 00:52:35.477
Perfect.
You guys are too cute.


809
00:53:01.938 --> 00:53:03.073
You did it.

810
00:53:15.819 --> 00:53:17.453
I am looking for Celine.

811
00:53:17.754 --> 00:53:18.688
I'm Celine.

812
00:53:18.822 --> 00:53:20.322
I'm here
to pick up payment


813
00:53:20.456 --> 00:53:22.357
for today's
business transaction.


814
00:53:22.926 --> 00:53:24.761
So when you say today,
does that mean


815
00:53:24.894 --> 00:53:26.328
that they're
at the hospital now?


816
00:53:26.462 --> 00:53:27.697
Correct.

817
00:53:28.031 --> 00:53:29.866
So can you tell me
who's on the job?


818
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.367
That, I cannot.

819
00:53:38.575 --> 00:53:39.943
What are you
offering an exchange


820
00:53:40.076 --> 00:53:41.711
for this information?

821
00:53:42.411 --> 00:53:43.780
What do you want?

822
00:54:21.818 --> 00:54:22.986
Dr. Smith?

823
00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:24.386
Yes.

824
00:54:25.188 --> 00:54:26.656
Are you new here?

825
00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:28.825
I'm Celine.

826
00:54:28.958 --> 00:54:31.293
I hired
you for today's transaction.


827
00:54:32.327 --> 00:54:35.231
What on earth
are you doing here?


828
00:54:35.932 --> 00:54:39.803
It's company policy
that we don't meet.


829
00:54:40.335 --> 00:54:41.971
If I were to speak of this,

830
00:54:42.471 --> 00:54:45.575
our new messenger boy
would be killed.


831
00:54:45.708 --> 00:54:48.745
I'm just here to make sure
everything runs smoothly.


832
00:54:48.878 --> 00:54:52.749
This isn't my first rodeo, dear.

833
00:54:54.884 --> 00:54:58.888
Do you know
what bothers me about society?


834
00:55:00.156 --> 00:55:05.327
No one ever pairs a pretty face

835
00:55:07.697 --> 00:55:09.799
with unspeakable crime.

836
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.770
Pretty people
don't have perfect lives.


837
00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.441
Run along now, darling.

838
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.411
I'll take it from here.

839
00:55:40.429 --> 00:55:42.599
Look at the little cheeks.

840
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:49.038
<i>Gracias,</i> Lena.

841
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:02.685
Hi.

842
00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.023
Now that I see him, he looks
like a Brody.


843
00:56:07.156 --> 00:56:08.691
What do you think?

844
00:56:08.825 --> 00:56:11.728
Brody Caleb Castillo.
It's got a nice ring to it.


845
00:56:11.861 --> 00:56:12.929
Mm-hmm.

846
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:16.266
Hi, baby Brody.

847
00:56:16.799 --> 00:56:18.735
I'm gonna take
him to the nursery.


848
00:56:19.302 --> 00:56:20.570
Okay. Alright.

849
00:56:20.703 --> 00:56:22.038
Not for long.

850
00:56:22.171 --> 00:56:23.606
Oh.

851
00:56:26.408 --> 00:56:27.677
Thank you.

852
00:56:35.685 --> 00:56:38.420
-We did it, baby.
-We did. Huh?


853
00:56:46.428 --> 00:56:47.664
That was weird.

854
00:56:47.964 --> 00:56:49.899
-Yeah.
-It's a haunted hospital.


855
00:56:50.033 --> 00:56:52.101
Stop.

856
00:56:56.406 --> 00:56:57.840
It's okay, baby.
You can take it.


857
00:56:57.974 --> 00:56:59.542
Yeah?
All right. Well--


858
00:56:59.676 --> 00:57:01.110
I'm exhausted.
I'm just gonna take a nap.


859
00:57:01.244 --> 00:57:02.845
Okay. I'm gonna take
it outside. All right.


860
00:57:02.979 --> 00:57:04.580
If you need anything, text me.

861
00:57:06.015 --> 00:57:08.051
I can't wait for you to see him.

862
00:57:08.184 --> 00:57:09.919
He's adorable.

863
00:57:10.753 --> 00:57:13.089
Oh, my gosh.

864
00:57:22.532 --> 00:57:23.866
Could you step out for a moment?

865
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.369
I wanna go over
some protocols with Fiona.


866
00:57:26.501 --> 00:57:28.004
Sure thing, doctor.

867
00:57:44.454 --> 00:57:46.521
Wait, is that really necessary?

868
00:57:46.656 --> 00:57:47.924
I would rather keep them open.

869
00:57:48.057 --> 00:57:49.525
We want some privacy.

870
00:57:49.659 --> 00:57:51.561
I have some
questions to ask you.


871
00:57:52.161 --> 00:57:53.363
About what?

872
00:57:53.495 --> 00:57:55.932
You are not the doctor.

873
00:58:00.703 --> 00:58:03.172
I'm so sorry.

874
00:58:46.115 --> 00:58:47.183
Clear.

875
00:58:48.384 --> 00:58:50.119
-Hey, what's going on in there?
-Sir, I'm sorry.


876
00:58:50.253 --> 00:58:52.021
I can't have anyone over here.

877
00:58:52.155 --> 00:58:53.723
Why is he doing that?
That's my girlfriend in there.


878
00:58:53.856 --> 00:58:54.924
Why is he doing that to her?
What's going on?


879
00:58:55.058 --> 00:58:56.492
-Doctor knows what he's doing.

880
00:58:56.626 --> 00:58:57.860
Please, please.
I need you to calm down.


881
00:58:57.994 --> 00:58:59.562
Let's just wait
right over here for me.


882
00:58:59.695 --> 00:59:01.197
Okay? Come on.
The doctor will come out.


883
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:02.732
The doctor will come out
and everything is gonna be okay.


884
00:59:02.865 --> 00:59:04.500
Alright?
The doctor will come out.


885
00:59:04.634 --> 00:59:05.768
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just wait right here for me.


886
00:59:05.902 --> 00:59:07.637
Please. Wait right here.

887
00:59:08.638 --> 00:59:09.906
Oh God, Fiona.

888
00:59:14.043 --> 00:59:15.778
Do you know something?
Tell me--


889
00:59:15.912 --> 00:59:17.647
I don't know. I don't know
what's going on. Hey.


890
00:59:19.315 --> 00:59:21.250
-Are you Fiona's husband?
-Yeah.


891
00:59:23.086 --> 00:59:25.488
There were
unforeseen complications.


892
00:59:25.621 --> 00:59:27.323
She went into cardiac arrest.

893
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:29.592
We did everything
that we could to save her,


894
00:59:29.725 --> 00:59:31.427
but I'm sorry
to tell you this,


895
00:59:31.562 --> 00:59:32.929
she didn't make it.

896
00:59:33.062 --> 00:59:34.797
Wait, I was just in
there a few minutes ago.


897
00:59:34.931 --> 00:59:35.998
What do you mean she didn't
make it? She was fine.


898
00:59:36.132 --> 00:59:37.667
I'm truly sorry for you loss.

899
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:38.868
What do you mean
you're sorry for my loss?


900
00:59:39.001 --> 00:59:40.369
What happened-- what-
- Fiona?

901
00:59:40.503 --> 00:59:42.338
Wait, what happened?
Tell me.


902
00:59:42.472 --> 00:59:43.706
What happened?

903
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:44.874
What do you mean
she didn't make it?


904
00:59:45.007 --> 00:59:46.442
What do you mean?

905
00:59:46.577 --> 00:59:48.678
What the fuck does that mean?
What you mean?


906
00:59:48.811 --> 00:59:49.979
What do you mean?

907
00:59:50.113 --> 00:59:52.515
Tell me, please.
What do you mean?


908
00:59:52.648 --> 00:59:54.350
What do you mean? God, no!

909
00:59:54.484 --> 00:59:56.085
What the fuck does that mean?

910
01:00:15.705 --> 01:00:17.173
Yeah.

911
01:00:18.508 --> 01:00:22.245
Caleb, I know you're sad.

912
01:00:23.547 --> 01:00:25.114
I sad too.

913
01:00:25.248 --> 01:00:27.950
Every day I miss my daughter,

914
01:00:28.885 --> 01:00:30.686
but she's in here now,

915
01:00:32.788 --> 01:00:36.425
and she left us
the best gift ever.


916
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.394
Baby Brody.

917
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.835
Um, I have to get to work.

918
01:00:45.968 --> 01:00:48.204
Um, now I'll be
back at six as usual.


919
01:00:51.007 --> 01:00:53.442
Caleb, I like cooking for you.

920
01:00:53.577 --> 01:00:55.244
You are working all day.

921
01:00:58.114 --> 01:01:00.750
Okay. Fair enough.
<i>Gracious,</i> Elena.


922
01:01:02.418 --> 01:01:03.819
Bye, Brody.

923
01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.322
I love you.

924
01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:08.124
<i>Gracias.</i>

925
01:01:08.257 --> 01:01:09.692
Okay.

926
01:01:20.403 --> 01:01:21.904
Uh, Elena...

927
01:01:24.473 --> 01:01:26.409
...could you
put these inside for me?


928
01:01:34.817 --> 01:01:36.687
Mm-hmm. <i>Gracias.</i>

929
01:01:36.819 --> 01:01:39.088
Okay.

930
01:01:52.201 --> 01:01:54.136
<i>I've been meaning</i>
<i>to reach out to you.</i>


931
01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.673
<i>I just didn't know what to say.</i>

932
01:01:56.806 --> 01:02:01.410
<i>I wanted to give you some time</i>
<i>and let you grieve in peace.</i>


933
01:02:01.545 --> 01:02:06.782
<i>It might sound strange,</i>
<i>but I'm sorry for your loss.</i>


934
01:02:06.916 --> 01:02:08.451
<i>I think of you</i>

935
01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:11.153
<i>and I think of you</i>
<i>raising a baby all on your own.</i>


936
01:02:11.287 --> 01:02:14.257
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>how hard that must be.</i>


937
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:17.126
<i>Despite everything,</i>
<i>I'm here for you.</i>


938
01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.563
<i>I've put the past behind me.</i>

939
01:02:19.696 --> 01:02:22.331
<i>Please call</i>
<i>if you need anything.</i>


940
01:02:22.465 --> 01:02:25.535
<i>Hopefully, someday</i>
<i>I'll get to meet your son.</i>


941
01:02:25.669 --> 01:02:27.671
<i>Yours truly, Celine.</i>

942
01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:42.885
Oh, Brody.

943
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.023
I am sorry your mom's not here.

944
01:03:25.027 --> 01:03:27.664
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>


945
01:03:27.798 --> 01:03:33.235
<i>I was calling to see if you</i>
<i>wanted to do lunch sometime.</i>


946
01:03:34.538 --> 01:03:38.341
You-- you wanna go out
for lunch? What for?


947
01:03:38.474 --> 01:03:40.811
<i>I know you've been</i>
<i>through so much</i>


948
01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:43.946
<i>and I just wanna catch up.</i>

949
01:03:44.347 --> 01:03:46.515
<i>You said you could never</i>
<i>forget about me.</i>


950
01:03:48.117 --> 01:03:50.419
<i>How's Saturday?</i>

951
01:03:50.554 --> 01:03:52.622
Yeah, sure.

952
01:03:56.459 --> 01:03:58.762
Your order
will be coming right out.


953
01:03:58.894 --> 01:04:00.463
Great.

954
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:04.266
Here you go.
I'll go ahead and take these.


955
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.469
Oh, thanks.

956
01:04:12.676 --> 01:04:14.977
Caleb, hi.

957
01:04:15.478 --> 01:04:17.046
Hi.

958
01:04:19.649 --> 01:04:21.585
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you.


959
01:04:21.718 --> 01:04:23.152
You-- you look great.

960
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.422
-Thanks for meeting me.
-Yeah.


961
01:04:27.624 --> 01:04:29.125
-Oh.
-Yeah.


962
01:04:35.832 --> 01:04:39.902
So, uh,
I-I think it's Brody?


963
01:04:40.035 --> 01:04:42.271
-I'd love to see his picture.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.


964
01:04:42.739 --> 01:04:44.006
Um.

965
01:04:48.477 --> 01:04:49.546
Oh.

966
01:04:51.213 --> 01:04:52.883
He's adorable.

967
01:04:53.315 --> 01:04:56.553
Wow.
He looks just like you.


968
01:04:57.353 --> 01:04:58.655
You have a mini-me.

969
01:04:58.789 --> 01:05:00.189
Yeah, that's-- that's my boy.

970
01:05:00.322 --> 01:05:01.924
He's growing up so quickly.

971
01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.296
Well, if you ever need
a babysitter,


972
01:05:07.963 --> 01:05:09.231
you can call me.

973
01:05:10.132 --> 01:05:11.367
I mean that.

974
01:05:11.934 --> 01:05:13.369
Really?
You sure?


975
01:05:14.937 --> 01:05:16.606
I put the past behind me.

976
01:05:16.972 --> 01:05:18.642
I don't resent you anymore.

977
01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:22.511
So there's no reason
why we can't be friends.


978
01:05:23.479 --> 01:05:26.783
I guess as long
as it's not painful for you.


979
01:05:30.453 --> 01:05:32.321
-It's good to see you.
-You too.


980
01:05:32.756 --> 01:05:33.757
Here you guys go.

981
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:34.957
Yes.

982
01:05:35.525 --> 01:05:37.326
-You guys enjoy.
-Thank you.


983
01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.961
-Thank you.
-Of course.


984
01:05:39.495 --> 01:05:42.998
Um, it's your favorite,
pastrami.


985
01:05:43.132 --> 01:05:45.234
Yeah. Alright, let's do this.

986
01:05:48.738 --> 01:05:50.941
No, <i>problema.</i>
I-I'll call Lucia.


987
01:05:51.073 --> 01:05:52.341
<i>Gracias.</i>

988
01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.381
<i>Hola</i> , Lucia.

989
01:06:00.382 --> 01:06:02.151
You can't come in
Wednesday either?


990
01:06:03.152 --> 01:06:05.187
Elena can't do it on Wednesday.

991
01:06:07.323 --> 01:06:10.226
No. No, <i>problema.</i>
I'll-- I'll figure it out.


992
01:06:10.359 --> 01:06:12.194
<i>Gracias.</i> Okay?

993
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:22.539
Oh, Fiona, I wish you were here.

994
01:06:35.652 --> 01:06:36.887
Hi, Celine?

995
01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:39.288
Yeah. Ab-- absolutely.

996
01:06:39.421 --> 01:06:41.056
<i>Are you sure?</i>

997
01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:44.828
Uh, yeah.
I'd be happy to.


998
01:06:44.961 --> 01:06:46.663
<i>Well, come by on Sunday</i>

999
01:06:46.796 --> 01:06:49.265
<i>and if I see that you'll,</i>
<i>you know, do okay with him</i>


1000
01:06:49.398 --> 01:06:50.934
<i>then I'll let you</i>
<i>fill in on Wednesday.</i>


1001
01:06:51.066 --> 01:06:53.870
<i>-Wait, aren't you working?</i>
-Not on Wednesdays.


1002
01:06:54.004 --> 01:06:55.271
<i>Perfect.</i>

1003
01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.707
Great.

1004
01:07:09.418 --> 01:07:11.922
Clean bottles are up there.
The tops are somewhere.


1005
01:07:12.054 --> 01:07:13.455
I'm sorry the kitchen's
such a mess.


1006
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:15.625
-I haven't had time to clean.
-It's fine.


1007
01:07:15.759 --> 01:07:17.293
Yeah.

1008
01:07:27.871 --> 01:07:28.905
Look who woke up.

1009
01:07:34.343 --> 01:07:37.446
Oh! There he is.

1010
01:07:38.682 --> 01:07:39.783
May I?

1011
01:07:39.916 --> 01:07:41.551
Yeah.

1012
01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:46.723
Hey there, cutie,

1013
01:07:46.856 --> 01:07:51.528
We are gonna have so much fun,
aren't we? Aren't we?


1014
01:07:51.661 --> 01:07:55.031
All right. I gotta head out.
Um, you good?


1015
01:07:55.164 --> 01:07:56.766
I'm great.

1016
01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:00.102
Well, call me
if you need anything, okay?


1017
01:08:00.804 --> 01:08:01.972
-Celine.
-Yeah.


1018
01:08:02.104 --> 01:08:03.505
Thank you.

1019
01:08:09.546 --> 01:08:10.614
Bye.

1020
01:10:00.355 --> 01:10:01.958
I miss you so much.

1021
01:10:21.077 --> 01:10:23.947
Oh, is today Thursday?

1022
01:10:24.581 --> 01:10:28.218
I totally forgot
it was your day to watch him.


1023
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.487
Um, Caleb had
to leave to work early.


1024
01:10:32.756 --> 01:10:34.289
If you want, I can watch him.

1025
01:10:34.423 --> 01:10:37.227
Celine, this is my grandbaby.

1026
01:10:37.359 --> 01:10:39.229
I have not seen him all week.

1027
01:10:40.096 --> 01:10:44.567
I watch him today.
You, you go home. Mm?


1028
01:11:26.609 --> 01:11:28.310
Last night reminded me

1029
01:11:28.443 --> 01:11:31.581
of the year
we first started going out.


1030
01:11:31.714 --> 01:11:33.315
Mm-hmm.

1031
01:11:33.448 --> 01:11:34.984
That was a fun time.

1032
01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.455
-Caleb.
-Mm-hmm.


1033
01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:43.893
Let's go home.

1034
01:11:50.633 --> 01:11:52.501
-Hi, Celine.
-Hi.


1035
01:11:59.542 --> 01:12:02.377
- Look, who's that?
- That's Mama.


1036
01:12:02.511 --> 01:12:04.379
That's Mama. Yeah.

1037
01:12:04.513 --> 01:12:08.017
Look, look. Who's that?

1038
01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:11.955
That's <i>Abuelita.</i>
Grandma.


1039
01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:15.490
Nana. Yeah.

1040
01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:17.727
You recognize her, huh?

1041
01:12:17.861 --> 01:12:21.764
Ah, she would've been
so happy to be here with you.


1042
01:12:24.167 --> 01:12:25.735
You look so much like her.

1043
01:12:27.402 --> 01:12:29.973
Look, it's mama again.

1044
01:12:31.774 --> 01:12:34.010
I can't tell you how
ecstatic I am for you, darling.


1045
01:12:34.143 --> 01:12:35.712
There was a minute there
where I thought


1046
01:12:35.845 --> 01:12:37.313
you'd spiral down
a rabbit hole so deep


1047
01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:38.281
that even I
couldn't dig you out.


1048
01:12:38.882 --> 01:12:40.449
Who's watching
the little bugger today?


1049
01:12:40.583 --> 01:12:41.885
His grandmother.

1050
01:12:42.619 --> 01:12:43.720
How's that dynamic?

1051
01:12:43.853 --> 01:12:44.621
What?

1052
01:12:44.754 --> 01:12:46.089
You and the grandmother?

1053
01:12:46.521 --> 01:12:48.490
I mean, she's his grandmother.

1054
01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:49.626
It is what it is.

1055
01:12:49.759 --> 01:12:51.027
If my mother were alive,

1056
01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.829
she'd be the one
watching him today.


1057
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.132
Well, he is
an absolute heartbreaker.


1058
01:12:56.566 --> 01:12:58.101
Thanks.

1059
01:12:58.234 --> 01:13:00.603
I think he kinda looks like me.

1060
01:13:02.437 --> 01:13:03.706
Hmm.

1061
01:13:19.989 --> 01:13:21.557
Oh!

1062
01:13:24.861 --> 01:13:26.129
Oh my God. I know you.

1063
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:31.935
This-- this is you, right?
You're Caleb.


1064
01:13:33.536 --> 01:13:35.038
I'm Fiona's sister, Fabiola.

1065
01:13:35.171 --> 01:13:38.841
-It is so nice to meet you.
-Hi. Yes. Uh, right.


1066
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:42.545
I-I hope you don't mind.
Um, I'm--


1067
01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:45.214
my mom gave me her locket
after she passed.


1068
01:13:45.915 --> 01:13:46.983
No.

1069
01:13:48.217 --> 01:13:49.986
You know, I-I thought
we would've met sooner,


1070
01:13:50.119 --> 01:13:54.123
but you, um,
you weren't at the funeral.


1071
01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:58.460
Yeah. I-I'm sorry about that.
I just couldn't face going.


1072
01:13:59.195 --> 01:14:00.964
Yeah, no, I get it.

1073
01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:05.134
I can't believe
I ran into you like this.


1074
01:14:05.268 --> 01:14:06.769
I just moved back into town

1075
01:14:06.903 --> 01:14:08.371
and it's been
a little crazy,


1076
01:14:08.503 --> 01:14:09.939
but I've been meaning
to get in touch


1077
01:14:10.073 --> 01:14:13.343
because I'm dying
to meet my nephew, Brody.


1078
01:14:13.475 --> 01:14:15.578
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Of course, you can meet him.


1079
01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:17.447
Um, and see 'em. Yeah.

1080
01:14:17.981 --> 01:14:20.583
Oh, God. I-I've seen
pictures of you before and--


1081
01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:22.452
and I know that you
were identical twins,


1082
01:14:22.585 --> 01:14:24.620
but to see you in person,
it's just,


1083
01:14:24.754 --> 01:14:26.956
it's crazy. Wow.

1084
01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:30.126
Yeah. Heh-- it used
to drive our friends crazy.


1085
01:14:32.061 --> 01:14:35.231
You know, I was gonna call
and schedule something,


1086
01:14:35.365 --> 01:14:37.967
but this just feels like a sign.

1087
01:14:38.101 --> 01:14:41.104
Is there any way
I could come over now?


1088
01:14:41.637 --> 01:14:43.406
Like right now, right now?

1089
01:14:43.539 --> 01:14:45.942
Yeah.
If that's-- if that's okay.


1090
01:14:46.075 --> 01:14:48.044
Oh, it-- it--
it's best to schedule it.


1091
01:14:48.177 --> 01:14:50.013
Um, you know what,
maybe instead on Saturday


1092
01:14:50.146 --> 01:14:51.681
we're having a block party
for Labor Day.


1093
01:14:51.814 --> 01:14:53.116
Maybe you can meet him then.

1094
01:14:53.249 --> 01:14:55.952
Oh, it's just,

1095
01:14:56.085 --> 01:14:58.921
it's gonna be my first time
meeting with Brody


1096
01:14:59.055 --> 01:15:01.657
and I really want
that moment to be private.


1097
01:15:01.791 --> 01:15:04.594
Please.
I-I will be super quick.


1098
01:15:05.528 --> 01:15:07.130
Please.

1099
01:15:10.533 --> 01:15:12.702
Yeah. Um, sure.
Why not?


1100
01:15:12.835 --> 01:15:14.804
Okay.
Are you ready now?


1101
01:15:14.937 --> 01:15:17.607
-Um, yeah. I'm ready.
-I'm just gonna leave those.


1102
01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.108
Okay.

1103
01:15:23.012 --> 01:15:25.381
Hey, honey.

1104
01:15:25.515 --> 01:15:28.217
You won't believe
who I ran into at the store,


1105
01:15:28.351 --> 01:15:29.819
and she's here to see Brody.

1106
01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:34.924
This is, uh, Fabiola.
Fiona's twin sister.


1107
01:15:36.192 --> 01:15:37.260
Twin sister.

1108
01:15:37.393 --> 01:15:38.895
Hi.
Nice to meet you.


1109
01:15:49.972 --> 01:15:51.674
Nice to meet you as well.

1110
01:15:51.808 --> 01:15:53.776
Caleb never mentioned
she had a twin.


1111
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:55.611
Oh, well, I'm sorry to intrude.

1112
01:15:55.745 --> 01:15:58.581
I told Caleb I've been meaning
to come by and meet the baby,


1113
01:15:58.714 --> 01:16:01.384
and I just,
I-I couldn't wait anymore.


1114
01:16:01.517 --> 01:16:03.753
Yeah.
Well, he's over there.


1115
01:16:05.688 --> 01:16:07.190
-Can I?
-Yeah.


1116
01:16:08.124 --> 01:16:09.692
Oh, you're cute.

1117
01:16:11.894 --> 01:16:14.063
Hi, baby Brody.

1118
01:16:14.197 --> 01:16:15.731
Oh my gosh.

1119
01:16:17.467 --> 01:16:19.936
He's the last thing
I have left of my sister.


1120
01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:23.873
I promise you,
I'm gonna be the best <i>tia</i> ever.


1121
01:16:24.006 --> 01:16:25.942
I'm gonna have these
all the time.


1122
01:16:26.075 --> 01:16:28.177
I'm gonna take all your photos.

1123
01:16:30.379 --> 01:16:31.747
He's so beautiful.

1124
01:16:33.516 --> 01:16:34.951
Is the baby asleep?

1125
01:16:35.552 --> 01:16:36.619
Yep.

1126
01:16:37.386 --> 01:16:40.189
I'm sorry for how I went down
today with, uh, Fabiola.


1127
01:16:41.057 --> 01:16:44.193
It's just we already have
the mother and the aunt,


1128
01:16:44.327 --> 01:16:45.728
and now the sister.

1129
01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:47.864
And you never told me
that she had a twin.


1130
01:16:47.997 --> 01:16:49.600
Well, look, she has a twin,
and now, you know.


1131
01:16:49.732 --> 01:16:52.869
And I understand why you're
upset, but this is family.


1132
01:16:53.002 --> 01:16:54.403
It isn't family.

1133
01:16:54.538 --> 01:16:56.172
Not your family. 
Not my family.

1134
01:16:56.305 --> 01:16:59.041
It's Brody's family,
and you can't change that.


1135
01:16:59.175 --> 01:17:01.043
I know, but do they have to be
so involved?


1136
01:17:01.177 --> 01:17:03.446
Brody is the only thing
they have left from Fiona.


1137
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:07.250
Oh God! Yes. I know. I know.
I hear about it all the--


1138
01:17:07.383 --> 01:17:08.885
Hey, hey.
Lower your voice, okay?


1139
01:17:09.018 --> 01:17:10.486
The neighbors
are gonna hear you.


1140
01:17:10.621 --> 01:17:13.289
Oh, I'm so sorry
if I'm interrupting!


1141
01:17:16.726 --> 01:17:19.530
Listen, I invited Fabiola
to the block party tomorrow.


1142
01:17:19.929 --> 01:17:21.831
What?
Why would you do that?


1143
01:17:21.964 --> 01:17:24.500
Doesn't she have anything
else to do?


1144
01:17:25.067 --> 01:17:27.236
I know that this doesn't
occur to you,


1145
01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:29.238
but seeing her,

1146
01:17:29.372 --> 01:17:31.774
seeing her face
reminds me of losing you


1147
01:17:31.908 --> 01:17:33.042
and everything else
that went down.


1148
01:17:33.176 --> 01:17:35.344
I know.
And I'm sorry for that.


1149
01:17:35.478 --> 01:17:38.814
And... she looks just like her.

1150
01:17:38.948 --> 01:17:41.884
So, yeah, it's making
me feel a little uneasy.


1151
01:17:43.819 --> 01:17:46.322
You and I are back together.

1152
01:17:46.455 --> 01:17:49.325
Okay?
And you're Brody's mom now.


1153
01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:52.128
You're right.

1154
01:17:53.429 --> 01:17:57.200
This is our second chance,
and I don't wanna ruin that.


1155
01:17:58.935 --> 01:18:00.269
And maybe just, maybe

1156
01:18:00.403 --> 01:18:02.438
we can get married
again in the future.


1157
01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:08.211
-You mean that?
-Yes, I mean it.


1158
01:18:09.745 --> 01:18:11.214
Caleb.

1159
01:18:15.318 --> 01:18:17.086
All right?

1160
01:18:17.486 --> 01:18:20.156
Now let's relax
and enjoy our drinks.


1161
01:18:25.061 --> 01:18:26.597
Okay. You wanna put him
in the playpen?


1162
01:18:26.729 --> 01:18:28.097
Yeah. Oh, baby.

1163
01:18:28.231 --> 01:18:29.966
-He's tired.
-Come here.


1164
01:18:30.099 --> 01:18:32.168
Come here, Brody.

1165
01:18:32.301 --> 01:18:35.171
I'll show you pictures of your
mother another day, Brody.


1166
01:18:49.252 --> 01:18:51.854
Hey, Celine, can you please come
back here when you get a chance?


1167
01:18:53.055 --> 01:18:54.490
Yeah.

1168
01:18:58.961 --> 01:19:00.229
Here, sit down.

1169
01:19:01.063 --> 01:19:02.331
Yeah. Okay.

1170
01:19:03.933 --> 01:19:05.968
What did you do
with Fiona's pictures?


1171
01:19:07.169 --> 01:19:10.973
Oh, um, that's right.

1172
01:19:12.775 --> 01:19:13.843
Here.

1173
01:19:14.678 --> 01:19:17.213
Why did you make another booklet
with your pictures in it?


1174
01:19:19.048 --> 01:19:20.684
Excuse me?

1175
01:19:20.816 --> 01:19:22.619
Celine, we both agreed that
you're gonna be Brody's mother,


1176
01:19:22.753 --> 01:19:25.021
but the reason I did this
is so that he can see


1177
01:19:25.154 --> 01:19:26.889
his mother
and remember who she was.


1178
01:19:29.526 --> 01:19:31.227
This has been
hard on me too, Caleb.


1179
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.062
Yeah, but this isn't about you.

1180
01:19:33.195 --> 01:19:35.064
You know what?
You never think about how I feel


1181
01:19:35.197 --> 01:19:36.832
or what I've been through.

1182
01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:41.772
Oh my God!

1183
01:19:58.588 --> 01:20:00.256
-Which one would you like?
-I want that one!


1184
01:20:00.389 --> 01:20:02.659
-I want that one!
-That one! I want that one!


1185
01:20:02.793 --> 01:20:04.160
-This one?
-Thank you.


1186
01:20:04.293 --> 01:20:05.995
-You're welcome.
-Yay!


1187
01:20:07.029 --> 01:20:08.497
You want a little turtle?

1188
01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:17.808
I want cotton candy.

1189
01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:20.276
Okay. Here, honey.
Thanks.


1190
01:20:20.409 --> 01:20:22.411
Yeah. I'll get a punch bowl
for the drink table.


1191
01:20:22.546 --> 01:20:24.213
What do you think?
Strawberry or orange?


1192
01:20:24.347 --> 01:20:26.148
Uh, either one should be fine.

1193
01:20:26.282 --> 01:20:27.883
Oh, and the balloon lady wanted
a bottle of water earlier.


1194
01:20:28.017 --> 01:20:29.553
I totally forgot
to give it to her.


1195
01:20:29.686 --> 01:20:31.253
Can you bring it to her
while they go and get the ice?


1196
01:20:31.387 --> 01:20:32.988
Sure thing.
You know, random thought.


1197
01:20:33.122 --> 01:20:35.057
I was thinking,
why on earth was I not invited


1198
01:20:35.191 --> 01:20:36.560
to your baby shower?
I mean, gosh.


1199
01:20:36.693 --> 01:20:38.427
-I know it was a long time ago--
-Time flies.


1200
01:20:38.562 --> 01:20:41.163
And you never mentioned
about the day you gave birth.


1201
01:20:41.297 --> 01:20:43.800
I mean, you know, us moms
love to indulge in the details.


1202
01:20:43.933 --> 01:20:45.468
Can we talk about this later?

1203
01:20:45.602 --> 01:20:47.203
The kids are lined up
around the block for some punch.


1204
01:20:47.336 --> 01:20:49.338
Okay, we'll catch up later.

1205
01:20:53.075 --> 01:20:55.378
Bitch.

1206
01:20:58.180 --> 01:20:59.683
Miguel, hey.

1207
01:20:59.816 --> 01:21:01.984
I know I haven't called.
I'm so sorry. It's rude of me.


1208
01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:03.553
I should have done it before,
but--


1209
01:21:03.687 --> 01:21:06.556
Don't be silly.
It's good to see you.


1210
01:21:06.922 --> 01:21:08.357
I heard you were in town

1211
01:21:08.491 --> 01:21:10.560
and wanted to know
what you were up to today.


1212
01:21:10.926 --> 01:21:13.295
Um, no real plans. Why?

1213
01:21:13.429 --> 01:21:16.365
Well, Fiona and I always spent
our holiday weekends together.


1214
01:21:16.499 --> 01:21:19.034
And I'd be lying if I said
you weren't the next best thing.


1215
01:21:19.168 --> 01:21:21.070
Thanks a lot.

1216
01:21:21.203 --> 01:21:22.572
Plus I haven't seen you
in forever.


1217
01:21:22.706 --> 01:21:24.841
Oh, you are so sweet.

1218
01:21:25.742 --> 01:21:27.811
You know what? I told Caleb
I would go to their block party.


1219
01:21:27.943 --> 01:21:31.514
Caleb? Wait, you met Caleb
and the baby already?


1220
01:21:31.648 --> 01:21:33.149
-Yeah.
-Oh, girl.


1221
01:21:33.282 --> 01:21:34.984
There's so much to catch up on.
Okay, go get ready.


1222
01:21:35.117 --> 01:21:36.252
-We're gonna be late.
-Okay.


1223
01:21:36.385 --> 01:21:38.087
Wait.
Uh, where are we going?


1224
01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:39.355
What should I wear?

1225
01:21:39.488 --> 01:21:40.423
-Oh.

1226
01:21:40.557 --> 01:21:43.259
I got you some lashes.
-Oh!


1227
01:21:43.392 --> 01:21:45.394
I was wondering if you
have a bikini to go with them.


1228
01:21:45.529 --> 01:21:47.664
- Hmm?
- Okay.


1229
01:21:47.798 --> 01:21:49.533
Maybe you can
help me pick something out?


1230
01:21:49.666 --> 01:21:51.133
-Yes.
-Okay.


1231
01:21:58.974 --> 01:22:00.276
I would like some.

1232
01:22:00.409 --> 01:22:02.011
Excuse me.
Can I get a beer, please?


1233
01:22:02.144 --> 01:22:04.180
- Oh, yeah. Of course.
- Thank you.


1234
01:22:10.119 --> 01:22:11.855
Mm, that's so strong.

1235
01:22:11.987 --> 01:22:13.690
-Oh, hey, Miguel.
-Hey!


1236
01:22:13.824 --> 01:22:15.324
Oh, girl, you look amazing.

1237
01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:16.760
-Thank you.
-Is all this real?


1238
01:22:16.893 --> 01:22:18.327
Everything but the lashes.

1239
01:22:18.461 --> 01:22:20.496
Okay. Okay.

1240
01:22:24.133 --> 01:22:25.602
Excuse me.

1241
01:22:25.735 --> 01:22:28.805
Get a strap on already. Ugh!

1242
01:22:28.939 --> 01:22:30.607
Never a dull moment, I swear.

1243
01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:33.375
Ooh, love this song.
Turn it up.


1244
01:22:39.114 --> 01:22:41.350
Ooh!

1245
01:22:46.121 --> 01:22:47.724
-Hey.
-Hey.


1246
01:22:57.834 --> 01:22:59.034
So you met the baby.

1247
01:22:59.168 --> 01:23:01.938
Yeah.
He's beautiful.


1248
01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:04.273
-Yeah.
-I already love him to death.


1249
01:23:07.309 --> 01:23:10.680
How have you been
dealing with everything?


1250
01:23:11.413 --> 01:23:13.249
Oh, Miguel.
It's been rough.


1251
01:23:13.683 --> 01:23:14.751
Yeah.

1252
01:23:17.486 --> 01:23:19.421
I just feel so guilty.

1253
01:23:19.556 --> 01:23:22.057
I can't believe
I wasn't there for her


1254
01:23:22.191 --> 01:23:24.360
-during her pregnancy.
-No.


1255
01:23:24.493 --> 01:23:27.196
I-I just wish I could have
been with her one more time.


1256
01:23:27.329 --> 01:23:29.098
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1257
01:23:30.499 --> 01:23:33.068
Fiona was the happiest
I had ever seen her.


1258
01:23:33.837 --> 01:23:35.839
I mean, she was
on her way to motherhood.


1259
01:23:35.972 --> 01:23:37.339
She had the man of her dreams.

1260
01:23:37.473 --> 01:23:40.209
And career-wise,
she was at the top of her game.


1261
01:23:41.343 --> 01:23:43.245
I mean,
that counts for something.


1262
01:23:44.246 --> 01:23:45.514
Yeah, it does.

1263
01:23:52.354 --> 01:23:54.256
I prefer you brunette.

1264
01:23:54.858 --> 01:23:56.225
What are you doing here?

1265
01:23:56.358 --> 01:23:59.194
This is a pleasant surprise.

1266
01:23:59.529 --> 01:24:01.130
Do you live close by?

1267
01:24:01.263 --> 01:24:02.832
It's none of your business.

1268
01:24:03.265 --> 01:24:04.568
Look at the balloons.

1269
01:24:06.570 --> 01:24:08.437
I miss Mama.

1270
01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.841
There you go.

1271
01:24:11.975 --> 01:24:13.475
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


1272
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:16.546
Yeah. You good?

1273
01:24:17.112 --> 01:24:20.550
If you have any
more business for me,


1274
01:24:21.483 --> 01:24:23.085
you know the number...

1275
01:24:24.621 --> 01:24:25.755
...pretty lady.

1276
01:24:25.889 --> 01:24:27.222
It was a one-time thing.

1277
01:24:27.356 --> 01:24:28.792
I'm not gonna need
your services again.


1278
01:24:28.925 --> 01:24:31.093
So just walk away

1279
01:24:31.226 --> 01:24:32.762
and pretend
like I don't know you.


1280
01:24:32.896 --> 01:24:36.098
Never... say never.

1281
01:24:49.211 --> 01:24:51.280
Hey. Hey, you okay?

1282
01:24:51.413 --> 01:24:52.716
Who was that
you were talking to?


1283
01:24:52.849 --> 01:24:54.651
Oh, he was just
looking for something.


1284
01:24:54.784 --> 01:24:56.720
I'm starving.
You guys ready to eat?


1285
01:24:56.853 --> 01:24:58.588
Yeah. That cheeseburger
calling my name.


1286
01:24:58.722 --> 01:25:00.456
Do you wanna take him
and I'll make us a plate?


1287
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:02.358
Yeah.
There you go.


1288
01:25:02.491 --> 01:25:04.460
Let's go.
Let's go get a hot dog.


1289
01:25:04.594 --> 01:25:07.764
Yeah, let's go get a hot dog.

1290
01:25:09.599 --> 01:25:11.768
Can I tell you something?

1291
01:25:11.901 --> 01:25:13.168
Yeah.

1292
01:25:16.472 --> 01:25:20.543
I have had this awful
feeling about her death.


1293
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:22.912
What do you mean?

1294
01:25:23.046 --> 01:25:25.115
My mom said that
after the labor she was fine.


1295
01:25:25.481 --> 01:25:26.850
Yeah, she was.

1296
01:25:27.651 --> 01:25:30.053
I don't know,
it just doesn't make any sense.


1297
01:25:30.954 --> 01:25:34.624
Something about her death
just feels... off.


1298
01:25:38.662 --> 01:25:40.295
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just trying to


1299
01:25:40.429 --> 01:25:42.331
find something
or someone to blame.


1300
01:25:43.365 --> 01:25:44.834
Well, you can't blame yourself.

1301
01:25:46.569 --> 01:25:48.203
It'll get better.

1302
01:25:52.441 --> 01:25:55.979
Hey, uh. Oh, Doctor,
you, um, you dropped this.


1303
01:25:56.378 --> 01:25:58.081
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


1304
01:26:14.831 --> 01:26:17.600
You know,
today really lifted my spirits.


1305
01:26:19.501 --> 01:26:22.404
I think Fiona would've liked
this: Us together.


1306
01:26:22.539 --> 01:26:24.641
I think so too.

1307
01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:26.442
Well, cheers to Fiona.

1308
01:26:27.443 --> 01:26:29.511
Cheers to our angel in heaven.

1309
01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:38.988
-Oh, no.
-What's wrong?


1310
01:26:40.857 --> 01:26:43.459
I just got promoted
to VP of Marketing.


1311
01:26:44.393 --> 01:26:46.796
Congratulations.
That's awesome.


1312
01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:50.299
-Why aren't you excited?
-Because they want me


1313
01:26:50.432 --> 01:26:52.168
to come into the office
for half the week.


1314
01:26:52.301 --> 01:26:53.469
Who's gonna watch the baby?

1315
01:26:53.837 --> 01:26:55.171
-I have to say no.
-What?


1316
01:26:55.304 --> 01:26:56.573
No. No. Celine...

1317
01:26:56.973 --> 01:26:59.142
you've been wanting this
for such a long time.


1318
01:26:59.274 --> 01:27:00.577
Yeah, but who's gonna
watch Brody?


1319
01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:02.344
You'll be home half the week.
Okay?


1320
01:27:02.478 --> 01:27:03.813
And I know you
don't wanna hear this,


1321
01:27:03.947 --> 01:27:06.015
but he's got
a family to watch him too.


1322
01:27:07.483 --> 01:27:08.918
-Yeah?
-Yeah.


1323
01:27:09.284 --> 01:27:12.722
Come on. He's gonna be
in good hands and you know that.


1324
01:27:13.156 --> 01:27:15.424
Celine, take the position.

1325
01:27:15.558 --> 01:27:16.860
You deserve it.

1326
01:27:18.427 --> 01:27:20.462
It'll be a significant
pay increase.


1327
01:27:20.597 --> 01:27:22.098
And I would finally
be able to manage


1328
01:27:22.232 --> 01:27:24.567
-the direction of the company.
-There you go.


1329
01:27:24.701 --> 01:27:26.435
And maybe after a year,

1330
01:27:26.569 --> 01:27:29.005
they'd allow me to pick
and choose the hours I come in.


1331
01:27:29.539 --> 01:27:32.307
You really think he'll be okay?

1332
01:27:32.441 --> 01:27:33.843
I'm positive.

1333
01:27:36.045 --> 01:27:37.113
Alright.

1334
01:27:37.513 --> 01:27:39.916
I'm gonna say yes.

1335
01:27:42.585 --> 01:27:44.286
Sent.

1336
01:27:44.419 --> 01:27:46.288
Awesome. All right.
Let's go to dinner.


1337
01:27:46.421 --> 01:27:47.757
I'll coordinate with the family

1338
01:27:47.891 --> 01:27:49.159
and I'll text you
Fabiola's number, okay?


1339
01:27:49.859 --> 01:27:52.494
Um, why would I need
Fabiola's number?


1340
01:27:52.862 --> 01:27:54.531
Well, she's gonna
be excited to watch him.


1341
01:27:54.664 --> 01:27:55.932
She's part of the family.

1342
01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.502
Mmm! So proud of you.

1343
01:28:09.212 --> 01:28:10.880
Wow.

1344
01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.448
This is her last collection.

1345
01:28:15.218 --> 01:28:16.986
It's beautiful, Miguel.

1346
01:28:21.456 --> 01:28:23.993
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
Can I take photos?


1347
01:28:24.127 --> 01:28:25.528
I wanted to show my mom.

1348
01:28:25.662 --> 01:28:28.064
Of course.
Just don't show anyone else.


1349
01:28:28.198 --> 01:28:29.532
You got it.

1350
01:28:29.666 --> 01:28:31.333
This collection's
gonna be such a hit.


1351
01:28:31.466 --> 01:28:33.002
And wait 'til
you see the men's line.


1352
01:28:33.136 --> 01:28:35.337
New York Fashion Week is
two and a half months away.


1353
01:28:35.705 --> 01:28:37.140
And in honor of Fiona,

1354
01:28:37.273 --> 01:28:38.908
the industry's
decided to give her an award.


1355
01:28:39.809 --> 01:28:41.110
I was wondering
if you could be there


1356
01:28:41.244 --> 01:28:42.679
to accept it on her behalf.

1357
01:28:45.414 --> 01:28:47.851
We're also gonna be
featured in <i>Harper's Bazaar,</i>


1358
01:28:47.984 --> 01:28:50.887
and I'll need to book a couple
photographers for that shoot.


1359
01:28:51.353 --> 01:28:53.289
-Are you available?
-For this?


1360
01:28:53.422 --> 01:28:55.658
-Absolutely.
-Oh, fantastic.


1361
01:28:55.959 --> 01:28:58.261
I'm also gonna invite the family
and Caleb


1362
01:28:58.393 --> 01:28:59.596
to New York Fashion Week.

1363
01:28:59.729 --> 01:29:01.164
I think it could be a good idea.

1364
01:29:01.297 --> 01:29:03.233
-Miguel, they would love that.
-Okay. Great.


1365
01:29:03.365 --> 01:29:05.602
My assistant booked
a block of rooms at the hotel,


1366
01:29:05.735 --> 01:29:07.337
so just give me
confirmation on who can come.


1367
01:29:07.469 --> 01:29:09.672
-I'm on it.
-Great.


1368
01:29:11.307 --> 01:29:12.407
Can I ask you a favor?

1369
01:29:12.542 --> 01:29:13.810
Yeah.

1370
01:29:16.179 --> 01:29:18.748
Do you think after
the show I could keep one?


1371
01:29:19.549 --> 01:29:20.950
Consider it done.

1372
01:29:25.355 --> 01:29:27.724
Yeah. Yeah.

1373
01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:31.828
Hey, baby Brody

1374
01:29:31.961 --> 01:29:33.395
- Brody, look who's here.
- Hi.


1375
01:29:33.529 --> 01:29:35.665
-Look who's here.
-Hello.


1376
01:29:36.366 --> 01:29:37.700
Oh.

1377
01:29:38.134 --> 01:29:40.370
Look who's here-- oh!

1378
01:29:40.502 --> 01:29:41.638
Thanks for coming.

1379
01:29:41.771 --> 01:29:44.406
I could use some fresh air.

1380
01:29:49.444 --> 01:29:51.948
-And it's such a beautiful day.
-It is.


1381
01:29:53.482 --> 01:29:54.851
So what were you up to today?

1382
01:29:54.984 --> 01:29:58.054
Oh, I was just at the studio
with Miguel.


1383
01:29:58.721 --> 01:30:00.623
Oh, by the way,
uh, you and the family


1384
01:30:00.757 --> 01:30:02.225
are invited
to New York Fashion Week.


1385
01:30:02.358 --> 01:30:04.761
They're gonna be honoring
my sister with an award


1386
01:30:04.894 --> 01:30:07.130
and I'm gonna be there
to accept it on her behalf.


1387
01:30:07.263 --> 01:30:09.132
Nice! Yeah, send me the dates.

1388
01:30:09.265 --> 01:30:10.600
Yeah.

1389
01:30:10.733 --> 01:30:12.168
Are you--
are you a designer as well?


1390
01:30:12.302 --> 01:30:14.103
No, no.

1391
01:30:14.237 --> 01:30:16.505
I love clothes,
but I can't make 'em.


1392
01:30:16.639 --> 01:30:18.107
I don't even know how to sew.

1393
01:30:19.441 --> 01:30:21.077
Um, but I am in the industry.

1394
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:23.379
I thought so.
I just wasn't sure.


1395
01:30:23.846 --> 01:30:25.882
I'm a fashion photographer.

1396
01:30:26.015 --> 01:30:27.216
Oh, nice. Yeah.

1397
01:30:27.617 --> 01:30:29.118
And speaking of,

1398
01:30:29.252 --> 01:30:32.155
I have yet to take pictures
of this little guy.


1399
01:30:32.288 --> 01:30:33.890
-Oh.
-Hi.


1400
01:30:34.724 --> 01:30:37.126
Hi, baby.

1401
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.895
Oh, wow.

1402
01:30:39.028 --> 01:30:41.230
Yeah. You're a natural.

1403
01:30:42.932 --> 01:30:44.267
You know what, Brody,
if you get the height,


1404
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.535
we're gonna put you to work.

1405
01:30:45.668 --> 01:30:47.770
Oh, yes, we will.

1406
01:30:48.237 --> 01:30:49.305
Oh, hey. Hold that.

1407
01:30:49.639 --> 01:30:50.505
Hmm?

1408
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.541
Oh.

1409
01:30:52.909 --> 01:30:54.577
You have a really nice features.

1410
01:30:54.711 --> 01:30:56.012
Thank you.

1411
01:30:56.145 --> 01:30:57.613
I, um, I guess
I missed my calling.


1412
01:30:57.747 --> 01:30:59.349
Maybe.

1413
01:30:59.514 --> 01:31:00.416
Here. Brody.

1414
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:01.951
Hi, baby.

1415
01:31:02.919 --> 01:31:04.420
Can-- can I see that?

1416
01:31:04.554 --> 01:31:05.822
Yeah.

1417
01:31:07.156 --> 01:31:10.126
Oh, wow. These are--
these are pretty amazing.


1418
01:31:11.761 --> 01:31:13.262
Maybe I could be
in the next top model, huh?


1419
01:31:13.396 --> 01:31:15.465
Maybe you can.

1420
01:31:15.598 --> 01:31:17.400
I'll-
- I'll call around for you.

1421
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:22.005
Well, this is a first for me.

1422
01:31:22.138 --> 01:31:24.273
I've never had pizza
delivered at the park before.


1423
01:31:28.578 --> 01:31:30.079
Wow.
This is surreal.


1424
01:31:30.213 --> 01:31:31.280
What is?

1425
01:31:33.349 --> 01:31:37.253
I mean, I'm here with
my sister's baby and with you,


1426
01:31:39.222 --> 01:31:40.957
but she's not with us.

1427
01:31:41.724 --> 01:31:43.393
Yeah. I could've, um,

1428
01:31:43.526 --> 01:31:45.895
never imagined it would've
turned out this way.


1429
01:31:46.029 --> 01:31:47.964
This must be so hard for you.

1430
01:31:49.065 --> 01:31:50.133
And for you too.

1431
01:31:51.834 --> 01:31:54.070
Yeah.

1432
01:31:55.638 --> 01:31:57.407
I'm sorry, I-I gotta get this.
Okay?


1433
01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:58.808
Of course.

1434
01:31:59.242 --> 01:32:00.243
Hello?

1435
01:32:00.376 --> 01:32:01.644
Yes. This is Caleb.

1436
01:32:05.715 --> 01:32:07.116
What?

1437
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:08.985
No, no, no.
The-- the owner of the building


1438
01:32:09.118 --> 01:32:10.753
told me it was
an electrical shortage.


1439
01:32:13.723 --> 01:32:14.991
Are you sure?

1440
01:32:15.992 --> 01:32:19.162
Please, if you find out
anything else, let me know.


1441
01:32:34.343 --> 01:32:35.378
Is everything okay?

1442
01:32:36.112 --> 01:32:38.247
That was an arson investigator.

1443
01:32:38.381 --> 01:32:40.650
He said that the fire
at Fiona's baby shower


1444
01:32:40.783 --> 01:32:42.318
was due to arson.

1445
01:32:43.219 --> 01:32:44.754
I told him,
"No, you must be confused


1446
01:32:44.887 --> 01:32:46.989
because the owner
of the building told me


1447
01:32:47.123 --> 01:32:48.991
that it was an electrical
shortage."


1448
01:32:51.727 --> 01:32:53.629
And he said
that I was misinformed.


1449
01:32:54.597 --> 01:32:55.865
Oh my God.

1450
01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:59.335
Oh my God.
I just got chills.


1451
01:32:59.469 --> 01:33:01.237
And that there's no leads and...

1452
01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:04.307
that the case might
come to a close.


1453
01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:07.310
Wait. So do they think
it was, like, a fluke thing?


1454
01:33:07.443 --> 01:33:08.711
Like an accident?

1455
01:33:08.845 --> 01:33:10.813
Or they think
it was intentional?


1456
01:33:10.947 --> 01:33:13.116
No.
Uh, arson is no accident.


1457
01:33:13.249 --> 01:33:16.052
I know, but that
doesn't make any sense.


1458
01:33:16.185 --> 01:33:18.888
I mean, who would do something
like that intentionally,


1459
01:33:19.021 --> 01:33:21.224
and at a baby shower no less?

1460
01:33:23.359 --> 01:33:24.994
I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.


1461
01:33:26.195 --> 01:33:27.630
<i>It does seem odd,</i>

1462
01:33:27.763 --> 01:33:29.398
<i>but it's not exactly proof.</i>

1463
01:33:29.533 --> 01:33:32.802
<i>If she was behind this,</i>
<i>you'll find out eventually.</i>


1464
01:33:32.935 --> 01:33:35.071
<i>But I don't know, man.</i>
<i>Arson?</i>


1465
01:33:35.204 --> 01:33:36.906
<i>Doesn't sound like Celine.</i>

1466
01:33:37.039 --> 01:33:38.808
Well, she vandalized
her house during that time.


1467
01:33:38.941 --> 01:33:41.811
She was--
she was acting pretty crazy.


1468
01:33:41.944 --> 01:33:44.413
Allen] <i>Yeah. You both</i>
<i>have been through a lot.</i>


1469
01:33:44.548 --> 01:33:48.818
I wouldn't stir the pot unless
it's absolutely necessary.


1470
01:33:48.951 --> 01:33:51.187
Yeah. Yeah. You're right, man.
Thanks.


1471
01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.589
All right.
We'll talk later, okay?


1472
01:34:13.676 --> 01:34:15.311
Any movement,
make the call out.


1473
01:34:15.444 --> 01:34:16.746
Copy that.

1474
01:34:31.227 --> 01:34:34.964
Do not drop.
Do not drop.


1475
01:34:35.865 --> 01:34:37.133
Damn it!

1476
01:34:40.937 --> 01:34:45.074
Suspect has fled
in a black vehicle headed south.


1477
01:35:01.390 --> 01:35:03.226
Yeah, we--
we've been over this.


1478
01:35:03.359 --> 01:35:05.027
<i>Can you come back early?</i>

1479
01:35:05.161 --> 01:35:06.663
<i>Why spend</i>
<i>two extra days in New York?</i>


1480
01:35:06.796 --> 01:35:08.998
Because I could really
use the break.


1481
01:35:09.566 --> 01:35:11.934
I invited you to come,
and you still can.


1482
01:35:15.404 --> 01:35:18.407
What? What was that?
It's really loud in here.


1483
01:35:18.542 --> 01:35:19.875
- I love you.
- I love you too.


1484
01:35:20.009 --> 01:35:21.477
We'll talk soon. Okay?

1485
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:27.850
Ooh, those are great.

1486
01:35:27.984 --> 01:35:30.219
-Yes. Ah!
-Nice. Huh?


1487
01:35:30.353 --> 01:35:31.954
-I love that one.
-Yeah.


1488
01:35:32.255 --> 01:35:33.889
Ooh,
I think they're ready for us.


1489
01:35:34.023 --> 01:35:35.424
Oh, okay.

1490
01:35:35.559 --> 01:35:36.859
Alright. Well,
we're gonna head backstage,


1491
01:35:36.993 --> 01:35:38.461
-but enjoy the show.
-I will.


1492
01:35:50.072 --> 01:35:51.340
There you are.
There you are. Okay.


1493
01:35:51.474 --> 01:35:53.342
Um, male model,
I forgot his name.


1494
01:35:53.476 --> 01:35:55.278
-Um, number three--
-What? Spit it out.


1495
01:35:55.411 --> 01:35:57.581
-He didn't show up.
-And you're telling me this now?


1496
01:35:57.714 --> 01:35:59.716
I think he's hungover
from last night or something.


1497
01:35:59.882 --> 01:36:01.284
I don't care.
What about Eric?


1498
01:36:01.417 --> 01:36:03.119
-Can't he just--
-No, we tried that.


1499
01:36:03.252 --> 01:36:04.621
He's first in their segment
and it's not gonna work.


1500
01:36:05.221 --> 01:36:06.889
-Fabiola?
-Yes.


1501
01:36:07.023 --> 01:36:09.025
Male model, waist size 32.
Do you know anyone?


1502
01:36:09.158 --> 01:36:10.761
We need him in makeup
in five minutes.


1503
01:36:11.294 --> 01:36:13.996
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right back.


1504
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:16.432
-Go do something.
-Okay.


1505
01:36:19.068 --> 01:36:21.971
Hey, um, could I actually
borrow you for a minute?


1506
01:36:22.104 --> 01:36:23.172
-Yeah, of course.
-Okay.


1507
01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:25.542
Um, are you guys
sure you want me?


1508
01:36:25.676 --> 01:36:27.243
I
-I am not a model.

1509
01:36:27.376 --> 01:36:30.012
You can pretend to be.
And don't be so stiff. Relax.


1510
01:36:30.146 --> 01:36:31.581
They'll show you how to do it.

1511
01:36:31.715 --> 01:36:33.182
-Just good call, Fabiola.
-You'll be great.


1512
01:36:33.316 --> 01:36:35.084
-Shot?
-Yes, please.


1513
01:36:35.752 --> 01:36:36.986
-Cheers.
-Cheers.


1514
01:36:39.388 --> 01:36:40.724
Oh God.

1515
01:36:41.257 --> 01:36:43.627
God, that's strong.

1516
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:44.827
-Oh my God.
-Showtime.


1517
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.295
Okay, let's go.
You ready?


1518
01:36:46.996 --> 01:36:48.297
Okay.

1519
01:36:49.031 --> 01:36:50.232
God, I hope he doesn't trip.

1520
01:38:20.557 --> 01:38:23.092
For the most
innovative, creative,


1521
01:38:23.225 --> 01:38:25.862
and inspiring fashions
of the year,


1522
01:38:25.995 --> 01:38:27.864
I present Miguel Munoz

1523
01:38:27.997 --> 01:38:32.134
and the late Fiona Hernandez
of Spark Fashion Line,


1524
01:38:32.268 --> 01:38:36.105
this award
for Designer of the Year.


1525
01:38:36.673 --> 01:38:39.375
Fiona's sister,
Fabiola Hernandez


1526
01:38:39.508 --> 01:38:41.277
is here to accept the award.

1527
01:38:45.782 --> 01:38:47.183
Thank you.

1528
01:38:50.921 --> 01:38:54.825
Oh my God. I-I was so
nervous, but I-I did my best.


1529
01:38:54.957 --> 01:38:57.694
Oh, I know. I was like, who is
that coming outta nowhere?


1530
01:38:57.828 --> 01:39:00.229
-You were fantastic.
-You did so great.


1531
01:39:00.362 --> 01:39:02.465
Yeah. And you picked
up that walk so fast.


1532
01:39:02.599 --> 01:39:04.433
-Thank you.
-Oh, you were fierce.


1533
01:39:06.636 --> 01:39:07.838
Good evening.

1534
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:10.105
This show was fantastic.

1535
01:39:10.239 --> 01:39:11.575
Thank you.

1536
01:39:11.708 --> 01:39:12.943
It was phenomenal.

1537
01:39:13.075 --> 01:39:15.110
Let's set up something.
Let's talk.


1538
01:39:15.244 --> 01:39:16.278
Of-- of course.

1539
01:39:16.412 --> 01:39:17.980
Have a wonderful night.

1540
01:39:18.113 --> 01:39:19.381
- Thank you.
- You too.


1541
01:39:23.085 --> 01:39:25.120
I think I'm gonna faint.

1542
01:39:25.254 --> 01:39:27.724
-Oh, my God!
-What? Who was that?


1543
01:39:29.058 --> 01:39:30.292
Frederic Raphael.

1544
01:39:30.426 --> 01:39:31.595
What--

1545
01:39:31.728 --> 01:39:33.697
He's one of the hottest
designers right now.


1546
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:36.666
The hottest. Oh my gosh.
Well, this is unreal.


1547
01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.868
Amazing.

1548
01:40:21.076 --> 01:40:22.679
Okay.

1549
01:40:22.812 --> 01:40:26.348
This guy is officially obsessed
with the Hernandez family.


1550
01:40:28.919 --> 01:40:29.819
Mm.

1551
01:40:29.953 --> 01:40:31.220
Damn!

1552
01:40:57.614 --> 01:40:59.749
That was a nice hotel, huh?

1553
01:40:59.883 --> 01:41:01.150
Yeah.

1554
01:41:02.619 --> 01:41:04.353
I'm really glad you came out.

1555
01:41:04.486 --> 01:41:06.422
I had a great time
with the show and--


1556
01:41:06.556 --> 01:41:08.424
-and getting to know you.
-Yeah, me too.


1557
01:41:08.558 --> 01:41:10.860
I'm definitely gonna add,
uh, modeling to my resume now.


1558
01:41:13.462 --> 01:41:15.832
This is one of the best weekends
I've had in a long time.


1559
01:41:16.198 --> 01:41:18.702
Yeah.
Just wish it didn't have to end.


1560
01:41:19.903 --> 01:41:21.337
Yeah.

1561
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:23.773
Um, so, you know,
maybe we can do some lunch


1562
01:41:23.907 --> 01:41:25.474
or coffee back in LA?

1563
01:41:26.042 --> 01:41:28.344
Yeah.
And you'd bring Brody.


1564
01:41:28.477 --> 01:41:29.879
Yeah.
He would love that.


1565
01:41:32.716 --> 01:41:35.051
Oh, it looks
like that's your taxi.


1566
01:41:35.184 --> 01:41:36.786
Yeah.
Alright. Well, I'll--


1567
01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.120
I'll see you back.

1568
01:41:38.253 --> 01:41:39.823
Um, have a safe flight.
Okay?


1569
01:41:39.956 --> 01:41:41.625
Okay. You too.

1570
01:41:53.202 --> 01:41:54.638
I couldn't be happier.

1571
01:41:54.771 --> 01:41:56.472
I mean, sales
are already through the roof.


1572
01:41:56.606 --> 01:41:58.307
I know. Ever since
the photo shoot was published,


1573
01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.376
I've been getting
calls from all over.


1574
01:42:00.509 --> 01:42:02.112
Right on, girlfriend.

1575
01:42:06.281 --> 01:42:07.684
Okay.
Now for the nitty gritty.


1576
01:42:07.817 --> 01:42:09.485
What the fuck
is up with you and Caleb?


1577
01:42:09.853 --> 01:42:12.589
I can't even believe I'm having
this conversation right now.


1578
01:42:13.123 --> 01:42:15.659
Oh my God, this is so weird.

1579
01:42:15.792 --> 01:42:18.427
Okay. First of all,
you cannot tell anyone.


1580
01:42:18.561 --> 01:42:20.764
You sound like Fiona.

1581
01:42:20.897 --> 01:42:23.800
Oh my God. I know. We always
had the same taste in men.


1582
01:42:23.933 --> 01:42:25.334
I remember, girl.

1583
01:42:25.869 --> 01:42:29.171
Look, but the second thing is,
I am not seeing him, okay?


1584
01:42:29.304 --> 01:42:33.877
I am not about to let this guy
have an ongoing affair again.


1585
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:36.613
That chick better
have a side piece by now.


1586
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:39.348
He's a catch.

1587
01:42:39.783 --> 01:42:42.251
I can see why my sister
was hung up on him.


1588
01:42:44.453 --> 01:42:46.990
This is like the never-ending
soap opera.


1589
01:42:47.123 --> 01:42:49.458
I mean, what is this guy's
dick made of? Gold?


1590
01:42:49.592 --> 01:42:53.328
-Hey, I did not sleep with him.
-Yet.


1591
01:42:56.066 --> 01:42:57.767
Deja fucking vu.

1592
01:43:01.071 --> 01:43:02.772
So how's that new position
at work coming along?


1593
01:43:02.906 --> 01:43:05.809
Uh, it's demanding
and challenging at times.


1594
01:43:05.942 --> 01:43:09.045
But the, uh, creative freedom
makes it enjoyable.


1595
01:43:09.179 --> 01:43:10.212
Nice.

1596
01:43:12.148 --> 01:43:13.616
You want seconds?

1597
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:15.051
Yeah, sure.

1598
01:43:15.185 --> 01:43:17.453
I mean, well, I'm a little full,
but yeah, why not?


1599
01:43:17.587 --> 01:43:18.988
These are really good.

1600
01:43:19.122 --> 01:43:21.157
Thank you, sweetie.
I appreciate it. Okay?


1601
01:43:21.523 --> 01:43:23.425
<i>And now for our top story.</i>

1602
01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.929
<i>A local doctor makes America's</i>

1603

1604
01:43:28.064 --> 01:43:31.101

1609
01:43:44.147 --> 01:43:45.682
Are you hearing this?

1610
01:43:46.448 --> 01:43:48.383
That doctor
is wanted for murder.


1611
01:43:49.219 --> 01:43:50.720
That's terrible.

1612
01:43:51.054 --> 01:43:53.723
Yeah.
He murdered one of his patients.


1613
01:43:54.591 --> 01:43:57.292
And it's at the same hospital
that Brody was born at.


1614
01:43:58.161 --> 01:43:59.361
Was he an obstetrician?

1615
01:43:59.796 --> 01:44:01.430
No, I don't-
- I don't think so.

1616
01:44:01.564 --> 01:44:04.266
But I feel like
I've seen him somewhere.


1617
01:44:05.168 --> 01:44:06.603
Really? Where?

1618
01:44:06.736 --> 01:44:09.973
I don't know.
He just looks really familiar.


1619
01:44:11.306 --> 01:44:12.809
That happened to me once.

1620
01:44:12.942 --> 01:44:16.378
I kept thinking that
I saw someone wanted for murder.


1621
01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:18.748
Strange how the mind works.

1622
01:44:19.849 --> 01:44:21.785
I was just hoping
you know that I saw him


1623
01:44:23.452 --> 01:44:25.655
'cause people like that
deserve to be caught.


1624
01:44:26.856 --> 01:44:28.892
What a crazy ass
world we live in.


1625
01:44:29.025 --> 01:44:31.694
-I hope they catch his ass.
-Me too.


1626
01:45:23.646 --> 01:45:25.380
Hey, babe.

1627
01:45:25.514 --> 01:45:26.783
Hey.

1628
01:45:27.984 --> 01:45:30.119
- Is he asleep?
- No, he's uh, with Elena.


1629
01:45:30.253 --> 01:45:32.188
- Oh.
- Come sit down.


1630
01:45:32.755 --> 01:45:34.691
Okay.

1631
01:45:35.692 --> 01:45:37.293
Oh, this looks amazing.

1632
01:45:37.426 --> 01:45:39.829
I love it when you cook.

1633
01:45:39.963 --> 01:45:43.867
May I?

1634
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.400
Yes, please.

1635
01:45:46.769 --> 01:45:48.004
Hmm.

1636
01:46:03.987 --> 01:46:05.054
Try some.

1637
01:46:12.795 --> 01:46:14.063
How do you like it?

1638
01:46:14.797 --> 01:46:16.532
It's delicious.

1639
01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:17.967
Okay.

1640
01:46:18.902 --> 01:46:21.604
Celine,

1641
01:46:23.706 --> 01:46:25.341
how do you know Dr. Smith?

1642
01:46:25.474 --> 01:46:28.912
Who?

1643
01:46:29.045 --> 01:46:30.713
Don't act stupid.

1644
01:46:31.814 --> 01:46:34.050
I-- I don't know
who you're talking about.


1645
01:46:34.183 --> 01:46:36.085
I want you to be honest.

1646
01:46:36.953 --> 01:46:39.155
I am.
I don't know a Dr. Smith.


1647
01:46:39.488 --> 01:46:40.823
Hmm.

1648
01:46:40.957 --> 01:46:42.592
He's the man
that's wanted for murder.


1649
01:46:42.725 --> 01:46:45.662
I saw you talking
to him at the block party.


1650
01:46:47.530 --> 01:46:49.732
Um, you lost me.

1651
01:46:50.366 --> 01:46:51.968
Cut the shit, Celine.

1652
01:46:52.635 --> 01:46:54.003
You were talking to him

1653
01:46:54.137 --> 01:46:56.239
and it wasn't
about fucking decorations.


1654
01:46:56.606 --> 01:46:59.943
He was the man wearing
the blue Hawaiian shirt.


1655
01:47:01.411 --> 01:47:04.614
Uh, that guy.
Um, yeah.


1656
01:47:04.747 --> 01:47:06.416
Uh, uh, he was looking
for something.


1657
01:47:06.549 --> 01:47:10.687
I remember him because he had
a bottle of wine for the booth.


1658
01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:12.755
I
-I don't remember him

1659
01:47:12.889 --> 01:47:15.124
and I certainly
didn't know he was a doctor.


1660
01:47:15.258 --> 01:47:17.026
He said something to you

1661
01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.797
and I noticed
because you gave him that look.


1662
01:47:21.898 --> 01:47:24.499
The same look
you're giving me right now.


1663
01:47:24.634 --> 01:47:27.670
So I'm gonna
ask you one more time.


1664
01:47:28.738 --> 01:47:31.240
How the fuck
do you know Dr. Smith?


1665
01:47:31.374 --> 01:47:32.842
I don't know him.

1666
01:47:33.576 --> 01:47:36.012
You're fucking lying to me.

1667
01:47:36.145 --> 01:47:38.480
Let me go, please. Stop.
Stop, Caleb.


1668
01:47:38.614 --> 01:47:39.882
You're not gonna leave this
house


1669
01:47:40.016 --> 01:47:41.784
until you
tell me the truth!


1670
01:47:41.918 --> 01:47:43.653
Caleb, please, let me go.
Please, let me go.


1671
01:47:43.786 --> 01:47:45.955
Please, let me go. Please.

1672
01:47:56.199 --> 01:47:57.867
What did you give me?

1673
01:47:58.735 --> 01:48:01.104
It's gonna wear off
in a few hours, okay?


1674
01:48:04.273 --> 01:48:05.475
You drugged me.

1675
01:48:05.608 --> 01:48:07.744
I'm sorry, baby.

1676
01:48:07.877 --> 01:48:10.213
Just tell me the truth.

1677
01:48:10.346 --> 01:48:11.748
Tell me what happened, okay?

1678
01:48:11.881 --> 01:48:14.817
And then we can
go pick up Brody.


1679
01:48:14.951 --> 01:48:16.219
Huh?

1680
01:48:17.787 --> 01:48:19.756
I didn't wanna do it.

1681
01:48:20.890 --> 01:48:25.028
I just wanted you back
and I wanted to have our baby.


1682
01:48:29.132 --> 01:48:31.567
I paid Dr. Smith
to take Fiona out.


1683
01:48:31.701 --> 01:48:35.838
I did it. I did it for us.

1684
01:48:35.972 --> 01:48:38.808
You are happy, Caleb.
I know that you are.


1685
01:48:38.941 --> 01:48:41.611
And-- and--
and it is in the past.


1686
01:48:41.744 --> 01:48:44.447
And I'm not a murderer.
I'm not a bad person.


1687
01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:46.649
Oh, Celine.

1688
01:48:48.351 --> 01:48:53.156
I'm so sorry
if I caused you to be this.


1689
01:48:53.656 --> 01:48:54.891
Untie me.

1690
01:48:55.024 --> 01:48:56.692
We don't have to tell anyone.

1691
01:48:56.826 --> 01:49:01.330
We can, um,
we can move past this.


1692
01:49:02.799 --> 01:49:03.900
And the fire?

1693
01:49:04.033 --> 01:49:06.903
I
-I didn't wanna hurt anyone.

1694
01:49:07.036 --> 01:49:08.504
I just wanted to scare them.

1695
01:49:14.277 --> 01:49:16.012
She was pregnant.

1696
01:49:17.413 --> 01:49:18.815
You could have killed my son.

1697
01:49:18.948 --> 01:49:22.819
You could have killed my son,
you crazy bitch.


1698
01:49:26.222 --> 01:49:27.657
Oh my God.

1699
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:31.127
You killed Fiona.
You killed my wife.


1700
01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:35.398
I'm your wife,
right here in front of you.


1701
01:49:35.798 --> 01:49:38.367
We have a beautiful family.

1702
01:49:39.635 --> 01:49:41.304
What was your plan, Celine?
Huh?


1703
01:49:41.437 --> 01:49:43.473
What do you think?
When they catch the doctor,


1704
01:49:43.606 --> 01:49:45.641
what do you think,
he wasn't gonna sell you out?


1705
01:49:45.775 --> 01:49:47.710
So what?
Are you gonna go to the police?


1706
01:49:49.245 --> 01:49:51.781
I am leaving,
and I'm taking Brody with me.


1707
01:49:51.914 --> 01:49:53.783
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Caleb.


1708
01:49:53.916 --> 01:49:55.318
Caleb, please.
You can't. You can't.


1709
01:49:55.451 --> 01:49:57.120
You can't take
Brody from me, please.


1710
01:49:57.253 --> 01:50:00.256
Please. I'm-- I'm--
I'm his mother. I'm his mother.


1711
01:50:00.389 --> 01:50:02.992
I'm sure he is gonna be
thrilled to learn


1712
01:50:03.126 --> 01:50:05.695
that his mother is no
longer here because of you!


1713
01:50:05.828 --> 01:50:08.931
I was taking my life back.

1714
01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.736
That bitch
got what she deserved.


1715
01:50:14.871 --> 01:50:16.939
You should rot in hell.

1716
01:50:17.073 --> 01:50:19.509
Caleb. Caleb, please.

1717
01:50:19.642 --> 01:50:22.945
You love me.
I know that you do.


1718
01:50:27.283 --> 01:50:28.918
How could I ever forgive you?

1719
01:50:29.051 --> 01:50:31.754
You murdered my angel.

1720
01:50:33.656 --> 01:50:35.358
So you're gonna tell her family?

1721
01:50:36.959 --> 01:50:40.963
No. And not because
I wanna save your sorry ass.


1722
01:50:41.097 --> 01:50:43.733
Because this would crush them.

1723
01:50:44.535 --> 01:50:46.068
I'm done with you.

1724
01:50:46.202 --> 01:50:49.839
I'm done
with everything, Celine.


1725
01:50:49.972 --> 01:50:54.545
No. No, no, no, no.

1726
01:50:54.677 --> 01:50:57.180
Caleb. Caleb. Caleb. Caleb.

1727
01:50:57.313 --> 01:51:00.883
Caleb! Caleb.
Caleb, please come back!


1728
01:51:01.017 --> 01:51:04.588
Caleb, no! No, Caleb, no.

1729
01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:08.491
No! No! No!

1730
01:51:08.625 --> 01:51:11.961
Caleb! Caleb!

1731
01:51:12.094 --> 01:51:15.865
Caleb, please
don't leave me alone.


1732
01:51:15.998 --> 01:51:18.034
Please don't
leave me alone, Caleb.


1733
01:51:18.167 --> 01:51:20.469
Please don't leave me alone.

1734
01:51:30.813 --> 01:51:32.583
Daddy, daddy,
look what I can do.


1735
01:51:32.715 --> 01:51:35.885
How about
we show your daddy outside?


1736
01:51:36.018 --> 01:51:37.753
Why?
Because I might break something?


1737
01:51:37.887 --> 01:51:39.322
-That's right, buttercup.
-Exactly.


1738
01:51:39.455 --> 01:51:42.058
-Good morning, sunshine.
-Good morning, baby.


1739
01:51:42.626 --> 01:51:44.427
Couldn't wait
to put on your costume, huh?


1740
01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:45.962
He is very excited.

1741
01:51:46.095 --> 01:51:47.598
Come on, Daddy.
Let's go play outside.


1742
01:51:47.730 --> 01:51:49.098
All right. You go first.
All right?


1743
01:51:49.232 --> 01:51:51.067
Remember what I taught you,
okay? Let's go.


1744
01:51:52.835 --> 01:51:55.338
You've been practicing.
Let's show Daddy.


1745
01:51:56.072 --> 01:51:58.040
Future champion right here.

1746
01:52:02.245 --> 01:52:03.714
All right, Brody, you ready?

1747
01:52:03.846 --> 01:52:04.981
Everything I've been teaching
you.


1748
01:52:05.114 --> 01:52:07.083
All right. Here we go. Let's go.

1749
01:52:08.517 --> 01:52:10.286
Yes. Good job. You see?

1750
01:52:10.419 --> 01:52:12.623
You got the-- you almost
got the spin right there.


1751
01:52:12.755 --> 01:52:13.856
-Good job!
-Here we go.


1752
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:16.092
Yes! Good job.

1753
01:52:20.062 --> 01:52:22.064
Yes! Yes. Good job.

1754
01:52:22.198 --> 01:52:23.799
Look, one-handed like daddy.

1755
01:52:23.933 --> 01:52:25.736
Oh, that takes
a little bit longer at practice.


1756
01:52:25.868 --> 01:52:27.069
Good job, dude.

1757
01:53:03.239 --> 01:53:07.143
<i>Oh, yes. Good job.</i>
<i>Here. Go catch. Oh, good catch.</i>


1758
01:53:07.276 --> 01:53:09.011
You're doing so good, Brody.

1759
01:53:09.145 --> 01:53:10.846
Yes. Just by the laces
like I taught you. Yes.


1760
01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:15.051
Daddy is showing off.

1761
01:53:15.184 --> 01:53:18.220
Yeah.
