00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:43.228
November 1958,

2
00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:45.480
my senior year of high school.

3
00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:47.816
While other girls were dancing to Elvis

4
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.401
and dreaming about prom dates,

5
00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:51.945
I was reading Jane Austen
and dreaming about college.


6
00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.907
And then my parents announced
we were moving to Cuba.


7
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.284
In a week.

8
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.130
Slamming doors and
giving the silent treatment


9
00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:11.423
couldn't change that,

10
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.217
but it was easier than admitting
I was really scared.


11
00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:16.011
At least everyone else was happy.

12
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.221
Dad got his big promotion from Ford,

13
00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:20.015
Mom got to travel in style

14
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.600
and Susie...

15
00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:24.436
I swear that girl
could adjust in a hurricane.

16
00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:30.127
Welcome to the Hotel Oceana.

17
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:55.193
Not too shabby.

18
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.947
Here's what I know about Cuba.

19
00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:01.366
My high school French
wasn't going to help me,


20
00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.410
I didn't know a single person,

21
00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:05.162
and though no one would talk about it,

22
00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:07.622
Fidel Castro was leading
the people in a revolution


23
00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:09.374
against President Batista.

24
00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:11.793
Not that you would
know it from this place.

25
00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:18.884
This is Cuba.
Nobody cares what you do here.


26
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.510
Susie, you want a smoke?

27
00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:23.388
Watch out for this one.
She's a bad influence.


28
00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:24.764
I'll take that as a compliment.

29
00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:27.559
She'll have you ditching classes in no time.

30
00:03:27.768 --> 00:03:30.896
As I recall, there's a certain someone
that likes to ditch them with me.


31
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.486
Don't forget to sign up for mambo lessons.
Mambo classes are held every day...


32
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.155
My God. June Cleaver is in Havana.

33
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.701
Actually, that's my sister Katey.
She's a real brain.


34
00:03:46.162 --> 00:03:47.162
Really?

35
00:03:47.914 --> 00:03:49.414
Yeah. She's probably going to Radcliffe.

36
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.124
What, majoring in fashion?

37
00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:55.086
Why don't you join us?

38
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.464
There's room here.

39
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.972
I'm James Phelps.

40
00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:07.265
Hi. Katey Miller.

41
00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:08.433
Pleasure to meet you.

42
00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:10.936
- Are you the...
- Yeah.


43
00:04:11.312 --> 00:04:12.395
Your dad works for my dad.

44
00:04:12.647 --> 00:04:13.772
Yeah.

45
00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:18.193
This is Sheila, Eve, 
Polly and Steph,

46
00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:19.986
and I guess you know Susie, right?

47
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:23.073
So, are you really going to Radcliffe?

48
00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:24.533
I won't know till spring.

49
00:04:24.784 --> 00:04:26.409
Watch out, girls.

50
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.163
I guess if your head's in your books,
you really don't have time


51
00:04:30.248 --> 00:04:32.457
to think about silly things like the weather.

52
00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:35.168
Chilly?

53
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.592
- Shit!
- I'm so sorry. It's my fault.


54
00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:44.761
No, just go get new drinks.

55
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.851
Stupid spic.

56
00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:57.399
Excuse me.

57
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:08.577
Excuse me. SeÃ±or?

58
00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:09.995
How may I help you, seÃ±orita?

59
00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:12.122
I knocked into those drinks.
I'd like to pay for them.


60
00:05:12.164 --> 00:05:13.540
That will not be necessary.

61
00:05:13.624 --> 00:05:15.500
Accidents happen. Excuse me.

62
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.424
I speak English.

63
00:05:23.968 --> 00:05:25.468
And I don't need your charity.

64
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:27.971
It's not.

65
00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:30.265
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

66
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.477
I'm sorry for what she called you.

67
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.438
- That was nothing.
- Not to me.


68
00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:38.023
Then why are you apologizing?

69
00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:48.742
You guys were so good.

70
00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:51.202
Your mother was good. I was...

71
00:05:51.662 --> 00:05:52.662
Okay.

72
00:05:53.706 --> 00:05:54.706
Dad?

73
00:05:56.584 --> 00:05:58.376
I'm sorry I haven't been

74
00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:00.879
excited about all of this.

75
00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:05.258
Sweetheart, it's okay.

76
00:06:05.843 --> 00:06:08.219
Senior year is a terrible time
to drag you out of school,


77
00:06:09.722 --> 00:06:11.264
especially when you're the star of the class.

78
00:06:11.474 --> 00:06:13.558
- Dad.
- Come on. Don't deny it.


79
00:06:14.393 --> 00:06:15.435
Be proud of it.

80
00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:17.979
You'll do great here, too.

81
00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:35.497
I can't stand on your feet anymore.

82
00:06:41.754 --> 00:06:43.713
Hey, you remembered that.

83
00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:46.800
Very good.

84
00:06:50.137 --> 00:06:52.055
Let's continue where we left off.

85
00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:54.724
Book 18, page 285.

86
00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:57.602
Katey, just do your best to
follow along, all right?


87
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.604
It's okay. I read it last year.

88
00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:02.107
Knock it off.

89
00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:05.860
Well, then perhaps you'd like
to begin reading at line 342.


90
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.615
"Now the suitors turned to dance and song,

91
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.201
"to the lovely beaten sway,

92
00:07:14.078 --> 00:07:16.788
"waiting for dusk to come upon them there,

93
00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:19.624
"and the dark night came upon them

94
00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.292
"lost in pleasure."

95
00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:29.134
Can anyone tell us
the significance of this passage?


96
00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:31.636
It's a bunch of drunk guys doing it.

97
00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:38.476
Athena

98
00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:42.188
wants the suitors
to keep invading Odysseus' house


99
00:07:42.273 --> 00:07:44.607
so that he'll get
angry enough to kill them.

100
00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:46.651
And why does the goddess want that?

101
00:07:49.447 --> 00:07:52.240
She wants Odysseus to find his strength

102
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.826
and courage?

103
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:56.161
Very good.

104
00:08:12.928 --> 00:08:14.179
Need a ride home?

105
00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:20.268
No. I'm okay.
I got a lot of catching up to do.


106
00:08:21.604 --> 00:08:23.855
You know, a lot of girls
don't like to let on when they're smart.


107
00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:26.858
- I know. I shouldn't have said that.
- No. No, I like that.


108
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.819
I like that about you.

109
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:36.826
A bunch of us are going to our
country club on Saturday night.


110
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.080
There'll be a band. 
The music's pretty cool.

111
00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:44.709
Would you like to go with me?

112
00:08:46.295 --> 00:08:48.421
I really do have a
lot of work to do.

113
00:08:48.547 --> 00:08:49.756
On a Saturday night?

114
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.383
Wow.

115
00:08:53.594 --> 00:08:56.805
Come on. I'm sure even Homer
took some time off


116
00:08:56.889 --> 00:08:58.640
between The lliad and The Odyssey.

117
00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:02.560
Well, sure. Okay.

118
00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:04.521
Okay.

119
00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:13.571
We're all here now. You can go.

120
00:09:39.557 --> 00:09:40.682
Bonita.

121
00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:53.212
Eso.

122
00:11:06.018 --> 00:11:07.977
You felt a sudden urge for Cuban music?

123
00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:09.812
The van left without me.

124
00:11:10.356 --> 00:11:11.731
I've been walking for an hour.

125
00:11:12.191 --> 00:11:14.734
- I can walk you back.
- No. You don't have to do that.


126
00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:16.527
Yeah, you're right.

127
00:11:16.862 --> 00:11:18.446
You'll find your way sooner or later.

128
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:20.823
Maybe in a week or a month.

129
00:11:22.117 --> 00:11:23.242
Let me just say goodbye.

130
00:11:23.702 --> 00:11:24.827
Abuelito!

131
00:11:31.835 --> 00:11:33.002
Bueno.

132
00:11:36.298 --> 00:11:37.340
What was it you called him?

133
00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:39.884
Abuelito. It's my grandpa.

134
00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:44.305
I'm Katey. What's your name?

135
00:11:44.765 --> 00:11:45.765
Javier.

136
00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:50.019
So what, you know, like,
five words in Spanish?


137
00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:51.521
Maybe 10.

138
00:11:53.023 --> 00:11:54.607
And what are you
studying so hard to do?

139
00:11:54.858 --> 00:11:56.859
I haven't figured it out yet.

140
00:11:56.986 --> 00:11:58.903
Here. Let me take that.

141
00:12:04.243 --> 00:12:06.285
I've never seen dancing like that.

142
00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:09.080
Like what?

143
00:12:09.957 --> 00:12:11.082
I don't know.

144
00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:13.251
I like it.

145
00:12:13.669 --> 00:12:14.794
It's very...

146
00:12:18.757 --> 00:12:19.757
Very Cuban?

147
00:12:19.883 --> 00:12:20.925
Yeah.

148
00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:50.580
We should get off the street.

149
00:12:51.123 --> 00:12:53.499
- Why?
- You don't understand what they're singing.


150
00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:02.759
No!

151
00:13:03.427 --> 00:13:04.677
That way!

152
00:13:07.306 --> 00:13:09.807
So you've got... Okay. Here she is.

153
00:13:09.892 --> 00:13:11.017
Thank you so much.

154
00:13:11.977 --> 00:13:13.978
Thank God. Katey, where have you been?

155
00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:17.065
I missed the bus.

156
00:13:17.858 --> 00:13:19.317
I'm fine. I walked.

157
00:13:19.485 --> 00:13:22.236
For heaven's sakes.
Katey, why didn't you call me?


158
00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:25.198
For all I knew, you could have
been kidnapped by rebels.


159
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.201
It's not the rebels
you should be worried about.


160
00:13:28.368 --> 00:13:29.494
What did you say?

161
00:13:33.749 --> 00:13:34.999
You're right.

162
00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:37.335
I'm sorry. I should have called.

163
00:13:37.377 --> 00:13:38.711
Honey, where's your book bag?

164
00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:43.800
I left it at school.

165
00:13:44.676 --> 00:13:45.676
It was heavy.

166
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.020
Oh, God.

167
00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:40.898
It was good I had all these
boring American books with me.


168
00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:43.401
They realized I couldn't be a revolutionary.

169
00:14:44.319 --> 00:14:45.611
I don't understand.

170
00:14:46.488 --> 00:14:47.738
They were just singing.

171
00:14:47.948 --> 00:14:50.616
There's not such a thing as
just singing here anymore.


172
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:56.664
You know, you're a pretty good dancer.

173
00:14:58.458 --> 00:14:59.625
I was terrible.

174
00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:03.212
Yeah. Yeah, you were terrible,

175
00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:05.715
but for an American, you move well.

176
00:15:06.008 --> 00:15:07.008
Thanks.

177
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:14.265
Why do you look in the mirror?

178
00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:17.101
I was trying to
remember the steps I saw.

179
00:15:17.603 --> 00:15:19.437
But what does looking
have to do with it?

180
00:15:20.647 --> 00:15:22.648
Just... Just feel the music.

181
00:15:23.942 --> 00:15:25.193
You should see for yourself.

182
00:15:26.278 --> 00:15:29.655
The real dancers are
at La Rosa Negra on Saturday night.


183
00:15:31.783 --> 00:15:33.284
I can't.

184
00:15:34.369 --> 00:15:37.872
I got invited to this country club thing.

185
00:15:38.207 --> 00:15:40.666
- Hey, that was fast.
- Yeah.


186
00:15:41.043 --> 00:15:42.793
Is that why you want to learn
Cuban dancing?


187
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:44.795
Just to impress your date?

188
00:15:45.797 --> 00:15:47.590
- No. I wanted to...
- Don't worry. Don't worry.


189
00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:49.300
They won't dance like that at the club.

190
00:15:49.718 --> 00:15:51.302
Just learn the foxtrot instead.

191
00:15:54.014 --> 00:15:55.556
I already know the foxtrot.

192
00:16:10.489 --> 00:16:12.073
Do we need to go shopping?

193
00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:15.409
I just thought you might be going
to the country club Saturday night.


194
00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:17.954
You just thought?

195
00:16:17.996 --> 00:16:19.872
Mrs. Phelps took me to lunch.

196
00:16:20.249 --> 00:16:22.667
You two aren't planning
an arranged marriage, are you?


197
00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:24.043
No. I should have thought of that.

198
00:16:25.837 --> 00:16:27.171
He's so cute.

199
00:16:29.132 --> 00:16:38.140
Do you, do you, do you
do you wanna dance?


200
00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:40.893
- Yolanda?
- Yes?


201
00:16:42.604 --> 00:16:43.813
Is this square?

202
00:16:45.148 --> 00:16:46.357
Square?

203
00:16:46.525 --> 00:16:47.650
Yeah, you know,

204
00:16:47.943 --> 00:16:49.026
like a square?

205
00:16:50.487 --> 00:16:52.280
Is a square good or bad?

206
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.490
It's bad.

207
00:16:55.534 --> 00:16:56.534
SÃ­.

208
00:16:56.868 --> 00:16:57.952
Is a square.

209
00:16:58.704 --> 00:16:59.745
Oh, God.

210
00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:02.915
I don't know.

211
00:17:03.458 --> 00:17:06.377
You're smaller than me. 
Your dresses'll be...

212
00:17:07.462 --> 00:17:08.587
Perfect.

213
00:17:10.757 --> 00:17:11.757
You're joking.

214
00:17:12.551 --> 00:17:14.427
Why? Is it square?

215
00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:17.847
Definitely not.

216
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.890
It's not fair!

217
00:17:21.226 --> 00:17:22.685
All of my friends are going.

218
00:17:22.853 --> 00:17:24.353
So why would you go, and I can't?

219
00:17:25.397 --> 00:17:26.647
I am older than you.

220
00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:29.358
Such a waste.

221
00:17:29.443 --> 00:17:30.943
You don't even know how to have fun.

222
00:17:48.295 --> 00:17:49.628
Sure you don't want me to stay?

223
00:17:51.256 --> 00:17:52.590
Dad, don't.

224
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.885
Okay. Bye.

225
00:18:00.724 --> 00:18:02.099
Be careful.

226
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:26.290
Polly.

227
00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:34.507
God, what'd she do? Paint it on?

228
00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:37.176
SeÃ±orita.

229
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:43.474
Wow!

230
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.185
I don't know.

231
00:18:46.269 --> 00:18:47.978
I do.

232
00:18:51.274 --> 00:18:54.360
I would like to invite you all
to the Club Palace on Christmas Eve...


233
00:18:54.444 --> 00:18:55.653
You been to the Palace yet?

234
00:18:55.695 --> 00:18:59.824
...to attend the annual
Latin ballroom amateur dance contest.


235
00:18:59.908 --> 00:19:01.075
I'll have to take you.

236
00:19:25.434 --> 00:19:26.767
You feel really good.

237
00:19:27.644 --> 00:19:29.353
Am I making you nervous?

238
00:19:30.105 --> 00:19:31.147
No.

239
00:19:31.648 --> 00:19:33.691
Well, you make me a little nervous,

240
00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:35.651
but don't tell anyone.

241
00:19:35.735 --> 00:19:37.695
It'll ruin my reputation.

242
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.704
Listen, we're going over to Polly's
for a little mojito party.


243
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.872
Yeah?

244
00:19:47.914 --> 00:19:49.498
Yeah, her parents are out of town again.

245
00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:50.875
What do you think?

246
00:19:51.084 --> 00:19:53.043
Steph can make a wicked mojito.

247
00:19:54.588 --> 00:19:55.588
Well...

248
00:19:55.714 --> 00:19:58.591
Hey, I'm sure we can get someone
to rustle you up a Shirley Temple.


249
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.886
Actually,

250
00:20:02.846 --> 00:20:05.431
James and I are gonna
go to a Cuban club.

251
00:20:05.557 --> 00:20:06.891
Where?

252
00:20:07.934 --> 00:20:09.143
La Rosa Negra.

253
00:20:11.146 --> 00:20:14.565
Yeah, we're going to the La Rosa Negra.

254
00:20:26.578 --> 00:20:27.745
Jesus.

255
00:20:51.937 --> 00:20:53.938
Look at the way they feel the music.

256
00:20:57.567 --> 00:20:58.984
They're feeling it, all right.

257
00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:05.157
I'll get us some drinks.

258
00:21:36.523 --> 00:21:37.565
Hi.

259
00:21:39.317 --> 00:21:40.401
You look so Cuban.

260
00:21:40.527 --> 00:21:41.569
So do you.

261
00:21:43.989 --> 00:21:45.656
Hi. I'm Javier.

262
00:21:47.576 --> 00:21:48.742
James Phelps.

263
00:21:48.827 --> 00:21:50.286
Yeah. I know you.

264
00:21:51.121 --> 00:21:53.163
So, the country club
wasn't all you expected?


265
00:21:54.374 --> 00:21:56.667
We thought we'd expand
our horizons a little bit.


266
00:21:57.085 --> 00:21:59.628
You mean actually experience Havana?

267
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.509
Do you mind if
I dance with your date?

268
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.347
Well, you'll have to ask her.

269
00:22:13.018 --> 00:22:14.059
Okay.

270
00:22:17.397 --> 00:22:21.942
Te quiero, Havana
The rhythm pumpin' in my heart


271
00:22:22.027 --> 00:22:23.861
In La Rosa

272
00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:27.239
We dance to the tempo of love

273
00:22:27.532 --> 00:22:29.199
Shall we give your boyfriend a show?

274
00:22:30.535 --> 00:22:31.910
He's not my boyfriend.

275
00:22:32.162 --> 00:22:36.582
Let your body talk
Till the voice in you says


276
00:22:36.666 --> 00:22:38.125
Say, baby

277
00:22:38.209 --> 00:22:41.795
I'm the one you
find deep in the groove

278
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.718
That drives your body and your senses

279
00:22:47.886 --> 00:22:52.806
I'm the heat inside
When rhythm and love collide


280
00:22:52.891 --> 00:22:53.891
Cuba

281
00:22:53.933 --> 00:22:57.853

Lose your date?

293
00:23:24.297 --> 00:23:26.674
Must be that Yankee
dancing with my brother.


294
00:23:29.636 --> 00:23:31.428
Good of you to bring
your girlfriend to Havana


295
00:23:31.513 --> 00:23:32.763
while you still have the chance.

296
00:23:34.099 --> 00:23:35.182
Why?

297
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.018
Are you gonna run us gringos out?

298
00:23:38.687 --> 00:23:41.355
That's right, comebola, so keep smiling.

Hey
Tu mÃºsica


312
00:24:23.565 --> 00:24:24.732
Raoul y Esmerelda,

313
00:24:24.983 --> 00:24:26.900
king and queen of La Rosa Negra.

314
00:24:33.241 --> 00:24:34.908
When they dance, the floor is theirs.

315
00:24:58.308 --> 00:25:00.225
You're as good a dancer as he is.

316
00:25:06.733 --> 00:25:09.318
Katey, this is my brother Carlos.

317
00:25:10.361 --> 00:25:11.987
- Arturo and Miguel.
- Hola.


318
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.071
Hola.

319
00:25:14.365 --> 00:25:16.200
We were just talking politics.

320
00:25:16.367 --> 00:25:19.036
Really? Well, my brother loves talking.

321
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.038
Javier doesn't like to talk politics.

322
00:25:21.331 --> 00:25:24.416
After all, the revolution
would screw up his job kissing your asses.


323
00:25:24.542 --> 00:25:25.918
And where's the revolution tonight?

324
00:25:26.002 --> 00:25:27.252
On the dance floor?

325
00:25:29.088 --> 00:25:32.883
While you boys kiss and make up,
we're gonna get some fresh air.


326
00:25:33.343 --> 00:25:34.593
Let's go.

327
00:25:44.938 --> 00:25:46.480
I was enjoying the dancing.

328
00:25:46.648 --> 00:25:48.065
You...

329
00:25:48.107 --> 00:25:49.483
You were very hot.

330
00:25:56.491 --> 00:25:58.826
It's not the safest part of town.

331
00:26:01.204 --> 00:26:02.538
No, don't.

332
00:26:04.749 --> 00:26:06.124
Take me home, will you...

333
00:26:07.418 --> 00:26:08.418
Stop it!

334
00:26:08.503 --> 00:26:09.628
Get off!

335
00:26:11.005 --> 00:26:12.464
You didn't say no to him.

336
00:26:19.472 --> 00:26:20.514
Katey!

337
00:26:20.765 --> 00:26:23.225
Katey, get back in the damn car!
I'll take you home.


338
00:26:29.732 --> 00:26:32.442
Hey.

339
00:26:34.696 --> 00:26:35.779
Where is he?

340
00:26:35.822 --> 00:26:38.740
He's gone. He's gone.
It's okay. It's okay, I'm fine.


341
00:26:41.995 --> 00:26:43.996
My dad works for his dad.

342
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:46.999
I just want to forget about it.

343
00:26:49.294 --> 00:26:50.460
Don't worry.

344
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.004
I'll take you home.

345
00:26:53.298 --> 00:26:54.798
Come on.

346
00:26:57.135 --> 00:26:58.635
I should have seen it coming.

347
00:26:59.387 --> 00:27:01.597
I guess I'm not used to...

348
00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:02.681
Bastards?

349
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:04.099
Guys.

350
00:27:04.142 --> 00:27:06.977
What? You never had
a boyfriend in America?


351
00:27:08.062 --> 00:27:11.982
No. I liked this one guy,
but it didn't work out.


352
00:27:12.025 --> 00:27:13.025
Why not?

353
00:27:13.151 --> 00:27:14.651
He didn't know I existed.

354
00:27:14.694 --> 00:27:17.237
Yeah. That could be a problem.

355
00:27:21.326 --> 00:27:22.826
This is as far as I go.

356
00:27:24.203 --> 00:27:26.830
The staff is not supposed to
mix with guests.


357
00:27:27.582 --> 00:27:29.458
It took me a long
time to find this job.

358
00:27:29.542 --> 00:27:31.710
You'd be in trouble
for walking me up there?

359
00:27:31.878 --> 00:27:33.045
Yeah.

360
00:27:33.963 --> 00:27:35.130
It's ridiculous.

361
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.101
AdiÃ³s.

362
00:27:51.522 --> 00:27:53.023
Thanks for walking me home.

363
00:27:54.692 --> 00:27:56.693
I'm sorry your evening was

364
00:27:57.528 --> 00:27:58.528
so difficult.

365
00:28:00.365 --> 00:28:01.657
Not all of it was.

366
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.151
My job is to make you look beautiful.

367
00:28:38.236 --> 00:28:41.405
Your job is to make
our bodies like one. Watch.


368
00:29:28.578 --> 00:29:29.703
Thanks.

369
00:29:29.912 --> 00:29:31.830
Okay, that's it for today.

370
00:29:32.582 --> 00:29:35.876
Who's gonna enter
the big dance contest?


371
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.210
Isn't it just for locals?

372
00:29:37.378 --> 00:29:39.546
Actually, it's for anyone
who has the guts to try.


373
00:29:40.131 --> 00:29:41.131
What about you?

374
00:29:42.383 --> 00:29:43.425
Me?

375
00:29:44.802 --> 00:29:46.303
No, I can't. I'm not good enough.

376
00:29:47.638 --> 00:29:49.473
Sure you are. I've seen you practicing.

377
00:29:55.188 --> 00:29:56.313
Easy.

378
00:30:06.699 --> 00:30:07.908
Think about it.

379
00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:16.166
Katey!

380
00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:18.794
You left your sweater in my car. I...

381
00:30:18.836 --> 00:30:20.670
- Just bring it to school.
- Hey, wait a second.


382
00:30:21.339 --> 00:30:22.422
Katey.

383
00:30:24.675 --> 00:30:25.717
I'm really sorry.

384
00:30:26.344 --> 00:30:28.970
I was drinking. 
I would never hurt you.

385
00:30:31.265 --> 00:30:32.474
He's not here.

386
00:30:35.144 --> 00:30:36.186
They fired him.

387
00:30:36.646 --> 00:30:37.771
What?

388
00:30:38.356 --> 00:30:41.358
Lois and your sister, they saw you.

389
00:30:44.612 --> 00:30:45.695
I'm sorry.

390
00:30:46.823 --> 00:30:47.823
I gotta go.

391
00:30:58.876 --> 00:31:00.877
You know,
you need to keep your mouth shut.


392
00:31:00.962 --> 00:31:02.546
The things you do have consequences.

393
00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:04.214
Lois is the one who blabbed it.

394
00:31:04.257 --> 00:31:05.674
Right.

395
00:31:06.092 --> 00:31:07.801
And you had nothing to do with it.

396
00:31:08.469 --> 00:31:10.512
Well, what were you doing
with that guy, anyway?


397
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:11.805
It's embarrassing.

398
00:31:12.348 --> 00:31:14.391
Is that you talking, or
is it those other girls?

399
00:31:14.892 --> 00:31:16.226
He's not like us.

400
00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:18.478
There is no us, Susie.

401
00:31:33.244 --> 00:31:35.036
- Hola.
- Hola.


402
00:31:40.793 --> 00:31:41.793
SÃ­.

403
00:31:43.713 --> 00:31:44.754
Yes?

404
00:31:44.881 --> 00:31:46.381
I'm a friend of Javier's.

405
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:47.841
CÃ³mo?

406
00:31:48.593 --> 00:31:49.593
From the hotel.

407
00:31:51.596 --> 00:31:54.639
I didn't know he
had friends in the hotel.

408
00:31:56.475 --> 00:31:57.517
Is he here?

409
00:31:58.519 --> 00:32:01.104
No. He's working there now.

410
00:32:01.814 --> 00:32:03.190
You don't see him?

411
00:32:15.828 --> 00:32:16.828
So...

412
00:32:17.788 --> 00:32:19.164
What do you want with my brother?

413
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:20.957
I need to talk to him.

414
00:32:22.293 --> 00:32:24.461
You got him fired. 
Isn't that enough?

415
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.758
I know a way
he can make some money.

416
00:32:31.135 --> 00:32:34.596
You Yankees, you come here,
and you pour money into the casinos,


417
00:32:34.639 --> 00:32:37.140
into the pockets
of the gangsters who run this country,


418
00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:40.936
the same gangsters
who murder innocent people, like my father.


419
00:32:41.687 --> 00:32:42.812
I didn't know.

420
00:32:43.689 --> 00:32:45.523
That's right. You don't know.

421
00:32:55.952 --> 00:32:57.202
Javi.

422
00:33:03.709 --> 00:33:05.710
I feel terrible about what happened.

423
00:33:05.795 --> 00:33:07.587
- I went to your house...
- My house?


424
00:33:07.672 --> 00:33:09.089
You told my mother I was fired?

425
00:33:09.173 --> 00:33:10.840
- No, I didn't.
- So what do you want?


426
00:33:10.925 --> 00:33:12.175
I told her I
wanted to talk to you.

427
00:33:13.511 --> 00:33:14.719
I'm sorry you got fired.

428
00:33:16.639 --> 00:33:18.848
Don't worry. It's my fault. 
I knew better.

429
00:33:20.851 --> 00:33:22.102
Is this your new job?

430
00:33:22.561 --> 00:33:24.980
That's right. You make them. 
We steal them.

431
00:33:25.523 --> 00:33:26.982
Isn't that right, Javi?

432
00:33:32.738 --> 00:33:34.197
There's this...

433
00:33:35.116 --> 00:33:38.702
This dance contest
at the Palace, Christmas Eve.


434
00:33:40.204 --> 00:33:41.288
I think you should go.

435
00:33:42.206 --> 00:33:43.623
And see if they need any busboys?

436
00:33:44.834 --> 00:33:45.875
That's not what I mean.

437
00:33:45.918 --> 00:33:47.711
You know what kind of people
goes to the Palace?


438
00:33:49.547 --> 00:33:50.755
I could get you in.

439
00:33:51.757 --> 00:33:53.383
You'd have to be my partner.

440
00:33:58.097 --> 00:33:59.431
You mean dance with you?

441
00:34:00.516 --> 00:34:01.766
God, I'm not that bad.

442
00:34:05.104 --> 00:34:06.855
You didn't seem to mind it last night.

443
00:34:06.897 --> 00:34:08.440
I wasn't trying to win a contest.

444
00:34:08.649 --> 00:34:09.691
Weren't you?

445
00:34:14.196 --> 00:34:16.448
I'm sorry, but I have
a lot of work to do.

446
00:34:17.533 --> 00:34:20.076
The prize for the semifinals is $300.

447
00:34:22.288 --> 00:34:24.247
The grand prize is $5,000.

448
00:34:24.832 --> 00:34:26.583
The winners get to go to America.

449
00:34:28.794 --> 00:34:29.919
I don't have time.

450
00:35:37.446 --> 00:35:38.488
Hi.

451
00:35:44.745 --> 00:35:46.079
This contest,

452
00:35:47.498 --> 00:35:48.832
does it cost money?

453
00:35:50.084 --> 00:35:51.084
No.

454
00:35:52.753 --> 00:35:55.755
You know that it's ballroom dancing.
It's not what I do.


455
00:35:55.965 --> 00:35:57.507
It's Latin ballroom.

456
00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:00.677
If we mix what you do with what I do,
I really think we'd have something.


457
00:36:01.637 --> 00:36:03.513
I still have to teach you everything.

458
00:36:04.014 --> 00:36:05.181
Not everything.

459
00:36:06.517 --> 00:36:08.518
I'll have to teach
you a few things, too.

460
00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:15.400
Can we do this?

461
00:36:24.034 --> 00:36:26.161
- What?
- What are you doing?


462
00:36:26.328 --> 00:36:27.537
Just dancing.

463
00:36:28.372 --> 00:36:29.914
But this is a routine.

464
00:36:30.374 --> 00:36:33.877
You can't just do what you feel like
when you feel like it.


465
00:36:33.919 --> 00:36:35.211
When I dance, I have no routine.

466
00:36:35.296 --> 00:36:37.672
But this is a contest. 
We need a structure.

467
00:36:37.715 --> 00:36:39.048
Can I see that?

468
00:36:44.346 --> 00:36:48.391
First you learn to move,
and then we worry about lists and words.


469
00:36:48.476 --> 00:36:49.559
Okay. Fine.

470
00:36:51.228 --> 00:36:52.353
How do you call this?

471
00:36:53.189 --> 00:36:54.230
Your hips?

472
00:36:55.065 --> 00:36:56.232
Move your hips.

473
00:36:56.358 --> 00:36:57.901
And circle.

474
00:36:59.778 --> 00:37:01.070
Come on.

475
00:37:01.113 --> 00:37:02.363
Come on. And circle.

476
00:37:03.866 --> 00:37:04.908
That's a box.

477
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.661
What, are you crazy?
Why should I cover for you?


478
00:37:08.746 --> 00:37:10.872
You want me to tell them what happened?

479
00:37:11.749 --> 00:37:12.916
Well, hello there.

480
00:37:13.792 --> 00:37:14.792
Mom!

481
00:37:14.877 --> 00:37:15.919
We're just heading over for some lemonade.

482
00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:17.086
Would you care to join us?

483
00:37:17.171 --> 00:37:18.379
No, no.

484
00:37:19.173 --> 00:37:20.590
We'll take a rain check.

485
00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:22.509
Okay. You two have fun.

486
00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.512
I'm gonna help Javier,
and you're gonna help me.


487
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.352
Your frame is really weak.

488
00:37:36.106 --> 00:37:37.232
Better?

489
00:37:37.399 --> 00:37:39.526
I could do without the bruises, thanks.

490
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.863
I can fit another couple between us.

491
00:37:43.948 --> 00:37:45.532
It's not gonna be a crowded club.

492
00:37:47.243 --> 00:37:49.160
We've gotta sweep across the dance floor.

493
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.620
Okay.

494
00:37:50.704 --> 00:37:52.163
Okay, I can sweep.

495
00:37:54.416 --> 00:37:56.501
What are you doing? 
Your steps are too big.

496
00:37:56.585 --> 00:37:57.835
No, I'm sweeping.

497
00:37:58.754 --> 00:38:00.255
How's it going with James?

498
00:38:00.339 --> 00:38:01.631
I got homework to do.

499
00:38:01.715 --> 00:38:02.757
You know what, sweetie?

500
00:38:05.719 --> 00:38:09.222
I've been wanting to ask you
if you have any questions


501
00:38:09.974 --> 00:38:12.433
or concerns, you know,
about you and James.


502
00:38:15.479 --> 00:38:18.731
It's like dancing with
my mother's ironing board.


503
00:38:21.944 --> 00:38:23.152
Just close your eyes.

504
00:38:23.904 --> 00:38:25.363
- Why?
- Just do it.


505
00:38:35.833 --> 00:38:37.667
It's awkward to talk about, but...

506
00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:41.170
It's important that you not
let a boy pressure you.


507
00:38:42.006 --> 00:38:45.174
And even if you have certain feelings
when you're with James,


508
00:38:45.259 --> 00:38:48.761
feelings that you aren't used to having...

509
00:38:57.896 --> 00:39:00.148
Oh, God! Do you have
to be such a guy?

510
00:39:03.068 --> 00:39:04.110
Okay.

511
00:39:05.404 --> 00:39:06.863
Okay, I'll be the girl.

512
00:39:12.578 --> 00:39:14.704
The decisions you make now,

513
00:39:14.788 --> 00:39:17.582
the choices you make,
could affect your whole life.


514
00:39:19.376 --> 00:39:20.710
Do you understand what I'm saying?

515
00:39:22.046 --> 00:39:23.046
You do?

516
00:40:10.803 --> 00:40:12.595
I didn't want to waste the music.

517
00:40:14.765 --> 00:40:16.432
Of course not.

518
00:40:17.726 --> 00:40:19.143
What's the problem?

519
00:40:20.104 --> 00:40:22.021
Why are you so afraid
to let me lead you?

520
00:40:24.441 --> 00:40:25.525
I'm not.

521
00:40:26.777 --> 00:40:27.777
You are.

522
00:40:28.612 --> 00:40:30.196
When you're ready to say you're afraid,

523
00:40:31.156 --> 00:40:32.240
let me know.

524
00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:42.458
- Hey.
- Sorry.


525
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.918
No, no, no. Stay.

526
00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:45.628
I'm almost done anyway.

527
00:40:47.464 --> 00:40:48.840
So, what did you decide?

528
00:40:50.634 --> 00:40:51.926
I entered the contest.

529
00:40:52.761 --> 00:40:53.970
All right.

530
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:55.972
Good for you. So how's it going?

531
00:40:57.182 --> 00:40:59.600
Great. It's going great.

532
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:04.230
Really?

533
00:41:05.065 --> 00:41:06.482
No, it's not.

534
00:41:08.986 --> 00:41:11.070
God, I must have been crazy
to think we could do this.


535
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.989
It's in two weeks,

536
00:41:14.408 --> 00:41:17.577
and whenever he pushes, I pull,

537
00:41:18.162 --> 00:41:22.915
and I'm flowing, and I'm being free,
and I'm making a circle,


538
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.169
and I'm not an ironing board anymore,
and it's still not working.


539
00:41:28.005 --> 00:41:30.006
And now he says, "You're afraid."

540
00:41:31.341 --> 00:41:32.592
Are you?

541
00:41:33.343 --> 00:41:34.385
No.

542
00:41:36.388 --> 00:41:37.513
That's too bad.

543
00:41:42.019 --> 00:41:43.394
Come here.

544
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.146
Un momento. Stand right here.

545
00:41:47.524 --> 00:41:48.649
Let me see your frame.

546
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.360
Good.

547
00:41:55.115 --> 00:41:56.115
A little pressure.

548
00:42:02.539 --> 00:42:04.040
So where'd you learn this?

549
00:42:04.792 --> 00:42:06.584
My parents. They were dancers.

550
00:42:07.377 --> 00:42:08.461
Really?

551
00:42:11.173 --> 00:42:12.173
Relax.

552
00:42:13.008 --> 00:42:14.050
Yes.

553
00:42:14.635 --> 00:42:15.760
Drop your arms.

554
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.220
Breathe.

555
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:21.599
Now just basic.

556
00:42:24.728 --> 00:42:25.853
Good.

557
00:42:28.398 --> 00:42:30.525
What did you mean when you said,
"That's too bad"?


558
00:42:32.611 --> 00:42:34.821
If you can't move through your fear
and connect with yourself,


559
00:42:35.405 --> 00:42:37.615
there's absolutely no way
you're gonna connect with your partner.


560
00:42:39.785 --> 00:42:40.785
Listen to me.

561
00:42:41.537 --> 00:42:46.082
I know that it's scary as hell
to let another person touch that part of you.


562
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.750
But if you do,

563
00:42:48.919 --> 00:42:50.127
it's worth it.

564
00:42:51.421 --> 00:42:53.256
Now forget everything I just said and dance.

565
00:44:03.076 --> 00:44:04.827
The floor is yours.

566
00:44:06.413 --> 00:44:07.872
I'll see you.

567
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:20.718
Okay, I am.

568
00:44:23.597 --> 00:44:25.014
You're what?

569
00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:27.850
Afraid.

570
00:44:29.937 --> 00:44:33.105
So, the movement has to be fluid,
like the water.


571
00:44:35.025 --> 00:44:36.025
Afro
-Cuban dance,

572
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:37.860
it's the dance of slaves.

573
00:44:38.695 --> 00:44:41.656
When they danced,
it was their only time to feel free.


574
00:44:42.199 --> 00:44:46.077
So, they could be a bird, you know,

575
00:44:47.287 --> 00:44:50.539
or do a flamenco step
and make fun of their owners.


576
00:44:51.875 --> 00:44:53.209
Or just be in the sea

577
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:55.628
instead of being stuck on an island
away from home.


578
00:44:57.714 --> 00:44:59.215
It's a dance about being

579
00:44:59.299 --> 00:45:01.425
exactly who you want
to be in that moment.

580
00:45:06.974 --> 00:45:10.184
It has to feel and look

581
00:45:12.062 --> 00:45:13.980
as natural as the waves.

582
00:45:15.065 --> 00:45:16.315
Coming.

583
00:45:17.985 --> 00:45:19.318
Going.

584
00:45:20.654 --> 00:45:22.113
Coming.

585
00:45:26.785 --> 00:45:30.079
We were having dinner,
and there was a knock on the door.


586
00:45:30.247 --> 00:45:33.082
Suddenly, two policemen
were taking my father away.


587
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.042
The traitor could have been anyone.

588
00:45:35.919 --> 00:45:38.254
Batista has his spies everywhere.

589
00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:40.881
That's the thing, you know?

590
00:45:40.924 --> 00:45:42.258
My father never hurt anybody.

591
00:45:42.759 --> 00:45:44.802
He was just a free thinker,

592
00:45:45.345 --> 00:45:46.929
but someone didn't like his thoughts.

593
00:45:49.933 --> 00:45:52.935
We had a funeral,
but we never found his body.


594
00:45:53.895 --> 00:45:56.689
Carlos disappeared for a while,
afraid he would be next,


595
00:45:56.773 --> 00:45:58.691
and then, this girl
shows up with a baby,

596
00:45:58.775 --> 00:46:00.985
says it's his and she cannot afford it,

597
00:46:02.112 --> 00:46:04.113
and suddenly I'm in charge
of my whole family.


598
00:46:05.323 --> 00:46:07.116
Maybe it's not what you want for yourself,

599
00:46:07.159 --> 00:46:08.784
but you are making a difference.

600
00:46:08.827 --> 00:46:11.245
There's a revolution out there,
and what am I doing?


601
00:46:12.539 --> 00:46:14.790
Just painting stolen cars and babysitting.

602
00:46:14.916 --> 00:46:16.375
No, you're keeping your family alive.

603
00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.045
That's the most important thing
you could do.


604
00:46:22.966 --> 00:46:24.842
If we could really win this contest,

605
00:46:27.804 --> 00:46:30.931
maybe I can bring my family
to America with us.


606
00:46:39.149 --> 00:46:41.484
Your parents, they're perfect.

607
00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.155
You see how much they want to be
in each other's arms?


608
00:46:48.658 --> 00:46:50.284
For us to dance together,

609
00:46:50.577 --> 00:46:52.328
I mean, really dance,

610
00:46:52.412 --> 00:46:54.163
that's how it has to be.

611
00:48:20.292 --> 00:48:22.168
Don't let us interrupt you.

612
00:48:22.252 --> 00:48:23.836
No. No, we were just...

613
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.338
Yeah, we saw.
Listen, we have more stuff in the alley


614
00:48:26.423 --> 00:48:28.591
if you want to do something useful, Javier.

615
00:48:30.927 --> 00:48:32.595
I should get home.

616
00:48:49.654 --> 00:48:51.572
Thanks for stopping by.

617
00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:54.617
It's half an hour before curfew.

618
00:48:55.952 --> 00:48:57.661
What'd you do, join the circus?

619
00:49:00.665 --> 00:49:02.958
You gonna tell me
you were out with James?


620
00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.793
That's what you told your mother.

621
00:49:06.129 --> 00:49:08.464
I never told her what Susie said.

622
00:49:09.633 --> 00:49:11.217
Susie was wrong.

623
00:49:13.637 --> 00:49:14.637
Okay.

624
00:49:15.722 --> 00:49:16.847
Good night, Dad.

625
00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:22.144
Hi.

626
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:28.734
How long are you
gonna be mad at me?

627
00:49:35.033 --> 00:49:36.200
The girls here...

628
00:49:36.284 --> 00:49:38.160
I told Lois that I liked Jane Eyre,

629
00:49:38.203 --> 00:49:39.954
and she asked me
what movie she was in.

630
00:49:44.084 --> 00:49:46.085
I'm really sorry that I told on you.

631
00:49:48.129 --> 00:49:49.797
And what I said about Javier.

632
00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.715
I was wrong.

633
00:49:57.597 --> 00:49:59.348
You gotta think for yourself, Suze.

634
00:50:00.183 --> 00:50:01.392
I know.

635
00:50:01.935 --> 00:50:02.977
I miss you.

636
00:50:11.361 --> 00:50:13.362
Well, I've been dying to tell you.

637
00:50:13.405 --> 00:50:15.281
Can you keep a secret this time?

638
00:53:06.035 --> 00:53:07.035
No.

639
00:53:10.081 --> 00:53:11.373
SÃ­, claro.

640
00:53:22.677 --> 00:53:26.096
Susie, your mother and I have
some very disappointing news.


641
00:53:27.223 --> 00:53:29.266
Now, I know how you love to decorate
the Christmas tree


642
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:31.226
and sing carols and watch home movies,

643
00:53:31.311 --> 00:53:33.187
but I'm afraid tonight,

644
00:53:33.897 --> 00:53:35.481
we're all gonna have
to go to the Palace.

645
00:53:36.733 --> 00:53:37.900
All of us?

646
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:39.735
Yes, Susie, all of us.

647
00:53:39.861 --> 00:53:41.320
I know it's your big night with James,

648
00:53:41.404 --> 00:53:44.239
but you think you could
save your old man one dance?


649
00:53:44.574 --> 00:53:46.200
When did this happen?

650
00:53:46.326 --> 00:53:47.451
Well, you know your father.

651
00:53:47.869 --> 00:53:49.578
Blabs to everyone we were dancers.

652
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:52.247
So the Phelpses invited us
to the Latin ballroom contest.


653
00:53:52.332 --> 00:53:53.999
Where, I hear, the dancing is
supposed to be pretty good.


654
00:53:54.292 --> 00:53:57.211
But your mother and I'll be
looking out for mistakes.


655
00:54:06.554 --> 00:54:09.598
I can't wait to see
the looks on your parents' faces.


656
00:54:09.682 --> 00:54:10.933
Don't remind me.

657
00:54:11.226 --> 00:54:12.643
I really should be scolding you

658
00:54:12.727 --> 00:54:14.353
for keeping her out till all hours.

659
00:54:14.437 --> 00:54:16.897
Don't worry, ma'am.
We've done nothing you'd disapprove of.


660
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:18.774
I can promise you that.

661
00:54:31.746 --> 00:54:32.746
Thank you.

662
00:54:32.914 --> 00:54:33.997
Here.

663
00:54:34.123 --> 00:54:35.541
You two make a very cute couple.

664
00:54:36.459 --> 00:54:38.085
So many of the girls coming over

665
00:54:38.127 --> 00:54:39.503
from the States these days

666
00:54:39.587 --> 00:54:41.713
get a little, you know, wild.

667
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:44.508
You're lucky to have such lovely daughters.

668
00:54:45.385 --> 00:54:47.553
Ladies and gentlemen, merry Christmas!

669
00:54:47.679 --> 00:54:48.929
Injust a few moments,

670
00:54:48.972 --> 00:54:51.473
we'll begin this evening's special event.

671
00:54:51.516 --> 00:54:54.351
So, when do we get to see
the championship dancers?


672
00:54:54.477 --> 00:54:56.144
We're hardly champions.

673
00:54:56.312 --> 00:54:58.647
You're just being modest.

674
00:54:58.856 --> 00:55:01.441
Come on. I've never seen you guys
dance in public before.


675
00:55:03.361 --> 00:55:05.904
Actually, I thought if your husband
didn't mind, you and I might...


676
00:55:08.032 --> 00:55:09.283
James.

677
00:55:09.534 --> 00:55:11.827
Maybe Katey would like to dance.

678
00:55:13.162 --> 00:55:15.080
Would you like to dance?

679
00:55:16.416 --> 00:55:18.417
I have to find a ladies' room.

680
00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:19.751
I'll escort you.

681
00:55:19.919 --> 00:55:21.128
No, no, I'm fine.

682
00:55:32.015 --> 00:55:33.515
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I was...


683
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.058
This is a crazy idea.

684
00:55:35.351 --> 00:55:37.102
No. We're gonna win.

685
00:55:42.025 --> 00:55:44.359
This is the moment
you have all been waiting for,


686
00:55:44.402 --> 00:55:46.903
the Latin ballroom competition!

687
00:55:47.363 --> 00:55:49.197
Three talented couples will be chosen

688
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.700
to compete in the
finals on New Year's Eve.

689
00:55:51.743 --> 00:55:53.452
- QuÃ© bonita.
- Gracias.


690
00:55:53.828 --> 00:55:55.037
SeÃ±oritas y seÃ±ores,

691
00:55:55.079 --> 00:55:57.956
presenting the brightest star
of the Havana night,


692
00:55:58.041 --> 00:56:00.334
Lola Martinez!

693
00:56:07.925 --> 00:56:09.551
Where's Katey?

694
00:56:10.428 --> 00:56:11.762
Just wait.

695
00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.268
Oh, my God!

696
00:56:21.939 --> 00:56:24.483
Funny thing is
when I look into your eyes


697
00:56:24.651 --> 00:56:27.194
I sense something
so sincere in your disguise


698
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:30.030
You whisper secrets
I hear only in my dreams


699
00:56:30.239 --> 00:56:33.116
Then I wake up
to your tele-smoke screen


700
00:56:33.201 --> 00:56:35.994
I wait patiently
while you play your game


701
00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:37.454
'Cause in the end

702
00:56:37.538 --> 00:56:39.289
I'll be the winner all the same

703
00:56:39.374 --> 00:56:41.917
You'll see clearly
when the song comes to a stop


704
00:56:42.126 --> 00:56:44.670
I'll be the one
blowing kisses from the top


705
00:56:44.754 --> 00:56:47.047
So, baby, stop
You're surrounded


706
00:56:47.674 --> 00:56:49.925
I got my love all around ya

707
00:56:50.718 --> 00:56:53.011
- One wrong move...
- Move and I'll drown ya


708
00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:55.889
And that'll end ya
You should surrender


709
00:56:56.099 --> 00:56:58.475
You'll never win
unless you give in


710
00:56:58.559 --> 00:57:01.895
- So baby, stop
- Stop, you're surrounded


711
00:57:01.938 --> 00:57:04.564
- I got my love
- Love all around ya


712
00:57:05.108 --> 00:57:07.442
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya


713
00:57:07.527 --> 00:57:10.320
And that'll end ya
You should surrender


714
00:57:10.446 --> 00:57:12.614
You'll never win
unless you give in


715
00:57:12.699 --> 00:57:14.991
So won't you give
our love a chance?


716
00:57:15.201 --> 00:57:17.452
Or do you
only wanna dance?


717
00:57:19.622 --> 00:57:22.207
You put your lips
very closely to my face


718
00:57:22.291 --> 00:57:25.127
And then you run away
And so begins the chase


719
00:57:25.461 --> 00:57:27.921
I'll be the hunter
But, boy, you better pray


720
00:57:27.964 --> 00:57:31.174
'Cause when I want ya
I'll get you anyway


721
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.136
You know what I wanna do
It ain't anything new


722
00:57:34.679 --> 00:57:38.056
I'm tired of dropping clues
So when I step to you


723
00:57:38.141 --> 00:57:39.933
Will you rise
to my occasion?


724
00:57:39.976 --> 00:57:42.894
Or will you make me
change your station?


725
00:57:42.979 --> 00:57:45.522
Stop, you're surrounded

726
00:57:45.606 --> 00:57:47.691
- I got my love
- Love all around ya


727
00:57:47.775 --> 00:57:50.610
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya


728
00:57:50.653 --> 00:57:53.780
And that'll end ya
You should surrender


729
00:57:53.823 --> 00:57:56.074
You'll never win
unless you give in


730
00:57:56.159 --> 00:57:59.494
- So stop
- Stop, you're surrounded


731
00:57:59.662 --> 00:58:01.913
- I got my love
- Love all around ya


732
00:58:01.998 --> 00:58:04.833
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya


733
00:58:05.251 --> 00:58:08.170
And that'll end ya
You should surrender


734
00:58:08.212 --> 00:58:10.380
You'll never win
unless you give in


735
00:58:10.465 --> 00:58:12.841
So won't you give
our love a chance?


736
00:58:13.676 --> 00:58:15.469
If you take my hands

737
00:58:15.511 --> 00:58:18.180
And follow my lead
I'll make you dance


738
00:58:18.264 --> 00:58:19.681
I can make you dance

739
00:58:19.766 --> 00:58:22.017
But if you get my feet
and miss the beat


740
00:58:22.101 --> 00:58:24.144
Then I can't take
that chance


741
00:58:24.187 --> 00:58:25.437
I can't take that chance

742
00:58:25.646 --> 00:58:27.981
If you take my hands
and follow my lead


743
00:58:28.107 --> 00:58:30.942
- I'll make you dance
- I can make you dance


744
00:58:31.027 --> 00:58:33.195
But if you get my feet
and miss the beat


745
00:58:33.237 --> 00:58:35.489
Then I can't take
that chance


746
00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:36.531
I can't take it

747
00:58:36.657 --> 00:58:39.201
- Stop
- Stop, you're surrounded


748
00:58:39.702 --> 00:58:42.370
- I got my love
- Love all around ya


749
00:58:42.622 --> 00:58:45.123
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya


750
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:48.251
- So, stop
- Stop, you're surrounded


751
00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:51.171
- I got my love
- Love all around ya


752
00:58:51.214 --> 00:58:54.090
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya


753
00:58:54.467 --> 00:58:57.219
And that'll end ya
You should surrender


754
00:58:57.553 --> 00:58:59.679
You'll never win
unless you give in


755
00:59:00.056 --> 00:59:01.848
So won't you give
our love a chance?


756
00:59:24.455 --> 00:59:25.831
Ladies and gentlemen,

757
00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.583
the judges have chosen
our three finalist couples


758
00:59:28.626 --> 00:59:29.876
for next week.

759
00:59:29.919 --> 00:59:32.087
And they are

760
00:59:32.213 --> 00:59:37.759
couple number five,
Jose Velarde and Iris Mesa!


761
00:59:39.637 --> 00:59:41.763
Couple number nine,

762
00:59:42.557 --> 00:59:45.517
Tino and Lourdes Martel!

763
00:59:48.563 --> 00:59:49.729
And,

764
00:59:50.273 --> 00:59:51.940
couple number two,

765
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:56.945
Javier Suarez and Katey Miller!

766
01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:09.916
What could we have possibly done

767
01:00:09.959 --> 01:00:11.918
to make you want
to hurt us so much?

768
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:13.837
You humiliate us in front of everyone,

769
01:00:13.921 --> 01:00:15.589
including your father's boss.

770
01:00:15.631 --> 01:00:17.173
What, did you figure
that he'd lose his job...

771
01:00:17.258 --> 01:00:18.800
- No one's losing their job.
...and we'd have to go back?


772
01:00:18.885 --> 01:00:21.386
- You're going to lose your job?
- No. Please, go to bed.


773
01:00:21.804 --> 01:00:23.054
I didn't do anything.

774
01:00:23.139 --> 01:00:25.390
- You lied to us.
- I know, and I'm sorry,


775
01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.350
but I knew you wouldn't let me try...

776
01:00:27.435 --> 01:00:29.144
Kiss a Cuban pool
boy in front of everyone?

777
01:00:29.228 --> 01:00:30.937
You're damn straight we wouldn't.

778
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.522
And why in the world
would you wanna hurt James?


779
01:00:32.607 --> 01:00:34.274
I thought you liked him.

780
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:36.568
No, you liked him.

781
01:00:36.652 --> 01:00:39.821
Because he fits into your
perfect country club world.


782
01:00:39.989 --> 01:00:41.656
There's nothing wrong with that world.

783
01:00:41.866 --> 01:00:43.658
No, but he couldn't
keep his hands off me.

784
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:45.493
What? What happened?

785
01:00:45.995 --> 01:00:47.996
Nothing happened. I'm fine.

786
01:00:48.039 --> 01:00:49.039
Why didn't you tell us?

787
01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:51.917
Because I didn't want
to mess up your job.

788
01:00:52.835 --> 01:00:54.544
Katey,

789
01:00:54.629 --> 01:00:57.380
how could you think that my job
would be more important than you?


790
01:00:59.842 --> 01:01:01.885
I didn't want to hurt you.

791
01:01:03.596 --> 01:01:05.680
I just wanted to help Javier,

792
01:01:05.765 --> 01:01:07.265
which is his name, by the way.

793
01:01:10.061 --> 01:01:12.395
Oh, God, I love dancing with him.

794
01:01:13.856 --> 01:01:15.273
Oh, Katey.

795
01:01:18.945 --> 01:01:21.571
Did it ever occur to you that
that boy might be using you?


796
01:01:21.656 --> 01:01:24.491
A nice American girl
who can be his ticket out of here.


797
01:01:24.533 --> 01:01:26.034
- That's not true.
- You may love dancing with that boy,


798
01:01:26.118 --> 01:01:27.619
but there are more important factors here,

799
01:01:27.703 --> 01:01:28.787
like your family and your future!

800
01:01:28.871 --> 01:01:31.373
Why does it have to be either-or?
Just because you gave up your passion,


801
01:01:31.457 --> 01:01:32.916
why should I?

802
01:01:40.716 --> 01:01:46.930
Katey.

803
01:01:47.014 --> 01:01:48.390
Katey, wait.

804
01:01:48.474 --> 01:01:50.558
- Honey, wait!
- I'm going to Javier's.


805
01:01:50.726 --> 01:01:52.227
Your mother's just trying to protect you.

806
01:01:52.353 --> 01:01:53.853
I'm gonna be out
there on New Year's Eve,

807
01:01:53.938 --> 01:01:55.897
no matter what you and Mom think.

808
01:01:56.607 --> 01:01:58.066
No more lies.

809
01:02:03.906 --> 01:02:05.740
He's out celebrating,

810
01:02:06.617 --> 01:02:09.744
so if you want to wait for him...

811
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:17.252
That was Katey.

812
01:02:19.922 --> 01:02:22.173
It's okay. She's with his mother.

813
01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:23.925
Was I wrong?

814
01:02:24.802 --> 01:02:25.927
No.

815
01:02:26.721 --> 01:02:28.513
But neither was Katey.

816
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:32.350
Sometimes I wish we...

817
01:02:34.103 --> 01:02:37.063
Just try to imagine what it would be like
if we hadn't had...


818
01:02:41.527 --> 01:02:43.194
Does it make me a bad mother?

819
01:02:43.279 --> 01:02:44.779
Of course not.

820
01:02:48.367 --> 01:02:49.451
You were good.

821
01:02:49.535 --> 01:02:51.286
It's okay to miss it.

822
01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.458
They sure spiced up
our old routine, didn't they?


823
01:02:56.542 --> 01:02:57.792
I'll say.

824
01:02:58.127 --> 01:03:00.128
That wouldn't have gone over too well
at Roseland, would it?


825
01:03:00.171 --> 01:03:01.212
No.

826
01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:07.093
Bert, she's not a little girl anymore.

827
01:03:28.115 --> 01:03:29.908
What are you reading?

828
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:34.245
JosÃ© MartÃ­.

829
01:03:35.998 --> 01:03:37.123
It was my father's.

830
01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:39.292
We got rid of all his books

831
01:03:39.335 --> 01:03:41.252
just to be safe, but

832
01:03:41.378 --> 01:03:43.004
I kept this one.

833
01:03:44.673 --> 01:03:45.840
Hello.

834
01:03:46.592 --> 01:03:47.801
- Javier?
- Yeah?


835
01:03:50.012 --> 01:03:51.513
If we don't win the finals...

836
01:03:51.555 --> 01:03:52.806
We will.

837
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:55.058
But if we don't,

838
01:03:56.936 --> 01:03:59.104
I'm not gonna go
to college in six months.

839
01:04:04.151 --> 01:04:06.820
You don't know how
you're gonna feel in six months.


840
01:04:08.364 --> 01:04:09.697
Yes, I do.

841
01:04:11.534 --> 01:04:13.034
No, you don't.

842
01:04:14.411 --> 01:04:16.913
I don't want you to give up
your dreams for me.


843
01:04:17.039 --> 01:04:18.706
But I have new dreams now.

844
01:05:03.127 --> 01:05:05.628
Susie, why don't you and I
go raid that buffet by the pool?


845
01:05:06.213 --> 01:05:07.213
Sure.

846
01:05:19.602 --> 01:05:21.227
Tree looks nice.

847
01:05:27.943 --> 01:05:30.278
Your father and I discussed it.

848
01:05:34.241 --> 01:05:36.159
And we think that you should do a

849
01:05:36.952 --> 01:05:38.661
double turn at the finals.

850
01:05:41.957 --> 01:05:43.958
You like the way I danced?

851
01:05:45.377 --> 01:05:46.628
Katey.

852
01:05:48.339 --> 01:05:50.798
If you're asking me to approve
of you and this boy, I can't.


853
01:05:53.093 --> 01:05:54.594
But the dancing...

854
01:05:57.056 --> 01:05:59.015
The dancing was incredible.

855
01:06:02.311 --> 01:06:05.104
I think I should take
a little credit for that.

856
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:07.982
I think you should, too.

857
01:06:24.875 --> 01:06:26.709
Javier, these are my parents.

858
01:06:26.835 --> 01:06:28.503
Hi, Javier. It's nice to meet you.

859
01:06:28.671 --> 01:06:32.131
Nice to meet you, too. It's an honor
to meet such wonderful dancers.


860
01:06:32.466 --> 01:06:34.509
This is from my mother's garden.

861
01:06:35.177 --> 01:06:37.262
Thank you. That was sweet of you.

862
01:06:37.805 --> 01:06:39.639
- This is for you.
- Thanks.


863
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:41.015
- Ready?
- Happy New Year,


864
01:06:41.058 --> 01:06:42.433
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Yeah.


865
01:06:42.518 --> 01:06:44.852
Tonight we bring you
the three winning couples


866
01:06:44.937 --> 01:06:47.438
from the Latin ballroom competition.

867
01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:07.834
Do you wanna dance?

868
01:07:19.888 --> 01:07:21.180
Don't you dare!

869
01:07:48.584 --> 01:07:51.419
Feliz AÃ±o Nuevo, ladies and gentlemen.

870
01:07:51.545 --> 01:07:56.632
Welcome to our Latin ballroom
amateur dance contest final.


871
01:08:02.598 --> 01:08:05.183
You will dance on the stage
one couple at a time.


872
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:09.645
Tonight's winning couple will win $5,000.

873
01:08:10.022 --> 01:08:11.564
You are up first.

874
01:08:12.649 --> 01:08:14.567
Our first couple this evening

875
01:08:14.693 --> 01:08:18.613
is Mr. Jose Velarde and Miss Iris Mesa!

876
01:08:52.147 --> 01:08:53.564
Don't forget to look at the judges.

877
01:08:53.649 --> 01:08:55.441
Don't worry about the others.

878
01:08:55.651 --> 01:08:58.653
Remember, you're the queen
of La Rosa Negra.


879
01:09:00.656 --> 01:09:02.990
Our final contestants this evening,

880
01:09:03.033 --> 01:09:06.411
Miss Katey Miller and Mr. 
Javier Suarez.

881
01:10:16.982 --> 01:10:18.524
He's got a gun!

882
01:10:28.994 --> 01:10:30.661
Go! I'll find you!

883
01:13:29.925 --> 01:13:31.676
Attention, all hotel guests.

884
01:13:32.177 --> 01:13:34.595
President Batista has fled the country.

885
01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.472
There is no immediate danger.

886
01:13:36.556 --> 01:13:39.934
Please contact the front desk
for further information.


887
01:14:07.129 --> 01:14:08.254
I can't believe it's real.

888
01:14:08.797 --> 01:14:10.715
Don't you wanna be out there celebrating?

889
01:14:11.258 --> 01:14:13.968
No. I wanna be right here with you.

890
01:15:21.953 --> 01:15:23.954
We didn't win the contest.

891
01:15:24.456 --> 01:15:25.539
No.

892
01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:29.418
But the consolation prize was pretty good.

893
01:15:37.302 --> 01:15:40.930
I'm so happy I can
see all this with you.

894
01:15:49.231 --> 01:15:50.356
What?

895
01:15:51.566 --> 01:15:52.817
Nothing.

896
01:15:53.819 --> 01:15:55.069
Tell me.

897
01:15:58.073 --> 01:15:59.365
Carlos,

898
01:16:00.575 --> 01:16:03.327
he always said that
when the revolution came,


899
01:16:03.411 --> 01:16:06.372
Castro will kick out
all the Yankee companies.


900
01:16:09.125 --> 01:16:11.377
But you don't really know that.

901
01:16:11.628 --> 01:16:14.421
No. I'm just saying that...

902
01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.924
What, that I might have to leave?

903
01:16:17.217 --> 01:16:18.801
It could happen.

904
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:21.262
But they wouldn't do that,

905
01:16:21.346 --> 01:16:24.765
not if the whole idea is
to give people their freedom.


906
01:16:25.016 --> 01:16:26.475
Cuban people.

907
01:16:28.603 --> 01:16:30.938
Well, then you'll come with us.

908
01:16:31.147 --> 01:16:32.481
I'm sure my dad can work it out.

909
01:16:33.483 --> 01:16:34.608
And my family?

910
01:16:34.776 --> 01:16:37.111
We'll send for them,
just like we were always gonna do.


911
01:16:37.237 --> 01:16:39.321
Katey, I wanted to leave because of Batista,

912
01:16:40.282 --> 01:16:41.448
- but now...
- But you don't know


913
01:16:41.533 --> 01:16:44.201
what life will be like here.
I mean, what if it doesn't get better?


914
01:16:46.329 --> 01:16:48.247
My father died for this.

915
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:50.291
I have to believe it will.

916
01:16:52.127 --> 01:16:54.169
I can make a difference here.

917
01:16:54.296 --> 01:16:56.046
You showed me that.

918
01:16:58.592 --> 01:17:00.926
This is my country. It's my home.

919
01:17:09.269 --> 01:17:10.769
Oh, thank God.

920
01:17:11.062 --> 01:17:12.730
Katey, are you okay?

921
01:17:14.816 --> 01:17:16.317
We're leaving?

922
01:17:16.651 --> 01:17:18.903
Yeah. Your father's making arrangements.

923
01:17:38.465 --> 01:17:40.132
Give me that comb.

924
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:44.762
When you were little,
you used to hide under the bed


925
01:17:44.846 --> 01:17:47.514
when I'd try to comb out these knots.

926
01:17:55.315 --> 01:17:57.066
Katey, your father's
been the only man in my life,


927
01:17:57.150 --> 01:18:00.069
so I don't know what it's like
to say goodbye to someone.


928
01:18:01.488 --> 01:18:02.905
Saying goodbye to dancing,

929
01:18:02.989 --> 01:18:05.074
the other love of my life,

930
01:18:08.828 --> 01:18:10.037
it broke my heart.

931
01:18:16.169 --> 01:18:18.295
Then you were born, and then Susie,

932
01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.464
and I loved you
both so much that I...

933
01:18:20.548 --> 01:18:21.674
You're saying I'll get over it.

934
01:18:21.967 --> 01:18:23.550
No, I'm not.

935
01:18:26.221 --> 01:18:28.222
No. I'm saying I know you're hurting.

936
01:18:29.599 --> 01:18:31.517
Everything's such a mess.

937
01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.688
You have a choice.

938
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.898
You can do nothing,

939
01:18:38.108 --> 01:18:40.234
you can hide under the bed.

940
01:18:41.569 --> 01:18:43.904
Or you can work through the knots.

941
01:19:07.262 --> 01:19:09.013
I'm gonna miss you.

942
01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:15.310
I'm gonna miss you, too.

943
01:19:17.355 --> 01:19:19.273
I am taking you with me.

944
01:19:20.066 --> 01:19:22.109
I am keeping you here.

945
01:19:58.563 --> 01:20:00.981
Javier once said that
dancing is about being


946
01:20:01.066 --> 01:20:03.233
exactly who you wanna be in that moment.

947
01:20:03.693 --> 01:20:05.819
Dancing with him, I realized

948
01:20:05.862 --> 01:20:08.947
I was becoming
exactly the woman I wanted to be.


949
01:20:09.324 --> 01:20:10.824
We didn't win the contest,

950
01:20:10.909 --> 01:20:13.285
but we did win something
more important to us.


951
01:20:13.495 --> 01:20:15.245
On my last night in Havana,

952
01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:18.165
we were king and
queen of La Rosa Negra.

953
01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:22.753
Hips start shakin'
and movin' all around


954
01:20:22.879 --> 01:20:25.172
Get them hips
shakin' around


955
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:28.008
Let's dirty dance right here
on the floor, girl


956
01:20:28.259 --> 01:20:30.177
Let's do our thing
Let's give 'em a show, girl


957
01:20:30.261 --> 01:20:32.513
But I don't know
Don't think they're ready for this


958
01:20:32.555 --> 01:20:34.556
Let's give it to 'em
I hope they're ready for this


959
01:20:34.641 --> 01:20:35.891
You put your hands on my hips

960
01:20:35.975 --> 01:20:37.142
I put my hand on your hips

961
01:20:37.185 --> 01:20:39.770
- Baby, I'll follow your lead
- Check it, it goes like this


962
01:20:41.314 --> 01:20:42.564
Baby, just follow the motion

963
01:20:42.649 --> 01:20:43.774
Dancing is sexual motion

964
01:20:43.858 --> 01:20:45.067
Moving with so much emotion

965
01:20:45.151 --> 01:20:46.193
We gettin' dirty now

966
01:20:46.236 --> 01:20:50.239
- It's how we dance
- It's how we dance


967
01:20:50.365 --> 01:20:52.741
Yeah, yeah, just dirty dancin'

968
01:20:53.618 --> 01:20:55.369
Just sexy dancin'

969
01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:57.079
Sexual dancin'

970
01:20:57.622 --> 01:20:59.957
- Dirty, dirty dancin'

971
01:21:00.041 --> 01:21:02.126
I just wanna be dancin'

01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:04.419
Dirty, dirty, dirty dancin'

I just wanna be dancin'

974
01:21:06.881 --> 01:21:08.632
Dirty, dirty, dirty...

Bailar

976
01:21:10.009 --> 01:21:13.387
Yo quiero baila la la la la lar

977

978
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:18.183
Shake it, shake it,

01:21:20.562 --> 01:21:22.813
We didn't know when we would see

01:21:22.897 --> 01:21:25.899
but we knew that
this wasn't our last dance.

981
01:21:26.651 --> 01:21:27.860
Let's go!
