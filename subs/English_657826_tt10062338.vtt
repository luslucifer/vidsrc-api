1
00:24:04.185 --> 00:24:05.310
Scellinc.

2
00:24:05.435 --> 00:24:06.685
Sir.

3
00:24:06.935 --> 00:24:08.060
How is the girl?

4
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.060
Everything is well, sir.

5
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.185
She sleeps soundly. Her appetite is good.
All is as it should be.


6
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.685
And the teeth?

7
00:24:20.685 --> 00:24:22.310
Everything is well, sir.

8
00:24:23.935 --> 00:24:26.435
The month's remittance has been sent.

9
00:24:27.185 --> 00:24:28.810
Do you require anything else?

10
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.060
No, sir.

11
00:24:31.935 --> 00:24:33.935
There will be no further payments.

12
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:36.935
Sir?

13
00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:40.435
You must start preparing the girl to leave.

14
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:42.935
Leave?

15
00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:52.685
You will bring her to us on
the 6th of next month, in 13 days' time.


16
00:24:55.435 --> 00:24:59.560
In the meantime,
you must teach her how to behave outside.


17
00:25:00.435 --> 00:25:02.060
Do you understand, Scellinc?

18
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.435
Yes, sir.

19
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.810
You must get used to being outside.

20
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.185
Mia!

21
00:33:14.685 --> 00:33:15.810
Mia!

22
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:01.935
Mia!

23
00:37:46.185 --> 00:37:47.310
Stop it!

24
00:37:57.185 --> 00:37:58.310
Stop!

25
00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.185
What can I get you?

26
00:42:42.185 --> 00:42:43.310
A Tripel.

27
00:43:30.435 --> 00:43:31.685
May I?

28
00:43:50.185 --> 00:43:51.310
I am a traveller, sir.

29
00:43:53.685 --> 00:43:55.310
A stranger to this city.

30
00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.185
I live far away…

31
00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.810
... in the shadow of a great cathedral.

32
00:44:13.435 --> 00:44:14.560
No matter.

33
00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.060
I think I shall join you.

34
00:44:42.935 --> 00:44:44.060
Thank you.

35
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.060
And now, sir… What is your name?

36
00:45:11.935 --> 00:45:13.560
Albert Scellinc.

37
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.185
Albert…

38
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.810
We’ve met before...  
I am sure of it.

39
00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:33.435
Although for the moment,
I can’t quite recall where…


40
00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.435
On the field of conflict, perhaps?

41
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:45.310
Covered in mud, blood and shit.

42
00:45:54.810 --> 00:46:00.310
Or was it long before… at the orphanage?

43
00:46:09.935 --> 00:46:11.060
No…

44
00:46:12.685 --> 00:46:19.435
No, in fact, I believe it was after the war…
when you had a wife.


45
00:46:21.935 --> 00:46:23.185
Wife?

46
00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:28.185
Didn’t you take a wife after the war?

47
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:34.685
I don’t have a wife!

48
00:46:37.185 --> 00:46:41.810
Marie is dead, it's true.

49
00:46:46.435 --> 00:46:48.185
But then there's the other one.

50
00:46:55.685 --> 00:46:57.060
She is waking…

51
00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:01.810
I don't have a wife!

52
00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.810
A child, then…

53
00:47:16.685 --> 00:47:18.185
... an abandoned child.

54
00:47:29.185 --> 00:47:30.435
It’s on the house.

55
00:47:32.685 --> 00:47:33.935
Thank you, Celeste.

56
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:49.435
Have you never wondered what it would be like?
To be someone else?


57
00:47:52.685 --> 00:47:56.310
Her? For example?

58
00:47:58.435 --> 00:48:01.685
Please... stop!

59
00:48:06.935 --> 00:48:08.060
No?

60
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.685
Then perhaps the lovely Celeste?

61
00:48:21.935 --> 00:48:23.060
So it’s her…

62
00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.060
I thought so.

63
00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:49.435
Marie...

64
00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.185
How is the girl?

65
00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:01.435
Everything is well, sir.

66
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.310
She sleeps soundly… Her appetite is good…

67
00:54:26.935 --> 00:54:28.685
Everything is as it should be.

68
00:54:59.435 --> 00:55:00.935
Shhhhh…

69
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.310
I know, I know.

70
00:55:12.435 --> 00:55:13.560
I’m here.

71
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:18.560
Who… are… you?

72
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:23.560
Shhhhh… Don’t try to talk.

73
00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:30.060
Go back to sleep.

74
00:55:34.935 --> 00:55:38.935
My name is Laurence.
I’m going to take care of everything.


75
00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:56.560
I want her moved to a private room.
I will cover the costs.


76
00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:01.560
What matters above all
is that she receives the very best care.


77
00:56:26.685 --> 00:56:27.810
If I might…

78
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.810
Come on, Celeste… You need to get well.

79
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.685
Good, good, good…

80
01:03:55.185 --> 01:03:57.185
You will find these satisfactory.

81
01:07:28.185 --> 01:07:32.810
We need your help… with the teeth.

82
01:07:35.435 --> 01:07:38.060
You must ask the masters for help.

83
01:07:39.435 --> 01:07:40.560
Masters?

84
01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.560
Yes, our masters!

85
01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.060
I have to leave soon…

86
01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.185
... on the 6th.

87
01:08:24.435 --> 01:08:27.310
The house has been
empty since my mother died…

88
01:08:35.935 --> 01:08:37.685
It’s too big for one person…

89
01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:46.935
The gardens will be lovely in winter.

90
01:08:58.685 --> 01:09:01.685
I’ll be honoured if you would agree
to come with me…


91
01:09:05.435 --> 01:09:06.560
... as my guest.

92
01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.685
For as long as you need.

93
01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:19.310
Is there really anything keeping you here?

94
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:43.685
Mister Scellinc?

95
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.060
Have you informed our masters?

96
01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.810
Have you informed our masters
that I need assistance?


97
01:12:54.935 --> 01:12:56.185
I don't understand.

98
01:12:56.435 --> 01:13:00.185
Have you informed our masters
that I need assistance?


99
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.810
What is the matter?

100
01:13:26.185 --> 01:13:27.935
Dirty sneaking bitch!

101
01:13:28.851 --> 01:13:31.060
- My God
- What are you doing?


102
01:16:23.685 --> 01:16:24.810
I will…

103
01:16:29.435 --> 01:16:30.810
I will go with you…

104
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.185
Do you not recognize me?

105
01:17:49.935 --> 01:17:51.310
I know who you are.

106
01:18:35.435 --> 01:18:37.060
Go and fetch the girl.

107
01:19:20.685 --> 01:19:21.810
Come.

108
01:19:23.435 --> 01:19:24.560
Mia…

109
01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.560
Put that thing away.

110
01:20:05.935 --> 01:20:07.185
On the table.

111
01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.685
Lie down on the table.

112
01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:01.435
This will take some time.

113
01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:08.310
Please leave us alone.

114
01:21:40.685 --> 01:21:41.935
Open…

115
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:46.435
Wider.

116
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:34.310
It’s a different system now.
The glass implants are permanent.


117
01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:40.060
You must attend scrupulously
to the girl’s hygiene in the days to come.


118
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.935
Saltwater will keep her mouth free of infection.

119
01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.810
If you can manage that,

120
01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:57.435
there will be no need for me
to return before your departure.


121
01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:19.185
Not long now.

122
01:29:23.435 --> 01:29:24.560
It hurts.

123
01:29:27.685 --> 01:29:28.935
Laurence, please.

124
01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:16.185
I am sure that in our life together
you will no longer feel such need of it…


125
01:32:30.185 --> 01:32:31.685
May I help you madam?

126
01:36:40.685 --> 01:36:42.060
It’s on the house.

127
01:44:56.435 --> 01:45:00.435
I have brought the
child, as I was asked.

128
01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:04.060
I am Albert Scellinc.

129
01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:20.185
Please wait in the hall.

130
01:46:01.685 --> 01:46:03.685
She has been well cared for.

131
01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.685
So I can see.

132
01:46:16.935 --> 01:46:19.560
Everything is as it should be.

133
01:46:22.185 --> 01:46:23.810
You mustn’t be afraid.

134
01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:36.185
Perfect!

135
01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:42.310
No doubt you have
papers for me to sign.

136
01:46:43.435 --> 01:46:46.810
They are waiting for you at reception.

137
01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.810
Will you be leaving anything with her?

138
01:47:01.935 --> 01:47:05.810
Your daughter.
Will you be leaving anything with her?


139
01:47:05.935 --> 01:47:07.560
She is not my daughter!

140
01:47:08.935 --> 01:47:10.560
But you’re signing for her?

141
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:12.810
I am just her keeper.

142
01:47:17.685 --> 01:47:18.810
Look!

143
01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.685
It’s a lie!

144
01:49:57.935 --> 01:49:59.018
Marie?
