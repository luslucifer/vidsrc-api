What a bunch of garbage!

9
00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.685
From the second they're born, aren't they
preparing these poor girls to be mothers?


10
00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:39.101
Think of their little dolls.

11
00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:41.935
And weddings, how do they dress
those girls up? As little brides!


12
00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:45.810
So what else would she dream about
besides walking down the aisle? Huh? What?


13
00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:48.810
Dream about studying
particle physics? You know?


14
00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.643
Hold this. This dress
needs a lot more work!


15

You know what happens
after you turn 16 for women, don't you?


16
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.185
Everyone starts to ask
if you're married or dating anyone.


17
00:00:57.768 --> 00:00:59.728
- "When are you getting married?"

"And don't let any man slip away now!"

21
00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:07.518
Why are you asking? 
Why do you care?

22
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.143
Huh? Is it any of your business?

23
00:01:10.893 --> 00:01:11.893
Anyway...

24
00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:14.560
Oh, and here's the best part.

25
00:01:14.643 --> 00:01:15.851
You know what happens,

26
00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:19.268
if you don't end up getting married?

27
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:21.101
Oh, you'll be alone until you die.

28
00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:22.601
Oh, but you'll have 11 cats.

29
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.185
Isn't there an alternative? Huh?

30
00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:28.726
Like, you know, please, can't a girl
just choose to go her own way


31
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.310
and not be married and be fine?

32
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.393
How can a man
think it's a good decision

33
00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.851
to go and get married
out of his own free will?


34
00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:37.351
How's that possible?

35
00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:40.601
It's just dumb! And it
completely lacks purpose too!


36
00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:44.601
Hey, buddy, weren't you and I
just making fun of this idiot...


37
00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:50.935
Something's gotten into this guy.

38
00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:54.435
He even looks different.
He's just weird now, but all right!


39
00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:58.060
We made fun of him for getting married.
Said it's a dumb idea. Didn't we say that?


40
00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.738
- My mind has changed about...
- About what?


41
00:02:00.768 --> 00:02:02.976
Getting married?
It's been one small year, big deal!


42
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.560
No time to start thinking of weddings,
stuff like that, Tuna!


43
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.310
How do you think it'll go?

44
00:02:10.018 --> 00:02:13.226
And then before you know it, the great
honeymoon phase is all over, dude.


45
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.143
And then everything's just monotonous,

46
00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:17.987
and you'll both gain a lot of weight,
each of you, at least 15 pounds.


47
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.185
Big fights
and blaming each other for it, man.


48
00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:25.893
Everything will end. Love,
the thrill, the passion, it's all gone.


49
00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:29.393
I mean, what do you really expect?
No marriage works out, right?


50
00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:31.226
What's the alluring thing about love?

51
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.810
Those little, tiny surprise moments.

52
00:02:33.893 --> 00:02:37.393
The harder a woman has to work for your
attention, the harder she'll fall in love.


53
00:02:37.476 --> 00:02:41.810
Actually, so, I believe expectation
is important to make love last.


54
00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:45.601
That's why no girl thinks
that having a bird in the hand,


55
00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:47.435
is greater than having one in the bush.

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:55.851
that vein is the one that pumps there,

59
00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:58.185
but, all of them
are hooked up to the heart too.

That's right, my friend.

00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:17.851
and I can demonstrate for you, hm?

155
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.430
[bride] Am I doing it right?

156
00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:23.536
[instructor] Put your left arm a little...
Like this.


157
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.143
[bride] Uh-huh.

158
00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:27.351
[upbeat dance music rises]

159
00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:32.518
I think they might be having a stroke.

160
00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:37.268
I was actually thinking something
poisoned them both but maybe a seizure.


161
00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:43.143
Beyoncé. There we go!

162
00:08:43.226 --> 00:08:44.560
[both] Ahh!

163
00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:49.726
Then come to pick
her on up... And up.

164
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.518
- [Tuna] Here we go... Oh!
- [bride] Oh no!


165
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:54.018
- Cansu!
- [Cansu] Oh! Oh no!


166
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:56.101
- He fell down pretty bad.
- I think he might be...


167
00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:59.018
- Tuna!
- Stay back. Stay back. I'm fine! I'm fine.


168
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.077
- Are you sure you're okay?
- My legs all bent... Ah!


169
00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:03.851
[Aslı] That looked awful.
He fell really bad.


170
00:09:03.935 --> 00:09:06.935
You know if he broke his leg
he might not even realize it.


171
00:09:07.018 --> 00:09:09.685
I know most men all just
have embarrassingly bad dance moves,


172
00:09:09.768 --> 00:09:11.168
but this is on a whole other level!

173
00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:12.643
[music fades out]

174
00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:15.310
Thankfully, your lover's a good dancer.

175
00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:19.310
Oh, you... You learned how to dance?

176
00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.601
All so you could impress girls!

177
00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:24.726
[chuckles] You're such a cliché!

178
00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:27.768
Only to impress one girl.

179
00:09:29.018 --> 00:09:30.601
Damla.

180
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.560
She asked me to go to a party to celebrate
her graduation while I lived in France.


181
00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:42.393
And I just... just didn't want for her to
be embarrassed, so I took a few lessons,


182
00:09:42.476 --> 00:09:44.393
- and then I began to like it.
- You like it?


183
00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:45.726
Uh-huh.

184
00:09:46.976 --> 00:09:50.643
Damla, by the way,
might be the aunt who raised me.

and you still manage to surprise me.</i>


186
00:09:56.476 --> 00:09:59.601
We've been together a year and
I can't turn my eyes away from you.

[romantic string music playing]

188
00:10:05.143 --> 00:10:06.268
Hey, Kerem,

189
00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:09.810
do you know why everyone always
thinks that you have to get married


190
00:10:09.893 --> 00:10:11.143
if you're in love with someone?

191
00:10:11.226 --> 00:10:12.601
I just don't understand it.

192
00:10:13.518 --> 00:10:14.518
You're right.

193
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.893
It makes no sense to me.

194
00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:20.935
And all those ceremonies, making big shows
over a whole lot of nothing, you know?


195
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.270
If you really wanna go get married,
make the ceremony very quick and small.


196
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:27.476
Right, if you really have to marry him...

197
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.685
you should just get married with only
your closest friends on a beach, right?


198
00:10:32.518 --> 00:10:35.393
- Only if you have to do it?
- In my head, it's unnecessary.


199
00:10:39.685 --> 00:10:42.560
I didn't know that you were
so opposed to getting married.


200
00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:43.976
That surprises you?

201
00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:46.893
Because a very strong and confident woman

202
00:10:46.976 --> 00:10:48.696
just might be fine on her own
and not marry?


203
00:10:49.268 --> 00:10:50.935
It's because you're perfection.

204
00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.435
Am I, huh? [giggles]

205
00:10:53.935 --> 00:10:57.018
But I just can't show the girls
that marriage is a bad idea though.


206
00:10:57.685 --> 00:10:59.226
I've been telling the boys the same.

207
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.435
Just imagine that we're married,

208
00:11:01.518 --> 00:11:03.935
and everything that
we've wanted to do is just a huge bore.


209
00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:07.393
No love. No thrill at all.

210
00:11:08.976 --> 00:11:11.851
[whispering] But you would never think it...

211
00:11:16.268 --> 00:11:17.976
It makes your sex life much worse too.

212
00:11:18.685 --> 00:11:20.851
- Course it would be!
- It's less sex, not more!


213
00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:24.476
You know just being under the same roof
makes couples argue.


214
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.976
No time for sex like that.

215
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.768
I guess there really isn't, is there?
[giggles]

I won't have to marry you.

I thought that you didn't want
to get married to him.


222

What's making you so angry then?

This time,
I'm the one who needs it explained.


224

Yeah, not marrying's perfectly fine, but...

225
00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:05.476
But not marrying me is
a big mistake to make.


226
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.476
But I should be the one
to make that choice.

[rock music playing]

228

you that your poor ankle's only sprained?


229

That's what the doctor said.

I trust my medical practice.

00:12:24.518 --> 00:12:26.935
The doctor really told you
that you only sprained your ankle


233
00:12:27.018 --> 00:12:29.351
and yet you have
to have that thing on?

he should wait to get married.

Thinks it's a bunch of bull.

denying me in marriage?

I don't even wanna get married to you!
It doesn't matter!

to get married to me he says!

I've got some news,
I don't want to get married too!

the last hour. Should we be worried?

Yeah, not marrying's perfectly fine, but...

But not marrying me
is just a big mistake, right?

I should be the one who makes
that mistake. Me! [crazed giggling]

we should be right about now.

want to go and get married?

mean anything to you, man?

woman you think she is.

what she told me.

has to marry me right now. If she has any.


284
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.893
So let me ask you then,
why don't these men get married?


285
00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.688
Because he thinks
he's going to lose his freedom.

through his head, right?

All right, guys, why do women get married?

288
00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:19.226
First and foremost,
they're raised on it. It's in their DNA.

Let's talk about
your strange childhood later, okay?


294
00:16:29.976 --> 00:16:33.060
They know that they would have to go
and care about their family and future,


295
00:16:33.143 --> 00:16:35.018
so they try staying above that.

just to be safe, right?

00:16:54.226 --> 00:16:55.268
Did you get that?

304
00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.101
Yeah, that's good.

305
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:03.268
First of all, I will go and show him
that when we marry each other,


306
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:06.310
he'll have a great life with all his
freedom and I'll never restrict him.


307
00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:09.976
First of all, I'll show her just how
really even the idea of marriage is bad,


308
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.143
and it'll bore us to death.
Not an easy task.


309
00:17:13.518 --> 00:17:15.435
I'm going to need
both of you to help.

310
00:17:16.393 --> 00:17:17.393
Just say the word.

311
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.435
Hey. Psst.

312
00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:25.018
Let me see that.

313
00:17:25.101 --> 00:17:28.643
[phone buzzing]

314
00:17:32.101 --> 00:17:33.101
[giggles]

315
00:17:33.476 --> 00:17:35.185
- Honey?
- [Kerem] <i>Honey.</i>


316
00:17:35.768 --> 00:17:37.976
Uh, you have plans tonight
you have to make?


317
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.185
No.

318
00:17:39.268 --> 00:17:41.935
My plate is open now.
You planned something for me?


319
00:17:42.018 --> 00:17:45.143
I did but Emir is making weird
gestures at me right now though.


320
00:17:45.226 --> 00:17:47.185
There's a presentation we have to work on.

321
00:17:47.268 --> 00:17:49.393
My house might be where
I'll meet with them, and...


322
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.226
you should hang out with us if you can.
Could get boring.


323
00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:55.815
[Kerem] <i>But we'll do
something after we're done.</i>


324
00:17:55.893 --> 00:17:57.143
All right, I can come.

325
00:17:57.226 --> 00:17:59.601
Great, babe. Come by around 7:00 tonight?

326
00:17:59.685 --> 00:18:01.226
'Kay, babe.

327
00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:05.810
Okay, bros, listen to me,

328
00:18:05.893 --> 00:18:08.935
ask for a ton of difficult things
from Aslı tonight, okay?


329
00:18:09.018 --> 00:18:10.393
We'll break her.

330
00:18:10.476 --> 00:18:12.143
[sighs] This is just what I needed.

331
00:18:12.226 --> 00:18:14.702
But tonight, I can go to his house
and show off that I could be


332
00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.268
a little bit of a geisha for him.

333
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:19.060
And I said "could," so I won't
show him how I can be one.


334
00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:21.935
[playful music playing]

335
00:18:34.143 --> 00:18:35.768
- Honey?
- Darling?


336
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:36.976
Could you make some coffee?

337
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.060
[chuckles softly]

338
00:18:38.518 --> 00:18:39.643
I'll make some for you guys.

339
00:18:41.143 --> 00:18:43.435
Uh, Turkish coffee's the best, right?

340
00:18:43.518 --> 00:18:45.685
Yeah, or we could have myrrh instead?

341
00:18:45.768 --> 00:18:46.893
Myrrh, really?

342
00:18:46.976 --> 00:18:48.896
[whispering] Didn't you
tell us to go crazy, huh?


343
00:18:51.393 --> 00:18:53.393
Myrrh. Have you bought
us some myrrh, honey?


344
00:18:53.476 --> 00:18:55.601
No. No, myrrh, no. Uh...

345
00:18:55.685 --> 00:18:57.643
- Turkish is perfect.
- Yeah, man, Turkish.


346
00:18:58.268 --> 00:18:59.268
How would you like it?

347
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.060
Mm. Please no sugar.

348
00:19:01.143 --> 00:19:02.143
A bit of sugar.

349
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.768
Mine should be very sweet then.
Bunch of sugar, okay?


350
00:19:07.518 --> 00:19:08.518
Great choice.

351
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:11.018
So with, without, and one in the center.
Okay.


352
00:19:12.226 --> 00:19:15.351
Oh, babe! The machine's broken.
You'll have to make it on the stove.


353
00:19:15.935 --> 00:19:19.643
That's the only way to really
do it right. Here they come!


354
00:19:23.268 --> 00:19:25.060
[upbeat music playing]

355
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.119
- Let's have tea?
- I'll get you some tea?


356
00:19:39.143 --> 00:19:40.851
Read your mind, honey.

357
00:19:41.601 --> 00:19:43.268
[chuckles] On it!

358
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:44.976
[clears throat]

359
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.976
Oh, and babe, could
you not use tea bags?

360
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.351
Just loose tea.

361
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.268
Of course, babe, 
I already started.

362
00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:56.935
I made it a bit ago. It should be
almost done. It'll be a second.


363
00:19:57.018 --> 00:19:59.268
Can you please take that
to the kitchen too, babe?


364
00:19:59.351 --> 00:20:01.976
Oh, I can take them.
Don't worry. Let me, please. Thank you.


365
00:20:02.643 --> 00:20:05.101
- [Aslı giggles] Enough already.
- And these.


366
00:20:05.185 --> 00:20:07.351
- I'll put this over there.
- [Aslı] Uh-huh.


367
00:20:08.143 --> 00:20:09.685
I'll take these out of your way too.

368
00:20:09.768 --> 00:20:11.851
I'll show all of you guys what I can do.
[giggles]


369
00:20:13.601 --> 00:20:15.518
Dude, she's not acting like herself.

370
00:20:15.601 --> 00:20:17.281
Do you think she's possessed by something?

371
00:20:18.143 --> 00:20:18.976
What're you saying?

372
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.601
Think, buddy. Right?
Don't make me say it, man.


373
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:24.935
God forbid. You don't have any wood.

374
00:20:38.268 --> 00:20:41.976
[Aslı] Babe, when you said the boys
were coming over, I left work early.


375
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.310
I prepared you all some snacks.

376
00:20:51.643 --> 00:20:52.643
Mmm.

377
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.726
Aslı, these are all just so incredible.
Amazing. Wow.


378
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.351
Just enjoy it. 
Enjoy all those.

379
00:20:57.435 --> 00:20:59.560
So you made all of
these snacks by yourself?


380
00:21:04.185 --> 00:21:06.851
Have a few.
I'll make you all a fruit platter.


381
00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:11.518
She's very good.

382
00:21:11.601 --> 00:21:13.935
- [car beeps]
- [Emir] Thank you for everything.


383
00:21:14.018 --> 00:21:15.738
- [music ends]
- I'm waiting for the recipe.


384
00:21:18.601 --> 00:21:20.476
[Aslı chuckling] Those two are crazy.

385
00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.185
[playful music begins]

386
00:21:25.268 --> 00:21:27.726
[Aslı] <i>I'll make an excuse to
go back home on my own.</i>


387
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.060
I won't be sleeping
at his house now too.

388
00:21:30.143 --> 00:21:32.851
If he wants to sleep with me,
something has to change, girls.


389
00:21:32.935 --> 00:21:34.893
He'll pull out a ring. Just watch.

390
00:21:38.393 --> 00:21:39.393
It's late, so...

391
00:21:43.351 --> 00:21:45.143
So then, off to the bedroom?

392
00:21:46.101 --> 00:21:47.268
Uh...

393
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.768
You know I'm making a collection now,
so my rest is very needed.


394
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:53.976
I have an important meeting tomorrow.

395
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.935
I should go sleep there, all right?

396
00:22:00.393 --> 00:22:01.935
I'll dream of us though.

397
00:22:11.768 --> 00:22:12.768
[music ends]

398
00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:16.851
Plan was a huge bust.

399
00:22:17.768 --> 00:22:20.643
He just seemed to know everything
about the plan from the start.


400
00:22:22.268 --> 00:22:24.393
How would he even know
I made this master plan?


401
00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:26.476
[ominous music playing]

402
00:22:34.476 --> 00:22:37.060
But then someone
could have told him about the plan.


403
00:22:44.226 --> 00:22:45.226
What's up boys, huh?

404
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.976
You tipped off Cansu
about us making our master plan?


405
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.351
I'm telling you, please.
My lips are sealed, believe me!


406
00:22:51.435 --> 00:22:54.494
Aslı didn't know about our plan. All of us
would be already dead by now, dude!


407
00:22:54.518 --> 00:22:56.226
All right, man. 
I keep my secrets, bro.

[Tuna] <i>I didn't say anything!</i>

Do you think your names
will all fit on this one?


410
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:07.643
Darling, our resumés might fit on there.

[woman] Papa, Leyla is asking for you.

414
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:21.518
Leyla, come here. Hey...
Hey, princess. Come on, let's go.


415
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.143
I may need a baby to borrow
for the next step.


416
00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:28.351
You want a baby? 
Like a living one?

I'm going to show Kerem
what an amazing mother I can be.

no matter how hard
that stuff is for him.

421
00:23:36.601 --> 00:23:38.976
Yeah, but babies creep you out,
don't they?


422
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.518
It's not going to be permanent.

423
00:23:40.601 --> 00:23:42.393
All right,
whose baby are you going to use?


424

My big sister thinks twice about if I can
babysit before she gives her over.

- No.

- Oh, yes.

All right, thank you so much.

Okay, that's great. How about 7:00?
Sounds like a plan.

Okay, so are you going to
explain this baby to me now?

- [workers chattering]

They asked if I would watch their baby
for a couple hours,


441
00:24:49.643 --> 00:24:51.226
and, well, I just couldn't say no.

442
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.310
- A few hours?

- Hm.

That's sometimes natural.

446
00:25:00.893 --> 00:25:03.268
- Can we please talk somewhere private?
- Yes, please.


447
00:25:04.435 --> 00:25:08.476
[chuckling softly] Well, you look
so cute with it! You look so cute!

[toy squeaking]

Just tell me how to keep
this thing occupied for an hour.


450
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.560
Well, for an hour,
um... Hm. Um, I might...

451
00:25:19.018 --> 00:25:20.060
Might feed it.

452
00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:22.185
We can change its diaper.

453
00:25:22.268 --> 00:25:23.351
Put it down for a nap.

454
00:25:23.435 --> 00:25:26.726
How hard can it be, huh? It's a baby.
It's not too complicated, is it?


455
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:27.810
[baby cooing]

456
00:25:33.518 --> 00:25:34.893
Kerem?

457
00:25:34.976 --> 00:25:37.351
You look great with it.

458
00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:40.226
[Kerem] What? I... I don't even
know how to hold this thing.


459
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.185
Here, sit. [tsking]

460
00:25:42.268 --> 00:25:45.060
- [baby crying]
- [Aslı] Ah, ah, ah, ah...


461
00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:49.226
Well, who knew you could be
such a little cutie, huh, buddy?


462
00:25:49.726 --> 00:25:51.018
[baby farting loudly]

463
00:25:58.935 --> 00:26:00.351
[grunting]

464
00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:01.976
- [Kerem grunting]
- I don't feel good!


465
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.476
[groaning] Can you tell me
how such a small baby


466
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.935
can make something smell so bad?

467
00:26:07.018 --> 00:26:09.018
[moaning, coughing]

468
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:11.310
[upbeat music playing]

469
00:26:12.393 --> 00:26:13.393
[Aslı whimpering]

470
00:26:14.476 --> 00:26:16.393
Aslı! Come on, 
I'm passing out, okay?

471
00:26:16.476 --> 00:26:17.476
Impossible...

472
00:26:18.976 --> 00:26:21.685
[Aslı] <i>I'm going to show Kerem
what a great mother I can be.</i>


473
00:26:22.185 --> 00:26:23.185
I'll make it happen.

474
00:26:23.268 --> 00:26:24.601
- Okay.
- Come on.


475
00:26:28.643 --> 00:26:30.310
[giggling] It's a boy.

476
00:26:31.768 --> 00:26:33.726
- That might be important.
- No.


477
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.476
Uh, can we help out with some, um...

478
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.393
- [Kerem] Be my guest.
- [both gagging]


479
00:26:38.476 --> 00:26:40.268
- I can't, I'll throw up.
- Oh.


480
00:26:40.351 --> 00:26:41.476
[Emir gagging]

481
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.976
Everyone get down! No. Ugh.

482
00:26:44.601 --> 00:26:45.768
I've got it!

483
00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:49.268
[gasping] So smart, honey.

484
00:26:51.018 --> 00:26:53.018
[upbeat music continues]

485
00:27:11.143 --> 00:27:12.435
Super! Not so bad.

486
00:27:12.518 --> 00:27:13.643
[baby gurgling]

487
00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:15.310
And we can close it now, right?

488
00:27:16.226 --> 00:27:17.560
- [spraying]
- [Aslı gasping] Ah!


489
00:27:18.268 --> 00:27:19.476
- Hmm!
- [baby giggling]


490
00:27:20.518 --> 00:27:22.351
[upbeat music continues]

491
00:27:43.435 --> 00:27:44.560
[sighs]

492
00:27:49.518 --> 00:27:50.893
[laughs softly]

493
00:27:57.893 --> 00:27:59.893
[music fades out]

494
00:28:01.768 --> 00:28:03.560
That took it out of me.

495
00:28:04.726 --> 00:28:05.810
Me too.

496
00:28:07.976 --> 00:28:10.768
[Cansu] Well, I can't seat my aunt
and my sister-in-law together.


497
00:28:10.851 --> 00:28:13.726
They just got into a huge fight
at Mete's circumcision party.


498
00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.560
Okay, I know what to do.

499
00:28:15.643 --> 00:28:18.851
We'll seat my aunts at one table,
and my uncle and his wife at another.


500
00:28:18.935 --> 00:28:20.810
[scoffs] I can't make it work
that way either.


501
00:28:20.893 --> 00:28:23.310
It's just impossible
to make everyone feel okay,


502
00:28:23.393 --> 00:28:27.060
Honey! Do you think seating them
at different tables is a good plan?


503
00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:30.893
[exhales deeply] Aslı, no!
But I can't make it work!


504
00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:34.060
What am I supposed to do? Kerem knows
that something is going on now.


505
00:28:34.143 --> 00:28:37.143
Aslı's trying to keep something
big hidden, I know it.


506
00:28:37.226 --> 00:28:38.851
- What's he up to?
- I don't know.


507
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.101
I am just sure he knows
what I'm trying to do to him, girls.


508
00:28:42.185 --> 00:28:45.185
You sound really paranoid right now.
Well, bro, what could it be, huh?


509
00:28:45.935 --> 00:28:49.310
She might now want to marry me and
so she's trying to change my mind, right?


510
00:28:50.476 --> 00:28:52.636
Hey, man, when I said
she wanted to get married to you,


511
00:28:52.685 --> 00:28:55.976
all you said to me was, "She definitely
doesn't want to get married to me."


512
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.518
- Yeah, I told him.
- Okay, so you told him then.


513
00:28:58.601 --> 00:29:01.476
How could he know that you changed
your mind about getting married?


514
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.351
You're right. What would've changed it?

515
00:29:04.935 --> 00:29:06.560
How could he have found out?

516
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:09.476
Who cares? My newest plan's great.

517
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.226
Ladies, I have a great opportunity.

518
00:29:12.726 --> 00:29:16.226
My plan is just totally perfect now!
Perfect, girls!


519
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.851
It can't be any better!

520
00:29:17.935 --> 00:29:21.101
Our next plan involves an unhappy
couple that has a very big fight, boys.


521
00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:22.518
[balls clacking]

522
00:29:24.101 --> 00:29:25.560
Huh, do we know anyone?

523
00:29:30.851 --> 00:29:31.851
Tuna?

524
00:29:33.268 --> 00:29:35.351
Has our Emir ever shown you his wife?

525
00:29:36.268 --> 00:29:40.143
- No. Never showed me.
- [Kerem] Weird, I haven't met her either.


526
00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:42.101
Before we were friends,
you got hitched, right?


527
00:29:42.185 --> 00:29:44.393
There's no proof she even exists,
you know.


528
00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.268
Have you just been fooling us
all these years with a fake marriage?


529
00:29:49.143 --> 00:29:50.935
Look. Check out the marital status, okay?

530
00:29:51.018 --> 00:29:52.018
MARRIED

531
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.310
- [Emir] There!
- Okay. He's married.


532
00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.893
Come on, are you a sociopath or something?
Keeping her away from the public?


533
00:29:59.976 --> 00:30:01.656
Why haven't you ever introduced her to us?

534
00:30:01.726 --> 00:30:04.101
No big deal. Just a timing thing.

535
00:30:04.185 --> 00:30:05.518
For two years?

536
00:30:05.601 --> 00:30:06.726
Dude, she's not real.

537
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.185
[whispering] I see dead people.

538
00:30:08.268 --> 00:30:09.476
[Emir] Don't be ridiculous.

539
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.310
She and I have been fighting, bro.
Please, I don't need this now.


540
00:30:13.435 --> 00:30:15.685
- You've been fighting?
- Yeah, it's bad. Constantly.


541
00:30:15.768 --> 00:30:19.351
It's gotten really bad now.
Can't go a minute without arguing...


542
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.976
Oh, no. No way.

543
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.268
Come on, man.

544
00:30:26.185 --> 00:30:27.185
Tuna?

545
00:30:27.601 --> 00:30:28.726
That's our plan.

546
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.518
[Ezgi] Oh, wow! 
That's a great plan.

547
00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:33.521
I think your parents
are just the perfect couple.


548
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.810
So compatible. 
They're amazing.

549
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:41.060
And both still love each other
like they just got married yesterday.


550
00:30:42.685 --> 00:30:44.310
Aw, that's so cute!

551
00:30:44.393 --> 00:30:47.268
Uh... Oh, aren't they in Izmir or something?

552
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.976
Yeah, they were, but that's
why I said it's a great opportunity.


553
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.185
They're visiting tonight so I can
introduce Kerem to the both of them.


554
00:30:54.268 --> 00:30:56.628
I haven't seen them
for a couple months. I really miss them.


555
00:30:56.685 --> 00:30:59.310
[Kerem] You're coming to my place
tomorrow, Emir. Understand me?


556
00:30:59.893 --> 00:31:01.351
Tuna, you should come too.

557
00:31:01.435 --> 00:31:04.351
You know that Aslı might be a little
suspicious of this whole thing.


558
00:31:04.435 --> 00:31:07.726
Dude, please, it's bad. It's not
a good time. This timing's bad, okay?


559
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.101
Yeah, man. That's perfect for what I need.

560
00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:12.810
You'll fight so Aslı can see a big,
bad fight and scare her off.


561
00:31:12.893 --> 00:31:13.726
Perfect.

562
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.185
Come on, dude, translate.

563
00:31:15.268 --> 00:31:18.518
Come on. You owe me.
It's time now for you to pay back.


564
00:31:18.601 --> 00:31:20.744
- Hey, you can't just make up that stuff.
- Sure you do.


565
00:31:20.768 --> 00:31:22.685
[phone ringing]

566
00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:29.476
Honey? I was just about to call you.

567
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.643
Uh... I have great news.

568
00:31:31.726 --> 00:31:35.060
Emir and his lovely wife are
planning on going over to my place.


569
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:38.560
He wanted us to meet before the wedding.
Uh, Cansu and Tuna are joining too.


570
00:31:38.643 --> 00:31:41.226
You can let Ezgi know about it.
We'll be one big...


571
00:31:43.018 --> 00:31:44.726
[tires screeching]

572
00:31:45.768 --> 00:31:46.768
What?

573
00:31:47.476 --> 00:31:48.518
So they're coming.

574
00:31:49.101 --> 00:31:51.643
- To... Tonight?
- [snickering]


575
00:31:51.726 --> 00:31:53.518
No, please, I just meant that, babe...

576
00:31:53.601 --> 00:31:55.476
- No, that would be... Uh...
- [both laughing]


577
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.810
Yeah, but... Uh... But I made other plans,
I just have to be somewhere.


578
00:32:01.268 --> 00:32:03.601
I'll be there. Your parents
come first over a dumb meeting.


579
00:32:03.685 --> 00:32:05.685
- [whispering] Sorry.
- Yeah.


580
00:32:05.768 --> 00:32:07.643
[laughing continues]

581
00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:08.810
Yeah, babe.

582
00:32:09.935 --> 00:32:10.935
All right.

583
00:32:14.643 --> 00:32:19.185
- RIP. Sorry.
- Well, the ring is appearing right on him.


584
00:32:21.185 --> 00:32:23.185
[romantic string music playing]

585
00:32:28.226 --> 00:32:30.226
No, don't loosen your collar.
Here, let me...


586
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.685
You know I despise these, babe.
I hate these ties!


587
00:32:32.768 --> 00:32:34.810
Why are you insisting
I have to wear one tonight?


588
00:32:34.893 --> 00:32:36.851
Well, it's the family,
you have to look good.


589
00:32:36.935 --> 00:32:40.185
We wouldn't want my father to think
that some random bum is dating me.


590
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:43.060
You're saying that if men
don't wear ties they're bums?


591
00:32:43.143 --> 00:32:45.935
- I think you might be stressed.
- I'm totally calm. Really calm.


592
00:32:46.018 --> 00:32:47.893
I was just about to
ask you the same thing.


593
00:32:47.976 --> 00:32:49.935
No, sir. I'm the one who's really calm.

594
00:32:50.018 --> 00:32:52.476
- Oh, don't be super scared, okay?
- Okay, I'm not. I'm not!


595
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.768
My papa is very strict, and he's
very disciplined about some stuff,


596
00:32:55.851 --> 00:32:57.685
but he's such a good man.

597
00:32:57.768 --> 00:33:00.185
And also, you know, both my parents are

598
00:33:00.268 --> 00:33:02.685
really still as much
in love as they were years ago.


599
00:33:02.768 --> 00:33:04.851
I haven't seen
the two of them argue even once


600
00:33:04.935 --> 00:33:06.435
because they love each other so much!

601
00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:08.118
Trust me, you'll see when they get here.

602
00:33:08.143 --> 00:33:09.935
- [horn honking]
- [gasps] Oh, they're here!


603
00:33:10.518 --> 00:33:11.518
[gasps]

604
00:33:13.476 --> 00:33:14.476
Darling?

605
00:33:16.143 --> 00:33:18.101
I think you are nervous! [laughing]

606
00:33:20.435 --> 00:33:21.810
You're totally nervous!

607
00:33:23.268 --> 00:33:25.310
- Here they are! Oh!
- [light fixture clanging]


608
00:33:29.351 --> 00:33:32.226
All right, come here. 
Don't be shy, okay.

609
00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:40.851
[mother sighing]

610
00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:42.726
- Hi, welcome.
- Hi, my love.


611
00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.935
- Mommy! Mwah!
- Oh, my baby!


612
00:33:45.018 --> 00:33:46.601
[Aslı] I've missed you so much!

613
00:33:47.101 --> 00:33:49.560
Mom, this is my boyfriend, Kerem.
Kerem, Canan.


614
00:33:49.643 --> 00:33:52.893
- [Kerem] Hello, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too. Pleasure.


615
00:33:52.976 --> 00:33:54.226
- Okay.
- Papa's not here?


616
00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.935
- Uh... There he goes.
- [rumbling engine approaching]


617
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.310
[rock music playing]

618
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.143
Servet, but...

619
00:34:16.893 --> 00:34:18.851
No hugs for big papa, huh? [laughing]

620
00:34:18.935 --> 00:34:20.768
- My papa?
- [music ends]


621
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.351
Oh. Aw, there you are honey.

622
00:34:26.685 --> 00:34:28.351
- What's up?
- Papa?


623
00:34:29.018 --> 00:34:30.018
Kerem?

624
00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:32.393
How are you, Mr. Ercüment?

625
00:34:32.476 --> 00:34:35.768
Please... Ercüment, please, that's
not my name, okay? "Ercü's" better.


626
00:34:36.851 --> 00:34:37.851
You manage a bank?

627
00:34:39.393 --> 00:34:40.518
A banker, wait...

628
00:34:40.601 --> 00:34:42.994
- I thought that mom said advertising.
- No, no that's my job.


629
00:34:43.018 --> 00:34:44.851
What's up with the suit, then?

630
00:34:45.726 --> 00:34:47.393
But... A meeting before this.

631
00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:49.685
Come on, meeting's over, man.
Hold this a sec.


632
00:34:49.768 --> 00:34:53.310
Let's just undo this button.
Undo it. Just relax. Relax. Ha!


633
00:34:53.393 --> 00:34:55.768
Oof, come on, you're big. Let's go.
All right?


634
00:34:55.851 --> 00:34:57.351
[Aslı chuckles awkwardly]

635
00:34:58.226 --> 00:35:00.226
- [Ercü] How tall are you, bro?
- He said "bro."


636
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.976
- [Kerem] Six foot three.
- Unbelievable. An inch taller than me.


637
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:08.643
Um... Papa's different now.

638
00:35:09.143 --> 00:35:10.143
Andropause did it.

639
00:35:10.185 --> 00:35:11.060
What?

640
00:35:11.143 --> 00:35:13.310
He's gone. Lost it!

641
00:35:13.393 --> 00:35:14.685
[sighs deeply]

642
00:35:15.893 --> 00:35:17.018
[whimpering]

643
00:35:19.101 --> 00:35:20.435
But why me?

644
00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:22.476
No way you're taller than me, son.

645
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.726
- [Kerem] I...
- You're not.


646
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.101
[Kerem] I'm probably not.
We might be the same...


647
00:35:26.185 --> 00:35:29.268
- I'm six foot, two inches. Uh, my friend.
- Uh, y-yes.


648
00:35:29.351 --> 00:35:30.393
Take a pic with me.

649
00:35:30.476 --> 00:35:31.726
[playful music starting]

650
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.351
- Sure.
- Okay.


651
00:35:34.018 --> 00:35:37.185
No. My dear,
I can't take it, or I'll faint!


652
00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:40.351
Take this now. Here. Yeah.

653
00:35:40.435 --> 00:35:41.643
You have alcohol?

654
00:35:41.726 --> 00:35:44.476
Yeah, I do. But shouldn't we eat first?

655
00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:47.476
- [Ercü] That one's not good.
- Aslı, dear. Please,


656
00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:52.060
I will need a drink to put up with
this man or I will lose my head! Hm?


657
00:35:52.143 --> 00:35:53.143
Understand?

658
00:35:53.185 --> 00:35:56.935
- I look great, but you don't look so good.
- So just screw making me dinner.


659
00:35:57.018 --> 00:35:58.101
[camera clicking]

660
00:35:58.601 --> 00:36:00.393
Instagram follow me, okay, man?

661
00:36:01.851 --> 00:36:03.435
Papa made an Instagram?

662
00:36:03.518 --> 00:36:06.518
Yeah. He even bought more followers there.

663
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:07.518
Huh?

664
00:36:07.601 --> 00:36:10.435
Ah, Aslı, okay. Alcohol.
Alcohol, darling. Please, let's go.


665
00:36:10.518 --> 00:36:12.768
Let's go.
Let's make that drink. Make it strong.


666
00:36:12.851 --> 00:36:14.518
- Strong.
- Check the profile.


667
00:36:14.601 --> 00:36:16.310
- It's on fire, right?
- Oh, yeah.


668
00:36:16.393 --> 00:36:18.101
It's really great, Mr. Ercüment.

669
00:36:18.185 --> 00:36:19.435
Call me "Ercü," okay, please.

670
00:36:20.018 --> 00:36:23.226
[chuckles] My fault, I will.
Ercüment. Uh, Ercü.


671
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.185
[Canan sighs]

672
00:36:24.268 --> 00:36:26.476
Go. Go ahead. Pour.

673
00:36:28.018 --> 00:36:32.018
Now, okay, did Papa just someday
become a completely different guy?


674
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:35.018
- [groans]
- Why? Out with it.


675
00:36:35.101 --> 00:36:36.143
I'll tell you.

676
00:36:36.226 --> 00:36:40.101
So, okay, the first thing was buying
all these stylish young people clothes.


677
00:36:40.893 --> 00:36:44.268
Sure, I was uneasy around him.
Oh, but I didn't say a thing to him.


678
00:36:45.393 --> 00:36:47.393
Mm. Mmm.

679
00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:50.726
Then he just bought
a new car, and... Yeah!

680
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.310
He got a convertible.
A brand-new sports car.


681
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:54.810
Oh, Aslı.

682
00:36:54.893 --> 00:36:59.351
Aslı, you have to see the thing.
He looks so awkward in it. So awkward!


683
00:36:59.435 --> 00:37:01.185
You already saw the motorcycle.

684
00:37:01.268 --> 00:37:02.976
- [softly] Uh-huh.
- [sighs]


685
00:37:04.393 --> 00:37:07.018
Anyway, after that...
The way he talks, the way he walks,


686
00:37:07.101 --> 00:37:09.143
his mannerisms even are just so ugh!

687
00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:12.185
[voice breaking] He's gone. He's gone.

688
00:37:12.268 --> 00:37:13.560
Like the triceps?

689
00:37:13.643 --> 00:37:15.976
Wow, those are really,
very good for a guy of your age.


690
00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.185
A guy what?

691
00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:20.560
- [stammering] They're amazing. Super fit.
- Oh, please, feel. Do you do kato?


692
00:37:20.643 --> 00:37:24.601
- [stammering] I don't like that form.
- Oh! Kato's great! It'll make ya sore.


693
00:37:24.685 --> 00:37:26.285
- I'm not sure.
- You'll get really sore.


694
00:37:26.351 --> 00:37:27.476
Just take me as an example.

695
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.893
- Yeah, sure, you're right.
- Huh?


696
00:37:28.976 --> 00:37:30.810
You're good. Hey, show me yours.

697
00:37:30.893 --> 00:37:33.518
- Uh, no, but it's my privacy.
- Come on, show me.


698
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:35.810
- No. Mr. Ercüment, I... Ercü...
- I'm begging you.


699
00:37:35.893 --> 00:37:37.143
Show me. Come on.

700
00:37:37.226 --> 00:37:41.185
- No, please. I...
- [chanting] Kerem, Kerem, Kerem...


701
00:37:41.268 --> 00:37:43.893
- I want to be divorced now!
- [rock music starting]


702
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.143
So it's over?

703
00:37:53.143 --> 00:37:55.143
Well, I'll see ya. 
We can go ride.

704
00:38:09.435 --> 00:38:10.685
[rock music fades out]

705
00:38:11.268 --> 00:38:14.310
- I'll expect that sample soon.
- [man] Okay. Thank you.


706
00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:23.060
Oh! What are you two still doing here?
I'll see you tonight.


707
00:38:23.643 --> 00:38:25.893
I'm trying to get
the collection ready right now.


708
00:38:25.976 --> 00:38:29.101
I neglected work while I was busy with
your wedding and our plans and games.


709
00:38:29.685 --> 00:38:31.810
Now we have a really big surprise.
A great big one!


710
00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:33.268
To surprise me, huh?

711
00:38:33.351 --> 00:38:34.851
You'll see in a second.

712
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.351
- You miss me?
- [squealing]


713
00:38:39.435 --> 00:38:40.935
- [Cansu] Here he is!
- Ah!


714
00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:42.351
- [Aslı] Bulut!
- [Bulut laughing]


715
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.851
- How did you...? What are you doing here?
- Ah!


716
00:38:48.518 --> 00:38:50.851
- You two!
- [women giggling]


717
00:38:50.935 --> 00:38:52.143
Hmm.

718
00:38:53.268 --> 00:38:55.226
- [Bulut] I've missed you.
- [Ezgi] How are you?


719
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:56.310
I'm good.

720
00:38:57.351 --> 00:38:59.060
You look the same as before.

721
00:38:59.143 --> 00:39:01.393
Honestly, I think you got even prettier.

722
00:39:01.476 --> 00:39:03.976
- Aw, no I didn't. Stop.
- [all giggling]


723
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.060
- I've just missed my ladies.
- We've missed you so much. Really.


724
00:39:07.643 --> 00:39:09.393
Didn't think you'd be able to get here.

725
00:39:09.476 --> 00:39:12.143
I'm so glad you came. 
This is so exciting!

726
00:39:12.226 --> 00:39:15.060
My baby Cansu's wedding party is
something I wouldn't miss, my friends.


727
00:39:15.143 --> 00:39:18.060
- [squeals] Married, wow!
- [Aslı] Yeah, you're getting married.


728
00:39:19.476 --> 00:39:22.351
This place is just... 
It's really nice.

729
00:39:27.185 --> 00:39:29.935
You finally had the guts to create
a new brand all for yourself, huh?


730
00:39:30.518 --> 00:39:31.643
It was time for it.

731
00:39:32.268 --> 00:39:34.351
- Amazing work.
- Thank you.


732
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.310
Aslı?

733
00:39:37.768 --> 00:39:38.976
These are stunning.

734
00:39:39.935 --> 00:39:41.893
It's amazing to get compliments
out of you,


735
00:39:41.976 --> 00:39:43.726
as such a big, acclaimed, worldwide brand.

736
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.435
Thank you for saying It,
but don't say it just to make me happy.


737
00:39:46.518 --> 00:39:48.143
You know how I
am when I talk business.

738
00:39:49.101 --> 00:39:50.893
I wouldn't just say that
to make you happy.


739
00:39:50.976 --> 00:39:51.810
[chuckles]

740
00:39:51.893 --> 00:39:54.393
- All right, let's sit down and talk.
- [Ezgi] Sit.


741
00:39:54.476 --> 00:39:55.685
Should we have drinks?

742
00:39:58.226 --> 00:40:00.327
All right, your turn.
Tell me, how's life? How're you?


743
00:40:00.351 --> 00:40:03.935
[sighs] Tiring. Well, half a year Dubai,
half a year New York.


744
00:40:04.018 --> 00:40:05.393
Few trips in between.

745
00:40:05.476 --> 00:40:08.101
Oh, Bulut. Oh, now, you poor man.
Now I feel bad!


746
00:40:08.185 --> 00:40:11.143
Right? So many trips.
How do you do it, poor guy?


747
00:40:11.768 --> 00:40:12.768
Please, let's grab food.

748
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.518
I'll tell you all about my difficult life.

749
00:40:15.601 --> 00:40:18.893
Well, we actually have some plans
made for this evening, Bulut, but...


750
00:40:18.976 --> 00:40:20.060
Kerem's hosting.

751
00:40:20.893 --> 00:40:22.143
Kerem?

752
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:25.018
[whispering] We're together.

753
00:40:27.476 --> 00:40:29.476
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah!


754
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.310
And his name is really Kerem?

755
00:40:32.518 --> 00:40:35.685
[laughing] Come on. You all
must have made fun of this before.


756
00:40:35.768 --> 00:40:39.435
The tragic love story! Someone always
makes up bad jokes wherever we go.


757
00:40:39.518 --> 00:40:44.268
Okay, then. So someone
finally made the cut to date you, huh?


758
00:40:45.393 --> 00:40:47.310
Now, I want to meet Kerem. I must.

759
00:40:48.226 --> 00:40:50.185
If you think it's hard,
you're probably right.


760
00:40:50.268 --> 00:40:51.685
Imagine that.

761
00:40:51.768 --> 00:40:53.601
Bulut, stop messing around. [laughing]

762
00:40:53.685 --> 00:40:57.185
If he still doesn't bring his wife,
I'll use work to punish his ass.


763
00:40:57.268 --> 00:40:59.560
- Dude, he doesn't have a wife, you know?
- [Aslı] Kerem?


764
00:40:59.643 --> 00:41:02.851
- [Ezgi laughing] Hey!
- [Kerem] Hey, welcome!


765
00:41:03.935 --> 00:41:05.310
A man?

766
00:41:05.393 --> 00:41:07.726
Looks like we have an outsider among us.

767
00:41:08.435 --> 00:41:09.518
New to me.

768
00:41:11.851 --> 00:41:13.351
- [Kerem] Honey.
- [Aslı] Baby.


769
00:41:14.476 --> 00:41:16.185
Here, I'll introduce you two.

770
00:41:16.268 --> 00:41:19.643
Bulut, my childhood friend.
He came from Dubai for Cansu's wedding.


771
00:41:19.726 --> 00:41:21.744
- How are you? Kerem, my friend.
- Thanks, my friend.


772
00:41:21.768 --> 00:41:23.726
Sorry for coming over
uninvited like this, buddy.


773
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:25.685
- Don't even mention it. Please.
- Thank you.


774
00:41:25.768 --> 00:41:29.101
[squealing loudly] It's so great
that you're here with us.


775
00:41:29.185 --> 00:41:30.310
[squeals]

776
00:41:31.018 --> 00:41:32.768
- Follow me.
- Yeah, good plan. Here.


777
00:41:32.851 --> 00:41:34.643
[Cansu exclaims excitedly]

778
00:41:39.476 --> 00:41:42.476
Hey, what's got her acting like that?
What the hell?


779
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.560
[R&B music playing]

780
00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:19.310
No way.

781
00:42:36.935 --> 00:42:39.226
They just photoshopped
a model next to Emir, bro.


782
00:42:48.851 --> 00:42:50.851
[music fades out]

783
00:42:51.685 --> 00:42:53.726
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce my wife, Feride.


784
00:42:55.351 --> 00:42:56.518
Hi, there. Kerem.

785
00:42:56.601 --> 00:42:58.411
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.


786
00:42:58.435 --> 00:42:59.435
Feride, wow.

787
00:42:59.518 --> 00:43:01.310
So her name's Feride is it?

788
00:43:01.393 --> 00:43:05.018
More like she's a Bella, you know...
A Kendall. A Gigi.


789
00:43:05.518 --> 00:43:06.726
My friends call me Tuna.

790
00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.070
- Nice to meet you, Tuna.
- Pleasure, really.


791
00:43:09.101 --> 00:43:10.560
[Feride giggling]

792
00:43:11.976 --> 00:43:14.018
Oh, oh! Feride?

793
00:43:14.101 --> 00:43:15.976
- Aslı? [squealing]
- Is this real?


794
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.952
- [Emir] What's going on here?
- [Tuna] Hey, man...


795
00:43:17.976 --> 00:43:20.435
Please, just tell me. Be honest.
If she's a model, tell me.


796
00:43:20.518 --> 00:43:23.810
- I'll murder you. Do something, bro.
- He's right. We'll talk about it later.


797
00:43:23.893 --> 00:43:25.560
[Aslı] I can't believe it's been so long!

798
00:43:25.643 --> 00:43:27.518
- Yeah, and look at this.
- What man?


799
00:43:29.143 --> 00:43:30.226
Emir?

800
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.351
[giggling]

801
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.268
[gasping] Bulut?

802
00:43:34.185 --> 00:43:35.310
Feride?

803
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.101
- How are you?
- What happened?


804
00:43:38.351 --> 00:43:39.685
- Kerem?
- Emir?


805
00:43:39.768 --> 00:43:41.893
- Tuna?
- Not our business, baby. Relax.


806
00:43:41.976 --> 00:43:44.935
[Aslı] Uh, this is a crazy coincidence!

807
00:43:45.018 --> 00:43:47.393
Uh, we went to
the same high school with Feride.


808
00:43:47.476 --> 00:43:49.351
It's been so long since
we've seen each other.


809
00:43:49.435 --> 00:43:52.685
Wow, that's great. Very interesting stuff.
Um, who's he?


810
00:43:54.476 --> 00:43:56.643
- Who?
- [Emir] The guy in front of you.


811
00:43:56.726 --> 00:43:59.810
He looks like Adonis. Like he's
a freakin' Greek sculpture. Come on.


812
00:43:59.893 --> 00:44:02.476
- Oh, Bulut. Oh, he's...
- Bulut and I dated.


813
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.976
Just briefly in high school, but yeah.

814
00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:06.685
You dated?

815
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.851
- Come on, man.
- Should we sit down?


816
00:44:11.935 --> 00:44:13.175
I'll go hang out with them now.

817
00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.393
- Dude, relax.
- [grunts]


818
00:44:16.851 --> 00:44:19.185
- It's a stroke.
- Just let him go. He's gone.


819
00:44:19.268 --> 00:44:21.228
If you're hungry,
I'll make plates for you and me.


820
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.310
- She's not hungry!
- I think I have lockjaw, guys.


821
00:44:24.393 --> 00:44:25.476
[Emir moaning]

822
00:44:26.726 --> 00:44:27.935
[Tuna] You okay?

823
00:44:28.935 --> 00:44:30.060
Should we brawl?

824
00:44:32.393 --> 00:44:33.893
[Aslı] This all feels like a joke.

825
00:44:33.976 --> 00:44:37.560
I mean, the mysterious wife
of my boyfriend's best friend


826
00:44:37.643 --> 00:44:41.560
just happens to be one of my best friends
that I had during my childhood.


827
00:44:41.643 --> 00:44:44.226
Emir mentioned an Aslı,
but I assumed my luck would never be


828
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.310
that great that I would see you again.

829
00:44:46.393 --> 00:44:49.310
Sounds like toast time then.
To best friends reunited, huh?


830
00:44:49.393 --> 00:44:51.202
- [glasses clinking]
- [Aslı] Cheers, everyone!


831
00:44:51.226 --> 00:44:52.560
[Feride laughing]

832
00:44:54.435 --> 00:44:57.893
By the way, you told Emir about
being a pair during high school?


833
00:44:57.976 --> 00:45:01.101
I mean, we only dated a week.
We didn't even hold hands.


834
00:45:01.185 --> 00:45:02.768
He was about to have a heart attack.

835
00:45:02.851 --> 00:45:06.060
Emir and I are just in a really bad
place recently. We're fighting a lot.


836
00:45:06.143 --> 00:45:07.643
Made him a little jealous of nothing!

837
00:45:08.851 --> 00:45:12.393
- Good tactic. Very smart move.
- [Feride giggling]


838
00:45:13.226 --> 00:45:15.226
Tomorrow night's party all figured out?

839
00:45:16.143 --> 00:45:18.601
Honey, please, let's pick
something else to talk about, yeah?


840
00:45:18.685 --> 00:45:20.645
Everything is under control.
Don't worry about it.


841
00:45:20.726 --> 00:45:21.810
So what's tomorrow night?

842
00:45:22.393 --> 00:45:26.101
Yeah, Cansu's bachelorette party's
coming up soon, and I'm organizing it.


843
00:45:26.185 --> 00:45:28.351
But what is it? 
What's the big deal?

844
00:45:28.435 --> 00:45:29.768
Where are we going?

845
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:32.268
I ask you all the time
and you just try to brush it off.


846
00:45:32.351 --> 00:45:34.494
Can't be that hard. I mean,
there's only so many places


847
00:45:34.518 --> 00:45:36.018
to have a party like this, right?

848
00:45:36.101 --> 00:45:37.768
We'll go somewhere and have fun.

849
00:45:37.851 --> 00:45:41.101
Oh, so we're just doing whatever?
Please tell me you're joking.


850
00:45:41.185 --> 00:45:44.435
- That's the plan?
- Yeah. Please, if you have better ideas...


851
00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:48.060
Come on, Aslı. Really.

852
00:45:48.143 --> 00:45:50.411
- [melancholy music plays]
- We get that this wedding stuff,


853
00:45:50.435 --> 00:45:54.393
and that having a huge party just for it
doesn't really mean anything to you.


854
00:45:54.476 --> 00:45:56.768
And you know that we respect that.

855
00:45:57.768 --> 00:46:00.310
But Cansu thinks this is
an important party, so...


856
00:46:02.018 --> 00:46:04.851
And you need to show
the same level of respect for her.


857
00:46:07.518 --> 00:46:10.851
But you've been very condescending
about Cansu getting married.


858
00:46:14.518 --> 00:46:15.685
I'm just saying,

859
00:46:16.435 --> 00:46:18.768
Cansu just wanted to feel special.

860
00:46:18.851 --> 00:46:22.101
Something that shows her
that you remembered how much she cares.


861
00:46:26.476 --> 00:46:28.560
[voice breaking] You're right. Of course.

862
00:46:28.643 --> 00:46:30.060
I should've... [sniffles]

863
00:46:31.268 --> 00:46:33.685
Oh no, I'm awful.
I'm awful. I'm gonna... I gotta go now!


864
00:46:33.768 --> 00:46:36.488
- I have to go right now!
- Wait, where are you going? Just sit down.


865
00:46:36.518 --> 00:46:38.810
- [Aslı] No. It's over!
- [Feride] Where would you go?


866
00:46:38.893 --> 00:46:40.573
[Aslı gasps] I'm in
the middle of the sea.

867
00:46:40.643 --> 00:46:42.911
- [Feride laughing]
- [Aslı] What am I supposed to do now?


868
00:46:42.935 --> 00:46:45.101
It's bad! I really am awful.
I can't believe...


869
00:46:45.185 --> 00:46:47.065
Just calm down.
We can still make it work, okay?


870
00:46:47.101 --> 00:46:48.893
We won't. It's hopeless, 
I'm sure of it!

871
00:46:48.976 --> 00:46:50.435
Calm down, please. Just relax.

872
00:46:50.518 --> 00:46:53.518
I have an idea, but not sure
if you'll like my plan though.


873
00:46:53.601 --> 00:46:55.761
- We bring her to my island.
- Oh, go to your island...


874
00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.185
- Wait, an island?
- Yeah.


875
00:46:57.268 --> 00:46:58.560
It has a hotel on it.

876
00:46:58.643 --> 00:47:00.851
- What?
- [Aslı] A hotel?


877
00:47:00.935 --> 00:47:03.601
- [Bulut] Mm-hm.
- Oh, you are a lifesaver!


878
00:47:03.685 --> 00:47:06.143
Wow! Unbelievable! 
He has an island!

879
00:47:06.226 --> 00:47:09.060
We have an island!
Well, I guess we should make a list!


880
00:47:09.143 --> 00:47:12.226
Oh, we have to make plans.
What kind of an event should it be?


881
00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.893
- Who should we invite? Like...
- Okay.


882
00:47:13.976 --> 00:47:17.893
...which of Cansu's friends should we...
"I have an island." Are you serious?


883
00:47:17.976 --> 00:47:19.976
[Aslı squealing] To the island!

884
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.435
[Bulut] To the island!

885
00:47:24.685 --> 00:47:27.101
[commentator on TV] <i>...bringing it on home.</i>

886
00:47:27.185 --> 00:47:30.643
<i>Ha! This guy is a real competitor.</i>

887
00:47:30.726 --> 00:47:35.226
<i>One-of-a-kind player, and certainly
a force to be reckoned with.</i>


888
00:47:36.476 --> 00:47:37.851
What's up with the two of you?

889
00:47:37.935 --> 00:47:40.435
[commentator on TV] <i>Are you seeing
what I'm seeing here?</i>


890
00:47:40.518 --> 00:47:43.101
- Kerem's completely in the dark, right?
- Hm.


891
00:47:43.185 --> 00:47:45.060
The island,
that's what you're talking about?


892
00:47:45.643 --> 00:47:48.003
- [Kerem laughing]
- Come on, this man is so calm right now.


893
00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.018
Look how calm he is!

894
00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:52.452
I've been in and out of meetings all day,
and you know what?


895
00:47:52.476 --> 00:47:55.310
Ask me if I remember anything
about what we discussed today!


896
00:47:55.393 --> 00:47:58.018
- Do you, man?
- None of it! None of it!


897
00:47:58.101 --> 00:47:59.935
Ask me why. Why I don't.

898
00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:01.143
All right, tell me...

899
00:48:01.226 --> 00:48:03.476
- Tuna, say something.
- Okay, what happened?

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:54.851
[upbeat guitar music playing]

1052
00:56:58.518 --> 00:57:00.643
- [music fades]
- [women laughing]


1053
00:57:05.101 --> 00:57:06.101
[Ezgi] Give me one too.

1054
00:57:06.185 --> 00:57:09.476
I can't wait to party
with you all tonight, you know.


1055
00:57:09.976 --> 00:57:12.060
I know that you'll like it.
It's gonna be great.


1056
00:57:14.018 --> 00:57:15.976
[boat engine rumbling]

1057
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.143
[upbeat music playing]

1058
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:20.060
Ladies?

1059
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.810
So, mirages don't
really happen out here, but...


1060
00:57:23.893 --> 00:57:26.018
[giggling] So I'll meet Mirage soon?

1061
00:57:28.435 --> 00:57:33.101
Oh! Those guys on that boat look
exactly like Tuna, Emir, and Kerem!


1062
00:57:33.185 --> 00:57:34.185
[Aslı] Right?

1063
00:57:34.935 --> 00:57:36.268
Big brain question here.

1064
00:57:36.351 --> 00:57:38.851
Did it occur to you
that all of those men look similar


1065
00:57:38.935 --> 00:57:43.018
since they're the same ones that we know,
not because they look exactly identical?


1066
00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.018
- Well, yeah, it has.
- That's great.


1067
00:57:47.851 --> 00:57:50.143
- I can't believe they followed us here!
- [Feride] Crazy.


1068
00:57:50.226 --> 00:57:51.768
The party's just beginning!

1069
00:57:52.518 --> 00:57:53.518
[Cansu] They're here.

1070
00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.060
[Cansu] Here they come.

1071
00:58:04.018 --> 00:58:05.601
[Kerem] Like we planned.

1072
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:15.744
- [Feride] Prince of the boat!
- [music fades out]


1073
00:58:15.768 --> 00:58:17.935
[Emir] Baby, I came for you.

1074
00:58:18.018 --> 00:58:22.685
- I came here for you, babe!
- Baby, I'm so glad! I really missed you!


1075
00:58:22.768 --> 00:58:25.060
- [Tuna] I missed you.
- [Tuna and Cansu kissing loudly]


1076
00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.601
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, stranger.


1077
00:58:28.101 --> 00:58:29.310
Good to see you.

1078
00:58:29.893 --> 00:58:33.018
We were already in Marmaris
for Tuna's bachelor party.


1079
00:58:33.101 --> 00:58:35.741
We thought we'd just surprise you
by making the trek to this place.


1080
00:58:35.768 --> 00:58:38.976
- Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm sure, right?
- Didn't I tell you she wouldn't buy it?


1081
00:58:39.768 --> 00:58:42.518
I will break your legs.
Break all of them, I promise you.


1082
00:58:42.601 --> 00:58:44.060
That boat you got?

1083
00:58:44.143 --> 00:58:46.393
Did you put some thought into it?

1084
00:58:46.476 --> 00:58:48.685
- Isn't it great? It's cool.
- So cool.


1085
00:58:49.851 --> 00:58:52.685
Look at this. What a surprise, my friend.

1086
00:58:53.601 --> 00:58:55.601
- Thanks, my friend, how are you?
- Good, you?


1087
00:58:55.685 --> 00:58:56.685
Great.

1088
00:58:59.643 --> 00:59:01.726
Come on, man,
just undo some of those buttons.


1089
00:59:02.768 --> 00:59:05.560
We're having a little party tonight,
and since you came all this way,


1090
00:59:05.643 --> 00:59:06.935
would you please join us?

1091
00:59:08.185 --> 00:59:09.768
Um, I don't see why not.

1092
00:59:09.851 --> 00:59:10.935
Okay. Why not?

1093
00:59:11.018 --> 00:59:12.393
Sounds like lots of fun.

1094
00:59:12.476 --> 00:59:13.643
It's drink time then.

1095
00:59:14.435 --> 00:59:16.518
[Aslı] Yeah, let's have a few drinks!

1096
00:59:17.101 --> 00:59:19.101
[upbeat music restarts]

1097
00:59:27.435 --> 00:59:28.810
[music fades out]

1098
00:59:33.476 --> 00:59:35.143
- We thought you'd like it.
- [gasping]


1099
00:59:35.226 --> 00:59:36.310
It's perfect.

1100
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.060
Aslı, this is just beyond beautiful.
I can't believe it. You're the best!


1101
00:59:41.143 --> 00:59:43.810
- One more little surprise for the party.
- What?


1102
00:59:45.893 --> 00:59:48.393
[women screaming]

1103
00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:59.810
That must be just how
they talk to each other.


1104
00:59:59.893 --> 01:00:01.726
[all continue screaming]

1105
01:00:07.185 --> 01:00:10.851
[Flamenco music playing]

1106
01:00:21.726 --> 01:00:24.185
You're only here since they insisted,
not to follow me?


1107
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:26.310
Oh, yeah.

1108
01:00:27.143 --> 01:00:27.976
Well, then...

1109
01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.643
- [glasses clinking]
- I guess I'll believe you.


1110
01:00:51.393 --> 01:00:52.810
Big secret to tell you now!

1111
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.060
A minute alone?

1112
01:01:02.393 --> 01:01:03.601
[Cansu laughing]

1113
01:01:04.143 --> 01:01:05.351
Had too much to drink?

1114
01:01:06.226 --> 01:01:07.518
[shushing]

1115
01:01:09.018 --> 01:01:11.060
You know, in a bottle it looks harmless.

1116
01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:14.018
It's in a glass, now buddy. [laughing]

1117
01:01:14.685 --> 01:01:15.601
[woman laughing]

1118
01:01:15.685 --> 01:01:18.560
Your mind is going to get blown
when I tell you what I heard.


1119
01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.143
Aslı, oh, that Aslı...

1120
01:01:22.226 --> 01:01:23.726
Kerem, that guy...

1121
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:27.685
Bro, Aslı is trying to convince you
to go and get married to her soon, man.


1122
01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:30.935
He's trying to change your mind
about the two of you getting married.


1123
01:01:31.018 --> 01:01:32.643
Tuna said so.

1124
01:01:32.726 --> 01:01:34.018
Cansu said so.

1125
01:01:41.643 --> 01:01:44.893
Yeah, I knew. I knew something
bad was going on with him.


1126
01:01:44.976 --> 01:01:47.726
So now I understand her big plan.

1127
01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:50.226
Cansu, you kept our big secret from Tuna?

1128
01:01:53.101 --> 01:01:57.560
It possible at all that you just
told Cansu about all of our plans?


1129
01:01:57.643 --> 01:01:59.018
Just trust me, please!

1130
01:01:59.101 --> 01:02:00.726
Oh, how dare you, Kerem.

1131
01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:01.726
Cansu?

1132
01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:04.310
Hey, please believe me.
I wouldn't do that.


1133
01:02:04.393 --> 01:02:05.810
Well, now I'm furious!

1134
01:02:19.185 --> 01:02:22.310
[Aslı] <i>So, you're really determined
not to marry me, huh, Kerem?</i>


1135
01:02:22.393 --> 01:02:25.435
[Kerem] <i>So, you're really trying
to marry me, huh, Aslı?</i>


1136
01:02:25.518 --> 01:02:27.435
Wedding bells are already ringing.

1137
01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.560
Dream on, girl.

1138
01:02:29.643 --> 01:02:31.268
[tango music playing]

1139
01:02:33.518 --> 01:02:34.518
Come on, then.

1140
01:02:42.935 --> 01:02:44.726
[Aslı] <i>Do you think we can do it?</i>

1141
01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.518
[Kerem] <i>Just follow my lead.</i>

1142
01:02:49.226 --> 01:02:51.185
<i>Men lead in the tango.</i>

1143
01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.810
[crowd applauding]

1144
01:02:57.851 --> 01:03:01.643
Actually, the tango is a dance where every
lady tries to get out and escape men.


1145
01:03:02.226 --> 01:03:03.476
I read that somewhere.

1146
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.643
[crowd whistling and cheering]

1147
01:03:24.226 --> 01:03:26.518
Good thing we're being
honest with each other.


1148
01:03:27.018 --> 01:03:28.601
No more games now. Right?

1149
01:03:30.976 --> 01:03:32.310
[Aslı] You tell me.

1150
01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:42.935
Why would I toy
with you right now, huh?

1151
01:03:45.393 --> 01:03:46.518
If you say so.

1152
01:03:54.226 --> 01:03:55.060
Are you though?

1153
01:03:55.143 --> 01:03:58.351
What purpose is there, baby,
to toy with you anymore, huh?


1154
01:04:00.768 --> 01:04:01.935
[crowd cheering]

1155
01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.685
Sure. So no more games.

1156
01:04:24.101 --> 01:04:26.476
I think that we're perfect for each other.

1157
01:04:29.185 --> 01:04:30.518
Well, we are.

1158
01:04:39.893 --> 01:04:41.685
- [whistle blowing]
- [music ends]


1159
01:04:42.435 --> 01:04:44.060
We just received a complaint.

1160
01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.435
You're so loud, 
Greece can hear you all.

1161
01:04:48.018 --> 01:04:51.101
Uh... we're just having a big party
for our friend's wedding.


1162
01:04:51.185 --> 01:04:52.185
We'll be super quiet.

1163
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.101
Time to party, guys.

1164
01:04:58.685 --> 01:05:00.101
Begin partying!

1165
01:05:00.185 --> 01:05:02.060
[electronic dance music playing]

1166
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.351
[women screaming excitedly]

1167
01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.768
[laughing]

1168
01:05:22.143 --> 01:05:23.601
[women screaming]

1169
01:06:10.851 --> 01:06:13.060
[music fades]

1170
01:06:13.143 --> 01:06:16.060
- [comedic music playing]
- [crickets chirping]


1171
01:06:41.851 --> 01:06:42.851
Morning.

1172
01:06:43.851 --> 01:06:44.976
Oh, is it?

1173
01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.518
Can't be morning.

1174
01:06:46.601 --> 01:06:48.393
Sun's out for a while.

1175
01:06:49.268 --> 01:06:50.268
All right, hurry.

1176
01:06:52.268 --> 01:06:54.518
[moans softly] What's the rush?

1177
01:06:55.976 --> 01:06:58.226
This time is really just
the best time for this.


1178
01:07:00.268 --> 01:07:03.310
[chuckles] No way, it's...
Please, no balloons though.


1179
01:07:04.351 --> 01:07:05.185
Surprise, okay?

1180
01:07:05.268 --> 01:07:06.685
[chuckles nervously]

1181
01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:08.518
- Kerem?
- Hm?


1182
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:11.810
All right. I had a lot of fun,
even though I was really scared,


1183
01:07:11.893 --> 01:07:13.268
but let's not overdo it.

1184
01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:15.976
You can't go on balloons
more than once, right?


1185
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:19.643
You have to trust me now, okay?
You might want this beforehand.


1186
01:07:19.726 --> 01:07:21.768
- Hey, Kerem... Kerem.
- Here.


1187
01:07:21.851 --> 01:07:23.018
[whispering] Here.

1188
01:07:23.601 --> 01:07:24.601
[blows]

1189
01:07:25.935 --> 01:07:27.310
- But if it's...
- Hm?


1190
01:07:27.393 --> 01:07:31.351
If it's paragliding, or bungee jumping,
just find someone else to do that.


1191
01:07:31.435 --> 01:07:32.726
I can't come.

1192
01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:34.726
That's right,
I am saying permanently dead.


1193
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:36.893
I will be gone!
I won't make it. I'll be scared.


1194
01:07:37.726 --> 01:07:39.143
Just relax. It'll be great.

1195
01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:44.768
[groans] Not again!

1196
01:07:44.851 --> 01:07:46.351
[calming music playing]

1197
01:07:55.185 --> 01:07:57.810
Watch your step. 
Little step down.

1198
01:07:57.893 --> 01:07:59.768
- There we go.
- [gasping softly]


1199
01:07:59.851 --> 01:08:00.893
Just wait right here.

1200
01:08:00.976 --> 01:08:02.851
- Wait here?
- Here.


1201
01:08:09.143 --> 01:08:11.393
[calming music warps and ends]

1202
01:08:12.435 --> 01:08:14.893
Did you really think
I would take you bungee jumping


1203
01:08:14.976 --> 01:08:16.518
or take you out paragliding? No.

You're lucky I didn't swallow
about a million of those pills.

I need people to operate the plane.

01:16:25.185 --> 01:16:27.143
Here it comes. Ready?

1357
01:16:32.768 --> 01:16:34.643
I think that it's time
for Aslı to marry me.


1358
01:16:36.351 --> 01:16:37.351
[Emir laughing]

1359
01:16:38.476 --> 01:16:41.768
[Aslı] <i>If I accept this offer, will I
have to live in Dubai for six months?</i>


1360
01:16:41.851 --> 01:16:42.851
[Bulut] <i>Yes.</i>

1361
01:16:45.018 --> 01:16:47.060
Aslı, I know it's a lot.

1362
01:16:47.143 --> 01:16:48.185
It's a big decision.

1363
01:16:48.268 --> 01:16:51.060
But it could be a really big opportunity.

1364
01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:54.726
I really want you to think about it.

1365
01:17:01.643 --> 01:17:02.810
[Bulut sighs]

1366
01:17:02.893 --> 01:17:04.476
[melancholy music continues]

1367
01:17:05.601 --> 01:17:06.810
I'm sure you're...

1368
01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.310
worried Kerem won't like it,

1369
01:17:11.351 --> 01:17:13.351
<i>because the Aslı I know</i>

1370
01:17:14.185 --> 01:17:16.393
<i>would never pass on this opportunity.</i>

1371
01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:24.143
[Cansu] Last one.

1372
01:17:25.185 --> 01:17:26.976
Oh, look at all this stuff!

1373
01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.310
The guy who got it
is just husband material.


1374
01:17:29.393 --> 01:17:31.768
Oh, Kerem. Oh, if only you were single...

1375
01:17:33.268 --> 01:17:35.476
- Oh, wait you are. Ah!
- [book banging]


1376
01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.560
[smacking]

1377
01:17:37.976 --> 01:17:39.268
- [Tuna] Babe...
- [Cansu] Hm?


1378
01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:42.101
I can't wait to live with
the love of my life in one week.


1379
01:17:42.185 --> 01:17:44.435
Me too. It's so exciting, babe.

1380
01:17:44.518 --> 01:17:46.976
- Yeah! Well, I'm more excited.
- No, I'm more excited.


1381
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.185
- No, I'm more excited!
- No, I am.


1382
01:17:49.893 --> 01:17:51.851
- All the unspeakable things...
- [gasping]


1383
01:17:51.935 --> 01:17:54.268
- [Cansu giggling softly]
- Whoa, whoa.


1384
01:17:55.476 --> 01:17:58.393
What's the issue? 
She's my wife, hm?

1385
01:18:03.435 --> 01:18:06.351
[Cansu] Babe, should we check out
the other rooms now?


1386
01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.185
Hey baby, not before the big day!

1387
01:18:10.476 --> 01:18:11.476
Ah.

1388
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.435
We're... Other rooms must be examined,
you know. Check 'em out.


1389
01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.976
[whispering] I said that to trick them.

1390
01:18:18.685 --> 01:18:19.768
- Aslı?
- Kerem?


1391
01:18:20.893 --> 01:18:21.935
[chuckles] You go first.

1392
01:18:24.768 --> 01:18:25.976
Say it.

1393
01:18:26.893 --> 01:18:28.935
Bulut made me an offer for work.

1394
01:18:30.018 --> 01:18:32.060
They'll invest in me,
and also invest in the brand


1395
01:18:32.143 --> 01:18:34.643
if I make a new collection
to give their brand too.


1396
01:18:34.726 --> 01:18:36.435
That's amazing, are you happy?

1397
01:18:37.393 --> 01:18:38.685
That's so great!

1398
01:18:38.768 --> 01:18:41.226
I always knew that you
would be really successful.


1399
01:18:41.726 --> 01:18:43.310
It's just beginning for you now.

1400
01:18:43.393 --> 01:18:45.560
But I have to go
to Dubai for six months now.


1401
01:18:45.643 --> 01:18:47.643
[melancholy music playing]

1402
01:18:52.726 --> 01:18:53.726
For six months?

1403
01:19:14.268 --> 01:19:16.518
[melancholy music continues]

1404
01:20:09.435 --> 01:20:11.435
[music fades out]

1405
01:20:13.101 --> 01:20:15.435
[plays emotional tune]

1406
01:20:28.018 --> 01:20:30.018
[plays emotional tune]

1407
01:20:37.685 --> 01:20:38.851
[tune becomes hopeful]

1408
01:20:44.018 --> 01:20:46.435
[uplifting music playing]

1409
01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.851
[phone buzzing]

1410
01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:58.976
- Kerem?
- Tonight, meet at my house?


1411
01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:01.560
- Sure, I can come.
<i>- Okay.</i>


1412
01:21:01.643 --> 01:21:02.726
Eight o'clock.

1413
01:21:03.351 --> 01:21:05.768
- I can't wait. See you in a bit.
- Kerem?


1414
01:21:07.518 --> 01:21:09.768
You sound different now. 
What happened?

1415
01:21:10.351 --> 01:21:11.351
Oh.

1416
01:21:13.018 --> 01:21:13.851
I love you.

1417
01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:16.476
[uplifting music rises]

1418
01:21:44.893 --> 01:21:47.351
- [doorbell ringing]
- [music fades]


1419
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:59.518
- Welcome.
- I missed you.


1420
01:22:02.685 --> 01:22:03.685
Here.

1421
01:22:11.976 --> 01:22:14.393
Um, romantic meal for two I see.

1422
01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.560
Maybe.

1423
01:22:17.726 --> 01:22:20.286
- But there's another thing too.
- [romantic piano music playing]


1424
01:22:21.685 --> 01:22:22.685
[exhales sharply]

1425
01:22:33.726 --> 01:22:34.935
You look gorgeous.

1426
01:22:35.935 --> 01:22:38.643
[laughs] Well, thank you so much.

1427
01:22:53.226 --> 01:22:54.226
[inhales]

1428
01:22:56.226 --> 01:22:58.143
Know what I thought about through my day?

1429
01:22:59.393 --> 01:23:00.810
No, what is it?

1430
01:23:02.726 --> 01:23:04.351
The second I fell in love with you.

1431
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.518
Was it when I first saw you?

1432
01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:13.101
Was it the first time that we spoke?
Or was it...


1433
01:23:14.143 --> 01:23:16.783
Was it when I saw the innocent girl
hidden behind and lying beneath


1434
01:23:16.851 --> 01:23:18.435
your big, strong outer appearance?

1435
01:23:20.268 --> 01:23:21.976
Well... Well, babe, what was it?

1436
01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.060
[smacks lips]

1437
01:23:24.143 --> 01:23:25.310
I'm not sure.

1438
01:23:28.101 --> 01:23:31.893
I couldn't find a second that my heart
beat without you for even a moment, Aslı.


1439
01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:34.893
It's like I always have.

1440
01:23:39.268 --> 01:23:40.268
But, um...

1441
01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:46.643
I figured out the moment
I became sure I must be with you.


1442
01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.560
Here.

1443
01:23:53.935 --> 01:23:55.518
The night you played here...

1444
01:24:03.643 --> 01:24:04.643
When...

1445
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:08.935
you played on these keys for the...
For the very first time, I...


1446
01:24:10.643 --> 01:24:12.726
[voice breaking] You made
my heart soar then, Aslı.


1447
01:24:17.226 --> 01:24:18.226
Kerem...

1448
01:24:25.643 --> 01:24:26.643
Aslı.

1449
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:30.018
[shimmering tones]

1450
01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:32.101
[romantic music continues]

1451
01:24:41.851 --> 01:24:43.060
Kerem, stop playing.

1452
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:49.643
Please marry me, Aslı.

1453
01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:01.560
- [voice breaking] I can't.
- [music fades]


1454
01:25:10.726 --> 01:25:12.726
[crickets chirping]

1455
01:25:27.393 --> 01:25:29.351
Thought marrying me was what you wanted.

1456
01:25:32.435 --> 01:25:33.976
And you thought marrying me wasn't.

1457
01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:40.976
Your whole plan here is very obvious now.

1458
01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:45.441
You want me not to take the job offer
so you can just make me stay home.


1459
01:25:46.351 --> 01:25:47.685
- No.
- It is.


1460
01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:49.268
No.

1461
01:25:49.685 --> 01:25:52.485
My timing isn't great, but I need
you to believe me that it isn't true.


1462
01:25:52.518 --> 01:25:54.560
You were the one
who made all these grand plans


1463
01:25:54.643 --> 01:25:56.601
so I would hate marriage, weren't you?

1464
01:25:56.685 --> 01:25:58.643
You were. What changed?

1465
01:25:58.726 --> 01:26:01.518
It makes no sense, but please don't
lie to me because I can't take it.


1466
01:26:01.601 --> 01:26:02.726
Will you just...

1467
01:26:03.601 --> 01:26:06.494
What did I say to you when I believed that
that dumb plane was going down?


1468
01:26:06.518 --> 01:26:08.158
That's because you thought we were dying.

1469
01:26:08.185 --> 01:26:10.226
You told me that yourself
after we got down on land.


1470
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:13.768
No, that's not true. That's not what made
me say those things. Come on, please!


1471
01:26:16.101 --> 01:26:19.185
Aslı! Please know I know my heart.

1472
01:26:19.268 --> 01:26:20.851
And I'm sure of myself.

1473
01:26:20.935 --> 01:26:23.185
And this has nothing to do
with the job offer in Dubai,


1474
01:26:23.268 --> 01:26:25.768
or literally anything else,
it is just about you, Aslı.


1475
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.560
But what...

1476
01:26:29.476 --> 01:26:32.226
And all the things that can go
wrong in a marriage, huh?


1477
01:26:34.893 --> 01:26:38.018
It may really just not end up
being happiness forever, but...


1478
01:26:39.185 --> 01:26:42.310
I'll be the best I can be and
I'll make sure to do whatever it takes,


1479
01:26:42.393 --> 01:26:44.768
I promise to make you so happy, Aslı.

1480
01:26:48.518 --> 01:26:51.018
What if we hate each other
in the end after all?


1481
01:26:51.518 --> 01:26:54.161
In court, saying we're bad people,
making awful remarks and threats?


1482
01:26:54.185 --> 01:26:55.435
I'll take my chances.

1483
01:26:57.268 --> 01:26:59.508
A paper won't stop me
from loving you any more than I do.


1484
01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.310
Come on, why do we need to have
a wedding to make our love work?


1485
01:27:02.393 --> 01:27:03.393
You have me already!

1486
01:27:03.476 --> 01:27:05.476
But I don't want
to just have you, all right?


1487
01:27:07.268 --> 01:27:10.143
I want more. To belong to you.
Don't you get that?


1488
01:27:17.351 --> 01:27:19.018
I'm so scared, Kerem.

1489
01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:22.351
[voice cracking] I'm scared too.
Really terrified.


1490
01:27:23.768 --> 01:27:26.268
Isn't that the beautiful
part of this though?


1491
01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:29.560
That we have to just
try to be brave. So brave.


1492
01:27:30.518 --> 01:27:32.726
Even though we're both so scared.

1493
01:27:33.726 --> 01:27:35.435
It's all up to us both.

1494
01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:38.476
Might be a huge old cliché...

1495
01:27:40.893 --> 01:27:43.185
Spending every night
with you is what I want.


1496
01:27:43.685 --> 01:27:45.601
Waking up with you every morning too.

1497
01:27:45.685 --> 01:27:46.685
Me too.

1498
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.560
Aslı?

1499
01:27:58.101 --> 01:27:59.351
Just please marry me now?

1500
01:28:03.185 --> 01:28:04.351
I will.

1501
