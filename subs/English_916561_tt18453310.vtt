1
00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:33.266
My first morning in Bangladesh.

2
00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:38.221
After two days of traveling
and a sleepless night,


3
00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:41.579
I am lying on my hotel
bed feeling dead tired.


4
00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:45.162
The fan gives
me at least some relief.


5
00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:49.965
Lights and shadows fall through
a small gap in the shutter,


6
00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:52.803
displaying the
signs of life of this


7
00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:56.323
foreign world on the
hotel room's ceiling.


8
00:00:57.642 --> 00:01:00.911
While I'm watching
the "movie" on that ceiling,


9
00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:04.460
I remember the movie that
was the trigger for my journey.


10
00:01:05.154 --> 00:01:07.206
That night,
the lights and shadows of this


11
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.737
world were projected
on a screen in Munich:


12
00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:13.311
They were showing
a girl in a documentary,


13
00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:14.681
who paused in the middle of an

14
00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:17.573
interview and asked
her own questions.


15
00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:21.927
Questions that
wouldn't let go of me.


16
00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:25.015
Questions I didn't
know the answers to.


17
00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:27.772
Answers that I myself
would like to know.


18
00:01:28.052 --> 00:01:30.449
I would like to say something.

19
00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:37.402
We women are actually
very unhappy creatures.


20
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:39.840
To survive as a woman...

21
00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:43.196
is actually really hard.

22
00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.752
Why...

23
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:52.187
do we have to live
with so much suffering?


24
00:01:52.347 --> 00:01:54.545
Isn't there any other
way for us women?


25
00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:57.342
Is there a way at all?

26
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.056
Who can answer
this question for me?


27
00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:08.451
I can't get the girl and
her questions out of my mind.


28
00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:11.119
Although our lives
couldn't be more different.


29
00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:13.574
She, a 15-year-old
girl in Bangladesh,


30
00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:15.900
who had been
abducted to a brothel


31
00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:17.514
and was asking
for a way of life,


32
00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:21.140
that was different from
being raped several times a day.


33
00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:23.450
Me...

34
00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:27.129
a documentary film student
from Munich in his early 30s.


35
00:02:27.672 --> 00:02:29.550
Sleepless again from pondering

36
00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:33.299
which one of all the possible
ways of life really made sense.


37
00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.343
Now I feel somehow caught.

38
00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:39.657
Why do I watch pain
and get myself involved,


39
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.097
when I know I can't
do anything about it?


40
00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:44.575
But what am I supposed to do?

41
00:02:45.534 --> 00:02:46.853
Tune it out?

42
00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:48.651
Be indifferent to it?

43
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.689
Should I look for the girl in

44
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.752
Bangladesh and
find out if I can help?


45
00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:54.363
Of course not.

46
00:02:55.644 --> 00:02:57.530
And while I reflect
about this the


47
00:02:57.554 --> 00:03:00.446
next morning,
the doorbell rings.


48
00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.476
This is something
we have as well,


49
00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:04.955
questions about life.

50
00:03:05.194 --> 00:03:07.741
Would it be silly, if one is
aware of being


51
00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:08.911
touched and stuff,

52
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.988
to go there and help?

53
00:03:11.148 --> 00:03:12.787
You can't help.

54
00:03:12.947 --> 00:03:15.384
The only help that
will reach us at the end,


55
00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:17.702
will come through
the kingdom of God.


56
00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:20.899
All conditions on earth
will eventually be changed,


57
00:03:21.058 --> 00:03:23.496
as right now it's not
God who is the ruler.


58
00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:27.892
The Bible says that Satan is the
ruler of this system of things.


59
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:30.729
Someone we humans
can't overcome.


60
00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.635
But the future will bring
change, Jehovah will intervene.


61
00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.162
Through us or by himself?

62
00:03:37.322 --> 00:03:38.841
He himself will intervene

63
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.585
and he will sort out those
who are causing trouble


64
00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:43.796
on this planet.

65
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:52.850
I'm drinking tomato juice.

66
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:55.620
I look out the window.

67
00:03:57.782 --> 00:04:01.378
Cities at night remind
me of grazed knees.


68
00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.069
Two years have passed since
I saw the interview with the


69
00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:09.490
girl and made that unexpected
acquaintance at my door.


70
00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:12.367
In those two years I had many

71
00:04:12.393 --> 00:04:15.364
conversations about
that girl in the movie.


72
00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:17.852
I interviewed
people on the streets,


73
00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:19.494
and friends who
had been involved


74
00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.314
in humanitarian projects.

75
00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:24.454
I talked to male
and female experts,


76
00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.070
like filmmaker Michael Haneke,

77
00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:28.628
to Michaela Rehm,
a professor of ethics,


78
00:04:29.142 --> 00:04:31.660
and to psychoanalyst
Wolfgang Schmidbauer.


79
00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:34.225
How do they all deal with the

80
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.385
images and stories
that reach us?


81
00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:40.246
Do we have a
global responsibility?


82
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.587
Do I have helper syndrome?

83
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.528
My professor asked me,

84
00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:48.182
if I intended to
ride as a white man


85
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.545
on a high horse
into the brothel,


86
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.813
to heroically share my coat.

87
00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:56.851
I learned a lot during
these conversations,


88
00:04:58.022 --> 00:05:02.237
but nevertheless my inner
urge to follow my first impulse,


89
00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:05.114
to find out what
would actually happen


90
00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.391
if I tried to do
something, grew.


91
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.914
Doing nothing for good reason...

92
00:05:11.348 --> 00:05:12.906
I've done that often enough.

93
00:05:14.712 --> 00:05:16.982
Is it possible
to find that girl?


94
00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:20.291
At least I want to try.

95
00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:38.916
The destination of my
journey: Faridpur.


96
00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:42.949
This is where almost seven
years ago filmmaker


97
00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:45.375
Michael Glawogger
made the interview.


98
00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.665
I have this feeling you get
when you jump off a diving board


99
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.991
and there is no going back.

100
00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:00.925
I think about
the girl's questions.


101
00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:03.815
Is there a way?

102
00:06:05.734 --> 00:06:09.291
My way back would take much
longer now than to go ahead.


103
00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:12.969
And despite all doubts
and uncertainties,


104
00:06:14.886 --> 00:06:15.885
that feels right

105
00:06:22.202 --> 00:06:25.896
QUESTIONS

106
00:07:11.148 --> 00:07:12.147
Fantastic.

107
00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:14.225
Very nice.
- But where is she?


108
00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:23.656
She says that you men
are good customers.


109
00:07:23.815 --> 00:07:25.414
Oh, we are good customers?

110
00:07:26.772 --> 00:07:30.808
With your life you
are good customers.


111
00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:32.087
But...

112
00:07:42.597 --> 00:07:45.554
She says, she is very poor.

113
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.787
Poor woman, very poor woman.

114
00:07:56.303 --> 00:07:58.381
I'm not getting any clue.

115
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.256
I'm not completely
sure what she is saying...


116
00:08:04.894 --> 00:08:07.092
She's not talking very clearly.

117
00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:08.930
But where could I find her?

118
00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:11.786
- It is very tough.
- It's very tough?


119
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.984
It is very tough to find out.

120
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:20.718
Do you know anything
about the situation there?


121
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.796
No, actually, no.

122
00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:25.594
I never go there.

123
00:08:25.753 --> 00:08:28.351
But you can check,
the brothel is there.


124
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:30.748
On the bank of this river.
- The city river?


125
00:08:30.908 --> 00:08:32.067
The roof of the building.

126
00:08:32.227 --> 00:08:33.825
This?
- Yes, the white one.


127
00:08:35.184 --> 00:08:36.503
Can you lead us there?

128
00:08:36.662 --> 00:08:37.741
No?

129
00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:43.136
Thank you very much.

130
00:08:49.232 --> 00:08:52.180
With some hesitation
I follow his directions


131
00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:54.345
and wonder whether
I should rather


132
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.919
postpone my first
visit to the brothel,


133
00:08:57.784 --> 00:08:59.959
when suddenly a boy
steps up to me, who


134
00:09:00.562 --> 00:09:02.678
had been following
me for some time.


135
00:09:04.217 --> 00:09:07.334
"Brothel?" he asks shyly.

136
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:09.946
But less than one
minute later he takes


137
00:09:09.971 --> 00:09:11.962
my hand and guides
me through the city,


138
00:09:11.987 --> 00:09:14.105
as if we had known
each other forever.


139
00:09:14.783 --> 00:09:16.222
His name is Redoy.

140
00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:20.139
Which translated to
English means "heart."


141
00:09:36.363 --> 00:09:39.381
After a discussion
about if and whom


142
00:09:39.406 --> 00:09:43.196
I'm allowed to film,
I dare to take the next step.


143
00:09:55.304 --> 00:09:56.902
Do you know her?

144
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.259
No?

145
00:10:07.826 --> 00:10:10.384
I'm not allowed
to film underage girls.


146
00:10:10.923 --> 00:10:13.031
Some of them
have mask-like white


147
00:10:13.056 --> 00:10:16.281
makeup, and glassy
eyes and empty looks,


148
00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:17.807
as if they are on drugs.

149
00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:21.772
And I notice the many
children who are bustling about,


150
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.020
and who have made this
environment


151
00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:25.447
their home as naturally

152
00:10:25.797 --> 00:10:29.511
as kids do with it with every
environment all over the world.


153
00:10:52.327 --> 00:10:54.005
Do you know where she lives?

154
00:10:54.485 --> 00:10:55.923
Where we can find her?

155
00:10:57.482 --> 00:10:58.840
I know where it is.

156
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.439
So you know her?

157
00:11:01.398 --> 00:11:04.195
She used to live there,
I don't know about now.


158
00:11:13.302 --> 00:11:15.151
The camera seems
to give the people


159
00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:17.299
the feeling that I
know what I'm doing


160
00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:22.163
and it protects me from
being perceived as a client.


161
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.928
I immerse myself in this alien
world, that I feel deeply about.


162
00:11:30.968 --> 00:11:33.046
But does it concern me at all?

163
00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:49.005
A group of girls approaches me.

164
00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:54.714
Their Madam, that's to
say their procurer, their owner,


165
00:11:55.394 --> 00:11:57.397
had once told them
about a film shooting.


166
00:11:57.937 --> 00:12:00.679
And indeed: I
recognise the woman


167
00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:02.252
from Michael Glawogger's movie.

168
00:12:02.696 --> 00:12:04.814
When I was the spokeswoman here,

169
00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:07.292
someone introduced me to Michael

170
00:12:07.611 --> 00:12:10.808
and he accompanied
me everywhere.


171
00:12:10.968 --> 00:12:13.126
He also took a picture of me.

172
00:12:14.205 --> 00:12:15.923
So, does she know this girl?

173
00:12:16.882 --> 00:12:22.277
Why do we have to live
with so much suffering?


174
00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:24.754
Isn't there any other
way for us women?


175
00:12:25.433 --> 00:12:26.872
No, I don't know her.

176
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.388
She looks a bit like Shumi.

177
00:12:36.822 --> 00:12:38.261
She doesn't know her?
- No.


178
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.179
She was not her Madam?
- No.


179
00:12:40.339 --> 00:12:43.935
At the end of the interview
the girl asks some questions.


180
00:12:44.095 --> 00:12:47.731
Do you have answers
to these questions?


181
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:51.807
We don't have a real chance.

182
00:12:52.327 --> 00:12:55.204
And there is no chance
to find another job either.


183
00:12:55.364 --> 00:12:57.002
But each one of us

184
00:12:57.162 --> 00:13:01.238
would love to get out of
here and see the world.


185
00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.576
The journey to the other side of

186
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:10.594
the screen was so
unexpectedly fast.


187
00:13:11.587 --> 00:13:13.319
I'm surprised by the hospitality

188
00:13:13.344 --> 00:13:15.711
and the honesty
of the people here.


189
00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:18.939
They invite me for
tea everywhere and the


190
00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:21.789
women tell me frankly
why they are here.


191
00:13:22.521 --> 00:13:25.958
Many of them because they
are forced to work for a Madam.


192
00:13:26.532 --> 00:13:29.357
Others used to be forced,
but then they


193
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:32.207
couldn't find a way
back into society


194
00:13:32.232 --> 00:13:34.070
as they were
considered dishonored.


195
00:13:35.443 --> 00:13:38.281
When they get too old
to earn money, they buy


196
00:13:38.316 --> 00:13:42.157
young girls in return and force
them to work for them.


197
00:13:42.317 --> 00:13:45.833
A vicious circle...
since colonial times.


198
00:14:27.152 --> 00:14:31.667
Nobody that I talked to
knew anything about the girl.


199
00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:47.074
On my way back to the hotel I
run into my first acquaintance.


200
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:51.687
Redoy, the boy who had guided me
to the brothel.


201
00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:55.533
He tells me that he lives
in the brothel with his sister.


202
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.660
At night he prefers
roaming the streets.


203
00:14:59.347 --> 00:15:01.233
His sleeping place
is under the bed


204
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:03.827
where his sister
serves her clients.


205
00:15:05.873 --> 00:15:10.508
My stepmother, she often used
to beat me up.


206
00:15:10.668 --> 00:15:13.425
One morning at three o'clock,

207
00:15:13.585 --> 00:15:15.263
my sister and I ran off.

208
00:15:15.423 --> 00:15:19.499
We slept in Dhaka station...

209
00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:21.817
Please, slow down.

210
00:15:22.177 --> 00:15:23.695
How long did you stay there?

211
00:15:23.855 --> 00:15:26.053
We stayed there
ten days without food.


212
00:15:26.213 --> 00:15:28.370
I prayed to Allah.

213
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.927
"Oh, Allah, please send
someone who can change my life."


214
00:15:32.087 --> 00:15:35.523
And a woman came
and took us to Faridpur.


215
00:15:35.763 --> 00:15:40.278
But she sold us for 1300 Euros.

216
00:15:40.478 --> 00:15:43.275
Then my sister got sold again.

217
00:15:43.435 --> 00:15:47.551
It's so bad here that we are
wondering about how to escape.


218
00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:54.624
I've never been
without my sister


219
00:15:54.784 --> 00:15:57.501
and I couldn't live without her.

220
00:17:05.193 --> 00:17:08.270
I got no indication
where to find the girl,


221
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.925
but two names were
mentioned to me in the


222
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:14.793
brothel again and again:
Chanchala and Shyamal.


223
00:17:16.043 --> 00:17:18.155
I made some
research and found out


224
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.707
that they were among
the first ones to speak


225
00:17:20.803 --> 00:17:23.341
up for the rights of sex
workers in Bangladesh


226
00:17:23.704 --> 00:17:26.805
and that they fight
against forced prostitution.


227
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:29.288
Meanwhile they also run a home

228
00:17:29.312 --> 00:17:31.487
for little girls
from the brothel.


229
00:17:32.003 --> 00:17:33.340
Shyamal speaks English.

230
00:17:33.923 --> 00:17:35.778
During our phone
call he invites me


231
00:17:35.802 --> 00:17:37.656
straight away to
come to his home.


232
00:17:45.233 --> 00:17:47.941
So yesterday,
when I was in the brothel,


233
00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:50.388
I got to know so many people

234
00:17:50.413 --> 00:17:53.473
and heard about their
abuse and suffering.


235
00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:57.141
And I asked myself,
"What can one do?"


236
00:17:57.301 --> 00:17:59.779
You know,
you cannot help the whole world.


237
00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:01.097
What do you think?

238
00:18:01.257 --> 00:18:02.816
Yeah, it's true.

239
00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:05.533
But somebody has to start.

240
00:18:06.812 --> 00:18:09.569
I'm optimistic,
always optimistic.


241
00:18:09.594 --> 00:18:12.126
Because when I started
this organization,


242
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:15.203
we had a broken
chair and a broken table.


243
00:18:15.363 --> 00:18:17.002
And now it is big enough.

244
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:19.159
In my sense it is big enough.

245
00:18:19.319 --> 00:18:22.636
We had a small start.

246
00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:26.672
We see that the start is small,
we like to be small,


247
00:18:26.832 --> 00:18:30.788
but we want to
make it beautiful.


248
00:18:32.491 --> 00:18:34.424
Through his studies in Japan

249
00:18:34.584 --> 00:18:37.317
Shyamal got in contact
with aid agencies for


250
00:18:37.341 --> 00:18:40.458
women who had become
victims of sexual violence.


251
00:18:40.883 --> 00:18:42.539
That made him
perceive things in his


252
00:18:42.564 --> 00:18:44.774
home country
with different eyes.


253
00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:47.707
With his wife Chanchala
he founded a non-profit


254
00:18:47.732 --> 00:18:51.767
organization that they called
Shapla Mohila, "Lily-woman."


255
00:18:52.728 --> 00:18:56.202
Shyamal invites me
to the office to meet Chanchala.


256
00:18:56.722 --> 00:18:59.919
Our social
situation is like this:


257
00:19:00.078 --> 00:19:02.436
Since our country
is a Muslim country,


258
00:19:02.596 --> 00:19:05.553
it's already a sin

259
00:19:05.713 --> 00:19:08.910
to pronounce the
words "sex worker."


260
00:19:09.069 --> 00:19:12.344
It's also a sin to get
closer than twelve meters


261
00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:13.545
to a sex worker.

262
00:19:13.705 --> 00:19:15.223
All this is a sin.

263
00:19:15.383 --> 00:19:17.941
"Keep as much distance
as possible from them,"


264
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.979
that's what I thought back then.

265
00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:22.656
When I started this work,

266
00:19:22.816 --> 00:19:25.533
I knew many rumors
from the brothel,


267
00:19:25.693 --> 00:19:27.131
as I grew up close to it.

268
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:29.340
To see it with my own
eyes made me so sad


269
00:19:29.365 --> 00:19:31.641
that I wanted to
rescue these girls.


270
00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:43.515
So they told you to lie,
didn't they?


271
00:19:44.154 --> 00:19:46.912
They said they would tell me

272
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:49.988
what I should say
regarding my age.


273
00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:52.426
I told them that I was 15.

274
00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:57.581
But they said that I had
to tell people I was 20.


275
00:19:57.821 --> 00:20:01.457
I stayed calm and thought about

276
00:20:01.697 --> 00:20:03.255
how I could run away.

277
00:20:03.415 --> 00:20:06.852
Yesterday I tried,
but I didn't make it.


278
00:20:07.366 --> 00:20:09.813
Chanchala and Shyamal
probably know hundreds


279
00:20:09.838 --> 00:20:12.064
of cases like the girl
from the documentary.


280
00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:14.931
I feel almost embarrassed
to tell them that I came


281
00:20:14.955 --> 00:20:17.904
all the way because of
the questions of one girl.


282
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.718
Do you think it's somehow unjust

283
00:20:20.878 --> 00:20:24.953
to help one girl
because she had the luck


284
00:20:25.113 --> 00:20:26.312
to be in that movie?

285
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:30.828
Yes, it's not unjust, I'd say...

286
00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:35.783
but a single person
you can help,


287
00:20:35.942 --> 00:20:38.620
but it is better to
change the system.


288
00:20:39.299 --> 00:20:41.777
Because it is a
continuous process,


289
00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:43.815
one girl will come,
another girl will come,


290
00:20:43.974 --> 00:20:45.693
then another will escape...

291
00:20:45.853 --> 00:20:48.010
It's not going to stop.

292
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.127
So we need to think
about the system,


293
00:20:51.287 --> 00:20:53.525
we need to change the system.

294
00:20:54.898 --> 00:20:56.497
Of course Shyamal is right.

295
00:20:57.094 --> 00:20:58.769
But that I should be
able to change the


296
00:20:58.794 --> 00:21:01.019
system
seems a bit unrealistic to me.


297
00:21:02.024 --> 00:21:04.834
Maybe I should just
stick to my search for now.


298
00:21:05.433 --> 00:21:07.831
Do you think it's
possible to find that girl?


299
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.108
It's a time thing.

300
00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:11.427
So in the short time

301
00:21:11.587 --> 00:21:13.345
it's not possible to find her.

302
00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:18.899
Maybe it will take one or two
or even three, five years.


303
00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:22.491
Shyamal tells me that
he and his wife often


304
00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:26.452
run into opposition, because
they support dishonored women.


305
00:21:26.956 --> 00:21:28.611
And that he is pleased
to meet someone


306
00:21:28.636 --> 00:21:30.558
who isn't indifferent
to these fates.


307
00:21:31.262 --> 00:21:32.894
He wants to help me in my search

308
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.096
and accompanies
me to the brothel.


309
00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:55.103
Can we find her here?

310
00:22:00.418 --> 00:22:03.135
What does she think?
Is there a way out?


311
00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:07.131
He wants to know

312
00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:12.006
if there is a way to
get out of this place?


313
00:22:35.143 --> 00:22:36.821
Every time I have a client,

314
00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:39.139
I need to wake up my
son and send him out.


315
00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:41.017
That hurts me.

316
00:22:41.177 --> 00:22:43.854
We all have the same problem,
all the time.


317
00:22:44.014 --> 00:22:47.331
Having to shake the kids out
of sleep and then have sex.


318
00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.608
I want to go to school.
- He wants to go to school.


319
00:22:51.527 --> 00:22:52.965
Our life is almost over.

320
00:22:53.125 --> 00:22:55.523
But we want a
different life for our kids.


321
00:22:55.763 --> 00:22:58.160
We need a home for the boys,

322
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.518
like there is one
for the little girls.


323
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:03.627
You know, I can't build a
children's home, you know.


324
00:23:03.794 --> 00:23:04.833
Yes.

325
00:23:08.072 --> 00:23:11.707
This mother is not the only
one who asks me to do that.


326
00:23:12.456 --> 00:23:15.790
My pale skin seems to
promise unlimited resources.


327
00:23:16.106 --> 00:23:18.435
And of course it would
make sense to build a home.


328
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:21.295
Kids who live in
a brothel usually


329
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.923
don't get accepted
by the schools,


330
00:23:22.948 --> 00:23:26.864
as other parents would take
their kids out of the classes.


331
00:23:28.275 --> 00:23:30.718
And without education,
they will very


332
00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:33.395
likely spend their
whole lives in a brothel.


333
00:23:39.249 --> 00:23:42.563
I ask Shyamal how the girls
get into forced prostitution.


334
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.935
And he offers to
introduce me to someone


335
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.568
who worked as a
human trafficker.


336
00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:49.592
Shyamal says that
they don't need to hide


337
00:23:49.617 --> 00:23:53.687
themselves too much, as the
police often cash in as well.


338
00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:57.066
And in fact,
less than one hour later,


339
00:23:57.555 --> 00:23:59.818
I find myself sitting
in front of him.


340
00:24:00.098 --> 00:24:03.695
My job is to stroll
around the city square.


341
00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:08.330
Sometimes I find poor
and lost girls there.


342
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:10.807
They are very hungry.

343
00:24:11.407 --> 00:24:14.284
First I give them hope.

344
00:24:14.803 --> 00:24:20.278
I say, "Come with me,
you can work as a housemaid."


345
00:24:21.637 --> 00:24:25.033
Then they accept.

346
00:24:25.193 --> 00:24:28.989
But I have a different plan.

347
00:24:30.428 --> 00:24:31.986
I'm going to sell them.

348
00:24:32.266 --> 00:24:34.783
They say,
"I don't do this kind of job."


349
00:24:34.943 --> 00:24:36.781
Then I use torture.

350
00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:40.217
After torturing a girl,
I bring her to a house where


351
00:24:40.241 --> 00:24:41.776
I continue the torture.

352
00:24:41.936 --> 00:24:44.534
If I threaten to continue,
they accept.


353
00:24:46.532 --> 00:24:49.888
First I give her sleeping
pills and when she is asleep,


354
00:24:50.048 --> 00:24:53.165
I wake her up in the
middle of the night.


355
00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.955
Together with three or four
friends we


356
00:24:55.979 --> 00:24:57.680
completely undress her.

357
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.518
We tell her, "If you
don't do it, we kill you."


358
00:25:04.194 --> 00:25:08.869
Do you also sexually
abuse the girls?


359
00:25:09.828 --> 00:25:13.137
Yes, and we take pictures
and threaten to show them


360
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:14.344
to their families

361
00:25:14.504 --> 00:25:16.781
if they don't cooperate.

362
00:25:16.941 --> 00:25:18.819
I need the money.

363
00:25:18.979 --> 00:25:21.497
These girls are not my family,

364
00:25:21.656 --> 00:25:24.407
I don't care if they're
suffering, I picked them


365
00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:25.652
up from the streets.

366
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.568
If somebody did
this to your daughter,


367
00:25:30.807 --> 00:25:32.006
what would you do?

368
00:25:32.166 --> 00:25:33.644
I would kill him.

369
00:25:34.843 --> 00:25:36.242
I would shoot him dead.

370
00:25:36.271 --> 00:25:39.058
- He would have killed that...
- Really?


371
00:25:41.756 --> 00:25:43.115
Really?

372
00:25:44.554 --> 00:25:45.593
Yes.

373
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:11.233
Shyamal gets a phone call and we
drive straight to the brothel.


374
00:26:11.929 --> 00:26:14.894
A young woman called
Hafeza sought refuge


375
00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:16.957
with someone of
his aid organization.


376
00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:21.237
Sonya rescued her,
I wasn't there.


377
00:26:21.397 --> 00:26:23.475
Now tell us, we are here.

378
00:26:23.634 --> 00:26:27.511
There was blood
everywhere in her room.


379
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:31.347
Here, she hit her with this one.

380
00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:34.783
She could have died.

381
00:26:34.943 --> 00:26:35.942
Oh my God.

382
00:26:42.216 --> 00:26:44.494
How do you know
that she was beaten?


383
00:26:44.653 --> 00:26:45.892
Look at her face.

384
00:26:47.171 --> 00:26:48.450
She hit her terribly.

385
00:26:50.488 --> 00:26:52.925
Where are you from? Dinajpur?

386
00:26:55.483 --> 00:26:58.639
And how did you get here?

387
00:27:00.597 --> 00:27:03.634
OK, you don't need to talk.

388
00:27:05.366 --> 00:27:08.410
Hafeza has been in the
brothel for only ten days.


389
00:27:09.215 --> 00:27:11.255
Ever since her Madam
had tried to break


390
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.014
her resistance
without any success.


391
00:27:14.863 --> 00:27:17.087
Hafeza let every client feel

392
00:27:17.486 --> 00:27:19.818
that she wasn't
there voluntarily.


393
00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:23.135
But she can't
stay in the brothel.


394
00:27:23.574 --> 00:27:25.652
So maybe we can
rent a hotel room,


395
00:27:25.812 --> 00:27:28.370
so she can get some rest
until we know what we can do?


396
00:27:28.529 --> 00:27:30.408
A hotel is not safe for her.

397
00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:33.524
You mean it's not safe,
someone could try to harm her?


398
00:27:33.684 --> 00:27:37.800
Maybe it's a problem, yes.
- Someone will come?


399
00:27:40.517 --> 00:27:43.075
Don't tell me she is underage.

400
00:27:44.593 --> 00:27:45.952
If she gets out...

401
00:27:46.112 --> 00:27:48.470
we'll get in trouble
with the police.


402
00:27:49.429 --> 00:27:51.530
In the middle of this chaos,

403
00:27:51.542 --> 00:27:54.870
Redoy,
who wants to play cricket.


404
00:28:03.486 --> 00:28:05.907
Nobody wants to call the police.

405
00:28:05.931 --> 00:28:08.470
They would probably only
take what money they could.


406
00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:11.009
Shyamal takes a
big risk by liberating


407
00:28:11.034 --> 00:28:13.286
Hafeza from the
brothel all by himself.


408
00:28:13.842 --> 00:28:16.108
It's difficult enough
with underage girls and


409
00:28:16.133 --> 00:28:19.068
almost impossible
when a woman is over 18.


410
00:28:22.036 --> 00:28:24.394
Her fingers are
swollen from the beats.


411
00:28:26.466 --> 00:28:28.476
Hafeza's Madam had been cautious

412
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:30.586
to leave as few
marks as possible,


413
00:28:30.915 --> 00:28:33.477
by hitting her mainly on
the joints and in the stomach.


414
00:28:34.413 --> 00:28:38.209
Visibly mistreated
girls get fewer clients.


415
00:29:18.199 --> 00:29:20.324
When I say goodbye to Hafeza,

416
00:29:20.589 --> 00:29:21.875
she takes my hand,

417
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.447
and suddenly a cold
shiver runs through me.


418
00:29:27.693 --> 00:29:29.675
I realize that in a way the

419
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.892
camera is also a
protection for me


420
00:29:32.812 --> 00:29:35.689
behind which I've been
hiding to some extent.


421
00:30:10.288 --> 00:30:12.166
THIS POST IS VERY
IMPORTANT TO ME


422
00:30:12.326 --> 00:30:13.325
PLEASE READ IT

423
00:30:13.484 --> 00:30:15.283
IT'S A PERSONAL
REQUEST FOR A DONATION


424
00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:18.369
I would like to
somehow help Hafeza.


425
00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:20.380
And also the
kids in the brothel.


426
00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:23.260
The only thing
I can come up with


427
00:30:23.638 --> 00:30:25.319
is to make a post on Facebook

428
00:30:25.344 --> 00:30:27.447
where I ask friends
for donations.


429
00:30:30.525 --> 00:30:33.442
Redoy is waiting for
me in front of the hotel.


430
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.137
He realizes that I'm a bit sad

431
00:30:36.921 --> 00:30:40.324
and to my surprise he
proposes a solution.


432
00:30:40.817 --> 00:30:43.015
Michael is very sad.

433
00:30:43.694 --> 00:30:46.531
I can see that he's very sad.

434
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:49.129
I will help him to get married.

435
00:30:49.368 --> 00:30:53.844
Is it possible to live
and not be married?


436
00:30:54.004 --> 00:30:57.720
You are married, aren't you?
You should get married too.


437
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.318
I'll get you married.

438
00:30:59.478 --> 00:31:03.474
He said that he
wants to give you a girl.


439
00:31:03.714 --> 00:31:06.751
You have a girl in
your mind already?


440
00:31:08.429 --> 00:31:12.385
She's beautiful and
as white as Michael.


441
00:31:12.545 --> 00:31:15.942
She lives with us
and her name is Tasli.


442
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:19.418
Why did you choose Tasli?

443
00:31:19.578 --> 00:31:20.697
She is so pretty.

444
00:31:21.936 --> 00:31:23.123
Pretty. Nothing else?

445
00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:25.133
Her skin is as
fair as Michael's.


446
00:31:25.292 --> 00:31:27.490
And her hair is
beautiful and blonde


447
00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.089
like Michael's hair.

448
00:31:29.568 --> 00:31:32.485
Her hair is pretty and white,
but what about her heart?


449
00:31:32.645 --> 00:31:33.724
Yes.

450
00:31:33.964 --> 00:31:37.760
And if you slap her twice,
she'll agree to marry him.


451
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.878
Slap her?
- Yes, but only twice.


452
00:31:40.877 --> 00:31:43.502
We need to go to the
hospital. Shyamal is


453
00:31:43.514 --> 00:31:46.591
afraid that Hafeza might
have internal bleeding.


454
00:31:55.575 --> 00:31:57.517
Chanchala has the idea

455
00:31:58.032 --> 00:32:00.366
that I, the white man
with the camera,


456
00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:02.735
could interview the
residence doctor.


457
00:32:03.474 --> 00:32:05.193
Maybe he would
feel flattered and


458
00:32:05.217 --> 00:32:07.930
find a way to treat
Hafeza for free.


459
00:32:10.847 --> 00:32:12.485
I'm a member of this hospital

460
00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:16.122
and pediatrician
of this hospital.


461
00:32:16.281 --> 00:32:21.117
And coordinator of
One Stop Crisis Center,


462
00:32:21.748 --> 00:32:26.223
a project from the government
to help these victims.


463
00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:31.796
The strategy, that doesn't
really make me feel comfortable,


464
00:32:32.046 --> 00:32:36.741
works out and it repeatedly
opens doors for us from now on.


465
00:32:37.578 --> 00:32:40.033
The residence doctor
personally takes


466
00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:42.128
care of Hafeza's
hospital admission.


467
00:32:42.415 --> 00:32:46.691
Somebody hit you.

468
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:49.448
What happened exactly?

469
00:32:49.608 --> 00:32:52.565
What was the reason?

470
00:32:52.725 --> 00:32:54.283
Nothing special.

471
00:32:54.443 --> 00:32:56.241
That's how it is, she hits me.

472
00:32:56.401 --> 00:32:58.279
But tell me, why?

473
00:32:58.439 --> 00:33:01.077
What she demands,

474
00:33:01.236 --> 00:33:02.915
what she asks me to do for her.

475
00:33:03.075 --> 00:33:05.432
I don't have a clue
what it is all about.


476
00:33:05.592 --> 00:33:08.509
So that's why she hits me.

477
00:33:10.427 --> 00:33:12.265
We should do something.

478
00:33:15.582 --> 00:33:17.260
Sir, we should do something.

479
00:33:22.215 --> 00:33:25.732
Where did she hit you?
- All over the body.


480
00:33:26.132 --> 00:33:27.210
What do you think?

481
00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.848
Do you want to report
your Madam to the police?


482
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:33.444
She should be suffering as much

483
00:33:33.604 --> 00:33:34.883
as she made me suffer.

484
00:33:35.043 --> 00:33:38.759
Then we have to report her.

485
00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:42.595
You can do it,
or your parents can do it.


486
00:33:47.956 --> 00:33:50.864
Hafeza will stay at
the hospital for observation.


487
00:33:51.624 --> 00:33:53.063
Shyamal has to leave.

488
00:33:53.543 --> 00:33:55.791
He needs to drive
the girl that sat in his


489
00:33:55.816 --> 00:33:58.255
office, when I met him
and Chanchala yesterday,


490
00:33:58.437 --> 00:33:59.535
to the government home.

491
00:34:00.718 --> 00:34:03.177
The 15-year-old Padma
had been in the brothel


492
00:34:03.202 --> 00:34:05.406
for just two days,
before she was freed.


493
00:34:05.825 --> 00:34:07.263
She was very lucky.

494
00:34:07.854 --> 00:34:11.890
But the government home
was not how I expected it to be.


495
00:34:20.975 --> 00:34:23.993
The liberated
girls just get locked away,


496
00:34:24.774 --> 00:34:26.601
although they are the victims.

497
00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:30.375
The authorities just
don't know where to put them.


498
00:34:31.025 --> 00:34:33.346
Their families often
refuse to take them back.


499
00:34:33.883 --> 00:34:35.782
And a young woman
who is not connected to a


500
00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:39.113
family has almost no
chance in this society.


501
00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:44.288
I ask Shyamal if it was
a good idea to take Padma here.


502
00:34:44.853 --> 00:34:48.444
His answer: It might
not be an ideal place,


503
00:34:48.994 --> 00:34:51.291
but in the brothel
they are also locked in.


504
00:34:52.158 --> 00:34:54.740
At least here
they don't get violated.


505
00:35:03.354 --> 00:35:05.272
The girls are so locked away.

506
00:35:05.912 --> 00:35:08.909
Why is that? Would they run
away if they had the chance to?


507
00:35:08.968 --> 00:35:11.226
Yes.
- They would run away?


508
00:35:11.386 --> 00:35:12.425
You are right.

509
00:35:12.585 --> 00:35:18.020
We don't like to define it as a…

510
00:35:22.095 --> 00:35:23.734
Victim support center?

511
00:35:24.613 --> 00:35:26.131
Prison?
- Yes.


512
00:35:26.275 --> 00:35:29.552
We don't want to speak that
this a prison cell.


513
00:35:30.407 --> 00:35:34.163
So we call it in a different
name, "safe home."


514
00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:46.791
She tell me the story
how she came here?


515
00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.947
How did you end
up as a prostitute?


516
00:35:52.505 --> 00:35:55.102
Why I left home?

517
00:35:55.262 --> 00:35:59.738
Back then I had a fight
at home with my husband.


518
00:35:59.898 --> 00:36:03.814
Then I left home
and went to Bhoirab.


519
00:36:04.053 --> 00:36:05.572
I met a woman there,

520
00:36:05.732 --> 00:36:07.650
she promised me a good job.

521
00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:11.686
But then she brought me
to a brothel and sold me.


522
00:36:13.484 --> 00:36:14.883
I tried to run away,

523
00:36:15.042 --> 00:36:18.079
but I did not make it.

524
00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:20.597
They caught me again.

525
00:36:21.116 --> 00:36:22.795
I was there for one year,

526
00:36:22.955 --> 00:36:26.031
then I was rescued

527
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:28.269
and they brought
me to this place.


528
00:36:29.028 --> 00:36:32.065
When I came to this home,
I was pregnant.


529
00:36:32.225 --> 00:36:35.422
They brought me to the hospital
and there I had my baby.


530
00:36:35.582 --> 00:36:38.339
Since then we have lived here.

531
00:36:38.499 --> 00:36:42.095
I want to leave as soon as
I have learned something.


532
00:36:42.255 --> 00:36:44.853
I'd like to be able
to learn a job,


533
00:36:45.012 --> 00:36:47.370
to learn a profession.

534
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.408
Until then, I can't go back.

535
00:36:53.284 --> 00:36:55.402
Back then I was very young.

536
00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:00.077
My aunt lived in Dhaka

537
00:37:00.237 --> 00:37:04.033
and I wasn't grown up yet.

538
00:37:04.793 --> 00:37:07.630
When my aunt was at work,

539
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.347
I went outside to look for her.

540
00:37:10.507 --> 00:37:13.864
A woman approached me, saying,

541
00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:17.260
"Your aunt is at my place."

542
00:37:19.858 --> 00:37:21.496
I asked her

543
00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:25.812
if it was true what she
was saying or a lie?


544
00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.889
I followed her

545
00:37:29.048 --> 00:37:31.326
and saw that my
aunt wasn't there.


546
00:37:31.646 --> 00:37:35.162
Somebody put a white
tissue over my face.


547
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.878
After that I don't
recall anything.


548
00:37:45.908 --> 00:37:47.830
Monica can only
leave the government


549
00:37:47.855 --> 00:37:49.448
home With her
parents' agreement.


550
00:37:50.307 --> 00:37:52.610
But the home management
can't get hold of them yet.


551
00:37:52.635 --> 00:37:54.528
They seem to have
left their hometown.


552
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.583
Now Monica is locked in here -

553
00:37:58.161 --> 00:37:59.586
for an indefinite time -

554
00:38:00.262 --> 00:38:02.733
together with 30 other girls
and young women.


555
00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.750
Upon our departure,
Monica asks us to look for


556
00:38:39.775 --> 00:38:43.421
her family and we
promise her that we'll try.


557
00:38:44.533 --> 00:38:46.691
So they're not in
their hometown?


558
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:48.609
What do we do now?

559
00:38:50.287 --> 00:38:52.325
I'm looking through
the districts


560
00:38:52.485 --> 00:38:54.483
and then from sub-districts...

561
00:39:00.346 --> 00:39:02.510
Shyamal spends
the afternoon calling


562
00:39:02.535 --> 00:39:05.046
post offices and
village administrations,


563
00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:08.330
until we suddenly
get an unexpected


564
00:39:08.355 --> 00:39:10.147
and very colorful visit.

565
00:39:14.463 --> 00:39:16.649
The kids urge me
to come outside with


566
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:18.595
them to smear each
other with color.


567
00:39:19.545 --> 00:39:21.503
After visiting the
government home,


568
00:39:21.951 --> 00:39:23.454
I'm not in the mood at all.

569
00:39:24.118 --> 00:39:25.775
But the kids tell me
that it's part of the


570
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.716
Holi festival and if
I refused to come,


571
00:39:27.741 --> 00:39:29.162
I would offend the gods.

572
00:39:30.166 --> 00:39:32.909
I know that most of
the kids are not even Hindus,


573
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:37.120
but I realize that they
won't take no for an answer.


574
00:39:37.997 --> 00:39:41.008
And maybe some
color will do me good.


575
00:40:56.521 --> 00:40:57.520
Police.

576
00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:01.436
Normally I'm
afraid of the police.


577
00:41:01.596 --> 00:41:04.233
Can you ask Redoy if
police are good people?


578
00:41:04.393 --> 00:41:05.911
Are the police nice?

579
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:07.789
No. The police are bad here.

580
00:41:12.353 --> 00:41:13.592
Why not?

581
00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:19.338
Police agents who don't
like the drug dealers are good.


582
00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:22.055
Those who support
drug dealers are not good.


583
00:41:22.215 --> 00:41:25.731
If somebody arrested the police,
I would be very happy.


584
00:41:27.929 --> 00:41:31.566
I would thank Michael
if he arrested the police.


585
00:41:34.662 --> 00:41:36.072
I'm so happy that the kids

586
00:41:36.084 --> 00:41:38.599
convinced me not
to offend the gods.


587
00:41:39.158 --> 00:41:40.665
The color did me good.

588
00:41:42.269 --> 00:41:45.146
How could all
this happen in just one day?


589
00:41:45.645 --> 00:41:47.530
The kids and
bathing in the river,


590
00:41:48.598 --> 00:41:52.010
Bringing Padma to
the so-called "safe home."


591
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.848
Hafeza being in hospital.

592
00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.655
I haven't given up on
finding the girl from the movie,


593
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.976
but right now I have no
clue how to continue my search.


594
00:42:06.171 --> 00:42:08.209
I really need to get some sleep,

595
00:42:08.848 --> 00:42:10.646
but I can't sleep.

596
00:42:14.283 --> 00:42:19.478
I'm so excited because of my
call for donations on Facebook.


597
00:42:21.316 --> 00:42:24.393
Wait, I'll make it less blurry.

598
00:42:33.623 --> 00:42:37.859
Overnight, from my friends,
we have now 68,000 taka.


599
00:42:38.026 --> 00:42:39.385
Excellent. This is excellent.

600
00:42:42.654 --> 00:42:45.212
I mean it's not much,
but it's a good start.


601
00:42:45.372 --> 00:42:48.768
It's more than I thought.
- Yeah, it's a good start.


602
00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:52.510
Shyamal is euphoric
because of the 700 Euros


603
00:42:53.044 --> 00:42:56.203
and he believes it's enough
to start planning a boys' home.


604
00:42:57.719 --> 00:43:00.077
He and Chanchala
also have good news.


605
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:02.114
They found Monica's family.

606
00:43:03.354 --> 00:43:05.272
I'm calling from Faridpur.

607
00:43:06.431 --> 00:43:08.549
What?
- I'm calling from Faridpur.


608
00:43:09.028 --> 00:43:13.903
We picked up your
sister at a bus station.


609
00:43:15.142 --> 00:43:17.859
When we find underage girls,

610
00:43:18.019 --> 00:43:21.096
we must deliver
them to the police.


611
00:43:21.256 --> 00:43:26.291
We delivered her to
the government home.


612
00:43:26.531 --> 00:43:28.129
You don't understand.

613
00:43:28.289 --> 00:43:31.765
They won't hand her over to us.

614
00:43:31.925 --> 00:43:36.401
She can only be
consigned to a relative.


615
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.358
If you don't come,
she will rot away.


616
00:43:39.518 --> 00:43:40.996
Is that what you want?

617
00:43:43.633 --> 00:43:49.068
He's saying, "Is it possible
to talk with my sister?"


618
00:43:49.228 --> 00:43:50.267
Ah, yeah.

619
00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:52.744
I said, "Yes, it's possible.
We'll call you."


620
00:44:01.935 --> 00:44:05.851
It will be very tough for
my family to hear all this.


621
00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:09.527
We won't tell them,
and you shouldn't either.


622
00:44:09.687 --> 00:44:12.445
If they heard what I had to do,

623
00:44:12.604 --> 00:44:15.442
they would hang themselves.

624
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:21.436
We need to tell the same story.

625
00:44:21.595 --> 00:44:23.513
You have been married.

626
00:44:23.673 --> 00:44:26.391
And we picked you up,

627
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.428
when you were hanging around

628
00:44:29.587 --> 00:44:32.544
at the bus station.

629
00:44:34.942 --> 00:44:37.300
You thought that I was dead?

630
00:44:41.575 --> 00:44:43.613
No, I'm in the government home.

631
00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:51.565
You need to come and pick me up.

632
00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.717
Can you bring Kamrul?

633
00:45:05.192 --> 00:45:08.588
No, first you need
to go to Dhaka,


634
00:45:09.627 --> 00:45:11.745
then you take the
bus to Faridpur.


635
00:45:11.905 --> 00:45:17.180
Once you are in Faridpur,
you call this number.


636
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:21.495
Then somebody will
come and pick you up.


637
00:45:24.413 --> 00:45:26.450
No, there won't be any problems.

638
00:45:33.284 --> 00:45:36.920
First you come here and
then I will take care of Dad.


639
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.708
Did your brother believe you?

640
00:45:52.025 --> 00:45:54.582
My brother loves me so much,

641
00:45:54.742 --> 00:45:56.860
he would believe anything.

642
00:46:20.317 --> 00:46:23.993
Why are the girls so locked away

643
00:46:24.153 --> 00:46:25.951
and the boys so free?

644
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.534
Right, right. They're bounded,
but, uh, girls are bounded,


645
00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:32.622
but boys are free.

646
00:46:32.744 --> 00:46:33.823
Yes, why?

647
00:46:33.956 --> 00:46:37.779
It's, uh, gender violence.

648
00:46:37.939 --> 00:46:39.338
Gender violence?

649
00:46:40.376 --> 00:46:45.212
It's suited for our environment.

650
00:46:46.011 --> 00:46:49.088
But is it not possible
to change, you know,


651
00:46:49.113 --> 00:46:50.406
to make it more nice?

652
00:46:50.451 --> 00:46:54.243
We should take a project

653
00:46:54.268 --> 00:46:56.920
for the whole country.

654
00:46:56.945 --> 00:46:58.598
Or for the whole world.

655
00:47:05.939 --> 00:47:08.376
Crying echoes
through the corridors.


656
00:47:09.287 --> 00:47:12.277
The home manager had told Padma,
the girl that


657
00:47:12.302 --> 00:47:14.837
we brought to the
government home yesterday,


658
00:47:14.862 --> 00:47:17.979
that for now, her parents
didn't want to see her.


659
00:47:18.925 --> 00:47:20.075
She will have to stay in the

660
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.931
government home
for an indefinite time.


661
00:47:22.095 --> 00:47:25.292
But I can't be without you,
Mama.


662
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.518
Oh, Allah...

663
00:47:43.274 --> 00:47:45.112
Mama.

664
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.866
How can you be without me?

665
00:48:30.052 --> 00:48:33.762
All the girls had stood
around Padma, looking at her.


666
00:48:34.502 --> 00:48:36.855
But none of them had
tried to console her.


667
00:48:38.304 --> 00:48:41.581
Maybe their own
suffering is too severe.


668
00:48:56.081 --> 00:48:59.158
The next morning I
feel like staying in bed.


669
00:49:00.245 --> 00:49:03.010
When I miss our
common breakfast, Redoy


670
00:49:03.035 --> 00:49:05.439
and Shyamal
decide pay me a visit.


671
00:49:07.269 --> 00:49:08.788
Michael, it's me.

672
00:49:10.067 --> 00:49:11.425
Open up.

673
00:49:21.815 --> 00:49:23.174
Are you sick?

674
00:49:25.172 --> 00:49:26.370
Fever?

675
00:49:32.244 --> 00:49:33.803
Are you OK?

676
00:49:33.963 --> 00:49:35.721
Yes, are you OK?

677
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.117
We made a short cost analysis

678
00:49:40.276 --> 00:49:42.263
the budget analysis,
that we were


679
00:49:42.287 --> 00:49:44.432
planning from the beginning.

680
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:51.985
Maybe within that money it's
possible to buy these things.


681
00:49:52.145 --> 00:49:55.621
We're thinking that
before you leave, we'll start.


682
00:49:55.781 --> 00:49:57.899
And the city mayor

683
00:49:58.059 --> 00:50:00.936
will invite you to
open the center.


684
00:50:01.104 --> 00:50:04.180
You think that's possible before
I leave on third of March?


685
00:50:04.332 --> 00:50:05.731
Yeah, why not?

686
00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:08.368
We need to find a room.
- Yes.


687
00:50:12.604 --> 00:50:14.202
Hi, Michael.
- Hi.


688
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:17.120
Come into our house.

689
00:50:17.765 --> 00:50:19.053
Thank you, thank you.

690
00:50:19.374 --> 00:50:21.051
To be honest,
I don't believe we will be


691
00:50:21.076 --> 00:50:23.633
able to open a home
in such a short time.


692
00:50:24.712 --> 00:50:26.190
But even if we do,

693
00:50:26.702 --> 00:50:28.584
Redoy makes it
clear that he will never


694
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:31.305
leave his sister
alone in the brothel.


695
00:50:32.025 --> 00:50:34.975
And to buy her freedom from her
Madam is not an option for us


696
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.819
because her Madam would just buy
another girl with that money.


697
00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.928
Shyamal introduces Aleya to me,

698
00:50:42.532 --> 00:50:46.009
a powerful woman who has
some authority in the brothel.


699
00:50:47.128 --> 00:50:48.966
Maybe she can
help Redoy's sister.


700
00:50:50.404 --> 00:50:52.802
She invites us
for tea this afternoon.


701
00:50:57.719 --> 00:51:01.515
If Redoy's Madam finds out

702
00:51:02.514 --> 00:51:06.071
that we plan to liberate her,

703
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.748
then she might punish her.

704
00:51:09.347 --> 00:51:12.065
I will organize it in a way

705
00:51:12.224 --> 00:51:14.182
that she can't harm her.

706
00:51:14.342 --> 00:51:17.619
She won't even know that
we have anything to do with it.


707
00:51:18.138 --> 00:51:21.575
Before you leave, they will
be free from their Madam.


708
00:51:23.973 --> 00:51:26.118
Before you go
back to your country,


709
00:51:26.142 --> 00:51:27.449
you will see that she will...

710
00:51:28.688 --> 00:51:30.726
That would make me very happy.

711
00:51:34.042 --> 00:51:35.848
This sounds too good to be true.

712
00:51:36.429 --> 00:51:38.209
But Shyamal seems to trust her.

713
00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:42.347
Aleya asks me why
I came to Bangladesh,


714
00:51:42.796 --> 00:51:46.152
and I realise that Shyamal
has his very own explanation.


715
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:50.426
Michael cried when he
saw a movie in Germany.


716
00:51:50.586 --> 00:51:54.982
He saw that a girl was
forced to be a sex worker.


717
00:51:55.141 --> 00:51:58.698
As an actor, Michael had once
played the son of a prostitute.


718
00:51:58.858 --> 00:52:03.413
That's why he feels so
deeply about these girls.


719
00:52:09.767 --> 00:52:11.325
She used to be mine.

720
00:52:15.002 --> 00:52:16.680
She was under her.

721
00:52:19.597 --> 00:52:21.595
Did I understand correctly?

722
00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:24.723
I had almost given up my search.

723
00:52:25.678 --> 00:52:28.169
And now this friendly
woman was apparently


724
00:52:28.194 --> 00:52:30.406
the owner of the
girl from the movie?


725
00:52:32.704 --> 00:52:35.541
That's Nupur. She works
in the C&amp;B brothel now.


726
00:52:36.878 --> 00:52:39.377
What's her name?
- Nupur.


727
00:52:39.817 --> 00:52:41.695
That's her. They filmed it here.

728
00:52:41.855 --> 00:52:45.091
She's not as pretty anymore
as she was during the interview.


729
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.848
Yes, her words touch the heart.

730
00:53:15.399 --> 00:53:18.596
On the other side of the river,
the brothel.


731
00:53:20.586 --> 00:53:21.825
Nupur.

732
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.346
Seven years have
passed since she


733
00:53:25.371 --> 00:53:26.720
was interviewed for the movie.

734
00:53:27.903 --> 00:53:30.780
My visit must seem
more than absurd to her.


735
00:53:34.018 --> 00:53:36.056
What is she going to think?

736
00:53:48.668 --> 00:53:52.184
He saw the video in Germany.

737
00:53:52.344 --> 00:53:56.660
And his heart felt the pain.

738
00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.097
He came here and
asked everybody,


739
00:53:59.257 --> 00:54:02.814
"Where can I find this girl?"

740
00:54:05.131 --> 00:54:09.926
He wanted to find
you and meet you.


741
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.838
The girl in the video
asks questions.


742
00:54:19.877 --> 00:54:22.714
Does she have answers
to those questions?


743
00:54:22.874 --> 00:54:27.908
You had asked why this
life was so full of suffering.


744
00:54:28.268 --> 00:54:33.423
And you were wondering
if there was another way.


745
00:54:33.743 --> 00:54:37.139
Do you have an
answer to this question?


746
00:54:42.734 --> 00:54:44.132
The answer...

747
00:54:46.969 --> 00:54:48.768
At that time

748
00:54:49.207 --> 00:54:52.724
I had been thinking
that I knew the answer.


749
00:54:52.883 --> 00:54:56.440
Because I had been forced into
prostitution against my will.


750
00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.597
But now I'm not
really forced anymore.


751
00:55:05.751 --> 00:55:08.708
I want an honorable job,
I want to get out of this place.


752
00:55:08.867 --> 00:55:10.426
What can I do?

753
00:55:11.585 --> 00:55:13.023
I can't find a way.

754
00:55:15.021 --> 00:55:17.819
I'm tired of fighting.

755
00:55:22.174 --> 00:55:25.651
She doesn't want to stay
here and fight like this.


756
00:55:27.928 --> 00:55:29.966
Can you ask her
how I could help?


757
00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:34.322
He wants to know

758
00:55:34.482 --> 00:55:38.678
if there is something
he could help with?


759
00:55:51.984 --> 00:55:53.663
Could I step out briefly?

760
00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.299
But we can also leave.

761
00:55:58.618 --> 00:56:00.336
We can go outside now.

762
00:56:01.295 --> 00:56:02.694
Yes, of course.

763
00:56:03.213 --> 00:56:06.090
What will she do now?
- She's telling...


764
00:56:09.886 --> 00:56:13.922
Her honesty,
Her thoughtful way of talking...


765
00:56:14.551 --> 00:56:17.625
Without any doubt Nupur
is the girl from the movie.


766
00:56:18.856 --> 00:56:20.034
Back then she was sure

767
00:56:20.059 --> 00:56:21.598
that to get access
to a better life


768
00:56:21.623 --> 00:56:23.521
she had to get away
from her Madam.


769
00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:26.759
When she finally escaped,
she understood that the


770
00:56:26.784 --> 00:56:29.427
path back into society
was permanently blocked.


771
00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.491
Still being here without
being directly forced


772
00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:37.197
felt more shameful to
her than being in bondage.


773
00:56:44.851 --> 00:56:46.170
But for you?

774
00:56:47.489 --> 00:56:49.007
I'm not thirsty right now.

775
00:56:50.805 --> 00:56:52.644
Will he forget me?

776
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:56.720
How could I forget her?

777
00:57:04.552 --> 00:57:06.638
We decide to meet
again in two days to


778
00:57:06.663 --> 00:57:08.623
discuss with Shyamal
what we could do.


779
00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:10.827
Now we must leave.

780
00:57:11.617 --> 00:57:14.933
A client Nupur can't
refuse will soon arrive.


781
00:57:55.648 --> 00:57:57.486
While we were visiting Nupur,

782
00:57:57.905 --> 00:58:00.877
the preparations for the home
had been running at full speed.


783
00:58:01.404 --> 00:58:04.459
And a period starts during
which we work day and night.


784
00:58:05.327 --> 00:58:09.349
We meet politicians,
bankers, potential supervisors,


785
00:58:10.241 --> 00:58:12.501
and visit every
place which could


786
00:58:12.526 --> 00:58:14.934
in any way be used as a home.

787
00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:21.170
We order beds, buy
clothing and school supplies.


788
00:58:22.196 --> 00:58:24.156
Luckily, Chanchala and
Shyamal know what


789
00:58:24.181 --> 00:58:25.819
to do from building
the girls' home.


790
00:58:26.233 --> 00:58:28.348
So things go fast and smoothly.

791
00:58:29.107 --> 00:58:30.351
We call the project

792
00:58:30.363 --> 00:58:32.920
"Bondhu" -project,
friends'-project,


793
00:58:33.483 --> 00:58:36.128
as all the money was
donated by friends.


794
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.898
How do you feel?

795
00:58:38.578 --> 00:58:39.976
It's amazing.

796
00:58:41.135 --> 00:58:43.972
Because we are
getting a new family.


797
00:58:45.571 --> 00:58:46.849
Are you tired?

798
00:58:47.409 --> 00:58:48.807
So tired.

799
00:58:49.607 --> 00:58:51.445
But it's amazing.

800
00:59:14.373 --> 00:59:18.702
I admit that, while happy,
I'm also a bit nervous,


801
00:59:18.727 --> 00:59:21.260
when the kids come
to sign up for the home.


802
00:59:22.423 --> 00:59:25.273
How big is the responsibility
I'm about to take on?


803
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.872
On the other hand, I will have

804
00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.895
thousands of
kilometers of privacy,


805
00:59:30.202 --> 00:59:33.360
while Chanchala and Shyamal
are really getting a new family.


806
00:59:34.343 --> 00:59:36.563
And they don't seem
to be worried at all.


807
00:59:45.071 --> 00:59:47.549
Will you take me?

808
00:59:47.708 --> 00:59:52.024
Can he go to the Bondhu-project?

809
00:59:52.184 --> 00:59:55.580
He has no clue where he belongs.
He lives in the brothel.


810
00:59:57.459 --> 00:59:58.617
Take me, I will study.

811
00:59:58.777 --> 01:00:01.135
You don't have family?
- No, nobody.


812
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.772
He has no-one?
- No.


813
01:00:03.932 --> 01:00:05.531
Who is taking care of him now?

814
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:10.366
He's staying at somebody's
house and working.


815
01:00:10.526 --> 01:00:11.804
Really?
- Yes.


816
01:00:12.324 --> 01:00:13.523
Yes, then he can come.

817
01:00:14.282 --> 01:00:16.639
You can pick him up
tomorrow at ten o'clock.


818
01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:18.557
Then you come with me.

819
01:00:18.717 --> 01:00:22.314
I will be here and
come out of this stable.


820
01:00:23.592 --> 01:00:25.111
What's your name?
- Maruk.


821
01:00:25.271 --> 01:00:27.429
Michael. Nice to meet you.

822
01:00:27.588 --> 01:00:28.947
Can you take a picture of me?

823
01:00:29.107 --> 01:00:30.106
Don't worry.

824
01:00:30.665 --> 01:00:33.263
You'll have enough
time for taking pictures.


825
01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:50.536
Nupur has built up
some debts during the


826
01:00:50.548 --> 01:00:53.306
last few years,
which we just can't pay.


827
01:00:53.763 --> 01:00:56.738
They are almost as high
as the costs for the kids' home.


828
01:00:57.618 --> 01:00:59.934
Nupur thinks she
could pay part of it, if


829
01:00:59.959 --> 01:01:02.142
she worked another
six months at the brothel.


830
01:01:02.879 --> 01:01:04.819
She asks us to
finance a training


831
01:01:04.844 --> 01:01:06.669
course in a beauty parlor.

832
01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:10.207
It wasn't easy to find
somebody to train her.


833
01:01:10.832 --> 01:01:13.059
But the combination of
Shyamal's connections and


834
01:01:13.084 --> 01:01:16.833
the "white man with camera"
strategy made it happen.


835
01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:23.692
We don't have many
clients in the mornings,


836
01:01:23.852 --> 01:01:27.968
most of them come
in the afternoon.


837
01:01:28.128 --> 01:01:31.085
It's the same in the brothel.
- At what time?


838
01:01:31.252 --> 01:01:35.767
At three o'clock or
latest at half past four.


839
01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:39.956
She can come at 10 o'clock.

840
01:01:40.116 --> 01:01:41.674
OK. Very good.

841
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:47.309
She can start tomorrow.

842
01:01:48.188 --> 01:01:50.346
It will be very busy tomorrow.

843
01:01:50.505 --> 01:01:52.171
Tomorrow is the busy day?

844
01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.654
Tomorrow, yes?

845
01:01:53.756 --> 01:01:55.239
Their busy day, so...

846
01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.657
She can come from the
day after tomorrow.


847
01:01:58.817 --> 01:02:01.494
OK. They have busy
day here tomorrow?


848
01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:05.266
Ah, OK, OK.
No, in the brothel.


849
01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:06.569
OK, so the day after tomorrow.

850
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:11.514
Since she was 14, 
Nupur has been

851
01:02:11.539 --> 01:02:14.352
living in the
brothel. Now we all


852
01:02:14.377 --> 01:02:17.116
hope that in six months, a new

853
01:02:17.141 --> 01:02:18.732
stage of life will
begin for her.


854
01:02:22.379 --> 01:02:24.127
The last days of my stay,

855
01:02:24.876 --> 01:02:26.584
and there is one
more journey to make.


856
01:02:27.879 --> 01:02:29.400
Monica's family can't come

857
01:02:29.424 --> 01:02:30.903
to the government
home to pick her up.


858
01:02:31.568 --> 01:02:33.855
But the home management
makes an exception


859
01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.682
and allows us to
drive her to her family.


860
01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:39.433
As a farewell present from me,

861
01:02:39.669 --> 01:02:42.668
the girls had asked for a
small karaoke machine.


862
01:02:43.387 --> 01:02:45.978
Now they sing a
farewell song for Monica.


863
01:03:27.408 --> 01:03:29.406
When I saw you the first time,

864
01:03:29.566 --> 01:03:31.604
I thought you
were like my father.


865
01:03:33.869 --> 01:03:37.505
Finally, Monica and her
brother are lying in each


866
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:40.955
other's arms for the
first time in four years.


867
01:03:42.393 --> 01:03:45.111
I couldn't believe that
you were still alive.


868
01:04:07.448 --> 01:04:10.286
I'll hide in your luggage
to come with you.


869
01:04:10.445 --> 01:04:14.521
If he loves me,
he will take me with him.


870
01:04:14.681 --> 01:04:16.719
If he doesn't, he won't.

871
01:04:16.959 --> 01:04:20.076
You can tell him that I would
really love to take him with me,


872
01:04:20.236 --> 01:04:22.673
but it's not possible,
it's against the law.


873
01:04:22.833 --> 01:04:25.350
Believe me, he really loves you,

874
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:29.027
but the government won't
allow him to bring you.


875
01:04:29.746 --> 01:04:34.501
That's not true. I will
travel in his luggage.


876
01:04:34.661 --> 01:04:36.339
How will you do that?

877
01:04:37.059 --> 01:04:38.857
Nobody can stop me,
I'll go with him.


878
01:04:39.017 --> 01:04:40.256
How?

879
01:04:40.415 --> 01:04:42.493
Bring me along
and I will make it.


880
01:04:43.253 --> 01:04:45.131
How can I stay here?

881
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.663
Redoy decided not to leave his
sister alone in the brothel,


882
01:04:58.529 --> 01:05:00.267
so he's not amongst
the boys who will


883
01:05:00.292 --> 01:05:02.054
now move into the Bondhu home.

884
01:05:07.884 --> 01:05:10.550
We had finally managed to rent a
little house.


885
01:05:13.971 --> 01:05:15.508
Many of the boys have never met,

886
01:05:16.147 --> 01:05:17.428
but all of them are eager

887
01:05:17.453 --> 01:05:19.940
to help to make
it their new home.


888
01:05:32.851 --> 01:05:35.090
If I had to guess
what Nupur would


889
01:05:35.115 --> 01:05:37.193
ask for as a farewell present,

890
01:05:37.835 --> 01:05:41.115
I would never have imagined
it would be a big teddy bear.


891
01:05:41.843 --> 01:05:43.907
But I also would not
have imagined that one


892
01:05:43.932 --> 01:05:47.293
could take three hours
to choose the right one.


893
01:05:48.587 --> 01:05:50.225
She does not seem
completely happy.


894
01:05:50.385 --> 01:05:53.222
I think it should be a bear,
she's seeing the bear,


895
01:05:53.247 --> 01:05:55.540
and then she... her heart
jumps and says,


896
01:05:55.565 --> 01:05:57.019
"Oh, I want that one."

897
01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:06.649
All right, she likes this one?

898
01:06:08.527 --> 01:06:10.445
Ask him if he likes it.

899
01:06:10.605 --> 01:06:13.522
Do you like this one?
- Yes, I like it. I like him.


900
01:06:13.682 --> 01:06:15.680
Are you lying or
telling the truth?


901
01:06:22.193 --> 01:06:24.791
I'm so happy,
I would have never thought


902
01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:29.546
that things could
change like that.


903
01:06:30.225 --> 01:06:33.862
You know,
I lived in a dark place


904
01:06:34.022 --> 01:06:35.860
and now there's light.

905
01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.576
To be honest, I wonder
how all this happened to me.


906
01:06:39.736 --> 01:06:42.773
What if I don't manage to
follow through with all this?


907
01:06:42.933 --> 01:06:46.169
The journey that I have started,
will I be able to finish it?


908
01:06:47.728 --> 01:06:50.086
Sometimes I get
scared. Will I make it?


909
01:06:50.565 --> 01:06:51.804
I mean...

910
01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:54.082
I don't know.

911
01:06:54.241 --> 01:06:57.318
When I was a kid,
I had this dream,


912
01:06:57.478 --> 01:06:59.356
that I would study

913
01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:04.032
and take care of my
mother and my sisters.


914
01:07:04.191 --> 01:07:06.070
So many things have happened...

915
01:07:10.066 --> 01:07:11.864
Back then I was so full of hope.

916
01:07:34.854 --> 01:07:36.739
When I say goodbye to Redoy,

917
01:07:37.313 --> 01:07:38.877
he's still living in the
brothel.


918
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:42.506
It has not been possible
to liberate his sister yet.


919
01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:45.535
Her Madam is too powerful.

920
01:07:55.646 --> 01:07:58.460
He only allows me
to leave under the promise


921
01:07:58.731 --> 01:08:00.824
that I will
come back in one year.


922
01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:05.531
By then, he says,
he will also have grown a beard.


923
01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:15.706
Redoy's sister
couldn't get free.


924
01:09:15.730 --> 01:09:18.017
But they managed
to run off together.


925
01:09:18.177 --> 01:09:21.374
For some years there
was no trace of them.


926
01:09:22.973 --> 01:09:24.439
Recently I received
a message that


927
01:09:24.463 --> 01:09:25.930
they had been seen in Faridpur.

928
01:09:26.089 --> 01:09:30.085
I really hope to see
them on my next visit.


929
01:09:33.562 --> 01:09:35.088
Nupur finished her job training.

930
01:09:35.112 --> 01:09:36.879
Sometimes she
works as a cosmetician.


931
01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:39.476
But she fell in love with a
staff member from the brothel


932
01:09:39.636 --> 01:09:44.271
and hasn't made it
out of prostitution yet.


933
01:09:48.947 --> 01:09:50.593
Hafeza reported
her Madam and her


934
01:09:50.617 --> 01:09:52.263
human trafficker to the police.

935
01:09:52.423 --> 01:09:56.419
Because of bribes, her
Madam wasn't punished.


936
01:09:57.538 --> 01:10:00.335
But the trafficker is
in pre-trial custody.


937
01:10:00.495 --> 01:10:03.452
Despite the hostilities
from the village community


938
01:10:03.612 --> 01:10:07.608
Hafeza was readmitted
into her family.


939
01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:13.722
Padma's parents allowed her to
come home after three months.


940
01:10:13.882 --> 01:10:17.878
She lives with her family now.

941
01:10:21.434 --> 01:10:23.040
The girls' situation
in the "safe home"


942
01:10:23.064 --> 01:10:24.671
is improving very slowly.

943
01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:26.213
Society and their
families consider


944
01:10:26.237 --> 01:10:27.908
them as perpetrators
and not as victims.


945
01:10:28.067 --> 01:10:31.072
This makes it
impossible for them to


946
01:10:31.096 --> 01:10:34.101
have a free and
self-determined life.


947
01:10:38.936 --> 01:10:41.334
Faridpur has now two homes
for kids from the brothels.


948
01:10:41.494 --> 01:10:43.892
A Bondhu-home for 23
boys and one for 50 girls.


949
01:10:44.051 --> 01:10:46.609
The kids are supervised

950
01:10:47.927 --> 01:10:49.366
The homes are run by
Chanchala and Shyamal


951
01:10:49.388 --> 01:10:50.781
with support from
the Bondhu-project.


952
01:10:50.805 --> 01:10:52.922
We get in contact once a week.

953
01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:57.798
Once a year I go to
Bangladesh to visit everyone.


954
01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:05.989
Special thanks to the
women and girls in this movie


955
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:08.267
for sharing their story with us,

956
01:11:08.427 --> 01:11:10.865
and their courage to
speak in front of the camera.
