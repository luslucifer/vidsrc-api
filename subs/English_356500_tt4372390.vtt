00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:22.470
("Stranger" by Goldfrapp plays)

2
00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:56.188
Lecturer: A man suffocated
his baby daughter


3
00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:58.315
and put her in a bag outside
Houston station.


4
00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:00.943
Ordinarily, this would've been
a death penalty case,


5
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.988
but the killer made it
to Mexico,


6
00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:06.490
and now faces life
without parole.


7
00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:08.701
So, what does that teach us?

8
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.955
It teaches us that no law
or ordinance


9
00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:15.166
is mightier than understanding.

10
00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.879
Know the rule of law,
and you can bend it.


11
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:22.715
Understand its workings,

12
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:26.177
and you can turn
first degree murder...


13
00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.221
into second degree murder.

14
00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:32.183
Second degree into manslaughter.

15
00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:38.731
Hey, ho, Harper! Harper, buddy!
Wait up, man!


16
00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:40.733
I got the baddest story
for you, dude.


17
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.360
I was at the Depot this weekend
with the Chinaman,


18
00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:44.820
and I dropped liquid acid.

19
00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:46.530
Oh, yeah? How did that pan out?

20
00:02:46.697 --> 00:02:48.324
Terrible. Not good at all.

21
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.951
Trip lasted 18 hours,
and then when I came to,


22
00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:52.161
my hair turned white.

23
00:02:52.328 --> 00:02:53.537
Yeah. It's white.

24
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:55.414
Paul: (whispers)
Here's the thing, though,


25
00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.208
I don't remember being scared
or anything.


26
00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:59.418
Don't get me wrong,
it was intense but it was fun.


27
00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.670
So I go see the doctor,
ask him what he thinks about it.


28
00:03:01.837 --> 00:03:04.131
He says that it might not even
be related to the acid at all,


29
00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:05.382
that it could be hormonal.

30
00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.218
If my pituitary gland is fucked,

31
00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:09.053
starts kicking out loads
of estrogen,


32
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.013
I can grow tits or turn gay
or something.


33
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.224
I mean, what's worse,
being straight guy with tits,


34
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.267
or waking up and all of a sudden
you crave dicks?


35
00:03:15.392 --> 00:03:17.603
Worse than that, you crave dicks
and your hair starts turning grey.


36
00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:19.104
I'll look like a gay skunk.

37
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:21.774
Well, now, what's your problem?

38
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.275
My mom's in a coma.

39
00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:25.569
Oh, fuck.

40
00:03:26.737 --> 00:03:29.114
Harper, dude, man.
I'm sorry, bro.


41
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:31.242
Of course she's in a coma.
What the fuck am I?


42
00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:33.410
Am I the worst fucking friend
or the worst fucking friend?


43
00:03:33.577 --> 00:03:34.995
It's all right.
Just forget about it.


44
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.789
- Bullshit, man. I can't.
- (car lock chirps)


45
00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:38.958
It's unforgivable.
I've been so focused on my own shit,


46
00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:41.001
my hair turning different
colors. I should've made time.


47
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.920
No, it's all right, man.
You were busy.


48
00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:44.255
Hey.

49
00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:46.423
Harper, buddy, what is this?

50
00:03:46.674 --> 00:03:48.884
What are you doing to me here,
you putting the guilts on me?


51
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:50.052
Huh?

52
00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:52.846
Come on, man,
you know I love your mom.


53
00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:54.181
I just forgot, that's all.

54
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.641
Yeah, man. I know.

55
00:03:56.517 --> 00:03:57.518
I know.

56
00:03:58.394 --> 00:03:59.353
See you later.

57
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.063
- (engine starts up)
- All right, buddy.


58
00:04:01.563 --> 00:04:02.773
See you later.

59
00:04:06.944 --> 00:04:10.155
(heart monitor beeps)

60
00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.377
Nurse: (over P.A.)
<i>Paging Dr. Holmer to Neurology.</i>


61
00:04:24.878 --> 00:04:26.964
<i>Paging Dr. Holmer to Neurology.</i>

62
00:04:34.263 --> 00:04:37.599
"One flew east, one flew west,

63
00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:40.019
one flew over
the cuckoo's nest."


64
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.523
(heart monitor beeps)

65
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.672
- (indistinct chatter)
- (sirens wail over TV)


66
00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.799
Man: (over TV) <i>Their quest
for the American dream</i>


67
00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:12.676
<i>can become a nightmare.</i>

68
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.386
(tires screeching)

69
00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:18.140
<i>And even though this man ran far
and fast enough to get away...</i>


70
00:05:18.307 --> 00:05:20.726
Man 2: (over TV) <i>Going into
a very heavily wooded area.</i>


71
00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:23.062
Man: (over TV) <i>...he's starting
his new life in America</i>


72
00:05:23.228 --> 00:05:24.772
<i>as a fugitive.</i>

73
00:05:26.565 --> 00:05:27.566
<i>Golden Colorado.</i>

74
00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:29.193
Can I get some...

75
00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:30.986
(speech continues over TV)

76
00:05:31.695 --> 00:05:33.405
Man: (in bar)
He starts getting physical.


77
00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:35.074
Now, you see my Cherry...

78
00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:38.535
she's got a dollar sign where
most other girls got a heart.


79
00:05:38.702 --> 00:05:40.662
And this John,
he picks up on it.


80
00:05:41.205 --> 00:05:43.707
He says, "You like money,
don't you, you fucking whore?"


81
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:46.543
She says,
"I like money and cock,


82
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.213
and from where I'm sitting,
you don't got neither."


83
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.382
- (laughing)
- Man 2: She said that?


84
00:05:51.548 --> 00:05:53.509
- (laughing)
- Man 2: So what did he do?


85
00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:57.846
Pulls a knife,
cuts her right on her cheek.


86
00:05:58.013 --> 00:05:59.014
Right there.

87
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.228
Motherfucker, it's gonna cost me
a fortune.


88
00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:06.939
So anyway, Cherry starts
going crazy, as you can imagine.


89
00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:09.191
I can hear her screaming
from the hallway.


90
00:06:09.316 --> 00:06:11.860
She's screaming like Fred Krueger's
got his finger up her ass.


91
00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:13.028
(laughter)

92
00:06:13.195 --> 00:06:14.613
I come around
to see what the fuck!


93
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.449
Cherry's pulled a gun.
She's standing there.


94
00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:19.326
She got a Beretta
pointed at his head.


95
00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:20.494
She's shaking.

96
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.913
I tried to talk her 'round,
but, well...


97
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.623
- (gunshots)
- Bam, bam, bam.


98
00:06:28.293 --> 00:06:30.462
Guess who had to clean up
the fucking mess?


99
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:31.922
- Man 2: Holy shit.
- Mm-hm.


100
00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:35.259
Who the fuck is this guy?

101
00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:37.803
Watch out.
Get the fuck outta here.


102
00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:40.639
Didn't your mother tell you
it's rude


103
00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:43.183
to listen in
on other people's talk?


104
00:06:44.893 --> 00:06:46.979
- Not recently.
- What did you say?


105
00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:48.730
My mother's not doing so well,

106
00:06:48.897 --> 00:06:51.692
so she hasn't really been honing
my social skills recently.


107
00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:53.068
But what I think you're saying

108
00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:55.070
is that maybe
she shouldn't have to.


109
00:06:56.738 --> 00:06:58.073
You're running your mouth at me.

110
00:06:58.574 --> 00:07:00.033
Bartender: Johnny, come on, man.
He's drunk.


111
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.827
He's a grown-up.
He knows what he said.


112
00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:03.996
Go home, buddy. 
It's late, okay?

113
00:07:04.163 --> 00:07:05.414
We don't want
any trouble tonight.


114
00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:08.375
Oh, it's not late.
It's not even ten o'clock yet.


115
00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.587
And whilst I appreciate your concern,
tomorrow morning,


116
00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:14.465
when I wake up
and look myself in the mirror,


117
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:17.301
I'd rather see
a face full of bruises...


118
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:20.345
than a face full of shame.

119
00:07:21.597 --> 00:07:22.973
(chuckles)

120
00:07:24.558 --> 00:07:28.604
And I'm prepared to go and buy
all your friends over there a drink.


121
00:07:29.354 --> 00:07:30.731
As an apology.

122
00:07:31.482 --> 00:07:34.234
Beyond that, go fuck yourselves.

123
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.111
Let it go, Johnny.

124
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:38.572
You can buy me a drink.

125
00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:41.033
I'll have a bottle of Scotch,
but we drink it together.


126
00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:44.953
I'm not really in a social mood.

127
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.371
I'm not asking.

128
00:07:46.788 --> 00:07:49.583
Either we drink together, or we
go round and round right here.


129
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.919
- Come on, Johnny.
- Shut the fuck up, fat man!


130
00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:53.670
(scoffs)

131
00:07:54.505 --> 00:07:56.798
- Are you laughing at me?
- (giggles)


132
00:07:57.925 --> 00:07:59.051
He's laughing at you.

133
00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:01.345
(giggles)

134
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.142
- Follow me.
- Where we going?


135
00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:09.520
What, you scared?

136
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.605
Are you scared of me?

137
00:08:12.147 --> 00:08:14.066
If I was gonna kill you,
I'd do it already.


138
00:08:14.733 --> 00:08:16.026
Trust me, you'll like it.

139
00:08:16.193 --> 00:08:18.820
You like chocolate sundaes?

140
00:08:19.404 --> 00:08:21.406
- Yeah. Where we going?
- You like girls?


141
00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:25.869
♪ (dance music plays) ♪

142
00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:42.886
- I'll take that.
- These aren't for you, Johnny.


143
00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:44.137
Yes, they are.

144
00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:57.150
(cell phone chimes)

145
00:09:02.197 --> 00:09:03.574
(sighs)

146
00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:27.222
Johnny: So, uh...
What you wanna be?


147
00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:29.474
What, when I grow up?

148
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:32.019
Yeah, what you wanna be
when you grow up?


149
00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:34.896
- A criminal lawyer.
- Defense, I hope.


150
00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:36.523
Yeah, defense.

151
00:09:36.982 --> 00:09:39.026
What happens if you get
someone off who's guilty


152
00:09:39.192 --> 00:09:41.069
and then they go out
and play ball again?


153
00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:44.489
Just blame the prosecution
for not building a solid case.


154
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.950
I mean, people have a right
to a good defense.


155
00:09:47.117 --> 00:09:48.619
Rich people, you mean.

156
00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:50.120
All people.

157
00:09:50.287 --> 00:09:52.080
Two days a week
I'm working for free.


158
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:54.374
What, so you're a crusader?

159
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.835
Look, I don't wear a cape,
but...


160
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.254
I do find it very hard
to walk away from injustice.


161
00:09:59.588 --> 00:10:01.882
You be sure to give me your
number when you graduate.


162
00:10:02.132 --> 00:10:03.342
(chuckles) Yeah.

163
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:08.597
What about you? Do you have
an area of expertise?


164
00:10:09.765 --> 00:10:11.266
- You need something doing?
- No.


165
00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:12.809
- Of course not. I just--
- What?


166
00:10:12.976 --> 00:10:13.977
- You know...
- What?


167
00:10:16.146 --> 00:10:17.981
I just like to hear
the other side.


168
00:10:18.148 --> 00:10:19.483
No, no, no.

169
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.152
Your face.
You was thinking something.


170
00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:23.654
Nah, I wasn't really.

171
00:10:24.404 --> 00:10:25.405
Speak.

172
00:10:29.117 --> 00:10:30.410
I don't know. My--

173
00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:33.872
My step dad's a fucking asshole,
and...


174
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:35.832
And?

175
00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:39.628
And sometimes I think it'd be
something if someone were to...


176
00:10:40.504 --> 00:10:42.589
ruffle his feathers a little.
You catch my drift?


177
00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:44.091
No, I don't catch your drift.

178
00:10:44.257 --> 00:10:46.385
"Ruffle his feathers"?
What, is he a bird?


179
00:10:46.843 --> 00:10:48.095
No, I mean... You know.

180
00:10:49.012 --> 00:10:50.055
Teach him a lesson.

181
00:10:50.222 --> 00:10:52.140
Yeah. What, science, math, what?

182
00:10:52.307 --> 00:10:53.892
Come on, man,
you know what I'm saying.


183
00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:56.978
I don't know what you're saying!
Teach him a lesson, I mean...


184
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.358
You know, some guys I know,
that means kill him.


185
00:11:01.525 --> 00:11:02.859
That what you mean?

186
00:11:03.026 --> 00:11:04.236
No, of course not. I just...

187
00:11:04.903 --> 00:11:06.530
I mean beat him up a little
maybe.


188
00:11:06.697 --> 00:11:09.157
You gonna beat on somebody,
you gotta have a cause.


189
00:11:10.909 --> 00:11:12.744
No, no, no. No more drinking.

190
00:11:13.036 --> 00:11:14.454
Finish your story.

191
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.748
(sighing)

192
00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:20.168
All right, so three months ago,
my mom gets in a car crash.


193
00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:22.045
She's driving,
he's in the passenger seat.


194
00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:23.338
They're both drunk.

195
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.051
The car comes off the road,
they hit a tree, all right?


196
00:11:28.218 --> 00:11:30.429
And she's been in a coma
ever since.


197
00:11:30.595 --> 00:11:32.097
And you blame him for it?

198
00:11:32.764 --> 00:11:34.182
I blame him

199
00:11:34.349 --> 00:11:36.768
because he's visited her
once in the hospital


200
00:11:36.935 --> 00:11:37.936
in three months.

201
00:11:38.103 --> 00:11:40.063
And while she's in there
fighting for her life,


202
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.190
he's going off to Vegas
and banging some...


203
00:11:42.524 --> 00:11:45.026
some cocktail waitress
named Rosy Hills.


204
00:11:45.193 --> 00:11:46.278
Probably not much older than me.

205
00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:49.823
(chuckles) Your old man's got
a taste for teen pussy.


206
00:11:54.703 --> 00:11:56.872
My mom got a terrible set
of results tonight.


207
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.041
And if she gets more tomorrow,
then...


208
00:12:01.501 --> 00:12:03.086
she's gonna have
her machine...


209
00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:08.258
Anyway, he knows this.

210
00:12:08.842 --> 00:12:11.261
But tomorrow he's gonna go on
some so-called business trip


211
00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:12.763
to go see his whore in Vegas.

212
00:12:13.597 --> 00:12:14.598
Now...

213
00:12:15.474 --> 00:12:17.100
if that's the way
his mind's working,


214
00:12:17.768 --> 00:12:19.561
if that's what little regard
he has for her,


215
00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:21.146
then who's to say--

216
00:12:21.313 --> 00:12:23.565
Who's to say he didn't
have a hand in her death?


217
00:12:24.357 --> 00:12:25.442
Right.

218
00:12:27.194 --> 00:12:28.737
(drink pouring)

219
00:12:31.114 --> 00:12:32.574
Let me ask you something.

220
00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:37.788
If you could stop time,
cut yourself in half,


221
00:12:38.163 --> 00:12:39.956
and one side of you goes off,

222
00:12:40.123 --> 00:12:41.666
he kills this pussy hound.

223
00:12:41.833 --> 00:12:43.835
The other side,
he stays at home,


224
00:12:44.503 --> 00:12:46.046
don't know nothing about it.

225
00:12:46.379 --> 00:12:48.799
When it's over, the two sides,
they don't speak--


226
00:12:48.965 --> 00:12:51.259
Shit, they don't even know
what the other one's done.


227
00:12:51.426 --> 00:12:53.428
You live your life
with clean hands.


228
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:55.347
Would you do it?

229
00:12:58.558 --> 00:12:59.559
Yes.

230
00:13:00.727 --> 00:13:02.729
That sort of thing
can be had, brother.


231
00:13:08.401 --> 00:13:09.611
How much?

232
00:13:09.778 --> 00:13:12.322
I mean, you know,
hypothetically speaking,


233
00:13:12.489 --> 00:13:14.074
how much would something
like that cost?


234
00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:15.617
Hypo-pathetically speaking,

235
00:13:16.576 --> 00:13:17.786
20 grand.

236
00:13:17.953 --> 00:13:20.121
We drive to Vegas,
clip this jock.


237
00:13:20.288 --> 00:13:21.832
He ends up
in the sand somewhere--


238
00:13:21.998 --> 00:13:22.999
Woman: Hey, boys.

239
00:13:23.667 --> 00:13:25.752
- What's going on?
- Fuck off, Cherry.


240
00:13:27.212 --> 00:13:28.630
No, she can stay. It's fine.

241
00:13:28.797 --> 00:13:30.340
No, she can't stay.

242
00:13:30.507 --> 00:13:32.217
Go on. Go.

243
00:13:42.018 --> 00:13:43.144
Where were we?

244
00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:45.397
(birds chirping)

245
00:13:47.315 --> 00:13:49.734
(water sprinkler pumping)

246
00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:12.507
(cell phone ringing)

247
00:14:20.515 --> 00:14:21.558
Hello?

248
00:14:21.892 --> 00:14:23.310
Operator: <i>Is that Harper James?</i>

249
00:14:23.435 --> 00:14:24.311
Yes.

250
00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:26.146
<i>Dr. Ulmer would like
to speak with you.</i>


251
00:14:26.438 --> 00:14:27.439
Okay.

252
00:14:27.606 --> 00:14:28.732
<i>I'll just connect you.</i>

253
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.026
♪ (hold music plays) ♪

254
00:14:35.363 --> 00:14:36.823

255
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.118
(hangs up)

256
00:15:12.692 --> 00:15:13.777
You all set?

257
00:15:14.903 --> 00:15:15.904
Hm?

258
00:15:17.197 --> 00:15:18.406
Your old man?

259
00:15:18.698 --> 00:15:19.699
Shit.

260
00:15:20.283 --> 00:15:21.952
No. No, no, no.

261
00:15:22.118 --> 00:15:24.329
God, no. I was drunk last night.

262
00:15:24.496 --> 00:15:25.497
Fuck that.

263
00:15:25.664 --> 00:15:27.540
I forgot.
I should've called you.


264
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:29.709
Twenty grand,
three of us drive to Vegas,


265
00:15:29.876 --> 00:15:31.294
you spot him, I shoot.

266
00:15:31.544 --> 00:15:33.880
No.
No, that's not gonna happen.


267
00:15:34.047 --> 00:15:36.341
Oh. Yes, it is.

268
00:15:37.592 --> 00:15:39.844
Look, I said a lot of stuff
last night that I didn't mean.


269
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.054
- You meant it.
- No.


270
00:15:41.137 --> 00:15:42.722
You're just scared, that's all.

271
00:15:42.847 --> 00:15:44.140
No, I was upset last night

272
00:15:44.307 --> 00:15:46.101
I was upset
because of my mother.


273
00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:48.228
- And we're going to Vegas.
- No, we're really not.


274
00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:50.021
Shut your fucking mouth,
all right?


275
00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:52.565
Your nerves are fucking
with you, that's all this is.


276
00:15:52.774 --> 00:15:54.442
Hey, Harper! Everything okay?

277
00:15:55.402 --> 00:15:57.570
Yeah, we're fine, Mr. Parfitt.
Thank you.


278
00:15:57.779 --> 00:15:59.155
Okay, buddy.

279
00:15:59.322 --> 00:16:00.699
Look, man.

280
00:16:00.907 --> 00:16:02.701
I'm sorry, okay?
But I made a mistake.


281
00:16:02.867 --> 00:16:03.994
I...

282
00:16:04.452 --> 00:16:05.578
I apologize.

283
00:16:05.745 --> 00:16:07.747
I don't want
your fucking apologies.


284
00:16:07.872 --> 00:16:09.082
What I want for you to do

285
00:16:09.207 --> 00:16:11.668
is put your money
where your big fucking mouth is.


286
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.640
I'm sorry. I can't.

287
00:16:25.807 --> 00:16:27.726
- We're going to Vegas.
- I'm sorry.


288
00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:30.061
Don't fucking walk away from me!

289
00:16:34.149 --> 00:16:36.776
(breathes heavily)

290
00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:12.687
All right, you know what?
Let's do it, let's go.


291
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.898
Let's got to Vegas.

292
00:17:35.543 --> 00:17:36.711
You made the right choice.

293
00:17:36.878 --> 00:17:39.172
If you hadn't have come, you'd
be sitting at home right now,


294
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.466
thinking about what
could've been instead what is.


295
00:17:41.633 --> 00:17:44.177
(retches)

296
00:17:49.933 --> 00:17:51.267
Johnny: <i>I got a policy.</i>

297
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.395
<i>Don't regret
the things you do,</i>


298
00:17:55.105 --> 00:17:56.397
<i>just the things you don't.</i>

299
00:17:57.899 --> 00:17:59.067
Ain't that right, Cherry?

300
00:18:35.937 --> 00:18:37.147
You going somewhere?

301
00:18:42.861 --> 00:18:44.612
You know what today is, right?

302
00:18:45.363 --> 00:18:47.365
The hospital won't know anything
till 11:00.


303
00:18:48.158 --> 00:18:50.743
- Yeah, did you go up there?
- I called them.


304
00:18:51.077 --> 00:18:52.495
(scoffs) Yeah.

305
00:18:52.704 --> 00:18:54.414
'Cause a visit's
out of the question, right?


306
00:18:54.581 --> 00:18:57.292
Because I have business
to attend to.


307
00:18:58.501 --> 00:18:59.502
Yeah, business.

308
00:19:01.462 --> 00:19:02.672
What's that supposed to mean?

309
00:19:03.756 --> 00:19:04.757
Hm. Oh...

310
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.094
I don't know. You tell me.

311
00:19:08.261 --> 00:19:10.430
The business that will
keep this roof above your head,


312
00:19:10.597 --> 00:19:13.141
if, God forbid, something bad
does happen to your mother.


313
00:19:13.266 --> 00:19:15.226
Something bad already
has happened to my mother.


314
00:19:15.977 --> 00:19:17.145
She met you.

315
00:19:17.312 --> 00:19:18.313
(scoffs)

316
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:27.947
You just got in, right?

317
00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:30.700
Yeah, I just got in. So what?

318
00:19:33.828 --> 00:19:35.496
So I'm guessing
you're still drunk.


319
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.499
Yeah, I'm drunk.

320
00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:44.255
Then maybe you should take a
shower and cool off,


321
00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:47.217
before you say something
you regret.


322
00:20:45.858 --> 00:20:48.403
(engine revving)

323
00:20:48.569 --> 00:20:50.363
Hey, would you mind
if I made a phone call?


324
00:20:50.571 --> 00:20:51.614
To who?

325
00:20:51.823 --> 00:20:53.574
I need to call the hospital
about my mom.


326
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:55.952
- So, go ahead.
- I left my phone.


327
00:20:57.245 --> 00:20:58.579
No, I should use a public phone.

328
00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:00.331
If I use yours and something
goes wrong,


329
00:21:00.498 --> 00:21:01.749
they'll be able to connect us.

330
00:21:01.916 --> 00:21:02.917
Not this phone.

331
00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:06.087
This phone's registered to some
shitbag geriatric in Malibu.


332
00:21:06.254 --> 00:21:08.131
I cover my tracks, man.
Told you that.


333
00:21:08.298 --> 00:21:11.217
I cover other peoples, too.
Ain't that right, Cherry?


334
00:21:12.969 --> 00:21:14.679
So come on,
what are you waiting for?


335
00:21:16.973 --> 00:21:19.392
- It's kind of private.
- I ain't gonna listen.


336
00:21:22.937 --> 00:21:25.440
- It can wait.
- (mouths) Fuck.


337
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.901
You all right?

338
00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:30.820
Cherry?

339
00:21:30.987 --> 00:21:32.739
What?
What is that supposed to mean?


340
00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.906
I'm good, Johnny.

341
00:21:43.249 --> 00:21:46.127
Al: <i>She was facing straight ahead,
so I couldn't see her eyes.</i>


342
00:21:46.294 --> 00:21:48.713
<i>But she was young,
not more than 24.</i>


343
00:21:49.672 --> 00:21:51.841
<i>Man, she looked as if
she'd just been thrown off</i>


344
00:21:52.008 --> 00:21:53.676
<i>the crumbiest freight train
in the world.</i>


345
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:57.680
<i>Yet, in spite of this,
I got the impression of beauty.</i>


346
00:21:58.139 --> 00:22:00.475
<i>Not the beauty of a movie
actress, mind you,</i>


347
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:02.977
<i>or the beauty you dream about
when you're with your wife,</i>


348
00:22:03.144 --> 00:22:04.187
<i>but a natural beauty.</i>

349
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:07.106
<i>A beauty that's almost homely
because it's so real.</i>


350
00:22:09.192 --> 00:22:11.235
<i>Then suddenly she turned
to face me.</i>


351
00:22:11.402 --> 00:22:12.987
Vera: <i>How far
did you say we were going?</i>


352
00:22:13.321 --> 00:22:15.198
Los Angeles.
Where you coming from?


353
00:22:15.365 --> 00:22:16.366
<i>Oh, back there.</i>

354
00:22:16.532 --> 00:22:17.742
<i>- Needles?
- No.</i>


355
00:22:18.451 --> 00:22:19.827
<i>Oh, sure, Phoenix.</i>

356
00:22:19.994 --> 00:22:21.871
<i>You look just like</i>
a <i>Phoenix girl.</i>


357
00:22:22.038 --> 00:22:23.873
<i>Are the girls from Phoenix
that bad?</i>


358
00:22:24.165 --> 00:22:25.958
Al: <i>The girl
must've been pretty tired</i>


359
00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:27.168
<i>because she fell asleep</i>

360
00:22:27.335 --> 00:22:29.170
<i>not 20 minutes after
she stepped into the car.</i>


361
00:22:29.879 --> 00:22:33.925
<i>She lay sprawled out with her head
resting against the car door.</i>


362
00:22:34.634 --> 00:22:36.094
<i>I didn't like
that part of it much,</i>


363
00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.303
<i>but I didn't wake her up.</i>

364
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.848
<i>It wasn't that this girl
still worried me.</i>


365
00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:42.850
<i>I'd gotten over
that funny feeling I had</i>


366
00:22:43.017 --> 00:22:44.018
<i>when she looked at me.</i>

367
00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:46.104
<i>- Which I put down as just my--</i>
- (TV turns of)


368
00:22:48.773 --> 00:22:50.608
Vincent: <i>The cab 's booked
for just after 11:00.</i>


369
00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:54.654
<i>I love you more than anything
in the whole world.</i>


370
00:22:56.155 --> 00:22:57.407
<i>You are my world.</i>

371
00:23:01.494 --> 00:23:03.454
<i>Harper thinks
he's got something on me.</i>


372
00:23:03.746 --> 00:23:05.998
<i>I don't know what he thinks
he knows, but...</i>


373
00:23:06.874 --> 00:23:08.209
<i>you don't need to worry
about him.</i>


374
00:23:08.751 --> 00:23:09.752
<i>I'll take care of him.</i>

375
00:23:11.712 --> 00:23:15.133
You know, I imagine us
together real soon.


376
00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:18.136
And we're gonna be so happy.

377
00:23:19.178 --> 00:23:21.222
And all this misery
will be behind us.


378
00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:29.230
Johnny:
So, where's your old man at?


379
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.773
Harper: He's at the house.

380
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.191
He's still back there?

381
00:23:32.358 --> 00:23:34.026
Yeah, yeah.
His flight's not until later.


382
00:23:34.193 --> 00:23:35.945
He was about to leave when you
guys showed up.


383
00:23:36.112 --> 00:23:37.572
Where's he staying at when he
gets in?


384
00:23:37.738 --> 00:23:38.739
I got an address.

385
00:23:38.906 --> 00:23:39.949
You know, a job like this,

386
00:23:40.116 --> 00:23:41.534
I'm gonna need the money
up front.


387
00:23:42.034 --> 00:23:43.411
Yeah, that's no problem.

388
00:23:44.745 --> 00:23:46.038
Oh!

389
00:23:46.205 --> 00:23:48.499
Well, fuck me, she's alive!

390
00:23:48.624 --> 00:23:50.042
It's nice to have you back
with us.


391
00:23:50.209 --> 00:23:51.210
Fuck off, Johnny.

392
00:23:51.377 --> 00:23:53.254
- What was that?
- You heard me.


393
00:23:54.964 --> 00:23:57.175
Don't hit me.
Don't you fucking hit me!


394
00:23:57.341 --> 00:23:58.468
Fucking..

395
00:23:58.634 --> 00:24:00.761
- Stop, stop, stop!
- You say something?


396
00:24:02.472 --> 00:24:04.015
Huh?

397
00:24:04.182 --> 00:24:05.808
You don't have to be physical.

398
00:24:05.975 --> 00:24:08.478
Like that? What,
are you her guardian angel,


399
00:24:08.603 --> 00:24:09.812
or do you wanna fuck her?

400
00:24:09.979 --> 00:24:10.980
No, of course not.

401
00:24:11.147 --> 00:24:12.857
- What, you think she's ugly?
- No.


402
00:24:13.024 --> 00:24:14.192
She's your girl.

403
00:24:14.358 --> 00:24:15.943
Yeah well,
what if she wasn't my girl?


404
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.612
- Johnny!
- Would you fuck her then?


405
00:24:17.778 --> 00:24:19.363
No, come on,
what if she wasn't my girl?


406
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.908
- Would you fuck her then?
- But she is your girl.


407
00:24:22.074 --> 00:24:24.035
Yeah, but, motherfucker,
what if she wasn't?


408
00:24:24.202 --> 00:24:26.037
Come on, it's a straight
fucking question!


409
00:24:26.204 --> 00:24:27.663
I want a straight
fucking answer!


410
00:24:27.955 --> 00:24:30.124
Everything has its price,
you little shit!


411
00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:32.084
Would you fuck her, yes or no?

412
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.628
Yes or no?

413
00:24:33.794 --> 00:24:34.795
Huh?

414
00:24:34.962 --> 00:24:36.297
If she wasn't your girl,
then yes.


415
00:24:36.464 --> 00:24:37.798
Yes, I think she's very pretty.

416
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.389
Yeah, then you're very lucky,
because she's not my girl.


417
00:24:46.057 --> 00:24:47.475
She's a fucking whore.

418
00:24:48.726 --> 00:24:50.394
Anti-social fucking whore

419
00:24:50.561 --> 00:24:52.396
who needs to cheer
her country ass up.


420
00:24:52.563 --> 00:24:54.524
Recognize who her
fucking friends are!


421
00:25:08.246 --> 00:25:09.705
(engine revving)

422
00:25:28.474 --> 00:25:29.475
Miss.

423
00:25:29.725 --> 00:25:31.686
Where's the shithole
in this shithole?


424
00:25:39.986 --> 00:25:41.028
Hey. Are you okay?

425
00:25:41.779 --> 00:25:42.947
What are you doing?

426
00:25:43.406 --> 00:25:45.241
- What do you mean?
- Why are you here?


427
00:25:46.325 --> 00:25:48.578
- You know why I'm here.
- I know what Johnny told me.


428
00:25:48.911 --> 00:25:50.997
- Yeah.
- You're not the killing type.


429
00:25:52.582 --> 00:25:53.874
Is there a killing type?

430
00:25:54.041 --> 00:25:55.418
Yeah, and it ain't you.

431
00:26:03.676 --> 00:26:05.469
(snorts, sighs)

432
00:26:07.179 --> 00:26:08.598
Cherry:
Listen, you want some advice?


433
00:26:08.764 --> 00:26:10.725
Get on that bus
and go wherever it's going


434
00:26:10.891 --> 00:26:12.393
and have your boring,
miserable life


435
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.312
because I can guarantee
it'll be a whole lot better


436
00:26:14.437 --> 00:26:15.605
than being in debt to Johnny.

437
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:17.607
I'm not gonna be in debt
because I'm gonna pay him.


438
00:26:17.773 --> 00:26:20.067
What do you think happens when
Johnny's running low on cash?


439
00:26:20.234 --> 00:26:22.194
"Hey, Harper, hey,
my car broke down


440
00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:23.779
I'm gonna need
a little extra cash."


441
00:26:23.946 --> 00:26:24.947
Well, then I'll say no.

442
00:26:25.114 --> 00:26:27.199
And he'll politely remind you
one phone call from him


443
00:26:27.366 --> 00:26:28.743
you're going straight to jail.

444
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:30.119
Yeah, and so is he.

445
00:26:30.286 --> 00:26:33.289
No, no, 'cause you see Johnny
can call 20 maniacs in prison,


446
00:26:33.456 --> 00:26:35.124
all doing life without parole,

447
00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:36.500
who, for a case of cigarettes,

448
00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:39.253
will say they killed your step dad,
and you paid them to do it.


449
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.631
He's an expert
on shit like that.


450
00:26:43.507 --> 00:26:46.510
So that's why you're with him,
because he's blackmailing you?


451
00:26:46.677 --> 00:26:48.471
I heard him talking
about your face.


452
00:26:50.222 --> 00:26:51.557
He said you shot someone.

453
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:04.195
- (moaning)
- Yeah.


454
00:27:04.362 --> 00:27:05.363
<i>Fuck me good!</i>

455
00:27:06.155 --> 00:27:07.156
(woman moans)

456
00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:11.202
(cell phone ringing)

457
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.121
Hello?

458
00:27:14.288 --> 00:27:15.623
Harper:
Hey, man, what you doing?


459
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.791
Masturbating.

460
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.835
<i>Hey, man, I got the fear about
this whole hormone thing,</i>


461
00:27:20.002 --> 00:27:22.171
so I've been surfing the
gay sites, see if I've turned.


462
00:27:22.338 --> 00:27:24.590
They got some crazy shit
on here, man.


463
00:27:24.757 --> 00:27:28.010
Terrifying stuff. Gay gangers,
fucking orgies, muscle Marys.


464
00:27:28.177 --> 00:27:30.805
<i>They even got this genre called
"The straight guys first time".</i>


465
00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:32.223
<i>I tried that. Nothing.</i>

466
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.809
Toys, twinks, studs,
not a twinge.


467
00:27:34.975 --> 00:27:36.644
And then I put the straight porn
back on...


468
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:37.895
Boom! I'm back, baby!

469
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.397
I got more wood
than a lumberjack.


470
00:27:39.689 --> 00:27:40.856
How's your mom?

471
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.984
The same. Thanks for asking.
Listen, um...


472
00:27:45.027 --> 00:27:47.655
- I need that favor.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for it.


473
00:27:47.822 --> 00:27:49.782
<i>All right,
so I need to get some weed.</i>


474
00:27:49.949 --> 00:27:51.117
Wait, you wanna buy weed?

475
00:27:51.283 --> 00:27:53.869
<i>Yeah, I wanna buy a lot of weed,
but you can't ask me why.</i>


476
00:27:54.078 --> 00:27:55.329
- Why?
- Paul.


477
00:27:55.496 --> 00:27:57.707
<i>- Is it for your mom?</i>
- What? No.


478
00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.041
Medicinal?

479
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.626
No, my mom's in a fucking coma!

480
00:28:00.793 --> 00:28:02.294
How is she supposed
to smoke weed?


481
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.839
You're right, dude.
That was dumb.


482
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.717
So, how much you need?

483
00:28:07.883 --> 00:28:09.719
<i>I need enough
that if you were caught with it</i>


484
00:28:09.885 --> 00:28:12.012
<i>there's no way it could be
construed as personal use.</i>


485
00:28:13.305 --> 00:28:14.348
What's going on?

486
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.183
I told you not to ask.

487
00:28:16.308 --> 00:28:18.352
Come on, man,
I broke up mid-whack for this.


488
00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:19.562
Break your vow of silence.

489
00:28:20.104 --> 00:28:21.439
Vincent's going to Vegas later,

490
00:28:21.605 --> 00:28:23.816
and he's going to run into some
problems at the airport.


491
00:28:23.983 --> 00:28:25.818
Yeah, I'm into that.

492
00:28:25.985 --> 00:28:27.111
<i>All right. Cool, man.</i>

493
00:28:27.278 --> 00:28:29.071
All right. Thanks. Bye.

494
00:28:34.535 --> 00:28:38.205
(shower running)

495
00:29:15.618 --> 00:29:17.244
(opens drawer)

496
00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:34.887
Hey, what can I get you?

497
00:29:35.054 --> 00:29:37.932
Two beers,
a sparkling water for the lady


498
00:29:38.098 --> 00:29:39.683
and get the boy a milkshake.

499
00:29:40.476 --> 00:29:41.602
Waitress: And what flavor?

500
00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:42.770
Banana.

501
00:29:48.776 --> 00:29:50.069
Have we met before?

502
00:29:50.945 --> 00:29:52.696
I don't think so.

503
00:29:53.447 --> 00:29:54.782
You were in my class
at Fairpoint.


504
00:29:54.949 --> 00:29:57.117
I'm Claire Wiseman, remember?

505
00:29:57.743 --> 00:30:00.162
Ah, yeah. I remember.

506
00:30:00.329 --> 00:30:01.539
How are you?

507
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:04.375
I'm good.
Wow, it's so good to see you.


508
00:30:04.542 --> 00:30:06.252
What have you been doing
these days?


509
00:30:06.418 --> 00:30:07.878
Oh, this and that.

510
00:30:08.045 --> 00:30:09.463
What happened to your face?

511
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.216
I was in a car crash.

512
00:30:12.424 --> 00:30:13.592
Waitress: I'm sorry.

513
00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:15.302
You're still as pretty as ever,
though.


514
00:30:15.469 --> 00:30:16.470
Thank you.

515
00:30:16.637 --> 00:30:18.347
Why don't you tell
your donut rubber friend


516
00:30:18.514 --> 00:30:20.432
- what you do for a living?
- Come on, man.


517
00:30:22.518 --> 00:30:23.894
She's a singer.

518
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:25.980
She's got a great voice.
Ain't that right?


519
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.982
You know, come to think of it,

520
00:30:28.148 --> 00:30:29.692
I remember you singing
at school.


521
00:30:29.859 --> 00:30:32.278
You were good.
Where do you sing at now?


522
00:30:32.444 --> 00:30:34.488
- I sometimes sing at--
- Vegas.


523
00:30:34.655 --> 00:30:36.407
Good for you!
Is that where you're headed?


524
00:30:36.574 --> 00:30:37.575
Yes, we are.

525
00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:39.785
- Wow, I wish I could come with.
- Well, you can't.


526
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.705
So why don't you jog
that cream pie ass along,


527
00:30:42.872 --> 00:30:44.123
put our order in?

528
00:30:45.749 --> 00:30:48.836
I guess I will.
I'll catch you in a minute.


529
00:30:50.796 --> 00:30:53.007
You thought I was gonna tell her
you was a trick?


530
00:30:53.173 --> 00:30:54.758
- I'm not a trick.
- He don't care.


531
00:30:54.925 --> 00:30:55.926
I do.

532
00:31:06.937 --> 00:31:08.022
You're not a trick.

533
00:31:13.485 --> 00:31:15.237
Don't you gotta go make
that call?


534
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:18.616
Yeah.

535
00:31:30.628 --> 00:31:31.921
You wanna keep this going?

536
00:31:34.131 --> 00:31:35.591
It's getting tiring, you know?

537
00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:37.927
You keep staring
in that rear view mirror,


538
00:31:38.093 --> 00:31:39.219
you're gonna crash.

539
00:31:41.263 --> 00:31:42.848
The fuck is wrong with you?

540
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.558
I swear to God,

541
00:31:44.767 --> 00:31:47.269
you've been body-snatched
or something.


542
00:31:47.603 --> 00:31:48.604
Alien.

543
00:31:50.898 --> 00:31:52.191
What do you want from me?

544
00:31:52.358 --> 00:31:53.901
I warned you I was crazy,

545
00:31:54.068 --> 00:31:55.694
but you was all,
"Don't worry, baby,


546
00:31:55.861 --> 00:31:56.862
I like crazy."

547
00:31:59.782 --> 00:32:00.908
Where's that girl?

548
00:32:04.954 --> 00:32:06.664
That girl was 16 years old.

549
00:32:19.259 --> 00:32:22.346
Hi. Can I get Dr. Ulmer, please?
It's Harper James.


550
00:32:22.513 --> 00:32:23.973
<i>- I'll just connect you.</i>
- Thank you.


551
00:32:25.265 --> 00:32:27.810
Dr. Ulmer: <i>Harper.
I was just about to call you.</i>


552
00:32:27.977 --> 00:32:29.269
How are things?

553
00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.772
<i>I was hoping I can see you
in person.</i>


554
00:32:31.939 --> 00:32:33.107
Just tell me.

555
00:32:35.275 --> 00:32:37.111
<i>The second set of results
came back,</i>


556
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.990
<i>and, I'm afraid to say,
there's no brain function.</i>


557
00:32:44.118 --> 00:32:45.828
<i>I really am very sorry.</i>

558
00:32:47.997 --> 00:32:49.623
<i>You have to take comfort
in the fact</i>


559
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.792
<i>that you did everything
you could for her.</i>


560
00:32:52.334 --> 00:32:54.503
<i>You were by her side
the whole time.</i>


561
00:32:55.504 --> 00:32:57.840
<i>Some people never experience
that kind of love.</i>


562
00:32:59.133 --> 00:33:01.135
<i>As doctors,
we realize pretty soon</i>


563
00:33:01.301 --> 00:33:02.720
<i>that we can't save everyone,</i>

564
00:33:03.721 --> 00:33:05.431
<i>but we have to try.</i>

565
00:33:07.057 --> 00:33:09.184
<i>You couldn't have done
much more for her.</i>


566
00:33:12.688 --> 00:33:15.065
<i>We don't have to make any
decisions right now, just...</i>


567
00:33:15.566 --> 00:33:17.609
<i>I think you should just come
by the office</i>


568
00:33:17.776 --> 00:33:18.861
<i>and we could have a talk.</i>

569
00:33:20.821 --> 00:33:22.740
<i>Harper? Are you there?</i>

570
00:33:26.243 --> 00:33:27.411
<i>Harper?</i>

571
00:33:31.123 --> 00:33:32.958
- Ma'am.
- Hi.


572
00:33:43.385 --> 00:33:46.680
- Hey, Claire.
- Hey, Mikey, what can I get you?


573
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:50.642
Make it
a cheese and mustard bagel,


574
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:53.562
coffee, and give me some juice
with that.


575
00:33:53.812 --> 00:33:55.814
- Okay. You got it.
- How's Pete?


576
00:33:55.981 --> 00:33:58.025
Oh, the same, you know.
He asked about you.


577
00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.693
- Said you'd been sick?
- Yeah.


578
00:33:59.902 --> 00:34:02.112
I had that bug that was
going around, everybody had.


579
00:34:02.321 --> 00:34:04.281
You look better.
I'm gonna put your order in.


580
00:34:04.448 --> 00:34:05.532
Yeah, thanks.

581
00:34:13.207 --> 00:34:16.418
(indistinct speech
over police radio)


582
00:34:22.424 --> 00:34:24.093
Hey, do you think that cop's
all right?


583
00:34:24.384 --> 00:34:26.345
No, I think that
that cop's an asshole,


584
00:34:26.512 --> 00:34:28.555
but we didn't do nothing wrong,
so relax.


585
00:34:29.515 --> 00:34:31.809
We gotta make a detour.
We gotta go see Frank.


586
00:34:31.934 --> 00:34:32.768
Why?

587
00:34:32.893 --> 00:34:34.770
Because we can't go to Nevada
without seeing Frank.


588
00:34:34.937 --> 00:34:35.854
Yes, we can.

589
00:34:36.063 --> 00:34:37.940
We pass through Nevada without
seeing Frank,


590
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.983
Frank finds out,
there'll be drama.


591
00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.528
- We don't need no drama.
- Who's this Frank guy?


592
00:34:42.694 --> 00:34:44.655
- He's a friend of ours.
- (chuckles) Yeah, right.


593
00:34:44.822 --> 00:34:45.989
Frank is...

594
00:34:48.617 --> 00:34:49.660
Put it this way,

595
00:34:49.827 --> 00:34:51.578
last time we was going
to Nevada,


596
00:34:51.745 --> 00:34:53.205
Cherry was sitting on
a kilo of blow.


597
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.249
She had it tucked away,
if you know what I mean.


598
00:34:55.374 --> 00:34:57.084
Most of it was in my bra.

599
00:34:57.251 --> 00:34:59.253
We were stopped what,
five times?


600
00:34:59.419 --> 00:35:00.587
At least five times.

601
00:35:00.754 --> 00:35:02.506
But each time they didn't have
a cause for a search,


602
00:35:02.673 --> 00:35:03.757
so they just had to let us go.

603
00:35:03.924 --> 00:35:06.510
But on the fifth time,
they bring out this sniffer dog.


604
00:35:06.677 --> 00:35:07.761
This...
(imitates dog)


605
00:35:09.054 --> 00:35:11.014
I thought we was fucked
for sure,


606
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:13.600
but that dog,
he just walked on past.


607
00:35:13.767 --> 00:35:16.478
I'm thinking, "Damn, Cherry must
have that shit packed tight."


608
00:35:16.687 --> 00:35:18.063
Anyway,

609
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.316
we get to Frank's, and it turns
out we ain't smuggling coke.


610
00:35:21.483 --> 00:35:23.110
We're smuggling baking powder.

611
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:27.030
The whole K is jack.
The spic dealer fucked us.


612
00:35:27.197 --> 00:35:29.241
We ain't sure whether
to laugh or cry.


613
00:35:29.449 --> 00:35:31.577
If it was flake,
we would've gotten 20 years.


614
00:35:31.743 --> 00:35:32.744
- Federal.
- Wait,


615
00:35:32.911 --> 00:35:34.621
So you didn't check it
before you bought it?


616
00:35:34.788 --> 00:35:36.748
It was Frank's guy.
I didn't have to.


617
00:35:36.915 --> 00:35:38.375
So, what happened?

618
00:35:38.876 --> 00:35:39.751
When?

619
00:35:39.918 --> 00:35:42.379
Wasn't this Frank guy angry
that you gave him fake drugs?


620
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.506
Like I said,
Frank's a friend of mine.


621
00:35:50.345 --> 00:35:52.389
- Here's your check.
- I didn't ask for no check.


622
00:35:57.102 --> 00:35:58.312
Thank you.

623
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.651
All right.

624
00:36:05.068 --> 00:36:06.904
What you're seeing here
is video evidence,


625
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.448
proof, that Vincent Reed,
my mother's second husband,


626
00:36:09.615 --> 00:36:10.908
somehow managed to convince her

627
00:36:11.074 --> 00:36:12.367
to sign over control
of the house,


628
00:36:12.534 --> 00:36:14.369
in the event of her death
or incapacity.


629
00:36:15.329 --> 00:36:18.457
This in spite, on the date that
she allegedly signed, right here,


630
00:36:18.624 --> 00:36:19.958
she was in New York with me.

631
00:36:20.167 --> 00:36:21.877
Look, I have our
air tickets here.


632
00:36:22.044 --> 00:36:24.254
And here's a photo of the two
of us on the Brooklyn Bridge.


633
00:36:24.421 --> 00:36:25.839
- Vincent: Harper! Harper!
- Note the date.


634
00:36:27.049 --> 00:36:28.050
Shit.

635
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.309
<i>Harper, get over here now!
Move your ass!</i>


636
00:36:39.478 --> 00:36:40.562
What?

637
00:36:41.396 --> 00:36:43.941
You get over here. What is this?

638
00:36:44.983 --> 00:36:46.818
- It's a knife.
- I know that, smartass!


639
00:36:46.985 --> 00:36:48.362
What's it doing
in my hand luggage?


640
00:36:48.528 --> 00:36:49.947
- I have no idea.
- You put it there.


641
00:36:50.072 --> 00:36:51.531
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know why.


642
00:36:51.698 --> 00:36:53.700
To make me look like shit
at the airport, probably.


643
00:36:53.867 --> 00:36:55.202
Oh, yeah.
That's right. I forgot.


644
00:36:55.369 --> 00:36:57.079
You're going on a business trip.

645
00:36:57.246 --> 00:36:59.498
A business trip to go survey
the Davis Casino extension.


646
00:36:59.665 --> 00:37:01.458
Except for the fact
that the Davis Casino


647
00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:03.919
- isn't having an extension.
- It's not an extension!


648
00:37:04.086 --> 00:37:05.754
We're developing
apartment blocks!


649
00:37:05.837 --> 00:37:07.297
You're a liar.
You're a fucking liar!


650
00:37:07.422 --> 00:37:09.216
Everything that's coming out of
your mouth is bullshit!


651
00:37:09.341 --> 00:37:10.509
All right, buddy.

652
00:37:10.676 --> 00:37:13.387
Why don't you tell me what it is
that you think you know?


653
00:37:14.805 --> 00:37:17.766
You forged my mother's signature
on her will, yeah.


654
00:37:17.933 --> 00:37:19.893
And you did a pretty good job
of it, Vince,


655
00:37:20.102 --> 00:37:22.729
except for the fact
that she was with me in New York


656
00:37:22.896 --> 00:37:24.606
on the date that she was
supposed to have signed!


657
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:25.691
And guess what?

658
00:37:25.774 --> 00:37:27.693
That's not gonna hold up
in court, buddy.


659
00:37:30.529 --> 00:37:33.282
I... I forged her signature

660
00:37:33.448 --> 00:37:35.200
so that you would get your money

661
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.078
without having to go through
five years of litigation,


662
00:37:38.203 --> 00:37:40.497
- if we get bad new today.
- So you did forge it.


663
00:37:40.664 --> 00:37:41.873
So what?

664
00:37:42.249 --> 00:37:43.959
Oh, but it was all for me,
right, Vince?


665
00:37:44.084 --> 00:37:45.168
In a way, yeah.

666
00:37:45.711 --> 00:37:48.630
Good. Are you fucking the
cocktail waitress for me, too?


667
00:37:49.631 --> 00:37:50.757
What are you talking about?

668
00:37:50.924 --> 00:37:53.844
I'm not stupid, Vince!
I know about Rosy Hills.


669
00:37:54.052 --> 00:37:58.265
Rosy Hills? (chuckles)
Yeah, yeah, you are right!


670
00:37:58.432 --> 00:38:00.183
I am fucking Rosy Hills

671
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.394
while your mother lies dying
in a coma!


672
00:38:02.561 --> 00:38:03.770
But that's not even all.

673
00:38:03.895 --> 00:38:04.855
- No?
- No.


674
00:38:05.022 --> 00:38:07.733
I think you were driving the car
when the accident happened!


675
00:38:07.858 --> 00:38:09.192
You wanted her to die!

676
00:38:09.568 --> 00:38:10.861
How fucking dare you?

677
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.820
Get--

678
00:38:12.279 --> 00:38:14.072
What the fuck is the matter
with you! Fuck!


679
00:38:14.323 --> 00:38:15.741
(grunting)

680
00:38:22.497 --> 00:38:24.499
(audio cuts out)

681
00:38:58.658 --> 00:39:00.452
- (knife slices)
- (gasps)


682
00:39:05.791 --> 00:39:07.084
(grunting)

683
00:39:11.671 --> 00:39:12.964
(grunting)

684
00:39:13.757 --> 00:39:15.258
(groaning)

685
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.636
Harper.

686
00:39:32.692 --> 00:39:36.321
(siren wailing)

687
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.576
(siren wailing)

688
00:39:45.122 --> 00:39:46.790
Let me do the talking.

689
00:39:47.082 --> 00:39:48.375
Wait, you're not gonna stop,
are you?


690
00:39:48.583 --> 00:39:50.502
We didn't do nothing wrong,
all right?


691
00:39:50.669 --> 00:39:52.379
Don't speak, you understand me?

692
00:39:52.546 --> 00:39:54.005
Don't say a fucking word.

693
00:39:54.172 --> 00:39:57.384
(siren wailing)

694
00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:05.600
(siren chirps)

695
00:40:07.018 --> 00:40:08.603
Fucking shit.

696
00:40:10.188 --> 00:40:11.773
Dispatch: (over radio)
<i>57, go ahead.</i>


697
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.068
Control, Sierra Madre calling in here.
Officer Andrews.


698
00:40:15.652 --> 00:40:19.156
NV plates for a 1-2-3-1-9,
California plates.


699
00:40:19.865 --> 00:40:21.283
(car door opens)

700
00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:32.419
(snorts)

701
00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.258
Something wrong, Officer?

702
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.010
My gut says "yeah".

703
00:40:40.802 --> 00:40:42.554
You ran out the restaurant.

704
00:40:42.804 --> 00:40:44.306
You forgot this on the table.

705
00:40:45.849 --> 00:40:46.850
Yeah?

706
00:40:47.434 --> 00:40:48.393
Yeah.

707
00:40:48.727 --> 00:40:51.229
You know, I have no idea why
she wrote that.


708
00:40:52.063 --> 00:40:53.648
She is a waitress.

709
00:40:53.815 --> 00:40:56.067
She might've thought
it was part of the service.


710
00:40:56.234 --> 00:40:57.235
Don't matter, though.

711
00:40:57.402 --> 00:40:59.404
You've been hawking me through
your pig blinkers


712
00:40:59.571 --> 00:41:00.947
since I walked into that place.

713
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.284
The question is, why?

714
00:41:04.784 --> 00:41:06.244
Uniforms make me nervous.

715
00:41:06.453 --> 00:41:07.787
- Do they now?
- Yeah.


716
00:41:07.996 --> 00:41:09.998
I fought in Afghanistan,
got therapy.


717
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.000
- You's a vet, huh?
- Mm-hm.


718
00:41:12.459 --> 00:41:13.793
Huh. Small world.

719
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.921
I served, too, 2002.

720
00:41:16.213 --> 00:41:18.757
- Operation Anaconda.
- Your boys did a fine job.


721
00:41:18.965 --> 00:41:21.551
Why, thank you, sir.
What's the name of your mission?


722
00:41:21.718 --> 00:41:25.013
Oh, you know, we named it
Go Fuck Bin Laden.


723
00:41:25.847 --> 00:41:28.808
(laughing)

724
00:41:29.518 --> 00:41:30.519
Go...

725
00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.146
Go Fuck Bin Laden?

726
00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:36.650
Oh, man, I like that.
That's funny. That's funny.


727
00:41:36.942 --> 00:41:39.069
What's the real name
of your mission?


728
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.532
You know, I can't recall.

729
00:41:44.282 --> 00:41:45.408
Uh-huh.

730
00:41:50.872 --> 00:41:52.582
Would you please step out
of the vehicle?


731
00:41:52.832 --> 00:41:53.833
(car door opens)

732
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.962
Put your hands on the hood.

733
00:41:57.921 --> 00:42:00.674
- Come on, man.
- Put your hands on the hood!


734
00:42:02.592 --> 00:42:05.887
A soldier's mission
is scarred on his brain.


735
00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.474
You disrespectful piece of shit.

736
00:42:09.808 --> 00:42:11.309
You think you some kind of
war hero?


737
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.144
Open your legs! 
Open your legs!

738
00:42:19.442 --> 00:42:20.610
Okay.

739
00:42:21.236 --> 00:42:22.237
Okay.

740
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.948
What we have here?

741
00:42:25.907 --> 00:42:28.410
What's this, coke, meth, oxy?

742
00:42:28.702 --> 00:42:30.996
I know how you hillbilly boys
like that oxy.


743
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.790
No, no, no.
That's crushed Viagra.


744
00:42:34.249 --> 00:42:37.002
I'll need a shitload of it later
if I'm to fuck your wife.


745
00:42:38.545 --> 00:42:40.213
- You fuck!
- (groaning)


746
00:42:40.463 --> 00:42:42.215
(grunting)

747
00:42:42.757 --> 00:42:45.760
You wanna laugh now?
You, get out of the car!


748
00:42:46.094 --> 00:42:49.097
Get out of the car right now!
Get out of the vehicle!


749
00:42:49.264 --> 00:42:51.308
Get out of the vehicle now!
Put your hands in the air!


750
00:42:51.474 --> 00:42:53.476
Come on, move, Sister Mary!
Get over here!


751
00:42:53.643 --> 00:42:55.186
- Yes, sir.
- Put your hands on the hood.


752
00:42:55.353 --> 00:42:56.354
Yes, sir.

753
00:42:57.897 --> 00:42:59.566
- Do I gotta cuff you?
- No, sir.


754
00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:00.483
Good.

755
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:02.777
'Cause I only got cable ties,

756
00:43:02.944 --> 00:43:05.155
and I do not need another
police brutality charge.


757
00:43:05.322 --> 00:43:06.364
Yes, sir.

758
00:43:06.531 --> 00:43:08.199
Keep your eyes right here,
you hear me?


759
00:43:08.366 --> 00:43:10.368
Keep your eyes right here
and your hands on the hood!


760
00:43:10.535 --> 00:43:11.828
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir.


761
00:43:14.205 --> 00:43:16.082
- Stop crying.
- Yes, sir.


762
00:43:19.628 --> 00:43:20.670
How are you doing, Miss?

763
00:43:20.837 --> 00:43:21.921
Oh, I'm all right.

764
00:43:22.088 --> 00:43:23.089
Yeah?

765
00:43:23.256 --> 00:43:25.550
Getting your friends arrested
don't bother you none, huh?


766
00:43:25.717 --> 00:43:27.844
They ain't technically
my friends, Officer.


767
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:29.763
They hired me for the day.

768
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:34.309
- You a hooker?
- I'm a dancer.


769
00:43:36.519 --> 00:43:38.980
Prostitution's legal in Nevada,
but this ain't Nevada.


770
00:43:39.147 --> 00:43:41.066
I ain't fucked them yet,
neither.


771
00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:42.942
Yeah, can't blame you.

772
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:44.110
(Cherry chuckles)

773
00:43:44.277 --> 00:43:45.737
I need you come up
out of this car,


774
00:43:45.904 --> 00:43:47.739
give me a little tour around.
That all right?


775
00:43:47.947 --> 00:43:49.240
- Sure.
- All right.


776
00:43:52.786 --> 00:43:54.704
You can start by popping
the trunk, that all right?


777
00:43:54.913 --> 00:43:56.289
- Sure.
- All right.


778
00:43:56.706 --> 00:43:57.999
(car door closes)

779
00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.215
Keep your eyes on me!

780
00:44:05.465 --> 00:44:06.675
Yes, sir.

781
00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:16.976
- Jesus Christ.
- Drop the gun!


782
00:44:17.769 --> 00:44:19.646
You're making a mistake, ma'am!
Making a big mistake!


783
00:44:19.813 --> 00:44:21.523
You heard me, asshole,
drop the fucking gun!


784
00:44:21.648 --> 00:44:23.024
- Shoot the prick!
- No!


785
00:44:23.191 --> 00:44:24.693
- Kill him!
- Do not kill him!


786
00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:27.404
No, no, listen to him!
Don't kill me, ma'am! Please!


787
00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.240
- Drop the fucking gun!
- Okay! Right there, lady, all right?


788
00:44:30.365 --> 00:44:31.908
Please! I got a wife and kid!

789
00:44:32.075 --> 00:44:34.119
- I just wanna go home!
- Drop the keys for the handcuffs.


790
00:44:34.285 --> 00:44:36.329
Take the keys and go, all right?
Just take the keys.


791
00:44:36.621 --> 00:44:38.581
Right there. All right?

792
00:44:38.748 --> 00:44:40.667
Look, I got a wife and kids
at home.


793
00:44:40.834 --> 00:44:42.293
I just want to go home. Okay?

794
00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.546
(radio beeps)
(dispatch over radio)


795
00:44:44.713 --> 00:44:47.048
- Give me that fucking radio!
- (radio chirps)


796
00:44:47.382 --> 00:44:48.675
Here, you can have these.

797
00:44:48.842 --> 00:44:50.343
I just don't want any trouble.

798
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:52.470
- Just put the gun away.
- Get in the trunk.


799
00:44:53.847 --> 00:44:55.598
No, I'm not getting
in that trunk.


800
00:44:55.765 --> 00:44:56.766
Get in the fucking trunk.

801
00:44:58.393 --> 00:45:00.311
(shouts)
Get in the fucking trunk!


802
00:45:09.654 --> 00:45:11.364
- Get in the trunk!
- Okay!


803
00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:24.836
(panting)

804
00:45:37.182 --> 00:45:38.183
Okay.

805
00:45:38.683 --> 00:45:40.977
Pull it together, Harper.
Come on.


806
00:45:41.144 --> 00:45:42.854
Keep it together.
Keep yourself together.


807
00:45:43.396 --> 00:45:45.815
(breathes heavily)

808
00:45:45.982 --> 00:45:47.650
You're not the kind of guy
who folds.


809
00:45:49.444 --> 00:45:50.695
This is not the time to panic.

810
00:45:57.577 --> 00:45:58.787
He killed her.

811
00:45:59.412 --> 00:46:00.413
He killed your mother.

812
00:47:11.568 --> 00:47:13.111
Mr. Parfitt: Hey, Harper!

813
00:47:14.779 --> 00:47:15.905
Everything okay?

814
00:47:16.072 --> 00:47:17.198
Uh: yeah!

815
00:47:17.782 --> 00:47:19.117
Mr. Parfitt:
Nice day for a swim.


816
00:47:19.284 --> 00:47:20.159
Yeah.

817
00:47:20.952 --> 00:47:23.538
Listen, I can clear those leaves
for you, if you like.


818
00:47:23.913 --> 00:47:25.373
You've enough to worry about.

819
00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.626
No. No...
I like the distraction.


820
00:47:29.502 --> 00:47:30.503
Okay.

821
00:48:19.761 --> 00:48:21.220
(sobs)

822
00:48:21.804 --> 00:48:23.681
(car engine starts up)

823
00:49:49.267 --> 00:49:50.476
Fuck.

824
00:50:00.945 --> 00:50:03.489
(tape unravels)

825
00:50:18.463 --> 00:50:20.923
(cell phone ringing)

826
00:50:30.725 --> 00:50:32.101
(cell phone chimes)

827
00:50:38.399 --> 00:50:40.693
Voicemail:
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>


828
00:50:40.818 --> 00:50:41.652
(beeps)

829
00:50:41.778 --> 00:50:44.197
<i>Hey, Harper, it's Paul. I got
that little something for you.</i>


830
00:50:44.363 --> 00:50:45.656
<i>I'm on my way around.</i>

831
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:47.450
No, no, no, no. Fuck!

832
00:50:47.617 --> 00:50:49.035
(line ringing)

833
00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.497
- (cell phone beeps)
- Hey, Paul.


834
00:50:52.663 --> 00:50:53.706
Hey, it's Harper.

835
00:50:53.873 --> 00:50:55.291
Listen, hey, whatever you do,

836
00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:57.543
you absolutely cannot
come over here right now.


837
00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:00.755
There's just been a...
Just don't come.


838
00:51:00.922 --> 00:51:02.173
Just don't come over.

839
00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.425
(doorbell chimes)

840
00:51:06.469 --> 00:51:07.470
Fuck.

841
00:51:21.192 --> 00:51:22.193
Fuck.

842
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:36.165
- Hey, Paul--
- What's up, buddy?


843
00:51:36.415 --> 00:51:38.292
Wait, you can't go in there.

844
00:51:38.459 --> 00:51:39.460
Why?

845
00:51:39.627 --> 00:51:41.003
You just can't. Come here.

846
00:51:41.504 --> 00:51:42.630
What's going on?

847
00:51:43.673 --> 00:51:44.841
Uh...

848
00:51:45.133 --> 00:51:47.885
- My step dad's in there.
- Oh, shit. Okay.


849
00:51:48.052 --> 00:51:49.470
Do you still want the weed?

850
00:51:49.637 --> 00:51:52.348
Uh... Yeah, yeah. I'll take it.

851
00:51:52.515 --> 00:51:54.559
Okay, well there was
a slight problem with the weed.


852
00:51:54.725 --> 00:51:57.145
Do you remember the mine shafts
we visited when we were kids?


853
00:51:57.311 --> 00:51:59.105
Do you remember Reece
got lost for three days?


854
00:51:59.272 --> 00:52:01.858
They got this Tree of Love
music festival there now.


855
00:52:02.024 --> 00:52:04.485
Imagine if one of them stoners
gets lost in them tunnels, dude.


856
00:52:04.652 --> 00:52:06.904
They're not gonna find that
fool's body for a hundred years.


857
00:52:10.199 --> 00:52:11.951
But anyway, that's why
I couldn't get any weed.


858
00:52:12.785 --> 00:52:14.996
It's all right. It's all right.
I'll take whatever you have.


859
00:52:15.204 --> 00:52:16.205
Harper.

860
00:52:16.497 --> 00:52:18.541
I've been on a wild goose chase
all morning, man.


861
00:52:18.708 --> 00:52:19.709
At least hear me out.

862
00:52:19.876 --> 00:52:21.419
Do you wanna grab a coffee
or something?


863
00:52:21.586 --> 00:52:22.587
I... You know what?

864
00:52:22.753 --> 00:52:23.838
I can't, man.

865
00:52:24.005 --> 00:52:26.841
I just really gotta go see
my mom in a minute.


866
00:52:27.008 --> 00:52:28.050
Shit, man. I'm sorry.

867
00:52:29.343 --> 00:52:30.553
Look, I couldn't get the weed,

868
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.972
but do you remember that stuff
that turned my hair white?


869
00:52:34.098 --> 00:52:36.017
Boom. Liquid acid.

870
00:52:37.143 --> 00:52:38.352
Schedule One drug.

871
00:52:38.519 --> 00:52:40.021
They find that on him, man,

872
00:52:40.188 --> 00:52:41.480
they're gonna
throw his ass away.


873
00:52:41.647 --> 00:52:43.399
However, if you're feeling
compassionate,


874
00:52:43.566 --> 00:52:45.860
or just fancy some fun
of the twisted variety,


875
00:52:46.027 --> 00:52:47.528
put some of that
in his eye drops.


876
00:52:47.695 --> 00:52:49.405
He'll wind up in an institution.

877
00:52:49.989 --> 00:52:51.782
All right. Thanks.

878
00:52:54.702 --> 00:52:57.663
- You okay, man?
- I'm fine. Fine.


879
00:52:59.332 --> 00:53:00.583
Hey, buddy.

880
00:53:03.586 --> 00:53:05.630
Dude, you know I love you, man,
and your mom.


881
00:53:06.547 --> 00:53:08.132
When you go visit her
at the hospital,


882
00:53:08.257 --> 00:53:09.675
give her a big hug for me, okay?

883
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.637
Hey, come here, buddy.
Come here.


884
00:53:15.056 --> 00:53:17.016
- It's gonna be okay, I promise.
- (sobs)


885
00:53:17.183 --> 00:53:19.560
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna call you later, okay?


886
00:53:21.812 --> 00:53:23.397
All right. Thanks, man.

887
00:53:27.235 --> 00:53:28.236
(engine revving)

888
00:53:28.402 --> 00:53:29.820
Johnny:
<i>We're gonna have to kill him</i>


889
00:53:29.987 --> 00:53:31.322
<i>and dump his body somewhere.</i>

890
00:53:31.489 --> 00:53:33.199
Harper: <i>Kill a fucking cop!
Are you crazy?</i>


891
00:53:33.324 --> 00:53:35.117
What do you wanna do,
just let him go?


892
00:53:35.284 --> 00:53:37.203
- Well, we're not gonna kill him!
- (knocking from trunk)


893
00:53:37.453 --> 00:53:39.705
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuck.

894
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.418
All right. All right.
I have something to admit.


895
00:53:44.585 --> 00:53:46.420
No, you have nothing to admit.

896
00:53:46.587 --> 00:53:48.339
Just trust Johnny.
He knows what he's doing.


897
00:53:48.506 --> 00:53:50.424
Admit? What the fuck
are you talking about?


898
00:53:51.259 --> 00:53:53.302
- Nothing.
- Say what you was gonna say.


899
00:53:56.264 --> 00:53:57.390
All right.

900
00:53:57.556 --> 00:53:58.599
I'm scared, okay?

901
00:53:58.766 --> 00:54:00.309
I admit that I'm scared.

902
00:54:03.896 --> 00:54:05.439
Feeling scared is normal,

903
00:54:05.606 --> 00:54:07.858
but don't be feeling bad
for no cop.


904
00:54:08.317 --> 00:54:11.612
You seen how he was acting up.
Some people deserve what they get.


905
00:54:12.947 --> 00:54:14.448
Well, there's gotta be
another way.


906
00:54:14.615 --> 00:54:17.451
- You don't have to kill him.
- Oh, I ain't gonna kill him.


907
00:54:17.743 --> 00:54:19.954
- You are.
- What?


908
00:54:20.121 --> 00:54:21.580
I gotta know which side
you're on.


909
00:54:22.206 --> 00:54:24.375
Now, I know that may seem tough,
but as you get older,


910
00:54:24.542 --> 00:54:27.295
you realize that life isn't
about the choice you make.


911
00:54:27.461 --> 00:54:28.504
It's the one you're given.

912
00:54:28.671 --> 00:54:31.173
You can't live in the past.
Ain't that right, Cherry?


913
00:54:31.799 --> 00:54:33.551
I said,
"Ain't that right, Cherry?"


914
00:54:33.718 --> 00:54:35.344
Yeah. That is right, Johnny.

915
00:54:35.511 --> 00:54:37.013
Yeah, that's right.

916
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.349
So the choice I'm giving you is,
kill the cop,


917
00:54:40.474 --> 00:54:42.143
then go to the bank
and get my money,


918
00:54:42.351 --> 00:54:44.437
or go to the bank, get my money,

919
00:54:44.729 --> 00:54:47.106
and then, well,
I think you got it.


920
00:54:49.608 --> 00:54:51.068
So, what's it gonna be?

921
00:54:54.864 --> 00:54:57.783
Cashier: 20,000 in this
envelope, five in that one.


922
00:55:02.121 --> 00:55:03.289
Anything else, sir?

923
00:55:05.541 --> 00:55:07.376
Have you lived here in Barstow
your whole life?


924
00:55:07.543 --> 00:55:09.128
- Yes, I have.
- Yeah?


925
00:55:09.295 --> 00:55:10.504
Do you like it here?

926
00:55:10.671 --> 00:55:12.798
- Not really.
- Why is that?


927
00:55:13.132 --> 00:55:14.258
Boring as hell.

928
00:55:15.343 --> 00:55:17.553
Johnny: What was you talking
about when we was in the diner?


929
00:55:17.928 --> 00:55:19.013
Cherry: When?

930
00:55:19.388 --> 00:55:20.389
What do you mean, "When"?

931
00:55:20.556 --> 00:55:22.850
When you was in the diner
and I was in the head.


932
00:55:23.476 --> 00:55:24.643
Nothing.

933
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:27.188
Your lips were moving.
Nothing was coming out.


934
00:55:28.022 --> 00:55:29.398
He asked if I was all right.

935
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:32.360
Why?

936
00:55:32.526 --> 00:55:33.819
'Cause you hit me.

937
00:55:38.866 --> 00:55:39.867
What did you tell him?

938
00:55:41.077 --> 00:55:42.411
I told him I was fine.

939
00:55:42.578 --> 00:55:44.622
- What else?
- Nothing else.


940
00:55:46.499 --> 00:55:49.543
I was gone a while.
You must have said something.


941
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:52.755
Nope.

942
00:55:56.801 --> 00:55:58.010
They only had five available.

943
00:55:58.177 --> 00:55:59.595
I'm giving you
the rest tonight in Vegas


944
00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.180
and I'll give you more
to buy the cop.


945
00:56:01.305 --> 00:56:02.556
Cop ain't for sale.

946
00:56:02.973 --> 00:56:04.433
You said everything
has its price.


947
00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:07.436
How much?

948
00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:11.357
If the cop lives,
I'll give you ten grand.


949
00:56:11.982 --> 00:56:13.150
I'm guessing you got a plan

950
00:56:13.401 --> 00:56:15.903
that don't involve me
spending a lifetime in prison.


951
00:56:16.695 --> 00:56:17.863
Yeah, I got a plan.

952
00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:19.490
Yeah?
You wanna tell me that plan?


953
00:56:19.657 --> 00:56:21.283
Yeah, there's a mine shaft
near here.


954
00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:22.660
Take me there, 
I'll show you.

955
00:56:23.744 --> 00:56:26.455
All right.
First we gotta go see Frank.


956
00:56:26.622 --> 00:56:27.915
(engine starts up)

957
00:56:52.356 --> 00:56:54.692
These guys find out
there's a cop in the trunk,


958
00:56:54.817 --> 00:56:57.445
they're gonna kill us all.
You make one fucking noise, pig,


959
00:56:57.611 --> 00:56:59.280
I'm gonna blast
your fucking head off.


960
00:57:05.161 --> 00:57:09.206
(vehicle approaching)

961
00:57:37.568 --> 00:57:38.569
Is he in?

962
00:57:38.736 --> 00:57:39.612
Yeah.

963
00:57:39.737 --> 00:57:41.071
What kind of mood?

964
00:57:41.655 --> 00:57:42.865
He's never in a good mood.

965
00:57:58.506 --> 00:58:01.592
Well, I got you all wrong,
didn't I?


966
00:58:03.886 --> 00:58:06.680
No. You got me just right.

967
00:58:06.847 --> 00:58:09.266
(footsteps approaching)

968
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:21.487
Hi, Cherry.

969
00:58:21.654 --> 00:58:22.696
Hi, Frank.

970
00:58:25.115 --> 00:58:26.784
I had a dream about you
last night.


971
00:58:26.951 --> 00:58:28.077
- Really.
- Yeah.


972
00:58:29.411 --> 00:58:30.871
It's so strange
that you're here.


973
00:58:33.499 --> 00:58:34.500
Hey...

974
00:58:35.876 --> 00:58:37.836
You mind if I give you
my number?


975
00:58:39.547 --> 00:58:40.548
My card?

976
00:58:40.714 --> 00:58:41.715
- Sure.
- Yeah.


977
00:58:41.882 --> 00:58:42.883
Is that all right?

978
00:58:44.134 --> 00:58:45.302
Wait-
- Wait a second.

979
00:58:47.513 --> 00:58:48.514
Pen.

980
00:58:53.936 --> 00:58:55.062
Call me, huh?

981
00:58:58.482 --> 00:59:00.317
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


982
00:59:01.485 --> 00:59:02.319
Mm.

983
00:59:18.043 --> 00:59:19.044
Frank: Ladies.

984
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:24.216
Hey, hey!

985
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.761
Hey, come here.

986
00:59:31.807 --> 00:59:33.309
Be awake
the next time I come in.


987
00:59:39.523 --> 00:59:40.357
Frank.

988
00:59:40.524 --> 00:59:41.525
What's going on?

989
00:59:42.067 --> 00:59:44.194
Cherry's sitting,
waiting in the car outside.


990
00:59:44.361 --> 00:59:46.071
You don't bring her in
to say hi?


991
00:59:46.614 --> 00:59:47.615
She's tired.

992
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:49.033
- Tired?
- Yeah.


993
00:59:49.199 --> 00:59:50.618
We're all fucking tired.

994
00:59:52.411 --> 00:59:54.580
- Who's the boy?
- A friend.


995
00:59:54.747 --> 00:59:55.748
What kind of friend?

996
00:59:55.914 --> 00:59:57.291
Kind that picks up the tab.

997
00:59:57.458 --> 00:59:58.876
Now that's five grand.

998
00:59:59.043 --> 01:00:00.544
I'll have the rest for you
by tomorrow.


999
01:00:00.711 --> 01:00:01.879
Why not today?

1000
01:00:02.087 --> 01:00:04.298
I got something going on
down in Vegas.


1001
01:00:06.091 --> 01:00:08.469
- You want a drink?
- Sure.


1002
01:00:13.557 --> 01:00:15.809
What did I say to you
the last time you were here?


1003
01:00:15.976 --> 01:00:17.728
You said don't come back
empty-handed!


1004
01:00:17.853 --> 01:00:20.564
Wrong! Lift your chin.
Stay still.


1005
01:00:21.315 --> 01:00:23.859
- (pants) Frank, please!
- Lift your chin up!


1006
01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:29.406
Didn't break. It doesn't count
because it didn't break.


1007
01:00:29.573 --> 01:00:31.450
- Frank, I'm gonna have your--
- Shut up!


1008
01:00:32.951 --> 01:00:34.244
You say one more word,

1009
01:00:34.411 --> 01:00:36.914
Ralph here'll put you in a box,
you understand?


1010
01:00:38.207 --> 01:00:39.375
(grunts)

1011
01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:40.542
Fuck!

1012
01:00:41.377 --> 01:00:42.378
My shoulder.

1013
01:00:43.003 --> 01:00:45.464
My shoulder.
I can't throw so hard anymore.


1014
01:00:46.757 --> 01:00:48.008
It's your lucky day, huh?

1015
01:00:56.558 --> 01:00:58.185
The last time you were here...

1016
01:00:59.395 --> 01:01:00.521
I said,

1017
01:01:00.688 --> 01:01:02.856
I would've preferred you have
come with nothing


1018
01:01:03.023 --> 01:01:04.316
than another excuse.

1019
01:01:05.067 --> 01:01:06.485
And what do you bring me?

1020
01:01:09.279 --> 01:01:13.701
I bought a kilogram
of baking powder from you...


1021
01:01:14.368 --> 01:01:15.661
and you're still breathing.

1022
01:01:17.287 --> 01:01:18.580
Why is that?

1023
01:01:19.707 --> 01:01:20.708
Why?

1024
01:01:20.874 --> 01:01:22.084
Why? Come on, come on.
Speak!


1025
01:01:22.251 --> 01:01:23.502
I know you've been good to me--

1026
01:01:23.669 --> 01:01:25.462
"Been good to me." Me-me-me.

1027
01:01:28.841 --> 01:01:30.134
You're a cretin, you know that?

1028
01:01:31.802 --> 01:01:33.137
You know what a cretin is?

1029
01:01:34.138 --> 01:01:37.433
A cretin's someone
who's brainless, childish,


1030
01:01:38.225 --> 01:01:39.476
lacks intelligence,

1031
01:01:39.893 --> 01:01:43.063
speaks nonsense that only
other cretins can understand.


1032
01:01:45.065 --> 01:01:47.860
You're busting your ass
with these repayments, why?


1033
01:01:48.485 --> 01:01:50.821
Because you have feelings
for this girl.


1034
01:01:50.988 --> 01:01:53.323
This girl that you treat
like a fucking whore.


1035
01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:56.410
And me! Me!
I have feelings for her, too!


1036
01:01:56.577 --> 01:01:59.872
But it seems I'm the only man
in the whole fucking world


1037
01:02:00.038 --> 01:02:01.957
who can't nail
that piece of ass!


1038
01:02:05.753 --> 01:02:06.754
So...

1039
01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.298
I'm gonna make you the same
offer I made you last time.


1040
01:02:10.674 --> 01:02:13.677
The girl stays here with me
and the debt is cleared.


1041
01:02:13.844 --> 01:02:15.846
You can even take
your five grand with you.


1042
01:02:19.892 --> 01:02:22.686
Cherry stays here,
and you can visit.


1043
01:02:29.902 --> 01:02:31.320
I can't do that.

1044
01:02:31.737 --> 01:02:32.905
Get your ass up.

1045
01:02:36.533 --> 01:02:37.534
There's one thing...

1046
01:02:39.411 --> 01:02:41.205
that my success
is based on...


1047
01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:43.874
and that's my word.

1048
01:02:45.334 --> 01:02:46.835
That's all I have.

1049
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:50.798
Tomorrow...

1050
01:02:52.007 --> 01:02:54.676
when the sun rises
over those hills,


1051
01:02:55.052 --> 01:02:59.223
if I don't see 50 grand
sitting across my desk,


1052
01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:01.934
I'm gonna come,
I'm gonna find Cherry,


1053
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.477
and I'm gonna sell her

1054
01:03:03.644 --> 01:03:06.480
to some bearded,
kneepad-wearing motherfucker


1055
01:03:06.647 --> 01:03:08.315
who will put her
in a tent somewhere


1056
01:03:08.482 --> 01:03:11.276
and use her as some kind of
hillbilly fuck mat!


1057
01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.739
Do I make myself
absolutely clear?


1058
01:03:20.285 --> 01:03:21.537
- Yeah!
- (whimpering)


1059
01:03:23.497 --> 01:03:26.124
Now get the fuck out of here.

1060
01:03:30.087 --> 01:03:31.421
- Ralph?
- Yes, boss.


1061
01:03:31.588 --> 01:03:33.841
Keep an eye on that degenerate.
Call our people in Vegas.


1062
01:03:34.633 --> 01:03:36.677
I don't want that cretin
running loose.

1065
01:04:44.912 --> 01:04:46.788

No. No, no, no.
God, no. I was--

01:06:50.579 --> 01:06:51.788
Everything okay?

1095
01:06:51.955 --> 01:06:53.874
Yeah, we're fine, Mr. Parfitt.
Thank you.


1096
01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:55.876
Okay, buddy.

1097
01:06:57.669 --> 01:07:00.672
I'm sorry,
but I made a mistake, okay?


1098
01:07:01.923 --> 01:07:04.134
- I apologize.
- I don't want fucking apologies,


1099
01:07:04.384 --> 01:07:07.429
What I want for you is to put your money
where big fucking mouth is.


1100
01:07:07.679 --> 01:07:08.722
I'm sorry.

1101
01:07:09.598 --> 01:07:11.308
Fucking walk away from me!

1102
01:07:22.486 --> 01:07:23.862
Paul: <i>Do you remember
the mine shafts</i>


1103
01:07:23.987 --> 01:07:25.155
<i>that we visited
when we were kids?</i>


1104
01:07:25.322 --> 01:07:26.865
<i>Remember Reece got lost
for three days?</i>


1105
01:07:27.199 --> 01:07:28.867
<i>They got this
music festival there now.</i>


1106
01:07:29.034 --> 01:07:31.453
<i>Imagine if one of them stoners
gets lost in them tunnels, dude.</i>


1107
01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.039
<i>They're not gonna find that
fool's body for a hundred years</i>


1108
01:07:35.999 --> 01:07:38.668
All right, you know what?
Let's do it, let's go.


1109
01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.131
Let's go to Vegas.
But let's take my dad's car.


1110
01:07:44.841 --> 01:07:46.009
Why?

1111
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:51.431
Why not?

1112
01:07:53.058 --> 01:07:54.017
(sounds horn)

1113
01:07:54.184 --> 01:07:56.645
Johnny: Get out of the way,
you fucking vegans!


1114
01:07:56.812 --> 01:07:58.772
Jesus fucking Christ!

1115
01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.982
What are you twirling,
a fucking stick?


1116
01:08:01.358 --> 01:08:02.692
(sounds horn)

1117
01:08:02.901 --> 01:08:05.362
Harper: Okay, this is where the
Anderson Shaft, is right here.


1118
01:08:09.908 --> 01:08:11.409
Pull over there
by the mine shaft.


1119
01:08:26.883 --> 01:08:27.884
What's the plan?

1120
01:08:28.885 --> 01:08:30.095
Pass me a bottle of water.

1121
01:08:32.806 --> 01:08:35.183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You ain't gonna just let this guy go.


1122
01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:36.893
He's probably dead
from dehydration.


1123
01:08:37.435 --> 01:08:38.436
And if he's not,

1124
01:08:38.854 --> 01:08:40.856
this is liquid acid, all right?

1125
01:08:41.022 --> 01:08:43.275
He's gonna be in the grip
of some serious hallucinations


1126
01:08:43.441 --> 01:08:44.442
for the next 48 hours.

1127
01:08:44.609 --> 01:08:46.403
He won't know fact from fiction
for a week,


1128
01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:48.446
let alone be a reliable witness
in court.


1129
01:08:50.407 --> 01:08:51.408
All right.

1130
01:08:51.783 --> 01:08:54.661
But if you can't tame
this piggy, I will.


1131
01:09:18.476 --> 01:09:20.353
Sir? Hello?

1132
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:23.148
I think he's dead.

1133
01:09:23.398 --> 01:09:24.816
(grunting, gasping)

1134
01:09:24.983 --> 01:09:26.693
- (cries out)
- Sir.


1135
01:09:26.902 --> 01:09:28.236
Sir! Sir!

1136
01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:30.572
Wait! Wait!
I'm trying to help you.


1137
01:09:30.822 --> 01:09:33.617
Here, drink this! Drink this!
It's water! It's water!


1138
01:09:44.961 --> 01:09:45.962
Wait!

1139
01:09:46.129 --> 01:09:47.130
Hey, go that way.

1140
01:09:48.131 --> 01:09:49.633
Towards the festival!

1141
01:10:18.245 --> 01:10:19.371
Let's go to Vegas.

1142
01:11:15.302 --> 01:11:18.054
Welcome to the casino, sir.
Is there any baggage in the trunk?


1143
01:11:18.221 --> 01:11:19.556
No. Nothing.

1144
01:11:19.848 --> 01:11:21.474
We ain't staying long.

1145
01:11:22.726 --> 01:11:23.727
No problem.

1146
01:11:34.571 --> 01:11:36.573
Two rooms. Big ones.

1147
01:11:36.865 --> 01:11:38.742
And put us down
at the comp rate.


1148
01:11:38.825 --> 01:11:40.452
I'm gonna need a credit card.

1149
01:11:44.205 --> 01:11:45.874
- Can I get a name?
- Peters.


1150
01:11:46.499 --> 01:11:47.584
Barney Peters.

1151
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.339
(typing)

1152
01:11:55.675 --> 01:11:57.552
Okay, Mr. Peters,
you're good to go.


1153
01:11:57.719 --> 01:11:59.721
Thank you. Thanks.

1154
01:12:03.308 --> 01:12:06.436
You go get my money,
then we find your old man.


1155
01:12:06.603 --> 01:12:09.314
And I got the keys, in case
you think about going anywhere.


1156
01:12:10.607 --> 01:12:11.691
What are you doing?

1157
01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:13.193
I'm gonna go to the room.

1158
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.820
Stay there.
I might need that ass.


1159
01:12:15.987 --> 01:12:17.197
(elevator dings)

1160
01:12:31.878 --> 01:12:33.338
I'm gonna rent a car...

1161
01:12:33.963 --> 01:12:35.423
and I'm gonna drive away.

1162
01:12:36.007 --> 01:12:37.342
And I'm gonna keep on driving.

1163
01:12:38.176 --> 01:12:40.804
And if you wanna come,
be outside the casino at 10:00.


1164
01:12:42.806 --> 01:12:43.807
(elevator dings)

1165
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:59.072
(casino games chiming)

1166
01:13:18.258 --> 01:13:19.676
Can I get light and a bourbon?

1167
01:13:28.268 --> 01:13:29.769
I'm guessing you're a winner.

1168
01:13:30.937 --> 01:13:31.938
In what regard?

1169
01:13:32.981 --> 01:13:34.691
In regard
to that stack of chips.


1170
01:13:36.568 --> 01:13:37.861
You think I gamble to win?

1171
01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:41.573
Then why?

1172
01:13:43.658 --> 01:13:45.326
Why do you think a boxer fights

1173
01:13:45.493 --> 01:13:47.370
when he's got more money
than he can ever spend?


1174
01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:49.622
'Cause he's stupid.

1175
01:13:49.789 --> 01:13:50.790
(man chuckles)

1176
01:13:51.666 --> 01:13:53.293
He does it to feel alive.

1177
01:13:54.085 --> 01:13:58.006
He'd rather risk it all
than be dead here or here.


1178
01:13:59.591 --> 01:14:00.675
To be really alive...

1179
01:14:01.551 --> 01:14:04.012
you gotta gamble more
than you can afford to lose.


1180
01:14:04.804 --> 01:14:09.058
You just gotta know how much...
or what that thing is.


1181
01:14:40.757 --> 01:14:42.217
Can I get a prepaid phone?

1182
01:15:14.374 --> 01:15:17.001
Hello, police? This is
the valet at The Collinen.


1183
01:15:17.168 --> 01:15:19.128
I was just taking a Mustang
down to the garage


1184
01:15:19.295 --> 01:15:21.673
and I accidentally
popped the trunk, and well...


1185
01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.133
there's something
you gotta see in here.


1186
01:15:25.426 --> 01:15:26.636
All right. Thanks.

1187
01:15:34.811 --> 01:15:36.271
Would you like extra insurance?

1188
01:15:36.437 --> 01:15:37.522
Uh, no, thanks.

1189
01:15:40.191 --> 01:15:41.317
Here you are.

1190
01:15:42.735 --> 01:15:44.988
Any vehicle from lot D.
Just show this at the gate.


1191
01:15:45.154 --> 01:15:46.155
Thank you.

1192
01:15:51.119 --> 01:15:52.245
(cell phone chimes)

1193
01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:40.168
(knocking on door)

1194
01:16:46.966 --> 01:16:48.384
- Going someplace?
- No.


1195
01:16:51.012 --> 01:16:53.514
Hi, sweetie.
Come on in.


1196
01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:23.628
Officer: Can I get an ID
on a blue Mustang?


1197
01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:47.944
Drive.

1198
01:17:54.283 --> 01:17:55.284
Harper: <i>What happened?</i>

1199
01:17:56.119 --> 01:17:57.120
Fucking asshole.

1200
01:17:58.162 --> 01:17:59.539
He brought a guy to my room.

1201
01:18:00.623 --> 01:18:02.792
Cops burst in,
arrested him for murder.


1202
01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:06.295
How did you get out?

1203
01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.589
They thought I was a hooker.

1204
01:18:19.976 --> 01:18:21.853
Johnny: Listen to me.
He's gonna kill her!


1205
01:18:22.019 --> 01:18:24.689
He's gonna kill--
He's gonna kill Cherry!


1206
01:18:24.856 --> 01:18:26.023
What are you talking about?

1207
01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:28.151
Frank Malone! If I don't get
Frank the money...


1208
01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:29.318
Get inside!

1209
01:18:29.485 --> 01:18:31.028
...he's gonna kill Cherry.

1210
01:18:32.238 --> 01:18:34.157
Please! Please!

1211
01:18:34.323 --> 01:18:36.868
You're allowed one phone call.
You want my advice?


1212
01:18:37.034 --> 01:18:38.536
Forget the girl
and call a lawyer.


1213
01:18:53.718 --> 01:18:55.136
I'll go see if they got a room.

1214
01:19:02.769 --> 01:19:04.771
I never killed the guy
who cut my face.


1215
01:19:05.438 --> 01:19:06.898
I mean, I shot him.

1216
01:19:07.857 --> 01:19:09.692
Me and Johnny, we dope guys.

1217
01:19:10.401 --> 01:19:13.237
I ain't proud of it,
but we bring guys back to the room,


1218
01:19:13.404 --> 01:19:16.282
guy falls asleep,
Johnny comes in, we rob him.


1219
01:19:17.784 --> 01:19:20.411
Except this time, the guy don't sleep
and Johnny don't show.


1220
01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:24.540
This asshole. He hit's me.

1221
01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.501
He's on top of me.

1222
01:19:26.667 --> 01:19:28.419
I'm fighting him,
screaming, crying...


1223
01:19:28.586 --> 01:19:29.754
And Johnny don't show.

1224
01:19:31.964 --> 01:19:33.257
This guy smashes a bottle
and says


1225
01:19:33.424 --> 01:19:35.802
it's either gonna be his cock
or the bottle inside of me.


1226
01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:40.014
I try to run, he cuts my face,

1227
01:19:40.181 --> 01:19:42.683
and I hear the sound of a gun,
and I'd shot him.


1228
01:19:46.187 --> 01:19:47.522
Then Johnny shows up.

1229
01:19:50.274 --> 01:19:51.484
That asshole would've lived,

1230
01:19:51.651 --> 01:19:53.402
but Johnny didn't drive him
to no hospital.


1231
01:19:53.569 --> 01:19:55.029
He took him to a storm drain.

1232
01:19:59.742 --> 01:20:00.743
What about you?

1233
01:20:02.787 --> 01:20:03.830
Why'd you kill him?

1234
01:20:15.132 --> 01:20:16.801
(cell phone ringing)

1235
01:20:29.564 --> 01:20:30.565
Johnny: <i>Cherry...</i>

1236
01:20:34.193 --> 01:20:35.486
<i>Frank's coming to get you.</i>

1237
01:20:37.697 --> 01:20:38.781
<i>I didn't wanna scare you.</i>

1238
01:20:43.035 --> 01:20:44.078
I just...

1239
01:21:07.018 --> 01:21:09.437
(exhaling)

1240
01:21:10.521 --> 01:21:11.522
Let's go.

1241
01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:34.128
(distorted feedback)

1242
01:21:49.268 --> 01:21:51.145
(birds chirping)

1243
01:22:02.198 --> 01:22:03.199
Ralph.

1244
01:22:04.116 --> 01:22:05.368
Go get my Cherry.

1245
01:22:16.253 --> 01:22:18.255
Cherry: <i>Why didn't you
just call a lawyer?</i>


1246
01:22:18.422 --> 01:22:20.132
Harper: <i>What,
instead of running to Mexico</i>


1247
01:22:20.341 --> 01:22:21.509
<i>like every other idiot?</i>

1248
01:22:22.969 --> 01:22:24.762
<i>- I panicked.</i>
- But there's still time.


1249
01:22:24.929 --> 01:22:27.598
You got money.
Hire a big-shot lawyer.


1250
01:22:27.932 --> 01:22:29.976
The only way a lawyer's
gonna keep me out of jail


1251
01:22:30.142 --> 01:22:32.603
is to get me to plead insanity,
then send me to a looney bin.


1252
01:22:33.312 --> 01:22:35.648
I'll be like McMurphy from
<i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>


1253
01:22:36.816 --> 01:22:37.984
Yeah.

1254
01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:39.652
Nurse Ratched will give me
a lobotomy.


1255
01:22:39.819 --> 01:22:43.072
(giggles)
All right, Mr. Doom and Gloom.


1256
01:22:43.239 --> 01:22:44.782
Well, I've seen that movie.

1257
01:22:44.949 --> 01:22:45.950
The Chief gets away.

1258
01:22:46.117 --> 01:22:48.953
So it's kind of a happy ending,
at least for one of them.


1259
01:22:54.542 --> 01:22:56.544
- You wanna get a soda?
- Sure.


1260
01:23:41.005 --> 01:23:43.799
(cash register beeps)

1261
01:23:49.972 --> 01:23:51.432
That's $5.48, please.

1262
01:24:06.739 --> 01:24:07.740
(knocks)

1263
01:24:09.825 --> 01:24:10.868
What are you doing?

1264
01:24:11.035 --> 01:24:12.161
I want you to take the money.

1265
01:24:12.328 --> 01:24:14.955
I don't want the money.
I wanna go to Mexico with you.


1266
01:24:15.331 --> 01:24:16.332
You can't.

1267
01:24:16.582 --> 01:24:17.541
Why?

1268
01:24:19.168 --> 01:24:20.961
Because I'm gonna get caught.

1269
01:25:24.859 --> 01:25:27.027
(horn sounds)

1270
01:25:27.528 --> 01:25:31.532
- (flies buzzing)
- (sirens wail in distance)


1271
01:27:35.781 --> 01:27:37.992
What's the reason for your visit
to Mexico, sir?


1272
01:27:38.534 --> 01:27:39.576
Vacation.

1273
01:27:40.077 --> 01:27:42.079
- May I see your ID?
- Yeah.


1274
01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.010
Where are you heading
for your vacation?


1275
01:27:56.385 --> 01:27:57.469
Uh, Baja.

1276
01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:59.221
Got an address?

1277
01:28:01.056 --> 01:28:02.308
I'm staying at the Four Seasons.

1278
01:28:02.599 --> 01:28:04.685
It's my mom's
wedding anniversary.


1279
01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:31.712
Go ahead.

1280
01:28:50.939 --> 01:28:51.940
Are you all right?

1281
01:28:52.107 --> 01:28:53.317
Do I look all right?

1282
01:28:53.484 --> 01:28:54.860
Give me your hand.

1283
01:29:00.074 --> 01:29:01.116
Where are we?

1284
01:29:02.034 --> 01:29:03.619
Somewhere in Mexico.

1285
01:29:04.286 --> 01:29:05.287
(chuckles)

1286
01:29:07.915 --> 01:29:09.083
Why'd you come back?

1287
01:29:16.882 --> 01:29:19.676
(sirens wail)

1288
01:29:55.879 --> 01:29:56.880
What happened?

1289
01:30:05.264 --> 01:30:07.224
(horn sounds)

1290
01:30:15.274 --> 01:30:19.153
(heart monitor beeps)

1291
01:30:27.453 --> 01:30:29.496
Vincent: (over recording)
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>


1292
01:30:31.748 --> 01:30:34.543
<i>I got the hospital staff to bring
this recording over to you.</i>


1293
01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:37.129
<i>I'm sorry I haven't been there
for a long while.</i>


1294
01:30:38.297 --> 01:30:39.298
<i>I just...</i>

1295
01:30:39.465 --> 01:30:41.592
<i>Just can't bear
to see you lying there.</i>


1296
01:30:42.926 --> 01:30:45.053
<i>I'm not good with emotion,
you know that.</i>


1297
01:30:46.263 --> 01:30:49.224
<i>The cab 's booked
for just after 11:00.</i>


1298
01:30:50.476 --> 01:30:52.936
<i>I love you more than anything
in the whole world.</i>


1299
01:30:54.104 --> 01:30:55.647
<i>You are my world.</i>

1300
01:30:58.984 --> 01:31:00.736
<i>Harper thinks
he's got something on me.</i>


1301
01:31:00.903 --> 01:31:02.613
<i>I don't know what he thinks
he knows,</i>


1302
01:31:02.779 --> 01:31:05.199
<i>but you don't need
to worry about it.</i>


1303
01:31:06.033 --> 01:31:07.075
<i>I'll take care of him.</i>

1304
01:31:08.619 --> 01:31:10.662
<i>You know,
I imagine us together...</i>


1305
01:31:11.622 --> 01:31:12.623
<i>real soon.</i>

1306
01:31:13.749 --> 01:31:15.334
<i>And we're gonna be so happy.</i>

1307
01:31:16.168 --> 01:31:18.378
<i>And all this misery
will be behind us.</i>


1308
01:32:02.756 --> 01:32:05.133
Cherry: <i>Johnny used to say
that bad luck followed me</i>


1309
01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.219
<i>like a pervert followed
a school bus.</i>


1310
01:32:10.597 --> 01:32:13.016
<i>But Johnny could be wrong,
just like anyone.</i>


1311
01:32:25.404 --> 01:32:28.407
He did say one thing, though,
that seemed to ring true...


1312
01:32:31.952 --> 01:32:33.745
<i>that when a man's got murder
on his mind...</i>


1313
01:32:34.538 --> 01:32:36.039
<i>he should dig two graves.</i>

1314
01:32:39.209 --> 01:32:40.419
<i>One for the victim.</i>

1315
01:32:42.212 --> 01:32:43.505
<i>And one for himself.</i>

1316
