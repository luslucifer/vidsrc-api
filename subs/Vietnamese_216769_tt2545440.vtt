00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:13.291
Cái quái gì trên
chiếc bánh cưới của tôi?

3
00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:23.401
Woman: Oh!

4
00:00:23.403 --> 00:00:24.002
Griffin.

5
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.938
Vấn đề là ở đây.

6
00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:29.874
Nó sẽ là của tôi

7
00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:34.512
Tiến lên chàng trai! 
Không phải cơ hôi của ông, Baldy!

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.116
Tiến lên

9
00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:41.519
Oop. Đáng ra đây đã
là một lễ cưới tốt lành.

10
00:01:07.313 --> 00:01:11.116
Griffin: Được rồi, tôi chắc bạn đang tự hỏi:
"Cái quái gì đang xảy ra ở đây ?"

11
00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:13.418
Chàng trai nào có
mái tóc xấu ở đây?

12
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.222
Tại sao ông ta lại ko mặc quần?

13
00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:19.057
<i>Ouch.</i>

14
00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:20.525
Đâu là cô gái đáng yêu nhất? <3

15
00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:22.927
Làm sao lấy được số của cô ấy?

16
00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.563
Clue. Bạn ko thể.

17
00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:27.799
Vậy đâu là người thứ hai?

18
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:31.202
Quan trọng là có
phải bạn đang tự hỏi..

19
00:01:31.204 --> 00:01:33.004
Tôi là ai?

20
00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:35.240
Tôi có thể trả lời câu hỏi này

21
00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:37.542
Griffin là tôi.

22
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:42.647
Được rồi. Tin mới nè. 
Hãy trở lại cùng để bắt đầu.

23
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.155
Xin chào các cô nàng

24
00:01:50.157 --> 00:01:53.391
Griffin, cậu đã làm bài tập Hóa chưa?

25
00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:55.994
GPA được giữ lại rồi.

26
00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.429
Chào mừng ,Kirsten.

27
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:01.833
Griffin, hãy thú nhận rằng cậu vừa
lấy quyển sách của Carver High đi.

28
00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:04.736
Dude, Cả đội nợ cậu nhiều.

29
00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:06.104
Whoo! Đi thôi, đại bàng -.-||!

30
00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:09.407
Yo, Griffin, cậu đã ghi
bàn hủy diệt cuối cùng?

31
00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:09.974
Phải rồi.

32
00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:13.311
Không thể nào. 
Thậm chí trò chơi này chưa ngừng cho đến tân tháng 9.

33
00:02:13.313 --> 00:02:16.047
Griffin, cậu đã nói
chuyện với Amanda Benson chưa?

34
00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.582
Cô ấy sẽ đi chơi với tớ?

35
00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:18.883
Câu trả lời là không
cho cả 2 câu hỏi.

36
00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:20.752
Câu muốn gì, Griffin?

37
00:02:20.754 --> 00:02:23.555
Tớ sưu tầm truyện
tranh, nhân vật hành động.

38
00:02:23.557 --> 00:02:24.989
Chúng có giá trị lớn.

39
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.792
Xem đi, Eddie. 
Tôi yêu sự đam mê của câu.

40
00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:29.294
Cảm ơn.

41
00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:31.696
Ừ, nhưng hãy kiếm tra Amanda.

42
00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:34.265
Griffin: Cô gái xinh đẹp
đứng thứ hai ở trường.

43
00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.434
Tớ tuyệt nên tớ sẽ có được.

44
00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:38.369
Nhưng tớ không phải là
một nhân vật kỳ diệu.

45
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:40.038
Griffin! Griffin!

46
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.307
Nhìn đồ chơi của tớ đi. 
Ugh, thật kinh tởm.

47
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.441
Tớ đang trên đường tới lớp nhạc kịch.

48
00:02:43.443 --> 00:02:45.343
Nơi tớ đang luyện tập lúc
trước là của 1 cô gái.

49
00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:46.811
một cái nhìn mới về nỗi
đau của một sinh viên năm nhất,

50
00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:49.047
mà tới nghĩ là cả
hai khiêu khích và cam đoan.

51
00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.715
Mặc dù điều này hơi mâu thuẫn.

52
00:02:50.717 --> 00:02:52.917
Đợi chút, Savannah. 
Giống... cái gì?

53
00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.552
Điểm chăng??.

54
00:02:54.554 --> 00:02:55.820
Số điểm của tớ đã từng... Ben

55
00:02:55.822 --> 00:02:59.524
Anh ta vừa đổ ly sinh tố
của mình lên anh chàng Darren Vader.

56
00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:02.360
Griffin: Oh, không

57
00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:04.829
Griffin. Ko phải bây giờ

58
00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:07.365
Để sau đi.

59
00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:11.669
Ben: Hãy xem đi, Darren,
Tớ ko thấy cậu đứng đó.

60
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:14.839
Nhưng công bằng thì ở đây
có 2 nạn nhân. Ý tớ là...

61
00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:17.909
Có phải tớ vừa nhận được
sinh tố xôi và xoài ko?

62
00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:19.110
Yeah. Yeah?

63
00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:20.111
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:23.081
Và cậu cũng ko may mắn lắm

65
00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.420
Thôi nào

66
00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:32.090
Darren. Dừng lại.

67
00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:34.926
Tôi biết cậu cần những gì.

68
00:03:34.928 --> 00:03:37.795
Ben: (bị bóp nghẹt) Yeah,
anh ta đã nhận nó.

69
00:03:38.931 --> 00:03:40.431
Có phải là đúng những thứ đấy ko?

70
00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:41.633
Yeah.

71
00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:46.004
Vậy để bạn tớ yên được ko?

72
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:04.088
Được thôi.

73
00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:13.064
Hey, Darren.

74
00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:28.046
Cậu ổn ko?

75
00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:31.549
Ko hẳn. Nhân phẩm của
tớ đã bị ném đi rồi.

76
00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:33.651
Ah, Ben.

77
00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:36.955
Cậu ko nên sử dụng nó mà.

78
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:49.901
Dude, Montana thật bốc mùi.

79
00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:51.402
Do múi giờ khác nhau chăng?

80
00:04:51.404 --> 00:04:52.937
Chúng tớ đã từng chat với nhau.

81
00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.206
Cậu nói về người thâm
chí tớ còn ko biết.

82
00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.075
Ben, hey, Ben!

83
00:04:57.077 --> 00:04:57.976
Tin tốt đấy, Ben.

84
00:04:57.978 --> 00:04:59.010
Có thể chúng ta ko cần đến Montana

85
00:04:59.012 --> 00:05:01.145
và sống với chú cậu sau tất cả.

86
00:05:01.147 --> 00:05:01.913
Cậu có việc ko? Không?

87
00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:05.483
Tớ có sáng kiến này. Xem đi.

88
00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:09.687
Tớ gọi nó là "Nhận lấy nó".

89
00:05:09.788 --> 00:05:10.755
Với 1 chữ thường "I."

90
00:05:10.757 --> 00:05:13.691
Tớ hiểu rồi. 
Trendy... ish.

91
00:05:13.693 --> 00:05:15.326
Được rồi, tưởng tượng tớ là
một chiếc ghế khoai tây lười biếng

92
00:05:15.328 --> 00:05:18.496
đắm mình trong mỡ lợn bầy nhầy
và thất bại, ngồi ngay đây thôi.

93
00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:20.298
Tớ không muốn, Mr.Dupree. 
Hắn vừa nói gì cơ?

94
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.502
Và tớ nhận ra: "Hey,
đây là cách tớ thường uống."

95
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.775
Lấy được ngay đây. (Cười)

96
00:05:30.777 --> 00:05:32.877
Cần chút ánh sáng ko?

97
00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.412
(Beeping)
Bang!


98
00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.216
Ánh sáng ngay đây.

99
00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:42.120
Hey, Điều khiển đâu nhỉ?

100
00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:43.921
Mr.Dupree: Bam!

101
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.893
Nó ngay trên tay cậu.

102
00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:50.194
Ngay đó.

103
00:05:50.196 --> 00:05:51.696
Cảm ơn, "Nhận lấy nó."

104
00:05:51.698 --> 00:05:54.098
Thực tế cậu biết
nó ko tồi. Đúng ko?

105
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.568
Tớ đã nói với cậu một trong những phát
minh này sẽ làm hết mọi việc của một ngày,

106
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.737
hay tớ nên nói là Thứ Bảy

107
00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:01.305
Khi tớ nhập "Hố rắn"

108
00:06:01.307 --> 00:06:02.707
Chương trình "Hố rắn"?

109
00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:04.942
Yeah, ba phút.
để ném thành quả của cậu đi.


110
00:06:04.944 --> 00:06:06.944
Một trong những điều tốt nhất là, như,
một đống toàn bộ tiền mặt. Phải vậy!

111
00:06:06.946 --> 00:06:09.847
Hiện tại tớ đã tốn
$300 cho phí nhập cảnh.

112
00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.783
Tất cả những gì tớ
cần làm bây giờ là.....

113
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.788
Oh.

114
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:18.423
Oops.

115
00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:20.758
Decided to do
a little remodeling?


116
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.560
It's just a few bugs
in the igot it.


117
00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:25.463
And what's this
gonna cost to fix?


118
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:27.932
I'm guessing about...

119
00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:31.202
Three hundred dollars.
(Groans)


120
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:35.139
So long, <i>snake pit.</i>
<i>Hello, Montana.</i>


121
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:36.774
Would you two
sweep this up?


122
00:06:36.776 --> 00:06:38.676
The master inventor and I
need to make


123
00:06:38.678 --> 00:06:41.479
yet another emergency trip
to the hardware store


124
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:45.450
before we show the house
to the realtor tomorrow.


125
00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:56.961
What the...

126
00:06:59.131 --> 00:07:01.732
What's this?

127
00:07:03.502 --> 00:07:07.171
Um, must have belonged
to whoever used to live here.


128
00:07:07.173 --> 00:07:09.006
It belongs to you now.

129
00:07:12.978 --> 00:07:14.245
"Honus Wagner."

130
00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:15.947
(Scoffs)
Nice haircut.


131
00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.984
Baseball card?
Yeah. An old one.


132
00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.720
Might even
be worth something.


133
00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:25.490
Well, how much?

134
00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:28.126
At least $300.
Come on,
I know a place we can go,


135
00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:29.026
but it closes at 6:00.

136
00:07:29.028 --> 00:07:31.095
Hey, we should
look it up first.


137
00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:33.464
No time, come on.
Trust me.


138
00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:42.140
Swindell:
No, a deal is a deal!


139
00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:43.875
You back out on this,
and I will sue.


140
00:07:43.877 --> 00:07:45.676
I will take you
for every last dime.


141
00:07:45.678 --> 00:07:49.180
I will squeeze every penny
out of your pathetic...


142
00:07:49.182 --> 00:07:51.582
Oh, customers.
Got to go, grandma.


143
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.454
Gentlemen, what can
I interest you in today?


144
00:07:56.456 --> 00:08:00.024
Actually, we were
hoping to interest you
in something, Mr. swindle.


145
00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:04.095
Ah, it's "swindell."
Accent on the back half.


146
00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:06.564
All right, what do you got?

147
00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:12.303
Is it worth anything?

148
00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:15.373
Uh,

149
00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:16.807
well, uh,

150
00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:18.075
it's old, huh?

151
00:08:18.077 --> 00:08:20.011
You know,
it's good condition.


152
00:08:20.013 --> 00:08:24.482
No creases or folds
or frays.


153
00:08:24.484 --> 00:08:27.151
But, you know,
that doesn't necessarily
translate to value.


154
00:08:27.153 --> 00:08:32.523
You understand.
I mean, who's ever heard
of this "honus Wagner?"


155
00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:35.726
I'm sorry, but this card
isn't worth beans.


156
00:08:36.862 --> 00:08:39.330
But, look! Uh...

157
00:08:39.332 --> 00:08:40.464
Aw, man, I like you kids.

158
00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:42.800
I'd hate to see you
go home empty handed.


159
00:08:42.802 --> 00:08:45.403
How about I take it
off your hands for, say...


160
00:08:45.405 --> 00:08:46.938
Ten bucks?
How's that sound?


161
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.341
(Chuckling)
It sounds like you think
we're stupid, Mr. swindell.


162
00:08:50.343 --> 00:08:52.143
Sorry to waste
your time.


163
00:08:52.145 --> 00:08:52.843
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

164
00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:55.479
(Swindell chuckling)
Okay, you got me,
yeah, yeah, yeah.


165
00:08:55.481 --> 00:08:57.915
You got me.
Yeah, it's worth
more than that.


166
00:08:57.917 --> 00:09:02.386
Um, look, $100.
I'll give you $100 for it.


167
00:09:02.388 --> 00:09:04.989
Ooh, is that the best
you can do?


168
00:09:04.991 --> 00:09:07.291
Look, kid.
A hundred is generous.


169
00:09:07.293 --> 00:09:09.760
Oh, yeah,
Griffin, generous.


170
00:09:11.163 --> 00:09:12.296
Three fifty, no less.

171
00:09:12.298 --> 00:09:13.965
No less?
Ah, no way.


172
00:09:13.967 --> 00:09:14.899
Fine, bye.

173
00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:18.402
(Stuttering) Okay.
One fifty.


174
00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:21.606
Four hundred.
What are you doing?


175
00:09:21.608 --> 00:09:23.374
Two seventy five,
not a penny more.


176
00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:25.676
Four fifty,
not a penny less.


177
00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:27.612
What's your name, kid?

178
00:09:27.746 --> 00:09:30.147
Bing, Griffin bing.

179
00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:32.817
Griffin.

180
00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:34.685
I like your moxie, huh.

181
00:09:34.687 --> 00:09:36.087
Reminds me of a young me.

182
00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:38.889
(Chuckling)
All right, okay, you win.


183
00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:41.025
Three fifty,
take it or leave it.


184
00:09:41.027 --> 00:09:42.627
Take it.
Ah.


185
00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:48.633
Three hundred
and fifty dollars.


186
00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:52.103
Dude, you were like
a negotiating ninja.


187
00:09:52.105 --> 00:09:53.738
You were all
slash, slash, slash.


188
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.540
And he was all,
"ah, take my money."


189
00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:57.608
(Chuckling)
Well, thank you
very much.


190
00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.945
Look, my dad
gets to go the <i>snake pit,</i>
<i>sell his invention,</i>


191
00:10:00.947 --> 00:10:04.015
and we don't have
to leave our home.


192
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.928
Hey, are there
any pop strudels left?


193
00:10:22.768 --> 00:10:24.635
Oh, no.

194
00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:31.509
No, no, no.

195
00:10:31.511 --> 00:10:33.811
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no,


196
00:10:33.813 --> 00:10:35.012
no, no, no, no, no.

197
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.951
Ben, Ben, Ben!

198
00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:41.752
Ben!

199
00:10:41.754 --> 00:10:43.888
Ben, whatever you do,
don't read the paper or...


200
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.991
Man: (On TV)
<i>So you had the good fortune</i>
<i></i> <i>to come across it.</i>


201
00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:47.725
Turn on the TV.

202
00:10:47.727 --> 00:10:49.126
Man: (On TV)
<i>There are only five</i>
<i>known honus wagners.</i>


203
00:10:49.128 --> 00:10:52.330
Swindell:
<i>Oh, it's pronounced "honus."</i>
<i></i> <i>And this makes it six now.</i>


204
00:10:52.332 --> 00:10:54.231
Man: (On TV)
<i>Thank you for that.</i>
<i>So what is it worth?</i>


205
00:10:54.233 --> 00:10:58.536
<i>An estimated</i>
<i></i> <i>$1.2 million at least.</i>


206
00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:01.238
(Swindell chuckles)
Man: (On TV)
<i>How does one find a buyer?</i>


207
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.607
<i>Oh, I'll have no trouble</i>
<i></i> <i>finding a buyer.</i>


208
00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:07.545
<i>I mean, collectors</i>
<i></i> <i>will be lined up for this.</i>


209
00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:10.548
<i>I mean, the phone's</i>
<i></i> <i>gonna be ringing</i>
<i></i> <i>off the hook.</i>


210
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.784
<i>You know, so...</i>
<i></i> <i>You know, give me a ring.</i>
<i></i> <i>Give me a call.</i>


211
00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:15.586
$1.2 million?

212
00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:18.155
Okay, Ben, I admit it.

213
00:11:18.157 --> 00:11:18.889
He got me, okay?

214
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:20.624
I... I should have
seen it coming,
and I didn't.


215
00:11:20.626 --> 00:11:23.127
He's good.
I'll give him that.


216
00:11:24.062 --> 00:11:25.396
$1.2 million?

217
00:11:25.398 --> 00:11:28.833
Yeah, I know.
I was a little off.


218
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:30.835
$1.2 million.

219
00:11:30.837 --> 00:11:32.470
Okay, Ben, Ben,
listen to me.


220
00:11:32.472 --> 00:11:34.939
Okay, I will get you
that card back.
I promise.


221
00:11:34.941 --> 00:11:36.607
I will get you that card,
and you will sell it,


222
00:11:36.609 --> 00:11:39.477
and your toes
will never touch
Montana grass.


223
00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:41.445
Okay, Ben?

224
00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:45.216
Are those silk?

225
00:11:45.218 --> 00:11:48.018
Yeah. I like the way
they breathe.


226
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.488
Nice.
Thanks.


227
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.426
You ripped us off.

228
00:11:55.428 --> 00:11:56.994
(Chuckling)
Oh, you two.


229
00:11:56.996 --> 00:12:00.231
Look, unless you've
discovered another
priceless collectible,


230
00:12:00.233 --> 00:12:01.132
beat it.

231
00:12:01.134 --> 00:12:02.166
Give me my card back.

232
00:12:02.168 --> 00:12:04.168
Oh, no, no, no,
you mean my card.


233
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.270
See, you sold it to me.
I paid for it.


234
00:12:06.272 --> 00:12:09.006
That makes it my card,
free and clear.
See how that works?


235
00:12:09.008 --> 00:12:11.675
Well, you lied to us.
Yeah, we'll go to the cops.


236
00:12:11.677 --> 00:12:12.510
And tell 'em what?

237
00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:13.577
I mean, what law
did I break?


238
00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:17.314
It's not my fault
you didn't know
the value of your card.


239
00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:19.517
I mean,
you ever hear
of the Internet?


240
00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.252
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:21.987 --> 00:12:23.053
But this isn't fair.

242
00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:24.688
Uh-huh, face it, dude.

243
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.624
You got swindled.

244
00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:32.129
Ah, don't feel bad.

245
00:12:32.264 --> 00:12:34.365
Ah, I'll tell you what.

246
00:12:36.034 --> 00:12:38.035
Have a mint.

247
00:12:40.872 --> 00:12:43.040
$1.2 million.

248
00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:45.910
Oh, it tastes
like failure.


249
00:12:45.912 --> 00:12:48.779
I will find a way
to make this better, Ben.


250
00:12:48.781 --> 00:12:50.247
Shh, can't get any worse.

251
00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:54.185
Mom?

252
00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:55.152
Wait.
Mom, no.


253
00:12:55.154 --> 00:12:56.754
Mom, no...Don't send us
to Montana, not yet.


254
00:12:56.756 --> 00:12:59.490
What about the igot it?
Dad can still save us.


255
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:05.496
Dad: Whoops.

256
00:13:05.498 --> 00:13:05.996
You all right?

257
00:13:05.998 --> 00:13:08.732
Dad: Just a few bugs
to work out
before Saturday.


258
00:13:09.469 --> 00:13:11.135
I'm sorry, baby.

259
00:13:11.137 --> 00:13:13.904
Let's not get our hopes up.

260
00:13:18.343 --> 00:13:19.810
We have to steal
the card back.


261
00:13:19.812 --> 00:13:21.045
Whoa, steal the card?
"Back."


262
00:13:21.047 --> 00:13:23.180
That's an important word
you're leaving out there.


263
00:13:23.182 --> 00:13:24.081
We're just righting a wrong.

264
00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:26.116
Oh, well, the police
still call that stealing.


265
00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:29.420
We can't pull
this off alone.
We'll need help.


266
00:13:36.928 --> 00:13:40.931
Why is it
they call me freshman


267
00:13:41.733 --> 00:13:44.301
when I am neither fresh

268
00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:46.370
nor man?

269
00:13:46.372 --> 00:13:48.472
Nay, I am more than...

270
00:13:48.474 --> 00:13:49.306
You're kidding, right?

271
00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:52.543
Stale bread
in a torn lunch bag


272
00:13:52.545 --> 00:13:56.814
or gum
stuck to the bottom


273
00:13:56.816 --> 00:14:00.751
of a worn shoe.

274
00:14:00.753 --> 00:14:05.055
Okay, yes,
Savannah's material is a bit,
you know, inaccessible,


275
00:14:05.057 --> 00:14:07.424
but she's got it
where it counts.


276
00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:08.926
Ah!

277
00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:15.833
Besides, she owes me.

278
00:14:31.816 --> 00:14:33.450
Hey, buddy!

279
00:14:34.286 --> 00:14:36.186
You're taking up
two spots.


280
00:14:36.188 --> 00:14:37.888
Sorry. I don't want
to get any dings,


281
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.825
especially from
that garbage truck
you're driving.


282
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.668
Move your car.

283
00:14:52.003 --> 00:14:53.137
Or what?

284
00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:55.873
Ha, okay, all right.

285
00:15:00.712 --> 00:15:02.212
Whoa.

286
00:15:02.214 --> 00:15:03.213
Hey.

287
00:15:05.784 --> 00:15:06.684
Whoa.

288
00:15:06.686 --> 00:15:09.587
Yeah. That just happened.

289
00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:20.965
No, absolutely not.

290
00:15:20.967 --> 00:15:23.767
In the fifth grade,
Darren killed a kid


291
00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:24.702
just by looking at him.

292
00:15:24.704 --> 00:15:26.837
Not true,
but you prove my point.


293
00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:28.372
Darren's tough, intimidating,

294
00:15:28.374 --> 00:15:31.375
and, most importantly,
has his own ride.


295
00:15:31.377 --> 00:15:33.544
Besides, he owes me.

296
00:15:40.752 --> 00:15:43.954
Fine, but I get to pick
the next team member.


297
00:15:44.556 --> 00:15:46.957
All: Go, eagles, go.

298
00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:50.160
Go, eagles, go.

299
00:15:50.162 --> 00:15:52.496
Amanda Benson?
Really?


300
00:15:52.498 --> 00:15:55.299
Other than being the second
prettiest girl in school...


301
00:15:55.301 --> 00:15:56.367
Which you cannot dismiss.

302
00:15:56.369 --> 00:15:57.901
What can she bring
to the party?


303
00:15:57.903 --> 00:15:59.903
All: Go, eagles, go.

304
00:15:59.905 --> 00:16:02.006
Eagles, go.

305
00:16:06.344 --> 00:16:09.947
How about that?
That could be useful.


306
00:16:10.348 --> 00:16:12.149
Go, eagles!

307
00:16:12.151 --> 00:16:13.550
Yeah!

308
00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:15.653
Yeah!

309
00:16:18.123 --> 00:16:20.090
Yeah, whoo!

310
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:24.928
And she does owe me.

311
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.697
Griffin bing.

312
00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:28.232
Is it later yet?

313
00:16:28.234 --> 00:16:31.368
I've been a little busy.
You're always busy.


314
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.237
But I want in.

315
00:16:33.705 --> 00:16:34.605
In?

316
00:16:34.607 --> 00:16:35.906
(Chuckles)
Into what?


317
00:16:35.908 --> 00:16:37.508
Into whatever
you're planning.


318
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.709
(Scoffs) I'm not planning
anything.


319
00:16:38.711 --> 00:16:42.446
Of course you are.
You're always
planning something.


320
00:16:42.448 --> 00:16:43.647
She's right.
You are...


321
00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:44.281
Ben.
Sorry.


322
00:16:44.283 --> 00:16:47.017
I can help.
I've got skills you can use.


323
00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:48.118
You need me.

324
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.921
(Chuckles)
I doubt that.


325
00:16:51.089 --> 00:16:52.756
Later.

326
00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:56.960
So we've got our team.

327
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.632
And we're gonna get them
to do this how?


328
00:17:01.634 --> 00:17:02.866
Ben, please.

329
00:17:02.868 --> 00:17:05.402
No one can deny me.

330
00:17:05.737 --> 00:17:06.603
Nope.

331
00:17:06.605 --> 00:17:08.038
Whoa, wait.
Where are you going?


332
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.307
Listen, I don't
want to speak
for these refugees


333
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:12.443
from the island
of misfit losers,
no offense...


334
00:17:12.445 --> 00:17:16.413
But this sounds
a lot like something
the cops call stealing.


335
00:17:17.415 --> 00:17:18.816
I told you.

336
00:17:18.818 --> 00:17:19.683
Uh, sorry, Griffin,

337
00:17:19.685 --> 00:17:22.352
but I can have no part
in criminal mischief.


338
00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:24.822
Yep, that's what
my parole officer says.


339
00:17:24.824 --> 00:17:27.458
Stop. Just...
Come back


340
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.761
and hear me out
for a second, okay?


341
00:17:31.629 --> 00:17:32.730
Ben is the only person

342
00:17:32.732 --> 00:17:36.800
who doesn't want
anything from me
but friendship.


343
00:17:37.068 --> 00:17:39.570
He's my best friend...
My only friend...


344
00:17:39.572 --> 00:17:42.639
And I let him down,
big-time,


345
00:17:42.641 --> 00:17:46.176
so I need to get
that card back.


346
00:17:47.412 --> 00:17:49.947
We need to get
that card back.


347
00:17:54.352 --> 00:17:55.452
Nope.

348
00:17:55.454 --> 00:17:56.520
Okay, we'll do it
this way.


349
00:17:56.522 --> 00:17:59.790
Savannah, who got you
that pita king commercial
last fall?


350
00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:01.692
That was you, Griffin.

351
00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:02.793
Right, oh, and by the way,

352
00:18:02.795 --> 00:18:03.827
you make
a very convincing kebab.


353
00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:07.664
Oh, with the chicken...
Thank you so much.
Thank you.


354
00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:08.799
And, Amanda, last year,

355
00:18:08.801 --> 00:18:11.335
you were the third prettiest
girl in school,


356
00:18:11.337 --> 00:18:13.570
that is, until
Megan Wright's father


357
00:18:13.572 --> 00:18:15.873
was mysteriously transferred
to Denver.


358
00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:16.607
You said you...

359
00:18:16.609 --> 00:18:18.609
You did that?
No comment.


360
00:18:19.512 --> 00:18:21.278
And how about you, Darren?

361
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.681
You want to keep
that supply of Latvian
hair cream coming?


362
00:18:24.883 --> 00:18:26.283
Latvian hair cream?

363
00:18:26.285 --> 00:18:27.551
Okay, all right, Latvia...

364
00:18:27.553 --> 00:18:29.920
Yeah, Latvia
makes the world's
best hair cream.


365
00:18:29.922 --> 00:18:33.223
All right,
nothing else comes close.


366
00:18:34.493 --> 00:18:35.459
Mmm-mmm.

367
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:37.327
What? I like
to pamper myself.


368
00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:39.696
Huh.
(Mouthing words)


369
00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:44.434
Face it,
you all owe me big.


370
00:18:53.645 --> 00:18:55.179
Still nope.

371
00:18:56.314 --> 00:18:57.915
25,000.

372
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:00.918
25,000 what?

373
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.121
Dollars.
After we sell the card,
I will pay you...


374
00:19:04.123 --> 00:19:05.322
All: In.

375
00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:09.259
All right.
Pound it, team.


376
00:19:13.164 --> 00:19:14.932
Pound it.

377
00:19:15.867 --> 00:19:17.167
Fine.

378
00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:23.707
So, uh,
when we doing this?


379
00:19:26.377 --> 00:19:28.245
How's tonight?

380
00:19:29.681 --> 00:19:32.683
Griffin: <i>We've been</i>
<i></i> <i>watching swindell.</i>


381
00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:33.917
<i>Every night at 6:00 sharp,</i>

382
00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.520
<i>he closes his shop</i>
<i></i> <i>and steps out for dinner.</i>


383
00:19:36.522 --> 00:19:39.623
Wong's Chinese garden,
"best mu-shu in town."


384
00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:43.327
Griffin: <i>More importantly,</i>
<i></i> <i>every night,</i>
<i></i> <i>he sets the alarm.</i>


385
00:19:43.329 --> 00:19:44.127
<i>Once it's armed...</i>

386
00:19:44.129 --> 00:19:46.964
(Electronic voice)
<i>Alarm sequence activated.</i>


387
00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:47.831
<i>You may exit now.</i>

388
00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:51.235
Griffin:
<i>We have 30 seconds</i>
<i></i> <i>to turn it off.</i>


389
00:19:54.038 --> 00:19:56.874
<i>Then it takes swindell</i>
<i></i> <i>exactly seven minutes</i>


390
00:19:56.876 --> 00:19:59.142
<i>to get his food</i>
<i>and come back.</i>


391
00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.179
We are go.

392
00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:04.281
All right, Darren,
Amanda, heave-ho.


393
00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:06.817
Aim me right.
I don't want to be
a stain on the wall.


394
00:20:06.819 --> 00:20:10.854
Stop whining, all right?
You're not the first person
I've thrown.


395
00:20:19.597 --> 00:20:20.731
Whoa.

396
00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:22.699
(Neck cracks) Huh.

397
00:20:23.368 --> 00:20:25.769
Oh, 18 seconds.

398
00:20:31.343 --> 00:20:32.509
Ew.

399
00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:34.511
It looks 1973
died in here.


400
00:20:34.513 --> 00:20:38.615
(Electronic voice)
<i>You have five seconds</i>
<i></i> <i>to exit.</i>


401
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.984
<i>Five, four,</i>

402
00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:43.453
<i>three, two,</i>

403
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:44.688
<i>one.</i>

404
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:48.058
<i>System disarmed.</i>

405
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.262
I mean, yes,
Donna Hernandez is
"technically prettier,"


406
00:20:52.264 --> 00:20:53.463
but could Donna Hernandez

407
00:20:53.465 --> 00:20:55.866
have flipped up
onto that roof like that?


408
00:20:55.868 --> 00:20:57.134
(Scoffs)
I'd say no.


409
00:20:57.136 --> 00:20:59.169
We are disarmed.
Awesome.


410
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:00.971
Darren, Savannah,
you know what to do.


411
00:21:00.973 --> 00:21:01.605
Buy us some time.

412
00:21:01.607 --> 00:21:03.206
Oh, Griffin, this next
performance shall be
my finest,


413
00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:05.542
for I shall be
thrust onto the
greatest of stages...


414
00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:07.244
Floor it, please.
On it.


415
00:21:07.246 --> 00:21:09.713
Reality, where you
never know what's
coming. What is...


416
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.649
Savannah: That's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.


417
00:21:12.651 --> 00:21:15.285
I'm... I'm still ready.
I'm still ready to go.


418
00:21:17.522 --> 00:21:19.089
Let's move.

419
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:23.060
This way to Mr. Wagner.

420
00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:31.268
It's not
in there.
Oh, no.


421
00:21:31.369 --> 00:21:32.369
It's not in the case.

422
00:21:32.371 --> 00:21:34.805
But it's got to be
here somewhere.
Start looking.


423
00:21:40.979 --> 00:21:44.514
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.


424
00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:51.888
It's not in here.
Check the register.


425
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.691
Yeah, I'm on it.
(Beeps)


426
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:06.737
Me, me, me, me, me.

427
00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:08.605
Total, ha, ha, ha.

428
00:22:08.607 --> 00:22:11.074
Ts-ts-ts.
(Singsong) Oh, wah!


429
00:22:11.076 --> 00:22:12.843
What are you doing?

430
00:22:12.845 --> 00:22:15.412
I'm warming up.
You should too.


431
00:22:15.414 --> 00:22:18.415
I need you
to support my
performance.


432
00:22:18.417 --> 00:22:19.716
Wait. What?

433
00:22:28.927 --> 00:22:31.928
Hey! I got
mu-shu here!


434
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.197
Get out of the road!

435
00:22:36.134 --> 00:22:41.705
This is bevie montague
for channel 3 with
another "focus on you."


436
00:22:41.707 --> 00:22:44.174
Sir. Sir.

437
00:22:45.244 --> 00:22:48.945
Oh, sir, what do
you think are the
biggest problems


438
00:22:48.947 --> 00:22:50.247
plaguing society today?

439
00:22:50.249 --> 00:22:52.916
(Sighs)
Too many TV
news channels.


440
00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:03.193
So, Savannah, yeah,
you still warmed up?


441
00:23:03.195 --> 00:23:05.729
Huh? (Chuckles)

442
00:23:07.899 --> 00:23:09.332
Come on.

443
00:23:09.334 --> 00:23:10.967
Huh, come on.

444
00:23:10.969 --> 00:23:12.969
Be here.

445
00:23:13.805 --> 00:23:15.772
(Clattering)

446
00:23:15.907 --> 00:23:17.240
Ah!

447
00:23:17.242 --> 00:23:18.442
Ben?

448
00:23:18.444 --> 00:23:20.911
Ben, speak to me, buddy.

449
00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:24.548
Seriously, who would buy this?

450
00:23:28.186 --> 00:23:30.454
Okay, to be a
believable character,


451
00:23:30.456 --> 00:23:32.456
you need a
believable motivation.


452
00:23:32.458 --> 00:23:33.757
Have you found yours?

453
00:23:33.759 --> 00:23:35.926
Yeah, I'm hungry.

454
00:23:44.235 --> 00:23:47.170
(Muffled voice)
Give me the mu-shu.
What?


455
00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:48.472
(Muffled voice)
Give me the mu-shu.


456
00:23:48.474 --> 00:23:50.107
I don't know
what you're saying.


457
00:23:50.109 --> 00:23:52.175
Dude, I... I said
give me the mu-shu.


458
00:23:52.177 --> 00:23:53.477
Oh!
Yeah.


459
00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:54.778
I don't think so.

460
00:23:59.618 --> 00:24:02.419
Never get between
a man and his mu-shu.


461
00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:07.724
Okay, good start.

462
00:24:07.726 --> 00:24:09.326
I've got a few notes.
(Electricity crackling)


463
00:24:09.328 --> 00:24:13.630
(Stutters)
Shut... shut up.
Shut up. Ah, shut up.


464
00:24:13.632 --> 00:24:15.799
All right,
I'll give you a moment.


465
00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:17.834
It's fine. It's fine.

466
00:24:17.836 --> 00:24:20.137
Time for plan "c."

467
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:24.741
Can somebody help me?

468
00:24:24.743 --> 00:24:26.843
Help, please, anybody.

469
00:24:26.845 --> 00:24:28.445
Anyone, anyone...

470
00:24:28.447 --> 00:24:30.780
Is somebody there?
No.


471
00:24:31.082 --> 00:24:34.084
Oh, there is someone
there. Where are you?


472
00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:36.319
I'm speaking
to you, young man.


473
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:37.654
Yeah, look,
I'm sorry, sis.


474
00:24:37.656 --> 00:24:40.157
It's just, I got takeout.
You understand.


475
00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:41.691
Oh, save your excuses!

476
00:24:41.693 --> 00:24:44.261
I need someone
to wheel me
to St. Agatha's


477
00:24:44.263 --> 00:24:47.531
of the righteous
and redeemed.


478
00:24:48.634 --> 00:24:52.102
Young man, I am waiting.

479
00:24:52.104 --> 00:24:54.638
Ow! Hey!
Okay, okay.


480
00:24:56.307 --> 00:24:57.941
Thank you.

481
00:25:01.479 --> 00:25:04.548
I got a bad feeling
about this.


482
00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:16.593
You scared me.
I thought you
were a burglar.


483
00:25:16.595 --> 00:25:20.931
Uh, I am a burglar,
and so are you.


484
00:25:21.432 --> 00:25:22.432
We're all burglars.

485
00:25:22.434 --> 00:25:23.600
Wait. Darren,
what are you doing?


486
00:25:23.602 --> 00:25:25.135
You're supposed to
be on distraction duty.


487
00:25:25.137 --> 00:25:25.835
Yeah, I know. I know.

488
00:25:25.837 --> 00:25:29.272
But swindell's close,
and actor girl, yeah,


489
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.074
she's sucking wind.

490
00:25:31.076 --> 00:25:32.209
Okay, we got to hurry.

491
00:25:32.211 --> 00:25:33.710
Ben: We've got to find it!

492
00:25:33.712 --> 00:25:36.379
What am I
supposed to do?
We can't find the card.


493
00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:38.648
Okay.
Look!


494
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:42.052
Savannah: Oh, this is perfect.

495
00:25:42.054 --> 00:25:43.820
Thank you for
wheeling me here.


496
00:25:43.822 --> 00:25:47.591
Now I can go
visit my sisters
in the convent,


497
00:25:47.593 --> 00:25:49.759
and I can see...

498
00:25:51.963 --> 00:25:53.063
Um...

499
00:25:53.065 --> 00:25:53.563
Young man,

500
00:25:53.565 --> 00:25:57.200
I'm not certain this
is the proper route
to the convent.


501
00:25:57.202 --> 00:25:58.335
Oh, sure it is, sis.

502
00:25:58.337 --> 00:26:00.537
I'll just point you
in the right direction


503
00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:03.106
and let gravity
do the rest.


504
00:26:03.874 --> 00:26:05.108
See you, sis!

505
00:26:10.315 --> 00:26:12.349
Pray for me!

506
00:26:17.221 --> 00:26:18.722
He's close.

507
00:26:18.724 --> 00:26:20.423
Let's go.

508
00:26:20.658 --> 00:26:23.426
Fate, you've
pantsed me again!


509
00:26:23.428 --> 00:26:24.794
Ben.

510
00:26:30.334 --> 00:26:32.302
Found it.

511
00:26:39.778 --> 00:26:41.278
Nice honus.

512
00:26:43.781 --> 00:26:45.782
Down.
(Gasps)


513
00:26:54.558 --> 00:26:56.426
Oh, great.

514
00:27:01.198 --> 00:27:03.333
Ugh, it's cold.

515
00:27:05.736 --> 00:27:09.272
Did I forget
to set the alarm?


516
00:27:12.443 --> 00:27:15.278
(Mumbling) I always
set the alarm.


517
00:27:19.818 --> 00:27:23.720
(Electronic voice)
<i>Alarm sequence activated.</i>


518
00:28:42.967 --> 00:28:45.168
Yello,
swindell's collectibles.


519
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.936
Bonjour, monsieur <i>swindle.</i>

520
00:28:46.938 --> 00:28:49.472
"Swindell."
Accent on the back half.


521
00:28:49.474 --> 00:28:52.075
French man: <i>Yes, of course,</i>
<i>monsieur</i> <i>swindell.</i>


522
00:28:52.077 --> 00:28:54.444
<i>I understand you</i>
<i></i> <i>recently acquired</i>


523
00:28:54.446 --> 00:28:57.046
<i>the honus Wagner</i>
<i></i> <i>baseball card.</i>


524
00:28:57.048 --> 00:29:00.417
Yeah. It's worth
a fortune and a half.
You interested?


525
00:29:00.419 --> 00:29:04.721
(Laughing)
<i>Oh, for myself, no.</i>


526
00:29:04.723 --> 00:29:06.289
<i>But my clients might be.</i>

527
00:29:06.291 --> 00:29:08.525
Oh.
<i>They are very rich.</i>


528
00:29:09.828 --> 00:29:10.994
<i>I am Anton Lefevre.</i>

529
00:29:10.996 --> 00:29:16.533
Uh-huh.
<i>And I run the greatest</i>
<i>auction in the world.</i>


530
00:29:16.934 --> 00:29:18.902
Anton lefavor?

531
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.770
The Anton lefavor?

532
00:29:20.772 --> 00:29:23.640
<i>Oh.</i> (Clears throat)
<i>You've heard of me.</i>


533
00:29:23.642 --> 00:29:26.443
Yeah, so has every...
Whoa, nose!


534
00:29:27.344 --> 00:29:29.345
I mean, knows...

535
00:29:29.347 --> 00:29:32.449
Knows. Yeah, everyone
in collectibles knows you.


536
00:29:32.451 --> 00:29:35.051
I mean,
it's been my dream
to sell my stuff


537
00:29:35.053 --> 00:29:35.852
at your auction.
(Sighs)


538
00:29:35.854 --> 00:29:41.858
Anton: <i>Well, then, I am</i>
<i></i> <i>very happy to extend</i>
<i></i> <i>to you an invitation.</i>


539
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.559
(Whispers) The alarm.

540
00:29:42.561 --> 00:29:46.596
<i>This year's auction</i>
<i></i> <i>is being held at the</i>
<i></i> <i>lakeshore hotel resort.</i>


541
00:29:46.598 --> 00:29:48.131
<i>Can you be there</i>
<i>this Saturday?</i>


542
00:29:48.133 --> 00:29:49.732
(Chuckles)
You kidding me?


543
00:29:49.734 --> 00:29:50.533
Security can't keep me away.

544
00:29:50.535 --> 00:29:55.171
<i>Selling your card at</i>
<i></i> <i>my auction will make</i>
<i></i> <i>you a very rich man.</i>


545
00:29:55.173 --> 00:29:58.508
(Stammers)
Let me write this down.


546
00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.676
(Whispering)
How do we get out of here?


547
00:29:59.678 --> 00:30:01.845
(Whispering) We can't,
not while the alarm is on.


548
00:30:01.847 --> 00:30:05.114
That's lakeshore hotel, huh?

549
00:30:05.116 --> 00:30:06.182
This Saturday.
Oui.


550
00:30:06.184 --> 00:30:09.219
(Electronic voice)
<i>System disarmed.</i>


551
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:10.453
Pardonnez-moi,
monsieur <i>swindell?</i>


552
00:30:10.455 --> 00:30:15.124
Uh, oh, that's just my
stupid alarm acting up.


553
00:30:15.126 --> 00:30:16.893
No... no big deal.

554
00:30:17.529 --> 00:30:20.296
Anton: <i>Of course,</i>
<i></i> <i>the alarms, right.</i>


555
00:30:20.298 --> 00:30:22.098
(Whispering)
What are you doing?


556
00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.200
<i>Well,</i> au revoir,
monsieur <i>swindell.</i>


557
00:30:24.202 --> 00:30:25.835
<i>I look forward</i>

558
00:30:25.837 --> 00:30:28.371
(Whispers)
Come on.
(Whispers)
What are you doing?


559
00:30:28.373 --> 00:30:29.839
(Whispering)
Explanations later. Go.


560
00:30:29.841 --> 00:30:33.276
Right back at you,
Mr. lefaver.


561
00:30:34.378 --> 00:30:35.845
Move.

562
00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:45.822
That was so close.

563
00:30:45.824 --> 00:30:47.724
Who turned off
that alarm?


564
00:30:47.726 --> 00:30:49.526
No idea.

565
00:30:50.461 --> 00:30:52.328
I did it.

566
00:30:53.965 --> 00:30:55.298
You saved us?

567
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.967
You hacked into
the security system?


568
00:30:57.969 --> 00:30:59.502
A little kid?

569
00:31:00.504 --> 00:31:02.805
Swindell's security
system is a joke,


570
00:31:02.807 --> 00:31:04.173
binary regressive code.

571
00:31:04.175 --> 00:31:06.142
Hacking that was child's play.

572
00:31:06.144 --> 00:31:07.577
I told you I could help.

573
00:31:07.579 --> 00:31:10.747
Thank you.
But you're not
joining us.


574
00:31:10.749 --> 00:31:12.815
I'll tell mom and dad.

575
00:31:12.817 --> 00:31:15.385
Wait. Wait.
Oh, she's your sister.


576
00:31:20.257 --> 00:31:22.692
Okay, you're in.

577
00:31:22.826 --> 00:31:24.260
Yes.

578
00:31:26.196 --> 00:31:26.729
Savannah: Guys!

579
00:31:26.731 --> 00:31:29.699
Oh, you guys,
swindell is on his way.


580
00:31:29.934 --> 00:31:32.435
He's coming from the...

581
00:31:33.805 --> 00:31:36.439
You already knew that, right?

582
00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:37.974
Yeah.

583
00:31:45.749 --> 00:31:48.184
You had the card
in your hand, Griffin,


584
00:31:48.186 --> 00:31:49.018
and then you put it back?

585
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.921
Yeah, man, hey,
why are we going
through all this trouble


586
00:31:51.923 --> 00:31:53.523
if you're just gonna choke?

587
00:31:53.525 --> 00:31:54.524
I had a better idea.

588
00:31:54.526 --> 00:31:56.092
Swindell would've known
exactly who took it.


589
00:31:56.094 --> 00:32:00.229
There's no way
you could sell it
to anybody anywhere.


590
00:32:10.307 --> 00:32:15.044
Griffin: We need to
get swindell to give us
the card, free and clear.


591
00:32:15.046 --> 00:32:17.246
If we can do that, then...

592
00:32:17.314 --> 00:32:19.716
Then we've pulled off
the ultimate swindle.


593
00:32:19.718 --> 00:32:20.984
Okay, dude, swindell's
not just gonna fork


594
00:32:20.986 --> 00:32:23.620
over the honus out
of the goodness
of his heart.


595
00:32:23.622 --> 00:32:25.722
It would seem most
out of character.


596
00:32:25.724 --> 00:32:26.456
What she said.

597
00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:28.291
Okay, look.
He's going to do it.


598
00:32:28.293 --> 00:32:32.562
It's all going to
happen at the lakeshore
hotel this Saturday.


599
00:32:32.564 --> 00:32:33.463
How?

600
00:32:33.465 --> 00:32:35.898
Ben, trust me.

601
00:32:38.936 --> 00:32:41.104
So, what's next?

602
00:32:42.006 --> 00:32:43.172
I have a new plan.

603
00:32:43.174 --> 00:32:46.175
Amanda, we are
gonna need you.


604
00:32:51.582 --> 00:32:52.415
<i>To make this plan work,</i>

605
00:32:52.417 --> 00:32:55.151
<i>we're gonna need</i>
<i></i> <i>something special,</i>


606
00:32:55.153 --> 00:32:58.421
<i>and I know just</i>
<i>where to get it.</i>


607
00:33:00.492 --> 00:33:03.593
I can't believe
I'm doing this.


608
00:33:04.495 --> 00:33:06.062
Be strong.

609
00:33:09.601 --> 00:33:11.567
(Sighs) Hey, Eddie.

610
00:33:12.937 --> 00:33:15.738
<i>You... you're Amanda Benson.</i>

611
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.141
The Amanda Benson.
Yeah.


612
00:33:18.143 --> 00:33:19.542
<i>This is unreal.</i>

613
00:33:19.544 --> 00:33:21.144
<i>It's like I'm in</i> the matrix.

614
00:33:21.146 --> 00:33:22.078
Unreal is right.

615
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.414
Amanda would never
crush on a geek.


616
00:33:24.416 --> 00:33:29.485
And yet, you harbor
a not-so-secret
crush on her, yes?


617
00:33:29.987 --> 00:33:31.454
And your point is?

618
00:33:32.223 --> 00:33:34.590
Amanda: <i>Hey, Eddie,</i>
<i></i> <i>can I come in?</i>


619
00:33:34.592 --> 00:33:35.892
<i>Absolutely.</i>

620
00:33:35.894 --> 00:33:38.127
Thanks.
(Grunting)


621
00:33:38.495 --> 00:33:43.166
Okay, all right,
wake me up when
it's time to motor.


622
00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:48.705
Or we could make
use of this time


623
00:33:48.707 --> 00:33:50.973
to review some basic
acting techniques.


624
00:33:50.975 --> 00:33:52.675
Oh, okay, yeah, totally.

625
00:33:52.677 --> 00:33:58.715
Uh, this is my
"I don't care what
you're saying" face.


626
00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:00.883
Is it convincing?

627
00:34:03.787 --> 00:34:05.822
Okay, then, you do that.

628
00:34:11.729 --> 00:34:14.964
Submitted for your
approval. (Chuckles)


629
00:34:18.602 --> 00:34:21.104
Welcome to my man cave.

630
00:34:21.472 --> 00:34:22.805
Huh?

631
00:34:23.741 --> 00:34:25.108
Wow.

632
00:34:25.809 --> 00:34:27.443
Geek heaven.
Griffin: <i>Excellent.</i>


633
00:34:27.445 --> 00:34:30.880
Griffin: Now find
something small,
rare, and valuable.


634
00:34:30.882 --> 00:34:33.449
I'm trying.
Pardon?


635
00:34:33.684 --> 00:34:37.487
I... I'm trying to...

636
00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:39.255
To take it all in.

637
00:34:39.257 --> 00:34:41.324
Well, let me impress.

638
00:34:41.326 --> 00:34:45.928
Check out
my authentic
klingon bat'leth.


639
00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:48.564
<i>Worf himself held this.</i>

640
00:34:48.566 --> 00:34:50.433
Oh, wow.
(Grunts)


641
00:34:50.435 --> 00:34:51.934
(Speaking klingon)
Okay.


642
00:34:51.936 --> 00:34:55.037
(Speaking klingon)
It's... that's...


643
00:34:55.439 --> 00:34:56.205
Is that klingon?

644
00:35:01.578 --> 00:35:03.045
Eddie: Oh, sorry.

645
00:35:03.047 --> 00:35:05.081
<i>Amanda, did I hurt you?</i>

646
00:35:05.083 --> 00:35:06.415
<i>Are you okay?</i>

647
00:35:06.417 --> 00:35:07.984
<i>Amanda?</i>

648
00:35:08.953 --> 00:35:11.954
Jeez, did I break
your glasses?


649
00:35:11.956 --> 00:35:12.522
No, no.

650
00:35:12.524 --> 00:35:15.057
I don't think they're
broken, are they?


651
00:35:15.726 --> 00:35:17.160
Are they?

652
00:35:17.394 --> 00:35:19.195
<i>Look okay to me.</i>

653
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.765
Amanda, we can hear you.
Can you hear us?


654
00:35:22.767 --> 00:35:25.902
Amanda: <i>I think they might</i>
<i></i> <i>be broken. Speak to me.</i>


655
00:35:25.904 --> 00:35:29.071
<i>Um, I am speaking to you.</i>

656
00:35:32.176 --> 00:35:33.442
The earpiece isn't working.

657
00:35:33.444 --> 00:35:35.278
She's completely
cut off from us.


658
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.813
Savannah: Ugh.

659
00:35:37.815 --> 00:35:40.716
Come on, come on.
Work!


660
00:35:40.718 --> 00:35:43.186
Amanda, are you okay?

661
00:35:43.353 --> 00:35:44.620
Um.

662
00:35:45.222 --> 00:35:46.923
Yeah.

663
00:35:46.925 --> 00:35:49.158
(Sighs) I'm fine.

664
00:35:55.566 --> 00:36:00.603
Amanda: <i>Hey, Eddie,</i>
<i>since we're alone</i>
<i>and nobody can see us,</i>


665
00:36:00.605 --> 00:36:02.839
<i>i have something</i>
<i></i> <i>to confess to you</i>


666
00:36:02.841 --> 00:36:07.543
that you can never,
ever tell anybody, okay?


667
00:36:08.345 --> 00:36:10.146
Melissa: Zooming in.

668
00:36:11.548 --> 00:36:13.783
I love...

669
00:36:13.785 --> 00:36:15.785
Me?
No.


670
00:36:16.253 --> 00:36:17.753
Ew.

671
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.390
<i>No, I love</i>

672
00:36:21.392 --> 00:36:22.758
your collection!

673
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.560
You've got it all.

674
00:36:24.562 --> 00:36:26.696
Are you kidding?

675
00:36:26.763 --> 00:36:28.664
Star phase metal jacket.

676
00:36:28.666 --> 00:36:31.467
Oh, cosmic Dan
number 26


677
00:36:31.469 --> 00:36:34.103
where they introduce
the stranger?


678
00:36:34.105 --> 00:36:36.706
Yeah.
(Chuckles)


679
00:36:37.775 --> 00:36:41.544
Ben Kenobi and darth vader
in their epic showdown.


680
00:36:41.546 --> 00:36:43.579
Wow.
Amazing.


681
00:36:45.116 --> 00:36:47.850
Are these real
<i>star trek</i> uniforms?


682
00:36:47.852 --> 00:36:51.220
Actor-worn,
original series.


683
00:36:51.222 --> 00:36:54.390
And Griffin bing
said you wouldn't
care about this stuff.


684
00:36:54.392 --> 00:36:55.925
What a dorkasaurus he is.

685
00:36:57.762 --> 00:37:01.564
That's some
hefty geekiness
Amanda's sporting.


686
00:37:02.467 --> 00:37:04.500
We got scammed.

687
00:37:04.768 --> 00:37:05.501
What?

688
00:37:05.503 --> 00:37:09.138
Amanda Benson
is a secret geek.


689
00:37:10.275 --> 00:37:11.841
No way.

690
00:37:11.975 --> 00:37:14.377
<i>A red-haired</i>
<i>captain cybertor.</i>


691
00:37:14.379 --> 00:37:17.046
Yeah. The blues
are a dime a dozen,


692
00:37:17.048 --> 00:37:19.315
but the reds are
an ultra-rare variant.


693
00:37:19.317 --> 00:37:20.182
Yeah, a factory mistake.

694
00:37:20.184 --> 00:37:22.752
Most were destroyed
before they were released
to the general public.


695
00:37:22.754 --> 00:37:25.955
Yeah, but a handful
slipped out, super rare.


696
00:37:25.957 --> 00:37:30.293
A red-haired
captain cybertor in mint
condition, it's worth...


697
00:37:30.295 --> 00:37:32.495
Both: $80,000.

698
00:37:32.497 --> 00:37:35.164
She is so hot. So hot.

699
00:37:35.166 --> 00:37:37.166
Just breathe,
Ben, breathe.


700
00:37:41.305 --> 00:37:43.372
Um, Eddie...
Careful.


701
00:37:43.374 --> 00:37:45.107
I have to borrow this.

702
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:46.108
It's just for a few days,

703
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:51.314
and I promise it'll
come back without
a red hair out of place.


704
00:37:51.715 --> 00:37:53.215
Please? I promise.

705
00:37:53.217 --> 00:37:55.685
I promise.
Just say yes.


706
00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:59.488
Okay, but you have
to promise me


707
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.757
one thing first.

708
00:38:02.092 --> 00:38:06.595
(Sighs) Well, guess
who has a date
with the nerd king.


709
00:38:07.532 --> 00:38:10.333
(Eddie singsong)
<i>I got a date with</i>
<i></i> <i>Amanda Benson.</i>


710
00:38:10.335 --> 00:38:11.834
What?

711
00:38:11.969 --> 00:38:13.436
We saw everything.

712
00:38:13.438 --> 00:38:15.638
The glasses stopped receiving,

713
00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.040
but they never
stopped transmitting.


714
00:38:18.042 --> 00:38:19.909
(Singsong) <i>I got a date</i>
<i>with Amanda Benson.</i>


715
00:38:19.911 --> 00:38:22.745
<i>I got a date with</i>
<i></i> <i>Amanda Benson.</i>


716
00:38:22.747 --> 00:38:24.880
<i>Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.</i>

717
00:38:24.882 --> 00:38:26.449
<i>I rule, yeah!</i>

718
00:38:27.418 --> 00:38:28.784
It's like
Donna Hernandez
doesn't even exist.


719
00:38:28.786 --> 00:38:33.422
And the second
prettiest girl in school
is actually a complete...


720
00:38:33.424 --> 00:38:35.024
Do not use the "g" word!

721
00:38:35.026 --> 00:38:36.826
Okay, when I moved
here three years ago,


722
00:38:36.828 --> 00:38:38.327
I worked hard
to remake myself.


723
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:40.363
I will not go back to
being Mandy the mutant.


724
00:38:40.365 --> 00:38:42.865
Kids: (Chanting)
Mandy the mutant!


725
00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:48.404
Mandy the mutant!

726
00:38:50.274 --> 00:38:51.507
Mandy the
mutant, okay.


727
00:38:51.509 --> 00:38:52.108
Oh, shut up!

728
00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.976
If any of you
breathes a word of
this to anybody,


729
00:38:53.978 --> 00:38:57.546
I will hurt you in
ways that haven't
even been invented yet.


730
00:38:57.548 --> 00:38:59.849
Oh.
So hot.


731
00:38:59.851 --> 00:39:01.384
Ugh!

732
00:39:04.488 --> 00:39:05.855
Ugh!

733
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.928
Griffin: <i>Okay, we have</i>
<i></i> <i>a lot to do to get ready.</i>


734
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.696
<i>We know our target.</i>

735
00:39:13.698 --> 00:39:16.132
<i>The Internet is filled</i>
<i></i> <i>with stories about this guy.</i>


736
00:39:16.134 --> 00:39:19.435
<i>From nice old ladies to</i>
<i>puppies, he's robbed them all.</i>


737
00:39:19.437 --> 00:39:21.303
Savannah: <i>Uh, Griffin,</i>
<i>how do you rob a puppy?</i>


738
00:39:21.305 --> 00:39:24.707
Griffin: <i>He found a way.</i>
<i>Look, the point is,</i>
<i>he is a bad guy,</i>


739
00:39:24.709 --> 00:39:26.976
<i>and it's time</i>
<i></i> <i>someone took him down.</i>


740
00:39:26.978 --> 00:39:29.278
<i>Once and for all.</i>

741
00:39:58.575 --> 00:40:00.242
Nope.

742
00:40:02.813 --> 00:40:03.712
Hmm?

743
00:40:03.714 --> 00:40:05.614
Mmm, better.

744
00:40:07.684 --> 00:40:09.018
Uh-huh!

745
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.553
Bull's-eye.

746
00:40:10.555 --> 00:40:13.322
Okay, now this might
be hard to get used to.


747
00:40:13.324 --> 00:40:15.157
Just take your time. Relax.

748
00:40:15.159 --> 00:40:16.025
Focus.
Uh-huh.


749
00:40:16.027 --> 00:40:17.359
Just think of what
you're doing.


750
00:40:17.361 --> 00:40:18.928
Whoo!
Okay, that's good.


751
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.364
Why didn't you tell me
how easy this was gonna be?


752
00:40:22.366 --> 00:40:24.100
Yeah, hmm.

753
00:40:24.102 --> 00:40:24.934
Amanda: This is so fun!

754
00:40:24.936 --> 00:40:27.736
Well, that's beginner's
luck, though.


755
00:40:28.905 --> 00:40:30.673
Hello, lakeshore hotel?

756
00:40:30.675 --> 00:40:34.076
Book me your finest room.

757
00:40:34.744 --> 00:40:36.178
How much?

758
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.647
How about your
second finest room?


759
00:40:39.549 --> 00:40:40.316
Yeah.

760
00:40:40.318 --> 00:40:43.085
That's... okay,
that's a lot of backflips.


761
00:40:43.788 --> 00:40:46.956
You seem like you
have the hang of this.


762
00:40:46.958 --> 00:40:49.325
So I'm going to go.

763
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.927
I need this.

764
00:40:51.929 --> 00:40:53.863
Ha! No, you don't.

765
00:40:53.865 --> 00:40:56.332
Oh, yes, I do.

766
00:40:59.169 --> 00:41:02.438
Darren, are you ready
to embrace acting?


767
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.672
Ah, you mean pretending.

768
00:41:03.674 --> 00:41:04.807
It's a lot
more than that.
Okay.


769
00:41:04.809 --> 00:41:06.775
A lot more, okay,
you got it?
Okay.


770
00:41:06.777 --> 00:41:07.910
Ready?
Yeah.


771
00:41:07.912 --> 00:41:10.012
I'm a bird.
What am I now?


772
00:41:10.014 --> 00:41:11.113
You're holding your
arm up in the air.


773
00:41:11.115 --> 00:41:14.083
No. But it's a tree.
Feel the emotions,
though.


774
00:41:14.085 --> 00:41:15.985
Uh, what do you
want me to...


775
00:41:15.987 --> 00:41:17.887
I'm big.
Uh, I'm tiny.


776
00:41:17.889 --> 00:41:20.556
I'm sad.
You're a dork.


777
00:41:29.834 --> 00:41:33.202
Oh, what are you doing?
Blowing my mind is
what you're doing.


778
00:41:33.204 --> 00:41:34.436
Southern, Southern accent.

779
00:41:34.438 --> 00:41:36.338
Oh, we're Southern,
some cheese puffs.


780
00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.506
Chubbin'.
Cha!


781
00:41:37.508 --> 00:41:38.440
Chubbin'.
Chubbin'.


782
00:41:38.442 --> 00:41:43.245
Are you...
Are you okay?
(Sobbing)
No! I'm sad.


783
00:41:45.116 --> 00:41:46.582
I'm angry!
Okay.


784
00:41:46.584 --> 00:41:47.216
I'm so mad!

785
00:41:47.218 --> 00:41:48.984
Yeah, I'm so mad!
I'm so mad!


786
00:41:48.986 --> 00:41:51.320
Oh, we're shy.
Oh, be shy.


787
00:41:52.557 --> 00:41:54.089
Shy.
Your shy is amazing.


788
00:41:54.091 --> 00:41:55.090
I did it.
Your shy is fantastic.


789
00:41:55.092 --> 00:41:57.026
What?
It makes who you are.
It makes you vulnerable.


790
00:41:57.028 --> 00:41:59.161
That just happened
right there.
That just happened.


791
00:41:59.163 --> 00:42:00.796
I felt that.

792
00:42:12.643 --> 00:42:14.443
Okay, we're ready.

793
00:42:14.445 --> 00:42:17.246
Let's swindle a swindler.

794
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.224
Wow.

795
00:42:28.226 --> 00:42:30.159
Yeah, "wow" is the word.

796
00:42:30.695 --> 00:42:33.429
What a beautiful ride
from the country, huh?


797
00:42:33.431 --> 00:42:35.698
Nature is so chic. Ha!

<i>Allons-y!</i>

799
00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:50.379

800
00:42:51.514 --> 00:42:53.482
Panic attack.
Let's go.


801
00:42:53.484 --> 00:42:55.217
Darren.
On it.


802
00:42:59.155 --> 00:43:02.825
Guys, look, this is nuts.
We can't pull this off.


803
00:43:05.195 --> 00:43:06.862
You guys roll out.

804
00:43:12.769 --> 00:43:14.837
Ben, we got this, okay?

805
00:43:14.839 --> 00:43:15.571
Trust me.

<i>Melissa and Savannah</i>

807

This hotel is stupid
easy to hack.


808
00:43:23.581 --> 00:43:26.315
Hello! Firewall, anybody?

809
00:43:26.317 --> 00:43:29.952
Okay, duplicate reservation.

810
00:43:30.954 --> 00:43:32.721
Downgrade.

811
00:43:32.956 --> 00:43:35.557
And give me an "a."

812
00:43:37.927 --> 00:43:39.728
Upgrade.

813
00:43:42.032 --> 00:43:43.866
And done.

814
00:43:55.545 --> 00:43:59.315
Paula swindell.
My daddy booked
me a room here.


815
00:44:00.083 --> 00:44:00.916
Yes, miss swindell.

816
00:44:00.918 --> 00:44:04.787
Uh, "swindle,"
accent on the front half.


817
00:44:05.322 --> 00:44:08.223
My apologies,
miss swindle.


818
00:44:09.592 --> 00:44:13.028
Yes, I've got you
in the ultra-deluxe

Oh, "only the best
for my baby."


820
00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:18.100
That's what daddy
always says.


821
00:44:18.102 --> 00:44:20.035
Keep it on his card.

822
00:44:20.103 --> 00:44:21.570
Okay.

823
00:44:26.276 --> 00:44:28.744
See, Ben,
everything's
gonna be fine.


824
00:44:28.746 --> 00:44:30.679
No one knows us here.

825
00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:32.281
Except for my dad.

826
00:44:33.651 --> 00:44:34.883
Dad: A laser hedge
trimmer. Wow.


827
00:44:34.885 --> 00:44:36.885
The <i>snake pit's</i>
<i>really gonna</i>
<i>love that one.</i>


828
00:44:36.887 --> 00:44:38.554
Now, I call mine
the igot it.


829
00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:46.562
Of course,
this is just a prototype.


830
00:44:46.564 --> 00:44:48.097
Uh, it still has
a few bugs...


831
00:44:48.099 --> 00:44:52.101
The production models
won't be quite so sensitive.


832
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:54.737
Oh. (Laughs)

833
00:44:54.739 --> 00:44:56.071
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch anything.


834
00:44:56.073 --> 00:44:58.841
Call maintenance, okay?
Get someone...
Get 'em on the phone.


835
00:44:58.843 --> 00:45:01.710
That... that was me.
Did... did I do that?


836
00:45:01.712 --> 00:45:04.079
Yes, I think you did.

837
00:45:05.048 --> 00:45:07.616
Look, Griffin.
We haven't even started,


838
00:45:07.618 --> 00:45:09.585
and it's already not fine.

839
00:45:09.587 --> 00:45:11.754
The <i>snake pit</i> is here.

840
00:45:11.756 --> 00:45:13.455
My dad is here.

841
00:45:13.457 --> 00:45:15.924
Look... I'm going home.

842
00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:17.025
Uh-uh. No, you're not,

843
00:45:17.027 --> 00:45:21.330
'cause if you go home,
home will be Uncle
grover's barn in Montana.


844
00:45:21.332 --> 00:45:23.165
You need that card, Ben.

845
00:45:23.167 --> 00:45:26.568
All right, your family,
they need that money,


846
00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.537
'cause tough truth time,

847
00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:30.172
your dad's not gonna
sell the igot it.


848
00:45:30.174 --> 00:45:34.643
I just have to work
out a few bugs.
Okay, it'll be fine.


849
00:45:35.345 --> 00:45:36.111
He still can.

850
00:45:36.113 --> 00:45:38.881
He's just got to
work out a few bugs.


851
00:45:39.015 --> 00:45:40.783
Darren: Hey, guys.

852
00:45:40.785 --> 00:45:42.217
Watch this.

853
00:45:42.219 --> 00:45:42.684
Pull me.

854
00:45:42.686 --> 00:45:46.422
Yeah, that's right.
Ugh, I can't...
I can't... ugh.


855
00:45:51.294 --> 00:45:53.362
This place is bigger
than my house.


856
00:45:53.364 --> 00:45:55.898
Yeah, it must
cost a fortune.


857
00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.433
Oh, that's mine.
Thank you.


858
00:45:57.435 --> 00:45:58.100
Here you go.

859
00:45:58.102 --> 00:45:59.568
Griffin: It does, and if you
listen carefully,


860
00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:02.638
you can hear the whimper
of swindell's credit card.


861
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.506
(Clicks tongue)
Thank you.


862
00:46:04.508 --> 00:46:06.475
Hey, guys, guys,
TV in the bathroom.


863
00:46:06.477 --> 00:46:09.178
You can totally watch
a game while you're
taking a massive...


864
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.045
Please don't say it.

865
00:46:10.047 --> 00:46:12.114
No, bath, bath.
I was gonna say bath.


866
00:46:12.116 --> 00:46:15.751
Ugh, hon, hon,
daddy's on a strict
stinky cheese


867
00:46:15.753 --> 00:46:16.585
and raw squid diet.

868
00:46:16.587 --> 00:46:19.555
I know. Don't get me started.
The doctor calls it holistic.


869
00:46:19.557 --> 00:46:20.355
I call it horrific.

870
00:46:20.357 --> 00:46:22.458
Anyway, just send
that down as soon
as he checks in


871
00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.894
and charge it to the room.
Thanks, doll.


872
00:46:26.596 --> 00:46:27.396
Was I loathsome enough?

873
00:46:27.398 --> 00:46:30.132
You made me hate you.
You're so sweet.


874
00:46:30.134 --> 00:46:32.000
Hey, Griffin, can we
talk about your plan?


875
00:46:32.002 --> 00:46:33.702
You still think
it's crazy.
Well, yes, and...


876
00:46:33.704 --> 00:46:37.773
And you're afraid
you're gonna mess it up.
Well, yes.


877
00:46:37.775 --> 00:46:38.707
Ben, your job is key,

878
00:46:38.709 --> 00:46:41.710
and you're gonna
do fine, okay?
Can you trust me?


879
00:46:41.712 --> 00:46:43.445
I know, and I do.

880
00:46:43.447 --> 00:46:44.813
It's just, a lot's
riding on this,


881
00:46:44.815 --> 00:46:46.615
and nothing's
more important
to me right now...


882
00:46:46.617 --> 00:46:47.616
(Gasps)
The shield of barradon!

From <i>star smash 2,</i>

884
00:46:49.386 --> 00:46:53.222
Yeah, they're auctioning it
off here today, and I...


885
00:46:53.224 --> 00:46:54.089
Well, I thought...

886
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:56.992
I mean, I thought
you might want to know


887
00:46:56.994 --> 00:47:01.196
since that's your kind
of thing, not mine.


888
00:47:02.633 --> 00:47:04.733
Your shoes are
in the room.
Amanda: Thank you.


889
00:47:04.735 --> 00:47:06.535
Darren, we have
backstories to review.


890
00:47:06.537 --> 00:47:09.371
Okay, well, we already
did that, like, 300 times.


891
00:47:09.373 --> 00:47:12.941
Darren, acting is
where inspiration
meets preparation.


892
00:47:12.943 --> 00:47:14.009
Okay, okay,
well, we can...


893
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:16.411
We can prepare
while I'm watching
the game.


894
00:47:16.413 --> 00:47:19.648
I suppose, if that
works for you,
then we'll...


895
00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.920
Maybe we've prepared enough.

896
00:47:24.922 --> 00:47:27.789
I'll never get that
out of my head.


897
00:47:27.791 --> 00:47:30.325
Did you finally get
your gear in gear?


898
00:47:30.327 --> 00:47:32.361
Finally? It took me
less than five minutes,


899
00:47:32.363 --> 00:47:35.697
and it's way more
complicated than
anything you're doing.


900
00:47:35.699 --> 00:47:38.033
Okay, show me what you got.

901
00:47:38.035 --> 00:47:41.937
Melissa: Tapping into
the hotel surveillance cams.


902
00:47:41.939 --> 00:47:46.241
Lefevre has just
entered his room, and...


903
00:47:50.014 --> 00:47:53.282
Swindell's close.
He should be here in 10.


904
00:47:53.416 --> 00:47:54.750
Not bad, sis.

905
00:47:54.752 --> 00:47:58.820
Amanda, time for
your visit with
<i>monsieur</i> Lefevre.


906
00:47:58.822 --> 00:48:00.455

910
00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:12.034
Darren: I'm exfoliating!

911
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:22.544
Uh, good day.

915
00:48:29.286 --> 00:48:31.453
with the unfortunate hair.

916

Hey.

Don't scratch it.

920

Excuse-en, sir,

921
00:48:52.242 --> 00:48:54.343
but you are here
for der auction.


922
00:48:54.345 --> 00:48:57.646
We are looking
for <i>monsieur</i> Lefevre.


923
00:48:58.047 --> 00:48:59.948
Don't know where he is.

924
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.383
We're coming here
to sell papa's toy.


925
00:49:01.385 --> 00:49:03.885
We were told
it was vorth
a lot of monies.


926
00:49:03.887 --> 00:49:05.921
Ya, monies.

927
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.158
Vorth... worth a lot
of money, you say?


928
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.427
Mmm-hmm. Look-en.

929
00:49:18.001 --> 00:49:19.635
Ya.

930
00:49:20.269 --> 00:49:22.671
Oh, a red-haired
captain cybertor.


931
00:49:22.673 --> 00:49:26.875
Ya, is it vorth
the monies?
Uh, monies.


932
00:49:27.243 --> 00:49:30.946
Well... (Stutters)
It would be,


933
00:49:30.948 --> 00:49:34.149
if the hair was blue.

934
00:49:34.151 --> 00:49:36.251
Blue?
Swindell: Yeah. Oh, yeah.


935
00:49:36.253 --> 00:49:37.619
The blue ones are super rare,

936
00:49:37.621 --> 00:49:40.222
but yours is red,
unfortunately.


937
00:49:40.224 --> 00:49:42.557
Red.
Swindell: Oh, yeah, red.


938
00:49:42.559 --> 00:49:44.926
Yeah, the red ones
are a dime a dozen,


939
00:49:44.928 --> 00:49:46.662
almost worthless.

940
00:49:46.896 --> 00:49:47.462
You know,

941
00:49:47.464 --> 00:49:52.701
I wouldn't waste
Mr. Lefevre's
time with this.


942
00:49:52.703 --> 00:49:54.302
Oh.

943
00:49:55.204 --> 00:49:56.405
Monies?

944
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:04.112
Okay, now just a little more.

945
00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:09.017
Now, we just, um, wait for
the rejuvenating agents


946
00:50:09.019 --> 00:50:13.221
to, um... to rejuvenate.

947
00:50:13.223 --> 00:50:15.290
Rejuvenate...
Ah, ah, ah, ah.


948
00:50:15.292 --> 00:50:18.260
No talking.
No moving.


949
00:50:18.695 --> 00:50:20.328
There you go.
(Whimpers)


950
00:50:30.206 --> 00:50:32.474
Red, worthless.

951
00:50:32.575 --> 00:50:33.942
Vorthless?

952
00:50:33.944 --> 00:50:36.178
Yeah, worthless.

953
00:50:36.779 --> 00:50:37.412
Floogin.

954
00:50:37.414 --> 00:50:41.349
(Groans)
Jorgen has der
disappointment.


955
00:50:41.351 --> 00:50:44.886
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I understand, yeah. Ugh.


956
00:50:44.888 --> 00:50:46.755
You know,
I like you kids.


957
00:50:46.757 --> 00:50:49.891
I hate to see you
go home empty-handed.


958
00:50:50.626 --> 00:50:53.795
How about I take
that off your hand


959
00:50:53.797 --> 00:50:57.432
for, say, oh, 10 bucks.

960
00:50:57.434 --> 00:50:59.768
(Gasps)
How's that sound?


961
00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:03.105
Oh, 10 American dollars.

962
00:51:03.107 --> 00:51:04.106
Ah, monies.

963
00:51:04.108 --> 00:51:07.008
Oh.
Yeah, monies, eh?


964
00:51:09.379 --> 00:51:11.146
Suckers.

965
00:51:20.156 --> 00:51:22.924
So, I pretty much
rocked that, right?


966
00:51:22.926 --> 00:51:26.094
Well, your accent
was iffy, and maybe
if you could just...


967
00:51:26.096 --> 00:51:28.597
Rocked it.
(Chuckles)


968
00:51:31.033 --> 00:51:33.101
I booked a room.

969
00:51:33.836 --> 00:51:35.670
Yes, Mr. swindle.

970
00:51:35.672 --> 00:51:37.706
Oh, "swindell."

971
00:51:58.995 --> 00:52:00.162
This is my room?

972
00:52:00.164 --> 00:52:02.964
Well, you get
what you pay for.


973
00:52:05.368 --> 00:52:06.768
Oh, what's that smell?

974
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.336
Yeah.

975
00:52:10.007 --> 00:52:13.675
Your stinky cheese
and squid plate,


976
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.577
as requested.

977
00:52:21.551 --> 00:52:23.251
(Scoffs) No.

978
00:52:34.197 --> 00:52:35.530
Here we go.

979
00:52:37.734 --> 00:52:41.770
My, my, look
how you glow.


980
00:52:44.274 --> 00:52:48.844
(Sighs) I look like
the bottom of a baby.


981
00:52:48.846 --> 00:52:49.477
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

982
00:52:49.479 --> 00:52:51.346
Oh, you're very
welcome, Mr. Lefevre.


983
00:52:51.348 --> 00:52:53.582
All a part of the
lakeshore hotel touch.


984
00:52:53.584 --> 00:52:55.317
(Sighs) You are an angel.

985
00:52:55.319 --> 00:52:56.151
Amanda: Okay, all right.

986
00:52:56.153 --> 00:52:59.054
Please, look at
my skin. Worship me.


987
00:52:59.056 --> 00:53:00.522
I am beautiful.

988
00:53:00.524 --> 00:53:01.690
Please, touch Lefevre.

989
00:53:01.692 --> 00:53:04.860
Oh, yes.
Oh, I'm beautiful.


990
00:53:04.862 --> 00:53:06.494
Swindell took the bait.

991
00:53:06.496 --> 00:53:07.929
Jah, bonus!

992
00:53:07.931 --> 00:53:09.331
Time to celebrate.

993
00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:10.799
Hello, room service?

994
00:53:10.801 --> 00:53:12.334
Yes, I'd like six...
Two.


995
00:53:12.336 --> 00:53:14.703
Eight hamburgers,
four pizzas,


996
00:53:14.705 --> 00:53:17.205
and what desserts
do you have?


997
00:53:17.207 --> 00:53:18.773
Anybody else need anything?

998
00:53:18.775 --> 00:53:19.574
Nothing for me, sis,

999
00:53:19.576 --> 00:53:22.944
but I could really use
a massage of ze foot.


1000
00:53:22.946 --> 00:53:24.813
Ben: Awesome.
(Sighs)


1001
00:53:24.815 --> 00:53:27.616
Whoa, he looks
exactly like "le-fever."


1002
00:53:27.618 --> 00:53:28.416
Ugh, Lefevre.

1003
00:53:28.418 --> 00:53:29.417
Nah, I don't care.
Yeah, I do.


1004
00:53:29.419 --> 00:53:31.620
Yeah, just add
six sundaes,
please, thanks.


1005
00:53:31.622 --> 00:53:33.388
Amanda, that's amazing.

1006
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:34.155
Thank you.
(Laughs)


1007
00:53:34.157 --> 00:53:37.225
It's just some
concealer and
some blush


1008
00:53:37.227 --> 00:53:39.661
and a metric ton of putty.

1009
00:53:42.098 --> 00:53:43.365
Is that nose gonna hold?

1010
00:53:43.367 --> 00:53:46.902
It only needs to work
for a few minutes.


1011
00:54:32.515 --> 00:54:33.214
Hey, captain.

1012
00:54:33.216 --> 00:54:36.084
You look like you're
worth a lot of cash.


1013
00:54:36.086 --> 00:54:37.953
Not as much as you, honus.

1014
00:54:44.126 --> 00:54:45.627
Yeah?

1015
00:54:45.861 --> 00:54:48.563
Spa day with Mr. Lefevre?

1016
00:54:49.231 --> 00:54:50.465
His treat?

1017
00:54:50.467 --> 00:54:53.268
All right, yeah,
I'll be right there.


1018
00:54:53.636 --> 00:54:54.336
Things are looking up.

1019
00:54:54.338 --> 00:54:57.505
The spa's on the
second floor. Enjoy.


1020
00:54:57.507 --> 00:55:00.208
Swindell's on the move.
You're already late.


1021
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:03.211
I move at a relaxed pace.

1022
00:55:03.213 --> 00:55:06.247
Whatever.
I'll buy you
a few minutes.


1023
00:55:06.249 --> 00:55:07.949
<i>Au revoir,</i> everyone.

1024
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:09.951
Good luck!
Bye!


1025
00:55:16.626 --> 00:55:17.525
Going up.

1026
00:55:25.935 --> 00:55:27.936
And going down.

1027
00:55:28.872 --> 00:55:31.573
And going
up again.
(Yells)


1028
00:55:31.575 --> 00:55:34.576
And then down.
(Beeping)


1029
00:55:36.646 --> 00:55:39.047
And up.

1030
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:40.115
And down.

1031
00:55:40.117 --> 00:55:43.385
And up again.
(Swindell yelling)


1032
00:55:48.625 --> 00:55:50.191
<i>And up.</i>
<i>Ooh!</i>


1033
00:55:50.193 --> 00:55:52.494
Hey, why not?
Let's go down.


1034
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:08.443
Help!

1035
00:56:08.677 --> 00:56:11.046
Help!
(All chuckling)


1036
00:56:14.117 --> 00:56:16.151
Do up again.

1037
00:56:18.255 --> 00:56:20.622
Swindell: <i>Oh, ow!</i>

1038
00:56:21.924 --> 00:56:23.925
Griffin: <i>You know what,</i>
<i></i> <i>Melissa?</i>


1039
00:56:23.927 --> 00:56:25.593
I'll say it.
I am impressed.


1040
00:56:25.595 --> 00:56:30.198
You are the most
dangerous girl
in the seventh grade.


1041
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.933
Aw, thanks, bro.

1042
00:56:31.935 --> 00:56:34.135
<i>Bonjour,</i> madame.

1043
00:56:36.039 --> 00:56:39.808
(Crying)
Somebody stop this thing!


1044
00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:49.184
Ah, Mr. swindell.

1045
00:56:49.285 --> 00:56:52.487
I have your squid
and limburger sandwich.


1046
00:56:57.394 --> 00:56:59.160
Uh-uh... no.

1047
00:56:59.162 --> 00:57:01.996
Ew. I'm done.
(Chuckles)


1048
00:57:03.599 --> 00:57:07.268
Griffin: (In a French accent)
Ah, <i>monsieur</i> swindell,
come, join me, please.


1049
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:12.073
Oh, hey,
Mr. Lefevre,
is that you?


1050
00:57:12.075 --> 00:57:12.740
Griffin: But of course.

1051
00:57:12.742 --> 00:57:16.811
Could there be
two such noses
as this in the world?


1052
00:57:16.813 --> 00:57:19.180
(Chuckling)
Oh, I guess not.


1053
00:57:19.182 --> 00:57:21.382
Oh, please, lie down.

1054
00:57:21.384 --> 00:57:22.817
Oh, okay.

1055
00:57:22.819 --> 00:57:24.819
You are in for
a treat, <i>mon ami.</i>


1056
00:57:24.821 --> 00:57:29.891
I have requested for you
my favorite masseuse.


1057
00:57:29.893 --> 00:57:32.127
Swindell: (Sighing)
Oh, nice, 'cause I actually


1058
00:57:32.129 --> 00:57:33.761
have been feeling
a little tight.


1059
00:57:33.763 --> 00:57:36.731
A massage
will feel real nice.


1060
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:43.138
I know,
fantastic, <i>non?</i>


1061
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:45.773
Griffin: She is a master
with the muscle.


1062
00:57:46.543 --> 00:57:49.310
Yeah, you know,
I can honestly say...


1063
00:57:49.312 --> 00:57:50.678
(Groaning) Oh!

1064
00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.082
I've never felt
anything like it.


1065
00:58:01.357 --> 00:58:03.291
Swindell: Oh!

1066
00:58:04.727 --> 00:58:05.894
Wait a second.
His nose.


1067
00:58:05.896 --> 00:58:08.229
Oh, no,
this is all
going South.


1068
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:09.030
Hey, mayday, mayday.

1069
00:58:09.032 --> 00:58:11.199
Pull out. Pull out.
Your nose is melting.


1070
00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:14.869
I'm working here.
Abort mission.


1071
00:58:15.137 --> 00:58:16.804
Ow. Well, now
I'm in pain.


1072
00:58:16.806 --> 00:58:19.207
Mayday, I'm in pain.
My head hurts.


1073
00:58:19.209 --> 00:58:21.109
Abort mission.

1074
00:58:21.343 --> 00:58:21.743
Ow.

1075
00:58:21.745 --> 00:58:24.312
Thank you.
I'm feeling
less hysterical now.


1076
00:58:24.314 --> 00:58:25.713
Stick to the plan.

1077
00:58:25.715 --> 00:58:27.982
Amanda, time for your date.

1078
00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:30.118
On it.

1079
00:58:30.719 --> 00:58:32.220
Oh.

1080
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:35.924
Whoa.
You look really good in black.


1081
00:58:35.926 --> 00:58:38.960
You should
wear it more often.


1082
00:58:41.263 --> 00:58:42.697
Thanks.

1083
00:58:42.865 --> 00:58:45.066
That's really sweet
of you and um,


1084
00:58:45.068 --> 00:58:47.869
kind of awkward.

1085
00:58:50.839 --> 00:58:52.974
I think she likes me.

1086
00:58:52.976 --> 00:58:54.842
(Mouthing) No.

1087
00:58:55.444 --> 00:58:57.312
Uh-oh, Lefevre is
leaving his room.


1088
00:58:57.314 --> 00:58:59.414
No, well, if swindell
sees him, we're done.


1089
00:58:59.416 --> 00:59:00.782
If he sees Griffin,
we're worse.


1090
00:59:00.784 --> 00:59:04.152
Excellent time
for improvisational theater.


1091
00:59:04.286 --> 00:59:05.320
Come on, Darren.

1092
00:59:05.322 --> 00:59:06.187
Wait. Wait.
Who's my character?


1093
00:59:06.189 --> 00:59:09.557
No, no, wait,
wait, wait, hey, hey.
What's my backstory?


1094
00:59:11.894 --> 00:59:14.229
Ooh, this
should be good.


1095
00:59:14.231 --> 00:59:17.932
Donald p. Luddler,
I have never been
so angry in all my life.


1096
00:59:17.934 --> 00:59:21.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's this, what's
this all about, Darlene?


1097
00:59:21.171 --> 00:59:22.870
I saw you
with that girl
by the pool!


1098
00:59:22.872 --> 00:59:25.440
You should have whiplash
the way you were
taking her curves.


1099
00:59:25.442 --> 00:59:27.308
(Stuttering)
No, I swear. I swear.


1100
00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:29.978
I didn't even notice
her or her curves.


1101
00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.879
(Groans)
Oh!


1102
00:59:36.485 --> 00:59:38.987
Why?
We're acting.
Just stay in the moment.


1103
00:59:38.989 --> 00:59:42.023
Just stay
in the moment.
(Elevator dings)


1104
00:59:43.792 --> 00:59:45.126
You are such a liar!

1105
00:59:45.128 --> 00:59:46.928
No, no, I am not.

1106
00:59:47.664 --> 00:59:49.464
This elevator
is not going anywhere
until you admit it.


1107
00:59:49.466 --> 00:59:53.635
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i> I have
a very important auction,
and I must...


1108
00:59:53.637 --> 00:59:55.970
Both:
You stay out of this!


1109
01:00:24.533 --> 01:00:26.634
Amanda: <i>Hooked in.</i>

1110
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:28.369
Sending you
the call now.


1111
01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:30.171
(Phone ringing)
Griffin: Oh...


1112
01:00:30.173 --> 01:00:33.641
(In French accent)
This man will not
leave me alone.


1113
01:00:33.809 --> 01:00:36.144
What man?

1114
01:00:36.146 --> 01:00:40.048
Ivan volkov,
big spender,


1115
01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:40.915
big collector.

1116
01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:43.685
Been searching
for years for
the same item.


1117
01:00:43.687 --> 01:00:48.289
A red-haired
captain cybertor figure.


1118
01:00:48.724 --> 01:00:50.725
Oh, really?
(Grunts)


1119
01:00:50.727 --> 01:00:53.695
Griffin:
I had one all lined up,
but alas,


1120
01:00:53.697 --> 01:00:56.064
the sellers,
they never arrived.


1121
01:00:56.066 --> 01:00:58.866
Oh, ha, ha.
Those things happen.


1122
01:00:58.868 --> 01:00:59.567
Oh!

1123
01:00:59.569 --> 01:01:01.569
Yes, but
he keeps calling me.


1124
01:01:01.571 --> 01:01:04.906
I do not like
disappointing a man
like volkov.


1125
01:01:04.908 --> 01:01:08.609
He is, how you say,
a ruthless man.


1126
01:01:08.611 --> 01:01:13.881
One cannot overstate
the gravity of...


1127
01:01:13.883 --> 01:01:16.150
Of the gravity...

1128
01:01:16.152 --> 01:01:20.221
(Clears throat)
The gravity of...


1129
01:01:22.225 --> 01:01:26.461
Mayday, mayday, pull out.
Mission abort.


1130
01:01:27.563 --> 01:01:30.098
Um...

1131
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:37.338
Whew!

1132
01:01:42.811 --> 01:01:44.812
I'm in.
Acknowledged.


1133
01:01:44.814 --> 01:01:48.649
You'll never catch
Donna Hernandez
doing this.


1134
01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.854
Um...

1135
01:01:52.856 --> 01:01:56.090
Swindell:
<i>Uh, Mr. Lefevre,</i>
<i></i> <i>you okay there?</i>


1136
01:01:56.092 --> 01:01:59.060
Griffin: (Chuckles)
<i>Uh, yes, yes,</i>
<i></i> <i>I'm quite all right.</i>


1137
01:01:59.062 --> 01:02:02.196
Oh, no, you're not.
Yes, I am.


1138
01:02:02.198 --> 01:02:03.698
It's just, uh, uh...

1139
01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.667
My allergies
seem to be
bothering me.


1140
01:02:10.439 --> 01:02:13.174
Lie still!
(Sobbing)


1141
01:02:13.176 --> 01:02:16.844
All he ever does
is criticize me.
Okay, oh.


1142
01:02:16.846 --> 01:02:20.114
He thinks my dreams
of becoming an actress
are stupid.


1143
01:02:20.116 --> 01:02:21.983
Hug me.
I want a hug.


1144
01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:24.719
What?
I, I never said that.


1145
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:25.353
I never did.

1146
01:02:25.355 --> 01:02:27.422
Oh, you know what?
You didn't have to.


1147
01:02:27.424 --> 01:02:30.725
Oh, the hillbillies...

1148
01:02:36.966 --> 01:02:40.301
Oh, look at the time.
So much to do.


1149
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:43.404
Oh, thank you.

1150
01:02:43.406 --> 01:02:46.541
<i>Au revoir,</i> Mr. swindell.

1151
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:50.178
What? Hey, where you going?

1152
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.915
I said lie still!
(Groaning)


1153
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.384
Oh, maybe I can...
No, hey, stay!


1154
01:02:56.386 --> 01:02:58.553
He doesn't take acting
seriously at all.
It's just...


1155
01:02:58.555 --> 01:03:01.756
It's one big joke to you.
Yeah, I do,
I do joke around.


1156
01:03:01.758 --> 01:03:03.524
All right,
but I don't mean
nothing by it.


1157
01:03:03.526 --> 01:03:06.494
Well, it means
something to me.


1158
01:03:06.496 --> 01:03:10.932
It hurts, dar...
Donald, I mean.


1159
01:03:10.934 --> 01:03:13.000
You know,
ever think of that?


1160
01:03:13.002 --> 01:03:14.135
No, no, I didn't.

1161
01:03:14.137 --> 01:03:16.871
I never meant
to hurt you, Savannah...


1162
01:03:16.873 --> 01:03:18.139
Or Darlene,

1163
01:03:18.141 --> 01:03:21.309
and I promise that I will
never hurt you again.


1164
01:03:21.311 --> 01:03:23.945
Yes, yes, yes,
this is what you must do.


1165
01:03:23.947 --> 01:03:27.715
Just as I must attend
my auction.


1166
01:03:32.654 --> 01:03:34.388
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1167
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:35.523
Bye, now.

1168
01:03:35.525 --> 01:03:36.624
This acting thing
is kind of awesome!


1169
01:03:36.626 --> 01:03:40.661
See, a performance
can be a constructive outlet
for life's frustrations.


1170
01:03:40.663 --> 01:03:43.064
Yeah, yeah,
even more than
pounding things.


1171
01:03:43.066 --> 01:03:44.899
Mmm-hmm.

1172
01:03:46.068 --> 01:03:48.169
Ooh, went
smooth as glass.


1173
01:03:48.171 --> 01:03:49.036
Broken glass.

1174
01:03:49.038 --> 01:03:50.471
Well, it worked, anyway.

1175
01:03:50.473 --> 01:03:52.740
How's Amanda doing?
She's almost there.


1176
01:03:52.742 --> 01:03:53.875
All right. Ben!

1177
01:03:53.877 --> 01:03:56.911
Yep.
Oh, you're up.


1178
01:03:57.813 --> 01:03:59.881
Is the moustache working?

1179
01:04:00.415 --> 01:04:01.883
Overtime.

1180
01:04:01.885 --> 01:04:03.818
All right.

1181
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:11.158
Melissa: <i>Moustache,</i>
<i></i> <i>can you see him?</i>


1182
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.793
Yes.

1183
01:04:12.795 --> 01:04:13.528
Ben: Here he comes.

1184
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:15.930
Uh, no, no,
it was great.
I feel very loose.


1185
01:04:15.932 --> 01:04:17.932
(Laughing)
Here's my card.


1186
01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:19.934
Call me, maybe.

1187
01:04:19.936 --> 01:04:21.168
Thanks.
(Laughs)


1188
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:22.770
And drink
plenty of water.


1189
01:04:29.278 --> 01:04:30.311
Volkov: It's simple.

1190
01:04:30.313 --> 01:04:33.814
You get me red-haired
captain cybertor


1191
01:04:33.816 --> 01:04:36.117
or I break you!

1192
01:04:36.119 --> 01:04:38.386
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

1193
01:04:48.597 --> 01:04:50.798
Pardon me, Mr. volkov?

1194
01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.267
Nobody approaches.

1195
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:55.136
Keep walking,
little man.


1196
01:04:55.138 --> 01:04:57.805
Alexei, Boris, let go.

1197
01:04:57.807 --> 01:05:00.207
This little man is swindell.

1198
01:05:00.977 --> 01:05:05.179
Swindell, accent on
the back half, but...


1199
01:05:05.181 --> 01:05:07.281
(Stammers)
It and, you know, it...


1200
01:05:07.283 --> 01:05:09.884
Swindell's
with the Russian.


1201
01:05:09.886 --> 01:05:12.486
I see you on the tvs,
Mr. swindell.


1202
01:05:12.488 --> 01:05:14.922
Today, I buy your honus card.

1203
01:05:14.924 --> 01:05:16.223
Oh, great, great, yeah.

1204
01:05:16.225 --> 01:05:20.227
And actually,
I've come to talk to you
about another collectible.


1205
01:05:20.229 --> 01:05:20.962
(Clears throat)
I, uh...


1206
01:05:20.964 --> 01:05:25.433
I understand you're looking
for a red-haired
captain cybertor.


1207
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.001
<i>Da.</i>

1208
01:05:27.769 --> 01:05:30.071
Why?

1209
01:05:30.539 --> 01:05:31.339
You have?

1210
01:05:31.341 --> 01:05:34.775
Oh, yeah, I have.
I have. (Chuckles)


1211
01:05:34.777 --> 01:05:37.178
This is good, little man.

1212
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.245
Yeah.

1213
01:05:38.247 --> 01:05:40.414
Bring it to me.

1214
01:05:40.482 --> 01:05:41.716
Yeah.

1215
01:05:41.718 --> 01:05:43.684
I'll...

1216
01:05:46.555 --> 01:05:49.156
The weasel
has left the building.


1217
01:05:49.158 --> 01:05:49.624
Huh?

1218
01:05:49.626 --> 01:05:52.860
Swindell's on his way
back to his room.


1219
01:05:56.733 --> 01:05:59.400
Oh, not doing that again.

1220
01:05:59.402 --> 01:06:02.103
Uh...
(Elevator dings)


1221
01:06:10.412 --> 01:06:11.379
How's she doing?

1222
01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:13.648
Amanda,
where are you?
I'm in swindell's room.


1223
01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:17.752
Well, make the switch.
Swindell's coming
your way fast.


1224
01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:26.027
Move it! (Chuckles)

1225
01:06:27.429 --> 01:06:30.064
Amanda:
Hello, handsome.


1226
01:06:32.267 --> 01:06:33.801
(Beeping)
Say cheese.


1227
01:06:40.776 --> 01:06:42.543
(Scoffs) Show off.

1228
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.847
Amanda:
Making the switch.


1229
01:07:03.865 --> 01:07:07.702
Swindell: (Chuckling)
You'll make me a rich man.


1230
01:07:25.087 --> 01:07:28.756
Woman: Welcome to
the <i>snake pit,</i> sir.
And your name?


1231
01:07:28.758 --> 01:07:29.824
Ben, what's your status?

1232
01:07:29.826 --> 01:07:32.259
Waiting for the weasel
to join the bar mitzvah.


1233
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:35.229
What?
Waiting for swindell
to return.


1234
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:44.371
He's never gonna sell
that thing.


1235
01:07:54.015 --> 01:07:58.519
(Clears throat)
One red-haired
captain cybertor


1236
01:07:58.521 --> 01:08:00.087
in mint condition.

1237
01:08:01.357 --> 01:08:05.159
Eighty thousand
American dollars.


1238
01:08:08.131 --> 01:08:08.896
What?

1239
01:08:08.898 --> 01:08:11.565
You do not
trust Ivan volkov?


1240
01:08:11.567 --> 01:08:12.500
What?
Oh, no, no, no.


1241
01:08:12.502 --> 01:08:16.370
No, I was just,
you know,
just checking it out.


1242
01:08:16.738 --> 01:08:18.906
I am man of honor.

1243
01:08:18.908 --> 01:08:21.976
If I say there is $80,000,

1244
01:08:21.978 --> 01:08:24.745
there is $80,000.

1245
01:08:24.747 --> 01:08:26.313
Well, yeah, no,
yeah, yeah, absolutely.


1246
01:08:26.315 --> 01:08:30.451
I mean, no offense
intended, Mr. volkov.


1247
01:08:30.453 --> 01:08:33.120
I do not look in box
you give to me.


1248
01:08:33.122 --> 01:08:34.655
Do you know why?

1249
01:08:34.657 --> 01:08:36.357
Because, uh...

1250
01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.359
I'm a man of honor too?

1251
01:08:38.361 --> 01:08:39.627
No.
Oh.


1252
01:08:39.629 --> 01:08:42.863
Because last man
who tried to cheat
Ivan volkov...


1253
01:08:42.865 --> 01:08:46.500
Well, no one knows
what happened to him.
(Chuckles)


1254
01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:50.037
No one but me,
alexei, and Boris.


1255
01:08:50.039 --> 01:08:52.540
You understand, <i>da?</i>

1256
01:08:52.542 --> 01:08:55.810
<i>Da,</i> yeah, very <i>da.</i>

1257
01:08:56.044 --> 01:08:59.346
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. swindell.


1258
01:08:59.348 --> 01:09:02.650
I see you at auction later.

1259
01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:06.887
I buy your honus card, eh?

1260
01:09:10.725 --> 01:09:12.593
Oh.

1261
01:09:15.397 --> 01:09:16.096
Woman: Thank you.

1262
01:09:16.098 --> 01:09:19.934
Melissa: <i>Status, please.</i>
<i></i> <i>Is the deal done?</i>
<i>What?</i>


1263
01:09:20.335 --> 01:09:22.570
Oh, uh, oops.

1264
01:09:22.572 --> 01:09:27.341
I mean, uh, pardon
the, uh, the inconvenience.


1265
01:09:27.343 --> 01:09:29.343
Do I know you?

1266
01:09:29.345 --> 01:09:31.879
Uh, no. Mmm-mmm.

1267
01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:34.114
I, uh...

1268
01:09:34.116 --> 01:09:34.648
Ow!

1269
01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:37.484
You're the kid
with the honus card.


1270
01:09:37.986 --> 01:09:39.720
I see.

1271
01:09:39.855 --> 01:09:41.055
Squid, limburger.

1272
01:09:41.057 --> 01:09:43.757
You've been messing
with me all day.


1273
01:09:44.727 --> 01:09:47.361
Run away!

1274
01:10:07.515 --> 01:10:09.049
Swindell: Jackpot!

1275
01:10:09.051 --> 01:10:12.586
Who's the sucker
paying for this?


1276
01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:18.092
Aha!

1277
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.342
Ah, Mr. swindell,
we've been
waiting for you.


1278
01:11:08.344 --> 01:11:10.210
Oh, yeah?

1279
01:11:11.579 --> 01:11:13.747
Wait.
Monies?


1280
01:11:13.749 --> 01:11:14.815
You know, swindell,
you're actually


1281
01:11:14.817 --> 01:11:16.417
five minutes later
than we thought.


1282
01:11:16.419 --> 01:11:18.319
I can't believe
that plan worked.


1283
01:11:18.321 --> 01:11:19.053
Oh, wait, wait.

1284
01:11:19.055 --> 01:11:21.221
You intentionally
dropped your card?


1285
01:11:22.324 --> 01:11:23.324
What's going on here?

1286
01:11:23.326 --> 01:11:25.626
Funny story, um,
well, for us, anyway.


1287
01:11:25.628 --> 01:11:27.962
You know how you
just sold to Mr. volkov


1288
01:11:27.964 --> 01:11:30.164
a red-haired
captain cybertor?


1289
01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:34.601
Yeah.
You actually sold him
a regular old blue one.


1290
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:36.837
(Chuckling)
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no,


1291
01:11:36.839 --> 01:11:38.739
I sold him a red one.

1292
01:11:38.741 --> 01:11:40.975
You mean this one?

1293
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:45.679
(Stammering)
How did... how did...
That was in my...


1294
01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:47.381
Hello.

1295
01:11:47.383 --> 01:11:48.082
By the way, nice room.

1296
01:11:48.084 --> 01:11:51.218
Do you have any idea
what that crazy Russian
volkov's gonna do to me?


1297
01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:54.588
Yeah, I do,
pretty graphically,
actually.


1298
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:55.889
So here's
what's going to happen.


1299
01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:58.459
We'll give you this
red-haired captain cybertor,


1300
01:11:58.461 --> 01:12:01.028
and in return,
you give us...


1301
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:02.229
Free and clear.

1302
01:12:02.231 --> 01:12:04.431
The honus Wagner card.

1303
01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:06.567
Melissa: And you might
want to hurry,


1304
01:12:06.569 --> 01:12:10.237
'cause that crazy Russian
seems pretty angry.


1305
01:12:10.906 --> 01:12:14.241
Volkov: (Screaming)
<i>Where is swindell?</i>


1306
01:12:15.443 --> 01:12:17.478
<i>I break him!</i>

1307
01:12:17.712 --> 01:12:19.646
Oh, no,
this can't be happening.


1308
01:12:19.648 --> 01:12:23.350
It's over.
Now give us the card.


1309
01:12:24.419 --> 01:12:27.421
<i>I break him very much!</i>

1310
01:12:28.523 --> 01:12:31.258
(Whispering) Aw.
Ben: Face it, dude.


1311
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.927
You just got swindled.

1312
01:12:39.834 --> 01:12:42.036
Give me that!
Catch it!


1313
01:12:42.038 --> 01:12:43.904
Hey, hey.
There you go.


1314
01:12:43.906 --> 01:12:46.573
Come on!
Catch!


1315
01:12:46.975 --> 01:12:48.475
What?

1316
01:13:01.823 --> 01:13:03.123
Swindell: No, no.

1317
01:13:03.125 --> 01:13:05.325
Man: Here we go, okay.
Cake coming through.


1318
01:13:05.327 --> 01:13:07.061
Oops.
Really?


1319
01:13:07.063 --> 01:13:08.929
Well, athletics
are not my strong suit.


1320
01:13:08.931 --> 01:13:10.731
Whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait, wait.


1321
01:13:10.733 --> 01:13:13.067
Is this not part
of the plan?


1322
01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:15.936
All: No!
Get out
of my way!


1323
01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:28.715
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.


1324
01:13:28.717 --> 01:13:30.517
Quick.

1325
01:13:51.573 --> 01:13:55.008
Swindell:
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hey!


1326
01:13:56.978 --> 01:13:58.445
Hey, hey, hey!

1327
01:13:58.447 --> 01:14:00.547
Hey, hey!

1328
01:14:08.356 --> 01:14:10.457
Swindell!

1329
01:14:11.526 --> 01:14:13.127
Sorry, coming through.

1330
01:14:13.129 --> 01:14:15.729
Here they come.

1331
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:17.131
Welcome to the <i>snake pit.</i>

1332
01:14:17.133 --> 01:14:19.133
Our next four inventors
are ready.


1333
01:14:19.135 --> 01:14:22.169
Inventors,
start your inventions!


1334
01:14:23.672 --> 01:14:25.706
This is the world's
strongest vacuum.


1335
01:14:25.708 --> 01:14:28.342
Okay, just imagine,
your soda's way over there.


1336
01:14:28.344 --> 01:14:32.412
Sorry, look,
we're shooting here.
You have to wait.


1337
01:14:33.648 --> 01:14:35.883
Safety goggles, please.

1338
01:14:38.487 --> 01:14:41.889
So you just
press this button.
(Beeping)


1339
01:14:44.059 --> 01:14:45.692
This is my laser
hedge trimmer.


1340
01:14:45.694 --> 01:14:48.495
Press here.
(Crowd gasps)


1341
01:14:48.897 --> 01:14:49.730
Do it again.

1342
01:14:49.732 --> 01:14:52.766
Just press
this button.
Out of my way.


1343
01:14:52.768 --> 01:14:54.735
Swindell!
Ben?


1344
01:15:03.344 --> 01:15:05.812
Sorry.
(Sizzling)


1345
01:15:05.814 --> 01:15:08.115
That's not good.

1346
01:15:11.753 --> 01:15:13.720
Stop that cake!
Oh!


1347
01:15:23.131 --> 01:15:26.567
Keep working out
those bugs, dad.


1348
01:15:26.569 --> 01:15:28.168
Oh, okay.

1349
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:32.639
Son?
What did you say
you called that again?


1350
01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:37.277
The igot it?
With a lowercase "I."


1351
01:15:37.478 --> 01:15:39.846
Trendy... ish.

1352
01:15:46.221 --> 01:15:48.422
Go, go!

1353
01:15:58.866 --> 01:16:01.034
Come on!

1354
01:16:03.938 --> 01:16:06.340
Griffin: Come on.

1355
01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.348
Stairs!
(Groans)


1356
01:16:15.016 --> 01:16:17.351
Go! Come on!
Go!


1357
01:16:17.418 --> 01:16:19.519
Griffin: Go!
Sorry!


1358
01:16:34.435 --> 01:16:37.170
Ben: Swindell,
he's getting away!


1359
01:16:38.907 --> 01:16:42.075
Griffin: What?
(Grunting)


1360
01:16:42.844 --> 01:16:44.211
It's locked.
What do we do?


1361
01:16:44.213 --> 01:16:47.180
There's got to be
another way in.


1362
01:16:47.649 --> 01:16:48.148
This way.

1363
01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:49.850
Coming through.
Savannah: Sorry.


1364
01:16:49.852 --> 01:16:51.718
Darren: Move.
Ben: Excuse me.


1365
01:16:56.024 --> 01:16:58.759
Man: <i>And now the father</i>
<i></i> <i>of the bride,</i>


1366
01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:00.894
<i>Mr. stroumboulopoulos.</i>

1367
01:17:03.866 --> 01:17:05.932
Whoa.

1368
01:17:11.572 --> 01:17:14.775
<i>For my daughter</i>
<i>and my new son...</i>


1369
01:17:14.777 --> 01:17:17.010
What do we do now?
Thinking.


1370
01:17:17.012 --> 01:17:19.413
<i>I wish them a lifetime</i>

01:18:22.077 --> 01:18:23.944
<i>He came all this way.</i>

1397
01:18:23.946 --> 01:18:25.212
Oh.

1398
01:18:25.214 --> 01:18:26.713
Is he one of yours?

1399
01:18:26.715 --> 01:18:28.648
Demetri, good to see you!

1400
01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:32.719
Oh!
Griffin: <i>Aw,</i>
<i></i> <i>what a beautiful moment.</i>


1401
01:18:32.721 --> 01:18:33.787
<i>Yes, that's great.</i>

1402
01:18:33.789 --> 01:18:36.923
<i>Well, look at the time.</i>
<i>I have rambled on long enough.</i>


1403
01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:39.126
<i>I think there's only</i>
<i></i> <i>one thing left to say</i>


1404
01:18:39.128 --> 01:18:41.495
<i>and that's...</i>

1405
01:18:41.996 --> 01:18:42.896
<i>Everybody dance!</i>

1406
01:18:42.898 --> 01:18:45.632
Savannah:
<i>Come alive! Whoo!</i>


1407
01:18:45.634 --> 01:18:47.634
<i>¶ Hey, I just met you</i>

1408

<i>¶ and this is crazy...</i>

1409
01:18:49.371 --> 01:18:51.571
I love this song!

01:18:51.573 --> 01:18:52.839
<i>¶ So call me maybe</i>

What is that doing
on my cake?


1435
01:19:52.166 --> 01:19:54.401
Daddy!

1436
01:19:54.403 --> 01:19:56.369
Griffin?

1437
01:19:56.371 --> 01:19:58.605
Yeah, this could
be a problem.


1438
01:19:58.607 --> 01:20:00.540
Uh...

1439
01:20:03.678 --> 01:20:05.645
It will be mine.

1440
01:20:07.816 --> 01:20:11.051
Go, guys, go!
Not a chance, baldy!


1441
01:20:11.053 --> 01:20:13.286
Oh!
(Grunts)


1442
01:20:13.288 --> 01:20:14.054
Go, go!

1443
01:20:14.056 --> 01:20:17.190
Oh, and it was
such a nice wedding.


1444
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:29.135
Woman: Oh!

1445
01:20:57.732 --> 01:21:00.166
Stop, stop!

1446
01:21:14.315 --> 01:21:16.383
(Gasping) Oh!

1447
01:21:38.105 --> 01:21:39.906
Mmm.

1448
01:21:56.891 --> 01:21:58.992
Oh, baby, I missed you.

1449
01:21:58.994 --> 01:22:00.160
Oh!

1450
01:22:00.162 --> 01:22:02.195
What is it?

1451
01:22:02.296 --> 01:22:03.663
You!

1452
01:22:03.665 --> 01:22:06.800
You ruined
my daughter's wedding!


1453
01:22:08.002 --> 01:22:11.638
Sir, from the bottom
of my heart...


1454
01:22:15.576 --> 01:22:17.010
I don't care.

1455
01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:23.083
Melissa:
He's getting away!
Ben: Griffin!


1456
01:22:36.697 --> 01:22:39.299
Someday you'll look back
and laugh.


1457
01:22:45.706 --> 01:22:46.506
Bye.

1458
01:22:46.508 --> 01:22:49.342
(Chuckling)
Griffin: Swindell!


1459
01:22:49.577 --> 01:22:52.012
(Chuckling)
Game over!


1460
01:22:52.014 --> 01:22:53.279
Late breaking score,

1461
01:22:53.281 --> 01:22:54.814
I win, you lose.

1462
01:22:54.816 --> 01:22:56.816
I got the red-head
captain cybertor.


1463
01:22:56.818 --> 01:22:59.653
I got the honus.
And you, bing,


1464
01:22:59.655 --> 01:23:02.222
Griffin bing, got...
Oh!


1465
01:23:04.026 --> 01:23:06.726
Where is swindell?

1466
01:23:08.696 --> 01:23:10.630
Oh...

1467
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.535
I pay for
red-haired captain cybertor.


1468
01:23:15.537 --> 01:23:19.973
So you give to me
red-haired captain cybertor


1469
01:23:19.975 --> 01:23:23.576
or I get angry.

1470
01:23:24.112 --> 01:23:27.447
I don't... I don't
have the red-headed
captain cybertor.


1471
01:23:27.449 --> 01:23:29.349
These kids.

1472
01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:31.785
No talk, swindell.

1473
01:23:31.787 --> 01:23:33.620
Cybertor. Now.

1474
01:23:33.622 --> 01:23:35.422
(Clears throat) Um...

1475
01:23:35.424 --> 01:23:36.322
We have one.

1476
01:23:36.324 --> 01:23:40.827
A red-haired
captain cybertor figure.


1477
01:23:40.829 --> 01:23:43.063
We could sell it to you,
Mr. swindell.


1478
01:23:43.065 --> 01:23:45.465
Original offer still stands.

1479
01:23:46.133 --> 01:23:47.000
No?

1480
01:23:47.002 --> 01:23:49.202
Okay, then.
He's all yours, Mr. volkov.


1481
01:23:49.204 --> 01:23:51.237
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.


1482
01:23:51.239 --> 01:23:53.807
Okay!
Okay, okay!


1483
01:23:53.974 --> 01:23:56.543
You win, bing.

1484
01:23:58.446 --> 01:24:02.582
Here, it's yours,
free and clear.


1485
01:24:06.721 --> 01:24:08.722
Fine.

1486
01:24:09.857 --> 01:24:11.825
Your card.
(Sighs)


1487
01:24:11.827 --> 01:24:14.728
I've never
doubted you.
You did.


1488
01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:16.663
Only a little.

1489
01:24:20.067 --> 01:24:22.602
What? Oh, yes.

1490
01:24:22.670 --> 01:24:24.504
There we go.

1491
01:24:24.506 --> 01:24:26.406
Here you go.

1492
01:24:27.608 --> 01:24:30.343
<i>Da.</i> Red hair.

1493
01:24:31.212 --> 01:24:33.046
(Chuckling) Good.

1494
01:24:33.048 --> 01:24:34.013
Good, good.
Good.


1495
01:24:34.015 --> 01:24:35.715
Good is good!
Yeah, yeah?


1496
01:24:35.717 --> 01:24:38.885
You got your red-haired
captain cybertor.
I got my money.


1497
01:24:38.887 --> 01:24:41.654
Everything's good, right?

1498
01:24:43.591 --> 01:24:45.992
No.
Oh.


1499
01:24:48.262 --> 01:24:50.830
You run now, swindell.

1500
01:24:51.031 --> 01:24:52.832
Run...

1501
01:24:52.834 --> 01:24:55.068
And never stop.

1502
01:25:04.079 --> 01:25:05.578
Swindell:
I wasn't looking!


1503
01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.646
I wasn't looking!

1504
01:25:06.648 --> 01:25:08.815
Your plan worked just like
you said it would, Griffin.


1505
01:25:08.817 --> 01:25:13.052
It did!
Feeling pretty egotastic
right now.


1506
01:25:14.121 --> 01:25:16.556
And you!
You were amazing.


1507
01:25:16.558 --> 01:25:20.260
Did you really think so,
Savannah?


1508
01:25:22.496 --> 01:25:25.498
(Chuckling)
I had a blast.


1509
01:25:25.699 --> 01:25:28.601
And, fellas,
the real kudos go to you.


1510
01:25:28.603 --> 01:25:31.371
You buoyed and grounded
my performance.


1511
01:25:31.373 --> 01:25:34.340
Our pleasure,
Mr. westcott.


1512
01:25:35.976 --> 01:25:38.611
Any chance to work
with the master.


1513
01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.013
You must be Darren.

1514
01:25:40.015 --> 01:25:42.816
My daughter, Savannah,
has told me all about you.


1515
01:25:42.818 --> 01:25:45.185
Says you have
some real talent.


1516
01:25:45.187 --> 01:25:46.820
(Laughs)
I was telling Darren


1517
01:25:46.822 --> 01:25:48.888
he should enroll
in your acting classes.


1518
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:51.524
Omg. Don't even think.

1519
01:25:51.526 --> 01:25:53.259
Just do it.

1520
01:25:53.261 --> 01:25:55.328
Uh, all right,
all right, I'm in.


1521
01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:56.963
(Cheering)
Yes, he's in!


1522
01:25:56.965 --> 01:25:58.965
You ready to make
a million dollars?


1523
01:25:58.967 --> 01:26:00.400
$1.2 million.

1524
01:26:00.402 --> 01:26:01.734
I like the sound of that.

1525
01:26:01.736 --> 01:26:03.169
Whoo!
Thank you.


1526
01:26:03.171 --> 01:26:06.105
Oh, man, thank you.
Thank you.


1527
01:26:06.107 --> 01:26:07.841
Whoo!

1528
01:26:10.744 --> 01:26:12.779
<i>Pardonnez-moi!</i>

1529
01:26:12.781 --> 01:26:14.480
Oh, hi.

1530
01:26:14.482 --> 01:26:15.982
I have one small question.

1531
01:26:15.984 --> 01:26:20.186
Who are you people
and why are you
disrupting my auction?


1532
01:26:20.188 --> 01:26:23.389
Um, actually,
that's two questions.


1533
01:26:24.226 --> 01:26:26.826
Who are we?
Yes, mmm-hmm?


1534
01:26:26.961 --> 01:26:31.164
We are the true owners
of an authentic
honus Wagner card.


1535
01:26:31.166 --> 01:26:32.699
(Gasping) Oh!

1536
01:26:32.701 --> 01:26:34.200
And good news.

1537
01:26:34.202 --> 01:26:35.501
We're selling.

1538
01:26:35.503 --> 01:26:37.904
<i>Bonjour.</i>
Please, right this way.
Thank you.


1539
01:26:37.906 --> 01:26:39.706
Right into
the biddings.
(Bidders gasp)


1540
01:26:39.708 --> 01:26:44.744
Let's start the bidding
at $500,000!


1541
01:26:47.815 --> 01:26:49.249
Oh!

1542
01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:03.630
This isn't $80,000.

1543
01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:07.133
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no!


1544
01:27:07.201 --> 01:27:08.401
Oh, no!

1545
01:27:08.403 --> 01:27:10.403
Oh, no, no.

1546
01:27:13.374 --> 01:27:17.143
What?
Woman:

1547
01:27:17.145 --> 01:27:18.978
Your bill.

Crown penthouse

1549

Eight hamburgers,

Thirty five thousand dollars?

1554
01:27:37.498 --> 01:27:40.400
Bing!

1555
01:27:41.368 --> 01:27:43.970
Bing!

1556
01:27:52.413 --> 01:27:54.714
Monies, ya.

1557
01:27:54.716 --> 01:27:56.783
I can't thank
you guys enough.


1558
01:27:56.785 --> 01:27:57.784
Dude, this goes
a long way.
Yeah,


1559
01:27:57.786 --> 01:28:00.219
what did your parents say
when you got home
with the money?


1560
01:28:00.221 --> 01:28:02.155
They were overjoyed,
no doubt.


1561
01:28:02.157 --> 01:28:03.122
Actually, no.

1562
01:28:03.124 --> 01:28:06.025
Turns out they didn't need
the money. Like, at all.


1563
01:28:06.027 --> 01:28:08.294
Well, I'm, I'm confused.
Explain, please.


1564
01:28:08.296 --> 01:28:09.929
The igot it was a big hit
at the <i>snake pit.</i>


1565
01:28:09.931 --> 01:28:14.233
Dad's got thousands of orders
from police stations
all across the country.


1566
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:17.337
I just bought stock
in the company.


1567
01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:18.071
Mmm, smart girl.

1568
01:28:18.073 --> 01:28:20.773
Nice, but what'd you do
with the rest of the money?


1569
01:28:20.775 --> 01:28:23.543
First, I sent
the stroumboulopouloses


1570
01:28:23.545 --> 01:28:27.080
<i>on a sweet honeymoon</i>
<i></i> <i>they'll never forget.</i>


1571
01:28:29.249 --> 01:28:31.684
The least
you could do.
Good idea.


1572
01:28:31.686 --> 01:28:33.720
And then I bought this.

1573
01:28:35.889 --> 01:28:36.856
Whew!

1574
01:28:36.858 --> 01:28:39.158
(Gasps)
The shield of barradon!


1575
01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.194
Do I look
like the poster?


1576
01:28:41.196 --> 01:28:44.030
You know what?
You kind of do.


1577
01:28:46.867 --> 01:28:49.168
(Whispering)
What's happening?


1578
01:28:51.171 --> 01:28:52.605
That's still a lot
of money left over.


1579
01:28:52.607 --> 01:28:56.242
Well, I was thinking
we had enough to pay
for everyone's college.


1580
01:28:56.244 --> 01:28:57.076
Nice.
Savannah: Sweet.


1581
01:28:57.078 --> 01:28:59.912
Dude, that's,
that's awesome.
Yeah!


1582
01:29:00.948 --> 01:29:02.181
Darren: Oh.
Yeah.


1583
01:29:02.183 --> 01:29:03.249
And as for the rest of it,

1584
01:29:03.251 --> 01:29:05.952
we earned it together,
we'll spend it together.


1585
01:29:05.954 --> 01:29:08.454
Now, that is a plan
I can embrace.


1586
01:29:08.456 --> 01:29:10.256
But on what?

1587
01:29:10.324 --> 01:29:11.858
Helping people.

1588
01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.760
Who?

1589
01:29:14.061 --> 01:29:17.363
Excuse me.
Are you Griffin bing?


1590
01:29:17.598 --> 01:29:19.298
Yeah.

1591
01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.033
Can you help me?

1592
01:29:20.035 --> 01:29:22.602
I had this blue parrot
named Berry...


1593
01:29:22.604 --> 01:29:23.269
Blue Berry, cute.

1594
01:29:23.271 --> 01:29:26.272
And I left him
to get groomed
at this pet shop.


1595
01:29:26.274 --> 01:29:31.210
But when I got back,
the shop owner
told me Berry had died.


1596
01:29:31.278 --> 01:29:32.478
Except he didn't.

1597
01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:35.782
He's selling him
to a man in Las Vegas.


1598
01:29:35.784 --> 01:29:36.349
Vegas?

1599
01:29:36.351 --> 01:29:39.085
Why would anybody
go through that much
trouble for a bird?


1600
01:29:39.087 --> 01:29:42.121
Berry is a rare
blue mutation Amazon


1601
01:29:42.123 --> 01:29:43.689
worth $20,000.

1602
01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:46.926
Ha! Well,
that's a good reason.


1603
01:29:47.161 --> 01:29:48.995
Can you help me?

1604
01:29:57.571 --> 01:29:59.739
Yes, I think we can.

1605
01:30:01.742 --> 01:30:03.976
<i>So, I'm Griffin bing.</i>

1606
01:30:03.978 --> 01:30:05.978
<i>And this is the team.</i>

1607
01:30:15.956 --> 01:30:19.559
<i>And we take down swindlers.</i>

1608
01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.744
