Guess you weren't expecting
to see me again, were ya?


312
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.110
Wild Bill? Is that you? 
You look like shit.

313
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.919
Ain't no Wild Bill.

314
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.915
They call me

315
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.560
- the Two Gun Kid.
- (GUN CLICKS)


316
00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.710
Keep your hands away
from your weapons, Faraday.


317
00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.396
- Hands up. Hands up.
- Hands away from the...


318
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.115
Get his guns, Dicky.

319
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.040
Don't try nothing.

320
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.592
Oh, a pretty one.

321
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.510
What's that, a Peacemaker?

322
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.160
EARL: Now turn around.

323
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.075
I'm not for sale.

324
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.318
Mister. Mister!

325
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.874
You intend to make me chase?

326
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.110
I have a proposition.

327
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.955
- And I'm wary of propositions, miss.
- Missus.


328
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.070
I'm not sure if my friend
filled you in on the details.


329
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.231
Enough of 'em.

330
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.672
Then why won't you at least listen?

331
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.750
(HORSE WHICKERS)

332
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.950
We're simple farmers.

333
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.470
Decent, hard-working people
being driven from our homes.


334
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.439
Men slaughtered in cold blood.

335
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.030
Women and children
without food or essentials.


336
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.956
All because some man named Bogue
wants to mine our valley and take it from us.


337
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.271
Bartholomew Bogue?

338
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.431
You know of him?

339
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.075
Heard the name.

340
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.799
What's this?

341
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.840
Everything we have.

342
00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.474
That's what it's worth to us.

343
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.357
Been offered a lot for my work
but never everything.


344
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.032
That man murdered my husband.

345
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.711
Killed him dead in
the middle of the street.

346
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.356
So you seek revenge.

347
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.197
I seek righteousness, as should we all.

348
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.553
But I'll take revenge.

349
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.150
FARADAY: The Two Gun Kid.

350
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.870
EARL: That's my name now.

351
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.190
'Cause you got two guns?

352
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.230
- Maybe not.
- Told you it was a stupid name.


353
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.110
Dicky, shut your goddamn mouth.

354
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.601
Faraday, walk!

355
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.037
Just mad 'cause Mama
gave him the name Earl.

356
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.670
What do you want to do with him?

357
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.196
How 'bout we take him over
into that mine there?


358
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.430
- Uh...
- Whoa.


359
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.430
This is as good a place as any.

360
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.591
Into the mine, Faraday.

361
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.030
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

362
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.600
If you're gonna rob me, rob me.

363
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.553
But I will not go in that mine.

364
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.715
There's rats in there.

365

Virginia City? 
Three days past?

366

Best you remember who'd you cheat
out of $50 in a card game!


367
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.950
I assure you I did not have to cheat
to beat the likes of you two.

(GUN CLICKS)

Easy.

370
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.561
Gentlemen, allow me a moment
to show you something quite miraculous.


371
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.150
You just show us our money, Faraday!

372
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.390
Fifty-two cards.

373
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.950
- Pick a card.
- We ain't playing no game.


374
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.630
You've got the drop on me.
You'll get a hoot outta this.


375
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.390
DICKY: Come on, Earl,
just pick one real quick.


376
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.359
You know how I like magic.

377
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.476
- All right, keep the gun on him.
- Got it trained right on him.


378
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.241
No tricks now.

379
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.790
Don't let me see it.

380
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.441
Show your associate.
Commit the card to memory.


381
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.951
When you're ready,
put the card back in the deck.


382
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.201
Don't try nothing.

383
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.470
Keep your gun on me. 
That's very good, Earl.

384
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.081
Now, there's no way I can know
what your card is because I didn't see it.


385
00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.872
- Yet...
- Come on. Let's go!


386
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.597
With a shuffle and a cut, miraculously,

387
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.710
your card.

388
00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.390
That ain't his card.
Man, you ain't no magic man.


389
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.510
That's not it? Hold on.

390
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.355
Quit playing around
before I blow your goddamn head off.


391
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.957
Oh, remember the plan, Earl.
I get to kill him.


392
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.080
You didn't let me finish.

393
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.515
Your card was the king of hearts, right?

394
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.190
- (LAUGHS)
- Is this your card?


395
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.030
Now, you see? That
was worth it, wasn't it?

396
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.470
- That was kind of good.
- Pretty good.


397
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.711
That was...

(GUN CLATTERS)

399
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.430
No, you just killed my brother. Huh?

- Should I kill you?
- No. Please.

Would you like to see another magic trick?

402

(WEAKLY) No.

Yeah. (GULPS)

No.

- (WHIMPERS)
- Disappearing...


407

(GROANS)

415
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.076
I didn't want to kill him.

416
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.759
He shouldn't have touched my guns.

417
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:53.270
The only way in is the valley floor,
and the main road in and out is to the west.

- And where's Bogue?
- Sacramento.


421
00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.553
Back in less than three weeks.

422
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.070
And how many men you say
you got left in town?


423
00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.311
Forty, maybe.

424

Farmers. Not fighters.

425
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.630
You understand what it means
when you start something like this?


426
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.077
We did not start this, Mr. Chisolm.

- (HORSE WHINNYING)
- WRANGLER: Whoa!


428
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.275
What are you waiting on?
Just get him under control.


429
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.350
Spend all night at the saloon, and then
you can't even control a silly horse.


430
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.270
Come on, lad, get in there!

431
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.150
Silly horse? That's a stallion.

432
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.150
His name's Jack, and he's killed men before,
so he oughta be careful.


433
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.471
- Easy, easy, easy!
- I require my horse back.


434
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.071
That horse.

435
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.390
Two days past.

436
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.830
Your horse against my Irish whiskey.

437
00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.990
Behind the saloon rolling dice.

438
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:51.200
That, sir, is a lie. 
A complete, absolute...

439
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.710
Good Lord.

440
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.190
- WRANGLER: Easy.
- I thought that was a dream.


441
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.550
I thought you were a leprechaun.
That was real?


442
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.270
Uh, I was mistaken.
I would like to buy my horse back.


443
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.115
Though I am light
of funds at the moment.

444
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.556
So...

445
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.350
Seems we have ourselves a Mexican standoff,

446
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.910
only between an Irishman and a Baptist,
and I'm not sure how that ends.


447
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:18.441
With you walking away without your horse.

448
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.030
Now, why'd you have to go
and touch your gun for?


449
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.510
We were in the middle
of a gentlemen's negotiation.

(HORSE WHICKERS)

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.230
To what do I owe the pleasure?

457
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.590
WRANGLER: Come on. (GROANS)

458
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.832
Took a job. Looking for
some men to join me.

459
00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.071
Is there money in it?

460
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.431
And who's she?

461
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.111
Joan of Arc.

462
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.435
My name's Emma Cullen.

463
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.230
And this is my associate, Teddy Q.

464
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.392
Well, I do have
an affinity for shiny things.

465

- Is it difficult?
- Impossible.

in the Indian Territories, Arkansas
and seven other states.


944
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:57.401
Now, what happened here was

945
01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:01.590
just an opening skirmish.

946
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:03.270
The real battle is yet to come.

947
01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:06.870
The idea is that when it comes,
it'll be on our terms.


948
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.790
- On our terms?
- Yeah, there's no way in hell.


949
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:12.550
Son of a bitch'll come back with 200 men
and slaughter us all.


950
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.634
If you want to leave, leave.

951
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:20.277
Just don't take anything
you didn't bring with you.


952
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:23.236
You want to keep your town,
you're gonna have to fight for it.


953
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:26.110
Now, we're here to help you,
but you got to help us.


954
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:29.070
We're gonna need every somebody out here
to help us fight.


955
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:32.590
Good Lord! Are you suggesting
we wait here to face retaliation?


956
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:33.790
- Hell, yeah, he is.
- What?


957
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:37.070
- Let 'em come. We'll be ready for 'em.
- PREACHER: I beg pardon, sir.


958
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.910
The spirit here is willing,

959
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:41.030
- but we are not killers.
- That's right.


960
01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:44.432
Most aren't, till they're looking
down the barrel of a gun.


961
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.993
Now, I never shot anything
that could shoot back at me.


962
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:49.716
But this is our home.

963
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:52.030
- Damned if I won't defend it.
- CHISOLM: That's right.


964
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:54.030
And now let me tell you,
these men that are coming here,


965
01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:55.470
they're gonna underestimate you.

966
01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:56.750
That'll be their first mistake.

967
01:04:56.830 --> 01:05:00.437
That's all well and good,
but we don't have enough time.


968
01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:03.590
Bogue said he'd be back in three weeks,
that was eight days ago.


969
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:06.030
- One week.
- That only leaves us... No, one week?


970
01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:07.794
- One week?
- CHISOLM: One week.

Three days' ride to Sacramento
with the bad news,


972
01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:12.310
one day for Bogue
to plan, three days back.

973
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:13.870

01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:37.399
He asked that you kindly stop
staring at his hairline.

- And if he just shoots you in the head?

Then just shoot him in the head.
Hell, I don't know, uh, avenge me.
