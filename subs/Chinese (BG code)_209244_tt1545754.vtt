00:15:00.737 --> 00:15:02.770
I NEED 3 1/2 POUNDS OF CRAYFISH.

310
00:15:02.772 --> 00:15:04.505
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

311
00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:06.807
- I WAS TELLING HIM
THEY'RE TOO LITTLE TO EAT,


312
00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:08.910
AND WE HAVE A STRICT
NO-RETURN POLICY.


313
00:15:08.912 --> 00:15:11.445
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
WHAT I WANT THEM FOR?


314
00:15:11.447 --> 00:15:13.281
THESE ARE THE BABIES
OF A SPECIES.


315
00:15:13.283 --> 00:15:15.249
YOU JUDGE A CULTURE ON HOW IT
TREATS ITS CHILDREN, RIGHT?


316
00:15:15.251 --> 00:15:16.450
THEY WERE HATCHED ONE DAY

317
00:15:16.452 --> 00:15:18.252
AND THEN RAISED
TO BE MURDERED THE NEXT,


318
00:15:18.254 --> 00:15:19.520
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT
ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED


319
00:15:19.522 --> 00:15:20.855
NERVOUS SYSTEMS
IN THE WORLD.


320
00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:25.426
IT'S LIKE US,
THE DOLPHINS, THEN THEM.


321
00:15:25.428 --> 00:15:26.627
- 100 BUCKS.

322
00:15:29.798 --> 00:15:31.766
- YOU KNOW, ANYONE
WHO'S GOING FISHING TODAY


323
00:15:31.768 --> 00:15:34.302
HAS PROBABLY COME AND GONE.

324
00:15:34.304 --> 00:15:35.903
HOW ABOUT A MARKDOWN?

325
00:15:35.905 --> 00:15:37.872
- I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

326
00:15:40.842 --> 00:15:44.278
- I'M NOT ARGUING WITH THE
SPIRIT OF OPERATION CRAYFISH,


327
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.714
I'M JUST SAYING
IT WAS OVERFUNDED.


328
00:15:50.953 --> 00:15:53.254
- IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

329
00:15:53.256 --> 00:15:55.723
I FORGOT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.


330
00:15:55.725 --> 00:15:58.559
- YEAH, I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK
SINCE MY PARENTS DIED.


331
00:15:58.561 --> 00:16:00.828
- YOUR PARENTS AREN'T DEAD.

332
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.564
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
SINCE THEY MOVED.


333
00:16:10.772 --> 00:16:12.907
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN CIRCLING
OUR DESTINATION


334
00:16:12.909 --> 00:16:14.942
FOR THREE HOURS NOW,

335
00:16:14.944 --> 00:16:16.744
AND MY FEELING
IS WE SHOULD GET DRESSED


336
00:16:16.746 --> 00:16:20.248
AND ROCK THIS FUNERAL.

337
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.751
- [sighs]
I THINK I'M READY.


338
00:16:32.261 --> 00:16:33.728
- OH!
- [coughing]


339
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.397
[coughing]
- UGH!


340
00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:39.000
GOD DAMN!
- UGH.


341
00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:53.581
[ignition turns over]

342
00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:55.816
[tires squeal]

343
00:16:55.818 --> 00:16:58.052
[tires screech]

344
00:17:03.692 --> 00:17:10.031
- [grunting]

345
00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:11.432
SHIT!

346
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:24.679
- I STILL SAY IT'S BETTER
THAN ENDING UP AS BAIT.


347
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:26.914
THEY MATE FOR LIFE,
YOU KNOW.


348
00:17:26.916 --> 00:17:29.417
- NOT THOSE.

349
00:17:34.623 --> 00:17:38.592
UH-OH, LOOK.
HE BLEW A FOOT.


350
00:17:38.594 --> 00:17:40.428
CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF YOU HAD TO SHOOT YOUR CAR


351
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.962
EVERY TIME YOU GOT A FLAT.

352
00:17:41.964 --> 00:17:43.898
- THOSE PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND THE LAND,


353
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.367
AND THEY LIVE BY IT.

354
00:18:05.654 --> 00:18:08.756
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

355
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:19.734
- ALTHOUGH SAM BAKER
WAS NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN,


356
00:18:19.736 --> 00:18:22.370
HE FOUND COMFORT AND JOY
IN HIS CHILDREN


357
00:18:22.372 --> 00:18:25.706
TERESA AND BENJAMIN,
AND HIS LOVELY WIFE ANGELA.


358
00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:28.042
NOW, A READING
FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT:


359
00:18:28.044 --> 00:18:30.077
SONG OF SOLOMON.

360
00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:32.113
"ARISE, MY LOVE,
MY FAIR ONE..."


361
00:18:32.115 --> 00:18:35.516
- LOOK AT HER.
THE SLUTTY WICKED STEPMOTHER.


362
00:18:35.518 --> 00:18:37.785
SHE WANTS IT ALL TO HERSELF.

363
00:18:37.787 --> 00:18:40.855
[minister continues
in background]


364
00:18:40.857 --> 00:18:44.825
YOU CAN PRACTICALLY
SEE THROUGH THAT DRESS.


365
00:18:44.827 --> 00:18:46.560
- "AND THE VOICE
OF THE TURTLEDOVE..."


366
00:18:46.562 --> 00:18:48.996
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- "IS HEARD IN OUR LAND."


367
00:18:48.998 --> 00:18:55.102
all: ¶ SHALL WE GATHER
AT THE RIVER ¶


368
00:18:55.104 --> 00:18:59.974
¶ WHERE BRIGHT ANGEL FEET
HAVE TROD ¶


369
00:18:59.976 --> 00:19:04.044
¶ WITH ITS CRYSTAL TIDE
FOREVER ¶


370
00:19:04.046 --> 00:19:08.716
¶ FLOWING BY THE THRONE
OF GOD ¶


371
00:19:08.718 --> 00:19:13.087
¶ YES, WE'LL GATHER
AT THE RIVER ¶


372
00:19:13.089 --> 00:19:17.992
¶ THE BEAUTIFUL,
THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER ¶


373
00:19:17.994 --> 00:19:22.463
¶ GATHER WITH THE SAINTS
AT THE RIVER ¶


374
00:19:22.465 --> 00:19:26.133
¶ THAT FLOWS
BY THE THRONE OF GOD ¶


375
00:19:26.135 --> 00:19:31.739
¶ ON THE MARGIN OF THE RIVER ¶

376
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:35.543
¶ WASHING UP ITS SILVER SPRAY ¶

377
00:19:35.545 --> 00:19:37.578
¶ WE WILL WALK... ¶

378
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.480
- I'M SORRY.

379
00:19:39.482 --> 00:19:41.782
WE GOT A LATE START.
- IT'S OKAY.


380
00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:45.152
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
YOU'RE HERE.


381
00:19:45.154 --> 00:19:49.723
- I JUST WISH I COULD SEE HIM.
[sobs]


382
00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:54.195
- I JUST WISH
HE COULD SEE THAT BEARD.


383
00:19:54.197 --> 00:19:58.799
all: ¶ GATHER WITH THE SAINTS
AT THE RIVER ¶


384
00:19:58.801 --> 00:20:01.502
¶ THAT FLOWS
BY THE THRONE OF GOD ¶


385
00:20:01.504 --> 00:20:05.039
- YOUR COAT SMELLS WEIRD.

386
00:20:06.908 --> 00:20:09.777
- [sobbing]

387
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:31.065
[loud engine starts]

388
00:20:41.776 --> 00:20:43.110
- I'M JUST SAYING,

389
00:20:43.112 --> 00:20:44.245
I THINK WE SORT OF
HAVE TO STEP UP


390
00:20:44.247 --> 00:20:45.946
INTO THE ROLE OF ADULTS NOW

391
00:20:45.948 --> 00:20:48.516
AND DECIDE WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE ESTATE.


392
00:20:49.718 --> 00:20:51.051
I HAD SOME IDEAS,

393
00:20:51.053 --> 00:20:53.254
SOME OF WHICH
I ACTUALLY RAN PAST DAD--


394
00:20:53.256 --> 00:20:55.689
SO I KNOW HE WASN'T OPPOSED--

395
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:57.825
ABOUT BASICALLY DEALING
WITH THE STORE.


396
00:20:57.827 --> 00:20:59.660
[clunking and clattering]

397
00:20:59.662 --> 00:21:02.930
HOW ARE THE RIBS?
- THEY'RE GOOD.


398
00:21:02.932 --> 00:21:05.232
THEY'RE SMALL,
SO THEY'RE EITHER REALLY CHEAP


399
00:21:05.234 --> 00:21:08.936
OR OFF A REALLY,
REALLY YOUNG PIG.


400
00:21:08.938 --> 00:21:10.704
- MY STEAK'S--
[clears throat]


401
00:21:10.706 --> 00:21:12.706
STEAK'S PRETTY GOOD.

402
00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:14.742
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT LOOKS GOOD IS--


403
00:21:14.744 --> 00:21:15.976
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE, BEN?

404
00:21:15.978 --> 00:21:18.913
SOME DEEP-FRIED ONIONS
DIPPED IN RANCH?


405
00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:21.181
I BET IT TASTES
LIKE SPRINGTIME.


406
00:21:21.183 --> 00:21:25.219
BOY, THAT VEGETARIAN LIFESTYLE
TAKES A LOT OF DISCIPLINE.


407
00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:28.222
- AND THE FARM.

408
00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:30.190
THERE'S JUST THAT CRUDDY HOUSE,

409
00:21:30.192 --> 00:21:33.160
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ALMOST 150 ACRES OF LAND.


410
00:21:33.162 --> 00:21:35.629
- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE
TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.


411
00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:38.198
- JESUS, STEVE,
EAT YOUR FUCKING RIBS.


412
00:21:40.902 --> 00:21:42.670
- ARE YOU SURE NOBODY WANTS
ANY WINE?


413
00:21:42.672 --> 00:21:44.071
I GOT THE BEST ONE
ON THE LAMINATE.


414
00:21:44.073 --> 00:21:47.274
- WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?
- I'M HIS RIDE.


415
00:21:47.276 --> 00:21:51.111
- LOOK, BEN, I WANTED
TO DISCUSS THIS JUST AS FAMILY,


416
00:21:51.113 --> 00:21:54.348
WITHOUT HER AND CERTAINLY
WITHOUT YOUR RIDE.


417
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.317
[clatter]

418
00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:58.986
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE SUITED
TO DEAL WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF.


419
00:21:58.988 --> 00:22:02.022
AND I DON'T MEAN THAT
AS AN INSULT.


420
00:22:02.024 --> 00:22:04.892
I JUST KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN
HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE AS IT IS.


421
00:22:04.894 --> 00:22:08.062
AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT
THE PROPERTY IS ACTUALLY WORTH--


422
00:22:08.064 --> 00:22:13.734
- JUST SO WEIRD TO BE HOME
AND TO THINK THAT HE'S NOT HERE.


423
00:22:13.736 --> 00:22:18.973
THAT WE JUST PUT HIM
IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND.


424
00:22:18.975 --> 00:22:20.808
- YOU KNOW, TERRY, MAYBE--

425
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.743
MAYBE NOW REALLY ISN'T
THE BEST TIME.


426
00:22:22.745 --> 00:22:25.312
- I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU CAN JUST SIT BACK,


427
00:22:25.314 --> 00:22:28.649
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

428
00:22:28.651 --> 00:22:30.784
- AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

429
00:22:30.786 --> 00:22:34.188
- TO TAKING CARE OF THINGS.

430
00:22:38.026 --> 00:22:40.995
[rooster crows]

431
00:22:40.997 --> 00:22:44.331
[goat bleats,
pig snorts]


432
00:22:44.333 --> 00:22:46.066
- YOU CAN STAY A NIGHT.

433
00:22:46.068 --> 00:22:47.968
YOU SAID THAT GUY WITH
THE MUSTACHE WILL COVER FOR YOU.


434
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.337
- DELIA? YEAH, SHE'LL DO.

435
00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:54.308
SHE'S A GOOD EMERGENCY MEASURE,
BUT WHAT AM I DOING HERE?


436
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.909
I MEAN, DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO GO HOME


437
00:22:55.911 --> 00:22:58.078
AND WATER THE PLANT AT LEAST?

438
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.748
- I JUST WANT
ALL THIS TO GO AWAY.


439
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.049
- LOOK, MAN, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FACE IT.


440
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:04.318
YOUR SISTER
IS STILL A TOTAL BUZZKILL.


441
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.186
- SO YOU'LL STAY?
I'VE GOT A SLEEPING BAG.


442
00:23:06.188 --> 00:23:08.355
- I COULD BE PERSUADED.

443
00:23:16.998 --> 00:23:19.733
- WHAT'S THAT, OBI-WAN?
YOU WANT ME TO STAY TOO?


444
00:23:21.336 --> 00:23:25.005
YOU GOT
MY FUCKING SKATES, BEN.


445
00:23:25.007 --> 00:23:32.112
- [snores]

446
00:23:32.114 --> 00:23:34.314
- [laughs]

447
00:23:34.316 --> 00:23:35.983
- [snores and laughs]

448
00:23:45.427 --> 00:23:46.960
- HEY.

449
00:23:46.962 --> 00:23:50.731
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.


450
00:23:50.733 --> 00:23:54.001
- WELL, THAT'S LIFE, ISN'T IT?

451
00:23:54.003 --> 00:23:57.971
WE'RE LIKE WAVES IN THE OCEAN.
WE ROLL IN,


452
00:23:57.973 --> 00:24:01.008
WE HAVE OUR EXISTENCE,
WE BREAK ON THE SHORE.


453
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.910
- HMM.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL


454
00:24:02.912 --> 00:24:05.713
AND NAUTICAL WAY
TO THINK OF THINGS.


455
00:24:09.884 --> 00:24:11.752
NOW, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SHUT THAT WINDOW.


456
00:24:11.754 --> 00:24:14.755
WE'RE EXPECTING SOME SHOWERS
COMING IN FROM THE COAST.


457
00:24:14.757 --> 00:24:17.291
- I DOUBT IT.
HASN'T RAINED HERE IN A WHILE.


458
00:24:17.293 --> 00:24:20.027
- WELL,
YOU'RE THE WEATHER MAN.


459
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:21.361
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GONNA BE STAYING

IN EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE
THAT WAS REAL:


615
00:31:32.728 --> 00:31:36.663
HIS FOOD, HIS FARM,
HIS BUSINESS,


616

AND, YES, HIS WIFE.

617
00:31:39.301 --> 00:31:41.168
- SO WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL
AND YOU IMAGINED


618
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.836
BEING WITH SOMEBODY,
THAT WAS IT?


619
00:31:42.838 --> 00:31:45.505
- [laughs]
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.


620
00:31:47.842 --> 00:31:50.243
SAM NEEDED ME,
AND HE DESERVED ME,


621
00:31:50.245 --> 00:31:51.912
BECAUSE HE WAS
WONDERFUL TO ME.


622
00:31:51.914 --> 00:31:54.181

ABOUT SOMEONE I KNEW.

LONGER THAN YOU,
ACTUALLY.


624
00:31:55.717 --> 00:31:57.450
HE STOPPED TALKING TO HIS SON.

625
00:31:57.452 --> 00:32:00.353
- BEN STOPPED TALKING TO HIM,
AND IT BROKE HIS HEART.


626
00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:05.926
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE YOU BETTER
RUN ALONG AND GET HIGH,

WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION.

BECAUSE I CAN'T DO IT ALL ALONE.

712

- STEVE, I WOULD PREFER
TO FOREGO YOUR INPUT,


716
00:36:19.714 --> 00:36:22.148
SINCE IT MOST RECENTLY RESULTED
IN MY BROTHER BECOMING FAT,


717
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.785
UNEMPLOYED, AND GROWING
THAT SUPERBLY ANTISOCIAL BEARD.

YOU KNOW WHAT, TERRY?
I AM GONNA GET OUT OF YOUR WAY.

723
00:36:43.171 --> 00:36:46.606
THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAKE NOW
COULD SECURE A REAL FUTURE.

- YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT?
- I'M SORRY!

00:36:48.143 --> 00:36:50.243
I GUESS I JUST
GOT BLINDSIDED YESTERDAY.

727
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.646
I DIDN'T WANT THE HEADACHE,
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,

"ALL OF THIS IS PART
OF SOMETHING AMAZING.

730
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.621
- YES, EXACTLY.

731
00:37:01.623 --> 00:37:02.956

HAS SERVED US

THIS CAPITAL


736
00:37:11.633 --> 00:37:13.099
TO RIGHT SOME MAJOR WRONGS,

737
00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:15.268
EDUCATE SOME MYSTERIES,
SET SOME IDEAS FREE.


738
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.972
- WELL, WHY DON'T I FIND A WAY
TO MANAGE MY FINANCES


739
00:37:18.974 --> 00:37:20.874
SO I CAN SUPPORT YOU
IN EIGHT MONTHS,


740
00:37:20.876 --> 00:37:23.543

IT TOOK DAD A LIFETIME TO MAKE.


741
00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:25.245

FROM, BUT IT'S JUST MONEY.


742
00:37:25.247 --> 00:37:27.814
IT DOESN'T MEAN DAD
LOVED ME MORE THAN YOU.


743
00:37:27.816 --> 00:37:29.516
- WHAT?

744
00:37:29.518 --> 00:37:31.251
- IT DOESN'T MEAN DAD LOVED ME
MORE THAN YOU.


745
00:37:31.253 --> 00:37:33.620
- HE DIDN'T...
LOVE YOU MORE.


746
00:37:33.622 --> 00:37:36.656
YOU WERE THE SQUEAKY WHEEL,
SO YOU GOT ALL THE OIL.


747
00:37:38.759 --> 00:37:40.727
AND IF I WERE YOU,

748
00:37:40.729 --> 00:37:44.764
I WOULDN'T RUSH OFF TO GO CHANGE
THE WORLD QUITE YET.


749
00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:53.206

00:37:53.208 --> 00:37:54.674
ANYBODY?

00:37:54.676 --> 00:37:57.143
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

752
00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:09.589
BEN! BEN!

753
00:38:09.591 --> 00:38:13.826
- YEAH, I'M UP HERE.

754
00:38:13.828 --> 00:38:15.862
- LOOK AT YOU.

755
00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:19.032
MASTER OF ALL YOU SURVEY.
- YEAH.


756
00:38:19.034 --> 00:38:21.968
- YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T GO IF
I DIDN'T HAVE THIS JOB THING.


757
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.037
I'LL BE OUT NEXT WEEKEND,
I PROMISE.


758
00:38:24.039 --> 00:38:27.106
PLUS, YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL.
- OH, I'LL CALL.


759
00:38:27.108 --> 00:38:30.577
I'LL CALL AS SOON AS I GET
THAT BIG FAT CHECK FOR YOU.


760
00:38:30.579 --> 00:38:34.314
- HEY, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE REALLY GONNA DO THAT.


761
00:38:34.316 --> 00:38:38.151
- HEY, BUDDY,
I LOVE YOU.


762
00:38:38.153 --> 00:38:41.120
- TAKE A SHOWER, OKAY?

763
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.891
[car alarm chirps]

764
00:38:48.662 --> 00:38:49.896
- WAIT, SO YOU'RE
JUST GONNA LEAVE?


765
00:38:49.898 --> 00:38:51.998
- YEAH, I GOTTA GET GOING.

766
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.634
IT WAS REALLY GREAT TO SEE YOU,
AND THANKS FOR THE PIE.


767
00:38:54.636 --> 00:38:57.203
- THAT WAS FOR DINNER.
- I'LL BE EATING DINNER.


768
00:38:57.205 --> 00:38:58.871
- NO, FOR EVERYONE.

769
00:38:58.873 --> 00:39:00.740
- YOU'RE NOT AS GIVING
AS I THOUGHT YOU WERE.


770
00:39:00.742 --> 00:39:02.275
- I DON'T WANT THE PIE BACK.
I JUST--


771
00:39:02.277 --> 00:39:04.844
WELL, I GUESS YOU KNOW BEN
BETTER THAN I DO.


772
00:39:04.846 --> 00:39:06.779
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY HERE
BY HIMSELF?


773
00:39:06.781 --> 00:39:09.248
- BY HIMSELF?
WHAT, NOW YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE?


774
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.984
I MEAN, WITH THAT POOR KID
UP THERE?


775
00:39:10.986 --> 00:39:13.186
- SO HE'S NOT OKAY?
- HE'S RIGHT AS RAIN.


776
00:39:13.188 --> 00:39:16.255
I MEAN, HIS FATHER JUST DIED,
HE'S GOT A DRUG PROBLEM,


777
00:39:16.257 --> 00:39:18.725
PROBABLY SOME KIND OF
MANIC-DEPRESSIVE DISORDER,


778
00:39:18.727 --> 00:39:21.794
AND, HONESTLY, HE WASN'T
THAT WELL SCREWED TOGETHER


779
00:39:21.796 --> 00:39:23.930
TO BEGIN WITH,
BUT HE'S AN ADULT,


780
00:39:23.932 --> 00:39:26.633
AND I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO DO THE 4:30 WEATHER.


781
00:39:26.635 --> 00:39:28.701
AND THOUGH YOU'RE UNDER
NO OBLIGATION,


782
00:39:28.703 --> 00:39:31.638
WOULD IT BE SO BAD TO TAKE
ANOTHER TWO OR THREE WEEKS


783
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.073
BEFORE YOU DO WHATEVER BULLSHIT
YOU HAVE TO DO?


784
00:39:34.075 --> 00:39:37.343
- YOU MEAN
TEACHING DISABLED KIDS?


785
00:39:37.345 --> 00:39:39.312
- OH, NOW THEY'RE DISABLED.

786
00:39:39.314 --> 00:39:41.714
DO YOU HAVE ANY ACTUAL PLANS?

787
00:39:45.152 --> 00:39:47.387
- I GUESS I COULD TAKE
MY TIME MOVING OUT.


788
00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:49.055
- GREAT.
- YOU GET A WEEK,


789
00:39:49.057 --> 00:39:50.657
AND I'M NOT ADOPTING HIM.

790
00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:53.793
- PERFECT.
I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU MY NUMBER,


791
00:39:53.795 --> 00:39:55.962
IN CASE
YOU HAVE TO GET IN TOUCH.


792
00:39:55.964 --> 00:39:59.432
DID YOU KNOW I'M ON TV?

793
00:39:59.434 --> 00:40:02.035
- [laughs]

794
00:40:02.037 --> 00:40:05.104
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
SAM BRAGGED ABOUT YOU ONCE.


795
00:40:05.106 --> 00:40:07.840
- I THINK HE LIKED YOU, BUT
HE COULDN'T REALLY EXPRESS IT.


796
00:40:07.842 --> 00:40:12.345
- YEAH, IT ALWAYS CAME OUT
AS "MORON TROUBLEMAKER."


797
00:40:12.347 --> 00:40:13.880
HE HATED THE IRISH TOO.

798
00:40:13.882 --> 00:40:15.715
PEOPLE FORGET THAT.

799
00:40:15.717 --> 00:40:17.984
[car door closes,
engine starts]


800
00:40:17.986 --> 00:40:20.119
OKAY, NOW, WILL YOU LET ME KNOW
IF I RUN OVER A CHICKEN?


801
00:40:20.121 --> 00:40:23.056
'CAUSE THE PIE'S
ALL I CAN EAT RIGHT NOW.


802
00:40:23.058 --> 00:40:24.457
- HOW LONG
DOES HE STAY UP THERE?


803
00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:26.025
- LET ME KNOW.

804
00:40:49.817 --> 00:40:51.918
- HEY.
- HEY.


805
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.486
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

806
00:40:53.488 --> 00:40:56.089
- [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW.


807
00:40:56.091 --> 00:40:57.757
IT'S ALL TEMPORARY, RIGHT?

808
00:40:57.759 --> 00:40:59.992
- ANGELA, YOU KNEW, WHEN YOU
DECIDED TO GET INVOLVED


809
00:40:59.994 --> 00:41:03.763
WITH A MAN SO MUCH OLDER,
IT WASN'T FOR LIFE.


810
00:41:03.765 --> 00:41:05.898
- YOU ARE SO SENTIMENTAL.

811
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.268
- OKAY, ALLS I'M SAYING
IS THAT YOU HAD THAT EXPERIENCE.


812
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.504
NOW, DON'T BE AFRAID
TO BE WITH A MAN YOUR AGE.


813
00:41:11.506 --> 00:41:13.106
YOU GOT A WHOLE TIME AHEAD.

814
00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:17.343
- BEN ASKED ME TO PUT THESE UP.

815
00:41:17.345 --> 00:41:19.779
- I HAVE SOME.
THEY UPSET PEOPLE.


816
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:22.415
- HEY, MA, SAMUEL STOLTZFOOS
IS OUTSIDE.


817
00:41:22.417 --> 00:41:24.083
YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE
THE LETTUCE WITH HIM.


818
00:41:24.085 --> 00:41:27.854
- NO, LISTEN, I GOTTA GO.
I MIGHT NEED MY HANDS.


819
00:41:27.856 --> 00:41:29.789
OKAY.

820
00:41:29.791 --> 00:41:31.491
- HELLO, TERRY.
- GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.


821
00:41:36.964 --> 00:41:40.099
- IT'S HARD, HUH,
WITHOUT HIM?


822
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:43.102
- YEAH, TRY TO KEEP BUSY.

823
00:41:44.438 --> 00:41:46.272
- UH, ABOUT BEN--

824
00:41:46.274 --> 00:41:48.875
- GOD, DON'T STICK YOUR NOSE
IN THAT TOO.


825
00:41:48.877 --> 00:41:50.476
- I'M LIVING WITH HIM, TERRY.

826
00:41:50.478 --> 00:41:52.845
- NOBODY ASKED YOU TO.
IN FACT, I'M SURPRISED


827
00:41:52.847 --> 00:41:54.046
THAT YOU DIDN'T
BLOW OUT OF TOWN


828
00:41:54.048 --> 00:41:55.248
ON THE NEXT GUY
WHO CAME THROUGH.


829
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.483
- [scoffs]
JESUS, THAT TONGUE!


830
00:41:57.485 --> 00:42:00.186
I THINK YOU JUST SPOILED
ALL THE VEGETABLES IN HERE.


831
00:42:00.188 --> 00:42:02.321
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAME
INTO MY FAMILY VERY RECENTLY


832
00:42:02.323 --> 00:42:04.524
AND YOU STARTED TELLING
EVERYBODY WHAT TO DO,


833
00:42:04.526 --> 00:42:07.059
WHICH WAS NOTHING--
DO NOTHING.


834
00:42:07.061 --> 00:42:09.228
- THAT IS NOT TRUE!
- YOU CONVINCED MY FATHER


835
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.164
TO LET A THRIVING BUSINESS
GO TO SEED.


836
00:42:11.166 --> 00:42:14.167
"THESE ARE THE GOOD YEARS!
LIFE IS FOR LIVING!"


837
00:42:14.169 --> 00:42:16.169
I MEAN, CHRIST!
A MAN HIS AGE


838
00:42:16.171 --> 00:42:18.905
THROWING HIMSELF INTO YOGA
AND GUITAR LESSONS--


839
00:42:18.907 --> 00:42:21.507
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GROWING!
- YOU DON'T GROW!


840
00:42:21.509 --> 00:42:23.376
YOU'RE A TUMBLEWEED

841
00:42:23.378 --> 00:42:25.478
WHO BLOWS AROUND WHENEVER
THE WIND CHANGES.


842
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.080
- SHIT, I SWORE
I WOULDN'T ENGAGE.


843
00:42:28.082 --> 00:42:29.315
I GOTTA GO.

844
00:42:29.317 --> 00:42:31.918
- YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE HIDE IN CHARITY.


845
00:42:33.921 --> 00:42:36.022
- ONCE IN A WHILE,
ASSUME OTHER PEOPLE


846
00:42:36.024 --> 00:42:38.124
ARE AS GOOD AS YOU,
NOT WORSE.


847
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.929
- THEY'RE NOT.

848
00:42:42.931 --> 00:42:46.098
- HOW WAS THE VACATION?

849
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.034
- IT WASN'T A VACATION.
- OH.


850
00:42:48.036 --> 00:42:49.502
DID YOU GET YOUR EYES DONE?

851
00:42:49.504 --> 00:42:51.137
- [over P.A.] DELIA
GOT SOME FAN MAIL, YOU KNOW.


852
00:42:51.139 --> 00:42:52.538
- IS THAT RIGHT?

853
00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.273
- 100 BUCKS SAYS
DELIA'S FAN MAIL


854
00:42:54.275 --> 00:42:56.475
CAME FROM A MEMBER
OF THE CAFETERIA STAFF!


855
00:42:56.477 --> 00:42:58.311
- [over P.A.] CORPORATE THINKS
EACH PIECE OF MAIL


856
00:42:58.313 --> 00:43:00.379
REPRESENTS 1,000 VIEWERS.

857
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:02.615
- WHAT, DID SHE DO
A REALLY GOOD JOB?


858
00:43:02.617 --> 00:43:04.083
- HEY, WHAT WAS WITH YOU

859
00:43:04.085 --> 00:43:05.318
WRESTLING THAT BUM
THE OTHER DAY?


860
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.619
NICELY DONE.

861
00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:09.155
- SO DID YOU KNOW HIM
OR SOMETHING?


862
00:43:09.157 --> 00:43:11.324
- YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
YOU BUY SOMEONE A CUP OF COFFEE


863
00:43:11.326 --> 00:43:13.993
AND SUDDENLY,
THEY'RE YOUR BEST FRIEND.


864
00:43:13.995 --> 00:43:15.361
DO I NEED MY EYES DONE?

865
00:43:15.363 --> 00:43:16.963
- 30 SECONDS.

866
00:43:16.965 --> 00:43:18.865
- IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL
TO MAKE THEM ANY BLUER.


867
00:43:18.867 --> 00:43:21.200
- SEE, THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

868
00:43:21.202 --> 00:43:23.202
- SPINACH CHECK.

869
00:43:23.204 --> 00:43:25.605
[door opens]
- YOU HAVE NO WHITENING TRAYS?


870
00:43:25.607 --> 00:43:29.041
NOW I REALLY CAN'T STAY.

871
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.082
- GOD, IT MUST BE TOUGH
HAVING TO WIN THE VIEWERS OVER


872
00:43:36.084 --> 00:43:37.950
ONE AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

873
00:43:37.952 --> 00:43:41.220
- YOU KNOW, WHILE YOU WERE OFF
GETTING YOUR EYES DONE


874
00:43:41.222 --> 00:43:44.223
OVER THE WEEKEND, PAUL FLEW ME
TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD


875
00:43:44.225 --> 00:43:45.958
TO SHOW ME THIS HOUSE,

876
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.895
AND IT WASN'T ONE OF THOSE
STUPID CAPE COD HOUSES


877
00:43:48.897 --> 00:43:52.198
THE TOURISTS LOVE.
THIS WAS A YEAR-ROUND HOME


878
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.034
WHERE YOU COULD REALLY BE
A PART OF THE ISLAND.


879
00:43:55.036 --> 00:43:57.203
PAUL UNDERSTANDS
THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR JOB,


880
00:43:57.205 --> 00:44:00.106
AND, LET'S FACE IT,
IT'S A SHORT WINDOW


881
00:44:00.108 --> 00:44:02.174
AND IT'S NOT REALLY BASED
ON SKILL.


882
00:44:02.176 --> 00:44:04.510
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.
LUCKY FOR ME,


883
00:44:04.512 --> 00:44:07.580
MY FINANCES HAVE KIND OF BEEN
TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES.


884
00:44:07.582 --> 00:44:10.283
- SANDWICH GUY TOLD ME
YOU NAILED THE BASEBALL POOL.


885
00:44:10.285 --> 00:44:13.619
- NO, REALLY. I'M COMING
INTO A LITTLE PIECE OF PROPERTY


886
00:44:13.621 --> 00:44:16.522
UP IN LANCASTER MYSELF.
I'LL PROBABLY UNLOAD IT.


887
00:44:16.524 --> 00:44:18.324
BRIAN WILLIAMS
HAS A PLACE UP THERE.


888
00:44:18.326 --> 00:44:20.259
- I DON'T THINK SO.

889
00:44:22.663 --> 00:44:25.364
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

890
00:44:25.366 --> 00:44:29.602
- WHICH IS WHY I'M SICK
AND TIRED OF THE BULLSHIT.


891
00:44:29.604 --> 00:44:31.370
- EXCUSE ME, SORRY.

892
00:44:31.372 --> 00:44:32.605
I WAS JUST PASSING THROUGH.

893
00:44:32.607 --> 00:44:34.607
- SIT, PLEASE.
JOIN US.


894
00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:41.414
EVERYBODY, THIS IS ANGELA,
MY STEPMOTHER.


895
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:48.387
- DIDN'T WE MEET
AT THE PLASTIC BAG RALLY?


896
00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:50.623
OH, YOUR SKIN IS SO WHITE.

897
00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:53.025
- I THINK WE SHOULD LISTEN NOW.

898
00:44:54.428 --> 00:44:57.964
- IF WE CREATE
A NON-PROFIT SOCIETY,


899
00:44:57.966 --> 00:45:01.133
WE CAN REAP THE TAX BENEFITS
OF SAID SOCIETY.


900
00:45:01.135 --> 00:45:04.203
IT IS GONNA BE
A BEGINNING AND AN ENDING


901
00:45:04.205 --> 00:45:05.972
OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT,

902
00:45:05.974 --> 00:45:11.544
AND THAT IS WHY I'M CALLING IT
"THE OMEGA SOCIETY."


903
00:45:11.546 --> 00:45:13.646
- I HATE TO STICK
MY NOSE INTO THIS, BUT--


904
00:45:13.648 --> 00:45:16.515
- EVERYONE'S VOICE
HAS EQUAL MERIT.


905
00:45:16.517 --> 00:45:19.652
- "THE OMEGA SOCIETY" SOUNDS
LIKE "THE OMEGA INSTITUTE."


906
00:45:19.654 --> 00:45:22.421
IT'S A HOLISTIC
ORGANIZATION.


907
00:45:22.423 --> 00:45:26.058
ENVIRONMENTALISM,
SPIRITUAL REBIRTH.


908
00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.995
- IT'S TOTAL SYNCHRONICITY
IS WHAT IT IS.


909
00:45:28.997 --> 00:45:31.564
NOT ONLY IS IT THE PERFECT NAME
FOR OUR SOCIETY,


910
00:45:31.566 --> 00:45:34.333
BUT IT ALREADY EXISTS.

911
00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:36.469
- I THINK THERE'S
AN OMEGA SOCIETY TOO,


912
00:45:36.471 --> 00:45:38.270
SO I DON'T THINK
LEGALLY WE--


913
00:45:38.272 --> 00:45:40.740
- JUSTIN, IT'S NOT
ABOUT WHAT IS LEGAL!


914
00:45:40.742 --> 00:45:42.441
I GREW UP OUT HERE.

915
00:45:42.443 --> 00:45:44.477
THERE ARE AMISH PEOPLE
ON THREE SIDES OF THIS FARM.


916
00:45:44.479 --> 00:45:46.345
THEY DON'T VOTE.

917
00:45:46.347 --> 00:45:48.047
THEY DON'T JOIN THE ARMY.

918
00:45:48.049 --> 00:45:51.384
THEY DON'T SEND THEIR CHILDREN
TO OUR SCHOOLS.


919
00:45:51.386 --> 00:45:56.355
WHEN YOU LIVE OFF THE LAND
AND YOU'RE HONEST,


920
00:45:56.357 --> 00:45:59.458
THINGS FALL INTO PLACE!

921
00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:06.165
YOU ARE A BEACON
TO THAT BABYLON OUT THERE.


922
00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:08.367
- MY COUSIN LIVES IN OREGON.

923
00:46:08.369 --> 00:46:11.070
BEN'S RIGHT.

924
00:46:16.543 --> 00:46:19.478
- SO I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
AT THE MARRIOTT BEFORE.


925
00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.414
- OH, I REALLY SHOULDN'T.

926
00:46:21.416 --> 00:46:24.316
- YOU JUST GONNA GO HOME
AND STARE AT AN EMPTY DOG BED?


927
00:46:24.318 --> 00:46:26.218
CHESTER DOESN'T GET HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL


928
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.687
TILL TOMORROW, RIGHT?

929
00:46:28.689 --> 00:46:30.790
- HIS NAME IS "CLARENCE,"

930
00:46:30.792 --> 00:46:32.792
HE GOT OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL TODAY,


931
00:46:32.794 --> 00:46:35.394
AND MY MOM IS WATCHING HIM.

932
00:46:35.396 --> 00:46:37.263
BUT YOU SURE ARE
A GOOD LISTENER.


933
00:46:37.265 --> 00:46:40.766
- SO ARE YOU, AND A VERY
BEAUTIFUL ONE, ACTUALLY.


934
00:46:42.669 --> 00:46:48.274
- [chuckles]
- [moans]


935
00:46:48.276 --> 00:46:49.842
- I THINK CLARENCE NEEDS ME.

936
00:46:49.844 --> 00:46:51.777
- SERIOUSLY,
I'M REALLY FAST.


937

[phone buzzes]

938
00:46:53.414 --> 00:46:55.214
DID YOU GIVE MY NUMBER
TO SOMEONE?


939
00:46:55.216 --> 00:46:56.849
- I DON'T EVEN HAVE YOUR--
- SHH, ONE SECOND.


940
00:46:56.851 --> 00:46:58.250
HELLO.

941
00:46:58.252 --> 00:46:59.652
- UGH.

942
00:46:59.654 --> 00:47:01.420
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN
TO BOTHER YOU.


943
00:47:01.422 --> 00:47:04.457
BEN'S FINE, BUT WE JUST GOT
THIS REGISTERED LETTER.


944
00:47:04.459 --> 00:47:05.858
TERRY'S CHALLENGING
THE WILL.


945
00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.393
- WHY?

946
00:47:07.395 --> 00:47:09.261
I MEAN, I KNOW WHY.
BUT UNDER WHAT GROUNDS?


947
00:47:09.263 --> 00:47:11.263
- WELL,
IT'S BEN'S COMPETENCY.


948
00:47:11.265 --> 00:47:12.598
THERE'S GONNA BE A HEARING,

949
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.633
AND HE HAS TO SEE
A PSYCHIATRIST.


950
00:47:14.635 --> 00:47:16.235
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

951
00:47:16.237 --> 00:47:18.871
THIS MORNING
THE BANK ACCOUNT WAS SHUT DOWN.


952
00:47:18.873 --> 00:47:21.440
IT'S A CLASSIC OBSTACLE
TO A PIONEER.


953
00:47:21.442 --> 00:47:24.777
IT'S LIKE GALILEO
OR CHE OR JESUS.


954
00:47:24.779 --> 00:47:26.612
EVERY GREAT MOVE
HAS A COUNTERMOVE.


955
00:47:26.614 --> 00:47:28.214
BUT LET ME TELL YOU,

956
00:47:28.216 --> 00:47:30.583
MY SISTER'S GREED IS NOT
GONNA STOP THE EVOLUTION


957
00:47:30.585 --> 00:47:33.119
OF MIND AND BODY
THAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE!


958
00:47:33.121 --> 00:47:35.121
- NO, NO, NO, LOOK,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.


959
00:47:35.123 --> 00:47:36.388
JUST GET A LAWYER.

960
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:39.191
- A LAW--
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY NOW?


961
00:47:39.193 --> 00:47:40.726
- GO SEE THE SHRINK.

962
00:47:40.728 --> 00:47:43.896
IT'S LIKE GIVING THEM THE MONEY
IF YOU DON'T GO.


963
00:47:43.898 --> 00:47:46.265
- I COULD BE MY OWN LAWYER,
YOU KNOW?


964
00:47:46.267 --> 00:47:47.533
- THERE YOU GO.

965
00:47:47.535 --> 00:47:49.135
- I COULD PREPARE A BRIEF,

966
00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:50.836
ONE OF THOSE 600-PAGE
OBSTRUCTIONIST BABIES.

WHO THEY'RE FUCKING WITH.

[phone thuds]

00:47:59.613 --> 00:48:01.180
- HEY, YOU STILL THERE?

970
00:48:01.182 --> 00:48:02.381
- YES.

971
00:48:02.383 --> 00:48:03.849
ANY OTHER FIRES TO PUT OUT?

972
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:06.185
- IT IS JUST GETTING
MORE AND MORE INTENSE,


973
00:48:06.187 --> 00:48:09.889
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER
PEOPLE INVOLVED NOW.


974
00:48:09.891 --> 00:48:13.292
- LIKE YOU AND ME?

975
00:48:13.294 --> 00:48:15.528
- NO, I MEAN THERE ARE
THESE HIPPIE KIDS NOW


976
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:18.664

AND NOW THIS COURT THING.


977

HE JUST SEEMS
VERY AGITATED.


978
00:48:20.601 --> 00:48:22.334
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO DEAL WITH IT,


979
00:48:22.336 --> 00:48:25.938
BUT...[sighs]
I'M JUST GLAD I COULD CALL YOU.


980
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.806
- YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL ME.

981
00:48:29.509 --> 00:48:31.710
- I'M LEAVING.
- [whispering] MAYBE YOU SHOULD.


982
00:48:31.712 --> 00:48:34.180
- OH, MY GOD,
IS THERE SOMEONE THERE?


983
00:48:34.182 --> 00:48:37.283
- NO, I'M ALONE.

984
00:48:37.285 --> 00:48:38.517
NOW.

985
00:48:38.519 --> 00:48:40.219
- I'M SORRY.

986
00:48:40.221 --> 00:48:43.889
- IT'S FINE.
YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR JOB.


987
00:48:43.891 --> 00:48:47.593
MY JOB ACTUALLY.

988
00:48:49.563 --> 00:48:50.930
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW HIM.

989
00:48:50.932 --> 00:48:52.631
- HE'S BEN.

990
00:48:52.633 --> 00:48:54.800
HE'S A BLAST
MOST OF THE TIME.


991
00:48:54.802 --> 00:48:56.969
BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
HIS MOTHER.


992
00:48:56.971 --> 00:49:00.873
HE INHERITED SOME THINGS
THAT WEREN'T IN THE WILL.


993
00:49:00.875 --> 00:49:02.575
- YEAH, SAM MENTIONED THAT.

994
00:49:02.577 --> 00:49:05.411

WHOLE FOODS THING
YOU GREW UP IN.


996
00:49:07.348 --> 00:49:08.781

997
00:49:08.783 --> 00:49:11.317
FOR THE HARTFORD
INSURANCE COMPANY.


998
00:49:11.319 --> 00:49:14.520
HE DIED AT HIS DESK.
I WAS STILL AT ANDOVER.


999
00:49:14.522 --> 00:49:18.490
- HUH.
LIKE, SAY, ABOUT SAM'S AGE?


1000
00:49:18.492 --> 00:49:20.626
- WHAT?
- SO YOU MUST BE LOADED.


1001
00:49:20.628 --> 00:49:23.529
- [laughs]

00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:25.531
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY OR NOT?

1003
00:49:25.533 --> 00:49:27.333
- THIS IS THE WAY
IT USUALLY GOES.


1004
00:49:27.335 --> 00:49:30.269
THE BEST THING TO DO
IS KEEP FEEDING HIM.


1005

FOOD IS NATURE'S VICODIN.

1006

THAT'S GOOD TOO, BY THE WAY,
IF YOU HAVE IT.


1007
00:49:37.877 --> 00:49:41.247
YOU SHOULD FINALLY BE GETTING
SOME RAIN UP THAT WAY, YOU KNOW?

FOR THESE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.

00:53:11.892 --> 00:53:14.059
YES, THE BEST WAY TO GET
THE SODA OUT OF THE BOTTLE


1062
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:17.162
IS TO SHAKE IT
AND SHAKE IT AND SHAKE IT.


1063
00:53:17.164 --> 00:53:19.097
NEED A RIDE?

1064
00:53:19.099 --> 00:53:20.499
- YES.

1065
00:53:25.939 --> 00:53:27.573
- NEXT TIME,
GO OVER TO THE HIGHWAY


1066
00:53:27.575 --> 00:53:30.008
AND GET ANDERSON TO RING
THE FIRE BELL FOR YOU.


1067
00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:31.510
- I WILL.
I APOLOGIZE.


1068
00:53:31.512 --> 00:53:32.945
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IN A BIT OF A PANIC.


1069
00:53:32.947 --> 00:53:35.247
- I AM TERRIBLY SORRY,
MR. YODER.


1070
00:53:35.249 --> 00:53:38.517
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.


1071
00:53:38.519 --> 00:53:41.753
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE ALL MISS HIM, OBVIOUSLY.


1072
00:53:41.755 --> 00:53:44.256
- HE WAS LUCKY TO HAVE
A LONG LIFE.


1073
00:53:44.258 --> 00:53:45.924
SUCH A CARING DAUGHTER.

1074
00:53:45.926 --> 00:53:49.495
ALL HE CARED ABOUT
WAS HIS FAMILY.


1075
00:53:49.497 --> 00:53:53.966
SURELY, THERE'S NO OTHER REASON
FOR BEING ON THIS EARTH.


1076
00:53:53.968 --> 00:53:56.802
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU COULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN?


1077
00:53:56.804 --> 00:54:00.706
- I WOULD PRAY TO GOD
TO SEND THEM TO ME.


1078
00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:03.542
- WHAT IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN GOD?


1079
00:54:05.879 --> 00:54:08.280
- MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN.


1080
00:54:12.085 --> 00:54:15.721
- [inhales]
[water gurgles]


1081
00:54:15.723 --> 00:54:18.056
HONESTLY, BEN,
YOU REALLY FUCKED ME HERE.


1082
00:54:18.058 --> 00:54:20.659
- MY INDEPENDENCE OF MIND
IS OBVIOUSLY A THREAT TO THEM.


1083
00:54:20.661 --> 00:54:22.928
- THEM?
- SOCIETY.


1084
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:24.763
WITH ALL THEIR POISON.

1085
00:54:24.765 --> 00:54:26.131
I'M NOT PUTTING IT
IN MY BODY.


1086
00:54:26.133 --> 00:54:27.933
- AND I RESPECT
THAT DEEP-FRIED TEMPLE


1087
00:54:27.935 --> 00:54:29.167
THAT YOU'VE BUILT,

1088
00:54:29.169 --> 00:54:32.004
BUT YOU HAVE
TO STOP RUNNING NAKED.


1089
00:54:32.006 --> 00:54:33.705
- I KNOW. I PANICKED.

1090
00:54:33.707 --> 00:54:36.542
EVEN THE MOST COMMITTED
MESSENGER HAS A MOMENT OF DOUBT.


1091
00:54:36.544 --> 00:54:38.043
- KEEP THAT WORD "COMMITTED"
IN MIND.


1092
00:54:38.045 --> 00:54:39.278
- NEXT TIME.

1093
00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.913
- OH, YOU MEAN
IN THE COURTROOM?


1094
00:54:40.915 --> 00:54:42.180
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE HEADING,


1095
00:54:42.182 --> 00:54:43.715
AND THEY MIGHT NOT STOP
WITH THE MONEY.


1096
00:54:43.717 --> 00:54:45.083
THEY CAN FORCE YOU
TO TAKE THE MEDICINE,


1097
00:54:45.085 --> 00:54:46.318
AND THEY CAN LOCK YOU UP.

1098
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.719
[knock at door]

1099
00:54:47.721 --> 00:54:49.655
WE'RE STUDYING IN HERE.

1100
00:54:49.657 --> 00:54:51.757
- ANYONE HUNGRY?
- NOT REALLY.


1101
00:54:51.759 --> 00:54:53.759
- I GOTTA GO.

1102
00:54:53.761 --> 00:54:55.327
- BEN, YOU OKAY?

1103
00:54:55.329 --> 00:54:56.828
- I DON'T KNOW.

1104
00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:58.697
I'M FEELING
A LITTLE STRESSED OUT.


1105
00:54:58.699 --> 00:55:00.332
- I'M STRESSED OUT.
YOU'RE CRAZY.


1106
00:55:00.334 --> 00:55:03.569
LET'S USE THE WORD FREELY
AS IF IT GIVES US POWER.


1107
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:06.004
GOOD NIGHT.

1108
00:55:11.678 --> 00:55:14.046
[dog barking]

1109
00:55:14.048 --> 00:55:16.114
- I SEE YOU'VE BEEN
ARRESTED A FEW TIMES.


1110
00:55:16.116 --> 00:55:18.083
PUBLIC OUTBURSTS,
INDECENCY,


1111
00:55:18.085 --> 00:55:20.218
A MISDEMEANOR
RELATED TO YOUR PROFESSION,


1112
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.722
WHICH YOU LISTED HERE
AS "SMALL FARMER."


1113
00:55:23.724 --> 00:55:26.758
I ALSO SEE THAT YOU'VE
NEVER CONSIDERED MEDICATION.


1114
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:31.129
- ANTIDEPRESSANTS?
THEY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED,


1115
00:55:31.131 --> 00:55:34.132
AS THEY HAVE BEEN
TO MOST OF AMERICA.


1116
00:55:34.134 --> 00:55:36.768
- WELL, I WAS THINKING
MORE LIKE A MOOD STABILIZER,


1117
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:38.136
WHICH FOR MOST
IS A VERY EFFECTIVE


1118
00:55:38.138 --> 00:55:40.105
THERAPEUTIC SOLUTION.

1119
00:55:40.107 --> 00:55:43.175
- NO NEED TO RESIST
THE MAGIC OF LITHIUM, I KNOW.


1120
00:55:43.177 --> 00:55:45.210
WE SHOULD SPRINKLE
ITS SALTY GOODNESS


1121
00:55:45.212 --> 00:55:46.945
OVER THE FRIES AT MCDONALD'S

1122
00:55:46.947 --> 00:55:48.880
UNTIL WE'RE
<i>DAWN OF THE DEAD</i> DROOLING


1123
00:55:48.882 --> 00:55:50.315
TOWARDS BANANA REPUBLIC,

1124
00:55:50.317 --> 00:55:52.618
PUSHING OUR CARTS, DAZED,
THROUGH THE MARKET,


1125
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.152
THROWING THE MEAT IN,

1126
00:55:54.154 --> 00:55:58.223
BLACK BLOOD POOLING
UNDER SO MUCH PLASTIC.


1127
00:55:58.225 --> 00:56:00.125
- THAT'S AN INTERESTING IMAGE.

1128
00:56:00.127 --> 00:56:02.761
- WHICH I WOULDN'T HAVE
IF I WAS ZONKED ON THAT SHIT.


1129
00:56:02.763 --> 00:56:04.796
I WOULDN'T FEEL THIS HUM
I'VE GOT GOING,


1130
00:56:04.798 --> 00:56:07.332
CLEAR, SHARP,
AND PURPOSEFUL,


1131
00:56:07.334 --> 00:56:10.235
LIKE EVERY ION IN MY BODY
IS VIBRATING WITH GENIUS.


1132
00:56:10.237 --> 00:56:11.737
- MARIJUANA IS A CHEMICAL.

1133
00:56:11.739 --> 00:56:13.772
- IT'S GREEN
AND FROM THE EARTH.


1134
00:56:13.774 --> 00:56:14.973
- BUT IT'S A DRUG,

1135
00:56:14.975 --> 00:56:16.742
A WAY OF DEALING
WITH YOUR SYMPTOMS.


1136
00:56:16.744 --> 00:56:18.910
- LIKE THE DRUG YOU GET
WHEN YOU GO INTO A RESTAURANT


1137
00:56:18.912 --> 00:56:20.412
OR COME HOME AFTER WORK

1138
00:56:20.414 --> 00:56:22.714
OR OFFER A STRANGER THE MOMENT
THEY COME IN YOUR HOUSE.


1139
00:56:22.716 --> 00:56:27.319
OUR WHOLE SOCIAL SYSTEM
IS BUILT AROUND SOME DRUG.


1140
00:56:27.321 --> 00:56:31.223
MOST CULTURES MADE BEER
BEFORE THEY HAD AN ALPHABET.


1141
00:56:31.225 --> 00:56:33.358
- I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS,


1142
00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.428
AND YOU CAN JUST TELL ME
YES OR NO, OKAY?


1143
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.930
DO YOU EXPERIENCE
SENSATIONS OF THINGS


1144
00:56:38.932 --> 00:56:42.267
THAT ARE NOT THERE?

1145
00:56:42.269 --> 00:56:46.805
DO YOU HEAR VOICES?

1146
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:50.942
ARE YOU AFRAID RIGHT NOW?

1147
00:56:54.981 --> 00:56:59.017
- THERE ARE TIMES
THAT ARE WONDERFUL,


1148
00:56:59.019 --> 00:57:01.853
AND THERE ARE TIMES
THAT ARE HORRIBLE,


1149
00:57:01.855 --> 00:57:05.323
AND THE WONDERFUL THING IS,
RIGHT NOW, I FEEL ALIVE.


1150
00:57:05.325 --> 00:57:08.360
BUT THE TERRIBLE THING IS THAT
YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME HOW I FEEL


1151
00:57:08.362 --> 00:57:09.961
ABOUT MY FATHER DYING.

1152
00:57:09.963 --> 00:57:11.396
- OH, WELL, I WAS GOING--

1153
00:57:11.398 --> 00:57:13.899
- I FEEL ALONE
IN THE UNIVERSE,


1154
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:16.134
EXCEPT FOR STEVE.

1155
00:57:19.872 --> 00:57:22.174
- SO WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE HERE?


1156
00:57:25.278 --> 00:57:27.479
- BECAUSE I WON THE LOTTERY.

1157
00:57:27.481 --> 00:57:32.317
EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR HAND OUT.

1158
00:57:32.319 --> 00:57:33.919
- NOW ACTION BACK TO BARRY
WITH HIS SUITED ACE.


1159
00:57:33.921 --> 00:57:36.955
80,000 TO CALL
TO SEE A FLOP HERE.


1160
00:57:36.957 --> 00:57:38.256
AND HE WILL HAVE TO--

1161
00:57:38.258 --> 00:57:39.357
[click]

1162
00:57:49.936 --> 00:57:52.471
- YES, YES,
YOU'LL CLEAN UP LATER.


1163
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.180
NO.

1164
00:58:02.182 --> 00:58:06.318
MOTHERFUCKING GOD DAMN
DAMN IT!


1165
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.253
[sighs]

1166
00:58:09.756 --> 00:58:11.757
LOOK AT IT, IT'S HUGE.

1167
00:58:11.759 --> 00:58:13.492
LEAVES AND ACORNS
EVERYWHERE.


1168
00:58:13.494 --> 00:58:15.227
YOU GOTTA GET RID OF IT.

1169
00:58:15.229 --> 00:58:17.262
- THE BUILDING IS CALLED
"THE OAKS."


1170
00:58:17.264 --> 00:58:18.897
IT'S THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

1171
00:58:18.899 --> 00:58:20.532
- IT'S JUST A TREE.

1172
00:58:20.534 --> 00:58:22.467
IT BLOCKS
ALL THE NATURAL LIGHT.


1173
00:58:22.469 --> 00:58:25.203
PLUS, IT DECREASES
THE VALUE OF MY UNIT.


1174
00:58:25.205 --> 00:58:27.506
I CAN CIRCULATE A PETITION
IF YOU WANT,


1175
00:58:27.508 --> 00:58:29.541
BUT YOU KNOW
EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME,


1176
00:58:29.543 --> 00:58:33.445
AND YOU GOTTA BE SICK
OF CLEANING UP ALL THIS CRAP.


1177
00:58:33.447 --> 00:58:35.046
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

1178
00:58:35.048 --> 00:58:37.215
- GREAT.
THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK.


1179
00:58:37.217 --> 00:58:40.485
- OH, AND, STEVE,
THANKS FOR THE ORIOLE TICKETS.


1180
00:58:40.487 --> 00:58:42.487
- FREEBIES, ARMIN.
DON'T BE IMPRESSED.


1181
00:58:49.562 --> 00:58:52.564
- I HAPPEN TO BE
IN CHARGE HERE.


1182
00:58:57.203 --> 00:58:59.271
STOP ASKING ME
WHERE THE DEBATE IS,


1183
00:58:59.273 --> 00:59:00.939
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING.
- BEN?


1184
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:02.874
- WE ALL AGREED
ON A STARTING PLACE,


1185
00:59:02.876 --> 00:59:04.442
AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S GONNA BE,
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT


1186
00:59:04.444 --> 00:59:06.411
WHO'S GOT THE MOST, IT--
[knocking]


1187
00:59:06.413 --> 00:59:09.347
- BEN, WHO'S IN THERE
WITH YOU?


1188
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:10.549
- HEY.

1189
00:59:10.551 --> 00:59:12.417
- WERE YOU ON THE PHONE?

1190
00:59:12.419 --> 00:59:14.519
- NO.

1191
00:59:22.228 --> 00:59:26.531
- MY DIAGNOSIS, AS I WROTE,
IS CLASSIC BIPOLAR DISORDER,


1192
00:59:26.533 --> 00:59:28.533
EUPHORIC
WITH SCHIZOID TENDENCIES.


1193
00:59:28.535 --> 00:59:31.570
- [whispering]
SEE, I TOLD YOU.


1194
00:59:31.572 --> 00:59:33.572
- SO IN YOUR ASSESSMENT,
DR. VINCENT,


1195
00:59:33.574 --> 00:59:36.908
YOU SEE MR. BAKER AS BEING
INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING


1196
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:39.177
ANY CONSEQUENCES
FOR HIS ACTIONS?


1197
00:59:39.179 --> 00:59:40.979
- YES.

1198
00:59:40.981 --> 00:59:43.014
- THAT IS ALL WE HAVE TO SAY,
YOUR HONOR.


1199
00:59:43.016 --> 00:59:45.250
- UH, MR. BAKER,

1200
00:59:45.252 --> 00:59:46.918
HAVE YOU BEEN
HAVING DIFFICULTY


1201
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.987
DISTINGUISHING
BETWEEN REAL AND UNREAL?


1202
00:59:48.989 --> 00:59:50.589
- MY WHOLE LIFE.

1203
00:59:53.059 --> 00:59:54.292
- HMM.

1204
00:59:54.294 --> 00:59:56.428
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS
DIAGNOSIS.


1205
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.129
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM

1206
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:02.000
AS A DANGER TO HIMSELF
OR TO OTHER PEOPLE?


1207
01:00:02.002 --> 01:00:04.035
- ACTUALLY,
I WOULD SAY NO,


1208
01:00:04.037 --> 01:00:05.604
NOT AT THIS MOMENT.

1209
01:00:05.606 --> 01:00:08.173
IT IS, OF COURSE,
COMPLETELY POSSIBLE.


1210

1362
01:06:59.786 --> 01:07:03.488
- YEAH.
COUPLE OF STITCHES.


1363
01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:05.990
- TELL HIM I'M REALLY SORRY.

1364
01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.927
- SOLOMON,
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT


1365
01:07:09.929 --> 01:07:11.663
WHILE YOUR DAD AND I
HAVE A WORD?


1366
01:07:11.665 --> 01:07:14.832
BEN, I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.


1367
01:07:14.834 --> 01:07:16.301
- I'M GONNA GET US
SOME COFFEE.


1368
01:07:16.303 --> 01:07:18.636
I'LL RUN YOU HOME AFTER.

1369
01:07:30.716 --> 01:07:32.083
- HEY.

1370
01:07:32.085 --> 01:07:34.619
- HI.

1371
01:07:36.455 --> 01:07:38.323
- YOU EVER READ THIS SHIT?

1372
01:07:38.325 --> 01:07:41.492
I MEAN, EVERY ISSUE
IS EXACTLY THE SAME.


1373
01:07:41.494 --> 01:07:43.594
- I GUESS.

1374
01:07:43.596 --> 01:07:45.063
- I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS,

1375
01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:47.865
WHY DO YOU NEED A TOOTHBRUSH
ON A DESERT ISLAND?


1376
01:07:54.506 --> 01:07:57.442
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

1377
01:07:57.444 --> 01:08:01.412
- BECAUSE I TALK TO GOD.

1378
01:08:01.414 --> 01:08:03.781
- OH, REALLY?

1379
01:08:06.919 --> 01:08:09.087
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?

1380
01:08:09.089 --> 01:08:11.689
- ME?
I DON'T KNOW.


1381
01:08:13.659 --> 01:08:15.727
THEY WANT ME TO TAKE
SOME MEDICATION,


1382
01:08:15.729 --> 01:08:18.730
BE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

1383
01:08:25.437 --> 01:08:28.706
- SOLOMON, WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN
ON THURSDAY, OKAY?


1384
01:08:28.708 --> 01:08:31.442
- BEN, SHALL WE?

WITH SUCH A GREAT HANGOVER CURE


1399
01:10:08.775 --> 01:10:10.641
CAN BE AGAINST DRINKING.

- SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.


1403
01:10:18.651 --> 01:10:21.052
- SHE'S JUST GONNA WAIT
TILL IT DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD,

01:10:21.054 --> 01:10:22.753
WHICH MEANS IT'S OVER.

KNOWS THAT.

AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA
SAY ABOUT CITIES,

BUT IT'S ANNAPOLIS,
REALLY NOT EVEN A CITY.

01:10:33.132 --> 01:10:35.533
- WHAT ABOUT DINNER?
CAN I STAY?

DOING THE WEATHER

I MEAN, IT'S ADMIRABLE,
BUT I DON'T THINK

THE ISSUES OF HIS LIFE
ARE YOUR PROBLEM.

YOU JUST SPENT


1420
01:10:55.255 --> 01:10:57.088
THE LAST FIVE YEARS
TAKING CARE OF METHUSELAH.

IN FRIENDSHIP.

NO ONE EATS ALONE--
BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE ALONE.


1426
01:11:12.105 --> 01:11:14.038
THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP,


1427
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.207
IT'S A LOT RARER THAN LOVE,

1428

BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN IT
FOR ANYBODY.

ARE YOU KIDDING?

WITH ONE JOINT?


1493

01:17:31.017 --> 01:17:34.018
I'M BRINGING YOU THE BIGGEST
BAG OF DOPE YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'LL BE.


1498
01:17:40.693 --> 01:17:43.160
- THAT'S KIND OF OMINOUS,

1499
01:17:43.162 --> 01:17:45.162
AND BECAUSE OF ITS
NON-SEQUITUR NATURE,


1500
01:17:45.164 --> 01:17:47.097
I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT
AS A "YES" ON THE WEED.


1501
01:17:47.099 --> 01:17:49.566
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
ALL OF THIS AS CLARITY?


1502
01:17:49.568 --> 01:17:51.235
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK,
OKAY?

- SUDDENLY, YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR OWN WEED?


1504
01:17:53.339 --> 01:17:55.005
- LOOK, I'M DONE.
THAT'S IT, IT'S OVER.


1505
01:17:55.007 --> 01:17:56.707
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1506
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:58.375
- I'M TALKING ABOUT--

1507
01:17:58.377 --> 01:18:00.577
WE TOOK THE SKI LIFT
TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.


1508
01:18:00.579 --> 01:18:03.414
WE GOT OFF. YOU'RE GOING ONE WAY
AND I'M GOING THE OTHER.


1509
01:18:03.416 --> 01:18:05.649
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GO, DOWN.


1510
01:18:05.651 --> 01:18:07.051
YOU CAN'T GET ON THE LIFT
WITHOUT ME.


1511
01:18:07.053 --> 01:18:08.385
IN FACT,
YOU CAN'T EVEN SKI.


1512
01:18:08.387 --> 01:18:10.554
- I CAN SKI.

1513
01:18:10.556 --> 01:18:13.524
YOU TOLD THAT GIRL YOU COULD SKI
AND I BACKED YOU UP ON IT,


1514
01:18:13.526 --> 01:18:15.960
BUT YOU'D NEVER BEEN SKIING.
THEN YOU TOLD HER


1515
01:18:15.962 --> 01:18:18.295
YOU'D NEVER BEEN SKIING
AND YOU SOLD ME OUT, REMEMBER?


1516
01:18:18.297 --> 01:18:21.131
- FORGET ABOUT SKIING!
YOU'RE TALKING STUPID SHIT!


1517
01:18:21.133 --> 01:18:23.233
I NEED YOU TO TAKE THIS
SERIOUSLY FOR ONCE.


1518
01:18:23.235 --> 01:18:25.035
TAKE SOMETHING SERIOUSLY!

1519
01:18:25.037 --> 01:18:28.105
- OH, I GET IT. YOU'RE STRONG.
ALL HAS BEEN REVEALED.


1520
01:18:28.107 --> 01:18:29.540
- I'M JUST SAYING
THIS IS MY PROBLEM


1521
01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:31.241
AND YOU'RE EXACERBATING IT!

1522
01:18:31.243 --> 01:18:33.610
- YOU ARE TRULY BATSHIT.
- I'M SURE IT'S SCARY


1523
01:18:33.612 --> 01:18:35.980
TO TAKE FIXING ME
OFF YOUR LIST OF THINGS TO DO,


1524
01:18:35.982 --> 01:18:37.548
BECAUSE ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS FIXING YOU.


1525
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:40.484
- OH, WOW.
THANK YOU FOR THAT.


1526
01:18:40.486 --> 01:18:42.286
YEAH, 'CAUSE I'M
THE SELFISH ONE HERE.


1527
01:18:42.288 --> 01:18:44.188
THERE'S NO CHANCE
YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE.


1528
01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:47.658
- LOOK, YOU DON'T KNOW ME
AND YOU DON'T OWE ME, OKAY?


1529
01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:50.527
- WELL, IF YOU FEEL THE NEED
TO PUNCH ME IN THE BALLS,


1530
01:18:50.529 --> 01:18:53.464
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.
I'LL TRY AND CLEAR MY SCHEDULE


1531
01:18:53.466 --> 01:18:56.266
FOR THE NEXT TIME
THE CLARITY WEARS OFF.


1532
01:18:58.203 --> 01:19:01.305
[footsteps approaching]

1533
01:19:01.307 --> 01:19:03.707
- HEY.
- ARE YOU GOING?


1534
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:05.476
- YEAH, I GOTTA GET BACK.

1535
01:19:05.478 --> 01:19:07.044
- OH.

1536
01:19:07.046 --> 01:19:09.480
- I GOT THE JOB, YOU KNOW.

1537
01:19:09.482 --> 01:19:11.782
- NO, OF COURSE.

1538
01:19:11.784 --> 01:19:14.018
- YOU DON'T WANT TO WALK ME
TO THE CAR?


1539
01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.753
- WELL, IF YOU'RE LEAVING,
YOU'RE LEAVING.


1540
01:19:15.755 --> 01:19:17.388
I MEAN, I CAN CALL YOU
OR SOMETHING.


1541
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:19.189
- DO YOU NOT WANT ME TO GO?

1542
01:19:19.191 --> 01:19:21.558
- WELL, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE EASY HERE,


1543
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.294
AND NOT BECAUSE
I'M PINING FOR YOU.


1544
01:19:24.296 --> 01:19:27.097
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE.


1545
01:19:27.099 --> 01:19:31.135
YOU'RE COUNTING ON IT,
SO REALLY, YOU'RE JUST USING ME.


1546
01:19:31.137 --> 01:19:35.172
AND THROW IN THE FACT THAT
MAYBE I DO HAVE FEELINGS.


1547
01:19:35.174 --> 01:19:37.207
- OH, GOD, SO DO I.

1548
01:19:37.209 --> 01:19:38.776
- NO.

1549
01:19:38.778 --> 01:19:41.378
HALF A DAY OF SOBRIETY
ISN'T GONNA OPEN THAT DOOR.


1550
01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.114
- WELL, YOU CAN STILL
WALK ME OUTSIDE, YOU KNOW.


1551
01:19:44.116 --> 01:19:45.749
NO FUNNY BUSINESS,
I PROMISE.


1552
01:19:45.751 --> 01:19:47.451
- YOU SHOULD GO.

1553
01:19:47.453 --> 01:19:49.520
I'LL STAY HERE UNTIL I FEEL
OKAY ABOUT GOING


1554
01:19:49.522 --> 01:19:52.122
SO YOU CAN FEEL OKAY
ABOUT GOING.

¶ AH OOH OOH ¶

1560
01:20:15.381 --> 01:20:17.815
- NOW ABOUT THIS
TROPICAL DEPRESSION


1561
01:20:17.817 --> 01:20:21.085
BREWING OFF THE FLORIDA KEYS--
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL


1562
01:20:21.087 --> 01:20:24.721
IF THIS GULF AIR WILL HOLD
AND CREATE HURRICANE CONDITIONS,


1563
01:20:24.723 --> 01:20:28.092
SO VICTORIA,
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THAT.


1564
01:20:28.094 --> 01:20:31.528
- THANK YOU, STEVE.
WE CERTAINLY WILL.


1565
01:20:37.836 --> 01:20:42.406
- DALLAS? STEVE DALLAS?
- YES,<i>MEIN FUHRER.</i>


1566
01:20:42.408 --> 01:20:43.841
- YOU KNOW,
FOR A SECOND OUT THERE,


1567
01:20:43.843 --> 01:20:46.510
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOBER,
THEN I REALIZED


1568
01:20:46.512 --> 01:20:48.579
YOU'RE PROBABLY ON SOME DRUG
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.


1569
01:20:48.581 --> 01:20:50.314
- LOOK AT THIS SHIT.

1570
01:20:50.316 --> 01:20:52.816
WHY DON'T THEY JUST GET US
TUBES, LIKE ASTRONAUTS?


1571
01:20:52.818 --> 01:20:55.452
- I DON'T KNOW.
THE SANDWICHES ARE PRETTY GOOD.


1572
01:20:55.454 --> 01:20:57.121
- CHICKEN BOLOGNA?

1573
01:20:57.123 --> 01:20:58.789
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE THAT EVEN COMES FROM?


1574
01:20:58.791 --> 01:21:01.358
- YEAH, A CHICKEN.

1575
01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.828
- IT'S A LOT HARDER
THAN THAT.


1576
01:21:09.434 --> 01:21:11.535
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU PAINTED.

1577
01:21:11.537 --> 01:21:15.672
- I DON'T REALLY, BUT SOMEHOW,
TRACING THESE LINES


1578
01:21:15.674 --> 01:21:17.908
IS REALLY GONNA HELP ME
REMEMBER THIS PLACE.


1579
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:19.543
'CAUSE, LET'S FACE IT,
NEXT TIME I COME BACK,


1580
01:21:19.545 --> 01:21:20.844
IT PROBABLY WON'T BE HERE.

1581
01:21:20.846 --> 01:21:23.847
- THANKS FOR CHEERING ME UP.

1582
01:21:23.849 --> 01:21:27.551
- TRY IT.

1583
01:21:36.528 --> 01:21:39.329
- I REALLY SCREWED UP.

1584
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:44.201
- IT WASN'T IN YOUR CONTROL.

1585
01:21:44.203 --> 01:21:47.571
- GAUGUIN PACKED UP AS FAR
FROM THIS CRAP HOLE AS POSSIBLE,


1586
01:21:47.573 --> 01:21:50.908
AND THE WORLD WASN'T EVEN

1587
01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.915
- YOU FEEL LIKE PACKING UP?

1588
01:21:57.917 --> 01:22:03.654
- NO, I DON'T EVEN FEEL THAT.
I JUST FEEL LIKE...


1589
01:22:03.656 --> 01:22:06.924
IT'S A PRETTY NICE DAY,
AND I HATE MYSELF


1590
01:22:06.926 --> 01:22:11.628
FOR BEING THE GUY
THAT ONLY HAS THAT TO SAY.


1591
01:22:22.907 --> 01:22:26.210
- NEED ANOTHER CLUB SODA,
MR. DALLAS?


1592
01:22:26.212 --> 01:22:29.346
- DOES ANYONE EVER NEED
ANOTHER CLUB SODA?


1593
01:22:29.348 --> 01:22:30.747
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

1594
01:22:30.749 --> 01:22:32.716
- A REAL ESTATE SEMINAR.

1595
01:22:32.718 --> 01:22:36.386
LOT OF LADIES TRYING
TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES.


1596
01:22:42.327 --> 01:22:44.962
[inaudible conversation]

1597
01:22:58.443 --> 01:22:59.943
- IS IT GOOD?

1598
01:22:59.945 --> 01:23:01.912
- IT'S FILLED
WITH BIZARRE DETAILS


1599
01:23:01.914 --> 01:23:04.348
AND SUPER
-WEIRD BULLSHIT.

1600
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:08.252
- YOU'VE NEVER READ ANYTHING
YOU'VE LIKED THAT WAS LIKE THAT?


1601
01:23:08.254 --> 01:23:11.555
- IT'S NOT ME.
ACTUALLY, IT WAS ME.


1602
01:23:11.557 --> 01:23:13.290
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO DEPRESSING.


1603
01:23:13.292 --> 01:23:17.294
NOW IT'S JUST THIS--UNFINISHED,
UNFOCUSED, UNRELENTING.


1604
01:23:20.765 --> 01:23:23.900
I'M A GUY IN THE DESERT
WHO'S RUN TOWARDS A MIRAGE.


1605
01:23:23.902 --> 01:23:29.039
I'M STILL REALLY THIRSTY
AND MY MOUTH IS FULL OF SAND.


1606
01:23:29.041 --> 01:23:30.774
- WRITE THAT DOWN.

1607
01:23:30.776 --> 01:23:33.777
- I DON'T THINK IT'S MINE.

1608
01:23:33.779 --> 01:23:35.412
- IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME.

1609
01:23:35.414 --> 01:23:37.481
- I JUST WISH IT WAS
SOME CRIPPLING DEPRESSION,


1610
01:23:37.483 --> 01:23:39.983
INSTEAD OF THIS DISAPPOINTMENT.

1611
01:23:39.985 --> 01:23:41.585
HOW DO YOU ALL LIVE HERE
WITHOUT LOOKING


1612
01:23:41.587 --> 01:23:43.520
FOR A HIGH PLACE
TO JUMP FROM?


1613
01:23:43.522 --> 01:23:46.390
- I CAN'T SELL YOU ON LIFE.

1614
01:23:46.392 --> 01:23:50.861
- 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO IT!
[sobs]


1615
01:23:50.863 --> 01:23:57.934
NOTHING AT ALL.
[sobs]


1616
01:23:58.436 --> 01:24:02.539
- LIFE DOESN'T STAND UP
TO THINKING.


1617
01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:06.576
SMELL THE AIR OUT THERE.
THERE ARE WONDERS.


1618

ALL I FEEL IS TIME PASSING.
IT'S OVERWHELMING.


1621
01:24:22.493 --> 01:24:24.895
I WASTED SO MUCH.

1622
01:24:24.897 --> 01:24:30.033
I GOBBLED IT ALL DOWN
WITHOUT EVEN TASTING IT.


1623
01:24:30.035 --> 01:24:31.835
- SO START OVER.

1624
01:24:31.837 --> 01:24:33.870
- JUST LIKE THAT?

1625
01:25:12.143 --> 01:25:19.416
[fan whirring]

- [sighs]

1628
01:26:16.074 --> 01:26:18.475
I'M SORRY, I'M GONNA GIVE IT
TEN MORE MINUTES,


1629
01:26:18.477 --> 01:26:20.076
IF THAT'S OKAY.

1630
01:26:20.078 --> 01:26:23.079
THAT'S DECAF, RIGHT?

1631
01:26:31.923 --> 01:26:34.925
- SORRY I'M LATE.

1632
01:26:38.996 --> 01:26:41.097
- OH, MY GOD, YOU SHAVED.

1633
01:26:41.099 --> 01:26:43.733
- WHAT CAN I SAY.
YOU KNOW HOW ERRATIC I AM.


1634
01:26:43.735 --> 01:26:45.669
- WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT, BEN?


1635
01:26:45.671 --> 01:26:47.103
- ACTUALLY,
I WANTED TO THANK YOU.


1636
01:26:47.105 --> 01:26:48.705
- LOOK, I DIDN'T WAIT

1637
01:26:48.707 --> 01:26:50.207
FOR YOU TO SHOW UP
SO WE COULD HAVE A FIGHT.


1638
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:52.209
- TERRY, I MEAN IT.
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK


1639
01:26:52.211 --> 01:26:54.010
THAT EVEN THROUGH ALL THIS,

1640
01:26:54.012 --> 01:26:58.215
THAT WHAT DAD WANTED WAS FOR US
TO DEAL WITH ALL THIS TOGETHER.


1641
01:26:58.217 --> 01:27:00.884
- I'M SORRY, BUT I KNOW
YOU'RE ONLY ONE SENTENCE AWAY


1642
01:27:00.886 --> 01:27:02.819
FROM TELLING ME THAT
YOU WANT TO TURN THE STORE


1643
01:27:02.821 --> 01:27:08.158
INTO AN 1850s LAUNDROMAT THAT
RUNS ON WHALE OIL OR SOMETHING.


1644
01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.160
EXCEPT GOD FORBID
ANYBODY HURT A WHALE.


1645
01:27:10.162 --> 01:27:13.563
- [laughs]
NO.


1646
01:27:13.565 --> 01:27:15.165
I HAVE BECOME...
[chuckles]


1647
01:27:15.167 --> 01:27:17.567
ACUTELY AWARE OF MY LIMITATIONS,

1648
01:27:17.569 --> 01:27:19.870
AND I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
IS THAT


1649
01:27:19.872 --> 01:27:23.773
WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN MIND,
I'M OKAY WITH.


1650
01:27:23.775 --> 01:27:25.909
- EXCUSE ME?
ARE YOU WEARING A WIRE?


1651
01:27:25.911 --> 01:27:28.144
- I'M SERIOUS.

1652
01:27:28.146 --> 01:27:31.214
- WELL, I'VE BEEN
TOSSING AROUND THE IDEA


1653
01:27:31.216 --> 01:27:33.250
OF CONVERTING THE STORE
INTO SOMETHING MORE MODERN.


1654
01:27:33.252 --> 01:27:35.085
- AND PROFITABLE?
- IS THAT A SIN?


1655
01:27:35.087 --> 01:27:37.087
- NO, THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR,


1656
01:27:37.089 --> 01:27:38.855
BECAUSE I HAVE SOME PLANS
FOR THE FARM.


1657
01:27:38.857 --> 01:27:42.792
- WHAT, GIVE IT TO ANGELA?
[chuckles] PERFECT.


1658
01:27:42.794 --> 01:27:45.095
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT SHE HAS


1659
01:27:45.097 --> 01:27:47.297
SOME FREAKY POWER
OVER ALL THE MEN IN MY FAMILY,


1660
01:27:47.299 --> 01:27:50.100
AND THAT PROBABLY COMES
FROM UNDER HER SUNDRESS.


1661
01:27:50.102 --> 01:27:56.806
- TERRY, I'M ASKING YOU, PLEASE,
DON'T TALK ABOUT HER LIKE THAT.


1662
01:27:59.143 --> 01:28:01.912
- OKAY.

1663
01:28:03.247 --> 01:28:05.849
OKAY.

1664
01:28:05.851 --> 01:28:07.984
IT'S A MILLION DOLLARS
OF UNDEVELOPED LAND.


1665
01:28:07.986 --> 01:28:10.587
- AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HAVE
A SAY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO IT.


1666
01:28:10.589 --> 01:28:11.922
- AND YOU GET LUNCH.

1667
01:28:11.924 --> 01:28:14.624
- LOOK, WHATEVER IT TAKES.

1668
01:28:14.626 --> 01:28:18.128
I JUST DON'T WANT IT
TO BE LIKE THIS ANYMORE.


1669
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:28.271
- YOU LOOK JUST LIKE DAD.

1670
01:28:30.841 --> 01:28:34.010
- OKAY, WE FEED IN 15 SECONDS.
COME ON, PEOPLE!


1671
01:28:34.012 --> 01:28:36.246
I DON'T HAVE A FUCKING IMAGE.

1672
01:28:36.248 --> 01:28:37.948
ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS A NEWSROOM.


1673
01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:40.216
CAN I GET SOME PEOPLE
WALKING BACK AND FORTH, PLEASE?


1674
01:28:40.218 --> 01:28:42.986
AND LET'S CLEAN UP THIS--
OH, FORGET IT.


1675
01:28:42.988 --> 01:28:46.122
- THREE, TWO--

1676
01:28:46.124 --> 01:28:49.092
- AS PROMISED, WE'RE CONTINUING
TO TRACK THIS STORM,


1677
01:28:49.094 --> 01:28:50.894
NOW, FROM THE NATIONAL
WEATHER SERVICE,


1678
01:28:50.896 --> 01:28:53.196
KNOWN OFFICIALLY
AS "HURRICANE GORDON,"


1679
01:28:53.198 --> 01:28:56.866
ABOUT TO MAKE LANDFALL
JUST SOUTH OF CHARLESTON HERE.


1680
01:28:56.868 --> 01:29:00.670
EXPECT 85-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS
AND FLOODING,


1681
01:29:00.672 --> 01:29:02.172
2 TO 3 INCHES PER HOUR.

1682
01:29:02.174 --> 01:29:03.974
NOW, YOU FOLKS IN THE AREA,

1683
01:29:03.976 --> 01:29:05.976
WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT
MAKES YOU OR NOT,


1684
01:29:05.978 --> 01:29:08.044
JUST GET YOURSELVES
OUT OF THERE.


1685
01:29:08.046 --> 01:29:10.847
YOUR LIVES ARE A HELL OF A LOT
MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR HOUSES.


1686
01:29:10.849 --> 01:29:14.651
THIS IS STEVE DALLAS
IN THE CHANNEL 18 STORM CENTER.


1687
01:29:14.653 --> 01:29:17.988
STAY DRY AND STAY SAFE.

1688
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:19.689
- AND WE'RE OUT.

1689
01:29:19.691 --> 01:29:21.891
- NICELY DONE! YES!

1690
01:29:21.893 --> 01:29:24.394
I LOVE THAT BIT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
DOWN IN CHARLESTON.


1691
01:29:24.396 --> 01:29:26.162
OUR LOCAL OLD LADIES
ARE GONNA CREAM!


1692
01:29:26.164 --> 01:29:28.898
- AND FROM WHAT DELIA TELLS ME,
THIS IS HELL OF A STORM.


1693
01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.800
THOSE PEOPLE NEEDED
TO BE WARNED.


1694
01:29:30.802 --> 01:29:33.870
- YEAH, WELL, THOSE PEOPLE
LOST POWER SIX HOURS AGO.


1695
01:29:33.872 --> 01:29:36.306
THEY'RE NOT WATCHING TV.

1696
01:29:36.308 --> 01:29:38.975
- JESUS. REALLY?

1697
01:29:38.977 --> 01:29:40.977
SO WHY THE HELL ARE WE
DOING THIS?


1698
01:29:40.979 --> 01:29:44.080
- LOCAL PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED.
THEY MIGHT RUN US NATIONAL,


1699
01:29:44.082 --> 01:29:47.784
UNLESS THOSE DOUCHEBAGS
IN BALTIMORE SNAKE US AGAIN.


1700
01:29:54.225 --> 01:29:56.893
- I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.
- OH.


1701
01:29:56.895 --> 01:30:00.196
I'M JUST GOING THROUGH SOME
OF YOUR DAD'S STUFF.


1702
01:30:00.198 --> 01:30:03.299
I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE BURIED HIM
IN HIS MADRAS SHORTS.


1703
01:30:03.301 --> 01:30:06.102
WOULD HAVE FELT
MORE LIKE A VACATION.


1704
01:30:06.104 --> 01:30:08.204
- I TALKED TO TERRY
LIKE YOU SUGGESTED.


1705
01:30:08.206 --> 01:30:10.774
- IT WASN'T BAD, RIGHT?
- IT WAS GREAT.


1706
01:30:10.776 --> 01:30:14.077
AND, UM,
THE OTHER NIGHT TOO.


1707
01:30:15.946 --> 01:30:17.947
THAT REALLY HAPPENED,
DIDN'T IT?


1708
01:30:17.949 --> 01:30:21.117
- YES. YES, IT DID.

1709
01:30:21.119 --> 01:30:22.986
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH THAT MEANT.


1710
01:30:22.988 --> 01:30:26.222
- WELL, SOMEONE HAD TO
WELCOME YOU BACK TO THE WORLD.


1711
01:30:29.927 --> 01:30:33.163
- HOW DID YOU END UP
WITH MY DAD?


1712
01:30:33.165 --> 01:30:40.170
- UH...
I GUESS IT WAS ALL THIS.


1713
01:30:40.172 --> 01:30:43.707
IT'S HARD TO RESIST
THE TEMPTATION


1714
01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:46.376
TO STEP INTO A NORMAL LIFE.

1715
01:30:46.378 --> 01:30:49.145
- I KNOW YOU TOLD DAD
YOU DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING.


1716
01:30:49.147 --> 01:30:52.315
- YEAH, I SAID THAT,
AND I REALLY MEANT IT,


1717
01:30:52.317 --> 01:30:55.151
BUT YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE
JUST GIVEN ME


1718
01:30:55.153 --> 01:30:57.220
JUST, LIKE, ONE LITTLE THING.

1719
01:30:57.222 --> 01:31:01.825
ANYTHING, JUST FOR SENTIMENTAL
REASONS, A GESTURE.


1720
01:31:01.827 --> 01:31:03.426
- WELL, YOU DESERVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.


1721
01:31:03.428 --> 01:31:06.329
I COULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO--
- NO, NO, NO.


1722
01:31:06.331 --> 01:31:08.732
[laughs]
NOT FROM YOU.


1723
01:31:08.734 --> 01:31:12.335
I MEAN, IT'S SWEET, THANK YOU,
BUT...


1724
01:31:12.337 --> 01:31:14.370
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

1725
01:31:14.372 --> 01:31:17.006
- I THOUGHT, SINCE YOU KNOW,
YOU DIDN'T KNOW


1726
01:31:17.008 --> 01:31:19.008
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO,
THAT YOU COULD TALK TO STEVE


1727
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:20.910
ABOUT THE FARM AND THE HOUSE.

1728
01:31:20.912 --> 01:31:22.245
I'M SURE HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO EITHER.


1729
01:31:22.247 --> 01:31:23.947
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1730
01:31:23.949 --> 01:31:26.783
- I'M GIVING THIS ALL
TO DALLAS.


1731
01:31:26.785 --> 01:31:28.485
- WHAT?

1732
01:31:28.487 --> 01:31:31.121
- I PROMISED IT TO HIM
AFTER THE WILL.


1733
01:31:31.123 --> 01:31:35.759
- HUH. [chuckles]
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.


1734
01:31:35.761 --> 01:31:38.194
- IT'S AN ODD MARRIAGE,
BUT I KIND OF OWED IT TO HIM.


1735
01:31:38.196 --> 01:31:42.432
WHY? DID YOU WANT IT?
- NO. MM-MMM.


1736
01:31:42.434 --> 01:31:46.870
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- SURE. YOU?


1737
01:31:46.872 --> 01:31:49.339
- YEAH. TERRY'S GONNA HELP ME
FIND A SMALLER PLACE.


1738
01:31:53.077 --> 01:31:56.045
I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW YOU
HELD THIS FAMILY TOGETHER.


1739
01:32:14.031 --> 01:32:16.232
[beep]
- IT'S ME.


1740
01:32:16.234 --> 01:32:17.534
I HOPE I'M USING THIS RIGHT.

1741
01:32:17.536 --> 01:32:19.235
IT KEEPS ASKING ME
TO PRESS STAR,


1742
01:32:19.237 --> 01:32:22.105
WHICH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
ON THIS PHONE.


1743
01:32:22.107 --> 01:32:23.873
OH, THERE IT IS.
LISTEN, MAN--


1744
01:32:23.875 --> 01:32:26.476
[beep]

1745
01:32:26.478 --> 01:32:28.244
LISTEN, MAN,
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED.


1746
01:32:28.246 --> 01:32:30.113
I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT
BECAUSE IT KEEPS CUTTING ME OFF.


1747
01:32:30.115 --> 01:32:32.882
I MISS YOU.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THINGS,


1748
01:32:32.884 --> 01:32:34.517
AND I WANT TO MAKE GOOD
ON THINGS,


1749
01:32:34.519 --> 01:32:39.289
AND I KNOW ANGELA MISS--
[beep]


1750
01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:41.291
OKAY, NOW, I GOTTA TALK FAST
'CAUSE IF I STOP TALKING,


1751
01:32:41.293 --> 01:32:43.126
THE THING WILL CUT ME OFF.
ALL I WANTED TO SAY WAS


1752
01:32:43.128 --> 01:32:45.161
COME DOWN IF YOU'RE EVER FREE,
AND I'M GOOD. BYE.


1753
01:32:45.163 --> 01:32:46.529
[beep]

1754
01:32:46.531 --> 01:32:49.465
[dialing beeps]

1755
01:32:49.467 --> 01:32:52.202
HELLO--
[beeps]


1756
01:32:54.038 --> 01:32:56.906
- MORNING, SLUGGER.
FOUR REPORTS IN SIX HOURS,


1757
01:32:56.908 --> 01:32:58.408
A STATION MANAGER'S WET DREAM.

1758
01:32:58.410 --> 01:33:01.044
YOU GOT TWO HOURS TO GET
CLEANED UP FOR YOUR 12:30.


1759
01:33:01.046 --> 01:33:04.280
- THAT'S IT, I'M DONE.
- WHAT?


1760
01:33:04.282 --> 01:33:07.483
- I THINK IT'S TIME YOU FIND
A NEW ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER,


1761
01:33:07.485 --> 01:33:11.154
SOMEONE WHO'S COMFORTABLE WITH
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME THIS IS,


1762
01:33:11.156 --> 01:33:12.956
SOMEONE WHO ISN'T AWARE
OF THE FACT


1763
01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:16.259
THAT ANY SIX-YEAR-OLD CAN
STICK THEIR ARM OUT THE WINDOW


1764
01:33:16.261 --> 01:33:19.128
AND TELL YOU
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE TODAY.


1765
01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:23.900
DAVE, I WOULD LIKE
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO DELIA,


1766
01:33:23.902 --> 01:33:25.602
AN ACTUAL METEOROLOGIST,

1767
01:33:25.604 --> 01:33:28.304
AND YES, SHE DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE MISS AMERICA,


1768
01:33:28.306 --> 01:33:31.574
SHE LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WHO WENT
TO M.I.T., BECAUSE SHE DID.


1769
01:33:31.576 --> 01:33:34.010
- CAN'T YOU EVER
JUST MAKE IT EASY?


1770
01:33:34.012 --> 01:33:37.280
DO YOU HAVE TO SUCK THE GOOD
OUT OF EVERYTHING?


1771
01:33:37.282 --> 01:33:40.516
- GOOD LUCK, SWEETHEART.

1772
01:33:40.518 --> 01:33:42.518
- [scoffs]

1773
01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.356
- HE KISSED ME.

1774
01:33:46.358 --> 01:33:49.359
[upbeat rock music]

1775
01:33:49.361 --> 01:33:56.432
¶ ¶

1776
01:34:11.382 --> 01:34:13.416
- "AMISH FARMS SUPER STORE"?

1777
01:34:13.418 --> 01:34:15.551
- YES, BUT
WITHOUT THE QUESTION MARK.


1778
01:34:15.553 --> 01:34:18.588
- IF YOU BELIEVED IN ANYTHING,
YOU WOULD REALIZE


1779
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:20.223
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE GO TO HELL.

1780
01:34:20.225 --> 01:34:21.591
- HAVE YOU TALKED TO BEN?

1781
01:34:21.593 --> 01:34:24.227
- BEN AGREED TO THIS?
UNDERGROUND PARKING?


1782
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:27.063
- HONESTLY, WE SPOKE
IN RATIONAL MEANS AS A FAMILY,


1783
01:34:27.065 --> 01:34:29.098
AND THIS WAS THE DECISION
THAT WE MADE,


1784
01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.301
AND LUCKILY FOR BOTH OF US,
YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE FAMILY.


1785
01:34:31.303 --> 01:34:33.970
- NO, NO, CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU WON, AND I DON'T MEAN


1786
01:34:33.972 --> 01:34:36.506
THE BATTLE OVER THE WILL, I MEAN
FOR BIGGEST TWAT OF THE YEAR.


1787
01:34:36.508 --> 01:34:39.642
- BOY, YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO A WOMAN


1788
01:34:39.644 --> 01:34:41.344
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO SCREW.

1789
01:34:41.346 --> 01:34:44.147
BEN AND I RECONCILED,
AND YOUR OPPOSITION TO THAT


1790
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:46.549
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU
JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE


1791
01:34:46.551 --> 01:34:49.585
IN WHATEVER WEED-POWERED DANCE
YOU TWO HAVE SHARED


1792
01:34:49.587 --> 01:34:51.421
FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS.

1793
01:34:51.423 --> 01:34:53.256
- I WANT HIM TO GET BETTER.

1794
01:34:53.258 --> 01:34:56.359
- THEN FOR ONCE,
LEAVE HIM BE!


1795
01:34:56.361 --> 01:34:59.662
HE'S GOING TO HAVE
A LIFETIME OF PROSPERITY,


1796
01:34:59.664 --> 01:35:02.498
AND I'M SURE HE AND ANGELA
WILL BE VERY HAPPY.


1797
01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.968
- WHAT?

1798
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:08.271
- MAYBE IT'S SICK,
BUT THOSE TWO FOUND EACH OTHER.


1799
01:35:08.273 --> 01:35:11.140
I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD,
BUT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE


1800
01:35:11.142 --> 01:35:14.010
THAT MY BROTHER AND
MY STEPMOTHER BELONG TOGETHER.


1801
01:35:14.012 --> 01:35:17.113
- WHAT, THEY'RE TOGETHER?
SAYS WHO?


1802
01:35:17.115 --> 01:35:19.549
- OH. STEVE, THEY ARE.

1803
01:35:19.551 --> 01:35:21.484
SORRY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIND SOMEONE ELSE


1804
01:35:21.486 --> 01:35:23.453
WHO'S IN WORSE SHAPE

I THINK SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

- I GUESS NOTHING'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

YOU GOT THE FARM.
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?

WHO EVEN TAKE THE SHIT YOU'RE ON
EVER STAY ON IT?


1954
01:45:18.883 --> 01:45:20.716
- I DEFER
TO YOUR DRUG EXPERTISE.


1955
01:45:20.718 --> 01:45:22.151
- WHY'D YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH HER


1956
01:45:22.153 --> 01:45:23.786
AND RUIN EVERYTHING FOR ME?

1957
01:45:23.788 --> 01:45:25.821
- I DIDN'T FALL IN LOVE
WITH HER.


1958
01:45:25.823 --> 01:45:28.757
- THAT'S WORSE!
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING.


1959
01:45:28.759 --> 01:45:30.793
- NO, YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!

1960
01:45:30.795 --> 01:45:33.195
FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT IN LOVE
WITH HER, AND I NEVER WAS.


1961
01:45:33.197 --> 01:45:36.966
- BUT YOU SLEPT WITH HER ANYWAY?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?


1962
01:45:36.968 --> 01:45:38.934
OKAY, LET'S SAY
I UNDERSTAND THAT.


1963
01:45:38.936 --> 01:45:40.302
- BUT YOU DON'T.

1964
01:45:40.304 --> 01:45:43.172
SHE HELPED ME,
LET ME FEEL SOMETHING AGAIN.


1965
01:45:43.174 --> 01:45:46.709
- SO SHE MAKES ME STOP
GETTING HIGH, BUT YOU GET SEX?


1966
01:45:46.711 --> 01:45:50.312
WHAT A SHITTY, SHITTY DEAL,
AND FOR WHAT?


1967
01:45:50.314 --> 01:45:52.815
FOR THIS?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?


1968
01:45:52.817 --> 01:45:54.216
- I'M STILL ME.

1969
01:45:54.218 --> 01:45:56.318
- BULLSHIT. YOU'RE BEN LITE!

1970
01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:59.188
- I'M BEN PRIME. I'M STILL
THE SAME GUY FROM SIXTH GRADE!


1971
01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:03.058
- NO.

1972
01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:05.995
MAN, YOU'RE A MILLION MILES
AWAY FROM THAT KID.


1973
01:46:05.997 --> 01:46:08.697
- I SWEAR, THIS ISN'T BAD.

1974
01:46:08.699 --> 01:46:11.834
I'M JUST FUNCTIONING NOW
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.


1975
01:46:14.904 --> 01:46:17.072
- SO THIS IS IT?

1976
01:46:17.074 --> 01:46:20.709
- WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLD.


1977
01:46:20.711 --> 01:46:23.846
WE KEEP LOOKING AND GRABBING
AND EATING AND SMOKING


1978
01:46:23.848 --> 01:46:27.182
AND NEVER STOP TO THINK,

1979
01:46:27.184 --> 01:46:29.985
"WHO COULD WANT
MORE THAN THIS?"


1980
01:46:29.987 --> 01:46:37.059

1981
01:46:42.165 --> 01:46:46.201
