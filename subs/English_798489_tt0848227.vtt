00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.148
When I was a boy of nine, I read a book
called The Malay Archipelago,


2
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.599
by the great 19th century naturalist,

3
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.910
the co-proposer with Charles Darwin

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.988
of the theory of evolution
by natural selection,


5
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.238
Alfred Russel Wallace. This is it.

6
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.858
And in it he describes his travels
and explorations


7
00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:35.788
through Borneo and Sumatra,

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.788
eastwards through the islands
that are now Indonesia


9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.510
to the western end of New Guinea.

10
00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:46.709
And in it, I saw one illustration
that thrilled me to the marrow.


11
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.599
It shows greater birds of paradise
displaying in the forests of New Guinea


12
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.999
and being hunted
by native plume hunters.


13
00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.400
It seemed to me then as now, that to see
the greater bird of paradise in display


14
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.709
must be one of the most thrilling sights
in nature.


15
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.159
And it became my childhood ambition
to go and do just that.


16
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.469
Well, it's taken me 60 years,
but here I am.


17
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.549
(People chattering)

18
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.120
I first tried to see
the birds back in 1957.

19
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.998
But then
I could only get to eastern New Guinea,


20
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.799
where the species Wallace saw
doesn't occur.


21
00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:43.710
And there was another problem -
the people used the plumes as money.


22
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.159
These are wedding gifts - pearl shells,
mats sewn with cowrie shells


23
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.230
but, most valuable of all
birds of paradise skins,


24
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.790
prepared in the traditional way by cutting
off the legs and the wings,


25
00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:59.829
to fully reveal the plumes.
There were 21 of them.


26
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.269
The bride seemed pleased, but for us,
looking for live birds,


27
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.960
there was worse to come -

28
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.990
a celebratory dance.

29
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.140
Each man wore plumes
of at least 40 birds of paradise,


30
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.468
of several different kinds.

31
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.468
Most astonishing were the sawtooth
quills they wore through the nose.


32
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.628
These came from
the King of Saxony's bird, that then,


33
00:02:24.718 --> 00:02:28.150
very few naturalists had even seen alive.

34
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.310
There seemed little chance of finding
living birds here,


35
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.150
so we decided to go into wilder country
to the north.


36
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.920
The headman called for porters.

37
00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:40.270
We got 50. Once in the mountains,

38
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.628
our baggage was taken over by people
who didn't wear feathers in their hair.


39
00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:51.229
Instead, they had huge wigs,
covered with bark cloth.


40
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.998
We heard calls of birds of paradise,
we glimpsed them high in the trees,


41
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.960
but we couldn't find a place
where we could film them.


42
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.960
And then, after three weeks
one morning at dawn,


43
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.800
our luck changed.

44
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.520
Low down, in a casuarina tree

45
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.520
a plumed bird of paradise.

46
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.990
And there, his unplumed female.

47
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.560
With these pictures,
we had achieved something.


48
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.158
As far as I knew
this was the first film ever taken


49
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.229
of a bird of paradise
displaying in the wild.


50
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.998
But our film was not in colour

51
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.680
the species was smaller than the one
that Wallace had seen


52
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.520
and there were not
a dozen dancing birds,


53
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.199
there was just one.

54
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.628
This was hardly the fulfilment
of that boyhood ambition.


55
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.390
But now, 40 years on, 
I'm trying again.

56
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.278
Wallace arrived in the Far East in 1854

57
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.640
but it was three years before he caught
the first glimpse


58
00:03:57.718 --> 00:03:59.270
of a living bird of paradise.

59
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.998
And even then
it must have been a very distant one.


60
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.800
For, as he wrote, the birds only display
in the loftiest of trees.


61
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.759
And they are doing so in this one,
right here.


62
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.740
I reckon they are at least a hundred feet
above the ground.


63
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.920
Even with modern binoculars, it isn't
easy to see exactly what they are doing.


64
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.430
As far as I know
Wallace wasn't able to climb the tree


65
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.720
to get a closer view of the birds,

66
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.879
but these days we've got ways
of doing so relatively simply.


67
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.120
You fire a thin line, with a catapult,
over one of those high branches,


68
00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.189
haul up a thicker rope,
attach a system of counterweights,


69
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.160
then all you have to do,
is to clip yourself on, and up you go.


70
00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:16.949
Down goes the counterweight.

71
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.560
And now, I'm leaving that dark world
of the forest floor


72
00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.310
and really entering
a completely new one.


73
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.519
Now I'm getting up into the canopy.

74
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.800
Into the world of the birds of paradise.

75
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.720
And here's the top.

76
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.040
The birds are in another emergent tree,
just like this one,


77
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.629
and I've got an absolutely clear view
of them.


78
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.959
It's unlikely
that they're going to take fright


79
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.199
at my sudden appearance
above the canopy,


80
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.720
because they've been using that tree
for generation after generation,


81
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.588
and it will take a lot more than just me
to put them off it.


82
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.509
This, at last
is Wallace's picture come to life.


83
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.480
He was the first European to glimpse this
extraordinary spectacle,


84
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.670
and he knew well
in general terms, what was happening.


85
00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.588
This is a female
and she's come to pick a mate


86
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.870
from among the gorgeous males
who are displaying.


87
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.189
A young male. He's dancing even though
he hasn't yet got his plumes.


88
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.439
They don't develop
until he's six or seven years old.


89
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.360
There are several young males here,
putting in a little dancing practice.


90
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.360
This, however
is almost certainly a female,


91
00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.949
because the males are starting
the second stage of their performance -


92
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.280
the bow, head down.

93
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.550
The female has hopped onto the perch
of the male of her choice -


94
00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.310
that's a straight invitation to mate.

95
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.680
Act Ill - the approach.

96
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.709
Head up.

97
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.160
Act IV - the first physical contact.

98
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.148
It looks rough, but presumably she likes
this sort of treatment.


99
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.829
She could easily move away if she didn't.

100
00:08:35.478 --> 00:08:37.430
And that's it.

101
00:08:42.358 --> 00:08:44.660
And now there's another
to be attended to.


102
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.118
Apparently, there's a queue
on this particular perch.


103
00:09:00.718 --> 00:09:03.180
This is all he does as a father.

104
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.959
Now she'll fly away
and raise her young unaided.


105
00:09:10.598 --> 00:09:13.790
The males on the other perches,
in spite of all their efforts,


106
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.000
have no success at all.

107
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.228
He's at it again!

108
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.228
But his partner is not reacting properly.

109
00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:32.310
She's facing away from him.

110
00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:37.750
He's got it wrong,
this is a young male.

111
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.030
All the matings are taking place
on this perch, with this male.


112
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.160
But are the females choosing the perch
or the dancer?


113
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.199
It's difficult to tell.

114
00:09:50.838 --> 00:09:53.588
But it's easy to see
why these wonderful plumes


115
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.978
should be so treasured by local people,

116
00:09:56.079 --> 00:10:00.829
and why, when the first examples
arrived in Europe in the 16th century,


117
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.000
they should have created a sensation,
as they did.


118
00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:08.829
Those first specimens
had been prepared in the traditional way,


119
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:14.000
and had neither wings nor feet, and the
books of the time showed them that way.


120
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.949
But how could such creatures
fly or perch?


121
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.880
This book explained.
The birds had no need to do either


122
00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:25.069
because they floated in the sky,
feeding on dew,


123
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.838
and only fell to earth when they died.

124
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.310
They were literally birds of paradise.

125
00:10:31.718 --> 00:10:35.790
Even 200 years later, the illustrations
involved a lot of guesswork.


126
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.000
For still no European
had seen the living birds.


127
00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:41.829
This kind, for example,
had not only feathers,


128
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.598
but 12 long, naked quills
sprouting from its flanks.


129
00:10:46.598 --> 00:10:51.228
The artist did give it legs, but he was
completely baffled by the plumes.


130
00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:56.310
By the end of the 19th century, thanks to
the discoveries of Wallace and others


131
00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.000
the illustrations are much more accurate.

132
00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:02.189
This is that 12-quilled bird again.

133
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:06.560
But could it really have its strange quills,
or wires, as they're called,


134
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.000
bent back over its body like this?

135
00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:10.829
It seems hardly likely.

136
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.760
Perhaps the artist had been working
from a specimen


137
00:11:13.838 --> 00:11:15.468
that had been badly packed.

138
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.310
And what about this?

139
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.160
This is the sicklebill bird of paradise.

140
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:26.000
Could it, in life, have great fans of
plumes projecting above its wings,


141
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.670
like fancy epaulettes with a purple rim?

142
00:11:36.439 --> 00:11:39.949
Even today,
some of these species are little-known.


143
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.069
Many display in the thick forest at dawn,
when there is not enough light to film.


144
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.560
That was what had caused us
such problems 40 years ago.


145
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.118
But now we can resolve that difficulty
with special video cameras.


146
00:11:53.199 --> 00:11:55.630
And one of the species
I most wanted to see


147
00:11:55.718 --> 00:11:59.829
is that bird with the improbable
epaulettes, the black sicklebill.


148
00:12:00.838 --> 00:12:04.790
Its display in the wild
has never been photographed or filmed,


149
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.598
it hasn't even been scientifically
described.


150
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:14.390
But the local people say that a male
does display on a perch just near here,


151
00:12:14.478 --> 00:12:19.030
but it only does so at first light,
just before dawn.


152
00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:24.510
So the only thing to do,
is to sit down and wait.


153
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.280
He's there!
That dim, black shape on the sapling.


154
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.238
This really is seeing in the dark.

155
00:12:43.838 --> 00:12:45.390
(Calling)

156
00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:50.790
He's calling to attract females,
but also to keep other males away.


157
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.199
This is his territory
and he'll dance by himself.


158
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.030
Those things like arms are not his wings,
they're those epaulettes.


159
00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:07.030
So that's what he does with them!

160
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.000
It's even more unlikely than the drawing.

161
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.800
It's getting brighter.

162
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.838
Soon we should be able to see him
just a little more clearly.


163
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.478
There's that purple line on the epaulette.

164
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.319
But there's still no sign of a female.

165
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.868
Ah, well, obviously time for breakfast.

166
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.160
A pandanus tree. Sicklebills
are particularly fond of its fruit,


167
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.478
and there's lots of it around.

168
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.238
That's what he's after - and there's
a female half-hidden in the leaves.


169
00:14:44.598 --> 00:14:46.189
There's a second female.

170
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.319
A third!

171
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.358
All three are almost certainly his mates,

172
00:15:01.439 --> 00:15:05.390
each building her own nest
and feeding in his territory.


173
00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:12.709
Many birds of paradise species
have females coloured like this -


174
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.959
brown above
and speckled or barred beneath.


175
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.000
And looking at them, it's easy to see
that they're all related,


176
00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:23.829
even though their males
are so very different and various.


177
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.040
The New Guinea forest
has an atmosphere all its own.


178
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.838
From one point of view,
it's rather disappointing -


179
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.520
you don't see many mammals, far fewer
than in Africa or South American forests.


180
00:15:38.598 --> 00:15:42.709
But what this place lacks in mammals,
it makes up for in birds.


181
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.838
Not that it's all
that easy to see them.

182
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.598
You know they're around
because you can hear them,


183
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.348
but if you want to watch them,
you have to move fairly quietly.


184
00:16:02.358 --> 00:16:05.348
And there is one of the smallest
of the whole family.


185
00:16:05.439 --> 00:16:08.978
This is the one with those extraordinary
sawtooth plumes -


186
00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:11.030
the King of Saxony's bird.

187
00:16:16.718 --> 00:16:21.348
There's nothing else remotely like these
plumes in the whole of the bird world.


188
00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:34.030
He's calling for a female.

189
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.079
And it's not just his plumes that are
unique - so is his way of dancing.


190
00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:49.030
(Soft hissing)

191
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.160
That hissing noise is his call.

192
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.959
You can tell he's getting
particularly excited


193
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.720
because he's erected the black feathers
on his shoulders into a cape,


194
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.190
another of those transformation tricks

195
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.848
that seem to be a speciality
of this family.


196
00:17:19.158 --> 00:17:23.108
He's so worked up,
he's trying to mate with a tuft of moss!


197
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.440
A female, at last.

198
00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:49.470
Typical female colouring.

199
00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:51.148
And that's never been filmed before.

200
00:18:59.319 --> 00:19:01.069
New Guinea is a huge island.

201
00:19:01.158 --> 00:19:06.069
A thousand miles long from east to west,
lying between Australia and the equator.


202
00:19:06.158 --> 00:19:10.148
It was rucked up from beneath the sea
some 10,000,000 years ago,


203
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.040
as Australia drifted northwards

204
00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:15.819
and pushed against the Asian section
of the earth's crust.


205
00:19:15.918 --> 00:19:20.108
The ancestors of the birds of paradise,
probably starling-like creatures,


206
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.908
slowly spread from Asia,
down chains of smaller islands


207
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.000
until they reached these vast forests.

208
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.440
And here, they evolved into
a multitude of wildly different species,


209
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.040
that, between them, exploit every kind
of feather adornment you can imagine.


210
00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:43.020
But why did this great diversity
of species come into existence?


211
00:19:43.118 --> 00:19:46.790
Well, New Guinea
as well as being an immense island,


212
00:19:46.878 --> 00:19:49.310
is also an extremely varied one.

213
00:19:49.398 --> 00:19:55.030
Up here, I'm at 11,000 feet, and the land
is much poorer in food for birds


214
00:19:55.118 --> 00:20:00.190
than the luxuriant tropical rainforests
of lower altitudes.


215
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.280
And up here,
there lives a bird of paradise


216
00:20:03.358 --> 00:20:08.510
that may give us a clue about
the ancestors of the whole family.


217
00:20:10.398 --> 00:20:11.950
McGregor's bird of paradise.

218
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.960
And there's an obvious way in which
it differs from most of its relations.


219
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.668
This is a pair - male and female
look exactly the same.


220
00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:29.540
The reason they do so
is connected with food.


221
00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:34.470
There's so little of it up here,
that if nestlings are to get enough,


222
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.270
the male has to help the female
to collect it.


223
00:20:38.358 --> 00:20:40.348
So he can't have a lot of wives.

224
00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:41.918
Just one.

225
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.358
And since he can't, therefore
spend his time dancing in trees,


226
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.838
he hasn't developed an extravagant
costume in which to show off.


227
00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:55.230
His courtship is no more than
this quick chase through the bushes.


228
00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.040
At lower altitudes
things are very different.


229
00:21:09.118 --> 00:21:13.868
The tropical heat and the heavy rains
produce a really rich environment.


230
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:18.440
As there are no monkeys to munch
the fruit or squirrels to gather the seeds,


231
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.200
there's plenty of food for birds.

232
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.720
Here the females can raise their young
unaided


233
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.760
and the males can concentrate
on dancing.


234
00:21:26.838 --> 00:21:29.470
And since there are no cats or jackals,

235
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.790
there's little danger in doing so
on the ground.


236
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.829
The superb bird of paradise
does just that.


237
00:21:36.918 --> 00:21:40.108
And this log is his dancing stage.

238
00:21:42.598 --> 00:21:44.668
As well as his spectacular cravat,

239
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.040
he's got a long sheaf of feathers
at the back of his neck.


240
00:21:48.118 --> 00:21:51.550
Extraordinary in itself,
but you wait till he unfurls it!


241
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.918
Here's the female.
Now there'll be some action.


242
00:22:35.358 --> 00:22:38.898
This is the arena
of another displaying bird.


243
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.480
I'm not on the mainland
I've come to the island of Batanta


244
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.388
which is separated
by quite a narrow strait.


245
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.319
But it has its own species
of bird of paradise,


246
00:22:49.398 --> 00:22:51.780
that evolved here
and lives nowhere else.


247
00:22:51.878 --> 00:22:54.628
And one way of trying
to get a look at it,

248
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.398
is to put some leaves on this arena,

249
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:03.319
because this bird is meticulously tidy.

250
00:23:13.638 --> 00:23:18.428
This isn't him. 
This is a pheasant pigeon.

251
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:24.800
Maybe a trespasser on his patch will so
infuriate him that he will come down.


252
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.319
(Bird calling)

253
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.678
(Calling continues)

254
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.720
I can hear his calls.

255
00:23:38.118 --> 00:23:39.668
There he is.

256
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.720
(Calling)

257
00:23:42.598 --> 00:23:44.668
Wilson's bird of paradise.

258
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.480
He's got his own fashion gimmick -
the bald look.


259
00:23:53.838 --> 00:23:57.148
There goes the first
of the leaves that I dropped.


260
00:24:00.838 --> 00:24:04.668
He's really quite small -
only the size of a starling.


261
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.560
Now he's starting cutting leaves.

262
00:24:40.638 --> 00:24:42.750
Littering the place up himself.

263
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:52.358
Presumably he wants to get more light
on the stage,


264
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.878
so that his colours show up.

265
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.280
That looks like a female.

266
00:25:20.358 --> 00:25:24.750
She's got a slightly less brilliant
blue head.


267
00:25:38.358 --> 00:25:40.510
But that's a young male.

268
00:25:40.598 --> 00:25:46.230
He's not yet got coloured feathers on his
body, but his bald head is very blue,


269
00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:48.668
and he's behaving like a male too.

270
00:25:50.118 --> 00:25:53.790
ls he helping the boss
by doing a bit of the housework?


271
00:25:53.878 --> 00:25:55.470
Probably not.

272
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.338
It's more likely he's come here
to practise the skills he's going to need


273
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.908
when he's old enough
to have an arena of his own.


274
00:26:08.598 --> 00:26:10.550
She looks interested.

275
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.960
So does he.

276
00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.440
(Calling)

277
00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.858
He's clearly not much of a dancer.

278
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.800
But with a costume like that
who would need to be?


279
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.918
What an amazing bird!

280
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.040
I've seen lots of coloured illustrations
of them


281
00:27:28.118 --> 00:27:30.550
I've seen mounted specimens
in museums


282
00:27:30.638 --> 00:27:34.790
but nothing has prepared me
for the splendour of this wonderful thing.


283
00:27:34.878 --> 00:27:40.000
It's as though it's illuminated from
inside, the colours are incandescent.


284
00:27:41.358 --> 00:27:47.230
When Wallace collected
a particularly spectacular specimen,


285
00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:53.418
he wrote in his book, "My heart began to
beat violently, blood rushed to my head,


286
00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.280
"and I felt more in danger of fainting

287
00:27:56.358 --> 00:28:00.550
"than when I had been in apprehension
of immediate death.


288
00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:03.510
"I had a headache
for the rest of the day."


289
00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:08.108
Well, I haven't got a headache,
but I think I know how he felt.


290
00:28:16.158 --> 00:28:20.030
Half a dozen of the 40-odd species
dance on the ground like that.


291
00:28:20.118 --> 00:28:25.060
To find another, we left the island of
Batanta and went back to the mainland


292
00:28:25.158 --> 00:28:28.030
to the Arfak mountains
in western New Guinea.


293
00:28:28.118 --> 00:28:30.148
The home of the Arfak parrotia.

294
00:28:34.598 --> 00:28:36.790
This is his display ground.

295
00:28:36.878 --> 00:28:39.790
Here too the forest floor
has been cleared


296
00:28:39.878 --> 00:28:42.868
and the saplings stripped of their leaves.

297
00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:48.319
He's dressed entirely in black, except for
that white disc on his forehead.


298
00:28:48.398 --> 00:28:51.310
Though there is a iridescent patch
on his chest


299
00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:53.510
that he can reveal when he wants to.

300
00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:56.710
And he does have
those six black pennants on his head.


301
00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:00.480
But he dazzles his mates
not so much with his costum' e


302
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.588
as with his choreography.

303
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:08.040
And that being so, he is particularly keen
on clearing his stage


304
00:29:08.118 --> 00:29:11.388
of anything that might trip up a dancer.

305
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:35.760
Now he's miming, going through the
motions of clearing away leaves,


306
00:29:35.838 --> 00:29:37.790
even though there aren't any.

307
00:29:43.838 --> 00:29:47.270
The stage is now absolutely immaculate.

308
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.990
And here's another of those juveniles

309
00:29:57.079 --> 00:30:01.108
who come to the arenas
of their elders and betters to practise.


310
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.190
Amazing! But how sad
that none of the girls are here to watch.


311
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.470
The master is back.

312
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.040
An audience is assembling.

313
00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.348
He is going to show
how it should be done.


314
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:06.079
First, the warm-up - ritualised runs
across the stage.


315
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.560
A little more mimed leaf-clearing.

316
00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:25.270
Mounting excitement in the dress circle.

317
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.079
And now, the performance begins.

318
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.720
The absence of ground predators,

319
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.158
that has allowed some birds of paradise
to display on the ground,


320
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.678
has been exploited
by another family of birds,


321
00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:44.240
that used to be thought to be
close cousins of the birds of paradise,


322
00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:47.069
but are now thought to be
somewhat distantly related.


323
00:32:47.158 --> 00:32:49.720
and this is one of their constructions.

324
00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.348
This is not a
nest, it's a jewel box.

325
00:32:54.118 --> 00:32:57.790
And these are not eggs,
they are blue berries.


326
00:32:57.878 --> 00:33:00.230
The treasures of a male bowerbird.

327
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.200
And here is one of those
treasure-hoarding capitalists,


328
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.000
the flamed bowerbird.

329
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.319
He may not have elaborate plumes,

330
00:33:18.398 --> 00:33:21.868
but his body feathers
could scarcely be more brilliant.


331
00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.750
Those on his shoulders
have a gloss like spun glass.


332
00:33:35.398 --> 00:33:38.388
But this is about all he does
to display them.


333
00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.118
It's as if his ancestors
once had big plumes,


334
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.510
and although he hasn't inherited them,

335
00:33:43.598 --> 00:33:46.750
he still goes through the motions
of displaying them.


336
00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.230
Whether that is so or not
he now puts his faith in his jewels.


337
00:33:54.319 --> 00:33:57.388
And here's another
to add to that collection.


338
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.319
Now he's chewing up leaves into a paste.

339
00:34:05.398 --> 00:34:08.940
Perhaps he's trying to beautify
the bower walls.


340
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.790
The abundance of food in the forest

341
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.440
has had the same effect
on the bowerbird family


342
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.190
as it has on their cousins
the birds of paradise.


343
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.960
It's enabled the males
to become polygamists.


344
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:27.150
But whereas birds of paradise attract
their wives with plumes on their bodies,


345
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.000
these birds do it with jewels
and their bowers.


346
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:38.719
And like plumes, the bowers have been
elaborated to an extraordinary degree.


347
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.719
Like this one, for example.
This is a maypole bower.


348
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.239
The builder - a drab little bird.

349
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.909
But then, he relies even less
on his feathers


350
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.150
and much more on his skill
as an architect and builder.


351
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.349
And he's got something
to be really proud of.


352
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.040
He decorates
this impressive construction


353
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.400
with green lichen around the base.

354
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:29.119
And from the end of the twigs
of the tower, he hangs frass -


355
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.159
caterpillar droppings.

356
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.549
He does have the vestiges
of a yellow crest.


357
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.310
And he's a quite extraordinary songster.

358
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.639
And several of these males will build
their towers


359
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.759
quite close to one another in the forest.

360
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.270
The females tour them
make up their minds,


361
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.349
presumably about which is the finest,

362
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.349
and then mate with the architect
beside his creation.


363
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.270
They then go away and rear their young
entirely by themselves.


364
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.400
The father of this nestling
may never even see it.


365
00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.828
He spends nine months of the year close
to his award-winning building,


366
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:30.150
hoping, no doubt, that yet another
passing female will give him her vote.


367
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:44.960
And this is the work of the master builder
among bowerbirds.


368
00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.869
I'm in the Vogelkop on the far western tip
of New Guinea


369
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.310
and this is the bower
of the Vogelkop bowerbird.


370
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.259
And what an astonishment it is! Surely
one of the wonders of the natural world.


371
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.750
The bower
has been completely roofed over,


372
00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.750
thatched with these stems of orchids.

373
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.190
It's been built
around the base of a sapling,


374
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.440
it has a stark
pillar right in the middle,

375
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.590
and it's got two smaller pillars
on the side, to support it.


376
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:22.599
The whole of the treasury
is five or six yards across.


377
00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:27.000
And what treasures it contains!
Or what a variety of treasures it contains!


378
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:32.400
On the far side, there are the black stems
of tree ferns.


379
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.509
Here is the lawn
neatly planted with moss, and on it,


380
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:42.279
the shiny wing covers of beetles.

381
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.469
There are orange fruit, there are these
glowing orange dead leaves,


382
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:51.719
These are the acorns of the tropical oaks
which are common around here.


383
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:55.880
Behind me, there are black fruits.

384
00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.429
All of which has been brought specially
by the bird.


385
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.909
Bowerbirds are so dedicated
to their work


386
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.909
that even if you sit out in the open
beside the bower


387
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.150
they will often continue to work,
provided you sit absolutely still.


388
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.199
This Vogelkop bowerbird
is the plainest of his family,


389
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.320
with no sign whatever of a crest.

390
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.230
But the more spectacular the display
in your bower,


391
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.590
presumably the less need you have to
impress your mate with bright feathers.


392
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.560
And it's difficult to imagine

393
00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:47.078
a more impressive collection
of treasures than this.


394
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.659
But they do have to be properly arranged

395
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.880
to show them off really well.

396
00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.389
Flowers, whenever they appear
in the forest


397
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.790
have an obvious appeal to a bird who
has a passion for interior decoration.


398
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:49.119
From one point of view, these
adornments are better than feathers.


399
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:54.328
Individual birds of paradise cannot
choose their plumes' shape and colour.


400
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.070
They have to display with what their
genes have given them.


401
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.730
Bowerbirds, however, can choose.

402
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:05.828
If a male decides that he stands a better
chance of seducing a female with pink,


403
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.110
rather than blue
then he can decorate his bower that way.


404
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.440
So it's the tastes and fancies
of the females, single mothers,


405
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.989
who have no need of the help of the male
in bringing up their families,


406
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.920
that has led
to these extravagant exhibitions.


407
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.670
Whether or not the bowerbirds are
closely related to the birds of paradise,


408
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:44.000
both families have reacted in remarkably
similar ways to the asset they share -


409
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.840
the huge richness of this forest.

410
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.110
This really is a paradise for birds.

411
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:54.239
And the variety of bowers it has allowed
one family to build


412
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.070
is more than matched by the variety
of plumes evolved by the other.


413
00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.320
One group of female birds of paradise,
for example,


414
00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.509
fancied glossy throats,
and this is the result.


415
00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.719
The splendid astrapia.

416
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.960
Tails clearly didn't impress them
to anything like the same degree.


417
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.549
But the splendid astrapia has
a close cousin, Shaw Mayer's astrapia,


418
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.110
and those females had different tastes.

419
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.840
They were hot for tails.

420
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.750
There's no wonder that the result of their
selections over many generations


421
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.989
is also called
the ribbon-tailed bird of paradise.


422
00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.279
The female has to sit on a nest
and a long tail would get in the way,


423
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.630
but because of her
and her forebears' decisions


424
00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.759
about what makes a male attractive

425
00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.070
he now has the longest tail in proportion
to his body of any bird in the world.


426
00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:13.320
The smallest member of the family -
the king bird of paradise.


427
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.949
He has yet another kind of tail -
two wire-like quills,


428
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.429
each tipped with a little green disc
like a coin.


429
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.790
Not so obviously impressive
as the ribbon-tail


430
00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.259
but wait till you see
what he does with them.


431
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.828
Wingspreads and an extraordinary,
scarcely birdlike, call


432
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.949
are just the beginning of things.

433
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.500
Just attention-grabbing ways

434
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:45.719
to let any female around know
that he's on his perch,


435
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:49.509
and about to display his prowess
as an acrobat and a juggler.


436
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:12.119
What could be more attention-grabbing
than that?


437
00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:33.230
But that's not all. When he's really
excited, he's got a final stunt -


438
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.270
the pendulum.

439
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.469
There it is.

440
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.110
Down in the lowlands

441
00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:52.639
in the swamps beside the rivers,
lives the 12-wired bird of paradise.


442
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:57.199
He comes to his display post
in the early dawn.


443
00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:02.750
This is the bird I used to think
had been drawn so inaccurately,


444
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.509
but the old illustration was right -

445
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:09.719
the wires, the quills,
are indeed bent back in a tangle.


446
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.639
The female doesn't have them.

447
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:33.320
But do bent-back quills
appeal to a female?


448
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.349
They're hardly beautiful.

449
00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.270
Courtship seems to be
some kind of game,


450
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.110
a variation of I'm The King Of The Castle,
perhaps.


451
00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:07.159
Only, with a very special prize.

452
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.020
He deliberately brushed her face
with his rear quills!


453
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.840
He's doing it again!

454
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:54.869
It seems that she prefers to be seduced,
not by visual thrills, but by tactile ones.


455
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:09.599
And after the quill flick, the beak poke.

456
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.480
It may be an
odd technique, but it works.

457
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.750
I've now left New Guinea,.
I'm 200 miles to the west


458
00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.150
on the island of Halmahera
one of the Malukus, the Spice Islands.


459
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:09.270
It was here that Wallace made perhaps
his most spectacular discovery of all -


460
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.310
a completely unknown bird of paradise.

461
00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.590
On that today carries his name -
Wallace's standardwing.


462
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.469
It was only observed once more

463
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.159
in the hundred years that followed
his discovery.


464
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:28.520
And until recently, some people feared
it might have disappeared altogether.


465
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.520
So it is one of the least-known
of all species.


466
00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:33.360
But we do know that the males

467
00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.509
like the greater bird,
which Wallace made so famous


468
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.560
display in groups, and at dawn.

469
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.759
They've gathered in one of these trees,

470
00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.989
and from the racket
I'd guess there are 30 or 40 of them.


471
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.279
(Many birds calling)

472
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.270
The standards -
those long isolated feathers -


473
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.230
project not from the tail, the flank
or the head


474
00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.710
but, would you believe,
the front-edge of the wings.


475
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.989
These are advertising flights -

476
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:07.799
whizzing vertically into the air to show
passing females what's going on.


477
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.150
There he goes again.

478
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.960
I've been watching this perch
since very first light,


479
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.349
and I must have seen
at least a dozen displays,


480
00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.549
but not one of them has ended
with a mating.


481
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.599
I think that's because this
is one of the junior perches,


482
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:09.759
the subsidiary ones.
The senior perch, where all the action is,


483
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.989
is over there in a much taller tree.

484
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:14.549
That's where males are winning mates.

485
00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:55.719
A female.

486
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.699
This male is certainly putting on
a great performance.


487
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.869
ls she, in fact, assessing and comparing
the displays?


488
00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.949
A copulation.
As ever, a matter of seconds.


489
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.679
Another! Same place.

490
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.549
There seems little, to my eye at least,

491
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:17.639
to choose between all
the several dozen males.


492
00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:21.199
And I don't see how a female
could make a proper choice.


493
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:25.320
Maybe it is the perch in these
great assemblies of competing males


494
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.029
that is the important thing.

495
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:31.440
As it also may be among
the greater bird of paradise.


496
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.150
If that is so,
then in these mass displays,

497
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:37.400
the males are not so much showing off
to the females


498
00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.150
as posturing aggressively
to one another.


499
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.920
Using their plumes to demonstrate
their strength and vigour,


500
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.349
as stags do with their antlers.

501
00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.980
That would enable them to establish
a ranking between them all,


502
00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:53.599
and the boy at the top of the rank
gets the number one perch.


503
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.909
One of the mysteries about birds
of paradise, as far as I'm concerned,


504
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.310
is why, when they have
such wonderful colours


505
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.230
do they do so much of their displays
in the semi-darkness before dawn?


506
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.429
It's only now that the sun is up

507
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.110
that I can really see the full beauty
of these wonderful plumes.


508
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.719
The displays are over.

509
00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:26.509
It's time to get smartened up again
after all that rough and tumble.


510
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.400
The white standards are looking
a bit bedraggled too,


511
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.389
and at last I can see exactly how
they're attached to the front of the wing.


512
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:39.989
ls there a more elegant cravat, in both
shape and colour, worn by any bird?


513
00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.040
I doubt it.

514
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.509
So, after weeks of work and travel

515
00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:57.759
with cameramen
Richard Kirby and Mike Potts,


516
00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.349
we had filmed the displays
of not just one species,


517
00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.710
but representatives of all
the major groups of birds of paradise.


518
00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:09.279
And I had achieved
the ambition of a lifetime.


519
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.500
Wallace's emotions
on discovering such marvels


520
00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:22.310
must surely be echoed
by all of us who follow him.


521
00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.310
This is what he wrote -

522
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:30.920
"I thought of the long ages of the past,
during which the successive generations


523
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.630
"of these things of beauties
have run their course


524
00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:40.400
"year by year being born and living and
dying amid these dark, gloomy woods,


525
00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.869
"with no intelligent eye to gaze
upon their loveliness,


526
00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:47.429
"to all appearances,
such a wanton waste of beauty.


527
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.230
"lt seems sad that, on the one hand

528
00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:56.549
"such exquisite creatures should live out
their lives and exhibit their charms


529
00:53:56.650 --> 00:54:00.679
"only in these wild,
inhospitable regions.


530
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.040
"This consideration must surely tell us

531
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:07.279
"that all living things
were not made for man.


532
00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.469
"Many of them have no relation to him

533
00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:14.560
"Their happiness and enjoyments,
their loves and hates


534
00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:16.799
"their struggles for existence,

535
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.670
"their vigorous life and early death
would seem to be immediately related


536
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:26.549
"to their own wellbeing
and perpetuation alone."


537
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:30.560
Indeed so.
