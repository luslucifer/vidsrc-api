'不'
'No!'


10
00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:25.374
小心 他就在你身后
Watch out! He's right behind you!


11
00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:26.505
挡住视线了
Hey! Damn it front.


12
00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:27.846
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

'我来抓你了 Betsy'
'I'm coming to get you Betsy.'


14
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.591
快跑啊Betsy 快跑
Run Betsy! Run!


15
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:35.244
拜托 她根本不可能逃出吸血鬼的掌心
Come on! There is no way she can outrun a vampire.


16
00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.396
别听她的Betsy 你可以的
Don't listen to her Betsy, you can do it.


17
00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:37.967
不要放弃
Don't give up.


18
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.261

'没人能帮你了Betsy'
'No one can help you now Betsy.'


23
00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:51.640
无聊
Boring.


24
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.601
有点耐心
Patience.


25
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.934
好看的恐怖片都是慢慢推进的
All great horror film starts slowly.


26
00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:56.275
你看 他们设计
You see,they design...


27
00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.868
'求你了 让我进去'
'Please, let me in!'


28
00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:11.480
想办法 Betsy 快想办法
Tactics, Betsy, tactics.


29
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.532
找个能防卫自己的工具
Look for something to defend yourself with.


30
00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:15.254
总算
There we go.


31
00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:17.146
技术上来说那个一点用都没有
Oh, technically that would be useless.


32
00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:21.700
所有人都知道用木棍直插心脏是杀死吸血鬼的唯一方式
Everybody knows a wooden stake through the heart is the only way to kill a vampire.


33
00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:23.762
啊
Ahhh!


34
00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:27.846
哈哈 一只小猫 经典的障眼法
Haha, only a kitty cat, classic misdirection.


35
00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:29.008
一只猫
A cat?!


36
00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:31.400
拜托 这一点都不吓人
Come on guys, this isn't scary.


37
00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:41.480
救命 把我救出去
Help! Get me out of here!


38
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.192
Jessie 我们得把她救出来
Jessie, we have to get her out.


39
00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:47.516
Jessie Jessie 能听见吗
Jessie, Jessie, can you hear me?


40
00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:55.164
大家 数到三
Ok, everyone, on three.


41
00:01:55.384 --> 00:01:56.655
一 二 三
One, two, three!


42
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.421
Jessie Jessie
Jessie? Jessie!


43
00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:04.443
Jessie怎么了
What's the matter with Jessie?


44
00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:06.505
她被遗弃在一只盒子里好几年
She was abandoned in a box for years.


45
00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:09.468
我没法 我没法逃出去
I couldn't...I couldn't find a way out.


46
00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:11.560
妈妈 我能带上我的玩具吗
Mum, can I bring my toys?


47
00:02:26.695 --> 00:02:30.759
路边的汽车旅馆是恐怖片中最常见的场景之一
The roadside motel is one of the most common road cons for a horror film.


48
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.286
偏僻 无人 普通 给观众营造一种毫不可疑的舒心环境
Remote, isolated, ordinary, a comforting environment to a latest suspicion of audience.


49
00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:40.829
我猜她马上就要向旅馆老板借电话
I expect they'll be asking the inn keeper to use the telephone any minute now.


50
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.461
'我能借电话用一下吗'
'Would it be ok if I use your phone?'


51
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:43.993
'我们的轮胎漏气了'
'Our car is a flat.'


52
00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:45.744
时间恰好
Right on cue.


53
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:47.756
没事的Jessie 你很安全
It's ok Jessie, you'll be safe now.


54
00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:49.888
很快我们就会重新上路了
We'll be back on the road before you know it.


55
00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.270
有什么最新消息 Trixie
What's the latest, Trixie?


56
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.933
她还在和拖车公司通话
She's still on the phone with the tolltruck company.


57
00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:56.405
'早上六点 这是你最早能到这的时间吗'
'6 a.m.? That's the earliest you can get here?'


58
00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:57.366
六点

59
00:02:57.696 --> 00:02:59.308
意味着我们要在这里待一晚上吗
You mean we have to stay here all night?


60
00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:00.469
砰 砰 砰
Bom bom bom!


61
00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.523
我不在乎我们在哪 只要我不独自困在那个盒子里
I don't care where we are, as long as I'm not stuck alone in that box.


62
00:03:04.753 --> 00:03:06.825
请在旅客本上签字 
You think you could just sign here on the guest book?


63
00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:09.448
我去帮你刷卡
and I'll leave to see the major credit card for the incidentals.


64
00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:12.861
让我们看看 你住七号房间吧
Ok, let's see here. I'm gonna put you in room 7.


65
00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:15.294
我们这里有个说法
You know we have a little saying around here.


66
00:03:15.504 --> 00:03:19.228
在好梦旅馆 好梦伴随你
At the Sleep-Well Motel, you're gonna sleep well.


67
00:03:28.577 --> 00:03:30.159
看起来她们睡着了
Well, it looks like they are asleep.


68
00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.520
终于
Finally!


69
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.902
Potato Head 你要去哪
Potato Head, where are you going?


70
00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:36.485
我们在旅馆 我只是想看看这里的便利设施
We're at a motel, I just wanna check out the amenities.


71
00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:38.457
就是免费的东西啦
You know, the free stuff.


72
00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:42.381
小肥皂 浴帽 洗发露 护发素
Little soaps, shower caps, shampoo, conditioner.


73
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.423
我是你的话就不会出去
Oh, I wouldn't go out there if I were you.


74
00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:46.215
第一个离开的总是遇到麻烦
The first leave usually gets it.


75
00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:48.317
Potato Head 不要离开行李箱
Oh, Potato Head, don't leave the bag.


76
00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:51.150
汽车旅馆是玩具最容易走丢的地方
A motel is one of the easiest places for a toy to get lost.


77
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.701
别乱担心了
Shut your worry hole.


78
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.023
没人会走丢的
Nobody's gonna get lost.


79
00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:56.865
况且 我答应Emma要给她带点好东西回去
Besides, I promised Emma that I bring her back something nice.


80
00:03:57.486 --> 00:03:59.028
等等 你们又要去哪
Wait, where are you guys going?


81
00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:01.070
我们只是去看看免费的东西
We're just gonna check out the free stuff.


82
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.313
如果Potato Head真的遇到麻烦 我可不想错过好戏
And if something does happen to the Potato, I wouldn't want to miss it.


83
00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:06.996
拜托 伙计们 待在行李箱里好吗
Oh come on guys! Let's all just stay in the bag.


84
00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.989
Buzz 我去找那些家伙 你找Potato Head
Oh Buzz, I'll grab those guys, you get Potato head.


85
00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:10.559
好的
Got it.


86
00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:11.991
不 等等 不要走
No wait! Don't go!


87
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:13.652
不要担心Jessie 马上回来
Don't worry Jessie, I'll be right back!


88
00:04:13.762 --> 00:04:14.643
Buzz
Buzz!


89
00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:26.095
伙计们 你们在哪
Guys guys! Where are you?


90
00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:28.397
Jessie 怎么了 你还好吗
Jessie, what's wrong? Are you ok?


91
00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:30.009
Buzz 大伙呢
Buzz, where is everybody?


92
00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:31.560
不要担心 我们都在这里
Not to worry, we're all right here.


93
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.163
看 Woody  Pricklepants Trixie Rex
See, there's Woody, Pricklepants, Trixie, Rex,


94
00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:35.904
等等 Potato Head在哪
Wait, where is Potato head?


95
00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:38.177
好戏开始
And so it begins.


96
00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:40.849
Pricklepants 不要帮倒忙
Pricklepants, you're not helping.


97
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.033
我只是想说这种恐怖片中
I'm just saying it's quite common in these types of movies


98
00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:46.936
某个毫无疑心的角色走着走着消失了很正常
for one unsuspecting character to wander off and vanish.


99
00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:48.938
好吧 他不可能凭空消失
Well, he couldn't have just disappeared.


100
00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:50.199
也许这地方闹鬼
Maybe this place is haunted.


101
00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:51.180
什么 闹鬼
What? It's haunted?


102
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.653
当然不是 大家都知道世界上没有鬼
Of course not. Everybody knows ghosts aren't real.


103
00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:56.875
实际上 根据我的互联网研究
Actually, according to my internet research...


104
00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:57.766
不可能
Highly unlikely.


105
00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:00.069
一定有一个合理的解释
There has to be a rational explanation.


106
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.610
我们分成两人一组
We need break into groups of two.


107
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:03.292
看好你的搭档
Everyone keep an eye on your partner.


108
00:05:03.602 --> 00:05:05.384
任何异常 尖叫一声
Anything goes wrong, give a yell.


109
00:05:05.494 --> 00:05:06.195
啊
Ahhh!


110
00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:08.867
我踩到什么东西了
Ew, I stepped in something.


111
00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:09.658
恶心
Ew!


112
00:05:09.728 --> 00:05:10.299
等一下
Wait a minute.


113
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:13.452
嗯
Hmm...


114
00:05:14.923 --> 00:05:15.354
这是什么
What is it?


115
00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:16.795
恶心
Disgusting.


116
00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:21.420
如果这里是电影 一定是在怪兽变形的时候掉下的
Were...Were this a movie, I'd say it was sliding from the creature's metamorphosis.


117
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:23.692
好吧 不管是什么
Yeah, well, whatever it is,


118
00:05:23.842 --> 00:05:25.244
Potato Head踩到了
Potato Head managed to step in it,


119
00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:27.296
留下了一串脚印
leaving behind a trailer of footprints,


120
00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:30.329
我们跟着脚印 应该就能找到他
If we follow it, should lead us right to it.


121
00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:31.150
伙计们
Hey guys!


122
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.331
等等 Trixie 不要
No wait! Trixie! Don't!


123
00:05:33.302 --> 00:05:34.143
Trixie
Trixie!


124
00:05:37.326 --> 00:05:37.856
Trixie
Trixie?


125
00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:38.837
Potato Head
Potato Head?


126
00:05:39.178 --> 00:05:41.240
这就是黑暗之塔
And this would be the turrical.


127
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.781
每部电影都有
Every movie has one, you know.


128
00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:46.335
一旦英雄进去 再也没有退路
Once the hero enter, there's no turning back.


129
00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:47.496
Rex 赶快
Rex, hurry up!


130
00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:48.397
来了
Coming!


131
00:05:48.777 --> 00:05:50.479
现在我们只需找到一条下去的路
Now we just need to find a way down.


132
00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:51.880
啊
Ahhh!


133
00:05:53.212 --> 00:05:54.403
还真下来了
Well, that did the job.


134
00:05:55.264 --> 00:05:55.724
抱歉
Sorry.


135
00:05:55.824 --> 00:05:56.445
大家都还好吗
Is everyone ok?


136
00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:57.296
啊
Ahh!


137
00:05:57.476 --> 00:05:57.756
那里
That way.


138
00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.268
所有人 紧靠一起
Alright everybody, stay close.


139
00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:18.257
接下来会怎样
So, what happens now?


140
00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:23.032
大家会被拆散 然后一个接一个被抓
Well, this would be the part where the characters get separated and then picked off one by one.


141
00:06:23.212 --> 00:06:24.593
然后呢
Then what happens next?


142
00:06:24.813 --> 00:06:25.324
啊
Ahhh!


143
00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:27.226
Pricklepants在哪
Where is Pricklepants?


144
00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.358
他刚刚还站在这里
He was standing right here just a moment ago.


145
00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:30.549
我们要怎么办
What are we gonna do now?


146
00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.301
他是唯一知道接下来会发生什么的人
He was the only one who knew what the heck is going on!


147
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:33.973
啊啊啊啊
Ahhhhhh!


148
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.481
等等 等等 听
Wait, wait, listen.


149
00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:44.213
我觉得我们甩掉它了
I think we lost it.


150
00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:46.395
在那
It's over there!


151
00:06:46.465 --> 00:06:46.735
什么
What?


152
00:06:48.197 --> 00:06:48.797
这里
Over here.


153
00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:53.252
我看到了 它正在盯着我们看
I think I can see it, it's staring right at us.


154
00:06:56.635 --> 00:06:57.967
是Potato Head的手臂
It's Potato Head's arm.


155
00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:00.249
等一下 他貌似想告诉我们什么
Wait a minute, it looks like it's trying to tell us something.


156
00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.330
到底是什么
What is it, little buddy?


157
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.342
他好像在用某种手势
I think he's using some kind of hand signals.


158
00:07:03.552 --> 00:07:04.593
是数字一
It's the number one.


159
00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:05.534
不 一个单词
No, one letter.


160
00:07:06.045 --> 00:07:07.066
一个音节
One syllable?


161
00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:08.367
很久以前
Uh, once upon a time.


162
00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:09.428
一加一等于一
Uh, one plus one is one.


163
00:07:10.489 --> 00:07:12.711
也许他是指上面
I think maybe it's pointing up?


164
00:07:13.862 --> 00:07:14.513
- 上面  - 对
- Up! - Yeah!


165
00:07:14.563 --> 00:07:15.404
当然
Of course!


166
00:07:28.267 --> 00:07:29.328
把手递给我
Pass me the hand, will you?


167
00:07:44.773 --> 00:07:45.544
接下来怎么办
What now?


168
00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:48.427
出门 右拐
Out the door and to the right?


169
00:07:48.537 --> 00:07:49.458
什么 你确定吗
What? Are you sure?


170
00:07:49.578 --> 00:07:51.310
我觉得指的是左边
The hand looks like it's pointing left to me.


171
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.161
啊
Huh?


172
00:07:52.231 --> 00:07:52.791
这边
Over here.


173
00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:53.472
什么
What?


174
00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:54.833
看这边
Look over here.


175
00:07:54.944 --> 00:07:56.635
有人吗 有人吗
Hello? Hello?


176
00:07:57.906 --> 00:07:59.178
伙计们 等一下
Hey, guys. Wait up!


177
00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:01.070
Woody Buzz
Woody! Buzz!


178
00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:05.624
嘘 安静士兵 你会把他们引过来的
Shhh! Quite soldier, you'll lead them right to us.


179
00:08:05.824 --> 00:08:07.766
玩具在这里太危险
This place isn't safe for toys.


180
00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:10.319
Combat Carl要把手移开了
Combat Carl's gonna take his hand away now.


181
00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:12.191
你叫 我们都完蛋
You yell, we're done for.


182
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:12.901
明白吗
Got it?


183
00:08:14.913 --> 00:08:16.845
Combat Carl经历过好多
Combat Carl's seen things,


184
00:08:17.086 --> 00:08:18.267
可怕的事情
horrible things.


185
00:08:18.577 --> 00:08:21.370
Combat Carl学会了永不停止
Combat Carl's learned, you gotta keep moving,


186
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.042
否则他们会找到你
or else they'll find you.


187
00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:25.434
你是Combat Carl吗
Are you Combat Carl?


188
00:08:25.624 --> 00:08:28.097
让Combat Carl坚持到现在的唯一原因
The only thing that's kept Combat Carl going is


189
00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:31.470
他想也许他还能再见一次他的主人Billy
the thought he might see his owner Billy just one more time.


190
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:34.343
你最好现在就回去
You better turn back now,


191
00:08:34.573 --> 00:08:36.875
否则你再也见不到你的主人
or you'll never see your owner again.


192
00:08:36.976 --> 00:08:38.577
但我得找到我的朋友
But I need to find my friends.


193
00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:41.060
这就是你去找你朋友的下场
This is what happens when you try to find your friends.


194
00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:43.452
嘘 听到了吗
Shhh. Did you hear that?


195
00:08:53.152 --> 00:08:54.543
他找到我们了 我们被困住了
He found us, we are trapped.


196
00:08:54.693 --> 00:08:56.275
不 Combat Carl从不放弃
No, Combat Carl never gives up,


197
00:08:56.355 --> 00:08:57.616
Combat Carl总能想到办法
Combat Carl finds a way.


198
00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:58.877
我们得走了 准备好了吗
We gotta move. You ready?


199
00:08:58.948 --> 00:08:59.718
什么 不
What? No!


200
00:08:59.818 --> 00:09:00.499
数到三
We're going on three.

One, two, three.


202
00:09:02.932 --> 00:09:03.612
抓紧我
Grab my arm.


203
00:09:05.304 --> 00:09:07.326
Carl 等等 Carl
Carl, wait, Carl!


204
00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:12.311
不要管Combat Carl 快逃
Forget about Combat Carl, just go!


205
00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:43.772
啊
Ahhhh!


206
00:09:56.925 --> 00:09:57.716

谢谢 很有趣
Thank you, well, it's been fun.


210
00:10:17.306 --> 00:10:20.269
麻烦来了

211
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:29.078
看起来挺旧的 应该值点钱
Hmm, looks old, probably worth something.


212
00:10:29.318 --> 00:10:31.520
干得好 Mr. Jones
Excellent find, Mr. Jones.


213

Combat Carl三分之一大小模型 小Combat Carl
to his one third skill counterpart, Combat Carl Junior.

Ma'am sorry to break up the party, but we're on a tight schedule.

有看到那个人或者那只蜥蜴吗

他已经离开了19秒

经理Ron随时都可能回来

好 就让我再试一试

第三次一定能成功

稳住 别紧张
Steady. Take it easy now.

哦不
Oh-no!

Jessie 没人会被装进盒子里

我们会一起离开的
We're leaving together.


253
00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:17.886
您有一笔销售

不过看起来像是一个 牛仔
But it looks like a cowboy.


257

我也不知道
I have no foggist idea.


265
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.284
一开始就是个经典的恐怖电影 结果变成了悲剧
What starts out is a classic horror film has turned into something more of a tragedy.


266
00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:08.577
我不敢相信 我们将再也见不到Bonnie了

Yeah, you got a gas for the flat-tire that needs fixing.


281
00:13:45.804 --> 00:13:47.696
是的 我带你去
Absolutely. Come on, I'll show you the way.


282
00:13:49.498 --> 00:13:50.769
好了 他走了
OK, he's gone!


283
00:13:54.843 --> 00:13:56.925
没用的 我不够高
It's no use. I'm not tall enough.


284
00:13:57.666 --> 00:13:58.607
我去找Woody
I'll go get Woody.


285
00:13:58.767 --> 00:14:00.859
我们一起就可以够得着把手了
Together we will be able to reach the handle.


286
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:01.730
好计划 Jessie
Good plan, Jessie.


287
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.952
有人到门口了
Ahh! Someone's at the door.


288
00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:07.236
放在那里 柜台上的都送走
Stack there, and the ones on the counter all go too.


289
00:14:07.326 --> 00:14:07.836
好的
OKAY.


290
00:14:08.687 --> 00:14:10.609
看来我得跑两趟了
Looks I'm gonna have to take two trips.


291
00:14:13.162 --> 00:14:14.213
Woody
Ah Woody!


292
00:14:14.703 --> 00:14:15.924
好吧 我们需要B计划
Alright, we need a plan B.


293
00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:17.206
大家都想想
Put on your thinking caps, people.


294
00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:18.027
我想到了
I got it.


295
00:14:18.217 --> 00:14:19.638
她可以闯进送货车里
She can make a break through the delivery truck.


296
00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:20.960
这可行不通
It's what daylight.


297
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.082
况且 她也赶不上啊
Besides, she will never make it in time.


298
00:14:23.122 --> 00:14:24.193
我该怎么办
What do I do?


299
00:14:24.283 --> 00:14:26.315
现在我们都将会被关进盒子里
Now, we're all gonna end up in a box.


300
00:14:26.475 --> 00:14:27.256
等等 这就对了
Wait, that's it.


301
00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:28.427
Jessie 再说一遍
Jessie say that again.


302
00:14:28.537 --> 00:14:29.378
说什么
Say what?


303
00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:31.350
说我们最终都会被关进盒子里
That we're all gonna end up in boxes?


304
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.921
不是我们 是你
Not us, you.


305
00:14:33.192 --> 00:14:34.323
你要进到盒子里
You're gonna get in the box.


306
00:14:34.443 --> 00:14:34.964
什么
What?


307
00:14:35.064 --> 00:14:39.238
几分钟后 那个运货小姐就回来拿剩下的几个盒子
Listen, in a few minutes, the delivery lady is gonna come back through that door and take the other boxes.


308
00:14:39.348 --> 00:14:40.719
你就混在其中
And you are gonna be in one of them.


309
00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:42.331
这是你救Woody唯一的办法
It's the only way to free Woody.


310
00:14:42.411 --> 00:14:44.673
不行 我不行 我办不到
No, no way. I can't. I can't do that.


311
00:14:44.723 --> 00:14:46.785
我不能进到盒子里 我不能
I can't get in a box. I can't!


312
00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:47.977
一定有其他的办法
There's gotta be another way.


313
00:14:48.037 --> 00:14:48.938
这是唯一的办法
This is the way.


314
00:14:49.158 --> 00:14:50.529
你得振作起来 战士
You better snap out of it, soilder.


315
00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:53.212
我们现在时间紧迫 你是我们唯一的希望
We're running out of time. And you are the only chance we've got.


316
00:14:53.322 --> 00:14:55.044
不 我不行的
No! I can't.


317
00:14:55.534 --> 00:14:58.127
Jessie 听我说 想想你的特训
Jessie, Listen to me. Remember your training.


318
00:14:58.317 --> 00:14:59.928
但是我没特训过
But I don't have any training.


319
00:15:00.109 --> 00:15:01.080
啥 那算了
What, forget about that!


320
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.642
当Combat Carl遭遇危机  他对自己说
When Combat Carl get stuck in a jam, he says to himself:


321
00:15:03.732 --> 00:15:05.424
Combat Carl永不放弃
Combat Carl never gives up!


322
00:15:05.514 --> 00:15:07.206
Combat Carl能想到办法
Combat Carl finds a way!


323
00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:08.107
现在跟我说
Now say it!


324
00:15:08.477 --> 00:15:09.868
Combat Carl永不放弃
Combat Carl never gives up!


325
00:15:09.918 --> 00:15:11.050
你不是Combat Carl
You're not Combat Carl!


326
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.591
Jessie永不放弃
Jessie never gives up!


327
00:15:12.701 --> 00:15:13.522
Jessie能想到办法
Jessie finds a way!


328
00:15:13.582 --> 00:15:14.413
我听不见
I can't hear you.


329
00:15:14.493 --> 00:15:15.995
Jessie永不放弃
Jessie never gives up!


330
00:15:16.135 --> 00:15:17.376
Jessie能想到办法
Jessie finds a way!


331
00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:18.487
耶
Yeah!


332
00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:19.308
还有一件事
One more thing!


333
00:15:19.458 --> 00:15:20.169
小声点
Keep it down.


334
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:22.731
好吧
I'll try.


335
00:15:37.146 --> 00:15:38.237
醒醒 你自由了
Wake up, you're free.


336
00:15:42.121 --> 00:15:44.153
谁敢召唤Transtron
Who dares summon Transtron?


337
00:15:44.253 --> 00:15:45.714
我要用这个盒子
I need to use this box.


338
00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:47.426
Transtron自由了
Transtron free?


339
00:15:47.496 --> 00:15:49.168
是 过来 帮我个忙
Yes, right here, give me your hand.


340
00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:52.861
我怎么报答你呢
Er...How can I ever repay you?


341
00:15:54.873 --> 00:15:55.684
把我封起来
Seal me in.


342
00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:57.266
额
Er.


343
00:15:58.267 --> 00:15:58.767
好
OK.


344
00:15:59.698 --> 00:16:00.379
到你了
You're up.


345
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:11.140
Ok
Ok.


346
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:14.383
等等 停手 别封住
Wait, wait, don't tape it.


347
00:16:14.443 --> 00:16:15.854
这样我就出不来了
I won't be able to get out.


348
00:16:15.914 --> 00:16:19.118
关上盒子 把那个盒子放在我上面 堆起来就好
Just close the flaps and put that box on the top of it, it'll give it shut.


349
00:16:19.238 --> 00:16:20.719
你确定
Are you sure about this?


350
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.571
不 不确定
No. Not really.


351
00:16:26.635 --> 00:16:29.788
我们星球的神灵一定会让你永垂不朽的
My globe tron's ghost you shall be remembered,


352
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:30.399
好吧
All right.


353
00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:31.870
变身 分离
Put the tron. Seperate.


354
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.771
还有其他人
Anything else?


355
00:16:35.114 --> 00:16:36.745
计划貌似有效
Well, the plan seems to be working.


356
00:16:36.905 --> 00:16:38.317
到目前为止都很好
So far so good.


357
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.582
又忘记封盒子了
Oh forgot to tape again.


358
00:16:45.424 --> 00:16:46.485
什么 不 不
What! No no.


359
00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.166
她被封住了
She got sealed in.


360
00:16:57.236 --> 00:16:59.218
没戏了 我们永远都出不去了
That's it. We're never gonna get out of here.

Patience. Cinematics strategetic always duck.

天啊 她在做什么

392
00:18:21.941 --> 00:18:23.042
她直冲向门帘了
She's heading straight for the curtain.


393
00:18:23.092 --> 00:18:24.223
这不是计划的一部分啊

只是个误会而已
It's just a mistake.


411

知道吗 我应该报警
You know I really should call the police.

417
00:19:58.417 --> 00:20:01.810
结局了 我们又回到了起点
The epilog! We're back to the location where it all began.


418
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.172
从没想过我会想念后车厢
