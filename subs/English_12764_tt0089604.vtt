00:13:07.722 --> 00:13:09.519
<b>I say that all Braddock
has to do is confess...</b>


157
00:13:09.558 --> 00:13:12.584
<b>to some garbage war crime,
and Yin will send us home.</b>


158
00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:13.753
<b>Who's gonna care?</b>

159
00:13:15.096 --> 00:13:16.791
<b>The war has been over for...</b>

160
00:13:20.001 --> 00:13:21.400
<b>for God knows how long.</b>

161
00:13:21.436 --> 00:13:22.801
<b>We don't know that for sure.</b>

162
00:13:22.837 --> 00:13:25.397
<b>There is no war.</b>

163
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.738
<b>And nobody gives
a damn about us.</b>


164
00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:29.937
<b>Oh, yeah?</b>

165
00:13:29.978 --> 00:13:31.843
<b>Well, I hear they're
coming to get us.</b>


166
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.405
<b>And if I were you,
I'd rather die here...</b>


167
00:13:34.449 --> 00:13:35.814
<b>than have to explain
to my kid...</b>


168
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.511
<b>that I was a gutless traitor.</b>

169
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.917
<b>At least I've seen my kid.</b>

170
00:13:42.524 --> 00:13:43.513
<b>Let him go.</b>

171
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.463
<b>Back off, Nester.</b>

172
00:13:57.305 --> 00:13:59.239
<b>Die if you want to, all of you.</b>

173
00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:09.283
<b>Who tell you someone coming?</b>

174
00:14:09.317 --> 00:14:10.944
<b>No one.</b>

175
00:14:10.986 --> 00:14:12.817
<b>I made it up to piss him off.</b>

176
00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:18.583
<b>Why'd those guys have to run?</b>

177
00:14:18.627 --> 00:14:20.094
<b>God, I got to get some sleep!</b>

178
00:14:23.164 --> 00:14:25.689
<b>But whenever I close my eyes,
I see my wife Gina.</b>


179
00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:32.669
<b>Yeah. My Diane's
gonna be mad at me.</b>


180
00:14:34.876 --> 00:14:36.844
<b>I wanted the four kids
more than she did.</b>


181
00:14:38.647 --> 00:14:39.875
<b>We made a deal.</b>

182
00:14:42.017 --> 00:14:44.508
<b>She'd work, and I'd retire
and bring them up.</b>


183
00:14:47.989 --> 00:14:50.753
<b>I fooled the hell out of her.</b>

184
00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:52.657
<b>I haven't even seen my kid!</b>

185
00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:01.665
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

186
00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:03.637
<b>I try to block it out,
but I can't.</b>


187
00:15:03.672 --> 00:15:06.402
<b>No one can.</b>

188
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:07.908
<b>You do. Nothing bothers you.</b>

189
00:15:09.477 --> 00:15:10.637
<b>I'm just...</b>

190
00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:14.912
<b>I'm just not tough like you.</b>

191
00:16:25.186 --> 00:16:26.175
<b>Lao.</b>

192
00:16:33.762 --> 00:16:36.560
<b>Sergeant Lawrence Opelka...</b>

193
00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:38.759
<b>you have been tried
and found guilty...</b>


194
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.327
<b>of war crimes against
the people of Vietnam...</b>


195
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.565
<b>and have been sentenced
to death.</b>


196
00:17:29.984 --> 00:17:31.144
<b>Please!</b>

197
00:17:37.425 --> 00:17:38.414
<b>Nester.</b>

198
00:17:41.296 --> 00:17:42.593
<b>What does he want from him?</b>

199
00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:54.970
<b>Chou, get over here!</b>

200
00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:57.068
<b>Chou! You scum!</b>

201
00:17:57.111 --> 00:17:59.102
<b>Come down here, Chou!</b>

202
00:17:59.147 --> 00:18:00.273
<b>Mazilli!</b>

203
00:18:00.315 --> 00:18:03.409
<b>Come here, Chou!
You're nothing! Chou! Chou!</b>


204
00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:06.147
<b>You lose.</b>

205
00:18:06.187 --> 00:18:07.449
<b>You're scum, Chou!</b>

206
00:18:07.488 --> 00:18:09.080
<b>Get down here
and shut that door!</b>


207
00:18:09.123 --> 00:18:10.249
<b>Mazilli!</b>

208
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:12.452
<b>Get down here, Chou!
I said, get down here!</b>


209
00:18:12.493 --> 00:18:13.482
<b>Mazilli!</b>

210
00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:17.765
<b>It's not doing anyone any good.
You know that.</b>


211
00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:20.267
<b>What the hell is going on?</b>

212
00:18:20.301 --> 00:18:21.996
<b>Why are they starting
this torture crap again?</b>


213
00:18:33.982 --> 00:18:36.212
<b>It's OK, kid. It's OK.</b>

214
00:18:55.703 --> 00:18:57.637
<b>Here. Brought you some things.</b>

215
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.138
<b>Did you get the quinine?</b>

216
00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:03.370
<b>No, I can't.
Yin has it locked up.</b>


217
00:19:03.411 --> 00:19:06.744
<b>But he told me to tell you
that if Braddock confesses...</b>


218
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:08.009
<b>he will give it to you.</b>

219
00:19:09.617 --> 00:19:10.948
<b>Yin can't be trusted.</b>

220
00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:16.386
<b>I've given him what he wanted,
and he's treated me well enough.</b>


221
00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:20.585
<b>He doesn't care about you.</b>

222
00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:22.994
<b>It's Braddock's confession
he's always wanted.</b>


223
00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:26.000
<b>Over the years,
it's driven him mad.</b>


224
00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:28.594
<b>Then why not
just give it to him?</b>


225
00:19:30.004 --> 00:19:34.805
<b>If Yin ever breaks Braddock,
we will all be killed.</b>


226
00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:41.013
<b>Colonel Braddock,
I have spoken to my superiors...</b>


227
00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:42.846
<b>and arranged for you
to be released...</b>


228
00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:49.556
<b>if you will simply let us film
your confession just once.</b>


229
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.048
<b>No public appearances,
no questions.</b>


230
00:19:53.094 --> 00:19:54.789
<b>We could do it right now.</b>

231
00:20:00.802 --> 00:20:02.099
<b>You know I can't do that.</b>

232
00:20:06.274 --> 00:20:10.802
<b>Some of my men feel
I am being too lenient with you.</b>


233
00:20:17.819 --> 00:20:18.911
<b>Colonel Braddock...</b>

234
00:20:20.254 --> 00:20:22.347
<b>I didn't want
to have to tell you this...</b>


235
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.950
<b>but maybe you should know.</b>

236
00:20:24.993 --> 00:20:28.793
<b>Your wife
is planning to remarry.</b>


237
00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:32.664
<b>She has you declared dead.</b>

238
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.300
<b>Your family needs you.</b>

239
00:20:41.642 --> 00:20:43.269
<b>Sign this statement...</b>

240
00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:47.247
<b>I will let you go home
before the wedding.</b>


241
00:20:49.984 --> 00:20:53.852
<b>Colonel Yin, if my wife
is getting remarried...</b>


242
00:20:53.888 --> 00:20:55.480
<b>I'm happy for her...</b>

243
00:20:55.523 --> 00:20:57.684
<b>because if she's gonna wait for
me to sign this confession...</b>


244
00:20:57.725 --> 00:20:59.784
<b>she's gonna be waiting
a long time.</b>


245
00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:10.568
<b>Get him out of here.</b>

246
00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:29.082
<b>Get down! Come on!</b>

247
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.625
<b>Hey! Come on!</b>

248
00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:40.600
<b>That humper Lao is the biggest
asshole this side of Nester.</b>


249
00:21:44.806 --> 00:21:47.036
<b>Leave him alone, Lao.
You hear me?!</b>


250
00:21:51.546 --> 00:21:55.676
<b>Braddock, since you're
in a fighting mood...</b>


251
00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:56.876
<b>I'll give you one.</b>

252
00:21:58.953 --> 00:22:01.854
<b>Nester, you will be
Braddock's opponent...</b>


253
00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:03.288
<b>and you will win.</b>

254
00:22:08.496 --> 00:22:09.724
<b>I can't do that, sir.</b>

255
00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:15.299
<b>Colonel Yin, our deal was that
I would never have to hurt...</b>


256
00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:16.735
<b>any of the other prisoners.</b>

257
00:22:18.272 --> 00:22:19.967
<b>Fine.</b>

258
00:22:20.007 --> 00:22:22.134
<b>Don't fight.</b>

259
00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:23.268
<b>But...</b>

260
00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:29.546
<b>I will put you back
in the Americans' cell.</b>


261
00:22:29.584 --> 00:22:34.078
<b>I'm not sure you would be as
popular there as you once were.</b>


262
00:22:57.478 --> 00:23:00.174
<b>Why don't you just take a few
punches and go down, Colonel?</b>


263
00:23:00.214 --> 00:23:01.943
<b>Itâ€™ll save us both
a lot of pain.</b>


264
00:23:01.983 --> 00:23:02.972
<b>Yeah.</b>

265
00:23:05.386 --> 00:23:06.717
<b>Put your hands up, Braddock.</b>

266
00:23:08.823 --> 00:23:10.552
<b>Colonel Yin is watching us.</b>

267
00:23:10.591 --> 00:23:11.751
<b>Put your hands up.</b>

268
00:23:11.792 --> 00:23:13.692
<b>Nester, he's using you.</b>

269
00:23:16.164 --> 00:23:17.324
<b>Come on.</b>

270
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:23.065
<b>Come on, sir! Get up!</b>

271
00:23:23.104 --> 00:23:26.505
<b>Protect yourself!</b>

272
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:28.133
<b>Damn you, Colonel. Fight me.</b>

273
00:23:29.377 --> 00:23:31.709
<b>Come on, Colonel.
Protect yourself.</b>


274
00:23:33.147 --> 00:23:34.136
<b>Braddock.</b>

275
00:23:35.716 --> 00:23:36.842
<b>Nester, Nester.</b>

276
00:23:36.884 --> 00:23:38.249
<b>Get up, Colonel! Get up!</b>

277
00:23:38.286 --> 00:23:39.583
<b>Come on.</b>

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.746
<b>Braddock!</b>

279
00:23:40.788 --> 00:23:44.349
<b>You bastard,
either stay down or fight!</b>


280
00:23:44.392 --> 00:23:47.020
<b>Come on, Colonel!
Hit him again! Yes!</b>


281
00:23:49.964 --> 00:23:52.194
<b>He's gonna kill you, Nester.</b>

282
00:23:52.233 --> 00:23:53.757
<b>I don't want to fight you,
Nester.</b>

<b>You got no choice now, Colonel.</b>

284
00:23:57.171 --> 00:23:59.469
<b>No more favors.</b>

285
00:23:59.507 --> 00:24:02.032
<b>Now I'm gonna hurt you!</b>

286
00:24:02.076 --> 00:24:03.976
<b>Come on, sir! Get up!</b>

287
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.308
<b>Come on! For all of us!
Get him!</b>


288
00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:06.643
<b>Come on, Colonel!</b>

289
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:09.844
<b>Come on, Nester,
don't be a fool, man!</b>


290
00:24:16.424 --> 00:24:17.823
<b>Get up, Colonel.
Come on, get up.</b>


291
00:24:20.394 --> 00:24:22.453

<b>Come on.</b>

294

<b>One more. Come on, in on him!</b>

295

<b>Come on, Braddock.</b>

298
00:24:34.875 --> 00:24:37.070
<b>Enough. Come on.
Finish this off.</b>


299
00:24:37.111 --> 00:24:38.100
<b>Give him one good shot.</b>

300
00:24:46.954 --> 00:24:47.943
<b>Come on!</b>

301
00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:55.589
<b>Finish him off, sir. Come on.</b>

<b>- Be careful.
- Watch yourself.</b>


303

<b>One shot!</b>

310
00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:14.542
<b>Come on, get up. Come on.
Come on, Colonel, get up!</b>


311
00:25:14.582 --> 00:25:17.073
<b>Now! You're beaten!</b>

312
00:25:17.118 --> 00:25:18.949
<b>Come on, soldier, get up.</b>

313
00:25:25.326 --> 00:25:26.554
<b>How's it feel, Nester?!</b>

314
00:25:30.698 --> 00:25:32.859
<b>Keep on him!
Get him, Colonel!</b>


315
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.924
<b>Yes!</b>

316
00:25:36.404 --> 00:25:37.928
<b>Sir, Colonel,
you're killing him!</b>


317
00:26:08.369 --> 00:26:10.098
<b>That's enough!</b>

318
00:26:10.137 --> 00:26:11.832
<b>Lao, that's enough!</b>

319
00:26:11.872 --> 00:26:12.964
<b>No!</b>

320
00:26:23.117 --> 00:26:24.379
<b>You see what happens...</b>

321
00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:28.514
<b>when one does not follow
my direction immediately.</b>


322
00:26:35.463 --> 00:26:37.488
<b>You lose.</b>

323
00:26:44.405 --> 00:26:45.394
<b>Colonel?</b>

324
00:26:48.976 --> 00:26:50.443
<b>What did Yin lay on you
this time?</b>


325
00:26:50.478 --> 00:26:53.106
<b>He said that my wife's
getting remarried...</b>


326
00:26:53.147 --> 00:26:54.614
<b>and I've been declared dead.</b>

327
00:26:54.648 --> 00:26:57.446
<b>He's bullshitting you.
You know that, don't you?</b>


328
00:27:01.689 --> 00:27:02.849
<b>Captain Ho.</b>

329
00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:06.418
<b>Anything on the quinine?</b>

330
00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.155
<b>I don't have malaria.</b>

331
00:27:11.432 --> 00:27:13.662
<b>Nothing.</b>

332
00:27:13.701 --> 00:27:15.134
<b>But I have some things for you.</b>

333
00:27:18.272 --> 00:27:19.796
<b>Beer?</b>

334
00:27:32.019 --> 00:27:33.850
<b>Why don't you go give
the guys a drink?</b>


335
00:27:33.888 --> 00:27:34.946
<b>Sure.</b>

336
00:27:40.761 --> 00:27:42.661
<b>Have I got a surprise for you.</b>

337
00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:47.299
<b>You see this baby, huh?
Look at that.</b>


338
00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:50.360
<b>Hey, Lieutenant, have a sip.</b>

339
00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:53.867
<b>This is what you wanted.</b>

340
00:27:58.579 --> 00:27:59.568
<b>Thanks, Captain.</b>

341
00:28:41.922 --> 00:28:44.482
<b>Colonel Yin,
I need to talk to you.</b>


342
00:28:48.496 --> 00:28:50.896
<b>I'm the officer in charge.</b>

343
00:28:50.931 --> 00:28:53.365
<b>If you have to punish somebody,
then punish me.</b>


344
00:29:04.445 --> 00:29:07.505
<b>Confess. Admit your mistake.</b>

345
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.139
<b>No.</b>

346
00:29:17.424 --> 00:29:18.584
<b>Very well.</b>

347
00:29:21.295 --> 00:29:22.455
<b>Dou Chou.</b>

348
00:29:28.168 --> 00:29:29.328
<b>No!</b>

349
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.540
<b>You're right.
You are responsible.</b>


350
00:29:47.821 --> 00:29:49.880
<b>Come on, Franklin.
Here. I'll help you.</b>


351
00:31:51.478 --> 00:31:54.072
<b>Let me get that one.
You get the small ones.</b>


352
00:31:54.114 --> 00:31:56.207
<b>Fine. I ain't doing
so hot anyway.</b>


353
00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:06.848
<b>What's that?</b>

354
00:32:08.195 --> 00:32:09.856
<b>It's a chopper...</b>

355
00:32:09.897 --> 00:32:11.023
<b>A Huey.</b>

356
00:32:11.065 --> 00:32:11.997
<b>It sounds American.</b>

357
00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:33.945
<b>Stop him!</b>

358
00:33:34.815 --> 00:33:36.043
<b>What the hell?</b>

359
00:33:48.462 --> 00:33:51.590
<b>I hope I didn't scare you guys.</b>

360
00:33:51.632 --> 00:33:53.395
<b>How do you like
my new helicopter?</b>


361
00:33:54.802 --> 00:33:56.201
<b>You are a day early.</b>

362
00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:59.797
<b>I had to borrow it.
The other was too small.</b>


363
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.434
<b>I've brought you an arsenal
that will discourage anyone...</b>


364
00:34:02.476 --> 00:34:04.467
<b>from cutting into
our opium business.</b>


365
00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:09.312
<b>Now all that can harm us are
your American friends.</b>


366
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:11.146
<b>Why are they still alive?</b>

367
00:34:11.185 --> 00:34:14.985
<b>Francois, I have
the situation under control.</b>


368
00:34:17.758 --> 00:34:19.589
<b>Thanks for our treat.</b>

369
00:34:19.626 --> 00:34:22.186
<b>You're a hot little devil.</b>

370
00:34:22.229 --> 00:34:25.255
<b>You know, this time
they're all virgins.</b>


371
00:34:27.534 --> 00:34:28.694
<b>Come on, girls.</b>

372
00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:34.837
<b>Colonel, I don't think
there is a search team.</b>


373
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.737
<b>There's nothing
we can do about it now.</b>


374
00:34:38.779 --> 00:34:41.304
<b>At least we know what they're
putting in that hut.</b>


375
00:34:41.348 --> 00:34:42.576
<b>Those boxes?</b>

376
00:34:42.616 --> 00:34:44.846
<b>They're full of weapons.</b>

377
00:34:44.885 --> 00:34:46.648
<b>That's our way out.</b>

378
00:34:47.988 --> 00:34:50.252
<b>When do you aim to kill
the Americans?</b>


379
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.053
<b>In my own time.</b>

380
00:34:52.092 --> 00:34:54.219
<b>You're risking
our entire operation...</b>


381
00:34:54.261 --> 00:34:55.751
<b>a very profitable operation.</b>

382
00:34:55.796 --> 00:34:57.889
<b>I'm thinking of
getting a new watch.</b>


383
00:34:57.931 --> 00:35:00.798
<b>Do you think you can purchase
one of those digital models?</b>


384
00:35:02.636 --> 00:35:05.628
<b>I told you to kill
the Americans, goddamn it!</b>


385
00:35:05.672 --> 00:35:08.607
<b>If the P.O.W. Search team hears
about it, we're finished!</b>


386
00:35:08.642 --> 00:35:10.735
<b>Don't let your stupid ego
ruin everything!</b>


387
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:20.884
<b>Francois, will you
come with me for a moment?</b>


388
00:35:26.426 --> 00:35:28.155
<b>Look, I didn't want to...</b>

389
00:35:29.763 --> 00:35:34.359
<b>You will never again speak to me
like that in front of my men.</b>


390
00:35:34.401 --> 00:35:36.198
<b>It sets a dangerous example.</b>

391
00:35:38.605 --> 00:35:40.095
<b>Do you understand me?</b>

392
00:35:42.776 --> 00:35:44.038
<b>Good.</b>

393
00:35:46.613 --> 00:35:52.882
<b>Do you have any new information
about the American search team?</b>


394
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.855
<b>No. It's still rumors...</b>

395
00:35:55.889 --> 00:35:59.757
<b>but there's been a guy
hanging around asking questions.</b>


396
00:36:04.064 --> 00:36:05.429
<b>I wonder if Opelka is dead.</b>

397
00:36:05.465 --> 00:36:08.491
<b>No. If he were...</b>

398
00:36:08.535 --> 00:36:11.197
<b>Colonel Yin would stick his body
right in front of our faces.</b>


399
00:36:15.208 --> 00:36:18.302
<b>So, my friend,
could I convince you...</b>


400
00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:20.905
<b>to spend the night
with us and the virgins?</b>


401
00:36:22.249 --> 00:36:24.217
<b>Sorry. I better not.</b>

402
00:36:24.251 --> 00:36:25.377
<b>Understand...</b>

403
00:36:25.419 --> 00:36:27.216
<b>I'm delivering
the opium personally...</b>


404
00:36:27.254 --> 00:36:29.484
<b>but I will be back
to pick up the girls.</b>


405
00:36:33.627 --> 00:36:34.924
<b>Don't forget my watch.</b>

406
00:37:03.957 --> 00:37:08.894
<b>Colonel Braddock, Francois
brought me something today...</b>


407
00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:11.124
<b>that I'm sure is of
great interest to you.</b>


408
00:37:13.367 --> 00:37:18.828
<b>It seems your ex-wife has
finally written you a letter.</b>


409
00:37:30.717 --> 00:37:34.244
<b>Unfortunately,
you must be punished...</b>


410
00:37:34.287 --> 00:37:38.348
<b>for the incident with
your late friend... Opelka.</b>


411
00:37:38.392 --> 00:37:39.381
<b>He's dead?</b>

412
00:38:06.086 --> 00:38:07.348
<b>Ho!</b>

413
00:38:29.943 --> 00:38:32.104
<b>Playboy, you want to play?</b>

414
00:40:08.942 --> 00:40:09.966
<b>You!</b>

415
00:40:11.845 --> 00:40:14.245
<b>I've been looking for you.</b>

416
00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:15.578
<b>About time you showed up.</b>

417
00:40:15.615 --> 00:40:16.843
<b>Your headquarters.</b>

418
00:40:16.883 --> 00:40:18.282
<b>You take me
to your headquarters.</b>


419
00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:32.389
<b>Name's Emerson... 
Clyde Emerson.</b>

420
00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:35.323
<b>No. You don't understand.</b>

421
00:40:35.368 --> 00:40:37.768
<b>Now, what is needed here is a
little courtesy and cooperation.</b>


422
00:40:37.804 --> 00:40:41.001
<b>I'm the point man for
a P.O.W. Search mission.</b>


423
00:40:41.041 --> 00:40:44.442
<b>The I.F.H. Got word of this
little operation some time ago.</b>


424
00:40:44.477 --> 00:40:46.672
<b>I must say, we've had
a devil of a time finding you.</b>


425
00:40:46.713 --> 00:40:47.839
<b>Who is "we"?</b>

426
00:40:47.881 --> 00:40:50.611
<b>Ah, yes. The International
Freedom House.</b>


427
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.483
<b>I'm not just running around the
jungle looking for publicity.</b>


428
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.283
<b>He lie.</b>

429
00:40:55.322 --> 00:40:57.051
<b>It's not a lie.</b>

430
00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.785
<b>I'm part of a major operation.</b>

431
00:40:58.825 --> 00:41:00.258
<b>There are nine other scouts
like me.</b>


432
00:41:00.293 --> 00:41:03.057
<b>We each have five square miles
to cover.</b>


433
00:41:03.096 --> 00:41:06.327
<b>And all of us call in
to Central Team regularly.</b>


434
00:41:06.366 --> 00:41:10.496
<b>Now, if you think that's a lie,
you are in a pack of trouble.</b>


435
00:41:10.537 --> 00:41:11.663
<b>Why don't you cooperate...</b>

436
00:41:11.705 --> 00:41:13.900
<b>and save yourself a lot
of needless bloodshed?</b>


437
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.066
<b>What the hell is going on?</b>

438
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:18.041
<b>Damned if I know.</b>

439
00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.908
<b>Do you really expect me
to believe you...</b>


440
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.383
<b>and turn over my whole camp?</b>

441
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.349
<b>Well, under
the circumstances, yes.</b>


442
00:41:28.388 --> 00:41:30.253
<b>I believe that's the only thing
that you can do.</b>


443
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.520
<b>I hid a homing device
out there in the jungle.</b>


444
00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:34.390
<b>My team knows
exactly where I am.</b>


445
00:41:34.427 --> 00:41:36.361
<b>Now, they'll be waiting
for my signal.</b>


446
00:41:36.396 --> 00:41:37.863
<b>Now, if I give it,
they'll come in slowly.</b>


447
00:41:37.897 --> 00:41:39.990
<b>If I don't, they'll come in
fast, and you'll all be dead.</b>


448
00:41:40.033 --> 00:41:41.500
<b>What signal?</b>

449
00:41:41.534 --> 00:41:42.899
<b>Stop playing the fool.</b>

450
00:41:44.704 --> 00:41:45.932
<b>The way I figure it...</b>

451
00:41:45.972 --> 00:41:49.669
<b>these are your choices...
you can either cut and run...</b>


452
00:41:49.709 --> 00:41:51.301
<b>or you can wait
until my team comes in...</b>


453
00:41:51.344 --> 00:41:53.869
<b>and then you can try to run...</b>

454
00:41:53.913 --> 00:41:56.074
<b>or you can cooperate
right now...</b>


455
00:41:56.116 --> 00:41:58.175
<b>and save everyone
a whole lot of trouble.</b>


456
00:42:03.957 --> 00:42:07.154
<b>I believe you left out
some of my options.</b>


457
00:42:07.193 --> 00:42:11.425
<b>One, I could kill you
and the prisoners.</b>


458
00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:14.223
<b>Yes. Missed that one.</b>

459
00:42:14.267 --> 00:42:18.431
<b>And two... I can simply
lock you up...</b>


460
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:22.567
<b>and wait until you're ready
to give the signal.</b>


461
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:24.133
<b>Yes, you could lock me up...</b>

462
00:42:24.177 --> 00:42:25.906
<b>but I'll never give you
the signal.</b>


463
00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:27.173
<b>I don't care if you kill me.</b>

464
00:42:27.213 --> 00:42:30.376
<b>Now, look, I'm tired of
hanging around under this sun...</b>


465
00:42:30.417 --> 00:42:32.942
<b>playing footsie with
a half-pint would-be dictator.</b>


466
00:42:52.806 --> 00:42:55.297
<b>Give him anything he wants.</b>

467
00:42:55.342 --> 00:42:56.468
<b>I can't believe it!</b>

468
00:42:56.509 --> 00:42:59.307
<b>We're going home!</b>

469
00:42:59.346 --> 00:43:02.804
<b>OK. I want to know who won
the World Series last year.</b>


470
00:43:02.849 --> 00:43:05.613
<b>I don't know anything about
any bloody World Series, mate.</b>


471
00:43:05.652 --> 00:43:06.778
<b>I'm Australian.</b>

472
00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.151
<b>Forget it. I love you anyway.</b>

473
00:43:12.425 --> 00:43:14.086
<b>Yin won't give up this easy.</b>

474
00:43:14.127 --> 00:43:15.992
<b>How large is your rescue team?</b>

475
00:43:16.029 --> 00:43:17.519
<b>Large enough to kick
Yin's ass, huh?</b>


476
00:43:21.034 --> 00:43:22.023
<b>I'm alone.</b>

477
00:43:26.506 --> 00:43:27.837
<b>Alone?</b>

478
00:43:27.874 --> 00:43:29.569
<b>Nobody knows I'm here, mate.</b>

479
00:43:31.277 --> 00:43:33.472
<b>Man, there's nobody
gonna come and get me.</b>


480
00:43:33.513 --> 00:43:35.743
<b>But the International
Freedom House...</b>


481
00:43:35.782 --> 00:43:37.613
<b>The Central Team,
The homing device?</b>


482
00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:39.777
<b>It's just a bluff, isn't it?
I had to tell him something.</b>


483
00:43:39.819 --> 00:43:41.377
<b>I've heard rumors
about this place.</b>


484
00:43:41.421 --> 00:43:42.683
<b>I followed Francois in.</b>

485
00:43:42.722 --> 00:43:44.280
<b>I'm just a lousy
photographer, mate.</b>


486
00:43:44.324 --> 00:43:46.622
<b>I needed pictures for proof.</b>

487
00:43:46.659 --> 00:43:47.785
<b>Damn!</b>

488
00:43:47.827 --> 00:43:51.319
<b>One thing for sure,
he's got guts.</b>


489
00:43:51.364 --> 00:43:56.734
<b>Yeah. Nobody ever broke
into a prison camp.</b>


490
00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.603
<b>All right, then, let's get out.
We'll head for the cliffs.</b>


491
00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:00.765
<b>Anything happens to me...</b>

492
00:44:00.807 --> 00:44:02.035
<b>I stashed
some ropes under a big rock.</b>


493
00:44:02.075 --> 00:44:03.337
<b>You can't miss it.
Head for the Thai border...</b>


494
00:44:03.376 --> 00:44:04.741
<b>100 miles due west.
Come on, let's go.</b>


495
00:44:04.778 --> 00:44:08.111
<b>Wait. Yin may let you go...</b>

496
00:44:08.148 --> 00:44:10.412
<b>but he certainly
won't let us all go.</b>


497
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:11.678
<b>What's that?</b>

498
00:44:11.718 --> 00:44:14.812
<b>It's Francois coming
to pick up his whores.</b>


499
00:44:14.854 --> 00:44:16.719
<b>Shit. He knows I'm alone.</b>

500
00:44:16.756 --> 00:44:17.745
<b>Well, move it!</b>

501
00:44:21.928 --> 00:44:24.089
<b>I'm just going to give
the signal, mate.</b>


502
00:44:34.808 --> 00:44:36.275
<b>Mr. Emerson.</b>

503
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:37.537
<b>I'm just gonna give my signal.</b>

504
00:44:37.577 --> 00:44:38.703
<b>Good.</b>

505
00:44:38.745 --> 00:44:40.212
<b>Damn.</b>

506
00:44:40.246 --> 00:44:42.908
<b>I hope everyone's told you
how well they have been treated.</b>


507
00:44:42.949 --> 00:44:44.280
<b>Well, they don't love you,
but all in all...</b>


508
00:44:44.317 --> 00:44:45.784
<b>they look pretty good.
I'll be right back.</b>


509
00:44:45.819 --> 00:44:47.309
<b>One more moment, please.</b>

510
00:44:49.923 --> 00:44:52.118
<b>I would like you to meet
a friend of mine.</b>


511
00:44:52.158 --> 00:44:54.092
<b>I'll meet him later.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.</b>


512
00:44:54.127 --> 00:44:56.459
<b>I wouldn't want the Central Team
to get impatient, you know.</b>


513
00:44:56.496 --> 00:44:57.690
<b>Francois.</b>

514
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:02.760
<b>What's the matter, my friend?
You look a little nervous.</b>


515
00:45:02.802 --> 00:45:05.965
<b>He is the goddamn guy who's
been asking questions about us.</b>


516
00:45:06.005 --> 00:45:10.237
<b>He claims he's the point man
for a major rescue operation.</b>


517
00:45:10.276 --> 00:45:13.575
<b>He's lying. 
He's alone.</b>

518
00:45:13.613 --> 00:45:15.581
<b>I've still got the homing
device out in the jungle.</b>


519
00:45:22.722 --> 00:45:25.350
<b>I am weary of playing footsie
with you.</b>


520
00:45:27.927 --> 00:45:29.155
<b>Take him to the tree.</b>

521
00:45:32.432 --> 00:45:33.626
<b>Move!</b>

522
00:45:51.518 --> 00:45:55.511
<b>For the crimes against
the people of Vietnam...</b>


523
00:45:55.555 --> 00:45:57.455
<b>I sentence you to death.</b>

524
00:46:02.462 --> 00:46:04.692
<b>Don't worry! 
It's not real!</b>

525
00:46:04.731 --> 00:46:06.358
<b>He's just trying to scare you!</b>

526
00:46:06.399 --> 00:46:08.458
<b>They've got
a lousy sense of humor.</b>


527
00:46:23.917 --> 00:46:26.818
<b>Get up. Get up.</b>

528
00:46:28.221 --> 00:46:29.882
<b>Shut up, you asshole.</b>

529
00:46:29.923 --> 00:46:31.151
<b>You...</b>

530
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.782
<b>We'll get him up.</b>

531
00:46:32.825 --> 00:46:33.883
<b>OK, OK.</b>

532
00:46:36.195 --> 00:46:37.924
<b>I'm OK.</b>

533
00:46:48.441 --> 00:46:49.430
<b>Captain Ho?</b>

534
00:47:07.627 --> 00:47:08.855
<b>He's dying.</b>

535
00:47:24.644 --> 00:47:25.633
<b>Yin!</b>

536
00:47:43.296 --> 00:47:44.854
<b>No, don't do it.</b>

537
00:47:44.897 --> 00:47:46.057
<b>He has to.</b>

538
00:47:48.735 --> 00:47:49.929
<b>What the hell's the difference?</b>

539
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.138
<b>Our struggle was a long one.</b>

540
00:47:57.176 --> 00:48:00.475
<b>As I predicted, you lost.</b>

541
00:48:00.513 --> 00:48:07.077
<b>I'm glad you finally understand
the extent of your guilt.</b>


542
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.417
<b>You do, don't you?</b>

543
00:48:08.454 --> 00:48:10.786
<b>He don't understand shit!</b>

544
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:16.689
<b>Yes, Colonel Yin...</b>

545
00:48:18.498 --> 00:48:20.159
<b>I understand.</b>

546
00:48:34.914 --> 00:48:36.245
<b>Let's get him up.</b>

547
00:48:41.788 --> 00:48:43.016
<b>Colonel Braddock.</b>

548
00:48:45.825 --> 00:48:48.020
<b>I believe you have
forgotten something.</b>


549
00:49:05.712 --> 00:49:08.112
<b>Now, my American P.O. W...</b>

550
00:49:08.147 --> 00:49:11.844
<b>I will live up to my promise
and will let you go free.</b>


551
00:49:11.884 --> 00:49:15.945
<b>Tomorrow, Francois will be here
and will fly you to Thailand...</b>


552
00:49:15.988 --> 00:49:18.456
<b>and deliver you to your embassy.</b>

553
00:49:18.491 --> 00:49:20.516
<b>You see, Colonel? 
I told you.</b>

554
00:49:22.528 --> 00:49:24.655
<b>I will try to make
your last day here...</b>


555
00:49:24.697 --> 00:49:26.187
<b>as comfortable as possible.</b>

556
00:49:26.232 --> 00:49:30.498
<b>Here. Come into the next room.
You'll stay there tonight.</b>


557
00:49:54.594 --> 00:49:56.562
<b>I can't believe it.</b>

558
00:49:56.596 --> 00:49:58.325
<b>It's over. We're going home.</b>

559
00:49:58.364 --> 00:50:00.025
<b>I'm going to see my kid!</b>

560
00:50:01.434 --> 00:50:02.833
<b>Something's wrong.</b>

561
00:50:02.869 --> 00:50:04.063
<b>Nothing's wrong.</b>

562
00:50:04.103 --> 00:50:05.400
<b>You've just been here too long.</b>

563
00:50:05.438 --> 00:50:06.769
<b>You're in shock.</b>

564
00:50:06.806 --> 00:50:08.137
<b>I am feeling better.</b>

565
00:50:08.174 --> 00:50:09.334
<b>Yeah, you're feeling better.</b>

566
00:50:16.682 --> 00:50:18.547
<b>Nothing works this fast.</b>

567
00:50:21.087 --> 00:50:23.078
<b>Oh, God! Get him up, Mazilli!</b>

568
00:50:23.122 --> 00:50:24.680
<b>He's been poisoned!</b>

569
00:50:24.724 --> 00:50:26.885
<b>Come on, Franklin!</b>

570
00:50:26.926 --> 00:50:28.052
<b>Come on, on both legs.</b>

571
00:50:28.094 --> 00:50:29.220
<b>Walk!</b>

572
00:50:29.262 --> 00:50:30.957
<b>- Come on.
- Walk, Franklin.</b>


573
00:50:30.997 --> 00:50:33.431
<b>Come on, walk it.
Walk, Franklin!</b>


574
00:50:33.466 --> 00:50:35.593
<b>Is this an American
funeral rite?</b>


575
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:43.941
<b>I'm afraid I gave poor Franklin
such an overdose of opium...</b>


576
00:50:43.976 --> 00:50:47.605
<b>that he could walk
from here to Los Angeles...</b>


577
00:50:47.647 --> 00:50:49.706
<b>and would not do him any good.</b>

578
00:50:53.486 --> 00:50:54.612
<b>Throw him in the hole.</b>

579
00:50:54.654 --> 00:50:56.645
<b>You son of a bitch.</b>

580
00:51:43.403 --> 00:51:44.700
<b>Wait!</b>

581
00:51:46.306 --> 00:51:49.833
<b>Yin, wait!</b>

582
00:51:49.877 --> 00:51:51.344
<b>Yin!</b>

583
00:51:55.249 --> 00:51:56.739
<b>He's not dead!</b>

584
00:52:00.554 --> 00:52:02.044
<b>God, no!</b>

585
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:03.681
<b>Oh, God!</b>

586
00:52:10.464 --> 00:52:11.692
<b>Son of a bitch.</b>

587
00:59:01.341 --> 00:59:05.607
<b>Mazilli, I thought
you should know...</b>


588
00:59:05.645 --> 00:59:07.636
<b>that you're completely alone.</b>

589
00:59:07.681 --> 00:59:12.482
<b>Your brave colonel has abandoned
you to die here.</b>


590
00:59:12.519 --> 00:59:13.747
<b>Braddock got away?</b>

591
00:59:13.787 --> 00:59:15.254
<b>He'll die tomorrow.</b>

592
00:59:16.656 --> 00:59:17.816
<b>So will you.</b>

593
00:59:19.192 --> 00:59:20.523
<b>In the meantime...</b>

594
00:59:23.863 --> 00:59:25.694
<b>if you're lonely...</b>

595
00:59:28.935 --> 00:59:30.732
<b>play with your friend.</b>

596
00:59:54.527 --> 00:59:55.892
<b>More wine, Colonel?</b>

597
00:59:55.929 --> 00:59:56.918
<b>No.</b>

598
01:00:00.567 --> 01:00:02.296
<b>Braddock gone!</b>

599
01:00:02.335 --> 01:00:03.734
<b>Why keep him alive?</b>

600
01:00:05.639 --> 01:00:07.038
<b>Now, you know,
I might be wrong...</b>


601
01:00:07.073 --> 01:00:10.804
<b>but I don't think it's
a very good idea to kill me.</b>


602
01:00:10.844 --> 01:00:13.176
<b>Why not?</b>

603
01:00:13.213 --> 01:00:16.273
<b>I could always get
someone to pour my wine.</b>


604
01:00:19.452 --> 01:00:22.012
<b>It's because
I'm the only one left...</b>


605
01:00:22.055 --> 01:00:25.286
<b>who really knows how
Colonel Braddock thinks.</b>


606
01:00:25.325 --> 01:00:26.758
<b>See, he hasn't gone yet.</b>

607
01:00:29.296 --> 01:00:30.786
<b>Is that so?</b>

608
01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:34.698
<b>Yes. He has stayed to try
and take revenge on you.</b>


609
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:44.733
<b>I will use Francois' helicopter.</b>

610
01:00:44.778 --> 01:00:46.473
<b>We will capture him tomorrow.</b>

611
01:00:50.583 --> 01:00:53.245
<b>We should have killed that guy
a long time ago.</b>


612
01:03:18.832 --> 01:03:20.527
<b>We'd better get back.</b>

613
01:03:20.567 --> 01:03:22.296
<b>You'll never find
this guy alive.</b>


614
01:03:22.335 --> 01:03:23.495
<b>Just keep searching.</b>

615
01:04:46.085 --> 01:04:47.985
<b>Braddock come back,
blow bridge down.</b>


616
01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:50.285
<b>Lock up all the prisoners
and Nester!</b>


617
01:04:50.323 --> 01:04:51.483
<b>You, to the bridge!</b>

618
01:04:55.261 --> 01:04:56.421
<b>In there.</b>

619
01:05:04.637 --> 01:05:06.605
<b>I'll bury him with this.</b>

620
01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:11.772
<b>My God! It's a bomb!</b>

621
01:05:11.811 --> 01:05:12.800
<b>Get out!</b>

622
01:05:21.888 --> 01:05:23.287
<b>Damn American!</b>

623
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:58.516
<b>Open it.</b>

624
01:05:58.558 --> 01:05:59.547
<b>Mazilli!</b>

625
01:06:02.161 --> 01:06:03.492
<b>What the hell?</b>

626
01:06:03.529 --> 01:06:05.326
<b>Braddock!</b>

627
01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:06.389
<b>Let's go!</b>

628
01:06:08.835 --> 01:06:09.767
<b>Duck!</b>

629
01:06:15.074 --> 01:06:16.507
<b>Come on! Come on!</b>

630
01:07:04.857 --> 01:07:07.849
<b>Damn! We got to find that rope.</b>

631
01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:15.999
<b>They're getting too close.
Let's get out of here.</b>


632
01:07:16.035 --> 01:07:17.332
<b>It's got to be here.</b>

633
01:07:20.173 --> 01:07:21.663
<b>Emerson said
they were under a big rock.</b>


634
01:07:21.708 --> 01:07:23.073
<b>There must be 60 big rocks.</b>

635
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.869
<b>Here it is!</b>

636
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:31.939
<b>Here.</b>

637
01:07:46.499 --> 01:07:47.761
<b>Good luck, kid.</b>

638
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.268
<b>- Aren't you coming?
- I'm going after Ho.</b>


639
01:07:50.303 --> 01:07:53.500
<b>If you're staying to fight,
there's no way I'm leaving you.</b>


640
01:07:53.539 --> 01:07:55.973
<b>Here they come!
Get your ass down the cliff!</b>


641
01:12:06.058 --> 01:12:07.389
<b>You idiot!</b>

642
01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.760
<b>Come in.</b>

643
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:20.496
<b>So, Yin, we're all loaded up.</b>

644
01:12:20.539 --> 01:12:23.099
<b>I'll see you in about a week.</b>

645
01:12:23.142 --> 01:12:26.805
<b>Francois, I will need
your helicopter...</b>


646
01:12:26.846 --> 01:12:28.245
<b>to look for the Americans.</b>

647
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.145
<b>I believe they've gone down
the river.</b>


648
01:12:30.182 --> 01:12:31.911
<b>I am sorry. 
I can't help you.</b>

649
01:12:31.951 --> 01:12:33.282
<b>You will not go.</b>

650
01:12:34.887 --> 01:12:37.185
<b>I am going.</b>

651
01:12:37.223 --> 01:12:38.656
<b>Come on, let's go.</b>

652
01:12:38.691 --> 01:12:42.127
<b>Get your hands off...
What the hell are you doing?</b>


653
01:12:42.161 --> 01:12:44.425
<b>They are following my order.</b>

654
01:12:45.765 --> 01:12:50.759
<b>They needed a new leader after
they heard that you had died.</b>


655
01:14:16.956 --> 01:14:17.945
<b>Ho.</b>

656
01:16:07.032 --> 01:16:08.226
<b>Opelka.</b>

657
01:16:08.267 --> 01:16:09.427
<b>Colonel.</b>

658
01:16:18.077 --> 01:16:19.442
<b>I'm glad you made it, kid.</b>

659
01:16:19.478 --> 01:16:22.777
<b>Thanks, Colonel.
Yin must have given up on me.</b>


660
01:16:22.815 --> 01:16:24.077
<b>He thought you were dead.</b>

661
01:16:25.818 --> 01:16:27.479
<b>How come you hung around?</b>

662
01:16:27.519 --> 01:16:28.679
<b>I don't know.</b>

663
01:16:30.155 --> 01:16:32.020
<b>I guess it was just
some kind of instinct.</b>


664
01:16:37.963 --> 01:16:40.363
<b>I want you to guard the base.</b>

665
01:16:40.399 --> 01:16:42.128
<b>If I'm not back in 24 hours...</b>

666
01:16:42.167 --> 01:16:43.896
<b>go down the river
and try to find Mazilli.</b>


667
01:16:46.171 --> 01:16:51.438
<b>Colonel, I know you don't need
me to guard the base.</b>


668
01:16:51.477 --> 01:16:53.707
<b>I want to help you
get those bastards.</b>


669
01:17:03.422 --> 01:17:04.582
<b>Colonel Braddock!</b>

670
01:17:17.002 --> 01:17:18.936
<b>Yin's our enemy, too.</b>

671
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.600
<b>I'll kill him!</b>

672
01:17:24.009 --> 01:17:27.536
<b>The fighting's over!
We all go home!</b>


673
01:17:29.248 --> 01:17:30.374
<b>Colonel Braddock!</b>

674
01:17:30.416 --> 01:17:31.405
<b>Dou Chou.</b>

675
01:17:34.019 --> 01:17:35.680
<b>He's listening.
He knows we're here.</b>


676
01:17:44.697 --> 01:17:47.257
<b>Yin dead. Believe now.</b>

677
01:17:47.299 --> 01:17:49.199
<b>See, Colonel Braddock?</b>

678
01:17:50.769 --> 01:17:52.703
<b>Come look for yourself.
Yin dead!</b>


679
01:17:56.141 --> 01:17:58.575
<b>Sir, the boots. 
That's not Yin.</b>

680
01:18:13.926 --> 01:18:15.052
<b>I'm going after Ho.</b>

681
01:18:15.094 --> 01:18:16.789
<b>He's in one of those two shacks
down there.</b>


682
01:18:16.829 --> 01:18:20.788
<b>If there's any fireworks,
here, throw these grenades.</b>


683
01:18:22.234 --> 01:18:24.828
<b>Sir, what about Nester?</b>

684
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:26.804
<b>He can take care of himself.</b>

685
01:18:26.839 --> 01:18:27.999
<b>He always has.</b>

686
01:18:32.077 --> 01:18:33.237
<b>He won't show.</b>

687
01:18:39.318 --> 01:18:40.478
<b>He'll come.</b>

688
01:19:00.539 --> 01:19:02.507
<b>Good. They got Mazilli.</b>

689
01:19:02.541 --> 01:19:03.530
<b>Let's go.</b>

690
01:19:21.026 --> 01:19:23.085
<b>Colonel Braddock!</b>

691
01:19:33.272 --> 01:19:36.901
<b>I'll give you

693
01:20:02.167 --> 01:20:04.362
<b>Your 30 seconds is up!</b>

694
01:20:05.737 --> 01:20:10.037
<b>You have just murdered
your last man.</b>


695
01:20:10.075 --> 01:20:12.543
<b>Psst. Mazilli...</b>

696
01:20:12.578 --> 01:20:14.808
<b>anything you want me
to tell your kid?</b>


697
01:20:17.683 --> 01:20:19.480
<b>Hold it!</b>

698
01:20:19.518 --> 01:20:20.815
<b>Mazilli is mine.</b>

699
01:20:22.788 --> 01:20:24.813
<b>Why don't we just tell
the kid that Daddy...</b>


700
01:20:24.857 --> 01:20:30.193
<b>was a very brave soldier
right up till the very end?</b>


701
01:20:35.234 --> 01:20:36.292
<b>Down!</b>

702
01:20:39.905 --> 01:20:41.202
<b>Move it, Mazilli!</b>

703
01:21:06.365 --> 01:21:08.697
<b>Nester... he came back to us.</b>

704
01:21:08.734 --> 01:21:09.723
<b>Yeah, I know.</b>

705
01:21:11.069 --> 01:21:12.229
<b>I'm going after Ho.</b>

706
01:21:34.092 --> 01:21:35.923
<b>Cover us, Ho. 
We're going in.</b>

707
01:21:45.103 --> 01:21:48.072
<b>Colonel, they're all
in Yin's house.</b>


708
01:21:48.106 --> 01:21:49.334
<b>Opelka!</b>

709
01:21:49.374 --> 01:21:50.363
<b>Lieutenant.</b>

710
01:21:55.247 --> 01:21:56.737
<b>Opelka, left flank.</b>

711
01:21:58.283 --> 01:22:00.911
<b>Mazilli, around back.</b>

712
01:22:00.953 --> 01:22:02.079
<b>Wait.</b>

713
01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.020
<b>Ready? Go!</b>

714
01:22:04.056 --> 01:22:05.353
<b>Now!</b>

715
01:23:43.221 --> 01:23:44.654
<b>Nobody could have lived
through this.</b>


716
01:23:46.591 --> 01:23:47.580
<b>Colonel.</b>

717
01:24:11.383 --> 01:24:12.873
<b>Remember how to fly this thing?</b>

718
01:24:12.918 --> 01:24:14.078
<b>You better believe it.</b>

719
01:25:17.716 --> 01:25:19.775
<b>You really didn't think
I'd leave...</b>


720
01:25:19.818 --> 01:25:21.479
<b>without knowing for sure
you were dead?</b>


721
01:25:24.556 --> 01:25:26.786
<b>You'll not just kill me.</b>

722
01:25:26.825 --> 01:25:29.988
<b>You want to know
who the better man is.</b>


723
01:25:31.329 --> 01:25:35.629
<b>That is why you stayed behind.</b>

724
01:25:35.667 --> 01:25:38.227
<b>I also want to know.</b>

725
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:42.707
<b>That is why I kept you alive
all these years.</b>


726
01:25:46.011 --> 01:25:48.536
<b>Now it is the time...</b>

727
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.710
<b>You and I, one-on-one.</b>

728

<b>No politics...</b>

729
01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.910
<b>no weapons.</b>

730
01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:10.258
<b>Just a little game to find out
who is the better man.</b>


731
01:26:15.607 --> 01:26:18.576
<b>I knew you could not
resist my challenge.</b>


732
01:26:27.085 --> 01:26:30.521
<b>Colonel Yin,
for the atrocities inflicted...</b>

<b>on the Vietnamese and American
prisoners of this camp...</b>


734

<b>I sentence you to death.</b>

735
01:28:41.553 --> 01:28:42.952
<b>This is for Nester.</b>

736
01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:53.558
<b>Not yet.</b>

737
01:29:24.896 --> 01:29:26.761
<b>The game's over.</b>

738
01:30:03.468 --> 01:30:05.197
<b>And this is for Franklin.</b>

739
01:30:14.712 --> 01:30:16.043
<b>You lose.</b>

740
01:31:13.104 --> 01:31:14.264
<b>This is for me.</b>
