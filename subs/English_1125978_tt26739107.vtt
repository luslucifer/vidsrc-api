[host 1] Please join me in welcoming...

00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:50.388
- [host 2] Mr. Hideo Kojima.
- [host 3] Hideo Kojima.


5
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:53.805
[host 3] One of the most creative talents
in the history of gaming.

00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:09.763
In the space of
gaming, he is the master.

10
00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:11.680
- Absolutely love your work.
- Thank you.


11
00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:13.263
[Del Toro] You can tell
it's a Hideo Kojima game


12
00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:15.555
even if that credit wasn't there.

13
00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:17.096
No way.

14
00:01:17.888 --> 00:01:21.513
[Keighley] Video games
are the biggest, most powerful form


15
00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:23.763
of entertainment in the world

16
00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:26.805
and the numbers clearly show that

17
00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:30.888
more than three billion people
on the planet play video games.


18

[crowd cheering]

19
00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:38.263
And Hideo really is probably
the most well-known game creator


20
00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:39.346
in the world.

21
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.346
It's kind of like stepping
into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory


22
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.971
with Willy Wonka, you know?

23
00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:48.930
[Reedus] You just kind of
go along for the ride.

[♪ pensive music playing]

25
00:01:54.388 --> 00:01:57.138
[Refn] I think that
it's the obligation of any artist


26
00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:00.888
to push the boundaries of their canvas.

30
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.846
[Miller] I'm really interested
in how people think creatively,


31
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.430
no matter what the discipline.

32
00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:33.096
Any form of artistry,
the process is the same almost always.


33
00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:39.305
And that is an interplay
between the intellect and the intuition.

43
00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:34.596
The story from back
in the day was that

44
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.180
Hideo wanted to go and pitch a game

45
00:04:36.263 --> 00:04:38.013
but he didn't want to tell anyone
what it was.


46
00:04:38.096 --> 00:04:40.555
He really wanted someone
to sign up for the game


47
00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:42.263
without hearing what the game was.

48
00:04:42.346 --> 00:04:44.971
And everyone in the Western world
was like, "You're crazy."


49
00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:46.346
We know you're Hideo Kojima

50
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.971
but we're not going to sign up your game
until we know what you're making.


51
00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:58.138
[Keighley] And Sony,
as far as I know, basically said,


52
00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:01.805
"We're going to bet on you,
Hideo Kojima, as a creator."


53
00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:03.596
We don't even need to know
what the game is.


54
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.846
We're just in.

[♪ tense music playing]

68
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.471
He is not someone
that just sort of rinses and repeats.


69
00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:50.888
He really tries to, to reinvent
how the game is played.


70
00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:54.346
But overarching all that is this view

71
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.680
that he wants to communicate something
to the player.


72
00:08:57.763 --> 00:09:00.846
He really has a message
that he wants to deliver in every game


73
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.180
that he hopes translates to the player.

74
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.596
[Keighley] Like every game he makes,
there's a reason behind making the game.

[Miller] In the collaborative

115
00:19:51.055 --> 00:19:54.221
there's usually one voice ultimately.

[indistinct chatter]

117
00:19:55.846 --> 00:20:01.138
The person who is that driving force
has to do one very important thing

00:20:01.221 --> 00:20:07.346
and that is create the strategies

and the strongest ideas survive.

122
00:20:35.638 --> 00:20:37.513
They keep coming back to you
they won't let you go


123
00:20:37.596 --> 00:20:40.013
until you become
a little bit obsessed with them.


124
00:20:41.805 --> 00:20:46.221
[Miller] And you go from a very divergent,
broad view of the work,


125
00:20:46.305 --> 00:20:50.430
and you bounce down
into a very, very highly focused,


126
00:20:50.513 --> 00:20:52.513
granular level of the work.

127
00:20:52.596 --> 00:20:54.555
And it's bouncing between the two.

128
00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:12.930
[Miller] The extent
that they can articulate that


129
00:21:13.013 --> 00:21:16.888
and convey it to the others
and inspire others working with them.


130
00:21:16.971 --> 00:21:20.555
Then the work
will be a comprehensive whole.

Being across every single aspect
is incredible to me,

I first heard of Hideo
through Guillermo del Toro.


149
00:26:14.388 --> 00:26:18.971
So Guillermo called me and said,
"Hey, there's this guy.

00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:21.430
He's going to call you. Just say, 'Yes'."

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:22.596
And I was like,
"What are you talking about?"


152
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.763
And he's like,
"Just whatever he says, say 'Yes'."

"Hey, this package is from Fragile."


157
00:26:35.471 --> 00:26:38.888
And so many times, I had to stop and go,
"Hold on a second, hold on a second."


158

"So, what you're saying is..."

159

it's about the story, about the character,

00:26:43.721 --> 00:26:50.430
about the breadth
and immensity of the design, um...


161
00:26:50.513 --> 00:26:52.055
how it was going
to relate to the player

162
00:26:52.138 --> 00:26:54.513
and how those players
were going to relate to each other.


163
00:26:55.638 --> 00:26:58.721
The story and the experiences just
kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.


164
00:27:00.846 --> 00:27:04.971
[Reedus] <i>There's so many moments that
I've had with him where I'm like, "What?</i>


165
00:27:05.055 --> 00:27:07.388
<i>Like, what are you talking about?"</i>

166
00:27:08.846 --> 00:27:13.013
And then at some point, she's
kind of warped in front of you, okay?


167
00:27:13.096 --> 00:27:14.430
Like, being, like...

168
00:27:14.513 --> 00:27:16.013
[Baker] Makes sense now, man.

169
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:18.888
[Reedus] Make so much sense.

170
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.680
It was confusing for a lot of us

171
00:27:21.763 --> 00:27:25.930
because the story is so intricate
and it's so deep.


172
00:27:26.013 --> 00:27:31.930
It was very confusing
but what was done in such a great way is,


173
00:27:32.013 --> 00:27:34.221
I was felt like
I was sort of drip-fed,

174
00:27:34.305 --> 00:27:37.930
whatever my brain could handle
at that moment in time.


175
00:27:39.013 --> 00:27:40.221
[Jenkins] Captain,

176
00:27:42.555 --> 00:27:45.846
I need you to hand him over.

177
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.263
[actor] Shoot him, John.

178
00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:52.430
Let him go.

179
00:27:54.138 --> 00:27:55.263
Please.

180
00:27:56.305 --> 00:27:57.513
Shoot him!

181
00:27:58.638 --> 00:28:00.930
I gave you an order. Shoot him.

182
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:09.305
- Guys on Monday...
- I wanna, bye.


183
00:28:11.721 --> 00:28:14.305
[Baker] Trust in this medium is key.

184
00:28:14.388 --> 00:28:18.305
It is the bedrock foundation
for many reasons.


185
00:28:18.388 --> 00:28:22.180
Number one,
everything is in an abstraction.


186
00:28:22.263 --> 00:28:23.930
Everything is vague.

187
00:28:24.013 --> 00:28:25.346
- [director 1] Good, Mark. Take three.
- [Mark] All right.


188
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.096
[Baker] There's just four white walls
with a bunch of cameras.


189
00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.680
Right, we're all set.

190
00:28:31.471 --> 00:28:33.263
Ready? Action.

191
00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:38.138
Oh, Sam Bridges.

192
00:28:38.221 --> 00:28:40.138
[Baker] So trust is at
the root of it all.

193
00:28:40.221 --> 00:28:42.055
So...

194
00:28:42.138 --> 00:28:43.555
Fragile...

195
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.388
[Higgs] <i>Like the world
and everything in it.</i>


196
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.055
Me? I'm...

197
00:28:51.638 --> 00:28:53.138
I'm no exception.

198
00:28:55.846 --> 00:28:58.096
[Baker] Let's not forget little old you.

199
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:01.680
[Reedus groaning]

200
00:29:02.263 --> 00:29:05.596
I know it ain't easy wearing a mask
all the time.


201
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.471
[Higgs] But now the mask
can come off, right?


202
00:29:10.888 --> 00:29:12.888
[panting]

203
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.388
[Reedus] The more he would tell me,
the more I would understand.


204
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:21.888
And you have to understand,
I started making this game


205
00:29:21.971 --> 00:29:24.596
not knowing anything
about what anybody's talking about.


206
00:29:27.096 --> 00:29:30.471
So as the trust got deeper and stronger,

207
00:29:30.555 --> 00:29:34.138
the storyline got more revealed to me
in a way that I could understand it.


208
00:29:38.305 --> 00:29:42.805
And I knew we were doing something
really special. You know?


209
00:29:43.888 --> 00:29:45.763
We want the player, same flashback...

210
00:29:45.846 --> 00:29:48.596
[Mikkelsen] Every time we think
we have an idea of what this is about,


211
00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.471
it's just another layer and another layer.

212
00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:52.096
Except me. I see you,
and I talk to you.

213
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.805
And I tell you that you must...

214
00:29:54.888 --> 00:29:56.971
[Reedus] Just point me, just tell me...

215
00:29:57.055 --> 00:29:58.055
Yeah.

216
00:29:58.138 --> 00:29:59.596
- [laughter]
- And I'm like...


217
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.763
When you throw that away
and lose your fear,


218
00:30:01.846 --> 00:30:04.263
all of a sudden, there's a certain freedom
in working like this.

You can just look at him and look at what
he's creating over there in the corner.


221
00:30:12.888 --> 00:30:15.846
You say, "You know what?
I think I'm in good hands."


222
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.305

Sam.

- I see him.
- Mm.

Okay, back down

- Got you. Yes.

Okay, here we go.
Rolling when you are ready, sir.

00:32:38.263 --> 00:32:39.721
Open fire.

252
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.221
Open fire.

253
00:32:43.096 --> 00:32:44.805
[Mikkelsen] It feels quite open.

254
00:32:44.888 --> 00:32:46.430
And he's very pleased, obviously,

255
00:32:46.513 --> 00:32:49.596
because whatever we do,
that's not the end result.


256
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.138
He just, he needs
us to do the base.

257
00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:54.388
[Mikkelsen] Disengage!

258
00:32:56.971 --> 00:32:58.721
Time to go, boys.

259
00:32:58.805 --> 00:33:02.680
[Mikkelsen] And the more we can give him
real emotions or whatever in that base,


260
00:33:02.763 --> 00:33:04.180
the happier he gets.

<i>Don't let me down, boys.</i>

262
00:33:08.888 --> 00:33:11.930
[Mikkelsen] He's famous for being
a storyteller in his games.


263
00:33:13.805 --> 00:33:17.096
It's mayhem with the assassin's war.

264
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.388
But there's a certain beauty,
a certain poetry to the entire image.


265
00:33:22.805 --> 00:33:27.013
And I think that's also one of the keys
to why his games are so incredibly popular


266
00:33:27.096 --> 00:33:29.388
because they have both sides of the coin.

270
00:33:47.596 --> 00:33:50.555
It was interesting
because it's a world that I didn't know,


271
00:33:50.638 --> 00:33:52.721
the world of video games.

Okay, same kind of thing here, right?

you've been waiting for.

[Refn] Being original is hard.

296
00:35:49.638 --> 00:35:53.805
So most rely on an algorithm,

297

which is the enemy of creativity.

298
00:35:57.013 --> 00:36:01.971
And I see Hideo
as the enemy of the algorithm.


299
00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:05.846
What I think is unique,
is his sense of pacing,


300
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.221
his sense of drama.

301

I admire it.

302
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.096
It can go in detours

303
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.263
that the Western discipline
of storytelling would not go to,


304
00:36:16.346 --> 00:36:19.388
and therefore, it makes it very impactful.

is a very strange man.

00:36:38.888 --> 00:36:40.305
I think he likes,

310
00:36:42.096 --> 00:36:45.430
he likes to tell stories
in a way that is bizarre.


311

That is not usual.

312
00:36:50.638 --> 00:36:55.096

between, like, comedy

if it's a joke or not.

but also, like, deeply sad.

[Hulst] Before Hideo Kojima
made <i>Metal Gear</i>,


320
00:37:18.138 --> 00:37:21.013
everything was about engaging,
about combat.


321
00:37:21.096 --> 00:37:24.513
He turned it around
and it was now about avoiding combat.


322
00:37:24.596 --> 00:37:28.721
It was about hide and seek,
and stealth gameplay became a thing.

It was a thoughtful
approach to playing games


326
00:38:33.555 --> 00:38:36.013
and that really burst, you know,
the stealth genre


327
00:38:36.096 --> 00:38:38.471
which today is still used
in so many games.

[Woodkid] I think one
of the big qualities of his work


337
00:41:25.471 --> 00:41:29.305
is that it references other forms
of art constantly.

[Keighley] Welcome to
Countdown to <i>Death Stranding</i>.


354
00:48:51.805 --> 00:48:53.555
We are here in New York City.

355
00:48:53.638 --> 00:48:56.763
The World Strand Tour
has touched down here


356
00:48:56.846 --> 00:48:58.555
for an incredible experience

357
00:48:58.638 --> 00:49:01.555
and I'm honored to be joined
by Hideo Kojima


358
00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:05.055
on the day that <i>Death Stranding</i>
is launching around the world.


359
00:49:06.138 --> 00:49:07.680
[Keighley] I remember there
was a lot of tension when, you know,


360
00:49:07.763 --> 00:49:10.263
during the development of the game,
because everyone kept saying, well,


361
00:49:10.346 --> 00:49:12.388
"Where are the guns? 
Where's the fights?"

362
00:49:12.471 --> 00:49:14.346
And Hideo is like, "No.
It's about something different.


363
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:18.263
It's about just walking
and experiencing this world."


364
00:49:18.346 --> 00:49:21.430
And that's such a challenging idea.

365
00:49:21.513 --> 00:49:23.680
[audience cheering]

366
00:49:25.596 --> 00:49:30.846
[Woodkid] You can't give the audience
what they want all the time.


367
00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:33.555
You also have to make them understand

368
00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:35.721
that sometimes they want something
they don't know.


369
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:43.721
[audience cheering]

370
00:49:44.763 --> 00:49:47.596
[Miller] The risk is
that people just don't accept it.


371
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.513
It's too radical in some way.

372
00:49:56.305 --> 00:50:00.138
But of course,
the upside is that you change,


373
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:03.263
the medium that you're working in
and that's why


374
00:50:04.638 --> 00:50:07.096
his work is so important.

375
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.555
[crowd cheering]

376
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.680
Outside of AAA games,

377
00:50:12.763 --> 00:50:16.305
I think people often try and communicate
on a deeper level in gaming


378
00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:21.180
but that was the first time
I'd ever seen a game of that scale


379
00:50:21.263 --> 00:50:24.638
trying to go in a lot deeper
than what games would usually attempt.


380
00:50:43.346 --> 00:50:44.721
[Del Toro] When you play <i>Death Stranding</i>,

381
00:50:44.805 --> 00:50:49.138
the dynamics are exactly the opposite
of every other video game.


382
00:50:49.221 --> 00:50:53.763
You are taught virtues
that seem impossible in gaming.


383
00:50:53.846 --> 00:50:56.638
Patience, empathy, solidarity.

384
00:50:56.721 --> 00:51:00.971
It's the only game I've played
where I thought I was a better person


385
00:51:01.055 --> 00:51:03.138
at the end of the game ever.

386

[♪ epic music playing]

387
00:51:08.596 --> 00:51:11.555
[Grimes] I just love when, like,
really complex things are really popular,


388
00:51:11.638 --> 00:51:13.763
because it makes me feel like,

389
00:51:13.846 --> 00:51:18.180
mainstream audiences are, like, open
to, like, weird experimental art.


390

[birds squawking]

And that's always, like,

392
00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:25.971
I don't know, a thing that can give you
faith in humanity, I suppose.


393
00:51:31.638 --> 00:51:33.638
[♪ slow upbeat music]

394
00:51:36.388 --> 00:51:40.430
[Del Toro] The function of art,
and philosophy, and humanity is


395
00:51:40.513 --> 00:51:45.013
if you want to call them something,
is to enhance the human spirit.


396
00:51:45.096 --> 00:51:46.430
That's the function.

397
00:51:48.721 --> 00:51:50.721
And video gaming is an art.

398
00:51:50.805 --> 00:51:53.388
At its best is an art.

399
00:51:55.388 --> 00:51:58.513
That's where art has its meaning.

400
00:51:58.596 --> 00:52:01.513
It's not meant to please you, necessarily.

401
00:52:01.596 --> 00:52:03.930
It's meant to inspire you.

402
00:52:04.013 --> 00:52:06.138
It's meant to provoke you.

403
00:52:06.221 --> 00:52:08.930
[Refn] It's meant to entertain you.

404
00:52:09.013 --> 00:52:11.430
<i>Death Stranding</i>
has all those components in it.


405
00:52:11.513 --> 00:52:14.721
It's all there, but
it has so much more.

406
00:52:55.055 --> 00:52:56.596
[Baker] Tentacles just went out

407
00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.430
trying to find ways
to connect with people.


408
00:52:59.513 --> 00:53:03.096
And there was something
that games could do


409
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:07.471
that no show, no movie could do.

410
00:53:07.555 --> 00:53:09.096
Not as effectively.

411
00:53:09.763 --> 00:53:11.596
It's one of the things
that I love about this art form,


412
00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:16.263
is that you and I could go in
and look at a painting together


413
00:53:16.346 --> 00:53:17.805
and we can have a conversation.

414
00:53:17.888 --> 00:53:21.346
But there's a difference between
you and I picking up a paintbrush together


415
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.971
and painting something together.

416
00:53:24.055 --> 00:53:26.221
And that, to me, is what games
allow us to do.


417
00:53:26.305 --> 00:53:29.555
And that's especially what <i>Death Stranding</i>
at that time allowed us to do.


418
00:53:29.638 --> 00:53:32.721
When art is strong enough, it's prophetic.

419
00:53:33.888 --> 00:53:36.305
This was a COVID game before COVID.

420
00:53:36.971 --> 00:53:39.221
Uh, this was...

421
00:53:40.263 --> 00:53:44.846
a game that I think responded
to that shift


422
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:47.596
that the pandemic brought
before it occurred.


423

Uh...

426
00:54:53.638 --> 00:54:57.513
[Miller] There's no
cultural evolution, unless it is renewed.


427
00:54:58.596 --> 00:55:00.263
That's the history of all creative.

428
00:55:00.346 --> 00:55:02.680
It constantly has to be refreshed.

429
00:55:02.763 --> 00:55:04.846
And that's where the creative courage
comes in.

[♪ uplifting music playing]

[Refn] If we lose that singular vision,
we lose part of our humanity.


432
00:55:20.055 --> 00:55:24.180
And if you are 100 percent true
to yourself as an artist,


433

then your heart and soul
will always beat for the future.
