00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.209
So, you see the thing is, Dad,
I could reapply next year,


2
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.689
but if I defer and try again for Oxford,
I'll probably lose my place at Bristol...


3
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.729
Mm...

4
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.489
...which is a good university,
but not my dream.


5
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.969
Do you think it
matters in the long term,

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.409
or is the subject and standard of degree
more important?


7
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.889
So, I got married.

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.969
- What?!
- To Suzy, we got married.


9
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.049
You mean remarried.

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.889
This time it's for keeps, though.

11
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.729
- When did this happen?
- A few weeks ago.


12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.169
I was going to invite you, but I know
how you are around people.


13
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.889
How am I?!

14
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.489
Awkward. Weird.

15
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.929
I don't live in a cave.
I live in suburban London.


16
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.649
I spend my entire life around people.

17
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.849
Much as I'd like to,
it's almost impossible to avoid them.


18
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.369
See, this is what I mean.

19
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.849
Well... Was it a big wedding?

20
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.489
No. Couple of hundred close friends
and family.


21
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.129
- And it was perfect.
- Mm.


22
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.049
I can't believe you didn't invite me
to your wedding.


23
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.289
So, what are you up to this summer?

24
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.569
Oh, you're changing the subject?

25
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.969
- Mm-hm.
- Fine.


26
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.249
I dunno. I guess
I'll be going on holiday.

27
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.649
Oh, this should be good.
What have you got planned?


28
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.929
Trans-Siberian Express?
Fossil-hunting in Dorset?


29
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.689
Or maybe something even weirder.

30
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.089
No, actually. Something normal. I'm going
somewhere normal, with my normal friends,


31
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.449
to a place full of normal people.

32
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.769
And you, of course.

# Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love

36
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.089
# I really need it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.289
# Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love

38
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.129
# Just set me free, yeah... #

39
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.409
WILL: In case you were wondering,
that was me with my father.


40
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.329
And this is where I live - not with him,
but with my mother.


41
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.889
It's a long story. 
Well, not that long.

42
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.049
He shagged the work experience girl
and then left us.


43
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.769
So, just clichd, really.

44
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.729
Plus, it only happened two years ago,
so I don't even get the luxury


45
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.449
of blaming my various personality defects
on their divorce.


46
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.889
Anyway, that's how I ended up here -
the very definition of suburbia.


47
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.169
Safe, comforting, stifling, boring -
and I couldn't wait to fucking leave.


48
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.649
Maybe that's unfair, as they do say
that you never know what goes on


49
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.649
behind the net curtains of suburbia.

50
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.169
Although, in my friend Jay Cartwright's
case, you can have a pretty good guess.

Are you ready to
have some fun, big boy?

53
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.089
Mmm.

54
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.689
I'm feeling sexy!

55
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.729
Take off mask, baby, let me see you.

56
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.569
Nah.

57
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.929
Do you promise this'll be properly filthy,
yeah?


58
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.849
Oh, yes, like bomb explode from in penis.

Christ, you make me so erect.

61
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.529
Oh, yes, you also make me erect.

62
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.569
Now, put in card details.
Oh, I'm so horny.


63
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.449
Don't forget security number and bank.

64
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.969
Mm! Come on, hurry up.

65
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.409
All right, Jay's mum! Where's Jay?

66

Oh, hello, Neil. He's at home,
updating his CV.

Ooh, excuse me.

69
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.249
Hello?

70
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.809
Ohh...

71
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.249
It's a bit over, is that OK?

72
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.369
Not really.

73
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.929
- Excuse me! My prawns?
- Sorry, mate, I finish at six.


74
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.889
Cheers for that.

75
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.089
- You don't have to thank me every time.
- Oh, right. Cool.


76
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.609
You're so fit.

77
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.769
Simon, we need to talk.

78
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.369
Oh, not talking!

79
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.409
- Look, it's been great so far...
- It's been amazing.


80
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.009
Literally the best year of my life.
My spots clearing up, not moving to Wales,


81
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.049
and now you.

82
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.969
And I'm definitely getting better
at kissing, aren't I?


83
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.289
I think we should break up.

84
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.969
What?

85
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.249
We're both going away to uni soon,

86
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.569
and it'll be too hard to keep it going
long-distance.


87
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.529
- It won't be fair on either of us.
- I don't mind.


88
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.129
You will mind, though. You will.

89
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.529
I bloody won't!

90

Plus, I'm going on holiday soon,
so there's that.

Why? What are you planning to do
on holiday?


92

Maybe you should just go home.

93
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.889
I just need some space to think
at the moment.


94

OK, fine. So, I'll see you later, yeah?

95

Oh, yes, I like
you. Oh, I like you.

Get out! I'm just looking at holidays!
It's just holidays!

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.289
Jay, can you come downstairs, please?
Your grandfather's died.


106

Ooh, you've got a
lady there, you bad boy!

107

Has she got nice titties? Suck on
the lady's titties. Suck them, go on!


108
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.569
WILL: It was our
last ever day of school,

109
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.409
something my new stepmum had
experienced only four years ago herself.


110
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.809
So the head of Sixth was going to say
a few inspirational words.


111
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.569
And if ever there was a man for the job,
it wasn't lunatic giant Mr Gilbert.


112
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.889
I will forget each and every one of you
almost immediately.


113
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.489
So, if you do find yourself at a loose end
next year,


114
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.689
and think it might be nice to pop in
and see how we're getting on,


115
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.169
don't. This isn't the Dead Poets Society

116
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.689
and I'm not that bloke on BBC Two
who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs.


117
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.249
I especially don't want to hear about
how well you're settling down at uni


118
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.689
or how much growing up you've done
in the past 12 months.


119
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.369
At best, I am ambivalent
towards most of you,


120
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.609
but some of you, 
I actively dislike,

121
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.769
for no other reason
than your poor personal hygiene


122
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.769
or your irritating personalities.

123
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.289
I hope I've made myself clear
on this point.


124
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.289
And in case any of you think
I'm joking...I'm not.


125
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.929
I assure you that once my legal obligation

126
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.009
to look after your best interests
is removed,


127
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.689
I can be one truly nasty fucker.

128
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.249
Good luck with the rest of your lives
and...try not to kill anyone.


129
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.289
It reflects very badly
on all of us here.

130
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.569
Slightly more upbeat than I was expecting.

131
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.729
WILL: They say your school days
are the best days of your life.


132
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.209
But the only way that
would be true for me

133
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.129
would be if I went straight from school
to prison and stayed there until I died.


134
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.049
How many times is that
she's caught you now?


135
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.969
Four. But this was the worst.

136
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.609
Mask, snorkel, ham.

137
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.209
OK, one last one for luck.

138
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.089
Ooooh!

139
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.929
Good. Old school wedgie.
To be admired, in a way.


140
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.969
Squashing the balls now.
Ooh! That does not tickle!


141
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.409
Argh!

142
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.929
Mark! What the fuck
do you think you're doing? Put him down.


143
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.449
All right, calm down.

144
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.329
Just saying goodbye to Bender Squad.

145
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.249
- Have a nice life, dickheads.
- Oh, grow up! God!


146
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.209
- Are you OK, Will?
- Fine! Slightly chafed arse crack,


147
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.289
- but, no, basically fine, thanks.
- Hi, Simon.


148
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.849
OK, well, bye, then.

149
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.889
Fucking bitch.

150
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.929
Is she?

151
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.649
No.

152
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.329
Oh, God... I just really miss her.

153
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.169
(CRIES)

154
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.009
It's all right, mate. I understand.
Anyone would miss those tits.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.209
- It's not that, Neil.
- Is it her lovely snatch?


156
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.769
- No.
- I know it feels rough


157
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.569
now, Si,
but you just need to give it some time.


158
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.049
I'm just worried I'll never get over her.
(CRIES)


159
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.009
- I can help you with that!
- Can you?


160
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.889
Yeah! From now on, every time
you mention the Moanatronic 5000,


161
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.409
- you get a slap in the balls.
- Do you mean Carli?


162
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.489
Ow! For fuck's sake, Jay!

163
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.489
- NEIL: You were warned.
- How's that helping?!


164
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.489
Stopped you from crying like a baby,
for one.


165
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.409
So my life is still ruined,
but now my balls ache too. Thanks, Jay(!)


166
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.529
No, your life is just about to begin,
mate!


167
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.769
Now you've been dumped, we can all go
on a mental holiday together.


168
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.129
Two weeks of sun, sea, sex, sand, booze,

169
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.169
sex, minge, fanny and tits.

170
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.289
And booze.

171
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.769
And sex!

172
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.849
He's put it horrifically,
but he's probably right.


173
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.329
A holiday would definitely
take your mind off her.


174
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.209
JAY: Plus, it's the perfect time to go.

175
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.729
NEIL: Yeah, they say the summer is
the perfect time for a summer holiday.


176
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.769
WILL: Come on, Si, what do you say?
The lads on tour!


177
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.609
- NEIL: And you.
- WILL: Yes, and me! One of the lads.


178
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.849
Yeah, fuck it, go on, then.
Maybe it will help.


179
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.609
Course it will! And, I promise you, Si,

180
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.009
we'll go somewhere so full of fit birds,
it'll be like shooting clunge in a barrel.


181
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.049
What a lovely image(!)

182
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.529
WILL: So, that was it.
We were no longer schoolboys.


183
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:10.849
And, to prove our independence,

184
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.769
we were off on the holiday of a lifetime
without our parents...


185
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.369
after we'd made them pay for it.

186
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.409
I know this is the first time you've ever
been away from me, but don't go crazy.


187
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.569
When have I ever gone crazy?!

188
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.529
That time you drank all that shandy
at Debra's wedding. You went pretty wild!


189
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.889
- I was seven years old!
- He was running round, his pants down,


190
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.329
shouting, "I've got a white slug!"

191
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.649
- Mum!
- Oh, hello, Kevin!


192
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.249
Looks like just Jay
we're waiting for, then.


193
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.529
Yes, it does "look like" that, doesn't it?
God! Sorry about her.


194
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.929
Are you all right, Neil?
Your face is a bit weird.


195
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.329
Fine! Just popped a bit of my sister's
fake tan on, get it started, you know.


196
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.569
Just on your face?

197
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.849
Well... It's on my hands, now, too.

198
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.609
All right? Who's this, then, the vicar?

199
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.729
Me? No, no, I'm Kevin. I'm Neil's father.
Nice to meet you.


200
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.569
Where's Neil been hiding you, then?
The church? (LAUGHS)


201
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.129
- Looks like a bloody vicar, don't he?
- No, no, I'm not a vicar.


202
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.129
No, I know that. But you look like a vicar
and you talk like a vicar.


203
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.889
A bloody gay vicar, or something! (LAUGHS)

204
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.649
Well, I'm not a
vicar and I'm not gay.

205
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.409
No, I'm saying you lookgay.

206
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.129
But you can't be, can you? Cos old
soppy bollocks here come out your pipe.


207
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.529
Right, I see.

208
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.769
Well, gotta get going.
Don't want you to miss that flight.


209
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.529
Bye-bye, Pookie Petal. 
Love you, mwah!

210
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.929
Oh, and Jay? If you're gonna spend
your grandad's money chasing skirt,


211
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.809
two things. One, make sure she's not
a hound like the last one.


212
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.929
And two, try to be a man when she dumps
you for someone with a bigger cock...


213
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.649
...which is everyone! (LAUGHS)

214
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.569
Dad!

215
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.569
WILL: Dads are like arseholes.
Everyone's got one, yes,


216
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.049
but also, they're arseholes. Which is why
they make excellent cab drivers.


217
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.249
Takes me back, all this -
cheap flights at ungodly hours.


218
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.769
Where is it you're headed to again?
Simon never tells me anything.


219
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.209
- Malia, Mr Cooper, in Greece.
- Can't say I've heard of it.


220
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.809
Of course you haven't,
it's a cool place to go.


221
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.289
And it's got a Subways.

222
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.369
Oh, right. In my day,
it was all about Spain.


223
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.529
Me and my mates went to Magaluf
this one time.


224
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.929
- Shagaluf, we called it!
- (NEIL LAUGHS)


225
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.689
Should've called it Shagalot. And hard.
Anything that moved.


226
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.449
We had a system.

227
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.529
Always left a hat on the bedroom door
when one of us got lucky.


228
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.009
Was usually me.

229
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.129
Oh, Dad, please shut up!

230
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.169
I don't know what it is,

231
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.649
but you'll find girls just seem to let
themselves go a bit more abroad.


232
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.569
It's like as soon as they smell
the sun cream, they get wet.


233
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.649
- Your mother's the same, even now.
- Oh, God, just drop us here!


234
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.729
WILL: I was learning a lot about holidays.

235
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.249
And not just what they did
to Mrs Cooper's front bottom.


236
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.449
I was also learning
that on a lads' holiday,


237
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.849
it's compulsory to wear
"hilarious" matching T-shirts.


238
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.409
Here y'are.

239
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.489
Nice!

240
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.009
Right, you owe me 12 quid each.
Except for you, Will, you owe me 20.


241
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.489
What?! Why?

242
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.289
Cos I had to bung the bloke
a few extra quid for him to make it.


243
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.969
Right, so I've got to pay more money
for a T-shirt I didn't ask for


244
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.289
and I'm not going to wear, cos it carries
a nickname I didn't know I had?


245
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.529
- Yes.
- Great(!)


246
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.089
(LAUGHING)

247
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.569
# Come on, come
on, come on, come on

248
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.409
# Got my peeps standing with me
at the bar doing shots


249
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.249
# Cos now we're so fucking plastered
we don't know when to stop


250
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.209
# I got my peeps standing with me
and I'm having a blast


251
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.089
# I'm feeling so fucking good right now
I want it to last


252
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.689
# I'm at the bar and I see this chick
checking me out


253
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.889
# From afar, yes, she wants my dick
There ain't a doubt


254
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.809
# Now I'm in a lift, getting lips
How dumb is this girl?


255
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.129
# But do I care? Do I fuck!
I'm on a roll! Yo! #


256
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.009
Malia flight?

257
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.129
Yep.

258
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.369
Delay, seven hours.

259
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.889
And please remove those T-shirts,
or we won't allow you to board the plane.


260
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.809
WILL: Despite Neil offering - twice -
they didn't let him drive the plane.


261
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.449
Finally, though, we'd made it on holiday,

262
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.889
and Jay's thoughts on the beautiful isle
of Crete, birthplace of Zeus,


263
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.409
were as insightful as ever.

264
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.369
- I'm hot.
- It is well hot.


265
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.889
- Might be too hot.
- Might be.


266
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.409
- (CAR HORN BLARES)
- Oh!


267
00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.969
Carli! Carli!

268
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.009
Carls!

269
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.009
Oh.

270
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.689
Sorry.

271
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.849
(BUZZ OF CONVERSATION)

272
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.929
Oi, Jay, Jay...

273
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.449
Tidy minge, ten o'clock.

274
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.849
Jay? Jay!

275
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.089
Didn't you see them girls?

276
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.329
Why don't you chirps 'em?

277
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.089
- I can't handle that many at once, Neil.
- Really? What about that netball team?


278
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.329
Yeah, that was all right,
cos that was a luxury caravan.


279
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.849
But this coach is way too small
for my moves.


280
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.329
Ah, course.

281
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.929
Right, so, the plan is
get to the apartment, unpack,


282
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.569
get some sleep,
then head out fresh tomorrow.


283
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.249
First up, the Minoan Palace at Knossos.

284
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.649
JAY: Have you come on a lads' holiday
by mistake?!


285
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.649
We haven't come halfway round the world to
look at some boring fucking Greek ruins.


286
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.569
Yeah, you can see that shit anywhere.

287
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.289
We go there, drop the bags off,
then go straight out and get spasticated.


288
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.489
Simples.

289
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.209
But I've not slept for 37 hours.

290
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.289
Shut up and try and get
some sleep on here, then.


291
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.049
Fine, good idea.

292
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.729
- (ENGINE STARTS)
- # We love you Burnley, we do

# We love you Burnley, we do

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.609
# We love you Burnley, we do
Oh, Burnley, we love you!

I can't hear a fucking thing... #


298

football, I say yes. I do like football.


299
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.369
But not Burnley.

300
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.369
Burnley can fuck off.

301
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.889
# Come on, Burnley! #

302
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.089
# Oh, Burn-a-ley is wonderful! #

303
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.009
WILL: It was a tense moment.

304
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.769
Someone was obviously staying here.

305
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.809
Right, then, McKenzie party.
This is you.


306

(BURNLEY FANS CHEERING)

307
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.289
Good one, fellas! Don't worry,
it'll look nice when it's finished.


308
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.969
- # Oh, Burn-a-ley!
- # Oh, Burn-a-ley! #


309
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.129
# Is wonderful... #

310
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.609
This don't look like the pictures.

311
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.729
WILL: I still don't
know how the dog died.

312
00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.969
I can only presume it threw itself
in the well, rather than stay here.


313
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.049
You Willy?

314
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.489
Yes.

315
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.689
Your key. You have fun.

316
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.209
But not too much fun.

317
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.289
You shit on floor - 50 euro fine.

318
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.449
Each time!

319
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.529
All right, lads!

320
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.809
- Are you stopping here?
- Yes. We are.


321
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.689
Bad luck. I've just come back
from Afghanistan,


322
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.769
and conditions there
are better than this shithole.


323
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.049
I can't wait to get back to lying
in a dusty trench,


324
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.609
being shot at by some raghead.
Are you married?


325
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.729
- No.
- Don't get married.


326
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.849
The wife booked this, but somehow,
it's my fucking fault.


327
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.689
Anyway, pop down for a beer if you fancy.
I'll see youse later.


328
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.089
Hey!

329
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.369
You owe me 50 euros!

330
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.649
WILL: As we entered our new home,
wondering


331
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.249
if our human rights
had been breached,


332
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.129
I couldn't help thinking
a shit on the floor


333
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.529
might have
cheered the place up a bit.


334
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.849
- JAY AND NEIL: Shotgun this room!
- Shotgun the sofa bed!


335
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.169
Well, where am I gonna sleep then?!

336
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.809
Not really my problem.

337
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.769
What's that? Is that the bath?

338
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.129
Course it's not the bath,
you fucking idiot. There's the bath!


339
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.769
That's the...kids' toilet.

340
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:17.969
- Is it?
- Yes!


341
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.889
Why's it got a
plughole and a tap, then?

342
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.129
Cos it's for checking your kid's shit
before you flush it.


343
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.849
- Urgh, that's grim!
- Yeah, I know.


344
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.089
That's the Continentals, innit?
They're dirty.


345
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.209
See? That looks nice!

346
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.889
I'm not sleeping in a fucking bathtub
for two weeks, Simon!


347
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.249
We'll have to share the sofa bed.

348

(HIGH
-PITCHED) Ooh, 'ello!

349
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.289
Right, well, while you two decide
who gets first go on each other's cocks,


350
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.729
I'm getting ready and getting out there.

351
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.329
The gash isn't gonna fuck itself,
you know.

(JAY SCREAMS)

354
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:19.369
WILL: Finally, smelling like an industrial
accident at the Lynx factory,


355
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.809
and looking like the world's
shittest boy band, we hit the town.


356
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.849
- Ooh, heads down, boys.
- NEIL: Shit.


357
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.729
What? Why? We haven't done anything!

358
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.769
- Foreign police, innit?
- So?


359
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.329
Don't you even know about foreign police?

360
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.249
What, short-sleeved uniforms?
Chunkier truncheons?


361
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.889
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Mate, they're all corrupt.


362
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.329
Basically, if you misbehave
and don't have the money to bribe 'em,


363
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.889
they take you up
to these shepherds' huts in the hills


364
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.649
beat you up and bum ya.

365
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.369
And if they don't kill ya,
you kill yourself,


366
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.729
cos of the shame of getting a boner
whilst you was being bummed.


367
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.609
Right, couple of things. Firstly,
the hills here are full of timeshares,


368
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.929
not deserted shepherds' huts.

369
00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.889
Secondly, Crete's in the EU,
so I think the standard of policing


370
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.969
probably goes beyond bumming
and forced suicide.


371
00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.089
Believe what you want. I'm keeping
a bribe up my arse just in case.


372
00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.329
You're gonna spend the whole holiday with

373
00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.689
It's been up there since
the seatbelt signs went off, mate.


374
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.489
All right, lads! Holiday, is it? I'm out
here on my own, having a mental time!


375
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.289
Can I have a beer?

376
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.369
- Oh, here you go, mate.
- No, you can't!


377

All right, which is it?
You say yes, he says bloody no.


378
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.529
- He's not your boss, is he? Eh?
- Sorry... Do we know you?


379
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.489
Anyways, here's a good one for you, right.

380
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.249
Get a torch and walk along the beach at
night and you get to watch people fucking.


381
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.209
They're all drunk and you get to see
tits and cocks and that.


382
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.729
If you're into cocks.
Which it looks like he is! Ha-ha!

Well, it's been great talking to you,
but we've really got to get a move on.

Can I come round yours for a shower?

385
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.209
Um, no.

386
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.649
No? Cool beans. 
See you later, lads!

everywhere,


397
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.569

- She'd get it.


398
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.249
NEIL: Most definitely!

399
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.689
Oh, and that one. She'd get it!

400
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.049
- And that one! And that one.
- And that one. She'd get it.


401
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.409
Right in the bumholey.

402
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.529
I can't believe I've already got a bird.
Gutted.


403
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:53.049
So fucking what?! All birds know -
what goes on tour stays on tour.


404
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.409
No, I couldn't do that to Nicole.
I think I love her.


405
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.409
And I never loved anything before
apart from a car or a sandwich.


406
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.929
If the build-up gets too much for you, you
can always borrow one of my johnnies,


407
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.489
have a wank royale.

408
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.169
- Oh, cheers, Jay!
- A what?!


409
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.609
A wank royale. A wank with a johnny on.
It's a bit more expensive,


410
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.209
so I tend to save it
for special occasions.


411
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.089
Birthdays, Christmas,
the Champions League final...


412
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.089
All right, lads!
Are you up for a good time?


413
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.489
Yeah, we're always up for a good time.

414
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.849
We're the Pussay Patrol.

415
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.409
All right. Well, if you really are
the Pussay Patrol...


416
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.209
- Which we are.
- You're obviously going to Marco's.


417
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.449
It's the most buzzing bar out here. Always
packed with a chilled-out, sexy vibe.


418
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.649
- Know what I mean?
- I don't really know what you mean.


419
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.889
When you say "sexy vibe",
do you mean girls?


420
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.009
Course! Loads of girls.

421
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.329
I'll sort you out half-price drinks
and a free fishbowl.


422
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.849
Cool, cool, cool.

423
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.049
So, will you be in there,
with your sexiness,


424
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.809
making the vibe all...sexy?
Being all sexy, and that, sexy?


425
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.249
Say "sexy" more.

426
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.529
Well, I will be if you're gonna be there,
you saucy bugger!


427
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.729
Come on, then!

428
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.369
Here you go, these four. I'll see you
in a bit. Mine's a Bacardi and Coke.


429
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.569
Large one?

430
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.849
Saucy! See you later.

431
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.489
Fucking hell, you're well in there, mate!

432
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.169
Yep! He shoots, he scores.
Right up the vag.


433
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.489
Oh, my God, if she's outside,
imagine the birds inside!


434
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.209
Ah. Interesting.

435
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.089
Well, it must get going a bit later.
She did say it was amazing.


436
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.249
And why would she lie?!

437
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.809
All right, mate. Four pints, four
Jgermeisters and a fishbowl, please.


438
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.969
Hello.

439
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.049
- When it good here?
- Sorry?


440
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.049
Er, when here party good?

441
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.289
Normally about an hour or two?

442
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.529
Oh. Well, as we've paid,
maybe we should hang on, then?


443
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.009
But this year...never.

444
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.049
Thanking you, very much.

445
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.089
OK, let's go.

446
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.809
Fuck off! My bird'll
be down in a minute.

on commission to trick people

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:44.929
into this empty bar?

449
00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.649
No, I mean the little hottie outside
that I was flirting with.


450
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.729
I'll take that as a yes, then.

451
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.409
I'm going nowhere
till she's sucked me off!


452
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.049
- So, you're going nowhere.
- WILL: Jay, we're on holiday!


453
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.769
I'm meant to be out there, trying to
hit on girls that I think are beneath me,


454
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.369
but who, for their part, won't give me
the time of day! So, let's go!


455
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.129
Ooh! Hello, hello!
It's those little lovelies from the coach!


456
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.329
- That one's not so little.
- I think they're looking at us.


457
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.929
And not in a weird, terrified,
"leave us alone" way. Amazing!


458
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.409
Jay, you're drunkest.
Go over and talk to them.


459
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.369
Nah, not me, mate.
None of them are as fit as my one outside.


460
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.089
Why go for hamburgers,
when you've got steak at home?


461
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.849
If, like you, you have neither anywhere.

462
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.369
It's up to you, then, Si.

463
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.849
Shit, really?
I don't know if I'm over Carli.


464
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.369
Ow! Fuck! Can you stop that?!

465
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.489
Yes, I can. When you stop being
such a pussy about your ex.


466
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.609
It's time to get back
on the horse now, Si.


467
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.289
And those little ponies need feeding.

468
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.089
Feed the pony.

469
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.289
Yeah, OK, I'll introduce us,
but we've all got to go over together.


470
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.769
- Great.
- You fucking sad cases.


471
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.609
You don't just walk up to a girl in a club
and introduce yourself! That's creepy.


472
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.369
Clubs are different rules, you dick.

473
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.169
Look, you dance over near them, make
the eyes, then get 'em to dance with you.


474
00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.289
Really?!

475
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.569
- Annoyingly, that does sound right.
- Thank you!


476
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.649
And then, after a bit,
you stand up behind them,


477
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.609
pretend to slap 'em
and fuck 'em up the arse.


478
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.529
- That might be a bit much.
- Yeah, I dunno...


479
00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.369
Oh, fucking hell, I'll do it.

480
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.689
- What about Nicole?
- It's only dancing, she likes my dancing.


481
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.369
Stick with me, you'll be fine.

482
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.969
Right, then, Si.
Looks like the holiday starts here.


483
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.049
(# YOLANDA BE COOL:
We No Speak Americano)


484
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.889
Am I doing it
right? Am I in time?

485
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.769
Maybe a bit out, but not so you'd notice.
Copy Neil.


486
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.849
Sorry. Do you mind
if we come and talk to you?


487
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.849
Cos you look nice and, frankly, this is
just humiliating for everyone involved.


488
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.969
Um...

489
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.969
Sit down, Specs.

490
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.729
Hello. I'm Lucy.

491
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.209
Hi, I'm Diamond... Simon! I'm Simon.

492
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.209
I'd better not get
stuck with the fat one.

493
00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.889
So, when Alison initially suggested Malia,
we all thought, yeah, why not?


494
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.129
It'll be ironic.
Then we had a reality check


495
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.889
and we thought, do we honestly wanna spend
two weeks somewhere being ironic,


496
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.809
and obviously the answer was no,
so then we looked at other places,


497
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.889
but we realised, actually, we just want to
have a laugh and go clubbing and get drunk


498
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.209
and be silly, and that this might
genuinely be a good place to come,


499
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.449
so fuck it, here we are.

500
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.889
Just so you know, I've met a really
fit bird and she'll be along any minute.


501
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.569
OK. She won't mind you talking to me,
then, will she?


502
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.169
WILL: If our dancing was bad -
and it was bad...


503
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.849
then our small talk was even worse.

504
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.969
Sorry, will you excuse us a moment?

505
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.449
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?!


506
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.409
What do you think I mean?!
Why aren't you talking to the girls?


507
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.249
I get, like, words making sounds
in my head, but they don't come out.


508
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.889
Well, that's easy to fix. Just say them!
Move your mouth and say them!


509
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.009
Well, I can't pork any of them anyways,
cos of Nicole.


510
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.649
But it would be
nice to make a connection,

511
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.129
like on them TV shows,
when people make a connection.


512
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.129
Oh, this is hopeless.

513
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.649
Well, I don't exactly see you
charming your way into their knickers.


514
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.329
I just danced for the first time
in my life!


515
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.489
It's hard to know
what to follow up with.

516
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.169
Maybe you could pretend to not have
the personality you've got.


517
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.289
Like...pretend to be someone cool.

518
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.209
Thanks, Simon. Thank you. Big help(!)

519
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.769
Yeah. Actually,
it's probably best you don't even try.


520
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.769
No, I am going to try.
If anything, I'm gonna try too hard.


521
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.089
She is well out of your league.

522
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.289
Like well, well, well out of your league.

523
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.409
So? All girls I like
are out of my league.

524
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.209
What's the point of going for girls
in my league?


525
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.089
Look at me! Imagine my league!

526
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.249
Oh, God.

527
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.329
Er, Jay, mate?
I think you missed the toilet.


528
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.889
Are you saying I can't hold my drink?

529
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.409
You are pissing your drink
all over the floor.


530
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.969
So? It's still the toilet.
This whole room's the toilet.


531
00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.849
Neil? Can you chuck me a paper towel?

532
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.889
Ah! Wipe the drip from my knob.

533
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.729
Birds don't like it when it tastes pissy.

534
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:40.529
OK, come on, guys. We've done
the hard bit. Let's not fuck this up.


535
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.009
I just can't think of what to say!

536
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.569
Just talk about something you love.
Something you're passionate about.


537
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:49.009
Right. Oh, cool. Got it.
I know exactly what to say.


538
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.049
It's pretty devastating,

539
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.009
cos she's definitely
the most beautiful girl I've ever met.


540
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.889
She's so fascinating.
She's really funny, you know?


541
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.409
Oh, right. In what sort of way?

542
00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.449
Just like... You know when something's
funny and people get it?


543
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.809
Yes.

544
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.729
So, in that way.
And, also, in a comedy way.


545
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.969
WILL: Neil was a man of few words,
but even for him, this was ridiculous.


546
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.489
Not that I was faring
that much better myself.


547
00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.929
So, do this place hire you out as
some sort of avant-garde dance troupe


548
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.289
to scare the customers off?

549
00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.289
No. I lost my mind and agreed to come here
on holiday. What's your excuse?


550
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.689
Sort of similar.

551
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.409
I came out here earlier this summer and
fell crazy in love with a gorgeous local,


552
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.089
- so now I'm back.
- Hilarious. Course you did.


553
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.489
What was he, a barman or a waiter?

554
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.849
- Waiter.
- Brilliant. Was he called Stavros?


555
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.809
- Nicos.
- Too good.


556
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.049
I bet he's different to all the boys
back home!


557
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.489
Yeah. He understands women, for one.

558
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.209
I'm sure he does.
Must get enough practice.


559
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.649
WILL: Not only had Jay not offered
to buy Jane a drink,


560
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.889
he'd now stopped paying for his own.

561
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.089
Meanwhile, Simon was on a roll.

562
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:51.209
So then Carli said we needed some space.
And uni's coming up,


563
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.969
- so maybe she's right.
- Sorry, who's right?


564
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.089
- Carli?
- Who?


565
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.129
Carli, my ex?

566
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.729
You went out with a girl called Carli?
You should've said(!)


567
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.609
What? I did!
That's all I've been talking about.


568
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.649
Oh!

569
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.689
Yes, I was joking!

570
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.809
Sorry for going on about her. I usually
get a smack in the balls to stop me.


571
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:10.969
What?!

572
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.249
Um, nothing.

573
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.809
WILL: Meanwhile,
Neil had a trump card to play.


574
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.009
Do you want to dance?

575
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.729
WILL: Meanwhile,
Alison didn't seem to be enjoying


576
00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.369
my hilarious Greek waiter impression.

577
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.769
So, I presume he wooed you with the old,
"Hh'I love you, hh'I love you!


578
00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:39.849
"You hh'only girl for me!
There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!


579
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.369
"Oh, wait, here comes the next plane
from Newcastle. I've gotta go, baby."


580
00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.089
Sorry, you do realise
I'm not playing along with the joke.


581
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.889
I do genuinely have a Greek waiter
boyfriend called Nicos.


582
00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.249
No, of course you do.

583
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.969
Brilliant. Nicos.
You've really nailed the clichs.


584
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.409
- You are joking, aren't you?
- No.


585
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.009
His grandmother has a moustache as well,
if that makes the stereotype even funnier.


586
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.249
I'm sorry. I'm sure he's not like
every other waiter out here.


587
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.049
It's fine. You don't know
what you're talking about.


588
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.169
Your accent was pretty good, though.

589
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.449
Oh, I've gotta go. Don't want to miss
my stereotypical Greek boyfriend.


590
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.809
He might get angry and smash some plates.

591
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.929
Or commit atrocities in Anatolia.

592
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.449
You're not normal, are you?

593
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.649
You all right, Lise?
Where's that bloke you were dancing with?


594
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:36.449
# I've got nothing but love for you

595
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.409
# I've got nothing
but love for you... #

596
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.129
Luce, we should go. Nicos finishes soon,
and I don't want to miss him.


597
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.049
So, shall we all hang out again sometime?

598
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.929
Yeah. You lot don't seem too bad.

599
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.689
If I hear another bloke out here
refer to women as "gash", I'll scream.


600
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.809
- Yeah. No, that is horrible. Really bad.
- It's awful when men do that. Disgusting.


601
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.609
Do you fancy coming to the all-day
boat party, Friday?


602
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:02.969
I know it's meant to be sold out, but
our rep reckons he can still get tickets.


603
00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:04.689
All-day boat party - what's that?

604
00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.369
Well, it's a party.

605
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:08.569
OK.

606
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.489
- All day.
- Yep.


607
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.089
- On a boat.
- Oh, right.


608
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:18.049
Well! Now that's been cleared up,
we should go.


609
00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.649
See you later, Will.

610
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.729
Amazing.

611
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.809
Do you realise, we just danced over,
chatted up some girls,


612
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.489
they loved it and
you didn't fuck it up!

613
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.129
- Me?!
- Are we players?


614
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:33.049
I'm starting to think that here, unlike
at home, we might actually be players.


615
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.889
Maybe. I'm not really sure
what that means.


616
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.369
However, cos I've not slept now
for two days, I'm going to bed.


617
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:39.769
Yeah. My eyeballs feel like
they've got paper cuts.


618
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.249
- Jay, are you coming?
- Fuck that!


619
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.089
There's a fit bird up there
who's so wet for me,


620
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.769
I can hear the waves breaking
in her fanny.


621
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.889
I'm gonna down this, then take her down
the beach and fuck her brains out.


622
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.329
Right, well, we've established
that isn't happening.


623
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.249
Fine. Watch me.

624
00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:57.889
Mm. Classy(!)

625
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.729
We'd better get Neil.

626
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:05.249
- Neil...?
- Oh, God! We're off.


627
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:06.849
Right. Won't be a minute,
I'll just finish up here.


628
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.609
Christ, Neil, what about Nicole?

629
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.249
Oh, she won't mind, we're not kissing.

630
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.049
Nah. It's just fingers, in't it, lover?

631
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.409
Right.

632
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.249
Yeah. I'll catch you lot up. One second.

633
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.089
He's definitely picked up the pace.

634
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.129
WILL: While Neil picked up
his finger-banging speed,


635
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.289
we picked up Jay - and he had
a chilling prediction to share with us.


636
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.929
She's gonna suck my knob-knob dry.
You watch.


637
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.129
I'd rather not watch,
if it's all the same to you.


638
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.529
Shit, is that Carli?

639
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.969
Look, Si, it's normal
that after a break-up,


640
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.049
you'll think you see her everywhere,
but she's not here.


641
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.529
Yeah. I suppose.

642
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.449
- Could be her.
- What?


643
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:42.289
Could be her.
She is out here at the moment.


644
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.489
What?!

645
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.609
Well, we weren't sure where
the best place to go was,


646
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.089
and her and her mates are pretty cool,
so I asked them where they was going


647
00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.409
and when, and that's why I booked Malia.

648
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.849
You fucking idiot!
I came away to try and get over her!


649
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.769
- Did ya?
- You know I did!


650
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.249
Oh, yeah, course.

651
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.689
Oh, God, look at her.

652
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.929
Do you think this is fate?
Her being here, me being here.


653
00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.529
No. I think Neil asked her
where she was going


654
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.289
and then booked the same place,
like he just said.


655
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.769
Let's go before she sees us!

656
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.209
No, no. I've got to
go and talk to her.

657
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.889
If there's even the slightest chance
of us getting back together,


658
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.009
I've got to take it.

659
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:14.529
Carli!

660
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:15.649
Carli?

661
00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:16.689
Simon?!

662
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.169
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

663
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:19.689
Stalking you abroad.

664
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.129
No. The opposite, actually.
Just a mix-up by my friends.


665
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.289
My stupid fucking idiot friends.

666
00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.089
Well, whatever. 
It's great to see you.

667
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.289
Is it?!

668
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.649
Yeah, it is. Course.

669
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.769
Course.

670
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:34.209
So, as we're here, why don't we hang out?
How about right now?


671
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.729
Now? Oh, I can't now. But you'll be
at the boat party on Friday, right?


672
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.249
The boat party? I was literally
just talking about the boat party.


673
00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.449
It's gonna be amazing. The best way
to round off our holiday.


674
00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.209
What? Why are you going? Don't go.

675
00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.129
I've got to go.
My flight leaves on Saturday.


676
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.009
The boat's our last chance to party.

677
00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.129
Right. Well, I'll definitely be there,
then.


678
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.009
For total, one million per cent.
Definitely.


679
00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.929
Cool. It'll be great to hang out again.

680
00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.329
- I've missed you.
- Hmm?


681
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.929
Argh, Jesus!

682
00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.169
- Fuck it!
- Sorry, mate.


683
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:06.169
- James! Are you all right, Simon?
- (WHIMPERS) Yeah, fine. Argh!


684
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.929
I'll walk it off.

685
00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.129
Cool, yeah. Carls, come on,
we've gotta go.


686
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.489
Oh, do you two know each other?

687
00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:12.649
Yeah, James is our rep.

688
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.809
Rep, unofficial rep. I sort out club
nights. A bit of party organising, PR...


689
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.249
Just make sure everyone's having
a good time, you know what I mean?


690
00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.809
- Are you sure you're all right, mate?
- All good...


691
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.929
Cool. Carls, come on.

692
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.329
Bye, Simon. See you on the boat.

693
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.049
See you, mate. 
Mind that leg.

694
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.489
I'll sort you out a free fishbowl.

695
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:38.769
Oi, baby, you stood me up!

696
00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.889
Ah, didn't wait long enough, sweetheart.

697
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.249
Come on, kiss me.

698
00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:43.529
I'm working, darling.

699
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.329
I love your boobs.

700
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.489
What?!

701
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.369
What gives you the right to touch me,
you fucking prick?


702
00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:49.409
Wha...?

703
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.409
Sorry, I think he might've had
a little too much of the old drink.


704
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.329
I am sick of every dickhead
thinking he's got touching rights,


705
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.889
just cos I smiled at him.
It's my fucking job, you cretin!


706
00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.049
Are you on the blob?

707
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.889
Sexy. I like it.

708
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.089
- No, Jay. Time for bed.
- Fuck that!


709
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.489
You two can bum yourselves to death
on the sofa bed.


710
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.569
I'm going to get another drink.

711
00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.489
Jay, don't be insane.
You're too drunk already.


712
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.409
I'm on fucking holiday.
You can't be too drunk!


713
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.169
- You coming, Neil?
- Nah, I like it in there.


714
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.809
And not sleeping for two nights is pretty
much the same as not sleeping for one.


715
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:23.929
Right, fine. Fucking knobheads.

716
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:25.929
How was your chat?

717
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:29.689
Amazing. Carli is here, Will. That's what
she was worried about, us being apart.


718
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.409
That's why we split up.

719
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:32.929
But we're not apart,
because we're both here.


720
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.449
I just need to get on that boat.

721
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.369
Actually, can one of youse help me?
I think she might be a two-man job.


722
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.609
What happened to your leg?

723
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.009
- Oh, I got a little bit run over.
- "A little bit run over"?!


724
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.329
(WHOOPING)

725
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:54.609
WILL: The next morning, 
I was woken up

726
00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:58.289
by what sounded like
Bigfoot having an asthma attack.


727
00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.729
(WHOOPING)

728
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.849
Simon...

729
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.449
Simon!

730
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.929
Christ, it's like a sauna in here.

731
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.689
Have you got any water?

732
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.209
(WHOOPING CONTINUES)

733
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.049
What the fuck is that noise?

734
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:12.609
I think it's Neil.

735
00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.009
Oh, no, not the dinner lady
from last night!


736
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.449
NEIL: I cannot understand a thing you say.

737
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.609
WOMAN: Spunk all over me bastard tits.

738
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.049
Well, it's her or Johnny Vegas.

739
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.849
WOMAN: Fucking smack it!
Smack it, you little prick!


740
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.129
- WOMAN: Is that all you've got?
- NEIL: Shall I bite it?


741
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.169
Interesting question.

742
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.009
This is beyond creepy.

743
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.889
WOMAN: Twist it right fookin' off!

744
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.529
OK, I'm getting out of here!

745
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.409
WOMAN: Harder!

746
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.049
How can I have spent 100 euros?

747
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.929
Holy shit, I only
budgeted 15 euros a day!

748
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.809
Great, so I spunked all my money

749
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.169
- in one night.
- All right!


750
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.209
Oh, Jesus, Neil!

751
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.529
Oh, don't worry about that.
It's on the way down. Have you seen Jay?


752
00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:51.849
Shit, no. Not since last night.

753
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.209
No, I mean, have you seen him?
He's over there.


754
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.609
(GROANS)

755
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.449
WILL: So Jay had slept
face down in the dirt.


756
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.849
But I'd woken up listening to Neil
getting sucked off.


757
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.009
As far as I was concerned, he won.

758
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.969
Urgh, ohhh!

759
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.649
Face...!

760
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.289
Yeah, you've got something on your face.

761
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.929
It appears Jay's slept in an ants' nest.

762
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.649
Argh! Pain!

763
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.689
Tongue...

764
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.969
It's all right, boys. Kitty don't bite.
Not now she's been fed.


765
00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:37.049
Hey, lover?

766
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:44.409
What the fuck was that?!

767
00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.649
WILL: I'll tell you what does bite,
though. Ants.


768
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.489
...86, 87, 88.

769
00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.809
88 fucking bites.

770
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.889
Ooh, sorry. I asked for two poached eggs?

771
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.409
Is poached, look.

772
00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.089
No, this is fried. 
And "an egg", singular.

773
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.769
Yes, poached. I promise with all my heart.

774
00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:07.049
So, you're promising me, with all
your heart, that this is two poached eggs?


775
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.769
Yes. Burger?

776
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.449
Oh, that's mine.

777
00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.649
Oi, I'm starving!
Where's my bacon sandwich?


778
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.329
I thought you'd have eaten enough pig
last night...


779
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.369
- Mate, what were you thinking?!
- I dunno.


780
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.209
She was saying all this dirty stuff
and she looked a bit like Will's mum.


781
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.209
- So I thought, why not?
- She did not look like my mum, Neil.


782
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.409
- She did a bit.
- No, she did not.


783
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.289
Bet she did when she had his cock
in her mouth.


784
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:28.409
- Brilliant(!)
- Don't you feel bad about Nicole?


785
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.009
- Who?
- The girlfriend you just cheated on?


786
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.289
Oh, no, no, cos
only the tip went in.

787
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:36.489
Any more than the tip is cheating, and I
would never do that, cos I've got ethics.


788
00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.569
- Right... Well, see you lot later.
- Where are you going?


789
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.689
I'm going to find those girls.
They should be at the hotel.


790
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.609
Lucy said her rep could still get
boat party tickets.


791
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.649
Oh, wow. That's an interesting story(!)

792
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:49.449
Well, it is, actually, because guess
who's going to be there - Carli.


793
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:50.569
Ow!

794
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:54.129
Look, she invited me to the party.
She said she missed me.


795
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.689
There's got to be a chance she's...

796
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.009
On all fours, sucking that bloke off?

797
00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.569
No, she wants us to get back together.
What bloke?


798
00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.689
Look, you're meant to be here
to forget about Carli.


799
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:02.969
Argh!

800
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.289
- Not me, Neil!
- I'll help you find them, Si.


801
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:08.129
They were fun. It'll be good
to see them again. Alison was nice.


802
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:12.129
Fine, fuck it. I'll help.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.


803
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.409
Probably spot the lard arse
I got stuck with from outer space.


804
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.249
- Neil?
- Can't,


805
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.729
had a nightmare.
I left my trunks in England.


806
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.969
Just wear your Calvins, mate.
They're practically the same.


807
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.649
- Can I, Will?
- Um, yeah, I suppose.


808
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.729
- And can I bring a ball?
- Yes, Neil. Yes, you can.


809
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.409
WILL: Unsurprisingly, the girls' hotel
was nicer than our hotel.


810
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.769
There are North Korean prison camps
which are nicer than our hotel.


811
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:38.169
But, like a North Korean prison camp, it
was overcrowded, so we had nowhere to sit.


812
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.609
- What about there?
- They've got towels on them, Neil.


813
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:42.769
- So?
- That means people have bagsied them.


814
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.569
- We can't take those.
- Fuck that!


815
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.609
- No, Jay, we can't!
- Watch me!


816
00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:48.969
It's probably just a load of Krauts

817
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.849
that got down early in the morning
to reserve 'em.


818
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.569
That towel's got Finding Nemo on it.

819
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.849
What, so Nazis can't like Disney too?

820
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.209
- Jay!
- Besides, I really need a lie down.


821
00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.489
My head's more fucked
than Neil's dad's arsehole.


822
00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:02.849
Jay, please!

823
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.609
WILL: Jay and Neil were off to,

824
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.049
as they put it,
"check out the chicas".


825
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.769
But I had a serious problem.

826
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.049
In the absence of
my mother, or a teacher,

827
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.809
I needed help with my sunblock.

828
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.129
Simon, will you do my back?

829
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.969
- No.
- No?!


830
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.929
- I don't want to touch you.
- Unbelievable.


831
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.409
Fine, I'll do it myself.

832
00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:28.889
Look all right,
I'll do it with one finger.


833
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.609
Thank you.

834
00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:35.329
You've got too much here.
And here. I'll scrape it off.


835
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.129
OK, but don't try and be funny and draw
a cock on my back or something.


836
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.529
No, course not.

837
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:43.329
Right, all done.

838
00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:45.529
See, that wasn't so bad, was it?

839
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.849
No, that was fine.

840
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:50.089
WILL: I was really enjoying my book,

841
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:53.689
blissfully unaware of the crudely drawn
phallus burning itself onto my skin.


842
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.769
Meanwhile, Jay was having trouble
with his emergency funds.


843
00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.769
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, it's just that 20 euros.


844
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.089
Ay-oh, Jay, here we go,
we've been spotted.


845
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.449
Seen 'em.

846
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.609
Look cool.

847
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.289
(LAUGHS) Manchester.

848
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.329
Manchester!

849
00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.569
- Who's this little twat?
- You from Manchester?


850
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:19.649
You like Manchester?

851
00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.849
- Yeah, yeah. Near Manchester.
- No, you aren't.


852
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:23.929
Shut up, Neil,
the birds are loving it.


853
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.929
- Goal!
- (LAUGHS) Goal!


854
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.449
Goal to Manchester! Yeah!

855
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:31.809
No. Manchester, down.

856
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.129
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

857
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.129
Yeah, hilarious.
Now, get out the way.


858
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.249
Whoa!

859
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.849
(LAUGHTER)

860
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.329
Right. You're fucking dead,
you little shit!


861
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.889
Mate, just leave it,
the chicas are looking, just laugh it off.


862
00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.609
(FORCED LAUGHING)

863
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.129
No, I'm fine for drinks, thanks.

864
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.329
(CLEARS THROAT)

865
00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.609
Oh! Alison. Hello!

866
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.929
Hello. You know you've got
a spunking cock on your back?


867
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.489
What?

868
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.169
Oh, no. Thanks, Simon,

869
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.489
very funny, very mature. So I've been
lying here with a cock on my back, have I?


870
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.129
Not for the first time.

871
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.649
I'll burn a muff on my tit if it makes
you feel less self-conscious.


872
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:33.169
It would, actually.
We'd make quite the pair.


873
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.169
You've got a really good spot here.

874
00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.889
Yes, Jay, um...sort of, um...

875
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.769
Did he use some of his boyish charm?

876
00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.249
In a way, yes.

877
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:43.289
I think I might start drinking again.
Anyone fancy joining me?


878
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.689
Um, yes, I will!

879
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:45.929
Oh.

880
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.489
Lucky me(!)

881
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.409
Oh, I'm knackered.

882
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.609
- Fishbowl hangover?
- No. Nicos was over last night.


883
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.449
Does not stop talking.

884
00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.129
No, we were having sex.

885
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.969
Right.

886
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:03.969
Sorry, does it make you uncomfortable
when I mention sex?


887
00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.529
No! No, it's good,
it's great that you're so...


888
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.009
sexually active.

889
00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.769
Yeah, I suppose it is.

890
00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:16.089
- What's the best sex you've had, Will?
- Well, um...hard to say, really.


891
00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.409
Come on, you can tell me.

892
00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.489
Oh! I don't like to sex and tell.

893
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.329
Don't be boring, just tell me.

894
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.329
Look, I'm going to level with you,

895
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:27.249
I have never...put my penis in a lady.

896
00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.409
That's all right, you're a virgin,
that's cool.


897
00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.009
It's definitely not cool.
If anything, it's famously uncool.


898
00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.089
Well, it's cute, then.

899
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.609
Oh, God, that's even worse.

900
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.289
- You're funny, Will.
- Well, that's something.


901
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:39.249
Can I get a girl into bed for sex
just by making her laugh?


902
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.449
Course you can.

903
00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.289
Wow! Great.

904
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.289
If she's a clinical moron.

905
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.929
Lucy, it's so amazing to see you.

906
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.409
What a welcome.
Nice to see you too.


907
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.489
Yeah. Good. Now, can you
still get boat party tickets?


908
00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:55.209
I'd have thought so,
I'd just have to go and find the rep.


909
00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:56.489
So are you coming along, then?

910
00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:58.169
Yeah, course. It'll be amazing.

911
00:42:58.290 --> 00:42:59.209
Great.

912
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:01.169
Cos Carli's here. In Malia.

913
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.369
And she's going to be
on the boat tomorrow.


914
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.569
If I can just get five minutes
alone with her,


915
00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.409
I know we'll fix things up, it's fate.

916
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.289
So, can you go and get those tickets?

917
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.649
You really know how
to make a girl feel special, don't you?


918
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.449
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

919
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:14.809
Carli is going to love it.

920
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:15.929
Can you hurry up?

921
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:20.649
WILL: Simon's plan was coming together.

922
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:24.369
Meanwhile, Jane was about to experience
the full force of Jay's boyish charm.


923
00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.889
Can you move? You're blocking the sun.

924
00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.249
Charming!

925
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.049
What's happened to your face, Jay?

926
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.289
It's a food allergy.

927
00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:34.129
I could do with one of those,
maybe an iced-bun allergy.


928
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.689
Yeah. You could.

929
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.769
Meanwhile, Neil had
a surprise in store for Lisa.


930
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.609
Forgot my trunks.

931
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.889
Fancy a swim?

932
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:50.489
Oh, leave it out, you little prick.

933
00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.769
Right, that's it!
I'm going to fucking kill ya,


934
00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:58.489
- I'm going to fucking kill ya!
- Oi!


935
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.009
Those are our sunbeds.
And where's our towels?


936
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.689
Oh, good.

937
00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:03.569
Well, there weren't any towels
when we arrived


938
00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:04.809
and we've been here for the last hour.

939
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.169
I didn't ask to read your fucking diary,
love. I said, "Where's our towels?"


940
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:08.929
Now, there's no need to be abusive.

941
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.529
If you look around,
there are signs everywhere


942
00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:11.769
saying you can't reserve sunbeds.

943
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:13.249
So you moved our towels?

944
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:16.289
The point I'm making is,
whatever the fate of the towels,


945
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:17.689
these cannot be your beds.

946
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:19.489
What have you done
with my fucking towels?!


947
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.929
Sir, I get you nice other beds, please,
take up your stuff.


948
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.569
Me?! What?

949
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:24.649
Why should we move?

950
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:25.769
Because he's made a scene?

951
00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:28.209
Because his family are too lazy
to walk 20 feet to the pool?


952
00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:29.329
Seriously, mate, 
I am warning you.

953
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:30.849
Why have a rule
if you aren't going to enforce it?


954
00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.849
The signs are redundant.

955
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:33.969
(WHIMPERING)

956
00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.809
My towel! (CRIES)

957
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.209
Disabled. Course she is.

958
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:39.249
Here you go.

959
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:40.969
- Happy now?
- Well, obviously not.


960
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.889
(SCREECHES)

961
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.489
And that isn't helping.

962
00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:47.329
You lot have got five seconds
to get off my sunbeds.


963
00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.809
Right, come on, Will,
we'll just find somewhere else.


964
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:50.249
But I still don't see
why we should move.


965
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.209
Yes, his daughter
has a serious condition,


966
00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.929
but it's not like the whole family

967
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.729
are therefore entitled
to pool-side seats for life.


968
00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:59.089
Plus, strictly speaking,
she doesn't even need another chair.


969
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.129
Are you guests at this hotel?

970
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.889
Ah! No! I no swim!

971
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.809
Please, mister, I no swim, I beg you.

972
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.569
Not pool!

973
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:12.929
Argh!

974
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:13.969
All right. All right.

975
00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.329
It's just a joke! We're... We're mates!

976
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.289
(GASPING AND LAUGHTER)

977
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.569
So little, so little!

978
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:22.689
Ah!

979
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.489
Great.

980
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.009
And with a rough grab
from a BO-ridden security guard,


981
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:47.249
Simon's perfect plan came crashing down.

982
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:51.169
- Thanks a lot, Jay.
- Me?! What have I done?


983
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:52.609
Oh, I don't know... Oh, yeah!

984
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:54.249
Fucked everything up for me,
like you always do.


985
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.649
I had to teach him a lesson, Si,
he was mugging me off.


986
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:58.449
He was nine years old and couldn't swim!

987
00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:01.209
- Now my life is ruined. Thanks.
- Is this about the tickets?


988
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.289
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!

989
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:04.969
So, you don't get to go
to the boat party, so what?!


990
00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.769
So I don't get back together
with the woman I love!


991
00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.729
Look, it's not my fault
Carli thinks you're a prick.


992
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.089
You want to watch me more closely, mate,

993
00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.489
- you might actually learn something.
- Oh, yeah?


994
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.769
And what would I learn?

995
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:13.849
How to bullshit about having sex?

996
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:15.209
How to sleep in an ants' nest?

997
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.249
- How to be scared shitless of my dad?!
- Oh, come on, Si, calm down.


998
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.529
Maybe you'd learn not to be such
a massive tool over that miserable cunt.


999
00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:22.369
Don't call Carli a cunt!

1000
00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:37.009
(PANTING)

1001
00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:43.489
- You had enough yet?!
- Have you had enough yet?


1002
00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:45.129
- I asked first!
- Ah...


1003
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.529
- Uh!
- We should do something.


1004
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.009
Yeah, do you want to go
and get a Subway?


1005
00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:50.649
No. I meant about the fight,
we should break it up.


1006
00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.369
Yeah.

1007
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:53.849
All right, come on, you two.

1008
00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.169
No!

1009
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.649
Uh!

1010
00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.249
I'm sick of his bollocks,
I'm going to fucking do him.


1011
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.489
Oh, you're hard, Si,
I didn't see you do me just now.


1012
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.289
- Come back here, then, you prick.
- Let's go for a walk!


1013
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:04.769
- Don't cry, Si.
- I'm not crying!


1014
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.889
- You're crying!
- Don't look like it, you're crying!


1015
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.089
- Come here, then.
- See you later, then, Will.


1016
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:18.329
Honestly, I'm done with that arsehole.

1017
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:19.969
I mean, why do I even
hang round with him?


1018
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.889
Well, yeah, obviously
we all wonder that at times.


1019
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.849
Look, it's been a tough couple of days,
the Carli thing is weird,


1020
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:27.049
but just cos you were
in a fight with Jay,


1021
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:28.329
- you don't have to leave.
- I'm not leaving.


1022
00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.849
But you are aware
you're packing your suitcase.


1023
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.809
- I've never liked him.
- You've been mates since primary school.


1024
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:39.329
He's a little crybaby poof.

1025
00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:41.809
And his hair,
everyone took the piss out of that.


1026
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.569
But not me, I didn't.

1027
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:44.729
Fucking wish I had now.

1028
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.169
- You did a bit.
- Well, no, course, a bit.


1029
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:48.849
But...not enough.

1030
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:50.209
He's a total twat!

1031
00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:53.169
Oh, that's harsh, mate.
He can be a knob, but he's not a twat.


1032
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.649
- I'm going to sell my clothes.
- Oh, you're having a breakdown.


1033
00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.369
She means so much to me, Will,
I don't care about anything else.


1034
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:59.409
If I can get enough money together,

1035
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:00.889
I can buy a ticket
for the boat party off someone,


1036
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:03.929
somehow, whatever it costs.
Money is all I need.


1037
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.609
I agree with you on money,
but who's going to buy your clothes?


1038
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:07.369
No of fence, but you dress appallingly.

1039
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.249
Are you going to help
or just constantly undermine me?


1040
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.489
- Bit of both, I'd imagine.
- Fine.


1041
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:14.009
Do you think Alison likes me?

1042
00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:16.489
13 years he's been dragging me down.

1043
00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:17.969
Well...fuck him.

1044
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:19.249
- What's that?
- Boat party tickets,


1045
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:20.369
I bought four the other night

1046
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:22.609
before I passed out.
Cost a fortune.


1047
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.089
I thought I'd surprise him.

1048
00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:25.529
Well, here's his fucking surprise.

1049
00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.409
- Oh, no, Jay, don't.
- No, fuck him!


1050
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.809
And fuck that dick Will too.

1051
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.569
What shall we do now, then?

1052
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.529
Now we have the best holiday ever...

1053
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:44.129
- and do what we came here to do!
- Get better at swimming!


1054
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.609
No.

1055
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:48.209
Go on Pussay Patrol!

1056
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:49.649
Unfortunately for him,

1057
00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:53.209
Simon wasn't the only person in Malia
trying to sell shit no-one wanted.


1058
00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:54.329
- Looky, looky. Hello?
- Hello!


1059
00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:56.169
- Looky.
- Nice lady, good price.


1060
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.529
Clothes? Looky, looky.

1061
00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:59.889
Top clothes for sale.
You want clothes? Good price.


1062
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:03.249
I think you'd have more luck
selling the big glasses.


1063
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:04.649
Isn't that Carli's friend?

1064
00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:06.289
He's a rep,
I don't think they're really friends.


1065
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:07.529
All right, mate?

1066
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:09.009
What's this,
the world's shittest boot fair?


1067
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.449
Ha! No, just selling my clothes
for some money.


1068
00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:12.489
I need money, desperately.

1069
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.609
All right! Well, as luck would have it,

1070
00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:16.249
I've got a mate
who's had his apartment broken into.


1071
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:18.249
Fuckers nicked all his clothes.

1072
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:20.089
I reckon he'll be interested,
I'll call him.


1073
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.769
That'd be amazing, thanks so much.

1074
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:24.089
No problem, mate.
All part of the service, yeah?


1075
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:25.489
- See?
- All right, mate?


1076
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.569
Yeah, yeah. Got some clothes.

1077
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:30.049
Yeah. Um, got some girls' T-shirts.

1078
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:31.929
- These are girls', right?
- No.


1079
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.449
Hoodies like your mum would buy you.

1080
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.009
The sort of jeans Jeremy Clarkson wears.

1081
00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.729
Oh, yeah, yeah!
It's all shit, yeah. Hold on.

oh, my God. Thanks so much, man.

1086
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:50.369
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, that's the deal.


1087
00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.249
Obviously he's not going
to take his clothes off.


1088
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:54.889
Oh, nice one.

Oh!

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.929
He's going to need your pants too.

1091
00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.329
What, these?

1092
00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:01.529
Fuckin' thieves stole everything.

1093
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:04.649
Gimme your pants, I'll be back
before you know it with your 100 euros.


1094
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.009
Sorry, this has gone too far.
Simon, do not take your pants off.

- Course I will.

I'll see you very soon.

James isn't coming back, is he?

Don't think so.

1105
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:44.009
Brilliant.

1106
00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:47.569

and headed home to get changed.

In just 24 hours, Malia had pretty much
broken me and Simon,


1117
00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.489
so in a way I had to admire
Jay and Neil


1118
00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:35.529
as they rolled up the sleeves
on their offensive T-shirts

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:38.729
No, it's just the smoke in here.

1199
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:39.769
There isn't any.

1200
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:42.049
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1201
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:43.729
Do you want to go somewhere
not decadent?


1202
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:14.089
So what happens now?
It's probably a bit far


1203
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:16.209
for my dad to
come and pick us up.

1204
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:20.929
- Oh, great.
- WILL: Be nice,


1205
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:22.529
maybe he's come to apologise.

1206
00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:34.769
All right?

1207
00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:35.889
We were just leaving, actually.

1208
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.049
- Oh, don't cry, Simon.
- I'm not crying.


1209
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:39.089
No, Jay, it was you that was crying,

1210
00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:40.329
- remember?
- Neil!


1211
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:42.529
Come on, Si, sit down,
let's all share a fishbowl.


1212
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.369
- We're totally out of cash.
- Yeah.


1213
00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:45.929
We're not all lucky enough
to have had a relative die.


1214
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:47.729
Well, you're clearly fucked without me,

1215
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:49.249
so I was going to offer
to pay for your drinks,


1216
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:50.609
but if you're going
to be a baby about it,


1217
00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:52.289
- then fuck it.
- Were you really?


1218
00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:57.049
Well, I'm not arsed either way,
but if I have to...yes.


1219
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.449
Si?

1220
00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.409
All right, thank you, Jay.

1221
00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:05.289
Shake.

1222
00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:13.689
Group hug?

1223
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:16.929
(NEIL GUFFAWS)

1224
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.249
Oh, go on, Neil,
just one more suicide shot.


1225
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:20.529
Fuckin' hell.

1226
00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:36.369
Right. Tenner, please.

1227
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:39.049
- Sorry, mate, had my fingers crossed.
- Oh, not again!


1228
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.049
WILL: Oh, my God!
I never expected to see them again.


1229
00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:45.129
Doesn't matter, though, does it?
Cos even if Lucy


1230
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:47.489
can get a ticket for the boat party,
I now can't afford one.


1231
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:50.409
Yes, but incredible as it may seem,
Simon, I wasn't thinking about you.


1232
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:51.489
JANE: Hi, guys.

1233
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:53.809
Taking a break from drowning children?

1234
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:54.849
We are.

1235
00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:56.409
And welcome back to Malia's
least-cool bar.


1236
00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:57.649
We're regulars, obviously.

1237
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:59.249
Surprised to see you here again.

1238
00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:01.849
Well, it's the only place we've been
where the blokes weren't total animals.


1239
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:03.929
I'll take that as a compliment.
Hello, by the way.


1240
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:05.129
Hello, Spectacles.

1241
00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:07.289
Still going to get shit-faced, though.
Shots only?


1242
00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.569
- Are you man enough, Jay-bo?
- Course.


1243
00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:10.889
Thought you would be.

1244
00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:13.569
Obviously we now rated as
so sexually non-threatening


1245
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:15.049
that these girls were happy
to drink with us.


1246
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.929
But to be fair,
I'd take that every time.


1247
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:21.209
So I've been thinking, about us...

1248
00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:23.449
- What, the four of you?
- No, me and you.


1249
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:24.489
Well, there is no "us",

1250
00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:26.969
so that must have been a weird
thought process, but go on.


1251
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:29.689
- I'm not sure Nicos is right for you.
- Interesting.


1252
00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:32.529
Why wouldn't my sexy, charming,
caring boyfriend,


1253
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:34.329
who is also a sensational lover,

1254
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.489
- be right for me?
- You'd say sensational, would you?


1255
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:38.329
- Mmm.
- Mmm.


1256
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.609
It was nice of Richard Branson
to lend you an outfit.


1257
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:42.049
It's Neil's. Is it really that bad?

1258
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:46.009
Well, at least you look fantastic.
Right, there's only one thing for it,


1259
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:47.049
we're going to say, "fuck it",

1260
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:49.369
and do shots until one of us is sick
through our nose. My money's on me.


1261
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:51.289
Four monkey brains, please.

1262
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:53.409
I like this Simon, he's fun.

1263
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.049
Thanks very much.

1264
00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:56.289
- Cheers!
- Cheers.


1265
00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:57.649
Oh, actually, can you pay?

1266
00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:03.169
Right, next!

1267
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:04.649
No, no. I can't have another one.

1268
00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:06.529
I'm sorry, didn't realise
you were a lightweight.


1269
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:08.969
- What?
- Lightweight. Light-weight.


1270
00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:10.409
You're one to talk about lightweights.

1271
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:11.769
What do you mean?

1272
00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:13.649
Oh. Cos I'm fat?

1273
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:15.249
No.

1274
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.689
What I...mean, Jane, is...

1275
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:20.289
I'm gonna drink you under the table.

1276
00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:21.649
You're trouble, aren't you?

1277
00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:26.209
You're funny.

1278
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.009
That is why I know you don't have
to worry about getting laid.


1279
00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:30.729
Um, did I say I was worried?

1280
00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:32.409
No, but it's obvious that you are,

1281
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:34.169
and you think
that somehow I'm the answer.


1282
00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:35.969
Well, I am not,
and you will be fine.

1283
00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:38.569
I think you might be, though.

1284
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:39.969
Nonsense.

1285
00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.849
You know, in fact, I am so confident
I will make a pact with you.


1286
00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:45.569
If you still haven't had sex
by this time next year,


1287
00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:46.769
I'll have sex with you.

1288
00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:49.169
As long as I'm not with Nicos,
of course.


1289
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:50.449
Of course.

1290
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:51.769
Um...

1291
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:53.209
this is a joke, right?

1292
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:56.809
A handshake's good...

1293
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.849
is it possible to get it in writing?

1294
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.569
See? Funny.

1295
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:03.609
Yes, ha-ha-ha. Hmm.

1296
01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.369
You all right, Lise? Where's Neil?

1297
01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.969
He is literally incredible.

1298
01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:17.529
Come on, Lise,
we're getting out of here.


1299
01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.369
Let's go for a swim. Come on, you.

1300
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:21.729
You coming swimming?

1301
01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.729
Oh. I can't cos I haven't brought
my swimming costume.


1302
01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:26.449
Oh, no! I haven't brought mine either.

1303
01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:27.889
Really? What are you going to do?

1304
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:30.929
Well, I'm going to
go in naked. Are you?

1305
01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:34.569
Oh, right. Yeah, me too.

1306
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:37.729
Totally naked.

1307
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.569
Are they really going skinny dipping?

1308
01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:41.609
- If I know Jane, probably, yeah.
- Really?


1309
01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:44.489
- Fucking hell, really?!
- Yes.


1310
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:46.249
And...

1311
01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:48.449
...what about you?

1312
01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:52.129
Well, I'm meeting Nicos in half an hour.

1313
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:53.569
Course.

1314
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:55.289
So I reckon I've got time
for a quick dip.


1315
01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:57.689
Alison was hopelessly out of my league.

1316
01:00:57.810 --> 01:00:59.609
And yet, and yet...

1317
01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:01.089
No, I had no fucking chance.

1318
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:03.129
(GIGGLES)

1319
01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:09.889
Come on. What are you doing?

1320
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.169
Get it off.

1321
01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:13.529
No, yeah. Good. I will.

1322
01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:15.089
Go on, then.

1323
01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.729
All in good time.

1324
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:19.929
I'll look away, if you like.

1325
01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:22.769
Um, yeah, that would be nice, thank you.

1326
01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:27.729
OK, so, I'm looking away now.

1327
01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:33.889
And so for only the second time today,

1328
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:36.129
Simon was tricked into getting naked.

1329
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.129
Further along the beach,
for the first time ever, Jay was close


1330
01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:42.169
to seeing some naked women
not on a computer screen.


1331
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:48.289
Come on, Jay, don't be shy.

1332
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:50.169
I'll take it all off if you will.

1333
01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.849
Um, all right, just...give me a minute.

1334
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:55.369
Are you scared that you won't be able
to control yourself?


1335
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:58.729
MAN: She's a big girl. 
She is a big girl.

1336
01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:01.609
Can't take it any more,
just give us a snog.


1337
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:03.689
Um...all right.

1338
01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:07.369
But...let's go somewhere secret.

1339
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:08.769
Secret?

1340
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.089
Just give us a snog here.

1341
01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.529
Nah.

1342
01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:14.209
Let's go somewhere
people can't see us.


1343
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:17.249
- OK?
- Fucking whale on the beach.


1344
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:20.169
Actually...forget it.

1345
01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:22.849
I've already seen your cock,
and it wasn't pretty.


1346
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:32.369
All I'm saying is that, logically,

1347
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:34.289
we might not have to wait
a year to have sex.


1348
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:35.729
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.


1349
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:39.409
I mean, once you remove Nicos from the
equation and think, as I say, logically,


1350
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.209
it really makes no sense
to wait that long.


1351
01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:44.129
Do you find that your logic
talks a lot of girls into bed?


1352
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:45.609
Well, no.

1353
01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:46.649
I was just curious to know

1354
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:50.409
whether this kind of relentless, pedantic
chat is a big hit with the other chicks.


1355
01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:54.089
- Well, obviously, it isn't.
- Thought not.


1356
01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:03.089
What are you waiting for?

1357
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.929
Um...I don't know.

1358
01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:08.609
OK.

Don't be such a wuss.

1365
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:35.009
Ah!

1366
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:37.489
That's right,
let's get someone's hair wet, shall we?


1367
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:40.089
It always looks wet anyway, gel-boy.

1368
01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.969
Right, how's this for a wet look, then?

You're not wussing out on me, are you?

1379
01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:23.849
Nope! As soon as I'm not blind,

1380
01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:26.449
I'll be right over with you
and the other naked ladies.


1381

bit quiet for five minutes, please...

you are the only girl for me,

there no other girl in my life.

1406

Now, where have we heard that before?

1407
01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:20.049
Oh, just shut up, Will!

1408
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:21.929
Baby, you know this weirdo?

1409
01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:24.049
I am not your fucking baby!

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.329
Alison, wait!

1411

Simon.

1412
01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:29.769
Are you swimming naked?

1413
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.009
Hell, yeah.

1414
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:33.009
- That's not like you.
- Well, I'm on holidays,


1415
01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:34.849
so who knows, maybe it's a new me?

1416
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:36.329
Oh, right.

1417
01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.129

- No, sure. I'm all wet anyway, so...
- Look,

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:50.689
I'm knackered, I've had a shitty night,
I just want to be alone.


1424
01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:53.929
But I'll see you at the boat party.
We can catch up properly there, OK?


1425
01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:56.129
Yeah, course.

1426
01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:58.449
- See you at the boat party.
- Great.


1427
01:06:58.570 --> 01:06:59.529
See ya!

1428
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:02.089
- I miss you too.
- Sorry?


1429
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:03.449
You said it the other night?

1430
01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:05.369
Oh, yeah.

Alison, wait! I'll come with you!

1433
01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:21.609
- I want to be on my own!
- Um...


1434
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:22.889
You're not expecting me
to hit him or anything,


1435
01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:24.569
- are you?
- No!


1436
01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:25.649
- Good.
- I don't expect


1437
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:27.449
anything from anyone
but disappointment.


1438
01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:29.049
You'll love me, then.

1439
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:32.529
And I will never have sex
with anyone again for as long as I live,


1440
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:33.729
and certainly not with you.

1441
01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.049
So just fuck off!

1442
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:36.889
All of you, just fuck off!

1443
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.809

Oh! Are you getting out?

1448
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:53.769
- Yes.
- That was Carli, did you see her?


1449
01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:56.089
Yeah.

1450
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:57.409
It was dark, but I saw her.

1451
01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:58.729
Isn't she beautiful?

1452
01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:00.769
Yes, she's very beautiful.

1453
01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:03.649
I'm going now.

1454
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:05.409
Oh. OK!

1455
01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:33.889
- All right?
- I've been better.


1456
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:36.209
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinking.


1457
01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:37.729
About how shit the holiday is?

1458
01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:40.689
Partly that. Partly I'm thinking
about putting stones in my pockets


1459
01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:41.929
and chucking myself in the pool.

1460
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:44.409
Oh, I wouldn't swim in that, it's rank.

1461
01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:45.449
Right.

1462
01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:46.809
Also, if you put stones in your pockets,

1463
01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:49.489
you'll sink, so...better to not
have the stones, really.


1464
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:51.329
I'll bear that in mind, Neil.

1465
01:08:53.370 --> 01:08:57.329
I stopped believing in God when
I realised it was just "dog" backwards.


1466
01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:58.809
What?

1467
01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:02.569
Well, when you think about it -
G-O-D, D-O-G.


1468
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:04.769
It's like an anagram,
but a backwards one, innit?


1469
01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.049
Right.

1470
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:08.689
And then, after that,
I just stopped worrying about stuff.


1471
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.849
You only get one go round, I reckon.
When you're dead, you're dead.


1472
01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:14.329
So you can spend your time thinking
about how things haven't gone perfect


1473
01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:17.169
or you can just get on with it,
have a laugh and that.


1474
01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:18.849
That's what I do, 
I'm pretty happy.

1475
01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:21.809
You are, aren't you?

1476
01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:23.009
Yeah!

1477
01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:25.609
Thanks, Neil. Thanks for that.

1478
01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:28.809
Just remember, it's D
-O
-G backwards.

1479
01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.209
No, not that.

1480
01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:32.369
No of fence, but that's moronic.
No, thanks for coming to cheer me up.


1481
01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:33.769
I didn't come to cheer you up,

1482
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:35.689
I come to say I did a shit
in the children's toilet


1483
01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:36.969
and I can't get rid of it.

1484
01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.409
Oh, God!

1485
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:42.009
Cos I thought I'd try something
different, you know? As a treat.


1486
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:44.209
- Oh...
- Oh!


1487
01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:46.569
Oh!

1488
01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:48.209
Neil, what the fuck has gone into that?

1489
01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:50.049
Have you been eating tear gas?

1490
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:51.569
No, it's just a bit beery.

1491
01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:53.489
And that meatiness
is probably the kebabs.


1492
01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:56.569
OK, that's it. 
Neil, you were right.

1493
01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:57.649
It may not be paradise,

1494
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.529
but we can at least try and enjoy
this place for exactly what it is.


1495
01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:00.769
A shithole?

1496
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:02.569
Yes, but it's our shithole,
so let's get out there


1497
01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:05.249
and get royally fucked up
on Jay's dead grandad's money.


1498

It's what he would have wanted.

1499

If we get fined 50 euros, Neil,
you're paying it.


1500
01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:11.809
- But it's not on the floor.

# It's my... It's my...
It's my... #


1506
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:52.929
(SONG DISTORTS)

1507
01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:58.289
Is this normal enough for you?

1508
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:00.529
- Probably a bit too normal.
- (LAUGHTER)


1509
01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.049
(WILL SPLUTTERS)

1510
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:06.049
(COUGHS)

1511
01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:07.929
SIMON: I'm almost going to miss him
when I'm at uni.


1512
01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:09.729
When he's at uni, you mean.

1513
01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:13.289
- Yeah, but I'll be at uni too.
- Will ya?


1514
01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:15.169
- What, this year?
- In a few weeks.


1515
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:18.249
Oh, what? Just cos Will's going?

1516
01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:21.209
- No. Cos I want to.
- Well...what about me?


1517
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:22.529
What?

1518
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.249
Well, what am I going to do?

1519
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:29.569
Um...I don't know.

1520
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:32.689
Look, I thought you knew
I was going to uni.


1521
01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:35.609
Yeah, course. No, but...

1522
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:37.649
it's just that I was going to use
my grandad's money


1523
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.609
to set us up in business,
selling car stereos


1524
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:42.129
to Premiership footballers.

1525
01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.049
Neil was going
to work in the depot, but...


1526
01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:47.249
me, you and Rio Ferdinand are on sales,
like, having a laugh and that.


1527
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:49.489
Oh, right.

1528
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:51.649
Yeah, I'm going to do sociology.

1529
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:54.649
Fuck.

1530
01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:59.329
I'm sorry I ripped your tickets up now.
Could have had a bit of a send-off.


1531
01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:02.609
- What tickets?
- Boat party ones.


1532
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:05.969
I bought them when I was pissed the
other night. I thought I'd surprise you.


1533
01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:09.969
- Oh, well.
- You what... You tore them up?!


1534
01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:14.649
- Yeah.
- What, after we had the fight?


1535
01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:18.009
Yeah, I...I was angry
cos you had a go, and that.


1536
01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:20.129
Yeah, sure.

1537
01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:23.209
Makes sense.

1538
01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.009
You fucking arsehole!

1539
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:30.289
Yeah? You want me
to fucking mash you up again,


1540
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:31.329
- do ya?
- Yeah!


1541
01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.609
- Yeah?
- Yeah!


1542
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:38.329
Oh, you two...can't I even have a piss
out of the end of my cock in peace?


1543
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:42.449
You two go on,

1544
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:46.849
I'm just going to have
a little recovery snooze.


1545
01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:00.689
Come on, mate,
you can have my bed tonight,


1546
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:02.289
this one's a bit bitey.

1547
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:09.049
Did I tell you
I touched a boob tonight?

1548
01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:11.249
Like... Like a real boob.

1549
01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:14.689
A girl's one.
I didn't get to lick it, though.


1550
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:17.329
This has been the
best night of my life.

1551
01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:30.409
It was the day of the boat party,

1552
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:33.529
and it looked like literally
everyone in Malia had a ticket.


1553
01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:35.129
Well, everyone except me and Simon,

1554
01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.729
whose mood was now bluer than his balls.

1555
01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:40.769
If I could, I'd
give you my ticket, Si.

1556
01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:42.729
You can, just give me your ticket.

1557
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:45.969
Yeah, but I really want to go,
so you see, actually, I can't.


1558
01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:48.089
- Take Jay's ticket.
- No, I think he needs it.


1559
01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:49.329
What, cos of Jane?

1560
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:53.329
No, in case the captain dies
and they need me to drive the boat.


1561
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:56.049
(GROANING)

1562
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:59.449
Eased up on the vomiting,
mainly retching now.


1563
01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:01.329
For the record, they don't clean
that toilet floor very often,


1564
01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:03.369
lots of pubes on hands, knees...
and my face


1565
01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:06.609
when I had a little lie-down.
I cannot believe we've been eating here.


1566
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:07.649
Wow, they look hot!

1567
01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:10.209
- Bit young for you, ain't they, Neil?
- Behave.


1568
01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:12.609
Lucy. Lucy!

1569
01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:16.129
Alison! Aliso...
Oh. I give up.


1570
01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:18.889
All right, boys? 
Who killed Will?

1571
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:20.089
(GROANS)

1572
01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:22.209
- What's up with Lucy?
- I don't know.


1573
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:25.249
If you ask her rather than
talking about your ex the whole time,


1574
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:28.209
- you might find out.
- Oh, God, really?


1575
01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:30.209
Fine.

1576
01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:32.889
- You coming to the boat party, then?
- You try and stop me.


1577
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:35.529
We just saw two hot fellas
dressed as firemen getting on board.


1578
01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:37.689
Might need a hand with their hoses.

1579
01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:40.289
Might have to set fire to my knickers.

1580
01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:42.489
- I'll come with you, if you like.
- No, thank you.


1581
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:43.809
Come on, Lisa.

1582
01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:47.689
You look as bad on the outside
as I feel on the inside.


1583
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:51.169
Oh, don't worry,
I feel like shit on the inside too.


1584
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:52.649
Although...

1585
01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:54.489
I don't have a pube on my cheek.

1586
01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:55.969
Oh, God.

1587
01:15:56.090 --> 01:16:00.009
Anyway, seeing you in such a mess
has at least cheered me up a bit.


1588
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:01.049
Glad to be of service.

1589
01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:04.009
You know I have a penis
sunburnt on my back too.


1590
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:06.489
Must be reassuring to know
that however bad life gets,


1591
01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:07.529
you're not me.

1592
01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:08.569
It is.

1593
01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:11.729
Good. That means every time you're down,
you have to come and hang out with me.


1594
01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:12.889
Yeah, I think I might.

1595
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:14.289
Starting with today.

1596
01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:16.489
I've got Nicos's ticket
for the boat party.


1597
01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:17.529
Do you fancy joining me?

1598
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:19.009
Um, yes.

1599
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:20.249
More than anything.

1600
01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:22.449
Great. On one condition, though.

1601
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:23.809
Anything.

1602
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:26.449
At no point are you allowed
to say, "I told you so."


1603
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:29.049
Ooh, not sure I can guarantee that.

1604
01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:31.729
So it's not that I'd rather go
to a party that infinitely heightens


1605
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:33.929
my sense of being out of kilter
with the rest of the world,


1606
01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:36.769
it's just that Alison is sort of
the fittest girl I've ever met


1607
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:38.689
- and maybe...
- It's fine, Will, honestly.


1608
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:41.529
Go for it, I'll just find a quiet spot
and hang myself.


1609
01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:43.729
Great. Lucy, make sure
he doesn't hang himself.


1610
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:46.489
I'm off. Look at me,
following my cock like a normal person.


1611
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:51.249
Sorry for saying cock.

1612
01:16:57.610 --> 01:16:59.729
I didn't realise
I was being such a dick.


1613
01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.489
You were.

1614
01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:07.369
- I'm trying to say sorry.
- Well, say it, then.


1615
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:08.889
Sorry.

1616
01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:10.569
For being a dick.

1617
01:17:10.690 --> 01:17:12.289
Sorry for being a dick.

1618
01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:15.329
And for having too much gel
in your hair.


1619
01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:17.049
I don't think I've got that much...

1620
01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:19.889
OK, I'm sorry for having
too much gel in my hair.


1621
01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.849
You should probably get going.

1622
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:27.369
I'm not that bothered.

1623
01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:28.409
Really?

1624
01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:29.649
Yeah.

1625
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.529
If you like, maybe we could hang out,
the two of us.


1626
01:17:32.650 --> 01:17:34.489
I quite fancy just staying by the pool.

1627
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:38.209
Yeah, I mean, why spend the day
having unbelievable fun on the party boat


1628
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:41.729
when you could be taking a depressed man
swimming at a family hotel?


1629
01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:42.809
I'm serious.

1630
01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:44.369
I don't mind.

1631
01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:47.289
I might even cheer you up...

1632
01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:49.169
if they let you back in.

1633
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.849
I honestly don't think
I'll be very good company,


1634
01:17:51.970 --> 01:17:53.489
but thanks for the offer.

1635
01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:55.729
You go, I'll be all right.

1636
01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.129
Look...

1637
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:06.689
it's obvious how much
Carli means to you.


1638
01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.529
She's lucky...

1639
01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:09.689
I think.

1640
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.289
I'm sure you'll sort it out.

1641
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.409
She goes back tomorrow.
I can feel her slipping away.


1642
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:20.609
Simon...

1643
01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:23.329
if she really means that much to you,

1644
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:25.089
I want you to take my ticket.

1645
01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:27.649
Lucy...

1646
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:30.889
If you really want to go, take it.

1647
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:34.969
If you really want to go.

1648
01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:37.649
God, you'd do that for me?

1649
01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:39.529
Yeah.

1650
01:18:40.770 --> 01:18:42.489
Thanks!

1651
01:18:42.610 --> 01:18:44.849
I'll see you later,
enjoy the pool! Will!


1652
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.449
Will! I got a ticket, 
I got a ticket!

1653
01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:48.049
Will!

1654
01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:49.729
I got a ticket, 
I got a ticket!

1655
01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:57.489
# We are go!

1656
01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:01.049
# The time has
come to leave this place

1657
01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:04.929
# Leave it all behind

1658
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:08.569
# There's so much more here to envision

1659
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:11.249
# Out of your mind... #

1660
01:19:11.370 --> 01:19:13.729
WILL: The boat party
was Jay's promised land...


1661
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:16.409
sun, sea, booze, and who knows,

1662
01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:20.449
maybe even some sex, minge,
fanny and tits...and booze...and sex.


1663
01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:21.529
Mental!

1664
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:24.009
- Cheeky shot to get us started?
- You are kidding.


1665
01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:25.089
Oh, come on, it's the best cure.

1666
01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:26.489
Fair enough, what are we toasting?

1667
01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:28.769
To the Pussay!

1668
01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.569
ALL: The Pussay!

1669
01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:34.449
Neil?

1670
01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:35.849
To being playas!

1671
01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:37.609
ALL: Playas!

1672
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:41.209
Si?

1673
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:42.289
To me and Carli!

1674
01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:44.249
- No, you're all right, mate.
- Fuck off.


1675
01:19:46.330 --> 01:19:49.529
Fine. Well, I'm going off
to find her, anyway.


1676
01:19:49.650 --> 01:19:52.049
- Oh, Si, I forgot something.
- What?


1677
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:54.049
Ah! For fuck's sake.

1678
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:56.009
You know I should probably find Jane,
I promised her a dance.


1679
01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:59.129
- What?
- Well, no, just a dance.


1680
01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.089
And then we can get
some proper fit gash.


1681
01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:02.169
But Jane's all right, you know.

1682
01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:03.289
She's a laugh.

1683
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:04.529
The fat ones are always jolly.

1684
01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:07.529
Neil, what a horrible thing to say.

1685
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:10.969
- Just you and me, then, Will.
- Oh, no.


1686
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:13.569
Oh, God.
What was I thinking, tequila?!


1687
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:17.849
Shit, sorry!

1688
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:22.169
Sorry!

1689
01:20:24.130 --> 01:20:26.449
Make your bloody mind up, you wally!

1690
01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:30.769
(SIGHS)

1691
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:55.089
Richard! All right, mate?

1692
01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:56.289
- All right!
- How's it going?


1693
01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:57.369
Yeah, not too bad.

1694
01:20:57.490 --> 01:20:59.769
I was DJing at this techno club, right?

1695
01:20:59.890 --> 01:21:01.809
And this mental emo bird
comes over to me and says,


1696
01:21:01.930 --> 01:21:03.609
"I want you to piss on me
and then fuck me."


1697
01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:04.729
So I pissed all over her.

1698
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:05.769
And then fucked her?

1699
01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:06.929
No, she was covered in piss!

1700
01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:07.969
Oh, course.

1701
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:10.009
Anyway, the other day, right?

1702
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:11.889
I started crying and couldn't stop,

1703
01:21:12.010 --> 01:21:15.609
so yeah, my mum and dad have flown over
to take me home. Pretty cool.


1704
01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:23.129
Yeah...

1705
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.369
Come and say hello?

1706
01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:26.089
All right.

1707
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:29.689
Dad, Mum.

1708
01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:31.849
All right...

1709
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:34.409
Back off, bitch!

1710
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:36.329
Not this time.

1711
01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:42.249
Jane?

1712
01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:44.249
- Jane!
- Oh, hello.


1713
01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:46.249
Sure you want to be seen with me?

1714
01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:49.049
Yeah, I do. I really do.

1715
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.289
Can we have that snog now?

1716
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:53.809
What? Now? Here?
Right in front of everyone?


1717
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:57.009
Um...yeah. Yeah.

1718
01:21:57.130 --> 01:21:58.649
Yeah? Well, I'm not that kind of girl.

1719
01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:00.089
Oh.

1720
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:03.209
(POSH VOICE) So, I suggest
we find somewhere a little more private.


1721
01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:05.489
- I don't mind.
- I told you,


1722
01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:09.529
I do. And, to be fair, in private
you might get a blow job out of it.


1723
01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:21.889
- Simey!
- Oh, hi!


1724
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:23.089
Carli!

1725
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:27.129
Where have you been?

1726
01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.689
- I've been looking all over for you.
- I need to tell you something.


1727
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:31.609
Ssh! I know.

1728
01:22:51.450 --> 01:22:52.369
Get it all up.

1729
01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:54.689
Little easier
on the sunburnt cock, please.


1730
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:55.849
Sorry.

1731
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.009
It's fine.

1732
01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:00.729
I mean, what a total twat!

1733
01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:01.769
Me?!

1734
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:04.969
No, Nicos, the total
and utter Greek twat.


1735
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:06.049
Did you see her?

1736
01:23:06.170 --> 01:23:08.289
She was hideous,
she must have been at least 30.


1737
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:11.049
I told you so.

1738
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:12.929
You arsehole, you had to say it,
didn't you?


1739
01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:14.609
Even in the fucking state you're in,

1740
01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:18.169
- you couldn't resist.
- Sorry. But at least I'm consistent.


1741
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:20.569
Yes, you are, aren't you?

1742
01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:26.929
OK, so I think I'd like
to revise my offer.


1743
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:29.809
How about instead of having sex
with you in a year,


1744
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:32.169
I have sex with you all year?

1745
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:35.089
What?

1746
01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:38.049
- It's a one-time offer.
- To confirm,


1747
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:40.289
do you mean like a girlfriend
or like a prostitute?


1748
01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:42.889
I was thinking more like a girlfriend.

1749
01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:47.809
- Could you write it...
- No! I am not going to write it down.


1750
01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:50.969
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
I like you.


1751
01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:54.129
Despite myself, 
I really do like you.

1752
01:23:55.450 --> 01:23:57.169
If you like me too, then we're on.

1753
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:02.489
Um...but not till you've
brushed your teeth.


1754
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:04.449
Oh!

1755
01:24:09.690 --> 01:24:12.769
- That should do it.
- You know we could do this for ever.


1756
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:14.809
Yeah, I know, yeah.

1757
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:16.609
Oh, God, Carls, 
I thought I'd lost you.

1758
01:24:16.730 --> 01:24:17.969
I thought I'd lost you!

1759
01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:20.329
And no matter how many times they hit me
in the balls, I knew I was right.


1760
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:22.569
And I've worked it all out,
it was so simple.


1761
01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:24.089
I'll just get a job near your uni
for three years,


1762
01:24:24.210 --> 01:24:27.369
four if you do an MA,
and then we can be together for ever.


1763
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:28.849
For ever.

1764
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:30.049
Just like we should be.

1765
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:33.929
Carli...

1766
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:36.449
...what's wrong?

1767
01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:38.209
Did you hear what I said?

1768
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:39.729
Something about being hit in the balls?

1769
01:24:39.850 --> 01:24:41.409
Well, yeah, but...

1770
01:24:41.530 --> 01:24:43.529
mainly about being together for ever.

1771
01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:46.009
Sorry, Simon,
could you just kiss me again?


1772
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:57.129
Sorry, Carls, this is wrong.

1773
01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:58.409
What?

1774
01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:00.329
I've made a bad choice today.

1775
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:05.409
I honestly wish you
all the best with your life,


1776
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:07.569
but right now, 
I have to leave.

1777
01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:10.209
I don't think you'll ever see me again.

1778
01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:15.049
But I'll see you at your mum's birthday
in two weeks' time.


1779
01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:17.009
Well, yeah, but then after that.

1780
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:19.449
And then your brother's 16th
the following week.


1781
01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:21.769
Yeah, it was more
of a metaphorical thing.


1782
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:24.289
- Anyway, I'll see you around, Carls.
- Yes,


1783
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:27.209
- at your mum's.
- Please, can I just...


1784
01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:28.409
Thank you.

1785
01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:33.729
Below deck, Neil was being as faithful
as ever to his girlfriend,


1786
01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:36.729
by aggressively dry-humping Lisa
to within an inch of her life.


1787
01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:41.209
Neil...

1788
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:44.049
Neil, stop.

1789
01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:45.769
What's up? Is it my zip?
I can undo it, if you want.


1790
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:48.329
No, it's not that.

1791
01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:49.929
I just think this is wrong.

1792
01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:52.009
I feel bad for your girlfriend.

1793
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:55.049
- No, it's fine, we aren't kissing.
- Yeah, but...


1794
01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:56.969
look at what we are doing.

1795
01:25:57.090 --> 01:26:02.049
I mean, how do you think you'd feel
if you saw her doing this with a guy?


1796
01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:04.369
I wouldn't want to be treated like this.

1797
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:06.849
- I've got ethics.
- Yeah.


1798
01:26:06.970 --> 01:26:09.689
Yeah, you're right,
it's just that, um...


1799
01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:13.529
...Nicole dumped me
before we got out here


1800
01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:16.409
and I didn't want to say anything
to the others cos I was embarrassed.


1801
01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:18.489
- Oh, Neil...
- Yeah.


1802
01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:22.569
She sent me this text, saying like,
"You dance like a twat, you are dumped."


1803
01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:24.769
It broke me up.

1804
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:28.489
So...this is fine and, if you want,
we can even kiss.


1805
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:30.329
Oh, Neil!

1806
01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:31.929
Is that true? Really?

1807
01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:33.729
Yeah, course.

1808
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:34.849
If you like.

1809
01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:44.689
That was just... I mean...

1810
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:47.569
Did it not taste funny?
Cos it looks funny.


1811
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:48.849
All right, mate, who's this, then?

1812
01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:50.169
Hi, I'm Jane.

1813
01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:52.249
- She's my girlfriend.
- Oh, is she?


1814
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:54.929
Fuckin' hell, you want to be careful
she doesn't fall overboard


1815
01:26:55.050 --> 01:26:56.169
- cos...
- Cos I'll get harpooned?


1816
01:26:56.290 --> 01:26:58.449
Cos they might think I'm a new island?

1817
01:26:58.570 --> 01:27:00.449
Cos all the water will splash out
onto the land?


1818
01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:02.369
I've heard them all, take your pick.

1819
01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:04.929
Fuckin' 'ell, tubs, all right,
it was only a joke.


1820
01:27:05.050 --> 01:27:08.009
Anyway, seeing as you're coming
out there like a naughty boy,


1821
01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:11.129
how about you do me a favour?
I need a note for the old toot.


1822
01:27:11.250 --> 01:27:13.969
We weren't doing drugs, actually.

1823
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:15.569
Christ, for his sake, 
I hope you were.

1824
01:27:15.690 --> 01:27:18.489
There are laws against fucking cow,
mate, even in Greece.


1825
01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:23.049
Now, I'm going to need to take that note
off you. You're a mate.


1826
01:27:23.170 --> 01:27:25.049
You don't mind, do you?

1827
01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:26.569
Give.

1828
01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:30.449
No, no, not at all.

1829
01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:36.969
There you are, mate, already rolled.

1830
01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:38.809
Cheers. I'll keep this, yeah?

1831
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:40.129
No problemo.

1832
01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:44.169
WILL: I think the Government's
anti-drugs campaign


1833
01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:46.009
would be more successful
if they pointed out


1834
01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:47.129
that every now and again,

1835
01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:49.969
there's a small chance you might
accidentally snort some poo.


1836
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.369
(RETCHES)

1837
01:27:58.930 --> 01:28:00.089
Simon?

1838
01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:01.609
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.


1839
01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:05.129
Yeah, for the first time in my life,
I think I actually am.


1840
01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:06.289
I'm clear, anyway.

1841
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:07.369
How'd it go with Carli?

1842
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.249
Long term - good. 
Short term - horrific.

1843
01:28:09.370 --> 01:28:11.329
Have you murdered her?

1844
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:13.329
No, but I am starting to think
that maybe Carli's not all that.


1845
01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:14.569
Well, it's taken a while.

1846
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:16.809
- Better late than never.
- I think Lucy might be the one.


1847
01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:18.889
Yes, obviously.

1848
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:20.929
Lucy's much nicer
and actually likes you.


1849
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.929
But I'm worried I might have been
a bit of a dick to her.


1850
01:28:23.050 --> 01:28:26.649
You've been more than a bit of a dick
to her. You've been a massive dick to her.


1851
01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:28.369
She still likes you, anyway.

1852
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:29.769
Good, that's really good.

1853
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:39.089
Does he always strip when he's happy?

1854
01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:40.209
Yeah, normally.

1855
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:43.329
Simon!
You can't go up there, there's a sign.


1856
01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:44.609
Oh, sign(!)

1857
01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:46.609
Alison, will you text Lucy
and tell her I'm coming to get her?


1858
01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:47.769
Course I will.

1859
01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:49.049
Brilliant!

1860
01:28:49.170 --> 01:28:50.169
All right?

1861
01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:51.289
Yeah.

1862
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.449
What are you doing up there, then?

1863
01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:54.809
I'm going to swim back to shore
and tell Lucy how I feel.


1864
01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:56.169
How romantic.

1865
01:28:56.290 --> 01:28:57.729
It is, isn't it?

1866
01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:02.809
Is it a bit far?

1867
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:05.449
No, bollocks. You can see the shore.

1868
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:07.129
I've swum further than that underwater.

1869
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:08.929
Do it! Just swim there

1870
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:10.929
and show her what she means to you
and then kiss her.


1871
01:29:11.050 --> 01:29:11.969
On the fanny!

1872
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:13.289
- Jay!
- Sorry, darling.


1873
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:24.369
Right, fuck it, you only live once.

1874
01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:26.729
(CHEERING)

1875
01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:34.329
ALL: Jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump, jump!


1876
01:29:36.970 --> 01:29:38.969
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!

1877
01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:42.089
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump!


1878
01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:55.810
(CHEERING)

1879
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:43.769
I think he might be drowning.

1880
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:20.609
Simon!

1881
01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:26.409
Oh, I think I've shit myself.

1882
01:31:31.730 --> 01:31:33.809
Lucy, it's normally bigger, it was cold.

1883
01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:37.729
WILL: One of us should probably have
gone to hospital with Simon.


1884
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:40.609
But, to be perfectly honest,
we had more important things to do.


1885
