[tense music playing]

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:14.554
Everything all right?

11
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.091
Yeah. I'm fine.
Fine. Why?


12
00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:24.630
You get all that blood

Well, he isn't actually
gonna speak, is he?


32
00:03:49.107 --> 00:03:53.244
After all
his wife just died.


33
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.854
I have, uh, pastored
most of y'all for 20 years.


34
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.192
And, uh,
to be honest, I'm--


35
00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:09.395
I'm up here...

36
00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:14.900
because I don't know
how to do anything else.


37
00:04:19.137 --> 00:04:20.773
She was the best
part of me.


38
00:04:24.043 --> 00:04:25.444
Y'all know it, too.

39
00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:29.280
Half the time
you be clamoring


40
00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:31.584
to talk to her
after church and not me.


41
00:04:31.717 --> 00:04:33.386
[chuckles]

42
00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:39.825
I've spent
my whole life...


43
00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.862
waiting to talk to her.

44
00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:50.403
I guess I'll be waiting
a little longer still.


45

[sniffs, clears throat]

46
00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:59.177
A lot of people
have asked me...


47
00:05:01.346 --> 00:05:05.350
what I think
of Troy Parker Junior...


48
00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:09.455
about whether
he deserves to pay


49
00:05:09.588 --> 00:05:12.725
for Elizabeth's life
with his own.


50
00:05:20.298 --> 00:05:22.200
Love your enemies.

51
00:05:24.904 --> 00:05:27.940
Pray for those
who hate you.


52
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:32.111
Lord, forgive us
our sins as we forgive


53
00:05:32.243 --> 00:05:35.381
those who have sinned
against us.


54
00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:41.787
I believe there is
power in forgiveness.


55
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:43.556
I have to believe that.

56
00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:47.660
Otherwise, my Jesus
is a liar.


57
00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:54.332
So I have talked
to the Texas district attorney


58
00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:58.771
and requested that
Mr. Parker's sentence...


59
00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:03.943
be fair and just...

60
00:06:05.444 --> 00:06:08.346
but also with
the possibility of parole...


61
00:06:11.117 --> 00:06:12.651
and redemption.

You coming or going?

if you come tomorrow--

Samuel.

91
00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:12.091
Get in the car.

92
00:10:13.058 --> 00:10:14.626
[Samuel]
Am I in trouble or something?


93
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.362
Why would you assume
you were in trouble?


94
00:10:16.495 --> 00:10:19.631
Because you haven't picked
me up since I was 13 years old.


95
00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:26.505
Troy Parker
is being released today.

Mm. Five years, right?

97
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:33.545
'Cause you wouldn't testify?

98
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.047
It was
the right thing to do.


99
00:10:35.482 --> 00:10:38.684
Being a pastor don't make you
the expert on what's right.


100
00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:44.957
I just thought
you should know.


101
00:10:46.925 --> 00:10:48.495
Hey, can you gimme
a hand at the church tonight?


102
00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:49.928
[Samuel]
I got homework.


103
00:10:50.062 --> 00:10:51.464
Samuel, I can't do
everything myself.

125
00:12:51.283 --> 00:12:52.818
[Scott] Come on.
You know what they say?


126
00:12:53.318 --> 00:12:55.154
You can take
the cop outta the big city.


127
00:12:55.287 --> 00:12:56.855
What happened?

128
00:12:57.856 --> 00:13:00.225
Was driving by,
saw the truck on fire.


129
00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:01.860
Local fire put it out.

130
00:13:04.464 --> 00:13:05.998
That's when they found--

131
00:13:09.435 --> 00:13:12.204
-Do we know who it is?
-Not yet.


132

Coroner's on their way,

-And they drive slow.

Doesn't explain
the gas though...


140
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.060
or the tracks.

141
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:37.196
[Scott]
Sorry, what's that?


142
00:13:38.096 --> 00:13:40.832
Well, sometimes pickup truck
uses different tires


143
00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:42.602
than a passenger car.

144
00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:45.370
That's a mid-eighties Ford
that's running on LT metrics.

This is P.

That's why mine's origami.

148

There was another car.

149
00:14:00.018 --> 00:14:02.054
Right. But, uh,
which means?


150
00:14:02.187 --> 00:14:03.489
This isn't
where it happened.

Where are you going?

153
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.895
To find out
where it did.


154
00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:12.164
Run the treads.
See where it takes us.


155
00:14:12.297 --> 00:14:13.466
Sure.

156
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.368
I mean, I was gonna do that.
I just-- I--

How was
the service pastor?


160
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:51.504
I-- I probably
should have just called.


161
00:14:53.205 --> 00:14:54.840
I heard you got out.

162
00:14:55.742 --> 00:14:57.309
Yeah, just-- just yesterday.

163
00:15:00.345 --> 00:15:01.780
You came back.

164
00:15:04.417 --> 00:15:06.084
Did you hear
about my mom?


165
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.254
No.

166
00:15:11.023 --> 00:15:12.858
Yeah, she, uh...

167
00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:15.495
she fell sick...

168
00:15:17.397 --> 00:15:19.565
a little over a year ago
and you know,

Home sweet home.
Thanks for the ride.


664
00:50:36.582 --> 00:50:38.049
Yeah, of course.

665
00:50:39.519 --> 00:50:41.554
Hey, you wanna come up?
See the place?


666
00:50:42.287 --> 00:50:43.890
You know, maybe have
a beer or something?


667
00:50:44.022 --> 00:50:46.925
Uh, probably not
a beer, huh?


668
00:50:47.627 --> 00:50:49.294
N-- n-- no. [chuckles]

669
00:50:49.429 --> 00:50:51.229
-Prob-- probably not.
-You like water?


670
00:50:56.268 --> 00:50:58.471
Yeah. Water would be great.

A little--
little small, isn't it?


674
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.295
As long as I can stretch out,
I'm good.


675
00:51:24.831 --> 00:51:28.768
Uh, you didn't wanna
move back with your mom?


676
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:32.538
Um, you know,
me and her...


677
00:51:32.672 --> 00:51:34.973
we're sort of better
with a little distance.


678
00:51:37.677 --> 00:51:38.744
[Marshall] Yeah.

679
00:51:41.046 --> 00:51:42.482
Samuel is the same way.

680
00:51:45.918 --> 00:51:47.687
Parents and kids, right?

681
00:51:49.622 --> 00:51:50.690
[sighs]

682
00:51:54.025 --> 00:51:56.228
I guess
that's why he, uh,


683
00:51:56.361 --> 00:51:58.431
why he wants to leave.

684
00:51:59.832 --> 00:52:01.132
He wants his space.

685
00:52:04.102 --> 00:52:06.104
The truth is,
he's never home


686
00:52:06.238 --> 00:52:07.507
even when he is there...

687
00:52:09.909 --> 00:52:11.176
especially lately.

688
00:52:12.778 --> 00:52:14.045
He thinks I'm--

689
00:52:14.179 --> 00:52:17.583
I'm making
a mistake with you.


690
00:52:19.785 --> 00:52:21.454

692

Lonelier still when
it's your own son.


693
00:52:38.638 --> 00:52:41.607
I've always been
a better pastor than a father.

695
00:52:48.146 --> 00:52:49.415
Yeah, well, he--

696
00:52:50.148 --> 00:52:53.118
he stopped listening to me
a long time ago.


697
00:52:54.987 --> 00:52:57.188
Doesn't mean
you stop trying.


698
00:52:59.659 --> 00:53:01.394
Look, pastor...

699
00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:04.262
keep the faith.

How about you?
What did you do?


717

Homework at Kaitlyn's.

I'm not
asking you to understand...


729

but I need you
to trust me son.


730

Trust you?

He killed her.

I can't.

I never thought
I'd see him again.

It's one thing to-- to forgive
someone from far away.

Nothing.

She died so that
you could save his soul.

I did.

it is your moral obligation

arraigned tomorrow.
