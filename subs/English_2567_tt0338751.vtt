00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.526
Quarantine.

10
00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:49.278
You know the cholera?

11
00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:50.988
Yes, Mother.

12
00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:54.074
You've seen the signs on
the houses where the coloreds live?


13
00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:55.909
Yes, Mother.

14
00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:57.369
You know the typhus?

15
00:01:57.537 --> 00:01:59.579
I do, Mother.

16
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.543
You know what they
can do to you?


17
00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:06.920
Yes, Mother.

18
00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:13.218
You are not safe.

19
00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:23.854
You may be directing this movie,
but what you're asking, we can't do.


20
00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.898
Don't tell me it can't be done.

21
00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:30.819
The gyro forces are too much.
You send these planes into barrel rolls ...


22
00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:34.489
... they won't make it.
- It's the climax of the picture. Make it work.


23
00:02:34.657 --> 00:02:37.159
Decrease the vertical trajectory
if you have to.


24
00:02:37.327 --> 00:02:39.828
A "Le Rhône" rotary
won't stall at 60 degrees.


25
00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:43.582
We're still short two cameras.
We need to cut that sequence down --


26
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.127
We're not cutting. I'll get those cameras.
Set up for rehearsals.


27
00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:50.088
I'm Noah Dietrich.
Your office said I'd find you here.


28
00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:52.382
Dietrich.
You're a man on the come.


29
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.386
I read your résumé, talked to your
references. Know what I'm looking for?


30
00:02:56.554 --> 00:02:59.598
You're looking for a second-in-command
at Hughes Tools.


31
00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:02.517
Someone to oversee
the financial aspects of the business.


32
00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:05.437
I'm looking for somebody to run it
and do a good job.


33
00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:07.898
There's only one thing
you've gotta know.


34
00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.901
My folks, they're gone now.
So it's my money.


35
00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.780
What I do with that money may seem crazy
to those sons of bitches in Houston.


36
00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:18.533
I'm sure it does, but it all makes
good sense to me. You got that?


37
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.494
- Got it.
- Good.


38
00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:23.789
Now, you made, what,
$5200 a year at your last job?


39
00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:27.834
- I'll pay you $10,000.
- I guess I'll be working twice as hard.


40
00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:31.588
You'll be working four times as hard.
I just got you at half price.


41
00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:33.256
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.


42
00:03:33.424 --> 00:03:35.592
You're my voice now.
Make them understand that.


43
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.930
Some of those folks still call me Junior.
You tell them it's "Mr. Hughes" now.


44
00:03:40.098 --> 00:03:42.182
You bet.
So when do we go to Houston?


45
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.644
We don't. Cholera epidemic in 1913.
Two thousand dead.


46
00:03:45.812 --> 00:03:47.854
Whole place is nothing but
pestilential swamp.


47
00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:52.150
Typhus, malaria, cholera, yellow fever.
You name it, they got it.


48
00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:53.777
You see that, Mr. Dietrich?

49
00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:58.824
You are looking at the largest
private air force in the entire world.


50
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.034
What do you think of that, now?

51
00:04:02.453 --> 00:04:03.995
It's your money.

52
00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:06.581
Start them up!

53
00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:36.379
I saw the rough cut of the new
Tod Browning movie, London After Midnight.


54
00:05:36.547 --> 00:05:38.340
Lon Chaney is incredible.

55
00:05:38.508 --> 00:05:40.842
It's his best performance
in a long time.


56
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.345
It's gonna be a big hit.
The cards are great.


57
00:05:43.513 --> 00:05:44.930
It's supposed to be --

58
00:05:45.097 --> 00:05:47.557
Hello, Mr. Mayer.

59
00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:50.727
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Howard Hughes.


60
00:05:50.895 --> 00:05:53.271
I was wondering
if I could have a moment.


61
00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.483
- Oh, Howard Hughes. The airplane picture?
- Exactly.


62
00:05:56.651 --> 00:05:58.985
- I remember.
- Hell's Angels. You heard of it.


63
00:05:59.153 --> 00:06:00.403
- Good.
- Yes.


64
00:06:00.571 --> 00:06:03.365
I was wondering if I could
have a moment of your time.


65
00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:04.824
I need a few cameras.

66
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.662
- Yeah?
- Yeah, two, to be exact.


67
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.625
I bought every camera I could find.
We're shooting our big dogfight sequence.


68
00:06:13.793 --> 00:06:17.212
I need two more. Desperately.
You think MGM could help me out?


69
00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:18.755
With what?

70
00:06:18.923 --> 00:06:21.716
- Cameras.
- Oh, with the actual cam --


71
00:06:21.884 --> 00:06:25.095
We're not usually in the practice
of helping out competition.


72
00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:28.390
- No. No.
- So how many cameras do you have now?


73
00:06:28.558 --> 00:06:29.933
Twenty-four.

74
00:06:32.478 --> 00:06:35.105
You ...?
Wait a minute.


75
00:06:37.358 --> 00:06:39.234
- You have 24 cameras?
- That's right.


76
00:06:39.402 --> 00:06:41.987
- And you need --? You need two more?
- Yeah.


77
00:06:42.154 --> 00:06:45.782
- You don't think you got it with 24?
- No. No, sir.


78
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.577
You know, I think --
I think we've got them all ...


79
00:06:48.744 --> 00:06:51.162
Don't we have them ...?
They're all used, right?


80
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.623
- All 26 of them.
- I only need two, sir.


81
00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:55.667
- Jesus Christ, sonny.
- Howard.


82
00:06:55.835 --> 00:06:58.503
Howard. Let me give you
a little advice, huh?


83
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:00.755
- Take your oil money --
- Drill bits.


84
00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:04.009
All right, take your drill-bit money
and put it in the bank.


85
00:07:04.176 --> 00:07:06.845
If you continue making
the movie the way you are ...


86
00:07:07.013 --> 00:07:09.306
... there isn't gonna be a distributor ...

87
00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:12.434
... you won't find anybody
who wants to see the movie ...


88
00:07:12.602 --> 00:07:15.270
... and you're not gonna have
any more oil money.


89
00:07:15.438 --> 00:07:18.481
So welcome to Hollywood.

90
00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:22.027
Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to remember that, Mr. Mayer.


91
00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:24.029
- Good luck.
- All right.


92
00:07:24.196 --> 00:07:27.365
He needs 26 to make it work?
He's out of his mind.


93
00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:37.459
I looked down at my pants.
It was a strange situation.


94
00:07:39.295 --> 00:07:42.047
Boss.
Scram, love boat, let's go.


95
00:07:43.257 --> 00:07:46.301
- Another soda. You know what I mean.
- Milk. In the bottle.


96
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:49.429
- With the cap still on.
- Okay, what did His Highness say?


97
00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:52.807
Son of a bitch won't part with
a single goddamn camera.


98
00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:55.518
Why don't you try and
make do with what you have.


99
00:07:56.062 --> 00:07:58.855
What I have isn't enough, John,
not for how I see it.


100
00:07:59.023 --> 00:08:00.523
Look.

101
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:04.611
My name depends on this picture.
If it doesn't work, I'm back to Houston ...


102
00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:07.572
... making goddamn drill bits
for the rest of my life.


103
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.908
Can't you do it
with the cameras you have?


104
00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:12.869
You ought to hear about
what's going on with DeMille.


105
00:08:13.037 --> 00:08:17.290
He's shooting his Bible picture.
He's gotta do a crucifixion in Fresno.


106
00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:18.708
Johnny.

107
00:08:18.876 --> 00:08:20.960
- A bunch of tractors --
- Johnny.


108
00:08:21.128 --> 00:08:23.296
- You're a press agent, are you not?
- Yeah.


109
00:08:23.464 --> 00:08:25.590
You're supposed to know
the ins and outs?


110
00:08:25.758 --> 00:08:27.008
- Absolutely.
- Do you?


111
00:08:27.176 --> 00:08:28.426
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:08:28.594 --> 00:08:30.637
Then you leave the big ideas ...

113
00:08:31.263 --> 00:08:33.390
... to me.
- Oh, yeah. Of course, boss.


114
00:08:33.557 --> 00:08:35.308
Cigar, cigarettes, Sen
-Sen?

115
00:08:36.435 --> 00:08:38.603
I thought you were
at the Brown Derby ...


116
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:40.522
... with Trixie. No, Theresa.

117
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.232
- Margaret.
- Margaret. Exactly.


118
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.526
What happened to Margaret?
She lost her --


119
00:08:44.694 --> 00:08:46.236
Thank God that's settled.

120
00:08:46.404 --> 00:08:49.531
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thelma, this is Howard Hughes.


121
00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:53.702
Howard and I were discussing how he
wants me to pull a camera out of my ass.


122
00:08:54.537 --> 00:08:58.331
- Cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.


123
00:09:01.168 --> 00:09:04.462
Boy, you are just hitting
on all six cylinders, aren't you?


124
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.506
My God.

125
00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:09.300
Would you do me
a favor and just ...?


126
00:09:09.468 --> 00:09:12.137
Would you just smile
for me one time? Just once?


127
00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:18.059
Yeah. Yeah. You see,
you got a short upper lip.


128
00:09:18.436 --> 00:09:20.228
Makes for a much nicer smile.

129
00:09:25.401 --> 00:09:28.987
See, I wonder what gives
a beautiful woman like you pleasure.


130
00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:32.824
I mean, say you're just standing
there, right? And I just touch you.


131
00:09:32.992 --> 00:09:34.993
Just -
- Just like this.

132
00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:36.995
With my fingertips.

133
00:09:37.163 --> 00:09:39.372
Do you --?
Do you like that?


134
00:09:40.499 --> 00:09:42.083
Do you?

135
00:09:47.089 --> 00:09:50.133
You see, I wanna learn
what pleases you.


136
00:09:51.343 --> 00:09:54.387
I wanna learn everything about you.

137
00:09:54.555 --> 00:09:56.598
Would you let me do that?

138
00:09:56.766 --> 00:09:58.975
Would you give me that job?

139
00:10:04.106 --> 00:10:06.065
I'm off in a half an hour.

140
00:10:07.777 --> 00:10:10.528
- Well, I'm in room --
- 217.


141
00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:12.614
217.

142
00:10:14.617 --> 00:10:16.493
See you there.

143
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.333
Johnny, get on the horn
to Universal and Warners.


144
00:10:23.501 --> 00:10:25.376
I need two more cameras
by Saturday.


145
00:10:25.544 --> 00:10:28.296
Rent them if you can.
Steal them if you have to.


146
00:10:29.048 --> 00:10:31.132
Absotively, boss.

147
00:10:31.592 --> 00:10:32.842
Absotively.

148
00:10:34.512 --> 00:10:37.263
Rumors coming from a lonely airstrip
out in Van Nuys.


149
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:40.725
Sources whisper that young
Texas industrialist Howard Hughes ...


150
00:10:40.893 --> 00:10:43.311
... won't stop pouring money
into his war epic.


151
00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:44.896
And do we mean epic!

152
00:10:45.064 --> 00:10:47.899
One hundred and thirty-seven pilots,

153
00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:52.445
... 35 cameramen, 2000 extras.
How long will it be before this picture ...


154
00:10:52.613 --> 00:10:54.864
... ends up costing as
much as the real war?


155
00:10:55.032 --> 00:10:57.242
Damn it.
Why the hell do they look so slow?


156
00:10:57.409 --> 00:11:01.037
This isn't what it was like up there.
They look like goddamn models!


157
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.839
Son of a bitch.

158
00:11:12.132 --> 00:11:13.550
Howard?

159
00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:20.014
Without something standing
still behind the planes ...


160
00:11:20.182 --> 00:11:22.767
... we've got no idea
of how fast we're moving.


161
00:11:22.935 --> 00:11:25.770
We got no sense of relative motion.

162
00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:29.607
Call UCLA.
Get me the best meteorologist they got.


163
00:11:29.775 --> 00:11:31.860
You get him here
in an hour, all right?

164
00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:38.032
Hey. You want the good news
or the bad news?


165
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.784
- Bad news, always.
- All right.


166
00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:43.121
We installed the 450 radial.
Struts won't take the vibration.


167
00:11:43.289 --> 00:11:47.125
Minute we fire her up, the struts
start cracking at the attach points.


168
00:11:47.334 --> 00:11:50.086
- Well, what's the good news?
- There isn't any.


169
00:11:50.462 --> 00:11:54.090
Goddamn it, Odie. If the 450's too big,
we figure something else out.


170
00:11:54.258 --> 00:11:57.218
We've done everything.
We've rebuilt her from top to toe.


171
00:11:57.386 --> 00:11:59.178
If we drain the fuel tank ...

172
00:11:59.346 --> 00:12:03.016
... she might make 180 miles per hour.
- I want minimum 200, all right?


173
00:12:03.183 --> 00:12:06.060
I want a date with Theda Bara.
That ain't gonna happen.


174
00:12:06.228 --> 00:12:08.146
Oh, don't be so sure.

175
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.358
If the struts won't sustain the engine
we need, we gotta get rid of the struts.


176
00:12:12.526 --> 00:12:14.611
No, then the top wing falls off.

177
00:12:17.323 --> 00:12:18.865
Then let it.

178
00:12:19.366 --> 00:12:20.825
What?

179
00:12:22.161 --> 00:12:24.162
Who says we need a top wing?

180
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.414
I mean, who says we need anything?

181
00:12:28.584 --> 00:12:31.002
- A monoplane.
- A cantilevered monoplane, right?


182
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.380
They're doing it in France.
To hell with the top wing and struts.


183
00:12:34.548 --> 00:12:36.966
- A 550 Wasp engine.
- One-hundred-octane fuel.


184
00:12:37.134 --> 00:12:40.428
- That would give us a horsepower of what?
- Seven hundred.


185
00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:46.100
We squeeze that to a thousand,
we got the fastest plane ever built.


186
00:12:48.896 --> 00:12:50.438
You know, I've gotta say ...

187
00:12:50.606 --> 00:12:54.317
... we've already spent over $200,000
rebuilding this plane.


188
00:12:55.736 --> 00:12:57.362
To hell with it.

189
00:12:58.489 --> 00:12:59.864
Tear it up, Odie.

190
00:13:00.032 --> 00:13:01.366
Go on.

191
00:13:05.037 --> 00:13:06.371
Well ...

192
00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:13.044
The cumulonimbus formations
about which you speak ...


193
00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:16.631
... that look like ...

194
00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:18.591
Giant breasts full of milk.

195
00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:20.510
I want clouds, damn it.

196
00:13:20.886 --> 00:13:22.470
Yes, clouds ...

197
00:13:22.638 --> 00:13:26.432
... that look like
giant breasts full of milk ...


198
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.144
... cannot exactly be guaranteed
for any particular occasion.


199
00:13:30.312 --> 00:13:32.397
So you might have to ...

200
00:13:33.732 --> 00:13:35.066
To wait.

201
00:13:37.194 --> 00:13:39.112
Then we'll wait.

202
00:13:40.072 --> 00:13:42.407
Look, whatever they pay
you at UCLA ...


203
00:13:42.574 --> 00:13:46.202
... I'm doubling it, all right?
You work for me now. Find some clouds.


204
00:13:47.663 --> 00:13:49.038
Find some clouds.

205
00:13:49.707 --> 00:13:51.457
Find me some clouds!

206
00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:53.835
Welcome to Hell's Angels.

207
00:13:57.047 --> 00:13:58.256
Thank you.

208
00:14:06.932 --> 00:14:10.393
I've been to Chatsworth,
Santa Cruz, Encino, San Diego ...


209
00:14:10.561 --> 00:14:14.439
... Riverside, Van Nuys and Bakersfield.
It has been eight months!


210
00:14:14.606 --> 00:14:16.399
Where are my goddamn clouds, huh?

211
00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:18.901
They move, Mr. Hughes!

212
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:20.403
Clouds move.

213
00:14:20.571 --> 00:14:23.031
- That's what they do. They move!
- You see that?


214
00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:26.909
It is costing me $5,271 a day ...

215
00:14:27.077 --> 00:14:31.456
... to keep those planes on the ground.
You find me some goddamn clouds, huh?


216
00:14:38.922 --> 00:14:40.423
Nice day.

217
00:14:40.883 --> 00:14:42.800
Yeah, very funny.

218
00:14:43.052 --> 00:14:45.887
I got a call from Houston.
They're getting nervous.


219
00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:47.972
Stop showing them the damn bills.

220
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.515
That would be illegal.

221
00:14:49.683 --> 00:14:51.934
Shit, no.
Maybe it's a little bit naughty.


222
00:14:52.102 --> 00:14:55.980
Hughes Tool is incorporated in Texas.
They have to see the bills.


223
00:14:57.357 --> 00:15:00.943
Incorporate a new division out here.
We'll call it Hughes Aircraft.


224
00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:05.656
- Do we need these rivets on the cowling?
- Yeah, or the reverse thrust would rip it off.


225
00:15:05.824 --> 00:15:08.534
They're gonna give me drag.
Do something about that.


226
00:15:08.702 --> 00:15:10.995
- Wind resistance on rivets?
- I want her slippery.


227
00:15:11.163 --> 00:15:14.165
There are tax consequences
to incorporating in California.


228
00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:16.834
- Just take care of it, would you?
- Mr. Hughes!


229
00:15:17.002 --> 00:15:18.795
Oakland!

230
00:15:18.962 --> 00:15:22.006
- We have clouds in Oakland!
- You mean it this time?


231
00:15:22.174 --> 00:15:23.716
Yes!

232
00:15:23.884 --> 00:15:27.011
Goddamn it, yes.
I can promise you.


233
00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:30.431
- Clouds in Oakland.
- All right, don't get all jittery now.


234
00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:34.769
Oakland!

235
00:15:34.937 --> 00:15:38.189
We're going to Oakland!
Oakland.


236
00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:16.978
Down and to the left!

237
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.961
That's perfect!

238
00:16:45.841 --> 00:16:50.261
That's right, Senator George.

239
00:16:50.429 --> 00:16:53.097
Yes, young Howard Hughes
has pulled it off!


240
00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:56.684
After two years, Hell's Angels
has finally finished filming.


241
00:16:56.852 --> 00:16:59.979
There's gonna be one heck
of a wrap party in Hollywood tonight.


242
00:17:00.147 --> 00:17:02.857
The price tag?
A staggering $2 million.


243
00:17:03.025 --> 00:17:05.526
If every human being
in America buys a ticket ...


244
00:17:05.694 --> 00:17:07.445
... he might even make a profit.

245
00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:13.868
First, clouds don't come.

246
00:17:14.036 --> 00:17:16.454
Then planes break down.
Then the planes crash.


247
00:17:18.123 --> 00:17:21.167
We've had everything but
a plague of locusts on this thing.


248
00:17:21.335 --> 00:17:22.710
I mean, you have to admit.

249
00:17:22.878 --> 00:17:26.881
Now, honestly, did you ever think
you'd actually finish the damn thing?


250
00:17:29.092 --> 00:17:30.468
Come with me.

251
00:17:32.387 --> 00:17:35.640
Mama, darling,
if I'm a success in this show ...


252
00:17:35.807 --> 00:17:37.892
... we're gonna move from here.
- Oh, no.


253
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.019
Yes.
We're gonna move up in the Bronx.


254
00:17:40.187 --> 00:17:42.271
Green grass,
a lot of people you know.


255
00:17:42.439 --> 00:17:45.149
The Ginsbergs,
the Guttenbergs and the Goldbergs.


256
00:17:45.317 --> 00:17:47.985
Oh, a whole lot of "bergs."
I don't know them all.


257
00:17:48.612 --> 00:17:52.365
See, this is what the people want.
Silent pictures are yesterday's news.


258
00:17:52.532 --> 00:17:55.534
So I figure we gotta re-shoot
Hell's Angels for sound.


259
00:17:57.955 --> 00:17:59.497
How much of it?

260
00:17:59.665 --> 00:18:01.916
All of it.
Before you ask, I'll tell you.


261
00:18:02.084 --> 00:18:04.961
An additional 1.7 million.
We got that much?


262
00:18:06.088 --> 00:18:09.340
- No!
- Well, we'll make it.


263
00:18:09.508 --> 00:18:11.259
Take care of that, would you?

264
00:18:11.426 --> 00:18:12.760
Now, get this.

265
00:18:22.854 --> 00:18:25.022
In the halls of 7000 Romaine ...

266
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.608
... it goes on day after day,
month after month.


267
00:18:27.776 --> 00:18:31.487
Howard Hughes is now editing
some 25 miles of film.


268
00:18:32.864 --> 00:18:37.493
Heck, I say release it now and give
the world its first 560-hour movie.


269
00:18:37.661 --> 00:18:41.914
Pat, Mr. Hughes needs this reel
in the projection room right now!


270
00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:44.375
Enough is enough, Mr. Hughes.

271
00:18:44.543 --> 00:18:47.753
Are you ever gonna let us
actually see this epic of yours?


272
00:18:47.921 --> 00:18:49.422
Hurry up!

273
00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:11.819
- Who is it?
- Noah.


274
00:19:11.987 --> 00:19:13.654
Come on in.

275
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.825
I've been on the phone
to Houston for three hours.


276
00:19:17.993 --> 00:19:20.995
- We're fixing every goddamn book we have.
- Wait, wait.


277
00:19:21.913 --> 00:19:25.333
Yeah. Run reel 10 again.
I think we're duplicating a shot here.


278
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.337
And tell Jimmy I want

279
00:19:29.504 --> 00:19:32.381
Medium chips,
none too close to the outside.


280
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:34.050
Got it?

281
00:19:34.217 --> 00:19:36.552
You remember
that goddamn shot from reel 10?


282
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.305
No. I don't remember
anything from reel 10.


283
00:19:39.473 --> 00:19:41.640
I don't know what reel 10 is.

284
00:19:41.808 --> 00:19:45.102
I'm a businessman, Howard.
And so are you.


285
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.063
Now, look.

286
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.689
This has been a great ride.

287
00:19:48.857 --> 00:19:50.775
We've had a hell
of a lot of fun.

288
00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:54.862
But you're losing
$25,000 a day doing this.


289
00:19:55.155 --> 00:19:57.073
Every day.

290
00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:05.456
So, what are my options?

291
00:20:07.042 --> 00:20:09.794
Well, this time I don't know
that you have any.


292
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:12.380
I'm afraid you gotta close it down.

293
00:20:13.131 --> 00:20:14.757
Dig your way out.

294
00:20:21.431 --> 00:20:23.432
I'm sorry, Howard.

295
00:20:23.975 --> 00:20:25.810
I truly am.

296
00:20:33.151 --> 00:20:34.777
Reel 10, Mr. Hughes.

297
00:20:40.826 --> 00:20:42.827
Mortgage Tool Co.

298
00:20:43.745 --> 00:20:48.833
- Every asset. You heard me.
- If you do that, you could lose everything.


299
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.584
Well, I won't.

300
00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:55.172
I won't.

301
00:20:56.675 --> 00:20:58.467
All right.

302
00:20:59.678 --> 00:21:01.303
I'll get into it.

303
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:04.223
Thanks, Noah.

304
00:21:39.342 --> 00:21:43.053
More than half a million souls lining
the curb of Hollywood Boulevard.


305
00:21:43.221 --> 00:21:44.889
Look at the automobiles!

306
00:21:45.056 --> 00:21:48.893
There are 45,000 cars here,
making it the greatest traffic jam ever seen.


307
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.479
Howard Hughes must have
a lump in his throat.


308
00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:55.733
Six months after the stock market crashes
and after three pilots' deaths ...


309
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:58.903
... he's finally unveiling his
$4 million baby doll.


310
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.365
It's the most expensive movie ever made.
Nothing five-and-dime for our Mr. Hughes.


311
00:22:03.533 --> 00:22:06.827
Nothing like tonight has ever been
seen before, and I can say ...


312
00:22:06.995 --> 00:22:08.662
... it will never be seen again.

313
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.833
Five hundred thousand people are crowding
the streets to get a glimpse of the stars.


314
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:15.711
Three companies of Marines
were called to assist ...


315
00:22:15.879 --> 00:22:19.298
... the 250 special police who are
handling this enormous crowd --


316
00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.008
This is an industry town.

317
00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:24.094
And nobody but nobody
makes a movie outside a studio.


318
00:22:24.262 --> 00:22:27.765
Some Hollywood insiders over
at the Brown Derby may be laughing ...


319
00:22:27.933 --> 00:22:29.391
And now, I think ...

320
00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:32.394
Yes, yes, I can see
Mr. Hughes' car arriving now.


321
00:22:32.562 --> 00:22:35.523
Mr. Hughes escorts
the lovely starlet Jean Harlow.


322
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.693
He discovered her for this picture,
and we think her platinum blond locks ...


323
00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:44.114
... and hot-jazz, baby-doll style
are gonna make her a big star.


324
00:22:53.083 --> 00:22:55.376
Howard! Howard!

325
00:23:01.925 --> 00:23:03.801
Over here!

326
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.603
- This way, boss. Right over there.
- Mr. Hughes, how about a word?


327
00:23:14.813 --> 00:23:17.273
Big night for you, Mr. Hughes.

328
00:23:19.192 --> 00:23:21.819
Big night for you tonight.

329
00:23:21.987 --> 00:23:24.321
Very big. Very big.

330
00:23:24.489 --> 00:23:28.200
Tell us what it was like
making this fabulous picture.


331
00:23:30.036 --> 00:23:31.829
Yes.

332
00:23:31.997 --> 00:23:33.372
Yeah.

333
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.166
So 4 million clams
from your own pocket.


334
00:23:36.334 --> 00:23:38.002
Nervous how the flick will fly?

335
00:23:41.548 --> 00:23:44.842
Big night. You enjoy the show.

336
00:23:45.343 --> 00:23:50.723
Yes, well, let me present the feminine
star of this spectacle, Hell's Angels ...


337
00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.517
... Miss Jean Harlow.
- Thank you.


338
00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:56.645
I would like to use this occasion
to thank Mr. Hughes ...


339
00:23:56.813 --> 00:24:00.107
... for the opportunity he gave me.
Thank you.


340
00:24:00.275 --> 00:24:03.652
Thank you!
Now I'd like to ask Roscoe Arbuckle ...


341
00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.780
... to introduce
his pet lion cub, Gilmore.


342
00:24:06.948 --> 00:24:09.617
What's the matter with you?
Can't remember my name?


343
00:24:09.784 --> 00:24:13.787
I'm sorry. Roscoe Turner,
and this would be Gilmore.


344
00:24:56.915 --> 00:24:58.582
It's going! It's going!

345
00:25:00.251 --> 00:25:03.671
Murder! That's what this
dirty, rotten politician war is, murder!


346
00:25:03.838 --> 00:25:05.297
You know it as well as I do.

347
00:25:43.086 --> 00:25:44.670
Stand up, slim, take a bow.

348
00:25:58.309 --> 00:26:00.519
Reel four played too long.
Too many coughs.


349
00:26:00.687 --> 00:26:04.648
Get the team out of the party and
to the office. I wanna cut a few shots.


350
00:26:04.816 --> 00:26:07.067
Oh, find Glenn.
Somebody write this down.


351
00:26:07.235 --> 00:26:08.485
Flush rivets.
Got that?


352
00:26:08.653 --> 00:26:10.320
- Flush rivets.
- Flush rivets.


353
00:26:10.488 --> 00:26:12.030
Lickety-split, boss.

354
00:26:12.282 --> 00:26:13.907
Here he is! Here he is!

355
00:26:15.994 --> 00:26:17.870
Variety says, "This one won't miss!"

356
00:26:18.037 --> 00:26:21.331
- Magnificently photographed!
- Awesome beyond description!


357
00:26:21.499 --> 00:26:25.085
The most extraordinary output
to emerge from a motion-picture studio.


358
00:26:25.253 --> 00:26:28.172
Not for a long time have I seen
anything as enthralling.


359
00:26:28.339 --> 00:26:31.383
It costs 4 million dollars
and has 4 million thrills!


360
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:33.844
- Majestically ...
- Most epic picture of its time!


361
00:27:29.317 --> 00:27:32.277
A lighter shade. I don't want
to look like Boris Karloff.


362
00:27:32.445 --> 00:27:34.071
If you know what I mean.

363
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.910
I read in the magazines
that you play golf.


364
00:27:40.078 --> 00:27:41.745
On occasion.

365
00:27:41.913 --> 00:27:44.164
Well, how about nine holes?

366
00:27:46.251 --> 00:27:48.418
Now, Mr. Hughes?

367
00:27:49.087 --> 00:27:51.839
If it would be convenient, Miss Hepburn.

368
00:28:14.404 --> 00:28:17.865
You're not extending
enough on your follow-through.


369
00:28:18.032 --> 00:28:20.951
Follow-through
is everything in golf, just like life.


370
00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:22.452
Don't you find?

371
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.621
Saw your Scarface picture.

372
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:26.123
- Violent.
- Realistic.


373
00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:28.625
Movies are movies, Howard.
Not life.


374
00:28:28.793 --> 00:28:30.460
Now the stage.

375
00:28:30.628 --> 00:28:31.879
The stage is real.

376
00:28:32.046 --> 00:28:36.049
Real flesh and blood. Human beings
right out there in front of you, buster.


377
00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:39.177
Can't look away. Can't munch popcorn.
That would be rude.


378
00:28:39.345 --> 00:28:40.637
Do you like the theater?

379
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.432
- No.
- Oh, I adore the theater.


380
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.767
Only alive on-stage.
I'll teach you.


381
00:28:45.935 --> 00:28:49.855
We'll see some Ibsen. If the Republicans
haven't outlawed him by now.


382
00:28:50.023 --> 00:28:53.066
You're not a Republican, are you?
How did you vote in '32?


383
00:28:53.234 --> 00:28:56.695
- Well, I didn't.
- You must! It's your sacred franchise.


384
00:29:00.575 --> 00:29:03.327
Heard you were wooing Ginger Rogers.
What about that?


385
00:29:03.494 --> 00:29:05.829
She's just a friend.

386
00:29:05.997 --> 00:29:07.706
Men can't be friends with women.

387
00:29:07.874 --> 00:29:09.958
They must possess them
or leave them be.


388
00:29:10.126 --> 00:29:13.253
It's a primitive urge from caveman days.
It's all in Darwin.


389
00:29:13.421 --> 00:29:18.759
Hunt the flesh, kill the flesh, eat the flesh.
That's the male sex all over.


390
00:29:19.427 --> 00:29:20.802
Excuse me?

391
00:29:21.596 --> 00:29:24.598
Well, if you're deaf,
you must own up to it.


392
00:29:24.849 --> 00:29:26.808
Get a hearing aid.
Or see my father.


393
00:29:26.976 --> 00:29:30.646
He's a urologist, but it's all tied up
inside the body, don't you find?


394
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.439
Me, I keep healthy.

395
00:29:32.607 --> 00:29:34.733
I take seven showers a day
to keep clean.


396
00:29:34.901 --> 00:29:38.236
Also because I am what's so
vulgarly referred to as "outdoorsy."


397
00:29:38.404 --> 00:29:42.407
I'm not outdoorsy.
I'm athletic. I sweat.


398
00:29:42.575 --> 00:29:45.369
There it is.
Now we both know the sordid truth.


399
00:29:45.536 --> 00:29:47.996
I sweat and you're deaf.

400
00:29:48.164 --> 00:29:51.041
Aren't we a fine pair of misfits?

401
00:29:54.587 --> 00:29:56.463
Three.

402
00:30:04.013 --> 00:30:05.847
Noble effort.

403
00:30:08.226 --> 00:30:10.894
So I suppose you're
wooing me now?


404
00:30:11.562 --> 00:30:13.563
Oh, well.

405
00:30:32.625 --> 00:30:34.126
Not enough.

406
00:30:34.711 --> 00:30:37.754
Not enough.
These rivets have to be completely flush.


407
00:30:37.922 --> 00:30:40.799
I want every screw and joint countersunk.

408
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.844
I want no wind resistance
on the fuselage.


409
00:30:44.012 --> 00:30:46.304
She has got to be clean, Odie.

410
00:30:46.472 --> 00:30:48.265
- Clean. Understand?
- Okay, Howard.


411
00:30:48.433 --> 00:30:50.225
I don't know
what else to tell you.


412
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:54.855
- What do you got for me?
- The thing is, TWA needs a new plane.


413
00:30:55.023 --> 00:30:57.649
- A modern plane.
- Oh, yeah? What kind of plane?


414
00:30:57.817 --> 00:31:00.068
Okay. The DC-3 has 21 daytime seats ...

415
00:31:00.236 --> 00:31:02.654
... and 14 overnight berths.
- Something bigger?


416
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.366
Try 50 seats with
a ceiling of 12,000 feet.


417
00:31:06.534 --> 00:31:08.785
No. No, 20,000.

418
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.288
Think about it.
What does 20,000 feet give you?


419
00:31:11.456 --> 00:31:14.041
- Less turbulence.
- Because it's above the weather.


420
00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:16.585
Jack, we wanna fly
above the weather.


421
00:31:16.753 --> 00:31:20.297
Only 1 percent of the American population
has set foot on an airliner.


422
00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:23.258
Why? Because they're scared to death.
They should be.


423
00:31:23.426 --> 00:31:26.011
I mean, 7000 feet is bumpy as shit.
You know that.


424
00:31:26.179 --> 00:31:28.680
We build a plane
that flies above the weather ...


425
00:31:28.848 --> 00:31:32.642
... we could get every man, woman
and child in this country to feel safe.


426
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:37.314
An airplane with the ability to fly into
the sub-stratosphere across the country.


427
00:31:37.482 --> 00:31:39.316
Across the world.

428
00:31:39.484 --> 00:31:41.568
Now that is the future.

429
00:31:41.986 --> 00:31:43.236
- You with me?
- Yeah.


430
00:31:43.404 --> 00:31:47.324
I don't wanna get into this
if your board doesn't have the balls for it.


431
00:31:47.492 --> 00:31:49.826
- Would they support us?
- I don't know.


432
00:31:49.994 --> 00:31:52.204
- What's your financial picture?
- Not great.


433
00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:54.539
- Last year's deficit?
- 770,000.


434
00:31:54.707 --> 00:31:57.417
- What's it selling at?
- About 8 dollars a share.


435
00:31:57.585 --> 00:31:59.336
That's the lowest it's been, huh?

436
00:32:01.297 --> 00:32:02.756
I could do that.

437
00:32:02.924 --> 00:32:04.424
- Do what?
- Buy it.


438
00:32:04.592 --> 00:32:07.260
- You wanna buy the airline?
- For crying out loud ...


439
00:32:07.428 --> 00:32:11.348
... we don't want pencil pushers getting
in the way of us making our plane.


440
00:32:11.516 --> 00:32:15.352
Give me brass tacks, now. What does
controlling interest in TWA cost me?


441
00:32:16.354 --> 00:32:17.771
Call it 15 million.

442
00:32:20.191 --> 00:32:22.359
That is a chunk of change, huh?

443
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.614
You call Noah Dietrich.

444
00:32:27.782 --> 00:32:29.741
You have him start buying.

445
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:31.201
Howard, hold on.

446
00:32:31.369 --> 00:32:34.371
Are you sure?
You wanna think about it for five minutes?


447
00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:38.375
Hell, Jack, I got a tiger by the tail here.
I ain't gonna let it go.


448
00:32:47.218 --> 00:32:48.927
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

449
00:32:49.095 --> 00:32:51.471
Welcome. Your table is ready.

450
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.182
How goes the aviation?

451
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.310
- Oh, just fine, Pete.
- I'm so glad.


452
00:32:59.647 --> 00:33:00.981
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

453
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:02.399
- Madame.
- It's "miss."


454
00:33:02.567 --> 00:33:04.985
Miss. The usual, Mr. Hughes?

455
00:33:05.153 --> 00:33:07.279
- Please.
- May I recommend for the lady ...


456
00:33:07.446 --> 00:33:10.949
... our clementine soup followed
by roast duck with currant glaze ...


457
00:33:11.117 --> 00:33:14.077
... and poached pears in rose sauce.
It's truly divine.


458
00:33:14.245 --> 00:33:15.745
Yeah. That sounds fine.

459
00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:20.667
Your kind of joint, is it?

460
00:33:21.794 --> 00:33:23.378
Wouldn't have thought.

461
00:33:23.546 --> 00:33:26.756
They're open late.
I go to a hot-dog stand on "La Cienega" too.


462
00:33:26.924 --> 00:33:29.593
- They're open till about 4.
- Are they?


463
00:33:31.596 --> 00:33:33.430
How marvelous.

464
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.947
Howard! Howard!

465
00:33:51.908 --> 00:33:54.659
Hi! Son of a gun.

466
00:33:54.827 --> 00:33:58.663
Kate, this is Johnny Meyer.
I suppose you could call him my press agent.


467
00:33:58.831 --> 00:34:01.124
- Pleased to meet you. Loved Alice Adams.
- You're too kind.


468
00:34:01.292 --> 00:34:03.960
- I'm sure you know Errol, right?
- Mr. Flynn. Yes.


469
00:34:04.128 --> 00:34:09.007
Kate. Kate. Kate of the clenched-jawed
Hepburns. Enchanting as always.


470
00:34:09.175 --> 00:34:11.885
You should use Lux on your hands,
by the way. I do.


471
00:34:12.053 --> 00:34:14.221
You and Howard
ought to cook up a picture.


472
00:34:14.388 --> 00:34:16.932
Co-star with Errol.
I could sell that in spades.


473
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:19.309
That would be marvelous. Howard?

474
00:34:19.894 --> 00:34:23.647
I think not.
Don't you read Variety, Mr. Meyer?


475
00:34:23.814 --> 00:34:27.484
Well, I'm box-office poison.
I'm on the outs, the skids, the doldrums.


476
00:34:27.652 --> 00:34:31.029
Washed-up, day-old fish
not worth the eating, so they tell me.


477
00:34:31.197 --> 00:34:35.033
Hell with them. Hell with them, my dear.
Soulless pricks to a man, right?


478
00:34:35.201 --> 00:34:39.246
Johnny tells me you're thinking about
doing a Western, of all goddamn things.


479
00:34:43.334 --> 00:34:46.086
Are you making a Western, Howard?

480
00:34:46.295 --> 00:34:49.047
Yeah. Making a Western.
I'm gonna call it The Outlaw.


481
00:34:49.215 --> 00:34:51.383
Yeah. And you know
what it's about? S-E-X.


482
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:54.261
- It's all about S-E-X.
- It's a Western.


483
00:34:54.428 --> 00:34:57.347
You can't have fornication in a Western.
It isn't done.


484
00:34:57.515 --> 00:34:59.307
It's not real sex, it's movie sex.

485
00:34:59.475 --> 00:35:03.144
What Scarface did for the gangster picture,
The Outlaw will do for the Western.


486
00:35:03.312 --> 00:35:06.189
Put the sex and guts and blood
up there on the screen.


487
00:35:06.357 --> 00:35:08.358
- Have you seen my cigarettes?
- Don't mind us.


488
00:35:08.526 --> 00:35:11.945
New York cut steak, 12 peas,
bottle of milk with the cap on.


489
00:35:12.113 --> 00:35:15.365
- You can't afford your own cigarettes?
- Jack has all my money.


490
00:35:15.533 --> 00:35:19.828
I hope your food isn't getting cold
at your table somewhere or something.


491
00:35:19.996 --> 00:35:22.289
No, no. We're here all night.
Don't worry.


492
00:35:22.456 --> 00:35:28.003
Now, Howard. Now, Howard. If you're
seriously talking about putting carnality ...


493
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:32.841
... back on the silver screen, you must swear
to let me in on the casting session.


494
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.849
- I have an eye for talent. Isn't that right?
- You ought to give up prancing in tights ...


495
00:35:41.017 --> 00:35:44.602
... be a talent scout.
- That prancing paid for my new yacht.


496
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:48.231
You must all come sailing with me.
Catalina. What do you say?


497
00:35:48.399 --> 00:35:51.568
- Catalina. Sounds grand. Yeah.
- I've even managed to coax ...


498
00:35:51.736 --> 00:35:55.613
... the luscious Miss De Havilland
and her equally luscious sister to come.


499
00:35:55.781 --> 00:36:00.660
Though I fear their mother will insist on
coming, to preserve their questionable virtue.


500
00:36:00.828 --> 00:36:05.040
We shall assault these twin monuments
of pristine Britannic beauty nonetheless.


501
00:36:05.207 --> 00:36:07.250
- What do you say, Howard?
- Yeah?


502
00:36:07.668 --> 00:36:09.836
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?


503
00:36:14.133 --> 00:36:15.425
I gotta go.

504
00:36:16.302 --> 00:36:19.846
If you'll excuse us, we have --
We have to be somewhere.


505
00:36:20.181 --> 00:36:22.640
You are somewhere, Howard,
you madman.


506
00:36:22.808 --> 00:36:25.852
- Somewhere else. Excuse us.
- Charmed, gentlemen.


507
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.647
Do help yourself to the poached pears.
I hear they're divine.


508
00:36:30.274 --> 00:36:33.068
Well. Howard Hughes,
ladies and gentlemen.


509
00:36:33.944 --> 00:36:35.278
Was that meant for me?

510
00:36:35.446 --> 00:36:38.782
My hero. God, all that
Hollywood talk bores me silly.


511
00:36:38.949 --> 00:36:41.951
As if there aren't more important things,
like Mussolini.


512
00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:46.039
- Where are we going, by the way?
- Do you feel like a little adventure?


513
00:36:46.207 --> 00:36:48.124
Do your worst, Mr. Hughes.

514
00:36:48.292 --> 00:36:52.504
- Think you own this place, you limey bastard?
- I'm a Tasmanian bastard, you prick.


515
00:36:52.671 --> 00:36:55.090
- Thataway, Errol.
- Let me at him!


516
00:37:28.666 --> 00:37:31.376
That's Mr. Mayer's house right there.

517
00:37:31.544 --> 00:37:33.461
Do you know where Jack Warner lives?

518
00:37:42.721 --> 00:37:46.516
- What's that on the steering wheel?
- Cellophane.


519
00:37:46.684 --> 00:37:50.562
If you had any idea of the crap
that people carry around on their hands.


520
00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:52.730
What kind of crap?

521
00:37:53.441 --> 00:37:55.108
You don't wanna know.

522
00:38:00.364 --> 00:38:02.323
Hold on to the wheel for a bit.

523
00:38:10.374 --> 00:38:13.543
That's too hard. Relax your hand.
Relax your hand.


524
00:38:19.216 --> 00:38:24.179
You see, you gotta feel the vibration
of the engine through your fingertips.


525
00:38:24.346 --> 00:38:27.390
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.


526
00:38:30.019 --> 00:38:31.686
Well, that's good.

527
00:38:32.313 --> 00:38:34.022
Golly!

528
00:38:38.402 --> 00:38:40.236
Well, she's all yours.

529
00:38:40.446 --> 00:38:44.115
- Where are you going?!
- I think there's some milk back here.


530
00:38:45.117 --> 00:38:47.911
- You just keep us steady, now.
- All right.


531
00:39:06.931 --> 00:39:08.765
- Howard.
- Yeah?


532
00:39:08.933 --> 00:39:11.893
There's a rather alarming mountain
heading our way.


533
00:39:12.061 --> 00:39:14.270
Pull back on the wheel a smidge.
Go on.


534
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:21.694
Golly!

535
00:39:27.243 --> 00:39:32.413
I don't think I've ever met someone
who actually uses the word "golly."


536
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:42.131
You all right?
Do you want me to take over?


537
00:39:42.299 --> 00:39:44.300
Just when I'm getting the hang of it?

538
00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.351
- You want some milk?
- Oh, please.


539
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:17.500
Utterly smashing!
We'll do it again.


540
00:40:17.668 --> 00:40:20.837
I'm free Wednesday.
It's a little early for golf, though.


541
00:40:21.005 --> 00:40:23.298
Oh, no, no. I live right there.

542
00:40:23.799 --> 00:40:26.342
- Feel like a drink?
- Lead on.


543
00:40:27.553 --> 00:40:30.763
Now, that makes
for a challenging par four.


544
00:40:31.015 --> 00:40:34.684
My decorator
picked out the wallpaper and such.


545
00:40:35.352 --> 00:40:37.395
He's queer as a bedbug.

546
00:40:37.563 --> 00:40:40.315
But I just hate this room.

547
00:40:40.608 --> 00:40:42.442
Gives me the willies.

548
00:40:42.943 --> 00:40:47.030
Like I'm about to be swallowed up
by the latest issue of Town & Country.


549
00:40:55.706 --> 00:40:57.457
What room do you like?

550
00:40:58.709 --> 00:41:00.209
My study.

551
00:41:02.588 --> 00:41:04.255
Take me there.

552
00:41:20.606 --> 00:41:23.650
You are the tallest woman I know.

553
00:41:24.568 --> 00:41:28.696
And all sharp elbows and knees.
Beware.


554
00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.263
Will you fly me to work tomorrow?

555
00:41:56.892 --> 00:41:59.102
It is tomorrow.

556
00:42:51.864 --> 00:42:55.658
Keep your eye on the fuel. She's got
a minimum to keep her weight down.


557
00:42:55.826 --> 00:42:58.828
Two runs. That's it.
After that, you're flying on vapors.


558
00:42:58.996 --> 00:43:01.789
And then you crash and you die.
Give her easy flying.


559
00:43:01.957 --> 00:43:05.251
Don't worry about speed
and don't think about the record today.


560
00:43:05.419 --> 00:43:08.880
I wish you'd let someone else take her.
You've got 20 test pilots.


561
00:43:09.047 --> 00:43:13.384
Hell, why should I let someone else
have all the fun? See you in a bit.


562
00:43:34.364 --> 00:43:36.115
Contact!

563
00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:06.956
339.

564
00:45:09.084 --> 00:45:10.960
Goddamn!

565
00:45:32.649 --> 00:45:34.191
347.

566
00:45:35.652 --> 00:45:36.944
Son of a bitch!

567
00:46:09.311 --> 00:46:11.854
- 352.
- 352!


568
00:46:13.106 --> 00:46:14.357
Good girl.

569
00:46:24.117 --> 00:46:25.826
Damn it!

570
00:46:29.623 --> 00:46:31.749
Goddamn it!

571
00:46:32.209 --> 00:46:34.418
- Oh, God!
- There goes our meal ticket.


572
00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:36.087
Come on!

573
00:47:16.253 --> 00:47:17.670
Howard!

574
00:47:17.838 --> 00:47:20.006
- Howard!
- How did we do?


575
00:47:21.091 --> 00:47:23.426
352 on the last run.

576
00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:26.846
She'll go faster.

577
00:47:27.431 --> 00:47:29.056
Country mouse!

578
00:47:29.808 --> 00:47:33.227
- Kate! Katie!
- Upstairs, city mouse.


579
00:47:36.314 --> 00:47:39.233
Hello.
Good Lord, what happened to you?


580
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:41.610
Oh, nothing. A hard landing.
I cut my foot.


581
00:47:41.778 --> 00:47:44.822
Sit down. I'll take care of it.
You tell me everything.


582
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:48.826
You cannot imagine what it was like, Katie.
You cannot imagine the speed.


583
00:47:48.994 --> 00:47:52.163
- She was like a winged bullet up there.
- What did she make?


584
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:56.500
Oh, around 352.

585
00:48:03.467 --> 00:48:04.967
You did it!

586
00:48:06.303 --> 00:48:08.137
Fastest man on the planet.

587
00:48:08.305 --> 00:48:11.557
Hot dog! I'm so proud of you.

588
00:48:11.725 --> 00:48:13.726
- She did it, baby.
- You knew she would.


589
00:48:13.894 --> 00:48:16.854
Oh, she was fine. 
She was just fine.

590
00:48:18.065 --> 00:48:19.648
Now let me see your foot.

591
00:48:19.858 --> 00:48:21.150
Yeah.

592
00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.446
- Good God! You're covered in blood.
- Oh, no. That's just beet juice.


593
00:48:25.614 --> 00:48:27.782
- I crashed into a beet field.
- What?


594
00:48:27.949 --> 00:48:30.159
Yeah, I crashed in a beet field.

595
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.456
Let me get you cleaned up.

596
00:48:36.458 --> 00:48:41.003
- Heavens, what is this? Electrical tape?
- Yeah. Odie just sort of slammed it on there.


597
00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:47.051
But all I could think about
was getting home to see you.


598
00:48:51.765 --> 00:48:54.642
I am so proud of you.

599
00:48:59.189 --> 00:49:01.524
Now, this is gonna sting a little bit.

600
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:05.528
Oh, this is useless.
Come to the bathroom.


601
00:49:06.738 --> 00:49:09.615
- Don't get beet juice on the carpet.
- I won't, I won't.


602
00:49:09.783 --> 00:49:12.451
- Too hot!
- Don't be a baby.


603
00:49:14.121 --> 00:49:16.956
Was the press there?

604
00:49:17.874 --> 00:49:19.166
Some.

605
00:49:19.376 --> 00:49:24.505
But they're calling everyone.
Should be on the wires by now.


606
00:49:33.098 --> 00:49:34.682
What is it?

607
00:49:37.394 --> 00:49:38.978
Kate?

608
00:49:42.232 --> 00:49:45.317
I've been famous,
for better or worse ...


609
00:49:45.861 --> 00:49:47.820
... for a long time now ...

610
00:49:47.988 --> 00:49:52.324
... and I wonder if
you know what it ...

611
00:49:52.951 --> 00:49:54.743
... really means.

612
00:49:55.912 --> 00:49:59.039
Yeah. I had my fair share
of press on Hell's Angels.


613
00:49:59.791 --> 00:50:01.584
I'm used to it.

614
00:50:03.545 --> 00:50:05.254
Are you?

615
00:50:08.925 --> 00:50:10.676
Howard, we're ...

616
00:50:13.597 --> 00:50:16.056
We're not like everyone else.

617
00:50:18.059 --> 00:50:22.980
Too many acute angles.
Too many eccentricities.


618
00:50:23.773 --> 00:50:26.609
We have to be
very careful not to ...

619
00:50:27.944 --> 00:50:31.780
... let people in,
or they'll make us into freaks.


620
00:50:32.949 --> 00:50:37.536
Kate, they can't get in here.
We're safe.


621
00:50:39.247 --> 00:50:41.123
They can always get in.

622
00:50:43.293 --> 00:50:46.712
When my brother killed himself ...

623
00:50:47.881 --> 00:50:50.466
... there were photographers
at the funeral.


624
00:50:51.676 --> 00:50:53.928
There's no decency to it.

625
00:51:06.358 --> 00:51:08.442
You know, sometimes I ...

626
00:51:12.155 --> 00:51:14.323
I get these feelings, Katie.

627
00:51:19.329 --> 00:51:21.872
I get these ideas, these ...

628
00:51:24.709 --> 00:51:27.336
... crazy ideas about ...

629
00:51:29.756 --> 00:51:32.132
... things that may not ...

630
00:51:33.385 --> 00:51:36.262
Things that may not really be there.

631
00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:38.472
Yeah.

632
00:51:45.146 --> 00:51:47.898
Sometimes I truly fear that I'm ...

633
00:51:49.943 --> 00:51:51.902
... losing my mind.

634
00:51:59.494 --> 00:52:01.370
And if I did, it would ...

635
00:52:04.457 --> 00:52:06.834
It'd be like flying blind.

636
00:52:14.968 --> 00:52:16.635
You understand?

637
00:52:20.807 --> 00:52:23.600
You taught me to fly, Howard.

638
00:52:26.563 --> 00:52:28.564
I'll take the wheel.

639
00:52:44.497 --> 00:52:48.542
Smashing all records, Howard Hughes
outdoes Jules Verne's wildest dreams.


640
00:52:48.835 --> 00:52:52.087
Around the world from New York
to New York in four days.


641
00:52:52.255 --> 00:52:55.215
Even beating Wiley Post's mark
by over three days.


642
00:52:55.383 --> 00:52:58.594
New aviation history is written
when his Lockheed monoplane ...


643
00:52:58.762 --> 00:53:01.764
... returns swiftly and safely.
A daring aviator.


644
00:53:02.223 --> 00:53:04.892
A true pioneer of the world's airways.

645
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:09.063
From New York to Paris, he cuts Lindbergh's
time in half. Then on to Moscow.


646
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:13.776
Thirty-five hours out of New York,
he roars across Siberia's trackless wastes.


647
00:53:13.943 --> 00:53:18.614
Sixty hours out of New York, he heads
for Alaska, most hazardous hop of all.


648
00:53:18.782 --> 00:53:21.158
Continuing the terrific pace,
he comes home ...


649
00:53:21.326 --> 00:53:23.660
... bringing new laurels
to American aviation.


650
00:53:24.996 --> 00:53:28.290
Howard Hughes and his crew
may find more worlds to conquer --


651
00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:39.635
You won't believe this. It just came over the
wires. Hughes has bought control of TWA.


652
00:53:42.389 --> 00:53:45.265
I thought Mr. Hughes
was flying around the world.


653
00:53:45.475 --> 00:53:48.852
Apparently he did it while he was flying,
over the radio.


654
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:59.363
I have heard some disquieting rumors
about Mr. Hughes.


655
00:54:00.949 --> 00:54:04.368
I'd like to know everything
there is to know about Mr. Hughes.


656
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:09.039
I'd like you to
attend to that for me.

657
00:54:10.041 --> 00:54:11.667
Thoroughly.

658
00:54:12.252 --> 00:54:14.670
The Pantages is glittering tonight.

659
00:54:14.838 --> 00:54:17.673
- Howard!
- Right over here. This way, over to the left.


660
00:54:17.841 --> 00:54:20.509
- Mr. Hughes, how was your flight?
- Miss Hepburn!


661
00:54:20.677 --> 00:54:23.345
- When are you gonna name the day?
- Raise your head.


662
00:54:23.513 --> 00:54:25.681
What's the next movie?
Give us the scoop.


663
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:28.517
Right here. How many more
records are you gonna set?


664
00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:32.020
Right over here. Come on.
Give us a smile. It won't kill you.


665
00:54:32.188 --> 00:54:34.064
- Howard, this way.
- Beautiful.


666
00:54:34.232 --> 00:54:36.733
Over here, over here, Mr. Hughes.

667
00:54:36.901 --> 00:54:39.361
When are you gonna fly
around the world again?


668
00:54:39.529 --> 00:54:43.532
You gonna fly with Kate next time?
Did you get lonely without her?


669
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.744
- Talk to Lindbergh about your flight yet?
- Where's Linda Darnell tonight?


670
00:54:47.912 --> 00:54:51.206
- Please, Mr. Hughes.
- Right here. Right here, Mr. Hughes.


671
00:54:51.374 --> 00:54:53.876
Are you trying to be more famous
than Lindbergh?


672
00:54:54.586 --> 00:54:58.338
You know,
fame is supposed to be my turf.


673
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.217
L.B.!

674
00:55:04.846 --> 00:55:08.223
If you don't get more distinguished
every time I see you.


675
00:55:08.391 --> 00:55:10.392
You look so beautiful.

676
00:55:18.193 --> 00:55:19.818
Is that true?

677
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.496
Don't worry about it, Howard.

678
00:55:30.663 --> 00:55:34.333
She's just working the room.
It's her job, baby.


679
00:55:37.378 --> 00:55:41.173
Sultry Southern tigress Ava Gardner
dazzles the room tonight.


680
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:43.592
She's the newest star
in the MGM galaxy.


681
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:47.387
And believe you me,
she puts the "cheese" in "cheesecake."


682
00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:55.145
Well, Jane Eyre has been selling popcorn
for over a hundred years, L.B.


683
00:56:35.895 --> 00:56:40.524
Hello.

684
00:56:45.738 --> 00:56:48.615
Could you reach me a towel?

685
00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.791
I ...

686
00:56:58.918 --> 00:57:02.170
I really can't do that.

687
00:57:03.798 --> 00:57:05.340
I'm sorry.

688
00:57:30.158 --> 00:57:34.494
I'm an idiot. I'm a complete idiot,
and I'm sorry.


689
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:38.415
- Forget it.
- No, no. I'm a vain, preening ass ...


690
00:57:38.583 --> 00:57:43.587
... without a single redeeming feature.
- That's not true. You have very good teeth.


691
00:57:44.088 --> 00:57:45.547
Come on.

692
00:57:46.424 --> 00:57:50.761
I've got a better idea. Take me flying.
Or better yet, I'll take you flying.


693
00:57:50.928 --> 00:57:52.679
Do your worst, Miss Hepburn.

694
00:58:01.773 --> 00:58:05.609
Don't be so squirmy. You're gonna
get on famously with Father and Mother.


695
00:58:05.777 --> 00:58:09.404
And I'm sure they'll like you too.
Once they get to know you.


696
00:58:17.747 --> 00:58:20.540
- Hello! Hello!
- Kath, hello.


697
00:58:20.708 --> 00:58:22.250
Kathy.

698
00:58:25.213 --> 00:58:28.924
- Who's that with the camera right there?
- That's my ex-husband, Ludlow.


699
00:58:29.092 --> 00:58:31.385
Father and Mother are just mad
about Luddie.


700
00:58:31.552 --> 00:58:35.889
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Oh, he's here all the time.


701
00:58:36.766 --> 00:58:38.433
Hello!

702
00:58:39.936 --> 00:58:41.395
Sorry we're late.

703
00:58:41.562 --> 00:58:43.855
- Mom.
- Oh. Oh, thank you.


704
00:58:44.023 --> 00:58:45.649
- Dad.
- Darling.


705
00:58:45.817 --> 00:58:49.111
- Uncle Willy.
- Oh, who have we got here?


706
00:58:49.278 --> 00:58:52.030
- Don't feel self-conscious.
- Hepburns! Hepburns!


707
00:58:52.198 --> 00:58:55.951
Attention, please. 
This is Howard.

708
00:58:56.244 --> 00:58:58.078
Howard, welcome.

709
00:58:59.414 --> 00:59:01.498
Don't worry, he's had his lunch.

710
00:59:03.126 --> 00:59:05.001
He likes you. That's unusual.

711
00:59:05.169 --> 00:59:08.505
We pay our devotion to the arts here.
A colony we created.


712
00:59:08.673 --> 00:59:12.634
Julian's a painter. Abstract, of course.
What's the point of painting ...


713
00:59:12.802 --> 00:59:16.179
... something real when you can just
take a picture nowadays?


714
00:59:16.347 --> 00:59:18.807
Where do you stand on politics,
Mr. Hughes?


715
00:59:19.267 --> 00:59:21.810
- Excuse me?
- We're all socialists here.


716
00:59:21.978 --> 00:59:23.395
We are not.

717
00:59:24.647 --> 00:59:27.232
You've met Mr. Roosevelt.
What make you of him?


718
00:59:30.445 --> 00:59:32.487
What are you sniggering at?

719
00:59:32.655 --> 00:59:34.990
- What? What was that?
- You just sniggered.


720
00:59:35.783 --> 00:59:38.785
No, no. The dog.
It seems to be crushing my feet.


721
00:59:38.953 --> 00:59:40.912
- Oh, my God!
- Buster!


722
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.330
Hey. Hey!

723
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.459
Don't you like dogs?

724
00:59:45.626 --> 00:59:48.295
I will not have you sniggering
at Mr. Roosevelt.


725
00:59:48.463 --> 00:59:50.172
- Please leave.
- No. I wasn't.


726
00:59:50.339 --> 00:59:53.341
- I thought everybody liked dogs.
- Perhaps he had a bad experience.


727
00:59:53.509 --> 00:59:55.969
Does it upset you
that Howard gets more press?


728
00:59:56.137 --> 00:59:59.306
- A bad experience with a dog?
- No, no.


729
00:59:59.474 --> 01:00:04.019
- You are such a shy creature, aren't you?
- Perhaps it was a very large dog.


730
01:00:04.187 --> 01:00:07.981
- The press can be a damned nuisance.
- Was it a Doberman?


731
01:00:08.149 --> 01:00:11.234
- A Doberman, Mr. Hughes? Or a dachshund?
- Neither, sir.


732
01:00:11.402 --> 01:00:15.655
- Dachshunds are little dogs, Hep dear.
- They should all be lined up and shot.


733
01:00:15.823 --> 01:00:19.034
- What's that Spanish painting?
- The Goya.


734
01:00:19.202 --> 01:00:21.369
Goya. Of course. Yes.

735
01:00:22.038 --> 01:00:25.207
- Yes, Mexican.
- What was that called?


736
01:00:25.374 --> 01:00:29.503
Anyway, that's the vulgar press, I'm sure.
Do you read much, Mr. Hughes?


737
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:33.965
I try to stay up to snuff
on the trade journals, yeah.


738
01:00:34.133 --> 01:00:38.011
- Snuff?
- These would be flying magazines?


739
01:00:39.639 --> 01:00:42.057
- What was that?
- Oh, he's a little deaf.


740
01:00:42.225 --> 01:00:45.560
- Pass the goddamn butter, I beg you.
- You read flying magazines?


741
01:00:45.728 --> 01:00:48.814
Trade journals. On engineering. Aviation.

742
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:50.732
We read books.

743
01:00:51.108 --> 01:00:55.403
Howard has to read the trade pieces, Mom,
because he's designing a new aeroplane.


744
01:00:55.571 --> 01:00:57.572
Oh, really? Do tell.

745
01:01:00.785 --> 01:01:02.327
Well ...

746
01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.750
... it's quite exciting, actually.
It's a spy plane for the Air Corps.


747
01:01:08.918 --> 01:01:11.044
A twin-engine plane with some ...

748
01:01:11.212 --> 01:01:14.214
... I must admit,
some rather unique design features.


749
01:01:14.382 --> 01:01:16.925
You see,
it has these two booms at the back --


750
01:01:17.093 --> 01:01:20.178
Luddie built a birdhouse once.
You remember that, dear?


751
01:01:20.429 --> 01:01:23.640
- Yes, well, a mere trifle, darling.
- I remember the painting!


752
01:01:23.808 --> 01:01:26.476
The painting, it's called
May 18-0-something.


753
01:01:26.644 --> 01:01:29.521
Anyway, Goya's vastly overrated.
All the Spaniards are.


754
01:01:29.689 --> 01:01:32.399
- Nonsense! Picasso is sacred.
- I'm a urologist.


755
01:01:32.567 --> 01:01:35.443
- I' was quite aesthetic, really.
- A sacred monster.


756
01:01:35.611 --> 01:01:38.280
The birds don't care for it much,
but the bats do.


757
01:01:38.447 --> 01:01:40.615
- I'll bet.
- That's such bunk!


758
01:01:40.783 --> 01:01:44.077
- Do speak up, dear.
- Nothing, nothing, Mrs. Hepburn. Nothing.


759
01:01:44.245 --> 01:01:48.123
Why did you speak? I can't abide people
who speak but have nothing to say.


760
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:51.960
Did you go to mechanic school
to learn all this airplane guff?


761
01:01:52.128 --> 01:01:53.670
No, no, I didn't, Luddie. No.

762
01:01:53.838 --> 01:01:56.631
Well, Howard just flew round
the world in three days.


763
01:01:56.799 --> 01:01:59.718
- I think we've had enough about airplanes.
- And dogs.


764
01:01:59.886 --> 01:02:03.638
- Then how did you make all that money?
- We don't care about money here.


765
01:02:03.806 --> 01:02:05.765
Well, that's because you have it.

766
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.104
Would you repeat that?

767
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.358
You don't care about money
because you've always had it.


768
01:02:15.526 --> 01:02:18.486
- How did you make all that --?
- Excuse me, I'm speaking.


769
01:02:18.654 --> 01:02:19.905
- Okay.
- Thank you.


770
01:02:20.072 --> 01:02:21.531
All right.

771
01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:24.409
Some of us choose
to work for a living.

772
01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:29.831
Speaking of which, I have more of that
airplane guff to attend to.


773
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.334
Excuse me.

774
01:02:39.926 --> 01:02:42.594
Well, seems a rather high-strung chap.

775
01:02:43.012 --> 01:02:46.014
You're a fine bunch of bullies,
aren't you?


776
01:02:46.182 --> 01:02:49.517
Have you talked to Mr. Mayer
about letting you do Jane Eyre?


777
01:02:49.685 --> 01:02:52.979
The old philistine won't budge.
Too arty, don't you know.


778
01:02:53.147 --> 01:02:58.068
I'm convinced the man hasn't read anything
longer than a Katzenjammer Kids in his life.


779
01:02:59.445 --> 01:03:02.906
No fair, kicking.
You have to use the mallet.


780
01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:08.453
Really, darling, you can't retire
from the field of battle like that ...


781
01:03:08.621 --> 01:03:12.082
... or they'll never respect you.
- Katie, I don't understand.


782
01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:14.876
You're like a different person in there.

783
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:18.463
They just expect me
to be a certain way.

784
01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:24.678
There's only one real Kate,
and that's your Kate.


785
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:32.852
Over in Hollywood, aviation tycoon
Howard Hughes is cooking up something big.


786
01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:37.524
Even as he edits his new picture, he's been
secretly meeting with the U.S. Air Corps.


787
01:03:37.692 --> 01:03:41.236
We applaud his patriotism and look forward
to his newest marvel.


788
01:03:41.404 --> 01:03:44.823
You know how many Allied ships we lost
because of U-boat attacks?


789
01:03:44.991 --> 01:03:47.117
- No.
- Six hundred and eighty-one ships ...


790
01:03:47.284 --> 01:03:51.913
... just this year so far. The Army needs
a new airplane to fly the troops to Europe.


791
01:03:52.081 --> 01:03:55.583
These ships, they're sitting ducks
for the U-boats.


792
01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:59.421
- You wanna build a troop-carrier plane?
- Stop thinking like an insect.


793
01:03:59.588 --> 01:04:02.507
Not just to carry troops,
a plane to carry everything.


794
01:04:02.675 --> 01:04:06.928
The troops and the jeeps and the tanks
and whatnot. Here, take a look.


795
01:04:08.347 --> 01:04:10.181
No. Other side.

796
01:04:13.102 --> 01:04:16.646
I figure around 200 feet from nose to tail.
Wingspan, around 300.


797
01:04:16.814 --> 01:04:19.399
We're gonna need
about 24,000 horsepower.


798
01:04:20.693 --> 01:04:23.778
Now, this is just what Kaiser
and the Army are looking for.


799
01:04:23.946 --> 01:04:27.449
- They're gonna pay for it this time.
- What are you getting us into?


800
01:04:27.616 --> 01:04:30.493
Well, it's a big plane,
so I'm calling it The Hercules.


801
01:04:30.995 --> 01:04:32.537
Swell name, isn't it?

802
01:04:32.955 --> 01:04:36.124
- How heavy you imagine this thing is?
- Say around 200 tons.


803
01:04:39.295 --> 01:04:41.796
Well, I didn't say
it was gonna be easy.

804
01:04:42.298 --> 01:04:45.383
All right, boys,
I want you to rig up something like this.


805
01:04:45.551 --> 01:04:50.013
Should give the proper uplift ratios and
reduce need for torque support on the front.


806
01:04:50.181 --> 01:04:53.933
We are not getting enough production
out of Jane Russell's breasts.


807
01:04:54.101 --> 01:04:56.644
I want smooth titties, gentlemen.
Smooth titties.


808
01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.609
- It's all in engineering, isn't it, Odie?
- Howard ...


809
01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:07.739
... do you really think they're gonna let you
put out a whole movie just about tits?


810
01:05:07.948 --> 01:05:10.825
Sure. Who doesn't like tits?

811
01:05:21.212 --> 01:05:24.506
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Sorry I'm late.


812
01:05:24.673 --> 01:05:29.177
Please record that Mr. Hughes has arrived
and this session is now called to order.


813
01:05:29.345 --> 01:05:32.138
- I yield the floor to Mr. Breen.
- Mr. Hughes ...


814
01:05:32.306 --> 01:05:36.184
... members of the committee, I've reviewed
the photoplay entitled The Outlaw ...


815
01:05:36.352 --> 01:05:40.105
... and I can state that I have never seen
anything so unacceptable ...


816
01:05:40.272 --> 01:05:44.192
... as the shots of the mammaries
of the character named Rio.


817
01:05:44.568 --> 01:05:48.696
For almost half the picture,
the girl's mammaries, which are quite large ...


818
01:05:48.864 --> 01:05:52.033
... and prominent,
are shockingly uncovered.


819
01:05:52.993 --> 01:05:57.247
For this reason, I concluded the picture
appeals only to prurient interests ...


820
01:05:57.414 --> 01:06:01.960
... and should be denied the Motion Picture
Association's seal of approval.


821
01:06:02.586 --> 01:06:04.838
Really, Mr. Hughes.

822
01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:08.633
- Thank you, Mr. Breen. Mr. Hughes.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


823
01:06:08.968 --> 01:06:11.136
Mr. Breen. It's good to see you again.

824
01:06:11.303 --> 01:06:15.431
I haven't seen you all since that situation
with all the violence in Scarface.


825
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:18.768
The situation here revolves
around Miss Russell's mammaries.


826
01:06:18.936 --> 01:06:21.521
Mr. Breen feels that they are
too prominent, yes?


827
01:06:21.689 --> 01:06:25.066
More prominent than other mammaries
have been up on the screen?


828
01:06:25.234 --> 01:06:27.861
Well, I hope to dispel that notion.

829
01:06:31.365 --> 01:06:32.782
Jean Harlow.

830
01:06:34.743 --> 01:06:36.369
Ann Sheridan.

831
01:06:37.788 --> 01:06:39.247
Irene Dunne.

832
01:06:39.415 --> 01:06:41.040
Claudette Colbert.

833
01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:43.334
Rita Hayworth.

834
01:06:43.752 --> 01:06:48.089
Betty Grable.
And the lovely Miss Jane Russell.


835
01:06:48.257 --> 01:06:52.594
Now, all these shots, save for Miss Russell,
were enlarged from pictures ...


836
01:06:52.761 --> 01:06:56.055
... that received
Mr. Breen's seal of approval.


837
01:06:56.682 --> 01:07:01.769
Now, as you've probably noticed by now,
they all contain mammaries.


838
01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:05.773
I will ask my associate to join me now.
May I introduce ...


839
01:07:05.941 --> 01:07:09.652
... Dr. Ludlow Branson
of Columbia University.


840
01:07:11.113 --> 01:07:12.947
Dr. Branson ...

841
01:07:13.574 --> 01:07:17.035
... is a mathematician of some note.

842
01:07:17.203 --> 01:07:19.704
Yes. And he will now demonstrate ...

843
01:07:19.872 --> 01:07:21.623
... that in fact ...

844
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:25.293
... Miss Russell's mammaries
are no more prominent ...


845
01:07:25.461 --> 01:07:28.296
... than any of these other fine ladies'.

846
01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:32.091
Doctor.

847
01:07:33.594 --> 01:07:35.178
Doctor ...

848
01:07:36.055 --> 01:07:38.306
... you forgot your calipers.

849
01:07:45.105 --> 01:07:48.316
Gentlemen, Mr. Hughes.

850
01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:53.613
Let us commence by calling this ...

851
01:07:54.448 --> 01:07:56.741
... Mammary Exhibit Number One.

852
01:07:56.909 --> 01:08:02.664
Now, you'll see that the length
of the actual cleavage ...


853
01:08:03.415 --> 01:08:06.626
... if I may, is ...

854
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.837
... 5 inches and a quarter.

855
01:08:10.214 --> 01:08:11.589
Now if we move to Mammary Exhibit ...

856
01:08:11.757 --> 01:08:13.216
Dateline: Hollywoodland.

857
01:08:13.384 --> 01:08:16.886
Movie tycoon Howard Hughes
must have the greatest job in the land.


858
01:08:17.054 --> 01:08:20.515
Every night, the lucky guy escorts
a different beautiful woman ...


859
01:08:20.683 --> 01:08:22.600
... to a different dazzling event.

860
01:08:22.768 --> 01:08:27.438
The TWA king always talks up
his airline as he escorts a succession ...


861
01:08:29.733 --> 01:08:31.859
The Hercules, ladies and gentlemen.

862
01:08:32.027 --> 01:08:33.528
The Hercules.

863
01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:37.615
A plane, a boat, a flying city.

864
01:08:37.783 --> 01:08:41.244
Don't forget, every bill comes to me.
They don't pay for anything.


865
01:08:41.412 --> 01:08:44.872
Those men decide whether to fund
the plane, so I need them happy.


866
01:08:45.207 --> 01:08:47.500
- You do what it takes.
- You betcha, boss.


867
01:08:47.876 --> 01:08:50.211
How are the girls
in the bomb department?


868
01:08:50.379 --> 01:08:54.215
Well, let's put it this way,
it'll be a regular boob buffet.


869
01:08:54.383 --> 01:08:57.468
I don't think the Air Corps men
will have trouble scoring.


870
01:08:57.636 --> 01:09:01.306
- Good.
- And inside, 700 brave American soldiers ...


871
01:09:01.473 --> 01:09:05.977
... a dozen Sherman tanks all winging
their way over the Atlantic ...


872
01:09:06.145 --> 01:09:08.563
... free from the threats
of the U-boats below.


873
01:09:08.731 --> 01:09:13.067
Could Jules Verne himself have
ever imagined anything so magnificent?


874
01:09:13.235 --> 01:09:17.196
Could he have imagined her mammoth
wingspan, longer than a football field?


875
01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:19.198
Don't you see how this demeans me?

876
01:09:19.366 --> 01:09:21.701
Since when do you care
about scandal rags?


877
01:09:21.869 --> 01:09:25.163
Every time there's a picture of you with
another woman, it's a slap in the face.


878
01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:28.291
- Don't you understand that?
- Well, that's overstating it.


879
01:09:28.459 --> 01:09:31.794
Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers,
Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine ...


880
01:09:31.962 --> 01:09:34.881
... and now Bette Davis,
for God's sake.


881
01:09:36.759 --> 01:09:41.929
Look, they're Cracker Jack candy, honey.
They don't mean anything to me.


882
01:09:42.097 --> 01:09:45.058
Oh, very nice.

883
01:09:46.727 --> 01:09:49.604
You're the one that said
that all men are predators.


884
01:09:49.772 --> 01:09:52.690
I mean, it's all in Darwin, remember?

885
01:09:53.025 --> 01:09:56.611
And am I to expect this behavior
to continue after the wedding?


886
01:09:56.779 --> 01:09:58.863
What is really bothering you, Kate?

887
01:09:59.031 --> 01:10:02.283
Is it the women or the publicity?

888
01:10:07.539 --> 01:10:11.793
Can't you eat ice cream from a bowl
like everyone else in the world?


889
01:10:18.884 --> 01:10:22.470
Don't you dare.

890
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:35.400
Yeah.

891
01:10:36.568 --> 01:10:40.154
No, Odie, this is not a good time.

892
01:10:40.406 --> 01:10:44.575
For chrissakes, we can't make The Hercules
if we don't have any aluminum.


893
01:10:44.743 --> 01:10:46.327
Wait.

894
01:10:46.495 --> 01:10:49.580
I can hear you better now.
Tell the War Production Board ...


895
01:10:49.748 --> 01:10:52.959
... that this is an essential
strategic operation.


896
01:10:53.127 --> 01:10:57.672
If they're giving aluminum to Boeing,
they can give some to Hughes Aircraft.


897
01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.842
Don't set the ice cream --

898
01:11:01.009 --> 01:11:05.346
We gotta think of something else. If we
can't get aluminum, we'll find another way.


899
01:11:05.806 --> 01:11:09.142
You tell me. We'll find
some alloy that works just as well.


900
01:11:09.393 --> 01:11:12.019
Right. Look ...

901
01:11:12.187 --> 01:11:16.357
- If we can't get aluminum, we'll use wood.
- You can't make a plane out of wood.


902
01:11:16.525 --> 01:11:19.026
Why not?
The damn thing is a flying boat, right?


903
01:11:19.194 --> 01:11:21.195
- What do they use to make boats?
- Oak.


904
01:11:21.363 --> 01:11:24.282
And think of The Hercules
like a flying Spanish galleon.


905
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:27.243
Spanish galleons
can weigh 1,200 tons.


906
01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.954
Good luck today.

907
01:11:30.497 --> 01:11:33.833
We just have to find the right wood.
Something light but strong.


908
01:11:34.001 --> 01:11:36.794
- Morning, Kate.
- Pine, cedar, maybe birch.


909
01:11:47.306 --> 01:11:48.890
Catch.

910
01:11:52.811 --> 01:11:54.604
From my farm.

911
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:57.773
If you like it, 
I can get you a bushel.

912
01:12:10.579 --> 01:12:13.039
Trouble with Mr. Hughes?

913
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:22.882
There's too much Howard Hughes
in Howard Hughes.


914
01:12:24.718 --> 01:12:26.761
That's the trouble.

915
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.692
Beautiful.

916
01:12:43.654 --> 01:12:45.071
Don't you take Christmas off?

917
01:12:46.406 --> 01:12:49.158
Nice to see you.
Sorry, I've got grease on my hands.


918
01:12:49.326 --> 01:12:51.869
Have we got something to show you.

919
01:12:56.250 --> 01:13:00.962
Take a look. The XF-11
reconnaissance flier. Spy plane, really.


920
01:13:01.922 --> 01:13:04.632
Designed every inch of her myself.

921
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.801
She's got a top speed of 450 ...

922
01:13:06.969 --> 01:13:09.804
... which means she can outrun
anything they throw against her.


923
01:13:09.972 --> 01:13:13.057
After the Japs stole
my H-1 design for their Zeros ...


924
01:13:13.225 --> 01:13:15.393
... I needed to do them one better.

925
01:13:16.478 --> 01:13:19.647
Yeah, she's my Buck Rogers ship.

926
01:13:19.815 --> 01:13:21.816
She's a looker.

927
01:13:22.484 --> 01:13:24.110
Okay, what do you got for me?

928
01:13:31.535 --> 01:13:33.786
Jiminy Cricket.

929
01:13:33.954 --> 01:13:37.623
Seating capacity for 60.
Wingspan, 123 feet.


930
01:13:37.791 --> 01:13:41.168
Four Double Cyclone engines.
Her ceiling's 25,000 feet.


931
01:13:41.336 --> 01:13:44.547
- Gross weight?
- 86,000, wing loading of 41 pounds.


932
01:13:44.715 --> 01:13:47.508
So less drag on
the plane in thinner air.

933
01:13:47.676 --> 01:13:51.178
So high-cruise power, you're looking
at a top speed of around 340.


934
01:13:52.222 --> 01:13:55.808
Giving her a range of about 3000 miles.

935
01:13:56.977 --> 01:13:59.478
- Cross-country.
- Non-stop.


936
01:14:00.772 --> 01:14:02.356
Bob ...

937
01:14:02.524 --> 01:14:05.693
... you know something?
You are a son of a bitch.


938
01:14:16.622 --> 01:14:20.124
Yeah. Bob, you got
something on your suit.


939
01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:23.169
Yeah.

940
01:14:23.545 --> 01:14:26.047
On your lapel.
You got something on your lapel.


941
01:14:29.176 --> 01:14:31.052
Right there, Bob.

942
01:14:32.804 --> 01:14:34.388
You missed it. Right there.

943
01:14:36.683 --> 01:14:38.559
Clean it off, would you?

944
01:14:38.727 --> 01:14:41.228
Here. Thanks.

945
01:14:44.483 --> 01:14:45.900
No, throw it away.

946
01:14:49.946 --> 01:14:51.364
No, over there.

947
01:14:57.871 --> 01:15:01.707
Thanks. So, what do you call her?

948
01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:04.043
The Constellation,
but we can change that.


949
01:15:04.211 --> 01:15:05.836
No, no.

950
01:15:06.004 --> 01:15:09.048
It's pretty. I like her.

951
01:15:10.008 --> 01:15:12.093
So, what kind of
deal can you give me?

952
01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.095
What kind of deal can you give me?

953
01:15:14.262 --> 01:15:16.555
The first 40 planes off the assembly line.

954
01:15:16.723 --> 01:15:19.266
That should give us about
two years' exclusivity.


955
01:15:19.434 --> 01:15:20.726
Hell, more than that.

956
01:15:20.894 --> 01:15:24.897
United and American don't have
the imagination for a plane like this.


957
01:15:25.065 --> 01:15:27.650
Two years ahead of Juan Trippe, then.

958
01:15:32.698 --> 01:15:33.948
How much?

959
01:15:34.116 --> 01:15:36.283
Four hundred and fifty thousand each.

960
01:15:37.119 --> 01:15:39.954
So that's 18 million for the first 40.

961
01:15:40.914 --> 01:15:43.958
Hell, TWA can't afford that.
The damn airline's flat broke.


962
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:50.631
Guess I'll just have
to pay for them myself.


963
01:15:51.508 --> 01:15:54.593
Build them, Bob.
Send the bill to Noah Dietrich.


964
01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:56.303
Oh, and thank you.

965
01:16:00.058 --> 01:16:01.892
Merry Christmas.

966
01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:06.522
You've just placed the largest order for
airplanes in the history of the damn planet.


967
01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:08.816
Lockheed sent us a bill for $18 million.

968
01:16:08.984 --> 01:16:12.278
Don't get all hysterical on me, Noah.
It isn't good for you.


969
01:16:12.446 --> 01:16:15.781
- This is a lot of money for planes.
- I know it's a lot of money.


970
01:16:15.949 --> 01:16:19.577
It's too damn much. You think I've got
$18 million in petty cash?


971
01:16:19.745 --> 01:16:21.912
I should've told you. 
It slipped my mind.

972
01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.998
- Slipped your mind? Oh, for --
- Right.


973
01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:27.626
- I'll get back to you. Bye.
- How could $18 million slip your mind?


974
01:16:28.503 --> 01:16:31.672
Hey, honey.
What are you doing home?


975
01:16:36.094 --> 01:16:38.929
You're not one for tears, and, well ...

976
01:16:39.097 --> 01:16:43.350
... neither am l,
so it's best to come out with it.


977
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.691
I've met someone.
I've fallen in love and I'm moving out.


978
01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:58.073
If I could make it
any more gentle, I would.


979
01:16:58.241 --> 01:17:02.328
But I can't, so ...

980
01:17:03.371 --> 01:17:05.247
... there we both are.

981
01:17:08.877 --> 01:17:10.711
Let's be honest.

982
01:17:10.879 --> 01:17:15.382
It's all been a grand adventure,
but it couldn't possibly last.


983
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:18.427
We're too alike, you and I.

984
01:17:21.556 --> 01:17:22.890
You met someone?

985
01:17:23.058 --> 01:17:26.977
Someone more appropriate.
To me, I mean.


986
01:17:29.689 --> 01:17:32.650
What does that mean,
"more appropriate"?


987
01:17:33.068 --> 01:17:37.154
Someone more attuned to my needs.

988
01:17:37.697 --> 01:17:39.615
Look at me, Katie.

989
01:17:39.783 --> 01:17:41.700
Stop acting.

990
01:17:42.118 --> 01:17:44.912
I'm not acting.

991
01:17:49.543 --> 01:17:52.169
I wonder if you even know anymore.

992
01:17:57.092 --> 01:17:59.301
Don't be unkind.

993
01:18:02.013 --> 01:18:03.722
You ...?

994
01:18:05.058 --> 01:18:06.392
You wanna go?

995
01:18:10.021 --> 01:18:11.647
Go on.

996
01:18:12.232 --> 01:18:15.359
Actresses are cheap in this town, darling.

997
01:18:15.527 --> 01:18:18.112
- And I got a lot of money.
- This is beneath you.


998
01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.739
No, no, this is exactly me.

999
01:18:20.907 --> 01:18:26.036
You tell me you're leaving me, and you
have the nerve to expect graciousness?


1000
01:18:26.496 --> 01:18:28.497
I expect a little maturity.

1001
01:18:28.665 --> 01:18:31.584
I expect you to face the situation
like an adult who --


1002
01:18:31.751 --> 01:18:34.044
Don't talk down to me!

1003
01:18:34.212 --> 01:18:37.214
Don't you ever talk down to me!
You are a movie star.


1004
01:18:37.382 --> 01:18:38.966
Nothing more.

1005
01:19:50.997 --> 01:19:52.915
Don't answer it.

1006
01:19:55.794 --> 01:19:57.503
What is it, Howard?

1007
01:19:57.671 --> 01:19:59.964
Hey, Noah ...

1008
01:20:00.131 --> 01:20:03.133
... I need you to get to Penney's
and buy me some clothes.


1009
01:20:03.301 --> 01:20:05.094
- Penney's isn't open.
- Oh, shit.


1010
01:20:05.261 --> 01:20:08.222
- It's 2 in the morning.
- Yeah, that's right.


1011
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:11.100
Well, first thing tomorrow, then, all right?

1012
01:20:11.267 --> 01:20:14.353
I need two new suits off the rack.
One light and one dark.


1013
01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:17.731
Three white shirts and three pairs
of white tennis shoes. Got that?


1014
01:20:17.899 --> 01:20:19.858
- Yeah.
- No, no.


1015
01:20:20.026 --> 01:20:21.860
- Make it Woolworth's.
- Woolworth's.


1016
01:20:22.028 --> 01:20:24.613
No, no, Penney's. Penney's.

1017
01:20:24.781 --> 01:20:26.532
All right.

1018
01:20:27.242 --> 01:20:30.035
I'll get into it as
soon as I can, Howard.

1019
01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:32.913
- All right?
- Noah, do you have a recorder?


1020
01:20:33.623 --> 01:20:36.834
- No.
- Are you recording this conversation?


1021
01:20:37.002 --> 01:20:39.420
- No.
- Okay.


1022
01:20:39.587 --> 01:20:41.422
I trust you.

1023
01:20:42.424 --> 01:20:45.801
- Howard --
- I need those suits first thing tomorrow.


1024
01:20:45.969 --> 01:20:49.430
- All right.
- Wait. Did I say Penney's or Woolworth's?


1025
01:20:49.597 --> 01:20:52.266
- Penney's.
- Better make it Sears.


1026
01:20:52.434 --> 01:20:54.935
All right, then, Sears.

1027
01:20:57.772 --> 01:20:59.940
I'm sorry, honey.

1028
01:21:01.151 --> 01:21:03.444
If I don't answer, he'll just call back.

1029
01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:28.343
Stop there, if you please, 
Miss Domergue.

1030
01:21:34.225 --> 01:21:36.143
Have you had surgery, 
Miss Domergue?

1031
01:21:37.979 --> 01:21:39.480
No.

1032
01:21:40.315 --> 01:21:43.400
Do you have scars of any kind?

1033
01:21:44.819 --> 01:21:46.320
No.

1034
01:21:47.989 --> 01:21:50.115
Wipe off your lipstick.

1035
01:21:54.662 --> 01:21:55.954
That's much better.

1036
01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:02.461
Now, you understand that you'd be
under contract to me? Personally.


1037
01:22:03.379 --> 01:22:05.005
Do you know what that means?

1038
01:22:13.848 --> 01:22:15.641
Now turn around for me.

1039
01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.400
Very nice.

1040
01:22:26.528 --> 01:22:28.403
You move well.

1041
01:22:31.241 --> 01:22:33.200
You live with your family, do you?

1042
01:22:35.328 --> 01:22:36.912
Yes.

1043
01:22:37.372 --> 01:22:38.914
That's nice.

1044
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:42.042
Tell me something.

1045
01:22:43.378 --> 01:22:45.796
How old are you, 
Miss Domergue?

1046
01:22:48.758 --> 01:22:50.551
Fifteen.

1047
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:55.097
Holy Mother of God.

1048
01:23:14.534 --> 01:23:18.328
Well, a car picks me up
every morning at 8, and off I go.


1049
01:23:18.496 --> 01:23:21.540
I'm getting my high school diploma.

1050
01:23:21.708 --> 01:23:24.418
Howard thinks that education is important.

1051
01:23:24.586 --> 01:23:26.962
- That's right.
- And then, after classes ...


1052
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:30.716
... I'm off for elocution
and grooming and fittings.


1053
01:23:30.884 --> 01:23:32.676
Well, blow me down.

1054
01:23:33.887 --> 01:23:36.096
Pan Am's working
out of the Cocoanut Grove?


1055
01:23:36.264 --> 01:23:38.223
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Juan.


1056
01:23:38.391 --> 01:23:40.100
Helen, good to see you.

1057
01:23:40.268 --> 01:23:42.769
- How are you, Howard?
- Good, thanks.


1058
01:23:42.937 --> 01:23:44.771
- This is Faith Domergue.
- Sit down.


1059
01:23:44.939 --> 01:23:46.773
- Pleasure.
- What are you doing here?


1060
01:23:46.941 --> 01:23:49.776
Well, I'm out to meet
with Douglas about the DC-4.


1061
01:23:49.944 --> 01:23:53.780
It's our new plane, and it is
gonna be a pip, let me tell you.


1062
01:23:53.948 --> 01:23:57.159
- How's the Constellation coming?
- Good.


1063
01:23:57.452 --> 01:23:58.744
Great.

1064
01:24:00.121 --> 01:24:02.623
So how about letting me steal a peek?

1065
01:24:04.626 --> 01:24:06.585
I don't think so.

1066
01:24:06.753 --> 01:24:09.796
I should be cross with you.
You stole Ray Loewy from us.


1067
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:14.134
- He's doing our interior design. That's right.
- He was doing ours.


1068
01:24:16.638 --> 01:24:18.388
So ...

1069
01:24:18.932 --> 01:24:21.391
... what are your colors?
- Stop fishing.


1070
01:24:23.144 --> 01:24:25.646
So you have buttons ...

1071
01:24:25.813 --> 01:24:27.231
... or zippers?

1072
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:28.941
I'm sorry?

1073
01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:34.780
Buttons or zippers for the drapes
on the sleeping berths?


1074
01:24:38.284 --> 01:24:39.952
Zippers.

1075
01:24:48.836 --> 01:24:50.420
Buttons.

1076
01:25:00.098 --> 01:25:03.100
So I suppose you'll be
expanding on down to Mexico.


1077
01:25:03.601 --> 01:25:07.145
- Why do you say that?
- Well, your range is 3000 miles.


1078
01:25:07.313 --> 01:25:11.400
I'd imagine you'd expand from Los Angeles
to Mexico and South America.


1079
01:25:11.567 --> 01:25:13.735
Hey, that's a good idea.
Anyone got a pen?


1080
01:25:13.903 --> 01:25:16.029
Or across the Atlantic.

1081
01:25:19.033 --> 01:25:20.951
You've had enough of this ice cream.

1082
01:25:21.119 --> 01:25:24.705
You give me that spoon. You don't
wanna get your gloves all sticky.


1083
01:25:26.666 --> 01:25:28.542
Isn't that too far?

1084
01:25:33.548 --> 01:25:35.465
New York ...

1085
01:25:35.633 --> 01:25:37.676
... to Newfoundland ...

1086
01:25:38.386 --> 01:25:39.636
... to Ireland.

1087
01:25:44.892 --> 01:25:46.476
To Paris.

1088
01:25:53.609 --> 01:25:55.235
Well ...

1089
01:25:55.778 --> 01:25:57.904
... Pan Am welcomes you.

1090
01:25:58.072 --> 01:25:59.906
We're overbooked as it is.

1091
01:26:00.074 --> 01:26:03.702
It's such a burden doing it all
on your own, let me tell you.


1092
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:05.912
So when's the Connie gonna be ready?

1093
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.749
- Next year maybe. DC-4?
- Next year.


1094
01:26:08.916 --> 01:26:12.085
Well, we look forward to her then.

1095
01:26:12.628 --> 01:26:14.379
And I to the Connie.

1096
01:26:16.257 --> 01:26:19.885
I've ordered the next 40 after you.

1097
01:26:20.094 --> 01:26:21.887
- It's Miss ...?
- Domergue.


1098
01:26:22.055 --> 01:26:25.432
Yes, of course. Now, was that a
rumba or a samba you were doing?


1099
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:28.602
- I' was a samba.
- A samba, yes.


1100
01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:32.022
Howard, I never knew
you were such a good dancer.


1101
01:26:32.982 --> 01:26:34.816
Helen, Jack.

1102
01:26:36.652 --> 01:26:39.446
Good going. You gave away
our entire postwar strategy.


1103
01:26:39.614 --> 01:26:44.117
- He can't stop us.
- He's Pan Am. He can stop anything.


1104
01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.954
Give me the largest
Scotch you got.


1105
01:26:48.122 --> 01:26:51.708
I don't know what in the hell you're
so damn giddy about. Excuse me.


1106
01:28:43.779 --> 01:28:45.238
Jack.

1107
01:28:45.406 --> 01:28:49.034
Get in touch with Joyce and Berg.
Those are my boys in Washington.


1108
01:28:49.202 --> 01:28:52.579
Set up a meeting with Jones,
secretary of commerce, old golfing buddy.


1109
01:28:52.747 --> 01:28:55.707
- Slow down.
- We'll need terminals in Ireland and France.


1110
01:28:55.875 --> 01:28:57.334
I wanna get some tax breaks.

1111
01:28:57.502 --> 01:29:01.171
If that ass thinks he owns the world,
he's got another thing coming.


1112
01:29:01.339 --> 01:29:04.216
Pan Am owns Europe.
We ought to think about Mexico.


1113
01:29:04.383 --> 01:29:08.470
To hell with Mexico. No airline should
have a monopoly on flying the Atlantic.


1114
01:29:08.638 --> 01:29:11.932
It just isn't fair.
He owns Pan Am, he owns Congress.


1115
01:29:12.099 --> 01:29:15.936
He owns the Civil Aeronautics Board,
but he does not own the sky.


1116
01:29:16.103 --> 01:29:18.772
We're in a street fight
with that son of a bitch.


1117
01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:22.609
I've been fighting high-hat
Ivy League pricks like him my whole life.


1118
01:29:22.777 --> 01:29:26.404
And listen, fire Ray Loewy.
You goddamn heard me? Fire Ray Loewy.


1119
01:29:26.572 --> 01:29:29.950
He's spying for Trippe.
That shitheel knew all about the buttons.


1120
01:29:30.117 --> 01:29:32.118
Spies in my midst, Jack.

1121
01:29:32.787 --> 01:29:34.621
Spies in my midst.

1122
01:29:49.053 --> 01:29:51.972
- Hello, Howard.
- Roland.


1123
01:29:53.849 --> 01:29:55.433
So ...

1124
01:29:55.601 --> 01:29:57.143
... what can I do for you?

1125
01:30:00.314 --> 01:30:04.317
I want all the pictures you have
of Kate Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.


1126
01:30:04.485 --> 01:30:08.029
All the negatives.
And I want you to kill the story.


1127
01:30:08.197 --> 01:30:11.575
Howard, he's a married man.
He's a Catholic.


1128
01:30:11.742 --> 01:30:13.994
They're movie stars.
Fair game all around.


1129
01:30:22.503 --> 01:30:24.671
My office knows where I am, Howard.

1130
01:30:25.673 --> 01:30:28.508
I'm not gonna kill you, Roland.

1131
01:30:28.676 --> 01:30:30.594
I don't do that.

1132
01:30:35.349 --> 01:30:37.976
- How much?
- Not for sale.


1133
01:30:41.230 --> 01:30:42.814
How much?

1134
01:30:43.691 --> 01:30:46.860
Not for sale.

1135
01:30:50.197 --> 01:30:52.282
You ever cheat on your wife, Roland?

1136
01:30:54.076 --> 01:30:56.536
You ever screw a colored girl?

1137
01:30:57.204 --> 01:31:00.373
You ever steal anything?
You ever hurt anyone?


1138
01:31:02.543 --> 01:31:04.377
Good night, Howard.

1139
01:31:04.754 --> 01:31:07.714
You ever go to
a Communist Party meeting, Roland?


1140
01:31:17.558 --> 01:31:19.726
TWA stock.

1141
01:31:20.728 --> 01:31:22.020
How much?

1142
01:31:23.606 --> 01:31:25.065
Fifty thousand shares.

1143
01:31:25.733 --> 01:31:27.192
Ten.

1144
01:31:30.237 --> 01:31:31.571
All right.

1145
01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.534
This isn't gonna be that easy.

1146
01:31:36.911 --> 01:31:40.288
He's been making big contributions
on both sides of the aisle.


1147
01:31:40.456 --> 01:31:43.917
And Jack Frye is out there
lobbying everybody in town.


1148
01:31:44.085 --> 01:31:47.253
The French and British ambassadors
are lined up on his side.


1149
01:31:48.589 --> 01:31:51.758
I'm telling you, TWA is serious
about going international.


1150
01:31:51.926 --> 01:31:53.551
Okay.

1151
01:31:53.719 --> 01:31:55.637
Point, Mr. Hughes.

1152
01:31:56.013 --> 01:31:59.683
I think it's time for you to introduce
the community airline bill ...


1153
01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:01.393
... on the floor of the Senate.

1154
01:32:02.395 --> 01:32:05.188
- Is it done?
- My people are finishing it right now.


1155
01:32:05.356 --> 01:32:09.901
I also have to get you on the committee
investigating the national defense.


1156
01:32:12.321 --> 01:32:15.407
On the committee or chairman?

1157
01:32:15.741 --> 01:32:18.410
I could be much more effective
as chairman.


1158
01:32:18.577 --> 01:32:22.330
It's a great public platform.
You know, it generates a lot of press.


1159
01:32:22.498 --> 01:32:25.959
- Wasn't Truman chairman of that committee?
- Yeah, right.


1160
01:32:26.127 --> 01:32:28.545
He's vice president.
Look what he did with it.


1161
01:32:28.713 --> 01:32:30.797
No, I think ...

1162
01:32:31.465 --> 01:32:33.425
I think chairman.

1163
01:32:34.093 --> 01:32:35.510
What do you think?

1164
01:32:37.555 --> 01:32:40.140
- Chairman. That is interesting.
- Yeah.


1165
01:32:40.307 --> 01:32:43.810
Let me show you
these specs for the DC-4.


1166
01:32:44.061 --> 01:32:47.522
Ava, what do you think about
Trans World Airlines?


1167
01:32:47.690 --> 01:32:50.233
Transcontinental and Western
doesn't fit anymore.


1168
01:32:50.401 --> 01:32:53.278
We're international,
we need a name that reflects that.


1169
01:32:53.446 --> 01:32:56.156
Trans World is good. 
Kind of peppy.

1170
01:32:56.323 --> 01:32:58.825
TWA, right?

1171
01:32:58.993 --> 01:33:01.786
That way you don't need
to repaint any of the planes.


1172
01:33:01.954 --> 01:33:04.122
That's you. Always pinching pennies.

1173
01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:07.292
Hand me my wrap.

1174
01:33:21.307 --> 01:33:23.475
Knock it off.

1175
01:33:29.690 --> 01:33:32.192
I have something for you.

1176
01:33:33.444 --> 01:33:35.278
Stay here.

1177
01:33:40.743 --> 01:33:43.411
- What the hell is this?
- It's a present.


1178
01:33:43.579 --> 01:33:45.497
Go on, open it.

1179
01:33:46.665 --> 01:33:50.126
Oh, a box of trash.
You shouldn't have.


1180
01:33:50.294 --> 01:33:52.003
Keep looking, keep looking.

1181
01:33:56.842 --> 01:33:58.885
It's a Kashmiri sapphire.

1182
01:33:59.053 --> 01:34:02.222
I had my boys all over
the damn globe looking for this.


1183
01:34:02.389 --> 01:34:03.640
Why?

1184
01:34:03.808 --> 01:34:05.058
Because.

1185
01:34:05.226 --> 01:34:06.893
Look.

1186
01:34:07.061 --> 01:34:09.103
It matches your eyes.

1187
01:34:09.271 --> 01:34:11.648
I am not for sale.

1188
01:34:11.816 --> 01:34:13.900
For chrissakes, it's just a present.

1189
01:34:14.068 --> 01:34:17.237
You can't buy me, Howard,
so stop trying.


1190
01:34:17.404 --> 01:34:20.990
Don't buy me any more diamonds
or sapphires or any other damn thing.


1191
01:34:21.158 --> 01:34:23.576
You can buy me dinner.
How about that?


1192
01:34:24.328 --> 01:34:25.578
Jesus, Ava.

1193
01:34:26.622 --> 01:34:29.707
It's bad enough I have to endure
those gym shoes of yours.


1194
01:34:29.875 --> 01:34:33.545
But I get all dolled up and we go out
in this jalopy without a hood.


1195
01:34:34.964 --> 01:34:38.091
Ava, will you marry me?

1196
01:34:38.259 --> 01:34:40.969
- No, Howard.
- Well, why not, for heaven's sake?


1197
01:34:41.136 --> 01:34:43.721
In the first place, 
I don't love you.

1198
01:34:43.889 --> 01:34:46.266
In the second place, 
I'm still married.

1199
01:34:46.433 --> 01:34:51.104
Look, you got girls stashed all over town.
You got a damn harem just at the Bel-Air.


1200
01:34:51.272 --> 01:34:53.231
Marry one of your bungalow girls.

1201
01:34:53.399 --> 01:34:57.193
Those are employees. I won't marry
an employee. How would that look?


1202
01:35:05.369 --> 01:35:06.619
What is going on?

1203
01:35:09.957 --> 01:35:12.584
- Oh, my God!
- Goddamn it!


1204
01:35:14.211 --> 01:35:15.461
Faith!

1205
01:35:16.255 --> 01:35:18.172
- Faith, what the hell?
- Look out!


1206
01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.050
Goddamn, what the hell are you doing?

1207
01:35:24.221 --> 01:35:26.973
- Are you okay, lady?
- What are you doing with her?


1208
01:35:27.141 --> 01:35:29.809
We are going to dinner.
Now, get out of there.


1209
01:35:29.977 --> 01:35:31.978
Get that crazy bitch away from me!

1210
01:35:32.146 --> 01:35:33.771
Don't you love me anymore?

1211
01:35:33.939 --> 01:35:35.481
Course I love you, pork chop.

1212
01:35:35.649 --> 01:35:37.442
Ava, look over here. Howard.

1213
01:35:38.152 --> 01:35:39.444
Hey.

1214
01:35:42.865 --> 01:35:45.491
Juan Trippe is working
with Senator Brewster now.


1215
01:35:45.659 --> 01:35:49.996
They're after you. If the community
airline bill becomes law, we are finished.


1216
01:35:50.164 --> 01:35:52.290
Pan Am will have a monopoly
on international travel.


1217
01:35:52.458 --> 01:35:55.001
Well, how can they justify it?
It's un-American.


1218
01:35:55.169 --> 01:35:59.005
Brewster is saying that nationalized
foreign carriers, like Air France ...


1219
01:35:59.173 --> 01:36:02.175
... can offer lower rates because
they don't have to compete.


1220
01:36:02.343 --> 01:36:05.678
Let's get rid of competition
and have a nationalized airline ...


1221
01:36:05.846 --> 01:36:08.890
... and why don't we make it Pan Am?
- I'm not kowtowing to anyone.


1222
01:36:09.058 --> 01:36:11.351
- Howard, I need you up here.
- One sec, Odie.


1223
01:36:11.518 --> 01:36:14.020
Look, we are Trans World Airlines,
all right?


1224
01:36:14.188 --> 01:36:18.566
Get me something with a circle or a globe
or something round, for God's sake.


1225
01:36:18.734 --> 01:36:20.026
- Speak up.
- One cut.


1226
01:36:20.194 --> 01:36:24.364
I don't give a rat's ass. I'm not making
a cut. I'll release it without a seal.


1227
01:36:24.531 --> 01:36:26.199
We gotta go public with this.

1228
01:36:26.367 --> 01:36:28.242
I'm gonna talk to Hearst ...

1229
01:36:28.410 --> 01:36:31.579
... but we gotta get
some senators on our side.


1230
01:36:31.747 --> 01:36:34.165
- What do you want me to do?
- What Trippe does.


1231
01:36:34.333 --> 01:36:37.043
Offshore operations.
See who's up for re-election ...


1232
01:36:37.211 --> 01:36:39.837
... let's start making donations.
- Bribe senators?


1233
01:36:40.255 --> 01:36:42.924
I don't want them bribed.
I want it done legally.


1234
01:36:43.092 --> 01:36:46.427
I want them bought.
Put a team of investigators on Brewster.


1235
01:36:46.595 --> 01:36:48.930
I need to know everything
about that shitbag.


1236
01:36:49.098 --> 01:36:52.016
Where he goes, what he says
and who he screws.


1237
01:36:52.184 --> 01:36:54.185
- Get into it right now.
- You got it.


1238
01:37:01.819 --> 01:37:03.236
Just give me a second.

1239
01:37:05.572 --> 01:37:08.574
- All right, what do you need?
- Rudder and elevators.


1240
01:37:09.243 --> 01:37:11.327
No. These are fine.

1241
01:37:11.495 --> 01:37:15.581
Have Simon and Pete get back to me on the
assemblies. We need a secondary system.


1242
01:37:15.749 --> 01:37:17.250
Okay.

1243
01:37:18.085 --> 01:37:20.753
Listen, we need to take
another look at the wheel.


1244
01:37:20.921 --> 01:37:23.756
- Jesus. The damn wheel?
- Yeah.


1245
01:37:23.924 --> 01:37:25.425
It just doesn't feel right.

1246
01:37:25.592 --> 01:37:29.595
Christ almighty, you've seen 8000
goddamn wheels. Choose one, please.


1247
01:37:29.763 --> 01:37:31.597
- Just one of them.
- I know, I know.


1248
01:37:31.765 --> 01:37:34.100
- This one?
- I know, this one ...


1249
01:37:34.268 --> 01:37:38.104
This one's pretty close. Pretty close.

1250
01:38:14.141 --> 01:38:15.641
Odie.

1251
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.103
That man sweeping up over there ...

1252
01:38:19.271 --> 01:38:22.315
... does he work for me?
I mean, have you seen him before?


1253
01:38:22.483 --> 01:38:25.068
Name's Nick, something like that.

1254
01:38:27.321 --> 01:38:29.072
Why's he looking at me?

1255
01:38:31.283 --> 01:38:32.700
I don't know.

1256
01:38:34.828 --> 01:38:37.955
Fire him. And make sure
they use damp brooms from now on.


1257
01:38:38.123 --> 01:38:41.501
Respiratory diseases are expensive,
and I don't want lawsuits.


1258
01:38:41.668 --> 01:38:44.545
But can we at least proceed
with the instrument panel?


1259
01:38:44.713 --> 01:38:47.173
- The tool shop's ready.
- I wanna see the blueprints.


1260
01:38:47.341 --> 01:38:50.301
Look, Howard, the deadline
is now completely unrealistic.


1261
01:38:50.469 --> 01:38:53.012
The war is gonna be over
by the time she's done.


1262
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:57.350
I need you to help consult on vital decisions,
and you're off dealing with movies.


1263
01:38:57.518 --> 01:39:00.520
You got 1,000 workers waiting
for you to make a decision --


1264
01:39:00.687 --> 01:39:02.313
Hey, Odie!

1265
01:39:02.481 --> 01:39:04.482
Take it easy, all right.

1266
01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:08.694
You're under pressure, but it's gonna
do me no good if you crack up on me.


1267
01:39:09.363 --> 01:39:11.114
All right? Look ...

1268
01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:13.616
... take a couple
of hours off, all right.

1269
01:39:13.784 --> 01:39:15.660
- You just relax a little.
- Okay.


1270
01:39:16.078 --> 01:39:18.121
- See your wife.
- Okay.


1271
01:39:18.539 --> 01:39:19.872
All right.

1272
01:39:20.749 --> 01:39:24.001
- Be sure to show me all the blueprints.
- All right.


1273
01:39:25.629 --> 01:39:30.341
Show me all the blueprints.

1274
01:39:30.509 --> 01:39:34.137
I'm serious, now.
Show me all the blueprints.


1275
01:39:35.722 --> 01:39:37.390
Show me all the blueprints.

1276
01:39:37.558 --> 01:39:40.434
- Howard.
- Show me all the blueprints.


1277
01:39:40.602 --> 01:39:46.524
Show me all the blueprints.

1278
01:39:46.692 --> 01:39:48.776
I wanna get this done right.

1279
01:39:49.570 --> 01:39:57.410
Show me all the blueprints.

1280
01:39:57.578 --> 01:39:59.495
- Howard.
- Show me all the blueprints.


1281
01:39:59.663 --> 01:40:03.332
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints ...


1282
01:40:30.319 --> 01:40:32.778
Quarantine.

1283
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.489
Q ...

1284
01:40:35.657 --> 01:40:37.617
... U ...

1285
01:40:37.784 --> 01:40:40.036
... A ...

1286
01:40:40.662 --> 01:40:42.622
... R ...

1287
01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:45.249
... A ...

1288
01:40:45.417 --> 01:40:46.918
... N ...

1289
01:40:47.085 --> 01:40:49.295
... T ...

1290
01:40:49.671 --> 01:40:51.255
... I ...

1291
01:40:51.423 --> 01:40:52.924
... N ...

1292
01:40:57.846 --> 01:40:59.889
... E.

1293
01:41:02.809 --> 01:41:04.894
Quarantine.

1294
01:41:42.891 --> 01:41:45.977
General McEwan. Colonel Bertrang.
Thanks for coming down.


1295
01:41:46.144 --> 01:41:48.312
Odie, you reading me okay?

1296
01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.689
Yeah, you're A
-Okay.

1297
01:41:55.362 --> 01:41:58.531
All right, flight controls are active.
She's all yours.


1298
01:42:07.457 --> 01:42:09.792
Spotless.
No wiggle on the wheel or throttle.


1299
01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.794
Take it easy.

1300
01:42:28.812 --> 01:42:32.398
- How does she sound, Howard?
- She's whispering to me, buddy.


1301
01:42:32.566 --> 01:42:34.483
All right, make her sing.

1302
01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:58.591
Well, Odie, she can fly. 
Congratulations.

1303
01:42:58.759 --> 01:43:02.261
I'm glad to hear it. Retract landing gear
and climb to 5000 feet ...


1304
01:43:02.429 --> 01:43:04.013
... on a heading of 2-7-0.

1305
01:43:04.181 --> 01:43:10.061
Retracting landing gear and climbing
to 5,000 feet on a heading 2-7-0.


1306
01:43:14.566 --> 01:43:16.776
- She's fast.
- What's your air speed?


1307
01:43:16.943 --> 01:43:18.569
292.

1308
01:43:18.779 --> 01:43:22.281
- All right, take her back to 200.
- No damn way.


1309
01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:49.809
We gotta bring her home.

1310
01:43:49.976 --> 01:43:52.436
Scheduled time of one hour
and 45 minutes has elapsed.


1311
01:43:52.646 --> 01:43:55.564
- Set course for 0-9-0 --
- Ten more minutes. Roger that.


1312
01:43:55.732 --> 01:43:58.317
Negative, Howard. 
Bring her home.

1313
01:43:58.485 --> 01:44:04.365
Okay. Okay. Setting course for 0-9-0.

1314
01:44:05.075 --> 01:44:06.992
Preparing to descend.

1315
01:44:10.622 --> 01:44:13.874
- Jesus.
- What is it, Howard?


1316
01:44:15.168 --> 01:44:18.671
The right wing just dipped.
I'm losing starboard engine.


1317
01:44:19.131 --> 01:44:21.757
Increasing power to 2800 rpm.

1318
01:44:22.217 --> 01:44:23.467
Cutting back.

1319
01:44:23.844 --> 01:44:25.761
Increasing starboard engine only.

1320
01:44:26.888 --> 01:44:29.640
Cutting back. I'm losing altitude.

1321
01:44:29.808 --> 01:44:32.351
Check starboard-engine manifold pressure.

1322
01:44:33.228 --> 01:44:37.106
- It's good, but rpm's are low.
- Are both starboard props turning?


1323
01:44:37.274 --> 01:44:38.732
Hold on.

1324
01:44:38.984 --> 01:44:42.027
They are, but she's pulling me
back and starboard, Odie.


1325
01:44:42.195 --> 01:44:44.780
- How bad is your cross control?
- I'm at full left rudder ...


1326
01:44:44.948 --> 01:44:48.242
... and full left aileron,
but she won't stay level. Goddamn it.


1327
01:44:48.535 --> 01:44:51.370
- Give us your position.
- Two thousand feet over --


1328
01:44:51.538 --> 01:44:55.624
Oh, Christ, I don't know, Beverly Hills.
Fifteen hundred feet.


1329
01:44:55.792 --> 01:44:57.501
We're going down.

1330
01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:02.047
I'll try for the Wilshire Country Club.
Ninth hole. You reading me?


1331
01:45:02.215 --> 01:45:06.135
Wilshire Country Club, copy that.
Howard, reduce engines to 1,000.


1332
01:45:06.845 --> 01:45:11.807
I'm going down!
I'm not gonna make it, buddy!


1333
01:45:18.273 --> 01:45:20.065
Goddamn it!

1334
01:47:22.439 --> 01:47:25.941
Is there anyone else inside?
Is there anyone else?!


1335
01:47:26.109 --> 01:47:27.818
No.

1336
01:47:31.656 --> 01:47:35.034
I'm Howard Hughes, the aviator.

1337
01:47:44.294 --> 01:47:47.004
-- every inch of his
wiring and fluid connection.


1338
01:47:47.172 --> 01:47:49.840
He has burns to
78 percent of his body.

1339
01:47:50.008 --> 01:47:52.676
Nine ribs are shattered,
not broken, shattered ...


1340
01:47:53.178 --> 01:47:57.640
... as are his nose, his chin, his cheek,
his left knee, his left elbow.


1341
01:47:57.807 --> 01:48:00.392
He has 60 lacerations
on his face, to the bone.


1342
01:48:00.977 --> 01:48:03.729
His chest was crushed,
so his left lung collapsed ...


1343
01:48:03.897 --> 01:48:07.566
... and his heart has shifted
to the right side of his chest cavity.


1344
01:48:08.526 --> 01:48:10.402
Jesus, God.

1345
01:48:10.862 --> 01:48:15.199
- He's getting blood transfusions now, but --
- Whose blood?


1346
01:48:16.034 --> 01:48:18.202
- I'm sorry?
- Whose blood?


1347
01:48:18.703 --> 01:48:20.245
From our stock.

1348
01:48:20.914 --> 01:48:25.084
- Oh, he's not going to like that.
- Mr. Dietrich, I doubt he's ...


1349
01:48:25.251 --> 01:48:28.212
... ever gonna like or
dislike anything again.


1350
01:48:28.838 --> 01:48:31.006
I'm terribly sorry.

1351
01:48:59.452 --> 01:49:01.370
Orange juice.

1352
01:49:04.457 --> 01:49:07.918
It's not fresh from
the kitchen, so I ...

1353
01:49:08.628 --> 01:49:13.716
I have them make it here so ...
So I can see.


1354
01:49:17.804 --> 01:49:19.763
Look at me.

1355
01:49:22.392 --> 01:49:24.393
I'm a monster.

1356
01:49:24.853 --> 01:49:29.648
Yeah. Orange juice has nutritional value.

1357
01:49:30.817 --> 01:49:35.821
There's ... There's some flies
outside my window, though.


1358
01:49:36.364 --> 01:49:38.157
So ...

1359
01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.828
... little Howard likes ...

1360
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:46.457
... citrus.

1361
01:49:47.208 --> 01:49:49.084
Don't he just ...?

1362
01:49:52.213 --> 01:49:53.922
Tell me.

1363
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:59.344
An oil seal ripped off
the starboard rear propeller.


1364
01:49:59.512 --> 01:50:03.015
When the pressure dropped,
the prop reversed pitch.


1365
01:50:03.516 --> 01:50:05.267
Do you understand me?

1366
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:10.814
Howard, I'm sorry to have to tell you
this now, but there's something else.


1367
01:50:11.191 --> 01:50:13.942
- You following me?
- Yeah.


1368
01:50:15.153 --> 01:50:18.822
The Air Force canceled the contract
on The Hercules.


1369
01:50:21.159 --> 01:50:26.538
The war's over now,
and they say they don't need it anymore.


1370
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.502
I have to know what you want me to do.
Should I release the staff?


1371
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:33.754
How far ...

1372
01:50:35.548 --> 01:50:37.007
... from finishing?

1373
01:50:38.218 --> 01:50:43.055
- About six months.
- No, in money.


1374
01:50:46.309 --> 01:50:48.185
Seven million.

1375
01:50:48.978 --> 01:50:50.354
Maybe more.

1376
01:50:55.735 --> 01:50:57.569
Build it.

1377
01:50:59.072 --> 01:51:01.031
Build it, Odie.

1378
01:51:02.867 --> 01:51:04.409
Howard ...

1379
01:51:05.036 --> 01:51:09.081
... a Constellation crashed
outside Reading, Pennsylvania.


1380
01:51:09.582 --> 01:51:13.001
The Civil Aeronautics Board
has grounded the whole fleet.


1381
01:51:22.971 --> 01:51:24.638
You know ...

1382
01:51:25.723 --> 01:51:28.976
... Juan Trippe sent me flowers.

1383
01:51:31.187 --> 01:51:32.896
Take a look.

1384
01:51:36.651 --> 01:51:41.530
- What did you do with all the others?
- Oh, I had them taken out.


1385
01:51:41.698 --> 01:51:44.867
They ... They attract aphids.

1386
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:50.622
Aphids are ...
They're just awful little creatures.


1387
01:51:51.457 --> 01:51:53.250
But ...

1388
01:51:55.587 --> 01:51:57.671
But these ones ...

1389
01:51:58.631 --> 01:52:02.509
... I wanted to
see these ones every day.

1390
01:52:10.059 --> 01:52:13.061
Can white elephants fly?
That's everybody's question.


1391
01:52:13.229 --> 01:52:18.275
The hull of the world's mightiest airplane,
a flying boat built by Howard Hughes.


1392
01:52:18.443 --> 01:52:22.613
Two hundred and twenty feet long,
it towers higher than a five-story building.


1393
01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:26.783
Power lines have to be cut as it starts
the trip from Culver City ...


1394
01:52:26.951 --> 01:52:28.994
... to the Pacific, 30 miles away.

1395
01:52:29.162 --> 01:52:32.372
Moving the 60-ton load
is quite an engineering problem.


1396
01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:36.501
But you gotta ask, was anything this big
ever supposed to fly?


1397
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:41.173
There goes one wing section,

1398
01:52:41.341 --> 01:52:44.217
Double that and you've got some idea
of the wingspread.


1399
01:52:44.385 --> 01:52:48.680
An airplane that challenges
a mountain for sheer size.


1400
01:52:55.688 --> 01:52:57.940
How long can they keep us grounded?

1401
01:52:58.107 --> 01:53:01.693
Until they finish investigating
the Reading crash. Could be months.


1402
01:53:01.861 --> 01:53:06.782
You're running a $14 million deficit. How
will you afford to keep them out of service?


1403
01:53:06.991 --> 01:53:11.495
- We go international, we'll make it up.
- Brewster's C.A.B. bill isn't going away.


1404
01:53:11.663 --> 01:53:14.373
That bill passes,
and you bought these for nothing.


1405
01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:17.960
- We're fighting the C.A.B. bill.
- Meanwhile, how do we keep TWA flying?


1406
01:53:18.127 --> 01:53:22.714
Don't say, "Just go to Tool Co." We're
pumping every cent into The Hercules ...


1407
01:53:22.882 --> 01:53:25.717
... which the Air Force
doesn't even want anymore.


1408
01:53:25.885 --> 01:53:29.638
I'm glad Jack is feeling sunny about things,
but I've seen the books.


1409
01:53:29.973 --> 01:53:32.391
I'm telling it straight. 
I'm not crying wolf.

1410
01:53:32.558 --> 01:53:35.686
We're in serious trouble.
You've gotta make a choice.


1411
01:53:35.853 --> 01:53:40.899
You wanna be bankrupted
by the big plane or by the big airline?


1412
01:53:48.241 --> 01:53:51.827
Go see Thomas Parkinson
at the Equitable in New York.


1413
01:53:51.995 --> 01:53:55.580
Get a loan against
all the TWA equipment and capital.


1414
01:53:55.748 --> 01:54:01.586
Use the planes as collateral. Hell, use the
desks, use the pens, use everything we got.


1415
01:54:01.754 --> 01:54:05.924
- Try to get me 40 million.
- And if TWA defaults on the loan?


1416
01:54:06.509 --> 01:54:09.428
Then Juan Trippe buys us cheap.

1417
01:54:12.015 --> 01:54:15.100
Under my bed! You put a goddamn
microphone under my bed!


1418
01:54:15.268 --> 01:54:17.436
Listen to me.
I am concerned about you.


1419
01:54:17.603 --> 01:54:20.939
- I just wanna make sure you're okay.
- And who is in that car?!


1420
01:54:21.274 --> 01:54:23.442
It's been with me 24 hours a day.

1421
01:54:23.609 --> 01:54:25.402
That car is for your protection!

1422
01:54:25.570 --> 01:54:29.031
The only one I need protection from is you,
you sick bastard!


1423
01:54:29.198 --> 01:54:30.741
You don't own me, Howard.

1424
01:54:30.908 --> 01:54:34.036
I'm not one of your teenage whores
or some damn airplane.


1425
01:54:34.203 --> 01:54:36.246
I'll have them take all the bugs out.

1426
01:54:36.414 --> 01:54:38.457
I need to know where you are.

1427
01:54:38.624 --> 01:54:41.293
- Why?!
- Because I worry about you, that's why.


1428
01:54:41.461 --> 01:54:43.462
Bullshit!

1429
01:54:45.965 --> 01:54:55.965
What do you mean, "all the bugs"?

1430
01:54:59.062 --> 01:55:01.063
There's more.

1431
01:55:01.314 --> 01:55:03.148
How many?

1432
01:55:03.441 --> 01:55:09.613
I don't know, 12.
Twelve, maybe, and on the telephones.


1433
01:55:10.073 --> 01:55:13.742
Oh, Christ, Howard, on the telephone?

1434
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:15.494
You listen to my phone calls?

1435
01:55:15.661 --> 01:55:19.498
No, no, honey, I would never do that.
I'd never do that.


1436
01:55:19.665 --> 01:55:22.667
I just read the transcripts, that's all.

1437
01:55:27.298 --> 01:55:29.424
What do you wanna know, Howard?

1438
01:55:29.592 --> 01:55:31.760
Was I screwing Artie Shaw last night?

1439
01:55:31.928 --> 01:55:34.638
Was I screwing Sinatra the night before?
You bet.


1440
01:55:34.806 --> 01:55:37.390
Everyone said you were a lunatic,
I didn't listen.


1441
01:55:37.558 --> 01:55:40.477
It's no wonder Kate Hepburn
dumped your demented ass!


1442
01:55:40.645 --> 01:55:43.105
Shut your goddamn mouth.

1443
01:55:47.276 --> 01:55:50.695
Get out, you pathetic freak.

1444
01:55:58.121 --> 01:56:00.288
Get out!

1445
01:56:00.456 --> 01:56:02.124
Is everything all right, sir?

1446
01:56:02.291 --> 01:56:04.626
Take out all the bugs, huh?

1447
01:56:06.754 --> 01:56:08.880
Except for the one
on the bedroom phone.


1448
01:56:09.048 --> 01:56:10.841
Sir, the FBI are at the house.

1449
01:56:12.677 --> 01:56:17.264
This is outrageous! Everything here is the
private property of Hughes Productions.


1450
01:56:17.431 --> 01:56:20.142
- My legal counsel is on the way --
- Federal warrant.


1451
01:56:20.309 --> 01:56:22.561
Don't interfere with the search, sir.

1452
01:56:42.248 --> 01:56:45.750
Dateline: Los Angeles.
Howard Hughes has a new houseguest.


1453
01:56:45.918 --> 01:56:49.546
No, it's not another beautiful starlet.
This time it's the FBI.


1454
01:56:49.714 --> 01:56:53.592
Noah, you've got to help. This is
the 10th time they have been here.


1455
01:56:53.759 --> 01:56:57.262
Rumor has it that agents
working for Senator Owen Brewster ...


1456
01:56:57.430 --> 01:57:01.266
... have practically taken up residence
in the aviation mogul's home.


1457
01:57:01.434 --> 01:57:03.518
Look, I mean, they are touching things.

1458
01:57:03.853 --> 01:57:06.980
- Noah, they are touching things.
- Just keep yourself calm ...


1459
01:57:07.148 --> 01:57:10.192
... and I'll be down there
as soon as I can, Howard.


1460
01:57:10.359 --> 01:57:14.070
Howard?

1461
01:57:38.429 --> 01:57:40.305
Howard, hello.

1462
01:57:40.473 --> 01:57:43.808
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you. Come on inside.


1463
01:57:43.976 --> 01:57:46.519
- Emma, you can start up lunch now.
- Yes, sir.


1464
01:57:46.687 --> 01:57:51.191
Well, really lovely room.
It's nicely decorated.


1465
01:57:51.359 --> 01:57:53.151
Thank you. Here, have a seat.

1466
01:57:53.319 --> 01:57:54.736
Thanks for coming by.

1467
01:57:54.904 --> 01:57:58.031
I thought you and l
should have a chance to talk privately.


1468
01:57:58.199 --> 01:57:59.991
You know, outside the office.

1469
01:58:01.994 --> 01:58:03.328
Well ...

1470
01:58:03.829 --> 01:58:05.830
... I appreciate that, Owen.

1471
01:58:13.214 --> 01:58:18.260
So you're coming out pretty strong
against the C.A.B. bill.


1472
01:58:19.011 --> 01:58:24.099
- You're coming on pretty strong for it.
- Well, it's my bill, Howard, you know.


1473
01:58:24.267 --> 01:58:28.520
Look, I believe sincerely
that America cannot afford ...


1474
01:58:28.688 --> 01:58:31.523
... to have more than one
international carrier.


1475
01:58:33.067 --> 01:58:38.238
I mean, do you think it's fair that one airline
should have a monopoly on international --?


1476
01:58:38.406 --> 01:58:41.783
A monopoly? No, no, no. Oh, no.

1477
01:58:41.951 --> 01:58:47.038
No, I think one airline could do it better,
see, without competition.


1478
01:58:47.373 --> 01:58:52.043
All I'm thinking about are the interests,
the needs of the American passenger.


1479
01:58:52.378 --> 01:58:55.338
That's just beautiful. What is that?

1480
01:58:59.552 --> 01:59:01.845
What is that? Is that a ...?

1481
01:59:02.013 --> 01:59:03.888
Is that a yak?

1482
01:59:04.056 --> 01:59:06.808
- Some kind of a yak?
- No, that's a llama.


1483
01:59:06.976 --> 01:59:09.227
My wife picked that up
when we were in Peru.


1484
01:59:09.395 --> 01:59:11.479
Son of a gun.

1485
01:59:11.647 --> 01:59:14.149
A real llama.

1486
01:59:15.443 --> 01:59:19.070
- From Peru?
- Yeah. From a year ago, I think it was --


1487
01:59:19.238 --> 01:59:22.449
- Yeah, it was about a year ago.
- Lunch is served, senator.


1488
01:59:22.616 --> 01:59:25.118
Good. Okay.
Come on, let's go have some lunch.


1489
01:59:26.704 --> 01:59:30.707
Now, did you --?
Did you actually get to see any llamas?


1490
01:59:30.875 --> 01:59:33.335
No, no. My wife just liked the painting.

1491
01:59:33.502 --> 01:59:36.588
It's an interesting animal.
I'll have to read up on those.


1492
01:59:36.756 --> 01:59:41.176
How do you spell that?
Like ...? Like Fernando Lamas?


1493
01:59:41.552 --> 01:59:45.805
No, no. It's --
It's the animal, it's got two L's.


1494
01:59:45.973 --> 01:59:48.016
Here, come on, have a seat.

1495
01:59:57.151 --> 01:59:59.611
It's brook trout. 
Hope you like fish.

1496
02:00:02.156 --> 02:00:05.784
I love it. Thanks.

1497
02:00:21.008 --> 02:00:25.136
I know you're not a drinking man,
so I hope -- Hope water's okay.


1498
02:00:38.025 --> 02:00:39.651
Thanks.

1499
02:00:45.574 --> 02:00:48.993
All right, let's get down to business.
Let's talk turkey.


1500
02:00:49.829 --> 02:00:52.163
My investigators --

1501
02:00:52.915 --> 02:00:55.750
My investigators
have turned up a lot of dirt.


1502
02:00:56.210 --> 02:00:59.546
It could be really embarrassing
if this stuff got out.


1503
02:01:00.256 --> 02:01:02.799
I'd like to save you
from that embarrassment.


1504
02:01:04.051 --> 02:01:06.177
That's very kind of you, Owen.

1505
02:01:09.181 --> 02:01:13.017
My committee has the power
to hold public hearings.


1506
02:01:14.603 --> 02:01:16.521
I'd like to spare you that.

1507
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:18.440
Would you, now?

1508
02:01:19.775 --> 02:01:21.317
Look ...

1509
02:01:21.485 --> 02:01:26.197
Do you wanna go down in history
as a war profiteer, Howard?


1510
02:01:26.365 --> 02:01:27.615
Is that what you want?

1511
02:01:30.119 --> 02:01:32.370
What do you want, Owen?

1512
02:01:33.914 --> 02:01:40.044
You agree to support my C.A.B. bill,
and I won't hold public hearings.


1513
02:01:40.212 --> 02:01:41.921
- I can't do that.
- Why not?


1514
02:01:42.089 --> 02:01:45.717
I can't do that, Owen.
The C.A.B. would kill TWA.


1515
02:01:45.885 --> 02:01:49.012
Sell TWA to Pan Am.

1516
02:01:49.638 --> 02:01:52.765
You'll get a good price.
You'll get a fair price.


1517
02:01:53.851 --> 02:01:56.060
And then --? Then you won't go public?

1518
02:01:56.228 --> 02:02:01.065
Right. That's right. The investigation's
closed. Nobody knows a thing.


1519
02:02:01.233 --> 02:02:04.235
That's -
- It's better for everybody.

1520
02:02:08.908 --> 02:02:12.452
You know, Owen,
I'm still wondering one thing.


1521
02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:16.331
- What's that?
- The picture of the llama you got last year?


1522
02:02:16.499 --> 02:02:19.167
- Yeah.
- Where'd you sail from?


1523
02:02:19.877 --> 02:02:21.920
We didn't sail. We flew.

1524
02:02:23.255 --> 02:02:25.423
- You flew?
- Yeah.


1525
02:02:33.224 --> 02:02:36.476
Are you sure you
want to do this, Owen?

1526
02:02:37.269 --> 02:02:39.687
You want to go to war with me?

1527
02:02:44.485 --> 02:02:48.821
It isn't me, Howard.
It's the United States government.


1528
02:02:49.782 --> 02:02:52.367
We just beat Germany and Japan.

1529
02:02:52.952 --> 02:02:54.953
Who the hell are you?

1530
02:03:00.209 --> 02:03:04.921
You -- You tell Juan Trippe
something for me, all right?


1531
02:03:05.548 --> 02:03:08.299
Tell him thanks for the flowers.

1532
02:03:08.676 --> 02:03:13.930
And he can kiss
both sides of my ass.

1533
02:03:37.955 --> 02:03:40.415
Well, we have a long list of particulars.

1534
02:03:40.583 --> 02:03:44.752
Chief among them is that he defrauded
the American government ...


1535
02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:48.506
... of $56 million while at war,
when we could least afford it.


1536
02:03:48.674 --> 02:03:51.676
While brave men were dying
on the beaches of Normandy ...


1537
02:03:51.844 --> 02:03:55.305
... Mr. Hughes was picking the pocket
of the American taxpayer.


1538
02:03:55.472 --> 02:03:56.806
I sleep ...

1539
02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:59.851
... in this room ...

1540
02:04:01.604 --> 02:04:03.021
... in the dark.

1541
02:04:03.188 --> 02:04:06.065
I'll have him dragged here to Washington
if I have to.


1542
02:04:06.233 --> 02:04:08.484
I wanna see the whites of his lies.

1543
02:04:08.736 --> 02:04:10.778
I have a place.

1544
02:04:11.530 --> 02:04:15.199
- I can sleep.
- He has a lot of questions to answer.


1545
02:04:15.367 --> 02:04:18.411
- I have a chair.
- Particularly about that monstrous ...


1546
02:04:18.579 --> 02:04:23.041
... boondoggle of his,
that model airplane he's building ...


1547
02:04:23.208 --> 02:04:27.837
... that flying lumberyard,
that spruce goose.


1548
02:04:29.465 --> 02:04:31.841
No, he'll -
- We'll get him here.

1549
02:04:35.387 --> 02:04:36.846
That's just beautiful.

1550
02:04:37.848 --> 02:04:41.434
Oh, yeah. I like the desert.

1551
02:04:43.354 --> 02:04:47.106
It's hot there in the desert,
but it's clean.


1552
02:04:47.691 --> 02:04:49.359
It's clean.

1553
02:04:51.070 --> 02:04:53.029
I need to sleep.

1554
02:04:55.908 --> 02:05:04.582
I should drink something first.

1555
02:05:09.254 --> 02:05:11.005
Wait a minute.

1556
02:05:12.383 --> 02:05:13.925
What if that milk is sour?

1557
02:05:15.135 --> 02:05:16.761
That milk is bad.

1558
02:05:17.513 --> 02:05:22.475
I shouldn't pick up
the bottle of milk with my right hand.


1559
02:05:22.893 --> 02:05:29.148
And I shouldn't take the top off
with my left hand ...


1560
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:33.277
... put it in my pocket.

1561
02:05:33.445 --> 02:05:36.030
My left pocket.

1562
02:05:52.798 --> 02:05:57.093
Howard, it's Kate.
I need -- I need to talk to you.


1563
02:05:58.303 --> 02:06:00.263
Can you hear me?

1564
02:06:02.725 --> 02:06:04.726
I'm coming in.

1565
02:06:09.565 --> 02:06:12.316
Howard, unlock this door immediately.

1566
02:06:20.826 --> 02:06:23.244
I can't, sweetie.

1567
02:06:26.165 --> 02:06:28.040
You mean you won't.

1568
02:06:29.918 --> 02:06:33.337
Howard, please let me see you.

1569
02:06:33.505 --> 02:06:38.676
- I haven't shaved.
- Well, neither have l.


1570
02:06:41.889 --> 02:06:43.723
Come on.

1571
02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:45.600
You ...

1572
02:06:45.768 --> 02:06:48.227
You let me in.

1573
02:06:53.942 --> 02:06:56.319
I can hear you, Katie.

1574
02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:03.284
I could always hear you.
Even in the cockpit, with the engines on.


1575
02:07:03.952 --> 02:07:07.371
That's because I'm so goddamn loud.

1576
02:07:12.127 --> 02:07:14.045
Howard, I ...

1577
02:07:16.131 --> 02:07:18.549
I came to thank you.

1578
02:07:19.384 --> 02:07:22.595
I found out what you did
for Spence and me.


1579
02:07:22.763 --> 02:07:26.057
Buying those awful pictures.

1580
02:07:30.687 --> 02:07:32.355
You love him.

1581
02:07:39.071 --> 02:07:41.739
He's everything I have.

1582
02:07:49.748 --> 02:07:51.791
Howard?

1583
02:07:52.751 --> 02:07:55.211
I'm glad for you, Kate.

1584
02:07:56.547 --> 02:07:58.965
Go away now. Would you do that?

1585
02:08:00.384 --> 02:08:03.636
- Howard, please.
- Go away.


1586
02:08:03.804 --> 02:08:07.223
Just for now. I'll see you soon.

1587
02:08:07.391 --> 02:08:09.767
- We'll go flying together.
- Yes.


1588
02:08:09.935 --> 02:08:12.812
Yes, please. You take me flying again.

1589
02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:15.815
Howard, I can take the wheel.

1590
02:08:21.655 --> 02:08:23.281
Howard?

1591
02:08:29.746 --> 02:08:31.789
Howard, are you --? 
Are you there?

1592
02:08:37.504 --> 02:08:39.171
Howard?

1593
02:08:40.966 --> 02:08:42.842
Howard, are you there?

1594
02:08:45.304 --> 02:08:47.346
Come on, Howard.

1595
02:08:50.309 --> 02:08:52.226
Howard, are you there?

1596
02:09:18.503 --> 02:09:25.426
Come in with the milk.

1597
02:09:25.719 --> 02:09:28.763
He is to open the bag
with his right hand ...


1598
02:09:28.931 --> 02:09:32.016
... and hold the bag out to me
at a 45-degree angle ...


1599
02:09:32.184 --> 02:09:35.519
... so I may reach
into the bag without ...

1600
02:09:37.564 --> 02:09:39.815
Without touching the paper.

1601
02:09:44.821 --> 02:09:52.453
Repeated from the beginning.

1602
02:10:02.881 --> 02:10:07.218
If there is any variation
of these instructions ...


1603
02:10:07.386 --> 02:10:10.721
... even to the smallest degree ...

1604
02:10:10.889 --> 02:10:15.101
... the entire process must be repeated ...

1605
02:10:15.268 --> 02:10:17.728
... from the beginning.
- Come in with the milk.


1606
02:10:17.896 --> 02:10:20.648
- Repeated from the beginning.
- Come in with the milk.


1607
02:10:20.816 --> 02:10:22.566
- Come in with the milk.
- Repeated ...


1608
02:10:22.734 --> 02:10:24.485
... from the beginning.

1609
02:10:24.653 --> 02:10:26.612
Repeated from the beginning.

1610
02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:28.489
Come in with the milk.

1611
02:10:28.657 --> 02:10:30.574
Q ...

1612
02:10:32.411 --> 02:10:33.703

I ...

1627

Howard?

1628
02:11:26.131 --> 02:11:27.673
Hello?

1629
02:11:30.052 --> 02:11:31.427
Who is it?

1630
02:11:31.595 --> 02:11:33.596
Howard, it's Juan.

1631
02:11:42.064 --> 02:11:43.981
Juan.

1632
02:11:44.566 --> 02:11:46.817
Juan, right. Yeah.

1633
02:11:46.985 --> 02:11:49.779
We had an appointment, right? Yeah.

1634
02:11:50.447 --> 02:11:52.907
I remember that. Look ...

1635
02:11:53.075 --> 02:11:55.868
... I got a hell of a cold in here.
A hell of a cold.


1636
02:11:56.036 --> 02:11:59.455
So take a seat out there,
because I don't wanna get you sick.


1637
02:11:59.915 --> 02:12:05.002
I'd never forgive myself if I got you sick.
I don't wanna get you sick. I don't wanna --


1638
02:12:12.177 --> 02:12:14.011
Thank you.

1639
02:12:16.598 --> 02:12:18.349
Okay, Howard, I'm sitting.

1640
02:12:19.017 --> 02:12:22.103
I've brought along our accountings.
Now ...


1641
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:25.439
... Pan Am is trading
at 13 and five-eighths.


1642
02:12:25.607 --> 02:12:28.234
TWA at four and a quarter.

1643
02:12:28.401 --> 02:12:29.860
- Now, if you take --
- Come on.


1644
02:12:30.028 --> 02:12:35.324
Come on, come on, come on.
We both know I'm not gonna sell TWA.


1645
02:12:35.492 --> 02:12:37.535
Besides, you couldn't afford her.

1646
02:12:37.702 --> 02:12:41.497
Our domestic routes alone
are worth more than twice Pan Am.


1647
02:12:42.082 --> 02:12:45.334
Well, considering our stock is trading
at three times yours ...


1648
02:12:45.502 --> 02:12:48.546
... I find that a dubious claim, Howard.

1649
02:12:48.713 --> 02:12:50.089
What I --

1650
02:12:52.217 --> 02:12:56.804
What I mean is,
you have no domestic routes. All right?


1651
02:12:56.972 --> 02:12:59.098
I mean, you get TWA,
you span the globe.


1652
02:12:59.266 --> 02:13:01.976
I'm not gonna sell,
and you know I'm not gonna sell.


1653
02:13:02.144 --> 02:13:04.019
Here's the point.

1654
02:13:04.187 --> 02:13:06.647
Owen Brewster works for you.

1655
02:13:07.232 --> 02:13:13.070
Howard, I didn't elect Senator Brewster.
We can thank the voters of Maine for that.


1656
02:13:20.745 --> 02:13:26.208
Now, if I appear at his hearings, Juan,
it could get nasty.


1657
02:13:26.376 --> 02:13:28.419
Real nasty for all of us.

1658
02:13:28.587 --> 02:13:32.923
Well, I think,
considerably more so for you.


1659
02:13:33.341 --> 02:13:36.552
While the good people of America
were losing sons at Anzio ...


1660
02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:40.431
... you produced a dirty movie
and built airplanes that don't fly.


1661
02:13:40.599 --> 02:13:43.184
Well, that's just not fair, is it?

1662
02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:47.146
I mean, the XF-11 flew quite well
for an hour and 45 minutes.


1663
02:13:47.314 --> 02:13:51.609
I wish you were up there with me, Juan.
It was exhilarating.


1664
02:13:52.569 --> 02:13:55.946
Be that as it may, you still have
to answer for the Spruce Goose.


1665
02:13:56.698 --> 02:13:59.158
It's called The Hercules!

1666
02:13:59.326 --> 02:14:02.578
And it will fly, goddamn it!

1667
02:14:02.746 --> 02:14:06.790
I hope so. The American people deserve
something for their $13 million.


1668
02:14:06.958 --> 02:14:09.960
I won't sell TWA!

1669
02:14:10.128 --> 02:14:11.295
I won't!

1670
02:14:16.301 --> 02:14:18.302
I know that, Howard.

1671
02:14:19.095 --> 02:14:20.804
I know that.

1672
02:14:22.599 --> 02:14:25.226
But I'm going to get it anyway.

1673
02:14:26.186 --> 02:14:30.064
You will default on your loan from
Equitable after Senator Brewster ...


1674
02:14:30.232 --> 02:14:34.526
... destroys your reputation and you can't
find additional capital for the airline.


1675
02:14:34.694 --> 02:14:39.907
The hearings will also show Hughes Aircraft
to be mismanaged and incompetent ...


1676
02:14:40.075 --> 02:14:42.159
... and it will go bankrupt too.

1677
02:14:42.327 --> 02:14:45.871
But you won't be insolvent.
You'll still have Tool Co.


1678
02:14:46.039 --> 02:14:49.875
Perhaps you'll head back to Houston
to rebuild your empire.


1679
02:14:50.126 --> 02:14:52.253
I rather hope you do.

1680
02:14:52.671 --> 02:14:56.006
By that time,
Pan Am will have bought TWA ...


1681
02:14:56.174 --> 02:15:00.219
... and painted all those magnificent
Connies blue and white.


1682
02:15:00.387 --> 02:15:05.266
So when you do return,
it will be on a Pan Am plane.


1683
02:15:08.687 --> 02:15:10.354
Well ...

1684
02:15:12.357 --> 02:15:15.442
You seem to have me
in a corner here, buddy.


1685
02:15:16.444 --> 02:15:19.613
Not a position in which
I'm very comfortable.


1686
02:15:21.199 --> 02:15:25.077
I think you're gonna be less comfortable
at Senator Brewster's hearings.


1687
02:15:26.204 --> 02:15:28.539
Very public, Howard.

1688
02:15:30.542 --> 02:15:33.961
Lots of cameras and newsmen.

1689
02:15:34.212 --> 02:15:37.965
I understand you're not
particularly fond of crowds.


1690
02:15:39.843 --> 02:15:43.012
Perhaps we should spare you that.

1691
02:15:44.889 --> 02:15:49.852
Well, thank you for your concern, Juan.

1692
02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:52.021
I find that ...

1693
02:15:53.148 --> 02:15:55.316
... very moving.

1694
02:15:56.067 --> 02:15:58.068
It's been a real pleasure.

1695
02:15:59.738 --> 02:16:02.823
Noah will see you back
to the airport now.


1696
02:16:03.825 --> 02:16:11.248
You fly safe.

1697
02:16:16.171 --> 02:16:18.922
Thank you, Howard,
and you take care of that cold.


1698
02:16:19.090 --> 02:16:21.008
Don't you worry.

1699
02:16:21.176 --> 02:16:23.344
I certainly will.

1700
02:16:24.262 --> 02:16:26.013
Bye-bye.

1701
02:16:30.685 --> 02:16:35.439
If you let him appear at those hearings,
the whole world will see what he's become.


1702
02:16:35.607 --> 02:16:38.525
People should remember him as he was.

1703
02:16:43.698 --> 02:16:47.201
He'll have a subpoena in three days
to appear in Washington.


1704
02:16:48.453 --> 02:16:51.038
If you can get him
out of there by then.

1705
02:17:40.839 --> 02:17:42.673
Mr. Hughes?

1706
02:17:48.763 --> 02:17:51.098
I don't have any shoes.

1707
02:17:52.934 --> 02:17:55.811
- Could you get me some shoes?
- Shoes.


1708
02:17:56.563 --> 02:17:58.105
Yeah.

1709
02:18:23.506 --> 02:18:26.133
How nice of you to dress for me.

1710
02:18:29.387 --> 02:18:31.513
Can I come in?

1711
02:18:32.307 --> 02:18:36.685
Yeah, you can come in.

1712
02:18:43.526 --> 02:18:45.486
Thank you for coming.

1713
02:18:57.916 --> 02:18:59.958
Now, let's get a drink.

1714
02:19:00.126 --> 02:19:04.254
Wait, wait, wait, honey.
You can't move. You're safe here.


1715
02:19:04.422 --> 02:19:07.549
You're in the germ-free zone now.
You understand?


1716
02:19:07.717 --> 02:19:13.180
- I'll take my chances.
- No, no, honey. Wait, wait.


1717
02:19:26.277 --> 02:19:28.695
Love what you've done with the place.

1718
02:19:35.495 --> 02:19:39.581
Now, let me look at you.

1719
02:19:44.295 --> 02:19:46.713
When do you go to Washington?

1720
02:19:47.215 --> 02:19:49.132
A week.

1721
02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:52.177
No, no. Just under a week.

1722
02:19:52.345 --> 02:19:56.807
I don't know the date today,
but I have to be ...


1723
02:19:56.975 --> 02:19:59.560
All right, take it easy.

1724
02:20:12.490 --> 02:20:15.158
There's nothing there, Howard.

1725
02:20:22.083 --> 02:20:25.502
I see things.

1726
02:20:26.337 --> 02:20:28.255
I know, baby.

1727
02:20:29.382 --> 02:20:31.758
Rinse your face off, now.

1728
02:20:40.685 --> 02:20:43.186
Put your hands in the water
and wash off the soap.


1729
02:20:43.354 --> 02:20:46.607
I'm right here. 
I'm not going anywhere.

1730
02:20:51.029 --> 02:20:54.489
- Does that look clean to you?
- Nothing's clean, Howard.


1731
02:20:54.657 --> 02:20:57.659
But we do our best, right?

1732
02:20:58.369 --> 02:21:00.120
Yeah.

1733
02:21:19.474 --> 02:21:21.183
What do you think?

1734
02:21:21.351 --> 02:21:24.770
- Well, I look all right.
- You look great.


1735
02:21:24.937 --> 02:21:26.605
Will you marry me?

1736
02:21:26.773 --> 02:21:29.483
You're too crazy for me.

1737
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:33.487
I gotta go, baby.

1738
02:21:34.238 --> 02:21:36.073
Okay.

1739
02:21:36.783 --> 02:21:38.492
Thanks.

1740
02:21:44.415 --> 02:21:46.667
You'd do it for me.

1741
02:21:53.049 --> 02:21:55.008
Hi, Howard. How you doing?

1742
02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:38.135
The committee will come to order.

1743
02:22:38.803 --> 02:22:43.515
Ladies and gentlemen, I must insist that
we maintain quiet during these proceedings.


1744
02:22:43.683 --> 02:22:46.935
All right, Mr. Hughes,
will you stand and be sworn?


1745
02:22:48.896 --> 02:22:52.941
Do you solemnly swear that in the matter
now pending before this committee ...


1746
02:22:53.109 --> 02:22:57.237
... you will tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?


1747
02:22:57.405 --> 02:22:59.656
- I do.
- Pardon me for speaking loudly ...


1748
02:22:59.824 --> 02:23:04.077
... but I know you have difficulty hearing.
- That's quite all right.


1749
02:23:04.370 --> 02:23:07.956
I mean, everybody knows I'm deaf.
I'm not gonna try to hide it.


1750
02:23:10.334 --> 02:23:13.003
Mr. Hughes, it is the intention
of this committee --


1751
02:23:13.171 --> 02:23:14.755
Mr. Hughes has a statement.

1752
02:23:16.090 --> 02:23:22.012
All right, you may proceed
with this statement, Mr. Hughes.


1753
02:23:28.311 --> 02:23:30.604
Mr. Hughes, do you have a statement?

1754
02:23:37.945 --> 02:23:42.199
I'm gonna attempt to be honest here.

1755
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:47.954
I mean, my reputation's being destroyed,
so I might as well lay the cards on the table.


1756
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:52.876
Senator Brewster, if you hadn't
gone too far overboard ...


1757
02:23:53.044 --> 02:23:55.712
... if you hadn't put
the red-hot iron in my side ...


1758
02:23:55.880 --> 02:24:00.383
... I might have been willing to take a
shellacking in this publicity spree of yours.


1759
02:24:00.551 --> 02:24:06.139
I may have been willing to sit back and take
a certain amount of abuse simply because ...


1760
02:24:06.891 --> 02:24:09.476
... well, I am only a private citizen.

1761
02:24:09.644 --> 02:24:11.728
Whereas you are a senator ...

1762
02:24:11.896 --> 02:24:14.815
... with all sorts of powers.

1763
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:18.568
But I think this goddamn circus
has gone on long enough!


1764
02:24:18.736 --> 02:24:22.614
- That's quite sufficient.
- You have called me a liar, sir, in the press.


1765
02:24:22.782 --> 02:24:25.826
You have called me a liar
and a thief and a war profiteer!


1766
02:24:25.993 --> 02:24:29.955
- The witness will restrain --
- Why not tell the truth for once, senator?


1767
02:24:30.122 --> 02:24:34.584
Why not tell the truth that this investigation
was really born on the day that TWA ...


1768
02:24:34.752 --> 02:24:40.340
... decided to fly to Europe? On the day that
TWA first invaded Juan Trippe's territory!


1769
02:24:40.508 --> 02:24:43.051
- Sit down.
- On the day TWA first challenged ...


1770
02:24:43.219 --> 02:24:47.764
... the generally accepted theory that only
Juan Trippe's great Pan American Airways ...


1771
02:24:47.932 --> 02:24:52.060
... had the right to fly the Atlantic!
- You are not here to make a speech.


1772
02:24:53.062 --> 02:24:56.523
I asked for silence!
I asked for quiet in this room ...


1773
02:24:56.691 --> 02:25:00.735
We have in our possession receipts
in the amount of $170,000 ...


1774
02:25:02.071 --> 02:25:06.366
... acquired from Mr. John Meyer.
Mr. Meyer works for you, does he not?


1775
02:25:06.534 --> 02:25:10.704
- He does.
- And what is his official title?


1776
02:25:11.622 --> 02:25:15.166
I don't exactly know, senator.
A lot of people work for me.


1777
02:25:15.334 --> 02:25:18.128
Can you explain why your press agent
would pay out ...


1778
02:25:18.296 --> 02:25:23.300
... more than $170,000 to representatives
of the United States Air Force?


1779
02:25:23.467 --> 02:25:27.929
- I don't know. You'd have to ask him.
- Well, would you produce him?


1780
02:25:28.806 --> 02:25:31.975
- Produce him?
- Will you cause him to appear?


1781
02:25:32.143 --> 02:25:35.395
You had John Meyer on the stand
for three days last week.


1782
02:25:35.563 --> 02:25:38.315
Be that as it may,
we would like him to reappear.


1783
02:25:38.482 --> 02:25:41.985
Would you ask him to return?

1784
02:25:47.992 --> 02:25:50.243
No, I don't think I will.

1785
02:25:51.871 --> 02:25:55.081
Will you try to have him return?

1786
02:25:57.168 --> 02:26:01.630
- No, I don't think I'll try.
- You don't think you'll try?


1787
02:26:02.673 --> 02:26:05.675
No, I don't think so.

1788
02:26:05.843 --> 02:26:10.680
The $170,000 paid out to the Air Force
in the form of hotel suites ...


1789
02:26:10.848 --> 02:26:12.474
... TWA stock ...

1790
02:26:13.142 --> 02:26:15.602
... female companionship.

1791
02:26:15.811 --> 02:26:20.106
Now, is it possible that
these could be considered bribes?


1792
02:26:20.775 --> 02:26:23.109
I suppose you could call them that, yes.

1793
02:26:24.487 --> 02:26:25.862
Would you repeat that?

1794
02:26:26.822 --> 02:26:30.659
I said, I suppose you could
consider them bribes, yes.


1795
02:26:33.287 --> 02:26:36.122
Well, would you like
to explain that, Mr. Hughes?


1796
02:26:37.833 --> 02:26:42.045
I'm afraid you don't know how
the aviation business works, senator.


1797
02:26:42.213 --> 02:26:46.633
See, wining and dining Air Force dignitaries
is common in our business.


1798
02:26:46.801 --> 02:26:51.721
It's because we all want the big contracts.
All the major aircraft companies do it.


1799
02:26:51.889 --> 02:26:54.057
I don't know whether
it's a good system ...


1800
02:26:54.225 --> 02:26:58.478
... I just know it's not illegal.
You, senator, you are the lawmaker.


1801
02:26:58.646 --> 02:27:03.233
If you pass a law that states no one
can entertain Air Force officers, well, hell ...


1802
02:27:03.401 --> 02:27:05.568
... I'd be happy to abide by it.

1803
02:27:07.655 --> 02:27:11.074
Your story is a pack of lies. I can
tear it apart if allowed to cross-examine.


1804
02:27:12.410 --> 02:27:16.705
- We're not gonna have this bickering.
- Yes. Somewhere between two and 500 ...


1805
02:27:16.872 --> 02:27:20.750
... if you'll let me get started.
- If you believe your wealth and power ...


1806
02:27:20.918 --> 02:27:24.879
... can intimidate any member
of this committee, you're mistaken.


1807
02:27:25.047 --> 02:27:27.924
- Now submit your questions.
- I'll put this very simply.


1808
02:27:28.092 --> 02:27:31.136
On February 12th,
at the Mayflower Hotel ...


1809
02:27:31.303 --> 02:27:36.933
... did you or did you not tell me
that if I were to sell TWA to Pan Am ...


1810
02:27:37.101 --> 02:27:39.894
... that this entire investigation
would be called off?


1811
02:27:40.062 --> 02:27:43.773
I did not. And I have asked you
to submit your questions in writing.


1812
02:27:43.941 --> 02:27:47.902
- How long have you known Juan Trippe?
- I've known him for some time now.


1813
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:52.782
- And that's not the question.
- Is it not true that Juan donated $20,000 ...


1814
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:57.203
... to your last campaign? I mean,
he spoke to me as if you worked for him.


1815
02:28:01.250 --> 02:28:03.126
I have a personal friendship with --

1816
02:28:03.294 --> 02:28:06.713
Is it true you accept free Pan Am tickets
to circle the globe ...


1817
02:28:06.881 --> 02:28:09.799
... in support of your C.A.B. bill?
- No, it is not true.


1818
02:28:09.967 --> 02:28:14.179
Well, who wrote that bill, senator?
Who actually wrote the C.A.B. bill?


1819
02:28:14.346 --> 02:28:18.308
- The actual words. Did you write them?
- This is not how these hearings ...


1820
02:28:18.476 --> 02:28:22.562
... are gonna be conducted.
- I have it. Maybe it'll refresh your memory.


1821
02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:27.317
"Bill S-987 to amend
the Civil Aeronautics Act."


1822
02:28:27.485 --> 02:28:30.320
Now, you introduced this bill
to the Senate.


1823
02:28:32.782 --> 02:28:34.908
A lot of words.

1824
02:28:35.242 --> 02:28:37.243
You write all of them?

1825
02:28:37.828 --> 02:28:40.705
- Did you write any of them, senator?
- Now, look --


1826
02:28:40.873 --> 02:28:43.875
Now, this entire bill was written
by Pan Am executives ...


1827
02:28:44.043 --> 02:28:48.338
... and designed to give that airline
a monopoly on international travel.


1828
02:28:48.506 --> 02:28:52.967
You've been flogging this bill all around
the world on their behalf, have you not?


1829
02:28:53.135 --> 02:28:56.888
I have duties that take me
all over the world, Mr. Hughes.


1830
02:28:57.056 --> 02:29:02.102
Well, what the hell does a senator
from Maine need to visit Peru for?


1831
02:29:02.853 --> 02:29:07.524
I was seeking outlets for our trade goods.

1832
02:29:08.484 --> 02:29:11.444
Buy a lot of
lobsters down there, do they?

1833
02:29:14.031 --> 02:29:17.826
Senator, how many times have you visited
Trippe's office in New York ...


1834
02:29:17.993 --> 02:29:20.370
... in the last three months?

1835
02:29:22.957 --> 02:29:25.708
Would you like me to tell you, senator?

1836
02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:29.921
All right, this has gone on long enough.
Juan is a great American.


1837
02:29:30.089 --> 02:29:34.467
His airline has advanced the cause
of commercial aviation for decades.


1838
02:29:34.635 --> 02:29:40.181
Juan Trippe is a patriot. Juan Trippe is not
a man who is interested in making money.


1839
02:29:41.058 --> 02:29:44.853
Well, I'm sure his stockholders
would be happy to hear that.


1840
02:29:46.522 --> 02:29:48.022
We're gonna clear this room.

1841
02:29:48.566 --> 02:29:53.361
This is James McNamara speaking to you
from the Hughes 2000-ton flying boat ...


1842
02:29:53.529 --> 02:29:56.698
... the world's largest aircraft.
This is the sky giant ...


1843
02:29:56.866 --> 02:30:00.952
... which has prompted Congress to
investigate the war contracts of Mr. Hughes.


1844
02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:04.706
Before boarding the craft,
Mr. Hughes told newsmen that this test ...


1845
02:30:04.874 --> 02:30:09.085
... would be solely a taxi experiment.
He said he didn't know what might happen.


1846
02:30:09.253 --> 02:30:11.129
The mammoth flying plywood shell ...

1847
02:30:13.215 --> 02:30:16.968
... might ship water under high-speed
taxi pressure. He will not take ...


1848
02:30:17.136 --> 02:30:20.430
... the craft into the air until next spring.
The thin man from Culver City ...


1849
02:30:20.598 --> 02:30:25.101
... pronounced the craft an unknown
quantity. He has an idea what it can do ...


1850
02:30:25.269 --> 02:30:27.270
None of that, now. None of that.

1851
02:30:27.438 --> 02:30:30.356
We are about 5 feet
in back of Mr. Hughes.


1852
02:30:30.524 --> 02:30:33.902
We are looking through
one of the side windows in the cockpit.


1853
02:30:34.069 --> 02:30:36.613
Professor, why don't you
come on up front here.


1854
02:30:37.031 --> 02:30:40.283
In other words, we are 30 feet high
in this aircraft.


1855
02:30:40.451 --> 02:30:45.079
Strap yourself in right there.
You ought to be able to see just great.


1856
02:30:46.081 --> 02:30:49.334
Huge crowds jam the surrounding
shoreline this morning.


1857
02:30:49.501 --> 02:30:52.712
All right, boys, let's fire it up.

1858
02:30:56.592 --> 02:30:57.967
One's good.

1859
02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:01.179
Two's good.

1860
02:31:01.347 --> 02:31:03.056
Three's good.

1861
02:31:03.224 --> 02:31:05.266
Four's good.

1862
02:31:05.434 --> 02:31:07.143
Five's good.

1863
02:31:07.311 --> 02:31:08.811
Six is good.

1864
02:31:08.979 --> 02:31:10.313
Seven's good.

1865
02:31:10.481 --> 02:31:12.398
Eight's good.

1866
02:31:13.484 --> 02:31:17.320
- Advancing master throttles.
- Advancing master throttles.


1867
02:31:18.948 --> 02:31:21.658
As you probably know,
I have to do a great deal ...


1868
02:31:21.825 --> 02:31:23.952
... of screaming into our microphone.

1869
02:31:24.119 --> 02:31:28.498
- Understood. Lower it 15 degrees of flaps.
- Lowering 15 degrees of flaps.


1870
02:31:29.166 --> 02:31:32.919
Howard, she's gotta hit 70
to have any kind of chance.


1871
02:31:33.087 --> 02:31:35.338
Yeah, I know. I know.

1872
02:31:35.506 --> 02:31:39.842
It's a beautiful day here off the coast
of Southern California. Blue skies ...


1873
02:31:40.010 --> 02:31:43.513
... a warm sun ...
- Twenty-five miles per hour.


1874
02:31:43.681 --> 02:31:45.932
- And a relatively calm sea ...
- Thirty.


1875
02:31:47.559 --> 02:31:48.851
Thirty-five.

1876
02:31:49.019 --> 02:31:52.981
One would think these eight power plants
might shake the craft to pieces ...


1877
02:31:53.357 --> 02:31:54.941
Take it easy, Howard.

1878
02:31:57.236 --> 02:32:01.030
- Forty!
- Throttling back for starboard turn 180.


1879
02:32:01.198 --> 02:32:03.533
Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

1880
02:32:08.789 --> 02:32:11.291
The flight crew itself
consists of four men.


1881
02:32:11.458 --> 02:32:15.503
Mr. Hughes, however, has added 11
maintenance men to this maiden taxi test ...


1882
02:32:15.671 --> 02:32:21.301
... stationed at various places throughout the
ship, checking points of stress and strain.


1883
02:32:23.721 --> 02:32:25.388
How does she sound, Odie?

1884
02:32:26.307 --> 02:32:28.308
Sounds good, Howard.

1885
02:32:31.603 --> 02:32:33.730
- Professor.
- Yes?


1886
02:32:33.897 --> 02:32:35.815
Would you do me a favor?

1887
02:32:36.275 --> 02:32:40.320
Would you take a look out that window
and tell me what the wind is doing?


1888
02:32:45.367 --> 02:32:49.704
I would say that
we have a 15-knot wind.

1889
02:32:49.872 --> 02:32:53.249
Would you call that a headwind,
professor?


1890
02:32:53.959 --> 02:32:56.169
I would, Mr. Hughes.

1891
02:32:56.337 --> 02:32:59.922
We must maintain silence. We must
have quiet during the proceedings.


1892
02:33:00.090 --> 02:33:02.425
Mr. Hughes, will you stand and be sworn?

1893
02:33:02.593 --> 02:33:05.053
Mr. Hughes, did you receive ...

1894
02:33:05.220 --> 02:33:11.601
... $43 million to manufacture 100 XF-11
spy planes for the United States Air Force?


1895
02:33:12.853 --> 02:33:14.020
I did.

1896
02:33:14.313 --> 02:33:18.441
How many functional planes did you
deliver to the United States Air Force?


1897
02:33:18.776 --> 02:33:19.776
None.

1898
02:33:19.943 --> 02:33:23.196
Would you lean a little closer
to the microphones, sir?


1899
02:33:23.697 --> 02:33:24.864
None.

1900
02:33:25.032 --> 02:33:28.951
Did you receive $13 million
to manufacture ...


1901
02:33:29.119 --> 02:33:33.915
... a prototype of a flying boat
known as The Hercules?


1902
02:33:35.459 --> 02:33:36.751
I did.

1903
02:33:36.919 --> 02:33:39.504
And did you deliver that plane?

1904
02:33:39.797 --> 02:33:41.089
I did not.

1905
02:33:42.174 --> 02:33:45.468
So by your admission
in this chamber, Mr. Hughes ...


1906
02:33:45.636 --> 02:33:48.554
... you have received $56 million ...

1907
02:33:48.931 --> 02:33:53.142
... from the United States government
for planes you never delivered.


1908
02:33:53.977 --> 02:33:55.770
That is correct.

1909
02:33:58.190 --> 02:34:01.192
Well, excuse me for asking,
Mr. Hughes ...


1910
02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:03.319
... but where did all that money go?

1911
02:34:03.695 --> 02:34:08.241
Well, it went into the planes, senator.
And a lot more.


1912
02:34:08.409 --> 02:34:13.204
More? Do tell, Mr. Hughes,
what other larcenies did you commit?


1913
02:34:13.414 --> 02:34:18.668
I mean, I put my money
into the planes, senator. My money.


1914
02:34:21.171 --> 02:34:25.716
- See, the thing is that I care --
- Your personal finances are not --


1915
02:34:25.884 --> 02:34:28.594
Let him speak.

1916
02:34:31.932 --> 02:34:33.266
Proceed, Mr. Hughes.

1917
02:34:35.352 --> 02:34:40.690
See, the thing is,
I care very much about aviation.


1918
02:34:40.941 --> 02:34:45.611
It has been the great joy of my life. That's
why I put my own money into these planes.


1919
02:34:45.779 --> 02:34:50.199
And I've lost millions, senator,
and I'll go on losing millions. It's just ...


1920
02:34:50.367 --> 02:34:52.285
... what I do.

1921
02:34:52.619 --> 02:34:56.956
Now, if I've lost a lot of the government's
money during the war, I hope folks ...


1922
02:34:57.124 --> 02:34:59.709
... will put that into perspective.

1923
02:34:59.877 --> 02:35:03.212
More than 60 other airplanes ordered
from such firms as ...


1924
02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:07.383
... Lockheed, Douglas, Northrop and Boeing
never saw action either.


1925
02:35:07.551 --> 02:35:14.056
In all, more than $800 million was spent
during the war on planes that never flew.


1926
02:35:14.224 --> 02:35:19.353
Over 6 billion on other weapons
that were never delivered.


1927
02:35:19.521 --> 02:35:23.983
Yet Hughes Aircraft, with her 56 million ...

1928
02:35:24.151 --> 02:35:26.652
... is the only firm
under investigation here.


1929
02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:32.408
I cannot help but think that has a little more
to do with TWA than planes that did not fly.


1930
02:35:32.576 --> 02:35:36.537
- You've made your point, Mr. Hughes.
- One second. I have one more thing ...


1931
02:35:36.914 --> 02:35:39.165
... to say here to this committee.

1932
02:35:39.333 --> 02:35:41.876
And that has to do with The Hercules.

1933
02:35:42.503 --> 02:35:47.757
Now, I am supposed to be many things
which are not complimentary.


1934
02:35:47.925 --> 02:35:49.967
I am supposed to be capricious.

1935
02:35:50.135 --> 02:35:54.096
I have been called a playboy.
I've even been called an eccentric ...


1936
02:35:54.264 --> 02:35:58.518
... but I do not believe that I have
the reputation of being a liar.


1937
02:35:59.478 --> 02:36:02.855
Needless to say, The Hercules
was a monumental undertaking.


1938
02:36:03.023 --> 02:36:05.733
It is the largest plane ever built.

1939
02:36:05.901 --> 02:36:09.779
It is over five stories tall with a wingspan
longer than a football field.


1940
02:36:09.947 --> 02:36:11.781
That's more than a city block.

1941
02:36:11.949 --> 02:36:16.494
Now, I put the sweat of my life into this.
I got my reputation all rolled up in it.


1942
02:36:16.662 --> 02:36:20.122
I have stated several times
that if The Hercules fails to fly ...


1943
02:36:20.290 --> 02:36:24.418
... I will leave this country
and never come back. And I mean it.


1944
02:36:25.796 --> 02:36:29.632
Now, Senator Brewster,
you can subpoena me ...


1945
02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:34.637
... you can arrest me, you can even claim
I've folded up and taken a run-out powder ...


1946
02:36:34.805 --> 02:36:39.809
... but, well, I've had just about enough
of this nonsense. Good afternoon.


1947
02:36:40.227 --> 02:36:41.477
I had to do it.

1948
02:36:41.645 --> 02:36:45.606
- Mr. Hughes.
- Mr. Hughes.


1949
02:36:45.774 --> 02:36:48.317
I'd love to see
The Hercules in the air.

1950
02:36:48.485 --> 02:36:50.903
Thank you, thank you so much.

1951
02:36:59.913 --> 02:37:00.997
Switch it off.

1952
02:37:01.164 --> 02:37:04.000
- The hearings aren't over yet.
- The hearings are over.


1953
02:37:06.712 --> 02:37:09.547
The airline bill will be defeated
in the Senate.


1954
02:37:09.715 --> 02:37:12.800
TWA will begin flights from
New York to Paris ...


1955
02:37:12.968 --> 02:37:18.764
... then on to Moscow, to Japan,
to Hawaii, to Los Angeles ...


1956
02:37:20.892 --> 02:37:22.935
... to New York.

1957
02:37:26.773 --> 02:37:28.441
Fuck.

1958
02:37:32.487 --> 02:37:36.324
- Power coming up.
- Power coming up.


1959
02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:41.871
Howard Hughes has just alerted us.

1960
02:37:42.039 --> 02:37:46.626
He has asked everyone to hold on.
Tremendous horsepower kicking up.


1961
02:37:48.211 --> 02:37:49.337
Let me hear it, Odie.

1962
02:37:49.504 --> 02:37:51.547
Twenty-five miles per hour.

1963
02:37:52.132 --> 02:37:53.382
Thirty.

1964
02:37:53.717 --> 02:37:55.926
Here we go. Here we go.

1965
02:37:56.094 --> 02:37:58.262
- Thirty-five.
- The air-speed indicator ...


1966
02:37:58.430 --> 02:38:02.058
... has moved up to 25. Thirty.

1967
02:38:02.476 --> 02:38:04.560
- Thirty-five.
- Forty.


1968
02:38:04.728 --> 02:38:06.562
As he pushes the throttle it's 40.

1969
02:38:06.730 --> 02:38:10.024
- Forty-five.
- Forty-five. More throttle.


1970
02:38:10.192 --> 02:38:12.193
- Forty-five.
- Fifty.


1971
02:38:12.778 --> 02:38:15.237
- It's 50 over a choppy sea.
- Fifty-five.


1972
02:38:15.405 --> 02:38:17.740
It's 55. It's 55.

1973
02:38:18.241 --> 02:38:20.409
- Sixty.
- More throttle. It's 60.


1974
02:38:20.577 --> 02:38:22.328
- Sixty-five.
- Sixty-five.


1975
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:28.918
- Seventy.
- It's 70.


1976
02:38:29.086 --> 02:38:31.837
- Seventy-five.
- It's 75.


1977
02:38:39.221 --> 02:38:44.517
And something momentarily cuts out.
I believe we are airborne.


1978
02:38:44.685 --> 02:38:48.270
We are airborne, ladies and gentlemen.
I don't believe that Hughes ...


1979
02:38:48.438 --> 02:38:51.190
... meant this to be. I don't know.

1980
02:38:53.402 --> 02:38:58.781
And we were really up in the air.
We were really up in the air.


1981
02:39:03.203 --> 02:39:06.622
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Hughes mammoth aircraft ...


1982
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:11.293
... has flown this afternoon
in Los Angeles Harbor.


1983
02:39:11.461 --> 02:39:15.673
Well, it certainly looks at this moment
that Howard Hughes will be around ...


1984
02:39:15.841 --> 02:39:19.719
... the United States for quite
some time to come.


1985
02:39:30.772 --> 02:39:34.817
We must understand that technologies
like these are the way of the future.


1986
02:39:34.985 --> 02:39:38.529
- That's enough questions.
- TWA and Hughes Aircraft are delighted ...


1987
02:39:38.697 --> 02:39:41.991
... to have you come here
and witness this wonderful sight.


1988
02:39:42.159 --> 02:39:44.326
- Excuse us for just a second.
- All right.


1989
02:39:44.494 --> 02:39:46.495
- So you feel like going to Paris?
- Now?


1990
02:39:46.663 --> 02:39:48.664
TWA is starting up flights to Europe.

1991
02:39:48.832 --> 02:39:52.293
I thought I might pilot the first one.
Ought to be some fun.


1992
02:39:52.461 --> 02:39:55.171
- Lots of shopping in Paris.
- I'll buy you anything.


1993
02:39:55.338 --> 02:39:58.257
You can buy me dinner. 
How about that?

1994
02:40:00.510 --> 02:40:02.928
Dinner, then. We got a date?

1995
02:40:03.138 --> 02:40:05.473
Okay, baby, you got a date.

1996
02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:10.895
I'll be back in a second,
but don't you go anywhere, now. I mean it.


1997
02:40:11.062 --> 02:40:14.064
All right, listen, boys.
Something new. Jet airplanes.


1998
02:40:14.232 --> 02:40:17.193
- You know about jets?
- No, but it sounds expensive.


1999
02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:19.779
Oh, it will be,
but we gotta get started.

2000
02:40:21.031 --> 02:40:23.824
Come on, walk with me.

2001
02:40:23.992 --> 02:40:26.327
Whoever can start utilizing
jet technology ...


2002
02:40:26.495 --> 02:40:30.372
... on commercial airliners is gonna win.
What do you know about the science?


2003
02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:35.002
I know a little. I can work something
to show you. Basic turbine stuff.


2004
02:40:39.633 --> 02:40:43.469
Noah, who are those fellas?

2005
02:40:44.387 --> 02:40:46.180
Do they work for me?

2006
02:40:47.516 --> 02:40:49.809
Everybody works for you, Howard.

2007
02:40:56.566 --> 02:41:01.278
Lockheed worked on the F-80. Let's get
Bob Gross and see if he can help us out.


2008
02:41:01.446 --> 02:41:03.739
- What, now?
- Of course now.


2009
02:41:03.907 --> 02:41:06.867
We gotta get into it.
Jets are the way of the future.


2010
02:41:07.035 --> 02:41:10.246
- It's 4:30.
- I talked to Bob last week. He's in New York.


2011
02:41:10.413 --> 02:41:13.040
- So it's 7:30.
- He won't be in the office.


2012
02:41:13.208 --> 02:41:16.418
We'll figure out what hotel he's at.
Do you want a call ...


2013
02:41:16.586 --> 02:41:20.089
... or you want some kind of meeting?
- We want a meeting, don't we?


2014
02:41:20.257 --> 02:41:23.509
Do you want me bring him
out here tomorrow, then, Howard?


2015
02:41:24.511 --> 02:41:26.929
- The way of the future.
- Howard?


2016
02:41:27.097 --> 02:41:28.848
- Howard?
- The way of the future.


2017
02:41:30.350 --> 02:41:33.102
- The way of the future.
- Let's take a walk, Howard.


2018
02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:35.187
- Way of the future.
- Give me a hand.


2019
02:41:35.355 --> 02:41:45.355
The way of the future.
The way of the future.


2020
02:41:52.122 --> 02:41:56.083
All right, stay here. I'll be right back.
You understand, Howard?


2021
02:41:56.251 --> 02:41:58.002
The way of the future.

2022
02:41:58.169 --> 02:42:01.797
Guard the door. I'll get a doctor.
No one sees him like this.


2023
02:42:01.965 --> 02:42:10.139
The way of the future.
The way of the future.


2024
02:42:14.269 --> 02:42:16.061
The way of the future.

2025
02:42:22.319 --> 02:42:24.361
You are not safe.

2026
02:42:32.871 --> 02:42:34.121
When I grow up ...

2027
02:42:34.664 --> 02:42:37.666
... I'm gonna fly the fastest planes
ever built ...


2028
02:42:37.834 --> 02:42:40.419
... make the biggest movies ever ...

2029
02:42:40.587 --> 02:42:43.505
... and be the
richest man in the world.

2030
02:42:56.770 --> 02:43:06.770
The way of the future.
