00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.210
片名：迈克尔·克莱顿

2
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.830
迈克尔
Michael.


3
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.930
亲爱的迈克尔，很显然是你，他们还能派谁过来？
Dear Michael. Of course it's you. Who else could they send?


4
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.430
还有谁值得信任？
Who else could be trusted?


5
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.330
我也知道你大老远地跑来很辛苦，而且你马上就要开始工作了
And I know it's a long way and you're ready to go to work.


6
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.790
但请听我说，等等、再等等、再… 让我把话说完
All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just­ Just please hear me out.


7
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.160
因为这不是什么小打小闹，也不是旧病复发，更不是什么胡搅蛮缠
Because this is not an episode, relapse, fuckup.


8
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.890
求你了，迈克尔，我求求你
I'm begging you, Michael, I'm begging you..


9
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.890
相信我吧，这不仅仅只是疯狂
Try and make believe this is not just madness­


10
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.090
…因为这绝不只是疯狂
­  because this is not just madness.


11
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.700
两周之前，我从这栋楼里出来，对吧？
Two weeks ago, I came out of the building, okay?


12
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.390
我跑过第六大街，有辆车等在那里…
I'm running across 6th Avenue, there's a car waiting­


13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.760
…我必须在38分钟内到达机场，我边走边说
­  I got exactly 38 minutes to get to the airport, and I'm dictating.


14
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.700
我那慌里慌张的助手也手忙脚乱地在记事本上…
There's this panicked associate sprinting along beside me­


15
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.390
…写个不停，突然她叫了起来
­  scribbling in a notepad, and she starts screaming.


16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.500
我猛地意识到我们正站在大街中央…
And I realize we're standing in the middle of the street­


17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.660
…信号一变，汹涌的车辆向我们冲过来
­  the light's changed and there's this wall of serious traffic speeding towards us.


18
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.860
我僵住了，无法动弹
And I freeze. I can't move.


19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.650
我突然被一种无法抵制的感觉所吞蚀
I'm suddenly consumed with the overwhelming sensation­


20
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.850
…我被些薄膜状的东西盖住了
­  that I'm covered with some sort of film.


21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.630
它粘在我的头发上和脸上，它有点像蛋清，又像是某种涂层
And it's in my hair, in my face. And it's like a glaze, like a coating.


22
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.560
起初我想，噢，上帝呀，我知道这是什么了
And at first I thought, "Oh, my God, I know what this is.


23
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.160
这是羊膜，是流动的羊水
This is some sort of amniotic, embryonic fluid.


24
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.030
我正处于产后那湿漉漉的时刻
I'm drenched in afterbirth.


25
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.860
我刚刚破茧而出，我重生了
I've breached the chrysalis. I've been reborn. "


26
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.330
但随后，汹涌的车流、涌动的人群、轿车、卡车、警笛的尖叫
But then, the traffic, the stampede, the cars, the trucks, the horns­


27
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.520
…还有这可怜女人的尖叫，我想，不，这不是重生
­  this poor woman screaming, and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.


28
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.570
这只是一些恢复过程中的奇妙幻觉
This is some kind of giddy illusion of renewal­


29
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.490
…只是大限将至之前的幻觉
­  that happens in the final moment before death. "


30
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.260
然后我意识到“不、不、不，这一切都错了”…
And then I realize, "No, no, no, this is completely wrong"­


31
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.400
因为我回头再看那栋大楼…
­  because I looked back at the building­


32
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.190
…我突然醒悟了
­  and I had the most stunning moment of clarity.


33
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.460
迈克尔，我… 我意识到…
I realized, Michael­


34
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.660
我出来了，但不是通过肯纳、巴赫和莱迪恩的大门…
­  that I had emerged, not through the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen­


35
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.130
不是我们那巨大无比的法律事务所的大门
­  not through the portals of our vast and powerful law firm­


36
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.090
而是通过一个有机体的屁眼…
­  but from the asshole of an organism­


37
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.900
这屁眼的唯一功能就是排出有毒物质…
­  whose sole function is to excrete the poison­


38
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.430
弹药和脱叶剂来给那些更大…
­  the ammo, the defoliant necessary for other larger­


39
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.160
…更强的公司用来摧毁人类文明的奇迹
­  more powerful organisms to destroy the miracle of humanity.


40
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.190
而在我生命中最美好的时刻…
And that I had been coated in this patina of shit­


41
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.560
…我也被涂上了一层这铜绿色的大便
­  for the best part of my life.


42
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.570
那东西的恶臭和污秽将使我的余生变得毫无意义
And the stench of it, the stain of it would take the rest of my life to undo.


43
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.000
你知道我做了些什么吗？
And you know what I did?


44
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.890
我深深地、彻底地吸了口气，把我那想法放到一边，我放下了它
I took a deep, cleansing breath and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.


45
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.470
我对自已说：很显然，这种强烈的感觉
I said to myself, "As clear as this may be, as potent a feeling as this is­


46
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.820
和我今天见证的东西一样真实，但它需要等待
­  as true a thing as I believe that I have witnessed today, it must wait.


47
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.460
它必须经受住时间的考验
It must stand the test of time. "


48
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.660
现在，迈克尔，时候到了
And, Michael, the time is now.


49
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.130
我想我能告诉的都已经告诉你了
I'm not sure what else I can tell you that I haven't already.


50
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.820
给我讲讲U/North公司的事，巴里，他们可是你们的客户
Tell me about U/North, Barry. They're your clients.


51
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.220
告诉我为什么你们大半夜的还在处理一件已经进行了6年的案子
So you tell me why you're settling a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.


52
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.090
因为不管你愿不愿意，我都在报道这件事
Because I'm writing this story whether you like it or not.


53
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.600
你到底想怎么样？
What does that exactly mean?


54
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.170
给我报点儿料
Give me something I can print.


55
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.930
我们找到了97个
We found 97.


56
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.630
那个《华尔街日报》的婊子打到了我的手机上
I've got that cunt from The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.


57
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.960
她不肯善罢甘休
She will not go away.


58
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.920
我是马蒂·巴赫，能帮上你什么忙吗？
Marty Bach. How can I help you?


59
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.190
马蒂，你好，我是布里奇特·克雷恩，我们打算明天刊登一篇…
Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein. We're going with a story tomorrow­


60
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.600
…有关U/North公司除草剂事件解决方案的报导，你对此有何评论？
­  about a settlement in the U/North defoliant case. You wanna comment?


61
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.130
你所说的这桩诉讼，到现在已经审理了6年…
Case you're referring to is now, as it has been for the past six years­


62
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.160
…一直悬而未决
­pending and unresolved.


63
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.930
在我们的客户上法庭…
Till such time as our client has their day in court­


64
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.580
…或者原告撤诉之前我都无可奉告
­or the plaintiffs drop the suit, I'll have nothing of value to tell you.


65
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.820
得了，马蒂，你是最了解这件案子的人，我知道你现在正在处理这件案子
Come on, Marty, you're closing the U/North case. You're settling.


66
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.460
我还知道你那里现在有600人在忙这个案子
I know that. I know you're up there with 600 people jamming this thing through.


67
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.060
我所知道的是，你的截稿时间已经过了20分钟
Here's what I know. Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.


68
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.720
不管你是在忙着把故事写完还是忙着联系撤稿
So you're fishing for a story or trying to get out of writing a retraction.


69
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.390
无论是哪一样，我都祝你好运
In either case, I wish you the best of luck.


70
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.520
凯伦·克劳德死哪儿去了？
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?


71
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.950
我跟
I'll see the turn.


72
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.490
不跟
Check.


73
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.260
不跟
Check.


74
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.000
不跟
Check.


75
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.160
半注，两百
Half the pot. Two hundred.


76
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.030
两百胜
Two hundred to go.


77
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.390
你不记得我了，哈？
You don't remember me, huh?


78
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.890
我们在一起玩过好几次
We played together a couple times.


79
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.160
在鲍威利区那个电灯屋
That lamp place on Bowery.


80
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.000
是那个家伙的商品陈列室吧？全是灯和其他乱七八糟的
That guy's showroom? All the lamps and shit?


81
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.560
-星河 -对，就是那儿
-The Galaxy -That's it.


82
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.930
你那时候还开了个餐馆，对吗？
You had a restaurant you were opening, right?


83
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.330
我过去的合伙人投标中了，负责管道
My old partner bid that job, the plumbing.


84
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.890
-你不记得我了？ -我记得你
-You don't remember me? -I remember you.


85
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.330
因为那之后我瘦了不少
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.


86
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.830
你也买了不少头发啊
You bought some hair too.


87
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.300
用的是你的钱
With your money.


88
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.560
那么，餐馆现在怎么样了？
So, what happened with the bar?


89
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.490
看来你经营的不善啊，哈？
You just had to be a rock star, huh?


90
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.830
操，哥们儿，还不如去听拉里·金(CNN主持人)呢，不玩了，回家看他妈的电视去
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King, I go home and put the fucking TV on.


91
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.460
那地点不错
That was a good location.


92
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.460
是呀，我的合伙人也是这么跟我说的
Yeah, that's what my partner kept telling me.


93
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.430
到你了
Action's on you.


94
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.830
我下底注
I bet the pot.


95
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.390
欢迎下次光临
Good to see you again.


96
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.160
喂？
Hello?


97
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.600
-是迈克尔吗？ -沃尔特吧
-Michael -Walter.


98
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.990
迈克尔，谢天谢地，总算找到你了，听着，我有点事情
Michael, thank God, there you are. Look, I got a situation.


99
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.260
出了个大事，明白么？我的一个客户他刚刚打电话给我，他开车撞了个人
A big problem, all right? A client of mine, he just called, he hit a guy with his car.


100
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.330
他觉得他撞了，他觉得他撞了个人
He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.


101
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.490
就刚才？
Just now?


102
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.320
是的，就刚才，10、15分钟前，在他开车回家的路上
Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago. He's driving home.


103
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.560
他现在在家，他在家里等你
He's home now. He's there waiting.


104
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.890
住哪儿？
Where?


105
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.900
西切斯特，我现在在百慕大这，我刚睡着就被他叫醒了
Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda. He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.


106
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.090
他有没有喝酒？
Is he drunk?


107
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.130
没有，我一开口也是这么问他的，他精神很好，很清醒
No. It's the first thing I asked him. He's good, he's sober.


108
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.790
告诉他不要接任何电话了
Tell him to stay off the phone.


109
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.230
好的，你会去吧？你能去那儿吗？
All right. But you're on it? You can get up there?


110
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.160
这个家伙可是一个大客户
Because this guy, he's a huge client.


111
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.890
我大部份业务都是和他做的，好么？
This is half my book, this guy, okay?


112
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.500
我正走向车子
I'm walking to the car now.


113
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.030
好的，那么这样，我给他回个电话把地址搞到
Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back and I'll get the address.


114
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.790
你只要在路上就行了，我会给你带来更多的细节
Just let me know you're on the way, and I'll get back to you with the details.


115
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.400
好吧，我马上开车去
All right. I'll be in the car.


116
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.700
看看他们都做了些什么吧，你看，他们把路给升级了
What they did, see, they changed the grade there.


117
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.660
他们加宽了街道
They widened the street.


118
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.730
我想肯定有人告诉他们这个改进不错
I'm sure somebody told them that that was an improvement.


119
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.390
但现在，你看，一到阴天下雨或者碰上大雾，在这些新的拐角处
But now, you see, when it rains and when there is fog, and with this new angle­


120
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.160
他们搞的这些新的… 这些… 这些…
­and they've got these new­ These­  These­


121
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.420
这些高压钠灯，晃死人了
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.


122
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.870
-就那个拐角，很刺眼 -他们会想办法解决的
-That corner there. It is blinding -They'll have to work that out.


123
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.860
不只是今晚，我都和他们说了好几年了
And it's not just tonight. I've been saying this for years.


124
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.660
我说，我们讨论过那个拐弯多少次了？戴尔？
I mean, how many times have we talked about that corner? Dell?


125
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.100
格林先生，我们没有多少时间
Mr.Greer, we don't have a lot of time here.


126
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.200
那么周边环境、路况，所有这些情况你都不感兴趣喽？
So the circumstances, the road conditions, none of this holds any interest for you?


127
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.270
我感兴趣的是找到一个能在15分钟内到达的
What interests me is finding the strongest criminal attorney­


128
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.030
…优秀刑事辩护律师
­that can be here in 15 minutes.


129
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.430
哇噢，听起来好像不妙呀
Well, that sounds ominous.


130
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.160
在西切斯特，我们有些很好的关系
We have some good relationships up here in Westchester.


131
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.270
那么，你是干什么的？干什么的？你不是律师？
So, what are you? What are you? You're not a lawyer?


132
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.220
-不是你要的那种 -那你是哪种？
-Not the kind you need -What kind is that?


133
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.380
执业庭审律师
A trial lawyer.


134
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.430
有人能办理好这事，但我处理不了
Somebody who can see this through. That's not what I do.


135
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.160
好吧，看来我还是只能把沃尔特找回来处理了
Okay. I think we're gonna have to pull Walter back in on this.


136
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.320
我会给沃尔特打电话，把他搅和进来
I wanna get Walter back on the phone, get him back into the mix.


137
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.230
因为，和你直说了吧，我不喜欢现在这样
Because, I'll be frank with you, I don't like the way this is going.


138
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.060
先生，我们没时间等沃尔特了，你的选择范围正在快速地减小
Sir, we don't have time for Walter. Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.


139
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.290
什么选择范围？一个选项我都没听到！
What options? I'm not hearing any options!


140
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.690
我建议你还是到本地警局自首…
I suggest you go local­


141
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.730
…然后会有人来处理好这件事的
­and I'm telling you there are people here I like for this.


142
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.960
好极了，就那样吗？你就是这样帮我解决问题的吗？
Great. That's it? That's what you got for me?


143
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.150
嘿，你相信吗？
Hey, you believe this?


144
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.630
12年来，我一直都是你们肯纳、巴赫事务所的客户
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach for 12 years!


145
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.530
你认为我每月给你们付钱就是为了有朝一日能出庭受审？
You think I paid that retainer every month for a place at the back of the line?


146
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.000
格林先生，你在周日晚上离开一起事故的现场…
Mr.Greer, you left the scene of an accident on a slow weeknight­


147
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.360
…离州警局只有6英里远
­six miles from the state police barracks.


148
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.760
如果真要受审的话，你也快了
If there's a line, you're right up front.


149
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.800
我随时都可以再找个律师，我不需要你了
I can get a lawyer any time I want. I don't need you for that.


150
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.860
我们在这儿傻坐了45分钟就等来了这么一个白痴建议！
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes waiting for a goddamn referral!


151
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.790
我不知道沃尔特给了你什么承诺…
I don't know what Walter promised you­


152
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.420
一位天才员工！沃尔特在电话里是这么说的，就在20分钟前
A miracle worker! That's Walter on the phone, 20 minutes ago.


153
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.690
原话要听么，啊？“挺住，我会派一个天才来帮助你”
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight. I'm sending you a miracle worker."


154
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.490
-喔，那他说错了 -哪儿说错了？
-Well, he misspoke -About what?


155
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.260
关于你是公司的救火员那部份？还是你根本就不在行？
That you're the firm's fixer? Or that you're good at it?


156
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.900
埃里奥特
Elliot.


157
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.350
那个家伙突然跑出来！在大马路上！
The guy was running! In the street!


158
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.260
你设想一下，大雾、路灯、还有那些转弯…
You take that, you add the fog, you add the lamps, you add the angle­


159
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.250
那个家伙大半夜的在街上跑个什么劲儿啊？！
What the fuck is he doing running in the middle of the street at midnight?!


160
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.620
你倒是说呀！
You answer me that!


161
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.330
说车被人偷了怎么样？
What if someone had stolen the car?


162
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.660
这种事常有的
Happens all the time.


163
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.920
警察们最喜欢处理这种交通肇事逃逸
Cops like hit-and-runs.


164
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.120
他们会快速利落地去办
They work them hard, they clear them fast.


165
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.490
现在犯罪现场调查部门正在从防撞护栏取走油漆样本
Right now there's a B.C.I. Unit pulling paint chips off a guard rail.


166
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.990
明天，他们就会开始寻找谁拥有涂有这种定制颜料的
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking for the owner of a custom-painted­


167
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.400
…那辆手排档美洲虎XJ-12
­hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.


168
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.160
还有你撞到的那个家伙？
And the guy you hit?


169
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.690
如果他看到了车牌的话，就更快了
If he got a look at the plates, it won't even take that long.


170
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.630
这样就玩完了
There's no play here.


171
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.770
再没有什么拐弯，也没有放香槟的房间
There's no angle. There's no champagne room.


172
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.590
我也不是什么天才，我就是个看门的
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.


173
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.820
道理很简单
The math on this is simple.


174
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.990
麻烦越少，我处理起来就越容易
The smaller the mess, the easier it is for me to clean up.


175
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:52.260
警察打来的，是吗？
That's the police, isn't it?


176
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.830
不是
No.


177
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.330
他们是不会打的
They don't call.


178
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.430
喂
Hello.


179
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.800
杰瑞，我是迈克尔·克莱顿
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.


180
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.440
对，是的，不好意思吵醒你了
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.


181
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.490
不，我在你的隔壁
No. I'm in the neighborhood.


182
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.730
你有笔吗？
You got a pen?


183
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.690
(四天前)

184
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.090
妈妈，我的牌在哪儿？
Mom, where's my cards?


185
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.960
我的牌在哪儿呢？
Where's my cards?


186
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.490
我的另一幅牌在这儿不？
Is my other deck in here?


187
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.060
你吃了吗？
Did you eat?


188
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.130
爸爸已经在下面等着了
Dad's down there waiting already.


189
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.160
洗手间里有几副牌
There were cards in our bathroom.


190
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.600
吃了，我吃的瓦夫饼
Yes, I had a waffle.


191
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.630
那怎么可能，家里的瓦夫饼早就吃完了
Since we're out of waffles, I don't see how that's possible.


192
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.130
那是个奇迹
It's a miracle.


193
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.430
带了手套没？
Gloves?


194
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.220
亨利！
Henry!


195
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.390
快点
Come on.


196
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.730
上车
Get in.


197
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.320
坐好了？
Got it?


198
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.730
因此实际上没人能确定他们身处何地…
So no one's even sure exactly where they are­


199
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.060
…因为那里没有边界没有地标或其它什么标记
­because there's no borders or landmarks or anything.


200
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.960
至于城镇么？那根本算不上什么城镇
And the town? It's not even a town really.


201
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.330
那只不过是个大家聚在一起藏起来的小营地
It just is this camp where all these people have gathered to hide.


202
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.490
好
Right.


203
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.120
所有这些逃兵和被军队赶出来的人
All these deserters and guys that got cut off from their armies.


204
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.460
所有这些人都躲在森林里，努力活下去
All these people that are hiding in the woods, trying to stay alive.


205
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.530
这就是他们归宿
This is where they all came.


206
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.680
那里有盗贼、黑魔导士、佣兵…
There's Thieves, Gray Mages, Unbidden Warriors­


207
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.890
…暗禽、河童、还有穴居魔
­Dark Avians, Riverwynders and Sappers.


208
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.230
-像这样的角色一共有15种，明白么？ -明白
-There's, like, 15 different characters, okay? -Okay.


209
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.430
谁都没有盟友
And nobody has any alliances.


210
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.860
你甚至不能告诉别人你是谁，因为你不知道…
You can't even say who you are because, you don't know­


211
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.020
现在和你说话的这个人…
­maybe the person you're talking to­


212
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.690
会不会就是你战场上的宿敌
­maybe they're like your mortal enemy in the wars.


213
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.550
所以那里的每个人都只能自顾自
So it's just completely like everybody for themselves.


214
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.060
听起来好耳熟啊
Sounds familiar.


215
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.160
真的很棒，真的，你该读读
It's really good. I'm serious, you should really read it.


216
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.500
好的，不过我看完了以后估计你就会迷上了什么别的玩意儿
Right. But by the time I finish it, you'll be on to something else.


217
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.420
-你敢和我打赌吗？ -不知道，你想赌多少？
-How much you wanna bet? -I don't know. How much you got?


218
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.430
-乘车卡带了么？ -放储物柜里了
-You got your bus pass? -It's in my locker.


219
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.470
你根本就不打算看它，对吗？
You're not even gonna look at it, are you?


220
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.070
-那本书吗？ -是的
-The book? -Yes.


221
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.630
星期六把它带来，我会…
Bring it on Saturday, I'll­


222
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.030
我早就带了，放在你厨房里了，红色封面的
I did already. I left it in your kitchen. It's got a red cover.


223
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.320
好吧
Okay.


224
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.900
好吧，到了
Well, here we go.


225
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.750
去吧，好好教教那些人，知道么？
Go. Teach these people something, would you?


226
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.390
-回见，爸爸 -好的，孩子
-See you later, Dad -Yeah, kiddo.


227
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.930
谢谢
Thanks.


228
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.720
第52号拍品，各种各样的搅拌碗，什么型号都有
Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls, assorted sizes.


229
00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.860
30美元起，30美元，有人出30美元了
Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars. Thirty dollars I have.


230
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.120
你可以出价40，40了，50，后面有人出60了
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50. Sixty dollars back there.


231
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.530
现在60，有人出70吗？70了
Sixty dollars, get me to 70. I got 70 dollars.


232
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.220
70美元，现在70了，那里有人出80
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70. Eighty dollars there.


233
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.800
80，这位先生出80，80美元
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here. Eighty dollars.


234
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.700
90美元了，还有人出100吗？100了
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100. One hundred I have now.


235
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.590
他跟我说你还差点儿
He says you're still gonna be short.


236
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.490
差多少？
How short?


237
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:17.070
6万块，加上扣点，7万5
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.


238
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.290
-那就是酒和其他东西的价钱？ -你觉得该是多少？
-That's liquor and everything? -What'd you think it was gonna be?


239
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.450
我不知道，可能更少，三两万吧
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.


240
00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.500
他用了1500块买就买走了我那四千块的冰箱
He took 1500 on a refrigerator I paid four grand for.


241
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.290
你开个价
Make a bid.


242
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.520
你不会告诉我说你连7万5都没有吧？
Are you telling me you don't have the 75 thousand?


243
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.760
说真的，没有
Just lying around, no.


244
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.350
我们都知道这事实际上我该找你弟弟谈
We both know it's your brother I should be talking to.


245
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.550
算了吧
Forget that.


246
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.030
迈克尔，你看，你要帮他收拾残局，这是你自己选的
Michael, look, you wanna front this, that's up to you.


247
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.420
但是债务还清之前，提米依然是欠款人
But Timmy's name stays in the book till we're clear.


248
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.200
如果我知道他在哪儿，我就没必要这么一直问下去了
If I know where he is, I don't have to keep asking.


249
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.060
他呆在远郊，他老婆把他领回来了，但我不知道他在哪儿
He's upstate. His wife took him back. I don't know where he is.


250
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.020
他肯定还有点儿值钱的
He's gotta have something.


251
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.690
他就剩老婆和两个孩子了
He's got the two kids with her.


252
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.530
他还有珍妮弗，那被他把肚子搞大的可乐促销员
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress that he knocked up.


253
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:10.360
他还有4个从我妹妹车库里偷走的米其林轮胎
He's got four Michelin radials that he stole from my sister's garage.


254
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.430
你出个价吧
Make an offer.


255
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:20.230
我曾有个酒鬼老婆，她既年轻又漂亮
I had a wife who was a drunk. She was a beautiful girl, young girl.


256
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.960
但就那样生活？后来有个戒酒计划，她参加了，戒了… 2年
But live like that? Even they do a program­ She did, I think, once, two years.


257
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.130
后来计划没有了呢？别提了
And then they slip? Forget it.


258
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.660
就像你身上捆着个炸弹
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.


259
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.820
我还有多少时间？
What's my timeframe here?


260
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.160
我不知道
I don't know.


261
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.330
我想那不是个问题
I didn't think it'd be a problem.


262
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.450
我会问问的
I'll ask.


263
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.160
-早啊，迈克尔 -早，卡尔
-Hey, Michael -Morning, Carl.


264
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.040
(肯纳、巴赫和莱迪恩律师事务所)

265
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.660
我不知道，戴尔，我不知道你想让我施压到什么程度
I don't know. Del, I don't know how hard you want me to press here.


266
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.820
让我知道他有多大能耐
Let me know how brave he wants to be.


267
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.330
好吧，我现在还不知道他能有多能耐
Well, I'm not sure how brave he can be right now.


268
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.820
我们只是刚刚确认了听证会的时间表
We just got a confirmation hearing scheduled.


269
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.390
她有可能知道吗？
Any chance she knows that?


270
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.190
喔，都上报了，谁知道呢？可能有人读给她听吧
Well, it was in the paper. Who knows? Maybe she got someone to read it to her.


271
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.890
她昨天给他老婆打电话了，打到他家里
She called his wife yesterday. She's calling his house.


272
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.290
这可糟透了
This is a total nightmare.


273
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.590
是的，我猜她无非是想要那套房子
Well, my guess is she's gonna want the condo.


274
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.820
不是吧，那也太疯狂了
Come on, that's insane.


275
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.520
好吧，我还能和你说什么呢？别和算计好了的婊子斗
Well, what can I tell you? Don't piss off a motivated stripper.


276
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:46.900
简直难以置信
It's just unbelievable.


277
00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.320
嗯，这样吧，了解他的底限，然后告诉我
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold and get back to me.


278
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.400
或者你要他直接打电话给我
Or you can tell him to call me directly.


279
00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.560
好的，听你的，我来搞定
All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.


280
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.890
好的，就这样，谢谢
Thanks.


281
00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.700
嘿，马蒂现在在哪儿？
Hey, where are we with Marty?


282
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.180
我们给他留言了
We left word.


283
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.520
等一下，再说一次，孩子有多大了？
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?


284
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.690
他不是“孩子”了，都22了
He's not a kid. He's 22.


285
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.530
-是在迈阿密吗？ -不是，比斯坎湾
-This is Miami? -Nope. Key Biscayne.


286
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.180
他们指控他…
And they charged him.


287
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.660
说他过失伤人，我的委托人…
Reckless endangerment. My client­


288
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:17.270
我想他们实际上是想要… 想要调查那名律师
I think really what they want, they want a reality check on the attorney down there.


289
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.490
-好吧 -韦恩说你有些门路？
-Yeah -Wayne said you have some connections?


290
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.190
-好的，让我拿支笔 -谢谢
-Yeah, let me get a pen -Thank you.


291
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.990
现在，如果她直接给移民局打电话，那她就哪儿也去不了了
Now, if she calls the INS directly, she's gonna get nowhere.


292
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.400
预约都不行么？
Even with the appointment?


293
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.050
移民局是这么说的，埃文，就像被交通管制了一样
It's retail, Evan. It's like the DMV over there.


294
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.560
除非能得到地区主管的同意，否则没人能离开
Unless they get a call from a district supervisor, then nobody moves.


295
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.290
但你的人不是可以吗？
But your guy can do that?


296
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.800
他已经离任了
He's a former commissioner.


297
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.890
那么现在没人能帮我了？因为干什么都没用了
None of this comes back to me? Because that doesn't do any good.


298
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.160
不，不是，我就是你唯一能够咨询的人
No, look, I'm gonna be the one that's asking.


299
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.660
-你能等两分钟吗？ -当然可以
-Can you hang on a minute? -Yeah, sure.


300
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.770
我们要正在进行合并吗？
Are we merging?


301
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.420
马蒂·巴赫在伦敦
Marty Bach's in London.


302
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.690
起初是说他在亚特兰大，然后娜拉说他就在这栋楼里
They said he was in Atlanta, then Lara said he was in the building.


303
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.990
所以我就给他打了过去，我知道你想和他见面
So I called back. I know you want this meeting.


304
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.720
现在，她告诉我实情了，他确实在伦敦
Now she tells me the truth. He's really in London.


305
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.090
那我们的确是在进行合并了？我是说，大家都在这么说
So are we merging? I mean, that's what everyone's saying.


306
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.390
那些英国佬？这次是来真的了
All these Brits? That this time it's for real.


307
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.360
好像我知道似的
Like I would know.


308
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.220
我不知道
I don't know.


309
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.060
但就算是真的，我是说，就算是合并了，对我们也没多大的影响，对吧？
But even if we are, I mean, even if they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?


310
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.490
有电话里来了
Your phone's ringing.


311
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.830
埃文？
Evan?


312
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.360
嘿，好的，我打算这么办
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.


313
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.500
我给他打个电话下周安排一次会面
Let me give him a call and set up a meeting for next week.


314
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.070
我会把她带来，介绍一下…
I'll walk her in, I'll make the introduction­


315
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.790
目前，U/North公司拥有7万名员工…
At the moment, U/North currently has 70,000 employees­


316
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.990
…分布在全世界62个国家
­  in 62 countries around the world.


317
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.190
覆盖全球
Around the planet.


318
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.060
运作在62个国家，覆盖全球
Operating in 62 countries around the planet.


319
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.900
在世界范围内进驻到60多个国家
At work in more than 60 countries around the globe.


320
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.730
我们拥有… 我们现在拥有… 我们拥有…
We have­  We have, right now­ We have­


321
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.130
U/North公司目前拥有7万5千名员工
At U/North right now, we've got 75,000 employees­


322
00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.060
分布在全球60余个国家
­in over 60 countries around the planet.


323
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.990
我们是一个非常成功的多元化的公司
We are a very successful and highly diversified company­


324
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.890
因此你可以想像…
­so you can imagine­


325
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.500
…我们每天要面对大量不同种类的法律问题
­the volume and the variety of legal issues we have to deal with is­


326
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.130
数量巨大的
Overwhelming.


327
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.530
实在是太多了
It's just enormous.


328
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.330
因此你可以想像法律问题的…
So you can imagine, the volume of legal issues­


329
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.890
数量是十分巨大的
It's quite substantial.


330
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.660
作为法律总顾问，我所要做的…
And as general counsel, what I do­


331
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.030
我们内部部门要做的…
­what our in-house department does­


332
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.460
…就是分析问题的大小或者看准时机
­is to analyze the dimension of the problem or the opportunity­


333
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.960
来提出仲裁…
­to determine the jurisdiction­


334
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.360
把我们的业务外包给…
­and to outsource our business­


335
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.980
…那些我们认为对公司最有帮助的企业和个人
­to those firms and talents that we think can help us the most.


336
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.020
那么面对这么大的压力和工作量…
So with all that pressure and workload­


337
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.530
…你是如何在工作和生活之间平衡的呢？
­  how do you keep a balance between work and life?


338
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.170
平衡？
Balance?


339
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.990
我想… 有些东西…
I think that's­  That's something that­


340
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.500
…你会耗尽毕生精力去探寻的，对吗？
­you search for your whole life, isn't it?


341
00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.460
实际上，那是一种变换着的平衡
It's a shifting balance, really.


342
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.790
这是，你知道，你… 你试着去…
It's, you know, you­  You try to­


343
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.260
当你真的喜欢你的事业时…
When you really are enjoying what it is you do­


344
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.290
…谁还会在乎什么平衡呢？
­who needs balance?


345
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.890
这就是你的平衡，这就是你的平衡
There's your balance. There's your balance.


346
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.020
当你真的喜欢你的事业时，那就是你的平衡所在
When you're really enjoying what it is you do, there is your balance.


347
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.350
当丹要我担任…
When Don asked me to take­


348
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.000
当丹·杰弗瑞带上… 丹·杰弗瑞带我…
When Don Jeffries brought­ Don Jeffries brought me­


349
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.130
12年前丹·杰瑞弗把我带到这儿来…
Don Jeffries brought me in here 12 years ago­


350
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.390
…给予我信任，悉心指导我
­trusted me, mentored me.


351
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.530
欢迎我加入U/North这个大家庭
Welcomed me into the U/North family.


352
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.030
当他升到董事会后，我做梦都没…
And when he moved up to the boardroom, I never really­


353
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.350
…没想过我会有机会坐到他的位置上
­dreamt that I would have the opportunity to move into his position.


354
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.290
但，这是不是很有挑战性？当然
But, is it challenging? Yes.


355
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:48.120
我想在最初的几个月里的确有点磕磕绊绊
And I think that it's possible that those first few months were a little shaky.


356
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:53.390
但当你意识到你所学的让你有备而来，你就会把握住方向
But then you realize that you've been taught to be ready, and you take the helm.


357
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.560
因为如果你没有准备好承担相应的责任…
Because if you're not comfortable with that level of responsibility­


358
00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.560
…那你就不适合坐这个位置
­you're in the wrong place.


359
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.830
这是你的部门，你有能力在关键时刻做出决定…
It's your department, your capacity to make tough decisions in real time, and­


360
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.430
我们正在录节目
We're in the middle of an interview.


361
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.560
他们说这是紧急情况
They said it was urgent.


362
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.030
老天
Jesus.


363
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.530
上帝啊
For chrissake.


364
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.960
你是说他这么做了，在…？
You're saying he did this in­?


365
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.190
噢，天啊
Oh, my God.


366
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.020
-巴里 -等一下
-Barry -Hang on.


367
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.650
亚瑟·伊顿刚刚在密尔沃基的证人室里脱了个精光
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked in a deposition room in Milwaukee.


368
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.990
哦，迈克尔…
Oh, Michael­


369
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.830
…我深深地、彻底地吸了口气，把我那想法放到一边，我放下了它
­  I took a deep, cleansing breath and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.


370
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.790
我对自已说：很显然，这种强烈的感觉…
I said to myself, "As clear as this may be, as potent a feeling as this is­


371
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.730
…和我今天见证的东西一样真实，但它需要等待
­  as true a thing as I believe that I have witnessed today, it must wait.


372
00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.890
它必须经受住时间的考验
It must stand the test of time. "


373
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.820
现在，迈克尔，时候到了
And, Michael, the time is now.


374
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.450
就此时、今天、这里、这房子、这空气…
This moment, today, here, this room, this air­


375
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:59.030
…还有这点，特别是这点，迈克尔，你也来了
­  and this, especially this, Michael, that you're here.


376
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.990
这就是原因
There's a reason.


377
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.860
你就是一个原因，迈克尔
A reason it's you, Michael.


378
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:07.530
当然，你会对它有些感觉，它是如何拼凑，又是如何聚集的
Surely, you have some sense of that, how it pulls together, how it gathers.


379
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:11.420
看门人迈克尔，幕后英雄，隐藏罪恶的守护者
Nurse Michael, the secret hero, the keeper of the hidden sins.


380
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.860
看在上帝份上，迈克尔，告诉我这你都明白
Tell me you can see that, Michael, for God's sake.


381
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:19.160
但是，我要说，是的… 裸体，在停车场，我承认
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes. The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.


382
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.030
那是… 那是… 是个错误，那很无聊、很软弱
It was­  It was­  It was a mistake. It was wrong. It was lame.


383
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.290
很明显的，那些药剂根本就不起作用…
It was obvious. And therapeutically, it was completely useless­


384
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.830
但我发誓，我会在这里不要这老脸…
­because I swear, I could stand here and tear off my fucking skin­


385
00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:34.730
…就是因为不能忍受那些鬼东西存在
­and I could not get down to where this thing is living.


386
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.620
6年了，迈克尔，6年来我一直在吸收这些毒素
Six years, Michael. Six years I've absorbed this poison.


387
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.060
400多人作证，100多人提出动议，5次改变审判地点…
Four hundred depositions, a hundred motions, five changes of venue­


388
00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.670
…8万5千份卷宗
­85,000 documents in discovery.


389
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.020
6年来不停地谋划、拖延与惊恐，我又得到了什么？
Six years of scheming and stalling and screaming, and what have I got?


390
00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.650
耗费了我12%生命来维护这该死的除草剂公司的声誉！
I've spent 12 percent of my life defending the reputation of a deadly weed killer!


391
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.930
-我们说好了的，亚瑟 -有天晚上
-We had an agreement, Arthur -One night.


392
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.030
有天晚上，知道吧？我发现马蒂在我的办公室里
One night, right? I look up and there's Marty in my office.


393
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.530
拿着香槟酒
He's got some champagne.


394
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:05.460
他说我们已经为U/North提供了3万小时的收费服务，他想庆祝一下
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours on U/North and he wants to celebrate.


395
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.150
一小时后，我发现自己在切尔西区的一家妓院里…
So an hour later, I find myself in a whorehouse in Chelsea­


396
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.730
…两个红发的立陶宛女人在我下身轮流给我吹喇叭
­with two Lithuanian redheads taking turns sucking my dick.


397
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.990
我躺在那里，想多爽一会儿，我想…
I'm laying there and I'm trying not to come and I wanna­


398
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.460
我想多“挺”一会儿，所以我就开始计算别的
I wanna make it last, so I start doing the math.


399
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.860
我想3万小时，那是多久呀，24乘以30
I think, "Thirty thousand hours, what is that? That's 24 times 30.


400
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:28.120
一个月是720小时，一年是8760小时…
That's 720 hours in a month, 8760 hours in a year­"


401
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.850
-亚瑟 -不，等等，等等，听我说！
-Arthur -No, wait, wait, wait!


402
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.360
那是多少年呀！那可是多少条命啊！
Because it's years! It's lives!


403
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.370
这些数字让我发晕，你知道…
And the numbers are making me dizzy and, you know­


404
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:40.720
…现在，我不再考虑怎么多“挺”一会儿了，我开始试着不要再思考下去，但我停不下来
­now, instead of trying not to come, I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.


405
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.300
我想，这是我吗？
I mean, is this me?


406
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.800
我是个被送到这里来吃喝玩乐…
Am I this freak organism that has been sent here to sleep and eat­


407
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.160
…然后为那个让人毛骨悚然的致癌链式分子做辩护的大傻瓜么？
­and defend this one horrific chain of carcinogenic molecules?


408
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.320
难道这就是我的命运？我的定数？
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?


409
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:55.730
-听着，你答应过我 -是吗，迈克尔？
-Listen, you promised me -Is that it, Michael?


410
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.860
这就是我长期努力的目标？两个立陶宛娘们儿给我吹喇叭？
Is that my grail? Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?


411
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.590
这就是我的多项选择的正确答案吗？
Is that the correct answer to the multiple choice of me?


412
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.960
你想不吃药，也可以，但你得先给我打电话
You wanna go off your medication, that's fine. But you call me first.


413
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.800
-那是我们约好的 -告我去啊
-That was our agreement -Sue me.


414
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.150
你们俩没事吧？
We okay in there?


415
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.860
我们俩没事，没事
We're fine. We're fine.


416
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.530
除草剂杀死了他们，迈克尔
They killed them, Michael.


417
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.890
那些小农庄，家族农场
Those small farms, the family farms.


418
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.590
你有… 你有… 你有见过安娜吗？
Did you­? Did you­? Did you meet Anna?


419
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.790
没有
No.


420
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.050
你得去看看她，你得去找她谈谈，她很了不起，迈克尔
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her. She's a miracle, Michael.


421
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.220
她可是造物主创造的最完美的小精灵
She's God's perfect little creature.


422
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.830
为了那5千万美元的费用，我花去了12%的生命…
And for 50 million dollars in fees, I've spent 12 percent of my life­


423
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.630
…毁掉了完美的安娜，还有她那已故的父母和奄奄一息的哥哥
­destroying perfect Anna and her dead parents and her dying brother.


424
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.560
你最后一次吃这些是什么时候？
When did you last take one of these?


425
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.460
不，这玩意儿我还有，这一切都是有原因的
No. I'm not losing this. Everything is finally significant.


426
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.070
这是个美好的世界，我什么都不想换了
The world is a beautiful place. I'm not trading that.


427
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.490
-即使一切都是真的，这药也不会害了你 -我手上沾满了鲜血
-If it's real, the pill won't kill it -I have blood on my hands.


428

你是全球最大、最知名律师事务所的
You are senior litigating partner of one of the largest­

430
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.700
-我只是个帮凶！ -你只不过是有躁狂抑郁症
-I'm an accomplice! -You're a manic-depressive.


431
00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.160
我是湿婆(印度教的主神之一，世界的毁灭者和重建者，死亡之神)
I am Shiva, the god of death.


432
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.550
让我们离开密尔沃基吧，以后再说这个
Let's get out of Milwaukee, we'll talk about it.


433
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.690
我们从医院回来之后，大家都哭了…
We came back from the hospital and everybody was crying­


434
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.890
…我们当时很惊讶，但我们还得… 我们不得不去挤奶
­  and we were in shock, but we still­ We had to milk.


435
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.500
奶牛可不会等你，是吧？
The cows won't wait, will they?


436
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.660
不会
No.


437
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.850
当你们来到牛棚时？
And when you went to the barn?


438
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.620
我们发现了一个便条，我妹妹找到的

你能给我们读一下么？
Could you read it for us, please?

就读第三段吧，就读那些标记过的地方

对不起，我反对
Excuse me, I have an objection.

快把摄像机关了！

我到底关不关？
How do I turn it off?

这就是我的供词，我的衣服就是供词，这就是我的耻辱
This is my offering. My clothes are my offering. This is my shame.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.520
他从刑事诉讼转型到遗产法和信托法？
He goes from criminal prosecution to wills and trusts?


487
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.060
他在那里干了17年了，还不是合伙人？
He's been there 17 years, he's not a partner?


488
00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.890
这就是他们派来的人？这家伙到底是谁？
This is the guy they send? Who is this guy?


489
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.390
-你好 -把门关好
-Hi -Close the door.


490
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.860
好，你们当中没有人知道他来了吧？
All right. So nobody, none of you, had any idea he was coming?


491
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.290
去密尔沃基？去听证会？
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?


492
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.020
我们以为已经解决了，有一些传言，所以我们觉得事情已经妥了
We thought there was a settlement. There's been some rumors.


493
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:37.780
是这样，这事非常简单，亚瑟没有按量服药
Okay. Look, it's very simple. Arthur has a chemical imbalance.


494
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.830
他应该坚持吃药，但他没有
He's supposed to be taking his medication. He's fallen behind on that.


495
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.490
现在他正在好转中，三四天后他就会好的
He's on the mend. He'll be fine in three or four days.


496
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.820
现在，我给你们说清楚，这屋子里发生的一切都不要透露出去
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear. What happened here stays in this room.


497
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.960
一点一滴信息都不能泄露
This is not a piece of information you wanna be out in front of.


498
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.430
还有人有问题吗，有就马上说
Anybody has a problem with that, I need to know right now.


499
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.920
很好
All right.


500
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.630
我们今晚就得在这儿过了
We're stuck here overnight.


501
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.090
如果可能的话我明天就送他回家
I'm gonna take him home tomorrow if I can.


502
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.230
谁负责听证会的时间表？
Who's in charge of the deposition schedule?


503
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.060
-我 -我们现在进行到什么程度了？
-I am -Where do we stand with that?


504
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.420
我想我们可能停住了，我们不知道下一步该做些什么
I guess it's on hold. We didn't know what to do.


505
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.650
没有停下来的事，你继续做你们该做的
Nothing is on hold. Keep doing what you were.


506
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.090
对方想谈些什么的话，他们可以纽约打电话
Other side wants to talk, they can call New York.


507
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.320
-我要他的公文包 -亚瑟的？不知道… 没看见
-I need his briefcase -Arthur's? I don't­  I didn't see it.


508
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:20.590
-他说就在房间里 -可能朱迪拿走了吧
-He said it was in the room -It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.


509
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:22.560
找到它
Find it.


510
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.830
所有这些人，都开始有这些梦了，对吧？
So all these people, they all start having these dreams, okay?


511
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.400
你知道什么叫“幻象探索”么？嗯，就像那些纳瓦霍人(美洲印第安人的一支)那样
You know what a vision quest is? You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?


512
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.820
嗯，我知道，就像…
Yeah. I think so. Like a­


513
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.060
就像一个特别的梦
Like a special dream.


514
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:47.780
不同之处就在于所有人都做一样的梦
Except this is like a whole bunch of people having the same dream.


515
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.360
这个梦让他们大家都到同一个地方
They're all having this dream that they should go to this one place.


516
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.560
他们不知道为什么要这样做
They don't know why or anything.


517
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.860
但他们就是有种非去那里不可的感觉
They just have this feeling that they have to go there.


518
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.890
他们是召唤的一群人
That they've been summoned.


519
00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:00.290
那就是其中的一章
That's the chapter.


520
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:03.430
真的，就叫做“召唤与征服”
Seriously, that's what it's called: "Summons to Conquest."


521
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.900
这是标题
That's the title.


522
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:10.720
嗯，但他们知道么？他们知道他们的梦都一样吗？
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know they're all having the same dream?


523
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.860
不知道，这就是精彩的地方
No. That's what's so cool.


524
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.330
他们都觉得只有自己才有
They all think it's just them.


525
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:19.550
也许他们可能已经疯了，但他们就是不想承认
That maybe they're, like, going crazy or something, so they don't wanna admit it.


526
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.860
是呀，但其实他们没有发疯，对吗？
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?


527
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.520
不，一切都是真的，他们没有疯
No. It's real. It's really happening.


528
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:29.320
是的，都是真的，不是么？
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?


529
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:35.190
有东西比他们更为强大，而他们还没有准备好…
Something larger than themselves and they're not ready, are they­


530
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.160
…他们会察觉到么？
­to hear it?


531
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.230
是的，不久之后他们就会
Yeah. But later they will.


532
00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.230
如果你想看这本书的话，我就不再透露情节了
So if you're gonna read it, I don't wanna spoil it.


533
00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.660
你在干什么，和谁说话呢？
What are you doing? Who you talking to?


534
00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.790
我给我爸爸打电话，他的一个朋友接的
I called my dad. It's a friend of his.


535
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.230
-谁？ -伊顿先生，你不认识他
-Who? -Mr.Edens. You don't know him.


536
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.060
-喂，喂 -亨利，已经11点多了
-Hello? Hello? -Henry, it's after 11.


537
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.030
我得马上挂了
I gotta get off now.


538
00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:00.180
不，等下，那本书，我想看看，书名是什么
No. Wait, wait. The book. I need the book. The title.


539
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.030
书名是《王国与征服》
The book is Realm and Conquest.


540
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.960
《王国与征服》
Realm and Conquest.


541
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.180
-单行本，红色封面的 -亨利，把电话给我
-It's Book One, with the red cover -Henry, give me the phone.


542
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.920
我得挂了，告诉我爸我给他打电话了，好吗？
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?


543
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.200
好，好的，谢… 谢，谢谢你，亨利，谢谢你
Yeah. Yeah. Thank­  Thank­  Thank­ Thank you, Henry, thank you.


544
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.830
《王国与征服》，谢谢
Realm and Conquest. Thank you.


545
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.050
凯伦？你好，我是迈克尔·克莱顿
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.


546
00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.700
-你迟到了 -我知道
-You're late -I know.


547
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.390
对不起，这事比我们预想的要复杂
I'm sorry, it was more complicated than we thought.


548
00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.260
他在哪儿？五点半我们就在这儿了
Where is he? We've been here since 5:30.


549
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.590
-他睡了 -那么，把他叫起来
-He's asleep -Well, wake him up.


550
00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.020
那可不行，我们刚让他安静下来
That's not gonna happen. We just got him sedated.


551
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.560
只要他接受日常的药物治疗…
Once he gets back on his regular medication­


552
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.670
…不多时间他就能回来
­then it's just a matter of time.


553
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.590
-你有看那段录像么？那盘带子？ -我听说了
-Have you seen the video? The tape? -I heard about it.


554
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.330
那之后发生的事情更糟
What happened after is worse.


555
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:15.400
那可是停车场，人们停车开车的地方
This is in the parking lot, okay? People running for their cars.


556
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.680
他在那里就穿了双袜子，别的没了
He's there in his socks, nothing else.


557
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.520
对不起，很抱歉，我再也不想和这疾病为伍了
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I will not sit with this sickness any longer.


558
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.500
我再也不能助长这疾病了
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."


559
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.260
这话什么意思？
What does this mean?


560
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.220
我也不清楚
I'm not sure.


561
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.020
你整晚和他在一起，他说了些什么？
You've been with him the whole evening. What's he saying?


562
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.990
他没说什么有用的
He wasn't really making much sense.


563
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.720
你这解释我可不能接受
This is totally unacceptable.


564
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.830
这可是价值30亿美元的集体诉讼
This is a 3-billion-dollar class-action lawsuit.


565
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.930
到了早上，我不得不给我老板汇报
In the morning, I have to call my board.


566
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:44.660
告诉他们我们这案子的首席辩护律师被逮逋了
I have to tell them that the architect of our entire defense has been arrested­


567
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.990
…因为他在暴风雪中裸奔，并在停车场追赶原告
­for running naked in a snowstorm, chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.


568
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.960
我能理解
I understand.


569
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.060
他说的那疾病到底是什么？
What sickness is he talking about?


570
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.860
-不知道，可能是什么别的东西 -那好，是什么？
-I don't know. It could be anything -Well, give me one.


571
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:58.320
冻伤吧
Frostbite.


572
00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.450
你觉得这很好玩吗？
You think this is funny?


573
00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.890
你看，他的妻子病了，去年去世的
Look, his wife was sick and she died last year.


574
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.520
他的女儿不理他了，他很孤独，他现在的生活就只有你的案子
His daughter doesn't talk to him. He's all alone. All he does is your case.


575
00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.390
他忘了吃药，度过了糟糕的一天，仅此而已
He skipped his pills. He had a bad day. That's it.


576
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.260
看来你是这方面的权威喽？
And you're somehow the authority on this?


577
00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.490
他上次发病是在八年前，当时我在场
His last episode was eight years ago. I was there.


578
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.490
我帮他回到家，看着他好转，就这样
I helped bring him home. I watched him get better. That's it.


579
00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:23.430
行了，凯伦，你雇佣他不是因为他有抑郁证
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy because of his low-key regularity­


580
00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.590
你雇他是因为他是最棒的，因为他的才智…
­you hired him because he's a killer, because he's brilliant­


581
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.420
因为他在这个案子上足够执着努力…
­because he's crazy enough to grind away on this case­


582
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.360
-…6年来无休止地工作着 -打断一下，我们可是给了他工钱的
­for six years without a break -We pay for his time.


583
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.560
我知道你想要个解释
I thought you wanted an explanation.


584
00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.450
到了早上，我会给马蒂·巴赫打电话的
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.


585
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.650
然后么，你也知道的，谢谢你，迈克尔
But, then, you know that. Thank you, Michael.


586
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.620
他大部份时候很平静
He was mostly just quiet.


587
00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.660
我听到他的动静，15分钟前我给他吃了药
I heard him moving around, I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.


588
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.320
-他吃了？ -说到做到，对吧？
-He took it? -A deaI's a deal, right?


589
00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.230
干的不错，埃尔森
A super job, Elston.


590
00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:00.050
你去纽约吧，如果需要入场券或其它什么东西和我说就行
You get to New York, you need tickets to the game or anything, you let me know.


591
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.660
我会把这事办好的
I'll do that for sure.


592
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.660
你见过她了吗？
Did you see her?


593
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.160
-谁？ -安娜
-Who? -Anna.


594
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.090
没有
No.


595
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.820
没有，我没见到她，她可能回农场了
No, I didn't see her. She probably went back to the farm.


596
00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.360
嗯，我们需要她
Well, we need her.


597
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:41.990
马蒂，还有其他的几个人，他们不会明白的
Marty, even then, and the rest of them, they won't understand.


598
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.590
那么如果有人能够给他们解释的话，那人就是你了，亚瑟
Well, if anybody can explain it to them, it's you, Arthur.


599
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.490
不，他们已经迷失方向了
No, they're lost.


600
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.720
-他们已经得到他们想要的了 -别想了，伙计
-They have what they want -Let it go, man.


601
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.730
这就是你想要的？
This what you wanted?


602
00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.820
当个看门的？
To be a janitor?


603
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.350
像这样生活下去？就这样？
Live like this? All this?


604
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.830
做你该做的？
Do what you do?


605
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.620
不可能的
It can't be.


606
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.520
那是…
It's­


607
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.320
那是种负担，这就是我一直想告诉你的
It's a burden, that's what I'm trying to tell you.


608
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.090
就是… 就是这种感觉
That's­  That's how it feels.


609
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:21.720
我知道我们是被召唤的
Well, I know that we've been summoned.


610
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.330
早点睡吧
Get some sleep.


611
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.220
喂
Hello?


612
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.200
你好，我想找韦恩？
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?


613
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.560
你有号码吗？
You have a number?


614
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.820
丹·杰弗瑞给的我这个号码，他说我什么时间打都行
Don Jeffries gave me the number. He said I could call at any time.


615
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.860
不，我是指帐号
No. The account number.


616
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.220
帐号？我有，等一下，我看看
The code? I do. I have it right here. One moment.


617
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.150
稍等片刻
Excuse me one moment.


618
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:06.230
找到了，12-BKR-6
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.


619
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.450
12
-BKR-6

620
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.890
你是韦恩吗？
Am I speaking with Verne?


621
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.300
是的，我是
It's Mr.Verne.


622
00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.790
韦恩先生，不好意思，这么晚打扰你
Mr.Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.


623
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:19.950
丹说我可以…
Don said that I could­


624
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.890
我不是很清楚这东西的用法
I'm not exactly sure how this works.


625
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.060
你现在能上网收电子邮件吗？
Do you have e-mail at your current location?


626
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.450
我有
I do.


627
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.790
-你现在一个人吗？ -是的
-Are you alone? -I am.


628
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:34.790
这样，我会给你上传一个我们常用的小加密包
Okay, I'm gonna upload you a little encryption package we like to use.


629
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.370
那上面写的很清楚
It's pretty self-explanatory.


630
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.820
-好的 -好
-Okay -Okay.


631
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.960
不过你得等几分钟，我得到办公桌那里去，别挂
But you have to give me a minute to get to my desk. Hold on.


632
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.830
好的，谢谢你
Okay. Thank you.


633
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.060
(内部使用) (北地联合克林泰特除草剂内部研究备忘录229号)

634
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.560
(229号内部研究备忘录)

635
00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:57.550
(清楚所有已上市的克林泰特…)

636
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.050
(…能够对人体组织造成伤害…)

637
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.050
(无色、无味… 潜在的致命威胁)

638
00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.720
我想知道的是…
What I was wondering is­


639
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.730
…我是不是有续租六年的优先选择权
­I have an option on the lease for six more years.


640
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.560
我在想有没有办法可解除那种情况
I was wondering if there's any way I could lay that off.


641
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.720
这租约还有价值么？
Is the lease worth anything?


642
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.690
8万9一个月，那…
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's­


643
00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.850
没有装修，但有…
The fixtures are gone, but there's­


644
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:32.760
但还有吧台，还有厨房，那地方不错
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen, it's a great space.


645
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.890
可是还有…
But there's a­


646
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.290
好，我明白了，不，我明白了
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.


647
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.150
好的，好，我会的
Okay, yeah, I will.


648
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.320
好，谢了
All right. Thanks.


649
00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:01.250
好了，亚瑟
Come on, Arthur.


650
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.160
亚瑟！
Arthur!


651
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:07.720
亚瑟，开门
Arthur, open the door.


652
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:13.160
亚瑟，快开门！
Arthur, open the door!


653
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:18.390
亚瑟，快他妈的把门打开！
Arthur, open the goddamn door!


654
00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:20.960
亚瑟，开…！
Arthur, op­!


655
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.860
快他娘的开门！
Open the fucking door!


656
00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.700
亚瑟！
Arthur!


657
00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.130
该死的，亚瑟！快他妈的…！
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking­!


658
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.760
亚瑟？！
Arthur?!


659
00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.410
(相信吧，这绝不只是疯狂)

660
00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.890
-韦恩先生么，你好 -你好，丹尼
-Mr.Verne, hey -Hey, Danny.


661
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.330
你的人来早了，我还在收拾其他的包
You guys are early. I was pulling the other bags.


662
00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:05.370
你可以把它们放在后面，计划有变，抱歉
You can put them back. There's been a change of plans, sorry.


663
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.420
-我们准备好了么？ -是的
-We ready? -Yep.


664
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:13.620
天啊
For chrissake.


665
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.660
丹·杰弗瑞签署的？
Don Jeffries signed this?


666
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:18.690
这真是他的签名？
That's really his signature?


667
00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.830
正本在哪儿？
Where's the original?


668
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:26.060
5年前库房失火了，我们损失了很多档案
We had a warehouse fire five years ago. We lost a number of documents.


669
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.030
这玩意儿怎么会在亚瑟的包里？
What the hell is this doing in Arthur's bag?


670
00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.180
那个，我也不知道，马蒂
Well, I don't know, Marty.


671
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.320
我还希望你能告诉我些事情呢
That's something I was hoping you might be able to tell me.


672
00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.650
我们要找什么？
What are we looking for?


673
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.020
如果提到了U/North公司，就放在一边，任何提到U/North的材料
If it says U/North, pull it aside. Anything that says U/North.


674
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.990
这儿真是一团糟
What a mess this is.


675
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.860
我这儿所有的…
I want all this­


676
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:05.890
…所有的东西，打包后送到办公室去
­everything here, I want it all packed up and sent up to the house.


677
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.390
一切还好么，迈克尔？
Any luck, Michael?


678
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.220
他3点在纽华克机场上了辆出租，在西四大街下了车…
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3, got out at West Fourth Street­


679
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:15.370
…给了司机一张百元大钞当小费，走掉了
­tipped the driver 100 bucks and walked away.


680
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.720
你去过他的公寓了么？
Did you try his apartment?


681
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.050
-他搬家了 -我知道
-He moved -I know.


682
00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.590
那是间阁楼，没有门卫，我按了门铃，没人
It's a loft. No doorman. I rang, nobody answered.


683
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.430
-我打电话，他开了答录机 -那么说他不知去向了
-I called, I got the machine -So he could be anywhere.


684
00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.580
亚瑟住在城里不是什么好事，住什么狗屁阁楼
Arthur downtown is not a good idea. Some goddamn loft.


685
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.490
-他女儿在哪儿？ -我不知道，西班牙或者是印度
-Where's his daughter? -I don't know. Spain, India.


686
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:32.790
马尔斯，比她爸爸还疯狂
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.


687
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.800
巴里接手U/North的事情
Barry's taking over on U/North.


688
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.760
我们又有不少罪要受了
We got a lot of groveling to do.


689
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:39.020
你可不怎么受凯伦·克劳德的欢迎
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.


690
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.420
我被踢开了
I was punting.


691
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.260
你在这儿做好准备，掌控好局面
You gotta saddle up here and get things under control.


692
00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.420
做好什么准备？
Saddle up?


693
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.650
他需要立即接受医生诊断，他需要被允许住院治疗
He needs to be under a doctor's care. He needs to be admitted.


694
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.160
-住哪儿？ -这很重要么？
-Where? -Does that really matter?


695
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.230
迈克尔，U/North想知道他已经被控制住了
Michael, U/North needs to know he's under control.


696
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:56.770
他要在医院里，他们被吓坏了，他们需要恢复信心
He's in a facility. They've been shook up. They need to be reassured.


697
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.120
-没那么容易的 -为什么没那么容易？
-It's not gonna be that easy -Why the hell not?


698
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.090
因为纽约的法律对于进行非自愿的精神治疗要求很严格
Because the laws in New York are pretty tough on involuntary commitment.


699
00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.820
你看了那狗屁录影带了么？
Did you see this fucking tape?


700
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.690
我不和你吵，巴里，我在你说这是怎么回事
I'm not arguing with you, Barry. I'm telling you how it is.


701
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.990
知道么，伙计们？我们这里有600个律师
You know what, guys? We got 600 lawyers in this place.


702
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:14.660
我们为什么不去找一个更了解精神病强制治疗法的人来呢？
Why don't we find out which one knows about psychiatric-commitment statutes?


703
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.490
我现在就可以告诉你为什么，因为他是亚瑟
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.


704
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.150
我在门这儿，准备好进去了
I'm at the door. We're good to go.


705
00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.990
好的，收到，每5分钟通话一次，明白么？
Yeah, roger that. Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?


706
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.320
5分钟一次，收到
Every five minutes, copy that.


707
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.480
你好，这里是亚瑟的答录机
Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.


708
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.920
如果你要留言，请在铃声后开始
If you wish to leave a message, please do so after the tone.


709
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:23.330
亚瑟，快接电话
Arthur, pick up the phone.


710
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.890
亚瑟，快接电话，和我说话
Arthur, pick up the phone and talk to me.


711
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.700
不干？不打算接？
No? Not gonna do it?


712
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:36.580
不管昨天早上发生了什么，忘掉它，没关系的
What happened yesterday morning, forget it. It doesn't matter.


713
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.820
总有一天我们会一笑置之的
Someday you and I are gonna laugh about it.


714
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.460
但你一定要给我回电话
But you gotta call me back.


715
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.030
你要快点儿给我回电话，亚瑟
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.


716
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.300
我告诉你为什么
I'll tell you what.


717
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.450
因为那是你自己说的，这事有些部份确实是很疯狂
Because you said it yourself. Part of this is definitely madness.


718
00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.990
还有一部份是化学药品的原因，我们都清楚
And there's a chemical part. We both know it.


719
00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.390
如果你打算对此采取某些行动…
But if you're willing to start with that­


720
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.680
我非常愿意去协助你，我会告诉你，是的…
­  then I'm more than willing to meet you halfway and say, yes­


721
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.320
…这情况很糟，这案子也很糟，U/North也不是什么好鸟
­this situation sucks. This case sucks. U/North sucks.


722
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.090
我们可以一起行动，好么，亚瑟？你听到了么？
We can start with that. All right, Arthur? You hear me?


723
00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.930
你那时候说的对
You're right about what we are.


724
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.060
我是说你疯了，说你的行为失去了控制
I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying that your behavior is out of control.


725
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.820
但我要告诉你，你说的对
But I'm telling you you're right.


726
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:14.450
你说过，我们是看门人，我承认
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.


727
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.330
但我们为此而来，亚瑟
But we came to this, Arthur.


728
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:22.320
我们一起做过决定，那不是容易的事
We made decisions. It didn't happen overnight.


729
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.580
你不能突然停下来说：“就这样吧，游戏结束了，我进入了神迹”
You can't just suddenly stop and say, "That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."


730
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.320
亚瑟，求求你
Arthur. Come on.


731
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:33.090
该死的，拿起电话来和我说话
Goddamn it, pick up the phone and talk to me.


732
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.600
因为无论你是怎么想的那都很重要…
Because whatever else you think is so important­


733
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.490
你要让我帮助你，因为我会和你谈…
­you better let me help you, because I'm telling you­


734
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:42.860
…直来直去的，看门人和看门人之间，你不用孤军奋战
­janitor to janitor, I don't see anybody else with a broom on the horizon.


735
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.470
是我，伙计，我是…
It's me, buddy. I'm the­

收件箱已满，您的信息不能被录制

737
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.530
-喂 -喂，安娜在么？
-Hello? -Hello. Is Anna there?


738
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.060
稍等
Hang on.


739
00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:58.980
安娜！
Anna!


740
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:03.090
她上哪儿去了？安娜！
Where is she? Anna!


741
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:07.390
-安娜！ -安娜！
-Anna! -Anna!


742
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:10.660
安娜，有你的电话！
Anna, you've got a phone call!


743
00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:15.390
上哪儿去了？安娜！
Where is she? Anna!


744
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.850
喂
Hello?


745
00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.450
安娜，你好，是我，亚瑟
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.


746
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.190
-你好 -你休息得好么？
-Hey -Did you get some sleep?


747
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.190
还行吧
I guess.


748
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.330
你考虑过我们说的事了么？
Did you think about what we said?


749
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:40.120
-是的 -你没告诉别人，是么？
-Yeah -You didn't tell anybody, did you?


750
00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:44.820
没有，我姐姐在监视我，但那很正常
No. My sister's spying on me, but that's normal.


751
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.690
好，因为我就是那个意思
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.


752
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:50.260
我知道，我知道，只是…
I know. I know. It's just­


753
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:55.200
…这件案子里有450个人
­there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.


754
00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.150
你为什么选中我呢？
Why are you choosing me?


755
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:01.830
我也不知道，大概是疯了吧？
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?


756
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:03.560
确实是
That's for sure.


757
00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.700
我是说，真的…？那真的有关系么？
I mean, does it­? Does it really matter?


758
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:10.020
我说，那不是我们所期待的么？遇见某个人？
I mean, isn't it what we wait for? To meet someone? And they're­


759
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.490
他们就像… 就像透镜…
They're like a lens­


760
00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:15.330
你透过他们看世界，突然世界都变了…
­and suddenly you're looking through them and everything changes­


761
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:17.480
…一切都改变了
­and nothing can ever be the same again.


762
00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.320
你跟谁说话呢？
Who you talking to?


763
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.230
找我的，明白吗？也有电话找我的
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.


764
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:23.830
那个人？
That guy?


765
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:27.480
还是那个，还是那个
Same guy. Same guy.


766
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.490
抱歉
Sorry.


767
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:34.830
不，没… 没关系，我妈妈过去也听我打电话
No. That's­  That's okay. My mother used to listen to my calls.


768
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.690
她觉得我什么都做不好
She can't believe I can do anything on my own.


769
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:39.330
嗯，会改变的
Well, that'll change.


770
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.360
我想也是
I guess.


771
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.560
是的，你看，我们可以给她看些东西
Yeah, but, see, that's something we can show her.


772
00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.850
让她知道你能行
That you can do something.


773
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.150
如果你需要，我们可以… 我们可以一起干
That we could­  We could do that together if you want. I mean­


774
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.590
我是说，我是说我可以帮助你
I mean that I can help you do that.


775
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.150
周一我可以搞到1万2
I can get you 12 by Monday.


776
00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.390
1万2太少了，不怎么好
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.


777
00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:01.030
什么意思？
How do you figure that?


778
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:04.760
他们看看7万5，再看看你，他们想知道是哪里出了问题
They look at 75 and they look at you and they wonder what the problem is.


779
00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.020
而你就给了1万2，这会让他们很紧张的
You say 12. That's gonna make people nervous.


780
00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.130
才过了2天，给我点回旋的余地
This was the day before yesterday. Let me get my ducks in order.


781
00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.520
车值多少？
What's the car worth?


782
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:13.890
租的，是公司的
It's a lease. It's the firm's.


783
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:17.960
那么？你去银行，把公寓抵押了，再申请贷款
So? You go to the bank. You've got the apartment. You refinance.


784
00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.760
不行，三个月前我就那么干过了
I can't. I did that three months ago.


785
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.390
你是不是又赌牌去了？
Are you back at the tables?


786
00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.490
看来我得重操旧业了，我没什么闲钱了
Like I need that kind of action. I don't have enough going on.


787
00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:31.690
希望你是在和我说笑呢
I hope you're kidding.


788
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.930
要是他发现你用他的钱玩牌，你就完了
If he finds out you're playing cards with his money, there's no dialogue after that.


789
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.520
行行好吧
Do everyone a favor.


790
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.130
快把你的藏宝图拿出来挖宝吧
Get out the treasure map and start digging.


791
00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:46.390
你有一周的时间
You got a week.


792
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.520
-你好，迈克尔，还好么？ -你好，辛迪，我很好
-Hey, Michael. How are you? -Hi, Cindy. I'm good.


793
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:54.000
请进，他一早上都在打电话，有什么新消息？
Come in. He's been on the phone all morning. What else is new?


794
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.180
我一直在试着让他离开15分钟
I am trying to get him out in 15 minutes.


795
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.790
-他在楼上么？ -他把所有的起居室都占了
-Is he upstairs? -He's taken over the living room.


796
00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:00.860
你们俩小家伙干啥呢？快下来
What are you guys doing? Get down here.


797
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:05.800
索罗约，我告诉过你看好孩子，让他们在楼下玩
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on these kids, make sure they're downstairs.


798
00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:21.790
马蒂？
Marty?


799
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.890
你知道他在干什么吗？他在帮他们打官司
You know what he's doing? He's making their case.


800
00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:30.430
我看了他的文件，我看了这个…
I'm going through his files here, I'm reading this­


801
00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:32.460
…他在把案子办成针对U/North的
­he's building a case against U/North.


802
00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.620
-没人会允许他这么做的 -允许他？
-Nobody's gonna let him do that -Let him?


803
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:36.190
谁能阻止他？
Who the helI's gonna stop him?


804
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.390
你知道我刚听说了什么吗？他在给原告打电话
You know what I just heard? He's calling these plaintiffs.


805
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:43.760
比如作证的那个女的，他现在在联系这些人
This woman from the deposition, he's calling these people now.


806
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.860
他拿到的这些卷宗，简直是他妈的噩梦
He's got these discovery documents. This is a fucking nightmare.


807
00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.590
我试着联系他，留不了言，他的答录机满了
I tried him. Can't even leave a message. He's got the machine jammed up.


808
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:53.290
-那是他的公文包么？ -是啊
-Is that his briefcase? -Yeah.


809
00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.660
-怎么了？ -我们一直在找它
-Why? -We've been looking for it.


810
00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:59.350
我也不知道，它就和他办公室里的其他破烂一起出现了
I don't know. It came up here with all the other stuff from his office.


811
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.260
你肯定不相信他那儿有多少破烂
You can't believe the crap he's got in here.


812
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:05.320
我说，马蒂…
Listen, Marty­


813
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.620
…我在这儿欠了点钱
­I'm in a bind here.


814
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:13.530
我得借点钱，8万块
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.


815
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:17.020
-我还以为你都解决了呢 -还没有
-I thought you were done with that -It's not that.


816
00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.030
不是赌牌欠的，那个不欠了，是餐馆的钱
It's not the cards. It's none of that. It's the restaurant.


817
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.790
8万块
Eighty thousand.


818
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:23.430
很抱歉突然来打扰你
I'm sorry to jump you like this.


819
00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:26.350
两周来我一直试着和你会面
I've been trying to get a meeting with you for two weeks.


820
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.430
还有不管应不应该，我都知道了合并的事
And I know about the merger, whether I'm supposed to or not.


821
00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.520
合并的事还没有定论
There's nothing final on the merger.


822
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:35.630
嗯，那就是为什么我现在问你，你是我的生活来源
Well, that's why I'm asking you now. You're my meal ticket.


823
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:38.450
一旦你退出了，就剩我和巴里还有一屋子的陌生人…
Once you're out, it's me and Barry with strangers­


824
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.530
…我得能解释我究竟干了些什么
­and I'm trying to explain what I do.


825
00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:43.760
所有人都知道你的价值有多大，大家都知道
Everybody knows how valuable you are. Everybody who needs to know.


826
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.590
我都45了，现在还穷得一个子儿也没有
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.


827
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.450
我冲锋陷阵了12年，什么也没得着
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years and I got no equity.


828
00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.220
很抱歉，我觉得心里没底
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.


829
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:52.420
没人让你去开酒吧啊
Nobody told you to go into the bar business.


830
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:55.160
我开酒吧是为了给自己留条后路啊，留着养老啊
I only opened it so I'd have something else, a way out.


831
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.990
我不知道原来你这么不开心
I had no idea you were so unhappy.


832
00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:00.190
我跟你说过多少次了，把我调回诉讼团队里
How many times did I ask you to put me back on a litigation team?


833
00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:02.020
-多少次啊？ -人人都能出庭辩护
-How many? -Anybody can go to court.


834
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:03.430
你觉得那样很特别么？
You think that's special?


835
00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:06.260
-我擅长那个 -很好，很多人也擅长那个
-I was good at it -Wonderful. So are a lot of people.


836
00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:10.090
这件事上，你所做的，很不错
At this, what you do, you're great.


837
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:14.530
看在上帝的份上，你有些东西是别人没有的，你有一个合适的职位
For chrissakes, you got something everybody wants. You have a niche.


838
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.680
你占有一席之地，你为自己挣得了一个合适的位置
You made a place. You made a niche for yourself.


839
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:21.920
如果你还恋旧的话…“你该看看我在皇后区当检察官时干的”
And if it's nostalgia­"You should've seen me when I was a DA back in Queens."


840
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.500
我给你个忠告：忘掉它吧
-Let me give you a serious piece of advice: Leave it there.


841
00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:29.650
上帝不允许你像记忆中的那么好了，我看也是
God forbid you're not as good as you remember. I've seen that happen too.


842
00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.050
但我不是来这听忠告的，不是么？
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?


843
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.920
那这算怎么回事？我借给你钱，要不你就不帮我搞定亚瑟？
So this is what? I give you the loan or you don't help out with Arthur?


844
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.680
-我可没说 -没说？
-I never said that -No?


845
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:40.190
也许你该那么说
Maybe you should have.


846
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:45.030
我不知道你打算怎么处理这事，但这件事就像癌症一样
I don't know how you're gonna take care of this, but this, this is cancer.


847
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:48.350
如果我们不迅速地控制住局面，赶快清理干净的话…
This is something, we don't get it reined in and cleaned up soon­


848
00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.650
…那么一切都完了，一切
­everything's vulnerable. Everything.


849
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.800
-你想跟我说什么？ -我全靠你了
-What are you telling me? -That I'm counting on you.


850
00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:59.120
我告诉你，到下周的这个时候，亚瑟要在掌控之中…
I'm telling you that by this time next week, Arthur will be under control­


851
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.860
…然后大家就都会记得你那无穷的价值的
­and everybody who needs to will have been reminded of your infinite value.


852
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.330
上帝啊，马蒂
Jesus, Marty.


853
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:06.000
嘿
Hey.


854
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.180
你什么时候变得他妈的这么软弱了？
When did you get so fucking delicate?


855
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.850
我要迟到了
I'm late.


856
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:53.520
你为什么不找吉奈叔叔请警察来帮忙呢？
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene and get the cops to help you?


857
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:55.720
不是那么回事
It's not that kind of a problem.


858
00:56:57.350 --> 00:56:59.760
-我们干这个要多长时间？ -我不知道
-How much longer are we doing this? -I don't know.


859
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:15.560
如果他回来取车，你就拨这个电话告诉我
If he comes back to get his car, you call that number and let me know.


860
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.850
-多谢了，非常感谢 -好的，不客气
-Thank you very much. I appreciate it -Okay. You're welcome.


861
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:29.220
如果我们不是去看电影，你为什么不直说呢？
If we're not gonna get to the movie, why don't you just say so?


862
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.160
-什么？ -我要回家
-What? -I wanna go home.


863
00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.130
别闹，亨利
Come on, Henry.


864
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.520
等下！
Hold up!


865
00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:43.430
呆在车里，把门锁好
Stay in the car. Lock the door.


866
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:48.030
亚瑟！亚瑟！
Arthur! Arthur!


867
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.520
等等
Wait up.


868
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:53.760
迈克尔，天啊，你吓了我一跳
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.


869
00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.890
-送货去？ -不，不，不是
-Making a delivery? -No, no, no.


870
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.360
挺搞笑，不是，不是那么回事
Very funny. No, nothing like that.


871
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:05.130
给，拿一根，拿着，还… 还热呢
Here, take one, please. Really. It's­  It's still warm.


872
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:06.920
这是我吃过的最香的面包
It's the best bread I ever tasted.


873
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:12.690
欢迎回来
So welcome home.


874
00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.790
我知道，宾馆的事，很抱歉
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.


875
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:19.330
我感觉有点儿压抑
I was beginning to feel a little overwhelmed.


876
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:21.330
-你现在感觉好些了么？ -是啊
-But you're feeling better now? -Yeah.


877
00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:23.990
-好多了，确实 -还没好到能给我回电话
-Much better, definitely -Not enough to call me back.


878
00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:27.390
嗯，那个，在打电话之前，我想…
Well, I was trying to gather my thoughts­


879
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:31.150
整理好我的思路，就是这么回事
­before I called you, and that's what I was doing.


880
00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:33.200
那件事怎么样？
And how's that going?


881
00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.820
很好，非常好，就是…
Yes, it's good, very good. I just­


882
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:41.530
嗯，就是我需要把思路理得更清晰些，那就是…
Well, I just need to make my thoughts a little bit more precise. That's­


883
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:42.990
那就是我的目标
That's my goal.


884
00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:46.520
和这感觉一样的是你知道它会怎么发展
As good as this feels, you know where it goes.


885
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:48.090
不，不，你错了
No. No. You're wrong.


886
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:51.350
这感觉之所以好，是因为我不知道它会怎么发展
What makes this feel good is that I don't know where it goes.


887
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.690
我怎么跟你说呢，亚瑟？你听我的吗？
How do I talk to you, Arthur? So you hear me?


888
00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:00.390
像个孩子？像个混球？还是好像一切都好？
Like a child? Like a nut? Like everything's fine?


889
00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:04.330
你有什么秘密？因为我需要你听我说
What's the secret? Because I need you to hear me.


890
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.250
-嗯，我什么都听的 -那么听着这个
-Well, I hear everything -Then hear this.


891
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:11.650
你需要帮助，在事情无法挽回之前，你需要帮助
You need help. Before this goes too far, you need help.


892
00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.060
你的牌很好
You got great cards here.


893
00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:16.560
要是你能把衣服穿好，你爱他妈干什么就干什么
If you keep your clothes on, you can do any goddamn thing you want.


894
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:19.960
你想不干了，你就可以不干了，你想烤面包，烤去呗
You want out, you're out. You wanna bake bread, go with God.


895
00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.830
这一大堆破事里你就办错了一件…
There's only one wrong answer in this whole goddamn pile­


896
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:24.760
…但你还护着短儿不承认
­and you've got your arms around it.


897
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:28.220
-好吧，我说了我很抱歉 -你觉得那旅馆很压抑？
-Well, I said I was sorry -You thought the hotel was overwhelming?


898
00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.950
你让这案子难过，他们就会打断你的腿
You piss on this case, they'll cut you off at the knees.


899
00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.400
-我不知道你在说什么 -我在给你收拾烂摊子
-I don't know what you're talking about -I'm covering for you.


900
00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:38.050
我跟他们说一切都好，你很好，一切都会好的，大家都很好
I'm telling them everything's fine. You're fine. Everybody's cool.


901
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.460
我到处给人讲“天才的价值”的故事
I'm out running this "price of genius" story to anybody who'll listen.


902
00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:45.850
但今天早上我一起来，就听说你和这个威斯康星来的姑娘联系上了
And then I wake up this morning and I hear you're calling this girl from Wisconsin­


903
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.890
…还有什么该死的文件和其他一些破烂儿
­messing with documents and whatever else.


904
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:50.590
-你怎么知道的？ -他们掌控着一切
-How can you know that? -They're gonna take everything.


905
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.260
你的合伙身份、你的流通股，他们会吊销你的执照
Your partnership, your equity. They're gonna pull your license.


906
00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.580
-你怎么知道我给安娜打了电话？ -马蒂告诉我的
-How do you know I called Anna? -Marty told me.


907
00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.530
-那么，他怎么知道的？ -我不知道，我可没胡扯！
-Well, how does he know? -I don't know. I don't give a shit!


908
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.160
-你在窃听我的电话 -天啊，亚瑟
-You're tapping my phone -Jesus, Arthur.


909
01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:08.190
那么解释一下，告诉我马蒂怎么知道的！
Then explain it. Tell me how Marty knows!


910
01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:13.230
因为你晃着小弟弟追着个姑娘跑过了整个停车场
Because you're chasing a girl through a parking lot with your dick hanging out.


911
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:16.220
你觉得她不会拿起电话打给她的律师么？
You think she didn't get off the phone and dial her attorney?


912
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:18.260
不，她不会那么做的，我清楚这一点
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.


913
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.420
真的？你认为你的判断力已经达到“艺术欣赏”的水平了么？
Really? You think your judgment is state-of-the-art right now?


914
01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:27.190
他们准备要亮底牌了，你得停下来好好想想
They're putting everything on the table. You need to stop and think this through.


915
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:28.880
我会帮你一起想的
I'll help you think this through.


916
01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:31.290
我会找人帮你想想的
I'll find somebody to help you think it through.


917
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:35.630
别这样，你这样会便宜了他们
Don't do this. You're making it easy for them.


918
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.460
迈克尔，我非常喜欢你的为人
Michael, I have great affection for you.


919
01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:44.930
你过着丰富多彩的生活，但你只是个跑腿的，不是辩护律师
You lead a very rich and interesting life, but you're a bagman, not an attorney.


920
01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.360
如果你想要控告我…
If you wanted to have me committed­


921
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.390
你最好让我呆在威斯康星州，那里有逮捕记录
­you should have kept me in Wisconsin, where the arrest report, the videotape­


922
01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:54.230
…录像带和目击证人来证明我有不当行为…
­and eyewitness accounts of my inappropriate behavior­


923
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:56.360
…那里才有审判管辖权
­would have had jurisdictional relevance.


924
01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:58.930
我在纽约州没有任何犯罪记录
I have no criminal record in the state of New York.


925
01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:04.630
对于非自愿监禁的唯一判断标准就是威胁性
And the single determining criterion for involuntary incarceration is danger.


926
01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:08.160
被告是否对自己或者他人造成了威胁？
Is the defendant a danger to himself or others?


927
01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.020
你觉得你整明白了吗？
You think you got the horses for that?


928
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.930
好了，祝你好运，愿上帝保佑你，但我要告诉你：
Well, good luck and God bless. But I tell you this:


929
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:19.320
你绝对不会愿意在法庭上见到我的
The last place you want to see me is in court.


930
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:21.990
我不是你的敌人
I'm not the enemy.


931
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.520
那你是谁？
Then who are you?


932
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.060
我们发现种子
We find the seed.


933
01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.160
我们保育土壤
We shape the soil.


934
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:50.190
我们加速收获
We speed the harvest.


935
01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:54.300
我们抚育星球
We feed the planet.


936
01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.750
我们发现种子
We find the seed.


937
01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:13.730
我们保育土壤
We shape the soil.


938
01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.960
我们加速收获
We speed the harvest.


939
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.390
我们抚育星球
We feed the planet.


940
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:42.460
这小子干啥呢？
What the hell is he doing?


941
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:01.720
我们发现种子
We find the seed.


942
01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:07.020
您现在访问的是肯纳、巴赫和莱迪恩事务所亚瑟·伊顿的语音信箱
You've reached the voicemail of Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.


943
01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.060
请在提示音后留言
Please leave your message after the tone.


944
01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:11.020
好啊！
Yes!


945
01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:15.230
是我啊，大伙，大家都在听吗？
Here we are, all together. Is everyone listening?


946
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.830
这就是你们期待已久的时刻，一页非常特别的报告
This is the moment you've been waiting for. A very special piece of paper.


947
01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.520
让我们用充满病态和恶意的掌声欢迎…
So let's have a big, paranoid, malignant round of applause­


948
01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:27.960
北地联合克林泰特内部研究备忘录229号
­  for United Northfield Culcitate Internal Research Memorandum 229.


949
01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.390
1991年1月19日发布
June 19th, 1991.


950
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:33.290
结论如下：
"Conclusion:


951
01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.120
克林泰特所取得的出乎意料的市场增长…
The unanticipated market growth for Culcitate­


952
01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:41.520
是基于小型农庄在寒冷气候下的即时成本—利益分析
­by small farms in colder climates demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."


953
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:45.370
你们这帮家伙想不想听点儿法律建议？
Would you guys like a little bit of legal advice?


954
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.390
永远不要让科学家把“出乎意料”…
Never let a scientist use the words "unanticipated"­


955
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:51.650
…和“即时”放在一个句子里
­and "immediate" in the same sentence.


956
01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.660
明白了吧？好的
Okay? Okay.


957
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:56.260
内部土地试验显示…
"In-house field studies have indicated­


958
01:03:56.420 --> 01:04:01.160
小型短期农庄人类活动所必需的井水…
­  that small short-season farms dependent on well water for human consumption­


959
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.480
其中的毒素颗粒有聚集到…
­  are at risk for toxic particulate concentrations at levels­


960

…能够对人体组织造成损害的程度的风险
­significant enough to cause serious human tissue damage."


961
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.130
这个么，绕了半天，就是要说…
Well, this is a long way of saying that­


962
01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:15.630
你都不用离开房子就能被我们的产品干掉了
­you don't even have to leave your house to be killed by our product.


963
01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:17.850
我们把毒药直接送到你们家厨房
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.


964
01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.160
-克林泰特它无味、无色而且不易凝结… -把电话给我
-"Culcitate's great market advantage­ -Give me the phone.


965
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.230
这所谓的巨大市场优势…
­  that it is tasteless, colorless and does not precipitate­


966
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:27.050
有可能掩盖并加强…
­  has the potential to mask and intensify­


967
01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.790
…露天放置导致的潜在致命威胁
­these potentially lethal exposures."


968
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.760
现在，我喜欢这东西了
Now, I love this.


969
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.830
这不仅是个伟大的产品…
Not only is this a great product­


970
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:37.690
…还是个超级癌症制造系统
­it is a superb cancer delivery system.


971
01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:40.590
克林泰特产品化学成份的改变…
"Chemical modifications of the Culcitate product­


972
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:44.960
添加某种检测分子，比如气味分子或有色分子…
­  the addition of a detector molecule, such as an odorant or colorant­


973
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.990
…将会需要自上而下地重新设计克林泰特的整个生产工序
­  would require a top-down redesign of the Culcitate manufacturing process.


974
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.260
这方面的花费，由于太过巨大…
These costs, while assumed to be significant­


975
01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.230
…将不在此处进行计算
­  were not summarized here. "


976
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:57.320
这个么，笼统地说，意思就是：
Which, loosely translated, means:


977
01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.550
这玩意儿改好要破好大一笔财，而我就是个实验室里的小喽啰…
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab­


978
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.860
…因此有没有别人能做个决定啊？
­so could someone else please make the decision?"


979
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.720
很明显，这份内部研究文档的发布…
"Clearly, the release of these internal research documents­


980
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.590
将会动摇克林泰特的有效市场份额…
­  would compromise the effective marketing of Culcitate­


981
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:15.450
因此必须被定为…
­and must be kept within the protective confines­


982
01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.720
北地联合公司的商业机密
­of United-Northfield's trade secret language."


983
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:24.620
你们不需要我给你们解释了吧
You don't need me to tell you what that means.


984
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:26.190
再见
Goodbye.


985
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.420
-看来我要… -是
-It seemed to warrant my coming to­ -Yes.


986
01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.850
你必须要控制住局势
You have to contain this.


987
01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.820
-控制住？ -对
-Contain? -Right.


988
01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:42.420
好吧，那是我的问题
Well, that's my question.


989
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:47.520
我们…？我们有什么解决方案么？
What are the­? What's the option that we're looking at?


990
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.520
对于这个情况
Along those lines.


991
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:52.720
你是说那些文件、数据？我不知…
You're talking about the paper, the data? I don't­


992
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.060
嗯，我在想是不是还有其他选择
Well, I'm wondering if there is some other option.


993
01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.090
我是说有什么我没想到的？
I mean something I'm not thinking of?


994
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.800
我们什么都能干
We deal in absolutes.


995
01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.860
好的，我明白，我明白了
Okay. I understand that. I do.


996
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:11.460
那些材料、资料，我又不是律师，我们试试看，尽力吧
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer. We try, we do what we can.


997
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.460
嗯，其他手段呢？
Well, the other way?


998
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:17.360
其他手段
Is the other way.


999
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:23.750
-也许你该把丹找来处理这事 -不
-Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this -No.


1000
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.410
这事和丹没关系，他很忙，这和他没关系
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy. This is nothing to do with Don.


1001
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.150
你觉得可行么？
Do you think it's doable?


1002
01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.890
嗯，我们有些好主意，你说行动，我们就行动
Yeah. We have some good ideas. You say move, we move.


1003
01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:44.160
如果这主意看起来不怎么好，我们就按兵不动，再想想看
If the ideas don't look so good, we back off, reassess­


1004
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.650
好吧
Okay.


1005
01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:53.190
你的意思是“好吧，你明白了”还是“好吧，行动”？
Is that, "Okay, you understand," or "Okay, proceed"?


1006
01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.720
你1岁？你2岁？你3岁？
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?


1007
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.020
你4岁？你5岁？你6岁？
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?


1008
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:05.390
-你7岁？你8岁？你9岁？ -行了
-Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9? -Come on.


1009
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.990
行了，行了，我说了，嘿！
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!


1010
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:10.730
别说了
Come on.


1011
01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:12.560
好了，爸爸，许愿吧
Go on, Dad, make a wish.


1012
01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.670
要是愿望成真，我就爽死了
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.


1013
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:18.120
你是个狂人，不可思议
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.


1014
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.230
帮我一把，埃迪，哈？
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?


1015
01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.530
好的，埃迪
All right, Eddie.


1016
01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:27.990
嗯，不是我自己做的，不好吃别赖我
Now, I did not make this myself and I don't wanna hear any complaints.


1017
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.590
生日快乐
Happy birthday.


1018
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.530
你有时间吃蛋糕么？
You have time for cake?


1019
01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.290
有，有啊，我吃一块再走
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.


1020
01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.450
要走了？
You going in?


1021
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.350
-我已经迟到了 -该死
-I'm late already -Shit.


1022
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.930
你俩不是都没钱了吧？
You're not both running out?


1023
01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.860
我有点儿状况
I got a situation.


1024
01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.690
-你挺不住了 -你要走了
-You can't hang? -You're going in.


1025
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.220
-是啊，我要轮班 -我也有
-Yeah. I got a shift -So do I.


1026
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:50.360
得了吧，伙计，好几个月你都没来了
Come on, man. You haven't been up here in months.


1027
01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.460
要是你现在就回去，米奇(迈克尔的昵称)，亨利要留在这儿
If you go back now, Mickey, Henry's staying here.


1028
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.990
好吧，你可以开车送他回去
Good. You can drive him home.


1029
01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.590
就呆一个小时
Just stay for an hour.


1030
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:59.960
姑娘们才干这事呢
The girls did all this stuff.


1031
01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:02.260
他那时候就睡着了
He'll be asleep by then.


1032
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:08.220
提米给我打电话了
Timmy's been calling me.


1033
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:13.720
他不敢跟你谈
He's afraid to talk to you.


1034
01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.030
他是不敢
He should be.


1035
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:17.780
-清仓不怎么顺利，是吧？ -他是这么跟你说的？
-It closed out bad, right? -Is that what he told you?


1036
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:19.930
孩子们都吓坏了
The kids are freaking out.


1037
01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:21.660
亲戚们也吓坏了
The in-laws are freaking out.


1038
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:25.650
帕米害怕得哭个不停
Pammy can't stop crying long enough to start freaking out.


1039
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:29.490
-她把他领回去了 -那能怎样？去他妈的老婆孩子？
-She took him back -So what? Fuck her and the kids?


1040
01:08:29.650 --> 01:08:32.290
不，去他妈的提米，一切都没完，明白么？
No. Fuck Timmy. And nothing's closed, okay?


1041
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:36.150
我把所有东西都卖了，但我们还是差点儿，所以别老提什么帕米和孩子
I sold everything and we're still short. So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.


1042
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.380
我全担下来了
I got my hands full.


1043
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.260
这事要是你，他就不会这么懒
If it was you, he'd be in traction.


1044
01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.560
好了，他病了，行了吧？
Yeah, he's sick, all right?


1045
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.960
-他有病，那是种病 -这观点挺新鲜
-He's sick. It's a sickness -There's a fresh perspective.


1046
01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.390
最近我看到不少人旧瘾复发，到处都是
I've seen a lot of people falling off the wagon lately. It's going around.


1047
01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.150
你是在说我么？
Is that pointed at me?


1048
01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:01.190
我什么时候见过你？我怎么知道你都在忙啥？
When do I see you? How do I know what you're up to?


1049
01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:03.730
我有一年多没赌钱了
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.


1050
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.380
我有10个月没进过扑克室了
I haven't been in a card room in 10 months.


1051
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:09.620
我把宝押在了酒吧上，押在了提米身上，结果他给我搞砸了
I gambled on the bar. I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.


1052
01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:11.350
那就是我的大买卖，行了吧？
That was my big play, all right?


1053
01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.350
我把养老的钱都投进去了，现在没了，我穷困潦倒
I put up my walk-away money and it's gone and I'm scrambling.


1054
01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.120
好了，好了
Okay. Okay.


1055
01:09:19.150 --> 01:09:21.130
冷静点儿，我听着呢
Cool down. I hear you.


1056
01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.080
我也被耍了
I'd be pissed off too.


1057
01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.980
等1个小时就好
Just hang for an hour.


1058
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.950
-好么？ -好吧
-Okay? -Yeah.


1059
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.620
准备好了？好，抬
Ready? And, lift.


1060
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:18.120
预备，走
Ready and go.


1061
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:43.120
擦擦
Wipe.


1062
01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:54.200
你可以扎了
You better hit it.


1063
01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:29.090
搞定了
We're good.


1064
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:06.510
好的，我找到了，这是他的号码
Okay, I found it. That's his number.


1065
01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.720
穆林大夫，看你的运气了
Dr.Mullien. See if you have any more luck.


1066
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.830
好吧，如果我能，我一有机会就去
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.


1067
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.090
有医疗补助的，我们都有，我可以给你文件…
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles. I can pull the file­


1068
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.120
让他走吧，斯蒂芬，他有约会
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.


1069
01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.550
我和一个疯狂律师有约
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.


1070
01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.320
-晚上别工作了，米奇 -你看起来很疲倦
-Take a night off, Mickey -You look tired.


1071
01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:23.490
-我没事，回见 -好好的
-I'm okay. See you soon -Be good.


1072
01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:25.880
-好了，再见 -再见，亨利
-All right. Bye -Bye, Hen.


1073
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.750
-再见，爸爸 -再见
-Bye, Pop -Bye.


1074
01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:40.160
-提米叔叔，你好啊！ -你怎么样啊，亨利？
-Uncle Timmy, hey! -How you doing, Henry?


1075
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.660
亨利，快上车
Henry, get in the car.


1076
01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.750
见到你很高兴，亨利
Good to see you, Hen.


1077
01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:50.420
-你想要什么？ -我已经戒酒8天了
-What do you want? -I've been sober eight days now.


1078
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:55.080
出来见几个面，我想让你知道
Been back at the meetings. I wanted you to know.


1079
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.880
在孩子面前？
In front of the kid?


1080
01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:00.550
米奇，求你了，我知道我曾经有多坏，我发誓
Mickey, please. I know how bad I did, I swear.


1081
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:05.160
我不知道该怎么走上正轨，我满脑子想的都是这个
I don't know how to make it right again. It's all I think about.


1082
01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:07.950
我该怎么做？我知道干什么
What do I do? I don't know what to do.


1083
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:11.580
把轮胎还给斯蒂芬娜
Get Stephanie her tires back.


1084
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:19.830
-他哭了？ -不知道
-Is he crying? -I don't know.


1085
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.820
因为吸了毒，是么？
Because of drugs, right?


1086
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:23.790
差不多就那玩意儿
That and everything else.


1087
01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.590
怎么了？
What?


1088
01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:00.220
你提米叔叔…
Your Uncle Timmy­


1089
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.380
我是说，在他最风光的时候也没有像你这样坚强
­and I mean this, on his best day, is never as tough as you.


1090
01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:10.590
我不是说他哭了，或者吸毒什么的
I'm not talking about crying or the drugs or anything.


1091
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.850
我是在说他的心，内心里，你明白么？
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart. You understand me?


1092
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.790
他就会胡诌，吹的天花乱坠的
And all his charming bullshit, this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit­


1093
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:21.150
…我知道你爱他，我知道为什么
­and I know you love him, and I know why.


1094
01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.130
但当你看见他那熊样…
But when you see him like that­


1095
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:26.050
…你不必担心，你不会成为那样的人的
­you don't have to worry. That's not how it'll be for you.


1096
01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:28.780
你不会成为那种天天慨叹…
You're not gonna be someone that goes through life­


1097
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:32.550
…为什么自己老是踩到臭狗屎的人
­wondering why shit keeps falling out of the sky around them.


1098
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.130
我知道，我知道这一点
I know that. I know it.


1099
01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:36.590
明白么？
Okay?


1100
01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.980
每次我看着你我都能看出这一点来，我现在就能看到
I see it every time I look at you. I see it right now.


1101
01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.020
我不知道你是从哪儿获得的，但你确实有
I don't know where you got it from, but you got it.


1102
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.060
明白么？
Okay?


1103
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.550
喂
Hello?


1104
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:21.460
邻居过来了，他们在修理楼下的阁楼
The neighbors came by. They're renovating the loft downstairs.


1105
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:26.250
他们发现有水流从他的盥洗室流到下面
They had water flooding from his bathroom down to their place.


1106
01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:31.890
他的前门、紧急通道，都被他锁得严严实实
His front door, fire escape, he had everything locked up pretty good.


1107
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:36.390
我的人花了10分钟才进去，还不得不把门砸掉
It took our guys 10 minutes. They had to knock the thing down.


1108
01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:40.330
到处都是药丸
There's pills all over the place.


1109
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.180
完全就是自杀的现场
Just the scene alone is pretty definitive for suicide.


1110
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.290
然后我问了一些最近处理过这种事的…
Then I spoke to some of your partners­


1111
01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:53.050
你的老熟人，因此…
­who ran down these problems he'd been having lately, so­


1112
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:58.550
-有遗言么？ -没有，他们看过了
-Is there a note? -No. They looked.


1113
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.690
可能是个意外或者他本打算写遗言但没写成
It could be an accident or he was gonna write a note and just messed up.


1114
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:06.050
我能进去么？
Can I get in there?


1115
01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:09.250
他的住处？现在不行，已经封闭了
His place? Not now. It's sealed.


1116
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:14.120
一旦现场封闭，一切都冻结了，我们会试着联系他的女儿
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen. We're gonna try and reach his daughter.


1117
01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:17.420
我想她在欧洲，但她就要回来了
I guess she's off in Europe. But she's gotta come in.


1118
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:21.120
还要等尸检官的毒物报告检测结果
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back with a toxicology report.


1119
01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.980
至少要花几周的时间，只能那样了
That's a couple of weeks at least that it's gotta stay like that.


1120
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.790
抱歉
Sorry.


1121
01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.290
没事
Sure.


1122
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:37.550
好吧
Okay.


1123
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:46.380
我认识你弟弟，我妻子在皇后区那边做事
I know your brother a little. My wife works the 190 out in Queens.


1124
01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:49.180
代我向他问好
I'll tell him hello.


1125
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:51.380
如果有什么新情况，我会和你联系的
If something comes in, I'll get back to you.


1126
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:53.630
好的，谢谢你
Yeah. I appreciate it.


1127
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:55.580
对您的损失感到很难过
I'm sorry for your loss.


1128
01:17:14.050 --> 01:17:16.650
-迈克尔 -杰夫
-Michael -Jeff.


1129
01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:18.290
这真难过
This is tough.


1130
01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:20.050
是，是啊，他在这儿么？
Yeah, it is. He in here?


1131
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:33.790
沉默寡言的混球
Dumb son of a bitch.


1132
01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:35.410
多么可怕
What a thing.


1133
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:37.820
-稍等 -我都不知道…
-Hold on -I don't even know­


1134
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:39.890
-真抱歉 -嗯，没关系
-I'm so sorry -Yeah. All right.


1135
01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:43.290
我都没机会和他聊聊
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.


1136
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.910
那个该死的老疯子
That crazy goddamn bastard.


1137
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:50.450
多大的损失啊，他到底在想什么？
What a waste. What the hell was he thinking?


1138
01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.960
马蒂？我得处理一下这事
Marty? I gotta set this up.


1139
01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.650
去，去吧
Go. Go.


1140
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:56.720
你还好吧？
You okay?


1141
01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:59.220
嗯，还好
Yeah, I'm fine.


1142
01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.550
来，咱们喝一杯
Come on, let's get you a drink.


1143
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:09.620
我一直在回味这件事，比如，是不是我给他的压力太大了？
I just keep replaying all this back. Like, did I push him too hard?


1144
01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:11.020
不可能
Not a chance.


1145
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.990
我一直没法和他沟通
I just couldn't get through to him.


1146
01:18:13.150 --> 01:18:16.320
得了，你把他吓死了？算了吧，那家伙倔得像头牛
What, you scared him to death? Come on. The man was a bull.


1147
01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:20.420
-不是那样的 -他后来为什么屈服了？为什么他…？
-Never happened -Why does he fold, then? Why does he­?


1148
01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:24.330
那一定是场意外
It's gotta be an accident.


1149
01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:26.050
不，不可能，亚瑟会没留下便条？
No, no. Arthur without a note?


1150
01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:29.190
他连撒个尿都要写个备忘录呢，一定是意外
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo. Has to be an accident.


1151
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:31.620
我不相信，我搞不明白
I don't get that. I don't understand that either.


1152
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.030
前一分钟他还打算控制全世界…
One minute he's gonna take on the whole world­


1153
01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:37.210
…12小时之后，他却自行了断了，为什么呢？
­and then 12 hours later, he's sucking down pills. Why?


1154
01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:38.790
为什么？
Why?


1155
01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:43.420
因为所有人都是他妈的不可理喻的，“为什么？”
Because people are fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"


1156
01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.750
我认识亚瑟30年了
Thirty years I know Arthur.


1157
01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:52.890
好日子啊
Good years.


1158
01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:58.590
如果我够诚实，我现在的感觉是什么？
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?


1159
01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.920
我说不出来，太糟了
I can't even say, it's so awful.


1160
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.720
你能说的
You can say it.


1161
01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:11.160
我们只不过比他幸运些
We caught a lucky break.


1162
01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.450
确实啊，不是么？
We did, didn't we?


1163
01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:24.590
马蒂？我们得去一下办公室
Marty? We need to get up to the office.


1164
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.480
-他们同意了？ -原则上
-They accepted? -In principle.


1165
01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:29.490
丹·杰弗瑞要我们半小时内听电话
Don Jeffries wants us on the phone in half an hour.


1166
01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:32.560
我试着解释亚瑟的事，但他们没有什么同情心
I tried to explain about Arthur, but they're short on sympathy.


1167
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.630
等一下，U/North自己处理的？
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?


1168
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:38.850
他们看到了一线希望，他们想试试，这是他们的事，我们能干什么？
They see a window. They wanna try. It's their show. What are we gonna do?


1169
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.720
你尽力了，迈克尔，我们都尽力了
You did what you could, Michael. We all did.


1170
01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.450
这是…
It's­


1171
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:48.280
这就是我们得到的
It's what we got.


1172
01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.260
-你需要送一下么？ -不，谢了，我很好
-You need a ride? -No, thanks, I'm fine.


1173
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.010
喂
Hello.


1174
01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:28.780
喂，你好，我找安娜·凯泽森
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.


1175
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:30.050
你是谁？
Who is this?


1176
01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:33.720
迈克尔·克莱顿，我是纽约的一名律师，我是从亚瑟那里得到你的号码的
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in New York. I got your number from Arthur.


1177
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:36.750
-你们可真有种阿 -什么？
-You have got some nerve -Excuse me?


1178
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:40.720
你们让她飞到纽约去，还把她一个人留在机场？
You get her all the way to New York City and then leave her at the airport?


1179
01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.720
她是个单纯的人
This is not a complicated person.


1180
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:45.720
这姑娘从来没去过比密尔沃基远的地方
This is a girl who's never been farther than Milwaukee.


1181
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.880
-等一下，等等 -不，你等着
-Wait a minute. Now, wait -No, you wait.


1182
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:52.290
她明天就要回家了，她回来以后，你们要是再…
She's coming home tomorrow and when she does, if you call here again­


1183
01:20:52.450 --> 01:20:54.760
你是说她现在在纽约么？
Are you telling me she's in New York right now?


1184
01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:57.210
这还是个小姑娘，你听着没有？
This is a young girl, do you hear me?


1185
01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:59.820
她现在就在城里？
She's in the city right now?


1186
01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.550
你是什么人？
What kind of people are you?


1187
01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:04.750
听着，等我一会儿，就一会儿
Listen. You just stay on the phone one second. One second.


1188
01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:38.650
安娜
Anna.


1189
01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:42.550
安娜？
Anna?


1190
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:46.320
我叫迈克尔·克莱顿，是亚瑟的一个朋友
My name's Michael Clayton. I'm a friend of Arthur's.


1191
01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.150
我问了你姐姐，她说你在这儿
I spoke with your sister. She told me you were here.


1192
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:52.330
请开开门，安娜
Please open the door, Anna.


1193
01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:05.320
你怎么看？
What are you thinking?


1194
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:11.430
不知道，我望风，你去搜他的车，找点儿线索
I don't know. I'll watch the door. You check his car. Let's get some details.


1195
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:17.520
他没有详细说是怎么回事
He didn't want to say exactly what it was.


1196
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.230
就说我来了之后，他会来接我…
Just that when I got here, he would pick me up­


1197
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:25.750
然后给我看些东西，我会见到…
­and show me, and I would see­


1198
01:22:26.710 --> 01:22:29.590
…能使整件案子翻盘的东西
­that it was something that would win the whole case.


1199
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:34.660
即使在今天早上…
Even this morning­


1200
01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:36.410
…我是说，我想：
­I mean, I thought:


1201
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:42.620
好吧，如果我到了机场没有票的话我就明白了
"Okay, if I get to the airport and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.


1202
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:47.880
好了，你很蠢，你可以回家了
Okay, you're stupid, and you can go home now."


1203
01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:55.320
但确实有票，他付过钱了，好像是800块…
But it was there and he paid, like, 800 dollars­


1204
01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:58.150
…一张头等舱
­for a first-class ticket.


1205
01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.790
我只是…
And I just­


1206
01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.650
我上了飞机
I got on the plane.


1207
01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:10.360
我相信他了
I believed him.


1208
01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:19.790
你有没有觉得他可能在某种程度上来说感到失望了？
You think maybe he was in some way disappointed?


1209
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:24.610
这么说吧，他知道你告诉了其他人这一切…
Let's say that he knew that you told somebody else about all of this­


1210
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:28.220
…然后，我也说不大好，在某些程度上，他对你那样做感到失望？
­and, I don't know, in some crazy way, he was disappointed by that?


1211
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.230
-但我没那么做 -你一定是跟别人说了
-But I didn't -You must have told somebody else.


1212
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:33.950
没有
No.


1213
01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.280
他让我发誓了
He made me promise.


1214
01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:43.160
你没跟别人讲这件事？一个都没有？
You didn't tell anybody else about this? Not one other person?


1215
01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:45.690
没有
No.


1216
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:53.400
他其实是真疯了，不是么？
He really was crazy, wasn't he?


1217
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:08.990
-你是说这个么？ -让我看看
-You talking about this? -Let me see.


1218
01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.160
-你知道这是什么吗？ -知道
-You know what that is? -Yeah.


1219
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:16.150
你就说帮个“小忙”，这可比“小忙”大多了
You said a favor. That's more than a favor.


1220
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:18.480
好了，没人知道这是从哪儿来的
Well, nobody's gonna know where it came from.


1221
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:22.290
-是你那事耽搁了么？ -你什么意思？
-Are you that jammed up? -What are you talking about?


1222
01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:25.080
谁需要这玩意儿？是餐馆的事，是吧？
Who asked for this? It's the restaurant, right?


1223
01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.750
是你的某个债主么？“给我搞个封条”
One of these guys you owe? "Get me a seal."


1224
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:29.550
你真的想知道么？
You really wanna know?


1225
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.020
这事越来越有意思了
This just gets better and better.


1226
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:52.250
我们干点儿什么呢？
What are we doing?


1227
01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.070
(“最佳打印”委托印刷清单)

1228
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:54.810
别动！
Freeze!


1229
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:57.720
呆着别动，你个混蛋！别动！
Right there, asshole! Don't move!


1230
01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.160
-好吧，我没恶意，我是个朋友！ -举起手来！
-It's all right, I'm a friend! -Get your hands up!


1231
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.850
快把手举起来！快点儿！
Get your hands up now! Now!


1232
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.950
-你手里是什么？ -是本书
-What's in your hand? -It's a book.


1233
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.990
放下！快放下！快点儿！
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!


1234
01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:11.460
-转过来，慢点儿 -好的，好的，转了
-Turn around. Slowly -All right. All right. Okay.


1235
01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.460
-这儿还有谁？ -没别人了
-Who else is here? -Nobody.


1236
01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:16.050
-我在问你，这儿还有谁？ -没有别人了！
-I said, who else is here? -Nobody's here!


1237
01:28:16.210 --> 01:28:17.620
查一下那边
Check in there.


1238
01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.720
你要是敢动，就打爆你的头
You move, I'll take your head off.


1239
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:55.990
现在我欠这家伙和我部门里他那混蛋老婆的情
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife­ Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.


1240
01:28:56.150 --> 01:28:58.250
-现在我把命都押上了 -很抱歉
-Now I owe them both my balls -I'm sorry.


1241
01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.420
-你了解我的 -不是说“没人会知道的”么
-You know I am -"Nobody will know it's me."


1242
01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.650
他们要是发现了怎么办，发现是我给的你那该死的…
You know what happens they don't bury this, that I gave you this?


1243
01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.190
很糟糕，我知道了
It's bad. I know it.


1244
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:08.420
我还有18个月就工作满20你年了，你的举动让我的退休金岌岌可危
I'm 18 months away from my 20. You just put my pension in jeopardy.


1245
01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.560
-你终于说到“重点”了 -那不是什么重点！
-You made your point -It's not a point!


1246
01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.090
-谁报的警？ -什么？
-Who called 911? -What?


1247
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:16.320
大楼空无一人，我是轻手轻脚的，我都没呆多长时间
The building was empty. I was quiet. I wasn't there very long.


1248
01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.920
谁叫警察来的？这些你有没有想过这事…？
Who called it in? Does that make sense to you­?


1249
01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.650
这事结了
This never happened.


1250
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:23.980
你让警察觉得你是个律师
You got these cops thinking you're a lawyer.


1251
01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:26.210
你让律师觉得你是个警察
You got these lawyers thinking you're a cop.


1252
01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:30.520
你把大伙都骗了，不是么？除你之外所有人
You got everybody fooled, don't you? Everybody but you.


1253
01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.790
你很清楚自己是个什么东西
You know exactly what you are.


1254
01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.910
我们给你打过6次电话
We tried calling you six times.


1255
01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.220
但你的答录机一定是坏了还是怎么的
But your machine must be busted or something.


1256
01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:53.550
这是我们最好的技术
We gave it our best shot.


1257
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:57.380
我们的红色封面用完了，库存只有2000…
We ran out of red covers. We only had 2000 in stock­


1258
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:59.420
…因此剩下的1000我们用了蓝色的
­so we did the other thousand in blue.


1259
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:07.880
(内部使用) (北地联合克林泰特除草剂内部研究备忘录229号)

1260
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:22.320
没什么问题吧？
Is everything all right?


1261
01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:23.720
啊，没问题
It's fine, yeah.


1262
01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.480
嗯，你开车了么？因为后面还有25箱…
You have a van or something? Because I have 25 boxes back there­


1263
01:30:27.650 --> 01:30:30.720
帮我个忙，看好它们
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.


1264
01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.120
我下周回来把这些都拉走
I'll come back and pick everything up next week.


1265
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:35.350
-真的么？谢了，伙计 -好的
-Seriously? Thanks, man -Yeah.


1266
01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.250
喂
Hello.


1267
01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:05.620
丹，你们先走，我随后就到
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.


1268
01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:07.490
什么？
What?


1269
01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:17.050
你认识迈克尔·克莱顿么？
Do you know Michael Clayton?


1270
01:31:17.210 --> 01:31:18.710
认识，怎么了？
Yeah, why?


1271
01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.660
我们遇到了新情况
We have a situation.


1272
01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:41.990
嘿，他们找到你了吗？
Hey, did they find you?


1273
01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:45.180
-谁找我？ -马蒂，我想他们还在
-Who? -Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.


1274
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:54.680
马蒂
Marty.


1275
01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:58.220
你电话关机了，好多事都找不着你
Your phone's off. There's too much going on for your phone to be off.


1276
01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.380
-我要单独聊聊 -你看，那个，我们要晚了…
-I need a minute -Yeah, well, we're late­


1277
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:02.190
我们昨天晚上还没做完呢
We never got to finish last night.


1278
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.480
你是最后走的吗？看起来气色很差
Did you close the place? You look like hell.


1279
01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:07.710
-不是，你走之后我就走了 -如果是那样的话
-No, I left right after you left -If you say so.


1280
01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.590
我们忙了一晚上，我们必须发表一项声明
We've been here all night. We had to make an announcement.


1281
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:14.030
简！我需要那个，给我个信封
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.


1282
01:32:14.190 --> 01:32:17.380
我本想让你加入进来，但找不到你，我只好做了决定
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you. I had to pull the trigger.


1283
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:20.490
我让鲍勃·奈斯特和金，可能是用错了
I put Bob Nast and Kim, probably a mistake.


1284
01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:23.980
他们打算这周末举办一个追悼仪式
They're gonna pull together a memorial service by the end of the week.


1285
01:32:24.150 --> 01:32:26.420
我跟他们说了需要帮忙就找你
I told them to call you if they need any help.


1286
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:29.690
不、不，不是，另一个，另一个
No, no, no. The other one. The other one.


1287
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:32.560
我们今早给你开了张支票
So we cut you a check this morning.


1288
01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.020
但有些附加条件，巴里…
There's some strings attached. And Barry­


1289
01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:40.320
这事没商量，巴里必须参与进来
There's no way around this, Barry's gonna have to be involved.


1290
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:46.520
如果亚瑟是在追查某件事情呢？
What if Arthur was on to something?


1291
01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.350
你什么意思？追查什么？
What do you mean? On to what?


1292
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.390
U/North，如果他没疯？如果他是对的呢？
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy? What if he was right?


1293
01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:53.720
什么对了？我们站错了队？
Right about what? That we're on the wrong side?


1294
01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:56.320
站错了队，走错了路，一切，一切都不对
Wrong side, wrong way, everything, all of it.


1295
01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.430
这事新鲜么？这案子从第一天起就臭不可闻
This is news? This case reeked from day one.


1296
01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.580
你都呆了15年了，还要我告诉你我们是怎么赚钱的吗？
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?


1297
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:04.480
他们会怎么做？如果他把事实公之于众呢？
What would they do? What would they do if he went public?


1298
01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:08.060
他们会怎么做？你他妈的傻了吧？他们已经这么做了
What would they do? Are you fucking soft? They're doing it.


1299
01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:10.660
如果我们不能在24小时内彻底解决这事…
We don't straighten the settlement out in 24 hours­


1300
01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.890
…他们就会拒绝支付900万的律师费
­they're gonna withhold $9 million in fees.


1301
01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:16.020
然后他们还会公布亚瑟在密尔沃基跳脱衣舞的录像
Then they'll pull out the video of Arthur doing his flashdance.


1302
01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:17.920
他们会起诉我们玩忽职守
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.


1303
01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:21.750
除了这些之外，与伦敦的合并案也会告吹…
Except there won't be anything to win because the London merger will be dead­


1304
01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:24.580
…大伙就只能回家喝西北风去了
­and we'll be selling off the goddamn furniture.


1305
01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:26.750
这是8万块
That's 80.


1306
01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:29.050
我们管它就叫奖金
We're calling it a bonus.


1307
01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.920
你以现在的年薪续约3年
Three-year contract at your current numbers.


1308
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:33.710
那奖金是将给那个的
That's assuming this all works out.


1309
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:35.050
你现在就办了？
You're doing this now?


1310
01:33:36.710 --> 01:33:40.060
我说，我同意这么办，好吧？但有条件的
Look, I agreed to this, okay? But there's rules now.


1311
01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:43.090
你想要合同，就得签订一份保密协议
You want the contract, you sign a confidentiality agreement.


1312
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:45.350
协议内容不能更改，同时具有追溯效力
It's gonna be bulletproof and retroactive.


1313
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:47.250
因为马蒂这人很友善，不愿意说…
Because Marty's too nice to say it­


1314
01:33:47.410 --> 01:33:51.220
…但就你对这地方的了解，客户和在这儿工作的员工…
­but with all you know about this place, the clients and people who work here­


1315
01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:53.940
…都会对你要价8万块感到有点儿奇怪
­it makes it a little weird when you ask for 80 grand.


1316
01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:57.320
我要是勒索别人，第一个先找你…
If I was gonna shake anybody down, I'd come to you­


1317
01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.150
…而且肯定不会只要8万块，这是你的意思还是他的？
­and it wouldn't be for 80 grand. Is this him or you?


1318
01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.920
-如果我错了，我道歉 -你他妈的完全错了
-If I'm wrong, I apologize -You're way the fuck wrong.


1319
01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:04.310
随你便好了
So there you go.


1320
01:34:04.490 --> 01:34:06.150
够了，你俩，行了吧？
Enough. Okay? Everybody.


1321
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:09.180
他是个混蛋，但他清楚地知道这一点
He's an asshole, but he knows it.


1322
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:12.860
你呢，是公认的(混蛋)，好了吧？大家都高兴了？
And you're on the record. Okay? Everybody happy?


1323
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:16.180
-丹·杰弗瑞来了 -我们就到
-Don Jeffries is here -We're on the way.


1324
01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:21.090
和鲍勃·奈斯特联系一下，看看他们需要帮忙不
Call Bob Nast. Just see if they need help with this thing.


1325
01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:26.020
欢迎回来
You're welcome.


1326
01:35:18.850 --> 01:35:21.230
你说是1万2，这可是7万5啊
You said 12. This is 75.


1327
01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.550
嗯，别激动，你要来一杯吗？
Well, don't get too excited. You want a drink?


1328
01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.590
不，我上班呢
No. I'm working.


1329
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:31.550
现在我们扯平了，那么，不用干别的了
So we're square, then. No bad blood.


1330
01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.420
你只是在尽自己的职责罢了
You're just doing your job.


1331
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:35.050
是啊
That's right.


1332
01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.720
保重，盖比
Take it easy, Gabe.


1333
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.090
你也一样
Michael.


1334
01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:53.260
不跟
Check.


1335
01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.350
不跟
Check.


1336
01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.420
-不跟 -半注，两百
-Check -Half the pot. Two hundred.


1337
01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:00.890
两百胜
Two hundred to go.


1338
01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:39.990
那么，餐馆现在怎么样了
So, what happened with the bar?


1339
01:36:40.150 --> 01:36:42.190
看来你经营的不善啊，哈？
You just had to be a rock star, huh?


1340
01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:07.420
你干什么？你才刚来
What are you doing? You just got here.


1341
01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:09.530
这哥们儿才玩了9手，这就走了
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.


1342
01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:13.850
我把你吓跑了？我干了什么？是我把你吓跑了吗？
I scare you away? What did I do? Did I scare you away?


1343
01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:50.650
快走
Get out.


1344
01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.150
快离开车子
Get out of the car now.


1345
01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:56.880
-沃尔特？ -迈克尔
-Walter? -Michael.


1346
01:37:57.050 --> 01:37:59.250
-迈克尔，谢天谢地，总算找到你 -嗯
-Michael. Thank God you're there -Yeah.


1347
01:38:03.650 --> 01:38:05.590
你还有8秒…
You have eight­


1348
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.220
6、5…
­  six, five­


1349
01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:11.720
4、3…
­  four, three­


1350
01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:13.520
快走
Get out of the car.


1351
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:19.980
-告诉他不要接任何电话了 -好的，你会去吧？
-Tell him to stay off the phone -All right. But you're on it?


1352
01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:22.030
我没被发现吧？
Am I clean?


1353
01:38:22.190 --> 01:38:23.410
接着走
Just keep walking.


1354
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:25.820
收到，我没被发现吧？
You copy. Am I clean?


1355
01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:29.010
走就是了，他正朝他的车走去
Just keep moving. He's walking to the car.


1356
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:33.120
你只要在路上就行了，我会给你带来更多的细节
-to let him know you're on the way. I'll get back to you with the details.


1357
01:38:33.290 --> 01:38:35.720
-给我2分钟 -我马上开车去
-Just give me two minutes -I'll be in the car.


1358
01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:42.860
我没安完，是装上了，但不知道能不能用
I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.


1359
01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:14.550
不是很好，有点儿杂波，他就在前边，但是…
It's loose. I got a pulse. He's up there somewhere, but­


1360
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:18.260
我来看看能不能增强下信号
Let's find a way to boost the signal.


1361
01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:29.020
-我不知道沃尔特给了你什么承诺… -一位天才员工！
-I don't know what Walter promised you­ -A miracle worker!


1362
01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:32.420
沃尔特在电话里是这么说的，20分钟前，原话要听么，啊？
That's Walter on the phone, 20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?


1363
01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:34.420
“挺住，我会派一个天才来帮助你”
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."


1364
01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:36.250
-喔，那他说错了 -哪儿说错了？
-Well, he misspoke -About what?


1365
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:39.950
关于你是公司的救火员那部份？还是你根本就不在行？
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer? Or that you're any good at it?


1366
01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:47.660
我们走，有信号了
We're up. Just got a signal.


1367
01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:13.850
这条路上毫无人烟，他在干什么？
There's nothing back this way. What's he doing?


1368
01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:15.210
也许他迷路了
Maybe he's lost.


1369
01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.190
-等一下 -他来了
-Wait a minute -That's him.


1370
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:21.760
他一个人，是吧？
He was alone, right?


1371
01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:24.720
-是，我觉得是 -确定点儿，是还是不是？
-Yeah, I think so -Call it, yes or no?


1372
01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:28.780
我们得调头回去
We gotta turn around.


1373
01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:00.620
说话啊
Talk to me.


1374
01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:02.350
讯号断断续续的
It's strobing.


1375
01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:04.920
不，走得对，我想我们走得对，接着开
No, we're good. I think we're good. Just keep going.


1376
01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.320
不，他转弯了，不知道为什么他转弯了
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.


1377
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:23.850
-哪儿？ -他在…
-Where? -He took­


1378
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.320
-他转左了 -左边哪儿有叉路啊
-He took a left -I don't have a left.


1379
01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.220
-东面，他在东南面 -什么，我们跟丢了？
-East. He's southeast -What, so we missed it?


1380
01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:41.520
-可能是地图有问题 -别着急
-Or the grid is wrong -Hang on.


1381
01:41:51.690 --> 01:41:54.380
-我们得回到原点 -原点是什么？哪算原点？
-We gotta go back to one -One is what? Where's our one?


1382
01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:57.580
直走半英里，一直开，开就是了
Half a mile straight ahead. Just keep driving. Just go.


1383
01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.080
现实是我们接近了，但那是西面，不是东边
It says we're closing. But that's west. It can't be west.


1384
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:08.320
信号还是地图的问题？
The signal or the grid?


1385
01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:11.220
-可能都有，讯号减弱了 -该死的
-It's both. It just keeps dropping out -Goddamn it.


1386
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:03.850
把电话给我
Give me the cell.


1387
01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.080
我们的信号很好
Our signaI's good.


1388
01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.150
怎么了？
What?


1389
01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:51.490
谢了，米奇
Thanks, Mickey.


1390
01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:53.310
带我离开这儿
Just get me out of here.


1391
01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:04.750
我要这个会议的时间安排表，越快越好，最晚周四
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this, soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.


1392
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:08.550
我觉得我们得找个来自裁决组的人，麦克戴尔可以…
I think we should have someone from the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell­


1393
01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:10.220
-嗯？ -你听说了么？
-Yeah? -Did you hear?


1394
01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:12.920
-是啊，听说了，U/North结案了 -不是，是迈克尔·克莱顿的事
-Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North -No. Michael Clayton.


1395
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:14.410
什么？
What?


1396
01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:17.490
汽车炸弹，远郊，今天早晨，他被杀了
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning. He was killed.


1397
01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:19.550
什么？
What?


1398
01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:23.050
天啊
Holy shit.


1399
01:45:37.210 --> 01:45:42.160
U/North公司依然坚持认为这场诉讼是…
It has been and it remains the U/North position­


1400
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:46.420
证据不足而且毫无道理可言的
­  that this lawsuit is baseless and without merit.


1401
01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:50.650
基于原告方要求支付超过30亿美元的赔偿金…
Our reluctance to negotiate was anchored by this belief­


1402
01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:55.980
我们的态度和以前一样，甚至更坚决…
­and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand for settlement­


1403
01:45:56.150 --> 01:45:58.720
…不愿谈判
­in excess of 3 billion dollars.


1404
01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.350
但今天我们聚集在这里…
The reason that we are all here today is­


1405
01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:06.390
…是因为本案的一些关键因素已经发生了变化
­that several key elements in the case have changed.


1406
01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:11.830
你们手中都有一份计划中的一揽子解决方案…
You all have a tentative proposal packet­


1407
01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:16.380
…上面标出了细节，关键之处在于这点：
­  which outlines the details, but the bottom line is this:


1408
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:19.320
在过去的几个月里，有消息指出…
Over the past several months we had gotten word­


1409
01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.830
原告的耐心开始不足…
­that the plaintiffs were growing impatient­


1410
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:26.820
…他们正在修改要求赔偿金的数目
­and were in the process of revising their settlement numbers.


1411
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:28.790
我们也了解到…
We also learned­


1412
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:32.900
原告的律师费上限为32%…
­  that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees were capped at 32 percent­


1413
01:46:33.050 --> 01:46:35.150
最高4亿美元…
­  up to 400 million dollars­


1414
01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:39.820
…超过的部份，律师费将降为24%
­above which, their fees dropped to 24 percent.


1415
01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:44.550
因此我们知道这种两难的境地让他们…
So we knew that there would be this motivational dead zone for them­


1416
01:46:44.710 --> 01:46:46.050
…止步不前
­in the middle there.


1417
01:46:46.810 --> 01:46:48.520
最后…
Finally­


1418
01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:53.030
…我们的财务部门告知我们他们计算出了
­our finance team informed us that they had run the numbers­


1419
01:46:53.190 --> 01:46:55.020
赔偿金及税款的总额…
­and that the tax benefit­


1420
01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:58.420
如果我们能将赔偿金控制在6亿美元以下…
­provided that we bring the settlement in under 600 million­


1421
01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:01.030
在这一财政年度内…
­and within this fiscal year­


1422
01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:07.050
…公司业绩就可以弥补赔偿金带来的损失
­that the write-off on this settlement would essentially pay for itself.


1423
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:11.760
你们面前的一揽子解决方案，就我看来…
The package that you have before you represents, in my judgment­


1424
01:47:12.190 --> 01:47:16.990
…是公司在目前情况下的最好选择
­  the strongest possible position for our company under the circumstances.


1425
01:47:17.150 --> 01:47:18.850
同时，作为首席顾问…
And, as chief counsel­


1426
01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:22.290
…我建议你们通过这一方案
­it is my recommendation that this proposal be confirmed.


1427
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:26.880
谢谢你，凯伦，我们需要几分钟时间来讨论一下这个问题
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us a few minutes to talk about it.


1428
01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:29.320
好的，我在外面等
Certainly. I'll be right outside.


1429
01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:32.720
嗯…
Well­


1430
01:47:55.810 --> 01:47:57.650
里面情况怎么样？
How'd it go in there?


1431
01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:02.890
吓坏了吧，哈？
Pretty freaky, huh?


1432
01:48:03.050 --> 01:48:06.020
你看见亚瑟了么？他就在附近出没
Did you see Arthur? He's wandering around here somewhere.


1433
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:11.820
我开玩笑呢，放松点儿
I'm kidding. Lighten up.


1434
01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:17.080
你收到这个了吗？这备忘录写的不错，虽然年头久了点儿，但内容很好
You got one of these? It's a great memo. It's an oldie but a goodie.


1435
01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:21.730
我让你心跳加速了，是不是？
Got your heart racing, don't I?


1436
01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:24.010
我不知道你这样做是想干什么
I don't know what it is you think you're doing.


1437
01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:25.550
你觉得我这样做是想干什么？
What do you think I'm doing?


1438
01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:27.520
案子结了，我们和解了
The suit's over. We have a deal.


1439
01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:30.390
不管那是什么，现在都没用了
Whatever that is, it's meaningless at this point.


1440
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:34.210
你这么认为？这样啊，我还以为你只是提出一个建议方案呢
You think? I must have gotten it wrong. I thought you had a tentative proposal.


1441
01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.580
我还没想到这些钱都是你给的呢
I didn't realize you'd signed all those checks.


1442
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:40.060
这是个累赘，我有上千本，我拿它们怎么办？
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these. What am I gonna do with them?


1443
01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.560
我要给马蒂打电话
I'm calling Marty.


1444
01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:44.080
好，好啊，打吧，那会是个很好的开始
Good. Good. Do it. That's a great place to start.


1445
01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.050
让我们看看是谁告诉他亚瑟和安娜·凯泽森联系
Let's find out who told him Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.


1446
01:48:47.210 --> 01:48:49.060
让我们看看是谁窃听的电话
Let's find out who tapped those phones.


1447
01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:53.030
这本备忘录，我对其真实性有异议，我强烈怀疑…
This memorandum, even if it's authentic, which I doubt, I highly doubt­


1448
01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:56.620
-我知道你对亚瑟做了些什么 -这是受保护的文件，它属于U/North公司
-I know what you did to Arthur -It's protected. It belongs to U/North.


1449
01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.550
-我知道是你杀了他 -这是律师和客户之间的隐私
-I know you killed him -It's attorney-client privilege.


1450
01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:03.380
凯伦，你看，现在，事情不该是这样的
See, now, that's just not the way to go here, Karen.


1451
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:06.250
对于一个这么聪明的人来说，你有点儿不知所措了，是不是？
For such a smart person, you really are lost, aren't you?


1452
01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:07.750
谈话结束
This conversation is over.


1453
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:11.360
我不是你该除掉的人，我是你该收买的人
I'm not the guy that you kill. I'm the guy that you buy.


1454
01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.040
你他妈的瞎到连我是什么人都没看出来？
Are you so fucking blind you don't even see what I am?


1455
01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:17.710
我是你整个儿环节上最容易的一环，你还想做了我？
I'm the easiest part of your whole goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?


1456
01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:21.150
你不知道我谁么？我是救火队员，我是跑腿的
Don't you know who I am? I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.


1457
01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.720
我经手的人从顺手牵羊的主妇到贪赃枉法的国会议员…
I do everything from shoplifting housewives to bent congressmen­


1458
01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.790
…你还想做了我？
­and you're gonna kill me?


1459
01:49:27.710 --> 01:49:30.560
你想要什么，凯伦？告诉我
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.


1460
01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.410
你想要枪支携带证明？还是想要关于内线交易传票的警告
You want a carry permit? You want a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?


1461
01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:38.420
我8万块和一纸合同就把亚瑟卖了，你还想做了我？
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand and a contract and you're gonna kill me?


1462
01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.360
你想要什么？
What do you want?


1463
01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:43.040
我想要什么？
What do I want?


1464
01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:44.810
我要更多
I want more.


1465
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:47.090
我要不干了
I want out.


1466
01:49:47.250 --> 01:49:49.890
有这个，我什么都要
And with this, I want everything.


1467
01:49:51.650 --> 01:49:52.890
开个价吧？
Is there a number?


1468
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:54.650
我的要价是10
Ten is a number.


1469
01:49:54.810 --> 01:49:56.850
10？10什么？
Ten? Ten what?


1470
01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.380
1000万？
Ten million?


1471
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:03.990
你觉得我上哪儿搞那1000万去？
Where do you think I'm gonna get 10 million dollars?


1472
01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:06.450
你知道这东西哪点好么？
You know what's great about this?


1473
01:50:06.610 --> 01:50:08.920
你看到结尾了吗？你看到谁签署的了吗？
Did you read it to the end? You see who signed it?


1474
