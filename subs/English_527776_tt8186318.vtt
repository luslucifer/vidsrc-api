Hannah, I believe you were told
your father died to protect you.

My father's alive?

He wants to meet you,
but only if you want to.

anything that you don't want to do.

Why did he leave?

How'd your race go today?

He was in his 30s.

You don't need to be worrying about that.

God went to great lengths
to express His love for you.

You've heard in Bible class
how Jesus died on the cross.

But do you understand why?

1126
01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:16.180
No. Not really.

1127
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:20.620
You were created to know Him...

1128
01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:21.984
and to worship Him.

1129
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:25.943
But we reject Him
when we do wrong.


1130
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:31.064
When we sin, that's the thing
that separates us from Him.


1131
01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:34.420
So He sent His Son

1132

to pay the price
to get you back.


1133

And it was a painful price.

1134
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:41.788
But then He rose from the dead,

1135
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:44.948
and He made a way for you
to get right with God...

1138
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:50.870
That's faith.

1139
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:54.061
But He doesn't force it on you.

1140
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:57.381
He just offers it to you
because He loves you.

We've all sinned, Hannah.

We've all lied or
stolen or hated...


1143
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:09.266
But when we give
our heart to Jesus,


1144
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.463
He starts cleaning it.

1145
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:15.263
He takes better care of
it than we ever could.

CINDY: Good afternoon.

1433
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:12.866
We have three rule changes
for consideration this year.


1434
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:14.509
A few of our schools
have requested


1435
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:17.343
that runners be allowed to
wear earbuds during a race.


1436
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:20.388
Now, while this association can
modify the rules for our events,


1437
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:22.620
we have two problems
with this request.


1438
01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:25.782
One, we need runners to hear
any signals or warning sounds


1439
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:28.146
during the race, and secondly,

1440
01:31:28.230 --> 01:31:31.507
any live communication to the runner
would give them an unfair advantage.


1441
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:35.266
So we have a solution that we
are presenting to you coaches


1442
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:37.182
to vote on for this race.

1443
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:41.946
If a runner wears only one small earbud
and the content is prerecorded only,


1444
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:44.067
we will allow it,
pending your vote.


1445
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:47.026
- Any questions?
- This is ridiculous.


1446
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:49.579
CINDY: Yes?
- And the content is fair game,


1447
01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.786
- as long as it's prerecorded?
CINDY: That is right.


1448
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:53.827
There is no live communication.

1449
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:57.430
All right.
We will just go around the room,


1450
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:59.501
and get a yes or no vote
from each of you. Paul?
